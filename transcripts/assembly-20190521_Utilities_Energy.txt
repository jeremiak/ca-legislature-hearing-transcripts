MINUTES OR SO -- TO TO COME TOGETHER AND THEN WE'LL START WITH WHOEVER'S HERE I WILL ALLOW. ALL OF YOU TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A PRESENTATIONS AND HEAR THEM. IN A TIMELY WAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE WE'RE GOING. TO CONVENE OUR INFORMATIONAL HEARING TODAY'S UTILITY AND ENERGY COMMITTEE. I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE AND FOR THE MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE PRESENT A TIME BUT WE'RE ALSO EXPECTING OTHER MEMBERS TO JOIN US -- THIS -- HEARING WE'RE GONNA HAVE BROKEN INTO TO A DIFFERENT -- SECTIONS ONE A PRESENTATION ON WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS. AND THE OTHER IS OVER SIDE AND EVALUATION. I'LL GO THROUGH IN IT ENTER DO SO THE MEMBERS OF THE PANELS. THAT WILL BE MAKING A PRESENTATION BEFORE US -- WILL -- MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S TIME AT THE END OF THIS -- HEARING TO ALLOW FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. AND I WOULD -- LIKE TO START OUT BY JUST BASICALLY REMINDING ALL OF US THAT IS THIS -- COMMITTEE ADDRESSES MANY ISSUES THE MOST CRITICAL. ISSUE FACING THIS COMMITTEE IS ENSURING THAT WE HAVE TAKEN THE STEPS NECESSARY TO REDUCE THE RISK AN OCCURRENCE OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. IGNITED BY UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE. THE FOUNDATION THAT WORK. THE FOUNDATION OF THAT WORK IS EMBODIED AND THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY WHILE FAR MITIGATION PLANS WHICH ARE. THE FOCUS OF TODAY'S HEARING. THE PLANS ARE NOT NEW BUT LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE IMPORT AND REQUIREMENTS OF THE PLANS. NEW PLANS WERE FILED IN FEBRUARY IN THE CPUC PUT ALL HANDS ON DECK. HOW TO MOVE THOSE PLANS THROUGH THE REVIEW PROCESS? THIS ISN'T A ONE TIME EFFORT. THE PLANS AND RELATED SAFETY WORK BY CAL FIRE -- YES AND THE CPUC AND OTHER STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES ARE NOW IN BED IT AS PRIORITIES AND THE STATE. TODAY WE HAVE THE THREE LARGEST ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS BEFORE US TO PRESENT KEY ELEMENTS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE PLANS. WE ALSO REALLY WANT TO HEAR ABOUT BARRIERS TO FULL EXECUTION OF THOSE PLANS. AS WE ARE NOW AS WE'VE SAID AND HEARD MANY TIMES -- IN A NEW FRONT TIER AND DEALING WITH A NEW SET OF EXPANDING CHALLENGES AROUND THE CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. OUR SECOND PANEL WILL PROVIDE A REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE ON THE PLANS REVIEW. AND SO AS I INDICATED WE WILL START OFF BY FIRST HEARING FROM. A NUMBER OF PROFESSIONALS THAT WILL PRESENT ON WALL FIRE MITIGATION PLANS. AND AS I CALL YOUR NAME PLEASE FEEL FREE TO COME UP TO THE FRONT TABLE HERE AND WE WILL BEGIN -- IN THE ORDER OF WHICH YOU'RE CALLED IN YOUR PRESENTATION. A BRAND THE AGOSTINO WHO'S THE DIRECTOR FIRE SCIENCE AND CLIMATE ADAPTATION SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC. PHIL HARRINGTON SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. S. MATT SIGN. A VICE PRESIDENT COMMUNITY WHILE FIRE SAFETY PROGRAM PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC. SO WE WELCOME ALL OF YOU AND WE THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR PRESENTATION AND THEN WE'LL. TURN TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS AT THE END OF YOUR PRESENTATION FOR ANY QUESTIONS THEY MAY HAVE. I WILL START WITH THE RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. COMMITTEE MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE FOR THE CHEST. A LITTLE CLOSER THERE WE GO TIME TO TALK ABOUT OUR WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLAN -- IT'S NOT A NEW THING AS THE CHAIR MENTIONED -- SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC -- HAS BEEN ACTIVELY -- PURSUING -- MITIGATION PLANS NOW FOR OVER A DECADE AND IS ALREADY INVESTED OVER ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS -- IN HARDENING THE SYSTEM AND A LOT OF WHAT I'M GOING -- TO SHARE WITH YOU IS ONE THAT THE QUESTION AT THE TOP OF THE AGENDA ARE THESE PLANS REALLY MITIGATING THAT POTENTIAL. FOR CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE ON THE ANSWER FROM SAN DIEGO IS YES -- THEY ARE SINCE WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THIS PLAN OVER A DECADE AGO WE HAVE NOT SEEN -- IN A CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRESCOMIC KNIGHTED BY ELECTRICAL. EQUIPMENT ACROSS OUR REGION -- BUT WHAT THAT HASN'T STOPPED IS CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT ND WE REALLY FOCUS IN THREE AREAS ONE IS THE OPERATIONS IN THE ENGINEERING OF THE SYSTEM. ANOTHER GETS INTO OUR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND WHETHER TECHNOLOGY AND THEN WE FOCUS VERY CLOSELY ON CUSTOMER OUTREACH. ON AN EDUCATION AND PART OF WHAT I'M GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY IS SOME OF THE NEWER COMPONENTS IN THE EVOLUTION OF OUR WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLAN -- AND WHERE IT IS TODAY AND PART OF THE FOCUS ON THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PLAN IS REALLY GETTING INTO FUEL MANAGEMENT -- I WILL TOUCH ON VEGETATION MANAGEMENT BUT THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY. FOR THE UTILITIES TO WORK WITH THE FIRE AGENCIES WITH THE FEDERAL AGENCIES LIKE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT AND START USING EASEMENTS. AS FIRE BREAKS THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVEN'T. DONE EXTENSIVELY IN THE PAST AND WE'RE REALLY EXPANDING IT AS PART OF THIS YEAR'S PLAN -- ANOTHER AREA THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS ENHANCING OUR IGNITION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WE'VE TRACKED -- IGNITIONS COMING FROM. THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM BUT NOW WE'RE TRACKING EVERY SPARK IF WE CAN AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND AND STUDY THIS AND REALLY START -- TO APPLY SCIENTIFIC METHODS TO IGNITIONS COMING FROM THE SYSTEM AND START TO IDENTIFY TRENDS -- TO FURTHER MITIGATE THOSE IN THAT TO A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR PLAN. IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN USING AS A TOOL IN SAN DIEGO NOW. FOR ALMOST A DECADE -- AND IT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE AND OF COURSE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WE'VE LEARNED A LOT OF LESSONS AS WE'VE HAD TO IMPLEMENT IT -- ON A BROADER SCALE THAN WE'VE EVER HAD TO PREVIOUSLY -- BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING THIS YEAR IS WERE GOING IN AND TRYING TO ADD ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT. IN PLACES WHERE IT MAKES SENSE BASED OFF ALL OF OUR WEATHER INFORMATION AND START TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT. THAT IT HAS ON OUR COMMUNITIES IF IT MAKES SENSE IN SOME CASES IF WE PUT EQUIPMENT -- JUST TO ISOLATE SMALLER AMOUNTS OF CUSTOMERS THAT'S A MOVE THAT WE'RE DOING AND IN ADDITION TO MINIMIZING THE IMPACT IT ALSO ENABLES US -- IN SOME CASES TO REENERGIZE MORE QUICKLY -- AFTER AN EVENT HAS PASSED -- SO THAT'S A LARGE FOCUS OF OUR PLANNED COMING INTO THIS YEAR. VEGETATION MANAGEMENT HAS ALWAYS BEEN -- SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN EXTREMELY AGGRESSIVE ACT IN SAN DIEGO. FOR OVER THE LAST DECADE BUT WE'RE REALLY EXPANDING THAT PROGRAM AGAIN THIS YEAR AS PART OF OUR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLAN. OUR INSPECTION RATE. IS BEING DOUBLE -- SO WE WILL GET HIGHS THROUGH OUR ENTIRE HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS TWICE AND THAT WILL ALL BE -- INSPECTED. IN ADDITION WHEN WE SEE A MAJOR EVENT COMING. WILL BE TARGETING THOSE WINDIEST AREAS -- AND GOING IN AND DOING PRE INSPECTIONS CHEST BEFORE AN EVENT -- TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T FIND ANY -- ANY ISSUES WITH THE VEGETATION IN THAT AREA. WE'RE ALSO INCREASING OUR POSTS TRAM. IN SOME CASES WHERE IT MAKES SENSE UP TO EVEN TWENTY FIVE FEET -- BUT WE'RE VERY AGGRESSIVE WITH OUR PUBLIC POST TRAM CLEARANCES RIGHT NOW AND THEN THE OTHER MAJOR COMPONENT THIS YEAR IS WERE REALLY TAKING ALL OF THE TREES THAT WE TRACK ALMOST HALF A MILLION. AND CORRELATING IT TO ALL OF OUR WEATHER INFORMATION. BECAUSE WE KNOW NOW SOME TREES ARE IN NGUYEN CORRIDORS AND WE HAVE ALL THE WEATHER INFORMATION WE HAVE ALL THIS TREE INFORMATION. SO IT'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO START TYING THESE TWO TOGETHER AND MAKE SOME SMART DECISIONS AND START TO UNDERSTAND WHERE. THOSE TREES WOULD BE MOST PRONE -- TO IMPACTS SO THOSE ARE SOME OF OUR ENHANCEMENTS WITH BADGE ANAGEMENT THIS YEAR -- ARE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS PROGRAM AT SDG ANY -- HAS BEEN RIGHT NOW -- OF ALL BEING VERY QUICKLY FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS AND IT CONTINUES TO INVOLVE OUR WEATHER NETWORK -- CURRENTLY IS AT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN WEATHER STATIONS ON THAT NETWORK IS BEING REBUILT AND IT'S EXPANDING -- DOWN INTO COASTAL AREAS COASTAL CANYONS. THE CAMERA NETWORK WHICH CURRENTLY THERE'S OVER A HUNDRED CAMERAS BEING MONITORED FROM MOUNTAIN TOPS ACROSS THE REGION -- THAT'S BEING EXPANDED. STILL IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH CAL FIRE IN THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM ALL OF OUR TOOLS -- LIKE THE FIRE POTENTIAL IMPACTS IN THE SAND AND A WILDFIRE THREAD INDEX WHICH IS BUILT WITH THE FOR SERVICE THOSE ARE ALL BEING AND WE'RE ADDING DATA APPLICATIONS TO IT ADDING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE WHERE WE CAN WITH THIS FIRE POTENTIAL INDEX. AND CONTINUING TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE ON THESE TOOLS -- MOVING FORWARD AND THEN ALSO ARE WILDFIRE RISK REDUCTION MODEL WHICH CAN SIMULATE FIRE BEHAVIOR WE'RE INCORPORATING OUR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT DATA INTO THAT SYSTEM SO WE CAN ACTUALLY DEVELOP RISK PROFILES FOR TREES. WITHIN THE SYSTEM SAYING IF IF A FIRE WOULD ORIGINATE FROM THIS CLUSTER OF TREES IT WOULD END UP BEING VERY CATASTROPHIC FOR DOWN WIND COMMUNITY. AND WE'RE STARTING TO TIE ALL THESE SYSTEMS TOGETHER -- NOW MOVING FORWARD BUT THE INTELLIGENCE IS NOT JUST WITH ALL THE WEATHER INFORMATION THERE'S ALSO INTELLIGENCE ON THE SYSTEM WITH PROTECTIVE DEVICES. AND WE'RE INVESTING IN NOW FALLING CONDUCTOR PROTECTION WHERE WE HAVE SENSORS BUT IF THE LINE BREAKS. THE SENSORS WILL SENSE THAT BEFORE THE LINE HITS THE GROUND. AND TURN IT OFF THAT REQUIRES UNINTERRUPTED VERY STABLE COMMUNICATION ON THE SYSTEM SO ES DE GENIE IS BUILDING A PRIVATE LTE. AS PART OF THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN WE THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE. A CRITICAL COMPONENT -- MOVING FORWARD TO HAVE THE TYPE OF COMMUNICATION THAT WE NEED FOR THE GREAT OF THE FUTURE CAN YOU JUSTIFY AN LTV IT'S A LONG TERM EVOLUTION IT'S ACTUALLY A CELL COMMUNICATION TERM -- WE'VE HEARD OF FIVE G.. AS SAID TYPE OF LTE NETWORK BUT IT'S A COMMUNICATION THAT WILL ENABLE PROTECTIVE DEVICES ON THE SYSTEM. TO COMMUNICATE IN REAL TIME. WE ONLY ASK BECAUSE OF THE TWO HUNDRED OR SO -- LIST OF ACRONYMS THAT ONE WEAPON OF WITH LOU ONE THAT'S NOT ON IT YEAH THANK YOU -- THE CUSTOMER OUT REACH CONTINUES TO EXPAND AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WERE -- PUTTING A LOT OF EFFORT INTO -- THIS YEAR BOTH ON STATEWIDE -- CAMPAIGNS WORKING WITH COLLEAGUES IN CALLOW WE ASK BUT THEN LOCALLY IN SAN DIEGO DOING DOCUMENTARIES. THAT WILL BE AIRING ON LOCAL TELEVISION TO HELP EDUCATE OUR CUSTOMER BASE -- ON THE UP COMING. UP PUBLIC SAFETY POWER OFFICE -- OUR ENTERPRISE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM IS BEING MODIFIED SO THAT IT CAN HANDLE HIGHER CALL VOLUMES AND DUE TO A TEXTING. SO THAT WE CAN DO AUTOMATED TEXTING WITH CUSTOMERS SO THAT WE'RE FINDING WAYS TO EASE THE COMMUNICATION -- WITH THOSE CUSTOMERS WE'RE CONTINUING TO PARTNER WITH YOU SEE ES DE ON COMMUNICATIONS I'M NOT ONLY TO STABILIZE THE CAMERA NETWORKS AND THAT SITUATIONAL AWARENESS BUT THIS ALSO BRINGS INTERNET TO ALL OF THE BACK COUNTRY FIRE STATIONS. SO WE'RE STABILIZING THAT SO THAT IT COULD WITHSTAND A PROLONGED PS PS EVENT -- WITHOUT -- PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF EVENT -- WITHOUT LOSING INTERNET CONNECTIVITY -- TO BACK COUNTRY FIRE STATIONS. AND THE MORE ALSO RIGHT NOW JUST IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A GENERATOR GRANT PROGRAM. AND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS ACTUALLY PROVIDING HAD LIKE A BATTERY GENERATOR THAT SOLAR POWERED THAT SOMEBODY COULD USE TO POWER -- PIECE OF LIFE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT SO THE EXAMPLE I THINK IF SOMEBODY'S ON DIALYSIS -- WE'RE STARTING THIS GENERATOR GRANT PROGRAM THIS A THIRD PARTY INVOLVED -- BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WE'RE JUST DEVELOPING THIS YEAR TAKING LESSONS LEARNED IN LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN IMPLEMENT THAT. INTO OUR COMMUNITY MORE EXTENSIVELY. MOVING FORWARD. AND THEN WE'VE ALSO -- INITIATE A COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS AND THESE ARE AREAS THAT WOULD BE PRONE TO THESE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHOT OFFICE. AND HOW WE HAVE IT SET UP NOW WE WOULD BRING A GENERATOR OUT TO THIS AREA AND KEEP A COMMUNITY CENTER ENERGIZED WE HAVE REPRESENTATIVES THERE THAT COULD GIVE INFORMATION BUT THEN ALSO CHARGE CELLPHONES. WE'VE BROUGHT ICE TRUCKS WATER TRUCKS THINGS THAT WE CAN PROVIDE SOME RESOURCES TO THIS COMMUNITY WE OPEN SIX OF THEM LAST YEAR. WAS VERY WELL RECEIVED -- WE'RE EXPANDING THAT THIS YEAR WILL BE UP -- TO ELEVEN BY THIS YEAR -- BUT OTHER THINGS WERE CONTINUING TO MOVE WE DO FEEL THAT -- MICROGRAMS HAVE A PLACE IN RESILIENCE IN THE BACK COUNTRY OF SAN DIEGO. SO I DRAW THE ATTENTION TO ASSEMBLY BILL -- TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY EIGHT WHICH RIGHT NOW IS TRYING TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT SOME STORAGE AND BATTERY AT SOME SUBSTATIONS ONE OF THOSE SUBSTATIONS AS BOULEVARD IT'S IN A HIGH FIRE RISK AREA -- THAT WE OPERATE -- AND RIGHT NOW WITH WITH THIS IT'S SAYING THAT IT DOES HAVE TO GO OUT FOR BIDS SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A TWO TO THREE YEAR DELAY. BASED OFF THE PROPOSED DECISION FROM THE P. YOU SEE RIGHT NOW. TO GET THIS IMPLEMENTED SO WE FEEL LIKE THIS IS A A REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO START MAKING. SOME MORE PROGRESS ON RESILIENCE OF THE BACK COUNTRY. AND THEN THE LAST POINT THAT I WANTED TO MAKE TODAY BEFORE CONCLUDING IS THAT THE THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS OF COURSE THE PROPOSED DECISION HAS BEEN PUT FORTH. AND OVERALL THE DECISION IS THAT IT HAS DECIDED TO BE FUNDED THROUGH THE G. R. C. -- WHICH WE THINK IS COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE AND RIGHT NOW THAT THE G. R. C. FOR US THE GENIE WAS DUE BY THE END OF LAST YEAR -- SO WE ARE RIGHT NOW SIX MONTHS. BEHIND SCHEDULE ON THAT. NOT THAT IS NOT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM SLOWING DOWN OUR PROGRESS ON OUR WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN -- BUT AT THE SAME TIME FOR THE OVERALL FINANCIAL HEALTH AND AND STABILITY WE THINK TIMELY RESPONSE TO THE G. R. C. IS IMPORTANT. AND EVEN MORE SO WITH THE RECENT PASSING OF SENATE BILL -- FOURTEEN TEN WE THINK THAT RIGHT NOW THE COMMISSION HAS THE ABILITY TO EXTEND OUR THREE YEAR G. R. C. TO A FOUR YEAR G. R. C.. AND WHAT THAT WOULD DO IS THAT IF WE HAVE DELAYS LIKE THIS IT WOULD BE LESS IMPACTFUL -- GENERAL RATE CASE THANK YOU THE GENERAL RATE CASE BEING LATE WOULD BE LESS IMPACTFUL -- IF WE DID HAVE A FOUR YEAR -- GENERAL RATE CASE CYCLE. SO WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE AND LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION AND I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT THERE WILL BE ACRONYMS OF USE THAT WILL COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND. BUT THE PUBLIC WATCHING PROBABLY WILL NOT HAVE A CLUE SO IF YOU CAN JUST SORT OF YOU KNOW DUMB IT DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT I THINK I SHOULD SAY LIKE THAT BUT MAKE IT MORE UNDERSTANDABLE. FOR OTHERS WHO ARE WATCHING I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL POINT TAKEN THANK YOU. CHURCHILL HOLDEN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS -- UNTIL HARRINGTON DOES HE VICE PRESIDENT TRANSMISSION DISTRIBUTION FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON -- WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY AGAIN -- WE WERE -- BEFORE -- I COMMITTEE EARLIER LAST YEAR LATE LAST YEAR -- TALK ABOUT A WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANNING PROGRAMS -- SO THIS IS SOMETHING OF AN UPDATE BUT THERE'S A LOT OF NEW INFORMATION HERE AS WELL AND OF COURSE -- AS UTILITIES WE DO LOVE OUR ACRONYM SO I WILL DO MY BEST -- TO TO ELIMINATE THEM FROM THEIR PRESENTATION BUT IF I MISS -- PLEASE LET ME KNOW. SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY ARE WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS THAT AS HE IS PUT IN PLACE. AND MAYBE TO TAKE A STEP BACK WE WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE BACKGROUND OF SOME OF THE PLANS HOW THEY'VE COME TO BE. AND HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR PLANS OF OVER IMPLEMENTING RIGHT NOW. THEY BUILD UPON -- PROGRAMS WE'VE HAD FOR MANY YEARS -- THINGS WE'VE DONE IN RESPONSE TO RED FLAG WARNINGS -- THIS IS -- INCIPIENT CONDITIONS OF HIGH FIRE RISK -- WE HAVE TRADITIONALLY HAD DESIGN STANDARDS WERE DIFFERENT AND OUR HIGH FAR AREAS OPERATIONAL PRACTICES AROUND VEGETATION MANAGEMENT -- OPERATIONS IN TERMS OF BLOCKING A RE CLOSER TO I BELIEVE WE'RE THE FIRST UTILITY TO PUT THOSE IN PLACE -- MANY YEARS AGO -- SO WE HAD A LOT OF PROGRAMS IN PLACE BUT WE RECOGNIZE OBVIOUSLY WITH THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS -- THAT'S NOT ENOUGH SO TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR EMPLOYEES LIVE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES -- WE NEED TO DO MORE AND THAT'S WHAT THE PLAN WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TODAY WILL BE ABOUT. AS WE LOOK FORWARD WE BROADLY CATEGORIZE THINGS -- ACROSS THREE ELEMENTS -- HARDING INFRASTRUCTURE -- BOLSTER SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND ENHANCING OUR OPERATIONAL PRACTICES WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EACH ONE OF THOSE -- AS WE AS WE ROLL THROUGH THE DISCUSSION HERE. SO -- WANTING OF THESE IMPORTANT -- SIZE AND SCOPE OF OUR SYSTEMS -- WE HAVE A FIFTY THOUSAND MILE SERVICE TERRITORY AND ABOUT A THIRD OF THAT IS IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREA. SO THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE WERE ADDRESSING IS VERY LARGE -- WE HAVE AROUND A MILLION TREES IN OUR TRIM INVENTORY -- FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND THOSE ARE IN HIGH FIRE AREAS AND FRANKLY THAT NUMBER WILL INCREASE AS WE IMPLEMENT EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE PROGRAMS TO TRAIN VEGETATION. IN THE HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS -- SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE A LOT OF AREA AND WE'RE MOVING VERY QUICKLY -- TO OUR PROGRAMS -- TO ADDRESS ALL OF THAT TERRITORY. SO ONE OF THINGS FOR US THAT IS REALLY CRITICAL -- AND I THINK IT'S CRITICAL FOR EVERYBODY TO UNDERSTAND IS HOW WE APPROACH -- WHERE AND WHEN AND HOW WE INVEST AND IMPROVE OPERATIONAL PRACTICES -- WE DO THIS THROUGH A RISK INFORMED ONES -- WE HAVE EVOLVED OUR RISK MANAGEMENT ON A RISK ASSESSMENT TECHNOLOGY WE'RE USING MORE MORE MACHINE LEARNING AND HOW WE DRESS AND LOOK AT OUR CIRCUITS ARE PERFORMING. UNDER HIGH -- IN EXTREME CONDITIONS ALL THIS IS HELPING TO INFORM WHERE AND WHEN AND WHAT WE DO TO OUR SYSTEM. IF WE THINK ABOUT A FOR OUR SYSTEM. MOST OF THE CONSEQUENTIAL EVENTS THAT HAPPENED RELATIVE -- TO IGNITIONS ARE SYSTEM OCCUR ON THE DISTRIBUTION SIDE WE DO HAVE SOME TRANSMISSION BUT THE BULK OF THOSE AROUND DISTRIBUTION AS WELL I WILL SEE A LOT OF DISCUSSION TODAY FOCUSED ON WHAT WE'RE DOING ON THE DISTRIBUTION SIDE. WE DO HAVE MANY PROGRAMS AND MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS DO ADDRESS TRANSMISSION AS WELL BUT IF YOU WONDER WHY THERE'S A DISTRIBUTION FOCUS IT'S REALLY BASED ON A RISK INFORMED LANCE SO -- WITHIN THAT CATEGORY IS ATION THE THREE BUCKETS SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OPERATION PRACTICES -- INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT -- THERE'S ALSO TO BROADWAY'S WE THINK ABOUT MITIGATION TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN IN TERMS OF OPERATING PRACTICES -- AS WE PUT TOGETHER THE WALL FIRE MITIGATION PLANS AND SUBMITTED OUR FIRST ONE THIS YEAR. UNDER THE NEW FORMAT. IT WAS A COMBINATION OF SOMETHING WE FILED LATE LAST YEAR -- OUR GREAT STATE CAN RESULT SEE PLAN AND SO MANY THINGS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN. INTRODUCED IN WHILE FAR MITIGATION PLAN ACTUALLY HAD THEIR START INTEGRATES RESILIENCY PLAN THAT WE SUBMITTED LAST. DECEMBER OR LAST SEPTEMBER. THE REASON I STRESS THAT IS BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A MITIGATION PLAN COMING WE WANT TO GET STARTED EARLY EVEN BEFORE WE FATHER GREAT SAFETY RESERVE IT PLAN WE BEGAN AGGRESSIVELY IN INVESTING IN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND DOING THINGS -- EVEN MORE TO PREVENT AND MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF WILDFIRES. SO SOME OF THESE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT INSULATED CONDUCTORS WE REFER TO THOSE DISCOVER CONDUCTORS LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT THOSE INSULATED CONDUCTORS -- OTHER MEDICATIONS LIKE COMPOSITE POLES AND REMOVED OPERATIONAL PRACTICES WILL TALK ABOUT MANY THINGS WERE DOING THERE AND AND WE REALLY ARE DOING -- MUCH MUCH MORE IN MANY SPACES WE'RE GONNA COME TO THAT VERY QUICKLY AND AND HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO DRESS SOME QUESTIONS AS IT RELATES TO THE START WITH HARDING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. ALREADY WE'VE INSTALLED AROUND A HUNDRED SEVENTY MILES A WHAT WE CALL -- INSULATED CONDUCTORS SO AGAIN WHY DO WE COME TO THIS -- WE LOOKED AT THE CAUSES OF IGNITIONS THAT MAY RESULT FROM OUR SYSTEM. AND AT LEAST HALF OF THEM RESULT FROM CONTACT WITH OUR EQUIPMENT AND MATTER SEARCHES -- VEGETATION BLOWING IN -- MYLAR BALLOONS OTHER THINGS COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT SO THAT'S ONE SOURCE WIRE TO WIRE CONTACT IS ANOTHER AND THEN ACQUITTED FAILURES. BY DRESSING COVER CONDUCTOR OR INSULATED CONDUCTORS WE'VE TARGET ROUGHLY 70% OF THE CAUSES OF IGNITIONS OUR SYSTEM THIS IS A VERY IMPACTFUL AND MEANINGFUL CHANGE. CRIME FOR STRUCTURE WE CAN ABOUT THIS BOTH BY LOOKING AT THE SOURCES OF IGNITIONS AND ALSO BENCHMARKING NOT ONLY HERE IN THE U. S.. BUT OVERSEAS AS WELL TO WHERE THEY HAVE WHILE FIRE ISSUES AND SEEING THAT THIS IS A PRACTICE THAT CAN BE EFFECTIVE. OTHER THINGS WERE DOING AN INFRASTRUCTURE PLACE A SPACE. FUSES SO ANOTHER WAY YOU CAN LIMIT THE THREAD OF SET OF IGNITIONS ON YOUR SYSTEM IS BY MINIMIZING HE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT'S TRANSMITTED. TO FLAMMABLE MATERIAL WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS SO WE DO THIS BY SECTIONAL LIES IN THE SYSTEM CUTTING INTO MORE MORE SMALLER PIECES SO. BOTH WHEN THERE'S AN EVENT ON THE SYSTEM IT REACTS MUCH MORE QUICKLY BUT ALSO SO THAT WHEN THE ENERGY TRANSMITTED INTO THE SYSTEM OR INTO THE GROUND WHEN THERE IS AN EVENT. THE THE ENERGY TRANSFER JUST MUCH LOWER LOWER IGNITION THREAT -- ONE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT ON THE DATA ANALYTICS PIECE -- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS APPLICATIONS TO BOTH PUBLIC SAFETY OUTSIDE A WILDFIRE BUT WITHIN MODIFIERS WELL. WE HAVE DEVELOPED ALGORITHMS WITHIN WHAT WE CALL OUR RELIABILITY OPERATIONS CENTER THAT TARGET DID THE PERTURBATIONS ON THE SYSTEM THAT WE RECEIVE AND SEE FROM OUR SMART METERS. TO METERS THAT HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN USED TO IDENTIFY -- REVENUE REQUIREMENTS OR REVENUE -- MATTERS OVER -- DIFFERENT HOURS. WE'RE ALSO USING THOSE TO TAKE THE VOLTAGE INFORMATION TO COME FROM THOSE. AND IDENTIFY WHEN THERE'S A SITUATION GOING ON OUR SYSTEM AND TAKING PROACTIVE -- STEPS TO DE ENERGIZED AT SO -- WE RECENTLY ESTIMATED THATTO E. I'D ACTUALLY WERE FINALISTS TO FIND THEIR COMPETITION FOR AN EDISON AWARDS SO THIS IS A GROUNDBREAKING TECHNOLOGY THAT WE'RE BRINGING. TO WILDFIRE IN PUBLIC SAFETY. SO SITUATIONAL AWARENESS -- THIS IS SOMETHING WERE ALSO VERY AGGRESSIVELY MOVING FORWARD AND BOTH WEATHER STATIONS. HIGH DEFINITION CAMERAS AND OVERALL PRACTICES AND USE OF DATA WE'VE INVESTED INTO SUPER COMPUTERS TO HELP US WITH COMPLEX WHETHER ANALYTICS -- IN TERMS OF CAMERAS -- WE ALREADY EXPECT TO HAVE AROUND 90% COVERAGE OF A HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR THAT'S A TOTAL A HUNDRED SIXTY CAMERAS. NOW WE HAVE AROUND 6% COVERAGE WITH OVER A HUNDRED CAMERAS ON OUR TERRITORY. REMEMBER THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF OUR OF OUR SERVICE TERRITORY IS EXTREMELY LARGE. 35% OF THAT IS THE FIFTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILES IS HIGH FIRE RISK AREA THESE ARE THE TERRITORIES WERE TARGETING WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT -- WEATHER STATIONS -- BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY WE EXPECT TO HAVE AROUND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY OF THESE DEPLOYED -- WE ALREADY HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED DEPLOYED AND WE'RE TARGETING FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY BY. TWENTY NINETY THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL BECAUSE NOT ONLY DO THEY PROVIDE PROVIDE GROUND LEVEL INFORMATION ON WHAT'S GOING ON ARE CIRCUITS THAT WILL HELP US. MAKE DECISIONS AROUND PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF. THEY ALSO HELP US WITH WEATHER MONITORING BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE EVEN MORE GRANULAR INFORMATION ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN A VERY MICRO LOCATIONS ACROSS OUR SYSTEM SO THIS IS. THIS IS A REAL GAME CHANGER FORCE. WE MOVED OPERATIONAL PRACTICES AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIMENSIONS HERE THAT I REALLY WANT TO POINT OUT. ONE OF THE THINGS WE OBSERVED -- AND WE HAVE HISTORICALLY -- FOCUSED MUCH OF OUR ATTENTION ON COMPLIANCE AND WE'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB COMPLIANCE OVER THE YEARS -- THAT'S BEEN A STANDARD THAT I THINK IT'S HELPED US WE HAVE USE RISK INFORMATION TO HELP GUIDE US THERE. BUT WHAT WE'RE SHIFTING TO NOW IS A PREDOMINATELY A RISK INFORM WAY OF LOOKING AT OUR CIRCUITRY. WHAT THIS LED US TO CONCLUDE THIS YEAR WAS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO GO INTO ANOTHER FIRE SEASON WITHOUT HAVING EYES ON EVERY SQUARE MILE OR EVERY MILE? OF OUR CIRCUITRY SO WITH THAT IN THE END OF DECEMBER WE LAUNCH ENHANCE OVERHEAD INSPECTION PROGRAM WE LOOKED AT AND THIS WAS BY QUALIFIED ELECTRICAL WORKERS. LINEMAN TROUBLE MAN PEOPLE WHO DO THIS FOR A LIVING AND UNDERSTAND HOW THE SYSTEM TO WORK. THEY INSPECTED OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND STRUCTURES AND WE BROUGHT TECHNOLOGY TO BEAR AS WELL WITH THE PORTABLE DEVICES THAT THEY COULD LOG INSPECTED TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS OF INFORMATION ON OUR EVEN MOVING MORE AGGRESSIVELY. WITH AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY WERE USING HELICOPTERS AND DRONES TODAY HIGH DEFINITION IMAGES INFRARED CAMERA SCANS SOMETHING CALLED CORONA IMAGES ALLOW YOU TO SEE FAULTS -- LIKE DETECTING ARRANGING TO HELP US IDENTIFY VEGETATION ENCROACHMENTS ANOTHER DEFECTS OUR SYSTEM ALL THIS IS BEING ANALYZED ANALYSED BY QUALIFIED INSPECTORS AND ALSO WERE USING DIGITAL -- TECHNIQUES TO HELP US WE NEED MORE INFORMATION FROM WHAT WE'RE FINDING ON INSPECTIONS. ALSO IN THE VEGETATION SPACE IN OPERATION PRACTICES BOB I'M NOT GONNA SPEND A LOT OF TIME HERE THIS IS HISTORICALLY BEEN A PLACE OF GREAT EMPHASIS FOR US. BUT ALSO POINT OUT WE'RE MOVING FURTHER AWAY FROM OUR TRIMS OWNS WITH HISTORICALLY DONE DOUBLING THAT RANGE THIS WILL ADD MORE TREES INTO THAT -- INVENTORY ARE ALSO LOOKING AT SOMETHING WE CALLED HAZARD TREES THESE ARE TREES OUTSIDE TYPICAL RIGHT AWAY HE'S. THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE ESCAPED I'LL CALL IT THE THE CHAINSAW. BUT WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE IS TREES THAT MAY ULTIMATELY CAUSE A PROBLEM BLOW INTO OUR SYSTEM FOLLOWING YOUR SYSTEM AND CAUSE A RISK FOR US. STORE MOVING BEYOND TRADITIONAL COMPLIANCE TRIMMING AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS EVEN MORE BROADLY TO THINGS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE TRADITIONAL RIGHT AWAY IMPACTS SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE FEELS CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT. TO REDUCING RISK AND AS PART OF OUR OPERATIONAL PROGRAM [inaudible] SO. MOVING NOW TO US SOMETHING I KNOW -- IT IS -- RIGHTLY GETTING A LOT OF ATTENTION AS PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF -- MANY OF HIS PROGRAMS WE HAVE IN PLACE OR PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE DOING IN THIS SPACE VERY SIMILAR SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC. WE HAVE BENCHMARKED ACROSS UTILITIES INTO WHO'S DOING WHAT AND HOW WE CAN DO THIS BEST -- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS A KEY PART OF WHAT WE ARE VIEWING AS EXTREME EVENT -- ACTIONS THAT WE MAY NEED TO TAKE IN THE EVENT THAT THE WEATHER IS EXTREME AND WE ARE MAKING DECISIONS AROUND PUBLIC SAFETY. THE DECIDED THIS IS REALLY THE BEST BEST OPTION FOR PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR CUSTOMERS -- THIS HAS BEEN PART OF OUR I'LL CALL IT -- TOOL KIT FOR RISK MITIGATION FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW WE ACTUALLY DID THE FIRST ONE OF THESE BELIEVES IN SIGNIFICANTLY UPGRADED POWER APPROACHING IT'S OUR LOOKING AT IT ONE OF THINGS IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM HOW WE'VE DONE THESE HISTORICALLY -- WE NOW LOOK AT EACH INDIVIDUAL CIRCUIT I MENTIONED DATA ANALYTICS SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE'VE LOOKED AT OUR CIRCUITS BEHAVE IN HIGH WIND CONDITIONS. AND SO FOR EACH CIRCUIT WE HAVE A BUT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT CIRCUIT IN HIGH WIND CONDITIONS. THAT'S ONE OF THE DRIVERS WILL ENABLE US TO SAY WHEN WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING. THE ENERGIZING CIRCUIT UNDER EXTREME CONDITIONS -- WE'VE GONE THROUGH A NUMBER OF UPGRADES TO OUR PROGRAM WE TO HAVE INVESTED IN A NEW -- SYSTEM FOR CUSTOMER NOTIFICATIONS THAT CAN PUT OUT -- NORMS AMOUNTS OF NOTIFICATIONS IN A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME TO GET THE WORD OUT VERY QUICKLY -- WE'VE ENGAGED AND DOZENS OF COMMUNITY HEARINGS OF THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT TO EDUCATE OUR COMMUNITIES ABOUT WHAT PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHOTS CAN MEAN TO THEM -- WE HAVE ENGAGED VERY VERY -- EARLY ON AND REGULARLY WHEN OUR FIRST RESPONDERS THERE ARE KEY INPUT BOS INFORMING THE PROGRAM AND ALSO DEVELOPING. RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE WILL NEED TO EXERCISE WHEN WE'RE ANY OF THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL RELY ON INFORMATION FROM OUR FIRST RESPONDERS ON THE GROUND DURING THE EVENT. IS NOT A DECISION THAT -- WE INTEND TO MAKE IT ISOLATION WE LOOK TO OUR ARE -- PARTNERS OF THE COMMISSION AND A CD AND OTHER AREAS IS AN ONGOING PROCEEDING THE HELP CONSTRUCT A FRAMEWORK AROUND THIS THAT WE CAN OPERATE WITHIN. TO MAKE THE VERY TOUGH CHOICES I THINK EVERYBODY UNDERSTANDS AS UTILITIES WE EXIST TO SUPPLY POWER THAT'S OUR THAT'S OUR REAL REASON TO BE SUPPLY RELIABLE AFFORDABLE AND SAFE POWER TO OUR CUSTOMERS. AND SO DE ENERGIZING A CIRCUIT -- IS NOT SOMETHING WE TAKE LIGHTLY AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE BUILDING UP PROGRAMS AND DATA INFORMATION AS WE CAN MAKE THE BEST POSSIBLE DECISION. IN A VERY VERY COMPRESSED TIME SITUATION [inaudible] SO. ONE WHO ARE NEAR CLOSE TO JUST HAVE A COUPLE MORE POINTS TO MAKE HERE BEFORE UP MOVING ON AT ITS CORE THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE AND AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING. IS THE ORGANIZATION S. C. E. WELL TWELVE THOUSAND OVER TWELVE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES WHO ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING WHILE FAR MITIGATION OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. WE HAVE MOBILIZED EVERYBODY ESSENTIALLY THE COMPANY HAS SOME ROLE IN THIS WERE SUPPORTING SOMEONE EITHER BY DIRECTLY OR BACK FILLING FOR WORK THAT HAS BEEN -- CREATED BY DIVERTING RESOURCES INTO THE WHILE FAR MITIGATION PLAN -- WE ARE LOOKING FOR THINK ABOUT THINGS DIFFERENTLY WERE CHALLENGING OUR PLAYERS ARE TEAMS TO LOOK AT THINGS IN NEW AND DIFFERENT WAYS -- WE'VE PARTNERED WITH OUR OUR IBEW LOCAL -- FORTY SEVEN TEAM SAVE A BIT A BILL TO HELP IN HELPING US UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CAPABILITIES ARE CREWS ARE. AND AND BY THE WAY THIS GETS ON WELL BEYOND JUST CREWS IN THE FIELD BUILDING AND INSPECTING THINGS THIS IS ALSO ENGINEERS AND PLANNERS. AND RISK -- RISK EXPERTS AND EXPERTISE ACROSS THE COMPLEX IT'S HELPING US TO COME TO SOME INFORMED AND I'D SAY -- GROUNDBREAKING DECISIONS IN THIS SPACE [inaudible] SO. LOU MAYBE TO CLOSE WHICH IS A COUPLE POINTS HERE. ONE ARE WHAT FOR MITIGATION PLANS THIS IS -- I WE HAVE A TIME LINE HERE -- WE'VE FOCUSED MUCH EFFORT ON THINGS WE CAN DO IMMEDIATELY THIS GETS TO EFFECTIVENESS -- THE ENHANCED OVERHEAD INSPECTIONS WE CAN DO THAT RIGHT AWAY WE'VE DONE THAT TO REDUCE RISK. OUR PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF PROGRAM WE HAVE REVISED OUR PROTOCOL AND HAVE DRILLED ARE TEAMS THAT ARE AYE ANTES ARE READY WHEN THE TIME IS COMING. TO DO THIS AND AN EVEN MORE INFORM WHY THOSE ARE THINGS WE DO RIGHT AWAY WE STARTED IN THE LONGER TERM THINGS COVER CONDUCTOR SO TAKE US SEVERAL YEARS TO DEPLOY ENOUGH COVER CONDUCTOR. THAT WE THINK WILL MAKE A LARGE DIFFERENCE WE'LL SEE BENEFITS RIGHT AWAY WE HAVE A VERY LARGE SYSTEM IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. SOME OF THE OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS THE FUSES WILL BE DONE WITH THAT SOON AND SITUATIONAL AWARENESS WE MOVED AGGRESSIVELY ON THAT SO WE'RE ESSENTIALLY COMPLETE WITH THAT BY -- TWENTY TWENTY WITH MOSTLY INVESTMENT WE WILL BE DOING. BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA STOP THERE I THINK ONE OF THINGS THAT WE ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT -- WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THIS RISK IS EVOLVING? AND THE THREAT OF WILDFIRES IS DRIVEN BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT STABILIZE BY ANY MEANS. WE'RE ALSO LEARNING MORE ABOUT DATA ANALYTICS AND TOOLS WE CAN BRING TO BEAR TERMS OF RISK MITIGATION. WE'RE GONNA CONTINUALLY INVOLVING CHALLENGE OURSELVES WHICH WILL MEAN THIS PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE OF ALL OF OUR TIME THIS IS NOT A STATIC PROGRAM. SO I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE TIME -- TO SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT THIS TODAY LOOKING FOR ANSWERS SOME QUESTIONS I ALSO WANT TO SAY I BAG THANKS FOR THE PARTNERSHIP. AND THE SUPPORT AND I KNOW WILL NEED TO WORK -- TOGETHER COLLECTIVELY -- AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THANK YOU CAN VERY DIFFERENT -- REGIME AND WAY OF THINKING ABOUT OUR SYSTEM -- REALLY RESPONSE TO WELFARE MITIGATION THANK. THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING. GOOD AFTERNOON GERMAN HOLDEN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE. AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THANK YOU FOR SHARED INTEREST AND A VESTED INTEREST. IN THE IMPORTANT. RISKS AND ISSUES WERE ALL FACING A RAID WILDFIRES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO BE -- THE OPERATORS -- BUT IT'S REALLY GONNA TAKE THE COLLECTIVE BOSS -- TO REALLY. HELP FACE THIS UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF RISK FOR OUR CUSTOMERS OUR FRIENDS FAMILIES NEIGHBORS AND OUR COMMUNITIES -- I'M SUMMIT SAYING AND I AND RESPONSIBLE FOR P. GENIES COMMITTEE WHILE FAR SAFETY PROGRAM. IT IS CLEAR TO US THE DEVASTATING TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN WILDFIRES THAT HAPPEN IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY -- HAVE MADE IT OVERWHELMINGLY CLEAR THAT MORE MUST BE DONE TO ADDRESS THIS THREAT WITH A GREAT SENSE OF URGENCY. A AND P. GINNY IS TAKING IMMEDIATE ACTIONS. TO DO THAT -- EXACTLY -- AND A LOT OF WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM MYSELF A LOT OF PARITY -- AND COMMONALITIES BETWEEN WHAT MY PEERS FROM SO CAL OUT OF SAN ANTONIO GAS ELECTRIC HAVE SHARED AS WELL -- BEFORE I TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. SOME OF THE ELEMENTS OF OUR WHILE FAR MITIGATION PLAN -- WANTED TO GIVE CONTEXT IN REGARDS TO THE SCALE OF THE ARE THE RISK IN THE ASSET BASE -- THAT WERE REALLY DEALING WITH -- WITHIN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY -- SO INCLUDED IN. YOUR HANDOUT MATERIALS ON SLIDE -- TO WE OUTLINE. THE OVERHEAD -- DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION MILES THAT WE HAVE THAT TRAVERSE EITHER ELEVATED -- OR EXTREME WILDFIRE RISK. WE'VE GOT A TOTAL OF ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND MILES BETWEEN THE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION. THAT TRAVERSE ELEVATED AND EXTREME QUALIFY RISK IT'S ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR OVER ALL ELECTRIC OVERHEAD SYSTEM. WHEN WE COMPARE THIS TO THE ENTIRE ASSET BASE WITHIN? THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE NEARLY 65% OF OUR DISTRIBUTION OVER HEADLINES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY. THAT ARE PART OF ELEVATED IN EXTREME WILDFIRE RISK. AND FIX SPEND UPON THIS FURTHER -- AND LOOK AT THE NEXT PAGE. IT REALLY PROVIDES. INSIGHTS IN REGARDS -- TO THE THE LAND BASE THAT'S BEEN CHARACTERIZED AS ELEVATED AND EXTREME OFF OUR RISK WE'VE GOT A SERVICE TERRITORY OF SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND SQUARE MILES MORE THAN HALF OF THAT. IS DESIGNATED WITHIN THOSE TWO CLASSIFICATIONS. THAT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND SQUARE MILES OR ROUGHLY 70% OF ALL OF THE HIGH FOR AREAS WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS SUCH DRIVING THAT IS THE AMOUNT OF DENSE VEGETATION -- THAT. EXISTS WITHIN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY -- ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHERN PART OF OUR SERVICE TERRITORY IN THE SIERRA AND THE NORTH VALLEY -- PARTS -- OF OF OUR TERRITORY. SO GIVEN THAT ASSET BASED ON THE SCALE WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT IT FROM A LOT OF FIRE SAFETY PROGRAM. AND THE APPROACH THAT WE'VE TAKEN IS FROM A TIME BASED PERSPECTIVE REALLY FOCUSED ON THE NEAR TERM WHICH ARE THE INITIATIVE HERE AND NOW THE MID TERM AND THE LONG TERM SO THAT WERE CONCURRENTLY. IMPLEMENTING ACROSS A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH -- TO NAVIGATE THE CHALLENGES. REALLY THE THREE PRIMARY AREAS AND PILLARS. THAT ALIGN OUR THE REAL TIME MONITORING AND INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES THE NEW AND ENHANCED SAFETY MEASURES THAT WE'VE. PUT FORWARD AND A CRITICAL HARDENING OF OUR ELECTRIC SYSTEM. I WANT TO TOUCH ON EACH OF THESE IN A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL -- IN REGARDS TO THE REAL TIME MONITORING INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES IN REGARDS TO THE SITUATION AWARENESS CAPABILITIES -- WE ARE DEPLOYING -- A A WEATHER STATION NETWORK TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SIMILAR CAPABILITIES IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING THE LOCAL CLIMATOLOGY SELECT. THAT CAN REALLY HELP INFORM. THE LOCAL WEATHER -- AND THE IMPLICATIONS TO OUR ASSETS SO WE CAN USE THAT TO INFORM ANALYTICS TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WE HAVE. THE GREATEST LEVEL OF RISK ON A CIRCUIT BY CIRCUIT BASIS AND WELL PROCEED WITH THE THE RISK PRODUCTION MEASURE FROM A A PREVENTION -- PERSPECTIVE -- WE'VE GOT ABOUT A PROGRAM OF THIRTEEN HUNDRED WEATHER STATIONS -- THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO INSTALL BY TWENTY TWENTY OR SOONER -- WE'VE INSTALLED NEARLY THREE HEART AND FIFTY STATIONS AND WE HAVE LINE OF SIGHT TO INSTALL SIX OUR STATIONS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR -- IN REGARDS TO OUR HIGH DEFINITION CAMERAS WE'RE WORKING WITH THE THE SAME ENTITIES -- THAT -- OF THE STRONGEST DINO FROM SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC HAD -- OUTLINED WE'VE INSTALLED THIRTY CAMERAS -- SO FAR WE'RE LOOKING TO GET TO A HUNDRED CAMERAS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR -- ON OUR WAY TO GET TO COVERAGE OF ABOUT 90% OF OUR HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS. WITHIN THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS -- IN ADDITION WE STOOD UP A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN WALL FAR SAFETY OPERATIONS CENTER WITHIN OUR HEADQUARTERS IN SOME CISCO TO MONITOR THE POTENTIAL LAW FAR THREAT ACROSS OUR ENTIRE SERVICE AREA IN REAL TIME. AND COORDINATE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE EFFORTS AND THIS WILL STOOD UP. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND ALL OF THE INFORMATION AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WERE DEPLOYING IN REGARDS TO SITUATIONAL AWARENESS CAPABILITIES -- WERE BRINGING ALL OF THAT INFORMATION AND INTELLIGENCE BACK INTO OUR WHILE FAR SAFE SAFETY OPERATIONS CENTER. IN REGARDS TO OUR NEW AND ENHANCED -- SAFETY PROGRAMS ALL TOUCH ON A FEW ELEMENTS. ONE ELEMENT IS REALLY AROUND OUR LAW FOR SAFETY INSPECTIONS PROGRAM -- SO AS MISTER HERRINGTON HAD OUTLINED -- AS WE STARTED TO LOOK AT THE THE PRACTICES THAT WE HAD IN PLACE BOTH FROM AN INSPECTIONS PERSPECTIVE AS WELL AS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT -- THEIR DOORS A RECOGNITION THAT WE NEED TO GO WELL BEYOND THE COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS OF REALLY LOOK AT THIS FROM A RISK INFORMED PLANS -- AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'VE DONE WE LAUNCHED A AGGRESSIVE -- INSPECTION PROGRAM DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHERE WE MOVED FORWARD WITH INSPECTING -- ALL OF OUR TRANSMISSION -- INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS AND WE ARE NEAR COMPLETION OF ARE DOING THE SAME FOR OUR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. THIS REALLY -- ENTAILS A UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF EFFORT W. UNDERTAKEN -- WITHIN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY WE'VE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF INSPECTIONS OF BY A HUNDRED AND 30% FOR TRANSMISSION AND 4100% -- BY DISTRIBUTION -- IN A VERY VERY COMPRESSED TIMELINE -- WE'VE BROUGHT IN A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF QUALIFIED ELECTRICAL WORKERS. AS PART OF A CONTRACT SERVICE PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE TO HELP AID. A AND SUPPORT THE EXECUTION OF THIS WORK IN A SAFE MANNER AND WE'VE ALSO DEPLOYED -- A FLEET OF DRONES -- TO INSPECT ALL OF OUR TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE HI FI RISK AREAS INCLUSIVE OF HELICOPTERS THAT CAPTURE HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGERY -- AND WE HAVE A CENTRALIZED INSPECTION REVIEW TEAM OF QUALIFIED ENGINEERS AND FEEL PERSONNEL THAT REVIEW THE HIGH RESOLUTION IMAGERY THAT COMES IN IN DETAIL. PERFORM A FORENSICS TO IDENTIFY ANY ADVERSE CONDITIONS -- PRIORITIZE CHARACTERIZE THOSE -- AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THE REPAIR WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY. WE ARE ALSO -- IMPLEMENTING ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGY WERE -- WORKING WITH THE SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM SILICON VALLEY TO HELP ENABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING ON THE BACKEND. ON SO THAT WE CAN DEVELOP THE MACHINE LEARNING MODELS SO AS THE IMAGERY IS CAPTURED ON A GO FORWARD BASI WERE ABLE TO USE. MACHINE LEARNING TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL ISSUES. IN A MORE EFFECTIVE -- AND REPEATABLE AND STANDARDIZED WAY -- IN REGARDS TO OUR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. WE'VE -- THIS YEAR DOUBLED. THE SIZE OF OUR PROGRAM -- COMING INTO THIS YEAR -- THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WAS UP ROUGHLY A THREE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WE'VE ACTUALLY MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT -- WE NOT ONLY HAVE A FOCUS ON MAINTAINING THE MINIMUM REQUIRED CLEARANCES AS PRESCRIBED IN THE RESPECTIVE COMPLIANCE REGULATIONS -- IN ADDITION TO FOCUSING ON THE DEAD DYING AND DISEASED TREES AS PART OF A TREE MORTALITY PROGRAM WE'VE ON RAMP TO RISK BASED PROGRAM -- CALLED OUR ENHANCE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND THAT'S REALLY FOCUSED ON REMOVING ALL OF THE OVERHANG -- THAT MAYBE HANGING ON TOP OF OUR OF BARE WIRES EVEN THOUGH -- THERE'S ADEQUATE CLEARANCE -- AS PRESCRIBED IN THE THE COMPLIANCE REGULATIONS. WE HAVE ALSO MOVED FORWARD WITH -- IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERIZING HAZARDOUS TREES AS WE LOOKED AT THE NUMBER AND THE DRIVER OF VEGETATION BECAUSE TECHNICIANS WE IDENTIFIED THAT THERE IS A STRONG CORRELATION. FOR CERTAIN TYPE OF TREES THAT HAVE A HIGHER PROPENSITY OF FALLING IN OR BLOWING INTO OUR LINES THAT MAY BE TALL ENOUGH YET NOT FAR ENOUGH FROM OUR LINES. ON SEWER PROACTIVELY IDENTIFYING THOSE TYPES OF TREE SPECIES -- AND IF THEY HAVE A CERTAIN DE FACT EVEN IF THEY'RE ALIVE AND HEALTHY MOVING FORWARD WITHOUT REMOVING THAT RISK. FROM OUR SYSTEM AND ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE FOCUS AROUND OUR AND HAS VISITATION MANAGEMENT AND THE INSPECTIONS IS WHEN WE ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE DRIVERS FOR THE FIRE IGNITIONS WITHIN P. GINNY SYSTEM. OF VEGETATION MANAGEMENT OR VEGETATION COMING IN CONTACT WITH OUR OVERHEAD SYSTEMS MAKE UP ABOUT 50%. OF THE IGNITION DRIVERS AND EQUIPMENT. RELATED ISSUES IS ANOTHER 25% -- AND THE BALANCE OF THE 25% IS PROBABLY AROUND THIRD PARTY -- ANIMAL CONTACT OR A ABOVE A VEHICLE FOR EXAMPLE COMING IN CONTACT WITH OUR SYSTEM. ANOTHER ELEMENT VERY SIMILAR. TO WHEN MR -- HERRINGTON OUTLINE FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON MORE FUNDAMENTALLY REDESIGNING. OUR ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM -- AND THAT'S REALLY PART OF OUR LONGER TERM SYSTEM HARDENING AND PRESIDENCY STRATEGY WE'RE NOT WAITING WE'VE -- ALREADY MOVED TO ACTION ON THAT WE'VE GOT ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE MILES COMPLETED BETWEEN. THE LAST QUARTER OF LAST YEAR AS WELL AS THE WORK WE'VE DONE TO THIS YEAR. AND WE LOOK TO GET. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES COMPLETED BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND START TO MOVE TO ABOUT SIX HUNDRED MILES. PER YEAR BEGINNING NEXT YEAR AND SOME OF THE EXAMPLES ON A FUNDAMENTAL REDESIGN IS WERE -- EVALUATING -- OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO ELIMINATE THE RISK -- BY REMOVING THE OVERHEAD ELECTRICAL LINES IN SOME CASES WE'VE GOT A FIVE AND A HALF TO SIX MILE LINE THAT'S TRAVERSING. A HEAVY DANCE AND FOREST AREA THIS PROVIDING SERVICE TO RAILWAY SIGNAL -- THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO PROVIDE SERVICE -- TO THAT -- RESPECTIVE ENTITY AN INDIVIDUAL FROM A SOLAR AND A BATTERY BACK UP AS AN EXAMPLE SO. HOSPITAL OF THE NATION IS ONE PART OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT FOR SYSTEM HARDENING. ANOTHER DIMENSION ABOUT SYSTEM HARDING IS -- LOOKING AT TARGETED UNDER GROUNDING. SPECIFICALLY AROUND A COMMUNITIES THAT MAY HAVE. SIGNIFICANT ADDRESS CHALLENGES AND WE'RE WE HAVE OUR POLL LINES -- THAT TRAVERSE. ON OVERHEAD BASIS ALONG THOSE EGRESS ACCESS IS THOSE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US. TO PROACTIVELY UNDERGROUND AS PART OF SYSTEM HARDENING -- AND THEN THE LAST IN A KINDA ELEMENT AROUND SYSTEM PARTING IS VERY SIMILAR AROUND -- IMPLEMENTING COVERED CONDUCTORS AND TRANSITIONING AWAY FROM THE WHAT POLLS TO MORE OF OF THE COMPOSITE BASED POLLS. THE LAST ITEM I'D LIKE TO TOUCH ON IS THE PRODUCT OF THE LEGISLATION AROUND THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF. WE BENCHMARK HEAVILY AND AND LEANED UP SIGNIFICANTLY. TO OUR PEERS IN THE SOUTH THAT HAVE HAD THIS PRACTICE IN PLACE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND WE'VE UNEMPLOYED -- MANY OF THOSE POLICIES AND PRACTICES WE IMPLEMENTED OUR FIRST PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF PROGRAM LAST YEAR -- THIS YEAR WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED IT TO INCLUDE NOT JUST THE EXTREME FAR RISK AREAS BUT ALSO THE ELEVATED FIRE RISK AREAS -- AND WE'RE ALSO INCLUDING A TRANSMISSION OUR SYSTEM IN OUR RISK EVALUATION AND DETERMINATION FROM A PROACTIVE -- DE RESERVATION PERSPECTIVE. RIGHT VERY MINDFUL OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THAT THIS COULD CAUSE FROM A PUBLIC SAFETY PERSPECTIVE WHEN WE DO DE ENERGIZED. US WE'VE GOT THE A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH ON MEDICATION -- AS IT PERTAINS TO THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT GREAT BASED SOLUTIONS WERE WE ARE PROACTIVELY IMPLEMENTING -- GENERATION -- POINTS AND BACKUP GENERATION POINTS MOBILE GENERATION POINTS ON A GRID SYSTEM ITSELF TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN. SOME OF THE CRITICAL ESSENTIAL SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED WITHIN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITY -- WE'RE DOING APALETTE CURRENTLY WITH THE PACIFIC UNION COLLEGE UP AND AND WHEN IN THE NAPA COUNTY -- AND WE'RE GONNA BE USING THAT AS A BLUEPRINT FOR THEIR EXPAND THAT CAPABILITY GOING FORWARD IN TERMS OF THE GREAT BAY SOLUTION. THE OTHER THING WE'RE DOING IS WE ARE FURTHER SEGMENTING OUR DISTRIBUTION -- CIRCUIT SO THAT WE CAN BE MUCH MORE TARGETED -- INSTALLING THE WEATHER STATIONS AT THE GRANULAR LEVEL WHEN WE DO DE ENERGIZED SO WE'RE NOT IMPACTING A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT OF A DEACTIVATION OF ACT. THE SECOND PART OF THE STRATEGY IS REALLY A COMMUNITY BASED SOLUTION -- SO WE'RE LOOKING AT COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS WE HAVE MORE THAN FIFTY LOCATIONS IDENTIFIED. NOT ACROSS THE TWENTY SEVEN DIFFERENT COUNTIES -- AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WRAP THAT UP AND ENGAGE WITH A LOCAL OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES TO MOVE. TO MORE OF A PERMANENT TYPE OF A FACILITY IN COORDINATION IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM -- FROM A A BACKUP GENERATION PERSPECTIVE FOR THE COMMUNITY -- CAN AGGREGATE WE CAN PROVIDE CHARGE SERVICES BASIC NEEDS A NECESSITY CENTERS WATER SERVICES AND INFORMATION IN REGARDS TO THE EVENT ITSELF. AND THEN THE THE LAST ITEM THAT WE'RE BASICALLY FOCUSED ON A IS REALLY A CUSTOMER BASE SOLUTION AND WE'RE REALLY ENABLING -- THE GENERATION MARKETS WERE MAKING IT EASIER FOR OUR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS -- TO INTERFACE WITH THE VENDORS THAT PROVIDE TURNKEY SERVICES FOR BACKUP GENERATION SO THEY CAN HAVE. APPROPRIATE ACCESS TO ENTITIES LIKE HOME DEPOT AND AND AND OTHERS THAT BASICALLY INSTALLED -- THE GENERATORS AND ALSO PROVIDE THE GENERATORS THEMSELVES NOT MORE SPECIFICALLY IN REGARDS -- TO BE AT THE RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND THE THE MEDICAL BAY FIND CUSTOMERS. WE ARE REALLY. LOOKING AT AND AND CURRENTLY PARTNERING UP WITH A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS THE CALIFORNIA FOUNDATION OF INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS -- AND LOOKING TO ESTABLISH A GRANT BASED PROGRAM WHERE WE CAN ALLOCATE FUNDING. TO MAKE THE BACKUP GENERATION -- MORE COST COMPETITIVE A MORE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE. FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS. I AND IN CONCLUSION SINCE WE FILED THE BALL FORCE IF YOU PLAN IN FEBRUARY. WE HAVE BEEN PROVIDING UPDATES TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION IN REGARDS TO OUR PROGRESS -- BUT SOME OF THE THE BARRIERS WHICH NOW I KNOW THE OTHER COMMITTEE WAS INTERESTED -- IN IN LEARNING ABOUT WE WE HAVE -- AS I MENTIONED BEFORE -- BE A COMPLETELY -- TURN THE THE LABOR MARKET FOR OUR LINE CLEARANCE QUALIFIED WORKERS IN OUR LINE MAN -- UPSIDE DOWN GIVEN THE THE VOLUME OF WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WITH BROUGHT IN MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND CONTRACT RESOURCES. WE HAVE DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF QUALIFY TREE WORKERS THAT WE HAVE -- THIS TIME LAST YEAR WE HAD FIFTEEN HUNDRED WORKERS WERE NEARLY THREE THOUSAND WORKERS -- AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES ON HOW BEST. WE CAN BRING IN AND CONTINUE TO BRING IN ADDITIONAL QUALIFIED RESOURCES TO DO -- THE THE LEVEL OF WORK THAT'S NEEDED TO REDUCE RISK ON THE SYSTEM AND DO IT IN A SAFE MANNER. AND WITH THAT WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE COMMITTEE AND CHAIRMAN FOR YOURSELF FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. WITH THANK YOU AND I DO APPRECIATE YOU ALL BEING HERE AND ARE GIVING US -- MORE INTIMATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE WALL FAR MANAGEMENT PLAN WELL FAR MANAGEMENT PLAN THAT YOU PRESENTED TO THE CPUC AND TO GIVE US A CHANCE TO SORT OF ASK QUESTIONS AND WERE YOU PRIORITIZED. MANY OF THESE APPROACHES I I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS I'D LIKE TO RAISE -- JUST TO GET US STARTED -- MR HERRINGTON -- THERE ARE REPRESENT THE AREA ABOUT TO DO YOU KNOW WHICH IS A FOOT -- COMMUNITY. THE BASE OF ANGELES FOREST AND YOU TALK ABOUT THEY HAVE HAD AND WE HAD A COMMUNITY HEARING. OF SOME CONCERN ABOUT SORT OF THE THE CRESTS OF THREE TRIMMING THAT'S TAKING PLACE IN THAT AREA. AND I GUESS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE IS WHAT EFFORT IS -- EDISON TAKING TO SERVE DO A BETTER JOB OF INTEGRATING WITH THE COMMUNITY LETTING THEM KNOW WHAT YOUR PLANS ARE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW. JUST KNOW THAT AN AREA OF ALTADENA -- I HAVE ARBORS. ISRAEL ARBORIST THAT LIVE IN THAT AREA AND THEY WERE THE FIRST TO CALL TO SAY. EXCUSE ME THE DEGREE OF CUTTING IN EXCESS OF NATURE OF THE CUTTING OF THE TREES -- BECAUSE GREAT ALARM TO THEM SO. HOW DO WE START TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE COMMUNITY AS YOU'D? MAYBE RIGHTFULLY LOOK AT EXPANDING YOUR OF YOUR TRIMMING AREA SO THAT THERE'S A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE REASONS WHY AND THE METHOD THAT YOU'RE USING -- TO TRIM BACK THE TREES SURE BOB THANK YOU JERROLD AYE THAT WAS A THAT HEARING AS WELL SO I KEENLY APPRECIATED I ALSO LIVE IN THE AREA SO I KNOW THAT -- THE TREES ARE BELOVED THERE AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT SO. I I BUT YOU'VE HIGHLIGHTED A KEY POINT FOR US I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE FOCUSED ON A SINCE AND EVEN BEFORE THAT I THINK PART OF THIS IS GETTING THE WORD OUT. OF MORE COMMUNITY HEARINGS AND MORE COMMUNITY OUT REACH TO EDUCATE THE COMMUNITY IN THE WHY AND THE THE WHAT WE'RE DOING -- WE'VE ALSO REFINED I'LL CALL IT OUR ESCALATION PROCESS OUR PROCESS FOR NOTIFICATION AND AND pAND AND DISCUSSION AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH -- WITH ANY KIND OF TRIM ACTIVITY -- A COUPLE OF POINTS I DO WANT TO SAY THAT THE THE THE THE FOLKS FROM OUR TEAM WHO DO THE LISTING AND IDENTIFICATION OR ALSO QUALIFIED ARBORIST SO -- THEY EVEN THOUGH THEIR JOB IS TO TRIM TREES -- THEY THEY HAVE A PASSION FOR TREES AS WELL -- BUT WE UNDERSTAND THIS IS A SENSITIVE ISSUE AND IT'S PART OF THE BALANCE THAT WE ARE ARE TRYING TO COME TO AS WE LOOK -- TO WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITIES -- TO TO TO HAVE THEM BRING THEM ALONG AND FRANKLY THIS -- THIS PROCESS WE'RE MOVING FORWARD WITH TO REDUCE RISK BUT MORE COMMUNITY OUTREACH WE'VE UPGRADED OUR NOTIFICATION PROCESS IS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITIES. AND SOLICIT FEEDBACK SO WE CAN EDUCATE THEM I I THINK PART OF THIS -- IS IS THE FACT THAT WE ARE DOING THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND MORE EXTENSIVELY AND AND CANDIDLY MORE AGGRESSIVELY BECAUSE OF THE RISK. I THINK THE SHARP EDGE OF THAT IS THAT -- SOME FOLKS HAVEN'T SEEN THAT BEFORE AND MAY NOT UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE FOR DOING THAT AND THAT'S WERE FOCUSING OUR EFFORTS. I THINK THAT'S FAIR -- BUT I AND I I LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS TO IN A A MAJOR ISSUE IN THE AREA AND I'M ASSUMING THAT OTHER COMMUNITIES -- BORDER FOR HILL -- OR FORCED ERRORS THE INTERFACE ARE PROBABLY GOING TO HEAR SIMILAR CONCERNS FROM. OF THE OTHER -- TERRITORY REPRESENTATIVES ON THE DISCUSSION KIND OF THIS FOR ALL OF YOU TO TO SORT OF THINK ABOUT ERICA RESPOND -- TO AND THIS IS REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND -- ON THE ENERGY IS A SEND WHAT YOUR BACKUP. STRATEGIES ARE AS IT RELATES TO POWER AND HOW YOU WOULD PROVIDE THAT I KNOW STORAGE IS ONE OF THE OPTIONS BUT CLEARLY YOU CAN HAVE STORAGE IN EVERY. GARAGE -- AND THEN OF COURSE AS YOU LOOK AT MICHAEL GRADES MICHAEL GRADES ARE CERTAINLY. A APPROACH THAT -- HAS SOME VIABILITY BUT UNLESS YOU'RE UNDERGROUND IN THE LINES. THEY WOULD BE IMPACTED BY THE ENERGIZING AS WELL. AND THEN OF COURSE THE ULTIMATE COST TO THE RATE PAYERS. HOW DO YOU KIND OF CLARIFY THESE ISSUES AND AND HOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT MOVING FO TO PROVIDE A -- A STRATEGY. FOR BACK UP WHERE APPROPRIATE -- WHEN YOU DE ENERGIZED IN CERTAIN AREAS? MAYBE I CAN -- BILL OFFER COUPLE THINGS IN MY COLLEAGUES HERE HAVE VIEWS -- AND AND WE WITH A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME OR SOME OF THE THINGS THAT -- AND IS IT IS WORKING ON THAT -- WE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO SHARE YET SO. I I IT IT PARALLELS MANY OF THE RESPONSES AND AND AND PLANS AND AND PROTOCOLS WERE PUTTING INTO PLACE. FIRST AND FOREMOST CAM THIS IS A THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE WHICH IS WHY WE'RE EVEN HAVING A CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW SO -- THE THE DECISION TO DO IS NOT MADE LIGHTLY SO PART OF IT I CAN ONLY STARTS WITH HOW DO WE FIND WAYS TO REDUCE THE OVERALL FOOTPRINT. OF OF THE SPS A VENT AND FOR US THAT'S DESIGNING CIRCUIT LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY SO WE DON'T HAVE A BLANKET LEVEL IN EACH EACH ZONE WHERE WE DE ENERGIZED. WE UNDERSTAND EACH INDIVIDUALS CIRCUIT WHERE WE EXPECT TO SEE -- POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND THAT FORMS THE THRESHOLD SO THAT'S ONE WAY OF MINIMIZING FOOTPRINT. ADDITIONAL SEXUALIZED IN WHICH MR SINGH MENTION HERE -- AGAIN OTHER WAYS TO REDUCE THIS AND THEN LASTLY GREATER INFORMATION FROM THE WEATHER STATIONS FROM OTHER PREDICTIVE CAPABILITIES TO HELP US HONE IN ON WHEN WE REALLY THINK WE WILL NEED TO DO THIS. THROUGH THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE FOR ONE OF THESE IS -- WE DO PRE -- PREVENT PATROLS WHICH AGAIN IDENTIFY SHOULD WE DO WANT OTHER PROBLEMS ON THE LINE TO MAKE US MORE BUYS. TWO OF THE REASONS WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THIS THIS HELPS US UNDERSTAND WHEN TO DO IT AND WHEN NOT TO DO IT. AND ON THE GROUND RESOURCES WE WILL HAVE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND OVER MAKING THESE DECISIONS TO ADVISE SO THIS IS AGAIN MINIMIZING THE FOOTPRINT. WHEN THEY HAPPEN -- WE DO -- IN CASES WE LOOK TO OUR AS OUR MERGED THE SERVICE PROVIDERS -- CERTAIN CLASSES OF CUSTOMERS WHERE WE ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT PROVIDING BACKUP GENERATION SO THAT'S ONE ELEMENT OF IT -- ANOTHER ELEMENT OF IT IS WE ALSO HAVE PILOT PROGRAMS WERE PILING WHICH PROBABLY WITH A HIGH SCHOOL IN SOUR JOAQUIN A IT'S NOT -- IT'S ALMOST A MICRO GOOD IT'S A BACK IT'S A STORAGE CELLAR COMBINATION OF THAT WE HAVE A RESILIENCY CENTER IF YOU WELL. BASED ON BATTERY TECHNOLOGIES SOLAR TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD WITHSTAND -- A PROLONGED PS BECAUSE OF THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO REPLICATE MORE OF THAT. WE ALSO ARE USING MOBILE TRAILERS THAT HAVE CHARGING STATIONS THAT WE BOTH -- BOTH MY COLLEAGUES HERE IS TO APPLY PROVIDING PLACES TOGETHER -- I REALLY TO POINT OUT ONE OTHER THING IN THIS IS. WHERE WE PARTNER WITH -- YES -- ON EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS URGENCY SIR THANK YOU OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES GALLO YES CALOR OFF TO MERGE THE SERVICES -- WHO WILL HELP US? GET THE WORD OUT ABOUT COMMUNITY RESILIENCY BECAUSE ONE OF THINGS THAT -- WE WE OFTEN FORGET IS THERE ARE OTHER REASONS THAT YOU MAY LOSE POWER FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME -- CATASTROPHIC EVENTS SUCH AS AN EARTHQUAKE -- OTHER KIND OF SYSTEM DISRUPTIONS. SO WHAT WE WE WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO EDUCATE THE CUSTOMER THE COMMUNITY ABOUT RESILIENCY AND BECOMING PREPARED FOR OTHER THINGS THAT MIGHT HAPPEN SO THERE'S MULTIPLE PRONGS TO THIS. ABOUT HIS CLOTHES WITH THIS IS ALSO SOMETHING WERE INVOLVING -- TO LEARN MORE ABOUT AND MAYBE THE LAST THING I'LL SAY IS ULTIMATELY THE SYSTEM HARDING THAT WE DO. WILL BRIDGES TO A TIME WHEN THESE ARE LESS AND LESS LIKELY THE MORE YOUR SYSTEM'S HARDENED AND IS LESS LIKELY TO BE -- IMPACTED BY CONDITIONS WHICH CAUSES TO DO PS PS THE LOTS OF THESE WILL HAVE MET PROBABLY IN THE SHRINKING THE FOOTPRINT. THE THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD TO THAT -- IN THAT -- COVERED WALLS -- FILL FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THE OTHER AVENUE FROM A EDUCATION AWARENESS PERSPECTIVE IS OF THE LAW THE CRITICAL ESSENTIAL CUSTOMERS SO AND SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO THE COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF HOSPITALS. FROM THE WATER AGENCIES WASTE WATER AGENCIES -- FROM EDUCATION AND AND PREPAREDNESS PERSPECTIVE THAT THERE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS THAT REQUIRE THEM TO ALSO HAVE BACKUP GENERATION SO. YOU KNOW HAVING THAT HEIGHTENED AWARENESS -- THAT THIS IS A REALITY -- GIVEN THE EXTREME NATURE OF THE WILD FIRE RISK ON THE CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT WE'RE FACING WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- KIND OF A BRIDGE SOLUTION IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT RIGHT IN TERMS OF THE PROACTIVE THE LEGISLATION. IS SOMETHING WE DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THAT COMPLETELY GOES AWAY BUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF EXERCISING IT. REDUCES AS WE CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN REGARDS TO THE IN HAS VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS THE SYSTEM HARD BANG -- WERE ALSO -- PILOTING -- INTENTIONAL TECHNOLOGY THAT'S AFTER COMING OUT OF THE STATE OF VICTORIA IN AUSTRALIA. THAT HAS HAD SOME VERY SIMILAR ISSUES CALLED -- THE RAPID EARTH FAULT CURRENT LIMITER AND REALLY THE UNDERLYING PREMISE OF THAT. TECHNOLOGY IS TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY. THAT FLOWS THROUGH THE THE ACTUAL -- THE CONDUCTOR OR BARE WIRE -- AND WHEN IT DOES SUFFER -- IT ACTUALLY -- REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO THE POINT WHERE IT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO CREATE A FIRE IGNITION EVENT -- AND THEY'VE ACTUALLY SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED IT -- AND PROVEN IT -- IN SUCH A BECOME PART OF THEIR LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENT WITHIN THE STATE OF VICTORIA -- AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT -- WE'RE CURRENTLY PILOTING AND UP LOOKING TO ACTIVELY PURSUE AS WELL. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN SAN DIEGO IN ADDITION TO THIS SUCH AS AS COVERED IT REALLY WELL I DON'T THINK WE FOUND THE SAME SOLUTION IT'S IT'S ALMOST THERE'S BEEN UNIQUE. IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THIS KIND OF MITIGATION STRATEGY FOR DIFFERENT SOLUTION SOME EXAMPLES ONE OF OUR TRIBAL NATIONS YOU KNOW WE'VE WORKED WITH THEM THEY SAID WE REALLY NEED. THIS AREA TO REMAIN ENERGIZED SO WE WORKED WITH THE TRIBE IN WHEN AND CLEARED ALL THE VEGETATION UNDER PARTICULAR LINES WE STATION A CONTRACT FIREFIGHTING RESOURCES THERE AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SERVE THAT -- COMMUNITY THAT WAY ANOTHER ONE WE'RE LOOKING AT YOU KNOW MORE THE TRADITIONAL CAN WE PUT A BATTERY WALL AND SOLAR PANELS AT THOSE COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTERS AND KEEP THOSE GOING. THERE ARE SOME OTHER PLACES WHERE IT MAKES SENSE FOR US TO DO SOME SHORT SPANS OF STRATEGIC UNDERGROUND ACT. AND THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO ENABLE US TO KEEP A DOWNTOWN AREA ENERGIZED BUT I THE POINT BEING IS THAT A LOT OF WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT. WHAT WORKS FOR ONE COMMUNITY MIGHT BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN ANOTHER BUT WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY WE CAN WORK TOWARDS THESE SOLUTIONS AND IT IT DOES BECOME A COMMUNITY? BASED SOLUTION. I APPRECIATE THAT [inaudible] DOCTOR EGGMAN. THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I REMEMBER YOUR JOBS I WANNA BE MINE EITHER AND FOR YEARS -- KIND OF THREE GENERAL QUESTIONS IN A AND I THINK YOU'VE YOU'VE SOMEWHAT ADDRESS THEM IN THE ISSUE OF DECREASING POWER SHUTTING IT DOWN. IS MICROBE GRADES A BETTER WAY TO GO WITH BACKUP BATTERY AND DO WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO KIND OF PATCHWORK AROUND THE STATE. SOME PLACES THAT ARE MIGRATED WERE AND THEN BE ABLE TO GET THE SYSTEM BACK UP IN A TIMELY FASHION BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN THE CONCERN. UP. HERE THE QUESTIONS AROUND. THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF HARDENING ALL THE LINES VERSES UNDER GROUNDING EVERYTHING THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT UNDER GRANTING I KNOW THERE'S SOME THINGS ARE COST PROHIBITIVE BUT IS THAT ALSO LIKE YOU'VE SAID. IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE THERE'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS. AND THEN AS WE'RE STILL GOING TO THE NINE A ONE PROCESS AT ALL OF THAT IS COMING IN. THE PLANS ARE COMING IN. YOU KNOW WHAT IF WHAT IF DIFFERENT. THINGS ARE FOUND AFTER NINE A ONE AND THEN WHAT WILL BE YOUR UPDATING PROCESS AS WE GO FORWARD WITH THAT. DO YOU WANT TO START GRABBED THE GO AHEAD OKAY. IT WOULDN'T WHEN WE LOOK AT LARGE SCALE DEPLOYMENT OF MICROGRAMS WE WE HAVE ULTIMATELY LOOKED AT THOSE AS A TOOL FOR FOR RESILIENCE -- BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING RIGHT NOW THAT IS BEING. DEPLOYED ON A ON A WIDE SCALE -- TYPE OF FEATURE ACROSS SAN DIEGO WE FIND MORE RIGHT NOW IT'S BY A PARTICULAR RESIDENTS WERE LOOKING AT IT AND WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO FIND ITS PLACE IN THE RESILIENCE PORTFOLIO BUT RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT. GOING INTO A LARGE SCALE -- DEPLOYMENT. IN TERMS BECAUSE IT JUST COST OR PRACTICALITY WON'T PART OF IT THAT THE CHAIR MENTIONED IT EARLIER IS THAT MICROGRAMS REQUIRE IT TO TRULY BE FULLY RESILIENT AN UNDERGROUND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ALONG WITH IT. SO THERE ARE SOME -- INHIBITING FACTORS IF IT WENT WHEN YOU REALLY START TO TO LOOK AT ITS ITS APPLICATION IS A FIRE RESILIENCE TOOL -- BUT WE WE DO THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME PLACES WHERE IT IT DOES HAVE ITS PLACE IN THAT RESILIENCE PORTFOLIO -- WHEN WE LOOK AT HARDENING? ARMED FORCES UNDER GROUNDING -- IT'S THERE THERE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT COST -- COST. PROFILES -- WERE UNDER GROUNDING IS EXTENSIVELY MORE -- COST PROHIBITIVE IN SOME CASES AND PART OF THE THE REASON IS THAT. YOU COULD REPLACE A LINE BUT TO UNDERGROUND YOU MAY HAVE TO FOLLOW A ROAD SYSTEM IT MAY TAKE. FAR MORE UNDER GROUNDING TO REPLACE IT THAN JUST FOLLOWING THE PATH OF THE CURRENT OVERHEAD WHICH CAN MAKE IT TANA VASTLY MORE EXPENSIVE -- AND THEN IN TERMS OF NINE OH ONE THERE'S A CONTINUOUS EVOLUTION OF THIS PRO OF OUR FIRE MITIGATION PROGRAM THERE HAS BEEN FOR A DECADE IN THERE WILL BE. NINE OH ONE THIS IS A GUIDE YOU KNOW IT GUIDES DOWN I RIGHTS WHAT WE'RE PLANNING TO DO BUT THAT BEING SAID AS TECHNOLOGY EVOLVES -- WE CONTINUE TO EVOLVE WITH IT AND WILL CAPTURE EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING IN THESE PLANS BUT IT WOULD NEVER PREVENT US FROM EVOLVING OR INTEGRATING THE NEXT TECHNOLOGY. FIVE PEOPLE JUST ALONG TO THAT -- TO IN IN TERMS OF MY PROGRESS I THINK THERE'S ALSO THE ELEMENT FROM A BATTERY STORAGE -- ENABLEMENT PERSPECTIVE OF SPECIAL WE START THINKING ABOUT THE DURATION OF THE POTENTIAL DEALER DOES ATION EVENTS SOME OF THESE. ABOUT FLOOD WARNINGS ARE THE CONDITIONS CAN LAST TWENTY FOUR THIRTY SIX HOURS AND BUT AFTER THAT CONDITION HAS PASSED ON THE SYSTEM -- BUT WE WE CAN'T JUST GO IN AND RE ENERGIZE WE INSURE THAT WE DO THE SAFETY INSPECTIONS. ON ALL OF OUR DE ENERGIZED LINES TO IDENTIFY ANY POTENTIAL IMPACT THAT MAY HAVE OCCURRED SO WE INSPECT EVERY INCH OF THE LINE THAT WAS -- IMPACTED FROM AUDIENCES ATION PERSPECTIVE EITHER LEVERAGING AERIAL FLEET OR QUALIFIED -- GROUND PERSONNEL SO IN SOME CASES WE CAN HAVE AN EVENT. THAT MAY LAST MULTIPLE DAYS THREE FOUR FIVE DAYS AND I THINK FROM MY MY VANTAGE POINT YOU KNOW THE AN ABLE MAN DOWN THE CAPABILITY OF THE STORAGE MARKET YOU KNOW IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT CONTINUES. TO EVOLVE FROM A TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT PERSPECTIVE -- BUT IF I JUST BUILD ON STREET DAY AUGUSTINE'S POINT REGARDING SYSTEM HARDENING AN UNDERGROUND. THE DIMENSION THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT THIS FROM. VERY CONSISTENT -- AS WELL AS OUTLINED. BUT NOT JUST AT THE COST PIECE IS ALSO A PACE PIECE OF THIS -- IN TERMS OF DOING UNDER GROUNDING TAKES MUCH LONGER AND THEN THE VIEW POINT THAT WE HAVE ON THIS IS -- TO THE LONGER SOME MEDICATIONS TAKE THE LONGER THE WRIST EXPOSURES OUT THERE RIGHT SO -- THAT THAT'S YOU KNOW BUT ONE A DIMENSION OF THIS AS WELL AND AND WE DO HAVE UNDER GROUNDING. AS A STRATEGIC. INITIATIVE IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT AS PART OF THE THE SUITE OF SYSTEM -- HARDENING OF RENDON RESILIENCY PROCESS OVERALL. BECAUSE UNDER GROUNDING ALSO IS NOT. FREE FROM A RISK PERSPECTIVE YES IT COMPLETELY YOU KNOW REDUCES FOR THE MOST PART THE WILD FIRE RISK BUT THERE'S OTHER ELEVATED RISK THAT HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED IN TERMS OF IMPACT AS A RESULT OF POTENTIAL LANDSLIDE. DICK AND SUSCEPTIBILITY. TO MODEL REPAIR TIME IT TAKES WHEN THERE'S AN IMPACT TO UNDERGROUND LINE ALSO THERE'S A SET OF ELEVATED. OF RISK FACTORS THAT HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. AND THEN IN REGARDS TO THE UPDATE FOR THE SB NOT A ONE WE'RE GONNA BE FILING. A LOT FOR MEDICATION PLAN ON ANNUAL BASIS -- AND IN THE PLAN OUTLINES. YOU KNOW KIND OF THE THE THE FLOOR FROM MY PERSPECTIVE ON YOU KNOW ALL THE THINGS THAT WE'VE ACTUALLY PUT FORWARD -- BUT IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT COMES ALONG DURING THAT ONE YEAR TIME FRAME THE ONLY FULLY ANTICIPATE -- TO IMPLEMENT AND LEVERAGE THAT AND THEN MAKE THAT UPDATE -- AS AT THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY WITHIN THE BY THE TORY FALLING PROCESS. THANKS TO I'M GONNA GET A COLLEAGUES HAD MOST OF IT HERE -- AND I JUST A COUPLE OF EXTRA POINTS -- THE GROWTH THINKING ABOUT MICHAEL GOODS AND A GREAT AND A GROUNDING IN A SIMILAR CONTEXT WHICH IS THEIR APPLICATIONS WHERE THAT IS A GOOD SOLUTION BOTH PARKER GRADES IN UNDERGROUND AND APPLICATIONS WHERE IT'S NOT SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS IS WHAT FITS BEST FOR THE THE PARTICULAR APPLICATION. AGAIN I THINK FOR US THE UNDERGROUND AND ONE OF THEM IS -- MISTER SING AT THE IS THE TIME IT ACTUALLY TAKES TO TO DO THIS DEPLOYMENT ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE FOCUSING ON COVER CONDUCTOR IS TO REALLY THE RAPID REPEATEDLY WHICH WE CAN DEPLOY THE SOLUTION. AND GET MUCH OF THE BENEFIT OF UNDERGROUND IN WITH A COVERING NOT NOT ALL THAT MUCH OF IT SO -- THE YOU KNOW THOSE ARE THINGS WE THINK THROUGH UNDERGROUND AND WE WILL DO UNDER GROUNDING IS A RELATES TO WALL FIRE MITIGATION IS HE'S IS WHERE IT HAS A RIGHT APPLICATION -- THE POINT I WOULD ALSO CLOSE ON A CONTINUOUS AMOUNT OF CHANGE THAT WE EXPECT TO SEE BOB EVEN YEAR ON YEAR. WE'RE SEEING NEW TECHNOLOGIES EMERGE THE A FREQUENTLY NOW ONES THAT HAVE A DIRECT APPLICATION. ONE OF THE BIG ONES IS HOW ARE USING DATA ANALYTICS IN MACHINE LEARNING. THEY THEY EVEN CAN FIND THEIR WAY INTO SOME OF THE MORE BASIC THINGS WERE DOING TERMS OF LOCATING COVER CONDUCTOR AND WORDS BASS AS WE GET MORE AND MORE. INFORMATION ALLOWS US TO PRIORITIZE OR THE NEXT BEST MILE IS THAT REALLY HELPS TO INFORM US AND MANY SURE THAT WERE REDUCING RISK AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. SO YOU'LL SEE THAT YOU'LL SEE THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES A RAPID EARTH FALL LIMITERS -- OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT THAT ALTERNATELY WILL HELP US TO AN EVEN BETTER JOB ONCE IT BUT WE'RE PROBABLY NOT ENVISIONING RIGHT NOW BUT IN TWO OR THREE YEARS. DEL MARCH AND WE WANT TO PULL THOSE IN OUR PLAN -- THAT'S THAT'S PART OF OUR PROGRAM AND HOW WE'RE LOOKING AT IT. I THINK IN JUST TWO QUICK THINGS. ONE I MEAN AS WE KNOW IT'S RAINING AGAIN RIGHT SO WE KNOW WILDFIRE SEASON IS GOING TO BE. IT'S GONNA BE ANOTHER BAD ONE I MEAN. AND THIS IS A SOMEONE A RHETORICAL QUESTION BUT HOW DO WE TRUST THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE. CONTINUING TO MAINTAIN CONTINUING TO GO BACK I MEAN. FOR THE SCIENTIFIC PROCESS RIGHT WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WHAT'S THE ANALYSIS WHAT'S THE AMP IMPLEMENTATION AND WHAT'S THE ONGOING EVALUATION. HOW DO YOU HOW TO CONVINCE US IN THE PUBLIC? THAT THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN. AND ENDED BY LAST QUESTION AS AN ASIDE WERE YOU GETTING ALL THESE WORKERS ARE LET'S TALK ABOUT LABOR SHORTAGE IN GOING FROM SIXTEEN HUNDRED ALMOST THREE THOUSAND THAT'S A THAT WERE THEY COMING FROM. DACULA MISSING AS WELL JUST WORKING BACKWARDS ON THE OF THE LABOR SHOULD GET WE HAVE BROUGHT. A HUNDREDS OF ADDITIONAL WORKERS IN MANY FROM OUT OF STATE -- TO HELP DO THIS WORK AND THE LABOR MARKET IS GETTING TIGHT AND WE WILL -- WE WILL SEE THAT -- WE'RE DOING A LOT OF INTERNAL TRAINING AS WELL WERE WE LOOKING AT HOW WE DO SOME THINGS WITH A NOD TO EFFICIENCY THIS IS PERHAPS LESS ON THE THE THE THE THE ACTUAL A DEPLOYMENT THE RESOURCES BUT THE PLANNING IN THE ENGINEERING RESOURCES. TO WILL HAVE TO HIT WITH TECHNOLOGY WITH TRAINING AND AND AGAIN -- BY HAVING MORE MORE WORKERS TRAINED TO DO THIS -- ONE OF THINGS THAT -- WE'RE WE'RE NOT KIDDING OURSELVES THIS IS NOT A SHORT TERM PROBLEM THIS IS A LONG TERM PROBLEM. AND SO AS WE CATCH UP I THINK THE LABOR WILL COME BECAUSE THIS IS I THINK -- SOMETHING WHERE WE WILL BE DOING THIS WORK FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THESE ARE -- IT GIVES ARE. PLACES WHERE WE NEED HIGHLY QUALIFIED TRAINED INDIVIDUALS AND AND WE WANT THEM HERE SO I I THINK WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL GET THAT RESPONSE RIGHT NOW IT IS VERY TIGHT -- IN TERMS OF CONVINCING -- EVERYONE THAT THIS IS THIS IS OUR YOUTH ASSIST REALLY IS WHAT WE'RE ABOUT NOW THIS IS -- HOW WE ARE FOCUSED AS AN ORGANIZATION I I CAN TELL YOU IT IS FROM THE TOP DOWN OF THIS ENTERPRISE? THAT WHILE FAR MITIGATION IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY -- WE ARE FOCUSED AND MORE MAIN FOCUS ON CONTINUING TO CHALLENGE OURSELVES AND WE HAVE A SEPARATE OFFICE DEDICATED TO JUST THIS ISSUE AND JUST THESE. SWEET OF THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT TO DO JUST THAT TO LOOK AT WHAT'S THE STATE OF THE INDUSTRY WAS A STATE OF TECHNOLOGY WAS A STATE OF SCIENTIFIC THINKING AROUND THIS SO -- I THINK WE'VE WE'VE DEVOLVED MUSCLE MEMORY HERE AND CHALLENGING THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT THINGS AND THIS IS A I PERSONALLY COMMITTED TO THIS. AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE'LL SEE OVER TIME IS HOW WE HOW WE ACTUALLY DEPLOY OUR OUR SOLUTIONS AND CONTINUE TO CHALLENGE OURSELVES. JUSTICE FOR THAT ADD ON TO THAT -- JUST IN TERMS OF THE THE LABOR ELEMENT YOUR QUESTION ABOUT HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ATTRACT -- THE RESOURCES SO WE'VE HAD TO DO IT AT A PREMIUM ACOSTA PREMIUM -- AND AND THAT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE OF FOR THE COST PREMIUM IN TERMS. SO SO SO SO BE IT IN TERMS OF TO TERMS AND CONDITIONS -- FOR THE CONTRACTORS RIGHT SO THERE'S A HIGHER HIGHER COST. OF STRUCTURE IN TERMS OF LABOR HOURS AS AN EXAMPLE -- THAT WE PUT FORWARD TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND AND THE REASON I BROUGHT THAT UP AS A BARRIER IS WE'VE REALLY. HITTING CALM THE MARKET CAP -- AND IT'S NOT A SUSTAINABLE WAY FOR US TO CONTINUE TO DO THIS IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW PAYING INDIVIDUALS ARE OUT OF STATE -- ON A ON AN ESCALATED CALL STRUCTURE WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT RESOURCES THAT'S GOING TO BE A CRITICAL ASPECT OF WHAT'S NEEDED WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. GOING FORWARD SO WE NEED A LONGER TERM. LABOR RESOURCE -- PROGRAM IN TERMS OF APPRENTICESHIP AND I THINK THERE'S REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY NOT JUST FOR THE THREE I'LL USE HERE BUT SOME OF THE THE STATE ENTITIES U. S. FOR SERVICES OF LEVERAGES THEM FROM. OF EDUCATION MATCHING PERSPECTIVE SO HOW DO WE REALLY GROW -- CALIFORNIA LABOR MARKET AS IT PERTAINS TO THE THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT RESOURCES IT'S IT'S A REAL ISSUE -- THAT WERE CONCERNED ABOUT AND BUT REALLY WILLING TO PARTNER TO ESTABLISH A LONG TERM. SUSTAINABLE SOLUTION SKINNER CITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO CONTINUE. MS EGGMAN QUESTIONS ABOUT THE UNDER GROUNDING -- YOU YOU TALK ABOUT COVER CONDUCTORS SICK OF BEING A LOT CHEAPER THAN UNDERGROUND YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE AS TO WHAT ORDER OF A YEAH IT'S PROBABLY A FACTOR OF EIGHT SO HE TO WE OUR RULE OF THUMB IS UNDER GROUNDING IS ROUGHLY THREE MILLION. DOLLARS A CIRCUIT MILE -- COVER CONDUCTOR IS ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DEPORTED SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A CIRCUIT MILE OKAY AND DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY. PROGRAMS WHERE. YOU WOULD SHARE THE COST WITH WITH CITIES IF IF CITIES WERE WILLING TO A FOOT FOR FOOT IN I'M A PART OF THE BILL THEY THEY YOU WOULD PARTNER AND PERHAPS PRIORITIZE UNDER GROUNDINGS IN COMMUNITIES WE HAVE A RULE TWENTY PROGRAMS THOSE ARE GENERALLY AND FRANKLY FOR AESTHETIC PURPOSES -- IS A CONVERSATION WERE WERE WILLING TO HAVE A SISTER THERE ISN'T A TERRAPIN PLACE FOR US IN IN SOCAL EDISON -- TO APPROACH ON A GROUNDING AS A RISK MITIGATION METHOD IN A COST SHARING MECHANISM. OKAY AND AND AND SO THAT WOULD -- TO IN IN TERMS OF THE EXISTING PROGRAM FOR STATIC PURPOSES IS IS SAID -- TO IT IS IS AT A ARRANGEMENT THAT YOU DIRECTLY ENTER INTO A CITIES ORDERED A DIEGO THROUGH THE CPC TO YEAH IT IT'S ROLE -- TWENTY IT'S RULE TWENTY EIGHT SO WE HAVE -- PROGRAMS WHERE CREDITS ARE BANKED IN CITIES CAN USE THOSE CREDITS -- AND APPLY THEM TOWARDS -- TOWARDS UNDER GROUNDING EFFORTS OKAY. ALL RIGHT PHAM. AND THEN I WANTED TO GO MOVE OUT I SAID I GOT STARTS ARE NOT TO TO NO NO I DON'T BUT I DO I DO I GET BACK TO ONE OF THE COST IS JUST ONE OF THE DIMENSIONS. WITH THE TIME TO DEPLOY HE IS A KEY -- ONE AND ALSO THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL MILES BUT REALLY TIME TO DEPLOY WANT ONE OF THESE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON IS REDUCING THE RISK AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE OF THE PROGRAM. OF COURSE SO I WENT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TARGETING TARGETED UNDER GROUNDING IN THE YEAR WE ARE YOU HEY HOW ARE YOU TARGETING IT WOULD BE WHERE WE WOULD IDENTIFY -- GREATER LEVELS OF REST THAT -- CAN BE DONE -- IN A YOU KNOW IT'S AN EXPEDITIOUS WAY SO IT WILL BE PART OF THE PORTFOLIO GOING FORWARD -- AND IT IT'S IT'S IN THE PROGRAM. ALL RIGHT. THUMB AND THEN I WANTED TO A OF TURN TO I I DON'T KNOW IF -- THE THE PANELISTS RECEIVED -- TO THE MEMO THAT WE RECEIVED AS AS PART OF THIS INFORMATION HEARING BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE THE THEIR PC IS GOING TO BE -- ASKING THE I. O. U.'S FOR METRICS THAT ARE FOCUSING NOT ON THE NUMBER OF ACTIONS TAKEN BUT INSTEAD ON HOW THOSE ACTIONS MEASURABLY REDUCE THE RISK OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRE -- I I I IMAGINE GIVEN THAT. LOOKS LIKE THERE'S A JULY DEADLINE THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON THAT BUT TO CAN YOU CAN YOU GIVE US A PREVIEW AS TO WHAT SOME OF THOSE -- THOSE -- THEY THE GENERAL PARAMETERS OF THOSE METRICS WOULD LOOK LIKE. SURE I CAN START OFF IN THE NINE BUT MY COLLEAGUES TO A CHIME IN -- SO SO WE'RE LOOKING AT BOTH OUTCOME BASED METRICS -- REALLY FROM A A LEADING AND A LAGGING -- PERSPECTIVE SOAP UP EXAMPLE OF A LAGGING INDICATOR -- IS A FIRE IGNITION -- OF OF A SMALL SIZE A AS AN EXAMPLE AND WE OF IDENTIFIES AS MR DEL CASTILLO STATED BEFORE SO ANY IGNITION -- WE CHARACTERIZE WHAT IS THE ACTUAL COST OF THAT IGNITION SO WAS THAT. A RESULT OF EQUIPMENT ISSUE -- WAS THAT A RESULT OF VEGETATION VEGETATION POTENTIALLY COMING IN CONTACT WITH A BARE WIRE THE BECAUSE THE OUR COURSE BARK SO. LOOKING AT THE VARIOUS IGNITION DRIVERS THAT RESULT IN THE POTENTIAL FAR ADDITION TO THAT'S MORE OF A LAGGING INDICATOR. THE COROLLARY TO THAT FOR A LEADING INDICATOR ISRAELI OUTAGES -- THAT ARE CAUSED BY THOSE SAME TYPES OF DRIVERS SO AS WE LOOK AT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ENHANCE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM OR THE INSPECTION PROCESS OR THE SYSTEM HARDENING THE REALLY GEARED TOWARDS REDUCE SAYING. NOT ONLY THE NUMBER OF IGNITION CAUSED BY VEGETATION OR EQUIPMENT DRIVEN ISSUES BUT ALSO OUTAGES OUTAGES IS WHERE WE MAY HAVE -- A IMPACT EITHER -- OF VEGETATION -- COMING IN CONTACT WITH A LINE THAT CREATES WHAT'S CALLED A FAULT -- AND EITHER THERE'S A MOMENTARY OR SUSTAINED OUT AGE. WHERE IT IMPACTS THE CIRCUIT AND THE CIRCUIT BASICALLY OPENS MEETING THAT THERE'S NO ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH IT ANYMORE -- AND REALLY WE ARE USING A THINKING ABOUT THE OUR AGE AS THE LEADING INDICATOR -- TO THE LAGGING INDICATOR A FAR DISTANCE A TRACKING BOTH OF THOSE AND AS WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT THE RISK REDUCTION MEASURES. NOW IS SEEING A DECLINE IN THE OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT OF THOSE RESPECTIVE VEGETATION OR EQUIPMENT COSTS OUTRAGEOUS. WHERE WERE IN A SIMILAR -- APPROACHING US IN A SIMILAR WAY I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IN SOME OF THE UC OUTCOME BASED EARLY ON IT IS THE AOUNT OF VOLATILITY IS GOING TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM GIVEN THE SIZE OF OUR SYSTEM. WOW QUICKLY YOU'LL SEE SOME OF THESE BUT THEY THEY THEY WILL BECOME A PART OF HOW WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PROGRAMS OVERALL -- AND AND WE'RE FRANKLY APPROACHING THIS THE SAME WAY THAT PROBABLY THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD IS -- WHERE WE ARE NOW IS REGARDLESS OF LOCATION OF OF -- OF A CIRCUIT PROBLEM WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR SYSTEM -- NOT JUST IN HIGH FIRE IS SCARY BUT ON THE NON HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS -- BECAUSE THINGS THAT OCCUR ON SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THE SYSTEM OVERALL CAN OPERATE. SO IF WE HAVE AN EVENT -- QUALITY -- MYLAR BALLOON COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE CIRCUIT IN A NON HIGH FOR A RISK AREA -- WILL EVALUATE THAT IT MAY BE THE KEY -- CAUSES EVIDENT OR SELF EVIDENT WHEN YOU SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED BUT IT WILL TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE DOING DIFFERENTLY. IN OTHER SPACES HI FIRE RISK AREAS IN TERMS OF MITIGATION EFFORTS IN THE CASE WHERE IT DOES MAKE A BIGGER DIFFERENCE IF WE HAVE AN EVENT THAT HAPPENED SO. WE'RE ESSENTIALLY GOING OUT AND DOING ANALYSES OF ALL OF OUR FAULTS -- AND WE'RE GOING TO DRESS THOSE IN THE PROGRAMS AND STANDARDS WE PUT IN PLACE FOR THE HIGHER FIRE RISK AREAS. YES IN FROM OUR STANDPOINT WERE LINING CLOSELY I'D SECOND EVERY EVERYTHING WE HEARD AND PER THE PROPOSED -- DECISION ON THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN WE WILL ALL BE ALIGNING EVEN MORE CLOSELY MOVING FORWARD. WE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROJECTS BECAUSE WHEN WE START LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE NUMBER OF IGNITIONS THE REALITY IS -- DROUGHT HAS A MAJOR IMPACT A NUMBER OF IGNITIONS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU LOOK AT THINGS LIKE WIRES DOWN. THE SEVERITY OF WINTER STORMS HAS MAJOR IMPACTS OF SOME OF THESE THINGS WHAT WE HAVE TO NORMALIZE THEM AND FIND WAYS. TO TO MAKE IT SO THAT THEY DON'T SKEW ALL THE INFORMATION BUT THAT BEING SAID WILL BE WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS MOVING FORWARD. ALL RIGHT. AND MY MY LAST QUESTION -- IS -- WITH THIS MEMO THAT DISCUSSES THAT RAISES THE ISSUE OF FOR WHETHER THE PC HAS THE THE CAPACITY. TO TO BE AN ADEQUATE -- SAFETY REGULATOR IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THEIR OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES AND I I LIKE AND KNOW IT. MAYBE AWKWARD TO A TO TO EVALUATE THE EVALUATOR -- OR BUT I WAS WONDERING IF -- IF YOU YOU CAN OFFER ANY. ANY THOUGHTS AS TO WHETHER THE PC IS UP -- TO THE IT HAS IT HAS THE NECESSARY -- CAPACITY. TO TO TO TO TO EVALUATE INTO OF OVERSEE THE THE THE THE THE WHILE FAR SAFETY. MEASURES THAT THE I. O. USER TAKING. AND IF I POOR WILL WELCOME YOUR RESPONSE TO THIS QUESTION BUT WE DO HAVE ANOTHER PANEL THAT SQUARE AUDITOR'S NOW THAT'S A QUICK. TO FOCUS ON OVERSIGHT SO. IF YOU DO HAVE A RESPONSE WHICH I DO WELCOME -- JUST MAKE IT A QUICK RESPONSE SO THAT WE CAN HELLO THE NEXT BATTLE TO GET. TWO MORE INTO THE WEEDS ON IT IF YOU. I I WOULD JUST SAY -- I I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS ACROSS THE BOARD -- I I THINK YOU KNOW THE THE COMMISSION. HAS A RESOURCES AND IS THE REAL QUESTION IS JUST HOW WE PARTNER IS -- TO TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS I THINK IT'S WE WE NEED GUIDANCE AND STRUCTURE AROUND WHAT WE'RE DOING CAN BE VERY HELPFUL. WE HAVE THAT IS -- ENTERPRISES NOT JUST WITH OURSELVES BUT ALSO OUTSIDE OF HIS COLLABORATED ON TRYING TO FIND THE BEST SOLUTIONS THAT WE CAN TO MITIGATE WILDFIRE RISK -- WE WE DON'T WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH WITH AGENCIES AND THE CBC AND ARE GOVERNED PARTNERS AT CAL -- AWESOME MERCY SERVICES CAL FIRE AND OTHERS BECAUSE I DO THINK THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT -- ANYONE ENTERPRISE OR AGENCY REALLY -- CAN ADDRESS I THINK THIS IS GOING TO TAKE. A LOT OF RESOURCES AND A LOT OF AGENCIES A LOT OF DIFFERENT -- IMPORTS ACROSS THE THE REGULATORY LEGISLATIVE COMPLEX AS WELL AS ENTITIES LIKE OURSELVES WHO WERE OR BE REGULATED AND WE WE HAVE PART OF THE SOLUTION. SO IT'S IT'S GOING TO BE A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT SO I'D RATHER NOT ADDRESS THAT DUDE'S GOT THE CAPABILITY BECAUSE I I I REALLY THINK -- YOU COULD STRUCTURE AT HOWEVER YOU NEEDED TO WHATEVER AGENCIES HAVE THE CAPABILITY [inaudible] THANK YOU. THE CITY IS CLICK -- I'M SORRY WE HAVE YEAH ONE MORE QUESTION THE FREE IS THERE ANYONE ELSE ON THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE. TO OKAY OKAY DOCTOR QUIRK -- SO YOU'RE. YOUR HEDGED IN AND HOW FAST YOU CAN DO THIS BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS. A ONE OF THEM OF COURSE IS REACHING OUT TO THE PUBLIC ON TREES AND POWER -- SHUT OFFS I WOULD JUST STRESS THAT YOU TAKE SAFETY IS THE NUMBER ONE CONCERN TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN. REACH OUT THAT'S WONDERFUL BUT PLEASE CUT THE TREES IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD IF YOU HAVE TO DO IT RIGHT AWAY AND TURN OFF THE POWER WHEN YOU NEED TO I'LL I'LL SURVIVE. YOU MAY NEED -- PROTECTION FROM SUITS IF THAT'S AN ISSUE YOU NEED TO BRING THAT TO US. OUR BECAUSE PEOPLE MAY SUE OVER TREES CUT OR POWER BEING SHUT OFF AND LOSSES OF ONE TYPE OR ANOTHER. AND YOU ALREADY ADDRESSED THE SAFETY CONCERNS OVER SHUTTING OFF POWER WHICH IS ONE REASON IT HASN'T BEEN ROUTINE BEFORE THIS -- YOU'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT COST VERSUS SAFETY. WE ONLY HAVE TO AVOID ONE OR TWO FIRES EVERY DECADE OF THAT SORT OF CATASTROPHIC TYPE WE'VE HAD. TO MAKE IT WORTH WHILE TO MAYBE DO UNDER GROUNDING VERSUS -- I WORKING ON THE CONDUCTORS. SO. I THINK SOMEBODY SHOULD. SEE IF THERE'S A REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UNDER GROUNDING. AND MAKING THE WIRE SAY -- FOR WITH THE SYSTEM SUCH AS CUTTING OFF THE POWER WHEN THE LINE BREAKS IT CETERA WHAT'S THE COST OF THAT FIRST IS THE COST OF UNDERGROUND IN AND BY THE WAY ON THE GROUND IN THIS YOU MENTIONED ALSO MEANS A LOT MORE MAINTENANCE. BUT IF WE COULD SEE WHAT WHAT THOSE COSTS ARE AND LOOK AT THEM SIDE BY SIDE. AND DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT IT SAVES A CATASTROPHIC FIRE EVERY DECADE OR TWO IT MIGHT BE WORTH IT AND I'M JUST SAYING PLEASE DO NOT RULE THAT OUT AND PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. UP FINALLY YOU MENTIONED THE NUMBER OF THINGS THAT PREVENT YOU FROM -- MAKING PROGRESS AS FAST AS YOU'D LIKE SHORTNESS OF SHORTNESS OF LABOR. AND THEIR ALTHOUGH YOU'RE BRINGING IN TRAIN PEOPLE FROM OUT OF STATE. WE HAD TO HAVE A LOT OF UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE AND YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT -- HAVING APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND SUCH TO DO THE TRAINING TO THE EXTENT YOU CAN DO THAT. I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE AREAS WITH VERY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT. AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT THOSE FOLKS WOULD BE ABLE -- TO DO THAT WORK. THEN FINALLY I'M JUST TRYING TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT'S REALLY SLOWING YOU DOWN -- SO YOU MENTIONED THERE'S NO TERRA FOR UNDERGROUND IN WHICH FOR PEOPLE ME FOR THE FOR NORMAL PEOPLE THAT MEANS YOU HAVE NO SOURCES OF FUNDING. THAT WOULD BE AN ISSUE THAT WE GO THROUGH THE C. P. U. C.. V. R. CHAIR OF THE P. YOU SEE WHEN HE'S BEEN HERE HAS SAID THEY HAVE TOO MANY THINGS TO DO ALREADY -- HE'S TALKED ABOUT GETTING RID OF IN THIS IS PROBABLY SOMETHING WE SHOULD LOOK AT TOGETHER WITH THE PRESIDENT THE C. P. U. C. AS I LOOK OVER TO THE CHAIR HERE -- HE'S TALKED ABOUT MOVING TRUCK BEING AND OTHER SUCH AREAS OUT OF THE C. P. U. C.. FOR WHICH THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE IN TRYING TO LIMIT WHAT THEY CAN LOOK AT AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE DOING. BUT THEN WHAT MY REAL QUESTION DEALS WITH WHAT REALLY IS SLOWING YOU DOWN IS IT A LACK OF CAPITAL OF MONEY. IS THE LACK OF WORKERS -- EASY JUST TAKING LONG TIME TO GET -- BUREAUCRATIC APPROVALS FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING -- FOR PER DAY FOR PERMISSION TO DO THINGS A PARTICULAR WAY WHAT REALLY IS -- THE PROBLEM WITH THE IN TERMS OF NOT BEING ABLE TO GO AS FAST AS YOU MIGHT LIKE. TO TIPS SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT THANKS FOR THE COMMENTS ON THE AND THE QUESTION FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S BEEN THE OTHER QUALIFIED WORKFORCE. THAT THAT'S ONE KEY ELEMENT -- A IN SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PIECE SAYS. BEEN I PUT FORWARD -- BLAST AT THE END OF LAST YEAR. WE PRETTY MUCH OF WERE OFFERING. KIND OF A HOURLY RATE RIGHT AT WHAT TIME AND PUT AND IT'S IT'S CALLED THE HIGHEST RATE POSSIBLE WITHIN THE THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. OF SPACE AND WHAT WE WERE FINDING IS THAT THERE'S KIND OF THAT LIMITATION ON THE QUALIFICATION OF THE INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THAT THE WARRICK -- ITSELF IS ONE OF THE HIGHLY HAZARDOUS TASKS THAT'S DONE WITHIN THE NATION RIGHT NOW WE LOOK AT LOGGING. AND NOW WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TRIMMING IN AND AROUND -- ENERGIZED ELECTRICAL LINES IT'S ONE OF THE HIGHEST HAZARDOUS TASSEL REQUIRES A TRAINED PROFESSIONAL AN INDIVIDUAL AND WHAT WE WERE IDENTIFYING. IS OVER TIME AS WE WERE CONTINUING TO OFFER INCENTIVES TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE RESOURCES OF EVER GETTING RESOURCES THAT WERE NOT QUALIFIED TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK AS AS WE WERE DOING THE SAFETY OBSERVATION SO THERE'S KIND OF THAT -- BUREAU OF FINITE SET OF POPULATION OF A NUMBER OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL SO THAT'S ONE ONE DIMENSION. THE OTHER DIMENSION IS -- IN THIS IS NOT WITH ALL OF THE ENTITIES WE WE HAVE FOUND MUCH BETTER ENGAGEMENT PARTNERSHIP COOPERATION. WHETHER IT'S PRIVATE CUSTOMERS OR IT'S THE VARIOUS ENTITIES TO BE ABLE TO GET THE NECESSARY ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITTING -- THE ENDANGERED SPECIES -- SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS WORKING WITH THE VARIOUS FOR SERVICE ENTITIES -- THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT AS AN EXAMPLE THERE'S THE FEDERAL OR STATE ENTITY -- THERE'S A LOT THAT WE'RE DOING AND THEY'RE REALLY STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING -- HABITAT CONSERVATION PLANS THAT ARE PRE ESTABLISHED WITH THE MEDICATION PRACTICES ALSO THERE'S A LOT THAT'S BEEN DONE IN THAT SPACE -- BUT NOT THOSE ALSO TEND TO BE -- ELEMENTS FOR SOME OF THE AREAS WHERE IT TAKES A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO BE ABLE. TO DO THE NEGOTIATION WITHOUT SOME OF THE CUSTOMERS THAT REALLY LOVE THEIR TREE THAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND KIND OF THE WRIST A WE'RE TRYING TO PUT FORWARD. ALSO SOME OF THOSE -- CHALLENGES STILL EXIST OUT THERE YEAH TO THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOU COULD USE LEGISLATIVE HELP I WOULD HELP HOPE THAT YOU WORK -- TO LET US KNOW THAT. AND THAT WOULD BE VERY USEFUL -- THEN I HAVE A QUESTION A PARTICULAR FOUR EDITION -- HOW MUCH IS THIS GOING TO COST YOU I DON'T S. P. JEANNIE BECAUSE THEY'RE IN BANKRUPTCY? AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY CAN SAY OR WHAT THEY CAN'T SAY BUT SINCE YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS OUT LONG TERM. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION A BILLION TEN BILLION I I JUST A BALLPARK IT. RIGHT NOW IT TO AGAIN LET'S TALK ABOUT THE THE TIME DURATION OF COURSE AND MOON PROCESS OF PREPARING OUR NEXT GENERAL RIGHT CASE -- WHICH WE EXPECT TO SUBMIT LATER THIS YEAR -- WHAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US NOW IS A PROGRAM BY -- NINETEEN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND TWENTY AND THAT'S SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR COVER CONDUCTOR IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME NOT AND OTHER MITIGATION ACTIVITIES -- AS WE CONTINUE TO EXPAND THIS WE WILL BE LOOKING AT NUMBERS -- YOU KNOW NORTH OF THE BILLION DOLLARS THIS IS A A LARGE SYSTEM WE'RE COVERING AND ADDRESSING AND SO IT WILL -- IT WILL COME WITH COST -- IT IS SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO JUST ALSO WOULD SPEAK TO THE THE LABOR ISSUE BECAUSE IT BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE PUSHING HARD ON JUST UNDERSCORE -- THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS ONE THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET ADDITIONAL CREWS AND AND KEEP OUR WORK MOVING. OUT WE CAN ALWAYS USE MORE. BUT WE THINK ABOUT THE TRAIN LINE CREWS -- YOU KNOW THOSE APPRENTICE PROGRAMS ARE THREE YEARS LONG. AND EVEN WHEN YOU BRING RESOURCES IN FROM OUT OF STATE THEY NEED TO BE TRAINED AND UNDERSTAND OUR SYSTEM AND OUR WEEK WAY OF DOING THINGS. THAT IS NOT JUST PARTICULARITIES IT'S ACTUALLY ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS FROM UTILITY UTILITY SOMETIMES DIFFER IN MEANINGFUL WAYS -- BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALK ABOUT PAYS WE TALK ABOUT THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO BRING ON BOARD. WE ALSO NEED TO BRING ON BOARD -- WORKERS WHO OPERATE SAFELY AND ARE NOT A HAZARD TO THEMSELVES AND AND HAZARD TO PEOPLE AROUND THEM AND THAT YOU CAN DO THE WORK IN A QUALITY WAY. BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IF WE DO A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE WORK AND IS NOT DONE -- TO THE QUALITY STANDARDS WE NEED. WE WE REALLY HAVEN'T DONE OURSELVES ANY FAVOR THE MITIGATION SPACE OKAY SO. THE OTHER THING IS TO GET THE BILLION DOLLARS I ASSUME YOU BE BORROWING MONEY AND THEN HAVING THAT HAVE PAID BACK BY RATE PAYERS OVER TIME. THAT'S CORRECT. AND THEN. GIVEN THAT. YOU'VE BEEN DOWNGRADED SO GO LATELY IN YOUR ABILITY TO BORROW YOU'RE JUST BARELY ABOVE. JUNK BOND STATUS. HOW MUCH MORE SAID GUN IS THAT GONNA LIKE DOUBLE THE COSTS TO RATEPAYERS OR? ARMS OF THE INTEREST RATE YEAH SOME AND I DON'T HAVE THOSE FIGURES HANDY THEY THEY WILL DRIVE COSTS UP -- IN A IN A NOT INSUBSTANTIAL WAY THOUGH AND I THINK THAT THOSE COSTS WILL BE PASSED ON THROUGH BILLS OKAY SO THE I WON'T ASK THE REST OF YOU TO TALK TO BE -- THE BEING NOTICED THAT THE CHAIR WANTS TO MOVE THIS ALONG THANK YOU OKAY. WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR BEING HERE MISTER THE AGOSTINO HURTS AND THEN MR SAYING -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING YOU COME BACK THIS IS SAYS ROOF NOTED -- IN OUR ANALYSIS AND AS WE'VE SHARED AND YOU'VE ALWAYS SEE RESPONDED TO THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ERA OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO PREPARE. AND WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE IN THE BEST POSITION TO SEE THAT YOUR PLANS ARE APPROVED AND THAT THEY'RE COVERING THE KINDS OF ISSUES THAT THE WHO KEEP THE COMMUNITY SAFE. OF OUR NEXT PANEL WILL LOOK AT OVERSIGHT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THE OTHER PART OF THE EQUATION HERE SO. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR FOR BEING HERE AND WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR CONVERSATION WITH YOU THANK CHAIRMAN THANK YOU MAY I MAKE CHAIRMAN AND IF WE CAN CALL FORWARD THE OUR SECOND PANEL ON OVERSIGHT AND EVALUATION -- ELISABETH A MALLET CINCO -- DEPUTY EXECUTIVE RECTOR SAFETY IN ENFORCEMENT CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. DANIEL BURLAP ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR CHIEF OF PLANNING AND RISK ANALYSIS OUR ENGINEERING AND INVESTIGATIONS DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY AND FIRE PROTECTION. AND ROSS BROWN PRINCIPLE FISCAL AND POLICY ANALYSIS LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE WELCOME IS TO HAVE YOU HERE AND IF WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOU START IN THE ORDER THAT YOUR CALL FOR DAVID. APPRECIATE HEARING YOUR PRESENTATION AND AS YOU KNOW. AND PART OF THE EARLIER -- HEARING OR PANEL DISCUSSION -- THE ISSUE OF YOU SEE OVERSIGHT IN THE ABILITY TO ADDRESS ALL THESE VERY NEEDS OF THAT FALL WITH UNDER WITHIN THE PC -- TO BE ABLE TO BE IN A POSITION. TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE SAFETY ISSUES I THINK IS SORT OF UP FRONT. A QUESTION IS IN FRONT OF US BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR OPENING COMMENTS AND ANY QUESTIONS OR MAY HAVE. AFTER THAT. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M GIVING. TO THE TRADE KEEP MY REMARKS SHORT TO LEAVE IT OPEN FOR QUESTIONS AND MIND HIS VIEW TO MOTION COULD THE P. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION -- AND EIGHT EIGHT THINK OF GOING TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT'S WHEN IT COMES TO UTILITY WILD FIRE. RESPONSE MITIGATION ELM AND EFFORTS THAT THE ARE PUTTING IN PLACE NO PLEA BOOK THAT YOU CAN POINT TO TO SAY THIS IS WHAT A UTILITY SHOULD BE DOING -- THERE ARE BEST PRACTICES -- OUT THERE AND THAT'S BEEN MY EIGHT TOP FOCUS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IS TO IDENTIFY THEM AND SPEAKING WITH. REGULATORS IN THE THIS RALLY AND COUNTED IN OF THE STATE'S. WITH UTILITIES AND OTHER EXPERTS. AND BRINGING THEM TOGETHER TO CALIFORNIA WE HAD A WELFARE IT'S COLLEGE INNOVATION SUMMIT'S IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR. L. FOR THAT PURPOSE TO HAVE THE DIALOGUE AND SO WHILE. THERE ARE BEST PRACTICES AND REALLY GOOD IDEAS THAT EXIST. THERE IS NO SINGLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION AND THERE IS NO STANDARD IN THE INDUSTRY -- THAT EXISTS SO AS OF TODAY. THE THERE IS NOTHING THERE'S NO FRAMEWORK IN THERE'S NO STANDARD FOR THE COMMISSION TO EVALUATE THE WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS. AGAINST WE ALL CAN HAVE OUR OWN OPINIONS AS TO WHAT THE UTILITIES ARE DOING ENOUGH WELL OR NOT SO WITH THE RIGHT KINDS OF THINGS BUT THERE'S NO. THERE'S THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S BEEN AGREED UPON BY A EXPERTS IN THE SPACE. HELLO MY AND THAT I WOULD SAY THE CHALLENGE FROM A FROM A REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE THE CPUC PROCESS. THE THE COMMISSION OUT FUNCTIONS LOU LOU LIKE A COURTS IN MANY WAYS -- AND IS IN THE WHOLE WORLD. IN ALL OUR EFFORTS. AND ILL THE WAY THE PROCESS WORKS IS WHEN THE UTILITIES -- IN THIS CASE SUBMITS WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS AS APPLICATIONS OF THE COMMISSION OPENS A PROCEEDING AND ALLOWS FOR ARE THE PARTIES TO COMMENTS AND THEN THE STAFF IS SUPPOSED TO HOLD. THE COMMISSION ADVISORY CAPACITY TO EVALUATE THE DIFFERENT COMMENTS THE THE ORIGINAL APPLICATION IN THE COMMENTS FROM VARIOUS PARTIES. AND THEN HOLD THE COMMISSION COME UP WITH THE BALANCE IN FAVOR DECISION IT WORKS. VERY WELL WHEN WE HAVE RATE CASES FOR EXAMPLE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A UTILITY ASKING FOR MONEY AND THEN YOU HELP REPAIR ADVOCATES WHO PUSH BACK ON UTILITIES AND DEVELOP A RECORD THAT THEN YOU CAN EVALUATE THE COME UP WITH THE BALANCED. DECISION IT WORKS FAIRLY WELL IN THE RENEWABLE SPACE WE YOU HOW OF ELVES. A VERY ORGANIZED INTEREST GROUPS AROUND SOLAR AROUND ENERGY STORAGE ABOUT MICHAEL GRADES WOULD DO A GOOD JOB ADVOCATING FOR THEIR ALL POINT ENVY ENVIRONMENTAL L. AGENCIES THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN THE IN THE AREA OF OF SAFETY OF WILDFIRES THAT SAFETY IN PARTICULAR. SO WHEN WE HAVE A WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS AND OPEN THE PRECEDING WHAT OVER THIRTY PARTIES WHO JOINS THIS PROCESS BUT WHEN WE'RE ORGANIZING THE WORKSHOPS I PULLED THE PARTIES TO SAY HEY WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. ON CONDUCTORS. ELEMENT AND ON A COUPLE OF OTHER ITEMS BUT DO WE HAVE ANYBODY FROM THE PARTY'S SCORE HOW EXPERTISE IN ANY OF THESE AREAS WHO COULD PARTICIPATES IN THE WORKSHOPS IN A MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE WITH THE UTILITY AND WHEN GETTING YOUR BODY. ALL THIS IS A IT THINK ONE PERSON THAT'S SORT OF PASSED THE L. THAT SO. QUESTION -- HOME BUT IT'S THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW THERE WAS A LOT OF INTEREST GROUPS ALL. AGAINST THE SOLAR AND OTHER IT TYPICAL INTERVENOR IS BUT THEY DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE IN THE SPACE SO WE REALLY LACK THE RECORD THAT WE TYPICALLY WOULD HOP IN OTHER TYPE OF POLICY MATTERS. THAT THE THAT IS INFORMATIVE. AND NOT IN THAT SENSE. ALL MY YOU IT WITH SEE IT YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR BEST PRACTICES AND WE EIGHT THINK HALL ENOUGH. TO EVALUATE THAT THE UTILITIES OR DOING THE RIGHT KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE WOULD BE EXPECTING THEM TO DO. ALL UNITS YOU LOOK AT THE PLANS THE ROLE FAIRLY SIMILAR IN TERMS ALL THE KINDS OF PROGRAMS THAT UTILITIES HOW I THINK YOU HEARD THAT FROM THEIR PRESENTATIONS -- THEY DIFFER IN TERMS OF WHERE THEY ARE THEY'RE STARTING POINTS IN TERMS OF THEIR PIECE OF THIS SCALE NOW ALL WE'RE THEY'RE PUTTING SOME OF THE EMPHASIS. ELM. BUT THEY ALL HAVE VERY SIMILAR ELEMENTS OF BUILDING BLOCKS. AND ELM THE COMMISSION MOSTLY EVALUATED THE HOME FOR COMPLIANCE WITH SB NINE A ONE THE BILL THAT ESTABLISH THIS PROCESS THE OUTLINE NINETEEN SPECIFIC CRITERIA THAT THOSE PLANS. IT'S A HOUSE BILL WHICH THE L. PROPOSED DECISION THEN STOPS EVALUATION PROPOSES THAT THE DUDE CUTS THAT COVERED THE THE NINETEEN ITEMS THAT THE WAS SUPPOSED TO COVER. AND THE MAIN. HELP QUEENS ELM THAT THE PROPOSAL THAT'S THAT'S CURRENTLY OUT IS RAISING. IS THE ISSUE OF METRICS AND EVALUATING EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE MEASURES THE SB NINE OH ONE REQUIRED UTILITIES TO INCLUDES PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS AS PART OF THEIR FILINGS WITH ALL OF THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES THE UTILITY SUBMITTED. WERE. FOCUSED ON THE PIECE OF DEPLOYMENT HOME IT WOULDN'T HAVE ANY WEATHER STATIONS THE DOING HOW YOU KNOW HOW MUCH VEGETATION MANAGEMENT THE DOING HOW MANY MILES OF OF LINES THE REPLACING. A LOT LOTS COMMUTING TO ANY SPECIFIC RESULTS WILL OF THOSE ACTIVITY IS. AND ELEMENT IN THE SOTHE COULD ONE OF THE THINGS THE COMMISSION THE SAYINGS OF FOR US TO OVER TIME TO EVEN BEGIN TO BE. A BE ABLE TO MAKE BETTER DECISIONS AROUND THIS WE NEED TO START PLAYING THESE PROGRAMS TO PERFORMANCE AND ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COVERED TO CONDUCT THERE IS AND ACTUALLY HOW THE DATA BEHIND IT TO HOW MANY IGNITIONS AS AN EXAMPLE -- THEY REDUCE AND IT SAID THAT THAT THAT'S ONE AREA HOME AS THE NEXT STEPS THE COMMISSION -- WOULD BE VOTING TO ADOPT OF THOSE PLANS. AND THEN L.. WE WE REALLY WOULD BE STARTING THE PROCESS ALL. THEM PLANNING FOR THE NEXT ROUND YOU KNOW I THINK I'LL AND WITH THE COVERING THIS QUESTION ALL OF THE P. YOU SEE CAPABILITIES IN EVALUATING THESE KINDS OF PLANS AND EVALUATION OF DO THEIR IMPLEMENTATION. AND YEAH I THINK WE HELL OF A LOT OF ROOM TO GROW IN THIS SPACE I MEAN THIS FIRST ROUND WE DID WITH NO ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL FOR HAS BEEN NINE OH ONE IS STILL IN. THE BEING CONSIDERED -- SO WE DID SOME REASSIGNMENTS BUT IT'S YOU KNOW WHERE WE WEREN'T SET UP TO BE EXPERTS IN THE US OUR STAFF ARE GENERALISTS WHO WE HIRE OUT OF MASTER'S PROGRAMS WITH JUNE WITH ENGINEERING DEGREES AND YEAH AND THE NO THIS IS. A SPACE WHERE. PEOPLE HAVE ENTIRE CAREERS DEDICATED JUST. ONE SPECIFIC ASPECT OF IT AND WHEN YOU HAVE UTILITIES PREPARING THEIR PLANS THE HEALTH EXPERTS IN METEOROLOGISTS AND FIRE WEATHER EXPERTS AND EXPERTS WERE ARBORISTS AND YOU KNOW EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE IS WRITTEN BY. THEIR TOP EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD SO IT IS GENERALLY AGAIN YOU SEE ISN'T SET UP TO TO TOP THE EXPERTISE OF UTILITY THAT'S JUST NOT HOW OUR PROCESS WORKS. SO YOU THINK THAT'S A GAP. OF I'VE BE A HOLLOW PROPOSAL IS PART OF THE ME REVISE RIGHT NOW OF HOW I THINK WE CAN THE DRESS SETS WHICH IS BY IN THE SHORT TERM HIRING MORE CONSULTANTS TO WORK. HOME FOR THE P. YOU SEE OUT SO THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY WILL COMMENCE ALL THE RECORD AND BE ABLE. TO FULLY ELM. HELP EXPERTS AS PART OF OUR TEAM WHO CAN ASK DEEPER QUESTIONS IN EACH OF THOSE SUBJECT AT OUT OF AREAS. ALL MAY THINK WE ALSO LACKEY ELM. THE VISION OF WHERE ARE WE GOING WITH ALL OF THE S. THRE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITY THAT'S BEING PROPOSED AS THE PART OF WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS. IN THE GROUP LOOKS LIKE THE RIGHT TYPE OF ACTIVITY BUT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ARTICULATED VISION OF WHAT GOALS WERE TRYING TO HIT. L. IN THE FUTURE. AND YOU KNOW WE HEAR A LOT OF YOU KNOW STATEMENTS ALL OF THIS IS GOING TO TAKE A LONG TIME WE SHOULDN'T EXPECT THAT THIS FIRST ROUND THE WELFARE MITIGATION PLANS IN THESE EFFORTS THE UTILITIES ARE PUTTING A PLACE RIGHT NOW. WILL ADDRESS ALL WILD FIRE PROBLEMS THIS YEAR THIS WILDFIRE. SEASON THE THAT WERE DONE ANYTHING THIS GENERALLY RECOGNITION DIGITAL LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY OF THIS PROBLEM WE CAN EXPECT A SIMPLE SOLUTION. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO UNPACK THIS A BIT MORE AND GET MORE SPECIFIC WHAT DOES THIS MEAN HOW LONG OF A ROAD MAP WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SO WE TALKING ABOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE MEASURABLE RESULTS. IN FIVE YEARS OF THREE YEARS AND TEN YEARS IN FIFTY YEARS LIKE WAR AND AND HOW WE GOING. TO TRACK THAT AND WHAT DOES THAT SYSTEM OF THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE IS IT SOMETHING THAT'S MORE RELIANCE ON THE ON MICRO GRIDS. AND ELHAM. UNDER GROUNDING OR IS IT COVERED CONDUCTORS WHAT'S THE ROLE OF WHAT THE MONITORING AND HOLLER ALL THESE PIECES GOING TO COME TOGETHER AND WHERE ARE WE GOING. SO AGAIN RIGHT NOW THAT DOES NOT EXIST AND I THINK THAT'S A GAP THAT NEEDS TO BE FILLED. WELCOME AND IN TERMS ALL OF COMPLIANCE ELM YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THAT FRONT AS WELL. ALL IS SPECIALLY A THING IN AS WE KIND OF WORK ON LARGER ISSUES THE WAY RIGHT NOW FACING. ALL OF REALLY ARTICULATING OF THE ROLE OF THE PLANS BECAUSE TYPICALLY WHEN YOU DOING COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. YOU WANT TO AND FOR US TO REGULATION TO A STANDARD THAT'S BLACK AND WHITE. ALL MY PLANS GENERALLY PLAY AT THE FRONT OF THE ROLE -- HOME AND I THINK KIND OF FIGURING OUT THE BALANCE OF BLACK AND WHITE REGULATIONS THAT SET THE FLOOR THAT WE EXPECT THE 100% COMPLIANCE WITH THE VERSES THE ROLE OF THE PLANS. THAT -- MORE TO QUEUE LEADING THE PACE OF DEPLOYMENT OF CERTAIN PSYCHOLOGIES OR ACTIVITIES OF UTILITIES AND KINDA HOW YOU RECONCILE THOSE THINGS. ELM AND WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO BE WANDERING PERFORMANCE TO AND WHAT FOR ELM I THINK A LOT OF IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT -- HOLLAND'S B. AND L. FULLY ANSWERED YES IN THE WORKING OF LARGER REGULATORY SCHEME THANK YOU. WELL GOOD AFTERNOON. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON MY NAME IS DANIEL WERE LANTA ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH CAL FIRE -- OVERSEEING -- MANY OF OUR FIRE PREVENTION PROGRAMS -- INCLUDING -- UTILITY MITIGATION -- THE FOCUS OF MY TESTIMONY TODAY WILL BE ON CALPERS INVOLVEMENT IN REVIEWING THE PLANS -- BUT I DO WANT TO JUST STAYED AT THE AT THE BEGINNING HERE THAT I WON'T BE SPEAKING DIRECTLY ON A SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL PLANS -- AS I DON'T HAVE DIRECT KNOWLEDGE ON THE SPECIFIC CONTENT -- SINCE OUR COMMENTS -- THEY'RE STILL BEING OFFERED TO THE C. P. YOU SEE IN OUR PART OF THEIR THE COMMISSION'S ONGOING DELIVERED A PROCESS -- BUT IT'S A FOR IMPORTANT UP TO EMPHASIZE AT THE OUTSET HERE THAT ADOPTING TO WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA'S DRY MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATE OUT REALLY REQUIRES A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH -- THAT MEANS IN ADDITION TO FOCUSING ON PREVENTING UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRES. WE ALSO HAVE TO INCLUDE PLANS ON MAKING SURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE HARDENED AGAINST WILDFIRES THAT THEY IF YOU'LL BREAK IN AND AROUND -- NEIGHBORHOODS WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES HAVE PROPER EVACUATION ROUTES WATER SUPPLIES -- FIRE PROTECTION RESOURCES -- WE'VE TO BUILD HOMES OUT OF AMBER RESISTANT BUILDING MATERIALS WHILE MAINTAINING A HUNDRED FEET A DEFENSIBLE SPACE. BY REMOVING DEAD AN OVERGROWN VEGETATION. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO UNDERTAKE LARGE SCALE PROJECTS THAT RETURN OUR FORCE IN OUR WILD LANDS -- BACK TO THEIR HEALTHY STATE AND OF COURSE WE NEED TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC -- TO PREVENT THE START OF HUMAN CAUSED WILDFIRES SO THIS IS REALLY A AT AN ALL INCLUSIVE -- APPROACH NOW A LARGE PORTION OF CAL FIRES MISSION IS TO WORK TOWARDS PREVENTING WILDFIRES -- FROM OCCURRING IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS -- OBVIOUSLY WE'VE SEEN A TREND OF LARGER DAMAGING WILDFIRES -- THAT EVEN BECAUSE BY UTILITY OWNED A POWER LINES IN INFRASTRUCTURE. ANALYZING THE PAST FIVE YEARS OF OF FIRE DATA -- UTILITIES PARK WILDFIRES MAKE UP ABOUT 9% OF THE OVERALL WILDFIRES WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION OVER THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA. HOWEVER THESE FIRES CONSTITUTE ABOUT 21% OF THE OVERALL ACRES -- THAT ARE BURNED AND SO TYPICALLY WHAT WE FIND IN THESE TYPES OF FIRES IS THAT THEY ARE COUPLED WITH SIGNIFICANT WEATHER EVENTS -- THAT FANNED THE FLAMES AND ALLOW THE FIRES TO GROW -- VERY QUICKLY AND VERY SIGNIFICANTLY. IN RECENT YEARS OUT WE FOCUS -- TO IN SUPPORTING OUR STATEWIDE EFFORTS TO REDUCE UTILITIES PARK WILDFIRES -- QUITE HEAVILY NOW THREE YEARS AGO FOLLOWING THE PASSAGE OF SB AT TEN TWENTY EIGHT BY SENATOR HILL -- WHICH REQUIRED THE CHILI MITIGATION -- PLANS -- TO BE FORMED -- CAL FIRE BEGAN ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION -- IN PROVIDING OUR WILDFIRE EXPERTISE -- IN THE CREATION OF THE PLAN TEMPLATE. THE FOLLOWING YEAR -- WE WORK WITH THE C. P. YOU SEE AND WE PUT TOGETHER A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING -- TO SHARE RESOURCES KNOWLEDGE -- AND BEST PRACTICES IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING A STRATEGY THAT WAS A CONSISTENT APPROACH AMONGST. THE AGENCIES IN ORDER TO PREVENT THESE TYPES OF FIRES. NOW THIS MAY SOUND ROUTINE -- BUT OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS I WOULD SAY THAT THAT THIS WORK AND THIS COLLABORATION I HAS BEEN CRITICAL. CAL FIRE BRINGS TO THE TABLE HERE EXPERTISE IN WILD FIRE SUPPRESSION WE HAVE EXT. A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN PREVENTING THESE TYPES OF FIRES AND SO THAT'S WHAT ARE WHAT WE BRING TO THE REVIEW TEAM BUT I'LL JUST SPEAK FOR MY COLLEAGUE HERE THE CPUC. THEY BRING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE RELATED TO CHILE INFRASTRUCTURE UTILITY OPERATIONS REGULATION IN ENGINEERING THESE ARE NOT NECESSARILY -- ITEMS THAT WE HAVE AS AN AGENCY SO WORKING TOGETHER WORKING COLLABORATIVELY.WE WE CREATE A STRONG TEAM -- THAT CAN TACKLE THESE ISSUES -- AND AND SPECIFICALLY THESE ISSUES CRITICAL TO PUBLIC SAFETY. SO THE WALL FOR MITIGATION PLANS -- AS I MENTIONED ARE AN OVERALL PART OF OUR OUR OVERALL UTILITY BECAUSE WILDFIRE PREVENTION EFFORTS -- AMONG OTHER THINGS IN THE PLANS -- WE ANALYZED WHERE ENHANCED VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS NEEDED TO PREVENT CONTACT BETWEEN VEGETATION LIVE WIRES -- WE LOOKED AT WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES THE POWER -- SHOULD BE SHUT OFF TEMPORARILY TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY -- WHERE UTILITY SYSTEMS -- SHOULD BE HARDENED AGAINST EXTREME WEATHER AND OTHER THREATS -- THREE USING THINGS LIKE COVERED CONDUCTORS AND FOR I RESISTED PULL MATERIALS LIKE YOU HEARD EARLIER AND WHERE AND WHEN OVERHEAD POWER LINES SHOULD BE RELOCATED UNDERGROUND. COMING BACK TO IT TOO TO SEE IF YOU SEE OUR INCREASE PARTNERSHIP OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS -- HAS ALREADY COMMITTED A PART TIME I IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE COMMISSION TO REVIEW EIGHT OF THE WHILE FAR MITIGATION PLANS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED. NOW OUR ROLE AS DIRECTED IN LAST YEAR'S SB NINE A ONE BY SENATOR DODD -- WAS TO CONSULT WITH THE C. P. U. C. AND TO BRING OUR EXPERTISE AS I MENTIONED TO BEAR DURING THEIR REVIEW PROCESS. OUT OF THE NINETEEN REQUIRED ITEMS IN EACH PLAN SEVEN OF THOSE SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE WILDFIRE RELATED ITEMS. THOSE -- ITEMS INCLUDE WILDFIRE RISK AND RISK DRIVERS ASSOCIATED WITH TYPOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE -- UTILITY PLANTS FOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT -- AND PREVENTATIVE STRATEGIES TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF LINES AND EQUIPMENT CAUSING CATASTROPHIC FIRE SO THESE SEVEN ELEMENTS REALLY WERE OUR FOCUS -- WE BROUGHT -- WITHIN OUR OWN AGENCY SPECIALIST AND FIRE RESPONSE FIRE BEHAVIOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT WILDFIRE PLANNING. FIRE PREVENTION ENFORCEMENT AND COLLECTIVELY -- THESE -- EMPLOYEES SPENT HUNDREDS OF HOURS REVIEWING THESE PLANS. NOW WHAT OUR SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS -- WHO REVIEWED AND COMMENTED UPON -- THAT THAT INFORMATION WAS THEN -- INCORPORATED INTO THE CPU SEES PROGRAM STAFF DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR PROPOSED GUIDANCE TO THE COMMISSION SO IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT THAT IN OUR REVIEWING OF THESE PLANS WITH CHEAP YOU SEE WE REALLY ACTED AS A TECHNICAL ADVISOR TO THEM. OF THE COMMISSION OBVIOUSLY MAKES THE FINAL DETERMINATION ON WHAT COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS OUGHT TO BE INCORPORATED OR REFLECTED -- IN THE FINAL PLAN. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED EARLIER IN AND KIND OF I THINK ONE OF THE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS IS YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO WITH ENFORCEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN. AND WHILE THAT IS A FUNCTION OF THE THE C. P. U. C.. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE C. P. YOU SEE -- YOU KNOW BRING IN OUR EXPERTISE TO ASSIST IN MEETING THE OVERARCHING GOAL AND AND REALLY THE UNIFIED GOAL OF REDUCING UTILITIES PARK WILDFIRES. WE'VE ALREADY SEEN AN INCREASE IN COMMUNICATION NOT JUST AMONG START TO AGENCIES BUT BETWEEN OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND MORE IMPORTANTLY -- BETWEEN US AND THE UTILITIES. ANOTHER REPORT EDITION TO THESE PLANS THAT WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING IS AN INCREASED SHARING OF DATA. AS WAS MENTIONED THERE'S A LOT OF DATA THAT THE UTILITIES ARE COLLECTING AND WE WANT TO SEE HOW WE CAN ACCESS THAT DATA USE THAT DATA. AND SHARE OUR DATA AS WELL -- FOR EXAMPLE -- LEVERAGING THE FUEL TREATMENTS PERFORMED BY UTILITIES -- IS IN A POOR ONE TO US WHEN AS WE LOOK AT WHERE WE PUT IN FUEL BREAKS IN AND AROUND COMMUNITIES WE WANT TO FIND WAYS WHERE WE CAN KIND OF COMPLEMENTARY -- TAKE THESE PROJECTS AND AND COORDINATE TO REALLY MAXIMIZE -- THE OVERALL EFFORT. SO AS I CONCLUDE I I JUST WANT TO STRESS AGAIN THERE IS NO SINGLE SILVER BULLET -- WILDFIRE MITIGATION ACTIVITY -- INCLUDING INDEPENDENTLY STOP CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES FROM OCCURRING IN CALIFORNIA -- WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO OBVIOUSLY MAKE STRIDES AT REDUCING UTILITIES PARK WILDFIRES -- BUT WE REALLY HAVE TO CONTINUE KIND OF THIS HOLISTIC APPROACH THE ALL OF THE ABOVE -- STRATEGY IN PROTECTING OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT AND OUR COMMUNITIES FROM WILDFIRES AND THE THOSE EFFORTS INCLUDE AS I MENTIONED FUEL REDUCTION AROUND COMMUNITY ENFORCING DEFENSIBLE SPACE. PLANNING COMMUNITIES THAT A RESILIENCE -- FOR WILDFIRES -- IT RESTORING OUR FORCE LANDS BACK TO THEIR NATURAL HABITAT. AND IN LISTING THE PUBLIC AS A PARTNER -- THROUGH EDUCATION SO IT REALLY HAS TO BE THIS ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I TO LOOK FOR TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL TRY TO KEEP MY COMMENTS PRETTY BRIEF HERE -- I THINK WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS JUST FOCUS IN ON A COUPLE OF THE PIECES THAT ARE IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET FOR THIS YEAR I KNOW THIS ISN'T I BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING BUT I THINK THEY'RE GONNA PROVIDE IMPORTANT INSIGHT TO A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT. JUST CAPACITY FOR THE STATE TO OVERSEE AND EVALUATE THE WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS AND KIND OF HIGHLIGHT. SOME OF THE THE KEY GAPS AND AND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM -- SO -- THERE'S A VARIETY OF POSITIONS WERE AT P. YOU SEE FOR SERVER VIEWING THAT WHILE FIRE MITIGATION PLANS BUT I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT. A TWO PIECES THAT ARE IN THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION PROPOSAL ONE AS A AS THE MS MALASHENKO MENTIONED -- THERE'S SOME CONTRACTING FUNDS ONE IS TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CONTRACTS ONE TIME TO HIRE ESSENTIALLY CONSULTANTS. OR EXCUSE THIRD PARTIES FOR MORE KIND OF BOOT BOOTS ON THE GROUND INSPECTION AND MONITORING. OF THE FUTILITY EQUIPMENT -- THIS IS -- NOT TYPICALLY -- THE WORK THAT YOU SEE HAS DONE SO FAR AND SO I THINK THIS IS KIND OF A GOOD EXAMPLE THE HIGHLIGHTS KIND OF YOU KNOW WHAT. BUT NOT IN A STATE REGULATORS ARE CURRENTLY DOING -- BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE REQUESTING RESOURCES ON JUST A ONE TIME BASIS TO HIRE -- SOME THIRD PARTY TO AT TO HELP GET THAT WORK STARTED WITH THE VISION OF THE SB NINE OH ONE ESTABLISHED A PROCESS WHERE THE UTILITIES WOULD -- CONTRACT WITH THIRD PARTIES THEMSELVES TO DO SOME OF THAT -- AUDITING INSPECTION WORK -- AND I MEAN IN OUR VIEW THE THE RIVER THE REQUEST IS REASONABLE -- BUT IT AGAIN IT KIND OF HIGHLIGHTS A GAP THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS AND FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT'S A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FROM THE LEGISLATURE'S PERSPECTIVE. IS TO MAKE SURE THE FOR THAT -- TEMPORARY FUNDING THAT THE STATE IS GETTING GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT. HOW THAT PROCESS IS INFORMING IN WHAT WORKS WHAT DOESN'T WORK YOU KNOW HOW THAT WOULD INFORM KIND OF FUTURE DECISIONS AND FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION OF OF THAT TYPE MONITORING? OF THE SECOND PIECE AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER IS -- ADDITIONAL CONTRACTING FUNDS THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR CONSULTANTS. TO HELP GUIDE THE WILDFIRE -- POLICY FUNDING IS THINKING THROUGH -- SOME OF THESE EVALUATION METRICS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED AND SNOW WHEN ABOUT WHEN OF VALUE IN THE STATE'S EVALUATING WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS -- WHAT? YOU KNOW WHAT TOOLS ARE WHAT METRICS ARE GONNA KIND OF PROVIDE THE BEST INFORMATION ON WHETHER THE OUTCOMES THAT THE STATE IS EXPECTING ARE ACTUALLY BEING ACHIEVED -- YOU KNOW HOW ARE UTILITIES DECIDING ON WHICH MITIGATION MATT MEASURES ARE DOING THE MOST. TO REDUCE THE MAXIMUM Là RISK PER DOLLAR SPENT ON SO AGAIN WE THINK YOU KNOW THAT THIS REQUEST FOR RESOURCES AGAIN IT WAS WHICH IS ONE TIME IS. REASONABLE BUT AGAIN IT IT REALLY KIND OF HIGHLIGHTS. YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE WE ARE AS A STATE AND KIND OF YOU KNOW OUR OUR NEED TO KIND OF BE THOUGHT TO PASS THE IN TRYING TO THINK ABOUT THESE ISSUES AS A PC MENTION THERE'S NOT. AND A CLEAR PLAY BOOK ON YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO REVIEW THESE AND EVALUATE THESE AND MEASURE THE OUTCOMES FROM A LOT OF THESE ACTIVITIES GOING FORWARD AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT. THE STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE ON THAT FRONT -- I DO WANT TO JUST BRIEFLY JUST MENTION REAL QUICK COMING WE WE'VE DONE A THE INITIAL REVIEW OF THE OTHER WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLANS -- THE PROPOSED PC DECISIONS IN OUR VIEW YOU KNOW ONE OF THAT THE KEY CRITICAL QUESTIONS IT AGAIN AS OUR OUR DECISIONS BEING MADE ABOUT WHICH OF THESE MITIGATION ACTIVITIES ARE REALLY. DOING -- DOING THE MOST TO REDUCE RISK WORK WE GET KIND OF THE BIGGEST BANG FOR FOR THE DOLLARS THAT WE'RE SPENDING ON REDUCING THAT RISK. AND HOW ARE WE MEASURING THOSE OUTCOMES ARE WE LOOKING AT AT SOME OF THAT THE OUTCOMES THAT. RELATED TO ACTUAL RISK REDUCTION OR ARE WE LOOKING MORE AT JUST IN PUTS INTO THE PROCESS FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW TREES TREND RATHER THAN. YOU KNOW AT A REDUCTION IN THE NATION'S OUR OVERALL RISK AND SO A LOT OF THESE BITS THESE ISSUES HAVE ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED SO FAR OF THE PC AS YOU HEARD IS VERY WELL. AWARE I THINK OF A LOT OF THESE CHALLENGES AND GAPS AND NEEDS TO KIND OF IMPROVE THE OVERSIGHT PROCESS BUT WE JUST WANNA. KINDA PROVIDE OUR OUR COMMENTS INITIAL THOUGHTS ON ON HOW THE PROCESS IS ROLLING OUT SO FAR AS WELL AS YOU KNOW WHERE SOME OF THE BUDGET REQUEST THAT INTO SOME THAT CONVERSATION SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THAT I I THINK THAT DO YOU. ALL THREE OF SERVE HIGHLIGHTED AGAIN THE CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE ALL. TIRED OF DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW AND CERTAINLY THE SPELL CHECK OR YOURS. TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE AND THE ROAD MAP AND HOW WE GET ARE WE ASKING ALL THE RIGHT QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW. AND I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. IS ON THE TABLE AND CERTAINLY WE KNOW THAT THE NINE A ONE COMMISSION MAY AND CERTAINLY THE GOVERNOR STRIKE TEAM HAS HAD SOME REFERENCE -- TO THE REGULATORY CHANGES AND AND AND WHAT MIGHT BE A NEW STRUCTURE THAT WE MIGHT ENTERTAIN OF TO GIVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF FOCUS TO SAFETY. AND CERTAINLY YOU HAVE BROUGHT TO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INSIDE AND WE RECOGNIZE TO YOUR TESTIMONY ENTER OUR REPORT TODAY THAT -- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE THESE HEARINGS AND IT'S HARD TO GET -- TESTIMONY FROM EXPERTS TO COME IN AND HELP AND GIVE YOU INPUT AND DIRECTION -- THAT MEANS THAT WE'RE SORT OF IN UNCHARTED WATERS AND THERE IS STILL SORT OF AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW. WE'RE TO MOVE FORWARD -- AGAIN FROM THE REPORT -- LOOKING ACROSS THE COUNTRY THERE'S NO OTHER STATE IN THE NATION THAT'S DEALING WITH. THE THE NATURE OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES AND ITS IMPACT AND ON THE UTILITY -- INDUSTRY AND AND THE HARDWARE IN THE EFFORT STRUCTURE THAT THE UTILITIES LINES MAKE BECAUSE IN THESE WILDFIRES IN AUSTRALIA IS PROBABLY THE ONLY PLACE I GUESS THAT COMES CLOSE TO WHERE WE CAN AT LEAST -- GET SOME TYPE OF COMPARISONS. AS SO WE ARE. IN A NEW PLACE AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MOVE FORWARD AND I THINK THAT. THE CPUC AND AND AND CERTAINLY IN YOUR LEADERSHIP ON ON SAFETY RELATED MEASURES HAS BEEN -- YOU KNOW VERY EFFECTIVE BUT WE NOW HAVE TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. HA. YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHETHER THE CPUC IS THAT PLACE GOING FORWARD OR IF WE NEED TO HOW DO WE LOOK AT A BECAUSE CREATING SOME NEW STRUCTURE HOW DOES IT CONTINUE TO INTERFACE APPROPRIATELY WITH. CAL FIRE -- JUST A YOUR THOUGHTS. THEY SEE CURRENTLY TWO MAIN -- GAPS IN THE IN THE CURRENT SIXTY CAN OF PARADIGM BUT WE HAVE SO THE FIRST GAP WAS IN THE POLICY MAKING ASPECT OF IT. TELL ME IS THAT WE ARE IN A REACTIVE MODE WE FOR THE SYSTEM WHERE WE HAVING UTILITIES COME UP WITH WELFARE MEDICATION PLANS AND THEN THE SUBMIT THEM WHEN WE REACT TO THEM RIGHT WHEN NOT DRIVING THE BUSES THE STATE. NOTED START DRIVING THE BUS AND ACTUALLY DEVELOP THE PLAN IN THE VALUATION FRAMEWORK AND FILLED THE GAPS THAT CURRENTLY EXIST WITH THERE'S NO REAL REGULATION FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S NO. STANDARD RIGHT NOW THAT SAYS WHAT WELL WHAT THE HARDENING USUALLY INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION LOOKS LIKE DELAYS HAVE OPINIONS ON AT COVERED CONDUCTOR INCREASING SPACING BETWEEN CONDUCT THERE'S A TO TREAT SUCH AS WELL WOULD TO STILL PULL REPLACEMENT. BUT THERE IS NO STANDARD LIKE IF YOU LIKE YOU HAVE AN BUILDING CODES RIGHT OF THE THAT THAT ACTUALLY EXISTS RIGHT IN ORDER TO DEVELOP THAT. THAT SEEKS RESOURCES IN THIS IS ALL VERY HIGH LEVEL. OF EXPERTISE THAT'S REQUIRED. HOME THERE ARE VERY FEW PEOPLE OUT THERE. ALL MY WHO HOW OF BOTH EXPERTISE AND WILD FIRE AND UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE SAME TIME. ALL. GLOBALLY VERY FEW OF THEM AND THEY'RE OR OLD IN HIGH DEMAND AND WORKING SOMEWHERE. AND TO BUILD THAT LEVEL OF EXPERTISE THAT SEEKS PHENOMENAL AMOUNT OF TIME SO WHETHER IT'S THE P. YOU SEE OR ANY OTHER AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA OR ANYBODY ELSE WHO DOES IT THIS WORK IS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT AND YOU NEED. TO PAY PEOPLE. WHO HALL OF ALL OF IT PLEASE VERY STRONG ANALYTICAL SKILLS AND THE LEAST SOME OF THE EXPERTISE TO BE ABLE TO KIND OF NAVIGATE THE SPACE? SO WELL -- AGAIN I'M SORRY I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT BUT HOW ARE YOUR ANALYTICAL SKILLS. I'M JUST SO YOU KNOW WE NEED WE NEED A LOT OF PEOPLE ON AS WE PUT YOU IN THE POINT IS WOEFULLY HELLO SO WHETHER IT'S A P. YOU SEE OR ITS ANY OTHER AGENCY I THANK THE WORK NEEDS TO GET DONE -- ALL MIX IT IN THE SAME THING SO THE SECOND GAP IS SORT OF THOSE BOOTS ON THE GROUND THE PC PROGRAM WAS ALWAYS DEVELOPED FILM THE TO DO OLD. AUDITS SO AND INVESTIGATIONS OF INCIDENTS ELM IT WAS NEVER TO DO INSPECTIONS AT SCALE OF UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE GROUND -- THAT KEY CAPABILITIES IS IS NOT EXISTENCE -- SO. ON THE RAIL SIDE WE ACTUALLY HAVE MORE OF A FIELD PRESENCE WHERE WE ARE INSPECTORS WALKED TRACK ELEMENT AND DO THAT KIND OF ON THE GROUND IT'LL IT'LL INSPECTION WITH EVERY MILE OF TRACKING IN CALIFORNIA. IS INSPECTED BY THE BY THE STATE PROGRAM SO WE HELP OF FORTY PEOPLE [inaudible] FOR OF FOUR THOUSAND MILES TRACK I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME BUT IN ORDER TO JUST BE ON PAR WITH THE LEVEL OF INSPECTION THAT WE DO WHAT RAIL. IT'S ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED THIRTEEN HUNDRED FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE AND IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE WILLIAM DOLLAR BUDGETS IT JUST BECAUSE OF THE LEVEL OF EXPERTISE AGAIN PLUS THE LABOR SHORTAGES THAT WE'RE HAVING. RATE SO AGAIN TO ME THE QUESTION HERE IS AN STE. BUT YOU KNOW WHICH AGENCY DOES IT'S ALL MY BUT THAT THIS GAP EXISTS AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE IT. SO SO. YOU KNOW THE THE TWO VIA SO CONTRACTING RESOURCES IN THE MAY REVISE A THING CALLED IN THE SHORT TERM. AT LEAST GET STARTED AND START GETTING MORE DATA I THINK WITH THE POLICY ASPECT YOU KNOW CAN BE DEFINITELY. HELP WE CAN MAKE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THE THREE YEAR TIME FRAME TO FILL THOSE GAPS. I THINK AS FAR AS INSPECTIONS ON THE GROUND A A THING THAT SEE HERE REAL. HELLO A LONG COMPLICATED DEBATE AS TO THE YOU KNOW THE ROLE THAT WE WANT TO PLAY AS THE STATE'S OVERSIGHT OF UTILITIES. AND HOW TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE AND HOW MUCH OF OF THIS. SORT OF IN PHYSICAL INSPECTION OF INFRASTRUCTURE WE WANT TO BE DOING THE STATE'S EMPLOYEES OR WITH THIRD PARTIES OR CONTINUING RELYING. ON UTILITIES TO DO THAT WORK AND MORE ACTING THROUGH A STRICT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS WHEN THEY'RE NOT DOING WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING [inaudible] SO. FIRST OF ALL. 21% OF THE ACREAGE IS SEEN IS CAUSED BY AN ELECTRICAL LINES. YET IT SEEMS LIKE WE'VE HAD A BAD RUN OF LUCK FOR THE UTILITIES IT SEEMS LIKE MOST OF THE DAMAGING FIRES. HAVE COME FROM THE UTILITIES PERHAPS IS JUST AROUND OF LOCKER PERHAPS IS TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE THERE'S DIFFERENT CONDITIONS. FEWER ELECTRICAL STORMS -- MORE -- MORE HIGH WINDS AND PERHAPS IT'S ALSO HARDER -- TO CONTAIN THE FIRES AGAIN BECAUSE OF GLOBAL WARMING IN PARTICULAR YOU DON'T GET DO AT NIGHT ANYMORE BECAUSE THE NIGHTS WARM UP MORE THAN THAT DAY. SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR OR MISSING THE 80% -- BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT OVER TIME YOU -- TALKING TO CAL FIRE YOU HAVE INSIDE IN THAT. THAT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WE NEED TO LOOK AT I WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD GET BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. WELL IF I COULD JUST ADD TO THAT YOU ARE CORRECT CHANGING CLIMATE ABSOLUTELY HAS A HUGE ROLE IN WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WITH THE SEVERITY OF WILDFIRES. GET IF YOU JUST COMPARE THE THE THE IT'S ALMOST DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF ACRES TO THE PERCENTAGE OF NUMBER FIRES AND OFTEN THAT'S AS I MENTIONED BECAUSE YOU HAVE WERE WE SEE THAT THESE -- UTILI SPARK FIRES OCCURRING WHEN THERE'S EXTREME WINDS NON SO IT CHANGES CLIMATE IS IS OBVIOUSLY A COMPONENT BUT I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT -- YOU KNOW THE CONDITION OF OUR FORESTS PLAYS A HUGE ROLE OF ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WHY IN SANTA ROSA IN THE THE TUBS FIRE OR EVEN GO LOOK AT THE CAMPFIRE. THE FACT THAT WE HAD A FIRE WITH SUCH INTENSITY THAT WAS ABLE TO BURN SO QUICKLY WAS NOT JUST BECAUSE OF EXTREME WIND WHICH WAS A FACTOR. BUT ALSO THE FACT THAT THE VEGETATION IS SO OVERGROWN AND THEN YOU ALLOW IT -- AFTER YEARS OF DROUGHT TO DRY OUT -- FIRES CAN RACE UP TO A COMMUNITY MUCH QUICKER AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT I REALLY STRESSED AND WE WE CONTINUE PUT A LOT OF FOCUS IN ON THESE FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS SO THAT -- YOU KNOW EAT WHEN THESE FIRES DO OCCUR BECAUSE THE THE TRUTH IS. FIRE THAT IS ALWAYS BEEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA WELL BEFORE US WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO PREVENT EVERY SINGLE FIRE AND SO WE HAVE TO PREPARE -- BUT I WOULD STRESS AGAIN CHANGING CLIMATE JUST MAKE THAT MORE DIFFICULT -- BUT AN OVERGROWN FORCED ON A HEALTHY FOREST -- ALLOWS THE INTENSITY OF THE FIRES THAT TO BECOME MUCH MORE CHALLENGING FOR US TO FIGHT YEAH. I'M ALSO VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE WE HAVE HOUSING. A PARADISE WAS KNOWN TO BE IT IS AFTER WAITING TO HAPPEN SINCE THE EIGHTIES BECAUSE IT IS AN AREA WITH. THAT TECH GETS EXTREME WINDS ARE AND ALSO THAT IT DIDN'T HAVE ACT ADEQUATE TO EXITS AND IN FACT. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE CITY ACTUALLY NARROWED SOME STREETS BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. AND THAT BECAUSE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS AS WELL THEN PEOPLE WOULD GET CAUGHT IN A CUL DE SAC AND NOT BE ABLE TO GET OUT SO. MANY PROBLEMS THERE I WISH THERE WERE A WAY WE COULD RELOCATE PARADISE [inaudible] THAT TIME. I HAVEN'T SEEN THE WAY TO DO THAT. AT ANY RATE SO -- MS MALASHENKO. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT REACTING [inaudible] AND WHAT I ASKED THE UTILITY REPRESENTATIVES WAS -- CAN YOU TELL US WHAT'S MOST COST EFFECTIVE AND IT ONLY HAS TO AVOID WONDER TWO FIRES A DECADE. AND IF IF FOR EXAMPLE UNDER GROUNDING I AGREE IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE NOT ONLY IN. THE CAPITAL TO DO WHAT THAT IN THE MAINTENANCE. BUT IF IN THE COURSE OF YOUR HIRING THESE EXPERTS AND CONSULTANTS YOU COULD TRY TO TRY TO GO -- DO SOME WORK TO DETERMINE WHAT IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE IT MAY NOT BE THE CHEAPEST THING TO DO RIGHT NOW. IT MAY VERY IN THE LONG RUN. AND I HOPE YOU CAN DO THAT ALSO THE QUESTION ABOUT THAT WE GOT FROM MISTER MERRETT SU CHI. DOES THE P. YOU SEE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT THE ANSWER IS CLEARLY. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE AND THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T HAD THAT BEFORE -- SO AGAIN I DO TH AND ALSO WE HAVE THE PRESIDENT A P. YOU SEE TALKING ABOUT THE PLACE WHERE WE REALLY. HAVE THE RESOURCES WE NEED IS ON RARE FOR HOSTS. OF THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE PLACE THAT THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS EXPERTISE AN INSPECTION IN OTHER AREAS -- NOT IN PARTICULAR IN TRUCKS AND ALL OF THAT SO -- I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN FIND THEY ARE MOST A COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO DO THIS AND YOU DON'T JUST DON'T HAVE TO REACT. TO THE THE UTILITIES PLANTS [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. WELL WE DO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A MOMENT AND TURN TO THE PUBLIC -- AND SEE IF WE HAVE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS PANEL BUT ALSO IT REFLECTING ON ANY OF THE PARTS OF THE PRESENTATION FROM THE EARLIER PANEL SO IF THERE'S ANYONE FROM THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS. THE COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME YOU'LL BE RECOGNIZED. SEEING NONE WE JUST REALLY DO APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE WE KNOW WE'RE SORT OF RIGHT AT THAT -- AT THE DOORSTEP OF SOMETHING THAT'S REQUIRED US TO USE OUR STRETCH AND TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT NEW INNOVATIVE WAYS TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGE IN FRONT OF US IN THE KNOW THAT THESE YEAR AGENCIES ARE. WORKING TOGETHER EITHER THROUGH THE FUNDING OR COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIPS -- THAT CERTAINLY HELPS AND WE'VE TAKEN A LOT OF NOTES BASED ON YOUR PRESENTATION TODAY SO IT'S OPENED UP OUR THINKING. TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ASK I THINK DOCTOR QUIRK IS. CONTINUES TO THROW THE SUGGESTION OUT THERE IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU BELIEVE AT THIS POINT REQUIRES A LEGISLATIVE ADDRESS THEN IT'S CERTAINLY -- WE'RE OPEN TO HEARING THAT AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN BEST RESPOND. BUT FOR TODAY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION. THIS MEETING IS ADJOURNED
