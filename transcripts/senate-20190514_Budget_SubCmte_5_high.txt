YEAH YEAH YEAH WE'LL GO BACK OKAY SO. WE'VE NOW ACTED ON ALL THE VOTE ONLY. WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK. TO THE BEGINNING OF THE AGENDA AND START WITH THOSE THINGS THAT WE PULLED FOR DISCUSSION. SO WE WON'T START WITH WHAT'S LISTED AS OUR DISCUSSION ITEMS BUT RATHER WE'RE GOING TO RETURN TO THOSE THINGS THAT WERE ON VOTE ONLY THAT WE PULLED FOR DISCUSSION. AND THE FIRST ITEM THAT WE PULLED FOR DISCUSSION IS UNDER -- ITEM. FIVE TWO TWO FIVE CDC ARE. AND IT IS ISSUE FIVE RIGHT SO -- THIS. ITEM IS FROM COUNSEL IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REAPPROPRIATION -- IT'S REGARDING RE APPROPRIATING. OF FOREIGNERS. FIFTEEN THOUSAND FROM PROP SIXTY THREE MONIES. FOR THAT CAMINO JUSTICE IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH THREE APPROPRIATIONS -- STAFF IF YOU WANT TO PRESENT AND THEN -- CENTER MORE LACKEY AND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS PLEASE GO AHEAD STAFF YEAH GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS ERIC SWANSON I'M THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CDC OURS OFFICE OF FISCAL SERVICES. ARE THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU IS A ONE TIME REAPPROPRIATION OF FOUR HUNDRED FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE ACT FUNDS -- THIS WAS PROVIDED IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FOURTEEN BUDGET ACT. BUT REMAINS ON SPENT WERE ASKING FOR REAPPROPRIATION TO SPEND IT IN BUDGET WE YEAR. WITH ME TODAY IS STEPHANIE WELCH WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE C. C. G. BEACH AREA. AND SHE CAN DESCRIBE WHAT THOSE FUNDS WILL BE USED. FOR THANK YOU -- LAST YEAR WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO RECEIVE THESE FUNDS AS PART OF THE BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS -- AND THE PURPOSE OF THE FUNDS IS FOR US TO DEVELOP A COMPETITIVE -- PROCESS WHERE PEOPLE CAN BID FOR CONTRACT -- FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF EMPOWERING PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN FORMALLY INCARCERATED AND LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS TO PROVIDE INPUT INTO. HOW TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICES SO FOR EXAMPLE WHILE WE HAVE? SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE HEARD SO FAR. THAT ARE NEEDED WOULD BE A FROM THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE OF OF FOR THE FROM THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL ILLNESS. A GROUP THAT REPRESENTS FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOVED ONES WHO HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR MORE TRAINING FOR FAMILIES IS TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN THEIR LOVED ONE IS ARRESTED. SO FOR EXAMPLE THEY COULD BID ON A POTENTIAL CONTRACT THAT WOULD DEVELOP A TOOL KIT TO HELP THESE FAMILIES STATEWIDE. BECAUSE THESE ARE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT DOLLARS IN THIS CONTRACT HAS NEVER EXISTED BEFORE AND IN FACT THERE ISN'T CURRENTLY A CONTRACT LIKE THIS PARTICULARLY TARGETING PEOPLE WITH -- FORMAL FORMER JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT WE FELT IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT WHICH IS TO HAVE A VERY ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. TO THE FUNDS THAT WE HAVE USED DURING CURRENT YEAR. HAVE LAUNCHED A STATEWIDE A STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS THAT PROCESS -- BEGAN WITH A JUVENILE JUSTICE ROUNDTABLE AND CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER WITH LISTENING SESSIONS AROUND THE STATE. CAN FORM INTERVIEWS AS WELLAS FOCUS GROUPS THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO HEAR FROM THE COMMUNITY AS TO HOW WE SHOULD MOST THOUGHTFULLY EXPENDITURES FUNDS -- IT IS A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY ON AN ON AN ONGOING BASIS IT'S ABOUT A SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS STATE WIDE TO COVER ISSUES -- THAT ARE FOR CHILDREN YOUTH ADULTS SIX ADDRESS WE FEEL IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO HEAR FROM THE COMMUNITY AS TO HOW THEY WANTED US TO STRUCTURE. THE CONTRACTS DID THEY WANT AS THE STRUCTURE. THE CONTRACTS AT ON A REGIONAL BASIS DID THEY WANT THEM TO BE A SPECIFIC TO CERTAIN TARGET POPULATIONS THAT HAVE HIGH NEEDS FOR EXAMPLE IN OUR ROUND TABLE A FEW WEEKS AGO WE HEARD THAT. CHILDREN WHO HAVE PARENTS ARE INCARCERATED HAVE A PARTICULAR HIGH NEED. SO THAT'S REALLY THE PURPOSE OF RIGHT NOW AND SO WE FELT WE WANTED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAD A ROBUST PROCESS AND OF COURSE -- WE APPROPRIATE THE FUNDS FOR THE FUTURE YEARS SAID THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO AWARD. ABOUT ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN CONTRACTS IN THE FIRST YEAR. SO I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE -- MORE LOOK. WHICH THE MONEY WAS NOT SPENT SO. THIS DOES THAT MEAN THAT IF YOU DIDN'T SPEND IT YOU LOSE IT. AT THAT IS CORRECT THE MONEY WOULD REVERT TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUN. HERE SO I DIDN'T GO INTO RESERVE. NO THOUGH THAT -- THESE ARE STATE ADMIN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THROUGH A REAPPROPRIATION YOU'RE YOU'RE GONNA TRY IT AGAIN. ARE YOU GONNA SPEND IT THIS YEAR. YES WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO PUT THE MONEY OUT FOR BID SO NORMALLY WE WOULD ONLY HAVE SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO PUT OUT TO BID IN A COMPETITIVE PROCESS. FOR THE FIRST YEAR WHICH WE INTEND TO HAVE A THREE YEAR CONTRACTS WE'LL BE ABLE TO PUT OUT TO BID ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS. SO THAT'S HOW WE INTEND TO SPEND THE MONEY NEXT YEAR JUST JUST A I'M SORRY -- JUST ONE MORE THING I THINK WHAT'S HARD ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND IN SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT COME UP LATE IN THE BUDGET ACT AS WE DIDN'T HAVE SORT OF MONTHS TO PLAN AHEAD HOW -- TO HOW -- TO DO A COMPETITIVE BID FOR THESE GRANTS IT WAS SORT OF A LAST MINUTE ADD TO THE BUDGET ACT AND THAT'S WHY THERE WAS A DELAY IN. GETTING ALL THE FUNDING OW OKAY SO THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY. THEY DIDN'T GET ACCOMPLISHED BEFORE THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR -- YOU'RE EXPECTING YOU YOU'RE CALLING IT A ONE TIME BUT YOU WILL YOU HOPE TO GET IT FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS AS WELL SO YOU'RE SAYING. OF THESE ARE ONGOING FUNDS AND SO -- WE INTEND TO FOLLOW A SIMILAR PROCESS THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY HAS FOLLOWED WITH THEIR STAKEHOLDER CONTRACTS THAT THEY EXECUTE FIRST FOR SPECIAL POPULATIONS LIKE VETERANS GROUPS. WHICH IS -- TO ISSUE THREE YEAR CONTRACTS AND THEN ASSESS HOW THOSE CONTRACTS WENT USING OUR OUR STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT WE'VE BUILT A LOOK AT THE OUTCOMES OF THOSE. POTENTIALLY PRIORITIES WILL SHIFT THE COMMUNITY MAY IDENTIFY THAT THE NEEDS OF OF OF CHILDREN WHO HAVE INCARCERATED PARENTS IS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY FOR THE FIRST YEAR. FIRST THREE YEARS OF CONTRACTS BUT MAY DETERMINE THAT SOME OTHER PRIORITY IS HOW WE SHOULD PUT OUT AN RFP THREE YEARS FROM NOW. SO FOR EXAMPLE MAYBE THE PRIORITY THREE YEARS FROM NOW WOULD BE TO REALLY FOCUS ON RECEIVING OF BIDS FROM. RE ENTRY COUNCILS TO TRY TO WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE FORMALLY INCARCERATED TO HELP THEM BETTER ACCESS LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SO THIS IS GOOD FOR ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. THAT IS REALLY PART OF THE COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AGAIN -- I THINK HOW WE HAVE SEEN IT BE -- ISSUED IN THE PASS THROUGH THE THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION HAS BEEN USUALLY ONE STATE Y. CONTRACT. WITH MULTIPLE SMALLER REGIONAL CONTRACTS SO THAT -- THAT THERE CAN BE A FOCUSED EFFORT IN SMALLER PORTIONS OF THE STATE IS IT ENOUGH MONEY. I WOULD SAY THAT IT'S A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF FUNDS FOR A VERY LARGE PROBLEM SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DISCUSSED LAST TIME I WAS HERE. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE INTEND TO DO WITH OUR STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IS ISSUE THREE DIFFERENT REPORTS. THOSE REPORTS WILL BE PROVIDED TO YOU -- SUMMARIZING THE CONTENT OF EVERYTHING THAT WE HEARD -- AND I EXPECT THAT WHAT WE MIGHT HEAR THROUGH THE PROCESS IS THAT THERE IS A HIGHER NEED AND THAT THERE'S MORE INTEREST FOR RESOURCES FOR THIS WORK. BOB -- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING TO HELP A LARGE LAW AND YOU KNOW THE THE COUNTY SET UPS ELECTED TO DO THAT MAYBE TWENTY OF THE FIFTY EIGHT BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THIS WOULD DOVETAIL REALLY WELL. WITH THOSE COUNTIES THAT ARE READY. YOU KNOW UTILIZING FLOORS LATIMES. I'M JUST CURIOUS ONE HAVE YOU RECEIVED ANY OPPOSITION FROM -- THE MIDDLE HEALTH COMMUNITY AND THEY HAVE DATE IS FILED LAWSUITS TO PREVENT THIS KIND OF FUNDING OR WAS DISAPPROVED BY THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE THAT CENTER BELL. SITS ON WE'VE. WE'VE -- EXPERIENCED A LOT OF SUPPORT -- WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS. IT'S THAT SKEWS ME AT SEVERAL OF OUR COUNCIL. MEETINGS OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR AND WE HAVE. A WORKING GROUP OF A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS -- THAT ARE GOING TO BE GUIDING THE PROCESS AND SO ACTUALLY THIS IS BEEN -- AT TREMENDOUSLY SUPPORTED BY A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT ADVOCACY GROUPS PARTICULARLY ONES THAT ARE NEW -- TO TO THE MENTAL HEALTH COMMUNITY IN THE EXCITING PART ABOUT THIS PROJECT IS GOING TO BRING TOGETHER. THE ADVOCATES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE FORMALLY INCARCERATED AND THE ADVOCATES FOR PEOPLE WHO -- HELP PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS TO WORK TOGETHER COLLABORATE A COLLABORATIVE LEE ON MAYBE. TOGETHER A PROPOSAL FOR RESOURCES. BY I'M GOING TO BEG FOR MY COUNTY LEVEL GRANTS BUT MY MAIN JAIL WAS THE LARGEST MENTAL AND MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTE IN THE COUNTY. OF ORANGE. AND I'M JUST WONDERING -- COLLEAGUES AT THIS IS ENOUGH THAT. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF STATE INMATES HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS I WOULD ASSUME IT'S A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF WEEKS. TRY TO FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS. AND TO WORK WITH FAMILIES -- AND IF THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT IS WILLING TO PROVIDE FUNDING IN THIS THIS AREA YOU'RE GETTING SUPPORT. WHY AREN'T YOU ASKING FOR MORE? I THINK THAT WE WANT TO PROVE THAT WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL -- AT I KNOW I KNOW THAT LAST TIME I WAS HERE THERE WERE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT -- YOU KNOW WE ARE SMALL COUNCIL AND WE ARE CURRENTLY STAFF TO FOR POSITIONS. I THINK WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO DO REALLY GOOD WORK WITH THIS BUT AS I MENTIONED BEFORE PART OF THE THE DESIRE TO SPEND THE MONEY ON A REALLY ROBUST STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND TO PRODUCE THESE REPORTS THIS SO THAT I CAN PROVIDE. TO YOU -- DOCUMENTATION OF THE NEED AND THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT THINGS I THINK WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE COMMUNITY -- AND THEN YOU ALL CAN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDING TO SOLVE THOSE PROBLEMS THAT THEY'VE IDENTIFIED WHETHER IT'S MY COUNSEL OR SOMEBODY ELSE WHO. WHO ISSUES THOSE THOSE FUNDS THAT'S TO ME NOT IMPORTANT I THINK THE THE THE THE BEST THING THAT COULD COME OUT OF THAT PROCESS WOULD BE -- KEY INFORMATION TO ALL OF YOU FROM FOLKS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA -- AS TO WHAT THEY NEED RESOURCES FOR SO IF YOU DECIDE TO GET THOSE FUNDS. TO THE B. SEC TO ADMINISTER OR TO THE COUNTIES TO ADMINISTER OR FOR THE COUNCIL TO ADMINISTER THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN REVISIT AFTER THE FIRST YEAR OF THIS PROJECT WE EXPECT ALL OF THOSE REPORTS TO BE -- COMPLETE BY THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR. WELL MISS WELL TRIED I'D SAY GO BIG GO BOLD -- THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. PROVIDED AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF ROOM RESOURCES BUT IT THERE LANGUISHING THEY'RE JUST SITTING IN BANK ACCOUNTS AND I'D LOVE TO SEE. A LITTLE BIT MORE GO INTO THIS DIRECTION WHERE IT'S REALLY NEEDED -- TO ALL MAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE ITEM MADAM CHAIR BUT CAN I DOUBLE HEADER TRIPLET AT ON THE FLOOR HERE. LIMON MAY I ASK A FEW QUESTIONS AND THEN. TO A MISS WELSH BY HADN'T INTENDED TO BEFORE BUT I SINCE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU RAISED IT. REMINDING ME OF THE DISCUSSION WHEN WE HAD THE ITEM PREVIOUSLY. AND THE PRESSURE WILL GIVE YOU PERMISSION TO ASK MISS WELSH QUESTIONS THANK YOU [inaudible] SO THIS. AT LEAST APPROPRIATION IS -- PRIMARILY FOR RESEARCH CORRECT. TO DO VERSUS DIRECT DELIVERY OF SERVICES. NOT THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT THIS IS ACTUALLY TO DEVELOP A COMPETITIVE BID PROCESS OKAY AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A COMPETITIVEBRIDGE PROCESS. TO FOR THE END RESULT BEING THE END RESULT BEING A POTENTIALLY COULD BE DIRECT SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE THE EXACT -- THE EXAMPLE I GAVE YOU ABOUT -- CHILDREN WHO HAVE INCARCERATED PARENTS WERE LOOKING FOR PEER MENTORS OR IT COULD BE FOR AN ORGANIZATION TO DO MORE ADVOCACY SO FOR EXAMPLE SOMETHING WE'VE HEARD FROM RE ENTRY COUNCILS. IS THAT THEY'RE REALLY INTERESTED IN BEING A TRAIN TO GO AND TALK TO THEIR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. ABOUT A DIFFERENT SERVICES THAT THEY WANT. TO THROUGH THEY PRESENT TO US AND THAT'S PART OF THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WE REALLY WILL HAVE A SERIES ABOUT THIRTY DIFFERENT QUESTIONS WE WANT TO ASK THE COMMUNITY. IN TERMS OF OF WHAT SHOULD BE THE PRIORITY SHOULD THE PRIORITY BE TRYING TO DELIVER A SERVICE SHOULD THE PRIORITY TO BE TO DELIVER AN A PRODUCT LIKE A TOOL KIT. SHOULD IT BE ACE OF AN ONGOING SERVICE LIKE A CRISIS LINE FOR AS WE FR THIS TO A CRISIS LINE THAT PARENTS CAN CALL WHEN THEIR CHILD IS -- ARRESTED AND THAT'S REALLY FOR THE COMMUNITY TO TELL US AND AND WE WILL BRING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS TO OUR BOARD AND IN NOVEMBER THE BOARD WILL DETERMINE. HOW THEY WANT TO STRUCTURE THOSE ARE OF PEAS THEY MAY DETERMINE BASED ON EVERYTHING WE HERE IN THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY ONLY WANT TO ISSUE -- A COMPETITIVE PROCESS. FOR I KEEP BRINGING THIS UP BUT CHILDREN WHO HAVE INCARCERATED PARENTS. WHO NEED SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE IDENTIFIED THROUGH THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AS WELL AS THE RESEARCH PROCESS WHEN I SEE RESEARCH LITERATURE REVIEW KEY INFORMANT INTO INTERVIEWS WITH EXPERTS FOCUS GROUPS -- THAT THAT IS SUCH AN UNMET NEED THAT IT IS THE BIGGEST PRIORITY FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF THESE FUNDS. THE ALLOCATION TODAY IS TO DEVELOP THAT OUR P. NOT% NECESSARILY DEFINED [inaudible] THE WHATEVER ACTIVITY. ACTUALLY IT IS TO FUND THE ACTIVITY AND THE THE FUNDS THAT WE HAVE USED THIS YEAR SO FAR HAVE SUPPORTED THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS WE'RE ABLE TO CARRY SOME OF THOSE DELIVERABLES INTO AN OVER THE SUMMER AND OF COURSE WERE RIGHT IN OUR OF P. OURSELVES -- IN IT AS PART OF MY TEAM AND SO THIS REAPPROPRIATION WILL GO DIRECTLY INTO CONTRACTS. THEN IN THE AS FAR AS I CAN TELL FROM THE DISCUSSION SO FAR. THE THE SERVICES AND THE DATA GATHERING I'D SAY OUR RESEARCH IS [inaudible] ON FOLKS WHO ARE ALREADY OUT OF THE SYSTEM THEY MIGHT BE ON PAROLE BUT THEY'RE NOT. IN MAKES HOUSE TO NOW IN IN ONE OF OUR FACILITIES [inaudible] CORRECT OR TO BE HONEST WE WERE THIS WAS NOT A B. C. P. -- AND SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE REALLY WANT TO ASK WHEN I SAY IT WAS AN A B. C. P. THERE WAS AN TO M.. WE WERE LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE AWARDED THESE FUNDS LAST YEAR AS PART OF BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS -- AND SO THAT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO ASK THERE WAS NO DIRECTION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT IT SHOULD BE. FOR INDIVIDUALS ONLY WHO OF ALREADY EXITED INCARCERATION AND OR ONLY INDIVIDUALS INSIDE WHO ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING INCARCERATION I THINK IT WOULD BE A CRITICAL ISSUE TO ASK THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE BOTH ARE REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES -- BUT AGAIN. I FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE INCLUDING THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA SHOULD TELL THE COUNCIL WHAT IS THE PRIORITY IF IT'S PEOPLE WHO ARE HOME. WHO'VE BEEN INCARCERATED OR WHO ARE GREAT RISK OF RE INCARCERATION OR EVEN INITIAL INCARCERATION OF VERSUS PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE EXPERIENCING PERSPIRATION. I RAISE THE QUESTION BECAUSE WE BROUGHT THIS UP IN THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION BUT IT'S MORE ROOM. TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS REALLY HOUSE IN CDC ARE. IF IT'S IF WERE FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON THE FOLKS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN A STATE FACILITY. THEN THERE IS THERE SOME LOGIC TO IT BEING IN CDC ARE IF IT'S PEOPLE WHO ARE. EITHER FAMILIES -- FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY -- WHO ARE NO LONGER MAYBE UNDER PAROLE BUT NO LONGER IN A STATE FACILITY THEN IT SEEMS LIKE THE ACTIVITY MAY BE BETTER HOUSE? NOT WITHIN CDC ARE. ONE OF THE THINGS I I THINK I'VE NEGLECTED TO DO WHEN I WAS HERE LAST TIME WAS TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ABOUT WHO MY COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE. I KNOW WE SPOKE ABOUT -- YOU KNOW MY KIND OF DIRECT CHAIN OF COMMAND BUT I ALSO -- WORK FOR MY COUNCIL MEMBERS MY COUNCIL MEMBERS REPRESENT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT LOCAL EXPERTS -- BETWEEN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS SO COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTORS PROBATION CHIEFS -- COURT JUDGES -- PEOPLE WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE IN THE MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. AND SO IT WE REALLY OPERATE -- OUTSIDE OF THE STRUCTURE OF WHAT IS CONSIDERED THE FOCUS OF THE TARGET POPULATION OF CDC ARE -- AND WE SPEND OUR TIME WORKING WITH VARIOUS DIFFERENT GROUPS AND DEVELOPING RELATIONSHIPS WITH LIKE THE COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF OUR SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION -- AND THAT REALLY IS WHERE WE SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF OUR TIME WE ALSO HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS. REPRESENTED HONOR COUNCIL -- AND SO WE DO A LOT OF PROJECTS WITH THEM DIRECTLY -- SO. I THINK I NEGLECTED TO EXPLAIN THAT -- WHEN I WAS HERE LAST TIME -- WELL THE SECRETARY OF CDC OUR IS OUR CHAIR -- IT IS THE WHOLE COUNCIL THAT MAKES DECISIONS ABOUT. WHERE WE SPEND OUR TIME AND ENERGY WHAT ISSUES WE SHOULD FOCUS ON X. ADDRESS -- I APPRECIATE MY COLLEAGUE VICE CHAIR SENTIMENT ABOUT -- THAT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE NEEDS THAT POTENTIALLY COULD DESERVE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. I WOULD BE HESITANT TO DO SO YES WITHOUT -- SOME CLARITY AS TO WHAT TIME [inaudible] IT. WHAT DIRECTION WE GIVE IT WHAT OBJECTIVES -- BUT I THINK. IN THIS MAY BE SOMETHING WHY. COLLEAGUES ARE WILLING DURING THE INTERIM THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO HAVE. AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING ABOUT BECAUSE I THINK MOST OF S REALIZE THAT [inaudible] TEARS -- THAT HAVING A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH. MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. IN OUR STATE PRISONS AND WHO ARE THEY ARE PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF LACK OF SIFT AT APPROPRIATE TREATMENT FOR THEIR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. IS NOT A BENEFIT TO EITHER A PRISON -- SYSTEM OR TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AND THAT IF. GETTING SMARTER ABOUT THAT. IS -- WOULD BENEFIT EVERYONE ALL CALIFORNIA. AND WE WE'VE DONE SOME BUT NOT A LOT. SO [inaudible] MAYBE WILL. I WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION YOU MADE WILL ACT ON THIS AND IF -- WE WILL HAVE TO DECIDE TODAY BUT MY COLLEAGUES ARE INTERESTED MAKE ABOUT HAVING -- SOME INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS IN THE INTRO. YEAH WE WOULD BE. THRILLED TO HELP PUT THAT ON CENTERVILLE [inaudible] SO -- THE HEALTH SERVICES ACKERMAN THE COMMISSION I KNOW THE PROCESS YOU'RE GOING TO GET A THREE YEAR THIS A THREE YEAR. PROPOSAL WITH -- RENEWABLES IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT. AND THEY HAVE A PERFORMANCE EVALUATION PROCESS. IT'S PRETTY STANDARD YOU KNOW SO YOU KNOW WHICH ARE YOU HAVE. TO CHAU WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO REAP WHAT THE RESULTS ARE GOING TO BE -- AND THAT'S ALL PART OF YOUR APPLICATION WHEN YOU ORIGINALLY APPLIED FOR THIS RIGHT. SO -- YOU YOU -- THE MONEY IS HANDLED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS THE QUESTION I WOULD HAVE IS. HOW MUCH MONEY FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- X.. DOES THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTION GET AND WORLD SERIES SPENDING THAT MONEY. TO SPEND ANY MONEY FROM -- IN YOU GET MONEY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF OR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT. OTHER IN THIS PARTICULAR BRAND OR OTHER MONEY SPENT ON THANKS LEAVE THAT THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE WE SPENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING PROP SIXTY THREE THIS IS THE ACTUALLY WE THE COUNCIL ARE THE ONLY. ENTITY WITHIN CDC ARE THAT RECEIVES ANY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING WE DO RECEIVE SOME ADDITIONAL MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING FOR OF FOR A POSITION FOR A RESEARCHER. AND THAT IS FOR A MEDICAL UTILIZATION PROJECT WITH DH CS WE WE LOOK AT HOW PEOPLE EXITING INCARCERATIONS SPECIFICALLY CDC ARE UTILIZED THEIR MEDI CAL BENEFITS -- AND THAT IS OF FUNDED BY THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT AND SO -- WE WE ARE LAUNCHING INTO OUR NEXT YEAR OF RESEARCH WITH THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT AND WE'LL BE FOCUSING ON SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT I KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE A SUBJECT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW SO YOU. WE'LL BE LOOKING AT HOW I WILL DEVELOP A BASS LINE AND THEN WE WILL START LOOKING AT HOW PEOPLE LEADING CDC ARE UTILIZED THEIR SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT BENEFIT IN THE COMMUNITY. YEAH OKAY. BY TAKE A THINKER ON FOR I GET OUT OF THIS YOUR YOUR PUNCH THE KIND OF CONTRACTS. THE MONEY WILL GO TO WILL BE. HI THERE APPEARS SO POOR SYSTEMS SO TO HELP WITH -- PEOPLE. IN A TRANSITION AND MAYBE -- HAVE OTHER GOALS LIKE. ONE OF I I KNOW ONE OF THE BIG GOALS -- IN THE MIDDLE HEALTH SERVICES ACT. FOR PEOPLE INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. RE CONNECTION WITH THEIR FAMILIES. AND FAMILY -- UNIFICATION TRYING TO KEEP THE PERSON CONNECTED WITH THE FAMILY SO THEY HAVE. A SUPPORT SYSTEM WHEN THEY LEAVE. IF THIS SPECIALLY IF THEY HAVE A SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE CONNECTION SO -- HAVING THE PIER HERE KIND OF SUPPORT [inaudible] PROGRAMS -- IS WORD OTHER PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES HAVE DONE FOR THAT -- AND A SURPLUS KIND OF PROGRAM SO. GENERALLY -- SIR MORE LAX CORRECT IN THAT THIS IS. WE'RE TO TRY THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE THERE'S ALREADY A BILL TO AND PERFORMANCE MONITORING. GOT A REPORT BACK SYSTEM. ON THE EXPENDITURE OF OF THE BILL HELPS SERVICE DOLLARS FOR THOSE SO. IF YOU'RE INTERESTED WE COULD. TALK ABOUT THAT IN THE FUTURE. AFTER THEY GET STARTED OR IF YOU WANTED TO YOU KNOW. HELLO THIS -- I'M LOOKING AT THE DOLLAR AMOUNT YOU'RE NOT GOING. TO YOUR SUPPORT PROGRAMS AREN'T THAT EXPENSIVE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CAN BE -- COVERD WITH THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY. MAN I WRITE WITH A PROBABLY WOULD THINK THAT'S KIND OF A THE SLIM. THEN -- BUDGET FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IT COULD BE LIKE LOOKED AT AS A MORE OF CAIRO A PHASE IN KIND OF THING. YOU ARE LOOKING THAT WAY MORE OF A MULTI YEAR PHASE AND YOU WANTED THESE KIND OF PROGRAMS -- CONNECTION WITH FAMILY IN TERMS OF MIL ILLNESS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST THINGS YOU CAN DO. TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM. WITH MEL MENTALLY ILL OFFENDERS IS TO HAVE SOMEBODY THERE TO HELP THEM. RATHER THAN HAVING THE HOMELESS. AND THAT'S WHERE ARE HOMELESS POPULATION COMES FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOMEBODY IN THE THEY BECOME HOMELESS CHANNELS SO. THE NAME RE A FAN AND THEN THEY GET INTO THE SYSTEM AGAIN. THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT KIND OF RECYCLE OVER AND OVER. SO I THINK I THINK -- LOOK INTO THIS OF THAT WAY WOULD BE. APPROPRIATE I DON'T KNOW. HOW WE WANT TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE BUT I THINK IT'S A IT'S TO ME IT SERVICE -- CONCEPT IT'S BEEN USE OTHER PLACES THAT SIMPLY IS SUCCESSFUL. BUT I DON'T KNOW IF. THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE HAVING HERE IS REALLY GOOD -- SCRATCH THE SURFACE OR MAKE A BIG IMPACT I DON'T KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO TARGET THIS MONEY SOMEWHERE. A LITTLE BIT. SO THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS. CENTER MORE LUCK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- I'M. I'M NOT A A PRE MED MAJOR I WAS BUSINESS MAJOR -- BUT IN ORANGE COUNTY WHEN I WAS SUPERVISOR WE HAD. THE SCHIZOPHRENIC HOMELESS YOUNG MAN -- TRAGICALLY KILLED. OUT IN A POLICING COUNTER. AND IT WAS IRONIC BECAUSE HIS FATHER WAS A POLICE OFFICER TO AND IT WAS. A BIG. A BIG DEAL KELLY THOMAS SORT OF BECAME. I BECAUSE FOR ME TO DO A LOT MORE RESEARCH ON MENTAL HEALTH. AND LAWRENCE Là IN GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH GERALD STEINBERG AND DOING SB FIVE EIGHTY FIVE IN. TRYING TO GET SOME FUNDING FOR THAT AND AND SO I'M NOT UP TO THE LEVEL OF A KNOWLEDGE SAID SENATOR BELL IS AS THE CHAIRMAN OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH CAUCUS -- BUT I'M TRYING A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME AND AND RIGHT NOW I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE LETTERMAN PETROUS ACT SHORT ACT LETTERMAN LPS. AND IN THE MORE I READ THE MORE DISAPPOINTED AND WORRIED I AM -- IT SEEMS TO HAVE -- NOT BEEN THE RIGHT SOLUTION BY TAKING SO MANY. INDIVIDUALS OUT OF INSTITUTIONS IN THE LATE SEVENTIES. IT WAS A BILL THAT WAS A DEMOCRAT BILL BUT IT WAS SIGNED BY RONALD REAGAN. BUT THESE INDIVIDUALS REMOVED OUT OF THE INSTITUTIONS AND THEY WENT TO THE STREETS AND THEN THEY WENT. AND BECAME INCARCERATED SO NOW THEY YOUR WE'RE TAKING CARE OF THEM IN A DIFFERENT. INSTITUTION AND SO. I I WHEN I WHEN I SAW THIS ITEM I I THOUGHT THIS IS GREAT REFUSING SOME OF THE IMAGE AS A FUNDING. FOR THOSE ARE INCARCERATED OR RELATED TO THOSE ARE INCARCERATED PARENTS CERTAINLY NEED SUPPORT GROUPS. AS WELL WHEN YOU KNOW YOU JUST NEED ONE FRIEND IS A I WAS DRIVING DOWN TESTABLE OF ART I SAW MY DAUGHTER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN TWO YEARS. YOU KNOW YOU START TO REALIZE THIS GUY'S A DOCTOR. IN ANSWER ALL MY GOODNESS. WHAT'S GOING ON IF YOU START TO APPRECIATE THAT FAMILIES NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON AS WELL AND AND SO. MAYBE YOU HAVE THE NOSE UNDER THE TENT I WAS KIND OF SAN I'D LIKE TO GET THE WHOLE CAMEL. INTO THAT. TEN BECAUSE THIS IS FOR THE REAL MEAT IS IN THAT AND SOMEHOW WE CAN GET THE MAP MHSAA -- TO TO HELP IN THIS AREA YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE. YOU'RE TAKING CARE OF SO MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AND I'M. SO FOR THE PHASE IN IS FINE BUT THE NEED IS NOW -- I'VE A A I CAN GO THROUGH A DAY WITHOUT SOMEONE TALKING ABOUT THE HOMELESS SITUATION. A LAST NIGHT I WAS WATCHING THE NEWS HERE LOCALLY IN SOMEONE FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY SAID YEAH WE HAD A MAJOR CORPORATION I WAS GONNA MOVE TO SACRAMENTO. AND THEN THEY SAID ONE NIGHT HAVE IT'S GOING TO A KINGS GAME. THEY WENT TO THE KINGS GAME AND THEN WHEN THEY LEFT THIS ALL THESE HOMELESS PEOPLE WALKING AROUND THEY SAID. WE CAN PUT OUR COMPANY HERE THE FACT. THAT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME EVER TO STORY OF THAT NATURE. SO AS TO THERE'S A WE'VE GOT A WE GOT TO GET MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH MHSAA -- AND SO I'D LOVE TO DO A HEARING I'D LOVE. TO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO AN AUDIT ON THE L. P. -- AS A THE ACTIVE YOUNG I'M I'M I'M NOT HAPPY WITH WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY OWN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH I'M NOT WHAT I'M FINDING IS VERY DISTURBING AND AND AND I'M GOING BACK TO THE LATE SEVENTIES EIGHTIES -- AND AND SO THERE'S A LOT WE CAN DO AND THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME DUMP IT ALL ON YOUR PLATE. MADAM CHAIR -- BUT THAT'S WHY OUR PROGRAM INTRIGUED BY THIS ITEM THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME PULL IT AND THANK YOU. FOR LET ME TRY. TO DOUBLE IT UP [inaudible] TOTALLY. SENATOR BILL I THINK IT'S WORTH MORE DISCUSSION AND ALSO ON THIS COMMITTEE -- GROUPS ARE MORE LIKE -- THE MIDDLE ILL. PART OF THE CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT IS ONE OF THEBIGGEST COST DRIVERS IN OUR BUDGET INCREASE IN THIS. AREA SO. SINCE IT IS SUCH A HUGE COST DRIVER IN TERMS OF THE COST OF PROVIDING -- CRIMINAL JUSTICE SERVICES CENTER CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT. IT SHOULD BE ONE OF THE MAIN FOCUSES OF THIS COMMITTEE. MY OPINION BECAUSE IT IS COSTING IT THE BUDGET INCREASES. WELL IN ANSWER WHY ARE WE HAVING INCREASES WHEN THE POPULATION OF THE INMATE POPULATION IS EITHER STABLE OR GOING DOWN. WELLS BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER NUMBERS OF PEOPLE THAT REQUIRE. TREATMENT -- YOU KNOW OTHER FACTORS LIKE AGING BUT WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT A FEW MINUTES BUT YOU KNOW. THE MENTAL ILLNESS PART HAS NEVER BEEN. IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY ANALYZE IN TERMS OF HOW WHAT KIND OF ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE. TO ATTACK THE COST DRIVERS THAT WE HAVE HERE THE COST INCREASED DRIVER. YOUR YOU HAVE TO GO AFTER THOSE POSH DRIVERS. FIND OUT WHAT YOU CAN DO. SO FROM OF THEY JUST DID A SURVEY AND THEY FOUND THAT. CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAS THE MOST -- BEING BILLIONAIRES PER PER CAPITA. AND SO THE MILLIONAIRES AND MY DISTRICT OR SAND WHAT AM I GETTING FOR MY 1%. BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE BILLIONAIRE'S SAM CISCO ARE SAYING BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO HAVE APPS. TO FIGURE OUT WHERE NOT TO WALK. YOU KNOW SO. WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING. I THINK I THINK WE NEED TO NOT BE DOING PHASE INS WE NEED TO BE DOING [inaudible] YOU KNOW. AND IF THE THE THE PROP SIXTY THREE OR IF WITH ALL THE IPOS ARE GOING THIS YEAR IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO MAYBE HAVE A LITTLE. BUMPER CROP SO WE SHOULD BE FIGURING OUT QUICKLY WHAT TO DO WITH THOSE FUNDS. SO ARE VERY. THIS WAS A IMPORTANT WILL NEED A DISCUSSION. WELL IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY. GIVE US A ROADMAP YET WE CERTAINLY -- CAN GIVE IT MORE TIME WHEN WE'RE NOT UNDER THE CONSTITUTIONAL PRESSURE OF ADOPTED THE BUDGET BY JUNE FIFTEENTH BUT ALL TAKE THE MOTION NOW TO PROOF AS BUDGETED AS SENATOR MORE LACK. HAVE MADE AND WE WILL. DEFINITELY -- FIGURE OUT. NEXT STEPS WHEN WE ARE PASS THIS PERIOD. OKAY SO LET'S HAVE A ROLL CALL. CENTER SKINNER BY SENATOR MORLOCK SENATOR BELL OKAY. THAT -- ITEM THAT ISSUE FIVE IS APPROVED AND WE WILL NOW. GO -- TO ISSUE. SEVEN AND THAT IS UNDER AGAIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION IT IS THE RECEIVERS. MEDICAL CLASSIFICATION MODEL UPDATE. AND IT IS -- TO APPROPRIATE -- TWENTY SEVEN POINT NINE MILLION. AND A HUNDRED AND TWO POSITIONS IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TO INCREASE STAFFING LEVELS FOR HEALTH CARE OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA'S PRISON SYSTEM. WE HAVE OUR RECEIVER HERE AND SOME OTHER FOLKS WE INTRODUCE YOURSELVES YOU CAN PERCENT THE ITEM. GOOD MORNING -- SYSTEM TO BE DIRECTED TO WIN READER FOR C. CCS -- I ALSO HAVE -- PART COUNCIL RECEIVER IN MY HAND WITH ME DOCTOR WHEN THEY CAME IN ON THE ITEM NUMBER -- SEVEN THIS IS -- AN ITEM THAT REFLECTS AN UPDATE TO THE MODEL THAT WE USE -- OF FOR DETERMINING NUMBER OF MEDICAL POSITIONS -- IT IS A MODEL THAT WAS INITIALLY ADOPTED ABOUT FIVE OR SIX YEARS AGO. I'M WORRIED TRYING TO BE A MODEL OUR STAFFING BASED UPON THE ACUITY LEVEL OF OUR A PATIENT POPULATION -- WE HAVE SINCE THEM ON HAVE. I'M MORE EXPERIENCE WITH -- HOW WELL THAT MODEL HAS WORKED ON SOME OF ITS SHORTCOMINGS -- WE'VE LEARNED MORE FROM HAVING THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD THAT IS HELP US BETTER UNDERSTAND. OF THE NEEDS OF OUR POPULATION. AND THE THE THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL ESSENTIALLY MY RECOGNIZES THAT WE ARE UNDERSTAFFED IN A FEW AREAS. IN PARTICULAR -- BUT WE DID NOT A WHEN WE INITIALLY - BUT FOR THE MODEL FIVE YEARS AGO -- HAVE IN THE JUST ONE FORM OF FEMALE PATIENTS. AND IT'S WELL RECOGNIZED THE THERE IS A GREATER A STAFFING NEED A TO DEAL WITH A FEMALE POPULATION ON THE MAIL -- SO WE NEEDED TO INCREASE ON ALLOCATION FOR OF THE FEMALE ON INSTITUTIONS. WE ALSO DO NOT -- TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH PATIENTS WHO ARE DISABLED. AND WE DID NOT APPROPRIATELY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE AGING OF THE PRISON POPULATION ON INMATES OVER -- FIFTY IN AND BASED UPON NEW INFORMATION THAT WE LOOKED AT IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE DECIDED WE NEEDED TO HAVE AN INCREASE. IN THOSE OUT LOCATIONS. THAT WAS THE FIRST IN A PRIMARY CARE SERVICES SECOND WE REALIZE THAT -- WE HAVE WITH OUR AGING POPULATION IN PARTICULAR A LOT OF SERIOUSLY ILL PATIENTS WHO HAVE VERY COMPLEX MEDICAL NEEDS -- AND WE NOW HAVE REALIZE WE NEED TO HAVE -- AN INCREASE IN ALLOCATIONS FOR THOSE PATIENTS. AND THEN -- FINALLY -- ANCILLARY STAFF WHO SUPPORT OUR PROVIDERS -- THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD AND WORKLOAD ADJUSTMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ARE DRIVING THE NEED FOR A CHANGE IN -- OUR ANCILLARY STAFF -- SO THE THAT'S THE BASIS OF FOR THE THE REQUEST. FOR AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE MEDICAL CLASSIFICATION MODEL. I KNOW THE LA -- SO ORIGINALLY. OR NOT ORIGNALLY THAT'S AN INACCURATE WHEN WE WERE FIRST -- DEVELOPING THE AGENDA. FOR THIS HEARING WE WERE GONNA HAVE A DISCUSSION ON THIS HOWEVER WE ARE NOW HAVING A DISCUSSION CLEARLY BUT WE HAD -- STAFF NINE GOING THROUGH. THE ITEMS -- BECAUSE THIS IS AN ITEM FROM THE RECEIVER. AND IN SOME RESPECTS DUE TO THE COURT ORDERED THE RECEIVER HAS THE ABILITY TO TO ACT ON SUCH THINGS -- INDEPENDENT OF OF THE LEGISLATURE'S APPROVAL AND THE PAST INFORMATION BASED ON THE STEPPING ALLOCATION SYSTEMS THAT WERE PUT INTO PLACE. HAVE NOW. SHOWN AS SAID THE RECEIVER'S INDICATED AS A NOW -- GIVEN US A BETTER BETTER INFORMATION ABOUT THE POPULATION WE'RE SERVING. AND THEIR NEEDS AND IDENTIFIED WHICH I THINK MOST OF US PROBABLY COULD'VE WITHOUT EVEN. NECESSARILY HAVING THE DATA TO KNOW THAT OUR POPULATION IS GETTING OLDER. AND THAT -- IT JUST AS THE GENERAL POPULATION. THE HEALTH NEEDS ARE MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS INCREASE. AND SO I DO TO THAT -- WE ELECTED TO PUT IT ON OTER ONLY. BUT THE LA -- HAD -- SOME OPINIONS SO I'M GONNA LET LA -- EXPRESS THOSE AND CLEARLY SINCE WE PULL THAT WE CAN HAVE A DISCUSSION NOW. GO AHEAD. THANK YOU LOU KOOSH MORROW THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE MEDICATION CLASSIFICATION MAHLER CURRENTLY IN PLACE DOES TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE CUTIE AND POPULATION OF THE INMATE POPULATION. OUR CONCERNS ARE. WHETHER THAT DATA IT IS SUFFICIENT TO ADJUST THAT MODEL CURRENTLY -- WE NOTE THAT THE COURT YOUR EXPENDITURES FOR MEDICAL CARE HAVE EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT THAT THE MEDICATION PROSECUTION MODEL WOULD HAVE PROVIDED. HOWEVER EMPIRE YOURS THE AMOUNT RIGHT IT HAS TO BE SUFFICIENT. WE ALSO NOTE THAT THAT UPDATED DATA PRESENT IN THE PROPOSAL IS GENERALLY OVER A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. ON TO THAT SHOP AT THE TIME THAT THAT ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM HAS BEEN IN PLACE. WE RECOMMEND APPROVING THE FUNDING ON A ONE TIME BASIS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE CURRENT YOUR AND ABOUT YOUR AND ALLOW TIME. TO COLLECT MORE DATA AND ANALYZE WHETHER THE ADJUSTMENTS BEING MADE OF WOOD SO -- SUFFICIENTLY MEET THE MEDICAL NEEDS OF THE POPULATION AND DO SO ON A SUSTAINABLE WAY ALL OF THE OTHER. DIFFERENT ADJUSTMENT WOULD BE NEEDED [inaudible] THANK YOU. SO THE RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO DO A ONE TIME ONLY VERSUS ON GOING. YES THAT'S CORRECT AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THOSE POSITIONS COULD BE HARD TO FILL HOWEVER WE NOTE THAT. IN THE PAST THE RECEIVER HAS MADE UP FOR VACANCIES THROUGH USING REGISTRY SERVICES TO PROVIDE SERVICES -- YEAH ON MY WHEN YOU WERE. SO VERY COMMONLY WE HAVE. ITEMS BEFORE US THAT ARE APPROVING ONE TIME OR PROVING TEMPORARY. AND NOT IN ALL CASES BUT VERY OFTEN THOSE ARE FINE -- FOR POSITIONS THAT ARE FAR LESS TECHNICAL THAN HERE HERE WERE ACTUALLY -- IT SEEMS DIFFICULT. WELL I APPRECIATE THE LA SHOWS -- WHAT THEY'VE RAISED ABOUT IN THE PAST WE WEREN'T EXCEEDING THE FUNDING ALLOCATION BUT WE DID THIS YEAR? THAT RATHER THAN JUST ASSUMING WE ALWAYS WELL. ON THE OTHER HAND. THESE ARE NOT POSITIONS THAT ARE EASY TO FILL IN JEST ESPECIALLY FOR SAYING OKAY SIR -- FOR TWELVE MONTHS ONLY. AND IT COULD BE THAT. THEY DON'T EVEN GET FILLED RIGHT AWAY AND SO THEN HOW DO WE EVEN MAKE THE ADJUSTMENT SO. BUT I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THE RECEIVER COMMENT AND THEN SEE IF MY COLLEAGUES SEVENTY COMMENTS. THANK YOU MA'AM SURE I AGREE WITH YOU THESE ME VERY DIFFICULT FILL ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS -- SOME OF THESE WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ALL. ARM WHICH YOU PUT ME IN A POSITION OF HAVING TO THE SIDE WORLD WHAT DO I DO AND THE WHITE. EXPAND THE USE OF REGISTRY ONE HOW DO I RESPOND TO THAT SO I I THINK A ONE YEAR FUNDING OF SIMPLY FOR THESE TYPE OF POSITIONS DOESN'T WORK -- I WOULD NOTED -- IN ADDITION -- IN THE IF THIS GIVES APPROVED OF THE WAY TO THE AND ACTUALLY GET BUDGET SAVINGS. IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO ARE INCARCERATED. REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DYING IN PRISON -- AFTER HAVING GONE THROUGH EXPENSIVE MEDICAL TREATMENT. OF FIGURE OUT HOW -- TO STOP HAVING THEM OF THESE MOST VULNERABLE AND EXPENSE OF PEOPLE IN PRISON -- I THINK THAT ACTUALLY ON IT IS A BETTER SOLUTION. THEM -- HAVING US TRY TO DO THIS ON A ONE TIME BASIS. ON THAT NOTE. LET US LET US -- OKAY LET'S DO SOME CONJECTURE. LET'S SAY WE WERE. TO RE VISIT OUR MEDICAL PAROLE ON OUR ELDERLY PAROLE -- POLICIES WHICH WERE DESIGNED. TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAD -- PEOPLE IN PRISON THAT WERE VERY ADVANCED STAGES AND THAT ALSO IN MANY CASES WERE -- COMPUTER THERE MANY OF MEDICAL CONDITION INCAPACITATED SO FROM A POINT OF VIEW OF CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY IN LITTLE TO NO POSITION TO BE A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY. HOWEVER WERE OF A HIGH HIGH COST TO THE STATE BY KEEPING THEM IN THE WAY THAT. THAT THEY ARE CURRENTLY HOUSE SO LET'S ON THAT CONJECTURE -- IN ASSUME THAT WE'VE MADE THOSE POLICIES MORE ROBUST. AND LET'S SAY THOSE WITHIN THREE YEARS WE ARE TO MAKE THOSE POLICIES MORE ROBUST AND THEY WERE STARTING TO BE IMPLEMENTED. WOULD DOUBT ARGUES TO APPROVE ALL OF THESE POSITIONS ARE PERMANENTLY AS YOU'VE SUGGESTED SO WHAT I'M ASKING IS GIVEN. THAT SO. SO I'M DOING VARIATION NOW SO LA -- SAID DO IT ONE TIME ONLY I THINK WE'VE REYES THAT ONE TIME ONLY IS DIFFICULT FOR THE NATURE OF THESE TYPE OF POSITIONS. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT IN THE PAST WE DIDN'T NEED AS MANY EXCEPT FOR THIS YEAR SO. IS THERE A HYBRID HERE ARE THERE A FEW LESS POSITIONS. POTENTIALLY THAT WE NEED FOR LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT. IT WAS ONLY THIS ONE YEAR. THAT WE EXCEEDED OUR THE EXPENSES EXCEEDED OUR ALLOCATION -- MANAGER THE IF IT TURNS OUT THAT -- THERE ARE REDUCTIONS. OF REDUCTIONS IN STAFF WILL HAPPEN AUTOMATICALLY -- AS PART OF THE ON A REGULAR POPULATION ADJUSTMENT PROCESS. SO -- YOU'RE PROVING PERMANENT POSITIONS BOUGHT THEIR SUBJECTS. TO OUR POPULATION REDUCTIONS SO IT IT NATURALLY WILL HAPPEN THAT THERE WOULD BE A REDUCTION IN STAFF IF IT TURNS OUT THAT. WE ARE ABLE TO REDUCE SOME OF OF THE THESE. WORKLOAD DRIVING POPULATIONS. AND IN TERMS OF WHETHER I THINK THOSE WHO YOU KNOW. IS IT HALF OF THESE THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED NO I THINK WE ACTUALLY NEED -- EVERYTHING THAT WERE ASKING FOR HERE HELLO. ONE OPTION IF WE WANT TO GO FORWARD WITH APPROVING THIS IS CHANGE THE METHODOLOGY WOULD BE TO REQUIRE REPORTING ON ACTUAL USAGE RELATIVE TO WHAT THE MODEL IS PROVIDING. THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO IDENTIFY IF THERE IS A MISMATCH IN THE FUTURE AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS NECESSARY. THAT'S A GOOD SUGGESTION. SENATOR BOB. DOLE. THIS IS BASED ON THE POPULATION RISE OF THESE KIND OF PATIENTS CORRECT. THE ADDED STAFF THAT YOU'RE A WELL THE END OF STAFF IS ACTUALLY BECAUSE WE PREVIOUSLY DID NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE HEAVIER WORKLOAD. FOR WOMEN YEAH -- BUT YES IT'S BASICALLY ONCE IT'S BUILT INTO THE MODEL YEAR OF OPERATION THE POPULATION IS GOING UP -- SO WHEN THE POPULATION GOES DOWN WHAT HAPPENS YOU LIMITED THESE POSITIONS. OF WHAT'S WHAT'S THE SITUATION -- HOW HOW WOULD THAT BE AN? LOCAL USUALLY -- THE MEDICAL SYSTEM WILL HAVE LIKE FLUCTUATIONS IN. SPECIALLY LIKE AN INPATIENT I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE HAVING LIKE A MORE. IMPATIENT -- ARE YOU LOOKING AT Y. EIGHT MORE DAYS PER PATIENT IN THE IN PATIENT. YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON THERE -- AND SEEMS LIKE YOURS NO CONTROL OR AB KENTUCKY. THAT'S AN AREA I WOULD I WOULD WONDER ABOUT. WHEN I SAW THAT I SO WELL HE'S GOT MORE? LONGER STAYS IN THE IN PATIENT WHAT'S GOING ON THERE THE COSTS MONEY. SO WHY WHY IS THAT HAPPENING. WELL IN TERMS OF PROCESS. YEAH I'M INTO AND GET SENT TO THE NEXT ITEM BUT I'M I'M ASKING THEM NOW SO YOU. YEAH IN MY EYES I'M SUSPICIOUS WHY THAT IN PATIENTS GOING UP. IN TERMS OF THE POSITION REDUCTIONS -- WE WOULD DO THAT THROUGH ATTRITION OR FIND ANOTHER VACANCIES -- THE LAYOFF PROCESSES ARE OUR LAST OPTION WHEN IT COMES TO POSITION REDUCTIONS AND NORMALLY WITH OUR POPULATION REDUCTIONS ITS USE ON THE MARGIN WE CAN ABSORB THOSE. OR THESE TEMPORARY INCREASES OR THE YOU LOOK LIKE A MORE -- LEVELING OFFER WHICH STORY -- WELL I I SUSPECT IS A LEVELING OFF THE IF IF THIS CHANGE TO THE MODELS APPROVED WE FILL THESE-POSITIONS AND THE POPULATION I DON'T. KNOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE POPULATION PROJECTIONS ARE I DON'T THINK THERE [inaudible] INCREASING SUBSTANTIALLY NARROWER BUT IT WOULD DOWN THE THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING IF THINGS ARE GOING DOWN. THEY ARE LIKELY WONDERING THEN IT WOULD DEPEND ON ARE YOU BRINGING DOWN I KNOW WHICH POPULOUS CORRECT. YEAH YOU'RE BRINGING DOWN THE HEALTHY YOUNG GUYS -- THAT HELPS A LITTLE BIT BUT IT DOESN'T HELP ALL THAT MUCH SO IT DEPENDS ON THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE POPULATION REDUCTION CAN FOCUS ON THE IN PATIENT PART OF IT YEAH LIKE -- LET ME HAVE WIRE WHERE -- YOU HAVING MORE LONGER STAYS IN THE IN PATIENT OR MAY HAVE DOC KANE AND DO YOU CONTROL THAT I MEAN HOW DO YOU CAN. YOU KNOW LIKE THAT'S ONE OF THE PRIMARY THINGS HOSPITAL WHO'S THE THE HAVE PROTOCOLS TO CONTROL YOUR INPATIENT. SO WHAT'S GOING ON AND I THINK. OVER A CANE AND I THINK PART OF WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO A SENATOR BAIL IS ACTUALLY A PATIENTS WHO ARE. ADMITTED TO OUR OUTSIDE COMMUNITY HOSPITALS THERE WE ARE SEEN ON ALTHOUGH THE ADMISSIONS ARE ACTUALLY NOT GOING UP AT THE SAME RATE WE ARE SEEN LONGER LENGTH OF STAY. AND ACTUALLY THAT'S RELATEDTO THAT TWO THINGS BUT REALLY IT REALLY BOILS DOWN -- TO THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PATIENT A CASE MIX -- ONE OF THE POPULATIONS THAT STRIVING THAT IS ACTUALLY OUR PATIENTS ARE GETTING OLDER AND SICKER SO IF YOU LOOK AT OUR STANCE FOR HIGH RISK ONE INTO PATIENTS. THAT IS GOING ON UP AND THAT IS COMMENSURATE WITH AN INCREASE IN THE ADMISSIONS TO OUR COMMUNITY HOSPITAL. THERE'S ALSO KIND OF A SECOND GROUP OF OF PATIENTS WHO ARE REALLY NOT -- WHO WEREN'T AS COMPLEX -- PRIOR TO HOSPITALIZATION BUT THIS IS ACTUALLY RELATED TO THE INCREASE IN TRAUMA THAT WERE SEEN IN INCREASES IN -- OVERDOSES AND INFECTIONS WERE ACTUALLY RELATED TO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ON SO THOSE TWO DIFFERENT PATIENT POPULATIONS ARE DRIVING THE INCREASE IN ADMISSIONS BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY DISPROPORTIONATELY. THEY'RE DRIVING THE INCREASED LENGTH OF STAY IN THE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL AND I WILL SAY THAT ARE WE WE TRACK VERY CLOSELY -- WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR PATIENTS TO BE DISCHARGED AND PATIENTS ARE DISCHARGED -- BY AND LARGE WHEN THEY NEED TO BE FROM THE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL WE CALL IT ADMINISTRATIVE BAD DAYS AND WE HAVE VERY LOW NUMBERS OF THAT. OKAY AND SO CENTER WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE -- A YUBA UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT TYPE SYSTEMS THAT RIGHT AS YOU CAN TELL KEEP TRACK PRETTY CLOSELY OF OF THESE SORT OF ISSUES. THE DO YOU HAVE -- NO HEALTH OUTCOMES MEASUREMENTS. SO YES YOU'RE SAYING THE PATIENTS ARE GET ANY BETTER SO WHAT'S YOUR STRATEGY ON HEALTH OUTCOMES THAT. TO MAKE YOU KNOW IS THERE IS THERE A STRATEGY ON NOT. WELL FOR YOUR HEALTH OKAY WE CERTAINLY WANT IF YOU LOOK AT ON IN TERMS OF DEATHS. EVERYWHERE EXCEPT ON OVERDOSE -- WHAT WE HAVE REDUCE DEATHS OF THE DEATH RATES ASSOCIATE OR DOES IT SHOULD ON A LITTLE BIT OVERDOSES OF GONE UP SUBSTANTIALLY -- ON OTHER SORTS OF CONDITIONS THAT WE WOULD TYPICALLY. OF A WAR WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PATIENTS. OF DIABETES FOR EXAMPLE ON IN STAGE LIVER DISEASE THERE -- WOULD WE TRACK OUR PERFORMANCE -- VERY CLOSELY AGAINST OF THE PERFORMANCE OF OUTSIDE -- THE MEDICAL HOSPITALS AND MEDICAL SYSTEMS ARE IN OUR PERFORMANCE CONTINUES TO BE BETTER THAN MOST HMO SO -- WAS SIMILAR TO THE VET ADMINISTRATION -- AT TIMES APPROACHING -- KAISER LEVEL OF QUALITY SO WE'RE TRACKING OBJECTIVE. OUTCOME MEASURES ARE ON A ROUTINE BASIS AND ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE SUCCESSFULLY I THINK THAT WERE EXCEEDING. THE PERFORMANCE IN THE COMMUNITY. IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF STAFF ON THE TABLES A BNC HAVE. OF THE THE QUESTION I WOULD HAVE ON THAT IS THE I SEE THE THE THE MAJOR INCREASES IN PHARMACY. AND THEN YOU HAVE -- FOOD. FOOD SERVICES. OKAY CAN YOU EXPLAIN KNOWS WHY. FOOD SERVICES WHAT'S GOING ON THERE. IN FOOD SERVICES I DON'T SEE WHAT WE DID WE LABEL BE ACTUALLY YEAH -- FOR THE FOR THE DIETARY PIECE -- AND COOKS COOKS YEAH THE COOKS WOULDN'T HAVE A MODEL FOR AND SO WE'RE UPDATING OUR MODEL BE CONSISTENT WITH CITIES HERE ARE. THE EVERY LEAVE. AND THAT RELIEF PROVIDES -- FOR THEM TO HAVE THE APPROPRIATE STAFFING DALY AND WE'D WE HAD NEVER BASS LINE OUR COOKS IN OUR INPATIENT UNITS -- AND SO WE'RE RE BASING OUR COOKS TO THE TO THE CDC OUR BLUEPRINT MODEL SO WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE RELIEF AND STAFFING TO PROVIDE SERVICES SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. OKAY DO YOU -- THE NURSES. THERE'S QUITE A FEW NURSES PROPOSALS AND NURSE INSTRUCTORS. CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT. THERE'S BEEN IT. SHOULD INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF TRAINING THE THAT IS PROVIDED TO OUR OUR NURSING STAFF AND WE HAVE. UPWARDS OF FIVE THOUSAND NURSING STAFF -- SO WE SAW A CRITICAL GAP WE WE HAVE BASICALLY ONE NURSE INSTRUCTOR PER FACILITY. AND THAT HAS PROVEN TO BE INSUFFICIENT -- SO WE'RE CLOSING THAT GAP ON THE INFECTION CONTROL -- INFECTION CONTROL -- WAS NEVER PART OF THE ORIGINAL MODEL AND WE CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE THAT FUNCTION IN OUR FACILITIES AND THAT'S A BIG GAP IN HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT AND SO. WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO CORRECT THAT GAP NOW. SO YOU'RE GOING FROM -- ONE SO THE THIRTY THIRTY TWO WE'RE GOING TO THIRTY FOUR THIRTY FOUR NURSES. SO EACH EACH. IS FOR SOIL HAVE INFECTION CONTROL. NEVER SPECIFICALLY FOR INFECTION CONTROL IN EACH FACILITY CORRECT AS OPPOSED TO WE DON'T HAVE THAT ANYMORE YEAH WE JUST DON'T HAVE IT. OKAY SO THAT NURSE WILL BE IN CHARGE OF THE WHOLE SUBJECT YES OR THE PLANNING FOR THEM -- OKAY -- I WAS JUST LOOKING AT OUR POPULATION NUMBERS -- IN TERMS OF WHO IS HOUSED CURRENTLY WE HAVE. THERE YOU KNOW. THE HIGHER HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN K. A OUR THOUSAND IN INMATES RIGHT NOW. AND OF THOSE. ABOUT THIRTY NINE THOUSAND ARE LONG LONG TERM SO WE'VE GOT TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND LIFERS. FIVE THOUSAND WALKED. AND SEVEN THOUSAND THIRD STRIKERS SO THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE THAT ARE -- IT BASICALLY GONNA GET OLD IN OUR PRISONS AND WHICH I THINK IS THE POINT THAT'S BEING MADE HERE AND UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. IN TERMS OF IF WE LEAVE ITAS IT IS EVEN WITH. SOME OF THE CHANGES WITH CREDIT AND SUCH -- THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF THESE FOLKS WHO JUST START. ELIGIBLE DATE SO. WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE OUR THE COSTS AROUND THE MEDICAL IN SUCH INCREASE JUST DUE TO THE FACT OF THE POPULATION THAT WE'RE THE WAY OUR SENTENCING CONDITIONS AND SUCH SO -- THIS IS ANOTHER ONE LIKE HER MENTAL HEALTH THAT WE MAY WANNA. DO SOME HEARINGS IN THE INTERIM OR A HEARING. BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED -- POLICIES LIKE COMPASSIONATE RELEASE POLICIES ON MEDICAL PAROLE POLICIES ON ELDERLY. AND THE DATA THAT WE'VE RECEIVED TO DATE WOULD INDICATE THAT IT'S THESE POLICIES THAT WE HAVE -- APPROVED HAVE NOT. THE BEEN RARELY LITTLE UTILIZED. SO WE MAY WANT TO LOOK FURTHER AT THAT -- BECAUSE FOR A PUBLIC SAFETY POINT OF VIEW. OUR HOUSING SOME NUMBER OF THESE PEOPLE IS NOT NECESSARILY BRINGING US PUBLIC SAFETY BUT DEFINITELY BRINGING US VERY HIGH COSTS -- ANYWAY SO THE GROUP. WE MAYBE WE COULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION. TO APPROVE AS BUDGETED BUT WITH THE ADDITION OF A REPORT -- AS THE LA -- SUGGESTED SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AT UTILIZATION RATES AND MAKE A FUTURE ADJUSTMENT IF NEEDED. I MAKE A MOTION PICTURE. ALL RIGHT. A DEPARTMENT FINANCE JACQUELINE COME THE PART OF FINANCE I THINK -- PROVIDING SOME REPORTING METRICS THAT AREN'T OVERLY ADMINISTRATIVELY BURDENSOME MAKES SENSE -- THE THE TERM REPORT SEEMED A LITTLE BIT MORE ROBUST AND I THINK I WAS MAKING BUT DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THAT ACT ON THE METRICS THAT WERE USED TO JUSTIFY THE REQUEST. SEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE ASK OKAY -- YES THAT IS WHAT I WAS INTENDING VERSUS -- A LONG -- SUBJECTIVE REPORT IT WAS MUCH MORE IN THE MATRIX OKAY SO WITH THE CLARIFICATION ON THE MOTION I'LL TAKE A ROLL CALL. CENTER SKINNER HI THERE MARK CENTRE BELL. I'M WILL HOLD IT OPEN IN CASE SENATOR MORE LIKE ONE STAT ON ALL RIGHT NOW SINCE WE HAVE THE RECEIVER AT THE TABLE. AND I'M THINKING THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO WITH OUR NEXT ITEM WAS -- UNDER -- UNDER. THE ITEM FIVE TWO TWO FIVE ISSUE EIGHT THEIR CONTRACT MEDICAL AUGMENTATION. BUT THE OTHER RECEIVER ITEM THAT WE HAVE. ON OUR AGENDA. IS -- WHICH ONE WHICH NUMBER. TWENTY EIGHT TO TWENTY EIGHT SO PERHAPS WE WOULD DO NOW ISSUE EIGHT AND FOLLOW IT BY ISSUE. TWENTY EIGHT THAT [inaudible] THAT WORK. SO WE DEAL WITH THE WITH THE BACK TO THE NUMBER EATEN. YET WE'RE GONNA GO TO EIGHT RIGHT NOW. OKAY ISSUE EIGHT THANK YOU MA'AM CHAIR -- THE THE BUDGET INCLUDES AN AUGMENTATION OF SIXTY ONE POINT NINE MILLION OFFER CONTRACT MEDICAL SERVICES THERE ARE I THINK A REALLY TWO ASPECTS OF THIS THE FIRST IS. A STARK CANAAN'S ALREADY MENTIONED WE SIMPLY SEEN I INCREASES IN LENGTH OF STAY INCREASES IN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE STATE BECAUSE OF GREATER COMPLEXITY -- AND POSSIBLY INCREASES IN THE COSTS OF OUTSIDE HOSPITAL HERE. A SHE CAN ADDRESS THOSE IN GREATER DETAIL THERE IS A SECOND ASPECT TO THIS THIS JUST A BUDGET MANAGEMENT. ON THE ISSUE OF THAT ARE USEFUL I HAVE TO TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY -- FOR WE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN. ON THIS LINE OF OUR BUDGET. SEEING INCREASES BEYOND THAT THE AUTHORIZATION FOR ABOUT FOUR YEARS. AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE ON DURING THOSE YEARS AS WE HAVE COVER THOSE COSTS. ARE BASED ON A CENTRALLY SALARY SAVINGS BECAUSE WE WENT THROUGH A COUPLE OF YEARS WHERE WE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DOWN. IN THE OUR STAFFING WHERE WE HAD AS MUCH AS 2225% VACANCIES IN CLINICAL STAFFING. WHICH GENERATED AN ENORMOUS SAVINGS. ON END OF SENSUALLY I MADE THE MISTAKE I CONSIDERED IN RETROSPECT A MISTAKE. OF USING THOSE SAVINGS TO OFFSET THE INCREASES IN CONTRACT MEDICAL AND THEN I THINK THE MISTAKE WAS NOT TELLING FINANCE ON A YEAR BY YEAR BASIS. THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED TO INCREASE THE AUTHORIZATION FOR CONTRACT MEDICAL. THE RESULT IS WE'RE HAVING TO PLAY CATCH UP. BECAUSE IN THE LAST YEAR. WE ACTUALLY HAVE FILLED ON NEARLY ALL OF THOSE CLINICAL POSITIONS. SO WE DID NOT GENERATE A COST SAVINGS THAT WE COULD USE TO COVER THIS -- THAT WAS THE REASON THAT WE HAD -- A REQUEST FOR A DEFICIENCY -- AND THIS RELATES TO THE ACT OF SENSUALLY WE NEED A ONE TIME CATCH UP. ON AND I HAVE DONE MY APPROPRIATE PENANCE OF OVER THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IN ASSURE THEM THAT THE I WON'T BE DOING THIS IN THE FUTURE -- AND THAT WE WILL -- BE SHARING. OUR EARLIER IN THE YEAR. ON ANY AND ALL INFORMATION ABOUT PROJECTED INCREASES FOR EXAMPLE IN CONTRACT MEDICAL OR PHARMACEUTICALS. SO THE BUT BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT CAUGHT OFF GUARD CENTERVILLE. SO THE COST DRIVERS -- THE INPATIENT HOSPITAL -- WHAT KIND OF -- HOSPITAL TREATMENT ARE YOU PUTTING PEOPLE AND IS THIS OF INTENSIVE CARE OR REGULAR HOSPITAL LIKE YOU HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS. CAN YOU GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE OF WHAT WHAT KIND OF CARE LEVELS ARE. YOU PUTTING PEOPLE AT THE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY RESERVE THE WE BREAK IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT MAYBE. WELL I'M I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE THEM THE DATA FOR YOU IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE SORT OF THE BREAKDOWN OF THE DIFFERENT KIND OF LEVELS OF CARE ONCE WE SEND THE PATIENT ALLAH BUT IT. IT REALLY IS THE WHOLE CONTINUUM THAT YOU THAT YOU MENTIONED -- A LOT OF THIS IS DRIVEN -- THROUGH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT THE PATIENT IS THEN ADMITTED ON MOST OF THEM GO TO YOU KNOW GENERAL MEDICAL -- WARDS OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SPECIALIZED A UNITS AS WELL FOR CARDIOLOGY IS AN EXAMPLE -- AND WE DO A SEND PATIENTS TO THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT AS WELL -- ACROSS ALL THOSE SPECTRUMS ONCE THEY'RE HOSPITALIZED WHAT WE ARE SEEN OUR PATIENTS WHO ARE STAYING LONGER. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE CODING REGARDLESS OF THE DIAGNOSES THAT THESE PATIENTS HAVE. IT'S OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH MORE COMPLEXITY. SO WE'RE SEEING THE SAME TYPE OF DIAGNOSES -- THAT WE WERE SEEN IN PREVIOUS YEARS EXCEPT THAT THEY ARE NOW -- THERE NOW CONSIDERED MUCH MORE COMPLICATED. ARE YOU -- WHEN YOU SAY HOSPITAL INPATIENT WHEN I THINK OF A HOSPITAL INPATIENT I THINK OF? A HOSPITAL NOT. A NURSING HOME OR YOU'RE NOT. SENDING PEOPLE TO THOSE KIND OF FACILITIES CANNELLA THEY'RE NOT REALLY LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES -- SO REALLY TALKING ABOUT A CUTE YOU DON'T A CUTE GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS SO YOU GO IN THERE IN THESE [inaudible] SPEND [inaudible] TIME THERE -- DO YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO SPEND MORE THAN -- A WEEK. YES THESE FACILITIES YEAH SO WHAT KIND OF THEME IN CLOSE ONES ACOSTA OUR MONEY RIGHT. WELL THE THE COST OF THE COST OF HOSPITALIZATION IS DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS BUT ONE OF THE MAJOR DRIVERS THAT WE ARE SEEING. IS THAT THEY ARE STAYING LONGER ON AVERAGE A LONGER. SO WHAT KIND OF CONTROLS ARE YOU AS ESTABLISHING [inaudible] ON THAT. AGAIN IT WAS EITHER SAID WE HAVE A VERY ROBUST UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM RIGHT STAFF WITH PHYSICIANS AND NURSES. AND WE COMMUNICATE WELL ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY HOSPITALS THERE ARE SEVERAL DOZEN OF THAT WE WORK WITH ON A DAILY BASIS -- TO MONITOR WHO WAS RECENTLY ADMITTED WHO'S READY FOR DISCHARGE AND TO BEGIN THAT DISCHARGE PLANNING. AND AS I MENTIONED. WE HAVE VERY LOW NUMBERS OF PATIENTS WHO WE KNOW ARE READY FOR DISCHARGE WHO IN FACT. A STAY IN THE HOSPITAL LONGER THAN THEY SHOULD. WE HAVE VERY LOW ADMINISTRATIVE BAD DAY SO AGAIN ON MOST OF THESE PATIENTS HAVE A BONA FIDE DIAGNOSES -- THAT SHOULD BE ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL BUT AGAIN WHAT WE ARE SEEN BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR PATIENT -- OUR PATIENT POPULATION IS GOING UP THE HIGH RISK PATIENTS BUT WE ARE ALSO SEEN. OUR PATIENTS WHO ARE GETTING ADMITTED WHO WERE -- NOT NECESSARILY HIGH RISK CRIER TO ADMISSIONS -- BUT ARE BEING ADMITTED NOW -- BECAUSE OF SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA -- BECAUSE OF DRUG RELATED PROBLEMS A SIGNIFICANT INFECTIONS FOR EXAMPLE OR RELATED TO OVERDOSE OF SO YOU. DO HAVE A VARIATION IN THE RATES THE HOSPITAL'S [inaudible] CHARGE THE DEPARTMENT OF FOR THE SAME. SERVICES IS THERE ARE A WIDE VARIATION OF RATES. THAT THE HOSPITAL'S CHARGE AND WHAT'S YOUR CONTROL MECHANISM ON CONTROLLING THE HOSPITAL CHARGES ON THE RATES. WITH THE HOSPITALS. WE CONTRACT WITH HEALTH NET. AND HEALTH THAT -- BY THE SUPERVISOR NETWORK TO WORK WITHIN IN THE THEY DO MANY OF THOSE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS WE DO HAVE A FEW HOSPITALS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE HELP THAT CONTRACT THAT -- WE DO WORK WITH AND AND YOU TO GO SHE ASIANS THOSE ARE HEALTH NET AFFILIATED HOSPITALS. THE MAJORITY YES OKAY -- THEY INCLUDE PUBLIC HOSPITALS OUR I BELIEVE SO [inaudible] YEAH OKAY. AND SO ON SO I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT. WHAT KIND OF VARIATION OF RATES TO THE? YOU KNOW LIKE. AND IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG I THINK THAT STATUTE ACTUALLY SPECIFIES HOW MUCH OF THE DEPARTMENT IS ALLOWED TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES AND I THINK IT MAY BE LIKE PERCENT OF MEDICARE MEDICARE. MEDICARE I THINK SO. IN 25% OF MEDICARE SO IF YOU. RELEASED THE PATIENTS AND TO TREATMENT DUDE AUTOMATICALLY GET A 25% LESS COST. RIGHT YES. OKAY. ASSEMBLY SO THERE MIGHT BE SOME TO LOOK INTO. SO SO IF THEY'RE IF THEY'RE RELEASED FOR MEDICAL DISCHARGE OR OR COMPASSIONATE RELEASE ROSE. THOSE KIND OF RELEASE THAT WOULD REDUCE THE COST. JUST ON OF MEDICAID AND MEDICARE MEDICARE RATE. NOT MEDI CAL RATE OKAY. MEDICARE RATES HIGHER YEAH MEDI CAL RATES LOWER. SO SO IF THE PERSON. WAS RELEASED IN A META CAL RATED THE BIG SAVINGS [inaudible] SO. DO IF IF -- THAT COULD BE INTERJECTS. FOR SO IS THERE SOMETHING IS A YOU CAN GIVE US ON ON ELIGIBLE. POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE. PATIENTS FOR MEDICAL DISCHARGE. DOES THAT MONEY [inaudible] SUBCOMMITTEE. SOME TO LOOK INTO. SO I'D LIKE TO HAVE THAT LOOKED INTO. SO WE ARE THERE YOU'LL SAVE MONEY COLLECTOR [inaudible] YES [inaudible] WE WOULD -- AS INDICATED BEFORE THESE MAY BE SUBJECTS OF SOME VERY -- INFORMATIVE INFORMATIONAL HEARING -- IN OUR WHEN WE'RE NOT UNDER THE PRESS OF A BUDGET OPTION. SO YOU -- CENTER BILL DID YOU HAVE A MOTION ON THIS OF A FEW -- MAKE THE MOTION. AND THE SUGGESTION THAT WE EXPLORE THOSE THOSE ISSUES RAISED. ALL RIGHT SO -- THE MOTION THEN IS A APPROVE IS BUDGETED. BUT WITH -- HOME HOUSE LIKE CHARACTERIZE THIS. SOME OF THE ISSUES RAISED. BY THE REPORT BACK ON THE MANY CHARACTERIZE IT IS HOW WE MIGHT -- REDUCE THESE COSTS WHAT OPTIONS -- WE MIGHT HAVE. TO YEAH AND AND THIS IS A JUST ABOUT YOUR REQUEST WE DO PLAN ON COLLECTING SOME ADDITIONAL DATA COMING BACK -- WITH THE FUTURE PROPOSAL TO ADDRESSES ISSUES OF THIS IS THIS IS JUST A ONE YEAR AUGMENTATION AND BUDGET YEAR. SO I MADE THE MOTION BECAUSE WHEN YOU TESTIFIED YOU OPEN THE DOOR ON THE SUBJECT SO. THE WALKTHROUGH. I'D SAY THAT WAY SO WITH THAT IN THE SUBJECT ON EARLY RELEASE ANOTHER THING SO I WALK THROUGH THE DOOR IS. OPEN. YET AND SUGGESTS THAT WE GET THE INFORMATION IF WE'RE GONNA EXPLORE ANY KIND OF BUDGETARY SAVINGS WE SHOULD EXPLORE EVERY OPTIONS FOR BUDGETARY SAVINGS. RIGHT SO WE'LL DO THIS -- AS BUDGET WHICH IS THE ONE TIME ALLOCATION BUT WILL ALSO IN -- FOR OUR IN THE ITEM NEXT YEAR WE WILL GET SOME -- OPTIONS FOR HOW WE MIGHT AND REDUCE THESE COSTS. ART. WE HAVE A MOTION LET'S TO ROLL CALL. CENTER SKINNER BY SENATOR MORLOCK [inaudible] CENTRE BELL. OKAY SO WE WERE GONNA GO NEXT -- TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE YES THOUGH I SHOULD ASK FOR PUBLIC COMMENT POLICIES ISSUED ON IT BEFORE YOU -- ACTED BUT THERE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ITEM WE JUST DID. ALRIGHT SO THIS NOW IS GOING TO BE THE THE SEVEN SEAS DISORDER PROGRAM BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE WITH YOUR INDULGENCE TO HAVE A FIVE MINUTE RECESS. SO THAT -- OUR SPECIAL SERVICES CAN PUT THE PODIUM HERE SO I MAY UTILIZE THAT TO STAND FROM THIS POINT ON AND AND IF ANYONE HAS ANY OTHER AT NEED WILL DO A FIVE MINUTE -- FOR DISCUSSION AFTER A BRIEF RECESS. AND WE HAVE GOT -- WE ARE. JUST VERY BRIEFLY GOING TO REOPEN ISSUE SEVEN WHICH WE ALREADY VOTED ON TO SEE -- SENATOR MORE LOCK IF YOU WANT TO ADD ON WHICH YOU AND JUST READ THE MOTION ON ISSUE -- SEVEN YEAH SO THE THE MOTION IS. TO APPROVE THE PROPOSAL -- AS BUDGETED BUT INCLUDE ALEJO REPORTING LANGUAGE [inaudible] OKAY. ALRIGHT SO THAT VOTE WAS THREE NOTHING AND A WE WILL NOW GO. TO OUR DISCUSSION ON THE MEDICALLY ASSISTED. A DRUG TREATMENT PROGRAM GO AHEAD -- MR RECEIVER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- I'M DELIGHTED TO BE HERE TO PRESENT -- OF THE GOVERNOR'S -- INTEGRATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROGRAM -- I HAVE WITH ME FOR STOCKTON THEY CAME IN AND I'M JOINED NOW BY -- OR A RUNNING SUSAN CORRECT -- WHOSE POSITION MODEL I'LL GET THE JOB TITLE WRONGS FOLLOWED HIM INTRODUCES JOB TITLE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. THANK YOU THE THE COMMITTEE STAFF REPORTS -- THAT REALLY DOES A GREAT JOB OF SUMMARIZING -- THE SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM OUR INITIAL FOCUS -- AND WHAT WE HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH IN THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS -- I THINK I CAN FAIRLY DESCRIBE OUR APPROACH HERE -- AS OF GOLD GOLD GO BIG -- I BUT I THINK IT'S FAIRLY DESCRIBES IT -- THE VALIUM IS PROBABLY BEST OF AT LEAST I THINK IT MAY BE -- INSTEAD OF TRYING TO SUMMARIZE -- THIS COMPLEX PROGRAM IT MAY BE BEST FOR US TO JUST JUMP IN THE QUESTIONS I'M HAPPY TO SUMMARIZE IT BUT IT IN THE STAFF REPORT REALLY DOES -- AN EXCELLENT JOB OF DESCRIBING ITS COMPONENT PARTS. OKAY I'M LET US SEE IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS BY MY COLLEAGUES OR IF WE HOLD ON A MINUTE WE DID HAVE AN LA -- FOR A RECOMMENDATION ARE PERHAPS A SHELVE ELLIE -- PERCENT AND THEN WE CAN OPEN FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS GO AHEAD EARLIER. EARLY LOOK WHO'S MORE WITH THE LA -- WE DID IDENTIFY A FEW CONCERNS WITH THIS THE PROPOSAL WE NOTE THAT. ASPECTS OF IT ARE EVIDENCE BASED FOR INSTANCE MEDICATIONS THIS TREATMENT HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OPTION AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN. MANY CIRCUMSTANCES. OF ART THEM THIS IS A LARGE SCALE IMPLEMENTATION OF A PROGRAM THAT IS UNTESTED BECAUSE MANY. WHAT INCLUDES ASPECTS OUR EVIDENCE BASED NOT ALL ASPECTS ARE EVIDENCE BASED IN THIS COMBINATION OF PROGRAMS HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED TO BE EFFECTIVE -- WE NOTE THAT IN THE ONE ASPECT THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES TREATING PATIENTS WITH A FORM OF MEDICATION AND IT LONG LASTING JEKYLL FROM A GROUP AN ORPHAN THAT'S NEVER BEEN TESTED IN A CORRECTIONAL SETTING TO SEE IF IT HOW EFFECTIVE IT WOULD BE AT TREATING. INDIVIDUALS COMPARED TO THE OTHER FORMS OF MEDICATIONS AS THE ALL FORMS WHICH ARE SEVERAL TIMES CHEAPER. THE ONLY -- PILOT OF THIS DRUG IS CURRENTLY BEING CONDUCTED BY PENNSYLVANIA AND OUR PRISON SYSTEM. HOWEVER OR NOT BUT IT HAS RUN INTO SEVERAL ADMINISTRATIVE ISSUES AND SO. WHILE I WAS INITIALLY PLANNED TO LAUNCH IN JANUARY OF TWENTY NINETEEN THEY'RE STILL STRUGGLING TO GET THE FIRST PATIENTS ENROLLED. THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ROLL ABOUT DRUG OUT STATEWIDE TO TREAT 10% OF THE M. A. T. PARTICIPANTS WHO HAVE AN OPIOID USE DISORDER -- WE ALSO NOTE THAT THE COST ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. ESTIMATES ARE BASED OFF OF PERCENTAGES THAT WE UNDERSTAND TO BE BASED OFF OF BUT VARIETY OF SOURCES INCLUDING OTHER STATES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN VALIDATED TO REPRESENT THAT CDC OUR POPULATION -- AND ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO ERROR FOR INSTANCE WE NOTE THAT THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO PRESCRIBE THE LOCKS ON THE DRUG DESIGNED TO REVERSE OPIATE OVERDOSE IS. TO OFFENDERS GET BEING RELEASED FROM PRISON -- AND THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH FOR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OFFENDERS FIVE OR THAT WERE -- PROPOSAL NOTES AT ONLY FOUR THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE RELEASED EACH YOUR WITHIN -- BILL USED TO SORT OR THERE ARE POTENTIALLY OTHER ERRORS OF THIS NATURE THROUGHOUT THE PROPOSAL GIVEN THAT A LARGE AMOUNT OF MOVING PARTS INVOLVED -- IN ADDITION THE FULL COST OF IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT IDENTIFIED ADMINISTRATION HAS NOTED THAT THIS -- PROGRAM WOULD TAKE FIVE YEARS TO IMPLEMENT HOW THE PROPOSAL IS ONLY FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS AND IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THE ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS WOULD BE FOR THE FOLLOWING YOURS OR WHAT FUNDING WOULD BE NECESSARY. THERE'S ALSO LIKELY TO BE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS RELATED TO THIS PROPOSAL -- GIVEN THE LARGE INCREASE AND CBT PROGRAMS OF THE CUT CLASSROOMS THE MEDICAL STAFF WHICH WOULD NEED SPACE -- AS WELL AS TREATMENT FOR THE NET. AND MEDICAL DISTRIBUTION -- THERE ALSO POTENTIAL IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES -- AS HAS BEEN NOTED PREVIOUSLY THAT WAS THESE MEDICAL POSITIONS CAN BE DIFFICULT TO FILL THIS WOULD BE A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS -- MORE OF OUR IT IS UNCLEAR HOW EFFECTIVE THE PROPOSAL WOULD BE AT LINKING INDIVIDUALS TO CARE IN THE COMMUNITY. WE NOTE THAT IN THE PROPOSAL IT MENTIONS AT FIFTY SIX COUNTIES HAVE. IMPLEMENTED DIEM CODIS WHICH WOULD EXPAND THE TREATMENT IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE ACCOUNTS ARE VERY STAGED IMPLEMENTATION AND DATA FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. SUGGESTS THAT NUMBER IS ACTUALLY FORTY AND NOT. FIFTY SIX WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE ONLY STATE THAT HAS A STATEWIDE M. A. T. PROGRAMS. HAS GONE AROUND THIS IMPLEMENTATION ISSUE BY HAVING THE SAME PROVIDER PROVIDE SERVICES IN THE PRISON SYSTEM AS IN THE COMMUNITY. AND SO WHAT THAT PROGRAM HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING OVERDOSE DEATHS NOT SURE HOW THE MORE COMPLICATED NATURE NOT BE NECESSARY FOR CALIFORNIA. WOULD BE AT LINKING THESE OFFENDERS TO SERVICES. FINALLY THERE'S ALSO THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE TO THE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY PROGRAMS IT WOULD BE REPLACING THE EXISTING CONTRACTS WITH NEW CONTRACTS IN NEW CURRICULA -- ADDED. WOOD BEES THERE'S ACTUALLY INCREASING THE SIZE TO TREAT A LARGER POPULATION. WE KNOW THAT THESE ARE THE SAME PROGRAMS AT A RECENT AUDIT FOUND -- MORE NOT EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING RECIDIVISM. WE DO NOT FEEL THAT THIS PROPOSAL CONTAINS SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THESE PROGRAMS. PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE LARGE INCREASE. WE ALSO NOTE THAT IN THE PROPOSAL IT MENTIONS THAT SOME OF THAT CONTRACT STOP FOR ACTUALLY BRINGING IN CONTRABAND AND DRUGS. INTO THE PRISONS AND SO IT'S UNCLEAR IF THAT COULD ACTUALLY HAVE IT FOR THEIR ISSUE. AS SUCH DO THE UNTESTED IN HR WE RECOMMEND ADOPTING THIS OUT AS A PILOT -- STARTING WITH THE THREE FACILITIES THAT HAVE CORD AND EIGHTY PILOTS IN PROGRESS. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE PILOT INCLUDE OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT CONTRACTORS FOLLOW BEST PRACTICES AND INDEPENDENT EVALUATION BY RESEARCHERS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF THE PROGRAM ON SUBSTANCE USE IN PRISONS. INMATE HEALTH AND OFFENDER OUTCOMES UPON REENTRY INCLUDING RECIDIVISM AN OVERDOSE DEATHS. BASED ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES WE AT ESTIMATE THAT APPLAUDED SIZE WOULD COST ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN. TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND UNLIKELY TO EXCEED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS AT FULL IMPLEMENTATION. SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE DECIDE TO IMPLEMENT STATEWIDE RATHER THAN DOING A PILOT WE RECOMMEND MODIFICATIONS SUCH AS REQUIRING A MORE GRADUAL IMPLEMENTATION. AN ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT FROM SEA TO SEA ON THE RECEIVE OUR ON THE PROGRAM'S IMPLEMENTATION COSTS. AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION ONCE A PROGRAM IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED. THANK YOU [inaudible] DONE. BY A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND I HAPPEN -- TO HAVE OTHER FOLKS NGUYEN SO inaudible] I'M. I'M WONDERING WHAT THE REACTION WOULD BE TO A PILOT AND IF WE WERE TO OPT TO DO A PILOT. WHAT -- EITHER WHAT NUMBER OF FACILITIES I MEAN. I APPRECIATE ALEJO'S RECOMMENDATION THOUGH IT SEEMED -- I WON'T SAY ARBITRARY BUT THERE THERE WAS A LITTLE JUSTIFICATION AS TO WHICH WHY THE CHOICE OF THE FACILITIES THAT THE LA ALWAYS -- INDICATING AND WHY ONLY THREE SO I GUESS SOMEONE A REACTION TO IF WE WERE TO OPT TO DO A PILOT ONLY WHAT FACILITIES WOULD BE RECOMMENDED AND HOW MANY. MADAM CHAIR ON THE QUESTION OF OF A PILOT -- I GUESS SEVERAL REACTIONS -- THE THE REAL VISIONARY HERE IN THE ROOM ON THIS TOPIC. BUT YOU'LL SENATOR BELL. AND I'M NOT JUST SAYING THAT -- TO BE NICE TO HIM -- EVER NOTICED ME I'VE NEVER BEEN NICE REFERRAL [inaudible] THE NO ALL THIS IS ACTION. I THOUGHT I ALREADY HAD YOUR VOTE WITH DOLE BIGELOW BOLD -- THE THAT'S RIGHT THAT'S WHAT HE SAID [inaudible] AS SENATOR. CONSERVATIVE SENATOR MEL -- ENCOURAGED WITH GREAT UNTIL NATIONALLY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PILOT. FIVE YEARS AGO -- ONE MIGHT SAY HE BROWBEAT THE DEPARTMENT IN ME INTO DOING A PILOT. SO THE IDEA OF DOING A PILOT. WE'VE ALREADY DONE A PILOT -- WE'RE IN THE THIRD YEAR OF THAT WILL BE REPORTING THE LEGISLATURE ON THE RESULTS OF THAT -- IN THE SAUDIS IT WAS AT THREE FACILITY AS WELL TO SEE I AM TO SEE I DON'T. AND A HOUSE OUT OF AN ASSET OF SO WE'RE INTO A THIRD SO WE WE WE ACTUALLY ALREADY I HAVE SOME SENSE. OF THE EFFICACY OF OF THE BASIC TREATMENT PROGRAM -- AND THE PROGRAM THAT WE ARE NOW OFFERING IS BUILT UPON OUR SUCCESS THERE. THE THE SECOND POINT -- DOING A PILOT HERE. DOESN'T REALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM. BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'VE GOT A PATIENTS IN EVERY FACILITY. IT'S NOT LIKE WE DO A PILOT WE'RE GONNA LEARN MUCH ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS SYSTEM WIDE. WE NEED TO ACTUALLY. DO THIS SYSTEM WIDE MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE DID HABSI -- BECAUSE THE PATIENTS -- WILL THE GOAL HERE IS TO ANY PATIENT WHO IS ON THE ALREADY THIS TREATMENT REGIMEN -- WE NEED TO KEEP THEM ALL. WELL THEY'RE GOING TO BE AFTER THEY GO THROUGH OUR RECEIVING A RECEPTION THEY'RE GONNA BE SPRINKLED THROUGHOUT THE DEPARTMENT. WE NEED TO BE ABLE. TO PROVIDE THEM TREATMENT WHERE THEY ARE -- I THINK THE THIRD POINT -- IS. THERE'S AN URGENCY HERE -- THAT SUGGESTS TO ME THAT THE PILOTS THE WRONG RESPONSE. WE HAVE THE HIGHEST DEATH RATE FROM OVERDOSE IN THE COUNTRY AND OUR PRISONS COMPARED TO OTHER PRISONS. THIS LAST YEAR WE HAD EIGHT HUNDRED TRIPS TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR OVER THOSE. AND THIS IS A SPIKE FROM SAY TWO YEARS AGO. SO YOU KNOW WHEN I DO A PILOT. WELL OKAY WE DO A PILOT WE COME BACK IN THREE YEARS WITH THE RESULTS OF THAT -- YOU YOU'RE DOWN FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS ON A PROBLEM THAT IS STARING US IN THE FACE RIGHT NOW. AND I THINK IT'S A PROBLEM OF SUFFICIENT DIMENSION THAT IT CALLS. FOR AN IMMEDIATE. RESPONSE OF THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THOSE BEING PROPOSED. NO QUESTION I AGREE WITH THE LA OWES COMMENTS THEN THERE'S UNCERTAINTY A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY. WELL THERE'S UNCERTAINTY BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVEN'T HAD THIS PROGRAM AT ALL. IN THE PRISONS. SO NATURALLY THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT. LEVEL OF CERTAIN EXPENDITURES. WELL AL I CAN PROMISES THAT AS WE HAVE DONE WITH EVERY PROGRAM WE'VE -- INITIATED -- BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE CONSCIOUS OF OF THE CITY EXPENDITURES OF THIS IS PUBLIC MONEY. OTHER WE NEED TO WORK AS HARD AS THE PHARMACEUTICALS DOWN. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HIRING THAT WE DO WORKS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CONTRACTORS THAT WE HIRE ARE PROPERLY -- A MONITORED AND SUPERVISED. SO YOU KNOW THE THE I THINK THE RESPONSE THAT I WOULD GIVE TO THE UNCERTAINTY ARGUMENT IS. LIVE RECEIVERSHIP OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS HAS DONE A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF IMPLEMENTING A LEVELING OUT. BIG CHANGES. AND I THINK THIS IS SIMPLY GOING TO BE ANOTHER CASE FOR WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT -- FINALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE C. B. T. M. SUPERVISION ACTUALLY WILL BE FINALLY I HAVE ONE MORE FINALLY. A BRITISH BACK -- TO IS A MONITORING OF THAT FUNCTION WITHIN CDC ARE -- I DON'T THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEED FOR EXTERNAL MONITORING OR SPECIAL MONITORING. ON THE SECRETARY DEALS AND I HAVE ALREADY DECIDED TO HAVE -- A STEERING COMMITTEE. OF AB ESSENTIALLY OUR LEVEL. IN A FEW BELOW -- THAT'S GOING TO BE MEETING ROUTINELY UP TO MONITOR AND TRACK PROGRESS A WE'RE GONNA TREAT THIS VERY MUCH AS THOUGH IT WAS A LARGE IT PROJECT -- THAT REQUIRES THAT DEGREE HOME OF EXECUTIVE SUPERVISION AND MONITORING. AND I WOULD NOTE THAT CDC ARE OVER THE LAST DECADE. HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN LARGE IT PROJECTS. BOTH FARMS IN THE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD WERE ENORMOUS PROJECTS THAT REPLACED. I IN THE CASE OF PHAM SOME EIGHTEEN OR TWENTY DIFFERENT IT SYSTEMS WITH ONE SYSTEM. TO TRACK OF VENDORS. AND IT WORKS BEAUTIFULLY. SO I THINK THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY IS IN A GOOD POSITION TO SAY WE WE CAN DO THIS TYPE OF LARGE IMPLEMENTATION. FINAL COMMENT -- IN TERMS OF EXTERNAL EVALUATION -- I DON'T MIND EXTERNAL EVALUATION I DO WONDER WHETHER WE REALLY NEED. OF THE RECEIVERSHIP HAS BEEN AS OPEN AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE ABOUT OUR PERFORMANCE WITH OUR DASHBOARDS ARE REPORTS. I THINK WE HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO EVALUATE -- OUR PERFORMANCE OURSELVES. IF THE PERFORMANCE IS BAD. WE'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT. WE'RE NOT GONNA BE HIDING ANYTHING -- AND TO SOME EXTENT EXTERNAL EVALUATION IS JUST IT ADDS ANOTHER COMPLICATION -- THE ARE FRANKLY WE COULD DO WITHOUT. BUT I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS -- THE YOU MENTION THAT WE HAVE THE HIGHEST OVERDOSE RATE OF IN THE STATE PRISON SYSTEM NOW IT UP RIGHT FACTORED SKEWS ME. DEATHS FROM OVERDOSE YES FROM OVERDOSE OKAY NOW IS THAT FACTORED -- OUR POPULATION SINCE WE ALSO HAVE THE HIGHEST POPULATION IS THAT ARE YOU MEAN THE RATE IN SO YET FACTORS IN THE POPULATION THE RATE IS ABOUT THREE TIMES WHAT THE AVERAGE RADIOS. IN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY -- AND YET. AWAY -- I THINK -- YOUR COMMENTS WERE THAT THERE'S NOT OTHER STATE PRISONS DOING MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT. THERE ARE VERY FEW -- YOU KNOW WHAT'S ON ISLAND. THE WORLD ISLAND. MASSACHUSETTS BUT THOSE ARE THE STATE'S WEARING YELLOW RHODE ISLAND THEIR ENTIRE STATE FACILITY IS ONE BUILDING -- IT'S A LITTLE EASIER FROM THEM -- TO DO SOME OF THE COORDINATION WITH LOCALS SO BY THE THE CHALLENGE AREAS. A CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS. JUST LIKE SOCIETY GENERALLY. IS WHAT ARE WAY BEHIND THE CURVE. ONE ON TREATING THIS RELATIVELY RECENT. OF EXPLOSION IN THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC GIVEN THAT -- THERE'S NOT REALLY OTHER THAN TO MEANT STATE YOU MENTIONED OTHER STATES NECESSARILY USING MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT [inaudible] WHAT -- WHAT THE EXPLAINS OUR HIGH DEATHS? WELL WE HAVE A LOT MORE THAN CERTAINLY PART OF IT IS WE HAVE A LOT MORE DRUGS THAT GET INTO OUR PRISONS. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE ONLY FACTOR BUT AB AND YOUNG DRUGS ARE GETTING IN -- THEY'RE BEING MAILED THEM ON THE BEING BROUGHT IN BY VISITORS THEY'RE BEING BROUGHT IN BY STAFF BOTH CUSTODY AND HEALTHCARE. THEY'RE BEING DROPPED OVER THE FENCE ON IN DRONES. AND WITH SOME OF THE MORE DANGEROUS RECENT -- OR FORMULATIONS OF FENNEL FOR EXAMPLE THE OLD TINY SPECKS IS ALL YOU NEED -- TO GET INTO THE FACILITY. AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO EVEN WITH A FULL BLOWN WE'RE GONNA SEARCH EVERYBODY -- IN THE DRUGS ARE STILL GOING TO GET IN. SO I DON'T KNOW THAT. I'M NO QUESTION IF YOU CAN REDUCE THE PRESENCE OF DRUGS IN THE PRISON. THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING. BUT I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE T SUGGEST THAT. TRYING TO DO THIS ON THE SUPPLY SIDE ONLY. IT ISN'T GOING TO WORK WELL. WE NEED TO HAVE A DEMAND THE SOLUTION AND PART OF THE PROBLEM I RAISE THE ISSUE BECAUSE IF WE LOOK AT HOPE YOUR USE OVER THE COUNTRY. WHILE CALIFORNIA HAS IN TOTAL NUMBERS IT IN THIS IS. WHETHER IT OUTSIDE OF THE INMATE POPULATION [inaudible] FIVE A HEART LAW HI TOTAL NUMBER AS PROPORTION TO THE POPULATION WE ARE STILL LOWER THAN MANY OTHER STATES MANY OTHER STATES ARE EXPERIENCING THE OPIOID CRISIS FAR GREATER THAN WE ARE. SO I REYES SAID IN THAT. YET IT SEEMS TO BE THE OPPOSITE WITH IN OUR PRISON FACILITY AND I PARTLY REYES BECAUSE WELL THIS IS DEALING WITH MEDICALLY SISTER TREATMENT [inaudible] IT -- IF WE SEE OUR NUMBERS. OF PEOPLE USING YOUR FOR YOUR IT'S WITHIN OUR PRISONS INCREASE THEN THE COST TO US FOR THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE. AND EDITION ONLY MY QUESTION WOULD BE. THE SEMI CONNECTED IS. WITH THIS POTENTIALLY LEAD TO MORE DRUGS BEING BROUGHT IN AND IT'S AN INCREASE IN USAGE. WELL HAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE ONE OF THEARM -- ONE THE DATA ELEMENTS THAT WE SHOULD BE MONITORING AND MEASURING FOR SUCCESS. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN. WHAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE IS THAT THE NUMBER OF OF INMATES WHO -- ARE YOU ACTIVELY USING -- OPIOIDS GOES DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. THAT WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED TO THEY'RE ABLE TO BE THERE TREATMENT IS ABLE TO CONTINUE. MAKING IT LESS LIKELY THAT THEY WILL THEM -- COME BACK INTO THE SYSTEM AS PART OF RECIDIVISM. SO WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WHETHER ON WHAT THE YOU KNOW. WHAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED WHICH WOULD BE A BAD SCENARIO A WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WHETHER THAT HAPPENS I DON'T BELIEVE IT WILL HAPPEN THE EXPERIENCE SO FAR AS YOU MENTIONED FOR THREE YEARS YOU HAPPEN TO TESTING THIS? HAS THE NUMBER OF HOPE YOUR USERS GOING DOWN IN THOSE FACILITIES. A COLLECTION DO YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS LAST TIME I LOOKED AT THIS WAS ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO MY RECOLLECTION IS THAT THE NUMBERS HAVE GONE DOWN -- AND I BELIEVE ON RECIDIVISM MAY STILL BE TOO EARLY FOR TELL EARLY IN TWO SMALL [inaudible] FROM. WE KNOW THAT THE THE INMATES WHO HAVE BEEN PART OF THE PROGRAM. AND WE DO HAVE TO DISTRICT SHOWING THAT I THINK IT'S 6270% HAVE STAYED ON THE TREATMENT PROGRAM. SO TO THAT EXTENT -- THAT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL ENOUGH PROBABLY ALL YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE MEASURE IN A THREE YEAR PILOT ANYWAY. A YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SHOW OF OF RECIDIVISM WHERE YOUR TOTAL -- PILOT POPULATION IS A HUNDRED HUNDRED AND FIFTY YOU JUST TALK A SEAT ON IMPACT WITH THOSE IN SMALL NUMBERS. CAN YOU DESCRIBE OTHER IN THIS OBVIOUSLY COVERING ALL FACILITIES WHAT ABOUT THE PROPOSAL THAT YOU'VE BROUGHT BEFORE US IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING IN THE THREE FACILITIES THAT YOU ARE CURRENTLY USING. MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT -- I MAY TURN THE DOCTOR CAME IN FOR THAT DESCRIPTION GOOD THAT WILL NOT TO WANT TO MISS STATE -- ELEMENTS OF THE PROGRAM. YEAH NO I THINK THIS IS A A MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH WE'RE REALLY FOCUSING ON THAT THE THREE BIG PATIENT POPULATIONS THAT ARE AT THE HIGHEST RISK. FOR DEATH AND SO WHAT WE'D BE DOING IS CONTINUING PATIENTS ON MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT AS THEY COME FROM THE THE COUNTY JAILS -- WERE ALSO HAVE A DEVELOPER VERY ROBUST PROCESS TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS. WHO ARE CURRENTLY WITH US PAGE FIFTEEN OF YOUR? AT THE BOTTOM CONTINUE. THE SECOND GROUP OF PATIENTS ARE REALLY THE THE FOLKS WHO HAVE ALREADY DECLARED THEMSELVES AT HIGH RISK -- WHO HAVE OVERDOSED AT LEAST ONCE? I ON ON A ON A DRUG. OR HAVE SOME OTHER COMPLICATION RELATED TO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER -- SORT SO FOR EXAMPLE WE SEE SPINAL ABSCESSES OR INFECTIONS OF THE HEART ENDOCARDITIS. AND THEN THE THIRD GROUP THAT'S THAT'S REALLY DIFFERENT AND THE THE BIG DIFFERENCE IS WE'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSING. ON THE PATIENTS WHO ARE LEADING US IN THE NEXT FIFTEEN TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS. OUR GONNA DO. SCREENING ON EVERYONE OF THOSE PATIENTS LEAVING IF THEY SCREEN POSITIVE WILL BE DOING OF KIND OF A RISK ASSESSMENT FROM A CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE. AND BASED ON THAT ASSESSMENT IF THEY'RE MODERATE TO HIGH RISK -- WE WILL -- DETERMINE THEIR TREATMENT NEEDS USING THE A SAM CRY TERRY THIS IS THE COMMUNITY A STANDARD IF YOU WILL -- TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY NEED pI'M SORRY INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT OR OUTPATIENT. I AND THEN WE WILL START THEM ON A TREATMENT REGIMENT IF THEY'RE APPROPRIATE FOR MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT WILL START THEM ON THE MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT. AND REFER THEM TO TO D. R. P. FOR A COUNTY BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND THEY'LL RECEIVE THAT TREATMENT. FOR AN AVERAGE OF OF TWELVE MONTHS. AND SEVERAL MONTHS PRIOR TO DISCHARGE OF THROUGH OUR NURSING SERVICES OUR WHOLE PERSON CARE -- WE WE GETTING THEM READY TO TRANSITION EITHER TWO THREE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION OR PAROLE -- WE WILL BE WORKING. TO GET THEM AT CONNECTED IF YOU WILL FOR THEIR FIRST APPOINTMENTS INCLUDING AS SHE D. T.. AS WELL AS WORKING WITH OTHERS TO SECURE HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER SORT OF UNNECESSARY SOCIAL SERVICES. SO IT'S MUCH MORE COMPREHENSIVE REALLY FOCUSING ON THESE THESE LARGE GROUPS OF OF PATIENCE VERY HIGH RISK -- INCLUDING ESPECIALLY THE LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO WE LIVE LEAVING US IN THE NEXT FIFTEEN EIGHTEEN MONTHS WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE AT VERY HIGH RISK OF DEATH. IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF OF FOR LEASE. AND WE ALSO A NO THEN -- MANY OF THE COUNTIES ALTHOUGH IT'S NOT ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES MANY OF THE COUNTIES HAVE PUT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO TAKE CARE OF THESE FOLKS SO IT GIVES US SOME TIME TO PUT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. WE CAN FOCUS ON THOSE LEAVING GET THEM TREATMENT GIVEN CONNECTED -- TO BEAR TRANSITION SERVICES AND THEIR FIRST APPOINTMENTS -- PARTICULARLY THOSE COUNTIES THAT HAVE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE WHICH FORTUNATELY IS WHERE ABOUT 70% OF OUR PATIENTS ARE RELEASED. RECEIVED -- MY COLLEAGUES HAVE QUESTIONS CENTER MORE LIKE. MR KELSO -- JUST BECAUSE I AM THE NEW PERSON HERE YOU YOU WERE APPOINTED BY A FEDERAL JUDGE CORRECT YES. AND TO DEAL WITH THE HEALTH CARE IN THE PRISON SYSTEM WITH MEDICAL CARE MEDICAL CARE. BUT NOT. TO DEAL WITH THE POPULATION OF THE PRISON WOULD THAT BE A DIFFERENT FEDERAL JUDGE OR IS THAT THE SAME JUDGE. WE WE'VE BEEN MANDY OVERCROWDING LOS WELL THE OVERCROWDING. OVERCROWDING IS WHAT'S CALLED OF THOSE ARE THE THREE JUDGE PANEL. THAT DEALS WITH OVERCROWDING ISSUES SO THAT WOULD NOT BE -- MY RESPONSIBILITY BUT YOU'RE STILL REPORTING TO THE SAME FEDERAL JUDGE THAT YOU STARTED WITH -- ON THE DIFFERENT FEDERAL JUDGE JUDGE -- HENDERSON -- TO SEVERAL YEARS AGO RETIRED WHAT BAND -- AT THIS POINT -- THERE'S A NEW FEDERAL JUDGE THING FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN SAN FRANCISCO GAY AND SO. IN IN THE MEANTIME. LIFE IS CHANGING THINGS REVOLVING WE HAVE NEW DRUGS. AND THAT'S PART OF YOUR MANDATE THEN. TO YES WHAT WHAT LITTLE THE APPROACH THAT THAT BUT I'VE TAKEN A IS TO TRY -- TO SET AS THE STANDARD FOR OUR PERFORMANCE. COMMUNITY STANDARDS OF CARE. SO IT'S NOT ANYTHING THAT WE MAKE UP WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. AND CERTAINLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS HAS BEEN IN THE CONTEXT OF S. UT T.. HAS BEEN A REAL CRYSTALLIZATION OF A NEED FOR A BETTER MEDICAL RESPONSE TO OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. SO I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER IT'S STYLE DRIFTER IF IT'S YOU KNOW. PART OF THE JOB DESCRIPTION BECAUSE WE'RE DEALING WITH SYMPTOMS AND NOT THE ROOT CAUSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON SO YOU'VE EXPLAINED. THAT THIS IS COMING INTO THE PRISON SYSTEM THROUGH DRONES OR WHO KNOWS HOW -- OUR OUR OUR INMATES REQUIRED TO DO A URINE TEST EVERY [inaudible] FEW DAYS [inaudible] THERE'S DEPENDING ON THE ON THIS BIG FOR D. AFTER JUST I GUESS I WILL NOT MISS SPEAKING -- UNDER OUR DIVISION OF A DAHLE INSTITUTIONS DEPENDING ON THE JOB THAT THE INMATE HAS THEY WILL BE REQUIRED TO DRUG TEST AND IN OUR TREATMENT PROGRAMS THERE'S A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION IS PARTICIPATING IN TREATMENT. THAT WOULD BE DRUG TESTED BUT OUR PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW AGAIN -- JUST GEARED TOWARDS THE END OF THE INCARCERATIONS SO. NOT THE ENTIRE POPULATION AMPLY DESTRUCTIVE. HI JENNIFER BRANHAM. DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS I'D LIKE TO HELP ADDRESS THE QUESTION ON THE ANALYSIS. WE DO HAVE RANDOM URINALYSIS REQUIREMENTS OF ALL INMATES BUT THOSE THAT ARE IN PROGRAMS OR AS PART OF THE IS THIS A MEATY ARM TREATMENT THERAPY. THEY HAVE A A HEIGHTENED REQUIREMENTS BEYOND THE RANDOM. WELL I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I GET TO EXPLAIN THIS TO CONSTITUENTS RIGHT RIGHT THAT WE'RE SPENDING MORE MONEY TO PROVIDE. ASSISTANCE AND BY KIDS TEACHERS ARE GONNA GO. HOW DO YOU OVERDOSE IN A PRISON HOW DOES THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S THE FIRST THING WE GOT UP TRYING TO FIGURE OUTSIDE [inaudible] YOU KNOW. SO I SO IT WE'VE GOT IT AND I'M JUST TRYING. TO UNDERSTAND HOW CAN YOU HELP THE PRISON SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THAT DRUGS DON'T GET IN WHICH IS YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT IT'S SOMEHOW NOT HAPPENING BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THAT'S THE FRONT LINE RATE. YES AND AND THAT WOULD BE BEYOND THE SCOPE OF FOR MY AUTHORITY AND THE FEDERAL CASE OKAY -- AMAYA FORTY SIMPLY IS IF YOU HAVE A AN INMATE WHO HAS A MEDICAL PROBLEM. MAKE SURE THEY GET TREATED APPROPRIATELY AND AN OVERDOSE IS CONSIDERED A MEDICAL PROBLEM YES IT CERTAINLY OKAY I JUST. WANNA MAKE SURE I GOT DEFINITIONS YES CORRECT SO THEN IT DOES BECOME A MANDATE. AND SO YOU'RE NOT REALLY ASKING US FOR MONEY YOU'RE KIND OF ORDERING US. WELL UP TO BE A LITTLE CLEARER THIS IS A A A BUDGET REQUEST -- OF FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. SO THIS IS GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S PROGRAM -- I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE TWO HELP PROVIDE [inaudible] EXPERTISE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WOULD SUCH A PROGRAM LOOK LIKE. BUT AS I'M SITTING HERE TODAY THIS IS I MEAN DEPARTMENT FINANCE WOULD CONCUR THIS IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. OKAY SOLD IT'S NOT MANDATED BY THE FEDERAL JUDGE [inaudible] NOT YET [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. NOW IS THAT A PREDICTION OR THREAT. IT'S NOT A THREAT CERTAINLY -- AND IT'S ALSO NOT A PREDICTION. BECAUSE OF THE JUDGE DOESN'T SHARE HIS VIEWS WITH ME ABOUT SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN YEP BEFORE THE COURT -- IT HAS ANY IT IS AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN RAISED IN THE LITIGATION. BY THE PLAINTIFFS. AM THE BY OF THREE CHORD EXPERTS. OF WHO THE COURT HAS APPOINTED. SO IT'S CLEARLY AN ISSUE THAT IN GENERAL TERMS IS BEFORE THE COURT -- MY OWN SENSE IS GIVEN -- WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE COMMUNITY THAT IT'S BEING RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A? MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEM -- IN THE TREATMENT THIS IS THE THE STANDARD TREATMENT NOW THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE COMMUNITY. I THINK IF THE ISSUE WERE PUSHED REFER THE COURT THE COURT WOULD HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME. IN NOT DIRECTING ME. TO IMPLEMENT SUCH A PROGRAM. BUT WHAT YOU'RE GETTING NOW IS JUST MY LEGAL CONCLUSION MIKE GAS ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THIS WERE LITIGATED. UNFORTUNATELY IN MY JUDGMENT OF THE ADMINISTRATION DECIDED. THIS IS A GOOD PROGRAM WE SHOULD DO IT. AND IT MAY BE THE ADMINISTRATION'S DECIDED WELL BECAUSE THEY AGREE WITH SORT OF AT LEGAL ANALYSIS THAT IN FACT. THIS IS A MEDICAL ILLNESS YOU HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT TO TREATED. BUT I DON'T WANT TO TRY TO SPEAK FOR THE ADMINISTRATION ON THEIR JUSTIFICATION I'M JUST DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU. I AM ON THE BUDGET AT THIS POINT WHAT'S MORE OF A PROACTIVE POSTURE AS AND WITH THAT YOU'RE SUPPORTING AS OPPOSED TO HAVING. TO HAVE US BEREACTIVE BY A FEDERAL JUDGE HE I THINK THAT'S A VERY FAIR WHERE I'M DESCRIBING AN END SIMPLY MY REACTION -- TO THE NUMBER OF DEATHS -- THAT I THINK CAN BE AVOIDED BY IMPLEMENTING THIS TYPE OF A PROGRAM AND I KNOW SOMETIMES DEATHS OF INMATES -- AND THE FACT THAT EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM ARE HAVING OVERDOSES SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT VIEW THAT. WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY. BUT I AM REQUIRED TO VIEW THAT WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY WE HAVE REDUCED AFFORDABLE DEATHS. IN EVERY OTHER CATEGORY. THIS ONE NOW -- IT POPS UP AND SO I DO FEEL A SENSE OF URGENCY ABOUT RESPONDING TO THIS CRISIS. WAS A LAY PERSON I WOULD SEE A PRISON AS A LARGE DETOX CENTER. AS OVER A MUCH IN THE SAME WAY THAT -- IN THE PRISONS ARE NOW WERE YOU PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. BUT IT IT BE GREAT TO HAVE DETOX IN A A LITTLE OF A TREATMENT BUT AS LONG TERM. SO THAT WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED THEY CAN CONTINUE ON THAT TREATMENT WAS NOT JUST DETOX IS ACTUALLY LONG TERM CHRONIC TREATMENT -- HOPEFULLY IN THE END OF BEING ONE REASON WHY MAYBE THAT PERSON CAN BE SUCCESSFUL ON THE OUTSIDE. SO IF I GET CANCER WHILE I'M IN PRISON THAT'S ONE THING BUT IF I CHOOSE TO TAKE DRUGS. PATTERSON AGAIN THAT'S ALL THAT'S A SELF CHOICE I HAVE NOW. CREATED A HEALTH PROBLEM. AT MY CHOICE. DO I THEN BECOME RESPONSIBLE TO PAY FOR THE DRUGS SAID YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ME TO OFFSET. THAT DO I HAVE SOME KIND OF RESPONSIBLE TO REIMBURSE TO TAXPAYERS OR IS ADDICTION CONSIDERED. AN ILLNESS AND THEREFORE THE EVERYTHING IS KICK THIS PAID FOR FOR FREE ADDICTION IS CONSIDERED -- MOVED TO BE AN ILLNESS IN MUCH THE SAME WAY AS DIABETES. YOU COULD ARGUE THAT THE ARE DIABETICS I HAVE MADE A CHOICE. THEY EAT TOO MUCH SUGAR. THEY DON'T EXERCISE. OF SO WELL WILL WIRE WHY DON'T THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR DIABETIC TREATMENT WELL THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS IN THE FREE WORLD EITHER -- YOU. DIABETIC COMES TO A DOCTOR NEEDS MEDICALLY NECESSARY TREAT. THIS IS THIS IS VERY MUCH BUTTE AT THIS POINT AS SIMILAR TO THAT. OF SOMEBODY WHO HAS THE SORT OF AN ADDICTION ACTUALLY HANDLES OF CHEMICAL CHANGES. IN THEIR BRAIN. THAT ADDICTS THEM THAT MAKES THE CRAVING FOR THE DRUG WAS. ABSOLUTELY IRRESISTIBLE. NOT EXACTLY THE SAME WAY BUT IN SOMEWHAT THE SAME WAY THAT I'VE GOT A CRAVING FOR THAT NEXT CANDY BAR -- THOUGH IT IS VIEWED AS A MEDICAL ILLNESS. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME ASK QUESTIONS ONE A ONE MR KELSO THANK YOU MANAGER. CERTAINLY. I'M. WHAT I WANTED -- TO REYES. FIVE THE CLARIFICATION OF ITS ADMINISTRATIVE PROPOSAL. I'M WE THE SUBCOMMITTEE HAS BEEN APPROVING OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS INCREASING ALLOCATIONS. FOR I'M WILL CALL INTERDICTING OR WHERE FOR NOTES THAT ANYWAY TRYING TO KEEP THE DRUGS OUT. AND IT SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY. AND YET EVEN WITH OUR INCREASES OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS WHERE WE HAVE AMPED UP. FIVE DRUG SNIFFING DOG SCREENINGS -- SEARCHES A WHOLE VARIETY OF THINGS WE ARE SEEING. THIS DRAMATIC INCREASE AN OVERDOSE DEATHS SO. DO YOU KNOW ONE WOULD HAVE TO SAY. THAT SO FAR ARE EXPENDITURES ON TRYING TO PREVENT THE DRUGS FROM COMING IN. HAVE YOU MET MAYBE IF WE HAD NONE OF FOR THEM WE DO HAVE WRITTEN MORE OVERDOSES BUT THERE ISN'T THAT A GREAT CORRELATION BETWEEN OUR EXPENDITURES IN TRYING TO STOP THE DRUGS FROM COMING IN. AND A REDUCTION IN OVERDOSES AN OVERDOSE DEATHS. SO -- HI I THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE FOR US TO LOOK AT I MEAN IT IT. IT MAKES NO SENSE ON THE ONE HAND THAT. PEOPLE WOULD OVERDOSE IMPRISONED AND YET THAT IS THE CIRCUMSTANCE WE HALF -- SO AS I THINK FOR FOR ME THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURE. IT'S THERE ARE WHAT APPEARS. AND CLEARLY STAFF CAN TALK MORE TO THE RECEIVER NUMBERS OR TO THE ADMINISTRATION. IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE LA OWES -- WHAT THE HIGHLIGHTED REGARDING -- THE FIVE MILLION. FOUR I NALOXONE FOR THOSE WHO ARE BEING RELEASED AS MAY BE -- A NUMBER THAT COULD BE ADJUSTED CONSIDERING THAT WE HAVE BY THEIR OWN ESTIMATES ONLY -- FOUR THOUSAND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PEOPLE BEING RELEASED EACH YEAR SO BECAUSE OF A VARIETY OF THINGS LIKE THAT I WANNA HOLD IT OPEN I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME. TO GET SOME OF THIS NAIL DOWN BUT CLEARLY I THINK WE DO WANT TO GET IT NAILED DOWN BEFORE WE WOULD -- ACT. UGH BUT THE FINAL QUESTION I WOULD HAVE -- BEFORE WE JUST HOLD IT OPEN. IS HOW CAN WE ENSURE I MEAN THERE'S YOU KNOW PART OF THIS IS THAT CAN FOR CONTINUITY OF CARE ONCE THE RELEASED. AND THAT'S WHAT THE NLOXONE DOSES ARE. FOR GIVING PEOPLE WHEN THEY LEAVE BUT WHAT IN WHAT WAYS THIS IS KIND OF PREDICATED ON THAT ONCE THE PERSON IS RELEASED THAT THERE. THERE ARE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WOULD CONTINUE TO BE TREATED SO IN WHAT WAYS DO IS THIS. PROGRAM ENSURING THAT. IF AT ALL. I THINK DOCTOR KING INCOMES BE TO THAT BECAUSE THAT'S BEEN ONE OF OUR BIGGEST FOCUSES AS HOW WE COORDINATE THIS WITH LOCAL PROVIDERS. PARTICULARLY IN THOSE FIRST TWO WEEKS SO THAT YOU CAN GET THE CONNECTION MADE WHEN THEM AT THAT POINT YOU KNOW YOUR PATERNAL RESPONSIBILITY TO ON THE THE PATIENT AND LOCAL PROVIDERS BUT DR GAININGCAM EXPLAIN WHERE WE ARE ON THAT. YES AGAIN I THINK SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT WE REQUESTED PARTICULARLY THE NURSING RESOURCES AND SOME OF THE SOCIAL WORKER OUT RESOURCES. A VERY SPECIFICALLY ARE TARGETING -- PATIENTS WHO ARE LEAVING BOTH ON COMMUNITY SUPERVISION AND A SUBSET OF THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE LEAVING THROUGH PAROLE -- TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY PROVIDERS AND TO GET THOSE PATIENTS CONNECTED TO THEIR FIRST APPOINTMENTS ALONG WITH THE SOCIAL SERVICES THE WRAPAROUND SOCIAL SERVICES. I WILL SAY THAT -- AGAIN IN OUR PILOT THE TWO PILOTS INSTITUTIONS ONE OF THE REALLY BIG SUCCESS STORIES PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT. LESSON LEARNED FROM THOSE PILOTS IS THAN US JUST USING A SMALL NUMBER OF SOCIALWORKERS WITH THE ADDICTION SPECIALIST DEVELOPING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS OUT IN THE COUNTIES. WE WERE ABLE TO GET -- ALMOST COMMUNITY RESOURCES AND THOSE FIRST APPOINTMENTS AND THAT IS. THREE TO FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN WE SEE -- WITHOUT THOSE -- TRANSITION RESOURCES REALLY HELPING THAT PERSON HAND OVER HAND MAKE THOSE APPOINTMENTS SO -- WE DO A VERY POOR JOB QUITE FRANKLY -- BUT WITH THESE PILOTS AND THAT MODEL WHERE WE HAVE A SOCIAL WORKER THE NURSES AND THE ADDICTION SPECIALIST -- WE DID CONNECT THOSE PATIENTS AT IN ABOUT 76% WHICH IS VERY VERY HIGH. RIGHT SO BEFORE A ASK FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IS THERE ANY OTHER COMMON OR QUESTIONS BY DEPARTMENT FINANCE CáC C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;G&lt;/c&gt;</u> COME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK I WOULD JUST ECHO THE RECEIVERS COMMENTS ON THIS BEING AN ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL -- THE DEATH RATE HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY THAT'S AN IMPORTANT FACTOR INTO HOW WE RECOGNIZE WHERE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES MAY BE NEEDED -- I THINK THE RECEIVERS. FOCUS ON THIS PROGRAM IS DEFINITELY NECESSARY GIVEN THE ENERGY INTEGRATION WITH THAT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM GENERALLY SO WELL THERE'S DEFINITELY OVERLAP IN APPEARANCE OF MAYBE EXPANSION AND ACTIVITIES I THINK -- THE THE RECEIVER STAY FOCUSED ON THE ISSUE OF THE DEATH RATE IN ADDRESSING THAT I THINK THERE'S QUITE A BIT IN THIS PROPOSAL THAT HASN'T BEEN THIS DISCUSSED IN DEPTH TODAY THAT IS ACTUALLY. RELATED TO CDC ARE PROPER AND I THINK THOSE ARE ALSO -- VERY IMPORTANT RESOURCES TO MAKING AN EFFECTIVE PROGRAM SO THAT'S IT. I'M PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE SIDE OF YES PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR IN COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MARIE SALINAS CHIEF OPERATING ALSO FOR CENTERPOINT. BUT I'M HERE REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES -- AND I WANT TO PRESENT OUR COLLECTIVE VIEW. ON THIS PROPOSAL WHICH WILL AIR. IN FAVOR OF MOST OF THIS PROPOSAL -- IF IT'S A LONG WE CAN YOU CAN GIVE IT TO US IN WRITING BECAUSE WE ARE HOLDING IT OPEN. IF YOU WANT TO STIR SUMMARIZE AND AND GIVE US THE COMMENTS IN WRITING THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED WE WILL PRESENT A FORMAL LETTER TO THE OFFICER WILL BE DELIVERED TODAY AND I WILL SUMMARIZE IT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT CAP HE SUPPORTS AS THE CONFERENCE OF YOUR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. AND A TREATABLE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITION AS A TREATABLE HEALTH CONDITION. THE INCLUSION OF A FULL RANGE OF FOOD OF FTA DRUGS. APPROVED MEDICATED ASSISTED TREATMENT FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS. AND HOPE YOUR USE DISORDER. THE INCLUSION OF RECESS A STRATIFICATION TREATMENT STAGING THE ISSUE OF THE PEOPLE WITH THE HIGHEST NEED A PART I HAVE. FOR SERVICES AS A SYSTEM IS DEVELOPED AND EFFORTS THAT PARALLEL. AND FEED INTO THE STATE'S COMMUNITY BASED DRUG AND ALCOHOL% ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM I'LL SUMMARIZE THE OTHER AREAS. KATHY HAS QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ABOUT THE FOLLOWING THINGS. LACK OF ALIGNMENT WITH THE STATE -- DMC ODS SYSTEM AND CREATE AN INCREASE COSTS AND COMPLEXITY. CURRENTLY -- DOES PROPOSAL THAT NURSES PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE WORK IS GOING TO BE ADMINISTERED. THIS IS NOT TRADITIONAL WORKED AT NURSES DO -- THIS TRADITIONALLY DONE BY CERTIFIED COUNCILS. AND BY -- LICENSED CLINICIANS. OUR NURSES RECEIVED VERY LITTLE. EDUCATION. OUR ON SUBSTANCE USE OUR TREATMENT. AND A PROPOSES THE FOR COMPARING -- THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROPOSAL IS GOING TO BE A REALLY HAVE A HEAVY LIFT IS NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE WE WE ARE WE ENCOURAGED INCREASE SALARIES. THAT ARE NEAR TO BE COMPETITIVE THE HARD TO STAFF. HOWEVER THERE JUST ISN'T THE WORK FORCE CURRENTLY IN THE STATE SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A PHASED IN APPROACH RATHER THAN. JUST TO MAKE IT WHERE EVERYBODY HAS TO BE CERTIFIED IS GOING TO BE REALLY DIFFICULT STAFF ARE WE REALLY ENCOURAGED THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE LOCKS ALL. IN THE PRISONS NOT JUST AT THIS CHARGE. WE DO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM WITH -- MH OVERDOSING WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED FROM PRISON. HOWEVER AS YOU CAN HEAR THE NUMBERS THERE'S A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE OLD B. AND IN THE PRESENCE. SO WE DON'T WANT IT JUST TO BE -- ADMINISTRATIVE DISCHARGE. BUT WHILE THE IN THE PRISONS IS VERY LITTLE RISK. OF ABUSE ALL HALL FROM INMATES HAPPEN THE LOCKS ALL. THE AVAILABILITY AND UNLOCKS ON I'LL LAVE IT AT THAT AND OUT MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET A COPY. OF THE FULL PRESENTATION. AND IF WE CAN GET THAT SOONER THAN LATER AS WE'LL CALL YOU YOU WILL GET IT TODAY WE AREMEETING AGAIN ON THURSDAY YOU WILL GET IT TODAY. WILL BE DELIVERED TODAY OKAY. SO ON THE WHOLE THIS ITEM OPEN AND WE ARE GOING TO RECESS NOW. AND WE WILL RETURN AT START THE PRESENTATION TO OUR OTHER MEMBER JOINS US. BUT THE ITEM THAT. THE ITEM THAT WE'RE GONNA GO. TO IS -- ITEM ZERO EIGHT TWENTY UNDER DOJ ISSUE TWENTY SIX SO IF WE HAVE -- ANYONE FROM DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO PRESENT. THAT WOULD BE GREAT THEY CAN COME TO THE TABLE NOW. EXCELLENT SO -- I PUT THE GAVEL DOWN BUT I DIDN'T FORMALLY SAY. OUR PUBLIC SAFETY ARE RATHER OUR SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE SEVEN FIVE PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE JUDICIARY IS RETURNED FROM RECESS. AND WE ARE STARTING WITH -- ITEM ZERO EIGHT TWENTY DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ISSUE TWENTY SIX PAYMENT OF SETTLEMENTS AND JUDGMENTS GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CHRIS RYAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. ON THIS ISSUE RELATES TO A BILL THAT WAS PASSED -- BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN IT WAS AB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE IT WAS AND AN ACTOR REQUIRED CERTAIN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CARE FACILITIES. TO MAKE CERTAINDISCLOSURES TO CLIENTS OR PTENTIAL CLIENTS. IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING FIVE CASES A PLAINTIFF OR A GROUP OF PLAINTIFFS MOUNTED OF FREE SPEECH -- AND OR FREEDOM OF RELIGION CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE TO THE ACT. NAMING -- AGP SIR AS A DEFENDANT ALTHOUGH THE ACT WAS NEVER ENFORCED BY THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE -- THESE LAWSUITS FOR TO PREVENT THE APPLICATION OF AB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE OR THE PLAINTIFFS IN THESE FIVE CASES DID NOT SEEK MONETARY DAMAGES. AND WE'RE SEEKING ONLY TO INVALIDATE THE ACT. PLAINTIFFS EVENTUALLY SUCCEEDED IN INVALIDATING THE ACT BY TAKING THE LEAD CASE -- WHICH IS THE NTIONAL INSTITUTE OF FAMILY AND LIFE ADVOCATES PEOPLE SERRA. TO THE SUPREME COURT THE JUNE TWENTY EIGHTEEN US SUPREME COURT DECISION AND THE FLORA THE THE SERRA RULED THAT THE DEVIL PLAINTIFFS WERE ENTITLED TO A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION. AGAINST ENFORCEMENT OF THE ACT EFFECTIVELY SECURING VICTORY FOR THE ALL THE PLAINTIFFS IN ALL THE CASES. THIS ISSUE -- IN THE MAY REVISE IS FOR TWO POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO PAY THOSE ATTORNEYS FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PLAINTIFFS [inaudible] YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- I WOULD WIN WIN OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL WAS HERE I ASKED HIM SPECIFICALLY WHAT. DID HE SPENT WITH HIS DEPARTMENT IS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT. YOU KNOW ALL THESE ACTIVITIES AND AND THE EMAIL THAT WE GOT BACK WAS EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO TAXPAYERS PAID. TO OUR STAFF IS IT THE AG'S OFFICE AND NOW WE'RE GONNA SPEND ANOTHER TWO POINT ONCE WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO THREE MILLION. FOR FOR ONE PARTICULAR BILL THAT YOU KNOW YOU CAN KIND OF SEE WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL FROM THE GET GO YOU DIDN'T I'M NOT A LAWYER BUT YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THAT THERE'S GONNA BE SOME TROUBLE WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL. SO I JUST WONDER. WHAT DEPARTMENT BEARS THE BRUNT OF THIS TWO POINT ONE MILLION IS IT? WHO THE WHAT WHAT WHERE DOES IT COME FROM BORDERS ORDER WHO'S PAYING THIS FOR THIS FOR THIS IS A TO YOUR POINT -- EARLIER THERE WAS THE STAFF TIME ASSOCIATED WITH THE ATTORNEYS AND THAT WAS THE THE EMAIL THAT WE SHARED WITH THE STAFF -- THE COSTS I THINK WAS EIGHT HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND THIS IS TO PAY THOSE SETTLEMENT FEES FOR THE THE PLAINTIFFS AND SO. TYPICALLY THIS WOULD BE THROUGH THE CLAIMS BILL PROCESS -- AND SO THESE TYPES OF CASES ARE PAID THROUGH THAT CLAIM SO PROCESS BECAUSE THESE PAYMENTS ARE DUE -- AND I END UP LOOKING TO DEPARTMENT FINANCE FOR TIMING ON THIS BUT THESE THESE PAYMENTS ARE DUE PROBABLY EARLIER THAN THE NEXT CLAIMS WILL PROCESS OF DOING AVOID PAYING ADDITIONAL INTEREST AND AND PENALTIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT ON THESE. SETTLED -- AGREEMENTS -- IT WAS PUT INTO THE BUDGET -- THE MAY REVIVE I GUESS CHRIS THAT THE QUESTION IS DOES IT COME OUT OF THE DOJ'S BUDGET. NUMBER SIX OKAY NOW I'M OUT OF A DO WE SELF INSURE FOR THESE. ARE THESE ARE TYPICALLY PAID -- FROM A GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION OR OTHER SPECIAL FUNDS IN THE CLAIMS BILL PROCESS BUT THERE'S A SPECIAL DEPARTMENT ON THAT BUDGETS ITS CLAIMS. THERE'S A YOU WANNA. FINANCE FINANCE THANK YOU -- TYPICALLY THAT CLEANS BILL -- WHEN IT GOES THROUGH IT'LL SAY IT IS HEREBY APPROPRIATED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO PAY FOR THESE VERY SPECIFIC CLAIMS -- I THINK THERE WAS JUST ONE THAT HAPPENED -- THIS PAST COUPLE MONTHS AGO SB FOUR EIGHTEEN DID VERY SIMILAR THING WHENEVER THERE'S SETTLEMENTS AGAINST THE STATE. IT'S TYPICALLY PAY FOR OUT OF DIRECT APPROPRIATIONS FROM A CLAIMS BELL -- WE DO ALSO INCLUDE THEM IN THE BUDGET THOUGH DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF WHEN THEY'RE DO AND THE TIMING OF WHEN THE CLING STILL HAPPENS -- AT THE SOURCE OF THE FUNDS IN THE CLAIMS BILL WOULD BE -- IT'S I CAN BE IT CAN VERY I THINK -- IT CAN BE GENERAL FUND I THINK MOST COMMONLY IS GENERAL FUND BUT DEPENDING ON I'M AN ACCOUNTANT SO I'M USED TO A CHART OF ACCOUNTS. SO WHAT ACCOUNT IS IT COMING OUT OF THIS COME OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY. ADMINISTRATIVE ACCOUNT IS A THE BILL CAME OUT OF THERE. NOW IT WOULD -- IT WOULD COME JUST OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND POT THAT WE HAVE FOR THE STATE IS THAT WHATEVER IS IN THE RESERVES IN THE GENERAL FUND. IS WHAT COMES OUT OF ITS NOT BUDGET OTHER. YEAH IT'S NOT REALLY BUDGETED FOR LIKE SPECIFIC DEPARTMENTS OR SPECIFIC CATEGORIES OR ANYTHING IT'S JUST KIND OF WHAT WE LEARNED FROM FROM THIS HOW IT DOES THIS HAPPEN OFTEN WHERE WE DO A BILL AND IT GOES ALL THE WAY THROUGH AND GETS BEAT UP AT THE STATE. U. S. SUPREME COURT IN THIS CASE. AND SO NOW WE HAVE TO SPEND THREE MILLION. FOR IT WOULD HOW DO WE HOW DO WE LEARN FROM THAT BECAUSE AT THAT COULD GET EXPENSIVE -- WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME RIGHT. YEAH THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I THINK -- THE IDEA THAT HE MIGHT BE BETTER BECAUSE THEY DO ARE THEY ARE THE PEOPLE THAT DO REPRESENT THE STATE BUT I WILL SAY THAT CLEANS WHEELS OFF -- TO HAPPEN PRETTY OFTEN I MEAN IT IS TWICE A YEAR WHERE WE HAVE CLAIMS AGAINST THE STATE -- THAT ARE APPROPRIATE IN THE CLAIMS BILL USUALLY ONE SPRING ONE IN THE FALL -- ANYTHING THERE'S USUALLY A NUMBER OF SETTLEMENTS BUT DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE. YEAH I MEAN JUST ADDED THAT THERE ARE VARIOUS CLAIMS THAT COME THROUGH THE THE PROCESS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR -- ON ON VARIOUS MATTERS SOMETIMES IT'S THAT LEGISLATION -- SOMETIMES IT'S A LOSS -- DUE TO YOU NATURAL DISASTER AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO IT VARIES QUITE A BIT I I THINK IT'S BEEN QUITE AWHILE SINCE WE'VE SEEN ONE LIKE THIS. LIKE THIS -- BUT WE WILL KEEPTRACK OF IT AND CAN YOU SHARE WITH YOUR STAFF IN THE FUTURE -- BUT HI I JUST. IT'S ALWAYS THAT ERRORS THE GULF A MAN THIS IS GOING TO BE INTRANSIGENT BUT ABOUT FORTY MAYBE THEY'LL MAYBE IT WAS LITTLE -- WHAT WE NEED TO COOK A LITTLE MORE OR WHATEVER YOU KNOW YEAH HERE AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE PROCESS? AND THEN HERE IS A LIVE YOU KNOW TO TO TRY TO EXPERIMENT IT GETS PRETTY EXPENSIVE AND TIME I JUST WANTED. TO FIGURE OUT. YOU KNOW HOW TO HOW TO GET BACK TO US [inaudible] AS LEGISLATORS [inaudible] OKAY. WE TRIED THIS AND AND WE LOST RIGHT. SO IS IT THE GOVERNOR THAT'S LIKE THE BACKSTOP WHICH AT THAT RELY ON THE GOVERNOR'S VETO FOR BILLS LIKE THIS SO THEY DO LIKE A LEGAL ANALYSIS WHEN THERE'S THERE'S THE PROCESS AT ALL THE BILLS GO THROUGH -- AND THE VARIOUS COMMITTEE PROCESS -- BUT THE CLAIMS BILL I THINK IS A POLICY WHERE YOU WOULD SEE IT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS -- AND AND SOMEBODY PAYING ATTENTION TO THE CLAIMS BILL -- AND DOING THE ANALYSIS COULD TRACK HOW MANY OF THESE CASES THERE ARE FROM YEAR TO YEAR SO THAT'S THE TYPICAL PROCESS MOST OF THESE GO THROUGH. I I WILL MOVE THE ITEM MANAGER THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME TRY. TO PEEL THE ONION A LITTLE BIT CERTAINLY. I'VE IRONICALLY WE EN WHAT WE'VE? SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH ARE ITEMS THAT. WERE COMPELLED TO HAVE TO MAKE THE EXPENDITURE DUE TO A COURT ACTION BUT IT'S NOT SO MUCH FROM A BILL. THAT WAS BECAUSE TO BE pINTERVENING WHERE THEY FELT THAT WE DID NOT ACT. YET APPROPRIATELY SO WHEN WE LOOK AT WHEN THE RECEIVER IS HERE. ALL OF THE INCREASED COST. NOT ALL BUT MOST FROM FROM. AT THAT HE BRINGS TO US WHICH HAVE BEEN QUITE SIGNIFICAN LAST FEW YEARS [inaudible] CORD ACTION. NOW WE JUST GOT ONE AGAIN -- WITH -- GETTING A SETTLEMENT FOR MORTGAGE. FINE SO I JUST GOT. YEAH. JUST DECIDED SO THERE'S PROBABLY MORE LAWYER FEES THAT WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. AND SOME OF THOSE -- SETTLEMENTS ARE REIMBURSING -- VARIOUS LAWYERS SO THERE'S NOT AN ASK FOR MORE MONEY BUT THERE'S A SETTLEMENT PROCESS THAT'S REIMBURSING -- THE COST OF THOSE ATTORNEYS. RESTAURANT THANK YOU. WE'VE GOT A MOTION -- IN ITS THE TO APPROVE AS PROPOSED AND WILL DO A ROLL CALL. CENTER SKINNER HI CENTER MORE LAKAI SENATOR BELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO NOW WE WILL AND THAT BY. THE WILL TO THAT'S THE END OF OUR DOJ ISSUES -- PUBLIC COMMENT ON THAT ITEM. ALRIGHT WILL NOW MOVE TO OUR DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. IT'S ITEM. FIVE TWO TWO FIVE ISSUE TWENTY SEVEN AND IT'S IN -- INFIRM IT'S MOSTLY INFORMATION ALTHOUGH IT DOES SUGGEST OUR EXPENDITURES. BASED ON THE POPULATION ADJUSTMENT SO. MISTER SWANSON MAISIE PERCY ALL RIGHT. AGAIN AMERICA SWANSON W. DIRECTOR CCAR'S OFFICE OF FISCAL SERVICES -- CDC ARE UPDATES OUR POPULATION ESTIMATES TWICE PER YEAR. ON JANUARY TEN ENEMY REVISION -- IT'S ALL INCLUDED WE HAVE IT'S A WE DO A BUNCH OF POPULATION JUDGMENTS ARE ALL IN THIS SORT OF BINDER WE DISTRIBUTE. TO LA -- WITH ALLEGE STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS -- BUT THERE ARE THREE POPULATION BASE PROPOSALS THAT YOU'VE NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA. BUT DEPARTMENTS REQUESTED HE HAS COMPARED TO THE JANUARY BUDGET. AROUND A SEVENTY SEVENTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION ARNOLD INSTITUTIONS. IN EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR INCREASED OUR CUSTODY TO COMMUNITY TRANSITIONAL REENTRY PROGRAMS. AND A SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE FOR JUVENILE FACILITIES -- HI BEFORE WE I WANT TO GET -- TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK OF THE LA -- BECAUSE THE FIGURES THAT I'VE. SAID TO YOU RIGHT NOW ARE GOING TO BE ADJUSTED BASED ON SOME OF THE FINDINGS OF THE LA ALWAYS MADE AND WE AGREE WITH -- WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF GOING THROUGH THAT -- ESTIMATE RIGHT NOW BUT I DO WANT TO INTRODUCE TO YOU -- CHRIS CHAMBERS TO SEE SOCIAL DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH AND HE'S GOING TO TALK TO A LITTLE BIT ABOUT GENERAL POPULATION TRENDS BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THAT -- TO BEFORE WE HEAR FROM YOU. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE INDICATING NOW OUR RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD THIS ITM OPEN AND I THINK WHAT YOU ARE INDICATING IS THATYOU WOULD AGREE WITH THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE GOING TO ALREADY. A CHEST THESE NUMBERS BASED ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THE LA -- RACED BAGS THAT'S RIGHT ALRIGHT SO WE WILL HEAR FROM LA -- JUST SO ALL MY COLLEAGUES CAN. IT'S IN THE ANALYSIS BUT JUST IN CASE -- SO THAT WAY HOPEFULLY WHEN THE ITEM COMES BACK GIVEN OR TRUNCATED TIME PERIOD. WE'D BE ABLE TO ACT. I'M PRETTY. QUICKLY BUT WILL. PROCEED WITH THIS DISCUSSION AND LEARN ABOUT WHAT WAYS THEME MIGHT BE ADJUSTED. GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SENATORS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. PRODUCES POPULATION PROJECTIONS. OVER THE YEARS THE DEPARTMENT HAS FOUND THAT FUTURE INSTITUTION. FUTURE INSTITUTION POPULATION A SHAKE MOSTLY BY COURT COMMITMENTS. HOW MANY THE SENTENCE TYPE WHETHER DIED DETERMINAR LIFE SENTENCE? UNLIKE THE STAY. ADDITIONALLY OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING STATUTORY REVISIONS BALLOT INITIATIVES. IN POLICY CHANGES HAVE IMPACT. TV STARS MOST CURRENT PROJECTIONS ARE PUBLISHED. IN THE SPRING TWENTY NINETEEN POPULATION PROJECTIONS REPORT. THIS REPORT WAS RELEASED I BELIEVE ABOUT A WEEK AGO. IN THIS REPORT -- WE INCLUDE TWO SETS O ADULT PROJECTION DISPLAYS OR MORE TRADITIONAL IN MEN ARE AN ADDITIONAL DISPLAY -- THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKED BY BY DEMAND THAT SHOW SEVERAL POLICY CHANGES RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED BY THE DEPARTMENT. THOSE POLICY CHANGES INCLUDE. SUPPLEMENTAL REFORMS TO CREDIT EARNINGS INCLUDING -- INCREASES TO REHABILITATE OF ACHIEVEMENT IN EDUCATIONAL MERITS CREDITS. IN CHANGE TO NINE PER SIXTY DAY RELEASE RESTRICTION. PEARL DETERMINATION PROCESS FOR INDETERMINATE LEE SENTENCED NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS. AS WELL AS PENAL CODE SECTION ELEVEN SEVENTY D. RECALL IN RECENT AND TING CHANGES. OVERALL. THESE CHANGES ARE EXPECTED TO DECREASE INSTITUTION POPULATION AND INCREASE THE PAROLE POPULATION. OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FEW YEARS. LOOKING AT WHERE WE ARE NOW THE DAHLE INSTITUTION POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO DECREASE OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. WE ARE PROJECTING CLOSING THIS FISCAL YEAR OUT WITH A AN ADULT POPULATION OF A HUNDRED TWENTY SIX SIX NINETY GIVEN WHERE WERE AT I THINK WERE JUST A FEW HUNDRED OFFICE NUMBER RIGHT NOW SO WE ARE ON TRACK WITH THIS. WE PROJECT OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT TWO FISCAL YEARS OUR POPULATION TO DECREASE ROUGHLY BY ABOUT A TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED ABOUT 2% OVERALL. LOOKING A PAROLE POPULATION PRO POPULATION IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE THIS FISCAL YEAR OUT AT FORTY NINE FOUR OH THREE IN INCREASE OVERALL DURING THE SPAN OF THE NEXT TWO FISCAL YEARS BY ABOUT NINE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PAROLEES. OR ONE POINT. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY MY BRIEF SUMMARY. IT WILL BE FOR WE HEAR FROM LA -- I JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS ON THE COMMUNITY -- THE CUSTODY TO COMMUNITY TRANSITIONAL REENTRY WHICH I DON'T THINK IS THE SUBJECT OF MOST OF YOUR COMMENTS AROUND JUSTICE POPULATION CALCULATION ARE YOU DID HAVE SOMEONE THAT -- PART ONE TO PROCEED IN AN OFFICE MY QUESTIONS DO YOU LIKE ME AT CAITLYN O'NEILL WITH THE LA -- WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO GIVE OUR COMMENTS ON THE WHOLE THING OKAY -- SO REGARDING THE A DAHLE INMATE POPULATION AT AS WAS INDICATED THE DEPARTMENT PRODUCED TWO SETS OF PROJECTIONS FOR THE ADULT AND MADE POPULATION THIS MAY ONE IS. A DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT JUST BASED ON HAVING MORE ACTUAL DATA SINCE THAT -- JANUARY PROJECTIONS WERE RELEASED THE SECOND ADDRESS FURTHER DOWNWARD BASED ON THE ANTICIPATED EFFECT OF THE POLICY CHANGES THAT WERE LISTED -- THE BUDGET ADJUSTMENT WAS BASED AS AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND -- ACCIDENTALLY OFF OF THE FIRST SET OF PROJECTION SET SO -- THE DEPARTMENT IS WORKING TO UPDATE THAT BUDGET ADJUSTMENT TO INCLUDE THE ADDITIONAL DECLINE THAT'S PROJECTED AS A AS A RESULT OF THIS THE POLICY CHANGES. AND SO WE WILL CERTAINLY REVIEW THAT BUDGET ADJUSTMENT AND COMMUNICATE ANY CONCERNS WE IDENTIFY TO THE COMMITTEE. EN WHAT YOU WHAT YOU'RE INDICATING IS THAT IN OTHER WORDS THEY I AM. WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US IS A POPULATION ADJUSTMENT BASED ON? IT FIGURES. AND IT DOES NOT INCORPORATE THE THE COURT ACTION IN A COUPLE OF OTHER ACTIONS THAT WOULD. UNDER PROP FIFTY SEVEN AND A FEW OTHER THINGS POTENTIALLY HAVE FOLKS WITH EARNING CREDITS BE ABLE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE. POTENTIALLY SOONER WHICH MAY FURTHER REDUCE THE POPULATION THAT CRACKED OKAY. AND SO WE'RE GONNA. IN ONE ITEM COMES BACK WE'LL GET ADJUSTED NUMBERS. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY AND ONE OTHER RECOMMENDATION THAT IS NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA ON THIS NOTE ON THIS TOPIC IS -- WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED STATUTE REQUIRING THE DEPARTMENT TO NOTIFY THE LEGISLATURE AND PROVIDE. A POPULATION IMPACT ESTIMATES WHEN IT MAKES FURTHER CHANGES TO ITS CREDIT EARNING REGULATIONS AS CHANGES TO CREDIT EARNING CAN HAVE AS WE SAW IN THIS CASE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE POPULATION WHICH IS. IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE AS IT CONSIDERS CCAR'S RESOURCE NEEDS AND OTHER RELATED -- POLICY ISSUES [inaudible] OKAY. AND THEN YOU HAD AS A THING ON A CUSTODY TO COMMUNITY TRANSITIONAL REENTRY YES. SO WE WE BELIEVE THAT THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE EVALUATED FOR COST EFFECTIVENESS BEFORE IT IS EXPANDED. AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO YOUR P. ARE THE EXPANSION OF C. C. T. R. P. ACCORDING TO THE COST ESTIMATES AND THE PROPOSAL WOULD BE FIVE TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE DâN -- ON A ON A PER INMATE BASIS DAN WHERE THESE WOMEN WOULD BE HOUSED UNDER THE STATUS QUO. THIS MEANS THAT CC TO YOUR P. WOULD NEED TO BE ESSENTIALLY MORE THAN FIVE TIMES AS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING RECIDIVIST RECIDIVISM RECRUITING OTHER BENEFITS. AS A STANDARD PRISON ENVIRONMENT. HOWEVER THERE SIMPLY ISN'T -- WE A SIMPLY DON'T KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE THE CC TEAR P. PROGRAM IS GIVEN THAT HASN'T BEEN EVALUATED. THE DEPARTMENT HAS PROVIDED SOME DATA INDICATING THAT WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATE IN CC TEAR P. ARE LESS LIKELY TO RESET OF EIGHT THAN WOMEN WHO DON'T PARTICIPATE IN CC TEAR HE HOWEVER THAT ISN'T REALLY AN APPLES TO APPLES COMPARISON -- BECAUSE IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER IT'S THE PROGRAM THAT'S RESULTING IN THEM BEING LESS LIKELY TO RESET OF EIGHT OR IF IT'S SUB SOMETHING TO DO WITH HOW THE WOMEN ARE SELECTED INTO THE PROGRAM IN OTHER WORDS THAT THE PROGRAM IS SORT OF NATURALLY SELECTING -- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LESS LIKELY TO RESET DEBATE TO BEGIN WITH. AND THIS IS THE KIND OF THING THAT RESEARCHERS WOULD POTENTIALLY BE ABLE TO TEASE OUT IN OTHER WORDS -- BY HAVING RESEARCHERS LOOK AT THIS PROGRAM THEY COULD POTENTIALLY COME UP WITH A CREDIBLE -- ESTIMATE ESSENTIALLY OF HOW EFFECTIVE THE PROGRAM IS. WHICH WOULD -- BE VERY VALUABLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE HAVE AS IT CONSIDERS POTENTIAL EXPANSIONS -- SO WE DO RECOMMEND THAT WHETHER OR NOT YOU APPROVED THIS EXPANSION THAT YOU REQUIRE AN INDEPENDENT STUDY OF THE PROGRAM'S COST EFFECTIVENESS -- BECAUSE HAVING THIS INFORMATION WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE -- TO ASSESS WHETHER AND CONTINUING TO INVEST IN THIS PROGRAM -- IS ALLOWING IT TO ESSENTIALLY PREVENT -- MORE VICTIMS OR REGENERATE OTHER BENEFITS DâN CHOOSING TO INVESTORS RECESS RESOURCES ELSEWHERE [inaudible] OKAY. SO MY QUESTIONS. RIGHT NOW. THE I SEE COMMUNITY TRANSITION RAINTREE PROGRAM. HAS LOCATIONS IN SAN DIEGO SANTA FE SPRINGS SPEAKERS FILL STOCKTON IN SACRAMENTO. EN ROUTE WE HAVE IN OUR REPORT THE NUMBER OF BEDS. ARE THOSE FULL RIGHT NOW ARE THOSE FLOOR THE BEDS FULL -- LET ME CALL UP AMY MILLER WHOSE -- ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF OUR DIVISION OF ADULT INSTITUTIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AMY MILLER. AND THOSE BEDS ARE FULL SO WE HAVE. SO THERE'S A NATURAL -- TURNOVER SO AS A AND D. WERE FILLING BEHIND THEM WE DO CURRENTLY HAVE A WAIT LIST OF APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED WOMEN WAITING TO GET INTO THOSE PROGRAMS THEY'RE ALL VOLUNTARY SO THE WOMEN ACTUALLY. A VOLUNTEER FOR THE PROGRAM AND THEN THEY ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SELECT WHICH FACILITY THEY'D LIKE TO GO -- TO SO SOME OF THEM CHOOSE TO BE CLOSER TO HOME CLOSER TO FAMILIES OTHERS LOOKING FOR A FRESH START. BUT AS OF RIGHT NOW THAT WAIT LIST WE HAVE WAIT LISTS FOR EVERY SINGLE FACILITY AND THEY ARE BEING KEPT FULL SO AS WOMEN EXIT. DATE THEN ARE ARE BEING PLACED ON WITHIN A WEEK OR SO WERE FILLING THOSE BETS BEHIND THEM. ARE THESE -- TRANSITIONAL FACILITIES. IT UP IN A WAY THAT. THE STATE COULD POTENTIALLY. CHARGE MEDI CAL [inaudible] I'M. IT RECOVER COSTS. FOR THESE FOLKS THAT WE MIGHT RECOVER IF THEY WERE IN. YOU KNOW THAT WE CANNOT RECOVER. IF WE HOLD THEM IN OUR STATE FACILITY OUR STATE PRISON FACILITY SO WE ACTUALLY HOPE TO THAT THAT WOULD BE THE CASE AND WHEN THOSE -- PROGRAMS WERE INITIALLY BROUGHT ONLINE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN AND AS WE'VE EXPANDED -- WE BELIEVE THAT THEY DID MEET THE CRITERIA HOWEVER WE HAD SOME EXTENSIVE MEETINGS OVER ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS TO TWO YEARS WITH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AT WHICH TIME THEY ULTIMATELY DECIDED THAT ARE WOMEN DID NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY BECAUSE THEY WERE TECHNICALLY STILL INMATES. NOT RELEASED ON PAROLE AND THAT THEY COULD BE RETURNED INTO THE STATE PRISONS AT ANY TIME -- AS THE POLICY WORKS SO LIKE I SAID WE SPENT A COUPLE OF YEARS TRYING TO GET THOSE WOMEN APPROVED FOR MEDI CAL ULTIMATELY. THAT THAT WAS DISAPPROVED SO CURRENTLY WE WORK WITH OUR HEALTH CARE SERVICES VERY CLOSELY THEY'VE WE'VE WORKED WITH -- CLINICS IN THE AREA AND WE WORK THROUGH HEALTH NET TO GET THEM SERVICES SO THERE'S NO IMPACT ACCESS TO CARE IT'S SO WHEN WE FIRST APPROVED THIS IT WAS ANTICIPATED THAT THE COST MIGHT BE LESS. TO THE STATE FOR THEIR FOR HOLDING THEM. OR FOR THEIR BEING IN THESE TRANSITIONAL FACILITIES VERSUS BEING HELD. IN OUR CORRECTIONS FACILITY THAT'S CORRECT THAT WAS THE ASSUMPTION AT THE TOP RIGHT NOW THE COST PER INMATE IS HIGHER. SO THE MEDICAL EXPENSES -- OBVIOUSLY ARE BILLED SEPARATELY AND SO THOSE GO THROUGH THE HEALTH NET CONTRACT. SO ABSOLUTELY THEY'RE NOT BEING COVERED UNDER MEDICARE ALL THOSE ARE EXPENSES THAT THAT ARE BEING PAID FOR IT IS THE COST JUST TO HAVE THEM IN THE RE ENTRY FACILITY HIGHER PER PERSON. THAN IF THEY WERE IN THE ACT CORRECTIONAL FACILITY THEY HAD BEEN IN PREVIOUSLY I DON'T KNOW I DON'T THINK SO A LOT OF TIMES IS THIS POPULATION IS TENDS TO BE HEALTHIER -- THAN THE POPULATION WE HAVE IN OUR PRISONS THAT'S ONE OF THE YOU KNOW I'M NOT JUST DOING ITS HEALTHCARE COSTS NO MY QUESTION A LITTLE OVERALL COSTS CORRECT. YET WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT IT'S MORE EXPENSIVE TO HOUSE THEM THERE WE BELIEVE THAT -- IT'S IT'S PROBABLY A COMPARABLE OR EVEN A LITTLE BIT LESS AND THEN ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT WE DO HAVE A A FAIRLY LOW RECIDIVISM NUMBER. THAT IS COMING OUT OF THAT PROGRAM SO FAR AND SO WE RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF OF THEIR RELEASE AND NOT COMING BACK INTO PRISON IS A HUGE VALUE FOR US AS WELL ALEJO'S COMMENTS SEEM TO INDICATE THAT THE COST. OUT THE REENTRY FACILITY IS HIGHER PER PERSON THAN THE COST AT THE THE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY THE WOMAN HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN AT AND YOU INDICATE NO. THEY'RE NODDING THEIR HEADS YES. CAN WE HAVE SOME CLARIFICATION. ADD THAT WE USE THE NUMBERS THAT ARE PROVIDED IN THE PROPOSAL WHICH I UNDERSTAND THAT THE FINAL CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY COULD CHANGE -- BUT IF YOU SIMPLY TAKE THE THE TOTAL DOLLAR QUESTION DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE HOUSE THERE YOU GET ABOUT. SIXTY THOUSAND PER YEAR AND OTHERWISE THESE WOMEN AS FAR AS WE UNDERSTAND WOULD BE HOUSED IN THE STATE PRISON WHICH COSTS ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND PER YEAR PER INMATE. JUST WHAT WE THIS IS THE COST TO ADD OR REMOVE ONE IN MAINE IS TWELVE THOUSAND BECAUSE YOU ONLY HAVE TO PAY OR WE ONLY HAVE TO PAY FOR FOOD CLOTHES. ETCETERA WE DON'T CUT CITY STAFFING YOU ONLY SEE THOSE SAVINGS AND OTHER TYPES OF STAFFING. YOU WOULD ONLY SEE THOSE IF WE WERE CLOSING A WHOLE PRESENT THAT'S WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE EIGHTY THOUSAND NUMBER THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY MORE FAMILIAR WITH THAT'S THE AVERAGE COST OF A INMATE. PER YEAR IN THE STATE PRISON SO BY MOVING THAT'S HUNDRED TWENTY WOMEN OUT OF THE STATE PRISON. WE WOULDN'T BE CLOSING A STATE FACILITY SO WE WOULDN'T SEE ANY OVERHEAD COSTS GO WAY WHICH IS. WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT STAFFING LARGELY -- SO WE WOULD BE SAVING ON THINGS LIKE FOOD AND CLOTHING AND OTHER WHAT WE CALL MARGINAL COSTS. NON OVERHEAD ESSENTIALLY AND THAT'S ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND PER YEAR. ALTHOUGH COUL BE LESS OF THESE WOMEN PARTICULAR WOMEN ARE LESS COSTLY. THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY GERMANE TO THIS DISCUSSION BUT IN EFFECT WHAT YOU'RE ADVOCATING IS THAT ANY POPULATION REDUCTION IS NOT. A SAVING THIS MONEY. REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE COST IS IN ANOTHER FACILITY SO ANY POPULATION REDUCTION IN THE STATE PRISON IS NOT SAVE US MONEY. THIS ISN'T A POP A REDUCTION OF THE OVERALL INMATE POPULATION IT SHOULD IT IS IN A FACILITY CORRECT BUT SO IT'S REDUCING THE NUMBER OF INMATES IN STATE PRISONS AND EACH ONE OF THOSE COMES OUT AT AN ANNUAL COST OF ABOUT. TWELVE THOUSAND BUT THEN WE'RE MOVING THEM INTO A MORE COSTLY FACILITY BY THE YES BY THAT SOME SINS IN THE B. C. P. ABOUT -- SIXTY THOUSAND PER YEAR SO IT'S NOT. IT'S SIXTY THOUSAND TOTAL PER PERSON PER YEAR COMPARED TO IN THE STATE FACILITY WHICH IS EIGHTY THOUSAND PER PERSON PER YEAR BUT IN A IN THE CASE OF ACTIVATING TUNE TO NEW FACILITIES WITH. THE DECISION THERE IS. IS TO ACTIVATE THE WHOLE FACILITY AND WENT WITH A SMALL FACILITY LIKE. SIXTY BEDS EACH YOU'RE STILL. YOU'RE YOU'RE OPERATING THE WHOLE FACILITY ESSENTIALLY HOW MAY HOWEVER MANY PEOPLE YOU% CHOOSE TO PUT THERE. SO. IT'S ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE PAYING THE AVERAGE CAUGHT THE FULL -- SIXTY THOUSAND TO ACTIVATE THE NEW FACILITY WERE IS ON A ON THE FLIP SIDE WHEN WE'RE BRINGING DOWN THE PRISON POPULATION WE'RE NOT. AS AS A RESULT OF THIS EXPANSION GOING TO CLOSE A PRISON SO WHEN YOU'RE IN THE ACTIVE ON THE ACTIVATION SIDE YOU'RE INCURRING. FIXED COSTS ON THE ON THE DECLINE TO THE PRISON POPULATION YOU'RE NOT. SAVING FIXED COSTS OVERHEAD COSTS I SHOULD SAY THAT MAKE MAKES SENSE. SO IT. ANOTHER WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT IS THE EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EXAMPLE INCLUDES A LOT OF CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS AND THEIR SALARY AND THE NUMBER OF CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS THAT ARE EMPLOYED BY CDC OURS AND CAN BE CHANGED BECAUSE WE TAKE THESE A HUNDRED TWENTY WOMEN OUT. AND SO YOU'RE NOT REALLY GONNA CHANGE NUMBER CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS UNLESS YOU'RE MAKING A LARGE ADJUSTMENTS LIKE ENOUGH TO SHUT DOWN ENTIRE WING OF A PRISONER OR PRISONER OVERALL. BUT IT DOES DEAL WITH OUR OUR WOMEN'S FACILITY STILL ARE. HI MORE OVERCROWDED DETERMINES FACILITIES. WHILE WE WHILE OUR COURT ORDER NUMBERS IN IT IS A TOTAL NUMBER. WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR INDIVIDUAL FACILITIES THE ONE SPECIFIC CITIES ARE HAVE HAD LESS REDUCTION IN OUR MORE CROWDED? THAN -- OUR MEN'S FACILITY SO. WHILE IT MAY NOT REDUCE COSTS IT DOES ADDRESS THAT ISUE OF THE OVERCROWDING WHICH WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT. TO AHEAD I HAVE THE OVERCROWDING FIGURES IF YOU'D LIKE -- BUT BY A FACILITY VERSES OVERALL OKAY. SO THE OVERALL NUMBER IS A HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN POINT OF WHAT WE HAVE. CAVALIERS -- AS OF MAY EIGHTH ONE OF OUR WOMEN'S FACILITIES WAS AT A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO POINT 5% -- ONE WAS AT A HUNDRED TWENTY SIX POINT. THREE AND ANOTHER WITH THAT HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN POINT. NINE THE ORDERLY ONE IS A VOTER TWO POINT FIVE ONE TWENTY SIX AND ONE SIXTEEN SIXTEEN OKAY SO ONE ONE OVER ON AVERAGE -- THE FEMALE THE WOMEN'S IN FEMALE INSTITUTIONS OVERALL IS AT ONE THIRTY THREE POINT. NINE AND THE MEN WERE AT ONE THIRTY ONE POINT THREE ON AVERAGE ACROSS ALTHOUGH MANY SOME OF THE MEN'S PRISONS ARE FAR MORE IN FAR LESS CROWDED. BERMAN FINANCE YOU WANTED TO ADD -- AYE MADELINE CLAIM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I THINK. WHILE IDEALLY IT WAS CORRECTED IF YOU TRULY THAT IF YOU PULL THE NUMBER SPECIFICALLY FOR THE C. C. TRP PROPOSAL AND DIVIDE IT BY THE HUNDRED TWENTY PARTICIPANTS YOU DO GET THAT COST OF SIXTY THOUSAND BUT IF YOU AVERAGE. THE COST OF THE ENTIRE C. C. T. R. P. PROGRAM IT'S ROUGHLY EIGHTY TWO DOLLARS PER DAY -- PER -- OFFENDER WHICH IS ROUGHLY THIRTY THOUSAND PER YEAR SO AS A AS A WHOLE FOR THE PROGRAM IT IS LESS BUT I DO UNDERSTAND BE ALEJO'S POINT I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT. IN TOTAL THE THE OVERALL PROGRAM SAVINGS ARE LESS. COSTS ARE LESS. VERY I WANNA RETURN -- TO TO THE MEDI CAL QUESTION -- SO YOU INDICATED THAT. WE THAT WHEN WE FIRST BROUGHT IT ONLINE WE ARE HOPING THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE -- TO RECOVER COSTS THROUGH MEDICARE ALL USED UTILIZING THIS TYPE OF REENTRY FACILITY BUT THEN YOU DESCRIBE THAT IN INTERACTIONS WITH THEIR OWN DEPARTMENT. THAT WAS DETERMINE WE COULD NOT WERE THERE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE FEDS. SO THOSE DISCOVERY IN OTHER WORDS WE OURSELVES PREVENT OUR ABILITY -- TO POTENTIALLY RECOUP THE COSTS. YES FOR YES IT DOES SO THERE IS -- THERE'S A DOCUMENT THAT CAME FROM THE FEDS THAT TO FIND -- WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FOR MEDI CAL FNDING AND USING THAT DOCUMENT THAT CAME FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT WAS OUR? AND OURSELVES OUR DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT ULTIMATELY USE THAT DEFINITION INDETERMINATE THAT OUR PARTICIPANTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE. YES MA'AM. I THINK WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT TO REVISIT THAT AND TO SEE WHAT ADJUSTMENTS THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE. IN THE FACILITY THEY MAY NOT BE ACCEPTABLE BUT TO SEE WHAT ADJUSTMENTS WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE OR WHETHER THERE'S ANY WAIVERS. BECAUSE THE PREMISE WHEN WE APPROVED THIS WAS THAT PREMISE AND HI. I WOULD HOPE THAT WE WOULD HAVE. MORE THOROUGHLY. WE WOULD HAVE EXHAUSTED OUR POSSIBILITIES VERSUS JUST DETERMINING BASED ON F. DEFINITION ON A PIECE OF PAPER -- QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS FROM COMMENTS I MEAN COLLEAGUES. I JUST HAD SOMEONE ON THE ELIGIBILITY -- SO WE HAVE WE HAVE LIKE -- THE COURTESY THE COMMUNITY TRANSITIONAL REENTRY PROGRAM THE ONE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW THEN WE HAVE -- THE FEMALE OFFENDER. EMINEM PLYMOUTH PROGRAM. ACT THAT'S NOTELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAL EITHER RIGHT. SO THE THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS ACTUALLY A PAROLES BASED PROGRAM THE ONE IT'S BASED IT'S IT'S UP PAROLE PROGRAMS OF THOSE WOMEN ARE RELEASED FROM. STATE PRISON AND SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THEY ARE ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL DOT POINTS THEN THERE IS A MALE COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAM. THE ELIGIBLE. IT'S IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS C. C. T. R. P. SO TO SAY IT'S A NOT ELIGIBLE -- THEN -- ENHANCE ALTERNATIVE BECAUSE THE PROGRAM. SO THAT'S THAT'S OUR SIXTY TRP PROGRAM SIR THAT'S THE SAME THING AS A CC OR DARK CUSTODY TO COMMUNITY TRANCE SO -- SO WHERE THESE PROGRAMS -- HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN ESTABLISHED -- IN -- IN THE STATE BUDGET. SO THE CUSTODY TO COMMUNITY TRANSIT TRANSITIONAL REENTRY PROGRAMS BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN THE MALE COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAMS CAME ONLINE YEARS EARLIER MAYBE. WRITTEN RIGHT APARTMENT A FINANCE THAT CUT TO THE CITY TEAR PEAS THE WOMEN'S PROGRAMS WITH TWENTY THIRTEEN AND M. C. R. P. WAS. TWENTY FIFTEEN OKAY -- WAS -- WHAT WAS A PROGRAM OF THE CENTER LOSE STARTED? FOR WOMEN'S REENTRY PROGRAM SHE'S CHAIR PROGRAM. WAS A PROGRAM. THAT WAS THE ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY PROGRAM THIS CALL THEIR FOR I'M JUST GETTING ALL THE NAMES AND I WON OKAY TELL ME ABOUT WHEN WAS THAT ESTABLISHED. IS HOME. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT AND THIS AND OTHER PEOPLE IN THAT PROGRAM SO I BELIEVE THAT WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT ALL THESE PROGRAS. THAT'S ONE I BELIEVE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED AROUND I'D WANT TO SAY AROUND TWENTY ELEVEN AND TWENTY TEN JONES SOMETIME IN THAT -- IS AN AUTHOR THAT PROPOSAL AND BY THE DEPARTMENT MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO IT MORE -- THAN THAN I IN GREATER DETAIL BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY PROGRAM TYPICALLY WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING WITH THESE WOMEN -- AND NOW IT'S AVAILABLE TO MEN AS WELL IF I'M CORRECT -- THEY ARE ABLE TO STAY IN THE COMMUNITY TYPICALLY IT'S WITH FAMILY MEMBERS THAT THEY'LL STAY. AS OPPOSED TO BEING IN A FACILITY WOULD LIKE TO SEE C. TRP SO THAT IS THAT'S THE MAIN DIFFERENCE DOES THAT PROGRAM ELIGIBLE -- FOR MEDI CAL. REIMBURSE YES YES THOSE MEN AND WOMEN IN THE ALTERNATIVE CUTS THE PROGRAM ARE ELIGIBLE. SO SO IF WE HAVE THAT PROGRAM IS ELIGIBLE IN THIS ONE ISN'T. OF HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN THE ONES HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE ONE THAT. OF HIS OLD ONE FOR THE MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT. SEVEN THAT ARE ASKING FOR MORE MONEY FOR THIS. ONE KIND OF WONDERING WHY YOU'RE NOT ASKING FOR MORE MONEY FOR THE OTHER. ONE SO THE ALTERNATIVE CUTS THE PROGRAM THOSE THOSE OFFENDERS ARE ACTUALLY RELEASED OUT INTO EITHER A PRIVATE RESIDENCE OR INTO A PROGRAM -- AND AND SO WE NO LONGER HAVE ANY OVERSIGHT -- ASIDE FROM PAROLES AND ARE TYPICAL -- INTERACTIONS WITH THEM ON A PAROLE BASIS AND THAT'S WHY THESE CUSTODY TO COMMUNITY TRANSITIONAL RIO BRANCHER PROGRAMS THESE ARE OUR RUN. WITH BY US WE MONITOR THEM WE HAVE PAROLE AGENTS AT THE FACILITY AS WELL AS COUNSELORS AT THE FACILITY AND THEN WE HAVE -- TYPICALLY AT A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT RUNS THE RE AND HAVE BILL TATIAN PROGRAMS AND SUCH I UNDERSTAND HOW MANY HOW MANY -- PEOPLE ARE IN THE OTHER PROGRAM ON THE OTHER PROGRAM WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY FORTY WOMEN IN THE ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY PROGRAM AND THEN FOR THE MEN. WE WE ARE NORMALLY BETWEEN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY IS THAT ONE FULL. CAPACITIES AT THE THERE'S NO BAD NUMBERS THERE SO THAT REALLY IS AS MANY AS QUALIFY WE COULD PUT OUT THERE INTO THOSE PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY GO OUT EITHER TO A FAMILY MEMBER OR A SPOUSE PARENT. OR INTO A PRIVATE PROGRAM THAT THEY ACTUALLY -- FINE IS THAT THE PROGRAM WHERE THESE THEY GET SENT TO A A RE ENTRY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. AND THEY CAN LIVE WITH THEIR CHILDREN. SO THAT'S A ACTUALLY A SEPARATE PROGRAM THOSE A I'M TRYING TO GET ALL THESE THINGS STRAIGHT SETS  COMMUNITY PRISONER MOTHER PROGRAM THAT'S A TWENTY FOUR BED WAS ONES WHAT'S IT CALLED THE COMMUNITY PRISONER MOTHER PROGRAM IT'S IN POMONA CALIFORNIA. TO TWENTY FOUR BED FACILITY RIGHT SO IS THERE PROGRAM -- LOS WERE -- EXPANSION IS THAT -- THOSE PROGRAMS ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL. THE OF THE WOMEN IN THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM ACTUALLY GO BACK TO THE INSTITUTION FOR MEDICAL SERVICES THE CHILDREN ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE ALL IN THEIR TREATMENT IS PROVIDED THAT WAY -- AND SO WE ARE CURRENTLY AT TWENTY TWO WOMEN IN THAT PARTICULAR PROGRAM -- THE NUMBERS THAT ARE ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE FOR THAT ARE FAIRLY LOW -- BASED ON ON THE FACT THAT THEY CAN'T HAVE ANY CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN AND I KNOW ENDANGERMENT TYPE OF OF ISSUES AND SO. WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A VERY LARGE PIPELINE FOR THAT PARTICULAR FACILITY. RISEN ASKING THIS IS YOU'RE YOU'RE ASKING. FOR THE EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION -- IN THE GENERAL FUND FOR THIS PROGRAM. WHICH WE CAN GET REIMBURSED FOR MEDI CAL BUT WE HAVE ALL THESE OTHER PROGRAMS. AND I KNOW THEY HAVE DIFFERENT QUALIFICATIONS DIFFERENT TYPES OF PEOPLE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW LIKE THAT BUT I I I I I I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT. WE GET THE FULL SCOPE OF ALL THE THE RE ENTRY PROGRAMS. SAID AND AND WHAT'S WHAT'S WHAT'S THEIR ACTUAL SUCCESS AND FOR THE TYPES OF PEOPLE THEY'RE SERVING AND DO THEY DO THEY MERIT -- SOME CONSIDERATION EDITION OF THIS PROGRAM ARE AS OPPOSED TO THIS PROGRAM AND SURE OF A THAT'S THAT'S WHERE I LOOKED AT THIS SO I THINK IT'S A FAIR QUESTION. BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO PROMOTE -- THESE -- SUCCESSFUL REENTRY PROGRAMS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE SO SO I LIKE TO HAVE THAT. IN A WAY MAYBE WE HAVE SO MANY AT ARE THEY MANAGED BY THE SAME PEOPLE OR HE EXPLAINED OUT HOW THE MANAGEMENT OF ALL THESE REENTRY PROGRAMS. SO IT THAT CUSTODY TO COMMUNITY TRANSITIONAL REENTRY PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY UNDER THAT FEMALE OFFENDER PROGRAMS AND SERVICES EACH OF THE PROGRAMS ON THE COMMUNITY ARE RAN BY A DIFFERENT ENTITY SO WE HAVE ON LA KATA ALLEN THE LOS ANGELES AREA WE HAVE WEST CARE. SO I ST JOHN'S HERE IN SACRAMENTO'S WITH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT HELP TO RUN THOSE PROGRAMS AND THEIR OVERSEEN BY OUR CONTRACT BED UNIT WHICH FALLS INTO MY MY MISSION. THE MALE COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAMS ARE ACTUALLY RUN BY THE DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND SO THAT A SEPARATE ENTITY FOR US OKAY -- I WOULD APPRECIATE IT THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING I'M ASKING. FOR MAYBE -- A LOOK AT ALL THOSE AND TO SEE WHICH ONES ARE. THE THE WINNERS IN TERMS OF SIX SIN. YOU KNOW WE WANT TO LOOK AT THAT WAY THANK. FEDERAL. MADAM CHAIR JUST A COUPLE BASIC QUESTIONS. IT IS A HISTORY OF PROVIDING POPULATION ADJUSTMENTS IS THIS. SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN DOING. FOR NUMBER OF YEARS YEAH I'M LIKE A OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE DRIVEN STE MORE ON CASELOAD OF LIKE OF THERE'S A LOT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE A POPULATION ADJUSTMENTS LIQUOR TWICE A YEAR -- WE HAVE A JUST CONSIDER MADE. BASED ON OUR INMATE AND KAROLI LEVELS ARE BASED ON THE STAFFING STANDARDS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT POPULATION. VOTER MANPOWER MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS. IT'S THAT AND IT'S OTHER THINGS AS WELL IF THROUGH OUR POPULATION PROCESS WE ALSO DO -- HOUSING UNIT CONVERSIONS AS WE HAVE THE POPULATION CHANGES AND SHIFTS. AND WE NEED TO SHIFT THINGS AROUND WITH OUR PRISON. AND WE HAVE BEEN A COUPLE OF NUMBERS OTHER WAY NO NUMEROUS OTHER THINGS WE D THROUGH THAT PROCESS BASED ON POPULATION. AND I'M SEEING LEASE FOR THE ADULT POPULATION THAT THERE'S SOME DECREASES. BUT BIG NUMBERS BUT THREE FORTY ONE AND TWO SIXTY SIX DO YOU DO PLAYOFFS OR YES IN FACT WILL NOT LAY OFFS WE TRY NOT. TO BUT IN THIS -- PARTICULAR BUDGET WE HAVE. WE'RE ASSUMING THAT ALL OF OUR INMATES THAT ARE EVEN OUT OF STATE FACILITIES WE CURRENTLY USED TO HAVE -- INMATES IN -- A FEW STATES WE NOW HAVE INMATES ONLY LEFT IN ARIZONA. THAT GROUP WILL BE -- GONE Y THE END OF THE YEAR AND SO WE DO HAVE. A FEW POSITIONS WITHIN THE CONTRACT AND UNIT THAT ARE COMING DOWN WITH THAT AS WELL. SO WHEN YOU HAVE AN INCREASE YOU CAN GO OUT OF STATE. AN OUT SOURCE. THAT IS CORRECT THAT OUR GOAL IS TO ELIMINATE THE USE OF THOSE OUT OF STATE BEDS RIGHT BUT IT'S A IT'S A STRATEGY WHEN YOU HAVE AN INCREASING POPULATION THEN AND SO TO A TEMPORARY SOLUTION THAT. BUT HOPEFULLY YOU'RE YOU'RE. TRYING TO KEEP EVERYTHING CLOSE BY OKAY. AND THEN SINCE YOU BEEN PUTTING A LOT OF NUMBERS. DO WE HAVE A COST PER CAPITA. FOR OUR PRISON POPULATION. MAY I RECOMMEND HER TO FINANCE -- WE DO PUBLISH A PER CAPITA DISPLAY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET EVERY YEAR WE CALCULATE -- BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS HOW MUCH IT PROXIMALLY COST TO HOUSE A PRISONER PER YEAR WE ALSO HAVE PER CAPITA FOR PAROLE -- CAN AND THAT'S DOES IT GIVE YOU PRIOR YEARS AS WELL. GRADE WERE WHEN I GET THAT JUST ON YOUR WEBSITE. SO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY SENATOR STUFF INDEED WE DO A CORRELATION WITH OTHER STATES TO BE COMPARED AND WE HAVE IN THE COMPARISON I CAN'T THINK OF WHERE IT'S PUBLISHED OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I CAN LOOK INTO THAT FOR YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU MANAGER. CERTAINLY. WHAT ABOUT TO THE -- COMMUNITY -- KASEY COMMUNITY TRANSITIONAL REENTRY SO THESE ARE NOT LOCKED FACILITIES. OR AT THE LEAST THEY'RE NOT. LOCKED IN THE SAME WAY THAT AS THE FACILITY THAT THE INMATE LEFT BECAUSE IT STATES RATE IN THE ANALYSIS THAT THESE ARE PARTICIPANTS THAT HAVE AN ELECTRONIC MONITORING DEVICE. WHICH MEANS THE LEAVE. THEY ARE IN THERE'S MONITORING OF THAT DEVICE OBVIOUSLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T VIOLATE WE HAVE POOL WE HAVE PEOPLE ON PAROLE SELECT TRONIC MONITORING DEVICES -- AND IT MENTIONS THAT A PRO AGENTS AGENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INSTALLATION AND MONITORING OF THE DEVICE. SO I GUESS I JUST REALLY FEEL THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN THOROUGH ABOUT THE PREMISE OF STARTING THIS PROGRAM WAS BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL WILL BOTH FIRST. TO HELP INCREASE SUCCESSFUL REENTRY BUT ADDITIONALLY BECAUSE WE WOULD BE ABLE. TO UTILIZE THE THE BET FEDERAL BENEFITS AND OTHERS TO COVER COSTS THAT WE OTHERWISE SINKER IF WE HOLD THEM IN OUR STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. SO IT IT'S IT WOULD BE VERY SIGNIFICANT. WHAT WE WOULD SAY THAT THESE FOUR HUNDRED WOMEN WERE -- THAT ARE CURRENTLY WITHOUT EVEN AN INCREASE JUST THE FOUR HUNDRED BEDS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE WERE AT IF IT IF THIS WERE DESIGNED IN THE WAY THAT WE HAD INTENDED WHEN WE APPROVED IN [inaudible] TWENTY FIFTEEN A SORRY METAL INGREDIENTS DESK FINANCE -- SO IT ACTUALLY HAS TO DO WITH THE IT'S CALLED THE THE MOVEMENT ISSUE AND THAT THE THE PEOPLE THAT THE WOMEN IN THESE FACILITIES AND MANY FACILITIES ACTUALLY HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE FACILITY AT NIGHT AND STAY THERE THEY HAVE -- A DESIGNATED TIMES RIGHT THERE CHECK IN AND SO IT'S THAT DESIGNATION ALSO THAT THAT ARE DESIGNING SO I GUESS WHAT I'M RAISING IS. THAT WE BOB THRICE THIS UNDER THE PRETTY CATION THAT WE WOULD HAVE A DESIGN. THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO RECOVER THOSE COSTS SO I WANT. THE WHEN WHAT COMES BACK AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE NUMBERS AND SUCH ADJUSTMENTS. OWN MAKE SURE THAT THE ITEM INCLUDES LANGUAGE. THAT -- DIRECTS THE DEPARTMENT TO LOOK AT THAT DESIGN. IT'S SORT OF ONE OF THOSE WELL WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT -- BUT WE KNOW IT'S GOT TO COME BACK BECAUSE THERE'S NUMBER ADJUSTMENTS THAT HAVE TO BE MADE. I AM SO APPRECIATE THAT WHEN IT COMES BACK. ALRIGHT SO IT'S WERE HOLDING IT OPEN NOW. AND WE'RE NOW GOING TO SEE IF THERE'S YES AND THEN PUBLIC COMMENT IF THERE IS PUBLIC COMING TO HAVE THEM. COME BACK SO. TO SOME BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT ALL THOSE TOGETHER REENTRY PROGRAMS AND WHAT THEY DO AND HOW MUCH THEY COST. IS THE BASIC. THESE ARE ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY PROGRAM YEAH RIGHT ALL THOSE FOR ME THE FOLKS THAT ARE. OUR FULLY OUT OF OUR THANK YOU YOUR ALTERNATIVE CASSIDY OKAY. THANK YOU. CERTAINLY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM. OKAY WILL NOW GO. TO THIS IS OUR LAST ITEM JUDICIAL BRANCH. ZERO TWO FIFTY ISSUE TWENTY NINE JUDGESHIPS YEP [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] THIS [inaudible] YES. THANK. YOU YOU MAY BEGIN ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRS LINED PRODUCER SOLVES FOR ASSEMBLY CERTAINLY SLOT COMPUTER WHICH BUDGET DIRECTOR FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. AND I'M HERE WITH ONLY A ROSE COULD WIN AND THE NANCY EVERHART -- WE ARE HERE -- TO EXCITEDLY -- DOWNS THE THE MAY REVISION PROPOSAL FOR TWENTY FIVE JUDGESHIPS IT WAS A PRIORITY -- FOR THE THE BRANCH IN THE CHIEF THREE ANNOUNCED EARLIER THIS YEAR OUR FIRST HEARING IT IS AGAIN THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN TWENTY RIGHT RAISING TWO THIRTY SIX AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS. ON GOING TO ALLOCATE A TWENTY FIVE OF FORTY EIGHT JUDGESHIPS ARE AUTHORIZED IN AB ONE FIFTY NINE BACK IN -- TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE COSTING IS BASED ON THE AMOUNTS THAT WERE APPROVED LAST YEAR FOR TWO RIVERSIDE JUDGESHIPS. AND THIS CONTINUES THE PROCESS THAT WAS APPROVED IN -- THE BILL AS FAR AS OUR PROCESS TO ALLOCATE -- THE JUDICIAL RESOURCES -- WE APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE BRANCH AND LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORT AND WE HAVE STAFF HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TECHNICALITIES OF THE OF THE METHODOLOGY. AND WE HAVE AGAIN AS HE EVER HEARD HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF THE CHOCOLATES IF YOU HAVE THOSE TYPES OF QUESTIONS. GO AHEAD YOU MAY PROCEED. OKAY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AGAIN I'M LEO ROSE GOOD WHEN I AM THE MANAGER OF THE OFFICE OF COURT RESEARCH AND THE OFFICE. BY IS IN CHARGE OF THE METHODOLOGY TO DETERMINE SHOULD SHIP NEEDS. AND THE PRIORITIZATION METHOD A BY WHICH WE WOULD -- INDICATE THE COURTS THAT WOULD QUALIFY FOR NEW JUDGESHIPS SO JUST VERY BRIEFLY AT THE USUAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS A RUN A BI ANNUALLY AND THE EVEN NUMBERED YEARS. IT IS BASED ON THREE DIFFERENT FACTORS A THREE YEAR AVERAGE OF FILENE'S IN CASES OF VARIOUS TYPES. WORKLOAD STANDARDS THAT MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT CASES OF DIFFERENT TYPES TAKE FOR PROCESSING. AND A PRIORITIZATION METHOD A TO DETERMINE IN WHICH ORDER THE JUDGESHIP SHOULD BE ALLOCATED. SO WE ARE RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDST OF UPDATING THE WORKLOAD STANDARDS -- WE AND THAT IS WHY I THINK THAT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE A CONCERNING THIS ITEM. INDICATES THAT WE WOULD BE MAKING ALLOCATIONS IN SEPTEMBER ONCE -- AND AFTER -- AFTER THE WORKLOAD STANDARDS ARE UPDATED. SO IN TERMS OF THE USE OF A PRIORITIZATION METHOD THIS IS CODIFIED IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE AND SIX NINE SIX ONE FOUR AND IT REFLECTS COUNCIL PRIORITIES OVER THE LAST DECADE -- WHICH INCLUDE CONSIDERING COURTS WITH THE GREATEST NEED FOR JUDGESHIPS. IMPROVING ACCESS TO COURTS A SAID THAT THE GREATEST NUMBERS OF USERS CAN BENEFIT. A KEEPING IN MIND THE AVAILABILITY OF COURT FACILITIES FOR NEW JUDGESHIPS. AND ENSURING THAT SMALL CORDS ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE A TO QUALIFY FOR JUDGESHIPS. SO SPEAKING JUST VERY QUICKLY ABOUT THE PRIORITIZATION METHOD THAT WE USE THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE HERE IN THE BRANCHES PROBABLY. A SOMETHING THAT OTHER AGENCIES HAVE TO DEAL WITH BUT IT IS A A POINT TO FIND THE NEED FOR NEW JUDGESHIPS WHEN YOU HAVE COUNTY IS A VERY DIFFERENT SIZES. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN LOS ANGELES -- IT WITH THERE ARE OVER FIVE HUNDRED JUDGESHIPS I NEED FOR LET'S JUST SAY FORTY JUDGES IS ABOUT 10% OF THEIR OVERALL BENCH SIZE. WHERE'S IN A SMALL CORD LAKE LASSEN FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS TYPICALLY. APPEAR ON THE LIST FOR JUDGESHIP NEEDS. ARE THEY ONLY NEED ONE JUDGE BUT THAT REPRESENTS 30% OF THEIR BENCH. SO OUR METHODOLOGY ACCOUNTS FOR THOSE BIG SIZE DIFFERENCES. AND IT BASICALLY USES AB METHOD THAT'S VERY SIMILAR TO HOW CONGRESS A PORTION SEATS -- IT USES A SET OF RANKINGS SCORES TO HELP. NORMALIZE THE NEED FOR JUDGESHIPS OF ALL CHORDS AND THEN IT GOES THROUGH THREE DIFFERENT ITERATIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR NUMERIC MEAN PERCENTAGE NEED. AND RELATIVE NEED. I AND SO THAT IS ALL I HAVE ON THE TECHNICAL PORTIONS OF THE A NEEDS ASSESSMENT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. BELIAU YOU READ SOME COMMENTS ON THIS GO AHEAD. I NEED TO LEAVE AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- SO WE WE DIDN'T HAVE CONCERNS OF THE PROPOSAL BUT WE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW IS TO THE EXTENT THAT. THE LEGISLATURE'S -- DESIRED GOAL IS TO EQUALIZE OR TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF JUDICIAL RESOURCES ACROSS THE STATE -- YOU DO HAVE A TABLE ON PAGE TWENTY ONE THAT SHOWS THE NEEDED THAT'S IDENTIFIED AND THAT'S JUST THE POSITIVE -- THE SAME STUDY ACTUALLY ON THE OTHER SIDE SHOWS THAT THEIR NUMBER OF COURTS THAT HAVE A SIMILAR AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL JUDGES BEYOND THEIR WORKLOAD. SO ONE THING THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER IS THAT IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING NEW POSITIONS THEY COULD CONSIDER REALLOCATING JUDGESHIPS -- FROM COURTS THAT HAVE MORE JUDGES THAN THEIR SSE TO THOSE THAT HAVE LASSEN THAT WOULD KIND OF EQUALIZE FASTER THAT'S ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT IT. OKAY. CENTER BILL WELD -- I THINK MY QUERY I A COUPLE QUESTIONS JUST -- WHAT IS WHAT IS HOW DOES THIS AFFECT US SPECIAL CHORDS? THAT ARE CREATED -- DO YOU ALLOCATE MONEY FOR SPECIAL COURTS SEPARATELY. YOU KNOW LIKE DRUG CORDS -- YOU KNOW. THE SPECIAL THE COURTS YOU KNOW THE MENTAL HEALTH COURTS ETCETERA. THEIR LITTLE MORE COSTLY YOU KNOW. SO -- WHAT IS THE POLICY ON? HOW YOU SET UP THOSE KINDS OF PORTS? ROAD TO TO THE WHEN YOU YOU SAID EIGHT X. NUMBER OF JUDGES AND HELLO WHAT IS THAT MEAN REGARDING THOSE COURTS. IT CENTER BALLOT I THINK AT THE FIRST HEARING HAD THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT METHODOLOGY AND AT PRESENT THERE IS A SPECIFIC ALLOCATION -- IT IS -- BASED ON LOCAL PRIORITIES pNANCY EVER ARE CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR LOCAL. IT IS AGAIN IT'S A MATTER OF A LOCAL NEED NOT EVERY COUNTY IN COURT NEEDS THE SAME AND COMMUNITY THE SAME TYPE OF SERVICE THEY'RE GIVEN MONEY FOR EACH [inaudible] JUDGE. BUT IF THEY WANT TO ESTABLISH SOME SEPARATE SPECIALLY TOWARDS. DO THEY HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY FOR IT SOME OTHER WAY OR OTHER THERE'S OFTENTIMES IT COSTS MORE RIGHT IT DOES AND IN IN THIS INSTANCE ARE THEY PAY FOR THE THERE ARE OTHER. THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE THEY HAVE USED THEIR RESOURCES HISTORICAL RESOURCES AND PRIOR INVESTMENTS LOCALLY TO SUPPORT THOSE ARE ARE SO -- STATE FUNDS FOR EXAMPLE THEY WERE -- INNOVATION GRANT FUNDS TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TWELVE MILLION OF WHICH WAS EARMARKED SPECIFICALLY -- FOR COLLABORATIVE COURTS AND THERE ARE TIMES SOME GRANTS EITHER LOCAL OR EVEN FROM SAY EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS RELOCATION TO ASSIST IN -- ADDRESSING RECIDIVISM SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF FUNDS -- THAT MAKE -- COURTS HAVE THAT THAT FUNDING AVAILABLE. AND IF IN IN NANCY LIKE TO DRESS HOW THEY DEAL WITH IT AND SAN BERNARDINO AND MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- THE ALLOCATION COMES TO THE COURT AND IN ONE LUMP SUM AND THEN IT'S A A LOCAL COURT PRIORITIES THAT AND SAID HOW WE WANT TO SET UP CALENDARS. SO THE THE PRICE IS THE SAME NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF COURT ROOM YOU SET UP -- WE DO RECEIVE SOME GRANTS LET'S SAVE A SUBSTANCE ABUSE GRANTS WE CAN SOMETIMES RECEIVE NATIONAL GRANTS FOR SOME OF THE COLLABORATIVE COURTS MOST OF THOSE ARE PASS THROUGHS -- THROUGH FOR COMMUNITY SERVICES -- SO THE COST OF A COURT ROOM IS GOING TO BE THE SAME WHETHER IT'S A SPECIALTY COURT OR LET'S SAY A GENERAL CIVIL COURT ROOM. ARE ARE YOU -- INCLUDING IN THIS THE COSTS OF LEGISLATION THAT WE PASSED OVER THE LAST YEAR. THE AFFECTS THE COURTS LAKE -- YOU KNOW THE THE DIVERT TRUCK CORD DIVERSION TITUS PROGRAMS OF THOSE KID OF THINGS. HOW DOES HOW DOES THE BUDGET REQUEST FOR THE JUDGES FOR IS AFFECTED THE BILL OF THE EFFECTIVELY THE FACTOR WE ARE REQUESTING A PORTION OF WHAT IT IS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IS IN NEED? AND I CAN THAT TURNED OVERLY -- TO DESCRIBE WHAT PROCESS WE'RE GOING INTO NOW WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF UPDATING EXACTLY WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF FIFTEEN ALL OF THOSE THOSE -- SO IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE JUDICIAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING UPDATED. UPDATED BY THE END OF THE SUMMER TO REFLECT THE NEW WORKLOAD THAT'S OCCURRED SINCE THE LAST TIME WE DID THE UPDATE THOSE ARE IMPORTANT TO ME AND THE INFORMED ABOUT THAT ABSOLUTELY YOU YOU'LL RECEIVE THAT REPORT -- AS A LEGISLATIVE REPORT THANK YOU SIR. CENTER MOORLACH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M JUST CURIOUS. THIS IS FIFTY NEW POSITIONS AND ARE THOSE FULLY FUNDED. THERE ARE TWENTY FIVE NEW JUDGESHIPS. SENATOR. I'M SORRY I HAD TO FIFTY IN MY HEAD. THERE WERE PREVIOUSLY FIFTY AUTHORIZED IN STATUTES TO WERE RECENTLY APPROVED IN THE IN THE PRIOR BUDGET TO GET US. TO THE FORTY EIGHT OF THE MOST RECENTLY AUTHORIZED THIS WOULD BE TWENTY FIVE OF THOSE -- REMAINING FORTY EIGHT FROM THE SECOND GROUP OF FIFTY THAT WERE AUTHORIZED IN THE JONES BILL IN. TWO THOUSAND SIX AND SO THIS THE STAFFING COMPLEMENT THE THE THE FUNDING IS THERE THERE'S A COMPLIMENT FOR INTERPRETERS AND THEN THERE'S THE JUDICIAL COMPENSATION THAT'S INCLUDED AND AND THE FUNDING. ROOMS LAST TIME MORE JUDGES WERE APPROVED LAST YEAR TO JUDGES FOR RIVERSIDE WERE PROVED AT ONE POINT. NO THAT WAS AN ACTION BY THE LEGISLATURE -- TO DO THAT THE BUDGET. OKAY NO I'M JUST TRYING. TO NUMBER AND ASKED BASIC QUESTIONS AT THE TIME AND THE TIME BEFORE THAT IN TERMS OF AUTHORIZED FUNDED JUDGESHIPS WAS WITH SB FIFTY SIX IN. TWO THOUSAND SIX THAT'S IT THAT'S IT YEAH. SO WHAT'S THE OVERALL PLAN BECAUSE RIVER OBVIOUSLY SHORT RATE IN IN IN AND YOU'RE JUST GIVING ME SEVENTEEN COUNTIES OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT SO. WELL NOT ALL COURTS HAVE NOT ALL COUNTIES HAVE NEEDS THESE F THE COURTS THAT ARE AT THIS POINT HAVE JUDICIAL NEEDS THE PLAN IS THAT WE GET THESE FIRST. TWENTY FIVE APPROVED AND THEN WE'LL WE'LL MOVE THERE WITH THE THE ADMINISTRATION A LEGISLATURE IN TERMS OF FOR FILL IN THE THE THE REMAINING NEED WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE AS I SAID AGAIN THE UPDATING THE JUDICIAL NEED AND WHAT COUNTIES WOULD BE. OF NEED AND SO THIS IS A THINKER A GREAT AND ACTUAL INVESTMENT IN THAT -- GRADING KNOWLEDGE WEN IN THE THE LARGEST INCREASES SINCE THE FIFTY THAT OCCURRED IN A YOU KNOW OVER A DECADE AGO. WOULD YOU BE ASKING FOR MORE WE ARE WE ARE PLEASED WITH THE TWENTY FIVE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INCLUDED. WE WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. SERVICE YOU HAVE GOVERNOR THAT HOPEFULLY WILL GIVE YOU SOME JUDGES INDEED [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. CERTAINLY UPDATED [inaudible] YEAH. WE DID AUTHORIZE COURSE I WAS IN LEGISLATURE THEN BUT HOPE WE WERE VERY COGNIZANT THAT WE NEEDED AT LEAST FIFTY MORE JUDGES BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WE'VE ONLY ADDED TO SO NOW WE HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO ADD. TWENTY FIVE BUT THE V. M.. ASSESSMENT OF WHERE THEY WOULD BE PUT IS STILL. WHEN -- THE STAFF JUST REFERENCE THAT THEY'RE DOING THIS UPDATE THAT THEY WILL BE FINISHED TILL SUMMER. WERE WERE SCHEDULED TO ADOPT THE BUDGET BEFORE. WE GET THAT -- SO I'M GONNA HOLD OPEN RIGHT NOW. WE MAY CLOSE AND ACT ON IT FOR THE JUNE FIFTEENTH OR WE MAY IN DISCUSSIONS FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO HAVE THAT UPDATED BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS ABILITY TO DO BUDGET ACTIONS [inaudible] I'M [inaudible] IN. AUGUST SEPTEMBER. I AM NOT NECESSARILY ADVOCATING WE DO THAT IN THIS CASE BECAUSE CLEARLY THE NEED IS OBVIOUSLY THERE. IT'S MORE THAT -- SINCE THIS UPDATE IS GOING TO BE FINISHED SOON THERE MIGHT BE THERE MAY BE. A COMPELLING REASON SO WE'LL FIND OUT WE HAVE SOME MORE TALKS WITH STAFF. SENATOR MORE LIKE AS A TEMP GOING FROM MEMORY THERE THE ROTH BILL I THOUGHT WE VOTED FOR THAT IT WAS AND VETO THEN BY GOVERNOR BROWN. I THINK ONCE THE BUDGET ACTION WAS TAKEN.

A LOWER PRIORITY SO WE HAD TROUBLE GETTING CIVIL CASES THROUGH THE SYSTEM BUT MUCH HAS CHANGED IN FAMILY LAW UNREPRESENTED LITIGANTS A GREAT MANY STRUCTURAL CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED IN THE COURTS.
