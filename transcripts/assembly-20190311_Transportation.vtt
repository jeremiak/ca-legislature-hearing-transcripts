00:48:23.533 --> 00:48:25.335
PEOPLE WORK BREAKING THE LAW

00:48:25.402 --> 00:48:26.370
IN THIS MATTER AND IT WAS A

00:48:26.436 --> 00:48:27.838
LARGER DETERRENT SO THAT HE

00:48:27.904 --> 00:48:31.241
WOULDN'T DO THIS -- YOUR OWN

00:48:31.308 --> 00:48:33.510
AGAIN TWENTY FIFTY AND IT'S

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:35.112
A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO LEADER

00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:36.313
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:37.314
IF YOU THROW SOMETHING OUT OF

00:48:37.381 --> 00:48:39.483
YOUR WINDOW IN YOUR CAR I'M

00:48:39.549 --> 00:48:42.219
NOT SEEING THE EQUITY IN IN IN

00:48:42.286 --> 00:48:43.987
A DETERRENT THERE IN THIS AND

00:48:44.054 --> 00:48:45.689
AS I MENTIONED I DON'T THINK

00:48:45.756 --> 00:48:46.857
THERE'S AN INCREMENTAL WAY

00:48:46.923 --> 00:48:49.793
TO DEATH I -- AS A FATHER WHO

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:51.862
LOST A CHILD IN A CAR ACCIDENT

00:48:51.928 --> 00:48:54.197
NOT DUE TO DISTRACTED DRIVING

00:48:54.264 --> 00:48:58.468
BUT KNOWING THE CONSEQUENCES

00:48:58.535 --> 00:48:59.736
SO I REALLY FIRMLY BELIEVE

00:48:59.803 --> 00:49:00.904
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:02.306
AND PROPERLY TREATS THIS

00:49:02.372 --> 00:49:04.374
OFFENSE IS A MINOR INFRACTION

00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:06.376
IN FACT THE TICKET FOR

00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:07.878
DISTRACTED DRIVING WHO KILLS

00:49:07.944 --> 00:49:09.546
OVER THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE

00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:11.648
ANNUALLY AS LOW AS POSSIBLE

00:49:11.715 --> 00:49:14.584
PENALTY IN THE VEHICLE CODE

00:49:14.651 --> 00:49:15.819

A POINT WILL HELP DISCOURAGES

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:23.660
DANGER DAYS BEHAVIOR IS NOT

00:49:23.727 --> 00:49:26.063
TO BE PUNITIVE IT'S TO BE

00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:28.198
A DETERRENT WE'RE NOT USING

00:49:28.265 --> 00:49:29.800
THIS AS A SLEDGE HAMMER TO

00:49:29.866 --> 00:49:31.468
STOP PEOPLE FROM DOING WE WANT

00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:32.669
THEM TO BE CONSCIOUS OF THE

00:49:32.736 --> 00:49:34.538
FACT THAT IF THEY DO DO IT

00:49:34.604 --> 00:49:37.007
AND ARE CAUGHT THIS IS GONNA

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:38.975
HAPPEN AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

POINT AFTER A SECOND VIOLATION

00:49:50.921 --> 00:49:52.155
