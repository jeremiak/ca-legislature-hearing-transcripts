WHETHER YOU'RE BRICK AND MORTAR MINE YOU'RE GOING TO BE HELD TO THE SAME PRODUCT BY THE DEATH SHOULD ANYMORE PLACE ON. IS THE- THING THE RETAIL. THAT'S REALLY ALL IT IS AND THEN THERE ARE A BUNCH OF EXEMPTIONS BECAUSE WERE EXEMPTING THE TROOPS HERE THE EBAY'S THAT SEES. THAT THE- WEB SITES THAT PROVIDE. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO BUY AND SELL AMONGST THEMSELVES AND THAT WEBSITE REALLY DOESN'T. PART IN THAT TRANSACTION. BUT IF A WEBSITE AT ALL FIND RETAILERS ACTING LIKE A RETAILER THEY SHOULD BE LIABLE. PRODUCTS THAT THEY'RE BROUGH IN CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE WE NOW HAVE COME IN THE CALIFORNIA THE PER WOULD HAVE GOT OUR MARKETS BEFORE. AND PEOPLE ARE BEING. THAT'S WHAT THE BILL DOES BAD EQUITY IT'S A FAIR IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT PRODUCTS COMING INTO CALIFORNIA OR YOU STAY FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS AS THEY POSSIBLY EIGHT I ASK YOUR I'VE- THANK YOU MISTER MISS WICKS IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. BAKER THIS I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR I'M PUTTING THIS ISSUE FORWARD AND REALLY THIS BILLS ABOUT SOME BASIC FAIRNESS YOU KNOW THERE ARE OTHERS THAT ARE BROKEN WATER. BY THE FEDERAL. IF HE- IT'S WITH OUR ONLINE RETAILERS THE AS YOU ALL KNOW MANY YOUR BUYING PRODUCTS ON AMAZON THIS IS LIKE THIS ESPECIALLY THE COVER NINETEEN WORLD I AM AS WELL AND I HAVE A THREE YEAR. AS YOU KNOW. I'M A LOT ABOUT. IN AUGUST NINETEEN FOUND THAT FOUR THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO I FOR SALE ON AMAZON DOT- BY FEDERAL AGENCIES THEY WERE ABLE TO SEPTEMBER THERE WAS SUDDENLY LABELED WORK COMPLETELY BANNED BY FEDERAL FEDERAL REGULATORS IN THOSE WERE ON SALE. ON AMAZON'S PLATFORM AMAZON ITS DOORS THE BILL. FOR THOSE PRODUCTS CURRENTLY. THE STATE IS PRODUCTS BUT AT LEAST A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN I TELL THAT AMAZON CONSIDERED BANNED INCLUDING A MAP THAT THE FDA WARNS COULD SUFFOCATE INFANTS. AMONG THOSE I DIDN'T OR AT LEAST TWO THOUSAND LISTINGS FOR TOYS CATION SELECT WARNINGS ABOUT HEALTH RISKS TO CHILDREN. THE JOURNAL COMMISSION TEST OF TEN BUCKS TEN CHILDREN THANKS. I BOUGHT ON AMAZON MANY PROMOTED AS AMAZON CHOICE PROP- PROMOTED HIGHER ABOUT PRODUCTS. 30% BASED ON. ACCORDING TO THE TESTING COME INCLUDING THE BLOOD LEVEL THAT EXCEEDED FEDERAL LIMITS THIS IS AGAIN ABOUT BASIC FAIRNESS AND ENSURING THAT ARE ONLY MARKET EVEN. SAME CENTER. I WAS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MS WICKS MISTER CUNNINGHAM IN THE REAR CHAMBER THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. MEMBERS HE COMMERCE IS THE WAY THE FUTURE THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT MY MIND AND IF YOU DOUBT THAT YOU SHOULD COME TO MY FRONT DOOR STEP. ANY BEEN DAY THERE ARE PILES. SHOWING UP. I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY COME FROM. AND THEY MOSTLY SAY AMAZON ON THEM SOMETIMES WAY FOR. BUT WE'VE GOT UNDERSTAND A CERTAIN THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE. FAIRNESS AND OPEN COMPETITION IN THE MARKETPLACE FOR THE FREE MARKET TO WORK. IF YOU BUY A DOG. AT PACO FOR EXAMPLE AND THAT DOG WHICH BREAKS AND INJURES YOU YOU CAN SUE PEKKA. TO GET REMEDY FOR YOUR INJURY PACO CAN SUE THE DOG LEASH DISTRIBUTOR AND THE MANUFACTURE ON DOWN THE CHAIN AND THERE'S INSURANCE- THE PLIES YOU CAN. PULL HOWEVER CONSIDER ACTS OF AN ACTUAL CASE FROM THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA SOMEBODY BOTTOM A DOG LEASH. FROM A COMPANY CALLED THE FURRY GET. WHICH IS LOCATED IN CHINA THEY BOUGHT ON AMAZON. SHE WENT WALKING FOR THE FIRST TIME WITH THE DOG THE DOG LUNGED AT LEAST NOT RICOCHETED BACK HERE IN THE HIGH. WE BLOCKED HER ONE I. THAT ACTUALLY HAVE. THE THIRD SIR. FEDERAL COURT OF APPEALS CONSIDER THIS ISSUE. AGAIN THE VENUE LAW BUT WE'RE TRYING TO LINE CALIFORNIA LAW PENNSYLVANIA RIGHT NOW. THE PERSON WHO WAS INJURED BY THE DOG WHICH PERMANENTLY BLINDED WENT TO SUE AMAZON AMAZON COULD NOT FIND THE MANUFACTURED I WISH THEY COULDN'T FIND HER AGAIN. WHY BY NIGHT COMPANY DISAPPEARED WASH JOURNAL HAS REPORTED THAT 40% OF PRODUCTS SOLD ON AMAZON ARE MANUFACTURED IN CHINA. I WAS ON POLICY THE ANYBODY THAT SELLS ON THEIR PLATFORM HAS TO HAVE INSURANCE AND HAVE HAS TO HAVE AN AGENT FOR SERVICE OF PROCESS. JUST SO THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN. BUT IN FACT THAT POLICY IS BADLY ENFORCED OR NOT ENFORCED. THE THIRD CIRCUIT FEDERAL COURT OF APPEALS- THE PANEL MADE UP OF APPOINTEES FROM PRESENTS A DIFFERENT PARTIES I MIGHT ADD. A RULE THAT PENNSYLVANIA LAW HELLO AMAZON STRICTLY LIVE. IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. I THINK IT'S FAIR AND I THINK THAT MODES HEALTHY COMPETITION. ONLINE AGAIN IS THE WAY THE FUTURE THE SAME WAY THE LAW CURRENTLY TREATS. LOWE'S AND HOME DEPOT. AND PEKKA I THINK THAT'S RIGHT UP THIS IS A BIG DEAL THIS BILL IS A BIG DEAL MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT'S A BIG CHANGE SMALL. WOULD BE A BIG TO DO THIS. THE LAWS MOVING THIS WAY ANYWAY I THINK AS THIS ISSUES CONSIDERED BY THE COURTS OF APPEAL IN THE SUPREME COURT THEY WILL LAND WHERE WE WENT TODAY. HAS ASTUTELY. AMENDED THE BILL TO TAKE OUT YOUR TRUE AUCTION WEBSITES LIKE EBAY AND ETSY. THOSE DO THIS BILL WOULD NOT APPLY TO THEM. SO STAND THAT IT'S TRULY TO ON LINE ORDERS.

AS WE'VE ALL HEARD THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CURRENTLY HAS INVESTIGATIONS ON A NUMBER OF FRAUDULENT PRACTICES WITHIN THE INDUSTRY AND THIS IS A CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE. THANK YOU MISTER LOWE. SAYING NOTE YES DOCTOR WOULD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS THE SET TOPIC I ACTUALLY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT- AFTER. ALMOST THIRTY YEARS OF PRACTICE- THERE ARE THERE ARE A- THERE ARE PROCEDURES AND THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE MARKET PLACE IT REALLY CONCERN ME. TELL IT MYSTERY CAN ONLY GO SO FAR- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE ORTHODONTICS. THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY JUST A COSMETIC PROCEDURE. IT IS THE IT IS THE APPLIED FORCE. THAT BREAKS DOWN BONE. AND THEN CREATES A SITUATION WHERE USE CREATE ADDITIONAL BONE TO SUPPORT THE TEETH THAT IS A MEDICAL PROCEDURE. AND IT NEEDS TO VISION. AND IT NEEDS GOOD DIAGNOSTIC RECORDS TO START WITH. ANY NEEDS HONESTY. AND THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING THE MARKETPLACE THAT VIOLATE THAT. IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT JUST A COSMETIC PROCEDURE. I HAD SHOULDER SURGERY. IN DECEMBER MY DOCTOR I WASN'T REALLY SURE THAT I HAD A TEAR IN MY ROTATOR CUFF. HE SAID WE CAN ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THE X. RAYS ARE INCONCLUSIVE WE COULD WE CAN GET CONTINUE WHAT YOU'RE DOING BUT IT'S NOT WORKING FOR YOU. I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE THAT DIAGNOSTIC STAFF. AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. AND THE MRI SHOWED THAT I HAD A COMPLETE TEAR MY ROTATOR CUFF. WE KNEW THAT. THERE ARE SITUATIONS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE MARKET PLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE ARE GETTING A LINERS WITHOUT BASIC DIAGNOSTIC X. RAYS WHY IS THAT A BIG DEAL WOULD YOU BUILD YOUR HOUSE ON A FOUNDATION WITHOUT MAKING SURE THE FOUNDATION WAS OKAY. WOULD YOU WANT YOUR TEETH MOVED AROUND IF YOU HAD DENTAL DECAY AND DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT. WHAT IF YOU HAD AN ABSCESS SOMEWHERE. AND STARTED MOVING TEETH AROUND WHAT IF YOU HAD AN IMPACTED WISDOM TOOTH AND STARTED MOVING TEETH AROUND. ALL THOSE ARE REALLY BAD THINGS QUITE FRANKLY WHAT IF YOU HAD THE BEGINNINGS OF GUM DISEASE AND DIDN'T KNOW IT BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T HAVE A PHYSICS EXAM BY A DENTIST WHO CAN MEASURE THE POCKETS AND TAKE THOSE DENTAL X. RAYS TO MAKE SURE. THAT YOU HAD A HEALTHY THE COULD ACTUALLY WITHSTAND THESE PROCEDURES. WHAT'S HAPPENING OUT THERE. IS ESSENTIALLY MAIL ORDER ORTHODONTICS WITHOUT THE SUPERVISION WITHOUT THE PHYSICAL SUPERVISION OF ANY. MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL AND THAT IS WRONG. THE BOARD OF DENTAL EXAMINERS THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS ARE THERE TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. THAT'S WHAT THIS WAS ALL ABOUT. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL I URGE YOU. TO RELY ON SCIENCE. I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR BRING THIS FOR. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION MISTER LOW YOU MAY CLOSE YOU WISH I HAVE NOTHING BAD BETTER THIS TO SAY THEN THE LINE IN THE COMMENTS WITH THE GOOD DOCTOR FROM HILLS BURKE I RESPECTFULLY ASK PRIVATE.

I'VE MAKE CLARIFICATIONS PROVIDE GREATER CERTAINTY FOR MUSICIANS WRITERS AND CERTIFY TRANSLATORS FOR PHOTOGRAPHERS MULTIMEDIA PROFESSIONALS PROFESSIONALS PROVIDING RISK MANAGEMENT AND APPRAISAL SERVICES. EXPERT JUDGES SPECIALIZED ARTISTS TO TEACH IN OTHERS THE LAW. THE PROCESS OF CRAFTING REASON. XIN FOR EACH INDUSTRY HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY INFORMED BY THE PRINCIPLES FOUND IN THE DYNAMICS KATE ITSELF. IF I CONTINUE TO WORK IN EMPLOYMENT FEEDBACK FROM WORKERS AND BUSINESSES I INTEND TO ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING THINGS IN THE SENATE.

TOGGLE TO WANT TO FOR PROP LATER THEIR CONTACT. FOR ARTIST TO PRESENT THE ORIGINAL WORK IN DRESS ANY OUTSIDE ISSUES A WILL HELP FROM COMPLY BY HIGHER BIZ. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I SO WE CAN TO GRAPPLE WITH THIS COMPLEX ISSUE. THANK YOU MS GONZALEZ MISTER KILEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR WITHOUT OBJECTION. WHEN THIS BILL WAS IN COMMITTEE- YOU SAID QUOTE THEY WERE RIGHT I WAS WRONG. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT WRITERS BUT YOU COULD JUST AS WELL I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE TWENTY OR SO. FASHIONS THAT THIS BILL FREEZE FROM THE CLUTCHES OF AB FIVE TO VARYING DEGREES. NOW I COMMEND THE ADMISSION OF RESPONSIBILITY AND I MEAN THAT SINCERELY. BUT IT ISN'T JUST THAT YOU ARE WRONG. IT'S THAT YOU LEGISLATIVE THAT MISTAKE. YOU GIVEN THE FORCE OF LAW PLEASE POINT OF ORDER MISTER CALDERON HE SAID HE HAD A QUESTION HE NEEDS ASKS QUESTIONS WHERE WHERE IS WELL TAKEN MISTER KILEY PLEASE FRAME YOUR QUESTIONS TO THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN MADE DRESSES. THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING. YOU GIVEN THE FORCE OF LAW BEFORE MAKING SURE THAT YOU ARE RIGHT. AND THE RESULT WAS. INCALCULABLE HARDSHIP. AND HEARTBREAK FOR MANY MANY PEOPLE IN OUR STATE. SO JUST LOKING AT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE AFFECTED EITHER AND- PROFESSIONS AFFECTED. BY THIS BILL. WE'VE SEEN BUSINESSES SHUTTERED. SEEN OUR LIVES UPENDED WE'VE SEEN CAREERS RUINED. SO MY QUESTION ASSEMBLY WOMAN YES IF BY YOUR OWN ADMISSION. OR WRONG ABOUT SO MANY PROFESSIONS AT SUCH A HIGH HUMAN COST LAST YEAR. WHY SHOULD WE BE CONFIDENT TODAY BUT YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE HUNDREDS OF PROFESSIONS THAT REMAINED SUBJECT EIGHTY FIVE. I'M GOING TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION DESPITE THE FACT THAT. I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IN. THE REASON I SAID THAT IT HAD TO DO SPECIFICALLY WITH HOW WE DEALT WITH FREELANCE WRITERS. DURING THE PROCESS OF AB I'VE I MET WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT REPRESENTED FREELANCE WRITERS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS WE WENT DOWN A PATH ON MISSIONS A LOT OF YOU AT THIS THE THIRTY SIX EMISSIONS. CATIONS CENTERED AROUND THE NUMBERS. WHAT'S WITH ORGAN IS THAT SELL. WHO REPRESENTED FREELANCE WRITERS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS. AFTER IT WAS SIGNED. AND PEOPLE REALIZE THIS CAME IN A DIFFERENT GROUP OF WRITERS WHO WHO WROTE IN A DIFFERENT FASHION CAME TO SEE ME AND THEY SAID THE SUBMISSION ISSUE WON'T WORK FOR US I HAD NEVER HEARD. FROM THEM THROUGH THE PROP. IN THAT WORK BECAUSE A BLOG THAT MIGHT BE ONE SUBMISSION RATHER THAN YOU'RE THINKING OF A STORY IN WHICH- I TOOK COUNTLESS MEETINGS. THEM TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. THE MISSION THAT YOU WERE RIGHT I WAS WRONG HAD TO DO WITH. IT IT CAN'T WORK FOR THEM. AND SO WE HAVE ADJUSTED IT AND CONTINUE TO DO AS WE HEAR FROM. THE JEWELS WHO HAVE ISSUES. THE FACT IS OUR LABOR CODE WASN'T MEANT AND WHAT DAY. HUNDREDS OF EXAMPLES IN SD I A WHY WHERE THEIR EXEMPTIONS IN THOSE EXEMPTIONS AND CLARIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN DONE OVER YEARS AND OUR CODE. THE SUPREME COURT GAVE US A BLUNT OBJECT AN ABC TEST BUT APPLIED TO EVERYBODY. AND THE KEY WITH HOURS THAT I'VE ACTUALLY SPENT NOT ONLINE TWEEDY MY DISSATISFACTION. BUT ACTUALLY SPENT WITH INDIVIDUAL WORKERS AND BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRIES AND ATTORNEYS. IT'S TO GET IT RIGHT AND WHEN WE DON'T GET A PERFECTLY RIGHT TO ADJUST IT. BECAUSE AFTER FORTY YEARS OF MASSIVE MISS CLASSIFICATION. IN A SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT PROVIDED A LOT OF GUIDANCE BUT REALLY NO SPECIFIC PATH. THIS IS IMPORTANT WORK TO DO. SO I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO DO IT DESPITE THIS COMPLETE INABILITY DESPITE MY OFFERS TO SIT DOWN WITH ANY MEMBER OF THIS LEGISLATURE WHO WANTS TO COME TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS. AND I WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE YOUR CRITICISM AND YOUR QUESTIONS BUT IT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU ACTUALLY THOUGHT TO FIX THIS. FIX WHAT NEXT GAVE US TO. WORK ON THIS ISSUE AND MAKE SURE THAT WORKERS ARE PROTECTED BECAUSE DURING THIS PANDEMIC WE HAVE LEARNED MORE THAN EVER WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WORKERS HAVE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. WE'VE LEARNED WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WORKERS HAVE PAID SICK DAYS WHERE THEY HAVE ONLY LEAVE. HEALTH CARE. RATHER THAN JUST TRYING TO BLOW IT UP. AND SUGGEST THAT SOMEHOW THE BARTENDER AT A CATERING BUSINESS SHOULD BE IN IT CONTRACTOR THEY WERE NEVER. WELL THAT'S JUST FLAMBOYANT POLITICAL TALK IN NOT SEEKING SOLUTIONS I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO SEEK SOLUTIONS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK THROUGH THIS. MR KILEY YOU MAY CONCLUDE YOUR REMARKS. TO BE CLEAR I DID ATTEMPT TO FIX IT WITH THE BILL- MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIG BEAR ATTEMPTED TO FIX IT WITH A BILL OF HIS OWN. NEITHER RECEIVED A HEARING. THIS IS BEEN THE STANDARD RESPONSE WE'VE GOTTEN TO ALL OF THE BREAKING. NEW OKAY PERFECT WE'RE WORKING. IT OUT WE'RE MEETING WITH PEOPLE. THAT'S WHAT YOU DO BEFORE YOU PASS THE- NOT. A YES WE HER SIGN. THE RELEASE. BETWEEN AND GOVERNMENT THIRTY SECONDS. NO NOW I CAN I HER TIME IS NOT COUNT TOWARDS MY SPEECH. IT USED TO BE WHERE YOU HAVE THE SECONDS REMAINING I DO NOT HAVE THIRTY SECONDS REMAINING HIS RECOUNTING HER TIME. IS THAT POINT OF ORDER. WE SHOULD HAVE A WHEN YOU ASK A QUESTION IS ADDRESSED BY THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THE CLOCK IS RUNNING IT WAS A LONG QUESTION A CONSIDERABLE ANSWER YOU MAY CONCLUDE YOUR YOUR POINTS WE HAVE ADDITIONAL DEBATE. ON THE FLOOR. THAT IS NEVER A THAT RULES BEEN ENFORCED IN THIS CHAMBER THE EXPRESSION IS ON MY OWN TIME BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT COUNTING THE RESPONSE. BUT I WILL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS AND THAT I KNOW THERE'S ANOTHER BILL ON THIS TOPIC SO I ILL USE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS. THANK YOU MISTER KILEY MISTER OBERNOLTE. YOUR RECOGNIZE I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER OF THIS BILL MAKES SOME MODEST IMPROVEMENTS TO THE FRAMEWORK OF AB FIVE LAST YEAR- IN THE SPIRIT OF TRYING TO BE HELPFUL I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST SOME WAYS. THAT IT COULD BE FURTHER IMPROVED UNFORTUNATELY THE CORONAVIRUS SITUATION IN THE SHORTENED LEGISLATIVE CALENDAR CURTAILED. OUR ABILITY TO HAVE THAT DEBATE THIS YEAR BUT MAKE NO MISTAKE IS A DEBATE. NEEDS TO BE HAD. SO THIS BILL ADDS A COUPLE MORE PROFESSIONS TO THE LIST OF INDUSTRIES THAT ARE GOOD EXAMPLES. FOR OUR GOVERNMENT BY THE CARRILLO TEST. FORTUNE IT ALL STRAIGHT ONE PROBLEM THE BEEF. AB FIVE SAYS HERE THE NEW RULES FOR WORKER CLASSIFICATION IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THEN SPENDS PAGES AND PAGES AND PAGES OF STATE CODE TALKING ABOUT EXEMPTIONS EXEMPTIONS FOR THIS INDUSTRY EXEMPTIONS FOR THAT N. STREET. BILL ATTIC EXEMPTIONS FOR MUSICIANS RADIC EXEMPTIONS FOR YOU SPORTS COACHES WERE EXEMPTIONS FOR INSURANCE AGENTS BUT LET ME SUGGEST THAT THE WAY THAT THE BILL SHOULD WORK IN THE WAY THAT STATE COACH WOULD WORK. THAT WOULD BE FINE- PLAN WORK THAT WAY. EVERYBODY AND I A COUPLE SUBJECT IN THAT LINE I. THE WE EXPAND THE PROFESSIONS UNDER AB FIVE TO CALL ALL OF THE PROFESSIONS IN THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE THOSE ARE PROFESSIONS THAT ALREADY HAVE CODE SECTIONS DEDICATED TO THEM WE CAN LEGISLATE- TWEAKS TO. THE RULES FOR THOSE INDUSTRIES UNDER THE BNP CODE I DON'T THINK THAT WE NEED TO GO INDUSTRY- UP A BY INDUSTRY IN- THE FRAMEWORK OF AB FIVE. I ALSO THINK WHAT'S BADLY NEEDED HIS BIGGEST TURN FOR HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS. THAT IS SOMETHING WE WOULDN'T BE INVENTING THE WHEEL THAT'S ARE FAR AND STATE CODE IN THE WAGE. ARE THOSE. THAT HAVE THE POWER TO NEGOTIATE WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS AND I THINK THAT AN EXEMPTION FOR THEM WOULD REALLY HELP TO CLICK. BY THE BIG. SO AB FIVE IS IT SAYS THAT. IF YOUR WORKERS PERFORMING WORK THAT'S IN THE USUAL COURSE OF A BUSINESS FOR A COMPANY THAT COMPANY CANNOT CLASSIFY THEM. AS EMPTY AS A- CONTRACTOR BUT WE NEVER DEFINE. WHAT USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS MEANS AND UNFORTUNATELY AT LACK OF SPECIFICITY JUST THROWS IT OPEN TO THE COURT. THE INTERPRETATION OF THAT CODE SECTION AND FRANKLY THAT IS THE PROBLEM THAT LED TO THE ORIGINAL WORLD DECISION. AND THE DYNAMICS DECISION IS THIS LEGISLATURE'S. TO DEFINE IT STATE CODE EXACTLY REMAIN. TO FIX THE PROBLEM. AND THEN LASTLY LET ME SAY THAT WE BADLY NEED TO CREATE A SMALL BUSINESS EXEMPTION IN AB FIVE. YOU KNOW THE THIRTY YEARS AGO I STARTED A COMPANY OUT OF MY COLLEGE DORM ROOM I CAN TELL YOU WITH HAVE BEEN IT. AB FIVE THEN THE LAW AND- COLLEAGUES IS TOO HARD TO START A BUSINESS. WITH TRYING TO HIRE EMPLOYEES AND COMPLY WITH A COMPLEX FRAMEWORK AND DELETIONS THAT THAT ENTAILS. SO I FEAR. THAT AB FIVE. WORK FOR THE COMPANIES THAT IS REALLY GOING TO HAVE A DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON ENTREPRENEUR REALLY. CALIFORNIA UNFORTUNATELY. COMPANIES THAT THAT AT THAT ARE CREATED HERE AND THE JOBS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ADDED HERE WILL STILL BE CREATED. BUT THEY'LL BE CREATED AND OTHER STATES IN THE PROSPERITY THAT COMES WITH THEM WILL BE TOO. SO I. THE WAY I HAD ONE THAT THIS YEAR. HEARD WHAT ARE THIS LEGISLATURE. YEAH. CERTAINLY MAKES SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO THE FRAMEWORK OUR OF MODEST AND I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE MISTER KALRA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- AND I WHAT I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM OUR COLLEAGUES IN AND RECOGNIZING THAT THIS BILL- DOES MAKE IMPROVEMENTS THE REALITY IS- DYNAMAX WAS A LANDMARK CASE OF THAT THEN THROUGH UPON US LEGISLATURE TO TRY NOT JUST TO INTERPRET BUT WITH THE SAID IT WAS VERY CLEAR AND CLASSIFICATION. AND MADE ISSUE MANY. AB GIVE US OUR- TO TRY OUR TO. THE INTER. OF THAT CASE IN HOW IT'S ACTUALLY DEFINE AND A- ULTIMATELY BY THE STATE- BY THE ADMINISTRATION. I AND I JUST WANT ABOVE I FELT THE NEED TO AT LEAST RESPOND. TO THE RANGE OF OUR COLLEAGUE FROM ROOSEVELT- THAT A BILL WASN'T HEARD. MY COMMITTEE JUST LIKE MANY OTHERS THE BILL THAT WAS HEARD WAS THIRD 240% OF THOSE WERE INTRODUCED WE DID HAVE A LOT OF BILLS THAT WERE INTRODUCED RELATED- TO DYNAMICS AND RELATED TO AB FIVE BOTH REPUBLICAN AND- DEMOCRAT. A BIPARTISAN BILLS THAT WERE PUT FORWARD OF THE FARMER JORDY OF THOSE ENTITIES BILLS NEVER ACTUALLY SPOKE TO ME ABOUT BILLS THEY INTRODUCE WE DID HAVE A BIPARTISAN BOWED BUT REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT BILL IDEAS THAT WERE BROUGHT TO ME THAT WERE ACTUALLY INCORPORATED. SUBSEQUENTLY. MISTER CALDERON STAGE ONE ORDER I JUST WANT TO REMIND MEMBERS THAT WERE HERE TALKING ABOUT AB FIFTY EIGHT EIGHTEEN FIFTY. THE SUBJECT MATTER WITH WHICH YOU SPEAK HAS TO BE ON OF THAT BILL DIRECTLY WITH THE SUBJECT MATTER THAT IS IN. THAT BILL NOT ON ANYTHING ELSE I JUST WANT MEMBERS TO PLEASE STAY ON POINT WITH THE SUBJECT MATTR THAT IS ACTUALLY IN THIS BILL THAT WE ARE TO BE. RIGHT NOW. AT POINT OF ORDER IS. MISTER AROUND YOUR CAR CAN FIND TIME AS TO WHAT IS YOUR MAIN O THE- AND FOR OF THE BODY. THANK YOU AND I WAS MINOR. POINT IS THAT. THOSE I'D HAVE BEEN A COURT. IN THIS A LOT. BECAUSE THOSE AUTHORS ACTUALLY REACHED OUT. TO THE LABOR COMMITTEE THEY ACTUALLY REACHED OUT TO THE AUTHOR- OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THOSE ARE NEVER ONCE CALLED ME TALK TO ME. ACTUALLY PASS HIM UP. TIME THIS BILL IS NOT OUTRAGED GET A- AND SO THE TWO RAGE BE REAL. BUT THE RAY OF THAT IS BEING A- HERE DOES NOT REPRESENT HOW BILLS GET PASSED IN THIS ABOUT. OR GET THIS. IT'S NO WONDER DOESN'T HAVE MANY TO HIS NAME. IS BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY TO TALK TO YOUR COLLEAGUES I ACTUALLY HAVE TO WORK YES YOU HAVE TO. WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES IN ORDER TO TRY TO FIND COMMON GROUND AND THAT SOMETHING THAT IS AMERICANS OFF US HAS DONE EVEN WHEN SHE CAN'T FIND COMMON. WITH CALL. HER DOORS BEEN OPEN FOR THE I COMMANDER THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER KALRA MISTER. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE RICH. THANK MISTER SPEAKER PERMISSION TO READ. MR MANHATTAN JUST A HEADLINE FROM LAW PLEASE CONFIRM WITH THE THAT STOP THE CLOCK PLEASE COME THE COULD MAJOR LEADER. WITHOUT OBJECTION MISTER MATHIS MAY PROCEED THANK YOU FOR PERMISSION MISTER SPEAKER. SHOW MEMBERS WHEN I WANT TO READ HERE IS FROM THE- GLOBAL NEWS WIRE. THE HEAD LAMBERT HEADLINE READS THE FUTURE OF WORK IS HERE. FREELANCE ECONOMY OFFERS UNPARALLELED OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH MOVES TO CLOSE THE GENDER GAP. THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THIS ARTICLE READS. NEW YORK FEBRUARY FIFTH TWENTY TWENTY. PIONEERED TODAY ISSUED ITS FREELANCE ECONOMY REPORT BASED ON A SURVEY OF OVER SEVEN THOUSAND FREELANCERS FROM OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY COUNTRIES PROVIDING NEW INSIGHT INTO THE WORLD OF FREELANCERS. THEIR MOTIVATIONS AND HOW THEIR UNIQUE WORK FORCE AND POWERS OF GLOBAL COLLABORATORS BY CONNECTING TOP. TALENT WITH BUSINESS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. THE REPORT TELLS THE STORY OF AN AMBITIOUS AND COURAGEOUS WORK FORCE THAT IS ON WILLING TO SETTLE FOR THE STATUS QUO. FREELANCING POPULARITY IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE POTENTIAL FOR GREATER JOB OPPORTUNITY. INDEPENDENCE HIGHER INCOMES AND A PROMISING MOVE IN THE DIRECTION OF WAGE EQUALITY. MEMBERS WE HEAR THESE THINGS OF CLOSING THE WAGE GAP WOULD YOU QUALITY. BETTER OPPORTUNITY DALY. MY QUESTION TO YOU AS WE VOTE ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION ANY ANYTHING DEALING WITH THE FREELANCER ECONOMY IS TO REALLY THINK ON WHAT WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS BECAUSE THE EXPERTS IN THE ECONOMY TELL US THAT THE FREELANCE ECONOMY. IS CLOSING THAT GAP IS PROVIDING BETTER OPPORTUNITY THIS PROVIDING BETTER ECONOMICAL OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE. IN TO PREACH A QUALITY IN EQUITY. WE NEED REALLY CONSIDER THESE THINGS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION. MS GONZALEZ YOU MAY CLOSE I WANT TO CLOSE BY INVITING ANY MEMBER OF THIS LEGISLATURE IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY IN MANY OF YOU HAVE TO COME TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS ISSUE AS IT MOVES FORWARD SAME AS LAST YEAR. THE WORD LIVER THE DYNAMICS TO. AND A LOT OF YOU HAVE HONESTLY COME UP TO ME AND SAY. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE SUNBECAUSE WHO TO BE. TO THIS. I DO MIND THAT BE WHEN HAPPENED BOTH BUSINESS FAMILY. CAME RUNNING TWICE FOR CLARA. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING THROUGH IT'S THE BIGGEST LABOR LAW CHANGES IN DECADES IN CALIFORNIA AND I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO DO THAT. BUT A SPEECH FOR THREE MINUTES ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR TO GET YOUR POINT ACROSS SUGGESTS TO ME WHEN YOU'VE NEVER STEPPED INTO MY OFFICE THAT YOU'RE NOT REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT FIXING WHATEVER IF YOU HAVE. IT'S JUST ME THAT YOU'RE MORE CONCERNED WITH MAKING A POLITICAL STATEMENT. THIS IS NOT A POLITICAL STATEMENT TO ME. I KNOW THAT FREELANCERS IF YOU WILL INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THEY HAVE NO PROTECTIONS FOR PAY EQUITY. THEY HAVE NO PROTECTIONS FOR RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. THEY HAVE NO PROTECTIONS THAT WE HAVE AS EMPLOYEES. AND SO TO READ FROM AN ARTICLE IN SUGGEST THAT'S AN ECONOMIC EXPERT ON THE FLOOR WHEN YOU'VE NEVER COME TALK TO ME ABOUT ANY ISSUE CONCERNING WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE. AGAIN SUGGESTS TO ME THAT YOU'RE NOT SEEKING SALUTE SEEKING. THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM HERE FOR ME THROUGH THE- PIECE OF THIS. WITH MUSE. OWN THANK ALL THE INDUSTRY FOLKS WORKERS. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE COME TO ME ON ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT WE COULD WORK THROUGH THEM AND GET IT RIGHT. I AM COMMITTED TO GETTING. THIS ALL MEANS. MY WORK.

THE BEFORE DYNAMAX THOUSAND WORKERS WERE FOUND MISCLASSIFIED BY ET DE NOT BECAUSE SOMEBODY COMPLAIN BECAUSE JUST THROUGH AN AUDIT PROCEDURE. FOUR THOUSAND MUSICIANS FOUR THOUSAND INTERPRETERS. THIS IS A REAL ISSUE THAT AFFECTS PEOPLE'S LIVES IN A CAME TO BEAR WITH ME FAMILY LOST THEIR JOB IN HAD NO UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.

THOSE WHO HAVE I'LL- WE WERE. ALWAYS AGREE A HUNDRED FOR. BUT WILL. THROUGH WHERE WE'RE GOING AND WHY. IT'S NOT RANDOM. IF YOU LOOK AT OUR CURRENT YOU Y.

IT'S A LOT OF WHAT. I ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN THIS WORK AND I ASK YOU TO VOTE I IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY. THANK YOU MS HAS ALSO ACTOR FOR OF THE ROLE. THE DESIRE TO VOTE ALL MY VOTERS TO VOTE.

THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER IN MEMBERS. TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT IT TO BE NOT. THIRTY YESTERDAY. YOUR THE CHAMBER WAS A HISTORIC DAY. AS WE PASS. A FIVE. TO GIVE VOTERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO OVERTURN PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE. BUT A NAME THAT WAS NOT MENTIONED IN YESTERDAY'S DEBATE. WAS A GENTLEMAN BY THE NAME OF WARD CONNERLY. WARD CONNERLY WAS A UC REGENT. SB FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PASSED PROPOSITION. TWO OH NINE. THE UC BECAME THE FIRST. HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION IN THE COUNTRY TO GET RID OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE. SO YOU SEE YOU GOT RID OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE LED BY WARD CONNERLY THE FOLLOWING YEAR HE ALSO HELPED SPEAR. BOB THE PASSING OF PROPOSITION. TWO OH NINE. WHEN YOU SEE. GOT RID OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER I SAW THE NUMBERS OF LATINO AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS INYO IN UC. A LOT OF. CERTAINLY LORD WE SAW ALSO IN THE SCHOOLS THE PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS THE SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE RULES OF LAW UCLA UC BERKELEY SAW THOSE NUMBERS ALSO GO DOWN. THIS PAST YEAR WE SAW CSU. ASKS OR NOT ASKS BUT OF REYES ARE THERE ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. ATTY A AN EXTRA YEAR OF. OF A QUANTITATIVE REASONING AS PART OF THEIR ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS THEY DID IT WITH OUT ANY CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WITH K. TWELVE OR WITH THE LEAD LATER FOR THAT MATTER. AND THEN AFTER MUCH DEBATE AFTER HUNDREDS OF CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS CAME OUT IN OPPOSITION TO THAT ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE REQUIREMENT FOR CSU. AND AFTER HEARING HERE BY HIGHER ED. COMMITTEE SEE ISSUE AGREED TO POSTPONE OR TO NOT IMPLEMENT THE QUANTITATIVE REASONING OF REQUIREMENT. AS CHAIR OF HIGHER ED I CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT IT IS. WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. AS A STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO REMOVE OBSTACLES. SO THAT WE CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MINORITY STUDENTS LIKE THE YOU KNOW AFRICAN AMERICANS IN BOTH CSU AND UC. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT'S REQUIRED CSU TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT TO GIVE MORE OVERSIGHT FOR THEM TO. MAKE SURE THAT THEY STUDY THE IMPACT OF WHAT. CHANGING THEIR ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS WOULD DO ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO MINORITY STUDENTS. AND WOULD INCLUDE COORDINATED IMPLEMENTATION PLANS WITH PUBLIC ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS.

MYSTERY OF US YOU ARE RECOGNIZED MADAM SPEAKER- GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PERCENT THIS BILL SENATE BILL TWO ZERO FOUR THREE. WHICH ADDRESSES. NO SAFETY AND HEALTH OF OUR STATE AGRICULTURAL WORKERS- MISS THIS OCTOBER NINETEEN HEALTH CRISIS WERE UNDER. EVERY DAY FOR THE CROSS OUR STATE RISE EARLY. LEAVING BEHIND THEIR FAMILIES TO PACK IN CROWDED. THE BUSES THEY WORK SHOULDER TO SHOULDER IN THE FIELDS. THEIR DAYS ARE LONG ONES. THE WORK THEY DO IS HARD. IT BREAKS DOWN THE BODY OVER TIME MY GRANDFATHER WHO RAISED ME THE FARM WORKER. AND I SAW HOW HARD. HE WORKED FOR FIFTY YEARS OF HIS LIFE AS A FARM WORKER. DID THIS WORK DAY IN AND DAY OUT. AND HE DID IT FOR BARELY ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AND IS NOW MANY FARMWORKERS ARE UNDOCUMENTED. HERE CALIFORNIA AND IN THE UNITED STATES. THEY LACK ACCESS TO THE HEALTH CARE THAT MANY OF US TAKE FOR GRANTED. UNFORTUNATELY CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. AMONG FARMWORKERS ARE VERY VERY COMMON. AND VIRUSES VIRUSES CAN SPREAD QUICKLY. YOU SEE IT'S NOT JUST THAT FARMWORKERS WORKING CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER. IS THAT THEY HANDLE THAT YOU KNOW THE SAME EQUIPMENT AND- THE TRACTORS IN THE MACHINES THAT THEY USE BUT THEY ALSO LIVE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER. AT LEAST ONE APARTMENT OR A SINGLE FAMILY HOME WHERE WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO SUBLET ROOMS GARAGES SHEDS WHATEVER SPACE IS MADE AVAILABLE. HERE THE GOAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IF SOMEONE GETS SICK IT'S HARD TO KEEP THEM SEPARATED CAN'T SHELTER IN PLACE THE CAT SOCIAL DISTANCE. AND AS LONG AS THE PANDEMIC CONTINUES OUR FARMWORKERS ARE AT RISK AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE A MORAL DUTY TO PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER OTHER FOOD RELATED INDUSTRIES. A COVERT NINETEEN OUTBREAK IN OUR FARM WORKER. POPULATIONS IN OUR OUT COMMUNITIES THEY WOULD THREATEN OUR FOOD SUPPLY NOT ONLY OUR STATE FOOD SUPPLY OUR NATIONAL FOOD SUPPLY. FARMERS I THERE ARE PARTNERS IN THIS EFFORT. MOST OF THEM UNDERSTAND THE RISK THAT THEIR WORKERS THAT FARM WORKERS FACE EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY CARE ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THEY WANT TO KEEP THEM SAFE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT OUR STATE OUR COUNTRY WE WERE CLEARLY UNPREPARED TO HANDLE THE HISTORIC. PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING. AND RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A PATCHWORK OF SAFETY GUIDANCE ACROSS OUR STATE. AND SUCH GUIDES CAN BE DIFFERENT FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS CLEAR OR STANDARDIZED AND SO THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO CREATE A CLEAR UNIFORM STANDARD. THAT APPLIES TO ALL AGRICULTURAL WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. IT'LL MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR FARMERS WANT TO IMPLEMENT BEST PRACTICES. IT'LL KEEP FARMWORKERS SAFEWHICH IS IN EVERYONE'S BEST INTEREST. WE SHOULD BE MAKING THE SAFETY THESE GUYS DECISIONS ON A COUNTY BY COUNTY LEVEL IT'S TOO INCONSISTENT TWO ONE EVEN IT'S TOO COMPLICATED FOR FARMERS AND IT LEAVES TOO MANY FARMWORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES AT RISK. WE NEED A SINGLE A BUS AT. GUIDELINES TO PROTECT AGRICULTURAL WORKERS FROM COLD IN NINETEEN. THIS LEGISLATION IT DOES THAT BY ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE IN THREE WAYS FIRST. IT REQUIRES AT AND CAL OSHA ARE THE ESTABLISH AT THE END. EXCUSE ME THE DECEPTICON THEN SAFETY GUIDELINES FOR AGRICULTURE EMPLOYEES. I LIVE ON THEIR OWN ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE. AND SO SECOND THE BILL ALSO DIRECTS CAL OSHA STANDARDS BOARD TO ADOPT OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS FOR KOBE NINETEEN INFECTION PREVENTION STANDARDS THAT CAN BE ENFORCED THIRTY SECONDS BUT STANDARDS ONE CLUE BUT NOT LIMITED TO SANITATION PRACTICES PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND PHYSICAL DISS THE REQUIREMENTS. AND THIRD THIS BILL IMPLEMENTS A PART OUT REACH CAMP IN TO AGRICULTURE WORKERS ON THESE BEST PRACTICES TO STAY STATE IS STAY SAFE FROM THE NINE. WE NEED. A STATE IN THE COUNTRY IS THAT OKAY DEEMED FORMER AS ESSENTIAL WE'VE SEEN A PATCHWORK OF AGRICULTURE WORKPLACE SAFETY DEPENDS ON OUR STATE. WHAT THIS BILL IS ASKING FOR IS IT MUCH. MANY FARMERS HAVE BEEN GIVEN LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO PROTECT THEMSELVES IN SOME AREAS OF THE STATE THE PLAN TO KEEP FARMWORKERS SAY SAY IT IS UNCLEAR. EMERGENCY STANDARD WHAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE NOW BEFORE FARMWORKERS GETS SICK IN OUR FOOD SUPPLY IS THREATENED. WE MUST ALSO STAY CLEAR EYED ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO HERE TO PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE FARMWORKERS THE CENTRAL WORKERS WHO HAVE PUT THEIR LIFE ON THE LINE FOR ALL OF US SO WE COULD KEEP FOOD. TABLE DURING THIS PENDANT. BILLS ALL. THANKYOU. PETER WAS BUT- THANK YOU. MR GARCIA YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND COLLEAGUES I RISE IN. FULL SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FORTY THREE AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE. FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. YOU KNOW YOU'VE HEARD ME SPEAK. SEVERAL TIMES A ABOUT THE REGION THAT I REPRESENT IMPERIAL COUNTY COULD TELL A VALLEY. LARGELY AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY- BASED ECONOMY. AND YOU'VE ALSO HEARD ME TALK ABOUT THE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES THAT EXIST IN THAT REGION THE HIGHEST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. REPORT THIS CAME OUT WE ARE NOW AT 26% IN LIKELY WHEN WE HAVE OUR HANDS AROUND. THE WE GOV HE ECONOMY SHUT DOWN WILL PROBABLY BE CLOSER TO THE 3540% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. AND JUST RECENTLY. THE REGION WAS ALSO HIGHLIGHTED. WITH THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF PER CAPITA POSITIVE COVERT NINETEEN CASES THE MAJORITY OF THOSE CASES CONSISTING OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS IN OUR REGION MAJORITY OF THOSE ESSENTIAL WORKERS BEING AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. INDIVIDUALS WHO IF YOU LIVE IN PER COUNTY- CROSSING THE BORDER EVERY SINGLE DAY TO WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE FOOD ON OUR TABLES IN OUR GROCERY STORES AND SUPPLYING THE LONG. CHAIN OF FOOD SUPPLY THAT EIST IN OUR- LOW COUNTRY AND OF COURSE IN OUR STATE. AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT ISN'T INTERRUPTED- NOT ONLY TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY BUT AN IMPACT ON THE CONFERENCE. THAT WE ALL HAVE WHEN WE GET UP ARE ABLE TO GO TO THE GROCERY STORE TO BUY THE THINGS THAT WE NEED. THE DENTAL FOR EVERY. OUR LIVES. WHAT THE IN HERE IN THE HAVE ALL POLL INCLUDING MY FOR TRYING TO IS THAT WE ARE PROTECTING AGRICULTURE. THE FOOD AND SAFETY COMPONENT OF THE FOOD SUPPLY. AND WE KNOW THAT IF WE PROTECT THE WORKERS. WE ACCOMPLISHED ALL THE LIVES AS WELL. AND SO IT IS A MODEST ASK TO HAVE THE APPROPRIATE AGENCIES WORKING WITH OUR AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITIES. TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF THE SAFEGUARDS ARE IN PLACE THE PROTECTIONS ON FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THE- ULTIMATE WE CAN CONTINUE TO BE. A HEALTHY WORKFORCE. CONTRIBUTING TO THE OVERALL ECONOMIC WELL BEING OF OUR STATE. ROOM THE RECALL CAROL WORK THAT HAPPENS IN CALIFORNIA AND SOMEONE THANK THE AUTHOR AGAIN FOR BRINGING THIS MEASURE FORWARD.

CLERK WILL CLOSE THE ROLE IN TALLY VOTE ICE FIFTY KNOWS NINE THE MEASURE PASSES. MISTER CALDERON FOR WHAT REASON DO YOU RISE. I HAVE A MOTION YOU ARE RECOGNIZED FOR YOUR MOTION. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I REQUEST UNANIMOUS CONSENT TO SUSPEND THE RULES TO ALLOW ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER TO TAKE HAVE AS H. R. NINETY SEVEN TODAY WITHOUT REFERENCE THE FILE THE PURPOSE OF IT. WITHOUT OBJECTION TO BE THE ORDER. YEAH WE WILL TAKE UP THE- ITEM WITHOUT. WE WILL TAKE AT THE ITEM THAT REFERENCE FILE HOUSE RESOLUTION NINETY SEVEN THE CLERK WILL READ HOUSE RESOLUTION NINETY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRAZIER ANOTHER'S RELATIVE RAIL MISTER FRAZIER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. YOU MADAM SPEAKER. MEMBERS PRESENT HR NINETY SEVEN RELATED TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S HIGH SPEED RAIL BUSINESS PLAN. HR NINETY SEVEN RE DIRECTS THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY TO HOLD OFF ON ENTERING INTO MAJOR CONTRACTS AND TO LEGISLATURE CAN WEIGH IN THROUGH THE APPROPRIATION OF BOND FUNDS. THE AUTHORITY STATES IN ITS DRAFT AND THAT IT PLANS TO ENTER INTO TWO MAJOR ACTS THIS FALL. ONE SIGN THESE CONTRACTS WILL PRECLUDE ANY DISCUSSION FOR ANY ALTERNATIVE PROJECT DIRECTION OF THE AUTHORITY GOES. ESSENTIALLY ONCE THESE CONTRACTS ARE LET THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE ON THE HOOK FOR FIFTEEN SESSIONS GOING DOWN THE ROAD. AND LEFT OUT OF THE CONVERSATION ENTIRELY. BUT WE WILL STILL BE ASKED TO PAY FOR IT. I PERSONALLY HAVE LOST ALL CONFIDENCE IN THIS GROUP TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER WHAT THEY PROMISE. EVERY BUSINESS PLAN HAS BEEN MORE COSTLY AND LESS SCOPE OFFERED. BERMAN INCONSISTENT COST ESTIMATES TO IMPOSSIBLE PROJECT SCHEDULES THEY PROVIDE FICTIONAL RIDERSHIP EXPECTATION AND EXAGGERATED BENEFITS. THEY'VE EXPERIENCED NEARLY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN CHANGE ORDERS AND WHO HAS BENEFITS NOT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN SPENT ON CONSULTANTS. THE WAY THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN MANAGED IS EMBARRASSING TO SAY THE LEAST AND NOW THEY WANT US WANT TO FORCE US TO DOUBLE DOWN BY AWARDING CONTRACTS BEFORE WE SEE THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATE THE FUNDS FOR THEM. THIS IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. REGARDLESS OF HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HIGH SPEED RAIL THIS RESOLUTION MAKES IT CLEAR THAT THE ASSEMBLY WILL NOT BE SUPPORT OF ANY DEPARTMENT TRYING TO USE THESE TACTICS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. TAKING CARE MR FUNG YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY AS A CO AUTHOR OF HOUSE RESOLUTION NINETY SEVEN. MEMBERS WE FACE A CRUCIAL JUNCTURE WITH HIGH SPEED RAIL. TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY SIGN THESE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR CON CONSTRUCTING TRACKS WITHOUT FIRST ALLOWING THE LEGISLATURE TO APPROVE ITS FUNDING WE WILL ESSENTIALLY HAVE OUR HANDS TIED. WE MUST NOT PERMIT UNELECTED BUREAUCRATS TO MAKE THIS DECISION IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO BE STEWARDS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS BECAUSE IT IS NOT OUR MONEY IS THE MONEY OF HARD WORKING CALIFORNIA. SOMETHING THAT WE MUST ALWAYS BINDER OFFICE WE HAVE SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN ALL THE REASONS WHY WE MUST STOP FUNDING THIS MESS MISMANAGED FLAWED AND NEVER ENDING PROJECT WE SHOULD HAVE HALTED THIS PROJECT A LONG TIME AGO. BUT IS EVEN MORE GLARING AND LOT OF OUR MASSIVE BUDGET DEFICIT AND THE THREAT OF CUTS TO EDUCATION AND HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS. WE SHOULD NOT FINALLY SUPPORT CONTINUING THIS PROJECT. THE WORST THING WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW IS LOCK OURSELVES INTO MULTIPLE THIRTY YEAR CONTRACTS. THIS WOULD BE THE HEIGHT OF IRRESPONSIBILITY FOR THE EXECUTION. ARE WE PREPARED TO PRIORITIZE THIS MISMANAGED PROJECT OVER ALL OF THE COUNTLESS PROGRAMS THAT WILL BE THAT SLATED TO BE CUT IN OUR BUDGET. HOW CAN WE PRIOR TO THIS TRAIN OVER PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT FIRST RESPONDERS HELP TEACHERS EDUCATE FUTURE GENERATIONS AND PROVIDE DOCTORS THE EQUIPMENT AND FUNDING TO HELP SAVE LIVES IN OUR STATE. TO ME THAT'S UNTHINKABLE. TO THAT END I THANK CHAIRMAN FRAZIER FOR IT INTRODUCING THIS RESOLUTION THAT WILL HELP CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATION OF THE MERITS OF THIS PROJECT I RESPECTFULLY ASK. ABOUT. THANK YOU MISTER FONG MS RIVAS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR NINETY SEVEN I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION THIS YEAR THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED. SPEED RAIL OF. THE VALUE IT ALL BUT IT IS TO THE CURRENT APPROACH TO CONSTRUCTION GIVING GIVEN THE COST OVER RUNS CHANGED IN TIMELINE. I HELD THAT LEGISLATION THIS YEAR. RESULT COMMITMENTS THAT I RECEIVED FROM THE AUTHORITY TO ENGAGE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THIS BODY. I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE A FORTY GAUGE WITH ALL OF US HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY MOST OF US NONE OF US WERE HERE TO VOTE. ON IN THE PAST ON THIS BOND AND WE NEXT YEAR OUR DECISION TO- APPROPRIATE. BOND FUNDS AND WE WILL ALL NEED TO MAKE THAT DECISION TOGETHER SO I THINK IT'S A PORTENT TO STARTING GATE WITH US HEY. CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH. I GET IT DEFICIT. I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO LONG TERM CONTRACTS UNTIL THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAD A CHANCE TO WAY YET. I BELIEVE WE MUST BE TOPPLING CAUTIOUS WITH OUR LIMITED FUNDS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORITY MY COLLEAGUES- AND- IT IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS TO COME. I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON HR NINETY SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER DO YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL SYSTEM WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY IS IMMENSELY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WAS PROMISED TO VOTERS TWELVE YEARS AGO. JUST IN THE PROMISED TO BRING BENEFITS TO VARIOUS REGIONS BY CONNECTING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA POPULATION HERBS TO THOSE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. HAS FALLEN. DRAMATICALLY AND SADLY SHORT. COLLEAGUES IS RESOLUTION IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TOWARDS GAINING BACK OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE INPUT BEFORE KEY DECISIONS ARE MADE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS PROJECT. WE OWE IT TO THE RESIDENTS OF OUR STATE PROVIDE APPROPRIATE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AND THOUGHT CONSIDERATION PROJECT ALTERNATIVES. SO THAT EVENTUALLY. ALL CALIFORNIANS WAS MAY SEE THE BENEFITS FROM HIGH SPEED RAIL I RESPECT WESTERN TYPE OF. IF YOU'RE WE ARE. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I RISE AS A PROUD COOPER OF THIS RESOLUTION AND TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT BEFORE US THE DRAFT HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY VISIT REQUIRES HIS BODY THREE BILLION. DOLLARS TO THIS PROJECT THEY WERE HIGHER THIS AT A TIME WHEN WE RE DEBATING CUTS TO EDUCATION HEALTH CARE SENIOR. AND OTHER. THINGS THAT NOT WANT TO TOUCH. MEANWHILE THE SPEED RAIL PRETTY IS CONTINUE TO BALLOON COSTS WHAT THE SAME TIME LET. GO OF THE PROJECT THE DRAFT PLAN LACK DETAILS. LACKS OVERSIGHT OF IF THE- TO CONNECT OUR STATE IN AN ECONOMICALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY MEANINGFUL WAY. THERE ARE MANY QUESTIONS YET TO BE ANSWERED IN THIS BUSINESS PLAN THESE QUESTIONS ARE AS BROAD AS HOW MANY WRITERS WILL THIS TRAIN HAVE AND HOW MUCH WILL IT COST. WRITERS I. WILL AND RELY TRANSFER. AND I AM A HUGE BELIEVER IN CLEAN RAIL PROJECTS THAT EXTEND ECONOMIC BENEFITS TO ALL CORNERS OF THE STATE. BUT WE NEED TO HAVE A CLEAR AND THOUGHT A PLAN TO CONNECT THE CENTRAL. JOBS AND TING. DEVELOP TO THOSE AREAS THIS PLAN DOESN'T ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED ANY OF THESE ISSUES. AND IT ISN'T. BEING EXECUTED IN A WAY THAT IS MEANINGFUL AND IS TRUE TO WHAT THE VOTERS ASKED TO DO. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE CALIFORNIANS DON'T FOR THIS PROJECT AND WE SHOULD NOT. TO OPERATE IT THE WAY IT IS GOING AND FOR THIS REASON TO ASK FOR THE- THANK. OKAY YOUR. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT JUST FOR US TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT A UNIQUE MOMENT THIS IS IN THE LEGISLATURE A MOMENT WHEN BOTH DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN MEMBERS WHEN MEMBERS FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. MEMBERS ARE SUPPORTED BY HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT IN MEMBERS THAT ARE OPPOSED TO THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT ARE UNITED RIGHT NOW AND ASK FOR ONE THING. WHICH IS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE BE GIVEN. THE TO EXERCISE ITS RESPONSIBILITY. BODY TO HAVE OVERSIGHT. OVER WHAT IS THE LARGEST INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT IN THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA. NOT DOUBT HE- ARE ASKING FOR THAT BUT THAT WE ARE DEMANDING THAT THROUGH THIS RESOLUTION THAT WE FOR FILL OUR DO. TO WRAP. WAYS IS OF EACH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. AND THEIR NEEDS AND DESIRES AND HOPES FOR THIS PROJECT THAT WE TAKE A MOMENT TO. EXPAND THAT A PUBLIC AGENCY. LISTEN TO OUR CONCERNS AND ADDRESS THEM FULLY AND COMPREHENSIVELY. THAT WE NOW TAKE A PAUSE TO LOOK AT THIS PROJECT. WHICH STARTED SO MANY YEARS AGO TO SAY BE MOVING FORWARD WITH IT IN RESPONSE MANNER HOW WE CONSIDERED. WHAT HAS CHANGED STATE AND WHAT CHANGE WITH REGARD TO THE FINANCING OF THIS PROJECT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY DOLLAR THAT. IS SPENT IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVE MOVING FORWARD. AND INCORPORATING THAT INTO THIS PROJECT MEMBERS MAKE NO MISTAKE I REMAIN A SUPPORTER OF THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT BUT I HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THIS PROJECT. BEING ROLLED OUT IN THE STATE I HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS THAT WE ARE GOING TO CREATE. STRANDED ASSETS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STATE BUT DOESN'T OF WHAT'S PROP. TO THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LESS. UNITIES BUT THAT TRAIN IS PASSING THROUGH WE HAVE PROMISED THE CENTRAL VALLEY ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THEIR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS PROJECT. THEY WILL NOT HAVE THAT IF THIS PROJECTIS NOT COMPLETE IT INTO OUR POPULATION CENTERS IN THE BAY AREA AND LOS ANGELES REGION. IF THIS PROJECT REMAINS. ONLY GOES FROM OUR SIDE OF BAKERSFIELD TO MERCED. THAT VALLEY IT'S NOT GOING TO GET WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN PROMISED IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES OR CLEANER AIR OR RELIABLE IN THE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION THROUGHOUT THEIR REGION. I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT IF WE CONTINUE THE PATH OF THIS PROJECT IT WILL NEVER BE COMPLETED AND I SAY THAT AS SOMEONE WHO SUPPORTS THE PROJECT AND WANTS TO SEE IT DONE IN A LIFETIME. SO WITH. URGE YOU TO HAVE AN AYE VOTE ON HR NINETY SEVEN SO THAT WE CAN. MAKE SURE THAT WE DELIVER THE PROMISED TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN MISTER KILEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER. I'D LIKE TO THANK GOD THE AUTHOR AND TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE CHAIR FOR OFFERING THIS RESOLUTION I'M HAPPY TO BE A CO AUTHOR AND WHAT I. REALLY APPRECIATE IS THAT IT'S DIFFICULT HE SAYS THE BUDGET. NEEDS TO CONSIDER FALL OFF BECAUSE PERHAPS. THE BIGGEST. FOR CLOSE TO THE CONSIDERATION OF ALTERNATIVES BEYOND THE UNFATHOMABLE ACTUAL COST IN THE PARTICULARLY ACUTE OPPORTUNITY COSTS NOT HAVE THIS MASSIVE DEFICIT IS IT HAS TIED US TO ONE PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY. I HAPPEN TO THINK THAT THE FUTURE OF. TRANSPORTATION IN A VERY EXCITING I MEAN LOOKING AT A COUPLE OF THE ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE OUT THERE YOU HAVE PRIVATELY FUNDED HYPERLOOP COMPANIES THAT REYES. IN THE- YOUR IS IT IS THAT PLAN TO ADAPT THEIR CITIES IN THE ROW IN THEIR HIGH TO THE MATH DOT ABOUT CONDOMS VEHICLES BUT WE HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN DOING THAT WORK SO MUCH OF OUR ATTENTION FINANCE AND HAS BEEN ON TRYING TO KEEP MOVING SB RIGHT. IN THAT FUTURE OF TRANSPORTATION HOW WE CAN ALLOW CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE BEST VERSION OF TOMORROW'S TECHNOLOGY I INSTEAD OF THE WORST VERSION OF YESTERDAY'S. THANK YOU MISTER CREDIT PATTERSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK MEDI SPEAKER- MEMBERS. WOW. WE TOGETHER HAVE COME A LONG WAY. UP I REPRESENTS CENTRAL CALIFORNIA FRESNO AND PARTICULARLY THE MAYOR FOR EIGHT YEARS WE HAVE BEEN RIPPED UP. AND WE HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF. RIPPED UP BY A CITY AND A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT THAT HAS CLOSE BUSINESSES CLOSED STREETS THAT HAS PUT UP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF HIGH SPEED RAIL CONCRETE- BUT DOESN'T HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR THE MONEY THE EVEN. ON BRAINS ALL THE VERY TRACKS WE HAVE BEEN THE WITNESS. OF PROMISES THAT HAVE BEEN BROKEN. DOZENS AND DOZENS OF FARMERS HAVE BEEN HAD THEIR PROPERTY TAKEN AND RIPPED UP AND THEY HAVE YET TO BE PAID. THERE IS ONGOING LITIGATION RIGHT NOW BY WOMEN OWNED MINORITY OWNED COMPANIES THAT SAID. THERE'S A PROMISE HERE WE'RE GOING TO ORGANIZE OUR PARTICULAR COMPANY. THEY GOT CONTRACTS THEY WERE PUT. OUT OF BUSINESS AND BROKEN. THERE IS LITIGATION RIGHT NOW WITH WITH THAT PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL SHE'S OST HER HOME ENTER BUSINESS. I JUST NEED TODAY. AN URGENT EMAIL FROM THE FRESNO RESCUE MISSION. SAYING JIM PLEASE CAN THE LEGISLATURE CAN YOU AND OTHERS INTERVENE FOR US. THEY TOOK OUR PROPERTY THEY PROMISED US THAT WE WOULD BE PAID TO RE LOCATE AND TO COMPLETE OUR CAMPUS THEY HAVE RENEGED ON THAT PROMISE. HIGH SPEED RAIL HAS BEEN SO RECKLESS. THAT AS EARLY AS TWENTY EIGHTEEN. ON THE RECORD IN DEPOSITIONS AND COURT IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WHERE FBI AGENTS INTERVIEWED INDIVIDUALS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PART OF HIGH SPEED RAIL. WE NOW HAVE A VERY CONCERNED AND WORRIED FEDERAL OVERSIGHT THAT IS LOOKING AT HIGH SPEED RAIL RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE BEEN. AND WE HAVE BEEN RIPPED UP. AND SO I'M HERE IN SUPPORT. A LONG OVERDUE EFFORT BY THIS LEGISLATURE TO SAY WHOA WHOA WAIT A MINUTE. MAY BE THE ODD- OF THE CAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOUND SOME THINGS THAT WERE REALLY IMPORTANT AND SHE DID IT WAS ADAPTING OUGHT. MEMBERS WE HAVE TO BE MADE WHOLE. IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO HAVE A RUMP RAILROAD. BETWEEN BAKER SPEED AND MAYBE MADERA OR MERCED. THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HIGH SPEED TRAINS ON IT. IT IS NOT WHAT WE WERE PROMISED. AND SO THANK YOU FOR THE RESOLUTION I THANK YOU FOR THE COMMITMENT HERE TO HOLD A HIGH SPEED RAIL ACCOUNTABLE. AND LET'S ALSO NOT ONLY HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT THEY DO BUT LET'S HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE FOR HOW THEY- DO IT. THEY ARE NOT A ROGUE AGENCY ALTHOUGH THEY LIKE TO ACT LIKE IT. THEY HAVE MADE UP THIS PROJECT AS THEY WENT ALONG. EVERY ITERATION OF THEIR BUSINESS PLAN HAS BEEN ESSENTIALLY A BUNCH OF PROMISES AND THE NEXT BUSINESS PLAN YOU SEE IS ANOTHER TURN ANOTHER CURB ANOTHER CHANGE ANOTHER. A DIFFERENT APPROACH TO IT. AND SO THANK YOU FOR. THIS BIPARTISAN AND I THINK VERY STRONG MESSAGE TO HIGH SPEED RAIL YOU DO US A FAVOR IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AND MAYBE YOU HELP. TO PUT IT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN. AND TO GET THOSE PAID PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PROMISED PAYMENTS FOR THEIR PROPERTY THEIR BUSINESSES.

THANK YOU MEDI SPEAKER I I'D THE CHORUS IN SUPPORTING THIS HOUSE RESOLUTION- AS A CO AUTHOR BUT AS A VOICE AND THERE ARE DIVERSE VOICES SPEAKING ABOUT HIS REASON ONE IS IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE CODE BRAND EVER. AGING INSIDE INVESTMENT AS MY COLLEAGUE MUST MOST SIX OF THE QUIRKS PROJECT IN CALIFORNIA. IT SOMETHING THAT WILL BE LOCKED IN FOR THREE YEARS IF WE DON'T MAKE SURE WE DO IT RIGHT AND THAT IMPACTS. KIND INVESTMENTS DOT FOR TRANSPORTATION. YOU KNOW I HAVE A VERY RARE THE UTILIZED A RED BUTTON ON MY DESK. AND I LOOKED NEXT YEAR TO STAYING NO UNLOCKING A SET THIS PROJECT. MANY REASONS WHY IT DOES IT IT'S A LOT OF IT DOESN'T WORK BASICALLY ACROSS ANSWER. YEAH BUT THE NOW ONE IS ON OP CAUGHT A REAL PASSENGER RAIL PROJECT THAT MAKES SENSE HEREIN SACRAMENTO IN MY DISTRICT BETWEEN IN THE BAY AREA THE- DESPITE THAT THAT'S THE FASTEST HOUSE RAIL LINE IN THE COUNTRY THROUGH AMTRAK. ARE YOU THREE BILL MOVEMENTS WHICH WILL THE CAPACITY DE THE OPERA TO LINK THESE TWO ECONOMIES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT WE PUT ALL OUR MONEY INTO THIS BILL I THINK IN IN IN THE HIGH SPEED RAIL PLAN WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES NOT TO MENTION. THE METROLINK LINE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA NOT TO MENTION CALTRAIN BETWEEN SAN FRANCISCO. AND THAT PENINSULA IN THE BAY AREA SO THERE ARE MAJOR SEQUENCES AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE GET BEHIND SUPPORT HR NINETY SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MCCARTY MISTER OBERNOLTE OUR RECOGNITION. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF H. R. NINETY SEVEN AND I'M VERY PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS RESOLUTION I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY PROPRIA BUT THE LEGISLATURE STEP IN HERE. TAKE OVER OUR HISTORIC ROLE OF BEING A SEPARATE AND CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE WHAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH RUN THIS PROGRAM ESSENTIALLY SINCE CAPTION. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO STEP UP. THE EXERCISE SOME FISCAL OVERSIGHT OVER WHAT THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY IS DOING. IT'S VERY CLEAR TO ME. THAT FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS THE BUSINESS AND OF OUR SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY HAS PUT ON. IT WILL NOT THE TERMS OF PROPOSITION ONE A WHICH THE VOTERS APPROVED TO START THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM. SO I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE WE TAKE THIS PART. IRAQ THE PARTY TO SEIZE ACT MISSION OF. THAT THE- POSITION OUR PROPERTY UNTIL WE HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO EXAMINE THE UP PLAN OF THE AUTHORITY. AND ON THE LONG TERM PROSPECTS FOR THIS PROP WITH FOR. NOW STILL A POINT OUT AS VICE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. WE HAVE.
