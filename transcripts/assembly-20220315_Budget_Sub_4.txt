AS WELL AS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS TO FURTHER REDUCE THE STATE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE START THIS HEARING WITH THE TRAGIC SITUATION IN UKRAINE THAT RESULTED FROM RUSSIA'S MILITARY ASSAULT. AND THAT IS CURRENTLY ONGOING AS WE SPEAK. AS WE ENTER THE NINETEEN THE NINETEENTH THAT A DAY OF THIS VIOLENT CONFLICT GOVERNOR NEWSOM REQUESTED ON FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND. THAT THE SYSTEM'S RESTRICT. RIGHT ACCESS TO CALIFORNIA'S CAPITAL AND INVESTMENTS TO SEIZE THE PURCHASE OF ANY RUSSIAN DEBT. THE LEGISLATURE IS ALSO CONSIDERING LEGISLATION TO DIVEST STATE PUBLIC FUNDS FROM RUSSIA AND RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT ENTITIES A BI PARTISAN EFFORT. WHICH I HAVE JOINED AS A CO AUTHOR TODAY WE HAVE MEMBERS OF THE LEADERSHIP TEAM AT CALPERS AND CAL STIRS WHO WILL PROVIDE THE SUB COMMITTEE WITH AN UPDATE ON THE SYSTEM'S RESPONSES TO THE TO THE VARIOUS CALLS FOR. DIVESTMENT AS PART OF THE- THEIR PRESENTATION WE WILL REQUEST THAT THE SYSTEMS PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THEIR CURRENT INVESTMENT IN RUSSIA OR RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT AFFILIATED ENTITIES AN UPDATE ON RECENT ACTIONS THE SYSTEMS HAVE TAKEN AND AN UPDATE ON. FUTURE OR PENDING ACTIONS INCLUDING THE PAST TO LIQUIDATE CURRENT RUSSIAN HOLDINGS LET'S START WITH CALPERS FOR THIS UPDATES WEEK FOR THIS UPDATE WE ARE JOINED BY. MICHAEL COHEN CHIEF FINANCIAL CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AT CALPERS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IT'S A PLEASURE TO- TO JOIN YOU- AT YOUR BUDGET I HEARING I DID JUST WANT TO PROVIDE A- QUICK UPDATE TO THE RUSSIA ISSUE MY COMMENTS WELL- ECHO OR CEO MARK THE PROCESS COMMENT. AT JOINT HEARING THAT TOOK PLACE LAST WEEK- WE DO VIEW- THE RUSSIAN ISSUE AS- SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF THE OTHER DIVESTMENT BILLS THAT HAVE GONE THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE THAT YOU'LL SEE US OPPOSING. I IN THIS CASE- REGARDING RUSSIA- CALPERS NEVER OWNED ANY RUSSIAN DEBT- HOWEVER AS OF MARCH SECOND WE DID. OKAY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF RUSSIAN AFFILIATED- INVESTMENTS THAT THOSE TOTALS. ROUGHLY SIXTY SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ARE LAID OUT IN YOUR GENDER MATERIALS. AND BUT WE HAVE SEIZED ALL- ALL COMMITMENTS ARE REGARDING CAPITAL FLOWING INTO RUSSIA SINCE THAT THE INVASION BEGAN- THE TWO COMPONENTS OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE ONE- PASSIVE- SORT OF INDEX ORIENTED- THE STOCK MARKET- FUNDS WHICH TOTALED FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. AS OF MARCH SECOND AND THEN THE OTHER MAJOR- INVESTMENT WE HAVE IS A MALL. UP IN IN MOSCOW THAT WAS ABOUT A THREE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ALL OF THOSE VALUES- ARE OBVIOUSLY DECLINING AS THE INVASION CONTINUES IN UKRAINE AND- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS REALLY- IMPOSED SANCTIONS- THAT ARE- DEVALUING- RUSSIAN CURRENCY AND CLOSING OFF- AT THE RUSSIAN MARKETS TO- THE WESTERN WORLD'S- SO WITH THAT. I'M HAPPY TO OUT PASS IT ON TO OUR- MISTER AGENCY CHARACTERS- FOR SIMILAR UPDATER ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU LET SAYS THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION WE'RE GONNA BE JOINED BY CHRISTOPHER AILMAN THE CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AND JULIE UNDERWOOD CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CAL STIRS YOU MAY BEGIN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. I CALIFORNIA TEACHERS- WE HAD INVESTMENTS IN RUSSIA AS PART OF THE EMERGING MARKETS IN OUR EQUITY IN OUR FIXED INOME PORTFOLIO- BACK IN MID FEBRUARY THOSE ARE VALUED AT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS- OUR MANAGERS AND WE INTERNALLY TOOK ACTIONS TO SELL THAT DOWN. WE EVALUATE ALL OF OUR PORTFOLIO AGAINST ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE RISK AS WELL AS GEOPOLITICAL RISK. AND SO WE SOLD THOSE INVESTMENTS DOWN- TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS AS OF FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH. THE MARKET HASN'T OPENED IN RUSSIA I ESTIMATE NOW DUE TO THE DECLINE IN VALUES THOSE ARE PROBABLY WORTH LESS THAN A HUNDRED MILLION- WE FROZEN- THAT PORTFOLIO- WE'VE RESTRICTED RUSSIA AS AN INVESTMENT. IN IN THE FUTURE- MOVEMENT IN OUR PORTFOLIO- AND THE INDEX PROVIDERS THAT WE WORK WITH HAVE TAKEN RUSSIA OUT OF THAT INDEX- OF STOCKS LONGER CONSIDERED AN INVESTABLE MARKET. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION- AND- EXTRACT OUR CAPITAL AS WE CAN BUT RIGHT NOW WITH THE CAPITAL CONTROLS IN PLACE. IT'S GONNA BE A LONG TIME IS VERY LIMITED TO GET THE REST OF THAT MONEY OUT BUT IT IS NOT LIQUID HOLDINGS- IN STOCKS IN COMPANIES IN RUSSIA. AND ONE FIXED INCOME- BOND HOLDINGS IN RUSSIA. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN- JUST A QUESTION IF I HEARD CORRECTLY SO IT'S ONLY CAL STIRS THAT HAS INVESTMENTS IN RUSSIA RUSSIAN HOLDINGS. SAID ACCURATE. NO CALPERS DOES THIS WELL SORRY MICHAEL DO YOU WANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION SURE I THINK- THE DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTIC BETWEEN OUR TWO PORTFOLIOS IS REALLY ON THE RUSSIAN DEBT- WHICH CALPERS NEVER OWN- CAL STIRS AS YOU JUST HEARD I HAS BEEN SELLING THAT OFF- BUT WE DO HAVE- THROUGH THE INDEX FUNDS AND THE MALL I MENTIONED- WE DO HAVE RUSSIAN HOLDINGS I CALPERS. AND THANK YOU FOR THAT AND DID I HEAR CORRECTLY THAT YOU ARE MOVING TO A DIVERSE FROM THOSE HOLDINGS. WELL AT THIS POINT- DIVESTMENT REALLY IT'S IMPRACTICAL GIVEN- THE CLOSING OF THE RUSSIAN STOCK EXCHANGE AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL SANCTIONS SO OTHER THAN- THE INDEX FUNDS- THAT CHRIS MENTIONED- YOU KNOW WORD AND SIMILAR ONES THAT ARE AT CLOSING OFF- RUSSIAN. INVESTMENT GOING FORWARD- AT THIS POINT- WE'RE WATCHING- AND MONITORING BUT THERE'S NOT- IN THE MARKET TO BUY TO MAKE SUCH THAT. OKAY SO I GUESS THAT SORT OF ADDRESSES THE QUESTION THAT I HAD THE SYSTEMS HAVE NOTED SOME POTENTIAL CONSTRAINTS AND LIQUIDATING CURRENT RUSSIAN HOLDINGS. CITING SANCTIONS AND MARKET RESTRICTIONS. THAT IS A COULD YOU ELABORATE JUST A BIT ON THAT PLEASE BOTH THE BOTH OF THE- BOTH CALPERS AND CAL STIRS. MICHAEL YOU WANT TO JUMP IN YEAH GO AHEAD THANK YOU. SO AT THIS POINT I'M CHRIS HILLMAN CALIFORNIA TEACHERS AT THIS POINT THE RUSSIAN STOCK MARKET HAS NOT EVEN OPEN- SO THERE IS NO TRADING THERE IS NO VALUE ON THESE HOLDINGS IN SOME CASES- GROCERY STORE CHAIN THAT BANK- AND NICKEL PRODUCER- SO IN MANY CASES THERE'S JUST SIMPLY NO MARKET. TO LIQUIDATE YOUR HOLDINGS OR EVEN FIGURE OUT THE VALUE- WHEN THE RUSSIAN MARKET WAS OPEN THEY HAD FROZEN TRADING ON ANY FOREIGN ORDERS AND ONLY ALLOW DOMESTIC TRAINING TRADING THAT WAS- FRIDAY I THINK FEBRUARY. MISTAKE TWENTY FOURTH OR TWENTY FIFTH BUT SINCE THEN IT'S NOT BEEN OPENED SO THERE'S JUST- THE HOLDINGS THAT WE BOTH HAVE AT THIS POINT- BASICALLY FROZEN. WE LIQUIDATE THEM IF THERE WAS A MARKET THAT WOULD OPEN UP- BETTER PRESENT THERE THERE'S NOBODY TRADING ANYTHING ELABORATION I MISS YOU I GUESS SO THE MORE SIMPLE TERMS THERE'S NO WAY TO GET RUSSIA TO PAY OUT. ANY KIND OF INVESTMENT RIGHT I HAVEN'T THAT'S WHY I'M UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME. WELL WHAT WE OWN IS SECURITIES OF RUSSIAN COMPANIES- THE YOU CAN'T SELL THE STOCK BECAUSE- THE MARKET'S NOT OPEN- WE ONLY OWN ONE BOND THAT THAT WILL PROBABLY GOING TO FALL TODAY RUSSIA IS TO PAY INTEREST ON. THAT TODAY- THE POP GROUP. RUBLES IF THEY PASS AND- YOU CAN'T TRADE THEIR CURRENCY EITHER SO- ALL THE SECURITIES ARE JUST AT THAT POINT HELD- FROZEN. THANK YOU. MISTER COOPER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- GOOD SEE YOU GUYS AGAIN WE HAD A HEARING LAST WEEK A JOINT HEARING WITH- SENATE PERSON ASSEMBLY PERS- WE NOTIFIED SIX DEVELOPMENT BILLS OVER THE YEARS AND THEY'VE RESULTED IN ABSOLUTELY NOTHING CHANGING STATUS QUO RESOLUTELY DIFFERENT I KNOW THAT CALPERS HAS POINT. 8% INVESTMENTS IN FOR CAL STIRS ITS POINT 005% SO OVERALL NOT A LOT OF BIG INVESTMENTS CORRECT GERMAN. EXACTLY RIGHT SO IT SOME POINT I WAS THE- AND IF YOU'RE BOARD YOU GUYS ARE WORKING ON YOUR OWN SYSTEM THAT TOGETHER EVENTUALLY SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS. OBVIOUSLY LEGISLATION EVERY YEAR WE SEE FOUR FIVE BILLS ON THE VESTMENT WHETHER IT'S TURKEY- ARMENIA. RUSSIA CHINA. ISRAEL IT MEANS WE'VE A LOT MORE- COMING UP SO. IT'S FAR AS YOUR EXPERIENCE WHAT WORKS BEST THE LEGISLATURE PASSING LEGISLATION ON THIS- THE INTRODUCED HIMSELF CALPERS AND CAL STIRS WORKING ON BACKING OUT THOSE INVESTMENTS. THANK YOU AT ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER I WE DID FIND WILL LAST WEEK'S HEARING A VERY FRUITFUL AND THAT CERTAINLY- THE DISCUSSIONS WORTH- ANY MEMBERS GOING BACK AND WATCHING OUT WE DO YOU ENGAGING WITH COMPANIES AS MUCH MORE FRUITFUL THAN JUST DROPPING ALL OF OUR- OUR HOLDINGS OF A PARTICULAR COMPANY THAT. AS SOON AS WE SELL OFF. THEY'RE NOT GONNA CARE WHAT WE THINK HOWEVER PARTICULARLY IN THE FOSSIL FUEL ARENA I WE'VE- HAD VERY LARGE SUCCESSES THAT WE DISCUSSED LAST WEEK IN TERMS OF THAT. ENGAGING WITH- THOSE TYPE OF COMPANIES GETTING THEM ON A PATH TO NET ZERO OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DECADES AND SO THAT- IS THE PREFERRED PATH FOR CALPERS- AS OPPOSED TO A BLANKET DIVESTMENT THAT BEING SAD WE ARE CERTAIN KEY ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS THE LEGISLATURE CAN HELP- THE PENSION SYSTEMS. INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN SORT OF MORE- GREEN OPPORTUNITIES- GOING FORWARD SO I WERE HAVING FURTHER DISCUSSIONS INTERNALLY- AS A RESULT OF YOUR HEARING ANDI WILL CERTAINLY ACT SWING BACK- TO THE- LEGISLATURE. WENT WHEN WE HAVE SOME MORE CONCRETE- IDEAS IN TERMS OF HOW YOU CAN HELP. GET US TO WHERE WE WANT TO BE. ALL RIGHT MY NAME'S AGAIN CHRIS HILLMAN THANK YOU- CENTER COOPER FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AGAIN- THESE ARE TRUST FUNDS AND WE'RE BOTH VERY DILIGENT ON OUR BOARDS ARE HELD TO VERY HIGH FIDUCIARY STANDARDS TO MANAGE THESE TRUST FUNDS. WERE VERY AGGRESSIVE IN PAYING ATTENTION TO- AS I SAID BAYERN MENTAL SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE RISK. I UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATURE'S DESIRE TO EXPRESS LEGISLATIVE INTENT. CHALLENGE WE'VE SEEN IS THAT LAWS ARE SLOW TO BE ENACTED AND THEN SLOW TO CHANGE AND THESE FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE VERY FLUID. THANK COMPANIES AND COUNTRIES TO CHANGE BEHAVIOR OVER TIME WHICH MAKES IT TOUGH TO INTERACT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT LAW SO. NOT SURPRISING OUR PREFERENCE WOULD BE TO EXPRESS LEGISLATIVE INTENT BUT ALL OF OUR BOARDS TO BE HELD AT THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTY IN TO TAKE ACTION. LEGISLATURE REQUEST MANY NUMEROUS REPORTS FROM US WHICH WE WILL PROVIDE- DID SEVERAL TIMES. OVER AND TRY TO GIVE YOU INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PORTFOLIOS. SAID AND WHAT WE'RE DOING. DESIRING ABOUT SOCIAL CHANGE IS TOUGH BECAUSE WE'RE INVESTMENT PEOPLE WE HAVE TO SOLVE THIS MONTH FINANCIAL STANDPOINT. WITH THE FACT IT'S ACTUAL LAWS OR DIRECT WORKING LOTS ON COMPANIES THAT WILL BRING ABOUT THAT SOCIAL CHANGE. SO IT'S A COMPLICATED SITUATION I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT OUR PREFERENCE AND YOU'LL SEE THE BOARDS TAKE POSITIONS GENERALLY SADLY OPPOSING LEGISLATION. BECAUSE THE BOARD WANTED TO IT THEMSELVES. IN BIGGEST FOR ME IS WE HAVE IN PLACE IN THIS ROOM RIGHT NOW CALPERS AND CAL STIRS NOT FULLY FUNDED. AND HAVE BEEN FOR QUITE SOME TIME THEY'VE THEY'VE GOTTEN A LITTLE BIT BETTER THOUGH BUT- WE HAVE RETIREES AND KERN EMPLOYEES THAT ARE GUARANTEED A PENSION WHEN THEY RETIRE. AND IF FOR MUCKING AROUND WITH THIS THAT DOESN'T HELP THEM AN EXETER THE PENSION SYSTEMS ARE UNDERFUNDED RIGHT NOW FEE WE'RE DUE TO MEET ALL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO IT IT COULD NOT. BECAUSE NOT SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN THERE AND WE'VE LOST TENS OF BILLIONS THROUGH DIVESTMENT. OVER THE YEARS YOU KNOW JUST LIKE. CHARACTERS IT WILL AGAINST IN WHAT THAT. PEOPLE STILL BUY GUNS. SOME BILLS PICKED UP SOMEWHERE SO YOU KNOW AND I RIGHT NOW A LOT OF FOLKS ARE A BIG ON THE FOSSIL FUELS. AND THE MEDIAN AGE OF CAR CALIFORNIA'S FOURTEEN YEARS OLD SO WELL FOLKS ARE DRIVING CARS THAT DEPEND UPON GAS AND CAN FORTY V. STILL. I THINK GASOLINE IS HERE TO BE HERE FOR A WHILE. AND PRICES ARE HIGH FOR EVERYTHING SO. IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU NOW WE SEE PEOPLE MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE. YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO DO WITH FOSSIL FUELS BUT- THE ALTERNATIVE RIGHT NOW DOESN'T HELP. AND CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL MUSIC MOVE AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS BUT THE REALITY IS YOU CAN'T FLIP A SWITCH AND DO OVERNIGHT SO- JUST MY CONCERNS THANK YOU.

SO THIS IS THE VETERANS HOME MASTER PLANNED AND THEN OP FACILITY MASTER PLAN FOR EACH OF THE EIGHT PATRONS HOMES. IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO FOCUS THE EFFORTS OF OUR CURRENT GRAPHIC DESIGNER THREE POSITION- BUT NO LINE THAT WAS MORE CLOSELY WITH OUR OUTREACH DIVISIONS THAT WOULD KEEP PROVIDING CONTINUOUS OUTREACH TO. ALL VETERANS IN CALIFORNIA AND THE ONE POINT SIX MILLION VETERANS THAT WE SERVE. SO THAT WOULD INCLUDE- ADDITIONAL WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA TRANSITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. A LOT OF THAT WORK AND THOSE EFFORTS OF THAT UNIT DESIGNED TO CONNECT CURRENT SERVICE MEMBERS. AND TRANSITIONING SERVICE MEMBERS WITH THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY OF CARE AS WELL AS INFORM THEM OF THE BENEFITS AND SERVICES THAT CALVET CAN PROVIDE THEM. EITHER IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY AT THE STATE LEVEL OR AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW US TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH OUR DIVISIONS FOR WOMEN VETERANS AFFAIRS AND MINORITY VETERANS AFFAIRS. AS HAVE BEEN INCREASED THEIR OUTREACH EFFORTS TO- UNDERREPRESENTED VETERANS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FIFTY THOUSAND SIXTEEN OUR OUR GRAPHIC REQUEST FOR GRAPHIC DESIGN SUPPORT HAVE INCREASED BY ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT. SO THERE'S ABSOLUTELY A NEED FOR US TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE OUTRAGE EFFORTS OF THE VARIOUS UNITS WITHIN CALVET SO THAT WE CAN REACH MORE VETERANS.

THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE IF THE ARE NO DOES CA ARE WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE PANELISTS ON ISSUE THREE. NOW WE ARE ON TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES ISSUE FOR WILL COVER WILL COVER CALLIE CHARS. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED CALIFORNIA LEADS US AN EMPLOYER INITIATIVE WHICH AIMS TO IMPROVE DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION AND STATE CIVIL SERVICE. LET'S BEGIN. WITH OUR FIRST. PANELISTS- JODY THE FABRIC THE FOB. ACTUALLY IT'LL BE A TOUGH RIGHT BERMAN OF FINANCE PROVIDING A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL. YOUR QUESTION FOR YOU- REQUEST INCLUDES SEVEN POINT SIX NINE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION ONGOING FORTY THREE POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CALIFORNIA PIZZA DELICIOUS. SO SPECIFIC EFFORTS TO BE ADDRESSED INCLUDED ON THIS HIRING INCREASED RESOURCES FOR DATA ANALYSIS IN CALGARY'S UPS UPDATES INSTEAD OF EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY ACADEMY IN THE STATE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM ANY STATEWIDE EMPLOYEE GET HER PROGRAM AND DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION STRATEGIC PLAN. THAT WILL HELP CHILDREN'S EFFORTS TO INCREASE EQUITY INCLUSION. STATE OPERATIONS. ESTABLISHED THE FIRST MULTI YEAR PRO IMPLEMENT CAL THE TONIGHT SHOW. ARE WORKERS AND YOU HAVE CHAIR HAPPY TO ANSWER THE COMMITTEE'S ON THIS PROPOSAL THIS TIME. LOL HI THIS IS NICK SCHROEDER FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- BE AGENDA INCLUDES OUR ANALYSIS FOR PROPOSAL POSSIBLE NOT GOING TO TOO MUCH DETAIL ABOUT IT WE DON'T RAISE ANY OBJECTIONS PROPOSAL BUT WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE- PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AS THE ADMINISTRATION DEVELOPS IT'S- DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION ALL SINGLE WORD. THANK YOU I YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA LEADS AS AN EMPLOYER SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY GREAT INITIATIVE ESPECIALLY WITH THE GOALS TO IMPROVE DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION. BUT AS WE HAVE DISCOVERED IN SEVERAL HEARINGS PROP TWO OH NINE OFTEN GETS IN THE WAY OF US TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS. HOW HOW WILL THIS BE IMPLEMENTED GIVEN. THOSE RESTRICTIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- PROPOSITION TWO NINE PROVIDES THAT THE STATE NOT USUALLY EVEN IF YOU CAN YOU PLEASE IDENTIFY YOURSELF I'M SORRY JUDY LIVE FAVORING THE DEPARTMENT PERSONAL ADMINISTRATION. GALLAGHER PROP TWO NINE PROVIDES THAT THE STATE CANNOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST OR GRANT PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT BASED ON A PROTECTED CATEGORY AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IT CENTERS AROUND PROMOTING D. E. R. AS YOU MENTIONED. FOR EXAMPLE- FOLLOWING THE CURRENT PRINCIPLES OF OUR MERIT BASED HIRING PROCESS WE CAN ALREADY FOCUS RECRUITMENT TO INCREASE DIVERSITY AMONG APPLICANT POOLS. WE CAN OFFER MENTORING WE CAN INSURE DIVERSE HIRING PANELS WE CAN INCREASE AWARENESS F UNCONSCIOUS BIAS. ALL OF THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE THINGS THAT WE KNOW WE CAN CURRENTLY DO TO INCREASE T. E. I. WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH PROP TO. SO THIS THESE ARE FORTY THREE POSITIONS AT APPROXIMATELY SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR TO IMPLEMENT ANONYMOUS HIRING TO AUTOMATICALLY REDACT INFO THAT COULD COST BIAS DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS ON GENDER AND RACIAL PAY EQUITY STATEWIDE THE QUESTION ON GENDER IS THAT OPTIONAL IN AN APPLICATION. THE COW WOULD HOW DO YOU COLLECT DATA ON WHAT. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT DATA THAT YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY LEGALLY ABLE TO ACQUIRE. YOU'RE RIGHT I BELIEVE THAT THOSE THINGS GENDER IN PARTICULAR I BELIEVE IS VOLUNTEER RIGHT NOW YOU WOULD HAVE TO VOLUNTEER THAT INFORMATION. SO WE DON'T HAVE A WAY TO REQUIRED PEOPLE TO REPORT THAT. SO I HOPE THAT YOU SEE THE CHALLENGE THAT WE ARE IN IN TERMS OF THE GOAL IS IMPRESSIVE AND REALLY GREAT RIGHT IMPROVING DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION. BUT HOW DO YOU DO THAT WHEN THERE ARE LAWS THAT ACTUALLY DO NOT ALLOW FOR YOU TO DO THAT. WHAT'S THE WORKAROUND. LIKE I SAID WE DO ASK PEOPLE TO VOLUNTARILY REPORT THIS INFORMATION AND WE DO FIND THAT THERE IS A HIGH INSTANCE OF PEOPLE WHO DO REPORT THIS AND SO WITH THE DATA THAT WE ARE ABLE TO COLLECT. USING THAT TO FORMULATE THE PROGRAMS AND THINGS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO ACHIEVE WITH THIS. SO IF YOU ARE ALREADY COLLECTING DATA ON A VOLUNTEER BASIS WHY DO YOU NEED SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO CONTINUE DOING SO. WELL WE'RE LOOKING TO COLLECT. A LOT OF DIFFERENT DATA AND WE'RE NEEDING DIFFERENT TYPES OF WAYS TO COLLECT IT WE NEED DIFFERENT TYPES OF WAYS TO ANALYZE IT WE NEED STAFF TO DO THOSE THINGS AND IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK TO DISSECT THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION IN SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS AND GIVE IT SO MANY DIFFERENT CONSIDERATIONS SO. WE DO NEED TO COME TO YOUR AND REQUEST THESE THINGS TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND THE THINGS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING TO REALLY BEGIN TO BE ABLE TO TAKE IT TO. THE NEXT LEVEL SO THAT IT'S REALLY MAKING AN IMPACT ON P. E. I. AND HOW WILL CAL H. R. MEASURE THE SUCCESS OF THE CALIFORNIA LEADS AS AN EMPLOYER INITIATIVE. WHAT ARE YOUR METRICS OF SUCCESS. WELL THE ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE LOOKING TO ESTABLISH IS BETTER REPORTING AND THROUGH THE BETTER REPORTING WE'RE HOPING THAT THAT TYPE OF DATA WILL SHOW. THAT THE INCREASED MEASURES ARE WORKING IN THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO APPLY THEM. BUT WHAT ARE THE METRICS SPECIFICALLY THERE WILL BE USED EFFECTIVENESS AND HOW WILL KELLY CHARGE AND IF I AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT. WELL THIS P. C. P. CONTAINS SEVERAL DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND SETTLED EACH ONE WILL HAVE DIFFERENT MEASURES- BUT- IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION RELATED TO A SPECIFIC ONE I WOULD BE HAPPY TO GO BACK AND GET YOU THE ANSWER FOR THAT AND GET BACK TO YOUR STAFF. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE- I APPRECIATE THE INTENT AND WHAT I'M LOOKING AT AND I THINK WITH THIS COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FORM AND BEING GOOD STEWARDS OF PUBLIC DOLLARS IT'S SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION EVERY YEAR TO IMPLEMENT A NEW PROGRAM WITH MAJOR COMPONENTS TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF. DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION AND I CAN ASSURE YOU I AM THE FIRST ONE TO WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT WHICH IS WHY I ASKED THE QUESTION A PROP TWO OH NINE WHICH CONTINUES TO BE A CHALLENGE AND SO IN BEING GOOD STEWARDS OF PUBLIC DOLLARS HOW DO WE- CREATE A PROGRAM. THAT LEGALLY YOU'RE ONLY ABLE TO ASK INVOLUNTARY VOLUNTARILY. FOR THE INFORMATION. WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE I GUESS IN MANY WAYS YOU CAN LOOK AT IT TO WHAT YOU'RE DOING NOW IF YOU HAVE X. NUMBER OF APPLICANTS HOW MANY OF THOSE ACTUALLY VOLUNTEER THAT DATA. WHAT IS THAT PERCENTAGE LOOK LIKE. I WOULD HAVE TO GET THE NUMBER FOR YOU I DO KNOW THAT IT IS ACTUALLY IT'S A GOOD RESPONSE AND LIKE I SAID I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK YOU WITH THE EXACT NUMBER BUT IT IS A GOOD RESPONSE CURRENTLY. AND- REALLY I THINK THE- IN ORDER TO REALLY GET STARTED ON THIS. HAVING THE DATA IS SOMETHING THAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO TO BE ABLE TO MOVE IT FORWARD SO. WE NEED TO REALLY KIND OF GET STARTED WITH THESE DIFFERENT MEANS AND WAYS TO. BUT THIS DATA BE ABLE TO ANALYZE IT. TO BE ABLE TO REPORT IT BACK TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE IF WHAT IT IS WE WANT TO DO WILL ACHIEVE THOSE THINGS. OKAY SO HERE'S HERE'S SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE BEFORE WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. I'D LIKE TO-KNOW HOW MANY APPLICANTS CALLIE CHAR CURRENTLY HAS HAD TO DATE WE CAN EVEN LOOK AT IT FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS. IN THE PAST WELL TWO YEARS THE MID PANDEMIC CAN BE CHALLENGING. SO LET'S FIGURE THAT OUT. BUT OUT OF THE OUT OF THE APPLICANTS HOW MANY HAVE BEEN HIRED QUESTION ONE. FOLLOWED BY OF THE APPLICANTS HOW MANY SUBMITTED THE VOLUNTARY- INFORMATION TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION. AND I WOULD YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IN THE IN THE POSITION OF DIVERSITY ALSO INCLUDE GENDER. AND SO I AM I ASSUME I AND- CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THAT THESE ARE THINGS THAT YOU'RE CURRENTLY ASKING IN THE APPLICATION. FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT DATA. MADAM CHAIR IF I COULD JUMP IN PER SECOND I THINK THERE'S SOME CONFUSION THAT THE DATA THAT'S COLLECTED- IS FROM A FORM THAT NEW HIRES FILL OUT NOT APPLICANTS IN ITS DATA THAT ARE COLLECTED BASED ON FEDERAL E. O. REQUIREMENTS- AND SO THE QUESTIONS ON THE FORM ARE BASED ON GENDER AND IT'S ONLY MALE OR FEMALE AND THEN THERE ARE MONEY RACE RACE AND ETHNIC- CATEGORIES THE EMPLOYEES MAY CHOOSE FROM. AMONG THE BECAUSE THE FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THAT THE STATE REPORT THIS INFORMATION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- WHAT THE WHAT IT STRUCTURES THAT EMPLOYEES ARE ASKED TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION- AND IT WILL EASE CHOOSE TO NOT PROVIDE THE INFORMATION WHICH IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT ABOUT 14% OF EMPLOYEES DO NOT PROVIDE THE INFORMATION- THEN THE MANAGEMENT WILL IDENTIFY VISUALLY WHAT THE EMPLOYEE IS GENDER AND RACE OR ETHNICITY IS FOR PURPOSES OF REPORTING TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. SO I THINK JUST ACCEPTABLE TO CONFUSION THIS DATA ARE NOT COLLECTED FOR APPLICANTS COLLECTED. FROM HIRED EMPLOYEES. OKAY SO I SOME FOR UPS THAT CAN YOU. CAN YOU GO BACK AND TELL ME AGAIN YOU SAID THAT THE EMPLOYER VISUALLY THEN MAKES ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL'S. GENDER RACE ETHNICITY. CORRECT BECAUSE THE FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THAT REPORT THE INFORMATION- THE WAY THAT IT'S A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO MICROPHONE PLEASE. I'M SURE I CAN- BASICALLY THE WAY THAT IT WORKS IS BECAUSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT REQUIRES THAT WE REPORT THIS INFORMATION- THE WAY CURRENTLY WORKS AS AN EMPLOYER ASKED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION BUT IF THEY DON'T. THE FORMER EXPLICITLY SAYS ON THE FORM THAT IF AN EMPLOYEE CHOOSES TO NOT PROVIDING INFORMATION THAT MANAGEMENT WILL VISUALLY IDENTIFY THEM IN OTHER WORDS MANAGEMENT WILL FILL OUT THE FORM FOR THE EMPLOYEE. IN THAT CASE THERE IS NO STATEWIDE GUIDANCE AS FAR AS HOW MANAGEMENT SHOULD DO THAT. AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK THERE COULD BE IMPROVEMENT FOR GOING FORWARD UNDER THIS D. I. PROPOSAL FOR THE ABOUT THE STATE GAME BY MANAGEMENT. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT HOW DO YOU IDENTIFY SOMEONE SIMPLICITY WITHOUT ACTUALLY ASKING THEM. YOU AGAIN THAT THIS IS A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT AND SO WE DO HAVE TO MEET THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED AND IT IS CURRENTLY A VISUAL IDENTIFICATION I BELIEVE THAT SOME. IT DEPARTMENTS WILL ASK THE PEOPLE. IF THE BOX WAS NOT CHECKED- GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO AGAIN IDENTIFY AND IF NOT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO VISUALLY IDENTIFY BEST THAT THEY CAN. MISTER COOPER THAT'S A LOT FORCES RECORDED YOUR VEHICLE STOP YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO YOU CAN ASK PEOPLE TO GUESS THEIR SEXUALITY WHAT RACE THEY ARE. ON ALL VEHICLE STOPS THIS IS TROUBLESOME. TO FIGURE THAT OUT DIFFICULT YEAH. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE OUR TO LAW ENFORCEMENT- COLLEAGUES ON THIS DIET I DIDN'T KNOW I'M KIND OF SHOCKED TO KNOW THAT MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO TAKE. TO MAKE A GUESSTIMATE. MUCH LIKE LAW ENFORCEMENT ON SOMEONE'S GENDER IDENTITY ETHNICITY AT CETERA. DO EMPLOYEES KNOW THAT THIS IS THERE ANY ANY- ON THE FORM IS THERE ANY KIND OF DISCLAIMER THE NOTIFIES A POTENTIAL EMPLOYEE THAT IF THEY DON'T FILL OUT THAT FEDERAL FORM THAT MANAGEMENT WILL ULTIMATELY. GAS YES THERE IS. OKAY WELL THIS HAS BEEN VERY ILLUMINATING CONVERSATION. AS A MATTER OF FACT AT THE. WE LOST WE LOST YOUR AUDIO. I'M SORRY THERE'S ALSO- AN AREA WHERE WE HAVE A- FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT FORM AND- WE EXPLAIN IN THAT SECTION WHY IT IS WE'RE GATHERING THE INFORMATION WHAT IT'S USED FOR BUT ALSO GO INTO DETAIL ABOUT THAT SELF IDENTIFICATION AND THE FACT THAT IF. PEOPLE DO NOT IDENTIFY THAT WILL HAVE TO VISUALLY IDENTIFY FOR THE. THANK YOU IN ONE FINAL QUESTION OUT WHAT ARE THE WHAT ARE OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE DIVERSITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION STRATEGIC PLAN- HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED BY THE TASK FORCE. I ACTUALLY AM NOT AWARE OF THOSE SPECIFICS WOULD HAVE TO- PROBABLY TAKEN TO THEN AGAIN GET BACK TO YOU. OKAY ZAGAT A LONG LIST OF THINGS TO GET BACK TO US ON BUT I APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP AS WE TRY TO FIGURE THIS BASS OUT. YEAH AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S A HUMAN RESOURCE NEED IN GENERAL SO A CHARACTER HAS AN INTEREST IN THIS. OVER ALL REGARDLESS OF. A TASK FORCE OR LEGISLATION THIS IS JUST PART OF MODERN HUMAN RESOURCES SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN ANY. AND I'LL JUST PUT THIS OUT THERE BUT IS THERE A SPECIFIC REASON AND I'M NOT SURE WHO CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION PERHAPS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS THERE A SPECIFIC REASON THAT THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE ON THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE DID NOT PUBLICLY RELEASED THE- RECOMMENDATIONS. BACKGROUND PART OF THE FINANCE. WHERE. OKAY WELL THEN SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF HOMEWORK TO DO I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THE RECOMMENDED WHAT THE FULL RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE DIVERSITY EQUITY EQUITY AND INCLUSION STRATEGIC PLAN HAVE BEEN IN AN EFFORT TO.

ARE ACTING GENERAL COUNSEL WHICH IS A RETIRED NORTON FORMERLY THE CHIEF COUNSEL OF DMB AND HE DID THE ROLE MAKING FOR THE ECONOMIST VEHICLE REGULATIONS SO HE'S QUITE ADEPT AT THESE COMPLEX ROLES WE ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF STAFF SUPPORT. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THEIR NATIONAL TEAM THAT HELPED CREATE THE RULES WHICH YOU SEE PA AND THAT'S AS AS CONTEMPLATED THE STATUTE THAT STAFF IS ACTUALLY WORKING VERY ACTIVELY IN SUPPORTING. THE BOARD FINALLY% YOU KNOW IT'S VERY UNIQUE BUT OUR BOARD AND SOME TO SOME DEGREE- ACTING AS STAFF THE BOARD. ATTRACTIVELY BROKEN GOING TO TREAT MEMBER SUBCOMMITTEES TO LOOK FOR AND IDENTIFY KEY ISSUES FOR MAKING AN TO HELP INFORM THAT WILL MAKING SO THAT WE CAN MOVE A LOT MORE QUICKLY I REALIZE THAT'S UNIQUE AWARE STARTING FROM SCRATCH AND REALLY TRYING TO. TO THIS- GET THESE THINGS RIGHT. THE BC S. FOR THIRTY FOUR WAS. WHAT SIXTY TIMELY TO A THE STAR FOOT WAS. JUST KNOWING WHAT THE CLIMATE IS STATE. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION YOU KNOW WE ARE ARE WE VISIONS THAT- WILL. WELL SO I'M WORKING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE TO BRING ON OUR KEY EXECUTIVE STAFF AND WITH THE ADDITION OF THAT EXECUTIVE STOCKS THAT EACH OF THE DIVISION LEAD SO WE HAVE A LEGAL AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND POLICY DIRECTOR POSITIONS BUT UP CLOSE OR IN THE PROCESS OF. REVIEWING APPLICATIONS FOR THOSE POSITIONS WHICH WE HOPE TO SOON HIRE IN THE NEXT MONTH OR TWO ONE SO KEEP THIS IS ARE HIRED AND WITH THE ADDITION OF THE HR LIAISON WE HOPE TO THEN BE ABLE TO MORE RAPIDLY HIGHER FOR ALL OF THE COURT.

WILL BEGIN TO THE EXPONENTIALLY WHEN I'M DONE WITH THE GOAL OF OUR THIRTY FOUR BY THE END OF THIS YEAR THIS CALENDAR YEAR ENDING AGAIN I EXPECT TO COME BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE WHICH UPDATED BCPS HOUSE WITHOUT A FIGURE OUT WHAT KEY STAFF AND WHAT CAN WE NEED BOTH. FOX SPORTS AND FUNCTION AS WELL AS AS WE TRANSITION SERVICES FROM FEES HOSTED MANAGED SERVICES DID YOU ASK INTO IN HOUSE SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE RECEIVE OUR HIRING OR FORTY OR DIRECT HIRING AUTHORITY AND PARTICIPANTE I WOULD EXPECT WE WOULD NEED SUBSTANTIVELY MORE STAFF TO SUPPORT THAT FUNCTION IN HOUSES RIGHT NOW IT'S CURRENTLY BEING MANAGED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. DOES THE AGENCY MORE TIME TO COMPLETE. THE ADOPTION OF PRIVACY REGULATIONS. SO AS I SAID IN MY- MY EARLIER REMARKS. WE HI INDICATED KERN WILL MAKE- CALENDAR. TO DOUBLE UP FROM. SEVENTEENTH BOARD MEETING AND BOARD VICE VERSA. SUPPORT OF THE BY BETWEEN. THE COMMISSION GATHER AND SUPPORTING- THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AGENCY. I DON'T THINK THE BORDERS TAKING A POSITION ON. WHETHER WE NEED ANY CHANGES TO THE TIMELINE OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT WE AS I SAID. PLANK HAVE DROPPED SCHOOLS INTO PLACE. FOR CAPITALS IN CHIU AND COMPLETE OUR WILL MAKING. BY Q. THREE Q. FOUR. I JUST I HAVE SOME. ABOUT YOU GUYS BEING YOUR DE IT'S JUST THERE'S A LOT OF ALL IN THE AIR GET IT GOING THERE LIKE I SAID. IN THE IN THE LEGISLATURE WITH A LOT OF OPENINGS THE STATE IS A LOT OF OPENINGS EVERYONE DOES IT IS TOUGH TO HIGHER THESE DAYS I THINK THAT. YOUR GOAL OF HURDLES FULTON GETTING ON BOARD BUT IN THE YEAR. MIGHT BE SOMEWHAT AMBITIOUS. I THINK THAT'S RIGHT IT IS INDEED AND DISHES. AND A BUSINESS PLAN. I WILL SAY THAT I. THE STAFF. NECESSARY FOR THE ROLE MAKING ARE NECESSARILY THE THIRTY FOR A LOT OF THOSE. THIRTY FOUR R. TO COMPLETELY. KEY FUNCTIONS LIKE. FOR EXAMPLE- THE- POLICY FOR EXAMPLE WRITING IBCP WHICH I HAD TO. LEARN TO DO. PROJECTS THIS YEAR- AND- AN INCLUDING I KEEP. KEEP OR- CHUNK ABOUT HEAD COUNT IS ALSO FOR PUBLIC AWARENESS FUNCTION. DISPATCHING DIRECTS US IN ADDITION TO RULE MAKING. AND ENFORCEMENT. TO REALLY HELP. CALIFORNIANS A DIVERSE SET OF CALIFORNIANS. I UNDERSTAND THIS COMPLICATED. ISSUES AROUND PRIVACY AND HOW TO MANAGE THEIR PRIVACY SECURITY. SO I HOPE. TO STAFF UP AND- SPENT A GOOD AMOUNT OF OUR EXPERT. HELPING DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS DIFFERENT CONSTITUENTS. KIND OF A DIVERSE SET OF- COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES. SO THAT PEOPLE. UNDERSTAND. OUR PRIVACY RIGHTS MUST CALIFORNIA. I MOST COME DON'T KNOW THESE RIGHT YOU GET A THANK YOU CAN. THANK YOU MISTER COOK. I THINK WHAT A WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY MR SOLTANI IS THAT THE BOARD HAS NOT TAKEN A POSITION TO ON WHETHER IT WILL MEET ITS DEADLINE WHICH PUTS YOU IN A VERY COMPLICATED SPACE AND SO IF THE BOARD IS NOT MAKING A DECISION. AND YOU DON'T MEET YOUR DEADLINE THEN YOU'RE ALSO VIOLATING THE LAW. SO DO YOU ACTUALLY NEED MORE TIME. SO TO CLARIFY THE BOARD HAS NOT TAKEN A POSITION AS TO WHETHER WE NEED TO FOR EXAMPLE EXTEND OUR DEADLINE- WHAT I HAVE SAID IN THE BOARD HAS SUPPORTED IS THAT OUR RULE MAKING PANEL PACKAGE WILL NOT BE COMPLETED WITH THAT ARE DEADLINE WHAT WE WILL NEXT ARE DEADLINE THAT'S WHAT I SAID AND I LOST FOR MEETINGS AND IN THE- SENATE ASSEMBLY BUDGET CARRYING ON THIS ISSUE. I'M MY UNDERSTANDING IS FOR EXAMPLE THE CALIFORNIA DOJ ALSO DID NOT MEET THEIR DEADLINES BUT FACE NO ISSUE NO LEGAL IMPLICATIONS FOR MISSING THAT DEADLINE NECESSARILY AND MY PLAN IS AS I SAID TO TRY TO PUT OUT THE BEST SIDE OF BULLS AS SOON AS WE CAN INCLUDING BY BEFORE THE DEADLINE PUTTING A VERY WELL- KIND OF RESEARCH AND- KIND OF- SET OF RULES THAT HAVE. SUBSTANTIAL STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND I'M SO THAT THOSE FIRST DRAFT RULES ARE CLOSE TO WHERE I WILL END UP AT. THE END OF THE L. A. L. PROCESS. DO KNOW WHY THE BOARD HAS NOT SCHEDULED. THEIR NEXT MEETING. IF THESE REGULATIONS ARE SET TO BE STATUTORY DUE BY JULY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. SO THE BOARD IN FACT AS IF THEY WERE PLANNING TO SCHEDULE UR NEXT MEETING- I WILL ANNOUNCE THAT THAT MEETING AT THE END OF THIS WEEK. AND WILL BE SCHEDULED FOR LATER THIS MONTH AND THE BOARD HAS ACTUALLY BEEN MEETING QUITE FREQUENTLY- OVER THAT OVER. THAT THIS YOU KNOW OVER THE COURSE OF ITS EXISTENCE OF BASED SENSE SUMMER OF LAST YEAR IT'S NOT SOMETHING LIKE SIX TIMES. AND RIGHT NOW THE FACT BOARD MEETINGS WORK I THINK COUNTERED COUNTERTERROR WE WILL MAKE THE CREATION OF THE RULES AS THOSE ARE BEING DONE IN SUBCOMMITTEE. SO THE SUBJECT MATTER SUBCOMMITTEES ARE WORKING ON THE SUBSTANTIVE ROLES AND THEN WE WILL SCHEDULE AS PART OF THE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS ADDITIONAL INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND EXPERTS AND THEN WE WILL SCHEDULE- BALANCE OF THE ADOPTING THAT WILL MAKING PACKAGING YOU TO A NUMBER OF BOARD MEETINGS WHERE THE BOARD TO REVIEW THE ACTUAL DRAFT. TEXT PRODUCED BY SOME. COMMITTEE IN CONJUNCTION WITH STOP. THANK YOU MISTER. YEAH I REALLY HAVE A OR QUESTION PER SE OTHER THAN SAY THAT THIS IS A CLEAR SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHEN- THE INITIATIVE PROCESS IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE CURRENT LEGISLATION. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE IN THIS VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION AS WE'RE ADDRESSING RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU MISTER LACKING I WOULD AGREE. OKAY WELL IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AND WE DON'T HAVE CERTAINTY AS TO WHEN THE NEXT BOARD MEETING WOULD BE OR- ACTUALLY IF. THE AGENCY WILL BE ABLE TO MEET ITS GOAL BY JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE SOME UNANSWERED QUESTIONS AT THE MOMENT THAT WE MAY HAVE TO RETURN TO. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN I WANT TO THANK THE PANELISTS FOR ISSUE NUMBER SIX. WE ARE NOW ON TO GAMBLING CONTROL COMMISSION ONTO THE GAMBLING CONTROL COMMISSION.

INFORMATION SECURITY REQUIREMENTS ADDRESS INCREASE WORKLOAD AND IMPLEMENTED ADDITIONAL EFFICIENCIES WITHIN THE COMMISSION. THE COMMISSION PROVIDED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO THE COMMITTEE REGARDING THE STATUS OF THE AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS HOWEVER IN QUICK SUMMARY THE COMMISSION WAS ISSUED FIVE FORMAL RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE STATE AUDITOR.

I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OKAY I'VE SEEN NOT JUST ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR ME CAN THE COMMISSION PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE STATUS OF THE IMPLANT OF IMPLEMENTING THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS YOU'D LIKE I CAN GO BY EACH RECOMMENDATION OR JUST GIVE US A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THOSE. A BRIEF SUMMARY WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU. WONDERFUL WE HAD- LIKE I SAID FIVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOUR OF WHICH WERE COMPLETED AND HAVE BEEN COMPLETED- THEY RANGE FROM ANYWHERE FROM- TRACKING LICENSING INFORMATION TO. IMPLEMENTING CHANGES IN OUR REGULATIONS TO- HAVE CONSISTENCY AND UNIFORMITY BUT THEN OUR LICENSE TYPES. AS WELL AS- FORMALIZING PROCEDURAL INFORMATION THE ONLY. RECOMMENDATION THAT IS CURRENTLY- ISSUED- BUT- ARSENAL INCOMPLETE WORK PARTIAL COMPLETION BY STATE AUDITOR IS RELATIVE TO OUR COST IMPIAN ALICE'S THE COMMISSION HAS DONE ALL THE WORK THAT IT NEEDS TO DO HOWEVER WE NEED ONE CHANGE TO GO THROUGH STATUTORY CHANGE. WHICH WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH- TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO HOPEFULLY SECURE THE POT LAST PIECE OF STATUTORY CHANGE THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO MARK THIS RECOMMENDATION COMPLETE. THE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS I JUST WANT TO SAY WE APPRECIATE YOUR BACKGROUND ON GAMBLING YOU GOT THOSE- CARS THOSE THOSE CARDS IN THE BACK. VERY VERY ON BRAND. THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL IF OF THAT COMPLETES OUR LAST- OUR LAST- ISSUE THANK YOU AGAIN TO ALL THE PANELISTS WERE GONNA NOW MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT. WE WILL BE ACCEPTING PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE HEARING ROOM AND ON THE PHONE. THE PHONE NUMBER TO CONNECT IS ON THE COMMITTEE WEBSITE AND SHOULD BE ALSO ON THE SCREEN IF YOU'RE WATCHING OVER THE INTERNET THE NUMBER IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN THE PUBLIC ACCESS CODE IS ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR FOUR SEVEN. AND APOLOGIES- WE ACTUALLY HAD A MISTER TO SYRIAN YOU HAD A COMMENT REGARDING ISSUE ONE APOLOGIES ON THAT BEFORE WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT OPERATOR ONE MOMENT NOT AT ALL MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR REMEMBERING- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. IF THIS IS THIS IS SOMEWHAT UNORTHODOX BECAUSE WE DON'T REALLY DISCUSS TOPICS ONCE THEY'VE PASSED THEIR TIME. OF THE HEARING BUT- SOME COMMENTS WERE MADE BY A COLLEAGUE OF MINE. WHO I RESPECT AND APPRECIATE VERY MUCH AND HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THAT I NEEDED FELT COMPELLED TO WANT TO CORRECT- IT OPINION WAS SAID DURING THE DURING THE DIVESTMENT CONVERSATION WE WERE HAVING THAT DIVESTMENTS DON'T WORK AND MULTIPLE DIFFERENT NATIONS WERE LISTED. SO FIRST AND FOREMOST THERE'S NEVER BEEN A DIVEST MEANT EFFORT. TOWARDS ARMENIA OR ISRAEL THERE'S BEEN A BDS MOVEMENT AT SOME LOCAL LEVELS AND AT THE PARTY LEVEL TOWARDS ISRAEL BUT- THAT'S NEVER MATERIALIZED INTO ANYTHING SUBSTANTIVE- IF ANYTHING ARMENIAN ISRAEL HAVE BOTH BEEN OPPRESSED. UP OVER THEIR HISTORY AND SO IT'S BEEN IMPORTANT FOR. STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE A SIZEABLE POPULATION OF BOTH ARMENIAN AMERICANS AS WELL AS JEWISH AMERICANS TO. ENSURE THAT THEIR HISTORY IN. EDUCATING ABOUT HISTORY CORRECTLY SO THAT IT DOESN'T REPEAT ITSELF- AND THIS WAR IS THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF JUST WHAT HAPPENED. TWO YEARS AGO WE SAW HOW AZERBAIJAN AND TURKEY ATTACKED ARMENIA. AND IT WAS THE FIRST YEAR OF A PANDEMIC UNDER A DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATION IN THE U. S. AND- YOUDID NOT HEAR MUCH ABOUT THAT WAR AS MUCH AS WE'RE HEARING NOW ABOUT UKRAINE. AND RUSSIA. OF AND PART OF IT IS BECAUSE- THERE'S GEOPOLITICAL AND OIL CONSIDERATION BUT ALSO WAS THE FIRST YEAR OF THE PANDEMIC. BUT BECAUSE OF THE WORLD'S INACTION IN THAT WAR. RUSSIA SAW AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE SAME THING NOW. AND IT'S TAKING A LONG TIME FOR IT TO DO WHAT IT'S DOING BECAUSE THERE'S GREATER AWARENESS AND WORK AGAINST THAT. AND BUT BUT UNFORTUNATELY MOST OF THE WORLD IS STILL STANDING IDLY BY WATCHING IT HAPPEN. AND SECOND AS WE'VE PROGRESSED IN CURRENT DAY WARFARE WE KNOW THAT. ECONOMICS AND FINANCES ARE THE BEST WAY OF CURTAILING HARM TO HUMAN LIFE SO WHEN YOU TAKE STEPS TO DAMAGE SOMEONE ECONOMICALLY YOU WILL. YOU WILL GET TO A PLACE WHERE- YOU THE HUMAN SUFFERING. STOPS THE BLEEDING STOPS AND SO I DO THINK THAT- A DIVESTMENT WORKS- IT CAN'T BE SOMETHING THAT'S DONE ON EVERY ISSUE BUT IT'S A GREAT FORM OF EXERCISE. TO ACTUALLY HELP STOP HARM. RAIDER HARM FROM HAPPENING AND IF THE DIVEST MONTHS WE'VE PASSED THE WE'VE HELPED PASS IN THE PAST. OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO WE PASSED THE DEBT FIRST ADVANCEMENT WITH THE SOUTH AFRICA AND IT HAD REMARKABLE IMPACTS. FOR THAT COUNTRY AND FOR. MANY PARTS OF AFRICA AS WELL- HAD IF WE ARE STRATEGIC. AND PRECISION ORIENTED AND THE STEPS WE TAKE WE ACTUALLY CAN HAVE THE VESTMENT BE A GREAT TOOL TO ADDRESS. A VERY DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES AND OTHER PLACES BECAUSE WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND WE HAVE THE THIRTEENTH LARGEST BUDGET IN THE WORLD AT THIS POINT. IRONICALLY RUSSIA'S FOURTEENTH AND SO WHEN WE IMPOSE OUR WILL FINANCIALLY ON SOMEBODY ELSE IT ACTUALLY IS REVERBERATED OVER THE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND IT HAS AN IMPACT SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS A COUNTER ARE ARE A STATEMENT MADE TO THAT OF THE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW WHAT OUR MIGHT IS AND WHAT WE CAN DO AS CALIFORNIA OF- IT EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT WE WERE STATE AND WE ARE ACTIONS. SHOULDN'T BE ON THE INTERNATIONAL FRONT BUT GIVEN THE POPULATIONS THAT WE'VE BENEFITED FROM. AS CONSTITUENTS AND RESIDENTS OF OUR STATE AND GIVEN OUR ECONOMIC MIGHT. I THINK THAT THOSE ARE TWO NORTON WORTHY- FACTORS THAT ALLOW US TO PLAY A ROLE IN THIS SO. MANAGER THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO AT LEAST THE SAVE THOSE COUPLE WORDS SO I THINK I GROUP MY COLLEAGUE ON THAT. OCCASION WHEN THE WHEN THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD GETS INVOLVED THAT'S GOOD IT'S A GOOD THING BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS ON THESE PASSED THE VESTMENTS IT HASN'T BEEN THE LIGHT. OF THE WORLD A LOT IT IS JUST CALIFORNIA EARLY PEOPLE DOING THAT AND- WE SAID THE PERSEVERING OF THE IT WAS THE- JOINT COMMITTEE. BETWEEN ASSEMBLY PERSON SENATE PERS. AND THE SIX INVESTMENTS HAVE HAD HAVE NOT WORKED SOUTH AFRICA'S DIFFERENT THE WORLD WAS ON THAT. SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS I AGREE WITH YOU. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT BUT- IT CAN'T BE CALIFORNIA ALONE AND RUSHED TO THE GOOD EXAMPLE YOU HAVE THE ENTIRE WORLD. SO CALIFORNIA MAY DO IT IN FIFTH LARGELY CONNIE BUT THAT SAME TIME. THERE'S SOME ISSUES WITH THAT. YOU KNOW IT WITH CALIFORNIA DOING IT BY ITSELF SO. TO ME IT'S MORE EFFECTIVE EVERYBODY COMES IN. AND WE HAVE FOUR FIVE DIVEST BILLS EVERY YEAR IN PERSON AND I'VE BEEN HERE EIGHT YEARS DEALING WITH THIS. AND LIKE FOR OVER A VARIETY OF REASONS SO. YOU KNOW A FEW THINGS HAVE CHANGED ABSOLUTELY I AGREE- IT'S ATROCIOUS WITHIN THESE FOLKS HAVE DONE. BUT ALSO THESE BIG PENSION SYSTEMS. CAN ALSO MOVE IT HAVE AN EFFECT ON THEIR OWN. IN GETTING US THERE VERSUS THE LEGISLATURE EVERY YEAR PUTTING A NEW BILL FORD WEIGHING IN ON IT. THE SYSTEMS ARE FULLY FUNDED YOU'VE GOT A PLACE AT WORK FOR YOURSELF THAT WORK FOR ME THAT WORKING IS BEING REQUESTED A CALIFORNIA. IS NOT FOR IT I'VE GOT THE MOST EMPLOYEES IN SACRAMENTO. GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES STATE CITY AND COUNTY I'VE GOT THE MOST RETIREES AND SECOND A COUNTY FOR STATE CITY AND COUNTY AND IT IS A- IT IS AN ISSUE WITH IT. WE KEEP SAYING FOSSIL FUELS. AND IS THIS ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER. IN THOSE PISTON SYSTEMS NEED TO BE HOLE. FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES THAT WORK RIGHT NOW AND RETIREES AND IT'S JUST LIKE SOME THE THINGS WE DIVESTED FROM. JUST BECAUSE WE DIVEST FROM. DOESN'T MEAN THE REST THE WORLD DIVEST FROM IT AND THE FOLKS FROM CALPERS AND CAL STIRS. REALLY GAVE A GREAT EXAMPLE IN THAT HEARING LAST WEEK THAT WAS MY COLLEAGUES TO THE BEEN THERE. TO HEAR THAT IT IT'S A BIG ISSUE SOMETHING WE DEALT WITH. ON A REGULAR BASIS SO. I HEAR YOU WHAT YOU'RE SAYING I'M NOT DISAGREEING WITH YOU I AGREE WITH YOU. IT'S HOW WE GO ABOUT IT HOW WE GET THERE. SO THAT'S BELIEF I DO AGREE WITH YOU. IT'S HOW WE GET THERE THAT'S BEEN THE DEVIL IN THE DETAILS TO GET THERE. BECAUSE IT IS NOT RIGHT BUT LIKE I SAID. CALIFORNIA MUST BE OUT FRONT. AND SOMETIMES ARE OUT FRONT TO THE DISMAY OF THEIR OWN CITIZENS. THAT'S WHAT THE COST. OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA SO HIGH. BY LINE IS MORRIS TO LIVE. THE GAS IN OUR CARS TO HAVE OUR UTILITIES IN FOR CELTIC COOK NOW DOWNTOWN IS FIFTEEN DOLLARS. THAT IS INSANE.

AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF MULTIPLE LOCAL AND STATEWIDE BLACK BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS. WE SENT A LETTER TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE REGARDING THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY PROTECTION AGENCY. AS STATED IN THE LETTER WE SUPPORT APPROVAL OF THE CPPA BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY WENTY THREE TO ALLOW THE AGENCY TO START UP. AND FULFILL THE- IMMEDIATE STATUTORY RESPONSIBILITIES WE ALSO URGE THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO APPROVE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO EXPAND THE AGENCY'S STATUTORY DEADLINE TO ADOPT PRIVACY REGULATIONS FROM JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND TO EXPAND PUTTING ESTONIA ENFORCEMENT DATE FROM JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. THIS WILL ALLOW THE AGENCY TO MEET THE STATUTORY MANDATORY- MANDATE AND MAINTAINED THE BULL'S OF PROP TWENTY FOUR. THE AGENCY HAS EXPRESSED CONCERNS THE LOADING TO LEGISLATIVE HELP HAVING KNOWLEDGE THEY WILL NOT MEET THE DELUXE THAT JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO DEADLINE BASED ON PREVIOUS AGENCY COMMENTS. SMALL DIVERSE BUSINESSES MAY FACE IRREPARABLE HARM IF THE AGENCY IS NOT ABLE TO DEVELOP REASONABLE AND PRACTICAL PRIVACY REGULATIONS. AT THE TIME LOCAL FOR THE STATUTORY DEADLINE OF JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE AGENCY HAS NOT CONDUCTED PRE RULEMAKING HEARING OUTREACH TO DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. FOLLOWING STANDARDIZED REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE PRIVACY REGULATION ON SMALL DIVERSE BUSINESSES THANK AND I DON'T THINK AMENITIES WRAP UP YOUR COMMENT. I GET THAT YOU WOULD APPROVE SOME TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SO THAT THE TIME FRAME CAN BE EXTENDED OUT TO JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT CALLER PLEASE. CONNECT COMMENT IS FROM LINE SEVENTY EIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS DANIEL MORRIS AND I AM THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE PAM FIRM BASED OUT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT THE NATIONAL REACH WHERE BLACK FEMALE OWNED FIRM WHO PROVIDES VIRTUAL ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT TO INCREASE OUR CLIENTS BOTTOM LINE. WITH IT BEING OVER TWO YEARS NOW SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN IT CONTINUES TO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON SMALL BLACK OWNED BUSINESSES LIKE MINE. ONE MAJOR FACTOR CONTINUES TO STICK OUT OF THE PRIMARY REASON I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO KEEP SERVING MY CLIENTS MY BUSINESS IS ONLINE PRESENCE. I PERSONALLY WATCH BUSINESSES ACROSS THE STATE FORCED TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS INCLUDING FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS OF MINE WE HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE TO CONTINUE OFFERING SERVICES ONLINE. HOWEVER IF THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY PROTECTION AGENCY PUSHES THEIR MAJOR PRIVACY REGULATIONS WITHOUT COMPLETE INPUT FROM THE VAST CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY WE COULD FACE ANOTHER DEVASTATING BLOW TO THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS. WITH THE PPA IS CURRENT TIMELINE TO COMPLETE THE ROLE MAKING BY JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TALE IF YOU HATE THE TO CREATE SUCH IMPORTANT REGULATION. OTHER SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS I ASK YOU TO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF THE CPPA IS THE REGULATORY DEADLINE ENFORCEMENT TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA TO STRENGTHEN CONSUMER PRIVACY WITH THE IMPACT. ON BUSINESSES IN MIND THANK YOU. OUR NEXT COMMENT WILL COME FROM LINE SEVENTY NINE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS MAUREEN MAHONEY ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER REPORTS ON COMMENTING ON THE CALIFORNIA PRIVACY PROTECTION AGENCY I'D LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE REQUEST TO EXTEND THE AGENCY'S STATUTORY DEADLINE TO ADOPT PRIVACY REGULATIONS- TO DELAY IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT WOULD INAPPROPRIATELY DENY CONSUMERS KEEP PRIVACY PROTECTIONS. TO WHICH THEY'RE ENTITLED FOR EXAMPLE PROPOSITION TWENTY FOUR TO CARRY EXPENSE CONSUMERS- PRODUCTIONS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON RULE MAKING TO GO INTO A FACT FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE DATA SECURITY REQUIREMENTS TO ALL THE PERSONAL INFORMATION COVERED BY THE MEASURE CLARIFIES THE BUSINESSES MUST ALLOW CONSUMERS TO OPT OUT OF THE SHARING OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION. AND IT COVERS INFORMATION THE COMMUTES TO ACCESS ONLINE ACCOUNT- BY THE PRO RATED ACTION IN THE EVENT OF A NEGLIGENT DATA BREACH CONSUMER SHOULD BE FORCED TO GIVE UP AS PROTECTIONS SIMPLY BECAUSE THE AGENCY WOULD NEED MORE TIME TO COMPLETE WILL MAKING PROCESS MOTHER ANY PLAYING OF COURSE IT WOULD DISPROPORTIONATELY BENEFIT BECAUSE COMPANIES PROPOSITION TWENTY FOUR DOUBLE THE THRESHOLD. FOR THE PRIVACYLOS ANGELES ALL BUSINESSES ARE EXEMPTED FROM MEASURE ENFORCEMENT DELAY WOULD FURTHER EXACERBATE THE IMBALANCE BETWEEN THE BIGGEST. AND SMALLEST BUSINESSES THANK YOU. THANK YOU MANAGER AT THIS TIME THEY'RE KNOWN FOR THEIR MINDS AND Q. THANK YOU MR PRATER- THAT GIVEN SAID THIS A BUDGET SUB FOR HEARING IS NOW CONCLUDED. GEN.
