TRY TO GET TO CLEAN THIS UP --

00:29:29.868 --> 00:29:31.302
SO MY QUESTION IS HOW CAN WE BE

00:29:31.369 --> 00:29:33.371
SURE THAT THIS NOW WAS GOING TO

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:34.772

00:29:36.374 --> 00:29:37.442
MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN --

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:38.643
THAT THIS IS GOING TO FIX THE

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:42.947
ISSUE THAT WAS LAST BILL.

00:29:43.014 --> 00:29:44.315
THERE HAS BEEN A FAIR AMOUNT OF

00:29:44.382 --> 00:29:46.484
DISCUSSION AT THIS POINT BETWEEN

00:29:46.551 --> 00:29:47.886
THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE --

00:29:47.952 --> 00:29:49.787
OF THE PHARMACIES PRESCRIBERS

00:29:49.854 --> 00:29:51.222
DISPENSERS AND THERE'S ALSO

00:29:51.289 --> 00:29:52.223
LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:53.491
ASSURES THAT --

00:29:53.558 --> 00:29:54.826
WHATEVER IS PUT TOGETHER IS

00:29:54.893 --> 00:29:56.027
GOING TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH

00:29:56.094 --> 00:29:57.028
FEDERAL AND STATE LAW SO WE

00:29:57.095 --> 00:29:58.296

00:29:58.363 --> 00:29:59.397
BILL IN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT

00:29:59.464 --> 00:29:59.898

THEIR DISCUSSED.

00:30:56.254 --> 00:30:57.822
THIS IS A VERY WELL MEANING

00:30:57.889 --> 00:30:59.123
PRIOR PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:00.091

00:31:00.158 --> 00:31:01.359

00:31:04.529 --> 00:31:05.263
NEEDS.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:06.898
THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE TODAY NOT

00:31:32.357 --> 00:31:33.424
THAT'S ON IT.

00:31:33.491 --> 00:31:34.192
