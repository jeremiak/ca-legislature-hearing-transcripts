OF CONVENING A ROBUST DIALOGUE UNTIMELY ENERGY ISSUES. HELP IDEATE AND OUR OPTIONS REACHING OUR STATE SCHOOLS. I'M INCREDIBLY THANKFUL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DURING THIS TIME OF TRAFFIC TRANSITION. OF HOW WE. USE ENERGY AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO SOURCE THAT. I WOULD NOT BE HERE I DON'T THINK. AND GENEROSITY OF SO MANY MENTORS AND- OVER THE YEARS BEGINNING WITH MY FIRST TEACHING.

I TO THE UNITED OF COURSE MY GOD DEGREE MECHANICAL. AND HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO SCHOOL IN UTAH AND WORK IN NEW YORK. FOR CALLING CALIFORNIA MY HOME FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES. THE BEGINNING OF MANAGER CAREER COINCIDED WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB TWENTY TWO. LANDMARK LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE POLICY. IN CALIFORNIA'S LEGISLATURE HAS ENACTED A MEMBER OF LOS BUT CONTINUED THE STATE'S TRADITIONAL SETTING UP AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS. IF I DECLINED BECAUSE THIS. FOR SOMEBODY JUST BEGINNING HIS CAREER FIFTEEN YEARS AGO THE VISION THAT CALIFORNIA. IS SLIDING INTO LEGAL GOING TO BE A PART OF. AND OPPORTUNITY AND PRIVILEGE TO WORK IN A NUMBER OF KEY ISSUES OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS. AND MOST RECENTLY SB ONE HUNDRED AS WELL AS THE- LIABILITY ISSUES. AS AS YOU KNOW THE SB ONE HUNDRED ESTABLISH THE STATE'S QUALITY TO SERVE. 100% A POLITICALLY TELLTALE BUT YOU KNOW COUNTRY SOURCE. I TWENTY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. OVER THE COURSE OF MY CAREER I LEARNED IN. OF A DELIBERATE AND PURSUE COME TO FOR. OPEN COMPASSION AND- THE NEW TO LISTEN TO AND CONSIDER WERE SET UP. COLLABORATION BUILT ON. TRANSPARENCY AND RESPECT. TWENTY MILLION IN LEARNING AND ENSURE THAT INTO. AND TAKEN ANALYSIS UNDERPINNED. DECISION MAKING. I THINK AT LEAST THAT THIS COULD ARE. TO MAKE GOOD POLICY AND I'M DEEPLY TO AND THAT THEY CONTINUE TO CUT MY WORK. I RECOGNIZE THAT THE MUCH NEEDED TRANSITION TO CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY WILL BE CHALLENGING AND REQUIRE DIFFICULT DECISIONS. TO ENSURE THAT NO CALIFORNIANS ARE LEFT BEHIND. AND ASSIGNED LEAD ON ENERGY LIABILITY ASSESSMENTS IN SB ONE HUNDRED. I WILL WORK DILIGENTLY TO INCLUDE PROCEDURAL EQUITY FOR ALL STAKEHOLDERS CONTINUE TO MODERNIZE THE DATA ANALYSIS MAX'S. AND ENSURE THAT THE ASSESSMENTS CONTINUE TO THE BLOG TO SUPPORT DECISION MAKING THAT IS ROBUST. AND ADDRESSES THE NEED FOR THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS. THANK YOU AGAIN SO MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. AND I'M LOOK FORWARD TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS. SURE THANK YOU VERY. I APPRECIATE THAT- I MISSED HOW OLD YOUR SON. THREE TO TWO TWO GOT IT- LET ME ARE ASK MADAM VICE CHAIR IF YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND START GIVEN THAT IT'S YOU AND ME AND- WE CAN WE CAN GET THIS DONE. THANK YOU YEAH THANK YOU. COMMISSIONER I'M GONNA MAKE SURE I'M SAYING YOUR NAME PROPERLY LINDA IS THAT CORRECT YEAH SECONDLY DEVELOPMENT THEY ARE NOW LIVING COMPLIMENTS YOU ON WHICH WHAT IS A VERY INSPIRING STORY COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY AND A BEING DYSLEXIC CERTAINLY- I HAVE A CERTAIN A COIN FOR THE FRANCE AND I THINK MY SON AT THE BEGINNING MIGHT HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH THAT BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS STILL HIDDEN. IN A FULL INTERRUPTS AND EDUCATION AND YOURS IS QUITE REMARKABLE FILL A KUDOS TO YOUR MOM AND ALL THE MOM SAID ALL OF US FOR MOM SAY YEA TO OUR SON SO. THAT THE THREE AWFUL WHICH WAS A VERY IMPRESSIVE AND THERE ARE- BIOGRAPHY RESUME IS THAT YOU HAVE ALL GREAT SUPPORT FROM THE INDUSTRY THAT YOU ARE. NEEDING TO WORK WITH AND NOT FOUND TO BE LIKE YOU'VE ALREADY DEVELOPED A PRETTY STRONG PARTNERSHIP THERE AND HAVING AN OPEN MIND AND BEING ON ENGAGED IN DISCUSSIONS ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO MEET THESE VERY ALL OF THEM DISHES SCHOOLS ARE NEEDED GOALS AS E LOOK AT CLIMATE CHANGE SO. LET ME JUMP INTO MY I'VE JUST HAD TWO QUESTIONS IN TWO AREAS. ONE IS THE ARM. THE ABILITY TO MEET THOSE TWENTY FOUR FIVE FOR. WITH THE PHONE THE I. BECAUSE I'VE BEEN MANAGE A TRIP THE SIZE OF OUR- THAT LACKED CITY. READ AND I'M WONDERING WE HAVE ANY REPORTS YET THAT GIVE US AN IDEA OF HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO POWER. YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ELECTRIC CAR CARS OR TRUCKS TRANSPORTATION- ARENA AND IT. THE IDEA THAT THAT COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHIN. WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE KIND OF A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WITHIN FOURTEEN. PLUS YEARS OF FULL IF YOU COULD. GIVE US SOME IDEA OF YOUR CONCERNS IN THAT AREA YOU'RE BOTH IN THAT AREA AND WHAT THE PATHWAY TO SUCCESS. NOW IT IS GOING TO BE AND IT WILL CERTAINLY AND PERHAPS NEED. MORE SUPPORT FROM YOUR LEGISLATORS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR DESPITE THE QUESTION SENATOR AND THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING MY MOM AS WELL THANK YOU CAN CRITICAL TOWARD. SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR QUESTION ON THE SB ONE HUNDRED AND OUT OF THIS AND I WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO. COMMENDED THE- COLLABORATION BETWEEN CARB USE TNCS THE ENVELOPING THE JOINT SUPPORT. IT WAS PUBLISHED EARLIER THIS YEAR AND WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE RECORD IS SENT TO YOUR OFFICE. SO WE DO HAVE- HIGH LEVEL AND NUMBERS ON YOU KNOW WHAT DISEASE ARE STILL QUITE MONTHS WOULD BE. AND YOU MENTIONED I WILL BE LOOKING AT TRIPLING AND POTENTIALLY EVEN QUADRUPLING. OF AGREED BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE OVER THE NEXT TWENTY FIVE YEARS. SO SOME OF THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THAT- ISN'T ON THE KEY TAKE AWAYS WE GOT FROM THEM WAS STICKING AGREE FEASIBLE- BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF EFFORT TO ENSURING THAT THE STEVEN THE GROUND HAPPENS. I WE LOOKED AT SOME OF THAT- OPPORTUNITIES TO DIE BUT COULD YOU PLEASE SOURCES AND- MODELING A SHORT BREAK OVER. AND THEN THE RESOURCE DIVERSE CITY IS THAT BETTING WHILE I'M DOWN YOU'D INCLUDING THE GEOGRAPHIC- I DIVERSE CITY HAVE BEEN PUTTING ENERGY. OPTION WITH OPTIONS AND AS WELL AS UNDERSTATEMENT. SO IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC- SPECIFIC THINGS YOU KNOW WE LOOKED AT- I'M. STATE THE IMPORTANCE OF. D. OVERALL OUR DATA STORAGE. AND BUT LOOKING AT ALL AT SIXTY TIME TO BUILD A CO MEANT ABOUT STORAGE. LOOKING AT ABOUT TRIPLING THE SIZE OF. AND DISORDER WIND SO TAKING ALL INTO. AS KNOW WHAT IT'S AN INCREDIBLE CHAO. TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE- WE GET THEIR- ARE THE I THINK YOU. NO WHICH OVER THE PRO. OF THE- THIS CALL. TAKING STEPS AND IT'S TO TALK. LEVEL AND HOW- GIGAWATT OF NEW ENERGY SOURCE. TO GET TO TWENTY AND I THINK THIS WILL COUNTY TO THAT UP. I'M AS WE GO. I'M LIKE I'M NOT SURE I'M CONVENE WE'RE GOING TO THE GOAL THAT I IT'S ITS IMPORTANT HAVE A GO AND THEN ELSEWHERE CLOSE AND CLOSER ON CERTAINLY THE- BILL WHO ARE THE F. IN THE IN THE- THE- PARTICULAR ARENA- LIKE YOURS. WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE GARDEN AS WERE APPROACH. I THINK SOME. BECAUSE OF WERE NOT. YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT GETTING THAT CLOSE IN FIVE YEARS SOME NEW DIRECTIVE NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED AND CERTAINLY SOME OF THAT BROUGHT BACK TO THIS LEGISLATURE. THE AREA THAT OF CONCERNING TO ME AND I'LL GIVE YOU JUST A QUICK BACKGROUND. I THINK IT WAS IN THE FORTIES OR THE FIFTIES I JUST HEARD MY PARENTS TALKING ABOU. THE FACT THAT EVERYBODY WAS LOOKING AT AN ALL ELECTRIC HOME THAT WAS KIND OF A BIG. A BIG THING IF YOU WERE. IN THAT AGE RANGE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BUY A HOME. AND MY PARENTS I THINK WE'RE APPROACHING THAT. AND DECIDED THAT OUT OF THE DIDN'T WALK OUT BECAUSE OF STUDIES THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME I'M ASSUMING BECAUSE OF THE STORIES I WAS HEARING. WAS THAT IT WAS GOING TO BE TOO EXPENSIVE SO THEY OPTED FOR GAS OR NATURAL GAS. SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON NOW WE'RE GOING TO TOTAL. DIFFERENT DIRECTION BECAUSE HOME BUILDERS I THINK WE'RE STARTING TO NOT REQUIRE THAT ARE PUT THAT IN MANY OF THEIR HOMES. THEY WEREN'T SELLING FOR THAT VERY REASON. FOR NOW WE'RE GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION GOING BACK TO ALL ELECTRICITY IN THE HOMES AND GETTING RID OF ALL THE NATURAL GAS. AND I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT THAT IF WE DO HAVE. BLACKOUTS WE DO HAVE. YOU KNOW THE DIFFICULTY OF REACHING THE GOAL BUILDING THE GREAT BIG ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE ALL THIS GOING TO BE DEPENDENT ON IT. IF WE ELIMINATE GAS COMPLETELY. OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN THEN IS THAT IS THAT A GOOD POLICY TO IMMEDIATELY BE SAYING WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW REMOVE THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME WITHOUT ANY REAL STUDY SHOWING US HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO NEED AND WHETHER WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THAT IN THE TIME THAT'S BEEN GIVEN THROUGH A VERY AS PIECE OF THE LEGISLATION. I THANK YOU AGAIN SENATOR ASKED THE BOARD FOR THE CLEAN PARKING QUESTION AND I JUST WANNA TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE. AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF THAT YOU KNOW AS AS WE LOOKED AT- OF SEVERAL PATHWAYS. FOR REACHING OUR CLIMATE GOALS. IT IS. IT IS KIND OF AGREED UPON- BROAD CONSENSUS NOT. TO HAVE AN IDEA OF ANALYTICAL WORK. ON THAT YEAH LIKE TO VACATION OF BUILDINGS. AND THE SPECIFICALLY DEFINITION AND COMMERCIAL AS WELL AS THE ELECTRIFICATION OF LIGHT DUTY. VEHICLES IS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE PATHWAY TO DECARBONIZING OUR ECONOMY. I'M SO AND AS YOU NOTED I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THANKS MOST OF THE- WORK THAT THE AGENCIES ARE COLLECTIVELY DOING- IS BASICALLY UNDERPINNED BY THAT ANALYSIS THAT THE EDUCATION. IS AN IMPORTANT PATHWAY. I DO ALSO NOTED IN A THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS WE NEED TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL AND MINDFUL ABOUT. YOU KNOW HOW DESPERATE THE CHANGE AND THE DEMAND PATTERNS. FOR EXAMPLE HOW MUCH OF THAT INCREASE BUT ALSO HOW MUCH OF THE- IMPACT DURING THE PEAK TIMES. PARTICULARLY ON THE GAS SIDE AS YOU INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRIFICATION. WHAT DOES THAT DO YOU- IN TERMS OF A GAS USAGE. BOTH BOTH ADDRESS SYSTEM LEVEL BUT ALSO AT A LOCAL LEVEL SO THESE ARE IMPORTANT QUESTIONS THAT ASK IF HE'S HE'S REALLY TRYING TO TACKLE THIS YEAR IN THE AYE PROCESS. UNIMPORTANT FUNCTION OF THE CC IS TO. ENSURE THAT WE HAVE AN UNDERPINNING ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNING FOR THE STATE AND OUT OF THE NECESSARY OPTIONS TO THINK THROUGH THIS GOAL BUCKLEY. SO IN THIS AYE BURKE- WE ARE LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS WERE BUILDING DECARBONIZATION. I'M AS WELL AS TRANSPORTATION AS WELL AS NATURAL GAS AS A WHOLE. LOOKING AT WHAT WHAT IS THE DIFFERENT- DEMAND FUTURES COULD LOOK LIKE AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN I'VE COME A COUPLE EXTEND POINT- AS WELL AS RELIABILITY STANDPOINT. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ARE ACTIVELY THINKING TO AND WHAT ABSOLUTELY MAKE SURE WE WORK WITH YOUR- OFFICE AND. AND KEEP YOU UPDATED ON I'M NOT ANNOUNCES. THANK YOU FOR THAT I THINK OF REAL IMPORT THAT. YOU DEEPER DE INTO ROOMS OF. HAVING NOT LEAVE FOR BACK ON. IN THE OF THE OF ARE NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THE ELECT. OF GOING TO BE RIGHT. A SO MANY SECTORS. SO I JUST THOUGHT THAT I TO YOU A CHILD. SHE'S ON THAT BOARD. TO LOSE OF THAT ON DURING SOME OF BLACK OUT THAT. I'VE SUFFERED THERE MY FAMILY SUFFERED OVER YEARS AND NOT BECAUSE IT WAS NEVER BECAUSE OF THE HUGE DEMAND. ON THE GRID AT THAT TIME IT WAS NOT DURING THE BE VERY WARM WEATHER THAT WAS WHEN. THEY WERE DIGGING NEW PIPES OR DEVELOPMENTS AND- ACTUALLY RAN INTO LINES UNDER THE- UNDER THE HIGHWAYS THAT CUT ELECTRICITY TO MY HOME. A COUPLE TIMES I DURING THE DEVELOP A LEGAL YEARS IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY WHERE I LIVE. AND WE HAD GAS GAS STOVE AND A GAS DRYER SIMPLE I COULD CONTINUE TO COOK. BY CANDLELIGHT AND I'LL CERTAINLY WASH A FEW CLOTHES AND PUT HIM IN A DRYER SO THAT MY KIDS HAVE SOMETHING TO WEAR THE NEXT DAY AND- THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE JUST YOU KNOW EVERYDAY. LITTLE THINGS THAT YOU A COMEDY BUT WHEN THERE'S NOT ANOTHER OPTION- THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE GOOD FOR. CALIFORNIANS AND CERTAINLY FOR FAMILIES. AND ALL OF US IN PARTICULAR SO- IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT. SOMETHING THAT THE FAIL SAFE- FOR THE ENERGY NEEDS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THAT. THANK YOU ARE BEGAN FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO THIS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO US. WELL YOU'RE GOING TO PLAY FOR US HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE SHOULD THE BATH AND CERTAINLY YOU'LL HAVE MY SUPPORT. AT THE- APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU MADAM VICE. TOM AND I APPRECIATE YOUR GETTING STARTED ON THOSE QUESTIONS I JUST WANT TO CHECK IN ON A COUPLE OF ITEMS BECAUSE I THINK I IT'S ALSO GOOD FOR THE PUBLIC TO GET TO HEAR SOME OF THIS- IN THIS FORUM- AND I KNOW. ABOUT YOUR EXTENSIVE HISTORY AND SERVICE AND SO- YOU OBVIOUSLY MORE THAN HIT THE GROUND RUNNING AS YOU. YOU WERE APPOINTED TO THIS ROLE. I WANTED TO CHECK IN ON OFF SHORE WIND POWER- AND JUST KIND OF GET YOUR- THOUGHTS ON. A FEW THINGS- WE ALL KNOW THAT IT HOLDS A GREAT DEAL OF PROMISES A TOOL TO HELP CALIFORNIA MEET ITS CLEAN ENERGY GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGETS. I KNOW THAT THE CEC'S BEEN HOLDING PROCEEDINGS ON THE BENEFITS AND THE BARRIERS OF DEVELOPMENT. I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU YOUR THOUGHTS ON-AS THE WORKSHOPS ARE CONCLUDED. ON THIS TOPIC WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE THE NEXT STEPS TO BE. AND DO YOU THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER. ESTABLISHING A ONE TOP STOP SHOP PERMITTING PROCESS FOR OFF SHORE WIND POWER SIMILAR TO WHAT THE COMMISSION NOW DOES. FOR THERMAL POWER PLANTS ARE JUST YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT OVERALL. YEAH AND AT THANK YOU- CHAIR AND I THINK I JUST WANNA- I START BY. TAKING A HIGH LEVEL VIEW ON JUST THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE OPTIONAL WIND. AND HAS DONE IT SENATORS BASED KIND OF RAISED AND THE DSP ONE HUNDRED. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE DIVERSE CITY OF RESOURCES AS WE MARCH TOWARDS A CLEAN ENERGY GOALS TWENTY FORTY FIVE. I WE WERE ABLE TO PUT IN ABOUT TEN GIGABYTES OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES BASED ON. WHAT WE THINK IS THAT IS A DECENT ESTIMATE AT TAKING THE CENTRAL COAST AND THAT AND ALL CORDS. IN TERMS OF THE AVAILABILITY AND ALL TEN GIGAWATTS OF OFFSHORE WIND WAS WAS TAKEN AT THE KEY RESOURCE STACK- IN OUR MODELING HOLDING TO. THE COMPLEMENTARY LOW CHANCE OF THE COMPLEMENTARY GENERATION PROFILE BUT IT HAD AS WELL AS CONTINUING COST DECLINES. SO I THINK IT IS ONE OF THE OTHERS OPTION WOULDN'T HAVE AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY. TO BE A PART OF OUR SOLUTION AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN ENSURING. THAT WE NEED TO TWENTY FORTY FIVE GOALS OF A ZERO CARBON. RESOURCES TO BE- IN. OF PERMITTING AND THE BROADER CONGRESS- AT. ACTUALLY AT THIS IS JUST SOMETHING THAT I DO KNOW NEED FOR TO COME. I LED BY COMING DOUGLAS. AND I HAVE BEEN- ACCORDING TO. NOT BECOME AWARE OF SOME THE- CONGRESS GOING ON AT THE BILL CITY HIGH. ABOUT KNOCKING THE AT TO. IN DE PASSED TO HER UNDERSTAND. AND THINKING ON THE SUBJECT. SO I WOULD LIKE TO AS REQUEST PERMISSION TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ABOUT. I ON ON BECAUSE- I THINK FROM MY PURSE. I THINK OPTION BUT HE IMPORTANT I THINK HAVING STREAMLINED PROCESS THESE IN ENSURING. THAT OFFSHORE WIND HAS A TIMELY. AFTER MEETING AS WELL AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME THE RESOURCE ACTIVITIES INCREDIBLY. IMPORTANT LOOKING FORWARD. THANK YOU HI APPRECIATE THAT AND I CERTAINLY COULD FALL UP. COMMISSIONER DOUGLAS IS. OUR AND I SHOULD PROBABLY LOOK BACK AND SEE WHAT YOU ARE LEAD COMMISSIONER ON ICY- BECAUSE I MOSTLY HAD- SOME GENERAL QUESTIONS I WANTED TO. I WANTED TO ASK YOU IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON IT AGAIN IF IT'S IF YOU'RE NOT THE LEAD ON THIS BUT IF YOU WHATEVER YOU ADD I APPRECIATE. THE ELECTRIC PROGRAM INVESTMENT CHARGE ARE EPIC PROGRAM AS WE CALL IT. I WANTED TO- YOU KNOW WE STRONGLY SUPPORT INVESTMENTS IN ENERGY RESEARCH CERTAINLY. ARE TO CLEAN OUR ARE GREETED REDUCE CONSUMER COSTS BUT IT SEEMS A FEW IN THE LEGISLATURE ARE EVER WELL THAT IT SEEMS THAT FEW OF US ARE AWARE OF THE PROGRAM. AND ITS BENEFITS A SO I WONDERED IF YOU HAD ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING SPENT. ON ARE THEY SAVING RATEPAYERS MONEY AND DELIVERING ON CLEAN ENERGY. AND FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THIS THE PROGRAM DOLLARS INVESTED ARE THERE NEW OR EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES JUST HOW LEVEL THOUGHTS ON THAT TO NOT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GET INTO THE- TO THE WEEDS. ACTUALLY AND- I THINK AGAIN I'M NOT BELIEVE. COMMISSIONER ON THIS ISSUE. PADGETT HKE SHIELD AND CAN COMMISSION MCALLISTER I NEED TO HAVE A PROGRAM FOR THE CC. BUT FROM MY VANTAGE POINT I THINK COMMITTEE THE R. AND D. FOR CLEAN ENERGY IS A LITTLE MORE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER I'M LOOKING FORWARD AB MARCHING TOWARDS THE TWENTY FORTY FIVE GOALS. ESPECIALLY THE SEARCH- IN IN AND CLEAN THE OPENING UP THE OPPORTUNITY OF DEMAND RESPONSE. DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES A LONG DURATION STORAGE ARE VITAL FOR THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA. FINALLY THINK THROUGH THE LIABILITY AS WELL AS ABORIGINAL TWENTY FORTY FIVE GOALS. IN MIND MY HIGH LEVEL UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROGRAM AND YOU KNOW FROM THE VANTAGE POINT AND JUST BEGINNING TO LEARN ABOUT. IS YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. INVEST IN SUCH IMPORTANT TECHNOLOGIES- THAT IF NOT FOR OUR SPECIES. I INVESTMENT AS IT GREW UP TO A PART OF THE PROCESS. YOU KNOW WE HAVEN'T. BUT TO IGNITE. HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH SOME OF THE- OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE SEE ON THE DEMAND RESPONSE EXAMPLE OF PIECE. INVESTMENT DEMENTIA. ABOUT MILLION GRANT TO ALBION NOW IS THE ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHICH BE IN THE- ACTUAL PROMISED AND I'M- THE- PASSED WITH THE SPECIFIC BENEFITS OF THE- I WOULD TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU DO PROVIDE SPECIFIC.

BOARD FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS- GREAT RELIABILITY IS STILL THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT THEY SUCCESS IN REACHING OR EXCEEDING OUR CALIFORNIA CLIMATE GOALS I'M PROUD THAT AS A BOARD WE HAVE WORKED HARD WITH STAFF FOCUSING ON SUMMER READING LIST FOR THAT LOAD SHEDDING ADVANCE IT'S OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY WE ARE WORKING WELL AND COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. AND OTHER STATE AND REGIONAL STAKEHOLDERS. AS A CALIFORNIA NATIVE IN MY FAMILY HAS BEEN HERE FOR OVER FIVE. GENERATIONS OUR ROOTS ARE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY MY GRANDMOTHER GREW UP ON A RANCH IN. IN FRESNO MY GRANDFATHER WAS A MEMBER OF THE PIONEERING FITS OUR FAMILY WHO HELPED. WHO HELPED CREATE AGRICULTURE IN AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. MY FAMILY HAS REALLY HELPED ME UNDERSTAND THE RICH HISTORY A VARIETY THE EXPERIENCES IN OUR GREAT STATE. AND MY FIRST YEARS OUT OF COLLEGE I SPENT IN SACRAMENTO IN THE CAPITAL WITH ASSEMBLY SPEAKER PRO TEM AND SOON TO BE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LIAM MCCARTHY. ALTHOUGH MY CAREER BEGAN AS SACRAMENTO IT TOOK ME TO WASHINGTON DC NINE TO LA WHERE I MET MY HUSBAND. ALAN ARKIN TOP WHO IS JOINING HERE TODAY ON SOON HE IS AN EDUCATOR AND FACULTY MEMBER OF THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. TOGETHER WE RAISED OUR TWO SONS JACOB AND MICHAEL WHO I HOPE WE'RE ALSO WATCHING TODAY BUT IT IS A WORK DAY FOR THEMSO I'M NOT SURE.

BUSINESS COUNSELING INSTITUTE WHERE I FOCUSED ON INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC OF ARNOLD AND ECONOMIC ISSUES FOR MANY YEARS. AT THE L. A. B. C. AND ALSO ON THE ICE AWARD I JUST TRIED TO DEMONSTRATE HOW ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE BIG DEEPY INTEGRATED. THANK YOU TO OUR ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS SOCIAL JUSTICE HEALTH AND WILL BE. SO IT'S MY PLEASURE TO BE WITH YOU TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO OUR DISCUSSION ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU MISS LESLIE MISSOURI GO RIGHT AHEAD. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL AFTER MARY'S INTERACTION I HAVE TO ADMIT MY HUSBAND. WENT FISHING SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE K. AT ANY RATE I DO A PRE. THIS TODAY TO BE HERE WITH YOU. TO TALK ABOUT MY PENDING CONFIRMATION TO THE ISO'S BOARD OF GOVERNORS. AS YOU HEARD FROM THE- FROM THE COMMISSIONERS- DISCUSSION. M. FROM MERRY IS COMMENTS DECARBONISING THE ENERGY SECTOR IT'S NOT JUST A STATE GOAL IT'S THE MANDATE SB ONE HUNDRED REQUIRES US TO GET TO. A 100% RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARD MEETING ALL OF OUR ELECTRIC ENERGY NEEDS. BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY IT'S THE ISO'S JOB TO PRESERVE RELIABLE ELECTRIC SERVICE WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT THE STATE CAN MEET THOSE CLIMATE GOALS. THE ISO IS PROVING THAT IT CAN BE DONE EACH AND EVERY DAY WE SEND A NEW RENEWABLE ENERGY USE RECORD OF OVER 90% IN APRIL SO WE ARE GETTING THERE WE'RE DOING. LAST SUMMER'S AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY HEAT STORM REMINDED US ALL OF THE CRITICAL ROLE ENERGY HAS IN OUR ECONOMY AND OUR DAILY LIVES. AND HOW IMPORTANT THE ISO'S RELIABILITY RESPONSIBILITY IS TO THE CITIZENS OF OUR STATE. I SPENT ALMOST THIRTY YEARS AT SMUD SACRAMENTO'S PUBLICLY OWNED ELECTRIC UTILITY THE FIRST FIFTEEN AS LAWYER AND THEN GENERAL COUNSEL. AND ALMOST FIFTEEN THEREAFTER AS THE CEO AND GENERAL MANAGER. AND I THEN SPENT. THE LAST TWELVE YEARS AS THE NORTH AMERICAN ELECTRIC RELIABILITY CORPORATION OR NETWORK. BOARD MEMBER WORKING ON BOTH GREAT RELIABILITY AND CYBERSECURITY I THINK I WILL BRING SOME REAL WORLD OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE TO THE BOARD AS WELL AS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE AS A BOARD MEMBER AND I DO WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. THE CHALLENGE IN MY VIEW THAT WE ARE FACING IS A BIG ONE I'D LIKE TO BE PART OF FIGURING OUT HOW WE CONTINUE TO MEET BOTH OF OUR BOTH OUR RELIABILITY AND OUR ENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES. THANK YOU AND I LOOK FOR YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH BYE AND- I WISH YOUR HUSBAND LOOK AND THE FISHING REGARD UNLESS HE'S JUST MEDITATING OUT THERE OF WHICH- I UNDERSTAND- I THINK THE VICE CHAIRMAN I WILL ASK SENATOR COM LONGER SHE WANTS TO START US OFF SAID SHE IS MULTI TASKING WITH TO COMMITTEES TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR I WILL- TRY TO KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING ABLE. TO MEET WITH THE TWO OF YOU ALL BUT I READ- YOUR APPLICATIONS AND RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS AND I AM. AM PRETTY CONFIDENT AND HOW TODAY IS GOING TO GO- AND IN GREAT AND GRATEFUL FOR- YOUR SERVICE IN THIS SPACE AND- A HEARTY HELLO TO MERRY LESLIE WHO COMES FROM LA AND- WE'VE WORKED IN THE PAST ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES SO. I LOVE WHEN WE HAVE REPRESENTATION FROM LA ON THESE VARIOUS COMMISSIONS- I AM GOING TO START WITH- COMMISSIONER STORY- DID I PRONOUNCE YOUR NAME CORRECTLY AND- YES I WAS LIKE SEASHORE CHAUDHRY PERFECTO- AND REALLY SORT OF CURIOUS AND WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU COULD SORT OF SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON ON. THE BUDGET ON- THE GRIT AND OUR GRID SECURITY AND WHAT YOU THINK ARE SOME OF THE GREATEST THREATS. ARM TO OUR GREAT SECURITY IN CALIFORNIA- AND ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT ARE GREAT COULD SUCCUMB TO. THREATS SIMILAR TO- THE COLONIAL PIPELINE. YES AND NO WHICH IS NOT A GREAT ANSWER BUT LET ME EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT FIRST I WILL SAY. OF IT IS DIFFERENT IN THAT THE ELECTRIC GRID IS OPERATED UNDER MANDATORY CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS BOTH PHYSICAL SECURITY CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION AS WELL AS CYBER SECURITY IT SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY ETCETERA THE GAS INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW DOES NOT HAVE ANY STANDARDS THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET AND THAT WAS PART OF THE CHALLENGE WITH WHAT HAPPENED WITH THAT PIPELINE FAILURE AND THERE'S A BIG ARGUMENT GOING ON RIGHT NOW ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT MAYBE THE GAS INDUSTRY NEEDS TO MOVE IN THE DIRECTION THE ELECTRIC SECTOR SO WE DO HAVE MORE PROTECTION. FOR THE GRIP. THEN THE GAS PIPELINE SYSTEM DOESN'T IN THE COUNTRY THE WORRYING THOUGHT THOUGH IS THAT WE DO HAVE A LOT OF RELIANCE ACROSS THE NATION. IN MEETING OUR ELECTRIC GRID MEANS WITH GAS PIPELINE SUPPLY SOURCES SO IT IS A BIG ISSUE. THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF. CHALLENGES I THINK ON THE CYBER FRONT COMING OFF OF THE NEW RECORD WASTE A LOT OF TIME WORKING ON THIS WEEK'S WE FOCUSED ON NATION STATE CHALLENGES AND THIS IS REALLY TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF STUFF THE STUFF MAYBE BEING CARRIED OUT BY RUSSIAN MY CHINA MY NORTH KOREA BY IRAN ALL THE COUNTRIES THAT MAYBE ACTUALLY ATTEMPTING TO HACK THE GRID AND TAKE IT DOWN FOR. ILLEGAL OR MILITARY REASONS. AND THEN THE SECOND ONE AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE REALLY STARTING TO SEE HAVE A LOOTING. GOING ON THIS YEAR IS RANSOMWARE. YOU HAVE PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS WHO JUST WANT THEIR CRIMINALS AND THEY YOU THINK ABOUT THE STATE HAS ALREADY TAKEN SOME GOOD STEPS AS COMMISSIONER- THE NEW JUST TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF HAVING A CENTRAL. FOCUS OFFICE TO TRY AND WORK ON THESE ISSUES. BUT I DO THINK IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT EVERY COMPANY HAVE BOTH GOOD TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS WHERE THEY'RE ATTEMPTING TO. STOP THE ASSAULTS THEY'RE COMING IN AS WELL AS TRAINING OF STAFF BECAUSE WE'RE DISCOVERING THAT A LOT OF THESE CHALLENGES ARE COMING IN. THROUGH EMAILS AND PHISHING ATTACKS AND- EMPLOYEES OPENING THINGS THAT THEY SHOULD BE OPENING SO I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT. MY LIMITED TIME SO FAR ON THE ISO BOARD. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE ISO ENGAGES IN THOSE ACTIVITIES I KNOW THAT THAT ALSO. IS THAT KIND OF TRAINING. THAT KIND OF- THE SECURITY SYSTEM SUPPORT IS BEING DONE BY ALL THE UTILITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE. MORE OR REGISTERED ENTITIES THAT ARE UNDER THE NETWORK MANDATORY CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS. SO IT MIGHT CONTENT TO SLEEP AT NIGHT KNOW EVERY MORNING I GET UP AND IT SEEMS TO ME WE'RE SEEING SOME NEW CHALLENGE THAT'S COME OUT. BECAUSE THIS IS AN EVOLVING AREA I DO THINK THE ELECTRIC SECTOR IS POSITION BETTER THAN THE GAS SECTOR RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU FOR THAT- INCREDIBLY INFORMATIVE AND SOBERING- I COMMISSIONER LESLIE I WANTED TO ASK YOU A QUESTION SINCE THIS IS A REAPPOINTMENT FOR YOU- IN AB E. YOU CAN SORT OF SHARED SOME OF WHAT YOU'VE EXPERIENCED- DURING YOUR TIME- AS A ARE ON THE BOARD. HOW DO YOU THINK THAT THE BOARD CAN SUPPORT BRINGING MORE STORAGE TECHNOLOGY ON TO THE GRADE WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN SO MANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF- ENERGY THAT ARE OUT HERE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PRODUCTS AND THE NEED TO SORT OF BUILD THAT UP SO YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW THE BOARD CAN SUPPORT- THAT KIND OF EXPANDING DIVERSITY. THANK YOU SENATOR AND ON LIKE HE SAID I'M PROUD TO BE FROM LOS ANGELES AND ONE OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS I BELIEVE HERE IN. IN US- LA MOM. I THINK IT'S AN EXCITING TIME FOR BATTERY STORAGE ON RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS ON THE GRID THAT WE'VE WE FULLY INTEGRATED- THANKS TO SOME REALLY GOOD INTERAGENCY PLANNING THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS THE CQC HAS COMMISSION THAT'S HEADING FOR US THE END OF THIS SUMMER I THINK WHAT IT MEANS IS THAT WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE CLOSER TO TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS. OF BATTERY STORAGE. ON THE GRID AND FOR US AND WITH OUR NET PEAK- POWER NEEDS FOR RELIABILITY IN THIS IS NOT A CRITICAL ISSUE THAT WHEN I CAME ON TO THE BOARD YOU KNOW THE OF THE. STOCK CURVE RATE IT SHOWS THAT YOU KNOW WE GOES OFF ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU NEED A LOT OF ENERGY SO. BATTERIES FOR US OR PLUS ABOUT STORAGE IS. IT WHAT'S GOING ALLOW US TO FLY AND THAT KERR. AND HAVE GREATER ROLE. SENATOR SO I CAN YOU'RE SEE A LOT MORE OF THAT AND I. AT THE PRIOR COMMISSIONER BEEN. EXPLAIN THIS IF YOU SEE- REQUIRED AN ADDITIONAL ELEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF ENERGY RESOURCE ADEQUACY THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE HELLO BE ADDITIONAL BATTERY STORAGE THERE AS WELL GREAT THANK YOU I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUES ON THE BOARD ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS SO- THESE WERE THE ONLY TWO THAT I. REALLY HAD I'M JUST EXCITED I THINK THIS IS ON- AN AMAZING SPACE AND THERE'S SO MUCH TO LEARN M. AND I THINK THE PLAYGROUND IS JUST YOU KNOW REALLY VIBRANT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CAN DO- AS A STATE- WITH DIVERSIFYING OUR ENERGY FIGURING OUT HOW TO. YOU KNOW GET MORE OF IT AND RETAIN IT MAKING GLUE GREENER CLEANER CHEAPER AND MORE ACCESSIBLE- AND I REALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE A VERY INTEGRAL PART OF THAT PUZZLE SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU SENATOR MEADOW VICE CHAIR YEAH. WELL THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU FOR STOP BEING SO WILLING TO SERVING HAN AND- YOU KNOW RENO THAT'S GOING TO BE TIME MORE AND MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT AS WE LOOK AT CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW WE'RE ADDRESSING AN AGENT HOPEFULLY A HOW WE'RE MANAGING IT IN AND DOING MUCH BETTER THAN WE THOUGHT WE WOULD DO. AS WE SIT HERE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE I THINK WE'LL START WITH M'S LESLIE AS A RETURNING MEMBER- AND ACTUALLY COMMEND YOU FOR THE WONDERFUL PRESENTATION YOU MADE YOU YOU APPROACH IT WITH SUCH A POSITIVE OUTLOOK. THAT'S GOOD VERY GOOD FOR THOSE OF US AND ME IN PARTICULAR NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH HOW IT ALL WORKS I'VE NEVER SERVED ON THE ENERGY OF COMMITTEES ARE- WHILE I'VE BEEN A PUBLIC. ELECTED OFFICIALS AT LOCAL LEVEL COUNTY LEVEL AND NOW UP HERE SO I LEARNED SO MUCH EACH TIME WE GO THROUGH ONE OF THESE THESE- NOMINATIONS AN APPOINTMENT PROCEDURES FOR PEOPLE IN THAT BUSINESS AND CERTAINLY YEAR AT THE HEADWATERS SO START WITH YOU BECAUSE IF I IF I DON'T CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT'S OF CONCERN TO ME AS- THE- MASSIVE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS WE MIGHT BE LOOKING OUT. AS WE TRIED TO IMPLEMENT THE GOVERNOR'S ELECTRIC VEHICLE MANDATE I THINK THE- ENERGY COMMISSION NOT RECENTLY- REPORTED THAT DEGRADE NEEDS THE EXPAND BE EXPANDED THREE FOLD AND- PERHAPS EVEN MORE THAN MATCHING AND- WILL NEED TO OVER A MILLION- A CHARGING STATIONS TO ACCOMMODATE I THINK WE'RE TALKING FROM MY RESEARCH HERE PRESENTED TO ME ON ABOUT EIGHT MILLION. ARE ELECTRIC VEHICLES COULD BE ON THE ROAD AT THAT TIME SO WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS AS WE'RE APPROACHING THAT TIME AND WHAT THOSE COSTS MIGHT BE A HOW WE MANAGE THOSE I'M CONCERNED THAT IF IT FALLS ON RATE PAYERS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SAME SITUATION THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES HAVING- YOU KNOW VERY DIFFICULT TO MEET SOME OF THE COSTS THAT THEY HAVE TO EXPERIENCE NOW SO. JUST KIND OF AN OPEN. ENDED QUESTION MISS LESLIE YOUR FOUGHT FOR ON ALL OF THAT AND ARE WE GETTING THERE ARE. YOUR YOUR POLICY THINKER THINK SO KNOW WE'RE TO GET THEIR TELL ME HOW. YEAH THANK YOU FOR OF KNOWLEDGE BEING THAT THAT- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO BE POSITIVE I THINK BECAUSE ON IT IT IS CHALLENGING AND I WOULDN'T. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART I DON'T THINK I THE ENERGY BUSINESS. YEAH YOU'RE GETTING OUT THERE IN IN THE IN THE TRENCHES YOU KNOW EITHER WORKING ON PROGRAMS OR MANAGING UTILITY LIKE G. AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T JUST JUMP INTO THIS BECAUSE EVEN WHEN YOU GET THERE SENATOR IT'S STILL LIKE THEY'RE SPEAKING ANOTHER LANGUAGE YOU LIKE YOU'VE LANDED ON THE MOON I CAN'T AS A NEW CONDITION MIGHT HAVE EXPERIENCES A COUPLE TIMES EVEN WITH ALL HER UTILITY EXPERIENCE THAT THAT THAT THERE'S A LOT TO LEARN AND ACTUALLY WHAT THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT REALLY A GREAT PLACE TO BE BECAUSE YOU TAKE ALL YOUR EXPERIENCE AND YOU COMBINE IT WITH THE THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW. AND THEN HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET A BETTER RESULT BECAUSE WE ARE NOT THE TECHNICAL EXPERTS SENATOR THE TACKLE IS FOR ITS FOR THE OUTSTANDING STAFF OF THE ICE SO YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN IN GOVERNMENT ON AND OFF FOR THIRTY YEARS AND I'VE SEEN A LOT OF PLACES OPERATE BUT THE ICE SO IS A IS A TOP NOTCH OPERATION I MEAN THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THIS GROUP IS REALLY INSPIRING YEAH I THINK THEY'RE PROBLEM SOLVERS AND THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS TECHNICAL SKILLS AND THAT'S WHY I'M OPTIMISTIC I'M JUST I'M NOT OPTIMISTIC FOR NO REASON YOU KNOW I LIKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO BE CONVINCED SOMETIMES YOU SHOW ME WHAT YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW I WOULD. ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO IN THE SPIRIT OF THAT I DO NOT THINK THE GOVERNOR HAS ENTERED INTO THIS COMMITMENT LIGHTLY I THINK HE HAS THOROUGHLY ANALYZED IT AND TAKING A LOOK AT IT AND I THINK HE DOES NOT WANT TO COST MORE AND I THINK WHAT WHAT HE'S THINKING IS THAT ELECTRIFICATION IS KEY TO GETTING TRIED 2% RENEWABLE GOALS IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS BECAUSE. IT DOES CREATE MORE. THE MAN. THE THAT'S FOR SURE. BUT THERE ARE MORE PAID PEOPLE PAY INTO THE GRIT. AND HOPEFULLY THOSE COSTS ARE LOWER. THAN WHAT THEY WOULD BE PAYING FOR OTHER FORMS OF. ENERGY SO I THINK THAT OUR FRIENDS AT THE CC. COMMISSIONER OCCURRING THAT ARE REALLY THE ONES WHO HAVE DONE THE FOR CASTING TO TELL US WHAT WE NEED THEY'RE TELLING US WE'RE GOING TO NEED AS YOU SAID AT LEAST ONE POINT TWO MILLION CHARGERS. AT LEAST EIGHT MILLION EV'S THEY'RE THEY'RE FIGURING WILL BE ON THE ROAD AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY I THINK ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF NEW ENERGY. NOW AT THE ICE SO WHAT WE DO IS WE STUDY. AND ANALYZE THAT AND THERE ARE PROTOCOLS IN THERE ARE PROCESSES THAT ARE REQUIRED AND THAT'S- THAT'S THE STAGE RING SENATOR IS THAT WORK. OR ANALYZING RIGHT NOW HOW THAT WILL WORK IN OUR ABILITY TO. TO INTEGRATE IT BUT I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE GIVEN EVERYTHING ELSE I'VE SEEN AYE SO INTEGRATE. THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO DO THAT. AND THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF COST EFFECTIVE. WAY AND AS YOU KNOW. BUT I SO HAVE AN ENERGY ABOUT MARKET WITH ABOUT. ENTITIES RIGHT NOW WILL HELP ALMOST TWENTY THREE IN TWO YEARS 180% OF THE WESTERN GREAT WITHIN. THE NEXT TWO YEARS AND SO WE ARE SPREADING. THE OPPORTUNITY AND THE RISK ACROSS THE WESTERN GREAT IN AND THE SAVINGS THAT HAVE COME FROM THIS INTERACTION. MEANS THAT WE HAVE SAVE MONEY IN TERMS OF- OF DELIVERING ELECTRICITY WILL ALSO BE ABLE TO. MOVE POWER THAT WEWOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TO CURTAIL INTO. OTHER MARKETS AND I THINK IT WILL BE A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF- OUR SUMMER READING S. BECAUSE LAST SUMMER. THE E. I AM PRODUCING ADDITIONAL SIXTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS WHEN WE WERE EXPERIENCING TIGHT SUPPLY SO THAT WAS CRITICAL. SO WE HAVE PARTNERS IN THIS WE HAVE WAYS TO REDUCE OUR COSTS- AND I DO FEEL CONFIDENT. WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO IT EVERY SIX CALLS. SEVEN THE CONSUMER AGREE US OUT THERE. WELL WHENEVER AGAIN GIVEN ANOTHER DIME ON THE UTILITY BILL THEY'RE NOT REAL HAPPY SO. ANYWAY I APPRECIATE THAT AND I WOULD HOPE THAT BECAUSE YOU SEEM TO HAVE VERY STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH THE THREE ENTITIES THE I SO THE EASY AND P. YOU SEE THAT YOU ARE WORKING TOGETHER THAT THERE WILL BE A REPORT I KNOW THE LAST ONE THAT WAS PRODUCES TWENTY SEVENTEEN- THAT'S PROBABLY ANTIQUATED NOW BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A- FEW MORE CHALLENGES SINCE THEY ON. THAT THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING VERY TANGIBLE THAT WE CAN START TO SHARE WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE THE CONSUMERS AND FOR THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE WHEN THINGS GO WRONG OUT THERE LIKE WHAT HAPPENED AND WHY DIDN'T. OF THINGS WORK THE WAY WE HOPE THEY WERE OR THE WAY THEY WERE PROMISED SO IF YOU COULD GIVE US SOME EXTRA ENERGY TO THAT- AND GETTING A REPORT OUT AND SOMETHING TO THE LEGISLATORS. EARLIER THAN LATER THAT WILL BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL- TO ALL FOR ALL OF US AS THE CONVERSATIONS GO FORWARD I'D LIKE TO TURN NOW TO MISSOURI AND DOG. I'LL JUST GIVE YOU ANOTHER OPEN ENDED QUESTION OF WE DID SUFFER THOSE BLACKOUTS IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THERE WAS A LOT OF THE BLAME GAME GOING ON WHICH IS PART OF OUR THEIR ARENA THAT WE ALL LIVE IN. THAT DOT HOW ARE WE LOOKING FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND YOU'VE BEEN SO INVOLVED IN OUR LIVES THAT ARE FLOOD SO YOU YOU WERE ON THE FRONT LINES THAT CERTAINLY THROUGH A NUMBER OF THE CHALLENGES THAT CAME WITH THIS EXTREMOPHILE. IN YOUR SERVICE SO HOW ARE WE LOOKING FOR THE FORMER COMING UP AND DOG HAVE WE PROCURED ENOUGH OR WE ARE RECOVERY READY FOR MIGHT. THAT MIGHT TO FALL OFF. WELL JUST BEFORE YOU GET ON THIS THE THIS MEETING. I AT THE ONE TIME WEATHER REPORT AND SAW THAT SACRAMENTO IS GOING TO BE A HUNDRED AND EIGHT AND A HUNDRED NINE THIS WEEKEND RIGHT. FORTUNATELY IT'S ON THE WEEKEND WHICH HELPS THE GRID- BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THEY HAVE THOSE KIND OF TEMPERATURES BECAUSE I USED TO WHEN I STILL WORKED ITS MIND AS YOU MENTIONED. UP TO MONITORING VERY CLOSELY BECAUSE- LOTUS VERY MUCH DRIVEN BY AIR CONDITIONING. AND AIR CONDITIONING IS DRIVEN BY TEMPERATURE AND WE ALL KNOW THAT AND THE CHALLENGE THAT WE SAW LAST SUMMER IS THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE HIGH TEMPS DIDN'T HIT JUST IN CALIFORNIA. THEY HIT EVERYWHERE AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN THAT. THIS YEAR WITH REALLY ALARMINGLY HEIGHT RECORD SETTING TEMPERATURES IN BRITISH COLUMBIA. IN SEATTLE AND PORTLAND WITH THE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES BECAUSE PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE COOLING CENTERS AND THEY WERE PREPARED TO HANDLE IT. I THINK THE CHALLENGE FOR US GOING INTO THE SUMMER IS THAT WE- PUT TOGETHER AS MANY SOLUTIONS JOINTLY FIRST I WANT TO COMMEND THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THE ISO. AND THE ENERGY COMMISSION FOR WORKING HAND IN GLOVE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE I'M- TRYING TO DO EVERYTHING WE COULD DO. IT FOR THE SUMMER WHAT WE DIDN'T THANK OR WHAT I DIDN'T THINK AT THE TIME IS THIS SUMMER MEANS NOW NOT AUGUST INSPECT HIM- LIKE IT WAS LAST YEAR WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THE HIGH TEMPERATURES. SO WE DO HAVE MORE GENERATION WE HAVE. ALL SERIES OF MARKET MAJORS THAT WERE JUST APPROVED BY FURK UNDER THE ISO TERRACE THAT HOPEFULLY WILL HELP BRING MORE ENERY AND WHEN WE NEED IT- WE ALSO HAVE NEW PROVISIONS THAT RELATE TO. RESOURCE ADEQUACY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLANTS AND PROJECTS AND DEMAND SIDE RESOURCES THAT WERE COUNTING ON DURING THESE CRITICAL PERIODS WILL ACTUALLY BE THERE. SO WE'RE TIGHTENINGUP ON HOW TO COUNT THE MAN RESPONSE RESOURCES WERE REQUIRING UNITS- POWER PLANTS THAT NEED TO TAKES SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE OUTAGES MAKE SURE THAT THEIR STANDBY ENERGY AVAILABLE TO COVER FOR THEM BEING GONE. THERE'S A WHOLE LIST OF MAJORS AND I FEEL LIKE. A LOT OF THE VERY HARD WORK HAS BEEN PUT INTO TRYING TO THINK ABOUT WHAT CAN WE DO TO EKE OUT EVERY LAST. HELLO AND KILOWATT HOUR THAT WE CAN TO BE READY FOR WHAT IS. PROVING TO BE A VERY TOUGH SUMMER WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THOSE VERY HIGH TEMPERATURES AND ON TOP OF THAT WE HAVE DROUGHT IN AS A RESULT WE END UP WITH LESS HYDROELECTRIC. PRODUCTION SO YOU MAY HAVE SEEN SOME SOMETHING IN THE NEWS THIS LAST WEEK THAT AGAIN IN PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE P. YOU SEE IN THE ENERGY COMMISSION. THE ISO IS NOW OUT ON THE STREETS I THINK THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE GETTING THE PROPOSAL STAND TODAY. FOR SOME ADDITIONAL POWER TO COVER WHAT WE ARE NOW ANTICIPATING IS EVEN POTENTIALLY. A BIGGER ISSUE THAN WHAT WE FORESAW A FEW MONTHS AGO. SO IT'S VERY CHALLENGING I DO THINK THAT PEOPLE. REFOCUS COLLABORATING. AND I THINK EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE SERIOUSNESS OF WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AND PARTICULARLY AS YOU MENTIONED WITH MICE MY BACKGROUND AND HAVING LIVED THROUGH THE FIRST ENERGY CRISIS. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN PEOPLE ARE STUCK IN ELEVATORS ARE WHEN THEY'RE REFRIGERATION FAILS AT THE GROCERY STORE AND THEY CAN'T. CONTINUE TO SELL THE FOOD BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE VIOLATING THE HEALTH STANDARDS BECAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN REFRIGERATED OR ON ICE LONG ENOUGH. HOSPITALS THAT HAVE TO GO ON BACK UP GENERATORS WORK THE SHERIFF CALLING SOMEONE NEEDS. TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS AREN'T WORKING AND HAVING A LOT OF THE- ALL THESE WITH TRAFFIC. SO IT'S FROM THE BUT IT DOESN'T TO THE SMALL BUT IT'S NEVER SMALL TO THE PERSON WHO'S EXPERIENCING AT. I CAN JUST ASSURE YOU THAT I DO THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN TO BE READY FOR IT. BUT WE ARE IN FOR A TOUGH SUMMER YEAH SO THAT WOULD BE MY ASSESSMENT WE ARE RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU FOR THAT MAJORITY BUT I THINK WHAT WAS REALLY CAME THROUGH IN YOUR DISCUSSION IS THAT BASED ON WHAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR- WE'RE NOT SITTING HERE ON INFORMED IN AND NOT NOT. TAKING ACTION AND SO THOSE ARE ALL GOOD THINGS THE HEARING AND WE CAN'T BE- RESPONSIBLE I GUESS OR ACCOUNTABLE FOR EVERY SINGLE THING THAT NOBODY ANTICIPATED WHATEVER HAPPENED BUT I THINK THE PUBLIC SKATING VERY OB. UP LET'S SAY THEIR PARTNER IN VERY WELL IN TERMS OF BEING CAREFUL ABOUT THE WAY THEY DO USE OF AIR CONDITIONING AND ALL THAT I KNOW IN MY COMMUNITY FIVE. CERTAINLY THAT COMES THROUGH SO I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR SERVICE BY JUMPING INTO THE FREE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO. ARENA IT IS FIVE FOR FULFILL BASIC CALL CERTAINLY TO OUR WELL BEING IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND IN OUR IN OUR STATE FOR SURE SAW YOU YOU BOTH ARE ARE WELL QUALIFIED WELL INFORMED- VERY IMPRESSIVE. SO YOU WILL CERTAINLY HAVE MY SUPPORT WE GET TO THAT THAT MOMENT. OF AND WITH THAT. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ORRIN HATCH. SAID LANE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I WAS IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE FOR YOUR OPENING STATEMENTS AND DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO HEAR THEM AND I THINK SOME OF THE THINGS I MIGHT ASK HAVE BEEN ASTOR DISCUSSED BUT- STILL ALL BE BRIEFER AND- THE ONE QUESTION I WAS GONNA ASK GOVERNOR SHORE YOU JUST SORT OF ADDRESSED BUT LET ME SEEIF YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU WISH TO ADD TO IT BECAUSE- DO YOU BRING A UNIQUE BACKGROUND HAVING BEEN THE- GENERAL MANAGER AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR A LOCAL UTILITY DISTRICT AND BRINGING IT. TO THIS AND- HE I JUST SUSPECT THEY'LL BE TIMES IN DEBATES ARE DECISIONS. WHEN YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SAY THIS IS HOW THAT THIS WALL OF REFLECT ON THE GROUND THIS IS INTERNAP STRENGTHENING. HOW WOULD YOU SPEAK TO ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANNA SAY ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO DO THAT GIVEN YOUR EXPERIENCE. YES THANK YOU THAT'S PROBABLY ALREADY HAPPENED MEMORIES FROM HIS SMILING A LITTLE BIT AS YOU ASK THAT QUESTION- MY LEGAL EXPERIENCE IT'S NOT THAT I WAS. INVOLVED IN FERTIGATION AND AS YOU ALL KNOW BURKE IS A EVERY THE ISO IS A FOR. REGULATED ENTITIES SO I THINK THAT WILL BE HELPFUL. I SPENT MANY MANY YEARS LICENSING AND BUILDING POWER PLANTS OF ALL KINDS RENEWABLE GAS AND- ALSO WORKING ON CUSTOMER DEMAND PROGRAMS. AND I ALSO DID A LOT OF POWER CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS SO I THINK I HAVE A LOT OF JUST PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IN THOSE AREAS AS ISSUES MAY CROP UP THAT I MAY BE ABLE TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION. LATER AS THE CEO WHICH I DID FOR ALMOST FIFTEEN YEARS. FROM THE PICTURE I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR RESOURCE PLANNING WHICH IS WORK AND STRATEGIC PLANNING WHICH IS WHERE YOU TAKE A LONGER VIEW YOU'RE NOT JUST LOOKING FOR SORT OF THE DAY TO DAY MANAGEMENT ISSUES BUT ALSO TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT ARE YOUR GOALS AND HOW DO YOU GET THERE AND PARTICULARLY WHEN THE GOALS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN MY CASE BY A PUBLICLY ELECTED BOARD. MY JOB IS THE MANAGER THERE WAS TO FIGURE OUT HOW YOU ACTUALLY GET THERE SO I'M HOPING I AM SORT OF PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE ON HOW TO SET- BUT CREATE WHAT I USED TO CALL THE PUNCH LIST OF WHAT YOU NEED TO GET DONE. THE TASKS THAT NEED TO BE ACCOMPLISHED AND SENATE METRIC SO YOU MEASURE WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHING WHAT YOU DO. AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST I DID MANAGE SMILED DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS SO I HAD THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF LIVING THROUGH THAT WITH THE CUSTOMERS AND I KNOW ABOUT HOW SERIOUS THE CONSEQUENCES OF ROLLING OUTAGES CAN BEAT TO CONSUMERS. WHO ARE ECONOMY THAT PEOPLE DEPEND ON ELECTRICITY EACH AND EVERY DAY FOR EVERYTHING THEY DO AT THIS POINT. AND HOPEFULLY. I WILL HAVE SOME. OF THE ABILITY TO REFLECT THAT AS WE ENGAGE IN DECISION MAKING AT THE HIGHEST SO. LAST BUT NOT LEAST- WE SPENT FIFTEEN YEARS I THINK ARE MORE LITIGATING MARKET POWER ABUSES SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS A CRITICAL ROLE THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T GET TALKED ABOUT AS MUCH. AT THE I SO BUT IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL IS THE ISO IS YOUR TOOL. USED THE LEGISLATURE. OR ENSURING THAT MARKET POWER ABUSES ARE NOT GOING ON AND WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT STAFF AN INDEPENDENT STAFF. THAT WORK ON THOSE ISSUES DAY AND NIGHT AND SO I FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE. IN TELLING YOU THAT. THEY GOT THERE THEY ARE THERE I ON THE BALL. THANK YOU THAT WAS VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE ISHOULD SAY THAT. I AM VERY MUCH ENJOYED- OF THE CHANCE TO TALK WITH BOTH OF YOU. UP EARLIER THIS WEEK. AND FOR GOVERNOR LESLIE LET ME JUST ASK YOU- ONE OF THE THINGS YOU SAID- IN OUR CONVERSATION AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH. THE DISCUSSION HAS GONE TO CLIMATE US FOR. IT SAID EXTREME WEATHER COULD BE OUR NEW NORMAL. AND GIVEN THE NEW NORMAL THAT HAS EXTREME WEATHER WITH DRAMATIC INFLUENCES ON THE GRID. HOW DO YOU SEE YOUR ROLE AND SORT OF TRYING TO PREPARE FOR THAT DEALING WITH THAT. YEAH I WISH. I WAS BEING FLAT BED I ACTUALLY MANAGE I THINK THAT WE ARE WE'RE AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TWO YEARS AGO WHEN I FIRST WAS SITTING THERE LIKE JANICE TODAY WAS WE DIDN'T WE HAVEN'T EXPERIENCING EXTREME WEATHER- IT BAD IN THE ENTIRE WESTERN GRID AT THE SAME TIME YEAH THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE ONCE EVERY THIRTY YEARS RIGHT- BUT THE TRUTH IS NOW WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS EVEN WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR THIS YEAR AND AS YOU KNOW IT'S EARLY JULY. THAT THIS IS NOW. THE IMPACT OF THE CHANGES IN OUR CLIMATE ARE BECOMING MORE EVIDENT IN EXTREME HEAT IN THE NORTHWEST IS NOW. A REGULAR EVENT SO I THINK IN TERMS OF OUR PLANNING I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH SENATOR. THE DIFFERENCE WITH THE INTER AGENCY PLAN. YOU KNOW EVERY EVERYBODY WAS SORT OF IN THE SILOS WHEN I FIRST SHOWED UP NOBODY IS IN A SILO ANYMORE EVERYBODY TALKS TO EVERYBODY. IN FACT YOU KNOW OUR OUR NEW CEO. ELLIE IT MEANS- NEEDS PLANS REGULAR MEETINGS WITH NOT ONLY HIS COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF YOU SEE AN SEC BUT ALSO THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE WESTERN GRID AND OF COURSE ALL OUR STAKEHOLDERS AS PART OF OUR YEAH YEAH. SO WE NOW HAVE A VERY LARGE AUDIENCE INCLUDING YOURSELF IN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE THAT WE ARE COMMUNICATING WITH REGULARLY AND THE BENEFIT OF ALL THAT IS THE ENHANCE COMMUNICATION COOPERATION. NOW HAS TIGHTENED UP THE PLANET. SO THAT THAT SENATORS WERE CONCERNED. YOU KNOW INITIALLY AFTER THAT THE LOAD SHEDDING LAST SUMMER THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE A PLAN GOING INTO THIS SUMMER I ASSURE YOU THAT IS NOT TRUE WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE A PLAN GOING INTO THE SUMMER RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH MORE WE COULD DO IN TERMS OF OUR PREPARATION AND AS JAN WAS SAYING WE WOULD TAKEN SEVERAL ACTIONS RECENTLY IN WHICH THE CAPACITY PROCUREMENT MECHANISM. WAS ISSUED EARLY THIS MONTH FOR A THIRTY DAY NOTICE OF UP TO THREE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF NEW CAPACITY WHICH AS YOU KNOW OUR DELTA LAST SUMMER WAS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND MEGAWATTS SO. I THINK WE HAVE WHERE AT A VERY GOOD PLAN OF HOW WE WILL BE PREPARED NOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO STAY PREPARED. I DON'T THINK. YOU KNOW THIS BETWEEN ME THE EXTREME HEAT B. WHAT USED TO BE THE SUMMER FIRES RIGHT THERE ARE THAT ARE ARE ARE ARE TURNING INTO POTENTIALLY MORE YEAR ROUND FIRES I THINK. YOU'RE SEEING THAT- ALL OF THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN DO AS WELL AS ALL THE LOS SERVING ENTITIES. YOU KNOW HARDENING THEIR GRADES. YOU KNOW IT I THINK WE KNOW WE'RE PREPARING WE'RE GETTING READY AND THE GOOD NEWS IS OUT OF THE TRANSITION- AND REINVEST WE DO THIS KNOWING WE HAVE TO BE RESILIENT. AND THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE NO YOU HAVE TO BE RESILIENT IS THAT IS THAT IS PERSON IS JUST DOING IT LIKE YOU USED TO IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT WAY OF LOOKING AT THINGS AND I THINK WE'RE VERY MUCH. OF THE MIND THAT WE HOW WE THAT WE HAVE TO BE A RESERVE. EVERY IS. SYSTEM THANK YOU ARE REALLY. THE ANSWER. YOU MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT YOU'RE BEING FLIPPED WHICH YOU'RE BEING ACCURATE. SO FIVE FIVE I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT- AND I'M GOING TO BE VERY COMFORTABLE WITH COFFEE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO ASK QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR AND OBVIOUSLY GIVEN YOUR BACKGROUND AND MORE RECENT HISTORY IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU A PART OF THESE DISCUSSIONS AS WE- CERTAINLY TAKE UP. THESE TYPES OF APPOINTMENTS WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ENERGY COMMISSION THE CPUC AKAU I SO I JUST DUG COMMENTED TO A STAFF MEMBER I'D LOVE TO BE A FLY ON THE WALL AT ONE OF YOUR COCKTAIL PARTIES OF INCREDIBLY BRIGHT PEOPLE. HI I AMNOT KIDDING ACTUALLY IT WOULD BE QUITE AN ENJOY ENJOYABLE THING TO HEAR- THE BACK AND FORTH- I THINK MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ASKED A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR BOTH OF YOU- AND ALL I'LL LET YOU GO FIRST MISS LESLEE- SINCE YOU'VE GOT SENIORITY ALTHOUGH LISTENING TO BOTH OF YOU I GOTTA SAY. AGAIN ALL REFERENCE THE COCKTAIL PARTY- HOW CONFIDENT ARE YOU THAT ENTER IN INTO A REGIONAL GRID WON'T JEOPARDIZE CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN ENERGY POLICIES AND- REALLY WHAT I MEAN BY THAT AS- YOU CONTINUE. TO- HI OF LOOK AT TRACKING. WILL THE IMPROVE TRACKING OF SECONDARY DISPATCH INSURE THAT ARE THE PARTICIPATING ENTITIES ARE BACKFILLING RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES WITH FOSSIL BASED PRODUCTION. AND THE REASON I ASK THAT IS I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHY WE'VE HAD THIS YEAR'S A LONG. CONVERSATION AND SORT OF DISAGREEMENT OVER GOVERNANCE. AND THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE AROUND I HAVEN'T SOME- INPUT WITH CAL AYSO THROUGH THIS APPOINTMENT PROCESS IF AND I THINK BOTH OF YOUR FOR PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THAT LONG. CONVERSATION IN HISTORY SO MISS LESLIE DO YOU WANT TO START JUST COMMENT ON ON THAT FROM THE BROAD VIEW- APPRECIATE. REAL THAT THE SENIOR MEMBER. NO I REMEMBER SENATOR AL WELL THE FIRST THING I ALWAYS LIKE TO SAY WHEN ASKED THIS QUESTION IS YOU KNOW THE ULTIMATE DECISION RESTS WITH. YOU SENATOR AND THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT THERE IS NO CHANGE IN GOVERNOR'S THERE'S NO REGIONALIZATION WITHOUT THE STATE LEGISLATURE SO YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE. YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE. YOU KNOW YOU WOULD HAVE TO FEEL REALLY CONFIDENT THAT IT WASN'T CALIFORNIA'S INTEREST TO. TO DO THAT. THEN THEN I WOULD SAY THAT A HORSE ARE ONLY LAWS PROTECT US RIGHT YOU CAN'T INSURE SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA'S A LOT SO EASY- YOU KNOW. WHAT WE'RE CRITICIZED BECAUSE AS WE PROCURE WE'RE TAKING CLEAN ENERGY OUT OF THE OTHER WESTERN STATES RIGHT THERE THERE IS THE REVERSE ARGUMENT ACTUALLY NOW WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS ENTIRE DISCUSSION IS HOW THE FIELD CHANGE RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW WHEN WE AGAIN TO TWO AND A HALF YEARS AGO YOU DIDN'T HAVE THIS ALIGNMENT OF WESTERN STATES WITH YOU KNOW EVEN ARIZONA IN AND OF BAD AT IT YEAH WE HAD OREGON WE HAVE WASHINGTON WE DON'T CALL AROUND. THESE STATES ARE ALL ADOPTING THEIR OWN CLEAN ENERGY GOALS FOR THEIR STATE SO ADDS THAT ALIGNMENT AS AN ALIGNMENT THE CURSE OF AGREEING THAT THIS IS OUR FUTURE THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT MAKES. IT MUCH MORE APPEALING FOR IT DOESN'T. FOR US TO HAVE A MORE TO CONSIDER A MORE INTEGRATED GREAT NOW THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS YOU KNOW THE E. I AM. WE STARTED THE I AM THE E. IDEA NOW HAS SIXTEEN PARTNERS RIGHT- THOSE ARE THE ENERGY IMBALANCE MARKET PARTNERS. AND WITHIN FEW YEARS OR LESS WILL HAVE TWENTY THREE PARTNERS WILL HAVE 80% OF THE WESTERN GRIT. NOW WHAT IT WHAT WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE WE CREATED THIS PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SIXTEEN WELL WHEN WE WERE IN TROUBLE LAST SUMMER. WE HAD AN ADDITIONAL SIXTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATTS WE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD IF WE HADN'T HAD THE RELATIONSHIP RIGHT WE WOULD'VE IN TEXAS KIND OF BY OURSELVES YEAH HEY. WE WERE HAPPY WE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP TO GET THE SIXTEEN HUNDRED EXTRA MAY WHAT'S WE'RE ALSO VERY HAPPY THAT IT SAVED US. OVER A BILLION DOLLARS YOU KNOW IN COST. AND THAT WE HAD WHEN WE WHEN WE CREATED IN A QUOTE OVERSUPPLIED ENERGY CLEAN ENERGY WE HAD A MARKET TO SELL INTO RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE TO CURTAIL ANYMORE. SO ALL THE EVIDENCE IN MY OPINION ABOUT THIS WESTERN RELATIONSHIP WITH THE IBM IS FAVORABLE. NOW WHEN YOU GO TO THE NEXT STEP THE EDM RIGHT BECAUSE THOUGH THE I AM STRAINING 5% YOU KNOW IT'S A REAL TIME MARKET RETREATING 5% REAL TIME MARKET. THE NEXT THING WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT MODELING THE EDEA THEY HAD MARKET BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TRADING HOW 2% THE ENERGY WAS SOMETHING. THAT WERE MODELING THAT WE'RE SEEING THAT WE'RE SEEING THE BENEFITS. WITH WITH THE PLUSES AND NEGATIVES OF THAT ARE. AND AS YOU KNOW SENATOR. DIFFERENT DIFFERENT. STATE HOW ISSUES WITH. THEY AGREE WITH THOSE A PERCENT SO BUT I THINK THE DECISION ABOUT TRADING IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF DECISION NOW BUT IT ONLY WORKS IF YOU CAN PROTECT YOUR OWN YOU KNOW YOUR OWN STANDARDS YOUR OWN LOSS YOUR OWN REQUIREMENTS FOR PROCUREMENT SO I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE I THINK WE'RE STILL WAITING AND SEEING BUT RIGHT NOW THE EVIDENCE IS LEANING TOWARDS. THE WESTERN E. I AM HAS REALLY BEEN A GOOD THING FOR CALIFORNIA. SURE ANYTHING YOU WANNA ADD TO THAT YEAH I WAS GOING TO SAY LET ME THAT WAS A GREAT ANSWER RIGHT MARY BUT I'LL GO AHEAD. WITH A LITTLE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WRINKLE FIRST OFF I'LL SAY IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU ARE EVERYBODY WOULD LIKE TO FIND THE CHEAPEST STUFF THEY CAN. NUMBER ONE. CALIFORNIA EVERY DAY IS DEMONSTRATING THAT. RENEWABLES WORK. THAT THEY ACTUALLY CAN MAKE LOAD. THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE THAT YOU CANNOT SIGN CAPACITY VALUE TO THEM THAT THEY DO OPERATE THE WAY THEY'RE EXPECTED TO OPERATE. AND DURING THE PERIODS WHERE THE SUN IS NOT SHINING OR THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING I'M NOT BLOWING YOU CAN BACK THEM UP. WITH BATTERIES AND WE'RE STARTING TO DEMONSTRATE WE'VE SHOWN A NORMA'S PROGRESS IN MY VIEW. AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO WITH BATTERIES AND OTHER STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES AND THIS CONCEPT OF A HYBRID SOLAR PLANT. THAT BASICALLY USES SOLAR ENERGY SURPLUS SOLAR ENERGY TO RECHARGE ITS BATTERIES. IS REMARKABLE. AND IS COST EFFECTIVE. AND IS GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTING TO PEOPLE ACROSS THE WEST. I THINK THAT AS A PRACTICAL MATTER IF YOU LOOK AT COAL PLANTS AROUND THE WEST THEY ARE CLOSING BECAUSE THEY ARE ON ECONOMIC. IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE MUCH TO DO WITH. MAYBE A STATE POLICY IN WYOMING ABOUT. NOT RENEWABLES IT HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT IT IS NO LONGER ECONOMIC FOR THOSE PLANTS TO OPERATE AND WE'RE CERTAINLY. BASICALLY AFTER WHAT'S HAPPENED THIS YEAR WE'RE STARTING TO SEE A LOT OF VOLATILITY. IN GAS PRICES AS WELL. SO FROM. FROM THE VERY BIG PICTURE WE HAVE MADE SUCH PROGRESS WITH THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE COST. BUT I THINK THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE VERY FOCUSED ON. WHAT'S THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO DO THINGS WHAT'S THE MOST AFFORDABLE WAY TO GET ELECTRICITY TO CONSUMERS. THEY'RE GOING TO SEE THAT CALIFORNIA'S PATH IS GIVING US THE ERROR. AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN FIGURING OUT. HOW DO YOU INCREASE THAT. AND IF YOU ADD GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY OF RESOURCES SO THAT YOU SPREAD. SO TO SPEAK YOUR FOOT PRINT OF RESOURCES THAT YOU CAN MIX AND MATCH. YOU'RE GOING TO COME UP WITH BETTER COST STRUCTURE FOR EVERYBODY. SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. THE UNDERLYING ECONOMICS. AND SO BORENSTEIN OUR BOARD IS PROBABLY ONE BETTER THAN THAN ME THE OTHER ONE ACT. ARE DRIVING US TO THE CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S LEADING ON. BUT THE ROLE THE AYE AS WELL AS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS HE PROVING IT WORKS EVERY DAY. THAT'S OUR JOB. WELL THANK YOU. THAT WAS THAT WAS A- COMPREHENSIVE SUBSTANTIVE I APPRECIATE THAT FROM BOTH OF YOU THANK YOU- ALL OF THE COLLEAGUES HERE HAVE I THINK HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS SO I THINK UNLESS ANYONE ELSE HAS A COMMENT OR QUESTION WILL GO AHEAD MOVE TO MEMBERS OF THE PBLIC.
