ONGOING LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATION

00:29:10.949 --> 00:29:13.218

THANK YOU.

00:29:23.828 --> 00:29:26.664
I WONDER AND PERHAPS THE

00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:28.233
ASSEMBLY MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER

00:29:28.299 --> 00:29:30.101
THIS BECAUSE WE THE SENATE

00:29:30.168 --> 00:29:31.503

00:29:31.569 --> 00:29:33.271

HANDLE THESE INVESTIGATIONS.

00:29:58.663 --> 00:29:59.564
A MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT

00:29:59.631 --> 00:30:00.999
WOULD BE A COMBINATION OF THOSE

00:30:01.065 --> 00:30:02.600
INDIVIDUALS.

00:30:02.667 --> 00:30:05.170
BUT MOSTLY ATTORNEYS BECAUSE

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:11.609

FOUR STATES NOW THAT HAVE SET

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:17.849
UP SOMETHING.

00:30:17.916 --> 00:30:19.717
PERHAPS NOT THE SAME BUT

00:30:19.784 --> 00:30:21.553

00:30:27.425 --> 00:30:29.694
IN MY SUB.

00:30:29.761 --> 00:30:31.529
WE DIDN'T HAVE NO WAY TO REALLY

00:30:31.596 --> 00:30:33.565
EVALUATE WHETHER.

00:30:33.631 --> 00:30:33.798
THIS IS.

00:30:33.865 --> 00:30:37.535
.

00:30:37.602 --> 00:30:38.603
WHETHER THIS IS.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.471
MORE.

00:30:40.538 --> 00:30:41.706
MORE PERSONNEL THAN MIGHT BE

WHETHER THEIR IS.

00:30:47.979 --> 00:30:49.147
WHAT THE LEVEL OF WORKLOAD

00:30:49.214 --> 00:30:50.048
MIGHT BE?

00:30:50.114 --> 00:30:53.384
?

00:30:53.451 --> 00:30:54.519
BUT I DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE

00:30:54.586 --> 00:30:56.854
OTHER STATES THAT NOW HAVE

00:30:56.921 --> 00:30:59.023
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATORY TEAMS

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:02.994
FOR OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS.

00:31:03.061 --> 00:31:04.429

00:31:04.495 --> 00:31:05.930
I WOULD ARGUE AND I DO WANT

00:31:05.997 --> 00:31:07.732

WHATEVER WE GET AROUND TO VOTING

ON THIS BUT. THIS IS.

00:31:12.237 --> 00:31:13.705
DUPLICATIVE.

00:31:13.771 --> 00:31:15.440
ALREADY ONE WE HAVE THESE THE

00:31:15.506 --> 00:31:16.941
DEPARTMENT.

00:31:17.008 --> 00:31:18.876
CONDUCTION INVESTIGATION.

00:31:18.943 --> 00:31:21.112
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY.

00:31:21.179 --> 00:31:23.748
CAN INVESTIGATE.

00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:27.218
AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

00:31:27.285 --> 00:31:28.052
IT CAN BE REFERRED TO THESE

00:31:28.119 --> 00:31:29.687
GENERAL GENERAL.

00:31:29.754 --> 00:31:30.755
THAT HAS HAPPENED EVEN HERE

00:31:30.822 --> 00:31:32.757
RECENTLY.

00:31:32.824 --> 00:31:35.360
SO I REALLY SEE NO NEED.

00:31:35.426 --> 00:31:37.128
FOR THIS SO CALLED TEAM OF

00:31:37.195 --> 00:31:38.830

00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:51.042
.

00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:51.676
HOW THIS WOULD WORK IS THAT A

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:53.177
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WOULD HAVE

00:31:53.244 --> 00:31:54.612
THE OPTION TO?

00:31:54.679 --> 00:31:56.981

I ENGAGE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

00:31:58.883 --> 00:31:59.751
TO DO AN INDEPENDENT

00:31:59.817 --> 00:32:01.219
INVESTIGATION IT WOULD NOT BE

00:32:01.286 --> 00:32:02.620
MANDATORY.

00:32:02.687 --> 00:32:03.955

CALIFORNIA.

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:08.159
I'D BELIEVE IT'S A BIPARTISAN

00:32:08.226 --> 00:32:10.428
GROUP OF JURISDICTIONS.

00:32:10.495 --> 00:32:15.066

IF WE'RE GOING TO USE PEACE

00:32:20.872 --> 00:32:22.940
OFFICERS.

00:32:23.007 --> 00:32:24.842

00:32:24.909 --> 00:32:26.711

00:32:35.286 --> 00:32:36.754
THAT THEY DO.

00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:39.657
WE WE HAVE A POOL OF RETIRED.

00:32:39.724 --> 00:32:41.392
POLICE OFFICERS I COULD DO. THIS

00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:43.294

OUTSIDE CONTRACTORS.

00:32:45.229 --> 00:32:46.898
AND IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT

00:32:46.964 --> 00:32:48.166
WOULD BE A BETTER SOLUTION. FOR

00:32:48.232 --> 00:32:50.134
LIKE JAMS SURFER RETIRED JUDGES

00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:52.403

THAT'S.

00:33:04.982 --> 00:33:06.384
NOT GOING TO COME TO FRUITION

00:33:06.451 --> 00:33:08.619
BUT ALSO AN ISSUE TO WORK. USING

00:33:08.686 --> 00:33:09.721

00:33:09.787 --> 00:33:11.756

THAT THEY RECEIVED AND HOW MUCH

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:23.060
EVIDENCE WAS PROCESSED.

00:34:23.127 --> 00:34:24.195
WE WOULD RECOMMEND THE ASSEMBLY

00:34:24.262 --> 00:34:25.997
ACTION ON THIS ITEM AS IT WOULD

00:34:26.063 --> 00:34:27.331
PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE WITH

00:34:27.398 --> 00:34:29.100
MORE INFORMATION ON WHAT THE

00:34:29.167 --> 00:34:31.402
BACKLOG IS. HOW MUCH RESOURCES

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:32.670
WOULD BE NEEDED TO ELIMINATE THE

00:34:32.737 --> 00:34:34.005
BACKLOG AND POTENTIALLY WHAT THE

00:34:34.071 --> 00:34:35.773
NEED WOULD BE ON AN ONGOING

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:37.175
BASIS IN THE FUTURE TO AVOID A

00:34:37.241 --> 00:34:42.213
BACKLOG ENTIRELY?

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.081
THE US COAST.

00:34:44.148 --> 00:34:45.016
THANK YOU THIS IS AGAIN A

00:34:45.082 --> 00:34:46.350
LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATION THAT

00:34:46.417 --> 00:34:47.518
THE ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T

00:34:47.585 --> 00:34:48.753
SUPPORT AT THIS TIME WE WOULD

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.188
HOWEVER NOTE THAT CURRENTLY THE

00:34:50.254 --> 00:34:51.422
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DOES NOT

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:53.591
HAVE A BACKLOG. OF SEXUAL

00:34:53.658 --> 00:34:55.760
ASSAULT KITS IT'S UNKNOWN ONTO

00:34:55.827 --> 00:34:56.661
THE ANALYSTS POINT OUT WHAT THE

00:34:56.727 --> 00:34:58.229
BACKLOG IS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:34:58.296 --> 00:34:59.363
BECAUSE TRADITIONALLY THIS

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:00.465
INFORMATION IS NOT TRACK.

00:35:00.531 --> 00:35:03.301
AT THE STATE LEVEL.

00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:04.435
SORCERER.

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:05.503
THANK YOU.

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:08.239
.

00:35:08.306 --> 00:35:09.407
SO FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT NOT

00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:10.541
FOLLOW THIS ISSUE WHEN THE

00:35:10.608 --> 00:35:12.143
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.878
IF THEY DON'T HAVE A BACKLOG.

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:15.646
THEY ARE REFERRING TO.

00:35:15.713 --> 00:35:17.815
THEIR LAPS THE STATE RUNS AND

00:35:17.882 --> 00:35:19.851
ALL OF THE AGENCIES THAT UTILIZE

00:35:19.917 --> 00:35:20.918
THE STATE LAB.

00:35:20.985 --> 00:35:22.887
AND THERE ARE.

00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:26.123
THE THE MAJORITY OF AGENCIES IN

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:27.558
THE STATE USE THE STATE LAB

00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:30.027
HOWEVER SOME OF THE AGENCIES

00:35:30.094 --> 00:35:31.629
THAT DON'T USE THE STATE LAB ARE

00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:33.531
VERY VERY LARGE.

00:35:33.598 --> 00:35:34.732
SO IN TERMS OF.

00:35:34.799 --> 00:35:36.300
.

00:35:36.367 --> 00:35:38.536
WHETHER HOW REPRESENTATIVE THE

00:35:38.603 --> 00:35:40.771
FACT THAT THERE IS NO LONGER A

00:35:40.838 --> 00:35:42.440
BACKLOG.

00:35:42.507 --> 00:35:43.808
FROM THE STATE LABS.

00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:46.444
STILL IS.

00:35:46.511 --> 00:35:48.446
GIVES ITS ITS.

00:35:48.513 --> 00:35:51.415
VERY GOOD TO NO AND VERY GOOD

00:35:51.482 --> 00:35:53.451
THAT IT HAS NO BACKLOG IT JUST

00:35:53.518 --> 00:35:54.952
DOESN'T NECESSARILY INFORM US

00:35:55.019 --> 00:35:57.588
FULLY OF WHAT THE BACK LIKE IT'S.

00:35:57.655 --> 00:36:01.792
NOW OBVIOUSLY AS ELLIE ó SAID.

00:36:01.859 --> 00:36:02.627
IF WE.

00:36:02.693 --> 00:36:04.362
GO WITH THE SIMILES ACTION AND

00:36:04.428 --> 00:36:06.998
DO THE AUDIT WE KNOW WHAT IT IS.

00:36:07.064 --> 00:36:07.665
HOWEVER.

00:36:07.732 --> 00:36:10.067
BECAUSE OF THE ATTENTION ON

00:36:10.134 --> 00:36:11.569
THIS ISSUE AND BECAUSE OF PAST

00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:13.304
FEDERAL FUNDS.

00:36:13.371 --> 00:36:15.239
THERE IS INDICATION THAT THE

00:36:15.306 --> 00:36:18.075
BACKLOG HAS BEEN GREATLY REDUCED

00:36:18.142 --> 00:36:19.977
AND THAT THE ALLOCATION THAT THE

00:36:20.044 --> 00:36:23.247
SENATE IS RECOMMENDING WOULD.

00:36:23.314 --> 00:36:24.649
IT WE CAN'T GUARANTEE NOT

00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:25.816
KNOWING THE EXACT NUMBER THAT IT

00:36:25.883 --> 00:36:27.151
WOULD.

00:36:27.218 --> 00:36:31.489
CLEAR UP ANY AGENCIES BUT GIVEN

00:36:31.556 --> 00:36:33.224
THAT IT REQUIRES THE WAY WE

00:36:33.291 --> 00:36:34.425
STRUCTURED IT A MATCH FROM THE

00:36:34.492 --> 00:36:37.028
AGENCY. IS UNLIKELY

00:36:37.094 --> 00:36:39.397
TO DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF

00:36:39.463 --> 00:36:41.165
ELIMINATING ORDER A HUGELY

00:36:41.232 --> 00:36:42.733
REDUCING THE BACKLOG JUST

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.634
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE

00:36:43.701 --> 00:36:45.937
ALREADY KNOW. THAT EVERY AGENCY

00:36:46.003 --> 00:36:46.971
THAT RELIES ON THE STATE LAB NO

00:36:47.038 --> 00:36:50.408
LONGER HOUSE WHEN.

00:36:50.474 --> 00:36:51.676
THEY KEEP. ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF

00:36:51.742 --> 00:36:52.877
THE ROAD THANK MISTER CHAIR I

00:36:52.944 --> 00:36:54.545
QUESTION FOR THE LA ALSO MY

00:36:54.612 --> 00:36:56.047
NOTES SAY THAT THE ASSEMBLY

00:36:56.113 --> 00:36:57.715
PROPOSAL.

00:36:57.782 --> 00:36:59.317
SUPPORTS ACTIVITIES RELATED TO

00:36:59.383 --> 00:37:00.785
THE DISPOSITION OF SEXUAL

00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:02.753
ASSAULT KITS SO WE TALKING WHEN

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:03.988
IT ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE

00:37:04.055 --> 00:37:05.756
DISPOSITION ARE WE TESTING THEM

00:37:05.823 --> 00:37:08.626
OR WE JUST COUNTING THEM.

00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:09.860
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT IS

00:37:09.927 --> 00:37:12.229
ACCOUNT SO THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY

00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:14.565
THE NUMBER OF KIDS THAT ARE.

00:37:14.632 --> 00:37:16.767
THAT. ARE PROCESSED EVIDENCE

00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:18.302
THAT IS OUT THERE. THERE WAS A

00:37:18.369 --> 00:37:20.204
STATE LAW THAT WAS ENACTED ON IN

00:37:20.271 --> 00:37:21.672
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SO AS OF

00:37:21.739 --> 00:37:23.007
JANUARY FIRST TWO THOUSAND

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:24.442
EIGHTEEN ANY EVIDENCE COLLECTED

00:37:24.508 --> 00:37:26.310
AT THAT POINT. WE NOW HAVE IN

00:37:26.377 --> 00:37:27.011
THE SYSTEM IT'S GOING TO BE

00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:29.280
REPORTED BUT PRIOR TO THAT WE

00:37:29.347 --> 00:37:30.448
ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH IS

00:37:30.514 --> 00:37:31.382
OUTSTANDING AND HAS BEEN ON

00:37:31.449 --> 00:37:32.650
PROCESS AND SO MY UNDERSTANDING

00:37:32.717 --> 00:37:34.051
IS THAT THIS ONE TIME FUNDING IS

00:37:34.118 --> 00:37:35.486
TO GET A GOOD IDEA WHAT'S OUT

00:37:35.553 --> 00:37:37.521
THERE. KIND OF ELIMINATE THAT.

00:37:37.588 --> 00:37:38.756
WELL I'M INTERESTED IN NOT JUST

00:37:38.823 --> 00:37:40.091
COUNTING THEM BUT TESTING THEM

00:37:40.157 --> 00:37:42.059
SO WHY WOULD YOU NOT RECOMMEND

00:37:42.126 --> 00:37:42.827
THE SENATE VERSION OVER THE

00:37:42.893 --> 00:37:44.595
ASSEMBLY VERSION IN THAT CASE.

00:37:44.662 --> 00:37:46.297
I MEAN I I THINK FOR OUR

00:37:46.364 --> 00:37:47.632
PERSPECTIVE IT IS THIS ISSUE OF

00:37:47.698 --> 00:37:49.200
WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY IS OUT

00:37:49.266 --> 00:37:50.935
THERE AND SO ON THE ASSEMBLY

00:37:51.002 --> 00:37:51.869
VERSION IN CONDUCTING THAT

00:37:51.936 --> 00:37:52.837
COUNTY WOULD PROVIDE THE

00:37:52.903 --> 00:37:53.738
LEGISLATURE WITH THAT

00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:57.174
INFORMATION IN TERMS OF HOW

00:37:57.241 --> 00:37:58.976
LARGE. THE BACKLOG IS.

00:37:59.043 --> 00:38:00.678
ELIMINATED AND WHAT FUNDING

00:38:00.745 --> 00:38:01.979
WOULD BE NEEDED ON AN ONGOING

00:38:02.046 --> 00:38:02.847
BASIS TO AVOID A BACKLOG

00:38:02.913 --> 00:38:04.482
ENTIRELY.

00:38:04.548 --> 00:38:07.184
AND SO WE THINK THAT PROVIDES

00:38:07.251 --> 00:38:08.919
MAKE THAT DECISION OKAY WELL

00:38:08.986 --> 00:38:10.955
BEEN. IN MOST CASES I'M A FAN OF

00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:12.556
BEING DELIVERED TO BUT.

00:38:12.623 --> 00:38:13.924
IN THIS CASE THIS IS AN ISSUE

00:38:13.991 --> 00:38:14.525
WE'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH FOR

00:38:14.592 --> 00:38:16.293

THOSE THOSE UNTESTED KIDS GET

00:38:17.895 --> 00:38:19.230
TESTED AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

00:38:19.296 --> 00:38:20.498
THE SIX ABOUT SIX AND A HALF

00:38:20.564 --> 00:38:22.199
MILLION DOLLARS. THAT THE SENATE

PROPOSAL PROVIDES AYE IS STILL

00:38:24.001 --> 00:38:24.602
PROBABLY GOING TO BE

00:38:24.669 --> 00:38:26.237
INSUFFICIENT TO TESTALL OF THE

00:38:26.303 --> 00:38:27.605
UNTESTED KITS THAT ARE OUT THERE

00:38:27.672 --> 00:38:29.507
EVEN IF THEY ARE GREATLY REDUCED

00:38:29.573 --> 00:38:31.742
AS YOU SAY SO. OF THAT PIE I

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:33.844
THINK I'M IN FAVOR OF HAVE A

00:38:33.911 --> 00:38:34.979

NOTE THAT THE.

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:32.790
I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH PRIDE

00:41:32.857 --> 00:41:34.258
INDUSTRIES.

00:41:34.325 --> 00:41:36.660
AND THEIR SUCCESSES.

00:41:36.727 --> 00:41:39.363
NEVER ABILITIES.

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.332
IS S. LITIGATION.

00:41:41.398 --> 00:41:47.438
PENDING OR THREATENED.

00:41:47.504 --> 00:41:47.938
THEY ARE NOT DOORS WITH

00:41:48.005 --> 00:41:48.772
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE

00:41:48.839 --> 00:41:50.708
LITIGATION IS THREATENED AT THIS

00:41:50.774 --> 00:41:52.543
POINT IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT I DO WE

00:41:52.610 --> 00:41:56.046
HOUSE US BOND TO A THREAT.

00:41:56.113 --> 00:41:57.815
WELL I THINK THAT THE RISK IS F.

00:41:57.882 --> 00:42:00.784
WE PROCEED WITHOUT. ARE

00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:02.219
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THIS THIS

00:42:02.286 --> 00:42:03.821
RISK IS OUT THERE WE COULD FIND

00:42:03.888 --> 00:42:05.022
OURSELVES IN A VERY CHALLENGING

00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:07.324
SITUATION IF WE WERE TO LOSE

00:42:07.391 --> 00:42:09.560
THAT LAWSUIT. I THINK THE

00:42:09.627 --> 00:42:10.561
OUTCOME WOULD BE MOORED

00:42:10.628 --> 00:42:12.062
DISAGREEABLE TO EVERYONE

00:42:12.129 --> 00:42:13.230
INVOLVED WE WOULD BASICALLY BE

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:14.732
IN A SITUATION WHERE.

00:42:14.798 --> 00:42:17.768
WE WOULD HAVE DIFFICULTY.

00:42:17.835 --> 00:42:19.103
CLEANING THESE FACILITIES AND

00:42:19.169 --> 00:42:21.005
WE MAY RUN INTO ISSUES WITH THE

00:42:21.071 --> 00:42:22.039
FEDERAL COURTS THEIR OVERSEEING.

00:42:22.106 --> 00:42:23.974
.

00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:24.308
OUR MEDICAL.

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:25.976
IN MAY MEDICAL PROGRAM SO THAT

00:42:26.043 --> 00:42:27.011
WOULD BE AN ISSUE THE OTHER

00:42:27.077 --> 00:42:28.612
ISSUE IS WE WOULD HAVE TO

00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:30.347
TERMINATE THAT CONTRAST. OUGHT

00:42:30.414 --> 00:42:32.383
RATHER ABRUPTLY AND I THINK IN

00:42:32.449 --> 00:42:33.217
THAT CASE.

00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:35.853
THE CAREFUL PLANNING THAT WE

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.688
WOULD LIKE TO DO TO MAKE SURE AS

00:42:37.755 --> 00:42:39.156
MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE CAN BE

00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:40.858
TRANSITIONED INTO CIVIL SERVICE

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:41.792
WOULD SUDDENLY.

00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:43.560
GO OUT THE WINDOW WE HAVE TO DO

00:42:43.627 --> 00:42:45.562
THAT REALLY QUICKLY AND I THINK

00:42:45.629 --> 00:42:47.464
THE THE RISK OF DISPLACING

00:42:47.531 --> 00:42:48.432
WORKERS WOULD BE MUCH GREATER IN

00:42:48.499 --> 00:42:49.667
THAT SITUATION

00:42:49.733 --> 00:42:51.101
DO YOU NOT HAVE ATTORNEYS THAT

00:42:51.168 --> 00:42:52.336
WOULD BE CAPABLE CRAFTING

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:54.738
LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE HELP. IN

00:42:54.805 --> 00:42:56.540
LITIGATION PROVING.

00:42:56.607 --> 00:42:58.275
WHEREBY.

00:42:58.342 --> 00:42:59.777
THE STATE WOULD MORE LIKELY

00:42:59.843 --> 00:43:02.046
PREVAIL IN THE LAWSUIT.

00:43:02.112 --> 00:43:03.380
BUT WE HAVE ATTORNEYS CAPABLE OF

00:43:03.447 --> 00:43:05.182
DRAFTING LANGUAGE THAT YOU COULD

00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:05.716
PRESENT TO THE CONFERENCE

00:43:05.783 --> 00:43:06.417
COMMITTEE.

00:43:06.483 --> 00:43:10.988
OF THAT SORT.

00:43:11.055 --> 00:43:12.323
I I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:43:12.389 --> 00:43:14.325
WE'RE ACTIVELY LOOKING INTO I

00:43:14.391 --> 00:43:17.661
THINK THE ISSUE IS THAT THE.

00:43:17.728 --> 00:43:20.831
ITS IS REALLY A CONSTITUTIONAL

00:43:20.898 --> 00:43:21.632

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:28.038
PROCESS AND SO.

00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:29.907
THE STATE IS IS PRETTY LIMITED

00:43:29.974 --> 00:43:32.276
IN TERMS OF CONTRACTING OUT SO I

00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:34.878
I THINK THE THE CONTRACTS WITH

00:43:34.945 --> 00:43:36.447
IN STATE LAW THAT PARTIALLY OR.

00:43:36.513 --> 00:43:38.148

CODE SECTION GOVERNMENT CODE

00:44:01.538 --> 00:44:02.873
SECTION.

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.608
ONE NINE ONE THREE ZERO OR ONE

00:44:04.675 --> 00:44:07.578
NINE FOUR ZERO FOUR.

00:44:07.644 --> 00:44:08.712
AT FAMILIAR WITH.

00:44:08.779 --> 00:44:11.348
ONE NINE ONE THREE ZERO THE

00:44:11.415 --> 00:44:12.783
OTHER CUTS ACTION A LESS SO TOP

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:13.951
MAN.

00:44:14.018 --> 00:44:14.284
SEEMS THAT.

00:44:14.351 --> 00:44:16.353
NINETEEN ONE THIRTY ALLOWS

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:17.788
PRIDE INDUSTRIES TO HAVE THE

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:20.257
CONTRACT SO I'M.

00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:21.625

00:44:23.794 --> 00:44:26.063
PARTICULAR CODE SECTION.

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:29.133
I THINK THE THAT INITIALLY THE

00:44:29.199 --> 00:44:31.201
CONTRACT WAS ENTERED INTO UNDER

00:44:31.268 --> 00:44:32.669
CLAUSE WITHIN GOVERNMENT COULD

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:34.004
ONE NINE ONE THREE ZERO WHICH

00:44:34.071 --> 00:44:36.407
ALLOWED FOR EMERGENCY CONTRACTS.

00:44:36.473 --> 00:44:38.642
THE ISSUE WAS THAT THE THE

00:44:38.709 --> 00:44:39.843
FEDERAL COURTS HAVE RAISED

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:41.278
ISSUES WITH THE.

00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:43.514
JANITORIAL SERVICES THAT THE

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:45.115
THESE FACILITY IN STOCKTON.

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:47.651
THERE WAS.

00:44:47.718 --> 00:44:49.920
THAT THE RECEIVER LOOKED AT THE

00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:51.055
SITUATION IN TERMS OF HOW TO

00:44:51.121 --> 00:44:53.123
PROCEED IN THERE WAS DIFFICULTY.

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:54.858
FINDING A CIVIL SERVICE SOLUTION

00:44:54.925 --> 00:44:56.894
IMMEDIATELY AND SO UNDER THOSE

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.629
SERVE EMERGENCY PROVISIONS I WAS

00:44:58.695 --> 00:45:00.197
ABLE TO GO OUT AND IN CONTRACT

00:45:00.264 --> 00:45:02.166
OUT FOR THESE SERVICES BUT. I

00:45:02.232 --> 00:45:04.601
THINK THE EMERGENCY PERIOD MAY

00:45:04.668 --> 00:45:05.169
HAVE PASSED AT THIS POINT.

00:45:05.235 --> 00:45:06.970
OKAY SO.

00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:08.572
CIVIL SERVANTS WORK DOING THE

00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:10.741
JOB WELL FEDERAL RECEIVER SAID.

00:45:10.808 --> 00:45:12.676
FIX IT.

00:45:12.743 --> 00:45:15.145
STATE HIRES PRIDE.

00:45:15.212 --> 00:45:17.247
WELL I THINK THE THE ISSUE

00:45:17.314 --> 00:45:18.649
WASN'T SURE THAT CIVIL SERVICE

00:45:18.715 --> 00:45:19.950
WASN'T DOING A GOOD JOB THERE

00:45:20.017 --> 00:45:21.685
WERE ONLY AT THAT TIME SIXTY

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:23.787
CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS AT THAT

00:45:23.854 --> 00:45:24.655
FACILITY.

00:45:24.721 --> 00:45:26.623
THAT FACILITY HAD HAD JUST BEEN

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.292
OPEN THEY WERE STAFFING OPEN THE

00:45:28.358 --> 00:45:29.193
ISSUE WAS THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO

00:45:29.259 --> 00:45:31.161
HIRE ENOUGH CIVIL SERVICE STAFF

00:45:31.228 --> 00:45:32.596
TO PROVIDE THE WHERE IT WASN'T.

00:45:32.663 --> 00:45:34.231
NECESSARILY AN ISSUE THAT THEY

00:45:34.298 --> 00:45:34.965
WEREN'T DOING IT ADEQUATELY.

00:45:35.032 --> 00:45:37.134
OKAY AND SO.

00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:38.702
THE FEDERAL RECEIVER'S DOWN TO

00:45:38.769 --> 00:45:39.470
WHAT IT'S NOW OF PRIDE IS THAT

00:45:39.536 --> 00:45:42.372
CORRECT.

00:45:42.439 --> 00:45:45.642
I NEED I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY HOW

00:45:45.709 --> 00:45:48.178
MANY AUDITS THAT DONORS THAT I'M

00:45:48.245 --> 00:45:49.513
ARE. EVER I'VE LEARNED THAT

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:50.914
THEY'VE DONE TO WATER RECEIVERS

00:45:50.981 --> 00:45:51.682
THAT TO WHAT IT GAVE THEM A

00:45:51.748 --> 00:45:52.883
CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH SO. I'M

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:54.718
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE

00:45:54.785 --> 00:45:56.687
URGENCY AND THE NEED OF THE

00:45:56.753 --> 00:45:58.622
FEDERAL SIEVERS FINE WITH THIS

00:45:58.689 --> 00:45:59.857
ORGANIZATION.

00:45:59.923 --> 00:46:00.491
AND WE JUST HAD TO ITEMS READY

00:46:00.557 --> 00:46:02.192
WE'RE LOOKING AT OUTSOURCING TO

00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:04.194
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WHIRLING

00:46:04.261 --> 00:46:07.664
ON ITEM FIVE.

00:46:07.731 --> 00:46:09.967
YOU KNOW SO SO. WHAT'S.

00:46:10.033 --> 00:46:11.435
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE HERE AND

00:46:11.502 --> 00:46:13.670
WHY WOULD WE NOT WANT TO

00:46:13.737 --> 00:46:15.672
ENCOURAGE MORE OUTSOURCING. WHEN

00:46:15.739 --> 00:46:17.407
THAT'S AB AB THAT'S A MANAGEMENT

00:46:17.474 --> 00:46:19.476
DECISION THAT SHOULD BE.

00:46:19.543 --> 00:46:21.645
PURSUED BECAUSE OF COST REASONS

00:46:21.712 --> 00:46:22.779
ITS ARAB.

00:46:22.846 --> 00:46:23.714
I'D I'D LIKE SOME CLEAR JUST

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.616
GOING BACK TO ISSUE TO ON HUMAN

00:46:25.682 --> 00:46:27.084
TRAFFICKING FUNDAMENTALLY THAT'S

00:46:27.151 --> 00:46:29.286
A MUCH DIFFERNT. RAM WE ARE

00:46:29.353 --> 00:46:30.821
THAT THE GRANT PROGRAM THAT'S

00:46:30.888 --> 00:46:32.789
GOING OUT TO NON PROFITS. THIS

00:46:32.856 --> 00:46:34.725
IS WORK THAT'S BEING CONDUCTED

00:46:34.791 --> 00:46:36.760
IN A FACILITY AND SO I DON'T

00:46:36.827 --> 00:46:38.328
THINK THAT THE COMPARISON IS

00:46:38.395 --> 00:46:39.096
APPROPRIATE BETWEEN THE TWO

00:46:39.163 --> 00:46:41.064
ITEMS CLIMB I DISAGREE MISS

00:46:41.131 --> 00:46:42.699
COSTA BECAUSE WE'RE HIRING

00:46:42.766 --> 00:46:44.034
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:45.269
DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED.

00:46:45.335 --> 00:46:46.970
AND WE HAVE NOW SOMEONE WHO'S

00:46:47.037 --> 00:46:48.238
PROVIDING THAT'S WHAT I'M

00:46:48.305 --> 00:46:49.139
THINKING FROM A COMPASSION

00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:51.308
STANDPOINT THIS IS.

00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:54.011
JUST A WONDERFUL THING TO DO.

00:48:49.526 --> 00:48:51.662
MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND.

00:48:51.728 --> 00:48:53.363
DANGEROUS WEAPONS IN THE HANDS

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:54.898
OF DANGEROUS PEOPLE THAT FOR

00:48:54.965 --> 00:48:56.300
YEARS THIS BACKLOG HAS

00:48:56.366 --> 00:48:58.502
LANGUISHED WELL WE.

00:48:58.568 --> 00:48:59.703
THE LEGEND SAYS A BUDGET

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:00.837
COMMITTEE IS THROWING MONEY.

00:49:00.904 --> 00:49:02.406

DIDN'T TO MAKE.

00:49:04.641 --> 00:49:06.343
FAR FROM SATISFACTORY.

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:09.046
PROGRESS.

00:49:09.112 --> 00:49:10.981
ONE OF THE RATIONALES WERE THAT

00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:12.449
BECAUSE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL

00:49:12.516 --> 00:49:13.850
CANNOT.

00:49:13.917 --> 00:49:15.852
PAY THE SALARIES.

00:49:15.919 --> 00:49:18.789
COMPARABLE TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:20.057
THAT'S WHY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN

00:49:20.123 --> 00:49:21.158
ABLE TO HIRE ENOUGH PEOPLE TO DO

00:49:21.224 --> 00:49:22.559
THIS FOR THE MONEY THAT THE

00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:23.827
STATE HAS GIVEN THEM WE HAVE

00:49:23.894 --> 00:49:25.462
ACTUALLY I UNDERSTAND THEY

00:49:25.529 --> 00:49:26.830

PRODUCTIVE MEETING I FELT WITH

00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:33.804
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HE

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:36.206
COMMITTED TO ME TO COME TO US

00:49:36.273 --> 00:49:38.041
WITH A PLAN.

00:49:38.108 --> 00:49:39.443
OF HOW THEY WILL UTILIZE

00:49:39.509 --> 00:49:40.777
WHATEVER RESOURCES WE HAVE

00:49:40.844 --> 00:49:43.013
PROVIDED THEM.

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.047
AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

00:49:44.114 --> 00:49:45.949
PROVIDED THEM.

00:49:46.016 --> 00:49:47.217
HOW WHAT IS YOUR PLAN TO BOOK

00:49:47.284 --> 00:49:48.385
WORK DOWN THAT?

00:49:48.452 --> 00:49:50.787
BACK WHILE.

00:49:50.854 --> 00:49:53.857
AND I ASSUMED IT WOULD INCLUDE.

00:49:53.924 --> 00:49:54.624
HOW THEY WOULD SECURE THE

00:49:54.691 --> 00:49:55.359
INDIVIDUALS

00:49:55.425 --> 00:49:57.794
TO DO THIS?

00:49:57.861 --> 00:49:59.463
SO FAR I IT WOULDN'T THEY HAVE

00:49:59.529 --> 00:50:01.498
NOT PRESENTED THAT INFORMATION

00:50:01.565 --> 00:50:02.632
TO US SO IT'S CERTAINLY

00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:04.534
PREMATURE.

00:50:04.601 --> 00:50:05.769

THE MANY MORE MONEY.

00:50:07.137 --> 00:50:08.405

00:50:08.472 --> 00:50:09.773
THE CASE NEXT WEEK AS WELL AS IT

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.274

00:50:11.341 --> 00:50:12.809
SO WHY DO I THINK THIS IS

00:50:12.876 --> 00:50:14.344
SOMETHING WE NEED TO TALK A LOT

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:15.912

00:53:15.058 --> 00:53:16.026
TALK ABOUT THE LOCAL EVENTS HERE

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:17.127
IN SACRAMENTO I THINK THOSE ARE

00:53:17.193 --> 00:53:19.429
PEOPLE WHO WERE GUNNED DOWN BY

00:53:19.496 --> 00:53:20.463
POLICE WHO WERE FOUND TO BE

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:22.566
UNARMED.

00:53:22.632 --> 00:53:23.800
SO I WOULD JUST BE SUGGEST WE

00:53:23.867 --> 00:53:24.834
ALL BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE

00:53:24.901 --> 00:53:26.269
LANGUAGE WE USE.

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:28.638
AND PERHAPS TO SEE THESE TWO

00:53:28.705 --> 00:53:30.974
ISSUE ITEMS.

00:53:31.041 --> 00:53:32.142
SEPARATE AS THEY WERE PRESENTED

00:53:32.208 --> 00:53:37.514
IN THE AGENDA.

00:53:37.581 --> 00:53:38.548
VINCENT ABOUT THROUGH CHAIR I

00:53:38.615 --> 00:53:40.250
APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION.

00:53:40.317 --> 00:53:42.252
MY CONCERN IS.

00:53:42.319 --> 00:53:44.087
THINKING THAT IF I DON'T KNOW IF

00:53:44.154 --> 00:53:45.555
A PERSON IS ARMED.

00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:49.726
I'M THINKING THAT IT MIGHT BE A.

00:53:49.793 --> 00:53:51.227
COMPONENT OF WHAT'S GOING ON

00:53:51.294 --> 00:53:52.329
BECAUSE I ONCE I WANT THIS TO

00:53:52.395 --> 00:53:53.697
STOP.

00:53:53.763 --> 00:53:56.333
BUT IT DOESN'T HELP IF POLICE

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:57.500
OFFICERS KNOW THAT THERE ARE A

00:53:57.567 --> 00:53:58.902
LOT OF GUNS OUT THERE THAT

00:53:58.969 --> 00:54:00.437
SHOULDN'T BE OUT THERE. AND AND

00:54:00.503 --> 00:54:01.471
I THINK THIS NEEDS TO BE

00:54:01.538 --> 00:54:03.173
ADDRESSED. AND IT JUST SEEMS

00:54:03.239 --> 00:54:04.708
THAT THAT THAT THE INVENTORY IS

00:54:04.774 --> 00:54:06.843
NOT MOVING DOWN. PASSING OF

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:07.777
CYPRESS SHAPE.

00:54:07.844 --> 00:54:09.546
SENATOR ROSS RECOMMENDATION OF A

00:54:09.613 --> 00:54:11.481
PLAN. BECAUSE IF WE LOOK AT

00:54:11.548 --> 00:54:13.049
THINGS MAYBE THERE IS SOMETHING

00:54:13.116 --> 00:54:15.051
THAT'S ADDING TO OUR MUTUAL

00:54:15.118 --> 00:54:17.554
FRUSTRATION.

00:54:17.621 --> 00:54:18.388
AND THAT'S WHY ARE OUR GAS FOR

00:54:18.455 --> 00:54:19.456
THE CORRELATION I APPRECIATE

00:54:19.522 --> 00:54:20.790
THAT I THINK THAT THERE ARE.

00:54:20.857 --> 00:54:22.959
A VARIETY OF ISSUES PERHAPS

00:54:23.026 --> 00:54:24.461
THAT BUTTON THAT NEITHER YOU OR

00:54:24.527 --> 00:54:27.063
I ARE COMPLETELY VERSED IN. ON

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:27.764
THAT THAT.

00:54:27.831 --> 00:54:30.433
ARE ATTRIBUTING TO THE

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:32.869
INCREASED INCIDENCE OF.

00:54:32.936 --> 00:54:35.305

00:54:35.372 --> 00:54:38.108
VERTICALLY OF THOSE ON A VICTIMS

00:54:38.174 --> 00:54:39.809
WHO ARE UNARMED SO I WOULD JUST

00:54:39.876 --> 00:54:41.177
BE CAREFUL AS WE TRY TO DRAW

00:54:41.244 --> 00:54:42.646
CORRELATION THAT WE DON'T

00:54:42.712 --> 00:54:43.647
NECESSARILY KNOW THAT THERE IS A

00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:45.749
CONNECTION. AND BECAUSE A LOT

00:54:45.815 --> 00:54:47.250
SAY BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEX

00:54:47.317 --> 00:54:47.751
THINGS I'D LIKE TO SEE.

00:54:47.817 --> 00:54:48.852
IF THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

00:54:48.918 --> 00:54:51.721
COMPONENTS OF THIS.

00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:53.456
PHENOMENON THAT WERE SEEN THAT

00:54:53.523 --> 00:54:54.691

JUST FOR SOME CONTEXT THIS

WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO I WAS

00:59:47.684 --> 00:59:48.551
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THEY SHOULD

SENATE REJECTED THE

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:30.098
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. AYE

01:19:30.165 --> 01:19:32.467
WE RECOMMEND THE SENATE ACTION

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:33.502
OUT THERE ARE CURRENTLY CAP AND

01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:34.836
TRADE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THESE

01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:35.570

01:19:43.545 --> 01:19:45.080
THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS

01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:46.381
IMPLEMENTING AND THE CURRENT

01:19:51.253 --> 01:19:52.220
SO I THINK IT MAKES SENSE TO LET

AUTHORED. LEGISLATION AB EIGHT

01:22:42.357 --> 01:22:43.358
OR NINE THAT IMPOSE A

01:22:43.425 --> 01:22:45.794
REQUIREMENT FOR TRANSPARENCY IN

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:47.228
BALLOT LABELING FOR TAX

01:22:47.295 --> 01:22:48.029
INCREASES AND WHAT IT DID IS

01:22:48.096 --> 01:22:50.432
REQUIRE. THAT OF A TAX INCREASE

01:22:50.498 --> 01:22:51.266
APPEARS ON A BALLOT FOR VOTER

APPROVAL YOU HAVE TO CLEARLY

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.902
STATE THAT IS A TAX INCREASE WE

01:22:53.968 --> 01:22:55.003
HAVE TO STATE THE RATE OF THE

01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:56.604
TAX AT THE RATIO OF THE TAXES IS

01:22:56.671 --> 01:22:58.473
AUTHORIZED. I HAVE TO BE RIGHT

01:22:58.540 --> 01:22:59.708
THERE ON THE BALLOT LABEL NOT

01:22:59.774 --> 01:23:00.909
BURIED IN THE VOTER INFORMATION

01:23:00.975 --> 01:23:02.110
PAMPHLET SO THAT PASSED WITH

01:23:02.177 --> 01:23:03.411
BIPARTISAN SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:04.946
SIGNED IT. AND EVERY YEAR SINCE

01:23:05.013 --> 01:23:06.047
THEN I'VE AUTHORED CLEAN UP

01:23:06.114 --> 01:23:07.315
LEGISLATION THAT FIXES LITTLE

01:23:07.382 --> 01:23:08.683
IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEMS THAT

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:09.551
HAVE ARISEN.

01:23:09.617 --> 01:23:10.952
SO LAST YEAR TO CLEAN UP BILL

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:13.588
WAS AB ONE NINETY FIVE AND AMONG

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:14.923
OTHER THINGS IT ANSWERED THE

01:23:14.989 --> 01:23:16.991
QUESTION OF IF A BALLOT IF A

01:23:17.058 --> 01:23:18.293
BOND MEASURE.

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.894
APPEARS ON THE BALLOT FOR VOTER

01:23:19.961 --> 01:23:21.830
APPROVAL IS THAT BOND MEASURE

01:23:21.896 --> 01:23:23.598
ALSO SUBJECT TO THOSE

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:25.200
TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS AND AB

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:27.335
ONE NINETY FIVE SAID YES. IF IT

01:23:27.402 --> 01:23:29.170
RAISES PROPERTY TAXES YOU DO

01:23:29.237 --> 01:23:31.039
HAVE TO MAKE THOSE DISCLOSURES.

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:32.707
THAT WAS VERY UNCONTROVERSIAL

01:23:32.774 --> 01:23:33.942
THE BILL HAD NO OPPOSITION I

01:23:34.008 --> 01:23:35.009
DON'T THINK I GOT A SINGLE NO

01:23:35.076 --> 01:23:36.711
VOTE IN EITHER CHAMBER IN THE

01:23:36.778 --> 01:23:38.012
GOVERNOR SIGNED IT SO. SINCE

01:23:38.079 --> 01:23:39.080
THEN A COUPLE OF THE

01:23:39.147 --> 01:23:41.249
ORGANIZATIONS ON THE LETTER THAT

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:42.650
I'M SURE EVERYONE'S RECEIVED.

01:23:42.717 --> 01:23:44.052
HAVE COME FORWARD WITH SOME

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:45.987
CONCERNS ABOUT THE WORDING OF AB

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:47.789
ONE NINETY FIVE AND THE CONCERNS

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:49.023
THAT THEY HAVE WORK ARE VERY

01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:50.558
VALID THERE ASKING QUESTIONS

01:23:50.625 --> 01:23:53.228
LIKE WHAT HAPPENS IF THE RATE OF

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:54.629
THE BOND IS NOT KNOWN.

01:23:54.696 --> 01:23:56.965
EXACTLY WHEN THE BOND ISSUES PUT

01:23:57.031 --> 01:23:59.534
ON THE BALLOT WHAT IF IT'S TIED

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:00.835
TO SOMETHING LIKE LIVE MORE.

01:24:00.902 --> 01:24:02.804
WHAT IF THE?

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:04.539
RATE OF THE TAX THAT HAS TO BE

01:24:04.606 --> 01:24:06.007
CHARGED AGAINST PROPERTY IS

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:06.508
DEPENDENT ON THE OVERALL

01:24:06.574 --> 01:24:08.410
EVALUATION.

01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:09.544
OF THE ENTIRE DISTRICT YOU KNOW

01:24:09.611 --> 01:24:10.745
IF I CAN GO UP OR DOWN WE DON'T

01:24:10.812 --> 01:24:11.913
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS WE HAVE TO

01:24:11.980 --> 01:24:13.381
ESTIMATED WHAT ABOUT THAT SO

01:24:13.448 --> 01:24:14.549
THOSE THINGS I THINK ARE VERY

01:24:14.616 --> 01:24:15.884
VALID SO I I AUTHORED.

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:17.118
LEGISLATION THIS YEAR JUST IN

01:24:17.185 --> 01:24:19.521
JANUARY AB TWENTY NINE FORTY

01:24:19.587 --> 01:24:20.989
EIGHT I THINK IT IS.

01:24:21.055 --> 01:24:22.590
THAT WOULD ADDRESS THOSE

01:24:22.657 --> 01:24:24.259
PROBLEMS BUT IN MY NEGOTIATION

01:24:24.325 --> 01:24:25.894
WITH THESE GROUPS IT'S BECOME

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:26.561
VERY CLEAR THAT WHAT THEY REALLY

01:24:26.628 --> 01:24:28.963
WANT. IS TO NOT HAVE TO TELL

01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:30.865
VOTERS THAT APPROVAL OF A BOND

01:24:30.932 --> 01:24:32.901
WILL INCREASE THEIR PROPERTY TAX.

01:24:32.967 --> 01:24:34.369
AND THAT'S BEEN A STICKY ISSUE

01:24:34.436 --> 01:24:35.236
FOR US BECAUSE IT'S NOT

01:24:35.303 --> 01:24:37.372
SOMETHING THAT I AM WILLING TO

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:38.540
DO I WANT TO FIX THE

01:24:38.606 --> 01:24:39.340
IMPLEMENTATION PROBLEMS  DON'T

01:24:39.407 --> 01:24:40.842
WANT TO GET RID. OF THE

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:41.643
REQUIREMENT TO DISCLOSE.

01:24:41.709 --> 01:24:44.546
SO.

01:24:44.612 --> 01:24:45.480
THAT BRINGS US TO TODAY ARE

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:46.514
THEY'RE TRYING TO DO AN END RUN

01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:48.650
AROUND THE LEGISLATURE AND PASS

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:49.984
THIS THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS

01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:51.886
A COMPLETE EXEMPTION.

01:24:51.953 --> 01:24:53.755
FORM THE REQUIREMENT THAT THEY

01:24:53.822 --> 01:24:55.256
DO ANY KIND OF DISCLOSURE WHEN

01:24:55.323 --> 01:24:57.192
THEY PUT A BOND ON THE BALLOT.

01:24:57.258 --> 01:24:59.027
DAY I'M SURE SENT ALL OF YOUR

01:24:59.093 --> 01:24:59.828
LETTER THE TO TO PROBABLY OF

01:24:59.894 --> 01:25:01.296
READ AND I JUST WANT TO TAKE A

01:25:01.362 --> 01:25:03.164
MINUTE AND DEBUNK SOME OF THE

01:25:03.231 --> 01:25:05.033
THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID. A

01:25:05.099 --> 01:25:06.568
ABOUT THIS ISSUE FIRST OF ALL

01:25:06.634 --> 01:25:07.635
ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE HEARD IS

01:25:07.702 --> 01:25:09.671
THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR BOND

01:25:09.737 --> 01:25:11.239
MEASURES TO COMPLY. WITH THE

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:12.540
REQUIREMENTS OF AB ONE NINETY

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:14.008
FIVE AND THAT IS COMPLETELY

01:25:14.075 --> 01:25:15.944
FALSE THERE HAVE BEEN. NUMEROUS

01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:17.545
POSITIVE INPUT ON THE BALLOT IN

01:25:17.612 --> 01:25:18.913
THE LAST YEAR SINCE ONE NINETY

01:25:18.980 --> 01:25:20.582
FOUR NINETY FIVE WAS SIGNED THAT

01:25:20.648 --> 01:25:22.183
HAVE LANGUAGE THAT.

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:23.151
THAT COMPLIES GOING TO PASS

01:25:23.218 --> 01:25:25.053
THIS AROUND IF YOU WANNA TAKE A

01:25:25.119 --> 01:25:26.454
LOOK THIS IS JUST A FEW OF THEM.

01:25:26.521 --> 01:25:27.789
YOU CAN READ THROUGH THE

01:25:27.856 --> 01:25:29.224
LANGUAGE IT'S A LITTLE WORDY BUT

01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:30.024
AND AND I THINK TWENTY EIGHT

01:25:30.091 --> 01:25:31.793
NINETY FIVE OR TWENTY NINE FORTY

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:32.894
EIGHT THAT WERE DOING THIS YEAR.

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:34.362
WOULD FIX WITHOUT BUT IT

01:25:34.429 --> 01:25:36.431
CERTAINLY IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE

01:25:36.498 --> 01:25:38.333
ANOTHER ONE OF THE ASSERTIONS AS

01:25:38.399 --> 01:25:39.634
THAT IT'S CONFUSING TO VOTERS

01:25:39.701 --> 01:25:40.935
AND WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THE

01:25:41.002 --> 01:25:42.103
FACT IF YOU READ LANGUAGE. IT'S

01:25:42.170 --> 01:25:43.671
NOT CONFUSING TO VOTERS IT'S

01:25:43.738 --> 01:25:45.206
CONFUSING TO BOND LAWYERS WHAT

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:46.074
THE EXACT DISCLOSURE

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:47.242
REQUIREMENTS ARE THAT'S WHAT

01:25:47.308 --> 01:25:48.743
WE'RE TRYING TO FIX.

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:49.244
BUT IT THERE'S NO VOTER

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.878
CONFUSION.

01:25:49.944 --> 01:25:52.080
.

01:25:52.146 --> 01:25:52.647
ANOTHER THING THAT THEY'RE

01:25:52.714 --> 01:25:53.815
CRITICIZING IS THAT THEY'RE

01:25:53.882 --> 01:25:55.416
SPENDING A THIRD OF THE WORDS ON

01:25:55.483 --> 01:25:57.151
THE BALLOT LABEL.

01:25:57.218 --> 01:25:58.853
ONE THE DISCLOSURE LANGUAGE AND

01:25:58.920 --> 01:25:59.854
THAT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD LIKE

01:25:59.921 --> 01:26:01.656
TO REDUCE ACTUALLY SO I'M

01:26:01.723 --> 01:26:03.358
WORKING TO IT TO GET THAT. TO TO

01:26:03.424 --> 01:26:04.492
BE LOWER BUT EVEN IF IT IS A

01:26:04.559 --> 01:26:06.327
THIRD THEIR SPENDING TWO THIRDS

01:26:06.394 --> 01:26:07.662
OF THE BALLOT LABEL TELLING

01:26:07.729 --> 01:26:08.329
ABOUT ALL THE GOOD THINGS THAT

01:26:08.396 --> 01:26:10.098
BOND DOES THAT A THIRD TALKING

01:26:10.164 --> 01:26:11.699
ABOUT. WHAT THE BOND ACTUALLY

01:26:11.766 --> 01:26:13.401
COSTS SO I DON'T THINK THAT

01:26:13.468 --> 01:26:16.004
THAT'S OF A BAD COMPROMISE AND

01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.838
AND THIS THE CLIP I CAN'T

01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:17.472
BELIEVE THAT THEY PUT THIS IN

01:26:17.539 --> 01:26:19.307
THEIR LETTER? BUT I ONE OF THE

01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:20.408
THINGS THAT THEY'RE CRITICIZING

01:26:20.475 --> 01:26:22.377
IS THAT THEY'VE DONE POLLING AND

01:26:22.443 --> 01:26:25.013
DECIDED THAT SOME OF THE BONDS

01:26:25.079 --> 01:26:25.446
THAT THEY WANT. TO.

01:26:25.513 --> 01:26:26.180
.

01:26:26.247 --> 01:26:27.649
YOU PUT ON THE BALLOT ARE LESS

01:26:27.715 --> 01:26:28.750
LIKELY TO PASS IF THEY MAKE THE

01:26:28.816 --> 01:26:30.084
DISCLOSURE.

01:26:30.151 --> 01:26:31.386
SO THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND

01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:32.921
THERE SAYING VOTERS MIGHT NOT

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:34.355
VOTE FOR THE BOND IF THEY KNEW

01:26:34.422 --> 01:26:36.190
WHAT THEY WERE VOTING ON.

01:26:36.257 --> 01:26:38.660
WHICH I THINK IT IS A RIDICULOUS

01:26:38.726 --> 01:26:39.861
REASON TOOK TO NOT DO THE SCHOOL

01:26:39.928 --> 01:26:40.428
DISCLOSURE BUT IF YOU THINK

01:26:40.495 --> 01:26:42.063
ABOUT THAT YOU THINK ABOUT IT

01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:42.730
DOES MAKE A THE BAR A LITTLE BIT

01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:44.299
HIGHER. IF YOU HAVE TO MAKE A

01:26:44.365 --> 01:26:46.134
DISCLOSURE BUT MANY BONDS HAVE

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.669
PASSED WITH THE DISCLOSURE IN

01:26:47.735 --> 01:26:49.837
THERE AND I THINK IT'S JUST FAIR

01:26:49.904 --> 01:26:51.239
THAT VOTERS KNOW BOTH THE GOOD

01:26:51.306 --> 01:26:52.373
AND THE BAD OF WHAT THEY'RE

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.208
VOTING ON THE NEED TO KNOW. WHAT

01:26:54.275 --> 01:26:56.344
THE BOND WILL DO? AND THEY DID

01:26:56.411 --> 01:26:56.978
YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:57.779
THEM.

01:26:57.845 --> 01:26:59.814
AND. THE LAST THING I WANTED TO

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:01.282
ADDRESS IS THAT THE CLAIM IS

01:27:01.349 --> 01:27:02.216
THAT THE REASON WHY WE HAVE TO

01:27:02.283 --> 01:27:04.052
DO THIS IN THE BUDGET.

01:27:04.118 --> 01:27:06.154
IS IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GET THIS

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:08.523
ISSUE FIXED BEFORE THE BOND

01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:09.757
MEASURES GO ON THE BALLOT FOR

01:27:09.824 --> 01:27:11.259
THE NOVEMBER ELECTION.

01:27:11.326 --> 01:27:12.160
AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

01:27:12.226 --> 01:27:13.261
I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM FOR

01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:14.662
FIVE MONTHS NOW ALREADY ON

01:27:14.729 --> 01:27:16.331
SOLUTION. YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:27:16.397 --> 01:27:17.532
TRYING TO DO AN END RUN AROUND

01:27:17.599 --> 01:27:18.866
HERE WHICH IS YOU KNOW IT'S THAT

01:27:18.933 --> 01:27:20.401
THAT'S THEIR RIGHT. BUT ARE WE

01:27:20.468 --> 01:27:22.036

AMENDED THE LANGUAGE I THINK WE

01:27:28.509 --> 01:27:30.144

01:27:30.211 --> 01:27:31.879

OF AB SIX IN THE SENATE AND

01:28:20.094 --> 01:28:21.029
I JUST I WAS GONNA MOVE FORWARD

01:28:21.095 --> 01:28:21.663
WITH SOMETHING WHERE I'M TRYING

01:28:21.729 --> 01:28:23.364
TO HELP PEOPLE AND THEY'RE GOING

01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:24.732
TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO BE

01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:26.367
IN A COMMITTEE RIGHT SO.

01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:28.503

01:28:29.103 --> 01:28:31.639
AND I THINK IT COULD BE DONE

01:28:31.706 --> 01:28:32.740
VERY AYE EXPEDITIOUSLY.

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:40.181
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

01:28:40.248 --> 01:28:42.150
BOB DYLAN AT JUST ONE I I I

01:28:42.216 --> 01:28:43.951
THINK AS FAR AS THE POLLSTERS

01:28:44.018 --> 01:28:45.520
SAID ARE CONCERNED DUH. I THINK

01:28:45.586 --> 01:28:46.521
THE CONCERN RELATES MORE TO

01:28:46.587 --> 01:28:47.955
VOTER CONFUSION THAT IT DOES TO

01:28:48.022 --> 01:28:50.158
VOTER UNDERSTANDING. OF THE KIND

01:28:50.224 --> 01:28:52.794
OF LANGUAGE THAT TOOK A THAT WE

01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:55.396
SEE HERE. I'M I THINK CAN FAIRLY

01:28:55.463 --> 01:28:56.831
BE INTERPRETED TO BE A CONFUSING

01:28:56.898 --> 01:28:57.999
THE VOTERS IT'S ONE OF THE

01:28:58.066 --> 01:28:59.400
REASONS THAT WE HAVE VOTER

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:01.335
PAMPHLETS THAT EXPLAINED WHAT

01:29:01.402 --> 01:29:03.638
BALLOT MEASURES ARE ALL ABOUT IN

01:29:03.705 --> 01:29:04.972
GREAT DETAIL.

01:29:05.039 --> 01:29:05.306
AND THE.

01:29:05.406 --> 01:29:06.774
.

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:08.976
LANGUAGE IN THE BALLOT ITSELF

01:29:09.043 --> 01:29:14.615
IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SUMMARY.

01:29:14.682 --> 01:29:15.917
DON'T KNOW THAT IF I COULD

01:29:15.983 --> 01:29:17.518
ADDRESS THAT I. WE INTEND TO

01:29:17.585 --> 01:29:18.586
MAKE IT A SUMMARY BUT WE ARE WE

01:29:18.653 --> 01:29:19.187
DON'T WANT TO CONFUSE ANYBODY

01:29:19.253 --> 01:29:21.022
BUT ONE THING THAT I DON'T WANT

01:29:21.089 --> 01:29:21.255
TO DO.

01:29:21.322 --> 01:29:22.790
IS

01:29:22.857 --> 01:29:25.093
TO AVOID SAYING TO PEOPLE THIS

01:29:25.159 --> 01:29:26.327
WILL INCREASE YOUR PROPERTY

01:29:26.394 --> 01:29:28.763
TXES IF YOU VOTE FOR THIS BOND.

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.264
THAT'S A THAT'S THAT'S REALLY

01:29:30.331 --> 01:29:31.866
THE STICKY ISSUE AND AND THE

01:29:31.933 --> 01:29:32.533
OTHER THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:33.935
THE RATE OF THE BOND AND THINGS

01:29:34.001 --> 01:29:35.169

INFORMATION PAMPHLET.

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:39.640
AND THE TAX RATE STATEMENT BUT.

01:29:39.707 --> 01:29:41.275
I THINK IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT

01:29:41.342 --> 01:29:42.577
THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT NOT TO

01:29:42.643 --> 01:29:43.945
DISGUISE THE FACT THAT IT IS A

01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:47.915
TAX INCREASE.

01:29:47.982 --> 01:29:49.016
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MOVE ON

BY THE SENATE OR THE GOVERNOR.

01:30:04.966 --> 01:30:06.267
OF THE LANGUAGE WOULD.

01:30:06.334 --> 01:30:08.002
SPECIFY HOW COUNTIES ARE

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:09.203
ELIGIBLE TO STICK TO ACQUIRE THE

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:13.274
FUNDS.

01:30:13.341 --> 01:30:14.475
PAST THANK YOU WE SUPPORT THE

01:30:14.542 --> 01:30:15.143
SENATE VERSION I JUST KNOW THAT

01:30:15.209 --> 01:30:16.043
WHEN WE BUILT THIS PROPOSAL WE

01:30:16.110 --> 01:30:17.812
INCLUDED AN ESTIMATE FOR THE ONE

01:30:17.879 --> 01:30:19.347
HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR POINT

01:30:23.751 --> 01:30:25.052
FIFTY PERCENT OF THE ESTIMATED

01:30:25.119 --> 01:30:27.455

01:30:35.663 --> 01:30:36.898
PROBLEM WITH THE ASSEMBLY

01:30:36.964 --> 01:30:38.666
VERSION OF THIS ITEM IS THAT

01:30:38.733 --> 01:30:40.101
SOME OF THE ITEMS WILL LIKELY

01:30:40.168 --> 01:30:41.836
INCREASE COST BEYOND WHAT WE'VE

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:43.871
BUDGETED FOR THIS.

01:30:43.938 --> 01:30:44.372

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

01:30:53.948 --> 01:30:56.150
OBVIOUSLY WOULD SHIFT COSTS IN A

01:30:56.217 --> 01:30:57.552
DIFFERENT WAY WHICH WE HAVE BEEN

01:30:57.618 --> 01:30:59.453

01:31:13.301 --> 01:31:15.069
THAT WE SHOULD NOT JUST ASSUME

01:31:15.136 --> 01:31:17.405

01:37:58.606 --> 01:37:59.440
HOUSES IS THAT THE ASSEMBLY

01:37:59.506 --> 01:38:01.408
PROPOSES.

01:38:01.475 --> 01:38:03.310
TO TIE A THAT A ONE THOUSAND

01:38:03.377 --> 01:38:04.712
DOLLAR DIFFERENTIAL TO THOSE

01:38:04.778 --> 01:38:06.247
INSTITUTIONS.

01:38:06.313 --> 01:38:08.482
ADMITTING MORE COMEDIC COLLEGE

01:38:08.549 --> 01:38:10.117
TRANSFER STUDENTS OR PROVIDING

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:11.819
MORE INSTITUTIONAL AID.

01:38:11.885 --> 01:38:14.221
OF FOR CAL GRANT STUDENTS THE

01:38:14.288 --> 01:38:15.656
SENATE ADULT JUST DID NOT ADOPT

01:38:15.723 --> 01:38:16.924
SUCH EXPECTATIONS ARE TO THAT

01:38:16.991 --> 01:38:19.293
THOUSAND DOLLARS DIFFERENTIAL.

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.462
FOR SOME CONTEXT ARM THE BOTH

01:38:21.528 --> 01:38:23.631
HOUSES ALSO PROVIDED A SIMILAR

01:38:23.697 --> 01:38:25.299
WORD AMOUNT FOR THE NONPROFIT

01:38:25.366 --> 01:38:27.134
INSTITUTIONS AND BOTH HOUSES AND

01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:28.902
THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED.

01:38:28.969 --> 01:38:31.872
TO A TIE THAT THOUSAND DOLLAR

01:38:31.939 --> 01:38:32.706
DIFFERENTIAL TO THE TO THE

01:38:32.773 --> 01:38:34.775
NONPROFIT SECTOR ADMITTING A

01:38:34.842 --> 01:38:36.443
CERTAIN NUMBER OF STUDENTS WITH

01:38:36.510 --> 01:38:39.179
AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER.

01:38:39.246 --> 01:38:40.781
WE RECOMMEND GOING WITH THE

01:38:40.848 --> 01:38:43.717
SENATE ON THIS ACTION.

01:38:43.784 --> 01:38:44.618
THE ASSEMBLY WAS TRYING TO DO

01:38:44.685 --> 01:38:46.487
WHICH WAS TO TREAT THESE FOR

01:38:46.553 --> 01:38:48.088
PROFIT INSTITUTIONS THE WAY BOTH

01:38:48.155 --> 01:38:49.590
HOUSES ARE TREATING. OTHER

01:38:49.657 --> 01:38:51.325
NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS

01:38:51.392 --> 01:38:53.327
BUT THE TO THE CHALLENGE HERE IS

01:38:53.394 --> 01:38:56.930
THAT THE NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS.

01:38:56.997 --> 01:39:00.567
HAVE A BODY THAT.

01:39:00.634 --> 01:39:02.069
REPRESENTS THEM IT HAS

01:39:02.136 --> 01:39:03.404
COMMITTED TO TO HELP COORDINATE

01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:04.204
THEIR ACTIVITIES WE WE WEREN'T

01:39:04.271 --> 01:39:04.872
AWARE OF SUCH A BODY THAT WOULD

01:39:04.938 --> 01:39:05.439
DO THIS FOR THE FOR PROFIT

01:39:05.506 --> 01:39:06.206
INSTITUTIONS.

01:39:06.273 --> 01:39:06.707
WE THINK IT'S ALL MORE

01:39:06.774 --> 01:39:07.241
CHALLENGING TO TREAT THEM

01:39:07.308 --> 01:39:08.842
EXACTLY THE SAME.

01:39:08.909 --> 01:39:10.277
AND IT ONE ONE.

01:39:10.344 --> 01:39:12.012
OPTION YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IS

01:39:12.079 --> 01:39:13.714
TO IS TO IT TAXIS EXPECTATIONS

01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:15.015
ARE ABOUT THE INSTITUTION LEVEL

01:39:15.082 --> 01:39:16.617
RATHER THAN THE SECTOR LEVEL BUT

01:39:16.684 --> 01:39:17.918
THEN AGAIN YOU'RE NOT. THAT THAT

01:39:17.985 --> 01:39:18.952
WOULDN'T EXACTLY TREATING THEM

01:39:19.019 --> 01:39:19.586
THE SAME WAY YOU'RE TREATING THE

01:39:19.653 --> 01:39:21.455
NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS FOR THAT

01:39:21.522 --> 01:39:30.597
REASON WE WE COULD WE CAN THINK

01:39:30.664 --> 01:39:31.198
OF ARE WE COULDN'T CERTIFICATE

01:39:31.265 --> 01:39:31.999
THAT.

01:39:32.066 --> 01:39:33.000
THANK YOU WE DON'T SUPPORT

CREATES.

THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU PERTAINS TO

01:39:57.958 --> 01:39:59.460
THREE RESEARCH PROPOSALS ADOPTED

ON THE FIRST ISSUE FOUR SEVEN

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:13.907
AND A HALF MILLION FOR OPIOID

01:40:13.974 --> 01:40:15.476
RESEARCH WE UNDERSTAND THE

01:40:15.542 --> 01:40:16.477
PURPOSE OF THIS FUNDING AS

01:40:16.543 --> 01:40:19.046
PRIMARILY TO RETRAIN PHYSICIANS.

01:40:19.113 --> 01:40:21.682
ON A MANAGING PAIN A USING

01:40:21.749 --> 01:40:23.016
ALTERNATIVE METHODS OTHER THAN

01:40:23.083 --> 01:40:28.756
PRESCRIBING OPIOIDS.

01:40:28.822 --> 01:40:30.457
I'M I DISHED UP A PORTION OF THE

01:40:30.524 --> 01:40:31.125
FUNDS ARE ALSO BE AVAILABLE FOR

01:40:31.191 --> 01:40:31.992
RESEARCHING ALTERNATIVE

01:40:32.059 --> 01:40:34.161
PRACTICES AS WELL.

01:40:34.228 --> 01:40:35.062
EXPERTS HAVE IDENTIFIED A

01:40:35.129 --> 01:40:36.897
RETRAINING PHYSICIANS AS ONE.

01:40:36.964 --> 01:40:37.698
BUT STEP THAT THE STATE COULD

01:40:37.765 --> 01:40:39.333
TAKE TO ADDRESS THE BROADER OPI

01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:41.402
CRISIS AND STATE.

01:40:41.468 --> 01:40:42.870
I'M SO THE ISSUE BEFORE THE

01:40:42.936 --> 01:40:44.238
LEGISLATURE IS REALLY WHETHER

01:40:44.304 --> 01:40:46.006
THE ASSEMBLIES ACTION TO PROVIDE

01:40:46.073 --> 01:40:47.107
MORE FUNDING FOR THIS PARTICULAR

01:40:47.174 --> 01:40:48.876
PROGRAM WOULD BE THE BEST WAY.

01:40:48.942 --> 01:40:49.810
TO RETRAIN PHYSICIANS ACROSS THE

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:51.178
STATE OR WHETHER THE ISSUE IS

01:40:51.245 --> 01:40:52.413
MORE FUNDAMENTAL IN THE WAY WE

01:40:52.479 --> 01:40:54.848
EDUCATE PHYSICIANS AND CONTINUED

01:40:54.915 --> 01:40:55.983
EDUCATED RETRAIN PHYSICIANS IN

01:40:56.049 --> 01:40:57.951
MOTHER MARK MORE TARGETED ACTION

01:40:58.018 --> 01:40:58.552
COULD BE DOWN THERE TO ADDRESS

01:40:58.619 --> 01:41:00.354
THAT ISSUE.

01:41:00.421 --> 01:41:01.722
ON THE SECOND PROPOSAL FOR.

01:41:01.789 --> 01:41:04.691
PROVIDING A RESEARCH FUNDING

01:41:04.758 --> 01:41:05.426
FOR RESEARCHING THE OF THE

01:41:05.492 --> 01:41:06.593
DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT OF CONSUMING

01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:07.828
SUGAR AND SOLID FOOD VERSES

01:41:07.895 --> 01:41:09.496
LIQUID.

01:41:09.563 --> 01:41:10.898
HERE WE WOULD JUST NOTE THIS IS

01:41:10.964 --> 01:41:12.366
A QUESTION OF SORT OF

01:41:12.433 --> 01:41:13.467
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY UP TO THE

01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:15.102
EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:41:15.169 --> 01:41:16.003
WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE FUNDING

01:41:16.069 --> 01:41:17.037
FOR THIS WE RECOMMEND DELETING

01:41:17.104 --> 01:41:18.539
TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF THIS FUND

01:41:18.605 --> 01:41:19.973
THAT WOULD BE USED FOR.

01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:21.608
ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD. THE

01:41:21.675 --> 01:41:23.377
LEGISLATURE ALREADY PROVIDES A

01:41:23.444 --> 01:41:25.512
FUNDING FOR AND SUPPORT FOR YOU

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:26.380
SEE LOTS OF.

01:41:26.447 --> 01:41:28.215
ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD THROUGH

01:41:28.282 --> 01:41:29.516
THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATIONS

01:41:29.583 --> 01:41:31.084
WE DO THINK THAT ADDITIONAL TWO

01:41:31.151 --> 01:41:31.585
MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE

01:41:31.652 --> 01:41:33.687
UNNECESSARY.

01:41:33.754 --> 01:41:34.488
AND THEN FINALLY FOR THE TWO

01:41:34.555 --> 01:41:35.055
MILLION DOLLARS FOR FIREARM

01:41:35.122 --> 01:41:36.089
VIOLENCE RESEARCH WE RECOMMEND

01:41:36.156 --> 01:41:38.058
GOING WITH THE SENATE HERE. OF

01:41:38.125 --> 01:41:39.560
WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE THE

01:41:39.626 --> 01:41:40.894
SENATE WAS APPROPRIATED FIVE

01:41:40.961 --> 01:41:41.929
MILLION DOLLARS AND SIXTEEN

01:41:41.995 --> 01:41:43.197
SEVENTEEN AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT

01:41:43.263 --> 01:41:44.765
MOST OF THE FUNDING IS IS STILL

01:41:44.832 --> 01:41:46.300
ON SPENT AND SO WE'D WE

01:41:46.366 --> 01:41:47.935
RECOMMEND. I HAVING A CENTER

01:41:48.001 --> 01:41:49.002
SPEND DOWN MORE THAT FUNDING

01:41:49.069 --> 01:41:50.404
REPORT BEFORE PROVIDING.

01:41:50.471 --> 01:41:51.538

VOTE ON THIS TICKET SPLIT OFF

01:42:16.497 --> 01:42:18.098
THE OPIOID RESEARCH FROM THE

01:42:18.165 --> 01:42:18.632
OTHER ITEMS THAT WOULD BE.

01:42:18.699 --> 01:42:18.765
.

01:42:18.832 --> 01:42:24.538
A PROBABLE.

01:42:27.341 --> 01:42:30.244
.

01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:31.979
WHEN I LOOKED AT THIS ITEM AND

01:42:32.045 --> 01:42:35.015
OBVIOUSLY SENATE DIDN'T HEAR IT.

01:42:35.082 --> 01:42:36.049
INDIVIDUALLY THAT.

01:42:36.116 --> 01:42:38.452
.

01:42:38.519 --> 01:42:39.052
PLACES THAT THE ASSEMBLY IS

01:42:39.119 --> 01:42:42.289
PROPOSING RESEARCH.

01:42:42.356 --> 01:42:42.856
KIDNAP IT WOULD SEEM TO HAVE

01:42:42.923 --> 01:42:44.024
GREAT MERIT.

01:42:44.091 --> 01:42:48.862
WHAT MY ISSUE IS IS THE TERM?

01:42:48.929 --> 01:42:50.731
SUBSTITUTING.

01:42:50.797 --> 01:42:52.533
IT A FACT FINDING THAT NEW

01:42:52.599 --> 01:42:55.002
RESEARCH THROUGH THE ELIMINATION

01:42:55.068 --> 01:42:57.671
OF CERTAIN PROGRAMS.

01:42:57.738 --> 01:42:59.406
SOME OF WHICH WERE ESTABLISHED

01:42:59.473 --> 01:43:01.275
LEGISLATIVELY.

01:43:01.341 --> 01:43:01.808
AND.

01:43:01.875 --> 01:43:03.710
FOR EXAMPLE THE CALIFORNIA

01:43:03.777 --> 01:43:05.045
PROGRAM ANALYSIS TO CARE THE

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:06.880
HEALTH INITIATIVES OF AMERICA

01:43:06.947 --> 01:43:08.882
VERY SUTTER THINGS I KNOW THE

01:43:08.949 --> 01:43:10.150
YOU SEE MEXICO INITIATIVE WAS

01:43:10.217 --> 01:43:11.051
RELEASED DONE THROUGH THE BUDGET

01:43:11.118 --> 01:43:13.487
IN TWENTY FOURTEEN FOR EXAMPLE.

01:43:13.554 --> 01:43:13.654
AND.

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.656
.

01:43:15.722 --> 01:43:17.391
IT SEEMS LIKE ONE OF THE

01:43:17.457 --> 01:43:21.929
SITUATIONS WHERE.

01:43:21.995 --> 01:43:22.829
WELL AT LEAST FOR MYSELF I WOULD

01:43:22.896 --> 01:43:23.397
NOT WANT TO BE PUT IN THE

01:43:23.463 --> 01:43:26.767
POSITION OF HAVING TO SAY.

01:43:26.833 --> 01:43:28.001
NO TO THIS EXISTING RESEARCH AND

01:43:28.068 --> 01:43:28.936
PROGRAMS.

01:43:29.002 --> 01:43:31.939
IN ORDER TO SAY YES TO.

01:43:32.005 --> 01:43:33.473
A PROPOSED. RESEARCH

01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:34.775
SO THAT WOULD BE A DIFFICULTY

01:43:34.841 --> 01:43:41.915
FOR ME.

01:43:41.982 --> 01:43:43.684
OKAY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:48.689
WHO CONDUCTS?

01:43:48.755 --> 01:43:50.324
ISSUE TWENTY FOUR TEACHING ABOUT

01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:52.125
LABOR PILOT PROGRAM.

01:43:52.192 --> 01:43:58.865
HOWEVER.

01:43:58.932 --> 01:44:00.601
BRIAN ANDERSON LEGISLATIVE

01:44:00.667 --> 01:44:02.369
ANALYST'S OFFICE THE ASSEMBLY.

LABOR HISTORY EDUCATION PILOT

01:44:11.011 --> 01:44:12.346
PROGRAM AND THESE FUNDS SHOULD

01:44:12.412 --> 01:44:14.781
BE ALLOCATED TO SIX COUNTIES

01:44:14.848 --> 01:44:16.183
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OVER A

01:44:16.249 --> 01:44:17.451
PERIOD OF THREE YEARS OUR

01:44:17.517 --> 01:44:19.219
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. THE BOOK

01:44:19.286 --> 01:44:20.787
OF THE FUNDING WOULD BE USED TO

01:44:20.854 --> 01:44:23.090

01:45:20.914 --> 01:45:21.848
WHAT WE TRIED TO CREATE HERE IS

01:45:21.915 --> 01:45:23.750
AN ONGOING PROGRAM THAT WILL BE

01:45:23.817 --> 01:45:25.786
EXPANDED TO ALL SCHOOLS?

01:45:25.852 --> 01:45:29.256

01:45:53.714 --> 01:45:55.182
THIS ISSUE CONCERNS BRIDGE

01:45:55.248 --> 01:45:56.516
FUNDING FOR VENDORS THAT PROVIDE

01:45:56.583 --> 01:45:58.719
SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS WITH

01:45:58.785 --> 01:46:00.554
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES THE

01:46:04.291 --> 01:46:06.526
TO BE SPENT OVER TWO YEARS.

01:46:06.593 --> 01:46:07.928
TO PROVIDE A TEMPORARY RATE

01:46:07.994 --> 01:46:09.763
INCREASE FOR VENDORS IN HIGH

01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:11.932
COST AREAS OF THE STATE. NAMELY

01:46:11.998 --> 01:46:13.867
THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE A LOCAL

LOCALLY MANDATED MINIMUM WAGE

01:46:15.736 --> 01:46:16.269
THAT EXCEEDS THE STATE MINIMUM

WAGE.

01:46:17.571 --> 01:46:19.106
THE STATE WOULD DRIVE DOWN ABOUT

01:46:19.172 --> 01:46:21.208
THIRTY EIGHT MILLION IN FEDERAL

01:46:21.274 --> 01:46:23.176

01:46:24.578 --> 01:46:26.313
THIS ONE TIME APPROPRIATION IS

01:46:26.379 --> 01:46:27.981
MEANT TO BRIDGE.

01:46:28.048 --> 01:46:30.383
THE PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN NOW

01:46:30.450 --> 01:46:31.585
AND WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:46:31.651 --> 01:46:33.487
DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES CAN

01:46:33.553 --> 01:46:35.188
COMPLETE ITS ONGOING. RATE STUDY

01:46:35.255 --> 01:46:36.323
AND IMPLEMENT ANY

RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT RATE

01:46:37.290 --> 01:46:38.992
STUDY.

01:46:39.059 --> 01:46:40.494
WE WOULD JUST RAISE A COUPLE

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:41.762
ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE

01:46:41.828 --> 01:46:43.630
CONSIDERATION.

01:46:43.697 --> 01:46:44.865
WE WOULD NOTE THAT RIGHT NOW THE

01:46:44.931 --> 01:46:46.399
STATE IS IN A REALLY INCREDIBLY

01:46:46.466 --> 01:46:47.300
DIFFICULT.

01:46:47.367 --> 01:46:49.102
POSITION.

01:46:49.169 --> 01:46:50.637
ON THE ONE HAND IT DOES NOT WANT

01:46:50.704 --> 01:46:52.139
TO BE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE

01:46:52.205 --> 01:46:53.707
FOR THE.

01:46:53.774 --> 01:46:55.709
POLICY DECISIONS MADE AT THE

01:46:55.776 --> 01:46:58.145
LOCAL LEVEL BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

01:46:58.211 --> 01:46:59.579
ON THE OTHER HAND THE STATE HAS

01:46:59.646 --> 01:47:01.448
ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY UNDER

01:47:01.515 --> 01:47:02.382
THE WENCH MEN OUT TO PROVIDE

01:47:02.449 --> 01:47:04.050
SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR

01:47:04.117 --> 01:47:05.118
INDIVIDUALS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL

01:47:05.185 --> 01:47:06.820
DISABILITIES.

01:47:06.887 --> 01:47:08.922
AND IF THOSE SERVICES AND

01:47:08.989 --> 01:47:11.825
SUPPORTS ARE NO LONGER ADEQUATE

01:47:11.892 --> 01:47:16.096
BECAUSE VENDORS CAN NOT BY THE

01:47:16.163 --> 01:47:16.730
VENDOR RATES CANNOT KEEP PACE

01:47:16.797 --> 01:47:17.864
WITH RISING COSTS THE STATE WILL

01:47:17.931 --> 01:47:18.365
STRUGGLE TO FULFILL ITS

01:47:18.431 --> 01:47:20.100
OBLIGATION UNDER THE LANTERN ACT.

01:47:20.167 --> 01:47:21.234
THIS PROPOSAL UNDER

01:47:21.301 --> 01:47:22.903
CONSIDERATION DOES HAVE SOME

01:47:22.969 --> 01:47:24.704
DRAWBACKS NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH

01:47:24.771 --> 01:47:26.339
IT'S A SHORT TERM SOLUTION TO A

01:47:26.406 --> 01:47:28.775
LONG TERM. PROBLEM.

01:47:28.842 --> 01:47:30.644
THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH

01:47:30.710 --> 01:47:32.479
TO WEIGH THOSE DRAWBACKS AGAINST

01:47:32.546 --> 01:47:33.947
ITS BENEFITS PRIMARILY THAT IT

01:47:34.014 --> 01:47:35.382
WOULD.

01:47:35.448 --> 01:47:36.850
POTENTIALLY STAVE OFF.

01:47:36.917 --> 01:47:39.019
PRO PROGRAM CLOSURES UNTIL A

01:47:39.085 --> 01:47:40.487
MORE LONG TERM SOLUTION CAN BE

01:47:40.554 --> 01:47:40.987
IDENTIFIED.

01:47:41.054 --> 01:47:45.091
THANK YOU.

01:47:45.158 --> 01:47:46.493
TIMES AFTER CLEAR FINE POINTLESS

01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:47.527
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T MIND BEFORE

01:47:47.594 --> 01:47:48.895
WE MOVE ON TO YOUR TESTIMONY SO

01:47:48.962 --> 01:47:50.463
YOU SAID IT'S IT'S IT'S A LONG

01:47:50.530 --> 01:47:52.699
TERM PROBLEM SO. IT IS MY

01:47:52.766 --> 01:47:54.034
UNDERSTANDING READ THE PROPOSAL

01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:56.603
THAT REALLY IS A BRIDGE UNTIL

01:47:56.670 --> 01:47:59.673
THE SURVEY IS COMPLETED AND AND

01:47:59.739 --> 01:48:02.776
MY ASSUMPTION IS. AND THEREFORE

01:48:02.843 --> 01:48:03.844
THE DEPARTMENT WITHIN TAKE

01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:05.846
ACTION ON THEIR SURVEY RESULTS

01:48:05.912 --> 01:48:08.215
AND. PERHAPS INCREASE

01:48:08.281 --> 01:48:09.749
OUR REIMBURSEMENT SO WHY DO YOU

01:48:09.816 --> 01:48:12.652
NOT SEE THIS AS TRULY SHORT TERM.

01:48:12.719 --> 01:48:14.254
SOLUTION TO A PROBLEM THERE

01:48:14.321 --> 01:48:19.226
PROPOSING I ASSUME TO FIX.

01:48:19.292 --> 01:48:20.393
WELL I THE IE CERTAINLY DIDN'T

01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:21.461
MEAN FOR THAT TO COME OFF AS

01:48:21.528 --> 01:48:22.028
CYNICAL.

01:48:22.095 --> 01:48:23.830
THE IT'S YOU KNOW EVERY IT'S

01:48:23.897 --> 01:48:24.965
EVERYBODY'S HOPE THAT THE RATE

01:48:25.031 --> 01:48:27.500
STUDY WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY

01:48:27.567 --> 01:48:30.637
INFORMATION TO RESTRUCTURE THE

01:48:30.704 --> 01:48:32.572
RATE STRUCTURE THAT THE RATE

01:48:32.639 --> 01:48:33.406
SYSTEM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:48:33.473 --> 01:48:34.474
DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES AND

01:48:34.541 --> 01:48:36.209
PROVIDE SOME. ACTIONABLE

01:48:36.276 --> 01:48:37.711
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE

01:48:37.777 --> 01:48:39.112
LEGISLATURE CAN TAKE.

01:48:39.179 --> 01:48:40.881
AT THE SAME TIME IT'S NOT THE

01:48:40.947 --> 01:48:42.249
FIRST TIME I READ STUDY HAS BEEN

01:48:42.315 --> 01:48:44.050
DONE IN THIS DEPARTMENT. AND IT

01:48:44.117 --> 01:48:45.919
DOESN'T MEAN THAT COSTS ARE NOT

01:48:45.986 --> 01:48:47.420
GOING THAT COSTS ARE HOLDING

01:48:47.487 --> 01:48:49.456
STEADY OR GOING DOWN COSTS

01:48:49.522 --> 01:48:50.557
CONTINUE TO RISE.

01:48:50.624 --> 01:48:52.692
IN SOME OF THESE AREAS

01:48:52.759 --> 01:48:54.027
PARTICULARLY THE AREAS WHERE.

01:48:54.094 --> 01:48:55.362
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN

01:48:55.428 --> 01:48:58.531
INCREASING THEIR MINIMUM WAGE SO.

01:48:58.598 --> 01:49:00.166
HOPEFULLY THE RATE STUDY YOU

01:49:00.233 --> 01:49:01.902
KNOW WILL PROVIDE SOME SOLUTIONS

01:49:01.968 --> 01:49:02.435
BUT.

01:49:02.502 --> 01:49:05.505
I THINK THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT

01:49:05.572 --> 01:49:07.474
THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE TO

01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:09.409
CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT. EVEN IF

01:49:09.476 --> 01:49:10.477
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE RATE

01:49:10.543 --> 01:49:13.213
STUDY ARE IMPLEMENTED. AND THAT

01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:14.748
AS AS I CAN RECALL THERE BEEN

01:49:14.814 --> 01:49:15.515
TIMES WHEN RATE STUDIES HAVE

01:49:15.582 --> 01:49:19.085
BEEN COMPLETED AND NO ACTION

01:49:19.152 --> 01:49:20.787
TAKEN SO THAT WE CAN ALL KIND OF

01:49:20.854 --> 01:49:22.088
IN THE ACTUALLY.

01:49:22.155 --> 01:49:22.722
THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION

01:49:22.789 --> 01:49:23.723
IS COST. THANK YOU WE SUPPORT

01:49:23.790 --> 01:49:25.125
THE SENATE VERSION AGAIN THIS IS

01:49:25.191 --> 01:49:26.726
A GENERAL FUND AUGMENTATION BUT

01:49:26.793 --> 01:49:28.328
I WOULD ACT OF SOME OF THE

01:49:28.395 --> 01:49:29.329
COMMENTS REYES BY THE ANALYSTS

01:49:29.396 --> 01:49:31.498
ON THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. ONE

01:49:31.564 --> 01:49:32.766
I THINK WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT BY

01:49:32.832 --> 01:49:34.868
UTILIZING THE LOCALLY ENACTED

01:49:34.935 --> 01:49:36.236
MINIMUM WAGE WE ARE SETTING A

01:49:36.303 --> 01:49:38.371
PRECEDENT ON THAT COULD INCREASE

01:49:38.438 --> 01:49:40.140
GENERAL FUND COST. ON WHAT'S

01:49:40.206 --> 01:49:41.574
REALLY A LOCAL DECISION

01:49:41.641 --> 01:49:44.210
SECONDARILY WE TOO WOULD LIKE TO

01:49:44.277 --> 01:49:45.512
SEE THE IRATE STUDY BE COMPLETE

01:49:45.578 --> 01:49:46.846
WHICH IS DUE TO THE LEGISLATURE

01:49:46.913 --> 01:49:48.248
BY MARCH FIRST OF TWENTY

01:49:48.315 --> 01:49:49.849
NINETEEN TO INFORM THESE ODD

TO THE LANTERN ACT AND THEREFORE

01:49:58.925 --> 01:50:01.027
THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY

01:50:01.094 --> 01:50:02.595
VERTICALLY TO THIS SERVICE

01:50:02.662 --> 01:50:04.364
POPULATION THAT WOULD. NOT

01:50:04.431 --> 01:50:05.765

MUNICIPALITIES THAT INCREASE.

01:50:12.205 --> 01:50:15.775
THEIR MINIMUM WAGE.

01:50:15.842 --> 01:50:16.977
I THINK I HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN

01:50:17.043 --> 01:50:18.178
OTHER PROGRAM AREAS WHERE WE CAN

01:50:18.244 --> 01:50:21.014
GET GET CONCERNED ABOUT A LOCAL

MINIMUM WAGE. ON AND SO THAT

01:50:25.151 --> 01:50:26.886

ITEM ON THIS ONE IT'S A VERY

01:50:40.367 --> 01:50:42.102
SIGNIFICANT. POTENTIAL I THINK

01:51:16.536 --> 01:51:17.904
SIDE.

01:51:17.971 --> 01:51:19.873
I DID WANT TO MENTION A FEW

01:51:19.939 --> 01:51:21.641
EXAMPLES WHERE I DO BELIEVE WE

01:51:21.708 --> 01:51:23.777
HAVE ADJUSTED OUR POLICIES AT

01:51:23.843 --> 01:51:25.678
THE STATEWIDE LEVEL. TO MATCH

01:51:25.745 --> 01:51:27.313
LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE IN ONE OF

01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:29.015
THOSE BEING AYE CHESS ES.

01:51:29.082 --> 01:51:30.750
AM I WANTED TO ASK DEPARTMENT OF

BRIDGE THIS DIVIDE.

01:51:35.355 --> 01:51:36.823
I DO FEEL THAT THE LONG TERM

01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:39.259
SOLUTION IS GOING TO BE THIS.

01:51:39.325 --> 01:51:40.693
RATE STUDY THAT WE ARE IN THE

01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:42.962
PROCESS OF WORKING THROUGH BUT

01:51:43.029 --> 01:51:44.564
IS THERE ANOTHER MECHANISM FOR

01:51:44.631 --> 01:51:46.366
US TO.

01:51:46.433 --> 01:51:48.201
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE BRIDGE

01:51:48.268 --> 01:51:50.136

01:51:50.203 --> 01:51:51.538
BE A MORE SYSTEMATIC APPROACH

01:51:51.604 --> 01:51:53.139
WHERE YOU HAD A.

01:51:53.206 --> 01:51:54.507
SIMILAR APPROACH FOR ALL

01:51:54.574 --> 01:51:56.209
COUNTIES RATHER THAN TARGETING

01:51:56.276 --> 01:51:57.444
IT TOWARD THOSE COUNTIES THAT

01:51:57.510 --> 01:51:59.012
WERE HIGH PRICE AND WHAT DOES

01:51:59.079 --> 01:52:00.580

01:52:00.647 --> 01:52:02.282
PRICE FOR THIS.

01:52:02.348 --> 01:52:03.183

01:52:03.249 --> 01:52:06.052
I HAVE.

01:52:06.119 --> 01:52:06.619
IS ACTUALLY THE CLOSURE OF

01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:11.264
UNIQUE TO THE FOSTER CARE

IT WOULD SEEM THAT.

01:56:28.881 --> 01:56:31.384
IN SOME CASES THE YOUNG PEOPLE

01:56:31.451 --> 01:56:32.485
THAT WERE IN GROUP HOMES WERE

01:56:32.552 --> 01:56:34.487
CONSIDERED.

01:56:34.554 --> 01:56:37.056
MOST DIFFICULT TO PLACE WITHIN

THE CONTINUUM OF CARE BECAUSE IN

01:57:20.533 --> 01:57:22.402
IN MOVING AWAY FROM GROUP HOMES

01:57:22.468 --> 01:57:24.070
WE ARE PUTTING SOME OF THE MOST

01:57:24.137 --> 01:57:25.738
DIFFICULT.

01:57:25.805 --> 01:57:27.907
A PLACE KIDS INTO.

01:57:27.974 --> 01:57:29.442

FURTHER EXPLANATION MAY BE A

02:06:58.410 --> 02:07:00.412
BASIS FOR YOUR COST ESTIMATE OF

ADAM DORSEY FIND IT SO.

02:07:05.117 --> 02:07:06.719
THE WAY THAT THIS

02:07:06.785 --> 02:07:08.253
PROPOSAL IS STRAPPED IT IS

02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:09.555
PROBLEMATIC FROM FOR A NUMBER OF

02:07:09.621 --> 02:07:11.490
REASONS AND.

02:07:11.557 --> 02:07:13.859
THE WAVE IT CLINIC BUNDLED RATES

02:07:13.926 --> 02:07:16.028
WORK TODAY IS THAT. ALL OF THE

02:07:16.095 --> 02:07:17.262
COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

02:07:17.329 --> 02:07:19.131
AVERAGE PERSON THAT WALKS INTO

02:07:19.198 --> 02:07:19.798
THE CLINIC.

02:07:19.865 --> 02:07:21.667
ARE CAPTURED INTO A RATE FOR

02:07:21.734 --> 02:07:24.003
THAT IS SPECIFIC TO THAT CLINIC.

02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:25.204
SEE YOU TAKE ALL OF THE SERVICES

02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:26.338
THAT ARE DELIVERED BY THE CLINIC

02:07:26.405 --> 02:07:27.740
OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR ANY

02:07:27.806 --> 02:07:29.141
DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF VISITS

02:07:29.208 --> 02:07:30.776
AND THAT'S THE RATE.

02:07:30.843 --> 02:07:32.478
AND THE WAY THAT THIS LANGUAGE

02:07:32.544 --> 02:07:34.246
IS DRAFTED IS THAT.

02:07:34.313 --> 02:07:36.615
YOU'RE YOU'RE ABLE TO BILL TWICE

02:07:36.682 --> 02:07:39.284
FOR THE SAME PATIENT.

02:07:39.351 --> 02:07:40.652
WHEN THOSE COSTS ARE ALREADY

02:07:40.719 --> 02:07:43.522
INCLUDED IN THAT BUNDLE GREAT

02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:45.424
WITHOUT HAVING TO GO BACK IN.

02:07:45.491 --> 02:07:47.359

02:07:47.426 --> 02:07:48.660
PAUL THE SERVICE TO YOUR BILLING

02:07:48.727 --> 02:07:50.963
FOR SEPARATELY OUT.

02:07:51.030 --> 02:07:51.630
SO IN THE PAST WHEN WE'VE PULLED

02:07:51.697 --> 02:07:53.799
OUT. UM SERVICES FROM THE RATE

02:07:53.866 --> 02:07:54.900
LIKE DENTAL CAN BE BILLED

02:07:54.967 --> 02:07:56.001
SEPARATELY.

02:07:56.068 --> 02:07:58.270
MFPS WE ARE IN THE PROCESS A

02:07:58.337 --> 02:08:00.072
MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPISTS

02:08:00.139 --> 02:08:01.807
OF PULLING THAT UP FOR THE RATE.

02:08:01.874 --> 02:08:03.509
THE CLINIC GOES AND THEY REDO

02:08:03.575 --> 02:08:04.777
THEIR RATES THAT THOSE COSTS

02:08:04.843 --> 02:08:06.578
AREN'T DOUBLE COUNTED.

02:08:06.645 --> 02:08:07.146
AND THIS PROPOSAL DOESN'T DO

02:08:07.212 --> 02:08:08.380
THAT.

02:08:08.447 --> 02:08:09.848
AND SO IT ALLOWS CLINICS TO GO

02:08:09.915 --> 02:08:12.051
IN AND BILL THAT BUNDLED RATE

02:08:12.117 --> 02:08:13.919
MULTIPLE TIMES AND AND THAT IS

02:08:13.986 --> 02:08:15.888
WHAT MAKES THIS PROPOSAL SO

02:08:15.954 --> 02:08:17.289
EXPENSIVE AND ALSO WE HAVE

02:08:17.356 --> 02:08:18.190
POLICY CONCERNS WITH THAT

02:08:18.257 --> 02:08:20.192
APPROACH.

02:08:20.259 --> 02:08:21.894
DO WE KNOW TODAY WHETHER. UNDER

02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:24.229
THE CURRENT SITUATION WHETHER.

02:08:24.296 --> 02:08:26.799
PATIENTS ARE GOING IN FOR THEIR.

02:08:26.865 --> 02:08:28.300
PHYSICAL PROBLEM AND ON THE SAME

02:08:28.367 --> 02:08:31.370
DAY SEEING SOMEONE FOR A.

02:08:31.437 --> 02:08:33.639
SAVE YOUR WHOLE SERVICES.

02:08:33.705 --> 02:08:36.442
YES ABSOLUTELY THAT THAT CAN AND

02:08:36.508 --> 02:08:37.743
DOES HAPPEN DO WE KNOW TO WHAT

02:08:37.810 --> 02:08:40.345
EXTENT.

02:08:40.412 --> 02:08:42.181
THE WORDS ARE CLINICS. NOT

02:08:42.247 --> 02:08:43.715
SCHEDULING PEOPLE ON THE SAME

02:08:43.782 --> 02:08:46.785
DAY BECAUSE OF THIS THIS ISSUE.

02:08:46.852 --> 02:08:49.455
FOR EXAMPLE MAN DIDN'T IN FACT

02:08:49.521 --> 02:08:50.989
SCHEDULING THEM IN A SUBSEQUENT

02:08:51.056 --> 02:08:52.157
DAY AND THEN THE PATIENT DOESN'T

02:08:52.224 --> 02:08:53.659
RETURN.

02:08:53.725 --> 02:08:56.595
OR ARE. THEY NOT WITHSTANDING

02:08:56.662 --> 02:08:58.497
THE FACT THAT THE BUNDLED RATE.

02:08:58.564 --> 02:09:00.966
APPARENTLY AT LEAST.

02:09:01.033 --> 02:09:02.101
TO THEIR PIC STATUS NOT

02:09:02.167 --> 02:09:04.336
SUFFICIENT. NOT SCHEDULING THEM

02:09:04.403 --> 02:09:06.004
FOR THE SAME DAY SERVICE AND IN

02:09:06.071 --> 02:09:07.973
FACT IT MAKES SENSE YEAH SO.

02:09:08.040 --> 02:09:09.074
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE

02:09:09.141 --> 02:09:10.476
WE'VE HEARD A LOT FROM THE

02:09:10.542 --> 02:09:11.910
CLINICS OVER THE YEARS AND AND

02:09:11.977 --> 02:09:13.846
WE'VE WORKED REALLY HARD TO TRY

02:09:13.912 --> 02:09:14.480
TO.

02:09:14.546 --> 02:09:16.748
WORK WITH THEM I'M TO COME UP

02:09:16.815 --> 02:09:18.450
WITH AN ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

02:09:18.517 --> 02:09:19.585
METHODOLOGY AND.

02:09:19.651 --> 02:09:22.421
THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN YOU

02:09:22.488 --> 02:09:23.755
KNOW ONGOING OFTEN ON.

02:09:25.357 --> 02:09:25.891
YOU KNOW FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

02:09:25.958 --> 02:09:27.092
NOW.

02:09:27.159 --> 02:09:29.394
AND IT WAS TO GET OUT THAT

02:09:29.461 --> 02:09:32.131
INCENTIVE PROGRAM AND AND AND

02:09:32.197 --> 02:09:33.465
MAKING SURE THAT THERE WAS AN

02:09:33.532 --> 02:09:35.200
INCENTIVE TO SEND SOMEONE AWAY

02:09:35.267 --> 02:09:36.635
WHEN THEY COULD BE SEEN ON THE

02:09:36.702 --> 02:09:37.803
SAME DAY.

02:09:37.870 --> 02:09:40.305
SO WHILE WE ARE.

02:09:40.372 --> 02:09:42.141
WE STRONGLY PETE THAT THAT THAT

02:09:42.207 --> 02:09:43.208
THE RAPE THAT REIMBURSEMENT

02:09:43.275 --> 02:09:44.176
METHODOLOGY THAT THEY'RE

02:09:44.243 --> 02:09:46.678
ENTITLED TO UNDER FEDERAL LAW

02:09:46.745 --> 02:09:48.213
ACCOUNTS FOR ALL OF THEIR COSTS.

02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:50.382
WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE MAY BE.

02:09:50.449 --> 02:09:52.050
AND AN INCENTIVE THAT ISN'T

02:09:52.117 --> 02:09:53.252
QUITE RIGHT FOR THE CLINIC TO

02:09:53.318 --> 02:09:54.620
SEND THEM AWAY SO THAT THEY CAN

02:09:54.686 --> 02:09:56.855
BILL FOR THAT BUNDLED RATE AGAIN

02:09:56.922 --> 02:09:57.856
IF THEY COME BACK ON A DIFFERENT

02:09:57.923 --> 02:10:00.092
DAY. SO THAT'S WHAT THAT WORK

02:10:00.159 --> 02:10:01.860
GROUP WAS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS IS

02:10:01.927 --> 02:10:02.828
THAT INCENTIVE PROBLEM THAT

02:10:02.895 --> 02:10:05.164
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:10:05.230 --> 02:10:06.298
I DON'T WANT TO TALK AGAINST THE

02:10:06.365 --> 02:10:07.733
SENATE PROPOSAL HAVE YOU THOUGHT

02:10:07.799 --> 02:10:09.701
ABOUT A PILOT PROGRAM TO REALLY

02:10:09.768 --> 02:10:11.770
TRY TO DRILL DOWN.

02:10:11.837 --> 02:10:13.939
ON A RELATIVELY SMALL SCALE TO

02:10:14.006 --> 02:10:15.707
DETERMINE WHAT THE ACTUAL COST

02:10:15.774 --> 02:10:18.544
IS BY. CHANGING THE.

02:10:18.610 --> 02:10:20.412
PAYMENT METHODOLOGY.

02:10:20.479 --> 02:10:21.613
YEAH THE AND THAT THAT IS WHAT

02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:22.781
THE GROUP WAS DESIGNED TO

02:10:22.848 --> 02:10:24.850
ADDRESS THAT THE ISSUE IS THAT

02:10:24.917 --> 02:10:25.584
WE WOULD HAVE TO COME TO AN

02:10:25.651 --> 02:10:27.586
AGREEMENT OVER WHAT THAT LOOKS

02:10:27.653 --> 02:10:29.154
LIKE WITH THE CLINICS BECAUSE.

02:10:29.221 --> 02:10:30.889
THIS I'M THIS TYPE OF BUNDLED

02:10:30.956 --> 02:10:32.925
RATE IS A FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT

02:10:32.991 --> 02:10:34.660
IT'S ITSELF THAT SADDAM YOU KNOW

02:10:34.726 --> 02:10:35.928
THERE'S FEDERAL LAW LAWS THAT

02:10:35.994 --> 02:10:36.461
ENTITLED THE CLINICS THAT

02:10:36.528 --> 02:10:38.130

HOW THAT MAKES SENSE FOR FQHCS

02:10:49.841 --> 02:10:51.276
BUT AS YOU TALK ABOUT WE'VE

02:10:51.343 --> 02:10:52.644
ALREADY CARVED OUT.

02:10:52.711 --> 02:10:54.713
THERE'S A FAMILY THERAPIST AND

02:10:54.780 --> 02:10:56.481

02:11:19.805 --> 02:11:23.075
DEVELOPS IT AS OPPOSED TO.

02:11:23.141 --> 02:11:24.042
WHETHER OR NOT YOU BELIEVE THAT

02:11:24.109 --> 02:11:24.776
IS A VALID.

02:11:24.843 --> 02:11:26.545
.

02:11:26.612 --> 02:11:28.513
SERVICE TO CARVE OUT.

02:11:28.580 --> 02:11:30.582
THAT NOT THE WHAT BUT THE HOW WE

02:11:30.649 --> 02:11:32.517
DID IT LIKE YOU'VE DONE DENTAL

02:11:32.584 --> 02:11:34.219
IN MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST.

02:11:34.286 --> 02:11:34.786
I DON'T THINK THAT.

02:11:34.853 --> 02:11:36.888
.

02:11:36.955 --> 02:11:37.990
I DON'T THINK THAT ARE IT OUR

02:11:38.056 --> 02:11:39.291
OBJECTIONS HAVE FOCUSED BOTTOM

02:11:39.358 --> 02:11:40.892
AROUND.

02:11:40.959 --> 02:11:42.194
YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S.

02:11:42.261 --> 02:11:43.328
GOOD POLICY TE.

02:11:43.395 --> 02:11:45.297
.

02:11:45.364 --> 02:11:46.999
TAKE CAN TO CONTINUE THESE CARVE

02:11:47.065 --> 02:11:48.533
OUTS NECESSARILY I THINK THE WAY

02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:49.901
THAT THIS IS DONE THAT DOESN'T

02:11:49.968 --> 02:11:51.236
REQUIRE THEM TO GO BACK AND

02:11:51.303 --> 02:11:52.938
RELOOK AT THAT BUNDLED RATE TO

02:11:53.005 --> 02:11:53.438
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT

02:11:53.505 --> 02:11:54.539
ACCOUNTING FOR IT.

02:11:54.606 --> 02:11:56.642
I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ONE ISSUE

02:11:56.708 --> 02:11:58.510
I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE.

02:11:58.577 --> 02:12:00.545
MAYBE AN EASIER PILL TO SWALLOW

02:12:00.612 --> 02:12:02.047
IF IT WERE JUST THAT NEVER JUST

02:12:02.114 --> 02:12:03.248
COME IT WOULD JUST DOLLARS RIGHT.

02:12:03.315 --> 02:12:04.816
.

02:12:04.883 --> 02:12:05.651
I THINK THAT I THINK THAT.

02:12:05.717 --> 02:12:07.352
.

02:12:07.419 --> 02:12:08.987
THE WHAT WE HAVE INDICATED DE

02:12:09.054 --> 02:12:10.956
I'M RECENTLY ON THIS PROPOSAL IS

02:12:11.023 --> 02:12:11.723
THAT.

02:12:11.790 --> 02:12:13.859
IT WOULD BE A MONEY ISSUE IF

02:12:13.925 --> 02:12:15.160
EVERYONE WERE FORCED TO COME IN

02:12:15.227 --> 02:12:17.529
AND REDO THAT RATE AND THAT IS.

02:12:17.596 --> 02:12:19.197
ON A POLICY BASIS.

02:12:19.264 --> 02:12:21.400
MAYBE A MORE FAIR WAY TO GO

02:12:21.466 --> 02:12:23.769
ABOUT DOING IT I'M EVEN IF IT'S

02:12:23.835 --> 02:12:25.704
COSTLY OP IF IT'S STILL COSTLY

02:12:25.771 --> 02:12:29.207
AS IS THIS PROPOSAL IS.

02:12:29.274 --> 02:12:30.742
AND IT TURNS BE IT BEEN COSTLY I

02:12:30.809 --> 02:12:32.711
THINK IT GETS TO SENATOR ROTH'S

02:12:32.778 --> 02:12:32.944
PIECE.

02:12:33.011 --> 02:12:37.616
AND AND SO MY QUESTION I BASK

02:12:37.683 --> 02:12:40.519
IN THE PAST IN TERMS OF.

02:12:40.585 --> 02:12:41.687
YOU YOU KNOW I HOPE THAT WERE

02:12:41.753 --> 02:12:43.488
NOT.

02:12:43.555 --> 02:12:46.158
CONTROLLING COSTS BY DEVELOPING

02:12:46.224 --> 02:12:47.959
SYSTEMS THAT.

02:12:48.026 --> 02:12:49.461
ON MAKE IT COMPLICATED FOR

02:12:49.528 --> 02:12:51.296
PEOPLE TO TO RECEIVE THE

02:12:51.363 --> 02:12:53.031
SERVICES IN THE HELP THEY NEED.

02:12:53.098 --> 02:12:55.434
THAT BY REQUIRING THAT IT NOT BE

02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:57.169
ON THE SAME DAY THAT WE ARE

02:12:57.235 --> 02:12:58.904
COUNTING BASICALLY SCORING

02:12:58.970 --> 02:13:00.572
SAVINGS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT

02:13:00.639 --> 02:13:02.474
PEOPLE AS THIRD PERCENT PERCENT

02:13:02.541 --> 02:13:03.041
OF THE POPULATION WON'T COME

02:13:03.108 --> 02:13:03.241
BACK.

02:13:03.308 --> 02:13:05.577
BUT.

02:13:05.644 --> 02:13:07.746
HOW HOW YOU'VE COME?

02:13:07.813 --> 02:13:10.415
TO THIS FEE IS CURIOUS TO ME.

02:13:10.482 --> 02:13:13.218
IF INDEED THESE ARE SERVICES

02:13:13.285 --> 02:13:15.053
THAT FQHC PATIENTS ARE ENTITLED

02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:18.557
TO. AND WE'RE WE'RE.

02:13:18.623 --> 02:13:20.392
BY VIRTUE OF THEM NOT COMING ON

02:13:20.459 --> 02:13:22.728
SEPARATE DAYS WE'RE NOT PAN OUT

02:13:22.794 --> 02:13:24.429
THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY TODAY YOU

02:13:24.496 --> 02:13:26.498
FOLLOW ME. I I DO I I THINK THAT

02:13:26.565 --> 02:13:28.266
THIS IS ONE OF THE. POINTS THAT

02:13:28.333 --> 02:13:29.368
WOULD BE REALLY TAKE ISSUE IS

02:13:29.434 --> 02:13:31.336
THAT THERE IS NO PROHIBITION ON

02:13:31.403 --> 02:13:32.804
PEOPLE GETTING MULTIPLE SERVICES

02:13:32.871 --> 02:13:34.506
IN THE SAME DAY AND IN FACT THAT

02:13:34.573 --> 02:13:35.674
IS THE WAY THE RATES ARE BUILT

02:13:35.741 --> 02:13:37.943
THERE BUILT AROUND THE IDEA THAT.

02:13:38.009 --> 02:13:39.611
PATIENTS COME IN AND THEY ARE

02:13:39.678 --> 02:13:41.046
GETTING MULTIPLE SERVICES ON ONE

02:13:41.113 --> 02:13:43.248
DAY AND THAT'S WHY THAT THAT

02:13:43.315 --> 02:13:44.850
BUNDLED RATE IS.

02:13:44.916 --> 02:13:47.119
YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES MUCH MORE

02:13:47.185 --> 02:13:48.420
THAN GOING AND SEEING A PRIMARY

02:13:48.487 --> 02:13:49.888
CARE PHYSICIAN.

02:13:49.955 --> 02:13:50.722
AND SO.

02:13:50.789 --> 02:13:52.758
THERE ISN'T A PROHIBITION ON

02:13:52.824 --> 02:13:54.226
RECEIVING MULTIPLE SERVICE DAY

02:13:54.292 --> 02:13:56.628
ALTHOUGH WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.

02:13:56.695 --> 02:13:58.130
THIS KIND OF INCENTIVE ARGUMENT

02:13:58.196 --> 02:13:59.030
IS THAT.

02:13:59.097 --> 02:14:01.133
MAYBE I A CLINIC WOULD BE ABLE

02:14:01.199 --> 02:14:02.567
TO GET MORE IF THEY SEND SOMEONE

02:14:02.634 --> 02:14:03.468
BACK THEY CAME BACK THE

02:14:03.535 --> 02:14:04.503
FOLLOWING DAY THEY COULD BUILD

02:14:04.569 --> 02:14:06.104
THAT READ AGAIN AND THAT WAS THE

02:14:06.171 --> 02:14:07.706
IDEA BEHIND THIS WORK GROUP TO

02:14:07.773 --> 02:14:09.975
TRY TO GET AROUND AN ALTERNATIVE

02:14:10.041 --> 02:14:11.209
HIM AT ALL.

02:14:11.276 --> 02:14:13.612
THINKING THAT YEAR THANK YOU.

02:14:13.678 --> 02:14:15.881
THANK YOU SIMILAR PROBLEMS.

02:14:15.947 --> 02:14:17.048
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR A LOT NOW

02:14:17.115 --> 02:14:18.850
I'M REALLY CONFUSED AND KIND OF

02:14:18.917 --> 02:14:21.052
FLUMMOXED BY THIS BECAUSE THAT

02:14:21.119 --> 02:14:22.554
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE.

02:14:22.621 --> 02:14:24.189
ISSUE THAT'S PRESENTED TO US

02:14:24.256 --> 02:14:27.058
HERE ON IS A DIRECT RESULT OF

02:14:27.125 --> 02:14:28.260
THE CLINIC SAYING THAT THEY

02:14:28.326 --> 02:14:29.194
CAN'T.

02:14:29.261 --> 02:14:31.696
REFER IN THE SAME DAY A MINUTE

02:14:31.763 --> 02:14:33.432
THERE'S A TWENTY FOUR HOUR

02:14:33.498 --> 02:14:35.267
WAITING PERIOD AND AYE I IMAGINE

02:14:35.333 --> 02:14:37.402
WE'RE NOT GOING TO. RESOLVE THAT

02:14:37.469 --> 02:14:39.271
TO A DIFFERENCE BUT IT'S.

02:14:39.337 --> 02:14:41.139
BIZARRE TO ME THAT.

02:14:41.206 --> 02:14:43.442
THERE'S DISAGREEMENT ON WHAT

02:14:43.508 --> 02:14:44.810
WOULD APPEAR TO BE SUCH UP A

02:14:44.876 --> 02:14:45.744
FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE.

02:14:45.811 --> 02:14:48.413
AB.

02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:49.948
THE THE OTHER THING THAT IS A

02:14:50.015 --> 02:14:51.349
BIT TROUBLING TO ME IS THAT FOR

02:14:51.416 --> 02:14:53.785
AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS

02:14:53.852 --> 02:14:56.888
PATIENTS WHO ARE IN NEED OF FOR

02:14:56.955 --> 02:14:58.824
ACUTE CARE SERVICES. I'M IN THE

02:14:58.890 --> 02:15:00.292
MOMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO WAIT

02:15:00.358 --> 02:15:01.626
AND THAT THEREFORE.

02:15:02.327 --> 02:15:03.628
THE POTENTIAL IS A GREAT

02:15:03.695 --> 02:15:05.897
POTENTIAL IS THAT SOME WILL NOT

02:15:05.964 --> 02:15:07.532
SOME WILL RECEIVE CARE DOWN THE

02:15:07.599 --> 02:15:08.366
ROAD.

02:15:08.433 --> 02:15:10.335
WHICH DURING WHICH THERE.

02:15:10.402 --> 02:15:11.870
.

02:15:11.937 --> 02:15:15.273
OF SYMPTOMATOLOGY MAY GET WORSE.

02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:17.809
THERE'S A A HUGE.

02:15:17.876 --> 02:15:20.445
PREVENTION ISSUE HERE THAT TOOK

02:15:20.512 --> 02:15:22.714
A AT THAT SEEMS TO EXIST BUT

02:15:22.781 --> 02:15:23.315
WHAT I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND

02:15:23.381 --> 02:15:24.249
THIS MIGHT.

02:15:24.316 --> 02:15:25.717
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S

02:15:25.784 --> 02:15:27.686
THIRTY TWO OTHER STATES.

02:15:27.752 --> 02:15:30.355
THAT HAVE IN SOMEWHERE ANOTHER

02:15:30.422 --> 02:15:32.023
SOLVE THIS ISSUE AND ALLOW SAME

02:15:32.090 --> 02:15:34.693
DAY VISITS AND A.

02:15:34.759 --> 02:15:36.695
IT IS THERE.

02:15:36.761 --> 02:15:38.997
HAS THERE BEEN A REVIEW OF OF

02:15:39.064 --> 02:15:41.933
WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING AND.

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.636
I THINK.

02:15:44.703 --> 02:15:45.670
IT'S NOT A QUESTION YOU CAN

02:15:45.737 --> 02:15:47.239
ANSWER THE TIME THAT WE HAVE

02:15:47.305 --> 02:15:47.439
TODAY.

02:15:47.506 --> 02:15:49.007
.

02:15:49.074 --> 02:15:51.209
WHY IT IS THAT TO HOPE A ONE OF

02:15:51.276 --> 02:15:53.111
THOSE MODELS MAYBE JUST ONE OF

02:15:53.178 --> 02:15:54.713
THEM OUT WHAT WORKED RELATIVELY

02:15:54.779 --> 02:15:56.147
WELL IN CALIFORNIA YEAH JUST TO

02:15:56.214 --> 02:15:57.549
CLARIFY I MEAN THERE IS NO

02:15:57.616 --> 02:15:59.351
PROHIBITION ON SAME DAY VISITS

02:15:59.417 --> 02:16:01.019
THEIR RATE ASSUMES THAT THAT

02:16:01.086 --> 02:16:02.487
PEOPLE ARE ARE GETTING?

02:16:02.554 --> 02:16:04.055
MULTIPLE SERVICES WHEN THEY

02:16:04.122 --> 02:16:05.357
WHEN THEY COME INTO THE CLINIC.

02:16:05.423 --> 02:16:08.059
TODAY BUT WE HAVE MADE.

02:16:08.660 --> 02:16:10.829
EXCEPTIONS IN STATE LAWS.

02:16:10.896 --> 02:16:12.030
THROUGH YOU KNOW PREVIOUS

02:16:12.097 --> 02:16:13.398
LEGISLATION.

02:16:13.465 --> 02:16:15.967
TO BILL FOR SERVICES SEPARATELY.

02:16:16.034 --> 02:16:17.402
AS WE TALKED ABOUT SO LET ME

02:16:17.469 --> 02:16:19.271
MAKE SURE I'VE FORGIVE ME FOR

02:16:19.337 --> 02:16:20.605
INTERRUPTING THAT WERE. OUR

02:16:20.672 --> 02:16:22.474
NOMENCLATURE SAME BECAUSE YOU'VE

REPEATEDLY SAID.

02:16:23.708 --> 02:16:25.710
THERE'S NO PROHIBITION ON SAME

02:16:25.777 --> 02:16:27.078
DAY SERVICES AND WHAT I'M

02:16:27.145 --> 02:16:28.246
READING IS THAT THERE IS A

02:16:28.313 --> 02:16:30.048
REQUIREMENT OF A TWENTY FOUR

02:16:30.115 --> 02:16:32.651
HOUR GAP. IN SERVICES BETWEEN

02:16:32.717 --> 02:16:34.753
REFERRAL FROM PRIMARY CARE. AND

02:16:34.819 --> 02:16:36.321
THEN BEING SEEN BY MENTAL HEALTH

02:16:36.388 --> 02:16:39.057
PROVIDER DOES THAT EXIST.

02:16:39.124 --> 02:16:40.825
THE ISSUE IS THAT THEY.

02:16:40.892 --> 02:16:42.794
THE CLINIC CANNOT BE ABLE THIS

02:16:42.861 --> 02:16:45.063
BUNDLED RATE MULTIPLE TIMES ON

02:16:45.130 --> 02:16:46.464
THE SAME DAY THEY HAVE TO THEY

02:16:46.531 --> 02:16:47.666

S. MEMORABILIA.

02:17:11.056 --> 02:17:11.790
YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES WE.

02:17:11.856 --> 02:17:13.391
.

GET MIXED UP IN THE NOMENCLATURE

02:17:15.827 --> 02:17:17.829
OR THAT TERMINOLOGY AND AND YET

02:17:17.896 --> 02:17:19.831
THERE IS A REAL PROBLEM. THAT

02:17:19.898 --> 02:17:21.433
SEEMINGLY IS GOING ON ADDRESSED

02:17:21.499 --> 02:17:22.968
INSIDE LIKE TO.

02:17:23.034 --> 02:17:24.970
SEE IF WE CAN BE CREATIVE TO

02:17:25.036 --> 02:17:26.104
ADDRESS THIS SERVICE AND I'M

02:17:26.171 --> 02:17:28.106
GOING TO.

02:17:28.173 --> 02:17:30.609
BRING MY MORE RURAL. ASPECT OF

02:17:30.675 --> 02:17:31.810
THE STATE INTO THIS DISCUSSION

02:17:31.876 --> 02:17:33.078
THAT.

02:17:33.144 --> 02:17:34.813
IT'S MORE DIFFICULT FOR CERTAIN

02:17:34.879 --> 02:17:36.348
PARTS OF OUR STATE TO GET TO OUR

02:17:36.414 --> 02:17:38.116
FQHCS AND RURAL HEALTH CLINICS

02:17:38.183 --> 02:17:39.551
AND.

02:17:39.618 --> 02:17:40.619
GETTING BACK THE NEXT DAY IS

02:17:40.685 --> 02:17:42.253
DIFFICULT PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU

02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:44.322
HAVE MULTIPLE PROBLEMS.

02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:46.958
MIGHT ISSUE STEMS FROM WHETHER

02:17:47.025 --> 02:17:48.960
THE RAIDERS SUFFICIENT.

02:17:49.027 --> 02:17:51.229
TO MEET BOTH.

02:17:51.296 --> 02:17:52.764
SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED IN THE

02:17:52.831 --> 02:17:54.265
SAME DAY BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE

02:17:54.332 --> 02:17:55.467
HEARING FROM THE GROUND LEVEL

02:17:55.533 --> 02:17:58.303
FROM THE FQHCS IS THAT IT'S NOT.

02:17:58.370 --> 02:18:00.805
SO IS THERE A NEED TO LOOK AT

02:18:00.872 --> 02:18:03.041
THAT RATE THAT CAPITATED RATE TO

02:18:03.108 --> 02:18:04.976
AUGMENT IT. TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:18:05.043 --> 02:18:06.378
IT'S MEETING THE MENTAL HEALTH

02:18:06.444 --> 02:18:09.180
NEEDS OF OUR STATE OR HOW BEST

02:18:09.247 --> 02:18:11.883
CAN WE INSURE THAT WE ARE.

02:18:11.950 --> 02:18:13.551
YEAH ALLOWING PEOPLE TO RECEIVE

02:18:13.618 --> 02:18:15.253
MULTIPLE SERVICES ON THE SAME

02:18:15.320 --> 02:18:17.122
DAY AND FOR PROVIDERS AND

02:18:17.188 --> 02:18:18.423
CLINICS TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THE

02:18:18.490 --> 02:18:21.726
LIGHTS ON AND THE DOORS OPEN.

02:18:21.793 --> 02:18:22.794
SO THAT MEAN THAT'S A REALLY

02:18:22.861 --> 02:18:24.562
HARD QUESTION TO ANSWER BECAUSE

02:18:24.629 --> 02:18:25.997
EVERY CLINIC IS DIFFERENT.

02:18:26.064 --> 02:18:28.967
CLINICS WILL ASK FOR A CHANGE

02:18:29.034 --> 02:18:30.235
IN THEIR SCOPE AND A CHANGE IN

02:18:30.301 --> 02:18:30.502
THE RATE.

02:18:30.568 --> 02:18:32.904
WHEN I'M WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE

02:18:32.971 --> 02:18:33.905
THEY NEED THEY NEED IT.

02:18:33.972 --> 02:18:34.873
YOU KNOW WHEN THEY START

02:18:34.939 --> 02:18:36.374
OFFERING NEW SERVICES OR

02:18:36.441 --> 02:18:37.409
WHATEVER THEY CAN THEY CAN

02:18:37.475 --> 02:18:38.643
REQUEST IN THE RAIN.

02:18:38.710 --> 02:18:39.811
AND THE WAY THAT IT WORKS IS

02:18:39.878 --> 02:18:41.079
THAT WHEN YOU FIRST GET THAT

02:18:41.146 --> 02:18:42.881
RATES IT ACCOUNTS FOR ALL OF

02:18:42.947 --> 02:18:44.683
THOSE COSTS RIGHT SO ALL OF

02:18:44.749 --> 02:18:46.117
THOSE COSTS ARE CALIFORNIA RATE

02:18:46.184 --> 02:18:47.752
AND THEN IT GROWS EVERY YEAR BY

02:18:47.819 --> 02:18:49.554
THE MEDICARE ECONOMIC INDEX.

02:18:49.621 --> 02:18:51.256
SOME CLINICS COST MAY GROW

02:18:51.322 --> 02:18:54.325
FASTER SLOWER THAN ANY I BET.

02:18:54.392 --> 02:18:56.594
YOU KNOW THERE IS THERE IS THAT

02:18:56.661 --> 02:18:58.563
RIGHT THERE THAT IS A FEDERAL

02:18:58.630 --> 02:18:59.964
ENTITLEMENT FOR THESE CLINICS

02:19:00.031 --> 02:19:00.965
THAT ACCOUNTS FOR ALL OF THOSE

02:19:01.032 --> 02:19:03.101
COSTS IN GROWS EVERY YEAR.

02:19:03.168 --> 02:19:05.303
BET THAT YOU KNOW HOW MANY

02:19:05.370 --> 02:19:07.305
CLINIC FAIRS YOU KNOW I'M IS

02:19:07.372 --> 02:19:09.441
REALLY AN INDIVIDUAL SITUATION

02:19:09.507 --> 02:19:11.376
MAYBE THEN YOU CAN SPEAK TO THE

02:19:11.443 --> 02:19:12.844
ASSUMPTIONS THAT WERE MADE AND.

02:19:14.012 --> 02:19:16.014
YOUR COST ANALYSIS SO YOU HAD

02:19:16.081 --> 02:19:17.816
STATE THAT IT WOULD BE CLOSER

02:19:17.882 --> 02:19:19.584
TOWARDS A HUNDRED MILLION AND SO.

02:19:19.651 --> 02:19:21.052
WHICH ASSUMPTIONS DID YOU MAKE

02:19:21.119 --> 02:19:23.054
THAT WERE NOT MADE IN THE SENATE

02:19:23.121 --> 02:19:24.622
SIDE THAT LED YOU TO THAT

02:19:24.689 --> 02:19:25.356
CONCLUSION.

02:19:25.423 --> 02:19:27.292
AND AND.

02:19:27.358 --> 02:19:28.526
START THAT YEAH SO WE'RE

02:19:28.593 --> 02:19:30.195
FINALIZING AN ESTIMATE RIGHT NOW.

02:19:30.261 --> 02:19:32.330
.

02:19:32.397 --> 02:19:34.733
AND IT'S BASED ON A COUPLE

02:19:34.799 --> 02:19:36.568
DIFFERENT SCENARIOS SO I'M WE

02:19:36.634 --> 02:19:38.069
HAVE A RANGE AT THE MOMENT.

02:19:38.136 --> 02:19:40.505
THAT KIND OF TRIES TO TAKE INTO

02:19:40.572 --> 02:19:42.207
ACCOUNT SORT OF AN ASSUMPTION

02:19:42.273 --> 02:19:45.143
AROUND. HOW MANY CLINICS WILL BE

02:19:45.210 --> 02:19:46.044
DO WILL DO BETTER UNDER THE

02:19:46.111 --> 02:19:47.545
CURRENT SORT OF GREAT

02:19:47.612 --> 02:19:49.914
METHODOLOGY AND AND NOT PASSED

02:19:49.981 --> 02:19:51.316
TO TO BUILD MULTIPLE TIMES IN

02:19:51.382 --> 02:19:52.417
THE SAME DAY?

02:19:52.484 --> 02:19:53.284
VERSUS.

02:19:53.351 --> 02:19:54.786
HOW MANY CLINICS THAT DO YOU IN

02:19:54.853 --> 02:19:56.488
SO WE HAVE A RANGE BASED ON SORT

02:19:56.554 --> 02:19:58.556
OF AN ASSUMPTION AROUND WHO ASKS

02:19:58.623 --> 02:20:00.759
FOR THIS CHANGE? AND AND THAT

02:20:00.825 --> 02:20:02.460
RANGE IS GOING TO BE SOMEWHERE

02:20:02.527 --> 02:20:04.262
LIKELY BETWEEN YOU KNOW HUNDRED

02:20:04.329 --> 02:20:05.363
AND THREE HUNDRED MILLION.

02:20:05.430 --> 02:20:07.365
DEPENDING ON WHAT YOUR

02:20:07.432 --> 02:20:08.700
ASSUMPTIONS ARE AROUND THAT.

02:20:08.767 --> 02:20:09.901
BUT.

02:20:09.968 --> 02:20:11.603
AS WE FINALIZE THAT WILL MAKE

02:20:11.669 --> 02:20:13.037
SURE TO GET YOUR STAFF.

02:20:13.104 --> 02:20:14.272
AND AND WE ARE WORKING

02:20:14.339 --> 02:20:16.274
DILIGENTLY ON THAT NIGHT ME JUST

02:20:16.341 --> 02:20:18.176
AND BY ECHOING SENATOR ROTH'S

02:20:18.243 --> 02:20:20.111
COMMENTS I THINK A PILOT PROGRAM

02:20:20.178 --> 02:20:21.813
LOOKING AT A.

02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:23.581
SMALLER SIZE TO.

02:20:23.648 --> 02:20:25.283
REALLY DETERMINE WHAT THE

02:20:25.350 --> 02:20:26.551
FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS ARE FOR

02:20:26.618 --> 02:20:27.986
THE STATE WOULD BE.

02:20:28.052 --> 02:20:30.121
IN ORDER PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF

02:20:30.188 --> 02:20:31.589
THE CRISIS THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT

02:20:31.656 --> 02:20:32.657
OF US AS A STATE.

02:20:32.724 --> 02:20:35.026
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

02:20:35.093 --> 02:20:36.828
THANK YOU SIR SKINNER.

I APPRECIATE MY. COLLEAGUE FROM

02:20:41.699 --> 02:20:43.034
THE ASSEMBLIES COMMENTS ON THIS

02:20:43.101 --> 02:20:44.736
AND I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT

02:20:44.803 --> 02:20:45.937
IT'S AN ISSUE. BUT IT WOULD

02:20:46.004 --> 02:20:47.605
CLEARLY BE AN ISSUE IN RURAL

02:20:47.672 --> 02:20:49.407
AREAS JUST BECAUSE OF.

02:20:49.474 --> 02:20:51.409
DISTANCES IN SUCH TO THE

02:20:51.476 --> 02:20:52.343
CLINICS BUT IT'S ALSO AN ISSUE

02:20:52.410 --> 02:20:54.179
IN URBAN CLINICS.

02:20:54.245 --> 02:20:56.781
WE'RE DEALING WITH MOST THESE

02:20:56.848 --> 02:20:57.749
CLINICS ARE OBVIOUS THEY'RE

02:20:57.816 --> 02:20:58.550
DEALING WITH LOW INCOME

02:20:58.616 --> 02:21:00.518
POPULATIONS THEY ARE AS.

02:21:00.585 --> 02:21:02.153
AS I TALKED ABOUT IN THE.

02:21:02.220 --> 02:21:04.222
.

02:21:04.289 --> 02:21:07.058
FOOD BANK ITEM IT'S.

02:21:07.125 --> 02:21:08.493
THE WORKING POOR IN MANY OF

02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:10.128
THESE FAMILIES THE.

02:21:10.195 --> 02:21:11.129
PEOPLE WHO ARE.

02:21:11.196 --> 02:21:12.897
.

02:21:12.964 --> 02:21:14.465
THEY'RE WORKING SIXTY HOURS

02:21:14.532 --> 02:21:15.900
EIGHTY HOUR WEEKS THEY'D

02:21:15.967 --> 02:21:17.702
RELIEVED VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM

02:21:17.769 --> 02:21:20.071
TO. GET INTO THE CLINIC IN THE

02:21:20.138 --> 02:21:23.041
FIRST PLACE AND ONCE THEY GET IN

02:21:23.107 --> 02:21:25.677
OBVIOUSLY ARE CLINICS WANT TO

02:21:25.743 --> 02:21:28.246
TRY TO PROVIDE. AS MUCH SERVICES

02:21:28.313 --> 02:21:30.615
POSSIBLE AT THE POINT THAT THEY

02:21:30.682 --> 02:21:32.150
HAVE THE CLIENT PRESENT

02:21:32.217 --> 02:21:33.284
AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE MENTAL

02:21:33.351 --> 02:21:34.686
HEALTH NEEDS.

02:21:34.752 --> 02:21:36.120
YOU CAN OFTEN TIMES HAVE A

02:21:36.187 --> 02:21:37.956
CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE.

02:21:38.022 --> 02:21:39.991
PERHAPS THE PATIENT IS.

02:21:40.058 --> 02:21:41.759
THAT IS

02:21:41.826 --> 02:21:43.728
SOMETHING THAT THEIR PRIMARY

02:21:43.795 --> 02:21:45.129
CARE PROVIDER HAS TO PUSH THEM A

02:21:45.196 --> 02:21:49.033
BIT TO SEEK AND SO TO HAVE TO

02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:50.768
EXPECT THAT THE.

02:21:50.835 --> 02:21:52.537
TO RESCHEDULE IN RETURN ON A

02:21:52.604 --> 02:21:53.905
DIFFERENT DAY REALLY COMPLICATES

02:21:53.972 --> 02:21:55.874
TREATMENT.

02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:56.941
SO I THINK THAT.

02:21:57.008 --> 02:21:58.176
THIS IS A.

02:21:58.243 --> 02:22:01.012
AN IMPORTANT AREA IF WE WANT

02:22:01.079 --> 02:22:03.915
OUR CLINICS TO BE ABLE TO CAN.

02:22:03.982 --> 02:22:05.450

02:22:05.516 --> 02:22:07.919
OF CARE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT.

02:22:07.986 --> 02:22:08.586
AND.

02:22:08.653 --> 02:22:11.890
THAT REALLY ADDRESSES THE

02:22:11.956 --> 02:22:14.926
CLIENTELE THAT THEY'RE SERVING.

02:22:14.993 --> 02:22:16.928

THAT WE HAD A.

02:24:30.261 --> 02:24:31.963
SUCH A RISE IN WEST NILE VIRUS

02:24:32.030 --> 02:24:32.563
THAT WE WOULD LIKE ONE OF THE

02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:34.866
HIGHEST.

02:24:34.932 --> 02:24:37.869
IN THE NATION AND WE WE WE DID

02:24:37.935 --> 02:24:40.271
ALL THE STUDIES.

02:24:40.338 --> 02:24:40.872
OF WHERE THE OCCURRENCES WERE

02:24:40.938 --> 02:24:41.739
AND IRONICALLY IT WAS IN THE

02:24:41.806 --> 02:24:43.074
POORER PARTS OF.

02:24:43.141 --> 02:24:44.876
SANTA ANA WHERE OUR WATER SYSTEM

02:24:44.942 --> 02:24:46.711
PIPES WERE LEVEL AND WATER

02:24:46.778 --> 02:24:48.079

02:25:00.324 --> 02:25:01.692
KILLS.

02:25:01.759 --> 02:25:05.129
SO I THINK THIS IS WORTHWHILE

02:25:05.196 --> 02:25:05.963
BECAUSE WE DON'T NEED TO BE THE

PORTION. OF THE PROPOSALS WE

02:27:20.898 --> 02:27:21.866
ALSO BELIEVE THAT IF THIS

02:27:21.933 --> 02:27:23.701
PROPOSAL WERE TO MOVE FORWARD

02:27:23.768 --> 02:27:25.169
ADDITIONAL PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE

02:27:25.236 --> 02:27:27.171

SEVENTEEN THERE WERE THREE

02:27:53.731 --> 02:27:54.665
THOUSAND NEW CASES.

AND THE IN KERN COUNTY.

02:28:02.440 --> 02:28:05.176
SO IT'S A SERIOUS ISSUE THAT I

02:28:05.243 --> 02:28:07.345
APPRECIATE OF THAT THERE'S AN

02:28:07.411 --> 02:28:08.713
AUGMENTATION BEING DONE FOR AND

PROGRAM LIKE THIS.

02:28:36.807 --> 02:28:38.042
OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE

02:28:38.109 --> 02:28:39.543
IS SOME RESEARCH ACTIVITY GOING

02:28:39.610 --> 02:28:42.013

THE CURRENT MEDICAL OUT MIGHT BE

02:29:04.335 --> 02:29:06.003
A MORE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO. PUT

02:29:06.070 --> 02:29:07.471

AND I DO BELIEVE THAT TO KERN.

02:29:44.141 --> 02:29:46.277
FACILITIES SHOULD BE HANDY

02:29:46.344 --> 02:29:48.379

TOO WAS ESTABLISHED BY STATUTE

02:36:00.017 --> 02:36:02.786
THE SFU DOES NOT. AND.

02:36:02.853 --> 02:36:05.322

THE US IF YOU USE NO I'M

02:36:26.477 --> 02:36:27.711
QUESTIONING THE YOUTH THE NEED

02:36:27.778 --> 02:36:29.513
TO CREATE A THIRD. TYPE OF

02:36:30.748 --> 02:36:32.816

LIKE YOU TO TALK ABOUT IF WE.

02:36:37.321 --> 02:36:38.522

02:36:38.589 --> 02:36:39.857
TRIGGER IF WE.

02:36:39.923 --> 02:36:42.126
IF WE INSTEAD PUT THAT MONEY

INTO THE SFU CHART.

02:36:43.694 --> 02:36:47.998
AT SO UNDER THE CURRENT REVENUE

02:36:48.065 --> 02:36:49.299
ESTIMATES ADOPTED BY THE

02:36:49.366 --> 02:36:49.566
ASSEMBLY.

02:36:49.633 --> 02:36:52.770
IT WOULD BE UNDER THOSE REVENUE

02:36:52.836 --> 02:36:53.704
ESTIMATES WE WHAT THE STATE

02:36:53.771 --> 02:36:54.571
WOULD NOT HIT.

02:36:54.638 --> 02:36:56.640
EITHER OF THE THRESHOLDS.

02:36:56.707 --> 02:36:58.342
ESTABLISHED IN STATUTE.

02:36:58.408 --> 02:37:00.410
THAT WOULD REDUCE THE SALES TAX

02:37:00.477 --> 02:37:02.045
RATE IF THE SFU BOUNCE REACHES A

02:37:02.112 --> 02:37:02.746
CERTAIN SIZE.

02:37:02.813 --> 02:37:04.815
UNDER ONE OF THOSE THRESHOLDS

02:37:04.882 --> 02:37:06.583
IT'S IT'S FAIRLY CLOSE.

02:37:06.650 --> 02:37:08.218
BY AND SO YOU KNOW IF

02:37:08.285 --> 02:37:09.353
CONDITIONS CHANGE.

02:37:09.419 --> 02:37:11.188
IN THE FUTURE THEN IT COULD

02:37:11.255 --> 02:37:12.289
POTENTIALLY INCREASE THE

02:37:12.356 --> 02:37:13.690
LIKELIHOOD OF REACHING THAT

02:37:13.757 --> 02:37:14.725
THRESHOLD BUT.

02:37:14.792 --> 02:37:16.426
UNDER THE CURRENT ESTIMATES IT

02:37:16.493 --> 02:37:17.561
THEY WOULD NOT OKAY SO TO

02:37:17.628 --> 02:37:19.263
SUMMARIZE THE REALLY ISN'T ANY

02:37:19.329 --> 02:37:21.298
REASON WHY WE NEED TO CREATE A

02:37:21.365 --> 02:37:22.800
THIRD TYPE OF RESERVE ACCOUNT.

02:37:22.866 --> 02:37:24.568

02:37:24.635 --> 02:37:26.270
THIS MONEY IN THE SFE YOU

02:37:26.336 --> 02:37:28.806
WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES THAT

02:37:28.872 --> 02:37:30.040
ACCURATE.

02:37:30.107 --> 02:37:31.141
BUT WHY WOULD DEFERRED TO THE

02:37:31.208 --> 02:37:32.943
ASSEMBLY ON THE POLICY MERITS OF

02:37:33.010 --> 02:37:35.279
THE PTSA BUT. I IT WOULD NOT

02:37:35.345 --> 02:37:37.080
HAVE ANY IMPACTS ON THE SALES

02:37:37.147 --> 02:37:38.649
TAX TRIGGERS UNDER THE CURRENT

02:37:38.715 --> 02:37:40.184

02:37:40.250 --> 02:37:41.852
BUT THANK YOU OF THE ARMY NOT

02:37:41.919 --> 02:37:43.086
OBVIOUSLY I AGREE WITH I

02:37:43.153 --> 02:37:44.054
DISAGREE WITH THE ASSEMBLIES

02:37:44.121 --> 02:37:45.322
POSITION I DON'T THINK WE NEED A

02:37:45.389 --> 02:37:46.924
THIRD TYPE OF RESERVE ACCOUNT

02:37:46.990 --> 02:37:50.294
AND. I EVEN IF WE WERE TO HIT

02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:50.627
THE TRIGGER.

02:37:50.694 --> 02:37:52.863
AND.

02:37:52.930 --> 02:37:54.865
WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REDUCE

02:37:54.932 --> 02:37:56.166
THE STATE SALES TAX RATE BY A

02:37:56.233 --> 02:37:57.434
QUARTER PERCENTAGE POINT I DON'T

02:37:57.501 --> 02:37:57.901
THINK THAT THAT'S AN

02:37:57.968 --> 02:37:59.536
INAPPROPRIATE ACTION FOR US TO

02:37:59.603 --> 02:38:01.205
TAKE. ANY YEAR THAT WE'RE

02:38:01.271 --> 02:38:02.472
DEALING WITH A NINE BILLION

02:38:02.539 --> 02:38:04.374
DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS.

02:38:04.441 --> 02:38:06.310
I THINK IT'S IT'S VERY FAIR TO

02:38:06.376 --> 02:38:07.811
RETURN SOME OF THAT A SMALL

02:38:07.878 --> 02:38:09.813
PERCENTAGE OF THAT. TO THE

02:38:09.880 --> 02:38:11.014
PEOPLE WHO ARE PAYING IT AND AS

02:38:11.081 --> 02:38:11.982
I UNDERSTAND IT IF WE WERE TO

02:38:12.049 --> 02:38:13.617
EVER SPEND DOWN THAT MONEY AND

02:38:13.684 --> 02:38:15.285
DRAW ON THAT RESERVE THE SALES

02:38:15.352 --> 02:38:16.987
TAX WOULD AUTOMATICALLY GO BACK

02:38:17.054 --> 02:38:18.689
UP. AS WE FELL BELOW THE TRIGGER

02:38:18.755 --> 02:38:21.358
THRESHOLD IS THAT RIGHT.

02:38:21.425 --> 02:38:21.992
THAT'S RIGHT THE ASSESSMENT IS

02:38:22.059 --> 02:38:23.894
MADE ANNUALLY OKAY WELL MISTER

02:38:23.961 --> 02:38:25.362
CHAIR I DON'T SEE ANY REASON WHY

02:38:25.429 --> 02:38:26.730
WE NEED A THIRD TYPE OF RESERVE

02:38:26.797 --> 02:38:28.332
ACCOUNT. ESPECIALLY IF THE

02:38:28.398 --> 02:38:30.334
REASON FOR CREATING IT WOULD BE

02:38:30.400 --> 02:38:31.802
TO AVOID REDUCING THE STATE

02:38:31.869 --> 02:38:32.502
SALES TAX RATE.

02:38:32.569 --> 02:38:35.606
THANK YOU.

OBVIOUSLY DEFERRED TO THE CHAIR

02:38:38.742 --> 02:38:39.943
AND THE ASSEMBLY ON THIS BUT

02:38:40.010 --> 02:38:41.979
JUST ONE TECHNICAL MATTER ABOUT

02:38:42.045 --> 02:38:44.147
THE PSA THE PSA IS SOMEONE OR

02:38:44.214 --> 02:38:45.315
SEVERAL OTHER.

02:38:45.382 --> 02:38:46.583
.

02:38:46.650 --> 02:38:47.918
FORMULA THAT WE HAVE IN THE

02:38:47.985 --> 02:38:49.453
BUDGET WHICH IS THAT IS DRIVEN

02:38:49.519 --> 02:38:51.588
OFF OF OUR REVENUE NUMBER AND SO

02:38:51.655 --> 02:38:52.756
WE HAVE SEVERAL TRUE UPS ON THE

02:38:52.823 --> 02:38:54.491
PSA DEPENDING ON WHERE WE LAND

02:38:54.558 --> 02:38:55.993
WITH OUR REVENUES. MY

02:38:56.059 --> 02:38:57.427
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

02:38:57.494 --> 02:38:59.196
ASSEMBLIES AND TAT THIS TO

02:38:59.263 --> 02:39:00.964
INCLUDE THIS GUYS.

02:39:01.031 --> 02:39:03.700
MECHANIZATION TO SEE WHAT THAT

02:39:03.767 --> 02:39:05.903
FINAL NUMBER WOULD BE ON SO THAT

02:39:05.969 --> 02:39:07.204
DURING THE TRUE UP WE WOULD MAKE

02:39:07.271 --> 02:39:10.440
SURE THAT THE BSA AND NOW IS AND.

02:39:10.507 --> 02:39:12.209
CONFORMING WITH OUR FINAL

02:39:12.276 --> 02:39:13.744
REVENUE NUMBERS.

02:39:13.810 --> 02:39:15.245

THE BSA THE S. F. E. YOU IN SO

02:39:19.349 --> 02:39:19.983
YOU CAN HAVE A FOUNTAIN.

02:39:20.050 --> 02:39:21.885
APPROACH

02:39:21.952 --> 02:39:23.720
SO WHEN YOU GET CLOSE TO THE MAX

02:39:23.787 --> 02:39:25.822
YOU'D THEN OPEN THE THIRTY CAL.

02:39:25.889 --> 02:39:26.990
AND SO I LIKE THE IDEA MORE

02:39:27.057 --> 02:39:27.691
SAVING.

02:39:27.758 --> 02:39:29.993
I THINK IT'S

02:39:30.060 --> 02:39:30.594
SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE LOOKING

02:39:30.661 --> 02:39:31.995
AT SO I'M.

02:39:32.062 --> 02:39:33.497
I'M NOT NEGATIVE TO THIS IDEA SO

02:39:33.563 --> 02:39:35.399
I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND IT.

02:39:35.465 --> 02:39:38.135
IS THIS GOOD FISCAL PRUDENCE OR

02:39:38.201 --> 02:39:41.438
IS IT A A A INDIAN RUN.

02:39:41.505 --> 02:39:42.839
SO THAT WERE DOING WHAT THE

02:39:42.906 --> 02:39:44.741
TAXPAYERS WANT US TO DO BUT WERE

02:39:44.808 --> 02:39:45.909
ALSO BEING SMART BUT POWER

02:39:45.976 --> 02:39:47.577
HANDLING OF.

02:39:47.644 --> 02:39:49.479
A FINANCES.

02:39:49.546 --> 02:39:51.081
I THINK ITS IT EFFORT TO

02:39:51.148 --> 02:39:53.550
CONTINUE TO. I ENCOURAGE MORE

02:39:53.617 --> 02:39:56.086
SAVING BY THE STATE.

02:39:56.153 --> 02:39:57.688
SO I'M WONDERING INSTEAD OF A

02:39:57.754 --> 02:39:59.423
THIRTY CAL.

02:39:59.489 --> 02:40:00.290
WHY DON'T WE JUST PUT THE MONEY

02:40:00.357 --> 02:40:01.591
INTO THE?

02:40:01.658 --> 02:40:04.061
PENSION PLAN.

02:40:04.127 --> 02:40:07.531
AS A PREPAYMENT WHICH WHEN YOU.

TO THE.

02:40:11.134 --> 02:40:13.837
PENSION PLAN AT A LATER YEAR BUT

02:40:13.904 --> 02:40:14.871
AT LEAST FOR MAKING THE WHAT

02:40:14.938 --> 02:40:16.873
SEVEN PERCENT ON YOUR MONEY.

02:40:16.940 --> 02:40:17.808
AND THEN YOU STILL HONOR THE

02:40:17.874 --> 02:40:21.812
THRESHOLDS.

AGAIN AS A LEGISLATURE WE COULD

02:40:23.447 --> 02:40:25.649
PROPOSE AND ANY PARTICULAR AYE

02:40:25.716 --> 02:40:26.750
BUT THAT'S NOT ITEM TYPE.

02:40:26.817 --> 02:40:29.553
BEFORE SO WE'RE DISCUSS.

DEFERRED MAINTENANCE.

02:40:53.176 --> 02:40:56.780
BRIAN BROWN ANALYST'S OFFICE A.

02:40:56.847 --> 02:40:58.482
THE GOVERNMENT MAY REVISION

02:40:58.548 --> 02:40:59.950
INCLUDED JUST OVER A BILLION

02:41:00.017 --> 02:41:01.585
DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND AS

02:41:06.690 --> 02:41:08.458
PLUS DEPARTMENT.

02:41:08.525 --> 02:41:09.793
THERE REALLY TWO ISSUES BEFORE

02:41:09.860 --> 02:41:11.428
YOU IN CONFERENCE FIRST IS THE

02:41:11.495 --> 02:41:13.230
FUNDING AMOUNT ITSELF. THE

02:41:13.296 --> 02:41:14.731
SENATE APPROVED THE FULL FUNDING

02:41:14.798 --> 02:41:17.401
PROPOSAL BY THE ADMINISTRATION

02:41:17.467 --> 02:41:18.935
WHERE THE ASSEMBLY REDUCE THE

02:41:19.002 --> 02:41:20.670
GENERAL FUND AMOUNT TO FIVE

02:41:20.737 --> 02:41:22.272
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS.

02:41:22.339 --> 02:41:23.807
THE SECOND ISSUE IS

02:41:23.874 --> 02:41:26.476
ACCOUNTABILITY RELATED BUDGET

02:41:26.543 --> 02:41:27.077
BILL LANGUAGE ADOPTED BY THE

02:41:27.144 --> 02:41:27.811
SENATE.

02:41:27.878 --> 02:41:30.580
THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WAS IN

02:41:30.647 --> 02:41:33.016
RESPONSE TO SOME CONCERNS RAISED.

02:41:33.083 --> 02:41:34.151
REGARDING ADMINISTRATION

02:41:34.217 --> 02:41:36.420
PROPOSAL AND INCLUDING THAT

02:41:36.486 --> 02:41:37.687
DESPITE THIS BEING A VERY LARGE

02:41:37.754 --> 02:41:38.789
PROPOSAL THERE IS ACTUALLY A

02:41:38.855 --> 02:41:40.257
LACK OF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION

02:41:40.323 --> 02:41:42.559
ON THE SPECIFIC PROJECTS BE.

02:41:42.626 --> 02:41:43.693
UNDERTAKEN WITH THIS BILLION

02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:45.495
DOLLARS AS WELL AS.

02:41:45.562 --> 02:41:46.696
SOME CONCERN THAT NOT ALL THE

02:41:46.763 --> 02:41:48.131
PROJECTS SEEM TO BE OF THE

02:41:48.198 --> 02:41:49.566
HIGHEST PRIORITY.

02:41:49.633 --> 02:41:51.935
AND THAT THE PROCESS ITSELF THE

02:41:52.002 --> 02:41:53.236
NOTIFICATION PROCESS WOULD WORK

02:41:53.303 --> 02:41:55.439
TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET

02:41:55.505 --> 02:41:56.106
COMMITTEE.

02:41:56.173 --> 02:41:58.075
WOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT

02:41:58.141 --> 02:41:59.609
OPPORTUNITY FOR LEGISLATIVE

02:41:59.676 --> 02:42:00.811
OVERSIGHT.

SO THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE.

02:42:04.948 --> 02:42:05.449
HAVE A COUPLE OF PIECES BUT

02:42:05.515 --> 02:42:07.451
WOULD. REQUIRE MORE CLEAR

02:42:07.517 --> 02:42:08.819
DEFINITION OF WHAT KIND OF

02:42:08.885 --> 02:42:10.854

THIS FUNDING AS WELL AS INCREASE

02:42:12.222 --> 02:42:13.523
SOME REPORTING CRIME AS THE

LEGISLATURE.

02:42:14.925 --> 02:42:15.792
WE RECOMMEND SORT OF A

02:42:15.859 --> 02:42:17.894
COMPROMISE PROPOSAL GIVEN SOME

THESE CONCERNS I I SHOULD SAY WE

STATE ASSET BUT GIVEN SOME THESE

02:42:30.407 --> 02:42:32.409
CONCERNS RAISED WE THINK AN

02:42:32.476 --> 02:42:34.144
APPROACH OF TAKING THE ASSEMBLY

02:42:34.211 --> 02:42:35.278

AS THE SENATE BUDGET BILL

02:42:39.983 --> 02:42:40.584

02:44:03.300 --> 02:44:05.068
CHRIS SLEEPS PARTNER FINANCE

02:44:05.135 --> 02:44:06.770
YET THAT THIS SO FUNDING CAME

02:44:06.836 --> 02:44:09.005
WITH THREE YEARS OF AVAILABILITY

02:44:09.072 --> 02:44:09.973
FOR FOR THE FUNDS BUT I MEAN

02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:11.241
THIS IS THE LAUNDRY LIST OF

02:44:11.308 --> 02:44:12.709
PROJECTS FOR RESTORE WITH THE

02:44:12.776 --> 02:44:13.944
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIAN WE

02:44:14.010 --> 02:44:15.812
MOVED DOWN. SO THERE WAS NO

02:44:15.879 --> 02:44:17.647
SPECIFIC PROJECTS LISTED THERE

02:44:17.714 --> 02:44:20.016
WAS NO TRIAGE IN YOUR PROJECTS.

02:44:20.083 --> 02:44:21.518
UNLIKE WHAT WE DID IN TWENTY

02:44:21.585 --> 02:44:23.086
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WHERE WE WERE

02:44:23.153 --> 02:44:24.387
TALKING ABOUT THE SACRAMENTO

02:44:24.454 --> 02:44:27.023
AREA PROJECTS.

02:44:27.090 --> 02:44:27.857
WHERE WE TALKED WHERE WE SPOKE

02:44:27.924 --> 02:44:29.459
ABOUT IT? AYE I THINK IT.

02:44:29.526 --> 02:44:30.360
YOUR.

02:44:30.427 --> 02:44:31.962
YOU MAY BE CONFUSING THE

02:44:32.028 --> 02:44:33.597
PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE FUND WITH

02:44:33.663 --> 02:44:34.564
THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

02:44:34.631 --> 02:44:35.665
ALLOCATION ALWAYS IS DIFFERENT

02:44:35.732 --> 02:44:36.800
SO SO THIS IS.

02:44:36.866 --> 02:44:38.802
THE SAME APPROACH WE USE FOR

02:44:38.868 --> 02:44:39.803
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE.

02:44:39.869 --> 02:44:43.740
TWO YEARS AGO.

02:44:43.807 --> 02:44:45.642
THEN MAYBE I AM TO IT'S NORMAL

02:44:45.709 --> 02:44:46.243
AND I'M COULD WE'VE HAD THAT

02:44:46.309 --> 02:44:47.911
WERE PROPOSALS RGARDING STATE

02:44:47.978 --> 02:44:49.145
BUILDINGS WHICH IS I THINK WHAT

02:44:49.212 --> 02:44:50.347
YOU'RE REFERENCING THIS IS FOR

02:44:50.413 --> 02:44:51.748
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND OUR

02:44:51.815 --> 02:44:53.717
PROPOSAL IS SIMILAR TO THE

02:44:53.783 --> 02:44:55.218
APPROACH THAT WE TOOK PREVIOUSLY

02:44:55.285 --> 02:44:56.987
WHICH ALLOWS FOR. THIRTY DAY

02:44:57.053 --> 02:44:58.755
NOTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT

02:44:58.822 --> 02:44:59.956
BEFORE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED.

02:45:00.023 --> 02:45:01.558
WELL I GUESS I COULD GET TO THE

02:45:01.625 --> 02:45:02.659
ME SPEAK TO THE JOY THAT'S THE

02:45:02.726 --> 02:45:04.261
JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET

02:45:04.327 --> 02:45:05.729
COMMITTEE. OKAY I'M THE ONE TO

02:45:05.795 --> 02:45:07.230
RAISE THE ISSUE ABOUT THAT

02:45:07.297 --> 02:45:08.632
BECAUSE AT THE TIME.

02:45:08.698 --> 02:45:10.567
I WAS NOT TOTALLY FAMILIAR WITH

02:45:10.634 --> 02:45:11.901
THE WAY THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE

02:45:11.968 --> 02:45:12.736
BUDGET COMMITTEE WERE I GUESS

02:45:12.802 --> 02:45:14.537
I'M GETTING THE POINT REGARDLESS

02:45:14.604 --> 02:45:15.405
OF WHICH ONE OF THESE IT IS WE

02:45:15.472 --> 02:45:17.007
HEARD SEVERAL.

02:45:17.073 --> 02:45:18.608
I WAS NOT TOTALLY FAMILIAR WITH

02:45:18.675 --> 02:45:19.609
THE WAY THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE

02:45:19.676 --> 02:45:20.443
BUDGET COMMITTEE WORKED AT THE

02:45:20.510 --> 02:45:22.279
TIME.

02:45:22.345 --> 02:45:23.480
I HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN

02:45:23.546 --> 02:45:24.848
INFORMED ABOUT THE WAY THE

02:45:24.914 --> 02:45:28.685
PROCESS WORKS.

02:45:28.752 --> 02:45:30.287
THE WAY THAT PROCESS WORKS

02:45:30.353 --> 02:45:32.289
BECAUSE ALTHOUGH. IT'S MY

02:45:32.355 --> 02:45:33.456
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE MODIFIED

02:45:33.523 --> 02:45:35.125
THE NOTIFICATION PERIOD A LITTLE

02:45:35.191 --> 02:45:36.326
BIT IN THE IN THE IN THE

02:45:36.393 --> 02:45:37.360
LANGUAGE THAT WAS PROPOSED AND

02:45:37.427 --> 02:45:38.762
I'M.

02:45:38.828 --> 02:45:40.730
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT TOO.

02:45:40.797 --> 02:45:42.065

02:45:49.039 --> 02:45:51.074
ABILITY TO PUT THE BRAKES ON.

02:45:51.141 --> 02:45:52.709
PROJECTS WHEN WE WERE NOT

02:45:52.776 --> 02:45:54.444
SPECIFICALLY INFORMED.

02:45:54.511 --> 02:45:56.112
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TRIAGE

02:45:56.179 --> 02:45:57.547
ING AND HAD A DIFFERENCE OF

02:45:57.614 --> 02:45:59.215
OPINION AS TO WHICH PROJECTS

02:45:59.282 --> 02:46:01.651

DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEED ACROSS

02:47:30.774 --> 02:47:32.308

02:47:32.375 --> 02:47:34.043
I DON'T RECALL THE SPECIFIC

02:47:34.110 --> 02:47:35.445
NUMBERS OFF TAUGHT MY HEAD BUT.

02:47:35.512 --> 02:47:37.113
.

02:47:37.180 --> 02:47:38.882
THE IT WHICH WE DISCUSSED AT THE

02:47:38.948 --> 02:47:39.716
TIME THAT THEY WERE THE SHARE OF

02:47:39.783 --> 02:47:41.017
THAT THAT WAS PACIFIC TAKALIK

02:47:41.084 --> 02:47:42.552
BILL AND THAT'S HOW IT CAME UP

02:47:42.619 --> 02:47:43.520
IN THAT CONTEXT.

02:47:43.586 --> 02:47:46.055
THE DEPARTMENT HAS INFORMED US

02:47:46.122 --> 02:47:48.024
THAT THEY THINK THAT REPORT OF

02:47:48.091 --> 02:47:48.658
THE LITTLE BIT OUTDATED AT THIS

02:47:48.725 --> 02:47:50.360
TIME SO THEY PROBABLY WANT TO GO

02:47:50.427 --> 02:47:52.128
OUT AND DO ANOTHER ASSESSMENT TO

02:47:52.195 --> 02:47:54.230
DETERMINE WHAT THE STATE WIDE

02:47:54.297 --> 02:47:55.532
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS ARE

02:47:55.598 --> 02:47:56.766

02:47:56.833 --> 02:47:58.835
ATTRIBUTABLE TO CAL EXPO. FOR

02:47:58.902 --> 02:48:00.637
THE INFORMATION I HAVE ON THAT

02:48:00.703 --> 02:48:03.540
STUDY WAS THAT IT WAS.

02:48:03.606 --> 02:48:05.942
COMMISSIONED QUICKLY. THAT IT

02:48:06.009 --> 02:48:07.677

TURN IT AROUND.

02:48:14.284 --> 02:48:15.418
SO I THINK YOUR SUGGESTION OF

02:48:15.485 --> 02:48:16.219
DOING ANOTHER STUDY MIGHT BE

02:48:16.286 --> 02:48:18.054

INCLUDING THE LEGISLATURE.

02:48:58.394 --> 02:49:00.096
THE HISTORY OF THAT PROVISION IS

02:49:00.163 --> 02:49:02.232
THAT FOR THE. TWO THOUSAND FOUR

02:49:02.298 --> 02:49:03.600

THIS FORMAT CHANGE WAS.

02:49:17.480 --> 02:49:18.548
NOT WELL RECEIVED BY THE

02:49:18.615 --> 02:49:20.149
LEGISLATURE.

02:49:20.216 --> 02:49:21.951
AND SO THEY ADDED PROVISIONAL

02:49:22.018 --> 02:49:22.719
LANGUAGE REQUIRING.

02:49:24.354 --> 02:49:25.755

WE ACTUALLY DELETE THIS

02:49:49.512 --> 02:49:51.447
PROVISION IN OUR BUDGET AND WORK

PRECISION MEDICINE A SEPARATE

02:55:57.413 --> 02:55:58.681
APART FROM SOME OF THE RESEARCH

02:55:58.748 --> 02:56:00.182

THIS IS A CORE FUNCTION OF

02:57:08.718 --> 02:57:10.252
GOVERNMENT EVERY NOTE THAT THE

02:57:10.319 --> 02:57:11.687

CONSTITUTIONALLY RECOGNIZED

02:57:13.356 --> 02:57:14.757
ENTITY. AND THAT ONE OF THEIR

02:57:14.824 --> 02:57:16.425
CORE MISSIONS IS THE CREATION OF

02:57:16.492 --> 02:57:18.227
NEW KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS AFFECTION

02:57:18.294 --> 02:57:20.329

CANCER RESEARCH FUND. THAT

02:57:30.039 --> 02:57:31.907
OPERATES OUT OF OFFICE OF THE

MEDICINE.

02:57:45.788 --> 02:57:47.590
IS AN EXPECTATION THAT WOULD

02:57:47.656 --> 02:57:48.491
HAVE ON GOING PUBLIC.

02:57:48.557 --> 02:57:53.262
DOLLARS.

02:57:53.329 --> 02:57:53.863
JUST OUR DEPARTMENT FINANCE A

02:57:53.929 --> 02:57:55.431
NOTE THE EXPECTATION IS THAT

02:57:55.498 --> 02:57:58.034
THEY IT IS A NONPROFIT ENTITY

02:57:58.100 --> 02:57:58.234
AND.

02:57:58.300 --> 02:57:59.568
WOULD BE.

02:57:59.635 --> 02:58:02.138
OPERATED OR OPERATIONAL BASED

02:58:02.204 --> 02:58:03.873
ON A PRIVATE DONATIONS GOING

THAT ALLOWS FOR.

02:58:07.109 --> 02:58:09.845
UNSPENT FUNDS TO DATE TO BE.

02:58:09.912 --> 02:58:11.113
CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS THE

02:58:11.180 --> 02:58:13.149
INSTITUTE IN THE EARLY YEARS OF

02:58:13.215 --> 02:58:14.617
STANDING UP BUT IT'S ENVISIONED

02:58:14.683 --> 02:58:16.185
TO BE KIND OF A A SELF

02:58:16.252 --> 02:58:17.119
SUSTAINING.

02:58:17.186 --> 02:58:18.954
PRE COMPETITIVE SPACE FOR IDEAS

02:58:19.021 --> 02:58:20.656

ISSUE WITH THE SENATE PROPOSAL

02:58:22.825 --> 02:58:25.461
IS BECAUSE IT INCLUDES A SUNSET.

02:58:25.528 --> 02:58:27.997
CORRECT WHICH IS ALSO.

02:58:28.064 --> 02:58:28.564
CREATES A NONPROFIT SPINOFF

02:58:28.631 --> 02:58:29.999
CORRECT.

02:58:30.066 --> 02:58:31.534
CORRECT THE THE CONCERN WITH THE

AND CONFUSED ABOUT THIS ONE AS

02:58:52.021 --> 02:58:53.589
WELL BUT.

02:58:53.656 --> 02:58:55.591

IS THOSE I'VE BEEN CONVINCED THAT IT'S I

02:59:04.266 --> 02:59:05.901
GUESS HERE TO STAY. MY

02:59:05.968 --> 02:59:07.303
UNDERSTANDING OF THE OF THIS

02:59:07.369 --> 02:59:10.172
PROPOSAL. IS THAT THIS IS AN

02:59:10.239 --> 02:59:11.907
OPPORTUNITY TO GET THIS.

02:59:11.974 --> 02:59:13.843
S. THING.

02:59:13.909 --> 02:59:15.845
STANDING UP ON ITS OWN.

02:59:15.911 --> 02:59:18.747
A AND THEN MOVING OFF OF THE.

02:59:18.814 --> 02:59:20.549
PUBLIC PAYROLL SO TO SPEAK AND

02:59:20.616 --> 02:59:22.151
INTO THE MAINSTREAM SO THAT IT

02:59:22.218 --> 02:59:23.986
CAN SOLICIT.

02:59:24.053 --> 02:59:26.388
A PRIVATE DONATIONS TO FURTHER

02:59:26.455 --> 02:59:27.957
THIS RESEARCH WHICH FRANKLY IS

02:59:28.023 --> 02:59:31.093
WHERE RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE AYE.

02:59:31.160 --> 02:59:32.862
I HAVE BECOME A CONVERT ON THE.

02:59:32.928 --> 02:59:34.296
ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE STATE

02:59:34.363 --> 02:59:36.632
SOME HOUSE AND SOMETIMES NEEDS

02:59:36.699 --> 02:59:38.534
TO SEED RESEARCH AND. I BECOME A

02:59:38.601 --> 02:59:40.336
CONVERT ON PRECISION MEDICINE I

02:59:40.402 --> 02:59:41.837
DO THINK THERE'S.

02:59:41.904 --> 02:59:43.506
THIS SEED MEDICINE SHOULD BE

02:59:43.572 --> 02:59:44.874
ENOUGH AND HOPEFULLY THIS

02:59:44.940 --> 02:59:46.842
INSTITUTE WILL STAND UP ON ITS

02:59:46.909 --> 02:59:49.712
OWN. I'M I'M I AM CONVINCED I'M

02:59:49.778 --> 02:59:51.046
HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I'M A LITTLE

02:59:51.113 --> 02:59:52.448
CONFUSED ON THE SUNSET DATE

02:59:52.515 --> 02:59:55.084
MYSELF AT THIS POINT SO. WE

02:59:55.151 --> 02:59:56.485
SHOULD PROBABLY TAKE A LOOK AT

02:59:56.552 --> 02:59:57.686
THAT DURING THE THE CONFERENCE

02:59:57.753 --> 02:59:59.355
PROCESS.

02:59:59.421 --> 03:00:00.723
THANK YOU MISTER BOB.

03:00:00.789 --> 03:00:03.993
THANK YOU.

03:00:04.059 --> 03:00:05.961
I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR

03:00:06.028 --> 03:00:09.532
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO. ON.

03:00:09.598 --> 03:00:11.667
JUST JUST TO UNDERSTAND THE

03:00:11.734 --> 03:00:15.704
LOGIC TO CREATE A. NEW INSTITUTE

03:00:15.771 --> 03:00:17.072
YOU HAVE THE UNIVERSITY OF

03:00:17.139 --> 03:00:19.241
CALIFORNIA THAT ALREADY HAS BEEN

03:00:19.308 --> 03:00:20.709
ADMINISTERING.

03:00:20.776 --> 03:00:22.545
THESE FUNDS.

03:00:22.611 --> 03:00:25.548
THEY SEEMED FULLY EQUIPPED WITH

03:00:25.614 --> 03:00:27.516
MANAGING THESE FUNDS AS WELL AS

03:00:27.583 --> 03:00:29.084
DOING THE RESEARCH COULD YOU.

03:00:29.151 --> 03:00:30.619
HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT

03:00:30.686 --> 03:00:32.555
PROBLEM HAS ARISEN THAT YOU'RE

03:00:32.621 --> 03:00:34.790
TRYING TO SOLVE TO CREATE A.

03:00:34.857 --> 03:00:36.492
COMPLETELY NEW BUREAUCRACY TO

03:00:36.559 --> 03:00:39.662
MANAGE THESE FUNDS.

03:00:39.728 --> 03:00:41.163
I THINK UP A LOT OF IT REALLY

03:00:41.230 --> 03:00:41.864
GOES TOWARDS.

03:00:41.931 --> 03:00:44.300
CREATING A SELF SUSTAINING.

03:00:44.366 --> 03:00:46.569
ENVIRONMENT GOING FORWARD WHERE

03:00:46.635 --> 03:00:48.337
THIS CAN CONTINUE BEYOND ONE

03:00:48.404 --> 03:00:49.104
TIME.

03:00:49.171 --> 03:00:51.607
ONETIME AUGMENTATIONS AND I

03:00:51.674 --> 03:00:53.475
THINK. TO DATE I THINK IT'S

03:00:53.542 --> 03:00:55.477
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ON SOME

03:00:55.544 --> 03:00:55.711
OF THE.

03:00:55.778 --> 03:00:58.747
RESEARCH PROJECTS AND THE ON

03:00:58.814 --> 03:00:59.448
ONE TIME.

03:00:59.515 --> 03:01:01.717
AUGMENTATIONS THAT WE'VE DONE A

03:01:01.784 --> 03:01:03.219
ONE TIME FUNDING HAS BEEN MET

03:01:03.285 --> 03:01:05.154
WITH PRIVATE DONATIONS IN AND.

03:01:05.221 --> 03:01:06.689
MATCHES SO WE DO THINK THAT

03:01:06.755 --> 03:01:09.658
THERE IS SUFFICIENT INTEREST IN

03:01:09.725 --> 03:01:11.126
A FUNDING THIS FROM ALTERNATIVE

03:01:11.193 --> 03:01:12.861
SOURCES SOURCES ON AN ONGOING

03:01:12.928 --> 03:01:15.097
BASIS AND THINK THAT THERE'S A.

03:01:15.164 --> 03:01:17.600
SIGNIFICANT VALUE TO CALIFORNIA

03:01:17.666 --> 03:01:19.969
TO IT TO DOING SO.

03:01:20.035 --> 03:01:22.571
UT YOU HAVE PHAM.

03:01:22.638 --> 03:01:23.739
A SITUATION WE HAVE THE

03:01:23.806 --> 03:01:24.707
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ALREADY.

03:01:24.773 --> 03:01:26.275
ON.

03:01:26.342 --> 03:01:29.078
RAISES FUNDS GETS AUGMENTATIONS.

03:01:29.144 --> 03:01:31.247
THEY ALSO QUITE.

03:01:31.313 --> 03:01:34.116
USE TO RAISING ADDITIONAL MONEY

03:01:34.183 --> 03:01:35.851
FOR THEIR.

03:01:35.918 --> 03:01:37.953
FURTHER RESEARCH TO WHY HAVE A

03:01:38.020 --> 03:01:39.655
NEW BUREAUCRACY VERSUS JUST

03:01:39.722 --> 03:01:40.990
LEAVING IT WITH THE UNIVERSITY

03:01:41.056 --> 03:01:43.158
OF CALIFORNIA. UNLESS IT DOES IT

03:01:43.225 --> 03:01:44.994
WOULD SEEM TO BE. AND NOT THE

03:01:45.060 --> 03:01:49.365
BEST USE OF A START UP FUNDS.

03:01:49.431 --> 03:01:50.032
I THINK.

03:01:50.099 --> 03:01:51.400
IN ADDITION.

03:01:51.467 --> 03:01:53.002
IT GOES BACK TO A LITTLE OF

03:01:53.068 --> 03:01:54.670
WHAT OF WHAT WE MENTION IN TERMS

03:01:54.737 --> 03:01:56.972
OF THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE

03:01:57.039 --> 03:01:59.608
NONPROFIT ENTITY AND THE.

03:01:59.675 --> 03:02:01.176
ABILITY TO BRING.

03:02:01.243 --> 03:02:02.878
TOGETHER IDEAS.

03:02:02.945 --> 03:02:03.912
THIS IS.

03:02:03.979 --> 03:02:06.081
REALLY AN AREA WHERE.

03:02:06.148 --> 03:02:07.616
THERE'S A LOT OF COMPETITION IN

03:02:07.683 --> 03:02:09.885
TERMS OF CONSTANTLY.

03:02:09.952 --> 03:02:11.453
INNOVATING AND.

03:02:11.520 --> 03:02:13.589
WE THINK THAT THIS NONPROFIT

03:02:13.656 --> 03:02:15.791
ENTITY AND THAT STRUCTURE WILL

03:02:15.858 --> 03:02:17.660
FACILITATE THE SHARING OF IDEAS

03:02:17.726 --> 03:02:20.195
ACROSS DIFFERENT ON HEALTH

03:02:20.262 --> 03:02:23.365
INDUSTRIES. ON. AND CREATE THAT

03:02:23.432 --> 03:02:25.501
THAT SELF SUSTAINING MODEL.

03:02:25.567 --> 03:02:27.036
I AM I AM JUST NO I THINK WE

03:02:27.102 --> 03:02:28.971
WERE TRYING TO REFLECT SOME OF

03:02:29.038 --> 03:02:30.472
THE ON GOING DISCUSSIONS WE'VE

03:02:30.539 --> 03:02:32.074
HAD WITH THE LEGISLATURE EVERY

03:02:32.141 --> 03:02:33.042
YEAR I'VE BEEN IN CONFERENCE

03:02:33.108 --> 03:02:34.310
THIS IS BEEN ONE OF THE ISSUES

03:02:34.376 --> 03:02:35.911
THAT WE'VE ADDRESSED AND SO WE

03:02:35.978 --> 03:02:37.313
REALLY WANTED TO LOOK AT NEW.

03:02:37.379 --> 03:02:38.681
GOVERNANCE MODEL

03:02:38.747 --> 03:02:41.817
ON THAT WOULD TAKE IT OUT OF OUT

03:02:41.884 --> 03:02:43.352
IN THE STATE.

03:02:43.419 --> 03:02:45.287
I'D KNOW THAT I'M IN THE TIME

03:02:45.354 --> 03:02:46.689
WE'VE PROVIDED FUNDING FOR

03:02:46.755 --> 03:02:48.557
PRECISION MEDICINE MEDICINE THEY

03:02:48.624 --> 03:02:50.993
HAVE MADE FINDINGS IN THE AREAS

03:02:51.060 --> 03:02:52.294
OF CHILDHOOD CANCER ACUTE

03:02:52.361 --> 03:02:54.063
INFECTIOUS DISEASES.

03:02:54.129 --> 03:02:56.332
HYPERTENSION DEPRESSION PROSTATE

03:02:56.398 --> 03:02:57.599
CANCER GENETIC DISORDERS

03:02:57.666 --> 03:02:59.368
DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURY STROKE

03:02:59.435 --> 03:03:00.602
HEART DISEASE AND MULTIPLE

03:03:00.669 --> 03:03:02.004
SCLEROSIS.

03:03:02.071 --> 03:03:03.305
SO THE WORK THEY'RE DOING IS

03:03:03.372 --> 03:03:05.074
REALLY INNOVATIVE AND WE'D LIKE

03:03:05.140 --> 03:03:07.142
TO CONTINUE IT.

03:03:07.209 --> 03:03:09.278
THANK YOU FOR THAT FEEDBACK I

03:03:09.345 --> 03:03:10.479
MEAN THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S

03:03:10.546 --> 03:03:14.283
IN CONFERENCE EVERY YEAR TO. IS.

03:03:14.350 --> 03:03:15.617
THE DEPARTMENT GONNA PROPOSE

03:03:15.684 --> 03:03:17.052
SPINNING OFF A GOOD CHUNK OF THE

03:03:17.119 --> 03:03:18.620
UNIVERSITY INTO A PRIVATE

03:03:18.687 --> 03:03:20.522
NONPROFIT TO DO RESEARCH IS THAT

03:03:20.589 --> 03:03:22.891
WHERE WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS.

03:03:22.958 --> 03:03:24.426
MY POINT SIMPLY WAS THAT WE ARE

03:03:24.493 --> 03:03:25.928
TRYING TO REFLECT WHAT WE HEARD

03:03:25.994 --> 03:03:27.363
AND CONFERENCE WHICH WAS AND.

03:03:27.429 --> 03:03:29.565
AND UNCOMFORTABLE LESS WITH IT

03:03:29.631 --> 03:03:31.333
BEING WITHIN A STATE ENTITY AND

03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:32.735
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE PROPOSED THIS

03:03:32.801 --> 03:03:33.669
NEW GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE.

03:03:33.736 --> 03:03:37.039
SENATE MITCHELL.

03:03:37.106 --> 03:03:38.607
I AS YOU REYES OF THE ROLE OF

03:03:38.674 --> 03:03:39.875
YOU SEE I'M CURIOUS ABOUT THE

03:03:39.942 --> 03:03:41.844
ADMIN RATE IF WHAT YOU THINK THE

03:03:41.910 --> 03:03:42.911
ADMIN RIGHT WOULD BE FOR THIS

03:03:42.978 --> 03:03:44.913
NEW ORGANIZATION. AND PREPARE TO

INDIVIDUALIZED RESEARCH.

03:03:51.353 --> 03:03:52.287
WE DON'T HAVE THAT SENATOR

03:04:16.078 --> 03:04:17.346
OF THE GOING TO WHERE THEY'VE

03:04:17.413 --> 03:04:19.148
BEEN ISSUED.

03:04:19.214 --> 03:04:24.119

COULD. MITIGATE TOWARD

03:04:44.173 --> 03:04:46.241
ESTABLISHING A NONPROFIT SO THAT

03:04:46.308 --> 03:04:48.177
ELIMINATES THE.

03:04:48.243 --> 03:04:50.879
CONCERN THAT UC'S SIMPLY

03:04:50.946 --> 03:04:52.381

GENESIS OF THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT

03:19:00.828 --> 03:19:02.063
OF THAT EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTY

03:19:02.130 --> 03:19:03.264

03:19:27.422 --> 03:19:28.222
