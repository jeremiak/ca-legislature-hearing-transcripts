INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION. THIS PROPOSAL WAS INITIALLY CONTAINED IN THE GOVERNOR AND THE GOVERNOR JANUARY PROPOSAL HOWEVER GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROPOSAL AND THE LOSS OF OUR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE SEASON DUE TO- CALL THAT NINETEEN. IT WAS DEFERRED IN JUNE IN ORDER TO ALLOW MORE TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER IT. THIS INCLUDES HAVING HEARING SUCH AS THIS ONE WE'RE HAVING TODAY AND THE ASSEMBLY HAD ONE LAST WEEK. I'D LIKE TO MAKE A NOTE TATIAN PRIMARILY FOR THE PUBLIC YOUR- AGENDAS MEMBERS SHOULD REFLECT THE CORRECTION IT WAS A CORRECTION THAT WAS MADE. IN THE A HEARING AGENDA. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL ASK FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION INNOVATION IS FOR TEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. AND FORTY FOUR POSITIONS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. AN ADDITIONAL FOUR POINT SIX MILLION AND TWENTY EIGHT POSITIONS IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AN ADDITIONAL FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION AND EIGHTEEN STAFF POSITIONS IN THE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE BUDGET AND I'M GOING. THIS IS AN OVERALL INCREASE OF NINETEEN POINT TWO MILLION AND NINETY F. T. E.'S BY THE END OF TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND FULL-IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW DEPARTMENT. THIS IS A CORRECTION FROM THE PREVIOUSLY NOTED ASK OF FORTY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION AND NINETY ADDITIONAL POSITIONS. AGAIN MEMBERS THIS CORRECTED INFORMATION IS ALREADY REFLECTED IN THE AGENDAS THE UPDATED AGENDAS THAT WERE SENT TO YOUR OFFICE YESTERDAY. SO BEFORE WE BEGIN I'D LIKE TO ASK OUR CULTURE FOR TODAY'S HEARING SENATORS THE BRACKET IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE SOME OPENING REMARKS SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I. THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE TODAY AND- CONDUCTING- EARLIER BUDGET HEARINGS I KNOW IT'S BEEN A AMERICA FOR YOU. ON I'M A PRETTY OF JOINT WITH OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE AND ON. ARM COMMITTEE ON BANKING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS I THINK IT'S- IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE GREAT. BETTER CLARITY AS I SHOULD STATE. I IT RELATES TO THE POLL PROPOSED ON THE TRAILER BILL BECAUSE IT'S- MANY QUESTIONS. SINCE THE INTER OF THE OF THIS MEASURE. OF WHY IS IT NECESSARY AND WE NEED BETTER CLARITY BECAUSE WE'RE ON AN IMPRESSION THAT DVO ALREADY HOUSING AUTHORITY. TO DO MUCH OF WHAT HAS BEEN REQUESTED THAN THIS TRAILER BILL SO SINCE THE LACK OF- ALLEGED OPPORTUNITY HAVE HEARINGS ON THIS WE APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION SO I LOOK FORWARD TO POSING SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS TO DIRECTOR ALVAREZ TO COMMISSIONER ALVAREZ AS WELL AS- OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THIS. ARE HEARING TODAY FROM YOU FOR THE SUB. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR A CALLING WHAT WE'RE GOING DO IS THE HEARING REALLY KIND OF INTO TWO SECTIONS- WE WILL FIRST HEAR ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. FROM OUR OUR USUAL PARTICIPANTS L. A. L. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS WELL AS COMMISSIONER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. THE SECOND SECTION WILL HEAR TESTIMONY FROM- REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU THE CALIFORNIA REINVESTMENT COALITION. THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION A WITH THAT WILL BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST PRESENTER I'D LIKE TO WELCOME OUR COMMISSIONER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF- BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. COMMISSIONER MANUEL ALVAREZ. GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARES AND SENATORS. MY NAME IS MANUAL ALVAREZ I AM THE COMMISSIONER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. PRIOR TO SOON ASSUMING MY CURRENT ROLE I SERVED IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CAPACITIES WITHIN CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES. INCLUDING A CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION ENFORCEMENT ATTORNEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AS WELL AS WITH THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. I'VE ALSO SERVED AS GENERAL COUNSEL TO A FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY COMPANY. SO I HAVE EXPERIENCED BOTH ADVISING OPERATORS AND ENTREPRENEURS ABOUT HOW TO COMPLY WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. I ALSO HAVE EXPERIENCE. PICKING UP THE TELEPHONE AND TALKING TO VICTIMS OF. FINANCIAL SCHEMES AND CRIMES AND SO THE TOPIC OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION. IS VERY MUCH NEAR AND DEAR TO ME. THANK YOU ALL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION. WE APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO DISCUSS THIS ONCE AGAIN WITH YOU SINCE THE LAST HEARING IN MAY. IN JANUARY THE GOVERNOR HIGHLIGHTED THE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA. TO BETTER PROTECT ITS OWN CONSUMERS. IT IS EVEN MORE URGENT TODAY. LATE IN AUGUST. WE KNOW THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZES THIS TO AS MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN LEADERS IN CONSUMER PROTECTION ANY KNOWLEDGE THIS PROPOSAL IS CONTINGENT FUNDING IN THIS YEAR'S STATE BUDGET PASSED IN JUNE. PAT ACTORS IN THE FINANCIAL INDUSTRY SPACE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEVERELY IMPAIR CONSUMER'S LIFE. A DECEPTIVE PRACTICE CAN MEAN YEARS OF DATA OR RUINED CREDIT OR WORSE LOSS OF THE HOME. WITH THE CAN NEVER BEING ABLE TO REACH SOLVENCY. THAT CAN AFFECT THE ABILITY TO RENT AN APARTMENT FOR EXAMPLE WHERE TO BUY A HOME. TO GO TO COLLEGE AND CAN NEGATIVELY AFFECT AN INDIVIDUAL'S MENTAL HEALTH AND OVERALL WELL BEING. SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS DE PRIORITIZED CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION EFFORTS. CLOSING KEEPERS CONSUMER PROTECTION EFFORTS AND SCUTTLING KEY RULES THAT OFFERED INCREASED CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THEREBY LEAVING CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS VULNERABLE. BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT CALIFORNIA DESERVES THIS IN ANY EVENT. AS THE LARGEST STATE ECONOMY AND THE COUNTRY IT IS WORTH CALIFORNIA TO HAVE A FINANCIAL REGULATOR WITH DIVERSE SET OF TOOLS AND CAPABILITIES. SINCE THE ONSET OF THE COVERT CHALLENGE THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT IS RECEIVED A 40% INCREASE IN CALLS AND COMPLAINTS FROM CONSUMERS. THOSE ARE JUST THE CONSUMERS WHO FIGURED OUT HOW TO FIND US. AND WE'RE NOT EVEN THROUGH THE WORST PART OF THE ECONOMIC RECESSION. TO BE CLEAR THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT RE ORGANIZED OR CREATE A NEW DEPARTMENT. THE PARTS OF THE DEPARTMENT THAT OPERATE TODAY WOULD CONTINUE TO OPERATE THE PROPOSAL DOES. AND IT ADDS TO THE DEPARTMENTS. EXISTING KEEP. AND REGULATORY FUNCTIONS. DODD FRANK VIBES THAT STATE FINANCIAL REGULATORS HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE PROVISIONS WITHIN DODD FRANK. AGAINST UNFAIR DECEPTIVE AND ABUSIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES. THAT REQUIREMENT IS ALREADY INCLUDED AND CONTEMPLATED BY DODD FRANK THIS PROPOSAL WOULD MAKE CLEAR AND EXPRESS DEVIDOS AUTHORITY IN THIS AREA. BUT LET ME STRESS THAT THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT NEW AND THE PENALTIES AND REMEDIES CONTEMPLATED BY THE PROPOSAL. ARE NOT NEW. I ALSO LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO HIGHLIGHT THE THREE CONCERNS THAT SOME STAKEHOLDERS HAVE RAISED ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. FIRST WITH RESPECT TO YOUR DATA OR THE PROHIBITION ON UNFAIR DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES. AGAIN THIS IS NOT A NEW LEGAL STANDARD. AND CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO DODD FRANK SHOULD ALREADY BE COMPLYING WITH THIS LAW AND THIS EXPECTATION. SHOULD NOT BE SCARY. THIS IS THERE IS NO INTENTION TO PURSUE GOTCHA OPPORTUNITIES. THIS MERELY PROVIDES CONSUMERS ANOTHER AVENUE FOR PROTECTION AND REDRESS. SECOND EXISTING LICENSEES HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS WOULD APPLY TO THEM WHEN THEY HAVE AN EXISTING LICENSING SCHEME. AGAIN THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER DODD FRANK HAS TO EXISTING STATE LICENSEES IS NOT NEW. MANY IF NOT MOST OF THEM HAVE ALREADY BEEN SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL YOU DOUBT PROVISIONS AND EXPECTATIONS. MOREOVER I AM HAPPY TO RELAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN HAVING PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH EXISTING LICENSEES TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS. THIRD THERE HAVE OF COURSE BEEN QUESTIONS ABOUT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. IT HERE TOO I AM UP TO. THAT WE CAN FIND AGREEMENT. WE HAVE RECEIVED A PROPOSAL FROM LEGISLATIVE STAFF WE HAVE WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DISCUSSING MERITS WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION AND HAVING REVIEWED THE PROPOSAL IN THE LANGUAGE I'M CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN REACH. A WORKABLE AGREEMENT. THERE ARE SOME CONSUMER FINANCIAL BUSINESSES THAT WILL HARM CONSUMERS AND BENEFIT FROM NO REGULATION OR VERY LIGHT REGULATION. THOSE BUSINESSES AND THOSE PRODUCTS WOULD COME UNDER DEVIDOS UMBRELLA UNDER THIS PROPOSAL. AND AS A RESULT SOME OF COURSE WILL ALWAYS REMAIN OPPOSED BECAUSE THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO MONITOR PREVIOUSLY UNREGULATED ACTIVITIES. WE NOW SKETCH OUT IN BROAD BRUSHSTROKES. THE PROPOSAL ITSELF. THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES RESOURCES FOR RESEARCH GREATER COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND OUTREACH IN AN OMBUDSPERSON FUNCTION. AS WELL AS AN INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY OFFICE FOCUSED ON EMERGING AND CHANGING FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THE MARKETPLACE. THE TRAILER BILL OUTLINES HOW DEPARTMENTS EXPANDED OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY WOULD FUNCTION. CURRENTLY THE DEPARTMENT'S REGULATION IS ROOTED IN LICENSING STATUS WHEN A CONSUMER HAS A COMPLAINT THE FIRST QUESTION BUT THE DEPARTMENT ASKS IS WHETHER THAT BUSINESS HAS THE LICENSE FOR SHOULD HAVE A LICENSE. IF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL BUSINESS DOES NOT FALL SQUARELY WITHIN A PRESCRIPTIVE DEFINITION IN STATUTE. D. B. O. DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION. OR ABILITY FOREIGN FORTUNATE FORTY OVER THAT ENTITY. AND DDO CANNOT ACT. REGARD DECEPTIVE OR FAR TRY TO PRACTICE BY A CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROVIDE IT IS NOT LICENSED RADIO. EVEN IF ARE BEING HARMED. THE TRAILER PROVIDES FOR COMMISSION OF THE NEED. THE REQUIRED CURRENT ON MY FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO REGISTER WITH THE DEPARTMENT. EXAMPLES OF SUCH CURRENTLY UNLICENSED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES MIGHT INCLUDE. DEBT COLLECTORS THAT RESOLUTION SERVICE PROVIDERS CREDIT REPAIR AGENCIES. FOR INCOME SHARE PROVIDERS. THE DEPARTMENT THE REGISTRATION WOULD BE ABLE TO SUPERVISE THESE NEW COVERED PERSONS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH CONSUMER LAWS. YEAH THE KERN DRAFT OF THE TREE BILL WOULD OFFER THE TO ENFORCE TO AT AS TO ALL THOSE THE DEPARTMENT PURVIEW. CURRENT LICENSE. IN WE INVEST A CAP CONSUMERS PROTECT BY AN LEVEL OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION. THE DEPARTMENT WOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THESE LAWS IN THE LEARN INFORMATION ABOUT CURRENTLY UNREGULATED OR NEW INDUSTRIES THROUGH THE REGISTRATION PROCESS. ARMED WITH THAT INFORMATION WE CAN OF COURSE AND WHAT EXPECTED TO BETTER PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER AND HOW THE BEST STRUCTURE FUTURE LICENSING PROGRAMS. NOW LET ME TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THE PROPOSAL STRIVES TO BALANCE. ACTION WITH INNOVATION. THE PROPOSAL SEEKS TO BALANCE CONSUMER PROTECTION ON THE ONE HAND AND INNOVATION BY CREATING. AND OF INNOVATION THAT WOULD REPORT DIRECTLY INTO THE COMMISSIONER. AND THAT OFFICES MANDATE WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY TO KEEP ITS FINGER ON THE PULSE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN INNOVATION IN FINANCIAL SERVICES. AND TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A HEALTHY FEEDBACK LOOP THE- WHAT IS IN THE MARKET PLACE WITH RESPECT TO INNOVATION IN HOW THE DEPARTMENT IS REACTING TO RAPID CHANGES IN THE MARKET PLACE. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN INNOVATION AND REGULATORY ACTIVITIES SO THAT EMERGING ACT IDEAS CAN BE VETTED EARLY. AND THOROUGHLY. AND THE REGULATORY HURDLES COULD BE IDENTIFIED IN A COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT. THIS WOULD ALLOW CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS TO REAP THE BENEFITS. OF NEW PRODUCTS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES WELL THE DEPARTMENT WORKS IN THE BACKGROUND TO HELP INSURE THAT THESE PRODUCTS. ARE SAFE FOR CALIFORNIANS. IN CONCLUSION I'D AGAIN LIKE TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US OVER THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS. THE LANGUAGES FIRST MADE PUBLIC IN FEBRUARY. SINCE THEN WE'VE TAKEN A VARIETY OF AMENDMENTS ADDRESSING STAKEHOLDER CONCERNS. FROM WORKING WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS TO WORKING WITH BOTH ADVOCATES AND INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE INCREASED CLARITY. WE'VE COURSE HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE PROPOSAL. CALIFORNIANS JOYS TO WORLD CLASS ECONOMY. AND WE BELIEVE IT DESERVES A WORLD CLASS FINANCIAL REGULATORY DEPARTMENT. AND CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN BUT NOT THE FINAL ISSUES IN THE COMING DAYS AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SO MUCH COMMISSIONER WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THOSE UNTIL WE HEAR FROM THE OTHER TWO PANELISTS REPRESENTING THE L. A. ON AND FINANCE OUT NEXT MISS PETERS. REPRESENTING THE ONLY HEALTH OFFICE. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MR CO CHAIR SENATOR I JUST COMPUTERS WITH ALLEGED. AND OFFICE WE WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY SEVERAL ISSUES FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION AROUND THIS PROPOSAL. AND SPECIFICALLY ISSUES AROUND POLICY ISSUES AS WELL AS SOME FISCAL ISSUES AND UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE FUNDING LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT WOULD BE NEEDED. TO IMPLEMENT THE PROPOSAL. SO FIRST ON THE POLICY CONSIDERATIONS I'M- THE PROPOSAL WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO REGULATE MANY NEW COVERED PERSONS. AND THE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES ROUGHLY THAT THIS TO BE ABOUT NINE THOUSAND YOU COVERED PERSONS ALTHOUGH THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY. THAT NUMBER. AND THAT THESE AT PERCENT OFFER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS. I HAVE ENDED UP. OF TO BE ABLE TO. CERTAIN FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID. AND OTHER. AS WE SPOKE TO BY COMMISSION. I'M AND ONE THE ADMINISTRATION INDICATES OVERALL. OF THE PROPOSAL ARE THIS AS JAN. OR THE- INITIAL OF THE LINK. ON THE TRAILER LEGISLATION HAS BEEN. AMEND IN ACT TO LIMITS ASPECTS THE PURPLE. AS WELL AS CLEAR THE OVER PROPOSAL. AND THE SIGNET DEGREE OF COMFORT. OF THIS RIVER OVER ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. THE PARK OVERSIGHT ANTI OF. SUCH A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. AND SO FOR. I AM WE THINK THE LOGISTICS SHE CAN. IN THAT LED. PRIOR ARE. HIM THAT THE PRO STRUCTURE ALL TO FISTS. LEGISLATIVE. HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE HAS OPTIONS TO INSURANCE PRIORITIES ARE MET. I'M AND TO ENSURE ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT AS WELL. ONE OPTION COULD BE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PUT MORE OF THE PROGRAM DETAILS INTO STATUTE RATHER THAN DEFERRING THIS ON THE DECISIONS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE REGULAR. ACCESS ALTERNATIVELY ALTERNATIVELY IN THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEVELOP THESE PROGRAMS THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS AS IT PROPOSES- BUT INSTEAD ESTABLISH MORE OF A BACK END TYPE OF OVERSIGHT OF ONGOING OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY PROCESS. SUCH AS HAVING THE NEW REGULATORY AUTHORITY SUNSET AFTER A PERIOD OF TIME IN ORDER TO ALLOW LEGISLATIVE REVIEW ON AN ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES TO DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH A PROGRAM SHOULD CONTINUE. OR IF CHANGE SHOULD BE. I'M IN THE EVALUATION THESE POLICY CONSIDERATIONS LEGISLATURE ALSO WANT TO BALANCE THE TIME NEEDED TO DEVELOP. A DETAILED PROPOSAL WITH THE DESIRE TO QUICKLY ESTABLISH CONSUMER PROTECTIONS. I'M GIVEN THAT COMPLEXITY OF THE PROPOSAL AND THAT THE CODE PANDEMIC HAS TRUNCATED THE USUAL BUDGET AND POLICY PROCESSES. THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER TAKING MORE TIME TO EVALUATE AND WEIGH IN ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROGRAMS AND STATE RESPONSIBILITIES. I'M IN PARTICULAR IF THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES TO GO THE ROUTE OF PUTTING MORE OF THIS INFORMATION INTO STATE LAW RATHER THAN DEFERRING THE DECISIONS TO THE REGULATORY PROCESS. I'M IN THE LEGISLATURE WORD WHAT MORE TIME YOU COULD CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL AND THE NEXT I JUST IT SESSION. AND IT COULD NOT CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ADMINISTRATION ON REFINING THE PROPOSAL IN THE MEANTIME. I IN THE THIRD POLICY CONSIDERATION IS TO CONSIDER THE STATE VERSUS FEDERAL. I'M SORRYKEY JUSTIFICATION PROVIDED BY THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS THAT WOULD ALLOW THE STATE TO FILL A REGULATORY ROLE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN A STEP BACK FROM IMPLEMENTING BY IT'S POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIONS COULD TAKE A MORE PROACTIVE ROLE. IN ENFORCING FEDERAL FINANCIAL REGULATIONS AND SO THIS COULD RAISE THE QUESTION OF HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL VALUE IS BEING ADDED FOR THE STATE'S UPPER ON TOP OF FEDERAL EFFORTS. NOW THE SECOND SET OF CONSIDERATIONS THAT WE WANT TO RAISE FOR YOU RELATE TO THE FUNDING FOR THE PROGRAM. AS HAS BEEN INDICATED THE TRAILER LEGISLATION HAS. BEEN AMENDED IT VERY SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE ORIGINAL PROPOSED VERSION. HOWEVER THE MINISTRATION HAS NOT PROVIDED AN UPDATED ESTIMATE OF THE FUNDING NEEDED. TIME TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM THAT WOULD ALIGN WITH THE- ACTUAL TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT'S BEING PUT FORWARD- TODAY. AND SO WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO CONSIDER THREE STOPS WHEN DETERMINING THE FUNDING IT PROVIDES. IF THERE IS AN AGREEMENT REACHED ON THE TRAILER LEGISLATION. THE FIRST I'M IS SCALING THE FUNDING TO THE FINAL TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND THEY JUST SAID THAT- PROPOSED FINDING AND THAT THE TIME ADMINISTRATION BELIEVED TO BE NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE LANGUAGE. HASN'T BEEN REALIGNED THE NEW VERSION OF THE LANGUAGE AND THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL CHANGES THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THE LANGUAGE I'M BEFORE A FINAL AGREEMENT IS REACHED. AND SO THE FINAL LANGUAGE WE THINK SHOULD JUST SCALE AND ALIGN WITH WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN THE AGREED UPON TIME TRAILER LEGISLATION. SECOND WE THINK IT WOULD BE WISE TO NOT COMMIT TO FUTURE FUNDING INCREASES. AT THIS TIME- ASISTIR NOTED IN YOUR STOPPAGE AND THAT THERE'S I'M OUT YOUR INCREASES TO THE LEVEL OF FUNDING. IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THIS ONE'S ACTUALLY BEEN SET ASIDE AND AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET PAN. AND ARE RESPONSIBLE TO THE MINISTRATION THROUGH EIGHT- JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE PROCESS- IN ORDER TO ACCESS THOSE FINES. AND THAT BUT WE THINK THAT NOT COMMITTING TO THE FUTURE OUT YOUR INCREASES OF THOSE TIMES WOULD BE PRUDENT. HI I'M THIS IS BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND WITH THOSE OUT YOUR COSTS WILL ACTUALLY BE. I'M FOR EXAMPLE THERE ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES IT WILL COVER ABOUT NINE THOUSAND NEW COVERED PERSONS OFFER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES- BUT BECAUSE THIS PROPOSAL REGULATE I CURRENTLY I'M REGULATED COMMUNITY. THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF COVERED PERSONS AND COULD DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY. I'M AND SECOND HAS NOTED. THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL DIFFERS A LOT OF THE DETAILS OF HOW THE PROGRAM SHOULD ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED. TO THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND THE WORKLOAD THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING THESE NEW PROGRAMS AND RESPONSIBILITIES WON'T BE KNOWN UNTIL THOSE REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED. AND THREE DIFFERING ANY DECISIONS ON HOW. YOUR WORKLOAD I'M WOULD BE PRUDENT. I AND THEN LAST YOU MAY WANT TO CAN IN WITH PENDING LET IN PARTICULAR NINE OH EIGHT BY. RIGHT HOUSE SKI WEIGHED AND SIGNIFICANTLY OVERLAP WITH THIS PROPOSAL. AND THAT BILL REQUIRES A LICENSURE PROGRAM FOR DEBT COLLECTORS WHERE ADDS THE TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL REQUIRES A REGISTRATION PROGRAM FOR DEBT COLLECTORS. I HAVE A WE SHOULD BE TWO DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AS SORT OF A LICENSURE PROGRAM BEING- A MORE ROBUST REGULATORY PROGRAM AND SO IT MIGHT NOT MAKE SENSE TO PROVIDE FUNDING. AND DVO OR THE NEW DEPARTMENT TO- START STANDING UP A REGISTRATION PROGRAM IF THE LEGISLATURE IS ALSO GOING TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD CHANGE THAT INTO A FULL LICENSURE PROGRAM- AND WE WOULD JUST NOW AND THAT AS IS THE TYPICAL PROCESS WITH ANY NEW LEGISLATION- THAT. THE FUNDING ASSOCIATED WITH THE DUCT. COLLECTOR PIECE COULD BE. THROUGH THE NEXT BUDGET THROUGH A BUDGET PROPOSED AS IS TYPICAL. I'M WITHOUT HAPPY DANCE ANY QUESTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM THE PARTMINER FINANCE AND THEN WE'LL OPEN IT UP- BLACKS ARE GOING TO OPEN IT UP AFTER- THE PANEL LIKE WE DID IN THE LAST SESSION. SO LET'S HEAR FROM THIS HARBISON WITH- FINANCES HARBISON. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS AND CHAIRS AND SENATORS. AND CAN REALLY HARBISON FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YEAH SURELY MANNING IS ALSO HERE WITH US REMOTELY TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO ECHO COMMISSIONER ALVAREZ'S GRATITUDE FOR PROVIDING US. THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS PROPOSAL WITH YOU TODAY I WOULD ALSO ESPECIALLY LIKE TO THANK THE LEGISLATIVE STAFF FOR THEIR TIME AND FEEDBACK AS THEY WORK WITH US TO REFINE AND IMPROVE THIS PROPOSAL. OVER MANY MONTHS AND THAT'S VERY UNUSUAL YEAR. I'M AS YOU KNOWN AS THE ELLIE- JUST MENTIONED THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT INCLUDES FUNDING IN A SET ASIDE ITEM. THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LEVELS THAT WE PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BZP. THE FUNDING IS INCLUDED IN OVERALL BUDGET TOTALS BUT IS NOT YET AVAILABLE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. IS CONTINGENT UPON THE LEGISLATORS APPROVAL AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNATURE OF THE RELATED LANGUAGE. WAS SUBSEQUENT NODES NOTIFICATION TO THE JAIL BC. I'D LIKE TO NOTE THIS IS NOT A GENERAL FUND REQUEST AN EXISTING LICENSEES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO PAY ANY OF THE COST FOR THIS PROPOSAL. THE COST OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION LAW PROGRAM WILL BE COVERED BY NEW COVERED PERSON REGISTRATION FEES. EXISTING ACCUMULATED SETTLEMENT REVENUES AND EVENTUALLY NEW SETTLEMENT REVENUES SENATOR MITCHELL THANK YOU FOR ANNOUNCING THE CORRECTIVE BUDGET REQUEST AMOUNT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING AND I'D LIKE TO REITERATE THAT. THE NUMBERS JUST IN CASE ANYONE HAS TUNED IN LATE. SO IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE REQUESTED FOR TEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND FORTY FOUR POSITIONS. IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. THE REQUESTED FOURTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION. AND AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY EIGHT POSITIONS SO THAT'S AN INCREASE OF FOUR POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS. IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THE TOTAL AMOUNT IS NINETEEN POINT THREE POSITIONS. AND IT'S AN ADDITIONAL EIGHTEEN POSITIONS. SO I HAVE FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE AND THAT BRINGS THE TOTAL O ALL POSITIONS TO DO NINETY. IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR NOT GOING THERE'S A SLIGHT DIP OF ABOUT A HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. ONCE ALL THE HIRING HAS BEEN COMPLETED THOSE ONE TIME COSTS DROP OFF. THESE AMOUNTS REFLECT A 15% INCREASE IN POSITIONS THAT FULL IMPLEMENTATION. AND A SEVENTEEN POINT 5% INCREASE IN BUDGETARY EXPENDITURES. NOT A 41% BUDGETARY INCREASE AS WAS POSTED IN THE FIRST VERSION OF THE AGENDA. AND WE ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE SENATE BUDGET STAFFER PUBLISHING THE CORRECTION. THIS IS A HIGH PRIORITY PROPOSAL FOR THE ADMINISTRATION- WE KNOW THAT IN DIFFICULT ECONOMIC TIMES SUCH AS THE ONE THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY IN. BAD ACTORS OFTEN PREY ON THOSE IN FINANCIAL DISTRESS. THIS THOSE MOST PROPORTIONATE. SR THOSE MOST DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED INCLUDE PEOPLE OF COLOR. YOUR CALIFORNIANS THOSE IN UNDER RESOURCED COMMUNITIES AND SENIORS.WE ARE SEEKING YOUR PARTNERSHIP IN PROVIDING CONSUMER PROTECTIONS TO THESE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS. BY AUTHORIZING RESOURCING THE DEPARTMENT TO DO THIS CRITICAL WORK. WE THINK THERE'S A PATH FORWARD ON THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT AN EXISTING LICENSEE ISSUES. AND WE WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH LEGISLATIVE STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS. OVER THE WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK TO RESOLVE THESE LAST TWO COMPONENTS OF THE PROPOSAL. TO ACHIEVE HE CONSUMER PROTECTION THE ADMINISTRATION IS SEEKING TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING NOW. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS HARBISON- BUT WHAT I THINK. IS PROBABLY MORE PRUDENT COLLEAGUES ALL OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS NOW OF THE COMMISSIONER FINANCE AND L. I'LL BE STARTING WITH THE CHAIR OF BANKING THAN GOING TO OTHER MEMBERS- AND THEN WE'LL GO TO TESTIMONY FROM THE PANEL BUT I WANTED YOU TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. TARGET YOUR QUESTIONS- AT THIS POINT TO THE COMMISSIONER ELLIE ON FINANCE WITH THAT SENATOR BRADLEY WILL START WITH YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I HAVE THREE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS FOR. COMMISSIONER ALVAREZ AND I APPRECIATE HIS PRESENTATION BUT I'M- LOOKING VIEWS- DOESN'T DODD FRANK ALREADY GIVE THE DEPARTMENT AUTHORITY TO BRING. ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST EXISTING LICENSEES ENGAGED. AND THE UNFAIR DECEPTIVE AND ABUSIVE PRACTICES. THANK YOU SENATOR YES DODD FRANK CURRENTLY AUTHORIZES CONTEMPLATES AN AUTHORIZES. STATE BANKING DEPARTMENTS TO PURSUE THOSE THOSE REMEDIES AS TO AS TO CURRENTLY LICENSED ENTITIES. OKAY AND DODD FRANK'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE TO. BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE- TWO THOUSAND AND TEN. AND TO THE BEST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE SHOWS DVO OR YOUR PREDECESSOR DEPARTMENTS DEPARTMENT CORPORATIONS ARE OF. FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EVER BROUGHT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AGAINST ONE OF THE LICENSEES. USED THE DOOR PROVIDE. VIA DOT. NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE CENTER OKAY. SO AM I UNDERSTANDING YOU JUST SIMPLY ADDING LANGUAGE TO EXISTING LAW TO GIVE YOU THE AUTHORITY THAT YOU ALREADY OUT BUT NEVER USE IT. CORRECT THE OBJECTIVE IS TO CLARIFY WHAT WOULD OTHER WHAT COULD OTHERWISE BE A CONFUSING PATCHWORK. SO THAT WE MORE CLEARLY HAVE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD IN STATE LAW. SO MY FINAL QUESTION SO. THIS TRAILER BILL SIMPLY RESTATES THE UW BOARDED OFFERINGS GIVE YOU OVER YOUR LICENSEES. OR WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE TRAILER BILL TRIES TO ADD SOME LANGUAGE TO CLARIFY THE AUTHORITY OR EXPAND UPON IT. WITHRESPECT TO EXISTING LICENSEES I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE- I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE OBJECTIVE IS TO- EXPANDED THE AUTHORITY EXPAND OR OTHERWISE A BRIDGE THE AUTHORITIES- GIVEN BY FEDERAL LAW. WHAT IT WOULD AGAIN STRIVE TO DO IS TO IMPOSE A LEVEL FIELD WRIST TO LICENSEES AS WELL AS THOSE ENTITIES ARE CURRENTLY UNREGULATED OR LIGHTLY REGULATED SO THE OBJECTIVE IS. CLARITY ACROSS THE BOARD AND STRIVING TOWARD A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. OKAY WELL I'M GOING TO I'M FAMILIAR WITH ANY OF YOUR LICENSEES OF EVER STATED THAT YOU DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE THAT AUTHORITY UNDER DODD FRANK SO I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. THE NECESSITY HERE OF THIS TRAILER BILL. ANY COMMENTS FROM HELLO. ON THAT POINT OR FINANCE. OKAY SCENE IS THAT IT SENATOR BRADFORD. THE MORE BUT I CAN NOT. ALL RIGHT. AND ONE OTHER QUESTION I CAN YOU GIVE ME AN UPDATE ON THE PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING CONCERNS FROM THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT THE LACK OF LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT BUILT. INTO YOUR PROPOSAL. YES CENTER WE HAVE- LAST- THE LAST UPDATE I RECEIVED THE DEPARTMENTS HAS RECEIVED PROPOSED LANGUAGE FROM SENATE SUCH AN ASSEMBLY STAFF- WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DISCUSSING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. CONSIDERING THE MERITS AS WELL AS THINKING THROUGH HOW BEST TO OPERATIONALIZE. SOME OF THE- SOME OF THE PROPOSALS- PROVIDED BY LEGISLATIVE STAFF- SO WELL I CANNOT COMMIT TO- ANYTHING- TODAY- BECAUSE WE ARE WE'RE STILL DISCUSSIN WITH WITH ADMINISTRATION AND LEADERSHIP WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION- I CAN SAY THAT HAVING HAVING LOOKED AT THE PROPOSAL AND HAVING THOUGHT ABOUT. ITS IMPLEMENTATION I AM- I'M CONFIDENT I'M I'M FAIRLY OPTIMISTIC THAT WE CAN FIND A PATH FORWARD. AND MY FINAL QUESTION WHAT MILESTONES ARE RESULT SURE WE LOOK FORWARD TO. BE ABLE TO MEASURE OUR SUCCESS HERE. CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MILESTONES. WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THE THREE YEAR PROGRESSION AND TERMS OF THE FOLLOWING HIGH LEVEL MILESTONES YEAR ONE- WE WOULD OF COURSE NEED TO START BY. BUILDING OUT THE NEW THE NEW DIVISIONS AND THEN YOU FUNCTIONS BY HIRING KEY LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AS WELL AS START STARTING TO BUILD OUT THE SKELETON STRUCTURE OF EACH NEW FUNCTIONS SUCH AS THE NEW COVERED PERSONS DIVISION AS WELL AS MARKET MONITORING FUNCTIONS. WE WOULD OF COURSE START TO SPIN OUT OF THE OFFICE OF FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION IN YEAR ONE AND SIX IN ENGAGEMENT SHORTLY THEREAFTER IN ADDITION STAKEHOLDERS. AND WE WOULD- LOOK AT TAKING NEW CONSUMER COMPLAINTS REGARDING NEW COVERED PERSONS AND START TO DEVELOP. A SENSE OF THAT MARKET PLACE SO YEAR ONE IS ABOUT STARTING TO BUILD OUT LEADERSHIP THE SKELETON OF THE STRUCTURE. AND STARTING TO GET- A BETTER SENSE OF THE LAY OF THE LAND YOUR TO WOULD BE FOCUSED ON COMMENCING- COMMENCING WITH REGULATIONS WHERE WHERE WARRANTED AND APPROPRIATE- WE WOULD ALSO SEEK TO SPEND UP THE EDUCATION OFFICE AND ADDITIONAL OUTREACH TO PARTICULAR POPULATIONS OF CALIFORNIANS SUCH AS NEW CALIFORNIANS. SENIORS AS WELL AS- STUDENTS. S. CONTINUE HIRING POSITIONS INTO THE SECOND YEAR AND WE WOULD EXPECT TO BEGIN- THE VISITATION WITH RESPECT TO NEW COVER PERSONS. UNDER UNDER A NEW REGISTRATION PROCESS. YOUR THREE WOULD BE ALL ABOUT FINALIZING REGULATIONS- WHERE WARRANTED AND FULLY IMPLEMENTING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS. AND CLOSING OUT CLOSER OUT REMAINING HIRING NEEDS SO TO READ YOUR ONES ABOUT. TILTING UP THE SKELETON STRUCTURE STARTING TO UNDERSTAND THE NEARLY OF THE LAND HERE TO USE IMPLEMENTATION WITH NEW REGULATIONS AND INCREASING VISITATION OF NEW COVERED PERSONS IN YOUR THREE IS ABOUT WRAPPING UP WRAPPING UP THAT- AND THAT THREE YEAR BUILD PERIOD. MISTER AND I WOULD JUST CONCLUDE ON I'M VERY SUPPORT OF A PORTIONS OF- THIS PROPOSAL THE GIVE YOU AUTHORITY AS IT RELATES TO THE UNLICENSED FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BUT I AM REALLY CONCERNED AND I THINK THIS JUST ADDS A NEW AUTHORITY AND I DON'T SEE WHAT PROBLEM EXISTS RIGHT NOW WITH YOUR CURRENT LICENSEES THAT JUSTIFIES THIS. ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE CHAIRMAN BRADFORD WILL MOVE ON TO SENATOR ROTH WILL BE FOLLOWED BY SENATOR NIELSEN. THANK YOU MADAM THANK YOU MANAGER AND GIVE MY MIKE THIS FELLA. YOU KNOW I'M- I'M ALWAYS CONCERNED WHEN WE PROPOSED TO ADD NEW GOVERNMENT. AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE A FAIRLY SUBSTANTIAL AND SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. IN OUR STATE THAT THE- FRANKLY- FAILING IN NEED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF HELP BOTH IN TERMS OF THE TIME AND ATTENTION. OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE TIME AND ATTENTION OF THIS LEGISLATURE. AND THE- AND SIGNIFICANT FUNDING ONGOING AND ADDED PROBABLY AS PART OF OUR BUDGET. BUT I TRIED TO AFTER I SPOKE TO FOLKS ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE YESTERDAY I TRIED LAST NIGHT TO GET MY HANDS AROUND IT AND WHAT'S- FRUSTRATING FOR ME IS THE LACK OF WRITTEN MATERIAL SINCE I DO READ OCCASIONALLY. TO DESCRIBE THE DETAIL OF THIS PROPOSAL AND MORE PARTICULARLY THE URGENCY AND THE SPECIFIC NEED NOW. FOR US TO BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE DOING AND TO TAKE TIME TO. TO PROCESS THIS. THROUGH THIS HOUSE AND SO I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION SINCE THEY DID TEACH ME I THINK YOU OUGHT TO ASK THEM. IS DID WE DO A NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE. EXACTLY OR APPROXIMATELY HOW MANY COMPLAINTS AND ENFORCEMENT CASES. DROPPED THROUGH THE CRACKS SINCE THE REDUCED FUNDING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL OF THE FEDERAL CFPB. ACTIVITIES IN THE APPARENT INABILITY OR UNWILLINGNESS OF OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL AND R. FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S TO. PICK UP THE SLACK CAN CONDUCT THESE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. THANK YOU SENATOR I AM NOT. OF THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF ANY NEEDS ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED- AT THE STATE LEVEL. THAT ACTUALLY POINTS TO ONE OF THE IN MY VIEW ONE OF THE CRITICAL PIECES OF THE PROPOSAL WHICH IS BROADLY SPEAKING THE TO TELL TOP A ROBUST MARKET MONITORING FUNCTION. AS A DEPARTMENT IS GOOD EXISTS TODAY WE DO NOT HAVE A GREAT MARKET MONITORING FUNCTION- WE DON'T REALLY HAVE GREAT CAPABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO- REACHING OUT INTO THE BROAD MARKET PLACE IN UNDERSTANDING- UNDERSTANDING OF THE MACRO LANDSCAPE OR THE IMPLICATIONS OF- ECONOMIC SHOCKS SUCH AS THE ONE THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW SO- I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS. WELL RECEIVED AND YOU KNOW MY VIEW POINTS TO SOME OF THE NEEDS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE FOR MORE ROBUST BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE MARKET MONITORING TYPE FUNCTIONS. WELL LET ME LET ME TRY TO ASK IT ANOTHER WAY I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE. YOU MENTIONED THE VIN OF 40% AND IN COMPLAIN THAT. HAS ASIDE EXPERT OR WITH A RECEIVED. WITH RESPECT TO THOSE COMPLAINTS HOWEVER THOSE COMPLAINTS DISTRIBUTED WITH REGARD TO THOSE ENTITIES THAT YOU CURRENTLY CURRENTLY LICENSE AND KNOWS. NEWLY FOR POTENTIAL NEWLY COVERED PERSONS I THINK THAT'S HOW WE DESCRIBE IT I WOULD CALL THEM POTENTIAL. LICENSEES OF REGISTRANTS. WARS OR SOMETHING ELSE. THANK YOU SENATOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE OF THE INCREASE OF COMPLIANCE IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY. EARLY SCATTERED- WE'VE BEEN- WE'VE WE'VE DONE NOT A DEEPER DIVE ASATRU CAUSING HOUSES OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT COME IN AND- D. THAT THE THRUST OF THE COMPLAINTS IS REALLY ALL OVER THE PLACE RANGING FROM- ACTIVITIES THAT WE CURRENTLY TOUCHES SUCH AS- MORTGAGE LENDING OR TRANSMISSION OF MONEY- AS WELL AS- VARIOUS ACTIVITIES THAT OU WE DON'T REALLY. ACTIVITIES ARE COMPANIES THAT WE DON'T. CURRENTLY TOUCH- FOR EXAMPLE IN THE POTENTIALLY THE NEGOTIATION OF THAT WERE PROMISES MADE WITH RESPECT TO- CREDIT RESTRUCTURING THINGS OF THAT NATURE- THERE ARE ALSO OF COURSE A SMATTERING OF COMPLAINTS RELATED TO- INCLUDING EXCUSE ME ALLEGATIONS OF OUTRIGHT FRAUD FOR EXAMPLE. IN THE OFFERING OF. THE SECURITIES AND- WITH RESPECT TO THOSE YOU KNOW THE ANSWER IS. THE ANSWER DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF SECURITY AN ALLEGATION AND AN ALL ALL THINGS OF THAT NATURE BUT THE UPSHOT IS THAT. LEAVE THE INCREASING INCOME HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE THERE'S THERE HASN'T BEEN- GREAT AMOUNT OF RHYME OR REASON TO THEM- EXCEPT TO SAY THAT THAT THE VOLUME OF COMPLAINTS HAS BEEN INCREASING OVER TIME. WELL I MEAN SECURITY SOME OF THAT'S SEC ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL I REALIZE THE STATE HAS POTENTIALLY SOME REAL I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE- WHAT THE RATIONALE AND THE REASON FOR THIS IS AND THAT'S WHY I GUESS MY QUESTION ABOUT THE 40% INCREASE IN COMPLAINTS. WELL LET ME TRY TO DRILL DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE HAVE ANY OF THE ISSUES. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THE CURRENT LICENSEES THE DPO. CANNOT AND HAS NOT. BEEN HANDLING IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. HERE. THIS THIS THIS GETS INTO- POTENTIALLY CONVERSATIONS AROUND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY- WHAT I CAN SAY BROADLY IS THAT. THERE HAVEN'T BEEN- I WOULD SAY THERE HAVEN'T BEEN MARKET CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO ACTIVITIES HAPPENING AT THE CURRENTLY LICENSE EVEN THIS LICENSE TO LEVELS- I THINK THE BROADER CONCERN IS WHAT TO DO ABOUT-THOSE THOSE AREAS THAT WE CURRENTLY ARE UNABLE TO TOUCH. WELL THAT'S THAT LEADS TO MY NEXT QUESTION THEN WHY NOT JUST FOCUS ON THE CURRENTLY UNLICENSED OR UNREGISTERED ENTITIES OF. PERHAPS THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE BUDGET REQUEST IN THE- SIZE OF THE GOVERNMENT. AGENCY THAT'S BEING PROPOSED WOULD REORGANIZE AGENCY THAT'S BEING PROPOSED. THANK YOU SENATOR I WOULD SUBMIT THAT AB DE THOSE SORTS OF INCREMENTAL CHANGES TO THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. PROBABLY DO NOT MARKEDLY CHANGE THE RESOURCE REQUEST- CURRENTLY PENDING- BUT IT DEFINITELY I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT. TO RECOGNIZE THAT PART OF WHAT THE PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ATTAIN IS A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WHICH IS- WHICH IS OF COURSE GOOD FOR CONSUMERS AS AS WELL AS THE MARKET PLACE- THE OBJECTIVE IS TO MINIMIZE CONFUSION IN THE MARKETPLACE THROUGH- A PASSWORD INTO AS BEST AS POSSIBLE AND WITHIN THE STRUCTURE OF EXISTING LICENSING REGIMES- APPLY AND APPLY THE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD- SOMETHING RESEMBLING PARITY. WELL YOU KNOW I I'M I'M TRYING TO I'M NOT AN ACCOUNTANT IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE- RUBIO HAS A- SPECIAL FUND CONDITION AND- IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF A HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION DOLLARS SOME OF WHICH WERE GOING TO USE I GUESS TO STAND UP THIS. THIS ENTITY AND I ASSUME THAT SPECIAL FUND WAS NOT SWEPT IS PART OF OUR- SEARCH FOR BUDGET MONEY IN THE LATEST. BUDGET ROUND WHERE WE WERE. SLEEPING JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE INCLUDING THE FLOOR TO FIND MONEY THAT ABOUT CORRECT. SURE ISN'T AS FAR AS I'M AWARE SENATOR YES SO IT IT IT IT DOES SOUND TO ME A BIT LIKE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STANDING UP SKELETONS CONSTRUCTORS AND- CREATING MARKET REVIEW- OFFICES TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS ANY. NEED FOR THE ORGANIZATION AND ANY ANY ANY. CONSULT NEED IN TERMS OF COMPLAINTS THAT WE'RE PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE HERE WAS THERE ANY SORT OF- GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION PLAN OR IF WE DON'T WANT TO CALL IT THAT ANY SORT OF WRITTEN REORGANIZATION PLAN THAT WAS THOUGHT THROUGH AND PREPARED AND REDUCE TO WRITING WITH RESPECT TO THIS. RATHER DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS WITH RESPECT TO BUSINESS OVERSIGHT AND THOSE ORGANIZATIONS. THAT WE TAKE INTO OUR OVERSIGHT- PURVIEW. THANK YOU SENATOR I'M HAPPY TO DISCUSS THE- THE PROCESS IN THE RATIONALE THAT WENT INTO DEVELOPING THE RESOURCE REQUESTS SELF- THE SHORT ANSWER IS. YES WE- WE UNDERTOOK A PROCESS AND OF COURSE THESE WERE THESE WERE PROJECTIONS BUT THEY WERE INFORMED PROJECTIONS. BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION. ABOUT WHAT THE UNIVERSE- WITH POTENTIALLY NEW COVERED PERSONS WILL LOOK LIKE IN THAT REGARD WE LOOK DOWN EVERYTHING FROM. DATA DATA PROVIDED BY THE C. F. P. B. WE RELIED ON CONVERSATIONS AND DATA FROM TRADE GROUPS AS WELL AS OTHER PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. PUBLICLY AVAILABLE SOURCES OF INFORMATION TO MAKE AN INFORMED ASSESSMENT ABOUT WHAT THE POTENTIAL UNIVERSE LOOKS LIKE USING NOT. USING THAT. SURE THAT PROJECTION LOANS- WE THEN RELIED ON THE IN LEADERSHIP WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT TODAY AND HOUSE QUESTION. GIVEN HOW WE CURRENTLY STAFFS IN RESOURCE OUR ACTIVITIES HOW WOULD WE RESOURCE THEIR DANCE THAT THIS PROJECTED NEED SO I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THERE WAS A AND THERE WAS A PROCESS AND I THINK IT WAS A SENSIBLE AND WELL INFORMED PROCESS- BUT- YOU ARE CORRECT AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS THAT THIS THIS IS AN INFORMED PROJECTION- THAT WILL. CONTINUE TO BE PERFORMED IN REVISED AS WE LEARN TO GET SMARTER ONE WHAT'S CONCERT TO ME IS THERE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE A WRITTEN DOCUMENT AND SOMETIMES WHEN YOU. WHEN YOU DEBATE THESE ISSUES INTERNALLY IN AN ORGANIZATION I'M OLD ENOUGH TO HAVE BEEN IN A FEW OF THEM- FRICTION WITNESSES COME OUT YOU IDENTIFY HOLES. TO PLUG HOLES YOU FIGURE OUT. WORST CASE SCENARIO AND YOU FOR AND YOU REDUCE IT TO WRITING. AND IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE THAT SORT OF THOUGHTFUL AND I'M NOT SAYING IT WASN'T THOUGHTFUL BUT- IT WASN'T THOUGHTFUL IN THE SENSE THAT THERE WAS A WRITTEN PRODUCT THAT WAS PRODUCED THAT THAT WE IS A LEGISLATURE. COULD REVIEW TO UNDERSTAND THE THOUGHT PROCESS AND THE NOT THE ANALYSIS THAT WENT INTO THIS- GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATION PROPOSAL. AND THE PROBLEMS THAT SEEKS TO SOLVE AND- I GUESS WHEN I LOOK AT THE TIMELINE YOUR ONE TWO THREE STANDING UP A SKELETON STRUCTURE. YOUR ONE DOING REGULATIONS IN YEAR TWO YEAR THREE FINALIZING THE REGULATIONS AND PRESUMABLY BEGINNING TO DO WHATEVER IT IS YOU'RE GOING TO DO WITH THIS POPULATION WHOEVER THEY ARE WHAT WHATEVER THEY ARE. WHAT MAYBE THAT SUGGESTS THAT WE DON'T NEED TO RUSH THIS PROPOSAL THIS YEAR AND MAYBE WE NEED TO TAKE THIS INTO THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE CYCLE AND BUDGET YEAR AND CONDUCT THE NORMAL BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE HEARINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE IN PRIOR GOVERNMENT REORGANIZATIONS- I HAVE WAS TELLING SOMEONE YESTERDAY AS PART OF MY LIFE SIX YEARS AND BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE FOR AS A CHAIR MY COLLEAGUES AND I SPENT SEVERAL. SESSIONS ON THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION REORGANIZATION WHICH APPEARS TO BE TO HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY. WITH A SLIGHTLY DIG DIFFERENT DEGREE OF ANALYSIS AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT ANALYSIS THAT SAME PROCESS AND ANALYSIS SHOULD NOT BE UTILIZED IN THIS CASE. FROM WHICH WAS NOT A QUESTION I APOLOGIZE FOR THE STATEMENT LET ME ASK A QUESTION NOW ABOUT REGULATORY AUTHORITY IN LOOKING AT OUR- SENATE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET IN FISCAL REVIEW ANALYSIS ON PAGE THREE. IT REFERENCES THE FACT THAT THE NEW ORGANIZATION WILL BE AUTHORIZED- TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS IDENTIFYING YOU DEATHS IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFER OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. BUT IN THE SAME PARAGRAPH IT STATES THAT THE TRAILER BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE THE ORGANIZATION TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS DEFINING YOU DEPP'S BEFORE THE DEPARTMENT NAY ENFORCE YOU DE VIOLATIONS. DON'T YOU THINK IT ODD THAT REGULATIONS WOULD NOT BE PROMULGATED HAVING TO DO WITH ENFORCEMENT POLICIES- SO THAT THE ENTITIES BEING. MMHM REGULATED WHETHER THEY ARE CURRENT LICENSEES ARE THOSE BEING REGULATED OR THOSE THAT ARE PROPOSED TO BE REGULATED. THANK YOU SENATOR I DO NOT THINK IN THAT ODD- BECAUSE- THE- THE THRUSTS OF A PROHIBITION ON UNFAIR DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES PRESUMES THAT. SUCH PRACTICES CAN CAN SHIFT OVER TIME ARE VALUABLE OVER TIME AND SO THE ACT OF THE FINING- A PARTICULAR ACT OR PRACTICE- DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN. THAT YOU STOP FUTURE- UNTOLD A DECEPTIVE OR UNFAIR ACTS OR PRACTICES- AND DIE YOU KNOW IN THIS REGARD I HAVE TO RELY A LITTLE BIT ON MY PRIOR EXPERIENCE AS AN ENFORCEMENT ATTORNEY IT IS VERY MUCH THE CASE. THAT IT IS AND IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE FOR A COMPANY TO ENGAGE IN. ACTS AND PRACTICES THAT ARE INDIVIDUALLY. NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW BUT WHEN YOU WHEN YOU STITCH IT ALL TOGETHER THE PROBLEM IS THE PROBLEM MAY BE THAT YOU HAVE- YOU HAVE. A COLLECTION OF. ACTS AND PRACTICES THAT HARM CONSUMERS AND SO THE TOUCHSTONE I WOULD I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THE TOUCHSTONE WITH RESPECT UNFAIR ACTS AND PRACTICES. IS HOW WELL IS A IS A COMPANY PAYING ATTENTION TO ITS CONSUMERS ARE THEY PAYING ATTENTION TO WHETHER THEIR CONSUMERS ARE BEING HARMED. THE BEST IN BREED COMPANIES I'M CONVINCED VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE VOICE OF THE CUSTOMER AND THEY DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF REMEDIATING CONSUMERS AS THEY COME UP. BUT IT THE ACTORS. DON'T DO A GREAT JOB OF DOING THAT. IS THE DBA AND WILL THIS NEW. ENTITY WHATEVER WE CALL IT. BE EXEMPT FROM CO WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT NOW. DO YOU ANTICIPATE HAVING PROMULGATING AS THE AS THE AGENCY OR OR GOVERNMENT ENTITY HEAD ENFORCEMENT POLICIES. WE HAVE I MEAN THE DEPARTMENT AS AS WE STAND TODAY WE ALREADY HAVE AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. IS SET SET OUT IN REGULATION. I WOULD ASSUME SO SENATOR BUT I AM HAPPY TO- I'M HAPPY TO REVISIT WITH GREATER SPECIFICITY ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT THE- SPECTER OF HAVING SOMEBODY ACCUSED THIS NEW ENTITY OF ADOPTING UNDERGROUND REGULATIONS WITHOUT COMPLIANCE WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT IF WE WERE TO PASS THIS TRAILER BILL AND- AUTHORIZE YOU TO. NOT ISSUE REGULATIONS HAVING TO DO WITH YOUR ENFORCEMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES. SENATOR THE SCOPE JUST TO CLARIFY THE AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT UNFAIR DECEPTIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES WOULD BE ROUTED- OUGHT TO BE ROUTED- IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND THEN LEGISLATION AND SO IN THAT REGARD I'M NOT SURE THAT WE ARE OF COURSE EVER MINDFUL OF THE SPECTER OF UNDERGROUND REGULATION- BITES. THAT IS THAT IS OF COURSE- OF A PROCESS THAT WE THAT WE UNDERTAKEN AVOID TODAY WELL HAVING DONE SOME PRACTICE IN CALIFORNIA WITH. BUSINESSES IN FRONT OF AGENCIES ACT I CAN ASSURE YOU THE MOST BUSINESSES WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE. AND I THINK MOST OF THEM IF THEY KNOW THE RULES OF COMPLY BUT IF THE RULES ARE SOMEHOW NOT SET OUT AND REYES. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE STATUTE CAN'T COVER. MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE VARIOUS- ITERATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ENFORCED IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION FOR A BUSINESS. AND BECOME SORT OF A GOTCHA SITUATION SO YOU MAY WANT TO YOU MAY WANT TO REEVALUATE THAT PARTICULAR PROVISION OF THE TROUBLE ONE FINAL QUESTION MADAM CHAIR THE LEGAL ENFORCEMENT DIVISION I COULD NOT TELL FROM THE TRAILER BILL AND DID NOT. HAVE TIME HAVE THE B. C. P. HOW MANY. ATTORNEYS WILL BE ADDED TO THAT DIVISION WELL THAT TO THAT DIVISION I GUESS IS MY QUESTION. SIXTEEN AT SIXTEEN F. T. E.'S INTO ENFORCEMENT WHICH ARE NOT ALL NECESSARILY ATTORNEYS- SOME OF THAT NUMBER OF MAY- MAY COMPRISE INVESTIGATORS AND- NON INTEREST. AS WELL AS- INTERNATIONAL POSITIONS WITHIN THE LEGAL DIVISION- WITHIN THE LEGAL DIVISION SO ENFORCEMENT AND LEGAL OUR ARE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT. DIVISIONS WELL LISTEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR PUTTING UP WITH MY QUESTIONS YOUR RESPONSES WERE. A VERY PROFESSIONAL AND- INAPPROPRIATE AND I DO APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SENATOR NIELSEN FOLLOWED BY SENATORS WHITE HOUSE SKI MORLOCK AND THEY'RE ALSO. A COMMISSIONER ALVAREZ. FIRST OF ALL AS A MATTER PROCESS. THIS IS AN ABUSIVE NOT A CORRECTION A CORRUPTION. ABOUT PROCESS. A TRAILER BILL IS NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE PROVISIONS OF THE BUDGET THIS GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT THIS IS A BRAND NEW COMPLETE IDEA. A BRAND NEW ENTITY. AND YOU'RE GOING TO CIRCUMVENT THE MORE IN DEPTH REVIEW OF A PROCESS BY THIS END RUN. AND RUN AT THE END OF SESSION WITH ONLY A FEW DAYS LEFT TO GO. THE PUBLIC GOT TO BE VERY ALARMED ABOUT THAT SIR NOW THAT'S JUST TO A GENERAL PRACTICING REMARK AND THAT'S ENOUGH FOR ME TO VOTE NO. IN ITSELF. BUT THE LACK OF SPECIFICITY HERE MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE IS EXPLORED IN GREAT DEPTH. BUT WE FELT IT IT'S A NEBULOUS PROPOSAL IS WHAT I WOULD CALL IT AT THIS POINT. THAT WE'RE GOING TO REGULATE QUOTE ANY COVERED PERSON WHAT THE HECK IS A COVERED PERSON IS THERE ANY DOCUMENT THAT DEFINES WHAT A COVERED PERSON IS. YOU USE THE WORD YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'VE DECIDED AND YOU HAVE A PLAN THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT YOUR DEVELOPING A PROCESS. ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY WHAT IS THE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY IS A STATUTE GOING TO BE THE CITATION OF AUTHORITY WHEN THEIR LAWSUITS. IF IT IS IT'S GOING TO BE A VERY WEAK. BASIS AND I READ READ THIS AS PURPOSE SIMPLY PURPOSEFULLY TRYING TO EXEMPT THE AGENCY. FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT SO YOU CAN RUN AND FUNCTION ON UNDERGROUND REGULATION TO DO WHATEVER YOU WANT **** NILLY WE DARE NOT LET THAT CANCER. IN FACT OUR BODIES OF LAW HERE. AND YOU HAVE NOT GIVEN US ANY REAL EVIDENCE OF SOMETHING THAT IS SO BROKEN. THAT REQUIRES SUCH A DRASTIC GROWTH OF A NEW AGENCY. N. AS I ASSESS THE NUMBERS HERE WE'RE OVER A HUNDRED P. WISE JUST TO START THIS. SHIPPED IN THE CHANNEL. AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANY INDICATION OF GREGIS VIOLATIONS. THAT THIS IS SUPPOSED TO FIX. AND WHATNOT DIGIT QUOTE MILESTONES NEED TO BE CODIFIED. SO WE THE LEGISLATURE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOUR PLANT IS. SUFFICE TO SAY THE- PRACTICING REMARKS ARE JUST. A SCATTERING OF CONCERNS. BUT THERE ARE SERIOUS SERIOUS CONCERNS COMMISSIONER ALVAREZ. CAN YOU PUT ME AT EASE ABOUT ANY OF THESE OBSERVATIONS. THAT I OR MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MADE. SENATOR. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS RISK. WE NOW WITH THAT ECONOMIC- DOWNTURNS AND DISLOCATIONS LEAD TO BAD BEHAVIOR IN THE IN THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL- MARKETPLACE- IT WAS AN OBSERVABLE PHENOMENA AND- AND I THINK WE ARE JUST NOW STARTING TO SEE THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG BY. THE INCREASED VOLUME OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS- AND SO I AND I UNDERSTAND- I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE LACK OF GRANULARITY AROUND FOR EXAMPLE- THE 40% SPIKE IN CONSUMER COMPLAINTS BUT I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THE- SURGE IN VOLUME- WITHIN THIS FIRST QUARTER ESSENTIALLY OF THE CODE AND DEMOCRATS- IS ITSELF. ILLUSTRATIVE IN TELLING- DENSO SENATOR WHAT WHAT I WOULD SAY IN THIS REGARD IS THAT WE HAVE I BELIEVE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT HOW DOES- WHAT WHAT IS POTENTIALLY- A VERY SEVERE AND DISASTROUS. ECONOMIC DISLOCATION FOR- FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS- AND I THINK WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO- TO CHECK IN IN RE VISIT- PROGRESS INCREMENTAL STEPS. IF I'M WRONG ABOUT THAT PREDICTION I BELIEVE ME I'M HAPPY TO BE WRONG- BUT I DON'T I AM WORRIED I WOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT FAILING TO ACT SWIFTLY ENOUGH AND- HAVING TO DEAL WITH A LONG TAIL PROBLEM. INTO THE FUTURE- WHEN WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TAX INNER. LET HIM SHOW JUST A COUPLE MORE WORDS. IF I MAY. FAMOUS WORDS OF GOVERNMENT. TO CITIZENS WE NOW. WE GOVERNMENT NO. WHAT'S BEST. AND THESE ARE CHALLENGING ECONOMIC TIMES. CALIFORNIA HAS A BIG ENOUGH PROBLEM. THE NEGATIVE IMAGE TO ATTRACT BUSINESS TO THE STATE. HERE'S ANOTHER NAIL IN THE COFFIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU THIRTY MIL SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY YOU COMMENTED ON ONE HUNDRED F. T. E.'S I JUST WANTED TO RESTATE THE CORRECT IN THE AGENDA. THAT BY THE END OF TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE THE ANTICIPATE. NINETY F. TEASERS WHEN TO MAKE SURE. THANK YOU FOR THAT CORRECTION THANK YOU CENTER BY CAL SKI. MISTER PETERS I APPRECIATE THE INFO COMMERCIAL LINE SB NINE OH EIGHT FOR COMMISSIONER ALVAREZ AND MISS HARPER ST I'M- LET'S PRETEND WE BOTH ARE LUCKY THAT. SB NINE AWAIT BECOMES LAW SO THAT MEANS IN JANUARY ONE ALL DEBT COLLECTORS WILL HAVE TO HAVE TO BE LICENSED IN THIS TRAILER BILL BECOMES LAW IMMEDIATELY LIKE SEPTEMBER FIRST. AND YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE NEWLY COVER PERSONS WHICH WOULD NEED HAVE TO BE REGISTERED. HOW DO YOU ANTICIPATE BEING THE HARMONIZATION AND- OF THOSE TWO ACTIVITIES N. WOULD WE WANT TO HAVE. DEBT COLLECTORS REGISTER WHEN WE KNOW THAT THERE TO GET A LICENSE COME JANUARY FIRST. THANK YOU SENATOR- I SHOULD I SHOULD NOTE AT THE OUTSET THAT- THE DEPARTMENT- DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A POSITION ON SB NINE AWAITS- BUT I CAN SAY- THAT. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL- WAS STRUCTURED WAS WAS INTENT WAS STRUCTURED AND IS INTENDED TO ACCOMPANY. LEGISLATIVE LICENSURE BILLS AND SO WE CERTAINLY ENVISIONED PROVIDING- THE LEGISLATURE- ANY ANY DATA AND INFORMATION THAT MIGHT NEED TO. NOT TOO BAD TO BATH INFORM POLICY AND LICENSING STRUCTURES. ARE ON. OUR INTENTION IS THAT LICENSING STRUCTURES AND THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL- WORK WORK IN HARMONY- IT IS- I WOULD ALSO BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T NOTICE- AS AS IS. EXISTING ON THE REGISTRATION STRUCTURE OF COURSES IS SIMPLY THAT AND THE LICENSING STRUCTURE- DEPENDING ON HOW IT IS- HOW IS ARCHITECTED- MAY. MAY EQUIRE- CHOIR SUPERVISORY ACTIVITY WITHIN A PRESCRIBED PERIOD OF TIME WHICH IS WHICH IS ALL WELL AND GOOD THAT IS OF COURSE A- A CORE FUNCTION OF OUR OF THE CURRENT DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT- I WOULD SIMPLY NOTE THAT THE- THE INVESTMENT REQUIRED. TO ENSURE THAT- THE LICENSING EXAMINATION CYCLE CAN BE COMPLETED WITHIN A PRESCRIBED PERIOD OF TIME- IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHER THAN- THAN FOR INSTANCE A REGISTRATION SCHEME AT THE OUTSET. RECORD WOULDN'T YOU AGREE THAT SOMEBODY BEFORE TRYING TO STOP ABUSIVE UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE ACTIVITY AND IF YOU HAVE A LICENSE IN ORDER JUST TO DO BUSINESS IN THE STATE. YOU WERE MORE LIKELY NOT OR YOU WOULD YOU WOULD LOSE YOUR LICENSE IF YOU DIDN'T DO THAT IF YOU'RE AN UNREGULATED ENTITY YOU MAY JUST GET. FINED OR HAVE TO GIVE A CONSUMER BACK THEIR MONEY BUT YOU YOU CAN IF YOU'RE AN LICENSE YOU CAN CONTINUE TAX. RUN YOUR BUSINESS VERSUS A LICENSE PERSON THIS IS DONE AM I CORRECT IN THAT DO YOU DIRECT. THANK YOU SENATOR WHAT WHAT I WOULD SAY I WOULD I WOULD SAY AS A GENERAL MATTER AGAIN DEPENDING ON HOW A LICENSING SCHEME IS ARCHITECTED A LICENSING SCHEME MAY VERY WELL BE- MORE- ME VERY WELL- ALLOW FOR MORE PUNITIVE- RESPONSES TO BAD BEHAVIOR WITHIN WITHIN A GIVEN INDUSTRY OR SECTOR. I'M NOT I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE'S IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S THREE GROUPS OF PEOPLE THERE'S THESE NEWLY COVERED PERSONS. AND CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT- THE DPO IS GOING TO DECIDE IF THERE. IS SOME OF THESE NEWLY COVER PERSON HAS TO BE REGISTERED AND THEN THERE'S THIS CLASS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LICENSE LICENSES IS THAT. IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THE THREE SORT OF GROUPS OF FOLKS THAT WERE DOING THAT MAY BE INVOLVED IN THE PEACE OF. UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE ACTS. I APOLOGIZE SENATOR I TRACKED- I TRACK WOULD YOU MIND RESTATING BECAUSE I TRACK TO TWO CLASSES. WE HAVE NEWLY COVERED PERSONS WHO COULD BE YOU DID YOU DECIDE OF THAT NEWLY COVER PERSON BECOMES A REGISTRANT OR NOT. BY TO YOU COULD YOU COULD HAVE A EWLY COVER PERSON THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO REGISTER. ARE YOU ANTICIPATING EVERYBODY ANY ANY DEEMED NEARLY COVER PERSON YOU'RE GOING TO REGISTER A MALL. WE ANTICIPATE SO WE WOULD ANTICIPATE GOING THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS TO ARTICULATE- TO. ESSENTIALLY DEFINE THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF A OF A NEARLY COVERED PERSON POPULATION. OKAY ALL RIGHT- SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S SOME LICENSEES NOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE LICENSE BETTER TO BE EXAM FROM. THIS ACTION TO. THEY HAVE THE STATE IN THE FEDERAL LAWS REGARDING THIS ABUSIVE DECEPTIVE ACTIVITY AND THEN BE EXEMPT FROM PAYING. A CONSUMER BACK TO REFUND. WHICH IS INVOLVING INACTION OF THEIR LICENSE AND HAVING THEM EXAM FROM YOU KNOW HAVING TO GIVE UP TO SUIT SORT OF BILL GOTTEN GAINS- THAT CONCERNS ME THAT CONCERNS ME SO WHAT WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT IS A LOOK WE'RE GETTING. A LITTLE CONFUSION WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT THAT YOU WOULD BE DOING AND WHETHER YOU'RE GONNA GO TO SUPERIOR COURT AND TRY TO GET THE CONSUMER BACK TO REFUND AT MY UNDERSTANDING OF DODD DODD FRANK IS THAT WE WANT TO HAVE THESE THINGS DONE ADMINISTRATIVELY AND NOT HAVE TO GO INTO COURT EVERY DAY- TO RECEIVE THAT WHAT DO YOU HOLD A LICENSE OR WHETHER YOU'RE REGISTERING. IS THAT HOW YOU SEE THE PROGRAM GOING. THANK SENATOR DODD ET SO DODD FRANK DOES IN MY VIEW CONTEMPLATES- PURSUING APPROPRIATE- APPROPRIATE PENALTIES AND REMEDIES. IN EITHER- THE CIVIL CIVIL COURT ACTION- WAR ADMINISTRATIVELY- USE- IT HIGHLIGHTED A- PARTICULAR SET OF CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED WHICH IS WHICH IS WHICH IS TO SAY WHETHER- WHETHER DODD FRANK IN FACT SUPPLANTS. EXISTING ADMINISTRATIVE- FRAMEWORKS AND THAT IS A CONVERSATION THAT THAT I- THE CONVERSATION OR ONE OF THE FINAL CONVERSATIONS WE'VE BEEN HAVING- WITH SOME OF OUR- WITH SOME OF OUR EXISTING LICENSEES AND WHAT I WOULD SAY AGAIN IS WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE STRIVING FOR IS. A MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD- SO THAT THERE IS- A UNIFORM SET OF MINIMUM CONSUMER PROTECTIONS- TO WHICH WE CAN HOLD ACTORS ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THEM THE EXISTING LICENSEES WANT TO FORCE YOU TO TAKE HIM INTO COURT RATHER THAN HAVE AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING UNDER. THEIR LCENSE AND DODD FRANK IN ORDER TO RESOLVE THE ABUSIVE UNFAIR AND DECEPTIVE ACTS THAT THEY'VE ENGAGED IN. I THAT HAS BEEN MY UNDERSTANDING AGAIN IS THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE- PERSPECTIVE. OFFERED UP BY AT LEAST SONG ARE INCUMBENT LICENSEES. THANK YOU SENATOR Y. CASKEY SENATOR MORE LOCK WILL BE FOLLOWED BY US INTO THEIR ALSO MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU COMMISSIONER ALVAREZ HI. I WISH THAT. ERECTOR OF THE DMV WOULD HAVE CONTACTED US EARLY ON AND SAID I NEED MORE STAFFING BECAUSE WE SEE. A GROWTH IN DEMAND BECAUSE OF REAL ID SOUGHT BY A FIRM YOU AND. YOUR CONCERN ABOUT WHAT MAY BE AN INCREASE IN CERTAIN FINANCIAL SHENANIGANS OR OR- WHATEVER WE WANNA WE WANNA CALL A FINANCIAL ABUSE SO WITH THAT I IDEA. EVER ALREADY COVERED YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO FIX AND WHY IT NEEDS A NEW NAME AND WHY IT NEEDS A 15% INCREASE IN STAFFING WE REDISCOVERED THE DISCUSS THE YOU DON'T HAVE A WRITTEN BUSINESS PLAN. AND IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THIS IS A FALLS UNDER G. R. P. WHICH WE DISCUSSED EARLIER THIS MORNING GOVERNOR'S A REORGANIZATION PROPOSAL BUT WHAT I AM I HAVEN'T. SEEN ASKED YET IS WHY ARE WE- UNDER THE IMPRESSION THE ATTORNEY. IS FAILING- OR FALLING SHORT- TO REQUIRE THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU SENATOR YOU KNOW TO BE CLEAR I WOULD- I WOULD SAY THAT. IN THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB OF PROSECUTING INVESTIGATING AND PROSECUTING. MEANINGFUL CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION ACTIONS. WEBER OVER THE LAST DECADE AND LONGER- THEIR CONSUMER LAW SECTION OF COURSE HAS A LONG HISTORY OF BRINGING MEANINGFUL ACTION AND REDRESS THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. BUT IT'S I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO- TO REALIZE THAT THE AG'S CONSUMER LAW SECTION IS BUT ONE SECTION- WHOSE MANDATE IS ARE QUITE BROAD IS BROADER THAN SIMPLY CONSERVE OUR FINANCIAL PROTECTION- AND IN OUR CONVERSATION WITH THEM I THINK IT IS. FAIR TO SAY THAT THEY- THEY BELIEVE THAT ADDITIONAL HELP- WOULD BE WOULD BE WARRANTED AND APPROPRIATE AND SO I DON'T. YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW. THAT WE SEE THIS AS SUPPLANTING YOUR SERVICE ANY OF THE GOOD WORK THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE HAS HAS DONE THIS THERE IS SIMPLY- REAL PRACTICAL RECOGNITION THAT THERE IS VALUE. TO HAVING- A DEDICATED CONSUMER FINANCIAL- AGENCY AT THE STATE LEVEL- THAT CAN GO A LITTLE MORE BROADLY- DOWN THAT CAN CURRENTLY BE COVERED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THE OTHER THING. I WOULD OFFER UP IS THE FOLLOWING. WHEN DOT WAS WHEN THAT THOUSAND DOLLARS ACT WAS PASSED. AGAIN IT IT IN. A PROVISION THAT ESSENTIALLY AUTHORIZES EVERY ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THE COUNTRY. TO USE THE TOOLS WITHIN DODD FRANK THE TOOLS IN THE REMEDIES- ARTICULATED IN DODD FRANK AGAINST- AGAINST BAD ACTORS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES THAT WAS. TEN YEARS AGO AND- AGAIN WELL I AM UNABLE TO PRESENTS- GRANULAR STATISTICS I THINK- I THINK WE WILL I WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO CONCLUDE THAT- THAT WE HAVE SEEN. A RATIFICATION OF BAD BEHAVIOR AND THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL- SERVICES SPACE OVER THE LAST DECADE. SO THIS MORNING I ASKED THE QUESTION MAY BE ASKED TO HAVE YOU AS WELL SORT OF FEELS MY GUESS WE USE THE TERM SEAT WHAT'S THE SEED OF THE IDEA. OF EXPANDING YOUR DEPARTMENT CHANGING. WHAT IT DOES WHAT IS JURISDICTION IS- WAS IT A LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION REPORT AND ELLIE A REPORT A STATE AUDITOR REPORT. OR IS IT JUST BECAUSE OF SOME CONCERN ABOUT DODD FRANK. THANK YOU SENATOR I WOULD SAY THAT CONCERNS ABOUT DODD FRANK WERE- AS FACTOR BUT CERTAINLY NOT THE SINGLE FACTOR- I THINK THE UNDERLYING MOTIVATION REALLY HAD MORE TO DO WITH WITH THE FOLLOWING TWO QUESTIONS NUMBER ONE- HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA- ROMANES- REMAINS EIGHT A LEADER IN THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION SPACE AND AGAIN THIS. THIS THAT BACK QUESTION PREDATES THE CURRENT CODE PANDEMIC- BUT I THINK THERE'S A- THERE IS A REAL IMPRACTICAL RECOGNITION THAT AGAIN CALIFORNIA HAS A WORLD CLASS ECONOMY- AND IT. IT IS DESERVING OF A I THE WORLD CLASS. DEPARTMENT AGAIN ONE WITH ROBUST TOOLS ROBUST AND DIVERSE TOOLS INCLUDING SOME OF THESE MARKET MONITORING FUNCTION THAT CAN HELP- THAT CAN HELP BETTER INFORM POLICYMAKING BUT ALSO THEY CAN FRANKLY HELP- MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANTS BETTER UNDERSTAND- THE MACRO THE MACROECONOMIC FIELD- AND THEN SECONDLY YOU KNOW THE QUESTION IS THAT THE SECOND QUESTION- THAT THIS PROPOSAL SEEKS THAT THE BALANCE HOW IT IS. AND WE ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA REMAINS A LEADER IN INNOVATION WITH RESPECT TO CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND THERE AGAIN THERE IS A PRACTICAL RECOGNITION OF THE ACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS- DANIEL LEADER IN INNOVATION OVER THE LAST DECADE AT LEAST ARE GOING BACK TO YOU KNOW- HOW WE INTERACT WITH THE MOVEMENT OF MONEY- WITH THE RISE OF COMPANIES LIKE. HOW AND SQUARE IN STRIPE. THIS IS THAT YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THERE IS A TREND THERE THAT IS IRREVERSIBLE AND SO IT IS IN MY VIEW JUST AS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE RETOOL OUR CAPABILITIES THE STATE LEVEL. SO THAT WE CAN. APPROPRIATELY NAMED BILLY- SO THAT'S- I SAW THAT BACK KIND OF INNOVATION CAN CONTINUE TO THRIVE AND TAKE PLACE IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER. COMMISSIONER ELVIS THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR VISION- I'M ALSO I JUST WANNA SHARE OF INCLUDE INCLUSION WHAT I'M SEEING AND- JUST RECENTLY CHARLES SCHWAB- MERGED WITH TD AMERITRADE IT WAS A TWENTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS ALL STOCK DEAL. SCHWAB IS HEADQUARTERED IN CALIFORNIA AMERITRADE WAS HEADQUARTERED NEBRASKA. AND AFTER THE MERGER THE NEW HEADQUARTERS IS IN THE STATE TAXES SO I'M I'M NERVOUS ABOUT. WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE WE'RE SENDING TO FINANCIAL PROVIDERS- IN A LOT OF AREAS- SO I HAVE SOME MISGIVINGS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. YOU COULD TAKE YOUR EXISTING DEPARTMENT AT THE STAFF AND THEN IMAGES PROPOSED THE LEGISLATIVE FIXES YOU WANT AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL DEFINE WHAT A SERVICE PROVIDER IS IT WHAT A MATERIAL SERVICES AND WE HAVE A CHANCE TO BET THOSE AND SO I THINK YOU. COMMISSIONER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU THIRTY DORADO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I VERY MUCH BELIEVE IN STRENGTHENING AND PROTECTING CONSUMER RIGHTS. ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO A LOW PAID ALL WORKERS OF FAMILIES ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. I'D LIKE TO THINK I'VE VOTED FOR EVERYTHING THAT IN ANY WAY STRENGTHENS STRENGTHENS. ON THEIR RIGHT TO BE TREATED FAIRLY NOT TO BE SCARED. AND FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW THAT SAYS WE DON'T NEED TO DO ANYTHING MORE. BUT I'M COMING FROM THE POINT OF VIEW THAT. WE ARE FACING RIGHT NOW. AND WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT IT AND LEGAL HOME AND TO OUR DISTRICTS AND WE TALKED TO OUR CONSTITUENTS THEY ARE FACING LIFE AND DEATH. LIFE AND DEATH. ALL I HEAR ABOUT WHICH IS ABSOLUTELY WHAT THEY SHOULD BE TELLING ME IS WHAT'S GOING ON IN THEIR LIVES HOW AT WORK THEY'RE AFRAID TO GO TO WORK BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA GET CONTAGIOUS. AT THE SAME TIME IF THEY DON'T GO TO WORK THEY DON'T HAVE. THE MONEY. TO BUY FOOD FOR OUR PAY THE RENT. WE HAVE IN SPITE OF AN EVICTION MORATORIUM WE HAVE. IN JUST FORTY FOUR COUNTY SIXTEEN HUNDRED EVICTIONS IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND THAT'S NOT COUNTING L. A. COUNTY. AND THE FOURTEEN OTHER COUNTIES WE HAVE AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS A WEEK AND WAGE THEFT. THE SIX MILLION DOLLARS JUST IN L. A. COUNTY WAGE THEFT. SO IF SOMEBODY TRIES TO SAY THAT WE'RE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT. PEOPLE OF COLOR AND BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. I DON'T DOUBT YOUR CONCERN BUT I DOUBT THAT WE'RE GIVING THE KIND OF. SPECIAL FOCUS THAT NEEDS TO BE-GIVEN TO THESE VERY CRITICAL AND URGENT MATTERS. WILLIAM WE WANT TO PROTECT THE WORLD CLASS ECONOMY I THINK THE WHAT BEST WHERE DEFENDING THAT REPUTATION IS BY. REALLY TAKING CARE OF EVERYBODY WHO WORKS FOR THIS ECONOMY. AND I SAY ALL OF THAT YOU MIGHT THINK IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS ISSUE. I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS. ABOUT MOVING FORWARD WITH THE PROPOSAL LIKE THIS THAT IS SO URGENT. AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IS IT THAT. LEAD YOU ALL THE MEASURE THE URGENCY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS ADD STAFF IN THE DEPARTMENT- THE INCREASE THE FUNDING FOR THAT DEPARTMENT WHEN. THE REST OF THE WORLD IS THINKING ABOUT HOW MY GONNA LIVE HOW MY GONNA SURVIVE. WHAT ABOUT PAYING THE RENT SCARED TO DEATH ABOUT GETTING THE BIG THAT LIKE THEY SEE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE DOING I HAVE YET TO HEAR FROM YOU. A REALLY COMPELLING CASE TO SHOW THE URGENCY OF DOING THIS NOW. YES NOBODY WANTS TO NOBODY WANTS TO ANSWER WHO WOULD WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO DIRECTED TO SENATOR THE COMMISSIONER OF FINANCE. OF THE COMMISSION AND FINANCE. COMMISSIONER. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. I OF COURSE- CANNOT DISPUTE ANY OF THE- MANY OF THE- OUR CONCERN THAT YOU ARTICULATE. AND I THINK IT IS VERY MUCH D. CONCERNED THAT YOUR TO KELLY THAT- THAT ANIMATES- THE URGENCY OF THIS PROPOSAL. THE CONCERN OF COURSE IS THAT AS- AS PEOPLE ARE. AS PEOPLE ARE DRIVEN TO ITS FINANCIAL BRINK THEY- ARE THEY BECOME MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO. FINANCIAL PREDATION- AND THAT'S A SITUATION THAT WE'RE STRIVING TO AVOID. AND I THINK THAT THAT GOES HAND IN HAND WITH. WITH SOME OF WITH WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF. ENSURING THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GET THROUGH- THE CURRENT PANDEMIC IN CRISIS- AS BEST POSSIBLE. WITHOUT WITHOUT HITTING OR RESORTING TO. OTHER SOCIAL SERVICE THAT'S- SO I WOULD. YOU KNOW I WOULD I WOULD. I WOULD OFFER THAT THE PROPOSAL'S VERY MUCH ANIMATED BY- THAT CONCERN THAT- PEOPLE AND- IN THE MOST VULNERABLE THE MOST VULNERABLE POSITIONS TODAY WILL REMAIN THE MOST VULNERABLE POSITIONS OF TOMORROW AND- WILL REMAIN THOSE THAT ARE MOST SUBJECT TO FINANCIAL PREDATION WHICH WE ARE TRYING TO PROTECT AGAINST. THANK YOU CENTER DRAWS ONLY MOVE ONTO CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU ON. FOR THE COMMISSION I BELIEVE THIS THIS QUESTION HAS BEEN. ADDRESS SPREAD I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY SO THAT WE- THAT THE DODD FRANK ACT IN EFFECT INVITED STATES TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS SUCH AS WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE AND TO EMPOWER THEIR FINANCIAL REGULATORS. TO PROHIBITS. THE LICENSEES FROM ENGAGING IN VARIOUS PRACTICES AND THAT TOO IN ORDER TO- PURSUE RESTITUTION OR WHATEVER TO BE ABLE TO DO IT WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO COURT SO I THINK THAT IS BEEN. BUT WHATEVER THE QUESTIONS ARE SO FAR ASKED IS PRETTY MUCH. ASCERTAINED THAT IT MIGHT CORRECT. I BELIEVE YOU'RE CORRECT SENATOR- THE PROVISION- I THINK THE PRINT THE MATERIAL PROVISION IN DODD FRANK PROVIDES THE STATE REGULATOR MAY BRING A CIVIL ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING SO THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE SO YET MEANING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DIDN'T ACT YET WE I MEAN YES CERTAINLY IT'S LOOK WE COULD ALLEGEDLY. DISCUSSED WHETHER WE FEEL IT'S- RIGHT THIS CURRENT MOMENT IS THE TIME TO DO SO BUT- THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T YET ISN'T A MATTER OF THAT IT IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE ACTION TO DO. N. A. I'M A WELL I SHARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT CREATING NEW POSITIONS RIGHT NOW IN THIS TIME OF- ECONOMIC DOWNTURN I'M ALSO QUITE AWARE- IN MY OWN PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WE JUST DEALT WITH THE SOME INCREASED- PENALTIES FOR I'M GONNA BLOW IT THE- OF PRICE GOUGING THE SO. THROUGH BASICALLY IN MY OWN PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT WERE BROUGHT FORWARD BECAUSE OF EGREGIOUS PRACTICES THE VARIOUS ENTITIES HAVE BEEN ENGAGING IN NOW TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE EITHER THEY'RE EXPERIENCING ECONOMICALLY OR DO DISCOVERED CRISIS SO IN THAT RESPECT. IT I FEEL THE ONE COULD MAKE A STRONG ARGUMENT THAT WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED HERE IS NEEDED NOW BECAUSE OUR CONSUMERS ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE AND ALSO FACING PARTICULAR- HARDSHIPS- D. THE MAIN QUESTION I THINK WAS REALLY BEEN ADDRESSED BECAUSE OF THEOTHER ONE I WAS GOING TO ASK IS- JUST THAT CONFORMITY WITH DODD FRANK BUT I THINK ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE ADDRESSED THAT- AND YOU HAVE JUST REINFORCE THAT IT'S THAT IT IS OUR RIGHT. SO I FEEL LIKE THE ADMINISTRATION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT THE FEDERAL LAW ALLOWS US TO DO HAS TAKEN THE RIGHT APPROACH THEN I ALSO FEEL THAT RIGHT NOW WE ARE SEEING THAT- OUR CURRENT BREAKS DO YOU HAVE GAPS THAT HAVE LEFT THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS SERVICES AND COMPANIES OUTSIDE OF OUR DEPARTMENT SECURITY AND THAT THIS DOES BUILD ON THE MODEL THAT THE FEDERAL CONSUMER PROTECTION BUREAU WAS ESTABLISHED FOR HOWEVER UNFORTUNATELY THE FEDERAL THE FEDS HAVE GUTTED THAT SO THAT IS ANOTHER ARGUMENT I THINK FOR NOW IF THE- IF THE TERM PROTECTION BOROUGH FEDERALLY WAS WAS OPERATING AS IT WAS INTENDED IN FIRST ESTABLISHED. PERHAPS THAT WE NEED TO ACT RIGHT NOW BUT I THINK THAT BECAUSE WERE NOT BEING PROVIDED THOSE SAFEGUARDS AND BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT OUR CONSUMERS ARE UNDER A LOT OF ODD DID JUDE- PRESSURE ALL GUESTS FOR LACK OF BETTER WORD THAT IT THIS SEEMS TO ME TO BE AN APPROPRIATE PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW AS DIFFICULT AS OUR. FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THANK YOU SENATORS CARE I'LL JUST NOTE THAT SO OF THE QUESTIONS MEMBERS REYES OF. COULD ALSO POSSIBLY BE ANSWERED BY OUR PANEL THAT WILL COME NEXT I WANT TO ENCOURAGE PALACE THAT IF YOU'RE HEARING QUESTIONS YOU'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE FEEL FREE TO INCORPORATE THAT INTO YOUR PRESENTATION- SENATOR PAN AND THAT. SORT OF THE COMING YEAR- WILL BE- OUR LAST MEMBER BEFORE WE MOVE TO THE PANEL SENATOR FAN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- I APPRECIATE I WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE PANEL BUT THEN- SIR KASKI HAS HAD SOME QUESTIONS I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON. AND CERTAINLY CEDIT IS SOMETHING THAT- ESPECIALLY DURING THIS CRISIS- THIS PANDEMIC WHICH IS LEADING TO A FINANCIAL CRISIS THAT I KNOW THAT BUSINESSES I MEAN DOWN THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. IT COUNTING ON AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS TO TRY TO GET THROUGH THIS FINANCIAL CRISIS CERATOPSIANS TO BACK OUT HE SAID TALKED ABOUT THE THREE CLASSES RIGHT AND SO WE HAVE THE PEOPLE LICENSE WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE. AND THEN YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SENSUALLY THESE COVERED PERSONS. SOME OF WHOM WILL BE ASKED TO REGISTER AND I WASN'T CLEAR FROM THE COMMISSIONER WHETHER THEY WERE GONNA BE QUOTE COVERED PERSONS WHO WEREN'T AND EXACTLY WHO'S A COVERED PERSON SO. I COULD COULD THERE BE A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF IT IS THE INTENTION OF THE ADMINISTRATION ISN'T IT AND THIS TRAILER BILL THAT ANYONE WHO ENGAGES IN ANY FORM NO MATTER HOW LARGE OR SMALL OR WHATEVER OF. IT WOULD WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REGISTER- IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY ORDER ACTUALLY THERE IS A- SCALE OR SOME POINT NOW SOME GROUP THAT IS THAT THIS COULD BE US TO REGISTER ANOTHER GROUP WHO PERHAPS BECAUSE- ARE NOT. CONTENT IT IS AS THAT AND FIGURED OUT IS THAT GOING TO BE DEALT LATER IS THAT SOMETHING CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT NOW. THANK YOU CENTERS SO THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE- PROPOSAL'S SEEMS THAT THE. THAT THAT COVERED PERSONS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REGISTER BUT IN ORDER TO DETERMINE- SO EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO MIGHT FALL UNDER THAT DEFINITION WOULD HAVE TO REGISTER. RIGHT SO AS PART OF THE REGULATORY PROCESS IN OKAY AND WORKS AND I UNDERSTAND THE DEFINITION OF A COVERED PERSONS ANYONE WHO ENGAGES IN ANY COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL ACTIVITY NO MATTER HOW SMALL. IS THAT TRUE. NO SMELL IN REGISTERING AND SUPERVISING YOU COVERED PERSONS AS AS PART OF THE PROCESS WE WOULD WEIGH THE STATE'S INTEREST IN OVERSIGHT AGAINST THE RISK OF WORLD OKAY OKAY SO HOW DO I KNOW IF I'M A COVERED PERSON OR NOT. IF YOU HAVEN'T PROMULGATED REGULATIONS YET AS TO WHOSE CAR WHO WHO IS A COVERED PERSON. LET ME JUST AS AN EXAMPLE HI A LOAN MONEY TO MY NEIGHBOR. I MAY EVEN HAVE AN MO YOU BECAUSE MY ACCOUNT AND ASKED ME TO DO THAT THAT'S NOW FINANCIAL TRANSACTION PERHAPS EVEN COMMERCIAL THEY MIGHT NOW COVERED PERSON. HE WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT ENSURE THAT POTENTIAL REGISTRANTS NO THAT KNOW WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED. OKAY BUT YET IN THIS TRAILER BILL YOU ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO HAND FORSMAN POWER BEFORE THOSE REGULATIONS ARE PROMULGATED. WE WOULD HAVE BEEN WE WOULD HAVE THE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY TO PROHIBIT UNFAIR DECEPTIVE. AND ABUSIVE ACTS AND PRACTICES ASKED YOU ASKED THE COVERED PERSONS OKAY ALL RIGHT. SO LET ME GET TO MY POINT HERE BECAUSE OF ONE I DON'T WANT THAT. SO MY CONCERN IS THAT WHILE I CERTAINLY- FIRST OF ALL. I APPRECIATE WHAT SENATOR RAZA SAID ALL RIGHT BECAUSE WE HAVE A PANDEMIC- AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR ANSWERS WELL I MEAN. THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PREDATION. IT'S GOING ON BUT I'M ALSO VERY CONCERNED THAT THAT THIS PROPOSAL HAS NOT BEEN VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT. AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH BAND WITH INDIAN MINISTRATION TO FIGURE THIS ALL OUT GIVEN THE STATE IT'S IN FRONT OF US. IN FACT I WOULD ARGUE. THAT IF PREDATION IS AND I'M NOT DISPUTING THAT THAT COULD BE AN ISSUE THAT PERHAPS THE GOVERNOR OUT CON EXTRAORDINARY SESSION SO WE ACTUALLY OF THE TIME TO WORK THROUGH THIS. FRANKLY YOU KNOW THIS TRYING TO DO THIS IN THE LAST MINUTE WITHOUT THINKING THESE THINGS OUT I JUST PURCHASED A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION AS A FOLLOW UP TO A QUESTION MY COLLEAGUE. YOU REALLY COULDN'T ANSWER CLEARLY. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT AT THE VOTING ON. IF YOU ASK ME TO VOTE ON THIS I THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM SO PERHAPS THE PANEL CAN HELP CLARIFY BUT I ALSO THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A MUCH. CLEARER AND BETTER DEFINED PROPOSAL FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. ESPECIALLY ON THIS MAGNITUDE. I'M NOT DISPUTING THE ISSUE OF THE PROBLEM BEFORE WE SHOULD BE. TO HAVE TO PASS IT I WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE IS. AS AS YOU'VE NOTED BEFORE THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE TO SCOUR UNDER DODD FRANK THAT THE STATE APPARENTLY I'M NOT SAYING THAT MAYBE IT WAS EXPENSIVE ENOUGH BUT- DODD FRANK APPARENTLY. IT WAS NEVER REQUIRES. AT LEAST A STATE NEVER PURSUED IT. SO THAT ALSO AGAIN DEFINES EXACTLY WHAT THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM IS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN AMERICAN TO GO AHEAD AND PROCEED TO OUR PANEL. IF ANY MEMBERS I HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AFTER THE PANEL WILL CERTAINLY- BE ABLE TO ENTERTAIN THEM AS WELL WE'RE GOING TO GET STARTED WITH OUR FIRST PANELISTS. MISTER RICHARD CORDRAY FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. WHO WILL BE FOLLOWED BY MISS STROKE BALA. REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA REINVESTMENT COALITION THEN KEVIN GOULD CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION AND SCOTT GOVERNOR CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THEM TODAY MR CORDRAY. THANK YOU MANAGER UNDERSTANDS THE COMBINED REMARKS FOUR MINUTES IS THAT CORRECT. YES SIR THANK YOU OKAY. IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BEYOND YOUR PREPARED REMARKS ARE IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS YOU ARE HEARD YOU CAN FEEL FREE TO ADD THOSE. THANK YOU. SURE MITCHELL SURE BRADFORD AND SENATORS THIS IS RICHARD CORDRAY FOR SIX YEARS I SERVED AS THE FIRST DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. AND BEFORE THAT AS A HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL. ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS YOU WANT. IT RESPECTFULLY AND WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY INFORMED BY MY EXPERIENCE AS WE WORK THROUGH THE LAST ECONOMIC CRISIS. IS SUPPORTED VIDEO TRAILER BILL TO STRENGTHEN THE STATE FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT. IT WILL PROVIDE YOUR CONSTITUENTS WITHOUT USE OF GENERAL FUND MONIES THE PROTECTION THEY NEED TO PREVENT CREDITORS FROM SWINDLING THEM WHEN THEY CAN LEAST AFFORD IT. THIS MEASURES DESIGNED TO PROTECT CONSUMERS SMALL BUSINESSES NONPROFITS AND FAMILY FARMS AND TO MAKE SURE THERE'S A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL PROVIDERS OF FINANCIAL SERVICES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS WE HAVE HEARD OVER THE PAST YEAR MANY CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES ARE CRYING OUT FOR MORE OVERSIGHT OF UNREGULATED BUSINESSES. CURRENTLY CAN UNDERCUT THEM IN THE MARKET PLACE. INCLUDING THE STATE'S FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT IS AN URGENT MATTER IN THE FACE OF WIDESPREAD AND- DISTRESS METRAGE. DROWSINESS SENATOR SENIOR POINTS. AT ISSUE. CALIFORNIA WAS HIT EXTREMELY HARD BY THE FINANCIAL CRISIS AND GREAT RECESSION TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. COMMUNITIES YOUR COMMUNITIES WERE ROCKED BY FORECLOSURE PEOPLE LOST THEIR HOMES MANY WONDERED HOW. PEOPLE'S LIVES WERE DESTROYED IN CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET WAS UPSIDE DOWN FOR YEARS IT'S WIDESPREAD UNEMPLOYMENT FORECLOSURES. STRAIN THE STATE'S RESOURCE OF. THE SAME KIND OF ECONOMIC CRISIS IS NOW PRESSING DOWN ON CALIFORNIA A. AS WE'RE SEEING TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. FINANCIAL CREDITORS ARE COMING OUT OF THE WOODWORK TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF DESPERATE CONSUME. CONSUMER THANKS ABOUT THEM REACHING RECORD LEVELS NEVER SEEN BEFORE. IF CALIFORNIA FAILS TO ACT IMMEDIATELY WE KNOW MORE PEOPLE LOSE THEIR HOMES AND LIFE SAVINGS. CREDIT AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL WILL BE DESTROYED. MANY WILL NEVER EVER RECOVER. CHIEF KEEF OF THE- IMPACT THE NEW ELSE YOU ASKED ABOUT THE WITH THIS. FIRST IT IS NOT DRAWN ANY GENERAL FUND REVENUES BUT ONLY SPECIAL FUNDS WITHIN DVO CANNOT BE BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THE ECONOMIC CRISIS WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY. SECOND OF PUTS IN PLACE THE MEASURES NEEDED TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA FAMILIES FROM FALLING OFF THE EDGE INTO FINANCIAL RUIN. THOSE FAMILIES WHICH SHOULD NOT HAVE TO RESORT TO STATE SIX SAFE ENOUGH PROGRAMS WILL HAVE NO OTHER CHOICE AND THEIR NEED FOR FURTHER PRESSURING CALIFORNIA'S BUDGETARY RESOURCES. DELAYED ACTION MEANS LONG TERM DAMAGE TO COMMUNITIES THAT ARE UNDER GREAT PRESSURE RIGHT NOW. FURTHER STRAINING THE STATE SOURCES DURING THE MINING EFFORTS TOWARD ECONOMIC RECOVERY. PAST SEVEN MONTHS THERE'S BEEN MUCH AND FORTH AMONG STATE. OF THE TRAILER BILL. THREE POINT STAND OUT. FIRST THERE'S BROADSUPPORT FOR BRINGING I'M LICENSED AND REGISTERED FINANCIAL WRITERS UNDER THE SAME REGULATORY OVERSIGHT IS EXISTING. LICENSEES THESE ARE THE COVERED PERSONS TO FIND IN THE TRAILER BILL YOU'RE ASKED ABOUT SENATOR NELSON. IT'S GROSSLY UNFAIR TO CALIFORNIA'S MANY BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS AND OTHER EXISTING LICENSEES TO HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OF COMPANIES. THAT DON'T HAVE TO MEET THE SAME STANDARD. THIS PROPOSAL PUTS EVERYBODY ON THE SAME LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WHICH IS GOOD FOR CONSUMERS AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES ALIKE. SECOND CALIFORNIA CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT WALK AWAY FROM THIS OPPORTUNITY TO STAND ON ITS OWN TWO FEET. AND MODERNIZE ITS FRAMEWORK FOR PROTECTING CONSUMERS SOME SUGGEST WE SHOULD LEAVE IT TO THE PROGRAM IN WASHINGTON WE SEEM TO SEE IF HE COULD RETREAT DRAMATICALLY WHO HAS RESPONSIBILITY. FOR THIS REASON FEDERAL ON BITES STATES TO TAKE ON MORE OF A ROLE IN OVERSEEING FINANCIAL PROVIDERS AND THE TRAILER BILL EXCEPT THAT IN THE H. S. FOR EXISTING LICENSEES. IN THIS CASE THE QUESTION SENATOR BRADFORD ROTH AND SKINNER TOUCHED ON. THE PROPOSAL UNDER DISCUSSION IS TO LARGELY HOLD THEM HARMLESS AS LONG AS THE APPROPRIATE PROCESSES PUT IN PLACE TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE REFUNDS. CONSUMERS TO HAVE MONEY WRONGLY TAKEN FROM THE- ATHLETE. THIRD THE TRAILER BILL INCLUDES BROAD RANGE OF CONSUMER INSTEAD OF GROUPS AND LOCAL OFFICIALS THIS WHO FEEL THE NEED AND ARE ASKING FOR URGENT BUT IT ALSO AN COALITIONS BUSINESSES WHO HAVE OFTEN BEEN AND MARKET PLACE AND WE'RE SEEKING THE SAME AS CONSUMERS UNDER AFFORDABLE WITH AN EMPHASIS ON CONSUMER FRIENDLY INNOVATIONS THEY'RE DEMANDING ACTION THEY DESERVE SUCH PROTECTION AND WOULD HELP STRENGTHEN CALIFORNIA. PLEAS REASONS BECAUSE IN THE NEW URGENCY TO DISTRESSED FAMILIES OUR FEELINGS ARE BEING HAMMERED IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CRISIS ADOPTION OF THE TRAILER BILL WOULD HELP CALIFORNIA REPORTED NEARLY GET FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES ACTION FIGURES- SURE MITCHELL SURE BRADFORD SENATORS RIGHT NOW MANY SOPHISTICATED BUSINESSES LOOKING TO GET RICH BY MAKING YOUR CONSTITUENTS OR PLEASE DON'T LET WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE. HAPPEN AGAIN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISSPELLED. CALIFORNIA REINVESTS COALITION. GOOD AFTERNOON TEARS MITCHELL AND BRADFORD AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES I'M JOKES FOR BAJA CALIFORNIA REINVESTMENT COALITION WE REPRESENT THREE HUNDRED COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE AND IN BOTH URBAN AND RURAL AREAS. AND AS YOU KNOW THE DEPTH OF THE CULTURE CRISIS ARE RAPIDLY ECLIPSING WHAT WE SIGNED TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ONE OF THE MOST DEVASTATING LEGACIES OF THAT CRISIS IS THAT IT WAS ONE OF THE LARGEST TRANSFERS OF WEALTH IN THE COUNTRY'S ISTORY AND THAT WEALTH LOSS WAS EXPERIENCED MOST GREATLY IN BOOKS BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES AS YOU ALSO KNOW THIS TRANSFER OF WILD HAPPENS MOST PROMINENTLY WHEN LOSE THEIR BUSINESSES AND WHEN THEY LOSE THEIR HOMES. IN RESPONSE CFPB WAS CREATED BACK THEN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND AS MANY AS THEY MOVE AWAY FROM THEIR ORIGINAL MISSION SMALL BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS ARE SUFFERING A STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION CAN BE INSTRUMENTAL IN PROTECTING HISTORICALLY DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES FROM EXPERIENCING WHILE LOST HE DIDLEAVE THE COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE FACED STRUCTURAL BARRIERS TO BUILD WEALTH TO BEGIN WITH CAN BE PROTECTED FROM HAVING TO START ALL OVER WITH EACH CRISIS BY OUR ACTIONS. FIRST ALL ADDRESS A SMALL BUSINESS MEANS THE DATA'S OUT ITS BLACK AND LATINOS WHO ARE LOSING THEIR ONCE PROFITABLE BUSINESSES NOW ALL OF THE DATA THAT IS AVAILABLE REGARDING THE PPP LOANS ONLY 2% OF THE RECIPIENTS BOTH BUSINESSES AND ONLY 6% WERE LATINOS THIS IS DUE TO THE- ACTUAL. COMBAT IT BANK EVEN TODAY IN RESPONSE TO THIS JUST WEEKS AFTER IN APRIL THIS YEAR JUST WEEKS AFTER THE SHUTDOWN WE SURVEYED OUR MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS AND ALREADY MANY WERE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE UNFAIR DECEPTIVE LENDING LENDERS WHO OPERATE WITH IMPUNITY OUR MEMBERS WERE WORRIED BECAUSE THEY HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE LITTLE TO NO ACCESS TO SAY FINANCIAL PRODUCTS DUE TO DISCRIMINATION IN LENDING MUCH LIKE WHAT WE SAW WITH THE ROLLOUT OF THE PPP. SO OUR COMMUNITIES. TRYING TO MERCHANT CASH ADVANCE OUTSIDE ONCE. BUSINESSES BUSINESS OWNERS. THE PREDATOR NATURE THE LOAN. THEY BACK FOR. REFINANCE BUT OFTEN IT'S TOO LATE AND- HAVE SMALL BUSINESSES. LEAVE SMALL BUSINESSES STOCK WITH HIGH INTEREST RATES AND HIDDEN FEES. LEADING TO PAINFUL APR LEVELS AND MANY MAKE YOU SIGN A WAIVER ALLOWING THEM TO SEIZE YOUR ASSETS WITHOUT WARNING. JUST THIS MONTH WE HAVE OUR MEMBERS CALLING TO TROUBLESHOOT HOW TO SAVE A BIG RESTAURANT IN SAN FRANCISCO. DON RAMON'S A LANDMARK RESTAURANT IS CURRENTLY FIGHTING TO KEEP THEIR BUILDINGS ARE BEING SOLD AT AUCTION IN THIRTEEN DAYS FROM TODAY. GHALI TOOK OUT OF WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE A PREDATORY LOAN. FOR THE SAKE OF CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES LIKE DON RAMON'S REVAMPING THE DVO INTO ON THIS NEW MISSION DRIVEN CONSUMER FACING AGENCY AS THE DS PAI IS URGENTLY NEEDED THIS YEAR. SO THAT THESE BUSINESSES CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY AND HANG ON TO THEIR WEALTH. NOW ABOUT THE HOMES. CALIFORNIA MUST ENSURE WE DON'T REPEAT MISTAKES MADE DURING THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS IN ALLOWING LARGE CORPORATE LANDLORDS PRIVATE EQUITY AND OTHER SPECULATORS GOBBLE UP DISTRESSED PROPERTIES AND FUEL ANOTHER WAVE OF DISPLACEMENT OF THE STATE'S WORKING FAMILIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND SMALL BUSINESSES. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE STATE ADOPTED ANTI DISPLACEMENT CODE OF CONDUCT POLICY THAT TOGETHER WITH THE REVAMPS DPO COULD ENSURE THAT LENDERS TO THE FOLLOWING SOME OF THE FOLLOWING. HAVE AN EQUITABLE APPROACH TO A SUCCESSFULLY OFFERING JUST RE FINANCING TO HOMEOWNERS EXPERIENCING WAGE LOSSES AT TIMES LIKE THESE. AND IN CASE OF MULTI FAMILY OR MIXED USE BUILDINGS UNDERWRITE LOANS BASED ON RENTS THAT CURRENT RESIDENTIAL NONPROFIT AND BUSINESS TENANTS ARE PAYING NOT INCREASED RIGHT. CLEAN OUT OF BORROWER LANDLORDS THAT HAVE A BUSINESS MODEL OF DISPLAYS ARE DISPLACING TENANTS DOES EXIST WE CALL THOSE LANDLORDS YOUR ELECTORS. WE EXPECT THE PANDEMIC TO CONTINUE TO DISRUPT OUR LIVES FOR SOMETIME IF WE FAIL TO ACT NOW WE MAY CREATE A VICIOUS CYCLE IN WHICH UNSCRUPULOUS ACTORS GO UN CHECKED AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES WHO TURN COULD FALL FURTHER BEHIND AND BE UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR EVENTUAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY. A NEW D. S. P. I CAN ENSURE THAT LENDERS SUPPORT COMMUNITIES IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS ALL TO PROSPER WE ARE READY TO WORK WITH YOU THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TO MAKE THIS A REALITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER GOULD CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION. BETTER CHAIR MISTER CHAIR SENATORS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO REORGANIZE THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION I WANT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO MEET WITH US AND OUR WILLINGNESS TO EXPLORE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION WITH THE COMMISSIONER AND HIS TEAM. WE APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT'S EMPHASIS ON INNOVATION AND WE HOPE THESE EFFORTS WILL PROMOTE THE SUCCESS OF ITS LICENSEES. AND SERVE AS A CATALYST TO RETAIN AND GROW THE NUMBER OF LICENSEES. PARTICULARLY GIVEN CONTINUED CONSOLIDATION IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY. TO UNDERSCORE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS MISSION IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTEEN STATE CHARTERED BANKS COMPARED TO ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE STATE CHARTERED BANKS TODAY. IT'S R. O. THE DEPARTMENT WILL IDENTIFY INNOVATIVE WAYS TO ENCOURAGE NEW BANKS FORMATIONS WHICH IS VITAL IN ENSURING THE ECONOMIC SUCCESS OF OUR STATE. IN THAT COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS TO FINANCIAL SERVICES. WE APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR'S DESIRE TO PROVIDE A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND SUPERVISION FOR UNREGULATED ENTITIES. THEY'RE OFFERING FINANCIAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IF DONE CORRECTLY SUCH AN APPROACH WOULD ENSURE GREATER CONSUMER PROTECTION AND LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD AMONG THOSE PROVIDING FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WITHOUT OBJECTIFIED WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THIS PROPOSALS. BE NARROWED TO FOCUS SOLELY ON ON REGULATED ENTITIES AND THAT LICENSED ENTITIES BE EXEMPT FROM THE ENTIRETY OF THE PROPOSAL. IN FACT THERE'S PRECEDENT FOR WHAT WE ARE REQUESTING IN THIS VERY TRAILER BILL. THE VERY EXEMPTION WE ARE REQUESTING HAS ALREADY BEEN GRANTED THE LICENSEES OF EVERY OTHER STATE AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT. SUCH AS THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE. THIS CAN BE FOUND IN SECTION NINE ZERO ZERO ZERO TWO SUBDIVISION A- WE'RE ASKING FOR THE SAME TREATMENT THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED TO LICENSEES OF OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND WE'RE EVEN WILLING TO UNDERSCORE THE FACT THAT NOTHING IN THE EXEMPTION WOULD ALTER. THE STATE'S ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY THAT IS PRESENTLY AVAILABLE UNDER DODD FRANK. TO FURTHER OUR REQUEST LICENSE ENTITIES BE EXEMPT FROM THE PROPOSAL BANKS ARE ALREADY SUBJECT TO LICENSING AND ARE SUPERVISED BY MULTIPLE REGULATORS. STATE CHARTERED BANKS ARE LICENSED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT AND SUBJECT AT A MINIMUM TO ADDITIONAL SUPERVISION BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION. AND THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. WELL FEDERALLY CHARTERED BANKS ARE LICENSED BY THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AND SUBJECT AT A MINIMUM TO ADDITIONAL SUPERVISION BY THE FDIC AND CFPB. IN ORDER FOR A BANK TO SECURE A LICENSE THEY MUST PROVE TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT THEY'RE WORTHY OF RECEIVING THAT LICENSE. THROUGH A BUSINESS PLAN COMPLETE AN EXTENSIVE APPLICATION GATHERING THE CAPITAL NECESSARY FOR FORMATION AND DEMONSTRATING THAT THEY HAVE A REASONABLE CHANCE OF SUCCESS. RATES ARE SUBJECT TO FREQUENT AUDITS AND EXAMS WHERE THEY MUST PROVE THAT THEY OPERATE IN A SAFE AND SOUND MANNER. ADEQUATE CAPITAL TO WHETHER ECONOMIC SHOCKS THEIR ASSET QUALITY IS HIGH THEIR MANAGEMENT TEAM QUALIFIED THEY CAN PRODUCE EARNINGS CAN DEMONSTRATE LIQUIDITY TO PAY THEIR DEPOSITORS. AND HAVE A SYSTEM IN SPIN PLACE TO BE SENSITIVE TO CHANGING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENTS. THANKS ARE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC AUDIT AND EXAMINATION BY THE DEPARTMENT WHICH GIVES A REGULATOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO IDENTIFY EMERGING ISSUES AND TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION EARLY. THESE ON SITE EXAMINATIONS INCLUDE EXTENSIVE PRE ENTRY LETTERS REQUIRED THE GATHERING OF EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION AND DEPARTMENT EXAM STAFF. PHYSICALLY PRESENT ON A BANK PROPERTY FOR MULTIPLE DAYS. LICENSING PROVISIONS IN CURRENT LOG AROUND REGULATORS WITH ROBUST ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY INCLUDING CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS AGAINST PERSONS AND INSTITUTIONS SIXTEEN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES SUSPENDING OR REMOVING PERSONS OR PROHIBITING THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE FUTURE WITH AN INSTITUTION. REVOKING OR SUSPENDING A LICENSE AND TAKING POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTY AND BUSINESS OF THE LICENSEE. ON TOP OF ALL OF THIS THE STATE HAS AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE PROVISIONS OF TITLE TEN OF DODD FRANK FOR WHICH THIS PROPOSAL RESEMBLES. WE HEARD EARLIER IN THE TESTIMONY THAT THEY WERE ADEQUATE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE BELIEVE THE EXEMPTION MAKES SENSE. IN SUMMARY WE BELIEVE THAT ENHANCE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ALREADY EXIST WITHIN THE LICENSE COMMUNITY. ARE OVERSIGHT IS ROBUST AND MULTIFACETED AND THE ENFORCEMENT TOOLS AVAILABLE TO OUR REGULATORS IS NOT LACKING FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST OF LICENSED ENTITIES BE EXEMPT. IF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY. THANK YOU WITH THE GOLD AND NOW WE HEAR FROM OUR FINAL A WITNESS IN THE THIS PANEL- MISTER GOVERNOR CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MATTER CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU AND YOUR COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE COMMISSIONER AND HIS TEAM. FOR PROVIDING US AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US CERTAINLY MY CLIENT CONCURS WITH THE SENTIMENTS OF MISTER GOLDMAN CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION. ALTHOUGH AS A NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE REYES TODAY I ALSO HAPPEN TO READ REPRESENT PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE REGISTRANTS HE AND THE LACK OF CLARITY IN THE PROPOSAL IS VERY TROUBLING. AS THE L. A. L. NOTED THIS DOES SEATED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF FORTY TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE BRANCH. AS SUCH WE THINK THE LANGUAGE AROUND REGULATION SHOULD BE CLARIFIED. SPECIFICALLY THROUGHOUT THE BILL IT PROVIDES THAT D. FBI MAY PROMULGATE REGULATIONS CONCERNING REGISTRATION. MAY PROMULGATE REGULATIONS CONCERNING DISCLOSURE. RECORDS RETENTION- AND ON AND ON AND ON. FRANKLY I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE REGULATED COMMUNITY- REGISTRANTS CAN ADHERE TO RULES THAT THEY DON'T KNOW EXIST. THIS IS EASILY RECTIFIED IF THE WORD MAY IS REPLACED WITH SHALL THROUGHOUT THE PROPOSAL AT LEAST THEN. THE REGULATE COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THE PROCESS AND AT LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY ARE SUBJECT. TO SOMETHING THAT SENATOR COUNTY RAISED. HAD TO DO WITH THE NUMBERS OF GROUPS INVOLVED- THERE IS ACTUALLY ONE ADDITIONAL GROUP OF IRAQIS TO BE COVERED BY THIS BILL. AND THAT ARE THAT IS COMPANIES OR ENTITIES WHO ARE NOT LICENSED. BUT WHO ARE REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE- THERE ARE A HOST OF BACKS FROM THE CARNEDDAU REESE LEVERING AND CHECK CASHIER'S. WHO ARE SUBJECT TO AUTHORITY BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TODAY. THE CONCERN WE HAVE THE BILL WE WILL CERTAINLY RAISE THIS WITH- DPO IS AS DRAFTED. D. O. J. COULD BRING AN ACTION FOR A VIOLATION- FROM ONE OF THEIR REGULATED ENTITIES. THE FBI COULD THEN BRINGTHE EXACT SAME CIVIL ACTION ALLEGING THAT YOU THAT WHILE ISSUE AGAINST THAT SAME EDUCATE. THIS MEANS THE ENTITIES ARE ALREADY COVERED BY EXISTING LAW WHO ARE UNLICENSED WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED- MORE STRIDENT OVERSIGHT THAT ENTITIES THAT ARE COMPLETELY UNREGULATED WE THINK THIS pTOO AGENCY SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GO OUT TO THE SAME ENTITY WITH THE EXACT SAME THING. FINALLY THERE'S A PROVISION IN THE GOVERNMENT COAT THAT'S REFERENCED IN THE BILL THAT DEALS WITH DUE PROCESS I'M NOT SURE IF THIS IS A TYPE OR NOT. BUT THE BILL ONLY REFERENCES HALF OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE LEAVES OUT THE DUE PROCESS PROVISIONS THIS IS EASILY FIXED. AND THE BILL PROVIDES THAT THE DEPARTMENT MAY RECOVER ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COURT ACTION. IF THEY PREVAIL HOWEVER IF THEY LOSE THE PARTY THAT PREVAILED IS NOT ENTITLED TO ATTORNEYS FEES. WE THINK THIS IS INEQUITABLE WE ASK THAT THIS BE. FIXED WE PROVIDE ALL THESE SUGGESTIONS TO THAT APARTMENT. AND WITH TWO WEEKS LEFT TO GO WE'VE NOT HEARD BACK ON THEM. AND WOULD WELCOME THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO RECTIFY THESE PROBLEMS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME WE APPRECIATE. YOUR EFFORTS AND HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. YOU ALL ARE OF YOUR SATURDAY AFTERNOON- BEFORE I OPEN UP TO THE FLOOR I WOULD JUST SAY THE MISS- BOTTLE I WAS INTRIGUED BY YOUR COMMENT ABOUT AN ANTI DISPLACEMENT CODE OF CONDUCT AND SO IF YOU COULD. TO SINCE THEN BACKGROUND MATERIALS TO MY OFFICE I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT. QUESTIONS MEMBERS HAVE. QUESTIONS OF THE PANEL. SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION BY THE PANEL ON THE DIFFERENT IDEAS AND CONCEPTS THAT WERE PUT FORTH I GUESS WHY DON'T. WHERE I DON'T SEE AND I HOPE THAT WILL HAPPEN IS SORT OF A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE PRESS. LEAST WHAT IS IN THE TRAILER BILL AND SOME OF THESE IDEAS WHICH I THINK MANY OF THEM ARE VERY GOOD- SO. AS I EXPRESSED IN MY EARLIER QUITE YOU KNOW QUESTIONS WHY I'M CONCERNED IS THAT WERE BEING ASKED ARE I KNOW THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING WILL EVENTUALLY BE ASKED TO VOTE ON A- TRAILER BILL AND I CERTAINLY HAVE SOME CONCERNS WHETHER THIS IS REALLY TRAILER BILL VERSUS- POLICY BILL THAT WE WON'T GET INTO THAT TOO MUCH WE DO DO. IT SOMETIMES THINGS HAPPEN BUT BUT THAT IT'S NOT VETTED WELL ENOUGH AND IN FACT- THAT WAY I DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN IS BASICALLY A SORT OF A CATCHALL TRAILER BILL THAT SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS OUT THERE- NO LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. WE EXPECT INDUSTRIES IS GONNA CARRY THEM OUT AND HOPE THAT YOU DO THAT. RIGHT I MEAN I THINK WE NEED TO BE MUCH MORE SPECIFIC- THERE NEEDS TO BE MUCH MORE SPECIFICITY ABOUT WHO WILL FALL UNDER THIS I MEAN WHEN I POSE THE QUESTION ABOUT. THE ODD COMMISSIONER REALLY ANY DANCER I THINK WAS A LITTLE CONCERNING- THAT NEEDS TO BE VERY MUCH CLARIFIED WHO FALLS UNDER THIS BILL WHAT'S THE SCOPE OF THIS AGENCY- I GET IT YOU HAVE ON THE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT LICENSED DAY OF PRIDE THE DETAILED. OVERSIGHT LORALAI. WHAT MISSING FOR THERE OVER. THAT THEIR CURRENT LICENSE DOESN'T COVER ANY WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE PEOPLE HAVING TO RESPOND TO. MULTIPLE AGENCIES WHO WHICH MAY EVEN HAVE GIVE CONFLICTING GUIDANCE I MEAN THAT'S AN ISSUE AS WELL THAT. THAT WOULD ACTUALLY STYMIE OUR LIMIT POTENTIALLY ACCESS TO CREDIT THAT PEOPLE CAN GET. AS WELL- WE ALSO WE ONLY LIKE TO DISCOURAGE. THAT BEHAVIOR THAT ISN'T GOOD FOR COMMUNITIES AND I APPRECIATE SOME OF THOSE PRESENTATIONS WHICH MAY NOT STRICTLY BE IN A LENDING PRACTICES PER SE BUT ALSO BUT YOU KNOW I'M FIGURE HAVE INCORPORATE SOME OF THAT- SO I GUESS WHAT I JUST SAY IS THAT- CERTAINLY THIS INFORMATION HEARINGS BEEN RAIN AND LIGHTNING- BUT- I. YEAH WE HAVE TO DO THIS RIGHT. AND I CERTAINLY HEAR THE URGENCY ISSUE I'M NOT DENYING THE URGENCY BUT THE URGENCY ALONE IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO PASS. A BETTER POLICY THAT IS THAT IS NOT WELL THOUGHT OUT AND IT IT AND FRANKLY I DO ALSO WANT TO JUST AGAIN SECOND THE- WHAT SENATOR RAZA SAID IS THAT IT'S- THE- OTHER QUESTION IS THERE TO BAN WITHIN THE- ADMINISTRATION TO SPEND THE TIME TO DO THIS RIGHT. AND RECOGNIZING THAT WE ALSO HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES WERE DOING NOT SAYING THAT WE CAN'T DO THIS. BUT I WANT TO SEE A COMMITMENT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. TO REALLY WORK THESE THINGS OUT NOT EXPECT THE LEGISLATURE SIMPLY TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA PASS AND OPEN ENDED ONE AND THEN WE'LL WE'LL FIGURE OUT LATER WE NEED TO KNOW THE ANSWERS NOW BEFORE WE- AS A LEGISLATURE WILL VOTE ON THIS. THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THAT AND YOU KNOW I YES YOU ACKNOWLEDGES IT THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING IN THE POINT OF THE- HELLO IS TO SHARE PERSPECTIVES AND NOT ONLY RESPOND TO THE PROPOSAL BEFORE US BUT TO TALK ABOUT. THEIR EXPERIENCES PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD IN THE INDUSTRY TO ENLIGHTEN US ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON OUT. IN THE STATE'S GOING TO BE ON OUR OWN KNOWLEDGE BASE IN OUR OWN DISTRICTS. SO IT'S A IT'S A TWO FOR IF YOU WILL DR PAM. CENTER WHERE CAL SKI. FOR A QUESTION FOR TRACTOR. INJURY BECAUSE HE MAY BE IN A UNIQUE. HER THE POSITION LECH'S PRETENDED A BIDEN HERIS TICKET PASSES AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A ROBUST FEDERAL CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY M. WE ADOPT THIS. REGULATION AND WE HAVE A REAL BUS STATE CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY HOW CAN YOU SPEAK TO AT LEAST FOR THE REGULATED COMMUNITY THAT THEY'RE NOT CAUGHT BETWEEN THE CROSSFIRE OF THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS TRYING TO. ONE UP EACH OTHER WITH REGARD TO TRYING TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL SERVICES AND CONDUCT BUSINESS IN THIS ARENA. THANK YOU SENATOR. ONE POINT. IS THE ONE I MADE BEFORE WHICH IS THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DEPEND ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON IS THE WEATHER CALIFORNIANS GIVE PROTECTION AGAINST FINANCIAL ABUSE AND THE POINT THAT WAS MADE EARLIER BY THE QUESTIONS. FROM SENATOR RON AND OTHERS WAS THAT THE FEDERAL LAW HAD NOT BEEN USED BY THE CALIFORNIA AGENCY YEAH I THINK THAT'S KIND OF TO BE EXPECTED IT'S NOT A NATURAL THING FOR A STATE AGENCY TO TRY TO ENFORCE FEDERAL LAW AND TRY TO CRAM IT INTO EXISTING STATE LICENSE ACTIONS AND IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A CLEARLY SUBJECT THE CALIFORNIA EIGHTY A THE KEY HERE IS TO GET THIS PROTECTION IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE LAW. THE DEPARTMENT KNOWS VERY WELL HOW IT CAN WORK WITH THAT IT KNOWS THE PROPER PROCESSES IN LICENSE ACTIONS IT IS SUBJECT TO CALIFORNIA'S DUE PROCESS PROVISION THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION AND ALSO WITH THE EIGHTY EIGHT SO THAT'S IMPORTANT THE OTHER POINT I WOULD MAKE IS WHEN I WAS THE DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL CFPB AND WE WERE MORE AGGRESSIVE CLEARLY THEN THE CFPB HAS BEEN IT'S ALMOST BEEN PARALYZED IN TERMS OF ENFORCING THE LAW. WE KNEW WE COULDN'T POSSIBLY ASK ALL THE CONCERNS AND ISSUES THAT WOULD BEING RAISED IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA WE DIDN'T KNOW THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AS WELL WE WOULD SOMETIMES GET REFERRALS AND THINGS AND WE WOULD ACT. THE BEST SITUATION IS TO HAVE A REAL PARTNERSHIP WITH. OFFICIALS ARE OUT FOR CALIFORNIA. FOR NOT HAVING TO ON WHAT HOW IN WASHINGTON DC BUT IF THERE IS APPETITE AND- DC TO WERE WITH THEM. BUT THERE'S JOIN EFFORTS AND COOPERATION COOPERATIVE FEDERALISM WHICH IS WHAT THE DODD FRANK ACT. PROVIDED FOR THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO ACCEPT THIS INVITATION IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT REAL AND FRANKLY NEEDS TO ACCEPT IT NOW BECAUSE IF YOU PUT THIS FACT INTO ANOTHER PROCESS. IT'LL BE ANOTHER YEAR AND THEN ANOTHER YEAR AFTER THAT BEFORE IT BECOMES LAW YOU'RE GONNA MISS THIS WHOLE CRISIS ALTOGETHER. THAT WOULD BE A TRAGEDY FOR CALIFORNIANS BUT I THINK THEY'RE BEING. AYE HAMBURGERS AYE SAID RIGHT NOW. READING AUTHORED FORECASTING THANKS GREAT THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS. ANYMORE IT LASTED FOR. SENATOR CABALLERO I KNOW YOU HAD SOME REMARKS YOU WANT TO MAKE AFTER THE PANEL CONCLUDED. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY A FEW THINGS THAT I WANTED TO WAIT TILL AFTER THE PANEL HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BECAUSE I WANTED TO HEAR WITH THE PANEL HAD TO SAY. AND I WANT TO THANK YOU AND I UNDERSTAND- THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN REGARDS TO- THE NEED TO PROTECT THE COMMUNITY THERE'S NO QUESTION I MEAN THAT THAT IN MY MIND AT EASE AND QUESTIONED ITS IT'S REALLY WHAT. WHAT D. B. O.'S CORE MISSION IS IN AND IN FACT ALL OF THE REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT LOCAL OVERLOOK LICENSEES IN THAT THAT- THAT DO HEIR ENFORCEMENT MY CONCERN IS THIS AND I. AND I GUESS. THERE'S A WOULD TO ME THERE'S THIS DISCONNECT. I'M ASSUMING WE PASS THIS. TODAY WHENEVER WE FINALLY GET IT FOR A VOTE ON THE FIRST YEAR IS IT IS A IS A SKELETAL COMPOSITION IS WHAT I HEARD AND- AND SO TO THINK THAT THIS BILL OR THIS TRAILER BILL WILL ACTUALLY START IMPACTING. THE UNREGULATED UNLICENSED ENTITIES THAT ARE ACTING RIGHT NOW I JUST THINK IT'S UNREALISTIC I DON'T I DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING IN AND MAYBE I'M I'M WRONG BUT- BUT I UNDERSTAND HOW THE REGULATORY PROCESS WORKS HAVING. SUPERVISED THAT BEFORE AND IT TAKES A WHILE TO ON. IT TAKES A WHILE BASICALLY TO HIRE STAFF TO GET HIM TRAINED TO GET HIM WORKING TOGETHER TO GET THE REGULATIONS IN ORDER. AND THEN TO START DOING THAT THE OVERSIGHT THAT'S NEEDED THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S NOT NEEDED. RIGHT NOW I'M JUST SAYING THAT THAT I DON'T SEE I DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING AND SO PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT I HAVE IS I THOUGHT THE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED TODAY WERE EXCELLENT I. I HAD A I'VE GOT I'VE GOT A BUNCH AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF A MORE ASKED BY SOMEONE ELSE AND SO THE CHALLENGE FOR ME IS PROCESS. IS THAT I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT THE WAY THAT WE STAND UP A REORGANIZATION OF THE DEPARTMENT BOB IS USUALLY TWO FOLD ONE IS IT'S THROUGH THE BUDGET I MEAN THROUGH THE- A BILLPROCESS YOU GET SOME LEGISLATOR TO KERRY THE ADMINISTRATION'S BILL AND TO TAKE IT TO THE POLICY COMMITTEES. OR YOU TAKE UP THE PROCESS THAT IS WRITTEN. I BELIEVE IT'S IN THE CONSTITUTION THE TAKE YOU TAKE IT THROUGH THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION AND WHAT YOU DO IS YOU HAVE A BUSINESS PLAN AND THE BUT THE BUSINESS PLAN ARTICULATES EXACTLY WHAT IT IS YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH A REORGANIZATION. IT GOES THROUGH THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION THEY HOLD HEARINGS AND THEN THAT PLAN COMES TO THE LEGISLATURE AND WE EITHER GIVE IT THE THUMBS UP OR THE THUMBS DOWN WE CAN'T CHANGE IT WE CAN'T AMENDED. ON IT IT IT IT IT EXISTS AS AS IT TOO IT WAS WRITTEN BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND NEITHER OF THOSE WORDS WERE DOWN HERE AND THAT. THOSE PROCESSES GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR THIS CAN THIS IN COMMITTEE AND REALLY HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF WHO ARE WE TRYING TO REGULATE. IT OR THE REGULATION WHAT'S THE FRAMEWORK FOR THE REGULATION WHO'S GOING TO DO IT HOW DID IT HOW IS IT GOING TO HAPPEN AND THEN WHAT IS IT GOING TO COST AND THAT HASN'T THAT HASN'T HAPPENED WE'VE WE'VE TRIED TO DO IT. BACKWARDS BY SAYING HERE'S A BUDGET HERE'S WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST AND TRUST US WE CAN WE CAN GET OUT THERE AND AN APPROPRIATELY. REGULATE THESE ENTITIES AND I'M NOT SURE I HAVE A REAL GOOD SAID OF. WHO WOULD BE REGULATED. OTHER THAN I'M LICENSED AND UNREGULATED. AND THEN WHAT WOULD BE THE FRAMEWORK FOR REGULATING THEM AND HOW DO WE EVALUATE- THAT THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE. AND QUITE FRANKLY I. I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THERE IS CONSUMER DISTRESS. BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF MONEY RIGHT NOW. AND THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SITUATION I GET REGULAR CALLS ON THE PHONE. THAT TELL ME THAT I AM BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE IRS AND THEN I BETTER SENT YET. GET UP GET A CALL IMMEDIATELY pWRITTEN AND- AND IT'S BECOME MORE APPARENT THE OLDER I GET RIGHT BECAUSE IF THEY'RE PREYING ON ON SENIORS. SO ANYWAY I JUST I HAVE A- WE'LL SEE WHERE THIS GOES IN THE END BUT I HAVE A REAL PROBLEM WITH TRYING TO DO THIS THROUGH A BUDGET PROCESS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE. I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I APPRECIATE. ON THE COMMISSIONER AND ALL THE WORK THAT HE'S DONE. BECAUSE HE'S BEEN IN CONTACT WITH. MY OFFICE AND ME AND NUMBER OF TIMES AND WE'VE TALKED THROUGH A NUMBER OF THESE ISSUES A CHEST. IT'S JUST THAT THIS IS A DIFFICULT PROCESS TO USE TO GET. TO GET TO THE GOAL AND SO I. I DO THINK THAT THAT- THAT THIS IS. THAT THE QUESTION THAT A BRICK BEEN RAZOR REALLY TROUBLING SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR. AND IN I WOULD ASK- THE COMMISSIONER TO RESPOND TO THAT IN ADDITION TO- IN ADDITION TO CALLS TO YOU AND OTHER MEMBERS AYE I'M CLEAR THAT THAT THAT YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF. AND SOME YOU KNOW BACK AND FORTH AS HAPPENED WITH REGARD TO CONTENT BUT BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION IS AS TO WHETHER ANY ADDITIONAL CHANGES. ON THE BASE OF THE LANGUAGE WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY DO YOU INTEND TO MAKE. MORE ADJUSTMENTS TO YOUR TIMELINE. THANK YOU SENATOR WE DO ANTICIPATE WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL CHANGES. ON AN EXPEDITED BASIS WERE- WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH US- IN MINISTRATION LEADERSHIP. IN FACT I- ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL BE. RECONVENING ARE SOME OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS AFTER THIS HEARING. INTO THE EVENING AND TOMORROW SO. THE UPSHOT IS YES- THERE ARE VERY LIKELY TO BE ADDITIONAL CHANGES AND WE ARE- UNDERSTANDING- ALL OF THE- ALL THE VALID CONCERNS ABOUT TIMING HERE WE'RE OF COURSE- SPRINTING AS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- LOCKSTEP WITH WITH ADMINISTRATION LEADERSHIP TO. TO GET. FINAL REVISIONS BACK OVER TO LEGISLATIVE STAFF EXCEPT. THANK YOU AND BEFORE I OPENED IT UP- TO PUBLIC COMMENT ON WHEN TO GIVE LA- FINANCE OR THE COMMISSION OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO ANYTHING YOU'VE HEARD EITHER FROM THAT MEMBERS QUESTIONS THE PANELISTS. ANY RESPONSES BEFORE WE OPENED UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT. YES THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL THIS IS KIMBERLY HARBISON. FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND WE THANK YOU FOR THE ROBUST CONVERSATION TODAY AND THERE ARE A FEW POINTS I JUST WANTED TO. RESPECTFULLY ADDRESS WE KNOW THAT THIS HAS BEEN A VERY UNUSUAL YEAR AND THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND CALENDAR. HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY DISRUPTED BY COVERED BUT WE DID THE- FIRST PRESENT THIS AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IN JANUARY THE LANGUAGE HAS BEEN OUT- MANY MONTHS SINCE JANUARY FEBRUARY. AND AS AS BEEN NOTED A FEW TIMES WE HAVE DONE EXTENSIVE. OUTREACH TO LET STAFF LEGISLATORS- STAKEHOLDERS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE SO. ALTHOUGH IT IS COMING DOWN TO THE END OF THE SESSION WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE HAD. YOU KNOW THOROUGH AND ROBUST CONVERSATIONS WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS. I'M YOURSELVES INCLUDED- THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT SB NINE OH EIGHT PASSES AND IF IT DOES. WE WOULD TAKE THE CONSIDERATIONS OF WHAT THIS PROPOSAL COSTS- IF IT PASSES AND THEN IF SB NINE AWAIT PASSES. THE DEPARTMENT WOULD PUT TOGETHER B. C. P. AND THE NEXT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE COST DIFFERENCES SO IT WOULDN'T BE A DUPLICATION OF COST OR EFFORT BUT IT WOULD FACTOR IN THIS PROPOSAL AS WELL- AND WE'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND EFFORTS- TO HEAR ALL THIS TODAY. I'D ALSO LIKE TO. DRESS THE PART ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION WE DON'T SEE THIS AS A TYPICAL WE'RE WE ORGANIZATION IT'S MORE OF A ADDITION TO THE DEPARTMENT SO I THINK IF WE WEREN'T CHANGING THE NAME OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT TO FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND INNOVATION THERE MIGHT BE A LITTLE LESS CONFUSION ON THAT BECAUSE IT'S THAT WERE SIMPLY ADDING NEW FUNCTION TO AN EXISTING DEPARTMENT. SO THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT GONE THROUGH THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION WE DON'T FEEL THAT IT IS THAT WE ARE IF WE THINK IT'S AN ADDITION OF MORE STAFF TO ENHANCE EXISTING THINGS AND DO PROTECTION THAT'S NEEDED NOW AND IS A FEW MEMBERS OF SAID. THERE IS SOME RAMP UP SOME LEAD TIME TO HIRING INTO STEPPING UP INTO DOING REGULATIONS BUT IF WE DON'T START NOW THEN IT ONLY FURTHERS. THE POINT WITH WHICH WE CAN ACTUALLY HELP CONSUMERS SO WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO. FACTOR THAT INTO YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WITH THAT WE'LL OPEN IT UP TO- PUBLIC COMMENT WILL MOVE NOW TO ANYONE WAITING.
