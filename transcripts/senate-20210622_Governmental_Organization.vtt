ABOUT THAT- THE- THE OTHER ONE

00:21:05.897 --> 00:21:10.502
IS I GUESS. ISN'T IT I GUESS

00:21:10.569 --> 00:21:12.170
THE PROBLEM WITH THESE BUY

00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:15.674
SEEDS IS MORE- THE PEOPLE.

00:21:15.741 --> 00:21:16.975
DEVELOPING THESE PROGRAMS AND

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:18.844
PUTTING YOU INSERTING THIS

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:19.678
TECHNOLOGY INTO THAT IT

00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:21.880
DETECTS. OR INTERPRETED BY

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:23.281
SEASON CERTAINLY IT'S NOT THE

00:21:23.348 --> 00:21:24.416
MACHINERY ITSELF IN OTHER WORDS

00:21:24.483 --> 00:21:25.984
NOTHING AND NUTS AND BOLTS IT'S

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:27.686
THE PEOPLE. BEHIND IT AND I'M

00:21:27.753 --> 00:21:29.988
NOT SURE YOU SEE THAT. THE BILL

00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:31.957
ADDRESSES THAT WOULD YOU CARE

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:35.193
TO- COMMENTER CLARIFY THAT.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.862
ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:21:36.928 --> 00:21:38.830
FOR YOUR QUESTIONS US SENATOR I

00:21:38.897 --> 00:21:41.400
THINK- ANYTIME WE TALK ABOUT

00:21:41.466 --> 00:21:43.535
THE COST OF A PRODUCT FOR

00:21:43.602 --> 00:21:46.204
EXAMPLE. A WE SHOULD DEFINITELY

00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:47.706
ARE CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY

00:21:47.773 --> 00:21:49.708
THAT WHEN STATE AGENCIES

00:21:49.775 --> 00:21:51.410
PURCHASE THESE PRODUCTS OR

00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:53.779
SYSTEMS ARE EDS SYSTEMS. AT A

00:21:53.845 --> 00:21:55.881
COST THAT IT WOULD BEEN CURVE

00:21:55.947 --> 00:21:57.916
TO THE GENERAL POPULATION IF

00:21:57.983 --> 00:22:00.485
THE SYSTEMS CONTAIN ANY BIASES

00:22:00.552 --> 00:22:03.422
OR DISCRIMINATORY. IMPACT HE

00:22:03.488 --> 00:22:05.624
HAD PROBLEM WITH. SOME OF THE

00:22:05.691 --> 00:22:07.693
SYSTEMS IS THAT THEY OPERATE AS

00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:10.028
BLACK BOXES NOBODY REALLY KNOWS

00:22:10.095 --> 00:22:12.130
WHAT GOES INTO THE BLACK BOX.

00:22:12.197 --> 00:22:14.733
AND THEY USE THESE SYSTEMS

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.601
MOSTLY ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:18.437
SYSTEMS THEY PUT DATA IN THAT

00:22:18.503 --> 00:22:20.439
THEY PUT BIG DATA SO TO SPEAK

00:22:20.505 --> 00:22:21.373
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.809
ANALYTICS. AND THEY PRODUCE AN

00:22:23.875 --> 00:22:25.110
OUTCOME THAT WOULD HELP THEM

00:22:25.177 --> 00:22:27.512
MAKE DECISIONS. THE PROBLEM IS

00:22:27.579 --> 00:22:28.914
YOU KNOW THE SYSTEMS NOBODY

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:32.317
REALLY KNOWS WHAT THEY DO. AND

00:22:32.384 --> 00:22:33.618
WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS TO SHINE

00:22:33.685 --> 00:22:36.221
SOME LIGHT ON THESE BLACK BOXES

00:22:36.288 --> 00:22:37.956
AND THE IMPACT ASSESSMENT THAT

00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:39.758
WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO IS

00:22:39.825 --> 00:22:42.627
ESSENTIALLY. TO HOW INTEL IS

00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:44.730
WHAT THESE SYSTEMS DO HOW THEY

00:22:44.796 --> 00:22:46.498
OPERATE WHAT THE PICK A

00:22:46.565 --> 00:22:47.966
CAPABILITIES ARE WHAT THE

00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:49.501
LIMITATIONS ARE AND WHETHER OR

00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:51.269
NOT TO DISCRIMINATE WILL CREATE

00:22:51.336 --> 00:22:53.705
BIASES. YOU'RE RIGHT I THINK A

00:22:53.772 --> 00:22:54.639
LOT OF THESE DECISIONS GOOD

00:22:54.706 --> 00:22:58.176
COLIN. ARE FROM HUMAN BEINGS

00:22:58.243 --> 00:22:59.444
SIX SIX PEOPLE HAVE BIASES IN

00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:01.813
GENERAL BUT WE- WHAT WE TRY TO

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.716
DO IS TO ACTUALLY ASK HIM TO

00:23:04.783 --> 00:23:05.984
TELL US WHETHER OR NOT THE

00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:08.487
SCHISMS CREATE BIASES. AND HOW

00:23:08.553 --> 00:23:10.689
WE SHOULD ALSO ARE YOU KNOW

00:23:10.756 --> 00:23:12.257
ANALYZE IT FROM THE STATE

00:23:12.324 --> 00:23:13.892
AGENCY'S PERSPECTIVE FOR

00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:15.994
EXAMPLE IF A STATE AGENCY WANTS

00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:17.963
TO PROCURE A SYSTEM THAT WILL

00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:19.965
PUT TEN. POTENTIALLY IMPACT

00:23:20.031 --> 00:23:21.833
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DON'T YOU

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.568
WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOUR PRODUCT

00:23:23.635 --> 00:23:25.103
ALL THE PRODUCTS ARE AND WHAT

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:26.972
THEY CAN AND CANNOT DO IN ORDER

00:23:27.038 --> 00:23:28.473
NOT TO CREATE BIASES AND

00:23:28.540 --> 00:23:30.475
DISCRIMINATION ON YOUR P. O. ON

00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:32.611
ON THE GENERAL POPULATION. AND

00:23:32.677 --> 00:23:37.816
EXAMPLES. THAT I GAVE EARLIER

00:23:37.883 --> 00:23:39.050
FOR EXAMPLE TO MICHIGAN SENERE.

00:23:39.117 --> 00:23:41.086
WERE HE ARE UNDER THE AGE OF

00:23:41.153 --> 00:23:43.121
SYSEM. FOR THOUSAND PEOPLE. US

00:23:43.188 --> 00:23:45.423
BENEFITS B. TWO B. ALL IMPACTED

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:48.293
NEGATIVELY AN- ACCOUNT. WHAT

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.929
RESULTED WAR S. ACE WHO YOUR

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:54.366
SERIES OF LAWSUITS AND- THAT

00:23:54.432 --> 00:23:55.467
YOU KNOW WERE BROUGHT AGAINST

00:23:55.534 --> 00:23:56.802
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE

00:23:56.868 --> 00:23:58.570
GOVERNMENT ENDED UP HAVING TO

00:23:58.637 --> 00:24:00.806
PAY A LOT MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:01.706
TO BASICALLY SETTLE THESE

00:24:01.773 --> 00:24:03.275
LAWSUITS SO THAT'S ONLY ONE

00:24:03.341 --> 00:24:04.976
EXAMPLE OF THE FOUR EXAMPLES

00:24:05.043 --> 00:24:06.878
SO. SO I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK

00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:09.381
AT THE YOU KNOW THE COST FACTOR

00:24:09.447 --> 00:24:10.782
YOU'RE NOT JUST LOOKING AT THE

00:24:10.849 --> 00:24:12.250
YOU KNOW THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT

00:24:12.317 --> 00:24:13.952
DID PREPARE IS IN AND- AND THE

00:24:14.019 --> 00:24:15.187
DOLLAR AMOUNT WE NEED TO LOOK

00:24:15.253 --> 00:24:18.590
AT THE LONG. RANGE THE RISKS

00:24:18.657 --> 00:24:19.391
INVOLVED ALSO. I HOPE THAT YOUR

00:24:19.457 --> 00:24:25.363
QUESTION. WELL YOU YOU

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:26.731
CERTAINLY PROVIDED SOME USEFUL

00:24:26.798 --> 00:24:28.333
INFORMATION I DO APPRECIATE

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.668
THAT ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW THAT

00:24:29.734 --> 00:24:31.803
WE PUT A FINER POINT ON THE

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.839
ISSUE OF IT BEING COST

00:24:33.905 --> 00:24:35.273
PROHIBITIVE TO SOME OF THE

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:36.875
SMALLER BETTER KNOWN TO

00:24:36.942 --> 00:24:39.811
MINORITY BUSINESSES BUT- BUT I

00:24:39.878 --> 00:24:42.280
APPRECIATE- YOUR RESPONSE TO

00:24:42.347 --> 00:24:45.684
SOME WOMEN THANK YOU. ANY OTHER

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.919
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM

00:24:47.986 --> 00:24:51.489
MEMBERS. THE SENATOR FROM

00:24:51.556 --> 00:24:54.159
LAGER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR-

00:24:54.226 --> 00:24:55.327
AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER

00:24:55.393 --> 00:24:56.995
FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I TOO

00:24:57.062 --> 00:24:58.897
HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND

00:24:58.964 --> 00:24:59.464
I CAME IN LATE FROM ANOTHER

00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:03.268
HEARING SO- I MAY HAVE MISSED.

00:25:03.335 --> 00:25:05.437
SOME OF THIS BUT THE AMENDMENTS

00:25:05.503 --> 00:25:07.072
THAT WERE TAKEN MY

00:25:07.138 --> 00:25:09.307
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. DO THAT

00:25:09.374 --> 00:25:11.109
AND AMENDMENTS AMENDMENTS

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:13.945
MANDATE THE IMPACT ASSESSMENT

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:18.116
OR JUST ASK FOR I. WASN'T CLEAR

00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:20.685
IF IT REQUIRES IT OR NOT I KNOW

00:25:20.752 --> 00:25:22.387
WELL WITH THE AMENDMENTS THE

00:25:22.454 --> 00:25:24.890
VENDORS ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO

00:25:24.956 --> 00:25:26.791
PROVIDE THESE REPORTS THEY ARE

00:25:26.858 --> 00:25:29.194
ENCOURAGED TO PROVIDE THEM ONTO

00:25:29.261 --> 00:25:31.229
THE STATE AGENCIES ACCORDINGLY.

00:25:31.296 --> 00:25:33.098
SO WHAT WHAT END UP HAPPENING

00:25:33.164 --> 00:25:35.233
IS THAT STATE AGENCIES OR STATE

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.502
CDT IN PARTICULAR WILL COME UP

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:39.905
WITH GUIDELINES AND ABOUT THESE

00:25:39.971 --> 00:25:42.240
ATS SYSTEMS FOR VENDORS TO

00:25:42.307 --> 00:25:43.708
COMPLY WITH AND THEY WILL ALSO

00:25:43.775 --> 00:25:45.610
COME UP WITH A SAMPLE FORM IF

00:25:45.677 --> 00:25:47.545
THEY SO DESIRE TO SUBMIT THESE

00:25:47.612 --> 00:25:50.415
IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORT. SO

00:25:50.482 --> 00:25:52.350
ESSENTIALLY THEY ARE THEY ARE-

00:25:52.417 --> 00:25:55.053
THESE ARE VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE-

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.554
AS OPPOSED TO THE ORIGINAL

00:25:56.621 --> 00:25:59.724
VERSION OF THE BILL WHICH

00:25:59.791 --> 00:26:00.892
MANDATED COMPLIANCE. RIGHT SO

00:26:00.959 --> 00:26:04.262
IF. THEY DON'T COMPLY AND

00:26:04.329 --> 00:26:06.531
DECIDE NOT TO USE THE

00:26:06.598 --> 00:26:09.901
GUIDELINES. THEN WHAT HAPPENS

00:26:09.968 --> 00:26:11.002
THE THING I DON'T UNDERSTAND

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:14.105
YOUR THE GOAL IS TO HELP

00:26:14.172 --> 00:26:17.509
IDENTIFY. MAYBE THE BIAS SEES

00:26:17.575 --> 00:26:20.211
IN THESE AI SYSTEMS BUT IF YOU

00:26:20.278 --> 00:26:22.347
HAVE ANDERS AND DECIDED NOT TO

00:26:22.414 --> 00:26:24.416
COMPLY BECAUSE IT'S NOT

00:26:24.482 --> 00:26:26.885
MANDATORY FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT

00:26:26.952 --> 00:26:28.453
THEN WHAT HAPPENS TO THE

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.122
OUTCOME OF NOTHING HAPPENS TO

00:26:31.189 --> 00:26:32.891
THE OUTCOME- WE SIMPLY

00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:36.094
ENCOURAGING A DC YOU KNOW STATE

00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:38.863
AGENCIES TO- TO LOST AND

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.799
CREATING THE VENDORS TO. TO

00:26:40.865 --> 00:26:42.434
PROVIDE THESE REPORTS TO THE

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.103
STATE AGENCIES WHEN THEY ARE.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:47.038
ON A PARTICULAR CONTRACT OUT

00:26:47.105 --> 00:26:49.040
FOR EXAMPLE TWO HERE'S ANOTHER

00:26:49.107 --> 00:26:51.209
OPPONENT THERE'S ANOTHER PIECE

00:26:51.276 --> 00:26:52.644
TO THE AMENDMENT THAT IS THE

00:26:52.711 --> 00:26:54.646
INVENTORY PEAS SO UNDER THE

00:26:54.713 --> 00:26:57.716
AMENDMENTS OF C. T. IS SUPPOSED

00:26:57.782 --> 00:26:59.084
TO COME UP WITH A COMPREHENSIVE

00:26:59.150 --> 00:27:01.786
INVENTORY OF ALL THESE VIDEO

00:27:01.853 --> 00:27:03.788
SYSTEMS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE

00:27:03.855 --> 00:27:06.324
OR INTEND TO PURCHASE I'M SO

00:27:06.391 --> 00:27:07.325
THAT WAY WE HAVE A BETTER

00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:09.027
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT. THE

00:27:09.094 --> 00:27:14.099
UNIVERSE IS OUT THERE. ON SO

00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:14.632
THAT WE COULD TAKE ACTION

00:27:14.699 --> 00:27:15.266
ACCORDINGLY. OKAY THANK YOU AND

00:27:15.333 --> 00:27:18.370
THEN- YOU KNOW I'M GLAD THAT

00:27:18.436 --> 00:27:19.671
ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO

00:27:19.738 --> 00:27:21.873
TESTIFIED- I GUESS ONE OF THE

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:25.243
SUPPORTERS MENTIONED APPROX

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.877
TWENTY FIVE AND THERE WAS A LOT

00:27:25.944 --> 00:27:28.480
OF DISCUSSION AROUND. THAT

00:27:28.546 --> 00:27:30.415
PARTICULAR PROPOSITION BECAUSE

00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:32.684
OF THE RISK ASSESSMENT TOOLS

00:27:32.751 --> 00:27:35.487
AND- THE ALGORITHMS THAT ARE

00:27:35.553 --> 00:27:39.257
USED IN THOSE ASSESSMENTS. AND

00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:42.227
THE POINT WHICH I THINK- MIGHT

00:27:42.293 --> 00:27:43.695
HAVE BEEN RAISED EARLIER AND I

00:27:43.762 --> 00:27:44.262
CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN THINKING

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:48.733
ABOUT. IS THAT- YOU KNOW

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:54.339
ALGORITHMS ARE. FROM A PURELY

00:27:54.406 --> 00:28:00.445
ANALYTICAL- SPACE ARE UNBIASED

00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:02.480
BUT IT'S THE CODERS WHO ARE

00:28:02.547 --> 00:28:05.517
CREATING THE ALGORITHMS THAT

00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:06.918
INTEGRATE THE BIAS OF THE

00:28:06.985 --> 00:28:09.821
PREJUDICE INTO THE ALGORITHMS

00:28:09.888 --> 00:28:11.523
THAT ARE THEN USED AND THEN YOU

00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:15.326
KNOW PURCHASED BY GOVERNMENTS

00:28:15.393 --> 00:28:18.096
PEOPLE CONSUMERS X. CETERA. AND

00:28:18.163 --> 00:28:21.933
HOW DOES THIS GET BACK THAT AND

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.635
THE REASON WHY I ASK BECAUSE

00:28:23.701 --> 00:28:24.736
ACTUALLY BECAUSE THERE WAS AN

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:25.937
ARTICLE THAT JUST CAME OUT THIS

00:28:26.004 --> 00:28:27.972
MORNING THAT WAS TALKING ABOUT

00:28:28.039 --> 00:28:29.574
THE TECH INDUSTRY AND A

00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:31.076
KNOWLEDGE AND HOW INCREDIBLY

00:28:31.142 --> 00:28:34.746
HOMOGENOUS- THE INDUSTRY IS

00:28:34.813 --> 00:28:37.115
LESS THAN 1% OF FOLKS WHO ARE

00:28:37.182 --> 00:28:38.850
CODING. ARE IN FACT AFRICAN

00:28:38.917 --> 00:28:40.852
AMERICAN AND SO IF WE ARE

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:42.153
TALKING ABOUT HOW TO CREATE

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:44.155
EQUITY IN THESE KINDS OF A. I.

00:28:44.222 --> 00:28:45.590
SYSTEMS THAT THEN WE ARE

00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:46.324
BECOMING MORE AND MORE

00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:48.359
DEPENDENT UPON DOESN'T MAKE

00:28:48.426 --> 00:28:49.594
SENSE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY

THAT I THINK WE ALL RECEIVE

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.462
SOME LEVEL OF CRITICISM IS THAT

00:34:57.528 --> 00:34:58.429
WE'RE NOT EFFICIENT IN WHAT WE

00:34:58.496 --> 00:34:59.931

00:34:59.997 --> 00:35:01.532
TAXPAYERS MONEY AS EFFICIENTLY

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.734

THAT. IN IN THE AREA OF I. T.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.088

00:35:29.427 --> 00:35:31.562
THAT CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM-

00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:33.097

COLONIZATION OF THIS WHOLE AREA

02:14:06.471 --> 02:14:09.408

REALLY ALL OVER THE WORLD OF

02:21:22.473 --> 02:21:27.245
DIFFERENT FAITHS RELIGIONS AND-

02:21:27.312 --> 02:21:29.080
AS MANY OTHER CALIFORNIANS I

02:21:29.147 --> 02:21:32.016
HAVE. I SHARE BLOOD WITH MANY

02:21:32.083 --> 02:21:32.884

02:21:32.951 --> 02:21:35.320
AMERICAN. I AM OF SPANISH

02:21:35.386 --> 02:21:38.256
ITALIAN EVEN NASH FOR **** JEW.

02:21:45.463 --> 02:21:47.632
HISTORY IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN

02:21:47.699 --> 02:21:49.067
TOLD IN CORRECTLY. IT'S BEEN

02:21:49.133 --> 02:21:50.969
TOLD BY INDIVIDUALS THAT CAME

02:21:51.035 --> 02:21:52.604
TO DOMINATE THE POLITICAL POWER

02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:54.405
OF THE STATE IN THE COUNTRY

02:21:54.472 --> 02:21:57.308

02:22:04.949 --> 02:22:06.918
SHOULD CHANGE THAT. THIS BILL

02:22:06.985 --> 02:22:08.286
ELIMINATES A REQUIREMENT TO

THE SUCCESSES OF OUR HISTORY

02:22:55.700 --> 02:22:57.302

JUST LIKE ANY OTHER. A PORTENT

02:23:43.381 --> 02:23:45.049
HISTORICAL FIGURE I THINK HE

02:23:45.116 --> 02:23:47.118
WAS IMPORTANT IN HIS TIME. HERE

02:23:47.185 --> 02:23:49.754
IN THE STATE HE ACTUALLY WALKED

02:23:49.821 --> 02:23:51.789
BACKED TO MEXICO FROM MODERATE

02:23:51.856 --> 02:23:54.592

NATIVE AMERICAN BILL OF RIGHTS

02:23:57.996 --> 02:23:59.998
BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR AT THAT

02:24:00.064 --> 02:24:01.899
THAT THAT THEN GOVERNOR OF

CALIFORNIA WAS ACTUALLY.

02:24:04.268 --> 02:24:05.503
HORRIFICALLY ABUSING OF NATIVE

02:24:05.570 --> 02:24:07.271
AMERICANS AND HE OPPOSED TO IT

02:24:07.338 --> 02:24:08.206
HE BROUGHT IT UP WITH THE

02:24:08.272 --> 02:24:09.240
GOVERNOR AND THE GOVERNOR DID

02:24:09.307 --> 02:24:11.242
NOTHING TO CONTROL. THE

02:24:11.309 --> 02:24:13.344
GARRISONS OF TROOPS ORDER WITH-

02:24:13.411 --> 02:24:15.580

GOVERNOR WAS ACTUALLY REMOVED

02:24:23.187 --> 02:24:24.589
