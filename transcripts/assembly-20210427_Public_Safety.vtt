SOMETHING THAT THEIR ATTORNEY

00:40:38.335 --> 00:40:40.504
WOULD. I THINK IS PART OF THE

00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:41.772
PROCESS THERE YOUR ATTORNEY

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:43.908

WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM IN THE

00:40:49.547 --> 00:40:51.782
FIRST PLACE AND GOT THEM THERE-

00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:54.118
IS THE DETECTIVE CONCURRENT TO

00:40:57.021 --> 00:40:58.422
THE PROCESS THAT THEY GO

00:40:58.489 --> 00:41:00.457
THROUGH TO MAKE THAT RIGHT THAT

00:41:00.524 --> 00:41:02.293
WRONG RIGHT AGAIN NOT NECESSARY

00:41:02.359 --> 00:41:04.128
RIGHT. TO SHOW THAT THEY'VE

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:07.231
GONE PAST IT. AND IN AND THAT'S

00:41:07.298 --> 00:41:08.899
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS.

00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:09.800
PEOPLE NEED TO BE HELD

00:41:09.867 --> 00:41:11.869
ACCOUNTABLE AND NINETY AND IF

00:41:11.936 --> 00:41:12.670
THEY'RE PUTTING IN IT

00:41:12.736 --> 00:41:14.271
THEMSELVES IN A POSITION WHERE

00:41:14.338 --> 00:41:14.839
THEY HAVE TO HAVE A RECORD

00:41:14.905 --> 00:41:17.541

00:41:17.608 --> 00:41:20.411
AND- AND GO THROUGH THE PROCESS

00:41:20.477 --> 00:41:21.412
SO THEY REMEMBER NEXT TIME

THAT. WHY THERE'S A HECK OF A

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:24.849
PROCESS TO GO THROUGH IF I WANT

00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:26.617

00:41:26.684 --> 00:41:27.952
NOTHING INHERENTLY THAT

00:41:28.018 --> 00:41:29.253

00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:31.728
ACCESS TO AN ATTORNEY IS

00:55:31.795 --> 00:55:33.830
FUNDAMENTAL ONE OF OUR CONCERNS

00:55:33.897 --> 00:55:36.099
IS THAT IN VALUE EIGHTY QUEST

00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:37.567

WHICH MAY ONLY BE OVERCOME IF

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:48.845
THE COURT FINDS THAT THE

00:55:48.912 --> 00:55:51.247
DEFENDANT POSES AN UNREASONABLE

00:55:51.314 --> 00:55:53.049
RISK PUBLIC EIGHT FEET BECAUSE

CRIMINAL CONDUCT IN EVALUATING

00:56:11.668 --> 00:56:13.770
SUITABILITY FOR RESENTENCING IS

00:56:13.837 --> 00:56:15.572
FANCIFUL AT WORST AND

00:56:15.638 --> 00:56:17.741
UNWORKABLE IT BASS MOREOVER

00:56:17.807 --> 00:56:19.576
THIS PRODUCTION IS UNNECESSARY

00:56:19.642 --> 00:56:21.511
UNDER CURRENT LAW AND THE

00:56:21.578 --> 00:56:22.979
PROPOSED BILL JUDGES HAVE

00:56:23.046 --> 00:56:24.748
DISCRETION TO CONSIDER JUDICIAL

00:56:24.814 --> 00:56:26.716
COUNCIL RULES AND THE JUDGE

SENTENCING AND CONFORMITY WITH

00:56:31.821 --> 00:56:33.723
CHANGES IN SENTENCING LAW. OUR

00:56:33.790 --> 00:56:35.325
OTHER MAIN CONCERNS THAT THE

00:56:35.391 --> 00:56:36.793
BILL ALLOWS THE COURT TO

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:39.262
LITERALLY CHANGE THE CHARGES

00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:40.630
FOR WHICH A PERSON WAS TRIED

00:56:40.697 --> 00:56:42.198
AND CONVICTED IN ORDER TO

00:56:42.265 --> 00:56:44.300
REDUCE SENTENCES IT WOULD ALLOW

00:56:44.367 --> 00:56:45.935
THE COURT TO VACATE A

00:56:46.002 --> 00:56:48.104
CONVICTION AND IMPOSED JUDGMENT

00:56:54.377 --> 00:56:55.812
WOULD CONTRAVENE THE DA'S

00:56:55.879 --> 00:56:57.714
CHARGING DECISION AND THE

00:56:57.781 --> 00:56:59.115
JURY'S VERDICT AND IS VERY

00:56:59.182 --> 00:57:00.884
LIKELY AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:03.286
INTRUSION INTO EXECUTIVE BRANCH

00:57:03.353 --> 00:57:08.725

00:57:13.296 --> 00:57:14.164
SIGNIFICANTLY AS WELL THERE'S

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:15.598

PROSECUTORS AND JURIES AND

00:57:38.288 --> 00:57:40.023

AND THE WAY THE DA'S DESCRIBED

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:47.543
IT- I THINK THAT YOUR BILL DOES

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:50.279
ALLOW FLEXIBILITY FOR THE JUDGE

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:51.547
TO CONSIDER ALL SORTS OF

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:57.453
MEAN IT GOES FROM A LIFE

01:11:45.801 --> 01:11:47.236
OF PEOPLE WHO COACH OUR KIDS IN

01:11:47.302 --> 01:11:48.737
OUR IN OUR KIDS LIVES ARE

01:11:48.804 --> 01:11:50.606
VOLUNTEERS- AND THEY DO NOT A

01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:52.007
GOOD AS THEIR HEART BUT HAVING

01:11:52.074 --> 01:11:53.175
THOSE PEOPLE INCLUDED IS

01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:54.643
ACTUALLY REALLY IMPORTANT I

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:55.477
KNOW THERE WAS SOME QUESTION

01:11:55.544 --> 01:11:57.212
ABOUT THE OVER BREADTH OF THIS

01:11:57.279 --> 01:11:58.347
OBVIOUSLY THOSE PEOPLE IT MAKES

01:11:58.414 --> 01:12:01.650
SENSE YOU KNOW. BUT AB IS THERE

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:03.452
A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:04.420
REALLY FOCUSING ON THOSE

01:12:04.486 --> 01:12:06.455
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SERVING IN

01:12:06.522 --> 01:12:07.056
FUNCTIONS THAT ACTUALLY

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:09.458
TRADITIONALLY ARE ARE MANDATED

01:12:09.525 --> 01:12:10.225
REPORTERS RATHER THAN THE

01:12:10.292 --> 01:12:13.195
PERSON WORKS AT THE SNACK SHACK

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:16.732
AT THE- SOCCER GAME HE WELL-

01:12:16.799 --> 01:12:18.567
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I IT'S

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:21.003
UNFORTUNATE THE EXAMPLE YOU

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:23.305
USED BECAUSE THAT MIGHT NOT FOR

01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:24.339
I MEAN THAT STILL MAY BE A

01:12:24.406 --> 01:12:26.075
MANDATORY REPORTER IN CERTAIN

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:28.711
CIRCUMSTANCES- SO I DON'T WANT

01:12:28.777 --> 01:12:29.945
TO SUGGEST THAT I'M SPEAKING TO

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:32.047
THAT EXACT EXAMPLE WE DO NEED

01:12:32.114 --> 01:12:33.282
TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

01:12:33.348 --> 01:12:36.719
PTA IN PARTICULAR- ABOUT- IT'S

01:12:36.785 --> 01:12:38.721
NOT WE FOCUSED ON THE HOURS

01:12:38.787 --> 01:12:39.922
THAT A VOLUNTEER SERVES IN

01:12:39.988 --> 01:12:41.924
ORDER TO NOT BE OVERBROAD. BUT

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.991
THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT

01:12:43.058 --> 01:12:45.127
ARE TRADITIONALLY USED SERVING

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:47.262
THAT DON'T ACTUALLY- COME INTO

01:12:47.329 --> 01:12:48.597
PLAY WITH THE U. S. WHICH IS

01:12:48.664 --> 01:12:49.665
KIND OF BIZARRE SO WE WILL

01:12:49.732 --> 01:12:51.233
TIGHTEN UP THAT AND ENSURE THAT

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:53.535
WE- NARROW THE SCOPE IN THAT

01:12:53.602 --> 01:12:54.737
SENSE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:12:54.803 --> 01:12:56.405
ENSURE THOUGH IS THERE ARE

01:12:56.472 --> 01:12:58.240
SITUATIONS IN IN THE SNAPSHOT

01:12:58.307 --> 01:13:00.476
MAY BE AN EXAMPLE WHERE YOU

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:01.677
DON'T REALLY THINK OF THEM AS

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:02.911
YOU SERVING OF BUT PERHAPS

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:04.880
THERE'S KIDS WHO ARE HELPING IN

01:13:04.947 --> 01:13:07.049
THE SNAPSHOT AND SO- IT I'M

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:08.283
THINKING MY KIDS BASEBALL GAME

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:11.754
RIGHT THE PARENT DOESN'T DO THE

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.288
TIME. AND THIS TAX. ANYONE HAS

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:14.456
AND LITTLE LEAGUE UNDERSTAND

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:15.324
THE TIME THAT YOU HAVE TO

01:13:15.390 --> 01:13:18.026
SERVE. THEM BUT MAYBE THE KID

01:13:18.093 --> 01:13:20.129
DOES AN OLDER KID AND WHAT WE

01:13:20.195 --> 01:13:21.029
WANT TO PREVENT IS WHEN THEY

01:13:21.096 --> 01:13:22.264
HAVE THAT ONE ON ONE CONTACT

01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:24.099
WITH OUT OTHER SUPERVISION IF

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:25.567
IT'S FOR PROLONGED. AMOUNTS OF

01:13:25.634 --> 01:13:27.169
TIMES THAT THEY ARE NUMBER ONE

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:28.504
TRAINED AS MANDATORY REPORTERS

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:29.605
AND BACKGROUND CHECKED I MEAN

01:13:29.671 --> 01:13:31.073
THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS SOUTH.

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.642
YES WE ARE GOING TO ENSURE-

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:35.010
THAT IT'S NARROW ENOUGH THAT

01:13:35.077 --> 01:13:36.845
WE'RE NOT INCLUDING. SOMEBODY

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:38.046
WHO SHOWS UP TO THE PTA BAKE

01:13:38.113 --> 01:13:40.048
SALE- IN IS NOT INTERACTING

01:13:40.115 --> 01:13:41.617
WITH THE CHILD ON THEIR OWN BUT

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:42.951
NOT QUITE YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT TO

01:13:43.018 --> 01:13:44.119
BE CAREFUL IN HOW WE DO IT. FOR

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:47.089
PATIENTS AND I REPORTS WARNING

01:13:47.156 --> 01:13:48.323

SUPPORT REALLY BAD BECAUSE IT

01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:57.299
INVOLVES CHILD ABUSE AND ONE OF

01:13:57.366 --> 01:14:00.936
THE QUESTIONS I HAVE FOR YOU IS.

01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:02.271
YOU KNOW WHAT IS WHAT WOULD BE

01:14:02.337 --> 01:14:04.473
THE MINIMUM AGE CONSIDERED TO

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:05.741
BE A VOLUNTEER THAT WOULD FALL

01:14:05.808 --> 01:14:08.577
UNDER THIS IS EIGHTEEN

01:14:08.644 --> 01:14:09.178
EIGHTEEN. YEAH BECAUSE I THINK

01:14:09.244 --> 01:14:10.412
OF PLACES LIKE THE BOYS AND

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:11.780
GIRLS CLUB AND I THINK OF YOU

01:14:11.847 --> 01:14:13.282

01:14:13.348 --> 01:14:15.617
WHERE THEY DO. HAVE A LOT OF-

01:14:15.684 --> 01:14:19.454
YOUNG VOLUNTEERS THEY'RE

01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:20.055
EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE OR- IN

EQUIPPED THEY ARE. TO RECOGNIZE

01:14:26.061 --> 01:14:28.397
AND UNDERSTAND WHEN SOMETHING

01:14:28.463 --> 01:14:30.799
IS WRONG SO THEY GET THIS

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:32.234
TRAINING WHICH CONSISTS OF HOW

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:35.504
MANY HOURS. I BELIEVE IT'S FOR

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:36.839

HAVE A HARD TIME FIGURING OUT

01:14:50.652 --> 01:14:52.788
WHAT IS AND WHAT ISN'T. ONE OF

01:14:52.855 --> 01:14:54.690
MY CONCERNS IS THE LIABILITY

01:15:25.053 --> 01:15:26.455
WORDS THEY MISINTERPRET SOME OF

01:15:26.521 --> 01:15:28.056
THE CLUES THAT THEY MAY BE

01:15:28.123 --> 01:15:29.591
TAUGHT YOU KNOW ACCEPT BRUISES.

01:15:29.658 --> 01:15:31.159
THINGS LIKE THAT I WAS A

01:15:31.226 --> 01:15:32.794
MANDATORY REPORTER MYSELF

01:15:32.861 --> 01:15:35.597
OBVIOUSLY AND- WE HAD TO

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:37.032
STRUGGLE WITH THAT SOMETIMES WE

01:15:37.099 --> 01:15:39.434
GO IN THE HOUSE AND WE LOOK

01:15:39.501 --> 01:15:41.670

PARENTS LIFE INTO HELL FORMER.

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:48.343
WHAT WE THINK IS AN ABUSE

01:15:48.410 --> 01:15:51.113
SITUATION. I CAN'T IMAGINE

01:15:51.179 --> 01:15:52.848
PLACE IN THAT ON A YOUNG

01:15:52.915 --> 01:15:56.218
VOLUNTEER SO I WAS HOPING THAT

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:58.887
WE COULD SOMEHOW HAVE THIS BE A

01:15:58.954 --> 01:16:01.356
BILL WHERE THOSE VOLUNTEERS ARE

01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:02.925
GIVEN THE TRAINING THE BASIC

01:16:02.991 --> 01:16:05.928
TRAINING. AND THE ORGANIZATION

01:16:05.994 --> 01:16:07.863
NEEDS TO HAVE THOSE VOLUNTEERS

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:09.965
REPORT TO A MANDATORY REPORTER

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:12.334
IN THAT SYSTEM THAT HEY I

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:14.369
SUSPECT THIS SO THAT THAT

01:16:14.436 --> 01:16:16.638
MANDATORY REPORTING IS ACTUALLY

01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:20.208
DONE BY. AT IT'S AN ADULT THAT

01:16:20.275 --> 01:16:22.344
IS PAID THAT I MEAN THAT'S WHAT

01:16:22.411 --> 01:16:25.914
I WAS PAID FOR TO DO THAT. AND

01:16:25.981 --> 01:16:28.050
THEREFORE PROTECTING THESE

01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:30.585
YOUNG PEOPLE FROM THOUGH NOT

01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:33.155
ONLY POTENTIAL LIABILITY BUT I

01:16:33.221 --> 01:16:35.223
I'VE SEEN A FEW OF THESE ANGRY

01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:38.327
PARENTS. WHO COME AND SAY HEY

01:16:38.393 --> 01:16:39.695

NEXT THING YOU KNOW I GOT CPS.

01:16:43.598 --> 01:16:45.233
COME BRING THEM DOWN MY THROAT

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.302
I CAN'T GET MY KIDS BACK. IT'S

01:16:47.369 --> 01:16:49.271
A NIGHTMARE FOR SOME PEOPLE AND

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:52.307
WE WANT TO PROTECT THOSE KIDS

01:16:52.374 --> 01:16:55.010
THAT'S THE TRADE OFF. BUT I

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:56.745
SOMEHOW WANT C. THAT

01:16:56.812 --> 01:16:59.181
TRANSFERRED TO THE PEOPLE THAT

01:16:59.247 --> 01:16:59.715
ARE ACTUALLY THE ADULTS IN

01:16:59.781 --> 01:17:01.817
CHARGE. SO THIS THAT'S JUST MY

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:03.719
STRUGGLE WITH IT SURE HAVING A

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:05.320
HARD TIME NOT SUPPORTING AND

01:17:05.387 --> 01:17:06.521
BACKING AND NOT I'M NOT GONNA

01:17:06.588 --> 01:17:08.790
BONDS I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT

01:17:08.857 --> 01:17:10.659
THIS IS A RESULT OF IN FACT THE

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:12.294
BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB AND THE BOY

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:13.528
SCOUTS. IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:17:13.595 --> 01:17:15.664
WHITE BOY SCOUT NINETY THOUSAND

01:17:15.731 --> 01:17:18.066
CASES PRIMARILY BY VOLUNTEERS

01:17:18.133 --> 01:17:19.034
OF ABUSE AND NO REPORTING

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:21.203
WHATSOEVER BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB-

01:17:21.269 --> 01:17:22.304
THERE WERE OVER TWO HUNDRED

01:17:22.371 --> 01:17:23.472
CASES AND THEY FOUND THAT

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:25.240
DESPITE INTERNAL POLICIES THEY

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:26.341
WERE DOING BACKGROUND CHECKS ON

01:17:26.408 --> 01:17:28.076
THEIR END OWN EMPLOYEES. SO

01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:31.713
THIS IS SET IN FACT TO NOT HAVE

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:33.415
THE VOTE THE LONG TERM

01:17:33.482 --> 01:17:34.616
VOLUNTEERS BECAUSE THIS IS NOT

01:17:34.683 --> 01:17:37.085
A CASUAL VOLUNTEER RATES

01:17:37.152 --> 01:17:38.220
SIXTEEN HOURS IN A MONTH OR

01:17:38.286 --> 01:17:39.421
THIRTY TWO FOR THE YEAR A LONG

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:40.756
TERM VOLUNTEERS TO TRULY

01:17:40.822 --> 01:17:42.324
UNDERSTAND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:44.593
AS WELL UNFORTUNATELY IF WE HAD

01:17:44.659 --> 01:17:47.529
LET THE LAW. JUST ALLOW- USEFUL

01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:48.597
IT'S NOT USEFUL IN TEARS

01:17:48.663 --> 01:17:50.599
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE OVER

01:17:50.665 --> 01:17:51.166
EIGHTEEN BECAUSE IT DOES GET

01:17:51.233 --> 01:17:53.668
TRICKY UNDER EIGHTEEN BUT OVER

01:17:53.735 --> 01:17:54.636
EIGHTEEN TO SIMPLY TELL-

01:17:54.703 --> 01:17:56.671
SOMEBODY AT THE INSTITUTION

01:17:56.738 --> 01:17:58.373
THAT THAT MIGHT BE THAT IN ALL

01:17:58.440 --> 01:17:59.541
OF THESE CASES IT WAS SOMEBODY

01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:01.643
AT THE INSTITUTION ITSELF THAT

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:03.178
WAS WAS PERPETRATING THE ABUSE.

01:18:03.245 --> 01:18:04.513
AND THIS IS REALLY GEARED

01:18:04.579 --> 01:18:06.515
TOWARDS CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE

01:18:06.581 --> 01:18:08.250
IN INSTITUTIONS THAT SERVE

01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:10.452
CHILDREN- SO I UNDERSTAND YOUR

01:18:10.519 --> 01:18:12.320
CONCERNS AT AN EIGHTEEN YEAR

01:18:12.387 --> 01:18:13.789
OLD THAT CALLS- THAT THAT

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:15.323
REPORTS TO BE A LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:18:15.390 --> 01:18:18.226
ISN'T SUBJECT TO LIABILITY I IN

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:19.161
AND IT'S NOT IN THEIR HANDS

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:21.063
WHETHER OR NOT. THE LAN PORTS

01:18:21.129 --> 01:18:22.497
AND HAS TO DEAL WITH CPS IN THE

01:18:22.564 --> 01:18:24.599
RESULT OF C. P. S. U. YOU WERE

01:18:24.666 --> 01:18:26.268
PROBABLY IN A DIFFERENT SPOT

01:18:26.334 --> 01:18:28.804
SO- I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THAT I

01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:30.505
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH UNDER

01:18:30.572 --> 01:18:31.206
EIGHTEEN FOR VARIETY REASONS

01:18:31.273 --> 01:18:32.007
I'M NOT SURE THAT THE

01:18:32.074 --> 01:18:34.076
COMPREHENSION- WOULD BE

01:18:34.142 --> 01:18:35.677
COMPLETE. AND SO IN FOR THE

01:18:35.744 --> 01:18:37.379

PROPERTY CONFISCATION AND

01:37:43.424 --> 01:37:44.925
THINGS LIKE THAT CREATE A

01:37:44.992 --> 01:37:47.094
CONFLICT OF INTEREST SO THAT IS

01:37:47.161 --> 01:37:49.029
PART OF THIS BILL- IT THAT

01:37:49.096 --> 01:37:50.764
CREATES I THINK THAT SAME KIND

01:37:50.831 --> 01:37:51.632
OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:53.334

01:38:02.376 --> 01:38:05.112
AN INTENTION OKAY IN THE BILL.

01:38:05.179 --> 01:38:06.180
I THINK THAT'S FOR A CONFLICT

01:38:06.247 --> 01:38:07.648
OF INTEREST AS A IS A RIGHT

01:38:07.715 --> 01:38:11.018
ISSUE TO RAISE. HI I ACTUALLY

01:38:11.085 --> 01:38:12.386

ASSOCIATION. AND- AS I SAY THIS

01:38:35.342 --> 01:38:36.944
PARTICULAR BILL GROWS OUT OF MY

01:38:37.011 --> 01:38:37.811
OWN INVOLVEMENT WITH AN

01:38:37.878 --> 01:38:40.714

THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT

01:39:33.334 --> 01:39:34.668
BUT THERE THERE'S SOME OTHER

01:39:34.735 --> 01:39:36.670
CONCERNS WERE WITH THE WAY THIS

01:39:36.737 --> 01:39:37.838
IS STRUCTURED AT LEAST MY

01:39:37.905 --> 01:39:39.973
UNDERSTANDING OF IT. ONE OF THE

01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:42.643
OF THE FRUSTRATIONS WAS

01:39:42.710 --> 01:39:44.345
EXPRESSED BY- MISTER SHARP

01:39:44.411 --> 01:39:46.547
THOUGH BUT- SECONDLY I THINK

01:39:46.613 --> 01:39:49.383
THAT IT CREATES THE PRESUMPTION

01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:52.419
THAT SAW. IT'S QUITE- UNFAIR

01:39:52.486 --> 01:39:53.787
THE REQUIREMENT FOR PROOF

01:39:53.854 --> 01:40:02.896
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. THAT

01:40:02.963 --> 01:40:04.298
THE DEFENDANT IS LIKELY TO OUT

01:40:04.365 --> 01:40:06.600
FOR. BY LIKE. I THINK THAT'S A-

01:40:06.667 --> 01:40:08.769
HUGE STEP IT'S FAIRLY REASON.

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:09.436
AND IT'S KIND OF A DEFECT ON

01:40:09.503 --> 01:40:12.906

YOU. YET I THINK THAT- TACKLING

01:56:04.157 --> 01:56:06.059
THE ISSUE OF HATE CRIMES. IS

01:56:06.125 --> 01:56:08.061
GOING TO REQUIRE A COMBINATION

01:56:08.127 --> 01:56:09.562
OF MANY DIFFERENT APPROACHES

01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:11.898
AND MANY SOLUTIONS. AND THIS IS

01:56:11.964 --> 01:56:14.067
ONLY ONE OF THOSE SOLUTIONS NOW

01:56:14.133 --> 01:56:16.536
OF COURSE. THIS BILL FOCUSES ON

01:56:16.602 --> 01:56:18.771
THE FINES AND ALSO THE TRAINING

01:56:18.838 --> 01:56:20.807
ASPECT OF IT HAS REACHED AS I

01:56:20.873 --> 01:56:22.108
STATED EARLIER. ALL THE

01:56:22.175 --> 01:56:24.844

CLASSES- AND THE LIGHT WHICH IS

01:56:28.815 --> 01:56:29.816
GOING TO BE VERY HOPEFUL

01:56:29.882 --> 01:56:31.584
BECAUSE EDUCATION IS A BIG

01:56:31.651 --> 01:56:33.586
PIECE OF. THE EQUATION. NOW

01:56:33.653 --> 01:56:34.520

THE ISSUE YES I UNDERSTAND YOUR

01:56:44.630 --> 01:56:47.500
CONCERN BUT- YET I THINK UP

01:56:47.567 --> 01:56:48.935
THERE ARE SITUATIONS WERE

01:56:49.001 --> 01:56:52.071
IMPOSING A FINE IS GOING TO

01:56:52.138 --> 01:56:53.639
SERVE AS A DETERRENT. A PURPOSE

01:56:53.706 --> 01:56:55.007
FOR SOME DEFENDANTS AT NUMBER

01:56:55.074 --> 01:56:57.009
ONE. NOW AS FAR AS THE AMOUNT

01:56:57.076 --> 01:56:58.978
OF THE FINE AND ALSO OF THE

01:56:59.045 --> 01:57:00.747
DEFENDANT'S ABILITY TO PAY I

01:57:00.813 --> 01:57:02.515
THINK WE HAVE SOME GUARDRAILS

01:57:02.582 --> 01:57:04.484
IN PLACE ALREADY. NUMBER ONE.

01:57:04.550 --> 01:57:05.918

01:57:05.985 --> 01:57:07.787
WHETHER HOW HOW MUCH ALL

01:57:07.854 --> 01:57:09.689
WEATHER HOW MUCH OR WHETHER

01:57:09.756 --> 01:57:11.324
THEY ACTUALLY WOULD IMPOSE THE

01:57:11.391 --> 01:57:13.693
FINES. AND IT IS ENTIRELY UP TO

01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:14.494
THE JUDGE TO MAKE THAT

01:57:14.560 --> 01:57:15.795
DECISION. NOW THERE ARE MANY

01:57:15.862 --> 01:57:17.597
COURTS IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE

01:57:17.663 --> 01:57:19.332
CURRENTLY LOOKING AT THE

01:57:19.399 --> 01:57:21.167
DEFENDANT'S ABILITY TO PAY

01:57:21.234 --> 01:57:23.603
BEFORE THE IMPOSED A FINE. AND

01:57:23.669 --> 01:57:25.405
IN FACT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME

01:57:25.471 --> 01:57:26.506
COURT IS LOOKING AT THIS VERY

01:57:26.572 --> 01:57:28.441
ISSUE. STILL THERE IS A

01:57:28.508 --> 01:57:30.309
POSSIBILITY THAT- THERE IS-

01:57:30.376 --> 01:57:31.878
GOING TO BE A REQUIREMENT ON

01:57:31.944 --> 01:57:33.012
ALL THE JUDGES TO LOOK AT

01:57:33.079 --> 01:57:34.447
WHETHER OR NOT THE DEFENDANT

01:57:34.514 --> 01:57:36.015
WOULD HAVE TO ABILITY TO PAY

01:57:36.082 --> 01:57:39.585

UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION HAS

01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:48.961
A PROVISION THAT WOULD PROHIBIT

01:57:49.028 --> 01:57:50.863
EXCESSIVE FINES ON DEFENDANTS

01:57:50.930 --> 01:57:52.432
PER SE SO THERE'S PLENTY OF

01:57:52.498 --> 01:57:53.966
GUARDRAILS. THAT OUGHT THAT

01:57:54.033 --> 01:57:56.302
WE'RE PLACING ON ON ON THE-

01:57:56.369 --> 01:58:00.239
THIS PARTICULAR PENALTY. OR

01:58:00.306 --> 01:58:00.740
THIS PARTICULAR FORM OF

01:58:00.807 --> 01:58:01.808

01:58:08.014 --> 01:58:11.584
FINE. SO JUST TO RECAP IT IS UP

TO THE JUDGE TO. OUR GRANT THE

01:58:15.655 --> 01:58:17.824
YOUR GOT ROSE ALREADY AROUND IT

JUST A SAVINGS GUARDRAILS HAVE

01:58:21.494 --> 01:58:25.965
NOT BEEN EFFECTIVE IN THE PAST.

01:58:26.032 --> 01:58:30.069
AND YET THIS IS A- SO THIS IS

01:58:30.136 --> 01:58:32.738
ONE OF THOSE SUBJECTS THAT IS

01:58:32.805 --> 01:58:34.373
REALLY DIFFICULT FOR SOCIETY TO

01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:36.509
DEAL WITH. AND ONE OF THE

01:58:36.576 --> 01:58:38.344
REASONS IS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T

01:58:38.411 --> 01:58:41.080
DEMAND THAT SOMEBODY FEEL A

01:58:41.147 --> 01:58:41.781
DIFFERENT WAY IF THAT'S HOW

01:58:41.848 --> 01:58:43.950
THEY FEEL. ALL YOU CAN DO IS

01:58:44.016 --> 01:58:46.219
TRY TO STE SOMETIMES ALL YOU

01:58:46.285 --> 01:58:46.786
CAN DO IS TRY TO STEER THEIR

01:58:46.853 --> 01:58:49.689
BEHAVIOR AWAY FROM ACTING OUT

01:58:49.755 --> 01:58:52.091
ON WHAT CAN BE AT YOU KNOW I'VE

01:58:52.158 --> 01:58:55.261
BEEN LIKE I HATE CRIME- ACTING

01:58:55.328 --> 01:58:58.564
OUT IN A MANNER THAT- THEY FEEL

01:58:58.631 --> 01:59:01.033
INSIDE. THAT MAYBE REASON

01:59:01.100 --> 01:59:04.504
TELLS- YOU KNOW EVEN I FEEL

01:59:04.570 --> 01:59:05.104
LIKE THAT I'M NOT GOING TO DO

01:59:05.171 --> 01:59:07.573
THAT. AND I THINK THOSE ARE THE

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:09.909
THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE. THAT THIS

01:59:09.976 --> 01:59:11.511
BILL AFFECTS THERE ARE SOME

01:59:11.577 --> 01:59:22.855
PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING. TO FEEL

01:59:22.922 --> 01:59:23.456
A DARN THING THEY'RE GONNA DO

01:59:23.523 --> 01:59:24.090
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO. BUT WHEN

01:59:24.156 --> 01:59:25.992
YOU SEE A SPIKE IN. HATE CRIMES

01:59:26.058 --> 01:59:27.426
GOING ON LIKE WE'RE- WE HAVE TO

01:59:27.493 --> 01:59:29.161
A- AND MONITOR FOR A LOT OF

01:59:29.228 --> 01:59:30.563
PEOPLE IS IT. MONITOR GIVES

01:59:30.630 --> 01:59:31.797
THEM THAT EXTRA THING TO THINK

01:59:31.864 --> 01:59:34.800
ABOUT. WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO

01:59:34.867 --> 01:59:37.236
ACT OUT ON THEIR ANGER OR THEIR

01:59:37.303 --> 01:59:39.238
HATE OR WHATEVER IT IS IT'S

01:59:39.305 --> 01:59:43.776
TRIGGERING THEM. AND SO I DON'T

01:59:43.843 --> 01:59:48.080
SEE THE MONETARY- ENHANCEMENT

01:59:48.147 --> 01:59:50.616
FOR THIS AS AS SOMETHING BAD I

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:52.285
SEE TO SOMETHING GOOD AND

01:59:52.351 --> 01:59:54.086
YOU'VE ALREADY STATED THE PARTS

01:59:54.153 --> 01:59:56.722
WHERE YOU KNOW THERE ARE THERE

01:59:56.789 --> 01:59:58.591
ARE GUARDRAILS THAT ALLOW

01:59:58.658 --> 02:00:00.226
SENTENCE SAM YOU CAN'T SQUEEZE

02:00:00.293 --> 02:00:01.761
BLOOD OUT OF A TURNIP. IF

02:00:01.827 --> 02:00:02.895
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE IF YOU'RE

02:00:02.962 --> 02:00:04.163
GONNA FIND SOMEBODY FIFTY

02:00:04.230 --> 02:00:05.531
THOUSAND DOLLARS I DON'T HAVE

02:00:05.598 --> 02:00:06.065
FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS IN YOUR

POCKET THEY'RE NOT GOING TO PAY

02:00:08.367 --> 02:00:10.436
FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. BUT IF

02:00:10.503 --> 02:00:13.573
IT CAN DETER 50% OR 60% OF THE

02:00:13.639 --> 02:00:15.441
PEOPLE THEY'RE ACTING OUT RIGHT

02:00:15.508 --> 02:00:18.144
NOW. INSTEAD OF DOING THAT

02:00:18.210 --> 02:00:20.112
DETER THEM FROM AND MAKE THEM

02:00:20.179 --> 02:00:21.914
UNDERSTAND THAT. HEY YOU KNOW

I'VE I'VE GOT PLENTY OF ASSETS

02:00:24.350 --> 02:00:24.850
AND SOME OF THOSE ASSETS ARE

02:00:24.917 --> 02:00:28.254
GOING TODISAPPEAR. BY ACT OUT.

02:00:28.321 --> 02:00:30.523
AT LEAST WE HAVE THAT YOU KNOW

02:00:30.590 --> 02:00:31.691
WE WISH THEY DIDN'T FEEL LIKE

02:00:31.757 --> 02:00:34.226
THAT. BUT WE CAN'T FIX THAT FOR

02:00:34.293 --> 02:00:36.362
THEM. WELL WE CAN FIX IS THE

02:00:36.429 --> 02:00:37.630
PART WHERE THEY'RE ACTING OUT

02:00:37.697 --> 02:00:38.898
OR AT LEAST WE CAN PROVIDE MORE

02:00:38.965 --> 02:00:41.067

OBVIOUSLY. THE CONSTITUTION

02:43:41.278 --> 02:43:42.412
GIVES A DEFENDANT THE RIGHT TO

02:44:03.300 --> 02:44:05.068
BECOMES EVIDENCE OF CONSENT.

02:44:05.135 --> 02:44:06.870
NOW YOU CAN USE THAT ANALYZE

02:44:06.937 --> 02:44:10.974
CLEAR. AS EVIDENCE TO. TALK

02:44:11.041 --> 02:44:11.942
ABOUT THE VERACITY WHICH HE

02:44:12.008 --> 02:44:13.310
SANG THE TRUTHFULNESS OF HER

02:44:13.376 --> 02:44:15.445
TESTIMONY THIS DOESN'T STOP YOU

02:44:15.512 --> 02:44:16.479
FROM DOING THAT AND I WANT THAT

02:44:16.546 --> 02:44:17.847
TO BE VERY VERY CLEAR IT JUST

02:44:17.914 --> 02:44:19.182
STOPS YOU FROM USING WHAT THE

02:44:19.249 --> 02:44:21.151
VICTIM'S WEARING. FOR PURPOSES

02:44:21.218 --> 02:44:23.153
OF CONSENT AND THE PROPOSITION

02:44:23.220 --> 02:44:25.689
ALLOWS US TO EXCLUDE. EVIDENCE

02:44:25.755 --> 02:44:27.257
THAT IS NOT RELEVANT THIS IS

02:44:27.324 --> 02:44:28.558
NOT RELEVANT TO THE QUESTION OF

02:44:28.625 --> 02:44:30.327
CONSENT BECAUSE CLOTHING DOES

02:44:30.393 --> 02:44:31.895
NOT GIVE ANYONE THE RIGHT TO

02:44:31.962 --> 02:44:34.698
SEXUALLY ASSAULT ANYBODY. AND

02:44:34.764 --> 02:44:36.566
SO I THINK IT IS HIGH TIME THAT

02:44:36.633 --> 02:44:37.801
WE DON'T PUT VICTIMS THROUGH

02:44:37.867 --> 02:44:38.802
THIS HEARING THAT THE LAW

02:44:38.868 --> 02:44:40.637
CURRENTLY ALLOWS. BECAUSE IS

02:44:40.704 --> 02:44:42.572
THAT THE OPPOSITION SAID IN HIS

02:44:42.639 --> 02:44:44.307
MAY BE THE CASE IT MAY HAPPEN

02:44:44.374 --> 02:44:45.542
AT THE END OF THAT HEARING MOST

02:44:45.609 --> 02:44:46.343
COURTS DON'T ADMIT THIS

02:44:46.409 --> 02:44:48.111
EVIDENCE. BUT THAT HEARING IS

02:44:48.178 --> 02:44:50.146
ENOUGH FOR US TO SAY. WE'RE NOT

02:44:50.213 --> 02:44:52.916
GONNA PUT VICTIMS THROUGH THAT

02:44:52.983 --> 02:44:53.483

02:52:09.052 --> 02:52:10.553
DISMISS TO PROTECT EXISTING

NAVIGATING THE COURT SYSTEM IS

02:52:41.284 --> 02:52:42.752
A DAUNTING PROCESS TO MOSTLY

02:52:42.819 --> 02:52:44.754
PEOPLE. AND IT FORCES THE

02:52:44.821 --> 02:52:46.489
VICTIM TO HAVE TO RE LIVE THE

02:52:46.556 --> 02:52:47.457

PRAYING THE JUDGE WILL GRANT IT.

02:52:52.095 --> 02:52:53.529

BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. IN AN

03:25:14.301 --> 03:25:16.504
ATTEMPT TO SUCCESSFULLY MIND

03:25:16.570 --> 03:25:19.173
YOU- TO STOP THE PASSAGE OF

03:25:19.240 --> 03:25:21.709
SIMILAR BILLS. AS WE HAD THE

03:25:21.776 --> 03:25:23.110
CONVERSATION THIS YEAR YOU KNOW

03:25:23.177 --> 03:25:24.979
IT STRUCK THE MEMBERS OF THE

03:25:25.046 --> 03:25:26.180
FECKLESS PROVISIONAL INNOVATION

03:25:26.247 --> 03:25:28.282
THAT. THAT SOMETHING HAD TO BE

03:25:28.349 --> 03:25:31.285
DIFFERENT THIS TIME. WE HAD TO

03:25:31.352 --> 03:25:33.154
WE HAD TO FIND A BETTER WAY TO

03:25:33.220 --> 03:25:34.088
DEAL WITH THESE KIDS QUITE

03:25:34.155 --> 03:25:35.656
FRANKLY AND I THINK THAT- WHEN

03:25:35.723 --> 03:25:37.258
THE SPONSORS AND- THE

03:25:37.324 --> 03:25:39.226
REPRESENTATIVES COOPER MYSELF.

03:25:39.293 --> 03:25:40.528
CAME TO THE REALIZATION THAT WE

03:25:40.594 --> 03:25:41.595
ALL CARED ABOUT THE SAME THING

03:25:41.662 --> 03:25:42.697
WHICH WAS BETTER OUTCOMES FOR

03:25:42.763 --> 03:25:44.732
THESE. YOUNG PEOPLE AND- IN

03:25:44.799 --> 03:25:46.801
CUSTODY I THINK. THAT REALLY

03:25:46.867 --> 03:25:49.537
SET US ON OUR WAY. THE ELEMENTS

03:25:49.603 --> 03:25:51.005
OF THE AGREEMENT I THINK TRY TO

03:25:51.072 --> 03:25:52.673
BALANCE SEVERAL FACTORS FIRST

03:25:52.740 --> 03:25:54.475
AND FOREMOST WITH THE SAFETY.

03:25:54.542 --> 03:25:56.410
OF NOT ONLY THE JUVENILES BUT

03:25:56.477 --> 03:25:58.345
THE STAFF IN THE FACILITIES.

03:25:58.412 --> 03:25:58.946
ONE OF THINGS THAT WERE VERY

03:25:59.013 --> 03:26:00.014
CONCERNED ABOUT IN THESE

03:26:00.081 --> 03:26:01.716
FACILITIES IS. WHENEVER THERE'S

03:26:01.782 --> 03:26:04.051
A FIGHT. THE STOPPING RACHEL'S

03:26:04.118 --> 03:26:05.486
IN CALIFORNIA ARE INADEQUATE

03:26:05.553 --> 03:26:06.587
AND I THINK THE SPONSORS AGREE

03:26:06.654 --> 03:26:07.388
WITH THEM THAT'S WHEN THE

03:26:07.455 --> 03:26:08.923
AMENDMENTS IN THE BILL AND I

03:26:08.989 --> 03:26:10.124
THINK AUTHORS STAFF ALSO WOULD

03:26:10.191 --> 03:26:13.027
AGREE. WITH YOU MORE PEOPLE ARE

03:26:13.094 --> 03:26:13.661
MORE STOP THEIR TO BILL A BREAK

03:26:13.728 --> 03:26:14.729
UP FIGHTS QUICKER. THE

03:26:14.795 --> 03:26:16.397
RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO OFFICERS

03:26:16.464 --> 03:26:17.898
IN JUVENILE FACILITIES ARE ARE

03:26:17.965 --> 03:26:19.900
VERY FEW. AND OF A BREAK THE

03:26:19.967 --> 03:26:21.068
FULL FIGHT BREAKS OUT NOT ONLY

03:26:21.135 --> 03:26:22.036
TO STOP FURTHER IN A PART OF

03:26:22.103 --> 03:26:24.371
TEN. KIDS IN THE TWO KIDS ARE

03:26:24.438 --> 03:26:25.339
IN A FIGHT. THE TO STOP FOR A

03:26:25.406 --> 03:26:27.041
JOINT. YOU HAVE EIGHT KIDS-

03:26:27.108 --> 03:26:29.577
UNSUPERVISED. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT

03:26:29.643 --> 03:26:30.845
A IT'S NOT A RECIPE FOR A GOOD

03:26:30.911 --> 03:26:32.813
OUTCOME. AND ITS POTENTIAL FOR

03:26:32.880 --> 03:26:34.682
ESCALATION OF THE VIOLENCE. THE

03:26:34.749 --> 03:26:36.183
THING THAT I WOULD SAY THAT WE

03:26:36.250 --> 03:26:37.218
ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE

03:26:37.284 --> 03:26:39.253
FACT THAT. PROBATION OFFICERS.

03:26:39.320 --> 03:26:40.621
DIFFERENT FROM RECORD FACULTY

03:26:40.688 --> 03:26:41.956
THE PREACHER IF THEY ENTER THE-

03:26:42.022 --> 03:26:43.724
PROFESSION. BECAUSE THEY

03:26:43.791 --> 03:26:44.792
BELIEVE IN REHABILITATION AND

03:26:44.859 --> 03:26:46.594
REENTRY. AND THEY WANT IT WHEN

03:26:46.660 --> 03:26:47.328
THEY WANT THESE KIDS TO BE

03:26:47.394 --> 03:26:49.463
SUCCESSFUL. AS A RESULT OF THAT

03:26:49.530 --> 03:26:51.098
I BELIEVE THAT. A LARGE NUMBER

03:26:51.165 --> 03:26:52.366
OF WOMEN INTO THE PROFESSIONS

03:26:52.433 --> 03:26:53.834
PROFESSIONALISM LARGE NOT NONE

03:26:53.901 --> 03:26:54.869
OF THEM WORKED IN JUVENILE

03:26:54.935 --> 03:26:56.737
FACILITIES. IN FACT MANY OF THE

03:26:56.804 --> 03:26:58.539
GIRAFFE TOYS ACROSS THE STATE.

03:26:58.606 --> 03:27:01.976
OVER. 50% OF THE OFFICERS AS

03:27:02.042 --> 03:27:04.478
WOMAN. THE WOMAN. MANY OF THESE

03:27:04.545 --> 03:27:07.715
WOMEN ARE SHORTER IN STATURE.

03:27:07.782 --> 03:27:08.349
FIVE FOUR THREE FIVE FOUR GOING

03:27:08.415 --> 03:27:08.916
TO HEAR FROM ONE OF THEM I

03:27:08.983 --> 03:27:11.185
THINK LATER OF FOR LOCAL SIX

03:27:11.252 --> 03:27:13.020
THIRTY FIVE. AND THE CHALLENGE

03:27:13.087 --> 03:27:15.089
BECOMES IF YOU HAVE- YOU KNOW

03:27:15.156 --> 03:27:18.392
OF IT INTELLECTUALLY A CHILD

03:27:18.459 --> 03:27:19.493
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN OR OLDER.

03:27:19.560 --> 03:27:21.629
BUT PHYSICALLY THEY COULD BE

03:27:21.695 --> 03:27:24.131
VERY IMPOSING SIX FOOT THREE

03:27:24.198 --> 03:27:25.533
TWO ONE FOUR BUT I'VE SEEN THEM

03:27:25.599 --> 03:27:26.300
I'VE VISITED I KNOW THAT

03:27:26.367 --> 03:27:27.735
THEY'RE THEY'RE BECOMES A VERY

03:27:27.802 --> 03:27:29.970
PRECARIOUS SITUATION SO WE TRY

03:27:30.037 --> 03:27:31.205
TO BALANCE THE INTERESTS OF

03:27:31.272 --> 03:27:32.506
THESE OFFICERS THESE BRAVE

03:27:32.573 --> 03:27:34.275
OFFICERS THAT DO THIS WORK. SO

03:27:34.341 --> 03:27:35.509
WE BELIEVE WE CAME UP WITH A

03:27:35.576 --> 03:27:37.344
COMPROMISE THAT MAKES SENSE WE

03:27:37.411 --> 03:27:40.948
WERE INCREASING STAFFING RATIOS

03:27:41.015 --> 03:27:42.049
AS OF JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY

03:27:42.116 --> 03:27:42.750
TWENTY TWO. WE ARE BANNING THE

03:27:42.817 --> 03:27:45.719
USE OF ALL CHEMICAL AGENTS. YOU

03:27:45.786 --> 03:27:46.287
KNOW TEAR GAS WAS MENTIONED

03:27:46.353 --> 03:27:49.456
REPEATEDLY. AS OF JANUARY FIRST

03:27:49.523 --> 03:27:50.925
TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND WE ARE

03:27:50.991 --> 03:27:52.426
DELAYING THE BAND OF PEPPER

03:27:52.493 --> 03:27:53.561
SPRAY FOR ANOTHER EIGHTEEN

03:27:53.627 --> 03:27:55.029
MONTHS TO GET THE L. A. ON

03:27:55.095 --> 03:27:56.564
OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE THE

03:27:56.630 --> 03:27:58.265
BEST PRACTICES NOT JUST IN

03:27:58.332 --> 03:27:58.799
CALIFORNIA BUT AROUND THE

03:27:58.866 --> 03:28:00.734
COUNTRY. BEFORE THE

03:28:00.801 --> 03:28:02.603
IMPLEMENTATION OF A OF A BAND

03:28:02.670 --> 03:28:03.571
OF PEPPER SPRAY AND FINALLY I

03:28:03.637 --> 03:28:05.339
WOULD SAY THAT THE ONE OF OUR

03:28:05.406 --> 03:28:07.007
BIGGEST CONCERNS WAS THE

03:28:07.074 --> 03:28:08.275
MASSIVE CHANGES THAT ARE

03:28:08.342 --> 03:28:09.009
HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA COMING

03:28:18.986 --> 03:28:20.321
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT POPULATION

03:28:20.387 --> 03:28:22.089
IT'S ENTIRELY NEW POPULATION AS

03:28:22.156 --> 03:28:24.024
ALL OF YOU KNOW THE STATE IS

03:28:24.091 --> 03:28:25.659
SLOWLY BUT SURELY NOT ONLY

03:28:25.726 --> 03:28:28.996
GOING OUT OF GETTING OUT OF THE

BUSINESS. OF HOUSING. MINORS

THAT AGE LIMIT IS MOVED TO

03:28:33.667 --> 03:28:34.168
TWENTY FIVE AND THAT'S BASED

03:28:34.235 --> 03:28:35.603
ON. SCIENCE AND THE DEVELOPMENT

03:28:35.669 --> 03:28:37.605

FIVE YEAR OLD MAYBE SHOULD BE

03:28:43.978 --> 03:28:45.212
TREATED DIFFERENTLY. AND IF THE

04:04:29.588 --> 04:04:31.356
WITHOUT SOME OTHER MEANS OF

04:04:31.423 --> 04:04:33.425
IMMEDIATELY CONTROLLING AN OUT

04:04:33.492 --> 04:04:36.294
OF CONTROL EVENT OTHER THAN

04:04:36.361 --> 04:04:36.895
JUST YELLING HEY YOU GUYS STOP

04:04:36.962 --> 04:04:39.865
IT. THAT'S NOT EFFECTIVE IN

04:04:39.931 --> 04:04:41.266
THOSE ENVIRONMENTS THAT'S ONE

04:04:41.333 --> 04:04:42.634
OF THE REASONS THOSE KIDS ARE

04:04:42.701 --> 04:04:44.603
THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

04:04:44.669 --> 04:04:45.837
BECAUSE WHAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING

04:04:45.904 --> 04:04:47.839
TO DO IS TRYING TO KEEP THEM

04:04:47.906 --> 04:04:51.309
SAFE REHABILITATE THEM BUT ALSO

04:04:51.376 --> 04:04:53.078
WE HAVE TO HAVE METHODS THAT

04:04:53.145 --> 04:04:55.781
ARE LESS THAN LETHAL METHODS.

04:04:55.847 --> 04:04:57.549
TO MAKE THAT ENVIRONMENT SAFE

04:04:57.616 --> 04:04:59.985
ENOUGH FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO

04:05:00.052 --> 04:05:02.487
ACHIEVE THE END GOAL WHICH IS

04:05:02.554 --> 04:05:03.922
THEY GET OUT AND THEY'RE BETTER.

04:05:03.989 --> 04:05:06.358
SOME OF THESE ARE THINGS THAT

04:05:06.425 --> 04:05:08.093
THEY TALKED ABOUT EARLIER-

04:05:08.160 --> 04:05:10.262
THEY'VE WITNESSED TALKED ABOUT-

04:05:10.328 --> 04:05:11.897
I APPLAUD THOSE EFFORTS AND I

04:05:11.963 --> 04:05:14.533
HOPE THEY WORK. AND IF THEY DO

04:05:14.599 --> 04:05:16.468
WORK THEN EVENTUALLY. THERE

04:05:16.535 --> 04:05:18.837
WON'T BE A NEED FOR ANYBODY TO

04:05:18.904 --> 04:05:24.142
USE. THE PEPPER SPRAY. BUT

04:05:24.209 --> 04:05:25.777
UNTIL WE HAVE THAT IN PLACE

04:05:25.844 --> 04:05:27.846
UNTIL WE KNOW THAT WORKS I

04:05:27.913 --> 04:05:29.581
CAN'T IMAGINE TAKING AWAY ONE

04:05:29.648 --> 04:05:32.751
OF THE TOOLS THAT IS SUCCESSFUL

04:05:32.818 --> 04:05:35.454
AND HELPING CONTROL THAT TYPE

04:05:35.520 --> 04:05:37.789
OF INCIDENT. AND THAT'S WHAT I

04:05:37.856 --> 04:05:40.926
THINK THIS PEPPER SPRAY YES IS

04:05:40.992 --> 04:05:43.161
IT UNCOMFORTABLE YEP. I'VE BEEN

04:05:43.228 --> 04:05:45.230

04:05:45.297 --> 04:05:46.498
GLAD I WAS BECAUSE THE

04:05:46.565 --> 04:05:48.467
ALTERNATIVE WAS WHATEVER

04:05:48.533 --> 04:05:49.434
INCIDENT WERE AND GETS OUT OF

04:05:49.501 --> 04:05:52.604
CONTROL. AND I AM I AM I LOSE.

04:05:52.671 --> 04:05:54.739
AND SO- YES IT'S VERY

04:05:54.806 --> 04:05:57.809
UNCOMFORTABLE AND YES YOU CAN

YOU CAN GET IT WASHED OUT YOUR

04:05:58.777 --> 04:06:02.514
EYES. AND IT'LL GO ON- BUT

04:06:02.581 --> 04:06:03.415
WITHOUT A TOOL IN THEIR TOOL

04:06:03.482 --> 04:06:05.951
BELT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF

04:06:06.017 --> 04:06:07.719
THESE WITHOUT FURTHER INJURING

04:06:07.786 --> 04:06:10.288
ANYBODY BY RESTRAINING OR DOING

04:06:10.355 --> 04:06:12.090
ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I JUST

04:06:12.157 --> 04:06:13.692
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S LEFT FOR THEM

04:06:13.758 --> 04:06:15.794

04:42:55.024 --> 04:42:56.192

04:43:07.170 --> 04:43:11.708
FALLS KIND OF SHORT ON ME-

04:43:11.774 --> 04:43:14.043
HAVING WATCH THIS INVOLVED OVER

04:43:46.442 --> 04:43:48.311
WITH THE COST FORTUNATELY THE

04:43:48.378 --> 04:43:49.846
MILITARY ALREADY HAD A LOT OF

04:43:49.912 --> 04:43:52.081
THAT BETTER EQUIPMENT AND SO

04:43:52.148 --> 04:43:52.982
THEY WERE ABLE TO TAP INTO

04:43:53.049 --> 04:43:55.551
THOSE. AND THAT'S THAT'S WHERE

04:43:55.618 --> 04:43:58.221
THIS STARTED- THEY WOUND UP

04:43:58.287 --> 04:44:00.256
WITH SWAT TEAMS AND THEY WOUND

04:44:00.323 --> 04:44:02.425

TEAMS THAT DEALT WITH SPECIALTY

04:44:06.362 --> 04:44:09.031

04:44:09.098 --> 04:44:11.267
DAY A LOT OF THE THIS EQUIPMENT

04:44:11.334 --> 04:44:15.004

04:45:36.185 --> 04:45:38.921
OWN RANKS MAKE SENSE TO ME. BUT

04:45:38.988 --> 04:45:40.289
THE BILL HERE SHOULD DO TWO

04:45:40.356 --> 04:45:41.491
THINGS WHICH I PUT FORTH A

WITH SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES WHO

04:46:14.290 --> 04:46:17.059
TODAY'S BILL- THAT- THERE ARE

04:46:17.126 --> 04:46:19.095

STREET TO CALIFORNIA WE WANT-

WELL EQUIPPED TO BE ABLE TO

04:46:24.567 --> 04:46:25.535
DEAL WITH THE SITUATION I JUST

04:46:25.601 --> 04:46:30.006
WANNA MAKE IT VERY CLEAR. THAT

04:46:30.072 --> 04:46:30.640
THIS BILL DOES NOT FORBID. THE

04:46:30.706 --> 04:46:32.408
BILL FOR ENFORCEMENT TO OBTAIN

04:46:32.475 --> 04:46:33.809
THAT EQUIPMENT- WHAT THIS SAYS

04:46:33.876 --> 04:46:35.978
IS THE- CONCEPT OF THIS BILL

04:46:36.045 --> 04:46:37.580
IS. LET'S MAKE SURE THAT

04:46:37.647 --> 04:46:39.248
THERE'S A PUBLIC PROCESS WHERE

04:46:39.315 --> 04:46:42.451
THERE IS A DECISION MADE ABOUT-

04:46:42.518 --> 04:46:44.320
HOW THOSE WEAPONS ARE OBTAINED

04:46:44.387 --> 04:46:45.087
AND WHEN THEY'RE GONNA BE USED

04:46:45.154 --> 04:46:46.489
AND LET'S HAVE A PROCESS. AND

04:46:46.556 --> 04:46:47.557
UNDERSTAND WHEN THEY'RE GOING

04:46:47.623 --> 04:46:49.492
TO BE USED- SO THAT'S THAT'S

04:46:49.559 --> 04:46:51.961
THE CORE OF THIS- WE HAVE PUT

04:46:52.028 --> 04:46:54.030
IN SOME PROCESS HERE AND- TO

04:46:54.096 --> 04:46:56.499
OUR OUR COLLEAGUES POINT- WE'RE

04:46:56.566 --> 04:46:57.199
WE'RE WILLING TO HAVE

04:46:57.266 --> 04:46:58.367
CONVERSATIONS LAW ENFORCEMENT

04:46:58.434 --> 04:46:59.535
AND EXACTLY HOW THAT GETS

04:46:59.602 --> 04:47:00.870
STRUCTURED. BUT I THINK FROM

04:47:00.937 --> 04:47:02.171
OUR PERSPECTIVE WE WANT TO HAVE

04:47:02.238 --> 04:47:03.439
ACCOUNTABILITY AND WE WANT TO

04:47:03.506 --> 04:47:05.374
HAVE TRANSPARENCY BOTH AND WHEN

04:47:05.441 --> 04:47:07.643
THIS EQUIPMENT IS OBTAINED AND

04:47:07.710 --> 04:47:08.678
WHEN IT'S USED WE WANT TO BE

04:47:08.744 --> 04:47:10.012
ABLE TO HAVE SOME VALUATION

04:47:10.079 --> 04:47:11.247
THAT THAT'S- FUNDAMENTALLY AT

04:47:11.314 --> 04:47:13.983
THE CORE- AND- AND AGAIN WE'RE

04:47:14.050 --> 04:47:15.017
WILLING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION.

04:47:15.084 --> 04:47:16.686
ABOUT THAT APPRECIATE- THAT

04:47:16.752 --> 04:47:19.355
THERE ARE SOME- REPRESENTS OF

04:47:19.422 --> 04:47:20.389
LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT WE ARE

04:47:20.456 --> 04:47:22.358
ENGAGING WITH TO REALLY TIGHTEN

04:47:22.425 --> 04:47:24.026
THIS UP- BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND

04:47:24.093 --> 04:47:25.127
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION

04:47:25.194 --> 04:47:26.228
THERE ARE SOME WHO THINK THAT

04:47:26.295 --> 04:47:27.997
THERE OUGHT TO NOT BE.

04:47:28.064 --> 04:47:29.298
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

04:47:29.365 --> 04:47:31.100
WITH REGARDS TO THIS AND

04:47:31.167 --> 04:47:32.568
FUNDAMENTALLY THAT'S WHAT THIS

04:47:32.635 --> 04:47:35.237
BILL IS ABOUT- THERE ARE

04:47:35.304 --> 04:47:36.172
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO THINK

04:47:36.238 --> 04:47:37.807
THAT YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL

04:47:37.873 --> 04:47:38.841
AGREE OUR STREETS SHOULD NOT BE

04:47:38.908 --> 04:47:40.610
WAR ZONES CITIZENS ARE NOT

04:47:40.676 --> 04:47:43.145
ENEMY COMBATANTS- AND THERE ARE

04:47:43.212 --> 04:47:45.047
FOLKS WHO. WOULD LOVE TO BAN

04:47:45.114 --> 04:47:46.649
MILITARY EQUIPMENT THAT IS

04:47:46.716 --> 04:47:47.416
AGAIN NOT WHAT THIS BILL DOES

04:47:47.483 --> 04:47:50.386
WERE ESTABLISHING ESTABLISHING

04:47:50.453 --> 04:47:53.923
PROCESS. THANK YOU M. SO I MEAN

04:47:53.990 --> 04:47:55.625
I. AGREE WITH YOU THAT I THINK

04:47:55.691 --> 04:47:57.493
THIS BILL IS. IS NARROWED IN

04:47:57.560 --> 04:47:58.327
SCOPE IN A WAY THAT'S

04:47:58.394 --> 04:47:59.428
APPROPRIATE I MEAN THE PART

04:47:59.495 --> 04:48:00.830
THAT SAYS THAT THE GOVERNING

04:48:00.896 --> 04:48:01.964
BODY SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE

04:48:02.031 --> 04:48:03.299
PURCHASE IS THE MOST COST

04:48:03.366 --> 04:48:05.101
EFFECTIVE OF ALTERNATIVES WE

04:48:05.167 --> 04:48:05.835
SHOULD DO THAT WITH EVERYTHING

04:48:05.901 --> 04:48:07.336
THAT. I THOUGHT I REALLY

04:48:07.403 --> 04:48:09.138
APPRECIATE THAT PIECE OF IT. I

04:48:09.205 --> 04:48:10.272
DON'T THINK WE DO THAT OFTEN

04:48:10.339 --> 04:48:12.742
ENOUGH. IN USING HARD EARNED

04:48:12.808 --> 04:48:15.811
TAXPAYER DOLLARS. SO I WILL BE

04:48:15.878 --> 04:48:17.013
SUPPORTING IT BUT I DO THINK

04:48:17.079 --> 04:48:18.247
THERE IS A WAY TO NARROW IT TO

04:48:18.314 --> 04:48:19.448
ENSURE THAT THE GOVERNING BODY

04:48:19.515 --> 04:48:21.317
CREATES THIS POLICY BUT ALSO

04:48:21.384 --> 04:48:23.519
ENABLES. THESE LAW ENFORCEMENT

04:48:23.586 --> 04:48:24.453
AGENCIES TO GO OUT AND GET

04:48:24.520 --> 04:48:25.554
THESE PIECES WILL COME WHEN

04:48:25.621 --> 04:48:26.555
THEY ARE AVAILABLE ON SHORT

04:48:26.622 --> 04:48:27.723
NOTICE I DON'T THINK THOSE TWO

04:48:27.790 --> 04:48:29.525
THINGS ARE INCONSISTENT AND SO.

04:48:29.592 --> 04:48:30.760
I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT

04:48:30.826 --> 04:48:31.861
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE WORK WITH

04:48:31.927 --> 04:48:32.728
LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THAT ISSUE

04:48:32.795 --> 04:48:33.829
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S EASILY

04:48:33.896 --> 04:48:35.598
FIXED AND THE STUFF. AND I

04:48:35.665 --> 04:48:36.932
WOULD SAY BECAUSE THIS WAS A

04:48:36.999 --> 04:48:38.601
PROBABLY THE ONE MAIN ISSUE

04:48:38.668 --> 04:48:40.436
RAISED BY. THE SHERIFF'S AND

04:48:40.503 --> 04:48:41.604
THEIR OPPOSITION THAT I ALSO

04:48:41.671 --> 04:48:43.539
SUPPORT WE DO NOT WANT TO HAVE

04:48:43.606 --> 04:48:45.708
POLICY PROCESS THAT DELAYS THE

04:48:45.775 --> 04:48:47.209
ABILITY TO GET IT. WHAT WE ARE

04:48:47.276 --> 04:48:48.377
ASKING OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

04:48:48.444 --> 04:48:49.578
THOUGH IS. IF YOU CAN

04:48:49.645 --> 04:48:51.414
ANTICIPATE THAT THERE MIGHT.

04:48:51.480 --> 04:48:52.248
BECOME A PROCUREMENT

04:48:52.314 --> 04:48:53.983
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS GET

04:48:54.050 --> 04:48:55.151
PRIOR APPROVAL SO THAT YOU'RE

04:48:55.217 --> 04:48:56.185
READY TO GO WHEN THAT

04:48:56.252 --> 04:48:57.853
OPPORTUNITY COMES UP. IF IT

04:48:57.920 --> 04:48:59.321
TURNS OUT. THAT THERE'S AN

04:48:59.388 --> 04:49:00.756
UNEXPECTED OPPORTUNITY TO

04:49:00.823 --> 04:49:01.957
OBTAIN THAT EQUIPMENT LET'S

04:49:02.024 --> 04:49:03.025
HAVE A PROCESS TO DEAL WITH

04:49:03.092 --> 04:49:04.560
THAT EXISTENCE CIRCUMSTANCE I'M

04:49:04.627 --> 04:49:06.696
OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION. BUT

04:49:06.762 --> 04:49:07.329
THE IDEA OF NOT HAVING A

04:49:07.396 --> 04:49:09.632
PROCESS- TO CONTEMPLATE THIS

04:49:09.699 --> 04:49:14.103
THAT'S WHAT. THAT'S THAT'S NOT

04:49:14.170 --> 04:49:14.637
WHAT I THINK. THIS BILL IS

04:49:14.704 --> 04:49:17.473
ABOUT. K. YOUR COMMENTS OR

04:49:17.540 --> 04:49:20.142
QUESTIONS. MISTER MISTER TO

04:49:20.209 --> 04:49:22.411
MAKE I JUST WANT TO FIRST

04:49:22.478 --> 04:49:25.347
APPRECIATE- ALL OUR COALITION

04:49:25.414 --> 04:49:25.948
FOR WAITING FOR A COUPLE OF

04:49:26.015 --> 04:49:27.416
HOURS I REALLY DO ALSO

04:49:27.483 --> 04:49:29.485
APPRECIATE THIS COMMITTEE FOR

04:49:29.552 --> 04:49:31.387
HOW MANY HOURS YOU WORK IN- IN

04:49:31.454 --> 04:49:33.956
ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES- I LOOK

04:49:34.023 --> 04:49:35.024
FOR TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS

04:49:35.091 --> 04:49:36.092
ABOUT THIS AND I WILL SAY TO

04:49:36.158 --> 04:49:38.828
LAW ENFORCEMENT- WE ARE OPEN TO

04:49:38.894 --> 04:49:40.229
A CONVERSATION OF HOW TO DO

04:49:40.296 --> 04:49:41.030
THIS IN A REASONABLE WAY BUT

04:49:41.097 --> 04:49:43.466
AGAIN. THIS IS ABOUT INCREASING

04:49:43.532 --> 04:49:44.834
TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY

04:49:44.900 --> 04:49:46.068
THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY WHAT WE'RE

04:49:46.135 --> 04:49:47.303
TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND THE

04:49:47.369 --> 04:49:48.938
REASON WE'RE DOING THAT IS

04:49:49.004 --> 04:49:50.539
BECAUSE WE WANT TO REBUILD

04:49:50.606 --> 04:49:52.007
COMMUNITY TRUST BETWEEN LAW

04:49:52.074 --> 04:49:53.609
ENFORCEMENT AND OUR COMMUNITIES

04:49:53.676 --> 04:49:56.078
AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS TYPE

04:49:56.145 --> 04:49:56.846
OF TRANSPARENCY THIS TYPE OF

04:49:56.912 --> 04:49:59.348
ACCOUNTABILITY WILL HELP TO

04:49:59.415 --> 04:50:01.417
FURTHER THAT AND WITH THAT I

04:50:01.484 --> 04:50:02.752

GAVE ME TO HISTORY. OF WHY THEY

04:50:15.965 --> 04:50:17.032

04:50:17.099 --> 04:50:18.534
IT'S REALLY GOOD THAT WE

04:50:18.601 --> 04:50:20.569

04:50:20.636 --> 04:50:23.038

04:50:27.443 --> 04:50:30.346
ALSO TO REMEMBER. DURING MY

04:50:30.412 --> 04:50:33.916
TIME IN LA IN A CRACK COCAINE

04:50:33.983 --> 04:50:38.154
TIME IN LA THE MILITARY. THE

04:50:38.220 --> 04:50:39.955
MILITARY EQUIPMENT THAT WAS

04:50:40.022 --> 04:50:43.225
USED IN MY AREA WHERE I LIVE

04:50:43.292 --> 04:50:45.127
THE BATTERY AMENT OTHER THINGS

04:50:45.194 --> 04:50:47.863
WAS OUT OF CONTROL. AN INNOCENT

04:50:47.930 --> 04:50:50.499
PEOPLE. WERE HURT INNOCENT

04:50:50.566 --> 04:50:53.636
PEOPLE WERE KILLED. IN RAIDS

04:50:53.702 --> 04:50:54.603
AND THAT'S WHERE THIS COMES

04:50:54.670 --> 04:50:56.972
FROM ESPECIALLY WHEN THE LOS

04:50:57.039 --> 04:50:59.375
ANGELES CITY COUNCIL DIDN'T

04:50:59.441 --> 04:51:02.244

PROBABLY SAYS SOMETHING ELSE A

04:51:09.185 --> 04:51:11.520
LITTLE HARSHER SO THAT'S- WHY

04:51:11.587 --> 04:51:13.455
YOUR BILL IS SO IMPORTANT AS

04:51:13.522 --> 04:51:15.324

SENTENCING AND OVER

05:53:26.785 --> 05:53:28.820
INCARCERATION IN OUR SOCIETY.

05:53:28.887 --> 05:53:31.156
IT IS NOT. A GUN CONTROL

05:53:31.223 --> 05:53:32.991
MEASURE BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW

05:53:33.058 --> 05:53:34.126
IF WE WAITED TILL THE

05:53:34.192 --> 05:53:35.360
SENTENCING TO A PERSON IS

05:53:35.427 --> 05:53:37.062
CONVICTED WE SLAP ON SENTENCE

05:53:37.129 --> 05:53:39.164
ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE HAVE

05:53:39.231 --> 05:53:40.165
FAILED TO PROACTIVE PREVENT GUN

05:53:40.232 --> 05:53:42.734
VIOLENCE. GUN SAFETY IS GUN

05:53:42.801 --> 05:53:44.002
CONTROL UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND

05:53:44.069 --> 05:53:45.637
CHECKS MAKING SURE DANGEROUS

05:53:45.704 --> 05:53:46.171
WEAPONS ARE ON THE STREETS

05:53:46.238 --> 05:53:49.341
THAT'S PREVENTATIVE THIS IS AN

05:53:49.408 --> 05:53:50.175
EXCESSIVE RESPONSE AND I JUST

05:53:50.242 --> 05:53:51.710
WANT ALSO MAKE SURE TO KNOW

05:53:51.777 --> 05:53:53.078
THAT YOU KNOW IF SOMEONE DOES

05:53:53.145 --> 05:53:54.780
COMMIT A CRIME THEY STILL SERVE

05:53:54.846 --> 05:53:56.348
THEIR STATUTORY SENTENCE THEY

05:53:56.415 --> 05:53:58.684
STILL SERVICE. GUN ENHANCEMENTS

05:53:58.750 --> 05:54:01.019
ARE AN ADULT ADD ON THAT CAN

05:54:01.086 --> 05:54:02.955
SOMETIMES MAGNIFIED A CLUB

05:54:03.021 --> 05:54:05.090
MAGNIFIED THERE- SUCH AS FOR

05:54:05.157 --> 05:54:06.925
MUCH MORE SO I THINK LIKE I

05:54:06.992 --> 05:54:09.995
SAID IF WE- IF THESE WERE.

05:54:10.062 --> 05:54:10.729
EFFECTIVE MEASURES PREVENTING

05:54:10.796 --> 05:54:12.564
GUN CRIME THEN WE WOULD SEE

05:54:12.631 --> 05:54:13.832
THAT WE SEE THE RESULTS IN A

05:54:13.899 --> 05:54:14.633
REALITY THAT WOULD BE THE

05:54:14.700 --> 05:54:16.168
SAFEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD AND

05:54:16.234 --> 05:54:17.035
YET WERE NOT WORN OUT WHERE

05:54:17.102 --> 05:54:19.037
THESE THINGS. ARE IT ALSO

05:54:19.104 --> 05:54:20.172
OBVIOUSLY AS I SAID IN MY

05:54:20.238 --> 05:54:21.640
OPENING EVERY YEAR OF

05:54:21.707 --> 05:54:24.109
INCARCERATION. LEADS AT LEAST

05:54:24.176 --> 05:54:25.877
47% CHANCE OF RECENT INCREASED

05:54:25.944 --> 05:54:27.546
CHANCE OF RECIDIVISM SO BY ANY

05:54:27.613 --> 05:54:28.847
METRIC I DON'T THINK WE'RE

05:54:28.914 --> 05:54:30.415
SUCCEEDING AND- WASTING.

05:54:30.482 --> 05:54:31.617
UPWARDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

05:54:31.683 --> 05:54:32.985
PER PERSON JUST TO KEEP SOMEONE

05:54:33.051 --> 05:54:34.252
OVERLY INCARCERATED SO I WOULD

05:54:34.319 --> 05:54:36.455
SAY BY FISCAL METRICS BUYER

05:54:36.521 --> 05:54:37.823
SEVEN METRICS ABOUT GUN SAFETY

05:54:37.889 --> 05:54:39.925
METRICS IT'S NOT WORKING. SO I

05:54:39.992 --> 05:54:41.994
WOULD SAY BY MY METRIC WHICH IS

05:54:42.060 --> 05:54:43.595
WE KEEP THE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO

05:54:43.662 --> 05:54:44.930
PERPETRATE CRIMES LIKE THIS

05:54:44.997 --> 05:54:46.665
SOME PEOPLE SEPARATE FROM THE

05:54:46.732 --> 05:54:48.533
LAW ABIDING CITIZENS THAT ARE

05:54:48.600 --> 05:54:49.635
JUST DO MINE IN THEIR OWN

05:54:49.701 --> 05:54:50.936
BUSINESS WHEN THEY GET A GUN

05:54:51.003 --> 05:54:54.039
STUCK IN THEIR FACE- HI I THINK

05:54:54.106 --> 05:54:57.109
IT IS EFFECTIVE. AND I THINK

05:54:57.175 --> 05:54:58.910
ONE PERSON HAS A CHOICE AND

05:54:58.977 --> 05:55:00.112
THAT'S THE PERSON THAT DOES THE

05:55:00.178 --> 05:55:01.613
GUN STICKING IN THERE FOR

05:55:01.680 --> 05:55:03.281
STICKING IT IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S

05:55:03.348 --> 05:55:04.683
FACE THEY HAVE A CHOICE TO

05:55:04.750 --> 05:55:10.689
THINK ABOUT. WHETHER THEY FEEL

05:55:10.756 --> 05:55:11.456
LIKE DOING. THE EX TIME. FOR

05:55:11.523 --> 05:55:13.892
USING THAT GUN. AND TERRIFYING

05:55:13.959 --> 05:55:16.495
SOME VICTIMS AND THE VICTIM

05:55:16.561 --> 05:55:17.963
DOES NOT HAVE A CHOICE THEY

05:55:18.030 --> 05:55:19.731
JUST SIT THERE BE VICTIMIZED

05:55:19.798 --> 05:55:21.199
AND SO THAT'S WHERE I THINK

05:55:21.266 --> 05:55:22.567
THAT YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE

05:55:22.634 --> 05:55:23.035
WAY OUR DIFFERENCE IN

05:55:23.101 --> 05:55:25.771
PHILOSOPHIES IS THAT I AM ALL

05:55:25.837 --> 05:55:28.774
ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE

05:55:28.840 --> 05:55:30.509
VICTIMS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE

05:55:30.575 --> 05:55:32.678
PROTECTED HERE AND YEAH I DO

05:55:32.744 --> 05:55:34.479
WANT TO HELP PEOPLE THAT WANT

05:55:34.546 --> 05:55:36.581
TO HELP THEMSELVES. BUT IF

05:55:36.648 --> 05:55:38.483
YOU'RE GOING TO IGNORE THE

05:55:38.550 --> 05:55:40.352
SENTENCING NICK ENHANCEMENTS

05:55:40.419 --> 05:55:42.888
AND DO IT ANYWAY AND TERRORIZE

05:55:42.954 --> 05:55:44.956
SOMEBODY BY STICKING A GUN IN

05:55:45.023 --> 05:55:45.590
THE FACE AND BY THE WAY DOESN'T

05:55:45.657 --> 05:55:48.927
FEEL VERY GOOD- I CAN TELL YOU

05:55:48.994 --> 05:55:52.564
FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE. AND YOU

05:55:52.631 --> 05:55:53.865
KNOW WHAT I DON'T FEEL SORRY

05:55:53.932 --> 05:55:55.634
FOR YOU YOU GOT TO THINK ABOUT

05:55:55.701 --> 05:55:56.702
WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND WE GOT TO

05:55:56.768 --> 05:55:58.203
BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT

05:55:58.270 --> 05:55:59.738
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS DOING

05:55:59.805 --> 05:56:01.273
ITS HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE.

05:56:01.339 --> 05:56:03.008
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

05:56:03.075 --> 05:56:05.377
STATISTICS ARE FOR THE AMOUNT

05:56:05.444 --> 05:56:06.511
OF PEOPLE THAT DIDN'T DO THE

05:56:06.578 --> 05:56:08.146
CRIME BECAUSE THEY DID THINK

05:56:08.213 --> 05:56:10.282
ABOUT HEY YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T

05:56:10.348 --> 05:56:12.651
FEEL LIKE GO ON GOING UP UP THE

05:56:12.718 --> 05:56:16.321
RIVER. FOR TWENTY MORE YEARS.

05:56:16.388 --> 05:56:16.955
FOR USING A GUN. WE HAVE THOSE

05:56:17.022 --> 05:56:18.190
STATISTICS BECAUSE WE DON'T DO

05:56:18.256 --> 05:56:19.791
STUDIES ON THIS. AND THOSE ARE

05:56:19.858 --> 05:56:21.359
THE THINGS THAT I THINK ABOUT.

05:56:21.426 --> 05:56:22.861
AND BEFORE ANYTHING I THINK

05:56:22.928 --> 05:56:24.529
ABOUT THE VICTIMS. AND THAT'S

05:56:24.596 --> 05:56:26.198
WHY I'M TIMES CAN'T BE

05:56:26.264 --> 05:56:28.333
SUPPORTING- LEGISLATION LIKE.

05:56:28.400 --> 05:56:32.704

STATE- I TOTALLY AGREE

CALIFORNIA WANTS AN

05:57:12.377 --> 05:57:12.811
INTERVENTION PREVENTION

TO INCREASE THAT MONEY. THAT

05:57:25.524 --> 05:57:27.659
SUPPORTS PROGRAMS. NONPROFIT

05:57:27.726 --> 05:57:29.060
ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE FROM

05:57:29.127 --> 05:57:30.195
THESE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE DOING

05:57:30.262 --> 05:57:31.496
VERY EFFECTIVE GUN VIOLENCE

05:57:31.563 --> 05:57:32.664
PREVENTION WORK AND IT'S

05:57:32.731 --> 05:57:33.665
STOPPING VIOLENCE BEFORE IT

05:57:33.732 --> 05:57:35.400
STARTS. AND IT NEEDS AN ONGOING

05:57:35.467 --> 05:57:36.935
FUNDING STREAM. SO I WOULD JUST

05:57:42.440 --> 05:57:42.974
YOU BE INTERESTED IN. PURSUING

COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR COMMENTS

05:57:56.922 --> 05:57:58.590
ON THIS BILL THIS IS A HARD ONE

05:57:58.657 --> 05:58:00.525
AND YOU KNOW I AM A

05:58:00.592 --> 05:58:02.027
LONGSTANDING SUPPORTER OF GUN

05:58:02.093 --> 05:58:03.728
VIOLENCE PREVENTION I THINK TO

05:58:03.795 --> 05:58:05.397
YOUR POINT ALL OF THE DATA

05:58:05.463 --> 05:58:07.999
SHOWS US THAT LONG SENTENCES

05:58:08.066 --> 05:58:09.835
DON'T PREVENT CRIME BUT IT'S

05:58:09.901 --> 05:58:11.536
NOT MAKING US SAFER AND IT'S

05:58:11.603 --> 05:58:11.970
JUST LEADING TO OVER

05:58:12.037 --> 05:58:14.873
INCARCERATION. AND SO I THINK

05:58:14.940 --> 05:58:16.041
TO MISS WEEKES IS POINT WE

05:58:16.107 --> 05:58:16.842
REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE

05:58:16.908 --> 05:58:20.145
PREVENT THIS CRIME IN REALLY

05:58:20.212 --> 05:58:21.446
MEANINGFUL WAYS AND NOT JUST.

05:58:21.513 --> 05:58:23.148
IN PERSUADING PEOPLE FOR

05:58:23.215 --> 05:58:25.517
DECADES- TIER POINTS

05:58:25.584 --> 05:58:26.718
INDIVIDUALS WILL STILL SERVE

05:58:26.785 --> 05:58:28.086
THEIR UNDERLYING SENTENCE NO

05:58:28.153 --> 05:58:29.120
MATTER WHAT THE CRIME WAS THAT

05:58:29.187 --> 05:58:31.489
WAS COMMITTED. HE ALSO RETAIN

05:58:31.556 --> 05:58:33.391
SOME ENHANCEMENTS IN THIS BILL-

05:58:33.458 --> 05:58:34.726
AND I THINK THAT THAT

05:58:34.793 --> 05:58:39.898
PROSPECTIVELY IS. REALLY- MAKES

05:58:39.965 --> 05:58:41.800
A LOT OF SENSE ADAM YOU KNOW

05:58:41.867 --> 05:58:43.435
LISTENING TO YOUR FIRST WITNESS

05:58:43.501 --> 05:58:46.638
ABOUT. AND WHAT IT MEANS TO SIT

05:58:46.705 --> 05:58:47.205
IN A ROOM WITH THE DEFENDANT

05:58:47.272 --> 05:58:49.708
AND TELL THEM. THAT THEY SHOULD

05:58:49.774 --> 05:58:50.675
GO TO TRIAL BECAUSE THE

05:58:50.742 --> 05:58:51.910
SENTENCE IS GOING TO BE TOO

05:58:51.977 --> 05:58:53.612
INSANE IF THEY DO AND THE RISK

05:58:53.678 --> 05:58:55.547
ISN'T WORTH IT I'VE DONE THAT

05:58:55.614 --> 05:58:56.214
AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT SHE'S

05:58:56.281 --> 05:58:57.949
SAYING AND I THINK THAT. THAT'S

05:58:58.016 --> 05:58:59.918
REALLY WE NEED TO UNDER. EACH

05:58:59.985 --> 05:59:01.686
KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING. AT THE

05:59:01.753 --> 05:59:03.755
SAME TIME HAVING. BEEN IN THOSE

05:59:03.822 --> 05:59:05.457
ROOMS I ALSO KNOW HOW PLEA

05:59:05.523 --> 05:59:07.192
DEALS ARE MADE. AND SO THE FACT

05:59:07.259 --> 05:59:08.760
THAT THIS IS RETROACTIVE IS

05:59:08.827 --> 05:59:10.262
CONCERNING TO ME BECAUSE DEALS

05:59:10.328 --> 05:59:12.464
WERE MADE. AND WE ARE GOING

05:59:12.530 --> 05:59:13.865
BACK ON THOSE DEALS IN WAYS

05:59:13.932 --> 05:59:14.766
THAT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN MADE

05:59:14.833 --> 05:59:16.668
PROBABLY. IN DIFFERENT WAYS HAD

05:59:16.735 --> 05:59:18.436
THIS BEEN IN PLACE AT THE TIME.

05:59:18.503 --> 05:59:19.938
AND SO I KNOW THAT YOU AND I

05:59:20.005 --> 05:59:21.206
DISCUSSED IT AND I WOULD BE

05:59:21.273 --> 05:59:23.275
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE. COMFORTABLE

05:59:23.341 --> 05:59:24.576
IT IF THERE WAS SOME JUDICIAL

05:59:24.643 --> 05:59:27.445
DISCRETION OR SOME. REVIEW OF

05:59:27.512 --> 05:59:28.813
THE RETROACTIVE PIECE TO ENSURE

05:59:28.880 --> 05:59:30.215
THAT PEOPLE ARE SERVING A JUST

05:59:30.282 --> 05:59:32.317
SENTENCE THAT THEY ARE NOT. A

05:59:32.384 --> 05:59:34.352
THREAT TO THE COMMUNITY- AND

05:59:34.419 --> 05:59:35.720
THAT YOU KNOW IT IS TIME TO LET

05:59:35.787 --> 05:59:37.355
THEM OUT AND SO. I JUST WANNA

05:59:37.422 --> 05:59:38.957
GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO

05:59:39.024 --> 05:59:39.557
ADDRESS THEIR ATTRACTIVE THE

05:59:39.624 --> 05:59:41.726
PEACE. YES CERTAINLY AND I

05:59:41.793 --> 05:59:43.228
THANK YOU SO EVER CANNED FOR

DISTURBING IS WHEN FOLKS

THAT WE HAVE COLLEGE EDUCATED

06:08:27.018 --> 06:08:28.553
OFFICERS WORKING IN ALL OF OUR

06:08:32.723 --> 06:08:34.192
CALIFORNIA AGENCIES CURRENTLY

06:08:34.258 --> 06:08:35.560

06:08:35.626 --> 06:08:37.295
DIFFICULT TIME HIRING YOU

DO NOT MEET MINIMUM HIRING

06:08:42.733 --> 06:08:44.302

06:08:44.368 --> 06:08:46.237
CONSEQUENCE IF THIS LEGISLATION

06:08:46.304 --> 06:08:47.738
FORCED AGENCES TO CHOOSE A

06:08:52.376 --> 06:08:54.245
IMPECCABLE CHARACTER. THIS IS A

06:08:54.312 --> 06:08:56.214
REAL POSSIBILITY ESPECIALLY IN

06:08:56.280 --> 06:08:56.948
LOW PAYING AND RURAL

MINIMUM EDUCATION REQUIREMENT

06:09:05.122 --> 06:09:07.091

OF MINORITY AND FEMALE

06:09:08.025 --> 06:09:09.594

ACCESS TO COLLEGE AS WELL AS

06:09:13.498 --> 06:09:14.899
LOW RETENTION AND GRADUATION

06:09:14.966 --> 06:09:17.268
RATES IN COLLEGE AND THAT DOES

06:09:17.335 --> 06:09:18.769
ADD A NEW BARRIER TO ENTRY

06:09:18.836 --> 06:09:20.705
PEOPLE BY TALK FIRST GENERATION

06:09:20.771 --> 06:09:22.473

THAT REQUIRE A BACHELOR'S

06:09:49.166 --> 06:09:50.935

06:09:51.002 --> 06:09:53.271
SOMETHING LACK BY READING

06:09:53.337 --> 06:09:55.206

THE PERCENT OF COLLEGE EDUCATED

06:10:03.614 --> 06:10:05.116
OFFICERS IN THE DEPARTMENT IS

06:10:05.182 --> 06:10:06.717

GENERALLY MORE EDUCATED THAN

THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS SO IT'S

06:10:18.029 --> 06:10:19.564
UNLIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY A

06:10:19.630 --> 06:10:22.300

06:22:20.250 --> 06:22:21.952
SOLVE IT. AND I FEEL LIKE WE'RE

06:22:22.019 --> 06:22:23.120
LEAVING A BUNCH OF PEOPLE OUT

06:22:23.186 --> 06:22:25.055
OF A CAREER A POTENTIAL CAREER

06:22:25.122 --> 06:22:25.822
FOR THEM BECAUSE A LOT OF

06:22:25.889 --> 06:22:27.557
PEOPLE WILL MAKE. A DECISION

06:22:27.624 --> 06:22:29.326
WHERE THEY WANNA GO LONG BEFORE

06:22:29.393 --> 06:22:31.361
THEY HIT TWENTY FIVE. YES SOME

06:22:31.428 --> 06:22:32.195
OF THEM JUST DON'T WANT TO BE

06:22:32.262 --> 06:22:33.830
AT MOM AND DAD'S HOUSE UNTIL

06:22:33.897 --> 06:22:36.566
THEY'RE TWENTY SIX. AND AND SO

06:22:36.633 --> 06:22:38.435
I CAN IMAGINE THAT THAT THEY'RE

06:22:38.502 --> 06:22:39.469
GONNA GET STARTED SOMEWHERE

06:22:39.536 --> 06:22:42.005
ELSE AND THAT JUST KIND OF

06:22:42.072 --> 06:22:43.974
SHRINKS THAT POOL EVEN MORE- SO

06:22:44.041 --> 06:22:45.309
I GUESS I JUST HAVE A LOT OF

06:22:45.375 --> 06:22:46.643
CONCERNS WITH THAT AND I DON'T

06:22:46.710 --> 06:22:47.778
KNOW IF IT'S THE APPROACH IS

06:22:47.844 --> 06:22:49.246
GOING TO WORK- I'M SURE IT'LL

06:22:49.313 --> 06:22:51.882
GO THROUGH HERE AND- AND- YOU

06:22:51.948 --> 06:22:52.883
KNOW WHAT WE'LL HAVE TO SEE.

06:22:52.949 --> 06:22:56.553
BUT AND ALSO THE LAST THING. I

06:22:56.620 --> 06:22:59.289
CAN THINK OF A LOT. OF NOT

06:22:59.356 --> 06:23:01.158
MISTER PROFESSIONS. BUT

06:23:01.224 --> 06:23:03.026
ENDEAVOR IS THAT PEOPLE ARE IN.

06:23:03.093 --> 06:23:04.728
DEBT AND THEY COULD USE THAT

06:23:04.795 --> 06:23:07.097
THAT HIGHER DEGREE. AND I CAN

06:23:07.164 --> 06:23:08.298
THINK OF A LOT OF INSTANCES

06:23:08.365 --> 06:23:10.334
WHERE PEOPLE HAVE REALLY REALLY

06:23:10.400 --> 06:23:13.337
HIGHER DEGREES. AND STILL MAKE

06:23:13.403 --> 06:23:15.839
BONE HEAD MOVES SO I DON'T

06:23:15.906 --> 06:23:17.974
THINK IT EDUCATION IS THE IS

06:23:18.041 --> 06:23:20.010
NECESSARY THE ANSWER TO- CAN

06:23:20.077 --> 06:23:22.145
MAKING AT WHAT WORK WHAT'S WHAT

06:23:22.212 --> 06:23:24.481
AILS OUR SOCIETY GO AWAY. I

06:23:24.548 --> 06:23:25.982
THINK IT'S A COMPONENT OF IT

06:23:26.049 --> 06:23:28.685
BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE

06:23:28.752 --> 06:23:30.087
INVOLVED IN IT SO. THOSE ARE MY

06:23:30.153 --> 06:23:32.356
COMMENTS THANK YOU MISTER SERRA

06:23:32.422 --> 06:23:36.426
TO. WE HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS.

06:23:36.493 --> 06:23:38.395
I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF WEIGH IN

06:23:38.462 --> 06:23:40.497
ON THIS THIS ISSUE AND I'LL TRY

06:23:40.564 --> 06:23:41.064
TO BE JUST REALLY DIRECTING

06:23:41.131 --> 06:23:45.669
SHORT. I THINK. AS A PERSON WHO

06:23:45.736 --> 06:23:47.471
SPENT THE CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT

06:23:47.537 --> 06:23:49.639
OF TIME MY LIFE IN LAW

06:23:49.706 --> 06:23:52.042
ENFORCEMENT TWENTY EIGHT YEARS.

06:23:52.109 --> 06:23:53.710
I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

06:23:53.777 --> 06:23:54.277
AND WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN

06:23:54.344 --> 06:23:56.813
LOOKING FOR. IS THE HEART OF A

06:23:56.880 --> 06:23:59.116
PUBLIC SERVANT. THAT'S WHAT

06:23:59.182 --> 06:24:01.818
MAKES A GOOD LAW ENFORCEMENT.

06:24:01.885 --> 06:24:04.254
NOT CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE- IN MY

06:24:04.321 --> 06:24:08.291
OPINION LIFE EXPERIENCE HELPS

06:24:08.358 --> 06:24:10.060
DEMONSTRATE WHETHER OR NOT YOU

06:24:10.127 --> 06:24:13.230
HAVE THAT HEART. AND I THINK

06:24:13.296 --> 06:24:14.064
THAT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING

06:24:14.131 --> 06:24:17.434
TO FIND AND I COMMEND YOU FOR.

06:24:17.501 --> 06:24:18.268
TRYING TO APPROVE LAW

06:24:18.335 --> 06:24:20.036
ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE

06:24:20.103 --> 06:24:20.604
THAT'S GENERALLY WHERE YOUR

06:24:20.670 --> 06:24:22.973
HEART IS. BUT I COULDN'T

06:24:23.039 --> 06:24:25.475
DISAGREE MORE. WITH THIS

06:24:25.542 --> 06:24:28.779
