00:21:26.485 --> 00:21:27.886
COMMUNITIES TO ENSURE THAT THAT

00:21:27.953 --> 00:21:30.455
DEFENSE WILL SPACE IS MAINTAINED

00:21:30.522 --> 00:21:31.857
AND CREATES A KIND OF A A

00:21:31.923 --> 00:21:33.659
FINANCIAL STREAM TO MAKE SURE

00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:36.695
THAT THAT CONTINUES ON A

00:21:36.762 --> 00:21:38.096
COMMUNITY WIDE BASIS.

00:21:38.163 --> 00:21:43.135
THIS IS STRUCTURE CREATES A AWAY

00:21:43.201 --> 00:21:45.437
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO LOOK AT

00:21:45.504 --> 00:21:47.472
BUILDING IN THE WILD WILD FIRE

00:21:47.539 --> 00:21:49.007
I'M SORRY WELL THEN URBAN

00:21:49.074 --> 00:21:51.376
INTERFACE AREAS BY PROVING LOCAL

00:21:51.443 --> 00:21:52.277
GOVERNMENTS FROM APPROVING

00:21:52.344 --> 00:21:55.213
PERMITS FOR DEVELOPMENTS UNLESSTHE PROJECT MEETS.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.049
ALL OF THE COMPLIANCE WITH ALL

00:21:57.115 --> 00:21:59.484
THE WILD FIRE RISK REDUCTION

00:21:59.551 --> 00:22:01.653
STANDARDS OUTLINED IN THE BILL --

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.555
WE BELIEVE THAT THAT CREATES --

00:22:03.622 --> 00:22:05.457
BALANCE AND IT IS THERE'S A

00:22:05.524 --> 00:22:07.125
BALANCED LOOK AT THE WAY THESE

00:22:07.192 --> 00:22:08.093
DEVELOPMENTS WORK BY HAVING A

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.829
TIERED STRUCTURE AS THAT SENATOR

00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:11.363
REFERENCE.

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:12.931
NOT ALSO ALL DEVELOPMENTS ARE

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:14.900
TREATED EQUALLY AND THE FIRE

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:17.002
REDUCTION STANDARDS -- DIFFER

00:22:17.069 --> 00:22:19.371
FROM EACH TEAR IF YOU HAVE A

00:22:19.438 --> 00:22:20.472
HUNDRED PLUS DEVELOPMENT THE

00:22:20.539 --> 00:22:21.673
FIRE REDUCTION STANDARDS ARE

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:22.841
GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THAN IF

00:22:22.908 --> 00:22:25.510
YOU HAVE LESS THAN.

00:22:25.577 --> 00:22:27.546
NINE IN THAT DEVELOPMENT.

00:22:27.612 --> 00:22:28.547
THE OTHER THING THAT SB ONE A TO

00:22:28.613 --> 00:22:30.682
ATTEMPT TO DO IS ON SILO THE

00:22:30.749 --> 00:22:33.452
CONVERSATION OF HOUSING NEEDS A

00:22:33.518 --> 00:22:35.687
AND WILD FIRE RISK IN OUR

00:22:35.754 --> 00:22:38.857
COMMUNITIES -- ONE OF THE

00:22:38.924 --> 00:22:41.126
PROVISIONS IN THE BILL SAYS THAT

00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:43.361
ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT THE

00:22:43.428 --> 00:22:44.996
HOUSING ADDS THAT HOUSING HE

00:22:45.063 --> 00:22:47.399
DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT -- AND

00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:48.600
THE COUNCIL GOVERNMENTS NEED TO

00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:51.403
LOOK AT WHEN I'M DOING RIGHT NOW

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.071
ALLOCATION IS.

00:22:53.138 --> 00:22:56.875
IS THE FACTOR OF OF WILDFIRE

00:22:56.942 --> 00:22:58.343
RISK IN THAT AREA.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:22:59.478
NOW I KNOW THAT ONE OF THE

00:22:59.544 --> 00:23:01.713
AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR DID --

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:04.249
TAKING -- THAT THE COMMITTEE HAD

00:23:04.316 --> 00:23:05.884
REQUESTED IS REMOVING THE

00:23:05.951 --> 00:23:07.285
PROVISION THAT ACTUALLY LOWERS

00:23:07.352 --> 00:23:09.421
THE ALLOCATION OF REINA AND SO

00:23:09.488 --> 00:23:10.856
WHAT THIS SAYS WHAT THE BILL

00:23:10.922 --> 00:23:12.257
STILL CONTAINS IS JUST THAT IT

00:23:12.324 --> 00:23:13.625
NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT AS A

00:23:13.692 --> 00:23:14.860
FACTOR.

00:23:14.926 --> 00:23:16.828
AND IN LOOKING AT THE

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:20.866
METHODOLOGY FOR ALLOCATION.

00:23:20.932 --> 00:23:21.433
WE BELIEVE BECAUSE OF THOSE

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:22.367
STATING LOSS OF LIFE AND

00:23:22.434 --> 00:23:23.835
PROPERTY -- BUT HAS HAPPENED

00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:25.470
OVER THE LAST COUPLE FIRE

00:23:25.537 --> 00:23:28.006
SEASONS -- THAT WE REALLY NEED

00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:30.809
TO LOOK AT THE HOUSING NEEDS NOT

00:23:30.876 --> 00:23:32.644
IN THAT SILO LIKE I SAID BUT

00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:34.913
ALSO -- WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.481
WILDFIRE IN THE HOUSING NEEDS

00:23:36.548 --> 00:23:37.482
TOGETHER AND HAVE THAT

00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:38.984
CONVERSATION ESPECIALLY WHEN

00:23:39.050 --> 00:23:40.418
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:23:40.485 --> 00:23:43.955
RE NOT BEING USED AS AS A WAY TO

00:23:44.022 --> 00:23:45.757
TIE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING GOING

00:23:45.824 --> 00:23:47.058

THE FUNDAMENTALS ARE REALLY

00:24:07.078 --> 00:24:07.746
PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD WE NEED

00:24:07.813 --> 00:24:09.948

RISK.

00:24:15.187 --> 00:24:16.621
WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE PROCESS

00:24:16.688 --> 00:24:18.290

SENATOR JACKSON FOR HER

00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:12.177
LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUE WHEN WE

00:25:12.244 --> 00:25:13.511
DON'T HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON

00:25:13.578 --> 00:25:14.512
THE BILL.

00:25:14.579 --> 00:25:15.580
BUT WE DO AGREE WITH THE

00:25:15.647 --> 00:25:16.982
PERSPECTIVE THAT DEVASTATING

00:25:17.048 --> 00:25:23.655
WILDFIRES IN CALIFORNIA -- WE

EXCLUSIVELY FOR EMERGENCY

00:25:34.099 --> 00:25:34.766
PREPAREDNESS WE THINK THAT WE

00:25:34.833 --> 00:25:36.234
NEED TO FIND BOTH COMMUNITY

00:25:36.301 --> 00:25:37.035

RAIN AND WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT

00:25:54.986 --> 00:25:56.288
ABOUT THAT.

00:25:56.354 --> 00:25:57.289
I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

00:25:57.355 --> 00:25:59.624
IS CLARITY WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT

00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:00.992

FOR THAT NUMBER OF HOUSING.

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:08.833
AND IF WE'RE GOING TO CONSTRAIN

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.568
WHERE WE CAN OR CAN'T OR MAKE IT

00:26:10.635 --> 00:26:12.003
MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:13.538
IDENTIFY SITES -- WE MAY NOT BE

ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE NUMBER

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.341
THAT THE STATE IS GIVING US --

UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE IDENTIFIED

00:27:26.878 --> 00:27:28.680
THIS BILL IS A HOUSING KILLER.

00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:31.049
I THINK THE REASONS FOR THAT ARE --

00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:33.618
MULTIPLE I THINK FIRST OF ALL WE

EXISTING LAW AND HELP THOSE

00:27:40.225 --> 00:27:42.060
HOMES AND SUBDIVISIONS SOME

00:27:42.127 --> 00:27:43.461
PROJECTS ARE PERFORMING.

00:27:43.528 --> 00:27:45.597
UNDER THAT EXISTING REGULATORY

00:27:45.663 --> 00:27:48.933
REGIME WE HAVE FOUND THROUGH OUR

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.235
OWN ANALYSIS BUT ALSO.

00:27:50.301 --> 00:27:51.669
ALSO THROUGH -- WHAT'S BEEN

00:27:51.736 --> 00:27:53.772
PRESENTED IN THE PRESS AND OTHER

00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:54.439
MEDIA.

00:27:54.506 --> 00:27:56.241
THAT NEW HOMES ARE THE ONES THAT

00:27:56.307 --> 00:27:57.809
HAVE THE HIGHEST RESISTANCE TO

00:27:57.876 --> 00:28:00.779
WILDFIRES THEY ARE IN FACT DOING

00:28:00.845 --> 00:28:01.746
THEIR JOB.

00:28:01.813 --> 00:28:05.183
AND IT'S THE EXISTING POPULATION

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:08.219
HAS THE BIGGEST RISKS OF

00:28:08.286 --> 00:28:10.989
WILDFIRE -- WE SAW THAT BOTH IN

00:28:11.056 --> 00:28:13.158
THE THOMAS FIRE AND HOW THAT

00:28:13.224 --> 00:28:15.326
AFFECTED HOMES IN.

00:28:15.393 --> 00:28:17.062
THE CITY OF VENTURA HOW THAT

00:28:17.128 --> 00:28:18.963
AFFECTED THE SANTA ROSA AREA

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:21.032
COFFEE PARK THESE ARE IN FILL

00:28:21.099 --> 00:28:23.668
AREAS THESE ARE NOT JUST WHERE

00:28:23.735 --> 00:28:26.071
YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

00:28:26.137 --> 00:28:28.573
WE WE FOR MORE PERSPECTIVE WE

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.075
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THIS

00:28:30.141 --> 00:28:31.009
BILL AND SAY.

00:28:31.076 --> 00:28:33.478
WE'RE TO SUPPLY AND WHAT WE HAVE

00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:37.148
TO DO IN THOSE AREAS SO -- IF WE

00:28:37.215 --> 00:28:39.384
CAN'T GET OUR HANDS AROUND THAT

00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:41.586
AND THEN IT'S REALLY FOR US THE

00:28:41.653 --> 00:28:43.221
RISK OF PLAYING GOTCHA WITH

00:28:43.288 --> 00:28:44.355
APPROVALS.

00:28:44.422 --> 00:28:46.391
AND FOR US THE HIGHEST FIRE RISK

00:28:46.458 --> 00:28:47.926
AREAS OF THOSE VERY HIGH FIRE

00:28:47.992 --> 00:28:50.028
HAZARD SEVERITY SOUNDS WE'RE

00:28:50.095 --> 00:28:51.196
FAMILIAR WITH THAT THAT'S MAPPED

00:28:51.262 --> 00:28:53.765
THAT SET BY STATE AGENCIES WE

00:28:53.832 --> 00:28:54.365
KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH IT IT'S

00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:57.802
UPDATED REGULARLY AND SO WE KNOW.

00:28:57.869 --> 00:28:59.671
WHERE THOSE AREAS ARE BUT IN

00:28:59.737 --> 00:29:01.539
ADDITION TO THAT THERE ARE OTHER

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:02.941
AREAS ADDITIONAL AREAS THAT ARE

00:29:03.007 --> 00:29:05.510
NOT FOUND IN THOSE HIGH FIRE

00:29:05.577 --> 00:29:06.678
HAZARD SEVERITY ZONES?

00:29:06.744 --> 00:29:09.080
ADDED TO THAT YOU CAN SEE THIS

00:29:09.147 --> 00:29:10.748
IN THE DEFINITIONS THERE IN THE

00:29:10.815 --> 00:29:11.583
BILL.

00:29:11.649 --> 00:29:18.356
THIS IS ANY AREA WHERE STRUCTURE

00:29:18.423 --> 00:29:20.024
INTERMINGLED WITH BUDGET.

00:29:20.091 --> 00:29:21.659
THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS THAT

00:29:21.726 --> 00:29:23.128
MEANS THAT IN ANY AREA WHERE

00:29:23.194 --> 00:29:24.929
THERE ARE TREES THERE BUSH'S

00:29:24.996 --> 00:29:25.930
THERE'S GRASS WITH THE YOU HAVE.

00:29:25.997 --> 00:29:27.699
PARKS OR YOU HAVE AN URBAN

00:29:27.765 --> 00:29:28.333
INFILL AREAS IN AREAS LIKE

00:29:28.399 --> 00:29:29.067
SACRAMENTO AND IN ALL OF YOUR

00:29:29.134 --> 00:29:31.102
COMMUNITIES WHO HAVE THESE AREAS.

00:29:31.169 --> 00:29:32.737
WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD HIGH

00:29:32.804 --> 00:29:35.440
DENSITY MULTI FAMILY HOUSING?

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:38.710
NOW WE HAVE A NEW -- OBSTACLE TO

00:29:38.776 --> 00:29:41.513
NEGOTIATE WITH A NEW REASON FOR

00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:43.848
US TO HAVE OUR PROJECTS DENIED I

00:29:43.915 --> 00:29:45.316
THINK THAT THE BILL AS IT EXISTS

00:29:45.383 --> 00:29:46.885
IS OVERBROAD.

00:29:46.951 --> 00:29:48.319
I THINK THAT.

00:29:48.386 --> 00:29:49.654
YOU HAVE TO APPROACH THIS ISSUE

00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:51.856
LIKE YOU DO EVERY OTHER ISSUE

00:29:51.923 --> 00:29:53.558
WHICH IS THERE'S NO PERFECT

00:29:53.625 --> 00:29:55.894
PLACE TO BUILDING CALIFORNIA FOR

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.561
SOME.

00:29:56.628 --> 00:30:02.267
IT'S WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE --

00:30:02.333 --> 00:30:02.901
DISPLACEMENT WE DON'T WANT HAVE

00:30:02.967 --> 00:30:03.568
GENTRIFICATION WE DON'T WANT TO

00:30:03.635 --> 00:30:05.803
HAVE SEISMIC CARESS WE DON'T

00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:06.671
WANT TO HAVE.

00:30:06.738 --> 00:30:09.174
THE SEA LEVEL RISE OR WETLANDS

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.009
OR AG LAND PRESERVATION OR

00:30:11.075 --> 00:30:15.180
FLOODS OR TOXICS FOR YOU NAME IT

00:30:15.246 --> 00:30:17.148
WHATEVER THE THE THE PARTICULAR

00:30:17.215 --> 00:30:18.383
INTEREST IS.

00:30:18.449 --> 00:30:19.918
THAT'S THE REASON FOR OBJECTING

00:30:19.984 --> 00:30:22.353
TO HOUSING IN EVERY PLACE THE

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:25.690
ENTIRE STATE IS COVERED WITH.

00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:27.492
HAVING IN PERFECT PLACES TO

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:29.527
BUILD AND SO DON'T MAKE THE

00:30:29.594 --> 00:30:32.063
PERFECT THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:35.300
THAT'S HOW WE GOT INTO THIS MESS

00:30:35.366 --> 00:30:37.035
IN TERMS OF A HOUSING CRISIS WE

00:30:37.101 --> 00:30:38.970
NEED TO BE ABLE TO CREATE A

00:30:39.037 --> 00:30:40.371
PATHWAY FOR HOUSING.

00:30:40.438 --> 00:30:42.373
SO MUCH FOR THE PLACES WHERE IT

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:43.675
MIGHT APPLY.

00:30:43.741 --> 00:30:44.776
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IN THOSE

00:30:44.842 --> 00:30:47.145
AREAS I CAN TELL YOU AS A LAND

00:30:47.212 --> 00:30:49.447
USE AN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWYER FOR

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:51.349
TWENTY SIX YEARS I CAN'T TELL?

00:30:51.416 --> 00:30:53.017
WE'VE SINCE THAT SINCE I

00:30:53.084 --> 00:30:55.486
COULDN'T TELL I IN BUT WE WENT

00:30:55.553 --> 00:30:56.955
OUT AND TALKED TO EXPERTS.

00:30:57.021 --> 00:30:58.823
THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO TELL US WHAT

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:00.792
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO WE

00:31:00.858 --> 00:31:02.093
NEED TO KNOW FROM A PLANNING A

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:03.761
DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION

00:31:03.828 --> 00:31:09.033
PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:10.301
NEED TO DO IN THOSE AREAS. ONE

00:31:10.368 --> 00:31:11.135
OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WAS TAKEN

00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:12.136
IN SENATE GOVERNANCE OF FINANCE

00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:13.738
PROVIDED SOME.

00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:16.374
THE SIDE BOARDS TO WHAT MIGHT BE

00:31:16.441 --> 00:31:18.076
IMPOSED ARE PROJECTS.

00:31:18.142 --> 00:31:19.744
IT WILL ONLY APPLY ONLY APPLIES

00:31:19.811 --> 00:31:21.579
TO THE SMALL DEVELOPMENTS NINE

00:31:21.646 --> 00:31:23.181
HOMES ARE FEWER.

00:31:23.248 --> 00:31:25.516
HERE'S WHAT IT IS.

00:31:25.583 --> 00:31:27.051
THEY HAVE TO BE REASONABLE.

00:31:27.118 --> 00:31:30.355
FEASIBLE AND THE CHIEF OF ALL.

00:31:30.421 --> 00:31:32.490
IF THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR NINE

00:31:32.557 --> 00:31:34.525
HOMES IT SHOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH

00:31:34.592 --> 00:31:37.695
FOR ANY PROJECT WE SET LIMITS ON

00:31:37.762 --> 00:31:38.896
HOW WE DEAL WITH CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:31:38.963 --> 00:31:40.765
WE DEVELOP A SUSTAINABLE

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:43.601
COMMUNITY STRATEGIES THEY HAVE

00:31:43.668 --> 00:31:44.969
TO BE ACHIEVABLE.

00:31:45.036 --> 00:31:46.504
NOW WE'RE SAYING EVEN IF THEY'RE

00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:48.139
NOT ACHIEVABLE EVEN IF THEY'RE

00:31:48.206 --> 00:31:49.641
NOT FEASIBLE EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT

00:31:49.707 --> 00:31:51.142
REASONABLE.

00:31:51.209 --> 00:31:52.143
WE SHOULD BE ALLOWED OPPOSE

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:55.546
THOSE ON NEW HOUSING PROJECTS.

00:31:55.613 --> 00:31:57.015
WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS.

00:31:57.081 --> 00:31:59.817
IF YOU WANT TO PLAY GOTCHA THEN

00:31:59.884 --> 00:32:01.753
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

00:32:01.819 --> 00:32:04.956
SO WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE ASKING

00:32:05.023 --> 00:32:07.425
FOR AT THIS POINT IS. TO MAKE

00:32:07.492 --> 00:32:10.295
PROVIDES SOME LIMITATIONS ON

00:32:10.361 --> 00:32:11.195
THOSE.

00:32:11.262 --> 00:32:12.630
THOSE REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL BE

00:32:12.697 --> 00:32:15.667
IMPOSED ON US EVEN THOUGH WE

00:32:15.733 --> 00:32:16.734
CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY ARE.

00:32:16.801 --> 00:32:18.303
JUST SOME LIMITATION TO PROVIDE

00:32:18.369 --> 00:32:20.538
THAT BALANCE THAT WE NEED.

00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:21.906
OTHERWISE IT'S JUST A NO HOUSING

00:32:21.973 --> 00:32:24.709
BILL.

00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:25.243
I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.511
QUESTIONS.

00:32:26.577 --> 00:32:27.545
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:32:27.612 --> 00:32:29.314
IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:31.482
OPPOSITION TO THE BILL.

00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:32.750
OKAY SIGNAL BRING ABOUT THE

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:33.885
COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES ANY

00:32:33.951 --> 00:32:35.286
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER

00:32:35.353 --> 00:32:37.955
LIKE HEALTHY.

00:32:38.022 --> 00:32:39.891
ON THE HARDENING OF THE EXISTING

00:32:39.957 --> 00:32:41.626
STRUCTURES AND THE HOMEOWNERS

00:32:41.693 --> 00:32:43.494
ASSOCIATIONS NORMALLY THEY

00:32:43.561 --> 00:32:45.530
ASSESS IF THEY'RE IN THE IF

00:32:45.596 --> 00:32:49.067
THEY'RE IN THE HIGH -- FIREFIGHT --

00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:50.134
AREA I I PREDICT PRISON THIRST

00:32:50.201 --> 00:32:52.170
WAS TO MEET NEW EXCEED BILL A

00:32:52.236 --> 00:32:54.872
CLASS B. STANDARDS TO HARDEN

00:32:54.939 --> 00:32:59.944
THEIR ASSETS SOME WONDERING IS

00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:02.146
THAT A HOMEOWNER.

00:33:02.213 --> 00:33:02.714
PAYMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO DO

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.549
THAT THE TO IMPROVE DEBTORS AT

00:33:04.615 --> 00:33:06.217
HERE IS A ANTICIPATION THAT IT'S

00:33:06.284 --> 00:33:08.019
PART OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS FUNDS

00:33:08.086 --> 00:33:09.320
FOR FUNDING THIS I DON'T KNOW AT

00:33:09.387 --> 00:33:10.822
THIS POINT IF WE'VE TOTALLY

00:33:10.888 --> 00:33:12.390
IDENTIFIED THE SOURCES OF

00:33:12.457 --> 00:33:13.858
FUNDING.

00:33:13.925 --> 00:33:17.495
THAT WILL BE USED FOR THIS --

00:33:17.562 --> 00:33:19.864
BUT WHAT WERE TRUE WHAT WE'RE

00:33:19.931 --> 00:33:23.101
TRYING TO DO AND I WAS LISTENING.

00:33:23.167 --> 00:33:25.536
TO BUILDING INDUSTRIES HOUSING

00:33:25.603 --> 00:33:27.672
KILLER TO NEW PHRASE TO ME I

00:33:27.739 --> 00:33:30.608
KNOW THE CHAMBER LIKE JOB KILLER.

00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:32.443
NUMBER CLINCH BUT I'M REALLY NOT

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:34.045
SURE EVEN UNDERSTOOD WHAT HE WAS.

00:33:34.112 --> 00:33:36.514
COMPLAINING ABOUT HER BUT BUT I

00:33:36.581 --> 00:33:37.849
THINK WHAT WE HAVE IS A

00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:40.318
SITUATION WHERE WE ARE TRYING.

00:33:40.385 --> 00:33:43.287
TO IDENTIFY THOSE RISK AREAS.

00:33:43.354 --> 00:33:44.956
AND BY THE WAY SACRAMENTO UNDER

00:33:45.022 --> 00:33:46.991
NO CIRCUMSTANCES EVEN ONE'S

00:33:47.058 --> 00:33:49.160
WILDEST IMAGINATION WITH ANYONE

00:33:49.227 --> 00:33:50.695
CALL IT A WEEK.

00:33:50.762 --> 00:33:53.264
WHO IS IN LAGUNA MIGUEL OR WHERE

00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:56.067
THE MOUNTAINS COME DOWN TO THE

00:33:56.134 --> 00:33:57.835
HILLS THE COME DOWN? TO TO THE

00:33:57.902 --> 00:33:59.170
YEAR IT TO THE BEACH AREAS SO

00:33:59.237 --> 00:34:00.605
SINCE THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:34:00.671 --> 00:34:03.508
PRIMARILY OF THE BERKELEY HILLS.

00:34:03.574 --> 00:34:05.743
SACRAMENTO LAST I LOOKED AT HIM

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:07.011
FONG TOO MANY HILLS THERE'S NO

00:34:07.078 --> 00:34:11.282
MOVIE HERE SO THOSE.

00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:13.084
ARGUMENTS JUST REALLY.

00:34:13.151 --> 00:34:14.752
DON'T HOLD WATER -- WHAT WE'RE

00:34:14.819 --> 00:34:16.487
TRYING TO DO IS IDENTIFY THOSE

00:34:16.554 --> 00:34:18.589
AREAS WHICH ARE AT HIGH RISK AND

00:34:18.656 --> 00:34:20.925
MAKE SURE THAT IN THOSE AREAS WE

00:34:20.992 --> 00:34:22.960
HARDEN THAT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

00:34:23.027 --> 00:34:24.328
LOCAL COMMUNITIES?

00:34:24.395 --> 00:34:26.497
WILL MAKE IT CLEAR WHAT IT IS

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:28.499
SAID TO EXPECTED WHAT IS

00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:30.234
REQUIRED GIVEN THE FACT THAT

00:34:30.301 --> 00:34:32.136
WE'RE NOW SEEING THESE FIRES

00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:33.571
HAPPENING IN DECEMBER.

00:34:33.638 --> 00:34:35.339
BURNING AT SIXTEEN HUNDRED

00:34:35.406 --> 00:34:36.641
DEGREES THINGS THAT WE NEVER HAD

00:34:36.707 --> 00:34:38.709
TO DEAL WITH BEFORE AND SO AS WE

00:34:38.776 --> 00:34:41.045
BUILD WHETHER IT'S NEW HOUSING

00:34:41.112 --> 00:34:42.780
WELL WE TRY TO HARDEN EXISTING

00:34:42.847 --> 00:34:43.581
HOUSING.

00:34:43.648 --> 00:34:45.783
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS BRING

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.819
TOGETHER?

00:34:47.885 --> 00:34:50.621
THE PLANNING -- AGENCIES

00:34:50.688 --> 00:34:52.490
THROUGHOUT LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND

00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:54.559
REQUIRING THAT THEY ASSESS THIS

00:34:54.625 --> 00:34:57.628
ISSUE AND CREATE THE STANDARDS

00:34:57.695 --> 00:34:59.330
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO REQUIRE.

00:34:59.397 --> 00:35:02.800
THOSE WHO LIVE IN THOSE AREAS.

00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:05.903
TO TO DEVELOP IN ORDER TO DEAL.

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:08.806
WITH THE REALITIES OF THE ALL OF

00:35:08.873 --> 00:35:10.908
THE POTENTIAL FIRE SO AS FAR AS

00:35:10.975 --> 00:35:13.044
THE FUNDING MECHANISM GOES WE

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:14.812
HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T QUITE BEEN

00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:15.880
ABLE.

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:16.848
TO WORK THAT OUT I KNOW THE

00:35:16.914 --> 00:35:18.983
GOVERNOR IS PUT MONEY IN THE

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.152
BUDGET FOR ADDRESSING THESE

00:35:21.219 --> 00:35:25.389
WILDFIRES AND THIS IS AN AREA.

00:35:25.456 --> 00:35:27.158
THAT HAS BEEN LEFT.

00:35:27.225 --> 00:35:28.159
BUT THERE'S A VOID IN THIS AREA

00:35:28.226 --> 00:35:28.426
PLANNING.

00:35:28.493 --> 00:35:30.228
AND WHAT WE ARE DOING INDEED IS

00:35:30.294 --> 00:35:31.863
TALKING TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES

00:35:31.929 --> 00:35:33.030

WE CAN'T ADJUST TO PRESCRIBE

00:35:39.837 --> 00:35:41.072
BURNS WE CAN'T DO THE THINGS

00:35:41.138 --> 00:35:42.974
THAT WE IN LEGISLATION WE DID

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:44.175
LAST YEAR THAT'S PART OF THE

00:35:44.242 --> 00:35:45.643
ANSWER BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:46.978

AND TAKING THE NECESSARY STEPS

00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:51.682

PROTECT HMAN LIFE.

00:35:53.284 --> 00:35:55.119

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:12.470
THE OF THE AT ALL CORRECT BUT

00:36:12.537 --> 00:36:14.438
THERE'S SOME OF THE I GUESS

00:36:14.505 --> 00:36:16.941
COMMON AREAS THAT ARE THAT ARE

THOSE -- HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION

00:36:30.321 --> 00:36:32.290
IMPROVEMENTS IN A FIFTY DECIDED

00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:33.691
IF THEY MAKE THE STEP THAT

THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT THAT'S I

00:36:34.492 --> 00:36:36.561
DON'T EXPECT AN ANSWER HERE BUT

I I SEE THE GOOD PART IS SAID.

00:36:39.063 --> 00:36:40.264
IF YOU HAVE ONE OF THE SEVENTY

00:36:40.331 --> 00:36:41.799

00:36:49.774 --> 00:36:51.342
NOWADAYS SO I ASSUME THAT

00:36:51.409 --> 00:36:53.477
CORRECT SET WELL AGE IT'S

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:54.645
DESIGNED TO I MEAN WE'RE TRIP A

00:36:54.712 --> 00:36:55.913
LOT OF WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.415
IS WHAT DO I DO TO PROTECT MY

00:36:57.481 --> 00:36:58.182
HOME.

00:36:58.249 --> 00:37:00.851
IN CASE OF A WILDFIRE IN ANOTHER

00:37:00.918 --> 00:37:03.120
ELEMENT BY THE WAY WHICH WILL

00:37:03.187 --> 00:37:06.290
FURTHER INCENTIVIZE SIS IS

00:37:06.357 --> 00:37:07.258
TRYING TO GET INSURANCE.

00:37:07.325 --> 00:37:08.225
WHEN YOU LIVE IN A HIGH FIRE

00:37:08.292 --> 00:37:11.462
AREA AND HAS SO I WAS JUST TWO

00:37:11.529 --> 00:37:14.432
MONTHS AGO NON RENEWED -- FOR

00:37:14.498 --> 00:37:16.100
INSURANCE AND WE HAD TO GO OUT

00:37:16.167 --> 00:37:17.435
AND THE COST OF THAT NEW

00:37:17.501 --> 00:37:18.769
INSURANCE.

00:37:18.836 --> 00:37:20.104
BECOMES.

00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:21.839
A CHALLENGE BUT THE INSURANCE

00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:23.975
INDUSTRY TO SAY YOU NEED TO DO

00:37:24.041 --> 00:37:25.676
A. B. C. AND D..

00:37:25.743 --> 00:37:27.578
IF YOU WANT TO OUR INSURANCE AND

00:37:27.645 --> 00:37:29.780
EVEN THEN AGAIN WITHOUT TAKING

00:37:29.847 --> 00:37:31.749
THOSE MITIGATION MEASURES GIVEN

00:37:31.816 --> 00:37:33.517
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE THOUSANDS

00:37:33.584 --> 00:37:35.653
OF HOMES THAT HAVE BEEN LOST AND

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.922
THE ENORMOUS COST. TO EVERYBODY

00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:40.057
THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY PROBABLY

00:37:40.124 --> 00:37:41.626
P. JEANNIE AND OTHERS IS SUCH

00:37:41.692 --> 00:37:43.527
THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:37:43.594 --> 00:37:45.363
TAKE SOME OF THAT RESPONSIBILITY

00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:46.564
SO I'M ASSUMING THE HOMEOWNERS

00:37:46.631 --> 00:37:47.698
ASSOCIATION.

00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:49.667
WE'LL GET OFF THE YOU KNOW WE'LL

00:37:49.734 --> 00:37:51.102
GET ON BOARD AS WELL JUST

00:37:51.168 --> 00:37:53.604
BECAUSE THE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED

00:37:53.671 --> 00:37:55.706
WITH NOT DOING THAT WORK WILL BE

00:37:55.773 --> 00:37:57.642
SIGNIFICANT. ONE WOULD HOPE AND

00:37:57.708 --> 00:37:58.609
I MISTER CHAIR ONE FINAL

00:37:58.676 --> 00:38:00.645
QUESTION THE STAFF REPORT AT

00:38:00.711 --> 00:38:02.446
PAGE FOUR IS TALKING ABOUT THE

00:38:02.513 --> 00:38:05.783
VERY HIGH FIRE SEVERITY SOUNDS.

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:06.817
FIRST WHICH I ASSUME ARE

00:38:06.884 --> 00:38:09.587
DIFFERENT FROM THE HI FIRES

00:38:09.654 --> 00:38:12.023
ZONES VERSUS THE JUST THE FIRE

00:38:12.089 --> 00:38:16.861
SEVERITY SO AND SO ARE WE IS

00:38:16.927 --> 00:38:18.295
THAT.

00:38:18.362 --> 00:38:19.363
WHAT TYPE OF UNIVERSES THAT WELL

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:21.232
UNFORTUNATELY -- THEY THE THE

00:38:21.298 --> 00:38:24.035
MAPS HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE

00:38:24.101 --> 00:38:25.636
I THINK IT'S TWO THOUSAND AND

00:38:25.703 --> 00:38:28.139
FOUR I AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE

00:38:28.205 --> 00:38:29.140
AREAS.

00:38:29.206 --> 00:38:30.741
GIVEN THE CHANGING WEATHER

00:38:30.808 --> 00:38:32.977
PATTERNS GIVING GIVEN THE FACT

00:38:33.044 --> 00:38:34.679
THAT WE'VE HAD DROUGHT THAT

00:38:34.745 --> 00:38:36.180
THOSE NEED TO BE DRAMATICALLY

00:38:36.247 --> 00:38:38.282
NEED TO BE UPDATED AND UPGRADED

00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:41.252
BECAUSE YES THE THE STATE OF

00:38:41.318 --> 00:38:42.019
CALIFORNIA.

00:38:42.086 --> 00:38:43.254
WE CAN WHAT'S A CHALLENGE ANYWAY

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.755
BETWEEN EARTHQUAKES AND WHAT

00:38:44.822 --> 00:38:46.190
HAVE YOU BUT SOME AREAS ARE

00:38:46.257 --> 00:38:48.926
CLEARLY MORE PRONE. TO PROBLEMS

00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:51.195
IN THE MOVIES ARE THOSE AREAS.

00:38:51.262 --> 00:38:52.797
IF YOU JUST LIVE ANYWHERE.

00:38:52.863 --> 00:38:54.732
NEAR THE WILDLIFE URBAN

00:38:54.799 --> 00:38:57.234
INTERFACE -- YOU ARE YOU ARE

00:38:57.301 --> 00:38:58.936
SHOULD MORE SUSCEPTIBLE AS

00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:00.371
COMPARED TO THE CITY OF

00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:02.573
SACRAMENTO WHICH IS.

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.408
NOT IN A WEEK.

00:39:04.475 --> 00:39:06.243
YOU SEE MY CONCERN IS YES JUST

00:39:06.310 --> 00:39:08.012
TO DO A MOVIE VERSUS THE VERY

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:08.879
SAYS.

00:39:08.946 --> 00:39:10.548
SUPPORT SUPER HIGH -- AREAS ON

00:39:10.614 --> 00:39:14.885
THESE COMMON INTEREST

00:39:14.952 --> 00:39:16.187
DEVELOPMENT I DON'T WANT.

00:39:16.253 --> 00:39:17.588
TO WELL PART OF IT PART OF IT IS

00:39:17.655 --> 00:39:18.823
WE NEED NO ONE'S BEEN DOING ANY

00:39:18.889 --> 00:39:21.158
PLANNING -- AND SO THIS IS GOING

00:39:21.225 --> 00:39:21.759
TO GET US TO DO THE PLANNING

00:39:21.826 --> 00:39:22.927
FISH ARE BELIEVED BENEFITS

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:25.229
EVERYBODY I EVEN THINK IT

00:39:25.296 --> 00:39:25.963
BENEFITS THE BUILDING INDUSTRY

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.532
BUT YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE PERSON'S

00:39:28.599 --> 00:39:30.868
MEETS ANOTHER PERSON'S POTATO

00:39:30.935 --> 00:39:32.269
SEVERAL.

00:39:32.336 --> 00:39:33.704
GIVE A UP.

00:39:33.771 --> 00:39:35.873
A POTENTIAL NUMBER OF RESIDENTS

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:39.443
THIS WILL -- AFFECT.

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:42.680
AT THIS TIME -- OR POTENTIALLY

00:39:42.747 --> 00:39:46.450
HOW MANY -- POTENTIAL BUILDINGS --

00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:49.520
PROJECTS WILL AFFECT WILL AREAS

00:39:49.587 --> 00:39:50.354
I SHOULD SAY -- WE'RE LOOKING

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:52.890
MORE TO ADD GEOGRAPHY HOW MANY

00:39:52.957 --> 00:39:54.692
HOW MANY AREAS ARE THERE IN THE

00:39:54.759 --> 00:39:56.861
STATE LIKE AT THAT HAVE LOUISE

00:39:56.927 --> 00:40:00.297
BE OUR SQUARE MILES GIVES THEM.

00:40:00.364 --> 00:40:01.265
HAVE YOU ARE YOU HAVEN'T GOTTEN

00:40:01.332 --> 00:40:02.767
THAT FAR THEN I TAKE A I DON'T

00:40:02.833 --> 00:40:07.371
HAVE THAT NUMBER OKAY OKAY

00:40:07.438 --> 00:40:07.671
[inaudible]

00:40:07.738 --> 00:40:10.007
BOERNER HORVATH.

00:40:10.074 --> 00:40:11.976
A YOUNG FIVE ACTUALLY LIVE I

00:40:12.042 --> 00:40:13.410
THINK ANY LAWYER SOMETHING CLOSE

00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:14.378
TO THAT AND ARE HOMEOWNERS

00:40:14.445 --> 00:40:15.946
ASSOCIATION IS REQUIRED BY THE

00:40:16.013 --> 00:40:17.681
FIRE AT THE READY. TO DO CERTAIN

00:40:17.748 --> 00:40:18.916
THINGS WITCHER'S FUEL

00:40:18.983 --> 00:40:20.284
MODIFICATION WE HAVE A WHOLE

00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:22.419
PLAN ON THE BACK PART OF OUR

00:40:22.486 --> 00:40:24.288
HOME AND WE LIVED A. G. SENT TO

00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:25.356
THE CANYON.

00:40:25.422 --> 00:40:26.490
THAT THANK GOODNESS FOR THE

00:40:26.557 --> 00:40:28.259
CANYON OF STOP THE LAGUNA FIRES

00:40:28.325 --> 00:40:29.527
FROM LEAPING THE CANYON COMING

00:40:29.593 --> 00:40:30.661
OVER SO.

00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:32.163
THE IDEAS ARE GOOD AT I JUST

00:40:32.229 --> 00:40:33.297
WONDER WHY YOU WOULD BE

00:40:33.364 --> 00:40:35.132
RESISTANT TO TAKING THEY

00:40:35.199 --> 00:40:35.800
AMENDMENT.

00:40:35.866 --> 00:40:37.802
THAT'S BEEN SUGGESTED BY A ON

00:40:37.868 --> 00:40:41.372
THE B. I A THAT IS REASONABLE.

00:40:41.438 --> 00:40:43.340
FEASIBLE -- FORGET THE OTHER

00:40:43.407 --> 00:40:44.975
TURN THE REASON BEING LOCAL

00:40:45.042 --> 00:40:46.343
GOVERNMENTS ARE VERY GOOD AT

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:49.280
USING THAT DISCRETION TO PROTECT.

00:40:49.346 --> 00:40:50.981
THOSE HOMES IN THEIR AREA AND I

00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:53.117
I THINK MY HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION

00:40:53.184 --> 00:40:55.553
AN ORANGE COUNTY IN PARTICULAR.

00:40:55.619 --> 00:40:56.387
HAS BEEN VERY DILIGENT IN MATH

00:40:56.453 --> 00:40:58.322
BUT TO MAKE IT SO RESTRICTIVE

00:40:58.389 --> 00:40:59.523
FOR THE LARGER DEVELOPMENTS I

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:01.992
THINK THE I A HAS A GOOD POINT.

00:41:02.059 --> 00:41:05.496
THAT WE START TO TO NARAL -- THE

00:41:05.563 --> 00:41:07.398
OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE THERE FOR

00:41:07.464 --> 00:41:09.533
BUILDING DURING THE HOUSING

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.668
CRISIS.

00:41:10.734 --> 00:41:12.403
BEYOND -- DOUBT THAT TROUBLES ME

00:41:12.469 --> 00:41:15.239
BECAUSE WE'VE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:16.507
TO DO WHAT.

00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:18.576
IS BEING REQUIRED IN THE US.

00:41:18.642 --> 00:41:20.010
AND THE NEWER DEVELOPMENTS SEE

00:41:20.077 --> 00:41:22.346
IN OUR COMMUNITY AND ALLOWING

00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:24.048
THAT SORT OF DISCRETION THAT'S

00:41:24.114 --> 00:41:25.482
MENTIONED IN LET ME GET THE

00:41:25.549 --> 00:41:27.618
TERMINOLOGY CORRECT IT SAYS.

00:41:27.685 --> 00:41:29.253
REASONABLE FEASIBLE AND

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.055
ACHIEVABLE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT

00:41:31.121 --> 00:41:33.390
HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPLIED -- FOR

00:41:33.457 --> 00:41:34.925
MANY OF THE HOMES THAT WERE

00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:36.594
BUILT IN REMEMBER IN ORANGE

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.195
COUNTY WE HAVE TWO MAJOR

00:41:38.262 --> 00:41:39.363
DEVELOPMENTS.

00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:41.899
RANCHO MISSION VIEJO AND THEN WE

00:41:41.966 --> 00:41:44.268
HAVE -- FORSTER RANCH AND THEN

00:41:44.335 --> 00:41:45.469
THERE'S ONE IN ON THE LAKE

00:41:45.536 --> 00:41:47.004
FOREST WHERE BY THE WAY THE

00:41:47.071 --> 00:41:48.973
FIRES AN ORANGE COUNTY DURING ON

00:41:49.039 --> 00:41:51.242
THE MID TWO THOUSANDS CAME OVER.

00:41:51.308 --> 00:41:53.377
THOSE CANYONS BUT AGAIN THOSE

00:41:53.444 --> 00:41:54.612
HOUSES WERE HARD.

00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:56.480
SO YOU HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:41:56.547 --> 00:41:58.015
ARE ALREADY DOING IT IN GOING

00:41:58.082 --> 00:42:00.184
FORWARD IT WOULD SEEM TO ME YOU

00:42:00.251 --> 00:42:01.552
WANT TO PROVIDE.

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:03.120
MORE DISCRETION TO GET THOSE

00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:12.763
LARGER DEVELOPMENTS ESPECIALLY

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:14.465
IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE ATTACHED --

00:42:14.531 --> 00:42:16.667
MULTI FAMILY IS WHAT WE'RE

00:42:16.734 --> 00:42:17.401
LOOKING FOR OUR DEATHS SO I I'M

00:42:17.468 --> 00:42:18.469
I GUESS MY MY QUESTION IS MORE

00:42:18.535 --> 00:42:19.470
OF A STATEMENT SENATOR JACKSON.

00:42:19.536 --> 00:42:20.738
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND MAYBE

00:42:20.804 --> 00:42:21.605
CONSIDER THAT OUT FOR THE LARGER

00:42:21.672 --> 00:42:22.373
DEVELOPMENTS BECAUSE I THINK IT

00:42:22.439 --> 00:42:23.474
CAN BE ACHIEVED.

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:24.541
OUR I'VE JUST SEEN IT HAPPEN

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:25.676
THEN WE WENT THROUGH SOME PRETTY

00:42:25.743 --> 00:42:26.810
SIGNIFICANT.

00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:28.112
OUR TIME IS AN ORANGE COUNTY

00:42:28.178 --> 00:42:29.246
DURING MY ROLE ON THE BOARD OF

00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:31.081
SUPERVISORS IT WAS IN MY

00:42:31.148 --> 00:42:32.716
DISTRICT AND I THINK SOME OF US

00:42:32.783 --> 00:42:34.585
SENATOR MORE WALKS ARE COMING

00:42:34.652 --> 00:42:37.354
DOWN. TO IRVINE SO I TAKE A LOOK

00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:40.224
AT THAT I THINK TODAY I'M GOING --

00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:41.959
TO OPPOSE THE BILL JUST TO PUT

00:42:42.026 --> 00:42:43.694
MORE PRESSURE TO TAKE A LOOK AT

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:44.361
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A

00:42:44.428 --> 00:42:46.096
REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR

00:42:46.163 --> 00:42:48.232
LARGER DEVELOPMENT SO WHAT WE

00:42:48.299 --> 00:42:49.500
HAVE DONE THE BILL.

00:42:49.566 --> 00:42:51.468
RELIES ON CONSENSUS NATIONAL AND

00:42:51.535 --> 00:42:54.605
STATE ADVISORY STANDARDS. FOR A

00:42:54.672 --> 00:42:57.274
PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL THE OFFICE

00:42:57.341 --> 00:42:58.509
OF STATE FIRE MARSHAL.

00:42:58.575 --> 00:42:59.977
PROMULGATES APPROPRIATE

00:43:00.044 --> 00:43:01.745
STANDARDS WE WANT TO LOOK AT THE

00:43:01.812 --> 00:43:05.416
REAL EXPERTS TO DECIDE AND AND

00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:06.984
TO CREATE THE STANDARDS.

00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:08.919
AND THEY WILL BE CONSENSUS

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:11.855
ADVISORY STANDARDS -- WHICH WILL

00:43:11.922 --> 00:43:12.990
RELY.

00:43:13.057 --> 00:43:14.892
ON SIGNIFICANT INPUT FROM ISSUE

00:43:14.959 --> 00:43:17.528
EXPERTS SO WE WERE DECISION PIE

00:43:17.594 --> 00:43:18.729
IN THE SKY THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:43:18.796 --> 00:43:21.131
TAKE THE AND AND USE THE BEST

00:43:21.198 --> 00:43:23.767
EXPERTS TO TRY -- TO ESTABLISH

00:43:23.834 --> 00:43:25.536
THOSE STANDARDS AND LOCAL

00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:27.438
GOVERNMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THIS

00:43:27.504 --> 00:43:28.472
I MEAN THIS IS PART OF THEIR

00:43:28.539 --> 00:43:29.473
PLAN.

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.542
BUT OFTEN WE OF THE STANDARDS

00:43:31.608 --> 00:43:32.943
THAT ARE USED BY LOCAL

00:43:33.010 --> 00:43:34.912
GOVERNMENTS ARE THE STANDARDS

00:43:34.979 --> 00:43:36.580
BUT WE WANT THESE TO BE.

00:43:36.647 --> 00:43:38.415
INSTEAD OF A BROAD BASED OF

00:43:38.482 --> 00:43:39.616
REASONABLENESS SO WE CERTAINLY

00:43:39.683 --> 00:43:40.684
CAN KEEP WORKING ON THAT BUT THE

00:43:40.751 --> 00:43:42.920
GOAL IS GET THE EXPERTS IN THERE.

00:43:42.987 --> 00:43:44.421
GET THEM TO TELL US WHAT WE

00:43:44.488 --> 00:43:46.023
SHOULD BE DOING WORKING IN

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:47.624
CONJUNCTION WITH THE LOCAL

00:43:47.691 --> 00:43:49.326
COMMUNITIES AND A LOCAL

00:43:49.393 --> 00:43:52.196
OFFICIALS WHO WILL HOPEFULLY.

00:43:52.262 --> 00:43:54.264
RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF USING THE

00:43:54.331 --> 00:43:55.933
STANDARD SHOULD HAVE BEEN

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.267
DEVELOPED BY THE EXPERTS.

00:43:57.334 --> 00:43:59.236
WELL I JUST I RESPOND THAT BEST

00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:00.938
PRACTICES ARE ALREADY IN

00:44:01.005 --> 00:44:02.306
PRACTICE AND I THINK THAT THOSE

00:44:02.373 --> 00:44:03.607
ARE THE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE

00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:10.848
LOOKED OUT SO WE DON'T PUT SOME

00:44:10.914 --> 00:44:12.182
ARBITRARY.

00:44:12.249 --> 00:44:13.250
TIONS ON THE SIZE OF THE

00:44:13.317 --> 00:44:13.817
DEVELOPMENT WHEN THAT SEES

00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:15.085
SENSUALLY WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO

00:44:15.152 --> 00:44:16.153
HELP PEOPLE FOR COMMUNITIES TO

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:16.587
MEET THE RENOWNED.

00:44:16.653 --> 00:44:17.554
SO I THINK THEY'RE SO I I JUST

00:44:17.621 --> 00:44:18.622
THINK WITHIN AND YOU'VE GOT

00:44:18.689 --> 00:44:19.890
CONFLICTS THAT ALMOST DEFEAT ONE

00:44:19.957 --> 00:44:20.824
ANOTHER AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT

00:44:20.891 --> 00:44:21.725
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THAT IT

00:44:21.792 --> 00:44:22.993
JUST KIND OF REFLECTS THAT AS I

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:23.894
READ IT.

00:44:23.961 --> 00:44:25.596
AND HAVING HAD THE EXPERIENCE

00:44:25.662 --> 00:44:27.865
FRANKLY WE HAVE WHAT ARE CALLED

00:44:27.931 --> 00:44:30.034
FUEL MODIFICATIONS ON DOZEN AND

JOB LEAVE ME I'D LOVE TO PLANT A

00:44:31.802 --> 00:44:33.637
LOT MORE STUFF IN MY FUEL MINES

ON BUT I CAN'T.

00:44:34.972 --> 00:44:36.473
AND NOW I KNOW WHY AND I'M I'M

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.108
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT WE ALSO A

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:40.677

M. DOUBTS BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:44.615
COORDINATED THROUGH THE FIRE

00:44:44.681 --> 00:44:46.183
AUTHORITY ORANGE COUNTY I I

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.885
DON'T THINK WE'RE THAT FAR OFF

00:44:47.951 --> 00:44:50.220
YOUR MAYBE IT'S JUST THE

00:44:50.287 --> 00:44:51.055
EMPHASIS IS ON A DIFFERENT

00:44:51.121 --> 00:44:52.489
SOLANO.

00:44:52.556 --> 00:44:54.158
LANGUAGE WHEN IT GETS RIGHT TO

00:44:54.224 --> 00:44:55.159
RIGIDLY THEN YOU DO RIGHT

00:44:55.225 --> 00:44:57.694
EXACTLY WHAT -- THE V. I. IS

00:44:57.761 --> 00:44:59.296
TALKING ABOUT THAT USE THEIR

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:01.165
FREE THOUGH FORWARD YOU KNOW

00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:02.466
LITIGATION ALL OUT SAID

00:45:02.533 --> 00:45:10.974
CERTAINLY ISN'T THE INTENT AND I

00:45:11.041 --> 00:45:11.175
DON'T.

00:45:11.241 --> 00:45:12.342
BELIEVE THAT.

00:45:12.409 --> 00:45:13.210
THE ARMENIAN TURPIN TATIAN WE'RE

00:45:13.277 --> 00:45:14.244
SEEING IS NOT ONE THAT I SHARE

00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:15.279
BUT CERTAINLY THE INTENT IS NOT

00:45:15.345 --> 00:45:17.681
TO LIMIT -- BUT IT'S TO PROTECT

00:45:17.748 --> 00:45:18.982
AND TO CREATE THE THE THE BEST

00:45:19.049 --> 00:45:22.152
INFRASTRUCTURE -- WE CAN TO

00:45:22.219 --> 00:45:24.254
PROTECT LIFE AND PROPERTY.

00:45:24.321 --> 00:45:27.658
AYE AYE HI I KNOW THAT SECURITY

00:45:27.724 --> 00:45:28.292
AND I'M JUST SAYING TAKE A LOOK

00:45:28.358 --> 00:45:31.462
AT THAT.

00:45:31.528 --> 00:45:34.598
OKAY INTERNATIONAL CENTER COVER

00:45:34.665 --> 00:45:36.867
ERA MY APOLOGIES.

00:45:36.934 --> 00:45:38.202
PICTURE -- YOU KNOW I HAVE SOME

00:45:38.268 --> 00:45:40.104
OF THE SAME CONCERNS AS SENATOR

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:41.738
BATES -- SENATOR JACKSON NIGHT

00:45:41.805 --> 00:45:43.207
THERE WERE THERE WERE TWO THINGS

00:45:43.273 --> 00:45:46.510
THAT JUMPED OUT AT ME WHEN I

00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:48.412
WHEN I READ THIS AND AND BOTH OF

00:45:48.479 --> 00:45:49.680
THEM REALLY GO TOGETHER ONE WAS

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:52.950
THE THE RENO WHAT NUMBER

00:45:53.016 --> 00:45:56.887
DISCUSSION -- AT A I GET THAT

00:45:56.954 --> 00:45:58.522
YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT.

00:45:58.589 --> 00:46:03.827
THE PUBLIC LIFE AND LIMB -- BUT

00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:07.030
TO ABSOLVE THE THE ENTITY.

00:46:07.097 --> 00:46:09.733
THAT HAS AN OBLIGATION TO BUILD

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.535
HOUSING BECAUSE THEY HAVE

00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:13.103
PROPERTY THAT ARE THAT ARE PART

00:46:13.170 --> 00:46:16.306
OF A MOVIE -- I THINK IS IS --

00:46:16.373 --> 00:46:17.374
IS GOING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION

00:46:17.441 --> 00:46:18.408
AND I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT I WAS

00:46:18.475 --> 00:46:19.009
GOING TO ASK YOU WHAT YOUR

00:46:19.076 --> 00:46:20.978
PURPOSE HAS BEEN TRYING TO GET

00:46:21.044 --> 00:46:22.646
RID OF THAT BUT I ONE WAY OR

00:46:22.713 --> 00:46:23.947
ANOTHER IF IT I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:46:24.014 --> 00:46:25.449
THAT THAT YOU'RE GONNA TAKE OUT

00:46:25.516 --> 00:46:26.950
SOME OF THE LANGUAGE I'M.

00:46:27.017 --> 00:46:30.220
STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT --

00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:32.122
MOVING FORWARD WHETHER I FEEL

00:46:32.189 --> 00:46:34.024
CONFIDENT THAT.

00:46:34.091 --> 00:46:36.860
THAT IT IT WON'T SHOW BACK UP

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:40.464
AGAIN BUT I JUST IF AND FRANKLY

00:46:40.531 --> 00:46:43.767
FRANKLY -- I I GET SUSPICIOUS

00:46:43.834 --> 00:46:45.602
WHEN PEOPLE START.

00:46:45.669 --> 00:46:46.837
TINKERING WITH THE READING

00:46:46.904 --> 00:46:50.140
NUMBER EVEN AS AS BAD AS THE

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:52.142
SYSTEM IS IT'S THE ONLY SYSTEM

00:46:52.209 --> 00:46:53.010
WE HAVE.

00:46:53.076 --> 00:46:55.179
AND IF WE'RE NOT BUILDING

00:46:55.245 --> 00:46:55.979
HOUSING THEN WE'RE WE'RE

00:46:56.046 --> 00:47:00.050
EXACERBATING THE GREENHOUSE GAS.

00:47:00.117 --> 00:47:01.318
RIDDICK REDUCTION EFFORTS THAT

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:03.654
WE HAVEN'T AND WE'RE ALSO IT IT

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.055
IT JUST.

00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:07.257
IT FORCES PEOPLE INTO

00:47:07.324 --> 00:47:08.525
HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE THEY JUST

00:47:08.592 --> 00:47:10.260
CAN'T AFFORD THE COST WE DID

00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:11.929
TAKE THE AMENDMENT THAT SAYS

00:47:11.995 --> 00:47:14.531
IT'S A NET ZERO CHOSE TO CLARIFY

00:47:14.598 --> 00:47:17.167
THAT AMENDMENT -- IF WE DID TAKE

00:47:17.234 --> 00:47:19.803
THAT -- BECAUSE THAT ISN'T THE

00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:21.838
INTENT HERE THE INTENT IS SHOWS

00:47:21.905 --> 00:47:23.106
TO BE RESPECTFUL.

00:47:23.173 --> 00:47:25.576
OF THE DANGERS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:47:25.642 --> 00:47:29.146
THE WITH LOUISE AND TO TRY -- TO

00:47:29.213 --> 00:47:31.548
A SURE THAT WE DON'T PEOPLE AT

00:47:31.615 --> 00:47:33.283
IN HARM'S WAY BY BUILDING IN

00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:35.819
AREAS WHERE IT IS DANGEROUS

00:47:35.886 --> 00:47:37.688
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME NOT

00:47:37.754 --> 00:47:40.090
ATTEMPTING AND NOT -- REDUCING

00:47:40.157 --> 00:47:42.659
THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:46.463
HAVE UNDER A WRITTEN. TO THE

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:48.232
RENEWAL REQUIREMENTS SO WE DID

00:47:48.298 --> 00:47:49.433
TAKE THAT IS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

00:47:49.499 --> 00:47:50.667
WERE HERE WHEN WE TOOK THAT

00:47:50.734 --> 00:47:52.769
FIRST AMENDMENT AND AS FAR AS

00:47:52.836 --> 00:47:58.375
THE LANGUAGE TO BALANCE THIS OUT.

00:47:58.442 --> 00:48:00.510
THE KIND OF PERMIT UP IS TO

00:48:00.577 --> 00:48:01.378
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:48:01.445 --> 00:48:02.346
CONTINUE WORKING ON AND THEN THE

00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:03.313
THE OTHER THE OTHER PART REALLY

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.615
HAD TO DO WITH THAT LOCAL

00:48:04.681 --> 00:48:06.216
GOVERNMENT PART OF IT WHICH IS

00:48:06.283 --> 00:48:08.585
THAT -- THERE THEY'RE THEY'RE

00:48:08.652 --> 00:48:10.621
THEY'RE UNSPECIFIED SET ASIDE

00:48:10.687 --> 00:48:12.022
SIDE AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR

00:48:12.089 --> 00:48:13.523
CALIFORNIA FOR GRANTS TO CITIES

00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:15.459
AND COUNTIES -- AND WHILE I I

00:48:15.525 --> 00:48:17.194
THINK IT'S A IT'S A REALLY GOOD

00:48:17.261 --> 00:48:21.732
IDEA THAT WE WE HARDEN -- THE

00:48:21.798 --> 00:48:23.300
SAFETY ISSUES THAT WE HAVE I

00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:24.501
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY LOCAL

00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:25.836
GOVERNMENT IS NOT DOING.

00:48:25.902 --> 00:48:27.571
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO IMPROVE

00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:30.707
ACCESS TO ROADS OUT WATER SUPPLY --

00:48:30.774 --> 00:48:32.409
IF THERE'S A NEED FOR REMOTE

00:48:32.476 --> 00:48:33.944
INFRARED CAMERAS THAT THEY'RE

00:48:34.011 --> 00:48:36.113
NOT DOING IT AND I SAY THAT

00:48:36.179 --> 00:48:38.915
BECAUSE I GOT A LOT OF REQUESTS

00:48:38.982 --> 00:48:40.350
FROM.

00:48:40.417 --> 00:48:41.852
ABOUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN MY

00:48:41.918 --> 00:48:45.155
DISTRICT THIS YEAR FOR FIRE IN

00:48:45.222 --> 00:48:48.792
FIRE -- STATIONS POLICE STATIONS.

00:48:48.859 --> 00:48:52.162
LIBRARIES PARKS AND QUITE

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:54.264
FRANKLY MOST OF MY COMMUNITIES

00:48:54.331 --> 00:48:56.099
ARE BLUE COLLAR POOR COMMUNITIES

00:48:56.166 --> 00:48:58.635
AND THEY PUT THAT ON AS FEES AS

00:48:58.702 --> 00:49:00.504
PART OF THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE

00:49:00.570 --> 00:49:01.938
NEEDS IN THEIR COMMUNITY.

00:49:02.005 --> 00:49:04.341
SO I'M I I LOOK AT THE AT THIS

00:49:04.408 --> 00:49:05.542
AND SAY WHY WOULDN'T LOCAL

00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:06.877
GOVERNMENT PAY FOR THIS OR WHY

00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:07.911
WOULDN'T THAT.

00:49:07.978 --> 00:49:10.247
THE THE FEES IT PEOPLE PAY TO

00:49:10.314 --> 00:49:11.815
LIVE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES VERY

00:49:11.882 --> 00:49:13.650
SIMILAR TO WHAT CENTER BATES

00:49:13.717 --> 00:49:15.619
TALKED ABOUT THEIR THEIR

00:49:15.686 --> 00:49:17.954
HOMEOWNERSASSOCIATION IS IS --

00:49:18.021 --> 00:49:19.656
TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR DOING

00:49:19.723 --> 00:49:21.992
THIS THIS KIND OF THESE KINDS OF

00:49:22.059 --> 00:49:23.960
THINGS SO WHY WOULD WE WANT THE

00:49:24.027 --> 00:49:26.630
STATE TO PAY FOR SOME OF THIS --

00:49:26.697 --> 00:49:27.297
OR YEAH I GET WHAT WAS SOME OF

00:49:27.364 --> 00:49:29.399
THE ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE AREAS IN

00:49:29.466 --> 00:49:30.767
THE MOVIE IN MY OWN DISTRICT

00:49:30.834 --> 00:49:32.002
THAT WOULD THERE'S ONLY ONE

00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:34.805
ACCESS EGRESS AND INGRESS.

00:49:34.871 --> 00:49:35.906
AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BUILD

00:49:35.972 --> 00:49:38.675
THAT THAT ADDITIONAL ACCESS SO

00:49:38.742 --> 00:49:39.843
IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:41.078
HAPPENED IN PARADISE THAT WAS

00:49:41.144 --> 00:49:42.612
VERY SIMILAR PROBLEM AND THEY

00:49:42.679 --> 00:49:44.781
EITHER DIDN'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL

00:49:44.848 --> 00:49:46.483
RESOURCES TO BUILD.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:49.820
ANOTHER WAY OUT OR FOR REASONS

00:49:49.886 --> 00:49:51.054
THAT WE NOW LOOK BACK AND

00:49:51.121 --> 00:49:52.889
HINDSIGHT WERE MORE FOOLISH ONCE

00:49:52.956 --> 00:49:54.725
THEY DID NOT DO SO.

00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:56.360
SO THAT'S PART OF THE THAT'S

00:49:56.426 --> 00:49:58.161
PART OF WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT

00:49:58.228 --> 00:49:58.829
IS THERE.

00:49:58.895 --> 00:50:00.297
IS THERE SUFFICIENT INGRESS OR

00:50:00.364 --> 00:50:01.832
EGRESS OF THE PEOPLE GET OUT IF

00:50:01.898 --> 00:50:03.100
THEY HAVE.

00:50:03.166 --> 00:50:04.634
TO DO WE HAVE ENOUGH -- WATER

00:50:04.701 --> 00:50:06.837
SUPPLY DO WE HAVE ENOUGH

00:50:06.903 --> 00:50:09.373
ELECTRICITY TO PUMP THE WATER.

00:50:09.439 --> 00:50:11.241
IF IF IT'S NECESSARY IN THOSE

00:50:11.308 --> 00:50:13.477
AREAS THESE ARE ALL QUESTIONS

00:50:13.543 --> 00:50:16.546
THAT THAT WE NEED TO ASK IN THAT.

00:50:16.613 --> 00:50:18.482
WE FRANKLY HAVE NOT DONE A REAL

00:50:18.548 --> 00:50:20.117
GOOD JOB.

00:50:20.183 --> 00:50:22.018
ADDRESSING THOSE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:50:22.085 --> 00:50:23.587
NEEDS WHEN WE SEE.

00:50:23.653 --> 00:50:24.988
YOU KNOW ALL THE FIRES THAT

00:50:25.055 --> 00:50:26.289
WE'VE HAD IN THE IN THE

00:50:26.356 --> 00:50:27.924
INABILITY WE'VE HAD TO FIGHT

00:50:27.991 --> 00:50:30.627
THEM BECAUSE THE LOOK OF THE

00:50:30.694 --> 00:50:33.063
LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE -- SO

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:36.166
AGAIN -- BUILDING A FIRE STATION

00:50:36.233 --> 00:50:37.634
IS ONE THING AND YOU KNOW YOU

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:45.175
CAN DO YOU CAN DO CERTAIN THINGS.

00:50:45.242 --> 00:50:45.876
BUT WHEN YOU'RE.

00:50:45.942 --> 00:50:47.244
BUILDING OR WHEN YOU'RE

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:48.912
ADDRESSING -- POPULATIONS IN

00:50:48.979 --> 00:50:50.580
THAT WILDLIFE URBAN INTERFACE

00:50:50.647 --> 00:50:51.748
THE ANSWERS AREN'T ALWAYS SO

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:51.982
SIMPLE.

00:50:52.048 --> 00:50:52.582
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS

00:50:52.649 --> 00:50:53.283
THAT WE HAVE TO START LOOKING AT

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:55.051
WHERE WE ARE BUILDING BECAUSE

00:50:55.118 --> 00:50:56.319
THE COST.

00:50:56.386 --> 00:50:57.354
OF PUTTING IN THAT

00:50:57.421 --> 00:50:59.389
INFRASTRUCTURE MAY BE

00:50:59.456 --> 00:51:00.323
PROHIBITIVE.

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:01.825
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER PEOPLE ARE

00:51:01.892 --> 00:51:06.830
PAYING FEES ARE NOT.

00:51:06.897 --> 00:51:08.732
I THINK -- THERE ALSO.

00:51:08.799 --> 00:51:12.402
THANK YOU CHAIR -- I NOT SURE

00:51:12.469 --> 00:51:13.937
I'M I'M MAY BE MISSING SOMETHING

00:51:14.004 --> 00:51:15.439
HERE IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE

00:51:15.505 --> 00:51:17.474
ISSUES A BEEN BROUGHT UP.

00:51:17.541 --> 00:51:19.376
WE'RE TASKED WITH FIGURING OUT

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:20.877
HOW TO ADJUST THE WAY WE DO

00:51:20.944 --> 00:51:21.878
THINGS.

00:51:21.945 --> 00:51:23.280
IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THERE

00:51:23.346 --> 00:51:27.284
IS THIS ENVIRONMENTAL GLOBAL.

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:28.452
ISSUE MORE MEAN ISSUE.

00:51:28.518 --> 00:51:31.655
AND WE CAN DO THINGS THE SAME

00:51:31.721 --> 00:51:33.156
WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THEM

00:51:33.223 --> 00:51:35.725
FOR AND THEY THEY MIGHT HAVE.

00:51:35.792 --> 00:51:37.894
MET A CERTAIN NEED BEFORE.

00:51:37.961 --> 00:51:39.596
BUT THEY'RE NOT MEETING THE

00:51:39.663 --> 00:51:41.031
NEEDS THAT WE HAVE ANYMORE.

00:51:41.097 --> 00:51:43.600
SO I UNDERSTAND WHY THIS MIGHT

00:51:43.667 --> 00:51:45.368
BE A LITTLE FRUSTRATING FOR THE

00:51:45.435 --> 00:51:49.039
BUILDING -- INDUSTRY.

00:51:49.105 --> 00:51:51.508
BUT IF WE DON'T MAKE ADJUSTMENTS

00:51:51.575 --> 00:51:54.010
TO THE WAY WE DO THINGS IN THE

00:51:54.077 --> 00:51:56.780
FUTURE AS FAR AS BUILDING WHERE

00:51:56.847 --> 00:51:58.181
WE SHOULD OR BUILDING WHERE WE

00:51:58.248 --> 00:52:00.016
SHOULD AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE

00:52:00.083 --> 00:52:01.251
TO FACE THE SAME.

00:52:01.318 --> 00:52:04.087
CRISIS IS GOING TO GET WORSE AND

00:52:04.154 --> 00:52:04.488
WORSE SO.

00:52:04.554 --> 00:52:06.056
I'M NOT SURE IF I'M MISSING

00:52:06.122 --> 00:52:07.524
SOMETHING BUT I THINK THAT YOU

00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:09.793
HAVE ADDRESSED THE ISSUES AS FAR

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:13.330
AS WHERE WE NEED TO PLAN THIS IS

00:52:13.396 --> 00:52:15.332
ABOUT PLANNING AHEAD.

00:52:15.398 --> 00:52:17.367
AND NOT JUST REACTING WE HAVE

00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:19.836
SPENT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

00:52:19.903 --> 00:52:22.138
AND THOSE MEN AND WOMEN AND

00:52:22.205 --> 00:52:23.874
FAMILIES WHO SUFFERED EITHER

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:25.375
BECAUSE THEY LOST SOMEONE THEY

00:52:25.442 --> 00:52:26.776
LOST THEIR HOMES.

00:52:26.843 --> 00:52:28.278
I MEAN THE THERE IS JUST

00:52:28.345 --> 00:52:31.581
NUMEROUS PROBLEMS AND ISSUES AND

00:52:31.648 --> 00:52:32.983
SUFFERING THAT HAVE HAPPENED.

00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:36.186
NOW WE WANT TO SORT OF A JUST TO

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:37.454
SAY THOSE TWO THINGS A LITTLE

00:52:37.521 --> 00:52:39.055
BIT DIFFERENT HERE WHILE NOT

00:52:39.122 --> 00:52:40.357
FORGETTING THAT WE HAVE TO

00:52:40.423 --> 00:52:45.295
CONTINUE TO BILLS SO -- YOU

00:52:45.362 --> 00:52:45.929
CERTAINLY HAVE ANSWERED ALL OF

00:52:45.996 --> 00:52:48.865
MY QUESTIONS AND I THINK YOU'VE

00:52:48.932 --> 00:52:50.901
DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF MONTH.

00:52:50.967 --> 00:52:52.135
COLLEAGUES ANY ADDITIONAL.

00:52:52.202 --> 00:52:54.437
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

00:52:54.504 --> 00:52:55.639
SO I WANT.

00:52:55.705 --> 00:52:57.274
TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:59.442
WITH US AND JUST TO GIVE -- SIR

00:52:59.509 --> 00:53:01.177
PUBLICLY SAY WHAT WORK WITH MY

00:53:01.244 --> 00:53:03.280
PERSPECTIVE IS ON ON THIS AND

00:53:03.346 --> 00:53:04.681
THIS IS NOTHING THAT -- THE

00:53:04.748 --> 00:53:05.515
AUTHOR HASN'T.

00:53:05.582 --> 00:53:07.517
HEARD AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK

00:53:07.584 --> 00:53:10.387
ON THIS ON HI -- I AGREED THAT

00:53:10.453 --> 00:53:13.523
WE NEED TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:14.424
IN TERMS OF WHERE WE BUILD AND

00:53:14.491 --> 00:53:16.026
THERE ARE AREAS.

00:53:16.092 --> 00:53:19.729
WHERE WE SHOULD -- BE PULLING

00:53:19.796 --> 00:53:22.065
BACK ON IT WAS A TOUCHY AREA

00:53:22.132 --> 00:53:22.632
BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:53:22.699 --> 00:53:23.833
PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING.

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:27.604
IN IN THESE AREAS ON BUT IT'S

00:53:27.671 --> 00:53:28.872
NOT SUSTAINABLE TO JUST CONTINUE

00:53:28.939 --> 00:53:30.774
PUT MORE MORE HOUSING IN THESE

00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:31.942
HIGH RISK.

00:53:32.008 --> 00:53:37.380
AREAS.

00:53:37.447 --> 00:53:38.715
BUT AT THE SAME TIME.

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:40.417
WE CALIFORNIA HAS A THREE AND A

00:53:40.483 --> 00:53:42.252
HALF MILLION HOME DOT HOUSING

00:53:42.319 --> 00:53:42.686
DEFICIT.

00:53:42.752 --> 00:53:43.620
I'VE SAID THIS BEFORE AND I

00:53:43.687 --> 00:53:44.354
SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD BUT

00:53:44.421 --> 00:53:45.689
IT'S SORT OF EXTRAORDINARY OUR

00:53:45.755 --> 00:53:46.823
HOUSING DEFICIT OF THREE MILLION

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:47.557
HOMES.

00:53:47.624 --> 00:53:48.358
IS EQUAL TO THE HOUSING DEFICIT

00:53:48.425 --> 00:53:50.293
AND THE OTHER FORTY NINE STATES

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:50.961
COMBINED.

00:53:51.027 --> 00:53:52.395
WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOMES PER

00:53:52.462 --> 00:53:53.496
CAPITA?

00:53:53.563 --> 00:53:56.299
CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY NINE OUT

00:53:56.366 --> 00:53:57.400
OF FIFTY SAY THAT AGAIN

00:53:57.467 --> 00:53:59.302
CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY NINE OUT

00:53:59.369 --> 00:54:01.404
OF FIFTY IN HOMES PER CAPITA THE

00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:02.872
ONLY STATE THAT IS LOWER.

00:54:02.939 --> 00:54:05.208
IS THE STATE OF UTAH -- WHEN I'M

00:54:05.275 --> 00:54:07.310
SPECULATING THAT THEY HAVE

00:54:07.377 --> 00:54:09.012
LARGER HOUSEHOLD SIZES AND

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:10.180
THAT'S WHY OTHERWISE WE WOULD

00:54:10.246 --> 00:54:13.083
PROBABLY BE FIFTY OUT OF?

00:54:13.149 --> 00:54:15.285
FIFTY AND SO AS WE START

00:54:15.352 --> 00:54:16.419
THINKING ABOUT OKAY ARE THERE

00:54:16.486 --> 00:54:20.790
AREAS WHERE WE DON'T WANT TO

00:54:20.857 --> 00:54:22.592
BUILD HOUSING ANYMORE.

00:54:22.659 --> 00:54:24.060
WE HAVE WE CAN'T JUST LOOK AT

00:54:24.127 --> 00:54:25.128
THAT SIDE OF THE EQUATION WE

00:54:25.195 --> 00:54:26.496
HAVE TO SAY OKAY WHERE ARE WE

00:54:26.563 --> 00:54:27.764
GOING. TO BUILD THE HOUSE AND

00:54:27.831 --> 00:54:29.466
THAT'S WHY I DID HAVE CONCERNS

00:54:29.532 --> 00:54:31.134
ABOUT THE WAY THIS IS PHRASED IN

00:54:31.201 --> 00:54:33.236
TERMS OF POTENTIALLY LOWERING

00:54:33.303 --> 00:54:35.005
RINA ALLOCATIONS.

00:54:35.071 --> 00:54:36.573
IN CITIES.

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.942
AND WITHOUT SAYING OKAY WHERE

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:40.810
ELSE IN YOUR CITY ARE YOU GOING

00:54:40.877 --> 00:54:42.145
TO BUILD OKAY YOU HAVE A PROBLEM

00:54:42.212 --> 00:54:44.314
AREA HERE BUT YOU CAN DO MORE

00:54:44.381 --> 00:54:45.448
HERE AND MAYBE.

00:54:45.515 --> 00:54:51.221
THAT AND THE OTHER PIECE OF IT --

00:54:51.287 --> 00:54:53.123
IS THAT WE KNOW HAVING GONE

00:54:53.189 --> 00:54:54.357
THROUGH THE RENO PROCESS AND I

00:54:54.424 --> 00:54:55.925
KNOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE GONE TO

00:54:55.992 --> 00:54:57.627
THE RE IN A PROCESS. ONE OF THE

00:54:57.694 --> 00:55:00.463
WORST. ONE OF THE WORST PARTS OF

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:02.132
THE RENO PROCESS.

00:55:02.198 --> 00:55:04.634
IS THAT CITIES THAT ARE

00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:05.935
WEALTHIER AND MORE POWERFUL.

00:55:06.002 --> 00:55:08.171
SHOW OF MAUREEN OBLIGATION AND

00:55:08.238 --> 00:55:10.407
THE CITIES THAT ARE LOWER INCOME

00:55:10.473 --> 00:55:12.542
AND LESS POWERFUL IT'S ALWAYS

00:55:12.609 --> 00:55:14.244
BEEN THE WAY IT'S BEEN WITH RINA --

00:55:14.310 --> 00:55:16.713
AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIX THAT BUT

00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:19.983
WHAT WE DON'T WANT -- IS -- FOR

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:21.818
WHEN WE SAY THE COGS YOU CAN

00:55:21.885 --> 00:55:23.520
DECIDE HOW TO ALLOCATE A IT HAS

00:55:23.586 --> 00:55:24.754
TO BE CABINS.

00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:26.823
SO WE DON'T HAVE AREAS THAT ARE

00:55:26.890 --> 00:55:28.358
MORE POWERFUL PUSHING HOUSING

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:52.081
SO IF WE'RE LOOKING AT A SMALL --

01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:54.217

AS THEY NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT.

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:39.715
POLICY FEATURES CAN BE MUCH LESS

01:03:39.782 --> 01:03:41.384
COSTLY WHEN BUILT INTO THE

ORIGINAL DESIGN OF THE HOUSING.

A DEVELOPMENT AN INDIVIDUAL

01:04:04.407 --> 01:04:06.075
EXORBITANT.

01:04:06.142 --> 01:04:08.144
NEXT TO THE COST OF WHAT IT

CALIFORNIA CAN ALSO PRESERVE

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:30.700
WEALTH SO THAT CALIFORNIANS WILL

01:04:30.766 --> 01:04:33.102
BE ABLE TO SAVE MONEY AS A AGE.

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:34.537
BY NOT HAVING TO MOVE WHEN THEIR

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:36.105
PHYSICAL ABILITIES ECOME

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:39.342

01:04:42.178 --> 01:04:43.779
CALIFORNIA HAS TO IMPENDING

01:04:43.846 --> 01:04:46.082
CRISES. ONE IS THE LACK OF

YOUNG AND OLD CALIFORNIANS A

01:04:50.019 --> 01:04:50.586
LIGHT.

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:52.955
THE SECOND IS HOW WILL WE PAY

01:04:53.022 --> 01:04:54.090

AND IF THEY HAVE A FALL AND IT

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:11.173
MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.575
LIVE IN THEIR HOMES OTHERWISE.

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:14.043

BECAUSE A MANAGER CAN SAY -- IT

01:19:20.088 --> 01:19:22.624

ACTIONS THAT WOULD DECREASE OR

01:38:31.472 --> 01:38:32.573
DELAY.

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:35.576
THE NEW HOUSING SUCH AS DOWN

01:38:35.643 --> 01:38:37.511
ZONING.

01:38:52.359 --> 01:38:54.762
OF TRANSIT BANDED EXAM SMALL

01:38:54.828 --> 01:38:57.898
ROLE CITIES NOW WHY IS THAT IN

01:38:57.965 --> 01:39:00.367
THE BILL BECAUSE WHAT MAKES

01:39:00.434 --> 01:39:02.236
HOUSING COSTS LEAVE BESIDES JUST

01:39:05.005 --> 01:39:06.340
IS TIME.

01:39:06.407 --> 01:39:08.509
SO DELAY NOW THAT'S WHY WE'RE

01:39:08.575 --> 01:39:09.910
TRYING TO SPEED UP THE PROCESS.

01:39:09.977 --> 01:39:12.780

AND HOW IT IS BUILT.

01:39:28.929 --> 01:39:30.631
SO THE LIFTING THE PARKING

01:39:32.266 --> 01:39:34.134

COMMITTEE THAT CALIFORNIA IS IN

01:40:23.484 --> 01:40:24.952
THE THROES OF A DEEP AND

01:40:25.018 --> 01:40:26.553
WORSENING HOUSING CRISIS THAT

01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:27.054
THREATENS.

01:40:27.121 --> 01:40:28.756
OF I TELL THE ENTIRE STATE WE

01:40:28.822 --> 01:40:31.392
HAVE HALF OF ALL THE RENTERS

01:40:31.458 --> 01:40:32.259
THAT ARE CONSIDERED RENT PER

MINUTE OF OF THOSE 30% ARE

01:40:34.528 --> 01:40:35.295
CONSIDERED.

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:36.597
A SEVERELY RENT BURDENS ON TOP

01:40:36.663 --> 01:40:38.866
OF THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING OUR

01:40:38.932 --> 01:40:40.167
LOWEST RATES OF HOMEOWNERSHIP

01:40:40.234 --> 01:40:41.468
SINCE THE NINETEEN FORTIES SO

01:40:41.535 --> 01:40:43.203
LEAGUE NEEDLESS TO SAY THE THE

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:44.538
SCALE THIS CHALLENGE.

01:40:44.605 --> 01:40:46.206
DEMANDS POLICIES THAT MATCH THE

01:40:46.273 --> 01:40:47.674
MAGNITUDE OF THIS PROBLEM AND

01:40:47.741 --> 01:40:49.209
THERE ARE A FEW POLICIES ON THE

01:40:49.276 --> 01:40:50.778
TABLE THAT ARE AS BOLD.

01:40:50.844 --> 01:40:52.613
AS WAS PROPOSED IN SB THREE

01:40:52.679 --> 01:40:53.347
THIRTY SO SO WE ARE SUPPORTING

01:40:53.414 --> 01:40:54.915
THIS BILL FOR TWO SPECIFIC

01:40:54.982 --> 01:40:55.949
REASONS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY

01:40:56.016 --> 01:40:57.384
OUR RESEARCH.

01:40:57.451 --> 01:40:58.452
AND THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THAT

01:40:58.519 --> 01:40:59.987
IT WOULD LARGELY PROHIBIT DOWN

01:41:00.053 --> 01:41:01.488
ZONING SOME MORATORIUM'S THAT

01:41:01.555 --> 01:41:02.623
WOULD LIMIT THE CAPACITY FOR NEW

01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:04.091
HOUSING AS PART OF OUR

01:41:04.158 --> 01:41:07.027
CALIFORNIA LAND USE SURVEY -- WE

01:41:07.094 --> 01:41:08.762
HAD WE SAW THAT MANY CITIES ARE

01:41:08.829 --> 01:41:10.931
DOING -- THEIR THEIR FAIR SHARE

01:41:10.998 --> 01:41:12.766
TO REDUCE BARRIERS TO NEW

01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:13.600
HOUSING.

01:41:13.667 --> 01:41:15.002
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SEVERAL

01:41:15.068 --> 01:41:22.409
CITIES THAT ACTUALLY REPORTED TO

01:41:22.476 --> 01:41:23.644
US THAT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS

01:41:23.710 --> 01:41:25.212
THEY HAVE MADE THEIR LAND USE

01:41:25.279 --> 01:41:25.813
EVEN MORE RESTRICTIVE.

01:41:25.879 --> 01:41:26.447
MANY TIMES THESE ARE COMMUNITIES

01:41:26.513 --> 01:41:27.815
OF AYE OPPORTUNITY WHERE IT IS

01:41:27.881 --> 01:41:29.616
APPROPRIATE TO TO BE LOOKING TO

01:41:29.683 --> 01:41:31.618
BUILD FOR HOUSING AND SO THIS

01:41:31.685 --> 01:41:32.953
BILL WOULD HELP ADDRESS THAT.

01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:35.289
ALSO THE COST TO BUILD HOUSING --

01:41:35.355 --> 01:41:37.024
IT IS -- WAS PARTICULARLY --

01:41:37.090 --> 01:41:38.058
GONE VERY HIGH THE LAST TEN

01:41:38.125 --> 01:41:39.326
YEARS AND THIS BILL WOULD HELP

01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:40.928
ADDRESS THAT BY LIMITING OUR

01:41:40.994 --> 01:41:42.196
PARKING REQUIREMENTS MODIFYING

01:41:42.262 --> 01:41:44.064
HOW FEES WILL BE IMPOSED IN

01:41:44.131 --> 01:41:45.165
LIMITING OTHER.

01:41:45.232 --> 01:41:47.100
OWNERS POLICIES SO IS OUR WORK

01:41:47.167 --> 01:41:48.602
IS ALSO SHOWN THE COST TO BUILD

01:41:48.669 --> 01:41:50.737

OVERALL COST TO BUILD NEW HOMES.

01:42:05.452 --> 01:42:07.154

IT FOR A DECADE IT'S REALLY

01:46:26.113 --> 01:46:27.881
CROSS PURPOSES WITH WHAT THE

01:46:27.948 --> 01:46:29.616
LEGISLATURE TOLD US TO DO.

01:46:29.683 --> 01:46:30.784
LAST TIME I SPOKE ABOUT RENT

01:46:30.851 --> 01:46:32.285
CONTROL AND AND ACTUALLY

01:46:32.352 --> 01:46:32.919
MENTIONED THAT THE SUPERFLUOUS

01:46:32.986 --> 01:46:34.688
FROM GENERATE CONTROL IT DOESN'T

01:46:34.755 --> 01:46:35.922
DO THAT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A

01:46:35.989 --> 01:46:37.390
PRECLUDES US FROM IMPOSING

01:46:37.457 --> 01:46:38.992
INCLUSION HOUSING REQUIREMENTS

01:46:39.059 --> 01:46:40.093
FOR DECADES OF THE CITY DOESN'T

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.628
HAVE INCLUSIONARY HOUSING NOW.

01:46:41.695 --> 01:46:43.196
WE COULDN'T DO THAT -- BUT THE

01:46:43.263 --> 01:46:45.665
LEGISLATURE'S PASSED AB FIFTEEN

01:46:45.732 --> 01:46:46.767
OH FIVE THAT CLARIFIED SOME THIS

01:46:46.833 --> 01:46:48.135
IS A REALLY TO RENTAL HOUSING.

01:46:48.201 --> 01:46:49.169
AND IT'S A POLICY THE STATE THE

01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:50.403
YEAH WE WANT TO SEE INCLUSIONARY

01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:51.338
THAT'S A WAY FOR US TO GET

01:46:51.404 --> 01:46:51.872
AFFORDABLE UNITS BUILT OUR

01:46:51.938 --> 01:46:52.739
CMMUNITY.

01:46:52.806 --> 01:46:54.474
THIS WOULD CERTAINLY PAS THAT

01:46:54.541 --> 01:46:55.108
FOR A DECADE AND WE WOULDN'T BE

01:46:55.175 --> 01:46:56.109
ABLE TO DO THAT.

01:46:56.176 --> 01:46:57.310
SOME OF OUR JURISDICTIONS EVEN

01:46:57.377 --> 01:46:58.812
GONE AS FAR AS WEAVING SOME OF

01:46:58.879 --> 01:47:01.081
THESE FEES ON THEIR OWN AND

01:47:01.148 --> 01:47:01.648
PAYING FOR IT OUT OF THERE

01:47:01.715 --> 01:47:02.516
GENERAL FUND.

01:47:02.582 --> 01:47:03.850
THE CITY IS CURRENTLY DOING THAT

01:47:03.917 --> 01:47:05.185
SAY FOR EXCESS RECALLING UNITS

01:47:05.252 --> 01:47:15.162
THAT THEY'RE PAYING FOR IT AS

01:47:15.228 --> 01:47:16.096
OUR GENERAL FUND.

01:47:16.163 --> 01:47:16.596
THAT DECADE IF THERE'S A

01:47:16.663 --> 01:47:17.197
DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY THEY

01:47:17.264 --> 01:47:18.365
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO REIMPOSE

01:47:18.431 --> 01:47:19.699
THOSE FEES -- SINCE EVEN COVER

01:47:19.766 --> 01:47:20.667
AMOUNT OF THEIR AND OTHER

01:47:20.734 --> 01:47:21.735
GENERAL FUND SO YOU KNOW WE WE

01:47:21.802 --> 01:47:22.302
THINK FREEZE INDUSTRIES FOR

01:47:22.369 --> 01:47:23.036
DECADE IS IS IS A LITTLE TOO

01:47:23.103 --> 01:47:24.905
BROAD FOR EVERY JURISDICTION WE

01:47:24.971 --> 01:47:25.539
DON'T THINK THAT SHE HAS A GOOD

01:47:25.605 --> 01:47:26.239
CASE.

01:47:26.306 --> 01:47:27.541
IT REALLY IS A JURISDICTIONS AT

01:47:27.607 --> 01:47:28.141
THE RIVER THAT FALL UNDER THIS

01:47:28.208 --> 01:47:28.341
BILL.

01:47:28.408 --> 01:47:29.409
NOW WITH REGARD TO PARKING WE

01:47:29.476 --> 01:47:30.177
CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE AMENDED

01:47:30.243 --> 01:47:31.378
ON PARKING THAT ARE REALLY ONLY

01:47:31.444 --> 01:47:32.412
PERTAINS TO THE QUARTER MILE --

01:47:32.479 --> 01:47:33.947
FROM TRANSIT OR YOU COULD HAVE A

01:47:34.014 --> 01:47:35.382
SPOT IF YOU'RE BEYOND THAT --

01:47:35.448 --> 01:47:36.183
DIDN'T PORTENT THING TO NOTE

01:47:36.249 --> 01:47:36.983
ABOUT PARKING AS PRIDE ONE THING

01:47:37.050 --> 01:47:37.617
THAT WE FIGHT OVER THE MOST I

01:47:37.684 --> 01:47:38.518
THINK AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS

01:47:38.585 --> 01:47:38.885
PARKING PEOPLE.

01:47:38.952 --> 01:47:39.820
YOU KNOW WE WANT TO GET FOLKS

01:47:39.886 --> 01:47:40.453
OUT OF THE CAR SIR POLICIES IN

01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:41.922
PLACE AT THE STATE LEVEL TO GET

01:47:41.988 --> 01:47:42.989
PEOPLE OTHER CARS BUT IT WAS

01:47:43.056 --> 01:47:43.557
GIVEN OF THE CAR.

01:47:43.623 --> 01:47:44.825
SO WE ALWAYS HAVE TO BALANCE

01:47:44.891 --> 01:47:46.560
THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THE

01:47:46.626 --> 01:47:48.094
SENATOR YOU MENTIONED THE THE

01:47:48.161 --> 01:47:49.629
LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT SAVES

01:47:49.696 --> 01:47:50.864
WHEN WE DON'T IMPOSE PARKING

01:47:50.931 --> 01:47:51.798
FARMS ARE DEVELOPER.

01:47:51.865 --> 01:47:52.999
UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL DOESN'T

01:47:53.066 --> 01:47:54.868
CAPTURE THAT SO AT A MINIMUM I

01:47:54.935 --> 01:47:55.836
WOULD THINK THAT IF THE STATE

01:47:55.902 --> 01:47:57.037
WANTS TO NOT ALLOW LOCAL

01:47:57.103 --> 01:47:58.738
JURISDICTIONS IMPOSE PARKING OR

01:47:58.805 --> 01:47:59.973
RESTRICT THAT PARKING.

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:01.074
THAT THERE'S AT LEAST SOME

01:48:01.141 --> 01:48:02.375
DEMONSTRATION ON THE DEVELOPERS

01:48:02.442 --> 01:48:03.610
AND THAT THE COST OF THE

01:48:03.677 --> 01:48:04.611
DEVELOPMENT IS EITHER GONE DOWN

01:48:04.678 --> 01:48:06.313
ORDER SOME SORT OF AFFORDABILITY

01:48:06.379 --> 01:48:07.881
REQUIREMENT IT JUST SEEMS THAT

01:48:07.948 --> 01:48:08.481
IT MAKES SENSE SO WE WANT TO

01:48:08.548 --> 01:48:09.282
CAPTURE THAT.

01:48:09.349 --> 01:48:10.784
BECAUSE OF NOT DEVELOPERS OR

01:48:10.851 --> 01:48:11.885
LIKELY THESE THOSE ARE FOR

01:48:11.952 --> 01:48:12.919
PROFIT WE'RE GONNA MAKE MORE

01:48:12.986 --> 01:48:14.054
MONEY BECAUSE ARE UNDER NO

01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:16.489
OBLIGATION TO TO LOWER THE COST

01:48:16.556 --> 01:48:18.525
WE ALSO HAVE AN AMOUNT OF TIME

01:48:18.592 --> 01:48:19.092
THERE'S A ONE QUICK LITTLE

01:48:19.159 --> 01:48:19.426
LASTING SAY.

01:48:19.492 --> 01:48:21.261
THE INITIAL COMPLETE APPLICATION

01:48:21.328 --> 01:48:22.562
I THINK -- MY COLLEAGUES PRETTY

01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:23.263
PIECE FOR YOU TALK ABOUT THAT --

01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:24.865
BUT THAT'S A NEW ISSUE IN THE

01:48:24.931 --> 01:48:26.700
BILL A NEW CONCEPT AND WE

01:48:26.766 --> 01:48:27.701
CERTAINLY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

01:48:27.767 --> 01:48:28.902
THAT SINCE EACH CD WILL

01:48:28.969 --> 01:48:30.470
DETERMINE WHAT IS OR WHAT

01:48:30.537 --> 01:48:32.439
INFORMATION IS INCLUDED IT TO

01:48:32.505 --> 01:48:33.607
MAKE IT COMPLETE THE APPLICATION.

01:48:33.673 --> 01:48:34.641
THEY'RE GONNA DO THAT OUTSIDE OF

01:48:34.708 --> 01:48:35.742
THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES

01:48:35.809 --> 01:48:37.110
ACT WHICH MEANS YOU CAN JUST DO

01:48:37.177 --> 01:48:38.678
IT HOWEVER THEY WANT WITHOUT ANY

01:48:38.745 --> 01:48:47.020
INPUT WITH THAT WE RESPECTFULLY

01:48:47.087 --> 01:48:48.989
OPPOSE THIS MEASURE.

01:48:49.055 --> 01:48:50.290
CITY GEORGIA PRESENTING THE

01:48:50.357 --> 01:48:51.591

SHE THE OTHER STAFF WORKING WITH

01:48:52.325 --> 01:48:52.993
US -- IN FACT SHE'S PROBABLY

01:48:53.059 --> 01:48:53.660
GONNA GET OUR ATTORNEYS TOGETHER

01:48:53.727 --> 01:48:54.294
WITH THEIR ATTORNEYS AND WE LOOK

01:48:54.361 --> 01:48:54.961

01:48:55.028 --> 01:48:55.595
A NUMBER A SUBSTANTIVE REMAINING

01:48:55.662 --> 01:48:55.829
ISSUES.

01:48:55.896 --> 01:48:56.496
I THINK A LOT OF THE PIECES OF

01:48:56.563 --> 01:48:58.698
THE BILL ARE SUPPORTED BY A PA --

01:48:58.765 --> 01:49:00.667
INCLUDING THE FREEZE ON

01:49:00.734 --> 01:49:02.769
INITIATIVE IMPOSE LIMITATIONS

LOCAL VOTER APPROVAL FROM SOME

01:49:06.706 --> 01:49:08.141
HOUSING DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE.

01:49:08.208 --> 01:49:10.110
LIMITING RESPONSES ON EVERY VICE

01:49:10.176 --> 01:49:11.578

MORE TECHNICAL ISSUES.

01:49:31.398 --> 01:49:32.599

INITIAL APPLICATION.

01:49:40.707 --> 01:49:42.409
THE E. DEFINITION OF THAT.

01:49:42.475 --> 01:49:43.510
DOES NOT INCLUDE ENOUGH

01:49:43.576 --> 01:49:45.312
INFORMATION FOR THE JURISDICTION

01:49:45.378 --> 01:49:47.180
DEAVER EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT

01:49:47.247 --> 01:49:49.249
THINGS COULD BE APPLIED OR

01:49:49.316 --> 01:49:50.750
SHOULD BE APPLIED.

01:49:50.817 --> 01:49:52.719
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:49:52.786 --> 01:49:54.888
THAT IS VERY VERY CLEAR BEFORE

01:49:54.955 --> 01:49:56.589
WE GET -- ONE OF THOSE

01:49:56.656 --> 01:49:58.658
APPLICATIONS BUT WE DON'T THINK

01:49:58.725 --> 01:49:59.993
IT'S NECESSARY TO ADDITIONAL.

01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:02.595
AT LAYER OF PROCESS WHEN

01:50:02.662 --> 01:50:03.930
EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO STREAMLINE

01:50:03.997 --> 01:50:05.465
THE PROCESS SO WE DO THINK THAT

01:50:05.532 --> 01:50:07.200
THAT SHOULD BE -- ELIMINATED

01:50:07.267 --> 01:50:09.402
FROM THE BILL -- THE RETROACTIVE

01:50:09.469 --> 01:50:11.137
FREEZE DATES FOR A LOT OF

01:50:11.204 --> 01:50:12.072
REQUIREMENTS ON THE OFF THE

01:50:12.138 --> 01:50:13.573
TABLE INCLUDING ALL THE HOUSING

01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:14.708
BILLS THAT WERE SIGNED A LAW

01:50:14.774 --> 01:50:16.810
LAST YEAR INCLUSIONARY ZONING IF

01:50:16.876 --> 01:50:18.278
THEY HAVE AN ADOPTED.

01:50:18.345 --> 01:50:19.713
ONE EVEN SOME OF THE ATTEMPTS

01:50:19.779 --> 01:50:22.215
FROM THE LOCAL LEVEL TO MAKE

01:50:22.282 --> 01:50:22.983
OBJECTIVE DESIGN REVIEW

01:50:23.049 --> 01:50:24.684
STANDARDS ALL THOSE THINGS COULD

01:50:24.751 --> 01:50:26.786
BE DETERMINED TO INCREASE THE

01:50:26.853 --> 01:50:27.887
COST OF HOUSING EVEN THOUGH

01:50:27.954 --> 01:50:29.489
THEY'RE MEANT TO STREAMLINE THE

01:50:29.556 --> 01:50:30.156
PROCESS.

01:50:30.223 --> 01:50:31.992
OF THE LIMITING THE DESIGN

01:50:32.058 --> 01:50:33.793
STANDARDS IF THEY'RE MORE COSTLY

01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:35.528
AND EFFECTIVE JANUARY FIRST.

01:50:35.595 --> 01:50:36.830
THAT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT I

01:50:36.896 --> 01:50:38.531
THINK INCLUDES THINGS THAT WOULD

01:50:38.598 --> 01:50:42.235
PROBABLY BE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE

01:50:42.302 --> 01:50:42.869
OF WHERE THE AUTHOR WANTS TO BE

01:50:42.936 --> 01:50:43.570
IN THE END.

01:50:43.636 --> 01:50:44.004
THE AFFORDABLE ROGUE

01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:47.040
REQUIREMENTS SHOULD BE EXPANDED

01:50:47.107 --> 01:50:48.908
STREAMLINING THE BILL -- AND

01:50:48.975 --> 01:50:50.143
WERE ALSO VERY CONCERNED WITH

01:50:50.210 --> 01:50:51.311
THE ARBITRARY NUMBER OF HEARINGS

01:50:51.378 --> 01:50:52.846
VERTICALLY FOR LARGE PROJECTS

01:50:52.912 --> 01:50:54.414
GOING FROM TWO TO FIVE IS

01:50:54.481 --> 01:50:57.017
DEFINITELY BETTER -- WE DO NOT

01:50:57.083 --> 01:50:58.284
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH A MALE A

01:50:58.351 --> 01:51:00.787
MAXIMUM OF TWELVE MONTHS FOR THE

01:51:00.854 --> 01:51:01.921
PERMIT STREAMLINING ACT.

01:51:01.988 --> 01:51:03.156
BUT THAT'S BETTER THAN AN

01:51:03.223 --> 01:51:04.491
ARBITRARY LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF

01:51:04.557 --> 01:51:05.692
HEARINGS VERTICALLY FOR LARGE

01:51:05.759 --> 01:51:07.660
PROJECTS IN PARTICULAR WHEN

01:51:07.727 --> 01:51:09.396
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:51:09.462 --> 01:51:10.597
YOU'RE HEARING TO SEE BECAUSE

YOU DON'T END UP IN COURT.

01:51:11.798 --> 01:51:13.733
SO THOSE ARE THE CAN SCAN

01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:20.940
TENURED ISSUES THAT WE HAVE.

01:51:21.007 --> 01:51:24.744

THE INTENTION OF YOUR BILL

01:54:31.798 --> 01:54:33.666
BECAUSE AS I READ IT THE WHOLE

01:54:33.733 --> 01:54:35.235
PURPOSE MAN I RAN A A BILL

01:54:35.301 --> 01:54:36.736
SIMILAR I THINK YOU DID IT MUCH

01:54:36.803 --> 01:54:40.406
MORE ELOQUENTLY IN YOUR BILL --

01:54:40.473 --> 01:54:43.076
THAN I DID LAST YEAR -- BUT THE

01:54:43.142 --> 01:54:45.211
INTENTION IS THAT YOU KNOW GOING

01:54:45.278 --> 01:54:46.646
IN WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST YOU

01:54:46.713 --> 01:54:48.381

DOESN'T SPIRAL AND SKYROCKET --

01:54:53.186 --> 01:54:54.354
BASED ON JUST.

01:54:54.420 --> 01:54:55.922

YOUR ANALYSIS IN REGARDS TO

01:55:02.962 --> 01:55:04.097
WOULD.

01:55:04.163 --> 01:55:05.398
PROHIBIT.

01:55:05.465 --> 01:55:07.800

THESE BILLS FOR US AND TO THE

01:55:20.146 --> 01:55:21.914
EXPERTS THAT I'VE INTERACTED

01:55:21.981 --> 01:55:26.486
WITH. TO DESIGN THIS BILL -- IT

01:55:26.552 --> 01:55:28.454
WAS NEVER OUR INTENTION TO

01:55:28.521 --> 01:55:29.756
PRECLUDE INCLUSIONARY HOUSING

01:55:29.822 --> 01:55:31.391
AND IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

01:55:31.457 --> 01:55:32.558
DOES NOT.

01:55:32.625 --> 01:55:35.561
SO UNTIL.

01:55:35.628 --> 01:55:40.066
AM THE THE LEAGUE OF CITIES

01:55:40.133 --> 01:55:41.567
ASSERTED THIS IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:55:41.634 --> 01:55:42.769
SAN FINANCE COMMITTEE I WENT

01:55:42.835 --> 01:55:45.905
BACK TO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO --

01:55:45.972 --> 01:55:47.707
HELPED CONSTRUCT THE BILL TO DO

01:55:47.774 --> 01:55:51.444
TO GET THEIR OPINION AS TO

01:55:51.511 --> 01:55:52.345
WHETHER IT.

01:55:52.412 --> 01:55:53.012
PRECLUDED EXCLUSION INCLUSIONARY

01:55:53.079 --> 01:55:55.248
HOUSING.

01:55:55.315 --> 01:55:57.016
AND THEY ALL SAID NO SO I AM

01:55:57.083 --> 01:55:58.518
HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH THE

01:55:58.584 --> 01:55:59.719
LEAGUE OF CITIES.

01:55:59.786 --> 01:56:01.621
TO TRY TO IDENTIFY IN WHAT WAY

01:56:01.688 --> 01:56:03.189
THEY BELIEVE THAT SO BECAUSE

01:56:03.256 --> 01:56:04.891
EVEN WHEN WE WENT BACK TO LEDGE

01:56:04.957 --> 01:56:07.060
COUNCIL TO GET THEIR OPINION

01:56:07.126 --> 01:56:08.227
THEY WERE LIKE NO DOESN'T.

01:56:08.294 --> 01:56:10.163
SO BUT CLEARLY AS WE KNOW YOU

01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:12.398
GET ANY NUMBER OF LAWYERS IN A

01:56:12.465 --> 01:56:13.566
ROOM THEY'RE GONNA SOMETIMES

01:56:13.633 --> 01:56:15.134
DISAGREE BUT I'M HAPPY TO SIT

01:56:15.201 --> 01:56:16.669
DOWN WITH THEM BECAUSE IT IS NOT

01:56:16.736 --> 01:56:18.037
OUR INTENTION TO PRECLUDE

01:56:18.104 --> 01:56:21.341
INCLUSIONARY HOUSING WHATSOEVER --

01:56:21.407 --> 01:56:25.011
THE FREEZE ON FEES FOR TEN YEARS --

01:56:25.078 --> 01:56:28.281
EASY I CAN APPRECIATE WHY --

01:56:28.348 --> 01:56:30.416
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE CONCERNED

01:56:30.483 --> 01:56:34.120
ABOUT THAT -- BUT IT'S ALSO ONE

01:56:34.187 --> 01:56:36.823
OF THOSE FACTORS WHERE.

01:56:36.889 --> 01:56:38.491
I DIDN'T SEE THIS MY OPENING BUT

01:56:38.558 --> 01:56:39.926
WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR

01:56:39.992 --> 01:56:41.861
JURISDICTIONS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED

01:56:41.928 --> 01:56:43.596
BY FIRE EARTHQUAKE.

01:56:43.663 --> 01:56:46.165
IT IS VERY VERY COMMON AFTER A

01:56:46.232 --> 01:56:48.034
LARGE LOSS OF UNITS DUE TO THESE

01:56:48.101 --> 01:56:49.602
KIND OF DISASTERS THAT THE

01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:51.971
JURISDICTION RELAXES RULES

01:56:52.038 --> 01:56:54.073
SUSPENDS RULES AND LOWERS FEES

01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:55.808
OR FREEZES FEES.

01:56:55.875 --> 01:56:58.411
AGAIN TO HELP GET THAT HOUSING

01:56:58.478 --> 01:56:59.846
REPLACED QUICKLY.

01:56:59.912 --> 01:57:01.814
SO WE ARE IN A WE'VE IN FACT HAD

01:57:01.881 --> 01:57:03.816
A FIRE OVER THE WHOLE STATE EVEN

01:57:03.883 --> 01:57:05.418
THOUGH WE DIDN'T DESTROYER UNITS

01:57:05.485 --> 01:57:06.886
WE DIDN'T BUILD ENOUGH.

01:57:06.953 --> 01:57:09.222
SO MMHM THE APPROACH OF THE BILL

01:57:09.288 --> 01:57:10.656
IS.

01:57:10.723 --> 01:57:12.892
TO WITH HIS TO SAY LOOK LOCAL

01:57:12.959 --> 01:57:14.460
GOVERNMENTS YOU'VE ALREADY DONE

01:57:14.527 --> 01:57:17.029
ALL THIS PLANNING AND ALL THIS --

01:57:17.096 --> 01:57:19.132
DINO SEQUEL WORK EVERYTHING AND

01:57:19.198 --> 01:57:20.967
YOU'VE ALLOWED SO MUCH HOUSING

01:57:21.033 --> 01:57:22.769
BUT THERE'S BUILT IN SO MANY

01:57:22.835 --> 01:57:25.037
DELAYS AND SO MANY COSTS AND SO

01:57:25.104 --> 01:57:26.539
MANY OTHER IMPEDIMENTS.

01:57:26.606 --> 01:57:28.274
IT ISN'T BEING PRODUCED FAST

01:57:28.341 --> 01:57:29.909
ENOUGH AND SINCE WE'RE IN THIS

01:57:29.976 --> 01:57:31.544
HORRIBLE CRISIS LET'S PRODUCE A

01:57:31.611 --> 01:57:33.446
FASTER SO LET'S RELAX THINGS A

01:57:33.513 --> 01:57:34.614
LITTLE BIT.

01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:36.816
AND JUST SPEEDED UP IN JUST FOR

01:57:36.883 --> 01:57:37.950
TEN YEAR PERIOD AND SEE IF WE

01:57:38.017 --> 01:57:39.185
CAN'T GET BACK INTO BALANCE OF

01:57:39.252 --> 01:57:40.653
THAT'S REALLY.

01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:42.088
THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL AND AS

01:57:42.155 --> 01:57:43.756
YOU POINTED OUT CERTAIN OF THESE

01:57:43.823 --> 01:57:46.025
THINGS ALLOW FOR THE PERSON

01:57:46.092 --> 01:57:47.293
BUILDING HOUSING AND I DON'T SEE

01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:49.395
DEVELOPER BECAUSE HE COULD BE

01:57:49.462 --> 01:57:51.297
SOMEBODY JUST OWNS ONE LOT.

01:57:51.364 --> 01:57:56.369
IT YOU KNOW JUST IT ALLOWS THEM

01:57:56.436 --> 01:57:57.236
TO KNOW OKAY.

01:57:57.303 --> 01:57:58.171
I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT

01:57:58.237 --> 01:57:58.938
FIVE YEARS OR TEN YEARS.

01:57:59.005 --> 01:57:59.572
AND THESE NEW THINGS ARE GOING

01:57:59.639 --> 01:58:01.741
TO BE ADDED SO MY COST ESTIMATES

01:58:01.808 --> 01:58:03.943
OTHER THAN IF CONCRETE PRICES GO

01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:06.412
WAY UP OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW MY

01:58:06.479 --> 01:58:06.946
COST ESTIMATES ARE PRETTY

01:58:07.013 --> 01:58:08.681
ACCURATE.

01:58:08.748 --> 01:58:10.850
OKAY SO THEN THE SECOND QUESTION

01:58:10.917 --> 01:58:11.717
I DO YOU MAY HAVE ANSWERED THIS

01:58:11.784 --> 01:58:15.221
IS THAT -- USUALLY IF IF FEES

01:58:15.288 --> 01:58:17.890
ARE GOING TO GO UP YOU'VE DONE

01:58:17.957 --> 01:58:19.492
THE VIEW SPENT AS A PERIOD OF

01:58:19.559 --> 01:58:20.426
TIME.

01:58:20.493 --> 01:58:22.528
UP DOING THE STUDIES RIGHT AND

01:58:22.595 --> 01:58:25.097
YOU CAN SEE THEM COMING AND SO

01:58:25.164 --> 01:58:26.899
THE JURISDICTIONS THAT I WAS

01:58:26.966 --> 01:58:27.767
INVOLVED IN.

01:58:27.834 --> 01:58:29.569
ARE THE JURISDICTIONS IN THE

01:58:29.635 --> 01:58:31.571
REGION WOULD SAY WOULD TELL

01:58:31.637 --> 01:58:32.505
DEVELOPERS GEAR COMING IN WE'RE

01:58:32.572 --> 01:58:34.307
WE'VE GOT THESE NEW TRAFFIC

01:58:34.373 --> 01:58:35.441
IMPACT FEES ARE WE'VE GOT THESE

01:58:35.508 --> 01:58:36.375
THESE NEW.

01:58:36.442 --> 01:58:38.911
PARK FEES OR WHATEVER AND BOB

01:58:38.978 --> 01:58:39.512
YOU'RE GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO

01:58:39.579 --> 01:58:41.581
THEM AT AND IF YOU DON'T GET IT

01:58:41.647 --> 01:58:43.182
DONE BY IF YOU DON'T A STARTED

01:58:43.249 --> 01:58:45.551
BY A CERTAIN DATE -- ADMITS

01:58:45.618 --> 01:58:46.719
ASSUMING THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

01:58:46.786 --> 01:58:51.691
INTENDING TO TO FREEZE FOR THOSE

01:58:51.757 --> 01:58:52.925
THAT TEN YEAR PERIOD.

01:58:52.992 --> 01:58:53.960
YES AND THE OTHER THING I WOULD

01:58:54.026 --> 01:58:54.627
NOTE IS THAT IF WE LOOK AT THE

01:58:54.694 --> 01:58:56.028
BUDGET THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:58:56.095 --> 01:58:58.564
CURRENTLY -- PUT BEFORE US WOULD

01:58:58.631 --> 01:58:59.932
NOT ADOPTED IT YET.

01:58:59.999 --> 01:59:02.268
BUT HE IS OFFERING LOCAL

01:59:02.335 --> 01:59:05.404
GOVERNMENTS -- HE'S HE'S

01:59:05.471 --> 01:59:07.340
OFFERING STATE MONEY INVESTMENT

01:59:07.406 --> 01:59:09.642
FOR THEM TO BRING.

01:59:09.709 --> 01:59:13.112
THEIR THEIR PERMIT PROCESS SEES

01:59:13.179 --> 01:59:14.080
TO BRING VARIOUS PLANNING PRESS

01:59:14.146 --> 01:59:16.482
SEIZE UP TO DATE IN ORDER TO

01:59:16.549 --> 01:59:17.917
FACILITATE HOUSING.

01:59:17.984 --> 01:59:18.818
SO.

01:59:18.885 --> 01:59:21.487
WHILE IT MAY NOT MEET

01:59:21.554 --> 01:59:21.787
[inaudible]

01:59:21.854 --> 01:59:25.057
THE WHAT A LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:59:25.124 --> 01:59:26.659
MIGHT WANT TO INCREASE THE FEE

01:59:26.726 --> 01:59:27.793
FOR OVER THIS TEN YEAR PERIOD

01:59:27.860 --> 01:59:29.795
IT'S CERTAINLY THE STATE IS NOT

01:59:29.862 --> 01:59:31.130
ABANDONING THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

01:59:31.197 --> 01:59:33.299
WERE OFFERING IF WE ADOPT THAT.

01:59:33.366 --> 01:59:34.767
WE ARE OFFERING THEM SOME

01:59:34.834 --> 01:59:35.801
SUPPORT.

01:59:35.868 --> 01:59:37.537
AGAIN TO TRY TO FACILITATE

01:59:37.603 --> 01:59:41.240
HOUSING.

01:59:41.307 --> 01:59:42.542

IT'S A GOOD BILL I ENCOURAGE YOU --

01:59:46.579 --> 01:59:47.413
TO OF WORK ON SOME OF THESE

01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:49.448
DETAILS I THINK THEY'RE THE

01:59:49.515 --> 01:59:52.351
RESOLVABLE -- AND I BUT WHEN

01:59:52.418 --> 01:59:52.919
IT'S APPROPRIATE I'D LIKE TO

01:59:52.985 --> 01:59:54.987
MOVE THE BILL.

01:59:55.054 --> 01:59:56.355
THANK YOU AT COLLEAGUES ANY

01:59:56.422 --> 01:59:57.924
OTHER COMMON CENTER BATES I DO

NOT HAVE AND I AM HAD PROBLEMS

02:00:00.092 --> 02:00:01.460
WITH A NUMBER OF THE HOUSING.

02:00:01.527 --> 02:00:03.496
BILLS THAT HAVE FUN REDUCE

02:00:03.563 --> 02:00:05.631
PARKING REQUIRES BECAUSE IN MY

02:00:05.698 --> 02:00:10.169
COMMUNITY -- PUBLIC SAFETY

02:00:10.236 --> 02:00:11.504
BECAME A BIG ISSUE WITH.

02:00:11.571 --> 02:00:12.371
LOWERING OF PARKING REQUIREMENTS

02:00:12.438 --> 02:00:13.506
ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHERE THERE

02:00:13.573 --> 02:00:14.574
A LOT OF CHILDREN.

02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:16.042
AND PEOPLE PARK THEIR CARS AND

02:00:16.108 --> 02:00:18.177
THE KIDS GO BETWEEN HIM AND WE

02:00:18.244 --> 02:00:19.412
HAD TWO VERY UNFORTUNATE.

02:00:19.478 --> 02:00:20.446
DEATHS OF CHILDREN IN OUR

02:00:20.513 --> 02:00:22.181
COMMUNITY OVER THE YEARS BECAUSE

02:00:22.248 --> 02:00:24.417
OF THAT SO THING VERY ODD THING

02:00:24.483 --> 02:00:26.652
COMFORTABLE MAKING IT KIND OF

02:00:26.719 --> 02:00:27.520
COOKIE CUTTER.

02:00:27.587 --> 02:00:29.088
A SECOND LEAD THE DEVELOPMENT

02:00:29.155 --> 02:00:30.756
IMPACT FEES THAT I REMEMBER WE

02:00:30.823 --> 02:00:32.959
IMPOSE STYLE OUT THE COUNTY.

02:00:33.025 --> 02:00:37.163
OF ORANGE HAD A LOT TO DO WITH

02:00:37.229 --> 02:00:39.098
THE RISING COST OF EMPLOYEES

02:00:39.165 --> 02:00:40.299
ESPECIALLY IN CODE ENFORCEMENT

02:00:40.366 --> 02:00:41.567
WHERE YOU HAVE TO EXPAND IN AN

02:00:41.634 --> 02:00:42.435
S. WERE INCREASING THE

02:00:42.501 --> 02:00:44.403
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE BUILDING OF

02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:45.137
HOUSING YOU'RE GONNA NEED MORE

02:00:45.204 --> 02:00:46.706
CODE ENFORCERS.

02:00:46.772 --> 02:00:47.807
AND CERTAINLY THE LOW SALARIES

02:00:47.873 --> 02:00:49.609
REYES AND OVER TEN YEARS I WOULD

02:00:49.675 --> 02:00:51.243
HOPE THAT THIS STUDY IS GOING TO

02:00:51.310 --> 02:00:52.612
LOOK AT SOMETHING THAT IS

02:00:52.678 --> 02:00:54.647
COMPARABLE TO HOW THE US

02:00:54.714 --> 02:00:56.816
INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY COSTS

02:00:56.882 --> 02:00:58.384
ACOSTA LAW ENFORCEMENT.

02:00:58.451 --> 02:01:00.286
WHEN YOU HAVE A MULTI MULTI

02:01:00.353 --> 02:01:01.153
FAMILY?

02:01:01.220 --> 02:01:02.989
THE FEES REALLY REFLECT THE NEED

02:01:03.055 --> 02:01:04.457
FOR MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT IN

02:01:04.523 --> 02:01:06.058
THOSE COMMUNITIES TO ENSURE THAT

02:01:06.125 --> 02:01:07.627
PEOPLE ARE ABIDING BY THE LAWS

02:01:07.693 --> 02:01:09.295
NO PARKING ALL OF THAT.

02:01:09.362 --> 02:01:11.163
HELLO SIR -- SIGNIFICANT

02:01:11.230 --> 02:01:12.999
CONCERNS THAT I HAVE WITH A

02:01:13.065 --> 02:01:14.900
COOKIE CUTTER APPROACH THAT

02:01:14.967 --> 02:01:16.469
IMPLIED THAT MANDATES THIS ON

02:01:16.535 --> 02:01:18.604
ALL CITIES BECAUSE THEY ARE

02:01:18.671 --> 02:01:20.706
QUITE DIFFERENT -- SO I I HOLD

02:01:20.773 --> 02:01:22.174
THAT'LL BE SOME FLEXIBILITY AS

02:01:22.241 --> 02:01:24.143
WE GO FORWARD PUBLIC SAFETY IS

02:01:24.210 --> 02:01:26.879
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST ISSUE LOCAL.

02:01:26.946 --> 02:01:28.748
COMMUNITIES I AND THAT'S WHERE

02:01:28.814 --> 02:01:30.616
HUGE COSTS ARE NOW PUTTING MANY

02:01:30.683 --> 02:01:32.418
OF OUR CITIES IN JEOPARDY AND

02:01:32.485 --> 02:01:34.453
THE IMPACT FEES ARE SPECIFICALLY

02:01:34.520 --> 02:01:35.588
TO HELP OUT.

02:01:35.655 --> 02:01:37.523
SO -- YOU NEED TO TAKE I THINK A

02:01:37.590 --> 02:01:39.258
DEEPER DIVE ON THAT AND I KNOW

02:01:39.325 --> 02:01:41.160
WHEN THE CITY COMES FORWARD.

02:01:41.227 --> 02:01:43.295
THE INFLATIONARY -- YOU KNOW

02:01:43.362 --> 02:01:44.697
INDEX IS GOING TO HELP WITH THAT.

02:01:44.764 --> 02:01:46.999
BUT THIS IS PRETTY FAR REACHING

02:01:47.066 --> 02:01:48.868
OUT LASTLY MY HUSBAND'S AN

02:01:48.934 --> 02:01:50.936
ARCHITECT HAS DONE A LOT OF

02:01:51.003 --> 02:01:52.371
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS

02:01:52.438 --> 02:01:54.874
IN TO ENSURE THOSE DO NOT BECOME.

02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:57.076
GATAL LIKE AMENITIES ARE VERY

02:01:57.143 --> 02:01:58.678
IMPORTANT -- OTHERWISE YOU

02:01:58.744 --> 02:02:00.279
CREATE CONCRETE JUNGLES NAY

02:02:00.346 --> 02:02:01.547
WITHOUT SOME WAY BACK WHEN AND

02:02:01.614 --> 02:02:03.115
THAT THAT'S WHAT THE BECAME I

02:02:03.182 --> 02:02:05.051
WORK THE PROJECTS IN LA FOR AT

02:02:05.117 --> 02:02:05.751
LEAST.

02:02:05.818 --> 02:02:07.386
YOU KNOW WHAT FIVE SIX YEARS

02:02:07.453 --> 02:02:08.854
WHEN I WAS SOCIAL WORKER AND

02:02:08.921 --> 02:02:10.656
THOSE PROJECTS NEEDED MANY MORE

02:02:10.723 --> 02:02:12.725
AMENITIES SO THAT YOU HAD.

02:02:12.792 --> 02:02:14.160
MORE ON A HIGHER STANDARD OF

02:02:14.226 --> 02:02:15.461
LIVING SO WHEN YOU START

02:02:15.528 --> 02:02:17.830
CREATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:02:17.897 --> 02:02:19.532
PROJECTS THAT HAVE NO AMENITIES

02:02:19.598 --> 02:02:21.167
BECAUSE YOU'VE TAKEN AWAY IMPACT

02:02:21.233 --> 02:02:22.968
FEES YOU'RE STARTING TO CREATE.

02:02:23.035 --> 02:02:24.870
A PROBLEM GOING FORWARD AND THAT

02:02:24.937 --> 02:02:26.672
REALLY NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT

02:02:26.739 --> 02:02:29.308
FINALLY THE ODD DESIGN STANDARDS

02:02:29.375 --> 02:02:31.077
WE'VE JUST IMPOSE A LOT OF

02:02:31.143 --> 02:02:33.479
DESIGN STANDARDS BECAUSE OF

02:02:33.546 --> 02:02:35.247
CLIMATE CHANGE WE WE REQUIRING

02:02:35.314 --> 02:02:44.957
SOLAR AND WE KNOW THAT

02:02:45.024 --> 02:02:45.691
1-500-022-0000 DOLLARS IN UNIT.

02:02:45.758 --> 02:02:46.425
THAT FOUGHT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

02:02:46.492 --> 02:02:48.427
CONSIDERED -- IN THIS BILL AND I

02:02:48.494 --> 02:02:49.428
THINK YOU KNOW THEY'RE ALMOST

02:02:49.495 --> 02:02:51.163
GOT CONTRADICTORY IF YOU WANT

02:02:51.230 --> 02:02:52.965
DESIGN STANDARDS THAT OF THAT

02:02:53.032 --> 02:02:53.766
ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE.

02:02:53.833 --> 02:02:54.500
HIM THEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE

02:02:54.567 --> 02:02:55.568
THOSE ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR

02:02:55.634 --> 02:02:56.736
THEY PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT

02:02:56.802 --> 02:02:57.203
OUT.

02:02:57.269 --> 02:02:59.705
SO THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS I'M

02:02:59.772 --> 02:03:01.907
GONNA VOTE NO TODAY.

02:03:01.974 --> 02:03:02.575
BUT I KNOW EVERYONE'S WORKING IN

02:03:02.641 --> 02:03:03.209
THE RIGHT DIRECTION TRYING TO

02:03:03.275 --> 02:03:04.577
CREATE MORE HOUSING SO I JUST

02:03:04.643 --> 02:03:05.377
LIKE YOU TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF

02:03:05.444 --> 02:03:06.312
THOSE.

02:03:06.378 --> 02:03:08.447
RATHER RIGID COOKIE CUTTER KIND

02:03:08.514 --> 02:03:10.149
OF APPROACHES TO WHAT WE'RE

02:03:10.216 --> 02:03:11.784
TRYING TO DO TO DEVELOP MORE

02:03:11.851 --> 02:03:15.755
MULTI FAMILY HOUSING THINKS WHAT

02:03:15.821 --> 02:03:18.057
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:03:18.124 --> 02:03:18.424
HERE THANK YOU.

02:03:18.491 --> 02:03:19.725
SO FIRST THE BILL DOES NOT

02:03:19.792 --> 02:03:20.726
AFFECT EVERY.

02:03:20.793 --> 02:03:22.361
AREA EVERY GEOGRAPHIC AREA IN

02:03:22.428 --> 02:03:23.562
THE STATE.

02:03:23.629 --> 02:03:25.898
THE IT'S TARGETED AND I'M

02:03:25.965 --> 02:03:27.700
POLICIES THAT I DID NOTSPECIFY

02:03:27.767 --> 02:03:30.336
THAT IT IS TARGETED AND ELLIE --

02:03:30.402 --> 02:03:33.139
HAS CREATED A EXCEL SPREADSHEET

02:03:33.205 --> 02:03:34.039
FOR US.

02:03:34.106 --> 02:03:35.508
THAT I CAN SHARE WITH ANY

02:03:35.574 --> 02:03:37.977
OFFICES THAT CHOOSE -- TO THAT

02:03:38.043 --> 02:03:39.912
WOULD SHOW WHAT TIMES

02:03:39.979 --> 02:03:42.081
COMMUNITIES WOULD BE AFFECTED

02:03:42.148 --> 02:03:44.183
AND THE CRITERIA ARE.

02:03:44.250 --> 02:03:45.384
VACANCY RATE.

02:03:45.451 --> 02:03:47.153
SO VERY VERY LOW VACANCY RATES

02:03:47.219 --> 02:03:50.723
AND THEN THE EITHER HOUSING THE

02:03:50.790 --> 02:03:53.058
EITHER PRICE OF HOMES FOR RENTAL

02:03:53.125 --> 02:03:55.494
INCREASE PERCENT INCREASE SO HE

02:03:55.561 --> 02:03:57.196
REALLY IS TARGETED TOWARDS THOSE

02:03:57.263 --> 02:03:59.098
AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN AFFECTED

02:03:59.165 --> 02:04:00.699
THE MOST BY COST.

02:04:00.766 --> 02:04:03.002
AND VACANCY AND IT IT WOULD

02:04:03.068 --> 02:04:05.571
AFFECT THOSE SECONDARILY.

02:04:05.638 --> 02:04:07.640
IT RESPECTS THE DESIGN REVIEW

02:04:07.706 --> 02:04:08.140
STANDARDS AT THE LOCAL

02:04:08.207 --> 02:04:09.675
GOVERNMENT ALREADY YES IT DOES

02:04:09.742 --> 02:04:11.544
NOT REVERSE THOSE AT ALL SO WHEN

02:04:11.610 --> 02:04:12.745
YOU DESIGN REVIEW THAT LOCAL

02:04:12.812 --> 02:04:14.547
GOVERNMENTS HAVE FOR AFFORDABLE

02:04:14.613 --> 02:04:16.649
HOUSING WOULD STAY INTACT -- IT

02:04:16.715 --> 02:04:19.118
ALSO REFLECTS RESPECTS ALL OF

02:04:19.185 --> 02:04:21.153
THE IMPACT FEES THAT ARE EXIST

02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:23.289
RIGHT NOW WOULD ONLY BE ONCE IT

02:04:23.355 --> 02:04:25.324
WENT INTO EFFECT FOR THAT SUNSET

02:04:25.391 --> 02:04:28.561
PERIOD DO NOT INCREASE THEM --

02:04:28.627 --> 02:04:31.263
IT IN THE PARKING MINIMUM THIS

02:04:31.330 --> 02:04:32.364
ONE EIGHT EIGHT SO -- IT'S ONE

02:04:32.431 --> 02:04:36.402
OF THOSE HARD ONES WERE THE BILL

02:04:36.468 --> 02:04:37.770
DOES NOT FOR BID PARKING.

02:04:37.837 --> 02:04:39.104
AND WITH THE AMENDMENTS WITH

02:04:39.171 --> 02:04:40.172
GOVERNMENT AND FINANCE IT ONLY

02:04:40.239 --> 02:04:42.374
LISTS THE REQUIRED PARKING

02:04:42.441 --> 02:04:44.443
MINIMUM WITHIN A QUARTER MILE OF

02:04:44.510 --> 02:04:46.345
TRANSIT.

02:04:46.412 --> 02:04:48.314
AND IT EXEMPTS SMALL AND RURAL

02:04:48.380 --> 02:04:50.516
CITIES SO ANYWHERE ELSE THE

02:04:50.583 --> 02:04:52.518
PARKING MINIMUM STAY NOW I WOULD

02:04:52.585 --> 02:04:55.187
HAVE PREFERRED TO LIFT THE

02:04:55.254 --> 02:04:56.355
PARKING MINIMUMS.

02:04:56.422 --> 02:04:58.224
WHICH WOULD STILL ALLOW IF

02:04:58.290 --> 02:04:59.558
YOU'RE BUILDING THE HOUSING AND

02:04:59.625 --> 02:05:00.993
YOU FEEL THAT YOU MUST HAVE THAT

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:03.796
PARKING IT WOULD STILL ALLOW YOU

02:05:03.863 --> 02:05:04.897
TO PUT THAT PARKING IN.

02:05:04.964 --> 02:05:06.732
THE CHEST WOULD BE IF YOU WERE

02:05:06.799 --> 02:05:08.701
BUILDING HOUSING AND FELT THAT

02:05:08.767 --> 02:05:10.736
THE HOUSING COULD -- BE

02:05:10.803 --> 02:05:12.438
SUPPORTED WITHOUT THE PARKING

02:05:12.504 --> 02:05:14.640
BUT AS GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE

02:05:14.707 --> 02:05:16.075
WHICH I'VE.

02:05:16.141 --> 02:05:18.911
ACCEPTED IT IS NOW ONLY WITHIN A

02:05:18.978 --> 02:05:21.113
QUARTER MILE OF TRANSIT AND ITS

02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:24.250
HIGH FREQUENCY TRANSIT SO --

02:05:24.316 --> 02:05:25.784
THAT MAY NOT ADDRESS ALL OF YOUR

02:05:25.851 --> 02:05:28.320
CONCERNS BUT AT LEAST I WANTED

02:05:28.387 --> 02:05:30.189
TO LAY THOSE OUT BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:05:30.256 --> 02:05:31.957
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN --

02:05:32.024 --> 02:05:33.893
WAS CHARACTERIZED.

02:05:33.959 --> 02:05:34.593

BILL FORWARD I THINK ONE OF THE

02:05:51.076 --> 02:05:53.045
MOST COMMON CRITICS OF BILLS

02:05:53.112 --> 02:05:55.848
AGAIN THE LEGISLATURE -- WHICH I

02:05:55.915 --> 02:05:57.283
THINK IS ALSO ONE OF CRITIQUE

02:05:57.349 --> 02:05:59.051
THAT I HOPE WE DO AWAY WITH ONE

02:05:59.118 --> 02:06:01.487
DAY AS WELL THIS BILL REALLY

02:06:01.553 --> 02:06:02.588

02:06:02.655 --> 02:06:04.156
AND A AND MEN AS A CRITICISM

02:06:04.223 --> 02:06:06.525
SOMETIMES WHILE YOUR BILL DOES A

02:06:06.592 --> 02:06:07.192
LOT OF STUFF.

02:06:07.259 --> 02:06:08.594
AS YOU THINK IT'S A COMPLIMENT --

02:06:08.661 --> 02:06:09.695

02:06:09.762 --> 02:06:11.530

SPECIFIC -- SOMETIMES ABUSES.

02:06:19.939 --> 02:06:21.273
IN THE CASE OF PUTTING A HOUSING

02:06:21.340 --> 02:06:25.377
MORATORIUM OR A POPULATION COP

02:06:25.444 --> 02:06:25.644
IT CETERA.

02:06:25.711 --> 02:06:28.080

SUGGEST I KNOW THAT THE

02:07:15.494 --> 02:07:16.428
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS

02:07:16.495 --> 02:07:17.663
INCLUDE THESE BIG POTS OF MONEY

02:07:17.730 --> 02:07:18.430
THAT WERE A LOT OF DETAIL HAS

02:07:18.497 --> 02:07:19.565
NOT BEEN INCLUDED.

02:07:19.631 --> 02:07:20.632
AND I RAISE THE ISSUE UNDER THE

02:07:20.699 --> 02:07:22.368
OF THE CATEGORY OF INCENTIVIZING

02:07:22.434 --> 02:07:23.602
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:26.005
THIS MADE AND I'M TRYING TO PUSH

02:07:26.071 --> 02:07:27.506
FOR THAT THE INCENTIVES SHOULD

02:07:27.573 --> 02:07:30.943
BE CONNECTED TO HOUSING NOT JUST

02:07:31.010 --> 02:07:31.844
FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REAL TO

02:07:31.910 --> 02:07:33.645
USE THAT WHATEVER HOWEVER THEY

02:07:33.712 --> 02:07:34.346
WANT.

02:07:34.413 --> 02:07:35.581

02:07:35.647 --> 02:07:38.417
CONNECTED TO THE HOUSING. TO BE

02:07:38.484 --> 02:07:40.019
ABLE TO ALLOW MORE HOUSING SO I

02:07:40.085 --> 02:07:42.688
THINK THE FEES ISSUE HERE.

02:07:42.755 --> 02:07:45.124
COULD BE ONE OF THOSE WAYS IN

02:07:45.190 --> 02:07:47.626
WHICH THE INCENTIVES TO LOCAL

02:07:47.693 --> 02:07:49.628

PARTNERSHIPS WHERE -- WE

02:30:56.180 --> 02:30:57.615

ILLUSTRATE THE FACT THAT HOUSING

02:30:59.216 --> 02:31:00.951

LOOK AT A CLINICAL TRIAL THERE'S

02:31:02.853 --> 02:31:04.588
NO DRUGS THERE'S NO PROCEDURE.

02:31:04.655 --> 02:31:05.322
THAT'S BETTER THAN HAVING

02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:07.558
HOUSING PERSONS OF INCIDENCE OF

02:31:07.625 --> 02:31:09.794

I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE DATA

02:31:19.937 --> 02:31:21.472

AS A BASE FOR WHERE PERHAPS CMS

02:31:26.110 --> 02:31:27.044
THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE

02:31:27.111 --> 02:31:28.646
MEDICAID STUDIES COULD SEE.

02:31:28.712 --> 02:31:31.048

DOLLARS TOWARDS HOUSING AS A

02:31:33.150 --> 02:31:34.752
SUBSIDY SO I THINK THE

02:59:14.076 --> 02:59:16.612
ANY OPPOSITION.

02:59:16.679 --> 02:59:32.995
PLEASE COME FORWARD

02:59:46.976 --> 02:59:47.042
.

02:59:47.042 --> 02:59:49.211
SENATOR WIENER AND MEMBERS OF

02:59:49.278 --> 02:59:49.845
THE COMMITTEE I MARJORIE MURRAY

02:59:49.912 --> 02:59:50.913
AGAIN.

02:59:50.980 --> 02:59:53.115
CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS

02:59:53.182 --> 02:59:55.251
ASSOCIATION LAW -- HAS HAS BEEN

02:59:55.317 --> 02:59:56.886
MENTIONED THIS IS NOT THE FIRST

02:59:56.952 --> 02:59:59.421
TIME THAT THIS IDEA HAS BEEN.

02:59:59.488 --> 03:00:00.823
BROUGHT TO THE LEGISLATURE I

03:00:00.890 --> 03:00:02.391
THINK THIS IS THE FOURTH OR

03:00:02.458 --> 03:00:05.294
FIFTH ITERATION OF THIS IDEA.

03:00:05.361 --> 03:00:07.296
THAT THE ACCLAMATION CAN BE THE

03:00:07.363 --> 03:00:10.766
TOOL FOR SEATING BOARD DIRECTORS.

03:00:10.833 --> 03:00:13.402
AND WE HAVE THE SAME OBJECTIONS

03:00:13.469 --> 03:00:16.038
TO THIS BILL AS WE HAVE HAD IN

03:00:16.105 --> 03:00:16.639
THE PAST.

03:00:16.705 --> 03:00:19.074
I ONE OF STRESS JUST ONE POINT

03:00:19.141 --> 03:00:22.611
ABOUT HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS.

03:00:22.678 --> 03:00:23.412
WHICH I'VE ALSO MADE IN OUR

03:00:23.479 --> 03:00:24.480
LETTER.

03:00:24.547 --> 03:00:25.915
AND THAT IS THAT HOMEOWNER

03:00:25.981 --> 03:00:27.716
ASSOCIATIONS ARE NOT COUNTRY

03:00:27.783 --> 03:00:28.751
CLUBS.

03:00:28.817 --> 03:00:29.685
THEY'RE NOT NEIGHBORHOOD

03:00:29.752 --> 03:00:31.720
ASSOCIATION SAID PUT ON FOURTH

03:00:31.787 --> 03:00:34.356
OF JULY PICNICS THIS IS ANOTHER

03:00:34.423 --> 03:00:35.991
LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT LIKE A

03:00:36.058 --> 03:00:37.993
SPECIAL DISTRICT OR A SCHOOL

03:00:38.060 --> 03:00:40.496
BOARD OR A CITY COUNCIL OR A

03:00:40.563 --> 03:00:42.464
COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN

03:00:42.531 --> 03:00:44.033
FACT SOME OF THEIR POWERS.

03:00:44.099 --> 03:00:46.101
EXCEED THOSE OF LOCAL

03:00:46.168 --> 03:00:48.470
GOVERNMENTS THE MOST OBVIOUS ONE

03:00:48.537 --> 03:00:50.406
BEING THE ASSOCIATION'S RIGHT

03:00:50.472 --> 03:00:52.908
BEFORE CLOSE ON SOMEONE WHO

03:00:52.975 --> 03:00:53.576
FALLS BEHIND.

03:00:53.642 --> 03:00:57.012
ON ASSOCIATION ASSESSMENTS.

03:00:57.079 --> 03:00:58.280
BECAUSE OF THEIR GOVERNMENTAL

03:00:58.347 --> 03:00:59.782
POWERS.

03:00:59.848 --> 03:01:02.718
THE EXISTING STATUTES GOVERNING

03:01:02.785 --> 03:01:04.653
ASSOCIATION ELECTIONS ARE

03:01:04.720 --> 03:01:07.556
MODELED ON THE CALIFORNIA

03:01:07.623 --> 03:01:09.391
ELECTIONS COLD AND WITH GOOD

03:01:09.458 --> 03:01:10.392
REASON.

03:01:10.459 --> 03:01:12.528
AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE POWERS

03:01:12.595 --> 03:01:17.399
INVESTED IN ASSOCIATION BOARDS.

03:01:17.466 --> 03:01:20.436
ONE OF THE ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE

03:01:20.502 --> 03:01:23.906
BEEN THAT HAS BEEN PUT FORWARD.

03:01:23.973 --> 03:01:26.308
FOR ACCLAMATION IS THAT SCHOOL

03:01:26.375 --> 03:01:28.410
BOARD TO USE A SPECIAL DISTRICTS

03:01:28.477 --> 03:01:32.314
USE THE CITY COUNCIL'S USER.

03:01:32.381 --> 03:01:36.318
THAT IS AN INEXACT ANALOGY. FOR

03:01:36.385 --> 03:01:41.123
ONE THING QUALIFICATIONS AGAIN

03:01:41.190 --> 03:01:43.225
FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SPECIAL

03:01:43.292 --> 03:01:44.560
THE SCHOOL BOARDS AND SPECIAL

03:01:44.627 --> 03:01:46.462
DISTRICTS AND SO ON THOSE ARE

03:01:46.528 --> 03:01:47.997
SET BY.

03:01:48.063 --> 03:01:50.866
LAW THOSE ARE SET BY STATUTE.

03:01:50.933 --> 03:01:52.301
WHEREAS IN THE HOMEOWNER

03:01:52.368 --> 03:01:53.702
ASSOCIATION ENVIRONMENT

03:01:53.769 --> 03:01:55.904
QUALIFICATIONS ARE SET BY THE

03:01:55.971 --> 03:01:57.840
INCUMBENTS WHO ARE ALREADY

03:01:57.906 --> 03:01:58.774
SITTING.

03:01:58.841 --> 03:02:00.576
ON THE BOARD.

03:02:00.643 --> 03:02:02.544
THIS IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE WHICH

03:02:02.611 --> 03:02:05.014
MY COLLEAGUE TOM SERVER WILL

03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:07.082
ADDRESS AND A LITTLE BIT MORE IN

03:02:07.149 --> 03:02:08.050
DETAIL.

03:02:08.117 --> 03:02:10.386
A SECOND IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE IS

03:02:10.452 --> 03:02:14.189
THAT THE ELECTIONS IN THE PUBLIC

03:02:14.256 --> 03:02:15.357
ARENA.

03:02:15.424 --> 03:02:17.660
ARE EXECUTED BY A REGISTRAR OF

03:02:17.726 --> 03:02:20.129
VOTERS A DISINTERESTED THIRD

03:02:20.195 --> 03:02:21.630
PARTY THEY ARE NOT.

03:02:21.697 --> 03:02:24.967
EXECUTED BY AGAIN THE INCUMBENTS

03:02:25.034 --> 03:02:27.169
WHICH IS A SITUATION AND THE

03:02:27.236 --> 03:02:29.672
HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATION.

03:02:29.738 --> 03:02:30.472
SO.

03:02:30.539 --> 03:02:32.908
I GUESS THE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE

03:02:32.975 --> 03:02:35.411
HERE IS THAT.

03:02:35.477 --> 03:02:37.379
AS THE BILL IS WRITTEN THE

03:02:37.446 --> 03:02:40.182
DECISION TO SEAT BOARD DIRECTORS

03:02:40.249 --> 03:02:43.052
BY ACCLAMATION IS A PRIVATE.

03:02:43.118 --> 03:02:45.020
ONE MEANING IT'S MADE BY THE

03:02:45.087 --> 03:02:46.922
INSPECTOR OF ELECTIONS TOGETHER

03:02:46.989 --> 03:02:48.924
WITH THE BOARD THERE IS NO

03:02:48.991 --> 03:02:51.160
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE ELECTORATE.

03:02:51.226 --> 03:02:54.196
TO DISAGREE TO OBJECT TO DEMAND

03:02:54.263 --> 03:02:55.931
THE ELECTION AS THEY THEY HAVE

03:02:55.998 --> 03:02:59.168
THAT RIGHT WITH A SCHOOL BOARD.

03:02:59.234 --> 03:03:01.737
SO HOW WE ASK FOR A NO VOTE ON

03:03:01.804 --> 03:03:03.872
THIS BECAUSE OF THE POWERS

03:03:03.939 --> 03:03:07.609
INVESTED IN AN ASSOCIATION BOARD.

03:03:07.676 --> 03:03:09.411
AND BECAUSE WE HAVE CATALOGUED

03:03:09.478 --> 03:03:10.679
TOO MANY INSTANCES OF

03:03:10.746 --> 03:03:12.481
INDIVIDUALS PUTTING THEMSELVES

03:03:12.548 --> 03:03:15.484
FORWARD. TO RUN FOR A BOARD BUT

03:03:15.551 --> 03:03:16.785
BECAUSE THE BOARD SETS THE

03:03:16.852 --> 03:03:18.620
QUALIFICATIONS THEY ARE TOO

03:03:18.687 --> 03:03:20.522
EASILY DISMISSED.

03:03:20.589 --> 03:03:22.024
MY COLLEAGUE TOM SERVER WILL

03:03:22.091 --> 03:03:23.359
ADDRESS A COUPLE OF OTHER ISSUES

03:03:23.425 --> 03:03:26.962
HERE AND ONE IS THE COST ISSUE.

03:03:27.029 --> 03:03:27.930
THANK YOU AND AGAIN TIME SIR I'M

03:03:27.996 --> 03:03:30.265
ON THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE AT

03:03:30.332 --> 03:03:31.166
THE CENTER.

03:03:31.233 --> 03:03:33.402
GOING ON SEVEN YEARS AND SO I

03:03:33.469 --> 03:03:34.536
CAN TELL YOU.

03:03:34.603 --> 03:03:36.171
THAT THE POSITIONS AT THE CENTER

03:03:36.238 --> 03:03:37.539
TAKES.

03:03:37.606 --> 03:03:39.742
ON LEGISLATION EITHER IN SUPPORT

03:03:39.808 --> 03:03:41.076
OR IN OPPOSITION.

03:03:41.143 --> 03:03:43.712
THOSE POSITIONS ARE BASED ON THE

03:03:43.779 --> 03:03:46.215
INFORMATION THE COMPLAINTS THE

03:03:46.281 --> 03:03:47.750
COMMENTS THAT WE RECEIVED FROM

03:03:47.816 --> 03:03:50.719
HOMEOWNERS ALL AROUND THE STATE.

03:03:50.786 --> 03:03:52.054
AND THEY HAVE BROUGHT TO OUR

03:03:52.121 --> 03:03:54.356
ATTENTION REPEATEDLY.

03:03:54.423 --> 03:03:56.425
THAT IN MANY HOMEOWNER

03:03:56.492 --> 03:03:58.894
ASSOCIATIONS AROUND THE STATE.

03:03:58.961 --> 03:04:00.195
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT THE

03:04:00.262 --> 03:04:01.864
SPONSOR IS NECESSARILY ONE OF

03:04:01.930 --> 03:04:04.666
THESE BUT HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS

03:04:04.733 --> 03:04:06.034
AROUND THE STATE.

03:04:06.101 --> 03:04:08.137
ARE OFTEN CAPTIVE THE SMALL

03:04:08.203 --> 03:04:11.073
GROUP OF INCUMBENTS WHO HOLD ON

03:04:11.140 --> 03:04:12.741
TO THEIR POWER AND PASS.

03:04:12.808 --> 03:04:14.743
RULES AND SO FORTH IN THEIR

03:04:14.810 --> 03:04:16.478
FAVOR.

03:04:16.545 --> 03:04:18.614
AND THAT THESE ABUSIVE PRACTICES

03:04:18.680 --> 03:04:20.516
IT'S A CONTINUUM THAT STARTS

03:04:20.582 --> 03:04:22.451
WITH THE WRITING OF THE RULES

03:04:22.518 --> 03:04:24.153
FOR HOW YOU RUN AN ELECTION.

03:04:24.219 --> 03:04:25.487
AND IT CONTINUES TO THE

03:04:25.554 --> 03:04:27.656
IMPLEMENTATION THAT THE CONDUCT

03:04:27.723 --> 03:04:29.258
OF THE ELECTION.

03:04:29.324 --> 03:04:31.660
AND WE HEARD OF SUCH PRACTICES

03:04:31.727 --> 03:04:34.563
AS WRITING.

03:04:34.630 --> 03:04:37.132
OF QUALIFICATIONS THAT EXCLUDE

03:04:37.199 --> 03:04:39.435
PEOPLE WHO WERE IN OPPOSITION

03:04:39.501 --> 03:04:40.469
AND ARE TRYING TO GET ON THE

03:04:40.536 --> 03:04:40.936
BOARD.

03:04:41.003 --> 03:04:43.439
AND TARA THE TARGET THOSE PEOPLE

03:04:43.505 --> 03:04:45.641
AND PREVENT THEM FROM RUNNING SO

03:04:45.707 --> 03:04:47.409
IN THE FACE OF THAT IT'S IRONIC

03:04:47.476 --> 03:04:48.811
TO HEAR THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH.

03:04:48.877 --> 03:04:50.679
CANDIDATES IN SOME OF THESE

03:04:50.746 --> 03:04:52.581
ORGANIZATIONS.

03:04:52.648 --> 03:04:54.583
OF THESE PRACTICES ARE DONE

03:04:54.650 --> 03:04:56.718
UNDER THE RADAR SO THAT THE

03:04:56.785 --> 03:04:59.188
MEMBERSHIP IS NOT OFTEN NOT

03:04:59.254 --> 03:05:01.557
AWARE OF WHAT IS GOING ON AND SO

03:05:01.623 --> 03:05:03.892
THIS BILL WHICH WOULD ALLOW

03:05:03.959 --> 03:05:05.727
SEATING BY ACCLAMATION.

03:05:05.794 --> 03:05:07.896
IT CONTINUES TO OR ALLOWS THIS

03:05:07.963 --> 03:05:09.698
CONTINUUM OF ABUSE TO CONTINUE

03:05:09.765 --> 03:05:12.835
AND IN FACT MAKES IT WORSE.

03:05:12.901 --> 03:05:15.337
THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL NOTES

03:05:15.404 --> 03:05:16.104
THAT.

03:05:16.171 --> 03:05:18.240
ONCE THE INSPECTOR OF ELECTIONS

03:05:18.307 --> 03:05:19.842
DETERMINES THAT.

03:05:19.908 --> 03:05:22.077
THE NUMBER OF NOMINEES IS NOT

03:05:22.144 --> 03:05:24.379
MORE THAN NUMBER OF VACANCIES.

03:05:24.446 --> 03:05:27.049
THE EXACT LANGUAGES.

03:05:27.115 --> 03:05:29.184
THE DIRECTOR NOMINEES SHALL BE

03:05:29.251 --> 03:05:30.786
CONSIDERED ELECTED BY

03:05:30.853 --> 03:05:33.255
ACCLAMATION IF THE ASSOCIATION

03:05:33.322 --> 03:05:36.325
FOLLOW THE PROCEDURE THE NOTICES.

03:05:36.391 --> 03:05:38.293
THERE'S NOT EVEN ANY INDICATION

03:05:38.360 --> 03:05:39.628
THAT THE BOARD HAS TO TAKE AN

03:05:39.695 --> 03:05:42.531
ACTION IT JUST HAPPENS AND AGAIN.

03:05:42.598 --> 03:05:44.299
UNDER THE RADAR SO THAT'S WHAT

03:05:44.366 --> 03:05:46.935
CAUSES US SUCH SO MUCH CONCERNED.

03:05:47.002 --> 03:05:50.272
ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL.

03:05:50.339 --> 03:05:53.041
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF ARGUMENTS

03:05:53.108 --> 03:05:55.744
PUT FORTH IN FAVOR OF THE BILL.

03:05:55.811 --> 03:05:58.747
OF ONE OF THESE IS THE LOGIC OF

03:05:58.814 --> 03:06:00.182
WHY HOLD ELECTION IF THERE

03:06:00.249 --> 03:06:02.050
AREN'T ENOUGH CANDIDATES WHO IS

03:06:02.117 --> 03:06:05.053
EQUAL CANDIDATES HIS VACANCIES.

03:06:05.120 --> 03:06:06.655
AND THAT LOGIC IS.

03:06:06.722 --> 03:06:08.490
I'VE ADDRESS THAT IN.

03:06:08.557 --> 03:06:10.826
SHOWING THAT THIS WOULD BE ONE

03:06:10.893 --> 03:06:13.328
OF THE CONTINUE.

03:06:13.395 --> 03:06:16.632
THE OTHER ANOTHER -- ARGUMENT IS

03:06:16.698 --> 03:06:18.634
THE COST.

03:06:18.700 --> 03:06:19.668
NOW BEGINNING WITH THE VERY

03:06:19.735 --> 03:06:21.837
FIRST BILL THAT WAS INTRODUCED I

03:06:21.904 --> 03:06:23.639
THINK FOUR YEARS AGO

03:06:23.705 --> 03:06:23.939
[inaudible]

03:06:24.006 --> 03:06:26.341
THE COST.

03:06:26.408 --> 03:06:28.343
PENCILS OUT TO ABOUT A DOLLAR

03:06:28.410 --> 03:06:29.878
PER MEMBER.

03:06:29.945 --> 03:06:32.247
PER ROOM PER A ELECTION.

03:06:32.314 --> 03:06:35.117
AND THOSE NUMBERS ARE CONFIRMED

03:06:35.183 --> 03:06:36.885
I MEAN WE HAD THE SAME BILL

03:06:36.952 --> 03:06:39.488
BEFORE YOU SAME SPONSOR LAST

03:06:39.555 --> 03:06:39.922
YEAR.

03:06:39.988 --> 03:06:41.890
AND THE FIGURES THAT ARE QUOTED

03:06:41.957 --> 03:06:46.194
IN THE ANALYSIS ARE ACOSTA SIXTY

03:06:46.261 --> 03:06:47.629
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I BELIEVE

03:06:47.696 --> 03:06:50.198
THAT WAS FOR THREE ELECTIONS IN

03:06:50.265 --> 03:06:52.067
ONE PARTICULAR CYCLE.

03:06:52.134 --> 03:06:54.303
AND WITH THE MEMBERSHIP OF

03:06:54.369 --> 03:06:54.903
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED

03:06:54.970 --> 03:06:56.872
THAT CANCELS OUT TO A DOLLAR

03:06:56.939 --> 03:06:59.074
EIGHTY PER MEMBER. TO MAINTAIN

03:06:59.141 --> 03:07:01.043
DEMOCRACY I DON'T THINK THAT

03:07:01.109 --> 03:07:02.144
THAT'S TOO MUCH OF A PRICE TO

03:07:02.210 --> 03:07:06.748
PAY -- THE OTHER IMPORTANT

03:07:06.815 --> 03:07:08.584
DISTINCTION IS IN THE PUBLIC

03:07:08.650 --> 03:07:10.485
ELECTIONS [inaudible]

03:07:10.552 --> 03:07:12.321
ARENA.

03:07:12.387 --> 03:07:14.156
THE RULES ARE NOT WRITTEN BY THE

03:07:14.222 --> 03:07:15.557
BOARD THAT'S BEING ELECTED OR

03:07:15.624 --> 03:07:17.893
THE CITY COUNCIL NOR IS IT.

03:07:17.960 --> 03:07:20.028

03:07:20.095 --> 03:07:22.364
THOSE PEOPLE BUT IN THIS CONTEXT

03:07:22.431 --> 03:07:23.932
IT IS AND SO THAT'S WHY WE THINK

03:07:23.999 --> 03:07:26.468
THIS BILL -- IS.

03:07:26.535 --> 03:07:28.170
A DANGEROUS ONE AND WE URGE YOU

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

03:07:45.587 --> 03:07:47.055

03:07:47.122 --> 03:07:50.759
ISSUE TO ME.

03:07:50.826 --> 03:07:52.361
I GUESS MY QUESTION TO THE

LAST YEAR THAT.

03:07:57.232 --> 03:07:59.501
VERSIONS OF THIS BILL BEFORE I

03:07:59.568 --> 03:08:01.169
GOT INVOLVED IN IT.

03:08:01.236 --> 03:08:04.373
INCLUDED PROVISIONS THAT THE

03:08:04.439 --> 03:08:05.540
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION WAS

03:08:05.607 --> 03:08:06.842
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE NOTICE TO

03:08:06.908 --> 03:08:08.410
ALL MEMBERS AT LEAST TWENTY DAYS

03:08:08.477 --> 03:08:09.678
BEFORE DECLARING ELECTION

03:08:09.745 --> 03:08:10.946
UNCONTESTED.

03:08:11.013 --> 03:08:12.981
IN OTHER WORDS HEY HOMEOWNERS

03:08:13.048 --> 03:08:14.950
WE'VE GOT FIVE CANDIDATES FOR

03:08:15.017 --> 03:08:16.084
FIVE VACANCIES.

03:08:16.151 --> 03:08:17.619
WE'RE GOING TO DECLARE THIS

03:08:17.686 --> 03:08:20.555
UNCONTESTED.

03:08:20.622 --> 03:08:22.924
AND THAT DIDN'T APPEAR TO

03:08:22.991 --> 03:08:25.794
SATISFY THE OPPONENTS TO THAT

03:08:25.861 --> 03:08:27.596
PARTICULAR BILL BY.

03:08:27.663 --> 03:08:29.264
ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAY IS.

03:08:29.331 --> 03:08:32.668
IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SO MY QUESTION

03:08:32.734 --> 03:08:34.102
IS THIS IS THERE ANYTHING.

03:08:34.169 --> 03:08:35.237
THAT WOULD REMOVE YOUR

03:08:35.303 --> 03:08:39.207
OPPOSITION. TO AN ELECTION BY

03:08:39.274 --> 03:08:41.176
ACCLAMATION.

03:08:41.243 --> 03:08:43.345
WHEN THE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES

03:08:43.412 --> 03:08:47.683
EQUALS THE NUMBER OF VACANCIES?

03:08:47.749 --> 03:08:51.153
THAT WAS ACTUALLY OUR AMENDMENT.

03:08:51.219 --> 03:08:52.821
WHAT THE ANALYSIS SAID IT DID

03:08:52.888 --> 03:08:53.655
NOT SATISFY THE?

03:08:53.722 --> 03:08:57.092
OPPOSE OPPOSITION CONCERNED SO

03:08:57.159 --> 03:08:58.126
NO TO THE MAYES BILL I'M TALKING

03:08:58.193 --> 03:08:59.161
ABOUT.

03:08:59.227 --> 03:09:00.629
THAT WAS OUR MEN WITH THAT WHAT

03:09:00.696 --> 03:09:01.196
THE AND CAUSE INCREASE I'M

03:09:01.263 --> 03:09:02.531
READING THE ANALYSIS THAT

03:09:02.597 --> 03:09:03.799
PROVISION HOWEVER DID NOT

03:09:03.865 --> 03:09:06.234
SATISFY OPPOSITION CONCERNS.

03:09:06.301 --> 03:09:08.203
MAYBE YOU WERE THE OPPOSITION

03:09:08.270 --> 03:09:09.871
HAS SENATOR WIENER DO YOU WANT

03:09:09.938 --> 03:09:12.040
ME TO ANSWER THAT OR DOES YOUR

03:09:12.107 --> 03:09:13.608
QUESTION -- WELL WHAT THAT

03:09:13.675 --> 03:09:18.146
RAISES SENATOR ROTH IS THE

03:09:18.213 --> 03:09:19.715
BROADER.

03:09:19.781 --> 03:09:21.817
IS THE INHERENT DEFECT.

03:09:21.883 --> 03:09:24.286
OF ACCLAMATION WHICH IS.

03:09:24.352 --> 03:09:26.621
THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

03:09:26.688 --> 03:09:30.525
MEMBERSHIP. TO OBJECT.

03:09:30.592 --> 03:09:32.094
AND EVEN IN THE FOR TALKING

03:09:32.160 --> 03:09:33.829
ABOUT A SCHOOL BOARD ELECTION

03:09:33.895 --> 03:09:35.497
AND THIS IS IN THE ANALYSIS.

03:09:35.564 --> 03:09:38.934
THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY.

03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:40.602
FOR VOTERS WHO LIVE IN IN A

03:09:40.669 --> 03:09:43.638
SCHOOL BOARD DISTRICT. TO GET UP

03:09:43.705 --> 03:09:46.174
A PETITION UP AT A CERTAIN LEVEL

03:09:46.241 --> 03:09:47.776
AND DEMAND THAT THE ELECTION BE

03:09:47.843 --> 03:09:49.144
HELD.

03:09:49.211 --> 03:09:50.946
AND THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY FOR

03:09:51.012 --> 03:09:51.780
THAT.

03:09:51.847 --> 03:09:54.182
THERE HAS BEEN NO OPPORTUNITY

03:09:54.249 --> 03:09:56.184
FOR THAT THEY MANY VERSIONS.

03:09:56.251 --> 03:09:58.019
OF THIS OF THE ACCLAMATION BILLS

03:09:58.086 --> 03:09:59.654
WITHIN LET ME RE AS MY QUESTION

03:09:59.721 --> 03:10:00.922
BECAUSE THIS OF COURSE IS THE

03:10:00.989 --> 03:10:02.324
SACRAMENTO WAY AND WE SEE IT ALL

03:10:02.390 --> 03:10:03.725
THE TIME.

03:10:03.792 --> 03:10:05.360
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT COULD BE

03:10:05.427 --> 03:10:07.662
DONE TO THIS BILL. TO ALLOW

03:10:07.729 --> 03:10:08.864
ACCLAMATION.

03:10:08.930 --> 03:10:10.432
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHERE THE

03:10:10.499 --> 03:10:12.134
NUMBER OF CANDIDATES EQUALS THE

03:10:12.200 --> 03:10:13.568
NUMBER OF VACANCIES I DON'T

03:10:13.635 --> 03:10:16.004
THINK SO BECAUSE IT REMOVES THE

03:10:16.071 --> 03:10:17.572
RIGHT TO VOTE FROM THE

03:10:17.639 --> 03:10:19.074
MEMBERSHIP.

03:10:19.141 --> 03:10:21.710
WHICH IS THE INHERENT DEFECT OF

03:10:21.777 --> 03:10:24.346
THIS APPROACH BUT ISN'T VOTING.

03:10:24.412 --> 03:10:25.814
IN AN ELECTION WHERE THE NUMBER

03:10:25.881 --> 03:10:27.449
OF CANDIDATES EQUALS NUMBER OF

03:10:27.516 --> 03:10:29.985
VACANCIES.

03:10:30.051 --> 03:10:31.620
AN IDLE ACT [inaudible]

03:10:31.686 --> 03:10:34.723
SO. TO EXPLAIN TO ME HOW THE

03:10:34.790 --> 03:10:35.924
VOTING WORKS IS IS THERE

03:10:35.991 --> 03:10:37.425
ANYTHING WATER THE OP WHAT ARE

03:10:37.492 --> 03:10:39.327
THE OPTIONS.

03:10:39.394 --> 03:10:40.962
AT THAT POINT FOR A VOTER IN A

03:10:41.029 --> 03:10:42.631
HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION WHERE THE

03:10:42.697 --> 03:10:43.865
NUMBER.

03:10:43.932 --> 03:10:45.700
OF CANDIDATES EQUALS THE NUMBER

03:10:45.767 --> 03:10:48.069
OF VACANCIES IT'S NOT JUST

03:10:48.136 --> 03:10:49.838
NUMBER OF CANDIDATES EQUALS

03:10:49.905 --> 03:10:51.506
NUMBER OF VACANCIES IT'S THE

03:10:51.573 --> 03:10:54.242
TOTALITY OF THIS APPROACH WHERE

03:10:54.309 --> 03:10:56.678
YOU HAVE WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE.

03:10:56.745 --> 03:10:58.847
LAID OUT IN OUR LETTER AND WHICH

03:10:58.914 --> 03:11:00.949
I THINK -- HERREN HAS LAID OUT

03:11:01.016 --> 03:11:05.587
IN THE ANALYSIS WHERE YOU HAVE.

03:11:05.654 --> 03:11:08.824
THE INCUMBENTS ESTABLISHING THE

03:11:08.890 --> 03:11:10.025
QUALIFICATIONS.

03:11:10.091 --> 03:11:13.728
WHERE YOU HAVE THE INSPECTOR

03:11:13.795 --> 03:11:15.597
DETERMINING THAT?

03:11:15.664 --> 03:11:18.200
THESE PEOPLE ARE QUALIFIED

03:11:18.266 --> 03:11:18.500
[inaudible]

03:11:18.567 --> 03:11:21.336
AND THE INCUMBENTS ARE ALSO

03:11:21.403 --> 03:11:23.805
IMPLEMENTING AN EXIT CHOOSING

03:11:23.872 --> 03:11:24.573
THE INSPECTOR.

03:11:24.639 --> 03:11:27.475
AND IMPLEMENTING THE ELECTION SO

03:11:27.542 --> 03:11:29.678
IT'S NOT JUST A SIMPLE.

03:11:29.744 --> 03:11:32.647
WE'VE GOT FIVE WARM BODIES TO

03:11:32.714 --> 03:11:34.616
FILL FIVE VACANCIES.

03:11:34.683 --> 03:11:36.651
IT'S THE TOTALITY OF THIS

03:11:36.718 --> 03:11:38.019
PROCESS.

03:11:38.086 --> 03:11:41.156
SO IT'S NOT JUST ACCLAMATION

03:11:41.223 --> 03:11:43.158
IT'S THE WHOLE PACKAGE.

03:11:43.225 --> 03:11:44.192
THANK THANK YOU FOR YOUR

03:11:44.259 --> 03:11:48.096

03:11:55.170 --> 03:11:57.539
SOMETHING WE MOTION.

IN A ROTH OF THE BILL OKAY -- WE

03:12:00.675 --> 03:12:07.916
HAVE A MOTION -- AND THAT IS --

03:12:07.983 --> 03:12:10.986
JUDICIARY.

03:12:11.052 --> 03:12:12.554
OKAY FEDERAL UP WOULD LIKE TO

03:12:12.621 --> 03:12:15.257
CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

03:12:15.323 --> 03:12:16.591
I I GUESS.

03:12:16.658 --> 03:12:18.526
WE'RE LOOKING AT TWO WAYS TO

03:12:18.593 --> 03:12:19.728
LOOK AT A HOMEOWNERS BOARD OF

03:12:19.794 --> 03:12:21.897
DIRECTORS. ONE IS THAT THERE'S

03:12:21.963 --> 03:12:22.931
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEM AND

03:12:22.998 --> 03:12:24.099
THEY'RE TRYING DESPERATELY TO

03:12:24.165 --> 03:12:26.201
MAINTAIN CONTROL AND KEEP OTHERS

03:12:26.268 --> 03:12:27.202
OUT.

03:12:27.269 --> 03:12:28.703
AND THERE'S THE OTHER SIDE WHERE

03:12:28.770 --> 03:12:30.005
WE'RE JUST GLAD PEOPLE ARE

03:12:30.071 --> 03:12:31.539
RUNNING AND SPENDING AN EVENING

03:12:31.606 --> 03:12:32.841
A MONTH.

03:12:32.908 --> 03:12:34.676
TO MEET WITH THE BOARD LISTEN TO

03:12:34.743 --> 03:12:35.844
THE COMPLAINTS.

03:12:35.911 --> 03:12:37.379
I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF SERVING

03:12:37.445 --> 03:12:39.281
ON A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION

03:12:39.347 --> 03:12:42.751
BOARD ONE OF THE SEMINARS I WENT.

03:12:42.817 --> 03:12:44.719
TO TOLD ME THAT -- MOST BOARD

03:12:44.786 --> 03:12:46.321
PRESIDENT TO MOVE OUT WITHIN A

03:12:46.388 --> 03:12:48.690
YEAR OR TWO AFTER THEY'VE SERVED

03:12:48.757 --> 03:12:50.191
BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD ENOUGH OF

03:12:50.258 --> 03:12:51.259
PEOPLE CALL IN THE MIDDLE MIGHT

03:12:51.326 --> 03:12:53.061
SAY IN A MY NEWSPAPERS WET OR

03:12:53.128 --> 03:12:54.162
THIS OR THAT.

03:12:54.229 --> 03:12:56.298
SO -- IT'S IS BUT AS LOCAL AS IT

03:12:56.364 --> 03:12:58.600
GETS AND IS AS FRUSTRATING AS IT

03:12:58.667 --> 03:12:59.100
IS.

03:12:59.167 --> 03:13:03.772
AND SO I'M I'M BUT IN THE SCHOOL.

03:13:03.838 --> 03:13:04.506
AND I'M EXCITED TO HAVE PEOPLE

03:13:04.572 --> 03:13:05.640
WILLING TO RUN AND IF I HAD MORE

03:13:05.707 --> 03:13:07.242
CANDIDATES THAN POSITIONS THAT'S

03:13:07.309 --> 03:13:09.544
REALLY GREAT NEWS -- BUT IF YOU

03:13:09.611 --> 03:13:11.313
HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF

03:13:11.379 --> 03:13:13.415
CANDIDATES OR LESS.

03:13:13.481 --> 03:13:15.617
THEN WHY ARE WE SPENDING THE

03:13:15.684 --> 03:13:18.920
TIME AND EFFORT -- YOU KNOW I I

03:13:18.987 --> 03:13:21.056
HEAR THE ARGUMENTS.

03:13:21.122 --> 03:13:22.190
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE FACT

03:13:22.257 --> 03:13:23.258
THAT THERE'S A SINGLE PLAY

03:13:23.325 --> 03:13:25.026
PLEASE GET PEOPLE TO RUN.

03:13:25.093 --> 03:13:27.362
OR MAYBE MAYBE PUT UP THE MONEY

03:13:27.429 --> 03:13:30.031
TO PAY FOR THE FOR THE MAILING

03:13:30.098 --> 03:13:31.967
IF YOU HAVE THE TWENTY THOUSAND

03:13:32.033 --> 03:13:34.636
OR OR MAYBE MAYBE WE HAD A STEP

03:13:34.703 --> 03:13:35.103
BACK AND SAY OKAY FOR

03:13:35.170 --> 03:13:36.071
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE.

03:13:36.137 --> 03:13:38.506
SERVING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

03:13:38.573 --> 03:13:39.140
FIFTY FIVE AN OLDER LIKE LAGUNA

03:13:39.207 --> 03:13:41.109
WOODS MAYBE THEY SHOULD BE

03:13:41.176 --> 03:13:42.477
EXEMPTED.

03:13:42.544 --> 03:13:44.179
BUT FOR CRYING ABOUT I GUESS I

03:13:44.245 --> 03:13:45.046
WOULD SAY.

03:13:45.113 --> 03:13:46.815
YOU KNOW HOMEOWNERS YOU'RE

03:13:46.881 --> 03:13:48.249
ADULTS NO THE FILING PERIOD NO

03:13:48.316 --> 03:13:51.553
THE RULES AND AND VIOLENT TIME.

03:13:51.619 --> 03:13:53.221
OF WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF

03:13:53.288 --> 03:13:54.789
CRITICAL DATES IN OUR LIVES LIKE

03:13:54.856 --> 03:13:57.292
APRIL FIFTEENTH APRIL FIFTEEN

03:13:57.359 --> 03:13:59.527
APRIL TEN APRIL SEPT A DECEMBER

DO OUR THING OR WE HAVE

03:14:04.766 --> 03:14:05.734
PENALTIES.

03:14:05.800 --> 03:14:06.868
SO I I SEE NOTHING HERE THAT'S

03:14:06.935 --> 03:14:07.869
UNDER THE RADAR.

03:14:07.936 --> 03:14:08.770

03:18:38.072 --> 03:18:39.374
PROBLEM OF WORK.

IN FACT MOTHERS WITH YOUNG

03:18:52.487 --> 03:18:54.255
CHILDREN ARE THE FASTEST GROWING

03:18:54.322 --> 03:18:56.224

WANT TO BRED BREAST FEED.

03:18:58.793 --> 03:19:01.229
IN CALIFORNIA 94% OF NEW PARENTS

03:19:01.296 --> 03:19:01.896
START OFF BREAST FEEDING IN THE

03:19:01.963 --> 03:19:03.731

RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT

03:19:17.145 --> 03:19:19.180
LACTATION SUPPORT LEADS TO FEWER

03:19:19.247 --> 03:19:21.949
SIXTIES INCREASES MORALE --

CENTER ON IN SACRAMENTO AND ONE

03:19:52.046 --> 03:19:52.980
OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID WAS WE

03:19:58.720 --> 03:20:01.222
OF A LAW THAT WE CREATED SO WE

CAMPUS AND OF THE HEALTH CENTER

03:20:11.432 --> 03:20:13.568
AND ONE OF THE THE THINGS THAT

03:20:13.634 --> 03:20:15.336
WE HAVE IS A BUILDING CODE.

03:20:15.403 --> 03:20:17.572
THAT REQUIRES THAT NUMBER ONE IF

03:20:17.638 --> 03:20:18.806
WE BUILD A NEW BUILDING THAT

03:20:18.873 --> 03:20:20.641

IT'S A GOOD ONE AND WE FEEL THAT

03:20:33.621 --> 03:20:35.523

WE SUPPORT AS MANY WOMEN AS

ON THAT BILL AS WELL AS CHANGING --

03:24:09.337 --> 03:24:10.705
FOR A PROVISIONS OF THAT BILL

03:24:10.771 --> 03:24:12.239
THAT WERE NEGOTIATED I DO

03:24:12.306 --> 03:24:13.841
UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMITTEE

03:24:13.908 --> 03:24:16.010
HAS RECOMMENDED SOME PROPOSALS

03:24:16.077 --> 03:24:16.877
FOR AMENDING.

03:24:16.944 --> 03:24:18.179
THEBUILDING CODE PROVISION

03:24:18.245 --> 03:24:19.580
UNFORTUNATELY THE INDIVIDUAL

03:24:19.647 --> 03:24:20.581
FROM THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS

03:24:20.648 --> 03:24:22.116
PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION IS UNABLE

03:24:22.183 --> 03:24:23.718
TO BE HERE THIS EVENING DUE TO

03:24:23.784 --> 03:24:25.653
AN UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCE --

03:24:25.720 --> 03:24:27.989
BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

03:24:28.055 --> 03:24:29.357
THAT THAT AMENDMENTS WERE NOT

03:24:29.423 --> 03:24:30.524
GOING TO ADDRESS THOSE OVERALL

03:24:30.591 --> 03:24:32.193
CONCERNS I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT

03:24:32.259 --> 03:24:33.594
LAST YEAR WHEN THE BILL MADE IT

03:24:33.661 --> 03:24:35.062
TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK ALL OF

03:24:35.129 --> 03:24:35.997
THE BUILDING CODE PROVISIONS

03:24:36.063 --> 03:24:37.365
WERE ACTUALLY AMENDED OUT OF

03:24:37.431 --> 03:24:38.165
THIS BILL.

03:24:38.232 --> 03:24:39.233
AND THAT'S OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING

03:24:39.300 --> 03:24:40.568
THAT WE WOULD RECOMMEND IN THIS

03:24:40.635 --> 03:24:42.336
CIRCUMSTANCE -- AND ADDITIONALLY

03:24:42.403 --> 03:24:43.904
OVERALL THERE'S LEGITIMATE

03:24:43.971 --> 03:24:45.673
CONCERNS WITH THE LABOR CODE

03:24:45.740 --> 03:24:46.974
PROVISIONS THAT ARE ADDED OR

03:24:47.041 --> 03:24:48.776
THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THIS BILL --

03:24:48.843 --> 03:24:50.544
BECAUSE RETALIATION FOR

03:24:50.611 --> 03:24:51.779
LACTATION ACCOMMODATION IS

03:24:51.846 --> 03:24:52.980
ALREADY A PART OF THE GOVERNMENT

03:24:53.047 --> 03:24:54.215
CODE THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR

03:24:54.281 --> 03:24:56.717
EMPLOYMENT HOUSING OVERSEAS LIKE --

03:24:56.784 --> 03:24:58.252
TO OVERSEAS DISCRIMINATION AND

03:24:58.319 --> 03:25:00.221
RETALIATION BASED ON SEX --

03:25:00.287 --> 03:25:02.690
ADDITIONALLY THERE ARE THE TWO

03:25:02.757 --> 03:25:04.592
TWO SIX WADE VIOLATIONS WHICH

03:25:04.659 --> 03:25:06.460
ALLOW FOR ESSENTIALLY DOUBLE

03:25:06.527 --> 03:25:07.795
PENALTIES I WHICH MEANS THAT

03:25:07.862 --> 03:25:09.163
EMPLOYERS WOULD BE MORE INCLINED

03:25:09.230 --> 03:25:10.865
IN THE SITUATION TO TRY AND

03:25:10.931 --> 03:25:12.400
REGULATE THE REST BREAKS THAT

03:25:12.466 --> 03:25:13.501
EMPLOYEES TAKE.

03:25:13.567 --> 03:25:15.136
WITH REGARD TO LACTATION AND I

03:25:15.202 --> 03:25:16.303
DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S ANYTHING

03:25:16.370 --> 03:25:17.672
THAT ANYBODY REALLY WANTS IS THE

03:25:17.738 --> 03:25:19.573
EMPLOYER GETTING TOO INVOLVED IN

03:25:19.640 --> 03:25:20.574
ONE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS TO LACTATE.

03:25:20.641 --> 03:25:22.076
I'M FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE

03:25:22.143 --> 03:25:23.077
CURRENTLY OPPOSED TO THE BILL WE

COMMITTEE WE DON'T HAVE ANY

03:25:48.669 --> 03:25:51.205
CONCERNS WITH THE PROPONENTS OF

03:25:51.272 --> 03:25:53.140

NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX LAST YEAR

03:25:57.945 --> 03:25:59.847
OUR CONCERN IS THE IMPACT ON

03:25:59.914 --> 03:26:00.881
BUSINESS.

03:26:00.948 --> 03:26:02.550
SENATOR WIENER DID DROP THE

03:26:02.616 --> 03:26:04.185
PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION THERE

03:26:04.251 --> 03:26:05.653
WAS IN THE BILL BUT BECAUSE OF

03:26:05.720 --> 03:26:06.420
THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE

03:26:06.487 --> 03:26:07.755
REFERENCED BY MISS CURTIS OF THE

03:26:07.822 --> 03:26:08.789
LABOR CODE.

03:26:08.856 --> 03:26:10.424
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THESE ARE

03:26:10.491 --> 03:26:12.293
SUBJECT THEN TO A REPRESENTATIVE

03:26:12.359 --> 03:26:13.694
ACTION UNDER THE PRIVATE

03:26:13.761 --> 03:26:16.030
ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT PAGA WHICH

03:26:16.097 --> 03:26:17.732
GIVES US GRAVE CONCERN.

03:26:17.798 --> 03:26:19.100
THE OTHER ROVISION IS WE'D LIKE

03:26:19.166 --> 03:26:23.604
TO SEE AN EXPANSION OF THE WELL

03:26:23.671 --> 03:26:24.872
THE HARDSHIP EXEMPTION IS

03:26:24.939 --> 03:26:26.407
CONTAINED IN THE LAW TODAY IT'S

03:26:26.474 --> 03:26:27.308
VERY LIMITED.

03:26:27.374 --> 03:26:28.576
IN THE LAST POINT I WOULD MAKE

03:26:28.642 --> 03:26:30.377
IS THAT THIS MEASURE IS BASED

03:26:30.444 --> 03:26:31.879
UPON A SAN FRANCISCO ORDINANCE

03:26:31.946 --> 03:26:33.681
THAT IS LESS THAN A YEAR AND A

03:26:33.748 --> 03:26:34.949
HALF OLD AND WE THINK IT'S A

03:26:35.015 --> 03:26:36.650
LITTLE PREMATURE TO TAKE THIS

03:26:36.717 --> 03:26:39.186
MEASURE.

03:26:50.197 --> 03:26:51.065
TO THE BILL.

03:26:51.132 --> 03:26:53.300
ON MANY OF THE REASONS OF FOR

03:26:53.367 --> 03:26:54.335
MANY OF THE REASONS THAT WERE

03:26:54.401 --> 03:26:56.237
PREVIOUSLY STATED BUT I ALSO

03:26:56.303 --> 03:26:58.105
WANTED TO JUST -- EXPAND A

03:26:58.172 --> 03:27:00.307
LITTLE BIT ON THE HARDSHIP ISSUE

03:27:00.374 --> 03:27:02.276
WHICH IS CONCERNING FOR US WE

03:27:02.343 --> 03:27:04.745
WERE ON THE LOW MOAN BILL LAST

03:27:04.812 --> 03:27:06.914
YEAR I NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT I

03:27:06.981 --> 03:27:07.248
THINK IT WAS.

03:27:07.314 --> 03:27:10.351
AND WE WERE ABLE TO WORK OUT --

03:27:10.417 --> 03:27:12.386
A PROVISION RELATED TO HARDSHIP

03:27:12.453 --> 03:27:13.954
THAT HELPED US TO REMOVE OUR

03:27:14.021 --> 03:27:15.456
OPPOSITION THE HARDSHIP

03:27:15.523 --> 03:27:17.224
PROVISION IN THIS BILL IS

03:27:17.291 --> 03:27:18.325
RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF

EMPLOYEES AT A COMPANY HAS.

03:27:20.961 --> 03:27:23.164
AND THE COUNT OF EMPLOYEES

03:27:23.230 --> 03:27:24.832
REALLY ISN'T THE ISSUE

03:27:24.899 --> 03:27:26.467
ESPECIALLY FOR THE MANUFACTURING.

03:27:26.534 --> 03:27:27.902
INDUSTRY IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE

03:27:27.968 --> 03:27:29.870
NATURE OF THE FACILITY IF THE

03:27:29.937 --> 03:27:31.839
FACILITY IS SUCH THAT WE CAN'T

03:27:31.906 --> 03:27:34.642
PROVIDE A SAFE PLACE FOR MOTHER

03:27:34.708 --> 03:27:36.043
