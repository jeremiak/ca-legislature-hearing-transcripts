THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT AB TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED BEFORE YOU TODAY I WANT TO START BY THANKING OUR CHAIR FOR THE INCREDIBLE MENTAL WORK IN TIME ENERGY. SHE'S PUT IN OB TO LISTENING. PUT TO DISCUSSING THE ISSUE. AND FOR ALLOWING THE SPACE FOR US TO GET WHERE WE ARE TODAY. I CERTAINLY WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF UP PUTTING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK AND INTO. THE INTO THE UP TODAY AND TO COME TO THIS MOMENT AS WELL AS REPUBLICAN. AKAKA STAFF AS WELL THOUGH I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LOT OF TIME IN DISCUSSING THE MATTER WITH MY STAFF. A I KNOW IT HAS BEEN EASY AND ONE EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL. I AND I WANT TO THANK MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR TIME AND FEEDBACK IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY VALUABLE. TO HEAR FROM NOT JUST THE CHAIR BUT FROM ALL COMMITTEE MEMBERS. BOB THE OF BEFORE GETTING TO THE SERB TO THIS HEARING. IN RESPONSE TO THE TO THIS FEEDBACK AND YOUR TIME I'LL COMMIT. UP AT THIS TIME TO REMOVING THE RATE CAP OF LOANS BETWEEN FIVE AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS LOOK AT OTHER WAYS WE CAN WORK TO HELP PROTECT BARS. IN THIS LOAN RANGE. THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO THIS LEGISLATURE IN AN EFFORT. TO BRING DOWN INTEREST RATES FOR INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER LOANS PASS EXCESSIVE MEASURES TO ELIMINATE THE INTEREST RATE CAPS FOR LOANS. OF BETWEEN TEN AND BY THOUSAND AND THEN AGAIN FOR LOANS BETWEEN FIVE AND TWENTY FOUR BY THOUSAND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. THE DOCUMENT ARGUMENT AT THE TIME WAS THAT ELIMINATING THE RATE CAP ALLOW BASE TO BE SEC COMPETITIVELY IN THE MARKETPLACE. THUS BY INCREASING COMPETITION IT WOULD LOWER RATES HOWEVER ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SEEN COMPETITION INCREASE OF THE LAST TWO DECADES. WE HAVE NOT SEEN A DECREASE IN RATES RATHER WE HAVE WATCHED RATE SKYROCKET WHERE MANY LENDERS NOW ISSUE LOANS INTEREST RATES ANYWHERE FROM ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. TO AS HIGH AS THREE HUNDRED PERCENT. IN FACT ACCORDING TO THE CALVET DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT NEARLY SIXTY PERCENT. INSTALLMENT LOANS A TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS HAD APRS OF A HUNDRED PERCENT OR HIGHER. THESE ARE UNCONSCIONABLE INTEREST RATES THAT PLACE SERIOUS AND DEBILITATING IMPACTS ON ECONOMIC SECURITY AND CREDIT OF LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. DEFAULT RATES ARE CALMLY AS HIGH AS FORTY PERCENT AS TO WHETHER EVERY FIVE LOANS. THIS IS NOT ACCESS TO CREDIT THIS IS ACCESS TO UNMANAGEABLE DEBT AND DESTROYED. POTENTIAL FOR CREDIT. THIS IS WHY I'M BOTHERING AB TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. AB TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED REINSTATE THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK UNDER THE CALIFORNIA FINANCING LAW. TO WHICH APPLIED OF HIGH DOLLAR CONSUMER LOANS TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. BASICALLY IT WOULD ESTABLISH A. THIRTY SIX PERCENT RATE CAP PROLONGS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A THIRTY SIX PERCENT. AND PUT IN PLACE NEW CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FOR THESE LOANS. SUCH AS MS MALONE TERMS AND INCREASE ACCESS TO FINANCIAL LITERACY COUNSELING SERVICES. THIS MEASURE ALSO ALLOWS EFFORTS THAT HAVE PURSUED NOT JUST ANOTHER STATES BUT NATIONALLY. CURRENTLY TWENTY ONE OTHER STATES HAVE SIMILAR RATE CAPS FOR CONSUMER LENDING OF THIS KIND MANY WITH A THIRTY SIX PERCENT RATE CAP. EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANTLY IT TWO THOUSAND SIX THE U. S. CONGRESS PASSED THE MILITARY LENDING ACT RESPONSE TO THIS VERY ISSUE. UNDER THE MLA IN ADDITION TO MANY OTHER SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IT PROHIBITS ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS FROM BEING CHARGED AN INTEREST RATE HIGHER THAN THIRTY SIX PERCENT. THAT APPLIES NOT JUST TO INSTALLMENT LOANS AND OTHER TITLE IT ALSO APPLIES. IT ALSO APPLIED ALL PAYDAY LOANS DEPOSITED BANDS LOANS UNSECURED OPEN AND LINES OF CREDIT AND CREDIT CARDS. IN OUR CASE BY REINSTITUTING A RATE STRUCTURE FOR THESE. HIGH DOLLAR LOANS SIMILAR TO OTHER STATES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED. WE CAN BEGIN TO TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS OF IMPLEMENTING SOUND FINANCE PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS WHO NEED ALONE WHEN BASIS STRESSFUL FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCE. WE ABSOLUTELY WANT TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO CREDIT. WE MUST DO IN A WAY THAT'S RESPONSIBLE I THAT ACTUALLY HELPS TO LIFT CALIFORNIA FAMILIES OUT OF POVERTY. NOT HOW THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL OF FURTHER INTO POVERTY. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS MAKE YOU MAY HAVE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BOAT AND WE DO AS THE CHAIRED INDICATED HYPED. UP BUT WITNESSES THAT WILL BE SPEAKING UP FOR THE NEXT EIGHT MINUTES ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU AND AT WE DO YOU HAVE QUORUM SO AS. THIS SUPPORTERS I COME FORWARD AND LIKE TO ASK A HOME OUR SECRETARY TO PLEASE. CALL THE ROLL. LEóN. CHEN. ACOSTA. HERE PLASTIC HERE. BURKE. CALDERON. CALDERON HERE. CERVANTES. CHOI THEIR CHOI HERE. GONZALEZ FLETCHER. SOUTH FLETCHER HERE. GRAYSON. RECENT HERE STONE. WEBER. I THINK IF. ALRIGHT WE WILL HEAR FROM THOSE IN SUPPORT AND CARE AFTERNOON MY NAME. FOR YOU POLICY FOR THE CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING STERILE IS A NONPROFIT RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO PROTECTING HOMEOWNERSHIP IN FAMILY WEALTH BY FIGHTING PREDATORY LENDING PRACTICES. I MYSELF I SPENT TWO DECADES FIGHTING FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES GREW UP IN A LOW INCOME. FAMILY SINGLE MOM TRYING TO MAKE MAKE ENDS MEET AND LUCKILY I WASN'T. WE WANT A TARGET OF THESE PREDATORY LOANS BECAUSE THEY'RE OUTLAWED IN OUR STATE IN FACT FIFTEEN STATES PLUS TO TO DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA DO NOT ALLOW HIGH COST LOANS. ARE THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA SOUTH DAKOTA WAS THE LATEST STATE TO CAP A P. OURS AT THIRTY SIX pINITIATIVE IN THEIR THIRTY FOUR STATES I HAVE A THIRTY SIX PERCENT CAP ON LOANS OF TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. I'M SORRY YES OF TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIA HAS FALLEN BEHIND IN TWO THOUSAND SIX CONGRESS IMPLEMENTED A THIRTY SIX PERCENT RATE CAP ON PAYDAY LOANS FOR ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. CONGRESS TOOK THIS ACTION ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS AFTER THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE DETERMINE THAT PAYDAY LOANS WERE HARMING. OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM. AND TWENTY FIFTEEN OF THE EXPANDED THE RULES TO COVER LONGER TERM LOANS AND ENSURE THAT THE EPR CALCULATION INCLUDES ALL LOAN COSTS INCLUDING CREDIT INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND OTHER FEES. UP HERE CALIFORNIA THERE ARE MORE PAYDAY LENDING STORES THAN MCDONALD'S THESE ONE STOP SHOPS OFFER PAYDAY LOANS CAR TITLE LOANS AND HIGH COST INSTALLMENT LOANS THERE'S BEEN A HUGE SHIFT FROM PAYDAY. TO THE HIGHER COST LOANS IS WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OF THE IT THESE STORES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LOCATED IN LATINO AND AFRICAN AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOODS THIS IS ACCORDING TO WHAT TWENTY SIXTEEN DB ó REPORT THAT SHOWS UP EVEN WHEN ANNA FACTORING INCOME. AB TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED WILL PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM ABUSIVE HIGH COST LOANS OUR GOAL IS TO PROTECT THEM FROM THESE TRIPLE DIGIT AP ARE LOANS. AS MUCH AS WELL WANT TO SAFEGUARD ACCESS TO CREDIT FOR THESE LOANS THESE LOANS DESTROY CREDIT THE CREDIT SCORE A FOR OF FAMILIES AS THEY WANT TO GO BUY A NEW CAR BUY A NEW HOUSE. THEY WILL BE STUCK IN THE SUBPRIME LOANS BECAUSE OF WHAT THESE LOANS ARE DOING TO THEM. AND I'M GOING TO YIELD MY TIME TO THE NEXT SPEAKER. THANK YOU. CHAIRPERSON ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MY NAME IS JACOB DEMAND TESTIFYING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED ON BEHALF. THE SAN FRANCISCO OFFICE OF FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT PART OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO. THE OFFICE OF FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT LED BY TREASURE JOSE CISNEROS LEVERAGES THE POWER CITY HALL TO STRENGTHEN ECONOMIC SECURITY AND MOBILITY FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES. WE'VE LAUNCH PIONEERING PROGRAMS TO INCREASE FINANCIAL WELL BEING. AND THROUGH FINANCIAL COACHING AND OTHER INITIATIVES I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS THE PREDATORY LENDING CAN HAVE ON OUR RESIDENTS. MANY OTHER CITIES ACROSS THE STATE IN THE COUNTRY HAVE UNDERSTOOD EXPERIENCE THE HARMFUL IMPACT HIGH COST CONSUMER LOANS. TREASURER CRISIS NERIS COE CHAIRS THE CITY'S FOR FINANCIAL EMPOWERMENT COALITION. A GROUP OF FIFTEEN MEMBER CITIES REPRESENTING ALMOST TWENTY TWO MILLION PEOPLE INCLUDING SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES. OUR MEMBERS ARE UNITED IN CALLING FOR STRONGER CONSUMER LENDING PROTECTIONS. OUR OFFICE HAS WORKED FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS WITH LOCAL AND STATE LENDERS TO STATE LEADERS. EXCUSE ME TO COMBAT HARMFUL CONSUMER LOANS. FOR EXAMPLE BY ENACTING ITS OWN ZONING ORDINANCE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TO RESTRICT PAYDAY AND FRENCH FINANCIAL USE. AND BY WORKING WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE ON THEIR PILOT PROGRAM FOR SMALL DOLLAR LENDING. MANY OTHER CALIFORNIA CITIES HAVE TAKEN SIMILAR STEPS TO OPPOSE PAYDAY AND OTHER. INSTALLMENT LENDING HOWEVER THERE CRUCIAL LIMITS TO OUR LOCAL AUTHORITY AND WE NEED THE LEGISLATORS HAVE LEGISLATURE'S HELP. I WILL NOTE WITH THE A CURRENT ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORT TO DISMANTLE THE CFPB AND ROLLBACK CONSUMER PROTECTIONS NATIONALLY THAT IS EVEN MORE CRUCIAL. RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT ALL OF THE LARGEST PAYDAY LENDERS NOW OFFER INSTALLMENT LOANS IN ADDITION TO CONVENTIONAL PAYDAY LOANS AND THE SHIFT HAS BEEN WIDESPREAD WITH PAYDAY OR AUTO TITLE LENDERS. ISSUING SUCH LOANS ARE LINES OF CREDIT IN TWENTY SIX OF THE THIRTY NINE STATES WHERE THEY OPERATE. WE'RE ASKING THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO STEP UP. AND IMPOSE MUCH NEEDED INTEREST RATE CAPS AND CONSUMER PROTECTIONS SO THAT OUR RESIDENTS CAN AVOID THE POISON PILL OF HIGH COST INSTALLMENT LOANS. RESULTING IN YEARS OF DID DEBILITATING DEBT PLEASE JOIN US AND SUPPORT AB TWENTY FIVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M AS OUR GARRETT WITH OPPORTUNE WE ARE A COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHICH IS A U. S. TREASURY CERTIFICATION. FOR LENDERS THAT DO THEIR LOANS WITH THE MISSION FOCUS. A OUR MISSION IS FOCUSED ON FAMILIES WITH LITTLE OR NO CREDIT WE'RE ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE LENDERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BOTH WITHIN THE CFL ANA INTO IN THE LOAN SIZE THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY BUT ALSO IN THE CALIFORNIA PILOT PROGRAM FOR RESPONSIBLE ACCESS TO TO CREDIT. I'M OUR LAWS HAVE HELPED OUT OVER HALF A MILLION CALIFORNIA'S. ESTABLISHED EFFORTS CREDIT SCORE NINETY PERCENT OF OUR THE FAMILIES WE SERVE LIVE IN ALLEN MY COMMUNITIES AND UP FOR THE MOST PART ARM. OF THIS. BILL AS PROPOSED AND CURRENTLY AMENDED UP ALLIANCE WITH THE MONEY THAT WE DO AND CAN USE THAT WE SERVE. OF ONE APPLIED MISTER KALRA AND THAT THE SPONSORS FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. AND THANK THEM FOR THEIR ENGAGE WITH US AS WE'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH THE DETAILS OVER LARGE THE THERE THERE IS SOME IMPROVEMENTS ON THE MARGINS. FOR THE MOST PART AGAIN THIS IS A BILL A THAT WE FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU. CHAIR AND MEMBERS HIS AND MARTIN DEL WITH CONSUMERS UNION OF RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THAT TRIES TO PROMOTE FAIRNESS IN THE MARKETPLACE. YOU KNOW WE HAVE LONG BEEN IN STRONG SUPPORT OF EFFORTS LIKE THESE TO PROVIDE SENSIBLE RULES OF THE ROAD SO THAT RESPONSIBLE LENDERS CAN FLOURISH AND THE IRRESPONSIBLE FOLKS CAN GO HOME. I CALIFORNIA AS A GRACILIS SAID HAS REALLY FALLING BEHIND OF MANY OTHER STATES HAVE MOVED FORWARD IN OF RECOGNIZED THAT A BUSINESS MODEL THAT DEPENDS ON. TRIPLE DIGIT RATES AND A BUNCH OF PEOPLE DEFAULTING TO MAKE A PROFIT IS NOT A JUSTIFIABLE BUSINESS MODEL AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE DEAL THE DATA. THAT WE HAVE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT OR WE HAVE SOME WONDERS THAT. TRY TO CAP THEMSELVES AND YOU TRY TO CHARGE RESPONSIBLE RATES VERSUS THOSE WHO DON'T THE DEFAULT RATES ARE WAY LOWER HOW THE FOLKS WHO ARE MAKE TOUR DOING RESPONSIBLE ONE DAY. SO I YOU KNOW I THINK THE IN AN ART CONVERSATIONS WITH MANY OF YOU I'M ON THIS COMMITTEE A ONE THING I THINK WE CAN SAY. IN GENERAL IS THAT EVERYONE AGREES WE HAVE A PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM IT'S A PUBLIC POLICY PROBLEM IN A MARKET FAILURE THAT WE NEED TO FIX. SO I URGE YOU ALL TO DO WHAT PREVIOUS COMMITTEES IN PREVIOUS YEARS IN PREVIOUS SESSIONS HAVE NOT HAD THE COURAGE TO DO WHICH IS TO REALLY TACKLE THIS ISSUE. SO WE'RE IN VERY STRONG SUPPORTER THIS MEASURE AND WE REALLY ARE WE URGE YOU TO WHAT ADVANCE OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY. AND WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE SETTING STRONG RULES OF THE ROAD HERE IN CALIFORNIA FOR LARGER INSTALLMENT LOANS THAT.

DIET UNDER STERN MANNER WILL TAKE IT UP TO HEAR. FROM THE THREE OF YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF MY NAME IS DAN GWALTNEY. I AM THE CEO PAY MONEY CENTERS AS WELL AS ON THE PRESIDENT THE CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. I'M I ALSO AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND SPECIFICALLY THE STAFF OF THE COMMITTEE. OF AND THE TWO GENTLEMEN HAVE DONE A LOT OF EFFORT THEY'VE OPENED OUR DOORS WE'VE HAD. NO PROBABLY OVER TWELVE MEETINGS ARE SO TO TRY TO BETTER INFORM THE FORM THE COMMITTEE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE MAKING POLICY DECISIONS BASED ON DATA. AND THAT'S WHAT'S CRITICAL TO US AT THIS TIME UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. AND I'M GONNA GIVE YOU SEVERAL REASONS WHY THAT IS TRUE THIS IS COMPLEX ISSUE. UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THAT. THE DATA THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE REALLY OF WHAT WE HEARD IS COMING OUT OF ANNUAL REPORTS. UP FROM THE DEPARTMENT THIS OVERSIGHT ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT HELPFUL THERE SOME DATA THAT'S MISSING FROM THOSE REPORTS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THIS REQUIRES RIGOROUS. SOME ACADEMIC ANALYSIS THAT. WHAT WE HEARD TODAY FROM THOSE THAT ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I DIDN'T HEAR A WHOLE LOT ABOUT WHERE THE CONSUMERS ARE GONNA KILL? ONCE THERE IS A RATE CAP WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR REMOVING RESTRICTIONS OVER FIVE THOUSAND THAT WERE STILL WE'RE STILL BUT TWENTY TO MY MATH. UNDER FIVE THOUSAND WERE STILL LOOKING AT OVER SIXTY PERCENT OF THOSE AND IN THAT LONE CATEGORY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO. GET A LOAN UNDER THIS CURRENT BILL STRUCTURE. THOSE RATE CAPS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER STATES. WE ASK WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE WHEN THE STATE'S PUT IN A THIRTY SIX PERCENT. RATE CAP WE CAN LOOK AT MULTIPLE STATES THAT HAVE DONE THIS GEORGIA NORTH CAROLINA REPORT DEBT COLLECTION COMPLAINTS GO UP CHAPTER SEVEN BK'S GO UP. CLUB AND BOUNCED CHECKS GO UP AFTER THE REMOVAL OF THESE OPTIONS MONTANA SAME THING THEY HAD THEIR REPORTING UNREGULATED LOANS IT OVER HER A THOUSAND PERCENT. OF WENT UP AND THERE'S ONLY A HUNDRED FIFTY US STOREFRONTS THERE'S ONLY EIGHT REMAINING AFTER EIGHTEEN REMAINING OREGON SAME THING COMPLAINTS ONLINE UNREGULATED. ONLINE LENDING A DOUBLED OF THE DISTRICT COLUMBIA. UNDER A UNREGULATED UNLICENSED LENDERS WERE DEAFENING PEOPLE'S BANK ACCOUNTS THEY WERE CHARGING OVER TWO THOUSAND PERCENT IN THE ABSENCE OF TRADITIONAL UP. REGULATED LENDERS AND MOST RECENTLY WE HEARD ABOUT SOUTH DAKOTA WILL WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT RATE CAPS PUT IN PLACE PEOPLE WERE NOT ABLE TO GET LOANS ANYMORE. SIXTY TWO HUNDRED SIXTY TWO LENDERS SHUT DOWN ONLY LEAVING A HALF A DOZEN OR ON THE GO TWENTY FOUR LENDERS STILL REMAIN. HOWEVER THE CREDIT UNIONS WHICH IS EVERYBODY EXPECTS WILL STEP UP THEY DIDN'T THEY DIDN'T SEE ANY INFLUX OF NEW BORROWERS. BUT IN FACT THE THAT THE PROPONENTS OF THE THIRTY SIX PERCENT RATE CAP IN SOUTH DAKOTA SET UP A SPECIAL FUND OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO DO WITH THIS. THEM DANCING ALONE OUT OF IT CONSUMERS OF THE CREDIT COUNSELORS HAVE REPORTED THAT THERE ARE MORE COMPLAINT OR THAT THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT CREDIT PROBLEMS DIDN'T GO DOWN WHEN THE RATE RESTRICTIONS PUT IN PLACE. SO WHAT IS THAT SAYING THAT SAYING THAT THIS DOES ELIMINATE CREDIT THOSE CUSTOMERS THAT DON'T HAVE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND LOANS. BUT WE'RE TALKING THAT THERE'S A LOT OF CONSUMERS THAT NEED HELP BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND AND THE END REPORTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT. I'M SURE YOU GUYS READ IT IT DOESN'T SAY HOW MANY CUSTOMERS THERE ARE. AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO COULD GATHER MORE DATA SO UP OR TRADE ASSOCIATION AND I AS A MATTER WOULD ALSO ASK YOU TO VOTE NO. WHEN YOU SLOW DOWN AND ANALYZE THIS BEFORE WE MOVE IT FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF COMMITTEE MEMBERS JOINT COMMITTEE PRESIDENT CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA SPENT CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE. HAD IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OTHER CHEC. THROUGH OUR NETWORK OF FIFTY FIVE CHAMBERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE REPRESENTS THE INTERESTS OF THE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND HISPANIC BUSINESSES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. OUR ISSUE HERE IS IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S WHO ARE NOT ARE NOT CONSIDERED NON PRIME AND. WHICH INCLUDES MANY OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES SO PROPRIETORS NEED AND DESERVE ACCESS TO CREDIT. JUST LIKE PINE CALIFORNIANS DO MANY TRADITIONAL THE TRADITIONAL LENDING INSTITUTIONS EITHER CANNOT OR OR OR WILL NOT SERVE THESE CONSUMERS. MANY CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLE STRUGGLE TO GET A CREDIT ACCESS THROUGH TRADITIONAL BANK BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE PRIME CREDIT SCORE AND MANY BANKS DON'T MAKE LOANS BELOW THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SPECIAL. RESTRICTING THESE CALIFORNIANS ACCESS TO CREDIT DOES NOTHING TO ADDRESS THEIR UNDERLYING NEED FOR CREDIT JUST MAKES IT HARDER FOR THEM TO GET A LOAN WHEN THEY FACE UNEXPECTED EXPENSES. ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES AND ENSURE THAT ALL CONSUMERS HAVE ACCESS TO SAFE. RELIABLE CREDIT OPTIONS A WHEN THEY NEED IT I LEGISLATION SUCH AS AB TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND OTHER. BOB BILLS THAT YOU'LL BE HEARING A LOT LATER WOULD ELIMINATE LEGITIMATE REGULATED SHORT TERM CREDIT WITHOUT VIABLE ALTERNATIVES. THESE HURT RATHER THAN HELP OUR CONSUMERS AND SMALL BUSINESS SOLE PROPRIETORS. INSTEAD CALIFORNIA SHOULD FOCUS ON PROTECTING CONSUMERS ACCESS TO A RANGE OF SAFE CONVENIENT LICENSE ALONE OPTIONS. ENSURING THAT CONSUMERS COULD PAY BACK THERE ARE THEIR LOANS IS NOT ONLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO. IT IS ALSO GOOD FOR BUSINESS BUT ATTEMPTING TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL THROUGH RATE CAPS AND OTHER ARTIFICIAL WAVES OF RESTRICTING SMALL DOLLAR LENDING ONLY SERVES TO PUSH RESPONSIBLE. LICENSE COMPANIES OUT OF THE MARKET WHILE DOING NOTHING TO ADDRESS CONSUMERS UNDERLYING NEED FOR CREDIT WITHOUT ACCESS TO SAFE RELIABLE CREDIT OPTIONS BORROWS MAY BE FORCED. RETURN TO TILLY ILLEGAL OFFSHORE LENDERS TO GET THE MONEY THEY NEED. WE URGE LEGISLATORS THE FOCUS ON COMMONSENSE REGULATIONS THAT PROTECT CONSUMERS AND ELIMINATE BAD ACTORS WHILE STILL PRESERVING ACCESS TO CREDIT PERJURED OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I APPRECIATE YOU ALLOWING ME TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE TODAY. MY NAME IS MELISSA SOBRE OF WITH CARAVAN CHILL TECHNOLOGIES WE OPERATE IN THREE COUNTRIES BOTH IN STORE AND ONLINE. WE'VE BEEN OPERATING FOR TWENTY YEARS IN FACT OUR FIRST STORE WAS RIGHT HERE IN RIVERSIDE CALIFORNIA. OUR OPERATIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDE THIRTY SIX SPEED CASH STORES SPEEDY CASH ONLINE IN A VIA CREDIT. LAST YEAR. WE ORIGINATED MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED MILLION AND CONSUMER LOANS IN CALIFORNIA. IF AB WORDPAD AB TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED WERE TO PASS WE WOULD IMMEDIATELY CEASE OFFERING LOANS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED IN CALIFORNIA IMMEDIATELY. PROVIDING CREDITS NAM PRIME CONSUMERS WITHIN OR IMPAIRED CREDIT FILES IS EXPENSIVE TO DO AND I KNOW YOU'VE ALL HEARD THIS AND IT'S HARD TO. ON WITH TRULY COMPREHEND THE COMPLEXITY SALEMME JUST SHARE A FEW DATA POINTS ABOUT OUR BUSINESS. WE HAVE A PROPRIETARY SCHOOL CREDIT SCORING MODEL THAT HAS BEEN BUILT USING DATA FROM OVER SEVENTY FIVE MILLION COMPLETED APPLICATIONS IN OVER A LOT ELEVEN THOUSAND DEED OF ARAB BILLS. WE PURCHASE DATA FROM AT LEAST FIFTEEN DIFFERENT SUB PRIME SPECIALTY BUREAUS IN INTEGRATED WITH OUR DISCREDIT SCORING CARD AND WE DO THAT WITHIN SECONDS. WE SERVICE OUR CUSTOMERS THROUGH EXTENDED STORE HOURS A FULLY STAFFED CALL CENTER. AND INTEGRATED ONLINE AND MOBILE OPERATIONS. OUR COST OF CAPITAL IS IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS BECAUSE OF OUR INDUSTRY RISK PROFILE. TO OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA ALONE WE MAINTAIN A HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO LICENSES WE FOLLOW STATE REGULATIONS AND WE FOLLOW EIGHTEEN FEDERAL REGULATIONS. WOULD LOVE TO BE A BANK WITH ONE SIDE OF REGULATIONS THAT WOULD BE FAR MORE SIMPLE. FROM OUR NAME IS CARO. IT'S ACTUALLY THE NAME OF OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THAT WITH HAS BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS TO SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATE OUR OPERATIONS FROM LOAN APPLICATIONS TO SERVICING. AS A LARGE AN ESTABLISHED LENDER IN THE MARKET. LET ME SHARE WITH YOU SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR BUSINESS. OUR INSTALLMENT LOANS ARE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO PERCENT APR IN OUR TITLE LOANS ARE NINETY SIX PERCENT APR. WE DO NOT CHARGE LATE FEES OR NSF FEES AND IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR A CUSTOMER TO COLLISON ASKED TO EXTEND THEIR DUE DATE BY A COUPLE OF DAYS. CUSTOMERS COMPARED ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLE ON THEIR LOAN OR RE PAINFUL AT ANYTIME WITH NO PREPAYMENT PENALTIES. IN FACT A MAJORITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS PAY BACK THEIR LOAN IN LESS THAN A YEAR REGARDLESS OF THE CONTRACTUAL TERM. SO THE ONLY PAY FOR THE TIME WHICH THEY USE THE FUNDS. FIRST IS FOR UNSECURED INSTALLMENT LOANS OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OUR ANNUAL. THE AVERAGE ANNUAL GROSS INCOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS IS JUST OVER FORTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND LAST YEAR WE APPROVED ABOUT HALF OF THE LOAN APPLICATIONS AND OF THE LOAN APPLICATIONS THAT WE APPROVED THE AVERAGE FICUS SCORE WAS SIX TWENTY FIVE. NOW REMEMBER PSYCHO SCORE TELLS US VERY LITTLE ABOUT OUR ACTUAL CUSTOMER INTO THE OTHER ROOM AND I HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT THAT. YES WE INTEGRATE DATA FROM A NUMBER OF THINGS IN OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE HELD THEIR JOBS MORE THAN SEVENTY PERCENT OF OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN IN THEIR JOBS FOR MORE THAN TWO YEARS. SO I ASK YOU TO DAY TO VOTE NO ON AB TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND ALLOW. LEGAL REGULATED LENDERS LIKE OURSELVES TO CONTINUE TO SERVICE THIS CUSTOMER. THANK YOU NOW I WILL ASK. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE AND STATE YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION IN YOUR POSITION MENDED TO EXCLUDE THE COSTA VOLUNTARILY PAUL TERRY CREDIT INSURANCE FROM THE CAP.

THOMAS LEONARD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATION FIFTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE STAR FRONT MEMBERSHIP WE OPPOSE. COMMITTEE. MEMBERS I. SINCE OUR TIME FOR QUESTIONS OR REMARKS. YOUR GRAYSON. I WOULD ALLOW THAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO. BOTH THE AUTHOR AND AND THOSE THAT SUPPORT AS WELL AS TESTIMONY FROM OPPOSITION. AND KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE ALSO. BROUGHT FORTH. DATA I WOULD AGREE DATA IS PARAMOUNT TO BEING ABLE TO. FORMULATE AUTHOR AND PUT TOGETHER GOOD LEGISLATION AND AB PROVIDE POLICY. SO. SPEAKING OF WHICH WE'VE BEEN ASKING. AT LEAST FROM MY OFFICE FOR DATA AND. IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TRYING TO GET. DATA FIRST OF ALL I THINK YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY SAID THIS BUT HOW MANY STATES ACTUALLY HAVE A CAP OF THIRTY SIX. IN THE SPACE OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO FIVE THOUSAND. I BELIEVE IS TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE OF THEM. TWENTY ONE STATES AND. IS THERE DATA TO SHOW WHAT THE IMPACT OF THE EFFECT OF THAT CAP. DOES. WHEN IT'S INSTITUTED. WELL THERE'S BEEN. YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT PART OF THE ISSUE BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE DON'T. GET DATA AND ASIDE FROM THE INDUSTRY. THAT LEADS TO GET IT FROM. THE THE AND THE STATE'S ABILITY TO GET DATA AND DIFFERENT STATES HAVE DIFFERENT. I OPPORTUNITY GET DATA AND SO WE HAVE SEEN IN SOME AND SAYS I KNOW THAT. ALTHOUGH THE MOVES INDICATION FOR THE REQUEST FOR RIGOROUS ACADEMIC ANALYSIS. IT WILL IT WAS REALLY FOLLOWED UP WITH ANECDOTES WITH THINGS THAT HAPPENED URBAN STATES WE HAVE SEEN THAT IN SOME STATES THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY ONCE YOU ACTUALLY ALLOW THE CAPS TO BE IN PLACE. THE ABILITY FOR A WEATHERBY NONPROFITS WHETHER IT BE BIG GOVERNMENT ENTITIES OR CREDIT UNIONS TO FILL THAT GAP. THEY CAN'T DO THAT WHEN THEIR IS. THOUGH THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF MARKETING OF THAT FRANKLY EVEN KEEP. IN SOME CASES. WILL CUSTOMERS FROM GOING TO THE MORE RESPONSIBLE LENDERS THAT ARE CLOSER TO THE AND AROUND THIRTY SIX PERCENT RANGE. I SAID YOU HAVE A MORE INFORMATION COULD MASK OSCILLATORY SPEAKS SPECIFICALLY TO SOME OF THE DATA FROM OTHER STATES YES PLEASE THANK YOU. REPEAT THE THE DATE I'M I'M JUST LOOKING FOR. WHAT KIND OF DATA IS OUT THERE? FOR THE STATE'S THAT DID INSTITUTE A CAP. BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OKAY I THINK YET SO THE THE MOST RECENT REPORT THAT WE HAVE ON THAT IS FROM THE NATIONAL CONSUMER LAW CENTER. IN THE STUDY THAT THEY DID IS ACTIONS BUT TO A TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR LOAN AND SO THERE ARE THIRTY FOUR STATES THAT HAVE. THIRTY SIX PERCENT AND LOSS OF A. VOTE OF ANY PR FOR THOSE SPECIFIC LOANS. UP SO THERE IS NOT A SPECIFIC STUDY OF THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO TEN AT THIS POINT. SO SPEAKING TO AND THE SORT OF THE ANECDOTAL OF OF WHAT IS SPEAKING PEW DID DO A STUDY OUGHT SAID LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED AFTER RATE CAPS AND AND AND BASICALLY. FOLKS ARE GOING BACK TO WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE DONE ORIGINALLY BEFORE GOING TO THIS IS WHAT YOU FOUND SO. BORROWING FROM FAMILY AND FRIENDS GOING TO PAWN SHOPS. DIFFERENT THESE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE HAD TO DO TO ACTUALLY GET OUT OF IT AND WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE CHOSEN TO DO IN THE FIRST PLACE. ON IF I CAN GIVE ONE CALIFORNIA EXAMPLE OF A PERSON WHO GOT A CAR TITLE LOAN SHE I I THINK I MENTIONED THIS TO YOU. TO YOU BEFORE ABOUT IT'S A CAR TITLE LOAN AND IT WAS. LIKE TWO HUNDRED PERCENT APR IN AND RIGHT I APPRECIATE THAT IT DOES BUT I'M LOOKING FOR. SOLID DATA. IOWA AND THAT IS HERE SO MAYBE OPPOSITION WOULD THAT MOVEMENT BUT WHATEVER I COULD WHAT WENT BEFORE IT IF I COULD. GIVE YOU ONE. PIECE OF DATA THAT I THINK IS RELEVANT UP BECAUSE WHEN THE PILOT WAS PUT IN PLACE WAS ALSO ARGUMENTS THAT IT OF THE MARKET THOUGH THE WILL BE NOT BE ACCESS TO CREDIT. WHAT WE FOUND WAS FROM TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE REDUCTION INCREASE OF APPLICATIONS OF A SEVENTEEN PERCENT INCREASE APPLICATIONS AND LOAN APPROVAL RATES INCREASE OF FIFTY PERCENT? FIFTY TWO POINT FOUR PERCENT DURING THAT TIME PERIOD AND SO THAT'S. THAT'S HARD DATA BUT IS A PILOT PROGRAM BUT WITH THREE HUNDRED TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT SHOWS THAT THE MARKET DOESN'T GO AWAY. THAT IMPACT THEIR STILL ACCESS AND DIED OF EVEN IN NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS ACTUALLY WENT UP DURING THAT TIME PERIOD. AND WOULD OPPOSITION HAVE DATA THAT WOULD REFUTE THAT WELL IF WE IF IF WERE POINTING TO THE PILOT PROGRAM I WOULD SAY THOUGH IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THERE'S A HUNDRED NINETY FIVE LONG HUNDRED NINETY FIVE THOUSAND LOANS UNDER THE PILOT. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN IT WENT UP SIX THOUSAND LOANS COMPARED. TO OVER TWELVE MILLION PAYDAY LOANS DURING THAT SAME PERIOD OF TIME EVERY YEAR. PAYDAY LENDERS DO MORE PILOTS IT DIDN'T DO MORE LOANS THAN PILOT LENDERS DO THEY DO WITH THEM IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF. OF JANUARY THE PILOT PROGRAM LENDERS DO ALL YEAR LONG I THINK THE PILOT PROGRAM WAS A ATTEMPT TO TRY TO SATISFY UNDER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED BUT THE DATA SHOWS. THERE ARE NOT MANY PILOT LOOK PROGRAM LENDERS I BELIEVE THERE'S ONLY THREE OR FOUR THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING ANY LANDING. AND CUSTOMERS ARE STILL GOING TO DIFFERENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS SUMMER TO OUR MEMBERS TO GET WHAT THEY NEED. UP AND THEN IT'S FOR SOME OF THE OTHER STATES THERE'S BEEN INVESTIGATE REPORTS THAT SHOWS. THAT COMPLAINTS HAVE GONE UP IN NEW YORK OF IN YOUR FEDERAL RESERVE DID A STUDY YEARS AGO THAT SHOWED WHEN. I'M ACCESS TO CREDIT WAS DENIED IN NORTH CAROLINA. CLUB AND GEORGIA IT SHOWED THAT THERE WERE INCREASES AND WATCH LIKE I MENTION OUR TESTIMONY THOSE NEGATIVE EFFECTS THAT I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED. OKAY OF AYE AND I APPRECIATE THAT. STILL LOOKING FOR SOME SOLID GROUND ON ON ON THE DATA THERE. WHAT TERM JUST REAL QUICK I DON'T OVER THERE WOULD BE FROM INDUSTRY OR WHAT BHUTTO WENT IS THE LOOK OF DENIAL RATE RIGHT NOW UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM FOR LOANS BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND? WOULD ANYBODY HAVE THAT INFORMATION AS FAR AS WHAT. AND. WE APPROVED ABOUT ONE HALF OF ALL LOAN APPLICATIONS THAT WE RECEIVED LAST CALENDAR YEAR OKAY SO OUT OF THAT ONE HALF. HOW MANY OF THOSE LOANS WOULD ACTUALLY ENTER INTO A A DEFAULT STATE IT IF THERE WAS THIS STATE LIKE THAT HOW MANY OF THOSE LOANS WOULD GO INTO DEFAULT? SO ARE DEFAULT WE. WE HAVE ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF OUR LOANS THAT WE ORIGINALLY IN CALIFORNIA DO OF THE LOAN AMOUNT THAT WE ORIGINALLY IN CALIFORNIA DOES END UP IN THE FALL. SO IF THEY END UP THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A THIRD OF THE LOANS RICHARD GIVING OUT END UP IN THE FALL SO NOW I'M STARTING SEE WHY IT'S SO EXPENSIVE. SO. OUT OF THAT THIRD THE END UP IN DEFAULT. HOW MANY OF THE THIRD DO YOU CHARGE OFF SO FOR THE UNSECURED IT IS IT'S ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF THE AMOUNT THAT WE ORIGINATE FOR AUTO TITLE LOANS IT'S IN THE HIGH TEENS? I WOULD COUPLE THAT NUMBER WITH OUR ACTUAL AND WE PUBLICLY REPORT OUR NUMBERS ARE A NET MARGINS LAST YEAR WERE FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT. SO IF YOU CAN SEE IT IS VERY FOR OUR CUSTOMER BASE UNDERWRITING OUR CUSTOMER IS A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DO. BUT WE TRY OUR BEST TO SERVICE OUR CUSTOMERS. OKAY SO YOU A THE WAY YOU SERVICE YOUR CUSTOMER. THEN IS BY ALLOWING ACCESS TO CAPITAL THAT OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD ACCESS TO. AT A VERY HIGH RISK. CORRECT OKAY SO. BASICALLY THEN IT. CAN I GO BACK TO THE. THE THIRD THAT ENDS UP IN DEFAULT. HOW MUCH OF THAT PERCENT ACTUALLY ENDS UP BEING CHARGED OFF OF THE THIRD? IS THAT THE WHOLE THIRD THE GETS CHARGED OFF OR IS IT. WE CAN LOOK IF YOU IF YOU DON'T MIND WE CAN LOOK AT THE PILOT PROGRAM BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN THAT IS SET AT THIRTY SIX PERCENT WERE RESTRICTING. OF ACCESS UNDER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED I THINK THAT WE DO HAVE NUMBERS FROM THE REPORTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. AND WHAT THAT SHOWS AND THE PILOT THAT ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT OF LOANS GO INTO DEFAULT AT SOME POINT THEY'RE LATE PAYMENTS. AND THEN OF THOSE THIRTY PERCENT THE CHARGE OFF RATE I BELIEVE IT'S TEN PERCENT OKAY END UP AND TEN PERCENT COMPARED TO LET'S SAY IF WE GO BACK TO PAY DAYS BEING A SMALL DOLLAR EXAMPLE. THOSE ARE MORE LIKE THREE PERCENT. SO WE'RE SAYING THAT IT'S A. THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS SO THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE THEM WHEN YOU SAID FIVE. THINGS FIVE POINT SOMETHING PERCENT CORRECT ARE YOU RIGHT CREDITS LAST YEAR PROFIT MARGIN WAS FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT. OKAY. THE PROFIT MARGIN FOR THE AND YES FOR OUR COMPANY FOR YOUR COMPANY OKAY SO I WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR THE ACTUAL CHARGE OFF. BECAUSE IT WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IS YOU HAVE TO. YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY IN ORDER TO STAY IN BUSINESS. YOU'VE GOT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO SUBSIDIZE AND COVER FOR THE CHARGE OFFS. AT A HIGH RISK IN A HIGH RISK INDUSTRY IS THAT RIGHT. WELL YES I ALSO LIKE TO MAKE THIS POINT SOURCE THE COST IS OBVIOUSLY THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL TALKING ABOUT WHY ARE THESE LOANS BEING CHARGED AT THIS RATE THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION RIGHT SO WHAT WHY IS THAT OCCURRING WELL IF YOU LOOK AT THE COST STRUCTURE AND I. THINK THAT'S WHAT THE REASON WE NEED TO DO A BIT BETTER ANALYSIS THE. THE CFL AND REPORT CONSOLIDATES A LOT OF COMPANIES RIGHT INTO HIM MORTGAGE LENDERS IN THEIR. AUTO TITLE LENDERS INSTALLMENT LENDERS ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF LENDERS AND SO IT'S ALL BLENDED IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO LOOK AT EXACT DATA. FOR THIS PARTICULAR PART OF THE INDUSTRY BUT WHAT WE DO SEE IS THAT. OUR TYPE OF COMPANIES WE MEET WITH THE CUSTOMERS. MAJORITY TUMBLE ITEMS ARE STOREFRONTS WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE CUSTOMER NOT ONLY DO THEY TAKE UP A LOT OF THE STUFF AT THE STORE FRONT. WHICH REQUIRES PHYSICALLY MENTALLY UNDERWRITING A LOT OF TIMES ARE PULLING IN DOCUMENTS FROM THE CUSTOMER MAKING SURE WE CAN SEE THEIR BANK STATEMENT READ IT. OUR ONLINE LENDERS DO THAT AT THE SAME TIME BUT A LOT OF US THAT HAVE STORE FRONTS WE SEE THAT CUSTOMER EVERY MONTH WHEN THEY COME IN TO MAKE THE PAYMENT. MEAN MOST BANKS DON'T EVER SEE THE CUSS WORDS AGAIN ON ON ON AN AUTO LOAN OR HOME LOAN. SOMEWHERE HIGH TOUCH SO THAT PRODUCES THERE'S LABOR COSTS THE RISING OCCUPANCY COST TO HAVE STORE FRONTS SO IT AND THESE ARE HIGHER RISK CUSTOMER BASE. SO THEIR CUSTOMERS THAT OBVIOUSLY BOMB WERE NOT APPROVING SO WE HAVE TO ALSO UNDERWRITE WAS APPLICATIONS AND WE TURN THOSE ARE TURNED DOWN UNDER THE PILOT PROGRAM I BELIEVE THAT THE. THE APPROVAL RATES ABOUT THIRTY FIVE PERCENT FOR CUSTOMERS THAT WALK INTO A STORE FRONT. SO. THEY ARE THAT THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS THAT SHOWS WHY THIS IS A LITTLE BIT MORE OF AN EXPENSIVE LOAN. OF THEN LET'S SEE MORE TRADITIONAL CREDIT CARDS OR FRAUDULENT SO NO DOUBT AND AND AND AND I DON'T MEAN TO A. UNDER MINOR OR QUESTION YOUR INTEGRITY NO DOUBT THERE ARE GOOD PLAYERS. THAT ARE LOANING IN THE SPACE OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TO FIVE THOUSAND EVEN TEN THOUSAND I GET THAT. AND THEY ARE JUSTIFYING THEY ARE USING DATA TO TRY TO TO DO WITH A GOOD BUSINESS MODEL. HOW? BUT HOW MUCH WE'RE TO WHAT DEGREE IS THERE UNDERWRITING A IS UNDERWRITING TAKING PLACE IN THE PROCESS OF YOU GIVING UP THOUGH BELONGS. WELL I'D LIKE TO SAY IS REQUIRED BY LAW. NONE OF US CAN DO ALONE HEARING CALIFORNIA WITHOUT DOING UNDERWRITING. OF IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS THAT BELIEVE IT'S CODE SECTION OF FOURTEEN SIXTY TWO. THAT REQUIRES MEANINGFUL UNDERWRITING THE DEPARTMENT HAS THE ABILITY TO COME IN AND AUDIT EACH LENDER. BOMB IS AUDITED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT AND THERE'S REQUIRE UNDER EXISTING LAW THAT WE HAVE TO UNDERWRITE. SO I MEET OUR OUR OPINION IS THAT INSTEAD OF IMPOSING BECOME A BARRIER TO ENTRY TO CREDIT WITH THE RATE CAP. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE MAY BE BEHAVIORS OR SPECIFIC THINGS WE WANT TO DO ABOUT UNDERWRITING I KNOW OUR INDUSTRIES OPEN TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS AS OPPOSED TO MAYBE TAKING A CHAINSAW. TO THIS SEGMENT OF THE MARKET AND MAYBE COME AT IT WITH A SCALPEL. AND WE CAN HONE IN ON IT BUT RIGHT% NOW THERE'S ALREADY A CALIFORNIA COURT REGULATION SPECIFIC THE LENDERS MUST UNDERWRITE. WE CREDIT SCORE EVERY SINGLE APPLICATION BOTH SECURED AND UNSECURED. AND WHEN THE DB O. COMES INTO AUDIT OUR FIRM THEY ASK US A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT CFL REQUIREMENT WE PROVIDE INFORMATION AND WHAT WE DO AND UNDERWRITING. OKAY. I JUST WANNA ADD KIND OF THE DATA POINT THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR WE'VE ASKED NOW. SECOND YEAR IN A ROW FOR DATA FROM THE LENDERS TO SEE WHY IT COSTS SO MUCH WE HEAR STOREFRONTS WE HEAR YOU'VE GOT YOU KNOW YOUR EMPLOYEES BUT THEN WE LOOK AT THE ONLINE LENDERS AND WE WONDER WHY DO YOU CHARGE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. WHY DOES YOUR WEBSITE SAY YOU APPROVE IN THREE HOURS AND WHAT'S GOING ON THERE AND THEN THE REPORTS THAT WE SEE FROM TVO SHOW? LOAN ME HAS NINETY NINE PERCENT OF THEIR LOANS ARE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT APR HIGHER WHAT KIND OF UNDERWRITING IS HAPPENING WHERE NINETY NINE PERCENT OF YOUR LOANS. ARE AT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OR HIGHER AND THAT'S THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE ONES THAT ARE HIGH COST LOANS AND USER SECURED BY YOUR VEHICLE THESE. I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THE COST AND WE HAVE ASKED FOR THAT DATA POINT THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR NOW WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN IT AND WHEN WE KNOW THERE'S PROPRIETARY INFORMATION FOR BUSINESSES AND THERE'S FOR WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THERE'S A THIRD PARTY THAT CAN PUT THE STATE OF. TOGETHER WE HAVEN'T SEEN IT. AND CHAIR I'M NOT TRYING TO MONOPOLIZE THE THE MEETING HERE I JUST HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS. QUESTION SO WE HAVE A DOG SORRY YEAH OTHERS THERE IS ONE OTHER DATA POINT ON CASA DIDN'T COME UP LEAST GOING TO GO BACK TO THAT SITE TO THE NUMBER SO OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS. I DO HAVE A OF JUST COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS I WANT TO HEAR HIS RESPONSE BUT THEN I HAVE A COUPLE MORE. AND THEN ALL OF. I DEFER TO YOU TO HAVE OTHER MEMBERS ASK QUESTIONS AT THAT I WANT TO COME BACK TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS. THANK YOU SIR IT WAS A PRISONER WAS ONE DATA POINT THAT WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT WHICH IS PARAMOUNT FOR ALL LENDERS IS HOW DO YOU GET YOUR MONEY AS A LENDER WHAT'S THE COST INVOLVED WITH THAT. TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT CAN LEAD TO THIRTY SIX BELOW A LOT OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS ARE BORROWING MONEY. BANKS CREDIT UNIONS ARE GETTING THEIR MONEY NEXT A NEXT TO ZERO WITH THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE. OF OUR TYPES OF OF LENDERS THERE MOST OF OUR PRIVATE AND SO OUR COST OF CAPITAL OR IN THE TEENS SUCH ANYWHERE BETWEEN FOURTEEN TO EIGHTEEN SOME LIP. COMPANIES ARE PUBLICLY TRADED THAT THAT IS AVAILABLE IN THEIR TEN K. REPORTS HERE SINGS HIGH IS EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN PERCENT. SO WE HAVE TO THEN TURN AROUND AND OBVIOUSLY EGGS AB ABSORB THAT COST TO CAPITAL. INVITE BUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. THINK YOU THINK MANAGER I'M. AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE BUILDING IN FOURTEEN TO EIGHTEEN PERCENT. THAT IS ACCOUNTED FOR INTO THESE LOANS AND THEY'RE GOING OUT OF THE BOOK THE PRIVATE MARKET AND GETTING LOANS AND AND MONNING THEM OUT BUT I WILL MAKE THEM MENTIONED THIS ACTUALLY STRAIGHT OUT. OF THE COMMITTEE REPORT. OF REGARDING THE UNDERWRITING UNPAVED FIVE IN THE MARKET FOR HIGH COST INSTALLMENT LOANS ADDRESSED BY THIS BILL THERE IS NOT A STRONG MUTUAL INTEREST. BETWEEN LENDERS AND BORROWERS BY CHARGING HIGH INTEREST RATES LETTERS CAN GENERATE ENOUGH REVENUE TO PROFFER ALONE EVEN BORROW EVENTUALLY DEFAULTS. THIS MISALIGNMENT OF INTEREST CREATES AN INCENTIVE OF UNDERTOW BOYD THE COSTS ASSOCIATED UNDERWRITING WHICH RESULTS IN BORROWS ACCEPTING LAWS THEY CANNOT AFFORD. DATA FROM THE DDO SO THAT SOME OF THE LARGEST CFL MANNERS IN CALIFORNIA GENERATED PROFITS IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN DESPITE LOAN CHARGE OFFS AS A PROPORTION OF ORIGINS OF THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY FIVE PERCENT. AND SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT. IT IN AND AS WAS REFERRED TO BY GRAZIELLA. BUT YOU HAVE HUNDRED PERCENT. INTEREST RATE ON A AND UP. THERE'S A REASON WHY THEY'RE ABLE TO. BUT APPROVED LOANS THAT OTHERWISE WOULDN'T BE APPROVED IS BECAUSE THEY CAN MAKE A PROFIT OFF ENOUGH ALONE EVENTUALLY IS DEFAULTED ON OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF. OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT AND DAHLE GO BACK IN. MAKE MYSELF MORE FAMILIAR WITH THAT. BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE THAT PART OF IT. WHEN IT COMES TO ORIGINATION FEE ASSEMBLYMEMBER KALRA. IN EUROPE IN THE CURRENT LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. IT SAYS THAT. IN SPEAKING OF IT THAT IT COULD BE UP TO SEVEN PERCENT OF THE BALANCE OF THE LOAN. FOR NINETY DOLLARS WHICHEVER IS HIGHER. YOU'RE GUARANTEED AT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS YOU'RE GUARANTEED THAT NINETY DOT OR OUTSIDE NOT HIGHER WHATEVER'S LOWER SO SEVEN PERCENT OR NINETY DOLLARS WHICHEVER IS LOWER. YOUR GUARANTEED AT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO NEVER BE AT SEVEN PERCENT BECAUSE NINETY DOLLARS IS GUARANTEED TO BE LOWER. STRAIGHT ACROSS THE BOARD AND IT ONLY GOES UP FROM THERE. SO THOUGH THE THE ORIGINATION FEE THAT'S BEING CHARGED IS BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THIS IS GONNA BE NINETY DOLLARS STRAIGHT ACROSS THE BOARD AND NOT SEVEN PERCENT. BECAUSE WHEN I WAS IN CONVERSATION. WAS STAKEHOLDERS IT WAS THEIR UNDERSTANDING AND ALSO MY UNDERSTANDING I I DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE NINETY DOLLARS. THAT IT WAS THE SEVENTY OR SEVEN PERCENT THAT WOULD BRING UP FROM THIRTY SIX TO FORTY TWO PERCENT THAT WAS KIND OF A. AN ANGST BOOK SOMETHING THAT THEY WERE WILLING CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT AS FAR AS WHAT THE DISCREPANCY IS THERE YEAH IT WAS IT WAS DRAFTED A IN A MANNER THAT IT WAS THE NINETY DOLLARS WAS NEGOTIATION CERTAINLY THAT OCCURRED BUT SOME OF THE. FOLKS INDUSTRY THAT WERE WHEN TO COME TO THE TABLE TO TALK ABOUT IT. AS OPPOSED TO SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS WHICH WAS A WHICH IS ORIGINATION UNDER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. IN WHEN IT WAS DROPPED TO PUT SEVEN OR NINETY WHICH I AGREE DOESN'T MAKE MUCH SENSE WILL REVISIT THAT BUT. BUT NINETY DOLLARS OF WHAT IS WHAT WAS INTENDED OKA BUT I'M HAPPY TO BUT YOU KNOW BUT IF THIS GOES TO COMMITTEE PECAN. MEDINA TALK ABOUT THAT* SORRY THAT'S THE REASON IS A DRAFTING YOUR THAT'S. IN THE PILOT AND WE PICKED UP THE LANGUAGE FROM THE PILOT THANK YOU. THAT AND THE INTENTION OF NINETY DOLLARS OPENS AND SALAS IDENTIFIED SINCE THE PILOT OBVIOUS IS A LOWER AMOUNT THAT THAT. THAT MADE SENSE FOR THE LOWER AMOUNT. RIGHT SO PILOTS UP TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED YEAH SO I CAN SEE WHY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE BUT. ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT. SEVEN PERCENT IS NOT THE INTENT AND THAT IT'S THE NINETY DOLLARS THAT'S THE INTENT CAR. OKAY AND I AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT IS POINTED OUT AND IT CAN BE ANALYSIS AND. IT MAY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA WILL YOU BE ACCEPTING THE COMMAND ME COMMITTEE AMENDMENT THAT ARE IN THE ANNOUNCES YES THAT IT WAS ALSO POINTED OUT DURING THE MEETING WE HAD LAST TUESDAY. WITH WITH STAKEHOLDERS. THAT WAS AYE MEETING OPEN ALL OF THEM THAT I ATTENDED THROUGH SKYPE IT WAS ALSO BECAUSE IT WAS A QUESTION THAT ONE OF THE LENDERS ASKED ABOUT ITS WAS CLARIFIED THAT IT WAS. THAT WAS US OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE WORLD ARE NOW SO NOW WEDNESDAY'S INSTEAD OF IT BEING THIRTY SIX WITH AN ORIGINATION FEE THAT COULD TAKE IT OF FORTY TWO. IT'S NOW THIRTY SIX PERCENT WITH A NINETY DOLLAR FEE THAT WOULD AT THE MOST RECENT TO THIRTIES THAT THIRTY NINE POINT SIX PERCENT FOR MAGIC FORTY TWO POINT NINE. THAT'S WITH SEVEN PERCENT NINETY DOLLARS. ALRIGHT I'LL HAVE TO THAT THE NINETY DOLLARS TAKES MY THAT WAS LESS THAN NINETY DOLLARS AN INCREASE FROM THE SEVENTY FIVE. FOR LOANS UNDER TWENTY FIVE HONORS THE NEGOTIATION REALLY WAS UNDER THE SEVENTY FIVE OR NINETY AND SO THE AGREEMENT WAS THAT YES YOU CAN ACTUALLY GET MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS. ON THESE HIGHER DOLLAR LOANS OVER THEIR HEADS UP TO NINETY DEGREE SO THAT I DOLLARS POINT OF CONTENTION DATA ANYWAY I'M NOT REALLY UP ON HERE BUT I'M NOT HERE TO WORK ON THAT AS WELL. OKAY SORRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON YES AND THEN. DO YOU BLOOM. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT. IF THERE IS A CORPORATION OR A COMPANY THAT IS MAKING LOANS AND THOSE LOANS ARE VERY HIGH RISK AND I THINK EVERYONE HERE WOULD AGREE THOSE LAWS ARE VERY HIGH RISK. THEN THAT. THAT CORPORATION COMPANY SHOULD BE GIVEN THE OPTION. OF. OFFERING VOLUNTARY. LOAN INSURANCE. I THINK AND WHAT THE COUPLE THINGS ONE IS THAT IF. COMPANIES ARE OFFERING. HIGH RISK LOANS. AND THEIR INTERESTS ARE ALIGNED WITH THE CUSTOMER IN THAT THEY ACTUALLY. DESIRE THE CUSTOMERS ARE TO PAY OFF THE LOAN. THEN I THINK THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE A WORLD THAT WE'RE NOT CURRENTLY IN. IF YOUR TALKING ABOUT IT AND AND ALTHOUGH I BUT I'M GLAD YOU RAISED INSURANCE POINT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I COMMIT CONTINUOUS TALK ABOUT INSURANCE BECAUSE I THINK I'VE READ ABOUT THIS GUY THAT THIS HOUSE THE COMPANY VIEW THAT. MIGHT. IMPRESSION OF INSURANCE WAS VERY DIFFERENT IN THIS WHOLE JOURNEY STARTED. AND I'LL BE TALK TO SOME. THE BILL TAUGHT LIVE WORK GOING TO CONTINUE TO TALK TO FOLKS THAT YOU OFFER INSURANCE THAT INDICATED THERE INSURANCE SOMETIMES IN THE ONE TO ELEVEN DOLLARS A MONTH RANGE NOT THE HUNDRED TWO DOLLARS A MONTH RANGE. OPERATE WE'RE COMMITTED TO KEEN TO TALK TO THEM THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT CREDIT INSURANCE AND ANYWAY. SO DOES ALLOW FOR IT. BUT IF THERE IS SOME KIND OF BUSINESS MODEL THAT A COMPANY HAS WHERE. THE CUT INSURANCE IS NOT EGREGIOUS AND AS PART OF HOW THEY OPERATE AND PROTECT THEMSELVES AND PROTECT THE CONSUMER. THEN YES ABSOLUTE I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS ON CREDIT INSURANCE MOVE THAT WOULD THAT WOULD NOT BE WITHIN THE PARAMETER OF THE CAP. I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE PARTY COMES AT WE HAVE ABOUT CONVERSATION ALRIGHT AND THEN. CREDIT REPORTING MY LAST QUESTION CHAIR. THAT OBJECT THANK YOU CREDIT REPORTING BECAUSE I SEE HER FINGER ON THAT MIKE SHE'S BUT THE TURN ME OFF. WHAT ADVANTAGES THAT FOR THE CONSUMER? SENATE HOW COULD WE WORK THAT. IN A CONVERSATION SO ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO FURTHER TALK MY CREDIT REPORTING. LA WOULD WANT TO SEE YOU BUT THE COSTS ARE ASSOCIATE WITH THAT BECAUSE OF COURSE. IT THERE ARE COSTS ASSOCIATED THEIR PASS ON THE CONSUMER THAT ALSO WORKS INTO THIS WAS HIS WEAKNESS WORKS INTO THE OVERALL CONVERSATION OF. OF. THEY THE INTEREST RATE WHAT HAVE YOU BUT I AM COMMITTED ARE AND HAVE INDICATED THIS THE CHAIR THAT I THINK IT'S AN ABSOLUTELY FAIR ISSUE TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS ON ITS CREDIT REPORTING. AND LOOK FORWARD TO TALKING TO YOU SPECIFICALLY MORE ABOUT THIS AUDIT DISCUSS WHO COMMITTEE PRIOR TO IT. AGAIN INTO FOUR AND BUT QUITE POSSIBLY HIGHER TO GET INTO APPROPRIATIONS BILL. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL QUESTIONS AND I JUST WANNA ACTUALLY TO CLARIFY THAT THE ANALYSIS PROVIDES THAT IT SHARES A NUMBER OF CONCERNS ARE NOT AMENDMENTS BUT. SHOP THEY OUR CONCERNS AND ONE OF THE ONES THAT WAS IDENTIFIED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON IS I'M IN THAT ANALYSIS. THANK YOU MEMBERS A. ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER I JUST HAVE A A KIND OF SIMPLE QUESTION ON HOW THIS ACTUALLY WORKS HAVE A COMMUNITY THAT. YOU REALLY CAN'T GOAL BLOCK WITHOUT SOME SORT OF LOAN AVAILABILITY. IF SOMEBODY WALKED IN TO ONE OF YOUR. FRANCHISES AND ASK FOR A LOAN I'M. FAMILY MEMBER OF MINE AND YOU RAN THEIR CREDIT SCORE AS PART OF TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT YOU CHARGE. AND THEY HAD A GOOD CREDIT SCORE WOULD THEY BE DIRECTED TO A MORE REASONABLE. LOAN PORTION OR IS THERE A MINIMUM PERCENTAGE THAT YOU'D BE CHARGING. FOLKS. IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO ALERT CUSTOMERS ON TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE. ALTERNATIVE MODELS WITH. BANKING OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY. COULD ACCESS IT IF IF. THERE WERE MORE UP PLACES AVAILABLE. FOR TRADITIONAL MONTHS RIGHT. SO CUSTOMERS TYPICALLY COME INTO OUR STORE THEY FILL OUT AN APPLICATION WE ASK THEM. FOR SOME BASIC INFORMATION AND THEN WE LET THEM KNOW WHAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR SO ARE THE PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE IN OUR STORE IS AN AUTO TITLE LOAN IF THEY. MEET THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THAT OR NON SECURED LOAN OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OR PAYDAY LOANS. SO WE DON'T NECESSARILY DIRECT THEM TO OTHER PLACES WE DON'T KNOW NORMALLY FIND THAT THAT'S THE SITUATION EITHER BUT NOT NORMALLY BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO COME MEN RIGHT WHO I. PROBABLY COULD. DO MUCH BETTER IN THE MARKET IF IT WERE AVAILABLE. IN IN THE IF I COULD BUT THEY JUST USED AS. YOU KNOW BALANCING OUT THE RISK. I WOULD SAY THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT DO WALKING ENTER ENTER THE FACILITIES ARE MAY APPLY ONLINE WITH LICENSE ONLINE LENDERS HAVE ARE EXPLORED THOSE OPTIONS. THEY'VE BEEN TURNED DOWN BY THEIR BANK OR CREDIT UNION THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THEY DON'T THEY'RE NOT QUALIFYING FOR. THE YOU KNOW THIRTY SIX PERCENT ARE UNDER UNDER LOAN IN FACT I KNOW THAT SEVERAL LETTERS HAVE REPORTED THAT WHEN THEY RUN CREDIT AS PART OF THE UNDERWRITING. THEY SEE THE INCREASE FROM THE TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL SORT THERE'S NO DOUBT AND WE'RE JUST TALKING. NIGHT IF THAT RIGHT BUT IF IF YOU KNOW IF MY DAUGHTER WALKED INTO THE CORNER STORE. WHAT I JUST FOUND IT TO BE AN EXTREMELY HIGH CREDIT SCORE FOR A TWENTY TWO YEAR OLD? STOP IT THERE WOULD BE NO. SUGGESTION THAT SHE MIGHT BE BETTER SERVED WITH A LOAN UNDER THE PILOT OR BY GOING TO A TRADITIONAL BANK BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN UNBANKED. SO SPECIFIC ALL TALK ABOUT MY STORES I OFFER I'M A FIGHTER FOR THE PILOT PROGRAM. SO THEY CAN WALK IN AND THEY CAN DO IT HAD A LONG. THEY COULD DO A PILOT PROGRAM ONE OF THE QUALIFY. AND THEN WE ALSO OFFER THE LOANS FOR AUTO TITLE IN IN INSTALLMENT WE HAVE A MYRIAD OF FINANCIAL PRODUCTS FOR PEOPLE TO QUALIFY. SO IN THAT SITUATION THAT PERSON DOES QUALIFY FOR PILOT PROGRAM WON'T WE'RE GOING DIRECTLY TO THE PILOT PROGRAM ONE. A LOT OUR EXPERIENCES WHICH WOULD BE THIRTY SIX PERCENT RIGHT THROUGH WELL ACTUALLY THE PILOT PROGRAM IS A THIRTY SIX PERCENT INTEREST RATE BUT THOSE EIGHT THOSE AP OURS ARE IN THE SIXTY PERCENT THE TOP OUT AT SIXTY PERCENT. SO. THAT PERSON IF THEY QUALIFY THAT THEY WOULD BE DIRECTED TO THAT PRODUCT. IN YOUR STORE IN MY STORE AND I ALSO KNOW THAT MANY STORES THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT HAS PRODUCED DATA UP OR I'M SORRY PRODUCED FLYERS THAT A LOT OF MEMBERS. IN OUR TRADE ASSOCIATION HAVE THOSE AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS THE WHEN THEY WALK IN THEY DO SEE OTHER OPTIONS. LOT OF THE LONG CONTRACTS THAT ARE PRODUCED BY LAW THE LENDERS WILL ACTUALLY HAVE IN THE FEDERAL REQUIRED LOAN DOCUMENTATION USUALLY A BOX IT DOES SAY THIS IS A HIGHER COST CREDIT YOU MAY HAVE OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU. BUT THESE I THINK ARE ARE DEFINITELY THINGS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO GET WITH. THE AUTHOR ON ITS INSTEAD OF JUST IMPOSING A RATE CAP BECAUSE THAT JUST IT JUST STOPS ALL DISCUSSION IT JUST THESE LETTERS WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO EVEN OFFER THAT. THAT SUGGESTED WHEN CUSTOMERS WALKING INSTEAD OF JUST TURNING AWAY. I'M I'M JUST CONCERNED BECAUSE I I FEEL LIKE WHEN I ASK THESE QUESTIONS I DON'T GET REALLY ANSWERS I GET LIKE THIS MIGHT HAPPEN IN MY STORE OR THAT. PEOPLE DON'T REALLY COME IN WITH GOOD CREDIT OR THEY TRIED OTHER THINGS IN. AND I'M I HAVE A CHALLENGE COMMUNITY A CHALLENGE COMMUNITY THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE UNBANKED OR HAVE NEVER HAD A TRADITIONAL LOAN OR DON'T KNOW THEIR CREDIT SCORE OR DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY GO. AND YOU CAN'T GO TO THE CORNER BECAUSE THEY DON'T EXIST. RIGHT AND SO WHEN EVERY OTHER BLOCK IS SOME SORT OF PRODUCT THAT. HAS AA LOAN PERCENTAGE THAT THAT PUTS PEOPLE INTO A CYCLE OF POVERTY. CERNAN OBVIOUSLY SO I'M JUST KIND OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY. OR OR WHITE WE DON'T HAVE HER DAD AND I HEARD FROM THESE QUESTIONS TOO I'M GETTING A LITTLE. DISCOURAGE THAT THIS INDUSTRY THAT SO HIGHLY REGULATED AND. IN SO MANY STATES. HAS NO HARD DATA ON WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING OR MAYBE THERE IS DATA THAT WE JUST DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO TO TELL US. YOU KNOW THIS MANY PEOPLE COME IN WITH THIS CREDIT SCORE THAT THESE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO TAKE CARE OF AYE I'M CONCERNED THAT A LOT OF. I'M GOOD HARD WORKING FOLKS TO HAVE DECENT CREDIT SCORES IN MY COMMUNITY ARE PAYING THESE HIGH RATES FOR PEOPLE WHO REALLY SHOULDN'T BE OFFERED ALONE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND SO OBSCENITIES RIGHT THIRTY PERCENT MIGHT BE DEFAULTING BUT THAT MEANS SEVENTY PERCENT ARE NOT. AND THEY'RE STILL PAYING THOSE RATES IN THEIR PAIN FOR A VERY LONG TIME SO I'M JUST I'M I'M TRYING TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION IT'S BEEN EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING FOR ME. AND I GET DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF INFORMATION FROM DIFFERENT FOLKS AND I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU TO BUT NOT YET. I JUST SO IS THIS DATA IS THERE A REASON WE CAN'T LIKE. HAVE THIS DATA DOES IT NOT EXIST. BUT I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION MISS FLETCHER THAT'S WHY I THINK ALICE LET'S LET'S ARE THINKING SORRY SIGN OF THAT IT WOULD BE. WE WOULD ADVOCATE FOR MORE DATA I MEAN NOT LIKE AND THE SOME OF THE THINGS WE MENTIONED THAT THERE'S DISCLOSURES THE INDUSTRY DEATH ONLY ONCE ADDITIONAL IF WE IF REQUIRE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES OF SOMEBODY COMES IN AND THEY NEED TO BE REFERRED TO. IF THEY'RE PRIME CUSTOMER IN THEIR PRIME LOANS AVAILABLE OR NOT AVAILABLE THE INDUSTRY WOULD LOVE TO LOOK AT WILL LOOK AT THINGS LIKE THIS I THINK THESE ARE THE TYPES OF. OF. DATA POINTS THAT UNFORTUNATELY IF THIS BILL GOES FORTH AS WRITTEN WE'RE NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS ANYMORE IT'S JUST TO RECAP. IT'S DONE. THAT DICK THE THE LONE TWENTY WILL BE AVAILABLE AT OUR RATES ARE ANY RATES PRETTY GOOD FOR A LOT OF OUR LENDERS ARE JUST GONNA STOP OFFERING ALL ENDING. I'M INTO MY QUESTION TO TO THE ADVOCATES ARE AYE I HEAR A LOT IN THIS IS I HAVE A HARD TIME WITH THIS ARGUMENT THAT THINGS IF IF. THE MARKET GOES DOESN'T WORK OUT CRACKED. THE WAY WE WOULD HOPE THAT. PEOPLE ACTUALLY LEAVE. AND AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE LOANS. IF IF I HAVE. VERY BAD CROSSWORD NO CREDIT SCORE IN MIAMI. MOTHER DIES WHERE MY GETTING A LOAN TED BURY HER. CAN CAN I JUST ASK CHAIR WOMAN. IF MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CONSUMERS UNION AND MISTER KALRA AS TO TO HAVE ANOTHER ADVOCATE IF THERE'S GONNA BE MORE QUESTIONS AS WELL OR. JUST A LITTLE OUTNUMBERED WITH THE INDUSTRY ORDER ABOUT MIGRATION STRICTLY IT YOU DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN LIVE IN ANSWERS WELL I'M JUST KNOW THAT I I HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT. SO WE CERTAINLY CAN HAVE A BALANCED. FOLKS ON ON THE DIET SO IF IF ONE OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE WE CAN ASK SOMEONE AND AT THIS MOMENT TIME I THINK THE QUESTION WAS YET THROUGHOUT IT TYPICALLY AND HOPES TO SUSAN FROM CONSUMERS UNION. SO YEAH BUT WAIT I'M NOW I'M LOOKING AT DAD ON THE OTHER SIDE IN THE STATES WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN CAPPED HOW DO WE KNOW THAT. SOME PEOPLE AREN'T JUST. GOING UNDERGROUND BASICALLY TO TRY TO GET ENOUGH MONEY TO FULFILL WHAT OUR BASIC NEEDS AND SOCIETY SURE AND AND THAT'S THAT'S A WONDERFUL POINT BECAUSE FOR YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE WORKED. FOR MANY YEARS FOR THE LATINO COMMUNITY AND TWENTY PERCENT OF LATINOS HAVE A ZERO CREDIT SCORE OR NO CREDIT SCORE. AND THAT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO MANAGE THEIR MONEY IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE PAYING CASH. SO THIS IS THIS IS THE ISSUE WE HAVE IS THAT THE STORES ARE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND AND TARGETING THEM AND SO EXACTLY TO YOUR POINT NOT BUT I WANT WHAT I WANT. SPECIFICALLY I'M ASKING HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN THE STATES WHERE WE HAVE FEWER LENDERS NOW AND IN TIMES OF DIRE STRAITS WITH THAT WHICH I ALSO SO. ALIKE AS I'M I'M FROM MARYLAND WHICH IS A STATE. HAS EVER HAD PAYDAY LOANS LOW INCOME FAMILY AND WE WHAT YOU HEAR ABOUT ARE THE NON PROFITS BECAUSE OF THE MARYLAND IS THE BIGGEST NONPROFIT THAT. HAS RESOURCES TO HELP FAMILIES CATHOLIC CHARITIES MY MOM WAS GIVEN A SECURED CREDIT CARD SHE STARTED WITH ENCYCLOPEDIAS AND YOU START UP YOU HOW MANY IMMIGRANTS ARE THERE IN MARYLAND IT'S A HUGE IMMIGRANT POPULATION MOSTLY FROM ALL SALVADOR AND CENTRAL AMERICA. AFRICAN AT THIS SCALE TO CALIFORNIA. I I I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBERS BUT THERE I'M GONNA ASK HIM AND JYJ. IF WHAT RATIO PRICE RATIO WASN'T JUST NOTICE MOST THEY A BILL SO SO I I APPRECIATE CATHOLIC CHARITIES I'M JUST TRYING TO GET AGAIN DATA NOW TO UNDERSTAND IN A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT HAS A. TRULY HUGE BOTH PERCENTAGE HIGHER PERCENTAGE AND. SHEER NUMBER THAT MARILYN OF OF IMMIGRANTS IN AND PAINT. IN PARTICULAR YOU KNOW WHERE WHERE WHERE NOT. WE HAVE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES IN THE NONPROFIT WORLD TO TAKE CARE OF OUR ENTIRE COMMUNITIES I'M JUST TRYING TO GET AGAIN LIKE A HEARING. OF THE STATES THAT HAVE. CAPPED. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE CAPPED THE PERCENTAGE A NIGHT AND I HEARD AT ONE POINT WAS THIRTY FOUR STATES ANOTHER TWENTY ONCE I'M NOT EVEN SURE HOW ME STATES IT IS. ARE THEIR STATES. THAT ARE SIMILAR TO CALIFORNIA IN SIZE IS IT NEW YORK IS A TEXAS NEW YORK. NEW YORK HAS IT HAS AS A TWENTY FOUR PERCENT RECAP NEW YORK HAS A TWENTY FOUR PERCENT CAP OKAY IS THERE. DATA ON WHAT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IN NEW YORK. RELY UPON. OF CERTAIN I WOULD HAVE TO HOW LONG HAS AYE CAPTAIN IN PLACE OTHER THERE'S NEVER BEEN PAID IN THE NAME ALLOWED IN NEW YORK. OKAY BUT WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT PAYDAY LENDING ALL I CAN ABOUT THE ENTIRE RIGHT SO USERS SO USUALLY USURY LAW HAS NOT OUT. TO ALLOW PAYDAY LOANS YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO. IT HAD BRING IN A LAW TO ALLOW THE PAYDAY LENDING IN THE HIGH COST LENDING TO TO FLOURISH SO NEW YORK HAS NEVER HAD IT SO SO IF I NEED TO BORROW TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN NEW YORK AND I'M UNBANKED WHAT A WHITE DEL. SO AGAIN SO THE NONPROFITS THE CREDIT UNIONS STARTING WITH A SECURE CARD. AND THAT'S TOUCH JUST THERE'S THE CIRCLE LOANS BUT FOUND US THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT COMMUNITIES TO COME TOGETHER DURING THE DHAKA. CRISIS ALL THE. MEXICAN CONSULATES WERE GIVING AWAY GRANTS THERE WAS MISSION ASSET FUND OUR CREDIT UNION THE SELF HELP FEDERAL CREDIT UNION WE ACTUALLY TURNED OUR LOANS WITH ZERO PERCENT. EIGHT INTEREST RATE LOAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO TO REACH THE PEOPLE THAT NEEDED THE EMERGENCY DOC ALONE SO WHAT'S THE CAP ON. I'M SORRY AND I'M STILL I FEEL LIKE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENT THINGS IT WHAT IS THE CAP ON IF I. NOT ME BUT YOU NOW FIND WANTED TO GO GET ALONE AND I'M IN NEW YORK AND I WON A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR LOAN WHAT WHAT IS. IT AT EAST MONTANA PAYDAY LENDING OBVIOUSLY THAT'S TOO HIGH BUT WHAT IS IS OUR CAP WELL HERE HERE'S EXECUTIVE THERE'S A CAP IN THEIR SOME GOOD DATA TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IF PEOPLE CAN'T GET WHERE THEY GO. AND I'M GONNA USE THE EXAMPLE FROM THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL SERVICES. WHO ORDERED THIRTY FIVE LENDERS TO SEIZE LANDING IN STATE? TO STATE RESIDENCES AND THIS IS IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOR ACTUALLY LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AS WELL. SO PEOPLE SO HERE'S THE POINT. IF LOANS GO AWAY THE DEMAND DOES NOT GO AWAY. THERE'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE THAT MAY FIND OTHER OTHER IN STATE OPTIONS BUT THE VAST MAJORITY. YOU HAVE LENDERS COMING IN FROM OUT OF STATE. THESE LENDERS ARE NOT LICENSED BY THE STATE AND ARE NOT REGULATED BY THE STATE THE CONSUMERS CAN GET THE LOANS THEY'RE JUST NOT. UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF STATE AUDITORS AND REGULATORS WHAT IS A CAP AT NEW YORK'S I'M SORRY I BELIEVE IT'S THIRTY SIX PERCENT BUT I I I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE BUT IT LEAVES THIRTY SIX ALL I KNOW IS THAT ART FROM OUR INDUSTRY DOES NOT LEND IN CITY AND. IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE UNLICENSED. NON STATE REGULATED LENDERS WHO ARE LANDING IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK NOT YOU KNOW THAT BASED ON THAT IS THAT HAPPENING CALIFORNIA. WELL YES WE DO WE HAVE TO KNOW THAT WILL RIGHT NOW AND THE NICE THING HERE IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT WE DO HAVE A RIGHT WE DO HAVE REGULATED LENDERS. LENDERS ARE REGULATED WE CAN TALK ABOUT THE INTEREST RATE WE STILL HAVE AND WE HAVE A HELL AND LICENSED. LENDERS FROM OUT OF STATE DELPHI SO IT HERE'S A PROXY WE CAN TALK ABOUT HOW DO WE GET TO THAT BECAUSE THIS IS NOT FOUND IN THE DEPARTMENTS AND REPORTING THAT'S WHY WE'RE SAYING WE NEED MORE DATA BEFORE WE MAKE SUCH A SERIOUS. DECISION TO IMPOSE A RATE CAP IN AND AND THAT'S YOU KNOW FROM THE STORIES WE MENTION% IN STATES THAT HAVE DONE THAT WHAT HAPPENS. SO THAT'S WHERE WE CAN GET ADDITIONAL DATA ON THIS AND THAT MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING I KNOW ONE PAYDAY THE. YEARS AGO THE PART WAS ASKED TO STUDY WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT UNDER CFL. CAN. CAN I JUST AB ONE LAST THING TO IT SO BICU DID DO A REPORT IN IN STATES THAT. THAT DON'T HAVE THAT DO HAVE RATE CAPS AND THERE IS AN ARGUMENT THAT THEY MOVE TO UNREGULATED UNLICENSED LENDERS AND PEW FOUND THAT THAT WAS UNTRUE. AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA TWO YEARS AGO THERE WAS A SUPREME CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT RULING AGAINST US THAT. ARE THERE ARE TRIBAL LENDERS WHO CAN DON'T. HAVE TO FOLLOW THE RECAP BUT THE SUPREME COURT RULING MADE IT SO THAT THE LENDERS HAVE TO PROVE THEIR TRIBAL CONNECTIONS AND MAKE SURE THAT. PAYDAY LENDERS ARE NOT JUST YOU KNOW ATTACHING THEMSELVES TO THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES ALL THAT. WHICH WE HAVE TROUBLES ARE LENDING INCOMPLETE PICKUP. ABOUT YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN I THOUGHT ON AT LIKE SEVEN JANET MAYBE I. WILL RESPOND TO THEM YEAH LOST TOUCH AND THEN AND I KNOW WE HAVE SEVERAL OTHER MEMBERS KNOW THAT TICKET THAT'S OKAY AND I THINK AT THE AUTHOR HAS. A RESPONSE TO YOU WE HAVE SEVERAL OTHER MEMBERS WELL AND TO ADDITIONAL BILLS THAT WILL BE HEARD YES. SO THAT LOOKED AT ME THAT THE ARGUMENT FOR ANY KIND OF REGULATIONS THAT WILL THERE'S COMING ON REGULAR MARTIN PEOPLE GONNA BREAK THE LAW. YES THAT COULD BE ARGUED THAT WE MAY BUT THE REALITY THAT WHY IN PLACES LIKE NEW YORK. THEY HAVE THESE OTHER ENTITIES THAT ARE STEPPING IN IS BECAUSE THEY'VE NEVER HAD. SCOURGE OF THESE. ALL OF THESE HIGH INTEREST RATE. BUT ENJOY LENDERS AND SO GREAT YOU KNOW WILL HAVE ON REGULAR COME IN BUT THE REGULATED ONES ARE ALREADY CHARGED THE SAME WITH UNREGULATED WHO IS GOING TO CHARGE THE LITERAL HOW WE REALLY BENEFITING. THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THE REALITY IS THAT CHANGE DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. BOB RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE THERE ISN'T ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH WE HAVE TO ADJUST OUR MARKET. THERE TWICE MANY CFL LENDERS IN THE ARE MCDONALD'S IN CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY IS TALKING OVERNIGHT AND SENATE INCUMBENT UPON US. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO DO WE CAN'T PROTECT CONSUMERS UP BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN EVEN IF THEY DON'T PEOPLE THAT A LOT OF FOCUS ON DEFAULT. HERE THEY DON'T DEFAULT WE HAVE TO GO TO FRIENDS AND PAWN SHOPS NOT JUST TO PAY BACK THE LOAN. BUT THEN I'LL HAVE A THREE THOUSAND ALONE THE CONDUCTING EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THE GET STRING ALONG. AND WE DO HAVE DATA THAT BIGGER PUBLISHER THROUGH DPO DI BILL AND THEN LET ME MAKE ANOTHER POINT. THE INDUSTRY CAN GIVE US DATA ADVOCATES BATTER DATA THEY HAVE THE NUMBERS. WE DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS NOT AMONG THE NUMBERS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE. THEY HAVE THE NUMBERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE. LET'S MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR AS WELL THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT DATA THE DATA DOES EXIST WE'RE NOT PRIVY TO ALL OF IT. BUT WE DO HAVE SOME DATA AND SOME OF THE DATA INDICATES WE LOOK AT THE THE. LENDERS THERE ARE. THERE ARE A VAST MAJORITY LENDERS THAT DO NOT. DO NOT GIVE LOANS BELOW SEVEN PERCENT WHEN I SEE SEVENTIES ACTUALLY SEVENTY NINE EYES MAYBE THEY'LL GET BELOW NINETY I DON'T KNOW BUT. THAT THERE OF. THE IMPASSE OF NUMBER THAT VERY RARELY GIVE BELOW. AND SO SOME OF WHAT'S GOING DOOR AND COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR SIXTY FIVE. HT FIFTY. THE LUCK OF THE THE OTHER TO MAXIMIZE THEIR PROFITS AND THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE'S NOT ALL LINEMAN OF INTEREST BETWEEN THE CONSUMERS. AND THESE LENDERS NOW THE ONES THAT ARE OPERATING AND THERE'S A NUMBER OF THEM YOU KNOW ONE MAIN. OPPORTUNITIES OF THERE'S A FEW FROM HERE THAT THE LOANS ARE ALL. AND FORTY PERCENT OR UNDER. NOW DOES THAT MEAN THAT THERE ARE SOME THE FOLKS THAT ARE GOING TO GET ACCESS TO CREDIT WELL YES AND THAT'S WILL BE PART OF OUR. JOB TO ENSURE THAT WERE MAKING SURE THEY GET ACCESS TO RESPONSIBLE CREDIT. NOT ACCESS TO TRIPLE DIGIT RATES THAT ARE GOING TO HAVE THEM GOING THERE'S DOWNWARD SPIRAL OF DEBT. AND SO DO WE HAVE WHAT NEW YORK CAST TODAY OF COURSE NOT BECAUSE NEW YORK'S NEVER HAD THESE LOANS CAN WE HAVE THAT SOMEDAY YES WEEKEND. WE CANNOT THAT SOMEDAY IF WE MAKE A COMMITMENT AND DON'T FEEL THE POOREST PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY. TIME AND AGAIN WHEN IT COMES. THANK YOU AND NEXT WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHEN FOLLOWED BY CALDERON THAN. BUT YOU MADAM CHAIR OF THIS QUESTIONS FOR A THE OPPOSITION ALSO PUT SPEAKER. ON THE AUTHOR. ENTERS OF RACE FOR THE ONLINE LENDERS. LICENSE AND A LICENSE WHERE THE RACE FOR THE LICENSE ON ONE WONDERS AND HOW DO THEY COMPARE. UNLICENSED ONLINE WONDERS. WHAT WE LEARNED ONLINE AS I SAID OUR UNSECURED RATE HAS A HUNDRED% AND THIRTY TWO PERCENT APR? FROM THE. TIME I DON'T KNOW IN GENERAL WHAT THE TRIBAL LENDERS. CHARGE I THINK THEY HAVE A LESS EFFICIENT MODEL LIKELY CHARGE A HIGHER A PR. THE ILLEGAL OFFSHORE LENDERS WILL CERTAINLY CHARGE A HIGHER A PR. MY FAULT QUESTION IS. I'VE BEEN TOLD. MOTHER QUICKLY AND CORRECTLY THAT THIS BILL TREATS ALL LOANS. THE SAME INTERNET SECURITY UNSECURED THAT WAS TOLD THAT THERE MIGHT BE A RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. ON THE WANTS TO HEAR FROM THE AUTHORED THAT'S TRUE AND ALSO THE SECOND THING IS WHATEVER RISK PROFILE ARE YOU SAYING THAT IT MIGHT AFFECT THE CONSUMER. SO THE SO WHY DOES THIS TREAT SECURED UNSCREW LEADING THE SAME MANNER IT'S BECAUSE IN EFFORTS DIRECTLY ON SECURE LAWS BEEN PURSUED OTHER STATES MANY LENDERS SPECIALLY THOSE WHO CHARGE. INTEREST RATES OF A HUNDRED PERCENT OR HIGHER SIMPLY MOOD REQUIRE THAT ALL THEIR LOANS BECOME SECURE BY AUTO TITLE AS A RESULT MANY FAMILIES OPPONENT OF THE DEATH TRAP AND LOSING. END UP LOSING THEIR VEHICLES ARE PAYS LIENS ON THE PROPERTY RATTLING ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER ONLY INCENTIVIZE FURTHER PREDATORY PRACTICES. SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE PEOPLE LOSE THEIR VEHICLES ARE GONNA HAVE MORE PEOPLE THAT PUT UP OTHER TYPES OF COLLATERAL AND THEY'RE GONNA LOSE IT. SO DOESN'T TOP THE PRACTICE AND CHANGES THE BAY THE NATURE OF. FIFTH SOMETHING OF SO IF THEY'RE IF IT WIN WIN CALIFORNIA PASSES A RECAP OF FOR THE ONES THAT ARE ON LICENSE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOES HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE THOSE AND AND WE'VE SEEN IN STATES WHERE THEY ARE NOW AND VOIGTS IF YOU GIVE TO A. A A BORROWER IN A STATE WITH A RECAP AND IT IT IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THE RECAP THEY CAN BECOME NULL AND VOID. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. WHAT WHAT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT WITH THE RATE CAPS WANT YOU TO PUT IN IT? YES THE CAN WILL CONSUMERS POTENTIALLY GO ONTO A WEBSITE THAT IS NOT REGULATED THAT TECHNICALLY YES NOW BREAKING THE LAW THAT DOES HAPPEN. I MEAN DID A LOT OF THESE ANECDOTAL THAT WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT BUT THE. LIKE THAT WHAT WE SAID EARLIER TESTIMONY THE STATE REGULATORS OF THE STATE'S I'D LIKE TO KNOW. IF IF OUR STATES REACHED OUT FOR THOSE STATE REGULATORS MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE COMMITTEE SHOULD LOOK AT AND TALK SPECIFICALLY TO THOSE OTHER REGULATORS TO SEE. WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE HAVING THAT EXPERIENCE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE HEAR AND WE DEFINITION THE TRIBAL LENDERS ARE LENDING INTO STATES BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT REGULATED BY CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU CAN ASSIGN MACABRE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I. COME FROM EAST LA COUNTY I REPRESENT. ARE RELATIVELY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. I REPRESENT SOME OF THE POOREST. COMMUNITIES IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY. AND I BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO ACCESS CAPITAL WHEN THEY NEED. HAVE ACCESS TO THAT CAPITAL. AND. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. I'VE KEPT TRYING TO ASK BUT I I DON'T FEEL LIKE I GET. A CLEAR ANSWER ON AS YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF DETERMINING YOUR PROFITS YOU SAID YOUR COMPANY MAKES. FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT. PROFIT. HOW WERE YOU DETERMINING THAT PROVIDENCE AT FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT OF THE TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT YOU LENT OUT? THAT'S ACTUALLY AT ALL ON OUR TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES WHERE PUBLIC COMPANY AS IS TO OTHER VERY LARGE LENDERS IN THIS MARKET SO AS FAR AS LOOKING AT DATA THAT HAS A FULL PICTURE OF OUR LENDING OPERATIONS INCLUDING ALL OF OUR EXPENSES IN OUR REVENUES. THOSE ARE CERTAINLY AVAILABLE IN FAR MORE. ACCURATE THAN THE DV ó REPORTS SO THAT FIVE POINT ONE PERCENT IS OUR NET PROFIT MARGIN ALL IN FOR OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND AND DAY IN OUR FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES. SO IF IT'S BASED OFF OF HOW MUCH YOU'VE LET OUT HOW MUCH MONEY DID YOUR COMPANY LAND. THROUGH THESE LOANS. LYNN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. A IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE MADE A LITTLE BUT OVER SIX HUNDRED MILLION AND LOAN ORIGINATIONS IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING ALL THREE OF OUR PRODUCTS PAYDAY. UNSECURED ENTITLEMENTS SO THAT SIX HUNDRED MILLION CALIFORNIA ALONE FIVE PERCENT IS THIRTY MILLION. THE COMPANY MAY THIRTY MILLION. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THIS MARKET. BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THE LOAN THE LANDING IS TWO POINT ONE BILLION. AT ROUGHLY THAT'S HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION SO HE GETS. I MEAN. IT'S EASY TO SAIL WILL MAKE FIVE PERCENT. BUT THAT FIVE PERCENT REPRESENTS A PRETTY LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND IN ON AND I THINK IT SOUNDS SHOCKING. FIRST WHEN YOU HEAR ALL THAT SOUNDS LIKE A LOW MOUNTAIN. A LOW DOLLAR AMOUNT. ARE OR OR A LOW PERCENTAGE BUT THEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE ACTUAL DOLLAR AMOUNT. I'M IN THAT IS THAT THAT IS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR ONE COMPANY AROUND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE INDUSTRY WHEN IT COMES TO THESE LANDS WITHIN A GIVEN YEAR. AYE BECAUSE THIS TWO POINT ONE BILLION YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK YOU'LL FIND ANY MEMBER ON THIS DIET THAT WILL DISAGREE WITH A. WITH A BUSINESSES ABILITY OUGHT TO EARN A PROFIT OFFER PROVIDING A PRODUCT. I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WITH WHAT THIS PROCESS IS YOU KNOW COMMON WAS MADE EARLIER THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION AND WE NEED MORE TIME THE MORE TIME. BUT THIS IS AN ENGLISH THERE'S AND IT ISN'T A NEW ISSUE ARE THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT HOW MANY TIMES. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR HOW MANY YEARS NOW. AND YOU KNOW I TELL A LOT OF BUSINESSES. OR OR OR ORGANIZATIONS ARE INDUSTRIES THAT COME TO MY OFFICE. YOU KNOW BEING PROACTIVE ONLY SERVE YOU WELL IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE EITHER YOU'RE GOING TO IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES ON YOUR OWN AND COME UP WITH YOUR OWN FIXES. AND COME UP WITH. WITH OF WORLD THAT YOU CAN OPERATE WITHIN THAT YOU ARE THAT THAT YOU LIKE. OR AT SOME POINT TIME WE'RE GONNA DO IT FOR YOU AND YOU'RE GONNA LIKE BUT WE DO FAR LESS THAN WHAT YOU DO ON YOUR OWN BY BEING PROACTIVE. AND AND I AND AND I I KNOW ME PERSONALLY. OUT WHAT I I I DON'T WANT TO BE LEADING MY CONSTITUENTS TO INTO A POSITION WHERE THEY'RE HAVING TO TURN TO ONLINE LENDERS THAT ARE AND SECURED. YOU KNOW I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT. ALL PREDATORY ASPECTS WHEN IT COMES TO. A LOT OF THIS INDUSTRY. HOT AND NOT TO SAY THAT HAVING A BUSINESS AND BEING A BUSINESS OWNER MAKES YOUR PREDATOR BUT I THINK. YOU KNOW THERE IS CONCERN AND THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT STATE INTEREST. WHEN IT COMES TO WHEN YOU'RE THE ONLY PLACE TO GO. IS IT OKAY TO CHARGE WHATEVER INTEREST IN RATE YOU WANT. IS IT OKAY TO HAVE A HUNDRED THIRTY TWO PERCENT INTEREST RATE AND SO THE GETS IMPORTANT TO TO TO UNDERSTAND QUE WILL HOW DOES THAT FACTOR IN WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT. YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE ARE YOU ARE YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR YOUR FACILITY COSTS IN RENT. AND YOU'RE AND AND YOU'RE AND YEAH YOU NEED TO COST FOR LABOR. TO PAY YOUR EMPLOYEES YOU KNOW WHAT IS YOU KNOW THAT THE ENDING AMOUNTS YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE COMPANY MAKING IN THE AND IN. AND AND I THINK THAT FOR US. HERE WHAT WE WANT IS TO CREATE A MARKET THAT EXISTS THAT IS REGULATED. BUT ALSO IS FAIR AND EQUITABLE SO THAT I HAVE CONFIDENCE THERE WERE ALL OF THE STORES IN ALL OF THESE DOORS THAT ARE IN MY DISTRICT THATI DRIVE PAST EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT I'M HOME. THAT MY CONSTITUENTS ARE GOING IN THERE NOT GETTING SCREWED. BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO GO. THIS ISN'T ABOUT HERE'S AN INDUSTRY NEAR THE BOOGIE MAN AND YOU'RE THE BAD GUY DOES NOT AT ALL. MY FATHER HAS DONE A LOT OF WORK HE'S TO SIT ON THIS DIET A BE A MEMBER. OF THIS HOUSE A BOTH HOUSES WORKED A LOT ON THIS ISSUE AND HE ALWAYS BELIEVED ARE IN THE ABILITY FOR THOSE IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES TO HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL WHEN THEY WOULDN'T HAVE IT AN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES WHEN YOU. YOU KNOW YOU COULDN'T BANKING AND YOU NEED THE MONEY AND YOU COULDN'T FOR THINGS LIKE PAYING FOR FUNERAL. AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT DISAPPEAR BUT I ALSO I WOULD SAY THIS. I'M ABOUT WHAT'S FAIR. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY DESERVES ANYMORE OR ANY LESS THAN ANYBODY ELSE. I AND I THINK IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AS A BUSINESS TURN MONEY BUT I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE FAIR BASED ON WHAT YOU'RE ASKING. OFF FROM THESE MEANT THESE INDIVIDUALS TO BE PAID BACK MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE WE WANT TO KNOW. HOW WHAT IS THAT LOOK LIKE I DON'T THINK YOU KNOW FROM THE QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED TODAY IT'S REALLY CLEAR? WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S ARE STILL MEN FROM NATION THAT'S MISSING? ARM AND AND AND SO WHAT I REALLY WANT AND ARE WHAT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE IS OVER THE NEXT. COUPLE WEEKS AND MONTHS AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS PROCESS. TO GET MORE TO OPPOSED POSITION WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING BOTH THE INDUSTRY AND THE PROPONENTS. AND TO BE REASONABLE IN THE ASKS BECAUSE WE REALLY WANT TO FIND SOMETHING I'M COMMITTED TO FINDING SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR BOTH THE INDUSTRY. AS WELL AS ON MY CONSTITUENTS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND AND AND AND I I AND I NEED TO KNOW THAT. THEY'RE NOT BEING UP PUT INTO INTO A TERRIBLE POSITION JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. I AND SO I I WON I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR THE WORK ON THE COMMITMENTS THAT HE'S MADE TODAY I ALSO REALLY WANT TO THANK OUR CHAIR BECAUSE I THINK THERE CHAIR IS TAKING A LOT OF TIME TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND THIS INDUSTRY. AND HAVE ARE ARE REALLY HONEST DIALOGUE AND ENCOURAGE YOUR. YOUR COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH BOTH THIS CHAIR AS WELL AS THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. OUGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS THIS MOVE BILL MOVES ALONG WHICH I HOPE IT DOES TODAY. BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET ANY TYPE OF ANSWER TO THE CONVERSATION OUT OR OR ANY SOLUTION TO THE CONVERSATION IS A CONTINUE CONVERSATION. ON THIS ON THIS MATTER. BUT AYE BUT I HOPE THAT EVERYBODY'S CONTINUES TO ACT IN GOOD FAITH. A BECAUSE WE NEED TO FIND A SOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE I AM IS BETTER TO DO IT ALL TOGETHER RATHER THAN ONCE I GETTING EVERYTHING THAT THEY WANT OTHER SIDE. DID SIGN A CLOSE UP SHOT OF GETTING A SHOPPER GETTING NOTHING SO I THINK YOU AND WITH THAT I MOVE THE BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION AND BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER CALDERON INTO SECOND PLACE ON THE NUMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER. NEXT UP WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ACOSTA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. BOY A LOT LET A GREAT QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED. AND. A YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IN FIRST OF ALL LIKE TO THINK THE CHAIR I'M TO BE THE OUT THE AUTHOR. IN A FOR COVERING BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE TOOK TO THE FOR. AND FRANKLY INVOLVING MY STAFF AND ME AT SUCH A. HIGH LEVEL IN THIS CONVERSATION I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. YOU KNOW I I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THESE EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH INTEREST RATES ARE REALLY CONCERNING AND TO A LOT OF PEOPLE AND. ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE GENERAL FINANCIAL LITERACY THAT WE HAVEN'T SOME SOME OF OUR COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE OFTEN TARGETED BY THESE BODIES PRODUCTS BUT. YELL AT IT THIS POINT UNFORTUNATELY I'M JUST NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL AS IT IS. AND AND I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE HAD. KALRA. AND I'LL I'LL BE LAYING OFF OF THE BILL. AND BUT I DO YOU LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT PROGRESS YOU CAN MAKE BECAUSE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN THIS ISSUE. AND GIVEN THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ASKED HER TO DANCE BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU I'M SURE. I THINK IT'S A MEMBER ACOSTA ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI. I. THINK IT'S CHAIR. AS I LISTEN MORE I GET CONFUSED MORE. NOW ORIGINALLY WHEN. NOW WAS THERE. ASSEMBLYMAN. CORRECTING TO ME IT WAS SO VERY. UNDERSTANDABLE IS SO INTENT WAS SO TO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS HAVE FROM OUR. S. EXTRA ORDINARY HIGH. INTEREST RATES OUT THAT THE TRIPLE DIGIT TO HIT THE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED LEFT IN THE PLACENTA SO OUTRAGEOUS SO. BUT NOW WHEN I HEAR THE OPPOSITE SIDE. THE CONSUMERS SO WE'LL GET HURT AND THAT THEY WOULD HAPPEN YOU KNOW NO PLACE TO GO. AND ALSO OUR HEARING THE THE STAGGERING AMOUNT OF OF WHAT THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION WAGNER SELF FROM ONE I NEED TO SELL. OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE YOU KNOW THE QUAKE NEED A PATH FOR THAT MARKET THAT. AND THOUGH I'M SURE THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER COMPANIES US SO WHEN WE AT ALL ARE OF TO OF SO. KNOW FIGURE SET THAT'S SO A TREMENDOUSLY HIGH MANOBA. YOU KNOW WELL DODDER HAVE BEING IN IT IT IN ALL. A. COLOGNE DOT TO OUR SUCH LEVEL OF. CONSUMERS SIR. WHEN. NIGHT HERE THIRTY SIX PERCENT AND THAT THERE ARE OUT WHAT THE TWENTY ONE ST MAY. STILL I'M NOT CONVINCED. AND THEN ALSO SOME. HOT COMPANIES THAT CAN LEAVE. A WITH THE KEPT THIRTY SIX SET. AND I WONDER WHAT THAT THIRTY SIX PERCENT DOWN. ODD THAT IS SO REALLY VIABLE OR INTEREST RATES THE FOR MANY COMPANIES SET TO OUR. ACCOMMODATE DONE AND DUSTED MAKEUP PROFIT. AND THERE ARE SOME COMPANIES ARE SAYING YES. BUT THERE ARE SOME SALES WE WOULD BE OUT OF THE MARKET. SO WELL WHICH SIDE DISH DOT BELIEVE IN THAT IS SOME MY FRUSTRATION AT THIS TIME. HOW ARE? I SHOULD KNOW WHICH SIDE THE HOUSE EITHER SUPPORT THE WAR WHO ARE. YOU KNOW NOT TO SUPPORT THIS MAIL A I THINK I NEED TO. HAVE US A MORE CONVINCING. DID THE DATA. AT THIS TIME IS UP REALLY. NOT DATA. AND NOT DOES SUBSTANTIALLY YA KNOW CONVINCING ME. ORIGIN ON IT INTENT OF US. THE A. CONSUMER A SUBPOENA. PAYS JUST OUTRAGEOUS OUTRAGEOUSLY CHARGED. BUT THE WAY THAT THIS ARE VERY PEOPLE WILL GET HURT TO. THAT WOULD HAVE NO PLACE TO GO TO. SO IF FAR. IF I CAN ADD MORE ANSWERS TO THAT BUT I THINK I HEARD THEY ENOUGH FOR. AND THE. I DON'T KNOW. BUT I CAN GIVE THE SUPPORT IF THE STOCK. THINK YES ONLY NUMBER CHOI. DECEMBER COVERAGE LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT GUY I WOULD I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA AND FIRST OF ALL AND I KNOW THAT. SAMBAR CHOI BECAUSE YOU EXPRESSED THAT CONCERN ABOUT BUSINESSES AND I THINK GOD REMOVING FIVE TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS HELPS A LOT IN THAT REGARD SOMETHING A LOT OF BUSINESSES THAT'S. AN AREA ESPECIALLY THE BY WESTERN EQUIPMENT WOULD HAVE YOU OF WOULD ALLOW THEM TO STILL. I'M YOU KNOW BUT THAT IT WOULDN'T AND WE WILL FIND AND WORK ON OTHER. ASPECTS CONSUMER PROTECTION IN THAT RANGE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA. THERE ARE QUITE A FEW OF AS I MENTIONED. THE MAJORITY OF THOSE THAT ARE NOT IN THE THIRTY SIX PERCENT GENERAL RANGER LOWER. OUR THEIR INTEREST RATES. ARE OR SEVENTY PERCENT HIGHER SOME ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY HUNDRED PERCENT AND HIGHER. SO. BERNIE I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT THAT. LOOK YOU KNOW. OR YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS THAT WON'T HAVE ACCESS AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE HUNDRED PERCENT TRIPLE DIGIT LOANS BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THOSE THAT AREN'T. IN CONFORMITY AT LEAST IN THE BALLPARK OF CONFORMITY PETER FOR TWO. DOUBLE DIGIT LOANS. BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT THE FARM MAJORITY OF THOSE THAT AREN'T. OF THE FARM MAJORITY LOANS GIVEN THAT AREN'T IN THE A THIRTY SIX PERCENT RANGE THERE'S A BIG GAP ALL OF A SUDDEN. IS I DOUBT BECAUSE EVERYONE DOES GET THIRTY SIX PERCENT ALL OF A SUDDEN CAN'T QUALIFY THAT FIFTY PERCENT OR SIXTY PERCENT OR SEVENTY PERCENT. OR IS THERE A BUSINESS MODEL IN PLACE THAT. THAT IS. FOISTING. HIGHER PERCENTAGES ON FOLKS THAT CAN'T GO ANYWHERE ELSE AND THE END UP IN THE SAME PLACE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THOSE LOANS WERE MADE AVAILABLE TO THEM. BORROWING MONEY FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY GOING TO PAWN SHOPS GOING TO A LIAM SELLING THEIR PROPERTY. TO PAY BACK A LOAN OR THEY'RE GOING TO DEFAULT AND THEY CAN'T GET ANOTHER LOAN AT THE BACK TO THE TO SQUARE ONE. AND SO THE QUESTION AS IS INDICATED IN THE REPORT IS THE PUBLIC THAT THE PRIMARY% PUBLIC POLICY QUESTION RAISED BY THIS BILL. IS AT WHAT POINT THE BENEFITS OF ACCESS TO CAPITAL OUTWEIGHED BY THE COSTS DOES PROVIDING A HIGH COST LOAN TO HOUSEHOLD AND FINANCIAL NEED. DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THE MAJORITY THE TIME IT DOES MORE HARM THAN GOOD. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES. WHAT WE'RE FIRST OFF I WANT I THINK THE CHAIR IN THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING SO DILIGENTLY ON THIS BILL AND BRING IN SOME STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE? THIS IS GONNA HAVE A LIVELY DISCUSSION. AND SINCE WE STARTED COMMITTEE. I DO RECOGNIZE THIS BEING AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. HOWEVER I STILL SEE A LOT OF IMPORTANT DATA THAT'S. IT'S LACKEY AND AS WE'VE HEARD. ON BOTH SIDES. I DO ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE TIME TO FIND A REASONABLE SOLUTION. I'VE SPOKEN TO MANY ON BOTH SIDES WHO ARE IN THIS ROOM. SOME WHO ARE ALSO WILL LEAN. TO FIND A PATH FORWARD. WHICH IS SOMETHING I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. THERE ARE SIX SOME CONCERNS I HAVE ON UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. PERHAPS WHERE CONSUMERS ARE LEAD TO SITUATIONS THAT ARE NOT ECONOMICALLY DESIRABLE. ACCESS. IS A BIG CONCERN. AS WELL. SHOULD THIS BILL. REACH THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR I WILL RE EXAMINE ITS MERITS THAN. HOWEVER I DO WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS ONGOING DISCUSSION BECAUSE IT DOESN'T AND TODAY. WE NEED TO CONTINUE OUR WHATEVER HAPPENS TODAY IN COMMITTEE. BUT I WANT TO ASSURE THAT WE DO STRIKE A BALANCE. I BETWEEN PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND PROVIDING ACCESS AND I BELIEVE MANY ON ON THIS COMMITTEE. MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES TO RECOGNIZE THAT. I STILL WITHOUT THOSE ARE MY THOUGHTS. BUT TIME MEMBER GRAYSON YES REAL QUICK. THE MILITARY NEGOTIATED A THIRTY SIX PERCENT RATE CAP WHAT WHAT'S THE BACKGROUND OF THAT HOW DID THE HOW DID THEY GET TO THIRTY SIX PERCENT AND WHY WAS THAT THE SWEET SPOT FOR MILITARY. THE. THE. THE MILITARY ALLMAN SECULAR HOOK MY NOTES I I KNOW THAT I HAVE MOVING. BUT I DO KNOW THAT THE MILITARY PUT PART OF THE REASON WHY THEY RIDE AT THIRTY SIX PERCENT. IS THAT. THAT IS A WORM. OTHER STATES ALREADY HAD IT AND I THINK THAT THIRD THAT THAT WAS THE AND WE DO HAVE ARTICLES I CAN SEND YOU AS WELL. THAT. THAT THEIR ANALYSIS OF WHAT THOSE OF THOSE STATES BEING AT THIRTY SIX PERCENT FOUND THAT IT BOTH ALLOWED FOR ACCESS TO CREDIT. ABA WHILE PROTECTING THE CONSUMER AND SO I THINK IT REALLY FALLS IN LINE WITH THE ARGUMENT THAT WE'RE MAKING IS THAT. THERE'S A REASON WHY THIRTY SIX PERCENT. OF HAS BECOME A BENCHMARK FOR THESE LOANS AND THERE'S A REASON WHY THE MILITARY ADOPTED. ATTACK THOSE THAT ARE SERVING FOR. ONE THING ABOUT THIRTY SIX PERCENT THAT THE MILITARY ON THE THAT THE MILITARY LENDING ACT REQUIRES. BOB. ADMIRAL AB IT WAS QUOTED NATURAL ALLEN IS THE CEO OF THE NAVY MARINE RELIEF SOCIETY. REAL DATA HERE AFTER THE THIRTY SIX PERCENT WHEN AND. THOUGHT HE WAS HE WAS QUOTED SAYING OVER TRAP PROGRAMS HAVE REPLACED PAYDAY LENDING AS THE LEADING FINANCIAL PROBLEM. FOR MANY MILITARY PERSONNEL. SO IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE ONCE AGAIN THE DOES THE MAN GO AWAY NO THEY SEEK OUT OTHER OPTIONS AND IN THIS CASE A THEY SOUGHT OUT OVERDRAFT. AN OVERDRAFT. CORNING NEW YORK POST I THINK OF THIS WAS AN ARTICLE RECENTLY THIRTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN THE U. S. OVERDRAFT PROTECTION FEES. AND INTERESTINGLY THE MOST THAT'S IT THAT'S INCREASING IS THE COSTA CREDIT UNIONS CREDIT UNIONS ARE INCREASING THEIR OVER TRAP COSTS. A TO CONSUMERS SO ART ARE CONCERNED ONCE AGAIN IS THAT IT IS SHOWN WITH THE MILITARY THERE'S TURNING TO ANOTHER FORM OF LANDING. AND I WOULD IMAGINE A MORE DIFFICULT AND DAMNING FORM OF LENDING USING OVER TRAFFIC A POTENTIALLY PUT YOUR BANK ACCOUNT AT RISK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I DO AS WELL WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE HARD WORK OF THE CHAIR. AND ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE WITH YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF. AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK AS WELL THE VOICES THAT HAVE SPOKEN LE IN SUPPORT AS WELL AS THOSE THAT HAVE COME IN AND. SPOKEN OPPOSITION. THERE ARE VERY PASSIONATE ARGUMENTS AND. STRONG OPINIONS ON EACH SIDE. I KNOW THAT TED. THE ISSUE OF DATA HAS BEEN DISCUSSED. I. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA AYE I DID HEAR YOU START OFF YOUR PRESENTATION WITH. MOVING THE FOR A THE CEILING FROM TEN THOUSAND DOWN TO FIVE THOUSAND. WE'VE HEARD THE DISCUSSION OF CREDIT REPORTING AND HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS BECAUSE I ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT IS A LADDER. AND A WAY TO HELP PEOPLE OUT OF. THEIR DEPENDENCY ON HIGH INTEREST. LOANS AND TO BE ABLE TO GET IN TO THAT. THE THE THE BANKING SYSTEM. THE ORIGINATION FEE. IN MY ESTIMATION I THOUGHT IT WAS SEVEN PERCENT THAT. THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME SOME DISCUSSION THERE THAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE AND THE OTHER THING THAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO ME. IS THAT THERE OUGHT TO BE A MEANS OF PROTECTION. FOR THOSE THAT ARE ENTERING INTO SUCH A HIGH RISK. INDUSTRY OF LOANING. MONEY TO FOLKS WITHOUT CREDIT OR VERY BAD CREDIT AND THERE SHOULD BE A MEANS FOR THEM. TO BE ABLE WELL OUTSIDE OF THE PARAMETER OF A CAP TO BE ABLE TO OUT WILL PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR THEMSELF. BLOOM LOAN INSURANCE. A A COLLEAGUE SAID THAT. THEY WERE VERY ENCOURAGED AND APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR HARD WORK. AND HOW THAT IT WAS. IMPORTANT THAT THE CONVERSATION CONTINUE. AND THAT. MY COLLEAGUE WAS VERY SUPPORTIVE AND WANTED THAT. CONVERSATION TO CONTINUE THE ONLY WAY THAT CONVERSATION CONTINUES IS IF THIS BILL GETS OUT OF THE COMMITTEE OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST. KILL IT RIGHT HERE AND THEN THERE'S NO CONVERSATION I WAS FACED WITH THE SITUATION LAST YEAR. IN A COMMITTEE OF A VERY. OF HARD CONTROVERSIAL BILL THAT I WOULD CONSIDER LIKE INTO THIS ONE. AND THE THE THE THING THAT I THOUGHT WAS THE WISEST TO DO WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALLOWED BOTH SIDES TO CONTINUE TO WORK AND BECAUSE YOU HAVE MADE. SOME TREMENDOUS MOVEMENT. ESPECIALLY TODAY IN OUR TALKS. YOU HAVE SHOWN TO ME THAT THERE WAS SOME GOOD FAITH ON YOUR PART. I JUST. I WILL I WILL HAVE THE THEM I WILL. HAVE THE BENEFIT AND RESERVATION. THAT IF THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS THESE KIND OF THINGS IF IT GETS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND THE CONVERSATIONS DON'T TAKE PLACE THAT NEED TO TAKE PLACE THAN I I WOULD. RESERVE THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO NOT SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT MAY END UP ON THE FLOOR. SO. HAVING SAID THAT. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER. YES. WANT TO THANK YOU ALSO KNOW YOU PUT A LOT OF HARD WORK INTO THIS BILL YOU AS WELL AS THE CHAIR COMING INTO THIS POSITION NEW OF FACING THIS. PROBLEM. AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT SORRY I WAS LATE I WAS TEARING THE BUDGET COMMITTEE SO WE JUST FINISHED. SUMMER YOU BASSAM SOME CRITICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS BILL AND JUST LET ME SAY THIS THAT FIVE YEARS AGO. YOU MAY HAVE BEEN ON IT WITH ME TOO I'M NOT SURE IF IAN WAS ON THE BANKING COMMITTEE FIVE YEARS AGO I WAS ON THIS COMMITTEE. AND ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL THINGS CAME UP WITH THIS SO IT'S NOT AN OLD NEW TOPIC IT'S A RATHER OLD TOP ACUTE THE CAPITAL THE KIND OF GOALS IN CIRCLES. WITH DATA AND INFORMATION AND ALWAYS WITH THE THREAT THAT PEOPLE WILL ALL THESE THINGS WILL GO AWAY. AND. I CAN'T REMEMBER THE OUTCOME OF IT BUT OBVIOUSLY WE DIDN'T PASS THE BILL AT LEAST WE DID NOT THE FLOOR SOMETHING HAPPEN. BUT I THINK THE CONVERSATION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND IT IS SPECIALLY IF YOU COMMUNITIES I HAVE A. A DISTRICT THAT HAS A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING IN IT YOU KNOW WERE AFFLUENT COMMUNITIES WE HAVE LOTS OF RESOURCES AND WHAT HAVE YOU. AND I ALSO HAVE THE HEART OF SAN DIEGO OF RIGHT NEXT TO LORRAINE IS DISTRICT WHERE. OF WHAT WE HAVE THESE CHALLENGES AND THE THING I'VE NOTICED MORE RECENTLY TO SEE IT IS EASIER TO GET. TO A PAYDAY LOAN OR OR A CARLENE PLACE THAN IT IS TO GET TO A BANK. THERE ARE VERY FEW BANKS IN AND CREDIT UNIONS IMPORT COMMUNITIES SO ALMOST NO CREDIT UNIONS BUT THEY ARE SURELY VERY VERY FEW BANKS IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND THE FACT THAT I CAN THINK OF. TO A THREE FACILITIES RIGHT NOW ON MY DISTRICT WITH A ONCE FOR BANKS ANOTHER CAR LOAN PLACES. OF THE SO THE BANKING IS GONE ALMOST IN POOR COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S UNFORTUNATE. BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT JUST THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO KNOW A BANK AND TO BE A PART OF IT AND SAVE A LITTLE MONEY AND YOU KNOW DEVELOP SOME RELATIONSHIP THAT PEOPLE USED TO DEVELOPMENT BANKS. DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE SO NOW OUR OUR COMMUNITIES ARE LEFT TO THIS AS THE OPTION. AND EITHER SOMEONE DIES YOU GOT A PROBLEM EITHER THEM GOLD OVER THERE AND DO THAT OR YOU DON'T HAVE A CAR WATCH THIS SPECIALTY NOW AND POOR COMMUNITIES AT CAR WASHES THE FUNERALS OKAY. BUT THAT'S BEEN INNOVATIVE I MEAN AT LEAST YOU DON'T UP AND DID YOU KNOW YOU. WE MAY WATCH A WHOLE BUNCH OF CARS AND DELAY THE FUNERAL BUT PEOPLE HE'D YOU DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO. SO I THINK THIS CONVERSATION IS IMPORTANT AND IT HAS TO GO FORWARD THAT YOU KNOW THE IDEA THAT. THE PEOPLE ARE HEARING A HUNDRED AND SOME ODD PERCENT OF TOUR OF FOR SOME COMPANY REMINDS ME OF WHAT FOLKS TALK BACK IN THE IN THE THIRTIES AND FORTIES ABOUT LOAN SHARKS IN COMMUNITIES AND. LENDING MONEY AND YOU KNOW YOU HAD BEHIND PERCENT RIGHT AWAY AND AND THEN THE FACT THAT OTHER THINGS HAPPEN TO PEOPLE OF THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL. AND I KNOW YOU KNOW HAVING LIVED ALL MY LIFE AND POOR COMMUNITIES IN A THAT. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THOSE HOLES ARE SO DEEP. UNLESS YOU HAVE A RELATIVE WHO CAN FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW YOU JUST YOU JUST KEEP GOING ANY GOALS AND IT GOES IN AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE. OF THAT IMPACTS FAMILIES IN THE WAY THAT IT DOES SO I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE I KNOW YOU GOT ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES THAT OF THE AND WE ALWAYS SERVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TOOK TO PULL BACK BUT I THINK THE CONVERSATION IS IMPORTANT AND WHEN FOLKS THAT I THINK THIS HAS BEEN HERE BEFORE YESTERDAY AS I KNOW WAS HERE. IN IN TWENTY THIRTEEN BECAUSE I WAS ON THE COMMITTEE AND TWENTY THIRTEEN WE HAVE AND YOU MAY HAVE BEEN YOU TO YES A. IN THE CONVERSATION AT TWENTY THIRTEEN SO THIS IS IT THIS IS A SUBJECT THAT'S GONE AROUND AND AROUND AND WE HAVE TO FACE IT. THAT IS AN INDUSTRY HERE AND NO INDUSTRY LIKES REGULATION I HAVE IT AT AS I STUDIED HISTORY. A I DON'T KNOW INDUSTRYYET BUT LIKE RIGID REGULATION THE LABOR INDUSTRY DIDN'T LET ME LIKE REGULATION BUT THOUGH THE A PRIVATE ENTRY DID WHEN HE CAME TO. BASICALLY ALL YOUTH WORKERS CHILD LABOR NOBODY LIKE REGULATIONS NOBODY LIKES TO BE SAID YOU HAVE TO DO THIS VERSUS THAT BANKS DON'T EVEN REALLY LIKE REGULATION THEY'VE LEARNED TO LIVE WITH THAT. AND WHEN WE DEREGULATE THAT WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED SO WE NO ONE LIKES REGULATION AND ESTIMATE AND AS LONG AS YOU'RE ABLE TO OPERATE WITHOUT IT YOU WILL OKAY. ARE IF YOU HAVE REGULATION THINGS OFTENTIMES BUSINESS FIGURE OUT HOW TO WORK WITHIN THE REGULATIONS. AND I THINK WE SHOULD TRY TO MAKE THE REGULATIONS REASONABLE SO THAT THAT THE BUSINESSES KID WHO CHOOSE TO REMAIN CAN'T SURVIVE. BUT IT'S IT SEEMS ALWAYS UNREASONABLE TO ME THAT. I CAN ONLY GET SOMETHING IF I JUST HAVE IT IF SOMEBODY'S HOLDING OVER MY HEAD HAVE TO PAY THOSE ZILLION DOLLARS TO GET THIS BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY WON'T GIVE IT TO ME. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S YOU AND WE HEAR THAT SO OFTEN IN POOR COMMUNITIES WHERE RESOURCES ARE SO LIMITED THAT WE BROUGHT YOU FRESH VEGETABLES INSTEAD OF THE ALL VEGETABLES YOU LATE COST YOU SO MUCH MORE. AND YOU WONDER WHY IS AN ORANGE IN MY COMMUNITY SO EXPENSIVE. WAS IT A SPECIAL TRUCK A LIMO A ROLLS ROYCE THAT BROUGHT IT IF NO IT WAS BROUGHT IN FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT WAS OLD AND SO. OFTEN TIMES ARE FIGHTING THESE BATTLES THAT WE THINK WE SHOULD HAVE TO FIGHT WITH PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TIME TO FIGHT THEM THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO. THEY DON'T HAVE THE THE THE THE SPIRIT ANYMORE JUST TO FIGHT THE INSTITUTIONS THAT COULD POSSIBLY BRING THEM SOMETHING SO. SO I I APPRECIATE OF MY COLLEAGUE GO. THE FROM SAN JOSE. TAKEN THIS AS A ISSUE NAY HAS SINCE HE'S BEEN HERE AND FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT OUGHT I APPRECIATE MY NEW CHAIR WHO'S WHO'S STANDING THERE WITH THE MEN AND I ASKED THE REST OF US TO HAVE SOME FAITH IN THE FACT. pTHAT IF WE IF WE BECOME REASONABLE AND REGULATE THIS THAT IT WILL STILL SERVE A VERY IMPORTANT PURPOSE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT WILL BE FAIR TO FOLKS WHO ARE STRUGGLING THE MOST IT'S ALMOST LIKE WHEN YOU ON THE BOTTOM SUBMITTED TO STEPS ON YOU KNOW. AND AND AND AND THAT NONE OF US WOULD TAKE OUT ANYTHING THERE'S A HUNDRED AND SOME ODD PERCENT ALONE I MEAN THAT WOULD JUST BE WE THINK WE'VE LOST OUR MIND WE STRUGGLE AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO SOME OF THE WAY. BUT THAT'S BECAUSE WE SEE OURSELVES WITH OPTIONS AND RESOURCES AND SOMETIMES THOSE COMMUNITIES DON'T SEE IT AND SOME AND WE HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME LEVEL OF SUPPORT OR COVER FOR THEM IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT THE INDUSTRY. UGH REGULATES ITSELF UP BUT THAT WE PARTICIPATE IN THAT REGULATION AND PUTS THEM CAPS AND LIMITS ON. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER AYE I THINK THAT THIS HAS BEEN A VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION I THINK THAT THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS INVESTED. I WOULD AGREE THAT THE COMMITTEE AT TEAM HAS BEEN INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THIS DISCUSSION IS REFLECTIVE OF HOW IMPORTANT THIS CONVERSATION IS. IT HAS BEEN NOTED OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT THIS IS A HISTORICAL CONVERSATION IT DIDN'T COME UP LAST YEAR IT DIDN'T COME UP FIVE YEARS AGO IT DID COME UP TEN YEARS AGO. AND SO WHEN THIS COMMITTEE STARTED THINKING ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR BILL WE ACTUALLY WENT TO HISTORY WE WENT TO WHEN THE FIRST THAT KIND OF LAWS WERE PASSED THE LOUD. OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS AND WE THOUGHT TO OURSELVES WHAT WAS THE GENESIS AROUND THAT WHAT WAS THE THINKING ON AND IT WAS AND RECOGNITION THAT OUR COMMUNITIES DO INDEED HAVE LIMITED ACCESS. AND WE BELIEVE THAT I BELIEVE THAT I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO I'VE WORKED WITH IN THE COMMUNITY I REPRESENT AND ALL THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA THAT DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WALK INTO A BANK THAT DON'T HAVE A RELATIVE WHO CAN GIVE THEM ALONE ON THE SPOT. I BELIEVE THAT AND. WE BELIEVE I THINK IS A COMMITTEE THAT THAT'S WHERE THIS CAME FROM FROM UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT WAS A TRUE ISSUE ON IN OUR COMMUNITY BUT I WANT TO QUOTE ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO SAID THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO STRIKE THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN ACCESS. AND PROTECTING CONSUMERS. AND I THINK THAT THIS IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT. UP. YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE WE'VE STUDIED THE ISSUE SEVERAL FOLKS HAVE TALKED TO WES I AM AND I WAS HANDED A VERY USEFUL ARTICLE ABOUT SOUTH DAKOTA. AND WHAT HAPPENED WHEN SOUTH DAKOTA KIND OF WENT TO THIS. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT A RED STATE VOTED. CAP THEMSELVES ON THIS ISSUE. AND SO WHEN I THINK ABOUT THAT I THINK ABOUT WHAT IT DID ENSURE THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES AND I HOPE THAT THOSE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE WILL HAVE SHOULD THIS BILL MOVED FORWARD. ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS. BUT THE PUBLIC WANTS THIS AND IF THE RED CONSERVATIVE STATE LIKE SOUTH DAKOTA. ON WANTS THIS I ALSO THINK THAT I WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO LEAD THE CONVERSATION HERE. IF THIS CONVERSATION WENT TO THE BALLOT. WHICH IS GOOD BECAUSE WE ARE STATE THAT LIKE A LOT ABOUT ENOUGH FOR THEM AND EATEN IT WOULD GO IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND THOSE OF US WHO HAVE THAT INVESTED HOURS AND HOURS EXPERTS. ON BOTH SIDES OPPOSITION INCLUDED WOULD NOT HAVE THE SAME LEVEL OF OPPORTUNITY AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US AYE TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION. I'M REALLY. YOU KNOW I I I LOW I AM OPEN AND I'M. AND I. WANT TO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE WHAT I'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT YOU ARE INTERESTED IN WORKING ON THIS. AND I THINK YOU BRING A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE THAT IS IMPORTANT TO THE TABLE I THINK IT'S ONE THAT PROVIDES VALUE TO US AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD IN THIS. A AND AND I HOPE YOU WILL BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO FORMER BILLS THAT. WORK IN A SPACE THAT. REQUIRES US TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE WHEN PEOPLE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A BANK AND SO I HOPE THAT THAT'S ON A GENUINE INTEREST I FEEL LIKE THERE HAS BEEN A. CONVERSATION THAT HAPPENED INDIVIDUALLY IN SMALL GROUPS WE HAD A STAKEHOLDER MEETING LAST WEEK AND IT IS A OUR INTERESTS TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS THE COMMITTEE TO ENGAGE IN DIFFERENT WAYS. TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE HAVE THIS I IT IS ALSO MY BELIEF AS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT IF THIS CONVERSATION. IF THIS PARTICULAR BILL DOESN'T MOVE FORWARD TODAY IT IS NOT THE END OF THE CONVERSATION. THIS BILL FOR THIS IDEA WILL COME BACK BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT HISTORY HAS SHOWN US. AND SO I THINK IT'S AND I HOPE THAT ALL OF THOSE AT THE TABLE WILL REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW WE MOVE IT FORWARD. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA I'M ENCOURAGED BY THE FACT THAT YOU ARE OPEN TO CONSIDERING THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS IN ADDITION. I AM I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT YOU ARE REMOVING THE CAP FROM FIVE TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THAT THERE IS IN A. AN ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION OF EXPLORING CREDIT REPORTING IN THIS. SCRIPT. ALRIGHT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I WOULD OF NEW REALLY. YOU KNOW FIRST LARGELY ONE OF THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I THINK YOUR LEADERSHIP HAS BEEN EXEMPLARY. AND LIKE I COULDN'T ASK FOR A BETTER CHAIR TAP NEGOTIATE THIS VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE WITH SUB I'M VERY GRATEFUL. TO YOU ARE I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHETHER. YOU'RE PREPARED TO VOTE. UP OR DOWN ON THIS I THE WAY YOU GIVE ME THE RESPECT AND THE TIME IN THE COURTESY AND GENEROSITY UNDER CONSIDERATION AND THAT'S EXTREMELY. MEANINGFUL TO ME AYE WE DEAL WITH A LOT OF ISSUES AND WE CAN HAVE. CONVERSATIONS ABOUT OF ONE ANOTHER WE CAN'T DIALOGUE OTHER I THINK IT DIMINISHES ALL OF US AND DIMINISHES. OF THE ASSEMBLY AS A WHOLE. AND YOU KNOW I I PUT. WOULD START STARTING WITH THE JUST BUT WITH THE SUMMER GRAYSON AYE YES. TO ALL YOUR POINTS. THOSE ARE ISSUES THAT AS WE HAD. DURING THE COMMITTEE HEARING THEY ALL CAME UP IN DIFFERENT FORMS. AND ABSOLUTELY. YOU KNOW THE DOOR CONTINUES TO BE OPEN WE HAVE HAD A NUMBER. OF OF INDUSTRY. MEMBERS REPRESENTATIVES MEET WITH ME MEET WITH MUCH OF A STAFF MEET WITH THE. OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND I IMAGINE THAT THAT'S IS GOING TO CONTINUE GOING FOR I HOPE IT DOES. CONTINUE GOING FORWARD. I ALSO HAVE CONCERNS OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND ACCESS. AND AND. IT'S REAL HARM A A BUT I THINK THAT AS THE CHAIR PUT IT. A SOMBER ALDERON PUT AND OTHERS IT IS ABOUT FINDING THAT BALANCE IT'S ABOUT HOW WE DO IT THE RIGHT WAY. AND IT'S NOT EASY AND IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE EASY. OF THEM MAYBE LIKE TOO DIFFICULT THINGS BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE BECAUSE IT ISN'T EASY BECAUSE OF SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE DO. NEED TO ADDRESS DE AND. I'LL JUST TERM. WITH THE DOCTOR WEBER IS THE. INSPIRATION FINISH BY SAYING LOOK YOU KNOW. A LOT OF US WERE DIFFERENT DANCEABLE BEACON THIS MORNING HOUSES SAN JOSE AT OUR SITTER JOBS BREAKFAST. AND. XENA CHAVEZ FIRST ORGANIZING SAN JOSE NAY BECAUSE ALSO PLAY THIS GET OUT IF YOU CAN. OF ROUGH STORY ROAD NEAR STARRING KING. I THINK THAT. HE YOU. IT WOULD BE VERY DISAPPOINTED IF HE SAW. CONDITION THAT NEIGHBORHOOD NOW WHICH THAT HAS THE POOREST CENSUS TRACTS IN THE SMOKING VALLEY. WHERE YOU HAVE LIQUOR STORES A CONVENIENCE STORES AND PSYCHOSIS STORES? WHERE YOU HAVE CHECK IT CATCHES A PAVE UNDER SOME SORT OF TRADITIONAL? RATHER THAN SIT DOWN RESTAURANTS FOR FARMERS MARKETS. THAT'S A FAILURE OF OURS. THE FAILURE. OF BATTLEMENT. WHEN YOU ALLOW NEIGHBORHOODS TO FALL INTO THAT LEVEL OF DISREPAIR. I AM WILLING TO AND COMMIT TO WORKING WITH ANYONE THAT WANTS US TO UPLIFT THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS UP THOSE THOSE FAMILIES. GIVE THEM ACCESS TO REAL CREDIT AND REAL FINANCIAL OPPORTUNITY. SO THAT BECAUSE TO A STOP THIS DOWNWARD SPIRAL IN SO MANY OF OUR NEIGHBORHOODS THAT I HEARD FROM ALL OF YOU THIS AFTERNOON.

THANK YOU SO MUCH ASSIGNMENTS AND PLEASE MY PLEASURE FOR SITES JUST HOPE EVERYONE HAS GOTTEN ALL THOSE. WONDERFUL QUESTIONS EITHER WAY. NICE SIMPLE BILL PRESS TO FINISH THE DAY WITH BUT I I JUST WANTED THINK THAT MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR BEING HERE TODAY. I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN EIGHTY ONE WHICH WILL PREVENT BUSINESS OWNERS PERSONAL AND SENSITIVE INFORMATION FROM BEING EASILY ACCESSIBLE ONLINE. TODAY STATEMENTS OF INFORMATION FILE BY CORPORATIONS AND LLC'S CAN BE VIEWED ONLINE BY IT IN INDIVIDUAL WITH INTERNET ACCESS. ALTHOUGH ALLOWING THE PUBLIC TO REVIEW THESE BUSINESSES FILINGS ONLINE DOES IMPROVE GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY AND EFFICIENCY SOME OF THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE FILINGS CAN BE SUBSTANTIALLY IN EASILY MISUSED. THE PERSON. FILINGS CAN QUICKLY BE PULLED FROM THE DOCUMENT AND YOU. INCLUDING CHECKS. THE RESIDENTIAL ADDRESSES PROVIDE BY SOME BUSINESS OWNERS CAN BE USED TO FIND IMAGES IN THE EXACT LOCATION OF AN OWNER'S PERSONAL HOME. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY ONE WOULD PROVIDE A MODEST SOLUTION BY REDACTING RESIDENTIAL ADDRESSES AND PERSONAL SIGNATURES FROM ALL FUTURE BUSINESS FILINGS POSTED ON THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S ON MY DATABASE. ADDITIONALLY THE FULL UNALTERED FILINGS WOULD STILL BE AVAILABLE UPON REQUEST THIS BILL STRIKES A BALANCE BETWEEN PROTECTING BUSINESS OWNERS PERSONAL PIPE AND PRIVATE INFORMATION. AND PROVIDING NECESSARY DISCLOSURE TO THE PUBLIC I'M I PERSONALLY RECENTLY UNDERWENT A A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE I'M FIGHTING WITH MY BANK WHERE SOME WAS ABLE TO LIFT MY ADDRESS AND MY SIGNATURE AND. GO AHEAD AND AND DEPOSIT AN EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLAR CHECK FOR MY BUSINESS INTO A WELLS FARGO ACCOUNT AND DEALING WITH THAT TODAY. ACTUALLY TODAY SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS REGULARLY GOING ON IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR BUSINESSES SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE BUT BEFORE THAT IF SARAH BOOT FROM THE CAL CHAMBER LIKE TO TESTIFY. SECOND. RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. AND THIS THIS BILL DOES HAVE AN AYE AYE RECOMMENDATION. SO WE WILL CALL THE ROLL SINCE WE HAVE A MOTION. NO. I GUESS I'M A IS I'M SORRY. SOME. I UNDERSTAND THE SIGNATURE ASPECT BUT. WHERE IS THIS AVAILABLE FOR THE PUBLIC TO ACCESO SAY? NO OFFENSE BUT THEY WANT TO SUE YOU BECAUSE YOU. DID SOMETHING WRONG TO ME AS A BUSINESS WHERE DO I FIND THAT WELL YOU CAN GO CURRENTLY IT'S ONLINE YOU CAN GO TO SENATOR ANNOUNCED WEBSITE AFTER THIS RIGHT AFTER THIS IT STILL WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE THAT WOULD LIKE TO GO IN AND RECEIVE IT FROM. BOOK. PLEASE DUMP AND IF I MAY. MADAM CHAIR OF. MAX. THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE. THE ONLINE ACCESS TO CORPORATIONS DESIGNATED AGENT FOR SERVICE OF PROCESS WHATSOEVER. WITH A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. ACTION OF THE LOT THIS BILL THE THING BACK THAT. I'M I'M. IT IT IT FROM MY UNDERSTAND SECRETARY STATE ARE EACH HOUSE BUSINESSES ARE. RECOMMENDS BUSINESSES NOT TO USE THEIR HOME ADDRESS. WELL ACTUALLY. SPECIFICALLY CALLS OUT FOR YOU TO PUT IN YOUR HOME ADDRESS. ON THE FORM. OKAY THAT'S NOT INFORMATION OFTEN SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE SO EVERYBODY'S HOME ADDRESS IS ON THE THE FORM THE OWNERS OF THE CORPORATION. IT ASKS YOU TO LIST WHAT YOUR PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP. AND ALSO YOUR ADDRESS. HATE THAT THE SACRED AYE I'M GONNA STAY OFF THIS BILL TODAY THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE HAS A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THIS BILL DOES FROM MY UNDERSTANDING OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL. MY CONCERN IS QUITE FRANKLY IF THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE IT'S A LOT LIKE WHAT WE HAVE TO DO ON. FAR FAR LICENSES WHILE YOU CAN PUT YOUR HOME ADDRESS IN BE A MEMBER THE BAR IN YOUR HOME ADDRESS IS NOW ON OF PUBLIC WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN PUT ANOTHER ADDRESS WHERE PEOPLE CAN CONTACT YOU. AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE ALREADY RECOMMENDS FOR FOLKS NOT BUT THE RESIDENTS IF THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON I I'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE AS THIS MAY BE MOVES THROUGH. SO THAT WERE ALL KIND OF TALKING ABOUT THE SAME ISSUE I THINK IT WOULD BE AYE. RATHER EXPENSIVE OR CREATE ADDITIONAL. CONCERNS FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE UNDERSTAND WHEN PEOPLE ARE FILING A RESIDENTIAL ADDRESS VERSES A BUSINESS ADDRESS AND IN TO TO. PUT THEM IN THE THE POSITION OF HAVING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT A BUSINESSES USING THE RESIDENTS AS THEIR BUSINESS LIKE ADDRESS WHICH I THINK IS MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL OF WHAT. WOULD BE BLACKED OUT SO WE WE SHOULD HAVE SOME MORE DISCUSSION TO STAY OFF OF IT TODAY BUT THANK YOU FOR. I THINK WE WE UNDERSTAND THE BILL DIFFERENTLY ANSWER BILL SO MAYBE BRIGHT WELL SO SO MY DO ANY BETTER BECAUSE I HAVE TO FILL THIS FORM OUT EVERY YEAR EVERY YEAR WE HAVE TO SUBMIT IT AND IT DOES ASK FOR THE. ACTUAL BUSINESS ADDRESS IN THE NASS FOR THE OWNERS AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF OWNERSHIP YOU HAVE IN THE CORPORATION WHETHER IT'S AN LLC SUBCHAPTER RATS OR SEE COURT. AND THAT'LL LAST FOR YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND YOUR PERSONAL SIGNATURE SO ALL OF THAT IS READILY AVAILABLE IN A PDF ONLINE RIGHT NOW WE CAN ALL LOOK UP LIKE FOR EXAMPLE I THINK WE LOOKED UP DAVID HADLEY'S AND SENT IT OFF. TO SHOW WHAT YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN JUST EASILY PULL ITS INFORMATION IN A FIGHT WHERE SOMEONE LIVES AND SEE THEIR PERSONAL SIGNATURE AND WITH ALL THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW WITH MAIL. THEFT AND IDENTITY THEFT IN ALL OF THINGS GOING ON THAT JUST SEEMS LIKE WAY TOO INVASIVE TO BE ONLINE. SO WE WERE JUST GETTING CLARIFICATION THAT AND THAT THAT% IS THE PRACTICE OF BUT THE SECRETARY OF STATE. DOES SAY THAT THE ENCOURAGE A DIFFERENT ADDRESS THEY REQUIRE THE SIGNATURE ON AND I THINK THAT THE ANALYSIS TRIES TO MENTION THAT THAT MEANT THAT. PRACTICES TO PUT THE. THE ADDRESS. AND I UNDERSTAND THE SIGNATURE OF NO PROM WITH IT'S IT'S A. ACCESSIBLE ADDRESS THAT I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DISCUSS FURTHER. AS A MEMBER STUNT. THANK YOU ALONG SIMILAR LINES CAN YOU QUANTIFY. THIS ISSUE HOW OFTEN DOES THIS HAPPEN. NO I DON'T I DON'T HAVE THE DATA TO KNOW THAT I WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIND OUT THAT I KNOW THAT WE HAVE SEEN A SPIKE DRAMATICALLY AND. AND PROPERTY CRIME WE'VE SEEN A SPECTER MEDICALLY AND THEN MAIL THEFT WITHOUT A SPIKE DRAMATICALLY IN A LOT OF THESE AT ITS MARTELL WHEN YOU'RE COMING OFF OF THE RIGHT ONE AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S NOT RELEVANT BECAUSE YET THAT'S. THE QUESTION IS OFF OF THIS FORM AND. HOW OFTEN THIS IS? HAS BEEN AN ISSUE OF. RESPECT AFFECT THE THAT YOU'VE SEEN AN ISSUE WITH THIS I DON'T I DON'T A LOT OF THESE FORMS FOR. CLIENTS I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY WHO PUTS A THEIR HOME RESIDENTS. ON THEIR CORPORATE FILINGS THERE WAS PUT BUSINESS I DO SIGN THE FORM CRACKED THE DO SIGN THE FORM. BUT. HAVE YOU WORKED WITH SECRETARY STATES OFFICE TO IDENTIFY THIS ISSUE AND. AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY THEY THINK AN APPROPRIATE REMEDY WOULD BE WELL WE'VE JUST HEARD TESTIMONY THAT PUTTING A A PO BOX OR A ALTERNATE ADDRESS WOULD BE AWAY A WORKAROUND AROUND THAT. BUT CERTAINLY STILL DOESN'T ELIMINATE THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE WITH PUTTING A PERSONAL SIGNATURE. ON THE FORM ITSELF AND HAVING THAT YOU KNOW ACTUAL VIRTUAL SIGNATURE THERE FOR ANYBODY TO TO HELP THEMSELVES TO AND I THINK THAT EVEN IF WE DON'T I DON'T HAVE DATA SPECIFICALLY SAYS HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE. SEEN FAST EXACTLY FROM THIS FORM I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY CAN QUANTIFY IT EXACTLY TO THAT POINT BUT YOU KNOW TO MY EXAMPLE I MEAN IT'S IT'S SOMETHING THAT OCCURRED JUST. RECENTLY AND IT'S YOU KNOW THEY WERE ABLE TO GET THE ADDRESS GET THE INFORMATION ALL OF THAT WHETHER CAME FROM THAT FORM SPECIFICALLY I DON'T KNOW. BUT CERTAINLY IT'S A QUITE AN INCONVENIENCE DOT TO SHUT DOWN A BANK ACCOUNT MAKE SURE YOU GO TRYING GET THE MONEY GO WORK WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WORK WITH THAT. EUROPE I'VE CHEFS DEPARTMENT MY POLICE DEPARTMENT THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT GOES INTO THAT IT SEEMS VERY SIMPLE REMEDY TO JUST IF YOU'RE GOING TO REDACTED ADDRESS OR REDACTED SIGNATURE TO REDACT THAT ADDRESSES WHILE. BUT BUT SO YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT WAS THIS FORM THAT. NO LED TO MY DEAR YOU HAVE CONTENTS I DON'T KNOW BUT I DO KNOW THAT I FEEL VERY VULNERABLE AND EXPOSED HAVING MY PERSONAL INFORMATION MY SIGNATURE AVAILABLE FOR ANYBODY THAT USES TO GO LOOK IT UP RIGHT THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S WEBSITE NOW I. WRITE I GET THAT BUT I WORRY THAT THIS IS A. PRESCRIPTIVE. BILL AND. TO SOLVE A PROBLEM THAT I'M NOT SURE HOW BROAD THAT PROBLEM IS I'M NOT EVEN SURE. THAT THIS FORMS IS PRETTY EASY FIGHT ALL OF OUR ADDRESSES IF SOMEBODY REALLY WANTS TO. THAT THAT'S NOT A HARD THING TO DO. AND. SO. PUTTING THIS REQUIREMENT ON THE SECRETARY STATE WITHOUT HAVING TALKED TO SECRETARY OF STATE WITHOUT REALLY EVEN KNOWING IF. THERE'S A PROBLEM HERE. I'M KIND OF STRUGGLING WITH ON THIS. WELL I I WOULD I WOULD SUGGEST I'M WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR DIGITAL SIGNATURES COULD YOU MENTIONED ALL OF US IN BEING ABLE TO FIND ALL OF OUR DRESSES. WHEN WE SEND OUT CERTIFICATES I DON'T KNOW THAT ALL OF US USE OUR ACTUAL SIGNATURES ON ALL OF THOSE CERTIFICATES BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID OF IDENTITY THEFT ARE USING OUR OWN SIGNATURES. YEAH INAPPROPRIATELY AND AS FAR AS OUR OWN PERSONAL ADDRESSES WE CHOOSE TO BE ELECTED OFFICIALS SO WE PUT OURSELVES OUT THERE IS ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PUBLIC BUSINESS OWNERS HAVING ALL OF THIS INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR PRIVATE. PRIVACY EXPOSED THE WAY THAT IT IS CURRENTLY MAYFIELD'S UNNECESSARY FEELS LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE THAT LEVEL OF OUR PROTECTION PROVIDED TO THEM BY THEIR OWN GOVERNMENT THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING INFORMATION TO. WHAT MEMBERS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS? RIGHT NOW CNN I WILL. HOW THE SECRETARY CULTURAL? AND I'LL SEE THE MOTION BEFORE THE MOTION IS I DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS. AB SEVENTY EIGHTY ONE. DO PASSED COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. LAMONT BY LIMON I. CHEN. CHEN AYE ACOSTA. ACOSTA AYE BURKE. CALDERON. CALDERON AYE CERVANTES. SAMANTHA SIGH CHOI AYE. CHOI AYE. GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GRAYSON. GRAYSON AYE. STONE. STONE NO. WEBER. WEBER I. BUT THE BILL IS OUT TO APPROPRIATIONS WITH AM EIGHT TO ONE. THINKING I LEFT. ALRIGHT AND NOW I WILL HAND OVER. THE MEETING TO THE MEASURE MADAM CHAIR TO PLEASURE. I THINK A VICE CHAIR I THINK YOU AND MEMBERS UPON ACCEPTING AND MY NEW ROLE AS CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE I HAVE HEARD A COMMON REFRAIN FROM FELLOW MEMBERS. CONSUMER ADVOCATES REGULATORS RESPONSIBLE LENDERS AND THE MEDIA. SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT SMALL DOLLAR CONSUMER LOANS IN CALIFORNIA. THINK. THANK YOU. AT TODAY I AM PRESENTING AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY FUTURE JUST HAD ALONG ONE OF THE RISKIEST AREAS IN THE SMALL DOLLAR LOANS SPACE. I HAVE WITH ME AT TODAY I HEAR A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE THAT IS GOING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT THE. EACH YEAR AND AND THANK YOU ICE CHAIR PLAN FOR HOLDING US AND. NO MEMBERS THIS COMMITTEE. I FIRST I'M GOING TO APOLOGIZE BECAUSE. AND BE LATE FOR DINNER WITH MY MOM I HAVE TO GIVE AN EXCUSE. AND SUMMIT TAKE ITSELF FEET AND THE STATE OF MIND. GOOD EXCUSE. HAD HERE ON COMMITTEE TESTIFYING AND. YOU KNOW. ARE TO BE A GOOD SIGN SO. HI MOM. THAT'S SAID NEVER A DULL MOMENT. WHAT OR WHO? EVERY FEW BECAUSE OF I THREE THINK. I APPRECIATE YOUR DISCRETION VICE CHAIR AND SO MANY WITH TEDDY KING NAM MILLER AND I AND THE ECONOMIC EQUITY DIRECTOR FOR THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE A GREEN MINING IS THE SOLUTION TO REDLINING. AND WE ADVANCE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE COLOR THROUGH ADVOCACY AND COMMUNITY AND COALITION BUILDING RESEARCH AND LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT. OUR MISSION IS TO CLOSE THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP AND THE CREATION OF RESPONSIBLE FAIR ENOUGH FOR BELINDA PRODUCTS IS CRITICAL TO WEALTH CREATION AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY THREE IS ONE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BECAUSE IT ELIMINATES THE PRACTICE OF CHARGING TRIPLE DIGIT INTEREST RATES ON CONSUMER LOANS THAT REQUIRE CONSUMERS TO PLEDGE THEIR VEHICLES OF SECURITY ON THE LEFT. THE OUT HAD A LITTLE PRODUCT IS AMONG MOST PREDATORY FINANCIAL PRODUCTS CURRENTLY PERMITTED INSIDE CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO THE DB ó IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ADULT TITLE LENDERS CONDUCTED OVER TWENTY THOUSAND REPOSSESSIONS. COMPARED TO HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHTY LOANS ORIGINATED THAT YEAR. SUGGESTION THAT ALMOST ONE IN FIVE AUTO BORROWS LOST THEIR VEHICLE. NEARLY SIXTY PERCENT OF ALL TITLE LOANS AT INTEREST RATES EXCEEDING HUNT PERCENT APR. AN ADDITIONAL ONE THIRD OF LOANS OF AN INTEREST RATE ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT PR. THESE EXORBITANT INTEREST RATES COUPLED WITH LENDERS FAILURE TO KIDS CONFIRM BORROWS ABILITY REPAID WITH HIGH RATES OF DEFAULTS AND SUBSEQUENTLY. VEHICLE REPOSSESSIONS. NOT THE FEDERAL LEVEL I WITH THAT TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S AGENDA TO DISMANTLE. BUT THE REGULATORY STATE OF THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU'S ABILITY TO RATE AND ABUSIVE PRACTICES IN OUT OF THAILAND IN INDUSTRIES BEEN UNDERMINED. SO IT'S REALLY UP TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO TAKE A STAND ON BEHALF OF CONSUMERS. WITH THE LOSS OF THE CAR IN A PRIMARY. MODE OF TRANSPORTATION THE ABILITY TO SECURE AND MAINTAIN EMPLOYMENT INCOME AND OVERALL ECONOMIC SECURITY IS FURTHER JEOPARDIZED ORDER CASH STRAPPED BORROWERS. COMMUTERS OF COLOR PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO BEING INJURED BY UNREGULATED OUT OF TIME ALONE. AND THEY'LL TITLE OF INDUSTRY IS ACTUALLY WORKING TO WIDEN THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP WHICH IS THE DISPARITY OF WEALTH HOLDEN BIKE RACE. WE SEE THE CREDIT HISTORIES OF LATINOS AND BLACKS AND HAVING TAKEN A HIT BECAUSE OF LONGTIME DISCRIMINATORY LENDING PRACTICES. PREDATORY LENDERS TARGET PEOPLE OF COLOR AS THE OVERWHELMINGLY OPERATE IN BLACK AND THAT YOU KNOW NEIGHBORHOODS AND THESE LETTERS EXPLOIT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE UNDER BANKED AND UNBANKED REDLINING. THE PRIVATE SECTOR PRACTICE OF DENYING FINANCIAL SERVICES AND PRODUCTS TO NEIGHBORS OF COLOR. AND THE REASON THAT GREEN LINE EXISTS. AS A RESPONSE TO THAT. IN FACT ACCORDING TO THE FBI SEES NATIONAL SURVEY OF UNBANKED AND UNDER BANKED HOUSEHOLD IN TWENTY FIFTEEN BLACKS AND LATINOS ARE FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY BE UN BANKED. INTO TITLE LIKELY BE UNDER BANK COMPARED TO WHITES. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT BORROWS OF COLOR TWO TO THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO USE AN ALTERNATE LOAN COMPARED TO WHITES. SO MANY LOW INCOME TO MEET HOUSEHOLDS OF COLOR VEHICLE MAY BE THE ONLY ASSET AND I AM OF WEALTH AND VEHICLE REPOSSESSION. WOULD DECIMATE WEALTH FOR THE. FOR THESE FAMILIES. THE AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY THREE IS ONE STEP TOWARDS ADDRESSING OUR GROSCHEN ARE GROWING MUCH WEALTH GAP BUT MORE CLOSELY REGULATED THE PREDATORY LENDERS OPERATE IN OUR COMMITTEES. I PROTECT. ANYMORE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE. MEMBERS VERY APOLOGIZE. WHAT IS NOT POSITION? OF WE JUST STATE YOUR NAME WE HAVE THE KEY FOR IN YOUR POSITION. AND WHAT IS OPPOSITION PLEASE OF TABLE OUT. IF OF THE. IN THIS ROOM THREE GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M SORRY THIS. CHAIR. I'M. SORRY. I'M CARRIE CARBONE THE CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER INSISTS ON. I'M THE CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER FOR THE TEAM NEXT FINANCE FAMILY OF COMPANIES. UNDER THE TITLE NEXT GRAND WE DO BUSINESS IN SIXTEEN STATES. I SPENT MY CAREER REPRESENTING BANKS AND REGULATED CONSUMER LENDERS BOTH ONLINE AND RETAIL AND I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO APPEAR TODAY. WITH THE BEFORE YOU TO DISCUSS OUR OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE FIFTY THREE. TITLE MAX IS A LICENSED CALIFORNIA FINANCING LOWLANDER WITH SIXTY FOUR RETAIL LOCATIONS IN NEARLY TWO HUNDRED TEAM MEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE OPENED OUR FIRST CALIFORNIA STORE WE'RE PROUD TO HELP CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS MEET THEIR CREDIT NEEDS THROUGH THE RESPONSIBLE USE OF EMERGENCY LOANS. DYNAMAX OFFERS FULLY AMORTIZING SIMPLE INTEREST INSTALLMENT LOANS SECURED BY THE EQUITY IN OUR BORROWERS MOTOR VEHICLES. OUR CUSTOMERS ARE HARD WORKERS WITH LIMITED ACCESS TRADITIONAL BANK LOANS AND OTHER CREDIT PRODUCTS. IN MANY CASES THEY PREVIOUSLY APPLIED AND WERE DENIED FOR OTHER FORMS OF CREDIT SUCH AS PERSONAL LOANS BEFORE THEY VISITED OUR STORES. IN GENERAL CONSUMERS WHO COME TO TITLE MAX FURTHER CREDIT TECH NEEDS TEND TO BE PART OF THE ONE IN FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WHO ARE UNBANKED OR UNDER BENT. WE BELIEVE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF CREDIT HISTORY DESERVE ACCESS TO A RANGE OF REGULATED CREDIT PROXY PRODUCTS. TIMEX OFFERS A SECURED LOAN PRODUCT THAT IN ADDITION TO MEETING RIGOROUS STATE AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS INCLUDES SEVERAL FEATURES THAT ARE BENEFICIAL TO BORROWERS. CUSTOMERS CAN PREPAY THEIR LOAN IN WHOLE OR IN PART AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PENALTY. IN FACT MOST OF OUR CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS SUCCESSFULLY PAY OFF THEIR LOANS IN LESS THAN EIGHT MONTHS. MOST IMPORTANT WE DON'T SU CUSTOMERS WHO DON'T PAY US BACK OUR ONLY RECOURSE IS TO THE MOTOR VEHICLE COLLATERAL. WE APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMITTEE IS CONCERNED ABOUT VEHICLE REPOSSESSION RATES. OUR RECOVERY RATE IS LESS THAN THE STATE AVERAGE THOUGH WE ALWAYS STRIVE FOR A RATE TO BE LOWER. FEEL RECALL RECOVERY IS A LAST RESORT AND ARE EMPLOYEES ARE TRAINED TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO AVOID REPOSSESSION. IN THE ABSENCE OF FRAUD WE REPOSSESS OF VEHICLE ONLY WHEN THE ACCOUNT IS AT LEAST A MONTH PAST DUE. AND WE'VE LOST CONTACT WITH THE CUSTOMER. AS MELISSA MENTIONED BEFORE FOR SPEEDY WE OBVIOUS WE ARE EXTEND PAYMENT DUE DATES AND WORK WITH CUSTOMERS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO SUPPORT A SUCCESSFUL REPAYMENT. CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF IN CALIFORNIA WE CONDUCT A DETAILED UNDERWRITING AND ABILITY TO REPAY ANALYSIS AND WE DON'T MAKE LOANS BASED ONLY ON THE VALUE OF THE VEHICLE. AS PART OF OUR UNDERWRITING REVIEW AND CONSIDER CREDIT BUREAU DATA ABOUT APPLICANTS AS WELL AS APPLICANT INCOME AND EXPENSE INFORMATION. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WE APPROVE FEWER THAN FORTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA APPLICANTS FOR ALONE. WHICH REFLECTS OUR COMMITMENT TO APPROPRIATE UNDERWRITING AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE EXPRESS STATUTORY ABILITY TO REPAY REQUIREMENTS OF THE CFL. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE INTENT OF AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY THREE IS TO PROTECT CONSUMERS BUT THE RECAP PROPOSED IN THIS BILL WOULD ELIMINATE THE STATE'S TITLE IN INDUSTRY AND WITH IT A VIABLE CREDIT ALTERNATIVE. FOR MANY BORROWERS IN NEED. LAST YEAR WE MADE LOANS TO OVER TWELVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. UNDER THE PROPOSED RATE CAP WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HELP THOSE CONSUMERS. TO MEET THEIR NEEDS MANY THOSE BORROWER CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SELL THEIR MOTOR VEHICLES OR TURNED UNREGULATED UNLICENSED LENDERS SINCE BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS FOR THE MOST PART DON'T LEND TO THEM. MUCH EMPHASIS IS MADE ON TRIPLE DIGIT APR THAT ARE COMMON TO EMERGENCY CREDIT PRODUCTS. THE AVERAGE PAYDAY LOAN IN CALIFORNIA HAS AN AP ARE IN EXCESS OF FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT WHILE SOME UNSECURED LOAN PRODUCTS OFFERED BY MORE SOPHISTICATED ONLINE LENDERS. CAN BE CLOSER TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT PER ANNUM OR LESS. OUR CALIFORNIA SECURED LOAN PRODUCT WITH AN AVERAGE CONTRACT RATE ACROSS ALL LOAN AMOUNTS IS JUST UNDER ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PERCENT PER YEAR. WHICH FALLS ON THE LOWER END OF THE RATE SPECTRUM. NOTWITHSTANDING THE SO CALLED HIGH RATES PROFIT MARGINS FOR STATE LICENSE RETAIL SUBS ARM SUBPRIME LENDERS LIKE TITLE MAX. TYPICALLY ARE LESS THAN LARGE RETAIL BANKS. FRANKLY DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL WE'VE INVESTED IN CALIFORNIA SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND CONSIDERING THE HIGH OPERATING IN REAL STATE RELATED COSTS IN CALIFORNIA. ARE CALIFORNIA SUBSIDIARY MAY FINALLY TURNED ITS FIRST PROFIT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THOUGH THE LOAN PORTFOLIO ON ITS OWN IS PROFITABLE. S. STORE IN THE LOS ANGELES MAN MSA CAN COST OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH TO OPERATE CONSIDERING LEASE COST UTILITIES EMPLOYEE SALARIES AND BENEFITS. AND OTHER GENERAL OPERATING EXPENSES THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE FUNDS NEEDED TO MAKE LOANS OR LOAN ORIGINATION SERVICING OR COLLECTIONS COSTS. WE ARE COMMITTED TO OUR CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS EMPLOYEES AND LOOK FOR TO SERVING THE ALTERNATIVE CREDIT NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS FOR YEARS TO COME. AND SET OF ARBITRARY RATE CAPS PLEASE CONSIDER REASONABLE REGULATIONS THAT PROTECT CONSUMERS AND ELIMINATE BAG ACTORS WHILE PRESERVING ACCESS TO A CONVENIENT AND REGULATED LOAN OPTION. WE URGE YOU TO VOTE NO ON TWENTY NINE FIFTY THREE THANK YOU. AB CHAIR MISTER VICE CHAIR THAT MY NAME IS JABOT COVERT AND I'M THE AT SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR. CHECKING THE CASHIN WELL LICENSE LINDER ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCLUDING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. HAPPILY SO AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM MADAM CHAIR BUT WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT WORKING WITH YOU FURTHER ON. THE PROCESS IS WE GO FORWARD AND I THINK MANY OF YOU ON THE COMMITTEE INCLUDING THE CHAIR I THANK YOU ALL OF. A LOT MOST OF YOU HAVE BEEN IN ONE OF OUR STORES BEFORE YOU UNDERSTAND OUR PRODUCTS AND. I THINK THIS CONVERSATION'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL AND IT IS HISTORICAL I FEEL LIKE UPSET MISTER SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE YEARS AND I HAVE. I KNOW IT'S LATE WE'VE GOT DINNERS WITH MOM AND BASKETBALL GAMES TO GO SEE BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE A COUPLE OF QUICK POINTS IN OUT. ON LEAVE IT ALONE BUT YOU KNOW IT. WE REPOSSESSED LESS THAN THREE CARS PER LOCATION LAST YEAR. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT BIG NUMBERS FROM THE DB ó I DON'T KNOW WHO IT IS THAT'S DOING THAT BUT IT'S NOT MY COMPANY. THAT'S NOT THE WAY WE DO BUSINESS. THAT'S NOT WHAT WE DO ARE FEDERAL REGULATOR PUT OUT A BI ANNUAL REPORT TODAY THAT COVERED THE ENTIRE COUNTRY. AND THE TALK ABOUT COMPLAINTS OF CONSUMERS FOR EVERY FINANCIAL PRODUCT IN AMERICA. TITLE LOANS WAS POINT. ONE PERCENT. OF ALL THE COMPLAINTS THAT WHAT THE VETERAN YOU LATER POINT ONE PERCENT. SO I I DON'T THINK OUR CUSTOMERS ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PRODUCTS BUT I POINT THIS OUT REAL QUICK. WE TALKED ABOUT MARILYN YOUNG BROTHER MARYLAND YOU DON'T WHY MARYLAND OF HAVING LENDING BECAUSE IT'S THIRTY THREE PERCENT. THIS BILL WILL PUT US AT A BUSINESS AS IS MADAM CHAIR BUT WE ARE OPEN TO REFORM WE BELIEVE THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT DISCLOSURES AND I WAS OF A POINT OF. CONTENTION REPOSSESSIONS A POINT OF CONTENTION THINGS THAT WE ARE VERY VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF TALKING WITH YOU ABOUT SO WITH THAT MISTER VICE CHAIR I WOULD LIKE THE ABOUT TIME TO. OKAY IT JUGGLING REPRESENTING COMMUNITY LOANS OF AMERICA THAT OF MEDICARE. THE. EXIT LA THINGS TO SAY THAT I THINK FOR THE MOST PART THE THINGS THAT I WAS GOING TO SAY HAVE ALREADY BEEN SET. I WILL SAY OUR CUSTOMERS. TEND TO BE IN THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES. THEY TEND TO BE INDEPENDENTLY OWNED BUSINESSES WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL. AND WHO NEED ACCESS TO CAPITAL OFTENTIMES THEIR VEHICLE THEIR TRUCK IS THEIR PRIMARY ASSET. AND THEY NEED THAT ABILITY TO HAVE ACCESS TO CAPITAL TO PERFORM THEIR JOB WHETHER IT'S IN THE PAINTING BUSINESS A LANDSCAPE BUSINESS. UP THE SECOND. MAJOR. PART OF OUR BUSINESS ARE IN FACT PEOPLE THAT ARE UNBANKED PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE ACCESS TO GO TO TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. BECAUSE THEY ARE UNBANKED. AND THE THIRD ARE THOSE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CREDIT SCORES. BELOW SIX TWENTY. MAYBE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW. AND BECAUSE OF THAT OR HAVE NO CREDIT HISTORY AT ALL. FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO GO TO TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL. EARLIER TODAY BY HAND DISCUSSING ASSEMBLYMAN BECAUSE BILL I THINK THE COMMITTEE. POSE THE RIGHT QUESTION AND THAT IS WHAT IS THE RIGHT BALANCE BETWEEN ACCESS. AND NOT. CREATING UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR ACCESS VERSUS MAKING SURE THAT. THE CONSUMER TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ONE OF THESE PRODUCTS ISN'T ESSENTIALLY SETTING THEMSELVES UP FOR THIS. VORTEX OF DEBT. AND THE STEPS SPIRAL INTO SOMETHING THAT CAN NEVER BE PAID OFF. THAT BALLOTS IS I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT. AN INTEREST RATE CAP BY ITSELF DOESN'T REALLY PROVIDE. WHAT IT WILL DO IS IT WILL MAKE SURE THAT A LOT OF ACCESS TO CREDIT WILL NO LONGER BE ACCESSIBLE? ON THE OTHER HAND. BALANCING. THIS PRODUCT WITH A VARIETY OF TOOLS THAT I THINK ARE AVAILABLE AT THIS COMMITTEES. URGING I THINK MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. I THINK YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THE WITNESSES TODAY TALK ABOUT WHAT ARE THE POLICIES RIGHT NOW WHAT WHAT DO WE DO IN THE BUSINESS. THOSE THINGS DON'T EXIST IN RULES AND STATUTES OR REGULATIONS BY AND LARGE. THINGS LIKE NON RECOURSE LOANS HOW DO YOU STOP THAT DEATH SPIRAL OF. OF DEBT. THE FIRST THING IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THESE LOANS ARE NON RECOURSE LOANS WHICH MEANS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE GOING AFTER THE PERSON AND FORCING THEM INTO BANKRUPTCY. OF IF WE REPOSSESS THE CAR AND OUR. REPOSSESSION RATE IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN WHAT WAS DISCUSSED BUT IF THAT IN FACT IT'S A CONCERN AND RIGHTFULLY SHOULD BE IF IT. IF REPOSSESSION RATES ARE TWENTY PERCENT THAT'S TOO HIGH. IF WE REPOSSESS THE CAR WE'VE ALREADY LOST. IT'S A LOSING PROPOSITION FROM THE WORD GO. WE DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW TO HAVE A NOR DO WE LIKE WE POSSESSING A CAR BECAUSE WE ALREADY LOST MONEY WE'RE NEVER GOING TO RECOVER WHAT'S BEEN LOST. IN TERMS OF CAPITAL. BUT MAKING SURE THAT THE LOAN IS A NON CREE RECOURSE LOAN. STOPS THE DESPOT OR RIGHT THERE. OF. NEVADA HAS THE STATUE. THAT IS CENTURY PROVIDES AN OFFERING. TUMORS AND THAT OFFRAMP. STOPS TOLLING OF THE INTEREST RATE. SO THAT IF IN FACT THE CONSUMER FIND THEMSELVES IN A PLACE WHERE WHERE THEY ARE LATE OR IN DEFAULT. THERE'S A WAY TO SAVE TIME OUTLETS RESTRUCTURED CREATE A REPAYMENT PLAN THAT DOESN'T ADD MORE INTEREST TO THE LAW. VERIFYING THE VALUE OF THE VEHICLE NEAR AT TWO MINUTES BECAUSE NONE OF US ARE OUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT THAT I'M GONNA HAVE. I HAVE SIX OTHER THINGS HERE. ALL WHICH I THINK A GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICES WATCHING LOAN TO VALUE. MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE AREN'T MONNING MORE THE ACTUAL VALUE OF THE AUTOMOBILE THAT. TRIBUTES TO THAT THAT'S WHAT. HAVING UNDERWRITING. IN THAT CAN TO INCOME RATIOS. THAT CAN SERVE TO HELP BUT BE A BETTER JUDGE OF WHETHER SOMEBODY HAS THE ABILITY TO REPAY NOW. IT BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE STRICT DEBT TO INCOME RATIOS. YOU'RE LEAVING PEOPLE ON THE MARGINS AND PUBLIC PEOPLE THAT YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO SO. BUT THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE WE CAN HAVE THIS DIALOGUE. ITEM AS ASSEMBLY WOMAN WEBER WAS TALKING ABOUT HISTORY I WAS HERE FIVE YEARS AGO TESTIFYING ON A BILL SIMILAR TO THIS. AT THAT TIME WE DIDN'T HAVE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT. OTHER THINGS TO DO WHAT WOULD BE SMART TO DO THE ARGUMENT WAS STRICTLY ABOUT AN INTEREST RATE. I THINK NOW THE ENVIRONMENTS CHANGE THE WORLD'S CHANGED. WE CAN HAVE THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING HERE. TO STOP THAT DEATH SPIRAL OF. AND AND I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF IBM WANTS AMERICA TO SAY WE WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT DISCUSSION WE WILL CONTRIBUTE TO IT WE WILL MAKE SUGGESTIONS. ABOUT THINGS THAT WE THINK WOULD MAKE SENSE AND. LOOKS FORWARD TO HAVING THAT DISCUSSION ENSUES. THANK YOUR A MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE JUST TAKE YOUR NAME AND POSITION. ALICIA PRIEGO ON BEHALF OF LAMAR IN OPPOSITION.

AND SO IF IT IS A GOOD FAITH HONEST EFFORT ON YOUR PART YOU'RE GONNA FIND A LOT OF WILLING PARTICIPANTS ON THIS AND TO FIND OUT. THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEST PATH FORWARD AS PER REALLY WANT TO STRESS THAT. I THAT YOU WERE COMING FROM A POSITION WHERE CHANGES HAPPENING. AND WE ARE DETERMINED TO CREATE CHANGE. AND SO UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT'S WHERE WE'RE COMING FROM. WE REALLY WANT ATTITUDE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT CHANGES SOMETHING THAT IS EQUITABLE FOR EVERYONE AS A BUSINESS YOU AGAIN LIKE I SAID BEFORE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO EARN A DOLLAR. AND AND TO PAY YOUR EMPLOYEES. A LIVABLE WAGE AND CONSIDER. YOU KNOW THE US IS WILLING PARTICIPANTS AS WELL AS THIS CHAIR YELLOW. VERY PROGRESSIVE CHAIR OF A COMMITTEE THAT'S WILLING TO TO UNDERSTAND AND LEARN THIS BUSINESS SO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. I HAVE A VERY. WILLING PARTICIPANT IN THIS AUTHOR TO FIGURE OUT WHAT AT WHAT WHAT A FAIR PLAY STAND UP IS SO PLEASE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. AND KNOW THAT IF THERE'S A GOOD FAITH EFFORT ON YOUR PART THERE WILL BE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT ON OUR PART TO TRY AND CREATE A FAIR PROGRAM. AND I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY AND AGAIN MADAM CHAIR I THINK YOU FOR TIME IN THE BILL IN THE FOR DEVOTING AYE. AND SO ON INTEREST DOWN. SO SO YOU MENTION THAT YOU DO BUSINESS IN OTHER STATES AS WELL. WHERE IN SIXTEEN STATES WITH THE TITLE MAX BRAND AS WELL AS FLORIDA UNDER A DIFFERENT BRAND NEW YORK? NOT IN NEW YORK OKAY WHAT ABOUT CHECK INTO CASH. THAT SAME ANSWER NOT NEW YORK. WANNA. IT IS THERE'S NOT A INTEREST RATE THERE'S NOT A INTEREST ARAB FEE AMOUNT THAT WOULD MAKE IT A VIABLE PRODUCT. OKAY WE DON'T OPERATE IT'S NOT FIVE FINANCIALLY VIABLE TO DO SO THAT SCRIPT. SIMMONS ON THAT THAT THERE'S A FALLACY THAT THERE SOME OUR ALL THE STORES THAT ARE OUT THERE MAKING TITLE LOANS THIRTY SIX PERCENT AND. THERE CERTAINLY ARE ZERO STORES DOING IT AT A PROFIT THIRTY SIX PERCENT WE WELCOME THAT. CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS FROM HELPING OUT MEMBERS OUR COMMUNITY OF IT THAT'S A GREAT THING AND WE ENCOURAGE THAT AND WE ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE AND DONATE THE GROUPS THAT DO THAT BUT THERE AREN'T A FOR PROFIT THIRTY SIX PERCENT. TITLE LENDERS THAT ARE OUT THERE ONE YORK HAS A A LIMIT OF SIXTY PERCENT ON UNLICENSED AND TWENTY FIVE PERCENT ON LICENSE AND YET THERE ARE. TITLE LOANS AND THOSE THINGS GOING ON THEIR SIDE THAT'S WHY I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT? HOW THAT WORKS IN IN STATES WITH CAPS SO THERE ARE TRADITIONAL INSTALLMENT LENDERS INCLUDING CALIFORNIA WHO DO BUSINESS ACROSS THE COUNTRY? ON A STATE LICENSE LEVEL WHERE NONBANK LENDERS. SO INTEREST RATES ON THE LOANS MAY BE. AT THAT WHATEVER THE STATE CABINS ARE CERTAINLY WOULD BE FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE FRANK BUT THEY MAY ALSO SELL OTHER PRODUCTS IN THOSE STORES THAT. AREN'T PART OF THE FINANCE CHARGE FOR PURPOSES OF TEALA AND THEREFORE ARE NOT PART OF THE A PR OR THE INTEREST RATE CAP. TO ANCILLARY CREDIT PRODUCTS INSURANCE PRODUCTS ANY NUMBER OF OTHER PRODUCTS THAT MIGHT BE APPLICABLE. FOR THAT PARTICULAR LENDER AND THAT WAS NOTHING WOULD HAVE SIMILAR SO THAT THAT NO ONE SOON IT WILL FOR JUST THAT AMOUNT THEIR OTHER AMOUNTS THAT ARE COMING IN. FRIDAY MAY BE UP RIGHT DIVERSIFIED REVENUE STREAMS. FOR THAT COMPANY. WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THINK YOU AYE IT YOU KNOW I I WANT TO SAY THAT AT THEIR TWENTY FIVE STATES PLUS THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THAT DON'T HAVE CAR TITLE. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA WOULD BE JOINING THESE TWENTY FIVE CENT STATES PLUS THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA I ALSO WANT HIM BUT JUST CLARIFY SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP A LOT IT'S ABOUT DATA DATA DATA. ON OUR DB ó REPORT THAT CAME OUT LAST YEAR I TALKED ABOUT THE TWENTY THOUSAND CARS THAT WERE REPOSSESS AT A HUNDRED AND EAT. I THOUSAND ASK ORIGINATION. TITLES AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS INFORMATION IS GATHERED. BY INFORMATION THAT THE COMPANY'S PRESENT AND SIGN OFF ON THIS IS NOT ABSTRACT DATA. SO THIS INFORMATION THAT GOES TO THE DB YOU KNOW SENT AS FACTUAL INFORMATION EVERY COMPANY IN CALIFORNIA SIGNS OFF TO IT SO I THINK THAT WHILE THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT MORE INFORMATION IS HELPFUL I DON'T WANT. TO AYE YOU TO TO KIND OF SCRUTINIZE THE THE INTEGRITY OF THAT DATA WHAT WE DO HAVE DOES TELL US SOMETHING AND IT'S SOMETHINGTHAT HELPS US MOVE IN A DIRECTION. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US HAS A CONSTITUENT OR TWO OR THREE OR MORE IN OUR DISTRICT THAT REPRESENTS THESE TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO HAD THEIR CARDS REPOSSESSED. THAT CAR IS A MEAN TO GET TO AND FROM WORK THAT CAR IS A MEANS TO GET TO THEIR SCHOOLS IT'S I MEAN TO GET ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE THIS IS REAL. BUT IMPACT OF LOSING THAT CAR IS FAR BEYOND JUST NOT BEING ABLE TO MAKE A PAYMENT IT HAS IMPACTS FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US IN OUR DISTRICT BECAUSE WE REPRESENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR CAR. AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO ENSURE THAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM SOME OF THE LESSONS THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN OUR COUNTRY IN OUR STATE PARTICULARLY AROUND BLENDING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT LENDING DECISIONS. ARE BASED ON THE CONSUMER CONSUMERS ABILITY TO REPAY THE LOAN AND NOT THE VALUE OF THE ASSET. THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT'S HOW SO MANY PEOPLE LOST HOMES. AND SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. AB TWENTY NINE FIFTY THREE DO PASSED COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. LAMONT BY LIMON AYE. CHEN. CHEN NOT LOADING. ACOSTA. BURKE. CALDERON.
