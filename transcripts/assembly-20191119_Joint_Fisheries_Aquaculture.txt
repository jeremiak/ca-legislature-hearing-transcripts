AS PUTTING FISH FROM THE HIGHWAYS IN THE FAST LANE HERE IN CALIFORNIA HONORED TO BE TO BE WITH YOU MY NAME IS MIKE MCGUIRE IN A GRATEFUL TO BE A SHORT CHAIR THIS JOINT COMMITTEE WE WELCOME ALL OF OUR HARDWORKING FISHERMEN IN AGENCY REPRESENTATIVES AND SEEN GAS FROM THE- CRAB AND FISH WORLD TO BE ABLE TO BE HERE TODAY- AND WE START. THIS HEARING CANDIDLY ON A SOMBER NOTE IN WITH HEAVY HEARTS. REASONS THAT ARE STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. THE FISHING VESSEL MISS HALEY CAPSIZED AND SANK QUICKLY OFF THE COAST OF THE DATABASE. THE RESULT IN LOSS OF A DECK IN OUR NEW FULL SANTIAGO HAS LEFT THE FISHING COMMUNITY GRIEF STRICKEN AND AS WE START TODAY'S HEARING OUR THOUGHTS GO OUT TO HIS FAMILY IN FOR AN- OUR FOCUS TODAY WILL BE ON WHEN THE GOLDEN STATE SCRAP FISHERY. CAN BE LUNCH FOR THE SEASON. AND TODAY WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON THE INITIAL CONVERSATION ABOUT LAUNCHING A LONG TERM STRATEGY TO MAKE STATE HIGHWAYS. FRIENDLY FOR ENDANGERED FISH SPECIES WOULD LIKE TO BETTER OFFER SOME OPENING COMMENTS ON THE CRAB SEASON FIRST. A MERE THREE WEEKS AGO IT APPEARED WE WOULD HAVE A NORMAL OPENER FOR OUR CRAP SEATED IF THERE IS ANY SUCH THING ANYMORE. WE NOW EXPERIENCING DELAYS DUE TO CRAP QUALITY WAIT IN PARTICULAR RISK- MARINE LIFE ENTANGLEMENT WITH AN EMPHASIS ON WHALES AND TOMORROW GAS IT CONCERNS. BUT LEVELS HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS LEVELS A DEMO GAS IT IN MOST AREAS OF THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST ARE LOWER THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST. COUPLE OF YEARS THERE ARE ONLY TWO LOCATIONS IT'S STILL NEED A CLEAN TEST THAT'S IT USE ALL NORTH OF FOR BRAG IN DUXBURY NEAR SAN FRANCISCO. THAT WE WANT TAKE A MOMENT SAID HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IN PUBLIC HEALTH TO TRULY BUSTED THEIR TAILS TO BE ABLE TO GET FISHERMEN OUT ON THE OCEAN. WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE FISHERMEN FOR THEIR PATIENCE AND PERSISTENCE TRYING TO GET THIS SEASON KICKED OFF. AB SEASON WILL BE OPENING IF ALL GOES WELL. KNOCK WHAT ESPECIALLY AT SOUTH IN THE MENDOCINO COUNTY LINE I NOVEMBER TWENTY SECOND WHICH I ALSO KNOW- IS I GIVE YOU A WHOLE LOT OF TIME TO BE ABLE TO MOBILIZE. MENDOCINO DOWN OR CARRY HOWEVER IS PLANNED TO OPEN ON DECEMBER SIXTEENTH ASSUMING WE GET POSITIVE TEST BACK ON CRAP QUALITY FOCUSED ON MAKING SURE THOSE CRABS ARE GETTING FAT. IN MY- THERE WAYNE ENOUGH. HERE'S WHAT THIS MEANS THOUGH IF WE'RE ABLE TO OPEN HERE ON THE TWENTY SECOND. WE'RE GONNA HAVE FRESH. HIGH QUALITY SUCCULENT CRAP FOR THANKSGIVING CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEARS AND ALL OF OUR FESTIVE EVENTS OR A GUESS WHAT THE HECK IN THE MONTHS TO COME. THE SECOND HALF OF OUR HEARING IS GONNA BE FOCUSING. ON HOW WE MAKE OUR HIGHWAYS HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE FRESH FRIENDLY. AS JOHN THOUGH CALTRANS HAS OVER ABOUT SIX THOUSAND POTENTIAL BARRIERS- TO ENDANGERED FISH SPECIES WITH FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE I KNOWN. LOCATIONS CALTRANS IS THE SINGLE LARGEST OWNER AND MANAGER OF FISH PASSAGE WHERE YEARS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THESE BARRIERS WALK MIGRATION OF A DOLE IN BABY SALMON AND DENY ACCESS TO HUNDREDS OF MILES OF FISHERY HABITAT. WE NEED TO GET THEM FIXING ME TO GET THEM FIXED FAST BUT BECAUSE OUR FISH. AND THEIR THIS SPECIES CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER. FOR EVERY STREAM MILE THAT WE RECONNECT TWELVE JOBS ARE SUPPORTED AND THERE'S MORE THAN A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR BENEFIT TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. EVERY FISH PASSAGE IMPROVEMENT STRUCTURE THAT IS COMPLETED BENEFITS FROM A MAINTENANCE FREE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S LIKELY THE LAST HALF TO A FULL CENTURY. CALIFORNIANS AND DANE CALIFORNIA'S ENDANGERED FISH POPULATIONS ARE ON THE BRINK ESPECIALLY IN THE FACE OF A CHANGING CLIMATE. THERE'S A LOT THAT THE STATE CAN DO TO HELP RECOVERY AT THE RECOVERY OF ENDANGERED FISH SPECIES AND ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL STEPS THAT THE STATE CAN TAKE IT TO REMOVE THE THOUSANDS OF FISH MIGRATION BARRIERS. THAT EXIST ON OUR STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. AGAIN WE WELCOME ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY ESPECIALLY THANK THOSE WHO TRAVEL FROM FAR AND WIDE INCLUDING OUR CHIEF CONSULTANT WHO CAME DOWN FROM EUREKA- IT TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH AN IMPORTANT EVENT. FOR THE LEGISLATURE ARE FISHERIES OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR ECONOMY. WE ARE GONNA BE LIVE STREAM TODAY. YEAH AND RECORDED AND WE'RE pWILDLIFE NOT TO SWEAR IS USUALLY DOES. SO I'M KIDDING- IN OF COURSE WE'RE GONNA BE HAVING PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF THE PRESENTATIONS OF Y'ALL DON'T MIND PLEASE HANG WITH US- IN OF COURSE BUT WE'LL GET RIGHT TO YOU. AT THE END OF THE HEARING WITHOUT FURTHER ADO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE A THAT WELCOME. THE DIRECTOR EFFICIENT LILAC MISTER CHUCK BONHAM. TO AT THE TABLE PLEASE.

IN HE'S GOING TO BE KICKING OFF OUR FIRST PANEL- IN ITS THE STATE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY DUNGENESS CRAB SEASON- THE MARINE HEAT WAVE TO MARK ACID AND THE THREAT OF WHALE ENTANGLEMENT. WE'RE ALSO GONNA WELCOME UP IN SIN NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO JOIN THE DIRECTOR HI BENSON IS THE CHIEF FOOD AND- THE FOOD AND DRUG BRANCH FROM CALVARY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WE'RE IN A WELCOME- IT APPEAR IF YOU ALL CAN COME ON UP RIGHT NOW PLEASE THANK YOU MASTER HE'S A PROGRAM MANAGER FOR THE MARINE REGION WITH THE CALVET. WILDLIFE WE WELCOME SUSAN RIGHT WINE THAT TO THE TABLE SHE'S A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST CRAP ASSOCIATION PLEASE COME ON FORWARD. AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO WELCOME WE'RE GONNA SERGEANTS WE CAN GET ONE MORE- AT CHAIR IS WELL THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE ALSO GONNA WELCOME NO OPPENHEIM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATION. MR BONHAM IS GOING TO BE GIVING US AN OVERVIEW ON WHAT TO EXPECT THIS CRAB SEASON HE'S GONNA BE FOCUSING ON SOME VERY KEY AREAS- OCEAN CONDITIONS WHERE WE AT WITH. THE ARE UNDER WATER HEAT WAVE THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEN. IT'S GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT DISASTER RELIEF FIND DISTRIBUTION DEMO GAP THE TESTING CRAP QUALITY. HE'S GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON- WAY OPENS ANDWE'RE GOING THEY AVOID WHALES THIS COMING CRAB SEASON. AND OF COURSE HE'S COULD BE SPEAKING TO THE DELAY OF THE SEASON AND OBVIOUSLY ANY OTHER ISSUES HE DEEMS APPROPRIATE. AGAIN MISTER AFTER WE WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE IS ALWAYS. THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND YOU HAVE TEN MINUTES SIR. GREAT THANK YOU SENATOR. I SUPPOSE SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT LIKE MY LAW THANK TENURE AND OTHERS MET. SO I'LL LEAVE IT TO THE- THE DEPARTMENT STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE UP THEIR MIND ABOUT THOSE THINGS HI. I WON'T BE AROUND THIS AFTERNOON BUT I DID WANT TO SAY ONE THING- THE DEPARTMENT AND I IS DIRECTOR ARE VERY PRO FISH PASSAGE PROJECT. WE ARE THANKFUL FOR THE PARTNERSHIP CONVERSATIONS WERE STARTING WITH CALTRANS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO A BRIGHT FUTURE IN THAT WORK WITH THEM SO WE APPRECIATE YOU HAVING A PANEL THIS AFTERNOON ON THE- THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR. WE START WITH KIND OF. A COMMENTARY AROUND OCEAN CONDITIONS THAT MIGHT ALLOW FOLKS TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND CALM A LITTLE. PEOPLE MAY RECALL THAT ABOUT A MONTH AGO A WE WERE SEEING SOME A BRICK IN OUR MEDIA SPACE AROUND THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANOTHER WARM WATER BLOB. I KNOW FOR WOMAN I READ THOSE STORIES I HAD A FREAK OUT BECAUSE THE WARM WATER BLOOD THE LAST GO AROUND WAS IMMENSELY CHALLENGING FOR ALL OF US. WHAT WE NOW KNOW TODAY IS LOOKING AT THE LATEST IMAGES WE SEE THAT THE MARINE HEAT FORM OR THE HEAT WAVE HAS REFORMED INTO A SINGLE. YET MUCH SMALLER FEATURE AS COMPARED TO THE MAXIMUM SIZE IT ONCE HAD- IN THESE OBSERVATIONS IN AUGUST TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND THAT THIS KIND OF HEAT HAS MOVED FARTHER OFF SHORE RATHER THAN MOVING NEAR SHORE WHICH WERE SOME OF THE DYNAMICS WE SAW LAST GO AROUND THEY DON'T APPEAR TO BE ESTABLISHING THEMSELVES. THIS GO AROUND. SEE SERVICE TEMPERATURES HAVE COOLED ACROSS MUCH OF THE NEAR SHORE AREAS FOR THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES WEST COAST. BOTH SOUTHERN OREGON AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. ARE CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING COLDER THAN AVERAGE TEMPERATURES. UNLIKE THE BLOB OF TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN WHICH REMAINED NEAR THE COAST. ALL DURING THE FALL AND DURING THE WINTER. THE CURRENT MARINE HEATWAVE IS RETREATED TO A LOCATION MUCH FURTHER OFF SHORE. THIS IS BETTER NEWS THAN MANY OF US ALL REPORTED IN THE MEDIA ABOUT A MONTH AGO. NOW OF COURSE THE CONDITIONS ARE GONNA BECOME INCREASINGLY DYNAMIC AS THROUGH THE TYPICAL CYCLE OF FALL AND WINTER STORMS. AS THOSE STORMS BEGIN FORMING IN THE NORTHEAST PACIFIC BUT ON-THIS TOPIC I THINK THE NEWS IS BETTER COMPARED TO WARS- PARTICULARLY WHEN ONE FACTORS IN THE ORIGINAL REPORTING ABOUT A MONTH AGO. NEXT TOPIC YOU ASKED ME TO COVER IS THE TOPIC OF DISASTER RELIEF FUND DISTRIBUTION. AS ME- YOU YOUR LEADERSHIP OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE OUR CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES. BOTH GOOD BROWN AND GOVERNOR NEWSOME AND OUR DEPARTMENT OF WORKED REALLY HARD TO PROVIDE DISASTER RELIEF FOR AFFECTED FISHERY COMMUNITIES WE'RE ON THE BACK END OF A LOT OF THIS WORK THE MONEY'S COME IN AND HERE'S PROBABLY THE MOST CURRENT UPDATE. SO THE FINAL BATCH OF PAYMENTS ARE ACTUALLY IN THE MAIL. EFFECTED FISHER MEN AND WOMEN AND INDUSTRIES WE ARE WORKING ON THE MITIGATION PORTION OF THE DISASTER RELIEF. SO OUR TOTAL PAY OUT SO FAR I BELIEVE IS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY TWO. MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND DUNGENESS CRAB TOTAL WAS TWENTY TWO MILLION ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND I BELIEVE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND WENT TO THE ROCK CROWDS ROCK CRAP SECTOR WHICH IS YOU KNOW IS GEOGRAPHICALLY MORE LIMITED DOWN INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AROUND THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. SO THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY DRAFTING THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AROUND THAT MITIGATION ASPECT. AND WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR US SPENDING PLAN. TO IMPROVE THEIR LAB CAPABILITIES AND THAT SPENDING PLAN I BELIEVE IS THE THIS IS AT THE PACIFIC STATE. RAIN FISHERIES COMMISSION WHICH BY THE WAY CONGRATULATIONS FOR YOUR REAPPOINTMENT TO. SO THAT'S THAT'S OUR QUICK SUMMARY ON DISASTER RELIEF. YOU ALSO ASKED THAT I COVER WHAT THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES TO BE THE DUNGENESS CRAB TASK FORCE PRIORITIES AS WE'VE HEARD THEM EXPRESS POSSIBLE PRIORITIES TO US. HERE'S OUR IMPRESSION OF THE THINGS THEY'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON IN THE MEDIA FUTURE. NOT SURPRISINGLY THEY REQUESTED A MORE DETAILED ACCOUNTING OF THE DUNGEON IS CRAB TRAP LIMIT ACCOUNT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THERE ARE PERPETUALLY INTERESTED IN. THE SPECIFICS OF HOW THE DEPARTMENT TO SPENDS THESE FUNDS SO WE'RE VERY OKAY WITH GOING TO THAT NOVEL NEXT LEVEL TRANSPARENCY. THEY ALSO WANT TO ENSURE I THINK THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE CONTRACTS THAT WE ARE ENGAGING AND ARE FOR THE FULL APPROVED AMOUNT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AND I THINK THEY'RE FOCUSED ON THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN NTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT THEIR TASK FORCE MEETINGS CAN OCCUR. AS NEEDED ON A REGULAR FREQUENCY AND THAT TRAVEL REIMBURSEMENTS FOR MEMBERS ARE AVAILABLE SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE SUFFICIENT PARTICIPATION. MY IMPRESSION IS THE TASK FORCES SUPPORT OF OUR DEPARTMENT AND OUR SISTER HEALTH AGENCIES. STARTING TO DEVELOP SOMETHING I BELIEVE WE'RE CALLING KIND OF A BIO TOXIN MANAGEMENT ZONE APPROACH. IF WE CAN BRING A LITTLE MORE MORE CLARITY TO THE PARTS OF THE OCEAN AND THAT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON FOR MANAGEMENT. AND HEALTH CONCERNS AND THINK ABOUT DOING THOSE MANAGEMENT ZONES CONNECTED TO REGULATIONS AROUND OF THIS RACE OR ORDERS. SO THAT'S KIND OF SOMETHING I THINK THEIR SUPPORT OF WE DO WE'RE IN THE EARLY CHAPTERS OF BUILDING THAT OUT WITH THE PH BUT I EXPECT THAT'S WORK AHEAD WITH THE TASK FORCE. OKAY SO LET'S SHIFT THE CRAB AND START WITH THE RECREATIONAL GRAB. SO THE FOLKS THAT ARE OUT THERE IN A SPORT FISHERY NOT A COMMERCIAL FISHERY. SO THE UPDATE ON RECREATIONAL DUNGEONS GRAB IS AS FOLLOWS. ON NOVEMBER SECOND THE RECREATIONAL FISHERY OPENED- WITH TO MOLECH ACID HEALTH ADVISORIES FOR SHELTER COVE IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY. SOUTH TO POINT ARENA IN MENDOCINO COUNTY AND FROM POINT REYES IN MARIN COUNTY. SOUTH TO PILLAR POINT IN SAN MATEO COUNTY. ON NOVEMBER FIFTH OUR DEPARTMENT DISCUSS CHANGES IN FRONT OF THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION THROUGH THE COMMISSION'S MARINE SOURCE RESOURCES COMMITTEE THAT WE THINK SHOULD BE MADE TO THE RECREATIONAL FISHERY. TO MOVE IT INTO A MORE ANALOGOUS APPROACH THAT THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR IS TAKING IN ORDER TO BE WILL SAVE. AS YOU KNOW IN THE LAST YEAR TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS WE'VE HAD A LOT OF ENERGY AROUND WHAT MIGHT BE CHANGES A PRACTICE IN THE COMMERCIAL FISHING SPACE. AND WE BELIEVE IT THE DEPARTMENT'S IMPORTANT TO PURSUE SIMILAR CHANGES IN THE RECREATIONAL CRAB FISHERY SPACES WELL. THERE'S AN EQUITY ISSUE BETWEEN THE TWO SECTORS AND THERE'S ALSO I BELIEVE- TRUE INTEREST IN BOTH SECTORS UNDERSTANDING HOW TO BE MORE WILL SAVE. SO WE'VE TAKEN THAT TO OUR FISH AND GAME COMMISSION WHY DO WE NEED TO GO THERE. THEY HAVE THE STATUTORY MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY OVER THE RECREATIONAL FISHERS. WE HAVE THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY OVER THE COMMERCIAL FISHERS. SO MY IMPRESSION IS THAT- COMMISSIONS MARINE RESOURCES COMMITTEE- DISCUSSED A VARIETY OF OPTIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND PLANS TO PRESENT IN THE DECEMBER MEETING WHICH I BELIEVE IS IN SACRAMENTO. AROUND RULE MAKING OPTIONS FOR CHANGING THE RECREATIONAL CRAB FISHERY. SO THAT BRINGS US TO- PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT UPDATE I HAVE. AND THAT'S AROUND THE OPENING OF THE DUNGEON IS GRAB COMMERCIAL FISHERY AND THE WAY I STARTED THINK ABOUT IT IS TO USE THIS IDEA OF RULES AND I'M I MEAN IT KIND OF AN INFORMAL SENSE. BUT TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WE HAVE THREE SETS OF RULES THAT ARE PRIDE TO OPENING DUNGENESS CRAB COMMERCIAL FISHERY. AND IT TURNS OUT QUALITY TESTING THE TESTING OF THE MEAT IN THE CRAB TO FIGURE OUT IF THEY'RE FAT OR SKINNY. IS ACTUALLY OUR OLDEST AND ARGUABLY OUR MOST RELIABLE SET OF RULES AT THIS POINT. THEY'VE BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME THE STATES OF CALIFORNIA OREGON AND WASHINGTON HAVE US TRY STATE APPROACH TO THIS QUALITY TESTING THE FLEET UNDERSTANDS THESE RULES AND EVERY YEAR WE'RE LOOKING AT TESTING OF QUALITY DETERMINE OPENER SO WHAT'S HAPPENED SO FAR. IS THE CRAB QUALITY TESTING RESULTS IN THE PROGNOSIS SOME THINGS WE'VE DONE IS REALLY ONLY APPLICABLE TO THE NORTHERN MANAGEMENT AREAS SO THINK MENDOCINO ON UP THE COAST. AND ON NOVEMBER THIRTEENTH WE CAN CONFIRM WE HAVE POOR CRAB QUALITY BASED ON THESE TESTING PROTOCOLS. THE TRI STATE KIND OF STRUCTURE A GOOD READ TO DELAY THE DECEMBER FIRST OPENER UNTIL DECEMBER FIFTEENTH. SO WE'LL KEEP DOING TESTING THE FIRST WEEK OF DECEMBER. WE WILL HAVE WHAT'S CALLED FAIR START TRIGGERED IN THE NORTHERN MANAGEMENT AREA. AND WE'VE HAD A DIRECTOR MEMO PUT OUT TO DELAY THE FISHERY DO THE QUALITY WE'VE DONE OUR TYPICAL INFORMATIONAL PRESS RELEASE AND WITH POSTED ALL OF OUR USUAL FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION KIND OF OUR REACH MATERIAL AROUND THE ISSUE OF CRAP QUALITY. I WOULD ALSO SAY WE THINK INTERNALLY THE PROGNOSIS IS IFFY THE NOT SO GOOD FOR THAT NORTHERN FISHERY TO OPEN ON DECEMBER FIFTEENTH. AND IT'S POSSIBLE IT COULD CONTINUE TO BE DELAYED UNTIL JANUARY. AND REMEMBER THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE ME FOLLOWING THAT OLDEST AND MOST RELIABLE SET OF RULES WE HAVE AT THIS POINT. THAT REALLY BRINGS US TO THE SECOND SET OF RULES AND AGAIN I USE RULES IN THE MORE INFORMAL SENSE. THIS SET OF RULES IS AROUND THE TOPIC OF THE MALL LIKE ACID. IT'S NEWER FOR US IN SOME SENSE COMPARED TO THE CRAP QUALITY TESTING RULES. AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FLEET AND OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR SISTER PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NOT A PRODUCT OUT IN THE MARKETPLACE. THAT PUTS CALIFORNIA'S AT RISK FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. SO AS YOU MENTIONED WE HAVE A NORTHERN MANAGEMENT AREA AND THIS IS UP YOU KNOW FOR BRAG USE ALL AREA AND WHAT WE HAVE. AS A NEED THERE IS TO GET ONE ADDITIONAL CLEAN TEST THE CLEAR AND AVOID ANY DEMO LIKE ACID DELAYS IN THE NORTHERN MANAGEMENT AREA. AND I BELIEVE THE RESULTS ARE EXPECTED NOVEMBER TWENTY SECOND. SO THEN% KIND OF MOVING SOUTHWARD WE HAVE A CENTRAL MANAGEMENT AREA AND THIS IS AROUND THE DUXBURY REEF POINT REYES AREA YOU MENTIONED IT. ON NOVEMBER FIFTH WE HAD A SAMPLE OF ONE CRAB OVER THE LIMIT WE IN OUR PARLANCE KIND OF SHORT HANDED SAY A HOT CRAP IT'S OVER THE THRESHOLD OF THIRTY SIX PARTS PER MILLIMETER. MILLION AND SO WE HAVE SINCE THAT NOVEMBER FIFTH SAMPLE OF A HOT CROWD WE HAVE OUR FIRST REQUIRED CLEAN SAMPLE THE CAME IN LATE LAST WEEK. AND WE NEED ONE ADDITIONAL CLEAN SAMPLE BEFORE WE CAN OPEN THE AREA SO THESE ARE RULES AROUND OPENING CLOSING BASED ON THE TESTING. WE COLLECTED OUR SECOND SET A SAMPLES YESTERDAY ON MONDAY THE EIGHTEENTH. WE'VE DELIVERED THEM TO OUR SISTER AGENCIES LAB WE HAVE SOME INTERNAL PROTOCOLS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN IS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE HITTING ALL OF OUR PROCESSING MARKERS TODAY AND TOMORROW. FOR EXPEDITED REVIEW AND WHAT WE'VE TOLD THE ENTIRE FLEET I BELIEVE THE MEDIA AND EVERYBODY ELSE IS WATCHING. IS WE'RE GONNA PROVIDE NOTIFICATION NO LATER THAN SIX PM TOMORROW. ABOUT THIS LAST SAMPLE AND WE BASICALLY COULD END UP WITH THREE SCENARIOS AND WE'VE ALSO KIND OF BROADCAST THESE LIKELY SCENARIOS THE FLEET SO THEY CANNOT PLANNING CERTAINTY AS MUCH AS THAT'S AVAILABLE IN THIS CLIMATE. ONE SCENARIO IS THE SAMPLE COMES BACK CLEAN. WE'VE GOT AN OPENING WE'RE GOOD TO GO. ANOTHER SCENARIO IS THE SAMPLES WE CAN'T GET THEM PROCESSED AGAINST THE SIX PM MARKER. THE MACHINE COULD BREAK DOWN. YOU KNOW SOME OTHER ACT OF GOD COULD INTERVENE AND WE JUST CAN'T GET THEM PROCESS OKAY SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE HITTING ALL OF OUR INTERNAL MARKERS FOR OUR EXPEDITED APPROACH. AND UNDER THIS CAN'T GET IT PROCESS THE SAMPLE RESULTS AREN'T AVAILABLE BY SIX O'CLOCK TOMORROW. YOU COULD SEE A COUPLE OF KIND OF SUBSTANCE AREAS WE WOULD BE DELAYING THE OPENER IN AN AREA FROM PILLAR POINT TO POINT RACES. FAIR START WOULD BE INVOKED AND THEN AT A SUBSEQUENT MOMENT WE MIGHT EITHER BE ABLE TO SAY THE SAMPLE IS COME BACK CLEAN. IF THAT WERE THE CASE WOULD STILL APPLY SEVENTY TWO HOUR NOTICE TO THE FLEET. FOR PRE SOAK IN CERTAIN AREAS OR THAT SAMPLE COULD COME BACK HOT. IT COMES BACK HOT THEN WE NEED TO CONSECUTIVE WEEKS OF CLEAN SAMPLES BEFORE WE CAN OPEN AND WE WOULD ALSO BE USING THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR NOTICE- FOR PRE SOAK- INFORMATION. AND THE LAST SCENARIO. IS BY SIX O'CLOCK TOMORROW WE PROCESS THE SAMPLE AND IT COMES BACK ABOUT THE LIMIT TAUGHT. AT WHICH POINT WE WOULD DELAY IN THE AREA FROM PILLAR POINT OF POINT REYES AND WE WOULD HAVE FAIR START INVOKED AND THEN WE WOULD NEED TWO CONSECUTIVE WEEKS OF CLEAN SAMPLES REQUIRED WE WOULD AGAIN GIVE SEVENTY TWO HOUR NOTICE ONCE WERE READY TO OPEN FOR PRE SO. THAT'S A LOT. IT'S PARTICULARLY A LOT FOR THE AVERAGE CITIZEN WHO'S LISTENING. IT'S FAMILIAR FOR THOSE OF US THAT ARE IN THIS INTENSE SPACE- BUT I'M SYMPATHETIC FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC THIS TRYING TO TRACK WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. SO THE LAST SET OF RULES THAT ARE ACTUALLY THE NEWEST FOR US IN SOME SENSE AND ARGUABLY THEIR THE LEAST PREDICTABLE. SET OF RULES AROUND THE OPENING FACTOR OUR MARINE LIFE ENTANGLEMENTS. IT'S BEEN WELL DISCUSS YOU'VE HOSTED SEVERAL WORKSHOPS AND HEARINGS ABOUT IT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS. WE CHERISH OUR ICONIC MARINE MAMMALS THAT ARE OFF OUR SHORE. AND WE HIGHLY VALUE A SUSTAINABLE DUNGENESS CRAB FISHERY AND I FOR ONE AM LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING A MOM MY THANKSGIVING PLACE. THE DEPARTMENT IS IN THE MIDDLE OF ACHIEVING BOTH THOSE SCHOOLS. WE HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE THAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH FOR THE FIRST TIME. IT'S GOT SOME FLAWS IT'S NOT PERFECT BUT IT'S WORKING. WE'VE FACILITATED A WORKING GROUP OF EXPERTS ACROSS ALL THIS CONSTITUENTS INTERESTS BASE AND WE HAVE IDENTIFIED MOMENTS WHERE WERE CONVENING THEM WE'RE LOOKING AT BEST AVAILABLE INFORMATION WE'RE DOING A RISK ASSESSMENT AND THAT STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY GROUP IS ADVISING THE DEPARTMENT. ON WHETHER WE SHOULD OPEN THE SEASON OR DELAYED THIS SEASON BASED ON THE REST TO WELL ENTANGLEMENTS MARINE MAMMAL ENTANGLEMENTS SO ON NOVEMBER FIFTH BASED ON THIS STRUCTURED PROCESS. INFORMED BY RECOMMENDATIONS THE CAME FROM THAT GROUP AND ALL THE COMMENTS DURING A FORTY EIGHT HOUR WINDOW. I ANNOUNCED WE WERE GOING TO DO A SEVEN DAY DELAY. TO WELL RISK SOUTH OF THE MENDOCINO CINEMA COUNTY LINE. SO INSTEAD OF OPENING ON NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH. WE'RE NOW SET TO OPEN IN A COUPLE OF DAYS. AND WE HAVE OUR PRE SOAK READY TO START AT SIX AM ON THURSDAY NOVEMBER TWENTY FIRST. THE BASIS FOR THAT SEVEN DAY DELAY WAS WE COULD SEE A LARGE NUMBER F WHALES STILL OUT IN THE FISHING GROUNDS. WE DON'T HAVE A HISTORICAL RECORD IN THE SPACE TO TELL YOU IF THEY'RE MORE OR LESS PER SE WHAT WE CAN IDENTIFIES PRESENCE OR ABSENCE AND WE'RE SEEING. CONGREGATIONS STILL IN THE FISHING GROUNDS SO WE PUSH THIS DELAY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TIME FOR THE WHALES TO SWIM SOUTH ON THEIR MIGRATION YET. SECURING AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FLEET TO GET THE PRODUCT INTO THE THANKSGIVING MARKET WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT TRADITION PARTICULARLY HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO LET ME TELL YOU ONE LAST UPDATE AND THEN STOP. SO AT OUR DEPARTMENT THIS IS A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR US LEADING THIS KIND OF ADVISORY GROUP THROUGH STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING AROUND MARINE MAMMAL ENTANGLEMENTS. WE MADE A DECISION A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO GATHER INFORMATION SO YESTERDAY FIRST TIME WE'VE DONE THIS SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS REASON. WE PUT ONE OF OUR OWN DEPARTMENT PLANES IN THE AIR. ALONG WITH SOME QUALIFIED SCIENTIFIC OBSERVERS. HISTORICALLY WE'VE RELIED ON OTHER AGENCIES FLYING THEIR PLANES TO GATHER INFORMATION WE WANTED TO KEEP TRACK OF THE SITUATION SO I THINK THIS IS A POSITIVE STORY WE ARE COMMITTED TO REAL TIME MONITORING TO INFORM DECISION MAKING. WHAT ARE FOLKS LANDED YESTER DAY THEY LET US KNOW AT THE LEADERSHIP LEVEL THEY STILL SEE THE PRESENCE OF WALES NEAR THE GULF OF THE FOR AIRLINES THEY STILL SEE WHALES OFF POINT REYES AND SOME DOWN IN HALF MOON BAY. IN PARTS OF THE FISHING GROUNDS. SO WE KNOW THAT THERE'S CONTINUED PRESENCE OF THESE WELLS. AT THIS MOMENT WE DON'T THINK IT WARRANTS ANY ADDITIONAL DELAY WE'RE GOING TO STICK WITH THE OPENER. BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE ADVISING TODAY AND IN THE COMING DAYS IN VERY CLEAR TERMS. WE KNOW THE FLEA CAN FISH RESPONSIBLY THEY HAVE COMMITTED TO US THEY WILL FISH RESPONSIBLY WE EXPECT THE FLEET THE FISH RESPONSIBLE. WE'RE GOING TO KEEP OUR PLANE IN THE AIR AS MUCH AS THE WEATHER RESOURCES PILOT AVAILABILITY ALLOWS US. WE THINK WE COULD BE EVOLVING TO A FUTURE WHERE WE'RE GATHERING INFORMATION FROM THE AIR. AND WERE RELAYING IT TO SOME FORM OF UNIFIED COMMAND ON THE GROUND THAT'S ADVISING OUR PARTNERS IN THE FLEET WHERE THEY SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T GO WHAT THEY MAY AND MAY NOT WANT TO AVOID RELATIVE TO PRESENCE OF WALES WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO INVOLVED IN THAT KIND OF ADAPTABILITY. AND WE NEED TO FLEE TO THIS RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THEY KNOW IF WE HAVE AN ENTANGLEMENT. I HAVE A SERIES OF ADDITIONAL RISK ASSESSMENTS COMING UP AND I MAY CONCLUDE THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS TO CLOSE THE FISHERY PERMANENTLY FOR THE SEASON SO THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON ON THIS LAST PIECE OF INFORMATION. IT'S BEEN COMPLICATED EVERY YEAR OF MY EIGHT YEARS AS DIRECTOR ON CRAB OPENERS AND IS JUST GETTING MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE OF THESE THREE SETS OF RULES AND HOW THEY INTERFACE. NO THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A DRESS FROM STRUCTURE SO IT JUST PERSPECTIVE WEISS. HI THE ABSOLUTE STORM THAT WE SAW IN REGARDS TO THE WARM WATER INTO MùT GAS IT- BACK IN PERSPECTIVE I AND THEY WERE ALSO ASKED MR HE'S WELL. WERE IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE ON THE DEMO GAS AND LEVELS UNDERSTAND WE STILL HAVE SOME HOT TESTS OUT THERE BUT MUCH BETTER SHAPE. THAN WE WERE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IF YA CAN JUST QUICKLY- COMING ON THAT AND THEN I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ON- ON WHEELS I AGREE THAT GENERAL CHARACTERS STATION WHERE BETTER. WITH REGARDS TO DEMONIC ACID TODAY THAN WE WERE IN THE PEAK OF THE WARM WATER BLOOM AND THAT PRIOR. TO MARK ACID INCIDENT. I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT TOO. THANK YOU SO MUCH A- WALES AND THEN I'M ALSO GOING TO ASK A AND I KNOW WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM. A MISS ROBIN TIME AND MISS RIGHT WINE BUT HAVE A QUICK QUESTION FOR THEM AND OBVIOUSLY WILL HAVE YOU. MAKE YOUR PRESENTATION AS WELL O THAT MISTER DIRECTOR TALK A BIT ABOUT THE ISSUE ON WHALES- SO YOU YOU'D SAID THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A PLAN UP IN THE AIR. YOU'RE GONNA CONTINUOUSLY. ON THE OCEAN IS WELL WHAT WHAT TYPE OF BACK AND FORTH GOES- GOES ON BETWEEN YOUR DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS FLEETS. WE ARE IN REGULAR COORDINATION WITH THE FLEA AND THAT HAS BEEN TRUE FOR YEARS. WHAT I THINK WILL BE NEW IN THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR FORTY EIGHT HOURS SEVEN DAYS TEN DAYS. IS THIS IMPORTANT MANAGEMENT IDEA WE HAVE. IF WE CAN MARSHAL THE RESOURCES SWIMMING WEATHER DOESN'T KEEP US OUT OF THE YEAR AND WE'VE GOT PILOT AVAILABILITY WE'D LIKE TO GET UP IN THE AIR SO WE HAVE A GOOD VISUAL OF PRESENCE AND ABSENCES THE WELLS ARE MOVING SOUTH. WE DON'T YET KNOW AND I THINK LATER TODAY AND TOMORROW WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO HUDDLE WITH MR OPPENHEIM. HOW TO FIND A PRINCIPLE POINT OF CONTACT IN THE FLEET THAT'S ON THE GROUND. AND THEN USE THEIR PRETTY REGULAR COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN FISHING VESSELS WHILE THEY'RE OUT IN THE WATER. I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO PROBLEM SOLVING THE NEXT DAY OR TWO. SO BY THE TIME WE GET TO THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WE HAVE SOME. INFORMAL BUT BETTER STRUCTURE AROUND HOW TO RELAY INFORMATION BACK AND FORTH AND AGAIN ASSUMING WHETHER IN SEES- WE WILL ALSO LIKELY BE PUTTING SOME OF OUR PATROL BOATS ON THE WATER AND THAT'S AN ELEMENT OF COMMUNICATION CONNECTIVITY. NOT A ONE OF THE ASPECTS WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE IS. IF THE DATA. EXISTS. AT A FUTURE MAMA FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO FURTHER RESTRICT BECAUSE A MARINE MAMMAL ENTANGLEMENT WE'RE GONNAFALL THE WORKING GROUP PROCESS WE WANT THEIR ADVICE WE WANT TO CONSULT WITH THEM AND WHEN WE TAKE ADDITIONAL PROTECTIVE MEASURES WE ALSO ARE COGNIZANT OF DOING IT IN A WAY. THAT DOESN'T CREATE A PUBLIC SAFETY RISK. AND COGNIZANT OF AN ORDERLY FISHERY OUT IN THE WATER WHICH IS ANOTHER REASON WE NEED GOOD COMMUNICATION WITH THE FLEET. THANK YOU SO MUCH QUICKLY AND GO TO A MISTER OPPENHEIM IS RIGHT ONE SUGGEST THE ALL DON'T MIND TALK TO US ABOUT- LOOK FLEET HAS BEEN EXTREMELY PROACTIVE. IN REGARDS TO THE ISSUE OF ENTANGLEMENTS AND IMPLEMENTING THE RETRIEVAL PROGRAM YOU'RE THE ONE THAT CAME TO US AND SAID WE GOT TO MOVE ON THIS. AND THERE ARE VERY FEW INDUSTRIES IN THIS STATE THAT WOULD SAY REGULATE ASSN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING BECAUSE YOU ALL WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING SO TALK TO US ABOUT. THE CONDITIONS ON THE GROUND AND BEING ABLE TO HAVE THAT CONSECUENCIA FUEL MIND WITH THE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THEY KNOW THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT PRIORITY FOR YOUR MEMBERS. DROPPING ON THE GOING THIS ROUTE ONE PLEASE. THANK YOU CENTER WIRE AND LOOKING FOR TO FLUSHING THIS. ISSUE OUT EVEN MORE IN OUR- PREPARED REMARKS BUT JUST BRIEFLY ON THIS CONCEPT- WHICH IS A NEW ONE I'VE- BEEN IN TOUCH WITH OUR LEADERSHIP JUST THIS MORNING ABOUT. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT KIND OF SPATIAL AWARENESS AND CERTAINLY DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER AT THIS VERY MOMENT BUT THE CONVERSATION IS GOING ON CERTAINLY AT FIRST BLUSH. THE NOTION THAT KNOWING WHERE WELLS ARE LOCATED IN REAL TIME IS AN ASSET. IT'S A NEW KIND OF INFORMATION AND WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL THAT THE WAY THAT WE ARE APPROACHING MANAGEMENT ON THE WATER THIS YEAR'S NEW AS THE DIRECTOR NOTED IN HIS TESTIMONY IT IS IT IS A NEW APPROACH. AND WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT WE ARE USING THIS AS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE- AND AS WE GATHER MORE INFORMATION. ABOUT HOW HOW WE CAN USE SPATIAL DATA. WE CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT WHAT THAT MEANS ON THE WATER FOR FISHERMEN BUT I THINK IN GENERAL- WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO EXPLORING THIS CONCEPT. YEAH I WOULD IMAGINE IT'LL TURN OVER MISS FRONTLINE IN JUST ONE MOMENT IS THAT- YOU'RE GONNA BEING CONSEQUENT CASE FROM THE DEPARTMENT RIGHT- IN ENSURING THAT THERE IS A PROACTIVE APPROACH. TO THIS ISSUE- UNDERSTAND THAT CONDITIONS HAVE CHANGED I IN YOUR ALL ADAPTING BUT YOU'RE ADAPTING I KNOW THAT THIS IS COMING. CAN BE VERY PROACTIVE I WOULD ASSUME I IN THAT COMMUNICATION IN TRYING TO AVOID I'M IN AREAS WHERE YOU MAY SEE. IT ON THIS TO WALES FOR EXAMPLE WITHOUT QUESTION THE NOTION THAT FISHERMEN WOULD BE ABLE TO RESPOND- IN IN REAL TIME IS A COMPLEX ONE BUT WITHOUT QUESTION FISHERMEN WILL USE THIS INFORMATION AS BEST THEY POSSIBLY CAN. FISHMAN ARE GOOD AT MOVING HERE- IT IS HOWEVER AT A TEDIOUS PROCESS WITH EQUITY ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH SCALE OF OPERATION ETCETERA. SO IT WILL BE COMPLEX BUT THIS IS A SWEET. KNOWN FOR ITS INGENUITY AND THAT'S- DESIRE TO NAVIGATE THE SITUATION EFFECTIVELY. THANK YOU SO MUCH REVEREND MISS FRONTLINE IN- THEN WE'LL GO TO- WESC IF THERE'S INCLUDING COMING FROM THE DIRECTION OF A GOOD MYSTERY BUT PLEASE DESTROY. THANK YOU SENATOR- JUST TO ADD AND BUILD ON TO- BUT NO I HAS PRESENTED SO FAR- WE WOULD CONCUR AND I WOULD ADD TO THAT. THAT ONE OF THE RESPONSIBLE THINGS THAT THE CALIFORNIA COAST CRAP ASSOCIATION IS DOING. IS AN INITIATIVE CALLED OUR SLACK LINE INITIATIVE AND THAT IS SOMETHING WHERE WE REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF LINE TO THE BILL E. IN OUR ACTUAL FISHING OPERATIONS. IN THAT REALLY HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN THE LONG IN THE LONG RUN TO REDUCE INTERACTIONS SO AGREEING THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES IN TERMS OF THE COMMUNICATION I THINK THE- ESTABLISHING THIS SORT OF POINT OF COMMUNICATION IS SOMETHING THAT. WE COULD DEFINITELY ASSIST WITH THROUGH OUR ASSOCIATION AND AGAIN WE'RE BEING PROACTIVE WITH OUR. SLACK LINE INITIATIVE YEAH I PRECIADO THANK YOU SIMPLY. I'M GONNA TURN OVER THE DIRECTOR FOR ANY CLOSING COMMENTS AND JUST. ONE LAST THING FOR ME IS THAT SO. PLAN IS THIS. YOU'RE GONNA BE HAVING HER WITH THE FLEET LEADERSHIP TODAY WE'RE ALL GONNA KNOCK ON WOOD AT FOLKS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT ON THE WATER ON THE TWENTY SECOND. I AND THEN THE PLAN WOULD BE IS. PENDING CONDITIONS YOU'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT FLIGHTS ABOUT. YOU'RE GONNA BE TO PAULINE- DEPARTMENT VESSELS ON THE WATER WHERE YOU KNOW THAT THERE MAY BE SOME- HIDES AND THEN THERE'S GOING TO BE THE REAL TIME COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE FLEET IN SEEING WHAT THEY'RE SEEN ON THE GROUND- AND ON THE OCEAN IS WELL WHEN MAKE SURE THAT'S ACCURATE BECAUSE THAT SOUNDS. LIKE A HECK OF A PLAN IN GRATEFUL FOR THAT IN RESPONDING RIGHT TO THESE CHANGED CONDITIONS PLEASE FILL IN ONE INNING I MAY MISS ANY CLOSING COMMENTS. ONLY TO ADDITIONAL THINGS- THE FLEET IS TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE SIX PM MARKER TOMORROW. FOR THE DEMO LIKE ACID IF WE GET A CLEAN WE'RE GOOD FOR HOT AND WILL HAVE VARIATIONS PLAY OUT. SECOND AS WE GET INTO THE FIRST PART OF DECEMBER WE WILL BE CONVENING ARE ADVISORY GROUP AROUND THE WHALE ISSUE. AND WE THEN WILL THROUGH DECEMBER HAVE DIFFERENT RISK ASSESSMENT MOMENTS. WHERE WILL DELIBERATE AND THEN INFORM THE PUBLIC WHAT THOSE RISK ASSESSMENTS LOOK LIKE. IT'S GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER TO REFER THAT YOU'RE HERE TODAY THANK YOU. WE'RE NOT GONNA BE TURNED OVER TO- BITS AND HE- HE RUNS THE FOOD AND DRUG BRANCH OF THE CABIN PART IN A PUBLIC HEALTH. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU MYSTERY IN HIS TEAM. A BEING EXTREMELY PROACTIVE AND RESPONDING QUICK STYLE- ON ALL ISSUES RELATED TO THE TESTING IT IS NOT BEEN EASY THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED. OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS SEE IF FIVE MINUTES NOT TURN OF YOU SIR IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR THE INVITATION TODAY AND AS YOU STATED ON CHIEF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOOD DRUG BRANCH AND I'M HERE TODAY PROVIDE EVERYBODY AN UPDATE. ON THE POST HARPER DEMOTE ACID TESTING. FOCUSING ON CRABS. IN OUR DEPARTMENT THERE ARE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS THAT WORK CLOSELY TOGETHER. TO MONITOR THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS AND RISK OF HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS. IN THE OCEAN AND THE TOXINS THEY MAY PRODUCE. THEIR BAR MULTIMETER ANCHE. MONITORS BLOOM CONDITIONS IN THE OCEAN AND POTENTIAL PRE HARVEST RISKS WHILE THE FOOD DRUG BRANCH WHERE I WORK. MONTRES POSTHARVEST RISK IMPACT ON SEAFOOD PRODUCTS HEADING TO CONSUMERS. AND THEN WE WORK WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT IS THE FOOD DRUG LABORATORY FRANCE WHICH PERFORMS DOG DEMOTE ACID TESTING ON FISH AND SHELLFISH. AS YOU MAY KNOW THE MORE GAS IT IS A TOXIN PRODUCED BY CERTAIN PHYTOPLANKTON. AN OCEAN LEVELS INCREASES DURING BLOOMS THAT OCCUR AT SOMETIMES. THE CONDITIONS THAT RESULTS IN THE FINAL PLANKTON BLOOM MORE COMPLEX BUT ARE THOUGHT TO INCLUDE CURRENT NUTRIENT LEVELS CURRENTS WARMING OCEAN TEMPERATURES AMONG OTHERS. THE TOXIN CAN ACCUMULATE IN SHELLFISH THAT CONSUMED THE FINAL COLLECTING AND THEN CAN CAUSE ILLNESS IN HUMANS AS WELL AS MARINE MAMMALS AND BIRDS THAT CONSUME THE SHELLFISH. IN HUMANS THIS CAN RANGE FROM MILD GASTROINTESTINAL ILLNESS TO SEVERE SYMPTOMS THAT MAY INCLUDE PERMANENT LOSS OF SHORT pAS AMNESIC SHELLFISH POISONING. OTHERS CAN ALSO CAUSE COMA AND OR EVEN DEATH. THE DEPARTMENT IN COORDINATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND THE INDUSTRY HAS BEGUN PRE SEASON TESTING FOR TOMORROW CAST IN DUNGEONS CRABS. AND WE'VE BEEN WATCHING THE DATA COME IN AND HOPING TO SEE ALL OF SAMPLE POINTS BELOW THE ACTION LEVELS. UNFORTUNATELY AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER WE HAVE TWO AREAS WHERE THE SAMPLES HAVE TESTED ABOVE THE THIRTY PARTS PER MILLION ACTION LEVEL. OFFERS SUMMARIZE THE RESULTS BEEN PROVIDE AN UPDATE TO THE CURRENT ADVISORIES IN EFFECT. AS OF TODAY PRESEASON TEST RESULTS OF DUNGEONS CRAP FROM NORTH TO SOUTH CHAU CRESCENT CITY ALL CRABS BELOW THE ACTION LEVEL. TRINIDAD ALL CROWD BELOW ACTION LEVEL EUREKA ALL CROWD BELOW THE ACTION LEVEL. FORT BRAGG EXCEED ACTION LEVEL. THE DATABASE AFTER TWO ROUNDS A RESAMPLING ALL CRIMES ARE BELOW THE ACTION LEVEL. HALF MOON BAY AT SAN FRANCISCO 70% OF THE SAMPLES FROM DUXBURY EXCEED THE ACTION LEVEL. MONTEREY ALL CRABS BELOW THE ACTION LEVEL MORAL BAY ALL CRABS BELOW THE ACTION LEVEL. AS A REMINDER THE ACTION LEVEL FOR DEMOTE ACID IN CRAP IS GREATER THAN THIRTY PARTS PR MILLION IN INTERNAL ORGANS VYSERA OR GUTS IF YOU MAY. AND IS TWENTY PARTS PER MILLION IN THE MEAT. EVEN IN PRE SEASON TESTING WHEN A LOCATION COMES BACK WITH THE NEXT SEASON'S WE REQUIRE TWO SETS. TO CLEAN SETS OF SAMPLES- SEVEN DAYS APART TO REMOVE AN ADVISORY. ADVISORIES ARE CURRENTLY IN EFFECT FOR THE FOLLOWING DUNGENESS CRAB FORT BRAGG- USE ALL THEIR SHELTER COVE HUMBOLDT COUNTY TO POINT ARENA THIS AREA STILL UNDER ADVISORY PENDING RETEST ROUND ONE RETEST SAMPLE SET- FROM TEN TWENTY NINE. HAD PASS IN THE SECOND SAMPLE SAID IS EXPECTED. TO BE COMPLETED- HOPEFULLY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. DON'T DO THIS CRAP- SERVICES GOING DUXBURY POINT REYES TO POLLUTE POINT AS% YOU WERE THE NATIONAL SAMPLE- DID NOT PASS. ROUND ONE RETEST ALSO DID NOT PASSED AROUND TO THE FOR SAMPLES THAT PASSED. ROUND TWO SECOND SAMPLE SAID- ARE EXPECTED- TOMORROW- SO WE PLAN TO GET THAT OUT RIGHT AWAY IF THERE ARE NO UNEXPECTED- ADVANCE THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE- WE HA. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH I WANTED TO PAY THAT DUXBURY- DELAY. EVEN WHEN THE STATUS WILL BOB RITTERMAN AND COMMUNICATED TO THE FLEET WITH THAT BY THE SIX EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HOURS OR SIX O'CLOCK WEDNESDAY. ROCK CRAB ANOTHER ADVISORIES ARE UPDATES ARE ROCK CRAP CAUGHT IN THE STATE WATERS AROUND SANTA ROSA. ISLAND NORTHERN CHANNEL ISLANDS IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. ROCK CRAP FROM MISSY NO HUMBOLDT COUNTY LINE NEAR CAPE MENDOCINO HUMBOLDT COUNTY. ROCK CRAB FROM THE NORTH JETTY OF HUMBLE BAY ENTRANCE TO THE CALIFORNIA OREGON BORDER. THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE HAVE BEEN MAINTAINING ONGOING EFFORT WITH THE VOLUNTEERS AND INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE SAMPLES AS PART OF THE DEMONIC ACID MONITORING AND AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE SLIDE- THE SAMPLING IS. PRETTY COMPLICATED PROCESS. BUT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE INDUSTRY SUPPORT AND IT'S BEEN CRITICAL AND I REPEAT CRITICAL IN OBTAINING ADDITIONAL SAMPLES. OF THE IMPACTED AREA SO OUR DEPARTMENT CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION TO THE POTENTIAL RISKS TO PUBLIC HEALTH. WE WISH TO THANK. THEM PUBLICLY FOR THE HARD WORK IN THE SUPPORT THEY PROVIDE. OUR DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO POST RESULTS ON OUR WEBSITE THE PUBLIC CAN CONDUCT A SEARCH INTERNET SEARCH UNDER FOOD DRUG BRANCH DEMOC ACID OR C. PH TO MARK ACID. AND IN CLOSING I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND INVITING US HERE TODAY. REALIZE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OUR ACTIONS AND I'M AWARE I'M HERE TO REAFFIRM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH- COMMITMENT TO WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR PARTNER AGENCIES. FISHERMEN AND ASSOCIATED INDUSTRY AND THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE TIMELY AND RELEVANT INFORMATION AND TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF THE PUBLIC WHO CONSUME THIS CALIFORNIA COMMODITY. DURING THIS HOLIDAY SEASON AND THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU SEE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT AND I THINK WE'RE ALL GONNA KNOCK ON WOOD RIGHT NOW- AND THAT. WE HAVE SOME CLEAN TEST COMPANY SO AGAIN. WILL SAVE TRENDS HAVE BEEN GOOD- BUT UNDRSTAND THAT WE HAD THE WITCHING HOUR TOMORROW AT SIX O'CLOCK THAT IS CORRECT ALL RIGHT. THERE WE GO THANK YOU BREAKING HAVE BEEN. IS YOUR SON'S DAYTIME APPLE CIDER NOT CHAMPAGNE. IF WE GET IT SO WATCH OUT. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR THANK YOU IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE AN PLEASE A PESAR THANKS TO THE TEAM AS WELL. AS YOU GUYS HAVE REALLY BEEN WORKING HARD WITH A DEPARTMENT FISH WILDLIFE WILL DO THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WE'RE NOT GOING TO TURN IT ON TO THE ENVIRONMENT PROGRAM MANAGER- THERE AT THE PROVINCIAL LIFE THANK YOU MASTER. HE'S GOING TO BE TALKING TO US ABOUT THE WORKING GROUP THAT YOU'VE HEARD IN REGARDS TO- WHALES IN TRYING TO EVALUATE THE RISK OF MARINE LIFE AND TACKLE MAKING CANDIDLY. HOW WE DON'T. GET INTO THE CHALLENGES WITH ENTANGLEMENT AS WELL HE'S GONNA BE TALKING TO US ABOUT RULE MAKING- AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENTS ON THE CONSERVATION PLAN. IN OF COURSE SAID INCIDENTAL TAKE PERMIT ALTERNATE. OVER TO SAKE FOR HIS REPORT IF I'M ANSWER. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING. YEAH I'D PROVIDE A SHORT UPDATE ON OUR EFFORTS TO THE WORKING GROUP IN THE DEPARTMENT ON THE CONSERVATION PLAN- ULTIMATELY TO GET THE IN N. H. I. INCIDENTAL TAKE PERMIT. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL AGENCY. TO IDENTIFY THE TARGETS UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE LIKELY TO APPROVE. AND THEN OF COURSE IS PART OF THAT REQUIREMENT IS TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS SUCH THAT WHEN WE- IMPLEMENT THE CONSERVATION PLAN UNDER THE I. T. P. WE THE DEPARTMENT CAN ACTUALLY. PROMULGATE THAT ACTIVITY THROUGH RULES SO. AS YOU'VE HEARD WE SHARED WITH THE WORKING GROUP IN SEPTEMBER OUR TRASH- REGULATORY PROPOSAL TO BUILD THAT. A MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK WE'VE GOT SOME GREAT INPUT FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS ON THAT WERE MAKING SOME MINOR MODIFICATIONS. WE HOPE TO- DISTRIBUTE A DRAFT PROPOSAL FOR THAT COMING LATE WINTER EARLY SPRING. ON OUR DRAFT PROPOSALS FOR THAT RULE MAKING THAT WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WILL BE THE GUIDING RULES AND AS YOU KNOW THE IT WILL REPLACE THE STATUTORY. STRUCTURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED TO MANAGE- MARINE LIFE ENTANGLEMENT SO IT'S A PRETTY IMPORTANT RULE MAKING TO PAY ATTENTION TO. WE ARE STILL DEVELOPING TOOLS TO HELP ASSESS RISK. ONE OF THE KEY THINGS IS THE MODELING WORK TO IDENTIFY TRENDS IN OCEAN CONDITIONS AND PARTICULARLY RELATED TO FORAGE AS WE SAW YESTERDAY OUR OBSERVERS BY PLANE- WELLS LOVE ANCHOVIES IT'S- IN THE WORKING GROUP PARLANCE THIS IS AN ANCHOVY YOU'RE NOT A CREEL YEAR. AND WHEN WE HAVE ANCHOVY YEARS THE HUMPBACKS IN PARTICULAR HANG AROUND LONGER AND TEND TO BE CLOSE TO SHORE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE ANCHOVIES THAT IS A HIGHER RISK ENVIRONMENT THAN WHAT WE WOULD CALL A CREEL YEAR WHICH TENDS TO KEEP THE WHALES FURTHER OFFSHORE. THOUGHT DEVELOPING THOSE TOOLS ARE GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AS WAS MENTIONED HERE EARLIER ONE OF OUR GOALS IS TO GIVE THE FLEET SOME SENSE OF PREDICTABILITY SO THEY CAN MAKE THEIR DECISIONS RATHER THAN THE POTENTIAL CHAOS OF AT THE LAST MINUTE KNOWING WHERE THEY CAN GO FISH SO THAT'S A LONG TERM PROJECT. THE OTHER THING AS- SUSAN ROCKLINE POINTED OUT IS HOW TO FISH. WITH GEAR OR METHODS THAT JUST WON'T CATCH WHALES. SO WHETHER IT'S GETTING RID OF SLACK LINE WHICH THERE'S A LOT OF SUSPICION IS CERTAINLY CONTRIBUTES TO ENTANGLEMENT- WERE INVESTIGATING AS YOU KNOW ROLL BLISS TECHNOLOGIES THERE STILL A WAYS OUT I BELIEVE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT WORKING WITH INNOVATORS THE FISHERMAN WAS ALSO POINTED OUT THERE VERY INNOVATIVE BUNCH. WERE TRYING TO FACILITATE THEIR INNOVATION- THROUGH PROGRAMS TO GET TESTING OUT ON THE WATER THIS SEASON. TO HELP DEVELOP LESS WELL STICKY GEAR- AND I THINK I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT UNLESS THERE'S ANY PARTICULAR QUESTIONS REST OF TALK ABOUT- THIS IS GONNA BE AN ISSUE NOT JUST HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THROUGHOUT THE WEST COAST IN JUST ENHANCE COORDINATION FOR EXAMPLE. ON THE SPECIFIC ISSUE- WITH ORGAN IN WASHINGTON IS CAME UP AT THE COMMISSION MEETING THAT WE ARE AT AND I THINK THE IMPORTANCE OF IT HAVE UNIFORM STANDARDS I WANT TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH. BUT I CAN'T CHOCOLATE ABOUT THAT YES SURE. FOR A FEW YEARS NOW- BECAUSE THE TRISTATE WHALES POPPED UP ON THAT- AGENDA COUPLE YEARS AGO- TO BE FRANK IT FIRST OREGON WASHINGTON REALLY THINK THEY HAD A WEL PROBLEM UNTIL THEY DID. AND SO THEY- AS A RESULT OF THAT WE FORMED A MUCH STRONGER PARTNERSHIP WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER. THROUGH ROUTINE- CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT METHODS ARE LOOKING AT REGULATIONS. OREGON WASHINGTON ARE BOTH LOOKING AT POT LIMITS. DURING HIGH RISK PERIODS WHERE THEY WOULD REDUCE THE PERCENT OF GEAR THAT EACH PERMIT HOLDER CATFISH. AS A WAY TO REDUCE LINES IN THE WATER- THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT A SPECIAL PERMIT FOR THOSE ONE A FISSION THE SPRING TIME THAT WOULD. LIMIT THE NUMBER OF FISHERMEN AND GEAR SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT ALL KINDS OF TECHNIQUES. WASHINGTON REQUIRES A RECREATIONAL FISHERY TO CARRY UNIQUE BUT WE ON THEIR GEAR. OUT WE'RE BORROWING THAT PROPOSING TO BAR THAT FOR RECREATIONAL FISHERY BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT. AND ULTIMATELY WHAT I THINK THE TAKE PERMIT RULE REQUIRES OF IS WE DON'T WANT UNIDENTIFIED GEAR. CLOSING OUR COMMERCIAL FISHERY SO AND THAT'S ONE OF THE PROPOSALS WERE GONNA BE ASKING THE COMMISSION LOOK AT IT IS A UNIQUE IDENTIFYING A MARK ON THE RECREATIONAL GEAR SO WE DON'T. INADVERTENTLY CLOSER COMMERCIAL HERE. MY LAST QUESTION TO BE ABLE TO HAVE IF YOU WILL THE PROGRAM WRAPPED UP IN. FORMALIZED HERE WHAT DO YOU THINK IN I IN REGARDS TO ALL ISSUES OF. THE RULE MAKING. HOW LONG YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO TAKE TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH. OUR HOPE IS TO HAVE THE RAMP RULE MAKING READY FOR NEXT SEASON THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE CRAB SEASON UHHUH WE AS YOU KNOW WE PLAN ON SUBMITTING A COMPREHENSIVE DRAFT CONSERVATION PLAN THIS MAY. WHICH WILL START THE FEDERAL PROCESSES OF REVIEW. SOUL I THINK THE BOTTOM END I SHOULD MENTION WERE. POSING TO HAVE THE FIRST RAMP RULE MAKING DONE FOR NEXT SEASON WERE CALLING THAT RAMP ONE POINT I'LL- WE KNOW WE'RE LIKELY TO HAVE TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS BASED ON THE FINAL VERSION OF THE CONSERVATION PLAN THE FEDERAL AGENCY PROS SO WE'LL DO A FOLLOW UP RULE MAKING TO IMPLEMENT ANY CHANGES. BUT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO GET AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE SO WE PLAN ON HAVING. MOST OF THE HEAVY LIFTING DONE BY THE NEXT SEASON AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE THANK YOU SO MUCH. OKAY NEXT UP OR TO SEE THANK YOU. I THINK EVER NOT ONLY MOVING FORWARD THE BILL TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM THOSE WHO REPRESENT THE FISHMAN THEMSELVES AND THAT'S GONNA BE SEASON RIGHT WINE IN NOAH OPPENHEIM. HIS ROUTE WINE IS A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA CAST CRAP ASSOCIATION- IT'S A NEWLY FORMED ASSOCIATION FOCUS ON NORTH COAST FISHERY. I AND SHE CAN TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SITUATION. IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE UPCOMING SEASON AS WELL AS- DOING LITTLE BIT OF A DEEPER DIVE RIGHT. ONLINE ISSUES OF WHALES OR DEMO CASSIDY SANDRA WE'RE GONNA TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO MISS RIGHT WINES FROM WHEN YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES AND WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEES GOOD TO SEE YOU AND THANK YOU. FOR MAKING THE TREK UP FROM HUMBLE COUNTY TRINIDAD DOWN SACRAMENTO THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY THIS MORNING. AND I JUST WANT TO PUT ONE CLICK. SLIDE UP ON THEIR. JUST SO I CAN REMEMBER THE PLACE I'M FROM A YOU'RE GOOD YOU'RE GOOD TO GO NEXT ONE UP. NEXT ONE UP. THERE YEAH. PERFECT AND THEN YOU GET A BLOW IT UP. I DAM. AGAIN THANK YOU AND WE APPRECIATE THE INVITATION IN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE YOU TODAY. I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE A STATEMENT TODAY ON BEHALF OF OUR CALIFORNIA COAST CRAB ASSOCIATION THAT WAS DRAFTED BY A PRESIDENT HE'S BUSY GETTING READY FOR CRAB SEASON AND COULDN'T ATTEND TODAY. AND I THINK OUR CRAB GOING TO BE READY BY THE FIFTEENTH. SO WITH THAT BEING SAID THE CALIFORNIA COAST CRAB ASSOCIATION- CC CA IS A NON PROFIT COMMERCIAL TRADE ORGANIZATION THAT IS FUNDED BY CRAB FISHERMEN CRAB BUYERS AND DONATIONS FROM LOCAL COASTAL COMMUNITY BUSINESSES. OUR MEMBERS ARE A DIVERSE GROUP OF DUNGEON AS CRAB BOAT OWNERS HIRED SKIPPERS CRAB BUYERS AND PROCESSORS. SEE SEE SEE A WAS FORMED AFTER THE OUT OF COURT SETTLEMENT IN THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY VERSUS CHUCK BONHAM IN THE DEPARTMENT. OUR INDUSTRY HAS BANDED TOGETHER TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT OUR MULTI MILLION DOLLAR A YEAR COMMERCIAL CRAB INDUSTRY THE PAYS THE BILLS WITH THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES IN OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES. WITHOUT A VIABLE CRAB FISHERY MOST OF US COULD SIMPLY NOT AFFORD TO CONTINUE ON. THE TERMS FOR FISHING UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. ARE AN OVER REACH THAT WILL RESULT IN A SEVERELY CRIPPLED CRAB FISHERY THESE TERMS INCLUDE UNREASONABLE AN INEFFECTIVE EXPENSIVE GEAR MODIFICATIONS CONSTANT CLOSURES WHICH MAY CAUSE A FISHERY COLLAPSE. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT OUR INDUSTRY HAS PROACTIVELY ADDRESSED WILL INTERACTIONS FOR YEARS BEFORE THIS LAWSUIT WITH VOLUNTARY MEASURES IN LEGISLATION THAT INCLUDES STRAPLINE GEAR MODIFICATIONS THE WORKING GROUP. AND THE LOS GEAR RETRIEVAL PROGRAM THESE MEASURES HAVE SUCCESSFULLY REDUCED CONFIRMED INTERACTIONS BETWEEN LISTED OF WILLS AND COMMERCIAL CRAB GEAR TO PRACTICALLY ZERO. RECENT STUDIES SUGGEST AN EXPONENTIAL INCREASE IN THE POPULATION OF HUMPBACK WHALES THAT MY GREAT ALONG OUR COAST IT IS BECOMING CLEAR THAT ARE FISHERIES MINIMAL INTERACTION WITH WHEELS IS HAVING LITTLE TO NO EFFECT ON THE ROBUSTLY GROWING POPULATIONS. THIS NEWS SHOULD BE CELEBRATED. NOT MET WITH DRACONIAN AND UNNECESSARY FISHING RESTRICTIONS. AS A MEMBER OF THE WILL WORKING GROUP MYSELF I'VE BEEN AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT PROCESS FOR UPCOMING SEASON. THE OTHER TWELVE INDUSTRY MEMBERS ON THE ON THE WORKING GROUP WHO ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF THE CC CA WERE CONCERNED LAST MONTH WHEN THE DIRECTOR DID NOT FOLLOW THE FINDING OF LOW RISK THAT WAS DETERMINED BY THE FULL GROUP INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT'S OWN SCIENCE TEAM AND THE MARINE MAMMAL EXPERTS FROM NOVA. INSTEAD CHOSE TO DELAY THE OPENING OF OUR SEASON BASED ON CONCERNS FROM THE MINORITY OPINION FROM THE NON GOVERNMENTAL ASSOCIATIONS. SEE SEE SEE A REQUEST THAT THE JOINT COMMITTEE ENCOURAGE THE DIRECTOR TO RESPECT AND FOLLOW THE RISK ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATION PROCESS SET FORTH IN THE WORKING GROUP'S GUIDELINES. AND MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON SCIENCE AND ECONOMIC CONCERNS AND NOT POLITICAL PRESSURE FROM NGOS. GOING FORWARD FISHERIES MANAGEMENT MUST BE ADAPTIVE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE DRAMATIC INCREASES IN MARINE MAMMAL POPULATIONS. THE DEPARTMENT MUST ALSO USE THE PRINCIPLE THAT GUIDES FISHERY Là OF THE NATION. THAT REGULATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS PLACED ON ANY FISHERY MUST BE IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO THE ACTUAL RISK TO THE LISTED SPECIES ENDS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THE COMMERCIAL FISHERY TO ITS COASTAL COMMUNITIES. SEE SEE SEE A HAS SUBMITTED A DETAILED PROPOSAL FOR FURTHER MITIGATING MARINE MAMMAL INTERACTIONS TO THE WORKING GROUP AND THE DEPARTMENT TO DATE WE HAVE RECEIVED NO FORMAL RESPONSE. WE HAVE OFFERED TO HELP FACILITATE WIDER AND MORE FREQUENT SERVICE AND WE HAVE ACCESS TO BOATS PLANES AND CREWS THAT COULD HOST THEM. WE ARE OURSELVES DESIGNING A RESEARCH STUDY USING OUR MEMBER VESSELS THAT WILL IMPROVE THE UNDERSTANDING OF FLEET DYNAMICS IN RELATION TO WILL MIGRATION. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER WE ARE ACTIVELY PROMOTING OUR SLACK LINE INITIATIVE THROUGHOUT THE FLEET. IT HAS BEEN PROVEN THAT REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF SLACK AND BELIEVE LINE'S GREATLY REDUCES THE POSSIBILITY OF INTERACTIONS WITH MARINE MAMMALS. WE HAVE ALSO PROPOSED MULTIPLE PRACTICAL GEAR MODIFICATIONS TO OPEN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE STATE THIS SPRING WHICH WILL BE CLOSED. BY THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT. THE SIMPLE GEAR MODIFICATIONS COULD BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE WILL NOT SERIOUSLY CHANGING HOW WE ALREADY FISH WERE BE COST PROHIBITIVE LIKE THE IMPRACTICAL AND HIGHLY EXPENSIVE WROBLEWSKI YEAR BEING PROMOTED BY NGOS. IN CONCLUSION WE ASK THAT THE JOINT FISHERIES COMMITTEE SUPPORT THE CRAB FISHING INDUSTRY IN THIS CRITICAL TIME. IN PARTICULAR WE ASK THAT ARE COASTAL SENATORS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS STAND UP FOR THEIR MANY CONSTITUENTS IN THE DOZENS OF COASTAL COMMUNITIES IN THEIR DISTRICTS. WE REQUEST THAT THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE ENCOURAGE THE DEPARTMENT AND DIRECTOR TO DO EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO SUPPORT THIS FISHERY AND WORK WITH OUR ORGANIZATION AS THE PRIMARY. FOCUS OF OURS IS OUR DUNGENESS CRAB SEASON. WE REQUEST THAT THE COMMITTEE THE DEPARTMENT AND THE DIRECTOR HELP SECURE A SEAT AT THE TABLE FOR OUR ORGANIZATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE IMPORTANT CONSERVATION PLAN AND IN INCIDENTAL TAKE PERMIT APPLICATION WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY GUIDE THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR FISHERY. FINALLY THAT THE DIRECTOR IN THE APARTMENT. MANAGE OUR SUSTAINABLE DUNGENESS CRAB FISHERY BASED ON OBJECTIVE SCIENCE AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS AGAIN THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING US IN TODAY'S TESTIMONY WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING PRODUCTIVELY WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE DEPARTMENT TO PRESERVE AND PROTECT OUR FUTURE FISHERY. THANK YOU THANKS SO MUCH FOR THROWING HOUSEHOLD QUESTIONS COMMENTS UNTIL WE HEAR FROM YOU TO YOU WE'RE NOW GOING TO TURN OVER TO KNOW OPPENHEIM THE EXECUTRIX OF THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATION- MISTER OFTENTIMES GIMME GIVEN US PERSPECTIVE ON SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT ARE OUT IN THE OCEAN AS WE ARE ABOUT TO OPEN. CRAB SEASON AND WILL ALSO BE FOCUSING ON SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WITH THESE DELAYS AS WELL MISS ROBIN I'M YOUR FIVE MINUTES THE FLOOR IS YOURS AND WILL OPEN IT UP AND ENTERTAIN- QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE AND FOR THE RECORD MY NAME'S NO OPPENHEIM AND I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS. OUR ORGANIZATION IS A NON PROFIT REPRESENTING FOURTEEN PORT AND SECTOR MARKETING ASSOCIATIONS FROM SANTA BARBARA CRESCENT CITY CALIFORNIA AND FOR FORTY THREE YEARS PC OF A HAS BEEN FIGHTING ON BEHALF OF WORKING FISHERMEN THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES AND THE RESOURCES ON WHICH THEY DEPEND TO PRESERVE THE PROSPERITY AND SUSTAINABILITY OF THIS INDUSTRY ACROSS MULTIPLE SECTORS. AND IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT TWENTY NINETEEN HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING YARS IN THIS ORGANIZATIONS HISTORY I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM WORKING ON THIS FISHERY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THAT TWENTY TWENTY IS BETTER NOT WORSE FOR THE CRAB FISHERY IN IN A MOMENT I'LL TALK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL. SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SETTLEMENT IN THE C. B. D. V. BOTTOM LITIGATION IN MARCH THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE OPERATION OF THE DENTURES CRAB FISHERY HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY FISHMAN WERE ABLE TO CELEBRATE A SMALL VICTORY THE SUMMERS THE PS SOME OF SEE FINALLY DISTRIBUTED HOT HARD FOUGHT FISHERY DISASTER FUNDS TO OUR MEMBERS IN THE CRAB FISHERY. WELL THANK YOU SENATOR REQUIRES WAS STAFF AT THE DEPARTMENT OF. FISH AND WILDLIFE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC. ADMINISTRATION THE PACIFIC STATES MARINE FISHERIES COMMISSION AND A FEW KEY MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION AND THEIR STAFF FOR SECURING THESE FUNDS. THEY WERE CRITICAL PART OF- THE BOTTOM LINE FOR HUNDREDS OF FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES THIS YEAR BUT TO MANY THESE DISASTER FUNDS COMING MORE THAN THREE YEARS AFTER THE INITIAL DISASTER AT PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR. WE'RE SMALL COMFORT GIVEN THE NEW CHALLENGES WERE FACING. SAYS OF OPENING THE DUNGEONS CRAB FISHERY IS THAT CHALLENGE THIS-IS BECOME A GORDIAN KNOT OF INTERACTING REGULATORY PROCESS SEES. THAT A FISHERMAN ON PINS AND NEEDLES EVERY DAY. IN THE CHALLENGES GET MORE MORE SERIOUS AS MORE MORE LAYERS OF UNCERTAINTY ARE ADDED. STAFF AND LEADERSHIP OF THE MARINE REGION OF CDS W. IN AT CITY PA TO VOTE DEVOTED A GREAT DEAL OF TIME AND ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE. THEY WIN WORKING LONG HOURS AND SOME OVER THE WEEKEND TO ENSURE THAT THE DEMO GUESSES ACID TESTING THAT IS OCCURRING AS WE SPEAK. GO BY THE BOOK AND I WANT TO EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE TO THEM WE'RE ON A PATH TO OPENING THIS FISHERY THIS WEEK. AND I AND MY COLLEAGUES KNOW THAT THE INDUSTRY WILL TAKE GREAT CARE WHILE ENSURING THAT THE PUBLIC CRAB RESOURCES WILL BE ENJOYED Y THE PEOPLE. LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THANKSGIVING CRAB. ON DINNER PLATES IN THE MARKET BUT I'M ALSO LOOKING AT THE SERIES OF DECISIONS THAT FISH AND WILDLIFE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND OTHER AGENCIES WILL. BE MAKING AS WE PROCEED AND I THINK THERE ARE FOUR KEY NEEDS- THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS FIRST WE MUST AND DESIGN FLEXIBILITY INTO THE STATE'S INCIDENTAL TAKE PERMITS. FOR THIS AND OTHER FIX YOUR FISHERIES THAT MEANS WE MUST USE MOVING AVERAGES OF IMPACTS PROTECTED MARINE MAMMAL STOCKS WE MUST UPDATE THRESHOLDS TO REFLECT THE RECOVERY OF THE STOCKS. GETTING THEIR MEANS STRONGLY ENCOURAGING THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE TO RESOLVE THE KEY ISSUE REGARDING THE INTERACTION OF THE TWO OVER ARCHING FEDERAL STATUTES GUIDING THIS PROCESS. AND TO CONDUCT A LONG OVERDUE UPDATE TO THEIR LARGE MARINE MAMMAL STOCK ASSESSMENTS. SECOND WE MUST ENSURE THAT THE WORKING GROUP. IS ABLE TO MAKE SURGICAL RECOMMENDATIONS IN RESPONSE TO ANY IN SEASON ACTION TAKEN TO REDUCE ENTANGLEMENT RISK. AND REOPEN ANY CLOSED AREAS AS EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE WHICH IS REQUIRED IN SENATE BILL THIRTEEN OH NINE. THIRD WE MUST SEE COST EFFECTIVE GEAR MODIFICATIONS FOR THIS UPCOMING SEASON AS WELL AS FUTURE SEASONS. I THANK THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL- FOR LAYING OUT A GOOD PATH OF THIS APPROACH IN ITS PROPOSED TO TEACH YOU PLAN BY HIGHLIGHTING COOPERATIVE RESEARCH. AS THE IDEAL APPROACH HERE AS THEY PROPOSE COOPERATIVE RESEARCH WILL BE CHANNELED THROUGH THE WORKING GROUP I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT SUPPORT COMING FROM THIS PROCESS BE USED TO PRIORITIZE TESTING IN IMPLEMENTING READILY AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES. RATHER THAN SUBSIDIZING THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW GEARS LIKE POP UP SYSTEMS. AND FOURTH WE MUST EXPAND THE SCOPE OF PROTECTIONS TO MARINE LIFE TO OTHER SECTORS AND I'M PLEASED TO SEE THAT WE BEGUN EMBARKING ON THAT PATH HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHETHER IT'S THE RECREATIONAL SECTOR. OFFSHORE ENERGY IMPACTS TO MARINE MAMMALS SHIPPING OR PURSUIT OF MARINE MAMMALS IN TOURIST INDUSTRIES- RESPONSIBLE MITIGATION OF RISK MUST BE SHARED ACROSS SECTORS AND WE'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON THAT. RESPONDING TO THE ESSAY IS NOTHING NEW TO THIS FISHING INDUSTRY. IN THE CASE OF A CALIFORNIA DUNGEONS CRAB FISHERY RISING TO THIS CHALLENGE MEANS UNITING IN COMMON PURPOSE TO ACHIEVE THE MOST FAVORABLE I TT POSSIBLE. THE FIGHT ANY FUTURE LEGAL CHALLENGES TO THE STATE'S PROGRESS AND TO WORK WITH YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE AND OTHER LEADERS IN THE STATE INCLUDING- DIRECTOR BONHAM AND THE PUBLIC OF COURSE TO REMIND THEM OF THE VALUETHAT BIBLE OR SHOULD FISHERIES BRING TO THEM. WHILE ENSURING THAT WE CAN HAVE IT BOTH WAYS WE CAN PROTECT WHALES. SEA TURTLES AND WE CAN PROTECT COMMERCIAL FISHING COMMUNITIES. FURTHER CALIFORNIA FISHERIES IN ANOTHER WEST COAST STATES THE ROAD AHEAD IS LESS CLEAR THE RIGHT NOW WE ARE OUT IN FRONT OF A MASSIVE TRANSITIONAL PROCESS TAKING PLACE WE MUST TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY. BECAUSE WE DESIGN A PATH FOR THAT IS INFLEXIBLE AND IT FAILS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE RECOVERY MARINE MAMMAL STOCKS WE WILL FAIL TO ACHIEVE THE BALANCE WE NEED TO ENSURE. THAT FISHING COMMUNITIES AND MARINE LIFE CAN PROCESS WE MUST APPROACH THESE ISSUES IN A REASON AND COORDINATED WAY AND SOON THE CONSEQUENCES OF FAIING TO ORGANIZE OUR ALL TOO CLEAR TO ALL OF US. WITH YOUR HELP SENATOR WE'RE GOING TO WORK TO GET TO TACKLE THIS INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING ISSUE. FOR THE SAKE OF OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES AND YOU CAN. ONCE WE MUST. TRUMP AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THROWING THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK TO BETTER DIRECT OF ONE OF THE ITEMS THAT- I NAY PARAPHRASE HERE FROM A STRUGGLING TO THE DIRECTOR HERE AND TO BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON IN THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THERE'S GOING TO BE REPRESENTATION IN INTERACTION ON THE WAY WORKING GROUP- WITH AT BOTH ORGANIZATIONS. AS YOU MOVE FORWARD ONLINE AT THE STATE PERMIT THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BE TO GO TO THE FEDS WITH I SOON IT IS GOING TO BE SOME INTERACTION- WITH- EACH ASSOCIATIONS ULTIMATELY IT'S GOING TO BE THE DEPARTMENTAL DECISION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO BE ABLE TO DO THE FINAL BUT CAN YOU JUST TALK TO US ABOUT THAT AND HOW THAT OUT REACH WOULD LOOK LIKE. AS YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH THE- STATE PERMIT. OF COURSE THEY'LL BE A RICH. WE NEED THE INPUT FROM ALL OF THE EXPERTS WHETHER THEY'RE IN THE COMMERCIAL FLEET SECTOR. AARON ACADEMIA OR THAT UP OR THEY MIGHT BE IN OUR SISTER FEDERAL AGENCY THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE. SO THE OTHER THING I'D SAY IS LISTENING TO MISS ROUTE ONES TESTIMONY I ACTUALLY THINK SHE AND I SHARE SOME CORE VALUES. FOR EXAMPLE. I HEARD THE VALUE EXPRESSED OF INCLUSIVENESS I AGREE. IT'S PRETTY DIVERSE GROUP THAT EXISTS WITHIN- WORKGROUP WE'VE ESTABLISHED AND IT INCLUDES THE ASSOCIATION. AND I THINK FORMAL RECOGNITION OF THE ASSOCIATION'S ACTUAL ATTORNEY. AS ONE OF THEIR SPOKESPERSONS AND THE WORKER SO INCLUSIVENESS I'M FOR. I THINK ANOTHER SHARED VALUES TRANSPARENCY. I AGREE WITH MISS ROB WIND THAT THE WORKING GROUP FUNCTIONS BEST. IF PARTIES ARE BRINGING BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE OPENLY. AND DISCUSSING IT TRANSPARENTLY THAT COMMITMENT TO TRANSPARENCY IS A REASON WHY I WANTED TO DAYLIGHT THIS MORNING THAT WE HAD A PLAN IN THE YEAR YESTERDAY. AND I THINK A THIRD SHARED VALUES IS ACTUALLY BALLOTS. SO LET ME CORRECT ANY MISIMPRESSION. SO THERE WAS A WORKING GROUP MEETING IN NOVEMBER. AND AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME THE WORKING GROUP REACHED CONSENSUS I BELIEVE. THAT THE RISK THEY SAW FOR WILL ENTANGLEMENTS DIDN'T NECESSARILY WARRANTED DELAY IN THE OPEN. BUT THE WORKING GROUP WELL KNEW THEY WERE HAVING A SECOND MEETING. AND IN BETWEEN THE FIRST MEETING IN THE SECOND MEETING NO- AND OTHER SCIENTIFIC ENTITIES HAD GATHERED ADDITIONAL TRANSECT DATA. AT THE SECOND MEETING. THE WORKING GROUP BROKE INTO A MAJORITY OPINION AND A MINORITY UP AND- THE MAJORITY OPINION ADVOCATED THAT THE DEPARTMENT STICK WITH THE NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH OPENER. THE MINORITY OPINION WHICH INCLUDED SOME COMMERCIAL CRABBERS AS WELL AS ARGUABLY THE VOICE OF OUR SCIENTIFIC FEDERAL AGENCY STAFF. ADVOCATED THAT WE DELAYED UNTIL DECEMBER FIRST. BALANCE TO ME IS THE DEPARTMENT'S OUTCOME WE DELAYED SEVEN DAYS UNTIL THIS COMING WEEKEND. THAT BALANCE WAS STRUCK BETWEEN MANAGING TO AVOID WAYLAND HANG ON THE BASED ON OBJECTIVE SCIENCE. WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF HAVING THIS PRODUCT ON THE THANKSGIVING PLAY. AND THE LAST THING I'D SAY IS WE REMAIN OPEN TO ANY INSTRUCTION OR ENCOURAGEMENT FROM THE JOINT COMMITTEE PARTICULARLY THE CHAIR. CAN YOU JUST OUTLINED AS YOU MOVE FORWARD ON THE PERMIT AND- AND SEEKING FEEDBACK AND HOW THAT LOOKS. MY IMPRESSION AND MISTER MASTER CAN CORRECT ME IF I HAVE IT WRONG IS WE NEED TO USE THE WORKING GROUP AS A ENTITY THAT ADVISES US ON THE PARAMETERS. AND THE COMPONENTS OF WHAT MIGHT BE IN THE FINAL APPLICATIONS FOR A FEDERAL PERMIT. WE NEED TO DO THAT IN PARALLEL WITH USING THAT ADVICE TO POPULATE THE STATE WILL MAKING WE WILL PURSUE IN FRONT OF OUR FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. WE CAN'T DO WITHOUT THAT BODY GIVING US THE ADVICE ON CONTENT AND APPROACH. SMASHED OF ANYONE AND THEN TURN IT BACK OVER TO MISS YET ONE INSTRUCTION. THANK YOU. I WOULD JUST ADD. A KEY DOCUMENT AND THAT OUTRAGE IS THE ACTUAL RULE MAKING THAT IS THE POWER. BEHIND THE CONSERVATION PLAN I. T. P. WE SHARE THAT IN SEPTEMBER HAVE GOTTEN INPUT. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE WE WILL BE DOING OUT REACH ON THE FULL CONSERVATION PLAN BUT MOST THE CONSERVATION PLAN IS CONTEXT. THE CORE ELEMENT THAT WILL ACT ON THIS FISHERY IS THE RULES AND SOUL ANYONE INTERESTED FOCUS ON THOSE THAT'S WHERE WE NEED THE INPUT BECAUSE IT IT IS IT REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE FEDERAL AGENCIES. A WHAT THEY FEEL THEY WILL BE FIND ACCEPTABLE. AND AS MENTIONED EARLIER WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE RULES. PROVIDE THE KIND OF CLARITY AND TRANSPARENCY AND HOW THAT FISHERIES GOING TO BE REGULATED UNDER THIS ENVIRONMENTAL FOCUS ON THE RULES THAT'S THE KEY ACTION ITEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH S. THREE SERVICE ROUTE ONE AND A START WHEN SHOPPING AND THIS TIME IT WILL GO TO HIS RIGHT MIND- MR UP NINE. ANY RESPONSE TO THAT IN REGARDS TO. BOTH IT WILL WORKING GROUP UTILIZING THAT AS WELL AS- FORMALIZING FEEDBACK AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE STATE PERMIT PROCESS PLEASE MR OPPENHEIM THEY'LL TURN FROM IS WRONG. WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK HERE. THROUGH THE WORKING GROUP IT IS A KEY. AVENUE BY WHICH GROUND TREE THING THE REGULATORY DISCUSSION. IS ACCOMPLISHED. I WANT TO COOK JUST DIVE A LITTLE DEEPER INTO THE ISSUE I MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT. IT COMMUNICATION WITH THE FEDERAL AGENCY. THE FEDS HAVE. A KEY QUESTION ON RESULTS HERE. WITHOUT THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION THE STATE CAN'T PROCEED. THE QUESTION IS HOW DO WE RECONCILE POTENTIALLY- DIFFERING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MARINE MAMMAL PROTECTION ACT AND THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT WHICH BOTH EVALUATE IMPACTS AND STOCKS OF MARINE IMPACTS TO MARINE MAMMALS AND STOCKS OF MARINE MAMMALS. IN DIVERGENT WAYS. IN SOME WAYS THE MARINE MAMMAL PROTECTION ACT TIED IT PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY IN OTHER WAYS IT DOES NOT AND THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IN THE WAY THAT IT. EVALUATES AND CONTEMPLATES IMPACTS TO THE POPULATION AS A WHOLE AND- JEOPARDY OR NO JEOPARDY TO THAT POPULATION IT IS DIFFERENT. RECONCILING THOSE ISSUES IS KEY AND I'VE SPOKEN WITH THEM STAFF ABOUT THIS. LEADERSHIP THERE AS WELL I KNOW THEY KNOW THIS IS A TOP PRIORITY BUT UNTIL THEY CAN PROVIDE GUIDANCE THE STATE. WE CAN MOVE FORWARD SO I'M USING THIS PLATFORM IS AN OPPORTUNITY SHOULD SOMEONE OUT THERE IN THE UNIVERSITY LISTENING THAT WE NEED THIS NOW AND CERTAINLY THE STATE PROCESS SEES TO ENCOURAGE OUR OUR FEDERAL COLLEAGUES. TO GET THIS DONE QUICKLY IS WELCOME. APPRECIATED THANK YOU SO MUCH INSTRUMENT TURN OVER MISS RILEY FORESHORES. THANK YOU. I OF FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ORGANIZATION THINK WERE LOOKING TO FORMALIZE THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT. THAT'S BEING SAID WE HAVE PROVIDED FEEDBACK TO THE REGULATORY PROCESS THAT SAKE- IS ALLUDING TO AND I THINK THAT OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED ANYTHING BACK WE HAVEN'T HAD THAT FORM AVAILABLE TO HAVE THAT ROBUST DISCUSSION. NO THANK YOU SO MUCH- IN A GO TO CLOSING FOR ME TO YOU MISTER DIRECTOR YOU WEAR A DRESS. THE DOCUMENT WAS SUBMITTED I'M THROWIN ASSOCIATION AND I ASSUME THERE WILL BE SOME- CONVERSATION HERE IN THE COMING WEEKS ON THAT OF TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO YOU. I A COMMITTED TO GOING IN READING. OF THE SUBMISSION FROM THE ASSOCIATION WHICH I HAVEN'T DONE YET. AND THAT WE WILL HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED MOMENT- HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH THE ASSOCIATION AND THE WORK GROUP. AND MY ONLY OTHER CLOSING REMARK IS. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO AT THE DEPARTMENT. NAVIGATE THROUGH THE COMING MOMENTS TOGETHER. OUR COUNTERPART AGENCIES AND ALL THE VOICES THAT PARTICIPATE ON THIS ISSUE AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH SEMESTER YEAH I JUST TO CLARIFY- YESTERDAY I IN ONE OF OUR ATTORNEYS HAD AN HOUR AND A HALF CALL WITH CC CA TOURNEY'S. DISCUSSING LINE FOR LINE THEIR PROPOSAL SO THERE HAS BEEN SOME OUT REGION FEEDBACK NAM WERE BUSY BUT WE WILL DO BETTER AND CONTINUE TO DO THAT. NO THANK YOU SO MUCH SPECIAL COMMITTEE CLOSING COMMENTS PLEASE. I WANTED TO THANK AGAIN THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE DEPARTMENT REMAINS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH OUR PARTNERS AND STATE AGENCIES AND ALSO THE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATIONS AND THE PUBLIC TO EXPEDITED TESTING ABOVE A DUNGEON SCRAPS AND- MARK ACID. INTO MANAGEMENT THROWING CLOSING COMMENTS PLEASE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ORGANIZATION TO SPEAK TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO FORMALIZING OUR- RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PARCHMENT AND OUR CONTINUED WORK TOGETHER. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND CONSTRUCTION I'M CLOSING COMMENTS PLEASE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SENATOR MCGUIRE I WANT TO THANK OUR FLEET FOR THEIR PATIENCE FOR IT HONESTLY THERE THEIR DEDICATION AND FOR THEIR- STICK TO IT IF MISS. THESE OF AN INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING TIMES. AND A FISHERMAN REMARKED TO ME THIS MORNING. THAT IT'S BECOME SAD THIS USED TO BE FUN THIS USED TO BE A TIME WHEN YOU WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO. BOTH FEEDING YOUR FAMILY FEEDING YOUR COMMUNITY AND WE'LL BE HONEST BLESSING OF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT BECAUSE OF CHALLENGING SALMON SEASONS OR A LONG TIME BETWEEN THE LAST CRAP HALL BACK SO. IT'S TIME TO MAKE THIS SYSTEM WORK IT'S TIME TO MAKE THIS FISHERY OPERABLE AGAIN SO THAT WE DON'T START OUT YET ANOTHER SECTOR OF THE COSTA ECONOMY FROM THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A LIVING IN THIS HISTORIC INDUSTRY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND THANK YOU ALSO I'LL JUST ADD TO THE SUPPORT FROM THESE TWO AGENCIES THE REPRESENTATIVES AND THEIR STAFF WHO HAVE BEEN. CERTAINLY GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND THIS WEEKEND AT THE END OF LAST WEEK TO ENSURE THAT THIS TESTING PROCESS MOVES FORWARD- AS IT SHOULD AND I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN OUR ABILITY TO GET ON THE WATER THIS WEEK. THANK YOU SO MUCH MR BUT I MEAN ALL THE STATUS BEFORE WE ADJOURN THIS PANELS AT A FALL REALLY HAS BECOME A CHALLENGING TIME WHICH IS A FAVORITE STEVENS SEASON FOR MANY IT'S FINDING A TIME WHERE CRABBERS HE GET OUT OF THE WATER- AND MAKE IT THEIR HONEST LIVING. THERE AMONG SOME OF THE HARDEST WORKING IN THE STATE I AM AND IT IS MAN ONE CHALLENGE AFTER ANOTHER AND THE NEW TOP IT OFF WITH FIRES IN THE FALL RIGHT UP FALL HAS NOW BECOME A SEASON F. CHALLENGE FOR SO MANY IN THE STATE. I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS WHEN IT COMES OF THE CRAB FISHERY. WE MUST COEXIST. A IN THE HEALTH OF THE OCEAN MEANS A HEALTHY CRAB FISHERY AND I'LL BE THE FIRST TO SAY THAT THE THOUSANDS WHO DEPEND ON HEALTHY CRAP FISHER THE FIRST ON THE FRONT LINES THEY SAID THEY WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR WALES FOR OTHER MARINE SPECIES I AND OF COURSE FOR THEIR FAMILIES A AND I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THE WORLD THAT FLEET- BUT WE HOPE WOULD BE ON NOVEMBER SIXTEENTH THOUSAND MENDOCINO. FROM CAROLINE WILL BE OUT IN THE WATERS MAKE IN THEIR HARD EARNED LIVING IN PROTECTION- THOSE SPECIES OF WHALES THAT ARE OUT WITH HIM- AND I KNOW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE AYE DILIGENT IN THOSE EFFORTS AS WELL AS WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE FISHERMEN I WANT TO SAY NEVER THANK YOU TO EACH OF THE DEPARTMENT WHO REALLY IT WE HAVE GONE FROM. BEING REACTIVE. FIVE YEARS GOING TO BE OUR MEMBER THAT.

THANK YOU SO MUCH TO CALTRANS IN IN PARTICULAR AT THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION WHO BY THE WAY- IT HAS RECENTLY BEEN APPOINTED WE WANT TO SAY CONGRATULATIONS AND THAT'S MISTER JIM DAVIS I MISTER DAVIS- HAS BEEN WITH CALTRANS FOR QUITE A QUITE A FEW YEARS NOW AND HE'S VERY FOCUSED ON DELIVERING- BRIDGES AND HIGHWAYS ON TIME AND NOW HE'S GOING TO BE DEALING WITH FISH AND- WE HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN SEVERAL MEETINGS- OVER THE PAST MANY MONTHS AND I JUST WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO THE DOLLARS MISTER DAVIS IS THIS IS NOW PART OF SPUR FULLY THAT HE'S WORKING ON IN A TRULY MISTER DAVIS. MIGHT TAKE MOM SAY THANK YOU YOU'RE SUCH A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH WE'RE NOT GONNA BE MOVING FORWARD ON- ARE PUTTING FISH PASSAGE IN THE FAST LANE PANEL FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH THE PROMISE OF FISH FROM THE HIGHWAYS IN HEARING FROM FISH ASK EXPERTS FROM ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE'RE GONNA HAVE A DOCTOR ROBERT WAS STARTING TO PLEASE COME FORWARD HE'S AN AMAZING WORK AT UC DAVIS HE'S A RESEARCHER A COLLEGES AND- HE IS WITH THE CAL TROUT AS WELL. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK SIR HE'S- WHILE THE COLD WATER FISH SCIENTISTS FROM THE CENTER. OF WATERSHED SCIENCES- AT- AT DAVIS AND WE ARE SO GRATEFUL THAT YOU WERE HERE TODAY SIR. WE'RE ALSO GONNA BE A WELCOME THE MARK LANCASTER THE BILL TO PLEASE JOIN US HE'S THE- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE FIVE COUNTY SALMON CONSERVATION PROGRAM. AND MARK IN HIS TEAM. HAS DONE INCREDIBLE WORK. FINE I FISH PASSAGE PROJECTS AND PARTICULARLY IN THE NORTH STATE. I HE'S GONNA BE SHOWN AS- FROM THAT AS WELL HERE TODAY AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SIR. IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU. AND THEN OF COURSE AT NO OPPENHEIM FROM THE EXACT. HE'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PACIFIC COAST. FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS I MEAN HE'S GONNA BE TALKING TO US ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE. OF GETTING THESE BARRIERS- CAM- DOWN BECAUSE IT IMPACTS THE TOTAL FISH POPULATION. ACROSS CALIFORNIA. DOCTOR THE START IT'S GOING TO KICK US OFF HE'S GOING TO PRESENT. AN OVERVIEW OF THE STATUS AMMONOIDS- THE STATUS. OF CALIFORNIA'S SALMON. HIGHLIGHTING THE URGENT NEED TO BE ADDED BOTH PROTECT AND RESTORE. CALIFORNIA'S NATIVE FISHERIES. IN THE ERA OF CLIMATE CHANGE. HE'S ALSO GOING TO ADDRESS. THE PROBLEM OF. FISH PASSAGE BARRIERS IN TRULY THAT ONE PUT. WORDS INTO THE GOOD DOCTORS AND MATH BUT- THERE IS AN URGENT NEED. A AN URGENT NEED FOR FISH TO ACCESS. HAD WATER HABITATS NEEDS CAN BE FOCUSING ON THAT IS WELL. WE'RE GOING TO GIVEN THE DOCTOR A LITTLE MORE TIME- SO HE HAS A SEVEN TO TEN MINUTES WE'RE INTERNET FOR OVER TO YOU SIR. TO BE ABLE TO KICK US OFF AND GIVE US THAT THIRTY THOUSAND FOOT VIEW. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK THE FLOOR IS YOURS DOCTOR THIS ART. THANK YOU SENATE MCGUIRE FIRST I KIND OF WANTED IT TO BASICALLY PROVIDE SOME BACK AND THE CURRENT STATUS SOMEONE IT'S IN CALIFORNIA- AND THEN REALLY DISCUSS A MECHANISM TO DECLINE BUT- THERE ARE SEVERAL BUT THE ONES THAT THE ONE PRIMARILY ON FOCUS ON TODAY OUR OUR FISH BARRIERS- ONE OF THE PRIMARY QUESTIONS WE ASKED IN THE STILL SUPPORT SOMEONE IS REPORT WAS WHAT IS THE STATUS O ALL CALIFORNIA SOME ON ITS- IN GENERAL SEVEN INTRON CALIFORNIA OR CONTINUE TO BE IN THE JOURNAL STATED KLEIN. WE PREDICT THAT 45% AND 74% OF ALL SALMON TROUT IN CALIFORNIA ARE LIKELY TO BE EXTINCT WITHIN FIFTY TO A HUNDRED YEARS. RESPECTIVELY IF PRESENT TRENDS CONTINUE. ANADROMOUS OCEAN MIGRATING FISH SUCH AS SNOW CAN STILL HIRING GENERAL GREATER RISK OF EXTINCTION IN RESIDENT OR INLAND SPECIES. IN THE REPORT AND I SHOULD ALSO MENTION THAT- DOCTOR PETER MOYLES LEAD AUTHOR THIS REPORT- I WORKED ON THIS REPORT AS WELL WITH JACOB CATS- AND PAT SAMUEL CAL TROUT AS WELL. WE THEN ASKED WHAT FACTORS OF BECAUSE OUR DECLINE THERE SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO- SOMEONE A DECLINE IN THE STATE ONE OF THE MAJOR SINGULAR THREATS THAT WE FOUND AND SEE TO SOME ON ITS WITH THIS PASSAGE. HERE'S A MIGRATION FOR JUVENILES AND ADULTS- MONADS ARE LEADING CAUSE OF POPULATION DECLINE FOR SOMEONE IT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ANOTHER IMPORTANT- IN MAJOR THREAT CONTINUES TO BE CLIMATE CHANGE. BOTH BARRIERS AND CLIMATE CHANGE ARE INHERENTLY LINKED. ACCESS THE COLD AND CLEAN WATER WILL BE PARAMOUNT AT THE SPECIES ARE TO PERSIST INTO THE FUTURE. IN PART THE KETER STORING SALMON AND TROUT THROUGHOUT CALFORNIA'S RESTORING ACCESS TO DIVERSE IN PRODUCTIVE HABITATS THAT ALREADY EXIST INDEED THIS IS ONE OF THE MAIN CONCLUSIONS IN THE STATE OF SOME ON ITS REPORT THE EASIEST WAY TO DO THIS IS NOT TO SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AN ILL ADVISED CHANNEL RESTORATION PROJECTS OR PRODUCTION HATCHERIES TO PRODUCE MORE FISHING HABITATS WHERE THEY CAN'T EXIST OR SURVIVE. IT SIMPLY TO PROVIDE FISH PASSAGE HISTORICAL HABITAT HABITAT THAT ALREADY EXISTED IN MANY CASES IS IN PRISTINE CONDITION. THE REASON TO DO THIS ARE TWO FOLD FIRST SALMON POPULATIONS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE GENERAL BECOME GENETICALLY HOMOGENIZE ELECT DIVERSITY MAKING AN EXTREMELY VULNERABLE TO SUDDEN CHANGES IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT. ACCESS HISTORICALLY PRODUCTIVE IN DIVERSE HABITATS WILL IMPROVE POPULATION DIVERSITY AND SPECIES RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. SECONDLY REMOVAL BEARERS WILL PROVIDE ACCESS TO COLD HAD WATER HABITATS AND SPRINGS. THESE HABITATS WILL BE KEY ON A RAPIDLY CHANGING CLIMATE AND THE STREAM WATER TEMPERATURES WARM. IN THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE SPRING SNOWMELT AND FALL RAINS BECOMES A PROLONGED. TRANSCRIPT HOW TRANS CURRENTLY HAS OVER FIVE THOUSAND ROAD CROSSINGS AND SOMEONE IN STREAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND AS SUCH IS THE SINGLE LARGEST OWNER MANAGER FISH BEARS IN CALIFORNIA THIS COMEDIAN CALTRANS OF AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO RESTORE FISH PASSAGE THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO PROVIDE ACCESS IMPORTANT HERE HISTORICAL HABITATS. THAT ARE BEING KEY TO LONG TERM PERSISTENCE OVER NATIVE AND ENDEMIC SOME ON ITS- THIS CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER IT HAS TO HAPPEN NOW. RESTORING FISH PASSAGE MANY THESE BETTER SHUT SHOULD FOCUS ON FULL REMEDIATION AND NOT PARTIAL REMEDIATION TECHNIQUES. BRIDGES IN FULL SPAN TO BE HIGHLY PRIORITIZE THROUGHOUT THE STATE PARTICULARLY LOS OF THOSE LOCATIONS WERE FISH STAND TO BENEFIT THEMOST. BRIDGES AND FULL SPANS ENSURE UNIMPEDED ACCESS TO HAD WATER HABITAT. PROCESS CEASE TO FUNCTION PROPERLY PROCESSES TO DELIVER VITAL INPUT NECESSARY TO CREATE COMPLEX HABITAT FOR SALMON INCLUDING A LARGE WOULD SETTLEMENT IN AND FOOD WEBS. INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON FOR REMEDIATION IMPAIR SITES TO OFTEN MANAGERS FOCUS ON RESTORATION DYSFUNCTIONAL HABITAT IN PLACE A PASSENGER WERE PARTIAL SOLUTION SUCH AS ROAD CULVERT OR EVEN ARTS CULVERTS ARE YOU ARE CONSIDERED. THESE PROJECTS ALMOST ALWAYS INVALUABLE IN THAT INEVITABLY FAIL TO SOME EXTENT BECAUSE THEY IMPEDE NATURAL GM GEOMORPHIC AN ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES IMPLEMENTING BRIDGES SIMPLE SPENDS BERRIER SITES IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST. PATH FORWARD. I'D LIKE TO END MY CONCLUDE MY COMMENTS WITH HOW IT BEGAN THE SIMPLE FACT IS THIS WE PROJECTED THAT FORTY FIVE AND 75% OVER NATIVE SOMEONE AS ARE EXPECTED TO BE EXTIRPATED THE NEXT FIFTY TWO HUNDRED YEARS RESPECTIVELY. IF PRESENT TRENDS CONTINUE AND THE FISH BIRDS ARE MAJOR REASON FOR OBSERVE DECLINE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BUT AS THE LAST PORTENT- THE LAST PART OF THIS RESULT FROM SOS REPORT THAT IS KEY QUOTE IF PRESENT TRENDS CONTINUE TO BE CLEAR EXHORTATION EXTINCTION OF SOMEONE THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS NOT A SELF FULFILLING PROPHECY. AND THAT THIS COMMUTING CALTRANS OF ENORMOUS AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY BUT ALSO RESPONSIBILITY INFERNO THEM YOUR JOB IS EASY PROVIDE ACCESS TO STORE CALL HABITATS IN THE FISH WILL RETURN. THIS WORK HOWEVER CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER TIMES QUICKLY RUNNING OUT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH I JUST IF YOU QUESTIONS SO. TALK TO US ABOUT THE CHALLENGES SO- KNOW THAT CALTRANS HAS. BEEN WORKING ON MAKING PROGRESS THERE'S A LOT OUT THERE IN IN CANDIDLY RIGHT THIS IS HISTORICAL PROBLEM THIS IS BEEN HAPPENING ACROSS THE GENERATIONS. SO TELL ME SOME OF THE MOST COMMON CHALLENGES THAT YOU SEE TO BE ABLE TO GET UP TO THOSE- HIS STORE COLD WEATHER. AT HABITAT IF YOU DON'T MIND THE FISH THE FISH PASSAGE IS A BIG ONE RIGHT SO I LEARNED ACTUALLY FROM A DEAR FRIEND. TWENTY YEARS AGO TOM WHY SLOW ABOUT FISH PASSES SUCCESS STORIES IN THE NORTH COAST- AND I HAVE THE VIDEOS AND WE TALKED ABOUT IT EXTENSIVELY THE CHRISTMAS DAY FLOOD FROM THE SIXTIES RIGHT. LOT OF ROADS BLOOD OUT WHAT CULVERTS WHEN AND THAT PROVIDED ENORMOUS- PROBLEMS FOR SOME ON IT- FISH PASSAGE IS A HUGE DEAL THE IMPORTANT THING THAT I WANTED TO CONVEY. IS THE STATE OF THE HABITAT IN MANY CASES ABOVE THOSE BARRIERS IS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION SO RATHER THAN SPENDING MILLIONSAND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF RESTORING KIND OF DYSFUNCTIONAL HABITAT. IT REALLY HAS A VERY SORDID. HISTORY RIGHT IT IS TO IF THEY CAN SUPPORT FISH IT'S MUCH EASIER I HINK TO RESTORE. ACCESS TO HABITATS THAT ALREADY EXIST. AND THAT HELPS AT ALL YEAH IN A ARE YOU DO YOU HAVE A LENS ON MORE OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR THIS IN THE NORTH COAST IN PARTICULAR WHERE- IN IT IS WHEN I GET WHERE. YOUR EYES ARE ON THIS IS THAT. MENDOCINO HUMBLE DOWN NORTH. NOT SO MUCH SONOMA COUNTY HI CAN YOU GENERALLY TALK ABOUT THAT. BECAUSE A IS SPECIALLY ON THE NORTH COAST IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT MENDOCINO IN- IN HUMBLE IN DOWN OR- THAT A LOT OF FOLKS. PRISTINE HABITAT PLEASE GO RIGHT AHEAD YEAH THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY YOU HIT THE MAIN POINTS RIGHT THERE MOST OF MY RESEARCH IS FOCUSED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THIS IS SOMEONE TO SUPPORT OLD. COVERED SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT THERE ARE A FEW FOR YOU KNOW IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COMPARATIVELY SO. MENDOCINO HUMBOLDT THOSE. ARE HUGE AREAS WHERE THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE. THE HABITAT AGAIN IS RELATIVELY PRISTINE THERE ARE ISSUES OF COURSE WITH WATER TROLLS AND WHATNOT- ILLEGAL DIVERSIONS BUT THE KEY IS THE HABITAT IS THERE AND IS VERY GOOD CONDITION. NOT SEEN SOME OF THAT HABITAT I'VE BEEN OUT THERE ON ON TOWARDS WITH FOLKS AND CAL TROUT WITH UC DAVIS AND OTHERS SO. YEAH IN A CAN YOU ARE ALSO TALK ABOUT HOW CLIMATE CHANGE AS EXASPERATED THIS PROBLEM- AND- OBVIOUSLY WERE. SOME OF THE PREVIOUS REPORTS WE'VE HEARD IN COMMITTEES SPECIALLY. ON THE SACRAMENTO. BUT THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST THREATENED RIVERS RIGHT ESPECIALLY WITH TEMPERATURES BUT- CAN YOU JUST TALK ABOUT HOW CLIMATE CHANGE HAS EXASPERATED ISSUE. SO TO IT THERE ARE MANY FACTS RELATED TO SOME ON AS WITH CLIMATE CHANGE THE BIG ONE OF COURSE IS- GENERAL PROJECTIONS IS AN INCREASE IN WATER TEMPERATURE THAT ROAD ALREADY SEEING AND PERCENT MORE PRECIPITATION FALLING AS RAIN LOSSES NOW AND HAVING THAT PERIOD- FROM THE SPRING TO THE FALL THAT THAT BASEBALL PERIOD REALLY EXPANDING RIGHT. THAT'S AT OVER SUMMER PERIOD AND SO OPENING UP PASSAGE TO THESE PRISTINE HEADWATERS IN MANY CASES AND SPRINGS ALLOWS FISH TO OVER SUMMER IN COLD WATER- THERE'S AN ARTICLE THAT CAME OUT RECENTLY ABOUT A FISH CALLED THE SAWFISH. IN THE IN THE GREAT BARRIER REEF AND SCIENTISTS HAVE SEEN HOW IT IS BEEN ABLE TO MIGRATE TO DIFFERENT WATERS. TO ESSENTIALLY DEAL WITH THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IS REALLY INTERESTING- SOME MONADS FOR THEIR- INLAND PART OF THEIR OR THEIR RESIDENT PART OF YOUR LIFE HISTORY DON'T HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY THEY REALLY CAN'T GO ANYWHERE RIGHT THERE IN STREAMS- AND SO OPENING THAT HABITAT UP THAT HAS BEEN CLOSED OFF FOR. IN SOME CASES SIXTY TO SEVENTY YEARS WOULD BE VERY GOOD FOR THE FAST BECAUSE IT BE ABLE ACCESS THAT COLD WATER DURING SUMMER AND THAT'S WHEN THEY NEED IT. SOMEONE IS ARE THE MOST. INSENSITIVE SPECIES TO WARM WATER RIGHT FROM FOR NATIVE FISHES IN CALIFORNIA- AND SO THEY REALLY NEED THAT COLD WATER IN THE CONCERN IS. THAT THEY IN SOME CASES ALREADY SEEING THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THAT THEY HAVE NOWHERE TO GO OPENING UP FISH PASSAGE BARRIERS TO THOSE HABITATS WILL ALLOW THEM. TO REALLY DO WELL DURING SUMMER PERIOD. IN YOUR- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC NUMBER OR MORE OF THAT. KIND OF A ROUGH ESTIMATE- ARE WE LOOKING AT. AGAIN ROUGH ESTIMATE. HALF OF STREAMS FOR IT WITH THEIR I. IN THE NORTH COAST. AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE SOME TYPE THE BARRIERS BASED OFF OF. HISTORICAL HIGHWAY PROJECTS WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AS FAR AS PERCENTAGE THAT MAY BE OUT THERE. YEAH I I'M NOT SURE I COULD TELL USE IN AN EXACT PERCENTAGE TO BE HONEST ON ROADS IN CULVERTS AND KIND OF HOW MUCH HABITAT IS CUT OFF BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY SAY. HUNDREDS IF NOT A THOUSAND MILES OF FISH HABITAT- AND AGAIN. IT I WANT TO REFLECT BACK ON THE CLIMATE CHANGE QUESTION IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT- COLD WATER BUT IT'S ALSO PROVIDING THE FISH WITH WHAT THEY NEED FOR THEIR LIFE CYCLE FOR THEIR LIFE HISTORY. GETTING TO THE HABITATS WERE HISTORICALLY THEY SPAWNED IN A REAR DOES ANOTHER KEY COMPONENT OF THAT. I THINK THAT WE'RE LOOKING IT OVER A AND I KNOW CALTRANS WILL GO INTO THIS BUT I THINK I TOTAL INVENTORY OF APPROXIMATELY SIX THOUSAND ACROSS THE STATE. FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PROJECTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED OVER THE LAST MANY YEARS- BUT REALLY. THERE'S SOME KEY PROJECTS THAT COULD BE ADVANCED AT THAT WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT OF THE SPECIES- WITH A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. DR ANY OTHER ITEMS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO BE A TO MENTION BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO SOMETHING I'VE JUST SAID I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT KIND OF THE PRIORITIZATION AND THE IN THE BROADER TIMELINES ON THIS AND HOW IT'S BEEN GOING- I KNOW THAT. I APPRECIATE CALTRANS WORK- AND I KNOW THEY ARE VERY BUSY KEEPING THE ROADS INTACT RIGHT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND SO THEY HAVE OTHER THINGS BUT- THE BIG THING HERE IS. IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS IT HAS TO HAPPEN SOON BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TIME LEFT RIGHT AND SO IF FOR SITTING AROUND. AND NOT GETTING IT DONE THAT COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE FOR SO ON ITS IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND HAVE A HANG WITH US RIGHT THERE OR YOU SHEET THAT WE'RE NOW GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO. A MARK LANCASTER HE'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE FIVE COUNTY SEMINAL AID. CONSERVATION PROGRAM. IN WHAT MARK IS THAT IS PRETTY COOL- HE'S WORKED WITH FIVE RURAL- ECONOMICALLY CHALLENGED COUNTIES. TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT REALLY A- BIOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT. PROJECTS BASED OFF OF- FISH PASSAGE. AND TAKING DOWN HISTORICAL IMPEDIMENTS. BY ANY IS BEEN ABLE TO DO WHAT. AT A BARGAIN BASEMENT PRICE IF YOU WILL- WHICH IS PRETTY- JUST. REALLY IMPRESSIVE MARK ALSO- WORKED ON IN THE REGIONAL SB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN TWO THOUSAND FIVE. RELATED TO FISH PASSAGE IN CALTRANS. AND I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO MISTER LANCASTER SIR YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO BE A TALK ABOUT. CHALLENGES YOU SEE HOW YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU HAVE. IN SOME POTENTIAL OPTIONS. AT THAT COULD BE DEPLOYED- WITHIN THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. FOR SHORE SIR IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU THANKS VERY WORK. A GOOD MORNING THANK YOU MY POWER POINT IS A WHIRLWIND IT'S BASICALLY A CELEBRATION OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE SINCE SB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN PASSED. YOU SHOULD JUST BE ABLE TO HIT. START FROM FOR FROM BEGINNING. AND IT'S ALSO TRYING TO BE FIVE MINUTES AND THIRTY SECONDS LONG SO GOOD MAN. SO GO BACK TO THE POWER POINT ITSELF INTO UP ABOVE IT SHOULD SAY START. LYTRO. WE CAN EITHER WING IT OR WE CAN MAKE IT WORK ONE OR THE OTHER. SO BASICALLY IF I CAN ON THE FIVE COUNTIES. REPRESENTS THE NORTHWEST CALIFORNIA COUNTIES IN WHICH HAVE APPROXIMATELY FOUR THOUSAND MILES OF ROADS. THE FIGHT CAN IS PROGRAM STARTED IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WITH A LISTING OF THE CO WHO IS A FEDERAL AND ENDANGERED SPECIES ARE THREATENED SPECIES. AND THE ISSUE FOR THE COUNTIES WAS REALLY SIMPLE THE NORTHERN SPOTTED ALLAH BECAUSE A LOT OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DISRUPTION. SO THE COUNTIES DIDN'T WANT TO FACE THE PROBLEMS A NOT ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE WITH SOMEONE AND SO THE FIRST THING THEY DID. IS THEY ASSEMBLED OUR PROGRAM THE- THE AGREED TO ELIMINATE POLITICAL BOUNDARIES FOR DECISION MAKING AROUND SALMON CONSERVATION AND THEY FOCUSED ON WATERSHED BOUNDARIES- THE PROGRAM IS PARALLEL TO CALTRANS IF YOU WILL IT'S COUNTY ROADS IT'S FOUR THOUSAND MILES OF ROADS. THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS COMPLETE THEM MIGRATION BERRIER INVENTORY WE IDENTIFIED THREE HUNDRED BARRIERS ON COUNTY ROAD SYSTEMS AS WELL AS A SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT SOURCE PROGRAM. IN THE KILLINGS BEGIN IMPLEMENTING- PROJECTS AS SOON AS THEY DID THE THREE HUNDRED BARRIERS THE- THE REALIZE IT WAS BIGGER THAN THEY CAN TACKLE SO THEY CREATED A BIOLOGICAL PRIORITIZATION PROCESS. TO FOCUS WHICH PROJECT WOULD BE DONE FIRST. ZOOMING VERY QUICKLY FORWARD TO TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE BEARS HAVE BEEN REMOVED AT TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS OR ABOUT. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MILE OF RESTORED HABITAT WHICH IS VERY CHEAP. BUT THE PROGRAM ALSO SERVES AS A PEARL TO CALTRANS AND SO ON. BY THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND. IT WAS APPARENT TO ME THAT CALTRANS WAS MOVING VERY VERY SLOWLY. IN FACT I'D SAY NOT MOVING AT ALL. AROUND MIGRATION BARRIER REMOVAL SO. BY TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE WE BASICALLY HAD HEARD A SERIES OF ARGUMENTS BY CALTRANS AS TO WHY THEY COULD NOT MOVE FORWARD IN THOSE VERY VERY BRIEFLY WERE. THE EACH PROJECT HAD TO BE INDIVIDUALLY DESIGNED THAT THE DESIGN PROCESS WAS VERY SLOW AND VERY CUMBERSOME- AND THAT- THERE JUST WASN'T ENOUGH SUFFICIENT FUNDING NINE AND AGAIN THE SLIDES ARE MORE OF A CELEBRATION OF THE PROJECT AS I GO FORWARD BUT- THAT THAT SIMPLY IS NOT. CORRECT THE FIVE COUNTIES HAVE USE OFF THE SHELF STRUCTURAL DESIGNS TO IMPLEMENT SEVENTY THREE PROJECTS. THOSE PROJECTS REPRESENT NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY YEARS OF PASSAGE SINCE- NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WHEN THE FIRST ONE IS INSTALLED TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO. THE LAST ONE STALLED LAST YEAR. THESE ARE ALL PRODUCTS A RAPIDLY AVAILABLE THROUGH MANUFACTURERS- THEY'RE ALL SPANS FROM TWENTY FOUR TO A HUNDRED FORT. THE PRIMARY DELAYS I SEE WITH CALTRANS OR- RELATED AROUND THEIR IABILITY TO PUSH PROJECTS THROUGH. AND THAT DOESN'T NEED TO BE THE CASE. THE HOUSE OF THE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE EXACT SAME ARGUMENTS THAT THEY HAD SINCE. TWO THOUSAND. THEY HAVE SUBSTANTIAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES PRESENT WE HAVE THOSE SAME COMMITTEES THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEING DISCUSSED TODAY IN THOSE COMMITTEES ARE NUANCES. OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE DISCUSSED IN THE PAST THEY'RE NOT SIGNIFICANT- NEW AREAS OF DEVELOPMENT AND I AND SO I'M SOMEWHAT CONCERNED AS TO. CONVINCING CALTRANS TO MOVE FORWARD IN A MUCH RAPID MUCH MORE RAPID PROCESS ON. 90% OF THE FIVE COUNTIES PROGRAM PROJECTS ARE FULL STREAM SIMULATION 10% OR ADAPTATIONS I BELIEVE THAT- OF THE FORTY THREE PROJECTS CALTRANS IS DONE SINCE THE- IMPLEMENTATION OF SB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN SIX HAVE BEEN FULL STREAM SIMULATION. I GUESS THE THING THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND IS TO RECOGNIZE THIS IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE. FROM THESE STRUCTURES SPAN- SMALL STREAMS TO MID SIZE STREAMS ALL OF WHICH FALL WITHIN RELATIVELY EASY ENGINEERING. DESIGNS. AND IRONICALLY. WHEN AND I'M SORRY WE PASSED THE SLIDE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE BUT- I WOULD LIKE TO USE A COUPLE OF CASE STUDIES RELATIVE TO OUR PROGRAM AND TO CALTRANS AND THAT IS- RYAN CREEK IN MENDOCINO COUNTY IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. WE REMOVE THE DOWNSTREAM MIGRATION BARRIER WHICH WITH A FULL STREAM SIMULATIONS STRUCTURE. AND THEN THE HIGHWAY ONE OH ONE LIES JUST UPSTREAM OF THAT BARRIER WHICH WAS A PARTIAL BERRIER. AN UPSTREAM OF THAT WAS A PRIVATE ROOM BERRIER WE EMOVE THAT ONE IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN. THE CALTRANS PROGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN WAS ABLE TO MODIFY THE HIGHWAY ONE A ONE STRUCTURE WITH NOT A FULL STREAM SIMULATION BUT RATHER. TO CULVERTS THAT WERE JACKSON BOARD UNDERNEATH THE HIGHWAY SO. THE THEY WERE NOT EVEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE FULL STREAM SIMULATION IN THE SAME WATERSHED UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM THE PRIVATE AND THE COUNTY WERE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT. BUT I RECOGNIZE THE COMPLEXITIES OF HIGHWAY ONE A ONE MAKES THAT MORE DIFFICULT. BUT I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE COMMITTEE. AND FOR CALTRANS TO TAKE A MORE. COLLABORATIVE APPROACH AND EXAMINE HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH SEVENTY THREE PROJECTS THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER COST FOR THE SAME SIZE PREMIUMS IF YOU WILL AS WELL CALTRANS FACES FOR MOST OF THESE AND I WOULD SAY TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. THE DECLINE THE CHANGING IN CLIMATIC VARIATION IN AND ONE OF THINGS THAT WE'RE SEEING MORE SUBSTANTIALLY. IS THE EFFECTS OF WILDFIRE AFFECTS ON THESE WATERSHEDS THE AMOUNT OF HABITAT AVAILABLE IS DECLINING EVEN AS WE RESTORE BECAUSE WE'RE LOSING SO MUCH OF THAT HABITAT. PARTICULARLY IN THE- IN THE INTERIOR IS AND THAT IS FIVE MINUTES AND THIRTY SECONDS. I WILL STOP THERE. YEAH IN IF YOU DON'T MIND TALKING ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THAT LOOK- YES A MASSES BURN SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN RIGHT MASSIVE OVER- IN THE CHICO PARADISE BUTTE COUNTY AREA. CINEMA COUNTY. YOU CAN'T KEEP UP RIGHT AGNESE BARRIERS EMPLOYED- WITH THE MASS OF THE SIZES COMPANIES FIRES TO TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT YOU JUST START TOUCHING ON. THE PROJECTED BURN RATE FOR THE KLAMATH TRINITY AT THIS POINT IS THE ENTIRE- WATER SHOULD BE BURNED WITHIN A THIRTY YEAR PERIOD AND THESE ARE NOT ON THE LOW INTENSITY FIRES THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEN IN THE PAST. THESE TEND TO BE VERY HIGH INTENSITY AND SO THE- THE ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF HABITAT THAT'S BEING LOST THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE FUTURE FOR THE SPECIES IS TO MOVE NOW. WE LITERALLY CAN'T WAIT FOR THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY PEOPLE THAT SIT ON THE VARIOUS ADVISORY COMMITTEES TO CALTRANS OR- OR THE THIRTY ENGINEER DESIGNS TO COME UP WITH STANDARDIZED DESIGNS THAT ALREADY EXIST. THE ISSUE HERE IS. THAT THE DECLINING HABITATS ARE THE PRIMARY. DRIVER OR SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY DRIVER NOW IN SB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN AND YOU'LL HEAR CALTRANS SAY THIS REPETITIVELY. THEY CAN'T DO FISH PASSAGE IN LOSS OF THE TRANSPORTATION RELATED OF FACT WELL IN FACT THE- THE STATE OF WASHINGTON MADE THE SAME ARGUMENT IN THE SUPREME COURT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SAID% NO RELATIVE TO AT LEAST INDIAN TRIBE. TREATY TREATY OBLIGATION AREAS WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THE KLAMATH TRINITY. BUT I THINK THAT THE ISSUES AROUND YES THEY ARE NOT THAT DISSIMILAR TO THE ISSUES AROUND THE TRIBAL CONCERNS. THERE NEEDS TO BE A REFOCUSING CALTRANS TO MOVIES PROJECTS FORWARD MUCH FASTER AND. I WILL JUST SAY I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN INHERENT. FOSSILS THERE THAT NEEDS TO BE MODIFIED STE SHAKEN UP IF YOU WILL BECAUSE TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. MANY OF THE SO WE YOU'RE TAKING A LOOK AT MANY OF THESE. RURAL COUNTIES RESOURCES ARE LIMITED RIGHT AND- HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS. THE VERY AND I'M GLAD YOU ASKED THAT. THESE GUYS ARE PROBABLY THE POOREST COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA AND YET THEY HAVE COMPLETED THE MOST BARRIER PROJECTS AND IN THE STATE AND POSSIBLY IN THE COUNTRY. THEY'VE DONE IT BECAUSE THEY'VE USED LITERALLY OFF THE SHELF DESIGNS FROM MANUFACTURERS FOR THE BULK OF THEM THE VIEWS THE WIDE VARIETY OF TECHNIQUES THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TECHNIQUES AND IN DESIGNS FOR THESE THINGS IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT ONCE YOU'VE DONE THE MODELING FOR THE FLOWS AND SCOUR ANALYSIS THE FOOTINGS. THEN IT'S JUST A MATTER OF FINDING FOR MANY OF THESE CROSSINGS NOT ALL FOR MANY THIS IS FINDING THE RIGHT PRODUCT TO BE ABLE TO CONVEY EITHER FULL PASSAGE WERE IN THE CASES WHERE YOU CAN'T. AND I DO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THAT WE NEED TO OPEN THE CALTRANS AND OTHERS HAVE USE THE ARGUMENT. THE FULL SPAN FULL CONVEYANCE STRUCTURES. ARE THE ONLY WAY TO GO AND SO THE DELAYS HAVE BEEN IN TRYING TO GET THAT DONE AND THAT HAS ACTUALLY CUT OFF HABITAT FOR MORE THANTWO DECADES IN MY OPINION. THAT SHOULD BE OPENED UP AT LEAST WITH A OF SMALLER STRUCTURES WERE NECESSARY WE'RE PLAYING TRIAGE. BUT THE COUNTIES OF USES OFF THE SHELF DESIGNS THEY HAVE USED TO ARM IN REPETITIVE USE OF THE SAME TYPES OF DESIGN SO THEY HAVE FOR THE CONSISTENT ANALYSIS IN THIS ASSESSMENT OF THE- EQUIPMENT NEEDED TO DO THE WORK. THE TECHNIQUES THE TIME LINES AND ALL OF THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS FRANK HAS TO RETURN IT OF FOR CLOSING COMMENTS WERE PANEL HERE AFTER WE HEAR FROM NO OPPENHEIM. AS YOU ALL OF HER DISEASE I COULD DIRECTOR OF THE PACIFIC COAST. FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATION LOOK. AT SALMON FISHERMEN. ARE IMPACTED SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE LOSS OF SALMON HABITAT. AND HE'S GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT RESOLVING FISH PASSAGE CHALLENGES N PARTICULAR. IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON IN THEIR DESIRE. TO BE ABLE TO GET PROJECTS MOVED ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM ALTERNATE OVER TO MR UP IN A. THANK YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE AND IT REMAINS GOOD TO BE WITH YOU THIS MORNING- THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS ISSUE SALMON. HAVE THRIVED IN CALIFORNIA FOR MILLENNIA. THEY USED BOTH FRESH AND SALT WATER HABITATS I THEIR DIVERSE LIFE HISTORY STRATEGIES HAVE ENABLED THEM TO SURVIVE THE EVER CHANGING AND SOMETIMES VIOLENT. NATURE OF OUR REGION OFTEN PRONE TO EARTHQUAKES DROUGHT MUD SLIDES WILDFIRES FLOODS EVEN VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS. BUT THESE FISH DON'T STAND A CHANCE AGAINST THE RAVENOUS THIRST OF CORPORATE AGRIBUSINESS THE DAMMING OF NEARLY EVERY RIVER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND AT ISSUE TODAY THE CONSTRUCTION OF IMPASSABLE ROADS OR POORLY ENGINEERED CULVERTS. THESE MICHAEL FISHER BORN IN FRESHWATER STREAMS ACROSS THE WEST AFTER VARYING AMOUNTS OF TIME IN FRESH WATER THEY MIGRATE DOWNSTREAM HUNDREDS OF MILES TO THE OCEAN WHERE THEY RANGE FOR THOUSANDS OF MILES FEEDING AND GROWING FOR SEVERAL YEARS. BEFORE FIGHTING THEIR WAY BACK UPSTREAM TO THE SAME WATERS WHERE THEY WERE BORN DESPONDENT AND- IF OUR MEMBERS ARE LUCKY ENOUGH. SOME OF THEM END UP ON THE HOOKS AND ON THE BACK DECK OF OUR FISHING BOATS- AND OF COURSE ALONG THE WAY THESE FISHER VITAL PRAY FOR COUNTLESS SPECIES. OF COURSE FOR HUMANS RECREATIONAL COMMERCIAL. FISHERS CULVERTS THE BLOCK STREAMS AND PREVENTS THEM FROM REACHING THE FRESHWATER HABITAT INTER OF THE CYCLE AT EVERY TURN. ARTS BLOCK MATURE SALMON TRAVELING UPSTREAM FROM FRESHWATER HABITAT WHERE THEY COULD SPAWN. AND THESE FISH AS THEY SEARCH FOR IDEAL REARING HABITAT N FRESHWATER STREAMS- ONCE THEY EVENTUALLY MIGRATE DOWNSTREAM TO THE OCEAN MUST BE ABLE TO HAVE PASSAGE. THE AMOUNT OF HABITAT THAT THESE BARRIERS ELIMINATE IS HUGE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HUNDREDS OF STREAM MILES AS MENTIONED EARLIER AND THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF SPAWNING IN REARING HABITAT. UNLESS HABITAT WERE THE FISH CAN REPRODUCE MEANS FOR YOUR FISH OR ALL. RESULTING IN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CUMULATIVE IMPACTS TO OUR MEMBERS AND THE COURTS HAVE RECOGNIZED THESE IMPACTS- AND THEY'VE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THE LONGER WE WAIT THE GREATER THE IMPACTS BOTH TO COMMUNITIES AND TO THE AGENCIES THAT FAILED TO TAKE REMEDIAL ACTION. FROM CALTRANS PERSPECTIVE THE LONGER THEY WAIT THE BIGGER THE HIT COULD BE. THE DISTRICT COURT IN A CASE ASSERTING THAT WASHINGTON STATE'S POOR COVER DESIGNS AND TRACK RECORD OF PASSAGE NEGLECT AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- FOUND THAT SALMON PRODUCTION A QUOTE I'M QUOTING HERE IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE AMOUNT AND QUALITY OF HABITAT AVAILABLE LOSS AND DEGRADATION OF HABITAT HAVE GREATLY REDUCED SALMON PRODUCTION. IN THAT CASE AREA. THAT CASES WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER MADE IT ALL THE WAY THE SUPREME COURT. IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON IS NOW ON THE HOOK FOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF NOT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- THAT THEY MUST ADDRESS- AND THEY'RE SCRAMBLING WE CAN GET OUT AHEAD OF THIS PROBLEM. AND IT WAS A TRIBAL TRUST ISSUE BUT THIS IS A PUBLIC TRUST STATE AND THE PUBLIC TRUST RESOURCE OF ACCESS THE SALMON STOCKS AND SENATE FISHERIES IS KEY IN CALIFORNIA THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CULVERTS TO PROVIDE PASSAGE. IS THAT VIOLATION AND PREVENTS OUR INDUSTRY FROM THRIVING INCREASING AVAILABLE SPAWNING HABITAT BY REMOVING CULVERTS THAT BLOCKS FISH ON THE OTHER HAND CAN LEAD TO RAPID INCREASES IN SEVEN POPULATIONS AS WE'VE HEARD. AND AS THE DISTRICT COURT IN WASHINGTON THE US FOUND REMOVING BARRIER CULVERTS QUOTE PROVIDES IMMEDIATE BENEFIT IN TERMS OF SALMON PRODUCTION A SALMON RAPIDLY RECOLONIZE. THE UPSTREAM AREA AND RETURN RETURNING ADULT SPAHN THEIR. CULVERTS ARE NOT THE ONLY CHALLENGES SALMON POPULATIONS FACE. BUT THE DISTRICT COURT FINDING THAT THEIR MAJOR PART OF THE PROBLEM IS KEY HERE. IN THIS AREA WHERE THEY HAVE A HUGE IMPACT NORTH COAST RIVERS IN PARTICULAR THE BENEFITS TO COASTAL COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE HAD MAJOR SHUTDOWNS IN THE PAST LOSS OF MULTIPLE SEASONS IN A ROW LOSSES OF PARTIAL AREAS INCLUDING THE KLAMATH MANAGEMENT'S OWN THAT'S GOING TO BE KEY. THE DISTRICT COURT CORRECTLY FOUND IN THAT CASE THAT REPLACING THE STATE'S BETTER CULVERTS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY BENEFITS SALMON AND WE BELIEVE THAT. PUBLIC TRUST BENEFIT WOULD SIMILARLY BE REALIZED HERE I WOULD LOVE TO SEE CALTRANS ACHIEVING THE GOAL OF ADDRESSING ALL OF ITS PRIORITY PROJECTS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AS THE GENTLEMAN TO MY RIGHT AND LEFT. HAVE POINTED OUT THERE'S NO BETTER TIME THAN RIGHT NOW TO GET THIS DONE. THANK YOU SO MUCH ROBIN I MISS HAVING HIM TALK ABOUT- STOCK RIGHT- ESPECIALLY. A IS WHAT THE DOCTOR WAS SAYING EARLIER- IN THE NEED AND HOW THAT RELATES. TO THE HEALTH OF THE INDUSTRY FOR. CALIFORNIANS CAN YOU GO THROUGH THEIR OF ABIT AND BECAUSE SEVEN INDUSTRIES BEEN SUFFERING. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A CONTRIBUTOR. BROADLY SPEAKING THE SALMON FISHING INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA IS ON ITS KNEES. WE HAVE ABOUT. 5% THE STORE NUMBERS OF PARTICIPANTS- OVER THE PAST FORTY YEARS NOW HARVESTING THIS RESOURCE THE IMPACT OF SMALL STREAMS THE BENEFICIAL IMPACTS OF HEALTHY SMALL STREAMS CAN'T BE OVERSTATED- THE PROBLEM IS WHAT WE DO NOT HAVE ROBUST MONITORING PROGRAMS IN PLACE IN ORDER TO QUANTITATIVELY EVALUATE THESE IMPACTS BUT WE KNOW THEY'RE REAL WE KNOW THAT IN MANY PARTS OF THE COAST- IT IS. ON MARK'S NON HATCHERY FISH THAT WE KNOW ARE COMING FROM. STREAMS AND RIVERS- ON THE LAW ON LONG THE NORTH COAST HUMBOLDT COUNTY DOWN OR COUNTY ETCETERA- AND WE KNOW THAT BARRIERS TO PASSAGE COMING FROM THE SMALLER KINDS OF IMPEDIMENTS CALLED CULVERTS- FED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ETCETERA ARE KEY CONTRIBUTORS THERE WE KNOW THAT RESOLVING THESE ISSUES IS GOING TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL BENEFIT AND CULTURAL BENEFIT- TO OUR MEMBERS UP ON THE NORTH COAST. DRUM AND THANK YOU SO MUCH A GREAT JOB TODAY AND- BOTH PANELS WERE NOT GOOD. PUT IT UP FOR CLOSING COMMENTS FROM EACH OF OUR PANELISTS WILL START WITH THE DOCTOR TO BE IN A PROVIDE IS CLOSING COMMENTS WITHIN GONNA GO TO MISTER LANCASTER'S DROP IN TIME. WE WILL THEN TAKE A QUICK FIVE MINUTE BREAK- AND BRING A CALTRANS UP TO BE A YOU ARE CLOSING PANEL WE'RE GONNA TURN OVER REDUCTION THE STARTED FROM UC DAVIS YES THANK YOU- I WILL KEEP IT A QUICK I WANTED TO JUST COMMENT ON SOMETHING THAT- KNOWN MENTIONED- DID THAT I OFTEN ACTUALLY REFLECT ON AS WELL AND THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT. SALMON SOMEONE IS IN GENERAL HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR FIFTY MILLION YEARS THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH EVERYTHING THEY HAVE BEEN THROUGH VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH EARTH CREEK QUAKES DISCONNECTIONS FROM HABITAT GLACIERS I MEAN YOU NAME IT. AND THEY'VE ALWAYS PERSISTED. IN THE WORLD THE REASON WHY THEY COULD DO THAT IS BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS HAVE THE. AB ATTACHED TO SUPPORT THEM RIGHT AND ONE OF THE MAIN ISSUES RIGHT NOW NOT JUST CALTRANS IS ITS LARGE BARRIERS AS WELL- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THEY CANNOT ACCESS THE REALLY GOOD HABITAT THEY CANNOT COMPLETE THEIR LIFE CYCLE THEY DON'T HAVE THAT COLD WATER DURING OVER SUFFERING- AND SO HE TALKED ON THAT AND I JUST KIND OF WANTED TO REITERATE I THINK FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE. WE KNOW AND THE THESE ANIMALS ARE INCREDIBLY GOOD COLONIZERS POPULATIONS OF BLANKED OUT POPULATIONS COME BACK THEY CAN'T DO THAT IF. THEY ARE GENETICALLY MARGINALIZED AND IF THEY THEIR HABITAT IS A MARGINALIZED RIGHT WHICH IS WHAT WE SEE PARTICULARLY IN THE VALLEY RIGHT NOW- AND SO KEEPING THAT IN MIND I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT SHOWS YOU AGAIN IT'S NOT TO SELL FOR FILLING PROP SEE IF THE HABIT. HABITAT IS THERE TO SUPPORT THEM. THEY CAN MAKE A COMEBACK. THROUGH THE- FAST AND WHAT YOU JUST SAID IN REGARDS TO FIFTY MILLION YEARS AND- THROUGH THICK AND THIN AND AS MUCH WAS THROWN ADAM- ALWAYS GETTING BACK WITH THE OC COUNT ON. WHOSE HEADWATERS RIGHT WHERE THOSE HISTORICAL WIRES WERE AND I'M REALLY APPRECIATE YOU SAYING THAT I'M GLAD YOU ADDED THAT IN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY. TERMS LANCASTER. CLOSING COMMENTS PLEASE. A YES IN CLOSING WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS TO OFFER UP MY STAFF OF THREE TO WORK WITH CALTRANS BECAUSE WE'RE ALL GOING TO WIN IF WE CAN MOVE THINGS MUCH FASTER IN THAT THE- SOME OF THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT. IF YOU WILL OF THE COUNTIES IN THE PARTNERS IN THE FIVE C. MIGHT NOT HURT TO A- TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH CALTRANS IN MOVING THEIR PROJECTS FORWARD BECAUSE- WE BOTH NEED TO KEEP. THE COSTS DOWN BUT CERTAINLY THE- THE CALTRANS BUDGET. HOUSE THE ABILITY TO FIND ROOM FOR. INCREASED IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PROJECTS AND THAT THESE PROJECTS ARE DOING WAY MORE THAN DROST. RESTORING SOMEONE IT'S THERE AS WE SEE THESE WATERSHED BEING DEVASTATED BY FLOODS BY FIRES. THEY'RE ACTUALLY IMPROVING STORM WATER THEY'RE IMPROVING CAPACITY SAFETY. WE'VE SEEN A- IN OUR PROJECT AND NUMBER WILDLIFE SPECIES THAT NOW UTILIZED THE CROSSING SO IT'S A IT'S A MUCH MORE COLLABORATIVE MUCH MORE. BENEFICIAL THAN JOSH THE CELL MONADS BUT- TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN HELP PUSH THIS FURTHER FASTER. SO WE DON'T NEED AMENDMENTS THIS BE A FIFTY SEVEN WE STAND READY TO HELP. THANKS SO MUCH I THANK YASSER GRATEFUL AND APPRECIATE. YOU SHOWN US WHAT CAN BE DONE THANK YOU SO. MUCH FOR IN TURN OVER NOAH OPPENHEIM FOR CLOSING COMES PLEASE. GEOLOGIC TIME WAS MENTIONED IN AUSTIN. IT CAN FEEL LIKE THE BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS OPERATES AT A GLACIAL PACE. LET'S REVERSE THAT WHAT'S ENSURE THAT. THE NEXT FIFTY MILLION YEARS FRANKLY FEATURE SALMON IN CALIFORNIA AND THE DECISIONS WE MAKE IN THE NEXT FIFTY OR PERHAPS EVEN THE NEXT FIVE COULD DETERMINE THE OUTCOME. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER OPPENHEIMER WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR THESE THREE GENTLEMEN WHO HAVE JOINED US TODAY TO BE ABLE TO GIVE US A PERSPECTIVE- IN HOW TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. TIME IS SPENT UP IN REGARDS TO NEEDING BEER TO GET THESE FISH BARRIERS COMPLETED. IN DEVOID RIGHT- AND WE ARE SO APPRECIATIVE OF THE THREE OF YOU FOR YOUR INCREDIBLE WORK TO BE A PROTECT THAT SPECIES JOIN SURE THAT THEY THRIVE IN THE DECADES AND IF NOT CENTURIES TO COME. WE ARE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK RECESS WE ARE THEN GOING TO BE BRINGING UP THE TEAM FROM CALTRANS- AND WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM JIM DAVIS HE'S A CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CALTRANS WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM MICHAEL KEEPER. HE'S THE CHIEF PROJECT CHIEF IN THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT DIVISION FOR CALTRANS THERE WERE ALSO CAN HEAR FROM ANNE BAILEY SHE IS THE OFFICE CHIEF- WITHIN THE STRATEGIC THIS IS THE WORLD'S LONGEST TITLE SO HERE WE GO. THE STRATEGIC BIOLOGICAL PLAY NEED ADVANCED EDUCATION AND INFORMATION DIVISION I CALTRANS HIDING IT WATCH OUT ALL RIGHT SO- WE'RE GONNA BE BRING IN THOSE THREE UP AND WE'RE GOING O ASK. REGION. WE'LL BE BACK WITH YOU IN FIVE MINUTES THANK YOU HERE WERE NOT TO BE TURNED OVER TO OUR FINAL PANEL OF THE DAY WE'RE GONNA BE STARTING WITH THAT MISTER JIM DAVIS IS THE CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HE'S CAN ME- MISTER DAVIS- IN AGAIN AS I SAID EARLIER. HAS BEEN ENGAGE ON THIS ISSUE AND TRULY GRATEFUL FOR MISTER DAVIS GOOD TO SEE YOU AND AS I ALWAYS SAY WE MISS YOU IN DISTRICT FOUR SO- DID AN AMAZING JOB HE'S GONNA BE PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF THEIR- FISH PASSAGE PROGRAM THEY BEING CALTRANS IT'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS IS WELLS CURRENT STATUS ON FISH PASSAGE EFFORTS- HE'S GONNA ALSO DISCUSS FUNDING IN- ALSO CURRENT CHALLENGES A CALTRANS HAS IS WELL LOOK I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS- WE KNOW THERE'S APPROXIMATELY SIX. THOUSAND. POTENTIAL BARRIERS WITHIN THE ENTIRE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM A FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY KNOWN- THEIR LOCATIONS OVER THE YEARS HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE STATE- BEING THE OWNER OF- THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. IS ALSO THE LARGEST OWNER- OF FISH PASSAGE BARRIERS- IN THE GOLDEN STATE WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY SO WE'RE NOW GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MISTER DAVIS MISTER DAVIS WILL HAPPEN. SEVEN TEN MINUTES BEARD GIVES THE OVERVIEW WITHIN GONNA BE TURNING IT OVER TO MR KEEPER THEN OF COURSE MISS BAILEY FORESHORES MISTER DEPUTY DIRECTOR IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE SIR. GOOD MORNING SAM ACQUIRED JIM DAVIS- SHIFT EVERY DIRECTOR OF CALTRANS AND GLAD TO BE HERE WITH YOU TODAY. EFFECTIVE IN TWO THOUSAND SIX A SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN REQUIRES IN A PROJECT USING STATE OR FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION FUNDS. CONDUCTOR FISH PASSES HAS BEEN BEFORE PROJECT DESIGN IF THE PROJECT AFFECTS A STREAM CROSSING ON THE STREAM OR ANNA DRAMAS FISH OR HISTORICALLY WERE FOUND. CALTRANS IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT AN ASSESSMENT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND ADDED TO THE CALIPHATE SHOULD DATABASE. IF ANY STRUCTURAL BARRIERS. PASSAGE EXISTS REMEDIATION THE PROBLEM IS REQUIRED TO BE DESIGNED INTO THE PROJECT BY THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY. ROGERS MUST BE CONSTRUCTED SO THAT THEY DO NOT PRESENT A BEAR TO FISH PASSAGE WHEN BEARS TO FISH PASSAGE ARE BEING ADDRESSED PLANS AND PROJECTS A RECORD TO BE DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. SO STATUS TODAY OF THE SALMON STEELHEAD BEARS ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. TO DATE. WE HAVE PROVIDED ACCESS LIKE DR ROBERT THE SORRY WAS TALKING ABOUT TWO SEVEN HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE MILES A STILL HELD IN SALMON HABITAT FROM REMOVAL OF SEVENTY FORTY SEVEN BEARS SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX- REPEAT THAT SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILES. EXACTLY. WATER DOCTOR LIST SORRY TALKED ABOUT WAS OPENING UP OPPORTUNITIES. WE HAVE TWENTY SEVEN CURRENT PROJECTS. IN OUR INVENTORY THAT OUR PLAN TO OPEN UP A HUNDRED SIXTY SIX MILES NOW THE COST OF THESE TWENTY SEVEN BEARS IS ESTIMATED AT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. A AND I AM LOOKING FOR EFFICIENCIES AS PART OF SB ONE WOULD LIKE TO SIT DOWN- WITH MISTER LANCASTER TO SEE THERE'S OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE CAN SEE HOW THAT THEY DID THIS FOR A MUCH MORE. EFFICIENT WAY THAN WHAT WE'RE DOING TO DATE SENATOR AND YET I'LL GIVE YOU A NEW NUMBER THERE ARE CURRENTLY BASED ON NEW INFORMATION WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY EIGHT KNOWN CURRENT BARRIERS ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. ALL OF THESE SIXTY EIGHT OF THE FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT HAVE BEEN DETERMINED THROUGH THE SIX FAT FISH PASSAGE ADVISER COMMITTEES. CALTRANS ESTABLISHED ENGAGE OUR PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS. THESE COMMITTEES ME QUARTERLY DETERMINE THIS IS SUITABLE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF HABITAT. THESE COMMITTEES A TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STRIDES TO IMPROVE SCIENCE AND DATA ASSESSING PRIORITIZING AND REMEDIATING BEARS TO COORDINATION AND PLANNING. NOW IT IS SIXTY EIGHT BEARS NOW RATHER THAN SEVENTY BEARS TWO OCCASIONS A WRIST RECENTLY DROPPED FROM THE PRIORITY LIST AS NEW SCIENCE INSIGHT DATA BECAME AVAILABLE. INDETERMINATE THEY WERE NOT GOOD HABITAT OR THERE WERE OTHER NATURAL BARRIERS. THERE ARE CURRENTLY EIGHT THOUSAND TWENTY EIGHT ROAD IN STREAM CROSSINGS IDENTIFIED FOR ASSESSMENT ON THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM IN THE RANGE OF SALMON AND STEEL HEAD IN CALIFORNIA. ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE ASSESSMENTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. OF THESE ONE THOUSAND FIFTY SEVEN NEED MORE DETAILED OR SECOND PASS ASSESSMENTS DETERMINE VERY STATUS. REQUIRES PERMISSION TO ENTER FOR DETAILED ASSESSMENT NEEDS FOUR HUNDRED FEET UP OR DOWN STRING. FIVE THOUSAND EIGHTY EIGHT LOCATIONS NEED RECONNAISSANCE FIRST PASS ASSESSMENT. IN JULY INITIATE A CONTRACTOR THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS TO EXCEL RIGHT THAT FIRST PASS RECONNAISSANCE IT'S A THREE YEAR CONTRACT FOR ONE POINT TWO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. TWENTY EIGHTEEN ACCOMPLISHMENTS ALTHOUGH THE FIRST BEST REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED TO YOU SHORTLY I WILL PROVIDE YOU THE INFORMATION THAT'S IN THAT REPORT. WE HAVE IMPROVE ACCESS TO PROSS ME THIRTY ONE MILES OF SALMON AND STEELHEAD HABITAT BY COMPLETING FIVE MEDIATION PROJECTS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. A HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN ASSESSMENTS WERE COMPLETED OF THOSE WE% IDENTIFIED FOURTEEN NEW BARRIERS. EIGHTY FIVE NINE BEARS AND SIXTY EIGHT LOCATIONS THAT REQUIRE MORE DETAILED SURVEYS. THE NEW FISH PASSAGE OF ISAAC COMMITTEE BEGAN IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND COVERS THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WE HAVE DEVELOPED INNOVATIVE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS TO STANDARDIZE SMALL BRIDGES AND ASSISTANT ACCELERATION AND COST REDUCTION OF FULL SPAN SOLUTIONS PROFESSED PASSAGE FOR MEDIATION. THESE PRE DESIGNED STANDARD PLANS FISH BASHERS INCLUDE ELEVEN STANDARD DESIGNS FOR BRIDGES TWENTY TO HUNDRED FEET HUNDRED FIFTEEN FEET LONG. THEY ARE CURRENTLY IN THE FINAL DESIGN STAGES AND SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR FULL DEPLOYMENT. NEXT YEAR. WE'VE ADDITIONAL COORDINATION WITH APARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IN NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE CALTRANS FERNS FISH PASSAGES YEARS AT THESE AGENCIES AND THEY PARTICIPATE IN AN INTERNET AGENCY FISH PASSAGE ENGINEERING WORK GROUP. THAT MEETS MONTHLY TO COORDINATE ON ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED IN SUPPORT EDUCATION AND DESIGN SOLUTIONS. SO IF YOU FOR TO THE SCREEN HERE'S EXAMPLES OF TYPICAL STATE HIGHWAY FISH BARRIERS. CONNECTS I'D IN HERE ARE EXAMPLES OF TYPICAL SMALL BRIDGE REMEDIATION OR THE FULL SPAN SOLUTION THAT OUR EARLIER SPEAKERS WERE TALKING ABOUT. TWO OF THE FIVE CEDAR CREEK AND THEN MENDOCINO COUNTY WAS COMPLETED. THE NEXT IS JOE COME MONEY CREEK IN MARIN COUNTY. IT IS A TRIBUTARY TO ELENA CREEK IN MARIN COUNTY. THE CARPENTER CREEK IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. THE SAN JUAN CREEK IN ORANGE COUNTY. THE SIX FISH PASSAGE INJURY WORKSHOPS CONVENE WITH TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FISH PASSAGE BIOLOGIST ENGINEERING PARTNERS IN JULY AND AUUST OF TWENTY NINETEEN. IF FOCUSING ON FUNDING IN IMPLEMENTATION TRANSPORTATION FUNDING IS TIED TO SPECIFIC TRANSPORTATION ASSETS IN CENTER I'M GLAD YOU TALKED ABOUT IT BECAUSE WE NEED TO TREAT THESE BEARS AS AN ASSET. THE COST OF BERRY MEDIATION CAN BE HIGH IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF EIGHT TO TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THESE FULL SPAN REMEDIATION. AS COMPARED TO THE COST IMPROVING TRAINING COAL TRAINS COVERTS WHICH YOU COULD BE IN THE BALLPARK OF A MILLION TO THREE MILLION DOLLARS. THE DELIVERY THESE PROJECT TAKES FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS TO DEVELOP PERMIT IN CONSTRUCTION. STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THESE FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES. BERMAN IN SPANISH SOLUTIONS WERE STANDARD DESIGNS TO IMPROVE THE REMEDIATION SOLUTIONS AND REDUCE ENGINEERING CALL US ONE STANDARD DESIGNED TO ESTABLISH PROGRAMMATIC PERMITTING SOLUTIONS CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED. WE'RE FEASIBLE USES STANDARD BRIDGE SOLUTIONS OR FULL SPAN PRIORITY LOCATIONS TO REDUCE PROJECT TIME AND COST TO REDUCE LONG TERM MAINTENANCE AND A FULLY REMEDIATE FISH PASSAGE. I BELIEVE WE ALSO HAVE A NEXUS THERE WERE WERE- WILDLIFE CONNECTIVITY CAN ALSO. OCCUR. WE'RE EXPLORING FISH PASSAGE SOLUTIONS FOR MITIGATION CREDIT TO FURTHER LINE FISH PASSAGE MEDIATION NEEDS WITH CURRENT TRANSPORTATION FUNDING. CALTRANS IS DISCUSSING THIS APPROACH WITH HIS AGENCY PARTNERS THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. INCORPORATING FISH PASSAGE VERY LOCATIONS INTO ASSET MANAGEMENT BY PAIRING TEN YOUR BOOK OF PLAN PROJECTS IN THE STATE HIGHWAY OPERATION PROTECTION PROGRAM WITH PRIORITY FISH PASSES LOCATIONS AND FACILITY NEEDS. FUNNY TARGETS WERE ADJUSTED- TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SIXTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR FULL SPAN SOLUTIONS FOR PRIORITY FISH PASSAGE LOCATIONS TEN OF THE SIXTY EIGHT IN THE UPCOMING YEARS. I'VE DIRECTED MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE UPDATED COVERT ASSESSMENTS ON ALL SIXTY EIGHT PRIORITY LOCATIONS BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THIS ALLOWS TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO SPEAKERS-AT SYNCHRONIZE FIX OUR FIRST PROJECTS WITH FISH PASSAGE PRIORITIES. WELL PERFORMANCE TARGETS IMPROVING FISH PATCHES IS ONE OF THE MANY REQUIREMENTS THE DEPARTMENT'S TASK WITH MEETING WITH A FINANCIALLY CONSTRAIN PLAN. CALTRANS IS INCORPORATING FIVE PRIORITY FISH PASSAGE LOCATIONS INTO THE ASSET MANAGER PLAN IN THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM MANAGER PLANNED WITH CLEAR PERFORMANCE TARGETS. THIS WILL HELP FISH BUDGET PRIORITIES BE CONSIDERED ALONGSIDE WITH OTHER TRANSPORTATION PARTIES AND OTHER COST PRESSURES. SINCE ANGEL CENTER MEDIATION TARGETS FOR PERFORMANCE BY YEAR THROUGH A TRANSPARENT PROCESS FOR PRIORITY FISH PASSAGE LOCATIONS. WILL EFFICIENTLY ALIGNED TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS WITH FISH PASSAGE IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIES. CALTRANS EXPORT OPPORTUNITIES FOR MITIGATION CREDITS CALTRANS HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN A LINE EFFORTS RELATED FISH PASTORS PRIORITY LOCATIONS AND STORMWATER PERMIT REQUIREMENTS. IN CALTRANS IS EXPORTED FEDERAL AND OTHER FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES. IN SUMMARY A VERY EXCITED HERE TO BE HERE TODAY WITH THIS FISH PASSAGE PROGRAM AT CALTRANS HAS MATURED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST TEN PLUS YEARS THROUGH THE SAYS ONE OF BEARS IDENTIFICATION OF EFFICIENT ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS THE FORMATION OF PARTNERSHIPS TO IMPROVE SCIENCE AND DATA. AND IDENTIFICATION OF PRIORITIES CALTRANS IS DEDICATED TO EXCEL IN BERRY REMOVAL TO MORE QUICKLY IMPROVE ACCESS TO HABITAT IN THE COMING YEARS FULLY INTEGRATING FISH PASSENGER TRANSPORTATION PLANNING ASSET MANAGEMENT AND DELIVERY IS KEY FOR INCREASING FUTURE PROGRESS. AFTER I AM DONE SPEAKING ANY BAILEY OUR CHIEF OF OUR MENTAL WILL TELL YOU MORE ABOUT HOW WE PLAN PROJECTS AND PRIORITIZE THEM WHICH WE FALL BY MIKE KEEPER- WHO WILL TELL. YOU ABOUT OUR WHAT WE'RE DOING TO EXCEL RIGHT BUDGET DELIVERY. WITHOUT OPEN UP TO QUESTIONS FOR NOTHING SO MUCH AS YOU TO PROJECT YOUR SO TALK WITH ME ABOUT THE THREE YEAR CONTRACT WITH THE CONSERVATION CORPS SCOPE A CONTRACT IN WHAT IS GOING TO BE COMPLEX AT THE END OF THOSE THREE YEARS. THE CONSUMMATE IS TO ACCELERATE THE AMOUNT OF- FIRST PASSAGE ASSESSMENTS THAT WE'RE DOING. ON THOSE ON THOSE PROJECTS. AND MISS BAILEY MAYBE CAN GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION TO FOR YOUR QUESTION SIR. PLEASE MISS BAILEY. SURE YOU HAVE PART OF THE PROGRAM WHAT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IS IT GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FISH PASSAGE ASSESSMENT COMMITTEE MEMBERS ACT AS MENTORS AND TRAINING THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS MEMBERS. TO BE ABLE TO DO THE FIRST PASS ASSESSMENTS. THERE'S ALSO SOME INCLUSION OF HABITAT QUALITY ASSESSMENTS AS PART OF THE CONTRACT MISS REALLY SO- EXPLAINED TO ME MIGRANTS AND APOLOGIZE WHEN YOU SAY FIRST PASS ASSESSMENT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR YOU IT CALTRANS AND THEN HOW DOES THIS MOVE THE PROCESS EXPEDITE THE PROCESS. THE FIRST PASS ASSESSMENTS ARE PRELIMINARY RECONNAISSANCE ASSESSMENTS OF A BARRIER LEAGUE TYPE IF THERE'S THEIR WHAT'S THERE IS IT A BARRIER IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ANSWER. AND IN SOME CONDITIONS AT SOME SITUATIONS IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT ITS BARRIER WE DON'T NEED A NEW TO DO FURTHER ASSESSMENTS OTHER OTHER SITUATIONS. MORE INFORMATION IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE IF IT IS A BARRIER OR NOT. SO WITH THE THREE YEAR CONTRACT. WHAT HAVE YOU REQUIRED THAT THE CONSERVATION CORPS COMPLETE. WE HAVE CREATED A PLANS FOR WHICH LOCATIONS WE'D LIKE TO ASSESS FIRST BECAUSE IT'S A NEW PROGRAM WE'RE JUST GETTING UP AND RUNNING WITH THE TRAINING ASPECTS THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW QUICKLY. THEY CAN ASSESS THEM SO WE DON'T HAVE A CURRENT BURN RATE OF YOU KNOW LIKE MONTHLY COMPLETIONS- BUT WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU AN UPDATE OF THAT AS WE MOVE TROUGH THE CONTRACT IMPLEMENTATION BUT WITHIN THE CONTRACT IS IT SAY THAT AND I'M MAKING THIS UP RIGHT DOES IT SAY THAT YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO DO. FORTY IN THREE YEARS. NOW IT ALLOWS FOR I BELIEVE AND- WHEN I CHECKED THIS BUT I BELIEVE UP TO TWELVE A PERSON NOW. TO BE OFFENDED THROUGHOUT THE DIFFERENT- CORE LOCATIONS. I TO THEN LEAD TEAMS TO DO THE IMPLEMENTATION OCCUR. IN THE PRE DESIGNED BRIDGES. WHAT IS THE GUIDE IN JUST A FEW OTHER QUESTIONS WILL GO TO MISS BAILEY I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE ALL OF THE PRE DESIGNED BRIDGES WHAT PERCENT OF PROJECTS US ME CAN BE. I AND- CORRECTED WITH THE PRE DESIGN VERSUS NOT. I THINK IT'S OUR OUR OUR SHIFT FROM- PARTIAL DESIGNED TO FULL SPAN DESIGN IN OUR COMMITMENT IS WHERE FEASIBLE TO GO TO THE FULL SPAN DESIGN BECAUSE I THINK WE SEE. A NEXUS FOR ALL KINDS OF IMPROVEMENT TO WILDLIFE CONNECTED THE WEATHER'S FISH OR OR FOR LEGGETT- CREATURES OKAY SO- I GUESS I WAS TAKING YOUR PRE DESIGN IS THAT YOUR YOU'RE DOING A DESIGN THAT COULD BE TO EAT. THAT COULD BE DEPLOYED. IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE NOW. YES SIR WE'RE LOOKING AT- SPAM LINKS OF TWENTY TO HUNDRED FIFTEEN FEET HER. TO BUILD- COME IN AND KIND OF PLUG AND PLAY YEAH VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT MISTER LANCASTER WAS TALKING ABOUT USING STANDARD DESIGNS. OF COURSE OUR STANDARD DESIGNS HAVE TO DEAL WITH SEISMIC- VULNERABILITY AND SEISMIC DESIGN AND HANDLE BIG LOADS IN THOSE TYPES OF THINGS SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT- DIFFERENT BUT THE SAME IDEA OF MUCH MORE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO RE ENGINEER YOU SOLUTION CAN USE STANDARD DESIGNED TO PULL OFF THE SHELF AND PLUG AND PLAY A MOVE FOR FAT AND MOVE FASTER PRE FAB RIGHT YEAH SO. THIS IS USE A SIXTY EIGHT FOR EXAMPLE THE E. MENTION SO ADDO SIXTY EIGHT. DEPLOYED USING THIS THE PRE ALLOWS USE THE PRE FAB. HAVE YOU DONE THAT ASSESSMENT WHAT I'M TRYING TO GET TO IS- YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO COVER. EXPERTS ST OF- BLOCKAGES WITH THE PRE FAB- PRODUCT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE. MOVING FORWARD WITH YOU HAVE YOU DONE THAT ASSESSMENT NO WE HAVE NOT DONE THAT IS OKAY. SO ON THE PRE FAB HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU THINK THAT'S GOING TO CUT OFF OF THE PROJECT. I'D LIKE TO REFER THAT TO MR KEEVER TO ADDRESS THAT THANK YOU IT'LL BE IN MY PRESENTATION CENTER MCGUIRE BUT SORRY QUESTION NOW BUT WE HOPE TO- REDUCE THE TIME FRAME IN FOR FULL DELIVERY BY TWO YEARS OR MORE. OKAY. DE RANDAMIE DEF STILL THE THUNDER AND I APOLOGIZE I I'M GONNA KEEP GOING THERE THOUGH AS LONG AS WE HAVE IN THIS DORMS KEEPER THAT'S OKAY SO THEN. TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT NEXT STEP SO YOU. THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR SAID. YOU MOVE ON THE PRE FAB. AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TWELVE DESIGNS. WE'LL BE ABLE TO GO ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FOUR TO ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN FOOT WITH ABOUT A DOZEN STANDARD DESIGNS THAT WILL BE READY TO GO OR COULD BE MODIFIED FOR THE SITE OCCUR SO BE BOTH THE ENGINEERING AND THE DETAILS. WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP OF FIGURING OUT FOR THESE. AGAIN I'M JUST BEING OVERLY GENERIC RIGHT THE PRE FAB THE TWELVE DESIGNS. OUT OF THE MOST CRITICAL PROJECTS. IS GONNA HIT THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND THEN. DOING THE PRO THE ROUTE THE PROGRAMMATIC E. I. R. A. NOR THE PERMITTING WHATEVER IT MAY HAVE TO BE- HOW LONG IS THAT PROCESS TAKER OF YOUR KICK THAT OFF- SUBMIT TO LEAN ON ON- IN ME FOR PART OF THIS BUT- WE- RELY ON WORKING WITH THE FISH PACKS TO TRY TO FIND WHAT IS THE BEST SOLUTION FOR EACH SITE. AND SO WE DO THINK AS OPPOSED TO MAYBE WHAT WE'VE DONE PREVIOUSLY IT'S GOT OPEN UP MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FULL SPAN AND FEWER OF THE PARTIAL SOLUTIONS THAT'S GOOD FOR US- BOTH FROM A LONG TERM READ LES MAINTENANCE- ANY BETTER ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOME. WE ALSO HOPE AS WE DEFINE THE PROCESS AND HAVE SOME CERTAINTY WITH THE STANDARDIZED DESIGNS WAY BE ABLE TO WORK WITH NAMES AND- CALIFORNIA FISH AND WILDLIFE AND GET PROGRAMMATIC PERMITS SIMILAR TO WHAT- MISTER LANCASTER TALKED ABOUT THAT THEY'RE DOING- THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO REDUCE THE TIME IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS AS WELL. TOO MANY ITEMS I'D BE INTERESTED IN IS THAT. THAT TWO YEARS THAT SQUISH YEARS THAT FIRM DO YOU BELIEVE- AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO CUT THE TIME LINE OFF OF A APPROVAL PROJECT WHAT'S YOUR GUT. IT'S GOT YEAH HELLO SO- BUT THERE'S MULTIPLE PLACES WE THINK WE CAN CUT SO IT'S THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS BECAUSE WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER UP FRONT SO WE GET THESE PERMITS- AGREEMENTS UP FRONT. WE KNOW WHAT WHAT ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOME WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. THE DESIGN PROCESS IS REDUCED OVER TIME IN DEVELOPING THE PLANS- IS LESS AND THEN THE TIME IN CONSTRUCTION AND I'LL BE ABLE TO SHOW A SLIDE FURTHER ON BUT ONE OF THE SUCCESSES- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD THE BRIDGE IN IN. FROM THE TIME THE FOUNDATIONS WERE DONE IN OUR PILOT PROJECT AND IT TOOK SOME TIME TO DO THE FOUNDATIONS BUT ONCE WE GOT THE MAN. WE BUILT THE BRIDGE IN TWENTY THREE DAYS. THESE CLEARLY CAN GET IN AND GET OUT BETWEEN THE SALMON RUNS AND POTENTIALLY YOU COULD HAVE A CONTRACTOR THAT COULD DO MULTIPLE SITES. BETWEEN DURING THE DRY SEASON AND REALLY TRY TO EXPEDITE THESE AND PACKAGE. PROJECTS THAT- WE GET SEVERAL PROJECTS DONE OLD HELPING US WITH SCHEDULE AND REDUCING OUR COSTS. SO I'M GONNA LOOK AT- I'M JUST GOING TO USE AN EXAMPLE HERE SO I'M LOOKING AT- CEDAR CREEK. I THINK THAT WAS THE BE DIRECTORS FOR SLIDE A NINETEEN. SO. WOULD YOU THINK THIS WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF. THE CANDIDATE FOR PRE FAB. THE SUCH A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE WE WILL WITH A PARTIAL SOLUTION HERE'S A GOOD PARTIAL- SOLUTION- EVERY. SURGEON JENNER YOU THINK YOU CAN DO ANYTHING BUT- THIS ONE COULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A CHALLENGE AND I THINK THE FISH PACKED DID DECIDE THAT THE PARTIAL SOLUTION AT THIS POINT WAS THE BEST SOLUTION WE AND IS WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN THE SHOW ME EXAMPLE DISCUSS IS IT THE NEXT FLIGHT TO SHOW ME AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT YOU THINK WE'LL CERTAINLY HERE. OKAY SO THIS WOULD BE A PRE THAT GUY ABSOLUTELY SO HERE WE ARE WE HAVE A CLEAR BARRIER- SPANNING OVER THAT IS WHERE YOU'RE NOT TLKING ABOUT SOMETHING WHERE THE CULVERT OR SOMETHING IS FIFTY SIXTY FEET THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE OUR CHALLENGES WHERE IT'S NOT VERY ECONOMIC OKAY CULVERTS BURIED DEEP BELOW THE ROADWAY ELEVATION. BUT A LOCATION LIKE THIS VERY CONDUCIVE OKAY. AND I APPRECIATE IT HAS ALWAYS TO THESE FOR ME SEEN THE VISUAL WHAT. WHAT IS BECOME FOR SO ONE OF THE QUESTION THE ONE A FALSE I HAVE IN A SCENE THAT YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO. LOOK AT THIS IS I'D LIKE TO GET A BETTER HAS SEEN ESPECIALLY IN THOSE ARE CALLED THE SIXTY EIGHT. LOW HANGING FRUIT PROJECTS WHAT PERCENT. EVEN COULD BE. ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE PRE FAB BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT- IT IS A SITE THAT YOU GO OUT AGAIN MAKING THIS UP AT THIS POINT RIGHT- IS THE FACT THAT YOU GO OUT AND SAY TO. YOU PUT SOMETHING OUT TO BED OF. WE DO. AGAIN MAKING IT UP. TEN CREEKS. I UNDER ONE CONTRACTOR WITH THESE HAVE TO BE INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS- SO IF YOU'RE LOKING AT. TEN DIFFERENT CROSS SCENES. IN HUMBLE COUNTY THAT YOU KNOW. PRE FAB COULD WORK WITH HYPOTHETICAL. YOU DO THAT ON ONE CONTRACT COULD YOU TO BE TO EXPEDITE THIS OR DOES IT HAVE TO BE INDIVIDUAL. MY LAST QUESTION AND I PROMISE I'LL TURN HEARTLESS BAILEY'S ON THE PROGRAM ATTIC SIDE. TALK ME THROUGH. TIMELINE TO BE A FIGURE OUT HOW THAT WORKS BEFORE WE START ENGAGING THE RESOURCE AGENCIES. SO CONTRACTING THESE PROJECTS TO DO MORE THAN ONE AT A TIME. SURE CENTER I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT FROM A CONTRACTING PERSPECTIVE IN AND AS LONG AS WE HAVE A FIX IT FIRST NEXUS I THINK. PULLING PROJECTS TOGETHER MAKES SENSE TO DO THAT I THINK THERE'S AN ECONOMY OF SCALE OF DOING A DEPENDING ON LOCATION USUALLY HAVE TO HAVE LOCATIONS ARE FAIRLY CLOSE TOGETHER FOR THE CONTRACTOR WHEN THEY MOBILIZING GO OUT AND DO THESE TYPES OF THINGS AND SO. THAT ALL FACTORS IN TWO LOCATIONS IN SOME OF THE SIXTY EIGHT SPAN ALL IN UP ALL OF LL THE WAY UP AND DOWN THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO AS NOT ALWAYS CONDUCIVE TO DOING THAT BUT BUT CERTAINLY- AND LOOKING AT OTHER. METHODOLOGIES ARE CMG SEE YOUR CONSTRUCTION MANAGER GENERAL CONTRACTOR. IS IT AN ALTERNATE PROCUREMENT THAT WE CAN USE GETTING THE CONTRACT ON BOARD TO FIGURE OUT- HOW DO WE MORE EFFICIENTLY CONSTRUCT- THESE THINGS. ARE THE DISEASE'S THESE BRIDGES- BEING IN CONSULTATION WITH OUR RESOURCE PARTNERS OUT THERE I THINK THAT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY THERE AS WELL. AND IT. REALLY AT TO TRY TO ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION REGARDING THE PROGRAMMATIC- WE'VE ALEADY KICKED OF DIALOGUES WITH THE NATIONAL FISHERIES SERVICE AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AVERAGING ONE. ON PROGRAMMATIC- AND IT HELPED INFORM THE EFFORTS THAT WERE TO UNDER GOING WITH- ENGINEERING SERVICES ON- THE STANDARD DESIGN SOLUTIONS AND THEN- AN ASSOCIATE IT AND PYLE STRIKE ANALYSIS SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND. GIVEN THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SUBSTRATES AND WHAT KIND OF FOUNDATIONS- WOULD BE NEEDED AND THE ASSOCIATED AND STRIKES FOR PILES. THAT ALL OF THAT HELPS US DESCRIBE THE ACTION IN THE CONSULTATIONS WITH THE RESOURCE AGENCIES SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A THAT STANDARD APPROACH AND THEN THEY ARE ABLE TO. PERMIT OUR OR ENTER INTO THE CONSULTATION AGREEMENT WITH US- AND PROGRAMMATIC LEVEL. SAID AT THE TIME LINE ON THAT IS AND KNOWN UNTIL WE CAN PRESENT THE INFORMATION WITH THE STANDARD DESIGNS BEING COMPLETED AND. THAT PILE STRIKE ANALYSIS I MENTIONED. ARE YOU LOOKING ATTY. HEAR WHAT IT WHAT WHAT'S YOUR AGAIN HOLD NEW TO THIS RIGHT BUT JUST YOUR GUIDE IS. A SIX MONTH PROCESS A TWO YEAR PROCESS AND WHEN YOU'RE PROCESS WHAT YOUR GUIDE. AND HATE TO COMMIT THE AGENCIES TO I'M NOT LOOKING FOR AN ITEM THAT I WAS TRYING TO BE HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN COMPLETE IT WITHIN THE NEXT TWO YEARS OKAY. YEAH I'M IN MY LAST QUESTION BEFORE TURN OVER YOU AYE AYE LATER THEIR AND I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE AND THAT WAS WILL LAST. TO WARMER TEMPS. MISTER DEPUTY SAID ALL SIXTY EIGHT LOCATIONS BY IN THE YEAR CAN YOU JUST TELL YOU WHAT YOU HOPE TO WRAP UP IN IS AT TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN OR TWENTY TWENTY. IT IS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SO WE HAVE SIXTY EIGHT HIGH PRIORITY FISH PASTORS BEARS HOME AND SO WHAT I'VE ASKED MY MAIN IS TEAM TO GO BACK BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A NEXUS WOULD FIX IT FIRST ON TEN OF. THE SIXTY EIGHT MMHM BUT SOME OF THOSE. FIX THE FIRST INVESTIGATIONS HAVE NOT OCCURRED. OR IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE THE LAST OCCURRED SO THERE MAY BE DEGRADATION IN THE PIPE ITSELF THAT COULD LEAD TO AN ACCESS FOR US GOING ON FIX IT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS GO OUT AND GET THAT NEXUS- TO SEE I WILL TELL YOU THAT FOURTEEN OUT OF THE SIXTY EIGHT ARE ACTUALLY BRIDGES. AND SO WE HAVE TO SOME MORE- INVESTIGATION ON WHAT THE BEARS ARE THAT IN SO WE ALREADY HAVE- BRIDGES NOW WHETHER THERE'S APPEAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STRING BAD OR- WHAT WHAT'S CAUSING THAT WE HAVE TO DO. A LITTLE MORE RESEARCH ON THAT. WE JUST GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AND SEE IF WE CAN FIND. ADDITIONAL CULVERTS- OR BRIDGES THAT WE NEED THAT THAT ARE IN DISTRESS- OR AS SOME DEGRADATION THAT WE GO JEAN USED TO FIX THE FIRST MONEY TO GO OUT THERE AND FIX AND HAVE- HAVE WHEN. IT'S GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A PROJECTOR AND TURN IT OVER NOW- TO IMMEDIATELY- AND JUST WANT TO SAY THANKYOU MISS BAILEY WHOSE. OF FOCUSING ON ALL ISSUES OF BIOLOGICAL PLANING. ADVANCED MEDICATION INNOVATION. WITH CALTRANS IF I MEANS MAN FOR YOURS. THANK YOU SENATOR. MY NAME IS AMY BAILEY AND I'M NOT OFFICE HE FOR THE OFFICE OF STRATEGIC BIOLOGICAL PLANNING ADVANCE MITIGATION INNOVATION. GERMAN PROVIDED AN OVERVIEW OF THE FISH PASSAGE PROGRAMMING PROJECTS I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT OUR FISH PASSAGE ADVISORY COMMITTEES. HOW WE PRIORITIZE FISH PASSAGE BARRIERS. ARE ADVANCEMENTS IN SCIENCE AND DATA AND OUR SUCCESSES FROM PARTNERSHIPS. I THE SIX FISH PASSAGE ADVISORY COMMITTEES ARE A JOINT EFFORT BETWEEN CAL TRANS CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE NAZARIAN FISHERIES SERVICE AND OTHER INTERESTED ADVOCATES SUCH AS US FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE. CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORES COASTAL CONSERVANCY TROUT UNLIMITED PACIFIC STATES MARINE FISHERIES COMMISSION AND OTHERS. FOR FISH PASSAGE EFFORTS. THE FIRST WAS ESTABLISHED IN DISTRICT ONE ALONG THE NORTH COAST IN TWO THOUSAND THREE AND THE MOST RECENT WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE PURPOSE IS TO SHARE SCIENCE AND DATA AND KNOWN FISH PASSAGE BARRIERS DEVELOP METHODS TO PRIORITIZE LOCATIONS FOR ASSESSMENTS AND BIOLOGICAL PRIORITIES FOR REMEDIATION. AT QUARTERLY MEETINGS WITH EIGHT TRACKS STATUS OF ACTIVE IN FUNDED BERRIER REMEDIATION EFFORTS FROM PLANNING FOR POST CONSTRUCTION. AND ENSURE THE BARRIERS ARE ASSESSED AND DOCUMENTED PRIOR TO PROJECT DESIGN. THIS COLLABORATION OF X. EXPERTS ADVOCATES AND PARTNERS INCLUDE A HUNDRED EIGHTY MEMBERS ALL WITH THE COLLECTIVE GOAL OF ADDRESSING TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS WITH LONG TERM SOLUTIONS THAT FACILITATE FISH PASSAGE. THIS PASSAGE ADVISORY COMMITTEES DEVELOP METHODS TO IDENTIFY BIOLOGICAL PRIORITIES FOR REMEDIATING FISH CARRIERS. THIS BIOLOGICAL PRESERVATION FOR RECOVERY IS BASED ON BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN COORDINATION WITH CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND NATURAL FISHRIES SERVICE. RESERVATION INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF SPECIES INFORMATION INCLUDING PRESENTS OUR HISTORIC PRESENCE OF SALMON AND STEEL HEAD SPECIES. DIVERSITY OF SALMON AND STEEL HEAD AND LISTING STATUS. IT ALSO INCLUDES THE SUITABLE HABITAT C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AT UPS.&lt;/c&gt;</u> BOTH QUALITY AND QUANTITY INCLUDING VALUES SUCH AS COOL WATER AND VELOCITY REFUGIA MATURE NATIVE RIGHT PERRY IN VEGETATION AND FEATURES SUCH AS RIFLES POOL AND CLEAN WASH GRAVEL. YET INCLUDES OTHER KNOWLEDGE OF EXPERTS AND LOCAL PROFESSIONALS. THEY USE THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND DATA AND IT'S REFINED OVER TIME. AS PARTY LOCATIONS ARE FUNDED THEIR MOVED TO THE ACTIVE PROJECT LIST AND NEW PRIORITY BARRIERS ARE ADDED TO THE LIST. I WANT TO TOUCH ON SOME INNOVATIONS FOR IMPROVE SCIENCE AND DATA THIS YEAR A PILOT FISH PASSAGE BARRIER AND HABITAT EVALUATION FORM WAS CREATED. IT ASSIST WITH IDENTIFYING SPECIFIC BERRIER ELEMENTS IN AIDS IN DETERMINING THE SUITABILITY QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF HABITAT YOUR FISH BARRIERS. IT HELPS WITH IDENTIFICATION AND FOCUS ON BARRIER LOCATIONS WITH THE GREATEST LIKELY BENEFITS FOR SPECIES RECOVERY. END OF PHIL'S BIOLOGICAL DATA GAPS THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FIRST AND SAYS SECOND PASS ASSESSMENTS IN THE FISH PACK PASSAGE ASSESSMENT DATABASE. THE FORM INCLUDES WATERSHED MAPPING AND MODELLING WHICH ALLOWS US TO ESTIMATE LIKELY ACCESSIBLE HABITAT. AND THERE'S ALSO INFORMATION AVAILABLE FOR MULTI SPECIES BENEFITS THAT CAN BE PROVIDED. I THE DIGITAL DATA COLLECTED AND COORDINATED THAT DIRECTLY INFORMS PRESERVATION EFFORTS. FISH PACKS CONTINUE ANNUAL IN PERSON TRAINING EVENTS AND WEBINARS ON FISH PASSAGE REMEDIATION INCLUDING BRIDGES AND BIOLOGY SCIENCE AND DATA FISH PASSAGE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS AND PERMITTING. THE HUMBOLDT STATE UNIVERSITY ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT IS CONDUCTING A TWO YEAR RESEARCH EFFORT THAT CALTRANS FUNDED INVESTIGATE THE FUNCTION OF IMPLEMENTED FISH PASSAGE SOLUTIONS. THE RESEARCH PANEL CONSIST OF CALTRANS CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND NAZARIAN FISHERIES SERVICE ENGINEERING EXPERTS WHO ALSO PARTICIPATE IN THE INTERN AGENCY FISH PASSAGE ENGINEERING GROUP. FISH PACKS IN THE INTERAGENCY FISH PASSAGE ENGINEERING GROUP PROVIDING CONSISTENT VENUE FOR SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE SHARING OF SCIENCE DATA AND ENGINEERING EXPERTISE. AND COORDINATION WITH CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE NAZARIAN FISHERIES SERVICE AND OTHERS. A SUPPORT MULTI DISCIPLINARY COORDINATION FOR SCOPING DEVELOPING PERMITTING IMPLEMENTING AND MONITORING SPECIFIC BERRY REMEDIATION PROJECTS AND EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE AND NAZARIAN FISHERIES SERVICE ENGINEERS THAT JIM MENTIONED THAT WE FIND THEY REVIEW PROJECT DESIGNS AND COURTNEY AND APPROVE ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS. AND WE ALSO LOOK TO PARTNERING EFFORTS FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCES THROUGH VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL ENHANCEMENT GRANTS. I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THE PARTNERSHIPS AT PACIFIC STATES MARINE FISHERIES COMMISSION HAS PROVIDED CONSTANT SUPPORT FOR DATA MAPPING AND NEW TOOLS FOR EFFICIENCIES AND ASSESSMENTS. THEY MANAGE THE PASSAGE ASSESSMENT DATABASE AND THIS PROVIDES FOR SEAMLESS DATA COMMUNICATION WITH CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. WE'VE SPOKEN A BIT ABOUT THE CAN'T CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS. AND AS THE THEN. THE HOPES THAT WE HAVE FOR AND ED COMPLETING AN ADDITIONAL FIRST PASS ASSESSMENT ASSESSMENT AND TRAINING AND PROFESSIONALS. VEHICLE CREEK AN ACTIVE PROJECT IN DISTRICT TWELVE ORANGE COUNTY IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF PARTNERING THAT HAS TRANSLATED INTO SUPPORT AND CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR OTHER FUNDING FROM PROGRAM AND PARTNERS. CONTRIBUTIONS FROM CALCUTTA WHILE I PROP ONE GRANT NATIONAL FISH AND WILDLIFE FOUNDATION GRANT AND THE CALIFORNIA WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD AT GRANTS TOTAL APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS ADDITIONALLY CALTRAIN IT IS MANAGING THIS PROJECT. IN DISTRICT TWO SISKIYOU COUNTY A GRANT FROM YOU SEE DARK THE US DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR HAS PROVIDED ADD TO THIS WITH PLANNING SKIPPING AND PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS FOR BOTH KATE AND PORTUGUESE. CREEKS. DIMENSIONS ANALYST AT STRATEGIES TO INCREASE THE PACE OF REMEDIATION FISH PASSAGE REMEDIATION HAS BEEN FUNDED AS MEDICATION FOR NEARBY OFFSITE BARRIERS THAT WERE OTHERWISE IN GOOD CONDITION. CURRENTLY DEL NOR ONE OH ONE SMITH RIVER BRIDGE REPLACEMENT IS DEVELOPING DOMINI CREEK AS MITIGATION. OTHER COMPLETED PASSAGE REMEDIATION EFFORTS FUNDED AS OFFSITE MITIGATION INCLUDE SOUTH FORK RYAN CREEK NORTH FORK RAIN CREEK AND áP CREEK. THIS STRATEGY WOULD ALLOW FOR INCREASED FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES TO REMEDIATE PRIORITY BARRIERS THAT HAVE NO TRANSPORTATION CONDITION DEFICIENCY. ALSO THERE IS INTEREST IN PURSUING DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED MITIGATION PROJECTS REMEDIATE BARRIERS WE WILL SEE POTENTIAL WITH THIS APPROACH AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING TO EXPLORING A CRACK AT CREDITING FRAMEWORK WITH OUR AGENCY PARTNERS TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND AND IMPLEMENT. WE LOOK TO CONTINUE THE SUCCESS IN A LYING FISH PASSAGE PRIORITY LOCATIONS AND STORMWATER PERMIT CREDITING REQUIREMENTS. THERE ARE SEVERAL BENEFITS TO SPENDING SOLUTIONS FOR FISH PASSAGE REMEDIATION DESIGN SUCH AS ADDRESSING BAD IN BANK CORROSION. AND SAID A MAN AND A PRE TRANSPORT WHICH REDUCE DIRECT AND INDIRECT WATER QUALITY IMPACTS SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN WITH CLAIM TO HIRING FIFTY FIVE COMPLIANT COMPLIANCE UNITS IN OUR STORM WATER MANAGEMENT ANNUAL REPORT RELATED TO FISH PASSAGE PRIORITY REMEDIATION EFFORT. LASTLY WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH NASH RE FISHERIES SERVICE IN CALIFORNIA PERMIT A FISH AND WILDLIFE REGION ONE AND DEVELOPING THE PROGRAMMATIC ENDANGERED SPECIES THAT CONSULTATION AND CONSISTENCY DETERMINATION. OF TO REDUCE TIME RELATED PERMITTING FISH PASSAGE REMEDIATION. IN ORDER TO TREAT THAT PROGRAMMATIC AGREEMENT AS MENTIONED WE NEED TO RELY ON A STANDARD DESIGNS THAT MIGHT KEEP OUR PROJECT MANAGEMENT DIVISION SHE FOR NOTE NOW GO INTO MORE DETAIL ON AND HOW WE DELIVER. THIS PASSAGE PROJECTS THANK YOU. YOU SO MUCH MISS BELLY UP MISS PHILLY YOU JUST MENTIONED THE ANNUAL REPORT SO DO. YOU HAVE A DATE WHEN HE WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT. ZERO ALL ADDRESS SAID. IT'S GOING TO FINAL REVIEWS AND YOU SHOULD SEE THAT THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS NEXT COUPLE WEEKS BEFORE. THERE IS A BEFORE CHRISTMAS. FOR CHRISTMAS ALL RIGHT. TO BE LIKE A GIFT. I DID LIKE IT AND THEN OBVIOUSLY IS GOING TO HAVE THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT IS WELL SAID TO BELIEVE THAT'S RIGHT IT WILL SIR OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH IT WILL HAVE THAT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR RANGE THAT I TALKED ABOUT. OKAY THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU IS REALLY NAGGING TURNOVER MISSED KEEPER. SHEET YOU BEING HERE TODAY SIR- IN OF COURSE IS CHIEF PROJECT MANAGER DIVISION. IN THE CHIEF HE'S CHIEF IN THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT DIVISION FOR CALTRANS FOR INTERNAL RISKY FORGET FIVE MISTER. ANDERSON REQUIRE- YOU CLEARLY KNOW THIS TOPIC YOU ANTICIPATED MUCH OF MY CONTACT APOLOGIZE RIGHT TO- JUST MY PRESENTATION OF WHAT WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT- THERE'S A LOT OF COLLABORATION- THAT- TOOK PLACE JIM MENTIONED. THE STANDARD DELIVERY TIME OF OUR BRIDGE PROJECTS IS FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS AND AMY TALKED ABOUT THE PROGRAMMATIC AGREEMENTS. WE'VE WORKED TO TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND- BOTH REDUCE OUR PROJECT DELIVERY TIME AND COST BUT ALSO IMPROVING THE ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOMES AND TRYING TO INSTITUTIONALIZE FISH PASSAGE REMEDIATION INDOOR GENERAL PRACTICE AND JIM EMPHASIZE THAT AS WELL AND SO. THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE COLLABORATION HAS HAS GONE ON. WE WERE WORKING TOGETHER- ACROSS DISCIPLINES- IN MY PREVIOUS ROLE OVER ON THE BRIDGE OFFICE WE EXCHANGED AN ENGINEER THAT WENT OVER TO THE DIVISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS TO WORK IN THEIR OFFICE. THEY IN TURN- WE HAD A BIOLOGIST COME OVER AND WORK WITH THE ENGINEERS AND THE GEOTECHNICAL PROFESSIONALS IN ORDER TO TRY TO SHARE INFORMATION AND FIND THE BEST SOLUTION GOING FORWARD. IN ADDITION WE WORKED- THERE'S BEEN REFERENCES BRIDGES- AND BIOLOGY- MELINDA MALL ARE ONE OF- AMY STAFF WORKED REALLY HARD TRYING TO STITCH TOGETHER- BOTH. THE STAKEHOLDERS AND PARTNERS ON THE OUTSIDE AS WELL AS THE INTERNAL CALTRANS GROUPS TO WORK TOGETHER TO TRY TO FIND WHERE ARE THE SOLUTIONS AND WHAT ARE THOSE- OPPORTUNITIES. AND FROM THAT CAME A THE A STANDARDIZED BANNING SOLUTIONS OR BRIDGE IN A BOX SO VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT MISTER LANCASTER WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER. AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS. ALREADY BUT AGAIN JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE DESIGN IS DONE. THE DETAILS ARE DONE NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED FOR THE SITE. BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE FAR INTO THE PROCESS FOR BOTH OF THESE. WHEN ITS PRE FABRICATED YOU CAN BRING IT OUT TO THE SIDE AND YOU CAN THINK OF IT LIKE AND I KEY A BRIDGE YOU CAN ASSEMBLE IT VERY VERY QUICKLY WHICH IS IMPORTANT- BOTH FROM A TURN IN TERMS OF- PUBLIC DISRUPTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIGHWAY PROJECTS HERE AS WELL AS TRYING TO LIMIT THE IMPACTS TO THE SITE AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND AGAIN THIS IS WHERE WE SEE THE PROGRAMMATIC OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK TOGETHER SAY WE'RE GOING TO GET IN AND GET OUT AND LIMIT OUR- IMPACTS AND WITH THE FULL SPAN SOLUTIONS- THE NEED FOR MAINTENANCE IS GREATLY REDUCED WE DON'T NEED TO GET BACK AND WE DON'T NEED A PERMIT NOR TO DO OUR OUR MAIN DISSOCIATED ACTIVITY SINCE WE SEE A LOT OF BENEFITS WITH THE- WITH THE FULL SPAN SOLUTION. WHAT AREA- CORRECT YEAH I'VE NEVER PURCHASED ANYTHING FOR AT FROM IKEA THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ASSEMBLE. SO WORSLEY OR SOME REALLY GOOD CONTRACTORS WE WORK. FACTS ARE CASH IS STILL IN THE GARAGE. PRETTY WELL. SO THE CALTRANS VERSION WHICH HOPEFULLY DRAW THIS COLLABORATION WILL LEVEL WORK VERY WELL SO. SO WE TALKED EARLIER ITS ITS ITS MULTI FACETED IN THE WAYS THAT WE CAN REDUCE BOTH COST AND TIME FROM THE- WITH WE THINK THROUGH THE COLLABORATION THE PROGRAMMATIC ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENTS THE DESIGN PROCESS TO CONSTRUCTION PROCESS. AND REDUCING THE NEED FOR MAINTENANCE ALL REDUCING TIME ALL REDUCING- COST AND WE THINK WITH A BETTER IMPROVE VARMINT ALLOW COME NOT ONLY FOR THE- SALMON AND STEEL HEAD BUT THESE TYPES OF SOLUTIONS ARE OFTEN GOOD FOR OTHER SPECIES THAT ARE ABLE TO USE THE- THAT IS A- CROSSING AREA. WE PREFER- WHEN WE CAN THE FULL SPENCER LUCIEN BUT WE HAVE- GUIDANCE MATERIAL MANUALS ARE FOR DIFFERENT HYDRAULIC SOLUTIONS THAT WE USE MANY F OUR PAST SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN THE- THE PARTIAL HYDRAULIC SOLUTIONS- WE ALSO USE STREAM SIMULATION DESIGN STRATEGIES- WHEN IT'S NOT FEASIBLE UT- WE ARE- DRIVING TO INSTITUTIONALIZE FULL SPAN WHERE IT APPEARS THAT. THE. HAVING THAT TOOL AVAILABLE TO US WHERE IT'S FEASIBLE AND IT'S THE BEST ALTERNATIVE AS WE SAID WE GO THROUGH THIS COLLABORATIVE STRATEGIZING- PROCESS CITY CAN YOU GO BACK TO THAT REAL QUICK SO. IS THAT. YOUR EIGHT TO TEN MILLION VERSUS. THIS IN MARIN GIMME. IRAN IS THE EIGHT TO TEN MILLION DOLLAR TYPE PROJECT AND IF YOU'RE DOING THE LATTER LIKE THAT ANY WHAT'S THAT- THERE'S A LOT MORE AS IT'S READ THE. THE THREE MEN WONDER WONDER THREE MILLION TYPE. OF THAT OKAY THAT'S- CHEAPER THAN THIS IS CHEAPER. BUT IT ALSO COMES OF THE MAINTENANCE COSTS AND A LIFESPAN THAT ISN'T THE SAME AS THE BRIDGE ALTERNATIVE SO WE MAY HAVE TO FIND OURSELVES GOING BACK IN CLEARING OUT- DEBRIS IN THINGS IN THERE AND THAT DEBRIS ITSELF CAN DAMAGE. THE ASSET. AND THEN IT'S NOT AS EFFECTIVE AND THEN WE NEED TO GO BACK IN AND GET ANOTHER PERMIT AND DO ANOTHER PROJECT GO THROUGH THE PROCESS AGAIN. THE WORKING POOR WE'RE MOVE TILTING TOWARD THE FULL SPAN I THINK WHEN WE CAN DO THOSE AND. AN EXAMPLE OF THE FORCE OF FULL SPAN IS THE FORD COUGH CREEK BRIDGE THIS IS DONE A FEW YEARS AGO BUT IT REALLY SET THE TONE FOR WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THE FULL SPAN. IT'S UP AND SISKIYOU COUNTY ON ROUTE- NINETY SIX- WE USED ALL PREFABRICATED COMPONENTS YOU CAN SEE THE SORT OF ON THE LEFT THAT PART OF THE SLIDE THE ORIGINALS. SITE YOU CAN SEE IN THE MIDDLE SLIDE THE PREFABRICATED- COMPONENTS BEING ASSEMBLED- AND THEN THE FINAL SOLUTION WAS A FULL SPEND SOLUTION UNATTRACTIVE BRIDGE- AND- AGAIN FROM THE TIME WE WERE COMPLETED THE FOUNDATIONS TO WHEN THEY BEGAN THE WORK YOU SEE IN THE CENTER WE WERE DOWN IN TWENTY THREE DAYS. NOW WE THINK ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THIS IS A PILOT PROJECT WE WERE LEARNING AS WE WEREGOING ON. BECAUSE OF ITS SUCCESS SO THAT'S WERE RE DECIDED TO INVEST IN THESE THESE ARE FULL SPAN SOLUTIONS AND STANDARDIZE THOSE WE THINK WE CAN DO BETTER THIS IS THIS IS THE BEGINNING. AND SO GOING FORWARD WE THINK THERE IS THERE EVEN GREATER. OPPORTUNITIES. SO JUST IN CONCLUSION WE THINK BETWEEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL. PROBLEMATIC APPROVALS THAT WE HOPE TO WORK WITH OUR OUR- PERMITTING A RESOURCE AGENCY PARTNERS ON WITH THIS UP AS A RESULT OF STANDARDIZING- THESE TYPES OF DESIGNS AND REDUCING- THE TIMELINE IN DELIVERING THESE PROJECTS WILL BE BENEFICIAL AND- AND THEN THE COSTS THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. THE TIME IN DESIGN TIME IN CONSTRUCTION AND THE- THE MAINTENANCE AND WE BELIEVE. THEY PREFERRED ENVIRONMENTAL OUTCOME- NO NEED FOR ROCK REVETMENT AND THINGS LIKE THAT. TOTAL FOR THE SIXTY EIGHT AGAIN IS. UPWARDS OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION. BALLPARK. DOES THE TOTAL OF THE TWENTY SEVEN THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THEY WERE ACTING TWENTY SEVEN BUT THEY'RE ACTIVELY WORKING ON IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THREE HUNDRED MILLION. SIXTY EIGHT WHAT WOULD THAT RUN YOU HI ESTIMATE WOULD YOU SAY LET'S JUST SAY TEN MILLION A PIECE O. SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION. AND TO TALLY. SO WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE NINE NEXUS PROJECTS IN THE TOPS SIXTY OR SEVENTY. THAT'S WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT- MITIGATION OR ADVANCED MEDICATION THAT- MISS BAILEY TALKED ABOUT AND WE'RE WORKING WITH A RESOURCE PARTNERS TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND THAT NEXUS- BECAUSE IF I CAN FIND A TRANSPORTATION ACTORS FOR MITIGATION FOR ANOTHER PROJECT AND THAT GIVES ME THE- THE A GREEN LIGHT TO GO AHEAD AND USE THAT AND FIX AND REMOVE THAT FISH PASSAGE BEAR ON THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT. IN USING THAT MITIGATION TO MITIGATE FOR ANOTHER PROJECT. AND THAT'S WERE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH WITH OUR PARTNERS RIGHT NOW. SO WHEN YOU DO THE ANALYSIS OF THE SIXTY EIGHT BY THE END OF THE YEAR YOU CAN  YOU THAT'S GOING TO GIVE YOU YOUR INVENTORY OF YOUR. CHAT YOUR REDIRECT NEXUS FOR TRANSPORTATION. VERSES THOSE THE ART THAT'S CORRECT SIR OKAY. OKAY I WILL TELL YOU THE OTHER THEY'RE STILL ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED BARRIERS THAT IF WE'VE GOT A NEXUS ARE NOT THE HIGH PRIORITY BUT THEY'RE STILL BEARS THAT IF WE ARE WORKING ON A CULVERT OF THAT HAS A VERY WE NEED TO GO AHEAD AND FIX THAT AS WELL. AND SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR THOSE AS WELL. STANDARD THOUGHT OF COMPLETING ALL SIXTY EIGHT IN HOW MANY DECADES. IF WE GO ALONG AS WE ARE NOW. CURRENTLY WERE AVERAGING APPROXIMATELY FIVE A YEAR- SO A LOT OF YEARS. ALL RIGHT. SO AT WE GOTTA FIGURE AB AND I KNOW MISTER DAVIS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE AN EXPEDITE RIGHT. WELL I THINK ALSO PT IN OUR ASSET MANAGER PLANET AND JUST LIKE WE DO WITH OTHER BRIDGES AND CULVERTS AND PAVEMENT TO ADD THAT INTO THE INVENTORY AND THEN WHEN YOU START LOOKING AT THAT YOU DO DATA ANALYTICS ON IT YOU PUT AN R. G. I. US AND SEE WHERE THERE'S OVERLAP I MEAN I JUST. I THINK IT WILL. PUT IT AT THE MAIN LINE IN STREAMLINING. INTO OUR SYSTEM- THINK WILL HELP TREMENDOUSLY IN THIS AREA AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT. CAME SO I'M HAVE SOME FOLLOW UPS HERE THAT. I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH. SO ONE OF THE ITEMS THE COMMITTEE'S GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR IS. NO IT'S STILL SQUISHY BUT RETURN WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE GONNA REDUCING THE TIME FRAME USING THE PRE FAB PROJECTS. NUMBER TWO. WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF THE SIXTY EIGHT WE CAN DEPLOY PREFAB PURSES NOT. NUMBER THREE WOULD LIKE THE IN NINE NINE OKAY HOLD MISS BAILEY TO THIS UNDERSTAND IT WAS A ROUGH MAYBE TWO YEARS FOR THE PROGRAMMATIC BUT- WHAT IS A REAL TIME LINE. FOR THAT. WE ALREADY MENTIONED THE- FIX IT FIRST VERSES AND NINE NEXUS IN TEAM WITH THAT INVENTORY IS WHICH I THINK IS GONNA BE PRETTY QUICK. THE ANNUAL REPORT IS GOING TO BE. BY CHRISTMAS. IT IS CURRENTLY RUNNING THROUGH THE PROCESS NOW. ANYWHERE THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO AND I KNOW THIS IS WHERE CALTRAIN WHAT'S GOING ON I'M LOOKING. AT THE MAP. THE PROVIDER THIS IS TOP SIXTY EIGHT ARE TOP SEVENTY PROJECT. IN THE STATE IN REALLY IT'S. YOU ARE CLUSTERED YOUR CLOTHES QUESTION ON THE NORTH STATE YOUR CLUSTERED IN THE NORTH COAST. BAY AREA IN AROUND THE LOS ANGELES REGION RIGHT. SO TOTAL NUMBER DISTRICTS YOU THINK THESE PROJECTS ARE IN WHAT WOULD YOU SAY. THE SIXTY EIGHT YEAR THEY'RE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT ALL OF THEM BUT AS THE DISTRICT ELEVEN TWELVE TWO AND ONE AND ONE AND THREE HAVE THE LEAST AMOUNT. RIGHT OKAY. SO WHAT I A YOU KNOW AGAIN I THINK WERE WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR PANEL IS- DUE TO THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE I'M HERE WITH IN THE STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM. ENDANGERED SPECIES ARE ON THE BRINK. I AND. THERE'S SO MUCH THAT WE CAN DO IS THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO HELP THE RECOVERY AT THESE FISH SPECIES BOUGHT I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES WE'RE GONNA HAVE IS DEVELOPING THAT NIGHT THOSE STRATEGY FROM THE NINE NEXUS PROJECTS IN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT REGARDLESS IF IT'S IF IT TOUCHES- IF IT AS A FIX IT FIRST INDOOR HIS NINE NEXUS. THEY'RE ALL PRIORITIES. INSIDE HOW WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO. DEVELOP THE FUNDING BILL IS FOR IN IN PARTICULAR MOVE FORWARD ON THOSE NINE NEXUS PROJECTS. BECAUSE ON THOSE- FIX IT FIRST PROJECTS MISTER DEPUTY DIRECTOR. YOU CAN USE THOSE TRANSPORTATION UP FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO FIX THAT'S CORRECT SIR. IN YOU SEE IN THERE IS YOU BELIEVE THAT. IF THERE ARE NOT STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES OR WHATEVER MAY BE WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE AT THAT ONE SPOT YOU CANNOT USE TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS I THINK OUR OUR OUR STRUGGLES SIR IS THAT- WE HAVE HUGE NEEDS A NON OF DOLLARS CURRENTLY IN A STATE OUR SYSTEM MANAGER PLAN. WE HAVE- NINETY MILLION DOLLARS IT NEEDS AN FIFTY FOUR ARE FROM NINETY BILLION DOLLARS A NATIVE FIFTY FOUR BILLION OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS AND SO IT'S BASICALLY WE HAVE A HALF OF WHAT WE NEED CURRENTLY. TO DO TO FIX OUR FIRST WORK BETTER STRUGGLE. AND OBVIOUSLY SO LIABILITY SO WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS IT LIKE. MANY OTHER LIABILITIES THAT WE HAVE IN THE SYSTEM. OKAY. ALL RIGHT I'M GONNA OFFER ICHI YOU CLOSING COMMENTS WILL START WITH THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND- HOLE IN WITH JUST A THOUGHT OF WHEN WE CAN FOLLOW UP WITH YOU TO PROJECT YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS PLEASE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SENATOR- WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON A FIX IT FIRST AND OUR FISH PASSAGE NEXUS I THINK I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT- OUR COMMITMENT AND THAT'S WHY I'VE ASKED ARMENIANS FOLKS TO GO BACK TO THE SIXTY EIGHT HIGH PRIORITY PROJECTS BY BY CHRISTMAS TIME. AND IDENTIFY SEE IF WE HAVE ANY OF THE FIX IT FIRST NEXUS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THE SIXTIETH WORKING ON CURRENTLY WORKING ON. TEN OF THOSE GOING FORWARD. ALSO WE'RE GOING TO INCLUDE- ESPECIALLY THERE'S A PART OF OUR ASSET MANAGER PLAN AND- MANAGE THAT JUST LIKE WE DO OUR BRIDGES AND CULVERTS AND- PAVEMENT. WE'RE PARTNERING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFEIN THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES- TO LOOK AT OF MEDICATION CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES ON THOSE NINE NEXUS OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE. WELL WE'RE ALSO ASKING THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION OTHERS IS- OTHER FUNDING OUT THERE MAYBE NOT OUTSIDE FEDERAL HIGHWAYS OTHERS FEDERAL FUNDING POSSIBILITIES OUT THERE SO THERE ARE CURRENTLY EXPLORING HAT FOR ME IT AS WE SPEAK FURTHER TO GET ALL OVER IT ESPECIALLY CLIMATE CHANGE. BUT YOU KNOW I THINK THE OTHER THING IS LOOK AT THE SAYS ONCE AGAIN CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS AND SEEING HOW THEY CAN HELP US XCELERATED LOOKING AT THESE ASSESSMENTS. AND FINALLY I WANT TO SIT DOWN. WITH MISTER LANCASTER FOR THE FIVE SEASON ONLY LOOK AND SEE IF THERE'S SOME OPPORTUNITIES THERE THAT WE COULD- LEVERAGE AND YOU KNOW WE'RE- WE'RE AWAYS LOOKING FOR INNOVATION THAT'S WHEN THE COMMITMENTS OF SB ONE IS FOR. CALTRANS DELIVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN FISHING SEIZE EVERY YEAR AND SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR TO BE DIRECTOR WE'RE GOING TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE- IN AGAIN I WAS A THANK YOU THAT THE TEAM FOR CALTRANS WE'VE HAD- SERVER PRE MEETINGS LEADING INTO TODAY'S HEARING AND- WILL BE FOLLOWING UP- IN JANUARY FOR ANOTHER IN PERSON MEETING.

AND THANK YOU PAGE FAIR BE FISHERIES PROGRAM MANAGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL AND RESOURCES AGENCY TANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT. I JUST WANTED TO BRIEFLY HIGHLIGHT SOMETHING THAT HASN'T BEEN MENTIONED EXPLICITLY YET TODAY MORE CLOSELY RELATES TO THIS MORNING'S CONVERSATION AND DISCUSSION. LAST WEEK AT- PC'S PUBLIC MEETINGS- COUNCIL UNANIMOUSLY UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED A STRATEGY TO PROTECT WHALES AND SEA TURTLES. AND ENSURE THRIVING FISHERIES IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH REDUCING THE RISK OF ENTANGLEMENT IN CALIFORNIA FISHING GEAR. AT A HIGH LEVEL THIS INVESTMENT STRATEGY WITH WHICH ALIGNS WITH- PC'S REMAINING FIVE POINT THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND TO ADDRESS WILL AND SEE TRAIL ENTANGLEMENT. INCLUDES ADVANCING THE FOLLOWING FOUR PILLARS. COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE YOUR INNOVATION AND ENTITLEMENT RESPONSE AN OUTREACH. THIS STRATEGY AIMS TO SUPPORT THE DUNGENESS CRAB FISHERY IN ADDITION TO OTHER STATE MANAGE FISHERIES INVOLVED IN ENTANGLEMENTS. IN PARTICULAR THIS MORNING WE HEARD ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF IMPROVING BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE INFORMING RISK ASSESSMENT. RELATED TO MARINE LIFE ENTANGLEMENT OPC IS COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING AND SUPPORTING THIS URGENT NEED AND CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ALL PARTNERS. TO PROTECT WHALES AND SEA TURTLES AND ENSURE THRIVING FISHERIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND THANKS FOR HANGING WITH US AS WELL WE SHOULD WORDS. COMING S. OUT LIVE FOR MARIN COUNTY WELCOME. IT'S GOOD TO SEE SIR- SENATOR HI MY NAME IS RICHARD JAMES OF THE CUSTODIAN AND JUST WANNA MAKE SOME BRIEF COMMENTS PLEASE PLEASE HAVE SOME PREPARE STUFF BUT THEN I ALWAYS BRING UP THINGS UNGRATEFUL COME TO MIND. I WANT TO COMMENT ON A COMMENT THAT. SMOKING MASTER MADE EARLIER AND HE SAID THAT. OREGON WASHINGTON DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY HAD A WHALE PROBLEM AND TILL THEY DID. AN I'D LIKE TO RE FRAME THAT STATEMENT AND SAY I THINK THAT IT'S PROBABLY MORE ACCURATE TO SAY THAT THE WHALES HAVE KNOWN ALL ALONG THAT THEY HAVE A HUMAN PROBLEM. YOU KNOW WE PUT THOSE ROPES IN THE OCEAN AND- THEY'VE JUST BEEN DOING THEIR THING FOR A LONG TIME SO. IF WE- YOU KNOW LOOK AT LOOK AT ISSUES FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES WE MIGHT COME TO DIFFERENT CONCLUSIONS. I WOULD LIKE SIMPLY FOR THE WORKING GROUP EFFORTS THAT THEY'VE BEEN YOU KNOW WORKING HARD TO TRY AND DEVELOP HERE. AND GET GIVES ITS LOST OUT OF THE- THE WATER AND I APPLAUD THOSE EFFORTS- AS I SHOWED YOU SEVERAL MONTHS AGO IN YOUR OFFICE I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT I HOPE THAT- MOVING FORWARD THOSE EFFORTS CAN. BE USED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF GEAR THAT GETS LOOSE AND SHOWS UP ON THE BEACH. AND YOU'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE SO THIS THIS BLL WE RIGHT HERE THIS IS ONE OF THOUSANDS THAT I PICKED UP FROM- THE BEACHES OF MORAN. AND AS YOU KNOW I TOOK ONE OF THESE MOVIES AND I ADDRESSED IT WITH A WITH A WOOD RASP. AND I TURNED THAT BILLY. INTO A JAR OF POWDER. AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE BOOTIES ON THE ROPE AND THE CRAP. THE BAIT JARS. WHEN THEY GET PUSHED UP INTO THE ROCKS ALONG THE COAST AND NO ONE PICKS THEM UP. THERE JUST TUMBLED LIKE A ROCK TUMBLER. AND IT JUST THIS IS. THE CRAB FISHERMEN NEED A HEALTHY OCEAN AS WE HEARD EARLIER. BUT CRAPPIE FISHING IS HARD ON THE OCEAN ESPECIALLY WHEN I WANT TO GEAR GETS LOOSE. AND LAST WEEK I SPOKE TO A WOMAN FROM FROM DFW. AND I LEARNED IN CALIFORNIA. THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND POTS. PERMITTED TO PUT IN THE WATER. THOSE AREN'T ALL FINISHED. BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE RANGING PAY FOR THE FISH AND THEN THEY DON'T. ABOUT A HUNDRED AND 400-002-0040 THREE THOUSAND. POTS ARE FINISHED. I'VE HEARD THAT ROUGHLY 10% OF THE GEAR GOES MISSING. SO THAT'S ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND POTS THE THAT JUST GO MISSING IN. TURN INTO DEBRIS IN THE- ALONG ALONG THE SHORES IN IN THE OCEAN IN VERY QUICKLY WRAP UP. FISHERMEN WANT TO GET BACK TO DAYS OF LOOKING FORWARD TO THE OPENER AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT YOU KNOW THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY WAS ABOUT TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE. IT'S ABOUT FORTY MILLION PEOPLE NOW. THEN WE CAN'T. KEEP EXPECTING THEOCEAN TO DELIVER. WHAT IT HAS DELIVERED. WHEN WE JUST KEEP MULTIPLYING LIKE RABBITS. AND SO WE YOU KNOW BEACH WE CAN EXPECT. THE PLANET TO JUST KEEP ON DOING WHAT IT'S BEEN DOING WHEN WE KEEP MAKING BIGGER BIGGER DEMANDS I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON US. TO FOR A LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING BECAUSE- I THINK IT'S UNREALISTIC TO EXPECT THE OCEAN IS JUST KEEP PROVIDING. WELL EVEN AT THAT. GEN ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO SAY THANK YOU- AS I'VE DONE IN THE PAST- IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN SOME OF THE PICTURES- THAT WHAT MACHINES IS PICKED UP. ALONG THE OCEAN IT'S IMPRESSIVE IN DEPRESSING I AIMED AT VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK- IN YOUR CONTINUED COMMITMENT I HAD TO BE A TO KEEP THE SHORES CLEAN SO WE'RE VERY EVERY TIME I CAN'T. CAN I SNEAK MISTAKEN ONE MORE COMMENT QUICKLY PLEASE. AS CALTRANS WAS HERE IN MY EFFORTS TO CLEAN THE OCEAN OR TO CLEAN THE BEACHES OUT MARIN I'VE FOUND THAT THE EAST BAY HOMELESS CAMPS. ARE A MAJOR SOURCE. OF DEBRIS INCLUDING MEDICAL WASTE IN THE FORM OF DIRTY SYRINGES AND I'VE BEEN I'VE MET A LOT OF MY CALTRANS ROLLED EXES GOT VERY BIG. I'VE LEARNED IS THAT MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ARE SPENT. CLEANING UP REPEATEDLY CLEANING UP ALL ALONG THE HIGHWAYS AROUND THE STATE. AS THE HOMELESS PEOPLE MOVE ACROSS THE ROAD WALL THEIR BELONGINGS ARE THROWN AWAY OR OR CLEANED UP AND THEN THEY JUST MOVE RIGHT BACK INTO A CLEAN UP PLACE THEY DO IT AGAIN. IF WE CAN FIND HOMES FOR THOSE PEOPLE OR MEDICAL HELP FOR THOSE PEOPLE OR IN SOME CASES JAILS FOR THOSE PEOPLE- WE COULD SAVE MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THAT COULD BE PUT TOWARDS FISH PASSAGE IN I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY A DROP IN THE BUCKET BUT EVERY DROP HELP SO I JUST WANT TO THROW THAT OUT THERE TO. KNOW I APPRECIATE THEM IS JAMES IN A KNOW THAT- I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR ME BUT I MISTER DAVIS BEEN ON. THE FRONT LINES OF. LITIGATION ON WITH. DISTRICT FOR- THE BAY AREA CALTRANS DISTRICT ON ALL ISSUES OF. LITTER AND TRASH AND THAT- CALTRANS IS WORKING ON A VERY AGGRESSIVE PLAN ON THAT ISSUE RIGHT NOW- IN- YOU'RE GONNA SEE MORE TO COME. IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS. I THINK WHERE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO ON ALL ISSUES OF FISH PASSAGES. TAKEN VERY PROACTIVE APPROACH ON THIS. NOT SENATE- CALTRANS IS NOT BY. WHAT YOU JUST POINTED OUT. ON IN ESPECIALLY WITH THE CRISIS THAT WE'VE HAD- WITH ALMOST RESIDENTS AND- LIVING ALONG OUR HIGHWAY SYSTEM IT'S A LAST RESORT. AND IT'S ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE CHALLENGES THAT CALTRANS. I IS DEALING WITH SO MORE TO COME ONTHAT I PROMISE YOU. MISTER DAVIS HAS BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS ONE- AND WORKING THIS- VERY. SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IT'S A VERY MUCH OUT YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH CITY COUNCIL OAKLAND. AND BERKELEY AND TONIGHT I'M GOING TO GO TO A LAKE MERRITT INSTITUTE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING. THEIR TASK OF CLEANING UP WEEK MERIT SO I'M- NOT TRYING. AT ALL ANGLES BUT I'M GET THOSE SPREAD A LITTLE SEND SO. YOU'RE YOU'RE REALLY GOOD SO THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU.
