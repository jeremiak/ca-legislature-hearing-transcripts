REGARDS TO THE M. MISUMI THAT AT

SOME POINT IT BECOMES.

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:57.382 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT EASIER IF THERE'S

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:59.317 region:rollup2
AN APP THAT'S CREATED WHERE YOU

00:41:57.382 --> 00:42:01.052 region:rollup2
CAN JUST TARGET WHERE YOU'RE

00:41:59.317 --> 00:42:03.021 region:rollup2
LOCATED IS THAT. IT YEAH I ALSO

00:42:01.052 --> 00:42:04.288 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT WE HAVE SOME

00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:05.089 region:rollup2
LIMITATIONS IN RIGA CARDS TO

00:42:04.288 --> 00:42:09.227 region:rollup2
BROADBAND.

00:42:05.089 --> 00:42:11.229 region:rollup2
A IT IS THEIR WORK HAPPENING TO

00:42:09.227 --> 00:42:13.331 region:rollup2
TRY TO MAKE IT EASIER. I GUESS

00:42:11.229 --> 00:42:13.931 region:rollup2
IN MY MY PITCHES I ALWAYS HATE

00:42:13.331 --> 00:42:15.233 region:rollup2
TO.

00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:16.501 region:rollup2
TO BE PUTTING A BURDEN ON AN

00:42:15.233 --> 00:42:19.170 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY THAT.

00:42:16.501 --> 00:42:21.072 region:rollup2
THAT IS A SMALL BUSINESS BUT

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:22.740 region:rollup2
ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS

00:42:21.072 --> 00:42:24.509 region:rollup2
REALLY TO PROTECT THAT INDUSTRY.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:27.445 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT IS KIND OF A

00:42:24.509 --> 00:42:28.312 region:rollup2
MARRIAGE BETWEEN. TELLING THEM

00:42:27.445 --> 00:42:29.614 region:rollup2

DO IT.

00:42:33.084 --> 00:42:36.320 region:rollup2
SO I THINK REGISTRATION

00:42:34.318 --> 00:42:37.555 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.790 region:rollup2

OVER TWO HUNDRED FARMERS

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:19.156 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO LAMB GUYS ONE GOAT

00:49:17.755 --> 00:49:21.058 region:rollup2

00:49:19.156 --> 00:49:23.928 region:rollup2
A ONE DUCK GUY WHO'S IN THE ROOM

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:25.729 region:rollup2
ONE EGG LADY SIX PICK GUYS TO

PEACH LADIES ONCE ROBBERY AYE

00:49:25.729 --> 00:49:28.466 region:rollup2
THREE APPLE PEOPLE AND THE LIST

00:49:27.064 --> 00:49:28.999 region:rollup2
GOES ON.

00:49:28.466 --> 00:49:31.402 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MORE AND MORE

00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:32.870 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS DEMANDING TO KNOW THE

00:49:31.402 --> 00:49:34.338 region:rollup2
FACE THAT FEEDS YOU PARTICULARLY

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:35.439 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA.

00:49:34.338 --> 00:49:37.141 region:rollup2
OVER THE YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:49:35.439 --> 00:49:39.677 region:rollup2
DOING THIS I CONSISTENTLY HAVE

00:49:37.141 --> 00:49:41.512 region:rollup2
SEEN THE LOSS OF SMALL FARMERS.

00:49:39.677 --> 00:49:43.180 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE IT'S TOO HARD TO MAKE

00:49:41.512 --> 00:49:44.648 region:rollup2
ENDS MEET.

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:45.216 region:rollup2
SOME OF OUR CURRENT POLICIES IN

00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:46.550 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY MAKE IT

00:49:45.216 --> 00:49:48.052 region:rollup2
HARDER.

00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:50.054 region:rollup2
WE'RE THE ONLY STATE IN THE

00:49:48.052 --> 00:49:51.655 region:rollup2
UNITED STATES BUT DOES NOT ALLOW

00:49:50.054 --> 00:49:54.124 region:rollup2
SMALL POULTRY PRODUCERS TO HIRE

00:49:51.655 --> 00:49:55.826 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES FOR THE HARVEST.

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:57.928 region:rollup2
HOW DOES A YOUNG FARMER LEARN

00:49:55.826 --> 00:49:58.495 region:rollup2
HOW TO DO THIS WITHOUT LEARNING

00:49:57.928 --> 00:49:59.697 region:rollup2
FROM SOMEBODY WHO'S ALREADY

00:49:58.495 --> 00:50:00.531 region:rollup2
DOING IT?

00:49:59.697 --> 00:50:02.132 region:rollup2
AND WHY DO WE HAVE THIS RULE

00:50:00.531 --> 00:50:04.435 region:rollup2
ANYWAY.

00:50:02.132 --> 00:50:05.803 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO USDA SLAUGHTER IS ALSO

00:50:04.435 --> 00:50:08.706 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES IN OUR

00:50:05.803 --> 00:50:10.541 region:rollup2
STATE THERE ONLY THREE USDA

00:50:08.706 --> 00:50:12.243 region:rollup2
POULTRY SLAUGHTER FACILITIES BUT

00:50:10.541 --> 00:50:14.111 region:rollup2
WILL PROCESS FOR SMALL FIRMS IN

00:50:12.243 --> 00:50:16.046 region:rollup2
OUR STATE. AND THIS IS A VERY

00:50:14.111 --> 00:50:18.015 region:rollup2
BIG STATES.

00:50:16.046 --> 00:50:20.084 region:rollup2
TRAVEL DISTANCES ARE GREAT AND

00:50:18.015 --> 00:50:22.353 region:rollup2
THE YEAR LONG WEIGHTLESS

00:50:20.084 --> 00:50:23.988 region:rollup2
FOR SLAUGHTER ARE TOO LONG.

00:50:22.353 --> 00:50:25.623 region:rollup2
THERE IS A USDA EXEMPTION FOR

00:50:23.988 --> 00:50:27.591 region:rollup2
SMALL POULTRY FARMERS THAT

00:50:25.623 --> 00:50:29.526 region:rollup2
ALLOWS THEM TO SLAUGHTER ON FARM

00:50:27.591 --> 00:50:31.762 region:rollup2
AND SETTLE TO HOTELS RESTAURANTS

00:50:29.526 --> 00:50:33.397 region:rollup2
AND INSTITUTIONS BUT CALIFORNIA

00:50:31.762 --> 00:50:35.933 region:rollup2
DOES NOT TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF

00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:38.102 region:rollup2
THIS EXEMPTION.

00:50:35.933 --> 00:50:39.470 region:rollup2
WHAT WHY WHEN WHERE THE GREATEST

00:50:38.102 --> 00:50:40.504 region:rollup2
AGRICULTURAL STATE AND THE

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:41.906 region:rollup2
CREATOR OF THE FARM TO TABLE

00:50:40.504 --> 00:50:43.674 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT?

00:50:41.906 --> 00:50:45.809 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY SMALL POULTRY FARMERS

00:50:43.674 --> 00:50:47.778 region:rollup2
CAN POSSIBLY SELL AT A FARMER'S

00:50:45.809 --> 00:50:49.914 region:rollup2
MARKET. IF THEY'RE INSPECTOR

00:50:47.778 --> 00:50:51.615 region:rollup2
INTERPRETS THE REGULATIONS THAT

00:50:49.914 --> 00:50:53.183 region:rollup2
WAY. AND IT'S DIFFERENT IN EVERY

00:50:51.615 --> 00:50:55.085 region:rollup2
COUNTY.

00:50:53.183 --> 00:50:56.720 region:rollup2
AB TWO NINE AND NINE ALLOWS FOR

00:50:55.085 --> 00:50:58.422 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES.

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.990 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE USE OF THE USDA

00:50:58.422 --> 00:51:01.525 region:rollup2
EXEMPTION FOR SMALL FARMERS TO

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:03.294 region:rollup2
SELL DIRECT TO HOTELS AND

00:51:01.525 --> 00:51:04.762 region:rollup2
RESTAURANTS.

00:51:03.294 --> 00:51:06.564 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT LESS SAFE.

00:51:04.762 --> 00:51:08.232 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU BUY DIRECT.

00:51:06.564 --> 00:51:10.634 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE SOURCE AND THERE'S

00:51:08.232 --> 00:51:12.570 region:rollup2
GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:51:10.634 --> 00:51:14.004 region:rollup2
REGARDING FOOD SAFETY AB TWO

00:51:12.570 --> 00:51:16.473 region:rollup2
NINE NINE NINE ALSO CREATES A

00:51:14.004 --> 00:51:18.075 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHERE POULTRY RANCHERS

00:51:16.473 --> 00:51:19.643 region:rollup2
WHO WANT TO SLAUGHTER ON FARM.

00:51:18.075 --> 00:51:21.312 region:rollup2
GET TRAINED TO BE THEIR OWN MEAT

00:51:19.643 --> 00:51:22.980 region:rollup2
INSPECTORS LIKE THE CURRENT

00:51:21.312 --> 00:51:24.815 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IN PLACE PER CDFA BUTCHER

00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:26.083 region:rollup2
SHOPS.

00:51:24.815 --> 00:51:28.552 region:rollup2
MY HUSBAND TAKES A CLASS EACH

00:51:26.083 --> 00:51:31.388 region:rollup2
YEAR TO BE ARMY INSPECTOR.

00:51:28.552 --> 00:51:33.557 region:rollup2
IT ALSO CLARIFIES WHAT IS

00:51:31.388 --> 00:51:35.159 region:rollup2
ALLOWED IN TERMS OF THE HR

00:51:33.557 --> 00:51:36.994 region:rollup2
EXEMPTION SO THERE'S NO

00:51:35.159 --> 00:51:38.595 region:rollup2
CONFUSION WITH THE

00:51:36.994 --> 00:51:39.930 region:rollup2
INTERPRETATION BY DIFFERENT

00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:41.732 region:rollup2

NOW.

00:51:41.732 --> 00:51:44.802 region:rollup2
AS THE MANY LETTERS OF SUPPORT

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:46.337 region:rollup2
MAKE CLEAR.

00:51:44.802 --> 00:51:47.504 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MANY SHOPS FROM ACROSS

00:51:46.337 --> 00:51:48.973 region:rollup2

I AM THERE SIMPLY NO BIOLOGICAL

01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:29.459 region:rollup2
REASON TO EXEMPT POULTRY FROM

01:05:28.191 --> 01:05:30.660 region:rollup2
THE REQUIREMENT THAT THEY BE

01:05:29.459 --> 01:05:32.395 region:rollup2
RENDERED UNCONSCIOUS PURCHASE

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:33.696 region:rollup2
SHACKLING.

01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:35.899 region:rollup2
HANGING A BIRD IN AN INVERTED

01:05:33.696 --> 01:05:39.002 region:rollup2
POSITION IS AND PHYSIOLOGICALLY

01:05:35.899 --> 01:05:40.637 region:rollup2
ABNORMAL POSTURE FOR. A BIRD AND

01:05:39.002 --> 01:05:41.838 region:rollup2
YOU CAN TAKE A BLOOD SAMPLE AND

01:05:40.637 --> 01:05:43.206 region:rollup2
MEASURE A RISE IN STRESS

01:05:41.838 --> 01:05:44.808 region:rollup2
HORMONES SO WE KNOW IT'S A

01:05:43.206 --> 01:05:46.009 region:rollup2
STRESSFUL PROCESS FOR THEM.

01:05:44.808 --> 01:05:47.844 region:rollup2
SHACKLES HAVE TO BE TIGHT

01:05:46.009 --> 01:05:49.546 region:rollup2
FITTING BUT THE LEGS

01:05:47.844 --> 01:05:50.980 region:rollup2
CHICKENS VERY AND SO HANGING

01:05:49.546 --> 01:05:52.982 region:rollup2
OPERATORS CAN USE CONSIDERABLE

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:55.218 region:rollup2
FORCE TO PERFECT LEGS INTO

01:05:52.982 --> 01:05:56.953 region:rollup2
NARROW SHACKLES.

01:05:55.218 --> 01:05:59.155 region:rollup2
BIRD STRUGGLE ON THE LINE THEY

01:05:56.953 --> 01:06:00.790 region:rollup2
HAVE NOCICEPTIVE PAIN RECEPTORS

01:05:59.155 --> 01:06:02.125 region:rollup2
IN THEIR LEGS AND FEET SO WE

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:04.127 region:rollup2
KNOW IT'S PAINFUL BRUISING IS

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:06.996 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTED.

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:09.098 region:rollup2
BROILER CHICKENS ARE PRONE TO

01:06:06.996 --> 01:06:11.100 region:rollup2
DEBILITATING LAMENESS AND LEG

01:06:09.098 --> 01:06:11.868 region:rollup2
DISORDERS AND SO WHEN YOU HANG

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:14.070 region:rollup2
THEM UPSIDE DOWN YOU ARE

01:06:11.868 --> 01:06:16.439 region:rollup2
EXACERBATING LIKE PROBLEMS THAT

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:18.007 region:rollup2
THEY ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCING.

01:06:16.439 --> 01:06:20.143 region:rollup2
SO GIVEN OTHER RESEARCH THERE'S

01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:22.378 region:rollup2
NO GOOD REASON TO EXEMPT POULTRY

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:24.314 region:rollup2
AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY NINE SIMPLY

01:06:22.378 --> 01:06:25.615 region:rollup2
MAKES THE ROLE MORE CONSISTENT.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:27.016 region:rollup2
BY EXTENDING THE SAME

01:06:25.615 --> 01:06:29.385 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY IN

01:06:27.016 --> 01:06:30.053 region:rollup2
PLACE FOR OTHER ANIMALS.

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:32.255 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SEVERAL GOOD

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:33.990 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES THAT CAN BE USED.

01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:35.925 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S HAD ONLY ELECTRICAL

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:37.827 region:rollup2
STANDING THERE'S CAPTIVE BOGAN

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:39.696 region:rollup2

CAPTIVE BOTH GUNS. AND GAS

01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:44.133 region:rollup2
STUNNING IS ALSO A POTENTIAL

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:45.201 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY. I AM IDEALLY YOU

01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:46.903 region:rollup2
WOULD WANT THE BIRDS TO BE

01:06:45.201 --> 01:06:48.605 region:rollup2
RENDERED UNCONSCIOUS BEFORE

TURNING THEM UPSIDE DOWN. BUT

01:06:48.605 --> 01:06:52.108 region:rollup2
THERE IS A METHOD WHERE YOU CAN

01:06:49.806 --> 01:06:54.010 region:rollup2
USE A CONE TO PUT THE BIRDS AND

01:06:52.108 --> 01:06:55.612 region:rollup2
YOU CAN STUN THEM QUICKLY AND

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:58.014 region:rollup2
EASILY WITH A CAPTIVE BOTH

01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:59.182 region:rollup2
STEINER. AND THEY'RE COMPLETELY

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:01.818 region:rollup2
UNCONSCIOUS BEFORE YOU EVER

01:06:59.182 --> 01:07:02.886 region:rollup2
POUNDS BUT THEIR THROAT. AND THE

01:07:01.818 --> 01:07:04.120 region:rollup2

AN ANIMAL WELFARE BENEFIT BUT

01:07:05.488 --> 01:07:08.424 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO A POTENTIAL BENEFIT

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:11.461 region:rollup2
THIS JOB.

01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:12.695 region:rollup2

THIS COMPRESSIBILITY COMPLETELY

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:26.489 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARY.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:28.124 region:rollup2
AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY NINE WILL

01:10:53.716 --> 01:10:55.451 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE

HANDED OUT RIGHT BEFORE OUR

TESTIMONY.

01:10:59.155 --> 01:11:01.824 region:rollup2
WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS FAIR

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:03.493 region:rollup2
THAT THE SMALL BUSINESSES OR OUR

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:05.928 region:rollup2

DEMONSTRATING A CLEAR NECESSITY.

01:11:17.173 --> 01:11:20.243 region:rollup2
THIS BILL ONLY MAKES IT MORE

01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:21.778 region:rollup2
FINANCIALLY DIFFICULT FOR

01:11:20.243 --> 01:11:23.079 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S MINORITY BUSINESS

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:24.714 region:rollup2
OWNERS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

01:11:23.079 --> 01:11:26.482 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE OCCURRENCE OF

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.496 region:rollup2
FOR THESE REASONS CALIFORNIA

HE'S

01:11:57.046 --> 01:11:59.882 region:rollup2
OR OUR BELIEF IS THAT THE

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:01.317 region:rollup2
PROMISE IS INCORRECT.

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:02.885 region:rollup2
THAT DECISION HUMANE TREATMENT

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:04.854 region:rollup2
OF BIRDS OF THIS ACCEPTED

01:12:02.885 --> 01:12:06.389 region:rollup2
PRACTICE IT HAS BEEN LOOKED AT

01:12:04.854 --> 01:12:08.858 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFICALLY.

01:12:06.389 --> 01:12:10.459 region:rollup2
AND IN OUR VIEW.

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:13.095 region:rollup2
IS THIS BILL PRESUPPOSES THAT

01:12:10.459 --> 01:12:14.897 region:rollup2
ONE.

01:12:13.095 --> 01:12:17.567 region:rollup2
OR MAKE ANY NUMBER OF OTHER

01:12:14.897 --> 01:12:19.368 region:rollup2
MEASURES.

01:12:17.567 --> 01:12:21.470 region:rollup2
OF STUNNING ARE MORE HUMANE.

01:12:19.368 --> 01:12:21.904 region:rollup2
THAT IS NOT BEEN.

01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:23.072 region:rollup2
WHAT HAS BEEN FOUND

01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:25.174 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFICALLY?

01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:25.875 region:rollup2
AND. WE'RE JUST UNCOMFORTABLE

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:26.976 region:rollup2
WITH PROMISE AND HAVE TO

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:32.782 region:rollup2
STRONGLY POSSIBLE.

01:12:26.976 --> 01:12:33.983 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:12:32.782 --> 01:12:34.917 region:rollup2

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:38.087 region:rollup2
I'M SPEAKING ANECDOTALLY.

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:40.690 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I I HAVE NO NO

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:42.458 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC. BEHIND ME BUT MY

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:44.126 region:rollup2
FAMILY'S BEEN SLAUGHTERING BIRD

HE A PLAN.

01:12:46.462 --> 01:12:50.099 region:rollup2
AND BEEN CHUCKLE THE ENTIRE TIME

01:12:48.264 --> 01:12:51.500 region:rollup2
AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT YOU'RE

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:53.402 region:rollup2
THE PERSON HANGING TO BIRDS

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.036 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE TRAINED WELL AND

01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:55.972 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE TREATING THE VIRTUE

01:12:54.036 --> 01:12:57.573 region:rollup2
MAINLY. BUT PAST THAT I DON'T

01:12:55.972 --> 01:12:59.942 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE SHOWING ANY

01:12:57.573 --> 01:13:01.978 region:rollup2
SIGNS OF. OF DISCOMFORT.

01:12:59.942 --> 01:13:03.880 region:rollup2
SO. THEY HAVE TO BE STANDING NOW

01:13:01.978 --> 01:13:05.248 region:rollup2
ANYHOW.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:06.515 region:rollup2
AND THE SHACKLING IS A VERY

01:13:05.248 --> 01:13:08.684 region:rollup2
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND AND

01:13:06.515 --> 01:13:11.020 region:rollup2
IT'S ACCEPTED.

01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:12.688 region:rollup2
PRACTICE IT'S NOT.

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:14.357 region:rollup2
THE BIRDS DON'T APPEAR TO BE.

01:13:12.688 --> 01:13:16.726 region:rollup2
GOING THROUGH ANY LARGE AMOUNTS

01:13:14.357 --> 01:13:18.594 region:rollup2
OF STRESS IN ORDER TO DO THAT.

01:13:16.726 --> 01:13:19.428 region:rollup2
THANK YOU THINK.

01:13:18.594 --> 01:13:22.565 region:rollup2
FOR ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE SPEAK

IN OPPOSITION.

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:31.674 region:rollup2
QUESTION FROM THE COMMITTEE.

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:32.108 region:rollup2

.

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:44.553 region:rollup2
I WOULD THINK THE INDUSTRY WOULD

01:13:42.285 --> 01:13:46.155 region:rollup2
MIND GOING TO A MORE HUMANE.

01:13:44.553 --> 01:13:47.857 region:rollup2
.

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:50.760 region:rollup2
WAY OF DOING THIS.

AND.

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:07.343 region:rollup2
THE SOMETIMES WE DON'T ALWAYS

01:14:06.108 --> 01:14:09.045 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF

01:14:07.343 --> 01:14:10.880 region:rollup2
IT. ON ENCOURAGE.

01:14:09.045 --> 01:14:11.681 region:rollup2
THAT THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO

OUT OF BUSINESS

01:14:18.521 --> 01:14:21.390 region:rollup2
THAT THIS INDUSTRY DOESN'T

BECOME FINANCIALLY.

01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:26.329 region:rollup2

STATE.

01:15:12.041 --> 01:15:17.446 region:rollup2
AND I'VE VISITED.

MANY FARMS WHERE CHICKENS ARE

01:15:17.446 --> 01:15:20.883 region:rollup2
GROWN I'VE BEEN THROUGH THE

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:22.585 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF OBSCENE.

01:15:20.883 --> 01:15:24.487 region:rollup2
AND IN THEIR SEVEN DIFFERENT

01:15:22.585 --> 01:15:26.055 region:rollup2
METHODS THAT ARE AUTHORIZED AND

01:15:24.487 --> 01:15:27.089 region:rollup2
I'VE PRETTY MUCH SEEN THEM ALL

01:15:26.055 --> 01:15:28.324 region:rollup2
NOT TO MENTION I'M A COUNTRY BOY

01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:29.325 region:rollup2
AND I'VE DONE IT THE OLD

01:15:28.324 --> 01:15:32.395 region:rollup2
FASHIONED WAY.

01:15:29.325 --> 01:15:34.964 region:rollup2

THE ELECTRICAL PATH MATH THE.

01:15:39.769 --> 01:15:43.439 region:rollup2
IT IS KIND OF A STEP BACKWARDS I

01:15:41.437 --> 01:15:44.907 region:rollup2
MEAN AND IT'S A PROCESS THAT

01:15:43.439 --> 01:15:46.409 region:rollup2
WORKS IT CLEANS THE BIRD IT

01:15:44.907 --> 01:15:48.444 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TAKES DOWN THE DOWNTURN

01:15:46.409 --> 01:15:50.012 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING ELSE IT IT.

01:15:48.444 --> 01:15:51.213 region:rollup2
IT THE WE WENT THAT DIRECTION

01:15:50.012 --> 01:15:52.948 region:rollup2
FOR A REASON.

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:53.949 region:rollup2
.

01:15:52.948 --> 01:15:56.485 region:rollup2
BEAT BECAUSE IT IS A CLEANER

01:15:53.949 --> 01:16:00.456 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

01:15:56.485 --> 01:16:02.091 region:rollup2
A I JUST.

01:16:00.456 --> 01:16:03.692 region:rollup2
TO ME THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IT

01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:05.761 region:rollup2
DOESN'T ADD UP THERE'S ALREADY

I DO KNOW THIS.

01:19:04.907 --> 01:19:08.377 region:rollup2
THAT A MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS.

01:19:06.675 --> 01:19:09.845 region:rollup2

CLOSE.

01:21:52.975 --> 01:21:54.777 region:rollup2
UNLESS SOMEONE HAS ANOTHER

01:21:53.542 --> 01:21:56.011 region:rollup2
QUESTION FROM.

01:21:54.777 --> 01:21:57.880 region:rollup2
I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE

01:21:56.011 --> 01:21:59.448 region:rollup2
THINK YOU THINK YOU.

01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:02.084 region:rollup2
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE SAYS ANY

01:21:59.448 --> 01:22:03.385 region:rollup2
OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS.

01:22:02.084 --> 01:22:05.087 region:rollup2
SO MR THURMAN WE HAD A LONG

01:22:03.385 --> 01:22:09.425 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS AND.

01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:10.058 region:rollup2
AYE AYE THAT IN IN REALITY WHAT

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:10.959 region:rollup2
I HEAR THE INDUSTRY SAYING IS

01:22:10.058 --> 01:22:13.595 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:22:10.959 --> 01:22:15.898 region:rollup2
IS THAT THIS MAY NOT BE THE

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:17.666 region:rollup2
MOST HUMANE. AND THEY'RE NOT

01:22:15.898 --> 01:22:19.668 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE SCIENCE. THE

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:22.738 region:rollup2
SCIENCE IS BEHIND THAT. BUT.

01:22:19.668 --> 01:22:25.107 region:rollup2
BUT MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS.

01:22:22.738 --> 01:22:26.675 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY I I DO WANT TO BE THE

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:27.643 region:rollup2
MOST HUMANE AND I'M HOPING THAT

01:22:26.675 --> 01:22:28.010 region:rollup2
IT IS.

01:22:27.643 --> 01:22:30.245 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:22:28.010 --> 01:22:32.347 region:rollup2
BUT MY ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH

01:22:30.245 --> 01:22:34.082 region:rollup2
SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE IMPACT

01:22:32.347 --> 01:22:36.385 region:rollup2
ON SMALL BUSINESSES.

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:37.252 region:rollup2
AND I THINK MR GRAY RAISES A

01:22:36.385 --> 01:22:40.589 region:rollup2
GOOD ISSUE WHICH IS.

01:22:37.252 --> 01:22:42.658 region:rollup2
MAKING IT A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM

01:22:40.589 --> 01:22:44.359 region:rollup2
WITH MONEY BEHIND IT IS IS

01:22:42.658 --> 01:22:45.627 region:rollup2
PROBABLY WAY TO BE ABLE TO. TO

01:22:44.359 --> 01:22:47.596 region:rollup2
REACH A COMPROMISE BUT IN ANY

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:50.165 region:rollup2
CASE WHAT I TOLD YOU IS THAT IF

01:22:47.596 --> 01:22:51.500 region:rollup2
YOU CAN COME UP WITH A FUNDING.

01:22:50.165 --> 01:22:53.035 region:rollup2
I.

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:55.270 region:rollup2
I THAT ADDRESSES ONE OF MY

01:22:53.035 --> 01:22:56.538 region:rollup2
BIGGEST ISSUES ON MOST OF THESE

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:57.940 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES ARE SMALL MINORITY

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:58.674 region:rollup2
BUSINESSES.

01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:00.075 region:rollup2
AND.

01:22:58.674 --> 01:23:01.276 region:rollup2
MOST OF THEM QUITE FRANKLY ARE

01:23:00.075 --> 01:23:03.278 region:rollup2
IN THE BIG CITIES AYE WHICH

01:23:01.276 --> 01:23:05.380 region:rollup2
SURPRISED ME. ON AND I THINK

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:06.715 region:rollup2
IT'S BECAUSE IN IN IN RURAL

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:07.783 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA PEOPLE TAKE CARE OF

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:08.851 region:rollup2
IT THEMSELVES THEY KNOW HOW TO

01:23:07.783 --> 01:23:10.686 region:rollup2
DO THIS KIND OF WORK BUT IN THE

01:23:08.851 --> 01:23:12.287 region:rollup2
CITIES THEY TAKE THEY GO TO

01:23:10.686 --> 01:23:14.489 region:rollup2
THESE BIGGER. FACILITIES.

01:23:12.287 --> 01:23:16.959 region:rollup2
OR THESE ARE URBAN FACILITIES.

01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:17.559 region:rollup2
SO I'M PREPARED TO SUPPORT OF

01:23:16.959 --> 01:23:20.195 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:23:17.559 --> 01:23:21.630 region:rollup2
IT IT'S NOT IN THE BILL BUT

01:23:20.195 --> 01:23:22.898 region:rollup2
YEAH WE HAD A CONVERSATION AND

01:23:21.630 --> 01:23:23.966 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:23:22.898 --> 01:23:24.900 region:rollup2
TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD.

01:23:23.966 --> 01:23:26.568 region:rollup2
IF IF YOU.

01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:28.503 region:rollup2
.

01:23:26.568 --> 01:23:29.972 region:rollup2
WELL AMEND YOUR BELT AND INCLUDE

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:31.840 region:rollup2
THAT IN IN APPROPRIATIONS WHICH

01:23:29.972 --> 01:23:34.443 region:rollup2
I THINK IS WHERE IT GOES NEXT.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:36.111 region:rollup2
I I THINK THAT WOULD IT LEAST

01:23:34.443 --> 01:23:36.879 region:rollup2
RELIEVE THE CONCERN THE BIGGEST

01:23:36.111 --> 01:23:38.881 region:rollup2
CONCERN I HAVE.

01:23:36.879 --> 01:23:42.017 region:rollup2
AND I I AM CONCERNED ABOUT

01:23:38.881 --> 01:23:43.285 region:rollup2
PUTTING.

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:45.888 region:rollup2
JUSTIN IN TERMS OF.

01:23:43.285 --> 01:23:47.523 region:rollup2
FOR FOR FURTHER REFERENCES THAT

01:23:45.888 --> 01:23:48.957 region:rollup2
MOM THERE'S A LOT OF A LOT OF

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:50.459 region:rollup2
THINGS PUT ON BUSINESS AND A LOT

01:23:48.957 --> 01:23:53.662 region:rollup2
OF TIMES IT'S SOMEONE OPINION ON

01:23:50.459 --> 01:23:55.163 region:rollup2
WHAT BUSINESS I TO DO. AND I I

01:23:53.662 --> 01:23:56.632 region:rollup2
REALLY LIKE TO LOOK AT THAT GOOD

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:58.066 region:rollup2
SCIENCE AND WE'RE DOING THIS

01:23:56.632 --> 01:23:59.434 region:rollup2
KIND OF WORK AND SO ON I'M I'M

01:23:58.066 --> 01:24:01.603 region:rollup2
HOPING THAT YOU'RE RIGHT THAT

01:23:59.434 --> 01:24:05.307 region:rollup2
THIS IS A MORE HUMANE WAY OF.

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:06.742 region:rollup2
TREATING ANIMALS ON AND. I THE

01:24:05.307 --> 01:24:07.943 region:rollup2
REASON I SAY I THINK I LIKE THE

01:24:06.742 --> 01:24:10.112 region:rollup2
IDEA OF IT BEING VOLUNTARY IS

01:24:07.943 --> 01:24:11.346 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF IF IN FACT THE

01:24:10.112 --> 01:24:12.881 region:rollup2
PRODUCERS.

01:24:11.346 --> 01:24:15.651 region:rollup2
FEEL LIKE IT'S MORE.

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:16.952 region:rollup2
IT'S MORE HUMANE AND THAT THEY

01:24:15.651 --> 01:24:19.254 region:rollup2
CAN BE FUNDED.

01:24:16.952 --> 01:24:21.123 region:rollup2
AS PART OF THE DISH THAT CHANGE

01:24:19.254 --> 01:24:22.391 region:rollup2
THEN THEY'LL DO IT AND DUMB AND

01:24:21.123 --> 01:24:24.459 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE A REAL GOOD TEST

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:26.595 region:rollup2
OF WHETHER I THINK WHETHER.

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:28.297 region:rollup2
THAT KIND OF MOVE IS IS A GOOD

01:24:26.595 --> 01:24:30.766 region:rollup2
THING FOR THE INDUSTRY SO MANY

01:24:28.297 --> 01:24:32.100 region:rollup2
CASE THAT I I HAVE NOT ISSUED A

01:24:30.766 --> 01:24:33.135 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION FOR THE COMMITTEE

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:34.770 region:rollup2
