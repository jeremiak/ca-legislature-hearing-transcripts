WE WELCOME THE ADMINISTRATION TO BEGIN YOUR PRESENTATION. GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS EXPLAINED TO BE HERE FOR YOU AT THIS AFTERNOON. THE ADMINISTRATION'S BEFORE TO ONE POINT ZERO SIX BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET FOR THE TRANSFER PROGRAM THREE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX MILLION OF WICH IS STATE GENERAL FUND. DECSS PRIORITIES CONTINUE TO BE ON THE EQUITABLE FUNDING ACCOUNTS FOR PROGRAM ACROSS ALL THE LOCAL TRANSFER AGENCIES THE COURTS AND STATE DECSS. WE WERE ON TRACK TO ACCOMPLISHING THIS FOR AN IMPENDING BUT LIKE MANY OTHERS CODE IS RESULTING IN THE SET BACK TO THOSE EFFORTS. THIS BUDGET SEEKS YOU TO TRANSFER PROGRAM BACK ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE THOSE OBJECTIVES. ALBEIT AT A SLOWER RATE. SO WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'D LIKE TO TURN OVER CONSTANT ENGINE OR TO. GIVE A. QUICK OVERVIEW THE DEPARTMENT'S PROPOSAL. GO AHEAD PLEASE. I THANK YOU MY NAME MENTIONED IN THE SERVER- THANK FOR TO GIVE A OVERVIEW ON THE BUDGET CRITICAL UNDERGARMENTS ARE YOU CAN GET DATA TO ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTAL PART OF THE CHALLENGE FOR PROGRAM WHICH IS JUST TRUST WATER AND ALONG. IMPACT THAT HAS THAT HAS ON. I SHOWN IN FIG ONE OF THE AGENDA THERE'S ABOUT EIGHTEEN FIVE DOLLARS ACHIEVING HELP ARREARS MOST OF WHICH IS SHOWN IN DELTA MORNING BRACKET. BETTER POINT YOU SHOULD. THE PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ADAM JOHN MY IT CAN. IS APPROPRIATE FOR PARENTS THAT HAVE UP IN OTHER WORDS IS THE LOVE OF SUPPORT FOR YOU INCOME. SET AT A LEVEL THAT IS. FOR PAYING. YOUR CHILD SUPPORT ORDERS ARE SET TOO HIGH. RELATIVE TO A PARA INCOME IN LEAD TO THE CAN OF CHILD OR- WHEN THE PAIN PARENT'S OWN. BASIC SERVICES TO CHALLENGE. WE HAVE A YEARS COMPROMISED BUT WE'RE STRONGER A COKE. SHOULD PROVIDED OPPORTUNITY FOR PARENTS REDUCE THEIR GOVERNMENT DEBT AND- WAY. YOUR GENDER BECAUSE ALL THAT IN. FOR CHANGES DIFFICULT PROGRAM BUT I WANT TO- GO HIGHER. ANOTHER ASPECT THE PROPOSED WHICH IS LOOK AT WHAT ACT. IMPACT TO COLLECT. OF GEARS. APPROXIMATELY ONE. OF THE GOVERNMENT I WOULD BE ARE. TO GLASCO FORTY DOLLARS DOLLARS IN. INCOME COLLECTIBILITY LOW AT THE TERM. AND HOW THE BILL TO READ THIS. OR HOW DID ACTUALLY BECOME. GARDEN WHICH YOU ARE IN THE ESCAPE. SUBJECTING THEM TO. ENFORCEMENT ACTION AS LIKE THE DETENTION. AND GOOD FOR ALL OF US TOGETHER DANTICAT AT. BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW AS WELL. ON THE MY COLLEGE POTECT PROPOSAL AND HAVE THAT YOU CAN QUESTION TO THE COMMITTEE. ALL THE- IF SO WE'LL GO TO THE PARTNER FINANCE. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I WOULD HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS ON. HELLO. RIGHT JACQUELINE BRACERO JACQUELINE BRAZIL WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE NO SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL WOULD ECHO STAFF COMMENTS OF ENSURING THAT THE STUDIES DO NOT DUPLICATE EXISTING RESEARCH BUT RATHER PROVIDE NEW INFORMATION- TO MOVE THESE CONVERSATIONS FORWARD- WE WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUEST A DRAFTOF THE RESEARCH PROPOSAL TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHETHER THE LINE OF QUESTIONING OR HOW THE TOPICS ARE FRAMED- ALIGNED WITH THOSE OF LEGISLATIVE. INTEREST BUT TAKING A STEP BACK AND LOOKING AT THE PROPOSAL MORE BROADLY WE WOULD ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE VIEW THE ADMINISTRATION'S RESEARCH PROPOSAL AS A OPPORTUNITY OR OF POTENTIAL VEHICLE TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS. OF EXISTING OR NEW PROGRAM POLICIES THAT HAVE COME UP IN PASSED BUDGET HEARINGS AND LEGISLATIVELY DRIVEN WORK GROUPS THAT COULD BOTH FURTHER INFORMED THE STATE APPROACH IN IMPLEMENTING AND MAKING CHANGES- TO ALIGN WITH THE FEDERAL FINALRULE. OR TO JUST DISCUSS POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PROGRAM AS A WHOLE I'M AND AN EXAMPLE WAS PROVIDED TO IT- IN YOUR GENDER IN THAT- THERE HAVE BEEN PAST CONSIDERATIONS BY THE LEGISLATURE I'M TO SEASON FORCE MEN ON CHILD SUPPORT DEBT OWED TO THE STATE THAT IS DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE. AND THUS IS NOT AN EFFECTIVE OR PRODUCTIVE USE OF PROGRAM RESOURCES IF THE LEGISLATURE STILL INTERESTED IN PURSUING THAT SPECIFIC- OPERATIONAL CHANGE AND ITS ATTEMPTS TO MANAGE AND REDUCE CHILD SUPPORT DEBT. I'M BECOME CONSIDER INCLUDING THAT- AN ASSESSMENT ABOUT PARTICULAR CHANGE WITHIN THE RESEARCH PROPOSAL WITH THAT SAID WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE ADMINISTRATION'S FOR ALL AND WILL SHARE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS WE HAVE WITH THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IF I CAN ASK BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT. IN THIS I'M NEW TO THIS SO VERY BRIEFLY CAN YOU SPELL. EXPLAINED TO ME THE K. FACTOR. ON THE LINE IS KRISTIN DONNELLY CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR THAT CAN GO INTO THAT DETAIL OF THE MORE CLEARLY. SURE JOHNSON IS BASS ON A MATHEMATICAL. AND THE KEY FACTOR IS A COMPONENT TO THE PERCENTAGE OF A PARENT'S INCOME THAT IS UTILIZED FOR CHILD SUPPORT. SO THE CURRENT K. FACTOR IS ZERO POINT TWO FIVE OR 25% AS A BASE OR AS AN ANCHOR AND SO THAT MEANS WITHIN CERTAIN BANDS OF INCOME FOR FAMILIES AND IT'S COMBINED HOUSEHOLD INCOME. WE ASSUME THAT FOR ONE CHILD WE'RE GOING TO ASSIGN 25% OF THE PARENTS INCOME TO SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN. OKAY THE LAST REPORT HAD RECOMMENDED FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE K. FACTOR AS IT HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED AND THE BANDS OF INCOME HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE IT WAS PUT INTO PLACE IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE. SO WILL WILL THAT BE PART OF THE STUDY THEN IS TAKING A LOOK AT THE KEY FACTOR IN SEEING IF IT'S STILL ACCURATE AND RELEVANT AND THEN HOW DOES THAT HOW WE- HOW WE USE THOSE TWO DATA POINTS. THE C. O. A. P. THE KEY FACTOR- TO REACH A CONCLUSION JOURNAL WE HAVE ANY OTHER DATA POINTS OR ANY OTHER. METHODOLOGY THAT WILL BE IN AND INTEGRATING INTO THAT. YES THERE COUPLE DIFFERENT RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES- ALREADY IN PLACE. THAT NEED TO BE UPDATED SO THAT TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT WHICH WAS PRODUCED- BY JUDICIAL COUNCIL CALIFORNIA AND- GIVEN TO THE LEGISLATURE IN JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN. DID RECOMMEND FURTHER RESEARCH ON THAT K. FACTOR- WE DO WANT TO TAKE A LOOK MORE BROADLY. AND GENERALLY THE IDEA IS THAT IF WE HAVE AN ORDER THAT IS TOO HIGH AS NAN SAID THEN WE COULD LEAD TO ARREARS. SO THERE'S THAT TIPPING POINT FOR PARENTS OF WHERE IT BECOMES TOO MUCH AND NEITHER PARENT CAN SURVIVE. SO IT IS ALSO INTERCONNECTED IN TERMS OF DETERMINING THE SUBSISTENCE LEVEL FOR THE PARENT WHO'S PAYING SUPPORT AS WELL. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS IN THE PROCESS OF KICKING OFF THEIR QUADRENNIAL REVIEWS EVERY FOUR YEARS REQUIRED TO DO A REVIEW. SO THEY WILL GET AGAIN BE LOOKING AT AND THE RESEARCH THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE AND WHETHER ANYTHING NEW HAS TAKEN PLACE SINCE THAT LAST REVIEW AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SO WHAT WE'RE PREPARING FOR IS THE BELIEF THAT THEY WERE ASKED TO DO FURTHER RESEARCH ON THIS AND SO WE CAN PARTNER WITH THEM TO DO THAT TOGETHER. SO WILL THERE BE ANY WHAT WHEN THEY JUST COME OUT WITH THEIR THEIR PATERNAL REVIEW. HOW HOW. WOULD YOU PROPOSE AND THAT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE SO WE'RE NOT REDUNDANT AND- DOING THE WORK DISCARDED INTO BY ANOTHER AGENCY. ABSOLUTELY THAT'S A HUGE GOAL FOR US WE DON'T WANT TO BE WERE DONE IN THIS RESEARCH SO. THAT QUADRENNIAL REVIEW AND THE SCOPE OF THAT IS NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO DO ANY ORIGINAL RESEARCH WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO HERE TO GET A BETTER IDEA FOR CALIFORNIA. THE REPORT FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA SO UNIQUE. AND THAT IT IS THE DIFFERENCE- IN ALL THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE WHERE HUGE STATE AND- IT'S VERY VERY DIFFERENT SO IT'S VERY DIVERSE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE APPROPRIATE RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND- F WE DO NEED TO HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE MORE CUSTOMIZABLE. AND IF WE CAN DO THAT. MAKE IT UP THAT WOULD NOT BE REDUNDANT THE ACCORD JOINING REVIEW WOULD SAY HERE'S THE RESEARCH. THAT'S IN TOTAL AND WE RECOMMEND YOU DO FOR RESEARCH ON THIS IS. SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON. THE FURTHER RESEARCH NEEDED TO GONNA TAKE DIRECTION FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL REPORT WELL SO THAT REPORT IS DUE TO JUDICIAL COUNCIL IN NOVEMBER OF THIS YEAR AND IT WILL COME TO GO TO THE LEGISLATURE IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO WE WOULD ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO START OUR RESEARCH AFTER WE KNOW FINALLY WHAT THEIR REVIEW THAT COMES STEVEN JERRY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT THEY RECOMMEND THAT WE RESEARCH FURTHER IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THEY DID RECOMMEND FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE KEY FACTOR AND THAT'S NOT BEEN DONE YET SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT THAT WILL BE IN THIS NEW REPORT AS WELL SO WE'RE NOT ANTICIPATING EVEN GETTING GOING ON THIS UNTIL NEXT YEAR IS THAT CORRECT. FOR THE K. FACTOR PORTION YES WE WOULD LIKE TO START WITH THE COLLECTABILITY PORTION HERE WE DID ANTICIPATE THAT THIS RESEARCH WOULD NEED TO BE DONE OVER TWO YEAR PERIODS THAT'S WHY DOES HAVE THAT TWO FISCAL YEARS IN THIS PROPOSAL OKAY. AND THEN- LET'S FIND OUT WHAT THE BEST PLAN. I YOU THINK IT'S A VERY- SO BASICALLY PAY SOMEONE A- JERRY SAYING THAT FOR THIS COMING FISCAL YEAR THE PROPOSAL IS REALLY TO STUDY TO COLLECTABILITY ISSUES AND THEN AFTER JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS DONE THEIR REPORT THEN YOU'RE GONNA LOOK AT THE K. FACTOR IS SO IS THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDES BOTH PARTS ARE IS IT JUST FOR THE FIRST PART. OF YOUR STUDY. IT'S FOR BOTH PARTS IN URBAN OKAY SO BOTH PARTS OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN WHAT IS YOUR LOOKING AT THE COLLECTABILITY ISSUES SO FOR EXAMPLE- YEAH WE DID HAVE A BILL WHICH UNFORTUNATELY GOVERNOR VETOED. REGARDING INTERESTS I THINK BUT I REMEMBER WHEN THE BILL CAME THROUGH HUMAN SERVICES ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IS THAT SOMETIMES- PEOPLE. IF ONCE THE PUBLISHERS LIKE WHEN THE DATE GETS VERY LARGE IN A LARGE PORTION OF THAT DEBT ACTUALLY IS NOT TO PAY THE FOR THE CHILD SUPPORT IT'S TO PAY THE PENALTIES AND INTEREST AND SO FORTH. THAT PEOPLE MUCH MORE RELUCTANT TO PAY IT BECAUSE I DON'T SEE THAT MONEY ACTUALLY GOING TO THEIR CHILD. IS THAT ISSUE GOING TO BE EXAMINED IN YOUR COLLECTIBILITY REPORT TO THE ISSUE ABOUT- PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS TO ACTUALLY PAY WHAT'S IN ARREARS. GIVEN WHAT THEY MAY KNOW ABOUT THE PORTION OF THE FUNDS IT ACTUALLY ENDS UP WITH THE CHILD- THAT THEY'RE PROVIDING CHILD SUPPORT FOR. YOUR QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE OF THE- COMPROMISE ARREARS PROGRAM IS A PROGRAM THAT WE ARE REVAMPING TO EXPAND OUT AND THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD- BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT OPPORTUNITY. THE LIMITATIONS OF THE CO PROGRAMS THOUGH ARE THAT A PERSON HAS TO PUT FORWARD A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY TO GET AND A LARGER AMOUNT RE REMOVED FROM DEBT. TO BUILDINGS ARE HE REALLY WANTS TO GO ONE STEP FURTHER AND LOOK AT CASES WHERE. THERE IS NO ABILITY TO PAY AND HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THOSE WITHIN SOFTWARE PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW ONLY CAPACITY TO ADDRESS THOSE IS TO CLOSE THE CASE ENTIRELY AND THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING WE'RE ABLE TO DO WITHIN OUR CURRENT FRAMEWORK OF RULES. THEM RIGHT NOW SO I THINK THIS WILL INFORM SOME OF THE DECISIONSTHAT NEED TO BE MADE ON THE ROAD ON HOW WE GET RID OF. AND ACTIVISTS TRULY UNCOLLECTIBLE IN ITS ENTIRETY OKAY SO I GUESS I WOULD URGE THAT WE EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF. THIS STUDY- THAT YOU'RE DOING- INSTEAD OF JUST NAY MORE NOW. LOOKING AT JUST PEOPLE WHO. CAN'T PAY THEIR DAD. TO ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE LARGER ISSUE OF- HOW DO WE MAXIMIZE OUR COLLECTION. RATE WHICH IS. TECHNICALLY WHAT THE WHOLE STATE WAS ABOUT INCLUDING YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE K. FACTOR BUT REALLY LOOKING AT SOME OF THE ISSUES. GUARDING- YOUR ABILITY TO COLLECT FROM P. I MEAN CERTAINLY WE WANT TO LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WHO QUOTE YOU KNOW CAN'T PAY IT AT ALL RIGHT NOW BUT ALSO WANT TO LOOK MORE BROADLY AT HOW HOW DO WE- YOU KNOW HOW DIFFERENT ARE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS WE HAVE THAT WE PUT IN PLACE LIKE WHETHER IT'S INTEREST OR PENALTIES AND SO FORTH MAY ACTUALLY IMPACT PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS. TO PAY BACK THEIR DEBT I THINK IT'S A CRITICAL QUESTION BECAUSE ULTIMATELY. WHAT WE WANNA DO IS WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT. CAN GO TO THE CHILD AND THEIR FAMILY I MEAN THAT'S HOPEFULLY THAT'S THE GOAL OF CHILD SUPPORT GREAT AND- WE SHOULD REALLY BE LOOKING AT THAT ISSUE AS WELL AND FIGURE OUT WHAT KIND OF POLICIES THAT WE PUT IN PLACE THAT MAXIMIZES THE FUNDS THEY'RE GOING TO. CHILDREN AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT BY DOING THAT WE HAVE TO REDUCE OTHER STATE EXPENSES AS WELL RIGHT SO WE KNOW IF YOU'RE THE KIND OF WORKS AND KNOW THAT IT'S ADDRESS SO- SO I GUESS I WOULD URGE THAT THE SCOPE OF YOUR STUDY BE BIT BROADER THAN SIMPLY JUST LOOKING AT THE- POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO. BACK AT THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE UNABLE TO PAY AT ALL AND LOOK MORE BROADLY AT SERVE COLLECTION PRACTICES. AND HOW THAT IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS AND HOW MUCH EFFORT WE HAVE TO TAKES TO TRY TO TEASE PEOPLE DOWN TO GET THEM TO PAY- IN THAT REGARD SO- I HOPE THAT. THAT WHEN YOU COME BACK TO US UP AND MADE WITH THIS PROPOSAL THAT YOU BE A BROADER. STUDY WOULD BE AND ANTICIPATED. A GOOD COMMENTS IN THAT IS THE- WE'RE TO GO AND THEY'RE ALL REALLY. INTO PLAY. IN CONNECT TO KATE FACTOR NOT DATING MAX IS REALLY TRYING GET ENACTED ORDER SO THAT READERS DON'T BUILD UP. THE COLLECTABILITY SAID HE'S REALLY LOOKING AT ALRIGHT WHAT'S ALREADY BUILT UP AND HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT NIGHT IT'S KIND OF ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CASES- WE HOPE TO ADDRESS IN THIS. THANK YOU AND THEN OF COURSE THE FINAL IMPACT ON CHILDREN FAMILIES- SO I GUESS I WOULD I WOULD ASK. SINCE THE IT WAS THE GOAL OF THE LEGISLATURE TO GET TO GET RID OF IT ALTOGETHER- AND IF YOU'RE JUST STARTING TO FIND. OUT HOW WE BEST- CAN. ON IT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S ENOUGH MONEY FOR. CATCHER AND FAMILIES. IF WE CAN PLEASE ASK YOU. TO COME BACK WITH THE FULL SCOPE OF THAT SO WE CAN PERHAPS PROVIDE SOME MORE INPUT ON WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE INCLUDED. BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE NOT QUITE SURE YET IF IT'S GOING TO BE A DATA COLLECTION TOOL OF PROCESS. EVALUATION AND LIKE TO SEE THE KIND OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE OF THE RESEARCH GOING FORWARD BEFORE WE- MOVE FORWARD. OKAY THERE'S NOTHING ELSE WE WILL MOVE ON. THERE'S NOTHING ELSE WE WANT TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT COURT AND FUNDING. THANK YOU HAVE MENTIONED GIVEN A- PROPOSAL HI NANCY MENTIONED THAT APARTMENT- AUGUST FIRST ALTHOUGH THE GENDER GIVE A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT- COURTS AND CHILD SUPPORT FUNDING PROPOSAL THE DEPARTMENT IS REQUESTING APPROACHING TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS FOUR POINT ONE YOUNG JOHNNY FOR THE DEPARTMENT CONTRACT THE GENERAL COUNCIL WHICH FUNDS LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT YOU MISTER MARKETS CARTER OUT.

AND FUNDING TO MANAGE DEPARTMENT IDEA OF THE STRUCTURE. HAS THE EIGHTY EIGHT YEAR PROGRAM A PROGRAM A COUPLE BY THE CAR EFFECTIVE FOR TO LEAGUE INCOME AND EDUCATE FAMILY LAW SOLICITORS AND GIVES CURRENT ACTIVE TO THEIR LOCAL COURTS TO LITIGATE TROPICAL CASES HOWEVER AGAIN AB PROGRAM LED TO AND BY STAFF THE COST. AT THE GYM THE POINTS OUT THAT BECAUSE OF THE OF THE AND ONLY ON BILL CRITICAL USED TO BE DOWN AND UNFORTUNATELY WE TO REDUCE OUR THE LOCAL CORPS INTRODUCTION TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR TO GET EDUCATE. AND LOOK UNDER BELIEVE ASPECTS OF A CHILD'S PROGRAM THROUGH THE. WE HAVE NO IMMEDIATE CONCERNS AT THIS TIME WE DO CURRENTLY HAVE QUESTIONS OUT TO JUDICIAL COUNCIL- INCLUDING HOW THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING MAY HELP LOCAL COURTS ADDRESS. COBIT NINETEEN IMPACTS ON CHILD SUPPORT COURT OPERATIONS AND SERVICES- WHEN WE HEAR BACK WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO REPORT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF ON ANY ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS- WE GAME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YEAH AND I GUESS THAT WOULD BE MY QUESTION TO IT IS SO IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE GONNA USE A LOT OF THIS BECAUSE WE'VE HAD TO GO TO A MORE VIRTUAL. TECHNOLOGY THAT BASED SERVICE- AND JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE THAT WERE ACTUALLY. THAT. WE'RE ACTUALLY ACHIEVING THAT AIM. THANK OKAY. I THINK THAT WE WRAP UP THEN I NUMBER TWO. MOVING ON TO. ISSUE NUMBER THREE. LOCAL TELL SUPPORT FUNDING. HI NANCY REQUIREMENTS- THE DEPARTMENT ACROSS TWENTY NINETY THE FUN THE TWENTY LOWER- LOS WANTED LOOK WHICH HOW SUPPORT AGENCY ON THE COUNTY GEORGIA I'D BE ON THE FUNDING METHODOLOGY WHICH WOULD TO. ON BACK COULD YOU AND I- ORTEGA'S TEACHER COUPLED WITH THE REDUCTION THAT THE COUNTY TOOK IN THE CURRENT YEAR AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA OKAY KATHY HAD DECREASED BY ALMOST ONE OF POSITIONS OVER THE LAST YEAR AND IT APPEARED TO DECLINE FURTHER IF YOU FUNDING IS NOT RISKY. INCREASE IN STOPPING IT HAPPENING AT A TIME WHEN PARENTS ARE MOST IN NEED ABOUT THREE FOUR TO THE DEPARTMENT CASELOAD ARE EITHER CURRENTLY OR ONLY A FAMILY THE FAMILY HAS BEEN DEEPLY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC- I DID YOUR JOB LOSS OR REDUCTION IN INCOME. THE CHANGES AND FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE MORE MODIFICATIONS TO CHILD SUPPORT ORDERS ARE OFTEN A LABOR INTENSIVE WORK WITH LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT STAFF. AND WORK WITH THE CURRENT DISPUTE THOSE MODIFICATIONS THE PROPOSAL IS A STEP TOWARDS DEPARTMENTS REQUIRE YOU TO ADDRESS FUNDING EQUITY ACROSS ALL LCT COUNTY BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL CLINICAL LOW. TWENTY COUNTY. HELP TO BRING ALL CAN CULTURE. COMPACTLY. HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS WHERE. OKAY WE HAVE DEPARTMENT ANYTHING. HELLO ADDITION COMES THANK YOU WHICH WOULD ANALYSTS. WE NO CONCERN WITH THE FUND GOVERNMENT- WHICH FIRST ALSO YOU MAY PAR RESTORED FUN. I'M THAT WERE ELIMINATED AS A PARTY THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ALSO WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH- THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH AND DIRECTING THE FINES I'M TO THOSE L. CSAS THAT PER ITS OWN CALCULATION DO NOT HAVE THIS NECESSARY STAFFING LEVEL TO FULLY MANAGE CASE WORK- WE WOULD KNOW. THAT WELL THE ADMINISTRATION'S RECENTLY DEVELOPED FUNDING METHODOLOGY FOR LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES INCLUDES MULTIPLE FUNDING AUGMENTATIONS IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT DUE TO PROJECTED BUDGET CONSTRAINTS THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PROPOSING. I'M ANY ADDITIONAL AUGMENTATIONS IN FUTURE YEARS- WHILE THE STATE MAY NOT BE THE BEST FISCAL POSITION TO COMMIT TO THOSE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AUGMENTATIONS. THE STATE MAY STILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS THEIR OPERATIONAL OR POLICY BASED CHANGES I'M SPECIFICALLY THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO EXPLORE- WHICH OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES ARE POLICY CHANGES. IT COULD PURSUE WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION'S FUNDING METHODOLOGIES ON BECAUSE I'M IT COULD DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO EVALUATE- POLICY CHANGES AND EFFICIENCIES THAT WERE RAISED AND PREVIOUS WORK GROUPS PILOTED IN SOME LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES- EVEN PREVIOUSLY CONSIDERED BY THE LEGISLATURE OR ADMINISTRATION. ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT BE- LEGISLATURE DIRECTED MINISTRATION- TO ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS- THAT WERE RAISED AND IT'S RECENTLY DEVELOPED A LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES BEFORE REPURPOSING THIS. BEFORE REPURPOSING. THE METHODOLOGY IN FUTURE YEARS. THANK YOU FOR MUCH I GUESS I JUST WOULD ECHO THAT AND ASK THE QUESTION THE DECISION A- FIRST OF ALL HAVE WE SEE. WHAT RESULTS HAVE WE SEEN FROM THE DECREASE THAT WE FACED WITH WITH COVERT. AND WHICH OF THE EFFICIENCIES AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OUR PRIOR STUDIES ON THIS ARE WE INTEGRATED INTO THE INTO THE QUESTIONS IN THE METHODOLOGY OF THE NEW STUDY. THIS IS A REGULAR WHAT SOME OF THE PRIMARY ISSUES THAT ARE MOVING FORWARD ON AND RETRIEVE ALL AROUND THE ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS PARTICULARLY. A SIGNATURE WITH COURTS AND THERE'S A BIG MOVE IN THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM AND FOR TELL WORKING AND THE REDUCTION OF. PRINCE THE ENTIRE STATE FOR A LITTLE TRANSFERASES AND STATE DECSS. AND WE ALSO HAVE SMALLER INITIATIVES THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THE TRAINING AND MAKE TRANSPORT MORE EFFICIENT- OUR MIGRATION TO THE CLOUD OF OUR TRANSFORM FORTUNE SYSTEM. AND WE EXPECT TO SEE SOME SAVINGS OFF OF THAT HOPEFULLY AND IN THE WAY THAT WE RENDON OPERATOR SYSTEM. AND BEYOND THAT THERE ARE SMALLER TWEAKS IN THERE ARE LOCAL BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE BEING. UTILIZED ACROSS THE STATE BUT THEY'RE NOT SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL CHANGES THAT THAT GREATLY IMPACTS THE OVERALL OPERATIONS ALSO PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM ITSELF IS GONE THROUGH ALMOST TWO DECADES OF LACK OF FUNDING AND EFFICIENCIES ALL ALONG THE WAY A LOT OF ISSUES. STATE FARM WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. THIRTY I THANK YOU THREE MUCH AND- I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION AND THE GOVERNOR'S AT LEAST PROPOSAL. TO END TO DO REALLY SOME INCREASE HOWEVER I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT. SEVERAL YEARS AGO PART HILLS WE CAME TOGETHER AND WE HAD CHILD SUPPORT DOWN COUNTY CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES AS WELL AS THE ADMINISTRATION COME TOGETHER AND DEVELOP- THE PROPOSAL THAT SAID FUNNY PROPOSAL WHICH IS SAID DON PIES AND BAKERY SHOOTER SOME INCREASE THIS YEAR. NOTE THAT AS WE WERE EXAMINING THAT- THAT. THAT THAT. WE ACTUALLY END UP BY FULLY INVESTING GENERATING MORE MONEY FOR CHILDREN THEIR FAMILIES THAN BY NOT AND SO I DO WANT TO KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WERE QUOTE-PUTTING A PIES BECAUSE THE ULTIMATE IMPACT AT LEAST FOUR WE LOOK AT IT SEVERAL YEARS AGO WAS IS THAT- OUR LACK OF INVESTMENT IN- CHAU IT INCIDENTS HAPPEN THEIR CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES IN A CHILD SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE ACTUALLY ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN ESSENTIALLY CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES GETTING LESS RESOURCES I MEAN THAT'S THE REASON WE HAVE CHILD SUPPORT IN FACT AT THE BULLS DON'T. TRY THINK HOW LONG W. EVEN AT SOME POINT WE WERE PENALIZED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY HAD PADLEY WE WERE DOING SO WELL I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT THERE IS SOME INCREASE THAT'S BEING PROPOSED AND I THINK PROPERLY TARGETED I GUESS I WOULD ALSO APPEAL SAY THAT- WE REALLY SHOULD BE TRYING TO WORK TOWARD FULLY FUNDING WHAT WE AGREED TO SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND IF WE CAN'T DO IT THIS YEAR- WE SHOULD AT LEAST IN THE OUT YEARS BE LOOKING AT ME THAT MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THIS IS ABOUT TRYING TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING WE CAN GET TO CHILDREN THEIR FAMILIES THROUGH THE CHILD. SUPPORT SYSTEM AND I'M AFRAID THAT BY PUTTING A PIES- IF WE CONTINUE TO STAY IN A PAUSE MODE WERE ACTUALLY GIVING UP ARE ACTUALLY GIVING UP WE ARE DECREASING WHAT WE WERE ANTICIPATING WE'RE ABLE TO DO SO- I GUESS I WOULD URGE THAT- VOICE ONLY APPRECIATE WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO TRY TO pCERTAINLY AT THE YEARS WE SHOULD BE PLANNING TO FULLY pPROPOSALS THAT WE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT ON SEVERAL YEARS AGO. NOT THAT MANY YEARS AGO AND- SO THAT WE CAN MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS WE'RE GETTING TO LAST TWO CHILDREN THEIR FAMILIES. FOR TO CHILD SUPPORT THANK YOU. LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR SEVEN TWO ALREADY BROUGHT UP. THE SIGNATURES HERE WE GO. I KRISTIN X. NINETY FOUR THE DEPARTMENT- THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE PERMITS US TO UTILIZE. OUR EXISTING RESOURCES IN TERMS OF AN ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE TOOL IT CREATES AN EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL RULES FOR USAGE OF THOSE ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES IN COURT FILINGS AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH A LONGSTANDING EXCEPTION ALREADY IN PLACE FOR A LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES. WITH REGARD TO DOCUMENT SIGNED BY THEIR AGENTS. THE GENERAL RULE IS THAT DOCUMENTS THAT ARE SIGNED ELECTRONICALLY CAN THEN BE FILED ELECTRONICALLY. THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE BUILDS UPON THAT AND BUILT UPON AN EXPANSION FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IN THE RULES OF COURT. THAT WAS EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY WHICH PERMITS ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE AND DOCUMENT SIGNED BY OPPOSING PARTIES AGAIN OF THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE ELECTRONICALLY FILED. HOWEVER ONLY ABOUT TWENTY COUNTY COURTS HAVE ELECTRONIC FILING CAPABILITY AT THIS TIME. AND EARLY TWENTY TWENTY WE SOUGHT TO UTILIZE OUR EXISTING ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE TOOL AND THAT NEW RULE OF COURT TO PERMIT THOSE LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES WITH ELECTRONIC FILE CAPACITY. TO CIRCULATE DOCUMENTS TO PARTIES TO JUST DISTILLATIONS. SO WE PROVIDE ACCESS TO THAT TOOL TO THOSE LTSA IS- WITH THE EXPANDED NEED FOR MODIFICATION DUE TO COPE WITH THOUGH WE WERE ABLE TO ADD A FEW MORE COUNTIES ON THAT- ACCEPTED OR ADOPTED EMERGENCY RULES OF COURT. TO PERMIT THIS KIND OF PAPER FILING OF THOSE DOCUMENTS SO THAT'S WHAT THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE DOES IT PERMITS US TO CIRCULATE THOSE DOCUMENTS SUCH AS STIPULATIONS- FOR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE AND THEN IF THEY COUNTY COURT DOES NOT HAVE ELECTRONIC FILE CAPABILITY. FOR THE LOCAL AGENCY TO BE ABLE TO PRINT THAT DOCUMENT AND HAVE IT FILED SO GREATLY REDUCES THE TIME IT TAKES TO CIRCULATE THESE DOCUMENTS. AND WE'RE GONNA BE HAPPENING SAID THAT SYSTEM UP. YES WE ALREADY HAVE THIS AVAILABLE FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES SO IT WOULD BE JUST PROVIDING ACCESS TO OUR ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE TOOL TO THE REST OF OUR COUNTIES EVENTUALLY WE WOULD UTILIZE OUR EXISTING STATEWIDE. OUR SYSTEM TO BE ABLE TO SEND THOSE DOCUMENTS THAT WE CAN SEND IT THROUGH THE SIGNATURE TOOL TODAY SO THAT'S WHY THERE'S NO COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE TODAY SO IT'S A MORE LOW TECH APPROACH- TO BE ABLE TO GET EVERYBODY ACCESS TO THIS AND HAVE THAT STATEWIDE CONSISTENCY SO. IN EVERYBODY IN ANY COUNTY SHOULD BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THIS TOOL RATHER THAN ONLY A SELECT FEW. I APPRECIATE THAT SPREADING IT OUT FOR EVERYONE TO BE ABLE TO BE THE BEST OKAY THE- DEPARTMENT FINANCE ANYTHING. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HORN- NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD THANK YOU. HELLO THIS TIME. THE CONCEPT OF EXPANDING THE ALLOWANCE OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE WAS IDENTIFIED AS A BEST PRACTICE IN OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY IN THE PREVIOUSLY LEGISLATIVELY DRIVEN WORK GROUPS- SO WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL BUT WHAT AGAIN REITERATE THAT- IN ADDITION TO THE EXPANSION OF THE SIGNATURE. IN THE END THERE IS STILL A QUESTION OF ARE THERE OTHER PROGRAM EFFICIENCIES THAT- WERE DISCUSSED IN THESE WORK GROUPS THAT COULD ALSO BE EXPLORED AND MAYBE JUST TO MAKE IT A FULL CIRCLE MOMENT- WE'RE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ARE THERE WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN LOOK AT COLLECTABILITY MORE BROADLY. I'M SPECIFICALLY IN THE LEGISLATION THAT WAS ULTIMATELY VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR THAT TRY TO LOOK AT THE PRODUCTIVENESS AND COST EFFICIENT EFFECTIVENESS OF PURSUING- CHILD SUPPORT ARREARS BACK- WERE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE. AND THAT WAS A- THE PROGRAM EFFICIENT THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN THESE WORK GROUPS- SO TO THE EAST AND I'M DEPENDING ON HOW YOU STRUCTURE IT COULD POSSIBLY ALSO RESULT IN SOME WORKLOAD RELIEF- AND COST PRESSURE RELIEF TO LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES IT BACK MEANS THAT- THEY'RE NOT. THEY'RE NO LONGER PURSUING- COLLECTIONS FOR THOSE CASES I'M SO AGAIN THAT'S JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE IN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE COULD- CONSIDER EXPLORING ADDITIONAL PROGRAM EFFICIENCIES BLANKING SIGNATURE THAT WERE MENTIONED AND DISCUSSED IN PREVIOUS WORK GROUPS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF ANY QUESTIONS ON THIS I THINK WE'RE GOOD TO GO AND I THINK YOU'RE ON TO READ THE PROPOSAL FOR INVESTMENT RELATING TO CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES- AND I SHOULD SAY THAT GENERALLY WE HAVE ADVOCATES PRESENT THEIR PROPOSALS. FOR INVESTMENT SINCE WE DON'T HAVE TIME. YEAH YEAH LET'S. PROPERTY I YES WE HAVE ISSUE NUMBER FIVE SUSPENSION OF PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES AND THEN YOU'LL BE UP AND OUT AND ALLOWS- THEM IT FOR THE FOR THIS ITEM AND GOING FORWARD IF THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND AND I WILL CALL ON YOU IF NOT I WILL NOT A THAT THE SAME FOR THE ILLEGAL. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ISSUE NUMBER FIVE TWO BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU- MANSION FOR THE DEPARTMENT- DISPOSAL IS TO COMPLETE CONTINUE THE SUSPENSION OF FAMILY CHURCH AND CHURCH I'M HERE SIX- POTENTIALLY THIS- STATUE THAT THEY- ARE GOING TO CENTER PROGRAMS.

AND OVER THE COUNTRY. APOLOGETICALLY. TIME THAT GINGER THANK YOU. OKAY IN ELSE THE BOARD ANYTHING FROM APART FINANCE I DO NOT SEE YOUR HAND UP ANYTHING FOR THE L. A. O. PLEASE- NOTHING THERE OKAY- ALL RIGHT THEN I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO THAT COMING BEFORE US THAT SOONER THAN LATER OKAY DR ANTHONY THANK GOODNESS ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW IF WE COULD HAVE THE L. A. O. PLEASE READ THE PROPOSAL FOR INVESTMENT RELATED TO CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES. YES WE WERE ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE TO READ THE EXTERNAL BUDGET PROPOSALS- WE WILL MAINLY BE READING THE TITLE IN THE BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPOSAL AS IT'S PRESENTED IN THE AGENDA. I WOULD NOTE THAT THESE ARE NOT ONLY A PROPOSALS AND MANY OF THE ISSUES ARE RELATIVELY NEW TO US OUR ABILITY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS MAY BE LIMITED. BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF TO GET ANY ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH PROCEEDS. OF SO AS IT RELATES TO THE CHILD SUPPORT PROGRAM THERE IS ONLY ONE EXTERNAL BUDGET PROPOSAL IN THE AGENDA. SPECIFICALLY THE CHILD SUPPORT DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION REQUEST NINETEEN POINT TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND ONGOING WHICH IS MATCHED WITH. THIRTY SEVEN POINT THREE MILLION FEDERAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND NOW WE MOVE ON TO. DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES OFFICE OF EQUITY PROGRAMS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE MY NAME'S ELIANA CAME ONCE I WILL BE PROVIDING THE RESPONSE TO ISSUE NUMBER ONE REGARDING THE OPEN NINETEEN RAPID RESPONSE EXPENDITURE- FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION FOR IMMIGRATION RAPID RESPONSE. FROM THE BROADER COPING NINETEEN BUDGET CHANGED SO IT IS INTENDED TO ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES STAFF FUNDING FOR A QUICK RESPONSE TO EMERGENCY SITUATIONS. WHERE IMMIGRANT POPULATIONS WERE IN ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERALLY FUNDED SERVICES OR BENEFITS CAN RECEIVE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE. STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR THIS RAPID RESPONSE PROGRAM WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IMPROPER INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTIONS. 1-300-040-0213 THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND NINE IT AUTHORIZES THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE TO NUMEROUS SITUATIONS INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS ABRUPT FEDERAL POLICY CHANGES AND PANDEMICS WHERE INDIVIDUALS MAY NEED SHELTER FOOD AND MEDICAL SCREENING CLOTHING OR OTHER BASIC SERVICES. LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT SET UP THE DISASTER RELIEF ASSISTANCE FOR IMMIGRANTS PROGRAM TO PROVIDE ONE TIME CASH ASSISTANCE TO UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS IMPACTED MAKEOVER NINETEEN WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR FEDERAL STIMULUS OR OTHER FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAMS. THIS PROGRAM DISTRIBUTED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN DIRECT ASSISTANCE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS TO PARTNERSHIPS. WITH OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS. IN ADDITION THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN CLOSED. WITH NONPROFIT YOU COUNTY PARTNERS IN SOUTHERN IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BORDER REGION MONITORING THEIR RIVALS OF IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ALLOWED TO ENTER. IN THE PAST RAPID RESPONSE PROGRAM FUNDING HAS BEEN USED TO HOUSE THE WRITING FAMILIES AND PROVIDE FOOD MEDICAL SCREENING AND TRANSPORTATION AS NEEDED TO INSURE SAFE AND WELCOMING AND TREAT PROCESSES NOT THE BORDER. RIGHT BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR RAPID RESPONSE FUNDING. BASED ON THE REALITY THAT WITH THE ONGOING PANDEMIC ANNUAL NATURAL DISASTERS IMPACTING YOUR RATE POPULATIONS INELIGIBLE FOR FEMA FINDING. AND THE SITUATION AT THE BORDER THE DEPARTMENT WILL NEED FUNDING AVAILABLE TO TO SITUATIONS IMPACTING OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. GIVEN THE POTENTIAL INCREASE IN IMMIGRANT FAMILIES ARRIVING AT CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN BORDER AND THE ON GOING. PANDEMIC THIS WILL ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT TO RESPOND IN A BOTH MANAGE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY WAY AND ENSURE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. WE HAVE APPRECIATED THE FLEXIBILITY PROVIDED BY THE CURRENT STATUTORY FRAMEWORK THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO SHIFT FOCUS AS THE FEDERAL IMMIGRATION POLICY HAS CHANGED. OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PREVENT. THE PROGRAM TO FOCUS ON TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD ARRIVALS PUBLIC CHARGE IS NEEDED TO RESPOND TO THE NEEDS ON THE GROUND. AS ALWAYS WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR FEDERAL IMMIGRATION POLICY CLOSELY TO ENSURE WE ARE RESPONSIVE TO ANY CHANGES. AT THIS TIME HOWEVER IT'S DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHAT TYPE TYPE OF ADDITIONAL SERVICES MAY BE NEEDED FOR THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THE SERVICES WOULD REQUIRE. THANK YOU AND I FORGOT TO INTRODUCE MYSELF MY NAME IS ELIANA CAME ONCE I AM THE IMMIGRANT INTEGRATION BRANCH CHIEF HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION ANYTHING FROM THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. I DON'T SEE YOUR HAND ANYTHING FROM THE L. A. U. OKAY IT YES. I'M OKAY I GUESS I GUESS I WOULD JUST A- ASK SAID THAT SO NONE OF THIS MONEY IS GOING TO BE USED FOR DIRECT PAYMENTS. TO PEOPLE THIS TIME IT'S JUST GOING TO BE USED FOR SUPPORT AND ALL THAT SUPPORT BE PROVIDED. THROUGH A GRANT PROCESS TO NONPROFITS OR HOW WILL WE DECIDE HOW. TO DISTRIBUTE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND TO WHOM. THANK YOU FOR THAT% QUESTION. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS TIME THAT THE FIVE MILLION IS- IS INTENDED TO RESPOND TO ANY SITUATION THAT ARISES SO IT MAY BE- AT SOME POINT YOU SHOULD AS A DIRECT PAYMENT MAY ALSO BE USED FOR OPERATIONAL EXPENSES OF OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS AS NEEDED- WEEK WE DON'T QUITE KNOW AT THIS TIME WHAT. EXACTLY AT THE EMERGENCY THAT WILL BE AWESOME IT WILL BE- SO WE DON'T HAVE THOSE SPECIFIC DETAILS BUT IN THE PAST IS MENTIONED IT HAS BEEN PROVIDED FOR AN EVER IDEA SERVICES INCLUDING SHELTERING. DIRECT ASSISTANCE OPERATIONAL EXPENSES TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE SERVICES. AND USUALLY WE HERE AT THE- INTEGRATION BRANCH WORK WITH- NONPROFIT SERVICE PROVIDERS AND PROVIDE GRANT LEGAL AGREEMENTS AND. AND GET THE FINDING OUT NOT MATTER. SO WE'RE NOT SURE YET IF THIS WILL BE THROUGH RAN FUNDING. WE'RE NOT SURE. WE'RE NOT SURE BUT THAT IS USUALLY THE METHOD THAT WE USE HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT TO ALLOCATE THE FUNDING TO OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS. OKAY SO THIS IS A QUESTION JUST IN CASE. AND DOES THE DEPARTMENT ANTICIPATE WITH THE NEW FEDERAL FUNDING THAT MIGHT BE COMING THAT THIS WILL ANYTHING WILL BE OFFSET. I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES AT THIS POINT WE ARE. STILL WAITING TO SEE WHAT TYPE OF FEDERAL PROGRAMS OR FUNDING WILL BE WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE- BUT WE HAVE IN THE PAST NO IN THE STATE HAS BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RESPONSES TO WAIT THAT IS THE INTENT OF THIS FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO PRINT. TO RESPOND QUICKLY. OKAY I THINK THE PART FULLY APPROVE THIS WOULD LIKE SOME MORE INFORMATION DR GRANT. THANK YOU- YOU MENTIONED THAT LAST YEAR OR TWO OR SEVENTY FIVE MILLION I REALIZED IT WAS A- PLOT THAT NOT JUST STATE MONEY WAS- OTHER TYPES OF MONIES- DO YOU ANTICIPATE FOR THIS COMING YEAR WE'RE GOING TO ALSO BE GETTING HELP FROM NOT FOR PROFITS AND OTHERS. IN THE SAME SCALE AND THEN I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS THAT WHAT IS TRUE REPORTING REQUIREMENT I REALIZE YOU CAN'T ANTICIPATE RIGHT NOW BUT ONCE YOU EXPAND THE FUNDS. IS A REPORTING REQUIREMENT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE IS HOW THE FUNDS WERE EXPENDED- ONCE IT'S- DONE ARE OR- SELF SERVICE BOTH OF THOSE QUESTIONS. QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION PRINT THAT WAS. PROVIDED LAST YEAR FOR THE DISASTER RELIEF ASSISTANCE FOR IMMIGRANTS FIND IMMIGRANTS PROGRAM WAS STATE FUNDING- AND WE DID PROVIDE A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE. LAST YEAR IN THE FALL- WITH. DETAILS ON HOW THOSE FUNDS WERE EXPENDED- THAT WAS A COMBINATION OF FUNDS TO PROVIDE OPERATIONAL SUPPORT THE NONPROFIT'S DELIVERING THE SERVICE. AS WELL AS THE DIRECTOR SYSTEMS PAYMENTS TO INDIVIDUALS- NOT SURE DR PANDA ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION BUT I HAD A FOLLOW UP. YES WELL ACTUALLY MY QUESTION WHAT IS THE SENATE OKAY SO. THIS IS SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR AND FIVE MILLION- AND I YEAH I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT FLEXIBILITY IS THERE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AS TO HOW YOU WENT THE FOR THE FIVE MILLION THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING THAT ONCE IT'S EXPENDED THAT. THE THAT WILL ALSO BE REPORTED TO THE LEGISLATURE. OTHERS FUNDS WERE EXPENDED. YEAH WE DO PROVIDE. WE DO EXPECT TO PROVIDE REPORTS BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND EXPENDITURE OF THOSE FUNDS. OKAY AND- ALL RIGHT THAT'S- DIDN'T DESERVE- OKAY. THAT'S RIGHT THANK YOU OKAY AND SINCE I'M I'M TO THE COMMITTEE HAVE HAVE WE USED ALL THE SEVENTY FIVE MILLION THAT WAS ALREADY THERE. IS THAT A QUESTION YES I'M SO YES THAT WAS A QUESTION FOR YOU. HI YES WE HAVE THOSE FUNDS WERE EXPENDED LAST YEAR. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT IF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE I THINK WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. I COULD AFTERNOON SENATORS MY NAME IS MARCELLA RUIZ AND I AM THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF EQUITY AND ISSUE NUMBER TWO IS RELATED. TO FOR A BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS BCPS FOR THE OFFICE OF EQUITY A PRISON ON THREE OF THEM. AND THEN- PASS IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AS BRANCH CHIEF AND I CAME AWAY IT'S FOR THE FOURTH WHICH IS RELATED TO THE IMMIGRATION WORK. SO OUR FIRST REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL IS FOR OUR LANGUAGE SERVICES UNIT WHICH- WE ARE SEEKING FOR POSITIONS ONE AS A SOMEONE AND THREE EIGHT GPAS. TO EXPAND OUR IN HOUSE CAPACITY FOR LANGUAGE ACCESS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS. AS YOU ARE AWARE CDSS PROGRAMS ARE SUBJECT MULTIPLE FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS THAT REQUIRE A DOCUMENT TRANSLATION SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT THE POPULATIONS WE SERVE HAVE ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION THAT WE PROVIDE. CURRENTLY OUR STAFFING IS SEVEN POSITIONS ONE S. ASSIGNMENT SIX EIGHT GPAS. AND WITH THAT WE WILL PROBABLY WERE ABLE TO PRODUCE- HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PRODUCE BETWEEN TEN THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN THOUSAND PAGES OF TRANSLATION PER YEAR ALL JUST NOTE THAT IS TWICE AS MANY AS WE TRANSLATED FIVE YEARS AGO. AS YOU ARE AWARE OUR DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN EXPANDING AND WITH PROGRAM EXPANSION AND REORGANIZATION SUCH AS THE TRANSITION OF THAT. CITY PROGRAMS WE WILL ALSO NEED TO EXPAND OUR RESOURCES TO ENSURE LANGUAGE ACCESS SO THE ADDITION OF THESE FOR REQUESTED. STAFF TRANSLATORS WILL ALLOW CDSS TO COVER MORE LANGUAGES IN HOUSE AND TO ADDRESS THE INCREASED VOLUME THAT THAT WE EXPECT AN INVITE ONLY TO ENSURE THE QUALITY CONTROL THAT IS OFTEN SUCH A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF LANGUAGE. AS THE NEXT PROPOSAL IS RELATED TO EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY- SIMILARLY TO THE LAST PROPOSAL I JUST SPOKE ABOUT GIVEN THE GROWTH IN THE DEPARTMENT WE ALSO SEE AN INCREASE NEED- TO STAFF UP IN R. E. O. OR EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY. OFFICE WHICH IS CURRENTLY STAFFED BY BY BY FIVE STAFF PEOPLE WHO ARE INVESTIGATING- ALMOST TWICE AS MANY COMPLAINTS AS WE SAW FIVE FIVE YEARS AGO- WE ARE SEEKING TO ADDITIONAL HEPA POSITIONS IN ORDER TO LOWER THE RATIOS OF THE NUMBER OF CASES PER STAFF PERSON. AND THEREBY ENSURE THAT CASES ARE RESOLVED IN A TIMELY IN A TIMELY MANNER ULTIMATELY WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT THE RIGHTS OF ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR AND THE IN THE POPULATION THAT WE SERVE. OUR ARE ARE PROTECTED AND THAT INVESTIGATIONS ARE TIMELY AND ALSO WE WANT TO REDUCE- COSTLY LITIGATION THAT CAN RESULT FROM THE LAYS IN THE PROCESS. THE THIRD PROPOSAL IS RELATED TO OUR OFFICE OF TRIBAL AFFAIRS- A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WE WERE AUTHORIZED TO FUNDS THREE HEPA POSITIONS THAT SERVE IN THE CAPACITY OF IF THEY EAT ECWA FIELD LIAISON- THOSE POSITIONS ARE GOING TO SUNSET AND SO WE ARE ASKING FOR IT TO MAKE THOSE THREE POSITIONS PER MINUTE. AT AS YOU KNOW THE INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT AND RECOGNITION THAT AMERICAN INDIAN CHILDREN. ARE WERE BEING REMOVED FROM THEIR HOMES. ADAM HIGHER RATE THAN NON NATIVE CHILDREN CALIFORNIA HAS RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF A QUAD HAS CODIFIED IN OUR OWN IN OUR OWN STATUTES IN THE MAIN- THE MAIN GOAL IS HERE TO ADD TO PREVENT THE BREAK UP OF THE INDIAN FAMILY AND TO PROVE OUTCOMES FOR AMERICAN INDIAN CHILDREN. THE THREE O'CLOCK POSITIONS ARE REALLY CRITICAL TO THAT TASK THEY COULDN'T ACT. COUNTIES AND TRIBES WITH RESOURCES THEY HELP BUILD THE CAPACITY OF OUR OF OUR COUNTIES ARE ENFORCING OUR CHILD WELFARE- THAT ARE MANAGING AND MEASURING OUR CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS- CONFORMITY AND COMPLIANCE WITH WHAT IMPLEMENTATION THE ENSURE THAT THERE IS THE RIGHT LEVEL OF INQUIRY AN ACTIVE EFFORTS MADE TO MAINTAIN AND TO UNITE INDIAN CHILDREN. IN THEIR HOMES OR WITH THEIR FAMILY AND- WITH WITHIN THEIR TIBES- WE REALLY SEE THIS IS A CRITICAL CRITICAL EQUITY ISSUE GIVEN THAT IN SOME COUNTIES THE CASELOADS OF AMERICAN. A NATIVE AMERICAN CHILDREN IN IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM MARK 40% OF THE ENTIRE HE SLID THIS COMPUTER TO A POPULATION SIZE OF JUST UNDER 2% FOR IT FOR THE ENTIRE STATE OF NATIVE. AMERICAN OR A MINUTE AMERICAN INDIAN POPULATIONS SO WE FEEL LIKE THESE POSITIONS WOULD BE CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT WE SEE BETTER OUTCOMES FOR AMERICAN INDIAN CHILDREN. AND WITH THAT I WILL HAND IT BACK OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE AND I KEEP A WHAT'S FOR THE FOURTH ITEM UNDER THE OFFICE. OF EQUITY BCPS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO B. C. THAT WE'RE REQUEST FOR. IMMIGRATION SERVICES RAPID RESPONSE UNIT IS TO ASSOCIATE GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAM ANALYST HEPA. TO MEET IMMIGRANT NEEDS GIVEN THE ONGOING EMERGENCY TRACE INSTANCES THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND THE BORDER SITUATION IN RECENT WILDFIRES. ARE CSS IMMIGRATION SERVICES CREATED THE RAPID RESPONSE UNIT IN FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT DISASTER ASSISTANCE- PRIMARILY FOR UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR FEDERALLY FUNDED SERVICES. CURRENTLY THIS UNIT HAS TO LIMITED TERM STOCK POSITIONS ONE MANAGER SPECIALIST AND ONE ANALYST. USED TO ADDITIONAL STAFF WOULD ALLOW THE RAPID RESPONSE UNIT TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DESIGN IMPLEMENT AND MONITOR SEVERAL RESPONSE INITIATIVES AT ONCE WITHOUT HAVING TO TEMPORARILY BORROW STAFF. FROM OUR OTHER IMMIGRATION PROGRAMS THEMSELVES CARRY A SIGNIFICANT WORKLOAD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYTHING FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I SEE NOTHING- L. A. O. S. C. YOUR HANDS UP. PLEASE GO AHEAD. WE'VE REVIEWED THE PROPOSALS- AND HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE DIFFERENT. PROPITIATE THE PROPOSAL SET UP PARTICULARLY AS CHAIR OF THE API LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS- LANGUAGE ACCESS TO HUGE BARRIER TO PEOPLE GETTING SERVICES AND- PREACH AND THE FACT THAT WE WERE FALLING BEHIND THIS WAS CONCERNING CELL FREESHEET THAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE INVESTMENT TO ENSURE PEOPLE ACTUALLY HAVE THE ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO BUDGET FOR. THIS COMING YEAR THROUGH- IMPROVE TRANSLATION THAT THAT THE FARM SOCIAL SERVICES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY- SO LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE FLEXIBILITY AN ALLOCATION OF REFUGEE SUPPORT SERVICE FUND. IF I MAY- I THINK THERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION IN ISSUE NUMBER TWO ABOUT. ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE THE COLLEGE ALL SHE- GO AHEAD. I JUST LIKE TO PROVIDE A BRIEF UPDATE ON THAT FINDING THAT THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN APPROPRIATE FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO CREATE THE FIRST STATE FUNDED IMMIGRATION LEGAL FELLOWSHIP THE IMMIGRATION LEGAL FELLOWSHIP AIMS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF REMOVAL DEFENSE ATTORNEYS IN THE CAPACITY OF NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE RELIABLE DEFENSE SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA'S CENTRAL COAST AND CENTRAL VALLEY REGION'S REMOVAL DEFENSE IS A HIGHLY SPECIALIZED AREA OF THE LAW THAT HAS BEEN CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMPLEX OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS. CALIFORNIA'S POOL OF EXPERIENCE FOR MOBILE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS IT IS SMALL COMPARED TO THE DEMAND FOR SERVICES AND WORLD REGIONS OFTEN HAVE NO AVAILABLE QUALIFIED ATTORNEYS LEAVING THESE POPULATIONS VULNERABLE TO FRAUD AND RECEIVING SUBPAR IMMIGRATIONLEGAL SERVICES- THE DEPARTMENT IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO IDENTIFY THE NEEDS BEST PRACTICES AND DESIGN THE TRAINING PROGRAM. AND SERVICE DELIVERY MARK. WHAT WE'RE FINDING TEN IN. THEFOLLOWS WERE BEING HOST AT SEVEN NONPROFIT FOR TWO YEARS TO RECEIVE INTENSIVE REMOVAL DEFENSE TRAINING AND MENTORING AS WELL AS- PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE SERVING WORLD. IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES- WE SELECTED ONE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION TO WRITE IMMIGRATION LEGAL TRAINING AND OVERSEE THE THREE OTHER PARTNERS WILL BE PROVIDING THE RECRUITMENT MENTORSHIP AND SUPPORTING THE CAPACITY OF THE HOST NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. WE EXPECT THIS INVESTMENT WILL INCREASE BOTH THE NUMBER OF EXPERIENCE FOR MOBILE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS PROVIDING SERVICES ON THE CENTRAL COAST AND CENTRAL VALLEY. AS WELL AS THE CAPACITY OF THE HOST ORGANIZATIONS TO ESTABLISH AN ONGOING REMOVAL DEFENSE PRACTICE WITHIN THEIR OWN ORGANIZATION. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH AND THEN WE PLANET HAS HAVE WE STARTED GET OR WE'RE JUST BEGINNING THAT CORRECT. YES BUT IT'S JUST JUST STARTING OUT WITH SELECT PROPOSAL EVEN PLACE WITH THEIR ORGANIZATIONS OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL RIGHT. ANYTHING ELSE ON THIS. ALL RIGHT THEN LET'S GO TO THE NEXT. ISSUE FLEXIBILITY AS A TWO YES LET ME AS WELL- THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TITLE FLEXIBILITY IN THE ALLOCATION OF REFUGEE SUPPORT SERVICES TO PROVIDE THE CITY SAYS THE FLEXIBILITY NEEDED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF FEDERALLY FUNDED REFUGEE POPULATIONS WHEN COUNTY SAN ARE UNABLE TO DO SO. THE SPECIFIC REQUEST SYSTEM AND WALDRON SITUATIONS CODE SECTION THIRTEEN TWO SEVEN SIX TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT WITH THE DISCRETION TO RE ALLOCATE DECLINED OR RETURNED FUNDING BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT ELIGIBLE POPULATIONS NOT JUST NOT JUST ARRIVAL DATA. IS BACKGROUND THE DEPARTMENT OVERSEAS CALIFORNIA'S REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM WHICH IS FUNDED BY THE FEDERAL OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT THROUGH OUR REFUGEE PROGRAMS BUREAU HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT THE BUREAU IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING AND COORDINATING THE DELIVERY OF BENEFITS AND SERVICES TO THE REFUGEE POPULATIONS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COUNTIES AND LOCAL REFUGEE SERVICE PROVIDERS. EVERY YEAR THE FEDERAL OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT ALLOCATES A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF REFUGEE SUPPORT SERVICES FUNDING TO CALIFORNIA BASED ON THE PROJECTED NUMBER OF REFUGEE CLAIMANTS ARRIVING TO THE STATE PAYMENTS TO THE STATES ARE MADE CORD PAVEMENTS TO THE STATE ARE MADE QUARTERLY LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA RECEIVED A BASE AMOUNT OF FIFTEEN MILLION SUPPORT SERVICES FUNDING AND ANOTHER TWO MILLION- FOR CERTAIN SET ASIDE PROGRAMS TARGETING STUDENTS ELDERLY AND YOUTH MENTORING. FOR A TOTAL OF. SEVENTEEN NINE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO. THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE BASE WHERE SUPPORT SERVICES FUNDING BE USED TO. A OF SUPPORTS. INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT AND WORKFORCE SKILL BUILDING ENGLISH LANGUAGE ACQUISITION AND CHILD CARE SUPPORT SIMILAR TO THE SUPPORT SERVICES OFFERED TO OUR STATE CAO WORKS PROGRAM. IN CALIFORNIA REFUGEE SUPPORT SERVICES ARE DELIVERED BY EIGHT COUNTIES WITH LARGE REFUGEE POPULATIONS THAT WE CALL IMPACTED COUNTIES WILL RECEIVE ALLOCATIONS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF REFUGEE ARRIVALS NOT SILENCE IN THEIR COUNTIES. UNDER CURRENT STATUTE ONLY REFUGEE IMPACTED COUNTIES ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE REFUGEE SUPPORT SERVICES. BASEDON THIS CRITERIA THE FOLLOWING EIGHT COUNTIES RECEIVED THE FUNDING ALAMEDA LOS ANGELES ORANGE SACRAMENTO SAN DIEGO SAN FRANCISCO SANTA CLARA AND STANISLAUS. 95% OF THE STATE'S REFUGEES RESETTLE IN ONE OF THOSE IMPACTED COUNTIES. ELIGIBLE COUNTIES ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO ACCEPT THE FINDINGS. CURRENTLY OUR WEEK SECTION THIRTEEN TO SEVEN SIX SPECIFIES HOW THAT FUNDING ALLOCATION IS MADE BASED ON THE POPULATION WITHOUT DISCRETION OR FLEXIBILITY AFFORDED FOR SITUATIONS WHERE THE COUNTY IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE TARGETED SERVICES FOR SPECIFIC POPULATION. WITHIN A GIVEN TIME FRAME. THIS WEEK SECTION REQUIRE CSS TO DISTRIBUTE ALL RECORD YOUR SUPPORT SERVICES FUNDING INCLUDING THE ANNUAL APPROPRIATION FROM O. R. R. AND ANY DECLINED OR RETURNED FUNDS PROPORTIONALLY TO ALL EIGHT REFUGEE IMPACTED COUNTIES. IF A COUNTY DECLINED TO RETURNS FINDING THE DEPARTMENT DOES NOT HAVE THE DISCRETION TO USES FUNDING FOR OTHER COUNTIES WITH HIGHER NEEDS. THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WOULD GIVE CSS THE AUTHORITY AND THE DISCRETION TO ALLOCATE DECLINED TO RETURN REFUGEE SUPPORT SERVICES FINDING. AND SUPPLEMENTAL OR TARGETED FUNDING FROM THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH A RESETTLEMENT TO OTHER SERVICE SERVICE AREAS AS NEEDED. THE REASON- OUR OUR REFUGEE SUPPORT SERVICES SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR KOBE NINETEEN RELATED SUPPORT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE NEED FOR THIS WORKS ABILITY- ARE PROVIDED CALIFORNIA SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATION OF ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT REFUGEES IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE FOR HOUSING OR OTHER BUT BASIC NEEDS DURING COVERT NINETEEN. DURING THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. PER THE STATUTE CALIFORNIA WAS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A PROPORTIONAL ALLOCATION THE STATE WAS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE PROVIDE A PROPORTIONAL ALLOCATION TO EACH OF THE IMPACTED COUNTY. WITHOUT REGARD TO THE COUNTY'S ABILITY TO STAND UP SERVICES QUICKLY OR THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF THE POPULATION. THIS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WOULD PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF FLEXIBILITY NEEDED TO USE RETURNED- ON USE FUNDS TO TARGET IMMEDIATE. NEEDS OF THE REFUGEE POPULATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE THING FROM THE PART OF FINANCE I DO NOT SEE YOUR HAND UP. ANYTHING FROM THE L. A. O. I SEE YOU SHAKING YOUR HEAD AND I WILL TAKE THAT AS A NOT HAND UP. CAN YOU CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE ABOUT WHY A COUNTY WOULD. WOULD DECLINE OR RETURN FUNDING. YES% SOME SOME COUNTIES JUST DON'T HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY IN THEIR CONTRACTS TO AND THAT REQUESTED SERVICE PROVIDERS CHANGE THOSE TO DELIVER TO IT TO CHANGE THE SCOPE OF SERVICES QUICKLY. SOMETIMES THEY DON'T HAVE A KIND OF THAT CONTRACT FLEXIBILITY AND OR THE SPECIALIZED SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THEIR AREA TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THE SPECIFIC POPULATION NEEDED. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU IF. OUR OUR WORD TO REQUEST TO TURN COUNTY PROVIDE SERVICES TO HAITIAN ARRIVALS AND THEY DON'T HAVE A SERVICE PROVIDER TO DO THAT THEY THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO STAND THAT UP QUICKLY ON THEIR OWN. OKAY IN BEEN. MY OWN EDUCATION IF SOMEBODY SO. SO I LIVE IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY SACRAMENTO COUNTY IS COVERED STANISLAUS COUNTY IS COVERED THAT'S RIGHT IN BETWEEN. THOSE TWO IF SOMEONE'S IN LOVE SOMEONE CAN COME NEEDS HELP. IS THERE ARE THERE. M. O. EIGHT M. O. USE IN PLACE WITH. OTHER COUNTIES TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES OR IS IT JUST PEOPLE WHO RESIDE IN THOSE COUNTIES ARE ELIGIBLE. THE FEDERAL ARE ARE FINDING ONLY FLOW THROUGH THOSE EIGHT IMPACTED COUNTIES HOWEVER THERE ARE MANY IMMIGRANT SERVING ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO THESE REFUGEES IT'S JUST NOT USING THE- ARE FEDERALLY FUNDED ALLOCATION. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTRINE. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE ACTUALLY THIS PRESS QUICK QUESTION FOR L. A. L. IS- I GET THE DESIRE FOR FLEXIBILITY- DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS IN TERMS OF. OVERSIGHT THAT WE SHOULD BE X. ASKING FOR- FOR AN EXCHANGE FOR THE FLEXIBILITY. HI THIS IS RYAN ANDERSON THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DON'T HAVE ANY INCOME. SPECIFIC CONCERNS OR COMMENTS WITH REGARDS TO THAT AT THIS TIME BUT WHEN CONTINUING. TO LOOK AT ALL THESE PROPOSAL SO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU. WE HAVE SPECIFIC CONCERNS NINE APPRECIATE THAT I MEAN THAT THAT THAT'S ONLY UNDERSTAND THE PRESENTATION AND TO THEM AND- WHY THEY WANT FLEXIBILITY EXCELLENT BE SURE THAT WE- SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT OVER- THE FLEXIBILITY SO THAT- THAT ULTIMATELY THAT THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY FOR. HOW HOW FUNDS ARE ACTUALLY SPENT THANK YOU. WE'RE LOOKING FOR FLEXIBILITY WITH ACCOUNTABILITY OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK WILL MOVE NOW ON TO UNLESS I'M MISSING SOMETHING AGAIN DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES ISSUE NUMBER FOR CHILD WELFARE PANDEMIC RESPONSE PROPOSALS. GREAT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ASSASSIN AND SENATOR DOCTOR DOCTOR PAN- FOR- GIVE ME A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT A HANDFUL OF IMPORTANT ITEMS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL- ITEMS FOR IS THE CITY TO THE CHILD WELFARE PANDEMIC RESPONSE AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. DO YOU NEED SOME VERY CRITICAL NEEDS- I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT LARGELY THE THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS INTENDED TO REPLICATE. WHAT HAPPENED WHAT THE INVESTMENTS THAT WERE MADE IN THE SPRING- SOME OF THOSE WERE DISCUSSED AT A RECENT ARE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OUR PROBATE- COMMITTEE MEETING. BACK. IN THE FALL. AND PROPOSALS ALSO INCLUDE- THE MOST PART THE CURRENT. I REQUEST AND A BUDGET RIGHT YOUR REQUEST. SHOULD NOTE ALSO THAT FIGURES FOR ON PAGE SIXTEEN OF THE AGENDA AS- LAYS OUT THAT THE FUNDING REQUEST VERY SPECIFICALLY AND SO. AS A RESULT I WON'T DIE NECESSARILY GET INTO ALL THAT THAT THAT DOLLARS AND CENTS OF EACH OF THE PROPOSALS BUT WOULD LIKE TO. BRIEFLY DESCRIBE TO YOU THE IMPORTANCE OF. EACH ONE AND SO. WITHOUT OBJECTION THAT EITHER PROPOSALS ARE KIND OF ALL A BUNDLED UP ON THE ON THE CHART. RESPECT TO SUPPORT FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE FORMERLY NON MINOR DEPENDENTS THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WERE IN OUR EXTENDED FOSTER CARE SYSTEM THAT WOULD HAVE LOST ELIGIBILITY AT AGE. TWENTY ONE THE DISEASE THIS PROPOSAL IS. IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE- THESE YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE. HAS RESORCES AND SUPPORT- DURING THE DURING THE PANDEMIC IN SO THAT THE PROPOSAL IS TO PROVIDE SOME FINANCIAL SUPPORT SH- EQUIVALENT TO WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE RECEIVED IN A FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT. AND SOME BASIC CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES FROM. FROM THE FROM THE COUNTY. WITH RESPECT TO ASSISTANCE FOR EMERGENCY CARE GIVERS THIS THIS PROPOSAL IS VERY POOR PROPOSAL ACKNOWLEDGES THE FACT THAT HAS- FAMILIES ARE TRYING TO GET APPROVED TO BECOME RESOURCE FAMILIES THROUGH THE RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS. JACOBSON AND ISSUES RELATED TO. THE PANDEMIC THAT HAD MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO GO THROUGH THIS THE SYSTEM AS DESIGNED AS SMOOTHLY AS DESIGNED AND THEREFORE- THIS IS THIS PROPOSAL IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO OUR RELATIVE CAREGIVERS WHO STEP UP TO- TO ACCEPT A- MEMBER OF THEIR FAMILY INTO THEIR THEIR CHAIR. AS A RESULT OF AN EMERGENCY THAT'S RELATED TO- THAT THAT THE CHILD'S PARENTS AND SO THIS PROPOSAL PER. FUNDS FUNDS THE EMERGENCY- UP US PROVIDES EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE TO THE CARE GIVERS WELL THEY ARE MAKING THEIR WAY THROUGH THAT RESOURCE FAMILY APPROVAL PROCESS. WITH RESPECT TO SUPPORT FOR RESOURCE FAMILIES AGAIN THIS PROPOSAL SPEAKS TO THE ABILITY AND THE NEED TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES- THAT FOR FAMILIES FOR RESOURCE FAMILIES FOSTER PARENTS AND AT THE LIKE THAT ARE. WHO IS YOUR WHO WHOSE CHILDREN IN THEIR CARE ARE ARE GRAPPLING WITH CODE RELATED ISSUES AND SO THIS- THIS PROPOSAL ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE- THROUGH OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES. A NUMBER OF- OF FLEXIBLE OPTIONS PROVIDE TO PROVIDE A DISH RESOURCE TO DEAL WITH- THE ISSUES ARE SO OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH QUARANTINE AND ISOLATION. THERE'S A THERE'S A REQUEST FOR FUNDING FOR STATE ADMINISTERED CONTRACTS AS WELL AND SIMILARLY AS AS WE DID IN THE SPRING WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE IS TO CONTINUE SOME OF THE CONTRACTS THAT SUPPORT. FAMILIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS SPECIFICALLY THERE IS A REQUEST FOR RESOURCES TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE- THE WARM WINDS THAT WE THAT WE STOOD UP SOME TIME AGO- THERE'S FUNDING FOR- SOME CONTRACTS WE USED TO. DIRECTLY COMMUNICATE WITH WITH CARE GIVERS AROUND THEIR THEIR NEEDS- THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS THIS ALSO ALLOWS US TO WORK WITH THEM IN A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS TO CONTINUE TO PROTECT TECHNOLOGY IN THE HANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM FOR OR I DISTANCE LEARNING AND FOR TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TELEHEALTH AND OTHER OTHER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES. THE REQUESTED THIS TO. US ACCORDING AT RISK FAMILIES THROUGH THE THROUGH THE FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER SO IF YOU MAY RECALL FROM THE THIS SPRING- THERE IS A HUNDRED OVER A HUNDRED SEVENTEEN THOUSAND FAMILIES SERVED WITH THAT YOU KNOW DIRECTLY TO SERVICES AND SOME. REFERRALS TO STATE AND FEDERAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE- THROUGH OUR FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS THAT THAT THAT FUNDING- WAS ONE WAS A TIME LIMITED WE'RE SUGGESTING THAT GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT WE- CONTINUE. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GOODS AND SERVICES THROUGH THAT THE NETWORK OF FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS ARE BOTH IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND IN THE CURRENT YEAR. WE ALSO ARE SO DOES THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES FINDING IT- REQUEST FOR FUNDING TO SUPPORT DIRECTLY SUPPORT ASK AT RISK FAMILIES KNOWN TO THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM TO AVOID THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE ARE COMING INTO FOSTER CARE. AND SO- THIS IS THIS IS A CURRENT YEAR ONLY PROPOSAL IN THE- IN THE- IN THE BUDGET. SIMILAR TO. THE ACTIVITIES WEEK THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE SPRING WE'RE SUGGESTING THAT WE PROVIDE A DIRECT FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO- TO FAMILIES. THROUGH THROUGH THE THROUGH THE USE OF- OUR TO MEDIUM OF A PREPAID CARDS AND SO THIS WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO THOSE FAMILIES TO ADDRESS NEEDS THAT- MAY HAVE RESULTED AS A RESULT OF. LOSING THEIR JOB OR OTHER- OTHER FINANCIAL PRESSURES THAT THEY MAY. THEY MAY SEE. SO THAT'S THE OVERVIEW OF THE- OF THE VARIOUS- OF PROPOSALS THAT ARE KIND OF BUNDLED UP INTO INTO THE CHART ON- ON PAGE SIXTEEN. THE NEXT QUESTION IN THE AGENDA SPEAKS TO- ONE OF THE FUNDING- THAT WE HADN'T HAD LAST YEAR FOR SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES. QUESTION SPECIFICALLY ASKS. YES- IF COUNTY CONTINUED. TO DO THOSE WORK THAT WORK AND SO-HOW IS IT FUNDED. GIVEN THE LIMITED THAT THOUGH THE LITTLE THE ONE TIME NATURE OF THE LIMITED THE TIME SHOP THE TIME THAT THE TIME LIMITED NATURE OF THE FUNDING AT THAT WAS PROVIDED IN THE SPRING OF MOST OF THOSE MOST OF THE PROGRAMS WERE ACTUALLY ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT WITH SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT- THROUGH A COUNTY CHILD WELFARE. THE COUNTY CHILD WELFARE WORKERS FORCED. THESE THESE. THESE PROGRAMS DID- DO YOU SEE SAID DAD WILL WIN THE FUNDING LAST DAY AT WORK AS LONG AS THE FUNDING TERM WAS TERMINATED OR AS THE FUNDING RAN OUT OF BASED ON IT'S TIME LIMITED NATURE THAT SAID THERE WAS A COUPLE OF A COUPLE OF ITEMS THAT DID CONTINUE ONE WAS AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THE DEPARTMENT WAS ABLE TO REPURPOSE SOME RESOURCES TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE WARM WIND THAT. THAT CREEK THAT PROVIDED SUPPORT TO FAMILIES IN THE COMMUNITY AND DIRECTLY RECALL REFERRED THEM TO OTHER RESOURCES INCLUDING- THAT CONTRACT ALSO INCLUDED DIRECT- SUPPORT GROUPS FOR A NUMBER OF FAMILIES- DURING THAT TIME PERIOD IN THE SPRING THAT HAS CONTINUED ON THE OTHER THE OTHER ISSUES THE OTHER ITEM THAT HAS CONTINUED WITHOUT WAS KING IT IS CONTINUING AS WE SPEAK WAS AS A RESULT OF THE BUDGET ACTIVE- LAST YEAR SO THAT WE ARE. CONTINUING. TO SUPPORT- THE R. FINANCIAL SOMETIME NEED TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WOULD HAVE A OUT OF OUR- FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. CHINESE ARE FUNDED ALSO TO PROVIDE SOME CASE MANAGEMENT TO. TO THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE. BY MY COLLEAGUE JUSTIN FREITAS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WILL. TAKE ON QUESTION THREE SECTION THANK YOU THANK YOU. GO AHEAD PLEASE.

WHICH CAPITAL GO. I WOULD HOPE SO OKAY. THE DENTAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OKAY HELLO. PLEASE THE SHORT GOOD AFTERNOON- ANGELA SHORT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DON'T HAVE ANY PARTICULAR CONCERNS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED ACTIONS FOR COVERT RESPONSE WITHIN CHILD WELFARE AS YOU HEARD THESE PROPOSALS- WOULD ALL BE CONTINUING OR OR RE LAUNCHING ACTIVITIES THAT HAPPENED EARLIER IN TWENTY TWENTY AND THAT SIR VERY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WITHIN THE CHILD WELFARE SSTEM. RATHER OUR QUESTIONS ARE REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS AND OUR QUESTIONS REFLECT- THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN YOUR AGENDA SO SPECIFICALLY- IF THE LEGISLATURE DOES WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROPOSALS IN THE CURRENT YEAR WHAT WOULD BE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED MECHANISM TO DO SO I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES- TO UNDERSTAND THAT MECHANISM AND- BE IN CONTACT WITH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- AND JUST. ONE OTHER QUESTION WE HAVE IS- IF THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER ANY ADDITIONAL PANDEMIC SUPPORT NEEDS WITHIN CHILD WELFARE BEYOND WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED A FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER- FUNDING SOME DIRECT SUPPORT FOR ALL RESOURCE FAMILIES. AND A SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAM PROVIDERS WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC.

OF CALLS OFTEN RELATED TO THAT. THAT ATTENTION THAT MANY HAVE. MAY DAY MAY GIVES TO- TO THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE STATE CLICK SO STABLE I PREFER TO THEM WHAT NURTURE HOMES AND- WITH THE RECENT RELEASE OF THE FOSTER CARE- BILL UPDATED FOSTER YOUR BILL OF RIGHTS- ADDITIONAL CALL VOLUME AND ASKS FOR TRAINING ARE COMING IN SO WITH- WITH THIS WITH THIS PROPOSAL AGAIN IS FOUR SIX POSITIONS- ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE FINAL BCP THAT I'D LIKE TO PRESENT TO YOU- IS- ARE MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT OF CHILD WELFARE SERVICES DATA QUALITY FIRST. C. O. U. S. C. M. S. CARES WHICH IS A LOT OF A LOT OF- WHAT WORDS IN THE TITLE REALLY WITH THIS WHEN DID WITH THIS IS KEEP GETTING AT IS. THAT OUR CURRENT CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. RECIEVES WILLIAMS MILLION OF DATA ENTRY- DATA ENTRIES AND DATA. BOTH WALLACE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA EACH YEAR. AS AS WE HAVE BECOME AS YOU HAVE BECOME AND AS OTHERS HAVE BECOME MUCH MORE. INTERESTED IN DATA DRIVEN DECISION MAKING THE QUALITY OF THE DATA OBVIOUSLY NEEDS TO BE- HE OF HIGH QUALITY IN ORDER TO MAKE DECISIONS ARE INFORMED THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY. ADDITIONALLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS REQUIRED. ONGOING MONITORING OF DATA QUALITY. WITH RESPECT TO A NUMBER OF ITS FEDERAL REPORTS ON OUT ON OUTCOMES ON FEDERAL ELIGIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO FOSTER CARE FUNDS AND A NUMBER OF AUTHORIZATIONS FOR VARIOUS EXPENDITURES WITHIN THE- THAT WHAT. INFORMATION THAT'S WITHIN THE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM- AND SO BY GETTING THIS THIS REQUEST IS- TO CONTINUE TO WORK THAT ONE UNIT. HEADED BY A MANAGER FOR ANALYSTS HAVE BEEN DOING- TO IMPROVE OUR DATA QUALITY WE SEE THIS IS ONGOING WORK AND THEREFORE. THE NEW IS WE'RE ASKING FOR NEED TO BE FROM JEOPARDY TO OUR- THANK YOU. THERE IS A QUESTION A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ALSO IF I COULD- AS A SERVICE HE ADDED WITH THE WITH THIS ISSUE IN THE IN THE AGENDA- ONE OF WHICH IS ACCESS TO SPEAK TO A RESOURCES THAT WERE RECENTLY PROVIDED TO THE DEPARTMENT BY THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE AS PART OF OUR- WORK CHIU RETURNED A YOUNG PEOPLE TO- TO. CALIFORNIA THAT HAD BEEN IN. HOW TO STATE RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS IN THE QUESTION SPECIFICALLY ASKS HOW WILL THE REQUESTED POSITIONS HELP IN SERVING MONITORING THE ISSUE THAT WATER DEPARTMENTS PLAN SURE ISSUES ARE CARED FOR IN THE FUTURE AND WOULD WE KNOW TOO THAT- THE P. C. P. THAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER THAT THAT THE CHILDREN SERVICES POLICY AND PROGRAM SUPPORT THE C. P. IS THERE ARE SOME OF THE RESOURCES THAT WE- ARE. WOULD BE NEEDED TO CONTINUE THE WORK THAT WE STARTED WITH THE OUT OF STATE- HOME- REPATRIATION WORK. SPECIFICALLY THE WORK THAT WE DID WAS BUILT ON THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROCESS THAT THE- CURRENCIES THE OUR BRANCH HAD DEVELOPED AND REFINED TO OUR TO SUPPORT. COUNTIES IN IN LOCATING PLACEMENTS FOR YOUNG YOUNG PEOPLE WITH COMPLEX NEEDS AND IT WAS THAT PROCESS- THAT. COMBINATION WITH SOME REALLY IMPORTANT CONTRACT BINDING THE HATCH THAT ALLOWED US TO BRING BACK THE HUNDRED AND THIRTY OR SO YOUNG PEOPLE TO CALIFORNIA- WITH PLANS THAT WERE UNIQUELY TAILORED TO THEIR NEEDS AND SO SOME OF THESE RESOURCES FROM THAT BCP WOULD. DO OUR TO THE QUESTIONS YOU ASK CLEARLY WE ARE OUR WORK AS SHE HAS IT IS TRANSITIONING FROM BRINGING YOUNG PEOPLE BACK TO CALIFORNIA IN TWO. KEEPING THEIR- MEETING THEIR NEEDS AND THE PLACEMENT THERE OUR OR ADJUSTING THEIR PLACEMENT TO MEET THEIR NEEDS AND SO. THAT THE WORK THAT THE CCR BRANCH HAS BEEN DOING WITH. WITH THESE RESOURCES ALSO WILL. MARQUISATE NEED IS NEEDED TO CONTINUE THAT THE WORK FROM TRANSITIONING TO SUPPORT OF PLACEMENT PRESERVATION FOR THESE YOUNG PEOPLE THE LAST QUESTION IS WHAT WE IN THE WEST APARTMENTS PLANNED TO ENSURE THESE YOUTHS ARE CARED FOR IN THE FUTURE OBVIOUSLY THERE IS- THAT THAT. THERE IS THERE'S A LOT TO ANALYZE IT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO ASSESS THE NEEDS AND THE SERVICES FOR THIS POPULATION IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE WORK OUT OF OUR IT HAS BEEN STARTED THROUGH OUR WORK WITH. EIGHTY TWENTY EIGHTY THREE THAT WAS PASSED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE BY JANET SITES SOME ARE GAPS IN OUR SERVICE ARRAY- AND WE WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND THROUGH DILIGENT MONITORING AND SUPPORT OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WERE RECENTLY RETURNED TO CALIFORNIA. TO CONTINUE TO REFINE OUR- OUR SERVICE ARRAY. AND THE MANNER IN WHICH WE PROVIDE SERVICES TO THIS POPULATION. THE THIRD QUESTION IN THIS SECTION HAS TO DO WITH THE ON BUDGET AND HIS RELATIONSHIP TO PLACEMENT STABILITY. THROUGH THE PASSAGE- YEAH I THINK THEY'RE OFTEN THROUGH THE PASSAGE OF EIGHTY TWO TWO FOUR SEVEN AND SO WITH WITH RESPECT TO THE THIS QUESTION AND- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT- YES I THINK THAT'S I THINK I SAID EARLIER THERE THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF INTEREST FROM MANY. ON PLACEMENT STABILITY OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS INCLUDE AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF- RECENT BUDGET ACTIONS AND SOME LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS THAT THAT THAT- FOCUSED ON THE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF. HAVING YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE STABILITY IN THEIR LIVES. THE OFFICE OF THE AUTHOR OF THE FOSTER CARE OMBUDSMAN WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AT. THE TONE OF THIS ENTITY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT- HAS RECEIVED IN THE LAST. TWO FISCAL YEAR IS AN INCREASE OF OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND 22% WHAT OF COMPLAINTS RELATIVES TO. FOSTER FOSTER CARE. PLACEMENT STABILITY SOME OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE CHANGE OF LAW FROM- THE SO CALLED SEVEN DAY NOTICE TO THE FOURTEEN DAY NOTICE AND ALSO SOME OF THE LAW ALSO REQUIRES A NUMBER. OF PLACEMENT PRESERVATION STRATEGIES TO BE IN PLACE PRIOR TO- UP. TO PROVIDE A NOTICE THAT THE YOUNG PERSON. NEEDS TO NEEDS A NEW PLACE TO LIVE AND SO THE OFFICE OFFICE HAS BEEN RECEIVING THOSE CALLS HAS BEEN WORKING WITH THE- WITH THE THAT THE COUNTIES WHERE THAT THAT- WHERE THE COMPLAINTS ORIGINATED IN. AND THEY ARE- WORKING ALSO WITH THAT PRIVATE FOSTER FAMILY AGENCIES IN MAKING SURE THAT THE OF A CHILD A FAMILY TEAMS. ARE ARE OCCURRING AS AS REQUIRED AND THAT A NUMBER OF- STABILITY- PRACTICES HAVE BEEN TRIED AND- IT BASS OF ANY NOTICE AND SO THE FOSTER CARE ASA FOSTER CARE OMBUDSMAN- WELL IT'S DIFFICULT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HOW THE HOW. HAS ITS WORK DIRECTLY RESULTED IN- IN PLAY IN THE GYM CHANGE IN PLACEMENT STABILITY CERTAINLY FOR THEIR CASES IN WHICH THE FOSTER CARE OMBUDSMAN'S OFFICE IS. IT IS DIRECTLY. WORK FOCUSING ON WE HAVE SEEN ANOTHER OF POSITIVE PRESS- AND I THINK I'LL CONCLUDE MY REMARKS WITH THANK YOU THANK YOU MUCH AND I'M VERY WHERE THEY WERE. ABOUT FIVE MINUTES TO FROM SESSIONS BUT I WOULD ASK IF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS YES DEPARTMENT FINANCE. LET'S FACE FARM FINANCE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON THOSE PROPOSALS BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE HELLO.

NO LATER ARE THE USEFUL BROUGHT BACK ARE THEY ALL IN ONE FACILITY ARE THEY SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE STATE AND THEN. AND THEN MY QUESTION WOULD BE AND THEN HOW ARE THOSE EXTRA STAFF PEOPLE ARE THEY SUPPORTING THE FOR THE PROGRAMS ON THE GROUND OR THE PROVIDING. THE SUPPORT FROM THE STATE LEVEL FOR THE ARE WE ACTUALLY FUNDING POSITIONS- AND THEN I WOULD GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE OUR- OUR KIDS ARE STABLE. IT GOES BACK TO THE INITIAL PLACEMENT SO I HOPE OF PUTTING AS MUCH FOCUS ON THE PLACEMENT OF CHILDREN. AS WELL AS- SUSTAINING AND MAINTAINING A PLACEMENT. DR GRANT. OKAY THEN I THINK WE WILL RECESS THIS UNTIL WE ARE FINISHED WITH SESSION. ISSUE NUMBER SIX CONTINUING FROM. ONE TO FIVE. TO GET HAVE A PRESENTATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT. OKAY. MR ROSE. SORRY FOR CAUGHT YOU BY SURPRISE WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON ISSUE NUMBER SIX. THANK YOU NUMBER SIX IS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FAMILY FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES ACT MY COLLEAGUE JUSTIN FREITAS WILL COVER THAT STARTED WITH QUESTION NUMBER ONE AND THEN I'LL JUMP IN ON. WITH SOME PROGRAM ASPECTS OF THAT AND ANSWER THE FINAL QUESTIONS. FOR YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR FREITAS.

THE FEDERAL FAMILY PREVENTION SERVICES ACT OF OTHER FAMILIES FIRST PREVENTION SERVICE THANKS GIVE ME- YES TO- WORST. FINALIZING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE SHOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSAL- WE'RE ANTICIPATING ON HAVING SOMETHING AVAILABLE- WITHIN THE NEXT DAY OR SO TO SHARE WITH THE LEGISLATURE- THAT WILL INCLUDE IMPLEMENTATION OF PART ONE AS WELL AS- IMPLEMENTATION APART FOR. THE FUNDING THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ARE ASSOCIATED WITH. THE PART ONE REQUIREMENTS- BUT THAT WE WILL HAVE THE LANGUAGE ARE THERE WILL BE LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT'S INCLUDED. FOR PART ONE IMPLEMENTATION AS WELL. THANK YOU AGAIN GREAT ROSE FOR THE DEPARTMENT NOT SPEAK I THINK. MISTER FREEZE MENTIONED THAT- THE FUNDING IS AVAILABLE FOR IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR PART FOR- IN THAT AND- AND NOT FOR PART ONE JUST WANTED TO REITERATE CHECKS I WASN'T SURE IT WAS ENTIRELY CLEAR- AND THEN I WITH RESPECT TO THE PLAN THE PLAN ITSELF SO THE IN ORDER TO. TO OPERATIONALIZE THE FEDERAL. I ACT WE- WITH THE DEPARTMENT DOES NEED TO SUBMIT A PREVENTION SERVICES PLAN. TO THAT END WE HAD SOME STAKEHOLDER- GATHERINGS- PRIOR TO ECHO THAT ACTUALLY ANNIE AND GATHERED. INPUT AT THAT POINT. AND ARE CONTINUING TO DO SO. UPDATE ON WHERE WE ARE AT THE MOMENT IS THAT WE HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL STAKEHOLDER- SUNDAY OF LAST WEEK IT WAS A TWO DAY SUMMIT DAY ONE AT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY PARTICIPANTS THAT- CHIU- THAT LEARN. MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE ACT AND- ESPECIALLY RELATIVE TO THE PREVENTION SERVICES ASPECT OF IT AND- THEN THE STATE SHE WAS COUNTY TEAMS WE HAD ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FOLKS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THAT. THE FRAMEWORK OF THE PLAN IS BEING DRAFTED IS CONSISTENT WITH. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL- AND- WE ANTICIPATE A AND ON- JULY AUGUST WINDOW IN WHICH WE WOULD SUBMIT A PLAN FOR OCTOBER APPROVAL. BEFORE THAT TIME WE INTEND TO HAVE. AT LEAST TWO DRAFTS AVAILABLE FOR STAKEHOLDER COMMENT- IN SOME WEBINARS TO SEEK SUCH COMMENT AND WE HAVE COMMITTED TO OUR TRIBAL. COMMUNITY TO HAVE TRIBAL CONSULTATION AND- WE- SO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE AT A DISTANCE WITH THE- WITH THE OUR PROGRAMMATIC ASPECTS OF FAMILY FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES ACT PREVENTION SERVICES PLAN. WITH RESPECT TO- THAT THE NEXT QUESTION YOU ASKED. WAS- WELL THIS IS TO ABOUT FAMILY PRESERVATION AND FAMILY- AND FAMILIES MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS. LET ME LET ME JUMP INTO THOSE- IF I CAN BE BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS THE ONLY MAINTENANCE AND FAMILY PRESERVATION ARE IN ESSENCE OPTIONAL PLAN OPTIONAL PROGRAMS- FOR COUNTIES TO ADMINISTER SAID I'LL STATE AND WANTED A TIME IF I MAY BE THE- FAMILY MAINTENANCE. PROGRAM CURRENTLY HAS 240-009-0060 THREE CHILDREN BEING SERVED IN A THESE ARE THESE ARE CHILDREN BEING SERVED IN IN THE FAMILY UP THERE IN THE HOME OF THEIR BIOLOGICAL FAMILY TO CLEAN THE SERVICES ARE ABOUT SIX MONTHS IN DURATION ALTHOUGH THEY CAN GO. UP TO A YEAR- THESE SERVICES ARE- SOMETIMES COURT ORDERED AND SOMETIMES VOLUNTARY AND THEY'RE USED TO IT TO STABILIZE THE FAMILY AND ADDRESS CHALLENGES THAT MAY BE. IMPACTING SAFETY. SOMETIMES ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE TIME THESE THIS THIS PROGRAM IS USED AS- KIND OF A- AFTER THE CHILD HAS BEEN REUNIFIED FROM FOSTER CARE WITH THAT WITH THEIR PARENTS. I'M STANDING AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO THE FAMILY- TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE REUNIFICATION PROCESSES ARE ARE SUPPORT. I SHOULD NOTE ALSO THAT TITLE FOR B. AND THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT AS THE PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE FOR THIS PROGRAM AND IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A FUNDING SOURCE THAT COUNTIES USUALLY GOES- CLAIM IN ITS ENTIRETY. BEFORE THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER AND MAKES UP ABOUT 1% OF THE TOTAL CHILD WELFARE SERVICES ON TO GRADUATE FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WITH RESPECT TO FAN PRESERVATION THEIR WEB PROGRAMS THERE WAS. ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO A LITTLE ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO THERE WAS A STATE FAMILY PRESERVATION PROGRAM THAT WAS INITIATED BY STATUTE. THE SHORT WINDOW OF TIME FOR CAN'T FOR COUNTIES TO KIND OF INNOCENCE OCT INTO FOURTEEN COUNTIES DID OPT INTO THAT PROGRAM. BACK IN IN THOSE DAYS. THE FUNDING WAS REALIGNED INTO THE TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN REALIGNMENT AND- THAT SEVENTEEN MILLION TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND- IS USED TO MATCH SOME FEDERAL FUNDS FOR PREVENTION AND- EARLY INTERVENTION AND POST ADOPTIVE SERVICES. THE SERVICES IN THE IN THE FAMILY PRESERVATION PROGRAM THAT THE FOURTEEN COUNTIES ARE OPERATE. INCLUDE THINGS LIKE COUNSELING- SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT- PARENTING SOME RESPITE SOME DAYS STATE TREATMENT TRANSPORTATION HOW MAKING A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS THAT WOULD MAKE. MAKE IT- MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR- FOR FAMILIES THAT ARE OVER BURDENED TO BE SUPPORTED TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN. IN THE HOME. THE LAST QUESTION IN THIS SECTION HOW TO DO WITH- POWELL PRESIDENT HOW WILL THE FAMILY FIRST PRESERVATION SERVICES THAT ENABLE CALIFORNIA TO- MORE CONTENT HELLO MORE COMPLETE CONTINUING. CONTINUING THE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN SHOULD NOTE THAT. THE THAT THE ACT IS IN AS I THINK MISTER FREEZE DESCRIBED EARLIER IS IN TWO PARTS THE WASHINGTON SEPARATE PARTS TO OUR REALLY REALLY GERMANE TO THIS DISCUSSION. WITH HER AND WITH IT IN THE BUDGET. ONE IS THE PREVENTION SERVICES ACT IN PART FOR IS THAT CONGREGATE CARE PIECE WITH RESPECT TO THE US THE PREVENTION SERVICES PIECE IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- A LOT OF THOSE- THIS OPTIONAL PROGRAM TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY STATES AN AVERAGE AND JURISDICTIONS. AND FROM A POP ON A POLICY BASIS IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IS THE FIRST TIME THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAD OUT OUTSIDE OF ANY CHILD WELFARE WAIVER DEMONSTRATION PROJECT HAS ALLOWED FOR. FEDERAL FUNDS THAT ARE TYPICALLY USED FOR CARE AND SUPERVISION OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN FOSTER CARE TO BE. USED FOR- PREVENTION INTERFOR CARES WHEN WE THE PREVENTION IN THE FAMILY FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES ACT IS PREVENTION INTO FOSTER CARE IT'S NOT. PREVENTION CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION IN A PUBLIC HEALTH. STANDPOINT LIKE PRIMARY PREVENTION OR SECOND YEAR. SO THAT. IT DOES ALLOW US. ADDED TO. THE STATE OUR COUNTY WITH OUR COUNTY COLLEAGUES IMPLEMENTING TO FOR THE FIRST TIME TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES- FOR- SERVICES TO PREVENT CHILDREN GOING INTO FOSTER CARE. CONGRESS HAS ATTACHED TO MANY STRINGS TO THESE FUNDS- THAT INCLUDED- THAT ONLY CERTAIN PROPORTIONS OF EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES ARE IDENTIFIED BY FEDERAL CLEARING HOUSE CAN BE USED. AND IT ALSO REQUIRES REQUIRES- THAT THE THAT STATES TO IMPLEMENT THE STANDARD OF- OF. CANDIDACY FOR FOSTER CARE WITCHING WHICH WILL REQUIRES THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD BE I AM AT RISK SO IT DOES ALLOW OUR PREVENTIONS ARE PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SHOULD JUST TO STRETCH A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE BIT MORE TOWARDS PREVENTION BUT THIS IS CERTAINLY NO- ARTICLED AT THE END OF A RAINBOW BUT IT IS. IMPORTANT POLICY CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. RESPECTIVE PARK FOR THEIR I THINK OF. IT ALSO ALLOWS US TO THINK ABOUT A MORE COMPLETE CONTINUUM OF CARE IN IS IN THAT ONE OF THE PROVISIONS AND PARKS FOR IS. IT ONE OF THE PROVISIONS IN PART FOR IS A- QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL NEEDS TO MAKE. MAKE A RECOMMENDATION FOR A YOUNG PERSON TO ENTER INTO CONCRETE CARE IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THEY NEED TO IT IS IT THEY NEED TO OFFERA KIND OF THE CLINICAL OPINION ABOUT WHETHER CONGRESS HERE MAKES THE MOST SENSE OR IF THERE ARE OTHER COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES THAT SHOULD BE. EMPLOYED IN ADVANCE OF THAT AND SO THIS THIS PROCESS WITH A LITTLE WITH A- EIGHTY EIGHT IT CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AS PART OF THE OF THE DETERMINATION TO GOING INTO OUT OF HOME CARE. AND WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S LIMITATION ON. YOUNG PEOPLE OF THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH YOUNG PEOPLE CAN BE PLACED IN CONGREGATE CARE ALSO WILL HELP. PUT SOME EMPHASIS ON THE ON THE SUPPORTED BUILDING OF COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. SIMILARLY THE PROVISION OF THE AFTER CARE PROVISION IN THE IN THE LAW. ALLOWS FOR ACTUALLY REQUIRES FOR. THE PROVISION OF AFTER CARE SERVICES AFTER EIGHTY EIGHT PLACEMENT EPISODE AND A SHORT TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC PROGRAM OR AS THEY'RE KNOWN IN SEVERAL. AND THESE AFTER CARE SERVICES LARGELY BEING CONCEPTUALIZED AFTER OUR WRAPAROUND MODEL. AGAIN HAVE THESE THESE HIGH QUALITY AND INTENSIVE SERVICES. MORE AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE TO BE PROVIDED IN A NUMBER OF SETTING SO. INTO TOTALITY I THINK THE FAMILY THIRDS PREVENTION SERVICE ACT DOES PROVIDE US WITH A BIT MORE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD OUT THE CONTINUE CARE ON AS WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT OVER THE YEARS. WITH THAT I THINK THAT CONCLUDES MY- MY REMARKS TO THIS SECTION OF. ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYTHING ELSE MISTER FREEZE FROM THE PART OF FINANCE. CHAU CON AND HAD JUST OPENED FOR ANY QUESTIONS. IF NEEDED OKAY LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE PLEASE. THANK YOU- DENTAL SHORT WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL FAMILY FIRST PREVENTION SERVICES ACT OF PSA- WITH THE UPCOMING FEDERAL DEADLINE OF OCTOBER FIRST- TO IMPLEMENT NEW CONGREGATE CARE REQUIREMENTS. WE EXPECT TO SEE PROPOSED LEGISLATION DETAILING HOW THIS IMPLEMENT IMPLEMENTATION WILL OCCUR- AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY THAT LEGISLATION IS NOT YET AVAILABLE BUT WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL BE AVAILABLE SOON- IN ADVANCE OF RECEIVING THAT LANGUAGE SO AND BEING ABLE TO REVIEW IT. MANY OF OUR INITIAL QUESTIONS ABOUT FF PSA IMPLEMENTATION- REALLY ARE MORE TECHNICAL FOR EXAMPLE DEPUTY DIRECTOR ROSE MENTIONED- A QUALIFIED INDIVIDUAL WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSESSING THE APPROPRIATE APPROPRIATENESS OF CONGREGATE CARE PLACEMENTS NOW WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT- WHO WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO FILL THIS ROLE- WHAT IS THE TIMELINE FOR IDENTIFYING AND SELECTING THE IS QUALIFIED INDIVIDUALS WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR TRAINING THEM. ETCETERA WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT MANY OF THESE MORE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS WILL BE ADDRESSED IN UPCOMING LANGUAGE AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO ENSURE WE FULLY UNDERSTANDS THAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ONCE IT'S AVAILABLE. AND THEN REGARDING- ACTIVITIES AIMED AT PREVENTING ENTRY INTO FOSTER CARE WHICH AGAIN- AS WAS NOTED THESE ACTIVITIES WILL BE NEWLY ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL TITLE FOR YOU FUNDING ONCE THE STATE HAS COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH FMVSS CONGREGATE CARE REQUIREMENTS- AGAIN WE HAVE A NUMBER. OF QUESTIONS THERE BUT WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT FORTHCOMING LANGUAGE- WILL HELP ADDRESS OUR QUESTIONS- BUT FOR EXAMPLE- ONE OF OUR INITIAL QUESTIONS AS WHETHER OR NOT- ANY GENERAL FUND FUNDING WOULD BE PROVIDED TO HELP COUNTIES- IT. INITIALLY IMPLEMENTED ANY OF THESE NEW ACTIVITIES BUT AGAIN- ONE. THE LANGUAGE IS A BILL WE WILL BE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THE- COMMITTEE STAFF TO COMMUNICATE FURTHER QUESTIONS AT THAT TIME THANK YOUNG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I GUESS I WILL- I WILL DO I WILL- JUST JOIN WITH THE L. A. O. AND SAYING WE COULD ASK A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS AND TECHNICAL ISSUES BUT I THINK IT DELUDE BEST IF WE CAN REACT TO THE PLAN ONCE IT'S PRESENTED. AND I WOULD JUST SAY IT'S GONNA BE BY OCTOBER AND WE'RE NOT COMPLIANCE SO. THAT I UNDERSTAND IS A PANDEMIC BUT AS AS EFFICIENTLY AS WE CAN DEVELOP THAT. AND BEEN WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND PARTNERS TO MAKE SURE CENTER KIND OF BEHIND THE CLOCK HERE THAT WE DON'T LEAVE THINGS OUT. DR GRANT. I GUESS THAT JUST BRIEFLY- IN TERMS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE F. F. PSA IT IS THIS GONNA IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTENT IS TO DO THIS PURELY THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS OR IS THERE A POLICY COMPONENT THEY'LL BE COMING FOR THE COMMITTEE ON HUMAN SERVICES. TWO GUYS THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- CENTER PANTSUIT THIS IS GOING TO BE- POLICY PROCESS THROUGH THE BUDGETS- THAT'S WHY WE ARE ANTICIPATING HAVING THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. THE COMPANY IN THIS TO YOU VERY SHORTLY- BUT THERE WILL NOT BE A POLICY AS A SEPARATE NON FISCAL POLICY BILL. IT'LL BE DISCUSSED THE BUDGET IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL. OKAY. I CAN CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND SOME OF WHY THAT'S THE CASE YES- YES THEY DO HAVE SOME CONCERN BECAUSE THERE'S SOME SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH AND I KNOW WE WORKED VERY HARD ON OUR CONTINUES CARE REFORM BEFORE AND THERE WAS A SUBSTANTIAL BODY OF WORK THAT WAS DONE NOT ONLY BY ADMINISTRATION ALSO BY THE LEGISLATURE- I THINK PRIOR TO THIS ADMINISTRATION. SO AS THE- YOU KNOW I AS THE PROCESS MOVES ALONG I THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO. ALSO ENGAGE THE POLICY CAN BE A CERTAIN LEVEL IN TERMS OF REVIEWING SOMEOF THE PROPOSED CHANGES THAT ARE COMING THROUGH I REALIZE THERE'S A TIME ISSUE- BUT- I JUST WANT TO BE. SURE THAT WERE WERE VETTING THIS POLICY PROPOSALS THOROUGHLY VETTED THE ORIGINAL CON CONTINUE OF CARE REFORM PROPOSALS AND- IS WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS SO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR PAN- AND SO I GUESS I WOULD ASK IN LIGHT OF THE- IT'S GOING TO THE BUDGET WHEN DO YOU THINK WE'LL HAVE THAT LANGUAGE AND ARE THERE ANY DRAFTS AVAILABLE FOR US AT THAT TIME AT THIS TIME THAT WE CAN START LOOKING AT. JUST REYES. YES ACTUALLY ADAM WE ANTICIPATE HAVING. FINALIZED LANGUAGE THERE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL WARNED TO SPENDING TODAY- BUT I DO WE DO HAVE- DRAFT LANGUAGE THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH WITH THE LEGISLATION EL AL. THE DOCUMENTS DID IT BE BECAUSE GOING THROUGH THE BUDGET WITH NO LEGISLATION IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE REALLY UNDERSTAND THE DETAILS OF THE FULL CONTINUUM OF CARE. ESPECIALLY AS CHANGES RELATED TO CHANGES. OKAY SO LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN APPROVED RELATIVE CARE GIVING FUNDING ELIGIBILITY. THANK YOU AGAIN GREG ROSE FOR THE DEPARTMENT IF I MAY JUST WANTED TO- MENTIONED THAT PRIOR TO THE RECESS- FOR THE FLOOR SESSION YOU AND HAD MADE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS MADE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS RELATED TO THE REPATRIATION REPATRIATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE BACK TO.
