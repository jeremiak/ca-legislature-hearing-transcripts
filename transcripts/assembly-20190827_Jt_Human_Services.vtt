IMPORTANT THINGS IS MAKING SURE

I UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE

00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:23.968
OVERSIGHT HEARING FOR THE

00:28:24.035 --> 00:28:27.072
FLATTENED BLOCK GRANT STATE

00:28:27.138 --> 00:28:27.605
PLAN WHICH WE DO EVERY TWO

00:28:27.672 --> 00:28:30.608
YEARS CORRECT. YES FOR FIRST

00:28:30.675 --> 00:28:32.477
AND BASICALLY HAD TO FORGIVE

00:28:32.544 --> 00:28:35.346
THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION SO.

00:28:35.413 --> 00:28:36.915
I WAS LOOKING AT FIRST OF ALL

00:28:36.981 --> 00:28:39.818
PEOPLE SERVICED I DID NOTE THAT

00:28:39.884 --> 00:28:40.785
AT LEAST ON THE SHEET I AVE

00:28:40.852 --> 00:28:42.253
ACTUALLY DOESN'T BREAK OUT WITH

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.389
TINO SO I AM TRYING TO FIGURE

00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:49.260
OUT. OUR WHO ARE SERVING IN

00:28:49.327 --> 00:28:51.996
TERMS OF OUR REP ETHNIC RACIAL.

00:28:52.063 --> 00:28:52.730
HE'S I WOULD POINT OUT I MEAN

00:28:52.797 --> 00:28:54.732
WE DO HAVE 19% OTHER SO IT'S

00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:56.134
HARD TO FIGURE OUT LIKE TO THE

00:28:56.201 --> 00:28:57.569
OTHER IS AND PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T

00:28:57.635 --> 00:28:59.804
REPORT. AS A MEMBER OF THE API

00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:01.773
CAUCUS I WOULD MAKE NOTED THAT

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.676
ASIANS ARE ONLY 5% OTHER WERE

00:29:04.742 --> 00:29:06.544
16% OF POPULATION AND I KNOW WE

00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:08.446
HAVE. TREMENDOUS INCOME

00:29:08.513 --> 00:29:10.115
DISPARITIES IN THE API

00:29:10.181 --> 00:29:12.817
POPULATION SICKLY. IN OUR

00:29:12.884 --> 00:29:14.052
PACIFIC ISLAND AGREES BUT ALSO

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:16.020
AMONG ASIAN COMMUNITIES SO. I

00:29:16.087 --> 00:29:18.790
GUESS ONE QUESTION IS WHY ARE

00:29:18.857 --> 00:29:24.662
WE SERVING SO FEW API. YEAH

00:29:24.729 --> 00:29:27.265
THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

00:29:27.332 --> 00:29:29.334
IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THAT'S

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.969
SOMETHING I DON'T HAVE A IN IN

00:29:31.035 --> 00:29:32.804
THE MEDIA ANSWER FOR PRESS

00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:33.705
SOMETHING COULD RESEARCH IF

00:29:33.771 --> 00:29:36.107
SOMEONE COULD PLEASE. GET BACK

00:29:36.174 --> 00:29:39.310
TO ME ON THAT SO AND ALSO AGAIN

00:29:39.377 --> 00:29:42.080
I MAKE NOTE THAT LATINOS ITEM

00:29:42.147 --> 00:29:43.615
ON THE LIST SO I CAN'T FIGURE

00:29:43.681 --> 00:29:46.017
OUT HOW WE'RE DOING WITH THAT

00:29:46.084 --> 00:29:47.552
AS WELL SO IN TERMS OF

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:49.053
REPORTING IT COULD BE GOOD FOR

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:51.055
US TO HAVE THE KIND OF DATA LET

00:29:51.122 --> 00:29:53.424
US KNOW. WHAT WE'RE DOING AND

00:29:53.491 --> 00:29:56.161
HOW WE MIGHT WANT TO RE DIRECT

00:29:56.227 --> 00:29:57.262
I REALIZE THAT THIS MAY BE ALL

00:29:57.328 --> 00:29:59.764
SELF REPORTED DATA SO THAT HAS

00:29:59.831 --> 00:30:01.399
ITS OWN CHALLENGES PEOPLE MAY

00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:04.302
NOT WANT TO BUT STILL IT BE

00:30:04.369 --> 00:30:06.738
GOOD TO HAVE A BREAK DOWN OF

00:30:06.804 --> 00:30:09.874
THAT THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD

00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:13.978
WAS. NOW IF YOU DO LISTS THAT I

00:30:14.045 --> 00:30:15.947
DO LISTA THESE ACTIVITIES. AS

00:30:16.014 --> 00:30:17.615
WELL I HEAR IT'S THIS WE HAVE

00:30:17.682 --> 00:30:19.083
SOME EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE GET

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:21.753
SERVICES THE LIVER AND A SO IN

00:30:21.819 --> 00:30:23.454
TERMS OF THE VALUATION SO FOR

00:30:23.521 --> 00:30:26.858
EXAMPLE. IN UNDER INCOME AND

00:30:26.925 --> 00:30:27.926
ASSET BUILDING SERVICES AND

00:30:27.992 --> 00:30:29.294
AGAIN YOU HAVE SEVERAL OF THEM

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.196
THE ONLY THIS IS SEVENTY FIVE

00:30:31.262 --> 00:30:32.297
THOUSAND PEOPLE SERVICES ARE

00:30:32.363 --> 00:30:34.766
DELIVERED BUT- ONLY TWENTY FOUR

00:30:34.832 --> 00:30:36.034
ARE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.536
SAID THEY INCREASE OR SAVINGS.

00:30:38.603 --> 00:30:41.206
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE

00:30:41.272 --> 00:30:41.773
THOUSAND PROXIMALLY RECEIVE

00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:43.408
HOUSING ASSISTANCE SERVICES.

00:30:43.474 --> 00:30:44.909
ONLY SEVENTY THOUSAND WHICH IS

00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:46.878
LESS THAN HALF A RECEIPT OF

00:30:46.945 --> 00:30:49.647
RACIAL TERROR AND SO FORTH. SO

00:30:49.714 --> 00:30:50.782
I'M TRYING TO GET A BETTER

00:30:50.848 --> 00:30:53.051
HANDLE ON THE OUTCOMES

00:30:53.117 --> 00:30:54.252
ABDULAZEEZ ARE CHALLENGING

00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:56.421
PROBLEMS RIGHT CELL AND I MEAN

00:30:56.487 --> 00:30:57.555
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE CRITICAL

00:30:57.622 --> 00:30:59.557
AND SAYING THAT WELL. HE HELPED

00:30:59.624 --> 00:31:00.558
LESS THAN HALF OF THEM I MEAN

00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:02.594
THEIR CHILDREN AS PROBLEMS BUT

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.863
IN TERMS OF THE EVALUATION. I

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.498
THINK IT BE HELPFUL TO HAVE

00:31:07.565 --> 00:31:08.967
SOMETHING THAT. AND BETTER

00:31:09.033 --> 00:31:12.036
REFLECT. BOTH WHAT'S BEING DONE

00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:13.671
AND THE REASONS FOR THE

00:31:13.738 --> 00:31:15.640
OUTCOMES THAT WERE ACHIEVED ANY

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:18.676
AYE SO I HAVE A HARD SENSE. TO

00:31:18.743 --> 00:31:21.079
GET TO FEEL WHETHER IS THAT

00:31:21.145 --> 00:31:22.547
GOOD ENOUGH NOT GOOD ENOUGH IT

00:31:22.614 --> 00:31:24.682
CETERA SO. IS THERE SOME PLACE

00:31:24.749 --> 00:31:26.784
THAT THERE'S A REPORT THAT

00:31:26.851 --> 00:31:28.253
ACTUALLY SAYS WELL THIS IS WHAT

00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:30.321
WE'VE DONE AND THIS IS WHAT THE

00:31:30.388 --> 00:31:35.059
EXPECTED OUTCOME WAS AND. WE

00:31:35.126 --> 00:31:35.693
EITHER HIT THE MARKET WE DIDN'T

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:40.298
HIT THE MARK ON THOSE THINGS.

00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:42.300
IT'S NOT IT'S NOT TO MENTION.

00:31:42.367 --> 00:31:46.671
OKAY SO YOU KNOW IT'S THIS IS A

00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:47.438
NEW REPORTING WE'RE WE'RE

00:31:47.505 --> 00:31:48.506
MAKING THOSE DISTINCTIONS

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:51.209
BETWEEN SERVICES AND OUTCOMES

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:52.176
AND POOR OUTCOMES AND THE

00:31:52.243 --> 00:31:54.679
NUMBER OF FOLKS SIR AND SO WHAT

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:56.881
WE CAN DO IS WE CAN GO AFTER

00:31:56.948 --> 00:31:57.915
FOLLOWING THE HEARING I COULD

00:31:57.982 --> 00:31:59.384
DO SOME FURTHER RESEARCH THIS

00:31:59.450 --> 00:32:00.852
IF WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION THAT

00:32:00.918 --> 00:32:02.253
COULD EXPLAIN SO WHAT WOULD BE

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.322
HELPFUL AS HAVING A BETTER

00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:06.491
DESCRIPTION OF YOUR EVALUATION

00:32:06.557 --> 00:32:07.992
PLAN OF WHAT SORT REPORTS WE

00:32:08.059 --> 00:32:11.729
EXPECT. BACK SO WE KNOW IT IT

00:32:11.796 --> 00:32:13.064
IT AND I SHOULD I JUST IT ALSO

00:32:13.131 --> 00:32:15.767
JUST SAY IT I MY BACKGROUND

00:32:15.833 --> 00:32:16.701
ACTUALLY OF THE ONLY

00:32:16.768 --> 00:32:18.703
PEDIATRICIAN I ACTUALLY WAS A

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:19.537
PROFESSOR AND TO ME THAT

00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:22.040
ELEMENT AT UC DAVIS COMMUNITY

00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:24.575
BUILDING IS SOMETHING THAT I

00:32:24.642 --> 00:32:26.010
CARE A LOT ABOUT THIS TALK TO

00:32:26.077 --> 00:32:26.911
MY STAFF AND I MEAN THAT'S

00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:29.514
THAT'S WHAT WE DID SO WHAT DOES

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:30.648
BLACK GRANT DOES WHAT YOU DO IS

00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:32.250
RIGHT IN LINE WITH THAT SO IN

00:32:32.317 --> 00:32:33.584
THAT SENSE IT OUT AND I WANT

00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:36.487
YOU TO CONTINUE DOING IT OKAY

00:32:36.554 --> 00:32:37.755
BUT I'M ALSO ASKING SOME THESE

00:32:37.822 --> 00:32:39.590
QUESTIONS BECAUSE I. WANT OF A

00:32:39.657 --> 00:32:41.526
LITTLE BIT OF YOU KNOW WE WANT

00:32:41.592 --> 00:32:43.528
TO STEP IT UP HERE A LITTLE BIT

00:32:43.594 --> 00:32:44.595
AND REALIZE THAT THERE'S ALSO

00:32:44.662 --> 00:32:45.229
FEDERAL GRANT YOU HAVE FEDERAL

00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:47.965
CONSTRAINTS I KNOW THAT WHEN

00:32:48.032 --> 00:32:48.633
YOU GO TO THE BUDGET

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.101
SUBCOMMITTEE PRIDE HAVE TO GO

00:32:50.168 --> 00:32:52.036
THROUGH SOME OF THAT AS WELL

00:32:52.103 --> 00:32:54.672
BUT I THINK THAT EIGHT SOME OF

00:32:54.739 --> 00:32:57.909
THE LA I DO THINK THAT YOUR

00:32:57.975 --> 00:33:01.546
AGENCY DOES AND CAN MAKE A BIG

00:33:01.612 --> 00:33:02.246
DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES

00:33:02.313 --> 00:33:04.782
OFTENTIMES OF SAMPLE THE STUDY

00:33:04.849 --> 00:33:07.585
LOOKING AT WELL WHAT HAPPENS.

00:33:07.652 --> 00:33:10.388
WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE IN POVERTY

00:33:10.455 --> 00:33:11.255
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THIS IS

00:33:11.322 --> 00:33:12.156
ABOUT RIGHT DISCUSS ALL THE

00:33:12.223 --> 00:33:13.491
BACK TO YOU KNOW PRESENT

00:33:13.558 --> 00:33:14.659
JOHNSON'S ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY

00:33:14.726 --> 00:33:15.960
OLDER AND I AM THIS PROGRAM IT

00:33:16.027 --> 00:33:18.863
STARTED BEFORE I WAS BORN IT'S

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:20.064
BUT IT REALLY WAS ABOUT FIGURE

00:33:20.131 --> 00:33:23.634
OUT HOW DO WE BILL DOES THAT

00:33:23.701 --> 00:33:25.803
SOCIAL CAPITAL THE SODAS

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:28.573
LINKAGES BETWEEN PEOPLE AND-

00:33:28.639 --> 00:33:30.341
THE FACT IS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:33:30.408 --> 00:33:32.910
IN POVERTY OFTEN HAVE FEWER

00:33:32.977 --> 00:33:34.946
CONNECTIONS RIGHT AND IT'S ONE

00:33:35.012 --> 00:33:36.180
OF THE ISSUES NOT OBVIOUSLY

00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:37.849
THEY ALSO A FEW RESOURCES RIGHT

00:33:37.915 --> 00:33:45.490
SO YOU WILL HAVE FEWER.

00:33:45.556 --> 00:33:46.124
RESOURCES AND FEWER CONNECTIONS

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:51.396
SO EVEN. A. GET OUT SO EVEN IF

00:33:51.462 --> 00:33:53.231
WE GIVE PEOPLE MORE RESOURCES.

00:33:53.297 --> 00:33:54.165
THAT I ITSELF WILL BE HELPFUL

00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:55.933
BUT MAY NOT NECESSARILY HELP

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.701
THEM AS MUCH AS WE CAN ALSO

00:33:56.768 --> 00:33:57.502
BUILD THOSE CONNECTIONS NEXT.

00:33:57.568 --> 00:33:58.436
WE WHAT I THINK AT LEAST MY

00:33:58.503 --> 00:33:59.637
READING AS IS WHAT YOU ARE

00:33:59.704 --> 00:34:00.271

YEARS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE DOING

00:34:25.263 --> 00:34:26.964
DIFFERENT FOR THIS NEXT TWO

00:34:27.031 --> 00:34:28.299

OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING ON

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:02.386
OUR AND SHE PROGRAMS. BECAUSE

00:42:02.453 --> 00:42:03.187
DEFINITELY THERE'S A DIRECT

00:42:03.254 --> 00:42:06.123
ACCESS TO THE HOME. THE HOME WE

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.925
ABILITY ASIAN THAT OF THE OUR

00:42:07.992 --> 00:42:10.327
PROGRAMS PROVIDE. AND NOT ONLY

00:42:10.394 --> 00:42:13.063
FOCUSING ON ENERGY REDUCTION.

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:16.533
AND CLIMB. IN GREENHOUSE GAS

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.802
REDUCTION. BUT ALSO CAN BE USED

00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:19.503
OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:21.372
LIVING CONDITIONS OF THOSE

00:42:21.438 --> 00:42:22.539
HOMES. AND DOING IT IN A WAY

00:42:22.606 --> 00:42:24.708
THAT WE CAN QUANTIFY WHAT THE

00:42:24.775 --> 00:42:27.611
IMPACTS ARE. WHEN EXAMPLE AND

00:42:27.678 --> 00:42:28.812
THERE'S BEEN SOME STUDIES THAT

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:30.781
HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN BY. PUBLIC

00:42:30.848 --> 00:42:33.284
HEALTH TERMS OF A PILOT THAT.

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:34.852
THEY SHOULD SOME LIGHT ON ARE

00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:37.288
THE PROGRAM'S ABILITY TO IMPACT

00:42:37.354 --> 00:42:39.590
AIR QUALITY. AND PROVIDE AIR

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:41.058
QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS WITHIN THE

00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:43.294
HOME. THAT COULD TO PROVIDE

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.995
POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR. YOUNG

00:42:45.062 --> 00:42:46.964
CHILDREN DEALING WITH ASTHMA OR

00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:50.267
OTHER. RESPIRATORY ISSUES. AND

00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:53.370
THEN ALSO WITH. WITH CLIMATE

00:42:53.437 --> 00:42:54.438
CHANGE AS IS OCCURRING IN OUR

00:42:54.505 --> 00:42:57.174
STATE AREAS WHERE. THERE'S A

00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:59.109
NEED FOR BETTER REGULATING OF

00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:01.445
INDOOR AIR TEMPERATURES. WHERE

00:43:01.512 --> 00:43:03.547
SOME OF ALL THE BALL THE BALL

00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:05.015
POPULATION MEMBERS. YOU KNOW

00:43:05.082 --> 00:43:06.951
CANNOT DEAL WITH. YOU KNOW

00:43:07.017 --> 00:43:09.019
EXTREME HEAT OR EXTREME COLD AS

00:43:09.086 --> 00:43:10.387
AN EXAMPLE. AND THEIR HOMES ARE

00:43:10.454 --> 00:43:11.722
NOT EQUIPPED TO PROVIDE YOU

00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:14.058
KNOW THAT. THEIR BASIC NEEDS OF

00:43:14.124 --> 00:43:15.159
REGULATING THE INDOOR AIR

00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:16.627
TEMPERATURE. SO IT'S SOMETHING

00:43:16.694 --> 00:43:18.028
THAT WE ARE DEFINITELY. GIVEN

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:19.029
SOME THOUGHT TO INSPIRE

00:43:19.096 --> 00:43:21.465
HEADING. AND THAT'S AN AREA OF

00:43:21.532 --> 00:43:23.334
FOCUS RIGHT NOW FOR THE PART.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:25.336
AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I MAY

00:43:25.402 --> 00:43:28.105
CHAIRS. NOTS TO HIGHLIGHT THE

00:43:28.172 --> 00:43:30.841
WORK OF. OUR CHAIR OF HUMAN

YEAR THERE IS STILL WORK TO BE

00:43:42.419 --> 00:43:47.791
DONE AND. OUR ABILITY TO MAKE

00:43:47.858 --> 00:43:48.425
SURE THAT ALL WORKING FAMILIES

00:43:48.492 --> 00:43:49.360
IN CALIFORNIA ARE TREATED

00:43:49.426 --> 00:43:49.827
EQUALLY AND GIVEN AN

00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:50.828
OPPORTUNITY. FOR A. I. T. C. IS

00:43:50.894 --> 00:43:51.295
SOMETHING I HOPE THE

00:43:51.362 --> 00:43:51.762
LEGISLATURE AND THIS

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:52.363
ADMINISTRATION. CAN WORK ON

00:43:52.429 --> 00:43:53.597
NEXT YEAR SO THAT YOUR

00:43:53.664 --> 00:43:55.466
ORGANIZATION. CAN CONTINUE TO

00:43:55.532 --> 00:44:01.538
HELP US WITHOUT WHICH- FUTURES.

00:44:01.605 --> 00:44:03.073
DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL

00:44:03.140 --> 00:44:03.640
QUESTIONS FROM WHICH TO WORK

00:44:03.707 --> 00:44:06.977
COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I DID WANT

00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:08.012
TO FOLLOW UP ON SOMETHING THE

00:44:08.078 --> 00:44:10.147
DOCTOR PAN MENTIONED ABOUT

00:44:10.214 --> 00:44:12.649
BUILDING WEALTH. IN THE

00:44:12.716 --> 00:44:15.119
DISCRETIONARY FUNDS CAN IS THAT

00:44:15.185 --> 00:44:16.754
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE USED TO

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.288
HELP WITH FIRST TIME HOME

00:44:18.355 --> 00:44:21.125
BUYERS WITH DOWN PAYMENTS IS

00:44:21.191 --> 00:44:22.960
THAT THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX

00:44:23.027 --> 00:44:27.998
IS THAT. NOT PART OF THIS BOX.

00:44:28.065 --> 00:44:30.134
FIVE MINUTES NOT NOT. NO I

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.403
PUSHED THE SENATE NOT ON OKAY.

00:44:32.469 --> 00:44:34.972
SO IF I MEAN I GUESS THE BEST

00:44:35.039 --> 00:44:35.906
WAY I WOULD DESCRIBE IT WOULD

00:44:35.973 --> 00:44:37.908
BE A CATCH TWENTY TWO BECAUSE

00:44:37.975 --> 00:44:39.443
WE'RE DEALING WITH PEOPLE THAT

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:40.744
ARE LIVING AT LESS THAN A 100%

00:44:40.811 --> 00:44:42.513
OF POVERTY LEVEL. SO WHEN

00:44:42.579 --> 00:44:43.847
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE

00:44:43.914 --> 00:44:45.682
THAT ARE AT THAT LOW INCOME A

00:44:45.749 --> 00:44:48.018
FAMILY OF FOUR THAT MAKES

00:44:48.085 --> 00:44:48.819
TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A

00:44:48.886 --> 00:44:50.521
YEAR EVEN WITH DOWN PAYMENT

00:44:50.587 --> 00:44:52.623
ASSISTANCE IT WOULD NOT BE A

00:44:52.689 --> 00:44:54.558
FAMILY THAT COULD SUSTAIN A

00:44:54.625 --> 00:44:56.627
MORTGAGE AND THEY BARELY CAN

00:44:56.693 --> 00:44:58.729
SUSTAIN SOMETIMES SUBSIDIZED

00:44:58.796 --> 00:45:00.731
HOUSING BECAUSE OF THE

00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:01.665
SITUATION THAT AROUND SO WE'RE

00:45:01.732 --> 00:45:04.034
DEALING WITH THE POPULATION.

00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:06.203
KIND OF BY FEDERAL DESIGN THAT

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:09.239
IS SO LOW INCOME THAT NOT ONLY

00:45:09.306 --> 00:45:11.208
OUR OUTCOMES HARDER BECAUSE YOU

00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:13.410
KNOW THAT DOCTOR PAN MENTIONED

00:45:13.477 --> 00:45:14.478
THAT THE I DON'T HAVE ANY

00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:16.680
SAVINGS WELL YOU KNOW ONCE

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:18.048
PEOPLE GET A. B. I. T. C.

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:19.850
CREDIT IT JUST TRYING TO KEEP

00:45:19.917 --> 00:45:21.185
THEM ABOUT WATER YOU KNOW THEY

00:45:21.251 --> 00:45:22.486
PAY THEIR BACK TO P. JEANNIE

00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:24.054
BELL OR THEIR BACK TO RANT

00:45:24.121 --> 00:45:25.789
BECAUSE- THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

00:45:25.856 --> 00:45:27.357
MONEY ON A MONTHLY BASIS TO

00:45:27.424 --> 00:45:29.359
MAKE ENDS MEET. AND SO THEY'RE

00:45:29.426 --> 00:45:31.628
CONSTANTLY MAKING A DECISION OF

00:45:31.695 --> 00:45:33.297
WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO PAY AND

00:45:33.363 --> 00:45:35.466
SO HE I. T. C. I ALWAYS SAY

00:45:35.532 --> 00:45:37.501
GIVE HIM SOME BREATHING ROOM.

00:45:37.568 --> 00:45:40.170
SO THAT THEY CAN CATCH UP AND

00:45:40.237 --> 00:45:42.372
MAYBE YOU KNOW NOT WORRY ABOUT

00:45:42.439 --> 00:45:43.907
WHERE THEIR NEXT MEAL IS GOING

00:45:43.974 --> 00:45:44.441
TO COME FROM OR IF THE

00:45:44.508 --> 00:45:45.876
LEVELLERS GONNA COME KNOCKING

00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:48.378
SO IT'S A GREAT IDEA IT'S JUST

00:45:48.445 --> 00:45:50.114
OUR PEOPLE ARE SO LOW INCOME

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.482
EVEN WITH THE DOWN PAYMENT

00:45:51.548 --> 00:45:52.683
ASSISTANCE TEST SUSTAINING

00:45:52.749 --> 00:45:57.054
MORTGAGE IN ALMOST ANY. COUNTY

00:45:57.121 --> 00:45:57.688
IN CALIFORNIA WOULD PROBABLY BE

00:45:57.754 --> 00:46:02.092
A LEAP OF FAITH. AND IS IT

00:46:02.159 --> 00:46:02.659
SOMETHING THAT IF ONE OF THE

00:46:02.726 --> 00:46:05.062
PROGRAM ONE OF YOUR- ANTES WERE

00:46:05.129 --> 00:46:06.029
TO FIND A WAY TO HELP ITH THIS

00:46:06.096 --> 00:46:06.864
AND OF COURSE THEN THE PAYMENT

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:08.532
WOULD BE THROUGH SUBSIDIZED.

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:11.935
HOUSING ASSISTANCE. IS THIS

00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:13.937
SOMETHING THAT IS COMPLETELY

00:46:14.004 --> 00:46:15.739
OUT OF THE QUESTION OR IS THIS

00:46:15.806 --> 00:46:16.340
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE WORKED

00:46:16.406 --> 00:46:19.910
ON. I DON'T THINK ANYTHING IS

00:46:19.977 --> 00:46:21.745
OUT OF THAT'S THE GREAT PART

00:46:21.812 --> 00:46:22.946
ABOUT C. S. B. G. AND I WOULD

00:46:23.013 --> 00:46:25.482
JUST SAY THAT TIME. DR RANDALL

00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:28.252
AS WELL IS EVERY TIME TWO YEARS

00:46:28.318 --> 00:46:29.920
EVERY COMMUNITY RIGHTS WHAT

00:46:29.987 --> 00:46:30.621
IT'S CALLED THE COMMUNITY

00:46:30.687 --> 00:46:33.190
ACTION PLAN IT GIVES THE

00:46:33.257 --> 00:46:35.826
DEPARTMENT A LOT MORE TEETH IF

00:46:35.893 --> 00:46:37.261
YOU GO TO THOSE PUBLIC MEETINGS

00:46:37.327 --> 00:46:38.829
OR EVEN IN WRITING MAKE

00:46:38.896 --> 00:46:40.030
STATEMENTS THAT HAVE TO BE

00:46:40.097 --> 00:46:41.865
INCLUDED IN THAT PLAN. THAT

00:46:41.932 --> 00:46:43.433
SAYS WHAT YOUR IDEAS ARE OR

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.334
WHAT YOU THINK IT'S AN

00:46:44.401 --> 00:46:47.271
IMPORTANT COMPONENT BECAUSE

00:46:47.337 --> 00:46:48.438
MANY TIMES THOSE AREN'T

00:46:48.505 --> 00:46:51.909
PARTICIPATED IN HIGHLY OR MAYBE

00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:53.443
PEOPLE COME AND THERE'S ONE OR

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:55.245
TWO AGENDAS INSTEAD OF MAYBE A

00:46:55.312 --> 00:46:56.580
BROADER AGENDA OF PEOPLE THAT

00:46:56.647 --> 00:46:58.682
AREN'T REPRESENTED SO. I WOULD

00:46:58.749 --> 00:47:01.652
ENCOURAGE STRONGLY ANY IDEAS

00:47:01.718 --> 00:47:03.287
THAT ANY OF YOU HAD OR ANY

00:47:03.353 --> 00:47:04.855
COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT I THINK

00:47:04.922 --> 00:47:05.923
COLLUDED IN THAT COMMUNITY

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:08.458
ACTION PLAN BECAUSE THAT'S HOW

00:47:08.525 --> 00:47:13.096
YOU GET CHANGE MADE IN THAT

00:47:13.163 --> 00:47:13.730
COMMUNITY IS WHEN THE COMMUNITY

00:47:13.797 --> 00:47:17.167
STATE THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED.

00:47:17.234 --> 00:47:18.035
AND TWO MORE QUESTIONS IF I

00:47:18.101 --> 00:47:20.103
MAY. ONE IS A FUNDS FOR DAKAR

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:20.971
RENEWAL I BELIEVE IS IN ONE OF

00:47:21.038 --> 00:47:23.440
YOUR PRESENTATION YES SO THESE

00:47:23.507 --> 00:47:25.242
FUNDS CAN BE USED FOR DOCKERY

00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:27.411
YES. HUH ALL RIGHT IT DID IT

00:47:27.477 --> 00:47:30.214
AGAIN THE REQUIREMENT IS THE

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.248
TO. THE TO QUALIFY FOR CIVIL

00:47:31.315 --> 00:47:36.520
CRACKED OKAY. MY LAST QUESTION.

00:47:36.587 --> 00:47:36.987
HAS TO DO WITH FEDERAL

00:47:37.054 --> 00:47:42.793
INVESTIGATIONS. SECTION SIX

00:47:42.859 --> 00:47:45.762
SEVEN SIX BE SEVEN TALKS ABOUT

00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:47.664
THIS PROVIDE AN ASSURANCE THAT

00:47:47.731 --> 00:47:48.565
THE STATE WILL PERMIT AND

00:47:48.632 --> 00:47:49.833
COOPERATE WITH FEDERAL

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:53.170
INVESTIGATIONS UNDERTAKEN IN

00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:53.737
ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION SIX

00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:57.641
SEVEN EIGHT D. DOES THIS

00:47:57.708 --> 00:47:59.943
INCLUDE IMMIGRATION STATUS SO

00:48:00.010 --> 00:48:02.713
IF THE FEDS ARE ASKING FOR

00:48:02.779 --> 00:48:03.247
PROGRESSION STATUS IS THAT

00:48:03.313 --> 00:48:03.814
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:08.986
PROVIDED IF THAT IS SOMETHING.

00:48:09.052 --> 00:48:10.554
AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

00:48:10.621 --> 00:48:11.188
HASN'T COME UP IN THE PAST AND

00:48:11.255 --> 00:48:13.557
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU A YOU POSE

00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:14.591
THE QUESTION AND THAT'S

00:48:14.658 --> 00:48:16.593
SOMETHING I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.695
BACK IN AND FOR THE RESEARCH TO

00:48:18.762 --> 00:48:20.731
GIVE YOU A CORRECT ANSWER.

00:48:20.797 --> 00:48:22.232
THANK YOU I CAN TELL YOU THAT

00:48:22.299 --> 00:48:24.334
EACH LOCAL COMMUNITY ACTION

00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:25.869
AGENCY HAS A LOCAL PLAN TO

00:48:25.936 --> 00:48:29.106
RESPOND. WE ONLY RESPOND IF

GIVE JUST BLANKET INFORMATION

00:48:34.645 --> 00:48:38.982
SO I THINK EVERY AGENCY. KIND

00:48:39.049 --> 00:48:40.017
IT DOES WHAT THEY FEEL

00:48:40.083 --> 00:48:42.085
COMFORTABLE WITH OBVIOUSLY ONCE

00:48:42.152 --> 00:48:43.153
THAT OUR ARMS OF LOCAL

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:45.455
GOVERNMENT. MIGHT RESPOND

00:48:45.522 --> 00:48:46.823
DIFFERENT THAN PRIVATE NON

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:49.626
PROFITS ARE WILLING TO RESPOND.

00:48:49.693 --> 00:48:52.429

HAVE. SECURE AREAS SO WE HAVE

00:49:03.373 --> 00:49:04.808
SIMPLEX ABILITY BECAUSE WORD

00:49:04.875 --> 00:49:06.209
NONPROFIT BUT I WOULD SAY THE

00:49:06.276 --> 00:49:08.245
AGENCIES THAT ARE ARMS OF LOCAL

00:49:08.312 --> 00:49:09.813
GOVERNMENT PROBABLY HAVE A
