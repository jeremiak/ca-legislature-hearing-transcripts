00:37:15.366 --> 00:37:17.501
WE THINK THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO

00:37:17.568 --> 00:37:19.270
OF RECOGNIZE THAT REALITY IS

00:37:19.337 --> 00:37:20.972
JUST TO RETURN TO THE PREVIOUS

00:37:21.038 --> 00:37:22.073
SYSTEM OF PROVIDING THESE

00:37:22.139 --> 00:37:23.841
AUGMENTATIONS ON A DISCRETIONARY

00:37:23.908 --> 00:37:25.176
BASIS RATHER THAN.

00:37:25.242 --> 00:37:28.145
ESTABLISHING YET ANOTHER FORMULA

00:37:28.212 --> 00:37:29.580
THAT MAKES THE BUDGET PROCESS

00:37:29.647 --> 00:37:34.952
LESS TRANSPARENT AND HARDER --

00:37:35.019 --> 00:37:37.888
FOR FOLKS TO FOLLOW TING FORMULA

00:37:37.955 --> 00:37:40.224

TO A TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN

00:37:47.565 --> 00:37:48.032
FOURTEEN ONE PROPERTY TAX

00:37:48.099 --> 00:37:50.034
COLLECTIONS INCREASED FOR COUNTY

00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:51.736
OFFICES OF EDUCATION THEIR STATE

00:37:51.802 --> 00:37:53.804
A DECREASE DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR WE

00:37:53.871 --> 00:37:54.939
DON'T ALLOW.

00:37:55.006 --> 00:37:56.741
COUNTY OFFICES TO RECEIVE HIGHER

00:37:56.807 --> 00:37:58.943
LEVELS OF FUNDING JUST BASED ON

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:00.544
THEIR PROPERTY TAX COLLECTIONS

00:38:00.611 --> 00:38:03.681
THE MINIMUM STATE AID PROVISION.

00:38:03.748 --> 00:38:05.383
PUTS A CAP ON HOW MUCH WE CAN

00:38:05.449 --> 00:38:06.917
REDUCE STATE FUNDING WHEN THOSE

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:08.419
PROPERTY TAX COLLECTIONS

00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:11.122
INCREASE CONSEQUENTLY THERE'S

00:38:11.188 --> 00:38:13.824
INCREASING DISPARITY BETWEEN --

00:38:13.891 --> 00:38:15.326
HOW COUNTIES ARE FUNDED BASED

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:17.328
SOLELY ON HOW MUCH PROPERTY TAX

00:38:17.395 --> 00:38:18.696
REVENUE THEY'RE COLLECTING?

00:38:18.763 --> 00:38:20.264
OUT WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:21.499
THESE INEQUITIES WE ALSO THINK

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:24.669
THERE ARE BETTER USES OF THE NOW

00:38:24.735 --> 00:38:26.137
OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

00:38:26.203 --> 00:38:27.405
THAT ARE GOING TO THIS FUNCTION

00:38:27.471 --> 00:38:28.906
BUT WE ALSO HAVE A CONCERN THAT

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:30.908
THE A GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT

00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:33.577
RECOGNIZE THE FULL COST OF THIS

00:38:33.644 --> 00:38:34.245
PROVISION.

00:38:34.311 --> 00:38:35.079
RIGHT NOW THEY THEY DON'T

00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:37.114
ACTUALLY PROJECT THE COSTS GOING

00:38:37.181 --> 00:38:38.949
FOR THE JUST HOLD THEM FLAT EVEN

00:38:39.016 --> 00:38:39.950
THOUGH THE INCREASE YEAR OVER

00:38:40.017 --> 00:38:41.352
YEAR WE WE THANK.

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:42.553

THIS IS SOMETHING WE THINK THE

00:38:57.234 --> 00:38:59.236
LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE THINKING

00:38:59.303 --> 00:38:59.603

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:20.264
INCREASING THAT RANKING AS WELL

00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:21.932
AND THAT WILL BE REFLECTED I GET

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:23.200
ALL THAT AND THAT'S IN A LONGER

00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:26.337
VERSION OF WHAT I SAID EARLIER

00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:26.904
IN MY STE MY STATEMENT THAT

00:43:26.971 --> 00:43:27.338
WE'VE.

00:43:27.404 --> 00:43:28.539
COME A LONG WAY AND RESTORED

00:43:28.605 --> 00:43:30.240
FUNDING IN THIS.

00:43:30.307 --> 00:43:32.710
PLAN BEFORE US DOES I THINK

00:43:32.776 --> 00:43:34.712
WITHIN THAT BUDGET CLIMATE.

00:43:34.778 --> 00:43:36.480
PUT AS MUCH AS WE CAN.

00:43:36.547 --> 00:43:38.615
TO SUPPORT OUR SCHOOLS AND LOOK

00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:39.683
FOR ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO HELP

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.018
DISTRICTS BACKGROUND TALK ABOUT

00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:43.153
THE PENSION BUT DO WE THINK AND

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:44.254
OUT OF THE GOVERNOR IS THAT

00:43:44.321 --> 00:43:46.390
STRONG EDUCATION CHAMPION HE RAN

00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:47.791
EDUCATION THAT'S THAT'S HIS

00:43:47.858 --> 00:43:49.126
THAT'S HIS BIG FOCUS IS PUBLIC

00:43:49.193 --> 00:43:50.394
EDUCATION.

DO WE THINK THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:54.932
ADEQUATELY FUNDED.

00:43:54.999 --> 00:43:57.201
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE A POSITION

00:43:57.267 --> 00:43:57.968
ON THAT BECAUSE THAT'S A

00:43:58.035 --> 00:43:58.902
DIFFICULT --

00:43:58.969 --> 00:44:01.438
WORD I THINK TO TO DEFINE I

00:44:01.505 --> 00:44:03.907
THINK WE WOULD SAY WE'RE DOING --

00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:06.143
WHAT WE CAN TO PRIORITIZE AS

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:07.711
MUCH AS POSSIBLE EDUCATION

HE HE APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE

00:44:18.122 --> 00:44:19.923

HANDLE THAT VERY WELL --

00:44:21.992 --> 00:44:23.761
BUT I I THINK YOU KNOW WE CAN WE

00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:24.561

BLAME THE GOVERNMENT APPOINT THE

00:44:26.697 --> 00:44:27.698
GOVERNOR ALSO THINK THIS BODY

00:44:27.765 --> 00:44:29.600
THE LEGISLATURE PLAYS A ROLE IN

00:44:29.666 --> 00:44:31.168
THIS EXERCISE.

00:44:31.235 --> 00:44:32.569
TO WEAR AND THEY ARE --

00:44:32.636 --> 00:44:33.504
YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUES RUN AND

00:44:33.570 --> 00:44:34.271
SAY THEY'RE ALL FOR EDUCATION

00:44:34.338 --> 00:44:36.273
FUNDING IN ADEQUATELY YEAH WHEN

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.741
IT COMES SO IN TIME. FOR THE

00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:40.711
BUDGET YOU KNOW WE NEED TO WE

00:44:40.778 --> 00:44:44.181
AND I THINK THAT'S IN ORDER TO

00:44:44.248 --> 00:44:48.352
BE PART SO BACK TO THAT BUT BUT

00:44:48.419 --> 00:44:49.353
AGAIN WROTE YEAH.

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.188
I DON'T SPEAK FOR THE GOVERNOR --

00:44:51.255 --> 00:44:52.689
BUT HE DID A GOOD JOB AGAIN

00:44:52.756 --> 00:44:53.424
FORGET --

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:55.592
BUT YOU KNOW IT IT ALSO SPEAKS

00:44:55.659 --> 00:44:57.061
TO OUR PRIORITIES TO IN THIS

00:44:57.127 --> 00:44:58.362
LEGISLATURE'S NEEDS TO LOOK IN

00:44:58.429 --> 00:44:59.430
THE MIRROR A BIT.

00:44:59.496 --> 00:45:00.431
TO SEE WHAT OUR PRIORITIES ARE

00:45:00.497 --> 00:45:02.099
BECAUSE OFTEN THEY LIVE WELL

00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:03.367
OUTSIDE.

00:45:03.434 --> 00:45:04.935
OF THE EDUCATION ARENA.

00:45:05.002 --> 00:45:07.271
YET AND SO WHAT WITH THAT AND

00:45:07.337 --> 00:45:09.573
WOULD THE ADMINISTRATION BE OPEN

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.275
TO OF OF COURSE YOU WERE SAYING

00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:12.409
IF WE CAN.

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:14.111
REDIRECT MONIES FROM THE

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:16.213
EXISTING STATE BUDGET FROM OTHER

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.881

00:45:21.652 --> 00:45:22.686
EDUCATION.

00:45:22.753 --> 00:45:23.987
IN A WORLD WILL DO AS MUCH AS WE

00:45:24.054 --> 00:45:25.722
CAN THERE BUT YOU KNOW IT'S ONLY

00:45:25.789 --> 00:45:27.391
SQUEEZING SO MUCH OUT YOU KNOW

00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:30.461
OF THE AND REALLOCATING THE THE

00:45:30.527 --> 00:45:31.462
PIE THERE.

00:45:31.528 --> 00:45:33.430
AS FAR AS GROWING THE PIPE HE

00:45:33.497 --> 00:45:34.665
WITH THE MINISTRATION BE OPENED

00:45:34.731 --> 00:45:36.133
ITS SETTING MORE.

ROBUST OUT YEAR TARGETS FOR L.

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:40.938
C. F. F. LIKE WE DID WITH THE

00:45:41.004 --> 00:45:41.705
FIRST ROUND.

00:45:41.772 --> 00:45:46.210
KIND OF LIKE AND AND ASPIRATE.

00:45:46.276 --> 00:45:47.911

THEIR WORDS FEW NOW THAT.

00:45:49.513 --> 00:45:51.181
LOWER EXPECTATIONS AS FAR AS

IMMERSING IT.

00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:56.386
I THINK GIVEN THAT THEIR WE

00:45:56.453 --> 00:45:57.588
HAVEN'T SEEN A YOU KNOW A

00:45:57.654 --> 00:45:59.356

POSITION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION --

00:46:03.527 --> 00:46:04.995
BUT CERTAINLY THAT CAN BE PART

I I I THINK THAT WE WOULD --

00:49:43.146 --> 00:49:44.481
CAUTION AGAINST ADOPTING THE

00:49:44.548 --> 00:49:46.049
SAME APPROACH THAT WAS TAKEN

LARGER EDUCATIONAL DEFICITS AND

00:50:04.434 --> 00:50:05.001
ADDRESSING THOSE DEFICITS WILL

00:50:05.068 --> 00:50:06.036
REQUIRE.

00:50:06.103 --> 00:50:08.271
MORE RESOURCES --

00:50:08.338 --> 00:50:11.541

00:52:48.732 --> 00:52:50.600
IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR ALL OF

00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:52.469
THEIR STUDENTS MATTER WHAT.

00:52:52.536 --> 00:52:52.969
THE BACKGROUND MIGHT BE

00:52:53.036 --> 00:52:53.270
[inaudible]

00:52:53.336 --> 00:52:54.971
ADDITIONALLY.

00:52:55.038 --> 00:52:56.072
BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE OF

00:52:56.139 --> 00:52:58.074
GENERAL FUND REVENUES IT IS

00:52:58.141 --> 00:52:59.809
UNLIKELY THAT SIGNIFICANT

00:52:59.876 --> 00:53:01.444
ADDITIONAL MONIES WILL BE

00:53:01.511 --> 00:53:02.946
AVAILABLE FOR THE LC A FAST AT

00:53:03.013 --> 00:53:04.548
THE MERE VISION BEYOND THE COST

00:53:04.614 --> 00:53:05.782
OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT.

00:53:05.849 --> 00:53:07.817
ON LIKE IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:53:07.884 --> 00:53:09.953
BUDGET ACT IN MORE RECENT YEARS

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.454
WHEN WE HAD A LARGE SURGES IN

00:53:11.521 --> 00:53:12.556
REVENUES --

00:53:12.622 --> 00:53:14.090
FROM GOING FROM THE GOVERNOR'S

00:53:14.157 --> 00:53:14.991
BUDGET TO THE MAYOR VISION

00:53:15.058 --> 00:53:16.326
TIMELINE --

00:53:16.393 --> 00:53:17.627
THAT IS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY

00:53:17.694 --> 00:53:19.462
REDUCING OTHER PARTS OF THE

00:53:19.529 --> 00:53:21.364
BUDGET TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE

00:53:21.431 --> 00:53:22.499
FUNDING.

00:53:22.566 --> 00:53:23.900
FIRST SCHOOLS --

00:53:23.967 --> 00:53:25.669
IN RECOGNITION.

00:53:25.735 --> 00:53:27.170
OF THIS REALITY.

00:53:27.237 --> 00:53:28.305
THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING

00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:30.640
TO TAKE AVAILABLE ONE TIME NON

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:32.375
PROPOSITION NINETY RESOURCES

00:53:32.442 --> 00:53:33.310
WITHIN THE BUDGET.

00:53:33.376 --> 00:53:35.579
AND APPLY THEM IN A WAY THAT WE

00:53:35.645 --> 00:53:37.113
FEEL WILL BE THE BEST.

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:38.348
BENEFITS.

00:53:38.415 --> 00:53:40.617
OVER A MULTI YEAR PERIOD FOR

00:53:40.684 --> 00:53:41.718
SCHOOLS.

00:53:41.785 --> 00:53:43.587
A SPECIFICALLY THE BUDGET IS

00:53:43.653 --> 00:53:44.788
PROPOSING LIKE I SAID A THREE

00:53:44.854 --> 00:53:46.156
BILLION DOLLAR --

00:53:46.222 --> 00:53:49.259
INFUSION OF MONIES INTO THE CAL

00:53:49.326 --> 00:53:51.061
HALF OF EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE

00:53:51.127 --> 00:53:52.529
RATE REALLY FOR THEM.

00:53:52.596 --> 00:53:54.531
APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED

00:53:54.598 --> 00:53:55.565
MILLION DOLLARS OF THIS WILL GO

00:53:55.632 --> 00:53:57.067
OUT OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS

00:53:57.133 --> 00:53:59.369
WHICH WILL EQUAL ROUGHLY THREE

00:53:59.436 --> 00:54:00.036
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN

00:54:00.103 --> 00:54:00.604
EACH YEAR --

00:54:00.670 --> 00:54:03.640
BEING NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY

00:54:03.707 --> 00:54:04.274
TWENTY ONE EFFECTIVELY REDUCING

00:54:04.341 --> 00:54:06.576
EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION RATES BY

00:54:06.643 --> 00:54:08.578
1% IN EACH YEAR --

00:54:08.645 --> 00:54:09.846
IN NINETEEN TWENTY TAKING

00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:12.616
EMPLOYERS FROM EIGHTEEN POINT 1%

00:54:12.682 --> 00:54:14.184
TO SEVENTEEN POINT 1%.

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:16.019
AND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TAKING

00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:17.654
THEM FROM NINETEEN POINT 1%

00:54:17.721 --> 00:54:19.522
CONTRIBUTION RATE TO EIGHTEEN

00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:21.524
POINT 1%.

00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:22.592
AFTER THAT THE REMAINING

00:54:22.659 --> 00:54:24.260
APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT THREE

00:54:24.327 --> 00:54:25.428
BILLION DOLLARS WILL GO TOWARDS

00:54:25.495 --> 00:54:27.063
PAYING DOWN THE LONG TERM

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:28.898
UNFUNDED LIABILITY.

00:54:28.965 --> 00:54:30.300
AND THAT IS ESTIMATED TO EQUAL

00:54:30.367 --> 00:54:33.036
POINT 5% REDUCTION IN EACH

00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:34.504
FUTURE YEAR FOR CONTRIBUTION

00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:37.741
RATES BEGINNING IN. TWENTY TWO

00:54:37.807 --> 00:54:38.241
TWENTY THREE FOR A TOTAL

00:54:38.308 --> 00:54:38.708
ESTIMATED SAVINGS OF

00:54:38.775 --> 00:54:40.543
APPROXIMATELY SIX POINT NINE

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:43.279
BILLION THROUGH TWENTY FORTY SIX

00:54:43.346 --> 00:54:44.748
THE LIFE OF THE CURRENT CASTERS

00:54:44.814 --> 00:54:46.116
FUNDING PLAN --

00:54:46.182 --> 00:54:47.083
WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE MY

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:48.952
COMMENTS BUT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER

00:54:49.019 --> 00:54:51.287
QUESTIONS.

00:54:51.354 --> 00:54:52.122
OKAY.

00:54:52.188 --> 00:54:53.456
THANK YOU LA L..

00:54:53.523 --> 00:54:54.024
THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING

00:54:54.090 --> 00:54:55.659
MISTER CHAIR KENNETH COUPON WITH

00:54:55.725 --> 00:54:57.227
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE.

00:54:57.293 --> 00:54:58.495
WE HAVE A HAND OUT THAT --

00:54:58.561 --> 00:54:59.929
AND I WON'T COVER ALL OF THE

00:54:59.996 --> 00:55:01.131
BACK ON IN THE HEARTS BUT

00:55:01.197 --> 00:55:03.199
TURNING TO PAGE TWO AND KIND OF

00:55:03.266 --> 00:55:04.000
BY WAY OF BACKGROUND.

00:55:04.067 --> 00:55:05.201
IS ONE OF THE TOUCH BRIEFLY ON

00:55:05.268 --> 00:55:06.636
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE

00:55:06.703 --> 00:55:08.405
CHARACTERS FUNDING PLAN STATE

00:55:08.471 --> 00:55:09.739
ADOPTED IN.

00:55:09.806 --> 00:55:10.373
TWENTY FOURTEEN AS YOU PROBABLY

00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:10.974
KNOW --

00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:15.211
CONTRIBUTIONS TO CHARACTERS FROM

00:55:15.278 --> 00:55:16.613
STATES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.314
I HAVE NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT TO

00:55:18.381 --> 00:55:19.582
PAY FOR BENEFITS AS TEACHERS

00:55:19.649 --> 00:55:20.950
HAVE EARNED THEM FOR MOST OF

00:55:21.017 --> 00:55:22.318
CHARACTERS HISTORY.

00:55:22.385 --> 00:55:23.920
AND BY THE EARLY TWENTY TENS

00:55:23.987 --> 00:55:24.621
THAT.

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:25.689
UNDER FUNDING HAD REACHED A

00:55:25.755 --> 00:55:27.557
CRITICAL POINT WITH THE SYSTEM

00:55:27.624 --> 00:55:30.460
PROJECTED TO RUN OUT OF ASSETS

00:55:30.527 --> 00:55:32.729
BY THE MID TWENTY FORTY IS --

00:55:32.796 --> 00:55:34.030
AND THE LEGISLATURE --

00:55:34.097 --> 00:55:35.131
SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING

00:55:35.198 --> 00:55:37.133
ABOUT THAT ISSUE HAD A LOT OF

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:38.368
HEARINGS TALKED ABOUT.

00:55:38.435 --> 00:55:40.203
SOME OF THE PRINCIPLES FOR

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:42.372
ADDRESSING THAT SHORTFALL SHARED

00:55:42.439 --> 00:55:43.807
RESPONSIBILITY.

00:55:43.873 --> 00:55:45.341
I'M NOT LOTS OF DISCUSSION.

00:55:45.408 --> 00:55:48.011
AND THAT ULTIMATELY LED TO THIS.

00:55:48.078 --> 00:55:49.579
PLAN THAT WAS INTENDED TO

00:55:49.646 --> 00:55:50.480
ELIMINATE THE UNFUNDED

00:55:50.547 --> 00:55:52.082
LIABILITIES BY THE MID TWENTY

00:55:52.148 --> 00:55:52.816
FORTY IS.

00:55:52.882 --> 00:55:54.451
I THINK THE FIGURE ON PAGE TWO

00:55:54.517 --> 00:55:55.852
REALLY ILLUSTRATES HOW

00:55:55.919 --> 00:55:58.221
SIGNIFICANT THAT PLAN WAS.

00:55:58.288 --> 00:55:59.889
IN MOVING CAL STIRS FROM

00:55:59.956 --> 00:56:01.524
INTRODUCTORY WHERE IT WAS.

00:56:01.591 --> 00:56:03.293
GOING TO RUN OUT OF FUNDING

00:56:03.359 --> 00:56:04.961
WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE DECADES

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:06.429
TO INTRODUCTORY WHERE IT COULD

00:56:06.496 --> 00:56:09.165
ACHIEVE FULL FUNDING.

00:56:09.232 --> 00:56:11.267
BY THE MID TWENTY FORTY IS --

00:56:11.334 --> 00:56:14.637
TURNING TO PAGE THREE AS YOU.

00:56:14.704 --> 00:56:16.339
I HEARD OF THE THE PLAN REALLY

00:56:16.406 --> 00:56:17.373
IS.

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:18.775
A THIRTY YEAR PLAN AND SO

00:56:18.842 --> 00:56:21.111
PERHAPS NOT SURPRISINGLY BEING

00:56:21.177 --> 00:56:22.479
ONLY FIVE YEARS INTO IT.

00:56:22.545 --> 00:56:24.581
THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY TODAY IS

00:56:24.647 --> 00:56:26.883
IT IS STILL LARGE IT'S OVER A

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:28.785
HUNDRED BILLION --

00:56:28.852 --> 00:56:29.385
AT AS OF THIS POINT THE PLANET

00:56:29.452 --> 00:56:33.523
SO SIX ABOUT ONE THIRD TO THE

00:56:33.590 --> 00:56:34.524
STATE THE SIX CHAIRS AND KIND OF

00:56:34.591 --> 00:56:36.059
FLUCTUATE OVER TIME --

00:56:36.126 --> 00:56:38.394
BUT IT'S STILL YOU KNOW IT'S

00:56:38.461 --> 00:56:38.928
STILL A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

00:56:38.995 --> 00:56:41.131
CHALLENGE --

00:56:41.197 --> 00:56:42.132
I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION

00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:43.867
BETWEEN THE PAGE FOR GIVE YOU A

00:56:43.933 --> 00:56:45.468
GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT.

00:56:45.535 --> 00:56:46.703
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH RATES AND

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:48.738
COSTS LATELY I DISTRICT COST

00:56:48.805 --> 00:56:50.206
SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE PLAN

00:56:50.273 --> 00:56:52.008
HAVE GROWN A LITTLE OVER THREE

00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:55.378
BILLION DOLLARS FROM TWO

00:56:55.445 --> 00:56:55.912
THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN

00:56:55.979 --> 00:56:57.347
THROUGH.

00:56:57.413 --> 00:56:57.914
TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE

00:56:57.981 --> 00:56:58.782
ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES THE

00:56:58.848 --> 00:57:00.316
ADDITIONAL INCREASE OVER THE

00:57:00.383 --> 00:57:02.118
NEXT TWO YEARS WILL BE ABOUT ONE

00:57:02.185 --> 00:57:03.453
POINT FOUR BILLION --

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:04.554
THAT'S FAIRLY CLOSE TO OUR OWN

00:57:04.621 --> 00:57:07.257
ESTIMATES OF HOW MUCH DISTRICT

00:57:07.323 --> 00:57:09.759
COSTS WOULD INCREASE --

00:57:09.826 --> 00:57:10.693
ONE SORT OF AN IMPORTANT POINT I

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.228
MEANT MIGHT MENTION IS THAT EVEN

00:57:12.295 --> 00:57:14.330
THOUGH ALL EMPLOYERS ARE PAYING

00:57:14.397 --> 00:57:15.765
THE SAME RATE THE COST TO VARY A

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:17.333
LITTLE BIT AROUND THE STATE FROM

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.401
DISTRICT TO DISTRICT.

00:57:18.468 --> 00:57:19.602
BECAUSE DISTRICTS MAKE DIFFERENT

00:57:19.669 --> 00:57:21.070
DECISIONS ABOUT THE LOCAL PAPER

00:57:21.137 --> 00:57:21.938
ALL.

00:57:22.005 --> 00:57:23.540
DISTRICTS SOME DISTRICTS HAVE

00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:24.974
BEEN GRANTING LARGER OR SMALLER

00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:26.609
SALARY INCREASES SOME OF AN

00:57:26.676 --> 00:57:28.178
INCREASING SALARY MORE OR LESS

00:57:28.244 --> 00:57:29.412
THAN OTHER DISTRICTS.

00:57:29.479 --> 00:57:31.080
AND SO THOSE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE

00:57:31.147 --> 00:57:32.248
HAD THEIR PAYROLL GROW MORE

00:57:32.315 --> 00:57:35.051
QUICKLY HAVE ALSO SEEN A PENSION

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:37.487
COSTS GO MORE QUICKLY.

00:57:37.554 --> 00:57:38.855
I'M PAGE FIVE I THINK THE

00:57:38.922 --> 00:57:40.423
ADMINISTRATION I GIVE YOU A GOOD

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:41.858
OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSAL.

00:57:41.925 --> 00:57:43.126
I THINK.

00:57:43.193 --> 00:57:44.661
ONE POINT WE MIGHT EMPHASIZES

00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:45.995
THAT ALTHOUGH.

00:57:46.062 --> 00:57:47.263
THE TWO PROPOSALS ARE VERY EASY

00:57:47.330 --> 00:57:49.432
TO LUMP TOGETHER THE OBJECTIVES

00:57:49.499 --> 00:57:50.834
FOR EACH REALLY.

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:52.569
QUITE DIFFERENT THE SEVEN

00:57:52.635 --> 00:57:54.037
HUNDRED MILLION REALLY IS ALL

00:57:54.103 --> 00:57:56.506
ABOUT DISTRICT BUDGET RELIEF --

00:57:56.573 --> 00:57:57.040
KIND OF BY DESIGN IT'S NOT

00:57:57.106 --> 00:57:59.809
INTENDED AND IF MAKE MORE OR

00:57:59.876 --> 00:58:02.345
LESS PROGRESS TOWARDS A PAYING

00:58:02.412 --> 00:58:03.546
DOWN THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY.

00:58:03.613 --> 00:58:05.081
OF THE TWO POINT THREE BILLION

00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:06.649
THOUGH THAT REALLY IS ABOUT THE

00:58:06.716 --> 00:58:07.784
UNFUNDED LIABILITY.

00:58:07.851 --> 00:58:09.452
IT LETS THE STATE TAKE ANOTHER

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:11.321
STEP TOWARDS FULL FUNDING OF THE

00:58:11.387 --> 00:58:12.322
PLAN.

00:58:12.388 --> 00:58:14.057
AND IT DOES HAVE THE POTENTIAL

00:58:14.123 --> 00:58:16.693
TO REDUCE RATES DISTRICT RATES

00:58:16.759 --> 00:58:18.561
STARTING IN.

00:58:18.628 --> 00:58:19.362
TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUT THE

00:58:19.429 --> 00:58:20.230
LIGHT THE LIGHT MOST OF THOSE

00:58:20.296 --> 00:58:21.531
SAVINGS ARE REALLY IN THE LONG

00:58:21.598 --> 00:58:22.932
TERM IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT SORT

00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:24.000
OF IMMEDIATE.

00:58:24.067 --> 00:58:26.970
BUDGET RELIEF UNLIKE THE SEVEN

00:58:27.036 --> 00:58:30.073
HUNDRED MILLION.

00:58:30.139 --> 00:58:31.107
SO TURNING TO PAGE SIX I THINK

00:58:31.174 --> 00:58:32.408
ONE OF THE REASONS THAT

00:58:32.475 --> 00:58:34.244
CHARACTERS HAS BEEN THIS SORT OF

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:36.212
DIFFICULT CONVERSATION FOR YOU

00:58:36.279 --> 00:58:37.680
THE PAST COUPLE YEARS.

00:58:37.747 --> 00:58:39.215
THAT THE DISTRICT RATE IS

00:58:39.282 --> 00:58:40.617
ALREADY OUT ABOUT 16% THAT'S

00:58:40.683 --> 00:58:42.118
MORE THAN DOUBLE WHERE IT WAS

00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:44.487
BEFORE THE START OF THE

00:58:44.554 --> 00:58:45.855
HEALTHCARE SPENDING PLAN.

00:58:45.922 --> 00:58:48.291
THAT BUT DESPITE THAT INCREASE --

00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:49.826
THE DISTRICT RATE STILL.

00:58:49.893 --> 00:58:51.127
ISN'T HIGH ENOUGH AT THIS POINT

00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:52.395
TO ACHIEVE THE FULL FUNDING

00:58:52.462 --> 00:58:54.230
OBJECTIVES THAT YOU SET FORTH

00:58:54.297 --> 00:58:55.431
THE SPENDING PLAN.

00:58:55.498 --> 00:58:56.966
AND SO I THINK THE QUESTION THAT

00:58:57.033 --> 00:58:58.268
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL PUTS

00:58:58.334 --> 00:59:00.770
BEFORE YOU ISN'T SO MUCH ABOUT

00:59:00.837 --> 00:59:02.772
WHETHER THE DISTRICT GREAT --

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:05.141
SHOULD GO UP OR NOT BUT WINDOW

00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:06.476
WHAT THE TIMING OF THAT INCREASE

00:59:06.542 --> 00:59:07.844
SHOULD BE AND WHEN THOSE

00:59:07.911 --> 00:59:09.545
INCREASES SHOULD OCCUR.

00:59:09.612 --> 00:59:12.048
DISTRICTS ARE LIKELY TO SEE RATE

00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:13.383
INCREASES AS CHALLENGING IN

00:59:13.449 --> 00:59:14.918
VIRTUALLY ANY FISCAL ENVIRONMENT

00:59:14.984 --> 00:59:16.319
WE CAN IMAGINE.

00:59:16.386 --> 00:59:17.720
BUT AS YOU THINK ABOUT THAT

00:59:17.787 --> 00:59:19.355
QUESTION THE STATE RIGHT NOW IS

00:59:19.422 --> 00:59:20.990
IN THE MIDST OF A OF A VERY

00:59:21.057 --> 00:59:22.058
STRONG ECONOMIC TIES IN THIS

00:59:22.125 --> 00:59:23.760
SCHOOL FUNDING HAS GROWN TWENTY

00:59:23.826 --> 00:59:27.130
TWO BILLION THE PAST --

00:59:27.196 --> 00:59:27.931
SIX YEAR IS THE GOVERNMENT'S

00:59:27.997 --> 00:59:29.399
PROPOSED ANOTHER TWO POINT NINE

00:59:29.465 --> 00:59:30.767
BILLION INCREASE FOR K. TWELVE

00:59:30.833 --> 00:59:33.636
EDUCATION ON A PER PUPIL BASIS

00:59:33.703 --> 00:59:35.471
FUNDING IS AT AN ALL TIME HIGH.

00:59:35.538 --> 00:59:37.373
AND SO AN ALTERNATIVE WE WANT TO

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:39.709
SKETCH OUT IS TO SET ASIDE THAT

00:59:39.776 --> 00:59:41.377
SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION NOW FOR

00:59:41.444 --> 00:59:43.413
RELIEF BUT NOT IMMEDIATELY USE

00:59:43.479 --> 00:59:44.347
THAT TO LOWER DISTRICT

00:59:44.414 --> 00:59:45.648
CONTRIBUTION RATES.

00:59:45.715 --> 00:59:47.483
OF THE STATE WOULD INSTEAD LEAVE

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:48.885
THE RATES --

00:59:48.952 --> 00:59:50.653
AS INCREASES THAT ARE SCHEDULED

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.422
TO OCCUR NOW --

00:59:52.488 --> 00:59:53.323
BUT USE THAT --

00:59:53.389 --> 00:59:55.091
SORT OF SATISFIED THAT SEVEN

00:59:55.158 --> 00:59:56.025
HUNDRED MILLION.

00:59:56.092 --> 00:59:57.860
FOR RELIEF DURING THE NEXT

00:59:57.927 --> 00:59:59.162
DOWNTURN TO THE NEXT RECESSION.

00:59:59.228 --> 01:00:00.430
AND THAT MIGHT HELP DISTRICTS

01:00:00.496 --> 01:00:02.832
AVOID THE REALLY TO STRING AN

01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:04.267
EXTRA NEXT DURING THE NEXT

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:05.735
RECESSION WHEN THEY MIGHT BE

01:00:05.802 --> 01:00:08.438
FACING THE PROSPECT OF FLAT TO

01:00:08.504 --> 01:00:10.306
MAYBE DECLINING FUNDING AT THE

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:12.075
SAME TIME THAT COULD BE PRESSURE

01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:12.608
FOR THE RATES TO CONTINUE

01:00:12.675 --> 01:00:14.043
INCREASING.

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.278
THIS ALTERNATIVE WOULD HELP KIND

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:17.547
OF MITIGATE THAT THAT REALLY

01:00:17.613 --> 01:00:21.050
DIFFICULT COMBINATION.

01:00:21.117 --> 01:00:21.684
THAT'S A FINALLY TRAINING TO BE

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:24.921
A RESERVE JUST FOR POP WENT LIKE

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:26.055
PROBABLY NEED RESERVE.

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:26.689
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND YOU

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:27.824
HAD VARIOUS WAYS YOU COULD

01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:28.958
STRUCTURE IT YOU COULD JUST PUT

01:00:29.025 --> 01:00:31.227
IT ASIDE AND JUST A RESERVE.

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:32.962
FOR I'M GONNA FUTURE PENSION

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:36.199
COSTS THAT WOULD BE KIND OF WITH.

01:00:36.265 --> 01:00:36.766
IN A SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:38.901
OTHER RESERVE SIR YOU CREATED A

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:40.536
YOU COULD ALSO EXPLORE --

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:41.838
PERHAPS GIVING.

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:43.072
THE MONEY TO CAL STAR IS AND

01:00:43.139 --> 01:00:45.241
LETTING THEM INVESTED IN SOME

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:48.044
WAY BUT DIRECTING THEM NOT TO

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:49.278
IMMEDIATELY REDUCED RATES BUT TO

01:00:49.345 --> 01:00:50.913
REDUCE RATES AT SOME POINT IN

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:51.748
THE FUTURE.

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:52.648
IT'S KIND OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:54.017
STRUCTURE AT AND WE CAN IF

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:55.218
YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT OPTION

01:00:55.284 --> 01:00:59.722
WE CAN HELP YOU THINK THROUGH.

01:00:59.789 --> 01:01:01.891
A THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT.

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:03.559
SO TURNING TO THE TWO POINT

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:04.794
THREE BILLION --

01:01:04.861 --> 01:01:05.361
YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT --

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:06.295
DEBTS AND LIABILITIES AND

01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:07.363
HEARINGS ALREADY THIS YEAR AND

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:08.331
WE'VE WRITTEN A WHOLE REPORT

01:01:08.398 --> 01:01:10.033
ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SO

01:01:10.099 --> 01:01:11.968
I WON'T BELABOR OUR ASSESSMENT

01:01:12.035 --> 01:01:13.069
OF IT.

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:14.937
BUT JUST IN BRIEF WE THINK THE

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:17.507
STATE DOES HAVE A BIGGER IN SUCH

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:18.775
A LARGE SURPLUS.

01:01:18.841 --> 01:01:20.009
AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:21.344
OPPORTUNITY TO PAY DOWN

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:24.247
LIABILITIES SEEMS PRUDENT TO US.

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:26.015
AT FIFTY SAVINGS I SIGNIFICANT

01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:27.750
WITH THOSE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:29.185
THAT YOU MAKE TODAY.

01:01:29.252 --> 01:01:30.887
UP FOR THE SPECIFIC DOLLAR

01:01:30.953 --> 01:01:32.221
AMOUNT THE TWO POINT THREE

01:01:32.288 --> 01:01:33.623
BILLION ON BEHALF OF DISTRICTS I

01:01:33.689 --> 01:01:35.191
THINK YOUR DECISION ABOUT THAT

01:01:35.258 --> 01:01:36.759
WERE REALLY DEPEND ON KIND OF

01:01:36.826 --> 01:01:39.295
YOUR WILLINGNESS TO TAKE ON SOME

01:01:39.362 --> 01:01:41.531
ADDITIONAL SHARE OF DISTRICT

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:42.565
LIABILITIES.

01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:45.301
WHEN THE STATE CONTINUES TO HAVE

01:01:45.368 --> 01:01:47.403
SOME OF ITS OWN LARGE UNFUNDED

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:48.971
LIABILITY IS?

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:50.406
BY THE STATE THAT HAS ALREADY

01:01:50.473 --> 01:01:51.774
TAKEN ON A PRETTY LARGE SHARE OF

01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:53.943
THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY AND CAL

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:55.411
STAR IS --

01:01:55.478 --> 01:01:56.679
THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE YOUR FROM

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:58.181
THAT THE GOVERNOR WOULD HAVE A

01:01:58.247 --> 01:01:59.348
TAKE ON A BIT MORE.

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:01.050
AND SO THAT'S JUST KIND OF

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:01.818
SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO THINK

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:03.252
ABOUT IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL OF

01:02:03.319 --> 01:02:04.720
THE OTHER DEBTS AND LIABILITIES

01:02:04.787 --> 01:02:05.922
THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT.

01:02:05.988 --> 01:02:07.723
AFTER THE STATE --

01:02:07.790 --> 01:02:09.759
AND ITS OWN EMPLOYEES.

01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:10.860
SO WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO

01:02:10.927 --> 01:02:16.599
TAKE ANY QUESTIONS.

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:19.068
I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:20.503
THAT ARE YES THE WHAT THE ONE

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.138
SPECIFIC QUESTION.

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:24.373
AND CUT A LONELY UP HERE TODAY

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:27.043
SO.

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:32.081
MAYES GOING FAST --

01:02:32.148 --> 01:02:32.982
YEAH.

01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:34.016
SO OF COURSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:37.487
ARE STIRS AND AND PURRS AND SO I

01:02:37.553 --> 01:02:41.958
ASSUME PER IS ARE THE CLASSIFIED.

01:02:42.024 --> 01:02:44.060
STAFF AND SOME ADMIN.

01:02:44.127 --> 01:02:45.962
AND SO WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THE

01:02:46.028 --> 01:02:48.331
WITH THIS IS FOCUSED OF COURSE

01:02:48.397 --> 01:02:50.266
ON STIRS AND WE DON'T TAKE A

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:52.001
LOOK AT THE PERS ISSUES FOR THE

01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:54.237
DISTRICTS.

01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:55.471
SURE SO YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT

01:02:55.538 --> 01:02:56.672
ABOUT THE EMPLOYEE'S SO CAL

01:02:56.739 --> 01:02:59.308
STIRS AS ADMINISTERING BENEFITS

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:00.943
FOR OUR TEACHER IS --

01:03:01.010 --> 01:03:02.278
COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY KIND

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:03.513
OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE A EMPLOYEES

01:03:03.579 --> 01:03:05.548
RUSTIC CREDENTIALS CALPERS IS

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:06.983
ADMINISTERING BENEFITS FOR

01:03:07.049 --> 01:03:08.351
EVERYONE ELSE.

01:03:08.417 --> 01:03:09.352
BY THE STATE GONNA FOR

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:10.653
HISTORICAL REASONS HAS ALWAYS

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.054
HAD A LITTLE BIT OF A TATER

01:03:12.121 --> 01:03:13.956
RELATIONSHIP WITH CHARACTERS.

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:14.891
IT'S KIND OF UNIQUE IN ITS THAT

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:17.160
I THINK THE ONLY PENSION SYSTEM

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:17.793
WE CAN THINK OF WHERE THE STATE

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:19.395
IS MAKING A REALLY LARGE

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:20.930
CONTRIBUTION.

01:03:20.997 --> 01:03:22.365
ON BEHALF OF LOCAL EMPLOYEES IT

01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:24.200
DOESN'T HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:25.968
WITH -- SAY

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:28.070
CITIES ARE COUNTY IS OR EVEN --

01:03:28.137 --> 01:03:31.541
CALPERS --

01:03:31.607 --> 01:03:32.141
SCHOOL PAUL THAT SERVE SCHOOLS

01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:35.711
AND COMMITTEE CALL A PROPOSAL WE

01:03:35.778 --> 01:03:37.113
ANALYZED --

01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:39.749
AS FAR AS HOW THE STATE MIGHT

01:03:39.815 --> 01:03:41.884
MAKE IT AN ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS --

01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:43.619
YOU KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING

01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:46.122
YOU'RE INTERESTED WE COULD.

01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:47.256
CERTAINLY TAKE THAT BACK AND

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:49.292
THINK ABOUT IT BUT NOW AT THIS

01:03:49.358 --> 01:03:49.892
POINT THERE JUST WASN'T THE

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:51.561
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON CALPERS I

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:53.496
GUESS THE QUESTION WAS SOMEWHAT

01:03:53.563 --> 01:03:56.465
DIRECTED TO THE ADMINISTRATION --

01:03:56.532 --> 01:03:57.667
AS YOU SEE ME IN THE AGENDA.

01:03:57.733 --> 01:03:59.168
WHAT WAS THAT THOUGHT PROCESS OF

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:02.838
NOT DOING THIS? FOR CALPERS

01:04:02.905 --> 01:04:03.839
RIGHT.

01:04:03.906 --> 01:04:05.508
I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:06.943
THOUGHT PROCESS THE INTENT

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:08.978
BEHIND THE PROPOSAL --

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:10.513
AS I MENTIONED AS THE LA --

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:12.014
POINT OUT REALLY WAS IN THE

01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:13.716
SHORT TERM WE WANTED TO BE ABLE

01:04:13.783 --> 01:04:14.984
TO PROVIDE SOME IMMEDIATE RELIEF

01:04:15.051 --> 01:04:20.022
SOME IMMEDIATE RATE RELIEF AS

01:04:20.089 --> 01:04:20.656
UNDER THE COUNTER SPENDING PLAN

01:04:20.723 --> 01:04:23.526
RATES OF SEE IT JUST LOOKING AT

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:25.094
THE AT THE PLAN.

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:26.796
COM AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:04:26.862 --> 01:04:27.830
WRITE SOME SHORT TERM RELIEF

01:04:27.897 --> 01:04:28.998
WHILE ALSO BEING ABLE TO

01:04:29.065 --> 01:04:30.700
PRIORITIZE SOME LONG TERM

01:04:30.766 --> 01:04:32.435
SAVINGS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FOR

01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:34.437
THEM BY PARTISAN THAT REMAINING

01:04:34.503 --> 01:04:35.638
TWO POINT THREE BILLION.

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:37.139
I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE

01:04:37.206 --> 01:04:38.874
CAL STAR SIDE IT'S JUST SO MUCH

01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:40.943
LARGER THE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:42.345
ON THE CAL STAR SIDE IS

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:44.080
ESTIMATED AS OF EIGHTEEN

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:45.181
NINETEEN IF I RECALL CORRECTLY

01:04:45.248 --> 01:04:45.781
TO BE.

01:04:45.848 --> 01:04:47.116
A JUST OVER SEVENTY ONE BILLION

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:48.584
DOLLARS WHILE THE CALPERS SITE

01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:49.685
IS -- JUST

01:04:49.752 --> 01:04:50.519
ABOUT TWENTY THREE AND A HALF

01:04:50.586 --> 01:04:52.154
BILLION SO THERE'S THAT

01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:53.322
DISPARITY THAT THE CONCERT'S

01:04:53.389 --> 01:04:54.824
PEACHES MAKES UP SUCH A LARGE

01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:56.826
SHARE -- AND

01:04:56.892 --> 01:04:57.560
I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:04:57.627 --> 01:04:58.761
CUSTER'S COULD PROBABLY HELP ME

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:17.025
UPDATED THEIR LOCAL COMPANY PLAN

01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:20.728
TEMPLATE TWICE SINCE TWENTY FOUR

01:28:20.795 --> 01:28:21.996
SINCE JANUARY OF TWENTY FOURTEEN

01:28:22.063 --> 01:28:22.930
BUT THE MOST RECENT CHANGE HAD

01:28:22.997 --> 01:28:24.032
TO REALLY IMPORTANT CHANGES

01:28:24.098 --> 01:28:25.733
FOCUSED ON TRANSPARENCY IN

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.402
PARTICULAR ABOUT THE INFORMATION

01:28:27.468 --> 01:28:28.703
IN THE EL CAP IN THE

01:28:28.770 --> 01:28:30.371
EXPENDITURES REFLECTED THEIR THE

01:28:30.438 --> 01:28:31.205
FIRST IT.

01:28:31.272 --> 01:28:32.607
WAS A BUDGET SUMMARY THAT REALLY

01:28:32.674 --> 01:28:34.075
JUST A HIGH LEVEL OR SORRY A

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:35.209
PLAN SUMMARY THAT WAS A HIGH

01:28:35.276 --> 01:28:36.878
LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF SIR WHAT'S

01:28:36.944 --> 01:28:38.246
THE KEY TAKE AWAYS.

01:28:38.312 --> 01:28:39.380
OF THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY

01:28:39.447 --> 01:28:40.782
PLANNED THAT THE DISTRICT HAS

01:28:40.848 --> 01:28:43.484
ADOPTED IN ALSO CLARIFYING THAT

01:28:43.551 --> 01:28:44.919
THE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL ACTUALLY

01:28:44.986 --> 01:28:47.388
HAS TO IDENTIFY EACH ACTION IN

01:28:47.455 --> 01:28:49.190
THE EL CAP THATIS CONTRIBUTING

01:28:49.257 --> 01:28:50.625
TO ITS OBLIGATIONTO INCREASE

01:28:50.692 --> 01:28:52.527
IMPROVE SERVICES. FOR THE THREE

01:28:52.593 --> 01:28:53.695
HIGH NEED STUDENT GROUPS THAT

01:28:53.761 --> 01:28:56.330
RECEIVE ADDITIONAL FUNDS UNDER

01:28:56.397 --> 01:28:57.799
L. CFF.

01:28:57.865 --> 01:28:58.633
AS THE AGENDA MATERIALS NOTED

01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:00.735
LAST YEAR'S BUDGET ACT INCLUDED

01:29:00.802 --> 01:29:03.771
TWO KEY CHANGES ONE IS A NEW

01:29:03.838 --> 01:29:06.107
DOCUMENT THAT'S REQUIRED TO BE

01:29:06.174 --> 01:29:08.309
ADOPTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH

01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:09.711
LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY COULD PLAN.

01:29:09.777 --> 01:29:10.611
THAT IS A BUDGET SUMMARY FOR

01:29:10.678 --> 01:29:12.413
PARENTS AND AGAIN THE GOAL OF

01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:13.448
THAT DOCUMENT SPREAD GREATER

01:29:13.514 --> 01:29:15.216
TRANSPARENCY AROUND THE

01:29:15.283 --> 01:29:16.617
DISTRICTS OVERALL REVENUES AND

01:29:16.684 --> 01:29:17.719
EXPENDITURES.

01:29:17.785 --> 01:29:19.087
AS WELL AS HOW THOSE RELATE TO

01:29:19.153 --> 01:29:20.088
WHAT WE SEE AND LOCAL

01:29:20.154 --> 01:29:21.489
ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN THAT IT'S

01:29:21.556 --> 01:29:22.490
ADOPTED.

01:29:22.557 --> 01:29:23.858
AND ITS REQUIREMENT TO INCREASE

01:29:23.925 --> 01:29:25.493
IMPROVE SERVICES HOW THE

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.095
EXPENDITURES IN THE EL CAP

01:29:27.161 --> 01:29:28.496
REALLY MEET THAT OBLIGATION.

01:29:28.563 --> 01:29:29.764
AND THE SECOND PIECE WHICH THE

01:29:29.831 --> 01:29:30.732
BOARD WILL BE WORKING ON THIS

01:29:30.798 --> 01:29:33.000
YEAR IS A REQUIREMENT TO UPDATE

01:29:33.067 --> 01:29:34.502
THE LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN.

01:29:34.569 --> 01:29:36.437
TEMPLATE TO INCLUDE SUMMARY

01:29:36.504 --> 01:29:39.941
TABLES THE ENTIRE LOCAL

01:29:40.007 --> 01:29:41.309
ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN ALL THE

01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:43.711
EXPENDITURES INCLUDED AND ALSO

01:29:43.778 --> 01:29:44.512
FOR THOSE ACTIONS THAT

01:29:44.579 --> 01:29:45.613
CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR APARTMENT TO

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:46.881
INCREASE IMPROVE SERVICES FOR

01:29:46.948 --> 01:29:48.049
HIGH NEED STUDENTS.

01:29:48.116 --> 01:29:49.150
SO THE GOAL THERE IS TO JUST

01:29:49.217 --> 01:29:51.018
MAKE IT IS AS EASY AS POSSIBLE

01:29:51.085 --> 01:29:52.820
FOR PARENTS IN THE COMMUNITY TO

01:29:52.887 --> 01:29:54.255
UNDERSTAND HOW THE DISTRICT IS

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:56.491
PRIORITIZING ITS RESOURCES.

01:29:56.557 --> 01:29:58.226
THAT THEY CAN ENGAGE AND THE

01:29:58.292 --> 01:30:00.628
LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS.

01:30:00.695 --> 01:30:02.330
SO THAT ADDITIONAL CHANGE AT THE

01:30:02.396 --> 01:30:03.531
BOARD MEETING THEM IN THE

01:30:03.598 --> 01:30:04.398
CURRENT TEMP --

01:30:04.465 --> 01:30:06.634
EL CAP TEMPLATE IS TO ADD

01:30:06.701 --> 01:30:08.870
PROBLEMS IN THE SUMMARY OF THE

01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:11.005
EL CAP THAT REQUIRED THE ALLEY A

01:30:11.072 --> 01:30:13.007
TO ADDRESS ANY AREAS ON THE

01:30:13.074 --> 01:30:14.375
DASHBOARD WHERE THERE'S LOW

01:30:14.442 --> 01:30:16.043
PERFORMANCE OR WHERE THERE AREAS

01:30:16.110 --> 01:30:17.011
WHERE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT

01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:18.746
DISPARITIES IN PERFORMANCE AMONG

01:30:18.813 --> 01:30:19.413
STUDENT GROUPS.

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:21.115
SECOND OF ALL THERE WAS TO BUILD

01:30:21.182 --> 01:30:23.284
OUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

01:30:23.351 --> 01:30:25.520
DASHBOARD INDIA AND THAT LOCAL

01:30:25.586 --> 01:30:27.088
ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN SET THE

01:30:27.155 --> 01:30:29.323
STATE PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:29.891
PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO THE

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:30.792
STANDARDS.

01:30:30.858 --> 01:30:32.260
IS A KEY ASPECT OF THE

01:30:32.326 --> 01:30:33.928
CONVERSATION LOCALLY ABOUT HOW

01:30:33.995 --> 01:30:35.696
TO PRIORITIZE AND FOCUS WITHIN

01:30:35.763 --> 01:30:37.165
THEIR LOCAL PLANNING PROCESS.

01:30:37.231 --> 01:30:38.466
AND SIGNIFICANTLY REALLY

01:30:38.533 --> 01:30:40.501
ENSURING THAT IF THERE ARE

01:30:40.568 --> 01:30:41.903
DISPARITIES IN PERFORMANCE AMONG

01:30:41.969 --> 01:30:43.504
STUDENT GROUPS THE LOCAL

01:30:43.571 --> 01:30:44.839
EDUCATIONAL UNITS WE MUST

01:30:44.906 --> 01:30:45.773
ADDRESS THAT WITHIN LOCAL

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:47.608
PLANNING PROCESS AND ENGAGE WITH

01:30:47.675 --> 01:30:50.711
THEIR STAKEHOLDERS AROUND THAT

01:30:50.778 --> 01:30:51.712
CONVERSATION.

01:30:51.779 --> 01:30:52.313
SO I THINK TO CONCLUDE WHAT I

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:53.181
WOULD NOTE IS THAT WHERE WE ARE

01:30:53.247 --> 01:30:55.449
NOW WITH THE EXISTENCE OF THE

01:30:55.516 --> 01:30:57.819
DASHBOARD THE UPDATED LOCAL

01:30:57.885 --> 01:30:59.220
ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN TEMPLATE.

01:30:59.287 --> 01:31:00.788
IS SORT OF WHERE THE LOCAL

01:31:00.855 --> 01:31:02.623
PLANNING PROCESS IS ABLE TO WORK

01:31:02.690 --> 01:31:04.292
AS IT WAS ALWAYS INTENDED WHERE

01:31:04.358 --> 01:31:05.893
WE HAVE LOCALLY AVAILABLE

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:07.795
INFORMATION BUT ALSO THOSE STATE

01:31:07.862 --> 01:31:08.863
MEASURES.

01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:09.764
THAT ARE REPORTED AGAINST

01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:11.365
CONSISTENT PERFORMANCE STANDARDS

01:31:11.432 --> 01:31:12.266
STATEWIDE AND REALLY HELP

01:31:12.333 --> 01:31:13.467
FOCUSING GUIDE LOCAL

01:31:13.534 --> 01:31:15.269
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHETHER WHAT

01:31:15.336 --> 01:31:17.004
THE DISTRICT IS PROPOSING TO DO

01:31:17.071 --> 01:31:18.306
AND HOW TO USING ITS FUNDS IT'S

01:31:18.372 --> 01:31:19.907
FUNDS IS REALLY WORKING. FOR

01:31:19.974 --> 01:31:20.975
STUDENTS TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND

01:31:21.042 --> 01:31:22.844
OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL STUDENTS

01:31:22.910 --> 01:31:24.478
IN PARTICULAR THE HIGH NEED

01:31:24.545 --> 01:31:26.080
STUDENT GROUPS THAT THEY SERVE.

01:31:26.147 --> 01:31:26.848
I THINK THAT THE FURTHER

01:31:26.914 --> 01:31:28.249
IMPROVEMENTS TO TRANSPARENCY

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:29.517
THAT THE NEXT LOCAL

01:31:29.584 --> 01:31:30.618
ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN TEMPLATE

01:31:30.685 --> 01:31:31.886
WILL INCLUDE AROUND THERE'S

01:31:31.953 --> 01:31:33.921
EXPENDITURES WILL JUST FURTHER

01:31:33.988 --> 01:31:36.224
THAT GOAL OF ENSURING ROBUST

01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:37.825
CONVERSATION THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:31:37.892 --> 01:31:40.061
SO THAT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO

01:31:40.127 --> 01:31:42.797

MANDATES AROUND --

01:34:06.273 --> 01:34:08.109
CHARTER SCHOOLS WHEN CHARTER

01:34:08.175 --> 01:34:09.710
SCHOOLS WILL QUALIFY --

01:34:09.777 --> 01:34:11.412
DID THE REST OF IT IS REALLY

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:13.447
DEPENDENT UPON WHAT THE COUNTY

01:34:13.514 --> 01:34:15.516
OFFICE HAS TO OFFER AND WHAT

01:34:15.583 --> 01:34:18.185
THEY CAN OR CANNOT OFFER ME ARTS

01:34:18.252 --> 01:34:19.186
BE ABLE TO HELP THE DISTRICT.

01:34:19.253 --> 01:34:21.188
YOU WERE REFERENCING SCHOOLS

SCHOOLS ARE UNDER THE S. A PLAN.

01:34:23.224 --> 01:34:24.225
SO SCHOOLS HAVE A DARN GOOD FOR

01:34:24.291 --> 01:34:26.460
WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC TIED TO

01:34:26.527 --> 01:34:28.095
THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED

01:34:28.162 --> 01:34:28.596
UNDER SO.

01:34:28.662 --> 01:34:33.334
ALTHOUGH WE COULD WORK WITH THE

THEY CAN OFFERS WELL LOCALLY.

01:34:38.139 --> 01:34:39.707

01:34:39.774 --> 01:34:41.042
DISTRICT IS THE COUNTY.

01:34:41.108 --> 01:34:42.843

01:34:48.482 --> 01:34:49.683
IF DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO THE

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:51.118
COUNTY DO WE KNOW THAT.

OF FOLKS.

01:35:00.461 --> 01:35:01.028
WHO HAVE --

01:35:01.095 --> 01:35:03.030
ACTUALLY LESS THAN TEN DISTRICTS

01:35:03.097 --> 01:35:04.432
TO WHERE THE COUNTY IS NOT

01:35:04.498 --> 01:35:05.466
WORKING WITH THEM.

01:35:05.533 --> 01:35:07.268
AND AGAIN THIS IS THEIR SECOND

01:35:07.334 --> 01:35:08.536

01:35:14.608 --> 01:35:16.310
A COUNTY TYPICALLY THAT'S USE

THE DISTRICT LEVEL THAT'S RIGHT.

01:35:24.218 --> 01:35:25.386

OUR WORK THAT'S AROUND THE

01:35:26.687 --> 01:35:28.889

01:37:14.161 --> 01:37:16.230
DIFFERENT COUNTY OFFICES AROUND

01:37:16.297 --> 01:37:17.698
A PARTICULAR ISSUE LIKE

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:19.099
ABSENTEEISM TRUE IS THAT --

01:37:19.166 --> 01:37:21.168
TRUANCY THINGS OF THAT NATURE

01:37:25.139 --> 01:37:26.740
WE TOUCH MOST DISTRICTS.

01:37:26.807 --> 01:37:27.541
SO THAT'S WORKING WITH COUNTY

01:37:27.608 --> 01:37:30.177

TOGETHER WITH JUST THE ON THE

01:37:55.936 --> 01:37:56.704
WAS A THREE IN SEVENTY FOUR I

01:37:56.770 --> 01:37:58.038
BELIEVE.

01:37:58.105 --> 01:37:59.673
ELEAZAR THAT WERE --

01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:03.310
FOR THIS YEAR THAT HAD THE THE

01:38:03.377 --> 01:38:05.779

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:12.152
AND AND THEN AS I UNDERSTOOD

01:38:12.219 --> 01:38:13.287
THERE'S TWO HUNDRED THIRTY NINE

01:38:13.354 --> 01:38:15.389
NEW ELEAZAR ON THAT LIST THIS

01:38:15.456 --> 01:38:18.592
YEAR -- NOT

01:38:18.659 --> 01:38:21.328
NEW.

01:38:21.395 --> 01:38:23.897
SO THE I THINK THAT THAT THAT

01:38:23.964 --> 01:38:24.465
WAS COVERED IN LA A REMARKS

01:38:24.531 --> 01:38:24.732
ACTUALLY.

01:38:24.798 --> 01:38:26.500
AND IF YOU WANT TO CLARIFY.

01:38:26.567 --> 01:38:28.269
THAT P. SIR --

01:38:28.335 --> 01:38:29.570
SO I I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC

01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:31.238
NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME BUT SO

01:38:31.305 --> 01:38:33.307
THIS YEAR THERE WAS US THREE

01:38:33.374 --> 01:38:34.041
HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE

01:38:34.108 --> 01:38:36.010
DISTRICTS IN THAT INCLUDES

01:38:36.076 --> 01:38:36.610
THIRTY ONE COUNTY OFFICES BUT

01:38:36.677 --> 01:38:38.245
COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION LAST

01:38:38.312 --> 01:38:39.713
YEAR THERE WAS TWO HUNDRED AND

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:40.247
TWENTY EIGHT DISTRICTS SO

01:38:40.314 --> 01:38:41.882
THERE'S AN INCREASE.

01:38:41.949 --> 01:38:44.084
FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AN IMPORTANT

01:38:44.151 --> 01:38:44.652
ANOTHER NINETY THREE OF THE

01:38:44.718 --> 01:38:46.120
CITRIX MASTER DID EXIT THE

01:38:46.186 --> 01:38:47.655
PROGRAM RIGHT AND I SO I GOT

01:38:47.721 --> 01:38:48.922
THAT BUT THEN THAT THIS YEAR

01:38:48.989 --> 01:38:50.557
THERE WAS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY

01:38:50.624 --> 01:38:51.725
NINE NEW ELLIE ETS.

01:38:51.792 --> 01:38:54.728
AS PART OF THAT OVERALL.

01:38:54.795 --> 01:38:55.262
THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR

01:38:55.329 --> 01:38:56.764
NUMBER AND MY QUESTION REALLY IS

01:38:56.830 --> 01:39:00.034
I I NOTE THAT.

01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:02.036
IT TALKS ABOUT --

01:39:02.102 --> 01:39:03.570
THAT SOME OF THE REASONS FOR

01:39:03.637 --> 01:39:05.739
THAT WERE --

01:39:05.806 --> 01:39:07.541
IT DIDN'T KNOW WHERE.

01:39:07.608 --> 01:39:08.542
WHERE THEY AND --

01:39:08.609 --> 01:39:10.744
FALLING INTO THIS NEED WHAT

01:39:10.811 --> 01:39:13.280
WHICH WHICH STATE PRIORITY AREAS

01:39:13.347 --> 01:39:14.715
ARE THEY LACKING IN THAT ARE

01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:16.350
CAUSING THEM TO GET ON THE LIST

01:39:16.417 --> 01:39:18.252
IS IS KIND OF MY QUESTION WE CAN

01:39:18.319 --> 01:39:19.053
DEFINITELY PROVIDE YOU THAT

01:39:19.119 --> 01:39:20.754
INFORMATION I THINK IT'S REALLY

01:39:20.821 --> 01:39:22.956
IMPORTANT. TO KNOW THAT LAST

01:39:23.023 --> 01:39:24.558
YEAR'S MEASURES.

01:39:24.625 --> 01:39:25.192
HAVE GREATLY DIFFERED FROM THIS

01:39:25.259 --> 01:39:26.393
YEAR'S MEASURES BECAUSE OF

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:28.195
ADDITIONAL DATA AS WE WERE AB

01:39:28.262 --> 01:39:29.730
ABLE TO ADD FOR THE FIRST TIME

01:39:29.797 --> 01:39:30.831
CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM.

01:39:30.898 --> 01:39:32.700
THEY'RE ABLE TO ADD A COLLEGE

01:39:32.766 --> 01:39:35.769
CAREER INDICATES DUE TO OUR

01:39:35.836 --> 01:39:37.204
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE FEDERAL

01:39:37.271 --> 01:39:38.272
GOVERNMENT OF OUR INTER EVERY

01:39:38.339 --> 01:39:39.640
STUDENT SUCCEEDS ACT AND SO.

01:39:39.707 --> 01:39:42.409
A GRADE ELEVEN NOW PLAYS INTO TO

01:39:42.476 --> 01:39:43.677
TRADITIONAL INDICATOR SO SO

01:39:43.744 --> 01:39:44.778
REALLY THE METRICS THAT WERE

01:39:44.845 --> 01:39:46.280
USING FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

01:39:46.347 --> 01:39:47.281
IN THOSE ADDITIONAL TWO AND

01:39:47.348 --> 01:39:48.215
FORTY THREE ARE ARE GREATLY

01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:49.883
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WAS

01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:51.552
HAPPENING IN.

01:39:51.618 --> 01:39:52.186
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN BUT I CAN

01:39:52.252 --> 01:39:53.921
DEFINITELY PROVIDE YOU THAT THAT

01:39:53.987 --> 01:39:57.825
DATA -- IT

IN A COMPREHENSIVE FORMAT --

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:01.762
ELECTRONICALLY YOU HAVE WE GET

01:40:01.829 --> 01:40:03.030
THEN I NOTICED THAT YOU KNOW SO

01:40:03.097 --> 01:40:04.932
IT WAS DEALING WITH HOMELESS --

01:40:04.998 --> 01:40:07.234
SHERIDAN SOME WAS DEALING WITH --

01:40:07.301 --> 01:40:08.635
I THINK FOSTER YOUTH --

01:40:08.702 --> 01:40:10.404
AND OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO TRY AND

01:40:10.471 --> 01:40:11.271
GET A A WHAT IS IT THAT WERE

01:40:11.338 --> 01:40:13.006
MISSING WITH REGARD TO THESE

01:40:13.073 --> 01:40:15.175
POPULATIONS.

01:40:15.242 --> 01:40:15.776
RIGHT --

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:17.277
BECAUSE AT I MEAN I THINK THAT'S

01:40:17.344 --> 01:40:20.848
REALLY IMPORTANT THING FOR US TO

01:40:20.914 --> 01:40:22.583
KNOW POLICY WAS IS.

01:40:22.649 --> 01:40:23.550
IS NO WHERE THOSE THINGS BE

01:40:23.617 --> 01:40:25.753
MISSED AT THAT LEVEL --

01:40:25.819 --> 01:40:26.420
CERTAINLY IT'S GOOD TO KNOW THAT

01:40:26.487 --> 01:40:27.521
DOES THOSE GROUPS THAT ARE

01:40:27.588 --> 01:40:29.289
AFFECTED BUT WHAT IS IT THAT'S

01:40:29.356 --> 01:40:30.891
NOT BEING DONE.

01:40:30.958 --> 01:40:32.192
AND SO IF YOU CAN GET THAT

01:40:32.259 --> 01:40:33.560
INFORMATION BACK TO US I MEAN

01:40:33.627 --> 01:40:35.662
COULD YOU DO THAT IN A WRITTEN

01:40:35.729 --> 01:40:36.897
FORM BACK TO THE COMMITTEE HERE.

01:40:36.964 --> 01:40:38.232
I THINK THEY WERE GONNA BE

01:40:38.298 --> 01:40:40.467
SPENDING THAT THAT THE NEXT YEAR

01:40:40.534 --> 01:40:41.602
COVERING THAT BECAUSE WE'LL HAVE

01:40:41.668 --> 01:40:43.237
TO YEARS OF METRICS COME TWO

01:40:43.303 --> 01:40:44.872
THOUSAND AND NINETEEN WITH WITH

01:40:44.938 --> 01:40:47.174
THE COUNTY IS BEING INVOLVED IN

01:40:47.241 --> 01:40:48.008
THAT SYSTEM OF SUPPORT AT YOU

01:40:48.075 --> 01:40:48.609
KNOW.

01:40:48.675 --> 01:40:50.744
SIR THAT FIRST GROUND LEVEL THAT

01:40:50.811 --> 01:40:51.545
STATE --

01:40:51.612 --> 01:40:52.579
MISTER MOLINA SPOKE ABOUT --

01:40:52.646 --> 01:40:53.847
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT

01:40:53.914 --> 01:40:55.115
SOME OF THE ROOT CAUSES WE

01:40:55.182 --> 01:40:56.784
SIMPLY WITH THE DASHBOARD TELL

01:40:56.850 --> 01:40:58.652
THEM YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WE DON'T

01:40:58.719 --> 01:40:59.653
AREN'T ABLE TO SAY.

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.989
WHAT IS CAUSING THAT PROBLEM I

01:41:02.055 --> 01:41:05.092
THINK THE OTHER THAT'S A IS THAT

01:41:05.159 --> 01:41:06.260
THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A

01:41:06.326 --> 01:41:08.195
LEGISLATION THAT TOLD US THAT WE

01:41:08.262 --> 01:41:09.129
HAVE TO USE IT?

01:41:09.196 --> 01:41:10.397
A SMALLER NUMBER --

01:41:10.464 --> 01:41:11.331
WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT STUDENT

01:41:11.398 --> 01:41:13.133
POPULATION SO FAR OUR OTHER

01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:14.234
STUDENT GROUPS IT'S IT'S AN AND

01:41:14.301 --> 01:41:16.003
SIZE OF THIRTY FOR FOSTER IN FOR

01:41:16.069 --> 01:41:17.938
HOMELESS IT'S GOES DOWN?

01:41:18.005 --> 01:41:20.174
TO FIFTEEN SO WE ARE --

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:21.074
CAPTURING --

01:41:21.141 --> 01:41:21.542
YOU KNOW.

01:41:21.608 --> 01:41:23.377
PROBABLY A LARGER PERCENTAGE OF

01:41:23.444 --> 01:41:25.245
FOSTER AND AND HOMELESS --

01:41:25.312 --> 01:41:26.580
DUE TO THAT SMALLER --

01:41:26.647 --> 01:41:27.915
SUBGROUP BUT BUT IT IS THAT

01:41:27.981 --> 01:41:29.716
THERE IS AN INCREASED FOCUS ON

01:41:29.783 --> 01:41:32.352
MAKES I'M OF COURSE ARE MOST

01:41:32.419 --> 01:41:34.588
NEED YOUR STUDENTS.

01:41:34.655 --> 01:41:35.289
IF.

01:41:35.355 --> 01:41:36.323
IF YEAH IF I COULD JUST ADD TO

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:38.659
THAT A LITTLE BIT AYE I THINK --

01:41:38.725 --> 01:41:39.193
THE THE QUESTION OUT THAT

01:41:39.259 --> 01:41:40.394
ANALYSIS OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

01:41:40.461 --> 01:41:41.528
THE NUMBERS I I THINK WHAT WE

01:41:41.595 --> 01:41:43.297
HAVE IT WE'VE ATTEMPTED TO DO

01:41:43.363 --> 01:41:44.798
THAT AND AND WE CERTAINLY CAN.

01:41:44.865 --> 01:41:46.600
S. FOLLOWING UP ON THIS HEARING

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:48.035
SHARE WHAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE

01:41:48.101 --> 01:41:49.870
THAT THE CHALLENGES IT'S VERY

01:41:49.937 --> 01:41:51.338
HARD TO YOU BECAUSE OF THAT THAT

01:41:51.405 --> 01:41:53.207
CHANGE IN THE INDICATORS THAT

01:41:53.273 --> 01:41:54.675
WERE INCLUDED IN THE DASHBOARD.

01:41:54.741 --> 01:41:56.076
AND IN PARTICULAR YOU KNOW

01:41:56.143 --> 01:41:57.845
CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM.

01:41:57.911 --> 01:41:58.612
THEY WERE VERY LIMITED

01:41:58.679 --> 01:41:59.847
INDICATORS THAT APPLIED AT THE

01:41:59.913 --> 01:42:00.848
K. EIGHT LEVEL.

01:42:00.914 --> 01:42:03.317
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF ELEMENTARY

01:42:03.383 --> 01:42:03.917
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT REALLY

01:42:03.984 --> 01:42:04.585
ONLY HAD.

01:42:04.651 --> 01:42:06.086
EFFECTIVELY THREE COLORS ON THE

01:42:06.153 --> 01:42:08.455
DASHBOARD AND SO WHEN YOU ADD IN

01:42:08.522 --> 01:42:09.890
THOSE ADDITIONAL INDICATORS THAT

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:11.792
THE NUMBER OF COMBINATIONS THAT

01:42:11.859 --> 01:42:12.826
CAN LEAD TO IDENTIFICATION

01:42:12.893 --> 01:42:13.427
INCREASED.

01:42:13.494 --> 01:42:15.229
SO AS FAR AS REALLY GETTING TO

01:42:15.295 --> 01:42:17.931
THAT QUESTION OF WHAT ANY

01:42:17.998 --> 01:42:20.300
RELIABLE CONCLUSIONS JUST WITH

01:42:20.367 --> 01:42:21.935
THAT SORT OF ONE YEAR OF DATA IS

01:42:22.002 --> 01:42:23.337
GIVEN THE CHANGE BUT WE CAN

01:42:23.403 --> 01:42:24.671
SHARE WHAT WE FOUND.

01:42:24.738 --> 01:42:25.372
BUT I THINK IT'S MISS BECAUSE ON

01:42:25.439 --> 01:42:27.341
A SAID AS WE LOOK TO NEXT YEAR'S

01:42:27.407 --> 01:42:28.876
DASH FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN

01:42:28.942 --> 01:42:30.644
DASH BOARD WE WILL BE ABLE TO

01:42:30.711 --> 01:42:32.212
HAVE GREATER LEVELS HEARD.

01:42:32.279 --> 01:42:33.680
UNDERSTANDING FROM YEAR TO YEAR

01:42:33.747 --> 01:42:35.148
THAT IT'S COMPATIBLE THERE WILL

01:42:35.215 --> 01:42:36.416
BE SOME DIFFERENCES BUT THEY

01:42:36.483 --> 01:42:37.451
WILL BE MUCH.

01:42:37.518 --> 01:42:39.453
MUCH SMALLER IN TERMS OF THEIR

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:43.090
OVERALL IMPACT SO I THINK WE WEHOPE WE WILL BE ABLE DROPPED

01:42:43.156 --> 01:42:44.091
BETTER CONCLUSIONS THAT CAN

01:42:44.157 --> 01:42:46.026
INFORM SOME OF THE STATE LEVEL

01:42:46.093 --> 01:42:47.528
POLICY CONVERSATIONS --

01:42:47.594 --> 01:42:49.196
IN A WAY THAT THAT'S MORE

01:42:49.263 --> 01:42:50.264
RELIABLE IN TERMS OF THE

01:42:50.330 --> 01:42:51.865
CONCLUSIONS.

01:42:51.932 --> 01:42:53.233
BUT I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE

01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:54.234
I THINK I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

01:42:54.301 --> 01:42:55.102
ASKING BILL AND I THINK IT'S THE

01:42:55.168 --> 01:42:56.537
RIGHT QUESTION IS SO.

01:42:56.603 --> 01:42:57.704
I'LL USE SPECIAL ED FOR EXAMPLE

01:42:57.771 --> 01:42:59.072
IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA LAST

01:42:59.139 --> 01:43:00.474
YEAR AND THIS YEAR THAT'S THE

01:43:00.541 --> 01:43:03.777
LARGEST SUBGROUP THAT CONTINUES

01:43:03.844 --> 01:43:04.411
TO QUALIFY.

01:43:04.478 --> 01:43:05.045
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:05.712
DID LAST YEAR'S WE WORK WITH THE

01:43:05.779 --> 01:43:07.614
DEPARTMENT IN PARTICULAR TO GO

01:43:07.681 --> 01:43:08.882
FURTHER INTO THE DATA.

01:43:08.949 --> 01:43:10.717
IS THE DATA WILL TELL YOU.

01:43:10.784 --> 01:43:11.852
THAT THE OF SPECIAL ED STUDENTS

01:43:11.919 --> 01:43:13.086
AND THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT MEETING

01:43:13.153 --> 01:43:15.389
THE EXPECTATIONS RIGHT BUT SO

01:43:15.455 --> 01:43:16.890
WHAT THAT DOESN'T TELL YOU IS

01:43:16.957 --> 01:43:17.558
WHY.

01:43:17.624 --> 01:43:19.126
SO WHAT'S HAPPENING AND SO WHEN

01:43:19.192 --> 01:43:19.893
IT COMES TO SPECIAL ED FOR

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:22.429
EXAMPLE PEOPLE MAY SPECULATE AND

01:43:22.496 --> 01:43:25.599
SAY WELL IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:43:25.666 --> 01:43:27.601
THEY TEND --

01:43:27.668 --> 01:43:28.268
TO CLASS BY A LOT OF HIS SPECIAL

01:43:28.335 --> 01:43:29.136
THAT WE FOR A LOT OF STUDENTS TO

01:43:29.202 --> 01:43:30.304
SPECIAL EDUCATION ANOTHER PIECE

01:43:30.370 --> 01:43:31.305
THAT YOU CAN LOOKAT IN

01:43:31.371 --> 01:43:33.040
PARTICULAR IS HOW OFTEN ARE

01:43:33.106 --> 01:43:34.341
STUDENTS ACTUALLY SPENDING TIME

01:43:34.408 --> 01:43:37.277
IN THE REGULAR CLASSROOM.

01:43:37.344 --> 01:43:39.212
LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT.

01:43:39.279 --> 01:43:40.581
WHEN YOU GO IN AND DO THE

01:43:40.647 --> 01:43:42.115
DIFFERENCES SYSTEMS YOU'RE ABLE

01:43:42.182 --> 01:43:43.550
TO UNPACK THAT DATA LOCALLY?

01:43:43.617 --> 01:43:45.485
SO FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THINGS WE

01:43:45.552 --> 01:43:47.321
FOUND LAST YEAR IS IS WHERE.

01:43:47.387 --> 01:43:49.523
DISTRICTS THAT HAD WE'RE WE'RE

01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:50.557
READ RIGHT THEY DIDN'T MEET THE

01:43:50.624 --> 01:43:53.093
CRITERIA MORE THAN ONE AREA.

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:54.494
THE THE MORE IS THAT THEY DIDN'T

01:43:54.561 --> 01:43:55.295
NEED IT WILL BE FOUND TO

01:43:55.362 --> 01:43:56.730
STUDENTS WERE ACTUALLY IN THE

01:43:56.797 --> 01:43:58.231
CLASSROOM LAST TIME.

01:43:58.298 --> 01:44:01.401
SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE WE CAN NEED

01:44:01.468 --> 01:44:04.037
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT DAY

01:44:04.104 --> 01:44:05.606
BECAUSE NOW YOU CAN START HAVING

01:44:05.672 --> 01:44:07.240
SOME CONVERSATIONS AROUND WHY

01:44:07.307 --> 01:44:09.543
WHY THE STUDENTS NINE CLASSROOMS.

01:44:09.610 --> 01:44:11.278
RIGHT WHAT WHERE ARE THEY RIGHT

01:44:11.345 --> 01:44:12.980
AND WHAT WE FOUND ALSO IS THAT

01:44:13.046 --> 01:44:15.415
STUDENTS ARE IN CLASSROOMS GET

01:44:15.482 --> 01:44:16.350
SUSPENDED MORE.

01:44:16.416 --> 01:44:17.618
PARTICULAR BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:44:17.684 --> 01:44:19.152
STRANGERS OFTEN RIGHT IN SO

01:44:19.219 --> 01:44:20.554
THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THAT COULD

01:44:20.621 --> 01:44:21.521
BE DIFFERENT FOR EVERY SINGLE

01:44:21.588 --> 01:44:23.056
DISTRICT THAT DIFFERENCES

01:44:23.123 --> 01:44:24.958
SYSTEMS PROCESS ALLOWS YOU TO

01:44:25.025 --> 01:44:26.059
REALLY GET OUT THAT.

01:44:26.126 --> 01:44:27.728
DAY JENNIFER I WHAT'S DIFFERENT

01:44:27.794 --> 01:44:29.162
ABOUT THIS DISTRICT BASED BASED

01:44:29.229 --> 01:44:30.631
ON THEIR DATA SO YOU CAN

01:44:30.697 --> 01:44:33.634
ACTUALLY GO IN AND START TO DO

01:44:33.700 --> 01:44:35.102
SOME PROBLEM SOLVING.

01:44:35.168 --> 01:44:39.373
THANK YOU SURE.

01:44:39.439 --> 01:44:41.108
THANKS JUST HAD A COUPLE QUICK

01:44:41.174 --> 01:44:41.942
QUESTIONS --

01:44:42.009 --> 01:44:43.710
FOR MISTER NOW --

01:44:43.777 --> 01:44:45.278
YOU'D MENTIONED SORT OF THE WORK

01:44:45.345 --> 01:44:46.780
THAT YOU'RE DOING IN INGLEWOOD

01:44:46.847 --> 01:44:47.948
AND COUPLE OTHER DISTRICTS.

01:44:48.015 --> 01:44:49.683
DO YOU ALSO TRACK DISTRICTS THAT

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:53.920
ARE SORT OF ON THE CUSP AND DO

01:44:53.987 --> 01:44:54.554
ASSISTANCE PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO

01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:55.856
THEM.

01:44:55.922 --> 01:44:56.923
WELL HAS HARD TO TRACK HIM

01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.691
BECAUSE WORD WERE JUST IN OUR

01:44:57.758 --> 01:45:00.460
FIRST COUPLE YEARS WITH THE DATA

01:45:00.527 --> 01:45:01.895
RIGHT SO THERE ARE THE THE A WE

01:45:01.962 --> 01:45:02.963
HAVE OUR THIS OUR SECOND YEAR OF

01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:04.498
ACTUALLY HAVING DATA THAT'S

01:45:04.564 --> 01:45:06.400
IDENTIFIED BASED ON YOUR

01:45:06.466 --> 01:45:07.734
DIFFERENCES ASSISTANCE --

01:45:07.801 --> 01:45:09.836
SO NO ANSWERS WE DON'T TRACK

01:45:09.903 --> 01:45:11.271
THEM AT THIS POINT TWO WE ARE.

01:45:11.338 --> 01:45:12.939
FOCUSED ON THOSE WHO ACTUALLY

01:45:13.006 --> 01:45:14.841
QUALIFY HARD TO KNOW WHO WOULD

01:45:14.908 --> 01:45:17.944
QUALIFY NEXT YEAR --

01:45:18.011 --> 01:45:18.545
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU THOUGH IS

01:45:18.612 --> 01:45:21.548
THAT WERE ROUND THOSE DISTRICTS

01:45:21.615 --> 01:45:22.883
ARE IN FISCAL DISTRESS AROUND

01:45:22.949 --> 01:45:24.351
THIS I MENTION THAT WE'RE DOING

01:45:24.418 --> 01:45:25.819
THESE ACADEMIC REVIEWS?

01:45:25.886 --> 01:45:27.220
AND WE'RE FINDING IS IS WHEN YOU

01:45:27.287 --> 01:45:28.889
GO AND WEEKS THOSE ACADEMIC

01:45:28.955 --> 01:45:30.057
REVIEWS WE BELIEVE COULD BE A

01:45:30.123 --> 01:45:31.591
TOOL THAT WE COULD USE FOR ANY

01:45:31.658 --> 01:45:32.526
DISTRICT.

01:45:32.592 --> 01:45:34.227
RIGHT AND SO THAT WE INSTEAD OF

01:45:34.294 --> 01:45:36.363
JUST THOSE DISTRICTS THAT ARE

01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:38.565
ARE QUALIFYING ANDRIY EIGHTEEN

01:45:38.632 --> 01:45:39.199
FORTY WERE ACTUALLY TRYING TO

01:45:39.266 --> 01:45:40.967
IDENTIFY THESE TOOLS AND HAVE

01:45:41.034 --> 01:45:42.436
SOME IDEAS TO WORK WITH COUNTY

01:45:42.502 --> 01:45:44.137
OFFICES TO TRAIN ON THE USE OF

01:45:44.204 --> 01:45:44.938
THOSE TOOLS.

01:45:45.005 --> 01:45:46.339
SO THEY COULD THEY KNOW WHO

01:45:46.406 --> 01:45:47.941
THOSE LOCAL DISTRICTS ARE AND BE

01:45:48.008 --> 01:45:50.310
ABLE TO USE THAT TOOL TO BE ABLE

01:45:50.377 --> 01:45:51.344
TO HELP FOLKS SO THAT VIEWERS

01:45:51.411 --> 01:45:52.746
WERE ABLE TO APPROACH HIM BEFORE

01:45:52.813 --> 01:45:54.848
THEY GO INTO DIFFERENCES SYSTEMS.

01:45:54.915 --> 01:45:56.583
AND AND WITH WHAT YOU SEEN FROM

01:45:56.650 --> 01:45:58.118
THE DISTRICTS THAT YOU ARE

01:45:58.185 --> 01:46:00.187
ASSISTING TO SEE ANY COMMON

01:46:00.253 --> 01:46:01.388
THREADS THAT ARE.

01:46:01.455 --> 01:46:03.023
SORT OF DRIVING THEM TO DISTRESS

01:46:03.090 --> 01:46:05.025
YEAH WE DO WHAT WHAT WE FIND IN

01:46:05.092 --> 01:46:06.126
THERE IS A COUPLE THINGS IT

01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:07.994
WON'T SURPRISE YOU ONE IS IS

01:46:08.061 --> 01:46:08.995
THAT YOU KNOW WE USE THE WORD

01:46:09.062 --> 01:46:11.098
COHERENCE OFTEN THEY HAVE A LOT

01:46:11.164 --> 01:46:12.799
OF THINGS IN PLACE THINGS IN

01:46:12.866 --> 01:46:14.000
PLACE LIKE.

01:46:14.067 --> 01:46:15.469
THEY MAY HAVE A CURRICULUM IN

01:46:15.535 --> 01:46:17.971
PLACE RIGHT BUT HOW IT'S BEING

01:46:18.038 --> 01:46:19.639
IMPLEMENTED IS DIFFERENT.

01:46:19.706 --> 01:46:20.774
ON AND EVERY SCHOOL SITE THEY

01:46:20.841 --> 01:46:21.441
MAY HAVE --

01:46:21.508 --> 01:46:23.076
TIME FOR TEACHERS TO BE IN

01:46:23.143 --> 01:46:24.244
PROFESSIONAL LEARNING GROUPS

01:46:24.311 --> 01:46:25.412
RIGHT WITH A MINIMUM DAY

01:46:25.479 --> 01:46:26.813
TEACHERS COME TOGETHER.

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:28.081
HOW THEY MANAGE THAT TIME

01:46:28.148 --> 01:46:29.716
TOGETHER IS DIFFERENT IN EVERY

01:46:29.783 --> 01:46:30.550
SCHOOL --

01:46:30.617 --> 01:46:32.853
DAYS SOME HAVE MORE PROFESSIONAL

01:46:32.919 --> 01:46:34.554
DEVELOPMENT AND OTHERS USE OF

01:46:34.621 --> 01:46:36.323
DATA IS AN ISSUE WE ALSO HAVE A

01:46:36.389 --> 01:46:37.958
HUGE TURNOVER IN THOSE DISTRICTS

01:46:38.024 --> 01:46:39.526
THEIR LEADERSHIP TEAMS IN

01:46:39.593 --> 01:46:40.193
PARTICULAR.

01:46:40.260 --> 01:46:41.762
INGLEWOOD FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS

01:46:41.828 --> 01:46:43.063
THE FIRST YEAR THAT THEY'VE HAD

01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:50.537
THE SAME CABINET LEVEL TEAM.

01:46:50.604 --> 01:46:52.005
THAT THEY'VE HAD SEVEN YEARS SO

01:46:52.072 --> 01:46:53.206
PEOPLE COMING AND GOING ALL THE

01:46:53.273 --> 01:46:55.375
TIME TO CIVILIAN PEACE OR

01:46:55.442 --> 01:46:57.377
NOTICING TO IS THERE IS A THEIR

01:46:57.444 --> 01:46:58.245
ABILITY THEIR CAPACITY. TO

01:46:58.311 --> 01:46:59.179
ACTUALLY DO THINGS TO ACTUALLY

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:00.647
MAKE IMPROVEMENTS THIS IS A

01:47:00.714 --> 01:47:01.448
STRUGGLE IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE

01:47:01.515 --> 01:47:02.582
THEY ARE VERY FOCUSED ON TRYING.

01:47:02.649 --> 01:47:03.350
TO FIGURE OUT HOW FISCALLY

01:47:03.416 --> 01:47:06.520
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET

01:47:06.586 --> 01:47:08.989
FISCAL DISTRESS AND SO OFTEN

01:47:09.055 --> 01:47:11.291
ACADEMICS ARE LEFT BEHIND.

01:47:11.358 --> 01:47:12.793
WHAT WERE THESE TWO ISSUES I

01:47:12.859 --> 01:47:14.828
IMAGINE THEY OUGHT TO DO WITH

01:47:14.895 --> 01:47:16.630
ARE DECLINING ENROLLMENT?

01:47:16.696 --> 01:47:18.665
YES AND HOW ARE THEY GRAPPLING

01:47:18.732 --> 01:47:20.700
WITH THAT THERE'S A GROWING WITH

01:47:20.767 --> 01:47:21.735
THAT AND I GUESS YOU SENT YOU

01:47:21.802 --> 01:47:23.270
OVERSEE OAKLAND IN OAKLAND JUST

01:47:23.336 --> 01:47:24.671
GOT THROUGH A TEACHERS STRIKE.

01:47:24.738 --> 01:47:25.438
WHAT WHAT WHAT DID YOU WHAT DID

01:47:25.505 --> 01:47:28.608
YOU THINK HOW DID YOU THINK THAT?

01:47:28.675 --> 01:47:30.310
RESOLUTION --

01:47:30.377 --> 01:47:32.078
YOU KNOW WAS.

01:47:32.145 --> 01:47:34.247
WAS RESOLVED TO DEFY HERE WAS A

01:47:34.314 --> 01:47:36.616
GOOD RESOLUTION CONCERNING --

01:47:36.683 --> 01:47:37.417
I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE AN

01:47:37.484 --> 01:47:38.318
OPINION ON ON THEIR THEIR

01:47:38.385 --> 01:47:39.753
RESOLUTION IN REGARDS TO THEIR

01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:41.555
CONTRACT THE THING I CAN TELL

01:47:41.621 --> 01:47:42.556
YOU IS THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO CUT

01:47:42.622 --> 01:47:43.623
MORE PROGRAMS.

01:47:43.690 --> 01:47:45.225
RIGHT AND SO --

01:47:45.292 --> 01:47:46.526
SOME OF OUR WORK AROUND OAKLAND

01:47:46.593 --> 01:47:47.994
IS SEVEN SUMMER HAVE INITIAL

01:47:48.061 --> 01:47:49.196
DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM OF

01:47:49.262 --> 01:47:50.497
ACTUALLY TRYING TO HELP THEM

01:47:50.564 --> 01:47:51.865
DETERMINE WHAT TO CUT.

01:47:51.932 --> 01:47:53.667
CONSTRUCTION WE CYLINDER EL CAP

01:47:53.733 --> 01:47:55.569
THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THINGS THEY

01:47:55.635 --> 01:47:56.469
WANT TO DO TO HELP KIDS AND

01:47:56.536 --> 01:47:57.237
STRUCTURALLY.

01:47:57.304 --> 01:47:58.305
SO THEY'VE ASKED US TO LOOK AT

01:47:58.371 --> 01:47:59.539
THE RAIL KAPANEN HAVE

01:47:59.606 --> 01:48:01.474
CONVERSATIONS AND SAY THEY HAVE

01:48:01.541 --> 01:48:03.143
THEIR LIST OF CUTS.

01:48:03.210 --> 01:48:05.178
IN TO SAY IF THEY CUT THIS HOW

01:48:05.245 --> 01:48:05.846
WOULD THAT'D BE ABLE POWER THAT

01:48:05.912 --> 01:48:07.814
AFFECT THEM ACADEMICALLY AND

01:48:07.881 --> 01:48:08.982
SUCH I TO HELP WOMEN UP TO CLICK

01:48:09.049 --> 01:48:10.016
AND ARE YOU ARE YOU SAYING THAT

01:48:10.083 --> 01:48:11.117
WITH THE OTHER --

01:48:11.184 --> 01:48:17.524
DISTRICTS AS WELL YES ABSOLUTELY

01:48:17.591 --> 01:48:18.091
AND ARE THEY ARE THEY MAKING

01:48:18.158 --> 01:48:18.692
THOSE.

01:48:18.758 --> 01:48:20.060
VERY DIFFICULT CHOICES I MEAN WE

01:48:20.126 --> 01:48:21.127
DON'T WE DON'T LIKE MAKING CUTS

01:48:21.194 --> 01:48:22.362
I'M SURE THEY DON'T LIKE MAKING

01:48:22.429 --> 01:48:22.863
CUTS THOSE ARE NOT FUN.

01:48:22.929 --> 01:48:23.797
FUN THINGS TO BE DOING YEAH THEY

01:48:23.864 --> 01:48:24.764
ARE YESTERDAY FOR EXAMPLE WE

01:48:24.831 --> 01:48:25.365
SPENT THE MORNING WITH VALLEJO

01:48:25.432 --> 01:48:27.000
IN VALLEJO WAS CUT AND FIFTEEN

01:48:27.067 --> 01:48:27.834
MILLION DOLLARS FROM THEIR

01:48:27.901 --> 01:48:28.335
BUDGET.

01:48:28.401 --> 01:48:29.703
AND SO PART OF OUR CONVERSATIONS

01:48:29.769 --> 01:48:31.271
YESTERDAY WAS THE THE REDUCING A

01:48:31.338 --> 01:48:32.472
COUPLE SCHOOLS ARE TRYING TO

01:48:32.539 --> 01:48:34.174
HELP THEM DETERMINE HOW WE WOULD

01:48:34.241 --> 01:48:35.842
BE ABLE TO HELP THEM IN THAT

01:48:35.909 --> 01:48:37.344
AREAS ARE DOING THAT --

01:48:37.410 --> 01:48:39.312
THEY ARE LOSING PRINCIPLES AND

01:48:39.379 --> 01:48:42.115
SO HAVE NUMBER DEVELOPING A

01:48:42.182 --> 01:48:43.950
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN

01:48:44.017 --> 01:48:45.151
FOR THEM.

01:48:45.218 --> 01:48:45.785
IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE

01:48:45.852 --> 01:48:47.354
CAN HELP THEM HOW THEY'RE GONNA

01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:48.955
BE ABLE TO FUND THAT RIGHT IN

01:48:49.022 --> 01:48:50.557
LOOKING AT THOSE PIECES.

01:48:50.624 --> 01:48:52.959
AND HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU FOCUS

01:48:53.026 --> 01:48:54.728
ON YOUR SOURCE I CANNOT BE LIKE

01:48:54.794 --> 01:48:56.730
THE EMERGENCY ROOM PHYSICIAN

01:48:56.796 --> 01:48:57.864
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DO SOME

01:48:57.931 --> 01:48:59.165
TRIAGE HOW DO YOU.

01:48:59.232 --> 01:49:04.271
HOW DO YOU CREATE STABILITY

01:49:04.337 --> 01:49:04.838
BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE

01:49:04.905 --> 01:49:05.906
HARDEST?

01:49:05.972 --> 01:49:06.539
THE HARDEST THING TO DO BECAUSE

01:49:06.606 --> 01:49:07.040
IF YOU DON'T.

01:49:07.107 --> 01:49:08.541
QUEST ABILITY YOU DON'T MAINTAIN

01:49:08.608 --> 01:49:09.976
ENROLLMENT IF YOU DON'T MAINTAIN

01:49:10.043 --> 01:49:11.177
AROMA YOU TO MAINTAIN FUNDING SO

01:49:11.244 --> 01:49:13.179
HOW DO YOU.

01:49:13.246 --> 01:49:14.014
HOW TO CREATE THAT STABILITY

01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:15.649
YEAH I THINK THE BEST EXAMPLE IS

01:49:15.715 --> 01:49:16.516
PROBABLY IN THE WOODS SO

01:49:16.583 --> 01:49:17.951

01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:35.936
DISTRICT IN PARTICULAR THAT HAS

01:49:36.002 --> 01:49:37.570
A LOT OF SPECIAL ED CONCERNS AND

01:49:37.637 --> 01:49:38.438
WE LOOKED AT THE ACADEMIC

01:49:38.505 --> 01:49:39.606
PROGRAMS SO WE SPENT TIMES

01:49:39.673 --> 01:49:41.007
ACTUALLY TRYING TO ANALYZE WHAT

01:49:49.649 --> 01:49:50.984
AREAS THEY'RE IDENTIFIED

01:49:51.051 --> 01:49:52.752
STRATEGIES.

BE BASHING THOSE QUARTERLY.

01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:03.530
SO WE CONSIDER THE IMPACT THAT

01:50:03.596 --> 01:50:06.299
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO SO WE

01:50:06.366 --> 01:50:07.467

O'DONNELL'S QUESTION.

01:50:20.647 --> 01:50:22.315
OR IS THAT IS THAT STRICTLY WHAT

01:50:22.382 --> 01:50:23.717
FIFTH MAN DOES.

01:50:23.783 --> 01:50:24.751

PHYSICALLY AND ACADEMICALLY.

01:50:53.013 --> 01:50:53.546
BECAUSE ONE OF MY MORE MORE

01:50:53.613 --> 01:50:55.849
GLOBAL CONCERNS JUST WATCHING ON

01:50:55.915 --> 01:50:57.283
SOME OF THE STRIKES PLAY OUT IS.

01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:58.451
HOW?

01:50:58.518 --> 01:51:00.854
ON MANY DISTRICTS ARE SORT OF ON

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:01.488
THE EDGE IT IS JUST TRYING TO

01:51:01.554 --> 01:51:02.555
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE RIGHT.

01:51:02.622 --> 01:51:04.090
SOLUTION TO CREATE THAT

01:51:04.157 --> 01:51:06.393
STABILITY FOR THEM IS --

01:51:06.459 --> 01:51:09.295
BECAUSE IT SEEMS --

01:51:09.362 --> 01:51:10.897
RATHER THAN.

01:51:10.964 --> 01:51:12.699
THE RATHER THAN THE BAR'S ANY

01:51:12.766 --> 01:51:13.767
FOR THIS TO PRETEND IT SORT OF

01:51:13.833 --> 01:51:16.169
MAKING THESE VERY DIFFICULT

01:51:16.236 --> 01:51:17.370
DECISIONS THEY SEEM TO BE.

01:51:17.437 --> 01:51:19.172
YOU KNOW LOOKING TOWARDS US FOR

01:51:19.239 --> 01:51:20.974
MORE MONEY --

01:51:21.041 --> 01:51:24.477
WHICH AGAIN AS I THINK IT'S KIND

01:51:24.544 --> 01:51:25.745
OF A POLITICAL PLOY GOOD

01:51:25.812 --> 01:51:28.415
POLITICAL POINT BUT NOT REALLY --

01:51:28.481 --> 01:51:30.450
SOMETHING THAT'S GROUNDED IN

01:51:30.517 --> 01:51:31.484
REALITY.

01:51:31.551 --> 01:51:34.220
SO WHICH I GUESS IS ESPECIALLY

01:51:34.287 --> 01:51:36.022
FOR THE DISTRICT FOR YOUR I MEAN

01:51:36.089 --> 01:51:38.792
IN THAT OAKLAND'S.

01:51:38.858 --> 01:51:40.093
OPEN SIX APPLE ONE OF THEM RIGHT

01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:41.327
YOUR THAT YOUR WORK WAS HOW DOES

01:51:41.394 --> 01:51:43.596
HOW DO YOU --

01:51:43.663 --> 01:51:44.764
HOW DO YOU PROVIDE THE

01:51:44.831 --> 01:51:47.534
OPPORTUNITY? FOR FOR FOLKS TO

01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:50.370
SORT OF WHAT LAY THE GROUNDWORK

01:51:50.437 --> 01:51:51.738
FOR FOLKS TO MAKE THOSE

01:51:51.805 --> 01:51:54.340
DIFFICULT DECISIONS.

01:51:54.407 --> 01:51:56.142
HELLO WANTED THINGS I THINK

01:51:56.209 --> 01:51:57.343
BULLARD.

01:51:57.410 --> 01:51:58.578
AGAIN MY WORKERS ON THE ACADEMIC

01:51:58.645 --> 01:51:59.546
SIDE SO I COULD SPEAK MORE

01:51:59.612 --> 01:52:00.914
DIRECTLY TO THAT I WAS A COUNTY

01:52:00.980 --> 01:52:02.482
SUPERINTENDENT RIGHT AND SO IS A

01:52:02.549 --> 01:52:04.150
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT FOR MANY

01:52:04.217 --> 01:52:05.518
YEARS I CAN TELL YOU.

01:52:05.585 --> 01:52:07.087
WHEN WE HAD DISTRICTS THAT

01:52:07.153 --> 01:52:08.555
REALLY STRUGGLED?

01:52:08.621 --> 01:52:10.056
THERE WERE DECISIONS THAT THEY

01:52:10.123 --> 01:52:10.857
SHOULD HAVE MADE SOONER.

01:52:10.924 --> 01:52:12.926
RIGHT AND SO IN PARTICULAR WE

01:52:12.992 --> 01:52:13.660
WOULD WE WOULD FIND DISTRICTS

01:52:13.726 --> 01:52:15.462
WHO WERE DECLINING ENROLLMENT

01:52:15.528 --> 01:52:17.297
AND MAYBE WE'RE NOT REACTING

01:52:17.363 --> 01:52:18.698
QUICK ENOUGH SO FOR EXAMPLE

01:52:18.765 --> 01:52:20.767
YOU'LL SEE SCHOOL CLOSURES WHICH

01:52:20.834 --> 01:52:22.335
IS VERY DIFFICULT.

01:52:22.402 --> 01:52:23.636
TO BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE SCHOOL

01:52:23.703 --> 01:52:25.705
COOL YOU LOOK AT HOW MANY

01:52:25.772 --> 01:52:27.040
EXISTENCE SOME OF THOSE

01:52:27.107 --> 01:52:28.408
DISTRICTS LIKE.

01:52:28.475 --> 01:52:31.111
OAKLAND IN LIKE IN THE LATE HOLE

01:52:31.177 --> 01:52:33.113
MOST OF THE SAME SCHOOLS ARE

01:52:33.179 --> 01:52:33.947
STILL OPEN.

01:52:34.013 --> 01:52:35.448
RIGHT WOULD SEVEN OR EIGHT

01:52:35.515 --> 01:52:36.516
THOUSAND STUDENTS.

01:52:36.583 --> 01:52:38.051
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO

01:52:38.118 --> 01:52:40.320
DO COMMUNITY DOESN'T LIKE IT FOR

01:52:40.386 --> 01:52:41.254
ITS I'VE DONE IT MYSELF --

01:52:41.321 --> 01:52:42.155
BUT THAT'S AN EXAMPLE TO WEAR

01:52:42.222 --> 01:52:44.691
THE SOONER YOU CAN REACT TO MAKE

01:52:44.757 --> 01:52:46.593
SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS IT HELPS

01:52:46.659 --> 01:52:47.694
GOING DOWN.

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:48.595
DOWN THE ROAD THE THING I CAN

01:52:48.661 --> 01:52:52.132
TELL YOU ON THE ACADEMIC PIECES

01:52:52.198 --> 01:52:53.199
IS THAT.

01:52:53.266 --> 01:52:53.867
I THINK I MENTIONED TO THERE ARE

01:52:53.933 --> 01:52:54.901
A LOT OF RESOURCES EVEN IN THE

01:52:54.968 --> 01:52:56.836
SCHOOLS BUT THERE'S NO COHERENCE

01:52:56.903 --> 01:52:57.403
TO IT.

01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:58.071
AND SO ONE OF THINGS THAT WE'RE

01:52:58.138 --> 01:52:59.339
TRYING TO SAY IS WITH THE

01:52:59.405 --> 01:53:00.807
RESOURCES THAT YOU DO HAVE.

01:53:00.874 --> 01:53:01.975
MANY OF MY HAVE INSTRUCTIONAL

01:53:02.041 --> 01:53:03.810
COACHES FOR EXAMPLE HOW CAN WE

01:53:03.877 --> 01:53:04.744
MAKE SURE THAT THE INSTRUCTIONAL

01:53:04.811 --> 01:53:06.312
COULDN'T WE'RE GETTING THE MOST

01:53:06.379 --> 01:53:06.846
OUT OF THOSE INSTRUCTIONAL

01:53:06.913 --> 01:53:07.847
COACHES.

01:53:07.914 --> 01:53:09.149
HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT TRYING

01:53:09.215 --> 01:53:10.717
TO BE MORE SYSTEMIC ACROSS THE

01:53:10.783 --> 01:53:12.252
DISTRICT AND OW WE'RE DOING

01:53:12.318 --> 01:53:13.720
THAT WORKS AT LEAST WE GET THE

01:53:13.786 --> 01:53:15.054
BEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK WITH THE

01:53:15.121 --> 01:53:17.323
MONEY SAID?

01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:19.993
THAT CONTINUE TO EXIST.

01:53:20.059 --> 01:53:21.661
THIS SERVICE IS NOT A SINGLE

01:53:21.728 --> 01:53:23.196
OAKLAND OPERATE SORT OF TOP OF

01:53:23.263 --> 01:53:24.964
MIND SINCE IT'S BEEN THERE IN

01:53:25.031 --> 01:53:28.601
THE PRESS MOST OF OUR FLIGHT --

01:53:28.668 --> 01:53:30.336
YOU'D MENTIONED THAT THE THE

01:53:30.403 --> 01:53:32.305
SCHOOL CLOSURE SHOW AND I FORGOT

01:53:32.372 --> 01:53:34.741
THIRD THE RESOLUTION TO DATE

01:53:34.807 --> 01:53:37.243
OAKLAND OAKLAND HAD A FAIRLY --

01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:38.044
FOR THE WELL LAID OUT PLAN

01:53:38.111 --> 01:53:40.413
AROUND SCHOOL CLOSURES AND MY

01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:41.781
AND MY RECOLLECTION AND AND

01:53:41.848 --> 01:53:42.749
FORGIVE ME IF I REMEMBER

01:53:42.815 --> 01:53:44.184
RECOLLECTING CORRECTLY BUT THAT

01:53:44.250 --> 01:53:47.020
THEY PUNTED ON THAT ISSUE

01:53:47.086 --> 01:53:47.320
[inaudible]

01:53:47.387 --> 01:53:50.823
AND SO.IS THAT ONE IS THAT CORRECT IN

01:53:50.890 --> 01:53:52.959
THE TO WIN WIN TO PUT A DISTRICT

01:53:53.026 --> 01:53:53.693
AND WITH YOU KNOW UNDER YOUR

01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:54.694
GUIDANCE IS DOING THAT HOW DO

01:53:54.761 --> 01:53:56.896
YOU.

01:53:56.963 --> 01:53:57.597
GET THEM TO THE BACK ON THE

01:53:57.664 --> 01:53:59.265
CONTRACT.

01:53:59.332 --> 01:54:00.533
WELL A COUPLE THINGS ABOUT THAT

01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:01.134
DISTRICT GUIDE I BELIEVE THAT

01:54:01.201 --> 01:54:02.135
THEY WERE MORE IN THE MIX TO

01:54:02.202 --> 01:54:02.802
LOOK AFTER THEY HAD ALREADY MADE

01:54:02.869 --> 01:54:03.670
SOME DECISIONS ON SCHOOL

01:54:03.736 --> 01:54:04.938
CLOSURES THAT THEY ARE GOING

01:54:05.004 --> 01:54:06.906
THROUGH WITH THIS YEAR --

01:54:06.973 --> 01:54:08.341
TO I THINK THE OTHER ONE THAT

01:54:08.408 --> 01:54:10.143
THEY'VE LOOKED AT EVEN THE ONES

01:54:10.210 --> 01:54:10.743
THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT

01:54:10.810 --> 01:54:12.378
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT YEAR

01:54:12.445 --> 01:54:13.980
BECAUSE IT TAKES SOME TIME TO SO

01:54:14.047 --> 01:54:15.615
I THINK THEY JUST AGREED FOR

01:54:15.682 --> 01:54:17.550
THIS NEXT FOUR MONTHS OF FUN.

01:54:17.617 --> 01:54:20.253
AGAIN MISTER A TO FIND FROM FAKE

01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:24.324
NAKED -- BUT

01:54:24.390 --> 01:54:25.425
CLEARLY IN OUR WORK.

01:54:25.491 --> 01:54:26.626
AS I MENTIONED IN INGLEWOOD SO

01:54:26.693 --> 01:54:28.228
GREAT EXAMPLE OF THOSE FIVE

01:54:28.294 --> 01:54:29.295
AREAS ONE OF THOSE FACILITIES

01:54:29.362 --> 01:54:31.531
WERE IT WAS SPECIFICALLY LOOKING

01:54:31.598 --> 01:54:33.566
AT FACILITIES AND SAYING OKAY.

01:54:33.633 --> 01:54:35.435
HOW MANY FACILITIES YOU HAVE?

01:54:35.501 --> 01:54:36.669
WHICH ONES DO WE NEED TO LOOK AT

01:54:36.736 --> 01:54:37.971
THE YOU KNOW WE NEED TO LOOK AT

01:54:38.037 --> 01:54:39.973
SCHOOL CLOSURES CAN BE LOOK AT

01:54:40.039 --> 01:54:40.540
SELLING SOME OF THOSE OTHER

01:54:40.607 --> 01:54:41.474
FACILITIES.

01:54:41.541 --> 01:54:42.675
OTHER WAYS BECAUSE FACILITIES

01:54:42.742 --> 01:54:44.310
ARE A LARGE COSTS SO THAT IS IN

01:54:44.377 --> 01:54:45.712
THE PLAN THAT IS PART OF THE

01:54:45.778 --> 01:54:46.913
DISCUSSION AGAIN WHICH I THINK

01:54:46.980 --> 01:54:48.248
IS UNIQUE.

01:54:48.314 --> 01:54:49.549
ABOUT EIGHTEEN FORTY THIS IS A

01:54:49.616 --> 01:54:53.519
PUTS US AT THE TABLE WITH ON THE

01:54:53.586 --> 01:54:56.589
FISCAL AND ACADEMIC SIDE.

01:54:56.656 --> 01:54:58.124
GREAT DID I TALK ABOUT LOOK AT

01:54:58.191 --> 01:55:00.660
THE STATE BORDERDEPARTMENT OF

JUST A QUICK.

01:55:34.727 --> 01:55:37.196
QUESTION TO BOTH THE THE STATE

01:55:37.263 --> 01:55:39.032
BOARD IN THAT DEPARTMENT OF AND

01:55:39.098 --> 01:55:40.433
IN TERMS OF THE TRANSPARENCY

01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:42.402

01:55:45.638 --> 01:55:46.639
COMMENT ON THE DASHBOARD THE

01:55:46.706 --> 01:55:47.507
DASHBOARD LOOKS.

01:55:47.573 --> 01:55:48.174
I THINK --

01:55:48.241 --> 01:55:49.609
VERY GOOD MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN

01:55:49.676 --> 01:55:51.511
THE I GUESS VERSION ONE POINT OH

01:55:51.577 --> 01:55:52.312
IF THE ALL CAPS I THINK IT'S A

01:55:52.378 --> 01:55:53.346
REALLY GREAT STEP IN THE RIGHT

01:55:53.413 --> 01:55:55.782
DIRECTION REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

01:55:55.848 --> 01:55:58.885
BUT JUST WANTED TO SEE HOW P. T.

01:55:58.951 --> 01:56:00.953
A.'S OR IS IT --

01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:02.422
YOU KNOW LOCAL COMMUNITY GROUPS

01:56:02.488 --> 01:56:07.460
OR JUST RANDOM PARENTS HOW HOW

01:56:07.527 --> 01:56:08.027
IT THE INFORMATION IS BEING

01:56:08.094 --> 01:56:09.329
DIGEST.

01:56:09.395 --> 01:56:10.897
SO ALL START ON THAT THE LOCAL

01:56:10.963 --> 01:56:12.165
ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN PUT PIECES

01:56:12.231 --> 01:56:12.832
BUT MISS BECAUSE HONEST MAY HAVE

01:56:12.899 --> 01:56:13.833
SOMETHING MORE THE DASHBOARD

01:56:13.900 --> 01:56:14.834
BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY CLOSELY

01:56:14.901 --> 01:56:16.069
RELATED AND I THINK

01:56:16.135 --> 01:56:17.503
COMPLEMENTARY --

01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:20.073
THAT BUDGET SUMMARY FOR PARENTS

01:56:20.139 --> 01:56:22.408
IS YET BEING ADOPTED LOCALLY FOR

01:56:22.475 --> 01:56:23.976
THE FIRST TIME THIS COMING BY

01:56:24.043 --> 01:56:25.144
JULY FIRST OF THIS COMING YEAR

01:56:25.211 --> 01:56:27.380
SO AS FAR AS HOW IT'S BEING USED

01:56:27.447 --> 01:56:28.715
LOCALLY AND HOW PEOPLE ARE

01:56:28.781 --> 01:56:29.849
REACTING TO IT LOCALLY AND

01:56:29.916 --> 01:56:31.784
SPECIFIC EXAMPLES WE REALLY

01:56:31.851 --> 01:56:32.685
DON'T HAVE.

01:56:32.752 --> 01:56:34.754
MUCH INFORMATION ON THAT WE HAVE

01:56:34.821 --> 01:56:36.322
GOTTEN AND THE DEPARTMENT

01:56:36.389 --> 01:56:37.256
EDUCATION REALLY TOOK THE LEAD

01:56:37.323 --> 01:56:38.691
ON DEVELOPING THE FORMAT FOR

01:56:38.758 --> 01:56:40.927
THAT THERE WAS SOME CLEAR

01:56:40.993 --> 01:56:42.362
GUIDANCE IN THE BILLING WHICH

01:56:42.428 --> 01:56:42.995
FROM LAST YEAR --

01:56:43.062 --> 01:56:44.364
BUT GETTING SOME FEEDBACK FROM

01:56:44.430 --> 01:56:47.400
FROM DIFFERENT USERS AND I THINK.

01:56:47.467 --> 01:56:49.001
UNIFORMLY IT'S BEEN GENERALLY

01:56:49.068 --> 01:56:53.506
POSITIVE AS FAR AS THE THE RIGHT

01:56:53.573 --> 01:56:54.307
GRAIN SIZES MAY BE HOW I WOULD

01:56:54.374 --> 01:56:56.943
PUT IT AS FAR AS THAT ONE OF THE

01:56:57.009 --> 01:56:57.977
LARGEST.

01:56:58.044 --> 01:56:59.846
GUY CRITICISMS I GUESS I WOULD

01:56:59.912 --> 01:57:02.915
PUT IT OF THE EL CAP A PRIOR TO

01:57:02.982 --> 01:57:04.650
TWO YEARS AGO WAS IT WAS VERY

01:57:04.717 --> 01:57:06.085
DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE

01:57:06.152 --> 01:57:08.187
ACTIONS AND SERVICES AND

01:57:08.254 --> 01:57:08.955
EXPENDITURES PROPOSING THE ALL

01:57:09.021 --> 01:57:09.689
CAPS.

01:57:09.756 --> 01:57:10.990
FIT INTO THE ALLEY IS OVERALL

01:57:11.057 --> 01:57:14.060
BUDGET THIS DOCUMENT THIS NEW

01:57:14.127 --> 01:57:15.628
DOCUMENT KIND OF PULLS TOGETHER

01:57:15.695 --> 01:57:16.696
IN ONE PLACE.

01:57:16.763 --> 01:57:18.464
THAT CONNECTION TO THE LOCAL

01:57:18.531 --> 01:57:20.233
BUDGET WHICH WAS KIND OF

01:57:20.299 --> 01:57:22.101
INTENDED THAT THAT OUT THE LOCAL

01:57:22.168 --> 01:57:23.369
COUNTY THE PLAN SUPPOSED TO BE.

01:57:23.436 --> 01:57:25.071
SERVE THE OPERATIONAL PLAN FOR

01:57:25.138 --> 01:57:26.639
IMPLEMENTING THE LIKELY ADOPTED

01:57:26.706 --> 01:57:28.241
BUDGET IT REALLY BUILT THAT

01:57:28.307 --> 01:57:29.842
LINKAGE BUT WITHOUT GOING IT

01:57:29.909 --> 01:57:30.810
THAT'S A HUNDRED TWENTY PAGE

01:57:30.877 --> 01:57:32.845
DOCUMENT LIKE IT'S NOT REALISTIC

01:57:32.912 --> 01:57:34.013
THAT ANYONE.

01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:35.314
NORMAL PERSON IS GOING TO DIG

01:57:35.381 --> 01:57:36.382
INTO THAT SO THIS IS A THREE

01:57:36.449 --> 01:57:38.050
PAGE DOCUMENT THAT REALLY GIVES

01:57:38.117 --> 01:57:39.152
THOSE HIGH LEVEL SUMMARIES

01:57:39.218 --> 01:57:41.687
OVERALL BUDGET PICTURE WHAT'S IN

01:57:41.754 --> 01:57:42.422
THE EL CAP.

01:57:42.488 --> 01:57:43.856
AND WHAT'S TIED TO INCREASE

01:57:43.923 --> 01:57:44.490
IMPROVE SERVICES FOR HIGH NEED

01:57:44.557 --> 01:57:45.825
STUDENTS.

01:57:45.892 --> 01:57:47.760
AS WELL AS AN UPDATE ON WHAT WAS

01:57:47.827 --> 01:57:49.128
PROPOSED IN THE PRIOR YEAR FOR

01:57:49.195 --> 01:57:50.963
INCREASED IMPROVE SERVICES WHAT

01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:52.365
HAPPENED WITH THIS.

01:57:52.432 --> 01:57:53.533
YEAH WAS IT DID YOU DO WHAT YOU

01:57:53.599 --> 01:57:54.700
SAID YOU WERE GOING TO DO SO IN

01:57:54.767 --> 01:57:56.002
GENERAL AS FAR AS LIKE THOSE KEY

01:57:56.068 --> 01:57:57.503
TOPICS I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN

01:57:57.570 --> 01:57:58.171
GENERALLY BUT IT'S NOT FROM THE

01:57:58.237 --> 01:57:59.172
END USER.

01:57:59.238 --> 01:58:00.406
WHICH IS REALLY PARENTS SO I

01:58:00.473 --> 01:58:01.941
THINK WE'LL LEARN A LOT MORE

01:58:02.008 --> 01:58:03.676
AFTER THIS SORT OF CYCLE COMES

01:58:03.743 --> 01:58:04.343
AROUND.

01:58:04.410 --> 01:58:05.878
ON THE BRIGHTER UPDATES TO THE

01:58:05.945 --> 01:58:07.747
LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN --

01:58:07.814 --> 01:58:09.449
THAT IS FOR THAN THE UPCOMING EL

01:58:09.515 --> 01:58:11.150
CAPITAN OPTION NOT THE ONE RIGHT

01:58:11.217 --> 01:58:13.219
NOW BUT FOR THE NEXTEL CAP THE

01:58:13.286 --> 01:58:14.654
BOARD'S ACTUALLY CAN BE.

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:17.890
ADOPTING THE NEW TEMPLATE WE'RE

01:58:17.957 --> 01:58:19.625
HOPING BY NOVEMBER.

01:58:19.692 --> 01:58:21.194
OF THIS YEAR AND SO WE'VE

01:58:21.260 --> 01:58:22.695
ALREADY STARTED OUR COLLEAGUES

01:58:22.762 --> 01:58:23.296
AT THE DEPARTMENT OF RESERVED

01:58:23.362 --> 01:58:24.497
TIME TO DO THAT BIG STAKEHOLDER

01:58:24.564 --> 01:58:25.865
PROCESS.

01:58:25.932 --> 01:58:27.533
ON SOME OF THE KEY AGAIN THE

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:28.768
STATURE LANGUAGE WAS.

01:58:28.835 --> 01:58:30.403
VERY SPECIFIC IN SOME REGARDS SO

01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:31.938
THERE ISN'T A GREAT DEAL OF

01:58:32.004 --> 01:58:33.873
DISCRETION ON SOME PIECES BUT TO

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:34.874
TRY TO GET FEEDBACK AND SOME OF

01:58:34.941 --> 01:58:36.542
THOSE KEY DESIGN CHOICES THAT

01:58:36.609 --> 01:58:38.077
THE BOARD WILL HAVE TO MAKE.

01:58:38.144 --> 01:58:39.645
AS FAR AS HOW TO MAKE THIS

01:58:39.712 --> 01:58:42.215
INFORMATION AS YOU TRY TO GET IT

01:58:42.281 --> 01:58:43.816
I THINK THE ISSUE WAS HOW LONG

01:58:43.883 --> 01:58:45.151
THE DOCUMENT IS.

01:58:45.218 --> 01:58:46.586
SOME OF THAT ISN'T SOLVABLE

01:58:46.652 --> 01:58:48.020
COMPLETELY BUT THERE MAY BE SOME

01:58:48.087 --> 01:58:49.422
WAYS THAT WE CAN REALLY TRY TO

01:58:49.489 --> 01:58:51.657
MAKE IT MORE DIGESTIBLE DOCUMENT.

01:58:51.724 --> 01:58:53.125
EVEN IF THE OVERALL DOCUMENT

01:58:53.192 --> 01:58:54.393
STILL HAS SOME LENGTH YOU CAN

01:58:54.460 --> 01:58:56.629
PULL OUT MAYBE SEVEN EIGHT PAGES.

01:58:56.696 --> 01:58:58.164
THEY GIVE A FULLPICTURE OF

01:58:58.231 --> 01:59:00.399
WHAT'S BEEN SORT OF ADOPTED AT

01:59:00.466 --> 01:59:02.735
THE LOCAL LEVEL.

01:59:02.802 --> 01:59:04.103
IT ENDED JUST STATE GUY AGAIN

01:59:04.170 --> 01:59:05.805
YEAH THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE IS

01:59:05.872 --> 01:59:07.907
REALLY OUR BASS FIRST FOR SHOT

01:59:07.974 --> 01:59:09.876

01:59:09.942 --> 01:59:11.511
GET FEEDBACK IF WE NEED TO MAKE.

01:59:11.577 --> 01:59:13.713
CHANGES I THINK THERE'S SOME

01:59:13.779 --> 01:59:15.715

02:15:06.131 --> 02:15:08.033
WELL WE ARE CURRENTLY ESTIMATING

02:15:08.099 --> 02:15:09.968
THEIR DEFICIT THAT IS SUBJECT TO

02:15:10.035 --> 02:15:13.338

HERE PROGRESS HAS BEEN

02:15:24.683 --> 02:15:26.585
INCONSISTENT THE COUNTY OFFICE

02:15:26.651 --> 02:15:28.587

ROLE IN EIGHTEEN FORTY IT IS

02:15:30.622 --> 02:15:31.990
DIFFERENT IN THOSE TWO DISTRICTS

02:15:32.057 --> 02:15:33.458

02:15:33.525 --> 02:15:34.793
AND LOTS OF DISCUSSIONS.

02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:35.961
BUT THEY'RE VERY DIFFERENT

02:15:36.027 --> 02:15:37.796
REMEMBER THAT ANGLE WOULD --

02:15:37.863 --> 02:15:39.097
HAS BEEN THROUGH THIS PROCESS

02:15:39.164 --> 02:15:41.533
NOW FOR SIX YEARS AND IS

02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:44.202

THE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT.

02:15:48.673 --> 02:15:51.076
OAKLAND GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO

02:15:51.142 --> 02:15:51.710
TWO THOUSAND THREE WENT THROUGH

02:15:51.776 --> 02:15:53.945
THAT INTENSE RECOVERY PROCESS

02:15:54.012 --> 02:15:55.514
WERE CERTIFIED IS RECOVERED

02:15:55.580 --> 02:15:57.349
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS A FORTY WAS

02:15:57.415 --> 02:15:58.950
RETURNED TO THEM FOR OVER A

02:15:59.017 --> 02:16:00.118
DECADE.

02:16:00.185 --> 02:16:01.219
AND THEN QUESTIONS BEGAN TO

02:16:01.286 --> 02:16:03.288
SURFACE LAST YEAR ABOUT THEIR

02:16:03.355 --> 02:16:04.356
FISCAL STATUS.

02:16:04.422 --> 02:16:06.224
ARM AND SO THEY HAVE A TRUSTEE

02:16:06.291 --> 02:16:09.127
IN PLACE BUT THERE LOCAL BOARD --

02:16:09.194 --> 02:16:10.896
IS GOVERNING THE DISTRICT AND

02:16:10.962 --> 02:16:12.130
THEY HAVE A SUPERINTENDENT IN

02:16:12.197 --> 02:16:17.135
PLACE HIRED BY THAT LOCAL BOARD.

02:16:17.202 --> 02:16:18.036
HE'S A TEACHER JUST COULD YOU

02:16:18.103 --> 02:16:18.236
TELL.

02:16:18.303 --> 02:16:18.803
EXPLAIN WHY.

02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:21.172
WHY THERE'D BE A A TRUSTEE THERE

02:16:21.239 --> 02:16:23.842
IN THE LOCAL MORE WOULD RETAIN?-SO THAT IS THE LONG ESTABLISHED

02:16:23.909 --> 02:16:25.710
PROCESS THE STATE UNTIL THEY PAY

02:16:25.777 --> 02:16:27.145
OFF THEIR LOAN THE STATE CLEARLY

02:16:27.212 --> 02:16:29.180
HAS AN INTEREST IN THEIR FISCAL

02:16:29.247 --> 02:16:30.749
STABILITY BECAUSE IN OAKLAND

02:16:30.815 --> 02:16:32.083
CASE THEY NEED TO MAKE IT EIGHT

02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:33.218
MILLION PLUS.

02:16:33.285 --> 02:16:34.986
PAYMENT EACH YEAR TO THE STATE --

02:16:35.053 --> 02:16:36.788
A COMBINATION OF STATE GENERAL

02:16:36.855 --> 02:16:40.492
FUND LOAN AND I BANK LOAN --

02:16:40.559 --> 02:16:41.026
AND SO IT'S IN THE STATE'S

02:16:41.092 --> 02:16:43.361
INTEREST --

02:16:43.428 --> 02:16:45.096
TO HAVE A TRUSTY IN PLACE IT HAS

02:16:45.163 --> 02:16:46.798
STAINED RESCIND AUTHORITY SHOULD

02:16:46.865 --> 02:16:49.501
THE DISTRICTS DEVIATE FROM ITS

02:16:49.568 --> 02:16:51.136
FINANCIAL STABILITY PLAN --

02:16:51.202 --> 02:16:52.304
AND THEREFORE PUT THAT LOAN

02:16:52.370 --> 02:16:56.207
PAYMENT AT JEOPARDY IN JEOPARDY --

02:16:56.274 --> 02:16:56.708
AND SO THAT'S REALLY THE

02:16:56.775 --> 02:16:59.044
DISTINCTION --

02:16:59.110 --> 02:17:00.979
GOVERNANCE LEADERSHIP --

02:17:01.046 --> 02:17:03.615
IN OTHER DISTRICTS CERTAINLY

02:17:03.682 --> 02:17:05.784
CONTINUE TO HAVE DEFICIENCIES --

02:17:05.850 --> 02:17:08.286
DATA LACKS CREDIBILITY --

02:17:08.353 --> 02:17:10.922
WE AS AN ORGANIZATION --

02:17:10.989 --> 02:17:13.224
THERE ON ON ALMOST A DAILY BASIS

02:17:13.291 --> 02:17:14.726
IN SOME FASHION --

02:17:14.793 --> 02:17:15.894
DO BELIEVE THAT THEY HAVE THE

02:17:15.961 --> 02:17:18.663
ABILITY TO GET THEMSELVES OUT OF

02:17:18.730 --> 02:17:19.798
THIS CURRENT --

02:17:19.864 --> 02:17:22.033
FISCAL DISTRESS WITHOUT

02:21:53.805 --> 02:21:55.907
EFFECTIVELY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

OF AUDIT REQUEST THAT WE GET --

02:25:20.545 --> 02:25:21.879
HOWEVER THAT IS --

02:25:21.946 --> 02:25:23.448
ACTUALLY DOWN QUITE A BIT --

02:25:23.514 --> 02:25:25.083
FROM BUT WHILE VERY MENTIONED

02:25:27.051 --> 02:25:28.419
OUT TO DOWN FROM LAST YEAR --

02:25:28.486 --> 02:25:29.921
THEY WOULD BE TRUE FOR BOTH

02:25:29.987 --> 02:25:31.355
CHARTERS AND REGULAR --

02:25:31.422 --> 02:25:35.226

BUDGET IN THE SUMMER.

02:25:46.804 --> 02:25:47.371
AND THEN --

02:25:47.438 --> 02:25:49.173
THEIR FIRST IN ARM THEY FILED

02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:52.877
NEGATIVE LAST WEEK AND IT WAS

02:25:52.944 --> 02:25:54.445
ALSO NEGATIVE.

02:25:54.512 --> 02:25:56.013
THERE COUNTY BUSES THAT DOES

02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:57.415
HAVE YOUR NEGATIVE.

02:25:57.482 --> 02:25:59.617
THE KIND OF THE WAY IT WORKS --

02:25:59.684 --> 02:26:00.918
YES THERE ISN'T REALLY A

02:26:00.985 --> 02:26:04.422
DOWNGRADE FROM NEGATIVE --

02:26:04.489 --> 02:26:05.022
SO PRETTY NOW --

02:26:05.089 --> 02:26:06.190
THAT IN SOME RESPECTS COUNTY

02:26:06.257 --> 02:26:07.391
DOESN'T GET A CHOICE ON THAT YOU

02:26:07.458 --> 02:26:09.494
BUT YES THAT NEGATIVE HIS FAULT

02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:10.761
IN THEIR CASE BOTH THE FIRST

02:26:10.828 --> 02:26:12.363
ENORMOUS SECOND IN OUR NEGATIVES

IN CONCERT WITH THE COUNTY

02:26:14.499 --> 02:26:16.033
OFFICE I GUESS MY POINT IS THAT

02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:17.568
COUNTY IF YOU SUBMIT A BUDGET

02:26:17.635 --> 02:26:18.769

ACTUALLY QUALIFIED OR NEGATIVE

02:26:20.304 --> 02:26:21.472
THE COUNTY.

02:26:21.539 --> 02:26:22.974
WOULDN'T CAN DOWNGRADE THAT

02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:25.409
COULD DOWNGRADE THAT SWEAT WHERE

02:26:25.476 --> 02:26:27.378
THEY WHERE THEY WERE THEY'RE A

02:26:27.445 --> 02:26:29.213
YEAR AGO. TWO YEARS AGO DO YOU

02:26:29.280 --> 02:26:32.917
KNOW -- TWO

02:26:32.984 --> 02:26:35.653
YEARS I'LL HAVE TO LOOK UP --

02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:38.456
LAST YEAR AT THIS POINT IN TIME

02:26:38.523 --> 02:26:40.024
I BELIEVE THEY WERE POSITIVE --

02:26:40.091 --> 02:26:42.460
THE PROCESS BEGAN LAST NOVEMBER

02:26:42.527 --> 02:26:45.997
OF SEVENTEEN SO JUST OVER A YEAR

02:26:46.063 --> 02:26:47.365
AGO -- WELL

02:26:47.431 --> 02:26:49.100
THERE'S A LONG HISTORY OF

02:26:49.167 --> 02:26:50.268
INTERACTION BETWEEN THE COUNTY

02:26:50.334 --> 02:26:52.236
IN THE DISTRICT WHERE THE COUNTY

02:26:52.303 --> 02:26:54.438
EXPRESSED CONCERNS BUT VERY

02:26:54.505 --> 02:26:56.107
SPECIFICALLY --

02:26:56.174 --> 02:26:58.242
IN RELATIONSHIP TO APPROVAL OF A

02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.876
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT

02:26:58.943 --> 02:27:02.280
AND EARLY DECEMBER OF SEVENTEEN

02:27:02.346 --> 02:27:04.549
ON THE COUNTY EXPRESSED IN

02:27:04.615 --> 02:27:06.384
AFFORDABILITY CONCERN --

02:27:06.450 --> 02:27:08.119
DID THAT AGAIN AT THEIR FIRST IN

02:27:08.186 --> 02:27:09.587
ROME THEIR SECOND IN AROUND THE

02:27:09.654 --> 02:27:11.522
DISTRICT WAS UNRESPONSIVE TO

02:27:11.589 --> 02:27:13.457
THOSE ITEMS --

02:27:13.524 --> 02:27:16.027
AND WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR UP

02:27:16.093 --> 02:27:19.597
BUDGET APPROVAL --

02:27:19.664 --> 02:27:20.198
IN THE SUMMER FOR THE NEW THE

02:27:20.264 --> 02:27:23.201
NEW FOR BUDGET.

02:27:23.267 --> 02:27:25.903
WHICH IS --

02:27:25.970 --> 02:27:27.171
IN SOME RESPECTS ONE OF THE

02:27:27.238 --> 02:27:29.440
HIGHER LEVELS OF INTERVENTION A

02:27:29.507 --> 02:27:30.942
COUNTY CAN TAKE THE CODE THEN

02:27:31.008 --> 02:27:32.810
PROVIDES FOR A PROCESS TO BE

02:27:32.877 --> 02:27:33.878
FOLLOWED.

02:27:33.945 --> 02:27:35.746
FULL TIME LINE AND WHO'S

02:27:35.813 --> 02:27:38.082
INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS ONCE A

02:27:38.149 --> 02:27:39.417
BUDGETS DISAPPROVED --

02:27:39.483 --> 02:27:41.986
COUNTY SIMPLY DOWNGRADED IN IN A

02:27:42.053 --> 02:27:43.688
REPORT IT KIND OF STOPS THERE

02:27:43.754 --> 02:27:45.590
OTHER THAN INTERVENTION --

02:27:45.656 --> 02:27:49.227
MAKE MAY COME INTO PLAY --

02:27:49.293 --> 02:27:51.629
BUT DISAPPROVAL OF A BUDGET

02:27:51.696 --> 02:27:53.264
OBVIOUSLY THE DISTRICT AT THAT

02:27:53.331 --> 02:27:54.432
POINT DOESN'T HAVE A

02:27:54.498 --> 02:27:56.167
EXPENDITURES FORTY THERE HAVE

02:27:56.234 --> 02:27:57.301
APPROPRIATIONS AUTHORITY.

02:27:57.368 --> 02:27:59.670
WHEN WHEN WHAT WHEN THE BUDGETS

02:27:59.737 --> 02:28:03.107
DISAPPROVED EARLY AND SO LOCAL

02:28:03.174 --> 02:28:03.541
BOARD APPROVES IT?

02:28:03.608 --> 02:28:05.142
THEY VOTE ON IT.

02:28:05.209 --> 02:28:05.710
THEN THEY SUBMITTED TO THE

02:28:05.776 --> 02:28:07.912
COUNTY YES BY JULY FIRST THE

02:28:07.979 --> 02:28:08.412
COUNTY GOES THROUGH AN

02:28:08.479 --> 02:28:10.881
EVALUATION PROCESS A CHECKLIST

02:28:10.948 --> 02:28:12.183
PROCESS.

02:28:12.250 --> 02:28:13.851
AN ANALYSIS PROCESS AND THEN

02:28:13.918 --> 02:28:15.720
MAKES A DETERMINATION OF WHETHER

02:28:15.786 --> 02:28:16.287
THEY CAN.

02:28:16.354 --> 02:28:17.755
APPROVE IT APPROVE IT WITH

02:28:17.822 --> 02:28:19.156
CONDITIONS OR DISAPPROVE IT

02:28:19.223 --> 02:28:20.324
THOSE ARE THE THREE CHOICES A

02:28:20.391 --> 02:28:21.826
COUNTY HOUSE.

02:28:21.892 --> 02:28:23.828
AND THEY DISAPPROVE IT.

02:28:23.894 --> 02:28:25.029
THEY THIS CASE THEY DID

02:28:25.096 --> 02:28:26.330
DISAPPROVE THAT'S CORRECT.

02:28:26.397 --> 02:28:28.899
AND THAT WHAT HAPPENS THAT --

02:28:28.966 --> 02:28:31.402
THAT SETS A BOTH A TIME LINE IN

02:28:31.469 --> 02:28:32.503
A PROCESS THAT.

02:28:32.570 --> 02:28:34.972
IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE AD CODE --

02:28:35.039 --> 02:28:37.375
FOR A BUDGET REVIEW COMMITTEE TO

02:28:37.441 --> 02:28:40.411
BE --

02:28:40.478 --> 02:28:41.646
ADDENDA FI --

02:28:41.712 --> 02:28:43.381
THE CORRECTIVE ACTION THAT NEEDS

02:28:43.447 --> 02:28:45.082
TO BE TAKEN AND THEN --

02:28:45.149 --> 02:28:45.683
IN ESSENCE RESUBMITTED TO THE

02:28:45.750 --> 02:28:46.517
COUNTY.

02:28:46.584 --> 02:28:48.519
THAT BUDGET REVIEW COMMISSION

02:28:48.586 --> 02:28:49.787
PROCESS --

02:28:49.854 --> 02:28:52.290
CAN BE WAIVED AND IN FACT.

02:28:52.356 --> 02:28:53.824
I THINK WE JUST DETERMINED IN

02:28:53.891 --> 02:28:54.859
THE LAST TEN YEARS IT'S BEEN

02:28:54.925 --> 02:28:57.795
WAIVED IN ALL CASES BUT ONE AND

02:28:57.862 --> 02:28:59.463
SO -- THE

02:28:59.530 --> 02:29:01.966
WAIVER PROVIDES GENERALLY THE

02:29:02.033 --> 02:29:03.200
PARTIES -- A

02:29:03.267 --> 02:29:05.436
LITTLE LESS FORMAL RESOLUTION

02:29:05.503 --> 02:29:06.537
PROCESS AND IT GIVES THEM AN

02:29:06.604 --> 02:29:08.572
EXTRA THIRTY DAYS TO ACHIEVE

02:29:08.639 --> 02:29:10.441
THAT WHEN YOU WAVE IT BUT THERE

02:29:10.508 --> 02:29:11.475
ARE STILL SOME.

02:29:11.542 --> 02:29:14.312
CONSTRAINTS EVEN WITHOUT THE

02:29:14.378 --> 02:29:16.414
BUDGET REVIEW --

02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:18.449
COMMITTEE PROCESS.

02:29:23.120 --> 02:29:24.922
ON THIS FOR FOR SACRAMENTO REAL

02:29:24.989 --> 02:29:25.756
QUICK.

02:29:25.823 --> 02:29:28.526
SO I I JUST WANTED TO TO ASK IT

02:29:28.592 --> 02:29:30.528
AND OVERALL QUESTION BEFORE I

02:29:30.594 --> 02:29:32.897
GET THE SACRAMENTO.

02:29:32.963 --> 02:29:34.031
I KNOW YOU YOU'VE BEEN HERE WITH

02:29:34.098 --> 02:29:36.000
THIS CHART FOR THE LAST FEW

02:29:36.067 --> 02:29:39.170
YEARS AND IT'S SOMEWHAT --

02:29:39.236 --> 02:29:40.504
ON THE QUITE.

02:29:40.571 --> 02:29:41.706
A QUITE ACCURATE PICTURE BECAUSE

02:29:41.772 --> 02:29:43.708
AT THIS POINT IF YEARS AGO WE

02:29:43.774 --> 02:29:44.575
STILL HAD.

02:29:44.642 --> 02:29:45.876
ROUGHLY FORTY DISTRICTS ARE

02:29:45.943 --> 02:29:47.745
QUALIFIED AND A HANDFUL THAT

02:29:47.812 --> 02:29:49.447
WERE NEGATIVE AND NOW WE HAVE

02:29:49.513 --> 02:29:49.980
THE SAME AMOUNT THAT ARE

02:29:50.047 --> 02:29:51.349
QUALIFIED AND DOUBLE THAT THERE

02:29:51.415 --> 02:29:52.183
ARE NEGATIVE [inaudible]

02:29:52.249 --> 02:29:54.919
BUT WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THIS

02:29:54.985 --> 02:29:56.887
IS BIG PICTURE BECAUSE IF IF YOU

02:29:56.954 --> 02:29:57.755
WOULD ASK SOMEBODY ON THE STREET

02:29:57.822 --> 02:29:58.055
[inaudible]

02:29:58.122 --> 02:30:00.157
HEY.

02:30:00.224 --> 02:30:02.393
STATE TAX REVENUE FIFTY PRESS

02:30:02.460 --> 02:30:04.095
THE INCREASE IN MONEY GOING TO

02:30:04.161 --> 02:30:05.062
OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS

02:30:05.129 --> 02:30:08.132
CALIFORNIA AND NOW WE HAVE MORE.

02:30:08.199 --> 02:30:11.369
THAT ARE IN TROUBLE SO HOW DO

02:30:11.435 --> 02:30:13.371
YOU RECONCILE.

02:30:13.437 --> 02:30:14.839
THAT THAT ISSUE WHICH JUST

02:30:14.905 --> 02:30:16.307
COMPOUNDS.

02:30:16.374 --> 02:30:18.075
US AND PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA

02:30:18.142 --> 02:30:19.477
WHEN THEY HEAR ABOUT THIS WELL I

02:30:19.543 --> 02:30:20.911
THINK IT COULD FOR CONFOUNDS US

02:30:20.978 --> 02:30:22.413
A LITTLE BIT TOO WE ARE AT A

02:30:22.480 --> 02:30:24.448
POINT AFTER SIX YEARS OF A

02:30:24.515 --> 02:30:26.884
SIGNIFICANT REINVESTMENT.

02:30:26.951 --> 02:30:29.253
RAH RESTORATION OF THE CUTS THAT

02:30:29.320 --> 02:30:30.654
WERE MADE IN THE GREAT RECESSION

02:30:30.721 --> 02:30:32.189
PLUS ADDITIONAL --

02:30:32.256 --> 02:30:34.759
BASICALLY GROWTH FUNDS AND AND

02:30:34.825 --> 02:30:36.594
THE QUESTION IS --

02:30:36.660 --> 02:30:38.696
IF THINGS SLOW DOWN NOW GOING

02:30:38.763 --> 02:30:40.931
FORWARD WE EXPECT TO SEE THIS

02:30:40.998 --> 02:30:43.768
KIND OF TREND TWO YEARS FROM NOW --

02:30:43.834 --> 02:30:45.069
MAYBE FOR A COUPLE DISTRICTS A

02:30:45.136 --> 02:30:46.604
YEAR FROM NOW ON THOSE TYPES OF

02:30:46.670 --> 02:30:49.707
THINGS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE --

02:30:49.774 --> 02:30:53.110
SO MANY AND FULL THAT ARE REALLY

02:30:53.177 --> 02:30:56.881
IN SOME EXTREME CONDITIONS IS --

02:30:56.947 --> 02:31:00.284
IS ABSOLUTELY A GREAT QUESTION --

02:31:00.351 --> 02:31:03.521
THEY ALL VERY SLIGHTLY IN IN THE

02:31:03.587 --> 02:31:05.256
REASONS FOR THAT THAT'S A GREAT

02:31:05.322 --> 02:31:05.756
QUESTION --

02:31:05.823 --> 02:31:07.057
IS ONE OF GREAT CONCERN NO IT'S

02:31:07.124 --> 02:31:09.393
BOTH IT'S A GREAT OBSERVATION IT

02:31:09.460 --> 02:31:11.095
IS A GREAT CONCERN BECAUSE WE'RE

02:31:11.162 --> 02:31:12.763
NOT DEALING WITH --

02:31:12.830 --> 02:31:14.799
SOME EASY FIXES IN IN SOME OF

02:31:14.865 --> 02:31:17.001
THESE CASES SO COMMON IN ALL OF

02:31:17.067 --> 02:31:17.768
THESE --

02:31:17.835 --> 02:31:19.437
LIKELY IS SOME DECLINE IN

02:31:19.503 --> 02:31:20.604
ENROLLMENT --

02:31:20.671 --> 02:31:22.706
ALTHOUGH SEX CITY SPECIFICALLY

02:31:22.773 --> 02:31:25.543
IS ABOUT A 1% THE CLIENTS BEEN

02:31:25.609 --> 02:31:27.711
RELATIVELY FLAT FOR THE LAST.

02:31:27.778 --> 02:31:30.080
FIVE SIX YEARS --

02:31:30.147 --> 02:31:32.683
SO DECLINE ENROLLMENT --

02:31:32.750 --> 02:31:34.018
CERTAINLY THE ITEMS THAT YOU

02:31:34.084 --> 02:31:34.852
HAVE HEARD FROM YOUR

02:31:34.919 --> 02:31:36.687
CONSTITUENTS ABOUT IN THIS

02:31:36.754 --> 02:31:38.189
REGARD ABOUT --

02:31:38.255 --> 02:31:39.824
PRESSURE POINTS FROM --

02:31:39.890 --> 02:31:41.859
INCREASE PENSIONS SPECIAL

02:31:41.926 --> 02:31:43.227
EDUCATION COSTS --

02:31:43.294 --> 02:31:44.829
AND THOSE THINGS BUT AT THE SAME

02:31:44.895 --> 02:31:46.597
TIME -- WE

02:31:46.664 --> 02:31:48.132
WOULD WE WOULD TAKE A VIEW THAT

02:31:48.199 --> 02:31:49.633
SAYS --

02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:52.269
ACROSS THE STATE WE HAVE ELEVEN

02:31:52.336 --> 02:31:52.870
HUNDRED AND SOME SCHOOL

02:31:52.937 --> 02:31:53.671
DISTRICTS.

02:31:53.737 --> 02:31:56.173
AND THEY EACH HAVE A GOVERNING

02:31:56.240 --> 02:31:56.974
BOARD WHO HAS A FIDUCIARY

02:31:57.041 --> 02:31:59.043
RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT

02:31:59.109 --> 02:32:00.511
THE DISTRICT IS LIVING WITHIN

02:32:00.578 --> 02:32:02.580
THE MEANS --

02:32:02.646 --> 02:32:07.084
TO GET EARLIER ABOUT YOU KNOW

02:32:07.151 --> 02:32:08.252
THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME PRESSURE

02:32:08.319 --> 02:32:10.254
POINTS OF THAT THIS NARRATIVE OF

02:32:10.321 --> 02:32:11.789
COMING TO THE STATE FOR MORE.

02:32:11.856 --> 02:32:14.124
AND MORE AND WHILE I DON'T THINK

02:32:14.191 --> 02:32:15.659
ANY OF US COULD ARGUE THAT --

02:32:15.726 --> 02:32:18.262
FUNDING OUR K. TWELVE IN K.

02:32:18.329 --> 02:32:19.330
FOURTEEN SYSTEM SHOULD BE A HIGH

02:32:19.396 --> 02:32:21.365
PRIORITY THE REALITY IS THERE'S

02:32:21.432 --> 02:32:23.634
BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT.

02:32:23.701 --> 02:32:25.102
ON THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND SO

02:32:25.169 --> 02:32:28.272
WHY ARE THERE ON THESE DISTRICTS --

02:32:28.339 --> 02:32:30.608
WHAT IS ALSO COMMON IN EACH OF

02:32:30.674 --> 02:32:31.976
THESE PROBLEM AREAS?

02:32:32.042 --> 02:32:35.112
IS SLOW TO RESPOND --

02:32:35.179 --> 02:32:37.081
GOVERNANCE ISSUES.

02:32:37.147 --> 02:32:38.949
LEADERSHIP ISSUES SOME CASES

02:32:39.016 --> 02:32:40.851
TURN OVER A VERY SENIOR

02:32:40.918 --> 02:32:42.486
LEADERSHIP BULL SUPERINTENDENT

02:32:42.553 --> 02:32:44.688
BUSINESS OFFICE CAPACITY OF THE

02:32:44.755 --> 02:32:46.790
BUSINESS OFFICE IN MANY OF THESE

02:32:46.857 --> 02:32:47.391
CASES.

02:32:47.458 --> 02:32:51.061
ARM IN OUR EARTH IN TH OUR THREE

02:32:51.128 --> 02:32:53.297
NEGATIVES OTHER THAN I'M I'M FOR

02:32:53.364 --> 02:32:54.932
THE SAKE OF DISCUSSION WOULD.

02:32:54.999 --> 02:32:56.834
IGNORE FEATHER FALLS --

02:32:56.901 --> 02:32:59.036
SACRAMENTO CITY SOUTHERN KERN.

02:32:59.103 --> 02:33:02.239
AND SWEET WATER THOSE ARE ALL --

02:33:02.306 --> 02:33:04.708
LOW CAPACITY --

02:33:04.775 --> 02:33:07.711
BUSINESS OFFICE FUNCTIONS ARE UP

02:33:07.778 --> 02:33:08.979
TO THIS POINT.

02:33:09.046 --> 02:33:10.281
IN THE CASE OF SWEET WATER

02:33:10.347 --> 02:33:12.016
THEY'VE HIRED A VERY --

02:33:12.082 --> 02:33:13.484
HIGH CAPACITY PERSON TO LEAD

02:33:13.551 --> 02:33:16.020
THEIR BUSINESS FUNCTIONS --

02:33:16.086 --> 02:33:18.622
BUT IN THE OTHER DISH GO WITH

02:33:18.689 --> 02:33:20.758
CAPACITY OF THAT LEADERSHIP

02:33:20.824 --> 02:33:24.562
SPECIFICALLY YEAH SO AS FAR AS I

02:33:24.628 --> 02:33:26.363
KNOW IT'S HARD TO PREDICT.

02:33:26.430 --> 02:33:27.898
BUT IF WE SEE THAT YOU KNOW

02:33:27.965 --> 02:33:29.633
WE'VE HAD A INCREASE IN SCHOOL

02:33:29.700 --> 02:33:32.369
FUNDING FROM THE STATE THE LAST

02:33:32.436 --> 02:33:34.305
FIVE YEARS KIND LIKE THIS.

02:33:34.371 --> 02:33:36.473
IN THIS YEAR SOMEWHAT.

02:33:36.540 --> 02:33:38.242
YELLOWING SLOWING AND THEN LET'S

02:33:38.309 --> 02:33:39.376
SAVE IT SLOWS YOUR SLOWS EVEN

02:33:39.443 --> 02:33:41.312
MORE.

02:33:41.378 --> 02:33:42.880
DO YOU ANTICIPATE.

02:33:42.947 --> 02:33:44.848
A YEAR FROM NOW THAT THESE

02:33:44.915 --> 02:33:46.150
CHARTS AND BE.

02:33:46.216 --> 02:33:47.518
COMING OFF THE CHARTS.

02:33:47.585 --> 02:33:48.919
AND I I KNOW IT IS HARD TO

02:33:48.986 --> 02:33:50.120
PREDICT AND YOU GUYS YOU SAID

02:33:50.187 --> 02:33:52.323
SACRAMENTO WAS EVEN ON THE LIST.

02:33:52.389 --> 02:33:54.458
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO.

02:33:54.525 --> 02:33:56.226
YEP ONE OF THE CERTAINLY

02:33:56.293 --> 02:33:56.860
EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO SACRAMENTO

02:33:56.927 --> 02:33:58.228
WAS ON THE LIST THEY HAD A VERY

02:33:58.295 --> 02:34:01.098
HEALTHY RESERVE AND CASH

02:34:01.165 --> 02:34:03.067
FORECAST --

02:34:03.133 --> 02:34:04.234
BUT EVEN A YEAR AGO --

02:34:04.301 --> 02:34:06.770
AFTER MULTIPLE WARNINGS IN SACKS

02:34:06.837 --> 02:34:08.906
CITY THEY WEREN'T ON THE LIST

02:34:08.973 --> 02:34:09.540
THIS PUTS ACT WHEN OKAY SAYING

02:34:09.607 --> 02:34:12.009
SO DO YOU ANTICIPATE THAT AS

02:34:12.076 --> 02:34:13.911
WERE -- YES

02:34:13.978 --> 02:34:14.545
DIDN'T INVESTING IN OUR SCHOOLS

02:34:14.612 --> 02:34:16.213
AND NOT AS MUCH AS WE HAD BEEN

02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:17.514
THE PRIOR FOR YEARS.

02:34:17.581 --> 02:34:19.083
SO IT WE WOULD SAY WE WILL SEE A

02:34:19.149 --> 02:34:20.784
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OTHER

02:34:20.851 --> 02:34:24.254
DISTRICTS ON THE THE ON THE

02:34:24.321 --> 02:34:25.789
NEGATIVE ARE QUALIFIED.

02:34:25.856 --> 02:34:27.024
THERE WILL BE CHORE PRESSURE

02:34:27.091 --> 02:34:28.459
POINTS AS REVENUE SLOWS AND

02:34:28.525 --> 02:34:30.594
EXPENSES DON'T SLOW IN CONCERT

02:34:30.661 --> 02:34:32.363
WITH THAT THAT SAME REVENUE

02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:33.430
SLOWING RIGHT.

02:34:33.497 --> 02:34:37.134
ARM THAT SPEAKS TO THE IMPORTANT

02:34:37.201 --> 02:34:39.436
BACK TO STIRS ON PROVIDING SOME

02:34:39.503 --> 02:34:41.538
RELIEF THERE AT ONE OF THOSE

02:34:41.605 --> 02:34:43.207
PRESSURE POINTS AND SO ON AS

02:34:43.273 --> 02:34:44.508
NOTED IN MY COMMENTS UNDER

02:34:44.575 --> 02:34:45.976
SOLVENCY TRENDS WE ARE SEEN

02:34:46.043 --> 02:34:47.077
MULTI YEAR.

02:34:47.144 --> 02:34:49.680
FORECAST THAT SHOW DEFICIT TRANS

02:34:49.747 --> 02:34:51.649
MOST DEFINITELY THE MAJORITY OF

02:34:51.715 --> 02:34:53.150
SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

02:34:53.217 --> 02:34:54.351
THIS IS THE VALUE OF THE MULTI

02:34:54.418 --> 02:34:56.754
YOUR FINANCIAL PROJECTION THE

02:34:56.820 --> 02:34:58.555
AND SHOULDN'T AND AND SHOULDN'T

02:34:58.622 --> 02:34:59.923
BE DISCARDED --

02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:01.525
BY GOVERNING BOARDS OF THE

02:35:01.592 --> 02:35:03.961
IMPORTANCE OF THIS IT SHOWS THEM

02:35:04.028 --> 02:35:06.230
UNDER CURRENT LAW AND CURRENT

02:35:06.296 --> 02:35:07.798
FORECAST WHERE THEY'RE HEADED.

02:35:07.865 --> 02:35:09.700
AND SO NOW IS THE TIME TO TAKE

02:35:09.767 --> 02:35:11.001
THAT ACTION --

02:35:11.068 --> 02:35:12.870
TAKING ACTION EARLY MEANS THAT

02:35:12.936 --> 02:35:14.138
THEY PREVENT THOSE.

02:35:14.204 --> 02:35:16.940
THOSE KINDS OF DISTRESS.

02:35:17.007 --> 02:35:19.243
AND PRESSURE POINTS --

02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:21.211
IT IS.

02:35:21.278 --> 02:35:22.680
AGAIN I MUST SAY IT'S A

02:35:22.746 --> 02:35:23.414
FIDUCIARY THE RIVER BURE SPOTS

02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:23.981
ABILITY OF THE LOCAL SCHOOL

02:35:24.048 --> 02:35:26.417
BOARDS. TO INSURE THAT THEY LIVE

02:35:26.483 --> 02:35:27.985
WITHIN THEIR MEANS --

02:35:28.052 --> 02:35:29.720
AND THAT THEY SET THE PRIORITIES

02:35:29.787 --> 02:35:31.822
FOR THEIR DISTRICTS AS THEY MOVE

02:35:31.889 --> 02:35:33.524
FORWARD THAT ARE WITHIN THEIR

02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:36.160
THEIR FORECASTED REVENUE MEANS

02:35:36.226 --> 02:35:37.528
OR REPORTER RESERVE MEANS.

02:35:37.594 --> 02:35:39.063
AND THAT COURSE IS EXHIBIT A

02:35:39.129 --> 02:35:40.497
HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND AND BY

02:35:40.564 --> 02:35:41.932
THE WAY I I'M COUNTING ON OUR

02:35:41.999 --> 02:35:45.335
SCHOOL DISTRICT. TO TO TO MAKE

02:35:45.402 --> 02:35:47.671
THE ADJUSTMENTS AND AVOID GOING

02:35:47.738 --> 02:35:51.642
TO THE STATE TAKEOVER TAKING --

02:35:51.709 --> 02:35:53.410
ACTIONS LITTLE LITTLE BY LITTLE

02:35:53.477 --> 02:35:54.745
CHIPPING AWAY.

02:35:54.812 --> 02:35:56.647
BUT IT'S YET TO BE SEEN BUT

02:35:56.714 --> 02:35:57.781
WE'RE CERTAINLY COUNTING ON AS

02:35:57.848 --> 02:35:59.116
YOU KNOW OUR ADVICE TO THEM HAS

02:35:59.183 --> 02:36:00.651
BEEN DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO

02:36:00.718 --> 02:36:01.952
AVOID --

02:36:02.019 --> 02:36:04.988
COMING TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR A

02:36:05.055 --> 02:36:06.924
EMERGENCY PREPARATION SO SO WITH

02:36:06.990 --> 02:36:08.325
SACRAMENTO.

02:36:08.392 --> 02:36:10.194
IT EAT IT THERE WAS A

02:36:10.260 --> 02:36:12.162
PRECIPITOUS DECLINE.

02:36:12.229 --> 02:36:13.397
AS YOU AS YOU KNOW JUST AND THEY

02:36:13.464 --> 02:36:15.766
WERE ON THE THE POSITIVE.

02:36:15.833 --> 02:36:19.870
LEISURE THE REMAIN ON THAT DATE

02:36:19.937 --> 02:36:21.538
YELLOWER READ.

02:36:21.605 --> 02:36:23.107
FAR AS YOUR ON THE CHART.

02:36:23.173 --> 02:36:23.907
HAVE WE SEEN THAT BEFORE OTHER

02:36:23.974 --> 02:36:25.809
DISTRICTS IN SUCH A SHORT PERIOD

02:36:25.876 --> 02:36:26.243
OF TIME.

02:36:26.310 --> 02:36:29.580
GOING FROM POSITIVE TO QUALIFIED

02:36:29.646 --> 02:36:32.015
TO NEGATIVE YES SO ALSO ON THE

02:36:32.082 --> 02:36:34.151
NEGATIVE LISTA SWEETWATER THAT

02:36:34.218 --> 02:36:35.753
WAS AN OVERNIGHT --

02:36:35.819 --> 02:36:37.454
ISSUE YEAH THAT WAS BROUGHT

02:36:37.521 --> 02:36:38.956
RIGHT -- I

02:36:39.022 --> 02:36:40.758
WOULDN'T DESCRIBE IT AS FRAUD --

02:36:40.824 --> 02:36:43.193
WE MAY HAVE HAD --

02:36:43.260 --> 02:36:46.430
SOME ACTIVITY THAT DIDN'T SURE --

02:36:46.497 --> 02:36:48.165
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY

02:36:48.232 --> 02:36:50.067
EVIDENCE THAT SOMEBODY WALKED

02:36:50.134 --> 02:36:51.668
OUT THE DOOR WITH YEAH FUNDS I

02:36:51.735 --> 02:36:53.704
WOULD ROSY THAT DEFINITION --

02:36:53.771 --> 02:36:55.539
GROSS MISMANAGEMENT SACRAMENTO

02:36:55.606 --> 02:36:57.207
WASN'T WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S

02:36:57.274 --> 02:36:58.242
THE CASE YET BUT IT.

02:36:58.308 --> 02:37:01.078
DID WE EVER SEE A DISTRICT GO SO

02:37:01.145 --> 02:37:02.179
FAST.

02:37:02.246 --> 02:37:04.381
FROM GOOD NEWS --

02:37:04.448 --> 02:37:06.016
TO TO TO NEGATIVE SO QUICKLY YES --

02:37:06.083 --> 02:37:07.151
I THINK THERE ARE PROBABLY A

02:37:07.217 --> 02:37:09.119
NUMBER OF EXAMPLES IN HISTORY

02:37:09.186 --> 02:37:10.888
THAT SHOW THAT WE WE DON'T

02:37:10.954 --> 02:37:11.855
ALWAYS SEE THEM MOVE FROM

02:37:11.922 --> 02:37:13.857
POSITIVE NAY GAVE THE AB TWELVE

02:37:13.924 --> 02:37:14.658
HUNDRED PROCESS IS.

02:37:14.725 --> 02:37:16.326
DESIGNED TO BE A PROGRESSIVE

02:37:16.393 --> 02:37:19.229
SYSTEM SO BABY STEPS TOWARDS

02:37:19.296 --> 02:37:21.298
THAT AND SO THERE'S A RELUCTANCE

02:37:21.365 --> 02:37:23.133
FIRM -- FOR

02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:25.002
EVERYBODY TO GO FROM A

02:37:25.068 --> 02:37:26.103
CERTIFICATION POSITIVE TO

02:37:26.170 --> 02:37:27.171
CERTIFICATION OF NEGATIVE

02:37:27.237 --> 02:37:29.072
OVERNIGHT IT'S MEANT TO KIND OF

02:37:29.139 --> 02:37:30.507
BUILD UP TO THAT AND THE

02:37:30.574 --> 02:37:32.075
INTERVENTION THAT COMES WITHOUT.

02:37:32.142 --> 02:37:33.477
IS MEANT TO BE A BABY STEPS MUCH

02:37:33.544 --> 02:37:34.912
LIKE WHAT WE DO WITH THE STUDENT

02:37:34.978 --> 02:37:36.780
IN A CLASSROOM THROUGH A MULTI

02:37:36.847 --> 02:37:38.382
TIERED SYSTEM OF SUPPORT --

02:37:38.448 --> 02:37:39.683
WE PROVIDE JUST THE RIGHT

02:37:39.750 --> 02:37:42.719
INTERVENTION AT THE RIGHT TIME --

02:37:42.786 --> 02:37:44.555
BUT YES --

02:37:44.621 --> 02:37:46.523
SMALL DISTRICTS WITH A CHARTER

02:37:46.590 --> 02:37:47.791
THAT'S OPENING.

02:37:47.858 --> 02:37:49.660
WHAT WHAT LET ME GIVE YOU

02:37:49.726 --> 02:37:52.262
ANOTHER EXAMPLE ON ON BEEN

02:37:52.329 --> 02:37:54.031
BEFORE YOU BEFORE IS VALLEJO

02:37:54.097 --> 02:37:55.532
CITY -- THEY

02:37:55.599 --> 02:37:57.401
HAD A DEFICIT --

02:37:57.467 --> 02:37:58.735
IN THE CURRENT.

02:37:58.802 --> 02:38:00.904
IN THE CURRENT PERIOD --

02:38:00.971 --> 02:38:02.773
THAT WAS FAIRLY MANAGEABLE --

02:38:02.840 --> 02:38:05.075
THEY HAD A VERY LARGE.

02:38:05.142 --> 02:38:08.011
ARE A CHARTER SCHOOL OPEN WITH --

02:38:08.078 --> 02:38:10.013
IF I RECALL RIGHT --

02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:12.149
ROUGHLY SEVEN HUNDRED STUDENT

02:38:12.216 --> 02:38:12.950
DECLINE --

02:38:13.016 --> 02:38:15.285
AS OUR BUT IN THEDISTRICT AS A

02:38:15.352 --> 02:38:17.054
RESULT OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL ON

02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:18.088
MORE THAN.

02:38:18.155 --> 02:38:20.691
MORE THAN DOUBLES THEIR DEFICIT

02:38:20.757 --> 02:38:22.559
ALMOST OVERNIGHT.

02:38:22.626 --> 02:38:24.761
AND SO THAT WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE.

02:38:24.828 --> 02:38:27.297
OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT PARADISE

02:38:27.364 --> 02:38:28.732
MY LAST QUESTION WOULD BE IN A

02:38:28.799 --> 02:38:31.835
BIT EXTREME SITUATION RIGHT BUT

02:38:31.902 --> 02:38:34.071
WITH THE WITH THE FIRES --

02:38:34.137 --> 02:38:36.240
BUT PARADISE IS CURRENTLY

02:38:36.306 --> 02:38:37.441
OPERATING AT HALF OF ITS

02:38:37.507 --> 02:38:39.142
ENROLLMENT THAT IT HAD JUST IN

02:38:39.209 --> 02:38:41.245
OCTOBER --

02:38:41.311 --> 02:38:43.647
FORECASTED GO DOWN ANOTHER THIRD

02:38:43.714 --> 02:38:45.782
IN OF THE NEW SCHOOL YEAR SO

02:38:45.849 --> 02:38:47.784
THEY'LL BE ON THIS LIST.

02:38:47.851 --> 02:38:48.919
IT DEPENDING ON THE

02:38:48.986 --> 02:38:50.554
LEGISLATURE'S ACTION WITH

02:38:50.621 --> 02:38:51.688
RESPECT --

02:38:51.755 --> 02:38:53.657
TO ASSISTANCE FOR THEM UNIQUELY

02:38:53.724 --> 02:38:55.025
BECAUSE OF THEIR THE NATURAL

02:38:55.092 --> 02:38:55.893
DISASTER --

02:38:55.959 --> 02:38:58.195
THE THE FIRE MY LAST QUESTION --

02:38:58.262 --> 02:38:59.696
WE HAVE FEW MEMBERS HERE WHEN I

02:38:59.763 --> 02:39:00.964
GOT A JOB IN.

02:39:01.031 --> 02:39:02.366
IS YOU WE HAVE.

02:39:02.432 --> 02:39:04.368
CHANGED THEIR THE RULES IN THESE

02:39:04.434 --> 02:39:05.636
DISTRESSED DISTRICTS OF COURSE

02:39:05.702 --> 02:39:06.970
YOU ALLUDED TO THAT NOW WITH THE

02:39:07.037 --> 02:39:08.272
COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AS A

02:39:08.338 --> 02:39:10.374
AS A STRONGER ROLE IN WE HAVE

02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:10.607
THESE.

02:39:10.674 --> 02:39:14.111
IDENTIFYING POINTS BUT SON

02:39:14.177 --> 02:39:15.679
DISTRICTS DID SLEPT.

02:39:15.746 --> 02:39:17.915
OVERNIGHT ROUGH YOU KNOW TO THIS

02:39:17.981 --> 02:39:20.284
SO I GUESS --

02:39:20.350 --> 02:39:21.752
MY QUESTION TO YOU IS.

02:39:21.818 --> 02:39:22.986
IS IT IS THE CURRENT SYSTEM

02:39:23.053 --> 02:39:25.322
ADEQUATE HER TO BE LOOKING AT AT

02:39:25.389 --> 02:39:27.557
THAT OTHER WAYS TO MAKE SURE

02:39:27.624 --> 02:39:30.427
THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY THESE EARLY

02:39:30.494 --> 02:39:32.763
WARNING SIGNS AND AND YOU KNOW

02:39:32.829 --> 02:39:34.464
KIND OF BLOW THE WHISTLE.

02:39:34.531 --> 02:39:36.867
AND AND MAKE SURE THAT SCHOOL

02:39:36.934 --> 02:39:38.001
DISTRICTS ON THEIR ELECTED

02:39:38.068 --> 02:39:38.969
LEADERSHIP AND THEIR

02:39:39.036 --> 02:39:40.637
SUPERINTENDENTS ARE AWARE AND

02:39:40.704 --> 02:39:42.205
MAKING THESE DECISIONS EARLIER

02:39:42.272 --> 02:39:43.440
SO WE DON'T HAVE.

02:39:43.507 --> 02:39:44.775
YOU KNOW THESE CATASTROPHES

02:39:44.841 --> 02:39:46.243
IMPACTING OUR CLASSROOMS GAS IN

02:39:46.310 --> 02:39:49.846
A DAY WHO GETS HURT THE MOST.

02:39:49.913 --> 02:39:50.981
CLASSROOMS YOUR KIDS.

02:39:51.048 --> 02:39:52.182
STUDENTS ARE LEARNING WHICH IS

02:39:52.249 --> 02:39:54.318
YOU KNOW OUR TOP PRIORITY FOR A

02:39:54.384 --> 02:39:55.819
STATE SO.

02:39:55.886 --> 02:39:57.054
OUR IS THE CURRENT SYSTEMATIC

02:39:57.120 --> 02:39:58.255
WITH OR DO ANYTHING I THINK IT

02:39:58.322 --> 02:39:59.589
OTHER OTHER WAYS THE CURRENT

02:39:59.656 --> 02:40:01.458
SYSTEM WORKS VERY WELL THAT

02:40:01.525 --> 02:40:02.993
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S PERFECT THERE

02:40:03.060 --> 02:40:04.394
ARE TWO WEEKS IT CAN BE MADE TO

02:40:04.461 --> 02:40:06.196
IT AND THAT'S IN PART WHY WE'VE

02:40:06.263 --> 02:40:07.164
SEEN SOME FORTY PIECES OF

02:40:07.230 --> 02:40:09.466
LEGISLATION SINCE NINETEEN

02:40:09.533 --> 02:40:09.833
NINETY ONE WHEN.

02:40:09.900 --> 02:40:10.867
AB TWELVE WONDER WAS PUT IN

02:40:10.934 --> 02:40:12.836
PLACE TO DO THIS FIND TWEAKS IN

02:40:12.903 --> 02:40:14.871
EACH OF THOSE DRIVEN BY

02:40:14.938 --> 02:40:17.341
EXPERIENCE ALONG THE WAY --

02:40:17.407 --> 02:40:19.710
ARE THERE SOME TWEAKS AROUND --

02:40:19.776 --> 02:40:21.912
THE REPORTING AND THE COUNTY'S

02:40:21.979 --> 02:40:25.282
ROLE WITH RESPECT --

02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:25.782
TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

02:40:25.849 --> 02:40:29.453
AGREEMENTS GREEN MEANT BUT THE

02:40:29.519 --> 02:40:31.755
REPORTING OF THE THE DATA AND

02:40:31.822 --> 02:40:33.390
THE COUNTIES ON THE TIME LINES

02:40:33.457 --> 02:40:34.591
RELATIVE TO THAT.

02:40:34.658 --> 02:40:36.159
STRENGTHENING THAT AREA --

02:40:36.226 --> 02:40:37.494
I THINK PROBABLY WOULD BE

02:40:37.561 --> 02:40:38.829
HELPFUL TO THE SYSTEM.

02:40:38.895 --> 02:40:40.964
AGAIN NOT INFRINGING UPON A

02:40:41.031 --> 02:40:43.266
LOCAL BOARD IN ITS IN ITS LABOR

02:40:43.333 --> 02:40:44.768
PARTNERS TO ENTER INTO AN

02:40:44.835 --> 02:40:46.737
AGREEMENT --

02:40:46.803 --> 02:40:49.039
I WOULD I WOULD DISCUSS WE ARE

02:40:49.106 --> 02:40:50.507
HARD PRESSED --

02:40:50.574 --> 02:40:53.176
TO CRITICIZE ACTUALLY ANY OF THE

02:40:53.243 --> 02:40:54.644
LABOR AGREEMENTS THAT SOME FOLKS

02:40:54.711 --> 02:40:57.247
WOULD POINT TO AS THE CAUSE FOR

02:40:57.314 --> 02:40:58.448
SOME OF THESE BECAUSE THOSE MAY

02:40:58.515 --> 02:41:00.317
HAVE BEEN PERFECT AGREEMENTS FOR

02:41:00.384 --> 02:41:02.819
THAT DISTRICT. FOR ITS --

02:41:02.886 --> 02:41:04.554
INSTRUCTIONAL MISSION --

02:41:04.621 --> 02:41:06.323
IT'S TEACHERS WHICH ARE CRITICAL

02:41:06.390 --> 02:41:07.824
TO THAT MISSION --

02:41:07.891 --> 02:41:09.559
HOWEVER THE DISTRICT AND DIDN'T

02:41:09.626 --> 02:41:11.695
RESPOND AFTER THAT TO THE

02:41:11.762 --> 02:41:13.163
CHANGES THAT THEY NEEDED TO MAKE

02:41:13.230 --> 02:41:15.799
CAN SO THE COUNTY SPECIFIC ROLE

02:41:15.866 --> 02:41:17.968
ON WITH REGARD TO THAT.

02:41:18.035 --> 02:41:20.137
A FOCUS ON ON THE COUNTIES

02:41:20.203 --> 02:41:23.106
EVALUATION OVER THE LIFE OF AN

02:41:23.173 --> 02:41:26.143
AGREEMENT AS OPPOSED TO TO ONLY

02:41:26.209 --> 02:41:28.879
FOCUSING ON THE CURRENT YEAR

02:41:28.945 --> 02:41:29.780
PLUS TWO YEARS.

02:41:29.846 --> 02:41:30.714
SO IF A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

02:41:30.781 --> 02:41:32.382
AGREEMENT GOES OUT FOUR YEARS OR

02:41:32.449 --> 02:41:33.850
FIVE YEARS WHICH IS.

02:41:33.917 --> 02:41:36.086
PRETTY RARE THAT IT GOES OUT

02:41:36.153 --> 02:41:37.821
THAT FAR BUT IF IT DOES --

02:41:37.888 --> 02:41:38.655
TO LOOK AT THE LIFE OF THE

02:41:38.722 --> 02:41:39.723
AGREEMENT THE CODE ALREADY

02:41:39.790 --> 02:41:42.325
PROVIDES FOR THAT BUT THAT'S NOT --

02:41:42.392 --> 02:41:43.827
THAT IS NOT THE NORMAL PRACTICE

02:41:43.894 --> 02:41:45.729
IT'S EVERYTHING IN IN SCHOOL

02:41:45.796 --> 02:41:49.733
FINANCE FOCUSES ON CURRENT PLUS --

02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:50.333
TO SYSTEM STRENGTHENING THEIR

02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:52.536
THOSE WOULD BE TO THE SYSTEM

02:41:52.602 --> 02:41:54.404
DOES WORK I THINK THE BEST

02:41:54.471 --> 02:41:55.806
EVIDENCE OF THAT.

02:41:55.872 --> 02:41:58.875
IS THAT WE IN TWENTY SEVEN

02:41:58.942 --> 02:42:00.010
TWENTY EIGHT YEARS SINCE AB

02:42:00.077 --> 02:42:01.011
TWELVE HUNDRED WAS PASSED.

02:42:01.078 --> 02:42:04.548
WE'VE HAD. NINE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:42:04.614 --> 02:42:06.650
OF ONE COMMUNITY COLLEGE COME TO

02:42:06.716 --> 02:42:07.584
THE LEGISLATURE FOR EMERGENCY

02:42:07.651 --> 02:42:09.052
PREPARATION.

02:42:09.119 --> 02:42:10.387
WE HAVE ELEVEN HUNDRED PLUS

02:42:10.454 --> 02:42:12.422
ANOTHER HUNDRED AND TWELVE OR SO

02:42:12.489 --> 02:42:14.891
COMMUNITY COLLEGES SEVENTY SOME

02:42:14.958 --> 02:42:16.760
COMMITTEE COLLEGE DISTRICTS --

02:42:16.827 --> 02:42:18.295
THAT GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS

02:42:18.361 --> 02:42:20.730
EVERY YEAR RIGHT AND WE'RE ONLY

02:42:20.797 --> 02:42:22.466
TALKING ABOUT JUST TRULY A

02:42:22.532 --> 02:42:24.968
HANDFUL THAT HAVE WERE THE

02:42:25.035 --> 02:42:26.369
PROPER OVERSIGHT THE PROPER

02:42:26.436 --> 02:42:28.405
INTERVENTION --

02:42:28.472 --> 02:42:29.906
THAT THE DISTRICT ULTIMATELY

02:42:29.973 --> 02:42:32.109
WASN'T RESPONSIVE TO THAT OKAY

02:42:32.175 --> 02:42:34.978
THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER LIMA.

02:42:35.045 --> 02:42:36.480
THANK YOU AND IT.

02:42:38.081 --> 02:42:38.682
CUT THE QUESTIONS THAT I'VE BEEN

02:42:38.748 --> 02:42:39.850
ASKED TO THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

02:42:39.916 --> 02:42:41.451
I'M LOOKING AT TO USE THE CHART

02:42:41.518 --> 02:42:43.153
THAT AND WE'VE SEEN BEFORE.

02:42:43.220 --> 02:42:44.287
BUT THAT --

02:42:44.354 --> 02:42:45.989
YOU KNOW THINKING OF THIRTY NINE

02:42:46.056 --> 02:42:47.324
THAT ARE QUALIFIED RIGHT NOW AND

02:42:47.390 --> 02:42:48.558
WHERE WE WERE PRIOR TO THE

02:42:48.625 --> 02:42:50.026
RECESSION AND KNOWING AND THEN

02:42:50.093 --> 02:42:51.761
THE NEXT THREE TO FOUR YEARS --

02:42:51.828 --> 02:42:52.729
WE MAY FIND OURSELVES IN SOME

02:42:52.796 --> 02:42:55.198
DIFFICULTY I'M TRYING TO FOR

02:42:55.265 --> 02:42:59.236
PASSED ON WHAT.

02:42:59.302 --> 02:43:00.203
I MEAN HOW WECAN THINK ABOUT

02:43:00.270 --> 02:43:02.339
THIS THIRTY NINE DOESN'T SEEM

02:43:02.405 --> 02:43:03.874
LIKE A LOT COMPARED TO WHEN WE

02:43:03.940 --> 02:43:05.342
HAD A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX

02:43:05.408 --> 02:43:06.643
BUT CERTAINLY WE DON'T WANT A

02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:08.411
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX AT

02:43:08.478 --> 02:43:09.746
QUALIFIED --

02:43:09.813 --> 02:43:11.047
IN SO CAN YOU JUST HELP US

02:43:11.114 --> 02:43:12.415
FORECAST A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS

02:43:12.482 --> 02:43:13.583
OF WHAT WE SHOULD EXPECT THE

02:43:13.650 --> 02:43:15.051
NEXT THREE TO FOUR YEARS AND IF

02:43:15.118 --> 02:43:16.286
YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS.

02:43:16.353 --> 02:43:17.220
OUR RECOMMENDATIONS --

02:43:17.287 --> 02:43:21.892
UP ON TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WE

02:43:21.958 --> 02:43:24.461
DON'T GET TO WHERE WE WERE IN.

02:43:24.528 --> 02:43:25.061
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TWELVE SO

02:43:25.128 --> 02:43:25.929
MAY HAVE BEEN ON THE SCHOOL

02:43:25.996 --> 02:43:28.031
BOARD AT THAT TIME OKAY RIGHT SO

02:43:28.098 --> 02:43:29.099
I WILL NOTE THAT PORTABLE

02:43:29.166 --> 02:43:32.202
PERFECT EXAMPLE RIGHT --

02:43:32.269 --> 02:43:33.904
SO IF YOU YOU WERE REALLY TO

02:43:33.970 --> 02:43:36.173
PLOT OUT THIS THE ECONOMY IN THE

02:43:36.239 --> 02:43:37.674
STATE BUDGETS RESPONSE TO THE

02:43:37.741 --> 02:43:39.709
ECONOMY WITH RESPECT TO TAX

02:43:39.776 --> 02:43:41.144
INCOME --

02:43:41.211 --> 02:43:43.246
INCOME FROM TAXES AND SO ON THE

02:43:43.313 --> 02:43:45.182
QUALIFIED IS AN EBB AND FLOW

02:43:45.248 --> 02:43:48.552
THAT ALMOST MATCHES EXACTLY --

02:43:48.618 --> 02:43:49.686
GOOD BUDGET YEARS ABOUT BUDGET

02:43:49.753 --> 02:43:52.122
YEARS RIGHT THE PEAK OF ONE

02:43:52.189 --> 02:43:53.089
SEVENTY SIX WAS RIGHT SMACK IN

02:43:53.156 --> 02:43:53.823
THE MIDDLE OF THE GREAT

02:43:53.890 --> 02:43:54.758
RECESSION.

02:43:54.824 --> 02:43:56.259
IT WASN'T THE FIRST YEAR TOOK A

02:43:56.326 --> 02:43:58.395
FEW YEARS RIGHT IS DISTRICTS

02:43:58.461 --> 02:44:00.197
BEGAN TO SPEND DOWN THE RESERVES --

02:44:00.263 --> 02:44:02.265
AND AND IN AN ATTEMPT TO AVOID

02:44:02.332 --> 02:44:05.068
CUTS TO PROGRAMS AND LAYOFFS --

02:44:05.135 --> 02:44:07.837
TO OUR OUR PRECIOUS STAFF THAT

02:44:07.904 --> 02:44:10.207
THAT SERVER KIDS AND SO --

02:44:10.273 --> 02:44:12.642
THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE THAT PEAK

02:44:12.709 --> 02:44:14.544
ARE WE ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THAT NO

02:44:14.611 --> 02:44:16.780
WHILE REVENUES MAY BE SLOWING AT

02:44:16.846 --> 02:44:18.014
THE STATE --

02:44:18.081 --> 02:44:19.416
GOING FORWARD WE HAVE A FULL

02:44:19.482 --> 02:44:22.552
IMPLEMENTATION OF L. C. F. F. --

02:44:22.619 --> 02:44:24.921
AND SO WERE IN THIS COAL ONLY

02:44:24.988 --> 02:44:25.522
FOR LACK OF A BETTER WAY OF

02:44:25.589 --> 02:44:27.257
DESCRIBING IT ENVIRONMENT FOR

02:44:27.324 --> 02:44:28.658
YEAR OVER YEAR REVENUE GROWTH

02:44:28.725 --> 02:44:30.493
ASIDE FROM ANY ADDITIONAL

02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:32.128
PREPARATIONS AT THE STATE.

02:44:32.195 --> 02:44:33.830
OF THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN

02:44:33.897 --> 02:44:38.768
ADMINISTRATION MAY AGREE --

02:44:38.835 --> 02:44:39.903
TO THERE THERE'S GOING TO BE

02:44:39.970 --> 02:44:40.870
SOME PRESSURE POINTS COMING

02:44:40.937 --> 02:44:42.872
FORTH -- THE

02:44:42.939 --> 02:44:44.307
YEAR OVER YEAR REVENUE GROWTH

02:44:44.374 --> 02:44:45.742
FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS --

02:44:45.809 --> 02:44:47.744
WILL NOT MATCH THE YEAR OVER

02:44:47.811 --> 02:44:52.148
YEAR EXPENDITURE GROWTH IN --

02:44:52.215 --> 02:44:54.017
IN FOUR AREAS THAT DISTRICTS

02:44:54.084 --> 02:44:55.385
OFTEN SAY THEY DON'T HAVE

02:44:55.452 --> 02:44:56.686
CONTROL OVER.

02:44:56.753 --> 02:45:00.490
PENSIONS AND SO MAYBE THAT THE

02:45:00.557 --> 02:45:01.658
PERSIAN FOOD PUMP ON TOGETHER

02:45:01.725 --> 02:45:03.460
STEP IN COLUMN WHICH IS A

02:45:03.526 --> 02:45:04.995
NATURAL PROGRESSION OBVIOUSLY OF

02:45:05.061 --> 02:45:06.630
AN EMPLOYEE --

02:45:06.696 --> 02:45:08.865
BASED ON TIME IN EDUCATION --

02:45:08.932 --> 02:45:12.502
IN THE DISTRICT AND BUT

02:45:12.569 --> 02:45:14.804
CONTRIBUTIONS TO SPECIAL ED --

02:45:14.871 --> 02:45:16.506
REMEMBER THAT --

02:45:16.573 --> 02:45:18.375
SPECIAL ED EXPENSES ARE

02:45:18.441 --> 02:45:20.210
INFLUENCED GREATLY NOT ONLY BY

02:45:20.277 --> 02:45:21.745
THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS BUT ALSO

02:45:21.811 --> 02:45:22.946
EVERY TIME THAT WE HAVE A

02:45:23.013 --> 02:45:24.214
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING.

02:45:24.281 --> 02:45:27.550
SETTLEMENT THAT IS BASED ON AT

02:45:27.617 --> 02:45:29.119
LEAST AS THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS

02:45:29.185 --> 02:45:32.722
BEEN BASED ON A COMBINATION OF

02:45:32.789 --> 02:45:34.024
COLA AND GAP FUNDING.

02:45:34.090 --> 02:45:34.624
SPECIAL ED DIDN'T RECEIVE THE

02:45:34.691 --> 02:45:36.126
GAP FUNDING RIGHT IT RECEIVED

02:45:36.192 --> 02:45:37.027
COLA.

02:45:37.093 --> 02:45:38.094
BUT NOT A SAID THE HAPPENINGS

02:45:38.161 --> 02:45:39.729
THAT IMMEDIATELY --

02:45:39.796 --> 02:45:42.299
PUT SPECIAL ED EXPENDITURES AND

02:45:42.365 --> 02:45:44.067
REVENUES OUT OF SYNC THE OTHER

02:45:44.134 --> 02:45:45.835
ISSUE THAT YOU HAVE IS AS WE

02:45:45.902 --> 02:45:48.338
HAVE ABOUT 65% OF THE DISTRICTS

02:45:48.405 --> 02:45:49.105
ACROSS THE STATE DECLINING

02:45:49.172 --> 02:45:50.273
ENROLLMENT.

02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:52.042
SB SIX SO --

02:45:52.108 --> 02:45:53.743
TO WHICH IS SPECIAL STATE MASTER

02:45:53.810 --> 02:45:56.212
PLAN SPECIAL ED FUNDING --

02:45:56.279 --> 02:45:58.982
IS ALLOCATED BASED ON TOTAL AND

02:45:59.049 --> 02:46:00.984
BE DROPPING --

02:46:01.051 --> 02:46:02.319
IN IN WIDE.

02:46:02.385 --> 02:46:04.287
SORRY IN WHITE AREAS ACROSS THE

02:46:04.354 --> 02:46:06.056
STATE -- A

02:46:06.122 --> 02:46:07.223
AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE

02:46:07.290 --> 02:46:08.591
ENROLLMENT SPECIAL IT IS

02:46:08.658 --> 02:46:10.193
INCREASING RIGHT --

02:46:10.260 --> 02:46:12.862
THAT'S NOT THE THAT'S NOT THE

02:46:12.929 --> 02:46:15.632
SUBGROUP FOR LACK OF BETTER TERM

02:46:15.699 --> 02:46:16.566
THAT IS NOT OF IN TOTAL

02:46:16.633 --> 02:46:18.234
ENROLLMENT THAT'S DROPPING SO

02:46:18.301 --> 02:46:19.102
THOSE COULD DOES CREATE SOME

02:46:19.169 --> 02:46:20.503
CONFLICTS IN CERTAINLY THE

02:46:20.570 --> 02:46:21.705
GOVERNOR --

02:46:21.771 --> 02:46:23.640
IN HIS JANUARY PROPOSAL BEGINS

02:46:23.707 --> 02:46:25.375
TO LOOK AT SOME OF THAT --

02:46:25.442 --> 02:46:26.943
AND SPEAK TO SOME OF THAT WITH

02:46:27.010 --> 02:46:29.546
RESPECT TO SOME SOME ADDITIONAL

02:46:29.612 --> 02:46:31.481
RESOURCES SHORTLY --

02:46:31.548 --> 02:46:33.350
SUBLIMINAL DONALD'S BOMB ON

02:46:33.416 --> 02:46:34.951
CHAIRED A COMMITTEE AND HAD A

02:46:35.018 --> 02:46:36.619
NUMBER PROPOSALS IN IN THE AREA

02:46:36.686 --> 02:46:38.588
OF SPECIAL ED --

02:46:38.655 --> 02:46:40.523
IN IN THE PAST --

02:46:40.590 --> 02:46:44.661
EIGHTEEN MONTHS TWO YEARS REALLY --

02:46:44.728 --> 02:46:45.395
AND SO.

02:46:45.462 --> 02:46:46.162
THOSE ARE ALL GOING TO BE

02:46:46.229 --> 02:46:47.497
PRESSURE POINTS THOSE WILL ALL

02:46:47.564 --> 02:46:49.699
INCREASE PROBLY.

02:46:49.766 --> 02:46:51.167
AT INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS --

02:46:51.234 --> 02:46:52.402
THOSE EXPENDITURE AREAS WILL

02:46:52.469 --> 02:46:54.604
INCREASE AT A HIGHER RATE THAN

02:46:54.671 --> 02:46:55.505
WHAT THE REVENUES GOING TO

02:46:55.572 --> 02:46:56.873
INCREASE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE

02:46:56.940 --> 02:46:58.241
YEARS THAT'S WHAT THIS.

02:46:58.308 --> 02:46:59.442
THAT'S WHAT THESE DEFICIT

02:46:59.509 --> 02:47:02.045
TRENDING MODELS ARE SHOWING US

02:47:02.112 --> 02:47:03.513
ON A DISTRICT BY DISTRICT.

02:47:03.580 --> 02:47:05.315
MOST DISTRICTS THEN WILL STEP UP

02:47:05.382 --> 02:47:07.283
AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN THEIR

02:47:07.350 --> 02:47:07.717
PRIORITIES AND THEIR

02:47:07.784 --> 02:47:08.918
EXPENDITURES --

02:47:08.985 --> 02:47:10.754
TO MEET THAT CHALLENGE AND THEY

02:47:10.820 --> 02:47:13.423
WILL HAVE BALLOTS BUDGETS --

02:47:13.490 --> 02:47:15.759
A FEW DISTRICTS WON'T DO THAT

02:47:15.825 --> 02:47:17.994
THEY'LL END UP INFLUENCING

02:47:18.061 --> 02:47:20.530
WHATEVER THE COUNTY IS HERE WE

02:47:20.597 --> 02:47:21.164
HOPE FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF

02:47:21.231 --> 02:47:23.099
TIME -- BUT

02:47:23.166 --> 02:47:24.734
CERTAINLY MAY BE LONGER PERIOD

02:47:24.801 --> 02:47:27.036
THAT IS WHY ONE OF THE TRIGGERS

02:47:27.103 --> 02:47:28.505
WE IDENTIFIED IN OUR PROACTIVE

02:47:28.571 --> 02:47:29.205
WORK.

02:47:29.272 --> 02:47:32.041
WAS THREE CONSECUTIVE QUALIFIED.

02:47:32.108 --> 02:47:33.376
IF YOU'RE SETTING IN THAT

02:47:33.443 --> 02:47:35.645
QUALIFIED AND YOU'RE NOT GETTING

02:47:35.712 --> 02:47:36.846
OFF THAT LIST IMPACT THE

02:47:36.913 --> 02:47:38.948
POSITIVE AFTER THREE WHICH IS

02:47:39.015 --> 02:47:40.216
ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF FIRST

02:47:40.283 --> 02:47:43.420
SECOND FOLLOWING FIRST ENRON OR

02:47:43.486 --> 02:47:45.054
SECOND FIRST SECOND.

02:47:45.121 --> 02:47:46.189
INTERIM --

02:47:46.256 --> 02:47:47.690
SO YEAR YEAR AND A HALF THE TIME

02:47:47.757 --> 02:47:49.092
IF YOU'RE NOT MOVING BACK IN

02:47:49.159 --> 02:47:50.960
THAT TIME PERIOD THEN WE WANT TO

02:47:51.027 --> 02:47:52.061
LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE

02:47:52.128 --> 02:47:53.363
DISTRICT AS PART OF THAT EARLY

02:47:53.430 --> 02:47:54.564
WARNING SYSTEM.

02:47:54.631 --> 02:47:57.066
AS A SUPPLEMENT TO WHAT ARE

02:47:57.133 --> 02:47:57.700
COUNTY OFFICES ARE ALREADY DOING

02:47:57.767 --> 02:47:58.001
[inaudible]

02:47:58.067 --> 02:48:01.171
THANK.

02:48:01.237 --> 02:48:03.173
OKAY MISTER DON.

02:48:03.239 --> 02:48:04.340
JUST A FOLLOW UP MAYBE RELATED

02:48:04.407 --> 02:48:08.945
TO THE THE SACRAMENTO SITUATION.

02:48:09.012 --> 02:48:10.980
AND WE HAVE DECLINING ENROLLMENT

02:48:11.047 --> 02:48:11.281
[inaudible]

02:48:11.347 --> 02:48:23.092
EXCUSE ME.

02:48:23.159 --> 02:48:23.393
QUINCY NO.

02:48:23.460 --> 02:48:24.394
HERE WE GO ALL RIGHT I WITH

02:48:24.461 --> 02:48:26.763
REGARD TO DECLINING ENROLLMENT

02:48:26.830 --> 02:48:29.499
AND CLOSING SCHOOL FACILITIES --

02:48:29.566 --> 02:48:30.633
YOURS LIBERAL POLITICAL VENTURE

02:48:30.700 --> 02:48:31.201
THERE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I'M

02:48:31.267 --> 02:48:34.003
SURE THAT'S THE BIGGEST HURDLE.

02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:37.240
TO CLOSING SCHOOLS BUT IS THERE.

02:48:37.307 --> 02:48:38.708
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO

02:48:38.775 --> 02:48:39.809
HAVE DISTRICTS TAKE A CLOSER

02:48:39.876 --> 02:48:41.311
LOOK.

02:48:41.377 --> 02:48:42.579
AT CLOSING THOSE SCHOOL

02:48:42.645 --> 02:48:44.347
FACILITIES THEY REALLY NEED TO

02:48:44.414 --> 02:48:46.282
CLOSE BECAUSE OF THE FISCAL

02:48:46.349 --> 02:48:50.687
IMPACT THEY MAY HAVE.

02:48:50.753 --> 02:48:52.522
WELL DIFFICULT DIFFICULT TOPIC

02:48:52.589 --> 02:48:54.324
DIFFICULT QUESTION IS A SCHOOL

02:48:54.390 --> 02:48:56.059
BOARD MEMBER OF THE LAST YOU

02:48:56.125 --> 02:48:57.494
WANT TO DO IS CLOSE A

02:48:57.560 --> 02:49:00.630
NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL CRISIS --

02:49:00.697 --> 02:49:02.165
SO LET'S BEGIN OUTLETS FOR THE

02:49:02.232 --> 02:49:03.500
RECORD I'M NOT ADVOCATE OKAY I

02:49:03.566 --> 02:49:05.268
WAS GOING TO CLOSE I WAS CERTAIN

02:49:05.335 --> 02:49:07.170
OF THAT BUT LET'S LET'S HAVE

02:49:07.237 --> 02:49:09.038
SOME CLARITY THOUGH. FOR SAKS

02:49:09.105 --> 02:49:11.007
CITY THEIR ENROLLMENT DECLINE IS

02:49:11.074 --> 02:49:14.844
A VERY VERY MINOR IT'S IN THE 1% --

02:49:14.911 --> 02:49:16.746
SO THAT'S NOT.

02:49:16.813 --> 02:49:21.117
FAIR THAT IS THERE AT JUST OVER

02:49:21.184 --> 02:49:21.684
FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN A

02:49:21.751 --> 02:49:23.953
PROJECT TO BUILD THEIR MOST

02:49:24.020 --> 02:49:25.722
RECENT HISTORY HAS BEEN ROUGHLY

02:49:25.788 --> 02:49:27.323
1% A YEAR --

02:49:27.390 --> 02:49:28.324
YES I'M AWARE OF A NEW

02:49:28.391 --> 02:49:30.460
PROJECTION JUST IN THE LAST

02:49:30.527 --> 02:49:31.895
MONTH OR SO THAT.

02:49:31.961 --> 02:49:33.830
THAT -- THAT

02:49:33.897 --> 02:49:35.164
THAT NUMBER IS HIGHER --

02:49:35.231 --> 02:49:36.466
CERTAINLY AWARE OF THAT FOR NEXT

02:49:36.533 --> 02:49:38.601
YEAR BUT CERTAINLY THEIR ACTUAL

02:49:38.668 --> 02:49:40.436
IS WHEN WE COMPARE YEAR TO YEAR.

02:49:40.503 --> 02:49:41.838
FOR THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS

02:49:41.905 --> 02:49:43.640
LEADING UP TO THIS YEAR IT'S

02:49:43.706 --> 02:49:45.341
BEEN JUST IT'S BEEN. ONE YEAR

02:49:45.408 --> 02:49:46.876
WAS A LITTLE HIGHER THAN 1% BUT

02:49:46.943 --> 02:49:49.445
ON AVERAGE BEEN ABOUT 1% --

02:49:49.512 --> 02:49:51.714
SO A BETTER EXAMPLE OF THAT

02:49:51.781 --> 02:49:54.684
WOULD BE INGLEWOOD IN OAKLAND.

02:49:54.751 --> 02:49:56.819
ARM INGLEWOOD IS DROPPED FROM

02:49:56.886 --> 02:49:59.222
SERVING ROUGHLY NINETEEN

02:49:59.289 --> 02:50:01.024
THOUSAND STUDENTS TO LESS THAN.

02:50:01.090 --> 02:50:02.091
EIGHT THOUSAND THEY HAVE SURPLUS

02:50:02.158 --> 02:50:04.427
SEATS SURPLUS CLASSROOMS SURPLUS

02:50:04.494 --> 02:50:05.728
SCHOOLS --

02:50:05.795 --> 02:50:07.864
IN EIGHTEEN FORTY THEY WERE

02:50:07.931 --> 02:50:09.132
REQUIRED TO ADDRESS THAT.

02:50:09.198 --> 02:50:11.301
A LOCAL PLAN TO ADDRESS THAT.

02:50:11.367 --> 02:50:13.002
IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS THEY

02:50:13.069 --> 02:50:15.171
HAVE TAKEN.

02:50:15.238 --> 02:50:17.173
AFTER YEARS OF CONVERSATION --

02:50:17.240 --> 02:50:18.107
IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS

02:50:18.174 --> 02:50:19.776
THEY'VE PUT TOGETHER A VERY

02:50:19.842 --> 02:50:21.044
VIABLE PLAN.

02:50:21.110 --> 02:50:22.178
ON TO ADDRESS THAT --

02:50:22.245 --> 02:50:25.982
SOME VOIGTS I'M SOME RE USE OF

02:50:26.049 --> 02:50:28.117
SITES DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS

02:50:28.184 --> 02:50:30.853
OF SITES AND SO ON AND CERTAINLY

02:50:30.920 --> 02:50:32.589
ALSO THE SELL OR LEASE OF SOME

02:50:32.655 --> 02:50:34.324
SITES.

02:50:34.390 --> 02:50:35.425
IN OAKLAND'S CASE --

02:50:35.491 --> 02:50:37.093
AS WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THE

02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:39.329
PANEL BEFORE ME ON THE DISTRICT

02:50:39.395 --> 02:50:41.030
HAS COME UP WITH A DRAFT PLAN

02:50:41.097 --> 02:50:44.100
THEY CALL THE CITY PLAN --

02:50:44.167 --> 02:50:45.501
TO LOOK AT TWENTY FOUR SCHOOL

02:50:45.568 --> 02:50:46.636
SITES HAVE TAKEN ACTION I

02:50:46.703 --> 02:50:49.872
BELIEVE TO DATE ON ONE OF THOSE --

02:50:49.939 --> 02:50:50.873
THEY'VE NOT ADOPTED THE WHOLE

02:50:50.940 --> 02:50:52.942
PLAN UNLESS IT'S BEEN DONE IN

02:50:53.009 --> 02:50:54.410
THE LAST WEEK AND I'M JUST NOT

02:50:54.477 --> 02:50:55.612
CAUGHT UP TO IT --

IS BEING FOCUSED ON THE

02:53:45.148 --> 02:53:46.816
DISTRICTS THAT ARE --

02:53:46.883 --> 02:53:48.985
REALLY STRUGGLING THE VAST VAST

02:53:49.051 --> 02:53:50.520
MAJORITY OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE

02:53:50.586 --> 02:53:52.388
MAKING THE HARD DECISIONS BEING

02:53:52.455 --> 02:53:55.057
RESPONSIBLE TO LIVE WITHIN THEIR

02:53:55.124 --> 02:53:57.126
MEANS -- AND

02:53:57.193 --> 02:53:59.428
AND AND TO ME YOU KNOW.

02:53:59.495 --> 02:54:01.497
I MEAN I I I I I WISH THAT THE

02:54:01.564 --> 02:54:03.399
THE BUDGET SHARE WAS STILL HERE

02:54:03.466 --> 02:54:05.234
BECAUSE I WANTED TO PUSH BACK ON

02:54:05.301 --> 02:54:06.102
ON NOW --

02:54:06.169 --> 02:54:07.136
ONE OF HIS COMMENTS AND PERHAPS

02:54:07.203 --> 02:54:09.338
HE'S HIM AMOROUS STAFF IS

02:54:09.405 --> 02:54:10.106
LISTENING.

02:54:10.173 --> 02:54:16.946
TO THE ON ON THE TV BUT IT ON ME

02:54:17.013 --> 02:54:19.448
HE MADE THE COMMENT THAT THAT IT --

02:54:19.515 --> 02:54:21.651
IT'S A IT'S A POLITICAL PLOY TO

02:54:21.717 --> 02:54:22.518
BE -- YOU

02:54:22.585 --> 02:54:24.253
KNOW THE TURN TO THE STATE FOR

02:54:24.320 --> 02:54:25.288
MORE FUNDING.

02:54:25.354 --> 02:54:28.925
BUT TO ME IT SEEMS OBVIOUS THAT

02:54:28.991 --> 02:54:31.794
HAVE IT IS NOT TRUE THAT THE

02:54:31.861 --> 02:54:34.096
THAT THE DISTRICT RATES OF THE

02:54:34.163 --> 02:54:35.531
PENSION COSTS.

02:54:35.598 --> 02:54:38.000
ARE MORE THAN DOUBLE OF WHAT IT

02:54:38.067 --> 02:54:43.806
WAS IN --

02:54:43.873 --> 02:54:44.440
TWENTY THIRTEEN TWENTY FORTY YES

02:54:44.507 --> 02:54:46.442
YES ROUGHLY EIGHT POINT TWO FIVE

02:54:46.509 --> 02:54:48.010
IS THE HISTORICAL STIRS RATE IN

02:54:48.077 --> 02:54:49.579
WHERE ABOVE SIXTEEN RIGHT NOW SO

02:54:49.645 --> 02:54:50.847
THAT WOULD BE MORE THAN DOUBLE

02:54:50.913 --> 02:54:52.648
AND WE'RE GOING TO EIGHTEEN AND

02:54:52.715 --> 02:54:54.383
19% BY. TWENTY TWENTY ONE OF

02:54:54.450 --> 02:54:55.985
WITH SOME ASSISTANCE PROPOSED IN

02:54:56.052 --> 02:54:58.154
THE BUDGET AND THEN STIRS.

02:54:58.221 --> 02:54:59.889
STIRS HAS A FORECAST THAT

02:54:59.956 --> 02:55:01.324
ACTUALLY BRINGS US BACK --

02:55:01.390 --> 02:55:03.025
AFTER HITTING IN THE NINETEEN

02:55:03.092 --> 02:55:04.360
BRINGS US BACK INTO THE EIGHT

02:55:04.427 --> 02:55:07.763
LOW EIGHTEENS --

02:55:07.830 --> 02:55:10.566
I FORGOT THE YEAR TWENTY FIRST

02:55:10.633 --> 02:55:11.701
YEAR THINGS TWENTY ONE TWENTY

02:55:11.767 --> 02:55:12.735
TWO OF THEM FIVE ELCO.

02:55:12.802 --> 02:55:14.070
BUT BUT ROUGHLY DOUBLING --

02:55:14.136 --> 02:55:16.272
WITHIN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD

02:55:16.339 --> 02:55:17.640
TIME AND THEN YOU YOU MADE THE

02:55:17.707 --> 02:55:18.574
COMMENT THAT.

02:55:18.641 --> 02:55:21.410
THAT IS ONLY PROJECTED THAT THE

02:55:21.477 --> 02:55:23.212
THE THE HIGH NEED SPECIAL

02:55:23.279 --> 02:55:24.914
EDUCATION COSTS ESPECIALLY ARE

02:55:24.981 --> 02:55:26.249
ARE PROJECTED TO BE.

02:55:26.315 --> 02:55:28.618
CONTINUE --

02:55:28.684 --> 02:55:30.620
TO TO TO INCREASE.

02:55:30.686 --> 02:55:34.023
AND WAIT WE ALSO HAVE THE

02:55:34.090 --> 02:55:34.924
SITUATION.

02:55:34.991 --> 02:55:38.728
OF A IT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:55:38.794 --> 02:55:40.763
FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF LCF WE'RE

02:55:40.830 --> 02:55:42.431
ONLY TALKING ABOUT GETTING BACK

02:55:42.498 --> 02:55:44.100
TO WHERE WE WERE.

02:55:44.166 --> 02:55:45.067
IN -- SEVEN

02:55:45.134 --> 02:55:46.068
OH AID SO.

02:55:46.135 --> 02:55:49.538
IT'S A CORRECT.

02:55:49.605 --> 02:55:50.973
ROUGHLY SPEAKING DEPEND ON

02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:52.942
PERSPECTIVE YES.

02:55:53.009 --> 02:55:54.610
THE THE THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL WAS

02:55:54.677 --> 02:55:56.078
TO GET BACK TO PRE RECESSION

02:55:56.145 --> 02:55:58.948
LEVELS AN N. --

02:55:59.015 --> 02:56:01.284
EDUCATION FUNDING IN IRAQ DURING

02:56:01.350 --> 02:56:03.552
GROWTH IN FACT WAS WORTH YES.

02:56:03.619 --> 02:56:05.688
SO.

02:56:05.755 --> 02:56:07.390
I MEAN HOW MUCH OF ALL OF WHAT

02:56:07.456 --> 02:56:09.425
WE'RE SEEING AND HAPPENING HERE

02:56:09.492 --> 02:56:11.961
NOT JUST TO THOSE WITH NEGATIVE

02:56:12.028 --> 02:56:13.562
AND QUALIFY CERTIFICATIONS.

02:56:13.629 --> 02:56:14.664
BUT WITH ALL THE DISTRICTS

02:56:14.730 --> 02:56:17.533
STRUGGLING IS THE FACT THAT WERE

02:56:17.600 --> 02:56:19.335
THEY ALL DISTRICTS ARE BEING

02:56:19.402 --> 02:56:22.238
ASKED YOU KNOW TO TO COVER SO

02:56:22.305 --> 02:56:24.073
MUCH MORE IN TERMS OF THESE.

02:56:24.140 --> 02:56:28.711
THESE RISING FIX COSTS WITH.

02:56:28.778 --> 02:56:31.280
YOU KNOW WELL OF FUNDING THAT --

02:56:31.347 --> 02:56:33.316
WHICH IS LIT WITH WAS BASICALLY

02:56:33.382 --> 02:56:34.784
GETTING THE GOAL WAS TO GET US

02:56:34.850 --> 02:56:37.086
BACK TO WHERE WE WERE --

02:56:37.153 --> 02:56:40.756
BEFORE THE RECESSION.

02:56:40.823 --> 02:56:42.758
WELL THIS IS NOT IT.

02:56:42.825 --> 02:56:45.094
THIS IS NOT AN EASY EQUATION --

02:56:45.161 --> 02:56:46.629
UNDERSTAND THAT FOR SOME

02:56:46.696 --> 02:56:48.731
DISTRICTS AND ROMAN IS PLAYING A

02:56:48.798 --> 02:56:50.866
ROLE FOR A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY

02:56:50.933 --> 02:56:51.867
OF DISTRICTS --

02:56:51.934 --> 02:56:56.038
THEIR ABILITY TO I'M A FASHION

02:56:56.105 --> 02:56:58.207
TO REDUCTIONS IN ENROLLMENT --

02:56:58.274 --> 02:56:59.508
DECLINING ENROLLMENT YEAH

02:56:59.575 --> 02:57:01.877
WHETHER SHORT TERM OR LONG TERM

02:57:01.944 --> 02:57:03.412
CERTAINLY HAS --

02:57:03.479 --> 02:57:05.681
A VERY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

02:57:05.748 --> 02:57:06.949
THEM THEY'VE GOT TO BE

02:57:07.016 --> 02:57:08.985
RESPONSIVE STATE LAW PROVIDES

02:57:09.051 --> 02:57:10.886
FOR THAT YEAR OF DELAY THAT --

02:57:10.953 --> 02:57:12.588
WE OFTEN REFER TO IT AS THE SOFT

02:57:12.655 --> 02:57:13.556
LANDING --

02:57:13.622 --> 02:57:14.857
WHERE YOU GET THE CHOICE OF

02:57:14.924 --> 02:57:16.392
USING THE GREATER OF THE CURRENT

02:57:16.459 --> 02:57:17.760
YEAR THE PRIOR YEARS --

02:57:17.827 --> 02:57:19.595
AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE WHICH

02:57:19.662 --> 02:57:23.299
IS THE THE CASE LOAD FACTOR IN

02:57:23.366 --> 02:57:23.599
THE REVENUE.

02:57:23.666 --> 02:57:26.535
RIGHT --

02:57:26.602 --> 02:57:29.605
MANY DISTRICTS ARE ALSO TURNING

02:57:29.672 --> 02:57:31.140
TO THEIR LOCAL --

02:57:31.207 --> 02:57:34.343
CONSTITUENTS THEIR TAXPAYERS FOR

02:57:34.410 --> 02:57:35.444
ASSISTANCE WHETHER THAT'S YOUR

02:57:35.511 --> 02:57:37.713
PARCEL TAX OR MORE COMMENT ON

02:57:37.780 --> 02:57:38.881
THE FACILITY SIDE THROUGH

02:57:38.948 --> 02:57:40.616
GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND BUT MANY

02:57:40.683 --> 02:57:41.917
MANY -- MORE

02:57:41.984 --> 02:57:43.519
MORE PREDOMINANTLY IN THE

02:57:43.586 --> 02:57:45.187
NORTHERN HALF OF THE STATE THAN

02:57:45.254 --> 02:57:46.989
THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE STATE --

02:57:47.056 --> 02:57:48.691
LOOK TO PARCEL TAXES TO FUND

02:57:48.758 --> 02:57:51.093
VERY SPECIFIC THINGS LIKE LOWER

02:57:51.160 --> 02:57:54.897
CLASS SIZES AND BROADER

02:57:54.964 --> 02:57:57.166
CURRICULUM OFFERINGS INCLUDING

02:57:57.233 --> 02:57:59.235
MUSIC ART --

02:57:59.301 --> 02:58:01.303
SUPPORTING OTHER --

02:58:01.370 --> 02:58:02.471
HIGH PRIORITIES IN THEIR

02:58:02.538 --> 02:58:03.506
DISTRICT SO.

02:58:03.572 --> 02:58:09.412
IT IT IS NOT A IT'S COMPLICATED

02:58:09.478 --> 02:58:10.846
IT'S A COMPLICATED AND HAND I

AND SO --

02:59:43.806 --> 02:59:44.974
THAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE THAT WE

POINTS BACK THEN.

03:00:00.289 --> 03:00:02.358
RIGHT -- AND

03:00:02.424 --> 03:00:04.226
IT WOULD JUST BE A SLIGHTLY

03:00:04.293 --> 03:00:06.061
DIFFERENT LIST --

03:00:06.128 --> 03:00:07.630

WE'RE CONCERNED THAT AS WELL

03:05:13.168 --> 03:05:14.837
MEANING AS THAT MIGHT BE AND WE

03:05:14.903 --> 03:05:16.171
DO BELIEVE IT TO BE COMPLETELY

03:05:16.238 --> 03:05:17.272
WHILE MEANING.

03:05:17.339 --> 03:05:18.474

PROGRAM WITH AN L. C. F. F. IS

03:05:23.145 --> 03:05:24.746

03:05:33.522 --> 03:05:34.456
THE CLIFF AND LOOK INTO THE A

03:05:34.523 --> 03:05:36.892

AS YOU KNOW THAT --

03:06:14.930 --> 03:06:16.031
BY DESIGN CHARTER SCHOOLS

03:06:16.098 --> 03:06:17.566
ACTUALLY BEGIN WITH MORE

03:06:17.633 --> 03:06:19.301
TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

03:06:19.368 --> 03:06:20.969
THAN TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS.

03:06:21.036 --> 03:06:22.204
WITH THE PUBLIC HEARINGS ON

THEIR ACTUAL CHARTERS WHICH ARE

03:06:24.306 --> 03:06:25.641
SIXTEEN POINT DOCUMENTS AND THE

03:06:25.707 --> 03:06:26.675
FRAMEWORK FOR CHARTERS IS

03:06:26.742 --> 03:06:29.411
