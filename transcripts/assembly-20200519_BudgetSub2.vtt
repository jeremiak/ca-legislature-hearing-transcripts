CUTS BUT IF WE HAVE TO GO DOWN

00:34:37.241 --> 00:34:38.743
THAT ROAD. I THINK WE SHOULD

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:40.978
REALLY CONSIDER USING A SCALPEL

00:34:41.045 --> 00:34:43.114

THREE IN DELIBERATIONS OF THE

00:38:20.398 --> 00:38:21.766

LOOK A LITTLE BIT DEEPER TO THE

00:38:47.825 --> 00:38:50.161
SIDE ARE THERE AREAS WHERE SHE

00:38:50.227 --> 00:38:52.196
WHICH SHOULD BE CUT MORE AS

SUCH AS ADMINISTRATION AND

00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:54.598

00:42:59.076 --> 00:43:00.911
IN THE BUDGET YEAR AS THEIR

00:43:00.978 --> 00:43:03.047
STERN SERVING NOW. THE LAST

00:43:03.113 --> 00:43:04.315
MAJOR COMPONENT OF THE ME

00:43:04.381 --> 00:43:05.282
REVISION HIGHER EDUCATION

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:07.084
PACKAGES THE TRIGGER THAT

00:43:07.151 --> 00:43:08.852
YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT IF THE STATE

00:43:08.919 --> 00:43:10.654
WHERE TO GET FOURTEEN BILLION

00:43:10.721 --> 00:43:13.457
IN ADDITIONAL- FEDERAL RELIEF

00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:15.793
FUNDING. THAT WOULD GO TO

00:43:15.859 --> 00:43:18.028
HOWEVER SEND ALL OF THESE I'M

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:19.263
ALMOST ALL OF THE PROPOSED

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.565
REDUCTIONS IT WOULD BE ALL OR

00:43:21.632 --> 00:43:23.267
NOTHING ALL OF THE RESTORATIONS

00:43:23.334 --> 00:43:24.568
WOULD BE APPLIED FOR NONE OF

00:43:24.635 --> 00:43:26.804
THEM. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:28.772
FIGURE MOST OF THE REDUCTIONS

00:43:28.839 --> 00:43:30.574
WOULD BE RESTORED AND VIRTUALLY

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:32.242
ALL OF THOSE REDUCTIONS ARE ON

00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:34.044
GOING SO EVEN THOUGH THE

00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:35.412
FEDERAL RELIEF MONEY IF THAT

00:43:35.479 --> 00:43:37.314
MATERIALIZES WILL BE VERY

00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:39.283
LIKELY ONE TIME. IT WOULD BE

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:40.484
USING TO SUSTAIN ONGOING

00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:43.887
PROGRAM. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE

00:43:43.954 --> 00:43:45.556
THREE OF THE HAND OUT IT'LL

00:43:45.622 --> 00:43:46.323
SHOW YOU ALL OF THE COMMUNITY

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:49.126
COLLEGES ARE PROPOSALS YOU CAN

00:43:49.193 --> 00:43:50.527
SEE THE A PORTION MEGA KAT OF A

00:43:50.594 --> 00:43:53.497
HUNDRED- I'M SORRY. OF FIVE

00:43:53.564 --> 00:43:54.264
HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE

00:43:54.331 --> 00:43:56.266
MILLION BUT YOU CAN ALSO SEE

00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:57.701
SIGNIFICANT CUTS TO ADULT

00:43:57.768 --> 00:44:01.805
EDUCATION TIME PERCENT 58% CUT

00:44:01.872 --> 00:44:02.306
TO THE STRONG WORK FORCE

00:44:02.373 --> 00:44:05.109
PROGRAM. IF YOU TURN TO PAGE

00:44:05.175 --> 00:44:07.044
FOUR IT SHOWS- THE REACTIONS

00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:09.279
THAT WE HAVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S

00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:11.749
NAY REVISION FOR THE COLLEGE AS-

00:44:11.815 --> 00:44:13.317
WE KNOW THE STATE'S FACING VERY

00:44:13.384 --> 00:44:15.919
HARD BUDGET SITUATION WE THINK

00:44:15.986 --> 00:44:16.587
THEY'RE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:44:16.653 --> 00:44:18.055
APPROACH OF USING MANY

00:44:18.122 --> 00:44:19.990
DIFFERENT BUDGET TOOLS IS

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:22.893
APPROPRIATE. BUT WE THINK THAT

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.261
AS A CHURCH WAS MENTIONED IN

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:24.862
THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING

00:44:24.928 --> 00:44:26.163
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:28.198
MORE STRATEGIC MORE TARGETED

00:44:28.265 --> 00:44:30.567
MORE SELECTIVE IN HOW YOU GO

00:44:30.634 --> 00:44:33.470
ABOUT ACHIEVING YOUR ADOPTION.

00:44:33.537 --> 00:44:34.872
WE ALSO THINK THERE ARE SOME

00:44:34.938 --> 00:44:36.173
OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE BUDGET

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.142
LANDSCAPE TO IDENTIFY SOME

00:44:38.208 --> 00:44:39.643
LOTTERY FUNDS THAT YOU COULD

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:41.812
REPURPOSE SOME UNSPENT. ONE

00:44:41.879 --> 00:44:45.449
TIME- NINETEEN TWENTY FUNDS

00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:46.016
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FUNDS THAT

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:48.685
COULD BE YOUR BEST. I'M WHAT'S

00:44:48.752 --> 00:44:50.187
THAT WE THINK WE'VE TRIED TO

00:44:50.254 --> 00:44:51.455
IDENTIFY SOME LOWER PRIORITY

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:52.656
PROGRAMS THAT YOU COULD SWAP

00:44:52.723 --> 00:44:54.358
OUT WITH CUTS TO APPORTIONMENT

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:56.193
FOR EXAMPLE. WERE ALSO SOMEWHAT

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:57.494
CONCERNED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S

00:44:57.561 --> 00:44:58.962
TRIGGER APPROACH AND NOT FOR

00:44:59.029 --> 00:45:00.798
THE COLLEGES FOR EXAMPLE IF THE

00:45:00.864 --> 00:45:03.133
MONEY DOES MATERIALIZE IT WOULD

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.135
NOT ONLY RESTORE THE BASE

00:45:05.202 --> 00:45:06.937
REDUCTION OF 8% TO A PORTION

00:45:07.004 --> 00:45:09.206
MEN'S BUT ALSO THE COLA. SO THE

00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:10.140
STARTING POINT YOU WOULD BE

00:45:10.207 --> 00:45:11.842
WORKING FROM NEXT YEAR WOULD BE

00:45:11.909 --> 00:45:13.877
EVEN HIGHER THE MAGNITUDE OF

00:45:13.944 --> 00:45:16.580
THE PROGRAMMATIC CUTS IN TWENTY

00:45:16.647 --> 00:45:18.682
ONE TWENTY TWO MIGHT SEEM EVEN

00:45:18.749 --> 00:45:19.550
MORE SIGNIFICANT FOR THEIR

00:45:19.616 --> 00:45:21.618
FEELINGS TO YOU RIGHT NOW. WE

00:45:21.685 --> 00:45:23.587
HAVE TO TURN IT IS THAT YOU

00:45:23.654 --> 00:45:27.091
COULD CONSIDER ON PAGE FIVE WE

00:45:27.157 --> 00:45:28.559
SHOW THE ALTERNATIVE THAT WE'VE

00:45:28.625 --> 00:45:30.360
LAID OUT FOR PORTION THAT. IT

00:45:30.427 --> 00:45:31.929
WAS ALSO WAS TO ACHIEVE THE

00:45:31.995 --> 00:45:33.497
SAME LEVEL GENERAL FUND SAVINGS

00:45:33.564 --> 00:45:35.299
AS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS

00:45:35.365 --> 00:45:37.201
A MEMEBER VISION BUT TO ACHIEVE

00:45:37.267 --> 00:45:38.702
IT DIFFERENTLY SO THE COMMENTS

00:45:38.769 --> 00:45:39.670
ARE THERE JUST FOR YOUR

00:45:39.736 --> 00:45:40.871
REFERENCE DOWN THE ROAD BUT IF

00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:42.072
YOU FOCUS ON THE DOLLAR

00:45:42.139 --> 00:45:45.409
CHANGES. I'M THE PACKAGE WOULD

00:45:45.476 --> 00:45:47.644
ELIMINATE ONE NON NEED BASED

00:45:47.711 --> 00:45:50.114
PROGRAM. IT WOULD ELIMINATE A

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.449
BRIGHT. I'M A COLLEGE THAT WAS

00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:54.351
RECENTLY CREATED NOT BY THE

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:56.753
STATE IT WOULD REDIRECT SOME

00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:59.089
MONEY THAT CURRENTLY SPORTS

00:45:59.156 --> 00:46:02.192
TEAMS TO. EARN FOR THEIR PER.

00:46:02.259 --> 00:46:04.328
IN BUT THAT COMES AS AND- IT

00:46:04.394 --> 00:46:06.630
WOULD STOP THAT PRACTICE. IT

00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:07.865
WAS THE- DESTRUCTION THAT THE

00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:09.533
STATE CURRENTLY PLAYS LOTTERY

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:12.703
FUNDS TO ALLOW COLLEGES TO USE

00:46:12.769 --> 00:46:13.170
THOSE FUNDS FOR ONLINE

00:46:13.237 --> 00:46:14.571
TECHNOLOGY AND RESOURCES

00:46:14.638 --> 00:46:16.306
SOMETHING THAT'S OBVIOUSLY HIGH

00:46:16.373 --> 00:46:18.742
DEMAND RIGHT NOW. SO TAKING ALL

00:46:18.809 --> 00:46:20.677
OF THOSE TARGETED CUTS ACHIEVES

00:46:20.744 --> 00:46:23.447
ABOUT HALF THE LEVEL OF SAVINGS

00:46:23.514 --> 00:46:23.981
AS AND THE GOVERNOR'S NAY

00:46:24.047 --> 00:46:25.782
REVISION. THEN WE THINK THERE'S

00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:27.751
OPPORTUNITIES TO RE DIRECT

00:46:27.818 --> 00:46:29.219
ALREADY EXISTING FEDERAL

00:46:29.286 --> 00:46:31.655
RESOURCES SO AT THE GOVERNOR

00:46:31.722 --> 00:46:33.390
RIGHT NOW IS USING THE CROWN A

00:46:33.457 --> 00:46:34.992
RELIEF FUND AND THE GOVERNOR'S

00:46:35.058 --> 00:46:37.094
EMERGENCY EDUCATION REALLY FIND

00:46:37.161 --> 00:46:39.129
ENTIRELY FOR SCHOOLS. AND WE

00:46:39.196 --> 00:46:41.331
THINK YOU COULD CONSIDER USING

00:46:41.398 --> 00:46:41.865
A PORTION OF THAT FOR THE

00:46:41.932 --> 00:46:44.168
COLLEGES. SO UNDER THIS KIND OF

00:46:44.234 --> 00:46:46.637
MORE STRATEGIC APPROACH EVEN IF

00:46:46.703 --> 00:46:48.305
THE STATE WERE TO DO SOMETHING

00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:49.106
LIKE THIS IT WOULD HAVE

00:46:49.173 --> 00:46:50.674
RESERVES OR OTHER FEDERAL

00:46:50.741 --> 00:46:52.509
RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO

00:46:52.576 --> 00:46:54.211
USE NEXT YEAR IN TWENTY ONE

00:46:54.278 --> 00:46:55.312
TWENTY TWO. TO DAMPEN THE

00:46:55.379 --> 00:46:56.680
REDUCTION NOT PROGRAMS WILL

00:46:56.747 --> 00:46:59.983
FEEL AS THE ECONOMY- AS AS YOU

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:01.185
KNOW THE STATE HAS A STRUCTURAL

00:47:01.251 --> 00:47:02.753
IMBALANCE THAT RIGHT NOW IS

00:47:02.819 --> 00:47:04.821
ANTICIPATED TO LAST POTENTIALLY

00:47:04.888 --> 00:47:07.958
AS LONG AS TWENTY THREE TWENTY

00:47:08.025 --> 00:47:10.093
FOUR. PAGE SIX LAYS OUT AN

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.528
ALTERNATIVE FOR YOU TO CONSIDER

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:14.464
ON CT. R. THE AIM OF THIS

00:47:14.531 --> 00:47:17.501
ALTERNATIVE IS TO ALSO REDIRECT

00:47:17.568 --> 00:47:18.635
FUNDS FROM LOWER PRIORITY

00:47:18.702 --> 00:47:21.004
PROGRAMS AND UNPROVEN PROGRAMS

00:47:21.071 --> 00:47:22.005
TO TRY TO SUPPORT THE STRONG

00:47:22.072 --> 00:47:23.974
WORK FORCE PROGRAM. WHICH IS

00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:25.842
THE PROGRAM NOT THE COLLEGES

00:47:25.909 --> 00:47:27.711
RECEIVE TO PAY FOR HIGHER C. T.

00:47:27.778 --> 00:47:28.912
EQUIPMENT COSTS AN

00:47:28.979 --> 00:47:31.081
INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS. SO WITH A

00:47:31.148 --> 00:47:32.849
LOT OF FOLKS RIGHT NOW LAID OFF

00:47:32.916 --> 00:47:34.251
ATTENTION HE WANTED TO GO BACK

00:47:34.318 --> 00:47:36.186
TO THE COLLEGES TO BE RETRAINED

00:47:36.253 --> 00:47:37.487
THREE SKILLED THIS IS A PROGRAM

00:47:37.554 --> 00:47:39.223
THAT COULD HELP THEM DO THAT.

00:47:39.289 --> 00:47:40.591
SO W TRY TO REDIRECT MONEY

00:47:40.657 --> 00:47:41.992
FROM THESE LOWER PRIORITY AREAS

00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:43.293
SO THAT THE STATE COULD IN

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:46.597
STATE SUSTAIN ENROLLMENT. IN

00:47:46.663 --> 00:47:48.298
THOSE EACH YEAR COURSES. IF YOU

00:47:48.365 --> 00:47:50.300
TURN TO PAGE SEVEN IT SHOWS YOU

00:47:50.367 --> 00:47:53.103
ALL OF THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR CSU.

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:55.305
YOU CAN SEE THE A THREE HUNDRED

00:47:55.372 --> 00:47:56.773
AND NINETY EIGHT MILLION BASS

00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:00.177
REDUCTION FOR EXAMPLE FOR CSU.

00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:01.411
ROACHES SIMILAR WITH WITH

00:48:01.478 --> 00:48:03.146
TRYING PROPOSALS AND TAKING A

00:48:03.213 --> 00:48:05.349
BASS REDUCTION. IF YOU GO TO

00:48:05.415 --> 00:48:07.884
PAGE EIGHT YOU CAN SEE THE SAME

00:48:07.951 --> 00:48:09.486
APPROACH BEING TAKEN FOR YOU

00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:11.722
SEEING WITH THE WITHDRAWAL OF

00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:13.557
JANUARY PROPOSALS ON THE 10%

00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:16.159
REDUCTION WHICH IN THIS CASE-

00:48:16.226 --> 00:48:16.727
IS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY

00:48:16.793 --> 00:48:20.931
EIGHT MILLION. I DON'T THE MAIN

00:48:20.998 --> 00:48:23.267
PAGE OF THE HANDOUT SO PAGE

00:48:23.333 --> 00:48:25.168
NINE I'M SHOWS YOUR REACTION TO

00:48:25.235 --> 00:48:25.902
THE MAY REVISION FOR THE

00:48:25.969 --> 00:48:28.071
UNIVERSITIES I'M HERE WE THINK

00:48:28.138 --> 00:48:28.839
TO THERE'S SOME MISSED

00:48:28.905 --> 00:48:30.173
OPPORTUNITIES TO BE MORE

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.242
TARGETED AND HOW YOU GO ABOUT.

00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:34.745
BUILDING THEIR BY JETS. I'M ALL

00:48:34.811 --> 00:48:36.113
OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION

00:48:36.179 --> 00:48:38.048
SEGMENTS ARE GONNA HAVE A HARD

00:48:38.115 --> 00:48:38.649
TIME RIGHT NOW ADJUSTING THEIR

00:48:38.715 --> 00:48:41.485
BUDGET SO QUICKLY SUMMER TERM

00:48:41.551 --> 00:48:42.386
IS STARTING A COUPLE WEEKS FROM

00:48:42.452 --> 00:48:44.354
NOW AND THE ACADEMIC TERM IS

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:45.856
STARTING FOR SOME COMP

00:48:45.922 --> 00:48:48.558
CAMPUSES. AS EARLY AS OF LATE

00:48:48.625 --> 00:48:50.761
GUEST SO CAMPUS IS ALREADY

00:48:50.827 --> 00:48:52.663
HAVING TO DEVELOP COURSE

00:48:52.729 --> 00:48:56.366
SCHEDULES TO STAFF. SUCH IT'S

00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:57.968
HARD FOR THEM TO BE SUPER

00:48:58.035 --> 00:49:00.304
NIMBLE SUPER QUICKLY SO WHAT

00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:00.837
KIND DO IT JUST GIVE THEM

00:49:00.904 --> 00:49:03.173
LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO GIVE

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.642
THEM TWENTY TWENTY ONES THAT

00:49:05.709 --> 00:49:07.844
THEY CAN PLAN FOR DOCUMENTS

00:49:07.911 --> 00:49:15.052
THAT. YOU NEED IT DONE OUT. IT

00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:17.254
PAGE UP AND OUT. OUT IN A LOT

00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:19.156
OF APPROACH FOR THE UNIVERSE.

00:49:19.222 --> 00:49:19.756
AND THE FIRST THING IN IN THE

00:49:19.823 --> 00:49:21.458
UP IS TO A REPURPOSE THE MUCH

00:49:21.525 --> 00:49:23.460
THE ON SPENT TWENTY NAY TWENTY

00:49:23.527 --> 00:49:25.128
AS POSSIBLE SO NORM WHEN THE

00:49:25.195 --> 00:49:26.763
STATE ENTERS A RECESSION THE

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:28.131
FIRST THING IT DOES ITS FIRST

00:49:28.198 --> 00:49:30.500
OURSE OF ACTION IS TO TRY TO

00:49:30.567 --> 00:49:32.436
FIND EVERY ON SPENT DOLLAR THAT

00:49:32.502 --> 00:49:33.970
IT CAN. IT SPECIALLY VERY

00:49:34.037 --> 00:49:35.305
RESEND THING WHERE THE

00:49:35.372 --> 00:49:36.940
PROGRAM'S HAVEN'T GOTTEN UP AND

00:49:37.007 --> 00:49:38.508
RUNNING VERY FEW PEOPLE WILL BE

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:39.710
AFFECTED IF THOSE DOLLARS ARE

00:49:39.776 --> 00:49:41.945
REPURPOSE TO SUPPORT THE BASED

00:49:42.012 --> 00:49:43.914
ON GOING PROGRAM. I SEE MY

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:45.615
RECALL LAST YEAR THE STATE

00:49:45.682 --> 00:49:47.351
PROVIDED BOTH THAT UNIVERSITIES

00:49:47.417 --> 00:49:48.318
WITH QUITE A BIT OF ONE TIME

00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:50.387

00:49:55.826 --> 00:49:57.060
MOST OF THAT MONEY AS DEFERRED

00:49:57.127 --> 00:49:59.062
MAINTENANCE MONEY. AND YOU

00:49:59.129 --> 00:49:59.863
MIGHT HAVE HEARD US SAY

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.131
THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE RECOVERY

00:50:01.198 --> 00:50:02.432
HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS TO DEAL

00:50:02.499 --> 00:50:03.734
WITH UNIVERSITIES MAINTENANCE

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:06.136
ISSUES. BUT IN A RECESSION

00:50:06.203 --> 00:50:07.704
PARTICULAR RECESSION THAT CAME

00:50:07.771 --> 00:50:10.540
SO QUICKLY AND MIGHT BE SO DEEP

00:50:10.607 --> 00:50:11.174
IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU

00:50:11.241 --> 00:50:12.743
WANT TO CONSIDER RE PURPOSING

00:50:12.809 --> 00:50:14.378
FOR ONGOING PROGRAMS. THIS

00:50:14.444 --> 00:50:15.579
WOULD STILL MEAN YOU COULD

00:50:15.645 --> 00:50:17.214
DEVELOP A LONG TERM PLAN WITH

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.915
THE UNIVERSITIES TO TRY TO DEAL

00:50:18.982 --> 00:50:19.483
WITH OUTSTANDING MAINTENANCE

00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:22.018
ISSUES. OVER THE LONG RUN.

00:50:22.085 --> 00:50:23.420
THERE'S ALSO SOME OPPORTUNITIES

00:50:23.487 --> 00:50:26.490
WE THINK THE GOVERNOR WILL BE

00:50:26.556 --> 00:50:27.591
USED ONE JANUARY AUGMENT. ONE

00:50:27.657 --> 00:50:29.326
TIME PROPOSAL WE IT'S JUST NOT

00:50:29.393 --> 00:50:30.827
A PRUDENT TIME TO DO NEW ONE

00:50:30.894 --> 00:50:33.630
TIME THINGS. HE ANOTHER THING

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:35.298
YOU MIGHT CONSIDER IS TARGETED

00:50:35.365 --> 00:50:37.167
REDUCTIONS SO FIGURE OUT WHERE

00:50:37.234 --> 00:50:38.835
WHERE WITHIN THE UNIVERSITIES

00:50:38.902 --> 00:50:41.471
MIGHT BE ANOTHER- A PLACE THAT

00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:42.572
WOULD HAVE LESS IMPACT ON

00:50:42.639 --> 00:50:44.608
DIRECT STUDENT SERVICES

00:50:44.674 --> 00:50:45.742
INSTRUCTION AND SUPPORT

00:50:45.809 --> 00:50:47.878
SERVICES IN THE BUDGET YEAR. SO

00:50:47.944 --> 00:50:49.780
WE JUST ILLUSTRATE SIMPLY SHOW

00:50:49.846 --> 00:50:52.115
YOU WHAT A 10% CUT TO USE THESE

00:50:52.182 --> 00:50:53.617
THREE STARTS BUDGET WOULD LOOK

00:50:53.683 --> 00:50:54.684
LIKE JUST THE STATE GENERAL

00:50:54.751 --> 00:50:57.621
FUND. OF FLEXIBLE PORTION OF

00:50:57.687 --> 00:50:59.756
THEIR RESEARCH- IF THE STATE

00:50:59.823 --> 00:51:01.591
WERE TO TAKE A 10% CUT TO THAT

00:51:01.658 --> 00:51:04.127
HOT WHICH EQUATES TO ABOUT

00:51:04.194 --> 00:51:05.128
THIRTY SEVEN MILLION. IT WOULD

00:51:05.195 --> 00:51:06.263
STILL HAVE FOUR POINT EIGHT

00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:08.965
BILLION IN FEDERAL PRIVATE

00:51:09.032 --> 00:51:10.233

00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:15.639
KNOW IS CORE TO THEIR MISSION.

00:51:15.705 --> 00:51:17.140
SO THE LAST THING THEN WOULD BE

00:51:17.207 --> 00:51:18.442
WORKING WITH THE SEGMENTS TO

00:51:18.508 --> 00:51:19.376
FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD BE A

00:51:19.443 --> 00:51:21.445
REASONABLE EXPECTATION TO JOT

00:51:21.511 --> 00:51:22.579

PROGRAM. SO WE PENCILLED IN

00:51:28.251 --> 00:51:30.287
HERE JUST A STARTING POINT FOR

00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:32.589

PURPOSEFUL AGREEMENTS WITH THE

00:51:37.227 --> 00:51:38.829

SUPPORTING THOSE PROGRAMS. IN

00:51:42.466 --> 00:51:44.701
THE BUDGET YEAR. SO THE LAST

00:51:44.768 --> 00:51:46.470
POINT IS ARE WE ENCOURAGE YOU

00:51:46.536 --> 00:51:47.337

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:08.844
FOR PERSPECTIVE THAT IS THE

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:10.779
QUILT AT THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO

01:14:10.846 --> 01:14:12.581

THE C. ISSUE BUDGET IS MORE

01:14:31.066 --> 01:14:32.701
SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:33.936
CLOSE TO ONE HUNDRED BILLION

01:14:34.002 --> 01:14:35.804

THE FOR THE NEXT YEAR. OF THAT

01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:42.744
HUNDRED WE BELIEVE ABOUT FIFTY

01:14:42.811 --> 01:14:44.046
BILLION DOLLARS OF THIS IS FOR

01:14:44.112 --> 01:14:45.781
ON GOING MANDATORY COSTS FOR

01:14:45.848 --> 01:14:48.450
SUCH THINGS AS HEALTH CARE. AND

01:14:48.517 --> 01:14:50.485
PENSION RATE INCREASES.

01:14:50.552 --> 01:14:52.955
ADDITIONALLY THE OTHER 50% WE

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:55.524
COULD EASILY SPEND ON. A ONE

01:14:55.591 --> 01:14:57.226
TIME CODE RELATED COSTS TO GET

01:14:57.292 --> 01:14:58.794

TECHNOLOGY ADDITIONAL OVERTIME

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:03.999
AND STAFF COSTS. THEREFORE WE

01:15:04.066 --> 01:15:05.634
RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THE

01:15:05.701 --> 01:15:06.635
LEGISLATURE AND THE

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:08.136
ADMINISTRATION MINIMIZE THE

01:15:08.203 --> 01:15:09.304
REDUCTION TO OUR BASE

01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:12.875
OPERATIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:14.443
I WANT POSSIBLE PATH IS TO

01:15:14.509 --> 01:15:16.011
ADOPT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:17.746
ALTERNATIVE WHICH SWEEPS

UNSPENT CURRENT YOUR MONEY'S

01:15:19.781 --> 01:15:21.850
AND LESSONS THE REDUCTION BY

01:15:21.917 --> 01:15:22.417
THE SAME ABOUT IN THE BUDGET

01:15:22.484 --> 01:15:25.721
YEAR. WELL THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

01:15:25.787 --> 01:15:27.189
POTENTIAL CUT TO THE C. ISSUE

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:29.358
IS DAUNTING. WE LEARNED FROM

01:15:29.424 --> 01:15:31.193
THE GREAT RECESSION AND HAVE A

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:32.828
NUMBER OF TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO

01:15:32.895 --> 01:15:33.962
MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON OUR

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:35.831
STUDENTS. FACULTY AND ON OUR

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:39.034
STAFF. THE CSU IS PRUDENTLY

01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:41.203
GROWN RESERVES TO MEET CERTAIN

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:43.705
STRATEGIC GOALS. ONE OF WHICH

01:15:43.772 --> 01:15:45.974
IS SPENT PREPARATION FOR

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:47.843
POSSIBLE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY.

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:49.511
THIS ISSUE HAS DRAWN UPON THESE

01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:51.513
RESERVES TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.582
AND PROGRAMS IMPACTED BY COBIT

01:15:53.649 --> 01:15:55.717
NINETEEN. AND WE WILL CONTINUE

01:15:55.784 --> 01:15:58.420
TO DO SO. CLEARLY THE USE OF

01:15:58.487 --> 01:16:01.323
RESERVES WHICH ARE ONE TIME

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:03.825
FUNDS CANNOT BE A SOLUTION. BUT

01:16:03.892 --> 01:16:05.694
THEY ARE A VALUABLE ASSET THEY

01:16:05.761 --> 01:16:07.496
COULD BE UTILIZED UNTIL SUCH

01:16:07.562 --> 01:16:09.298
TIME AS OTHER RESOURCES BECOME

01:16:09.364 --> 01:16:12.901
AVAILABLE. OUR CAMPUSES ARE ALL

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:15.570
HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING FROM THE

01:16:15.637 --> 01:16:17.506
FEDERAL CARES ACT. WHICH TO

01:16:17.572 --> 01:16:18.707
MITIGATE SOME OF THE COSTS OF

01:16:18.774 --> 01:16:20.642
REVENUE LOSSES DUE TO A COVERT

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:22.611
NINETEEN. AND I LIKE TO POINT

01:16:22.678 --> 01:16:26.815
OUT THAT WE DID AN ANALYSIS OF

01:16:26.882 --> 01:16:28.817
COSTS. TO DATE THROUGH THE

01:16:28.884 --> 01:16:30.619
SPRING TERM AND WE ANTICIPATE

01:16:30.686 --> 01:16:32.654
THAT THE COMBINED. COST BECAUSE

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:34.556
A CO BID AND REVENUE LOSSES

01:16:34.623 --> 01:16:37.426
RELATED TO- SUCH THINGS AS

01:16:37.492 --> 01:16:38.894
HAVING TO CLOSE OUR STUDENT

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:41.163
HOUSING EARLY HAVING EMPTY

01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:43.465
PARKING LOTS. THE GRAND TOTAL

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:46.535
IMPACT IS APPROXIMATE THREE

01:16:46.601 --> 01:16:47.102
HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN BILLION

01:16:47.169 --> 01:16:50.973
DOLLARS. IN APRIL OF THIS ISSUE

01:16:51.039 --> 01:16:53.709
IMPLEMENTED A HIRING CHILL. AND

01:16:53.775 --> 01:16:56.078
REDUCED NONESSENTIAL TRAVEL-

01:16:56.144 --> 01:16:58.113
BOTH OF WHICH WILL SAVE MANY

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:58.680
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR THE

01:16:58.747 --> 01:17:00.549
UNIVERSITY. SO WITH ALL THESE

01:17:00.615 --> 01:17:02.317
TOOLS IN MIND WE ASK THAT THE

01:17:02.384 --> 01:17:04.119

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:21.770
TO ADDRESS A CUTE COBIT RELATED

01:17:21.837 --> 01:17:24.072
IMPACTS AND REVENUE LOSSES. WE

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:26.108

01:17:47.696 --> 01:17:49.731
COLLEGE EXPERIENCE THOSE ARE

01:17:49.798 --> 01:17:51.433
THINGS LIKE STUDENTS CENTERS

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:53.635
WHERE STUDENTS CONGREGATE STUDY

01:17:53.702 --> 01:17:55.937
HOST MEETINGS AND LISTEN TO

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:58.540
GUEST SPEAKERS. IT'S ALSO

01:17:58.607 --> 01:17:59.641
INCLUDES STUDENT HOUSING AND

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:01.176
DINING SO STUDENTS CAN LIVE ON

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:03.211
CAMPUS WHICH IS OF PARTICULAR

01:18:03.278 --> 01:18:05.113
IMPORTANCE FOR OUR CAMPUSES ARE

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:07.115
LOCATED IN AREAS. THAT HAVE

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:09.684
LIMITED STUDENT HOUSING

01:18:09.751 --> 01:18:12.387
CAPACITY. A PARKING PROGRAMS.

01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:15.657
ARE ALSO PART OF THIS CATEGORY

01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:16.191
THOSE ARE TO ENSURE THAT

01:18:16.258 --> 01:18:17.659
STUDENTS LIVE OFF CAMPUS AND

01:18:17.726 --> 01:18:19.094
NEED A CAR TO ENSURE THEY CAN

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:21.263
GET TO THE CLASSES. AND THEIR

01:18:21.329 --> 01:18:23.231
JOBS AND HAVE A PLACE TO PARK.

01:18:23.298 --> 01:18:24.366
INSTANT HEALTH CENTERS WHERE

01:18:24.433 --> 01:18:26.101
STUDENTS ARE GUARANTEED A LEAST

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:28.470
MINIMUM ACCESS TO BASIC HEALTH

01:18:28.537 --> 01:18:31.440
SERVICES ESPECIALLY FOR OUR

01:18:31.506 --> 01:18:31.940
STUDENTS WHO LACK HEALTH

01:18:32.007 --> 01:18:33.608
INSURANCE. SO THESE ARE A

01:18:33.675 --> 01:18:35.210
CRITICAL FUNCTIONS THAT WERE

01:18:35.277 --> 01:18:36.745
CREATED BY STATE LAW MANY YEARS

01:18:36.812 --> 01:18:38.513
AGO IN RECOGNITION OF THE

01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:40.348
NECESSARY SUPPORT THEY PROVIDE

01:18:40.415 --> 01:18:42.484
TO STUDENTS. THESE SELF FUNDED

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.319
PROGRAMS DO NOT RECEIVE GENERAL

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.655
FUND SPORT INSTEAD THEY ARE

01:18:46.721 --> 01:18:49.191
SUPPORTED BY STATE FEES. BUT DO

01:18:49.257 --> 01:18:51.093
TO COPE IN NINETEEN LARGELY

01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:53.195
EMPTING OUR CAMPUSES. THESE

01:18:53.261 --> 01:18:55.330
SELF FUNDED- STUDENT SERVICES

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:56.832
HAVE EXPERIENCED THEIR OWN

01:18:56.898 --> 01:18:59.134
FISCAL CRISES. ADMINISTRATION

01:18:59.201 --> 01:19:00.435
IS DOING THE RIGHT THING BY

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:02.537
PROPOSING THAT FUNDS COULD BE

01:19:02.604 --> 01:19:03.505
TRANSFERRED BETWEEN THESE

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.540
FUNCTIONS TO ENSURE THAT THEY

01:19:05.607 --> 01:19:07.709
REMAIN SOLVENT. WE DO NOT

01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:08.977
ANTICIPATE USING THIS TOOL

01:19:09.044 --> 01:19:10.679
IMMEDIATELY BUT IT IS AN

01:19:10.745 --> 01:19:13.148
IMPORTANT TOOL IN CASE IT

01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:13.782
BECOMES NECESSARY IN THE COMING

01:19:13.849 --> 01:19:16.585
YEARS. AS WE LOOK TO THE FALL

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:18.453
AND THE FUTURE HANDFUL OF

01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:21.823
ITEMS- YOU SHOULD KEEP IN MIND.

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:23.725
FIRST THE CHANCELLOR- RECENTLY

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:24.993
ANNOUNCED THAT ARE PLANNING

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:26.795
APPROACH WILL RESULT IN CC

01:19:26.862 --> 01:19:28.363
COURSES PRIMARILY BEING

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.632
DELIVERED VIRTUALLY. FOR THE

01:19:30.699 --> 01:19:32.767
FALL TWENTY TWENTY TERM. WHAT

01:19:32.834 --> 01:19:34.736
WHAT WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS

01:19:34.803 --> 01:19:36.872
FOR IN PERSON ACTIVITIES THAT

01:19:36.938 --> 01:19:39.641
CANNOT BE DELIVERED VIRTUALLY.

01:19:39.708 --> 01:19:40.876
THERE WILL BE HYBRID APPROACHES

01:19:40.942 --> 01:19:42.310
AND THERE WILL BE VERY ABILITY

01:19:42.377 --> 01:19:43.378
ACROSS THE TWENTY THREE

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:44.779
CAMPUSES DUE TO SPECIFIC

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:48.517
CONTEXT AND CIRCUMSTANCES. A

01:19:48.583 --> 01:19:50.118
PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS PREDICT

01:19:50.185 --> 01:19:51.286
WAVES OF INFECTIONS IN LATE

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:53.788
FALL TWENTY TWENTY AND EARLY

01:19:53.855 --> 01:19:55.390
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. IF YOU WERE

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:57.893
IN. IN A FACE TO FACE MODALITY

01:19:57.959 --> 01:19:59.528
WE WOULD LIKELY HAVE TO SWITCH

01:19:59.594 --> 01:20:01.596
TO A VIRTUAL FORMAT. AND THAT

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:02.764
WOULD COMPROMISE RIGOROUS

01:20:02.831 --> 01:20:05.100
STANDARDS IN SAFETY AS WELL AS

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:07.469
WELFARE. SECOND FOR THE FUTURE

01:20:07.536 --> 01:20:08.336
AS I NOTED EARLIER THE

01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:09.738
UNIVERSITY IS MORE THAN JUST

01:20:09.804 --> 01:20:11.573
ACADEMIC AND STUDENT SUPPORTS

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.875
INCLUDE STATE SIDE STOOD SPORTS

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:16.344
LIKE HEALTH CENTERS. HOUSING

01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:19.114
PARKING STUDENTS CENTERS- UP.

01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:20.515
TO SOMEBODY'S PROGRAM AREAS ARE

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:21.716
UNCHARACTERISTICALLY

01:20:21.783 --> 01:20:23.885
INSIGNIFICANT FISCAL DISTRESS-

01:20:23.952 --> 01:20:25.620
BECAUSE STUDENTS EMPLOYEES OF

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:27.022
THE PUBLIC ARE LARGELY ABSENT

01:20:27.088 --> 01:20:28.857
FROM THE CAMPUSES. IN THESE

01:20:28.924 --> 01:20:29.925
CHALLENGES COULD NEGATIVELY

01:20:29.991 --> 01:20:31.426
IMPACT OTHER AREAS OF THE

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:33.361
UNIVERSITY THAT HASN'T HAPPENED

01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:35.063
YET- BUT WE ARE WORKING TO

01:20:35.130 --> 01:20:37.265
AVOID THAT. BUT WE BUT BE AWARE

01:20:37.332 --> 01:20:39.100
THAT IT COULD BECOME A SERIOUS

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:41.503
CHALLENGES FUTURE. THIRD OF

01:20:41.570 --> 01:20:43.305
PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATIONHAS TO

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:45.440
BE A PRIORITY IN THE STATE NOW

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:47.342
INTO THE FUTURE. REMEMBER THE

01:20:47.409 --> 01:20:48.643

01:20:48.710 --> 01:20:49.811

PIVOTAL ROLE THAT WE WILL HAVE

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:53.401
IN CALIFORNIA'S RECOVERY. TEN

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:56.137
YEARS AGO CUTS THE CALIFORNIA

IN COLLEGE TRAINS. INTO DRASTIC

01:22:57.806 --> 01:22:59.207
DECLINE IN ACCESS CUTTING

STUDENTS FROM HIGHER EDUCATION

01:23:03.578 --> 01:23:05.547
MANY OF WHOM NEVER CAME BACK.

01:23:05.613 --> 01:23:06.981
THAT TRANSLATED DIRECTLY INTO

WIDE IN THE CALIFORNIA'S DEGREE

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:14.656
GAP. HUH THE GREATEST RISK THAT

01:23:14.723 --> 01:23:16.624
WE NOW FACE IS THAT THESE CUTS

01:23:16.691 --> 01:23:19.861
WILL. WILL LIMIT OUR PROGRESS

01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:20.862
THAT WE'VE MADE TOWARDS

01:23:20.929 --> 01:23:22.664
EQUITABLE SUCCESS IN SOME OF

01:23:22.731 --> 01:23:24.165
THE GOALS OUTLINED IN THE

01:23:24.232 --> 01:23:26.234
VISION FOR SUCCESS WE CANNOT

01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:28.937
ALLOW HISTORY TO REPEAT ITSELF

01:23:29.003 --> 01:23:30.638
AND MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THESE

01:23:30.705 --> 01:23:32.040
CUTS WILL NOT BE

01:23:32.107 --> 01:23:35.110

01:23:40.382 --> 01:23:42.117
FOR EQUITY IN ACCESS WE ARE

01:23:42.183 --> 01:23:44.486
CONCERNED THAT DEEP CUTS WILL

01:39:44.378 --> 01:39:48.782
GALLAGHER THE FIRST ELEMENT

01:39:48.849 --> 01:39:52.519
THAT WAS. DETERMINED WAS WHAT

01:39:52.586 --> 01:39:55.789
IS THE BEST- BEST THING MOVING

01:39:55.856 --> 01:39:58.158
FORWARD FOR OUR STUDENTS. LOTS

01:39:58.225 --> 01:39:59.226
AND LOTS OF CONSULTATION

01:39:59.293 --> 01:40:01.795
INTERNALLY WITHIN THE C. ISSUE-

01:40:01.862 --> 01:40:03.163
AMONG THE PRESIDENTS OF EACH

01:40:03.230 --> 01:40:05.265
THESE CAMPUSES AND THE SENIOR

01:40:05.332 --> 01:40:08.869
LEADERSHIP OF THE- OF THE

01:40:08.936 --> 01:40:11.472
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. I THINK

01:40:11.538 --> 01:40:12.840
ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND IS

01:40:12.906 --> 01:40:14.007
THAT SOMETIMES HEADLINES IN

01:40:14.074 --> 01:40:17.044
NEWSPAPERS ARE MISLEADING AND

01:40:17.111 --> 01:40:18.345
SOMETIMES INFORMATION GETS

01:40:18.412 --> 01:40:19.380
TWEAKED A LITTLE BIT

01:40:19.446 --> 01:40:21.348
INCORRECTLY WHEN- I'M FAMILIAR

01:40:21.415 --> 01:40:24.418
WITH THAT YEAH UP WHAT WE'RE

01:40:24.485 --> 01:40:26.353
DOING IS WE'RE PLANNING FOR A

01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:29.189
VIRTUAL DELIVERY FOR THE FALL

01:40:29.256 --> 01:40:31.425
AND FOR THE WINTER. AND THE

01:40:31.492 --> 01:40:34.862
IDEA HERE IS THAT WE ARE TRYING

01:40:34.928 --> 01:40:36.430
TO BE THE MOST EQUIPPED AND

01:40:36.497 --> 01:40:39.066
BEST EQUIPPED TO BE ABLE TO

01:40:39.133 --> 01:40:41.635
DELIVER THE BEST INSTRUCTION WE

01:40:41.702 --> 01:40:42.970
CAN'T POSSIBLY. ONE OF THOSE

01:40:43.036 --> 01:40:44.738
WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN BE THE

01:40:44.805 --> 01:40:46.106
MOST EFFECTIVE WITH OUR

01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:48.208
STUDENTS IS TO BE ABLE TO

01:40:48.275 --> 01:40:49.276
PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL

01:40:49.343 --> 01:40:50.344
DEVELOPMENT ADDITIONAL

01:40:50.411 --> 01:40:51.478
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT MORE

01:40:51.545 --> 01:40:53.046
THAN WE ALREADY HAVE. TO OFFER

01:40:53.113 --> 01:40:54.515
FACULTY TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER

01:40:54.581 --> 01:40:57.017
EVEN A BETTER INSTRUCTIONAL OF

01:40:57.084 --> 01:40:59.653
ANALOGY. IN THIS IN THIS TOUGH

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.822
SITUATION. SO I THINK WHAT THIS

01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:03.657
DOES IS IT ALLOWS FOR US TO BE

01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:05.392
NIMBLE GOING FORWARD THE

01:41:05.459 --> 01:41:06.960
CHALLENGES THAT CHANCE ARE

01:41:07.027 --> 01:41:08.095
MENTIONED AT A RECENT BOARD

01:41:08.162 --> 01:41:11.398
MEETING IS IF WE DECIDED TO GO

01:41:11.465 --> 01:41:13.300
IN PERSON. YEAH I KNOW THAT'S

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:15.102
IDEAL THE WHAT EVERYBODY WOULD

01:41:15.169 --> 01:41:16.003
LOVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT'S

01:41:16.069 --> 01:41:17.871
OUR GREATEST A WHILE THE STREAM

01:41:17.938 --> 01:41:20.541
TO BE BACK- NOT TALKING TO

01:41:20.607 --> 01:41:21.175
PEOPLE WITH MASKS AND THAT SORT

01:41:21.241 --> 01:41:24.044
OF THING. IF WE GO IN PERSON

01:41:24.111 --> 01:41:25.746
AND THEN ABRUPTLY HAVE TO DO

01:41:25.813 --> 01:41:27.147
WHAT WE DID IN MARCH IT IS

01:41:27.214 --> 01:41:29.149
INCREDIBLY DISRUPTIVE TO ALL

01:41:29.216 --> 01:41:32.419
ELEMENTS OF. COMMUNITIES AND

01:41:32.486 --> 01:41:34.855
ESPECIALLY THE STUDENTS. AND

01:41:34.922 --> 01:41:35.456
FACULTY IN OUR STATE THAT HAVE

01:41:35.522 --> 01:41:36.990
TO DO WOULD HAVE TO REPEAT THIS

01:41:37.057 --> 01:41:38.725
AGAIN. BUT THERE A COUPLE BUT

01:41:38.792 --> 01:41:40.160
INSTEAD TO THINK THROUGH TO

01:41:40.227 --> 01:41:41.862
HERE THIS IS NOT A ONE SIZE

01:41:41.929 --> 01:41:43.297
FITS ALL APPROACH SO THE

01:41:43.363 --> 01:41:45.132
ARTICLE HEADLINES THAT WAS

01:41:45.199 --> 01:41:46.934
TELLING YOU ABOUT- ARE SAYING

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:47.968
THAT YOU KNOW SEE ISSUE GOING

01:41:48.035 --> 01:41:49.303
ALL ONLINE. AND THAT MIGHT BE

01:41:49.369 --> 01:41:51.238
THE PERIOD BEHIND IT. OVER

01:41:51.305 --> 01:41:52.573
PLANNING FOR PLANNING THAT

01:41:52.639 --> 01:41:54.341
DIRECTION BUT THEY'RE GONNA BE

01:41:54.408 --> 01:41:55.976
INSTANCES WHERE THAT'S NOT

01:41:56.043 --> 01:41:58.378
PRACTICAL NURSING STUDENTS WHO

01:41:58.445 --> 01:42:00.147
HAVE THAT PRACTICAL RIGHT.

01:42:00.214 --> 01:42:01.982
THERE ARE GONNA BE AGRICULTURAL

01:42:02.049 --> 01:42:03.984
STUDENTS WHO HAVE TO BE IN THE

01:42:04.051 --> 01:42:06.053
FIELDS AND LEARNING HOW THAT

01:42:06.119 --> 01:42:09.790
TRACTOROPERATES AND HOW TO. DO

01:42:09.857 --> 01:42:13.193
SOIL SAMPLE. SORTS OF OUR TO BE

01:42:13.260 --> 01:42:14.928
A OF HIS BY K. REVIEW. THE

01:42:14.995 --> 01:42:17.030
CHAIR OFFICE. PROVIDED

01:42:17.097 --> 01:42:18.098
EXEMPTION. SO THAT IN THOSE

01:42:18.165 --> 01:42:20.234
INSTANCES WHERE. ENGINEERING

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:21.735
STUDENTS NEED TO DO THEIR

01:42:21.802 --> 01:42:23.103
CAPSTONE AND IT IS A PHYSICAL

01:42:23.170 --> 01:42:25.105
EXPERIENCE. THAT THERE WILL BE

01:42:25.172 --> 01:42:26.940
AN APPROPRIATE WAIVER WHERE

01:42:27.007 --> 01:42:30.677
JUSTIFIED. AND SECONDLY. THAT

01:42:30.744 --> 01:42:32.379
THERE IS A APPROPRIATE PP AND

01:42:32.446 --> 01:42:34.181
SOCIAL DISTANCING. THE OTHER

01:42:34.248 --> 01:42:36.650
FACTOR TO OF COURSE BUT TWENTY

01:42:36.717 --> 01:42:39.653
THREE CAMPUSES SPREAD ACROSS TO

01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:40.187
EIGHT HUNDRED NINE HUNDRED

01:42:40.254 --> 01:42:41.121
MILES OF THIS. GREAT STATE OF

01:42:41.188 --> 01:42:43.156
OURS- UP WHERE YOU HAVE I ONLY

01:42:43.223 --> 01:42:46.760
DID IT AS SITUATIONS LOCALLY.

01:42:46.827 --> 01:42:48.028
WHAT'S GOING ON L. LATE IN IN

01:42:48.095 --> 01:42:50.998
THE LA BASIN IT. THE MID

01:42:51.064 --> 01:42:51.765
NINETEEN IT'S GOING TO BE

01:42:51.832 --> 01:42:54.401
GROSSLY DIFFERENT THAN THAN

01:42:54.468 --> 01:42:56.570
YOUR BELOVED CHICO STATE. SO

01:42:56.637 --> 01:43:00.173
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE NOT

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:01.875
SEEING A PLAN TO PLAN FOR. IN

01:43:01.942 --> 01:43:03.644
THOSE INSTANCES WHERE WE CAN GO

01:43:03.710 --> 01:43:05.546
PHYSICAL WE CAN AND WHERE IT'S

01:43:05.612 --> 01:43:09.416
APPROPRIATE BUT- BUT I THINK

01:43:09.483 --> 01:43:12.586
GENERALLY SPEAKING OUR GOAL IS

01:43:12.653 --> 01:43:14.087
TO ALWAYS KEEP THE STUDENTS IN

01:43:14.154 --> 01:43:16.423
IN MIND FIRST. WE WOULD ALL

01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:17.691
LOVE TO DO FACE TO FACE WE

01:43:17.758 --> 01:43:19.126
WOULD ALL LOVE TO HAVE THAT

01:43:19.192 --> 01:43:22.062
OPPORTUNITY AGAIN. BUT BECAUSE

01:43:22.129 --> 01:43:23.497
OF THE CURRENT SITUATION WE

01:43:23.564 --> 01:43:25.799
NEED TO BE CAREFUL. SAFETY

01:43:25.866 --> 01:43:28.168
PERSPECTIVE AND IN. APPROPRIATE

01:43:28.235 --> 01:43:29.570
SO THAT STUDENTS ARE ACHIEVING

01:43:29.636 --> 01:43:30.904
THE BEST LEARNING OUTCOMES

01:43:30.971 --> 01:43:32.706
POSSIBLE AND NOT HAVING AGAIN

01:43:32.773 --> 01:43:34.641
TO REPEAT. POTENTIALLY OF WHERE

01:43:34.708 --> 01:43:37.678
IT'S INCREDIBLY DISRUPTIVE AT

01:43:37.744 --> 01:43:38.912
SOME VARIOUS IN CRITICAL POINTS

01:43:38.979 --> 01:43:40.547
I MEAN. ONE OF THE WHEN THE

01:43:40.614 --> 01:43:41.782
FORECAST FOR LATE FALL THAT

01:43:41.848 --> 01:43:43.884
COULD BE A PERFECT STORM RIGHT

01:43:43.951 --> 01:43:46.587
BEFORE- A FINALS WHERE DUDLEY

01:43:46.653 --> 01:43:48.956
YOUR YOUR WORK ALL SEMESTER OR

01:43:49.022 --> 01:43:51.825
ALL QUARTER. TO A GRINDING HALT

01:43:51.892 --> 01:43:54.695
SO WE WANT TO BE AS AS PREPARED

01:43:54.761 --> 01:43:59.967
AS POSSIBLE. GIVE US MUCH OP.

01:44:00.033 --> 01:44:04.037
STILL TO BE ABLE TO DO NOT ONLY

01:44:04.104 --> 01:44:09.209
GET THEIR DEGREES TO ACT. I

01:44:09.276 --> 01:44:10.177
WOULD THINK THANK YOU FOR THAT

01:44:10.243 --> 01:44:11.645
ANSWER AND THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR

01:44:11.712 --> 01:44:13.380
KIND OF MORE THE DETAILS OF HOW

01:44:13.447 --> 01:44:15.182
THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE.

01:44:15.248 --> 01:44:18.251
WORKING OUT. THE KIND OF

01:44:18.318 --> 01:44:21.555
SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY'S HEARING

01:44:21.622 --> 01:44:23.223
I WANT TO DELVE INTO THIS ISSUE

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:26.026
OF YOU KNOW. IN THE REVISE THE

01:44:26.093 --> 01:44:29.062
GOVERNOR IS SAYING. LOOK WE ARE

01:44:29.129 --> 01:44:31.632
GOING TO- HAVE SOME PRETTY

01:44:31.698 --> 01:44:32.766
DRASTIC CUTS REALLY BASICALLY A

01:44:32.833 --> 01:44:36.770
10% CUT ACROSS THE BOARD AT ALL

01:44:36.837 --> 01:44:39.473
OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION. AN

01:44:39.539 --> 01:44:40.073
INSANE BUT WILL TRIGGER THOSE

01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:42.776
OFF. IF WE GET SUFFICIENT

01:44:42.843 --> 01:44:45.779
FEDERAL FUNDS WELL THE REALITY

01:44:45.846 --> 01:44:48.882
IS WE DID GET FEDERAL FUNDS-

01:44:48.949 --> 01:44:49.449
FOR OUR HIGHER EDUCATION IN

01:44:49.516 --> 01:44:52.886
FACT- THE CARES ACT THE FIRST

01:44:52.953 --> 01:44:56.289
ONE- CAME THROUGH WITH ONE

01:44:56.356 --> 01:44:57.057
POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IS

01:44:57.124 --> 01:45:00.594
ULTIMATELY WHAT I COME THROUGH

01:45:00.661 --> 01:45:01.128
FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE

01:45:01.194 --> 01:45:02.229
MILLION FOR A COMMUNITY

01:45:02.295 --> 01:45:03.730
COLLEGES. HAVE INTERNED FIVE

01:45:03.797 --> 01:45:07.367
MILLION FOR SEAT YOU AND TURN

01:45:07.434 --> 01:45:08.935
SIXTY MILLION FOR YOU SEE. HALF

01:45:09.002 --> 01:45:11.104
OF THOSE FUNDS BEING CREATED

01:45:11.171 --> 01:45:13.173
FOR FINANCIAL AID. SO GET MY

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:15.308
QUESTION BECOMES WHY DON'T WE

01:45:15.375 --> 01:45:17.444
TRIGGER THAT OFF RIGHT NOW-

01:45:17.511 --> 01:45:18.945
SOON BE AS THOUGH WE DID GET

01:45:19.012 --> 01:45:20.313
FEDERAL FUNDS THE FED THE

01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:22.082
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. HAS IN FACT

01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:25.152
COME THROUGH. WITH SUPPORTS FOR

01:45:25.218 --> 01:45:27.054
HIGHER EDUCATION. AND SO

01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:29.923
CONSIDERING THAT FACT MAYBE WE

01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.490
SHOULD START TRIGGERING OFF

01:45:30.557 --> 01:45:32.192
THESE CUTS. RIGHT NOW OMIT

01:45:32.259 --> 01:45:34.594
DOESN'T PULL OUT A SENSE TO BE

01:45:34.661 --> 01:45:36.496
PULLING BACK STATE AID- IN

01:45:36.563 --> 01:45:37.798
SUPPORT AND INCLUDING.

01:45:37.864 --> 01:45:40.333
FINANCIAL AID I MEAN WE'RE

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:40.901
GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS

01:45:40.967 --> 01:45:44.304
WELL- BUT I QUESTION TO DO

01:45:44.371 --> 01:45:46.173
LAUGH- WHOEVER WANTS TO ANSWER

01:45:46.239 --> 01:45:49.076
THIS WOULD BE. YOU KNOW WHY IT

01:45:49.142 --> 01:45:49.810
WHY NOT TRIGGER OFF SOME OF

01:45:49.876 --> 01:45:52.245
THOSE CUTS. RIGHT NOW

01:45:52.312 --> 01:45:53.280
CONSIDERING THAT WE HAVE SEAT

01:45:53.346 --> 01:45:55.816
RECEIVED SUBSTANTIAL. FEDERAL

01:45:55.882 --> 01:45:58.318
SUPPORT FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN

01:45:58.385 --> 01:46:02.756
THE STATE. YEAH IN A FINANCE I

01:46:02.823 --> 01:46:04.858
THINK- WHAT WE WOULD SAY TO

01:46:04.925 --> 01:46:06.126
THAT IS THAT THESE RESOURCES

01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:09.730
CAN ASSIST OUR UNIVERSITIES ARE

01:46:09.796 --> 01:46:14.034
IN- MITIGATING THE IMPACTS OF

01:46:14.101 --> 01:46:16.703
THE PROPOSED REDUCTIONS BUT WE

01:46:16.770 --> 01:46:18.538
ALSO KNOW THAT THEY ARE A

01:46:18.605 --> 01:46:19.840
DIGITAL COSTS AS WELL AS

01:46:19.906 --> 01:46:25.178
HELPING STE A I. A MAIN DISH

01:46:25.245 --> 01:46:27.547
EARNING. THOSE RESOURCES ARE TO

01:46:27.614 --> 01:46:32.085
THE IN COVERING THE COSTS-

01:46:32.152 --> 01:46:35.055
ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPOSED-

01:46:35.122 --> 01:46:36.757
REDUCTIONS RIGHT BUT THEY

01:46:36.823 --> 01:46:38.992
STEPPED UP SO WHERE WE BACKING

01:46:39.059 --> 01:46:43.430
OFF. I THINK FROM FROM OUR

01:46:43.497 --> 01:46:46.633
PERSPECTIVE. WE HAVE ALSO WE

01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:48.335
ARE AWARE THAT THE UNIVERSITIES

01:46:48.401 --> 01:46:50.504
HAVE ADDITIONAL COSTS

01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:53.306
ASSOCIATED WITH A CODE NINETEEN

01:46:53.373 --> 01:46:54.708
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:46:54.775 --> 01:46:57.611
MITIGATING THE IMPACTS TO OUR

01:46:57.677 --> 01:46:58.745
MOST UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENT

01:46:58.812 --> 01:47:03.517
POPULATIONS. WHY I STILL DON'T

01:47:03.583 --> 01:47:04.684
HEAR MUCH OF AN ANSWER THERE

01:47:04.751 --> 01:47:06.820
BUT LOOK AT I MEAN FOR ME AND

01:47:06.887 --> 01:47:11.191
FROM MY STANDPOINT HE WAS THE

01:47:11.258 --> 01:47:12.726
THIS ROOM RECOGNIZE HOW

01:47:12.793 --> 01:47:15.028
IMPORTANT ARE HIGHER EDUCATION

01:47:15.095 --> 01:47:17.464
SYSTEMS ARE- ANY OF COMMUNITY

01:47:17.531 --> 01:47:20.066
COLLEGES ALTHOUGH KENYA. TO THE

01:47:20.133 --> 01:47:22.235
CS USED TO THE UC'S. NO AS I

01:47:22.302 --> 01:47:24.304
JUST TALKED ABOUT CHICO STATE

01:47:24.371 --> 01:47:25.872
SERVING STUDENTS THROUGHOUT.

01:47:25.939 --> 01:47:27.474
THE STATE AND THAT IS AND THAT

01:47:27.541 --> 01:47:29.042
IS THE CASE IN ALL OF OUR

01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:31.478
UNIVERSITIES A BY CRITICAL.

DIRE SITUATION YOU KNOW HUGE

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:50.230
REVENUE SHORTFALL. AS A RESULT

01:47:50.297 --> 01:47:54.568

EVEN MORE SO BUDGET SEEM TO BE

01:48:00.006 --> 01:48:03.777
ABOUT PRIORITIES. AND CERTAINLY

01:48:03.844 --> 01:48:05.478
ARE HIGHER EDUCATION EVERYTHING

01:48:05.545 --> 01:48:09.216
THAT THEY PROVIDE- SHOULD BE A

01:48:09.282 --> 01:48:11.251
PRIORITY IN THIS AND ESPECIALLY

01:48:11.318 --> 01:48:12.719

THE FEDERAL SUPPORT THAT WE

01:48:37.611 --> 01:48:39.813
HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED. AND

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:41.081
REALLY LOOK CAN WE KIND OF KEEP

01:48:41.147 --> 01:48:43.149
THESE THINGS AS AS STABLE AS

01:48:43.216 --> 01:48:46.019
POSSIBLE- MAYBE JUST TWO MORE

QUICK QUESTIONS ONE. IN THE

01:48:49.723 --> 01:48:52.759
FINANCIAL AID PORTION. IT LOOKS

01:48:52.826 --> 01:48:55.095
LIKE WE'RE CUTTING I THINK IT'S

01:48:55.161 --> 01:48:58.498
11% IN CAL GRANTS TO PRIVATE

01:48:58.565 --> 01:49:00.767
UNIVERSITIES. AND SECONDARY

01:49:00.834 --> 01:49:03.370
INSTITUTIONS WHY THE INEQUITY

01:49:03.436 --> 01:49:05.372
THERE WERE FOCUSING REALLY AND

01:49:05.438 --> 01:49:07.474
SEEMS LIKE REALLY TARGETED

01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:09.776
FINANCIAL AID CUTS TO THE

01:49:09.843 --> 01:49:12.112

01:49:19.586 --> 01:49:25.992
THE. HI I LIKE TRAVIS WITH THE

01:49:26.059 --> 01:49:29.429
PAYMENT. FINANCE THEY'RE JUST

01:49:29.496 --> 01:49:31.898
MINUTES SIMPLY AND I JUST WANT

01:49:31.965 --> 01:49:38.605
TO ADDRESS CURRENT LAW. I'M

01:49:38.672 --> 01:49:40.307
BETTING QUITE HERE YET COULD

CURRENT ASSETS THE AMOUNT OF

01:49:52.953 --> 01:49:55.488
THE AWARD FOR THE PRIVATE

01:49:55.555 --> 01:49:57.624
NONPROFIT INSTITUTIONS. THEY

01:49:57.691 --> 01:49:59.459
HAD A TARGET FOR TRANSFER

01:49:59.526 --> 01:50:01.895
STUDENTS AND THE CITIZENS DID

01:50:01.962 --> 01:50:06.900

TRANSFER STUDENTS. AND THAT'S

01:50:11.771 --> 01:50:14.541
WHY THE REDUCTION IS MORE THEIR.

01:50:14.607 --> 01:50:16.509
CORRECT THERE IS THAT IT'S

01:50:16.576 --> 01:50:19.179
TOUGH TO THREE- REQUIREMENTS

01:50:19.245 --> 01:50:21.548

PLACE OF HIGHER LEARNING THAT

ARE STILL TRYING TO MAINTAIN

01:50:38.798 --> 01:50:41.634
THAT EDUCATION THAT NEEDS TO.

01:50:41.701 --> 01:50:45.839
WHAT. DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE

01:50:45.905 --> 01:50:48.742
SHOULD BE FAVORING ONE FORM OF.

01:50:48.808 --> 01:50:50.610
EDUCATION OVER THE OTHERS THESE

01:50:50.677 --> 01:50:52.345
PEOPLE STILL NEED SUPPORT TO BE

01:50:52.412 --> 01:50:54.948
ABLE TO GET THEIR EDUCATION SO-

01:50:55.015 --> 01:50:56.649

OF FINANCE SO AS MY COLLEAGUE

01:51:12.766 --> 01:51:14.501
EVERY ELEMENT EXPLAINING THIS

01:51:14.567 --> 01:51:17.203
IS A TECHNICAL- ENACTMENT OF

01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:18.438
CURRENT LAW. AS THE IT

01:51:18.505 --> 01:51:19.773

CAL GRANT AMOUNT. IS REDUCED.

01:51:24.811 --> 01:51:26.513
HOWEVER SHOULD THEY BE ABLE TO

01:51:26.579 --> 01:51:27.647
MEET THOSE TARGETS AS THEY ERE

01:51:27.714 --> 01:51:29.315

CURRENT FISCAL YEAR OUR NEXT

01:51:39.092 --> 01:51:41.161
FISCAL YEAR. IF THEY WERE TO

01:51:41.227 --> 01:51:43.263

AUTOMATICALLY GO UP TO THE

01:51:47.267 --> 01:51:49.069
ORIGINAL AMOUNT I'M SURE THEY

01:51:49.135 --> 01:51:53.106

OKAY GOOD IN ON ME BECAUSE I

01:52:04.617 --> 01:52:06.252

THE PRO LEVEL SERVICE. THESE

WERE BASED AS WELL AS TUITION

01:54:52.151 --> 01:54:54.220
WAS. BUT IT'S PREMATURE AT THIS

01:54:54.287 --> 01:54:57.924

TURNOVER OF ABOUT 5% I DON'T

02:14:20.519 --> 02:14:21.787
THINK WE'RE MUCH DIFFERENT THAN

02:14:21.853 --> 02:14:23.388
IN THE YEAR. THAT WILL YIELD

02:14:23.455 --> 02:14:25.424
TEMPORARY IS WELL AS WELL AS IF

02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:27.292
WE WERE TO HOLD THOSE POSITIONS

02:14:27.359 --> 02:14:29.628
OPEN- IT. OR LIMIT SEC

02:14:29.694 --> 02:14:33.865
POSITIONS SO WE HAVE A NUMBER.

02:14:33.932 --> 02:14:36.067
IS AVAILABLE ON. THE FORGET WE

02:14:36.134 --> 02:14:38.437
ALSO HAVE THIS THING NO. NOT

02:14:38.503 --> 02:14:40.205
TRAVEL. WE'VE I THINK ALL OF US

02:14:40.272 --> 02:14:42.107
ALL OF TESTIFIED TO THE TWO

02:14:42.174 --> 02:14:43.542
DOCKING THAT OUT AND SIMPLY

02:14:43.608 --> 02:14:46.244
BECAUSE- BASICALLY CAN'T

02:14:46.311 --> 02:14:47.212
TROUBLES IS ANYWAY. SO THAT IN

02:14:47.279 --> 02:14:49.014
THE IN THE SHORT TERM WE CAN WE

02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:50.816
CAN PIECE IT TOGETHER. ITHINK

02:14:50.882 --> 02:14:52.217
THE ONE THING THAT WILL OCCUR

02:14:52.284 --> 02:14:54.686
AND IT'S GREAT THAT YOU'RE

02:14:54.753 --> 02:14:57.422
ASKING THIS QUESTION. IS THAT

02:14:57.489 --> 02:14:59.758
IF THIS IS A REPEAT IF IT ENDS

02:14:59.825 --> 02:15:01.092
UP BEING A REPEAT LIKE THE

02:15:01.159 --> 02:15:02.894
GREAT RISK BACK. FROM TWO

02:15:02.961 --> 02:15:04.830
THOUSAND EIGHT ON THROUGH A

02:15:04.896 --> 02:15:06.298
TWENTY ELEVEN TWENTY TWELVE. AT

02:15:06.364 --> 02:15:09.835
AS THESE ONE TIME SOLUTIONS DRY

02:15:09.901 --> 02:15:15.006
UP. AS WE DEPLETE. AT YOU CAN'T.

02:15:15.073 --> 02:15:18.844
WE CAN'T BOIL. TIME WE WILL I

02:15:18.910 --> 02:15:21.046
TURNED IT MORE PAY IS TO PLOY

02:15:21.112 --> 02:15:22.914
THOSE BE IN DROPS THOSE COULD

02:15:22.981 --> 02:15:25.851
BE TUITION. THOSE COULD BE A

02:15:25.917 --> 02:15:27.886
HOST OF THINGS THAT CAN BE MORE

02:15:27.953 --> 02:15:30.422
ON GOING AND MORE PAINFUL TO

02:15:30.489 --> 02:15:33.024
THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE BOTH IN

02:15:33.091 --> 02:15:36.261
THE INSTRUCTOR WORLD AS IN THE

02:15:36.328 --> 02:15:39.564
SUPPORT WORLD WE HOPE WE DON'T

02:15:39.631 --> 02:15:43.201
THERE ARE AT THIS POINT. WE

02:15:43.268 --> 02:15:45.036
BOARD. DAY MANY OF THEM STATED

02:15:45.103 --> 02:15:48.206
BOTH AT NO. FROM THEIR VANTAGE

02:15:48.273 --> 02:15:49.608
THEIR PERSONAL VANTAGE POINT OR

02:15:49.674 --> 02:15:51.676
DESIRE FOR THERE TO BE A TO

02:15:51.743 --> 02:15:54.012
INCREASE NOT TIME WILL TELL AS

02:15:54.079 --> 02:15:56.414
WE GO FOR RIGHT IF THIS IS

02:15:56.481 --> 02:15:58.850
WORST AND THE GROUP SESSION. AN

02:15:58.917 --> 02:16:01.219
OBVIOUS ALL THE OPTION AFTER.

02:16:01.286 --> 02:16:03.522
ABLE THAT'S THAT'S THE REALITY

02:16:03.588 --> 02:16:04.956
GOING FORWARD I THINK WE ARE IN

02:16:05.023 --> 02:16:06.525
A PRETTY GOOD SHAPE TO START

02:16:06.591 --> 02:16:09.261
HERE- WE HAVE LIKE LIKE THE

02:16:09.327 --> 02:16:11.630
STATE HAS A RAINY DAY FUND THAT

02:16:11.696 --> 02:16:15.033
HAS PAID OFF A COUPLE OF THOSE

02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:17.802
DEBT. FOR RECEPTIONS. IT

02:16:17.869 --> 02:16:19.371
ADDITION. TO SEE ISSUE. BUT

02:16:19.437 --> 02:16:21.606
MARCHES ON AND THEN. AS THE

02:16:21.673 --> 02:16:23.008
ADMINISTRATION SIX THAT THIS IS

02:16:23.074 --> 02:16:25.143
A FOUR YEARS WORTH OF PAIN AND

02:16:25.210 --> 02:16:26.444
RECURRING SITUATED WHERE

02:16:26.511 --> 02:16:30.982
PERHAPS THE UNIVERSITY SAYS.

02:16:31.049 --> 02:16:33.785
OUR SO TO SPEAK WE THE-

02:16:33.852 --> 02:16:35.020
QUESTION THEN THE BE CHALLENGES

02:16:35.086 --> 02:16:37.222
WHERE- FEES WILL BE ON THE

02:16:37.289 --> 02:16:40.659
TABLE TO WHICH WILL BE ON THE

02:16:40.725 --> 02:16:43.862
TABLE OTHER MEN OF WHERE YOU

02:16:43.929 --> 02:16:46.665
ARE NOT ALL THAT SUCH A SET.

02:16:46.731 --> 02:16:47.198
REALITY WHAT WERE. WE CAN

02:16:47.265 --> 02:16:49.000
AVOID. BOTH WORK FOR IT MAKE

02:16:49.067 --> 02:16:51.736
SURE THAT AS WE ROLL FORWARD

02:16:51.803 --> 02:16:54.573
THAT WE ARE PUTTING IN PLACE

02:16:54.639 --> 02:16:56.675
THINGS THAT ARE. JEFF ENOUGH SO

02:16:56.741 --> 02:16:58.109
THAT WE DON'T. STUDENTS TUITION

02:16:58.176 --> 02:17:00.445
INCREASES JUST SO THAT WE ARE

02:17:00.512 --> 02:17:04.249
NOT HAVING TO EMPLOY. SO THAT

02:17:04.316 --> 02:17:05.617
THE EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION SORTS

02:17:05.684 --> 02:17:08.053
OF THINGS THAT HAVE EMPLOYED SO

02:17:08.119 --> 02:17:10.188
WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO MITIGATE

02:17:10.255 --> 02:17:13.592
WITH AT LEAST AT. THE LEAST

02:17:13.658 --> 02:17:15.961
AMOUNT OF ECONOMIC PAIN AS

02:17:16.027 --> 02:17:17.929
POSSIBLE THAT'S AT LEAST FOR

02:17:17.996 --> 02:17:21.499
THE SEAT. UP VERY MUCH OF THAT

02:17:21.566 --> 02:17:25.036
AS WATER CLARITY. OF YEAH

02:17:25.103 --> 02:17:26.905
BECAUSE OF GOOD NUYS THAT YOU

02:17:26.972 --> 02:17:27.572
KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF

02:17:27.639 --> 02:17:29.207
DISCUSSION FROM THE APARTMENT

02:17:29.274 --> 02:17:31.276
FINANCE AND ALSO FROM THE

02:17:31.343 --> 02:17:33.411
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST ABOUT THE

02:17:33.478 --> 02:17:35.046
DURATION OF THAT. AND BOB THAT

02:17:35.113 --> 02:17:36.648
IS SHORTER RATHER THAN LONGER

02:17:36.715 --> 02:17:38.817
BUT IT'S VERY UNLIKELY TO BE A

02:17:38.883 --> 02:17:40.085
SINGLE YEAR OF THAT FROM THE

02:17:40.151 --> 02:17:41.453
STANDPOINT OF THE A SHORTFALL

02:17:41.519 --> 02:17:44.522
IN STATE REVENUES SO IN ALMOST

02:17:44.589 --> 02:17:45.924
CERTAINLY WE ARE HAVING THE

02:17:45.991 --> 02:17:50.629
SAME DISCUSSION. YEAR AND- BE

02:17:50.695 --> 02:17:56.668
EVEN THE- SUBTLE I PLAN TO YOUR

LEGISLATURE TO IDENTIFY A

02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:10.775
FLEXIBILITY IN AREAS WHERE IT

02:19:10.842 --> 02:19:15.146

WE ARE EXPECTING A ONE POINT

02:19:39.771 --> 02:19:41.339
FIVE BILLION DOLLAR CUT THESE

02:19:41.406 --> 02:19:43.241
ARE EXTENSIVELY DEEP A MUCH

02:19:43.308 --> 02:19:44.542
DEEPER THAN WE SAW DURING THE

02:19:44.609 --> 02:19:46.544
GREAT RECESSION IN THAT SHORT.

02:19:46.611 --> 02:19:48.613

ENROLLMENT. IT IT'S UNCERTAIN

02:20:02.427 --> 02:20:05.029
WHAT WE WILL SEE AT THIS TIME-

02:20:05.096 --> 02:20:07.632
WE DURING THE SOME OF OUR

UNFORTUNATELY PAS OUT OR DROP

02:20:14.405 --> 02:20:17.108

OUR PROGRAMS AVAILABLE HERE WE

02:20:56.414 --> 02:20:57.715
WILL CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE ARM

02:20:57.782 --> 02:21:00.885
PROGRAMS- SUCH AS C. T. E. IT

02:21:00.952 --> 02:21:03.454
HARD TO CONVERT COURSES WITHOUT

DIFFERENT WAYS AND THEN WITH

02:21:17.302 --> 02:21:19.504
REGARDS TO THE IMPACT OF ON

02:21:19.571 --> 02:21:21.773
COLLEGES EACH WILL HAVE A

02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:22.907
DIFFERENT WAY OF ABSORBING THE

02:21:22.974 --> 02:21:26.244
SOME OF THEM MAY HAVE BUILT OUT

02:21:26.311 --> 02:21:27.145
RESERVISTS I CAN BE ADDRESS.

02:21:27.212 --> 02:21:28.313

FINING SITUATE SHIN SO THE

02:21:31.082 --> 02:21:32.517
IMPACT WILL HAVE VERY DIFFERENT

02:21:32.584 --> 02:21:34.853
OF. THE IMPACT WILL BE VERY

02:21:34.919 --> 02:21:37.422
DIFFERENT IN OUR HUNDRED FIFTY

TO BE DONE THE NEXT COUPLE

02:31:29.513 --> 02:31:32.817
WEEKS. ON THIS FRONT CERTAINLY

02:31:32.883 --> 02:31:35.152
IT WOULD ALL GO AWAY IN GEORGIA

02:31:35.219 --> 02:31:35.853
BUT FOR THIS YEAR'S CATS WITH

02:31:35.920 --> 02:31:37.455
AN ACTION FROM THE FEDERAL

02:31:37.521 --> 02:31:39.623

REALLY CREATE OPTION AND

02:31:47.765 --> 02:31:49.934
FRANKLY- I THINK THERE AS I

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.035
SAID YESTERDAY I THOUGHT THERE

02:31:51.101 --> 02:31:53.037
PROBABLY WERE MORE OPTIONS LIKE

WE DIDN'T SEE ANY. NOT ANY

02:31:58.542 --> 02:32:00.110
THERE WEREN'T AS MANY OPTIONS

02:32:00.177 --> 02:32:02.780
YESTERDAY- WHAT DO YOU THINK

02:32:02.847 --> 02:32:05.416
ABOUT SOME OF THESE- SO WE

02:32:05.483 --> 02:32:07.751
WON'T HAVE TO DO THIS ARBITRARY

02:32:07.818 --> 02:32:09.954
10% ACROSS THE BOARD. WHICH

02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:11.522
WOULD HAVE A MORE NEGATIVE

02:32:11.589 --> 02:32:14.992
IMPACT FRANKLY ON STUDENTS- WE

02:32:15.059 --> 02:32:17.728
HAVE A NUMBER OF IDEAS HERE I'M

02:32:17.795 --> 02:32:19.063
STRUGGLING WITH HIM ONE BY ONE

02:32:19.129 --> 02:32:20.698
JUST AND- WE'RE ALL BIG. THERE

02:32:20.764 --> 02:32:21.832
IS IT THE MISTRESS OPENNESS.

02:32:21.899 --> 02:32:24.635
THINGS I THINK WE'RE OPEN TO A

02:32:24.702 --> 02:32:25.069
DISCUSSION WITH THE

02:32:25.135 --> 02:32:27.705
LEGISLATURE- WITHIN TE CONTEXT

02:32:27.771 --> 02:32:29.106
OF OUR OVERARCHING FRAMEWORK

02:32:29.173 --> 02:32:31.408
WHICH IS THAT WE ARE NOT-

02:32:31.475 --> 02:32:36.514
TAKING ACTIONS THAT. LEAD TO-

02:32:36.580 --> 02:32:38.282
JUST PUSHING OUT OF THE FISCAL

02:32:38.349 --> 02:32:40.451
SITUATION IN CHIU FUTURE UP

02:32:40.518 --> 02:32:43.187

02:32:43.254 --> 02:32:44.622
MESSAGE THAT IN OUR

02:32:44.688 --> 02:32:47.391

COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE

02:32:54.331 --> 02:32:56.233

02:32:56.300 --> 02:32:57.501
BE REMISS IF WE DIDN'T SAY WE

02:32:57.568 --> 02:32:59.236

THE CAMPUSES UNFORTUNATELY I'M

02:38:45.249 --> 02:38:46.617

02:38:46.683 --> 02:38:48.752
ORANGES I'M NOT SURE WHEN IT.

02:38:48.819 --> 02:38:49.386

02:38:49.453 --> 02:38:51.555
THAT'S NOT QUITE ACCURATE AT IT

02:38:51.622 --> 02:38:52.823
IS A VIçT THOSE TYPE OF

02:38:52.890 --> 02:38:54.758

02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:12.609
STILL NOT TO LOOK FOR POTENTIAL

02:39:12.676 --> 02:39:15.112
THIRTY REDUCTIONS SO YOU WON'T

02:39:15.178 --> 02:39:17.514

02:39:31.361 --> 02:39:33.797
REALLY FOR YOU SEE BUT FOR YOU.

02:39:33.864 --> 02:39:35.999
TO YOU AS A WHOLE JUST KIND OF

02:39:36.066 --> 02:39:37.601
THE COMMENTS ON STUDENT FEES I

02:39:37.668 --> 02:39:38.802
THINK WE NEED TO BE REALISTIC

02:39:38.869 --> 02:39:40.737
THAT. FOR EXAMPLE THE UC WE

02:39:40.804 --> 02:39:42.139
FIND WE'VE BEEN IT THROUGH

02:39:42.205 --> 02:39:44.141
GENERAL FUND SUPPORT STUDENT

02:39:44.207 --> 02:39:49.246
FEE REVENUE AND- NON RESIDENT.

02:39:49.313 --> 02:39:52.115
AND CSU IT'S MAINLY- STUDENT

02:39:52.182 --> 02:39:53.817
FEE SUPPORT AND GENERAL FUND

02:39:53.884 --> 02:39:54.718
SUPPORT AND CELLS YOU KNOW

02:39:54.785 --> 02:39:56.320
THOSE ARE THE TWO OR THREE

02:39:56.386 --> 02:39:59.356
LIKE. THE LEGS OF THE STOOL.

02:39:59.423 --> 02:40:02.059
AND SO. THE MAJORITY OF CSU

02:40:02.125 --> 02:40:02.793
STUDENTS DAHLE PASSED IN PEACE

02:40:02.859 --> 02:40:05.128
ANYWAY. AND SO MAY TIMES WERE

02:40:05.195 --> 02:40:06.964
SUBSIDIZING UPPER MIDDLE CLASS

02:40:07.030 --> 02:40:09.800
FAMILIES- SO THAT'S A POLICY

02:40:09.866 --> 02:40:10.934
CHOICE WE HAVE TO MAKE AND SO

02:40:11.001 --> 02:40:13.303
BY. BY FREEZING IT WE CAN SAY

02:40:13.370 --> 02:40:14.838
OKAY WE YOU KNOW PAT OURSELVES

02:40:14.905 --> 02:40:16.873
ON THE BACK NO INCREASES I GET

02:40:16.940 --> 02:40:18.976
THAT. BUT THAT LIMITS ACCESS

02:40:19.042 --> 02:40:20.444
FOR ENROLLING MORE STUDENTS TO

02:40:20.510 --> 02:40:21.712
CANNELLA HAVING A LITTLE

02:40:21.778 --> 02:40:24.348
BROTHER OR SISTER NEIGHBOR GET

02:40:24.414 --> 02:40:24.948
INTO THIS YES YOU ARE YOU SEE

02:40:25.015 --> 02:40:26.683
SO. I THINK WE NEED TO REALIZE

02:40:26.750 --> 02:40:28.719
THAT AND THERE'S NO I THINK IT

02:40:28.785 --> 02:40:29.753
THREE WHERE THERE IS ALWAYS A

02:40:29.820 --> 02:40:32.456
CAP. ON ON ON FEES WE LOOK AT

02:40:32.522 --> 02:40:35.125
YOUR CABLE BILL YOUR YOUR RENT

02:40:35.192 --> 02:40:36.860
AND SO FORTH HAVING MODERATE

02:40:36.927 --> 02:40:39.262
AND PREDICTABLE INCREASES LET'S

02:40:39.329 --> 02:40:42.366
SET IT. ON AVERAGE WITH THE CPI

02:40:42.432 --> 02:40:43.433
AND SO FORTH IS I THINK NOT

02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:45.602
UNREASONABLE SO. AS NOT OUR

02:40:45.669 --> 02:40:47.537
DECISION IS UP TO THE REGION'S

02:40:47.604 --> 02:40:49.206
IMAGE AND THE AND THE TRUSTEES

02:40:49.272 --> 02:40:51.108
WE CONTROL COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:40:51.174 --> 02:40:52.175
FEES BUT I JUST THINK THAT WE

02:40:52.242 --> 02:40:54.745
NEED TO BE AT THE STATE.

02:40:54.811 --> 02:40:57.614
REALISTIC THAT THE SAVING OF

02:40:57.681 --> 02:41:01.051
INCREASES THE MATTER HOW- IT'S

02:41:01.118 --> 02:41:06.590
THE ARE HAVE. SO WITH THAT I'M

02:41:06.656 --> 02:41:09.626
GOING TO. TURN ME OVER TO MR

02:41:09.693 --> 02:41:12.229
MEDINA FOR A FEW MOMENTS. AND

02:41:12.295 --> 02:41:13.196
WE HAVE A FEW MORE QUESTIONS

02:41:13.263 --> 02:41:15.265
FROM SOMEONE MEMBER LEE MON AND

02:41:15.332 --> 02:41:16.867
IF ANY OTHERS WANT TO ENGAGE

02:41:16.933 --> 02:41:18.101
AND THEN WE'LL GET TO PUBLIC

02:41:18.168 --> 02:41:29.513
COMMENTS THANK YOU. BOB. FIVE

02:41:29.579 --> 02:41:31.348
THIRTY THE PHONES ARE GOING TO

02:41:31.415 --> 02:41:38.321
TURN OFF. SO. BY THE END OF THE

02:41:38.388 --> 02:41:39.456
WE'LL TRY TO SLEEP ON. I

02:41:39.523 --> 02:41:44.461
STARTED ASKING I THINK THAT THE

02:41:44.528 --> 02:41:46.863
INITIAL I WAS FOR BOTH THE

02:41:46.930 --> 02:41:47.931
SECOND AND DEAL AT AND THEN

02:41:47.998 --> 02:41:53.336
HOPING THAT THE SEGMENTS- AND-

02:41:53.403 --> 02:41:56.073
AND FOR THE PEACE. ABOUT WHAT

02:41:56.139 --> 02:41:58.275
THE LOS BEFORE THE IMPACT IS

02:41:58.341 --> 02:42:00.677
GOING TO BE FOR STUDENTS GIVEN

02:42:00.744 --> 02:42:06.016
THE PROPOSED BUDGET. SINCE I'M

02:42:06.083 --> 02:42:07.250
SITTING RIGHT HERE I'LL TAKE

02:42:07.317 --> 02:42:08.652
THE QUESTION THANK YOU

02:42:08.718 --> 02:42:10.821
ASSEMBLYMEMBER LAMONT- WERE

02:42:10.887 --> 02:42:12.722
VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

02:42:12.789 --> 02:42:14.057
QUALITY OF INSTRUCTION FOR

02:42:14.124 --> 02:42:16.693
STUDENTS EXPOSURE LEE AS THE

02:42:16.760 --> 02:42:18.528
COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC CRISIS

02:42:18.595 --> 02:42:20.797
CONTINUES AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW

02:42:20.864 --> 02:42:23.366
MUCH IN FINANCIAL LOSSES THE UC

02:42:23.433 --> 02:42:26.069
SYSTEM WILL HAVE TO BEAR IN OUR

02:42:26.136 --> 02:42:28.705
OTHER AREAS. SO WE'RE VERY WORK

02:42:28.772 --> 02:42:30.173
OUT OF THE QUALITY OF

02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:32.943
INSTRUCTION IF WE CONTINUE TO

02:42:33.009 --> 02:42:34.811
LOSE FUNDING. AT THIS POINT WE

02:42:34.878 --> 02:42:36.613
ARE PUTTING EMPHASIS ON STUDENT

02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:38.748
SAFETY AND THIS IS WHY WE HAVE

02:42:38.815 --> 02:42:40.617
MOVED TO REMOTE INSTRUCTION ON

02:42:40.684 --> 02:42:42.352
ALL OUR CAMPUSES. AND WE ARE

02:42:42.419 --> 02:42:44.488
LOOKING AT HOW TO SAFELY RE

02:42:44.554 --> 02:42:46.857
POPULATE OUR CAMPUSES AND BRING

02:42:46.923 --> 02:42:49.493
STUDENTS BACK FOR THAT UP ON

02:42:49.559 --> 02:42:53.730
CAMPUS EXPERIENCE. I'LL HAND IT

02:42:53.797 --> 02:42:56.032
OVER TO SEE US YOU KNOW UNLESS

02:42:56.099 --> 02:42:56.633
YOU HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION

02:42:56.700 --> 02:42:59.970
FOR ME. I DO SO WHAT DO YOU

02:43:00.036 --> 02:43:03.206
HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT. A

02:43:03.273 --> 02:43:03.773
CHANGING QUALITY COULD LOOK

02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:08.545
LIKE. CHANGING QUALITY COULD BE

02:43:08.612 --> 02:43:12.182
FEWER LECTURERS BEING HIRED-

02:43:12.249 --> 02:43:13.517
FOR FOLLOWING TERMS IT WOULD

02:43:13.583 --> 02:43:17.287
MEAN. LONGER POTENTIAL WAIT

02:43:17.354 --> 02:43:20.524
LIST FOR CERTAIN MAJORS- IT

02:43:20.590 --> 02:43:22.759
COULD MEAN FEWER COURSES GRADE

02:43:22.826 --> 02:43:23.994
MORE BOTTLENECKS AND CAUSING

02:43:24.060 --> 02:43:25.729
STUDENTS TO TAKE LONGER TO

02:43:25.795 --> 02:43:27.697
GRADUATE ONE OF THE THINGS THE

02:43:27.764 --> 02:43:28.932
UC SYSTEM HAS REALLY BEEN

02:43:28.999 --> 02:43:32.235
WORKING ON ITS OF. ELIMINATING

02:43:32.302 --> 02:43:34.571
BOTTLENECKS IN MAJOR SO THAT

02:43:34.638 --> 02:43:36.573
STUDENTS CAN GRADUATE FASTER BY

02:43:36.640 --> 02:43:38.208
HAVING STUDENTS GRADUATE FASTER

02:43:38.275 --> 02:43:40.110
RATHER THAN GRADUATING IN FIVE

02:43:40.177 --> 02:43:41.578
AND A HALF YEARS OF IF WE GET

02:43:41.645 --> 02:43:43.079
THEM TO GRADUATE IN FOUR AND A

02:43:43.146 --> 02:43:45.615
HALF OR FOUR YEARS THEY TAKE ON

02:43:45.682 --> 02:43:48.618
LESS DEBT AND THEY MOVE INTO

02:43:48.685 --> 02:43:49.886
THE WORK FORCE FASTER. SO A

02:43:49.953 --> 02:43:51.821
STUDENT MAY HAVE TO BE ENROLLED

02:43:51.888 --> 02:43:54.791
LONGER IF WE HAVE TO CUT BACK

02:43:54.858 --> 02:43:55.292
ON THE NUMBER OF COURSE

02:43:55.358 --> 02:44:06.469
OFFERINGS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

02:44:06.536 --> 02:44:11.007

DELAY THERE'S A LONG ON RAMP

02:44:12.475 --> 02:44:14.878
HERE FOR THAT TESTIMONY OF ALL

02:44:14.945 --> 02:44:16.513
OF IT SO THAT'S WHY TAKES WELL

02:44:16.580 --> 02:44:18.648
FIRST TO GET GET INVOLVED HERE

02:44:18.715 --> 02:44:20.283
ARE FROM SEASONSPERSPECTIVE I

02:44:20.350 --> 02:44:22.319
THINK- MY COLLEAGUE FROM YOU

02:44:22.385 --> 02:44:24.387
SEE NAILED IT ON THE HEAD TERMS

02:44:24.454 --> 02:44:26.189
OF MOST ISSUES WE DEAL WITH

02:44:26.256 --> 02:44:28.592
WELL I THINK I'D LIKE TO ADD-

02:44:28.658 --> 02:44:31.895
IS A DISTINCTION. BETWEEN WHAT

02:44:31.962 --> 02:44:33.063
WOULD BE THE SHORT TERM IN THE

02:44:33.129 --> 02:44:35.899
LONG TERM I THINK WHAT- IS

02:44:35.966 --> 02:44:37.400
MISTER TANYA FROM UC WAS

02:44:37.467 --> 02:44:38.335
TALKING ABOUT WAS A LITTLE BIT

02:44:38.401 --> 02:44:39.903
LONGER TERM FOR US IT WOULD BE

02:44:39.970 --> 02:44:41.538
MORE OF A- WILL IF WE HAVE

02:44:41.605 --> 02:44:43.306
SUSTAINED. RECURRING ONGOING

02:44:43.373 --> 02:44:44.808
COST YEAR AFTER YEAR THAT WE

02:44:44.874 --> 02:44:45.809
ARE GONNA PROBABLY HALF

02:44:45.875 --> 02:44:47.277
PRESSURES ON A ROLE THAT WE'RE

02:44:47.344 --> 02:44:49.779
GONNA HAVE- DIFFICULT IN TERMS

02:44:49.846 --> 02:44:51.214
OF BEING ABLE HIGHER ALL THE

02:44:51.281 --> 02:44:51.982
FACT THAT THE WE NEED TO SERVE

02:44:52.048 --> 02:44:53.316
ALL OF OUR STUDENTS SO THAT'S A

02:44:53.383 --> 02:44:54.584
LONGER TERM AND SHORT TERM I

02:44:54.651 --> 02:44:56.586
THINK- LIKE I SAID EARLIER I

02:44:56.653 --> 02:44:58.455
THINK WE- ARE. PRETTY WELL

02:44:58.521 --> 02:44:59.489
EQUIPPED TO WHETHER A- VERY

02:44:59.556 --> 02:45:01.992
IMMEDIATE STORE. SO THAT WE ARE

02:45:02.058 --> 02:45:02.826
ABLE TO UTILIZE OUR FEDERAL

02:45:02.892 --> 02:45:05.095
FUNDS ARE RESERVES OTHERS A

02:45:05.161 --> 02:45:06.696
QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT THE

02:45:06.763 --> 02:45:08.431
LEVEL OF RESERVES THAT- YOU SEE

02:45:08.498 --> 02:45:10.267

02:45:19.676 --> 02:45:20.610
THE INSTRUCTION AND THAT IT

02:45:20.677 --> 02:45:24.514

AMOUNT YOU COULD CUT THAT THE

02:45:31.888 --> 02:45:33.957
C. ISSUE THAT WOULD BE THE

02:45:34.024 --> 02:45:35.892
INAPPROPRIATE RESPONSE BECAUSE

02:45:35.959 --> 02:45:37.961
