I'D LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS AND THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF- OUTSTANDING WORK ON THIS BILL IN PARTICULAR IT. TO SOME NUMBER OF THINGS IN THERE THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE IN TERMS OF THE MEMBERS OF THANK YOU- AS MANY OF US EXPERIENCE DURING THE PANDEMIC PARKS AND TRAILS WERE USED EXTENSIVELY BY THE PUBLIC. HOW THE POPULARITY OF TRAIL SHOWS HOW MUCH OF A GROWING DEMAND THERE IS OUT. THERE FOR OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES AND HOW MUCH STRESS TRAILS EXPERIENCED OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. IN FACT ACCORDING TO SURVEYS CONDUCTED BY THE OUTDOOR INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. TRAIL USES THE MOST POPULAR OUT THERE ARE ACTIVITY IN THE NATION- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT CONTAINED TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR. NATURAL SURFACE TRAIL INVESTMENTS TO THE TRAILS AND GREENWAYS PROGRAM. TWENTY SEVEN MILLION MAY SOUND LIKE A LOT OF MONEY. BUT THE GRANT PROGRAM RECEIVED OVER. FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. IN REQUESTED MANY INVESTMENTS WENT UNMET. LAST YEAR'S BUDGET CONTAINING DIGITAL FUNDING SOURCE THROUGH THE STATE. PROGRAM AND FUNDS OF FACILITATE EXPANDED. ACCESS AMONG THOSE LEAST ABLE TO AFFORD- INDOOR EXPERIENCE OUR NATURAL LANDSCAPES. DESPITE THE INVESTMENTS THE BUDGET DID NOT INCLUDE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR TRAILS. SYSTEM FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THIS TYPE OF EXPENDITURE. FALLS WOEFULLY SHORT IN THE STATE. HAS NO LONG TERM FUNDING SOURCE EITHER. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY NINE ADDRESSES THIS NEED BY ESTABLISHING A TRAILS AND GREENWAYS PROGRAM THROUGH THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. AND PROVIDES FUNDING THROUGH A GRANT PROGRAM. HERE WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. IS DOUG HANSON WEST RAILS TO TRAILS CONSERVANCY. AND DEREK DAHLE FLY- WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES. THANK YOU GENTLEMEN FOR BEING HERE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR IT'S DARK. I PREFER THE CAL PARK AND REC SINCE- C. PRS IS THE FIVE THOUSAND STRONG TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTATIVE UP ALL THE LOCAL.

THEY'RE OPEN SPACE PRESERVES SO YOU KNOW TRAILS ARE MOBILITY INFRASTRUCTURE YOUR DESTINATION LINKAGES PUBLIC ACCESS CORRIDORS WITHIN OUR- FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL PARK SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE COUNTLESS PUBLIC HEALTH ECONOMIC SOCIAL WELL BEING BENEFITS TO THE STATE. AND TO DATE CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE A STATE SPONSORED BY THE SOURCE FOR THESE TYPES OF TRAILS- TO THE POINT. THE PRICES REALLY GRATEFUL TO THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE FOR THE APPROPRIATION OF A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR. FOR THE STATEWIDE PARK PROGRAM THAT ADDRESSED PARK PORT COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS ARE ALSO VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WENT FOR OUTDOOR PROGRAMMING OUTDOOR. RECREATION PROGRAMMING IN THE STATE BUT WE'D LIKE TO SEE SOME SORT OF COMMENSURATE- DEDICATION TO FUNDING FOR RECREATION TRAILS WHEN CALIFORNIA PRIDE OR SELF LOVE THE NATURE AND THE OUTDOORS AND WE HAVE A BIG OUTDOOR ETHIC BUT- AND WHAT BETTER WAY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT. STAND THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE ALLOWS US TO TOUCH FEEL. AND SEE THE OUTDOORS IN OUR NATURE. RESPECTFULLY. ASK IN YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB TWENTY ONE OH NINE- WILL PROHIBIT YOU SWIMBAIT OR ANIMAL DECOYS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTRACTING OR VIEWING WHITE SHARKS THE WARM WATERS OFF THE COAST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE ATTRACTED AN UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF JUVENILE WHITE SHARKS IN THEIR TERRITORY HAS MOVED SIGNIFICANTLY NORTHWARD. AS THE OCEANS WARM NATURALLY THE PUBLIC IS INTERESTED IN SEEING THESE INCREDIBLE CREATURES OFTEN UP CLOSE AND SOME PEOPLE WHO RUN WHITE SHARK VIEWING TOURS BY BOAT HAVE REQUESTED TO USE ATTRACTANTS FOR CAGE DIVING OPERATIONS UNFORTUNATELY THESE ARE OFTEN IN AREAS WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF BOTH WHITE SHARKS IN THE OCEAN USERS POTENTIALLY PUTTING. A MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AT RISK TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESSFUL VIEWING TOUR OPERATORS MAY ATTEMPT TO USE SOME FORM OF ATTRACTED CHUM BAIT DECOY CENTER TO BRING WHITE SHARKS NEAR THE VESSEL USE OF THESE ATTRACTANTS WHICH ARE FEEDING CUES FOR WHITE SHARKS MADE PRIESTS ARE INTERESTING OTHER THINGS IN THE WATER. SUCH AS SWIMMERS AND SURFERS IN THE PAST FIFTY TWO YEARS THERE'VE. ONLY BEEN TWO HUNDRED AND TWO REPORTED SHARK HUMAN INCIDENTS. AND I'VE JUST WHAT IS NOT AN ATTEMPT TRIED TO INFLAME THE PUBLIC ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE ARE VERY SCARY SHARKS ARE IN THE OCEAN- BUT- WE DON'T WANT TO NUMBER- FLAT TO RISE IN TERMS OF NUMBER OF INCIDENTS AND- WHILE MANY PEOPLE- LOVE TO WATCH SHARK WEEK AND WE DON'T WANT TO COASTAL WATERS CALIFORNIA BECOME JOBS. WITH THAT- I HAVE WITH ME TODAY JENNIFER FEARING- TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU MISS HEARING IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND WE HAVE A QUORUM. OR BEFORE YOU. THE FATHER OF. VERIFICATION HI HERE.

GOOD MORNING MANAGER MEMBERS JENNIFER FEARING I'M PLEASED TESTIFIED TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FISHING GAME WARDENS SUPERVISORS AND MANAGERS ASSOCIATION THE MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM AND OSHANA IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY ONE OH NINE. WHITE SHARKS ALSO CALLED THE GREAT SHARKS ARE THE EARTH'S LARGEST OCEAN PREDATORY FISH THEY REMAIN HOWEVER THE ONE OF THE LEAST UNDERSTOOD OCEAN ANIMALS DESPITE THE ENORMOUS PUBLIC AND SCIENTIFIC INTEREST IN THEM WHITE SHARKS OFF CALIFORNIA ARE PART OF A GENETICALLY DISTINCT NORTHEAST PACIFIC POPULATION SATELLITE TAGGING STUDIES HAVE DOCUMENTED THE SHARKS MIGRATING LONG DISTANCES TO HAWAII MEXICO AND THE FAMOUS WHITE SHARK CAFE WHERE THEY CONGREGATE THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM SHORE. AS TOP PREDATORS WHITE SHARKS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN KEEPING CALIFORNIA'S OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS HEALTHY HELPING CONTROL POPULATIONS OF SEALS AND SEA LIONS AND KEEPING FISH POPULATIONS STRONG BY REMOVING SECOND WEEK INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD'S OCEANS ECOLOGISTS HAVE FOUND THAT HEALTHY SHARK POPULATIONS ARE AN INDICATOR OF OVERALL ECOSYSTEM HEALTH HEALTHY POPULATION OF WHITE SHARKS INSURERS A MORE RESILIENT OCEAN ECOSYSTEM IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WHITE SHARKS ARE PROHIBITED SPECIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT CANNOT BE TARGETED OR KEPT IN FISHERIES BUT THERE IS STILL SOME INCIDENTAL CATCH RECENT POPULATION ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT THE POPULATION IS IN THE PROCESS OF RECOVERING FROM HISTORIC DEPLETION. WHITE SHARKS ARE COMMONLY SEEN AT THE- OCEAN SURFACE AND- WHITE SHARKS ARE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN SHALLOW NEAR SHORE WATERS OFF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT NURSERY AREA FOR YOUNG WHITE SHARKS ESPECIALLY. IN THE SUMMER AND DURING WARM WATER PERIODS THEY ARE INCREASINGLY FOUND IN MONTEREY BAY DUE TO WARMING OCEAN WATERS CAUSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. AND THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA REGION FROM ON YOU IN A WAY LOW POINT TO POINT REYES OUT TO THE FAIRLAWN ISLANDS A PRIME FEEDING GROUND FOR ADULT GREAT WHITES. WITH INCREASED SIGHTINGS COMES INCREASED INTEREST AND THE PUBLIC HAS BECOME MORE AWARE OF THEIR PRESENCE FURTHER INCREASING THE POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN SHARK INTERACTIONS. AND AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STATED SOME INDIVIDUALS RUNNING WHITE SHARK VIEWING TOURS BY BOAT WANT TO USE ATTRACTANTS FOR CAGE DIVING. PLANS IN AREAS WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF BOTH WHITE SHARKS AND OCEAN USERS. PROHIBITING THIS PRACTICE WILL PROTECT BOTH SHARKS AND THE PUBLIC WHILE KEEPING THIS IMPORTANT NATURAL OCEAN PREDATOR WILD WE APPRECIATE YOU MISTER BENNETT FOR CHAMPIONING THIS EFFORT TO PROTECT WHITE SHARKS PUBLIC SAFETY.

I CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO TAKE THIS AMENDMENT JUST RIGHT NOW- BUT IT CERTAINLY WILLING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD- TO SEE IF THERE IS- A- WAY TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS.

SO WE WILL AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY NINE BY MISTER KIRK WHEN YOU'RE READY- THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS. BOB I WOULD LIKE TO THANK COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR THOROUGH THOUGHTFUL ANALYSIS. SHOULD DISPEL MOVE OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE I WILL ACT ON THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION AND CLARIFY THAT GROUNDWATER RECHARGE. RECHARGE PROJECTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THIS BILL. SO I'M TAKING THE- SUGGESTED AMENDMENT CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO CALIFORNIA FOR MANY REASONS. VICE DRINKING WATER TO OVER TWENTY NINE MILLION CALIFORNIANS MILLION ACRES OF FARMLAND AND CRITICAL HABITAT FOR MANY NATIVE SPECIES. THE STATE WATER BOARD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING THE WATER IN THE BAY DELTA. BY DROPPING AND IMPLEMENTING WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVES AS PART OF THE BAY DELTA WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN OR FAIL TO PLAN. THIS PLAN WAS ADOPTED IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE NEARLY TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO. SINCE THEN THE IMPACT OF DROUGHT AND CLIMATE. HAVE BEGUN TO WRECK HAVOC ON THE DELTA. COUPLED WITH OTHER FACTORS THIS IS DRIVEN SOME NATIVE FISH TO THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION EXTINCTION AND PROBABLY TO EXTINCTION. WHEN THE WATER BOARD STARTED THE MOST RECENT UPDATES TO THE BAY DELTA PLAN IN TWO THOUSAND NINE. YOU COULD STILL FIND DELTA SMELT IN THE DELTA. NOW THEY HAVE NOT BEEN SEEN IN THE WILD FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS. REPORTS BY WATER LAW EXPERTS AND THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE FOUND THAT UPDATES THE BAY DELTA PLANNER URGENTLY NEEDED TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S DRINKING WATER. NATIVE FISH AND THE WATERSHED ITSELF FROM WORSENING THREATS IMPOSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND DROUGHT. THE LACK OF MODERN WATER QUALITY STANDARDS ALSO HURTS LONG TERM PLANNING FOR WATER PROJECTS BY CREATING UNCERTAINTY THAT IS IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX NINETEEN NINETY FIVE. YOU COULD HAVE SAID- YOU CAN IMPROVE MY PLOT I REQUEST FOR WATER FROM THE DELTA BECAUSE THERE IS AN ESTABLISHED PLAN THERE REALLY IS THE ESTABLISH PLAN NOW IS JUST TOO LONG AGO. AND YOU CAN'T REALLY QUOTED SO IT IS ACTUALLY HARDER RIGHT NOW TO GET WATER RIGHTS AND IT WOULD BE IF THE PLAN WERE UPDATED. THIS PLAN A CO DEFIES THE CURRENT GOAL OF THE STATE WATER BOARD TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT AN UPDATE TO THE BAY DOWN TO PLANT. BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. FOR A START. AND IT'S TO ADOPT ENABLE UP TO THE BAY DELTA PLAN. AS AN INCENTIVE. THE BILL IN PRINT PAUSES EXTENDING HER A SHE KNEW WATER RIGHTS THAT WOULD DIVERT ADDITIONAL FLOW AWAY FROM THE DELTA. TO THESE WATER RIGHTS PERMITS CAN BE ASSESSED USING CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS. MOVING FORWARD I CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE APOLLO. FROM THE OPPOSITION- UNLESS AMENDED COALITION TO AVOID UNINTENDED IMPACTS TO PROJECTS THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT. IN THE FUTURE I TEND TO MAKE TWO ADDITIONAL CHANGES WHICH STARTED DRESSED CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION THESE CHANGES WILL CLARIFY THAT THE MORATORIUM ON WATER RIGHTS WILL ONLY GO INTO EFFECT IF THE WATER BOARD MRS THE DEADLINE. TO ADOPT THE BAY DELTA PLAN WHICH WAS THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THE BILL BUT WILL CLARIFY THAT THAT'S THE CASE FURTHER OUR MOVE THE MORATORIUM ON EXTENDING CERTAIN WATER RIGHTS TO REDUCE IMPACTS TO WATER TRANSFERS AN EXISTING PROJECTS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR DROUGHT MANAGEMENT. THE POINT IS THOUGH THAT WE NEED SOME SORT OF INCENTIVE. FOR THE BOARD TO CONTINUE THEY'VE ALREADY MISSED MANY DEADLINES BECAUSE THE PLAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN UPDATED AND IT HASN'T AND WE HAVE FELT THE IMPACT. WITH ME TODAY IS JONAS MILTON FROM THE PLANNING THE CONSERVATION LEAD AND RICHARD FRANK FROM THE UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF LAW LET ME ALSO POINT OUT THAT I AM WILLING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO COME UP WITH ALTERNATIVE. INCENTIVES AND- WE WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS WE DID LAST NIGHT WHEN I MADE THESE. THESE CHANGES TO THE BILL WHICH WE WILL TAKE IN THE NEXT COMMITTEE. THANK YOU AND AGAIN AND- WHOSE FIRST. OKAY- MR ROBERTS FRANK FRANK FROM THE UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF LAW THANK YOU DR PARK MANAGER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I AM A PROFESSOR OF AND- OF LAW AT UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF LAW WHERE I TEACH WATER LAUNCH HERBAL NATURAL RESOURCES- COURSES IN ADDITION TO THAT ON THE FORMER CHIEF DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND MOST RELEVANT- IN NINETEEN TWENTY ONE AND EARLIER THIS YEAR I COLLABORATED WITH OTHER WHAT OUR PROFESSORS FROM STANFORD BERKELEY AND MIKE GEORGE. AND OTHER WATER LAW EXPERTS ON A BACKGROUND REPORT AND A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS BY DEFYING TO UPDATE CALIFORNIA'S ANTIQUATED ABOVE WATER RIGHTS LAW SYSTEM AT THE CRYPTIC HE PUT. I'M SORRY. THE STATE YOU GET THAT THANK YOU FOR HI MISSPOKE. MY CHILDREN TELL ME I'M A PRISONER THE PAST THANK YOU THAT RIGHT. TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND- THIS YEAR- ON BACKGROUND REPORT IS A RECOMMENDATIONS THE PENDING BILL IS PART OF OUR ONE OF THE SEVERAL BILLS. PENDING TO INCORPORATE AND ADOPT SOME OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS- AS AS DR CORPORATES INDICATED SPEND OVER A QUARTER CENTURY. SINCE THE NINETEEN NINETY FIVE- BAY DELTA PLAN HAS BEEN UPDATED TWENTY SEVEN YEARS- IN FACT. IN THE MEANTIME IS THE WATER BOARD ITSELF IS LIKE KNOWLEDGE THAT BACK IN- TWENTY EIGHTEEN COULD RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR A QUOTE URGENT EFFORTS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN DELTA ESTUARY. TO ADDRESS PROLONGED A PRECIPITOUS DECLINES. OF NATIVE AKPATA SPECIES AND THE ECOSYSTEM- THEY DEPEND ON. OF THE STATE WATER CODE ALREADY CONTAINS REQUIREMENTS FOR THE WATER QUALITY PLANTS INCLUDING THIS ONE BE UPDATED PERIODICALLY REGULARLY- THE FEDERAL CLEAN WATER ACT UNDER WHICH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HAS DELEGATED AUTHORITY FROM U. S. EPA TO ADOPT WATER QUALITY PLANS REQUIRES THOSE KIND OF RE EVALUATIONS AND UPDATES EVERY THREE YEARS. SO. IS DEFINITELY OUT OF COMPLIANCE THERE STATE WATER BOARDS IS TO. THAT IT AND THE WATER BOARD CAN COME. THE BAY DELTA UPDATE BEFORE THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE- AND- THE- MEANWHILE- THE AS DR CORPORATES MENTIONED AB MY FACULTY COLLEAGUES UC DAVIS PETER MOYLE THE STATE'S. MOST PROMINENT FISHERIES SCIENTIST HAS OUR REPORT CHRONICLED THE DECLINE OF THE DELTA ESTUARY THE EXTINCTION OF SPECIES IN THE FACT THAT UP TO ONE HUNDRED OF DELTA. WITHOUT A DIRECT AND- ROMPED ACTION. IN SOME TO QUOTE OUR WORKING GROUP RIGHT- THE STATE'S FAILURE DURING THE LAST QUARTER CENTURY TO ADOPT AND IMPLEMENT REVISED FOR ST FLOOR JACK IS FOR THE BAY DELTA ESTUARY REPRESENTS A AN UNACCEPTABLE PUBLIC POLICY FAILURE FAILURE FOR THAT REASON BUT- I URGE AN AFFIRMATIVE VOTE THANK YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GOOD MORNING. I'M MINTON SENIOR WATER POLICY. THE PLAN CONCERT LEAGUE BUT PRIOR TO THAT I WAS ACTUALLY WATER PROJECT DEVELOPER. WHO WAS SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING WATER RIGHTS FROM THE STATE BOARD. AFTER TWENTY SEVEN YEARS NOW WHAT'S THE BIG HURRY. THERE ARE TWO REASONS. FIRST THE ICONIC SPECIES WHEN A RUN SPRING RUN SALMON ARE LITERALLY ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION. AND THIS IS NOT LIKE THE MOVIE JURASSIC PARK INTO THE FREEZER FOR PRESERVED SPECIMEN. AND CALL IT BACK INTO LIFE. EXTINCTION IS FOREVER. SECOND OUTDATED STANDARDS MEANS THERE IS NO REGULATORY CERTAINTY FOR WATER PROJECT DEVELOPERS. THIS STATE WATER BOARD IS REQUIRED BY SEVERAL LAWS TO JUDGE THE IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND ON OTHER WATER USERS. WATER DISTRICTS BUT I'M LITERALLY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ASSESSING THOSE IMPACT. BUT WITHOUT CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS THEY HAVE NO REGULATORY CERTAINTY. NOW THIS IS NOT JUST A THEORETICAL PROBLEM. ONE MAJOR SURFACE WATER PROJECT WHAT STUCK IN OVER A YEAR OF HEARINGS AT THE STATE BOARD CHASING THE GHOSTS OF OUTDATED STANDARDS. WITHOUT CONTEMPORARY STANDARDS THEY COULD NOT ASSURED THEIR OWN WATER USERS. THAT THE PROJECT WOULD PROVIDE EVEN A SINGLE DROP OF ADDITIONAL WATER TO THEM MR FOR YOU NEED TO TALK INTO THE MIKE THANK YOU. THEY FINALLY WITHDREW THEIR APPLICATION TO COME BACK ANOTHER YEAR. WITHOUT REGULATORY CERTAINTY THE OTHER SURFACE WATER PROJECTS THAT ARE LINED UP FOR APPROVAL WILL FACE THE SAME HURDLES. THAT'S WHY WE JOIN YOUR LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND ARE FINDING THAT UPDATING WATER QUALITY OBJECTIVES THE BAY DELTA WATERSHED IS LONG OVERDUE AND SHOULD BE A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THE STATE TO COMPLETE. AFTER TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY NINE IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THAT REGULATORY CERTAINTY THANK YOU. CAN KILL ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT HERE IN THE ROOM OR IN THE HALLWAY. SEEING NONE FOR NOW WE CAN GO TO THE PHONE LINES. ANY SUPPORT ON THE PHONE LINES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY NINE YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY NINE YOU MAY PRESS ONE. AND THEN ZERO. NINE THIRTY SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR- CAN DELFINO ON BEHALF OF DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY NINE THANK YOU THANK YOU PLEASE GO AHEAD. NINE SIXTEEN YOU MAY BE ON MUTE PLEASE GO AHEAD YOUR LINE IS OPEN. AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO LINE FORTY TWO ONE FORTY TWO YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU PETER DIRECTOR WITH THE TOLD ME RIVER TRAFFIC IN SUPPORT. AND APPRECIATE THE OFFER. NINE THIRTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. NINE THIRTY YEAH MAYBE IT SO YOUR- DOES HE HAVE TO CALL ON BEHALF OF THE PLANNING CONSERVATION LEAGUE PASS A DIFFICULT FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATION CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY SACRAMENTO RIVER COUNCIL AND CALIFORNIA WATER RESEARCH ALL IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY NINE THANK YOU. WE HAVE NO FURTHER LINES IN Q. IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY SIX THIRTY NINE THANK YOU AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE SOMEONE HERE FROM AUCKLAND TO TESTIFY. IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU CHERUB OUR KEY HUNG IN MEMBERS CINDY TECH WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES WE REPRESENT PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE THEY'RE ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL WE'VE MET TWO TIMES WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK AND WE APPRECIATE HIS TIME IN MEETING WITH US IN THE AMENDMENTS THAT HE HAS AGREED TO MAKE- ONE QUESTION I IN HIS CLOTHES MAYBE IF HE COULD ADDRESS- WE UNDERSTOOD FROM THE MEETING LAST NIGHT THAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT EXCLUDING. THE EXTENSION OF TIME FOR EXISTING PERMITS FROM THE WATER RIGHTS MORATORIUM SO CLEAR IF- CLARIFICATION ON THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL WE STILL BELIEVE THE LINES THAT ARE PROPOSED IN DIVISION A AND B. SHOULD BE AMENDED AS WE SUGGESTED IN OUR MOCK UP ON THE WATER RIGHTS PROVISION- IF IT'S NERO TO NEW WATER RIGHTS PERMITS WE STILL ARE STRONGLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND IF IT'S BROADER TO INCLUDE EXTENSIONS EVEN MORE CONCERNED THE WATER RIGHTS MORATORIUM IS COUNTER PRODUCTIVE HALTING WATER RIGHTS- TAKES AWAY A TOOL THAT THE AGENCIES NEED TO MANAGE WATER AS YOU ALL KNOW MANAGING WATER INCOME. ONE EXAMPLE OF THE CONCERNED ABOUT IS A DELAY SITES RESERVOIR THAT'S A PROJECT THAT IS GOOD FOR SALMON IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY AREA IT'S GOOD FOR PEOPLE IT'S GOOD FOR GROWING CROPS. ON ONE OF THOSE MULTI BENEFIT PROJECTS THAT THE STATE NEEDS. WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT- DELAYING PROJECTS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY THAT WILL HELP COMMUNITIES HAVE SAFE DRINKING WATER A RELIABLE SUPPLY OF SAFE DRINKING WATER. THERE'S UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THE WAY THE BILL IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED AND IS STILL BEING PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED. IN WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THE BILL TO BE WE URGE A NO VOTE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS RYAN OR JACKING WITH THE REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITY- RWA IS TWENTY MEMBERS OF DRINKING WATER SUPPLIERS THAT SUPPLY WATER TO TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN THE GREATER SACRAMENTO AREA. OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IN ACHIEVING OUR MISSION WHICH IS THE RELIABLE DELIVERY- OF HIGH QUALITY AFFORDABLE WATER IS ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH I THINK YOU KNOW IS BEHIND THE REASON WHY MR CORK IS BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD. FOR A LARGE PART ONE LIKE THE COMMITTEE TO BE AWARE OF IS THAT WHILE WE TALK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF OVERALL WATER SUPPLY WHAT REALLY CLIMATE CHANGES IS WREAKING IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE IS A CHANGE IN OUR PRECIPITATION PATTERNS. SO WE'RE MOVING AWAY FROM PRECIPITATION PATTERNS THAT WERE BASED ON SNOW PACKED THAT CHANGES THE WAY THAT OUR SYSTEM FUNCTIONS AND THAT THEN CASCADES INTO RAMIFICATIONS ON WATER RIGHTS AND HOW WATER RIGHTS PLAY OUT AND THAT'S REALLY THE BIG. CONCERN THAT WE HAVE WITH THE BILL. IN OUR REGION OUR PRIMARY WAY OF ADAPTING CALL CAME. SHIP NOPE. REGIME DOWN TO EIGHT WATER REGIME. WE CAN DO THAT IF WE MAKE IT JUST TO OUR WAY RIGHTS AND FRANKLY WHAT IT WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS TAKING THOSE BIG STORM EVENTS SO LIKE WE HAD A BIG STORM EVENT THIS YEAR EVEN THOUGH IT'S GOING TO BE. A DRY YEAR WE HAD BIG STUFF EVENTS OCTOBER AND IN DECEMBER AND WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE STORM OF THE HANDS AND MOVE THOSE INTO THE GROUND NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THE AUTHOR IS LOOKING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. AND I THINK WE'RE MAKING REALLY GOOD PROGRESS BUT WE STILL HAVE A LITTLE WAYS TO GO YET- AGAIN APPRECIATE ALL OF THOSE EFFORT- AND- I THINK I'LL WRAP UP THERE AND JUST SAY YOU KNOW AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE REMAIN IN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION- IS BECAUSE OF THE IMPACTS THAT THE BILL COULD HAVE ON OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND ARM PLANT INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU- ANY OTHER OPPOSITION HERE IN THE ROOM OR OUTSIDE OF THE ROOM. NOT SEEING ANY WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES OPERATE OR ANY OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE LINES.

SLUMBER PARTY LIVE FROM TEL WATER YOU MAY HAVE YOUR- BACK ON MY FORTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. THANK YOU. BUT AGRICULTURE SECTOR AND ONE FORTY EIGHT YOUR LINE IS OPEN GO AHEAD APOLOGIZE I AM NOT CALLING IN SOME SO. OF THE BILL I'M NOT AN AND WE CAN DOORS THANK. THE NEW. WHEN NO FURTHER COMMENTS OFFICE OF THE TWENTY SO THIRTY NINE AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU THEN I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE SURVEY BUT WHAT. SO THE QUESTION THAT WAS BROUGHT UP- JUST MINUTES AGO. IN AS PROPOSAL WATER RIGHTS MORATORIUM WITH A DELAY SITE RESERVE RESERVOIRS AND DELAY WATER PROJECTS IN THE VALLEY. THE QUESTIONS FOR A YES WANTED TO SHOW OUR INTENTION IS- WE'RE FINE WITH SITES WE DO NOT WISH TO INADVERTENTLY- CHANGE THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THE BILL AS WRITTEN DOES BUT WE WILL CHECK TO MAKE SURE- AND WE WILL ALSO BE LISTENING TO WHAT ADEQUATE AND- THE REST OF THE OPPOSITION HAS TO SAY. BOB BUT THE INTENTION IS THAT NONE OF THESE CONSEQUENCES COME INTO AFFECT. THAT'S THE INTENTION BUT THEY HAVE TO BE STRONG ENOUGH THAT THE BOARD STOPS MISSING DEADLINES AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE REQUIRED BY LAW TO UP TO DO DRESSES JERRY UPDATES THEY HAVEN'T DONE THEM SO IT NEEDS A STRONG AND AGAIN I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH ACWA FOR OTHER STRONG THINGS LIKE MAYBE WITHHOLDING SALARIES BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S- LEGAL- BUT- HE COULD DO IT TO US WHEN WE MISSED THE BUDGET BUT I'M NOT SURE YOU COULD DO A PLOY EASE. SO WE NEED TO HAVE SOME TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN THAT THIS REALLY WILL TAKE PLACE MY INTENTION IS THAT NONE OF THESE. EVER GO INTO EFFECT. I JUST I JUST HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL JUST BECAUSE I THINK IT DELAYS PROJECTS IN THE VALLEY. YOU KNOW SO MOVING FORWARD I DON'T WANT TO LATEST PROJECTS WE ACTUALLY WILL PARTY UP PROJECTS BECAUSE THEY'RE VAN B. FOR EXAMPLE THE SACRAMENTO FOLKS SAID THAT WE WANT TO CHANGE WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW. AND BECAUSE OF THE CHANGE IN THE CLIMATE AND YES THERE'S MUCH MORE RAIN RATHER THAN SNOW. IF WE HAVE A STANDARD THAT IS ADOPTED THEN THE REGIONAL WATER BOARD WILL BE ABLE TO SAY AHA WE MEET THE NEW STANDARD YOU CAN IMPROVE OUR PLAN AND POTENTIALLY CAN GO MUCH FASTER SO THAT'S ANOTHER REASON WHY WE WANT THIS TO HAPPEN AND HAPPEN IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT BRING ABOUT ANY OF THE CONSEQUENCES BUT IN FACT BRINGS ABOUT AN AGREEMENT. AT THE END OF THE SITE NEXT YEAR THANK YOU CONFLICT THANK YOU THIS RUN ITS LIKE TO ASK OF THE WITNESSES CHAIR WITH UP AND OF I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE WITNESSES ANSWER THIS QUESTION AND THAT IS THAT. IF IS THERE A TIME WHEN AN ACT OF A LOGICAL ACCOUNTABILITY BILL LIKE WHAT THE DOCTOR CORKAGE THIS PROPOSING HERE- WOULD NOT HAVE SOME. POTENTIAL TO DELAY NOT HAVE SOME POTENTIAL TO HAVE WATER IMPACTS ME MY POINT HERE IS THAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME AND A VERY GOOD CASES MADE THAT. YOU SHOULDN'T JUST ALLOW PEOPLE TO JUST KEEP KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD ON THE PLAN. NO MATTER WHEN WE FINALLY SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH AND WE NEED TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY. AN ARGUMENT COULD BE MADE A YEAR FROM NOW IF WE WERE GONNA DO THAT TWO YEARS FROM NOW THAT ANOTHER PROJECT WOULD BE POTENTIALLY DELAYED AND I SHAPE ONLY POTENTIALLY BUILD DELAYED BECAUSE AS DR CORPORATES OUT OF EVERYBODY DOES WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO. THERE SHOULDN'T BE DELAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DETAILED MANY OF THESE CONSEQUENCES ONLY COME IF THEY DON'T D THAT DON'T DO THAT SUCH AS THAT THAT HYPOTHETICAL. SO IS THERE SOME WINDOW WHEN THE LEGISLATURE COULD FINALLY SAY YOU KNOW FINALLY THERE'S GOING TO BE A CONSEQUENCE FOR NOT DOING WHAT STATE LAW SAYS YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING FOR. A LONG TIME IS THERE IS THERE EVER A WINDOW WHEN WE CAN DO THAT OR WILL THERE ALWAYS BE. THIS POTENTIAL THAT THERE'S GONNA BE SOME DELAY SOME WATER RIGHTS QUESTION EXCEPT FOR. WELL THE REASON WE TOOK AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION IS BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT TIME. AND THEIR NEEDS TO BE AN END DATE. BUT WE SUGGESTED THAT SUBDIVISION AB CHANGE TO HIS SOON AS PRACTICABLE. BECAUSE WERE CONCERNED THAT THE DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST DEADLINE IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. WHICH CAME FROM A STATE WATER BOARD STAFF PRESENTATION I DON'T BELIEVE THE STATE WATER BOARD ITSELF HAS SAID. IN A WHICH PATHWAY WITH A WANNA USE WHICH STATE DO THEY THINK THEY CAN MAKE. SO I THINK THAT'S AN OPEN QUESTION. BUT WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE DEADLINE BEING PROPOSED CUTS THE PUBLIC PROCESS PART YOU KNOW YOU. YOU CAN'T JAM THE PUBLIC PROCESS AT THE END WE NEED TO HAVE COMMITMENT THAT THE PUBLIC AT MY PART PARDON ME FOR HAPPENED JUST NO TIME IS JUST ABOUT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU THINK THE DEADLINE. IS TOO SOON BUT MY QUESTION ONLY IS THERE SOME WINDOW WHERE THERE WOULD NOT BE THESE CONCERNS. SO I THINK IT DEPENDS ON THE PROCESS THAT YOU GET TO THE END POINT RIGHT SO I THINK THAT THE BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING EVEN THOUGH THE BILL'S RELATIVELY SHORT THREE SUBDIVISIONS. IT HIT- COMES INTO A PROCESS THAT HAS BEEN IN PLAY FOR TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AND DISRUPTS WATER RIGHT AND LAW THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE STATE RIGHT SO. IF THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE GET TO THAT AMPULLAE. THAT'S THAT'S THE REAL CHALLENGE RIGHT BECAUSE YOU KNOW AS A FAMILY MEMBER VEHICLE WHO I WAS ASKING ABOUT THE RAMIFICATIONS ON PROJECTS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HAVING THE LEAST RAMIFICATIONS ARE PROJECTS ESPECIALLY THOSE CLIMATE ADAPTATION PROJECTS AND SO. YOUR YOUR QUESTION IS A GREAT QUESTION BUT I THINK IT'S THE CORE OF THE BELT THAT WE REALLY NEED TO WORK THROUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL IS CONSIDERING THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE GET TO THE END POINT. AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THE REAL CHALLENGE BECAUSE WE'RE ACCELERATING A PROCESS WHERE THERE'S A VARIETY OF PATHWAYS. AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE TAKE TIME TO GET THAT PROCESS RIGHT. AND THAT ALL VOICES ARE HEARD IN THAT PROCESS AND THEN WE DON'T DESERVE CITIZENSHIP SO FOR ME THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE A SET. OF WE AN ASSEMBLY WHO IS WILLING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE PROCESS. BUT SHOULD WE BEGIN THE PROCESS OF SAYING HEY ACCOUNTABILITY IS COMING. AND WE- NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO BRING THIS TO AN END. AND SO. TO IDENTIFY THAT WELL WE DON'T WANT TO DATE WE WANT TO SAY AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE. AND COMBINE THAT WITH THE FOR HIS LEGACY BY MOTOR FINANCE. IF I IF I COULD IF IT IS AS IS AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE. JUST ALLOWS SOMEBODY TO KICK THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD BY SAYING WHAT'S NOT PRACTICAL YET BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THE SITES RESERVOIRS NOT PRACTICAL YET BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS- WE HAVE A- I THINK A GOOD FAITH EFFORT BEING MADE TO SAVE. THERE WILL BE AN EFFORT TO WORK WITH YOU ON THE PROCESS AND TO MAKE THAT DISTINCTION- GOOD FAITH EVER TRY TO WORK ON THE PROCESS BUT- AT LEAST. IF WE DON'T BEGIN THE PROCESS NOW OF ACCOUNTABILITY. MY QUESTION IS WHEN DO WE BEGIN THE PROCESS OF ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATURE HAS. JUST ABOUT BEEN FILLED TO THE TOP WITH. CONSTANTLY A SENSE OF THERE IS A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON STATE. MANDATED DUTIES OF VARIOUS AGENCIES THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU MISTER BANNISTER LEVINE YOUR QUESTION. YEAH I THINK OF A FEW. I WANTED CALL UP THE WITNESSES THAT- PROVIDED TEST I THINK SOMEONE GOT A PHONE CALL BUT- THERE IS A MENTION OF- YOU KNOW AN EXTINCTION LEVEL EVENT FOR SMELTS- THAT. YOU KNOW WE MANY OF US. MANY OF US I WAS IN OFFICE FOR- HENDO IS ON THIS COMMITTEE- AS WE SAW THAT THE NUMBERS DWINDLE I CAN'T BELIEVE I AM PEOPLE PERSON ON THIS COMMITTEE- THAT THAT'S HOW TIME FLIES- SO. YOU KNOW THIS IS A TWENTY SEVEN YEAR DELAYED. YOU KNOW PLAN THAT DOCTOR QUIRK IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE- GET THIS THING GOING HOW DO WE- NOT PRESIDE OVER EXTINCTION LEVEL EVENTS. AND I THINK THAT PERHAPS. BY THE TIME WE WERE IN A POLICY MAKING. POSITION AND WE HAVE THE LAST DROUGHT. THAT- THE CARD HAD ALREADY BEEN DEALT- THAT THAT PERHAPS IT WAS TOO LATE TO HAVE THE IN AN INTERVENTION- THAT WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE OUTCOME- SO I WANT TO ASK YOU YOU KNOW. TO LOOK BACK AND SAY WHAT WOULD HAVE THAT WINDOW OF TIME BEEN TO MAYBE NOT THAT THIS ALONE WOULD HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM. BUT WHAT WE'RE WITH THAT WINDOW OF TIME HAVE BEEN AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THAT WHAT IS THE PARALLEL TODAY. THAT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT WE COULD HAVE IMPACTS OF COURSES BILLS MUCH BIGGER THAN THAN ONLY. AND I DON'T WANT TO SAY ONLY EXTINCTION LEVEL EVENTS FOR ANY SPECIES- BECAUSE THAT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE- BUT IF YOU CAN JUST KIND OF PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT. THE DELTA SMELT. ARE NO LONGER FOUND IN THE WILD IN THEIR HABITAT. THERE ARE SOME THAT ARE BEING KEPT IN TANKS. DOWN IN THE DELTA THERE'S A AS YOU RELATED BILL. THAT MIGHT DEAL WITH THAT LATER. JUSTIN OKAY THE BILL LATER TODAY AND YOU CANNOT CHARM FOR THEM- FOR THAT BILL SO. PROBABLY AROUND TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN WERE IN THAT DROUGHT NOW THAT I KEEP IN MIND THAT WAS TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE LAST SUBSTANTIVE UPDATE. IF IT HAD BEEN ADDRESSED AT THAT TIME POSSIBLY THE DELTA SMELT WOULD STILL EXIST. NOW YOUR QUESTION IS WHERE ARE WE ON THE ARC WITH SALMON SPRING RUN IT WENT AROUND SALMON. THEY ARE A THREE YEAR LIFE CYCLE FISH. SO THEY'RE THEY'RE BORN TO GO OUT TO THE OCEAN THEY COME BACK THEY BREED AGAIN THEY DIE THAT'S THEIR LIFE CYCLE AND- WE'RE IN THE THIRD YEAR OF A DROUGHT. THERE MAY BE A FEW LEFT DOWN 23% OUT MY GRADING- WHERE WE'RE AT THAT POINT IF THE STATE BOARD DOESN'T ACT. LIKELY WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TELL YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO TELL YOUR CHILDREN AND GRAND CHILDREN IT DOES SALMON EXIST ANYMORE IT IS THAT CRITICAL ACCORDING TO THE FISHERY BIOLOGIST THAT'S WHAT'S AT STAKE. AND I KNOW I'M GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO HELP AVOID THAT. OKAY AT THE MICROPHONE TO SPEAK TO DO IT. YEAH OKAY- ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU FOR AN EXPLANATION IN THAT PARALLEL I. YOU KNOW I'M I'M I'M I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY- IT IS NOT- YOU KNOW IT'S- YOU KNOW IN IN MY EXPERIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THE TECHNICAL REALITY OF AND DIFFICULTY OF ALL THAT THIS BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO DO AND HOW YOU KNOW IT'S AS ROOF IS IT MAY BE BUT HOW. FAR REACHING AND IMPACTING IT CAN BE THAT OF COURSE THERE'S MORE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND I IN DR CORK IS MENTIONED YOU KNOW WHAT HIS INTENTIONS ARE WHAT HE IS TRYING TO DO- AND- AND I RESPECT THAT. THAT THAT THE EFFORT IN THE POINT OF HIS BILL. I I ALSO HAVE- LOOKING BACK. EIGHT YEARS AGO SEVEN YEARS AGO AT THAT AT THE LAST DROUGHT. AND THINKING THAT THE MOST THAT WE WERE ABLE TO DO WAS PASSED ON A WATER BOND AND DO A GROUND WATER BILL. I AND I FEEL LIKE WE MISSED SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE POLICY MAKING PROCESS WAS JUST SO COMPLETELY GUMMED UP THAT THAT WE DIDN'T. WE DID NOT- ADD TO ADEQUATELY PLAN FOR OR ANTICIPATE THAT THE NEXT DROUGHT WAS GOING TO BE MORE SEVERE WITH COULD BE EVEN WORSE THAN THE LAST WORST DROUGHT WE'VE EVER HAD- AND THAT WE WERE PRIMING OURSELVES TO YET AGAIN JUST YOU KNOW LESS THAN A DECADE LATER DO THE VERY LEAST. WE CAN- FOR- OUR STATE AND FOR PREPARATION FOR- HOW WE ANTICIPATE- WATER TO COME TO PEOPLE THAT THAT THAT WE NEED- THE WATER FOR AND I DO WANT TO- JUST TAKE A MOMENT OF LIBERTY TO. EXPRESS MY APPRECIATE APPRECIATION FOR MR JACKIE AND EXPLANATION OF THE WATER SITUATION WE HAVE I WILL SHARE WITH EVERYONE THAT I WAS THE BENEFICIARY OF THAT WAS DONE I HE WAS MY VERY FIRST LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR- WHEN I FIRST WAS ELECTED IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE- AND I AM DELIGHTED THAT YOU ARE STAYING IN THE WATER WORLD- WITH THE REGIONAL WATER AUTHORITY. AND THAT- EVEN THOUGH YOU OPPOSE THE BILL I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL THE WAY THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO SHARE YOUR INSIGHT AND WISDOM TO HELP EXPLAIN THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN- IT'S SOMETHING THAT I HOPE THAT THIS COMMITTEE AND EVERYONE IS ABLE TO. ENJOY I'M SO THANK YOU MR BACK IN- FOR THAT- SO I YOU KNOW WHAT LET'S CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS WHAT WE'LL PROBABLY SEE SOME AMENDMENTS IN THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS AND SO I THINK THAT FOR THOSE THAT ARE IN OPPOSE. TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT HOW WE DO THIS IS ALL EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT AND I RECOGNIZE FOR EXAMPLE- THE REGION OF THE STATE THAT I REPRESENT WHAT ON ON THE STATE WATER PROJECT- YOU KNOW THEY WERE NOT IMPACTED BY THIS WORLD WE'RE KIND OF LIKE NEUTRAL AND KIND OF HOW WATER IS DEALT WITH. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND YOU KNOW THE ONE THAT'S BEEN. OF BENEFIT TO MY PERSPECTIVE ON THE STATE THAT I CAN KIND OF SEE THIS WITHOUT HAVING- YOU KNOW AS MUCH OF A STAKE SO I CAN KIND OF. FIGURE OUT WHERE THE BENEFITS ARE GOING TO BE IN AND WHERE THAT THAT IMPACTS ARE GOING TO BE- BUT WILL LOOK AT THIS REALLY CLOSELY OBVIOUS I CARE AND I'LL WORK WITH THAT WITH YOU. AS WE REPORT THANK YOU ANOTHER COMMENT YEAH I DO THINK MANAGER. AS AYE AYES AYE LISTENING TO MY COLLEAGUES- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TIMELINE RIGHT AMIN MIKE MY QUESTION IS THAT. THE INCENTIVIZE RIGHT OR IS IT GOING TO CUT CORNERS. AND IS THE PUBLIC COMMENT GET IT GOING TO BE INVOLVED THAT'S IMPORTANT YEAH SO SURE THE PUBLIC IN FACT THERE WILL BE MORE DISCLOSURE. IF THIS IS DONE BY THE WATER BOARD THROUGH REGULATION AS OPPOSED TO VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT RIGHT NOW THERE ARE MANY VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS NO ONE'S QUITE SURE WHAT TENDENCY OF PEOPLE ON THE SAME WATER BASIN. WHO THERE'S A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT WITH ONE OF THE OTHER- SUPPLIERS AND YET THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN IT SO. WHAT THIS WILL DO WILL BRING ALL OF THAT OUT AND MUCH MORE QUICKLY NOW THE OTHER THING TO REMEMBER. IS THAT THE STAFF HAS MADE A PRESENTATION SAYING THAT THEY ARE READY IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE BOARD NOT CONTRADICTED THAT SHOULD THEY DECIDE THAT THEY NEED ANOTHER YEAR. THEN I'M WILLING TO DO IT I THINK IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE BUT I WOULD BE WILLING TO DO IT SO IF AQUA WANTS TO CONVINCE- THE WATER BOARD TO EXTEND THIS. BUT FROM WHAT I KNOW- TALKING TO THE ADMINISTRATION- THEY WANT THIS DONE AND THEY WANT IT DONE. POSTED IN HASTE AGAIN NONE OF THESE THINGS HAVE TO HAPPEN IF. THERE'S BEEN THIRTEEN YEARS OF THIS I THINK THAT'S LONG ENOUGH PARTICULARLY SINCE IT'S NOT A PUBLIC PROCESS RIGHT NOW IN THE SENSE THAT PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S IN THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS SO THIRTEEN YEARS HE'S JUST PLENTY OF TIME. I DO SEE THAT IT SHOULD GO BEYOND THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AS JUST PROVIDE TO HEAR FROM OKAY TO SPEAK TO THE POINT REYES BY THE AUTHOR THE ADMINISTRATION THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE SEEN THE MEDIA RELEASED LAST WEEK ON TUESDAY FROM THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY IN CALLIE PA WHERE THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS- ANNOUNCING AYMAN NUDE EFFORT. ON ALL THESE ISSUES AND THEY WANT TO TAKE AN INTEGRATED APPROACH WHERE YOU'RE NOT JUST LOOKING AT FLOWS YOU'RE LOOKING AT HABITAT YOU'RE DOING ALL THAT WORK TOGETHER AND- WEBER I READ FROM THE MEDIA RELEASES THE GOVERNOR IS YOU KNOW THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR HIM AND FOR HIS ADMINISTRATION AND THEY ARE MOVING FORWARD. THE- MEDIA RELEASE TALKED ABOUT THAT IF- WATER AGENCIES WEREN'T SIGNING ON TO BE A DIFFERENT PROGRAM THAT WOULD ATTACHED TO THEM SO THE MINISTRATION IS MOVING BUT- I THINK IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION THAN WHAT WAS JUST DISCUSSED HERE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WHEN ASKED IF MR BANNON I THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS IS TO DO A DELIVER TO LET DELIVERED A FULL BODY. I HAVE TO- TRY TO RESPOND A LITTLE BIT TO THAT QUESTION AND I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW THE I BRED EARLIER THE ARGUMENT ABOUT TO THERE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TIME FOR PUBLIC INPUT AND THIS IS AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE PROJECTS ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH O PUBLIC INPUT AND SO IT I THINK THAT IT IS LEGITIMATE TO SAY THERE WILL ACTUALLY BE MORE PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY MORE PUBLIC AWARENESS MORE PUBLIC INPUT- IF WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO FOCUS ON A PLAN THAT DOES REQUIRE THAT. SO JUST WANT TO THROW THAT OUT THERE- TO THE TO THE EXTENT THAT IT HELPS AND DID THROW OUT MY OF MY POSITION WHICH WOULD BE ITS SUPPORT OF THE BILL BUT BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY SUPPORT OF JUST CONTINUING TO MOVE THIS FORWARD WE SEE THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN UNTIL A BILL ACTUALLY STARTS TO MOVE. UNTIL BILL STARTS TO MOVE YOU JUST DON'T GET THE COMPROMISES YOU DON'T GET PEOPLE STEPPING FORWARD AND TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEING ADDRESSED WHAT'S WHAT IS GOING TO BE IMPACTS ON ON- WATER RIGHTS WOULD AGAIN BE THE IMPACTS ON DELAYS OF PROJECT. YOU CAN'T EVEN HAVE AN UP FRONT CONVERSATION ABOUT THOSE YOU HAVE A BILL MOVING FORWARD THAT PUTS SOME PRESSURE ON PEOPLE TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING SO THAT'S WHY I RESPECTFULLY JOIN IN WITH THE AUTHORED TROOPS IN TERMS OF SAYING- I HOPE THAT WE WOULD ALLOW THIS BILL TO MOVE FORWARD SO THAT THESE CONVERSATIONS CAN CONTINUE THANK YOU I'LL TAKE THAT AS MY CLOTHES. BUT ACTUALLY. MISS GARCIA IS ASKED TO MAKE A WANT TO THINK DR PARK MY TENURE OF THE HIM WORK I KNOW HE'S ABOUT COM IN BEING THOUGHT AND SO I HAVE EVERY FAITH AND THAT HE WILL I AND MOVE OUT FOR I THINK IT'S AN THAT MOVED THIS BILL THIRTEEN YEAR AS LONG AND I AS THE PUBLIC KEEPS LOOKING AT IS TO BE RESPONSIVE ID'S LEAD LINES ENSURE THAT RESPONSIVENESS WHEN WE GO BACK ON TRACK WITH THE TRANSCEND THIS DROUGHT- IS BAD AND IT'S GETTING WORSE AND WE NEED TO HAVE THE POLITICAL WILL TO DO WHAT WE DIDN'T DO. EIGHT YEARS AGO MY COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT WHEN I WAS HERE FOR THAT DISCUSSION AS WELL AND SO I'M HAPPY TO WORK ON THIS BILL INSISTING CURRENCY OPPOSITION TO FIND COMPROMISE IN THAT MIDDLE GROUND DOT AND- NOT JUST MAKE THIS TO TRY TO MAKE THIS GO AWAY THING THAT'S GOING TO BE A PATH THAT IS NOT SUCCESSFUL. THIS TIME AROUND A LOT OF THIS. THANK YOU MR GARCIA. WE SO I MR QUIRK-SILVA OKAY- AND I WANT TO SEE THAT- I REALLY TO TAKE MY CALL FOR THEIR ROBUST DISCUSSION ON THIS I KNOW MISTER QUIRK THIS GARCIA SAID IS COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THIS BUT I THINK THAT ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ROLES OF THIS LEGISLATURE IS TAKEN OUT OF MY TIME HERE AND I KNOW IT STARTED BEFORE I GOT HERE IS OF OVERSIGHT IS ENSURING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE DEPARTMENTS AND THOSE THAT WE HAVE RESPONSIBILITY OVER DOING THE WORK THEY'VE COMMITTED TO DOING AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ASKING. PLANNING MISTER BENNETT FIND QUESTIONING WAS VERY APT YOU KNOW WHEN DO YOU BELIEVE THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO WHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO DO OVER A DECADE AGO AND THE ANSWER WAS. THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND SO I THINK IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US AS THE LEGISLATURE TO SAY NO TO. THE TIME IS COME FOR YOU TO DO THE WORK YOU'VE COMMITTED TO DOING. AND AS MR CORKER SAID HE'S OPEN TO ALL SORTS OF WAYS TO ENSURE THAT HAPPENS BUT- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION SO THAT WE DO MAKE MORE PROGRESS. IN ENSURING A HEALTHY. ECOSYSTEM FOR. OTH OUR FISH AND WILDLIFE AND A HEALTHY FUTURE FOR CALIFORNIA'S WATER- WHICH IS REALLY IMPERATIVE AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME AS MANY COLLEAGUES HAVE. SAID AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE A MOTION. THANK YOUNG. QUICKLY S. SECTION FEDERAL PLACE. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY AND TOXIC. MATERIALS COMMITTEE FAR QUE HAN NOW BENNETT BENNETT I BIGELOW FRIEDMAN GARCIA GARCIA I KALRA LEVIN LEVINE AYE. RUBIO AYE SALAS SMITH THE VALLAPUDUA. THE APPEAL COULD WHAT NOT VOTING WARD.

PASS OVER HERE AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE BY MISTER BLUE WHEN YOU'RE RIGHT I GOT TO HEAR AN INTERESTING FISCAL. IF INDEED. THANK FOR THAT OF THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SAY EVEN BEFORE THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND RESOLVE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THERE WAS AN ENORMOUS FINANCIAL STRAIN ON MANY SANCTUARY OR RESCUE WILD ANIMAL FACILITIES IN THE STATE IS EXPECTED TO ASSUME-RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CARE AND RELOCATION OF THE FACILITIES ANIMALS THAT'S- GOOD. A TO ADDITIONALLY AS THE FREQUENCY SCOPE AND BREADTH OF WILDFIRES INCREASE THROUGH CALIFORNIA MANY OF THESE FACILITIES HAVE FACED POTENTIAL EMERGENCY EVACUATIONS AND ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL PRESSURES THAT PUT THEM AND THEIR ANIMALS IN JEOPARDY. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY NINETEEN A FACILITY CALLED THE WILDLIFE WAY STATION IN CELLMARK CALIFORNIA- WHICH COULD NOT RECOVER FINANCIALLY FROM THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN CREEK FIRE HAD TO CLOSE RESULTING IN THE STATE INCURRING SIGNIFICANT. STRAINS AND FINANCIAL COSTS FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ANIMALS HAD TO BE CARED FOR AND PLACED THE COST TO THE STATE IN ASSISTING WITH THIS FACILITY CLOSURE WAS ENORMOUS. THE DEPARTMENT HAS SPENT APPROXIMATELY TWO POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN FACILITY MAINTENANCE DAILY CARE OF THE ANIMALS STAFFING PURCHASING OF FOOD. AND WATER. AB TWENTY FIVE TWELVE MAKE SEVERAL CHANGES TO THE FISH AND GAME CODE TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF THESE CLOSURES ON THE DEPARTMENT AND STATE REDUCES REST OF THE PUBLIC NATIVE WILDLIFE AND AGRICULTURE CAUSED BY SOME CAPTIVE WILD ANIMAL SPECIES. AT ALLOWS THE TO MOVE MORE QUICKLY TO ENSURE THAT ANIMALS AT THESE FACILITIES CONTINUE TO RECEIVE APPROPRIATE AND NECESSARY CARE. IT DOES THIS BY MAKING SEVERAL CHANGES TO THE FISH AND GAME CODE THAT WILL GIVE CDFW CLEAR AUTHORITY TO LIMIT OR PROHIBIT ANIMALS AND THEIR USES. GIVE CDFW THE ABILITY TO REMEDY VIOLATIONS AND GETS THE DEPARTMENT FINANCIAL ASSURANCE BY BEING ABLE TO ADJUST EXISTING FEES. ALL OF THE CHANGES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BY PUBLIC PROCESS THROUGH THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION WITH STAKEHOLDER AND PUT. WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE TIME BUT WE'RE TRYING TO WORK OUT THE CONCERNS OF THAT OPPOSITION HALF. AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS BILL IS ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S A SAFETY NET FOR THESE FACILITIES AND THAT THE BURDEN IS NOT SOLELY ON THE STATE.

FACILITIES I'M WE SUPPORT THE AUTHOR'S INTENTION WE DON'T WANT ANYMORE WILDLIFE WEIGH STATIONS EITHER UNFORTUNATELY THE WAY THE BILL IS DRAFTED. IT ENCAPSULATED COVERS A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN THAT. WE HAVE- ABOUT THE BILL WE CIRCULATED A LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE AND TO THE MEMBERS- HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT WILL BE ABLE TO WORK THIS OUT WITH. WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE DEPARTMENT BUT- WILL HAVE TO REGISTER OUR CONCERNS IN CASE WE DO NEED TO OPPOSE THE BILL AT SOME POINT. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ALL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. YES MR LEVINE. YEAH I THINK YOU FOR THE BILL MISTER BLUE I WANT TO JUST. THE ANALYSIS WHICH CALLED OUT THE COST OF THE STATE WHICH I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY WHY ARE WE DOING THIS BILL- YOU KNOW COSTS ARE BEING PUT ON TO US BUT WHAT WAS INTERESTING TO ME- WAS ALSO- THE QUESTION OF. HOW DO WE CARE FOR THESE ANIMALS WHEN THEY COME INTO OUR CUSTODY AND- SO I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE A WITNESS- ON. THE PHONE THAT THAT IS AVAILABLE. DO WE- CARE FOR THEM AND STATE FACILITIES ARE THERE OTHER ISSUES OR PLACES WHERE WE THEN. PUT THEM AND THEN COVER THAT THOSE EXPERT YOU KNOW BOARDING COSTS- I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW THE STATE DOES THAT. THAT'S QUESTION FOR CHRIS GORY YET. MISTER COREY ARE YOU ON THE LINE CANCER THIS LIVING QUESTION. YET YEAH THANK YOU HI KRISTIN GLORY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE- SO IN THIS INSTANCE WHEN THE DEPARTMENT- HAD TO TAKE OVER THE WILDLIFE WAY STATION THE ANIMALS ACTUALLY STAYED ON SITE AND WE BROUGHT IN SUPPORT- TO- MET WITH THE ANIMALS INCLUDING TRUCKING IN WATER BECAUSE THERE WAS NO. WATER ON SITE AND- AS ANIMAL- AS WE FOUND LOCATION TO ROUTE TO EVERY FOUND OPTIONS TO RELOCATE THE ANIMALS WE WITH HAVE TO GO INSPECT THOSE THE STANDARDS BEFORE THE ANIMAL COULD BE TRANSFERRED- BUT THAT PROCESS THAT TIME OVER THE LAST IT'S BEEN ALMOST THREE YEARS THAT THAT'S BEEN GOING ON- ALL OF THE ANIMALS HAVE BEEN RELOCATED TO NEW FACILITIES. IN THE STATE OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA- THERE ARE EIGHTEEN CHIMPANZEES THAT ARE STILL ON SITE WE HOW THE- POTENTIALLY NEW HOME FOR ALL OF THEM- BUT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THAT REVIEW PROCESS RIGHT NOW AND IT'S OUR GOAL THAT BY THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO THEY WILL. BE A THEIR. AND AS A FOLLOW UP- THAT THE STATE HAS NO- ESSENTIALLY NOT NOT SEIZING THAT PROPERTY BUT THAT KIND OF TAKING MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT PROPERTY- AS JUST A BUT TELL ME HOW THAT WORKS. CHRIS. SO THE STATE WELL WE CAME IN- WITH THE OPENNESS OF WILDLIFE WAY STATION IN THEIR EXISTING STAFF AND THEY ALLOW THAT- ON THE PROPERTY EIGHT- THAT WAS BECAUSE OF THAT MUTUAL AGREEMENT- THAT THEY ALLOWED THAT WE ALSO HAVE A MAJORITY OF THEIR- ON STAFF THAT WERE FAMILIAR WITH THE ANIMALS TO HELP WITH THAT THAT'S- A BIT I THINK THAT THAT IS UNIQUE TO THAT SITUATION- AND I'M NOT SURE HOW IT WOULD PLAY OUT IN A DIFFERENT ONE. OKAY THANK YOU. YOU MISTER LEVINE ANY OTHER. OR COMMENTS. OKAY WHEN I KNOW I'M OUT I REALLY APPRECIATE EXACTLY LEVINE POINTED OUT WHICH IS OUR FOCUS ON THE STATE HAVING TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF THESE FACILITIES- NOT PROPERLY CARING FOR BEING ABLE TO CARE FOR THESE ANIMALS- BUT IF YOU WOULD IN YOUR CLOTHES ADDRESS ON THE COMMENTS BY ON THE OPPOSITION REGARDING THE IMPACTS TO THE ECONOMIC ENGINE IN YOUR COMMUNITY. BY WHAT I KNOW IT'S I'M SURE CONSERVE YOURSELF WITH THAT. YOU'RE A THANK YOU ANNA CHAIR THE LAST THING I WANT TO SEE- AS A CO AUTHOR OF EVERY ITERATION OF THE FILM TAX CREDIT. AND- MY OFFICE WORKED VERY HARD TO IMPROVE THE LANGUAGE AND ALL THOSE BILLS- LAST THING I WANT TO SEE IS- OF THE FILM INDUSTRY OR ANY INDUSTRY- OF LEAVE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- SO WE'RE COMMITTED TO. WORKING HARD TO WORK OUT THESE ISSUES- I THINK THEY ARE ALL READ. BUT IT IS GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME THESE ARE THORNY ISSUES WE DO WANT TO PROVIDE. PROTECTION OF FOR THESE ANIMALS- THROUGH THE- DEPARTMENT- THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS AND WE THINK IT'S ONLY RIGHT. THAT- THE- OF FACILITIES.

WHEN NOT VOTING RUBIO RUBIO AYE SALAS SMITH SMITH NO THE APPROVED WHAT THE VALLAPUDUA FIVE WARD. IT DOES NOT CALL THANK YOU. YEAH YEAH. OKAY. HELLO HELLO MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO- THIS IS AB TWENTY SIX TEN. OKAY. GREAT THANK YOU OF SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR WITH FIRST OF ALL WITH REGARD TO THE ANALYSIS I ACCEPT THE FOR COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS LISTED ON PAGE FIVE OF THE ANALYSIS I'M PLATE PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE FORTY FOUR A BILL TO REQUIRE STATE AGENCIES TO IMPLEMENT WILDLIFE CROSSINGS AND IDENTIFIED CONNECTIVITY'S AREAS FOR NEW PROJECTS AND TO ADDRESS EXISTING BARRIERS IDENTIFIED AS PROJECTS HIGHWAYS OR MAJOR BECAUSE OF WILDFIRE DEATH IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEY'RE NOT JUST DANGEROUS AND DEADLY FOR ANIMALS AND A LARGE ANIMAL LIKE A DEER OR A POEM A CROSSING A HIGHWAY CAN ALSO LEAD TO A TERRIBLE. TRAFFIC ACCIDENT AND LEAD TO HUMAN DEATH IN ADDITION WILDLIFE THAT'S ISOLATED IN SOME OF OUR AREAS BECAUSE OF THIS LARGE PIECES OF INFRASTRUCTURE CAN LEAD TO INTERBREEDING ALL KINDS OF HEALTH PROBLEMS FOR THOSE ANIMALS AND A LOT OF STRESSORS- AND NOW IN TERMS OF THE- PROBLEM WITH PUBLIC SAFETY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THERE WERE OVER FORTY FOUR THOUSAND COLLISIONS WITH LARGE WILDLIFE IN OUR HIGHWAYS- AS REPORTED BY CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL ON AVERAGE FIVE PEOPLE ARE KILLED AND OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN CALIFORNIA REPORTED WILDLIFE VEHICLE COLLISIONS EACH EAR. THE ROAD CALLED YOU CENTER AT UC DAVIS IS ESTIMATED THE TOTAL COST OF REPORTED COLLISIONS BETWEEN THIS WILDLIFE AND THIS OF THOSE ARE LARGE ANIMALS LIKE MULE DEER BEARS AND MOUNTAIN LIONS AND VEHICLES TO BE AT LEAST ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN DAMAGE FROM TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY SO THAT'S A BIG CHUNK OF CHANGE- NOT TO MENTION OF COURSE THE HUMAN AND WILDLIFE COST AB TWENTY THREE FORTY FOUR REQUIRES CALTRANS AND DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE TO IDENTIFY AREAS WITH HIGH RATES OF WILDFIRE VEHICLE COLLISIONS OVER TARGETING THIS ON AREAS WHERE IT MAKES THE MOST SENSE. AND TO IMPLEMENT TEN PRIOR PER PER YEAR TO IMPROVE CONNECTIVITY WITH PASSAGE FEATURES LIKE OVERPASSES UNDERPASSES AND DIAGONAL FENCING TO HELP PREVENT THAT THOSE COLLISIONS. BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL FOR TRANSPORTATION FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THIS TYPES OF PROTECTIONS. WILDLIFE CROSSINGS CAN IMPROVE WILDLIFE MOVEMENT WHILE REDUCING WILDLIFE VEHICLE COLLISIONS BY UP 298% WHEN THEY'RE IMPLEMENTED. SO WHAT BETTER PLANNING AND BETTER INFRASTRUCTURE WE CAN PROTECT BOTH PEOPLE AND WILDLIFE IN PROPERTY. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY THREE FORTY FOUR TODAY OR TIFFANY YAP FOR THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY. AND WINSTON VICKERS THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA MOUNTAIN LION PROJECT AT UC DAVIS AS WILDLIFE HEALTH CENTER AND I REQUEST FULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. A STEP ME. IT IS THE DOCTOR VICKERS- EXPERTS THINK GONNA BE. OPERATE DO WE HAVE THE WITNESS ON THE LINE. AND MAY I HAVE YOU STATE THE NAME AGAIN PLEASE- WINSTON BAKER. YES THE LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU AS THE INTRODUCTION SET UP WINSTON VICKERS I'M WILDLIFE RESEARCH VETERINARIAN WITH UC DAVIS WILDLIFE HEALTH CENTER I'M SPEAKING TODAY AS A CITIZEN IS A KNOWLEDGEABLE SCIENTISTS NOT AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE INSTITUTION I'VE STUDIED WHILE AFTER TWENTY YEARS FOR THE SPECIAL FOCUS ON MOUNTAIN LIONS AND HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH A NUMBER OF HIGHWAY CROSSING AND ROAD KILL REDUCTION PROJECT OVER THAT TIME I PERSONALLY RETRIEVE MANY ABOUT LANCE FROM ROW JOHN. AFTER THEY WERE KILLED IN COLLISIONS IT ALSO MAY HAVE BEEN DANGER CAIMANS AND ROAD MORTALITIES OF THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH FOR MEN CHEN OUR STUDY AREA IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN FACT THIS TWO DAYS AGO MY BIOLOGIST PICKED UP A LARGE ADULT MALE WAS KILLED ON THE SIXTY FREEWAY BUT MANY FREEWAYS SUCH A BARRIER THAT PREVENTED EVEN ATTEMPT TO CROSS AND AS A RESULT SOME OUTLINED POPULATION IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE AT RISK OF INBREEDING DEPRESSION AND POSSIBLY AN EXTINCTION VORTEX. WELL I PASSAGE FEATURE ARE NECESSARY TO ALLEVIATE THIS PROBLEM FROM OUTLINES AND OTHER WILDLIFE IN OTHER AREAS AS WELL BUT TO BE EFFECTIVE OTHER CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE KEPT IN MIND IN ORDER TO ENSURE FUNCTION OF ANY CROSSING RESEARCH IS USUALLY NEEDED BEFORE ENGINEERING STARTED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THAT ANSWERS A KEY QUESTIONS FUNDING FOR SUCH RESEARCH OFTEN HAS TO COME SEPARATELY FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES FOLLOWING CROSSING STRUCTURE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION SOMETHING THAT WE'VE CERTAINLY EXPERIENCED WHEN WORKING WITH CROSSING DESIGN. QUESTIONS OFTEN INCLUDE DEFINING THE SPECIES ARE MOST CONCERNED WHETHER TRAVEL INTERSECTS THE HIGHWAY WHETHER POTENTIAL CROSSING LOCATIONS ARE BOUNDED BY CONSERVE LANDS OR WHETHER MORE CONSERVATION OF LAND IS NEEDED DEFINING WHAT TYPE OF STRUCTURES BACK PUT PARTICULARS OF CONCERN FINDING WHAT OTHER MEASURES ARE NEEDED SUCH AS CONTROL TRESPASSED NOISE AND LIGHT REDUCTION AT CENTER AND DEFINING POTENTIAL FUTURE. THREATS TO CROSSING THE CATION INTACT. FINALLY HOW WILL UP ASSESSMENT OF THE TRACK. BY CONDUCT. AND PERHAPS. I'D LIKE TO URGE THE COMMITTEE KEEP ALL THESE DAYS IN MY WHEN CAN. THE ON THIS ISSUE. RELATING TO WILDLIFE AND ROW CROSSINGS THANK MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBERS- MY NAME'S TIFFANY UP SENIOR SCIENTIST AT THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. LET'S CENTERS PLEASE THE SPA THE FAVOR OF THE WHILE PROTECTION ACT. AND WE APPRECIATE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FRIEDMAN KALRA FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA. THIS BILL IS INCREDIBLY TIMELY CALIFORNIA'S RICH BIODIVERSITY IS BEING DECIMATED BY ROADS AND LACK OF WHILE THE CONNECTIVITY. CALTRANS HAS A KNOWLEDGE OF THIS ISSUE. THE F. W. IS READY AND ABLE TO HELP INTEGRATE CONNECTIVITY INTO TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. AND THERE'S A PUBLIC AWAKENING OF THE GREAT BENEFITS OF IMPROVE CONNECTIVITY ON OUR ROADS. ISOLATED PUMA POPULATIONS COULD DISAPPEAR IN OUR LIFETIMES DESERT TORTOISE NUMBERS ARE DWINDLING. NEWTS ARE BEING KILLED BY THE THOUSANDS EVERY YEAR. BIRDS BUTTERFLIES BEAR LIZARDS. ALL OF OUR WILD NEIGHBORS ARE A GREAT RISK. AND SO ARE PEOPLE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN MENTIONED THAT THERE WERE ABOUT FORTY FOUR THOUSAND REPORTED COLLISIONS WITH LARGE MAMMALS. FROM TWENTY SIXTEEN TO TWENTY TWENTY ESTIMATED TO COST CALIFORNIANS MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS. BUT THIS ISN'T EVEN THE FULL PICTURE. THIRTY SUGGEST THE NUMBERS COULD BE THREE TO EIGHT POINT FIVE TIMES HIGHER. PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS REPORT SUCH COLLUSION. OR ADAM SURVIVED COLLISION TO DIE FROM THEIR INJURIES AWAY FROM THE ROAD. FOR EXAMPLE. ONE OF FOR A YOUNG MALE PUMA. WAS KILLED IN A HIT AND RUN ON PCH. N. O. R. NINETY THREE THE ORGAN WILL OF THAT BUDGET AS FAR SOUTH AS VENTURA. WAS FOUND DEAD ON A DIRT TRAIL NEAR I. FIVE AFTER BEING HIT BY A VEHICLE. THESE DOES ARE. SPECIFICS ARE PREVENTABLE. ECOSYSTEM COLLAPSE IS PREVENTABLE. IN AREAS WHERE OTHER STATES HAVE INSTALLED WELL PLANNED WILDLIFE CROSSINGS. VEHICLE WILDLIFE COLLISIONS HAVE BEEN BUTTE HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY UP TO NINETY EIGHT PERCENT. WELL FACILITATING WILDLIFE MOVEMENT. NOW'S THE TIME TO COMMIT AT THE STATE TO BUILD MY LIFE CONNECTED INTO OUR TRANSFER. INFRASTRUCTURE AB TWENTY THREE FORTY FOUR WOULD BE A BIG STEP TOWARDS MAKING BOTH PEOPLE AND WILDLIFE SAFER WE ASKED THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT AND MOVED AB TWENTY THREE FORTY FOUR FORWARD TODAY.

SURE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- THERE IS BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL MONEY THAT'S ALREADY ALLOCATED TO A LOT OF THIS WORK- AND YES SOME OF IT WILL COME FROM CALTRANS THERE'S OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING THROUGH DIFFERENT- VARIOUS TRANSPORTATION FUNDING POTS SOME SOME OF THE FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION MONEY AND THE COST REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT THE PROJECT IS YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE OBVIOUSLY CAN BE EXPENSIVE ALESSO IF IT'S PART OF A PROJECT THAT'S BEING INSTALLED FOR INSTANCE A NEW PROJECT- PART OF UP FOR YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT'S- MAJOR WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE ON A FREEWAY- AND- IT CAN BE MORE MINOR IF IT INVOLVES FENCING A CHANNELING UNDERPASSES TEND TO BE LESS EXPENSIVE THAN OVER PASSES FOR INSTANCE SO IT REALLY. IS A CASE BY CASE- KIND OF A QUESTION BUT AGAIN WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE COST OF THESE ACCIDENTS ARE- YOU SEE THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AS WELL. SO THERE IS NOT A- SO. RIGHT NOW OF. BUT THEY'RE STILL PARTS CONTROL WELL THERE'S NOT ONE SOURCE OF FUNDING JUST FOR THIS. OUR TRANSPORTATION FUNDING COMES FROM VARIOUS POTS THAT ALWAYS PUT TOGETHER FROM LOCAL FUNDING FROM CALTRANS. FEDERAL STATE DEPENDING ON THE PROJECT.

FOR THE PRESIDENT OF NEED A PLANT SPECIES. HOWEVER HE CENTER VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PRACTICES SUPPORTED BY AB TWENTY SIX TEN CAN IMPROVE LONG TERM BY OUR RISK REDUCTION WHILE BOLSTERING NATIVE BIODIVERSITY IN TREATED AREAS. WITH THE ONGOING THREAT OF WILDFIRES ACROSS THE STATE IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE SUPPORT FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS BEYOND THOSE CARRIED OUT BY THE STATE. THIS PROGRAM WITH SUPPORT SMALLER ENTITIES ENSURING OUT FUEL REDUCTION EFFORT TO PROTECT ECOLOGICAL HEALTH AND COMPLEMENT THE FUEL REDUCTION WORK THAT IS ALREADY UNDERWAY AT THE STATE LEVEL.

ARE ACTIVE MEMBERSHIP INCLUDES PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LAND MANAGERS ECOLOGICAL RESEARCHERS AND CONSULTANTS PLANNERS VOLUNTEER STEWARDS AND CONCERNED CITIZENS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. GALATEA IS A CO SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY SIX TEN AND I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION. AB TWENTY SIX TEN. NEW APPROACHES VEGETATION MANAGEMENT FOR FUEL REDUCTION IN CALIFORNIA. AS WE ALL KNOW OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS OUR STATE IT BEEN SUBJECT TO EVERY. WHILE AND THE LOS ANGELES REGION LIKE OTHER REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE IT'S ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH THEIR IMPACT. IN RESPONSE STATE AND ESTABLISHED MOPTI PEOPLE REDUCTION GOAL TO ADDRESS VEGETATION OVERGROWTH AND TO LIMIT WILD WILD LAND FIRE RISK. HOWEVER WITH THE PACE AND SCALE OF WORK NEEDED TO REACH THESE REDUCTION GOALS. FOR HELP AND THEN MANAGEMENT AGENCIES DO NOT NECESSARILY CONSIDER THE LONG TERM ECOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES. BUT TECHNIQUES USED FOR LARGE SCALE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT. COMMONLY USED TECHNIQUES CAN SPREAD INVASIVE PLANT AND DAMAGE NATIVE VEGETATION. THIS ALTERNATELY LEADS TO MORE DENSE VEGETATION AND HEIGHTENED FIRE RISK ALSO INCREASE THE STRAP ON OUR WILDLIFE AND REDUCE OUR CLIMATERESILIENT. ECOLOGICALLY SENSITIVE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM CREATED BY AB TWENTY SIX TEN WILL PROVIDE FUNDING TO A NUMBER OF ENTITIES INCLUDING LAND MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT PARTNER WITH CATALYTIC. TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE. TAKEN TOGETHER THESE PROJECTS WILL REDUCE WILDFIRE RISK OVER THE LONG TERM A LARGE PORTION OF THE LAND AND ECOLOGICALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER THIS SUPPORTS BOTH CALIFORNIA'S FUEL REDUCTION AND BIODIVERSITY GOALS BY LIMITING THE SPREAD OF INVASIVE PLANTS. FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB TWENTY SIX TEN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION.

IF THAT SEEMS FAIR ONLY QUESTION I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU MR PRESIDENT- SO YOU HEARD THE SUPPORT FROM THE SERIES OF HER DISTRICT I'VE ACTUALLY HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WATCHING THE SHADED FUEL BREAK BEING DONE IN MY OWN COMMUNITY ON THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE THAT DEALS WITH INVASIVE SPECIES AND ALSO. PART OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHICH I THINK IS INCREDIBLES PLANTING NATIVE SPECIES TO REPLACE THEM SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR TO REMOVE INVASIVE SPECIES THAT ARE CAUSING. THAT YOU'LL THAT WOULD BE SO RISKY. OUR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE RIGHT THERE ON THE WILD IN URBAN INTERFACES I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT BILL AT MY ONE QUESTION IS. THE BILL IS FOCUSED ON CURRENT FUNDING SOURCES. AND SO. ALTHOUGH I'VE SEEN THAT WORK I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. PRIORITIZING IN A WAY THAT HARMS THE PROTECTION OF COMMUNITIES FROM GETTING THE WILDFIRE WORK THEY NEED CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT. YEAH CERTAINLY- THAT WON'T HAPPEN THIS JUST- WILL TRY TO FOCUS THE WORK ON. DOING IN A WAY THAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE FOR THE PARTICULAR AREA- BECAUSE LIKE YOU SAID. IF YOU DO THIS THE WRONG WAY FOR INSTANCE IF YOU TREAT CHAPARRAL THE SAME WAY YOU WOULD TREAT A FORESTED AREA. THOSE THOSE INVASIVE PLANTS JUST COME ROARING BACK AND CREATE MORE OF A PROBLEM DOWN THE ROAD SO WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY AGENCY. AND EVERY. FIRE CREW. I'M HAS THE SUPERVISION THAT THEY NEED AND YOU KNOW. THAT IT'S REAL THAT THE WORK IS TAILORED FOR THE TYPE OF MATERIAL IN THIS IS YOU KNOW AN ISSUE THAT WAS RAISED BY CHAPARRAL. SOCIETY AND OTHER FOLKS THAT THEY'VE JUST SEEN THESE. END UP BEING COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THE WORK'S DONE IT'S WERE IT'S DONE RIGHT.
