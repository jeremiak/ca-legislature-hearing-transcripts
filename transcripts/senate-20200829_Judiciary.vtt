WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE

00:35:51.849 --> 00:35:53.684
DIETS I JUST WANNA MAKE A FEW

00:35:53.751 --> 00:35:56.053
COMMENTS WE HAD A HEARING LAST

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:59.924
WEEK. ON THIS IT TOOK ABOUT SIX

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:00.725
HOURS. AND CLEAR THE BILL THAT

00:36:00.791 --> 00:36:03.060
WAS PRESENTED TO US THEN. IT

00:36:03.127 --> 00:36:04.729
WAS A MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND

00:36:04.795 --> 00:36:08.132
SUBSTANTIAL IN BROADER BILL.

00:36:08.199 --> 00:36:09.800
BECAUSE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT

00:36:09.867 --> 00:36:11.002
THE PENSION TRUST AFFECT

00:36:11.068 --> 00:36:12.904
TENANTS DOESN'T TRUST AFFECT

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:15.239
LANDLORDS. IT DOESN'T JUST

00:36:15.306 --> 00:36:16.908
AFFECT HOMEOWNERS IT AFFECTS

00:36:16.974 --> 00:36:19.043
THEM ALL TOGETHER. AND WHAT WE

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.978
HAVE BEFORE US TODAY IS CLEARLY

00:36:21.045 --> 00:36:23.047
A VERY WATERED DOWN VERSION OF

00:36:23.114 --> 00:36:25.383
THAT EFFORT I LOOK AT THIS IS A

00:36:25.449 --> 00:36:27.351
THREE LEGGED STOOL YOU CAN'T

00:36:27.418 --> 00:36:29.587
ADDRESS ONE OF THE PROBLEMS

00:36:29.654 --> 00:36:31.155
WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE OTHER

00:36:31.222 --> 00:36:33.057
TWO FACETS OF IT. AND THOSE

00:36:33.124 --> 00:36:35.159
OTHER TWO FACETS ARE NUMBER ONE

00:36:35.226 --> 00:36:37.161
THE TENANTS RIGHT NOW ARE

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:39.463
HURTING BECAUSE OF COLD IT. AND

00:36:39.530 --> 00:36:42.066
HAD WE HAD LEGITIMATE AND

00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:44.702
ROBUST LEADERSHIP ON A NATIONAL

00:36:44.769 --> 00:36:46.771
BASIS I DO NOT BELIEVE WE WOULD

00:36:46.837 --> 00:36:48.839
BE WHERE WE ARE TODAY. BUT THAT

00:36:48.906 --> 00:36:51.309
BEING SAID WE ARE HERE AND WE

00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:52.310
ARE HAVING TO PICK UP THE

00:36:52.376 --> 00:36:54.712
PIECES OF A DISASTROUS FEDERAL

00:36:54.779 --> 00:36:57.048
POLICY ON THIS ISSUE LET'S MAKE

00:36:57.114 --> 00:36:58.616
LET'S LET LET'S LET'S BE HONEST

00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:00.885
ABOUT IT. SO HERE WE ARE PEOPLE

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:02.153
ARRIVE TO WORK PEOPLE ARE

00:37:02.219 --> 00:37:05.990
STRUGGLING. THE A JUDICIAL

00:37:06.057 --> 00:37:09.760
COUNCIL. EXTENDED A MORATORIUM

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:11.329
BUT THAT HAS NOW ENDED IT IS ON

00:37:11.395 --> 00:37:14.165
US IT IS OUR JOB NOW TO STEP

00:37:14.231 --> 00:37:15.933
FORWARD AND PASS LEGISLATION.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.937
AND IDEA- FELT SO STRONGLY

00:37:20.004 --> 00:37:22.039
ABOUT WHAT WE WERE DOING LAST

00:37:22.106 --> 00:37:24.842
WEEK THAT I ACTUALLY- IT BECAME

00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:26.544
A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR THE BILL

00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:28.446
WORKED VERY HARD WITH THE- THE

00:37:28.512 --> 00:37:31.248
AUTHORS- IN HOPES THAT WE COULD

00:37:31.315 --> 00:37:34.652
ADDRESS. THE REALITIES OF THIS

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:36.053
IS A THREE LEGGED STOOL. AND

00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.555
SOME OF THE PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED

00:37:37.622 --> 00:37:39.423
WITH THIS OUR OUR MORTGAGE

00:37:39.490 --> 00:37:41.792
HOLDERS ARE BANKS THEY DO NOT

00:37:41.859 --> 00:37:44.028
WANT TO PARTICIPATE. AND

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:45.863
BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL ISSUES

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.265
FEDERAL PREEMPTION THIS BILL

00:37:48.332 --> 00:37:49.567
DOESN'T REALLY ADDRESS THAT

00:37:49.634 --> 00:37:51.202
THIRD LEG OF THE STOOL IN ANY

00:37:51.268 --> 00:37:54.772
MEANINGFUL WAY. SO HERE WE ARE

00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:56.674
TRYING TO BALANCE A THREE

00:37:56.741 --> 00:37:59.010
LEGGED STOOL ON TO LEX. WE HAVE

00:37:59.076 --> 00:38:00.778
TENANTS WHO ARE ABOUT TO GET

00:38:00.845 --> 00:38:03.414
EVICTED. YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:04.782
HAVE SECURITY IN YOUR HOME YOU

00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:07.485
WERE VERY LITTLE. PEOPLE NEED

00:38:07.551 --> 00:38:09.787
TO BE SECURE IN WHERE THEY LIVE

00:38:09.854 --> 00:38:10.721
FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR

00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:15.226
CHILDREN. AND LANDLORDS

00:38:15.292 --> 00:38:17.328
PARTICULARLY SMALL ONES WHO ARE

00:38:17.395 --> 00:38:19.296
FREQUENTLY OPERATE ON THE BASIS

00:38:19.363 --> 00:38:20.831
OF THE MONEY THAT COMES INTO

00:38:20.898 --> 00:38:22.166
THEM TO PAY RENT SO THEY CAN

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:23.300
PAY THE MORTGAGE AND THE

00:38:23.367 --> 00:38:25.903
UTILITIES AND OTHER EXPENSES

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:28.973
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ALSO NEED

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.242
TO BE ABLE TO PAY THE MORTGAGE.

00:38:31.308 --> 00:38:32.977
SO THEY NEED SOME FORBEARANCE.

00:38:33.044 --> 00:38:35.780
BY THE BANKS. AND THE BANKS ARE

00:38:35.846 --> 00:38:38.449
WILLING TO PLAY BALL IN IT THEY

00:38:38.516 --> 00:38:40.017
ARE IN A VERY LIMITED WAY. AND

00:38:40.084 --> 00:38:42.386
YOU KNOW WHAT. WE'RE ALL IN

00:38:42.453 --> 00:38:44.655
THIS TOGETHER. BY A WAY FOR

00:38:44.722 --> 00:38:46.557
CALLING UPON THE LANDLORDS TO

00:38:46.624 --> 00:38:48.559
FORBEAR. AND TO GET GVE THESE

00:38:48.626 --> 00:38:49.827
TENETS OF BREAKING ASKED

00:38:49.894 --> 00:38:53.531
TENANTS TO PAY. AT LEAST 25%

00:38:53.597 --> 00:38:54.165
THAT SEEMS LIKE A FAIR THING TO

00:38:54.231 --> 00:38:56.667
DO AND DO ALL THE THINGS THAT

00:38:56.734 --> 00:38:57.868
WE'VE DONE TO PROTECT THE SMALL

00:38:57.935 --> 00:39:01.472
LANDLORDS IN TERMS OF THE

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:02.206
TENANT AND TO PROTECT THE

00:39:02.273 --> 00:39:05.009
TENANTS. THAT THE BANKS AND THE

00:39:05.076 --> 00:39:08.112
MORTGAGE HOLDERS ARE TO NOTHING.

00:39:08.179 --> 00:39:09.180
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW

00:39:09.246 --> 00:39:11.916
DISAPPOINTED I AM THAT THEY

00:39:11.982 --> 00:39:13.084
HAVE NOT BEEN WILLING TO STEP

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:16.420
UP- WORKERS HAVE SACRIFICED

00:39:16.487 --> 00:39:18.989
BECAUSE OF THIS- SO MANY NEW.

00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:21.959
LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE

00:39:22.026 --> 00:39:22.560
LITERALLY PUT THEIR LIVES ON

00:39:22.626 --> 00:39:25.296
THE LINE. TO PROVIDE THOSE

00:39:25.362 --> 00:39:26.864
ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS OF OUR

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:29.266
SOCIETY. DURING THIS TIME AND

00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:31.268
HAVE SUFFERED COMMENSURATELY

00:39:31.335 --> 00:39:33.471
WITH FAT AND MANY OF THEM ARE

00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:34.972
THE PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE A

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:38.409
SAVINGS ACCOUNT SO THAT THEY

00:39:38.476 --> 00:39:39.009
CAN RIDE THROUGH THIS AND PAY

00:39:39.076 --> 00:39:41.512
THE RENT. BUT THEY ARE EQUALLY

00:39:41.579 --> 00:39:43.414
IS ENTITLED TO HAVE A PLACE TO

00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:47.485
LIVE AS ANYONE ELSE. NOW YOU

00:39:47.551 --> 00:39:49.153
KNOW WE ARE ASKING LANDLORDS TO

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.021
MAKE SOME SACRIFICES AND WE'VE

00:39:51.088 --> 00:39:53.357
HEARD I'M SURE FOR MANY OF THEM

00:39:53.424 --> 00:39:54.125
WHO HAVEN'T BEEN PAID RENTED

00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:56.060
MANY MONTHS. AND ARE STRUGGLING

00:39:56.127 --> 00:39:59.430
THEMSELVES AND THAT IS TRUE.

00:39:59.497 --> 00:40:01.298
OUR AND TOUGH THEY ARE

00:40:01.365 --> 00:40:02.700
SHOULDERING THEIR SHARE OF THE

00:40:02.767 --> 00:40:04.301
BURDEN AND WE ARE ASKING THEM

00:40:04.368 --> 00:40:08.172
TO DO MORE. WITH THIS BILL. I

00:40:08.239 --> 00:40:10.875
BOUGHT. SOME LANDLORDS HAVE

00:40:10.941 --> 00:40:13.244
FALLEN BEHIND AND OR WILL FALL

00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:15.212
BEHIND WHAT THEY OWE TO THE

00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:18.315
BANKS AND SO THAT'S WHY AB

00:40:18.382 --> 00:40:19.917
FOURTEEN THIRTY SIX- CALLED

00:40:19.984 --> 00:40:21.986
UPON THE BANKS TO DO THEIR FAIR

00:40:22.052 --> 00:40:27.725
SHARE AS WELL. BANKS LIKE JP

00:40:27.792 --> 00:40:29.360
MORGAN CITI BANK BANK OF

00:40:29.426 --> 00:40:30.895
AMERICA WELLS FARGO JUST TO

00:40:30.961 --> 00:40:33.063
NAME A FEW THE VERY BANKS THAT

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:34.598
WE COLLECTIVELY AS TAXPAYERS

00:40:34.665 --> 00:40:36.667
BAILED OUT OF THEIR MASS JUST A

00:40:36.734 --> 00:40:42.139
DECADE AGO. HAVE NOT STEPPED UP.

00:40:42.206 --> 00:40:45.075
NOW AT. TRYING NOT TO GET TOO

00:40:45.142 --> 00:40:47.945
ANGRY ABOUT THIS. BUT THE FACT

00:40:48.012 --> 00:40:50.247
IS WE HAVE PEOPLE IN SUPPORT

00:40:50.314 --> 00:40:51.315
BECAUSE THEY'RE DESPERATE TO

00:40:51.382 --> 00:40:52.383
STAY IN THEIR HOMES WHERE

00:40:52.449 --> 00:40:54.618
PEOPLE IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE

00:40:54.685 --> 00:40:56.654
THIS IS UNFAIR TO THEM AS WELL.

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:58.355
AND YET THIS IS THE BEST WE CAN

00:40:58.422 --> 00:40:59.657
DO IN THIS SITUATION AND I

00:40:59.723 --> 00:41:00.958
APPRECIATE THE EFFORT THAT'S

00:41:01.025 --> 00:41:03.327
BEEN UNDERTAKEN APPRECIATE THE

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:05.896
WORK THAT- THE AUTHORS SHOULD

00:41:05.963 --> 00:41:07.298
HAVE DONE AND THEIR STAFFS IN

00:41:07.364 --> 00:41:10.201
THIS. AND APPRECIATE THE FACT

00:41:10.267 --> 00:41:12.970
THAT. WE HAVE LIMITATIONS

00:41:13.037 --> 00:41:14.705
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE LAWS ARE

00:41:14.772 --> 00:41:17.541
WRITTEN- THIS BILL PASSED SO

00:41:17.608 --> 00:41:19.877
VERY LITTLE OF THE BANKS AND

00:41:19.944 --> 00:41:21.946
THEREFORE PROVIDES SUCH COLD

00:41:22.012 --> 00:41:24.215
COMFORT. TO THE SMALL LANDLORDS

00:41:24.281 --> 00:41:26.250
AND HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE DOING

00:41:26.317 --> 00:41:28.919
THEIR PART AND LET'S BE HONEST

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:31.121
EXTENSION OF THE HOMEOWNERS

00:41:31.188 --> 00:41:32.089
BILL OF RIGHTS CONTAINED IN

00:41:32.156 --> 00:41:34.058
THIS BILL WAS ALREADY MOVING

00:41:34.124 --> 00:41:36.026
THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE ON

00:41:36.093 --> 00:41:38.229
CONSENT. AND THEN THE SO CALLED

00:41:38.295 --> 00:41:39.964
FORBEARANCE PIECE OF THIS BILL

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:42.566
WAS WRITTEN BY THE BANKS. FOR

00:41:42.633 --> 00:41:46.070
BY THEM AND FOR THEM. IT OFFERS

00:41:46.136 --> 00:41:47.404
NOTHING OF SUBSTANCE TO

00:41:47.471 --> 00:41:51.442
BORROWERS. THERE IS NO THIRD

00:41:51.508 --> 00:41:54.011
LEG ON THE STOOL IT ALLOWS

00:41:54.078 --> 00:41:55.546
BANKS TO DENY DISTRESSED

00:41:55.613 --> 00:41:57.214
BORROWERS FORBEARANCE FOR ANY

00:41:57.281 --> 00:41:59.683
REASON WHATSOEVER WITH NEARLY

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:03.020
ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY. EVEN THE

00:42:03.087 --> 00:42:04.121
CREDIT UNIONS AND SMALL

00:42:04.188 --> 00:42:05.522
COMMUNITY LENDERS WHO

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:07.925
JUSTIFIABLY SOUGHT AN EXEMPTION

00:42:07.992 --> 00:42:09.026
FROM THE MORE ONEROUS

00:42:09.093 --> 00:42:12.263
REQUIREMENTS OF AB AT FOURTEEN

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:13.931
THIRTY SIX ARGUABLY. ARE

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:15.266
PERFECTLY CONTENT TO BE A PART

00:42:15.332 --> 00:42:17.534
OF THIS BILL BECAUSE IT ASKED

00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:22.740
NEXT TO NOTHING OF THEM AS WELL.

00:42:22.806 --> 00:42:24.475
SEVERAL OF OUR SISTER STATES

00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:26.377
HOWEVER OREGON NEW YORK

00:42:26.443 --> 00:42:27.978
MASSACHUSETTS HAVE PASSED SOME

00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:29.346
KIND OF MORATORIUM ON

00:42:29.413 --> 00:42:32.149
FORECLOSURE. CALIFORNIA SHOULD

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:34.084
HAVE AT LEAST OR AT LEAST

00:42:34.151 --> 00:42:36.253
REFUSE TO GIVE BANKS READY

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.022
ACCESS TO THE BENEFITS OF OUR

00:42:38.088 --> 00:42:39.590
NON JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:41.959
PROCESS IF THEY REFUSE TO OFFER

00:42:42.026 --> 00:42:45.629
OUR BORROWERS FORBEARANCE. SO

00:42:45.696 --> 00:42:48.032
LET ME LET ME ADD FOR CLARITY I

00:42:48.098 --> 00:42:51.135
DO NOT BLAME. ANYONE ANY OF OUR

00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:53.637
AUTHORS HERE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:42:53.704 --> 00:42:55.072
CHIU FOUGHT HARD FORD ASSEMBLY

00:42:55.139 --> 00:42:56.840
MEMBER LIMON OF COURSE HAD

00:42:56.907 --> 00:42:58.876
FOUGHT HARD TO REQUIRE THE

00:42:58.943 --> 00:42:59.977
BANKS TO TAKE SOME

00:43:00.044 --> 00:43:02.379
RESPONSIBILITY. WHAT ARE THE

00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:05.683
BANKS. THE BANKS HAVE A LOT OF

00:43:05.749 --> 00:43:09.954
POWER THE BANKS SEEM TO BE

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.989
HISTORICALLY ABLE TO GET AWAY

00:43:12.056 --> 00:43:14.291
WITH DOING JUST ABOUT ANYTHING

00:43:14.358 --> 00:43:16.293
TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE PEOPLE

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:18.862
OF THE STATE. AND ARGUABLY OF

00:43:18.929 --> 00:43:21.298
THIS NATION AND YET WE JUST WE

00:43:21.365 --> 00:43:22.967
JUST TAXPAYERS CONSISTENTLY A

00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:27.938
BAIL THEM OUT. SO WE'RE KIND OF

00:43:28.005 --> 00:43:28.872
LEFT IT WITH A HOBSON'S CHOICE

00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:30.908
I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL

00:43:30.975 --> 00:43:32.576
TODAY BECAUSE OTHERWISE IN A

00:43:32.643 --> 00:43:34.478
FEW DAYS PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE

00:43:34.545 --> 00:43:37.214
OUT ON THE STREET. NOT BECAUSE

00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:38.349
I KNOW JUST JUST REALLY WANT TO

00:43:38.415 --> 00:43:41.285
DO THAT. BUT MANY OF THEM HAVE

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:43.287
NO CHOICE EITHER. AND SO THE

00:43:43.354 --> 00:43:45.089
BURDEN OR THE RESPONSIBILITY I

00:43:45.155 --> 00:43:47.858
SHOULD SAY. TO MAKE THIS WORK

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:50.894
FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA LARGE

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:51.495
WITH THE BANKS WERE WILLING TO

00:43:51.562 --> 00:43:54.164
DO NOTHING. AND I APPRECIATE

00:43:54.231 --> 00:43:55.866
THE FACT THAT BACK NEXT THAT

00:43:55.933 --> 00:43:58.002
NEXT YEAR IN JANUARY WE'RE

00:43:58.068 --> 00:44:00.037
RUNNING OUT OF TIME CLEARLY

00:44:00.104 --> 00:44:03.107
HERE. I WON'T BE HERE BUT I

00:44:03.173 --> 00:44:05.342
KNOW MANY OF YOU WILL AND I

00:44:05.409 --> 00:44:07.511
HOPE THAT YOU TAKE UP THIS THIS

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:11.849
MANTLE THAT YOU FIGHT HARD TO

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:12.750
MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE. DOES

00:44:12.816 --> 00:44:15.285
THEIR FAIR SHARE SURE HERE AND

00:44:15.352 --> 00:44:17.488
JOB THAT WE AT THAT POINT IN

00:44:17.554 --> 00:44:19.690
TIME- WILL HAVE TO CONFRONT

00:44:19.757 --> 00:44:20.858
THIS ISSUE BECAUSE AS YOU SAY

00:44:20.924 --> 00:44:22.292
THIS GOES ONLY THROUGH THE END

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:24.928
OF JANUARY AND THEN THEY'LL BE

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:26.930
MORE PAIN. AND MORE

00:44:26.997 --> 00:44:29.933
HOMELESSNESS AND MORE ANGST AND

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.803
MORE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. FOR

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:33.537
THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE FOR

00:44:33.604 --> 00:44:36.173
THEIR CHILDREN AS A GROUP AND

00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:38.709
SAY TRY TO FIND A WAY TO PAY

00:44:38.776 --> 00:44:40.277
THE RENT THE BACKGROUND THAT

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:41.645
THEY ALSO. HAD TO PAY THE OTHER

00:44:41.712 --> 00:44:43.414
EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH LIVING

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.716
THROUGH THIS DISASTROUS

00:44:45.783 --> 00:44:47.551
PANDEMIC THE DIDN'T HAVE TO BE.

00:44:47.618 --> 00:44:50.120
SO I HOPE THAT TO THE NEXT YEAR

00:44:50.187 --> 00:44:51.321
YOU WILL REMEMBER THIS BILL

00:44:51.388 --> 00:44:53.357
REMEMBER WHO STEPPED UP TO DO

00:44:53.424 --> 00:44:56.760
THEIR PART. AND WHO DID NOT AND

00:44:56.827 --> 00:44:59.229
THEN FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES LET US

00:44:59.296 --> 00:45:01.532
NOT LET THE BANKS GET AWAY WITH

00:45:01.598 --> 00:45:06.203
THIS AGAIN. AND WITHOUT BOB I

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:09.373
NOTED TO SENATOR BORCHERS YOU

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.541
HAVE YOUR HAND UP PHOTO BY

00:45:10.607 --> 00:45:14.344
SENATOR MONNING. AND SENATOR US

00:45:14.411 --> 00:45:17.514
SENATOR BOARD JUST GOOD

00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:21.618
AFTERNOON SIR THANK YOU MANAGER.

00:45:21.685 --> 00:45:22.519
THIS IS CERTAINLY A DIFFERENT

00:45:22.586 --> 00:45:24.488
FORMAT- THERE WHAT WE WENT

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:26.223
THROUGH DURING THAT SIX HOUR

00:45:26.290 --> 00:45:30.194
ORDEAL LAST WEEK- THERE I THINK

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.963
THEY HAVE BEEN SOME.

00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:34.731
RECOGNIZABLE IMPROVEMENTS. AS I

00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:36.100
WENT THROUGH THIS ONE OF THE

00:45:36.166 --> 00:45:38.168
CHALLENGES THAT I'VE HAD IS I

00:45:38.235 --> 00:45:39.503
JUST GOT THIS PROBABLY JUST

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.839
LIKE THE REST OF YOU I JUST GOT

00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:44.541
THE BILL I JUST GOT THE ROUGH

00:45:44.608 --> 00:45:47.044
OVERVIEW AND SOME OF THE

00:45:47.111 --> 00:45:49.680
ANALYSIS SO LITERALLY. I DON'T

00:45:49.746 --> 00:45:52.349
HAVE A LOT TO GO ON. AND THAT

00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:54.618
MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE AS A

00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:55.486
MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE

00:45:55.552 --> 00:45:57.988
BECAUSE PEOPLE RELY ON US BEING

00:45:58.055 --> 00:46:00.457
FULLY BRIEFED AND AWARE OF THE

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:02.159
MOST IMPORTANT PROVISIONS IN A

00:46:02.226 --> 00:46:04.428
PIECE OF LEGISLATION. SO BUT

00:46:04.495 --> 00:46:06.296
LET ME MENTION A COUPLE THINGS

00:46:06.363 --> 00:46:08.298
I THINK ARE IMPROVEMENTS ONE I

00:46:08.365 --> 00:46:11.301
THINK THE PENALTY OF PERJURY

00:46:11.368 --> 00:46:12.302
THAT WAS SOMETHING I ADVOCATED

00:46:12.369 --> 00:46:15.205
FOR. LAST WEEK- WITH THE

00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:17.674
INITIAL DRAFT IT HAD DID NOT.

00:46:17.741 --> 00:46:18.642
PROVIDE THAT LEVEL OF

00:46:18.709 --> 00:46:21.612
PROTECTION- THE SHORTENED

00:46:21.678 --> 00:46:23.914
TIMELINE I THINK IS BETTER

00:46:23.981 --> 00:46:26.316
JANUARY TWENTY ONE AS OPPOSED

00:46:26.383 --> 00:46:28.418
TO WHAT WAS BEFORE THE TWENTY

00:46:28.485 --> 00:46:32.322
FIVE PERCENT. OF RENTS- I THINK

00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:35.792
IS CERTAINLY HELPFUL. STANDS UP

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:37.361
MAKING CERTAIN THAT THE

00:46:37.427 --> 00:46:39.163
EXISTING LANDLORD TENANT

00:46:39.229 --> 00:46:42.032
RIGHTS- THAT WOULD NORMALLY

00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:45.469
ALLOW A LANDLORD TO REVIEW. HOW

00:46:45.536 --> 00:46:47.871
WELL AS A- A RENTER'S

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:50.774
PERFORMING IN THE COMPLEX IN

00:46:50.841 --> 00:46:52.509
OTHER BREAKING IN THE OTHER

00:46:52.576 --> 00:46:54.411
UNRELATED TO COPE AND FINANCIAL

00:46:54.478 --> 00:46:57.181
ISSUES RULES STILL GIVES THEM

00:46:57.247 --> 00:46:59.516
AND ALLOWS THEM THE POWER TO-

00:46:59.583 --> 00:47:02.419
MOVE ON INTERDICTION AS

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:04.621
APPROPRIATE. ALBOM'S THAT I SEE

00:47:04.688 --> 00:47:08.358
RIGHT NOW IT IS. ONE I THINK

00:47:08.425 --> 00:47:09.726
CALIFORNIA'S STILL IT CANNOT

00:47:09.793 --> 00:47:13.497
DICTATE TO THE BANKS. WHAT THEY

00:47:13.564 --> 00:47:16.533
EXPECT THE BANKS TO PERFORM AND

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.535
I THINK THE CHAIRWOMAN WENT

00:47:18.602 --> 00:47:22.272
INTO SOME DETAIL ON- HOW THE

00:47:22.339 --> 00:47:23.774
BANKS ARE NOT UNDER ANY TYPE OF

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:27.444
OBLIGATION CURRENTLY AND I'M

00:47:27.511 --> 00:47:29.479
REPRESENTS ELEVEN COUNTIES ALL

00:47:29.546 --> 00:47:31.615
OR PARTS OF ELEVEN COUNTIES AND

00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:33.684
WIENER REPRESENT A LOT OF

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:37.120
FOLKS. WHO HAVE SMALL FOR AN

00:47:37.187 --> 00:47:38.622
UNDER UNIT COMPLEXES THEY'RE

00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:40.190
GETTING HIT JUST LIKE THE

00:47:40.257 --> 00:47:41.024
RANGERS ARE GETTING IT THEY'RE

00:47:41.091 --> 00:47:43.694
GETTING AT SO THIS REALLY IS A

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:46.763
BALANCING ACT. AND I THINK ONE

00:47:46.830 --> 00:47:48.865
THING THAT IS TERRIBLY

00:47:48.932 --> 00:47:52.569
DISCONCERTING IS WE HAVE NOT

00:47:52.636 --> 00:47:54.838
DEVISED. THROUGH NEGOTIATION OF

00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:57.741
WAR THROUGH LEGISLATION AWAY

00:47:57.808 --> 00:47:59.910
THAT CALIFORNIA STEPS UP. AND

00:47:59.977 --> 00:48:02.946
OFFERS SOME SUPPORT TO THE

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:05.515
BORROWER THE OWNER OF THE

00:48:05.582 --> 00:48:08.585
COMPLEX- FOR EXAMPLE WHY ISN'T

00:48:08.652 --> 00:48:10.988
THERE A STATE TAX CREDIT THAT

00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:13.056
WAS PART OF THIS THAT WOULD

00:48:13.123 --> 00:48:14.992
SOFTEN THE BLOW TO FOLKS THAT

00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:17.995
ARE WITHOUT. RECEIVING RENTS

00:48:18.061 --> 00:48:21.098
WHY IS THERE NOT A STATE FUNDS

00:48:21.164 --> 00:48:23.333
ARE CREATED THAT COULD BE OF

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:26.536
ASSISTANCE NOT UNLIKE THE ONES

00:48:26.603 --> 00:48:27.104
THAT WE HAVE AT THE FEDERAL

00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:32.576
LEVEL. SO. BY ALLOWING THIS TO

00:48:32.643 --> 00:48:35.445
MOVE FORWARD. WE'RE GOING TO BE

00:48:35.512 --> 00:48:37.648
HELPING BUT ALSO HURTING THE

00:48:37.714 --> 00:48:40.817
INDUSTRY I THINK LONG TERM ONE

00:48:40.884 --> 00:48:41.652
OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS

00:48:41.718 --> 00:48:44.321
OF IT SHOULD BE OF CONCERN IS

00:48:44.388 --> 00:48:45.889
WHAT IS THIS GOING TO DO TO

00:48:45.956 --> 00:48:48.125
LIQUIDITY AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL

00:48:48.191 --> 00:48:50.160
MOVING FORWARD. BECAUSE THE

00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:54.564
BORROWERS. IT WAS A RISK THEN

00:48:54.631 --> 00:48:56.833
LENDERS ARE GOING TO PROBABLY

00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:59.870
STEP IN THE CRITERIA THAT WOULD

00:48:59.936 --> 00:49:01.972
ALLOW THEM ACCESS TO CAPITAL SO

00:49:02.039 --> 00:49:04.574
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING-

00:49:04.641 --> 00:49:06.443
THE VOLUME OF HOMES THAT WE

00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:07.878
HAVE TO DEAL WITH OUR HOUSING

00:49:07.944 --> 00:49:10.247
CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE

00:49:10.314 --> 00:49:12.949
SATISFYING A SHORT TERM PROBLEM

00:49:13.016 --> 00:49:14.418
BUT POTENTIALLY CREATING AN

00:49:14.484 --> 00:49:16.186
INTERMEDIATE AND LONG TERM

00:49:16.253 --> 00:49:18.255
LIQUIDITY AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL

00:49:18.322 --> 00:49:20.724
PROBLEM. I DON'T THINK I'M

00:49:20.791 --> 00:49:21.491
STATING THINGS THAT PEOPLE

00:49:21.558 --> 00:49:24.428
HAVE. NOT WRESTLED WITH BECAUSE

00:49:24.494 --> 00:49:26.330
THIS IS AN IMPERFECT SITUATION

00:49:26.396 --> 00:49:30.667
AND IT'S- UNDER THE GUN- WE

00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:32.235
ONLY HAVE A DAY AND A HALF OR

00:49:32.302 --> 00:49:33.970
OR ROUGHLY TWO DAYS LEFT IN THE

00:49:34.037 --> 00:49:36.640
LEGISLATURE. THE PROTECTIONS

00:49:36.707 --> 00:49:38.208
THAT WERE IN PLACE ARE SET TO

00:49:38.275 --> 00:49:39.042
EXPIRE SO WE DON'T DO

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:41.845
SOMETHING. THAT BAD THINGS WILL

00:49:41.912 --> 00:49:43.814
ALMOST CERTAINLY HAPPEN. BUT

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.716
MANAGER I'D LIKE TO IF I MAY

00:49:45.782 --> 00:49:47.951
OPPOSE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS

00:49:48.018 --> 00:49:48.552
AND I DON'T KNOW TO WHOM THEY

00:49:48.618 --> 00:49:52.122
SHOULD BE. ARE DIRECTED. MAYBE

00:49:52.189 --> 00:49:55.859
TO- THE FLOOR MANAGER OF FOR

00:49:55.926 --> 00:49:59.029
THIS BILL. MR CENTER BORCHERS

00:49:59.096 --> 00:50:00.997
SHE'S ALSO A I THINK ONE OF THE

00:50:01.064 --> 00:50:02.399
AUTHORS OF THE BILL SO I'M SURE

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:04.501
SHE'S MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER

00:50:04.568 --> 00:50:05.535
ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE

00:50:05.602 --> 00:50:08.205
AND SHE IS INDEED THE PERSON TO

00:50:08.271 --> 00:50:10.006
THE DIRECTOR QUESTIONS TO. ALL

00:50:10.073 --> 00:50:15.946
RIGHT. SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS.

00:50:16.012 --> 00:50:18.081
GIVEN THAT WE HAVE STRONG AND

00:50:18.148 --> 00:50:21.385
PRIVATE CONTRACT RIGHTS. YOUR

00:50:21.451 --> 00:50:25.455
OF OUR AMERICAN- SYSTEM. CAN

00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:28.592
YOU IMAGINE A SCENARIO WHERE A

00:50:28.658 --> 00:50:31.862
PARTY LET'S SEE A RENTER AND A

00:50:31.928 --> 00:50:34.398
LANDLORD LET'S ASSUME THAT

00:50:34.464 --> 00:50:35.298
THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST NOW GOING

00:50:35.365 --> 00:50:38.835
INTO. A RENTAL AGREEMENT THAT

00:50:38.902 --> 00:50:42.038
THEY CAN CONTRACT AROUND THIS

00:50:42.105 --> 00:50:44.141
PIECE OF LEGISLATION ALMOST AS

00:50:44.207 --> 00:50:46.777
IF YOU'RE STE YOU'RE WAVING

00:50:46.843 --> 00:50:48.378
LEGAL RIGHTS AS YOU WOULD IN

00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:50.046
ANY OTHER TYPE OF CONTRACTUAL

00:50:50.113 --> 00:50:53.583
ON NEGOTIATION IS THAT POSSIBLE

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:55.218
SENATOR A COUPLE HERE- WOULD

00:50:55.285 --> 00:50:56.620
YOU LIKE TO RESPOND AS A LAWYER

00:50:56.686 --> 00:50:58.722
I'M SURE YOU KNOW WHAT THE

00:50:58.789 --> 00:51:00.457
ANSWERS TO THAT QUESTION HAPPY

00:51:00.524 --> 00:51:04.027
TO DO IT- LET ME JUST SAY THAT-

00:51:04.094 --> 00:51:06.329
WE DO LIVE IN A IN A IN A

00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:10.901
SOCIETY THAT BELIEVES. VERY

00:51:10.967 --> 00:51:13.170
STRONGLY IN. IN CONTRACTS AND

00:51:13.236 --> 00:51:14.504
UPLOADING THOSE CONTRACTS BUT

00:51:14.571 --> 00:51:16.940
BY THE SAME TOKEN- THE STATE

00:51:17.007 --> 00:51:19.042
LEGISLATURE HAS THE AUTHORITY

00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:20.844
TO MAKE CHANGES TO STATE LAW

00:51:20.911 --> 00:51:23.280
THAT- THAT ARE IN THE PUBLIC

00:51:23.346 --> 00:51:25.115
INTEREST IN IN THIS INSTANCE

00:51:25.182 --> 00:51:27.784
WHAT WE CONTROL IS HOW YOU CAN

00:51:27.851 --> 00:51:29.886
GET SOMEBODY OR HOW YOU CAN USE

00:51:29.953 --> 00:51:31.488
THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE.

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:34.524
WHICH IS THE SHERIFF TO BE ABLE

00:51:34.591 --> 00:51:36.460
TO- EVICT SOMEBODY IT TO THE

00:51:36.526 --> 00:51:38.528
COURTS AND THE SHERIFF AND SO

00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:40.030
IN THIS INSTANCE IT WOULD BE

00:51:40.096 --> 00:51:42.332
AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY TO ALLOW

00:51:42.399 --> 00:51:46.002
LANDLORDS. TO CREATE A CONTRACT

00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:47.671
THAT SAYS WE'RE GOING TO GO

00:51:47.737 --> 00:51:48.705
WE'RE GOING TO GO OUTSIDE OF

00:51:48.772 --> 00:51:50.907
THE LAW AND I GET TO A BIG DO

00:51:50.974 --> 00:51:53.109
IF I WANT TO- UNDER THE

00:51:53.176 --> 00:51:55.912
CIRCUMSTANCES SO. IT WOULD IT'S

00:51:55.979 --> 00:51:57.781
MY OPINION THAT YOU CANNOT.

00:51:57.848 --> 00:51:59.349
ENTER INTO A CONTRACT THAT

00:51:59.416 --> 00:52:01.618
CONTRAVENES A LAW IS TO ME THAT

00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:03.487
THIS PASSES AND IS SIGNED BY

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:06.656
THE GOVERNOR- THAT IS SET UP TO

00:52:06.723 --> 00:52:08.225
BE IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST TO

00:52:08.291 --> 00:52:10.026
PROTECT LANDLORDS AND TENANT IT

00:52:10.093 --> 00:52:13.129
TELLS THEM WHAT THEIR RIGHTS

00:52:13.196 --> 00:52:13.964
AND RESPONSIBILITIES ARE. AND I

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:15.131
ALSO THINK IF I MAY JUST ADD TO

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:16.433
THAT THE FACT IS THAT WE'RE

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.668
NUMBER AN EMERGENCY SITUATION

00:52:18.735 --> 00:52:19.903
AND THAT DOES GIVE US A MUCH

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:22.038
BROADER POWERS AS WELL. FOR THE

00:52:22.105 --> 00:52:23.773
PUBLIC SAFETY AND WELL BEING

00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.543
AND CERTAINLY IF THERE IS A- A

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:28.745
TO TERMINATE OR I BELIEVE. THAT

00:52:28.812 --> 00:52:30.714
THE RIGHT OF CONTRACT HAS BEEN

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:32.449
UNDULY IT IMPROPERLY INTERFERED

00:52:32.516 --> 00:52:34.251
WITH. WE HAVE A COURT SYSTEM

00:52:34.317 --> 00:52:36.553
THAT WILL RESOLVE THAT ISSUE-

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:37.354
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS CENTER

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:40.624
BORCHERS. YES DOES- I WAS

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:42.359
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS

00:52:42.425 --> 00:52:44.728
RELATES TO TWO MORE RESTRICTIVE

00:52:44.794 --> 00:52:46.263
OR MORE ONEROUS LOCAL

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:49.666
ORDINANCES. SO DID I HEAR YOU

00:52:49.733 --> 00:52:52.836
SAY THAT THIS BECOMES THE

00:52:52.903 --> 00:52:55.272
DOMINANT BODY OF LAW. THAT

00:52:55.338 --> 00:52:58.542
OVERRIDES MORE RESTRICTIVE

00:52:58.608 --> 00:52:59.776
LOCAL ORDINANCES. I THINK I'D

00:52:59.843 --> 00:53:01.278
HAVE TO ASK WHAT YOU MEAN BY

00:53:01.344 --> 00:53:03.013
RESTRICTIVE ORDINANCES I'D

00:53:03.079 --> 00:53:07.851
MENTIONED. IF YOU HAVE A LOCAL

00:53:07.918 --> 00:53:10.520
I'D SAY MUNICIPALITY OR COUNTY

00:53:10.587 --> 00:53:12.188
WITH WHICHEVER ENTITY HAD THE

00:53:12.255 --> 00:53:14.858
LAND USE AUTHORITY- CREATED

00:53:14.925 --> 00:53:20.297
CREATED A ROLE THAT THAT SAYS.

00:53:20.363 --> 00:53:24.701
THAT SAYS THAT. YOU CAN.

00:53:24.768 --> 00:53:29.139
DISALLOW. THE NORMAL

00:53:29.205 --> 00:53:31.841
OPPORTUNITIES TO EVICT A PARTY

00:53:31.908 --> 00:53:33.977
FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW IF

00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:35.745
SOMEONE'S MAKES A LOT OF NOISE

00:53:35.812 --> 00:53:37.614
OR HAS TOO MANY PEOPLE AT THE

00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:38.682
PLACE WHERE THEY PARK THEIR

00:53:38.748 --> 00:53:40.784
VEHICLES INAPPROPRIATELY IN THE

00:53:40.850 --> 00:53:43.219
NORMAL- ARE OTHER EXAMPLES THAT

00:53:43.286 --> 00:53:46.756
ALLOW INDIVIDUALS TO BE EVICTED

00:53:46.823 --> 00:53:50.527
THAT THIS LEGISLATION STILL

00:53:50.594 --> 00:53:53.029
ACKNOWLEDGES AS- ADEQUATE AND

00:53:53.096 --> 00:53:54.864
ARE FORESEEABLE GROUNDS TO

00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:57.033
MAINTAIN THE EVICTION POWERS.

00:53:57.100 --> 00:54:01.338
WHAT IF THE LOWER- LOWER

00:54:01.404 --> 00:54:03.573
MUNICIPALITY HAS RESTRICTIONS

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.675
AGAINST THAT SO DURING CONFLICT

00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:07.844
WHICH ONE WOULD CONTROL SO I

00:54:07.911 --> 00:54:08.612
KNOW THAT THERE THERE ARE A

00:54:08.678 --> 00:54:11.381
NUMBER OF ENTITIES THAT HAVE

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:13.617
PASSED ORDINANCES TO PROTECT

00:54:13.683 --> 00:54:16.620
TENANTS. AND THOSE PROTECTIONS

00:54:16.686 --> 00:54:19.289
WOULD STAY IN PLACE I TELL AND

00:54:19.356 --> 00:54:21.124
THEY'RE SET TO EXPIRE ON ON A

00:54:21.191 --> 00:54:22.859
NATURAL DATE MOST OF THEM HAVE

00:54:22.926 --> 00:54:26.529
A DATE. IN WHICH CASE STATE LAW

00:54:26.596 --> 00:54:28.398
THIS LAW WOULD CONTROL WHEN WE

00:54:28.465 --> 00:54:29.733
SET IT UP THAT WAY BECAUSE WE

00:54:29.799 --> 00:54:31.568
WANT TENANTS TO KNOW THEY'VE

00:54:31.635 --> 00:54:32.736
ARE THEY ALREADY KNOW WHAT'S

00:54:32.802 --> 00:54:33.637
GOING ON IN THEIR LOCAL

00:54:33.703 --> 00:54:35.338
JURISDICTION WE WANT THEM TO

00:54:35.405 --> 00:54:37.173
CONTINUE TO BE PROTECTED. AND

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:40.543
THEN ONCE THEY EXPIRE THIS

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:42.078
PARTICULAR LAW KICKS IN. SO IN

00:54:42.145 --> 00:54:44.447
OTHER WORDS THIS IS. THE OTHER

00:54:44.514 --> 00:54:47.083
LAW OR THIS LAW RATHER IT IS

00:54:47.150 --> 00:54:50.053
SORT OF LIKE THE FLOOR THAT'S

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:52.822
CORRECT OKAY YEAH. OKAY LAST

00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:55.959
QUESTION. FOR YOU DONE. ALL IN

00:54:56.026 --> 00:55:00.063
HERE. I'M STILL POURING OVER

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:02.565
THIS BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT

00:55:02.632 --> 00:55:03.566
THERE'S BEEN SOME REALLY GOOD

00:55:03.633 --> 00:55:06.703
WORK. ON THIS ISSUE I WANT TO

00:55:06.770 --> 00:55:08.738
SPEND MORE TIME MAKING CERTAIN

00:55:08.805 --> 00:55:10.573
THAT I CAN FOLLOW UP WITH FOLKS

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:11.808
WHO HAVE INSIGHTS INTO THE

00:55:11.875 --> 00:55:14.110
INDUSTRY AS WELL AS THOSE THAT

00:55:14.177 --> 00:55:16.246
WILL BE IMPACTED. I'M GOING TO

00:55:16.312 --> 00:55:18.848
SUPPORT THIS TODAY- BUT I

00:55:18.915 --> 00:55:23.219
WANTED FOLKS JUST. TO IT'S

00:55:23.286 --> 00:55:24.888
WONDERFUL TO KNOW THAT I'M

00:55:24.954 --> 00:55:26.022
GONNA BE DOING AS MUCH DUE

00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:27.624
DILIGENCE AS POSSIBLE OVER THE

00:55:27.691 --> 00:55:29.059
NEXT DAY OR SO WHENEVER THIS

00:55:29.125 --> 00:55:31.594
COMES TO. A LOT OF THE FLOOR

00:55:31.661 --> 00:55:33.396
THE FIGURE OUT IF THIS IS AS

00:55:33.463 --> 00:55:36.132
WELL THOUGHT OUT AND AS AS WE

00:55:36.199 --> 00:55:38.101
NEED FOR OUR FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:39.135
BECAUSE WHAT I DON'T WANT TO

00:55:39.202 --> 00:55:41.604
SEE HAPPEN IS THAT THIS GOES TO

00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:43.973
JANUARY TWENTY ONE. IT COMES

00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:46.476
BACK IT IS AS AN EMERGENCY ITEM

00:55:46.543 --> 00:55:48.244
TO THE LEGISLATURE THAT SAYS WE

00:55:48.311 --> 00:55:49.913
NEED SIX MORE MONTHS OF THIS

00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:51.915
PROGRAM BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

00:55:51.981 --> 00:55:57.253
ENOUGH- FINANCIAL- STABILITY IN

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.422
THE MARKET. IN THAT WOULD FOR

00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:00.890
ME I WOULD WOULD BE ON IT

00:56:00.957 --> 00:56:02.425
UNACCEPTABLE IN THE SOME ON

00:56:02.492 --> 00:56:04.194
THIS SIDE. BUT I THINK IT HAS

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:06.262
MERITS IN IT BUT IT DOES ITS

00:56:06.329 --> 00:56:08.765
BEST TO BALANCE OUT THE NEEDS

00:56:08.832 --> 00:56:10.667
BETWEEN THE LANDLORD THE TENANT

00:56:10.734 --> 00:56:12.402

OF CALIFORNIA CREATING A FUND.

ON THE- FEDERAL LEVEL.

00:56:31.287 --> 00:56:32.489
RESULTING IN OUR HAVING TO

00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:34.257
LITERALLY SHUT THE STATE DOWN

00:56:34.324 --> 00:56:35.225

CRAWLING BACK ON OUR KNEES TO

00:56:37.227 --> 00:56:39.496

00:56:39.562 --> 00:56:41.297
THE LACK OF ANY CLEAR CUT

00:56:41.364 --> 00:56:45.001

START SETTING UP THESE FUNDS.

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:50.273

PRINT MONEY. AND WE CAN'T OUR

00:56:57.680 --> 00:56:58.148

GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE THAT

00:57:05.321 --> 00:57:06.756
FUNDING THAT TO YOU BELIEVE IS

00:57:06.823 --> 00:57:09.425
APPROPRIATE- PERHAPS IT IS

00:57:09.492 --> 00:57:11.261
APPROPRIATE. AND THAT'S

00:57:11.327 --> 00:57:12.395
CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE THAT THE

UNPRECEDENTED CRISIS IT'S A

00:57:48.765 --> 00:57:52.869
STOP GAP MEASURE TO RECOGNIZE

00:57:52.936 --> 00:57:56.439
THAT IN TWO DAYS. MILLIONS OF

00:57:56.506 --> 00:57:58.708
CALIFORNIANS ARE GONNA FACE ARE

00:57:58.775 --> 00:58:00.643
GONNA LOSE THE PROTECTION

00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:02.312
EXTENDED BY THE JUDICIAL

00:58:02.378 --> 00:58:04.781

00:58:09.352 --> 00:58:13.089
PROTECTION MOVING FORWARD- BUT

00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:15.825
THE OTHER CHALLENGE HERE IS WE

00:58:15.892 --> 00:58:19.329

WITHOUT WORK THERE'S NOTHING.

00:58:43.386 --> 00:58:43.920
MAGIC THAT HAPPENED SEPTEMBER

00:58:43.987 --> 00:58:44.821
FIRST JUST THIRTY FIRST OR

00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:47.857
FEBRUARY OF NEXT YEAR THE

00:58:47.924 --> 00:58:49.926
GUARANTEES OUR ECONOMY IS

RESTORED IN COVERT NINETEEN IS

00:58:52.295 --> 00:58:54.964
BEHIND US DESPITE PROCLAMATIONS

00:58:55.031 --> 00:58:56.699
FROM CERTAIN ACTORS AT THE

00:58:56.766 --> 00:58:58.801
FEDERAL LEVEL THE COVERT

00:58:58.868 --> 00:59:00.503
NINETEEN IS BEHIND THIS. WE'RE

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:02.338
APPROACHING TWO HUNDRED

00:59:02.405 --> 00:59:05.341
THOUSAND DEATHS NATIONALLY THE

00:59:05.408 --> 00:59:05.909
PROJECTION IS THAT WE WILL

00:59:05.975 --> 00:59:07.977
CERTAINLY HIT THREE HUNDRED

00:59:08.044 --> 00:59:10.146
THOUSAND DEATHS AND THERE ARE

00:59:10.213 --> 00:59:12.015
SOME WHO SEEK TO IGNORE THAT

00:59:12.081 --> 00:59:14.183
REALITY. BUT THAT REALITIES

00:59:14.250 --> 00:59:17.587
BEING FELT THANK EVERYONE IN

THIS STATE SO I'M GOING TO BE

00:59:20.523 --> 00:59:22.458
SUPPORTIVE OFTHIS TODAY BUT I

00:59:22.525 --> 00:59:25.662
STILL I'VE HEARD FROM JUDGES IN

00:59:25.728 --> 00:59:27.463
MY DISTRICT WHO WANT TO KNOW

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:29.565
WHAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE THEY

00:59:29.632 --> 00:59:30.767
FEAR THEY'RE GOING TO BE

00:59:30.833 --> 00:59:34.437
FLOODED WITH THE VACATION-

00:59:34.504 --> 00:59:40.043
LITIGATION. STARTING SEPTEMBER

00:59:40.109 --> 00:59:41.878
FIRST THEY WANNA KNOW QUITE

00:59:41.945 --> 00:59:43.279
QUITE SHOULD WE BE PLANNING FOR

00:59:43.346 --> 00:59:44.981
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHAT'S

00:59:45.048 --> 00:59:47.884
THE LEGISLATURE DOING. I WOULD

00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:49.319
HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN THE

00:59:49.385 --> 00:59:53.456
JUDICIAL COUNCIL- IN LIGHT OF

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:56.526
THE ONGOING PANDEMIC. EXTENDED

00:59:56.592 --> 00:59:59.862
THE EMERGENCY RELIEF THAT HAD

00:59:59.929 --> 01:00:01.331
BEEN EXTENDED EXPIRES SEPTEMBER

01:00:01.397 --> 01:00:04.534
FIRST. I DON'T KNOW ALL THE

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.269
REASONS FOR THEIR RELUCTANCE

01:00:06.336 --> 01:00:08.771
BUT APPARENTLY THEY FEAR.

01:00:08.838 --> 01:00:10.740
LAWSUIT SWUNG MAYBE THEY SHOULD

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:12.742
BE STANDING UP FOR US AS WE

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:14.510
KNOW AS THE LEGISLATURE TRYING

01:00:14.577 --> 01:00:16.746
TO STAND UP FOR THE PEOPLE.

01:00:16.813 --> 01:00:20.650
THAT WE REPRESENT. THIS BILL

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:22.652
SEEKS TO SATISFY MULTIPLE

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:24.721
INTERESTS AND YET I THINK IT'S

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:27.290
UNREALISTIC TO THINK OF FAMILY

01:00:27.357 --> 01:00:29.859
WITHOUT EMPLOYMENT. WITHOUT ANY

01:00:29.926 --> 01:00:32.462
EXTENSION OF THE CARE SACKED OR

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:35.331
UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS- OR ANY

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:38.167
OTHER TYPE OF ECONOMIC RELIEF.

01:00:38.234 --> 01:00:41.437
WILL BE ABLE TO PAY 25% SOME

01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:43.006
MIGHT BE ABLE TO BE.

01:00:43.072 --> 01:00:46.042
SACRIFICING FOOD OR MEDICINE TO

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:49.012
SCRAPE TOGETHER 25% OF THE RENT

01:00:49.078 --> 01:00:50.513
THERE'S NO MAGIC NUMBER HERE

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:54.150
AND IF THE FAMILY. IS IMPACTED

01:00:54.217 --> 01:00:57.387
BY COVERT NINETEEN. IN THIS IS.

01:00:57.453 --> 01:01:01.290
TENANTS AND PROPERTY OWNERS- WE

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:04.994
LOOK TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT-IS THE CHAIR HAS SAID IN THE

01:01:05.061 --> 01:01:05.928
INACTION OF THE FEDERAL

01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:09.332
GOVERNMENT. TO COMMIT TO

01:01:09.399 --> 01:01:11.367
FURTHER ECONOMIC RELIEF NOT

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:13.036
JUST FOR CALIFORNIANS BUT FOR

01:01:13.102 --> 01:01:15.571
ALL AMERICANS. IS AT THE CORE

01:01:15.638 --> 01:01:18.875
OF THIS CRISIS. IN THE SOLUTION

01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:22.145
IS NOT TO BE FOUND IN A LABORAT

01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:25.314
PUZZLES OF YOU PAY 25% NOW AND

01:01:25.381 --> 01:01:26.816
YOU CARRY THIS AND THAT AND

01:01:26.883 --> 01:01:28.217
THEN IT TO DO AND THEN YOU CAN

01:01:28.284 --> 01:01:30.186
BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:33.823
AND STILL FACE EVICTION. THAT'S

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:36.392
NOT A SOLUTION IT'S SOME FIRST

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:40.396
AID TO TRY TO FORESTALL. THE

01:01:40.463 --> 01:01:42.799
INEVITABLE SO I WILL BE

01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:45.034
SUPPORTING THIS TODAY BUT WITH

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:46.469
THE RESERVATIONS THAT I HAVE

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.738
ARTICULATED AND THAT WE

01:01:48.805 --> 01:01:51.441
SHOULDN'T WAIT UNTIL. JANUARY

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:53.376
OR FEBRUARY OF NEXT YEAR TO

01:01:53.443 --> 01:01:55.445
START FIGURING OUT THE

01:01:55.511 --> 01:01:57.080
SEQUENTIAL BILL I JUST SAY TO

01:01:57.146 --> 01:01:58.815
MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO.

01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:01.684
THERE'S NO MAGIC DATE BY WHICH

01:02:01.751 --> 01:02:07.156
THEY SHOULD END THE MAGIC DATE

01:02:07.223 --> 01:02:08.558
REALLY BEHIND THIS AND OUR

01:02:08.624 --> 01:02:10.626
ECONOMY IS RESTORED IN PEOPLE

01:02:10.693 --> 01:02:13.296
CAN GO BACK TO WORK AND THEY

01:02:13.362 --> 01:02:15.231
CAN WORK AND PAY THEIR RENT-

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:17.467
AND HAVE THE SECURITY OF THAT

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:19.669
INTEL WE'RE AT THAT POINT. THE

01:02:19.735 --> 01:02:21.404
IN SECURITY WILL CONTINUE TO

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:23.940
HANG OVER THE HEADS OF ALL

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:26.442
CALIFORNIANS OF ALL AMERICANS

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:26.943
AND THERE WILL BE MORE

01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:28.845
HOMELESSNESS IT'LL BE MORE

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:31.547
SUFFERING FROM NOT JUST THE

01:02:31.614 --> 01:02:33.316
DIRECT MEDICAL IMPACTS OF

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:35.218
COVERT NINETEEN BUT THE RELATED

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:37.286
IMPACTS OF MENTAL HEALTH

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:40.022
ISSUES- SUBSTANCE ABUSE

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:42.758
EVERYTHING THAT'S UNFOLDING AS

01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:46.529
A RESULT. OF OUR INABILITY. TO

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:49.432
GET IN FRONT OF COVERT NINETEEN

01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:51.000
SO AGAIN I THINK THE AUTHORS

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:53.136
MORE OF A STATEMENT NOT REALLY

01:02:53.202 --> 01:02:56.439
A QUESTION- I GUESS JUST IT TO

01:02:56.506 --> 01:03:00.977
MAYBE. SHARE A QUESTION FROM.

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:03.146
WHAT'S THE COMMITMENT OF THE

01:03:03.212 --> 01:03:05.348
PARTIES INVOLVED IN THIS

01:03:05.414 --> 01:03:07.783
AGREEMENT TO KEEP WORKING

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:10.386
BETWEEN NO AND THE EXPIRATION

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:12.822
OF THESE TEMPORARY RELIEF

01:03:12.889 --> 01:03:16.359
MEASURES. IT MADE UP EVERYONE

01:03:16.425 --> 01:03:17.260
IS TO CONTINUE WORKING OVER THE

01:03:17.326 --> 01:03:19.195
FALL TO START THE DAY AFTER

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:21.197
WE'RE DONE. WE KNOW THERE'S A

01:03:21.264 --> 01:03:22.865
LOT MORE WORK TO DO AND PART OF

01:03:22.932 --> 01:03:24.800
IT IS MAKE IS CONTINUING TO

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:26.135
COME TO THE TABLE I MEAN

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:27.837
EVERYTHING EVERYBODY HAS SAID

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:29.438
IT'S REALLY TRUE WE DON'T KNOW

01:03:29.505 --> 01:03:31.407
WHEN THIS IS GOING TO END WE

01:03:31.474 --> 01:03:33.643
DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT THE STATE.

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:35.912
FISCAL SITUATIONS GOING TO BE-

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:38.080
WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER PEOPLE

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:39.949
ARE GOING TO START GOING BACK

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:42.518
TO WORK THE NEW I THINK THE NEW

01:03:42.585 --> 01:03:44.020
FRAMEWORK THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:44.687
LAID OUT WITH THE DIFFERENT

01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:46.489
COLORS AND KIND OF GOING BACK

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:48.257
MAKES TOTAL SENSE AND WE SHOULD

01:03:48.324 --> 01:03:49.692
PROBABLY STARTED THAT TWO

01:03:49.759 --> 01:03:51.360

THIS. LET ME JUST SAY THAT THIS

01:04:03.806 --> 01:04:06.609
ALL HAS TO DO WITH MONEY MMHM

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.811
IT'S RESOURCES AND TO THE

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:09.979
CHALLENGES WERE LOOKING AT THE

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:11.113
CRYSTAL BALL TRYING TO FIGURE

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:12.081

01:04:18.854 --> 01:04:21.390
LIKE AND HOW CAN WE USE THEM TO

01:04:21.457 --> 01:04:23.693
LEVERAGE OTHER RESOURCES

01:04:23.759 --> 01:04:24.393
WHETHER IT'S THE BANK OR THE

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.928
CREDIT UNIONS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:28.965
MONEY IS. IS CHEAP IF YOU CAN

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:31.601
BORROW IT. BUT NO ONE CAN RIGHT

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.569
SO HERE WHAT'S THE PERFECT

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:34.470
COMBINATION THERE'S A

01:04:34.537 --> 01:04:35.671
COMMITMENT TO WORK I CAN TELL

YOU THAT RIGHT THANK YOU I

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:38.808
APPRECIATE A MAN SHOULD JUST

01:04:38.874 --> 01:04:41.444
KIND OF A FINAL COMMENT. AS AS

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:43.279
THE AUTHOR SAID THE CO AUTHOR.

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:46.015
IT'S ALL ABOUT MONEY. BUT THE

01:04:46.082 --> 01:04:48.284
MONEY AVAILABLE TO. A WORKING

01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:50.753
FAMILY ON A LIMITED INCOME.

01:04:50.820 --> 01:04:53.155
STRETCHING TO RAISE RENT MONEY

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:55.358
EACH MONTH. IS DIFFERENT THAN

01:04:55.424 --> 01:04:57.193
THE BURDEN. ON A LARGE

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:59.595
FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. THAT IS

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:01.430
AN INTEREST GROUP THEY HAVE AN

01:05:01.497 --> 01:05:02.164
INTEREST IN GETTING THEIR

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:05.101
MONEY- BUT THERE EXECUTIVES

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:07.169
MAKING TENS OF MILLIONS OF

01:05:07.236 --> 01:05:08.871
DOLLARS A YEAR. THEY'RE NOT

01:05:08.938 --> 01:05:12.675
BEING ASKED TO FOR BEAR ON.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:15.678
HUGE INCOMES. THERE IS SOME

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:18.681
RELATIVE. A HUGE RELATIVE

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:20.116
DIFFERENCE IN THE ABILITY TO

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:25.254
SHOULDER ON THE PAIN OF THIS SO

01:05:25.321 --> 01:05:26.956
ARE BETTER ABLE TO FOUR BETTER

01:05:27.023 --> 01:05:29.425
THAN OTHERS- SO THANK YOU MADAM

AND THAT'S PART OF I THINK THE

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:38.701
EFFORT THAT'S BEEN MADE. OF

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:40.503
AGAIN WE DON'T EVEN KNOW

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:41.737
WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO SEE

01:05:41.804 --> 01:05:43.439
ANYTHING MORE COME OUT OF THE

01:05:43.506 --> 01:05:45.041
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WOULD

01:05:45.107 --> 01:05:47.243
LOOK AT WHETHER THEY CAN BE

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:48.377
EXTENSIONS OF THE CARES ACTON.

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:52.114
ARMY IT'S JUST SO ON KNOWN WE

01:05:52.181 --> 01:05:54.617
ARE LIVING IN UNCHARTED WATERS.

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:57.153
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT LEVEL OF

01:05:57.219 --> 01:05:59.288
LEADERSHIP WE'RE GOING TO SEE.

01:05:59.355 --> 01:06:01.357
THE STATE IS DOING ITS BEST TO

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:03.326
ALL FIFTY STATES HAVE FIFTY

01:06:03.392 --> 01:06:04.493
DIFFERENT SETS OF RULES

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.128
COUNTIES HAVE. FIFTY EIGHT

01:06:06.195 --> 01:06:07.330
DIFFERENT SETS OF RULES IN THIS

01:06:07.396 --> 01:06:09.699
IS. THIS A SITUATION WHERE WE

01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:11.634
WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO HAVE A

01:06:11.701 --> 01:06:14.136
QUICK CANCER OR EIGHT A CLEAR

01:06:14.203 --> 01:06:15.938
ANSWER SO I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:17.973
THE EFFORTS GOING TO BE MADE.

THROUGHOUT AS THEY SHOULD BE

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:20.576
BECAUSE- AGAIN PEOPLE ARE

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:23.346
SUFFERING AND- ONE OF THE

01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:25.981
THINGS THAT I NOTICED THIS DOES

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:29.218
NOT. IN IN ANY WAY. EITHER

01:06:29.285 --> 01:06:30.920
REDUCE THE OBLIGATION TO PAY

01:06:30.986 --> 01:06:32.321

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:36.359
PAY BACK RENT. OF THE

01:06:36.425 --> 01:06:38.527
OBLIGATION BECOMES UP UP AS A

01:06:38.594 --> 01:06:42.264
CREDIT. AND THE- TENANT IS

01:06:42.331 --> 01:06:43.799
PROTECTED BECAUSE THAT DOES NOT

01:06:43.866 --> 01:06:45.534
GET REPORTED TO THE CREDIT

01:06:45.601 --> 01:06:47.336
AGENCIES. RIGHT BUT THE

01:06:47.403 --> 01:06:49.438
OBLIGATION CONTINUES IT IS IT

01:06:49.505 --> 01:06:51.707

PAID. I MEAN THERE'S A WAY TO

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:01.484
BE ABLE TO TRY TO ENFORCE THEM

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:03.652

01:07:03.719 --> 01:07:04.520

THIS WITH WITH MY OWN DISTRICT.

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.085
MY DISTRICT IN LOS ANGELES HAS

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:37.486
THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:40.523
RENTERS IN THE ENTIRE STATE.

01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:42.391
SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT. OF THE

MEN WOMEN IN MY DISTRICT ARE

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:49.532
RENTERS. THE IMPACT OF THAT IS

01:07:49.598 --> 01:07:54.303
GOING TO BE SEVERE. AND

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:55.971
OVERWHELMING. MANY OF THESE

01:07:56.038 --> 01:07:58.441
NEIGHBORHOODS ARE SOME WELL OFF

01:07:58.507 --> 01:08:00.309
NEIGHBORHOODS BUT MOST OF THEM

ARE WORKING CLASS IMMIGRANT

01:08:02.211 --> 01:08:04.747
COMMUNITIES WE ALSO HAVE THE

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:05.881
HELP OF SOME OF THE HIGHEST

01:08:05.948 --> 01:08:08.117
PERCENTAGE OF OVERCROWDED

01:08:08.184 --> 01:08:10.319
CONDITIONS OVERCROWDING MEANING

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:13.789
MORE THAN OF A RATIONAL NUMBER

01:08:13.856 --> 01:08:18.093
OF PEOPLE PER ROOM OVERCROWDED.

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:21.297
THEY WORK AND ESSENTIAL JOBS

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:23.799
WHERE THEY ALSO ARE NOW FACING

01:08:23.866 --> 01:08:25.568
CIRCLE BY YOUR NOSE THIS FOR

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:27.269
OUR REPRESENTING OUR

01:08:27.336 --> 01:08:29.472
AGRICULTURE AND THE JOBS OF THE

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:34.109
FARMWORKERS TO. ESSENTIAL WORK

01:08:34.176 --> 01:08:37.079
ESSENTIAL WORKERS. AND THESE

01:08:37.146 --> 01:08:37.880
ARE THE CONDITIONS THAT THEY

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:39.849
LIVED IN. PART OF THE REALITY

01:08:39.915 --> 01:08:42.585
WE'RE FACING HERE TODAY IS THAT

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:44.553
THERE WAS ALREADY AN EMERGENCY

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:47.990
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. THERE WAS

01:08:48.057 --> 01:08:48.924
ALREADY AN EMERGENCY. THAT WE

01:08:48.991 --> 01:08:53.362
WERE NOT SOLVING. THERE WAS AN

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:54.930
EMERGENCY AS FAR AS HOUSING

01:08:54.997 --> 01:08:56.365
THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY AS FAR

01:08:56.432 --> 01:08:59.001
AS HOMELESSNESS AND SO WE IT'S

01:08:59.068 --> 01:09:00.903
NOT LIKE THIS JUST JUMPED OUT

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:04.306
AT US ALL OF A SUDDEN IT DID

01:09:04.373 --> 01:09:07.042
BUT HAD WE NOT HAD THOSE

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:09.378
CONDITIONS BEFOREHAND I THINK

01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:11.347
IT MIGHT OF YOU KNOW WHO KNOWS

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:12.314
MIGHT A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:15.251
MANAGEABLE. TENANTS DID NOT

01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:17.987
WERE NOT STABLE PRIOR TO THE

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:20.055
PANDEMIC AND THAT'S THAT'S

01:09:20.122 --> 01:09:21.891
SOMETHING WE HAVE TO PUT HERE

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:24.260
IN THE CONVERSATION AS WELL AND

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:25.594
I KNOW SOME OF US TRIED TO WORK

01:09:25.661 --> 01:09:27.730
WITH THEM AS A WORKING GROUP

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:29.632
HOUSING WORKING GROUP WHILE WE

01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:31.333
WERE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.768
AT THE SAME TIME TRYING TO

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:34.737
THINK MID TERM AND LONG TERM AS

01:09:34.803 --> 01:09:37.006
FAR AS HOUSING BUT TENANTS

01:09:37.072 --> 01:09:39.141
STABILIZATION IS AN EMERGENCY

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:40.976
BEFORE HAND AND IT'S EVEN MORE

01:09:41.043 --> 01:09:43.445
OF AN EMERGENCY NOW. I HAD

01:09:43.512 --> 01:09:46.582
SEVERAL BILLS ALONG WITH ALL

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:48.317
FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO A. B.

01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:49.652
FOURTEEN EIGHTY TWO ABOUT RENT

01:09:49.718 --> 01:09:51.987
RENTERS ABOUT THEM BEING ABLE

01:09:52.054 --> 01:09:53.489
TO STAY IN THE HOMES ABOUT THEM

01:09:53.556 --> 01:09:55.591
BEING ABLE TO STAY IN SPITE OF

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:58.127
THE GENTRIFICATION IN SPITE OF

01:09:58.193 --> 01:10:00.663
THE PUSH OUT SO THAT OTHERS

01:10:00.729 --> 01:10:05.668
COULDN'T MOVE IN AND. TAKE OVER

01:10:05.734 --> 01:10:06.902
THEIR THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO THE-

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:09.572
OUT ECONOMIC INTEREST THEY ARE

01:10:09.638 --> 01:10:10.773
OUTSIDE ECONOMIC INTERESTS FROM

01:10:10.839 --> 01:10:12.241
THOSE WHO REALLY CARE ABOUT OUR

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:14.476
NEIGHBORHOODS. IS GETTING HAS

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:16.145
GOTTEN IN THE WAY IT ALWAYS HAS

01:10:16.211 --> 01:10:19.448
pBEEN THE ONE TO GET IN THE WAY

01:10:19.515 --> 01:10:22.151
OF TRYING TO GET BETTER TENANT

01:10:22.217 --> 01:10:24.687
PROTECTIONS. AND YOU KNOW WE

01:10:24.753 --> 01:10:27.823
HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES. WHAT ARE

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:29.058
WE GONNA TAKE WAS WHERE WE- CAN

01:10:29.124 --> 01:10:31.327
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. FOR THE

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:33.495
FACT THAT. THIS PROPOSAL

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:35.331
CHANGED FROM SOMETHING THAT WAS

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:37.566
MUCH MORE. IT WAS STILL A SHORT

01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:40.302
TERM BUT IT CHANGED IN A MATTER

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:42.471
OF WHAT A WEEK. IN A MATTER OF%

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:47.543
A WEEK. SO I FIND MYSELF LIKE

01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:49.411
THIS IS TERRIBLE WHY WE LET

01:10:49.478 --> 01:10:51.213
THIS HAPPEN FROM A WEEK AGO TO

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.816
TODAY. WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO

01:10:53.882 --> 01:10:58.554

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:11.627
THEY NEEDED THAT CHECK TO HELP

01:12:11.694 --> 01:12:13.796
THEM KEEP THEIR APARTMENT IN

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:14.430
SPITE OF THE FACT THAT WE HAD A

01:12:14.496 --> 01:12:18.233
MORATORIUM. IN SPITE OF THAT.

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:18.834

01:12:27.409 --> 01:12:29.845
DESPERATE THEY- PUT ASIDE

WORDS YOU CAN COLLECTED IN

01:14:44.413 --> 01:14:45.480
SMALL CLAIMS COURT THIS WILL

01:14:45.547 --> 01:14:47.683
PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

01:14:47.749 --> 01:14:49.184
LANDLORD NOT TO GO THROUGH A

01:14:49.251 --> 01:14:53.055
SUPERIOR COURT CASE IN ITS ITS

01:14:53.121 --> 01:14:53.655
LENGTHY. LIKELY TO COST A LOT

01:14:53.722 --> 01:14:55.157
OF MONEY AND ALSO LIKELY TO BE

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:56.558
SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED THERE ARE

01:14:56.625 --> 01:14:57.459
OTHER PRIORITIES THE COURTS

01:14:57.526 --> 01:14:59.261
HAVE BEEN OUT OF SESSION FOR AS

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:02.130
LONG AS WE WERE TO. SO IT WOULD

01:15:02.197 --> 01:15:03.799
BECOME A DEBT PAYABLE A

01:15:03.866 --> 01:15:05.000
COLLECTIBLE THROUGH SMALL

01:15:05.067 --> 01:15:06.268
CLAIMS COURT ITSELF IT'S FAIRLY

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:08.303
EASY TO FILE THE PAPERWORK AND

01:15:08.370 --> 01:15:10.272
TO GO AND IT PROVIDES AN

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:11.773
ALTERNATIVE FOR THE TEN IT IS

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.108
WELL. TO BE ABLE TO GO AND

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:14.710
DEFEND THEMSELVES OR SAY YEAH I

01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:16.979
DO IT AND OR OR THE AMOUNT IS

01:15:17.045 --> 01:15:19.281
DIFFERENT AND HERE'S WHAT I'LL-

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:21.416
AFTER ONCE I GET A JUDGMENT AND

01:15:21.483 --> 01:15:22.818
THEY COLLECTED JUST LIKE ANY

01:15:22.885 --> 01:15:24.586
ANY JUDGMENT ON THEY HAVE THE

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:26.622
RIGHT TO ASK. FOR INFORMATION

01:15:26.688 --> 01:15:28.223
ABOUT WHETHER THE TEN TO TEN

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:30.659
AND IS WORKING OR NOT TO DO AT.

01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:34.696
A CREDITOR ED JET THAT. I'M

01:15:34.763 --> 01:15:35.764
DRAWING A BLANK ON THE WORD TO

01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:37.466
BUT THE- THEY HAD AN

01:15:37.532 --> 01:15:38.867
OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN WITH

01:15:38.934 --> 01:15:41.770
THE- TENANT. AND TO ASK THEM

01:15:41.837 --> 01:15:43.171
QUESTIONS AND USE THAT

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:45.374
INFORMATION TO DO TO GET IN A

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.576
COURT ORDER TO THEN- STARTED

01:15:47.643 --> 01:15:49.378
CATCHING WAGES OR ANYTHING ELSE

01:15:49.444 --> 01:15:50.312
THAT THEY MAKE. THAT THEY MAY

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:52.514
HAVE SO IT BECOMES A DEBT LIKE

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:53.749
ANY OTHER DEBT THE ONLY

01:15:53.815 --> 01:15:55.417
DIFFERENCE IS THAT IT DOES NOT

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:57.920
GET REPORTED TO THE- CREDIT

01:15:57.986 --> 01:15:59.221
REPORTING AGENCY SO THAT IT

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:00.789

THEIR THEIR OPPORTUNITY GET

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:04.993
LOANS AND- IN THE FUTURE HE

01:16:06.561 --> 01:16:08.030
LETTERHEADS AMINATION THAT'S

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:10.332

WORK IF YOU HAVE. AT TEN THAT

01:16:20.876 --> 01:16:21.376
WOULD NOW BE PROTECT. UNDER

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:22.911
THIS BELT LET'S SAY. IN

01:16:22.978 --> 01:16:25.948
ADDITION TO NOT. BEING ABLE TO

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:27.716
PAY THEIR RENT. AND THEY ARE

01:16:27.783 --> 01:16:30.552
ALSO NOT COMPLYING WITH. THE

01:16:30.619 --> 01:16:32.187
RULES AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:34.489
WEATHER BACK TO NATURE WHERE

BOARD JUST POINT OUT IF YOU'VE

01:16:42.030 --> 01:16:43.999
GOT PEOPLE WHO WERE HAVING LOUD

01:16:44.066 --> 01:16:46.501
PARTIES WHO ARE PARKING WHERE

01:16:46.568 --> 01:16:47.436
THEY'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO YOU

01:16:47.502 --> 01:16:49.104
KNOW JUST DOING ARE NOT BEING A

01:16:49.171 --> 01:16:51.506
GOOD TENANT ARE THEY- THIS LAW

01:16:51.573 --> 01:16:54.009
AND THEN- CAN PROTECT THAT TYPE

01:16:54.076 --> 01:16:56.178
OF BEHAVIOR AS WELL NO IT DOES

01:16:56.244 --> 01:16:58.447
NOT. IT DOESN'T IT DOES NOT

01:16:58.513 --> 01:17:01.350
KNOW ANY IS A NORMAL- BASIS FOR

01:17:01.416 --> 01:17:03.385
EVICTION OTHER THAN NON PAYMENT

01:17:03.452 --> 01:17:05.687
OF RENT STILL APPLY SO IF YOU

01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:08.724
HAD A TENANT WHO IS CAUSING

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:10.959
WASTE TO THE PROPERTY OR

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:13.829
CREATING NUISANCE. TO THE LEVEL

01:17:13.895 --> 01:17:19.468
OF A TERM OF THE FOR INNOVATION.

01:17:19.534 --> 01:17:19.968
THOSE VISIONS ARE STILL

01:17:20.035 --> 01:17:21.570
APPROPRIATE. BUT EVEN IS THAT

01:17:21.636 --> 01:17:24.539
ALSO. EVEN IF THEY HAVE

01:17:24.606 --> 01:17:26.108
SUBMITTED THEIR LETTER SAYING

01:17:26.174 --> 01:17:27.442
THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO PAY THE

01:17:27.509 --> 01:17:29.144
RENT DUE TO COME IN FOR IT

01:17:29.211 --> 01:17:32.647
ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY OKAY IT

01:17:32.714 --> 01:17:34.349
DOESN'T IT'S NOT AN EXCUSE.

01:17:34.416 --> 01:17:35.717
OKAY I JUST WANTED TO SORT OF

01:17:35.784 --> 01:17:37.386
MAKE SURE I WAS CLEAR ON THIS

01:17:37.452 --> 01:17:38.720
BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS

01:17:38.787 --> 01:17:40.055
PROBABLY GOING TO CAUSE SOME

01:17:40.122 --> 01:17:42.224
CONFUSION FOR LANDLORDS AND

01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:45.127
TENANTS- I JUST WANT TO MAKE A

01:17:45.193 --> 01:17:48.263
COUPLE COMMENTS- YOU KNOW I'VE

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:51.733
HEARD A LOT OF. OUR STATEMENTS

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.200
ABOUT WHAT THE FEDERAL

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:54.136
GOVERNMENT. HASN'T DONE WHAT

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:55.103
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:56.505
BE DOING THAT HASN'T BEEN

01:17:56.571 --> 01:17:57.339
ENOUGH THERE HASN'T BEEN

01:17:57.406 --> 01:18:01.543
ANYTHING I JUST. WANT TO POINT

01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:04.379
OUT THAT IT. NUMBER ONE IF THE

01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:06.014
GOVERNOR WOULD ALLOW MORE

01:18:06.081 --> 01:18:07.983
SECTORS OF OUR INDUSTRY TO OPEN

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:09.851
UP PEOPLE TO GO BACK TO WORK

01:18:09.918 --> 01:18:11.753
AND HAVE THE MONEY IN ORDER TO

01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:12.521
PAY THE RENT AND HE'S NOT

01:18:12.587 --> 01:18:13.855
ALLOWED THAT TO HAPPEN SO I

01:18:13.922 --> 01:18:15.190
THINK WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK.

01:18:15.257 --> 01:18:16.291
IN THE MIRROR WHEN WE'RE

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:18.226
DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE BECAUSE

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:19.995
WE ARE NOT WITHOUT FAULT I

01:18:20.062 --> 01:18:20.962
THIS RESPECT OR AT LEAST THE

01:18:21.029 --> 01:18:23.198
GOVERNOR IS IN MY EYES HE JUST

01:18:23.265 --> 01:18:25.233
RELEASED. A NEW YOU KNOW NEW

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:26.835
RULES OF ENGAGEMENT FOR COUNTY

01:18:26.902 --> 01:18:28.537
STEPPING UP AND PEOPLE CAN'T

01:18:28.603 --> 01:18:30.472
EVEN UNDERSTAND THAT SO I THINK

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:31.907
THAT NEEDS TO BE TALKED ABOUT

01:18:31.973 --> 01:18:37.012
AS WELL NUMBER TWO. IT YOU KNOW

01:18:37.079 --> 01:18:37.946
THE COST OF LIVING IN

01:18:38.013 --> 01:18:40.148
CALIFORNIA. IS EXTREMELY HIGH

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:41.316
THE COST OF BRENT AND

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:43.852
CALIFORNIA IS INCREDIBLY HIGH.

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:44.753
THAT IS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.188
FEDERAL GVERNMENT THAT HAS TO

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:46.755
DO WITH THE POLICY THAT HAVE

01:18:46.822 --> 01:18:48.924
BEEN PUT IN PLACE. BY OUR

01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:50.959
LEGISLATURE. IS ABSOLUTELY

01:18:51.026 --> 01:18:51.793
NOTHING TO DO WITH THE

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:54.129
GOVERNMENT SO AGAIN I SUGGEST

01:18:54.196 --> 01:18:55.897
RATHER THAN. POINTING FINGER

01:18:55.964 --> 01:18:56.998
SOLELY AT THE FEDERAL

01:18:57.065 --> 01:18:58.100
GOVERNMENT WE TAKE A HARD LOOK

01:18:58.166 --> 01:18:59.901
IN THE MIRROR AND ACKNOWLEDGE

01:18:59.968 --> 01:19:01.403
THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:04.573
RESPONSIBILITY FOR AS WELL- ALL

01:19:04.639 --> 01:19:07.042
RIGHT. THIS THIS IS AN ISSUE

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:08.677
THAT HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY

01:19:08.743 --> 01:19:10.579
ON PINS AND NEEDLES- FOR SURE

01:19:10.645 --> 01:19:12.547

SHOULD BE OPENING UP YOU KNOW

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:39.141
IT'S REALLY A QUESTION OF HOW

01:19:39.207 --> 01:19:41.376
MUCH WE VALUE HUMAN LIFE. BUT

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:42.811
WE'VE HAD TEN THOUSAND

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:45.180
CALIFORNIANS STOCK. TEN

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:46.681
THOUSAND MINUTES. TO AN

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:49.518
EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF PEOPLE-

01:19:49.584 --> 01:19:52.087
THAT. BY MAY IF WE IF WE HAD

01:19:52.154 --> 01:19:54.422
NOT. IF WE HAD NOT CLOSED THE

01:19:54.489 --> 01:19:56.658
STATE. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT

01:19:56.725 --> 01:19:59.961
WHAT HAPPENED IN NEW YORK.

01:20:00.028 --> 01:20:00.495
THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:01.129
THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED WITHIN A

01:20:01.196 --> 01:20:02.797
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE-

01:20:02.864 --> 01:20:05.467
OF COLD IT. WAS RUNNING RAMPANT

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:08.336
SO- I YOU KNOW I THINK WE'LL

01:20:08.403 --> 01:20:09.905
ALL BE. MONDAY MORNING

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:11.606
QUARTERBACKS ON THIS FOR A LONG

01:20:11.673 --> 01:20:13.875
TIME AS TO. WHAT WE SHOULD AND

01:20:13.942 --> 01:20:14.643
SHOULDN'T HAVE SHOULD NOT HAVE

01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:17.812
DONE- AS FAR AS CALIFORNIA

01:20:17.879 --> 01:20:20.015
BEING AN EXPENSIVE STATE IT IS

01:20:20.081 --> 01:20:22.217
INDEED AN EXPENSIVE STATE IT'S

01:20:22.284 --> 01:20:24.452
A BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO LIVE. AND

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:26.188
SO THE VALUE OF PROPERTY. A

01:20:26.254 --> 01:20:27.656
SOMETHING A PRIVATE PROPERTY

01:20:27.722 --> 01:20:29.591
RIGHTS THE VALUE PROPERTY IS

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:33.228
VERY EXPENSIVE- SO. A ONE COULD

01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:34.362
ARGUE THAT THE COST OF

01:20:34.429 --> 01:20:36.431
BUILDING. A IS MORE EXPENSIVE

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:38.266
THAN IT MIGHT BE BUT IT ALSO IS

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:40.068
RESPONSIBLE FOR US HAVING THE

01:20:40.135 --> 01:20:41.236
QUALITY OF LIFE WE HAVE HERE

01:20:41.303 --> 01:20:43.205
SO. THERE ARE CERTAINLY ISSUES

01:20:43.271 --> 01:20:46.141
THAT WE CAN. AGREE ON AN AGREE

01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:47.609
TO DISAGREE ON BUT THERE ARE

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:49.511
CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES THAT

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:51.479
I THINK WE'RE ADDRESSING HERE-

01:20:51.546 --> 01:20:52.981
THAT THIS BILL TRIES TO ADDRESS

01:20:53.048 --> 01:20:54.683
THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF A BIGGER

01:20:54.749 --> 01:20:56.551
PROBLEM. ASSOCIATED WITH A

01:20:56.618 --> 01:20:58.587
PANDEMIC FOR WHICH WE STILL TO

01:20:58.653 --> 01:21:00.222
THE STATE. HAVE VERY LITTLE

01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:02.724
TREATMENT- WE HAVE NO CURE AND

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:06.695
WE HAVE NO VACCINE. AND THAT'S

01:21:06.761 --> 01:21:07.229
PART OF THE NKNOWN THAT I

01:21:07.295 --> 01:21:08.230
THINK WE'RE ALL TO DEAL WITH SO.

01:21:08.296 --> 01:21:09.631

THAT DISCUSSION WAS VERY

01:22:03.718 --> 01:22:05.186
SIMILAR TO THE MANY MANY MANY

01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:06.721
HOURS OF CONVERSATIONS THAT WE

01:22:06.788 --> 01:22:08.089
HAD AMONG OURSELVES TRYING TO

01:22:08.156 --> 01:22:10.558
FIGURE OUT. HOW WE WERE GOING

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:11.760
TO BE ABLE TO GET TO YES THE

01:22:11.826 --> 01:22:13.662
REALITY OF THE SITUATION S

01:22:13.728 --> 01:22:15.630
WORK. THIS IS A NEGOTIATION

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:17.365
BETWEEN THE SENATE THE ASSEMBLY

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:20.035
AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. AND

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:23.805
WHILE- IN ARBIL SB FOURTEEN TEN

01:22:23.872 --> 01:22:24.773
WE THOUGHT THE STATE OUGHT TO

01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:26.441
BE PUTTING UP SOME MONEY. TO BE

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:29.711
ABLE TO. HELP TO- CREATE

01:22:29.778 --> 01:22:32.514
OPPORTUNITIES WHETHER IT WAS-

01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:34.049
THROUGH A TAX CREDIT OR WHETHER

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:36.351
IT WAS TO LEVERAGE. MONIES THAT

01:22:36.418 --> 01:22:38.920
BANKS HAD- WE JUST COULDN'T GET

01:22:38.987 --> 01:22:40.021
THERE IN THE IN THE AMOUNT OF

01:22:40.088 --> 01:22:41.423
TIME THAT WE HAD IT AND

01:22:41.489 --> 01:22:44.025
FRANKLY. ARE PART OF THE REASON

01:22:44.092 --> 01:22:45.894
IS BECAUSE OF THE UNKNOWNS THE

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:49.731
UNKNOWNS YOU KNOW WHEN IS THIS

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:50.332
PANDEMIC GOING TO GOING TO A-

01:22:50.398 --> 01:22:52.534
OR- IS IT ACTUALLY GOING TO

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:55.303
START. GOING DOWN UP WE JUST

01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:55.904
HAVEN'T SEEN IT AND I WERE.

01:22:55.970 --> 01:22:57.672
BACK IN APRIL WHEN THEY SAID WE

01:22:57.739 --> 01:22:58.506
THINK THE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO

01:22:58.573 --> 01:23:00.542
GO UP GO DOWN IN JUNE AND WHEN

01:23:00.608 --> 01:23:01.910
THAT WHEN THE SUMMERS HERE AND

01:23:01.976 --> 01:23:03.578
I THOUGHT JUNE ALL MY GOSH

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:04.913
THAT'S SO FAR AWAY AND HERE WE

01:23:04.979 --> 01:23:06.915
ARE IN ITS SEPTEMBER. IN TWO

01:23:06.981 --> 01:23:09.617
DAYS AND SO- ALL OUR PROJECT

01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:11.219
PROJECTIONS AND PREDICTIONS FOR

01:23:11.286 --> 01:23:12.787
THIS VIRUS HAVE HAVE GONE OUT

01:23:12.854 --> 01:23:14.823
THE WINDOW AND SO. THIS IS AN

01:23:14.889 --> 01:23:16.691
ATTEMPT TO GET US THROUGH THE

01:23:16.758 --> 01:23:19.027
YEAR. SO THAT WE CAN MAN. SO

01:23:19.094 --> 01:23:21.730
AS- THE AS WERE OUT OF SESSION

01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:26.835
WE CAN LOOK AT. TAKING PROBABLY

01:23:26.901 --> 01:23:28.870
VERY LIMITED STATE RESOURCES.

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:30.505
AND USING THEM TO LEVERAGE

01:23:30.572 --> 01:23:32.474
OTHER RESOURCES AND HOPEFULLY

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:35.043
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.643
COME IN AS A PARTNER AND HELP

01:23:35.710 --> 01:23:37.545
US TO MAKE- SOME SOME CHOICES

01:23:37.612 --> 01:23:40.849
AYE AYE. IN TERMS OF RESOURCES

01:23:40.915 --> 01:23:42.484
RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:47.856
FINISHING THE BUDGET. IN THE

01:23:47.922 --> 01:23:48.890
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE

01:23:48.957 --> 01:23:50.291
SPENDING WE'RE SPENDING LOTS OF

01:23:50.358 --> 01:23:54.229
MONEY ON A LOT OF THINGS SO WE

01:23:54.295 --> 01:23:55.397
KNOW WHEN WE YOU TALK ABOUT

01:23:55.463 --> 01:23:58.032
WILL YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT

01:23:58.099 --> 01:23:59.567
CENTER DRIVE SO WE'VE GOT TO

01:23:59.634 --> 01:24:01.436
FIGURE OUT IF WE HAVE THE WILL.

01:24:01.503 --> 01:24:03.471
TO PUT MONEY INTO HOUSING AND

01:24:03.538 --> 01:24:05.273
TO BE TWO THINGS THAT ARE

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:08.343
ACTUALLY GOING TO CHANGE THE

01:24:08.410 --> 01:24:09.110
REALITY FOR PEOPLE ON THE

01:24:09.177 --> 01:24:10.678
GROUND- WHETHER IT'S

01:24:10.745 --> 01:24:12.914
HOMELESSNESS OR PEOPLE LIVING

01:24:12.981 --> 01:24:14.716
IN SIGNIFICANTLY OVERCROWDED

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:16.551
SITUATIONS WHICH IS A SEPARATE

01:24:16.618 --> 01:24:21.389
ISSUE- SO THE QUESTION HERE IS-

01:24:21.456 --> 01:24:23.057
THIS ISN'T A PERFECT BILL THIS

01:24:23.124 --> 01:24:25.226
IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO

01:24:25.293 --> 01:24:26.661
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T GET

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:28.797
EVICTED. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T

01:24:28.863 --> 01:24:30.698
AFFORD TO PAY THE RENT AND THE

01:24:30.765 --> 01:24:32.233
REALLY GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:33.468
DATA THAT WE'VE HAD OVER THE

01:24:33.535 --> 01:24:34.602
LAST FEW MONTHS IS THAT PEOPLE

01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:35.737
HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEIR

01:24:35.804 --> 01:24:37.505
LANDLORDS AND MAKING PAYMENTS

01:24:37.572 --> 01:24:38.773
EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT PAYING THE

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:40.942
ENTIRE PAY RENT DUE AND I

01:24:41.009 --> 01:24:42.110
EXPECT THAT THAT'S GOING TO

01:24:42.177 --> 01:24:43.812
CONTINUE BECAUSE PEOPLE FEEL A

01:24:43.878 --> 01:24:45.413
REAL COMMITMENT TO MAKE SURE

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.282
THAT THEY'RE HOUSING IS SECURE.

01:24:47.348 --> 01:24:48.583
AND SO WHAT THIS DOES IS IT

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:50.385
SETS UP A FRAMEWORK FOR US TO

01:24:50.452 --> 01:24:52.554
BE ABLE TO TELL LANDLORDS AND

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:54.522
TENANTS THIS IS HOW YOUR HOW

01:24:54.589 --> 01:24:58.193
YOU'RE GOING TO- MANAGE THAT

01:24:58.259 --> 01:25:00.028
THE SITUATION AND WE DON'T WANT

01:25:00.094 --> 01:25:01.830
TO EVICTING PEOPLE AND WE WANT

01:25:01.896 --> 01:25:03.965
TENANTS TO PAY AT LEAST 25% OF

01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:04.966
THE RENT AND IF YOU'RE MAKING

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:05.700
MORE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:07.402
PAY MORE UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE

01:25:07.469 --> 01:25:09.404
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN. IMPACTED BY

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:12.407
THE CORONAVIRUS FINANCIALLY

01:25:12.474 --> 01:25:14.242
AND- AND HOPEFULLY WILL KEEP

01:25:14.309 --> 01:25:15.210
PEOPLE OUT OF COURT THAT'S THE

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:17.879
BOTTOM LINE AND IT WILL WORK

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:19.013
THE COMMITMENT IS THAT WE'RE

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.215
GOING TO STAY AT THE TABLE AND

01:25:20.281 --> 01:25:21.416
WE'LL WORK THROUGH THE THROUGH

01:25:21.483 --> 01:25:22.984
THE END FROM TO TRY TO FIGURE

01:25:23.051 --> 01:25:24.118
OUT WHAT PIECES WE CAN PUT

01:25:24.185 --> 01:25:26.120
