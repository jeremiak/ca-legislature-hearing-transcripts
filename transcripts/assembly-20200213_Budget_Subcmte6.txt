Subcommittee six. Homelessness. Really appreciate everybody for coming- we also appreciate minor Marylander breed tending to the I know she had a very tight time frame so we were going to give her the opening statement and then proceed on the hearing so memory. Well first of all- thank you assembly member taking for- not only provided me with this opportunity but also for your incredible advocacy on homelessness and housing and the work that you continue to do- to leverage resources not only first Francisco but your your understanding of the- complexities of the issue and our need. To do more on the state level you've been a great advocate and we really appreciate that- thank you to members of the committee- thank you to my assembly member David Chiu it's really great to be here and thank you also again for- hosting this- hearing here in San Francisco which has. Definitely made it more convenient. For me out by- so good morning everyone times London for the mayor of San Francisco and- as we all know we've we've seen- throughout not only San Francisco but throughout the state- homelessness is really taken front and center and has- played itself out on our streets in a way that- is something that as a- San Franciscan it as- San Francisco. And as someone seen homelessness- over the years to this magnitude not to since it. Is including an oak I know may shaft is here to test as well- it is it is like nothing I've ever seen before. In San Francisco alone we have over a thousand people experiencing homelessness on any given night and five thousand people are less. On shelter. It's every night San Francisco provide shelter and housing to over thirteen thousand people and we have more permanent supportive housing per capita than any other major city in the United States and still are citizens are suffering. In fact over the past. Years. Sit homelessness and it doesn't even look like we scratch the surface. Every day when I walked the streets of the city I witnessed the suffering even on my way here to this hearing. The families hustling from the bus stops to the shelter the young adults force to set up a tent on the sidewalk the veteran struggling to hold on to their dignity. It is really been challenging to witness and frustrating not to be able to move faster to deal with this crisis. I'm really grateful again for this committee and their leadership dedicating new state resources over the past two budget cycles. Cities and counties can not address this crisis alone we need to work in partnership with the state to allocate the funding recall. Tied on prices and I'm also grateful to the governor leadership on this issue. Twenty twenty. Twenty two. Twenty twenty one. Included unprecedented amount of state funding. As homelessness San Fran Cisco has received over twenty seven million dollars and he funding and we have invested those resources in rapid housing for transitional age you an adult and in the capital and operate a- and- versions. To help get people on the housing San Francisco will likely receive eight million dollars in a H. A. P. funding this year and we plan to use those resources to continue to expand our recent centers and it proved. Transcriptions access child. Third round of my money is appreciated would certainly go to get you over on going funding is not Terry to make a meaningful impact in the lives of people on the streets in this ongoing funding will allow the cities and counties across the state to continue the programs opened with- the both he and happy funding additionally. Funding will allow community vast in the most effective interview and that is. House without said later more rocker see an by passing cities and counties as outlined in the current proposal is counterproductive. Cities and counties are primarily response the building employs operate. Respond state resort is to calm and local and federal funding I encourage the sub committee to re commit to requiring that from the state be provided to local jurisdictions. And this will in short in use. From programs that have been six. The good must are says to mandate is the most notable which is the legal mandate to require local governments to commit resources to dramatically with homelessness in our communities and I support the goals of this mandate and I see that every. Jurisdiction has to do their part across this this state to help address this issue I also saw the need for increased accountability to ensure that our limited resources are spent effectively however. I cannot support the constitution amendment as currently proposed because then you requirements placed on local government would not come with the needed resources to actually implement them- so. That's my two cents I wanna again thank you all so much for working with my office during this budget process- to help us address these issues- I know that this is a very challenging issue and have a lot of great players with. Great ideas and a lot of people who are working hard. To address this issue and really proud of what we've done in San Francisco but of course we need more and we're hoping that you'll continue to work with us to accomplish the goals that we all want to see and that is putting. An end to homelessness and our state thank you. Thank you thank you and we will should all. For on this issue I've ever since you've been a dish supervisors as mayor this is been one of your- top priorities and shows and everything that you've been doing in terms of your budget. And in terms of the policy work you've been doing on top of- being advocate for housing we knew it we know that that's a huge part of the equation. I know that- you don't have time for questions so I know Mister Kaczynski was here for the later part of the day I'll bet thank you but yes I mean that that's what we're taught if you wanted to. Take a question to one of my- colleagues had. Not I think not at this time it was just getting warmed up things are really really appreciate your coming by today and just kicking off our hearing thank you gray and thank you so much for the opportunity and thank you to everyone here today I to help us address this issue- we gotta get started we got to move faster. You can change in an- for to help us do that again thank you. A so that we're gonna continue with our hearing- again we are having a overview of the state homelessness funding in the governor's budget proposal on how this- we know that at this point in our state we have. A homelessness crisis- with over a hundred and fifty one thousand Californians who are on our street- we have about nine thousand and- plus homeless individuals in San Francisco. LA que just finish the this not. John San Francisco or Los Angeles or from I'm really appreciate I called again for being here from Bakersfield this is an issue that. Into the Senate the only issue that really. Huge number of home. All up in the- all the leadership that we able to work with governor brown as well governor knew some of the state over the last two years has specifically done. One point one billion dollars of funding to. Focus on homelessness that was. Counties que the continuum of care which is a variety of nonprofit networks it in counties who really have been fighting and what on this issue of homelessness for the last few decades we know that we need to do more- but just to put this in context is a huge jump from really where the state used to do. The state we have not. Hey did in housing or hopelessness. It up till the last few. Really the state have abdicated their ability the main the funding for housing was our low income housing tax credit. He had. All all fired a few years ago. Even that funding to make sure that program was further further funded as well as to it for that we now are finding the area of homelessness. Yeah and- I've had the doctor of really working years ago really working with our- mers to bring this. To for we know that. Many others are as my mayor talked about the all the mayors they feel like they're really at ground zero of this issue. Any exit don't those types of resort. Today as part our hearing we have represent from the ministry Papa the new proposal we also have representatives we have. Three three of the big city mayors well as represent us in LA county and also- really a- professor from UCSF more. Senator from whatever is on the cutting edge of homelessness but but today we wanted to make sure that this hearing was held in San Francisco in the bay area where we have really felt the crux of this issue for some years- now that it's really gotten to be done. Across the state. The state now decided to call partner in working to eradicate business in California. We we're proud to have the world's fifth largest. The same time we want people living in poverty those that's one in five way too many at the same time that the economy is booming for some we have so many families indeed it. Can't the most be. The life they can't afford to buy food can't afford to pay rent they can't afford to purchase gas for their vehicle to get to. And so we know. What are we doing make. Some of the middle class working class Californians and so again this is it this funding is a key piece of proposal really honor to have a number of my colleagues- join me today for our- open it to them. If they have a- remarks. But for those that know me as a member Vince Fong represent the such about Kern county- but certainly I want to thank a charge for the in my- in a you know when we do we talk about housing and cal you know a lot of folks will think of the- in the center valley in and rural communities yeah but we have a crisis as well and so for myself I only. Have delved into. Q. certainly will look for working with the guy. Ministry well as a- I'm not. Right away the with the system as a whole certainly a lot of the attention goes to shelters and shelter heads- but you know we did a we utilizing collecting. The at them she's will get. You know using a to my sister. Most and we do assessment of individuals on the streets but no all we are we Atty using that- because that that information is near real time as opposed to the point time can't which I participated in this year in I in my community. And certainly you know where the gaps- in are we investing in a doing enough on that's what. I'm and are we investing enough in support housing so those are the areas that I certainly want to- desk and learn from but certainly this is a this is that not only. Exists in urban centers by in the real centers as well so thank you very much. Strict fifty into a one of a begin thanking Kerr. A chair ting for always said taking opportunity to plug cut- the bear so. Go bears- our our- mutual- water. This is an extremely serious issue it's one that's been going on- in California for far too long- I personally have been- a working on homeless issues for now over twenty years and- is the mayor of Santa Monica and- for a short period of time is executive director of a homeless nonprofit- for so it's quite to. Sync up for all of us- to be here today after working on this issue for so long and seeing the numbers- a dramatically higher than they were of a few years ago but that number in southern California or even- in the state of a hundred and- fifty thousand plus. Most people who are here- the fifty eight thousand are counted in Los Angeles county and I was. Out on the streets Santa Monica- as part of the count- this year and every year since we started counting and number years ago- but that- number doesn't tell the whole story- in Los Angeles county- free is allowed to the- new. Yes P. died on the street each of the- years it's outrageous- it's outrageous particularly when we- recognize that were actually housing. Where people than ever before you would think we'd be reducing those numbers and catching up but- we're doing good. And in regard not well enough but we're doing better- but the problem that we face today. Is that more people are entering homelessness than are leaving in Los Angeles county- around a hundred and fifty three people a day. Are being housed- but a significantly higher number are entering homelessness on a daily basis and that's that delta that's creating the- the statistic where we see a right. Number of people in three will but we need to do about it we also know- what the solutions are ultimately permanent supportive housing- is the gold standard we need to build more we need to provide that housing. But we also need to do more to prevent people from entering homelessness in the first place- as rental subsidies- and other. Energy out there we need to recognize that there are. A number of factors at play and why people are- ended up home this this is not just one. One thing their social factors like of dental health issue that are up the priest. Up close the biggest have. Dress the a we have a napa. Of math this. With no really good solutions that are taking a number of lives and destroying lives on a daily basis- throughout throughout the state so I'm really anxious to hear from the administration understand better- the governor's proposal- I have for us some thoughts on that but all reserve the- for later. Thank you. Morning I'm David Chiu N. as the assembly member representing the district were in I want to welcome all of you to San Francisco to our colleagues- and to all of you in the audience that represent. Some of the- in community of leaders and advocates around the bay area around the state. That are clean the moral question of today just. The what the state and the wealthiest country in the world. House the suffering that we are seen on our streets with over a hundred and fifty thousand. Californians re night. Who do not have access to shelter- the double digit increases were seen in every major city in recent years- the fact of the matter is- this is. A crisis from. The northern. Hepatitis outbreaks in the homeless population in San Diego homeless encampments in suburban county skip pro in Los Angeles in California you have farmworkers sleeping on the field in our call. One out of ten Ste. Who are effectively homeless sleeping in their cars on a friend's couch taking showers in the gym and of course the suffering that we are seen here in San Francisco and the bay area within a few blocks of where we are. As the of the too many also is a member. They want to. Our future thanks for convening this and let me best. I'm gonna ask the th question that are on that's on my mind right now and if the extent to which various panels might be able to answer parts of them- I would appreciate that for me is the chair of the housing committee- really three things we are focused on. First what are the specific and crew right solutions for addressing the challenges your seats streets we know there's a diversity reasons why. Individuals become homeless and what are the eight- hue. And sufficient and effective ways for us to address the suffering was seen our streets. Sec this had we. The very first bill I introduced this year. A proposed first time that. Right than it in. Recent time for homeless the we establish a source of for homelessness we are not going to be able to get out of this crisis in for the short term the medium term. And long term. My third question- for all of you is assuming we know what the right answers are assuming. We are able to find the solutions at the level that they need to be funded at. How do we ensure that we are holding our schools accountable to achieving these results were the metrics we use what are the mechanisms. Used to ensure everyone involved from the eight to count and cities all of the- various stakeholders. Nonprofit in advocacy organizations working on. How do we all hold cells accountable for ensuring that we and this is because of what the vision of this conversation needs to be. Is a day in California does not have a hundred fifty thousand people every night sleeping on the streets a day when. Homelessness no longer exists and I know we all. Hope that we can achieve that and that is why we hear so with that again appreciate the conversation and look forward to it. Mister chair. Thank you very much. We will start with. Away as well as departmental service we have. Lower does moralis from only if you could please come up as well as Chen Troyer from. Department of social services. And we can start with L. thank you. Good morning. I'm Lucas moralis with the legislative analyst's office I've been asked by the committee to provide background on the state's homelessness- challenges and provide an update on major recent state actions. Seven asked to provide an update. On. On the state of homes in California and how the state has responded in recent years so I will from this hand before you know believe there's extra copies for the audience as well. If you'll turn to the first page. This really is a lot of the comments that may aid in other opening remarks. While homelessness is a very complex problem that has many causes we see that the high cost of housing in the state is a significant contributor if you look at figure one on the first page you see that Californians spend more. Of their income on housing at every income quartile and this is a more income across. As a comparison to how folks spend their income across the state and to the rising cost of housing. Has exceeded the increase in wages particularly for a low income households that's a lot of stress- particularly for the one point five. More than half of their income towards rent and so for these populations. A job loss or an unexpected expense could result in homelessness. The turning to the second page. We see that a mid at these high cost high cost of housing that we see in the state of California has over one hundred and fifty one thousand people experiencing homelessness. This is more people than any other state of the nation the figure on page two lays out some of the characteristics of the state's unless population. At some of the when the highlight who are that the state's almost by increased by about 16% between two thousand eighteen and thousand nineteen. 72% of the state's homeless population is on sheltered overall 27% of the homeless population is chronically on sheltered. This information is based on the twenty nineteen point in time found. Out while the twenty twenty point in time count has taken place those results are not just yet of it well from the federal government. If you'll turn to the third page of the handout you'll see a image that depicts how the homeless population is spread across the state. As was mentioned already there's a great concentration of hopelessness in the greater LA region. Overall we see that about two thirds of the state's homeless population are spread with in the seven it continues of care that are identified in the map. The remainder so the one third of the homeless population reside among the other thirty seven CEO sees. It's also likely that these numbers aren't under account- we know that efforts to produce an accurate in concur and complete count are hindered by a number of factors. Including the transitory nature of the homeless population that makes them inherently difficult to count. As well as other limitations as was mentioned. Individuals that are couch surfing or families that live in overcrowded housing are just not to mention that our is difficult are are easy to be sure in the point in time county. Represent an important dimension of the state's home with. This crisis. So have you provided the con. For the breath of homelessness in California I'll transition to discussing efforts to address homelessness turn to page four. Starting out as a higher more conceptual level we see that there's sort of two main buckets. The first approach are mechanisms that lasts but may offer only temporary solutions the for example things like shelter that are generally ease- more cost effective have lower barriers of entry and get them up and running more quickly. The downside to this is that you're not the read is that and folks lean back into homelessness. Then we also see other strategies that while they cost more it may have more long term benefits for example permanent supportive housing which was discussed in the opening comment. To be out more permanent of the red. You see. Need more cost and a longer time to get these types of services up and running. Turning to the fifth page of the handout. Sir to get into more specifics about what the state has historically done to address homelessness. So we see that California in partnership with the federal government has a struggle administered a number of programs that help address- the needs of individuals experiencing homelessness here we see sort of the very first type of programs are those that help building new. Affordably priced housing primarily been through things like tax credits that provide tax breaks to developers without another exchange for that you see them reserving units for lower individuals. You also see types of programs that help individuals of for housing these are things like vouchers that provide payments directly to landlords and make units more affordable for. Individuals and the last grounds are health and Human Services. Well these programs may not a- provide health benefits the provide other types of. That build help develop self sufficiency in that way might help people prevent or come out of homelessness. In the middle of page fire that there's a number of state department that had been involved in administering these types of service some of the key ones are- are each deal at the state and the council that was established in recent years. But then you'll see a number of other departments GFS as well as cal that have their their own homelessness programs. Funding for these programs come from for a variety of different mechanisms and we said we've seen that over the years the amount of funding available for these programs as varied we've seen. Even more recently that there's been significant one time augmentations. What about the- of way in which the state has historically been involved if you'll turn to state. To page six we talk about the local level response we've seen that while the state has provided funding it's really at the local level where- services are provided. Relying in part on the state and federal sources. And local governments are most knowledgeable about the specific needs of the homeless populations in their communities. And making decisions about what is the right mix of approaches make sense for them. As in recognition of this we've seen quite a bit of flexibility given to local governments and exercising how these programs are used- we highlighted the middle the page a few examples. Of funding sources that either a state- sources that provide a lot of flexibility or measures that local governments have taken upon themselves to identify new sources. To dedicate towards homelessness response and we- government. The state thing I. Was in a housing or rent stabilization efforts that can bring relief to the space. So in summary here that the key is. The local response has really been driven by locals own decisions about the challenges they are facing and what makes sense to help. Us homelessness in their own communities. So what I just presented has been sort of the historical nature of the state and local response. But if you'll turn to page seven we'll see that in recent years that dynamic has become has evolved and we've seen the state take a more active role in helping locals. Support the homeless needs within their own communities the chart on page seven highlights some of the major state actions in recent years. The state has generally taken a year by year approach in considering and authorizing new funding sources. Towards helping address hopelessness. All these major actions have authorized over three billion dollars towards homelessness. And whether these funds have been of authorized by the voters in the place of no place like. Are on. The legislature and the governor through the project budget process. To that each of these programs has their own set of parameters that identify the eligible uses of the funding. Identify requirements set methodologies for allocation and establish their own oversight mechanisms. So all of. Them are relatively new. The first until the end to which we can to about. What has been achieved it has some limitations but over the next few pages I'll talk about each of these three interns are the highlight some of the key features what we know today about how the programs are working. On page eight we turn to no place like home. Which was established by the legislature but then authorized by voters this part of proposition two and a twenty eighteen. This program is specifically targeted towards new construction you have been or rehabilitation of existing housing. Individuals experiencing the ana so he see interest and target specific type of homeless population. A lot of this in has already come out there's more money that it's expected to be dispersed over. The next two years- but we have heard of that at least the funding that was available or made available through the twenty nineteen twenty budget years estimated to build between thirteen hundred and eight hundred additional units on the seas are permanent supportive housing units. On page nine we turn to the homeless emergency aid program heap. This was a new program that was established is part of. Twenty eighteen twenty nineteen budget cycle it's administered under the homelessness coordinating and finance council allocated on a one time basis five hundred million dollars in grants to local governments of these are cities and continuum of care you provide a quite a bit of flexibility on how these. Funds were you. Sort of the bottom of page. Some of the ways in which local governments using the funding. By services to make capital improvements make a provide assistance and as well as help homeless you. What we see in this program that homeless youth was one of the particular out populations of interest and there is a requirement that to use these funds local jurisdictions designate- emergency shelter crisis. So then these are ways in which the programs have been shaped to provide and support very specific. Purposes there is. To page eleven we have the homelessness housing assistance and prevention program. This was just authorizes part of the nineteen twenty budget cycle and here again we see sort of funding from the state going on a one time basis this time six hundred and fifty million dollars towards local government whereas he paid funding to cities and going to care you see this program. Communities working cult to address this is within their communities as a condition of getting some of these funds. Seen third less progress a lot of in his yet to be released- for all these programs we see that there's reporting higher men's that require recipients provide updates on how it's going for the heat program the first annual report was just do in January and we understand the administration. Are reviewing those reports a better sense of. A how can how local governments are using the funds and to what effect. On page twelve of the out we just mentioned that. There's been an expansion of the state's involvement in the state portion of the low income housing tax credit five hundred million dollars authorized as part of the nineteen twelve. It's to the final note make here that. This edition of the recent action. To help support locals it's really been up to the local level where a lot of the services are provided and there's been a lot of discretion in these local governments providing sources in a way that makes sense for them. And so soared up on the Avenue on the final page of the handout on page thirteen we just highlight some key local government efforts. To provide services in their jurisdiction we see a- making their own policy discussions we highlight here Los Angeles county the stop the final of a flexible funding pull. That brings together funding from a variety of sources to provide rental assistance and other services to those individuals that are experiencing homelessness in their community. And we see jurisdictions popping. Their own ballot measures to authorize additional funding toward this is a we see not en Los Angeles city and county as well as Senate. In Alameda county. To give you a flavor of not for this. The state but the also the way in which state and local interacted I'm happy to take any questions that you. Great before we take questions just wanna highlighted for people who are interested in actually obtaining the- legislative analyst's report you can find on their website eight. Google legislative analyst's office for a few Google the- we are committed all on our website. But with that the committee any questions for illegal. This is for. I'm just a few quick questions- in terms of the undercount at the accuracy of the numbers Sir Alan's for us especially. Since we're providing oversight it and how do we properly yes the effect. Are you can example are part time count twenty nineteen was hundred individuals who are homeless though- are a to my system we that we currently have where individuals who are says on the street. But through. The programs and- provide services we probably have three thousand individuals in our database- so that's- and so when we do these point counts and the numbers continue to increase because of Harper more volunteers. Whatever the reasons are. It may be that there isn't more homeless stages we didn't count them at the first time or order were under counting as you in a bit. So what is what would you what are your thoughts on that should we be. Utilizing other data sources should we be continuously counting instead of relying on the points I'm can I do know that had requires that but I like to know your your perspective on that. So have a clear. But the- characteristics answer this and the do not only number but the character. There is of the most popular in any community is important to understand what are the right types of services mix of services to serve the population effectively. The point in time counts to provide a useful estimate- as we as we mentioned that there are so the limitations of that to the extent that other data sources can be used. To provide comprehensive picture that'll just help make more informed. Is an- decisions allocate to the we would think you would agree that some point we probably should utilize utilize day says the value at. Working search image like for example they to my system I'm- on be biased here but should we be. Allow it should we should the state be collecting that data aggregating it. Does add a plea assess whether we- rooms where of funding are actually reducing homelessness yeah we've seen in the keeping have program that there are- requirements for responding to provide internet metrics on how those funds are being used in for any state program we would say that expect oversight is important to ensure that those dollars are being used assembly. And in my- the rams are utilized in terms of housing- in terms of like investment in a mental health services or or or medical detox or sabes prevention- are we making the proper investments and that should we be. I cal reimburse- those services. Rose in the medical community what are your thoughts on that. So home is a very complex problem into the there's no right approach one of the things that we've talked about is thinking about. What response of the state. Event plate. The state and local local governments and can be purchased and are just one way in which and gather permission to start making those decisions. What is the state role what do those programs look like are there priority prop populations that you'd want to invest some specific attention to. Us those are some things you want to. Thank you very much. That. We also just a lot of issues that you mentioned as a matter of fact and medi cal. In spite deep. Question answers so that's that are the part of other such yours so. The question. Let up the street from the promise of services. Good morning Mister chair and members- I will not spend time repeating the information we've already heard about the emergency with respect to homelessness I think it's very apparent to all of us- so I do we take the opportunity to talk about the governor's budget proposals for this- within that context- I'm I'm January eighth the governor. And order that built upon the prior efforts you were just hearing about- to set forth a comprehensive state response to homelessness the order expedited the availability of state assets in order to help with those solutions it's stood up a state this response team. Establish the new California access to housing and services fund. Shortly afterward on January to the governor released his budget proposal. The budget proposes to invite seven hundred and fifty million dollars in general fund to that new finder that I just mentioned and that's going to be the main subject of my comments. But I. Mentioned that there were six hundred and ninety five million in total funds proposed for the medic how much. Your California all initiative which will address some of the- issues that Mr Fong just raising. Here is for the state to lead with resources and technical assistance but to still acknowledge as we always have that local governments and the partners their- play a critical role in solutions. At the local level for all of our communities. As the minister of the state safety net programs and several targeted has been support and client assistance programs we believe CDSS as well positioned to carry out responsibility for administering this new access. Thing and services act and fund. Our goal is to develop mechanisms as quickly as we can so that if and as soon as a lead teacher approved the proposal we can get the funds out the door. We're working toward this goal collaboratively with other state and local nurse some of whom are here today- and with advocates and experts and we really look forward to working with you on the details throughout the legislative process. Hopefully for- early action by the legislature. So we need- in addition to the seven hundred fifty million dollars in general fund I just one mentioned I also want to be clear that the fund is intended to be able to receive contributions from federal local and private sources to augment the total resources that will be available. The resource to be used for our purposes first AB to develop additional affordable housing and work on the supply side. Second to provide such. Facing homelessness and tendency support services along with that rental sub. And third to help stabilize boarding care homes which I think Mister and you've already reference today- for individuals who require that kind of care. All of the individuals and families Sir by the program will be homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness. And when his broader approach in recent years to housing and homelessness issues the services and supports will all be offered a housing first model. The intent to bring the housing separate three funds to. Services so we're improving long term outcomes in supporting individuals to not only get and obtain housing but to remain how honest. Structurally the governor's proposal is for the resources from the fund to be distributed to regional administrators. Experience and established partnerships locally with that remark I've described the regional administrators need to collaborate locally to prioritize among the needs of their regions the work of those administrators will be subject to attack on administrative costs to ensure that the overall funds are achieving their intended purpose. We believe critical to be innovative in our approaches to solving the problems of homelessness and the cost rate in California. The regional approach in this the proposal is intended to incentivize that collaboration. And to ensure that we're tackling these challenges within broader geographic areas that are connected to each other in terms of their need. And that residents move between. We also believe a regional approach will bring a companies a scale and allow for us to streamline key processes that we can get the funding out the door faster. Some local jurisdictions have already employed model similar to some of what is. Included in the proposal from the governor. For distributing this funding and will benefit from what they've learned as we work to and acted on a statewide level. Together our goal is to reduce St based homelessness and to increase the stability of housing for Californians. Across the state so. Overview I am also happy to take your questions. Thank you I thank both of you for your good press shins and let me start by thanking administration for putting for the proposal that does have can monies for another one time investment this year I will say I'm not. A super. To I think we the question whether that a- about obvious is a question that we will have during the budget process- I wanted to. Know a little bit about who should be sort of leading the strategy. I wanted just note in the LA- report came out a few days ago. Our while the report plotted the fact that we are going to be increasing- a greater state wrong and the soonest- it suggested that even with this plan there still of a lack of a cohesive approach to homelessness. At his a bit of a fright. Approach homelessness and- I know. Speaking to a lot of stakeholders around the state when you have the he program focused on monies cities and continues of care when you have help money's gonna local governments and- accountability how does all this mash and so I'd love to hear from both of you. Your thoughts on who should be leading this effort how do we how do we create accountability we have so many different actor stat we are. To some degree empowering- but it does feel pretty fragmented and not a cohesive. I'm so I think it's important to recognize that it takes all of us that all of the partners at the state level and the local level bring different things to the table that are necessary to confront the challenge. Internet through the state. And it's true locally so we've been working very closely with our partners who operate some of those other programs. In the development of the trip bill language that we've proposed. I'm to you and we also do operate some. Graham's apartment already- so some of that fragmentation already exists- it's also important to acknowledge that. Also comes along the medi cal healthier California for all peace and so to some extent there's a lot that's happening in the housing and I think Human Services space in order to integrate the services are so that. Thing and- being housed I'm a where we have it but it is the case that we are all going to need to be at the table to other locally I would say the same- are our vision is that the regional administrators will be entities that already have those partner. Be. If they are not a local government themselves then they certainly will need to have a history of partnering closely with. Local governments to so in some ways we are not necessarily creating something new so much. As adding another configuration of how people who are partnering together now. Can you to partner. Could you just elaborate a little bit- certainly agree with the- the hope of collaboration but- is there. Are their power seize within the trailer bill which or otherwise to really. Ensure the collaboration require accountability again from perspective are being asked to give money to different stakeholders it's just unclear if. How do we ensure that what we are hoping to get on actually gets done yes appreciate that. I'm up front there is language in the trailer bill that provides- criteria that the regional administrators need to meet in order to qualify for the funding and that includes a demonstrated history of partnership- and X. specific set of experiences in the housing home the space- so. So that is one sort of layer of demonstrated partnership. Also requirement in the trailer bill for them to coordinate with with local partners to identify what is already happening and where there may be gaps so that can be blending and rating existing funding and efforts- and so that is where it would be part of the plan that they would be bringing back to the department so we will be. Reviewing and ensuring that they assessed. What is already happening with their partners with existing funding streams and that this is helping to blend braid and bridge the gaps- we also then will. Performance based contracts in those. Ability measures- which were in the process of to create right now I'm and those also will reflect whether or not they are succeeding in back collaboration. And advocacy Elio if you have any comments on this obvious in your report you suggest there's a bit of a lack of medicine fragmentation. And somehow we address that in I guess related to this is sort who should be leading these efforts I know for example we created the homeless coordinating council a couple years ago. They're supposed to court they have a small staff they don't have an executive director. Even help funds. Just wondering who should be driving lesson and what are the first steps that. Whoever is driving the should focus on. Recommend the legislature should to think through as it develops its own strategic plan as we recommend in our report. You know as you there's there is you know that. Shin and different up as the from establish a new MacInnes of delay serve to look within the department of services. So we think that you consider the right approach you continue to leverage the existing mechanisms as a way of delivering services well you have time to think through convene individuals through the mechanisms like today. A and then make decisions about what is the right state role considering what are your your goals and priorities and making sure that you have solution. With but it is difficult task and one that we don't have a ready made solution. Which is why we think that sort of take the time to. Make think the those decisions and- years sometimes existing mechanism provide. In the near term leave to local governments is important. And in the long term providing that strategy. For how to set this. It's making me productions. Address the homelessness process. In the long run. Thank you. Thanks thank you I think you very much for the prison so I think it's law that guy has set up up for to of this proposal for three quarters of a billion. My overriding a can. Is that it's one time and that the I'm is in so. Up with the that there's real no amount that would be serve. Today however. I think we need to do deep and find more a resource. Excuse me. A and to that are on in nature and- the other I that I ask you address is but there's really a I think you talked a lot bit about but there's a lack of specificity in the right now and I think if I understand a correct we're out allege. To appropriate this money now with the understand figure out later with space is and that is. Really not something as the chairman of her put up in a member this can that. AJ does not work me so how would you propose that we align ourselves a- providing. The visitor of. In the but process so we know we approve the by so in June we know what we're gonna. And then I have some specific on how the governor said the image is so proposed to al. Thank I'm so with your to your for point on on research Hey I certain your not the only one that I've heard already at the morning meant that an I think they the sort of I'm going. I goal for the state in it find those on resources with the Kern economy and to the I'm sure of what those resources are gonna be going for so the per this. Winter we went to funding but it does allow for invest and in addition to the resources they mention earlier from from so including per. And I think that that I. Is that is that it cap. For that as we- and then it. Wait how. The some king we have an on going out to evaluate is work as we continue to move and for I do think the problem will be so. Within the- year or a couple of the said this is going to be an on going even though despite resources are when time in the and with respect to the of space. We really look working with you and your Ste to try to down. The particular are you would like to be clear about it we've had. Any and- calm some of those my detail come. To it is that we- vita what we hope is in France. I'm a for a program that were from to and I'd post for the most could piece but we certainly well additional input. You know they are to have a calm about any just. Brown yes aren't kids that the for is a stands today does per a bit of discrepancy department of social service and our CASF and what are we that you know since about the number of region's the with government raising the as the funds are one that sort of merit you gosh over the coming extended the pledge. Thirty is was are things that can be. Into the old land. And establish the program. Action the legislature would want to go into the to the beyond that sort of bigger picture. Those are six similar press that have been set on of approach the stay has is to delegate revenue. At two local got to their home and serve to this is that there are certain areas of the law. You could continue to use this model that we place today to delay those things are. Priorities the you let me into the specific at least as stand kind of book that the administration of. Oppose it when I first the a proposed I re that of the purchase of foot motor. Properties we be. One of the priorities to at I think you I it as affordable how per. And. Eight would like to know Sir of where the admit is on the specific right now. So with for to the of housing development they is a difference in the trailer bill and I was just look for that's fine although sage. Which is to the to being of the re use of for are possible and that made things some of what you are top about. So I think there's an op both with for to property but all. To men to take in every using exist. Number for. Our for. Affordable and I is a said that continue to be. Arm and anticipate use. He said ugh sometimes nexus of stern fifty thousand dollars in called. Do. It's extremely important that we do that but- please to post now it's not gonna go very far that's how we allocate it. That point that there is also a reference in the trailer bill to the fact that- uses. And where we would be establishing a dollar threshold to ensure that the funds are not over Rendon subsumed by only that use because we want a balance between the uses that are proposed. Thank you a not- use the funds was the for a board and care- as I think we both took a disk. It's an important issue- that needs to be addressed. Do you have a- CERN. And that is the board care crisis- is. One of our- it is it it's broader than- just homelessness in of affecting- a seniors so of the disabled- on other categories of individuals- who are not necessarily. I threatened with homeless. It's a- this that. I'm not so sure the so in to the boarding the cry autumn. Inside of this particular fund it probably have its own discrete funding source. I have just one on this issue so and as I've already spoken about it today- I don't want to diminish the importance of it and take away funding from. Up providing solutions but I think there it may be back up some separation. I don't know if you have any comments on that but it. I think something we should be thinking about sure well we are- department social services we are also the licensing entity for our facility which three. It was a- mental facilities in a and residential facility for the elderly- and that capacity we are licensing division does work- quite a bit the licensees who are experiencing challenges in keeping their doors open technical system passed city already- so some of that work is happening and we're happy to collaborate with you. To try to get what we've I'm not ext. How to gap and with respect to this specific uses from the fund the idea is that. It may be for example an operating subsidy or of a rental subsidy- but it is intended to be targeted to the facilities that are serving this population so there is sort of a larger category of the burden care facilities. And there is a subset of them that specific service population so that's the focus for the specific use of the fine but again happy to work with you on all fronts. And I think chair of the larger. It's hard to mean interrupt you but- therein lies the problem before only addressing that subset. Of risk for. Of a much broader crisis that needs to be addressed. The third tab- a bucket of money I or up to of this money was used. Since some. I think. Xin aspect of how is something that we haven't done enough of- and to of the more people we keep from entering homelessness the of clearly the better off we and it's a much much more. You very limited reap in. The at least in some of the increase the dramatic increase that we're seeing in homelessness is largely due to people who are newly entering says because they have. Issue with their ability to make that law the rent payment- things of that nature- so I want. To more focus on. On that particular expected. Which for. Answers to questions. Thank you. For I just a few questions I but I certainly want- a day I appreciate the governor coming to Bakersfield a few months back and we only had a conversation of about a number. In terms of it I just to piggy back on. He blames question we did have a come in about stable funding is there is there and discussions and imitation about looking at a five year plan to try to as as LA outlined maybe putting together- a more coordinated effort and funding that so that their stability for the providers- if your- goal is. See you. Lies yeah. Aboard if it's to be more- housing. What housing on online that can't be done in in one year is there a conversation to do that as I mean actually deferred to- alley who I think it's gonna be a expand. AB council believe please being some did you do planning that you can prop speak to okay when she's here you did highlight- that you were developing simple space measures- within can can you. Shed some light on what was will look like a- Hey is it still be a teasing that out in a you know yeah cat let us know what it is or are you a it was a more information yeah absolutely wheelchair it I don't I'm not prepared here today to sort of provide the- lines of what specifically it is but we have been looking at the other programs that already. This the data that's- as you mentioned in my and also outside of a time I. S. it. Came with reporters what is. Cooley and trying to sort of. Pull all of that together into what could be a meaningful way to measure success. So we will absolutely share more of that information so there's a conversation using HMIS and other data points the terms of the term. Before their- which is. I am we want to rely the edge of my data Sanders we don't wanna. The will or we don't need to but we also recognize that not everything that we are going to want and need to collect information about a already be captured. Okay and my last question in terms of and they certainly. There are or realities that are different in terms of urban homelessness and rule homelessness it certainly in the real committees transportations in is an issue- more more spread out- at. Is there recognition within the governor's proposal of about the- ensuring that the rule committees also. Receive adequate funding this is certainly I will concede the point that a said as a- as- a portion and we've not most of homelessness is it. Open centers but- a how do you how do you how do you. Yeah that would it would save is that the trailer bill outlines- factors for the allocation of the funding. They in the pick county of homelessness but they are doing digital housing needs assessment. And in the to the right burden- that individual are facing a community so it's it is an attempt to sort of comprehensively look at the factors that are leading to the cost crisis. And to homelessness across the state okay and one last question and in terms of the governor's proposal to expand Medicaid al- to include and booze preventive health care can you expand on a what it wouldn't. Include the taxes include a metal services counseling services abuse Iggy is out on the table so I'm afraid I have to defer to probably three nine year and within the department of health care services to talk more about it I think that that in broad strokes. The point is to integrate eight physical. Health services for individuals with needs and- cost. Jackie what that's going to look at I know they going. Subcommittee hearing next we and I believe that's right. Will be there for that. I hope they will be a to share more with you about that. Thank you I also had a- few questions as well- just wanted to get into the- issue regarding why the department was chosen. To leave this effort could you describe to me what efforts on the department handles in terms of affordable housing development. But we don't currently have programs that that- focused on the housing development per se what we have our housing and homelessness programs that targets but take populations- and matching them to have it and so they- need to work at the local level we- I'm- there's and with other providers of affordable housing but we- the part. Appropriate five I'm a we're going to be partnering with others within the state who do you have that experience- and we already have been in the development trailer and will be on an ongoing basis. Notation to specifically the department the working with. I know I don't believe that specified in the in in terms. Into support services could you describe the specific program in the amount of fun and you given the service right now we have. A specific amount and part of the idea of me just current for our miss I know you do hello I'm sorry funding for the works you do other areas if you can walk to us the amount of money. I mean ask to join us it works on our help. Branch to the- that we- operate probably even better than I can. More so in the V. Graham that we oversee at CDSS we have the cal works how support program that's a ninety five million dollar annual program to rapid re housing program for homeless cal work please we also have the cal works homes assistance. Sixty million or so are you am. Our some and assist with sort providing- hotel there's other see shelter as well as assistance with obtaining- of housing I terms of last month's rent deposit but center. We also have the bringing home program. That's a two five dollars. Available over three years that's for homeless child welfare involve families I we have the housing a disability advocacy program that is targeting sort of the chronically homeless it's provides housing supports and also assist that population with- getting on to some benefit programs like SS I it struck. That's a twenty five million dollar- annual appropriation I and then we also have the home safe program is for senior years that are housing and stable and- involved with the adult protective services system that's fifteen million dollars. Available or three years. All we are one time it depends the so pro is on an annual basis as is the cal works almost assistance program- bring families almost three years- the home state programs three years- in the housing disability advocacy program is annual so it's sort of a court room. Great armed. So given that and given that this is. Only one time funding are how how would you do. Designs a program around one time funding for tennis supporter services and completed financial services I'm so is so what we would be doing is releasing an RFP to the regional administrators would apply a we will grant the funding- allocated across the region advance two eight one regional administrator per region and will be identifying based. That I described and the specific server they think are most needed locally so an example of tendency support services might be legal services- they might be mediation between the land more than Ste our housing navigation service those things were in. Talk about tennis service. In regional ministers not individuals within DSS you to Xin them as being- government agencies or correct the only the only exclusion in the trailer bill is of the be private for profit and to. But the be exit. Local government you consortiums of local government entities are could be non profits. I didn't can can you walk us through the twenty for which minister. It also might my collar was that we can you just the three. Mission of the region's yeah we not yet provided the break down of the regions that we propose we- have drafted something that's working its way through the administration and that we will share with you soon- in order to identify those regions we- are looking. Governance structures. I'm in. So I measures need. And trying identify the group that feel the most appropriate based on all of that and then we will share that with you- at the allocations are specifically broken out as a- and earlier- in the trailer bill the factors are laid out so that's the pic. That's the regional housing needs assessment- and- ting. Right burden for fan so I'm trying and the specific pieces my trailer bill- about regional administrators what I mentioned earlier in broad. Strokes with the need to have a history all go out. To have a history of- understanding how supply. In the region- they need to have a demonstrated history of local partnerships- that position them well on and we need to be able to demonstrate why they can operate across the region. In is in is there a reason why this is a- you're pretty significant archer from the infrastructure that's already in place around. Homelessness the team is of care which is an existing for deck zero reason for that departure I'm the reason the departure is that we are trying to approach is on a regional basis and so there is no entity at this point that would cut across the regions in the way that we are looking for having said that I entirely possible that a continuum of care or consortium of them may be an applicant to be a regional administrator so how far we are departing- or not it depends in part what entities come forward and are. The con performance space. In the previous two years there is a certain structure around the funding for homelessness- did this would stop that funding to county cities CEO sees and then start to non funding is there a- why that is in terms of- that. That's significant a departure for the previous two years I'm again we are attempting to innovate and to address this at a regional level- and so the structure is slightly different under this proposal and we will be collecting the data and out comes to identify how that works out. I'm we think that it it is important address it on a regional level- and we expect all of those existing partners and all of the work that they are doing and have done to be leveraged in this new configuration and for them to be fully at the table and benefiting. From the infusion of these additional resources so I really really want to emphasize that we don't feel like we are departing from lying on we want to build upon. What is already happening but was the real issue trying to address. I'm if people across regions and the degree to which all this if you look at. The chart that lord aside and in her hand out I think you see the concentrations they don't really and each county line to reach continuum of care pine. So is it that you're saying that you're finding that be to. Says moving from LA to orange in Orange LA can worker to. Tulare I guess that's I'm just understand what probably trying to solve at at I don't know the we have is data source to point for you other than Anneke and based on what we are finding in the programs that we operate is how it works but okay when it these talk about this. Because we- if you talk to all of us I think we'll three housing is originally is so makes sense that we have been to approach the construction of housing as well as the construction of. Facilities for the homeless in a regional matter where which- told me. Cities and counties more accountable I'm trying to just. I I'm I'm not quite understanding what the regional homeless issue that you're strides all for that we're giving you. Seven hundred fifty million dollars with no performance measures with- that we've seen yet the word and you know are that we are expecting to expecting to use performance based contracts that will have very specific metrics and we will absolutely they're more information. About those in metrics in you must take a action without metric without the region's. Without specificity on regional administrators so again what's the regional you're trying to solve we will be providing you with much of the information that you were just- referencing before we would have to take action so the regional break on. The allegations that we expect for those is the performance thanks are all things that were actively on it. For you I think. Sweat. What is the regional this try to. I seeing a distant I mean as you I am the how problem and that is for regional planning how is a- it was very to the way that I just that. As a state need to tack across the whole state within regions and within. Is continue there are many ways that we have. The jeep V. and we're to innovate and do it in a slightly different way but with all those same partners. At the table. This game with. Talking is really around please. With a talk about in terms a fun you identified this is an in regional how thing original almost approach I still understand what if game ticker so within the region so the regional administrator is going to be working with all those local. He'd so not all of thing is to just at a regional level going to be year. Then distributed within the region so I don't. I'm not sure if that's making sense to you. But I'm not. You know but I think of mental illness yeah sure this is from. Just a. It is a model that I guess the you're you're basing this. Is it's been done day it is. Some might not was developed regional approach. I in no really I mean part of the mà the my the in general and what LA has done with their will have subsidy was definite top of mind the nation of many of uses here so in that the model but speak. To no any other state has the scale and scope. One that we do or the G. size we do in order. Need to address it and the same where we the reader are useful in into one that question the in. Of how the fund flows nay it lot of it to the C. season the counties so in terms and city's so then with with the regional manager then distribute so with this disease apply to the regional- in. And that. It is a full. Of flow that with the money how the research flow now a this for. Was a was in place so in the immediate distribution of funds would be for the department. Digital administrators but each regional administrator would be planning locally for how they intended to then use the funds so they may be going to look. For missing maybe going to non profits they- they will go. To demonstrate to that re. A straighter that they are able to. This that are expected within the plan that that region straighter with their partners has identified as necessary for the region. So for example the biggest at home center would no longer apply. Do you see. What apply to. Share for this specific of funds. Thank you. So is. Was was there re why this. Amount to see a seems like a fair. Narrow issue you. Trying to solve but yet you're asking for seven hundred and fifty million dollars to. Work on it. I'm not sure I know what the narrow issue is what we're trying to- deal with is the affordability crisis and St based homelessness so what we're- talking about is affordable housing developments. Out until subsidies tendencies. Sir is- and I think I've heard the question raised several times by others as to whether or not this is enough. Money given what word. I mean for of that issue yes but you do. You didn't ask for money for a of your a programs in terms of our other things which are in existence. You you didn't ask for money for low income housing. Tax credits you. Two gift to give money to a name region's two unnamed administrators. For name things and you would like approval for that so. Difficult I mean. It's A. B. the hard to prove dollars that room well that's a little easier to. Do that a hundred and fifty nine dollars I am your desire recess we aye aye I hear you. At okay will like we're gonna have a hearings arm go forward to a it. More push. What message of. I think our chairs serve made the point Michael me just for my purse I'm to of white approaches by the number commerce that I've with with other ledge. Who will be part of potentially this about lack of specific is that I don't think can underscored a knife and I think the channel and allow three jurisdiction around cal have been a bit with first by- what went for with heap and then switch it up for happened now switch it up for the third time. So understanding why we keeps it up. Understanding where the accountability is going to be. Calm I do think the case still needs to be made a why were creating another level of bureaucracy. Of a regional ministration when we could simply ask say for example the mayors who are here- you know are you using these monies well. As opposed to again creating another level of bureaucracy- the particular for the legislature we just don't. Certainly see what was in the outcomes were looking for our and obviously we ought even know what the geographically. Are so. Lots of questions to be answered- particularly since you're asking for early approval- which I know the LA- has counseled us not to do. So you know again from I'm in an open mind but these are all the questions that I think you're going to have to answer for. A hundred twenty Boston and obviously the only for represented here today. Thank you I would also not which are meant to burn off with I do really appreciate the fact that- even though wasn't completely fleshed out the ministration bringing this forward this proposal forward and in January rather than in may- I know oftentimes we could have seen this in. The end and having a much more difficult conversations I really do. Appreciate that I think what what we are looking for is just greater. Understanding for. The problem the specific issue your trying to solve we have a number of existing programs that we will. Find in to solve the greater issue that we all agree is. The issue at hand- but wanted to get clarity as to specifically. What is. The problem. Or trying to solve it also a if you want to illuminate where there's been shortcomings in the current scheme that's fine as to what the departure but- critical. You know. What what. Thickly to why were. What would you asking us for. You know. As as to give you a seven hundred and- fifty dollar. Check with not a lot of. Our is. So thank you we are be going on to our next panel we- very very happy to. Have number of may as well as Smith in the C. of Angeles county of say just as we as our W. six for but just to it just I all the- Hanalei. To come up by mall. Sense that really appreciate mayor Liccardo Merrit show for being here center their time so if we could maybe have them go first of questions directed at them first so that they could leave with. I would appreciate that. The bill the car. And I also and the bay area's only representative on the governor's council of regional homeless and risers Bob I wanted to respond to the specific questions I received in the time allotment you gave me which is quite short but I do hope you asked me some robust questions because I would enjoy the opportunity. To dialogue with you. I'm last what do I believe are the causes of homelessness- I would say first lanes in our mental health and drug addiction treatment systems seconds a shortage of housing. Third income inequality and fourth and most importantly because I think that for example I've not heard it mentioned yet this morning unless I missed it- systemic an institutionalized racism and I am glad that Margot c shell is on your agenda today because she can articulate it far better than I can. I also asked how have we spent our state money are keep and are happy. And in in a nut shell two years ago when we- came to Sacramento to ask for direct funding cities to address homelessness. Oakland had roughly four thousand. Homeless visuals in our city and a shelter house city of. Eight hundred and forty nine beds. And so while this is one time money- I will tell you that I have spent most of my keep and happy dollars on expanding my shelter city. So in year been able to double our shelter it is just completely unacceptable allow human beings to sleep on our streets. In the wealthiest region in the wealthiest state in the wealthiest be in the world. I'm I want say that we I think share the state's perspective that measure of success is not shelter and I've been a very outspoken advocate for the mandate to end homelessness and in way explaining why I think it is far superior to a right to shelter. But the reason that I have spent my half and keep monies primarily on expanding our shop- is because I have other sources of funding. For capital. I this is the voters of Oakland the voters of Alameda county have passed their own local bond issues for affordable housing. I've gone out and hustle. My philanthropic community. And if up with a twelve million dollars fund to prevent people from falling into homelessness eight high hi. Standard of success for us- Clint what I have lacked is operational funds- I do want you to know that. The vast majority of the new beds that we have created an Oakland do come with exit resources at Ste again our goal is not just to shelter people it is to move them from homeless to house. We have used our heat and hot monies to create safe RV parking up for it the 45% of our on shelter copulation that resides in RV's or cars can I and number again forty five percent. Of our on sheltered population is in cars an Arby's. Are we have used it to create three hundred twenty two beds in our innovative. Community mock. I'm a model that costs. Sir Jeff the cut brought costs refer half of the Butte. Navigate in Oakland we don't have the same money that San Francisco has we have to be creative. Two hundred twenty three beds in our innovative cabin communities that not only allow people to go to bed at night behind a locked door with their partners their pets and their possessions. But something that tradition. Does not offer and that is privacy. That is why we have had high demand and high acceptance rates for this form of shelter far higher interest. Than willing. To our more traditional congregate shelters. We're happy for the same rates up on. Exits. To traditional so although as high as a rap housing so. Burke what is and- shelter leader the winter to a year round shelter- as well as to add new Bextor uses shelter and we are going to in one month the opening. Families so we have your money. Twenty and wrap it this up again I to emphasize the real we have spent your money on all the very thing that the new per. And this his because we've a to find other so. For those things not because we don't value them and that's another reason that we encourage you to preserve some local flexibility- impact you know again we share the values that are behind the governor's proposal for the seven hundred and fifty million dollar fund but we would argue right now shelter is not an allowable use of the new fund. I and we would argue he like ours is meeting the service rate house. Ste in permanent part of housing in a- from homeless to how in prevent homelessness. We should be allowed to at least maintain the systems that we have put up with your past funds of an adult not allow those to fall apart and I think the governor's office would agree you've also asked whether these funds have inspired collaboration. And I would say that it has inspired some city to city collaboration- some of our interventions in Oakland have been in partnership with the cities of Berkeley and of Emeryville. In some limited. With the county but I have to be honest not as much as I would have hoped- I do again agree with the governor's. And US secretary galleys. I believe that we need more regional collaboration and coordination- but I regret to say I do not believe the creation of a regional administrator would accomplish that at least not in the way it's currently proposed on the time line that is in front of us and with the use of one time funds. Were to about a permanent ongoing source of funding that would be an entirely different com station but because that is not currently on the table I do not think it is worth the trip and it will be very. To all difference raiders if you're talking about only one time on. As far as the next step but I would like to see. Yes to come men. Of honor and secretary galley for continual. Pushing that our measure of success is not shelter it is moving people from homeless to house and it is preventing people from ever experiencing the trauma homelessness to begin with or even of housing in security so. Many in the area in part parks and sing. I'm aye no one has raised the R. word today and that is redevelopment- when I talk about you know these valiant efforts at the local level of locally approved. Bonds for. Hey in comparison to the redeveloped. From us. I also want to give a passionate support for a legal mandate to and homelessness- I know that we are continuing to clarify what that means I want to say in response to- mayor breeds bands we are not intending to give city or county. On man it's out new things this and that I know that I will be part of a happy chorus that says one time funding homelessness will not work we need an ongoing permanent source if we are really serious about ending this travesty so those are my comments I am very happy to take your questions. But we'll go with the car they will have quite from both. From great partners in this at. Homelessness in our region how to work with mayor Libby Schaaf Maryland in. All up to grateful work of your committee. And what is really emerged. I just and from the governor of the lack of years where we can now one in three point one billion dollars in. Funding to tackle homelessness through programs like at a place like home and he perhaps course. I really do want to emphasize I think governor Newsome for his leadership in making historic in. About homeless lap. Postal this year and if approach in working with critically with the mayors the thirty largest cities. Although that coalition this year I will not be speaking on behalf of that cold will be speaking together and Sacramento just weeks I'm guessing you'll hear from us then I just like to confinement marks to my own perspectives and first what you consider the city of San Jose a very active in when partner- in this battle we all face- prior the state's elimination of redevelopment agencies we spent forty million dollars a year to be more affordable housing than the other city over that. Time we- all the way the California's Court enable us to enact. Inclusionary housing eight and to protect that the right of others. To do the same. I would provide a laboratory first state pilot projects including the leasing Caltrans land. For action decisional house for the homeless including rapid bill tiny home communities. And since twenty seventeen we've of fortune every strong relationship with our county- to leverage in dollar county bond. On with. The millions of dollars a city for bloom dollars to complete to support of housing developments- along with. Since more units are under construction or in the pipeline and seventeen other projects- and- a week. Voters will keep a measure to. Seventy million dollars annually to combat homelessness and build affordable housing. I am world posing this year. And it's free on all commercial about. Of course none of this is nearly enough any our community since not even close out while we're building the permanent supportive housing and yes will need much much more of it. More flexible funding. From diesel. For folks still out on the street. And prior to the city's receipt of hip funds the city dedicated fifteen point six million dollars a year to homelessness response programs and he by basically came at a critical moment and we're able to. Leverage this eleven million dollars in such kind would happen to nearly twenty four million dollars this year and where we dedicating those dollars well three general buckets first most the funding is dedicated to getting homeless individuals. St archers rental subsidies use of converted motels creative diversion strategies- youth and adult navigation centers and bridge housing- we've just completed one of those tiny home communities is being leased up in the second committees up construction second we've invested in rooms you that will reduce human misery and improve safety of homeless residents everything from say parking to overnight warming's shelters to mobile showers and bathrooms- but finally most importantly notices. In the mail shops do we're investing. And over the last two cycles- we will have invested seven million dollars combined in prevention and we got to prevention because the whole. Two three years Asian with the county. One seven thousand. We are still staying are homeless and right. It became apparent that passes we're housing people more people are getting pushed out onto the street and so we try to pilot prevention and we leverage a lot private sector money back almost fifteen million dollars. The first- for our commitment in the counties also. In for. And what we learn is this is very active for spending about. Forty three hundred. Family and what we're finding in the flexible a- since. Ninety then one AT so for that would help. Are still housed six months later. A and so it is preventing homelessness it's also very nimble because more than three quarters those families are getting assistance within seventy two hours. Up so there's certainly an important debate about the state's next steps I really appreciate your willingness to have this discussion now and I know will continue but not surprisingly I join my colleague and- feeling quite strongly that we- as many needs behind. This is basis and we need to treat it like one and I agree Sir. With my colleague from Los Angeles as well we need I'm going in del. Crisis also not surprisingly I believe that those dollars should be directed large cities seize. S. cities or I'm sorry in the were the salute are. Permanent how or housing. Then. It is critically in. In local government as well I that one complaints come in about homelessness and what's going on in communities. They won't go to the John traders. Sure San Francisco. The cast member has a leave that one alone. It is a will take on our account but he- just late into the public you know I encourage you to impose very clear metrics- there are results oriented around performance we all have HMIS data bases we should be using them and we should be using them to but scannable. Performance and so- a finally I would urge if that was the goal here is to avoid the cost us a passing through a lot of agencies get that nice or the governor reduce. Expense and I think cities would happily take on the same percent a cap on the mystery of expand. Collectively for all citizen on Providence were administering this program is really critical given the allocation of he perhaps that's already out there we've got programs in the city centers A. recall another fourteen million dollars annually just to maintain those. The rug out will not. The alignment and we need to for. We stand to do more with you and look forward to working with you to do more. Thank is come back to my colleagues for questions. Mr Shipp. Let me first start by the two mayors along with mayor breed- I can't. A who are who are. Fighting at the forefront of a job this crisis appreciate. Striving mightily- and also appreciate just how under resource to our- a couple quick points first of all with regard to redevelopment I think you know. Two point oh bill so Jim bell had- carried version of it. Our governor- had step we understand his perspective that- that relying on the general fund for that was not a path he was what to do- and so to some degree were a bit stuck in this conversation- very much appreciate- that you support the idea of a permanent source of funding for homelessness and specifically- your support also. Our proposal to reform the mortgage interest deduction. Which will. To about a half a billion dollars when we know the need is much larger than that will take it though. The work with you on that. Questions have you done a needs assessment in your respective cities up. How much would it cost Oakland or San Jose. To and homelessness and I. Senate because I think it's a state really assistance and I think if we don't start with the end in mind. What what it costs to an homelessness how much will. Be it's hard for us to have the early come Xin of how how. How large should we consider investing. I've heard statistics anyway for example. To house every homeless person in the state and provides part of housing might cost to say twenty five billion dollars. That's just a back of the envelope commerce calculation someone is provided curious from your standpoint whether. You run those numbers for your cities. Note that I'm not looking at my notes I know this. By heart- our plan our path plan that we have conducted a very deep analysis using systems modeling on our existing homeless population. We estimate that the city of Oakland need annually on an ongoing basis a hundred and twenty three million dollars in operating funds. And then a capital experts. Roughly every five you of about two hundred and twenty million dollars. What we are spending right now- and I can't I can't pull out the state capitol number for you but I can tell you operationally worst being thirty two million dollars a year. And roughly half of that is time money. That spending on operation and I am I am very fiscally responsible and very proud that Oakland just got its highest rating in its history last week. I is it that you're response financially I think it is. Necessary moral. But we've got to fix that we are doing this right now because we believe that we as a society going. Eight a permanent ongoing funding source to end homelessness I believe that the political will is there I believe that the public will is there I believe we will do that and so we are. Using one time funds right now for on going expenses. Because of that faith that we have. Thank you. May have is met- responses after that the hearing with regard to specific numbers that tell you Michael is that we don't need a permit on going. To combat homelessness I would make the capital investments we need I that will actually get people housed. It seems to me that given the numbers that we know are out there you know we were able to house. And seven thousand nine hundred homeless issues over a period of low more than three years. With relatively scarce resources- we think we can clearly magnified impact. With a significant basement now from the state. We are asking our residents for more- we're all asking our our taxpayers to pay more to combat this were willing to be partners. Second question we're here very consistently from- localities around the state about the need for flexibility right local flexibility- and there's a tension between sort of local flexibility and accountability when that the monies that we're going to invest actually get back to us could you tell us how should we. Please and counties accountable for the good use of. You do not want us for were not able to really prescribe for good reason how you how we think you ought to use the funds- jump in on this one I you know I think- critical that. The metric in the accountability. Based on. But are we getting people how service staying house and how many homeless are still out on the street. It seems to me that is the measure that is most important to our communities and I know that's what's most important to the state I know there are a lot of ideas about how money can be better. Be used better or worse in any given community. But I think so now. I within RCA cities their different needs depending on. Rail but yes we have in each community for example the centers A. S. had. The opiate a crisis that I think we seem to make their cities but we are today that is. A grappling with a serious addiction issue and has been the case for many years- that does Chris different set of needs in terms of but treatment. As well as intervention. I think it's important how that such. Now I just have very strict standards about the comms. But I gave it. To hold us accountable comes up. I would add to that. Because I don't have the will. Twenty three million dollars a year our what we are committed to doing is. With the limited money we have always be having ratio always best. Ensure shelter in here. So you know making sure people are doing all those things and be aware are still elected officials that find it acceptable to in public say that their solution to homelessness is shipping their homeless to other. Have about holding us accountable. To arms is you cannot have as a pure outcome at there is less. Homelessness because you don't want to incentivize. We see that that is real and you you have to protect against. One five. I know if you were on the for region home adviser and- number had proposed this idea constitutional amendment of some sort that would hold both city desire and so the attack. Want to ask you back to. Read in her purse. Weeks so I think it's fair to say that the proposal that is currently published is pretty big I in so our work right now is to put some some specificity and- employee in up come. To what this mandate is because of mayor breeds of you what at that she stated today is one that is not intended and I do not leave will become part legal mandate to and homelessness it is not what is not intention certainly as a matter. Does not intention quite is to spend money that. Cree clarity about who's a- for what right now there is no clarity there are no legal responsibilities with regard to homelessness on any level of. Second it is to again create here a clear set of results that are required and definitions what success looks like. We also Sir- looking clear that this mandate include parents as well. For jurisdictions that we want to be kind of certified as- back to scene the best practices in reducing homelessness so those are some pieces of the puzzle that we are working in partnership with governor's office right now and again now is a good time for peace. What they- want so that we- there will be. Armed with a and potentially at the ballot box in November. And I am yeah I really applaud the work- Schaffner side breaking the rest the committee wrote push. Port and provocative idea. I think can be workable a lot of work. Idea over the goal line one thing I would suggest is that- if we're gonna hold cities account for outcomes and we probably want to avoid. What we know could be a lot of excitation fixation slit litigation if this one check criticized harbor for the cities and does UC's. That. If there is a safe harbor that seems to me we what a lot of the fear of litigation as well as the obviously the cost of litigation itself. Hi this and just to clarify the proposal is only a public right of action. Not private right of action public. And so only a governmental entity and I think the postal before and an in. General homelessness for the state. Of Calipari's. There will not be monetary damages available but more injunctive relief as far as who gets the axe to spend the existing funds how was funds are spent I am particularly quickly and effectively. Thank you again appreciate your comments- on this last topic I've been having many conversations with. Many DO not just on this panel but also throughout the state on how we- if ensure that we hopefully create a permits are so funny at the same time I'm all of us at level city county level attention regional level- and do it in a way that's going to move us forward so looking for to that work and- thank you for being here. Thank you both very much for here I and I can see your- it looks. Quick comment and you're welcome to of I some I'm and of. When we. I talked de issue of accountability one of things we need to stop. We are addressing. Change is the take place on the ground because this is an issue that has morphed over time. Thank back back when I was the mayor local government up dressing home assistance Sam the issue has. Since that time was for the- alrp which is can to of our how of crisis and we failed in many ways leave to keep. Up with those changes and so one of the- metric that. I think we ought to be judging ourselves on it is how we keep up with chair. That's because- he you make funding system thing on the ground changes you need to be able to address those changes and right now I think that is addressing the needs of people who are at risk for homelessness absolutely ugh stop. This because- on the street so I want to get that out thank you very much for here and year time is limited if I can come to that I think you raise a really important point and there are some kind of proposals floating. Descriptive that would have you know this percent to five the first. Housing to funding for capital and- really. Avoid walking some down the rigidly for ever we need to have a system where people are constantly evaluating what our jobs we housing housing cost balance because we know in the bay area that we've been adding jobs to this region and not produced. The same work. Kate and I wish that the def con three warning would have gone off a little sooner- it is now all we- sell. With purely economically driven homelessness. Which I think is a new nominee always present I'm seeing Chen is kind of our- not in his his head. I really want to their score that. We do have a fifty years ago we didn't have a method like we do it today the- easily availability easy availability cheap availability of. Yeah I agree in yes several aye aye. The way you pop. Allow CSE to be flattered of an- we're seeing a lot creative ideas rising out of every. Hi there is serious about this problem and we don't yet have the server but we know that this is going a. Lot of difference and- allow. A first let me say thank you for being. My mayor of a caring of a bigger schools as a low I textures might actually be intensifying. Did you play you for your leadership. Your cities you mention. Jeff your- but the house of love on this is the quickest thing is mental health and drug. Maybe I. Maybe for out a bit more and of how do you what do you see. Lucia certainly Ian into it is. We have been very we will in the add to it to help was but they that we find out of capacity and the goal obviously to deal with because what what is what what are your so I guess. From deal with that well I will start with the out. Health and drug addiction is just. The per of the county government not the C. of. And will say Francisco it both so they can talk kind of both I just want to have that copy out what I can say it we know housing first were. You cannot affect. Someone's I'm men and they are state how housing is health and so to the extent that we believe that these types of kind of medical dollars should all in. Seen as a- this but with the fat government. Yeah I would just that I think you know the complexity of homeless so I think that we're all well of it is very difficult to separate the fact and your- I bridge. Spec I'd probably be drug everyday to and- it's hard to know whether the costs of the every because we know there's a lot of positives job loss there's- medical. She's a host reasons why people break up. But it. Three to some of our studies are is it's going to take much core at I can say it is cost it's certain an affected were saying. And at you know our speech myself in help. Me shop may not agree with me on this one we do not host thanks but- I do believe. We need. Forced the way that us to be compassionate with drug users or on the street living in cabinets living in a and rivers and by that I mean. There's no way I'm going to get someone with a methamphetamine addiction to voluntary they say it's time for treatment get off the street ago when. Sample in Honolulu an operation hope it having a judge who can order. Someone who's been arrested for possession not too long since. Order them to treat and know that there is a potential a jailer two days in jail as a consequence if they don't go. I and then and then testing them for. The point is not to criminalize abuse not. Listeners I'm not a note. To in and with the Camanche system twenty us to get on the treatment. And right now we're not seeing any Bob. Willingness to do to make that happen now the methamphetamine yes is service public safety but to the- using as well as the surrounding. The for prosecutor. Hi city now to look at the- these blood of folks simply. Have no serious violent priors committing violent crimes because of long term Matheus window eyes and psychosis. So I think we have treat the- play now to get along sentences not go back to the war on drugs but rather to have a judge who has the authority to be able to tell somebody you got a- problem you got to go to treatment. Thank you and I guess. I've let me for say that that that. When welcome addition. Good addiction. Certainly a lot of Los or Joe I've I've so talk to the met them the my community and end up developing you know but you know certainly illness. When they're on the street so I needs the cause and effect is of course a very complicated situation will say that. Homeless end up in a zero. Yes citizens are paying for. I is a very the most expense promises services addiction services would you be open to the idea mental health or G. top or- perceptions of. A is double under Medicare. Some the look. In in in terms of like for example in the in the there is I've asked the governor to ask for- Brian de vote fry and did to- provide flexibility and- that that you entered. Well no it's the it's the eleventh ever how indeed to give the same of in covering service under it's just a mental. Housing Hey. I'll give all these aye it maybe the and that too in a week. I could that. Should an be spent to stably people that are fighting drug addiction and mental health because we know that that is the most effective conditions for successful treatment. I believe the cost of housing could and should be covered through Medicaid reimbursements. Yeah I agree and I also apply the governor's- initiative on that and thank you very much. Great thank you thank you thank you both for. Being here today- it really appreciate the presentation you made. Could you talk about. How how quickly you spent that first round of funding from heap- I mean just rob just just a rough terms I don't need to specific day but just. To get a sense of- on that the center for see I think that you both both had I really appreciate what I know them but we work on together. We work to make sure that we discussion that the parents are ready to once they got money they were. Ready to deploy that money. Yes in a German. Well you be passage you get to be better make sure you using it. We've I can tell you I know the deadline is I think a major twenty twenty one will can be well of in front of that I suspect. We're action on the second time young community that were usually the sponsors that construction on that money is used. And we were told that we there is application in the very first day that you're accepting the heap application- because we're anxious to start spending and we are prepared we had again raise private funds. To pop it the commute the model impact think I don't know. Part what hello. As actually are helped fund the pilots of our cabin community model. So that we were. So yeah your cabin can have much lower- positive exit rates are longer standing ones have very high- exit rates you know well over 60% the average all of that get about 55% right now positive exits in housing from the little cabins- but we were. We had already started front in some of the money waiting for our checks from the state to come out we are very. Are very impatient people. I just know that. I should also. Any trouble up some these programs money aside for operating for a couple years- so. The committees recess I two years that money obviously will get used until the Dodgers got and I. Mers are patient co. So sounds like he with the help dollars and are gonna be purpose to soon. Sounds like you already have planned for the for that money as well yes. We've already so our applet as a big city. In now is in. In in the new shelter capacity that we've added one to sustain it. To improve the flow to a- bàn three how the floor. I can. All use of second galley and the guy. It and then maintaining their much higher level of ability to get people off the streets and in this and see. But also to move them along to pay minute. Housing we also are used it for the for time so address I haven't Reyes enough I which is the incomes. Of the homelessness problem so this will be the first time that we're making. A major investment very targeted workforce program to actually. Seen the incomes. The employability. Police St. Visual yeah I know I'm- and a council Tuesday approved were ready to go fired up. Great thank you it incense the governor's current also really has a focus on regional collaboration I know shop you may. This sure a little bit more about that now the car few examples which is all understanding you know our are there other gaps from the region we know there gaps in terms housing production because we were that's as two of the three big cities here seems like everybody's fine telling Sanders. Francisco to build but when you ask each other vigils he's the bill they don't quite. You could. Not talk about some of the reason issue you know we to school collaborations and again it kind of takes that you know block by block knowledge that. Arguably only me. So for example our cabin community. Is actually bringing. This. Can't men and is meant the strategy as well and there was a huge encampment that was right Board clinic. Although mostly Emeryville side but we have. Cal that was ME gave us a part that the county actually divvied up there keep funds to the different cities- after deducting Oakland's direct allocation then they divided it by the- but- the county to stand up to cabin communities and a safe RV park that most people from the Emeryville side of the line that was right on our our border we also knew that they had a building that was formally being used as a temporary- and formally. But on Mr their part. There leasing a stop building for. At no cost that's a were funded only. It it it memory fell out and then find out in the governor was giving these FEMA trailers- just it feels like a few weeks ago the state or to. County to read I county in able to draw the. So that they provide. Provide that are actually. Helping the P. that will living those trailers so we provided the land we provided that little caught to ready the sites to actually be able to accept the trailers a big part of the services that come from the county again with the. State so that was a great example of true. That is sustainable thank. Hi yep you know back in twelve. Fifteen a nonprofit organization nay Modesto how. Are there by tripping over each other need the cash Allen offices within their own. What is result in a real. Genuine partnership between seeing county yeah this is. That's not all the cities but the city cal. Show will. Prevention county it is worth invest in will has kicked in for me and oversee results today. We do released a hundred million no Sir fight L. ability or this year we're gonna release I'm sorry I was last year to release another one this year. I in in all those extremely low income projects the counties making commits provide support services- wraps so in lockstep obviously their disagreements in this healthy to. These are. But know I don't as we should prop county. I don't doubt that there is a re to this challenge but as we go through the encampments in San Jose and we are very diligent during our vice but Datin HMIS to it determine where folks are coming from more. It candidate will house some in our can so there are. They're part of our community recognize it we gotta get. Great thank so sounds like a again. Your special. Shops example- you you look at specific examples where they're made a whole lot since. Push it that I'm any final comments okay great thank you mashup melakarta really appreciate you both being here- we were going to call. That's two panelists to take the to mayor spots so that joint and- is for. Each of the panelists to stick to about the- it frame as I think as you can see your your plenty of time to be able to cover all your points especially I ask questions of we appreciate everybody's- assistance and- to that. Can to that time for. So. Let's with miss Barclay from the city of Los Angeles. 20% may I monies might embassy homes corner at the city of Los Angeles in the office of the city administrative officer on behalf mayor Eric Garcetti thank you for the opportunity to be here today to speak about the critical need continued state homeless funding to major California cities. And also thank you for the hap grants they really have truly been flying to the city of Los Angeles and the other cities that you've heard speak today- as refer to by LA- I'm just as a reminder that the point in time count for the cat plus Angeles this our- thousand nine hundred and thirty six- homeless individuals 60% of those or thirty six thousand one hundred and sixty five in the city of LA. Twenty seven dot pattern twenty one or 75% of the city's homeless population is not shall. The city during six in the nay for cost per. With 569% of renters more than 30% of their income on rent. This lack of housing inventory and thus the lack of affordable affordability is creating that flow. Homelessness in the city. And why we size sixteen per crease in our home was county this year. I noted that he even haven't been a lifeline to the city of LA but I do want to stress that and very. To what you heard. Awhile from the makers on the panel as well I'm that prior to hear and half the city had been spending thirty nine million dollars of general fund initiate the amber. Program which provides a room housing and temporary emergency. Ramps and- annually o'donnell fund for the Los Angeles homeless services authority to provide a sense property saying winner shelter our age and administer the court need entry system which is based on a to my **** I'm and like other cities unlike other cities and such. Anderson city about. So how a robot affordable housing finance system for. Thousand units per year three hundred of which are supportive housing units. On the seeks secured an additional local financing source in November of twenty in with proposition eight JH which will allow the city to issue up to one point two and dollars and- finance. Facilities for some of hopping we anticipate the funds find up to ten thousand units- we committed the first three years leveraging each proposition HHH dollar with an additional two dollars and investment I'm and get to the question of partnership the city and the county in the housing of the of the city of. LA I have an- in a ship to enter all the can of. Programs are able are available we have a memorandum of understanding with the county has committed to provide support our to find supportive services and every unit that city from that the city for. And how close committed six thousand project based vouchers to support operating subsidies for those units. Can we anticipated gap service an operating funding for these units but we are currently working to develop- finance options to close this gap. Unfortunately even if the city had adequate resources. Construction doesn't happen overnight and he been have really been. Meeting a critical gap that the city can't can't afford very also similar to the mayor's you heard earlier. Today. One of the first cities to apply for heap finding an and we've immediately put eighty five million dollars are eighty five million dollar allocation to work to finance the a bridge home program creating fourteen hundred and fifty and housing. Was Sir because- I'm- we're also finding right rental assistance rapidly housing critical hygiene outreach services. And as of January first twenty twenty we committed 99% of our keep grant while I am fire about a 50% statement. That time. We also have plan fifty point million of our students seventeen point five million have grant- we've been there reserved for eight hundred and ninety two more interim bad in. Reyes home possibilities for all twenty three hundred and forty two beds at. Impair on some past grant be as well as with focus on. Diversion assistance pending and pending additional mayor and council action we anticipate that just like keep even though have has a longer spending sense that we anticipate will. Find it. We take our first. For these grant funds play and established a transparent process and procedures the safety. Of the funds- meet these things actually the approval process goes through an additional oversight median decision to mayor and council approval for that approval of the spending of all of these funds for heat and happy. They've allowed these funds of all are the city to build on existing partnerships. With the county Los. The county and the city and the county or joint. It Berman temp embrace. To find the operation of those with the can to fit dollars per bed print. For sixty six hundred of the bridge home bands and also financing the construction of an additional site in partnership with the VA- in your district Mister bloom- for this snow is on going. Team I and in please provide services. And half dollars exhaust and the three six hundred back has expired in twenty one in two thousand twenty one and twenty two the annual cost great all the a bridge home beds is forty one point seven million. The loss of the funding together with the guy in our minutes of housing five. Start significantly or the city's to our homeless crisis for these reasons we urge your support. To maintain says four models of heat and how to govern a new statewide find by distributing funds to cities and counties are continuum's of care. Increase find for the governor's post. The in dollars create from the general fund distribute fining according to a needs based formula with no cap on anyone's these allocation and to establish allocation similar to hot 40% to the bill the mayor's fifty five. Percent to nonprofit housing developers outside big cities again on behalf of the marijuana thank you for the opportunity speak to you today. And I look forward to addressing your question thank you for your support great thank you Mister Ramirez my county valley sure I'll be I'll be quick here. Thank you members and- the committee. To the for LA county. Some information on our efforts to combat homelessness. I just want to maybe give quickly a background on our can on what the county has been doing. Is in two thousand fifteen the county that have occurred a plan to tackle. Our board of supervisors- had a more they have a moral obligation and later in two thousand fifteen- initiate the hopes initiative in the county of Los Angeles and this initiative was basically directive to the city Cubans is to develop. I'm not a deal with this crisis. So after six months public process with stakeholders in the community- forty seven strategies were approved by the board and in. February of two thousand sixteen. I'm along with that came one hundred million dollar one time Smith. Argumentation no. Which was I think pretty bold. Cord to March I'm so. But LA que voted themselves a quarter cent sales tax and which would generate about three fifty four million dollars a year for two. We spent specifically on- combating to preventing homelessness. Along with this after the measure passed we had a goal of- assisting. Forty five thousand families and individuals- to move from listeners to permanent housing as well as an apple thirty thousand additional. Is in in the void coming home. Then for in a- in the house with. With the measure H. funds and over forty thousand people have entered in from housing funded it earned hold a measure age but that's not enough- mention here their economic thirty some. Points of. As the member bloom and- every day two thousand eighteen how three people escape homelessness but a hundred fifty people became homeless per day. In regards to gaps looking outside the home services delivery system- the most important that we speak is the need to overcome resistance citing. Building you have in shelters and again as other people have mentioned we need an ongoing state fund commitment that will allow local regions to build on want it is. Even happy as you know we're in a two billion dollar ongoing state commitment as recommended by the governor's council on regional- homes advisors. You know of the sixty four million- dollars are grant it we're getting from from happen- we can receive directly any heat money- but for the help money- thirty million native thirty eight million of that will- will be used to provide service for families and individuals- in in permits for. Housing as well as seventeen of the of those fund on the term thing and eight million a rapper housing there Sir. For a home transition age use find a like to mention that over the last few years the county has participated in and really. A ripple collaborative model- in part because the measure rates in the ongoing revenue. Which includes. A lot of cities we have eighty eight cities in LA county with you know LA city being the biggest one- dozens of county departments we work with a multiple. Authorities as well their seventeen I believe in the county of Los Angeles- doesn't law enforcement agencies and many many nonprofits and faith based or Bates faith based organizations- the county I truly believe that the half funding will strengthen the regional collection has been building. Since the adoption adoption of the county homes a strategy in two thousand seven actually the same day that the city adopt there's a G. we work. In tandem on the strategies and jurisdiction's voter for the energies the same day- I think that really it. Should no funds. For again. Continued ongoing for thank you great thank you we'll go to deputy secretary. Sudden thank you for I am so I am not to get to and without lot of this is already been covered in we did pull together a bit of the behind all of you and that you have. With you- that goes into a little bit and that California homeless Corning financing councils goals which include- a strategic plan process. Call out our owner rate. I'm at the- a bit more detail happened that hand out- but real quickly a couple things on here. As a reminder that the five million dollars it was at night FY eighteen ninety. All the three three C. Wicks by next and so are we recently received in your our first Inori ports on this we are as mentioned by lot as we are in the midst of analyzing- all of that road- information right now but a couple things we are seeing from that that I think might be of interest- we really are serving. Seeing is spent across the state and what we're seeing in. Front pockets. I'm either around. Made of approaches with the- number ski thing that they had seen into in their already and going to scale- and reassessing revamping systems and so and hearing a lot about how and spend specifically around emergency shelter in capital development we are seeing that but I think specifically- how that's- within the system of communities is an interesting piece of it as well I'm we are also things I'm really at. Ste. Investment concert every from prevention. Andrew for how user accessing homelessness services I'm and I would also mention and- you know you heard from for mayor shaft or a really strong commitment to housing first we're seeing some really great- commitments and proof proof of concept X. explains coming from the report. To be analyzed. Is as so nice timely hearing I want to give mega call out for being city of a was the very first application raise the this year I think that's probably wild mayor shaft left to not be- they were numbered unfortunately. Will have to take second place here- but that is for the forty two years is a fifty county and third cities I'm six. To be spent although through June after twenty. So just we- so some delays I know that this is been a conversation point in receiving those applications been hearing anecdotally that a lot of that is because many communities are in the midst of. Conduct your point in time counting so fully appreciate. En en I'm a- on that in any way while wait for apple. It just makes double that harder in the them. But we manage I. Does a few different. That I do think I'm- to out in addition to the fact that counties are giving this funding there are some answers to. Allah this is the final around but it does I will. That were in the midst Kings through he really intended to be. Amer at our go quick and this is our hope is for this that there's a little bit more of measurable goals to come out of the applications. I'm really thinking about have spending is being spent in these different buckets- in trying to. Understand. How this piece of the funding. A strong. Sort of a commitment to regional collaborations that we're expecting to see in these applications from he we put. In a letter of support from all going. Insurance the better term but we- you know. Money and CO Tienen really wanted be how the three and the and community I using their funds in a co strategy and our our looking forward to reviewing game pieces of that. And I think I'll stay for now and in and time unless there's addition one don't well wait for all the panelists to go and then we. And I am a professor of medicine at UCSF and I direct the UCSF center for volatile populations. And the UCSF homelessness and housing initiative and I come to this work as a physician and a researcher who studies homelessness- I don't need to tell you that this is one of the most pressing issues facing California- that one the- only one in nine. Americans live in California we have the honor of having one in four. People experiencing homelessness in this country like the rest of the country homelessness in California disproportionately affects certain groups. A predominately those who are black American in indigenous American. California also bears the burden of having the highest proportion of people experiencing homelessness who are on sheltered with about sixty nine percent. Of home of Californians living without shelters most of the increases that we've seen in the past two years have been amongst those living on sheltered. I think it's important to say that the increases in homelessness that we've seen have not been due to failures of the evidence based policies that focus on ending homelessness. Rather there due to the structural conditions that we face in California predominantly the critical lack of housing for extremely low income Californians. Intertwined with incomes quality. Perhaps this. He did it I tried to for us to per people from and homelessness. And it has created a problem where it's hard for us to and have people eggs as quickly as possible. California right now they're only twenty two units housing that are available and affordable for every a hundred extremely low in. The house. So extra. For those who class 30% at the end. And we are the second word state in the nation on this metric. The primary focus for solving this crisis is passed to include a plan to produce preserve and protect housing that is affordable to it for extreme low income households. This is gonna take dedicated efforts at every level of government but if we don't do it we're not going to get there. For people who experience from homelessness and struggle with behavioral health challenges like we were talking about substance use and mental health. You know what the answer is and we have good evidence it works we estimate that about 20% of people who experience homelessness fall into this category probably at any given time about half of people who are experiencing it. Are in this category because a stay homeless longer permits part of housing is simply housing that is permanent it's not a short term subsidy that's affordable to extremely low income renters. And that is offered with voluntary support of services things like case management to have meant and the like. For it to work as you heard from mayor shaft it has to be offered on a housing first basis that means for this to work the housing has to be offered with out the precondition. Friday or precondition of engagement in mental health care it can seem counterintuitive but the evidence. Stark and click. The services have to be voluntary. We know if we do this we can be successful and I just wanna point out that we've just read it completing a dance to Clara county. Downturn I. Am disabled folks are chronically homeless the most. Level of April to sit. We found for of them we'll had a hundred and four twenty four units a permits part of housing and super randomly selected who would get it and- not. Of those who were randomly selected to get it eighty five percent. Successfully house and they spent over 90% of their nights after the engaged and housing house Ste. There were that. Red this disabled population we expect for populations were slightly lower levels of disability that the numbers are even better. To create expand- PSH we really need to create the LA housing. It's good to know that most of the services could be paid through Medicaid particularly with the waiver that has been- suggested and three secretary got. And so how about the other 80% to get. How really need to read efforts to. From current and we also need for on shortening at the set when they do occur I've spoken to some of you before now research we found that half of the single adults in this state who are homeless or fifteen older and 44% of them had never been homeless before the age of fifty but what we're finding is that once they become homeless. We'll hear from my colleague Jamie some really- examples of ways that we can intervene but I will say that we know that the key to early intervention. Is to recognize quickly the people who become homeless and to have a flexible array of services and support. There are I'm they'll- yet. Stand in space rapid housing. And housing for spaces which is a care package of benefits which has time limit to subsidies assistance of moving costs and this is meant to stabilize sold. And then you've heard about the enormous success of the loss in this flexible happen pool they have used these funds for a variety of purposes things like he said. Subsidies assistance with my an port woodland. Thank and special good. Eight eight. The key to sit seems to be an flexibility. The other critical area that you've heard about today is homelessness prevention but I want to say about that is that we know we the proper time getting to police. Salt from entry. The tree so in the for these interventions to be successful they have to be what we call effective and efficient so effective means they need to work and know what seems to work this is mostly from NY and research out of New York is a kind of flexible cage that usually include some one time it's usually up to a- hundred dollars. Send pay back rent to pay utilities and then other services like legal services for eviction Chen land decent services and services increase income. Allen Chau would you rebel yet yeah. Our to get to you what's in quite for great just some in the nation and what we for the prevent targeting it to those at the highest risk and allowing for people to become homeless meaning that if you tell me that you're prevention pro Allen became. I'm gonna tell you you probably didn't target to people who are likely to become homeless anyway. Thank you. This amounts. Thank you so much good afternoon and thank you for the opportunity to share with you a day in the life of a service and housing provider in the bay area my name is Jamie I'm on Sunday executive director of bearing unity services our backs for short we have three hundred forty staff who I consider first responders in this work- to help the on shelter cried as an- backs. Thirty contract between cities counties and the state and feds. We know this crisis must have a regional approach and I promise I wrote this before all the regional questions so they will address some of them. And a collaborative approach. Two and in this problem community based organizations like back so my colleagues in the room such as St merry's abode swords to pop. We all spend. 50% of our organizational time navigating and braiding these funds together on behalf of all the government entities it is an utter waste of time that time could be doubled up double in the people we serve for backs about half of our resources from mental health and half of them come from homeless and resources. If we want to solve homelessness we need. I usually don't read my pages. Funds to be directed regionally right now we have a system that has done a services on. Room and on the other end that drought we really focus on permanent support of housing. What I've looked. Wider thing we do St out right now diners we administer the coordinated entry systems we housing locator services in case management we do permanent support of housing and then of course mental health services. I've learned it is it's the extreme it's the all or nothing so you know we're really focused on emergency services will tend to be about 1020% of the in house population need at a time. And then on the other hand of course PSH are. Out the people in the middle of the that and in our experience just tend not to get anything because of the way we've laid out the system and many. They really don't solve the problem back says turned into this the population three strategies that demand there is permanent housing resources tied to each navigation bad. Like what autumn I'm we've bought own family home. As a permanent today and the city of Oakland we house five hundred fifteen homeless seniors in Oakland and a record time of seven months- so it really goes to show that there is availability out there. We basically tested a model of rather than on rights that need space so one the things. Has now models help. Us okay nine months done people don't were that way some need a you or so people in the three some need. For years of two one Bucks some as a so we have now to a of that. We need to design model to under the true needs of the person in front of us I think we've learned that US. This they are what. Group goes to which of P. as I wrap up we of them. Is really a- region as run subsidies. When you really talk about the- question I think it's such a c<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. My ex.&lt;/c&gt;</u> In two city Okla and Berkeley. It really and- all jump over that city line and we have to re Roger. Them to down that. Killer city store. Shows I think that's where the real kind of in effect desk calls us in older. And certainly was the client and directions. Brown's I'm think about each on per needs some time of. Brown's support we an in. Of my health. Management serve how how's case management we have come of up. Of say okay this per and this. So we to do a better job of coordinating coordinating that. Can we use made an entry we- invested as a state and nay. And the- entry so I know the pet for. In where it and I know where it it's has stray. I'm but I think need to re look at that hard and fast as we can. To have these. Come down. And the other thing I'll say is you know we I I've time to many people. There to stay out. While they for voucher. So they'll say I'm stay outside for a years my fine comes up the such eight voucher. That shows us those golden ticket system. Design has been flawed and what we to do. Is really get re. To that sixty per that I talked about and then the last thing I'll say in terms of the challenges to a community based organization on the mental health side I think there are some really good questions. 50% of our staff time is to satisfying cal documentation dictated by rules from the state of California. That can be reduced to make. Percent I cannot describe more than saying every progress note house to be scrutinized in trouble read and before we're sure that we'll get that payment. That could than double the population- so I think so state rough. And of. Lost reform mental health housing. Would really. Bring double resource to the streets and I'm finally I am a firm believer of the regional subsidy pool. Idea yeah I think we've seen that were done it ourselves we have artificial. Than up market run to rate speak as right now in our- they may be tener twelve fifteen us. After that same way I'm. Lamb or got release the first. Also back leukemia Bucks a month though this age. That where regional approach to flexible so pool is real about to real create. And then she that the runs the rental does. Out of go because the home up and that were an and so just in summer provide. Cry serve. Rental subsidy that are new bay based on the person math with rap. Sir PSH for the 20% of are so people needed. Let's stop system of. PS of the in. Thank you for much thank you we're gonna open up to pay I know miss because it. Is here to a any question that we- we're mayor Brough. Comments open it to the committee for quite. This for. So all. But what are the key gaps that a way to prioritize. What would make a significant difference in making the process work better other choke points that we need to address- and I've I've my personal view is that at least in my community we spend so much attention on shelter. That we don't and that's the most controversial clearly a where you put them- as as you indicated in Los Angeles however the same argument we have the same situation I'm in Kern. But but- king at the- holistic. What what are the key gaps that we need to be addressing. I can start I think he what we've realize is that a large bloated group and then that all are not being touched anything Margo's. Sentiments were saying so that the us in our community 6% of people are getting permanent supportive housing in about twenty fifteen. That need it. And there's the shelter emergency system where spending a lot of focus which is of course- stand a bill in terms of a sister. I know who the 6280% are I do their coordinator entreat assessments- I know where they school are in the world. And all I have for the is. Eight check back later on. Maybe is very basic Robert house is very prescribe on may be. Last month deposit and if you find your own place we help you get into an city does individuals are says but don't meet the requirement to that they're not severe enough in sit in that sit in their situation to be and that's the irony person number for us in just experienced person number four thousand on the list to me looks like person number two hundred on the last and swear on the margin. Right exactly so it's really directing like that whether it's a rental subsidy pulling case management those are the two interventions to the to that. Son without having to. Wait I would say so is that as a resource to you or is that a process it was a both. I think it's I think it's both the ads directing resources and it's- eliminating some of the policies that don't allow us to serve the person in front of us- based on just how the policy. Works that. Yeah I don't think anyone. I don't think anyone would argue for not investing in permits part of housing for those most disabled it's just that if you haven't been how much. Time meet those criteria. In many parts this we offer very low. And they may be able to be. Much less and if they're not they're gonna stay out there for a long time and suffer a lot so is there is there enough service for that 60% or we just. Is it apart it made or do we need to expand that capacity or do we have it. Or is that capacity there and we're just we just that case management with lack. Right I think it is a resource that you when you have an interest to prior as to where the greatest need as and so you have a Cutie high need population on the street need part of housing that we is that's why we- are issuing. Proposition HHH bonds to develop. Sufficient support of housing then you have a large and population on the street that are trying to find resources for those immediate needs is a huge gap from the city of LA- and so you're looking at it I'm housing and the folks in the middle. The ones that have very tight that means that they're not the your prior to increase. Both those and- patient level resources to get at the people who may not have the most immediate needs but are developing them every day like they will eventually become. You they will go up that list and they will qualify for support housing. Is just to be clear that the then the solution is what. More research. Resources shocking okay to mention that Lake County there's thousand people with ulcers and- no place to go yeah. So the source issue as far as- the lack of affordable housing. And so if it so we have the thing available or advocate job and for the housing chair but is there that is the housing there is that the support housing there that's part of the resources that are needed we have we have a housing affordability crisis there's- issues we don't have enough inventory and so rents are rising we don't have enough controls on rents I think. Is a big part of it that housing is getting developed in the proper. Hi so that we rephrase my question that if you were given the resources what did you do. To address 6080% if it's if it's just if it the key is resources what would you and- sit down. With the strategy be. I think that there is a combination of investing in affordable units that are just affordable that don't require. That on going subsidy as a capital investment is sufficient to. Just support a lower rental rates so that people who. Could it could pay or rents in Florence were available to them. We have more unit. I do think there are other policy related solutions that have been- is starting to be developed around where we have- fourteen eighty two that it will it will be. Hopefully putting some. Restrictions on on rising rents for people who would then would not be losing their housing in the first place. But also- the city of LA we've established. Other hello. My Dorian can where for a exchange for dance and projects that are along those- state to find hi transit areas where they're getting big change for that lower debt that higher density that we are getting affordable units covenanted affordable you thanks James so I think that it's a combination more of a housing policy conversation that needs to be and also for those folks that are in the middle to be able to act. Even maybe even as with subsidies. Things are are very limited that's why you do see people at the section eight voucher who time out and are not able to find a unit in a to use that voucher and in the amount of time you have to use it we have and a big problem with our overall housing market and that's it. Another access with. Finding units in the private market I do think it's getting harder and harder all the time because that even that supply or tapping out. And my this guess last question if I could address into you didn't I wrote that you said that the percent of time goes to medical paperwork. And if we could. Warm that and reduce it 210% so. When you flush it out for me in terms of when that process is and how would. We streamlined that how long do you have. You know I. As long as that is he'll he'll give there's local groups- at least in the bay and I'm sure this is a state wide that have analyze the regulation and the state department of health care services medi cal regulations on the over reaching in and Berman some documentation that- very specific like right now as an example- staff person has to write a personal by the minute of service if I go out and I'm working with someone that's homeless currency mental health so stop symptoms. And I do a fourteen minute conversation I have to write. Top of page note that talks through it all for that fourteen minutes if I want to be sure that it won't get disallowed and so that. SO literally our staff 50% of their time is documentation 50% is no writing or and you know you that's the constant dancing games so I'd be happy to offer like all those. Certainly who would like to look at me so it's actual paper at youth fax over to or is it dead on. That documentation of this service to then render the bill into than get paid. Okay so it up said H. M. and some ways he if you get the lower to like one page or a monthly it says a sentence yeah verses a page literally staff para professionals all the way up to. The clinicians have right you know a substantial note to get paid for that okay why Sir I certainly want to explore that I want to get too much. Thanks very much thank you. So I have a- question that's specific because to the issue of- how well we are- actually collaborating on a regional basis and whether or not there's room for improvement- and the question relates to- cities that are nine he eligible this I think is most relevant to the- county of LA but it- in the first. In the proposed funding allocation- is there room for non heap eligible cities to receive funding because we have an on going issue in the city and a Monica where- they're not. Receiving funding for a program that has demonstrated multi disciplinary team program that has demonstrated positive results- in the going to have to- and that program in June if they don't receive funding. The perhaps Mister Ramirez you might surpass thanks to answer that well I mean we don't love you you mentioned he funding right- I think that's where the well I mean I think- frankly the jurisdiction is looking for any possible Avenue to continue this program yeah eight. Yeah turn down there applique. I'm not aware I to push on this no no worries I'm not a familiar with the application that was private that's one of our challenges in LA county is that. You know there's eighty seven other cities besides. City well. Yeah Palm Beach Pasadena Glendale are their own consumers can of care so they do get funding but for the other cities- that's been our biggest challenge we invest a lot of time trying to- get them as part. From our measure explains that I that I. On this. Of we provided cities the opera. Up apply for around fifteen million dollars worth of. No we're was. But I know it's not enough and the city's- you know a lot of them staff to even- fellow programs and several other cities believe do it the bill. There's no money I'm for you something cities to their own. But so projects like that or or programs that you mentioned up for you based on what you told me would probably would have. I'm qualified for whatever funding grants that we were providing cities- a couple years ago- dot funding and as I believe in the next come next coming fiscal year. Will be we will be looking at- musing more H. P. to provide additional funding to cities that are we are we getting funding but also on. These an regional council of governments with dean in the future so that pro innovative programs like this- that you mentioned- would get funded- either directly to the city or through a council of government- kind of- function. I'd be happy to talk to you more about this but hopefully- these the kind of issues that- can be resolved before the programs and- the folks who were responsible for carrying them out- go elsewhere and then starting it up against nearly impossible I will I will- get the message to my director who- very well. Cell so I will. Thank you. Mr person thank all panelists for your very concise presentations we could probably talk for hours on this the futures however questions of these are more request information but- from the geographic jurisdictions that were that are here I asked- both mayor shaft mayor Liccardo if you it has if they had a sense of a needs assessment and how much would it cost their their cities in the region's to address homelessness I know LA city and county you're suggesting a two billion dollar. Annual appropriation do you have a needs assessment and I'd love I know you're working on those numbers but we'd love is more of a request for information when you get those numbers love to get them yeah they also the same to San Francisco I have a sense of the numbers but love to get that we think we need more money spent just. Bye bye wondering where you are with your analysis. Assemblymember Chiu thanks for the question just wanted to point out that- the nine bay area counties are actually working to. Together under the leadership of a nonprofit called home base. To the things that we're doing is to. Being a systems map of all services available to people experiencing homelessness in that area will then used. Develop a gap analysis. To deter. Where there are. Someone much it would cost to fill those. We're also working to legal over each of my a systems together into one single system- so that were at least able to share information about people who are traveling from county to county seeking services. So some of this work is already in progress and a since I have the Mike also just wanted to point out that all echo- my colleagues and mayor shaft on the car does concerns about creating- another level of bureaucracy this regional administrator there is actually. A lot of work happening at the regional level I think this goods state. To take steps to mandate- and to take some leadership on budget having regional collaborations but I don't think adding another another layer into this funding is a particularly good idea. Because a lot of work actually already happening. I would just on that point or- of benefits. Thank missed amounts to you it also suggested there. There are definitely some benefits to regional work but it seems. You know the issue of whether we need an entire layer of a regional bureaucracy. I think is a very open question for us in the legislature so. Would love protect the after this here if you want to email us. We are you think. What you think we need to do to make sure that the regional conversations are happening- and if not a- regional entity managing that. How else should we structure to ensure those conversations occur. I'm totally deaf conversation. About silos. We know it's one it's easy to kind of focus on. Homelessness as it happens but there are many other systems are healthcare system. Our control justice system our education system our foster care system. Where breakdowns those systems are leading Thomas as- we also know there expenditures a monies in those. Their policy renew. That if they were better spent could help reduce homelessness. One in. If you of advice to us on how do we and sent. Other systems outside of the housing and homelessness system. To incent these other policy Salas. Work better with those of you. On the front lines of addressing homelessness. To do this is it I passed a bill couple years ago the governor brown side- push the conversation Harper met a chronically- clinically was. Six seven eight different policy us. I can sure just a little I think the cross systems approaches what I also call regionalization so I it backs our organization has a contract with the probation department for maybe a half a million dollars to use that as a flexible spending subsidy pull to house people on probation yeah so that's that was my kind of ultimate plane to is that set the silo we had that can be braided together so if you're looking at real supply. All kind of spending policy and I need regionalization based on the kind of intricacies of each Gen. I wouldn't have to say well let me check this box for this individual on a me to access this part of money for this. Effort and it would be just really- through policy requiring you know whether it's the criminal justice system the and I think there's I think the Senate to the well as here right now and we're all going towards the same goal but- where what it feels like in is on the streets right now is. There is you know the silos are alive and well and it's creating that the person in front us to jump through so many more hoops to house them and so. I am a large proponent of regionalization and will definitely email thoughts because I at least where I sit- we do not have regionalization we have great partnerships and relationships of talking to one another our cities and counties are amazing. Awesome and what if it what it is on the streets for us- we- do not have the regional approach. Any other comments on that so excuse me one second sorry I did apologize because I need to go I apologize for not be able to finish the remainder the hearing but Mister bloom is going to be- that turned the gavel over to Mr bloom and he's gonna finish. So appreciate that they at thank you again to all the- panelists for coming today. Up you for that and in and I very much would welcome any thoughts that you would have on. How do we and sent the breakdown of silos how do we had sent- the right conversations to happen in this kind of regional. Place my perspective- we have to devote as I've said before I think a much larger fraction of our budget around a permanent source of funding. The grub with homelessness but I suspect we could probably crap parts of different budgets. Again from education. Health criminal. Except in an and if we have a- swimming. In at some point obviously want to talk to the governor's office and administration about that if you have any comments on that yeah I would just say so as part of the- Canadian financing counsel. For a lot of that is has re up till recently been focused on just the funding sources are using far homelessness specifically I think we've- in. Since I am I don't think I'm selling him out but I'm the- it. Voters is arm. Federal I an on homelessness has been helping us through what a state to teach I am a look like- and I think some of what that look like having had experience of a level is not just thinking about the funding streams we have but so. How are the wraparound services being best use how are we sort of acknowledging where folks are are accessing different service were already providing at the state level and where might those folks come in conversations it's something we're very much looking up. As at about what check plan for the council the click straight and one final. The Amman's what you said around the bureaucracy that leads to fifty percent. Staff waste time. Up super interested that as well and- I would just say my colleague Mister Fung this might be a place for some bipartisan. Conversations of how we addresses because that's- outrageous. I think all have an interest in. Streamlining that and I think. Just say that is part of I think many natural hesitance around again at. Another level of bureaucracy. When you have three years of one time for. Each year creates a new set of requirements with players. At some point. A little bit character. It's not supposed to be so- low love love come in that area and like Mr ting I. Have that I need to be out at five. But look for to an ongoing conversation. Thank the for your engagement on this thank you. I'm gonna make one other point if I could to your question in a need. To leave us a moment Chiu but I want to point out that between two thousand and five two thousand and fifteen. Changed time is that redevelopment agencies one away and that of state investment in affordable housing- was reduced significantly a lot of what we're talking about in the risen to brand funding together and to be more efficient and I'm a huge support court did and better systems but at the end of the day. All is. Right a resource that everybody needs there's not enough of so I really hope that the state will focus strongly on the need for more housing because at the end of the day we're not going to be a we can have the best systems in the most rated well find systems in the world but if there's not a housing the end of the day this is gonna can. AB one. And also a point out that we're talking about. And also want to point out that during in 18322% of all Americans. Or home 2% of Americans were nineteen thirty two by nineteen sixty that was zero. That was zero and that this the solution is so in reach amended to work on time in the solution so in which were not. Really need to focus on housing at the state level. Let us locally focus on how we're going to collaborate better we need to and have to do a better job and we're we're working on it we hope that the state will really focus in on what I know assemblyman Chiu you. I was very hot there needs to be more housing read. As we just. Leadership in our city on that and I could not agree with you more- I. Stuck my colleagues know benefit of a broken record for my. Four should we lost almost two billion dollars a year. That we used to test and- housing. And over ten years dot spin awful lot of money and I think that's the scale that we need to reply back to the- to the since our but it's gonna take. A bigger conversation the legislature it's very difficult to talk about increasing funding beyond the five. Six seven hundred fifty million dollars talking about. So for to figure out how we build that consensus on making that. Thank you. Thank you the only thing I would add is that- at the loss of redevelopment as a harsh is it what does only exacerbate. Portable housing that's been produced over the last forty years or so- so this is a long standing problem- redevelopment kind of filled at the breach to a certain ex.

A Grammy and we do know that you are more vulnerable to victimization when they are homeless. They lose all of their possessions they take a step back in school and there isn't any other dedicated source of funding. To our youth so it's so important that this year's budget investment does include a ten percent set aside for our use based on the point time counts thank you. Thank you very much. Dr Cooper. Right here Steve but if. Thank you I hope this is being written up somewhere in a fascinating. It's actually matter fact I'm was the state support of housing coalition we're focused on permanent support housing for people with serious mental illness. And that's something we're- we're really focused on that but it relates a lot to other things you're talking about I think. One thing I hope doesn't disappear if the- if the governor's proposal doesn't really get incorporated the ways proposed at this time is that part of that was to be able to subsidize board care homes to prevent homelessness. You know because if they go they're going out of business if they go out of business they're gone- you know some cities San Francisco to good example only because he's doing some stuff that way to or trying to figure out how to stop that. And you know maybe it didn't to be a part. Well we got a with. Because it's gone will. And so open that that part. Was Cervantes. This process. Thank you Margot down. Molly and does an early. I'm no dash and I'm with the national lines on mental illness the East Bay affiliate and also with the East Bay supportive housing collaborative that Steve just mentioned. Assembly member bloom I heard you say something about reservation. In this seven hundred and fifty million dollars for a set aside for Borden cares and I would like to know more about your reservation but we were very lifted in our hearts to hear that there was some attention to stabilizing the license. Do emphasize the license and cares so many people including young people of who descend into the- horrors of psychosis need the stabilization bad a board and care can five hello. Boarding talking about. Management vicious food mental stimulation these are the things that help people gain recovery and get on their feet when we put people in just old boarding houses shelters we're going to recycle them again and again through fifty one fifties and to the streets thank you- we do hope for that thank thank you for your comment and tap my comment about for care fund it is. A essentially has to do with whether or not it might be better to have a funding source outside of the seven hundred fifty million since- many people- important care homes are potential potentially going to become homeless but there are many more- who will and there's just the confluence of interested the bank. Might make it better to have a separate funding source for that kind of our badly in agreement about the importance of the issue and it is shipped csus can. Did you. Want me to read your comment or did you want. We have only and- where to please give that AA. I'm Erik are fun to a yeah health the people that suffer with men health connection and print out each service. Approach in our research that can help target those that population because that population I'd I also happen this in that scene I recycling through homelessness and it becomes like a to site to families.

Welcome hi welcome thank you very much- I wanted to express our thanks and gratitude for the state's support and thought partnership my name is market back allowing the policy director at compass family services here in San Francisco- I wanted to echo the- the partners we need. I'm going to spending. And without additional of bureaucracy the money is. Flowing there's a the regulations that the prevent us from help the person right in front of us now- we also need to change the public conversation around cleaning the streets I we need to put people. And complaints about the sidewalks should not be the primary engines power almost systems. What we need to look beyond this there are a lot of fan that are doubled up in overcrowded and sub housing conditions and they're basically living and functional sheltered homelessness states and the regulations are and always capturing- those living situations as homelessness- there the families are very precariously house across the state the pic counts count about fourteen thousand children. Oldest data so much for over. Almost us statewide has increased on by more than years so- I think the point here is that homelessness and Pete's children intellectual social emotional and physical development- and children who are homeless are five times more likely to become homeless homeless as adults so we make sure that are meant our intervention now targeted antenna third. Homelessness is an provide the future almost. Of our- thank you could wrap up here thank you very much Choi. Liliana bonds. Hi hi I'm nervous but my name is Donna lawns in Asia of all in at the homes I have I will speak for myself and for other young women like me I feel like I've been senior everybody talk about making decisions about people like me and my community but I'm actually person that has been through it and I feel like I had been homeless for over four years I have two children I'm twenty years old- I had a homeless when I was sixteen I can not the services I thought we need continuing of money coming in but we all. Hold these these- I can you. Into your and- like for me I will homeless and I was proud. I could not get into a shelter it was so hard for me. I can get into a temporary shelter I want to the access points I want to compass I want to everywhere I needed to go. But because I didn't. That category of looking homeless. And sleep my car but because I wasn't physically on. I looked I get prioritize and I feel like. That's not ext. Especially when you're pregnant and you don't have no other sources used to prioritize. And I thought they should. Fix the way that this the system is because I know even with subsidies subsidies are temporary that is just a cycle putting people back into homelessness. And that's unacceptable you don't see when you get a subsidy and is pushing people farther out so that's what people want to lay- they're going to Stockton they want all these places. You can afford to the city California's is so expensive. In one sentence in its absurd there's not enough money that's a different flowing through your senses are so much money. And it's like how can you guys say or entry a pregnant woman like that and in people families. Like I understand it is a big thing I live here in the tenderloin. Like the mental health issues. Sources to the access. I did. It will get. It was so hard I to go to the high team I think goal his ex as the help me I had to advocate for myself at a push muscle to meet the exact director if you could please wrap up please- but I just want to see more people in the community and trying to help. To stabilize housing especially from. It's not just people with mental health issues so many young women and children and youth and families homeless street it is unacceptable especially in the city that we live in the house so much more thank thank you very much for your comment and our last. Year's Tyler I'm sorry I can't make out the last name Tyler. Hi in the without county behavior how to act as a- welcome. Group my name so couple things I'd like to I'm the for on how. And housing that we have in here in California- but we'd like to advocate to have- a focus on prevention and early intervention- individuals experiencing homelessness- we know that the longer end of. Days on the streets and experiences the trauma of the streets that the more likely they are to develop or exacerbated by here for of can. And the more expensive they are going to be to end up receiving treatment and to stabilize them. Arm we'd like to be supportive of you going to the existing model that was under half for funding for cities counties and it CEO sees rather than this you know. Regional administrator bottle arm there's a lot of things that are under five. I'm were also supportive of. Assembly member bloom what you mentioned I've I the crisis aborted. Our losing them today have a separate propose. To have them in. A separate pot of funding where will it be concerned about if that money slice three different ways between housing development. I'm rental subsidies and boarding cares that we may continue to lose warning cares and they will not be stabilized as that's a very critical- component of care and housing for our population and for others with disabilities. So thank you for the time. Thank you very much for comments- and applause for everyone- especially- those of. You who are still here and stuck it out for the whole meeting. Congratulations to you it's good that we took the time that we- debt to consider. This important issue this is an issue that- across the state our constituents are tell us- is their number one concern and I. Level and- level we're not seriously that's why we have this hearing today and to thank you all for participating.
