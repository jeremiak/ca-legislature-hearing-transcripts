GOALS. X. OUT GOLF IS THE SKI GOT IT. WELL THANK YOU FOR COMING IN PLEASE [inaudible] HER. FROM THE ALEJO. THANK YOU FOR COMING. AND PLEASE PROCEED OF THIS AS A AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE AND I HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR PLEASE. SURE -- SO AGAIN PAUL GOES ISCHEMIC THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THE SERGEANT IS DISTRIBUTING A HANDOUT FROM WHICH I'LL BE SPEAKING. AND THEY'LL BE FOR PARTS TO MY PRESENTATION TODAY FIRST I WANTED TO DISCUSS BRIEFLY OUR OFFICES ROLE AND THE INITIATIVE PROCESS AND THEN I'D PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND ON FUEL AND VEHICLE TAX IS. AFTER THAT I'LL DESCRIBE THE INITIATIVE PROPOSAL -- AND THEN LAST THEY'LL DISCUSS ITS FISCAL AFFECTS. A SO TO START -- I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT OUR OFFICES ROLE -- IN THE INITIATIVE PROCESS IS QUITE DE. PROCESS -- FOR MEMBERS FOR ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. THEY MIGHT BE FAMILIAR WITH OUR OFFICE COMING -- TO COMMITTEE -- ASSESSING VARIOUS BUDGET PROPOSALS AND MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS -- WE DON'T DO THAT WITH THE INITIATIVE PROCESS BECAUSE STATE LAW REQUIRES US TO PREPARE AN IMPARTIAL FISCAL ANALYSIS -- SO WE DON'T -- EVALUATE THE MERITS OF INITIATIVE PROPOSALS AND WE DON'T MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER ON THEM -- SO MY COMMENTS TODAY WILL BE PURELY DESCRIBING WHAT THE MEASURE DOES AS WELL AS ESTIMATING ITS FISCAL A FAX -- THE OTHER THING I WE KNOW IS THAT THE HENDO AND MY COMMENTS TODAY OUR TENTATIVE OUR FINAL ANALYSIS ISN'T DUE TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE -- UNTIL JULY SO WE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING IT SO I WOULD CHEAT THESE -- REMARKS AND HENDEL AS TENTATIVE FOR NOW. SO IF YOU TURN TO THE PAGE OF THE HANDOUT LABELED BACKGROUND HOW QUICKLY. GO OVER SOME BACKGROUND MATERIAL TO GET YOU ORIENTED BUT YOU PROBABLY ALREADY FAMILIAR WITH MUCH OF IT -- AS YOU KNOW CURRENTLY THE LEGISLATURE CAN ONLY PASS THE TAX WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE. AND THE LEGISLATURE'S -- I MEAN THE VOTERS ARE NOT INVOLVED IN -- PASSING THESE TAX INCREASES IT'S JUST DONE THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS TO THE GOVERNOR. I'M TERMS THIS FUEL AND VEHICLE TAX IS SPECIFICALLY THAT ARE CHARGED BY THE STATE AND THE STATE HAS EXCISE AND SALES TAXES ON GASOLINE AND DIESEL FUEL. IS AUTHOR IN TAXES ON VEHICLES. THE STATE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THAT THE REVENUES FROM THESE TAXES BE SPENT ON TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES. ON WITH ONE MAJOR EXCEPTION WHICH IS THE VEHICLE LICENSE FEE ON THOSE REVENUES ARE NOT LIMITED TO TRANSPORTATION. AND CURRENTLY THEY LET LET JUST THEM -- TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND A PUBLIC SAFETY PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- SO AS YOU'RE ALL AWARE RECENTLY LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PASSED S. B. ONE ON APRIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO INCREASE. SOME OF THE FUEL AND VEHICLE TAX IS -- TO FUND HIGHWAY AND ROAD MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR. AS WELL AS TRANSIT PROGRAMS ANOTHER TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS. AND THERE'S A FIGURE ON PAGE -- TO WHERE WE SUMMARIZE THE VARIOUS -- TAXES AND AND FEES THAT WERE INCREASE THE SP ONE I WON'T GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM SINCE I'M SURE YOU'RE YOU'RE FAIRLY FAMILIAR WITH THE PACKAGE -- BUT BROADLY SPEAKING -- SP ONE INCREASED GAS GAS TAXES DIESEL TAXES. AS WELL AS CREATED IN YOU TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT FEE ON VEHICLES AND I ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE FEE -- IF YOU THESE -- THIS CHARGER STARTED TAKING A FACT AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ON IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AND IF YOU LOOK THE LAST COLUMNS OF THE FIGURE WE SHOW THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL REVENUES FROM SP. ONE IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND IT'S ESTIMATED AT FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION -- GROWING IN A COUPLE YEARS TO A LITTLE OVER FIVE BILLION ANNUALLY. I'M THE REASON WHY INCREASES IS THAT NOT ALL OF THE CHARGES HAVE TAKEN EFFECT YET. ON AND ALSO THE CHARGES ARE INDEXED FOR INFLATION IN THE FUTURE SO THAT'S THAT'S WHY THEY THINK GROW. IN THE OUT YEARS. SO REGARDING THE INITIATIVE MEASURE WE DESCRIBED ON PAGE THREE OF THE HANDOUT IT'S AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION -- ESSENTIALLY DOES TWO THINGS. THE FIRST IS THAT REQUIRES THE LEGISLATURE TO GET VOTER APPROVAL FOR SPECIFIED FUELING VEHICLE TAXES. AND SPECIFICALLY THE SUPPLIES TO TAXES ON THE SALE STORAGE USE AND CONSUMPTION OF GASOLINE AND DIESEL FUEL. IT ALSO APPLIES TO TAXES PAID FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF OPERATING A VEHICLE ON PUBLIC HIGHWAYS. AND SUCH AS VEHICLE LICENSE FEES THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER AS WELL AS TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT FEES WHICH WERE CREATED BY S. B.. THE SECOND THING THE INITIATIVE MEASURE DOES IS IT ELIMINATES RECENTLY ENACTED -- SUCH SUCH RECENTLY ENACTED FUEL AND VEHICLE TAX IS. A SPECIFICALLY IT WOULD APPLY. TO ANY SUCH FEELING VEHICLE TAXES AND ACTED BETWEEN JANUARY FIRST TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND THE DATE THE MEASURE TAKES A FAT. AND IF IT IS PASSED BY THE VOTERS WOULD TAKE EFFECT IN DECEMBER -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND SO SENSE SB ONE WAS ENACTED IN APRIL. TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS MEASURE WOULD APPLY TO THE TAXES IN SP ONE AND ON THE LAST PAGE I SUMMARIZE THE FISCAL AFFECTS THAT OUR OFFICE -- HAS ESTIMATED WE THINK THERE'S TWO MAIN FISCAL IMPLICATIONS FROM THE INITIATIVE. THE FIRST IS THAT WOULD ELIMINATE TAX REVENUES FROM SP ONE AND AS I MENTIONED EARLIER OF THE SORT OF ONGOING IN THE OUT YEARS THIS WOULD BE ROUGHLY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY AND LESS FUNDING -- IN THIS FUNDING MAINLY WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED HIGHWAY AND ROAD MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR PROGRAMS AS WELL AS TRANSIT PROGRAMS AND SOME OTHER TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS -- THAT MEASURE THOUGH DOES NOT AFFECT OTHER PROVISIONS THAT WERE IN SB ONE IT REALLY REALLY JUST WOULD ELIMINATE THE TAX REVENUES SO S. B. ONE DID CONTAIN SOME OTHER. PROVISIONS REGARDING -- INCREASED ACCOUNTABILITY -- OVER TRANSPORTATION SPENDING IT WOULD NOT AFFECT THOSE THOSE PROVISIONS. THE SECOND MAN FISCAL IMPLICATION THAT WE SEE IS THAT WOULD MAKE -- PASSAGE OF FUEL AND VEHICLE TAXES IN THE FUTURE MORE DIFFICULT AND THIS IS DUE TO THE VOTER APPROVAL REQUIREMENT WOULD BE ANOTHER STEP IN THE PROCESS TO INCREASING TAXES SO COULD MEAN LESS REVENUE THAN OTHERWISE. HOWEVER WHERE UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS OF THIS -- AS IT WOULD DEPEND ON FUTURE. THE VOTERS WHICH WE CANNOT PREDICT. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WERE -- WE HAVE A SIMPLE PROCESS NOW ON TO OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND SO CAN HAVE PEOPLE COME FORWARD TO THE MY RIGHT OVER HERE AND MAKE THEIR COMMENTS. AS THEY PLEASE SO -- EACH PERSON WILL BE ALLOWED A COUPLE MINUTES. APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND ENERGY SO. WHAT IS A WHY DON'T WE START WHEN WE START WITH YOU DAVID? IN ADDITION TO SELF AND NAM. IF YOU'RE STATEMENT FOR TWO MINUTES PLEASE THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ACTED EVENING NOW DAVID WILL FOR THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION I THINK WE'RE THE ONLY ONE HERE IN FAVOR OF THE MEASURE SO IT'S PROBABLY BEST THAT I GO FIRST ANYWAY -- AGAIN THIS MEASURE WOULD REPEAL THE GAS AND CAR TAX AND PUT IT ANY FUTURE SOME MORE TAXES TO A STATEWIDE VOTE OF THE PEOPLE. MEMBERS SOMETIME THIS WEEK THE GOVERNOR WILL SIGN A RECORD HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET WITH ANY BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS AT A TIME WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE AMONG THE HIGHEST GAS AND CAR TAXES. IN THE NATION. YES TAXES ARE TOO HIGH BUT THAT'S NOT PRIMARILY THE REASON WE'RE SUPPORTING THIS EFFORT. WE OPPOSE THESE TAXES BECAUSE OF THIS LEGISLATURE'S INABILITY TO MANAGE THE DOLLARS TAXPAYERS HAVE ENTRUSTED THEM. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A CAP AND TRADE FELONS HAVE BEEN DROPPED INTO THE GENERAL FUND THE LAST FIVE YEARS. TEN BILLION DOLLARS A TRUCK WAIT FEES OVER THE LAST DECADE HAVE BEEN DIVERTED FROM AWAY FROM MAINTAINING AND REPAIRING OUR ROADS. KEYMOD AWAY MEMBERS GENERAL FUND SPENDING HAS INCREASED BY FORTY BILLION DOLLARS THE LAST SEVEN YEARS WITH NOT ONE DIME AGAIN NOT ONE DIME. GOING TO TRANSPORTATION. MEMBERS IN CLOSING WE ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITHTHE OPPONENTS OF THIS MEASURE THAT OUR ROADS NEED TO BE REPAIRED AND THAT WE DO INDEED HAVE A FORTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR ROAD MAINTENANCE BACKLOG. FOR THAT PROBLEMS THE LEGISLATURE'S TO FIX USING EXISTING RECORD HIGH REVENUES AND SHOULD NOT BE A BURDEN TO HARD WORKING CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS THINK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WEEK REPLACE YOUR AT GOOD GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIRMAN BRIAN ANA SECRETARY THE STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY. AND STATE TRANSPORTATION AGENCY IS COMPLETED THE FIRST PROGRAMMING OR WAR AWARD ROUND FOR SP ONE WITH OVER FIVE THOUSAND PROJECTS APPROVED TO RECEIVE S. B. ONE FUNDING. AND THAT JUST COVERS THE FIRST COUPLE YEARS. WE EXPECT THOUSANDS MORE PROJECTS TO BE FUNDED WITH SP ONE OVER THE NEXT DECADE. NOW THAT WE KNOW THE AWARDED PROJECTS WE HAVE A BETTER IDEA OF WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE REPEAL MAJOR WERE TO PASS. THOUSANDS OF SAFETY AND MAINTENANCE PROJECTS ON LOCAL ROADS FILLING POTHOLES FIXING PAVEMENT MAKING CROSSWALKS MORE SAFE. WOULD NOT OCCUR. HUNDREDS OF HIGHWAY BRIDGES WOULD NOT RECEIVE SAFETY REPAIRS REPLACEMENT. THOUSANDS OF MILES OF PAPER REPAIR WOULD NOT OCCUR ON STATE HIGHWAYS. TRANSFORMATIVE PROJECTS TO ADDRESS COMMUTER AND FOR A CONGESTION WOULD NOT OCCUR OR THE SIGNIFICANTLY DELAYED. PROJECTS SUCH AS BART TO SAN JOSE. SACRAMENTO HIGHWAY FIFTY HOV LANES AND WHY RAIL IMPROVEMENTS. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAN PRUNE AND STUFF HIGHWAYS FIVE TEN FIFTY SEVEN ONE ON ONE AND OTHERS. VERY IMPROVEMENTS TO HIGHWAY ONE OR WHAT ONE A ONE SMART IN CALTRAIN. CENTRAL VALLEY IMPROVEMENTS TO HIGHWAY NINETY NINE AND RAIL INVESTMENTS AND LOS ANGELES TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT OLYMPICS TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. MANY WOULD LIKELY BE DELAYED UNTIL AFTER THE GAMES OCCUR. THE BOTTOM LINE. IF THE REPEAL WERE TO OCCUR PAVEMENT WOULD GET WORSE INSTEAD OF BETTER. SAFETY PROJECTS WOULD BE DEFUNDED. AND PEOPLE AND THE ECONOMY WOULD NOT BENEFIT FROM CONGESTION RELIEF INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS [inaudible] THANK YOU. NEXT BAKER PUT. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN NAME IS ASSISTANT CHIEF RICH DESMOND REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. IT'S THE JOB THE CHP TO BE OUT ON THE ROADWAYS EVERY DAY KEEPING CALIFORNIAN SAFE AND I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY EXPERIENCE MY TWENTY THREE YEARS OF THE CHP. AS WELL AS IN THE EXPERIENCE OF EVERY OTHER CHP OFFICER. THAT KEEPING OUR ROADS MAINTAINED IS CRITICAL TO KEEPING MOTOR SAFE ON OUR ROADWAYS. THE CHP IS CONFIDENT THAT IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW ON OUR ROADS FREEWAYS AND BRIDGES. COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WOULD RESULT IN A NEWER MORE MODERN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. THAT WILL BE SAFER FOR MOTORISTS CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS AND OTHER FIRST RESPONDERS. AND INVESTMENT IN TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS LIKE THESE IS AN INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC SAFETY THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] PLEASE GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIRMAN MANY MRS IN BRANSON I SERVICE YOU EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. I IT OVER THE LAST DECADE THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION HEADED BY SO LEGISLATURE ON THE NEED. TO SECURE THE THE NECESSARY IN STABILIZING NECESSARY TRANSPORTATION FUNDING. OTHERS SAID ARE CONCERNED THAT THE COMMISSION HAD CAME TO REALITY IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WHEN THE COMMISSION ON CALIFORNIA WAS FACED WITH A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR TRANSPORTATION FUNDING SHORTFALL. THAT FORCE A TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION TO DE PROGRAM AND DELAY PROJECTS THAT WE'RE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN COMMITTED FOR A STATE FUNDING. IN THE STATE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. THIS SHORTFALL MEANT THAT THE COMMISSION NOT ONLY REMOVED PREVIOUSLY COMMITTED FUNDING FROM HUNDREDS OF PROJECTS. IT ALSO MEANT THAT NOT A SINGLE NEW PROJECT TO IMPROVE THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. COULD BE ADDED OVER THE FIVE YEARS THAT STATE TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM. AS OF THE COMMISSION'S MAY MEETING THIS YEAR THE COMMISSION HAS DEDICATED OVER NINE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO PROJECTS THAT WILL PROVIDE BENEFITS TO COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. THOUSANDS OF PROJECTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED TO FIX BRIDGES HIGHWAYS REPAIRMAN EIGHTEEN OVER FOUR THOUSAND LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS. REDUCE CONGESTION IN THE MOST CONGESTED CORRIDORS OF THE STATE. PROVIDE FOR SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOLS IMPROVE AND EXPAND TRANSIT IN MORE. THE COMMISSION HAS ALSO ADOPTED IN IS ALREADY EXERCISING STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND OVERSIGHT. TO ENSURE THAT FUNDS ARE APPROPRIATELY AND EFFECTIVELY SPENT AND ACCOUNTED. FOR WITHOUT THE REVENUES PROVIDED BY SENATE BILL ONE WE KNOW THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT FUNDS TO MAINTAIN OUR BRIDGES HIGHWAYS. LOCAL STREETS ROSE TRANSIT BY PROTESTING FIELDS FACILITIES AND MORE. CRITICALLY NEEDED PROJECTS WILL HAUNT. EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE WILL CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE. JOBS WILL BE LOST AND THE ECONOMY ENVIRONMENT AND QUALITY OF LIFE WILL BE AFFECTED FOR THIS IN FUTURE GENERATIONS AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE [inaudible] THANK YOU. I JUST LLOYD PEREIRA A MY COUNTY SUPERVISOR FROM THE COUNTY MERCED SERVING DISTRICT. FOR AND THINK YOU FOR A CONVENING THIS HEARING. UP MERCED COUNTY -- TAKES A TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AS A HIGH PRIORITY -- WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED MILES OF ROAD. OUR ROAD SYSTEM IS DETERIORATED OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS DUE TO LACK OF FUNDING. THE THE COUNTY IS ONE OF THE LARGEST AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS IN CALIFORNIA AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT OUR NATION. AND THE ARE CRUMBLING OF THE ROADS IN THE DETERIORATION AYE IS A IS A HEAVY ECONOMIC A BURDEN THAT -- ARE FARMERS OF PAY AND AND THE COST OF TRANSPORTING THEIR CROPS TO MARKET -- I ASSUME THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA LIKE TO EAT APPLES PEACHES AND GRAPES AND IF YOU CAN IMAGINE -- THOSE OF FRUITS BEEN HOLD OVER HOLES -- THEY THE PACK OUT IS ABOUT 18% LESS THAN IT WOULD BE IF THEY WERE DRIVEN ON A SMOOTH ROAD SO IT'S A HIGH BURDEN FOR OUR FARMERS SAT AT TO PAY. SP ONE PROVIDES A STEADY FUNDING SOURCE OF FOR THE REPAIR REHABILITATION AND RECONSTRUCTION OF THE OF MERCED COUNTY ROAD SYSTEM. A WE ARE PROJECTED TO REACH SIX US RECEIVE SIX POINT FOUR MILLION A DOLLARS IN THE UP COMING FISCAL YEAR. AND THAT'LL ALLOW US TO REPAIR THIRTY THREE MILES OF ROAD. WHICH WILL TAKE US FORTY EIGHT YEARS TO GET THROUGH OF THE ROADS AND MERCED COUNTY SO HAVE I I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR THE MONEY -- THE DEDICATED FUNDING PROVIDED BY S. B. WON WILL ALLOW US TO DEVELOP A LONG TERM PAVEMENT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL CONDITION OF THE COUNTY'S ROAD SYSTEM. IF SB ONE IS REPEALED WE WILL BE FACED AND LAYING OFF A PORTION OF OUR ROAD MAINTENANCE STAFF WHICH WOULD SEVERELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY. TO PRODUCE A PROVIDE BASIC ROAD MAINTENANCE -- OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS AND THAT INCLUDES TIMELY PATCHING POTHOLES STRIPING AND STENCILING OF COUNTY ROADS AND SCHOOLS OWNS. DELAYED REPLACEMENT OF MISSING DAMAGE OR TERRY DID ROAD SIGNS MAINTENANCE REPAIRS OF THE SHOULDERS SO WITHOUT A S. B. ONE IT WOULD PUT OUR COUNTY AT A SEVERE DISADVANTAGE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

THE VALUE OF THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IS SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. AND WE CANNOT TEAM YOU TO IGNORE. MAINTAINING THAT VITAL ASSET I MEAN THINK ABOUT EVERY DAY RESIDENTS AND BUSINESS OWNERS. TOUCH OUR STREETS MULTIPLE TIMES EVERY DAY. TO MAINTAIN OUR THREE INNER NEEDY MILES OF STREETS WE NEED ABOUT SIX AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR. WE HAVE A FOREIGN A HALF MILLION DOLLAR PER YEAR GAP. SP ONE PROVIDES FOR THE CITY THOUSAND OAKS. THREE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR GOING FORWARD FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS THAT IS A HUGE. STOP IN OUR GAP. AND THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT IN THE NEXT TEN YEARS WITHOUT THAT FUNDING. THE CONDITION OF OUR ROADS WILL DROP. BY WELL OVER TEN POINTS THE RELATIVE KIND OF THING BUT CLEARLY THAT'LL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO THE QUALITY ALIVE IN THE ECONOMIC VITALITY AND SEE THOUSAND OAKS. TODAY WE STARTED PAVING REPAIRING STREETS IN THE DARLINGTON NEIGHBORHOOD THREE THREE MILES OF STREETS IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD. I AND THAT'S JUST OF PART OF A LARGER PROJECT THAT WE WORKING ON THIS SUMMER. AND INTO THE FALL OVER FIFTY MILES STREETS WERE GONNA BE ABLE TO RESURFACE REPAVE SLURRY SEAL THAT'S IN.

UP ALL OF WHICH IS PROGRAM FOR PAVING OUR STREETS AND IMPROVING DRAINAGE AND STORM WATER QUALITY OF ON ONE OF OUR MAJOR STREETS. WITHOUT SP ONE FUNDING A ONE MILLION DOLLAR LEVERAGED GRANT WOULD BE AT RISK IN OUR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM FOR STREETS WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE STOPPED. WE WOULD JUST WE JUST COMPLETED A NEW PAVEMENT MANAGEMENT SURVEY AND THE RESULTS TELL US THAT WE NEED TO PLAN ON SPENDING ABOUT THREE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR FOR THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS. TO KEEP OUR STREETS AND GOOD STATE OF REPAIR WE NEED SP ONE FUNDING TO GET THIS WORK DONE. IN FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE GATEWAY CITIES CAN -- COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS BOARD TOOK A POSITION OF UNANIMOUS OPPOSITION TO THE REPEAL OF SB ONE THE LOSS OF THESE FUNDS WOULD DERAIL PROJECTS LARGE AND SMALL. THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN OUR SUFFERS FROM CHRONIC UNDER INVESTMENT AND DISINVESTMENT. THE IMPACTS OF LOSING SB ONE OF THE GATEWAY CITIES WOULD INCLUDE THE INTERSTATE SIX OH FIVE STATE ROUTE NINETY ONE INTERCHANGEABLY MEANT. A GATEWAY CITIES FOR A CROSSROADS THE ESTIMATED COST OF A HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION AND THE THIRTY TWO MILLION SP ONE FUNDS.

THE CITY OF LODI HAS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED LANE MILES OR TWO HUNDRED MILES OF STREETS AND ON AVERAGE SPENDS APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS EACH YEAR ON STREET MAINTENANCE. WHICH IS DEFINITELY NOT ENOUGH. FUNDING TO PROPERLY MAINTAIN OUR STREETS HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY SCARCE AND ALTHOUGH WE CONSISTENTLY SEEK MORE COST EFFECTIVE METHODS OF ROAD MAINTENANCE. THE CONDITION OF OUR ROADWAYS CONTINUE TO SUFFER. S. B. ONE ENABLE CITIES AND COUNTIES TO ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION NEEDS ON OUR LOCAL STREETS AND ROADS THE CITY OF LODI. IS SET TO RECEIVE NEARLY EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OVER TEN YEARS NOW WILL DEFINITELY BE. NEEDED OVER TO TO REPAIR PARA ROADS THAT ARE IN POOR CONDITION.

AND NEXT YEAR WE HAVE PROGRAMMED FIVE AND A HALF MILES OF RESURFACING PROJECTS -- THAT OUR CITY COUNCIL HAS APPROVED TO BE INCLUDED IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET. BOTH OF THESE PROJECTS AS WELL AS FUTURE RED MENACE PROJECTS ARE AT RISK IF THIS. INITIATIVE IS APPROVED. THE CITY OF LUBBOCK SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD TO THE LAYER CUT. THESE PROJECTS THAT WILL FINALLY ALLOW US TO BEGIN PERFORMING BADLY NEEDED ROAD MAINTENANCE THAT HAS BEEN DEFERRED DUE TO CONSISTENT FUNDING SHORTFALLS.

THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE PAYING MORE IN GAS TAXES AND I THINK WE HAVE TO MAKE MORE OF AN EFFORT TO CONNECT THAT -- OF ARGUING WITH THE PUBLIC OUR IS -- TO TALK ABOUT ALL THE GREAT BENEFITS I CLEARLY HAVE A LONG LIST OF PROJECTS FOR MY CLIENTS HAVE BENEFITTED FROM THANKS TO THE PASSAGE OF SB. ONE BUT IT'S REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE VALUE PROPOSITION THIS OF MAINTAINING THAT TRANSPORTATION FUNDING WATER MY PAYING AS A TAXPAYER. IFILL MY POTHOLES TO MAINTAIN TRANSIT SERVICE TO REPAVE HIGHWAYS OR LEVY CONGESTION.

I AM ADMIRE THOSE [inaudible] HERE TODAY CLAIM. TO WANT TO REBUILD OUR ROADS. OUR ROADS NEED TO BE REBUILT. HOWEVER WE ALREADY PAY THE PRIVILEGE. OF GOOD ROADS. THE SECOND HIGHEST GAS TAX IN THE COUNTRY BEFORE THIS INCREASE WENT INTO EFFECT. SO I ASK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND WE ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER WHAT YOU DO WITH THE MONEY. WHY DIDN'T WE REBUILD THE ROADS? WHY DON'T WE FILL THE POTHOLES? BECAUSE WE'RE TOO BUSY FILLING THE PENSION HOLE. BECAUSE WE WERE TOO BUSY ADDING STAFF. WITHOUT ACTUALLY WORRYING ABOUT COMPLETING PROJECTS. BECAUSE WE WERE TOO BUSY ELIMINATING LANES WITHROW DIETS TRANSFERRING MONEY TO COVER THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET DEFICIT. AND OF COURSE DECIDING THAT ROADS ARE IMPORTANT. BUT MASS TRANSIT INNER CITY LIGHT RAIL HIGH SPEED RAIL IS MORE IMPORTANT. WE NEED TO REJECT THE TAX INCREASE. YOU SHOULD HAVE DONE THIS BY NOW. ONE OF YOUR MEMBERS LOST HIS JOB. BECAUSE OF THIS AND I WILL SUBMIT TO YOU THAT MORE OF YOU WILL PROBABLY LOSE YOUR JOBS. IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION BECAUSE THIS IS ON THE BALLOT. AND RIGHTFULLY SO. YOU FORCED THE TAXPAYERS. TO COLLECT ALMOST A MILLION SIGNATURES. BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT LISTEN TO THEM. BUT YOU WILL HEAR THEM IN NOVEMBER. DO MATTER WHAT HAS SPENT CERTAINLY ASK YOU BUT UP TWO MINUTES NO MATTER WHAT YOU SPEND NO MATTER WHAT SORT OF MISINFORMATION YOU PROVIDE.

FIVE BUT REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE INVESTMENT THAT ALL OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA ABSOLUTELY TO SERVE. WE KNOW AS A MATTER OF FACT THAT WE HAVE LOST PURCHASING POWER AND ANY TIME YOU DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THE WAY THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOCAL COMMUNITIES OF HAD TO DO. OVERTIME GETS FOR MORE EXPENSIVE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO FIX THE ROADS AND SO THIS A MEASURE SENATE BILL ONE WAS A GREAT MOMENT FOR US IN CALIFORNIA IT REINSTATED OR ABILITY TO ADDRESS THE CONDITION OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. IT WAS FORTIFIED WITH PROTECTIONS THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER FOR PUTTING THEM MEASURE BEFORE THE VOTERS AND IT'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MOVE THE NEEDLE AND FIX THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT SO DESERVEDLY NEEDS ATTENTION SO FOR THAT. WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP. ANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT LIKE TO SPEAK [inaudible] THIS HEARING. PRO OR CON [inaudible] SEEING NONE.

WHO WANT TO THANK THE PUBLIC FOR THEIR COMMENTS AND BRING THIS OUT WE DID ADVERTISE THIS? OFFER FOR CONTINUAL DAYS -- GOING FORWARD AS WE ARE REQUIRED. TO AND OF ALL IS HOW MY VICE CHAIR I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. AND COME WILL MOVE ON THANK YOU CHAIRMAN FRAZIER I APPRECIATE EVERYONE COMING AND AND AND NOW. EXPRESSING THEIR OPINIONS UP. I CAN I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR EVERYONE ON THIS DIES THAT NO ONE OPPOSES INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT -- THERE ARE CLEAR DISAGREEMENTS ON HOW TO FUND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND I THINK IT'S VERY APPARENT. A OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS THAT CALIFORNIA MOTORISTS AND COWBOY RESIDENTS THEY WANT TO SAY AND SO. ON IF THIS INITIATIVE PASSES I THINK IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS LEGISLATORS TO TALK ABOUT ALTERNATIVES TO FIGURE OUT. FUNDING MECHANISMS THAT COULD YOU COULD YOU BE USE CONTINUE TO FUNDING OF IMPORTANT TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE. A WE JUST PASSED A EL HUNDRED NINE NINE BILLION DOLLAR -- BUDGET WITH LESS THAN. THREE IN THAT BUDGET THAT WILL GO TO ROAD [inaudible] INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SO IF OUR PRIORITIES AND IF EVERYONE AGREES. THAT TRANSPORTATION ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE IS A PRIORITY. THEN WE MUST MATCH THAT PRIORITY WITH FUNDING. AND SO IF LESS THAN 3% OF OUR FUNDING IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. IS GOING TO ROADS THEY'RE WE NEED TO ANSWER TO THE PUBLIC FOR THAT. AND SO THERE IS PROPOSITION TWO THE RAINY DAY FUND. IN THAT SENSE CLEARLY STATES THAT IF WE WANT TO SAVE ABOVE AND BEYOND THE RAINY DAY FUND THAT THAT FUNDING. WOULD GO TEMPERATURE AFTER THE FOLLOWING BUDGET YEAR. AND THIS LEGISLATURE CHOSE NOT TO PUT ANY MORE FUNDING INTO THE MADE A FINE UNDER PROP. TWO AND SO WE HAD THAT CHOICE AND WE DIDN'T MAKE THAT CHOICE AND SO. WE NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIRMEN IN HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS IS THAT WE NEED TO FUND INFRASTRUCTURE AND I THINK THAT WE PROBABLY NEED TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN INVESTED. ARE CURRENTLY I THINK MOST OF THE PROPONENTS ABOUT SIZA OPPONENTS AND PROPONENTS OF AS WE WANT I WOULD AGREE THAT WE NEED PUBLIC SHOULD BE SPENDING MORE ON INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SEES THE SAFETY AND AND A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS THAT WOULD NOT ONLY INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY BUT ALSO. A TO PROVIDE NEEDED INVESTMENTS TO REDUCE TRAFFIC CONGESTION SO I WOULD JUST ASK THAT AS WE DISCUSS LEARN THE FUTURE OF TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND TRANSMISSION INVESTMENT IS THAT THIS DISCUSSION DOESN'T END HERE. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY. THE PUBLIC WANTS A VOICE SO NOW WE AT THE WE ANSWERED TO THE PUBLIC. THE VOTERS ARE OUR BOSSES. AND SO WE DID IS WE DESERVEDLY NEED TO GIVE THE VOTERS A CHOICE ON WHETHER S. B. ONE IS TO CRACK POLICY NOT SO I THINK YOU APPRECIATE THE JENNIFER LET ME SPEAK. WHO I AM? ONE OTHER SPEAKER FROM THE THE DICE MISTER GIPSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PERSONALITY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS HEARING IN.

THE VOTERS IN MY DISTRICT PORTED. WE ARE SEEING THE MANIFESTATION OF S. B. ONE TAKING PLACE. BY INFRASTRUCTURE NO ROADS BEING. TAKING CARE BEING A REPAIRED -- PEOPLE ARE SAYING I CAN NOW DRIVE DOWN CENTRAL AVENUE. AND OTHER PARTS OF THE DISTRICT AS WELL AND SO I THINK THAT WE HAVE IN FACT HEARD. OF VOTERS -- CINNAMINSON CONCERNS -- BY DOING THIS I MISSED SOMETHING THAT I THINK THAT IS VERY WELL SUPPORTED. IT'S ALSO SOMETHING THAT THINK MAKE GOOD SENSE OF THE TESTIMONIES THAT I'VE HEARD THUS FAR TODAY FROM THE DIFFERENT CITIES WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF SB ONE GOES AWAY. IT WOULD BE DEVASTATING -- TO THE FOUR HUNDRED PLUS CITIES I'M WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY PRUDENT I THINK THIS IS BACK ZACH LEE WHAT. OF THE VOTERS OF OF CALIFORNIANS LISA MY DISTRICT I'M SUPPORT -- AND ONE AND I THINK IT'S BEEN ECHOED THOSE WHO REPRESENT THEM THEM THE DIFFERENT CITIES WHO HAVE COME HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS ON BEHALF OF THOSE PARTICULAR CITIES I THINK YOU.

FOR OF TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA [inaudible] AND TRAVELING THROUGHOUT THE STATE TALKING TO STAKEHOLDERS. ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD COMPROMISE A GOOD HOPEFULLY ó PACKAGE -- THAT WOULD ADDRESS ALL THE NEEDS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. OTHER IS A PERFECT NO. BUT THERE'S A TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BACKLOG IN REPAIRS THAT WE'RE NOT ACKNOWLEDGING AND THAT WHEN I SERVE ON THE CDC AS AN EX OFFICIO SENATOR BELL.

SIXTEEN NINE THE LOCK BOX WHICH WILL MAKE SURE THE DOLLARS ARE CONTINUALLY USE FOR TRANSPORTATION. OTHER TO STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO GIVE THE PUBLIC ASSURANCE THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN USE IT FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE. SO WITH THAT WILL ADJOURN THIS HEARING.
