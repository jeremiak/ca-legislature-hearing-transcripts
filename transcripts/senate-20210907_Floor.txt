SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE RESOLUTION FORTY SEVEN BY SENATOR BURGESS RELATIVE TO THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH SENATOR MELINDA'S. THANK YOU VERY MUCH LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ON THIS SATURDAY SEPTEMBER ELEVEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE OUR NATION WILL OBSERVE THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF AMERICA'S DARKEST DATING DOING SO WILL HONOR THE HEROES OF THE CASUALTIES OF THE MOST SHOCKING BARBARIC IN CATASTROPHIC ACT OF INHUMANITY AND MODERN HISTORY. THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY WILL SERVE TO RECALL THE UNITING OF THE WORLD'S CULTURES AND NATIONALITIES IN THE CONDEMNATION OF TERRORISM AND THE GREAT OUTPOURING OF CHARITY AND COMPASSION THAT FOLLOWED THE ATTACKS ON THE WORLD TRADE CENTER WHICH DEMONSTRATED ONCE AGAIN VICTORY OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT OVER DEPRAVITY SAVAGERY AND COWARDICE. TWENTY YEARS AGO ON SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH TWO THOUSAND ONE TERRORIST FOUR SEPARATE AIRLINE FLIGHTS CARRYING TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX PEOPLE ALL BOUND FOR CALIFORNIA. THESE ACTS OF TERRORISM BECAUSE THE DESTRUCTION OF. THE TWO PROMINENT WORLD TRADE CENTER TOWERS NEARBY BUILDINGS A PORTION OF THE PENTAGON BUILDING IN FOR AIRLINE JETS IN THE LOSS OF INNOCENT AMERICAN LIVES IN COUNTLESS INJURIES TO SO MANY OTHERS. OVER FOUR HUNDRED PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL GAVE THEIR LIVES IN RESPONSE TO THOSE EMERGENCIES. TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE ATTACKS CALIFORNIANS AMERICANS AND PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD CONTINUE TO MOURN THE TREMENDOUS LOSS OF INNOCENT LIFE ON THAT HISTORIC DAY. THESE ATTACKS WERE BY FAR THE DEADLIEST TERROR ATTACKS EVER LAUNCHED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES AND BY TARGETING THE SYMBOLS OF AMERICAN STRENGTH AND SUCCESS THEY WERE INTENDED TO ASSAIL THE PRINCIPLES VALUES AND FREEDOMS OF THE UNITED STATES AND OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO INTIMIDATE OUR NATION. AND WEAKEN OUR RESOLVE IT DID NOTHING OF THE KIND. AFTER TWENTY YEARS THE THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS OF CALIFORNIANS REMAIN WITH THE VICTIMS OF THE SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH TWO THOUSAND ONE ATTACKS. IN WITH THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES AND AS CALIFORNIANS WE JOIN THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IN POURING OUT THEIR HEARTS IN GRIEF AND SYMPATHY FOR THE FAMILY AND THE FRIENDS OF THOSE WHO PERISHED. OR SUFFERED INJURIES IN THE ATTACKS. WE SALUTE AND WE REMEMBER THE HUNDREDS OF HEROIC MEN AND WOMEN OF THE POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS PARAMEDICS AND MEDICAL PERSONNEL WHO PUT THEIR SAFETY AT RISK. AND LOSS OF THEIR LIVES WERE SERIOUSLY INJURED IN THEIR COURAGEOUS EFFORTS TO PROTECT AND SERVE THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS. WE SHOULD ALL BE ETERNALLY GRATEFUL TO THE VALIANT MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR ARMED FORCES THOSE WHO HAVE FALLEN. THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN WOUNDED AND THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO COMBAT TERRORISM AROUND THE WORLD. SO IT IS A FITTING POINT IN HISTORY FOR ALL AMERICANS TO REMIND THEMSELVES. THAT THE UNITED STATES IS A NATION OF HEALING OF HOPE AND RESILIENCE. A EXCUSE ME WE ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIANS TO HONOR THE MEMORY OF THOSE WHO DIED SERVING SEPTEMBER ELEVEN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH AN ACTIVE SERVICE TO THEIR FELLOW CALIFORNIANS WHETHER THAT'S DONATING BLOOD OR VISITING A NURSING YOU'RE BETTER IN TOWN OR VOLUNTEERING AT A HOSPITAL FOR SAYING THANK YOU TO A VETERAN WHO SERVED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN I ASK THAT WE NEVER FORGET THE SACRIFICES MADE ON SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH TWO THOUSAND ONE AND I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR MELINDA US. SENATOR NELSON. NOT A PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE SENATE. ON SUCH OCCASIONS WE ALWAYS MAKE A VALVE THAT WE WILL REMEMBER. OFTTIMES WE DON'T. BUT THIS IS ONE THAT WILL LIVE. AS ROOSEVELT SAID. ELEVEN ANTHONY. WHEN WE WERE ATTACKED PEARL HARBOR. THIS ONE WE'LL ALSO LIVE IN INFAMY BECAUSE WE WERE ATTACKED. ON OUR OWN SOIL. BY FOREIGN INFLUENCES. BENT ON HARMING US. AS MUCH AS VIOLENTLY AS THEY POSSIBLY COULD. THEY SUCCEEDED MAYBE TO A DEGREE AND BUT FOR A BRIEF TIME. BUT NOT IN DURING THE DAY. AMERICA HAS REMAINED STRONG. AND WE ALL OVER PLANET CAME FROM OUR HEARTS. THE SUPPORT THOSE WHO WERE LOST. YOUR LOVED ONES. AND OUR FELLOW AMERICANS. I FONDLY REMEMBER. ALL THE FLAGS THAT WERE IN FULL UNFURLED IN THE HOMES AND THE BUSINESSES. NO NOT CARS AND TRUCKS DRIVING AROUND AMERICA. H. AMERICAN MAKING ABOUT. THE WE DO REMEMBER WE WILL BE STRONG. WE WILL NOT BE DETERRED. IT'S SAD THAT THESE OCCASIONS POORER THAN LIFE AND OVER THE COURSE OF HISTORY. A LONG HALF. IT PROBABLY STILL WILL BE. BUT THE MARK THE NATION AND ITS PEOPLE. IS HOW WE INDOOR AND MOVE THROUGH AND MOVE ON FROM SUCH OCCASIONS. I GET PRETTY DISGUSTED QUITE OFTEN WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THINGS THAT I SEE GOING AROUND OUR COUNTRY. BUT AT SUCH MOMENTS OF THESE. IS WHEN THE TRUE HEART. AND SO OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHINE FORTH GLORIOUSLY. YES THOSE LOVED ONES ARE LOST. AND THEIR LOVED ONES ARE GRIEVING. ND WE- ALL THE REST OF US. STILL STAND WITH THEM AND STAND FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. OUR COUNTRY. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON SAID ARCHULETA.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. HELLO I THINK MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO FOR BRINGING FORWARD THIS. IMPORTANT RESOLUTION AS WE NEAR THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF NINE ELEVEN. I WAS A THIRD YEAR STUDENT IN LAW SCHOOL AT THAT TIME- IN THE BOSTON AREA AND MANY OF MY FRIENDS MY CLASSMATES LOST FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES. IN THOSE ATTACKS- AND I WANT TO HARKEN BACK TO THE CONTEXT OF NINE ELEVEN WE JUST HAD A CONTESTED ELECTION. A VERY CLOSE ELECTION- WE HAD A IT WAS DECIDED IF IN EFFECT BY BUSH V. GORE THE SUPREME COURT. HI GEORGE W. BUSH HAD TAKEN OFFICE- AND MANY WERE UPSET WITH SOME OF HIS POLICIES. BUT WHAT I VIVIDLY REMEMBER ABOUT NINE ELEVEN. HE SAID AFTER THAT ATTACK WE ALL UNITED BEHIND THE PRESIDENT THOSE OF US WHO AGREED WITH HIM. THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH HIM. WE RALLY BEHIND OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. WE RALLY BEHIND OUR MILITARY. AND WHILE MANY OF US MAY HAVE HAD MISGIVINGS ABOUT THE FOREIGN POLICY STEPS THAT WE TOOK GOING FORWARD. WE SUPPORTED THEM WE SUPPORTED OUR TROOPS. WE SUPPORTED OUR PRESIDENT WE SUPPORTED THE DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS THAT LED US TO THIS DECISIONS. IT WAS A MOMENT OF UNITY. AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE TWENTY YEARS LATER. WE SEE SO MUCH DIVISION. AND PARTISAN BICKERING TODAY. AND I HOPE THAT AS WE APPROACH THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF NINE ELEVEN WE CAN HARKEN BACK TO THAT SPIRIT OF UNITY THAT WE CAN HAVE FAITH IN OUR INSTITUTIONS. IN OUR DEMOCRACY THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT SUPPORT FOR PRESIDENT BIDEN FOR OUR TROOPS FOR OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AGAIN BECAUSE WHEN AMERICA IS UNITED AND TOGETHER. THERE'S NO GREATER COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD BUT WHEN WE ARE DIVIDED AS WE FIND OURSELVES TODAY- THAT IS I BELIEVE WHEN WE ARE IN PERILOUS TIMES SO I WANT TO THINK AGAIN MY COLLEAGUES FOR SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE I PERSON I VOTE. BUT ALSO WANT US TO YOU KNOW BE CAUTIOUS AND THOUGHTFUL ABOUT WHAT NINE ELEVEN SHOULD MEAN. IN THESE TIMES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU CENTERMAN SENATOR UMBERG. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES. EVERY PERSON ON THIS FLOOR REMEMBERS WHERE THEY WERE AND WHAT THEY DID ON NINE ELEVEN MUCH LIKE THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION THIS IS SOMETHING THAT STICKS WITH US AND WE'LL STICK WITH US FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES AND WE TELL OUR CHILDREN OUR GRANDCHILDREN. ABOUT NINE ELEVEN WHERE WE WERE AND WHAT WE DID. I HOPE ALL OF US. I TRUST ALL OF US WILL BE ABLE TO ALSO. TALK ABOUT HOW IT IMPACTED OUR LIVES AND WHAT WE DID. WHAT WE DID AS A CONSEQUENCE SOME MAY THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE ALL OF US MADE SOME SACRIFICE. BUT WHAT WE DID WHAT WE DID TO. ATTACKED SUPPORT EMBRACE THE FAMILIES OF THOSE WHO WERE IMPACTED. WHAT WE DID TO SUPPORT THOSE WHO ARE STILL FEELING THE IMPACTS IF YOU THINK IT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO AND THOSE IMPACTS ARE NO LONGER BEING FELT I ENCOURAGE YOU TO VISIT THE VA HOSPITAL. I ENCOURAGE YOU TO VISIT A VA HOSPITAL AND SEE THAT THAT SUFFERING THAT SACRIFICE IS STILL WITH US. AND IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CAN DO GOING FORWARD. I ASKED THAT WE REMEMBER THOSE WHO FOUGHT WITH US AND SHOULD BLOOD WITH US. IN AFGHANISTAN. BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE PLAYING MANY ARE COMING TO CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA HOUSES AND HAS THE LARGEST POPULATION OF AFGHANS OF ANY STATE IN THE UNION THAT WE REMEMBER THAT THAT THEY SERVE WITH US AND SACRIFICED WITH US. AND THAT WHEN WE TELL THE STORY TO OUR CHILDREN OUR GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT WHAT WE DID. ON NINE ELEVEN AND AFTER NINE ELEVEN WE CAN INCLUDE. SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT WE DID FOR THOSE WHO FOUGHT AND THOSE WHO FOUGHT WITH US THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER ON. S. S. R. FORTY SEVEN THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU SENATOR UMBERG SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE I ALSO STAND IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SR FORTY SEVEN AS MANY HAVE NOTED IT'S WAS ONE OF THOSE DAYS THAT WILL NEVER FORGET. IT REALLY WAS A SOMBER DAY FOR ALL OF US HERE IN OUR COUNTRY. BUT THE ONE THING THAT I DO RECALL IS THAT IN THAT DARKNESS THERE CAME LIGHT IMMUNITY. I REMEMBER EVERY SINGLE CAR WITH AN AMERICAN FLAG REMEMBER PEOPLE HAD SIGNS THAT READ WE STAND TOGETHER. AND WE WEREN'T DIVIDED BY. EITHER POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS OR OTHER IT WAS JUST ONE AMERICAN FAMILY. AND WE NEED TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON ALL THE PEOPLE WE LOST ON THAT DAY SO MANY FIRST RESPONDERS SO MANY FAMILIES. I PERSONALLY KNOW OF A FAMILY WHO GREW UP WITHOUT A MOTHER SHE HAPPENED TO BE IN ONE OF THE FLIGHTS. AND AS WE CONTINUE TO COMMEMORATE THE TWENTY FIFTH ANNIVERSARY WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WE NEED TO STAND TOGETHER. AND THE TIMES OF TRAGEDY AND I KNOW RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE GOING THROUGH SOME DARKNESS AND NO MATTER HOW HARD TIMES ARE. WE CONTINUE TO BE ONE AMERICAN FAMILY SO I ENCOURAGE US TO CONTINUE TO HONOR THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO BRAVELY HAVE FOUGHT. DURING THE TWENTY YEARS OF WAR FOR OUR FREEDOMS THOSE THAT ARE CURRENTLY STILL SERVING OVERSEAS. I HAPPEN TO BE A MILITARY FAMILY AS WELL AND MY FAMILY IS CURRENTLY. OVERSEAS SERVING AND SO I WANT TO JUST HONOR THOSE FALLEN I WANT TO HONOR THE VICTIMS AND THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND CONTINUE TO PRAISE THEM FOR WHAT THEY DID ON THAT DAY AND WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR SUPPORT FOR S. R. FORTY SEVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO SENATOR HERTZBERG. PRICES SUPPORTED THIS MEASURE THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM LAKE ELSINORE PRESENTING- CALLING FROM FRESNO AND WANT TO JOIN IN ON THE COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY SO MANY COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY. HE WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO. TWENTY YEARS AGO. I REMEMBER AS A COLLEAGUE FROM ST TALKED ABOUT WHERE WE YOU. I WAS JUST GETTING UP IN WILLIAMS LET'S SEE MY OFFICE CALLS ME AND SAYS TURN ON THE TV AS THE BUILDINGS ARE COMING DOWN. THE CHP TOLD US THAT WE WERE TARGET HERE AT THE STATE CAPITOL. AND ABANDONED ASKED US TO ABANDON THE BUILDING INSTANTANEOUSLY TWENTY YEARS AGO. THE GOVERNOR SET UP SHOP OUT AT THE CHP TRAINING CENTER. AND THE OTHER PART OF TOWN. AND IT WAS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY THAT WAS THE DAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE WAS INTENDING TO TAKE UP REDISTRICTING. THE SENATE SEATS ASSEMBLY SEES BOARD OF EQUALIZATION SEATS AND CONGRESSIONAL SEATS AND WE MISSED SESSION THE NEXT DAY AND OUR SHINY DIE FOR THAT TWO YEAR SESSION WAS SEPTEMBER THIRTEENTH TWO IS QUITE CHALLENGING WHICH SET UP SHOP ACROSS THE STREET IN TERMS OF HOW THE LEGISLATURE WORKED. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY PANDEMONIUM. THE IMPACT ON THIS BUILDING HAS BEEN ALL OF THE SECURITY MEASURES WHICH YOU SEE HERE TODAY. THE FENCE AROUND THE BUILDING THE MAGNETOMETERS WE HAVE AND SO MANY OTHER ASPECTS OF THE NEW POLICIES THAT WE HAVE. WENOW HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY ANTI TERRORISM- SYSTEM IN THE WORLD- DESPITE ALL THE THREATS THAT WE HEAR FROM SO MANY OF OUR FRIENDS OTHER ASPECTS OF GOVERNMENT. SO MANY OF THOSE HAVE BEEN QUASHED BY THE INCREDIBLE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE VARIOUS ANTI TERRORIST GROUPS THAT EXIST.ACROSS THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE OUR OWN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA. A HUNDRED MY OFFICE WHO USED TO WORK FOR ME AS A LIBRARY ASSISTANT MANY YEARS AGO WAS NOW OUR SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND WE CREATED THIS HOMELAND SECURITY OFFICE. TO INTEGRATE ALL OF THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT THEY DIDN'T TALK TO EACH OTHER. SO WHEN DO WE ALSO HAVE A TSA THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE THAT ONE COULD ARGUE ABOUT INCONVENIENCING US. WITH THOSE FOLKS WHO CAME TO THE SYSTEM WITH RAZOR BLADES AND ALL THE THINGS THAT THEY DID ORDER THE THOSE PLANES. HAVEN'T BEEN HAPPENING. SO INDEED THERE IS THE CAR COLLEAGUES HERE TALKED ABOUT THE EXTRAORDINARY HUMAN TOLL. BUT THE INGENUITY AND IMAGINATION CREATIVITY OF THIS COUNTRY AND OURGOVERNMENT. HAVE CREATED EXTRAORDINARY PROTECTIONS THAT OFTEN ARE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF AN INCONVENIENCE TO US BUT I THINK AS WE- LOOK AT A DAY LIKE TODAY. OR DAY TWENTY TWO RECOGNIZES S. C. S. R. FORTY SEVEN TALKS ABOUT RECOGNIZING. THE IMPACT OF NINE ELEVEN I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. I THINK HOW WE RESPONDED TO IT AND HOW SUCCESSFUL OUR GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN. IN STOPPING SO MANY CHALLENGES SO MANY POTENTIAL THREATS THAT HAVE- FACED US ACROSS THIS COUNTRY AND HOW WE REFORM OUR GOVERNMENT TO MAKE IT WORK BETTER. IN BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE TAXPAYERS AND PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES AND OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT AMONG ALL THE OTHER REASONS SUGGESTED BY THE COLLEAGUES HERE TODAY. TRANSACTION PORT OF SR FORTY SEVEN. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG CENTRE TORONTO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TO RISE SINCE IN SUPPORT. OF THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH. AND IN PARTICULAR TO OF COURSE APPRECIATE THE SACRIFICE IN THE LIVES OF MANY FIRST RESPONDERS. THE HEROES AND THOSE WHO WERE FIRST RESPONDERS BUT DIDN'T HAVE A TITLE AS A FIRST RESPONDER. THE THOUSANDS OF ACTS OF HEROISM. AMERICANS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE. HELPING ONE ANOTHER AMERICANS BORN IN OTHER COUNTRIES. AND I JUST WANT TO MENTION ONE PARTICULAR GROUP THAT WERE IMPACTED- IN THE NORTH TOWER OF THE WORLD TRADE CENTER AT THE VERY TOP WAS A RESTAURANT CALLED WINDOWS ON THE WORLD. THAT DAY THERE WERE SEVENTY TWO OUR RESTAURANT STAFF THAT WERE WORKING. MY UNION THE HOTEL AND RESTAURANT WORKERS ARE REPRESENTED THOSE EMPLOYEES- THEY ACTUALLY WERE A WINDOWS ON THE WORLD. THEY CAME FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. THE MAJORITY WERE NOT BORN HERE IN THE US. BUT THEY WERE WORKING AND SERVING THIS NATION JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. WE WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE VIDEO OF THE EMPLOYEES AT WORK HOW THEY WERE. COMRADES WITH EACH OTHER THEY WORKED TOGETHER FOR SO MANY YEARS THEY HAD A TREMENDOUS LEVEL OF SUPPORT FOR EACH OTHER THEIR FAMILIES FOR EACH OTHER THEY LOVE FOR EACH OTHER. ALL SEVENTY TWO OF COURSE WERE WORKING THAT DAY WERE KILLED WE PRODUCED A FILM TO TELL THEIR STORIES. TO PRESERVE THEIR EXPERIENCES AS IMMIGRANT AMERICANS SO TO ALL THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES ALL THOSE WHO PERFORMED ACTS OF HEROISM OF. REMEMBER THE DAY AND I. WAS JUST. A COUPLE YEARS WE HAD OUR FIRST CHILD AND I REMEMBER THE STORIES FROM MY- UNCLES AND MY FATHER ABOUT. WHEN PEARL HARBOR WAS ATTACKED AND THERE'S MEMORY. AND IT WAS THAT MOMENT I REALIZE THIS IS A MEMORY THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET. WHAT HAPPENED ON SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH SO I JUST WANTED TO ALSO SAY WHICH HAS BEEN SAID MANY TIMES ON THIS FLOOR TODAY THAT WE WILL NEVER FORGET THE PEOPLE WHO. PUT THEIR LIVES TO THE FIRST RESPONDERS WHO WERE GOING TO THE ACTION WHEN PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO LEAVE. AND GET TO SAFETY IT WAS JUST IT'S BURNED IN MY MEMORY OF THOSE TOWERS COMING DOWN AND THAT ON OUR OWN SOILS. WE WERE ATTACKED- I JUST WANT TO SAY THE COOL THING THAT I REMEMBER THEY CAME OUT OF IT WAS IT DIDN'T MATTER. WHAT POLITICAL VIEW YOU ARE FROM. WE WERE ALL AMERICANS IN THE SAME BOAT. AND WE STAND FOR OUR COUNTRY AND FOR THOSE WHO SACRIFICED WELL WE WANT TO REMEMBER THAT DAY AND I WILL NEVER FORGET THANK YOU FOR BRINGING SR FORTY SEVEN- TO THIS FLOOR AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY AS WELL. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY SENATOR PAM. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS I TO A RISE IN SUPPORT OF S. R. FORTY SEVEN AND- CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. MAKE COLLEAGUES HERE TALKING ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES I REMEMBER. BEING WOKEN UP BY PHONE CALL ACTUALLY. MY BROTHER WHO LIVED IN DC- CALLED AND SAID YOU NEED TO TURN ON THE TV- BECAUSE- NOT ONLY OF COURSE WE HAVE THE TWIN TOWERS CAME DOWN THE PLANE THAT FLEW INTO THE PENTAGON AS WELL AS COURSE THE PLANE. THAT WAS DOWNED IN PENNSYLVANIA. YEAH AND I THINK THAT CERTAINLY IS WE REMEMBER THAT DAY. AND THE HEROISM OF THE FIRST RESPONDERS AND OTHERS- THAT DAY. I HOPE THAT WE ALSO- AND PEOPLE REFERRED TO THIS- ALSO REMEMBERED- THAT THE UNITY OF OUR COUNTRY OUR PRESIDENT- PRESIDENT BUSH- ACTUALLY CALLING BE SURE THAT. WE DO NOT AT LEAST AT THAT POINT TIME TRIED TO- TO VIGILANT EYES ARE- BLAME MUSLIMS FOR THIS ATTACK ON OUR COUNTRY. THAT WE WERE ALL AMERICANS NO MATTER WHAT OUR FAITH OUR POLITICS. ASSIGNMENT THEN FORTUNATELY DID NOT LAST BUT AT LEAST IMMEDIATELY AFTER. I HELD AND- THAT KIND OF LEADERSHIP. AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT- THESE KINDS OF A TRAGIC EVENTS AND FOR EXAMPLE IS ALSO REFERENCE THAT- IN RESPONSE OUR COUNTRY HAD TO TAKE STEPS TO TRY TO PROTECT ITSELF- YEAH WE HAD- REFUTED AIRPORT YOU HAD TO GO AND YELL TO METAL DETECTORS AND- SO FORTH. WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE SITTING OUT THERE PROTESTING AIRPORT SAYING THAT WHITE PEOPLE TAKING MY FREEDOM TO GO INTO THE AIRPORT- YOU HAD A NOW NO FLY LIST NOW I THINK THERE'S SOME DEBATE AS TO HOW EFFECTIVE THAT WAS- BUT- YOU KNOW YOU HAD PEOPLE WHO HAD TO GET JACKSON ORDERED JUST FINE WE DIDN'T. WELL CERTAINLY SOME PEOPLE THERE PERHAPS SOME JUSTICE IN THERE BUT PEOPLE DIDN'T O AND PROTEST OUTSIDE OF AIRPORTS ARE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OFFICES ARE SCREENED. AND AT ELECTED OFFICIALS- FOR AGAIN TAKING AWAY. AGAIN FOR THOSE ACTIONS. AND I HOPE THAT AS WE REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED- BACK ON- NINE ELEVEN. THAT WE OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING TODAY AND HOW WE CAN COME TOGETHER AS A COUNTRY. AND LOOK AT THE FACTS I SHOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE OF THAT AND FORTY DARK CONSPIRACY THEORIES ABOUT. NINE ELEVEN. THEY'RE STILL OUT THERE. HIS HAVE THINGS ON SOCIAL. THAT CLAIM THAT NEVER HAPPENED. R. AS A CONSPIRACY. AND THERE EVEN SOME POLITICIANS TODAY- FOR EXAMPLE- CONGRESSWOMAN MARJORIE KELLY GREEN TWO YEARS AGO- ACTUALLY- TRIED FOR PERJURY THIS CONSPIRACY THEORIES AND THAT IS NOT HOW WE SHOULD BE MAKING POLICY DECISIONS BASED ON CONSPIRACY THEORIES BUT ON FACTS. AND SO AS WE CONFRONT THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE TODAY HOPEFULLY WE WILL LOOK AT THE FACTS WE WILL COME TOGETHER AS A COUNTRY TO TRY TO PROTECT OUR MUTUAL SECURITY AND SAFETY AND THAT THE HISTORY OF- ARE MEMBERS OF NINE ELEVEN WILL HELP GUIDE US IN HOW OUR COUNTRY. SHOULD TRY TO COME TOGETHER AND- ACTOR SELVES AGAINST THREATS AGAINST US SO AGAIN I- SPECIALLY ASK FOR SUPPORT FOR S. R. FORTY SEVEN AND- HOPE WE CAN REFLECT ON THE LESSONS THAT IT- BRINGS US THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAM MADAM HOTEL. AND PRESIDENT- I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THERE WILL BE SUPPORT FOR S. R. FORTY SEVEN TODAY. AND I RECOGNIZE THAT- THIS IS FOUR DAYS UNTIL WE ADJOURN- BUT I THINK IT IS REALLY MOST APPROPRIATE. THAT WE TAKE THE TIME TODAY. TO HONOR THE STORIES THAT THOSE OF YOU HAVE SHARED TODAY THOSE THAT WE'VE HEARD OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. THE DOCUMENTARIES THE MOVIES THE REPORT- IT'S SO MUCH THAT WE FEEL IN OUR HEARTS NOT JUST- THAT WE'VE WITNESSED OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY PROFOUND COMMENTS OR REMARKS AT THIS MOMENT EXCEPT THAT I THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE THE TIME- AND THE STORIES REALLY DO MATTER I THINK THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING MOST OF US TO- TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY WHO SAID WE ALWAYS. REMEMBER WHERE WE WERE. IT WAS EARLY MORNING MOST OF US DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS UNFOLDING BEFORE US EVEN AS WE HEARD THE STORIES. I WAS ON MY WAY FROM MY EARLY MORNING BUSINESS ASSOCIATION MEETING AS A AS A NEW COUNCIL MEMBER. AND I KNEW THAT MY US MIGHT. LATER TO BECOME SPOUSE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ON A PLANE THAT MORNING. SO I DIDN'T KNOW ALLIED EXCEPT I KNEW THAT SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ON A PLANE AND SO. WE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF CELL PHONES THAT DAY SO I HAD TO PULL OVER. ON EL CAJON BOULEVARD IN SAN DIEGO TO FIND A PAY PHONE. TO TRY AND CALL AND MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS NOT HEADED TO THE AIRPORT THOSE STORIES. AND THEN TO FEEL SO FORTUNATE LATER. BUT SHE WAS NOT ON A PLANE. BUT SO MANY PEOPLE WERE- WE REMEMBER THE MEMORIES THE THOUGHTS THE EMOTIONS ARE SO VIVID EVEN TODAY TO THOSE OF US ARE LISTENING TO YOUR STORIES. OF WHERE YOU WERE AND WHAT YOU REMEMBER AND HOW YOU TOOK IT IN- WE REMEMBER THE BRAVERY THE HUMANITY OF THOSE PASSENGERS ON FLIGHT NINETY THREE WHO SAVE THE LIVES OF COUNTLESS PEOPLE IN THE U. S. CAPITOL. OTHER SHRINE OF OUR DEMOCRACY. I REMEMBER THE BRAVERY IN THE HUMANITY OF ALL THOSE WHO RAN INTO THE TOWERS ARE FIRST RESPONDERS IN THE STORIES THAT CAME OUT AFTER THAT. THOSE WHO MIRACULOUSLY MADE IT OUT. AND OF COURSE THOSE WHO DID NOT. I REMEMBER THE SICK FEELING THAT WE HAD ONE STILL REELING IN TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE GRIEF AND ANGER TO LEARN. THAT A BRIEF PART OF THE TERRORISTS PREPARATIONS TOOK PLACE IN MY OWN CITY OF SAN DIEGO. YOU'VE HEARD ME LIKE MANY OF YOU SO PROUD OF THE PEOPLE ON THIS FLOOR- WHO TALK ABOUT THEIR MILITARY SERVICE IN THEIR MILITARY HISTORY. OF MY FAMILY'S MILITARY SERVICE- I AIN'T HAD A NEPHEW WHO SOON WENT OFF TO IRAQ AFTER. NINE ELEVEN I HAVE A NEPHEW STILL SERVING TODAY. I REMEMBER THE TALK ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE MILITARY PERSONNEL AND INSTALLATIONS. THAT I REPRESENT IN SAN DIEGO. I OF COURSE REMEMBER THE LOSS AND SACRIFICES THAT SO MANY OF OUR MILITARY FAMILIES HAVE BEEN DURING THESE LAST TWENTY YEARS. AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY POIGNANT AS WE MOURN OUR RECENT LOSS OF THIRTEEN MARINES IN AFGHANISTAN AND JUST A WEEK OR SO AGO FIVE SAILORS OFF THE COAST OF SAN DIEGO. I WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO THE COLLEAGUES FOR SPEAKING ON THIS RESOLUTION BECAUSE IT IS US THAT KEEPS THE MEMORY. IT IS US THAT RECOGNIZES THE LEGACY AND THE FABRIC IN HELL THIS IS WOVEN INTO THE HISTORY. MUCH LIKE MY COLLEAGUE FROM BIEBER MENTIONED ABOUT WORLD WAR TWO. ARE THESE THOUGHTS AND MEMORIES REALLY MATTER. FOR US TO TAKE IT FORWARD AND NOT FORGET. TERRORISM FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC HAS NO PLACE IN OUR SOCIETY ARE IN OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT. ERICA WITH OUR FLAWS BUT ALSO WITH OUR BRAVERY AND HUMANITY HAS BEEN IS AND WILL BE A BEACON FOR PEOPLE. OF THE WORLD. SO REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH AND THOSE LOVED AND LOST IS AN IMPORTANT WAY FOR US TO KEEP THAT BEACON FROM BURNING OUT THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU MAN PRO TEM SEEING NO FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SENATOR MELINDA'S YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M CALLING SOMEONE I THINK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS- AND SHARING. YOUR EXPERIENCE IN REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH I THINK IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT THAT WE ENSURE WE WERE TEACHING OUR YOUTH ABOUT THE TRAGIC EVENTS OF THAT DAY- IF YOU DON'T REALIZE THAT THE LAST GENERATION OF KIDS WHO WERE ALIVE DURING THAT TIME HAVE NOW GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL- WHICH INCLUDES A COUPLE OF MY OWN CHILDREN. SO I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE AND ALWAYS REMEMBERS THAT SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH IS FOR THIS COUNTRY'S A HALLOWED DAY IN OUR HISTORY IT IS A DAY THAT WE REMEMBER THOSE WHO PERISHED THOSE WHO CONTINUE TO SUFFER TODAY THE EFFECTS- OF WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY THOSE WHO WENT ON TO TRY TO COMBAT THE FORCES THAT WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE ACTS AND KEEP THEM FERMENT ONCE AGAIN COMING TO AMERICAN SOIL- THAT'S WHAT S. R. FORTY SEVEN IS ABOUT AND THAT'S WHAT. OUR COMMEMORATION OF SEPTEMBER ELEVENTH IS ABOUT IS IT NOT A TIME TO OPINE ABOUT AN ELECTION THAT WAS OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO OR- THE EVENTS OF AUGUST TWENTY SIXTH OF THIS YEAR IT IS TO HONOR THE MEMORY.

AND ENSURE THE EVENTUAL EVACUATION OF OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AMERICANS. AFGHANS AND OTHER FOREIGN NATIONALS. MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN SEEKING TO ESCAPE FROM THOSE WHO WOULD DO THEM HARM. IT WAS CALLED OPERATION FREEDOM'S SENTINEL. THOSE BRAVE SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN PATROLLING THE WIRE THAT DAY THE WIRE AT THE ABBEY GATE TO THAT AIRPORT. DID NOT QUESTION WHY THEY WERE THERE OR THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THEIR DEPLOYMENT. THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO THEY KNEW THE ANSWER. THE COUNTRY NEEDED THEM. ITS PRINCIPAL OF DEVOTION TO DUTY WITHOUT REGARD TO ONE'S COMFORT TOWARDS SAFETY THE CONCEPTS OF PERSONAL COURAGE AND SELFLESS SERVICE ARE WHAT CHARACTERIZE OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM AS THEY KEEP US SAFE. ALWAYS HAVE. ALWAYS WILL. EVEN ON AUGUST TWENTY SIX WHEN SOME WESTERN GOVERNMENTS WARNED THEIR CITIZENS CITIZENS TRYING TO ESCAPE FROM AFGHANISTAN TO STAY AWAY FROM THE AIRPORT THAT DAY. THOSE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN PATROLLING THE WORD DIDN'T LEAVE THEIR POSTS. BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T DO THAT HOWEVER. SO THAT SAME DAY AT ABOUT EIGHTEEN HUNDRED HOURS AT SIX PM LOCAL TIME THERE. AS THEY CONTINUE TO STAND WATCH AT THE ABBEY GATE PROTECTING OTHERS AND TRYING TO KEEP THEM SAFE. AS YOU KNOW A POWERFUL TERRORIST BOMB BLAST ROCKED THAT GATE. FILLING NEARLY TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE AND WOUNDING COUNTLESS OTHERS. INCLUDED IN THOSE TRAGICALLY KILLED WERE THIRTEEN BRAVE US SERVICE MEN AND WOMEN.

I DON'T BLAME THEM. HIS CLASSMATES COMMUNITY FRIENDS TEACHERS AND OTHERS DESCRIBED HIM AS A LEADER. WITH A BIG HEART AS CARING AND COMPASSION THAT IS SUPER CONFIDENT IN EVERYTHING HE DID. AS CHARISMATIC. ALTHOUGH LANCE CORPORAL MCCURRY WAS ONLY WITH US ON THIS EARTH FOR TWENTY VERY VERY SHORT YEARS HE CLEARLY LEFT AN INDELIBLE MARK ON HIS COMMUNITY AND THOSE WITH WHOM HE INTERACTED. AS THE NEWS OF HIS TRAGIC DEATH SPREAD ACROSS HIS COMMUNITY AND OUR REGION AND THE STATE. THE IMPACT OF HIS LIFE AND HIS DEATH TRULY HIT HOME. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS GATHER TO HONOR HIM WITH VARIOUS MEMORIAL GATHERINGS WITH A HIKE. WITH A SALUTE TO HIS MIRROR MEMORY. CLEARLY HE MADE A DIFFERENCE.

THEY JUST SHOW UP SALUTE SMARTLY AND PERFORM THEIR DUTY TO THE BEST OF THEIR ABILITY. AND THEN SOME. DAY AFTER DAY NIGHT AFTER NIGHT REGARDLESS OF THE THREAT OF DANGER TO THEMSELVES. OR TO OTHERS. THEY REPRESENT THE BEST OF US. LANCE CORPORAL MIKKO E. REPRESENTED THE BEST OF US.

FOR NEW AND EXISTING NURSING PROGRAMS TO HELP FORECAST AND PROJECTED MANNED AND AVAILABILITY OF CLINICAL PLACEMENT SLOTS FOR NURSING STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE.

ASSEMBLY BILL FOUR THIRTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER RAY AS AN ACT RELATING TO SCHOOL EMPLOYEES SENATOR HERTZBERG. THEY EVEN PRESIDENT THERE ARE MAJOR STATUTORY INEQUITIES. IN SCHOOL LAYOFF PROTECTIONS IN HEARING RIGHTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS MEASURE IS TO STANDARDIZE THE LAYOFF PROCESS IS SO THAT CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES WILL RECEIVE THE SAME LAYOFF NOTICE AND HEARING RIGHTS AS TEACHERS AND CERTIFICATED ADMINISTRATORS. WITH INSURERS THAT THERE'S THESE NOTICES EXIST IN EQUITY IN THE PROCESS THAT'S THE REASON THE BILLS HERE THAT'S THE REASON I'M STANDING UP AND THAT'S THE REASON I'M ASKING YOU FOR NOT A VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG MEMBERS ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SENATOR CHOKE. MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE FOUR THIRTY EIGHT THIS MEASURE ALTHOUGH WELL INTENDED SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAIL THE ABILITY OF LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS TO MAKE LOCALLY INFORMED AND ACCURATE BUDGET DECISIONS IT DOES THIS BY ELIMINATING THIS EXISTING SIXTY DAY LAYOFF NOTICE REQUIREMENT FOR CLASSIFIED SCHOOL STAFF IN A LINE TO TODAY IN MOVABLE DATE OF MARCH FIFTEENTH. JUST LIKE ANY OTHER EMPLOYER PERSONAL COSTS MAKE UP 8290% OF A SCHOOL DISTRICT'S BUDGET AS A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I'M GREATLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES THIS WILL HAVE ON LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS SCHOOL BOARDS. IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE STATE BUDGET. BY MANDATING SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ACT UPON NEARLY 90% OF ITS BUDGET THREE MONTHS BEFORE STATE BUDGET IS ADOPTED. IT WOULD ALSO RESTRICT FUTURE LEGISLATURES BY MANDATING THAT ANY FUTURE NOTICING RIGHT. PROVIDED TO TEACHERS WOULD AUTOMATICALLY EXTEND IT TO CLASSIFIED STAFF REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE RIGHT OR APPROPRIATE OR BENEFICIAL TO CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. LASTLY IT ALSO COMES AT A TIME WHEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS BOTH LARGE AND SMALL ENTER THE TESTING WINDOW. WHICH IS ALREADY A CHALLENGING TIME FOR EACH OF YOUR FOR STUDENTS TEACHERS AND STAFF. THIS WILL UNNECESSARILY INCREASE THE DISRUPTION AND UNCERTAINTY THAT ALREADY EXISTS WITH THE MARCH FIFTEENTH DEADLINE. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS WERE ALREADY FACING DIFFICULT CHALLENGES DECLINING ENROLLMENT THE STATE'S LONG TERM PROJECTED BUDGET DEFICIT. INCREASING PENSION COSTS AND OTHER FISCAL IMPACTS. I UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE TO HAVE A DATE CERTAIN LAW WHEN IT COMES TO LAYING OFF NOTICING. HOWEVER THIS BILL ALIGNS IT TO AN UNWORKABLE AND HIGHLY PROBLEM PROBLEMATIC DATE THEY WILL DO MORE HARM THAN GOOD. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR CHOKE MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I REALLY DID STRUGGLE TO STAND UP AND SPEAK ON THIS BILL. AS THE ONLY TEACHER ON THE FLOOR. AS THE ONLY MEMBER OF THIS BODY THAT'S RECEIVED A PINK SLIP. AS THE ONLY MEMBER OF THIS BODY HAD THAT HAS GIVEN PINK SLIPS ON THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE. I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. I REMEMBER HOW DRAMATIC IT IS. EVERY MARCH FIFTEENTH WHEN YOU ARE PAYING SLIPPED. THE DEPRESSION THAT COMES UPON YOUR SCHOOL COMMUNITY. HOW TEACHERS ARE WALKING AROUND SAD WITH LONG FACES AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO AS A TEACHER SUPPORTING OTHER TEACHERS. AND AS AN ADMINISTRATOR TRYING TO SUPPORT YOUR TEACHERS IT IS SOMETHING THAT'S NOT EASY FOR ANYONE. AND I DON'T OPPOSE ANYTHING IN THIS BILL IN TERMS OF EQUITY I THINK THAT CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES SHOULD HAVE THAT EQUITY. WHAT I TAKE ISSUE WITH THIS BUT NOTICE DATE. I THINK MARCH FIFTEENTH IS SO EARLY TO TRY AND NOTICE PEOPLE. ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR BUDGET IS. WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF OVER THANKS FOR LETTING PEOPLE. AND THOSE FAMILIES THAT REALLY DEPEND ON THIS. JOB TO PULL THROUGH THIS EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER. THAT I'VE HAD TO ENTER AS A TEACHER I HAVE. HOLD A LOT OF MY CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. AS WELL AS TEACHERS JUST TO GET THEIR INPUT. BECAUSE I KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN OUT OF THE CLASSROOM FOR A FEW YEARS JUST TO SEE WHERE THEY STAND AND HOW THEY FEEL. AND THEY WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE. THE DAY JUST BE PUSHED A LITTLE FURTHER I KNOW THAT THE DATE I BELIEVE IT WAS MARCH WAS OFFERED AND WAS REJECTED. AND FOR ME HAVING A DISTRICT THAT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT THEIR BUDGET IS IT'S JUST GOING TO ENCOURAGE THE OVERPAYING SLIPPING OF OUR TEACHERS I'M SORRY ARE ARE CLASSIFIED. AND IT'S NOT AN EASY THING TO DO. NOT IN MARCH FIFTEEN WE USED TO HAVE THREE POTENTIAL THREE MONTHS TO GOAL. AND OUR CHILDREN ARE DEPENDING ON THESE TEACHERS AND CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES TO CARRY THEM THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR. AGAIN I'M IN COMPLETE SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IF THE DATE WOULD BE MAY. AT LEAST ONE A MAY REVISE COMES AROUND SO YOU'RE NOT AGAIN. GIVEN THESE PINK SLIPS JUST BECAUSE THE DISTRICT HAS TO PROTECT ITSELF. TO US IT MAY BE EASY BUT SOMEONE LOCAL. I. LOW WAGE EARNER IN OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITY THEY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS EVERY YEAR JUST BECAUSE WE SET UP THE SYSTEM. WHERE THEY NEED TO BE NOTIFIED I THINK IT REALLY IS HEARTBREAKING. AND I JUST FEEL THAT I DON'T WANT TO PUT. OUR CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES AND THE EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER THAT I HAD TO ENTER. AS A TEACHER. AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GIVE. THE DISTRICT A LITTLE MORE TIME SO THEY'RE NOT JUST OVERPAYING FLIPPING. THAT THEY KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THESE EMPLOYEES. BUT I WILL BE VERY CLEAR I AGREE WITH EVERY. PIECE OF. SECTIONS IN THESE IN THIS BILL I'M NOT OPPOSING THE BILL I JUST A POST THE DATE. AND FOR THESE REASONS I'M GONNA HAVE TO STAFF TODAY THANK YOU.THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO SAID ROTH. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT YOU KNOW BEFORE I TOOK A- THIS JOB IF WE CALL THEM JOBS AND- BATTLING THE HOLES OF THIS PLACE- MEETING WITH PEOPLE TO. TRY TO BUT JUST WHAT MY COLLEAGUE JUST SPOKE ABOUT WHICH IS THE ARTIFICIAL DATE OF MARCH AT WHICH POINT SCHOOL BOARDS DISTRICTS. AND OTHERS HAVE TO PROVIDE THAT PINK SLIP TO TEACHERS SORT OF ARTIFICIAL IN THE SENSE THAT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BUT WE'RE TELLING YOU YOU'RE GOING TO BE LAID OFF BUT- YOU MAY NOT BE BUT YOU KNOW. IT'LL BE AWHILE BEFORE WE FIGURED OUT. WE WERE UNSUCCESSFUL IN TRYING TO BRING ABOUT REFORM. OBVIOUSLY SOME DON'T WANT REFORM AND THAT'S FINE BUT IN LOOKING AT THIS BILL I'M SORT OF CONFLICTED BECAUSE I DO AGREE THAT THE MARCH DATE NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED AND PUTS A BURDEN ON OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OUR SCHOOL BOARDS AROUND THE STATE- I HAVEN'T THOUGHT THROUGH WHAT THE VARIOUS ISSUES ARE I'M SURE THEY'RE MANY AND I'M SURE IF WE EVER GET AROUND TO IT HERE. WE WILL EXPLORE THOSE FULLY. BUT WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT THE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE NOT TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS. DON'T HAVE THE PROTECTIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BUILT INTO THE LAW. HOWEVER ARTIFICIAL THAT DATE IS THEY DON'T GET THE PINK SLIP WITH PLENTY OF NOTICE. HOWEVER DEPRESSING THAT MAY BE AN UPSETTING. THEY ALSO HAVE HEARING RIGHTS AS I RECALL AS PART OF THE PROCESS AN HOUR. OTHER NON TEACHER NOT ADMINISTRATOR EMPLOYEES HAVE NO HEARING RIGHTS AND SO WHAT BOTHERS ME ABOUT THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS THAT IT'S COMPLETELY INEQUITABLE. AND CERTAINLY THE LOWEST PAID. AMONG THE HARDEST WORKING. WE'RE CERTAINLY WORKING AS HARD AS THE OTHER EMPLOYEES IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE ARE THESE OTHER EMPLOYEES AND WHY NOT PROVIDE THEM THE SAME PROTECTION THAT WE PROVIDE THE TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS AND IF THE DATE NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED BECAUSE IT'S ARTIFICIAL ROOT CAUSES PEOPLE TO BE UPSET OR DEPRESSED AS IT WOULD. AND SHOULD I'M SURE. THEN LET'S DO THAT BUT I HAVE DECIDED EVEN THOUGH I WAS. CORN I'VE DECIDED TO COME DOWN IN FAVOR OF SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE WHO WORK VERY VERY HARD ENTER AT THE LOWER END OF THE PAY SCALE IN JUST ABOUT EVERY IF NOT EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH SENATOR GLAZER. THANK YOU I'M OUT OF PRESIDENT MEMBERS I. I RISE TO- TO JOIN IN THE- THE ARTICULATE COMMENTS FROM THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES WHO SPOKE EARLIER. ON ISSUES LIKE THIS HAVING EACH OF US I THINK TRY TO PUT OURSELVES IN THE PLACE. OF THE EMPLOYEE IN THIS CASE THE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE AND IT WOULD THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME- WOULD I WANT TO HAVE THIS NOTICE AND CERTAINLY THE ANSWER IS YES- BUT ON THE OTHER HAND YOU THINK ABOUT IT FROM A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER AND MANY MEMBERS ON THE FLOOR HAD BEEN SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS. AND YOU THINK ABOUT THE DILEMMA THEY FACE WHEN THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE THEIR BUDGET YET UNTIL. JULY FIRST AND THEY'RE FORCED TO MAKE A CHOICE. THAT WE'VE GOT TO GIVE NOTICE IN MARCH FOR SOMETHING IN WHICH IT'S SO DIFFICULT TO HAVE. A REAL UNDERSTANDING OF THAT BUDGET. AND SO FOR ME I WANT AT LEAST EXPLAIN WHY THE- TODAY DID NOT SUPPORT THIS BILL. IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME PROTECTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES. WHETHER IT'S TEACHERS OR CLASSIFIED STAFF ANDI THINK THAT. IF THIS BILL IS SO CLOSE TO BEING WHERE IT SHOULD BE. BUT THE DATE I THINK IS TO REJECT THEM DOES IT MEAN WE SHOULD EXAMINE IT FOR. FOR EVERYONE I'M OPEN TO THAT I THINK THAT. WE HAVE TO BE REALITIC AND WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE THESE MORALE PROBLEMS WHICH CURRENT LAW DOES PROVIDE. FOR THE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS WHO HAVE TO BE FORCED TO. GIVE THESE NOTICES AND TO THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES AND IN THIS CASE. OF THIS BILL THE CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES. TO CREATE THAT SORT OF MORALE PROBLEM BECAUSE- THEY'RE GOING TO THE SCHOOL BOARD'S GONNA ERR ON THE SIDE. OF HAVING TO PROTECT THE DISTRICT WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE TO SEND OUT MORE NOTICES THAT IS REQUIRED. SO THAT THIS BILL HAS THE BEST OF INTENTIONS. I DO THINK THERE'S A GOOD EQUITY ARGUMENT. FOR CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES AND TEACHERS. BUT THE STATE IS NOT A WORKABLE DATE MY FRIENDS. AND THEREFORE RELUCTANTLY I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZER SENATOR CORTESE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE. IN SUPPORT OF A. BEFORE THIRTY EIGHT AND A ONE OF A SOCIALLY MY COMMENTS WITH. MY COLLEAGUE FROM RIVERSIDE- IT WITHOUT REPEATING A LOT OF WHAT HE SAID- I'VE BEEN HERE- THROUGH ALMOST ONE FULL. SESSION AT LEAST THE FIRST YEAR OF ONE WHAT I'VE LEARNED. I THINK. ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE ATTEMPT TO. RECTIFY AND CHANGE. IS THAT. YOU HAVE TO. TO TAKE THEM ONE STEP AT A TIME IN THE STEP THAT WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE TODAY IS PARITY. I THINK- IN DEFENSE OF THE AUTHOR. AND OTHERS WHO HAVE WORKED ON THIS BILL. OPENING UP THE DATE. WHICH I TOO BELIEVE IS A PROBLEM. WHICH IS WHY I ASSOCIATED. MY COMMENT SO WITH MY COLLEAGUE- AND OTHERS WHO WERE BROUGHT UP THAT ISSUE- INCLUDING THE MY COLLEAGUE FROM CONTRA COSTA. IT IS A PROBLEM. BUT IT INVOLVES. A WHOLE. OTHER SET OF EXTENDED STAKE HOLDERS. OF THE FRANKLY WOULD HAVE. COMPLICATED THIS SINGULAR ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT WE SHOULD HAVE PARITY. RIGHT NOW ALL. OF FOR ALL EMPLOYEES INCLUDING CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES SO. I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SITTING IN HEARING NONE SENATOR HERTZBERG PLEASE CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. MEMBER FROM BALDWIN PARK IN YUCAIPA SAN JOSE IN RIVERSIDE AND. CONTRA COSTA SORRY ABOUT THAT- PRECIADO DISCUSSION AND I DO UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE OF THE EARLY DAY. BUT THE INTENT AND PURPOSE. AND MEANING OF THIS MEASURE BEFORE US TODAY. IS NOT ABOUT WHETHER THE DATE SHOULD BE CHANGED OR NOT CHANGED. BUT I THINK AS WAS INDICATED BY THE SENATOR FROM GENERAL FROM RIVERSIDE. BUT THESE WORKERS TODAY NOT HAVE SHOULD NOT HAVE THE SAME RIGHTS I THINK THAT THE- SCHOOLS ARE AN ORGANISM OF PEOPLE FROM ALL DIFFERENT JOBS FROM TEACHERS AND CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES ALL OF WHOM MAKE UP. THE EXPERIENCE AND TO HAVE THESE FOLKS BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY IF SOMEONE WANTS TO HAVE THE DEBATE WHICH IS NOT THIS MEASURE ON WHAT THE MARCH FIFTEENTH MAY FIFTEENTH WHAT THOSE STATES SHOULD BE. I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE TREATED EQUALLY AND FAIRLY BUT THESE HARD WORKERS SHOULD BE IN A POSITION THAT THEY'RE NOT TREATED IN A DIFFERENT MANNER. TO ME IS THE ESSENCE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN THIS MEASURE AND THE LAST POINT I WANT TO RAISE WITH RESPECT THE BUDGETING. AGAIN IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE. BUDGETING YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF YOUR- WORKERS ARE PART OF THE BUDGETING PROCESS AND YOU DON'T HAVE. ONE SET OF RULES APPLY. TO ONE GROUP AND ANOTHER SIDE TO THE OTHER SO I WOULD SUGGEST. THIS ACTUALLY MAKES IT EASIER AND FOR THOSE REASONS I WOULD ASK FOR AN IPHONE. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG MA'AM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALAN ARCHULETA. HI AT KINS. HI BABES. NO BACKER.
