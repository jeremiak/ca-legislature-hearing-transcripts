HAVE SOME VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS --

00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:15.719
BUT I I WOULD LIKE TO START BY

00:44:15.786 --> 00:44:17.321
SAYING THAT SEEMED YOU SEE WE

00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:18.689

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:20.891
VERY EFFECTIVE TOOL --

00:44:20.958 --> 00:44:22.726
IT'S BEEN USED GIANT THROUGHOUT

00:44:22.793 --> 00:44:23.594
THE STATE AND THROUGHOUT THE

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.696
COUNTRY AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO

TIME AND AND ON BUDGET --

00:44:31.468 --> 00:44:32.436
THERE IS SOMETHING HOWEVER

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:34.071
UNIQUE TO THIS PARTICULAR

00:44:34.138 --> 00:44:35.739
AUTHORITY METROLINK IS AN

00:44:35.806 --> 00:44:37.207
ORGANIZATION THAT SUCH A PA A

00:44:37.274 --> 00:44:38.509
FORM FROM.

00:44:38.575 --> 00:44:39.777
I MULTIPLE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

00:44:39.843 --> 00:44:41.145
COUNTIES ORANGE COUNTY IS THE

00:44:41.211 --> 00:44:43.247
SECOND LARGEST MEMBER.

00:44:43.313 --> 00:44:44.615
OF METRO LINK --

00:44:44.681 --> 00:44:47.317
AND WHAT'S UNIQUE FOR US IS THAT.

00:44:47.384 --> 00:44:49.953
WE AN ORANGE COUNTY FOR PROJECTS

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.021
ON THE METROLINK LINE THAT

00:44:51.088 --> 00:44:52.823
OPERATED ONE AND CONSTRUCTED

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:53.991
WITHIN.

00:44:54.058 --> 00:44:55.893
THE COUNTY OF ORANGE.

00:44:55.959 --> 00:44:57.261
WE ACTUALLY PERFORM THAT

00:44:57.327 --> 00:44:58.996
CONSTRUCTION WORKER STOPS.

00:44:59.063 --> 00:45:00.697
IT'S HISTORIC IT'S BEEN DONE

00:45:00.764 --> 00:45:02.266
THIS WAY FOR THE LAST DECADE --

00:45:02.332 --> 00:45:03.767
THERE'S KIND OF A WHOLE HOST OF%

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:05.402
HISTORY ON WHY THAT'S COME TO

00:45:05.469 --> 00:45:06.804
PUT COME TO BE ONE OF THE

00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:07.771
REASONS IS BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY

00:45:07.838 --> 00:45:08.472
OWN.

00:45:08.539 --> 00:45:10.808
ALL FORTY TWO MILES OF TRACK --

00:45:10.874 --> 00:45:12.576
OF THE METROLINK LINE.

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:15.145
AND AND AND BECAUSE OF THAT WE

00:45:15.212 --> 00:45:16.747
THINK THAT IT MAKES REALLY VERY

00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:19.083
LITTLE SENSE TO PROVIDE THIS THE

00:45:19.149 --> 00:45:20.517
MGC AUTHORITY.

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:22.486
FROM METRO LINK OUT WITHIN

00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:23.954
ORANGE COUNTY'S BORDERS WE THINK

00:45:24.021 --> 00:45:25.155
THERE COULD BE GREAT VALUE

00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:26.523
PROVIDED TO IT.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:28.025
SO WE WOULD ASK THE COMMITTEE I

00:45:28.092 --> 00:45:29.593
AM AND THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER AN

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.662
AMENDMENT THAT WOULD --

00:45:31.728 --> 00:45:34.598
THAT WOULD KIND OF A WRECK

00:45:34.665 --> 00:45:35.466
PRACTICES --

00:45:35.532 --> 00:45:36.900
IS PERFORMED WITHIN THE

00:45:36.967 --> 00:45:40.404
METROLINK ON ORANGE COUNTY LINES.

00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:41.305
AND EITHER PROVIDE THAT

00:45:41.371 --> 00:45:42.873
AUTHORITY TO ORANGE COUNTY --

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:45.476
CTA FOR TO SEE MGC OR JUST

00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:47.144
PROVIDE THE AUTHORITY TO THE TO

00:45:47.211 --> 00:45:48.745
THE TO THE OTHER MEMBER AGENCIES.

00:45:48.812 --> 00:45:50.280
OTHER OPERATE OUTSIDE OF ORANGE

00:45:50.347 --> 00:45:52.716
COUNTY AND AND SO SO THAT LINKS

00:45:52.783 --> 00:45:53.984
UP WITH CURRENT PRACTICE SO

00:45:54.051 --> 00:45:55.686
WITHOUT AGAIN MY APOLOGIES FOR

00:45:55.752 --> 00:45:57.988
THAT FOR NOT HAVING A LETTER AND

00:45:58.055 --> 00:45:58.822
AND KIND OF DOING THIS ON THE

00:45:58.889 --> 00:46:00.157
FLY BUT THOSE ARE CONCERNS IN

00:46:00.224 --> 00:46:01.458
THEIR VERY REAL BECAUSE OF THE

00:46:01.525 --> 00:46:03.293

WAY THAT FIVE THE JPA IT'S

00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:34.691
LITTLE PUNCHY AFTER FLOOR

00:46:34.758 --> 00:46:36.927
SESSION --

00:46:36.994 --> 00:46:39.263
WHERE THEY WORD WAS OCS IN THE

00:46:39.329 --> 00:46:41.698
LOOP ON THE CHANGED ON THE

RECENT CHANGES TO THE BILL?

00:46:46.937 --> 00:46:48.272
SOMEONE AROUND TOLD BY METROLINK

00:46:48.338 --> 00:46:49.106
STAFF THAT.

00:46:49.173 --> 00:46:49.706
THE BOARD MEMBERS WERE MADE

00:46:49.773 --> 00:46:51.441
AWARE -- AYE

00:46:51.508 --> 00:46:53.677
I WOULD POINT OUT THAT --

00:46:53.744 --> 00:46:55.279
UNDER THIS BILL IT JUST

00:46:55.345 --> 00:46:57.147
AUTHORIZES THE JP TO PURSUE THIS

00:46:57.214 --> 00:46:58.182
IT DOESN'T SAY WHERE THEY'RE

00:46:58.248 --> 00:46:59.650
GOING TO USE THE AUTHORITY AND

00:46:59.716 --> 00:47:01.318
SINCE METROLINK IS A A HAS

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:02.886
OSHITA A AS ONE OF ITS VOTING

00:47:02.953 --> 00:47:04.087
BOARD MEMBERS.

00:47:04.154 --> 00:47:05.989
IT COULD AS OF VOTING BOARD

00:47:06.056 --> 00:47:07.691
MEMBER HAVE INFLUENCE ON THE

00:47:07.758 --> 00:47:09.426
DECISION ON EXACTLY WHERE IN THE

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:12.162
TERRITORY OF THIS CONTRACTING

00:47:12.229 --> 00:47:13.363
METHOD IS UTILIZED [inaudible]

00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:14.998
WOULDN'T THAT.

00:47:15.065 --> 00:47:18.602
BE IN LINE WITH THE AMENDMENT

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:20.270
SUGGESTED BY OC TEARS

00:47:20.337 --> 00:47:22.873
REPRESENTATIVE --

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:24.241
AND WE MIGHT THAT BE ACCEPTABLE

00:47:24.308 --> 00:47:26.710
TO THE AUTHOR.

00:47:26.777 --> 00:47:28.612
THE AMENDMENT LANGUAGE I MEAN TO

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:29.846
ME THAT I UNDERSTAND IT'S

00:47:29.913 --> 00:47:31.215
PERMISSIVE AND ALLOWS THE

00:47:31.281 --> 00:47:32.983
CONVERSATION TO HAPPEN --

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:34.351
I DON'T KNOW IF MAKING

00:47:34.418 --> 00:47:36.253
EXPLICITLY.

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.488
PUTTING AN END MAKES THAT CHANGE

00:47:38.555 --> 00:47:39.089
AND WE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE A

00:47:39.156 --> 00:47:39.823
BETTER.

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:41.792
I'D HAVE TO GET MORE DIRECTION

00:47:41.858 --> 00:47:44.261
FROM MY BOARD AT THIS POINT YOU

00:47:44.328 --> 00:47:45.629
KNOW WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO CONNOR.

00:47:45.696 --> 00:47:47.231
PURSUE THIS AUTHORITY GIVEN THE

00:47:47.297 --> 00:47:49.032
SUBSTANTIAL AWARDTHAT STATE

00:47:49.099 --> 00:47:51.001
PROVIDED TO METROLINK TO IMPROVE

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:52.803
SERVICE AND OPEN A BOTTLE NEXT

00:47:52.869 --> 00:47:54.671

00:47:54.738 --> 00:47:55.739
WHILE TERRITORY.

00:47:55.806 --> 00:47:56.607
NOW THAT NATURALLY CA CURRENTLY

00:47:56.673 --> 00:47:58.008
OPERATES SERVICE AND I DON'T

00:47:58.075 --> 00:47:59.910
THINK THE BILL MANDATES THIS TO

00:47:59.977 --> 00:48:02.846
HAPPEN IT JUST ALLOWS IT TO

00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:03.347
HAPPEN AND IT ALLOWS THE

00:48:03.413 --> 00:48:04.214
PARTNERSHIP. TO DISCUSS WHERE

00:48:04.281 --> 00:48:05.015
AND WHEN IT HAPPENS IT JUST

00:48:05.082 --> 00:48:06.416
MAKES IT ELIGIBLE.

00:48:06.483 --> 00:48:08.018
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S A FATE

00:48:08.085 --> 00:48:09.419
ACCOMPLI SUCH I'M A LITTLE BIT

00:48:09.486 --> 00:48:11.121
SURPRISED BY.

00:48:11.188 --> 00:48:11.722
THE NEED FOR THE AMENDMENT BUT

00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:18.262
THAT'S WELL I I SEE THE OF

00:48:18.328 --> 00:48:21.565

00:48:28.071 --> 00:48:29.139
AS WELL.

00:48:29.206 --> 00:48:31.742
AND IF THE MEMBER IS NOT

00:48:31.808 --> 00:48:33.243
ACCEPTABLE ABLE RESPECTFULLY

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:36.280
LAYOFFS THIS BILL TODAY.

00:48:36.346 --> 00:48:38.215
GIVEN THAT MY HOME AREA --

00:48:38.282 --> 00:48:40.317
BY HAS A PROBLEM.

00:48:40.384 --> 00:48:41.618
THEN AGAIN I WOULD COMMIT TO

00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:48.625
THIS AFTERNOON AND TRY TO FIGURE

00:48:48.692 --> 00:48:49.726
IT OUT I MEAN I'M JUST NOT

AND THAT'S WHY IF WE GET THE

00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:10.901
CLARITY AND LAW THAT WE HAVE THE

00:51:10.967 --> 00:51:12.202

ACTUALLY PLAY OUT THE TIME LINE

00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:17.874

ESSENTIALLY DOING IS OPENING UP.

00:51:21.978 --> 00:51:23.780
BOTTLENECKS.

00:51:23.847 --> 00:51:25.482
IN RAIL SERVICE SO THAT.

COMMUTES WHERE THAT WHEREVER THE

00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:30.987
COMING FROM YOU KNOW VENTURA

00:51:31.054 --> 00:51:32.022

BUT THOUGH THE CORE PART OF THE

00:51:44.401 --> 00:51:46.203
RISK THERE ARE APPROACH IN OUR

00:51:46.269 --> 00:51:47.170
DESIRE TO GET ISN'T ALREADY NOW

00:51:47.237 --> 00:51:48.472

IS WHY THE LANGUAGE WAS

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:08.925
INTRODUCED JUST ABOUT A COUPLE

00:52:08.992 --> 00:52:11.528

BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S A LITTLE

00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:29.539
BIT OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING HERE.
