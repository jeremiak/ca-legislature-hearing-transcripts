ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. WELL THAT'S

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:07.391
WHEN THIS ITEM IS HEARD BEFORE

00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:10.094
WE RAISED A FEW ISSUES WITH THE

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.362
PROPOSAL- FIRST WAS HOW IT WOULD

00:42:11.428 --> 00:42:14.398
RELATE TO A RECENTLY ENACTED AND

00:42:14.465 --> 00:42:16.433
STILL BEING DEVELOPED- RELATED

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.636
INITIATIVES THAT WOULD PROMOTE

00:42:18.702 --> 00:42:20.437
LOCAL CLIMATE RESILIENCE AND

00:42:20.504 --> 00:42:22.873
ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION- AND WE

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.075
ALSO NOTED THAT- THE PROPOSAL

00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:26.243
THE PARAMETERS ON THE PROGRAM

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:27.811
MORE QUITE BROAD AND VAGUE AND

00:42:27.878 --> 00:42:29.280
IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR THE

00:42:29.346 --> 00:42:30.681
LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE EXACTLY

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:32.082
WHAT OBJECTIVES AND WHAT THEY

00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:33.784
WOULD BE GETTING FROM ALLOCATING

00:42:33.851 --> 00:42:35.586
FUNDING TO THIS PROGRAMME. OF

00:42:35.653 --> 00:42:37.321
THE TRAILER BILL IS PUT SOME

00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:38.322
ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS ON THE

00:42:38.389 --> 00:42:40.291
PROGRAM BUT IN OUR VIEW THE

00:42:40.357 --> 00:42:42.159
LANGUAGE IS STILL A VERY BROAD-

00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:43.694
IT STILL PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT

00:42:43.761 --> 00:42:46.730
AMOUNT OF DISCRETIN TO GOBIZ TO

00:42:46.797 --> 00:42:47.731
THAT THE CRITERIA FOR THE

00:42:47.798 --> 00:42:50.301
GRANTS- DETERMINE WHO WOULD GET

00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:52.803
THEM WHAT THEY WOULD BEFORE- AND

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.405
SO GIVEN THOSE FACTORS AND THIS

00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:56.006
PROPOSAL DOESN'T ALLOCATE

00:42:56.073 --> 00:42:58.542
FUNDING INTEL TWENTY THREE

00:42:58.609 --> 00:42:59.443
TWENTY FOUR DOESN'T ALLOCATE ANY

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.112
MONEY IN THE BUDGET YEAR ARE WE

00:43:02.179 --> 00:43:03.314
THINK IT COULD BE WARRANTED FOR

00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:05.049
OF THE LEGISLATURE TO DELAY ANY

00:43:05.115 --> 00:43:07.017
KIND OF APPROVAL ON THIS PROGRAM

00:43:07.084 --> 00:43:07.651
AS THE ADMINISTRATION TO COME

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:09.320
BACK WITH. MORE OF CONCRETE

00:43:09.386 --> 00:43:11.555
OBJECTIVES AND PROJECTS HERE

00:43:11.622 --> 00:43:14.425
THAT OF THE LEGISLATURE COULD BE

00:43:14.491 --> 00:43:16.994
CLEAR ON WHAT THEY WOULD BE

00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:18.495
GETTING FOR FUNDING FOR THIS

00:43:18.562 --> 00:43:20.564
INITIATIVE. THANK YOU SO JUST TO

00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:23.200
BE CLEAR THIS PROGRAM WILL BE

00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:24.301
IMPLEMENTED UNTIL YOU'RE TWENTY

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:26.337

00:43:26.403 --> 00:43:28.806
CORRECT TO THE REQUEST IS FOR

00:43:28.872 --> 00:43:30.274
ONE MILLION OR ONE HUNDRED

00:43:30.341 --> 00:43:32.543

A PROJECT. THAT MIGHT BE

00:44:55.993 --> 00:44:57.961

SOME REVENUE LIMITS THAT LOCALS

00:45:07.704 --> 00:45:13.277
MIGHT HAVE. WHAT IS THE FIRM

00:45:13.343 --> 00:45:14.878
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF YOU'RE

00:45:14.945 --> 00:45:17.448
TRYING TO DIVERSIFY A LOCAL

00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:19.750
INITIATIVE. WHAT WOULD BE THE- I

00:45:19.817 --> 00:45:21.452
GUESS THE IMPACT OR

00:45:21.518 --> 00:45:23.687
ACCOUNTABILITY OF SUCCESS ON

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:27.257
WHICH PROJECTS GET SELECTED.

00:45:27.324 --> 00:45:29.193
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO AS

00:45:29.259 --> 00:45:31.462
- AS SPECIFIED IN IN THE TRAILER

00:45:31.528 --> 00:45:35.099
BILL WITH PROPOSED IT DOES SAY

00:45:35.165 --> 00:45:36.333
THAT GO BIZ CAN DETERMINE THE

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.235
CRITERIA. WE'VE TRIED TO FILTER

00:45:38.302 --> 00:45:41.205
IT OUT AT A AT A PRETTY HIGH

00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:42.239
LEVEL AND LEAVE A LOT OF

00:45:42.306 --> 00:45:44.174
FLEXIBILITY HERE. I'LL SAY THAT

00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:45.442
THE NUMBER ONE REASON WE'RE

00:45:45.509 --> 00:45:47.311
TRYING TO BE FLEXIBLE AND NOT

00:45:47.377 --> 00:45:49.847
PREDETERMINED WITH. WITH A. B.

00:45:49.913 --> 00:45:52.950
C. AND D. REQUIREMENTS UP FRONT

00:45:53.016 --> 00:45:54.218
IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MEET THE

00:45:54.284 --> 00:45:56.386
LOCALS WHERE THEY ARE. SO EACH

00:45:56.453 --> 00:45:58.122
OF THE COUNTIES IS GOING TO BE

00:45:58.188 --> 00:46:00.958
IN A DIFFERENT SPOT IN TERMS OF

00:46:01.024 --> 00:46:01.592
WHAT THEY'RE EXISTING INDUSTRY

00:46:01.658 --> 00:46:03.594
INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT BE- WHERE

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:06.864
THEY MIGHT NEED TO GO ARE ONCE

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:07.631
AGO AND SO. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE

00:46:07.698 --> 00:46:09.266
THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE REASON

00:46:09.333 --> 00:46:10.868
THAT WE DRAFTED THIS WAY WE

00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:12.336
WOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT WE ARE

00:46:12.402 --> 00:46:14.238
OPEN TO INPUT. ON THE

00:46:14.304 --> 00:46:15.205
LEGISLATURE WHERE WE'RE HOPING

00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:17.174
TO MAKE THIS SUCCESSFUL SO WE

00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:19.143
LOOK FORWARD ANYTHING- THAT

00:46:19.209 --> 00:46:21.712
MIGHT BE HELPFUL. MY ONLY

00:46:21.778 --> 00:46:23.347
CONCERN AROUND THAT WOULD BE

00:46:23.413 --> 00:46:25.382
JUST THE BROAD DISCRETION FOR

00:46:25.449 --> 00:46:28.152
GOBIZ CAN CREATE UNINTENDED

00:46:28.218 --> 00:46:30.354
CONSEQUENCES IN WHICH- PROPOSALS

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:32.256
AREN'T LOOKED EQUALLY OR

00:46:32.322 --> 00:46:34.124
DEPENDING ON WHO IS MAKING THE

00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:38.829
PROPOSAL- HOW OLD. GO BIZ IS. I

00:46:38.896 --> 00:46:40.864
GUESS HOW GOBIZ WOULD EVENTUALLY

00:46:40.931 --> 00:46:43.934
JUST DECIDE. WHICH ONE SMALL

00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:46.870
FORWARD AND WITH WHICH COUNTY. I

00:46:46.937 --> 00:46:49.439
TAKE THAT AND IF ALL NOTED OUR

00:46:49.506 --> 00:46:51.375
BIGGEST A FILTER THAT EXISTS IN

00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:52.743
THE TRAILER BILL AND SPECIFYING

00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:55.679
ELIGIBILITY IS THAT A IT COUNTY

00:46:55.746 --> 00:46:57.848
IS ONLY ELIGIBLE IF IT'S IN A

00:46:57.915 --> 00:46:59.183
HIGH POVERTY OR HIGH EMPLOYMENT

00:46:59.249 --> 00:47:01.752
AREA. SO THAT BASICALLY LIMITS

00:47:01.818 --> 00:47:03.320
IT DOWN TO AT THIS POINT TEN

00:47:03.387 --> 00:47:05.556
COUNTIES SO FROM ARGUE THAT IS A

00:47:05.622 --> 00:47:08.692
BIG MITIGATING AGAINST THE

00:47:08.759 --> 00:47:09.760
CONCERN YOU'RE RAISING BUT WE DO

00:47:09.826 --> 00:47:10.294
ACKNOWLEDGE IT. AND WHAT

00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:11.562
HAPPENED FINAL QUESTIONS WHAT

00:47:11.628 --> 00:47:13.564
HAPPENS WHEN THE STABLE OF A

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:14.665
CIVILIZATION FUNDS ARE GONE. I

00:47:14.731 --> 00:47:16.867
WILL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BE ABLE

00:47:16.934 --> 00:47:19.536
TO. CONTINUE OR FUNCTION AT THAT

00:47:19.603 --> 00:47:21.271
POINT. THANK YOU FOR THE

00:47:21.338 --> 00:47:23.907
QUESTION THAT SO THE- THE IDEA

00:47:23.974 --> 00:47:26.176
IS THAT. THROUGH THE ENTIRE

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:29.513

APPLYING AND WHEN WE'RE WORKING

00:47:44.228 --> 00:47:46.063

THAT- HAVING A PLANT THAT'S

00:47:48.465 --> 00:47:50.667
REASONABLE AND FEASIBLE TO

ACHIEVE SUSTAINABILITY- AFTER

00:47:52.436 --> 00:47:55.772
