NOT ONLY APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:26.759

WE'RE STILL UNDER THE RESULTING

00:15:52.918 --> 00:15:54.286
RECEIVERSHIP. BECAUSE WE REALLY

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:56.322
HAVEN'T STRUCTURALLY FIX THE

00:15:56.388 --> 00:15:58.857
PROBLEM DEAR TO MANY PEOPLE

00:15:58.924 --> 00:16:01.327
INTO CONFINED SPACE WITH TOO

00:16:01.393 --> 00:16:03.462
FEW RESOURCES. AND THAT BRINGS

00:16:03.529 --> 00:16:04.763
US TO THE CONVERSATION TODAY

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.031

INTO OUR PRISON SYSTEM. AND IN

00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:15.274
MY OPINION THE SITUATION

00:16:15.341 --> 00:16:16.342
CURRENTLY OF FAN QUICKNESS

00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:18.444
CLEARLY JUST THE CANARY IN THE

COAL MINE. WE WILL SEE IN LESS

00:16:22.648 --> 00:16:24.183
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HAPPEN.

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:25.918
PRISON AFTER PRISON AFTER

I AM IN CHINO. AND SO THIS IS

00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:32.324
ON FORCING JUST THE TIP OF THE

00:16:32.391 --> 00:16:34.960
ICEBERG UNLESS DRASTIC CHANGE

00:16:35.027 --> 00:16:37.296

TO BE STERILIZED IN PRISON.

WHETHER IT'S THE LACK OF

REHABILITATION- OUR PRISON

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:14.726

FAILED US AND IN NO GREATER

00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:19.431
RESPECT THAN WHAT WE'RE SEEING

00:18:19.498 --> 00:18:22.701
NOW WITH THIS COVERT SITUATION.

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:23.635
I HAVE A FEDERAL PRISON IN MY

00:18:23.702 --> 00:18:25.370
DISTRICT THE LONG POKE FEDERAL

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:28.073

SAN QUENTIN. OF THE PLACE WITH

00:18:30.642 --> 00:18:32.544
THE GREATEST INCREASE AND

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:34.480
SURGING OF COVERT NINETEEN

00:18:34.546 --> 00:18:38.217
CASES- THE ABOUT THE INABILITY

00:18:38.283 --> 00:18:41.487
TO GET INFORMATION. TO BE ABLE

00:18:41.553 --> 00:18:41.954
TO HOLD THESE PEOPLE

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:43.222
ACCOUNTABLE OF COURSE THE

00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:44.456
FEDERAL SO THEY REALLY DON'T

00:18:44.523 --> 00:18:46.091
CARE MUCH ABOUT WHAT THE STATE

00:18:46.158 --> 00:18:47.893
HAS TO SAY ABOUT ANYTHING. BUT

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.728
NONE THE LESS WE SEE THE SAME

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:53.599
KIND OF LACK OF REGARD- IN OUR

00:18:53.665 --> 00:18:55.968
OWN CD SHE OUR SYSTEM WHEN IT

00:18:56.034 --> 00:18:57.970
COMES TO HOW WE TREAT THESE

00:18:58.036 --> 00:19:01.807
CENTERS. AND HOW WE ADDRESS THE

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:05.544
SERIOUSNESS OF THIS PROBLEM.

00:19:05.611 --> 00:19:06.144
ARE THERE PEOPLE IN PRISON WHO

00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:07.779
SOME MIGHT CAN TO BE. LESS THAN

00:19:07.846 --> 00:19:09.615
THE REST OF US THE FACT OF THE

00:19:09.681 --> 00:19:11.884
MATTER IS THAT THESE ARE PEOPLE

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.018
OVER WHOM WE ALL OF

00:19:13.085 --> 00:19:14.319
RESPONSIBILITY THEY ARE

00:19:14.386 --> 00:19:16.755
INCARCERATED. THEY HAVE THEY

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:19.458
HAVE LOST THEIR FREEDOM- AND SO

00:19:19.525 --> 00:19:20.926
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:25.130
CARE FOR THEM AS HUMAN BEINGS.

00:19:25.197 --> 00:19:27.799
AND WE'RE NOT DOING THAT SO I

00:19:27.866 --> 00:19:29.902
WILL BE VERY INTERESTED TO HEAR

00:19:29.968 --> 00:19:32.170
WHAT HAPPENS TODAY AS WELL. I

00:19:32.237 --> 00:19:33.839
AM VERY FRUSTRATED WITH OUR

00:19:33.906 --> 00:19:36.141
FEDERAL SYSTEM. WHICH AGAIN

00:19:36.208 --> 00:19:37.209
DOES NOT THINK THAT THEY HAVE

00:19:37.276 --> 00:19:38.677
ANY ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE

00:19:38.744 --> 00:19:40.345
PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND

00:19:40.412 --> 00:19:42.648
YET MANY OF THOSE GUARDS IN THE

00:19:42.714 --> 00:19:43.682
STAFF AND THE PEOPLE WHO WORK

00:19:43.749 --> 00:19:45.551
THERE. HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO

00:19:45.617 --> 00:19:47.586
THIS CONDITION AND BROUGHT IT

00:19:47.653 --> 00:19:49.855
BACK INTO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY-

00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:51.690
I THINK THAT THAT IS PART OF

00:19:51.757 --> 00:19:53.825
THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE SEEING-

00:19:53.892 --> 00:19:56.395
BUT THE- THE FACT THAT THERE

00:19:56.461 --> 00:19:57.663
HAS BEEN A COMPLETE AND UTTER

00:19:57.729 --> 00:20:00.866
DISREGARD OF FOR THESE. THE

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:03.435
INMATES AS HUMAN BEINGS AND THE

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:05.871
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE A

00:20:05.938 --> 00:20:08.373
SOCIETY TO KEEP PEOPLE AT LEAST

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.675
THE VERY BASIC LEVEL OF HUMAN

00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:12.177
DIGNITY. I HAS REALLY LED TO

00:20:12.244 --> 00:20:15.480
THIS PROBLEM TODAY AND IT IS MY

00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:18.016
HOPE THAT OUT OF ADVERSITY.

00:20:18.083 --> 00:20:19.484
COMES OPPORTUNITY OR AS THEY

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:21.687

00:20:21.753 --> 00:20:23.188
MAKE LEMONADE THAT WE CAN

00:20:23.255 --> 00:20:25.223
REALLY START MOVING AND

FINANCING ARE MORE CARING A

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:31.296
MORE CHARGED UP IN FAIRVIEW.

GENERAL POPULATION BUT THEY

00:20:40.672 --> 00:20:41.873
SHOULD NOT BE ISOLATED FROM

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.944
HUMANITY AND THAT I THINK IS

00:20:46.011 --> 00:20:51.183
WHAT I HOPE WE CAN ADDRESS SIR

AROUND THE MODELING OKAY WHICH

00:53:06.116 --> 00:53:07.551
IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD AND

MENTIONED- A SECURE IN NUMBER

00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:36.212
OF TASKS. THAT ENOUGH IS THERE

00:53:36.279 --> 00:53:38.715
MORE TO DO ABSOLUTELY I AM THE

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:41.952

WAS ARE YOU KNOW REALLY

00:53:46.723 --> 00:53:48.692
MULTIPLE FACTORS BUT AT THE END

00:53:48.758 --> 00:53:50.961
OF THE DAY I TAKE THEM WE TAKE

00:53:51.027 --> 00:53:53.830
A SERIOUS RESPONSIBILITY TO

00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:56.566
STARTING NOW WITH NOT ENOUGH

00:53:56.633 --> 00:53:58.068
TESTING NOT JUST IN OUR

00:53:58.134 --> 00:53:59.869
CONGREGATE CARE SETTINGS OF

00:53:59.936 --> 00:54:01.171
THOSE THAT ARE RUN BY THE STATE

00:54:01.237 --> 00:54:03.540
BUT- WHY. AND TODAY. WE REALLY

00:54:03.607 --> 00:54:08.144
REYES STOP START FROM JUST

00:54:08.211 --> 00:54:11.848
DAY BACK IN APRIL TWO TODAY-

ACHIEVED OVER A HUNDRED

00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:16.286
THOUSAND TESTS ON SOME DAYS.

00:54:16.353 --> 00:54:17.287
THINGS TO ME AND THAT'S IT ALL

00:54:17.354 --> 00:54:18.989
OF YOU IS TESTING IS. AND MANY

00:54:19.055 --> 00:54:20.490
OF OUR FACILITIES AND ITS

00:54:20.557 --> 00:54:22.559
RAMPING UP SO THAT SHOULD

00:54:22.626 --> 00:54:24.728
BECOME SOMETHING THAT ALLOWS US

00:54:24.794 --> 00:54:26.696
MORE INTELLIGENCE INTO THE

00:54:26.763 --> 00:54:28.465
SITUATIONS IN THE FACILITIES

00:54:28.531 --> 00:54:30.800
ALLOWS US TO PLAN BETTER THERE

00:54:30.867 --> 00:54:32.736
IS NO DISPUTE BUT MORE COULD BE

00:54:32.802 --> 00:54:35.705
AND SHOULD BE DONE. SO I WOULD

00:54:35.772 --> 00:54:37.774
HESITATE TO LEAVE THE COMMITTEE

00:54:37.841 --> 00:54:39.476
WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT I OR

00:54:39.542 --> 00:54:41.878
ANY OF US BELIEVE THAT THE-

00:54:41.945 --> 00:54:44.180
RESPONSE HAS BEEN SATISFACTORY

00:54:44.247 --> 00:54:46.583
AND THAT MORE SHOULD AND CAN BE.

00:54:46.650 --> 00:54:47.984
THANK YOU CENTER MORE BLACK

00:54:48.051 --> 00:54:49.252

WITH THIS CRISIS MANAGEMENT-

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:55.792
SITUATION. WE'RE DEALING WITH

00:54:55.859 --> 00:54:57.861
CONSTITUENTS AND THEY APPEAR TO

00:54:57.927 --> 00:54:59.596
WILL- PERCEIVE AND THEY'RE

00:54:59.663 --> 00:55:01.598
OBSERVING. THAT WERE NEGLECTING

00:55:01.665 --> 00:55:04.300
NURSING HOMES IN PRISONS. AND

00:55:04.367 --> 00:55:05.301
ALL THEY SEE IS BEING TOLD THE

00:55:05.368 --> 00:55:08.138
CLOSE BEACHES AND RENTAL HAS

00:55:08.204 --> 00:55:09.973
SAID ARE USED SO WE'RE- TRYING

00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:10.740
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:55:10.807 --> 00:55:11.474
COMMUNICATE TO OUR

00:55:11.541 --> 00:55:13.943
CONSTITUENTS. AND HOW CAN I

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:16.579
BEST TELL THEM HOW YOU SELECT

00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:24.621
PRIORITIES. DOCTOR GROWING YOUR

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:29.092
MUTED AGAIN. WE STILL CAN'T

00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:33.329
HEAR YOU. OKAY NOW I ARE YOU

00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:34.330

HEAR US NOW YES YES SEEMS LIKE

00:55:36.399 --> 00:55:38.101
EACH TIME WE HAVE TO ON MUTE SO

00:55:38.168 --> 00:55:40.203
YEAH RIGHT TO BE QUICKER DOING

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:42.572
THAT- I THINK IT'S A VERY

00:55:42.639 --> 00:55:44.974
IMPORTANT QUESTION AND THE

00:55:45.041 --> 00:55:46.242
ISSUING CONGREGATE CARE

00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:48.812
FACILITIES IS- CLEARLY THE

00:55:48.878 --> 00:55:51.715
FRONT DOOR BY IS WHERE THE

00:55:51.781 --> 00:55:54.150
INFECTION COMES AND- AND BASED

00:55:54.217 --> 00:55:56.019
ON THE LEVEL OF MAKE SCENE

00:55:56.086 --> 00:55:58.054
BETWEEN STAFF AND RESIDENTS

00:55:58.121 --> 00:55:59.255
WHETHER THOSE ARE IN MAY TO

00:55:59.322 --> 00:56:00.623
RESIDENTS IN A SKILLED NURSING

00:56:00.690 --> 00:56:03.460
FACILITY. WE BEGIN TO SEE A

00:56:03.526 --> 00:56:06.396
VERY RAPID SPREAD RATE SO OUR

00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:08.631
NUMBER ONE STRATEGY IS TO

00:56:08.698 --> 00:56:10.333
ENSURE THAT IN ANY CONGREGATE

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.736
CARE FACILITY THAT WE PREVENT

00:56:12.802 --> 00:56:14.504
INFECTION COME COMING IN THE

00:56:14.571 --> 00:56:16.940
FRONT DOOR I WILL SAY SENATOR

00:56:17.006 --> 00:56:19.509
MORE LIKE THAT WE HAVE HAD A

00:56:19.576 --> 00:56:21.010
NUMBER OF SUCCESS STORIES

00:56:21.077 --> 00:56:22.312
WITHIN AND SOME OF THE

00:56:22.378 --> 00:56:23.947
CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES

00:56:24.013 --> 00:56:25.415
WHERE AND WE MIGHT EVEN AT A

00:56:25.482 --> 00:56:27.717
LARGER RATE. IN THAT SETTING

00:56:27.784 --> 00:56:30.687
BUT HAVE BEAT THROUGH SOME VERY

00:56:30.754 --> 00:56:32.622
FULL TRIED AND TRUE FRANKLY

00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:34.958
INFECTION CONTROL STRATEGIES

00:56:35.024 --> 00:56:39.295
AND ABLE TO SEPARATE STAFF.

00:56:39.362 --> 00:56:40.797
EIGHT RESIDENTS ARE IN MAY. AND

00:56:40.864 --> 00:56:42.665
ALLOW YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY

00:56:42.732 --> 00:56:44.100
WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT

00:56:44.167 --> 00:56:46.603
CONSEQUENCE. IN TERMS OF

00:56:46.669 --> 00:56:49.539
ILLNESS IN DOUBT- THE OUTBREAK

00:56:49.606 --> 00:56:51.107
TO SETTLE DOWN AND THEN

00:56:51.174 --> 00:56:54.110
INSTITUTE. SERIAL TESTING AND

00:56:54.177 --> 00:56:56.246
SURVEILLANCE TESTING TO PROTECT

00:56:56.312 --> 00:56:57.680
FURTHER OUTBREAKS WE'VE DONE

00:56:57.747 --> 00:56:58.681
THOUGH IN A NUMBER OF

00:56:58.748 --> 00:57:01.718
FACILITIES NOT JUST IN THE

00:57:01.785 --> 00:57:02.452
SKILLED NURSING SETTING BUT

00:57:02.519 --> 00:57:05.388
ASSISTED LIVING SETTING I KNOW-

00:57:05.455 --> 00:57:07.557
SECRETARY TIAS HAS SIMILAR

00:57:07.624 --> 00:57:09.626
STORIES SO IT CAN CERTAINLY BE

00:57:09.692 --> 00:57:12.295
DONE AND HAS BEEN DONE I WOULD

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:14.931
SAY THAT PART OF WHAT WE SEE

00:57:14.998 --> 00:57:16.800
ABSOLUTELY YEARS AS COMMUNITY

00:57:16.866 --> 00:57:18.902
SPREADING INCREASES. SO THE

00:57:18.968 --> 00:57:21.004
CURRENT WAVE OF INCREASED CASES

00:57:21.070 --> 00:57:23.540
ACROSS OUR COMMUNITIES ARE LOW

00:57:23.606 --> 00:57:27.010
ARE- EARLY INDICATORS OF THE

00:57:27.076 --> 00:57:28.611
SPREAD THAT WE WILL AGAIN SEE

00:57:28.678 --> 00:57:30.346
IN SOME OF OUR CONGREGATE CARE

00:57:30.413 --> 00:57:33.082
FACILITY. SO WITH THIS INCREASE

00:57:33.149 --> 00:57:36.252
AND COMMUNITY SPREAD WE HAVE

00:57:36.319 --> 00:57:37.887
AND WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE

00:57:37.954 --> 00:57:39.255
OUR OWN VIGILANCE AND SOME OF

00:57:39.322 --> 00:57:40.557
THOSE CONGREGATE CARE

00:57:40.623 --> 00:57:43.092
FACILITIES THE OTHER POINT OF

00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:44.828
OUR IMPORTANCE IS OUR

00:57:44.894 --> 00:57:46.396
CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES

00:57:46.462 --> 00:57:50.266
WHETHER THEIR JAILS AND PRISONS

00:57:50.333 --> 00:57:50.900
FOR NURSING HOMES OR OTHER

00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:54.504
SETTING. TO HAVE SOME OF OUR

00:57:54.571 --> 00:57:56.306
MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS

00:57:56.372 --> 00:58:00.877
HEALTH. THE NUMBER OF MORE IS

00:58:00.944 --> 00:58:03.213
AND HAND UP MEDICAL WITHIN. IN

00:58:03.279 --> 00:58:04.581
THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WHETHER AT

00:58:04.647 --> 00:58:05.849
THE LOCAL LEVEL AT THE STATE

00:58:05.915 --> 00:58:08.151
LEVEL IS EXTREMELY HIGH

00:58:08.218 --> 00:58:12.055
COMPARED TO OUR- COMMUNITIES-

00:58:12.121 --> 00:58:14.257
ARE ARE- I'M NOT. IN CONGREGATE

00:58:14.324 --> 00:58:15.959
SETTING COMMUNITIES AND THAT

00:58:16.025 --> 00:58:18.895
DOES. PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO

00:58:18.962 --> 00:58:19.896
THE LEVEL OF VULNERABILITY

00:58:19.963 --> 00:58:21.931
AROUND KOBE NINETEEN WE

00:58:21.998 --> 00:58:23.600
CONTINUE TO REFINE OUR

00:58:23.666 --> 00:58:24.901
UNDERSTANDING OF WHICH

00:58:24.968 --> 00:58:26.836
UNDERLYING CONDITIONS LEND

00:58:26.903 --> 00:58:28.037
THEMSELVES TO THE WORST

00:58:28.104 --> 00:58:30.173
OUTCOMES THE CDC AND PRACTICED

UPDATED OVER THE WEEKEND THE

00:58:33.843 --> 00:58:35.245
LIST OF TIERED. CONDITIONS THAT

00:58:35.311 --> 00:58:38.181
SEEM TO HAVE THE HIGHEST RISK

00:58:38.248 --> 00:58:40.650
OF BAD OUTCOMES WITH PREVENT

00:58:40.717 --> 00:58:41.584
NINETEEN AND THE STATE LOOKS AT

00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:42.986
THAT AND UPDATES OUR OWN

00:58:43.052 --> 00:58:44.854
GUIDANCE SUPPORT. THANK YOU

YEAR OVER YEAR- SO DO WE HAVE

00:59:04.641 --> 00:59:05.975

BUT THAT RECEIVERS ALSO OVER

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:03.199
TIME TURNED CERTAIN FACILITIES

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:04.434
ABOUT HALF THE FACILITIES BACK

THE REMAINDER WERE MOVED TO SAM

01:17:53.001 --> 01:17:56.838
QUITE. BECAUSE THE MATRIX- DID

01:17:56.905 --> 01:17:58.640
NOT SPECIFY THAT THE REQUIRED

WERE TWO THREE AND IN SOME

01:18:16.958 --> 01:18:18.827
CASES FOUR WEEKS ALL. FAR TOO

01:18:18.894 --> 01:18:21.363
OLD TO BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:23.231
FOR THE ABSENCE OF CO. AS IT

01:18:23.298 --> 01:18:26.101

THEIR REPORT. REALLY

01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:37.772
CONTRIBUTED TO THE RAPID SPREAD

CONSENTED TO BE TEST. THIRD

01:20:26.888 --> 01:20:28.823
MANY PATIENTS AT SAN QUENTIN

ASSESS. AND THAT MAKES IT

01:20:40.869 --> 01:20:41.303
DIFFICULT TO MANAGE THE

MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO MANAGE

01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:01.122
THE POPULATION DURING AN

01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:03.291

01:21:03.358 --> 01:21:04.326
TO SEPARATE PATIENTS

01:21:04.392 --> 01:21:05.227

01:21:22.744 --> 01:21:24.312
MUCH STRICTER TRANSPORT TESTING

01:21:24.379 --> 01:21:27.449
POLICY. SO THAT ALL ONE HUNDRED

01:21:27.515 --> 01:21:29.084

REPORT ON WHETHER THEY HAVE

01:29:24.092 --> 01:29:26.861
COVE IT IS SELF REPORTED I

01:29:26.928 --> 01:29:28.629
GUESS THE POINT OF THIS IS.

01:29:28.696 --> 01:29:30.698
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO REQUIRE

01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:33.634
STAFF TO BE TESTED AND WHAT ARE

01:29:33.701 --> 01:29:35.670
WE GOING TO REQUIRE STAFF TO

01:29:35.737 --> 01:29:37.939
HAVE TO INFORM THE DEPARTMENT

01:29:38.005 --> 01:29:40.274
WHEN THEY ARE POSITIVE AND

01:29:40.341 --> 01:29:42.310
SIMILARLY WHEN ARE WE GOING TO

01:29:42.376 --> 01:29:44.679
HAVE MORE THOROUGH TESTING. OF

01:29:44.746 --> 01:29:46.914
THE INCARCERATED POPULATION IN

01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:51.953
EITHER SECRETARY DHEAS OR MR

01:29:52.019 --> 01:29:52.920
CALL SO YOU YOU COULD RESPOND

01:29:52.987 --> 01:29:55.189
TO. SO CALLED ALL NOT TAKE THIS

01:29:55.256 --> 01:29:58.626
THAT TESTING. SO AS FAR AS A

01:29:58.693 --> 01:30:02.597
STAFF TESTING GOES. WE ARE

01:30:02.663 --> 01:30:04.198
AGGRESSIVELY TRYING TO SEEK

01:30:04.265 --> 01:30:05.833
GREATER CONTRACTS TO PROVIDE

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:07.902
GREATER TESTING AT ALL OF OUR

01:30:07.969 --> 01:30:09.103
INSTITUTIONS BUT AS SAID

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:11.172
EARLIER IN MY STATEMENT IT IS

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:12.907
BECOMING IT IS DIFFICULT TO.

01:30:12.974 --> 01:30:15.910
RECEIVE AND OBTAIN CONTRACTS TO

01:30:15.977 --> 01:30:18.646
BE ABLE TO SUFFICIENTLY TEST

ALL STAFF MEMBERS AT ALL

01:30:20.348 --> 01:30:22.683
INSTITUTIONS. AND WITH THAT

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:24.318
BECAUSE OF THAT CONCERN I HAVE

01:30:24.385 --> 01:30:26.154
LEANED INTO WHAT THE CALIFORNIA

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:27.822
OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES

01:30:27.889 --> 01:30:30.224
WITH DIRECTOR WG. JUST TO SEE

01:30:30.291 --> 01:30:31.926
IF I CAN GET RESOURCES THAN

01:30:31.993 --> 01:30:33.594
ASSISTANCE FROM THE CALIFORNIA

01:30:33.661 --> 01:30:34.996
NATIONAL GUARD BUT IN THE

01:30:35.062 --> 01:30:38.432
MEANTIME WE HAVE- BEGAN SEEKING

01:30:38.499 --> 01:30:40.568
TO TEST AT INSTITUTIONS- WHERE

01:30:40.635 --> 01:30:42.537
WE HAVE OUTBREAKS. STAFF ARE

01:30:42.603 --> 01:30:44.939
REQUIRED TO LET US KNOW IF WE

01:30:45.006 --> 01:30:46.674
IF THEY HAVE TESTED POSITIVE IN

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:48.142
THE COMMUNITY THEY DO LET US

01:30:48.209 --> 01:30:49.744
THOUGH THE MAJORITY OF THAT

01:30:49.811 --> 01:30:51.379
STAFF POSITIVES ARE REPORTED TO

01:30:51.445 --> 01:30:53.014
US BECAUSE THEY HAVE TESTED IN

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.415
THE COMMUNITY- AT THEIR OWN

01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:57.785
DOCTORS. THE REPORTED BACK- SO

01:30:57.852 --> 01:31:02.490
THAT IS IN PLACE THAT IS A

01:31:02.557 --> 01:31:05.526
REQUIREMENT OF STUFF BUT THEY

01:31:05.593 --> 01:31:06.093
MUST LET US KNOW THAT THEY-

01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:10.965
ALSO. MA'AM CHAIR ON THE- SIDE

01:31:11.032 --> 01:31:13.601
OF INMATE TEST. YEAH THE THREE

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:15.670
AND APRIL WE'D SIMPLY AS BOBBY

01:31:15.736 --> 01:31:16.904
GALLEYS INDICATED WE DIDN'T

01:31:16.971 --> 01:31:19.307
HAVE ADEQUATE. WE DIDN'T HAVE

01:31:19.373 --> 01:31:20.775
TESTING RESOURCES TO CONDUCT

01:31:20.842 --> 01:31:23.244
THE SORT OF TESTING THAT-

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:25.813
WIDESPREAD TESTING THAT WOULD

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.715
LET US DO SURVEILLANCE OF HOW

01:31:27.782 --> 01:31:29.650
MANY INSTITUTIONS HAD CODE. NOW

01:31:29.717 --> 01:31:31.686
WE DID FINALLY- AS TESTING

01:31:31.752 --> 01:31:33.888
RESOURCES BECAME MORE GENERALLY

01:31:33.955 --> 01:31:36.257
AVAILABLE IN MAY. INSTITUTE A

01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:39.327
SURVEILLANCE TESTING PROGRAM

01:31:39.393 --> 01:31:40.928
WHERE WE DID NOT TEST ALL

01:31:40.995 --> 01:31:42.396
INMATES BECAUSE WE STILL DIDN'T

01:31:42.463 --> 01:31:44.432
HAVE THAT MUCH TESTING CAPACITY

01:31:44.498 --> 01:31:46.534
BUT WE- BASED ON SOME

01:31:46.601 --> 01:31:47.902
STATISTICAL MODEL PREPARED BY

01:31:47.969 --> 01:31:49.637
OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OF THE

01:31:49.704 --> 01:31:51.672
DIVISION. OF TESTED

01:31:51.739 --> 01:31:53.274
STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT

01:31:53.341 --> 01:31:56.744
SAMPLES OF THE INMATES EL ALL

01:31:56.811 --> 01:31:58.446
INSTITUTIONS. TO SEE IF WE

01:31:58.512 --> 01:32:01.582
COULD IDENTIFY WHERE WE HAD OUR

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:02.450
GOAL WOULD PRESENT IN THE

01:32:02.516 --> 01:32:04.485
INMATE POPULATION AND WHAT IF

01:32:04.552 --> 01:32:06.654
WE FOUND A POSITIVE CASE THEN

01:32:06.721 --> 01:32:08.422
WE WOULD FOCUS ATTENTION ON WE

01:32:08.489 --> 01:32:09.724
NEED TO TEST EVERYBODY OF THAT

01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:13.527
INSTITUTION- TODAY WE HAVE-

01:32:13.594 --> 01:32:15.796
ESSENTIALLY TWENTY THOUSAND OR

01:32:15.863 --> 01:32:17.832
SO BUT THIRTY THOUSAND OR SO

01:32:17.899 --> 01:32:19.800
TESTS AVAILABLE TO US. ON THAT

01:32:19.867 --> 01:32:24.672
WE CAN USE A WEEKLY BASIS- SO-

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:27.141
IT IS. IT IS CURRENTLY BEING

01:32:27.208 --> 01:32:29.410
EXAMINED HOW WE CAN EXPAND THE

01:32:29.477 --> 01:32:31.345
SURVEILLANCE TESTING PROGRAM.

01:32:31.412 --> 01:32:32.446
BECAUSE WE DON'T THINK GUARD

01:32:32.513 --> 01:32:35.082
SAMPLE SIZE WAS LARGE ENOUGH.

01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:37.485
SO THAT WE COULD CATCH UP

01:32:37.551 --> 01:32:39.654
ENOUGH PRISONS EARLY ENOUGH TO

01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:42.623
PREVENT A LARGER OUTBREAKS SO

01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:43.925
WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF NOW

01:32:43.991 --> 01:32:45.693
DOING THE SAME THING- SECRETARY

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.461
DEALS IS DOING ON THE EMPLOYEE

01:32:47.528 --> 01:32:49.830
SIDE. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

01:32:49.897 --> 01:32:51.899
CAN WE EXPAND THE NUMBER OF

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:54.001
BEEN MADE TO GET TESTED. WE DO

01:32:54.068 --> 01:32:56.170
HAVE THE CHALLENGES ARE EVEN

01:32:56.237 --> 01:32:57.571
WITH AN EXPANSION OF THAT

01:32:57.638 --> 01:33:00.574
PROGRAM. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER

01:33:00.641 --> 01:33:02.476
OF INMATES REFUSING. AND THE IF

01:33:02.543 --> 01:33:04.011

01:33:04.078 --> 01:33:05.246

CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL HAVE A

01:33:09.183 --> 01:33:11.218
VERY LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:12.920
REFUSING TO UNDERGO TESTING AT

01:33:12.987 --> 01:33:15.389
THAT RATE. AND THAT CERTAINLY

01:33:15.456 --> 01:33:18.826
COMPLICATES ANY EFFORTS TO-

01:33:18.893 --> 01:33:20.428
IDENTIFY WHERE YOU HAVE. BUT

01:33:20.494 --> 01:33:21.729
IT'S NOT AN INSURMOUNTABLE

01:33:21.796 --> 01:33:23.297
PROBLEM BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:33:23.364 --> 01:33:24.231

01:38:49.757 --> 01:38:50.924
THING THAT WE'VE DONE THAT I

02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:51.481
SAFE RESPONSIBLE SOLUTION IS

CONTAINMENT AT LANCASTER AND

SUCH. BUT JUST THE NATURE OF

OUR FACILITIES. THIS COULD

02:59:55.684 --> 02:59:59.088
HAPPEN IN. AND MY THIS MUST BE

02:59:59.155 --> 03:00:01.857
DEALT WITH AS A SYSTEM WIDE IT

03:00:01.924 --> 03:00:04.927

03:00:15.471 --> 03:00:19.441
TRAILER BILL HE'S STILL ON THE

03:00:19.508 --> 03:00:19.975
TWO WAS NOT PASSED BY THE

03:00:20.042 --> 03:00:22.178
SECOND HOUSE YET. WE HAVE THE

03:00:22.244 --> 03:00:24.613
DOZEN STATUTE RIGHT NOW MEDICAL

03:00:24.680 --> 03:00:28.651
ELDERLY PAROLE. AND NOW WHEN IT

03:00:28.717 --> 03:00:31.554
WAS DESIGNED IT WASN'T I DON'T

03:00:31.620 --> 03:00:33.055
THINK WE NECESSARILY THOUGHT OF

03:00:33.122 --> 03:00:38.060
IT IN RELATIONSHIP. TO TWO

03:00:38.127 --> 03:00:40.563
PANDEMIC LIKE THIS I THINK THE

03:00:40.629 --> 03:00:42.064
MIDDLE PEOPLE HAD DIFFERENT

03:00:42.131 --> 03:00:43.766
MOTIVATIONS OBVIOUSLY BUT PART

03:00:43.832 --> 03:00:46.502
OF THE THINKING AT THE TIME

03:00:46.569 --> 03:00:47.603
THAT IT WAS DEVELOPED WAS THE

03:00:47.670 --> 03:00:51.941
FACT THAT OUR PRINTING COSTS.

03:00:52.007 --> 03:00:53.275
OUR STATE BUDGET FIRST YOUR UP

03:00:53.342 --> 03:00:55.611
EXPONENTIALLY AND LARGELY DUE

03:00:55.678 --> 03:00:56.845
TO THE TO THESE LARGE

03:00:56.912 --> 03:00:59.114
HEALTHCARE COSTS OF THESE VERY

03:00:59.181 --> 03:01:01.483
MEDICALLY FRAGILE PEOPLE IN

03:01:01.550 --> 03:01:04.086
VERY ELDERLY PEOPLE AND JUSTICE

03:01:04.153 --> 03:01:05.621
IN THE REST OF THE POCKET. AND

03:01:05.688 --> 03:01:06.989
SO THERE WAS THE NET. IF WE

03:01:07.056 --> 03:01:09.592
COULD X. COULD NOT JUST EXPAND

03:01:09.658 --> 03:01:11.260
WE HAD NO MEDICAL AN ELDERLY

03:01:11.327 --> 03:01:13.429
PRO UNTIL THAT STATUTE WAS

03:01:13.495 --> 03:01:16.198
PASSED. NOW YOU KNOW I'VE NOW

03:01:16.265 --> 03:01:19.101
ASK IT. THAT STRUCTURE BEEN

03:01:19.168 --> 03:01:23.939
PAST THERE HAVE BEEN VERY VERY.

03:01:24.006 --> 03:01:26.442
IT REALLY PAROLED UNDER THOSE.

03:01:26.508 --> 03:01:27.977
AND HERE WE ARE IN THIS

03:01:28.043 --> 03:01:30.512
PANDEMIC THAT STATUTE IS STILL

03:01:30.579 --> 03:01:34.149
AVAILABLE TO CDC ARE IN YET

03:01:34.216 --> 03:01:37.152
WHEN I PASSED A SECRETARY DS

03:01:37.219 --> 03:01:40.356
ABOUT IT EXPLICITLY PROX

03:01:40.422 --> 03:01:41.924
WILLIAM TO GO. TO ME THAT'S THE

03:01:41.991 --> 03:01:43.525
EIGHT PEOPLE RECOMMENDED BUT

03:01:43.592 --> 03:01:44.660
WHEN I ASKED HIM FOR THE TIME

03:01:44.727 --> 03:01:48.230
PERIOD HE SAID IT WAS SEVENTY

03:01:48.297 --> 03:01:48.797
EIGHT THAT WERE RECOMMENDED

03:01:48.864 --> 03:01:51.900
BACK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND NON

03:01:51.967 --> 03:01:56.438
SITS. DOWN THOSE. VERY FEW WERE

03:01:56.505 --> 03:01:58.340
ACTUALLY SUCCESSFUL ONCE BEFORE

03:01:58.407 --> 03:02:00.809
THE PROBOARDS AND I THINK IT'S

03:02:00.876 --> 03:02:01.410
VERY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO

03:02:01.477 --> 03:02:02.945
UNDERSTAND. THAT THE MEDICAL ON

03:02:03.012 --> 03:02:04.380
THE PEARL DOESN'T JUST LET

03:02:04.446 --> 03:02:07.149
PEOPLE BE RELEASED THE START TO

03:02:07.216 --> 03:02:07.716
GO FOR THE PRO ABOARD IN THE

03:02:07.783 --> 03:02:17.092
PROBE NOT EVEN ACTING. AND

03:02:17.159 --> 03:02:19.628
CERTAINLY GIVEN THAT WE KNOW.

03:02:19.695 --> 03:02:22.898
THAT THE DEATH RATE IS HIGHER

03:02:22.965 --> 03:02:23.699
FOR MEDICALLY FRAGILE AN

03:02:23.766 --> 03:02:25.834
ELDERLY PEOPLE. THEN IT ONLY

03:02:25.901 --> 03:02:28.771
MAKES SENSE FOR US TO USE THIS

03:02:28.837 --> 03:02:29.772
FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND THE

03:02:29.838 --> 03:02:31.106
ADMINISTRATION TO YOU THE

03:02:31.173 --> 03:02:34.576
STATUTORY TOOLS THAT WE HAVE

03:02:42.751 --> 03:02:43.385
WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT YOU

03:02:43.452 --> 03:02:49.224
KNOW IT COST US RIGHT NOW. IN

03:02:49.291 --> 03:02:53.829
THE INCARCERATED IN TO HOW THEM

03:02:53.896 --> 03:02:57.666
AND- IF WE WERE TO DO A DEEP

03:02:57.733 --> 03:02:59.868
BECAUSE OF THIS PUBLIC CRISES.

03:02:59.935 --> 03:03:03.706
PARK FOR THEM ALL WOULD BE FOR

03:03:03.772 --> 03:03:09.845
LESS FAR LESS AND WE ALSO HEARD.

03:03:09.912 --> 03:03:12.548
TIMES ABOUT STAFFING SHORTAGES

03:03:12.614 --> 03:03:15.084
WHICH SURPRISE ME BECAUSE WE

03:03:15.150 --> 03:03:18.320
HAVE A VERY NUMBER OF STAFF IN

03:03:18.387 --> 03:03:22.658
OUR. A PRISON SYSTEM IN A CD

03:03:22.725 --> 03:03:24.860

03:03:37.706 --> 03:03:40.142
HOUSING A DIFFERENT SETTING SO

03:03:40.209 --> 03:03:42.177
