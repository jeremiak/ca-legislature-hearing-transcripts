IS PERMISSIBLE. AND IMPORTANT

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:14.506

WE BUT I SHOULD BE WORKING TO

00:34:01.038 --> 00:34:02.940
ADDRESS THOSE- BUT I WOULD

00:34:03.007 --> 00:34:04.475
POINT OUT THAT THE ALTERNATIVE

00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:05.576
WHICH IS THE COURTS SYSTEMS

00:34:05.643 --> 00:34:08.413
EVEN MORE BACKED UP. AND EFFECT

00:34:08.479 --> 00:34:12.116
EVEN MORE COSTLY SO- CERTAINLY-

00:34:12.183 --> 00:34:14.585
YOU KNOW WE CAN TRY TO BETTER

00:34:14.652 --> 00:34:17.021
IMPROVE- IN TERMS OF SUPPORT

00:34:17.088 --> 00:34:18.756
FUNDING FOR PURPOSE TO MOVE

00:34:18.823 --> 00:34:19.690
THINGS MORE QUICKLY THROUGH

00:34:19.757 --> 00:34:21.426
PURPOSE. BUT PURPOSE CERTAINLY

00:34:21.492 --> 00:34:23.428
A MUCH SUPERIOR WAY OF

00:34:23.494 --> 00:34:25.229
RESOLVING THESE DISPUTES THEN

00:34:25.296 --> 00:34:27.832
GOING TO THE COURTS AND THAT

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:29.767
THAT'S WHY BOTH MANAGEMENT AND

00:34:29.834 --> 00:34:32.737
LABOR BOTH- AT IN SAC ARE. AND

00:34:32.804 --> 00:34:36.073
THE LEBANESE REPRESENT TO

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:36.674
PLEASE BOTH ARE IN SUPPORT OF

00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:41.512
THIS BILL. OKAY SO THEIR ARMS

00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:43.247
SO THEY THEY DON'T MIND TAKING

00:34:43.314 --> 00:34:44.215
ON THESE ADDITIONAL

00:34:44.282 --> 00:34:46.184
RESPONSIBILITIES WITH THEIR

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:47.218
BACK I MEAN WHERE ARE THEY

00:34:47.285 --> 00:34:48.653
RIGHT NOW AS FAR AS THE BACKLOG

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:49.253
ARE STILL AT LEAST A PRETTY

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:52.190
BACK. BUT AGAIN I WOULD POINT

00:34:52.256 --> 00:34:54.325
OUT THAT THE- GOING TO THE

00:34:54.392 --> 00:34:55.560
COURT SYSTEM IS MUCH MORE

00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:58.229
COSTLY AND LESS TIMELY.

00:34:58.296 --> 00:34:59.497
ABSOLUTE GREEN FOR OF SYSTEM

00:34:59.564 --> 00:35:02.433
SO- SO WELL I DO RECOGNIZE

00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.968
THAT- THERE HAVE BEEN BACK UPS

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:06.204
AT PER BUT THEY'RE NOWHERE NEAR

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.239
WHAT. THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH.

00:35:08.306 --> 00:35:09.841
WITH THE COURT SYSTEM AS WELL

00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:11.142
AS AS I POINTED OUT EARLIER IN

00:35:11.209 --> 00:35:13.377
MY TESTIMONY. PURPOSE DESIGNED

00:35:13.444 --> 00:35:15.780
TO HANDLE THESE DISPUTES THE

00:35:15.847 --> 00:35:18.049
JUDGES. ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE

00:35:18.115 --> 00:35:19.617
LABOR LAW IF YOU GO TO THE

00:35:19.684 --> 00:35:21.786
COURT SYSTEM- YOU MADE END UP

00:35:21.853 --> 00:35:23.421
WITH THAT. NOW THE JUDGE MAY

00:35:23.488 --> 00:35:25.690
NOT HAVE THAT FAMILIARITY AND

00:35:25.756 --> 00:35:29.327
SO IT'S A MORAL. NO PROLONGED-

00:35:29.393 --> 00:35:30.328
BUT CONSTRUCTIVE PROCESS

00:35:30.394 --> 00:35:31.929
SOMETIMES AT AND GOING TO THE

00:35:31.996 --> 00:35:33.698
PUB SYSTEM SO THAT'S WHY BOTH

00:35:33.764 --> 00:35:36.267
MANAGEMENT AND LABOR- WANT TO.

00:35:36.334 --> 00:35:38.269
DO IS. USE THE PURPOSE SYSTEM

00:35:38.336 --> 00:35:39.337
IS THE WAY TO RESOLVE THEIR

00:35:39.403 --> 00:35:40.571
DISPUTES AND THAT'S IMPRESSIVE

00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:42.340
I ACTUALLY COMMEND AGREE WITH

00:35:42.406 --> 00:35:43.207
SENATOR LEARNED ON THAT

00:35:43.274 --> 00:35:45.076
ENDEAVOR I WAS JUST KIND OF

00:35:45.142 --> 00:35:45.943
CURIOUS AS TO THE STATUS AS THE

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:49.280
BACKLOG- PORTION OF. OF THE OF

00:35:49.347 --> 00:35:50.581
THE AGENCY IN FOR THEY WERE AS

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:52.617
FAR AS RESOLVING THAT ISSUE. I

00:35:52.683 --> 00:35:53.818
WOULD HAVE TO SINCE IT'S BEEN

00:35:53.885 --> 00:35:55.553
AWHILE SINCE I'VE CHAIRED THE

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.355
SENATE COMMITTEE I'D HAVE TO

00:35:57.421 --> 00:35:59.323
DEFER TO STAFF OR OTHER PEOPLE

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.058
AS TO WHAT THE EXACT STATUS OF

00:36:01.125 --> 00:36:05.763
THE- PROBATE. COURT SYSTEM IS

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:11.302
AT THIS POINT TIME. IT IS TO-

00:36:11.369 --> 00:36:12.370
SO MAKING IT BUT I DON'T THINK

00:36:12.436 --> 00:36:14.372
WE HAVE ANYONE PRESENT TO

00:36:14.438 --> 00:36:15.940
ANSWER THAT QUESTION. BUT WE DO

00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:19.677
NOT. HE TURNED BACK TO THE ONE

00:36:19.744 --> 00:36:20.878
OF THE LEAD WITNESSES IF INDEED

00:36:20.945 --> 00:36:22.813
THEY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:26.250
QUESTION BUT ABSENT THAT- HI.

00:36:26.317 --> 00:36:27.718
YES THEY DO IN FOR SOCIAL CARE

00:36:27.785 --> 00:36:29.287
TERRY BURN ABOUT HALF OF THIS

00:36:29.353 --> 00:36:30.788
YEAR YOU CALIFORNIA. I WOULD

00:36:30.855 --> 00:36:32.690
SAY YOU'RE RIGHT HISTORICALLY

00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:35.192
THE PER BOARD WAS BACKLOGGED IT

00:36:35.259 --> 00:36:36.761
WAS UNDERFUNDED FOR YEARS

00:36:36.827 --> 00:36:39.196
UNDERSTAFFED. IS MATTER OF FACT

00:36:39.263 --> 00:36:41.332
IT NEVER HAD A FULL CONTINGENT

00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:44.001
OF PER BOARD MEMBERS- IT FOR

00:36:44.068 --> 00:36:45.836
YEARS THERE WERE ONLY THREE AND

00:36:45.903 --> 00:36:47.772
SOMETIMES FOUR MEMBERS. THAT

00:36:47.838 --> 00:36:49.273
HAS BEEN RESOLVED IN THE BUDGET

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.842
PROCESS IN THIS LEGISLATURE

00:36:51.909 --> 00:36:53.477
OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS.

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:55.046
THEY'RE FULLY FUNDED FULLY

00:36:55.112 --> 00:36:57.615
STAFFED THE BACKLOG IS DIMINISH

00:36:57.682 --> 00:37:00.751
DRAMATICALLY- THOSE CASES THAT

00:37:00.818 --> 00:37:02.720
EXIST NOW THAT I'M AWARE OF

00:37:02.787 --> 00:37:03.721
THAT BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR MORE

00:37:03.788 --> 00:37:06.257
THAN A YEAR. OUR COMPLEX CASES

00:37:06.324 --> 00:37:08.759
NOT. A TICKET TO A PROBLEM WITH

00:37:08.826 --> 00:37:11.228
COMPLEXITY AND NOT STAFFING AND

00:37:11.295 --> 00:37:13.698
NOT BE A- NUMBER OF CASES

00:37:13.764 --> 00:37:15.566
COMING FORWARD. THE OTHER THING

00:37:15.633 --> 00:37:18.669
TO REMEMBER IS WHEN WE DID AB

00:37:18.736 --> 00:37:19.770
TWENTY EIGHT FIFTY LAST YEAR.

00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:22.440
THE BUDGET AMOUNT WHAT IS THE

00:37:22.506 --> 00:37:24.709
COST IN THE- PROBATE-

00:37:24.775 --> 00:37:27.511
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. WITH

00:37:27.578 --> 00:37:28.713
NINETY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:37:28.779 --> 00:37:30.181
AND THAT WAS JUST TO DRAFT THE

00:37:30.247 --> 00:37:32.016
REGULATIONS THEY HAD PLENTY OF

00:37:32.083 --> 00:37:35.453
STAFF AND TIME. TO ACCOMMODATE

00:37:35.519 --> 00:37:36.420
ONE OF THE LARGEST AGENCIES IN

00:37:36.487 --> 00:37:38.522
THE STATE. SO I CAN'T IMAGINE

00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:40.791
THAT THIS IS GOING TO CREATE A

00:37:40.858 --> 00:37:43.160
FURTHER BACKLOG OR ANYMORE-

00:37:43.227 --> 00:37:45.496
MUCH MORE WORK FOR A VERY

00:37:45.563 --> 00:37:47.465
EXPERTISE AGENCY AT THIS POINT.

00:37:47.531 --> 00:37:54.372
OKAY THEN I DID FIND HERE THE.

00:37:54.438 --> 00:37:54.972
INFORMATION I WAS SIGNED SAID-

00:37:55.039 --> 00:37:55.539
THEY IN OUR TO ADDRESS THE

00:37:55.606 --> 00:37:56.641
BACKLOG WAS ONE FOR FIVE

00:37:56.707 --> 00:37:57.808
MILLION- AS FAR AS THE TWO

00:37:57.875 --> 00:37:58.976
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND- BUDGET.

00:37:59.043 --> 00:38:00.177
AND THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED ONE

00:38:00.244 --> 00:38:01.579
POINT TWO MILLION I'M GOING AS

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:02.780
PART OF THE TWO THOUSAND

00:38:02.847 --> 00:38:03.381
NINETEEN AND TWENTY BUDGET TO

00:38:03.447 --> 00:38:05.016
CONTINUE REDUCING THIS BACKLOG

00:38:05.082 --> 00:38:07.351
I WAS JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS

00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:07.918
TO WHAT THE STATUS WAS ON ON

00:38:07.985 --> 00:38:15.326
THAT ENDEAVOR- OKAY SO

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:15.960
BASICALLY WHAT I'M

01:24:15.383 --> 01:24:17.285
PROBLEM IS WITH WITH THE

01:24:17.352 --> 01:24:19.554
ABSTRACT OF JUDGMENT PROCESS IS

01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:21.256
OFTEN SLOW. AND SO WHAT WE'VE

01:24:21.322 --> 01:24:22.657
DONE HERE IS WE'VE CREATED A

01:24:22.724 --> 01:24:24.859
CERTIFICATE OF LIEN. SO THAT

01:24:24.926 --> 01:24:25.894
RATHER THAN HAVING TO GO TO THE

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.729
COURTS IS OVER AGAIN THERE'S A

01:24:27.796 --> 01:24:29.831
FINAL JUDGMENT. WE'VE CREATED

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:32.100
CERTIFICATE PROCESS. AND THAT

01:24:32.167 --> 01:24:33.468
CERTIFICATE OFF PROCESS UNDER

01:24:33.535 --> 01:24:35.703
THIS LEGISLATION IS TO BE THAN

01:24:35.770 --> 01:24:37.739
ACCEPTED TO BE RECORDED. AND

01:24:37.806 --> 01:24:38.940
THEN OF COURSE THERE'S A

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:40.208
RELEASE PROVISION IF THAT

01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:42.310
MATTERS PAID. BUT WHAT ENDS UP

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:44.112
HAPPENING IS WE'VE SEEN PART

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:45.814
IT'S JUST SMART GOVERNMENT WE

01:24:45.880 --> 01:24:47.749
LEARN WE GROW AND WE GET BETTER

01:24:47.816 --> 01:24:49.651
AND WE LEARN HOW TO IMPROVE OUR

01:24:49.717 --> 01:24:50.885
PROCESS SEES. SECOND PIECES

01:24:50.952 --> 01:24:53.054
THAT SOME OF THESE BAD ACTORS

01:24:53.121 --> 01:24:55.790
BECAUSE IT TAKES SO LONG. TO

01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:57.125
ONCE THE FINAL JUDGMENT IS

01:24:57.192 --> 01:24:59.761
OBTAINED TO BE ABLE TO THEN.

01:24:59.828 --> 01:25:01.963
GET ABSTRACT THEY THEN TRANSFER

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:03.832
THE PROPERTY PRIVATE TIME TO

01:25:03.898 --> 01:25:06.034
TRANSFER THE TITLE BYRON TIME

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:06.768
TO THE RECORDATION OF THE

01:25:06.835 --> 01:25:09.237
ABSTRACT. AND SO THE SPEED IS

01:25:09.304 --> 01:25:11.005
CRITICAL ONCE A FINAL JUDGMENT

01:25:11.072 --> 01:25:13.141
IS OBTAINED. AGAIN THIS DOESN'T

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:14.175
DO ANYTHING AT ALL THE CHANGE

01:25:14.242 --> 01:25:15.877
