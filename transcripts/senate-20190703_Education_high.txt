AND WITH THAT WE WILL START WITH OUR FIRST AUTHOR MISTER JONES SAWYER WHICH IS ITEM. TO AB TWO FIFTY EIGHT BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWO FIVE EIGHT A BILL THAT WOULD USE FUNDS FROM PROP SIXTY FOUR YEAR MARK FOR TREATMENT AND PREVENTION. TO FUND SUSTAINABLE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS THIS BILL ADDRESSES THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SCHOOL SUPPORT SERVICES THE GRANTS CREATED BY THIS BILL WILL HELP FILL THE VOID IN A NUMBER OF SUPPORTIVE SERVICES STAFF. ALLEVIATE THE WORKLOAD OF ALREADY OVERWORKED TEACHERS AND CONNECT SCHOOLS TO EXISTING COMMUNITY RESOURCES. THE BILL IS STRUCTURED SUCH THAT GRANTS TO LEVERAGE ADDITIONAL FEDERAL RESOURCES SPECIFICALLY A MEDI CAL ELIGIBLE SERVICE. THE NEED FOR THIS BILL IS CLEAR AS EVIDENCED IN THE TEACHER STRIKES WE HAVE SEEN ACROSS THIS STATE. EDUCATORS STATEWIDE HAVE MADE CLEAR THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. CURRENT RATIOS OF SUPPORT STAFF ARE TERRIBLE WITH ONE COUNSEL FOR EVERY EIGHT SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE STUDENTS ONE NURSE FOR EVERY TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS AND ONE SOCIAL WORKER FOR EVERY NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED STUDENTS. OUR STUDENTS ARE FACING. STRESS AND TRAUMA AT UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS WITHOUT SUPPORTIVE SERVICES STAFF. AND PROGRAMS ON CAMPUS TO ATTEND THE THESE NEEDS WE CANNOT POSSIBLY EXPECT OUR STUDENTS TO SUCCEED. THIS BILL PROVIDES GRANTS THAT ALLOW SCHOOLS TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ON WHAT SERVICES BEST BIT THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS. FOR SOME THIS MAY MEAN TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. FOR OTHERS TRAINING FOR TEACHERS IN IDENTIFYING STUDENTS IN NEED OF TREATMENT. FOR OTHERS THE CREATION OF A SCHOOL BASED HEALTH CENTER MIGHT BE THE MOST SUPPORTIVE. WHICH STUDENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH THE SUPPORT OF SERVICES STAFF THAT THEY NEED WE SEE INCEASE CLASSROOM ENGAGEMENT BETTER ATTENDANCE IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS AND MOST IMPORTANT REDUCED DRUG USAGE RATES. GRAHAM IS MODELED AFTER A SIMILAR -- SOME REALLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM IN COLORADO WHICH ALSO SAW IT PICKED UP HEALTH PROGRAM RESULT IN BETTER PEOPLE DISCIPLINE DATA AS WELL AS SUSPENSIONS AND EXPULSIONS DECREASING AFTER IMPLEMENTATION WE OWE IT TO OUR STUDENTS TO PUT THEM IN THE BEST POSSIBLE POSITION TO SUCCEED. FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IS HELEN HELEN THOUSAND FROM TEACHERS FOR HEALTHY STICK HEALTHY KIDS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY OWNAGE GIRL NOT HELEN DOWN WITH CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION ONE OF THE COAST.

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IT INTO THE PROGRAM AND THAT'S WHY CTA IS SUPPORTING THE MEASURE IN AND LIVE IN HOPES OF INCREASING THE NUMBER OF STUDENT SUPPORT SERVICE PERSONNEL ON OUR CAMPUSES. PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. ONE REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA SCHOOL NURSES ORGANIZATION -- I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS I WOULD ONLY BRIEFLY SAY OUR SCHOOLHOUSE ISSUE IS ASSESSED ESSENTIALLY A HIDDEN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AND WE BELIEVE WITH THE ADVENT OF THIS GRANT PROGRAMS THAT -- I THINK WE'LL HAVE A A LARGER PICTURE ABOUT WHAT KINDS ISSUES CORN AND SCHOOL THE FACT THAT WE NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES PARTICULARLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KIDS DOING WELL IN SCHOOL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BETTER TEST SCORES. THEY NEED THE SUPPORT SERVICES AND SO WE ARE. ARE VERY PROUD TO BE THE CO SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION. VERY GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

COME RIGHT ON UP [inaudible] MORNING [inaudible] MIGHT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- TOM RENT FREE WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA -- WELL WE APPRECIATE THE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL WE DO HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED AT SOME LENGTH WITH THE AUTHORS STAFF -- THE FIRST WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE% LANGUAGE TO ENSURE THAT HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WORKING IN THESE PROGRAMS HAVE SOME EXPERTISE OR ADEQUATE TRAINING IN SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PREVENTION -- THE THE CURRENT. IN THE CURRENT FORM. THERE'S A DESCRIPTION OF THE SCHOOL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL MEANS AN INDIVIDUAL HOLDING A SERVICES CREDENTIAL WITH A SPECIALIZATION IN PUPIL PERSONNEL SERVICES. OR SERVICES CREDENTIAL WITH A SPECIALIZATION IN HEALTH FOR A SCHOOL NURSE BUT THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT THEY HAVE ANY SPECIALIZED TRAINING IN ENVIRONMENTAL PRIMARY OR SECONDARY SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PREVENTION WHICH IS AN ESTABLISHED FIELD OF WORK IN CALIFORNIA. AND THAT RELATES TO A SECOND CONCERN. WE THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER IF THE BILL LEVERAGE CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PREVENTION INFRASTRUCTURE CERTIFIED THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PREVENTION SPECIALISTS ARE ALREADY ACTIVE IN MANY SCHOOLS -- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE LANGUAGE ENCOURAGING THESE PROGRAMS TO COORDINATE WITH EXISTING PREVENTION ACTIVITIES RATHER THAN CREATING A SEPARATE STRUCTURE WHICH BYPASSES THE GOOD PREVENTION WORK THAT'S ALREADY -- BEING DONE AND WE THINK THAT WOULD MAKE FOR A MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF THE PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR FUNDS. HAVING SAID ALL THAT WE HAVE AN OVER OVER AN HOUR LONG A CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR STAFF YESTERDAY I THOUGHT IT WAS IT WAS HELPFUL AND PRODUCTIVE -- AND WE DO APPRECIATE THE THE WORK THAT AND THEM WORKING WITH US -- TO TRIED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING WORKING WITH THEM THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU.

LET ME JUST START WITH ONE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN NOW PRECLUDES ON ANY OF THAT FROM HAPPENING -- WE WANT TO WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT WE STRENGTH IN THAT -- LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE IN MY DISTRICT AT FREMONT HIGH SCHOOL THERE'S A HEALTH CENTER CALL MMHM. WHICH IS BOTH THE COUNTY. AND SCHOOL RESOURCES COMEY TOGETHER ON ONE CAMPUS PROVIDING DRUG REHABILITATION SERVICES FOR PREGNANT WOMEN SERVICE FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND THEY ALL HAVE BROUGHT THOSE ON CAMPUS. THAT'S MY VISION FOR WHAT THIS ULTIMATELY WILL BE IT WILL BE. WE CANNOT EXCLUDE THE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSION WE CAN'T EXCLUDE THE DRUG REHABILITATION INDIVIDUALS ON OUR CAMPUS WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND AND SO I WILL WORK VERY CLOSELY. TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENED BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW SOUTH LOS ANGELES. ARE WE EXPERIENCE EVERY. TYPE OF AILMENT POSSIBLE. IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM RIGHT NOW AND BECAUSE OF THE BUDGET CUTS BEFORE WE GOT HERE. WE JUST TOTALLY DECIMATED AT THAT THAT SUPPORT SERVICES I'M JUST TRYING TO USE MONEY TO BUILD IT BACK UP AGAIN AND I DEFINITELY WE CANNOT DO IT WITHOUT COUNTY RESOURCES EITHER. JUST A FOLLOW UP -- YEAH. I APPRECIATE THAT THERE ARE THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY DOING IT BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE OTHERS. ARE AND I'M NOT SAYING THERE THERE'S ANYTHING YOU KNOW BAD ABOUT THE MORE THAT BAD INTENTIONS IT JUST DOESN'T HAPPEN UNLESS.

COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY RELIANT UPON PART TIME I CHEN FACULTY WHO FACE LOW PAY A FEW BENEFITS A MINIMAL JOB SECURITY. PART TIME COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY ARE MOST AFFECTED BY REQUIREMENTS TO HOLD ADVANCED DEGREES BECAUSE SUCH AS MASTER'S AND PHD IS AS A RESULT THEY BEAR HEAVY BURDEN OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT. MOREOVER MANY AYE CHEN FACULTY MUST WORK THE EQUIVALENT FULL TIME HOURS BUT ACROSS MULTIPLE INSTITUTIONS THIS INCIDENT HINDERS THEIR ABILITY -- OF THEM TO BENEFIT FROM THE FEDERAL PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM. THIS BILL ATTEMPTS TO ELIMINATE THE BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE THAT PREVENTS THE OPPORTUNITY OPPORTUNITY A MANY OF THESE PART TIME AYE CHEN FACULTY FROM APPLYING TO THIS PROGRAM. THIS BILL REQUIRES COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO CREDIT PART TIME FACULTY IN PLACE WITH. THREE POINT THREE FIVE HOURS I WORKED FOR EACH HOUR OF LECTURE OR CLASSROOM TIME MAKING EASIER FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PART TIME FACULTY MEMBERS TO QUALIFY FOR THE PROGRAM. BY REMOVING THE ECONOMIC BARRIER THAT CURRENTLY PREVENTS THEM FROM SSE IN THE FEDERAL LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM THIS WILL ADDRESS THE TEACHER SHORTAGE BY ENCOURAGING COLLEGE GRADUATES TO SEEK CAREERS IN PUBLIC SERVICE AND PUBLIC HIGHER. EDUCATION IT IS A CRITICAL THAT WE ASSIST EDUCATORS WHO DEDICATE THEIR LIVES EVERY DAY TO THEIR STUDENTS. POLICY IN THIS BILL IS IMPERATIVE TO HELPING OUR PART TIME FACULTY WILL GIVE OUR EDUCATORS A FIGHTING CHANCE JUST TO APPLY FOR THIS FEDERAL LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM. I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER AYE VOTE WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY IS RON RAP BUT THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS.

FOUR SIX THREE AND I'D LIKE TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES FOR LEADERSHIP AROUND STUDENT THAT -- AS MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW STUDENT DEBT IN THIS COUNTRY IS ESTIMATED AT ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS IT IS MORE THAN CREDIT CARD DEBT AND CAR LOANS IT WOULD BE IT WOULD RANK NUMBER THIRTEEN IN TERMS OF GDP. IF WE CALCULATED IT THAT WAY. IT IS THE NEXT FINANCIAL CRISIS IN AMERICA. ACCORDING TO A RECENT SURVEY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE A. F. T. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE AVERAGE STUDENT DEBT FOR GRADUATE IS THIRTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. ALTHOUGH PART TIME COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY THAT I SPOKE TO HAVE MUCH HIGHER DEBT GIVEN THE REQUIREMENT TO HAVE AN ADVANCED DEGREE -- CONGRESS PASSED THE THE FEDERAL PUBLIC SERVICE LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TO PROVIDE FORGIVENESS OF CERTAIN TYPES OF STUDENT LOANS FOR GRADUATES WHO WOULD WHO AGREED TO WORK IN PUBLIC SERVER SERVICE OVER TEN YEARS AND MAKE TEN YEARS WORTH OF PAYMENTS. UNDER CERTAIN LOAN'S REPAYMENT PROGRAMS EDUCATORS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS CATEGORY. AB FOUR SIX THREE IS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT ADDRESSES THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG AS IT RELATES TO STUDENT DEBT COMMUNITY COLLEGE PART TIME FACULTY. THEY DEDICATE THEIR LIVES TO STUDENTS IN THE LARGEST COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY YET THEY'RE PAID SUBSTANDARD WAGES IN MOST CASES THEY DO NOT RECEIVE BENEFITS. AND DO NOT RECEIVE CREDIT FOR THE HOURS THEY SPEND OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM PREPARING LESSONS MEETING WITH STUDENTS -- GRADING PAPERS THUS THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR THE P. SLF PROGRAM. AB FOUR SIX THREE IS WRITTEN TO PROVIDE THESE PART TIME COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY WITH THE FEDERAL BENEFIT THAT WILL HELP THEM STAY IN A PROFESSION THEY HAVE CHOSEN ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT. OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE PART TIME FACULTY ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND A GATEWAY TO OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM -- I WANT TO RE TO JUST A COUPLE OF VIGNETTES FROM A COUPLE OF OUR MEMBERS THEY WROTE LETTERS OF SUPPORT. FOR A BI FOUR SIX THREE THESE ARE THESE ARE HEARTBREAKING -- STORIES THIS IS TAMMY I HAVE OVER A HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT YET I DO NOT QUALIFY FOR THE P. SLA PER P. SLF PROGRAM. AS A SINGLE PARENT OF A DISABLED CHILD I STRUGGLE TO MAKE ENDS MEET WORKING TWO PART TIME TO PART TIME JOBS IN TWO DIFFERENT CAMPUSES MAKES IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT. ESPECIALLY WITH THE PRICE OF GAS I SPENT A LOT OF TIME A PERSONAL UNPAID TIME ON SCHOOL RELATED PROJECTS AND WORKING WITH MY STUDENTS -- VALERIE CURRENTLY I OWE A HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN STUDENT LOANS. THE BALANCES BLOOM BECAUSE THERE WERE TIMES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THE PAYMENT SO I RESORTED TO FORBEARANCE IS AND HAVE HAD TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL FOR ADDITIONAL DEGREES FOR WORK PURPOSES. MY STUDENT LOAN PAYMENTS EXCEED MY MORTGAGE PAYMENTS AT THIS POINT. I SEE NO WAY OF PAYING OFF MY DEBT I LOSE A LOT OF SLEEP OVER THIS ISSUE I AM FIFTY FOUR YEARS OLD -- AND I WORK TWO JOBS IN ORDER TO TO MAKE MY PAYMENTS -- ON MY LOAN -- IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ONE MEMBER WROTE AN AYE VOTE ON A BEFORE SIX THREE TELLS US AS PART TIME FACULTY.

WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED ASSEMBLYMEMBER WOMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I JUST I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTES I THINK THAT WE CAN DO MUCH BETTER FOR OUR PART TIME I JEFF BAKUL. TO BY THE DESERVE MORE AND TO LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN DO THAT. VERY GOOD TANK YOU THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR PAN MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ITEM THREE AB FOR SIXTY THREE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS LEYVA AYE LEYVA AYE WILK. WILK I CHANGED TO WRESTLE. WITH US ALL AYE GLAZER MCGUIRE PAN PAN AYE. AS FOR VOTES AND LEAVE IT OPEN BELIEVE IT ON CALL AND YOU HAVE ALSO ITEM NUMBER NINE WHICH IS AB SEVEN TEN BEGIN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU AGAIN MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SUFFER LONG ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL SEVEN TEN TODAY ALSO WANT TO THANK AYE YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK ON THIS BILL. ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPONENT OF THE INCREASING COST TO RECEIVE A HIGH QUALITY POST SECONDARY EDUCATION IS THE COST OF HOUSING. IN THE RECENT YEARS A COST TO ATTEND COLLEGE HAS GROWN FOUR TIMES THE RATE OF INFLATION. AB SEVEN TEN SIX TO ENSURE THAT HOUSING COSTS FIGURES ACCURATELY REFLECT THE ACTUAL FINANCIAL NEED OF THE STUDENT AT THAT INSTITUTION. THIS BILL IS ABOUT DATA AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE COST OF HOUSING FOR STUDENTS NOTHING MORE NOTHING LESS THE DATA WE PROVIDE TO STUDENTS ON THE PERSPECTIVE COST OF ATTENDANCE IF. EXCUSE ME INFLUENCES OF THEIR CHOICE I THEY MAKE ABOUT WHICH COLLEGE THEY DECIDE TO ATTEND WHETHER OR NOT TO TAKE OUT LOANS TO PAY FOR THAT COLLEGE FOR THE HIGHER EDUCATION OR TO PURSUE. A HIGHER EDUCATION AT ALL. UNDER EXISTING LAW THERE IS NO STANDARD NO SYSTEM WIDE PROCESS TO CALCULATE HOUSING COSTS AT ANY HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION COLLEGES HAVE CONSIDERABLE DISCRETION IN THIS CATEGORY. WELL CS I WASI SACK HAS CONDUCTED A PILOT STUDENT EXACT -- EXPENSE AND RESOURCE SURVEY OTHER NINE OTHERWISE KNOWN AS SEARS FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THERE'S NO LEGAL REQUIREMENT FOR INSTITUTIONS TO USE THAT DATA OR OTHER SURVEYS AT ALL. FURTHERMORE THE STATE'S STUDENT EXPENSE AND RESOURCE SURVEYS HAVE NOT BEEN ACTIVE FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. THE LAST YEAR'S UPDATE WAS IN TWENTY EIGHT TWO THOUSAND SIX AND SEVEN SCHOOL YEAR ACADEMIC SCHOOL YEAR THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT SEARS WILL BE REINSTATED BY THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION OR THAT IT WILL STAY ACTIVE IN THE STATE IF THE STATE ENCOUNTERS DIFFICULT BUDGETARY CHALLENGES IN THE FUTURE. SURVEYS ALSO I DO NOT PROVIDE AN ACCURATE ACCURATE REFLECTION OF THE RESOURCES STUDENTS ACTUALLY NEED TO ATTEND COLLEGE THEY OFTEN PRESENT A DISTORTED IMAGE OF WHAT STUDENTS ACTUALLY SPEND WHEN THEY ARE FORCED TO DO -- MAKE DO WITH HE RESOURCES THE LIMITED RESOURCES THE COLLEGE STUDENTS ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF THEM ARE FOOD IN SECURE -- MANY GO TO EVENTS WHERE THERE IS FREE FOOD AND CARPOOL LANE IN ORDER TO AVOID TRANSPORTATION COSTS. ARE INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING SHOULD BE UPDATING THEIR HOUSING COSTS ON A FREQUENT BASIS IN ORDER TO KEEP UP WITH THE STATE'S EVER FLUCTUATING MARKET HOUSING MARKET. AB SEVEN TEN WILL HELP ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY REQUIRING INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING TO USE THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT -- DEVELOPMENTS MARKET FOR MARKET RATES I WHICH IS ACTUALLY VERY RELIABLE AND CONSISTENTLY PUBLISHED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. FIVE TO THE FAIR MARKET RENT SYSTEM FOR THE FOR OVER FORTY FIVE YEARS THIS IS BEEN IN PLACE THE FOR MARKET RENT DOUBT IS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE AND MORE ACCURATELY PORTRAYS THE COST OF HOUSING AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. NOT ONLY IS A FAIR MARKET RATE DATA MORE ACCURATE RELIABLY. UPDATED BUT USING ONE STANDARD TO CALCULATE COST OF HOUSING WILL ALLOW STUDENTS TO MAKE BETTER COST COMPARISONS BETWEEN INSTITUTE. INSTITUTIONS WHEN CHOOSING WHICH COLLEGE TO ATTEND. AB SEVEN TEN WILL HELP ALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ESPECIALLY FIRST GENERATION LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR HAVE MORE ACCURATE PICTURE OF A FINANCIAL RESOURCE THEY WILL MAKE. ALL THE WAY THROUGH THEIR COMMENCEMENTS ARE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IS MANY RODRIGUEZ -- EXCUSE ME AS MANY MERGING GUESTS FROM THE EDUCATION TRUST WES AND ALSO ADAM HAVE JAFFE FOR A STUDENT FROM UC DAVIS. GREAT SO UNDER COMMITTEE RULES TO SPEAKERS TWO MINUTES IN THIS BILL ENJOYS SUPPORT SUPPORT. AND MANY OF THE MORNING OKAY [inaudible] LIKE ON OKAY WE'RE NOT GONNA WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE THAT AWAY FROM YOUR TIME RIGHT. BENEVOLENT CHAIR WELL THAT'S GREAT. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS OUT OF MODESTY I'M AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT FROM UC DAVIS -- I'M A FINANCIAL AID RECIPIENT AND I AM ALSO THE XO WHAT'S PRESIDENT FOR THE UC DAVIS IN ASSOCIATION ON THE OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UC DAVIS OTHER OF SENATOR OF THE YOU SEE OF SOMEBODY -- I'M HERE TO TED TODAY TO TELL YOU THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY MONTHS WHERE I LOOKED AT MY BILL AND THOUGHT TO MYSELF MY GOD. I'M NOT GONNA MAKE MY RENT THIS MONTH THANKFULLY THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET A RECENT SURVEY AT UC DAVIS SHOWED THAT 18% OF STUDENTS HAVE BEEN HOUSING AND SECURE. AND 7% HAVE EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS AND WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT THOSE NUMBERS I THOUGHT TO MYSELF. I'M ONE OF THOSE THAT 18% AND THE THOUGHT OF NOT BEING ABLE TO PAY MY RENT ONE MONTH IS. TERRIFYING TO ME -- AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT TO US TO IN STATE STUDENTS RECEIVE FINANCIAL AID HOUSING IS THE BIZARRE BIGGEST COSTS OF IT BIGGEST CONSUMMATE IN ATTENDANCE -- OP I PAY MORE THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH FOR SINGLE ROOM IN A FOUR BEDROOM APARTMENT -- I'VE SPOKEN TO PEOPLE I REPRESENTED UC DAVIS WHO HAVE. NO INCOME -- CAN GET NO HELP FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND THEY HAVE CONSIDERED DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS MY OWN ROOMMATE. HAS MOVED GRADUATED RECENTLY TOLD ME THAT HE CONSIDERED DROPPING OUT AT LEAST FIVE OR SIX TIMES BECAUSE OF HOUSING COSTS -- AND KNOWING WHAT WE'RE GETTING OURSELVES INTO A KNOWING WHAT THE COST OF OUR HOUSING IS GOING TO BE ONE WERE SIGNING UP FOR OUR FOR FOR FOR THE UNIVERSITY -- AND THAT THAT COULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN AND HOW WE PROCEED WITH OUR EDUCATION -- AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY. IN THIS BILL. THANK YOU. PLEASE PROCEED GOOD MORNING BY SIR WILK AND SAID EDUCATION COMMITTEE MEMBERS MANY RODRIGUEZ FROM THE EDUCATION TRUST WEST -- TODAY WERE HERE TO EXPRESS OUR SUPPORT FOR AB SEVEN TEN A BILL THAT WILL ENSURE ACCURATE FAIR CONSISTENT HOUSING BY UTILIZING FAIR AND AND HOUSING URBAN DEVELOPMENT DATA. AS OPPOSED OUTDATED SURVEY SURVEY. ET W BELIEVES THAT THIS TRANSPARENCY IN ACCURACY IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR ALL STUDENTS BUT PARTICULARLY. FIRST HISTORICALLY DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER OR FRIEND WHO CAN HELP THEM NAVIGATE -- AFFORDING COLLEGE. IF OUR HIGHER ED INSTITUTIONS NOT DISCLOSE ACCURATE INFORMATION TO OUR STUDENTS AND PARENTS ON THE COST OF LIVING IN AN AREA. THEIR ULTIMATELY LEFT AT THE MERCY OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS INFORMATIONS AND STUDENTS WHO CAN BE MOST HARMED OR LOW INCOME STUDENTS FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS AND OTHER HISTORICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS. THIS BILL IS A STEP FORWARD TO HELP OUR STUDENTS AND PARENTS ACCESS ACCURATE DATA ENSURING THAT. WE ARE NOT UNDERESTIMATING OR OVERESTIMATING THE COSTS COLLEGE. IS FOR THESE REASONS RESPECTFULLY ASK BROUGH. THANK YOU ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. SAYING THAT ANY OF OUR OWN SURGERY SO THE CAR REPRESENTING THE CALL SIX IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. THERE'S ALWAYS. ONE NO IT'S FINE KNOW WHAT THIS OF I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT. IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. STATE NAME ORGANIZATION AND PLEASE PROCEED -- ALEX GRAYS WITH THE ICC REPRESENT THE PRIVATE NOT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES IN THE STATE AND WE DON'T HAVE AYE OPPOSED POSITION AT THIS TIME WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE WHEN IT THANK HEIR STAFF FOR THAT TIME BUT WE DO HAVE. A FEW CONCERNS I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT ON THIS BILL -- I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE QUESTION FOR US IS IS IS THE GOAL OF THIS THIS POLICY CONSISTENCY -- ACCURACY AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS WOUD CREATE A CONSISTENT MECHANISM FOR HOUSEHOLDS HAVE TO CALCULATE HOUSING BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE. THAT IT'S GOING TO BE MORE ACCURATE -- YOU KNOW OUR SCHOOLS DO WORK HARD TO SET THIS ACCURATELY WERE REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL RAGS TO TO SET IT IS ACTUALLY POSSIBLE FOR THE ACTUAL LIVING CONDITION OF WHERE STUDENTS GO TO SCHOOL -- AND YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO PROVIDE TWO EXAMPLES I THINK HIGHLIGHT ARE CONCERNED WITH PERHAPS THE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS. SO. UNDER THIS BILL -- ALL OUR INSTITUTIONS IN LA COUNTY WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE INSTITUTIONS IN LA COUNTY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO USE THE SAME HIGH DATA POINT AND SETTING. HOUSING A CALC ACOSTA TENANTS JUST BE CLEAR THIS IS SETTING BECAUSE WE TEND TO THE CEILING. THE OUR SCHOOLS CAN PROVIDE EIGHT UP TO THAT POINT WE CAN'T PROVIDED BEYOND THAT. SO THAT WOULD MEAN THAT FOR ALL OUR SCHOOLS LA COUNTY -- WE WOULD HAVE TO USE A FIGURE ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR DOLLARS THAT WOULD APPLY TO OUR SCHOOLS IN MALIBU IN WITH HERE IN PASADENA AND EVERYWHERE ELSE IN BETWEEN THE COUNTY -- IN OUR SCHOOLS ARE CONCERNED THEY ESPECIALLY LOOKING AT THE LOCAL HOUSING CONTACTS IN THE REGION THERE AND THAT THAT NUMBER MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST ACCURATE MEASURE. IN A COUNTY'S LARGEST LA. ANOTHER EXAMPLE -- IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY THAT FIGURE WOULD BE NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX DOLLARS FOR A ONE BEDROOM -- HOUSING AT LAST YEAR WHICH IS ONE REMEMBER INSTITUTIONS ARE CURRENTLY USING A NUMBER OF ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE DOLLARS -- SO IN ESSENCE WHAT THIS WOULD DO IS REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF AID BY ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN DOLLARS PER MONTH AT OUR SCHOOLS COULD PROVIDE. STUDENTS -- IN THAT AREA -- NET EFFECT BEING ABOUT FOURTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS LESS AN AIDE PER YEAR AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE YOU KNOW WE'RE DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM SO WE'RE USING A NUMBER MECHANISM SOME SCHOOLS LOOK AT SEARS AND JUST UPDATE HAVE BEEN UPDATING FOR INFLATION. SOME OF OUR SCHOOLS ARE ARE ANXIOUSLY AWAITING THE NEW SEARS DATA WHICH IS GOING TO BE MORE NUANCED AND LOCALIZED. OTHERS LOOK AT LOCAL HOUSING SURVEYS I EVEN OTHER SURVEYS WITH AND HIDE IT FOR EXAMPLE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY TALK ABOUT SIGNIFICANT VARIATION WITHIN REGIONS -- YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU'RE RIGHT NEXT TO A CAMPUS OR WHETHER YOU'RE IN A MORE RURAL AREA SO THOSE ARE OUR CONCERNS WE CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WORK HARD TO SET THIS IS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE CAUSES IMPLICATIONS FOR STUDENTS -- BUT THAT WE WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THAT THIS IS GOING TO LIMIT THEIR FLEXIBILITY TO CONSIDER LOCAL CONTACTS AND SET THAT NUMBER ACCURATELY THANKS. I FELT LIKE YOU FOR SECOND. ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. CASINO TO BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS AND CONCERNS. SENATOR DRAWS. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS SOME. THIS FORWARD COULD YOU RESPOND TO THE ISSUES RAISED -- ACTUALLY OUT MY QUESTION WAS A LITTLE BIT SIMILAR BUT I WAS GONNA ASK YOU TO GIVE ME A EXAMPLE OF A CONCRETE WAY IN WHICH THIS CHANGE. HOW WOULD THAT ACTUALLY IN A VERY SPECIFIC WAY HELP? STUDENTS UP BECAUSE I'LL HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT IT COULD ACTUALLY HURT. US STUDENTS AND I DON'T THINK THEY'RE DOING IT WITH MALICE SIR -- TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING WRONG SO COULD YOU THEY'RE SORT OF CONNECTED THERE UP STORY THANK YOU. WE HAVE DONE VERY THOROUGH RESEARCH ON MANY INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE STATE LOOKING AT THE UC DATA AND CAL STATE DATA FOR EXAMPLE HOW WE COMPARE THE UC COST OF ATTENDANCE FIGURES FOR OFF AGAIN THIS IS JUST FOR OFF CAMPUS HOUSING -- OFF HAS OFF CAMPUS HOUSING COSTS TO YOU SEE YOU THROUGH THE CSU SYSTEM I NEAR OR THE SAME COUNTY SAME REGION -- SO THAT WE CAN FIND COMPARISONS WE FOUND OUT THAT. WITHIN THE SEVEN COMPARISONS THAT WE DID ARGUE LOOK AT BERKELEY EAST BAY SANTA CRUZ MONTEREY BAY I RIVERSIDE SAMBAR DINO SAN DIEGO SAN DIEGO -- TWO CAMPUSES BURKE CLEAN UC SAN DIEGO HAVE HIGHER THAN THE CS USE OFF CAMPUS HOUSING FIGURES BALL THE OTHER FIVE HAVE LOWER OFF CAMPUS HOUSING THAN THE LOCAL CSU'S. SO WE DO SEE DISCREPANCIES I'M EVEN BETWEEN THE UC'S AND THE CS USE THAT ARE LITERALLY JUST MILES APART FROM EACH OTHER. AND SO WHAT WE WIND TO IS THAT WE WANT JUST TO HAVE AN ACCURATE ASSESSMENTS TO STUDENTS CAN MAKE THE BEST FINANCIAL -- CHOICE WHEN IT AFFECTS IT COULD -- YOU KNOW. THE FACT HOW MUCH ONCE A TAKE OUT. DO THEY NEED TO TAKE OUT MORE LOANS DO THEY TAKE OUT LESS LOANS AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WANT TO ADDRESS STUDENT DEBT WE DON'T WANT STUDENTS TO INCUR MORE DEBT THAN NEEDED -- BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT THEM TO GET A STRONG FINANCIAL PACKAGE -- THAT COULD HELP THEM COVER THESE COSTS AND WHEN THEY'RE DECIDING WHICH INSTITUTION TO GO TO THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT WILL MY FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE COVER WHAT WHAT I NEED TO PAY. OUT OF POCKET AND THEN TURNING -- TO STUDENT LOANS AND UNFORTUNATELY WE THAT'S ALREADY A CRISIS THAT WE FACE NATION WIDE SO AFTER DOING THOROUGH RESEARCH -- WE FOUND OUT THE FEDERAL HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT HAS CREATED THIS FAIR MARKET RATE EACH YEAR SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR UPDATING THAT LIST -- BECAUSE SEVERAL SERVICES RELY ON THIS HIGH DATA ALREADY ACROSS THE NATION AND ITS UPDATED ANNUALLY WITH CENSUS TRACKS AT ITS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE TO ANYONE. I SO YOU DON'T AYE WE HAVE ACTUALLY SPOKEN -- TO THE OPPOSITION AT LANES AND WERE ALWAYS OPEN AND WILLING TO FIGURE OUT A PATH FORWARD OR IF THERE ISN'T AN EASY NESS WHERE THEY FILLED IT STUDENTS WOULD BE AFFECTED IN ANY WAY THAT IS CERTAINLY NOT WHAT WE EVER WANT HAPPY NIGHT. I FEEL LIKE I RESISTED IT THE OTHER DAY TEN YEARS AGO I GRADUATED FROM UC RIVERSIDE -- AND AND THE COST OF HOUSING I CONTINUES TO BE A NUMBER ONE CONCERN FOR STUDENTS AND SO ALL WE'RE LOOKING FORCE TRANSPARENCY. ACCURACY AND THE CONSISTENCY -- THAT EVERY UNIVERSITY PUBLIC PRIVATE TAKE [inaudible] YOU'RE SATISFIED. OKAY GREAT DOCTOR PAN. THANK YOU AND CENTER CERVANTES EMMA YEAH I THANK YOU I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE. BUT I THINK THAT -- WITH LOOK AT SEARS IN THESE BASED ON ANALYSIS I MEAN IT'S DONE TRY ANNUALLY I THINK THE FACT ALTHOUGH EVEN THOSE SUPPOSEDLY EVERY THREE YEARS THE LAST ONES LIKE TEN YEARS SO THAT. THAT'S A BIT DISTURBING THE TERMS OF SAYING THAT THAT SHOULD BE USED AS THE MAIN BENCHMARK WHICH I THINK IS. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS BILL. HIDE IS UPDATE MORE RECENTLY BUT ONE HEARING FOR THE OPPOSITION IT MAY NOT BE GRANULAR ENOUGH RATES OF THE REGION'S VERY LARGE -- AND YOU'RE AVERAGING OUT THEN THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT DEPENDING ON WHERE THE CAMPUS IS A BABY AN AREA WHERE HOUSING IS MUCH MORE COSTLY THAN THE AVERAGE AND OTHER AREA WHAT. SO -- YES -- SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IS THAT -- YOU KNOW GIVEN WHAT THE OPPOSITION'S REYES I KNOW YOU'VE WORKED VERY HARD ON THIS BILL I THINK. YOU KNOW HOW THE TIDE VARIETY MUCH MORE RECENT INFORMATION IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S OF PERHAPS STILL A BETTER BASS LINE. DO YOU SEE FOR EXAMPLE -- AT AT IN YOUR BILL PERHAPS. TREATING SOME KIND OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CAMPUS TO BE ABLE TO IN THAT BECAUSE THAT YOU WRITE THESE IT TRIES FINANCIAL AID A BUNCH OF OTHER THINGS -- AND IN TERMS OF BEGAN TRYING FRIDAY TRANSPARENCY ACCURATE INFORMATION -- SOME ABILITY FOR CAMPUSES TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS USING THE MOST RECENT SEARS TO THE HEAD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT THAT THAT MIGHT GIVE A BETTER IDEA WHAT'S LOCALLY I I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DEAL THE GRANULARITY ISSUE THAT WAS -- I THINK SORT OF RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION AND BY ALSO APPRECIATE THAT WELL CERTAINLY THE SURVEY MAY SOUND LIKE IT'S WHAT IF YOU'RE ONLY DOING IT EVERY THREE YEARS THE HOUSING MARKET CAN CHANGE A LOT THREE YEARS SAYS THE LAST ONE WAS ALMOST TEN YEARS EVEN THEY SUPPOSED TO DO. IT EVERY FEW YEARS IT DOESN'T SOUND TO ME TO BE VERY VERY RELIABLE AND SO WE JUST DOING A PERCENTAGE ADJUSTMENT. THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE AN ACTOR REFLECTIONS GOING ON THE HOUSING MARKET IT'S SO. I'D MAYBE CAN SPEAK TO FOR YOU SEE. DO YOU SEE THE BILL GOING AND YELLED. AS A MOVES FORWARD THAT -- MAKING ANY SORT OF WIGGLE ROOM THERE ARE ARE NOT I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE GIVEN WHAT THE EXPENSE SPECS. BY THE OPPOSITION HERE NO THANK YOU SENATOR SO MUCH SO WE CERTAINLY -- WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND IF THERE'S A WAY FOR WE CAN ADDED A PROVISION LANGUAGE AND THAT WOULD MAKE THEM FEEL. BETTER IN ADDRESSING THAT GRANULAR PORTION -- WE ARE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN. CERTAINLY OPEN TO THAT ONLY BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY THIS IS GOING TO POSITIVELY AFFECT EVERY STUDENT WHEN THEY'RE DECIDING WHICH CHOICES TO MAKE. OUR FOR THEIR FUTURE AND SO WE ARE THAT IS MY FAITH -- MY COMMITMENTS. TO THE BODY TODAY OKAY AND AN APPRECIATE SO YOU BRING THIS BILL FOR BECAUSE I THINK THAT YOU'RE DRESSING UP THE REAL PROBLEM WHERE SPECIALLY IF THERE'S NOT. WE TALK ABOUT ACCURACY AND SO FORTH -- IF. THE SURVEY NEEDS TO BE DONE MUCH MORE CONSISTENTLY TO WE'RE GOING TO USE THAT AND EVEN AS AN ADJUSTER SO -- WITH THAT -- I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON MAYBE REFINING SOME OF THESE ASPECTS OF BEHALF IN WAS BUILT APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU CENTER PAN ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THERE MCGUIRE PAN. PAN AYE. ALL RIGHT THE BILL HAS FOUR VOTES BUT WE WILL KEEP IT ON CALL FOR OTHER MEMBERS.

THE BILL WILL ALSO PROVIDE CRITICAL SUPPORT FOR STAFF TRAINING STUDENT ENGAGEMENT RECIPE DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER ASSISTANCE NEEDED TO HELP SCHOOL SUCCESSFULLY SERVE PLANT BASED OPTIONS. THIS ACT WILL ULTIMATELY ACCOMPLISH THE FOLLOWING THREE GOALS ONE ASSISTS SCHOOLS TO EXPAND THEIR AVAILABLE FOOD AND BEVERAGE CHOICES. TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTHY PLANT BASED OPTIONS FOR LOW INCOME. COMMUNITIES AND THREE ACCOMMODATE STUDENTS WITH RELIGIOUS OR CULTURAL MEANS. TO BE CLEAR AB FOR SEVENTY NINE DOES NOT TELL SCHOOLS TO STOP SERVING MEAT OR DAIRY. AB FOR SEVENTY NINE WILL SIMPLY EMPOWER OUR SCHOOLS TO RETHINK THE FOOD THEY OFFER TO SUPPORT A BALANCED DIET -- I WANT TO THANK YOUR STAFF -- MADAM CHAIR OF FOR WORKING WITH US TO CLARIFY SOME OF THE LANGUAGE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. WITH ME IN SUPPORT OUR A JENNIFER LE BAR FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND JUDY MANN QUEUE SO FROM SOCIAL COMPASSION AND LEGISLATION. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WILL YOU BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. THERE ARE NONE OKAY VERY GOOD THANK YOU MY LANGUAGE YES PERFECT THANK YOU SIR. WELCOME I EACH OF YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN LEYVA AND HIS TEAM MEMBERS OF THE SENATE EDUCATION COMMITTEE I'M JENNIFER LE BAR WITH SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. I'VE SPENT THE LAST TWENTY ONE YEARS OPERATING URBAN SCHOOL FOOD SERVICE SYSTEMS IN CALIFORNIA. THE SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAMS PROVIDE A RELIABLE AND MUCH NEEDED SOURCE OF HEALTHY MEALS FOR CHILDREN. DUE TO LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OFTEN ONLY HAVE A DOLLAR TWENTY FIVE TO PAY FOR THE ENTREE FRUIT VEGETABLE IN MILK THAT WE MUST SERVE TO OUR STUDENTS. DUE TO THIS WE ARE NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO PROVIDE THE TYPES OF FOODS THAT ARE CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE. FOR EXAMPLE WE CAN AFFORD TO PROVIDE MILK ALTERNATIVES AS A CHOICE FOR STUDENTS AND ONE OF VAST NUMBER OF YOUR STUDENTS ARE LACTOSE INTOLERANT WE ARE HIS MISSING THE MARK. AB FOUR SEVEN NINE WOULD HELP OFFSET MANY OF THE SCHOOL FOOD SERVICE EXPENSES INCURRED WITH OFFERING MORE PLANT BASED OPTIONS. AND IT WOULD ALLOW SCHOOLS TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND THESE MEALS WHICH ARE GOOD FOR BOTH THE CHILDREN'S MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING. I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO SUPPORT AB FOUR SEVEN NINE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD MORNING I'M JUDY MAN CREW SO PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER IS SOCIAL COMPASSION AND LEGISLATION AND A PROUD CO SPONSOR THIS BILL. I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT CHILDREN'S HEALTH ACCORDING TO THE CDC AND NINE OUT OF TEN YOU AS CHILDREN DON'T EAT ENOUGH VEGETABLES AND 70% OF CALIFORNIA KIDS FALL SHORT.

AND IT IS PROJECT AT ONE IN THREE WILL HAVE DIABETES IN THEIR LIFETIME THESE ARE SHOCKING NUMBERS AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE KIDS THAT DON'T LEARN HEALTHY HABITS THEY GROW UP AND NEED LOTS AND LOTS OF HEALTH CARE. CHRONIC DISEASES RELATED TO OUR DIET NOW ACCOUNT FOR SEVEN IN TEN U. S. DOES 90% 90% OF OUR ANNUAL THREE POINT FIVE TRILLION HEALTH CARE EXPENSES. ARE FOR PEOPLE WITH AT LEAST ONE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITION SUCH AS OBESITY DIABETES OR HEART DISEASE -- AS JENNIFER MENTION CHILDREN ARE LACTOSE INTOLERANT CANNOT DRINK CALLS MILK TODAY THEY HAVE NO CHOICE IF A CHILD NEEDS TO E. PLANT BASED FOR THEIR HELP ARE SIMPLY BECAUSE THAT IS THEIR DIETARY CHOICES.

MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JUST OLD FILLED WITH THE CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION -- IN ADDITION TO THE CALIFORNIA CATTLEMEN'S ASSOCIATION. ALSO HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF WESTERN NINETY DURING AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE NEUTRAL IN THE BILL WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION THANKS TO THE WORK OF THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE. AND THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING AMENDMENTS IN THE FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS. WE DO BELIEVE HOWEVER IS IMPORTANT BE ON RECORD THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS WITH AMENDMENTS MADE FOLLOWING FIRST POLICY COMMITTEE. THAT WE WERE MADE WITHOUT OUR KNOWLEDGE OR CONSERVE OUR CONSULTATION. HELLO PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS TO FUND IMPLEMENTATION. WITH THIS COULD RESULT IN A ROLL OUT OF A PROGRAM THAT IS BIASED AND PROMOTED BY UNSUBSTANTIATED INFORMATION BY INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE. MOTIVES OTHER THAN PROMOTING THE BEST ATTRITION FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. ORGANIZATIONS ARE SUPPORTIVE OF CHOICE. HOWEVER WE ALSO SIX PROMOTE A BALANCED DIET INCLUDES PROPER NUTRITION BASED SCIENCE. WRITERS AND DAIRY PRODUCERS ARE CRITICAL IN PROVIDING THE PROTEIN VITAMINS AND CALCIUM OR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN REQUIRED DAILY BASIS TO EXCEL IN IN SCHOOL WE APPRECIATE THE ABILITY TO CONTACT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER. IN BETWEEN THEIR OPPOSITION SEEING THAT WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS. SEEING AND WE HAVE A MOTION SIR A SENATOR WILK. I'M CO AUTHOR THE BILL'S SAW BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT CAN YOU CAN YOU DRESS THE OF THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY MISTER -- FILLED HER I WE HAD WORKED TOGETHER AND WE HAD TAKEN AMENDMENTS SO THAT AG WE COULD ALLEVIATE SOME OF THEIR CONCERNS. MY GOAL IS NOT TO REPLACE ME AS I HAD DISCUSSED WITH THEM MY MICHAEL SURELY WISH TO ENSURE THAT SCHOOLS ARE OFFERING. CHOICES TO STUDENTS SO THAT WE HAVE -- GENERATIONS OF YOUNG ADULTS GROWING BECOMING BETTER INFORMED ABOUT. NUTRITIONAL VALUE AND ALSO BEING AWARE OF FOOD CHOICES -- BECAUSE ESPECIALLY IN MANY OF OUR POOR COMMUNITIES STUDENTS DO NOT HAVE THE BENEFIT OF THAT -- AND AND THIS IS WHERE PRIMARILY THIS BILL IS TARGETING. AND AMONGST OTHER THINGS THAT IT I THINK HELPS IN THE LONG TERM ADDRESS. AND AND SO WHEN SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE. ADDRESSED AND DISCUSSED SINCE THEN I I DO WANNA SAY BELIEVE WE'VE BEEN AND CONTINUED COMMUNICATION -- BUT I GUESS BUT SOME OF THE LANGUAGE HAVING TO DO WITH. VARIOUS SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS ON BEHALF OF THE BILL -- WHO MAY RUN CONTRARY TO SOME OF THE INTERESTS? THAT THAT THAT'S CONTRIBUTING TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS CARE. THAT'S I HOPE I ANSWERED YOUR QUESTION. NOT REALLY -- SO HE SAID THAT HE SO IT WAS IMMEDIATELY BE MORE SPECIFIC QUE THANKS. YOU CAN. END UP HAVING MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT SUPPORT. A BILL. AND SOME OF THE ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED MAY BE IN DIRECT CONTRAST THING VIEWPOINT. WITH FORMER OPPOSITION. I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE CONCERN IS COMING FROM NOT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT. SOME OF THE SET UP OF WITH THE POTENTIAL PRIVATE FUNDS BEING USED. TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THIS BILL -- I THINK THERE'S CONCERN THAT WELL HOW WILL THESE FUNDS BE USED AND WHAT. DOCTOR AND WILL THEY BE UTILIZING THAT IN SCHOOLS EIGHT THAT'S WHERE THE CONCERN IS COMING FROM. WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN MAY I BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHO EVEN MAKES THAT DECISION OF SOME WAS A PRIVATELY FUNDED FOR SCHOOLS HOW DOES HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK. IF WHO MAKES THE DECISION. BECAUSE IT. CAN YOU CAN YOU. COME TO THE MIKE THERE YEAH. A LOOK AT A YOU WHO ELSE WILL BE LOOKING. SHISEIDO. YOUR GOOD IT'S ON THANK YOU. SO -- OUR UNDERSTANDING IS IS THE MAN AND WHAT WAS PUT IN TO ALLOW -- PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS TO PROVIDE FUNDS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OKAY TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM. I THINK OUR CONCERN IS AND I THINK WE'VE WE'VE EXPRESSED THE CITY OFFERS OFFICE SENSES AMENDMENTS WERE MADE. THAT THERE'S REALLY NO GUARANTEE. THAT THERE IS WON'T BE -- YOU KNOW ANY ANY BIAS OR INFORMATION THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY NUTRITION BASED -- THAT THAT WILL BE USED TO PROMOTE THAT MOVING FORWARD -- BEYOND -- YOU KNOW THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM IN THIS PRIVATE FUNDS UTILIZED -- IT'S IT'S JUST A VERY BROAD PROVISION THAT'S IN THE BILL THAT SIMPLY ALLOWS THEM TO ACCEPT PRIVATE FUNDS TO REIMBURSE SCHOOLS. THAT CHOOSE -- TO TO USE -- TO USE THIS OPTION SO I GUESS PART OF IT IS ALSO JUST THAT THE FOR THE FACT THAT -- THE PROVISION IS VERY BROAD WITH REALLY NO CONSTRAINTS OR FOR OR LIMITING FRAME FOR LIVING AROUND THE FRAMEWORK. THAT PROVIDES US WITH WITH THAT CONCERN MOVING MOVING FORWARD IF THE AUTHOR SO INCLINED WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO CONTINUE HAVE DISCUSSIONS ON THAT YEAH I THINK WE HAVE AND WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE SENSE ABOUT ARC THAT CONCERNED -- SO FAR THERE'S NOT BEEN A DESIRE TO ADDRESS THAT CONCERN BUT IF THERE WAS AT SOME POINT -- WE WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY WILLING TO SIT DOWN AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST WE HAVE BEEN. OPERATING AND GO SHOOTING GOOD FAITHON THIS BILL AND SO I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE OPEN TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR I DO BELIEVE THAT IT'S C. D. E. THAT WOULD MAKE THE DECISION. YEAH CAT IF THAT WOULD HELP YEAH JUSTIN SAID THAT OKAY. GOOD ASSEMBLY SENATOR DRUG SO. YEAH I I'M NOT SURE HOW TO IF THERE'S A FIX FOR THIS BUT ONE THING THAT THE GENTLEMAN SAID THAT DID. GET MY ATTENTION IS THAT DOES THIS BECOME A BIAS -- YOU KNOW AGAINST OTHER FOODS -- AND I WOULD BE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT IT'S ONE THING TO ACCOMMODATE AND PROVIDE CHOICES BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN I GO TO CERTAIN GROCERY STORES AND MY COMMUNITY. WE ARE NOT PROVIDED THE CHOICES AND FRANKLY I DO A MIX OF THINGS YOU KNOW IT'S A TRY TO GET MORE. VEGETABLES YEAR IN THERE AND ALL THAT BUT I DO GET A MIX UP I LIKE THE CHOICES AND SO I WOULD WANT THIS TO BECOME THAT WERE. SLOWLY MOVING IN WITH CERTAIN FOODS AND A TO THE DETRIMENT OF NOT OFFERING OTHER FOODS SO AND I THAT. COULD HAPPEN I MEAN THERE'S VERY -- SERIOUS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FOR EXAMPLE A BUDGETARY AND BE GOOD AND THEN MEAT EATERS SO. THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE BUT I I APPRECIATE THAT. THIS IS ALSO ADDRESSING RELIGIOUS AND CULTURAL ISSUES AND CONCERNS SO. I'M FOR IT BUT I WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF THE NINE OTHER FOODS -- IN THIS PROCESS. THANK YOU SO. LET ME LET ME JUST. TRY. TO GIVE A AS AS SPACE BRIEF OF A RESPONSE. PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH THIS IS CHANGE A CULTURE. BECAUSE WHAT'S BEEN INSTITUTIONALIZED OVER TIME. ARE CERTAIN TYPES OF FOODS THAT HAVE BEEN -- SUBSIDIZED BY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND HAVE BEEN INSTITUTIONALIZED IN THE PROCESS. NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF A LARGE GROWING POPULATION SOME OF THOSE EFFORTS NEEDED TO BE PUT INTO PLACE. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT ONCE THAT HAPPENS. THEN OVER TIME SOME THINGS ARE NEGLECTED. AND SO THIS IS AN EFFORT TO TRY TO JUST DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS. AND FOR CHILDREN SCHOOL AGE STUDENTS TO BECOME BETTER INFORMED ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE CONSUMING. IT'S NOT EVEN FORCING THEM. TO EAT IT IF THEY CHOOSE NOT TO THEY DON'T HAVE. TO IT'S BASICALLY. FOR REQUIRING SCHOOLS AT LEAST OFFER THE OPTION. SO THAT THEN STUDENTS CAN BE BETTER INFORMED AND KNOW FOR THEMSELVES IF THEY WANT TO PARTICIPATE OR NOT. THAT'S REALLY THE GOAL NOW. PRIVATELY FUNDING SOMETHING WE CONSTANTLY DO THAT WE CONSTANTLY GET INTO PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. IN ORDER BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS THAT. OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND SO WE USUALLY SET UP A PILOT PROJECT PROJECT AND WE GARNER PRIVATE SUPPORT SO THAT WE CAN HELP. MOVE OR ADVANCE A CERTAIN ISSUE FORWARD THIS IS. THIS IS BASICALLY DOING THAT WHAT'S ALLOWING FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. MINOR OFFER SOMETHING AS AN OPERATIONAL POINT OF VIEW OUR JOB IS TO FEED. STUDENTS AND IF WE ARE CREATING A SYSTEM THAT DOES NOT SATISFY THE NEEDS OF ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. THEN THAT'S WHEN WE'RE FAILING AND SO RIGHT NOW WE STRUGGLE TO DO THAT INTO OLD EMILY WE'RE STILL GOING TO BE PROVIDING FOOD THAT EVERY CHILD WANTS IN THIS IS ASSISTING US TO MEET THE MARK WHERE WERE MISSING IT. AND SO. TO SAY THAT THIS WILL SUPPLANT OR REMOVE OTHER TYPES OF PROTEIN SOURCES THAT'S NOT IN OUR BEST INTERESTS IN IT'S NOT IN OUR STUDENTS BEST NTEREST. BUT WE NEED TO ADD TO THAT AND SO THAT WE CAN DO THOSE CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE. ITEMS FOR OUR STUDENTS TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. I'D LIKE TO ACT AS ONE THING THE PENDULUM HAS BEEN SWUNG ALL THE WAY TO ONE SIDE WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET IT TO COME. IT SOMEWHERE EVEN NEAR THE MIDDLE [inaudible] SO. YOU KNOW AS A VEGAN FOR TWENTY NINE YEARS. WE ARE MORE OR LESS DISCRIMINATED AGAINST BY NOT HAVING FOOD CHOICES SO IT'S JUST GIVING PEOPLE CHILDREN THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT CHOICE AND TO MAYBE START OFF. ON THE RIGHT FOOT THAT THEIR PARENTS WANT THEM TO HAVE THAT THE DOCTOR WANTS THEM TO HAVE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR RUSSELL GOOD OKAY CENTER PAN. THANK YOU SUGGEST JUST TO CLARIFY THE PRIVATE FUNDING WOULD GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND IT'S ONLY TO HELP PAY FOR THE PLANT BASED DIET IT'S NOT TO FIGHT AND I THINK EDUCATION OR OTHER TYPES OF I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT EXACTLY WE SAID PRIVATE FUNDING WHAT. EXACTLY ARE YOU YES BY THE FUNDING FOR IT BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND IN THE BILL WERE CREATING A FUND TO HELP. SUPPORT AND THEY HAVE SCHOOL THIS XP ABLE TO PAY FOR PLANT BASED. FOODS BECAUSE THEY MAY COST A LITTLE MORE FOR SOME REASON -- SO IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THAT CORRECT IS IN THE THE MONEY DOESN'T GET ANYTHING ELSE. RIGHT. POLICE THE CELL. NO THE THE WELL THE THE PROGRAM DOES HAVE A GRANT PROGRAM FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES AND RECIPES AND EIGHT SO THAT AND THAT SINISTER BY C. D. E. S. OKAY. AND C. E. WOULD HAVE THE CHOICE TO ACCEPT OR REJECT THE FUNDS I YES I WOULD JUST YES I DON'T HAVE A PRESCRIPTION IT'S NOT PRESCRIBE WHAT MONEY THEY CAN TAKE OVER NOT SO. IT WOULD BE THEIR CHOICE OKAY I MEAN I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS IS THAT -- CD NEEDS TO HAVE THE ABILITY. TO IF YOU RECEIVING FIRE FUNDS TO MAKE JUDGMENTS ABOUT IS IT ASKING THE PART OF EDUCATION TO FOR FORD LET'S SAY I DON'T THOUGH I KNOW THIS IS NOT THE DESIRE OF YOUR BILL OR TO SPONSORS BUT IF SOMEONE SAYS WELL I'M WILLING TO GIVE A MILLION DOLLARS. TO SEE E. SO THAT EVERY SO THAT STUDENTS SINCE PARTICULAR SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR SOMETHING OR TOLD THAT. YOU KNOW MEAT IS POISON. SO IT'S NOT CONDITIONAL OKAY THAT THAT'S IF IF I'M UNDERSTAND OKAY YOUR CONCERN BY IT'S ANOTHER WITHOUT CD NEEDS ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO SAY THIS THE FOREVER PROGRAM WERE EXTEND OUR FOR MIKE IT TAKING ACCEPTING FUNDING FROM AND THEN GRANTING. TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS IS GONNA BE MEET THEIR STANDARDS FOR ACCURACY AND AND AND SO FORTH I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S THE NIGHT STATE COULD BE COMPELLED TO TAKE EXCEPT FUNDS. AND THEN HAVE TO TEACH STUDENTS SOMETHING THAT'S INACCURATE THAT THE CITY WOULD NOT VIEW IS APPROPRIATE OR ACCURATE. I THINK THAT'S RIGHT. I AM PRETTY SURE THAT'S WHAT YOU INTEND I JUST ONE OF THE I THINK THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT SEEMS TO BE FLOATING OUT THERE IT'S ONE BE SURE THAT'S THAT'S CLEAR RIGHT. YES CD HAS THE DISCRETION RIGHT SO THEY CAN ACCEPT THE FUNDS THEY CANNOT ACCEPT THE FUNDS IF IF ONE THE CONDITIONS OF THE FUND IS. TO PROVIDE AN ACCURATE INFORMATION IN THEIR VIEW IT'S AN ACCURATE SO THAT THEY CAN DECLINE DAY WILL BE ABLE TO CLIMB THAT. YES OKAY ALL RIGHT RIGHT DOES THAT AND I GUESS -- I WOULD ASK -- PDD TWEENER AS IS IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING AS WELL IN THAT YES I THINK THAT YOU AND I SHOULD HAVE QUALIFIED THIS EARLIER AND I MY APOLOGIES I THINK IT AGAIN IT'S NOT. FOR THE NECESSARILY THE THE I REIMBURSABLE OF OF OF THE PRODUCT ITSELF. IT'S THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE BILL IT'S THE ADVERTISING ITS THE EDUCATION THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT SO I THINK IN IN THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU PROVIDED -- YOU KNOW AS IS PART OF THE DONATION THAT IS TO CD THAT COMES WITH. YOU KNOW A TYPE OF PROMOTIONAL ACT YOU KNOW MATERIAL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT'S JUST NOT SPELLED OUT TO I GUESS OUR TO RELIEVE THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE THAT THERE MIGHT BE -- YOU KNOW INFORMATION THAT'S THAT'S DISTRIBUTED WITH THAT PRODUCT WHICH AGAIN THE INTENT I UNDERSTAND IS TO PAY FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT OF THE MEAL BUT BECAUSE THE BILL GOES BEYOND THAT. THAT'S REALLY THE HEART OF OUR CONCERN I AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT -- OKAY BUT THAT BUT I THINK AS THE AS I THE AUTHORS ANSWERED. CITY HAS THE DISCRETION THEREFORE TO TO EXERCISE THAT DISCRETION WHETHER TO ACCEPT THE FUNDS AIR. IF THEY FEEL THAT WHATEVER EDUCATION ADVERTISING GOES WITH THE SUIT IS AN APPROPRIATE OR IS INACCURATE. THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY NO WE DON'T ACCEPT THOSE FUNDS BECAUSE WE CAN'T ACCEPT THOSE CONDITIONS NICE OKAY. THANK YOU. YES. I DON'T WANT TO ELABORATE THE POINT BUT IF WE WERE GONNA WRITE BILLS WITH ALL THE INTENSE OF WHAT WE DON'T WANT SOMETHING TO DO I THINK THE BILLS WOULD BE. OF THE VERY PRESCRIPTIVE AND VERY LONG AND SO THAT SO. THIS IS NOT TO DISPARAGE IN ANYWAY BUT IT'S JUST TO SAY THAT I APPRECIATE WHERE THE CONCERN IS COMING FROM BUT THAT WAS NOT THE INTENT. AND AND AND CITY. IT THE BILL DOES NOT PRESCRIBE. WHAT TO DO -- EIGHT EIGHT ALLOW CD TO TAKE PRIVATE FUNDING IT'S PERMISSIVE YEAH. ASSEMBLYMEMBER THANK YOU -- I THINK EVERYBODY FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION AND I KNOW THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES -- DO WE HAVE A MOTION. THANKYOU A SEVEN MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I RESPECTFULLY AFTER THAT CONVERSATION I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE I I THINK.

MY PRIMARY ROLE OUT WE'VE IS TO EDUCATE AND ADVOCATE FOR STUDENTS ALL THE WAY FROM KINDERGARTEN UP TO SENIOR YEAR. OF COLLEGE -- I HAVE SEEN A NUMBER OF TIMES UNFORTUNATELY STUDENTS WHO DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RESOURCES ARE UNTIL I STEP FOOT ON THEIR CAMPUS. AND EDUCATE THEM AND TELL THEM HEY THESE ARE YOUR OPTIONS WITH THE LITTLE NUMBER ON THE BACK OF THEIR ID CARD THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT READILY AVAILABLE NOT ONLY FOR THEMSELVES.

THANK YOU ADDITIONAL SUPPORT SEEING AND HEARING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. COME ON UP. WE HAVE THE SUPPORT JUST MOVE OVER ONE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. JEFF PERFECT BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. YOUR MANAGER OF RED BUTTONS SORRY ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS RAY FOR NOW I'M THE DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION FOR THE CALIFORNIA CATHOLIC CONFERENCE. AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO A. B.. SIX TWO FOUR OUR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IS VERY SPECIFIC. THE INCLUSION OF ANYMORE HOTLINE NUMBERS REGARDLESS HOW WERE THEY WILL DIMINISH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE ONLY NUMBER. THAT IS NOW REQUIRED ENSUED IDENTIFICATION CARDS FROM SEVENTH GRADE THROUGH COLLEGE WHICH IS THIS IS THIS WHO IS THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE. NOT EVERY IMPORTANT ASSISTANCE NUMBER CAN FIT ON STOOD NINETIES. WITH EACH ADDITIONAL NUMBER REQUIRED AND STUDENT ID'S ALL BECOME SMALLER. AT SOME POINT USELESS. THEREFORE THE FOCUS SHOULD REMAIN ON PREVENTING YOUTH SUICIDE. SUICIDE AMONG OUR TEENS AND COLLEGE STUDENTS IS AN UNPARALLELED NATIONAL CRISIS. SUICIDE RATES AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE ALMOST DOUBLED IN SEVENTEEN YEARS. SUICIDE IS NOW THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR THOSE AGES. TEN TO FOURTEEN NEARLY ONE IN FIVE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED ATTEMPTING SUICIDE. MORE TIMES. ONE IN TWELVE COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE MADE A SUICIDE PLAN. EVERY LIFE IS PRECIOUS TO MUST BE PROTECTED. ESPECIALLY WHEN MOST WEAK AND VULNERABLE. HAVING ONLY THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE ON ID'S HELPS PREVENT IMMINENT EATH AMONG OUR YOUTH WHO ARE AT RISK OF KILLING THEMSELVES. THAT'S WHY THE SINGLE NUMBER WAS PLACED ON STUDENT ID'S WITH UNANIMOUS APPROVAL OF THE LEGISLATURE AND WITH UNIVERSAL SUPPORT AMONG CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOL COMMUNITIES. THIS ONE NUMBER. GIVE STUDENTS CONTEMPLATING SUICIDE AND OTHER STUDENTS WHO KNOW CLASSMATES THAT MAY BE DOING SO. A DEDICATED RESOURCE TO IMMEDIATELY ACCESS FOR CRITICAL SUPPORT IN MOMENTS OF CRISIS. AB SIX TWO FOUR WOULD DETRACT FROM THIS VITAL LIFESAVING RESOURCE. UNDER THIS BILL TWO OR THREE ADDITIONAL NUMBERS WOULD BE MANDATED TO BE PLACED ON STUDENT ID'S. ALTHOUGH THIS MEASURE HAS THE BEST INTENTIONS. IT WOULD UNDERMINE OUR STATE'S COMMITMENT TO PREVENT YOUTH SUICIDE. AND WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. YOUR MEMBERS MY OWN. IF. YOU'RE MEMBERS A THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPPOSE -- AB SIX TWENTY FOUR MY NAME IS -- GREG BIRDS WITH THE CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL. WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR CHANGING THIS BILL FROM WHEN IT WAS FIRST INTRODUCED. BUT WE STILL HAVE SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THIS PROPOSAL. FIRST ORGANIZATION A JET OF CHECKS TO THE AUTHOR GIVING A PRIVATE ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORTS HIS CAMPAIGN PLANNED PARENTHOOD. THE BILL OF THE TO USE THIS LAW TO PROMOTE ITSELF TO MILLIONS OF PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS AND COLLEGE STUDENTS. YOU HAVE TO ADMIT THIS BILL WILL GIVE A LOT OF FREE ADVERTISING TO ORGANIZATIONS LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD. THAT IS GOING TO MAKE OTHER PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS JEALOUS I CAN IMAGINE IN THE COMING YEARS MANY PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS GIVING MONEY TO POLITICIANS. IN HOPES THAT THEIR PRODUCT HOT LINES GET MANDATED IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS. THIS IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE USE OF GOVERNMENT RESOURCES WE ALSO BELIEVE THIS BILL VIOLATES THE FREE SPEECH RIGHTS OF PRO LIFE STUDENTS WITHIN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. BY FORCING THEM TO DISPLAY AROUND THEIR NECKS OR HOLD IN THEIR POCKETS AND ID CARD THAT ADVERTISES FOR ABORTION SERVICES. IN CONTRADICTION TO THEIR SINCERELY HELD BELIEFS. AND LASTLY THIS BILL STILL COMPELS PRIVATE SCHOOLS TO COMMUNICATE A GOVERNMENT SPONSORED MESSAGE BY REQUIRING THEM TO PRINT THE NUMBERS OF PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS ON STUDENT NINETIES. THE SUPREME COURT RECENTLY INVALIDATED THE CALIFORNIA FACT ACT FOR THE SAME TYPE OF GOVERNMENT COMPELLED SPEECH CALLING IT A VIOLATION OF FIRST AMENDMENT. AND THIS BILL IS NO DIFFERENT. I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE AUTHOR REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT THAT RELIGIOUS PRIVATE SCHOOLS -- DON'T HAVE TO PRINT THE SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH HOTLINE ON ID CARDS HE RECOGNIZED A COMPELLING A RELIGIOUS SCHOOL TO PROMOTE A MESSAGE IT DISAGREES WITH. VIOLATES THE CONSTITUTION. BUT ALL THE GOVERNMENT COMPELLED SPEECH VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT. IT DOES NOT MATTER IF THE SPEECH BEING COMPELLED AGREED YOU CAN WRAP IT UP YOUR TIME'S UP. A AGREES OR CONFLICTS WITH THE PRIVATE MESSAGE OF THE VALUES OF THE ORGANIZATION PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS ARE PRIVATE FOR A REASON. THE CONTENT THEY GIVE TO THEIR STUDENTS REGARDING MORAL ISSUES A BEHAVIOR COME FROM THEM ALONE AND THE STATE SHOULD NOT BE MANDATING THESE MESSAGES ON PRIVATE SCHOOLS OR ANY OTHER PRIVATE ORGANIZATION AND FOR THESE RINK YOU. WE OPPOSE THANK YOU FOR BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT BUT I FIND IT SOMEWHAT -- OFFENSIVE THAT THE OPPOSITION DOESN'T THINK THAT BEING RAPED IS LIFE ALTERING AND I KNOW THAT WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE COMMIT SUICIDE BECAUSE IT DOES IN YOUR LIFE BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT A PIECE OF YOU AND A PIECE OF YOUR SOUL DIES.

BUFFY TESTING GROUNDS JANUARY -- NINETEEN NINETY SIX WHEN YOU ENTERED INSTITUTIONS THEY DO -- TAKE TESTS TO SEE WHERE YOU EDUCATIONAL LEVEL IS AT TO SEE WHAT A PLACE YOU WANT TO GET EDUCATION OR WHAT THEY PUT YOU IN THE JOB PLACE. I CAME IN READING AT A FOURTH GRADE LEVEL. I SET THERE. I DON'T KNOW MAYBE TWO YEARS BEFORE I DECIDED TO PICK UP A BOOK.

I REALIZE AND UNDERSTOOD THE EDUCATION WAS MY KEY TO BE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL -- HERE IN SOCIETY TO BECOME PART OF THE THINGS THAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING. AND SO WHEN I CAME HOME I CONTINUE THAT EDUCATION. AND IT COST ME TO GO TO COLLEGE WHO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOT DID. I'M NOT DIG GOING OUT TO POLITICAL SCIENCE.

PUSHES THAT OVER TO THE END OF THOSE IS PART OF MY COMMUNITY. WE ARE DEPRIVE COMMUNITY WE ARE COMMITTED SKILLED. FEB VERY SO ON THAT. NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE KNOW. AND SO WHEN WE HEAR THE PEOPLE HERE EXONERATING THE OFTEN ACTS WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. AND I HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO THE HAS BEEN SEVENTEEN YEARS IN PRISON FOR SOMETHING NOT AND DO NOT WAS AND IS A I THOUGHT I RESPECTFULLY EX THAT YOU PASSED HIS VOTE. NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF BECAUSE I WOULD DEFINITELY LOVE TO BE ABLE TO BE ACCEPTED INTO A UC. TO GO TO SCHOOL.

THANK YOU SIR LET ME JUST SAY THAT WE WILL LEARN MORE FROM YOU THAN YOU WILL LEARN FROM US AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TO TESTIFY YOU HELP MAKE US BETTER LEGISLATORS. THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TERMS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE STATE WHAT ASSOCIATION CALLED OFFENSE ATTORNEYS -- I THINK AFTER HEARING OP LET LET ME JUST CHANGE MY COMMENTS JUST JUST A BIT -- THIS BILLS REAL REALLY BYPRODUCT OF WORK THAT OBESE PUT IN. SINCE USER HE WAS RELEASED FROM PRISON ON MY FIRST MEADOW BE. ABOUT FOUR FIVE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS WORKING ON A BILL -- TO TRY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS AND DEAL WITH PASTORAL MISCONDUCT. AND OB VOLUNTEERS TIME TO COME UP AND MEET LEGISLATORS TO TELL HIS STORY HOW BOTH DA'S AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WITHHELD EVIDENCE OF HIS INNOCENCE. AND IT TOOK SEVENTEEN YEARS FOR HIM TO GET OUT OF PRISON HE WAS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN PRISON. PLUS FIFTY YEARS THE FACT THAT HE ACTUALLY TOOK EDUCATION K. CLASSES IN PRISON SAID SOMETHING ABOUT OP -- ABOUT THAT TIME LIMIT LET ME JUST SAY THIS AT THAT TIME. AND I'VE WORKING CRIMINAL DEFENSE WORK FOR NOT ONLY THE LOBBYIST HOUSES IN ATTORNEY FOR YEARS. ANY BROUGHT SOMETHING UP TO ADD IN REAL LIFE AND THAT IS EXONERATED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHEN THEY ARE RELEASED FROM PRISON RECEIVE NOTHING? WHEN YOU COMMIT A CRIME IN YOUR OWN POORLY RECEIVED GET MONEY YOU GET A PAROLE OFFICER GET PAROLE SERVICES HOUSING MENTAL HEALTH? JOB TRAINING. ALL THESE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE THE OPTION COMMITTED THE CRIME FOR EXONERATE. UP TO FOUR YEARS AGO THERE IS NOTHING PROVIDED -- OUT OF THE GATE YOU CAN FILE FOR CLAIMING COMPENSATION TAKES ABOUT FIVE SIX SEVEN YEARS DIESEL IS OPPOSE IT. SUCKED OUT POINT WE MADE A COMMITMENT TO WORK TOGETHER TO START ADDRESSING THAT TO CHANGE THE PRACTICES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE FIRST BILL THAT PASSED. GRACIOUSLY ON THE LEGISLATURE CALLED OBESE LAW. AND MADE BECAUSE HONOREES ELIGIBLE FOR THE SAME SERVICES PAROLEES. HE CAN HE STARTED ORGANIZATION CONVENE EXONERATES AROUND THE COUNTRY SAT DOWN WITH THEM FACE TO FACE AND SAID WHAT WOULD WE NEED MENTAL HEALTH. JOB TRAINING EDUCATION WE LOOK TO WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING TEXAS IS THE ONLY STATE RIGHT NOW THAT PROVIDES EDUCATION FREE OF CHARGE. FOR EXONERATION WE SAID THIS IS WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN CALIFORNIA. THE LAST THING I'LL ADD IS THAT -- BUT FOR HIS WORK BUT FOR HIM BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION. THE CITY CALIFORNIA WOULD BE TWENTY THOUSAND STEPS BEHIND INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW TEN THOUSAND STEPS BEHIND. AND THE ONE THING THAT HE REMINDED US IS THAT SINCE THE SEVENTEEN YEARS HE SPENT IN PRISON AND THEN SAVE THE ON JOHNSON AND SOME OF THE OTHER FOLKS THAT WE MEET WITH. THOSE ARE YEARS THAT THEY'RE NOT IN SCHOOL THEY'RE NOT LEARNING THE JOB SKILLS THEY'RE NOT DOING ALL OF THIS IT'S A WAY TO CATCH UP AND SO THIS BILL WAS REALLY -- AN OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE. PART OF THAT PATHWAY AND TO MAKE UP. TO SOME EXTENT MAKE UP FOR THE CITY CALIFORNIA TAKEN AWAY ALL THE YEARS OF THE OF THEIR LIFE SO. I'VE SAID THIS JOKINGLY BUT I ACTUALLY MEAN THIS I WILL HELP THROW PARADE FOR THE FIRST EXONERATED GET INTO THE UC. UNDER THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IS A TESTAMENT TO JUST THERE THERE'S THE HUMAN SPIRIT AND I CAN'T REALLY MAKE UP FOR WHAT WE'VE TAKEN AWAY BUT WE CAN DO ABOUT SO. FOR THOSE REASONS I ASKED FOR A SUPPORT THE BILL. THANK YOU YOUR IT WE CAN'T MAKE UP BUT WHEN YOU THROW THAT PARADE YOU LET US KNOW SO THAT WE CAN BE THEIR TAIL. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SEEING HEARING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU AND I AS A MEMBER OF OUR THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TESTIFYING -- AND AND IS THAT THE CASE WAS SAID -- YOU KNOW A GRAVE INJUSTICE WAS UNDER NO WAY WE CAN MAKE IT UP BUT WE CAN TRY TO DO SOMETHING MOVING FORWARD AND CERTAINLY I THINK THIS IS MORE THAN APPROPRIATE -- TO BE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE THAT OPPORTUNITY TAKING THOSE YEARS OF LIFE AWAY FROM YOU AND OTHERS ON THE RES -- WE NEED TO TRY TO GIVE YOU OPPORTUNITIES WHEN YOU COME OUT AND SO I'M VERY HAPPY THIS NICE SUPPORT BILL WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THE BUILT APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN CENTER DRUG SO. I I TO WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THERE'S NOTHING MORE POWERFUL. SECOND -- ONLY TO DOCTOR WEBER IS THE WAY SHE TESTIFIES. AND I MUST SAY THAT'S A VERY VERY HIGH BAR AND YOUR YOUR ABOVE THAT. SO -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE CENTER DORADO ASSEMBLY WOMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I WANT TO I WANT TO THANK -- BE IN ANTHONY FOR WORK FOR COMING TODAY -- YOU KNOW I I HE WAS WITH ME THE OTHER DAY BECAUSE THERE'S A SECOND BILL THAT WE'RE DOING. ALL THE ALSO DEALS WITH HOUSING FOR EXONERATING IN -- AND IT'S NOT A LOT OF THEM BUT THE IMPACT OF THAT OF THAT INCARCERATIONS HAD ON THEIR LIVES IS JUST AN UNBELIEVABLE. I DON'T THINK ANY OF US CAN IMAGINE IT'S HORRIBLE TO IMAGINE BEING INCARCERATED. IT'S EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE BEING INCARCERATED FOR SOMETHING YOU DID NOT DO. AND THEN TO BE LET FREE TO COME OUT OF AND THEN AND BE GIVEN NOTHING. IN RETURN TO BE BROUGHT OUT BECAUSE MANY OF THEM HAVE LOST THEIR FAMILIES AND ON ALL THOSE YEARS. THEIR SPOUSES HAVE DIVORCED -- THEIR FAMILIES HAVE MOVED AWAY THEIR PARENTS HAVE DIED YOU KNOW THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN A FIFTEEN TO TWENTY YEAR PERIOD WELL YOU INCARCERATED SO YOU COME OUT WITHOUT A LOT OF SUPPORT AND AS A STATE WE DON'T EVEN SAY I'M SORRY. I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU SEEN THE MOVIE A WHEN THEY SEE US IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT YOU MUST SEE IT IT'S ON NETFLIX. IT'S ABOUT THE YOUNG MAN IN NEW YORK COOL WRONGFULLY CONVICTED AND SO I ASKED MISTER ANTHONY THE OTHER DAY. WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO HIT THE THE THE WHO HID EVIDENCE FROM YOU WHAT ABOUT THE JUDGE YOU DIDN'T CONSIDER CERTAIN THINGS WHAT ABOUT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND WITH THE WHOLE IS? WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO INTENTIONALLY HELD INFORMATION EVERY LAST ONE OF HAS BEEN PROMOTED UP THE LINE? THE JUDGES NOW AIDED DEALING WITH THE HE'S ON THE COURT OF APPEALS -- THAT SOMEBODY ELSE IS NOT CHARGE OF ALL INVESTIGATION SO NOTHING NEGATIVE IS HAPPEN TO THOSE FOLKS WHO INTENTIONALLY INTENTIONALLY KEPT INFORMATION WAY. AND SO WHEN YOU SEE THESE THINGS IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO THE TO MATCH AND OUR SYSTEM DOES THIS AND THEN WE DON'T DO ANYTHING IN RETURN. IT TAKES YEARS FOR THEM TO GET ANY KIND OF COMPENSATION -- TO BASICALLY REBUILD THEIR LIVES AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THAT AND SO -- MANY OF THEM LIVE WITH THEIR ATTORNEYS HE'S BEEN ABLE TO SHARE WITH US HIS STORY -- ON A VERY PERSONAL LEVEL AND AND SO I JUST REALLY THINK THAT IT THIS TIME WE'VE GOT TWO BILLS THAT STILL ALIVE THE THIRD ONE DEALT WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND WILL WILL COVER THAT AND ANOTHER THING BUT WE GET TWO BILLS. THAT IS STILL A LOT OF THIS IS CALIFORNIA IS SORRY. WE'RE SORRY FOR WHAT TOOK PLACE AND W WANT TO HELP YOU REBUILD YOUR LIFE AND THAT'S WHY I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI.

THIRTEEN OH SEVEN PROCEED WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING MY MENTOR AND MEMBERS -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENTTODAY FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CONFLICT LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS WITH SB SEVENTY SEVEN THE EDUCATION BUDGET TRAILER BILL AND LET THE COMMITTEE KNOW THAT I WILL WORK WITH LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL TO ENSURE THE CONFLICT IS RESOLVED. SHOULD THIS BILL MOVED FORWARD TODAY. I BELIEVE THAT IT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE EVERY STUDENT HAS ACCESS TO FUNDING FOR COLLEGE AND COST SHOULD NEVER BE THE FINAL DETERMINATION WHEN CHOOSING A COLLEGE TO ATTEND. THAT IS WHY I AM VERY EXCITED TO AUTHOR ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN OH SEVEN THE COLLEGE OPPORTUNITY ACT. THIS BILL WILL BRING STABILITY TO THE CAL GRANT AWARD BY IMPLEMENTING A NEW WORD FUNDING FORMULA FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING PRIVATE NONPROFIT UNIVERSITIES. I LIKE THE AWARDS FOR UC AND CSU THERE ARE JUST THE BASED ON CHANGES IN TUITION THE AWARD ALLOCATION FOR PRIVATE NONPROFIT UNIVERSITIES WHAT SET TO A STATIC AMOUNT IN THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND UPON SUCCESS OF AB. THIRTEEN OH SEVEN CAL GRANT AWARDS FOR PRIVATE NONPROFIT COLLEGES WILL INCREASE AND IT JUST WITH FUTURE INCREASES IN ALLOCATIONS FOR THE CSU. CAL GRANT AWARDS PROVIDE CRITICAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO STUDENTS AND CAN OFTEN BE THE FINAL DETERMINATION ON SCHOOL ACCESS. NOT ONLY DOES THE CAL GRANT PROVIDING AFFORDABLE PATHWAY TO COLLEGE IT SERVES A SIGNIFICANT POPULATION OF UNDERSERVED SERVE STUDENTS. IN FACT 48% OF CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS ARE LATINO WHICH IS ONE REASON THIS BILL IS A TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN A LATINO CAUCUS PRIORITY. NOW MORE THAN EVER IT IS CRUCIAL THAT WE INCREASE ACCESS TO COLLEGE FOR ALL CALL CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. SO THAT STUDENTS FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES DO NOT DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY CAN AFFORD COLLEGE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE TIME TO PRESENT AND TODAY WITH ME. I HAVE -- EIGHT A STUDENT FROM UNIVERSITY OF REDLANDS STUDENTS ADDRESS ARRIVE TODAY AND ALEX GRAVES FROM THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT COLLEGE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITIES.

THIS APRIL I EARNED A BACHELORS OF ARTS AND COMMUNICATED DECIRTE DISORDERS AND I AND STRATEGY I'M. AND I HOPE TO CONTINUE MY STUDIES STERN EDUCATIONAL GRADUATE SCHOOL PROGRAM IN LEARNING AND TECHNOLOGY. ULTIMATELY I ASPIRE TO BECOME THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE SAM REGINA CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. I LIKE IT. ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND CAL GRANT STUDENTS ATTENDING INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THE STATE. I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND OUR GRATITUDE FOR ALL THE SUPPORT THE STATE HAS PROVIDED US WITH THE CAL GRANT AWARD. WHILE WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THE SUPPORT WE STRONGLY BELIEVE FINANCIALLY REFORM MUST INCLUDE A RENEWED COMMITMENT TO CAL GRANT STUDENT ATTENDING NONPROFIT INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. THIS IS WHY TODAY WE ASK YOU TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN OH SEVEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLANCA RUBIO TO RE ESTABLISH A CAL GRANT FUNDING FORMULA FOR STUDENTS LIKE ME WHO CHOOSE TO ATTEND INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE UNIVERSITY OF REDLANDS -- AS A FORMER CAL GRANT RECIPIENT I CAN ATTEST THAT THE CAL GRANT WAS AN IMPORTANT INVESTMENT IN THE PURSUIT OF AN EDUCATION. GROWING UP I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO PURSUE MY POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AT A PRIVATE INSTITUTION. I DECIDED TO SMALLER CLASS SIZES AN INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION BASS CAMPUS RESOURCES AND WELCOMING COMMUNITY. THE UNIVERSITY OF REDLANDS HAD EVERYTHING THEY DESIRED AND MUCH MORE. UNFORTUNATELY THE SCHOOL HADA SEEMINGLY EXPENSIVE PRICE SECOND HAD ME QUESTIONING IF I CAN AFFORD IT. THANKS TO THE CAL GRANT MY FAMILY AND I COULD AFFORD SUCH A PROCEDURE EDUCATION WITHOUT HAVING TO WORK EXCESSIVE HOURS IN WITHOUT HAVING TO POSTPONE MY EDUCATION YOUTH TO FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. I AM FOREVER THANKFUL TO THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM AS AS PROVIDED ME WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP MY PROFESSIONAL SKILLS IT ALLOWED ME TO GRADUATE A YEAR EARLY. AND HAS HELPED ME BECOME WORK FORCE READY. INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE PLACES OF INNOVATION INSPIRATION AND ARE PIONEERS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM TO GO. ABOVE AND BEYOND TRADITIONAL BOUNDARIES. THESE INSTITUTIONS PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROVIDE ONE ON ONE ATTENTION FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND GUARANTEED ON CAMPUS HOUSING FOR ALL FOUR YEARS. IN CONCLUSION ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN OH SEVEN IS A BILL THAT IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE NONPROFIT INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY STUDENTS LIKE ME WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE HIGHER EDUCATION THIS FINANCIALLY. EQUITABLE PREDICTABLE AND STABLE AS A FUTURE EDUCATOR I WANT TO ENSURE THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS OF STUDENTS LIKE MYSELF -- BELIEVE THAT SCHOOLS LIKE RESIDENTS ARE ACCESSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE PATHWAYS FOR THEM IN THEIR PURSUIT OF HIGHER EDUCATION THANK YOU.

WE LOOK YOU KNOW SCHOOLS ARE LOOKED AT AS A CENTER IN CASE% THERE'S A DISASTER BUT ON A POSITIVE NOTE THERE ALSO THERE FOR THE THE SPORTS AND THE YOUTH -- THE SPECIAL PROGRAMS -- AND EVEN SOME OF THE SPECIAL EVENTS THAT ARE OCCURRING IN THE COMMUNITY. AS THE ANALYSIS -- CORRECTLY INDICATES THE CIVIC CENTER ACT DOES REQUIRE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO MAINTAIN THE FACILITIES AND CLEAN SAFE CONDITION. AND SUBJECT SCHOOL DISTRICTSTO LIABILITY FOR ANY INJURY FOR FAILURE. TO MAINTAIN THOSE FACILITIES ARE GROUNDS WITH BUDGET STRESSES AND CONSTRAINTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS STILL COULD INCUR OVER ALL THESE YEARS MAINTENANCE OPERATION BUDGETS HAVE NOT YET FULLY RECOVERED. AND BUILDING GROUNDS CONTINUE TO FALL SHORT OF THE NECESSARY MAINTENANCE WHEN YOU ADD IN AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER INDICATED THE ADDITIONAL TIME IN THE WEAR AND TEAR CREATED BY ALL THE YOUTH SPORTS IN THE COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES. THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO MAINTAIN THOSE FACILITIES AND TO AVOID THE POTENTIAL LIABILITY. WE THINK THIS BILL IS A REASONABLE APPROACH YEAH IT HERE'S TO THE INTENT AND PURPOSE OF THE CIVIC CENTER ACT FOR THAT REASON WE SUPPORT. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS OR PRESIDENT ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS I THINK MY COLLEAGUE -- REALLY COVER THE BILL I EXTENSIVELY THE ONLY THING I WOULD LIKE TO ADD IS THAT OUR MEMBERS ARE TELLING US THAT. THEY'RE GETTING MORE MORE REQUEST TO USE OUR FACILITIES AND SO THE DEMAND IS EVEN INCREASING THAT THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO HELP MAINTAIN THE SITES. VERY GOOD.
