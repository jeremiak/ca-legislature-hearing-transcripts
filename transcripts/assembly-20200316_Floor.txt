FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO GIVE THE GOVERNOR BROUGHT A FORTY TO DEAL WITH THIS PANDEMIC IN OUR STATE. CIVIC LEAVE THIS APPROPRIATION MENTIONS GIVEN THE GOVERNOR THE ABILITY TO INCREASE HOSPITAL CAPACITY INCREASE BED CAPACITY FOR HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AROUND OUR STATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE HOTELS AND MOTELS TO GET PEOPLE OUR STREETS AND THEN LASTLY INSURING THERE'S MONEY FOR EXTRA CLEANING CHILD CARE. OF OUR STATE. THE APPROPRIATIONS FOR FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SPLIT UP TO A BILLION DOLLARS ONCE JAIL BC THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE HAS BEEN NOTIFIED WE THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE GOVERNOR THE TOOL. TO FIGHT THIS PANDEMIC IN OUR STATE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE ARE WORKING ON THIS DISASTER IF. THERE ARE ANY. LOSING THEIR JOBS GETTING THEIR HOURS CUT LOSING THEIR ABILITY TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE PAY RENT WE ALSO KNOW THERE MANY SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE ON THE BRINK. OF CLOSE. SO WE PUT IT IN LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE EVERY INTENT TO. DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE- WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A FEDERAL STIMULUS PACKAGE THAT WAS PASSED WITH A TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT STIMULUS REALLY MEANS FOR OUR STATE HEARING CALIFORNIA. BUT ALSO SPENT TIME TO FIGURE OUT HOW US. COULD ASSIST ALL OUR CONSTITUENTS UP A DOWN THE STATE. THANK YOU FOR STAYING MISTER OBERNOLTE. MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHTY NINE THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THE GOVERNOR TO APPROPRIATE UP TO ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND MONEY TO DEAL WITH. AND PRESS OF OUR- THE SHORT CUTS THE USUAL CREATION OF BUDGETARY PROCESSES HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND INSTEAD ONLY REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO NOTIFY THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. SEVENTY TWO OUT OF SPENDING THOSE FUNDS. BY TAKING THIS ACTION WE ARE PLACING AN EXTRAORDINARY DEGREE OF TRUST IN GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM HOWEVER THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARY TIMES AND IT MAKES SENSE TO CONCENTRATE DECISION. AUTHORITY THE PLACE WERE THE- THE SECOND BEST EXPEDITE GETTING THESE FUNDS TO THE VIAL USES IT'LL PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THIS ILLNESS. THESE FUNDS ARE CRITICAL TO MAKING SURE THAT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS BUILT UP TO DEAL WITH HIS EMERGENCY TO MITIGATING DAMAGE TO BURKE BUT BOY IMPACT WAY. SURE THAT MY CALIFORNIANS ARE STUPID IRISH AND I. THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE MISTER KILEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT TODAY AT A MOMENT WITHOUT PRECEDENT IN ANY OF OUR EXPERIENCE FOR NEARLY FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS THREE AND THIRTY MILLION AMERICANS AND PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD. THIS IS THE REAL TIME A SHARP AND BREAK FROM ALL NORMALCY IT'S A MOMENT OF CRISIS IN EVERY SENSE OCIAL PARALYSIS. I'M A BALL AND MORTAL PAIR. IT'S A MOMENT WHERE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CITIZENS AND GOVERNMENT HAS BECOME A RADICALLY DIFFERENT. THE MOST TRIFLING IS A PERSONAL CONCERN WHERE TO EAT LUNCH WHO TO VISIT HOW TO SPEND THE WEEKEND ARE NOW WITHIN THE AMBIT OF STATE POLICY AND ULTIMATELY STATE POWER. FOR THAT REASON. RELATIONSHIP OF TRUST OPENNESS DIALOGUE AND ACCESSIBILITY BETWEEN CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES. HAS NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT. TODAY I'M SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE SB EIGHTY NINE AND I'M SUPPORTING OUR GOVERNOR. I STAND READY TO ASSIST GOVERNOR NEWSOME AND OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES ANYWAY I CAN I CALL IN EVERY LEGISLATOR AND CAL. ARE LESS OF POLITICAL PRINCE TO TRUST IN GOVERNOR NEWSOME SHIP AND LISTEN TO HIS GUIDANCE TO UNDERSTAND THAT HARSH DISRUPTIVE PREVIOUSLY UNTHINKABLE RESTRICTION. MATTER NOT A CHOICE BUT A NECESSITY. WE SHOULD ALL OFFER OUR OWN IDEAS EVEN CRITICISM WHERE APPROPRIATE BUT ONLY AS PART OF A COLLABORATIVE SEARCH FOR SOLUTIONS THE PARTISAN RITUALS OF ORDINARY POLITICS HAVE NO PLACE IN THESE EXTRAORDINARY TIMES. WE SHOULD ALSO ASK. IN THE MIDST OF SWEEPING EXECUTIVE ACTION. WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY EVEN IF WE'RE AWAY FROM THE CAPITAL. BEYOND THE NOT BOLTS OF APPROPRIATING AND AUTHORIZING AS WE'RE DOING NOW. WE CAN OFFER SOMETHING MORE. PERSPECTIVE INSIDE AND FEEDBACK. AS THE GOVERNOR IS IMMERSED IN THE URGENT AND ALL CONSUMING TASKS OF CONFRONTING DEREK. WE CAN TAKE A SOMEWHAT BROADER VIEW. THIS INCLUDES ANTICIPATING THE SECONDARY AND TERTIARY PROBLEMS THAT WILL INEVITABLY ARISE FROM FAR REACHING INTERVENTION SOME OF WHICH WERE MENTIONED BY THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM SAN FRANCISCO. PLEASE PUT OUR IMMEDIATE AND URGENT KIDS WHO ARE OUT OF SCHOOL AND MISSING MEALS. OTHERS ARE JUST AS CLEAR BUT CUMULATIVE A LOSS OF LEARNING TIME FOR STUDENTS OF INCOME FOR WORKERS AND BUSINESSES OF SERVICES FROM COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. OTHER CORROSIVE EFFECTS ARE MORE SUBTLE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TOLL OF ISOLATION THE DEPLETION OF SOCIAL CAPITAL THE STRAIN FABRIC OF COMMUNITIES RIVEN BY FEAR THESE ARE UNFAMILIAR VEXING MONUMENTAL CHALLENGES THEY CRIED OUT FOR LEGISLATIVE ATTENTION AND WISDOM. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE WORKING WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS IS CONSUMER. WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER AND THE WAY WILL MEET THESE CHALLENGES IS TOGETHER WITH INGENUITY AND RESOURCEFULNESS WITH GOOD WILL AND COMPASSION WITH STRENGTH AND SOLIDARITY. SOCIAL DISTANCE NEED NOT MEAN SOCIETAL DISSONANCE OR SPIRITUAL DISCORD. IN A WAY THE VERY INTER CONNECTEDNESS THAT MADE THIS VIRUS SO QUICK TO SPREAD ALSO GIVES US THE CAPACITY. TO DEFEAT IT. AND WE HAVE ANOTHER ADVANTAGE I CAN DO SENSE OF POSSIBILITY THAT IS DISTINCTLY CALIFORNIA. AN UNMATCHED ABILITY TO TAKE OUR CIRCUMSTANCES AND MAKE THE BEST OF THEM. THAT'S WHAT WE MUST NOW MORE THAN EVER WHETHER WE CAN A RISE TO THE OCCASION IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD WILL DETERMINE THE FATE OF UNTOLD LIVES AND WILL SHAPE WHAT OUR STATE LOOKS LIKE ON THE UPPER SIDE.
