AMENDMENTS FOR SUGGESTED WE SEE PROVIDED OFFICE BUT APARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES. ABI HOPE TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THE BILL COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN STATE DOLLARS HELD ACCOUNTABLE. AB NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE THE CALIFORNIA DEFORESTATION FREE PROCUREMENT ACT WOULD REQUIRE ANY ENTITIES CONTRACT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CERTIFY THEY'RE NOT CONTRIBUTING TO TROPICAL DEFORESTATION EITHER DIRECTLY. OR THROUGH THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS. THE DESTRUCTION AND DEGRADATION OF TROPICAL FORESTS DUE TO INDUSTRIAL SCALE EXPLOITATION ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS CONTRIBUTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE. ADDITIONALLY THEY HAVE WIDE RANGING IMPACTS ON BIODIVERSITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO PROTECTING INDIGENOUS LED STEWARDSHIP AND GOVERNANCE OF THESE LANDS. AB NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE IS MODELED AFTER THE EXISTING SWEAT FREE CODE OF CONDUCT BUT SUCH SHOP FREE CODE OF CONDUCT FOR STATE CONTRACTS AND PROCUREMENT BAN AGAINST CHILD LABOR- AS THE FIFTH-LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD CALIFORNIA'S PURCHASING POWER HAS SIGNIFICANT MARKET FORCE THIS BILL BUILT WIELDS THAT FORCED TO EXTEND OUR STATE'S ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP GEN A TROPICAL FOREST. BY ADOPTING THE PROCUREMENT POLICY BEING SUE THAT THE STATE IS NOT AN INADVERTENT CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEGRADATION OF TROPICAL FORESTS AND SIGNAL TO GLOBAL MARKETS THE DESTRUCTIVE COMMODITY DRIVEN DEFORESTATION WILL NOT BE TOLERATED A. B. NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE ENJOYS BROAD SUPPORT FROM ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY EXPERTS WILDLIFE ADVOCATES A COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES INVESTORS THAT SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF THE BILL'S SPONSORS ARE NICK SACK IN ABOUT HALF OF SUCH COMPASSION LEGISLATION AND DAVID COMPOUNDED READING TESTIMONY ON BEHALF. OF FRIENDS OF THE EARTH. THE FIRST RIGHT. HI MISTER SECOND UP TO MIND OR DO YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD AND I WILL BEGIN WITH- MISTER CONTAINER GOOD MORNING CHAIRWOMAN CONGRATULATIONS. GOOD MORNING YOUR WOMAN DAVID CANTON I'M DAVID- ON BEHALF OF FRIENDS OF THE EARTH ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF AB NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. EVERY THREE DAYS THE WORLD LOSES AN AREA OF TROPICAL FOREST THE SIZE OF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WHAT DOES THE WORLD LOSE WE LOSE OUR TROPICAL FORESTS WE LOSE COUNTLESS SPECIES SAMATAR RHINOS OR NAY AND ARRANGE A TANG'S GREAT APES AND INNUMERABLE MIGRATORY BIRDS. WE LOSE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE CULTURES LANGUAGES AND LYFT WAYS AND WE LOSE OUR BAT LAST BEST CHANCE TO PRESENT AND MITIGATE RUN AWAY CLIMATE CHAOS. BECAUSE A QUARTER OF GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS RESULT FROM DEFORESTATION AND DEGRADATIONOF INTACT PRIMARY FOREST. IN GLASGOW LAST YEAR THE US JOINED OVER ONE HUNDRED COUNTRIES IN A PLEDGE TO HALT AND REVERSE GLOBAL DEFORESTATION BY TWENTY THIRTY. ON EARTH THEY JUST LAST WEEK PRESIDENT BIDEN ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO RE DOUBLE THAT COMMITMENT. AND SPECIFICALLY TO TAKE ACTION TO ADDRESS COMMODITY DRIVEN DEFORESTATION IN TANDEM WITH DEVELOPING NATIONS. AT THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN YOU WENT CLIMATE SUMMIT GOVERNMENTS AND INDUSTRY CAME TOGETHER. AND SIGNED AT NEW YORK DECLARATION ON FOREST THIS IS A COMMITMENT TO REDUCE GLOBAL DEFORESTATION BY HALF BY TWENTY TWENTY. AND ENDED BY TWENTY THIRTY CALIFORNIA WAS A SIGNATORY TO THIS DECLARATION. WHEN THE U. N. ACEST PROGRESS IN TWENTY TWENTY WHAT DID IT FIND NOT ONLY HAD THE WORLD MISS THE TWENTY TWENTY TARGET BUT GLOBAL DEFORESTATION IT ACTUALLY INCREASED BY OVER BECAUSE THERE'S NO ECONOMIC A REGULATORY INCENTIVE TO STOP IT. THIS MEASURE WILL AND INITIATE A GROUNDBREAKING APPROACH TO USING THE POWER OF THE PUBLIC PURSE TO REVERSE ONE OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE OF HUMAN AND CORPORATE ACTIVITIES. A STUDY BY FRIENDS OF THE EARTH REVEALS THAT ROUGHLY ONE QUARTER OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC PURCHASING MAY BE LINKED TO TROPICAL DEFORESTATION. THAT'S SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN STATE PROCUREMENT THAT COULD BE LEVERAGED TO SAVE THE WORLD'S FORESTS. BUT INSTEAD OF PAYING FOR THEIR DESTRUCTION. TO THE INDUSTRY OPPOSITION WE SAY THIS BILL DOES NOT ACTUALLY BANNED ANYTHING. THIS BILL MERELY LEGISLATIVE PROCUREMENT PREFERENCE FOR GOODS THAT DO NO HARM. BY MAKING THIS PROCUREMENT PREFERENCE CALIFORNIA SENT A VERY CLEAR MARKET SIGNAL TO THE MARKETS. THAT'S WHY EVERY ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATION IN THE COUNTRY WANT TO SEE THIS BILL BECOME LAW. NOT ONLY THAT THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITIES BEHIND THIS BILL LAST YEAR COALITION OF RESPONSIBLE INVESTORS. WHO COLLECTIVELY MANAGE ONE POINT FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS IN ASSETS SUPPORTED THE CASE THAT AB NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE IS GOOD FOR BUSINESS. THANK YOU AND WE ASK FOR YOUR I. YEAH. MR SACK HELLO CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS NICHOLAS SOCKET DIRECTOR AT SOCIAL COMPASSION IN LEGISLATION PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL- I BELIEVE THAT THE AUTHOR STATEMENT AND THE STATEMENT BY. FRIENDS OF THE EARTH SAID MOST OF WHAT NEEDS TO BE SAID I JUST WANT TO ADD. THE CALIFORNIANS OF ALL PARTY SUPPORT- THIS ACTION A TWENTY TWENTY ONE POLL CONDUCTED BY TOP POLLSTER. DATA ORBITAL SHOWED THAT 84% OF REGISTERED VOTERS IN THE STATE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OUR STATE PROCUREMENT POLICIES CONTRIBUTING TO DEFORESTATION. THIS CONCERN TRANSLATE 281% SUPPORTING THE POLICY OF THE BILL. THAT PASSED THIS BILL SIMPLE. WILL DETERMINE WHETHER OUR STATE GOVERNMENT BUYS PRODUCTS FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING BEST BY OUR MOST IMPORTANT FOREST INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. AND ALL OF US WHO WANT A HABITABLE PLANET. OR WILL OUR STATE TURN A BLIND EYE. AND CONTINUE BUYING PRODUCTS PRODUCED BY COMPANIES DRIVING TROPICAL DEFORESTATION WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR HELP. THANK YOU I AND I BELIEVE WE DO HAVE- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I CA. WELL GO AHEAD AND HI HERE FROM ROBERT SPIEGEL WHO'S JOINING US FROM THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION- AND AUDREY READ JACK FROM CBI. MISTER SPEAKER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR GOOD MORNING MEMBERS IT'S- NICE TO BE BACK HERE AFTER A TWO YEAR HIATUS IS A COMMITTEE ROOM THAT I SERVED IN FOR ABOUT A DECADE PRIOR TO GOING TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR PRIVATE SECTOR EXCUSE ME SO IT'S GONNA BACK ROB SPIEGEL CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION OFF ON BEHALF OF A COALITION OF OTHER BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY SUPPOSED AB NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE WE DO UNDERSTAND RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS UNFORTUNATELY GIVEN THE SWEEPING IMPACTS OF THE LEGISLATION ON INDUSTRY AND BUSINESS- WE WILL NOT BE REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION TO THAT BILL. AND STILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH THE LANGUAGE MOVING FORWARD. THAT STATED OUR OPPOSITION WHAT OTHER MANY OUTSTANDING IF MANY OUTSTANDING ISSUES GIVEN THE BREADTH OF THE IMPACT OF THIS LEGISLATION A WHOLE LIST OF INDUSTRIES ARE A WHOLE HOST OF INDUSTRIES INCLUDING. THOSE ASSOCIATED PAPER AND BUILDING PRODUCTS SOLD ALSO- AUTOMOTIVE. AND FOOD ALL REALLY DO MY BEST TO KIND OF SUM UP. SOME OFTHOSE THREE KEY ISSUES. FIRST THE SCOPE OF AB NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE OF THE PRODUCTS THERE AND THE INDUSTRIES IN THAT IT MEANT BUSINESSES IMPACTED IS MASSIVE. THE DEFINITION OF A FORTRESS COMMODITY IS OVERLY BROAD MAKING IT SIGNIFICANTLY CHALLENGING FOR THE STATE TO PROCURE NEEDED INVENTORY. SECOND AB NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE IS NOT JUST LIMITED. TO TROPICAL DEFORESTATION. THE LEGISLATION OF DEATH- THE LEGISLATION'S DEFINITION OF TROPICAL FOREST. ALSO INCLUDES PEATLANDS AND PEATLANDS CONTAINS ITS OWN SEPARATE DEFINITION IN THE STATUTE- EXCUSE ME IN THE LEGISLATION. WHICH IS NOT EXISTING ANY TROPICAL ENVIRONMENT. OR EXCUSE ME THAT PEOPLE ENTER SEPARATELY TO FIND OUT COULD PERMAFROST TUNDRA. FOR THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION WE HAVE ASKED WHY IS A BILL WITH A STATED FOCUS ON TROPICAL DEFORESTATION. ENCOMPASSING FROZEN LANDS ASSOCIATED WITH TUNDRA WHICH DO NOT EXIST IN A TROPICAL ENVIRONMENT. UNTIL THE RECENT. AMENDMENTS OF AB NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. IT WAS IDENTICAL BEFORE ONE SIX THAT WAS VETOED BY GOVERNOR SOME LAST YEAR. NOW IN PART OF THE BILL'S IMPACT IN THE NATION PROVINCES OF CANADA WE BELIEVE THAT AB NINETEEN SEVEN DOT SEVENTY NINE RE INSTITUTE TO RECREATES THE SAME ISSUES FROM LAST YEAR. AND THIRDLY WELL WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THAT- ELIMINATOR DELETED THE REFERENCES TO THE FOURTH POLICY THAT WOULD BE CREATED BY BILL. THE LANGUAGE STILL HAS ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION TO G. G. S. AS TO WHICH FORCED ROOF COMMODITIES WILL ACTUALLY BE COVERED BY THE DGS DEFORESTATION FREE CODE OF CONDUCT. NOW AB NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE HAS THE ABILITY TO CREATE A DE FACTO BAN ON FOR FIRST PRODUCTS BECAUSE IT REQUIRES DGS TO IDENTIFY AND USE AT LEAST FOUR. FROM PALM OIL SOY BEEF WHETHER LUMBER. PAPER WOOD COFFEE AND WOOD PULP THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THAT ABOUT LISTING ABOUT BILL. NOW GIVEN THAT THE LIST CAN ONLY BE UPDATED ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS PRODUCTS LEFT OFF THAT LIST WOULD OTHERWISE NOT BE SUITABLE FOR CERTIFIED FOR PROCUREMENT PURPOSES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS WE APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSIONS WITH MEANT BY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND STAFF AND WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S ATTENTION WHATEVER WE DO RESPECTFULLY ASK. FOR NO VOTE ON THE BILL. THE MORNING CARE BETWEEN OR IS THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RGP PAYCHECK FROM CRUISE STRATEGIES REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. AND ALONG WITH ROBERT RUN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO AB NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. AM THE BILL EQUIRES A CONTRACTOR CONTRACTING WITH THE STATE AGENCY TO CERTIFY THE WOOD OR FOREST RISK COMMODITIES NOT BE SOURCE FROM CERTAIN REGIONS REGARDLESS OF EXISTING POLICIES TO PROTECT THOSE AREAS. THIS RUNS CONTRARY TO THE CURRENT HIGH STANDARDS FOR NORTH AMERICA SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY PRACTICES AND CERTIFICATION STANDARDS THAT APPLY CHAIN OF CUSTODY REQUIREMENTS WHICH CREATES ADDITIONAL BARRIERS FOR CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HOME BUILDERS LUMBER PRICES HAVE ALREADY SKYROCKETED THREE HUNDRED AND PANDEMIC. AND DUE TO COVERT RELATED DEMANDS SUCH AS AN INCREASED DEMAND FOR NEW HOMES AND HOME REPAIR AND WEBER RENOVATIONS. DIMENSIONAL LUMBER AND PANEL PRODUCTS ARE ALREADY AT RECORD HIGH LEVELS MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE TWENTY YEAR AVERAGE PRICE WITH THE CURRENT CHALLENGES TO OBTAIN QUALITY SUSTAINABLE NUMBER AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE TRYING TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND RESPOND TO THE STATE'S INFRASTRUCTURE GOALS THIS BILL IT'S A HUGE BARRIER IN INBOX COSTA CONSTRUCTIONS FURTHERMORE CANADA IS THE SECOND LARGEST EXPORTER OF WOOD TO CALIFORNIA TOTALING THIRTY THREE PERCENT. SO BY RESTRICTING PARTS OF CALIFORNIA'S MARKET RESEARCH FOR SUSTAINABLY HARVEST FOREST PRODUCTS ON TOP OF THE CURRENT U. S. DUTIES ON CANADIAN SOFTWOOD LUMBER. THE BILL WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE SUPPLY OF LUMBER COMING INTO CALIFORNIA. SO THIS RAISES CONCERNS FOR THE IMPACT ON OUR EFFORTS TO SECURE LOW INCOME HOUSING. BRING YOUR RESIDENCE AND WE KNOW THAT THIS WILL HAVE IMPACTS BEYOND PROCUREMENT BY DECREASING AVAILABILITY FOR ALL CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS AND CREATE FURTHER CHALLENGES FOR THE HOUSING MARKET. SO CBA HAS BEEN A STRONG LEADER IN THE GREEN BUILDING PROCESSES AND SUPPORT SUSTAINABLE MANAGED FOREST AND RENEWABLE FOREST PRODUCTS BUT EVEN WITH THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WERE CONCERNED A- TENANT CONSEQUENCES OF THE BILL. PLEA WITH TRADING PARTNERS THAT HAVE SOME OF THE WORLD'S HIGHEST AND MOST STRINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS THANK. YOU THANK YOU. HI IS THERE ANYWAY IN THE ROOM WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. KELLERMAN'S IN ON BEHALF OF SERIES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANYONE IN THE ROOM WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR CHRIS MCKAY LEE ON BEHALF OF HUMBOLDT MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANIES IN OPPOSITION AND ALSO MY COLLEAGUE ROB MUTRIE ASKED ME TO SPEAK THAT THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IS ALSO ON RECORD IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS LIMIT K. ON BEHALF OF L. PEOPLE THINK SOLUTIONS IN OPPOSITION EVEN WITH AMENDMENTS THANK YOU FOR THE COMMITTEE'S WORK I'VE BEEN ASKED TO REGISTER OPPOSITION FOR. A FEW OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AS WELL THE FOREST PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION OF CANADA. AMERICAN WOOD COUNCIL WESTERN WOOD PRESERVERS INSTITUTE AND THE INDIGENOUS RESOURCE NETWORK THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT I'VE SEEN. NO FURTHER OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM- I'LL GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT UP FOR. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS CHAIR THIS CALL ON COMEY CURIOUS AS TO WHY YOU THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT TIME FOR THIS LEGISLATION DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A GREAT TIME TO BE- PUTTING RESTRICTIONS INTO THE MARKET PLACE GIVEN THE- CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE SEEING KIND OF ACROSS THE BOARD ACROSS THE ECONOMY. I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT TIME AT THE RIGHT TIME WAS PROBABLY TWENTY YEARS AGO- THERE THE REALITY IS THAT- WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH TO PROTECT OUR TROPICAL FORCE THIS SPECIFICALLY APPLIES ONLY TO TROPICAL. FORESTS AND SPECIFICALLY ONLY APPLIES TO STATE PROCUREMENT I'M NOT UP BY HOUSING DEVELOPERS AND WHAT HAVE YOU SO- IT'S THE THAT WERE ALREADY AS WAS INDICATED BY. OTHER WITNESSES- THAT THAT SPOKE BEFORE YOU ARRIVED. WE ARE pSET IN TERMS OF COMBATING TROPICAL DEFORESTATION. WELL FOR BEHIND OUR GOALSAND- AND WE'RE TWENTY YEARS PAST DUE WISELY BROADER THAN. WELL I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A BROADER REDUCTION NARROWED IT BASED UPON OPPOSITION CONCERNS- BUT AND THAT'S WHY I WAS LITERALLY IN CANADA IN OCTOBER AND THEY WERE VERY GRATEFUL- THE MOVE BOREEL FOREST AND REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION. AND SO- IT'S ACTUALLY MORE NARROW BECAUSE OF CONCERNS RAISED BY FROM- PRIVATE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS OTHER GOVERNMENTS THEY BY THAT OUR GRIEF WE'VE NARROWED IT- BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT CHALLENGES IN OPPOSITION THAT MAYBE IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME. WELL WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE TROPICAL FORESTS. AND WE WILL REMOVE THE BOREAL FORESTS. AND SO IF YOUR SUGGESTION IS THAT WHENEVER WE RECEIVE OPPOSITION THAT IS THE WRONG TIME FOR SOMETHING THAT WE WOULDN'T GET ANYTHING. ACCOMPLISHED AT ALL- THE REALITY IS THAT OF THE LAST FOR LAST YEAR I SEE BY CBI HIS PRIMARY ISSUE WAS THE BOREAL FOREST WE REMOVED THAT THERE'S A BILL. CONSISTENTLY AND CLEARLY REFERS TO TROPICAL REGIONS ONLY- OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THE PRIMARY REQUEST WAS THIRD PARTY CERTIFICATION- AND WE ALSO- ABIDED BY THAT AND SO WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING. TO MAKE IT AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE THAT AND WE'VE ALSO EMPOWER DGS- OF IT TO COME UP WITH THE STANDARDS THAT WORK FOR THEM AND SO IN IN. WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR SINCE THE HAVE OF RETAIL AND SO- LOOK YOU KNOW WE CAN. PUT OUR HEAD IN THE SAND CONTINUE TO IGNORE. AN ISSUE THAT'S IMPACTING ALL OF US AROUND THE GLOBE OR OR NOT- THE REALITY IS THAT AGAIN THIS IS JUST STATE PROCUREMENT- PRIVATE COMPANIES DO NOT HAVE TO. CONTRACT WITH THE STATED THEY DON'T USED TO AND THE ONES THAT DO. ARE ONES THAT- YOU KNOW SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUY BUT NOT A SHIPPING COMPANY FORESTATION. THANK YOU. AT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR IF HE'S DONE ANYTHING TO- TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF SMALL BUSINESSES. WELL THERE IS THE REALITY IS THAT BY HAVING A THIRD PARTY CERTIFICATION THAT IS ACCESSIBLE- TO ALL IT ACTUALLY AND I WAS ACTUALLY. ALSO BE RECORDED YES ON A MOVE THAT APPLIED TO CONCERNS THAT THEY HAD TO MAKE SURE THAT SMALLER CONTRACTORS AND THE ABILITY TO ALSO. THE REQUEST OR OR APPLY FOR PROCUREMENT AND SO WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN ASKED OF US- WORKING WITH DGS TO MAKE SURE THIS IS AS ACCESSIBLE. AND EASY A PROGRAM TO COMPLY WITH AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS SECOND QUESTION A SHORT THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS AFFORD AGAIN TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUES- JUST A LITTLE CONCERNED FROM WHAT THE OPPOSITION TO TALK MORE WITH REGARD TO INCREASE THE COST OF MAYBE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S ANYTHING WORKING CLARIFY ON THAT ARE FOR START TO LIMIT OUR PRODUCTS COMING TO- THE STATE TO BE DEVELOPED AND I KNOW YOU HAD PREVIOUS LEGISLATION BEFORE THE MEET THE GOVERNOR VETOED ITS I'M NOT REALLY SURE IF I CAN GET THROUGH THIS TIME BUT- BECAUSE OF THAT I MAY LOOK TO LAY OFTEN FORGETS AUGUST OF FOUR HOPEFULLY CAN WITH OPPOSITION. WHAT WE EXPECT TO SUPPORT ONE SURE THAT WORK. WITH THE OPPOSITION MOVED THE GOAL LINE BECAUSE WE HAVE ACTUALLY. DONE WHAT. THE GREATEST OBJECTIONS OF% OPPOSITION OF THE ADDRESS AND NOW. THEY'RE FINDING NEW OBJECTIONS THE REALITIES IS NOT APPLY. TO PRIVATE. AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS STATE PROCUREMENT. SIMPLY STATE PROCUREMENT AND SO. IT DOESN'T APPLY TO HOMEBUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BOB AND WHAT HAVE YOU IT'S THE STATE PROCUREMENT. OF COMMODITIES. AND SO I WOULD REALLY URGE YOU TO CONSIDER. I'M NOT LAYING OFF BUT- BASED UPON- ARGUMENTS THAT DO NOT ACTUALLY ADDRESS WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THIS BILL. OF THESE ARGUMENTS ARE THERE ARE BEING USED INSTEAD. AS AS TO KIND OF SCARE US. TO NOT. GO IN THERE THE DIRECTION. TOWARDS SIMPLY- ENSURING THAT WE AT THE STATE OR. NOT CONSERVING A TROPICAL DEFORESTATION. I SAID BOY FOREST BEEN TO NOT AND THE COMMITTEE FORCES ALL DOESN'T OUR OWN FORCE- IT'S- ENSURING. THAT WE'RE NOT CONTRIBUTING TO TROPICAL DEFORESTATION AND THAT MEANS TROPICAL TROPICAL DEFORESTATION THAT'S NOT PART OF THE SUSTAINABLE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM SO IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CANNOT GET. ITEMS FROM TROPICAL REGIONS THAT JUST MEANS THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE BEING SUSTAINABLY BECAME. SO I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUSTIONS AB AND- ALSO YOUR START BY SAYING. THAT THE I LIKE YOU RECOGNIZE THE DEFORESTATION IS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR OUR CLIMATE CRISIS. I'M CERTAINLY SHARE. YOUR GOAL. I AROUND ENSURING THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT CONTRIBUTING TO DEFORESTATION. WHICH IS WHY. THIS BILL IS ADVANCE OUT ADITUS COMMITTEE ON A COUPLE OF OCCASIONS. ON HOWEVER. IT IT'S WHETHER WE'RE TALKING OUT THERE SIR ANY OTHER TOPIC IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT THE DOTS BETWEEN. YOU KNOW AND A LOT OF ONE GOAL AND A POLICY TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL I'M- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND FIVE I GUESS DGS HAD OFFERED A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TRYING. WITH THE GOAL OF A TRYING TO BETTER TARGET THE LEGISLATION. I'M I HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT YOU CAN SIT. CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE SWEEPING IMPACTS AND- THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. I GUESS IT. I IF YOU COULD ADDRESS I'M MISTER KALRA COUPLE OF THE POINTS THAT WERE RAISED. IT YOU SAID THAT IT'S FOCUSED ON. TROPICAL FORESTS MMHM FIVE. AT THE OPPOSITION MADE A POINT THAT IT INCLUDES TUNDRA CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT IT DOESN'T THAT THE IT DIDN'T THE BILL HAS NARROWED TO TROPICAL FOREST ONLY BE REASON WHY THERE'S REFERENCE THE TUNDRA IS THAT THAT'S THE GENERAL ACCEPTED DEFINITION OF PETE WHICH INCLUDES A WIDE RANGE OF POTENTIAL- OF BOOK THE GEOGRAPHIES BUT THE BILL ITSELF NARROWS IT SIMPLY A TROPICAL IT IS THE SAME- THIS IS THE SAME LANGUAGE THAT HAS BEEN THAT WAS IN THE BILL- THREE AND FOUR YEARS AGO BEFORE PAUL YEAH WAS INCLUDED- AND THERE WAS NO OBJECTION TO IT BECAUSE EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD. THAT DESPITE HAVING THAT DEFINITION THAT MAY HAVE INCLUDED THE WORDS UNDER THE BILL ITSELF IS STRICTLY RESTRICTED TO TROPICAL THAT'S WHY THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA A AND- PROBABLY THE END NUMEROUS PROVINCES OF REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION IS BECAUSE BEING REMOVED- BORIO- DEEP- AND SO THE POINT OF ORIGIN DEFINITIONS ARE LIMITED TO TROPICAL LATITUDES AND LONGITUDES VERY CLEARLY. SPELLED OUT IN THE LEGISLATION. THE YEAH MEDICARE FROM A AT A- YOU KNOW I QUESTION RESIDES IS WHY STILL BEEN OF TWO HUNDRED DECIDED TO BE LISTED IN THE AND THE- DEFINITIONS OF THIS BILL. PEATLAND IF THE FIGHT IS PERMAFROST TUNDRA PERMAFROST HUNDRED DOES NOT EXIST IN THE TROPICAL LATITUDES PERIOD IT IS SOLELY CONFINED IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE. SIBERIA CANADA ALASKA GREENLAND. AND THAT DEFINITION CREATES ITSELF AMBIGUITY AS TO WHAT THE SCOPE AND WHAT THE INTENT AND FURTHER IMPACT OF THIS BILL IS. IT AT IF OUR WITNESS CAN YELL I'D- CLARIFYING POINT YEP NOPE PEATLAND IS ABSOLUTELY FOUND IN TROPICAL REGIONS PEATLANDS ARE. HAVE BURNED THERE OUGHT IF YOU. PAID ATTENTION TO THE FIRES IN INDONESIA. A TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO ALL OF THOSE FIRES WERE PEATLANDS BERNIE. TO PEATLAND IS DEFINITELY FOUND IN TROPICAL REGIONS. AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT. IN THE DEFINITION OF THE OF THE BILL- IT DOES SAY- A THAT. A FORCE RISK COMMODITY MEANS A COMMODITY WHETHER IN RAW OR PROCESSED FORM THAT IS COMMONLY GROWN DERIVE POWER SEAT REARED OR PRODUCED ON LAND WHERE TROPICAL DEFORESTATION OCCURRED. AS THE AUTHOR SAID WE ARE COOK CLEARLY TARGETING TROPICAL REGIONS I THE BILL. UNDERSTOOD AND IF I CAN AND DOES THAT COME BACK- TO THE AUTHOR IS SO UNDERSTANDING YOUR GOAL IS TO FOCUS ON TROPICAL DEFORESTATION. AND AM I CORRECT IN UNDERSTANDING THAT IF THERE IS LANGUAGE OR FIVE PHRASING IN THE BILL THAT. MAKES THE THAT IS IT CONTRARY TO THAT STATED INTENT YOU ARE FIVE OPEN TO WORKING WITH OPPOSITION TO ENSURE THAT NOT JUST IN GOAL BUT IN PRACTICE THE BILL FOCUSES HEAVILY ON TROPICAL. UNIVERSE STATION THAT MEASURE ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WE WANT TO STRIKE OUT THE WORD PERMAFROST AND MAKES IT FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE DO THAT WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM TO DO THAT I'M JUST PUTTING THE- CAPTIVE DEFINITION BROAD DEFINITIONAL WHAT PETE IS EVEN THOUGH THE BILL FOR SQUARELY FOCUSES ON TROPICAL BUT IT MAKES THEM FEEL BETTER TO DO THAT. HAPPY TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF HOW TO MAKE IT AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE THAT WE NOT ONLY REMOVE OR L. BUT WE HAVE NO INTENTION OF- OF UP. IN ANY WAY IMPACTING OR HER HAVING ANY REGULATION ON ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF THE TROPICAL OF THE TROPICAL REGIONS OF OUR OF OUR WORLD. AT ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS SAY NINE. I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. UP I WANT TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND YOUR COMMITTEE- FOR WORKING WITH US OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS ON THIS- YOU KNOW WITH THE AS I MENTIONED THE BILL HAS BEEN NARROWED TO DEAL.

STATE PROCUREMENT TO MAKE THAT VERY VERY CLEAR- AND IT'S A BILL THAT HAS PREVIOUSLY- OBVIOUSLY. MADE IT TO THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE AND WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND DGS. TO MAKE SURE THEIR BEST PRACTICE IN PLACE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR BUSINESSES. AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR THE PER BUSINESSES TO COMPLY- AND WE JUST ALSO JUST GOT THE ADVANCE RECENTLY FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE SOME OF THE FORTITUDE TO WORK WITH THEM ON IT.

TO FILE LEGITIMATE PROTESTS WE'VE DONE THAT FOR YEARS IT WORKS FINE- WHY THE OPERATORS DON'T DO IT I'M NOT SURE BUT AGAIN THAT IS A PROCESS THAT WORKS TODAY. THERE IS A BIG DEBATEDOWNSTAIRS ABOUT IMPEDIMENTS TO HOUSING THIS IS GOING TO MAKE THAT LOOK LIKE A WALK IN THE PARK. UNDER THIS BILL. THE PAINTERS IF THERE'S NOT A UNION PAINTER ATTACHED TO THE WINNING BID LET'S PROTEST AT. THAT EVERYONE ELSE IN THAT JOB IS OUT OF WORK SAME THING JURISDICTIONAL DISPUTES LABOUR'S VERSUS PLUMBERS LABOUR'S VERSUS- CARPENTERS LABORS VERSUS LANDSCAPERS. SHEETMETAL VERSES THAT ROOFERS EVERY TIME SOMEONE'S NOT SELECTED PROTEST. THOSE BIDS ARE ONLY GOOD FOR THIRTY DAYS SO EVEN IF THE PROTEST ITSELF HAS NO MERIT WHATSOEVER. EVERYTHING IS ON HOLD AND EVERY OTHER CRAFT IS OUT OF WORK. THIS SIMPLY IS NOT A GOOD IDEA- IT WILL STALL STATE PROJECTS FOR JURISDICTIONAL DISPUTES AGAIN UNION VERSUS NON UNION AND MY MEMBERS ARE UNION- THERE IS A PROCESS IN PLACE THAT HAS WORKED. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU VOTE NO ON THIS MEASURE IT UP FOR TESTIMONY IN THE ROOM AT ANY AT WITNESSES WISHING TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING LIKE MONEGAN IN THE STATE OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANYONE IN THE ROOM WISHING TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUT I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY OPPOSITION AND I THINK THERE ARE- OTHER EXAMPLES. WHERE AT. WE HAVE SEEN AGAIN WELL INTENDED POLICIES AND IF UTILIZED AT. SHIP TO THEN I STYMIE PROJECTS AGAIN SEE WHAT SEE WHAT LAWSUITS HAVE KIND OF BECOME A WAIT A- THERE ANSWERED IT AND BEEN USED FOR BLACKMAIL HAVE BEEN USED FOR TO HIJACK PROJECTS HAVE. AT BEEN. DEPLOYED BEYOND THE INTENT OF THOSE LAWS SO IF YOU COULD JUST. AND STERN AND I GUESS SPEAK TO ANY OPPORTUNITIES THAT YOU CAN SEATS YOU SORT OF TIGHTENED THE SCOPE OF IT TO ENSURE THAT YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITHOUT HAVING THOSE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES LEADING TO. FURTHER PROJECT DELAYS AND- FOR THIRTIES FUNCTION. AND THE SO FIRST OF ALL WE'VE WE- AS A AUTHOR AND IN ESSENCE THE SPONSORS WE'VE OFFERED OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE OPPOSITION TO GIVE US SOME AMENDMENTS WERE. NOT ONLY OPEN TO IT WE I THINK WE NEED. TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF TO DATE WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT. I IF IT GETS OUT HIS COMMITTEE WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE OPEN- AND HONEST AND FORTHRIGHT TO MAKE SURE. ALL THOSE OF CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED- DON'T BECOME A PROBLEM- I WORK FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. I'VE SEEN HOW IT WORKS I'VE ALSO SEEN HOWCONTRACTORS. HAVE DONE SOME THINGS THAT WORK. ABOVEBOARD AN NFL BUT NOT HELP TO SMALL BUSINESSES OR SMALL CONTRACTORS OR EVEN OF PEOPLE WHO WERE TRYING TO GET A LIVING WAGE ARE WORKING WAGE. AND THEY HAD A PLACE TO GO AND THAT WAS SAID THE BOARD OF PUBLIC WORKS THEY HAD A PLACE TO GO AND TO EDUCATE THAT. WE NEVER HAD IN THE TWENTY FIVE YEARS I WORK FOR THE CITY BEFORE I RETIRED WE NEVER HAD ANY DELAYS IN PROJECTS AND- I WAS DIRECTOR REAL ESTATE. AND I MADE SURE THAT NONE OF MY PROJECTS WERE DELAYED AND SO UP THIS IS JUST ANOTHER HELPFUL TOOL TO ENSURE THAT DESPAIR NISSEN IN THE CONTRACTING- AGAIN- WE ARE WIDE OPEN. TO ANY AMENDMENTS. THAT THE D. OPPOSITION MAY HAVE- WE'RE NOT CLOSE TO IT. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT AT AND- BOB I THINK YOU KNOW WITH WITH THAT SPIRIT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY INTENTIONALLY URGE YOU TO CONTINUE. IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND- DETERMINE HOW DO WE THREAD HOW DO WE THREAD THAT NEEDLE EFFECTIVELY- WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLACE A RESPECTED AS RELIABLE RIGHT. THANK YOU AND WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND MADAM SECRETARY IF YOU CAN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. AB TWO FOUR FIVE FOUR MOTION IS TO PASS. AND REFER TO APPROPRIATIONS PETRIE-NORRIS HI. PATTERSON. GREAT I. LACKING NO. MEDINA HI RODRIGUEZ. AND WILSON WONDERFUL AT THAT BILL IS OUT AND- WE'LL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT ITEM THANK YOU SACRAMENTO- COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ALL RIGHT MOVING TO FILE NUMBER EIGHT AB TWO EIGHT NINE THREE. THE BILL DALEY. JOB AT. IT IS NOT DEFINITELY. AT. MISTER JONES JUST SAID DON'T MESS IT UP. I LISTEN TO BE VERY ADAM- THIS BILL PERTHE TO NEEDED FOR THE STATE THE PUBLIC AND STAKEHOLDERS TO DETERMINE THE MOST COST COST EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT STATE REGULATIONS. THIS UPDATES THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT STANDARDIZED REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS PROCESS THAT'S A MOUTHFUL AND ENSURES THAT STATE AGENCIES UPDATE THEIR ANALYSES TO REFLECT COMMENTS PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS MORE A TOP WITH THE ORANGE COUNTY BUSINESS COUNCIL AND MISTER BRAD WILLIAMS WITH CAPITAL MATRIX CONSULTING FOR BACKGROUND ON THE STANDARDIZED REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS PROCESS. TAKE CARE I WON'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO SAY THAT. IF THEY HAVE NO I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D WEAR A TOP HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BUSINESS COUNCIL HAPPY TO BE HERE AS A SPONSOR OF THE MEASURE AND- NOT A WHOLE LOT TO ADD OTHER THAN- YOU KNOW AS YOU WELL KNOW BY WHEN THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS A STATUTORY CHANGE YOU GO THROUGH A ROBUST- TRANSPARENT PROCESS- IN ORDER TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES. BUT OFTENTIMES ON THE LAWMAKING DOESN'T END WITH A SIGNATURE ON THE ON THAT BILL AND ADDITIONAL RULE MAKING IN LAWMAKING OCCURS BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH I'M THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND JUST AS YOU EXPECT A FISCAL REVIEW OF YOUR- LEGISLATION THROUGH THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE THAT FISCAL REVIEW WITHIN THE REGULATORY PROCESS. AND SO WE THINK IT'S A COMMON SENSE BILL- TO IMPROVE THE TORY PROCESS THAT- THAT'S ONGOING THREE DAY IN CALIFORNIA AND WITH THAT WE WOULD ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. MISTER HI THANK YOU MATTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M GOING TO CALL THE STANDARD REGULATORY IMPACT ASSESSMENT SERENA IF YOU DON'T MIND JUST TO WAS CONSULTING I'VE- WORKED ON- ANALYZING MANY DIFFERENT SERENA'S ANOTHER REGULATORY ACTIONS AND- I BELIEVE THAT AB TWENTY EIGHT NINETY THREE IS A GOOD GOVERNMENT BILL THAT SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVES CALIFORNIA'S RULE MAKING PROCESS- YOU KNOW IF YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT SETS FORTH A VERY DETAILED PROCESS. RULE MAKING AND THERE ARE MAJOR ROLES FOR ECONOMIC ANALYSIS ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS- AND MEANINGFUL PUBLIC PARTICIPATION AND THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS IS THAT THE RULE MAKING THE- REGULATION THAT IS ADOPTED. BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE- VERY MUCH CALL I THOUGHT I HAD A SURE OFF EFFECTIVE OF ANY ALTERNATIVE- REGULATORY PROCEDURE. AND SO THE ACCESS FOR THE AMBITIOUS OBJECTIVES BUT THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS WITH HOW IT HIS WORK IN PRACTICE AND I THINK PERHAPS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM. IS THAT THE US REYES- COMPLETED PRIOR TO WIN THE RULE THE DRAFT RULE IS INTRODUCED AND OFTEN FAILS TO LOOK T ROBUST RANGES OF ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF ACHIEVING THE SAME OBJECTIVES. SO THE WHOLE PROCESS OF SORT OF FRONT LOADED AND- THE FOCUS IS NARROW BEFORE THE PUBLIC COMBAT PERIOD BEGINS. AND SO IMPORTANTLY THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT IN CURRENT LAW THAT THE SU RIAS BE UPDATED IF A PROPOSAL IS REVISED AND SO WHAT THAT TENDS TO DO IS IT LEAVES THE PUBLIC AND THE AGENCIES SORT OF IN THE DARK ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHAT SUB AND REVISIONS TO A REGULATORY A PROPOSAL- WILL WILL HELP- THIS BILL ADDRESSES- THIS SHORTCOMING BY REQUIRING DOUBT THIS REDUCE BE UPDATED WHEN DRAFT REGULATIONS ARE MEANINGFULLY REVISED. AND IT GIVES A PUBLIC THIRTY DAYS INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT FIFTEEN DAYS TO HAVE IT'S A CHANCE TO DIGEST AND COMMENT ON SUBSEQUENT REVISIONS THERE ARE OTHER COMPANION PROVISIONS ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. INCLUDING- OUR- THE OUT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REVIEW THE SERIE A EACH TIME IT IS UPDATED AND OUT THE AGENCY INCORPORATE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE RECOMMENDATIONS OR COMMENTS. IN ITS FINAL DRAFT ANALYSIS- THERE'S ALSO A PROVISION THAT REQUIRES ABOUT THE- THE- RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW SUMMARIZES IN SORT OF A COMPACT FASHION. SO YOU KNOW I THINK BASICALLY JUST CLOSE OF THAT THESE ARE KEY. ELEMENTS THAT WILL SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVE PROCESS THAT IS ALREADY PRETTY ROBUST BUT IT CAN DEFINITELY GET BETTER HI AND THANK YOU FOR THAT. I THEIR NOTE NO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WILL GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT UP FOR TESTIMONY IN THE ROOM ANYONE WISHING TO TEST TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT.

TWENTY TWO THIRTY THREE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN YOU'RE READY. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND I AM HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY THREE- A STATE SURPLUS PROPERTIES BILL. AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY THREE SIX TO CODIFY AN EXECUTIVE ORDER AND IMPLEMENT THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON STATE SURPLUS PROPERTIES IN ORDER TO ADD AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH ARE STATE IS DESPERATELY LACKING. AND TWENTY NINETEEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER N. ZERO SIX NINETEEN IN WHICH HE ORDERED THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES. THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IN THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE STATE SURPLUS PROPERTIES FOR COST EFFECTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT THERE WERE FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PARCELS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED BUT ONLY A FEW OF THESE PROPERTIES I HAVE BEEN DEEMED SUITABLE FOR HOUSING. IN ADDITION TO THAT IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT OUT OF FORTY FOUR THOUSAND PARCELS THERE ARE ONLY NINETEEN THAT NOW HOW PERSPECTIVE HOUSING PLAN NONE OF THOSE PROPERTIES OUT OF FORTY FOUR THOUSAND. EVEN THOUGH NINETEEN HAVE SOME PLANS NONE OF THOSE PROPERTIES HAVE UNITS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN BUILT. THE STATE'S NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS SIGNIFICANT AS WE KNOW I'M JUST LEAVING HOUSING COMMITTEE WHERE WE NEED- FOR WELL OVER A MILLION NEW UNITS ACCORDING TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE A REPORT ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING. PARTNERSHIP ONE POINT FOUR MILLION LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS LACKED ACCESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. JUST TO JUMP OFF REAL QUICKLY I HAVE A TWENTY NINE YEAR OLD SON WHO. IS IN THE RENTAL MARKET AND JUST CALLED ME THIS MORNING TO GET ADVICE ABOUT NOW A TWO BEDROOM THAT IS THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED AND ORANGE COUNTY WHICH THAT UNIT WOULD HAVE BEEN. TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED A YEAR AGO AND HE IS COMPETING WITH MANY OTHERS- FOR A ONE TWO BEDROOM UNIT FOR THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED. SO THIS MEANS WE NEED TO BUILD WHERE WE CAN WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH ME TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS MARK STIVERS WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP AND- AND I BELIEVE WE'RE ONLY GOING TO HAVE MORE TODAY RIGHT. THANK YOU GREAT THANK YOU MARK STIVERS THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP AT THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ON ACCESS SITES INARGUES BEEN A RESOUNDING SUCCESS AT TODAY THE STATE HAS OFFERED NINETEEN PROPERTIES. ALREADY IDENTIFIED SHOTS SITES PER SHOW THE PROGRAM'S POTENTIAL TO CREATE THIRTY TWO THOUSAND ADDITIONAL HOMES TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S UNPRECEDENTED HOUSING CRISIS. AND MAKING THIS PROGRAM PERMANENT BY CODIFIED IN STATUTEIN INSTITUTIONALIZING THE STATE'S PROCEDURES WILL ONLY MAGNIFY THE PROGRAM'S IMPACT. AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY THREE ENSURES THAT THAT'S IMPORTANT PROGRAM WILL EXTEND BEYOND OUR CURRENT GOVERNOR. AND FURTHER PROJECT PERIODIC REVIEWS WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SITES AND HOMES THAT CAN BE BUILT. MEETING KELAS OF CALIFORNIA'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEEDS DEMANDS A LONG TERM COMMITMENT CONTINUALLY REASSESSING IN OFFERING STATE ACCESS SITE PROPERTIES FOR THE PURPOSE IS AN INTERVAL INTERVAL PART OF THAT EFFORT AND WE REALLY URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS MEASURE.
