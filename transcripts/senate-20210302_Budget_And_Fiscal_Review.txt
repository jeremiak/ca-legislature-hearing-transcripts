CAN HEAR ROCK. ROTH HERE STERN. BY KATHY. HAVE WE ESTABLISHED A QUORUM WE HAVE A FARM THANK YOU SO WE NOTE A QUORUM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. AND FOR ARGENTA TODAY WE HAVE ONE BILL. AND THAT IS THE BILL ON THE- SCHOOL RE OPENING. AND JUST AS A FEW COMMENTS BEFORE WE BEGIN. SO AS ALL OF US PAINFULLY NO THE PANDEMIC. BEGAN IN TERMS OF OUR FULL COGNIZANCE OF IT ABOUT A YEAR AGO. AND AS A RESULT TO PROTECT ALL OF OUR HEALTH MANY OF OUR DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS INCLUDING SCHOOLS AND MUCH OTHER ACTIVITY WAS SHUT DOWN. AND THAT PANDEMIC THE PANDEMIC WE ARE IN HAS DISRUPTED K. TWELVE EDUCATION ACROSS THE STATE AS WELL AS COLLEGE AND ALL EDUCATION IN EVERY ACTIVITY WE HAVE. BUT IN TERMS OF SCHOOLS FOR STUDENTS AND SCHOOL STAFF TO ADAPT. TO A- ONLINE OR DISTANCE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. THEN WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS REPRESENT AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ASSEMBLY THE SENATE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE A PATH FOR RE OPENING SCHOOLS AND GETTING OUR CHILDREN BACK IN THE CLASSROOM. WHILE EMPHASIZING OR SECURING AND INSISTING ON FIFTY MEASURES THAT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS AND THE STAFF BUT ALSO THEIR FAMILIES IN THE COMMUNITY. STAY SAFE AND WE CAN MINIMIZE THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS. IT RESPECTS THE DIFFERING LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES ACROSS THE STATE BY PROVIDING KEEP FLEXIBILITY BUT IT ALSO RESPECTS THE VIRUS BY ALSO REQUIRING CERTAIN SAFETY PROTOCOLS. THE PACKAGE PROVIDES SIX POINT SIX BILLION IN ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS COVER THE COSTS OF RE OPENING SAFELY. WOULD OF COURSE OBVIOUSLY INCLUDE. THAT TESTING- PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT- THE WHOLE VARIETY OF THINGS AS WE KNOW THAT INDOOR ENVIRONMENTS NEED TO BE SAFE. AND TO PROVIDE THE SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION AND SUPPORTS THAT WILL BE NEEDED AS STUDENTS FAMILIES AND SCHOOLS RECOVER FROM THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC. OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT THAT WE ARE CONSIDERING- THAT SIX POINT SIX BILLION TO BILLION IS PROVIDED. FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANTS TO SUPPORT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS IN THE BILL ACCORDING TO THE TIER OF THE COUNTY THAT THE DISTRICT IS LOCATED IN. TO ACCESS THIS MONEY. OR TO EAT YOU KNOW FULLY UTILIZE THE MONEY THAT WE ARE AUTHORIZING SCHOOL DISTRICTS MUST OPEN BY APRIL FIRST OR THEY WILL LOSE A PORTION OF IT. IF THE DISTRICT IS NOT OPEN BY MAY FIFTEENTH THEY WILL LOSE THEIR ENTIRE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANT NOW THAT SAID WITHIN THOSE COMMUNITIES WITH THE HIGHEST SPREAD OF COVE IT THE HIGHEST RISK. THE AMOUNT OF OPENING IS MINIMAL COMPARED TO THOSE COUNTIES WITH THE LOWER RATES OF RISK. NOTHING IN THE BILL REQUIRES A SCHOOL DISTRICT TO SLOW DOWN THEIR REOPENING PLANS INDICATES THAT THEY MAY HAVE ALREADY OPENED OR IN THE CASE WHERE THEY MAY BE OPENING EARLIER FROM THE DATES LISTED IN THIS BILL. THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL FOUR POINT SIX BILLION IN THE- LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES GRANTS WHICH ARE PROVIDED TO ALL DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE EXPANDED LEARNING TIME AND ACADEMIC INTERVENTIONS THROUGH FOR EXAMPLE BUT NOT LIMITED TO SUMMER SCHOOL. EXTENDED YEAR EXTENDED INSTRUCTIONAL TIME ONE ON ONE TUTORING OR WHATEVER THE DISTRICT FEELS IS MOST NEEDED TO HELP THEIR STUDENTS WITH LEARNING LOSS. SCHOOLS THAT WERE UNABLE TO OPEN IN TIME TO RECEIVE AN IN PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANT MAY USE 10% OF THEIR FUNDS TO COVER THE COST OF RE OPENING. AND IN ADDITION 10% IS SET ASIDE FOR HIRING. EDUCATORS WHO ARE ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDING INDIVIDUALIZED STUDENT SERVICES PARTICULARLY FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND ENGLISH LEARNERS. D. R. OPENING ALSO REQUIRES ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO HAVE CODE NINETEEN SCHOOL SAFETY PLANS- AND THOSE THAT ARE OPERATING IN A PURPLE TEAR MEANING THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE HIGHEST RISK OF COVERT STILL IS ONGOING. MUST ADHERE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH'S ASYMPTOMATIC KOBE TESTING CADENCE GUIDANCE HOWEVER THIS GUIDANCE IS FLEXIBLE FOR THOSE DISTRICTS IN THE LESS RISKY TEARS- THE AGREEMENT CODIFIES THE GOVERNOR'S ANNOUNCEMENT THE BEGINNING MARCH FIRST SCHOOL STAFF BEGINNING MARCH FIRST SO YESTERDAY SCHOOL STAFF AND FOR CHILD CARE PROVIDERS MUST BE EQUALLY PRIORITISED FOR VACCINES STATE WIDE. AND ADDITIONALLY 10% OF THE STATE'S VACCINE SUPPLY WILL BE OFFERED TO K. TWELVE EDUCATORS AND CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. AND I THINK THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE WANT. CARE TEACHERS STAFF AND PARENTS TO FEEL COMFORTABLE GETTING BACK IN THE CLASSROOM AND VACCINATIONS ARE ONE OF THE KEY WAYS TO DO IT THE BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE VACCINATION AS A PRECONDITION FOR SCHOOLS TO OPEN BUT IT DEFINITELY GIVES A PATHWAY FOR EDUCATORS AND STAFF TO GET VACCINATIONS. AN pPROVIDED FOR SUPPORTING AND ENSURING SAFE SCHOOL OPERATIONS SAFETY ENFORCEMENT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR ACHIEVING POSITIVE STUDENT OUTCOMES. AND THEN. THERE'S SOME TECHNICAL CHANGES BUT I WOULD ALSO JUST OUTSIDE THE BY MAKING TEMPORARY CHANGES IN THE GPA REQUIREMENT FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENT FINANCIALAID. THIS BILL PREVENTS STUDENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO EXCEL AND DISTANCE LEARNING. AND YOU MAY HAVE THEN EXPERIENCED A LOW GRADE POINT AVERAGE DURING THIS PANDEMIC. FROM FACING DIFFICULT TIMES THAT LIMIT THEIR FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES. SO WE WILL HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND PRESENTING THE BILL. IN LA- MAY HAVE SOME COMMENT OR MAY JUST BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER HEARING HE BILL IT IS THE ONLY BILL ON THE AGENDA. AND THEN WE WILL VOTE AFTER THE PUBLIC COMMENT- MISTER NIELSEN VICE CHAIR DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT BEFORE WE HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO. ALL RIGHT FINE LET'S GO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING CHECK SCANNER VICE CHAIR NELSON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. ERICA LEE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT THE SCHOOL RE OPENING EARLY ACTION TRAILER BILL. WHICH HAS SHEER SKINNER STATED IS A CULMINATION OF SEVERAL WEEKS OF. INTENSE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE SENATE AND THE ASSEMBLY- THESE CONVERSATIONS REALLY JUMP STARTED THE SCHOOL RE OPENING DISCUSSION SHIFTING THE DISCUSSION TO WHETHER SCHOOLS WILL RETURN TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO WHEN AND HOW SCHOOLS WERE RETURNED- WILL RE OPEN ANY SEPARATIST REALLY DEMONSTRATE THE HIGH PRIORITY THAT EACH PARTY HAS PLACED ON RETURNING STUDENTS. EDUCATORS AND STAFF SAFELY BACK TO SCHOOL. EIGHTY SIX APPROPRIATE SIX POINT SIX MILLION ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FIND TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES- INCLUDING TWO BILLION FOR IN PERSON GRANTS IN PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANTS AND FOUR POINT SIX BILLION FOR EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. THE TWO BILLION AND PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANTS WILL BE ALLOCATED TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES BASED ON AN EQUITY- FORMULA. LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA AND SCHOOLS THAT ARE IN RECEIPT OF THESE BRANDS MUST OFFER CONTINUOUS AND PERSON INSTRUCTION BEGINNING APRIL ONE. DISTRICTS MAY BEGIN PROVIDING IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AS LATE AS MAY FIFTEENTH HOWEVER THEIR GRANT ALLOCATIONS WILL WILL BE REDUCED BY 1% FOR EACH DAY OF INSTRUCTION THAT IN PERSON LEARNING IS NOT OFFERED. BUT IT CAN BE USED FOR ANY PURPOSE CONSISTENT WITH PROVIDING IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WHICH MAY INCLUDE PP TESTING CLEANING VENTILATION- SITE UPGRADES ALLERGIES. AND SOCIAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS FOR STUDENTS. THAT'S COOL ALL SCHOOLS REGARDLESS OF THEIR TIER ASSIGNMENT THEY'RE COMING TO YOUR TIME IT WILL BE REQUIRED TO OFFER OPTIONAL IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO ALL STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AND THEN COHORTS OF STUDENTS AND PRIORITIZE GROUPS AND THE PRIORITIZED GROUPS INCLUDE- PEOPLE THAT RISK- ABUSE NEGLECT. BALLS THAT ARE HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT ARE IN FOSTER CARE- ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS STUDENTS WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS STUDENTS WHO HAVEN'T BEEN ENGAGED DURING DISTANCE LEARNING. ONCE A SCHOOL IS ELIGIBLE HOWEVER UNDER PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE THEY MUST ALSO OFFER IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO AT LEAST ALL STUDENTS IN TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THROUGH THE SECOND GRADE. AND-ONCE THEY'RE IN THE RED ORANGE OR YELLOW TIER IN PERSON INSTRUCTION MUST BE OFFERED TO AT LEAST ALL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS- CATER SIX. OUT STUDENTS IN THE PRIORITIZED GROUPS AND AT LEAST ONE FULL GRADE IN THE SEVENTH THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE TO SPAM. THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION IS FOR EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITY FRANCE. BEGIN THE CRITICAL WORK OF ADDRESSING THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC FOUR POINT SIX BILLION WILL BE ALLOCATED TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. AGAIN BASED ON THE EQUITY BASED LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA- AN ADDITIONAL ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS WILL BE PROVIDED FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE HOMELESS. THE FUNDS WILL BE SUPPLEMENTAL- WILL BE FOR SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION AND SUPPORT. OF OUR SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL BEING OF STUDENTS SOMETHING VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS AT THIS TIME. THE USE OF THESE FUNDS MAYBE FOR SUMMER SCHOOL LONGER DAYS THAT'S PROVIDING MORE INSTRUCTIONAL TIME AS WELL AS ACCELERATING PROGRESS TO CLOSE LEARNING GAPS- HEARING AS AN EXAMPLE LEARNING RECOVERY PROGRAMS COMMUNITY LEARNING HOGS- AGAIN SUPPORTS FOR- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. IN ADDITION EIGHTY EIGHTY SIX ALSO CODIFIES GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE MAN ON VACCINES FOR EDUCATION SECTOR WORKERS WERE BY 10% A FIRST DOSE IS A VACCINE. WILL BE AVAILABLE. IT OPERATES YOU EDUCATION SECTOR STAFF THIS INCLUDES TEACHERS CLASSIFIED WORKERS ADMINISTRATORS- AND SCHOOL STAFF SAID AFRICA IS ALREADY UNDER WAY STARTED YESTERDAY AS- THAT YOU'RE MENTIONED AND WILL GO A LONG WAY TO GET THE STATE'S EDUCATION FACTOR IN- INCLUDING THAT THE POPULATIONS I JUST MENTIONED TO VACCINATED QUICKLY. MAYBE EIGHTY SIX ALSO CONTAINS ADDITIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY MEASURES INCLUDING REQUIRING ANY PUBLIC OR PRIVATE SCHOOL TO NOTIFY THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER NO LATER THAN TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER LEARNING O A POSITIVE CASE. ON A SCHOOL SITE. IT ALSO DOUBLES AS A SYSTEM THAT WILL PROVIDE A SAFETY REVIEW BY THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WHEN ANY SCHOOL HAS TWO OR MORE OUTBREAKS OF KOBE NINETEEN. IT ALSO OPERATES TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO THE STATES FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. THIS IS A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE BELL ON THE STATE'S SCHOOL REOPENING PLANS MY COLLEAGUE JESSICA HOLMES AND I ARE AVAILABLE TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT MEMBERS I HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M. I DON'T KNOW IF THE LA- WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT OR WHETHER THEY WANT TO JUST RESPOND TO QUESTIONS. MADAM CHAIR THIS IS GABE PRODUCT- FROM THE LA- AND- WE DID NOT PREPARE- COMMENT IN ADVANCE BUT WE ARE HERE- AND HAPPY TO RESPOND TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. EXCELLENT ALL RIGHT LET ME SEE IF THERE ARE MEMBER- QUESTIONS. STIR IN MY UP SENATOR NELSON. TO FINANCE HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY THAT THIS IS OPENING SCHOOLS WHEN IT COULD BE BUT FOR ONLY ONE SINGLE DAY. IN CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION HOW DID THEY QUALIFY TO THE FULL TIME STUDENTS IF THEY'RE ONLY IN THE CLASSROOM ONE SINGLE DAY IT'S STILL REMOTE LEARNING IS IT NOT. THE PART THAT I NEED SENATOR NELSON NELSON THISIS ERIC LEE I THINK YOUR- RESPONDING TO A HYBRID INSTRUCTION IS THAT CORRECT. THE CERTAIN CERTAIN FOUNDATION IN THE CLASSROOM AND SOMEDAY PERHAPS THROUGH DISTANCE LEARNING. SIXTY LET ME ASK THE GRANTS WOULD- ALLOW. LOCAL DECISION MAKING IN TERMS OF- HOW STUDENTS COME BACK TO SCHOOL AND IN REGARDS TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD BE A HYBRID APPROACH WHERE. STUDENTS ARE IN THE CLASSROOM FOR CERTAIN DAYS OF THE WEEK AND OUR DISTANCE LEARNING IN OTHER DAYS BUT B. AND B. AT INTENT IS TO GET AS MANY- SCHOOLS REOPEN AS POSSIBLE TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT- THE TEACHERS AND STUDENTS NEED AND SOME OF THAT MAY JUST. REALLY DEPEND ON HOW THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ALLEYS TO FIND- HOW TO IMPLEMENT THAT. IS THIS NOT CONTINUING A- HISTORIC TREND IN CALIFORNIA K. TWELVE EDUCATION OF DISCRIMINATING AGAINST CHARTER SCHOOLS. I'M I'M GONNA TRY THAT QUESTION TO MY COLLEAGUE JESSICA HOLMES IN REGARDS TO CHARTER SCHOOLS THANK YOU. YES THE HOME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SO THAT THE I THINK WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS AND THE FACT THAT OF THE TWO PROPOSALS THE TWO BILLION PROPOSAL ON THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION PROPOSAL. AND NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOL ARE NOT INCLUDED AND AS BEING ELIGIBLE FOR THE TWO BILLION IN PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANT YES AND WHAT THAT IS A REFLECTION OF. HIS DEATH THANK YOU WITH THAT IN THE REFLECTION OF THE FACT THAT- FOR FAMILIES WHO CHOOSE TO SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOL. THEY DO SO- WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT- MUCH IF NOT ALL AND DEPENDING O THE PROGRAM AS THAT- EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM WILL BE PROVIDED I'M IN A DISTANCE LEARNING MODEL SO THERE'S NOT AS MUCH- CONCERNED ABOUT BRINGING KIDS BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY'VE CHOSEN THAT THE DISTANCE DURING PEAK SOMETHING THAT THEY'VE CHOSEN. HOWEVER I WOULD NOTE THAT ALL OTHER CHARTER SCHOOL CLASSMATES CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE TWO BILLION IN FUNDING AND ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS INCLUDING ON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION. AND IN THE EXTENDED LEARNING TIME AND- ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITIES GRANT SO- THERE'S ENOUGH YOU CAN FIND THE VALUABLE. AND FOR ALL CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE BOTH GREAT. THANK CHAIR MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO HIM ASK BOTH QUESTIONS THAT I WAS SEEKING THE ANSWERS AND RESPONSES TO I DO HAVE A CONCERN- ABOUT ONE SECOND CENTER GROVE YOU'RE MIKE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ON. LET'S SEE IS THAT BETTER YES THAT'S BETTER HY HOLD THAT POLICY STARTED THAT'S OKAY MA'AM MY AT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MY I'M CALLING FROM T. HE MET- ASK THE QUESTIONS THAT I WAS- SEEKING ANSWERS AND RESPONSES TO. ABOUT CHARTER SCHOOLS AND ABOUT THE DISTANCE LEARNING ISSUE THAT WE HAVE ON THE HYBRID PROGRAM. I DO HAVE A CONCERN THAT THIS BILL HAS A LARGE FOCUS ON THE HYBRID PROGRAM WHERE. THE MONEY WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES EVEN IF THEY JUST OPENED UP ONE DAY A WEEK. I DON'T THINK THAT- OPENING ONE DAY A WEEK IS WHAT OUR PARENTS ARE LOOKING FOR. IN THE EDUCATION OF OUR CHILDREN- AND I THINK THAT- THERE SHOULD BE SOME TYPE OF ADDITION TO THIS LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES THE SCHOOLS TO OPEN. IN A CONSISTENT MANNER SO THAT PARENTS CAN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY HAVE THEIR CHILDREN EDUCATED. IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM A LOT OF THE PEOPLE IN MY COMMUNITY. CANNOT US AFFORD TO PUT THEIR CHILDREN IN AN EXPENSIVE PRIVATE SCHOOLS- PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY FOR PRIVATE SCHOOL EDUCATION THEIR CHILDREN HAVE NOT MISS THIS ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY THIS ONE YEAR GAP IN- IN EDUCATION ACHIEVEMENT. AND THEY HAVE NOT BEEN AND EXCLUDED FROM IN PERSON LEARNING. AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE IN MY DISTRICT I HAVE A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS ON THE MAJORITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL'S NEEDS PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO BE OPEN. AND I THINK- ALTHOUGH THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO INCENTIVIZE SCHOOLS. MY CONCERN IS THAT- THE SCHOOLS WILL ONLY OPEN ONE DAY A WEEK AND THAT STILL PRESENT PRESENTS A MAJOR PROBLEM IN EDUCATION FOR THE MAJORITY. OF OUR STUDENTS IN THIS STATE. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT- IS THERE TO BE ANY DISCUSSION OR MOVING FORWARD IN NEGOTIATIONS ON THE HYBRID LEARNING PROGRAM. HI SENATOR ERICA LEE AGAIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND I THINK THE ONE THING- YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS FRAMEWORK PROVIDES IS A LOT OF LCAL DISCRETION AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT A MANDATE BUT FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THAT ARE- IN RECEIPT OF FINES. THERE NEEDS TO BE A PLAN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND AGAIN THE STATE DOESN'T DICTATE WHAT THAT PLAN SHOULD LOOK LIKE- AND IT IS REALLY UP TO BE ADMINISTRATORS TEACHERS PARENTS- IN IN THOSE LOCAL. SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO DECIDE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR THEM WITH THE BEST MODEL IS FOR THEM. THANK YOU. SENATOR DRAWS YOU IN AND SENATOR MELINDA'S. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I SUPPORT THIS THE AGREEMENT OR THIS UNDERSTANDING HERE- I BELIEVE VERY STRONGLY THAT EDUCATION STAFF. NEED TO BE PROTECTED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND THAT THE STUDENTS- AND A MOTHER YOU KNOW ALL THE SCHOOL STAFF THAT NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK QUICKLY AND SAFELY AND I KNOW THAT'S BEEN THE DIFFICULT BALANCE HERE BUT WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE BOTH- IN LOS ANGELES VALLEY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CHILDREN- HAVE WORKING PARENTS AWAY FROM HOME. AND SO- THEY'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH ISSUES OF- WANTING TO GO TO SCHOOL A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER DON'T HAVE CONNECTIVITY DIDN'T HAVE CONNECTIVITY OF THE DEVICES OF- A LOT WAS DONE BY RALLY IS USD TO MAKE UP FOR THAT- BUT I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS OUT OF CONCERN FOR. THE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE THOSE CHILDREN LIVE HAVE A VERY VERY HIGH NUMBER OF CASES AND DEATHS ARE VERY DISPROPORTIONATELY- ANSWER TO QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT IS WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THE CHILDREN THAT LIVE- IN THE PURPLE TIER SUCH AS- LA COUNTY WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THIS- A PROPOSAL TO THEM- AND SECOND IS HOW DOES THIS PROPOSAL ADDRESS THE LEARNING LOSS THAT THESE OUR CHILDREN HAVE. GONE THROUGH THANK YOU MANAGER. HI ALL START- IN RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION- CALLING THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER FOR SOME MORE DETAILS TO MY COLLEAGUE JESSICA HOLMES. I'M IN REGARDS TO LA COUNTY IN ANY COUNTY THAT IS IN THE PURPLE TEAR- DEPENDING ON CASE RATES- SCHOOLS- THAT ARE IN RECEIPT OF THESE FUNDS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO- PROVIDE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO ALL STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES AS WELL AS AS COHORTS- OF STUDENTS- IN THE PRIORITIZED POPULATIONS THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE SUCH AS ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS- STUDENTS THAT ARE HOMELESS STUDENTS IN FOSTER CARE CENTER- AND SO. THOSE SCHOOLS IN PURPLE TEARS HAVE THE- THEY THEY MUST PROVIDE. IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO AT LEAST THOSE GROUPS AND MANY OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS I THINK ARE THE ONES THAT YOU'VE MENTIONED CENTER SENATOR- IN REGARDS TO- CASE RATES AS CASE RATES GO DOWN. SCHOOLS MUST OFFER- IN PERSON INSTRUCTION THROUGH THAT TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THROUGH SECOND GRADE- AND SO AGAIN THOSE ARE THOSE ARE CASE RATES- BETWEEN SEVEN AND TWENTY FIVE AND ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND- IN TERMS OF THE- LEARNING LIVES THROUGH WE HAVE THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION AND I WANT TO JUST POINT OUT THAT IN BOTH CASES THE TWO BILLION AND THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION WOULD BE ALLOCATED BASED ON- THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WHICH IS- OBVIOUSLY- HEAVILY- FORMULATED SO THAT- IT BENEFITS THE LOWEST INCOME- ELEAZAR. AND SO AGAIN YOU HAVE- THAT POPULATION I THINK IS- THE ONE THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IN REGARDS TO LA. BUT JUST IN TERMS OF THE DISTRIBUTION IT IS- BASED ON- IT'S AN EQUITY BASED DISTRIBUTION BASED ON LC ABOUT FORMULA. AND THOSE FUNDS WOULD BE ALLOCATED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN THOSE AREAS THAT ARE LOW INCOME- AND I DON'T KNOW IF I JESSICA IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT. THE FIRM. THE I. T. SHE'S TURNING ANSWERED WHEN I HEARD BACK OKAY GREAT YOUR MUTE CAN YOU GO AHEAD YES PLEASE PROCEED YEAH I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT I WAS ON MUTE AND DEAF HOME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SENATOR OUT THAT YOU BRING UP AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE AND WE HAVE HEARD SIGNIFICANT AND FEEDBACK FROM FAMILY ABOUT THAT AND THERE IS THERE IS A TENSION BETWEEN WANTING THAT MAKE SURE THE KIDS ARE BACK IN SCHOOL BUT ALSO A LOT OF CONCERN ESPECIALLY IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEVERELY HARD HIT BY CODY NINETEEN- THAT YOU KNOW THEY DON'T WANT TO SEND THEIR KIDS BACK- IF. THERE'S A RISK OF INFECTION. AND SO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE WHAT WHAT ARE PROPOSAL. THAT REALLY TRIED TO BALANCE- BOTH THE CONCERN OF HIM LEADS AND TRYING TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO FEEL SAFE AND GETTING THEIR KIDS BACK. BUT ALSO PROVIDING THEM WITH OPTIONS BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT DURING A TIME LIKE THIS. SO WHILE THE TWO BILLION REQUIRES AT LEAST OFFER- IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IT DOESN'T REQUIRE FAMILIES TO ACCEPT THAT IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. IF THEY FEEL LIKE THE DISTANCE LEARNING MODEL IS A BETTER FIT FOR THEN- IN ADDITION TO FOUR POINT SIX BILLION ALLOW UP TO. 15% OF THOSE FUNDS TO BE USED TO SUPPORT AND ENHANCE DISTANCE LEARNING. THAT BOTH BOTH YOU NEED TO CHOOSE TO STAY IN THE DISTANCE LEARNING MODEL CAN ALSO RECEIVE. AN IMPROVED SERVICE HOLD SO THAT THE OTHER TWO I THINK VERY IMPORTANT POINTS THERE I THINK- IT FINALLY I THINK ONE OF THE REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT THE FOUR POINT SIX MILLION. IS THAT THERE'S A REAL FOCUS ON EXPANDING LEARNING TIME WE RECOGNIZE THAT. STUDENTS MAY NOT HAVE RECEIVED- AS MUCH- IN PERSON OR OR AND YOUR CRITICS INSTRUCTION. OVER THE LAST YEAR AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THAT TO BE MADE UP. ON BOTH IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUT ALSO IN THE NEXT. COUPLE YEARS WELL SO THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE THAT IS FILE ANYTHING JUST TO KIND OF SPEAK TO THE OTHER MEMBERS QUESTION CAN HELP KIN OF ALL. KIND OF COME FULL CIRCLE YOU KNOW THAT THE PURPOSE AROUND INCLUDING THE HYBRID MODEL WAS TO ENSURE THAT- SOME SCHOOLS WHO HAVE MAYBE YOU KNOW. IMPACTED FACILITIES ARE LIMITED CAPACITY REGARDING A TEACHERS- CAN PROVIDE AT LEAST YOU KNOW ANY STUDENT WHO WANTS TO RECEIVE AT LEAST SOME IN PERSON INSTRUCTION THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE THAT IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. WHILE FEELING SAFE AND WELL YOU KNOW IT SURE ENOUGH. BUT THERE'S THE SOCIAL DISTANCING IN PLACE- AND THAT AND THE COMING NEXT REQUIREMENTS ARE BEING MET- THAT PARENTS FEEL COMFORTABLE SENDING THEIR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL AND SO. REALLY YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS A DIFFICULT ISSUE IN REBOUNDING A LOT OF DIFFERENT PRIORITIES BUT I THINK WE DID A GREAT JOB IN TERMS OF. THAT CONTRACT WE CAME. UP WITH AND BALANCING ALL OF THOSE PRIORITIES. SORRY CENTER DRAWS DID YOU HAVE. OTHER IT SAID THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT SO GO TO SENATOR. IS A MENTION PAM. AND THEN MAY- ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT- SHIELDS HERE MAKE THE REFLECTION HARD SOMETIMES FOR ME TO SEE IF YOUR MIKE'S UP SO- WAVE YOUR HAND IF I HAVEN'T RECOGNIZED YOU. BUT LET US GO TO SENATOR MELINDA IS AND THEN SENATOR PAN GO AHEAD SENATOR MELINDA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SO. IN IN THIS BUILD VERY SPECIAL CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO. SCHOOL'S ROCKING OFFERING IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO- THE MORE- REMEMBER HOW A REFERENCE TO THE BELL BUT THOSE WHO ARE MORE AT RISK OF BEING NEGLECTED OR ABUSED OR THINGS LIKE THAT AND I JUST. CURIOUS IF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS LOOKED AT THE NUMBERS NATIONALLY RELATING TO OUR- THE INCREASE IN ABUSE AND NEGLECT AND IF THAT WAS TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION I GUESS I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW. HOW ARE THE STUDENTS IDENTIFIED IS THAT STUDENTS WHO HAVE A COMMON SPOKEN TO A COUNSELOR HE HAD SOME. ISSUE AT HOME IT'S ALREADY DOCUMENTED IS THAT HOW WE ARE IDENTIFYING IDENTIFYING THOSE KIDS WHO ARE AT THIS PARTICULAR RISK. HI ASHLEY WITH A PERMANENT FINANCE- I THINK AND I TOTALLY WE'VE DEFINITELY BEEN HEARING THAT ABUSE AND NEGLECT ARE ON THE RISE ACROSS THE COUNTRY I DON'T HAVE. ANY NUMBERS TO SHARE WITH YOU BUT AND HAPPY TO GO BACK AND GET SOME OF THAT INFORMATION I'M SORRY. SO MY QUESTION MY QUESTION SORRY IS I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO RESPOND YES OR SOMETHING I THINK IT'S R. TWO- MY QUESTION IS HOW ARE. HOW ARE THESE AN INMATE THIS MAY NOT BE A QUESTION FOR THE LA YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY BUT OUR THE STUDENTS WHO WERE PLACED IN THE CATEGORY OF BEING MORE AT RISK FOR NEGLECT. OR ABUSE. IN THAT CATEGORY. MMHM HOW ARE THEIR- YES BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE JESSICA HOLMES HAVE- MORE DETAILS THANK YOU. CERTAINLY I'M JUST GONNA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I AM BY NO MEANS I'M AN EXPERT IN THIS DAY I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES UNIT THAT THAT MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER IN TERMS OF ANSWERING THE QUESTION BUT I DO KNOW THAT THERE'S A LEGAL DEFINITION. OF STUDENTS WHO ARE AT RISK FOR ABUSE NEGLECT AND IT IS RELATED TO- FORMAL IDENTIFICATION THERE'S A PROCESS- AND- I WOULD BE HAPPY TO COME BACK WITH MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT'S- SORT OF THE HIGH LEVEL INFORMATION I DO HAVE. OKAY AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND I DON'T MEAN TO PUT YOU ON THIS ONE I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE- THESE ARE STUDENTS THAT WOULD HAVE ALREADY HAD TO HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. BITE YOU KNOW EITHER STATE AGENCY ORDERS ALL RIGHT THAT IS NOT TAKING INTO ACCOUNT. THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO ARE NOW BEING NEGLECTED OR ABUSED IN SOME WAY SHAPE OR FORM BECAUSE- IS PANDEMIC BECAUSE THEIR HOME. ALL THE TIME FOR THE LAST YEAR I DON'T THINK IT'S TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SO FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN HERE- I THINK SOME OF THAT IS. TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS IS THAT. YEAH OR- SUMMER SCHOOL IN A OTHER. EDUCATE UP. YEAH THERE ARE THERE ARE- THE USES OF THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DO INCLUDE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL- MENTAL HEALTH AND STRESS AS WELL. OKAY MAYBE USE FOR THOSE ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION TO OUR SUMMER SCHOOL OPPORTUNITIES OR OTHER. EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT'S RIGHT. OKAY- WELL. I GUESS I WILL SAY THAT I AM HAPPY TO SEE THAT OUR LEAD MINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THE- UNSPEAKABLE HARM THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO OUR STUDENTS WITH RESPECT TO. THE INCREASE IN THE GLASS INCREASING YOUR VEHICLES- DOESN'T MAKE ME FEEL BETTER KNOWING NOW THAT. THIS MONEY IS NEEDED NOW TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT WAS CREATED BY THE STATE BY WALKING SCHOOLS DOWNPOUR HERE WE'VE HAD SCHOOLS THAT HAVE BEEN OPEN FOR MANY MANY WEEKS NOW IN SOME CASES MONTHS HAVE BEEN OPERATING JUST FINE WITHOUT INCIDENT. THE MAJORITY OF THE STATE IN THE PURPLE TEAR I'M NOT HAD THAT OPPORTUNITY- I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT OFFERING SUMMER SCHOOL IS GOING TO BE- SAVING GRACE ORGANS. YOU CAN READ WHAT IS HAPPENING AND I'VE SEEN IT IN MY OWN KIDS RIGHT THREE IN HIGH SCHOOL- MIGHT HURT THEIR FRIENDS WHO ARE IN THEIR GRADES ARE EITHER UP AND DOWN OR THEY'RE GOING DOWN. AND THAT I JUST DON'T THINK. SOMERS AND SOME OF THE OTHER. THINGS THAT A RECORD IN BILL ARE GOING TO HELP THEM RIGHT YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT BUT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. THIS LOOKS LIKE. NOT IN NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BUT IN HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE CTA AND THE GOVERNOR AND IT APPEARS. THE CTA'S WINNING- SEVERAL ARE. THIS IS NOT THE BILL THAT I WAS EXPECTING THIS BILL DOES NOT MAKE ME HAPPY THIS BILL IS. DEPRESSING TO BE QUITE HONEST WITH YOU- AS A PARENT OF STUDENTS. AND JUST DEPRESSING FOR STUDENTS IN GENERAL WHO ARE HERE FROM ALL THE TIME I DON'T THINK THIS BILL. DOES WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO IT SHOULD BE REQUIRING THAT SCHOOLS OPEN- BUT IT DOES NOT- SO RIGHT. I GUESS. I WOULD ASK YOU IF YOU CAN JUST BRIEFLY BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN THE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS- IDENTIFY OR AS WHAT WHAT. WHAT. THE GOVERNOR VISIONING THAT ALREADY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE GOING TO BE OFFERING ADDITIONAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN SUMMER SCHOOL IS THAT WHAT THE STUDENTS HAVE TO LOOK FORWARD TO IN ORDER TO GET THEIR GRADES UP AND PASS THESE CLASSES IT WOULD HAVE TO ATTEND SOME SORT OF HYBRID OR ON- ONLINE YOU KNOW SOLELY- EDUCATION TO. TO GET TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE FOR THIS WHOLE YEAR AND WHERE THEY SHOULD HAVE GONE FOR THE LAST YEAR THE THICKNESS. YES THANK YOU FOR YOUR- QUESTION JAN YOU'RE CONCERNED- CENTER MELINDA'S- I'M ACTUALLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I BELIEVE THE GOAL IS REALLY TO IN FACT MORE SCHOOLS TO OPEN AND TO HAVE AS MANY SCHOOLS OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AS POSSIBLE- THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED THAT IS ALSO CONCERNED OF THE ADMINISTRATION THAT'S WHY FOUR POINT SIX BILLION. IS ALLOWABLE TO USE FOR SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORTS THERE'S ALSO ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED MILLION. IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR MENTAL HEALTH- SUPPORTS TO SCHOOLS. FIVE THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SO JUST DIDN'T ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT- AND AN UNDERSTANDING THAT- A LOT OF STRESS AND- ANGUISH HAS OCCURRED WITH OUR STUDENTS AS WELL AS OUR TEACHERS. AND ATTEMPTING TO INVOKE GOING BACK TO MY- COLLEAGUE- MISS HOLMES COMMENT ABOUT BALANCE- VIEWS ARE THERE A LOT OF TOUGH DECISIONS THAT HAD TO BE MADE IN AND THERE IS. A BALANCE THAT WE ATTEMPTED TO STRIKE IN REGARDS TO SAFETY AND TO THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS- AND ALLOWING LOCALS TO DECIDE WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR THEM I THINK IT. IS AN IMPORTANT FRAMEWORK OF THIS PROPOSAL- I GUESS THE IDEA IS TO REALLY USE THE FUNDS TO INCENTIVIZE GOALS TO OPEN- THAT TWO MILLION AND THEN THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION TO PROVIDE THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. SOME OF THAT SUPPORT MIGHT BE BEFORE SCHOOL IT MIGHT BE AFTER SCHOOL IT COULD BE AN EXTENSION OF THE SCHOOL YEAR COULD BE SUMMER SCHOOL- AGAIN BASED ON THE NEEDS OF WHAT THAT SCHOOL AND THAT THE PARENTS AND TEACHERS DECIDE- BUT YES. IT IS IT'S- AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT THERE ARE THAT THERE IS A BALANCE THAT NEEDED TO BE- STRUCK HERE AND WE ATTEMPTED TO DO THAT IN REGARDS TO HOW THE MONEY WAS DISTRIBUTED. AND FOR WHAT- PURPOSES THOSE DOLLARS ARE USED FIRST FOR SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO RE OPEN 10% OF THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION- IS IT IS SATISFIED FOR. ENHANCED DISTANCE LEARNING AND TO PROVIDE- WHAT WE HOPE SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS AND STUDENTS NEED- BUT BOTH FOR IN. PERSON AND DISTANCE LEARNING INSTRUCTION. OKAY WELL- LIKE I SAID I I'M GLAD TO SEE THE YOUNG. ACKNOWLEDGES WRECKING. THE TRUCK. DAMAGE THE HE'S DONE WITH THESE. BACK RULES CLOSED FOR YOUR BUT WE- HAVE MORE TO DO THANK YOU. SENATOR MELINDA IS ARE YOU A- DID YOU FINISH YOUR QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT WE WILL YEAH. THANK YOU WE WILL GO TO- SENATOR PAN AND THEN SENATOR MEN. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I HAVE A FRIEND COMMENTED THREE QUESTIONS- SO FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANT BEGIN BY THANKING- OUR- THE FOLKS HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE I KNOW OUR BUDGET CHAIR NANCY SKINNER- SEVEN. ONE CHAIR- LAYERED AND OUR EDUCATION CHAIR SO LEAVE US FOR THE HARD WORK AND- HELPING PUT THIS- GREENMAN TOGETHER AND JUNCTION WITH THE ASSEMBLY AND ALSO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE MY KNOWLEDGE THAT- GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AT LEAST REACH OUT TO MY OFFICE IS EARLY AS NOVEMBER TO TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT CAN WE DO TO TRY TO GET SCHOOLS RE OPEN. AND AS A PEDIATRICIAN AND AS A PARENT OF. TWO CHILDREN WHO. ARE ATTENDING. PUBLIC SCHOOLS. CERTAINLY THE IS A ISSUE IS OF- PERSONAL IMPORTANCE. AND I KNOW THAT MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES IN PEDIATRICS I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF TRYING TO. RETURN TO IN PERSON LEARNING- SAFELY- AS A WAY TO BOTH ADDRESS LEARNING ISSUES AS WELL AS EVEN- MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES RAISE AGE. RELATED TO- SOCIAL ISOLATION AND- ACCOMPANYING- DEPRESSION ANXIETY SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT- WE'VE BEEN. TALKING ABOUT AND I THINK THAT THIS AGREEMENT CERTAINLY IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD- AND ADDRESSING THOSE ISSUES. I WOULD MAKE NOTES- THAT- FRANKLY THAT DAY HERE IN THIS STATE WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL AFFECT THE ELECTOR SCHOOL BOARDS THEY'RE LIKE THAT OFFICIALS WE- MAKE A LOT OF DECISIONS- FOR SCHOOLS LOCALLY AND FACT HERE'S A LEGISLATURE WE'VE- ALSO. TAKEN STEPS TO TRY TO. DIFFER MORE TO OUR LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS TO- AND- TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT AFFECT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT- YOU KNOW ARMED FORCES- OUR PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT AND EVEN IN THE STATE AND- THEY'RE SOMEWHAT UNEVEN BECAUSE THE STATE HAS NOT AND- YOU KNOW I. PERSONALLY I THINK WE PERHAPS SHOULD DONE MORE BUT I THINK SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO WOULD I WOULD OBJECTED. IF THE STATE WAS MORE. HEAVY HANDED IN TRYING TO ENFORCE PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES AND THEN WE HAVE BEEN AS A STATE AND INSTEAD DEFERRED MORE TWO. COUNTIES AND- INCLUDING- LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DO THAT OR NOT TO ENFORCE AND IN FACT- THAT UNEVEN ENFORCEMENT IS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO. A LONG BLOCK YOU KNOW FOR SO LONG AND- ISOLATION AND SOME OF THE EFFECTS THAT PEOPLE REFERENCE SO I THINK THAT- IS INTERESTING THAT PEOPLE ARE OBJECTING TO THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S NOT CLOSE ORDERING OR FORCING OPENING OF SCHOOLS- BUT YET- IF NOT CALLED ON THE GOVERNOR ALSO TO A MORE. STRINGENTLY ENFORCE PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES THAT WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY- PERHAPS PREVENTED DEATHS AND- AND- MORE PROLONGED- CHALLENGES WITH WITH CODED BUT WITH THAT- I DID WANT TO TRY TO GET TO MY QUESTIONS- SO FIRST OF ALL. I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT- WE'RE PROVIDING SOME FUNDS TO BILLION TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE SCHOOLS TO OPEN EARLY- THAT WE ARE ALSO FOR C. THREE OPENING- ALSO CALLING ON THE SURE SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOLLOW PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES FOR SURVEILLANCE TESTING- IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDS THAT ARE ALSO PROVIDED IN THIS BILL. I CAN PERHAPS- SOMEONE CAN SPEAK TO WHAT STATE IS ALSO DOING TO PROVIDING THINGS LIKE- PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO SCHOOLS WE KNOW THAT IN ORDER TO SAFELY REOPEN SCHOOLS WE NEED TO PROVIDE MASKS OTHER NEEDS TO BE VIGOROUS MASK. THE FORCE OF MASK WEARING END OF LIFE IN SCHOOLS AS WELL AS OTHER PDP OUT PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND ALSO THE VEIL AVAILABILITY OF LOW COST TESTING I KNOW WE'VE STOOD UP THE STATE LAB AS WELL SO WHILE THEY'RE NOT DIRECT BUDGET ALLOCATIONS TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEY DO HELP REDUCE SOME OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SAFE REOPENING AND SOAK- COULD. THE MINISTRATIONS ADMINISTRATION TO SPEAK TO WHAT OTHER SUPPORTS% FOR FIREFIGHTING THE SCHOOLS TO HELP THEM REOPEN SAFELY IN. TERMS OF PROVIDING THOSE TYPES OF. NOT EDUCATIONAL SO. AND SERVICES TO HELP THEM REOPEN SAFELY. SENATOR PAT I'M GONNA TURN THIS QUESTION OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE FOR THE DETAILS IN REGARDS TO PPP AND OTHER- EQUIPMENT THAT'S AVAILABLE TO SCHOOLS. THANK YOU. THE HOME DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- YES YOU ARE CORRECT- SENATOR PAN AND IDENTIFYING THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL OTHER INITIATIVES THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON ON THE OUTSIDE OF THIS PROCESS TO HELP SCHOOLS AND GET THAT IT'S A PRIVATE THEY NEED. TO PROVIDE A SAFE AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT WHILE BRINGING STUDENTS BACK IN PERSON. AND SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE FALL THE LAST THE BEGINNING OF THIS CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR- THE STATE PROVIDED SIXTY DAYS WORTH OF PIZZA EVERY SCHOOL IN THE STATE. AND YOUR COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION- AND THEN IN ADDITION- CURRENTLY AND I'M NOT I'M NOT QUITE SURE OF THE TALENTED AND THIS MAY HAVE ALREADY GONE OUT OR MAYBE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW BUT WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY DAYS OF PPE- TO SCHOOLS AS WELL AND THAT'S IN THE FORM OF THINGS LIKE MASKS- AND GLAD. AND SANITIZER THE ALL OF THE FATURES ARE PROVIDING. TICKET TO SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE. IN ADDITION TO THAT IT YOU MEANT. WE HAVE BEEN- WE PUT UP THE LUNCH ALAS AND BOTH INCREASE THE- FROM PROTESTING ACROSS STATE BUT I TO. THE OF TESTING ACROSS THE STATE- AND TRY KEEP FROM THE- DIFFER. ACCESSING FOR SCHOOL- AND OUT OF THE PICTURE. TRY TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR SCHOOLS O DO SOMETHING THAT THEY DON'T NORMALLY DO WHICH IS PROVIDE FOR- TESTING THAT COULD BE NINETEEN TESTING- THAT THAT. THAT CURRENTLY WE HAVE MORE THAN A HUNDRED DELEGATES THAT HAVE ARE PARTICIPATING IN THE BORN ALIVE RIGHT NOW. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT MORE ASPECT PARTICIPATE WE DEFINITELY SEE THE COST OF THAT GOING DOWN. EVEN MORE THAN THEY ALREADY ARE- I KNOW THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY ALSO- RECALL AND SEEKING A WAIVER FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT FEDERAL MEDICAID PROGRAM- AND TO TRY TO. ENSURE THAT ANY STUDENT TESTING FOR STUDENTS WHO QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID. AND IT'S COVERED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE WORKING ON. SOME REALLY HARD WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO OBTAIN. THERE ARE SEVERAL AND YOU KNOW AND YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL DIFFERENT INITIATIVES OUTSIDE THE PROCESS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON TO. TRY TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE THAT THAT HEALTHY AND SAFE. ENVIRONMENT OKAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE ANSWER SO IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE THIS TYPE SUPPORTS AND- JUST WON'T RECOGNIZE IT THERE IT DOES OUR EXPENSES THAT- THAN EITHER THE STATE OR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD BE TAKING ON THAT WOULD HELP US OPEN SCHOOLS SAFELY. AND WHAT NOT AND HOPEFULLY NEED TO COME OUT OF THE FUNDS THAT WERE OUT PUTTING INCLUDING IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL. BUT THE NEXT QUESTION I HAVE IS ACTUALLY ABOUT THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION. AND GENERAL FUND FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH SAFE SCHOOLS FOR ALL TEAMS. I THINK AT THE END IN PREVIOUS ITERATIONS ADVERTS THAT WE PROVIDE A SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR THEM SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE THE KIND OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THESE ARE YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS- THE TEACHERS AND STAFF- ARE WORKING VERY HARD TO. THAT WHILE THERE ARE SCHOOL NURSES TO BRING HEALTH EXPERTISE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. WE PROVIDE THAT KIND OF SUPPORT SO CAN YOU SPEAK PERHAPS A LITTLE. ABOUT WHAT THAT DOES FUNDS BE KIND OF A PASS YOU'RE GOING TO IN THE STATE SCHOOL FOR ALL TO UP THIS FUN FOR THAT THIS FUNDING WE CONTRIBUTE SET THIS HELP THE SCHOOL THIS. FIELD REAL SAY OR. I AM HONORED. WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE YES FIVE MAY. A ABOUT. FORCED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THOSE DISTRICTS THAT OULD NEED IT IN REGARDS TO ANY QUESTIONS THEY MIGHT HAVE FOR RE OPENING- ALL ALONG THE POLICIES INCLUDED FIVE- REQUIRED THROUGH. RECEIPT OF THE GRASS- BUT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO JESSICA HOLMES IS HERE SHE HAS MORE DETAILS IN TERMS OF CAPACITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CERTAINLY TO THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION THAT YOU REFERENCED IS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH COGNITIVE STATUS THE SCHOOLS FOR ALL TEAMS- IN ADDITION TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. FUNDING IS AVAILABLE FOR ENFORCEMENT- AND ALSO TO YOU- PROVIDE AN EDUCATION TO THE EXTENT THAT A SCHOOL IS HAVING ISSUES WITH THINGS LIKE AN OUTBREAK. SO BUT THE BILL ACTUALLY INCLUDE STATUTORY LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES THAT ANY SCHOOL SITE THAT HAS. TWO OUTBREAKS OF CODE THAT NINETEEN- THAT THE STATE SCHOOLS FOR ALL TEAM WOULD COME IN AND DO AN AUTOMATIC SAFETY REVIEW- SO THAT'S AT YOU KNOW A NEW PIECE THAT EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PIECE- AND- AND THE IDEA THERE IS. TO ENSURE THAT NUMBER. THE TYPICAL CROPPING CAN LOOK AT WHAT THE PLAN IS THE CURRENT THANK YOU PLAN HOW THING EXECUTED TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ELEAZAR. ON THE HOW THE FULL SITE TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE MAKING THE CORRECTION IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT HEALTH AND SAFETY CAN BE. ENSURED IN AN IN PERSON STARTING- ADDITIONALLY. AS WE HAVE NOTED% BEFORE AND WE DO HAVE. A A FREE PHONE NUMBERS THAT AND ANYONE IN THE COMMUNITY CAN CALL IN IF THEY HAVE CONCERNS. ABOUT THE CONDITION THAT THEIR SCHOOL FOR IN PERSON LEARNING- TO HAVE THE STAPLES FOR ALL CAN COME OUT AND TAKE A LOOK AND MAKE SURE THAT THINGS ARE BEING DONE. I'M IN A HEALTHY AND SAFE MANNER AND AGAIN. YOU KNOW THE INTENT HERE IS NOT TO BE PUNITIVE BUT TO BE PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO ENSURE. THAT WE CAN KEEP THE DOORS OPEN THE SCHOOLS AND THAT IT CAN BE DONE SO SAFELY. SH I'M LOOKING I WOULD NOTE ON THE FUNDING IS THAT WE ARE ALSO. WORKING ON- WHAT THE HIRING WILL BE WHAT AT WITH THAT CAPACITY BUILDING WILL ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WHEN THE WORKING ON THAT. AND THEY WILL BE PROVIDING- AN EXPENDITURE PLAN AND REPORT TO THE JAIL BC FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S. REVIEW I'M PRIOR TO THE EXPENDITURE OF THOSE FUNDS SO. THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS TO THINK WHAT THE EXPENDITURES WILL SUPPORT. TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE IN AN AGREEMENT. WHAT THAT WHAT THAT ADDITION SUPPORT SHOULDN'T LIKE. THANK YOU SO MUCH YOUR ANSWER I THINK IT IS A IMPORTANT HAVE THAT- PUBLIC HEALTH THE PART TO BE ABLE TO IF THERE ARE L. SINCE. FAILED TO GATHER DATA WE HAVE THAT IF SO WE KNOW REMOVING HOW TO SCHOOLS. SEVERAL OTHERS RESEARCH OUT THERE NEED TO GET THE AROUND SO EXTREME IMPORTANT THAT WE DO CONTACT TRACING AND OUTBREAKS THAT ARE DATA FIVE POSITIVE CASES AND SO FORTH AND- I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THE EARLIER I DID RAISE CONCERNS THAT WITH A THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICT WE NEED MORE CAPACITY BILL TO HELP ALL OF THEM AND I APPRECIATE THAT THAT'S BEING DONE THROUGH THIS ALLOCATION. I WOULD ALSO- JUST MAKE NOTE THAT- THAT YOU KNOW- BUT THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE ACTUALLY DID NOT TRY TO CODE OF FIVE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE BUT ALLOWED PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE TO FOLLOW THE SCIENCE BECAUSE WE KNOW WE CONTINUE TO GATHER-MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE VIRUS THE VARIANCE- ETCETERA SO IT'S AGAIN IN ORDER SURE THAT WE- STAY ON TOP OF SCHOOL SAFETY THAT- WE ACTUALLY BE ABLE WE CAN DEFER TO THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOLLOW THE LATEST SCIENCE ON THE PANDEMIC AND THEN FINALLY MY LAST QUESTION. I APPRECIATE THAT- WE'RE GOING TO BE PRIORITIZING- SCHOOL WITHOUT TEACHERS AND SCHOOL STAFF AND CHILD CARE- WORKERS AS WELL FOR BACKS FOR THE FOR THE FIRST TEST OF THE VACCINES- AND- I DECIDE CLARIFIED THAT ONCE THEY HAVE ALL BEEN OFFERED THE VACCINES THAT WE ARE- I CERTAINLY WOULD WANT TO CONTINUE TO OFFER THEM VACCINATIONS AND THAT'S GOING TO BE. AN IMPORTANT PART OF. THE SCHOOL SEE YA TERMS OF. TRYING TO PREVENT ANY OUTBREAK IN SCHOOLS BETWEEN STAFF MEMBERS. THAT- THIS PROVISION. WILL ALSO ONCE WE HAVE OFFERED TO ALL THE- THE PEOPLE IN THE CATEGORY THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO CALL. WHEN I GET THAT WELL BASICALLY THAT WE CAN BE SURE WE CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THE VACCINES INTO THE GENERAL POPULATION- LOUD IN ADDITION. YES CENTER PANAMERICAN LEE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AND YES THE 10% IS A MINIMUM ON A WEEKLY BASIS TO PROVIDE TO THE EDUCATION WORKFORCE- AND OBVIOUSLY THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE- READY ACCESS AS WELL AS I. MEAN OPPORTUNITY AND- QUICK- DOES ACCESS TO THE VACCINATIONS FOR THIS GROUP- AND IN REGARDS TO- YOU KNOW THE GOAL OF. OF DEATH IS IT IS BY THE END OF THE SUMMER TO HAVE TWENTY FIVE MILLION PEOPLE VACCINATED. AND STARTING WITH THIS CAR ABOUT FOR TEACHERS IS- THE BEST WAY TO GET MORE SCHOOLS OPEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER THAT- MINIMUM OF 10% TO THIS COHORT. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH- BUT MAY NOT THAT TO LEAVE SEEN AND HOW CARE FOR SO. WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF PEOPLE IN GROUP ONE AA THAT WE ACTUALLY SEE A DRAMATIC DROP IN THE- NUMBER OF CASES OF COVERT HOPEFULLY OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WILL DO THE SAME AND- VARIOUS- ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING THE PEOPLE WORK WILL. WILL VIGOROUSLY URGE THEIR MEMBERS TO GET VACCINATED SOON CAN SHE THOSE LEVELS OF VACCINATION. AND APPRECIATED THIS OPPORTUNITY IS THERE FINALLY JUST WANT TO SAY THAT- UNITED OPPORTUNITY GO TO A SCHOOL DISTRICT IN MY OWN DISTRICT US ELK GROVE UNIFIED YESTERDAY. AND TALK TO SUPERINTENDENT ABOUT THE VARIOUS CHALLENGES SO I KNOW THAT PEOPLE HERE RAISING ISSUES ABOUT THE HYBRID AND- YOU KNOW SCHOOLS GOING TO REALLY BE OPEN AND SO FORTH AND I. YOU KNOW HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO THE TEACHERS AND THE SUPERINTENDENT AND OTHERS. THEY WANT TO OPEN A SHIFT AND OPEN IS NOT REALLY THE RIGHT WORD THEY WANT TO GO BACK IN PERSON BE BEEN OPENED EVEN TEACHING. THE DISTANCE LEARNING BUT THEY WANT TO GET BACK IN PERSON AND THEY REALLY DO. AND THEY'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD AT IT. YEAH THERE'S ACTUALLY A CHALLENGES FOR EXAMPLE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS SOME STUDENTS ARE IN YEAR ROUND- SOME STUDENTS ARE YOU KNOW MORE TRADITIONAL SCHEDULES- YOU KNOW IT'S THE OF DIFFERENT BREAK SCHEDULES- DIFFERENT SUMMER SCHEDULES ETCETERA. AND IT'S HARD FOR US UP HERE IN THIS CHAMBER TO SIT THERE AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DICTATE THAT TO THEM. AND I THINK MANY OF US OFTEN TIMES- NETFLIX MY COMMENTS ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL IS THAT WE DO THAT- WE UNDERSTAND THAT. BABY ONE SIZE FITS ALL ISN'T NECESSARILY THE BEST WAY TO GO AND SOMETHING AS SPECIFIC AS IN PERSON LEARNING SO. I DO APPRECIATE THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL WE ARE INCENTIVIZING SCHOOL DISTRICTS I THINK THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS WANT TO DO THIS. AND THAT- AND THAT- YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT TRYING TO BE OVERLY RESTRICTIVE AND TELLING THEM HOW TO DO IT AS MUCH AS- GIVING THEM A PRETTY GOOD KNOWLEDGE AS WELL AS THE RESOURCES WHICH ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO DO IT SAFELY. SO IT THAT. I URGE SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU- P. NOW WE HAVE. A SENATOR MITCH. AND FOLLOWED SENATOR NIELSEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR BY THE NUMBER THAT BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ONE ON EDUCATION AND A FATHER THREE KIDS WHO I HOPE OUR ON ZOOM RIGHT NOW ATTENDING THEIR- ONLINE CLASSES I JUST TO SAY AND I AM ABSOLUTELY THRILLED ABOUT THIS AGREEMENT TO RE OPEN IN PERSON INSTRUCTION OR NOT K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS. I AM GRATEFUL TO GOVERNOR NEWSOM OUR LEGISLATIVE LEADERSHIP AND ALL OF THE MANY STAFF THAT WORKED SO HARD ON THIS DEAL- IN BALANCING A LOT OF COMPETING INTERESTS INCLUDING- WHAT THE SCIENCE TELLS US ABOUT COVIDIEN SAFETY. WITH THE DESIRE TO RESUME AND GET BACK TO NORMALCY- MITIGATING THE LEARNING LOST THE TWENTY TWENTIES BROUGHT ON AND- YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN THAT THIS IS A TOUGH TOUGH- SITUATION. IS STATEWIDE PRIORITIES BALANCING THAT WITH LOCAL CONTROL SOMETHING MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO MENTIONED- YOU KNOW WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF KIDS RIGHT NOW THAT ARE SUFFERING AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW THAT COVERT NINETEEN HAS CLAIMED OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND LIVES IN THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING. MANY THOUSANDS IN MY DISTRICT IN SENATE DISTRICT THIRTY SEVEN I ALSO WANT TO MENTION REALLY BRIEFLY THAT I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE DO NO HARM PROVISION FOR THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE OPENED ALREADY. THIS WAS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN MY PART OF ORANGE COUNTY WHERE WE HAVE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE RESUMED EITHER FULLY IN PERSON ARE HYBRID MODELS OF INSTRUCTION- AND SO THAT DO NO HARM PROVISION IS- IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT I KNOW THAT MY ELEAZAR WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THAT THIS WOULD MADE IT INTO THE FINAL. DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK I GUESS MY QUESTION IS RELATED TO- THE FALL SEMESTER- I I'M APPRECIATIVE OF THE FACT THAT THIS PARTICULAR DEAL WILL HELP US RE OPEN MANY SCHOOLS ACROSS CALIFORNIA I DO THINK IT NEEDS TO BE A PRIORITY FOR US TO REOPEN ALL SCHOOLS IN SOME FORM OR ANOTHER- BY THE FALL IDEALLY FOLEY- I'M A COMMAND AND A LOT OF. MY LOCAL SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ARE TELLING ME THAT. THEY WILL SOME. ON DISTANCE REQUIRE. FOR CDP- IF IT'S SIX FEET AS IS THE CASE NOW THAT'S IF THAT'S A HARD SIX FEET. I'M TOLD THAT THEY'LL HAVE TO MOVE TO HYBRID OR OR SOME SIGNIFICANT COHORT BASED MODELS- AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS HAVE THERE BEEN DISCUSSIONS WITH CD P. H. R. IN A THIS IS DIRECTED THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ANTONIO- ON. YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE MIGHT BE SITUATIONS WHERE THAT MIGHT BE RELAXED TO FOUR FEET OR THREE FEET. HIGH IF CERTAIN OTHER GUIDELINES ARE MET REGARDING P. P. E. REGARDING BACKGROUND INFECTION RATES OR ANY OTHER FACTORS- IN IF IT'S GOING TO BE SIX FEET- HOW THAT MIGHT LOOK GOING INTO THE FALL. MONTHS WHAT GUIDANCE MIGHT BE GIVEN. SENATOR ACTUALLY WITH IT OF FINANCE- I BELIEVE IS A WAIVER PROCESS IN UNDER REVIEW RIGHT NOW BUT I WILL- TRY THIS QUESTION OVER TO JESSICA HOMES FOR SOME MORE DETAILS. THANK YOU. IT MADE A- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. SO VERY RECENTLY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PUT. INTO PLACE THE WAIVER PROCESS AND ALLOWS A LIAISON THAT HAD CHALLENGES AROUND SPECIFIC- HEALTH AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE STATEWIDE GUIDANCE- TO HAVE THEIR TICKET PLANS REVIEWED BY LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH JURISDICTION IN THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH- TO. TO PROVE. TO OTHERS PEOPLE WAIVER THAT ALLOWS THEM TO PROVIDE INSTRUCTION- IN AND IN A WAY THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY FULLY. COMPLIANT WITH THE GUIDANCE BUT THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT. OTHER MITIGATION FACTORS THAT THAT THE ALLEY A PUTTING INTO PLACE TO ENSURE HEALTH AND SAFETY. SO AND ADD THAT THAT AND- I DO KNOW THAT THAT PROBABLY DON'T HAVE A TON OF DETAILS ABOUT IT I'M NOT A PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS. I DO KNOW THAT THAT- PART OF THAT PROCESS INCLUDES. LOOKING AT THE- SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS- THAT ARE IN THE CURRENT GUIDANCE SO- YOU KNOW HAPPY TO CONNECT YOU UP WITH SOME OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH IF YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. AROUND THAT WEEK OR PROCESS. OKAY YOU VERY MUCH ARE PRETTY. AND I JUST WANNA. THAT I THINK THAT GOING TO BE IN AND I. THINK THAT WE ARE GONNA. HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL. ARE- OPEN IN SIX. FOR IF NOT FULLY- BY THIS FALL THERE HAS TO BE REALLY JUST ARE ARE HARD BACKSTOP. THANK YOU SO MUCH SO FOR ALL YOUR WORK. THANK YOU- NOW SENATOR NIELSEN. THE FINANCE. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WE HAVE. ELIMINATE TESTING. I DON'T SEE ANYTHING IN THIS LEGISLATION RELATED TO TESTING OF OUR STUDENTS TO SEE WHAT HAS BEEN THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF THIS DISTANCE LEARNING WE HAVE BEEN FORCED TO HAVE TO INDOOR AND IMPOSE ON OUR CHILDREN- HOW WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND TENDING TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS- IN THE FUTURE HOW WILL WE HAVE A DEFICIT THAT I REACH STUDENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED A DEFICIT IN EDUCATION BASED ON TESTING WELL HOW WILL WE QUANTIFY. HOW BADLY OR IF NOT OUR STUDENTS HAVE BEEN HURT BY THIS DISTANT LEARNING. THANK YOU. FOR THAT QUESTION DIRECTLY INTO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I THINK THERE IS GENERALLY KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT- MANY MANY STUDENTS ARE. ARE BEHIND IN REGARDS TO LEARNING AND PART OF THE THAT WILL A LARGE CHUNK OF THIS- ALLOCATION OF FOUR POINT SIX BILLION IS REALLY THERE TO SUPPORT- THE LEARNING LOSS AND TO PREVENT FURTHER- LOSS FROM OCCURRING- IN REGARDS TO FUTURE- TESTING AND OR OTHER MEANS BY WHICH TO WEIGH WHAT THAT LOSS IS- THAT THAT ISN'T. YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IS NOT PART OF THIS AND I'M NOT VISION AS PART OF THIS PACKAGE THIS PACKAGE IS REALLY MORE GETTING KIDS BACK INTO SCHOOL- GETTING TEACHERS BACK INTO SCHOOL FOR IN PERSON. INSTRUCTION AND SENDING THEM THROUGH THESE CRAMPS AND THEN PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PHYSICAL SUPPORTS TO HELP THEM ADDRESS SOME OF THAT LEARNING LOSS- IN THE FUTURE IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR TEACHERS TO- FIND OUT EXACTLY WHERE THEIR STUDENTS ARE AND TO MODIFY INSTRUCTION ACCORDINGLY- BUT THIS. BILL IT REALLY IS TO GET SCHOOLS REOPENED AND STUDENTS BACK- IN WHETHER IT BE IN HYBRID HYBRID OR FULLY BACK. DEPENDING ON HEALTH AND SAFETY. YOUR CURRENT AND LET ME FOR THE J. OF THAT- WE'VE BEEN MOVED IN THE DIRECTION OF NOT. TESTING TEACHERS EITHER TO CERTIFY THAT FOR EXAMPLE THEY ARE COMPETENT IN MATH AND ENGLISH. IF YOU HAVE A TEACHER I THINK IT'S CBS IS ONE OF THE TESTS. OF WE CAN HAVE A DOUBLE. DOUBLE IMPACT HERE ON OUR STUDENTS SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT AND SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION SOME TESTING OF TEACHERS END OF STUDENTS BE INCORPORATED. SO WE CAN ASSESS WHERE WE REALLY ARE- THE CHECK IT SOUNDS LIKE IN THE NATION WE'RE STILL VERY NEAR THE BOTTOM IN. READING AND MATH STILL. ALL RIGHT LET ME SEE IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER MEMBERS WITH MIKE SEVEN. SENATE US SKEWS ME SENATOR. PHOTO OF BIG AND THEN SENATOR LARRY. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO SPEAK- I HAVE A QUESTION. THE SERVER.% OKAY I'M THE QUESTIONS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW DOES THIS MONEY RELATE TO THE PROP NINETY EIGHT- MONIES AND THE DEFERRALS OF DISTRICTS SAW THIS FOR THIS YEAR. HI I HAVE A QUESTION OVER TO JESSICA HOLMES. THANK YOU TO CRITICAL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO UNDERSTANDS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE BILL ARE FINE THAT ARE AND AT A BILLABLE TO PROP NINETY EIGHT- FOR BOTH THE NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR FISCAL YEAR AS WELL AS THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR TO BE DEFINED- THAT- WERE INCREASES TO OUR AFTERNOONS- FOR BOTH OF THE FISCAL YEARS- AND THAT AS WE DID NOT ANTICIPATE. ANOTHER TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT- IN TERMS OF HOW THEY ARE AND HOW THEY ARE CONNECTED TO THE DEFERRAL SO I'M WE ARE FULLY PAYING OFF DEFERRALS AND IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEAR- WE ARE PROPOSING AN INCREASE IN DEFERRALS IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUT AGAIN THE SUN- ARE ALLOCATED OUT OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEARS. ON THERE ONE TIME FIND THE NATURE OF THE WOULD NOT BE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE USED FOR AN ONGOING BASIS TO SUPPORT ON GOING FUNDING WHICH IS- THE PURPOSE AS THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO DEFERRAL IS TO. RECOGNIZE THAT THE DEARTH OF. ONGOING FUNDING THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR SCHOOL. SIR JUST SO I UNDERSECRETARIES. THESE FUNDS ARE ASIDE THE THESE ARE FROM THE- ADDITIONAL MONIES THAT YOU FOLKS HAVE RECEIVED OR WILL BE RECEIVING THAT WERE NOT PLANNED ORIGINALLY. AND IT EVOKES WE'RE STILL PLANNING ON PAYING OFF THE DEFERRALS THIS YEAR AT THE STILL GOING TO BE IN EFFECT THIS YEAR FOR. I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND I'M SORRY THE- WHERE DID THE DEFERRALS FOR THIS YEAR. OF FALL- WITHIN THE BUDGET YEAH. YOU KNOW THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND A DEFERRAL PIECES INCREDIBLY COMPLEX A COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN MY POLITICS IF I'M IF I'M BEING CLEAR ON THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACTUALLY PROPOSED ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AND DEFERRALS FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR FISCAL YEAR. AND HAD PLANNED. YEAH I HAD A PLAN ON PAYING BACK AND IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR WE'RE STILL PLANNING ON DOING THAT. HOWEVER THE COST AND THINGS LIKE ALTHEA AND- COLIJN- AND ONGOING COSTS OF EDUCATION THAT WE'RE PROJECTING IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AND ON INTO FUTURE YEARS- MORE THAN WE HAVE AVAILABLE IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FINE. AND SO WE ARE PROPOSING THAT THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION IN DEFERRALS- BE APPLIED TO THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR FOR ON GOING COSTS- SHE- AND SO I JUST WANT TO KIND OF. LAY OUT THE FACT THAT THE FUNDS THAT WE'RE PROVIDING FOR THE TWO BILLION IN THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION R. ONE TIME FINDS- THAT DON'T DISRUPT OUR ABILITY TO PAY OFF DEFERRAL. FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR THEY'RE DISHING. OFF ON- ON TOP OF THAT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- AND THEN ONE OTHER QUESTIONS IS THIS PLANET AND THIS IS PROBABLY FOR THE- NOT SURE IF WELL WE ASK. THIS IS THIS HOW DOES THIS APPLY THIS BILL APPLY TO SCHOOLS THAT ARE CURRENTLY OPEN. CAROL HAD THAT QUESTION AND IF YOU NEED MORE DETAIL I CAN TURN IT OVER TO- JESSICA HOME- SO THERE ARE THE EXISTING AGREEMENTS THAT ARE IN PLACE FOR SCHOOLS THAT ARE ALREADY OPEN ARE GRANDFATHERED IN AND SO FOR EXAMPLE IF A SCHOOL IS ALREADY OPEN- AND THEY HAPPEN TO BE IN A COUNTY THAT THE PURPLE TEAR. THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO ADHERE TO THE- TESTING CADENCE THAT'S REQUIRED UNDER THAT PURPLE HERE HONEY HELP- REQUIREMENTS- AND- YOU KNOW AGREEMENTS THAT ARE THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE WILL BE. WILL BE MAINTAINED SO NOT MUCH AND IN REGARDS TO CHANGES WILL OCCUR TO THOSE SCHOOLS THAT I'VE ALREADY- BEEN OPEN AND I THINK THAT SENATOR MAN HAD A SIMILAR QUESTION- AND JUST WE JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT. THIS IS THE DO NOT HARM THAT THOSE SCHOOLS THAT ARE ARE ARE ALREADY OPEN- AND REMAINS- UNTOUCHED BY BY THE SPA PACKAGE. OKAY AND THEN. CALLED ME UP WITH THAT AND- ONCE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS MADE THEIR PLAN. THEIR STATE PLAN. TO THE STATE. WHO ACTUALLY GIVES THE APPROVAL FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO RE OPEN IS THAT COME FROM THE COUNTY OR FROM THE STATE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO PURSUE THE OPENING. SURE I'M IN- IN REGARDS TO AGAIN PURPLE PURPLE TEAR. IN THE COUNT IF A SCHOOL DISTRICT OUR SCHOOL- SUBMITS THEIR SAFETY PLAN TO BOTH. THREE MONTHS IN ADVANCE TO THEIR LOCAL- PUBLIC HEALTH- OFFICE AS WELL AS TO THE STATE. AND THAT THE STATE- THEY BOTH ACTUALLY- REVIEWING IT THEY IT TAKES ABOUT. FIVE DAYS AND ON THAT SIX STATES IT'S BEEN APPROVED THEN THEY MAY REOPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION SIR APPROVED BY THE STATE OR APPROVED BY THE COUNTY OR BOTH- I BELIEVE IT'S BOTH. BUT THE COUNTY THE STATE. SO BOTH HAVE TO BE ANGRY TO. OPEN OUR APPROVED THE PLANS BEFORE OPENING. YES AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT- THE STATE- ALONG WITH COUNTIES HAVE BEEN IN- MANY DISCUSSIONS AND- THROUGHOUT THIS WAS SEVERAL MONTHS SO THIS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE ANY NEW INFORMATION BUT THERE'D BE A LOT OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE LOCAL AND STATE. JURISDICTIONS OKAY. AND THEN I'M GOING BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST AS A FOLLOW UP QUESTION. ON THE DEFERRALS- IS IT FAIR M. IS THIS THE IS SIX POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS PARTIALLY FUNDED WITH THE CURRENT DEFERRAL. I'M IN THE HOME- AT ALL REFER THAT QUESTION DID NOT MISS HOLMES. CERTAINLY SO I THINK I THINK WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS THE THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR DEFERRAL FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND- TWENTY TWENTY Q. SCHOOL YEAR- AND WHILE AND PIZZA AND THE SIX POINT SIX BILLION- COULD BE USED TO PAY DOWN THAT DEFERRAL IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YEAR- THOSE FUNDS WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE ON AN ONGOING BASIS. HE COVER THE COST AS THE DEFERRAL INTO FUTURE YEARS- IT'S AN ONGOING DEFERRAL. AND YOUR ONE TIME SIGN. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IN SENATOR LAYERED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR OF WHAT I THOUGHT I COULD DO HIS- SPEAK AND TRY TO TIE TOGETHER A LITTLE A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD IN THIS DEBATE BECAUSE THE DISTRICTS THAT WE ALL REPRESENT ARE VERY DIFFERENT SENATOR NIELSEN IS VERY LUCKY TO HAVE MOST OF THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE THE LOWEST CASE RIGHT IN THE STATE AND AS WE HEARD FROM SENATOR GARAGE SO- SHE HAS AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLY IMPACTED WITH CASES. IN A WAY THAT THERE'S A BIG CONCERN ABOUT COMING BACK IN IN MY OWN DISTRICT I HAVE BOTH I HAVE THE ABSOLUTE COASTAL AREAS WHERE PEOPLE REALLY THINK THAT IT'S EASY TO COME BACK IN THE CASES ARE LOWER AND THE MORE AWAY FROM THE COAST AGRICULTURAL AREAS WHERE THERE'S INTERGENERATIONAL FAMILIES AND MUCH MORE DIVERSITY AND THEY HAVE MANY MORE CONCERNS ABOUT COMING BACK SO THE REAL QUESTION IS HOW IN ONE BILL DO WE ADDRESS ALL THIS. AND SENATOR GROVE. A MADE THE POINT THAT SHE REALLY WANTED CONSISTENT STANDARDS. AND THERE ARE CONSISTENT. WITH THE CONSISTENT STANDARDS ARE ABOUT FLEXIBILITY SO THAT YOU CAN ADDRESS THOSE DIFFERENT CASES. AND JUST TAKE FOR EXAMPLE OCCURS IN A MOMENT I'LL TALK ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE THAT. THAT A SENATOR PAN MENTIONED BUT LET'S JUST SAY. YOU HAVE A CLASS ROOM WHERE UNDER THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE. YOU CANNOT HAVE FULL ATTENDANCE IN ONE ROOM DUE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF KIDS THAT ARE IN THAT CLASS. AND SO IN THAT CASE. WE WANT TO GIVE THE FLEXIBILITY SO THAT IF HALF THE KIDS CAN BE THERE ONE TIME. AND THE OTHER HALF CAN BE DISTANCE LEARNING AND HALFWAY THROUGH THE WEEK THEY SWITCH. THAT GIVES THE DISTRICT THE FLEXIBILITY TO BRING HIM BACK IN THE MAXIMUM POSSIBLE WAY AGAINST THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE. AND SO THERE NEEDS TO BE THAT KIND OF FLEXIBILITY SO PEOPLE CAN PUSH AS FAR AS THEY CAN WITHIN THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE TO DO IT. AND I THINK THAT THERE BEEN QUESTIONS RAISED. ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH AND- L. A. TIMES HAD AN OP ED THAT I DON'T THINK WAS EXACTLY ON THE MARK. BECAUSE THEY IMPLIED THAT IT WAS NOT. THIS BILL IN FRONT OF US WAS NOT SCIENCE BASED. IN FACT IT DOES NOT LEGISLATE THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE BUT IT REQUIRES THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE AND LET THE PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS DECIDE WHAT THE GUIDANCE IS. THERE WAS DEBT EQUAL. INFERENCE IN THAT EDITORIAL. THAT THIS BILL RICK. VAX BEFORE TEACH CAN BACK TO SCHOOL. AND IT DOES NOT IT FOLLOWS WHAT THE CDC'S SCIENCE BASED GUIDANCE IS WHICH IS NOT REQUIRED VACCINATIONS FOR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES BUT STRONGLY RECOMMEND THEM THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES SO IT'S BASED ON SCIENCE AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE CDC. AND PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS SAID HE WISHES TO PRIORITIZE TEACHERS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES AS WELL. SO IT IS VERY CONSISTENT WITH THE FACT. A. N. ADDITIONALLY. THE EVERY DISTRICT IS NOT THE SAME SO IT'S A QUESTION OF HOW YOU ADDRESS THE NEEDS IN THOSE DISTRICTS AND- AND I THINK WHAT SENATOR NIELSEN SOMEBODY BROUGHT UP CHARTER SCHOOLS IT AND THE ANSWER SHOWED EXACTLY THAT FLEXIBILITY. THAT IF THEY WERE A DISTANCE LEARNING ALL THE WAY ALONG. WE'RE NOT GOING TO PAY THEM TO RE OPEN BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN RE OPENED DOING DISTANCE LEARNING ALL THE WAY ALONG. THE REAL QUESTION IS IF THEY WERE DOING IN PERSON WHAT INCENSE OR SUPPORTS THEM TO COME BACK IN PERSON. AND THE REAL CHANGE THAT HAS HAPPENED DURING THE COUPLE OF MONTHS. THIS IS BEEN MORE INTENSELY DISCUSSED. IS A CHANGE IN THE PANDEMIC. BECAUSE THE TIME GOVERNOR CRAFTED A PUBLIC PROPOSAL. IT WAS BASICALLY TO TRY TO PUSH SCHOOLS TO OPEN. BECAUSE OF MOST COUNTIES WERE PURPLE NOT MOVING TOWARD THE RED END THERE NEEDED TO BE INCENTIVES TO DO THAT. AND IN THE COURSE OF THAT DISCUSSION. COUNTY CASE LOADS OF DROPPED MANY ARE ON THE VERGE OF DROPPING INTO THE RED. SO PART OF THIS SAYS THEY'LL STILL BE A POLISH WITH MONEY AND INCENTIVES TO OPEN. BUT TWO THIRDS OF IT OF THE MONEY SAYS WILL ACTUALLY HELP PEOPLE RE OPEN BECAUSE THEY'RE HEADED IN THE RIGHT WAY IN THE PANDEMIC AND THEY NEED THE HELP. TO RE OPEN. IN A AND I THINK SENATOR DRAWS OR RAISED A VERY IMPORTANT POINT. WHICH IS IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S NOT SAFE. OR YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE BEEN DISADVANTAGED TO THERE'S A HIGH CASELOAD. WHAT'S THE ASSURANCE FOR SAFETY WHAT'S THE ASSURANCE THAT DISADVANTAGED DISTRICTS WILL NOT BE LEFT BEHIND. WARNER RIGHT HERE IT'S THAT IN THOSE HEAVY CASELOAD LEVELS THAT'S WHERE THE TESTING WILL BE THAT'S WHERE THE TESTING. CAN BE PAID FOR BY THE MONEY. THAT THE THAT'S WHERE IT ALL HAPPENED AND ADDITIONALLY THAT'S WHY PRIORITIZING THOSE THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND BY DISTANCE LEARNING FIRST BY MAKING SURE. IF THEY WERE FOSTER KIDS FOR HOMELESS KIDS OR AT THE RISK OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT AS WAS RAISED. FOR PEOPLE THAT JUST DIDN'T THE KIDS IT JUST DIDN'T ATTEND. FOR THOSE THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE TECHNOLOGICAL ABILITY TO DO DISTRICTS WARNING OR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS MAKE SURE THAT THEY THE ONES THAT FIRST DROPPED OUT. OR THE ONES PRIORITIZED TO HAVE WE COME BACK IN SO IT SPEAKS TO THE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IN A VERY VERY STRONG ONE. AND ANOTHER THING THAT WAS SAID. IS THERE WAS AN EMPTY. THAT REALLY THIS WAS A BILL THAT CATERED TO ONE PARTICULAR GROUP. WELL IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR SAID WE'RE VERY CONCERNED SAYS THIS DEBATE WAS STARTED. AND SOME OF THEM CAME UP IN THE DEBATE THEY SAID WE- DON'T WANT TO BE PENALIZED IF WE'VE ALREADY BEEN OPENED. THAT'S IN THIS BILL SO THEY'RE NOT. IT'S SORT OF LIKE IF WE WERE TESTING WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL AND DO A WHOLE NEW CADENCE THIS ALLOWS FOR FLEXIBLE PROCESS FOR THEM NOT TO BE PENALIZED. AND HAVE THAT PRE EXISTING TESTING DONE. IF THEY DID A COVERT PLAN ALREADY IT REALLY SAYS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO REDO IT IT INTO I THINK IT WAS SANDRA CHOI BUGS ARE CONCERNED. THAT THESE HAVE TO BE APPROVED THERE'S ACTUALLY A TIME LIMIT ON THEIR APPROVAL IN THIS BILL SO THAT IF THEY'RE NOT ACTED ON BY THE ADMINISTRATORS IT AUTOMATICALLY IS APPROVED SO THAT. THAT WILL NOT BOGGED DOWN THE PROCESS AND INITIALLY THERE WAS A PROPOSAL. THAT EVERY DISTRICT HAD TO APPLY. S. AND THIS NO. EVERY DISTRICT. IS IN A WAY THAT THAT THAT DOESN'T PUT ANOTHER BARRIER IN THE WAY. OF RE OPENING AND SO AN ADDITIONAL IN A SPEECH TO SENATOR DRAWS CONCERN. ORIGINALLY FROM THE MONEY THE WHOLE SIX POINT SIX BILLION IN THE FIRST DISCUSSIONS OF THIS. WOULD ONLY GO TO THOSE THAT WE OPEN EARLY. AND YET THAT WAS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFLUENT DISTRICTS AND THOSE THAT WERE BEHIND IN LINE WITH DISPROPORTIONATELY DISADVANTAGED DISTRICTS. AND IN THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS THIS REMOVES THAT. AND IN THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS REALLY TO OPEN SAT PEOPLE TO OPEN. IF THEY CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE PARENTS DON'T WANT TO SEND THEIR KIDS BACK OR THE PURPLE LEVEL WAS TOO HIGH. THEN 10% OF THE OTHER MONEY CAN BE USED TO HELP THEM RE OPEN IF THEY RE OPEN. LATELY SO THAT FLEXIBILITY. IS THERE SO RE. THIS WAS HARD AND IT IS HARD BECAUSE WE NEED TO ADDRESS ALL THE KIDS IN THE FALL THE OVER ONE THOUSAND DISTRICTS THAT ARE IN THE STATE AND WE HAVE TO TRY TO EXPEDITE THE RE OPENING BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL SAFE WHETHER THEY'RE THE TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM OR THE PARENTS THEY'RE SENDING THEIR KIDS BACK AND I THINK THAT'S THE BALANCE WE TRIED TO STRIKE IN THIS. SO I FEEL LIKE. THIS WAS HARD FOR A REASON AND YOU CAN JUST GET IT BY THE WAY I'M TALKING ABOUT IT. OVER A THOUSAND DISTRICTS PEOPLE WITH HIGH CASELOADS PEOPLE WITH LOW CASELOADS PEOPLE THAT WANT THEIR KIDS BACK RIGHT NOW. PEOPLE THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HEALTH OF PUTTING THEIR KIDS BACK. TEACHERS DON'T WANT TO KNOW IF THEY'RE GOING BACK IN THE PURPLE OF. HERE THAT THEY ACCESS TO PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES TO PROTECT THEM IN THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY. AND I THINK THIS IS GOOD THERE'S A REASON WHY. IS IT THAT THEY'RE SORT OF PEOPLE AT THE STRONG HANDS OF BOTH ENDS OF THIS. THEY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL. THERE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE CONCERNED THAT WE ARE NOT. ADDRESSING INEQUITIES AND THOSE THAT ARE ALWAYS CONCERNED THAT WE'RE NOT PUSHING HARD ENOUGH AND YET WE HAD TO HAVE A BILL.

AND QUERY FINANCE IT LOOKS LIKE THEY PULL FIRST WOULD BE THE EARLIEST THESE SCHOOLS COULD BE OPENING. ELEMENT FORM DIET THAT THAT DURING SPRING BREAK. IN FACT GOOD FRIDAY IS APRIL SECOND. DO THOSE DATES NEED TO BE THAT CHANGED RELIGION ARE A BIT OF A CONFLICT THERE COULD FINANCE AS OF THAT DATE QUESTION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT- YES ACTUALLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND I'M I'M I'M NOT pDISTRICTS- SPRING BREAK AND SO I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT SENATOR NELSON. IF YOU WOULD I THINK THAT THERE COULD BE SOME POTENTIAL CONFLICT AND DIFFICULTIES WITH THESE DATES BECAUSE PROBABLY THE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS DO INDEED HAVE DIFFERENT. BACK TO SCHOOL DATES FOR SPRING BREAK DATES SO PLEASE DO CHECK ON THAT. I THANK YOU ALL RIGHT- BEFORE. I ENTERTAIN A MOTION WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT MYSELF AND THEN I WANT TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION- AND I WILL CALL ON SENATOR LAYERED FOR THE MOTION- I WANT TO. REALLY GIVE MY APPRECIATION TO THE STAFF THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS LITERALLY SINCE DECEMBER AND THOSE ARE STAFF IN BOTH HOUSES- AND- MANY OFFICES AND OF COURSE IN WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION ADDITIONALLY AND OF COURSE MANY MANY MEMBERS HAVE ALSO. BEEN SPENDING MANY HOURS ON THIS AS WELL AS STAKEHOLDERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND THERE WERE VARIOUS REFERENCES IN THIS DEBATE TO CERTAIN STAKEHOLDER SOMEHOW GETTING MORE THAN OTHERS AND- I STRONGLY DISAGREE WITH THAT ASSERTION. THIS IS HARD AS SENATOR LAYERED POINTED OUT. THE DETAILS MATTER. AS MUCH AS THERE ARE VERY LEGITIMATE REASONS TO GET OUR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL SOME FAST AS POSSIBLE. IN MANY PARENTS WHO WANT THAT THERE ARE ALSO MANY PARENTS WHO ARE AFRAID AND ARE CONCERNED TO HAVE THEIR CHILD GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND POTENTIALLY BRING THE VIRUS BACK INTO THEIR HOMES AND PUT SUCH SOMEONE IN THEIR FAMILY AT RISK. AND WHILE WE HAVE MANY OTHER WORKERS WHO ARE HAVE IN EFFECT NO CHOICE ECONOMICALLY BUT TO GO TO WORK C. WAREHOUSE WORKERS AND OTHERS. MANY OF THEM ARE ALSO IN FEAR EVERY DAY OF BRINGING THE VIRUS HOME. BEYOND WHAT WE NEEDED TO DO WAS STRIKE A BALANCE THAT GOT OUR KIDS BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM BUT ABSOLUTELY MINIMIZE THAT RISK. BY BRINGING THAT BUYERS HOME WEATHER HOME TO THE CHURCH STUDENTS FAMILY TO THE STAFF'S FAMILY OR TO THE TEACHER'S FAMILY WHICH OF COURSE WOULD EXACERBATES BACK COMMUNITY SPREAD. AND MANY OF US HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING GERMANY AND- I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH- THE- THE SCIENCE BASED RESPONSE THAT THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT AND DIFFERENT LEVELS AT ALL THROUGH ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT HAVE HAD THE- BASICALLY THE HIGHER AMOUNT OF IT HERE IT'S SOCIALLY TO BE MASK WEARING INTO OTHER PROTOCOLS AND YET. GERMANY ITSELF ONLY RE OPENED THEIR SCHOOLS THIS WEEK. THEY ALSO HAVE BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SPREAD AND SO I THINK THAT WE NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WANTS TO GET CODE NINETEEN NO ONE. AND I THINK WHAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED HERE. AND IT TOOK A LONG TIME BECAUSE IT WAS. DIFFICULT TO WORK OUT SOMETHING THAT REALLY MET THE NEEDS OF ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS SO WITH THAT LET ME CALL ON SENATOR LAYERED I MOVE THE BILL. SO WE HAVE A MOTION. SEEING THAT DEBATE IS CONCLUDED. LET US CALL THE RULE. AB EIGHTY SIX THE MOTION IS TO PASS SENATOR SKINNER. BY SKINNER I NIELSEN. NIELSEN I COPY AERO COPYRIGHT I CORTESE CORTESE I DOLLY. KALIAN BERADA. TORONTO II AIKMAN.
