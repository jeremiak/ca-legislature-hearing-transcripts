AND THANKS STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF -- TO INCLUDE AND EXPAND THIS TO INCLUDE MEDICARE'S -- SO WE'RE HAPPY TO DO THAT AND TAKE THE THE CHAIRS -- AMENDMENTS SENATE BILL SIX CENTER WILL MAKE CLEAR WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT THE STANDARD FERTILITY PRESERVATION SERVICES WHEN A MEDICALLY NECESSARY TREATMENT MAY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. CAUSE INFERTILITY ARE COVERED ARE COVERED BENEFIT BECAUSE THE LAW DOES NOT EXPLICITLY SPELL OUT EACH AND EVERY COVERED SERVICE THERE'S CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT FERTILITY PRESERVATION IS. MANY PATIENTS HAVE BEEN DENIED COVERAGE DESPITE THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE REPEATEDLY CONSISTENCY OVERTURNING HEALTH PLAN DENIALS OF COVERAGE FOR FERTILITY PRESERVATION THESE WRONGFUL DELAYS IN THE NILES CONTINUE. TO REGULARLY RECORDS COVERAGE WITH PROMPT APPROVALS FOR CARRIAGE COULD CALL FOR ACCESS NO FRANKLY NO ONE SHOULD BE A SHOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN. GETTING TREATMENT FOR CANCER AND LOSING THEIR FERTILITY -- WE THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT -- WE'VE TRIED OBVIOUSLY TRIED THIS BEFORE AND I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR WORKING WITH MIKE -- STAFF AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I HAVE A FEW WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OKAY THANK YOU SIX MINUTES ONLY. WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON GERMANIC MANY MEMBERS HI MITCH ROSEN A REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINOLOGIST AT UCSF AND DIRECTOR OF OUR FERTILITY PRESERVATION PROGRAM. I WORK WITH PATIENTS ON ALMOST A DAILY BASIS WHO ARE FACING TREATMENT. FACING IMMINENT MEDICAL TREATMENT WHO COULD SAVE THEIR LIVES BUT OFTEN AT THE COST OF THEIR FERTILITY. THESE PATIENTS ARE GENERALLY IN SHOCK AND OVERWHELMED BY THEIR SERIOUS DIAGNOSIS. THEY HAVE TO MAKE COMPLEX MEDICAL DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR CANCER TREATMENT. AND THENON TOP OF THAT THEY MUST QUICKLY DECIDE IF THEY MAY ARE THEY MIGHT WANT TO HAVE CHILDREN SOME DAY. IF THEY DO THEY MUST TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO PRESERVE THEIR FERTILITY. ADVOCATES SUCH AS SHOWS ON A KEY OF THE ALLIANCE FOR TELL PRESERVATIO SITTING WITH US TODAY. HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE TO OBTAIN COVERAGE FOR INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS ALL INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEWS FOR CANCER PATIENTS HAVE OVERTURNED. YET WE CONTINUE TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT DELAYS AND I'LL WRITE THE NILES FOR THIS MEDICAL NECESSARY TREATMENT. DESPITE OUR CLINICAL SO OUR CLINICS BEST EFFORTS TO OBTAIN COVERAGE WE USUALLY ARE UNABLE TO GET CLEAR DECISIONS IN TIME. TO ALLOW THE PATIENTS TO UNDERGO AN PRETTILY PRESERVATION PROCEDURES PRIOR TO THE START OF THEIR CANCER TREATMENT. WHY IS THIS HERE SO IMPORTANT RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN MANY PATIENTS ARE SO COMPARTE SO CONCERNED ABOUT FUTURE PARENTHOOD? THAT THEY MAY NOT CHOOSE THE RECOMMENDED THERAPIES THERE IS EVIDENCE FOR EXAMPLE THAT SUGGESTED ABOUT ONE THIRD OF PRE MENOPAUSAL BREAST CANCER PATIENTS DON'T INITIATE OR WILL STOP THEIR TAMOXIFEN EARLY. DUE TO FERTILITY CONCERNS WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE COVERAGE FOR FERTILITY PRESERVATION. SO WHILE WE HAVE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME THAT PATIENTS LEFT INFERTILE FROM CANCER TREATMENT SCORE WORSE I MEASURES OF QUALITY OF LIFE AND UNRESOLVED DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY WE NOW UNDERSTAND THAT THIS ISSUE. CAN EVEN COMPROMISED THEIR MEDICAL TREATMENT AND LEAD TO WORSE OUTCOMES. SB SIX HUNDRED WILL CLEAR FIVE EXISTENCE OF COVERAGE FOR MEDICAL NECESSARY FERTILITY PRESERVATION. SET THE TIMELY TREATMENT CAN BE OBTAINED. THANK YOU AND ON BEHALF OF UCSF SRM MY PATIENTS AND MYSELF I ASK FOR YOUR RIVALS. GOOD AFTERNOON SHANNON SMITH CALLING ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE WAS CO SPONSORS OF BILL WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR YEARS SO I'M HERE FOR QUESTIONS. HI AM CHOICE REINECKE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ALLIANCE FOR FERTILITY PRESERVATION AND WE ALSO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR SEVERAL YEARS -- AND JOIN TOGETHER TO TRY TO HELP PATIENTS GET THIS COVERAGE IN TIME -- BECAUSE IT'S IRREVERSIBLE AND WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES REPORT NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION. MIKE MIKE FROM PLEASE. TURN. IT ON TURN MEMBERS ALTAMONT IN SMITH WITH THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY CANCER ACTION NETWORK ALSO IN SUPPORT. I ALWAYS A CALL WITH CALIFORNIA CHRONIC CARE COALITION SUPPORT. OKAY A SCENE OTHER WITNESSES AT THE MICROPHONE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME UP. ACTUALLY YOU CAN PLEASE MAKE SOME ROOM FOR THE OPPOSITION IN FRONT. RIGHT AWAY AROUND. THIRTY SIX MINUTES MAX. MAX I THINK I'LL BE SHORTER THAN THAT GOOD AFTERNOON I'M GENERALLY WHAT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS -- AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TO HEAR OUR CONCERNS WITH THIS BILL -- YOU KNOW CAP MUST OPPOSE THIS BILL WE VIEW IT AS A BENEFIT MANDATE AT WHICH WILL INCREASE CONSUMER PREMIUMS -- ALWAYS SYMPATHIZE WITH THE ISSUE FEDERAL AND STATE LAW CURRENTLY DEFINED HOUSE STATES COVER BENEFITS UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT -- STATES REQUIRED TO SLUDGE SELECT A BENCHMARK PLAN THAT DEFINES HEALTH RELATED SERVICES AND EQUIPMENT REFER TO IS THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS -- SEVERAL BENEFIT MANDATES HAVE BEEN PROPOSED THIS YEAR AND IN AND IN THE LEGISLATURE AND REACHED RECENT YEARS AT EVERY TURN -- OUR MEMBERS REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF BENEFIT MANDATES ON PREMIUMS PARTICULARS WE FACE AN INHERENT PRESSURES IN AN INVOLVING MARKET -- YOU KNOW THE TOTALITY OFTHE MANDATES BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR EQUAL SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS -- AND SO YOU KNOW THE COST OF THE MONTHLY PREMIUM IS A PRIMARY CONSIDERATIONS FOR CONSUMERS WHEN THEY'RE SELECTING A PLAN. I'M IN THE SO FAR CALIFORNIA'S ON A MUCH BETTER JOB IT COMPARED TO MOST OTHER STATES IN KEEPING COVERAGE AFFORDABLE -- BUT WE STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT AFFORDABILITY -- AND WE FEEL THAT IT'S YOU KNOW IMPERATIVE TO KEEP -- KEEP THE COST OF CARE. LOW. SO A COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS CONSUMER PRICE SENSITIVITY AND EXCEEDING. YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY EXCEEDING THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS MAKE IT A PART PARTICULARLY BAD TIME TO PASS NEW BENEFIT MANDATES. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. SEVENTY RECKONS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WE TOO ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL I THINK EVERYONE AT THIS TABLE AND IN THIS ROOM HEART GOES OUT TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM CANCER OTHER DISEASES THAT MAY CAUSE INFERTILITY. UNFORTUNATELY WE DO HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS WOULD GO BEYOND CANCER PATIENTS AND INCLUDE OTHER INSTANCES FOR WHICH THEY WOULD BE SEEKING TREATMENT. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE LENGTH OF COVERAGE ENERGY BURKE TALKED ABOUT A ONE YEAR OF STORAGE WE CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S PROBABLY A REALISTIC. EXPECTATION SO WE WOULD HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO ABANDON EMBRYOS WHAT WOULD BE THE LENGTH OF SERVICE AND THE GENERAL COST. NEXT TIME WHEN CALIFORNIA'S LOOKING AN IMPOSING AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE ALONG WITH SUBSIDIES TO ASSIST PEOPLE IN ACCESSING CARE WE THINK WE NEED TO BE EXCEPTIONALLY PRICE SENSITIVE TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS LOOKING TO PURCHASE COVERAGE. FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IN THE BACK FROM. HEARING SARKISIAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WHERE OPPOSED DUE TO THE INCREASED HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS FOR EMPLOYERS AND AND RELEASE ALL RIGHT NEED NAME. LARGE ASIAN POSITION JOHN WHEN YOU'RE ON THE F. AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS ECHO THE SAME COMMENTS CAPITA CLICK. THANK YOU. OKAY SEE NO OTHER WITNESSES. THE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER PORTANTINO FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD -- I TO HAVE A PASSION AND HEART FOR INDIVIDUALS GETTING CANCER TREATMENT AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF IF IT IS GOING TO RESULT IN INFERTILITY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S THAT THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AND CHILD VERY NEEDS TO BE ABLE STORE THEIR EMBRYOS. I DO HAVE TWO QUESTIONS ONE THE WAY READ THE BILL IT MAKES IT SOUND LIKE WHAT YOU ARE PROPOSING IS ALREADY IN LAWYERS CLEAR FINER CODIFYING IT I COULDN'T FIND THAT IN THE STATUTE CAN YOU DIRECT ME TO WHERE THAT IS. OR CAN SOMEONE SORRY. AND ACTUALLY THAT'S THE GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT OUR FRUSTRATION IS -- EVERY APPEAL HAS BEEN OVERTURNED AND SO WHY NOT MAKE IT CLEAR SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO SO SHOULD GENERAL GIVE YOU THE ACTUAL. CYLINDER THE KNOX KEEN ACT IT'S A BROAD UMBRELLA OF MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICES FOR INSTANCE. IF YOU LOOK FOR AN APPENDECTOMY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND IT. AND SO WHAT YOU WILL FIND OFTEN IS IF YOU LOOKING EVIDENCES OF COVERAGE WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS INFERTILITY. AND INFERTILITY IS MOST OFTEN NOT COVERED. SO THERE'S A BEEN A CONFUSION ABOUT FERTILITY PRESERVATION UNDERSTANDABLY MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THE PROVISION. AND FERTILITY PRESERVATION AND JUST TO BACK UP THE DAMAGE THE JUST ISSUED A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER. AGAINST ONE OF THE PLANS IS FEELING TO PAY. OKAY. SO THEY ARE CONVINCED IT IS COVERED BENEFIT OKAY I'M GLAD I MEAN I'M NOT SAYING I'M GLAD YOU CAN FIND BECAUSE I CAN FIND IT AND AND MY STAFF CAN FIND I APPRECIATE STAFF. IS THERE CAN I AM CAN HEALTH PLANS RESPOND PLEASE IF -- YOU KNOW MY MEMBERS ARE FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NO STATUTE REQUIRING THIS COVERAGE THERE'S BEEN NO REGULATIONS ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HAND MANAGED HEALTHCARE. REGARDING THIS COVERAGE AND A BILL IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN WAS VETO THAT WAS. EIGHTY NINE TWELVE AND THE VETO MESSAGE MESSAGE READS WHY I UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE TO PRESERVE FERTILITY WHERE POSSIBLE SUCH COVERAGE WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED. A FOR INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE AND SMALL GROUP COVERAGE. AND SO I MEAN THAT'S THANK YOU. THAT'S THE THE CLARITY THAT I HAVE FOR MY MEMBERS THANK YOU AGAIN AND AT SENATOR MY SECOND QUESTION IS IT -- HIM FOR LIFE NOT GONNA. SAM NINE TO BED -- I GUESS YOU GATHER HARVEST FIFTEEN EMBRYOS YEAH. YOU ONLY NEED ONE OR TWO WHAT HAPPENS TO THE REST OF THEM IS THERE SOME KIND OF MECHANISM FOR I THINK THOSE SOLAR I I THINK IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND WHAT THE ADVANCES IN FERTILITY. HARVESTING EGGS IS BECOME JUST A SUCCESSFUL -- AND SO MORE AND MORE FERTILITY EFFORTS ARE ARE ARE EIGHT BASED AS OPPOSED TO EMBRYO BASED MENU IF YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO THAT. AND THE FIRST THE STE YOU CAN ALSO CLARIFY THE OTHER ISSUES AS WELL. ONLY A DOCTOR ROSEN'S BRING TO THE THE OVERSIGHT HARVESTING AND AND THE EMBRYOS BUT ONE OF THE THINGS. ON THE TO SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO THE MANDATE WE WERE LOOKING TO ADD THIS AS COVERAGE BECAUSE IT WAS NOT YET THE STANDARD OF CARE. AND THAT'S WHEN WE WERE LOOKING IN PREVIOUS BILLS TO ADD IS A MANDATE. IN THE INTERIM IT HAS BECOME THE STANDARD OF CARE WE WERE THINKING ABOUT DOING ANOTHER BILL ACTUALLY MEANT THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HE SAID WELL NOW THAT IT IS THE STANDARD OF CARE IT MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR BEING MEDICALLY NECESSARY. AND YOU DO NOT NEED A SPECIFIC STATUTE. THAT'S ACTUALLY WITH SB ONE SEVENTY TWO TWO YEARS AGO WE ACTUALLY STE. PAUSE TO THE BILL BECAUSE WE DIDN'T THINK WE NEEDED IT WE JUST IN PARTICULARLY MS ROENICKE WORKED ON VERY HARD WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE. TO HAND WALK THESE PATIENTS THROUGH THE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW PROCESS AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE CANCER PATIENTS. THEIR DENIAL WAS OVERTURNED BUT THE ONLY PATIENTS WHO COULD GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS WERE THOSE WHO WERE ABLE TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES UP FRONT. AND GET REIMBURSED BECAUSE THIS COULD TAKE WEEKS OR MONTHS TO GET RESOLVED AND SOMEBODY MIGHT LITERALLY HAVE. A WEEK OR TWO TO GET. SERVICES SO IN IN IN IS TO THE THE A GOOD EMBRYO QUESTION YOU KNOW YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE STANDARD OF CARE. THANK YOU. SO REALLY QUICKLY -- SO. LET'S OVER TEN YEARS AGO ECHO PRESERVATION WASN'T REALLY ESTABLISH KERR SO AS WE WERE IT WAS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL PHASE. AND THEN IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IT BECAME MORE OF US IT BECAME MORE OF A STANDARD CARE ESTABLISH AND NOW IT'S AT A POINT WHERE. HAS EQUAL SUCCESS TWO EMBRYOS SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE STANDARD OF CARE. EXEMPTION OR THE THE INCLUSION WASN'T INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL NEGOTIATED LANGUAGE AT THAT WE DID IT. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE OR THIRTEEN WHAT I'M WHAT I'M SAYING IS I'M NOT ABOUT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE LANGUAGE THERE I'M JUST SAYING AS FAR AS PART OF THAT. THE IN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY HOW WE TREAT PATIENTS BECAUSE YOU HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT EMBRYOS AND YES THEY WANTED TO AMBER IN ONLY NEEDING LET'S SAY WANTED TO EMBRACE WHAT WOULD WE DO WITH THE REST OF THOSE EMBRYOS. THE WHERE THE TREND IS AT THIS POINT IS MOSTLY TO FREEZE AXE OKAY NOT EMBRYOS BRITAIN SO -- THERE WE DO STILL DO THAT ON OCCASION BUT THERE ARE -- IT'S DEFINITELY THE TENDENCY IS FOR X. TWO X. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SENATOR PORTANTINO AND IF I COULD ADD ACTUALLY CHAIR -- THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WERE HERE'S ON THE ORIGINAL. LAWS WERE CREATED WE DIDN'T HAVE THE ADVANCEMENTS INFERTILITY THAT WE DO TODAY SO. ACTUALLY SORRY TO INTERRUPT BUT I SEE THE TENT THAT PRESENCE OF A QUORUM AND I WOULD LIKE TO CALL THE ROLL. SECOND PLEASE CALL THE ROLL CAN. CAN HEAR STONE. STONE HERE DOURADO GROVE. GROWTH HERE HER TADO LEYVA MITCHELL. THE BILL HERE MITCHELL HERE. MORNING MORNING HERE RUBIO. WE HAVE A QUORUM THANK YOU. BUT WITH THE I'D SO THERE'S A MOTION ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY SEEING NONE. SIR PORTANTINO I MEAN IT'S PRETTY SHEET TO YOU CARRYING THIS BILL TO BE SURE THAT -- THAT WE CONTINUE TO ALLOW THESE PATIENTS TO BE ABLE -- TO TO TO BASICALLY HAVE YOU KNOW HAVE THE OPTION -- FOR FOR HAVING CHILDREN AND THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR STONE WHICH LIKE CLOTHES. WE ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE THANKS VERY MUCH -- SO AGAIN THE MOTIONS TO PASS THE MANTA APPROPRIATIONS [inaudible] FOR NEIL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- PRESENTING -- SB SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT WHICH WILL REQUIRE -- HOSPITALS THAT HAVE A BUILDING THAT IS NOT COMPLIANT WITH THE JANUARY ONE TWENTY THIRTY SEISMIC SAFETY STANDARD. TO REPORT TO THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT WHAT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN EACH BUILDING OF THAT HOSPITAL I'LL BE BRIEF TODAY AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I THINK THERE'S A FEW PEOPLE HERE -- WITH SOME OTHER IT BILLS AND I DON'T WANT TO TAKE TOO MUCH TIME BUT OUR HOSPITALS ARE SPEND BILLIONS TO MEET CURRENT SEISMIC REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THE BUILDINGS WILL NOT COLLAPSE. THE MAJOR EARTHQUAKE PROTECTING PATIENTS EMPLOYEES AND FAMILIES AS OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO ALL OF OUR HOSPITALS WILL MEET THIS REQUIREMENT HOSPITALS MUST NOW TURN TO THE TWENTY THIRTY REQUIREMENT WHICH REQUIRES THEM. TO ENSURE THEY WERE IN TIRES FACILITY IS FULLY OPERATIONAL AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE AND ACCORDING TO A RECENT RAND STUDY THIS WOULD COST HOSPITALS. THIRTY FOUR TO A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS -- WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT COST ESPECIALLY WHEN WE CONSIDER HOW TO CONTROL COST GROWTH IN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS FRANKLY SOMETHING EVERYBODY WANTS TO DO. SB SEVEN FIVE EIGHT CURRENTLY REQUIRES HOSPITALS REPORT THE LOCATION O THEIR SERVICES TO THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT THIS INFORMATION WILL BE HELPFUL AS WE FOCUS ON THE TWENTY THIRTY MANDATE -- WE ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO WILL TESTIFY WITH CONCERNS TO HAVE A CONVERSATION AND I THINK THAT'S THE MAIN -- TAKE AWAY HERE WAS WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION BECAUSE THE DOLLARS ARE SIGNIFICANT THE CLOCK IS TICKING AND WE NEED TO ALL COME TOGETHER AND HAVE A REASONABLE CONVERSATION AND I RESPECT. THAT THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING UP TO NOW AND HOPE IT CONTINUES AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WITNESSES SUPPORT CATHERINE ALSO SCOUT THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION I THINK THE UTHOR SAID IT BEST ALTHOUGH WE WOULD ADD TO THE HOSPITALS ARE COMMITTED. TO PROVIDING CRITICAL SERVICES POST DISASTER I WE ARE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DISCUSS THE REALITY OF THE COSTS RELATED TO THE TWENTY THIRTY MANDATE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUING THAT CONVERSATION. AND THE INTEREST OF TIME I WILL. ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT BACK LIKE FRONT HONEY DELGADO ON BEHALF OF THE DISTRICT HOSPITAL LEADERSHIP FORUM IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU -- SEEN. PEOPLE MICROPHONE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME UP [inaudible] AMONG THE SORRY SORRY. HI WELCOME SIX MINUTES TOTAL TO INTERVIEW. MR TURN MEMBERS AT TAYLOR JACKSON OF THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION CNN HAS A CONCERN POSITION ON SB SEVEN FIVE EIGHT BECAUSE THE BILL IS CURRENTLY IN A WHAT WE BELIEVE IS A SUBSTANTIVE SPOT FORM. IT HAS BEEN MADE CLEAR TO US THE INTENTION OF THIS BILL IS TO MAKE A BROAD ELIMINATION OF HOSPITAL BUILDING SEISMIC SAFETY STANDARDS. THIS IS NOT AN EXTENSION OF TIME LINES BUT AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE AWAY HEALTH CARE FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS AT THE VERY MOMENT THEY'LL NEED IT MOST. RIGHT AFTER A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE JUST KEEPING A HOSPITAL STANDING IS NOT ENOUGH YOUR CONSTITUENTS WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER BABIES HAVE HEART ATTACKS OR STROKES. AND RECEIVE TREATMENT FOR THE LIKELY CRUSH INJURIES A MAJOR SEISMIC EVENT CAUSES DO WE REALLY WANT LOCAL FIREFIGHTERS AND PARAMEDICS TO SPEND THEIR TIME POST DISASTER. MOVING PEOPLE FROM A TWO HUNDRED BED HOSPITAL TO ANOTHER FACILITY TO COUNTIES OVER I WOULD PERSONALLY PREFER THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO FOCUS ON DISASTER VICTIMS AND THE ROLE AS EMERGENCY PERSONNEL. THIS BILL IS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT AND NURTURE THE NURSES ARE TO THIS COMMITTEE TO VOTE NO ON SB SEVEN FIVE EIGHT TODAY. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK MENDOZA WITH THIS YEAR YOU WE ARE ALSO OUT OF CONCERN -- POSITION THE BASIS FOR OUR CONCERNS IS THAT THAT SPONSORED THE BILL THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION HAS INDICATED THEIR INTENTION TO USE THIS. AS A VEHICLE TO ADDRESS THE BROADER QUESTION OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE TWENTY THIRTY SEISMIC. A DEADLINE AS HE ARE YOU BELIEVES IN UPHOLDING THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN PASSING THE TWENTY THIRTY STANDARD WILL ENSURE THAT HOSPITALS ARE NOT. NOT ONLY USING STATE STRUCTURES POST EARTHQUAKE. BUT WHAT THEY ARE USEFUL IN THE PROVISION OF LIFESAVING EMERGENCY AND OTHER -- HEALTH CARE TREATMENT IN THE WAKE OF A MAJOR SITES MAKE OF IN CALIFORNIA. HOSPITALS HAVE HAD TWENTY FIVE YEARS SO FAR TO PLAN FOR COMPLIANCE. THEY HAVE TEN MORE YEARS BEFORE THEY ARE SUBJECT TO THE STANDARD AS HE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA KNOWS THAT WITH EACH YEAR WHILE OUR MEMORIES OF NORTHRIDGE AND SAN FERNANDO FATE. THE POSSIBILITY OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE INCREASE AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSOR MOVING FORWARD TO ENSURE CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO LIFE. SAVING EMERGENCY SERVICES IN THE EVENT OF AN EARTHQUAKE DISASTER IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE MUST EXPRESS OUR CONCERN WITH SB SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT AS IT COMES BEFORE YOU AND COMMITTEE THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THEIR FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE ALSO HAVE THAT CONCERNS POSITION IT WOULD LIKE TO BE INVOLVED IN CONVERSATIONS GOING FORWARD -- AS WE REPRESENT WORKERS IN HOSPITALS AND IN THE BUILDING TRADES WHO WOULD BE PERFORMING THE SEISMIC UPGRADES THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SEEN OTHER -- WITNESSES AT THE MICROPHONE QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MEMBER CENTER STONE THANK YOU MISTER -- SENATOR PORTANTINO I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD TO START THE CONVERSATION -- TWENTY THIRTY IS JUST A SHORT ELEVEN YEARS AWAY AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. NOT BILLIONS BUT HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT MANY SMALL HOSPITAL DISTRICTS DON'T HAVE A SPECIAL SUMMON MY RULE AREAS. AND IF IT'S FULLY IMPLEMENTED AS A LAWS WRITTEN THEY WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS AND THERE WILL BE NO JOBS FOR NURSES ARE WE KNOW PLACES. FOR FOR PATIENTS AGO SO -- WE THIS BILL IS BASICALLY INSTIGATING A CONVERSATION THAT NOBODY IS HAVING ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS A SEISMIC RETROFITTING OF HOSPITALS TO MAKE THEM SAFE. FOR OUR PATIENTS WALL OF THE SAME TIME UNDERSTANDING THE THE ECONOMICS AND FINING NEWER TECHNOLOGIES TO ALLOW US ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS AND COST EFFECTIVE WAYS SO THAT. WE DON'T HAVE A TO A TWENTY FIVE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR DAY CHARGE IN A HOSPITAL BECAUSE WE INVEST ALL OVER MONEY IN A AND RETROFITTING THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE NECESSARY BUT THE CONCERNS ARE WELL TAKEN -- BUT THE STUFF JUST STARTS THE CONVERSATION WE NEED START TALKING ABOUT IT NOW AND I'M DELIGHTED TO TO MOVE YOUR BILL. OKAY ANY OTHER BUT S. CENTER MONEY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD INTO ADDRESS. THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPONENTS SOME. WE DEALT WITH THIS ISSUE WHEN I CHAIREDTHE HEALTH COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY. TO RECURRING CHALLENGE IN A BALANCING ACT OF ON THE ONE HAND PROTECTING THE SAFETY OF PATIENTS AND HOSPITAL WORKERS AS A PRIMARY PRIORITY FOR ALL OF US. AND ON THE OTHER HAND HAVING PATHWAYS TO RETROFITTING IN. SAFETY SEISMIC RETROFITTING. SO THAT WE DON'T TAKE AWAY. AN EMERGENCY ROOM ACCESS IN A RURAL AREA -- THAT COULD LEAD TO LOSS OF LIVES BEFORE THE EARTHQUAKE SO. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. WITH THE OPPONENTS -- ON THEIR CONCERNS WITH THE AUTHOR AS WE MOVE THIS FORWARD AND TRY TO FIND THAT CORRECT BALANCE BUT IN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD IN. I THINK WE HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR STONE. OKAY. A SCENE OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS I JUST WANNA SAY THAT -- FIRST OF ALL -- I IF FOR THE OPPOSITION I HEAR YOUR CONCERNS -- AND CERTAINLY WE DO NOT. THE NOT LOOKING FOR A YOUNG. IT'S A FRAZIER YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THIS IS GONNA BE OVERLY EXPANSIVE AND AND WHAT'S BEEN REALLY THINKING ABOUT -- WHAT HOW DO WE KEEP PATIENTS SAFE DURING A DISASTER AND I? AND BUT I I HAVE NO I HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN CENTER PORTANTINO IN TERMS OF THE NATURE OF DISCUSSION CERTAINLY I EXPECT THAT WE WILL BE CONTINUING GAUGED WE KNOW THAT THIS BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM STARS A LOT OF OPEN QUESTIONS THERE -- BUT CERTAINLY I THINK WE WANT YOUR INPUT AND ORDER FORM THE BILL THAT SHE TAKES AND IT TURNS OUT THAT SOMETHING PLACE WHERE YOU'VE THAT -- THAT -- THERE'S CONSIDERABLE CONCERN I THINK YOU KNOW THERE WILL BE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES BUT I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION TO HAVE AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION BUT ALSO CERTAINLY WANT. TO KNOWLEDGE AND RECOGNIZE -- YEAR CONCERNS ABOUT WILL WHERE EXACTLY THIS GONNA LAND AND WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE DON'T LAND IN A PLACE THAT -- THAT CERTAINLY -- SIMILAR NURSES WHO ARE ARE PROFESSIONALS WHO WORKING IN THE HOSPITAL FEEL THAT IS IT IS UNSAFE SO -- SO WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT LOOK FOR TO THE ON GOING CONVERSATION SO THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER STONE US THERE PORTANTINO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE OUT BRIEFLY -- AND ELIMINATING THE MANDATE IS NOT. IN IN THE BILL AND YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS. AND THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES BECAUSE TRUE TO WHAT WE'RE AFTER HERE IS A IS A THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION.

HEY WILL NOW RETURN TO SPECIAL ORDER -- CENTER STONE'S VICE CHAIR. IF YOU WANT TO HEAR. OKAY MORE EMOTIONAL YEAH OKAY. AND I WILL OKAY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. WELCOME TO THE CAPITAL FOR HERE TO HEAR NOW. SB [inaudible] TWO SEVENTY SIX DOCTOR PAN SIGN UP [inaudible] SENATE [inaudible] THIS. OKAY TO REMIND THE AUTHOR IN THE PROPONENTS OF THE WILL HAVE SIX MINUTES -- WITH THE WITNESSES AFTER SENATOR PENN MIXES PRESENTATION. AND CAM OKAY THANK YOU. VICE CHAIR SENATORS. I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TO PRESENT SB SENATE BILL TWO SEVENTY SIX THE BILL THAT MAINTAINS AND RESTORES INTEGRITY TO MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS TO LEGALLY REQUIRED VACCINES FOR SCHOOL ENROLLMENT. THE FIRST WAS STATE THAT I ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AND I THINK THE HEALTH COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS -- AMENDMENTS SB TWO SEVENTY SIX ENSURES THAT STUDENTS WHO TRULY NEED A MEDICAL EXEMPTION WILL RECEIVE EXEMPTION WALRUS KEEPING THE SAME CHILDREN SAFE AT SCHOOL BY ENSURING THAT THERE'S COMMUNITY MUNITY. THIS BILL PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF THESE CHILDREN TO ATTEND SCHOOL ENSURES CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE FREEDOM TO GO ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITY WITHOUT BEING AT RISK. OF BEING INFECTED WITH SERIOUS PREVENTABLE DISEASES. THERE HAVE ALREADY BEEN SIX HUNDRED TWENTY SIX CASES OF MEASLES I HOPE THAT'S THE MOST RECENT NUMBER BECAUSE IT KEEPS GOING UP REPORT IN THE UNITED STATES THIS YEAR WITHOUT BREAKS OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE CASES IN NEW YORK CITY. A HUNDRED NINE EIGHT HUNDRED NINETY NINE CASES IN ROCKLAND COUNTY NEW YORK SEVENTY FOUR CASES IN WASHINGTON STATE FORTY AND FORTY THREE CASES IN MICHIGAN. ALL OF THESE OUTBREAKS OF SPREADING COMMUNITIES WITH LOW VACCINATION RATES. THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN OVER THIRTY MEASLES CASES IN CALIFORNIA THIS YEAR INCLUDING THREE SEPARATE CASES AND AT LA ACTS AND THE MOST RECENTLY HAD TWO CASES HERE IN SACRAMENTO THEY ARE JUST REPORTED. MANY OF THESE INVOLVED UNVACCINATED PEOPLE WHO OFTEN CATCH MEASLES OVERSEAS AND THEN RETURN TO CALIFORNIA WITH THE DISEASE. IN FACT JUST YESTERDAY SHASTA COUNTY REPORT AN INFANT TOO YOUNG TO BE VACCINATED IS CONFIRMED HAVE MEASLES WHO WAS INFECTED BY UNVACCINATED WOMAN. AS REPORTED IN THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE WELL MEASLES HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO CALIFORNIA ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THIS YEAR UNLIKE OTHER STATES. CALIFORNIA HAS NOT SUFFERED A LARGE OUTBREAK. MEASLES OUTBREAK LIKE THE ONE THAT WE EXPERIENCED THAT BEGAN AT DISNEYLAND TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN BECAUSE THIS LEGISLATURE TOOK ACTION. BY PASSINGSB TWO SEVEN SEVEN THAT BEGAN RESTORING TO MEDIUM UNITY TO NEIGHBORHOODS IN CALIFORNIA. IN FACT SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN HAS BEEN. SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING STATE VACCINATION RATES FOR EACH AND KINDERGARTEN ENTERING CLASS ABOUT 95% ENOUGH TO BEGIN RESTORING THIS COMMUNITY THE SHIELD THAT PROTECTS OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THIS PROTECTIONS ALSO BEING UNDERMINED. BY A HANDFUL OF UNSCRUPULOUS PHYSICIANS WHO ARE PROFITING FROM PUTTING CHILDREN AT RISK AND MAKING OUR SCHOOLS LESS SAFE. SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN DID NOT SUBSTANTIALLY CHANGE THE GRANT TO MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS BY PHYSICIANS AND FACT THE EXPECTATION WAS THAT EACH CHILD WOULD BE VALUED BY THEIR OWN PHYSICIAN WHO RIDLEY CARE FOR THEM. AND WHO THEN EVALUATE WHETHER THEY NEED AN EXEMPTION BY APPLYING THE STANDARD OF CARE. HOWEVER AFTER THE PASSAGE OF SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN WHAT WE ACTUALLY WITNESS WERE PHYSICIANS TO ADVERTISE EXEMPTION FOR CASH ON SOCIAL ME IN THE INTERNET. MANY OF THEM WHO ARE NOT THE RED CHILD'S REGULAR PHYSICIAN. IN FACT WE'D SEE SOME PARENTS POST -- ON SOCIAL MEDIA THAT THEIR CHILD THE CHILD'S ACTUAL POSITION TO REGULAR POSITION REFUSED TO GRANT THE CHILD MEDICAL EXEMPTION SO THEY TRAVEL TO GO PURCHASE ONE FROM A DISTANT POSITION. AN INVESTIGATION BY THE VOICE OF SAN DIEGO OF MEDICAL EXEMPTION SUBMITTED TO THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. SHOW THAT ONE PHYSICIAN TO ADVERTISE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS ON HER WEBSITE ISSUED ALMOST A THIRD OF ALL THE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IN SCHOOL DISTRICT. THE POSITION WHO ISSUED THE SECOND MOST NUMBER OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WHO WAS NOT A SPECIALIST IN PEDIATRICS IS ACTUALLY ON PROBATION WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE IN THIS ARE AND TREATMENT OF PATIENTS. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT PROMINENT ANTI VACCINE PHYSICIAN DR BOB SEARS WHO'S ALSO ON PROBATION WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD FOR GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND REPEATED NEGLIGENT ACTS. FOR GRANTING AN APPROPRIATE MEDICAL EXEMPTION% ISSUE THE FOURTH GREATEST NUMBER MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AND SACK IN THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. THE RESULT OF THESE BAKER MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS WAS MORE THAN A TRIPLING OF THE NUMBER OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IN THE STATE. BUT MORE CONCERNING AS INITIALLY REPORTED BY THE LOS ANGELES TIMES. THERE ARE SEVERAL SCHOOLS OF MEDICAL EXEMPTION RATES ABOVE MANY STUDENTS AT THESE SCHOOLS ARE AT RISK FOR A MAJOR OUTBREAK. THESE SCHOOLS WITH THESE LOW VACCINATION RATES REPRESENT THE TENDER BRED DISEASE WILDFIRE THAT CAN HARM THE BROADER COMMUNITY. CALIFORNIA CANNOT ALLOW A HANDFUL OF UNSCRUPULOUS POSITIONS TO PUT OUR CHILDREN IN DANGER. PARTICULARLY BABIES TOO YOUNG TO BE VACCINATED IN CHILDREN WHO GENUINELY NEED A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. AND THAT IS WHY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS ARE THE SPONSORS OF SB TWO SEVENTY SIX ALONG WITH THE PARENTS OF ACTUALLY CALIFORNIA. POSITIONS ARE HOLDING THEMSELVES INTO COLLEAGUES ACCOUNTABLE TO PRACTICING QUALITY CARE BASED ON SCIENCE TO KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE. SB TWO SEVENTY SIX WERE REQUIRED POSITIONS IN THE FUTURE TO SUBMIT REQUESTS FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTION TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT LIKE HEALTH PREVAIL YOU ATION. THE BILL REQUIRES BASIC INFORMATION FROM THE POSITION INCLUDING YOUR NAME IN LICENSE NUMBER AND THE REASON FOR THE EXEMPTION. THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER OR HER DESIGNATE A REVIEW THAT REQUEST AND ISSUE AN APPROVAL OR DENIAL WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR APPEAL WHEN CLARIFYING INFORMATION SUBMITTED. REQUESTS WILL BE EVALUATED USING EVIDENCE BASED GUIDELINES PUBLISHED ANNUALLY BY THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES. THESE GUIDELINES INCLUDE CONTRADICT ASIANS AND PRECAUTIONS FOR AVOIDING OR DELAYING VACCINATION WHICH ESTABLISHES THE END OF CARE. I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT THESE GUIDELINES ARE OFTEN VERY UP THE CAUTIONARY BECAUSE EVEN IF THERE'S A REMOTE CHANCE OR MAYBE HARM THAT BECOMES A PRECAUTION. CURRENT STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT TO THE ISSUE A MEDICAL EXEMPTION TO CURRENT STATE LAW. IT REQUIRES THAT THE ISSUE MEDICAL EXEMPTION POSITIONS MUCH VERIFIED THAT THE CHILD'S PHYSICAL CONDITION OR MEDICAL CIRCUMSTANCES ARE SUCH THAT THE MUSICIANS. IS NOT CONSIDERED SAFE. SB TWO SEVENTY SIX WILL PROVIDE THE OVERSIGHT REQUIRED TO ENSURE WIDELY ACCEPTED. EVIDENCE BASED STANDARD OF CARE SAFETY GUIDELINES ARE APPLIED FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS ARE ISSUED SO OTHER CHILDREN ARE NOT ENDANGERED. CURRENTLY MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS ARE ISSUED BY FAMILIES THE BY POSITIONS TO FAMILIES TO SUBMIT THEM TO SCHOOLS UNFORTUNATELY THIS MEANS THAT PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO INFORMATION ON WHICH CHILDREN HAVE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. THAT'S SB TWO SEVENTY SIX REQUIRE ALL EXISTING MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS BE FILED WITH THE CALIFORNIA TE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH DREAMED TO REMAIN VALID AND THESE EXEMPTIONS WILL BE INITIALLY GRANDFATHERED WITHOUT REQUIRING FURTHER REVIEW. HOWEVER TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH WE ARE POWERING STATE AND COUNTY HEALTH OFFICERS WITH THE AUTHORITY TO INVALIDATE INAPPROPRIATE EXEMPTIONS TO MAKE COMPROMISE THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN IN PUBLIC HEALTH. THE SUBMISSION OF MEDICAL POSITIONS TO PUBLIC HEALTH PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT PROVIDES IMPORTANT INFORMATION TO CONTAIN AN OUTBREAK. IN THE EVENT OF AN OUTBREAK SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS HAVE TO REQUIRE AND VACCINATED STUDENTS REMAIN HOME TO PREVENT SPURRED FURTHER SPREAD DISEASE IN THE SCHOOL AND IN THE COMMUNITY. THE NEED FOR THIS INFORMATION FORTUNE WAS ILLUSTRATED BY A MEASLES OUTBREAK THAT OCCURRED IN THIS. AREA LAST SPRING WHEN IN UNVACCINATED CHILD WAS INFECTED WITH MEASLES IN EUROPE. AND RETURNED WITH THE DISEASE THE CALIFORNIA. THIS CHILD THEN TRANSMITTED THE DISEASE TO OTHER VENN BACKS THE CHILDREN. INCLUDING CHILDREN OF A OF A FAMILY WHO LIKE TO PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS THE LIGHT THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS THAT THEIR CHILDREN VACCINATED. IN TRUTH THEY HAD PURCHASED INAPPROPRIATE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FROM THAT POSITION HUNDREDS OF MILES AWAY. UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE THEY LIED THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS DO NOT KNOW AND DO NOT FOLLOW UP UNTIL ADDITIONAL PEOPLE WEREN'T AFFECTED BY THESE EXAM TO CHILDREN AND WHEN THEY DID THE TRACING BACK IT WENT BACK TO THIS FAMILY. HAVING MEDICAL EXEMPTION INFORMATION COULD HAVE PREVENTED FURTHER SPREAD OF THE DISEASE. SB TWO SEVENTY SIX IS ABOUT KEEPING OUR STATE AND COMMUNITY SAFE FROM PREVENTABLE DISEASE. THE REPORTS OF MEASLES OUTBREAKS THIS YEAR UNDERSCORE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO PASS SB TWO SEVENTY SIX TO MAINTAIN THE HARD WON GAINS WE MADE AND WITH SB. TWO SEVEN SEVEN WE MUST NOT LET A HANDFUL UNSCRUPULOUS POSITIONS. SEEKING THE PROFIT FROM FAKE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS TO UNDERMINE THE SAFETY OF OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR COMMUNITY. YES I AM PLEASED. TO INTRODUCED THREE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF SB. TWO SEVENTY SIX WE HAVE DOCTOR SERGIO FLORES A TRUSTEE AND ELECTED TRUSTEE OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. WITH DOCTOR ERICA PAN WHO BY THE WAY IS NO RELATION TO MYSELF. WHO IS A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER IN ALAMEDA COUNTY? ANALYSTS ARE HERNANDEZ AT THE PARENT OF A MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILD WHO NEEDS WE NEED A COMMUNITY BEAUTY TO KEEP HER CHILD SAFE. WITH THAT I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB TWO SEVENTY SIX THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELCOME DOCTOR FLOOR IS -- DOCTOR ERICA PAN AND MISS FERNANDEZ -- DOCTOR FLOORS ARE YOU GONNA START THANK YOU. AND IF I NAMES LIKE REMIND YOU YOU. SIX MINUTES COLLECTIVELY NOW ALL KIND OF REMIND YOU WHEN YOU GET CLOSE. WELCOME WE WELCOME YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU MY NAME IS A RESEARCHER FLOOR ISN'T HERE ON BEHALF OF THE OVER FORTY FOUR THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. AS A PROUD CO SPONSORS OF SB. TWO SEVENTY SIX I AM CURRENTLY THE VICE PRESIDENT OF A LARGE EIGHT HUNDRED PHYSICIAN MEMBER MEDICAL GROUP IN SAN YOU'LL SHARK ME MEDICAL GROUP. I ALSO WAS ELECTED BY MY LOCAL AND STATEWIDE PEERS TO SERVE ON THE BOARD OF THE MEDIC MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. IN THE INCIDENT MEDICAL QUALITY AS WELL AS A SEND YOU COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETY. IT IS TIME FOR THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY TO DO ITS PART TO CALL OUT THOSE AMONG US WHO ARE NEGLECTING THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO THEIR PATIENTS. AND THE PUBLIC AT LARGE. TRANSPOSITIONS WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT COMMUNITY IMMUNITY IS AN IMPORTANT ROLE WE PLAY IN PROTECTING OUR PATIENTS. VACCINES SAVE LIVES AND ARE ESSENTIAL IN HELPING US CONTROL DISEASES THAT NOT LONG AGO WERE MORTAL THREATS TO PUBLIC HEALTH. TODAY WE MUST PASS SB TWO SEVENTY SIX AND IS FOR THE HIGH STANDARD OF CARE AND AND SCRUTINY WHEN GRANTEE MEDICAL EXAMS AS IS MAINTAIN ACROSS THE STATE. SB TWO SEVENTY SIX DOES JUST THAT IT REMOVES THE ABILITY FOR ANY POSITION TO ACT OUTSIDE OF THE ACCEPTED STANDARD OF CARE. AND GET AWAY WITH IT. PRACTITIONERS TAKE A NOTE TO RESPECT THE HARD ONE SCIENTIFIC GAINS OF THOSE POSITIONS WHO STEP WHO LOOK WHO CAME BEFORE US. UNFORTUNATELY A HANDFUL OF OUR CARLY'S WHO BRAZENLY ADVERTISE THE SALE OF MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS VACCINATIONS ARE NOT LIVING UP TO THAT'S BOTH. AND HAVE PUT OUR STATE COMMUNITY IMMUNITY AT RISK. PASSAGE FOR PUBLIC SPACES LIKE SCHOOLS GROCERY STORES AND PARKS ARE UNSAFE FOR THOSE WO ARE MEDICALLY COMPROMISED IN CANNOT RECEIVE VACCINATIONS. THE FACT THAT MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FOR VACCINATIONS HAVE MORE THAN TRIPLED. CANNOT BE RECENTLY EXPLAINED. THAT IS BECAUSE MOST OF US IT IS A MORAL THAT A SMALL HANDFUL OF PHYSICIANS ARE ALLOWING PARENTS TO PURCHASE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. FOR THEIR CHILDREN WHO SHOULD OTHERWISE BE VACCINATED. THERE IS NO REASON FOR ONE PHYSICIAN TO WRITE A THIRD OF THE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IN THE ENTIRE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO. AS REPORTED EARLIER WE SHOULD NEVER ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN AND WE SHOULD ACT TO PUT THE STOP TO THIS UNSCRUPULOUS BEHAVIOR. THESE PRACTITIONERS UNDERMINE THE INTEGRITY OF PHYSICIANS WHO GRAN NEEDED MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FOR VACCINATIONS FOR THE SMALL NUMBER OF PATIENTS WHO TRULY NEED THEM. WE ARE COMMITTED TO OUR PATIENTS CARE AND HEALTH. WE ARE COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT THEY ARE SAFE TO PLAY AT THE PARK OR GO TO SCHOOL. THAT IS WHY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND I ARE CO SPONSORING AS BE. TWO SEVENTY SIX GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN HEALTH COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS DOCTOR ERIC UPON I AM HERE TO REPRESENT THE HEALTH OFFICER'S ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY I AM THE INTERIM HEALTH OFFICER FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY. I'M ALSO A PRACTICING PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE AS A LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIAL. CLEARLY NOW MORE THAN EVER WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AS A BROAD COMMUNITY TO PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND MAINTAIN COMMUNITY COMMUNITY. WE'VE ALREADY HAD MORE CASES OF MEASLES IN CALIFORNIA IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THEN ALL OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IN A SERVICES GO BAY AREA THIS YEAR WE'VE ALREADY HAD TEN CASES. IN OUR COUNTY WE HAVEN'T HAD A CONFIRMED CASE YET BUT WE HAD TO ACTIVATE OUR PUBLIC HEALTH. EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO START TO RESPOND TO ALL THE REGIONAL CASES AND WE FOLLOWED UP AN ALMOST NINETY CONTACTS IN EXPOSED PERSONS. IN ADDITION TO THE ONE IN A THOUSAND RISK OF DEATH OR BRAIN FUNCTION FROM MEASLES AND HIGH HOUSE POSITION READS. THE PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE IS SIGNIFICANT AND EXPENSIVE. WE ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF EXPENSE PER CASE IS ABOUT TEN TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. DURING THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN DISNEYLAND MEASLES OUTBREAK PUBLIC HEALTH COSTS WERE ESTIMATED TO BE ONE POINT FIVE TO THREE POINT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA. WE KNOW AND SEE THAT OUTBREAK START IN CLUSTERS OF UNVACCINATED PERSONS. THIS PUTS THOSE ARE VALID REASONS NOT TO BE IMMUNIZED AT RISK. OF SEVERE DISEASE. WELL THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE WE HAVE SEEN THAT IT IS NOT ENOUGH. WE DON'T HAVE CURRENT DATA AS A PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT UNAWARE INVALID EXEMPTIONS HAVE BEEN GRANTED BUT WE DO HAVE PLENTY OF ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE OF ANTI AGING -- CLINICS HYPERBARIC MEDICINE CLINICS IN ONLINE EVALUATIONS FOR HIGH FEES RATHER THAN PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS PROVIDING THESE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. REQUIRING PUBLIC HEALTH APPROVAL OF ALL MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS WILL PREVENT THIS INAPPROPRIATE PRACTICE.

IF NOT WE'RE GOING TO INVITE THE OPPONENTS TO COME UP. TO THE TABLE WE CAN MAKE ROOM PLEASE IMMIGRANT. MUCH GOES ON SO I WELCOME AS WE A ALLOW -- OUTLINED THE RULES EARLIER YOU'LL HAVE SIX MINUTES COLLECTIVELY. BUT WE WELCOME YOU. WHO WOULD LIKE TO START BY? FELLOW CITIZENS I AM DOCTOR NICOLE CHIRAC. I AM A BOARD CERTIFIED PEDIATRICIAN AND HAVE PRACTICED MEDICINE FOR THE PAST NINETEEN YEARS IN CALIFORNIA. I BELIEVE IN VACCINES I VACCINATE MY PATIENTS IN MY OWN CHILDREN BUT I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT IS TOO EXTREME. I AM SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE THOUSANDS OF DOCTORS WHO OPPOSE THIS BILL. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PATIENT AND THEIR DOCTOR IS SACRED. AND PATIENTS HAVE A RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR MEDICAL TREATMENT DETERMINED BY THEIR DOCTOR. NOT A GOVERNMENTAL APPOINTEE. THIS BILL WILL ESSENTIALLY DESTROY THE SANCTITY OF THE DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP. LIKE MY COLLEAGUES I HAVE WITNESSED CASE IS A VACCINE INJURY SOMETIMES RESULTING IN DEVASTATING NEUROLOGICAL ILLNESS. AS DOCTORS WE ARE CALLED TO CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE UNIQUE MAKE UP OF OUR PATIENTS WHEN ADMINISTERING VACCINES TO PREVENT VACCINE INJURY. SHOULD THIS BILL BE PASSED THE MEDICAL DECISION OF WHETHER OR NOT VACCINATING WILL BE SAFE WILL NO LONGER BE IN THE HANDS OF THE PHYSICIANS. INSTEAD A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIAL WITH MINIMAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE PATIENT WILL BE FORCED TO DETERMINE SAFETY USING ONLY THE CDC GUIDELINES FOR CONTRA INDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS. THESE GUIDELINES ARE TOO NARROW AND DO NOT INCLUDE ALL POSSIBLE CONDITIONS LEAVING CHILDREN WITH GENETIC IN CHRONIC IMMUNE DISORDERS VULNERABLE. THAT IS WHY THIS BILL IS CALCULATED TO INCREASE VACCINE INJURIES ESPECIALLY AMONG MEDICALLY COMPLEX CASES. I SPOKE WITH THE CDC AND THE CDC THEMSELVES REPORTS THEIR GUIDELINES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DOCTOR SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE OF THE PATIENT. AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE USED ALONE AS AN ABSOLUTE DETERMINATION OF CARE. THE DOCTOR IS IN THE BEST POSITION TO MAKE THE ULTIMATE DECISION. USING THE GUIDELINES AS SUPPORT IF NEEDED. THE TRUTH IS THERE IS NO REAL PROBLEM AND THIS BILL ISN'T NECESSARY VACCINE EXEMPTIONS HAVE DECREASED. CALIFORNIA SCHOOL VACCINATION RATES ARE ABOVE THE 95% NEEDED TO PROVIDE HER COMMUNITY. AND THE CONCERN FOR POSSIBLE FRAUDULENT MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IS NOT FOUNDED AS THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD HAS DONE ITS JOB AND INVESTIGATED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE CASES. AND HAS FOUND. ZERO IF THE DOCTORS PRACTICING OUTSIDE THE STANDARD OF CARE IT IS THE JURISDICTION OF OUR STATE'S MEDICAL BOARD TO POLICE THIS. THIS BILL DELEGATES POLICING NORMALLY DONE BY OUR STATE'S MEDICAL BOARD TO A HEALTH OFFICER. HOW IS IT JUST TO HAVE A HEALTH OFFICERS OPINION OVER POWER THE PATIENT'S OWN PHYSICIANS OPINION? NOT ONLY IS IT ON JUST BUT IT IS A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT TO HAVE AN EDUCATED DECISION WE CAREFULLY CONSIDER BE OVERTURNED BY A HEALTH OFFICER. WHO IS NOT ADEQUATELY INFORMED AND HAS NO RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR UNIQUE PATIENTS? I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IN CLOSING THAT WE MUST BE CAREFUL WHEN GIVING ANY MEDICATION TO A PATIENT AND VACCINES ARE NO DIFFERENT. WE CAN DO GREAT HARM IF WE APPLY A UNIVERSAL ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. THIS BILL IS DANGEROUS TO THE MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN OF OUR STATE AND FINALLY IT'S DANGEROUS TO THE MEDICAL FREEDOM OF THE PEOPLE. THANK YOU. ROB [inaudible] HELLO LADIES. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. PLEASE WE WE HAVE RULES. YOU'RE TAKING TIME AWAY FROM THE OPPOSITION THEY USE ARE OFF ANALYSTS ANNUAL SPACE TO THIS TO THIS SO BY VACCINES MY FAMILY'S RESPONSIBLY AND I WRITE MEDICAL EXEMPTION FOR THE LESS THAN 1% OF INDIVIDUALS THAT NEED PROTECTION. THIS BILL NOT ONLY DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM IS STATES BUT IT PUTS MANY PEOPLE IN HARM. FIRST QUESTION WHAT PROBLEM IS A BILL TRYING TO SOLVE TOTAL EXEMPTION RATES HAVE GONE DOWN NOT UP FROM FOURTEEN THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND SINCE SB. TWO SEVEN SEVEN YES THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION RATES HAVE GONE UP FROM POINT TO TWO POINT 7%. BECAUSE THOSE WHO PREVIOUSLY HAD PERSONAL EXEMPTIONS COUNTY MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS IT IS NATURAL THAT AND EXPECTED THAT THE NUMBER WILL GO UP. SO WHO ARE WE TWENTY SAVE FOR RECEIVING EVERY DAY WE HAVE MASS MEDIA HYSTERIA OVER MEASLES BUT WHO IS DYING NUMBER OF DEATH ZERO IN FACT MAYBE ONE INDIVIDUAL IN THE PAST TEN YEARS. THE CURRENT VACCINATION RATE BY THE CALIFORNIA. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH STATES THAT ALL KINDERGARTEN INDEXING RE TO OVER 96%. SOLD LACK OF VACCINATIONS CANNOT BE THE REASON FOR THIS SO CALLED EPIDEMIC. IF WE ANT TO SEE LIVES LET'S FOCUS ON REAL PROBLEMS HOMICIDE AND SUICIDE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEENS THE CDC DATA SUGGEST TWENTY CHILDREN DIE PER DAY. IN THE TWO FIVE TO TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLDS MEASLES ZERO SUICIDE TWENTY PER DAY. NEXT PROBLEM THIS BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THE DEFINITION IT IT IT DOES CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN LAW WHO PUT IN WHO QUALIFIES FOR MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. HE HAS CHANGED A WAR TO CONTRA INDICATION. WHICH MEANS ESSENTIALLY COMA BRAIN DEATH YOU KNOW SEVERE ANAPHYLAXIS. NUMBER ONE THE BILL EXCLUDE CONSERVATION FOR ALL THE SERIOUS CONDITIONS LISTED ON THE SHEETS WE WILL GIVE YOU. IT ALSO WILL HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIAL DOES THAT DOES NOT KNOW YOUR CHILD CITY HERE AND CHECK FOR BOXES FOR CONTRA INDICATIONS ONLY. THIS IS A TRAVESTY THIS IS THIS BILL NUMBER TWO I TREAT MANY FAMILIES WERE VACCINE IN YOUR FIRST CHILD. DO YOU THINK IT'S REASONABLE AND RESPONSIBLE TO TELL THE FAMILY THAT THE MOST TAXED EITHER SECOND CHILD WHEN THEY HAVE. TO DO WITH THE WHOLE LIVES HAVE CHANGED NUMBER THREE BEHIND RIGHT OVER HERE IS DOCTOR CHRYSLER AND DOCTOR LEE. AND MANY OTHER FAMILIES WHILE ASKED TO STAND UP AFTER THE TESTIMONY WHO WILL HAVE A VACCINE YOUR VACCINE IN YOUR CHILDREN THAT DO NOT FIT THIS NARROW DEFINITION OF COUNTRY INDICATION. PLEASE NOTE THAT WHILE VACCINE CAUSING INJURY IS NOT AT TRIAL HERE OVER FOUR BILLION WITH A B.. CABIN P. TO VICTIMS OF VACCINE INJURY THE THE NATIONAL CHILDHOOD INJURY COMPENSATION ACTS SO NO ONE CAN DENY THERE'S NO VACCINE INJURIES NO ONE WE ARE NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOCIETY WE DOCTORS TO BE HYPOCRITICAL TO DO FIRST DO NO HARM. IT IS OUR JOB TO ANALYZE A PROTECT THE 1% THANK YOU YOUR TIME IT I NOT OKAY TO SACRIFICE ANY CHILDREN TO BRING DOWN THE NUMBERS FROM POINT SEVEN TWO POINT 3% THANK YOU.

IN OPPOSITION LAST CALL. SEEING NONE. OF A CHAIR BEFORE WE BEGIN QUESTIONS OF ASPEN PLEASE ALLOW MY WITNESSES. STATE TO BE AT THE FRONT OF TAKES SOME OF WHICH IS HAVING A SO THEY CAN DECIDE WHICH THREE THE RIVER ON THE TABLE. SENATORS -- THIS IS THE TIME FOR QUESTIONS SENATOR [inaudible] MONEY. WHICH IS THAT YOU GOT THAT. ONE I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR MASS PHONE AND RESPECTFUL HANDLING OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT MUCH APPRECIATED. INTO THE AUTHOR -- DOCTOR PAN I APPRECIATE -- YOUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS -- IN -- HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU AND THEN I THINK FOR SOME OF THE WITNESSES. NUMBER SIDES -- SEVERAL OF THE WITNESSES SUGGESTED THAT THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION WOULD BE REMOVED. THROUGH THIS LEGISLATION IS IT YOUR INTENT TO REMOVE THE MEDICAL. EXEMPTION FORCE NOT AND WE'RE PROTECTING THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION I WOULD PROTECTING THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION FROM FRAUD. BUT PROTECTING THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION FROM. FORTUNATELY -- WE SEEN THIS BEFORE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WHERE. WE'D EXPECT AND ACTUALLY THE VAST MAJORITY OF POSITIONS DO -- PRACTICE -- BASED ON THE BEST SCIENCE BASED ON PROTECTING THE PUBLIC PHONE FORTY WHAT WE'VE SEEN AFTER TWO SEVEN SEVEN IS THAT WE HAVE PHYSICIANS WHO ARE REALLY TRYING TO MAKE MONEY. BUT THEN. HURTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH -- AND THE ISSUE IS NOW AS WE HAVE SCHOOLS WITH LARGE NUMBERS MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AS I POINTED OUT IN THE VOICE OF SAN DIEGO -- INVESTIGATION OF THE TOP WRITERS AND MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE ADVERTISING FOR THEM TO HAVE -- YOU KNOW THAT THEIR CHALLENGES OF THE MEDICAL BOARD -- THAT IS NOT WHAT WE WANT WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO GENERALLY NEED TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO TRULY HAVE A GENUINE MEDICAL EXEMPTION WE'LL GET WE'LL HAVE THOSE AND THOSE THOSE OF MEAT AND THEIR CHILDREN NEED TO BE PROTECTED. IN YOUR VIEW -- IS A GOOD MEDICAL PRACTICE. TO PROVIDE AN EXEMPTION WITHOUT. MEETING WITH THE PATIENT. CERTAINLY YOU SHOULD BE MEETING WITH THE PATIENT ARE ACTS OF REGIONAL EXPECTATION WOULD BE THE CHILD'S PHYSICIAN WHO'D BE DOING EVALUATION FOR THE EXEMPTION THEY SHOULD. CERTAINLY NOT BE SELLING THEM AND WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS WE SEE PHYSICIANS TOO MANY IN MY HEART EVEN TEACHERS AS A FAMILY PHYSICIANS. WHO ARE BASICALLY ISSUING MEDICAL EXAMS AS THE PATIENTS THAT FOR THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THEY'RE QUITE SEEN THEM? FOR AND THAT'S NOT WHAT THE SHOULD BE HAPPENING. SO THANK YOU IN IN MY DISTRICT FROM. THIRTY ONE SCHOOLS FALL UNDER THE 95% VACCINATION RATE SOME DRAMATICALLY BELOW THAT IS CLOSE 70%. FROM. MY QUESTION I GUESS FOR THE OPPONENTS FIRST AND THEN I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE PROPONENTS -- FOR THE OPPONENTS SOME IS THERE A PARENT IN THE OPPONENTS GROUP. NOW LET ME AS ONE OF THE DOCTORS THEN -- IS IT FROM. OKAY WELL AS PARENTS AS DOCTORS IS AN NINE THE IMMUNIZED CHILD. SAFER IN A CLASSROOM WHERE OTHER STUDENTS ARE IMMUNIZED. WHERE IS SEEN NINE IMMUNIZE STUDENT? SAFER IN A CLASSROOM WHERE THE OTHER STUDENTS HAVE BEEN IMMUNIZED. THAT'S MY QUESTION. THE PLEASE AS THE QUESTION. WELL I SEEN THAT BACKS. TRANSACTION IS NOT ALWAYS A 100% IF YOU LOOK AT AT THIS MOMENT A LOT OF THE VACCINE. SPREADING AT YOU KNOW IN IN THE SCHOOLS -- NINETY FOUR IS THERE ANY CIRCUMSTANCE I MEAN ASK IT THIS WAY. IS THERE ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. IN WHICH AN NINE IMMUNIZE CHILD. WOULD BE BETTER PROTECTED IN A CLASSROOM WHERE THE OTHER STUDENTS. HAVE BEEN IMMUNIZED. THAT CERTAINLY CAN BE TRUE AND AT THE SAME TIME BUT MAJORITY OF THE VACCINE THE MAJORITY THE DISEASES THAT ARE SPREADING RIGHT NOW THE SCHOOLS. HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE IMMUNIZATION RATES. BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE A NINETY SIX POINT 5% IMMUNIZATION RATE. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHAT WEST LIKE HARVARD YOU KNOW -- PROCESSES OUTBREAK 1100% OF ALL THE CHILDREN. HAD FULL IMMUNIZATION AND THE EIGHTEEN STUDENTS THAT WERE NOT UNIONIZED DID NOT. CATCH THE DISEASE SO AT THAT YOU KNOW TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT THAT YOU ARE IMMUNIZED OR NOT EVEN AS MANY TIMES. WHETHER REGARDLESS OF YOUR VACCINE STATUS. WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT. THAT THAT PROTECTION IS THERE THANK YOU WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF PARENTS TODAY. WHO TOOK PRIDE IN THE FACT THAT THEIR CHILDREN WERE NOT IMMUNIZED -- WITH THEIR CHILDREN BE AT GREATER RISK IF THEY TRAVELED TO A DEVELOPING NATION WHERE THERE WAS AN EPIDEMIC OF PROTESTS THIS OF POLIO. YOU HEARD FROM A LOT OF CHILDREN AND PARENTS TODAY THAT HAVE MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN THAT WOULD BE AT RISK. SO THERE ARE LOTS OF PLACES AROUND THE WORLD. THAT THEN IT IN ME IMMUNIZATIONS RATES COULD BE VERY VERY LOW AND SPEAKING OF SOMEONE GETTING -- INFECTION BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES. SO WE HAD IT IN HIS READING HIGH LEVEL ICE OF THE IMMUNIZATION AND BUT THAT'S THE WELL IT'S EVEN WITH HIGH LEVELS OF IMMUNIZATIONS. NONE OF THE INFECTIONS NOT OF THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW ACTUALLY HAPPENING YOU KNOW. IN THE SCHOOLS IF YOU LOOK AT THE DISNEYLAND IT WAS ALL NOTS WITHIN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. NOT A 85% OF THE MONTHS CASES THAT YOU HAVE SEEN IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN. RAINY NIGHT STE SO SO WHAT'S CLEAR IS THAT YOU'RE NOT JUST AT RISK IN A CLASSROOM YOU CAN BE AT RISK AT DISNEYLAND -- ON AN AIRPLANE OR ON A BUS IS THAT TRUE. LET ME LET ME DEFER TO THE OTHER DOCTOR BECAUSE I THINK YOU WANTED. TO OFFER A COMMENT YEAH I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I I DON'T THINK WHAT'S ON THE TABLE TODAY IS WHETHER OR NOT VACCINES. ARE VALUABLE BECAUSE THEY VERY CLEARLY AREN'T BEING IMMUNIZED IS VALUABLE. BUT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT IS -- ATTEMPTING TO VACCINATE A VERY SMALL PERCENT OF THE POPULATION WHO ARE MEDICALLY FRAGILE AND WHO CAN HAVE SERIOUS REACTIONS RELATED TO THAT. AND SO THE AND IT ISN'T GOING TO CHANGE THE OVERALL HERD IMMUNITY IN OUR SCHOOLS AND IN OUR CLASSROOMS IT WON'T AFFECT THE RATE OF EPIDEMICS THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING. IN MEASLES BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HAPPENING IN SCHOOL CLASSROOMS. RELATED WHEN WHEN YOU LOW HEARD OF MUNITY THANK YOU WHEN YOU HAVE A CLASSROOM THAT HAS 70%. OR LESS IMMUNIZATION DOES THAT POSE A RISK OF A CONSTITUENT ABSENT A CRIME SO RUDELY IT THEY HAVE AN IMMUNE COMPROMISED CHILD. THEY WOULD LIKE THEIR CHILD TO ATTEND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL THERE FEARFUL OF THAT CHILD CONTRACTING A POTENTIALLY FATAL. DISEASE BASED ON A LOW LEVEL OF IMMUNIZE STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT A CHILD WHO IS ON IMMUNIZED WILL BE PROTECTED BY HAVING A HIGHER IMMUNIZED. RATE IN THEIR CLASSROOM THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'D LIKE TO ASK THE PROPONENT. YES I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO THAT -- AS A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIAL BOWS AND SEVEN CISCO COUNTY TALKING AND COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE STATE. I HAVE SEEN CLUSTERS OF UNPACKS OF HIGHER RATES A WHOOPING COUGH IN SCHOOLS WITH LOW VACCINATION RATES. AND I ALSO AM VERY CONFIDENT THAT THE UNDER VACCINATION CLUSTERS ARE WHAT'S DRIVING THE CURRENT OUTBREAK THE CURRENT INCREASING MEASLES IN THE COUNTRY AND IN THE STATE. AND THERE WAS SOME TESTIMONY EARLIER THAN -- WE DON'T HAVE. EVIDENCE OF FATALITIES FROM THE MEASLES WHAT ARE THE PUBLIC HEALTH RISKS OF MEASLES. BUT AGAIN I A WOOD RESTATED IN THOUGH ONE OF THE PUBLIC DISMAY WITH ONE IN A THOUSAND CANYON AND SOCIALITE AS WHICH IS A BRAIN INFECTION OR DEATH. THERE'S AN ISRAELI FLIGHT ATTENDANT RIGHT NOW IS IN A COMA FROM -- THERE'S A LARGE OUTBREAK IN ISRAEL RIGHT NOW WHICH IS ALSO DRIVING UNDER. VACCINATED POPULATIONS IN NEW YORK STATE -- AND AGAIN IT'S ONE OF THOSE AND I KNOW THAT IN NEW YORK CITY RIGHT NOW IT WAS ACTUALLY OVER A WEEK OR TWO AGO THEY SAID THERE ARE FIVE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT. MEASLES CASES SO THE VERY SERIOUS DISEASES AS A HIGH FIDELITY RATE FOR INFECTIONS IS PREVENTABLE. IN A CHILD WHO'S NOT. YET. THE APPROPRIATE AGE FOR MEASLES VACCINATION BE PUT AT RISK IF. YES BECAUSE TYPICALLY. INFANTS TO NOT GET VACCINATED UNTIL TWELVE TO FIFTEEN MONTHS OF AGE SO THOSE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE WHO ARE TRYING TO PROTECT. THANK YOU AND IF I COULD MISTER CHAIR. JUST TO COUPLE FINAL QUESTIONS FOR THE AUTHOR. I THINK THERE'S SOME CONFUSION AS TO WHAT YOUR BILL. DOES AND DOESN'T DO AND I'D LIKE TO JUST ASK HOW DOES A FAMILY WHO. HAS A HISTORY IN THEIR FAMILY -- OF LET'S SAY -- A COMPROMISE CHILD AND THEN A SIBLING IS BORN THEY'RE WORRIED. ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THAT. NEW BORN ON UNDER YOUR BILL. WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO THAT FAMILY TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF A NEWBORN OR THERE'S HISTORY IN THE FAMILY? OF IMMUNE REACTION OF IMMUNIZATION REACTION -- AND SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IS THAT THE PHYSICIAN -- WOULD -- FIVE FOUR IF. THE CHILD IS AT RISK. IN THE FOR RECEIVING A VACCINATION -- WHEN THEY APPROACH SCHOOL AGE ALTHOUGH OFTENTIMES SO HAVE THE CONDITION AND WAY BEFORE THEY ENTER SCHOOL -- THEY CAN THEY WOULD FILE A REQUEST TO THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HOUSE. WHICH SHOULD BE REVIEWED AND THEY WOULD BE REVIEWING IT BASED ON THE SCIENCE THAT'S WHAT THE CDC ACIP RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BASED ON I WOULD BE NOTE THAT WE WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST STATE TO DO THIS THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA HAS BEEN DOING THIS SUCCESSFULLY. THEY'VE NOT HAD ANY PROBLEMS -- WITH PEOPLE WHO NEED TO TRULY GET JET MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS TO GET THOSE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS -- SO THAT WE WHAT WE NEED TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY THE CHILDREN WHO REALLY DO NEED TO MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS BECAUSE THEY CAN IF THEY CAN HAVE THE SAFETY VACCINATED. AS YOU POINTED OUT WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT THE OTHER KIDS AROUND THEM ARE SO THAT WE CAN KEEP THEM PROTECTED AND THAT THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL REALLY IS ABOUT. THANK YOU AND THEN ACTUALLY I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE MOTHER WHO TESTIFIED EARLIER -- YOU HAVE I BELIEVE AN IMMUNE COMPROMISED CHILD. YES IN WHAT AGE IS YOUR CHILD IS TWO YEARS OLD. AND I THINK IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU SAID YOU WOULD. LIKE HIM TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND PUBLIC SCHOOLS [inaudible] YES [inaudible] AND WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR YOU TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE. THAT YOUR CHILD COULD SAFELY ATTEND. A PUBLIC SCHOOL -- JUST THE HEALTH OF OTHERS THAT FAT PEOPLE IMMUNIZE THEIR KIDS AND THAT I DON'T YOU KNOW HE CAN'T HAVE THESE LIVE VACCINES AS MEASLES AND AND CHICKEN POX AND SO THOSE. THOSE DISEASES ARE DEADLY TO MY SON -- THEY PUT IN AUTOMATICALLY IN THE HOSPITAL AND THERE'S HARDLY ANY SURVIVAL RATE FROM IT SO -- I NEED I NEED TO BE SURE THAT THE KIDS IN THE SCHOOL ARE IMMUNIZED. WOULD YOU SEND YOUR CHILD TO A SCHOOL WHERE FEWER THAN 70% OF THE CHILDREN WERE IMMUNIZED. ABSOLUTELY NOT THANK YOU -- IN A I JUST GONNA CLOSE WITH A COUPLE OF COMMENTS AGAIN. I RESPECT EVERYBODY HERE TODAY PROPONENTS OPPONENTS. THE OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL THEY'RE PASSIONATE AND THEIR PASSIONATE BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THEIR CHILDREN. THEY CARE ABOUT. THE HEALTH OF THEIR FAMILIES BUT ARGUING THAT YOUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT IS BEING VIOLATED. WHEN THE STATE SEEKS TO REGULATE? VACCINATIONS TO PROTECT. BROADER COMMUNITIES THAT'S WHERE THE INDIVIDUAL CHOICE IS NOT JUST AN INDIVIDUAL CHOICE. WE WENT THROUGH THIS WITH. TWO SEVEN SEVEN PEOPLE ARGUED I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHAT I WANT FOR MY CHILD [inaudible] YES. UNTIL THAT CHOICE. INTERFERES WITH THE POTENTIAL HEALTH AND SAFETY OF MY CHILD OR MY GRANDCHILD AND THAT'S WHERE OUR JOB HERE IN SACRAMENTO. IS TO TRY TO THREAD THE NEEDLE IN FIND A WAY THAT PRESERVES YOU'RE RIGHT TO PRESERVE YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR PHYSICIAN. TO ENGAGE YOUR PHYSICIAN GET HER OR HIS BEST ADVICE. AND THEN AS NECESSARY SEEK A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. S. AS WELL FOUNDED IN SCIENCE BUT TO USE PERSONAL CHOICE AND USE THE DOCTORS EXEMPTION AS A WAY TO FULFILL. PERSONAL CHOICE THAT MIGHT PUT OTHER CHILDREN AT RISK. IS WHERE FOR ME IT CROSSES THE LINE. YEAR RIGHT TO YOUR CHOICE SHOULD NOT. INTERFERE WITH THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER CONVERSATION I'M SORRY TO TAKE TIME MY CALL WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR A LONG TIME I FIGURE. THIS DESERVES OUR FULL ATTENTION AND CONSIDERATION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THAT ARE RUNNING CENTER MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LET ME THANK YOU -- SENATOR STONE -- FOR YOUR COLUMN -- MANAGEMENT OF THE LE HEARING TODAY YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD A WEEK FULL OF BOB VERY EMOTIONAL TESTIMONY AN EMOTIONAL BILLS AND EVERYTHING FROM POLICE TRANSPARENCY -- TO THIS BILL -- ON THAT'S WHAT WHY WE'RE HERE AND IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT AND A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR RESIDENTS OF THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD TO ENGAGE IN BE PRESENT THIS PROCESS SO I APPRECIATE THAT. I ALSO APPRECIATE -- THE CIVILITY LARGELY THAT WE WERE ABLE TO ENGAGE ON AND SO I APPRECIATE THANK YOU I THINK THE SERGEANTS FOR HELPING TO MANAGE THE PROCESS. SO WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE SEEN -- TO THE PUBLIC TODAY HAVE THE UP TO BE SAME. AS I LISTEN VERY CLOSELY TO THE OPPOSITION. ONE THING THAT STRUCK ME. AND PERHAPS IT'S AN ISSUE OF SEMANTICS BUT I THINK THE DANGER. IN US GETTING LOST IN SEMANTICS IS I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VERY DIFFERENT POPULATIONS. AND SO IF. THROUGH THE CHAIR WHOEVER SO CHOOSES ON THE PANEL COULD. WALK ME THROUGH THIS WE HAVE HEARD. REFERENCES TO MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN. IMMUNE COMPROMISED CHILDREN VACCINE COMPROMISE CHILDREN AND VACCINE HARM TO CHILDREN AND I'M CLEAR THAT THOSE ARE ALL THE SAME POPULATION. SO A MOMENT AGO YOU SAID -- THAT THE PERCENTAGE -- YOU TALK ABOUT IT WAS A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN AND SO [inaudible] THIS BILL. IMPACTS WHICH OF THOSE POPULATIONS FOR TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN WHO WERE ALREADY TRAGICALLY BEEN VACCINE HARM. I GUESS THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION THAT OTHER CHILDREN THE FAMILY COULD ALSO BE SUSCEPTIBLE BUT CAN WE TALK ABOUT. HOW DO YOU DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN OF POPULATIONS ALL REPEAT MEDICALLY FRAGILE BECAUSE ALL MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN? ARE. THE AXING COMPROMISED CORRECT. IF YOU YOU WE JUST SAW OVER PROBABLY A THOUSAND DIFFERENT PEOPLE COMING FROM. I SAW THE LEGENDS YES DIFFERENT CULTURES I SAW THEM. SO EVERYONE HERE HAS A STORY AND IT IS THE DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP TO UNDERSTAND THAT STORY CAN YOU DEFINE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE FOR ME PLEASE. PHONE. SO WHEN YOU SAVE MEDICAL FRAGILE BURST THROUGH THE MAY BE VERY SIMILAR DEPENDING ON WHAT CRYING I'M CLEAR THAT I OPENED THE MAIN DOOR LET ME START OVER AGAIN LET ME START OVER. I'M CLEAR THAT SEMANTICS PEOPLE MAY BE USING TERMINOLOGY INTERCHANGEABLY I'M CLEAR ABOUT THAT BASED ON THE TESTIMONY THAT I LISTEN. TO MY QUESTION TO YOU AS A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL IT'S CAN YOU DEFINE AND DEFINE DOWN AND HELP. US ALL DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE TERMS THIS IS THE SHEET THAT YOU GUYS HAVE IF YOU LOOK YOU KNOW ON THE RIGHT SIDE. THESE ARE NON COUNTRY INDICATED. CONDITIONS THAT ANY ONE OF US THIS IS ISSUE THAT WAS ALLUDING TO A MINE YOU KNOW DURING MY TESTIMONY SO HOPEFULLY YOU'LL HAVE IT IF NOT WE'LL GIVE HIM TO YOU. ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS SOMEONE WHO MAY HAVE CREE EMBRACE SYNDROME I HAVE PATIENTS OF MINE. WHO HAD SEIZURES DURING THE FIRST? IN A VACCINE AND YOU KNOW WITH MOST MEASLES RUBELLA FOR EXAMPLE. AND THAT IS A MAJOR MEDICAL IN A MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILD SO NOW. THAT CHILD IS SIBLING MAY HAVE A ONE IN. TWO HUNDRED YOU KNOW ONE AND TWO HUNDRED RISK OF HAVING SEIZURES AND SOME OF THOSE SEIZURES CAN BECOME EPILEPSIES. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF PATIENTS HERE TODAY A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE ONE CHILD THAT HAS BEEN. MEDI MEDICALLY INJURED. AND IF THEY HAVE ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS HERE WILL NOW BE EXCLUDED. FROM THIS BILL WHICH PREVIOUSLY A DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP. COULD STATE THAT THIS IS. A MEDICAL. NO AT A CHILD THAT HAVE HAS HAD A IN TRAUMA. THESE KIDS CAN BEING MEDICALLY INJURED OR MEDICALLY FRAGILE THANK YOU AND IT IS OUR JOBS THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU COULD NOT ON ALL OF US MAYBE I'M NOT BEING CLEAR BUT I I'M. I'M NOT GETTING THE ANSWER I'M LOOKING FOR BUT THANK YOU I GOT THE LIST NOW -- DOCTOR PAN HOW DO YOU RESPOND. TO THE I BELIEVE IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE FIRST OPPONENT WHO TALKED ABOUT. ON WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR A MINUTE PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. AND THEIR OPINION IF YOU WILL TO FOR THE LACK OF A BETTER TERM TRUMP. A CHILD [inaudible] PHYSICIAN'S RECOMMENDATION SO pPLEASE THANK YOU THANKS SO MUCH FOR THAT QUESTION SIR MITCHELL I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE GRANTING OF A MEDICAL EXEMPTION IS ACTUALLY TRULY PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTION. IT'S NOT THE DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT OF A PATIENT SO I WOULD POINT OUT IS THAT ALTHOUGH THIS IS OFTEN UP SICK KID -- BY THE OPPONENTS OF POST THIS BILL AND FOR USE IT. TO SEVEN SEVEN IS THAT NO CHILD WILL GIVE VACCINATED AGAINST THEIR PARENTS CONSENT. THAT NEVER HAPPENS. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT THE CHILD THE FATE PARENT BRINGS A CHILD TO THE PHYSICIAN. THEY'LL HAVE A DISCUSSION -- THE POSITION AND THEIR TEAM WILL PRESENT THE INFORMATION OF THE VACCINE THE PARENT WILL DECIDE. WILL DECIDE WHERE TO GET CHILD VACCINATED OR NOT VACCINATED. THAT'S A DECISION THE PARENTS THAT'S A CURRENT LAW AS I TURNED WILL NOT CHANGE THAT WILL NOT CHANGE UNDER THIS BILL DO NOT CHANGE WITH TWO SEVEN SEVEN WILL NOT CHANGE WITH THIS BILL. RIGHT SO THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT TO POSE A PARENT CHOOSES NOT TO VACCINATE THEIR CHILD. RIGHT THERE'S A CONSEQUENCES. AND THE CONSEQUENCES NOT BECAUSE STEP PARENT MADE THAT CHOICE THE CONSEQUENCES TO PROTECT THE OTHER CHILDREN. THAT'S WHY IN TWO SEVEN SEVEN AM I WANT TO READ LITIGATE TWO SEVEN SEVEN HERE BUT I JUST I POINT OUT WE GAVE PEOPLE OPTIONS THAT'S WHY THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE SAID THERE'S OPTIONS FOR WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DON'T CHOOSE NOT TO VACCINES YOU CAN STILL GET YOUR CHILD. EDUCATED GET A PUBLIC EDUCATION SO FORTH BUT BUT WE HAVE TO PROTECT CHILDREN LIKE. MY WITNESSES HERE WHERE YOU AVE A CHILD WHO CANNOT TO BE VACCINATED SO THEN THE ISSUES THAT WE SAID OKAY FINE OF MEDICAL EXEMPTION YOU CAN GO TO SCHOOL. BUT THAT MEDICAL EXEMPTION -- IF IT'S NOT VALID WE END UP WITH SCHOOLS WITH MEDICAL ATTENTION RATES OF 30% 40% FIFTY FROM THAT'S NOT REALISTIC I THAT THAT'S THOSE ARE NOT REAL EXEMPTIONS UNLESS IT'S A SCHOOL FULL OF CHILDREN WHO HAVE. CANCER ARE HAVE TRANSPLANTS OR SOME OTHER PROBLEM AND THAT THEN PUTS THOSE CHILDREN AT RISK AGAIN AND THAT'S THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPAIRED AND THAT IS WHY. BY THE WAY THE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AMERICAN KHAKI APTRIX YOU'VE HEARD DISCOUNT COUNTY CHILDREN SPECIAL TEACHER COALITION THOSE ARE PEDIATRIC SUB SPECIALISTS WHO SPECIALIZE IN TAKING CARE OF MALCOLM MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN DEBT TO THE TAKE CARE ALL OF CCS KIDS. RIGHT THE KIDS WHO ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE AND THEY'RE STANDING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT'S THEIR PATIENTS ARE MOST AT RISK WHEN WE LET THESE FAKE MEDICAL EXCEPTIONS HAPPEN. AND SO THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS WE NEED PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENE TO SAY THAT WHAT WE NEED TO SORT OUT THE PEOPLE WHO GENUINELY NEED MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FROM THOSE WHO DONT BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE A HANDFUL OF PHYSICIANS. WHO ARE BASICALLY GRANTING MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AND APPROPRIATELY AND -- THAT AND ACTUALLY PERSONALLY ACTUALLY PROFITING FROM IT YOU CAN SEE -- SO THIS THIS IS PUTTING PATIENTS IN DANGER AND PARTICULARLY THOSE MEDICALLY FRAGILE PATIENTS AND THAT'S WHY. THE PHYSICIANS ARE ASKING FOR THIS BILL THE VERY PHYSICIANS ARE OFTEN HERE SAYING WE NEED TO PROTECT THE PATIENT DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT THE PATIENT DOCTOR RELATIONSHIP. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE SAYING BECAUSE AND WE NEED THIS BILL TO BE SURE THAT WE DON'T HARM PUBLIC HEALTH AND THAT MY PATIENT CO ON TAKING CARE OF IS ACTUALLY GONNA GET PROTECTED. THANK YOU FOR THAT THE YOU KNOW THE TRUE GOAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH OF PREVENTION AS OPPOSED TO REACTING AFTER THE FACT I MEAN THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IT'S TOO IT'S TO PROTECT US AND THEN REACTS AFTER THE FACT WHEN WE HAVEN'T DONE A VERY GOOD JOB ON THE FRONT END -- TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONAL ARE CAN YOU GIVE ME OTHER EXAMPLES NGUYEN. KIND OF A CONCERN AROUND BROADER PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY PUBLIC SAFETY -- PROCEEDS INDIVIDUAL CHOICE. A WILLOWS PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS AND OFFICIALS -- THERE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE WE WILL ACTUALLY ISSUE ILLEGAL ORDER FOR ISOLATION FOR EXAMPLE SO IF WE HAVE. A PATIENT WITH TUBERCULOSIS THAT IS INFECTIOUS WE WILL. GENTLY ISSHIN ORDERS OF THAT PERSON CAN BE TREATED AND MAKE SURE THAT PERSON IS TREATED AND NO LONGER INFECTIOUS TO THE PUBLIC. WE ALSO HAVE STORIES TO EXCLUDE ACTUALLY [inaudible] PEOPLE FROM. A CERTAIN SITUATIONS SO CHILD CARE'S AND WE HAVE HAD TO AGAIN IN THESE MEASLES OUTBREAKS THAT ARE ON GOING NOW. WE SOMETIMES HAVE EXPOSED INFANTS FROM AN AIRLINE FLIGHT OR FROM BEING IN A WAITING ROOM IN A CLINIC WHO'S BEEN EXPOSED TO MEASLES CASES THEY'RE TOO YOUNG TO BE VACCINATED. AND THEN THEY ACTUALLY WE TRY TO GET THEM POST EXPOSURE PREVENTION THAT'S PART OF A PUBLIC HEALTH ROLE SO WE GIVE THEM AN ANTIBODY TO HELP PREVENT THEM FROM. GETTING MEASLES BUT THEN THEY ALSO NEED TO BE KEPT AWAY BECAUSE THE INCUBATION PERIOD CAN BE A WEEK TO THREE WEEKS LATER. AND WE DON'T WANT -- PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE INCUBATING MEASLES TO BE OUT THERE THAT'S WHAT WE DO INPUBLIC HEALTH TO TRY TO CONTAIN THE DISEASE. SO THOSE ARE SITUATIONS WHERE WE TRIED A WE EXCLUDE PEOPLE FROM WORK SOMETIMES WHEN YOU DO SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE FOOD HANDLERS ARE IN YOU. THROUGH THAT COULD BE CONTAMINATED RIGHT OR THAT THEY HAVE TV OR WHATEVER -- GETTING BACK TO MY POINT SO SO THIS LIST THE TOP SAYS VACCINE REACTIONS SO THESE ARE REACTIONS PEOPLE MAY HAVE ONCE VACCINATED. AND SO THAT IS SEPARATE FROM A CHILD WHO MAY BE BORN MEDICALLY FRAGILE BORN WITH A COMPROMISED IMMUNE SYSTEM BORN WITH UNDERDEVELOPED LUNGS ECCENTRIC SETTER. SO DOCTOR PAN ON THIS LIST WELL THE PHILLIES ARE REACTIONS. THAT'S A DIFFERENT AND THE REASON I'M SAYING. AND WE'RE COMBINING. ALL OF THESE EXPERIENCES IN TWO ONE RATIONALE ABOUT OPPOSING THE BILL. IN A PROPERLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE -- WE HEARD WITNESSES SAY -- THAT THEIR CURRENT MEDICAL EXEMPTION. FOR WHATEVER REASON WHETHER THE BABY WAS MEDICALLY FRAGILE -- HAS IS IMMUNE COMPROMISED HAS HAD A PATH REACTION HOWEVER THEY DEFINED IT WOULD NOT QUALIFY UNDER. TWO SEVEN SIX IS THAT -- ACCURATE. THAT IS NOT ENTIRELY ACCURATE I THINK WHAT I WOULD SAY IS IS THAT. PLEASE PLEASE ACTIONS AT IN MY OPENING PRESENTATION. DISK LEADERS TO PHASES OF THE BILL FOR THE FIRST PHASES WE ARE ASKING THAT EVERY MEDICAL EXEMPTION THAT HAS BEEN GRANTED UP TO DATE AND MAYBE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS BECAUSE THERE SOMETIME FOR IMPLEMENTATION WILL BE AROUND THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE. FILED WITH THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- THE THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT NECESSARILY HALF WITH DAVID ON MAC WOULD BE ACTUALLY BE IN PLACE WE WOULD GIVE THE AUTHORITY FOR THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFTEN COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER -- TO REVIEW TO POTENTIALLY INVALIDATE ONES THAT ARE INAPPROPRIATE THAT PUTS PUBLIC HEALTH A RISK BECAUSE AND FORTUNE WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY THAT FORTY MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE APPROPRIATE -- BUT THERE'S NO ACTUAL REQUIREMENT THE PUBLIC HEALTH GO THROUGH ALL OF THE THAT BACKLOG BUT NOW REMOVING FORD IN A COUPLE YEARS WE WOULD HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS A PHYSICIAN WOULD THAT APPLY. TO THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND WITH THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PATIENT -- TH AT AND AGAIN MAINTAINING THE PATIENT PRIVACY LAWS AND THEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER WOULD DECIDE WHETHER TO APPROVE OR DENY THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WEST VIRGINIA AND THERE'S EVEN APPEAL PROCESS. IN CASE OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER NIGHT TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION TO ENSURE THAT THERE THAT THIS DECISION IS MADE IN THE MOST. APPROPRIATE WAY AND ALSO YOU KNOW WE REALLY WANT TO GIVE -- INVITE A LATITUDE AS POSSIBLE WE'RE WE'RE IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S TRULY IS AN ISSUE RIGHT WITH -- THAT WITH -- WITH VACCINES IN THOSE THEY REALLY DESERVE MEDICAL EXEMPTION I THINK IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE CDC GUIDELINES WHICH ARE BASED ON EVIDENCE. THEY ACTUALLY TEND TO LEAN TOWARD WELL IF IT'S POSSIBLY MIGHT EVEN WHATEVER THEN -- WILL PUT A PRECAUTION ON THEIR IMPACTS OF THIS A PRECAUTIONS IN CONTRADICTION SO WE ACTUALLY WANNA GIVE AS MUCH LATITUDE BUT ULTIMATELY WE ALSO RECOGNIZE WE NEED TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND WE DON'T WANT OUTBREAKS SO WHAT WE CAN'T HAVE IS -- I MEAN SOME OF THE THINGS ON YOUR HAIR LOSS. OKAY IS CURRENTLY ONE OF THE VACCINE REACTIONS LISTED ON YOUR CELLULITIS WHICH IS AN INFECTION OF THE SKIN. ARE YOU COULD GET SO LIES FROM INJECTION BUT IT'S PROBABLY NOT REALLY AND AND THERE'S NO. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE -- AND THE RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE I MEAN YOU'VE HEARD ACTUALLY SOME OF THE PEOPLE SAID MY CHILD HAS AUTISM AND THAT'S OUR VIçT EXENE REACTION THAT'S BEEN DEBUNKED THAT'S BEEN DISPROVEN AND THROUGH MULTIPLE STUDIES MOST RECENTLY IN A STUDY THOSE UNIDEN MARKET IS A GERMAN PLAYER TO ACTUALLY SHOW. THAT THE PEOPLE WHO WERE UNVACCINATED WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE BOXES AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE VACCINATED I MEAN IT WASN'T SPECIFICALLY SIGNIFICANT BUT THAT'S WHAT THE RAW NUMBERS SHOWED. SO I THINK WE NEED TO BASE OUR EVIDENCE OUR OUR DECISIONS ON SCIENCE AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS NOT TO GET EVERYONE VACCINATED BUT TO BE SURE WE PROTECT THE PUBLIC TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN AND THAT'S WHAT THE PURPOSES BILLS. FOR SO SO HELP ME -- THE GRANDFATHERING IN IS THAT -- SILENT IN THE BILL AND THEREFORE THAT'S WHAT WOULD HAPPEN OR IS THERE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT TALKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU WERE GRANDFATHERED IN SO WHAT THE BILL SAYS IS THAT IF YOU HAVE AN EXISTING MEDICAL EXEMPTION YOU FILE IT WITH APARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH ONE THE REASONS. WE ASK THAT IS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS. THEY GO TO THE SCHOOL AND THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY AVAILABLE TO THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT EXCEPT AS WITH THE NAMES REDACTED SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT -- IF THERE'S AN OUTBREAK WE ACTUALLY SAW THIS HAPPENED LAST YEAR IN THE BAY AREA. THERE'S AN OUTBREAK AND AND THE THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS DON'T KNOW WHO HASN'T BEEN VACCINATED IN THE SCHOOL. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET ACCESS TO WHO EXACTLY WHO HAS WHO'S BEEN VETS WHO HAS A MEDICAL EXEMPTION OKAY SO WE WE NEED THAT INFORMATION FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PURPOSES. FAMILY HELP YES EXACTLY AS COMMUNITY OF THE FAMILY TO HELP THEM TO BE SURE THAT -- WE WE PROTECT THE CHILDREN WHO HAVEN'T BEEN INFECTED YET AND GET IN AND GET THEM RE TRY TO REMOVE THEM FROM OUR OKAY SO I SEE THE LANGUAGE YOU'RE AFTER THE STATEWIDE STANDARDIZED MEDICAL EXEMPTION REQUEST FORM. DEVELOP. PURSUANT TO SECTION IS MADE AVAILABLE FOR USE AN EXEMPTION PREVIOUSLY ISSUE INTO THE SUBDIVISION IS VALID ONLY THE PAIR TO GUARD HAS COMPLIED. HAS COMPLIED WITH PARAGRAPH TO SAID WITH THAT SECTION. OKAY -- REMINDING ASKED THE QUESTION WITH REGARD TO FAMILY MEDICAL HISTORY. THE IF THERE IS A PARENT OR CHILD -- THAT HAS HAD. A REACTION THAT THEY WHAT. SO D. AS AGAIN THE THE CDC -- ADVISER COMMUNITY MUSICIAN PRACTICES NOW THEY LOOK AT THE SCIENCE AND THEY DETERMINED I COULDN'T HE WAS ACTUALLY AT RISK BECAUSE IDEALLY WHAT HAPPENS WE DON'T ADMINISTER A VACCINE TO A CHILD. TO WOULD BE AT RISK RIGHT WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE WAIT FOR SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED AFTER VACCINE WE WANT. TO PREVENT THE ACTOR SO WE WANT TO BE BEFORE AND THAT'S WHAT THE GUIDELINES -- ADDRESS. FINAL QUESTION THANK YOU FOR YOUR DILIGENCE -- MISTER VICE CHAIRS SO. THE CONCERN ABOUT DOCTORS WHO ARE INAPPROPRIATELY BE THAT FAILING OR WHAT HAVE BEEN THE CASE MAY BE ISSUING EXEMPTIONS. IS THERE ANYTHING THE MEDICAL BOARD COULD CURRENTLY DO UNDER CURRENT LAW. COULD THE MEDICAL BOARD -- STEP IN AND INTERVENE -- OR OR OR OR OR IS SB TWO SEVEN SIX NECESSARY TO PREVENT THIS AND ABUSE AND A AN INAPPROPRIATE USE I WOULD MAKE NOTE THE REASON -- THAT TO THIS BILL IS SUBMITTED NOW AND NOT IN THE IT IS MERELY WHEN WE KNEW THE KNACK ASCENSION RATE WAS GOING UP BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE MEDICAL PORTENT PARMA PUBLIC HEALTH. THE HOW TO ADDRESS THIS THE CHALLENGE FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA. THE CHARGE FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD CALIFORNIA'S THE NORMAL PROCESS IS THAT A PATIENT COMPLAINS ABOUT THIS BEHAVIOR BY PHYSICIAN. THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHEN THE MEDICAL BOARD INVESTIGATES THAT PATIENT PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE MEDICAL RECORDS NECESSARY FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD TO DO THE INVESTIGATION OF THAT POSITION. IN THIS CASE THE FAMILY IS IN CAHOOTS WITH THE DOCTOR IS NOT BEHAVING PROFESSIONALLY AND THEREFORE ARE NOT PROVIDING THE MEDICAL RECORDS TO THE MEDICAL BOARD TO EXAMINE -- SO IT'S IT'S MAKES IT VERY CHALLENGING FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD TO DO INVESTIGATION THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO TO A JUDGE TRY TO SUBPOENA RECORDS THEY WOULD HAVE THE NAMES OF THE CHILDREN THAT THEY SHOULD BE LOOKING AT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT. YOU'D HAVE TO GO AND SAY TELL THE JUDGE OH BY THE WAY I WANTED SUBPOENA THE ENTIRE MEDICAL RECORD FOR THIS DOCTOR IN GOING TO BUT SOMEONE PEOPLE MAY TERM A FISHING EXPEDITION TO LOOK. AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON EVEN THOUGH THEY KNOW THE STUFF THAT'S GOING ON NOW I WILL POINT OUT THE MEDICAL BOARD HAS ACTED ON ONE POSITION. THAT'S DOCTOR BOB SEARS WHERE PAY OR A FAMILY MEMBER DID COOPERATE AND IT TURNED OUT HE WAS ACTING NEGLIGENTLY AND TO HIS LICENSES ON PROBATION -- AT FOUR FOR DOING THIS BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD TO ACT THAT WHILE ONLY HAPPEN BECAUSE A FAMILY MEMBER ACTUALLY CHARLES TO HAVE THEIR RECORDS MADE PUBLIC AND AND AND NAMES MADE PUBLIC. YEAH CAM FORWARD EXACTLY SO THAT WHILE A CLAIM ABOUT NEGLIGENCE. YES THAT'S THE PROBLEM RIGHT SO YOU HAVE TO PERSUADE SOMEONE WHO WHO BOUGHT MEDICAL EXEMPTION TO WHY THE BACK OF THE ENGINE SAY -- NOW I FILE A COMPLAINT AND REVEAL THE RECORDS. AND SO THAT'S BEEN THE CHALLENGE FOR THE MEDICAL BOARD. NOW ACTUALLY WITH THIS BILL WITH AND PUBLIC HEALTH HAVING THE LISTS OF CHILDREN WHO GET MEDICAL CENTERS A. C. PATTERN. THEY ACTUALLY THEN CAN BE A DO MORE TARGET INVESTIGATIONS TRY SUBPOENA EVERY RECORD THEY COULD GO SUBPOENA THOSE PARTICULAR RECORDS AND GO AFTER PHYSICIAN WHO'S BEING PARTICULARLY BEING UNPROFESSIONAL AND AND AND AND AND FOCUS ON THAT BECAUSE THEY CAN GET THAT INFORMATION FROM THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I TOO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND I WANT THINK EVERYONE WHO'S BEEN HERE TODAY -- IN OPPOSITION AND IN SUPPORT THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE. DOCTOR PM LAST TIME AROUND I DID NOT SUPPORT THE BILL. I DO NOT SUPPORT FOR THE REASONS MOST PEOPLE THINK I'M FULLY VACCINATED MY HUSBAND'S VACCINATE OUR CHILDREN OR FULLY VACCINATED I HAD A CONCERN. OVER WORKING FAMILIES WHO DID NOT VACCINATE THEIR CHILDREN BUT NOT BILLS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO HOME SCHOOL THEIR CHILD. YOUR NEW BILL DOES NOT CHANGE THAT -- SAYS STILL CONCERN FOR ME BUT I THINK MY BIGGER CONCERN GOES ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT -- CENTER MITCHELL WAS ASKING ARE THESE DOCTORS WHO ARE. WHO ARE A RONI IS FULLY -- REALLY CIRCUMVENTING THE SYSTEM OR THEY FOUND A LOOPHOLE IN THE SYSTEM. AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR ALL OF US AND FOR EVERYONE WE LEGISLATE TO THE BAD ACTORS. AND WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE HERE WITH THIS BILL I'M GUESSING. IF WE DIDN'T HAVE DOCTORS WHO WERE DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING -- I JUST WANT TO FOLLOW UP A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT SENATOR MITCHELL ASKED. AND MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND IT IS WELL BECAUSE I DID HAVE A QUESTION TWO ABOUT THE DOCTOR'S GOING TO THE MEDICAL BOARD AND JUST GETTING RID OF THE BAD ACTORS. SO YOU HAVE EXPLAINED THAT THE REASON THAT'S A PROBLEM IS IF I SAY SURE YOU CAN LOOK AT MY RECORDS BUT THEN EVERYONE ELSE THE EVERITT APPEARANCES NO YOU CAN'T YOU HAVE TO SUBPOENA THEM THEY TAKE TOO LONG CORRECT. IT'S A IT'S A I'M NOT THE ATTORNEY -- BUT IMAGINE GOING TO THE JUDGE AND SAYING I WANT TO SUBPOENA EVERY MEDICAL RECORD OF THIS PARTICULAR POSITION GOOD I'M TRYING TO FIND THESE THINGS. YEAH WE WE DO WANT TO PROTECT PATIENT PRIVACY WE DON'T WANT THE MEDICAL BOARD GOING OFFICIALLY EXPEDITIONS AND I THINK THAT THAT WOULD RAISE CONCERNS IN THE JUDGE'S MIND ABOUT WHAT IT'S GOING HERE DAVID WHAT WHICH PATIENTS ARE YOU LOOKING AT WHICH ONES. INSTEAD OF TRYING TO DO A BROAD SWEEP THROUGH THE ENTIRE MEDICAL RECORD OF A PARTICULAR POSITION GOT IT SO IF YOU COULD JUST EXPLAIN TO US HOW YOU THINK THAT THE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. HOW THIS NEW SYSTEM UNDER YOUR BILL WOULD WORK AND I IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO ME? YES AND AGAIN I WOULD POINT OUT THAT WE WOULD NOT BE THE FIRST STATE TO DO THIS SO WE THERE IS EXT. OUT THERE IN ANOTHER STATE AND IT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IS THAT -- IS IT IS JUST TO PHASES AS I EXPLAIN SO IN THE FIRST PHASE BASICALLY PEOPLE JUST FILE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH IT WOULD HAVE INFORMATION IN CASE THERE'S AN OUTBREAK SO THEY CAN ACT ON IT. THERE WOULD BE THE ABILITY OF THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER AT PARTY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER TO INVALIDATE INAPPROPRIATE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS -- BECAUSE TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH RIGHT THERE'S AN OUTBREAK THERE'S THERE'S A THIRD THE OUT THERE CONCERNED THAT THE MUSICIAN RATES TO LOVE ME WHY EXAMINE THEM IN MORE DETAIL. AT TO TRY TO TO TO ADDRESS THAT AND THEN -- GIVEN. I THINK IT'S TWO YEAR IMPLEMENTATION TIME FOR PUBLIC HEALTH THEN WE WOULD MOVE TO THE MODEL THAT'S SAID USED BY -- ANOTHER STATE WEST VIRGINIA WHERE VISIT INSTEAD OF THE PHYSICIAN JUST ISSUING A MEDICAL EXEMPTION THEY WOULD APPLY FOR ONE THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF THE CULT THE TOP PART OF THE HEALTH OF THE REVIEW -- THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE PHYSICIAN -- LOOK AT IT THE RELATION TO THE GUIDELINES AND THEN ISSUE A MEDICAL EXEMPTION OR DENY IT IF THEY DENY IT THERE'S STILL OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT POSITION TO APPEAL THAT AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CLARIFYING INFORMATION. IN CASE THE OUT THAT THAT THERE THERE WASN'T ENOUGH INFORMATION TO TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE DECISION SO WE WANTED WE DO WANT TO TRY -- TO CREATE THAT -- TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE. EXEMPTIONS ARE BASED ON SCIENCE BUT ALSO WE WILL WE DO WANT TO GET SOME LATITUDE BUT WE DON'T WANT HAVE A SITUATION LIKE THIS WHERE PEOPLE GOING AROUND IT AND WE HAVE SCHOOLS IT'S NOT THE OVERALL RATE RIGHT NOW IT'S INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS THAT'S WHERE OUTBREAKS BEGAN. RIGHT. SO THANK YOU THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL SO IF I DECIDE. FOR ANY OF THE REASONS WE'VE HEARD TODAY THAT I DO NOT WANT TO VACCINATE MY CHILD AND I WANT TO TRY AND GET IT MEDICAL EXEMPTION. WHAT I DO THAT AS A PARENT WHEN MY CHILD IS ONE TWO THREE YEARS OLD BEFORE THEY GO TO SCHOOL? SO WHAT I WOULD HAVE TIME TO GET THAT MEDICAL EXEMPTION BEFORE THEY STARTED SCHOOL. YOU CAN CERTAINLY APPLY AT ANY TIME AND I WOULD CITY OF AND WE WOULD FROM CERTAINLY WANT TO EDUCATE PHYSICIANS THAT WHEN IF THE CHILD HAS A CONDITION. EVEN PRIOR TO GOING TO SCHOOL WHERE DAVID DEL MAR TO MEDICAL EXEMPTION THEY SHOULD JUST GO AHEAD AND APPLY SO THAT THEY HAVE THE OPERATION THE AUTHORIZATION FROM THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WE HAVEN'T HAD A IN WEST VIRGINIA HASN'T HAD A PROBLEM WITH PEOPLE -- GETTING CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE SAY SAY IN A WAITING FOR THE THE EXEMPTION WELL THAT SCHOOL STARTING. GOT IT SO IT SEEMS THAT YOU CAN STILL GET A MEDICAL EXEMPTION YOU HAVE UNTIL YOUR CHILD STARTS SCHOOL TO GET THAT MEDICAL EXEMPTION -- WHAT ALSO CONCERNS ME IS YOU KNOW? THE THE HERD MENTALITY OF THE HERD -- IMMUNITY. IN THE EVENT OF HEAT THAT THAT. TOO I WORRY THAT WE HAVE SEEN MORE OUTBREAKS OF DISEASES I'M FIFTY TWO YEARS OLD AND I DON'T EVER REMEMBER SEEING THIS IN MY LIFETIME. AND SO I WORRY THAT AS MORE MORE PEOPLE DON'T VACCINATE THEIR CHILDREN AND PEOPLE TRAVEL IN AND OUT OF THIS COUNTRY WHICH IS GREAT THAT'S WHY WE LOVE THIS COUNTRY. BUT IT IS DIFFERENT IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND IF THEY'RE BRINGING THINGS BACK AND AND AND I HONESTLY WORRY ABOUT THE CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT EVEN IS IMMUNIZED. BECAUSE THEY ARE AT GREATER RISK SO -- WITH THAT AND AGAIN WE LEGISLATOR THE BAD ACTORS WE MIGHT NOT EVEN BE HERE TODAY IF WE DIDN'T HAVE DOCTORS DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND LOOKING FOR THE LOOPHOLES. SO WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU SENATOR PAN. THERE IS A GERMAN -- WE WE'VE REALLY DONE A GREAT JOB I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY BUT WE WE JUST DON'T ALLOW ANY UPPERS SO. THIS WILL BE THE LAST WARNING BUT IF WE HAVE ANY OUTBURST WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE GOING TO CALL A RECESS AND WE'RE GOING TO VACATE THE ROOM. AND THEY WERE GONNA RECONVENE WE REALLY WANTED TO BE HERE TO HEAR THE DELIBERATIONS BUT WE GOT TO BE RESPECTFUL TO THE PROCESS HERE PLEASE. SENATOR GROW. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND AGAIN I WANT TO ECHO MY COLLEAGUES -- COMMENTS ON HOW YOU HANDLE THIS HEARING AND AND THAT THE LENGTH OF THE HEARING AND HOW MANY PEOPLE HAD TO BE FACILITATED THROUGH -- TO LET THEIR VOICE BE HEARD SO I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE AND YOUR PERSISTENCE IN MAKING SURE IS AN ORDERLY HEARING. I DO -- HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS BASED ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUES MADE AND DIRECTLY TO YOU SENATOR PAN. IT WAS HERE WHEN TO SEVENTY SEVEN WENT THROUGH AND AND I I DO SHARE THE SENTIMENT OF THE OPPOSITION THAT YOU KNOW YOU DID GIVE YOUR GUARANTEE THAT THAT BETWEEN THEIR DOCTOR AND THEM. AND SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IS THAT I KNOW YOU'VE ANSWERED AND SOMEWHAT BUT CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THE FACT THAT. THAT NOW WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE THAT GUARANTEE BETWEEN THE DOCTOR AND THE PARENT FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO STATE THAT WHEN I WAS TESTIFYING I WAS TRYING. I WAS TESTIFYING ACTUALLY TO WHAT WOULD BE THE STATE. OF THE SITUATION AFTER PASSAGE OF TWO SEVEN SEVEN AND BECAUSE WE DO NOT -- SUBSTANTIVELY AFFECT THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION -- IN THE BILL THAT WAS VERY INTENTIONAL ON TWO SEVEN SEVEN THAT -- EXISTING LAW WHICH WAS THAT MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS WOULD BE AT THE DISCRETION AND INDIVIDUAL JUDGMENT THE PHYSICIAN. WOULD BE IN PLACE THE EXPECTATION WAS IS THAT FOR MOST PART THAT WOULD. BE THE CHILD'S REGULAR PHYSICIAN AND THAT THEY WOULD BE FOLLOWING THE STANDARD OF CARE -- AND IN FACT -- THE HOPE WAS IS THAT THE THE MEDICAL BOARD WOULD BE IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO ACT -- FOR THOSE FEW PHYSICIANS TO UNFORTUNATELY WOULD ACT AND PROFESSIONALLY -- AFTER IMPLEMENTATION OF TWO SEVEN SEVEN WE SAW THAT. THAT WAS A FORTY NOT THE CASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POSITIONS OR ADVERTISING DO NOT THE REGULAR CHILD'S DOCTOR BE SEEN PEOPLE POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA MY CHILD'S DOCTOR WON'T GIVE ME A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. I HAD TO GO TRAVEL BY ONE RIGHT THAT'S NOT HOW IT WAS SUPPOSED TO WORK -- I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT IN CONVERSATIONS MEDICAL BOARD TURNED OUT A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED AS I EXPLAINED IN TERMS OF HOW THE MEDICAL BOARD TO TRY TO ENFORCE -- AT PERFECT AND PERFECT AGAINST UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR AND SO IT IS ACTUALLY THE PHYSICIAN COMMUNITY THAT SPOT THIS BILL IS SPONSORED HI. THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS -- SO THOSE ARE THE DOT AT THE ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING DOCTORS WHO ARE HERE REPRESENT DOCTORS TALKING ABOUT WE NEED TO PROTECT THE PATIENT DOCOR RELATIONSHIP. RIGHT AND AND AND DITION ADDITION TO THOSE THAT'S ALSO SUPPORT BY OTHER PHYSICIAN GROUPS AS WELL SO YOU HEARD LEADERS FROM THE MEDICAL PROFESSION COME TESTIFIED. PEOPLE WHO -- NOLLIE AT CMA IN A P. BUT ALSO YOU KNOW THE FOR PRESENTS A COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETY SPECIALTY SOCIETIES AND SO FORTH BECAUSE PHYSICIANS UNDERSTAND THAT. WE NEED WE HAVE A PROFESSIONAL DUTY TO PROTECT OUR PATIENTS AND ALSO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND THAT'S WHY IT'S THE MEDICAL PROFESSION THAT IT IS SPONSORING THIS BILL. I I APPRECIATE THAT BUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THERE'S MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE THAT ARE COMING TO THEIR I I WITNESSED MANY MEDICAL THERE'S A LOT OF RELATING. TO SITTING HERE THREE AND THEN THE PEOPLE THAT CAME UP TO TESTIFY THEY WERE FROM THE MEDICAL FACILITY YOU KNOW MEDICAL PROFESSION THEY WERE NURSES -- THEY WERE EMERGENCY ESPONDERS THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE MEDICAL FACILITIES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ARGUMENT. SO -- I GUESS I I DID NEED TO KNOW THAT I ON A SENATOR MONEY HAD MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THAT STEPPED ON SOMEONE ELSE'S INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT AND WHERE DO YOU DRAW THE DRAW THE LINE. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IS THAT WE'RE WE IS LEGISLATORS DRAW THE LINE IS A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT -- FOR OF YOUR WITNESS THAT'S HERE WITH THE A MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILD THEY'LL BELIEVE A LIVER TRANSPLANT YOU SAID YES A LIVER TRANSPLANT THAT CAN'T BE ANYONE IMMUNIZED OR BE EXPOSED. TO AUTO WHO I BELIEVE IS STILL SITTING THERE I CAN'T SEE HIM IS HE DOWN UNDERNEATH THERE. THERE YOU ARE. WHO IS -- VACCINE -- I MEAN OBVIOUSLY RIGHT VERY INTELLIGENT YOUNG MAN BUT IN A WHEELCHAIR BECAUSE OF THE VACCINE -- THAT HE RECEIVED. SO WHERE DOES HIS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT MEET SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT LIKE HE DOESN'T HAVE A RIGHT TO GO TO SCHOOL UNLESS HE'S VACCINATED. TO PROTECT SOMEBODY WHO'S MEDICALLY FRAGILE AND DOESN'T DE CAN VACCINATED THAT THEY WANT TO PROTECT THEM FROM AUTO BUT HOW DO WE PROTECT AUTO. FROM HIS AUTO IMMUNE DISEASE OR WHATEVER IS CAUSING HIM. TO HAVE AN ADVERSE REACTION TO THE VACCINE AND WHERE IS AUTOS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. OKAY SO FIRST OF ALL IF -- IF A CHILD. HAS A TRULY A A TRUE MEDICAL EXEMPTION -- THEN THEY WOULD GET MEDICAL EXEMPTION RIGHT THERE WOULD BE EXEMPTED. THAT'S THAT'S WHAT THE THAT'S WHAT THE LAWS THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL INTENSE SO THEREFORE IF THAT BUT IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO VACCINATE. SO IT'S NOT THAT YOU DON'T BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE ACTUALLY CHOOSE NOT TO VACCINATE. THENTHERE'S A CONSEQUENCE TO PROTECT OTHER CHILDREN ISLAND SINCE YOU MENTION CONSTITUTIONALITY I SHOULD MENTION THAT SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN FACED I THINK. FOR BY CHALLENGES IN COURT -- BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL COURT AND IS ONE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. THE COURTS HAVE SAID INTERPRETING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION UNITED STATES. THAT. VACCINE REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHOOL ART CONSTITUTIONAL DEBTS IN CASE LAW. THAT GOES BACK OVER A HUNDRED YEARS AND SO THEREFORE THAT THE COURTS HAVE RULED THAT SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE ONE THAT. IF YOU WANT I WILL CONSTITUTIONALITY. IS IS IS DEFINITELY CONSTITUTIONAL THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT AND THERE'S CERTAINLY NUMBERS CASES ABOUT THAT BUT LAWS IN OTHER STATES THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN IS CONSTITUTIONAL IT'S BEEN THAT THE THAT IN THE COURTS BOTH THERE AND IT'S BEEN. A IT'S BEEN RULED UPON ITS BEEN FINALIZED -- I WOULD THEN I WOULD POINT OUT IS IS THAT. THIS BILL WHICH IS ABOUT ACTUALLY REGULATING PHYSICIANS RIGHT AT AT AT AT A PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTION -- CERTAINLY AGAIN I SAID IT'S MY LEFT IN A STATE THAT'S BEEN FOUND CONSTITUTIONAL. BUT CERTAINLY -- THIS BILL IT IS IT'S CONSTITUTIONAL AS WELL I MEAN WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO REGULATE -- THE PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTIONS LIKE THE GRANTING MEDICAL EXEMPTION JUST LIKE WE CAN REGULATE HANDY OUT HANDICAPPED PLACARDS -- FOR CARS THAT FOR LIKE A OFFER PARKING OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS ARE RELATED -- TO USING A PUBLIC SERVICES ARE ARE PUBLIC SPACES I MEAN THAT THAT IS THE FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT IS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND SO WE'VE OFTEN PASSED LAWS TO PROTECT PUBLIC TO WE HAVE LOTS TO KEEP KIDS. KIDS SAFE IN SCHOOL WE SAY CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN'T DO AND NOT DO AND AND AND SCHOOL RIGHT WE TELL PEOPLE YOU CAN'T DRIVE DRUNK ON THE ROADS. RIGHT THAT -- THAT YOU TAKING THAT CHOICE AWAY BECAUSE IT'S A DANGER TO OTHER PEOPLE YOUR RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHAT YOU WANT TO DO STOPS WHEN THAT CHOICE. WELL IN DANGER AND HARM OTHER PEOPLE AND SO THAT'S GENERALLY BEEN THE CASE AND SO AGAIN THE COURT HAS RULED DEFINITIVELY THAT -- THE VACCINE REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHOOL AND SB TWO SEVEN PARTICULAR IS CONSTITUTIONAL CAN I AND I UNDERSTAND THAT MY APPRECIATE THAT BUT MY I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IS THAT. IT'S DIFFERENT THAN SAYING YOU CAN'T DRIVE DRUNK ON THE ROAD OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE SAYING THAT. YOUR WITNESSES CHILD GETS TO GO TO SCHOOL UNVACCINATED BUT IF AUTOS PARENTS CHOOSE NOT TO VACCINATE HIM BECAUSE HE DAVE BELIEVE THE VACCINE OR THEY HAVE PROOF THAT THE FAXING CAUSED HIM. TO BE IN A WHEELCHAIR THE REST OF HIS LIFE HE HASN'T GOT THE RIGHT TO GO TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY'RE CHOOSING NOT TO VACCINATE HIM IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. NO I WANTED TO ACTUALLY LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE -- THAT TO CAME UP -- SO THERE I WHEN WE WERE DOING TWO SEVEN SEVEN THERE WAS A MOTHER WHO I COMMUNICATE WITH ME HER CHILD ACTUALLY. HAD A HEART TRANSPLANT BECAUSE SHE HAD CAN GENERAL HEART DISEASE. AND THE REASON SHE WAS COMMUNICATING SHE SAID MY CHILD WAS SENT HOME FROM SCHOOL AND TOLD TO STAY AWAY FROM SCHOOL FOR TWENTY ONE DAYS. WHY WAS MY CHILD THE NINE DIRECT TO GO TO SCHOOL BECAUSE ANOTHER FAMILY? WHO CHOSE NOT TO VACCINATE WONDER CHILDREN GOT CHICKEN POX THAT WOULD KILL? POTENTIALLY KILL THE CHILD TO GOT TO TRANSFER IN FACT SHE HAD GOTTEN CHICKEN POX ONCE BEFORE AND AFTER THE ICE YOU ALMOST DIED. SO THE SCHOOL IN FEAR FOR HER SAFETY THEN SENT HER HOME -- CHILD HOME TO PROTECT HER CHILD IN KEPT TOLD THEM THAT THEY COULD NOT BRING HER CHILD'S SCHOOL INNER CHILD WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL BE WITH THEIR FRIENDS. BUT THE FAMILY WHO CHOSE NOT TO VACCINATE. DESPITE FACTORS NO REASON THEY COULD BE ACCINATED THEIR CHILD STILL GUY GOT TO ATTEND SCHOOL HE SAID WHAT'S THE JUSTICE WHAT'S THE RIGHT THERE DAY MADE A CHOICE BUT I DIDN'T I DIDN'T HAVE A CHOICE I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE. SO IF THERE'S A CHILD WHO GENERALLY HAS A MEDICAL EXEMPTION THEN THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED TO ATTEND SCHOOL THAT'S THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF TWO SEVEN SEVEN THEY GENERALLY HAVE. A MEDICAL CONTRA EDUCATION A PRECAUTION TO VACCINATION -- SO I DON'T HAS ONE THEN HE WOULD GET A MEDICAL EXEMPTION YOU CAN GO TO SCHOOL. OKAY. EVAN I AM OF MOVE ON TO ANOTHER QUESTION CAN YOU GIVE ME AND CALIFORNIA EXAMPLE OF THE VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASE OUTBREAK THAT OCCURRED IN ONE OF THE POCKETS. OF UNVACCINATED CHILDREN ARE THE AREAS WHERE THERE'S A HIGHER PERCENTAGE I THINK SENATOR BUNNING SAID 270% OF US SOME OF THE SCHOOLS IN THIS DISTRICT WERE. ARE NOT VACCINATED OR ARE VACCINATED BUT IT'S AT A 70% THRESHOLD AND 796%. SO IS THERE A IS THERE A CALIFORNIA EXAMPLE DIRECTOR SEVERAL CALIFORNIA'S SAMPLE SO FOR EXAMPLE WELL FIRST OF ALL AN EXAMINATION OF THE OUTBREAK THAT START IN DISNEYLAND. THAT -- BASICALLY MAINLY SPREAD AND AMONG UNVACCINATED POPULATIONS SO WHILE THERE IS A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE GOT VACCINATED TO DID GET THE DISEASE IT'S A BIT PRIMARILY AMONG THEM VACCINATED. WHAT WE HAVE FOR TESTIS OUTBREAK IN TWENTY TEN HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT I'D LIKE TO MENTION THAT -- INK -- NINE INFANTS DIED SEVERAL HUNDRED WERE OVER HOSPITALIZED -- DAY AGAIN EXAMINED WHERE DID THE WORD THAT PROCESSES OUTBREAK SPREAD AND IT MAINLY SPREAD IN AREAS WITH LOW VACCINATION RATES IS BASICALLY IS DEFINED BY. HI PERSONAL BET BELIEVE EXEMPTION OUR LOW VACCINATION RATES OF KIDS OF THE SCOPE OF PEOPLE ATTACK OF SCHOOLS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND SO THE RESEARCH AFTER THE MAGIC RESEARCH IS DEFINITELY IDENTIFY TENS TRACE. THAT THESE OUTBREAKS ARE RELATED TO COMMUNITIES WITH LOW VACCINATION RATES AND IS WERE LOOKING AT OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE STILL ON GOING SOME OF THESE OUTBREAKS GOING ON RIGHT NOW TODAY AND AS MEASLES ACROSS THE COUNTRY -- BUT SO PEOPLE NEED TO GATHER BUT THE CURRENT DATA SHOWS THAT IT'S MAINLYSPREADING AND COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN-TARGETED -- WITH LOW VACCINATION RATES OF THE OUTBREAK GOING ON IN NEW YORK AGAIN LOW VACCINATION RATE COMMUNITY -- THE ONE TO HAPPEN MINNESOTA BUT THE IN THE SMALL THE COMMUNITY FOR THE VACCINATION RATE WENT FROM THE 90% SOUNDS I THINK AROUND 40% THAT THEY HAD A MEASLES OUTBREAK -- THE IN WASHINGTON CITY WASHINGTON ACTUALLY THE OUTBREAK AGAIN AND COMMUNITIES OF LOW VACCINATION RATES I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THOSE ATTORNEYS VERTICALLY TARGETED WITH ANTI VACCINE THIS INFORMATION -- SO THEIR ANTI VACCINE GROUPS -- THAT WENT OUT TO THIS COMMITTEES PRIOR TO THIS OUTBREAKS AND DROVE DOWN THE VACCINATION RATES AND NOT SURPRISINGLY THEY NOW HAVE MEASLES OUTBREAKS GOING ON SO IN FACT THE TAUGHT TARGET THE SLAVIC COMMUNITY AND AS A LOT OF PEOPLE AND STOP THE COMMUNITY HERE. THE TARGET THE SLAVIC COMMUNITY IN STATE OF WASHINGTON -- IS -- AND THAT'S WHERE THE OUTBREAK A LOT THE OUTBREAK HAPPENED AND SO THAT'S THAT'S THE DANGER THAT WE HAVE WE HAVE AREAS WITH LOW VACCINATION RATES. THAT'S WHAT THE OUTBREAKS HAPPEN IN TWENTY TEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAD INFANTS DIE OF THE VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASE BECAUSE OF THAT. SAYS A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL AND I I RESPECT YOUR OPINION -- THERE WAS A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WHOOPING COUGH OUTBREAK IN HARVARD WESTLAKE SCHOOLS IN THE CASES -- WERE ALL VACCINATED KIDS LIKE DATA ALL RECEIVED VACCINATIONS -- THERE WERE EIGHTEEN KIDS THAT WENT TO THAT SCHOOL THAT WERE NOT VACCINATED FOR WHATEVER REASON THE PARENTS CHOICE THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION I'M NOT SURE WHY BUT THEY WEREN'T VACCINATED. NONE OF THOSE KIDS WERE AFFECTED BUT THE ONES THAT WERE AFFECTED WERE VACCINATED KIDS. HOW IS THAT HALF OF FIRST OF ALL YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND EACH VACCINE HAS ITS OWN PROFILE SO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THE CHALLENGES WERE HAVING WITH THE PROTESTS AS VACCINE IN FACT THIS IS ONE OF OUR RESPONSES HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO THE PROTEST THIS OUTBREAK IN? TWENTY TEN WAS ACTUALLY DO REQUIRE FOR TOSSES VACCINATION AT TWELVE YEARS OLDER ENTRIES SEVENTH GRADE THAT'S WHEN THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED ACTED ON THAT. BECAUSE THE THE PROTECTIVE VACCINE THAT'S CURRENTLY USE THE A CELL IN A PROTEST AS VACCINE. UNFORTUNATE DOES NOT LAST AS LONG -- AND IT IN FACT ACTUALLY PROTECT THIS WAS A YOU CATCH FOR TOSSES THAT THE ACTUAL DISEASE YOU ONLY DEVELOP A LIMITED TIME YOU IMMUNITY DEBT WAYNE'S. SO -- THAT'S BEEN SO SAME WITH THE VACCINATION AS WELL AND SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WHAT YOU YOU DO SUPER TOSSES OUT BREAKS AND SOMEONE WILL BRING UP MONTHS IN RIGHT AND WE SEE THESE MOMS OUTBREAKS. THE GENERALLY AND FOR AND POPULATIONS WHERE THE VACCINATION ITSELF MIGHT HAVE WORN OFF A BIT AND SO THAT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE LOOK AT THAT ENTRY NEW RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT VACCINATION SO BEFORE LOOKING AT THE PROTEST AS VACCINATION RIGHT NOW WE RECOMMEND EVERYONE YOU GET ONE VERY TEN YEARS AFTER YOUR INITIAL. SERIES BEFORE LOOK AT DO WE NEED TO SHORTEN THE AMOUNT OF TIME SO IT REMAINS EFFECTIVE BECAUSE THE THE TIME THE STATE'S OTHER PROTESTERS. PROTECTION ACTUALLY LAST IS AS LONG AS THE OLD ONE SO THE RECOMMENDATION STILL BASED ON THE OLD -- THE PERSISTENCE OF IMMUNITY OF THE PREVIOUS VACCINATION AND SO THAT'S WHY WE REVISE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON IT AN IMPROVED DATA THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE VACCINE DOESN'T WORK IT JUST MEANS THAT THE VACCINE. WORKS IT WORKS THE WAY IT WORKS SO AND THAT AND SO WE'VE SIZE NEED TO MODIFY -- EXACTLY HOW WE ADMINISTER VACCINES MMR ON THE OTHER HAND -- ONCE YOU GET TO VACCINATIONS FOR MOST PART -- WELL THERE'S THAT THAT WILL BE PROVIDE LIFETIME IMMUNITY -- TO TWO PEOPLE UNLESS YOU TO BECOME A NEW COMPROMISE FROM CANCER OR SOMETHING ELSE LATER ON IN LIFE SO THAT IN THAT CASE YOU JUST GET THE TO AND CHILDHOOD YOUR GOOD IF YOU ONLY GET ONE THOUGH. USE THAT YOU'RE MORE VULNERABLE AND THAT'S WHAT WE SW FORTY WITH THAT -- FLIGHT ATTENDANT -- WHO'S IN A COMA RIGHT NOW IT ISRAEL THEY ONLY RECEIVED ONE AND SO I TO AT ELEVEN ONE ELEVEN CHANCE OF DEVELOPING THE DISEASE. THANK YOU AM I JUST HAVE TWO MORE QUESTIONS AND I DO APOLOGIZE A BECAUSE I KNOW WE'VE BEEN HERE. A REALLY LONG TIME YOU TALKED ABOUT THE THE ISSUES THE SIGN BEHIND YOU THAT SAYS THAT THERE ARE YOU KNOW BAD APPLES IN THE PHYSICIAN INDUSTRY. I AGREE WITH SENATOR LABOR THAT WE TEND TO LEGISLATE. YOU KNOW REGARDING THE ACTIONS OF BAD APPLES OR PEOPLE THAT -- ARE BAD ACTORS IN IN PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES AND THEN WE KIND OF THROW THE BABY OUT WITH THE BATH WATER I GUESS IS THE BETTER STATEMENT THAT I WOULD THINK IF. AND I A I REALLY THINK THAT THIS IN MY PERCEPTION I BELIEVE AND I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD NOT BEING ABLE TO GO AFTER THESE BAD ACTORS. BUT TO ME THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE THERE FOR I MEAN THERE THERE TO GO AFTER THE BAD MEDICAL ACTORS SO I DON'T SEE WHY THEY CAN'T ONE FACE THAT CAN SEE THAT. IN AND GO INTO THE THIS FACILITIES AND CHECK THOSE BAD ACTORS DOWN BEFORE WE VIOLATE THE RIGHTS APPEARANCE. AND TO CHOOSE WHETHER THEY THEY WANT THEIR KIDS VACCINATED OR HAVE THESE THESE VACCINES. I MEAN JUST I MEAN INSERTED INTO THEIR KIDS I GUESS -- WHEN THEY FEEL THAT THEIR KIDS ARE -- MEDICALLY FLORA JEWEL OR LIKE MISS MITCHELL SAID AND A VARIETY OF REASONS THAT WILL -- PUT THEIR KIDS AT RISK. SO -- AND YOU SAY THERE'S NO WAY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD CAN REGULATE THESE BAD ACTORS WELL IT SAYS IT AND SAY IT'S VERY DIFFICULT WHAT HAD MULTIPLE pBOARD OF CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S IT'S SUCH AS I POINT OUT THE REASON I'M DOING THIS BILL. IS NOT JUST TO STAMP OUT THE BAD ACTORS THIS RESULT OF THE BAD ACTORS WE HAVE SCHOOLS LIKE CENTER MINE MENTIONED HE HAS ONE THAT IT'S ONLY. 70% VACCINATED WE THERE'S A SCHOOL THEIR SCHOOLS ARE AS LOW AS 50% YOU KNOW THE LA TIMES DOCUMENT NUMEROUS SCHOOLS THAT HAD MEDICAL EXEMPTION RATES ABOVE SO THAT MEANS IN THE OUTBREAKS OR ANYTHING IN THE SCHOOLS WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR ONE SOME DAY I MEAN THAT ACTUALLY ONE WHAT HAPPENED I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S WHAT WILL HAPPEN. I MEAN THAT THAT'S WHAT WE DO IS OUR MITCHELL SAID WE DO THIS FOR PREVENTION ONCE THE OUTBREAK HAPPENS IT'S HARD TO CATCH UP AND I THINK CERTAINLY A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICE CAN TALK ABOUT THE EXPENSE TO THE TAXPAYER. WHEN AN OUTBREAK HAPPENS AND WE TRY TO TRACE PEOPLE AND HAVE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONTAIN IT AND THE DAMAGE IS DONE WE WANT TO TRY TO PREVENT THE DAMAGE NOT WAIT TILL IT HAPPENS -- I THINK TOO OFTEN WE DO THAT AND GOVERNMENT WE WAIT TILL SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING THIS ARE THESE RATES GOING DOWN I HAVE DATA HERE THAT SAYS THEY'VE GONE FROM TWO POINT 7% TO FOUR POINT. THE MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS OF MORE TROUBLE THEY USED TO BE POINT TO THEIR OVER WENT UP TO POINT. SEVEN THAT'S WHAT THE MEDICAL EXEMPTION RATE HAS GONE UP THE OVERALL VACCINATION RATE. IN THE STATE BECAUSE A TWO SEVEN SEVEN HAS GONE UP SO SU SEVEN SAYS BEEN X. S. SUCCESS BUT THE PROBLEM IS IT'S NOT THE STATE WIDE RATE THAT MATTERS. IS THE RATE IN PARTICULAR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES AND WHEN YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU HAVE SCHOOLS OF VACCINATION RATES AND THE SEVENTY FIRST CENTS 50% 80%. THAT'S WAY TOO LOW YOU GONNA YOU'RE EXPECTING AN OUTBREAK SOMEONE'S GOING TO TRAVEL OVERSEAS AT ON A VACATION OR SOMETHING TO ENGLAND ARE TO ITALY ARE TO FRANCE -- TO PHILIPPINES AND COME BACK AND BRING MEASLES AND SUDDENLY -- SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE THAT AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THOSE% PEOPLE BY THE WAY YOUR INFECTIOUS FOR FOUR DAYS BEFORE YOU HAVE ANY SYMPTOMS YOU DON'T KNOW. RIGHT SO NOW YOU HAVE PEOPLE GOING AROUND TRAVELING -- TRAVELING OF MEETING WITH FRIENDS -- YOU'LL BE TENDING BIRTHDAY PARTIES WRITING A PUBLIC TRANSIT POTENTIALLY AL SPREADING THE DISEASE AROUND FOR THE FAMILY GET THE SYMPTOMS AND SAUCES -- BOY THAT'S MEASLES -- AND THEN TRIES TO STOP IT PUBLIC HEALTH IS GOING HAVING TO GO BACK AND ASK FOR HAVE YOU BEEN FOR THE LAST YOU KNOW FOR SIX DAYS A TO AND AND TRY TO CONTACT ALL THIS PEOPLE SAY OKAY NOW YOU HAVE TO STAY HOME BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT. THE YOUR INFECTIOUS NOW YOU HAVE TO STAY HOME AND TO TELL US IF YOU GOT AN INFECTION AND ON AND ON AND ON IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S SO TALKING ABOUT TAKING AWAY PEOPLE'S FREEDOM. THAT'S WHEN PEOPLE'S FREEDOM GET TAKEN AWAY RIGHT WHEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH ASSN INTERVENE TO TRY TO CONTAIN THE INFECTION PREVENT IT FROM SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT. I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AGAIN MY SO MY LAST QUESTION IS IS IT ON ON APRIL FIRST THERE WAS -- SENATE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE HEARING. WHERE YOU MADE THE STATEMENT THAT IT WASN'T RIGHT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TRIP -- TO LEGISLATE THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE -- IS AT WORK BUT IS THAT WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS LEGISLATING THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE NO OKAY THOUGH BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS FOR GRANTING MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS A PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTION. THE PRIDE IT'S NOT DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT THIS. DECISION TO GRANT A MEDICAL EXEMPTION IS REALLY A FUNCTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- THE MEDICAL-EXEMPTION IS TO THE STATE'S PLEA TO KEEPS TO TO ALLOW CHILDREN. WHO HAVE A CONDITION? SO IT'S STILL ATTEND SCHOOL IN A WAY TO KEEP THEM SAFE. THIS IS ABOUT SAFETY RIGHT AND SO THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE FRAUD GENTLY. RIGHT MEDICAL CENTERS ARE NOT DOING IT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PATIENT TO DOING FOR THEIR OWN BENEFIT THEY'RE THEY'RE ACTUALLY UNDERMINING. THE SAFETY OF THE SCHOOLS FOR THE PEOPLE WHO GENUINELY NEED THE MEDICAL EXCEPTION AND THAT'S WHY THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY IS THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. IT'S THE CMA IT'S THE AMERICAN CAVEAT GET A DOCTOR'S THE ONE TO REPRESENT THE FEVER THE POSITIONS OF THE STATE THAT SAY WE NEED THIS. THIS PARTICULAR BILL THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WOULD HAVE -- PULLED LICENSES FROM PHYSICIANS THAT WERE BAD ACTORS. THIS BILL NO THIS BILL THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WERE YOU SAID WE SHOULD LEGISLATE STUFF LIKE THAT. SO I GUESS I JUST THAT'S A LITTLE GOES A RIVET I MEAN WHAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THAT THAT CASE THAT'S ABOUT REMOVING LICENSES FROM THE PHYSICIANS RIGHT WELL I THINK THOSE PEOPLE THAT -- YOU'RE REFERENCING BEHIND YOU THAT WERE SELLING -- FALLS -- MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS SHOULD GET THEIR LICENSE THREE RIGHT WELL. I I I WOULD I WOULD AGREE BUT I THINK AGAIN THE IN TALKING TO THE I MEAN I WORK WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD. AND WITH THE PART OF THE CELTS AND PEOPLE FEEL THAT THIS APPROACH IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE APPROACH TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM THANK YOU YES SIR [inaudible] THIS [inaudible] BILL. CROATIAN YOU NEED TO PUSH YOUR MICROPHONE RIGHT THIS BILL HAS COME INTO QUESTION BECAUSE DOCTOR PAN KEEP STATING THAT. THERE IS THESE ALLEGED YOU KNOW FRONT FRAUDULENT CASES HERE. IN PEDIATRICS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IN NOVEMBER THIS HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED. IT WAS PUBLISHED AT MOST PARTICIPANT REPORTED. SEEN FEW OR NO MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS THAT THE BELIEVE FOR PROBLEMATIC THIS IS BEEN PUBLISHED IN PEDIATRICS IS AT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD THAT SAYS THIS WAS AT AM STANCE IMAGES THAT HHS PUBLIC ACCESS BONNIE IT EXPERIENCE AS A MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS FALLING THE ELIMINATION OF THEIR OF NON MEDICAL VACCINE. EXEMPTIONS IN CALIFORNIA. IN ADDITION. RIGHT OVER HERE THESE ARE THE CONCLUSIONS FACED THAT HAD BEEN PUBLISHED -- THAT. THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL BOARD HAS RECEIVED SIXTY COMPLAINTS REGARDING MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SB. TWO SEVEN SEVEN THE MAJORITY OF THE CASES HAVE BEEN CLOSE. DUE TO NON VIOLATIONS BEING FOUND. INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE BEING NO PURSUE DISAPPEARING ACTION OR INABILITY TO PERCY DUE TO THE LACK OF SUPPORTING EVIDENCE. WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO BEING ABLE TO SUBPOENA THERE THE MEDICAL BOARD CAN AND ANYTIME SUBPOENA? ANY MEDICAL CHART. DOES HAPPEN WITH DR SEARS AS WE KNOW AS NOON TODAY HAVE GOTTEN TAKEN SEVERAL OF HIS. CHARTS SO THERE IS A PROCESS TO THERE'S A DUE PROCESS IN PLANES IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE ANYTHING. THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO. PROVING CASES OF MEDICAL FRAUDULENT WITH REGARDS TO SO. SUPPOSE IT SALES OF VACCINES THEY'RE EASY TO DO PROCESS HERE BANG ON SO IF THE IF THIS IS THE REASON THIS HAS COME. INTO FRUITION SHOWS ONE CASE AT THIS MOMENT. THAT YOU KNOW THAT HAS BEEN THE CASE OKAY THANK ME YES MA'AM. I'D LIKE TO RESPOND -- CURRY PLAYERS I'M SORRY SIR DID YOU WANT TO RESPOND SENATOR PAN SO -- SO I WOULD SAY FIRST OF ALL AND TWO ZERO PRISON THAT'S THIS ITEM ON OUR SIDE ARTICLE WHICH ACTUALLY -- WORDS HE SURVEYED -- PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS WHO THEN DID REVIEW MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS THEIR D. INDEMNIFIED SO THE CONTENT OF BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GET INFORMATION WITH THE PATIENT'S NAME ON IT. AT WHAT THEY FOUND OTHER NUMEROUS CASES OF OF VERY -- SAYS THE SUSPECT MEDICAL EXEMPTION SO INTERESTING AFTER PULLING FROM A PAPER WHERE. THE SURVEY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS NAY SAID WELL ACTUALLY THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF REALLY -- SUSPICIOUS MEDICAL EXEMPTIONS AND WE HAVE CONCERNS THE PUBLIC HEALTH UP SAID WE HAVE CONCERNS AND THAT'S WHY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER HERE WE HAVE CONCERNS. THAT WE SEE THE ADVERTISEMENTS AND ALL THAT GOING ON AND WHAT YOU HEAR IS THAT FROM THE MEDICAL BOARD. AND I TALKED TO THE MEDICAL BOARD YES INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE THE PARENTS ARE COOPERATING WITH THEM THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO BE GIVEN ACCESS TO THE RECORDS THAT THEY NEED TO DO THE INVESTIGATION THAT'S WHY. THE MEDICAL BOARD CAN'T GO AFTER THESE -- DVDS -- PARTICULAR POSITIONS THANK YOU AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR YOUR INDULGENCE ON MY QUESTIONS AND AND MA'AM I WOULD HAVE LET YOU RESPOND BUT I HAVE TO LET THE SENATOR RESPOND. BEFORE YOU I POLITICS. OKAY SO -- BUT WE NEED TO GO -- TO SENATOR UNDER RAZA. THANK YOU IT'S IT'S MORE OF A COMMENT BUT YOU COULD TIE IT UP FOR ME -- IS YOU KNOW I'VE ALWAYS. I'VE BEEN AROUND AND GROWN UP IN COMMUNITIES THAT WERE TOO POOR TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH -- THE HEALTH COVERAGE YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO GET THE ATTENTION THAT THEY NEEDED. AND ALWAYS ANXIOUS TO BE ABLE TO GET. YOU KNOW THE PROTECTIONS AND WE'VE HAD. TO REALLY REALLY INVEST IN REACHING OUT AND PROVIDING. A PREVENTATIVE OF OF MEASURES TO HELP THEM -- AND SO IN SOME WAYS I'M REALLY. I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR THAT THERE ARE SO MANY FAMILIES THAT HAVE THAT ACCESS TO THE HEALTH CARE THAT THEY HAVE THE DOCTORS WHO ARE CARING FOR THEM AND FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S. I AM SO I'M TRYING TO SEE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN ALL OF THIS BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME IT CAN'T BE ONE OR THE OTHER IT CAN BE. YES WE WILL MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE OF VACCINATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY HOW MANY COUNTRIES. AROUND THE WORLD WOULD LOVE TO HAVE OUR RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF SOME FAMILIES AND SOME CHILDREN SO I GUESS YOU KNOW I'M TRYING TO SEE. WHERE ONE COMMUNITY? AND AND AND PEOPLE WE DON'T LIVE IN ISOLATION FROM EACH OTHER -- AND SO WE HAVE TO HAVE THIS CARE. FOR EACH OTHER. AND A SO I'M I'M TRYING. TO YOU KNOW REACH THAT AND I HEAR IT AND MAYBE YOU CAN SUMMARIZE THAT IN IN A WAY THAT MAKES MORE SENSE SO LET LET LT ME. GO BACK A LITTLE BIT HISTORY BECAUSE YOU'RE FROM LOS ANGELES -- THERE WAS A LARGE OUTBREAK OF MEASLES -- IN LOS ANGELES IN THE LATE EIGHTIES I THINK IT WENT ON FOR ALMOST A YEAR AND A HALF OR% TWO YEARS. THE FORTY OR ABLE TO CONTAIN AND THAT WAS BECAUSE AT THAT TIME -- WE DID NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO VACCINATIONS FOR LOW INCOME CHILDREN IN FACT AS A RESULT OF NOT ONLY THAT OPERATE BUT OTHER OUTBREAKS -- THE PROGRAM PASS VACCINES FOR CHILDRENPROGRAM THAT PROVIDED FREE VACCINATIONS THROUGH THE MEDICAID PROGRAM TO MEDI CAL HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TOO LOW INCOME CHILDREN -- SO -- SO THAT WAS THE PREVIOUS PROBLEM WE HAD WE SAID -- MEASLES OUTBREAKS THE PROBLEM WAS IS LOW INCOME CHILDREN WERE GETTING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE TO COULDN'T GET ACCESS TO VACCINATION RIGHT AND WE HAD THE THANK YOU VERY LARGE OUTBREAK IN IN LOS ANGELES -- I WAS ACTUALLY IS A MEDICAL STUDENT IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE PRESENT IN A OUTBREAK OF MEASLES AND PHILADELPHIA. IN THAT CASE -- THERE WERE A COUPLE OF I GUESS RELIGIOUS GROUPS THAT -- DIDN'T BELIEVE IN MEDICAL CARE AND SO THEY WEREN'T VACCINATED NEEDS OF THEIR ENDED UP THERE WERE LIKE NINE HUNDRED PEOPLE GOT MEASLES -- NINE CHILDREN DIED OKAY IT IS IS IS A TERRIBLE OUTBREAK. AND NOT THAT ANY PERSON DESERVE TO GET MEASLES BUT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT IN THE CITY AT THE TIME. HALF OF THE PEOPLE WERE MEMBERS OF OUR WAS SO SILLY AND WITH THOSE RELIGIOUS GROUPS THE OTHER HALF OR NOT BECAUSE YOU SAID WE'RE ALL ONE COMMUNITY. RIGHT AND ULTIMATELY I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT BECAUSE THESE ARE VERY CONTAGIOUS DISEASES THEY SPREAD. SO I TALKED ABOUT WELL BADGING YOU HAVE A SCHOOL THAT HAS LOW VACCINATION RATE SOMEONE BRINGS IN MEASLES THEY GO ON A TRIP OR SOMETHING COME BACK NOW IT. IS TRANSMITTED TO ALL THE OTHER KIDS IN THE SCHOOL BECAUSE BEFORE TO GET SYMPTOMS RIGHT AND THEN THOSE KIDS ARE ALL GOING OUT AND THEY'RE GOING HOME AND THEN TO GOING GROCERY SHOPPING WITH THEIR PARENTS ETCETERA. THEN WHAT HAPPENS YOU HAVE A HUGE OUTBREAK BECAUSE BASICALLY THE LOW VACCINATION RATES AS I MENTIONED MY AN OPENING IS LIKE TO TENDER FOR A WHAT YOU KNOW OUTBREAK WILD FIRE. RIGHT SO THEY COULD DO WANT TO GET BECAUSE PICKS UP STEAM AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN PHILADELPHIA AND THAT'S ALSO WHAT HAPPENED LOS ANGELES AND WHEN HE PICKS UP STEAM IT'S REALLY HARD TO CONTAIN. BECAUSE THIS THING JUST SPREADS RAPIDLY SO YOU WANT IS YOU WANT STANFORD OUT RIGHT WAIT JUST LIKE OF WILD FIRE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN THE FLAME IS SMALL BECAUSE I TIME IT'S RUSSIAN UP THE HILL. AND IT'S BURNING THE BIG TREES RIGHT THE IT'S REALLY HARD TO STOP AND THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO TAKE THE STEPS TO BE SURE WE DON'T HAVE THESE POCKETS OF LOW VACCINATION. THAT THEN BECOME THE TENDER TO LEAD TO THE FUEL IT OUTBREAK THAT TENDS GONNA TAKE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT TO STOP AND MORE IMPORTANTLY IS GOING TO SECOND AND POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW HOT WILL CERTAINLY HOSPITALIZED MEUSEL HOPLITES OUT ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE. AND MAYBE EVEN KILL SOMEONE WE'RE FORTUNATE SO FAR NO ONE HAS DIED OF WELL LET'S SEE WE'VE HAD A COUPLE PEOPLE DIED OF MEASLES IN THE LAST SINCE. TWENTY TWO THOUSAND BUT YOU KNOW THANKS TO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY BEING VERY AGGRESSIVE ABOUT TREATING PEOPLE WE FORTUNATELY NOT HAD. OTHER DEATHS BUT I BUT I CAN'T GUARANTEE THAT WON'T HAPPEN. I WOULD HAVE TO BY THE WAY SEVENTY EIGHTY DEBTS AND IN EUROPE LAST YEAR FOR MEASLES. DID YOU WANT TO SEND RUBIO. AND I KNOW THIRTY BEEN A LONG DAY SO TRY AND SPEAK FAST AND KEEP IT SHORT BUT FOR SO I JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE OF THE PARENTS AND EVERYONE THAT'S HERE. SPEAKING EITHER IN ALL FOR IT OR AGAINST IT I KNOW IT'S A YOU KNOW PEOPLE COME FROM FAR AWAY SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE VALIDATE YOU KNOW EVERYONE THAT'S HERE AND THEY'RE CONCERNED SO. I JUST HAVE TO VERIFICATION QUESTIONS AND I AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE SAID SO MUCH THROUGHOUT THE BEES HOURS BUT FOR ME THERE'S SOMETHING THAT I KIND OF MISS DAN DI CAN YOU CLARIFY FOR ME -- HOW HOW DO YOU HANDLE THE SITUATION WHEN THERE'S A FAMILY THAT ALREADY HAS A HISTORY OF? OF VACCINE INJURY LIKE HOW DO YOU PROCEED IN TERMS OF THEIR CHILD THE NEXT GENERATION IS THERE SOMETHING ALSO CERTAINLY DEPENDS -- IT DEPENDS ON THE SO FIRST OF ALL YOU'VE HEARD SOME PEOPLE SAY THE CHILD IS A VACCINE ENTRY INTO MENTIONED THAT THAT'S AUTISM AND UNFORTUNATELY. THE EVIDENCE IS NOT THE OF THE EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT AUTISM IS NOT REALLY TO VACCINES SO WE I THINK WE HAVE TO SEPARATE -- THINGS THAT ARE ACTUALLY RELATE TO VACCINES FROM THINGS THAT MAY NOT BE -- THAT'S BASED ON THE EVIDENCE -- THE THE OTHER THING I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE DO HAVE WE DO THERE IS EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND CONSUMING MONITORING OF VACCINATIONS VACCINES ARE MOST DOLLY EVALUATED BEFORE APPROVAL THERE'S CONSTANT MONITORING AFTERWARDS THERE'S THESE -- BASS VACCINE DATA SAFETY LINK THEIR MONITORING TO OBSERVE LOOKING AT RECORDS THROUGH -- LARGE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE KAISER SO FOR LOOKING FOR ANY POSSIBLE PATTERN OF ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE RELATED TO THAT TWO TWO VACCINES AND THAT'S WHAT GOES INTO THESE GUIDELINES IN THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS SO. CERTAINLY WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT ANY CHILD WHO ARE THERE'S EVEN A HINT OF A POTENTIAL RISK THAT MIGHT OCCUR BECAUSE OF ACTS VACCINATION THAT WE SEE ANY. CHANCE OF THAT THAT -- WE WOULD PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY -- FOR FOR THEM. ONE IMAGES -- BETTER BECAUSE I HEARD A LOT OF PARENTS COME UP FOR THEMSELVES AND HE SAID YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE ADULTS THEY SAID I'D HAVE BEEN VACCINE INJURED AND THEY HAVE TWO CHILDREN SAYING. THAT THAT ON A VACCINATE SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW LIKE TO DOCTORS TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION CREATIONISTS THAT PERTAINS TO THE CHILDREN OF PEOPLE. IN ADULTS THAT ALREADY HAVE THAT EVIDENCE CERTAINLY IF THERE'S SOME IF THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONNECTION THERE THAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD -- BE TAKEN THAT CERTAINLY STAKING ACCOUNT LOOKING AT THE RESEARCH FOR EXAMPLE -- YOU KNOW PEOPLE EVEN BY THE WAY THEY DIDN'T STUDY. AUTISM RATES IN. CHILDREN AND SIBLINGS OF A FAMILIES THAT THEY HAVE OR HAVE AN AUTISTIC CHILDREN AND RELATE TO VACCINES AND FOUNDERS AGAIN NO CONNECTION BETWEEN VACCINES AND AUTISM -- SO EVEN IN THE SIBLINGS OF CHILDREN WHO HAVE AUTISM THE STUDY THAT SAID WELL MAYBE THEY MIGHT BE AT HIGHER RISK. FOR AUTISM RELATED TO VACCINES AND TURNS OUT THERE WAS NO ATTRACTION SO I MEAN THESE THINGS ARE BEING EXTENSIVELY STUDIED. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I ALSO APPRECIATE -- I KNOW I HAD A CONCERN ABOUT AND WE SPOKE ABOUT THE APPEAL PROCESS YOU'LL PARENTS NOT. A FEELING THAT THEY WERE GOING TO BE HEARD AND SO CAN YOU JUST EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT WILL HAVE WHAT THT PROCESS LOOKS LIKE -- SO SO BASICALLY -- YES I'M SORRY -- SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS IS THAT NGUYEN IF THE APPLICATION IS REJECTED THREE BILLION OPPORTUNITIES POSITION TO PROVIDE. LOOK AT THE REASON PROJECTION AND IT'S IT'S FRIED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- PERHAPS IT DID THE DAY FELT THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER DID NOT GET. THE FULL PICTURE OF THE ITEM AS YOU SENATE INITIAL ONE RIGHT AND YOU GO I THINK I PROVIDE ENOUGH INFORMATION AND THEN THEY'RE LIKE WELL MAYBE. AND IN VERSES THAT WILL KNOW AT BECAUSE ITAND SAID WELL ACTUALLY DIDN'T REALIZE ABOUT THIS SO I MEAN WE WANT TO GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY. AS AN OPPORTUNITY -- FOR TO BE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER HAS THE FULL PICTURE AND THE IN TERMS OF THE VALUATION AND WE DON'T WANT SOMEONE TO BE DENIED A MEDICAL EXEMPTION WHO MIGHT POSSIBLY ACTUALLY. NEED ONE SO WE WANT FOR A TREAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. AND AND I KNOW I'VE HEARD IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN ABOUT LIKE THE PATIENT AND FAMILY RELATIONSHIP BUT AT ANY GIVEN. TIME A DOCTOR COULD INTERCEDE IN THAT APPEAL PROCESSES AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR EVEN WRITTEN TESTIMONY OR EVEN PERSONAL TESTIMONY THEY CAN DO THAT RIGHT YES WELL THEY THEY WOULD PROVIDE IDEA OF DID MANAGE OF WRITING THINGS I THINK IN WRITING OR ELECTRONICALLY. THAT TO TO THE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT BUT I MEAN I A DAY IN THE ACTUAL INVITATION WE CAN CERTAINLY I MEAN I DIDN'T WRITE IT INTO THE BILL BUT I'M SURE WE CAN HAVE THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT ALSO THE PERSON MUST CALL UP AND TALK OVER. THAT MIGHT BE ANOTHER OPTION AS WELL I CAN'T THINK OF IT I WAS JUST CONCERNED WERE AND HE THOUGHT IT PERSONAL MEDICAL DOCTOR THAT HAS THE PATIENT RELATIONSHIP COULD THEMSELVES AS MUCH AS THE PARENTS SO MANY BUT THEY COULD ALSO BE PART OF THAT PROCESS. YES YES THEY ARE PART OF THE PROCESS THANK YOU I'M ALSO I I YOU KNOW I WAS CONCERNED WITH THAT YOU KNOW THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE ALL FAMILIES AND THEIR YOU KNOW PERSONAL RIGHTS BUT DID I HEAR CORRECTLY THAT THAT'S ALREADY BEEN CHALLENGED IN COURT SEVERAL TIMES. AS YOU KNOW THEY HAVEN'T BEEN SUCCESSFUL RIGHT SIR SB TWO SEVEN SEVEN HAS BEEN -- CHALLENGING QUITE THINK FOUR TIMES I DON'T KNOW THERE'S A DRIVERS FOR FIVE BUT IT AND WE'VE. WON BASICALLY -- IS ONE HELL OF HELD IN ALL THOSE CASES SO IT THERE'S AN APPELLATE COURT RULING A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC COURT RECENT CHALLENGE BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS. AND IT'S BEEN UP HELD. THANK YOU AND TO MY LAST QUESTION IN THE ARMY BUT HE'S. ALSO PIVACY IS A BIG CONCERN RIGHT AND DIE AND I ALSO KNOW THAT FOR A YEAR I HEARD YOU SAY THAT THE INFORMATION GOES TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. WHERE THEY KEEP TRACK OF ALL THE CHILDREN HAVE BEEN -- GIVEN EXEMPTIONS AND BY WAY OF THAT THEY'RE ABLE. TO PICK OUT MAYBE A PATTERN AND SEE WHAT DOCTORS ARE BEING AN ETHICAL BUT JUST. THAT'S NOT MY QUESTION I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE PRIVACY ISSUE LIKE WHAT SAFEGUARDS FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF PROTECTING FAMILY INFORMATION SO -- POINT OUT THAT THE FIRST OF ALL THIS BILL DOES EXPLICITLY SAY. AND IT'S ALSO IMPLICIT THAT THE THE THAT -- ALL HELP A AND TO BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE AND AND STATE PRIDE MEDICAL HEALTH PRIVACY LAWS HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED -- SO THAT'S ACTUALLY EXPLICITLY IN THE BILL -- HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE BOUND BY SO THERE ARE -- IN HIP BUT THERE ARE. YOU HAD THIS PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO HAVE ACCESS TO PATIENT DATA OF COURSE THEY HAVE TO KEEP IT CONFIDENTIAL THEY CAN'T LIKE JUST BY THE WAY THAT'S WHY SOMETIMES WHEN YOU SEE THERE'S A REPORT ABOUT. A MEASLES OUTBREAK IN YOU GO WELL AS CHILD BACKS NEAR NOT THEY DON'T SAY ANYTHING IT'S BECAUSE BUT THAT WAS BECAUSE OF HIP BUT THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE. TO REVEAL -- ACCESS PRIVATE THAT COULD BE PRIVATE HEALTH INFORMATION UNLESS THE FAMILY ALLOWS IT TO BE REVEALED SO -- SO BASICALLY HELP OF FLIES AND AND THAT THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT IS. IS ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE UNDER LAW TO KEEP THIS INFORMATION PRIVATE -- THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE PUBLICLY -- DISSEMINATING THAT INFORMATION -- ITS ACT ACTUALLY FOR EXEMPTION FOR EXAMPLE THE HEALTH OF OUR DANCE EXEMPTION THAT EXEMPTION WOULD GO TO THE PHYSICIAN WHO HANDED TO THE PATIENT WHO THEN GIVE IT TO THE SCHOOL IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE JUST GOING TO GO AND PUT A PUBLIC POSTER BOARD SAY WELL THESE ARE ALL. THE CHILDREN GOT EXEMPTIONS. OTHER OUT OF THE SAME GENDER AS ANY MEDICAL DOCTOR ANY YES YEAH THERE ARE STANDARDS THEIR HELL TO UNDER FEDERAL AND STATE LAW. OKAY THANK YOU FOR ANSWER MY QUESTIONS REALLY APPRECIATED. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL YOU HAD A FOLLOW UP LAUGHS LAUGHS LAUGHS I PROMISE MISTER VICE CHAIR -- AUTISM A FIVE BECAUSE I'VE I'VE HEARD YOU VERY CLEAR -- ARE THERE ANY OTHER IT OUT AND I'M CLEAR THAT THIS IS A LIST OF REACTIONS. AND SO ARE THERE ANY OTHER -- REACTIONS THAT A PARENT MAY HAVE OR SUFFER. THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A CONCERN FOR WOULD LIKELY MEET THE CRITERIA OF YOUR OF YOUR CURRENT LEGISLATION IN TERMS OF EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT CHILD THEREFORE BE WITH BECAUSE WE HEARD LOTS OF OF FAMILIAL -- WHAT'S THE WORD I'M STRUGGLING -- FOR COMPROMISED. EXPERIENCES WITH VACCINES I'VE HAD ONE CHILD OR TWO CHILDREN. MULTIPLE GENERATION WE HEARD A LOT OF THAT IN THE TESTIMONY STILL STICKING AUTISM OFF THE TABLE -- ARE THERE ANY OTHERS THAT THERE WOULD BE A CONCERN SO THE MAIN -- SO FIRST OF ALL THE MOST FREQUENT VACCINE REACTION. IS THIS SOME SORT OF ALLERGIC REACTION ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY FAMILIAL SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU HAVE ONE CHILD IS ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS DOESN'T MEAN THAT. ALL YOUR OTHER CHILDREN ARE RIGHT -- THERE ALSO BE IMMUNO COMPROMISED AND DEPENDS ON THE REASON FOR THAT SO VISITS TO YOUR IMMUNO COMPROMISED BECAUSE OF A GENETIC PROBLEM THEN OF COURSE THEN THAT MAY BE A SITUATION WHERE WE WOULD SAY. WE WOULD HAVE TO SAY WELL LET'S NOT. LET'S CHECK THE CHILD'S IMMUNE SYSTEM FIRST BEFORE WE WOULD DO THAT SO THERE THERE COULD BE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THAT THAT REGARD YES DEL FIVE YOU THE MOST LIKELY SITUATION GOT IT GOT AND I JUST WANTED. TO SAY ALSO MY COLLEAGUE YOU KNOW REFERENCE THIS YOUNG MAN WHO SAT FEARING HANDLE HIS BUSINESS DURING THIS SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND OUR HEARINGS LIKED IT MIGHT OUT TO YOU YES AND ALL THE OTHER YOUNG PEOPLE AND CHILDREN -- IN THE AUDIENCE I TIP MY HAT -- YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HAVE A RE HAVING A REACTION. TO THIS IS A CONCERN ABOUT A POTENTIAL. AUTO IMMUNE CONDITION THAT WOULD PREVENT SOMEONE FROM BEING -- IMMUNIZED IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SO AS WE TALK ABOUT WHAT CHILD SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT OVER THE OTHER TO GO TO PUBLIC SCHOOL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT POPULATIONS SOMEONE WHO HAD A UNFORTUNATE REACTION. VERSUS SOMEONE WHO HAS A POTENTIAL AUTO IMMUNE CONDITION OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THEY NOT BE IMMUNIZED IN THE FIRST PLACE FIRST. THAT'S WHERE I STARTED MY QUESTION REALLY TRYING TO GET THAT CLEAR DISTINCTION AND LET ME JUST SAY OF MADAME MR CHERRY BUT DOING A FABULOUS JOB I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS IS NOT WAVING. I SEE THAT WE'VE LOST OUR TRANSLATORS BUT THIS IS AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE FOR APPLAUSE SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT IT IS WE'RE DOING IS NOT WAVING. IT'S A PLUS TO A A SALE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER MONNING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAVE A FINAL QUESTION BASED ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PRESENTED TO US -- THAT UNDERSTAND YOU'VE ACCEPTED THE PROPOSED AMENDMENT ACT YES. THERE'S ONE IT PAGE TWO IN BOLD TALKING ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT IN CONSULTATION WITH LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS SHALL DEVELOP A PROCESS BY WHICH A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. CAN BE REQUESTED BY A PARENT OR GUARDIAN IN THE DEPARTMENT CAN APPROVE OR DENY THE REQUEST. EXPEDITIOUSLY AND COMMUNICATE THAT DECISION IN A TIMELY FASHION TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HIM PARENT OR GUARDIAN. QUOTES THE INTERPRETATION OF EXPEDITIOUSLY AND TIMELY FASHION. AND WHAT'S THE CAPACITY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO ACT EXPEDITIOUSLY AND IN A TIMELY FASHION SO WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT -- THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT IS THINKING ADVANCE DEVELOPING MECHANISMS TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE -- A MEDICAL EXEMPTION TO THE SCHOOLS. RECOGNIZING BY THE WAY THERE'S PRIVACY ISSUES SO THAT'S WHY. IT'S NOT JUST LIKE YOU CAN GO AND BLASTED OUT TO THIS THE SCHOOL DIRECTLY NECESSARILY YOU KNOW YOU THE PARENTS NEED TO BE IN THE LOOP SO FORTH AND AFTER ALL WE NEED TO KNOW WHICH SCHOOL THEY'RE GOING FOR BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU GOT A MEDICAL EXEMPTION LET'S. SAY WHEN YOUR CHILD'S FAIRLY YOUNG YOU MAY NOT KNOW WHAT SCHOOL THEY'RE GOING TO SO THE TOP HEALTH CRISIS WILL YOU HAVE A MEDICAL EXEMPTION IN THIS THE MEDICAL ATTENTION ISN'T SCHOOL SPECIFIC BY THE WAY MEDICAL EXAMS AS A MEDICAL EXEMPTION. IT'S TO THE STATE INDIVIDUATED INDIVIDUAL SO WE WE WANT BUT WE WANT THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT THANK IN ADVANCE BECAUSE THERE MAY BE SITUATIONS WHERE SOMEONE WAITED TILL THE LAST MINUTE WE DON'T WANT CHILDREN IN THE SCHOOL. SO WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S THINKING AT THE PUMP. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH WORKING WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THINKING ABOUT OTHER PRIVACY LAWS AND OTHER TYPES OF MECHANISMS WE HAVE TO BE SURE WE HONOR TO BE SURE WE CAN COMMUNICATE. AS AFFECTED AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN A WAY THAT HONORS ALL THE FISH OTHER ISSUES BUT ALSO BE SURE TO ENSURE IS THAT. OUR CHILDREN CAN ATTEND SCHOOL IN THE TIE IN ON TIME SO WOULD THERE BE A MECHANISM TO PRIORITIZE THOSE. APPLICATIONS -- REQUESTS FROM SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. SO THAT THE TASTING -- WE ONLY WANT YET THAT'S THAT'S POTENTIALLY -- DID SOMETHING THAT -- HEALTH THE THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT THAT MIGHT MAY DO RIGHT SO SOMEONE IS APPROACHING SCHOOL LATER IN IN SCHOOL READY IN MY FEARS IF WE LEAVE THIS LANGUAGE EXPEDITIOUSLY TIMELY FASHION. IT'S TOO VAGUE SO AS THINGS MOVE FORWARD TO HAVE SOME TARGETS MAY BE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES SCHOOL AGE KIDS -- THE TURNAROUND IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE. TO FIND OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I APPRECIATE THAT AND WE WILL CERTAINLY WANT TO WORK WITH THAT THE PART OF THE CALL TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S A A SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE -- BOTH YEAH. MEET YOUR GOALS AND AND AND AND AND AND WORKABLE SO THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IS ARE YOUR QUESTIONS. IF NOT -- DOCTOR PAN IF YOU LIKE CLOSE. SO I'M FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO FOR SO I'M A THANK YOU -- THRICE CHAIR FOR EXCELLENT JOB -- CHAIRING AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT I ACTUALLY WHAT I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PEOPLE WHO TESTIFIED HERE SO ALL PEOPLE I MEAN I KNOW WE SAT AND WE LISTEN FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND IT. REALLY THANK PEOPLE TO FOR THEIR INTEREST IN COMING DOWN HERE AND AND AND EXPRESSING THEIR THEIR THOUGHTS ABOUT THIS BILL. EVEN AS WE WERE -- HEARING THAT TESTIMONY UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH AT THREE PM TODAY THE CDC IS NOW INDICATED THAT WE HAVE NOW EXCEEDED THE HIGHEST NUMBER ON RECORD IN A SINGLE YEAR OF DIZZY HAVE MEASLES CENTERS ELIMINATED. TWO THOUSAND THAT HAPPENED WHILE E WERE HERE LISTENING TO THIS TESTIMONY I THINK IT IT INDICATES THE URGENCY. OF US ACTING WE DID ACT BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN PASSING TWO SEVEN SEVEN THAT IS HELPING US LIMóN OUTBREAKS BUT WE NEED TO BE SURE WE TAKE THIS NEXT STEP. TO BE SURE WE CONTINUE TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA SB TWO SEVENTY SIX I I I I URGE YOUR I THOUGHT THANK YOU -- THIS IS -- DO PASSED -- TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS. AS AMENDED LAND OVERLOOKING PROMOTION I'M SORRY. SO -- BY CENTERED AROUND SO -- AGAIN AMENDED THAT TO APPROPRIATIONS -- PLEASE CALL WORLD. PAN HI CAN I STONE NO STONE NO DURAZO. DRAWS A I GROWTH.

TO MOVE OUT OF COMMITTEE AND THAT GOES TO APPROPRIATIONS I THINK OF A HOLDING THE ROLE FOR THE OPEN AND WE'RE GONNA HOLD THE ROLE FOR THE OPENING OF THE ABSENT MEMBERS ARE. SIXTY TO SIXTY TWO WE'RE GONNA TAKE A FIVE MINUTE RECESS TO ALLOW -- OUR GUESTS. TO LEAVE AND I THINK THEY FOR YOUR ALL YOUR PATIENCE NINE ONE OF THOSE EIGHTEEN DEL STEP PLEASE THAT. MOVE OUT OF THE HEARING ROOM AND TAKE YOUR CONVERSATIONS OUTSIDE THANK YOU ACTUALLY IF I CAN ASK THE S. SERGEANTS TO HELP GUIDE PEOPLE OUT OF THE ROOM I A IT IT'S I KNOW YOU I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HERE WITH US THE WHOLE TIED TO THE NEEDS. OF THE TIRED AS WELL OKAY. SO I T. A. C. CENTER SINCE WE GOT FARSI CENTER BILL HERE SO THE SENATE BILL WOULD YOU LIKE TO APPROACH THE PODIUM AND BRING UP YOUR WITNESSES FOR ITEM NUMBER TWO SP. ELEVEN GO AHEAD GET EVERYONE READY HERE [inaudible] THERE ARE. SO IT'S A PEOPLE ARE COMING UP AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE LEAVING THE ROOM I A AS I'M SURE THE MEMBERS OF MY COMMITTEE WE DO NOT NEED A REMINDER APART REMIND ME. IT IS NOW 717- PM -- AND WE ARE WE HAVE COMPLETED JUST THREE ITEMS ON OUR AGENDA -- SO. I HOPE. WELL I CERTAINLY DO NOT WANT TO SHORT SHRIFT ANYBODY'S PRESENTATION OR THAT TESTIMONY I ALSO HOPE THAT PEOPLE KEEP IN MIND. THE OF BREVITY AND BEING TO THE POINT IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED -- BY THE COMMITTEE. SO WITH THAT. EVERYONE READY OKAY. SO I'M OKAY SPENCER BELTZ SO WITH THAT ITEM NUMBER TWO SB. ELEVEN WELCOME. AND THANK YOU FOR WAITING FOR HER. THE PREVIOUS BILL ALL RIGHT WEEKS OR MONTHS WHEN THEY SEEK HELP FOR MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS UNACCEPTABLE. TODAY -- I WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR ON OUR AMENDMENTS WE HAVE A MEMBERS WE ARE GIVING TO YOU. WE ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND NARROW THE PARITY REPORTING PORTIONS OF THE BILL. NOW AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE MOCK UP IN FRONT OF YOU THERE'S IS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION TO SB ELEVEN SO WE'RE ACCEPTING -- THOSE REPORTING PORTIONS -- I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WILL COME BACK LATER -- IN THIS SESSION PROBABLY NEXT YEAR OR MAYBE BEFORE THEN -- ON THIS ISSUE -- THE AREA THAT -- WE PREFER NOT TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS -- SUGGESTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. ARE THE ONES THAT WOULD RESTRICT. ACCESS TO LIFE. SAVING MEDICATION. THIS IS THE TREATMENT AND WE BELIEVE THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT TO WATER DOWN SO. WE HAVE THEM -- WITNESSES EXPLAIN THAT TO YOU -- SO WE ARE ACCEPTING PART OF THE AMENDMENTS BUT NOT OTHER PARTS. ADDICTION IS KILLING COUNTLESS PEOPLE OVERDOSE AND SUICIDE RATES ARE RISING. CALIFORNIA JONES ARE PLACED IN FOSTER CARE. THAT IN THEM IS AMAZING RATE -- RIGHT NOW AND THEY'RE BORN ADDICTED OR FACING LIFELONG HEALTH STRUGGLES BECAUSE THEY FEEL TO HELP -- WOULD BECAUSE WE FAILED TO HELP THEIR PARENTS AND WE HAVE KNOWN WE'VE ALL KNOWN SOMEBODY THAT HAS -- SOME FORM OF ADDICTION AND TRY TO GET HELP AND HAD TO WAIT FILL -- BECAUSE OF BARRIERS TO TREATMENT. I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE MEDICAID IS ASSISTED TREATMENT PART MEDICAID ASSISTANT TREATMENT WORKS -- PATIENTS GO WITHOUT TREATMENT BECAUSE OF PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. STEP THERAPY -- REQUIREMENTS MEDICAL NECESSITY REQUIREMENTS. AND OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTUALLY ISSUED A STATEMENT IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR SAID THAT NEARLY 90% OF THE PATIENTS IN THE NEED OF ADDICTION TREATMENT. SERVICES DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO TREATMENT -- ONE IN TEN ONLY THESE HURDLES KILL PEOPLE. WHEN A PERSON HAS TO WAIT THEY WILL USUALLY FAIL? WHEN A PERSON STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION -- IS WILLING TO WORK WITH THEIR DOCTOR. AND TRIED MEDICATION WE NEED TO JUMP AT THE CHANCE WE CAN'T WAIT. SB ELEVEN REQUIRES PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO PROVIDE PRESCRIBE TREATMENT. FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE TO SOARED WITHOUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. OR STEP THERAPY WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO FILL FIRST. AND WE WANT DOCTORS TO HAVE AN ABILITY TO GIVE PATIENTS A REAL SHOT AT RECOVERY. NOW JUST IN THE PAST COUPLE MONTHS -- AND I'M ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS KENTUCKY VERMONT IN YOUR TO PASS LEGISLATION. UNANIMOUSLY TO REMOVE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION BARRIERS CALIFORNIA SHOULD ALSO BE A LEADER. AND ARCHER BOURBON ANALYSIS ON SB ELEVEN SAID OVER THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE WILL GAIN ACCESS TO TREATMENT -- FOR APPEARED DISORDERS AND TWENTY TWO HUNDRED WILL GAIN ACCESS FOR ALCOHOL TREATMENT. THIS BENEFIT WILL NOT JUST -- WILL NOT JUST BENEFIT INDIVIDUALS BUT THE WHOLE STATE. AND THE FAMILIES OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AS WE SEE A DECREASE IN SOCIAL COSTS OF UNTREATED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. TURNED ON MY WITNESSES -- MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU WITNESSES SUPPORT. YOU HAVE SIX MINUTES TOTAL BE AND HOW ME WITNESSES WE HAVE HERE -- I THINK WE HAVE -- THREE OKAY SO YEAH EXCELLENT GUILLORY SURE THANK YOU -- MY NAME'S DAVID LLOYD I'M A SENIOR POLICY ADVISER WITH THE KENNEDY FORM WHICH THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOUNDED BY FORMER CONGRESSMAN PATRICK KENNEDY -- UP TOWARD A MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION ISSUES SO WE'RE WE'RE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF SB ALIVE AND HOW PARTICULAR THE S. THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER -- MEDICATION PROVISIONS WE BELIEVE THAT THIS. THIS IMPORTANT -- LEGISLATION WILL SAVE LIVES AND LAST IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NEARLY TWENTY TWO HUNDRED CALIFORNIANS ARE DIED OF APPEARED OVERDOSES. AND MEDICATIONS AS THE TREATMENT IS REALLY THE GOLD STANDARD FOR OPIATE USE DISORDER AND AND SAVES LIVES. BUT BURDEN SOME PRIOR AUTHORIZATION HYPOTHESES AFFECT -- INSURANCE WHO ATTEMPT TO ACCESS MEDICATIONS SISTER TREATMENT AND THAT IS WHY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS ASSOCIATION RELEASED A COMPACT TO FIGHT AT ALL THE HOPE YO'RE CRISIS IN WHICH FORTY SIX GOVERNOR'S. CALLED FOR REDUCING -- PAYMENT AND MINISTRY BARRIERS TO MEDICATIONS TO TREATMENT. THE MEDIC THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IS ALSO CALLED FOR FOR HAVING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION TO STEP THERAPY MEDICATION SISTER TREATMENT DRUGS. AND AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE AMA BROKE JUSTICE JANUARY -- QUOTE THERE IS NO VALID REASON TO DELAY OR DENY MEDICALLY PROVEN CARE THAT CAN HELP IN THE NATION'S OPIOID EPIDEMIC AND IMPROVE PATIENTS' HEALTH AND LIVES. AND BECAUSE OF THIS IN RECOGNITION OF THIS A BOTH CIGNA AN ANTHEM HAVE AGREED TO END PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR MEDICATION SYSTEM TREATMENT NATIONWIDE. AFTER INVESTIGATIONS BY THE NEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL GENERAL'S OFFICE. I'M IN THE LIST OF STATES -- CONTINUES TO GROW THAT ARE PROHIBITED PRIOR AUTHORIZATION MEDICATIONS TO TREATMENT IN JUST THE PAST YEAR ILLINOIS MARYLAND ARIZONA -- THE PENNSYLVANIA ARKANSAS AND VIRGINIA HAVE ENACTED LEGISLATION TO PROHIBIT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS MEDICATION SISTER TREATMENT. TO HIGHLIGHTING THIS PROGRESS IN FEBRUARY -- CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL BECERRA HAS CALLED FOR ALL INSURERS IN CALIFORNIA TO REMOVE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL MEDICATIONS HAS TO TREATMENT. THEREFORE THE CALIFORNIA BELIEVES ASK YOU LIVE IN IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN ACCESS HE'S LIFESAVING TREATMENT -- IT LIFESAVING TREATMENTS AND URGED URGE YOUR SUPPORT. MY NAME IS RYAN HAMPTON I'M A PERSON RECOVERY FROM OPIATE ADDICTION THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TODAY I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY. IT IS BEEN A VERY LONG JOURNEY FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO FIND SUSTAINED. RECOVERY A LITTLE BIT OVER FOUR YEARS AGO -- I WAS ON THE STREETS OF SOUTH LOS ANGELES PAN HANDLING FOR CHANGE. I WAS TOO SICK TO FREE TO ASK FOR HELP -- I HEADED TENDED OVER A HALF DOZEN -- TREATMENT PROGRAMS IN THE YEARS LEADING UP TO THAT MOMENT IN MY LIFE EACH. ONE HAD BEEN KIND OF ITS OWN SPIN CYCLE OF SERVICES AND NONE OF THEM OFFERING. MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT WHICH WAS EVIDENCE BASED CARE WHICH EVENTUALLY -- WOULD SAVE MY LIFE. BUT I HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES -- IN LATE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN I WAS ABLE TO ACCESS THAT KERR WAS ABLE TO ACCESS MATT AND THAT ALLOWED ME TO BEGIN MY RECOVERY JOURNALING JOURNEY. I'M NOT ONLY A PERSON. WHO IS FOUND RECOVERY FROM OPIATE ADDICTION AND DEFIED? PRETTY MUCH ALL THE STATISTICS THAT SAY I SHOULD BE DEAD RIGHT NOW -- SINCE ENTERING RECOVERY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WRITE A BOOK I'VE STARTED A NON PROFIT IN MY COMMUNITY. I PAY MY TAXES SOME OF ODOR -- AND I'M PLANNING TO START A FAMILY WITH MY PARTNER -- VERY SOON. I AM HERE TODAY BECAUSE MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT ALSO KNOWN AS MATT. ALONG WITH THE CRITICAL SUPPORT SERVICES THAT MUST COME WITH IT. SHOULD NOT BE A MATTER OF LUCK HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LIKE IT WAS. IN MY CASE AT THE HEIGHT OF OUR NATION'S MOST PRESSING HEALTH CRISIS AND I BELIEVE OUR STATE'S MOST PRESSING HEALTH CRISIS THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASONABLE EXPLANATION TO THE EXISTING BARRIERS. FOR THESE LIFESAVING TREATMENTS THAT HAVE ALLOWED ME TO LIVE. I AM NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO BELIEVES THIS AND FEELS THIS WAY EVERY SINGLE FEDERAL AGENCY THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE OPIOID CRISIS. THE N. I. H. N. A. S. FTA HHS NIDUS ANSWER THERE ALL IN AGREEMENT ON THREE THREE KEY POINTS ALL THE FDA APPROVED MEDS -- MEDICATION ASSIST TREATMENTS ARE EFFECTIVE IN TREATING HOPE YOU'RE USED TO SORTER. ALL OF THE FDA APPROVED MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENTS ARE UNDER UTILIZED IN THE EXPANDED USE OF ALL OF THE FDA APPROVED MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENTS IS CRITICAL. TO ENDING THIS CRISIS. AS I SIT HERE I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S IN THE NEWS THAT WE KNOW THE DEATH TOLL CONTINUES TO GROW -- THIS IS A CRISIS I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS LEGISLATURE OUR LEGISLATURE HAS A MANDATE TO DO THEIR JOB AND PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE OF OUR STATE. NO MATTER WHAT THE COST MAY BE. SAVING LIVES HAS GOT TO BE PARAMOUNT. I URGE YOU AYE BAG -- THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO PLEASE PASS THIS BILL SB ELEVEN EVERY SINGLE CALIFORNIAN SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE A HEALTHY ANY PURPOSEFUL. LIFE AND I BELIEVE THIS LEGISLATION WILL HELP INSURE THAT'S NO MATTER AN INSTANCE OF LOCK RATHER AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO SEEKS IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIRTY FIFTY SECONDS.

AGAIN SIX MINUTES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS NICK LOUISE US ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. POSITION ON THE BILL -- WERE HAPPY TO SEE THAT AMENDMENTS ARE BEING TAKEN TO THE REPORTING PROVISION OF THE BILL -- WHICH WE FOUND TO BE DUPLICATIVE AND UNNECESSARY HOWEVER WE STILL HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE DRUG FORMULARY PORTION OF THE BILL WHICH WE BELIEVE. SETS A NUMBER OF BAD PRECEDENCE -- JUST TO BEGIN -- MISTER AND MEMBERS I'M SB ELEVEN IS -- IT ESTIMATED TO INCREASE PREMIUMS FOR EMPLOYERS AND INDIVIDUALS BY APPROXIMATELY THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS. AND INCREASES MEDI CAL EXPENDITURES BY OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN THAT'S ACCORDING TO THE INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS -- WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF BENEFIT MANDATES THIS YEAR WHICH AS A AS A AS AS A TOTAL -- PACKAGE OF ALL BILLS IF YOU ADDED THEM UP A REPRESENTS ABOUT NINE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AN INCREASE PREMIUMS ACROSS THE STATE -- YOU KNOW WHICH SOMETHING THAT WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT WITH RESPECT TO THE AFFORDABILITY OF HEALTH CARE. NOW ON TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL -- IN A WHILE HEALTH PLANS OBVIOUSLY SUPPORTING COVER PRESCRIPTION DRUGS RELATED TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE -- DISORDER I'M SB ELEVEN AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED SETS A NUMBER OF VERY TROUBLESOME PRECEDENCE. IT REQUIRES TO COVER THESE DRUGS IN A MANNER THAT HAMSTRINGS ARE MEMBERS ABILITY TO MAKE SOUND COVERAGE POLICIES AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE BEST CLINICAL EVIDENCE AND THE COST OF THE DRUGS. OUR OBJECTION TO THESE PROVISIONS IS NOT BASED ON THE INTENDED GOAL OF THE BILL RATHER WE OPPOSE THE BILL BECAUSE IT REQUIRES OR THIS PROVISION OF THE PILL. A BECAUSE IT REQUIRES PLANS TO COVER THESE DRUGS IN A MANNER THAT PREVENTS US FROM BASING COVERAGE POLICIES -- ON ON ON REASONABLE CONSIDERATIONS NOW JUST BY WAY OF A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF HOW REMOVING COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY REMOVING ANY. MEDICAL MANAGEMENT UTILIZATION MAN AND OF MANAGEMENT OF THESE DRUGS I'M COULD HAVE -- UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES -- ONE DRUG THAT IS USED -- FOR THE TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS BEEPING AFTER RAIN WHICH IS ALSO AN OPIOID. AND IS SUBJECT TO MISUSE -- IT IT ALSO COULD BE DEADLY FOR PATIENT IF IT IS MIXED WITH ANOTHER DRUG -- WHERE IT HAS A NEGATIVE INTERACTIONS SO YOU FOR EXAMPLE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT -- BEN'S WITH A DAY AS A TEEN IS IS A DRUG THAT -- IS COMMONLY USED FOR MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS AS WELL -- YOU KNOW AS SUCH AS SCHIZOPHRENIA IF THAT IS USED WOULD BE DOT BEEPING AFRICAINE THAT COULD BE A VERY VERY -- DISASTROUS SITUATION FOR THE PATIENT TAKING THAT THOSE TWO DRUGS IN COMBINATION THE HEALTH PLAN MIGHT BE THE ONLY ENTITY THAT HAS A LINE OF SIGHT ON TO ALL OF THE DRUGS. THAT A THAT A PERSON MIGHT BE TAKING PARTICULAR THAT PERSON'S GOING AT A NETWORK FOR TREATMENT -- ON THESE DRUGS WERE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS AND WE THINK WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN REASONABLE MEDICAL MANAGEMENT ON THESE DRUGS -- YOU KNOW IN SOME CASES YOU KNOW NOW TRICKS OWN COMMONLY KNOWN AS VIVID TRAWL HAS A LOW EFFECTIVENESS RATES -- HOWEVER ACCORDING TO THIS BILL WE WOULD HAVE TO COVER IT WITHOUT ANY PRIOR AUTHORIZATION DESPITE THE FACT THAT IN MANY CASES -- IT MIGHT NOT WORK FOR A PATIENT -- IT'S ALSO VERY EXPENSIVE WHICH GETS TO THE POINT OF THE PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT REQUIRES ALL SUBSTANCE ABUSE RELATED DRUGS TO BE COVERED ON THE LOWEST TIER. WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO COST ANY DRUG THAT WAS. APPROVED BY THE FDA HAS TO BE COVERED AT THE LOWEST HERE NO MATTER HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS NO MATTER WHAT IT WHETHER IT WORKS OR NOT SO MANY. THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF OF A NUMBER OF THE REALLY BAD PRECEDENT SET BY THIS BILL WE'RE WILLING TO WORK YOU KNOW WITH WITH THE AUTHOR -- IN THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL TRY WORKS ON THESE ISSUES OUT BUT TO COMPLETELY ERASE ANY MEDICAL MANAGEMENT F THESE DRUGS YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE -- IT PUTS THE PLANS IN A POSITION TO COVER BAD MEDICINE. AT THE WRONG TIME FOR THE WRONG PEOPLE POTENTIALLY AND SO-- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO MAINTAIN OUR OPPOSITION TO THAT PROVISION OF THE BILL THANK YOU. SEVENTY WALKING THE MAP OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WE TO WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL TODAY I WOULD ECHO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS WE WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT. ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL OUR SISTERS SO SHE XIN A HIP ALONG WITH THE AN AC ARE WORKING WITH HOSPITALS PROVIDER GROUPS TO COME UP WITH THE MORE STREAMLINED PROCESS FOR PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. AND BEST PRACTICES WE THINK THAT WOULD BE A BETTER OPTION FOR US TO LOOK AT ESPECIALLY FOR A LOOP LOOKING TO LIMIT ACCESS TO PRIOR AUTHORIZATION OR LIMIT OUR ABILITY FOR MEDICAL MANAGEMENT TOOLS WE CERTAINLY WANT PROVIDERS TO DO THEIR JOB WE WANT THEM TO PROVIDE THE BEST CARE. POSSIBLE TO THEIR PATIENTS BUT REMOVING COMPLETELY OUR ABILITY TO USE ANY MEDICAL MANAGEMENT TOOLS WE THINK IS A BIT SHORT SIGHTED IN THE LONG TERM OF MAKING SURE THAT. PATIENTS HAVE THE BEST CARE GIVEN THE FACT THAT OFTENTIMES PLANS ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE A FULL LINE OF SIGHT OF ALL THE MEDICATIONS THAT ARE PRESCRIBED AND THAT ARE BEING COVERED. WE CERTAINLY THINK WE PLAY A ROLE IN NOT AND FOR THAT REASON STAY WE'RE STILL OPPOSED TO THE BILL THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YEAH JOHN WINGER ON BEHALF AMERICA'S HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS EXACTLY POINTED OUT A HIP HAS BEEN ON THE FRONTLINE NTIONALLY WITH THE STOP INITIATIVE THE SAFE TRANSPARENT OPIOID PRESCRIBING INITIATIVE AND WE ARE LOOKING TO REMOVE BARRIERS ON PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. AND INCREASING MATT -- UTILIZATION BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL STILL THE GOES A LITTLE TOO FAR WE LOOK FOR TO HAVE AN FOR THE CONVERSATIONS ON IT PURPOSE. THANK YOU. KAREN CIRCUIT SCENE WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WERE OPPOSED DUE TO THE INCREASED HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS FOR EMPLOYER EMPLOYERS AND AN ORAL LEASE. THANK YOU. CASEY NO OTHER. WHAT IS THAT THE MICROPHONE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS CENTER STONE [inaudible] FIGURES CHAIR -- SO I GOT A FEW QUESTIONSFOR YOU NEXT -- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT SIGNIN ANTHEM GREETER MOVE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS FOR MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT IN RESPONSE TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN NEW YORK -- AND THEIR PARITY INVESTIGATIONS SO IF SICKENING ANTHEM CAN AGREE TO MOVE THESE BARRIERS WAY. TO OBJECT PROHIBITING AUTHORIZATIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL IS NOT LIMITED TO MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT THIS BILL -- INCLUDES ALL SUBSTANCE ABUSE RELATED DISORDER DRUGS. SO I MEAN I EN L. SO THAT'S THE FIRST I'VE HEARD OF THIS SO WE WILL LOOK INTO THAT BUT THIS BILL IS NOT LIMITED TO MATT OKAY -- IT EVEN SAYS ON THIS ON THE WEBSITE IF PROHIBITING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION HARMS PATIENT SAFETY WHITE IS. CIGNA TODD ON ITS WEB PAGE THAT TO SAVE LIVES AS A PART OF THE OPIOID CRISIS THAT REMOVES PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS SO -- YOU KNOW IT I THE PHARMACIST NOW FOR I HATE TO ADMIT IT -- THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY EIGHT YEARS. AN OLD TIME WENT. AND I'VE ALWAYS -- HAVE PROBLEMS WITH PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS IT KINDA DROVE ME FROM RETAIL PHARMACY TO GOING TO COMPOUNDING JUST DEAL WITH CASH CUSTOMERS INSTEAD OF INSURANCE CUSTOMERS PRESS SPENDING. 25% OF MY TIME. DEALING WITH A PHARMACY TECHNICIANS ARE PEOPLE THAT WERE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE DRUGS -- I HAD TO CALL ON BEHALF OF PHYSICIANS. IT OUT IN A LETTER THAT WE GOT FROM. THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA CBH THE EIGHT THEY CLAIM THAT ONE IN. TEN AMERICANS SEEKING A MEDICATION FOR ADDICTION TREATMENT ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT LARGELY -- DUE. TO UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT POLICIES THE POSE SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLES SO. WE HAVE AN OP A CRISIS. AND IT'S EXACERBATED BY HAVING OPIATES A CLAIM TO BE ONE OPIATE-THAT AREN'T THAT OLD YET THERE ACTUALLY ANOTHER OLD VIçT. NUMBER FOR INTO HEROIN VERSUS PH&lt;c.cyan&gt; N<u> WE HAVE A A LOT BUT</u>&lt;/c&gt; THEN AGAIN THIS COUNTRY AND I'VE HAD. TO FAMILY FRIENDS OF LOS THEIR CHILDREN [inaudible] TO OVERDOSES OF FENTANYL. THINKING THAT THEY ARE BEING TREATED WITH -- THEY WERE UTILIZING WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS HEROIN. ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN THROUGH A PROGRAM -- METHADONE. BUPRENORPHINE AND AND FAILED -- I'VE ALWAYS SEEN PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS AS A IS A WAY -- TO MORE THAN QUESTION THE EFFICACY OF A DOCTOR'S DESIRE TO USE A PARTICULAR DRUG. THE INSURANCE COMPANIES -- OBSESSION IF YOU WILL WITH SAVING MONEY. AND IT COMES DOWN TO THE QUESTION -- WHAT IS IT WHAT IS A LIFE WORTH? YOU KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT THE NOW TRACKS ON THEM IT'S FUNNY YOU MENTION OF TRACKS ON BECAUSE WHEN I WAS -- AN INTERNET -- USC SCHOOL OF PHARMACY WE HAD EXTERNSHIP PROGRAMS AND I WAS INTERNING AT RANCHO LOS AMIGOS HOSPITAL. AND THE HEAD OF THE TREATMENT CENTER THERE -- HE GAVE EVERY STUDENT CAME THROUGH A A DRUG THAT THEY HAD TO RESEARCH IT WAS AND PROGRESS OF BEING APPROVED. AND FUNNY WAS NOW TRUCKS ON THAT WAS MY DRUG SO I I BECAME INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH NICK NOW TRUCKS ON OVER THIRTY FIVE THIRTY SIX YEARS AGO. AND LEARN WHAT -- INCREDIBLE DRUG THAT THAT IS IS YOU KNOW IT'S RELATED TO NALOXONE OCCUPIES THE OPIATE RECEPTORS -- HAD. OUR FRIENDS OR FAMILY IF THEIR KIDS WERE ON NALTREXONE -- THEY WOULD PROBABLY STILL BE ALIVE TODAY. NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW. SUSTAINED RELEASE NALTREXONE IS NOT A CHEAP. INTRACTABLE YOU KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THIRTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH -- YOU KNOW I I GO BACK TO HEPATITIS C. -- YOU KNOW WE WE WE HAD A NEW DRUG THE CAME ON THE MARKET -- QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO CALLS OF ALL DAY RIGHT. IF IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN I THINK A NUMBER OF THE HEALTH PLANS REQUIRED ACROSS THE RESERVATION FIRST OF ALL DAY. WHY NOT BECAUSE IT WAS EFFICACIOUS IN CURING HEPATITIS C.? BUT BECAUSE WAS COSTING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FOR TREATMENT. SO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU COMPARE THE COST OF WELL IF WE PUT PEOPLE ON INTERFERE ON IN ANOTHER DRUG TO TREAT THEIR HABSI -- THEY'RE ULTIMATELY GOING TO HAVE TO HAVE A LIVER TRANSPLANT WHICH IS GOING TO BE HALF A MILLION DOLLARS AND UNDER GOING TO BE PROBABLY ON A MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF ANTI REJECTION DRUGS. AND SO -- I HAVE A CONCERN THAT. THE PATIENT'S BEST INTEREST. IS IS NOT ALWAYS FIRST AND FOREMOST WHEN IT COMES TO PICKING MEDICATIONS -- FOR THEIR TREATMENT AND I I I AND I REALLY GET UPSET BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE IN IN THE LAST -- ISSUE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF A DOCTOR PATIENT RELATIONSHIP. AND I DON'T THINK THAT A TECHNICIAN ON A TELEPHONE LINE WHEN I'M GOING TO CALL AND GET A DRUG WITH THIS DOCTOR CLAIMS IS UNIQUE AND IMPORTANT FOR THIS PERSON. SHOULD NOT BE GRANTED. TO BE USE WITHOUT GOING THROUGH MULTIPLE BARRIERS ARE BUREAUCRACY WITHIN A HEALTH PLAN TO SOMETIMES TAKE DAYS -- TO TO ACCOMPLISH NOW I CAN UNDERSTAND IF YOU HAVE A BRAND NAME AND GENERIC. I AM 1100% IN FAVOR OF GENERIC SUBSTITUTION WHEREVER POSSIBLE -- OR IF YOU HAVE MULTIPLE PHARMACOLOGICAL CLASSES OF DRUGS WE GOT SOME ALL DO YOU GOT A FEW OTHERS NOW. YOU CAN MAKE YOUR BEST DEAL WITH WHATEVER COMPANY AND GET YOUR REBATES AND LOWER YOUR COSTS FOR YOUR YOUR INCH IT YOUR INSURANCE COMPANIES BUT THE PATIENT IS GOING TO GET A STATE OF THE ART MEDICATION. I THINK WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS A WE WANT A STATE OF THE ART MEDICATION AND COMPLIANCE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO TREATMENT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE OPIATE. ISSUES AND A CAT HAVE DELAYS THE CAN HAVE BARRIERS AND YES YOU KNOW -- AS WE SEE NEW TREATMENTS COME ONLINE. PREMIUMS MAY GO UP YOU KNOW I'M SORRY THE PREMIUMS IN ABOUT THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT. IF IT'S MY SON OR MY DAUGHTER THIS GOT AN OPIATE ADDICTION AND THEIR DOCTOR FEELS AT THEIR MEDICATION SHOULD BE A COSTLY MEDICATION. THE COULD SAVE THEIR LIFE INSTEAD OF USING SOMETHING THAT -- THEY COULD POTENTIALLY FAIL WITH IN AS THE FILL WITHOUT THE THE TRAGIC SIDE EFFECT IS THEY COULD DIE [inaudible] SO -- WE WE NEED -- TO IT EMBRACE THE STATE OF THE ART THERAPY -- FOR THESE EMERGENCY SITUATIONS WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT COME TO US THAT WANT TO GET HELP. YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT'S A BIG STEP SIR YOU KNOW AND I AND I WANT TO APPLAUD YOU FOR FOR YOU FOR YOU. SEEKING HELP IN TURNING YOUR LIFE AROUND -- I DON'T KNOW IF YOU IF YOU WERE START STARTED OUT WITH STEP THERAPIES -- OR WERE YOU MERELY PUT ON YOU KNOW SOMETHING LIKE THAT THE TALL AND HOW DID YOU MANAGE YOUR SUCCESS SO I I ACTUALLY HAD TO FIGHT TO GET ON TO IT -- MEDICATIONS TO TO TREATMENT -- IT WAS VERY HARD FOR ME TO GET ON THIS LAST TIME AND I'M GRATEFUL THAT I WAS ABLE TO GET ON IT BECAUSE IT SAVED MY LIFE BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW I I I TRY TO KEEP MY EMOTIONS OUT OF THESE HEARINGS AND AND WHEN THIS COMES UP BUT I HAVE. PERSONALLY STOOD OVER THE GRADES OF TWENTY SIX OF MY FRIENDS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS WHO HAVE DIED FROM OVERDOSES. TO TWO YEARS MEDIAN AGE WE'RE PROBABLY TALKING TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD GOOD KIDS PEOPLE LIKE SONS DAUGHTERS EMPLOYEES -- THEY ALL WANT TO HELP A LOT OF THEM. WERE THE NUMBER ONE STORY COMING OUT WAS MY INSURANCE COMPANY MY KIDS INSURANCE COMPANY OR MY INSURANCE COMPANY WON'T PAY FOR TREATMENT. AND THEY CANNOT GET TREATMENT BECAUSE OF THE BARRIERS THAT STILL EXIST AND THAT IS WRONG AND AND I UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WE GET CAUGHT UP IN THE THEN THE COST. AND I HEAR FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT THAT THAT IT'S GOING TO BE THEN THEY'RE GONNA PUT THE COST ON TO CONSUMERS. YOU KNOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIRTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS -- THE THERE IS I I BELIEVE THERE IS NO COST THAT IS THAT. THAT MAKES A JUSTIFICATION FOR JUST THE PEOPLE THAT ARE BURIED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. IT IS WRONG AND AS A PERSON WHO'S WHO IS ON THE FRONT LINES WATCHING THIS I'M SO SICK AND TIRED OF HEARING THAT ARGUMENT. AS A JUSTIFICATION -- TO TO PUTTING UP BARRIERS TO TO TREATMENT LIKE THAT HAS GOT TO STOP BOB THANK YOU AND I PER PROCEDURE ANSWERED AND I'D LIKE TO RESPOND ALSO I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF RESPECT -- FOR THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND AND I UNDERSTAND SOME OF THESE BIG PLANS OR OR MEMBERS OF THE CHAMBER -- BUT I'M GONNA QUOTE FROM THE CHAMBERS LETTER THAT THE HIGHER PRICED DRUGS -- NOT PROVIDING BENEFITS COMMENSURATE WITH THE COSTS YOU KNOW -- SINCE WHEN DOES THE CHAMBER ANDERS UNDERSTAND -- PHARMACOLOGY MEDICAL BENEFITS BETTER THAN THE PHYSICIANS THAT ARE WRITING FOR THE PRESCRIPTIONS I MEAN I'M JUST. OUTRAGE THAT -- THEY COULD MAKE A COMMENT LIKE THAT THEY CAN THEY CAN POSE IT CERTAINLY CAN OPPOSE IT BUT DON'T DON'T QUESTION THE THE THE PROFESSIONALISM OF THE PHYSICIAN THAT'S DOING THE BEST THEY CAN TO PROVIDE THE THE BEST THERAPY. FOR FOR IT FOR THEIR FR THEIR PATIENTS -- IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THAT -- COSTS SEEMS. TO OVERRIDE -- CLINICAL EVIDENCE AFFECT EFFICACY WHEN THESE FORMULARIES ARE MADE AND I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND. THE BENEFITS OF TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY OF DOING THAT BUT IF WE HAVE A DRUG AND AND IF YOU AND PROBABLY WHEN YOU SEE THE HOW THE HIGHER TIER DRUGS. ON FORMULAR USE IN MOST CASES THEY WERE UNIQUE. THEY HAVE A VERY STE -- SPECIFIC PHARMACOLOGY NOT FOUND WITH ANY OTHER DRUGS THERE'S THERE'S GENERIC. SUBSTITUTE AND THEY PROVIDE USUALLY A A QUICKER HIGHER QUALITY OF LIFE FROM PROVIDE HEALING AND AND TREATMENT. AND UNFORTUNATELY THOSE OF THE DRUGS AND HAVE THE HIGHEST COPAYS ANOTHER ONCE THE HARD TO GET FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES BECAUSE OF THIS. BUREAUCRATIC MAZE OF GETTING PRIOR AUTHORIZATION AT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES TAKE NOT DAYS BUT SOMETIMES TAKE SIX WEEKS TO GET THEIR SENATOR I I HATE TO INTERRUPT BUT I JUST HAD SOME BELOW CONSCIOUS OF THE I'M ALMOST A TIME AND NICE REALIZE UPRIGHT LAST PERSON BRING IT UP WITH YOU. BUT YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT SO. YEAH IT IS GOING. I'M SURPRISED THEY KNOW ANYTHING OTHER THAN SAYING THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SO. SO I'LL JUST I'LL JUST CUT TO THE CHASE YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT WE REMOVE BARRIERS. AND OTHER INSURANCE COMPANY CIGNA MATH OF A RECOGNIZE THAT WITH THIS CLASSIFICATION OF MEDICATIONS FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE -- OPIATE OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS WE HAVE SOME GOOD MEDICATIONS OUT THERE YES THEY ARE EXPENSIVE I UNDERSTAND THAT -- BUT WE HAVE A GROWING EPIDEMIC AND MY LITERATURE SHOWS THAT ONE OUT OF TEN ARE SUCCESSFULLY -- GETTING OF THE MEDICATIONS THAT THEY NEED AND EVEN PHYSICIANS OR OR REPORTING -- DIFFICULTY LIKE GETTING TH THEIR PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS. THROUGH AND GETTING THEM APPROVED IN SOME CASES THE PATIENTS JUST COMPLETELY -- ABANDON THE EFFORT OF TRYING TO GET THE DRUG BECAUSE OF SUCH A PROBLEM TO ANYWAY NECK I I KNOW I THROUGH A WHOLE LOT OF JUDAH I KNOW YOU HEARD REPRESENT YOUR CLIENT -- BUT WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO. TO THE ENSURE THAT WHEN SOMEBODY AS HAS AN OPIATE PROBLEM WHEN YOU GOT A CURRENT IT'S GOT A A CHILD IN IT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. AND WE'VE GOT THESE GREAT DRUGS ON THE MARKET BUT WE WE WE WE GOT A BREAK THIS BUREAUCRATIC MORASS STUDY TO GET THEM THAT THE DRUGS THAT THEY DESPERATELY NEED AND DESERVE. ONE WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL. AND SO I THINK IF WE ARE ABLE TO RETAIN. THE ABILITY TO USE A GENERIC INSTEAD OF A BRAND WHICH THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM DOES NOT ALLOW. THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY IN IN THE VERY LIMITED CASES WHERE THERE IS AN IMPORTANT CLINICAL REASON. FOR US TO REVIEW THE APPROVAL OF THE MEDICATION AND FOR INSTANCE THE DRUG INTERACTION WHICH CAN KILL THE PATIENT THINGS LIKE THAT THEN I THINK THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY IN ADDRESSING OUR CONCERNS. SO -- YOU KNOW OUR OUR POSITIONS NOT JUST COST BASED. UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT AND I'VE KNOWN YOU TO BE A PROFESSIONAL LOBBYISTS HERE IN SACRAMENTO THE SHORT TIME THAT I'VE BEEN HERE AND I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO WORK WITH IT WITH THE AUTHOR. ESPECIALLY WITH THE GENERIC SUBSTITUTION SEN -- YOU KNOW THIS WHY WE WE URGE -- SINCE TWO DOT ONLY USE THEIR DOCTOR BUT ALSO CHOOSE ONE PHARMACY WHETHER IT'S AN INDEPENDENT PHARMACY IS CVS. FOR A WALGREENS SO WE CAN MONITOR THOSE THOSE DRUG INTERACTIONS TO MAKE SURE. THAT -- WE'RE WE'RE PROTECTING THE PATIENT GIVEN THE THE MOST HOLISTIC CARE THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN THANK YOU MISTER. OKAY THANK YOU OF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY AND FORTUNATELY I DO HAVE. WHICH I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS -- MYSELF -- AND I AT FIRST WILL CENTER BY APPRECIATE -- OUR DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS BILL -- I APPRECIATE YOU TOOK THE AMENDMENTS REGARDING THE REPORTING FROM A PARITY -- I AND I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP AS A CHAMPION FOR MENTAL HEALTH PARITY AND ALSO -- SUBSTANCE USE -- TREATMENT IN FACT -- YOU KNOW THIS COMMITTEE DISAPPEAR PRIORITY HEALTH INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON THIS VERY TOPIC. I AM. CHALLENGED ABOUT THE TOTAL LACK OF ANY FORM OF REVIEW ROUND THE MEDICATION SO I'LL I SHARE YOUR GOAL I MEAN I MEAN WE ABOUT TRYING TO BE SURE WE HAVE A SET OF MEDICATIONS. WHERE THERE WERE THERE ISN'T FOR IT IN DIFFERENT CLASSES SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET ACCESS WE DON'T WANT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE CAN GET ACCESS? TO MEDICATION BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT IF WE'D COMPLETELY SAY WELL BY LAW WE'RE GONNA REQUIRE YOU COVER EVERYTHING NO MATTER WHAT. A AND I'M A PHYSICIAN SO I I I GET AND I I THINK THAT SOUNDS GREAT. UNTIL THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT YOU KNOW I HAVE A BILL TO MANDATE HEALTH COVERAGE WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO FUND SUBSIDIES FOR HEALTH INSURANCE -- AND SO WE WANT TO BE SURE PEOPLE GET ACCESS TREATMENT WHY OF COVERAGE YOU CAN GET ACCESS TREATMENT BUT YOU ALSO WANT TO BE A HAVE SOME MECHANISMS TO TO TO TO TO HELP MODERATE. TO AN UPWARD PUSH ON PRICES OF JUST FOR EXAMPLE -- YOU KNOW THE LOCKS ON WHICH COSTS A DOLLAR A DECADE AGO IS NOW A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS AND THEN NOT INJECTORS FORD FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NOT WE CAN GO AND DEVELOP THE PHARMACY. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT WE DON'T GIVE ANY MECHANISM. TO TO TO PURCHASE OF FOR EXAMPLE I CAN SEE THE THE HEALTH PLANS REPOSE IF THERE'S A GENERIC AVAILABLE. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'D BE OPEN TO OR IS IT ACTUALLY HAS TO BE WHATEVER THE DOCTOR PRESCRIBES I MEAN I IN SOME WAYS I KIND OF LEAN TOWARD THAT BUT I HAVE TO SAY AS A POLICY MAKER I'M NOT SURE I CAN GO THAT FAR -- WHEN I GOT THE -- COMMITTEE MEMBER AND SO ON MONDAY DURING THE SESSION. AND I HAD A COUPLE DAYS TO REVIEW THEM -- AND I SAW THAT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS PRETTY MUCH GOT IT THE BILL -- I DECIDED I WOULD ACCEPT. PART OF THE AMENDMENTS AND NOT ACCEPT THE PART OTHER PART OKAY SO MY MY PURPOSE TODAY IS TO GET THE COMMITTEE TO APPROVE. THE BILL. AS I'M SUGGESTING HOPEFULLY. AND IF YOU HAVE SOME FURTHER REFINEMENTS I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK TO PEOPLE I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE OTHER AND NEVER HAVE. BUT QUITE FRANKLY -- WHEN I SAW THE COMMUNITY AMENDMENTS IT ACTUALLY MAKES IT WORSE THAN THE CURRENT SITUATION? THEN -- WE HAVE NOW IT ACTUALLY GOES BACKWARDS. IN CALIFORNIA GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU ATTORNEY GENERAL'S HAVE GOTTEN CIGNA AND THE OTHER -- AT THE OTHER HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS BY A LAWSUIT. TO AGREE -- TO FULL OF MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT SO SO FOR ME -- YEAH I I'LL TALK YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TALK TO THESE GUYS -- FOR TWELVE YEARS THEY NEVER SUPPORT ANY OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH BILLS HOWEVER. WE CAN STILL TALK TO ON FOOD BUT AND AND I'M SURE THE OTHER PEOPLE WILL TOO BUT THE PRINCIPLE THAT I WANT TO I WANT TO GET YOU TO VOTE FOR TODAY THIS IS THE PRINCIPLE. THAT YOU SHOULD NOT IMPEDE. MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO HAVE THAT AS THE THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION -- IF YOU HAVE SOME REFINEMENTS ON ON GENERICS ARE ALL THAT I'D BE WILLING TO TALK TO THIS THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD THAT THA'S AN IDEA LET'S TALK ABOUT IT -- THOSE ARE THINGS I CAN TALK ABOUT I'VE ALWAYS BEEN ABLE. TO WORK OUT TO THE ISSUES WITH. MY COLLABORATION WITH EVERYBODY IS CONCERNED ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. I THINK WE MADE SIGNIFICANT -- CONCESSIONS. TO BE HONEST ABOUT IT I THINK THAT -- THE REPORTING. IS INADEQUATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE GOT AN ELF. IN TERMS OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. SO WE'RE NOT REPORTING. AND WE'RE NOT ENFORCING MENTAL HEALTH PARITY. IT'S NOT HAPPENING. BUT WHAT I'D LIKE TO GET THE COMMITTED DATE IS SUPPORT. MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT WITHOUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER STATES ARE DOING. JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER STATES ARE DOING THEY'RE ALL DOING IT. AND THEY'RE ALL DOING IT BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE NATIONAL ORGANISATION. CALLING THE MEDICAL ORGANIZATION. AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IS RECOMMENDING THAT. SO. THAT'S THAT'S MY RESPONSE I MEAN A I IF I FAIL TO GET SUPPORT FOR THAT -- JUST BE BACK NEXT YEAR. THANK YOU WELL -- OKAY SO I I FIRST OF ALL I WANNA MAKE NOTE THAT -- I THINK THERE ARE. ONLY TWO STATES TO HAVE LIMóN AND SUCH ABOUT PRIOR OFF BUT NAY JUST PUT IT THIS WAY -- CENTER ABOUT FIRST OF ALL I I I DO SHARE YOUR GOALS -- I I I I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF ANY. EFFORT TO TRY -- TO YES TRUTHS THE MECHANISMS TO TRY TO AT LEAST TO BE SURE THAT WE PRIORITIZE THE YOUNG WE WANT WANTS THAT WORK I MEAN MANY OF THEM WORK. WE WANT TO BE SURE OF YOUR PEOPLE OF ACCESS TO NEARLY I DON'T WANT TO MEDICAID YELTSIN FEATURES AT LEAST ONE IN EVERY CLASS OF NOT MORE THAT PEOPLE CAN ACCESS IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH ANY BARRIERS. I'M GOOD WITH THAT -- I THINK THE ISSUE IS IT'S A SAY THAT ANY SPLIT ANY POSSIBLE TREATMENT. IS IS SO LET'S JUST PUT IT THIS WAY I I APPRECIATE YOUR DESIRE YOU EXPRESSED DESIRE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS. UNFORTUNATE I PERSONALLY AM NOT UNTIL WE CAN FIGURE OUT SOME KIND OF MECHANISM -- THEY CANNOT DEAL NOT DENNIS ALTHOUGH IT WAS WAS I I WANT THE BILL TO MOVE OUT I'LL GIVE YOU IF IT TURNS OUT YOU NEED COURTESY PHOTO DO THAT -- BUT I ALSO BECAUSE YOUR COMMITMENT TO CAN YOU TO WORK ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WE CAN PUT IN SOME REASONABLE. MECHANISMS THAT STILL ALLOW BECAUSE I DON'T WANT ANY I WANT PEOPLE NOT TO HAVE SEEN EVEN BARRIERS TO GETTING TREATMENT SO I I I I I CHAIR YET GOAL. AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN STRIKE A BETTER MIDDLE GROUND FOR WE STILL BE SURE PEOPLE ACCESS REMOVAL WOULD JUST DON'T LEAVE IT SO OPEN ENDED. THAT OF WHATEVER DATA WE HAVE NO OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO EXERT SOME EFFORT -- TO TO BE SURE PEOPLE BOTH GET QUALITY TREATMENT AND ALSO SOME COST EFFECTIVENESS AS WELL -- THEN AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE DOLLARS SO I SAW CENTER MITCHELL'S HANDLES A IS A RITUAL. A YES OKAY. YES. A DIFFICULT QUESTION I CLARIFICATION THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE COMMITTEE DISTRIBUTED. ARE THEY THE COMMITTEES RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS OR ARE% THEY THE AMENDMENTS THAT -- SENATOR BILL HAS AGREED TO ACCEPT. OF THOSE AMENDMENTS FOR A I THINK WHAT THE SERGEANTS AND DISTRIBUTED ARE SENATOR BELLS AMENDMENTS. THAT M. HE SAID THAT'S PARTIALLY WHAT THE COMMITTEES SUGGEST THIS IS WHAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARSENAL OF THE DEMAND SO YOU'RE THE DIMENSIONS THAT YOU ARE ACTUALLY ACCEPTING OUR DAUGHTER. ACCORDING -- REDUCE AGO TALKING ABOUT THE REPORTING ISSUE. IN THE FUTURE OF THAT'S KIND OF WHERE I'M COMING -- STILL PROBLEM -- BUT THE MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT -- WE WOULD LIKE. TO HAVE YOU ADOPT ARE REQUESTED AMENDMENTS OKAY THANK YOU ARE CENTER STONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AYE AYE. THE SENATE BILL -- I I AGREE WITH. A LOT OF WHAT THE BILL IS DOING ESPECIALLY WITH PARITY IN. NINETEEN YOU WERE WORKING ON THIS LONG BEFORE I CAME TO THIS INSTITUTION [inaudible] SO. I THINK THE MAYBE YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER -- AN AMENDMENT. TO WORK WITH THE STAFF THAT SAYS THAT. NUMBER. ONE IF THERE'S A GENERIC AVAILABLE FOR ANY DRUG. UNLESS THE DOCTOR RISE DO NOT SUBSTITUTE ON THAT PRESCRIPTION. THAT PATIENT GETS THE GENERIC DRUG UNLESS THEY OBJECT TO WANT TO PAY FOR THE BRAND IN THEMSELVES [inaudible] SO -- I WON IT AND IT IS A PART OF A POTENTIAL AMENDMENT. I THINK THE AMENDMENT SHOULD READ THAT -- THE THE COST. FOR A UNIQUE DRUG. FOR WHICH THERE IS NO GENERIC EQUIVALENT. SHALL NOT REQUIRE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'M KIND OF LOOKING FOR AND IF IF A DRUG DOES REQUIRE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION BECAUSE MAYBE FIND A DRUG INTERACTION. THAT WE IT IS INCUMBENT UPON. THE PLANNED TO RESPOND BACK. WITH AN APPROVAL OR DENIAL WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS BECAUSE IT'S THESE DELAYS THAT GET IN THE WAY OF PEOPLE GETTING THE TIMELY TREATMENTS THEY NEED I THROW THIS OUT THERE IS A SUGGESTION SO MAYBE YOU WANT TO CONSIDER. BECAUSE I'D LOOK TRYING TO BRIDGE THE GAP MINE BUT I I OF OF I DON'T KNOW HOW TO REACT TO THAT TODAY. I'M SORRY AWESOME SUGGESTIONS I'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU AND PLANS ON THAT BUT I THINK IT I THINK IT ACCOMPLISHES SIR WHAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU GET ACCOMPLISHED HERE. WITH THAT. SO OKAY. OKAY [inaudible] OKAY. AT GROWTH. OKAY THERE'S A MOTION FROM CENTER MONEY AS OUR GROWTH THANK YOU. AND I WASN'T GONNA ASK A QUESTION ON THIS BILL BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN HERE LATE IN THIS AND THAT CHAIR HAD ALREADY SPOKEN BUT I WHEN YOU WERE TALKING AND ANSWERING A RESPONSE AND ANOTHER QUESTION YOU SAID THAT. THIS BILL THAT YOUR BILL FOCUSES ON THE IN MAY TEACH JUST THE DRUG ITSELF -- TO GIVE SOMEBODY AN OPTION -- LIKE THIS GENTLEMAN RIGHT HERE BUT IN THE LANGUAGES SAYS ALL. ALL PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS.

PARADISE ANOTHER SMALL COMMUNITIES IN BUTTE COUNTY. THAT WAS CATASTROPHIC AND IT DID NOT JUST AFFECT [inaudible] THE RAGE [inaudible] AND PARADISE. IT REFLECT THE AFFECTED A BROADER AREA. THE ONE HUNDRED BED FACILITY THERE IN PARADISE. WAS ONE OF THE FEW ACUTE CARE RESOURCES. IN THE WHOLE COUNTY. IT WAS INTEGRAL. TO THE PEOPLE. THEIR PEACE OF MIND TO KNOW ON OF THEIR ACCESS. CLOSER. TO THEIR HOMES ARE COMMUNITIES. AND IT IS FAIRLY ISOLATED AREA THE ADVENTISTS WHICH RUNS THIS FACILITY. THEY HAVE A CONFIRMED THAT THEY COULD GET THIS FACILITY UP AND OPERATING WITHIN JUST A FEW MONTHS. THE WAS DEVASTATED AT IS BIN. WE'VE WORKED WITH THE SPOT SHERMAN. YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF. AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. TO ENSURE THE VERY LIMITED SCOPE. OF THIS BILL. TO PROVIDE THE END. FOR THE FEATHER RIVER HOSPITAL PROVIDE EMERGENCY ROOM SERVICES. NAY. BY FOUR BY THIS BURKE VIRTUE OF THIS THEY WOULD COMPLY WITH THE NURSE PATIENT RATIOS AND STAFFING. HAVE A PHYSICIAN CERTIFIED EMERGENCY CARE. ON SITE AT ALL TIMES. AND AT HERE TO ALL EMERGENCY ROOM REGULATIONS. CURRENTLY WITHIN THE STATE. AS A PATIENTS SEEN AT THE FEATHER RIVER HOSPITAL. WOULD BE SERVICED ANOTHER ADVENTIST HOSPITAL. REASONABLY NEARBY RIGHT OUT. IN MARYSVILLE. BY THIS THE HOSPITAL COULD APPLY FOR TWO YEARS SPECIAL PERMIT TO OPERATE AT SEA ARE SERVICES. AND ALSO RE APPLY TWICE FOR PERMITS FOR UP TO A MAXIMUM OF SIX YEARS. IT'S BEEN THE POLICY IN THIS STATE TO NOT ALLOW STAND ALONE EMERGENCY CARE DEPARTMENTS OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL CONTINUUM OF CARE. BUT I BELIEVE THE NEWS OF THE COMMUNITY. THAT THIS MOMENT. AT SUCH CHALLENGING CIRCUMSTANCES AND IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES AS WOULD BE IMPOSED BY THIS BILL ARE WARRANTED. IT THE PURPOSE IS SIMPLY TO ALLOW. COMMUNITIES HOSPITALS SERVING AREAS. TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND. TO THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. IN A SAFE SETTING. AND THEN. IN THIS THIS PARTICULAR COMMUNITY A GOOD WORKING TOWARDS A MORE PERMANENT FACILITY. WITH ME TODAY THAT THE KEPT SHORT REPRESENTING ADVENTIST HOSPITALS FOR HER TESTIMONY OKAY THANK YOU -- I WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT -- THEIR SUPPORT ON BOTH SIDES IT IS EIGHT OH SEVEN PM SO -- YOU'LL HAVE SIX MINUTES TOTAL BUT IF YOU WISH TO USE LESS IT WOULD BE APPRECIATED. HI THIS SAID SHORT MOVED PRESENTING ADVENTIST HEALTH I'M GOING TO DEFER MY TESTIMONY EXCEPT TO SAY THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE CHAIR AND HIS STAFF -- IN WITH THE REST OF THE STAKEHOLDERS ON THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE ARE HAPPY TO TAKE TONIGHT. THANK YOU SENATOR NIELSEN FOR YOUR SUPPORT. I'M RICK ROSS IN THE PRESIDENT OF EVAN THIS HEALTH AND RIGHT OUT WHICH INCLUDES HAVE BEEN ASSAULTS OPERATIONS IN BUTTE COUNTY. PARTICULARLY FOR THE RIVER HOSPITAL IN PARADISE. HAVE BEEN A SELF INCLUDES SEVENTEEN HOSPITALS IN CALIFORNIA MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOSPITAL BASED RURAL HEALTH CLINICS. WE HAVE A DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT TO RURAL HEALTH CARE ANSWERED SOME OF OUR STATES MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. FOR THE RIVER HOSPITAL IN PARADISE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT COMMITMENT. BEFORE LAST FALL'S CAMPFIRE IT WAS A ONE HUNDRED BED THRIVING ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL THAT HAVE BEEN AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY FOR NEARLY SEVENTY YEARS. THE HOSPITAL SERVED A RURAL COMMUNITY WITH MORE THAN 80% OF OUR PATIENTS COVERED BY MEDICARE AL OR MEDICARE. MANY WITH SUBSTANTIAL CHALLENGES AND TRAVELING DISTANCES FOR THE CARE THAT THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES NEED. WE EMPLOYED MORE THAN THIRTEEN HUNDRED MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. LIKE MOST OF THE COMMUNITY OF PARADISE OUR HOSPITAL -- SUSTAIN SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DURING THE CAMPFIRE. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF THE QUEUE CARE FACILITY RECEIVE SUCH DAMAGES TO BE CURRENTLY INOPERABLE ARMOR AGENCY DEPARTMENT WAS A NEWER CONSTRUCTION AND SUSTAIN MORE LIMITED DAMAGE. OUR COMMUNITY WHILE DEVASTATED AND CONTINUES TO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS. PRIOR TO THE FIRE THE FEATHER RIVER EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SAW APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY PATIENTS PER DAY. MANY OF THE AREA HOSPITALS HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THEIR EMERGENCY VISITS SINCE THE CAMP FIRE. WHICH HAS IMPACTED ACCESS TO CARE ACROSS THE REGION. PEOPLE FROM NEARBY TOWNS ARE NOW TRAVELING AS LONG AS AN HOUR TO REACH AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. IN ADDITION LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE ESTIMATING THE APPROXIMATELY TWO THOUSAND UTILITY AND CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ARE COMING TO WORK IN PARADISE EACH DAY AND HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THEIR DIFFICULT WORK THESE WORKERS ARE MORE AT RISK FOR TRAUMATIC INJURY REQUIRING EMERGENCY CARE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE OF PARADISE OTHER NEARBY COMMUNITIES WOULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES IN PARADISE. WE APPRECIATE THE UNIQUENESS OF OUR REQUEST BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE IN OUR COMMUNITY OR IN AN EXCEPTIONALLY UNIQUE SITUATION. WE DO NOT YET KNOW WHICH OF OUR NEIGHBORS WILL BE COMING BACK. WE DON'T KNOW WHEN AND WHERE THE REBUILDING WILL OCCUR. AND WE WON'T FOR AWHILE HOWEVER WE DO KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW. OUR COMMUNITY IS IN DESPERATE NEED FOR CARE THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. ARMOR AGENCY DEPARTMENT WILL PROVIDE NEEDED CARE THAN OTHER TYPES OF CLINIC FACILITIES CANNOT. INCLUDING TWENTY FOUR SEVEN EMERGENCY CARE AND DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES. PROVIDED BY HIGHLY SKILLED AND VALUED EMERGENCY SERVICES PROFESSIONAL STAFF. WHEN OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PATIENTS NEED A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE WHAT STABILIZE WE ARE EQUIPPED WITH THE HELIPAD THAT CAN HANDLE ALL EMERGENT TRANSPORTS? HELICOPTER SERVICE CAN GET A PATIENT TO NUMBER HOSPITALS INCLUDING RIGHT OUT. HOSPITAL WHICH IS PART OF OUR SYSTEM IN TWENTY MINUTES IN THE END LOW MEDICAL CENTER IN LESS THAN. TEN DURING THAT TRANSPORT PATIENTS TO BE UNDER THE CONSTANT CARE OF TRAINED MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. SENATE BILL ONE FIFTY SIX WILL ALLOW HAVE BEEN A CELL. TO RESTORE ROLE EMERGENCY SERVICES TO OUR COMMUNITY WHILE CONTINUING TO ASSESS WHAT THE COMMUNITIES MEDICAL NEEDS. ARE AS ARE KIND COUNTY REBUILDS. WE REMAIN AS COMMITTED AS EVER TO PARADISE AND TO BI&lt;c.cyan&gt; COUNTY.&lt;/c&gt; AS WE ASSESS WHO COMES BACK AND WHAT KIND OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THEY NEED. AS WE HAVE FOR MANY YEARS WE WILL CONTINUE TO RESPOND AND TO SERVE. IN THE SHORT TERM HOWEVER EVIDENCE HEALTH IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT SENATE BILL. ONE FIFTY SIX WHICH IS AIMED AT BRINGING NEEDED EMERGENCY SERVICES BACK TO THE DEVASTATED COMMUNITY PARADISE. AND WE ARE JURAI VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AGAIN WE HAVE SUPPORT ON BOTH SIDES. TRIMMERS ALEX SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO PLEASE COME UP. TO MAKE ROOM FOR THEM PLEASE. AND YOU CAN JUST MOVE OVER A LITTLE. AREA OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER TURN MEMBERS BRIEFLY I JUST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF THE CHAIR AND THE AUTHOR FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS LEGISLATION -- WE WERE STRONGLY OPPOSED AND WITH THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY -- THE NURSES ARE HAPPY TO MOVE TO AN OR NEUTRAL POSITION. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MARK WINDOWS A WITH US HERE YOU CALIFORNIA -- AS A NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS WE WERE -- AT THAT POINT AT AN OPPOSE IN THIS AMENDED POSITION -- THE CURRENT PROPOSED LANGUAGE I THINK WE'LL BE IN A MUCH BETTER SPACE AFTER LOCALS BELIEVE AT THE LANGUAGE. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS I THINK THERE'S A MOTION FROM CENTER STONE -- SEND YOU SOMETHING SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS AND WORKING WITH -- THE HEALTH COMMITTEE SAFF ON THE SO WHICH IS LIKE THE CLOTHES. URGENT NOT AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR NIELSEN MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. CAN HI CAN I STONE STONE I DORADO. GROWTH GROUP I HER TADO. LEYVA MITCHELL MONNING. MONNING I RUBIO. RUBIO I FIND THAT TO HAS FIVE VOTES IT'S ENOUGH TO GET IT OUT BUT WILL HOLD ON ROLE FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS. OKAY SO YOU ALSO HAVE A SECOND BILL WHICH I UNDERSTAND ALSO HAS -- SUPPORT ON BOTH SIDES IT'S ITEM NUMBER FIVE SB. THREE EIGHTY TWO AND MISTER CHAIRMAN THIS AS THE FORMER BILL COULD BE MODELS FOR FUTURE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SUCH EMERGENCY. AND TRAGEDIES. IN TERMS OF SERVING. THE PATIENTS. MOST HEALTH PLANS OF THE SYSTEM THE HOSPITAL'S DIRECTING PATIENTS TO LOWER LEVELS OF CARE. WHEN THAT CARE? BUT THE HIGHER LEVEL IS NO LONGER NEEDED. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME INSTANCES WHERE LITTLE POLLS HAVE BEEN USED TO AVOID KAREN. FOR THOSE PATIENTS. AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THEN. IS CLARIFY EXISTING REQUIREMENTS FOR HEALTH PLANS TO ASSIST THE HOSPITAL IN IDENTIFYING AND TRANSFERRING PATIENTS TO THE LOWER LEVELS OF CARE. SUCH AS SKILLED NURSING. IF THERE'S NO AVAILABILITY THE LOWER LEVELS OF CARE THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE HEALTH PLANS TO REIMBURSE HOSPITAL AT EXTREMELY LOW. AND MODEST AMOUNTS. ALLOWING THAT CARE [inaudible] TO CONTINUE. IN THAT MORE MODEST. OR LIMITED. FOR IT IS NOT TO BE LOOKED AT AS A MANDATE. BUT A TRANSITION TRANSITION AND INSURANCE. ASSURANCE NOT INSURANCE WITH AN ASSURANCE TO THE PATIENTS. ALL RIGHT HERE TO TESTIFY IS MISTER ALEX HAWTHORN CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL [inaudible] ASSOCIATION. RESEARCHER MEMBERS ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HOSTILE SITUATION PROUD SPONSOR THIS BILL LIKE TO THINK THE SENATOR FOR BRING IT FORWARD AND THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR HARD WORK -- IN MAKING IT STRONGER WITH THE AMENDMENTS TWO THINGS VERY BRIEFLY THIS IS A NEW MANDATE ON HEALTH PLANS THIS IS A NEW REQUIREMENT. THIS CLARIFIES EXISTING RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER VERY EXTREME SITUATIONS. THE THING I POINT OUT IS THAT THE REIMBURSEMENT OR ASKING FOR IS IT CREDIBLY LOW IT'S THE MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT RATE -- MORE HOSPITALS DO NOT RECOVER THEIR COSTS WITH MEDI CAL AND WE'RE NOT INTENDING THIS TO PUNISH HEALTH PLANS. MOST OF THE HOSPITALS ARE FACTORED IN RURAL AREAS -- IT'S DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO STAY IN THESE SITUATIONS THE BILL'S VERY MODEST TO WE WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU I HEARD THERE'S A MOTION FROM SERRA GROVE -- WHAT OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT? FUNNY DELGADO ON BEHALF THE DISTRICT HOSPITAL LEADERSHIP FORM IN SUPPORT.

AND AND COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL THAT. TRIED TO CRAFT THE BILL IN A WAY THAT WAS MEANINGFUL AND IMPACTFUL TO THE PLANS I THINK THE ONE ISSUE THAT WE STILL REMAIN AND WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IF THE BILL DOES MOVE FORWARD IS A SHARED RESPONSIBILITY. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLAN IS A WHERE WHEN SOMEONE IS NOT MOVING OUT SO THAT WE CAN UNDER BETTER UNDERSTAND PLACEMENT -- BUT WITH THAT BEING SAID I THINK WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM AS THE SETTLEMENTS FOR AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE DURING THE STATE OF EMERGENCIES. TO ASSIST OUR ENROLLEES IN INSURANCE TO FIND APPROPRIATE CARE AND THE FASTEST WAY POSSIBLE THANK YOU.

SO -- WITH THAT THE MOTION IS TO PASS IS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS AS SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL CAN I CAN I STONE. STONE I'D DORADO. DRUGS -- I GROW. GROW BY HER TATO LEYVA LEYVA AYE MITCHELL. MORNING MORNING I RUBIO RUBIO AYE. HI. SIX SEVEN THE BILL HAS SEVEN VOTES -- WILL HOLD IT ON ON THE ROLE FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANKS VERY MUCH OKAY CENTER WIENER. I NUMBER FOUR SB ONE FIFTY NINE WELCOME PLEASE PLEASE BEGIN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MISTER CHAIRMAN -- THANK YOU DEAR COMMITTEE STAFFER. ARE WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL TO INCREASE. ACCESS TO PRODUCT UNTAPPED WHICH IS A CRUCIAL HIV PREVENTIVE THIS BILL IS AN LGBT CAUCUS. THE BILL -- I WANT TO START BY A% ON THERE ARE A FEW AMENDMENTS SO WE'VE AGREED ON WITH THE COMMITTEE AND I GOT I DO WANT TO THANK. ME SEVERAL WORKING WITH US ON A NOW I'M WITH THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE. THE FIRST -- IS -- AN AMENDMENT -- PROVIDING THAT HEALTH CARE. PLANS -- SHALL NOT PROHIBIT -- OR PERMIT A DELEGATED -- PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER TO PROHIBIT PHARMACISTS FROM FURNISHING PROPER POPPED -- THE SECOND AMENDMENT -- IS THAT ARE THE BILL WILL NOT REQUIRE -- HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLANS AND HEALTH INSURERS TO COVER PROPER PAP FURNISHED BY A PHARMACIST AND OUT OF NETWORK PHARMACY UNLESS THE HEALTH CARE PLAN. HAS AN OUT OF NETWORK PHARMACY BENEFIT. AND THE THIRD -- IS -- IS STATED AND I COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ON AN AMENDMENT TO PROHIBIT -- HEALTH CARE PLANS -- OR PM'S FROM REQUIRING A MAIL ORDER -- ACCESS TO A PROP OR ABOUT US IT WAS A THREE SADDAM WE WORK THROUGH WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THAT -- WERE -- ACCEPTING. MY COLLEAGUES -- SP ONE FIFTY NINE FOR EXPAND ACCESS -- TO PREP WHICH IS PRE EXPOSURE A FIX SOCIAL PROPHYLAXIS AND PAP WHICH IS A POST EXPOSURE. PROPHYLAXIS BY ALLOWING PHARMACISTS TO FURNISH -- THESE PROVIDED AS WELL WITHOUT OF HIS POSITIONS PRESCRIPTION. SB ONE FIFTY NINE ALSO PROHIBITS INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM SUBJECTING CRAP AND PAP TO PRIOR PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS OR STEP THERAPY. WE WORK THROUGH THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE ISSUES IN THE BILL AND THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS -- COMMITTEE -- AND SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED THE BILL IN BMP -- TO SETTLE -- SCOPE OF PRACTICE ISSUES -- SO THOSE SCOPE OF PRACTICE ISSUES ARE NOT BEFORE THE COMMITTEE ON THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION IS WOULD TRIGGER THE REFERRAL. AT THE HEALTH COMMITTEE -- BUT I WILL BRIEFLY GO THROUGH THEM -- JUST AS A MATTER OF CONTEXT. OUR PREP IS A ONCE A DAY A DAY PILL FOR HIV NEGATIVE PEOPLE OF AN ALMOST ENTIRELY ELIMINATES THE RISK OF HIV. INFECTION. IS A ONE TIME TWENTY EIGHT DAY COURSE FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED. TO HIV YOU TAKE A FOR TWENTY EIGHT DAYS AND THEN YOU'RE DONE AND IT REDUCES THE RISK OF THE VIRUS TAKING HOLD IN YOUR BODY -- PREPPING PAP OR BOTH ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS OF OUR EFFORT IN CALIFORNIA TO AND NEW HIV INFECTIONS -- IT WILL BE INCREDIBLY HARD AND PROPS IMPOSSIBLE TO DO IT WITHOUT BROAD ACCESS TO PROP UP. ARE CURRENTLY -- BOTH PROBLEM PAP -- BOTH REQUIRE A PHYSICIAN'S PRESCRIPTION -- WHICH CAN DELAY OR PREVENT SOME PEOPLE FROM ACCESSING IT. SOME PEOPLE AREN'T COMFORTABLE GOING TO SEE A POSITION -- OTHERS STRUGGLE TO ACCESS A DOCTOR -- BECAUSE OF THE POSITION SHORTAGE. OR THEY'RE CONFRONTED WITH LONG DELAYS TO OBTAIN AN APPOINTMENT AND THEN THE ZERO CONVERT AND BECOME POSITIVE. IN THE INTERIM. PARTICULARLY WITH PAT WHERE YOU HAVE TO BEGIN AT WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS OF YOUR EXPOSURE AT THE LATEST THE SOONER THE BETTER -- TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE. IN ITS CURRENT FORM AS AMENDED AND BMP -- THE BILL WILL ALLOW PHARMACISTS TO FURNISH AN INITIAL THIRTY DAY SUPPLY OF PROP. THE PATIENT WILL THEN NEED TO GET THE BLOOD WORK THAT'S REQUIRED AND GO SEE OF A PHYSICIAN. AND GET A PRESCRIPTION FROM THE POSITION IN ORDER TO CONTINUE BEYOND THE THIRTY DAYS. AND SO THAT THIRTY DAY LIMIT -- WE THINK BALANCES THAT WE NEED FOR QUICK ACCESS AND MAKING IT SUPER EASY FOR PEOPLE TO BE CAN. AND THEN. EVENTUALLY TRANSITION INTO A PHYSICIAN'S CARE -- TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS GOING WELL WE THINK THAT THE M. P STRUCK A GOOD BALANCE IN THAT SCOPE OF PRACTICE ISSUE. AND FOR PAP -- THE PHARMACIST WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE FULL -- TWENTY EIGHT DAYS -- SO THE OTHER PIECE OF THE BILL THAT TRIGGER THE HEALTH COMMITTEE -- REFERRAL -- IS -- PUTTING IN AND TWO USELESS AN OBSTRUCTIONIST PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS CAN STEP THERAPY. HARPER PROP AND POP. THESE ARE REQUIREMENTS DO NOTHING OTHER THAN LIMIT ACCESS AND DELAY THE START OF MEDICATION -- WE ARE AWARE OF SITUATIONS WHERE BECAUSE OF A DELAY DUE TO PRIOR AUTHORIZATION SOMEONE TO KNOCK OUT ON THE PROP AND BECAME HIV POSITIVE. WE RECENTLY LEARNED OF AN OUTRAGEOUS SITUATION WHERE AN INSURANCE COMPANY TRY TO IMPOSE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR PAT WOULD YOU HAVE TO START WITHIN. SEVENTY TWO HOURS -- THIS IS AN ACCEPTABLE. BOND THEIR INSURANCE COMPANIES% THAT DON'T REQUIRE PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND WE SHOULD PUT IT INTO LAW -- WITH ME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY -- OR DOCTOR BOB GRANT TO SAY -- PHYSICIAN FACULTY AT THE UNIVERSE A OF CALIFORNIA AT SAN FRANCISCO UCSF. IT IS -- POSSIBLY THE FOREMOST PHYSICIAN EXPERT ON PROP AND PAT AROUND. NOT SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN WITH THISISSUE AND INTO SAYS MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE -- THAN JUST ABOUT ANYONE -- IN ADDITION COURTNEY MARIN PEARSON -- FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO AIDS FOUNDATION ONE OF OUR SPONSORS. CLINT HAWKINS A PHARMACIST WHO IS HERE LOCAL A LOCAL PHARMACIST HERE -- CHEESE PHARMACY AND HAVING MORE AND WITH OUR SPONSOR EQUALITY CALIFORNIA I ASK FOR YOUR RIVAL. WITNESSES SUPPORT YOU GOT TOTAL SIX MINUTES SO THE PEOPLE FIRST KEEP IN MIND -- LIKE IT TO THE END THE LAST PERSON A ROUTE TIME. WILL GO FAST -- MY NAME IS ROBERT GRANT I'M A PRACTICING PHYSICIAN AND A PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE I LED RESEARCH THAT LED TO FDA APPROVAL OF PREP IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE AND BROAD -- CDC RECOMMENDATIONS IN -- TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN I WILL ARGUE THE PREP IS SAFE PHARMACIES CAM PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY AND SAFE PREP -- AND PAP AND THE PHARMACIES ARE WELL POSITIONED TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO ACCESS. AND THE PHARMACISTS AND PHARMACIES ARE WELL SUITED TO PROVIDE PREPPING. IN URGENT SITUATIONS. IS SAFE THE SAFETY OF TREVAN A PREP IS CLEAR THERE'S BEEN NO EPISODES HE CASES OF RENAL FAILURE. NO CASES OF LACTIC ACIDOSIS AND NO CASES OF LIVER FAILURE I MENTION THIS BECAUSE THIS -- BILL HAS -- RECEIVE SOME TESTIMONY TO THE CONTRARY WHICH IS NOT BASED ON EVIDENCE -- DRUG RESISTANCE WITH PURPOSE IS EXCEEDINGLY RARE. AND REALLY MANAGE WITH MODERN HIV THERAPY. THE PHARMACIST CAN PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY AND SAFE HAPPEN PREP THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECTS OF PRO PROVISION ARE ALREADY WITHIN THE PHARMACY WE'LL HOUSE. PHARMACISTS ARE WELL POSITIONED TO IDENTIFY DRUG DRUG INTERACTIONS AND TO ADDRESS THEM PHARMACISTS ARE TRAINED TO COUNSEL CLIENTS REGARDING SIDE EFFECTS AND PROVIDE COACHING FOR HUMANS. OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR SAFE PROPER AS SERVICES ARE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF PHARMACY EXPERTISE. RAPID HIV TESTS THAT ARE CLEAR WAVES ARE AVAILABLE IN PHARMACIES MANY PHARMACIES AND THERE'S PROOF OF CONCEPT THAT THEY CAN DELIVER THIS TESTING SERVICE SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY TO PEOPLE WHO WOULD NOT OTHERWISE -- GET AN HIV TEST. THEY'RE ALSO CLEAR WAVE TESTS -- THAT CAN BE DONE AT THE POINT OF CARE FOR SERUM CREATININE. PHARMACISTS ARE WELL POSITIONED TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO PREP ACCESS -- YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA ONCE SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE TO BE RECEIVING PREP -- AND TO ACCOMPLISH ITS GOAL OF ENDING HIV TRANSMISSION AND YET ONLY 15% OF THEM ARE CURRENTLY ON IT. AND THIS IS NINE YEARS AFTER ACDC LETTER TO ALL PHYSICIANS AS SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD OFFER PREP TO PEOPLE AT SUBSTANTIAL RISK THIS IS. SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE FDA APPROVED IT SO THE MEDICAL COMMUNITIES HAVE HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE PREP TO EVERYONE WHO NEEDS IT. AND WE'RE NINE YEARS INTO THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND ONLY 15% OF PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE ON PROPER GETTING AT I THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE DO SOMETHING ELSE. AND THIS BILL I THINK IT'S A PHARMACY IS NOT PERTINENT TO PUT PREP AND PAP IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO NEEDED -- THE BARRIERS TO PREP ACCESS INCLUDES STATEMENT COSTS AN INCONVENIENCE THE PHARMACY IS ESSENTIALLY ADDRESS ALL OF THESE STATEMENT IS EXPERIENCED IN MANY MEDICAL OFFICES WERE PEOPLE WHO FINALLY GET IN TO SEE THEIR DOCTOR OFTEN TOLD. NO YOU SHOULD JUST BEHAVE BETTER. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE BUT IT DOES HAPPEN COMMUNITY BASED PREP SERVICES BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IN PART BECAUSE THEY'RE LED BY NON PHYSICIANS WORKING IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS THAT REFLECT COMMUNITY VALUES. PHARMACIES ARE ALSO BASED IN COMMUNITIES AND ARE SELECTED BY CLIENTS LARGELY BASED ON PROXIMITY AND CULTURAL TWO MEN TO THEIR NEEDS. THESE INHERENT STRENGTHS IN OUR PHARMACIES CAN AND SHOULD BE LEVERAGED TO PROVIDE HAPPENED PROP AND LASTING. OKAY. SO FINALLY -- PHARMACIES ARE BEST SUITED TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY PAP AND PREP SERVICE. BOTH OF THESE ARE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES PREP INCIDENCES HIGH AFTER SOMEONE HAS ASKED FOR PREP AND THIS IS BEEN DOCUMENTED IN TRIALS AS WELL AS DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS WE ARE BOTH A REQUEST FOR PREP SHOULD BE HANDLED AS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY AND THE PHARMACIST IS IN A GOOD PLACE TO DO. THAT THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS CARDINAL HER PEARSON I'M HERE WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO AIDS FOUNDATION AND WE'RE PROUD CO SPONSORS OF SB. ONE FIFTY NINE WHICH WILL HELP US TO INCREASE PROP ACCESS AND MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS AVAILABLE TO ALL WHO NEED IT. AS DR GRANT MENTIONED PROP UP TAKE IS CURRENTLY -- ADULT -- UNNECESSARY LEE LOW RATE IN CALIFORNIA MUCH LOWER THAN WE NEED IT TO BE IF WE'RE GOING TO ACHIEVE OUR STATED GOALS. OF GETTING TO ZERO NEW HIV INFECTIONS PROP UP TAKE HAS BEEN LOWEST AMONG POPULATIONS THAT MONTH COULD MOST BENEFIT FROM IT INCLUDING BLACK AND THAT NEXT GAME BISEXUAL MEN WOMEN AND YOUTH -- IN THESE COMMUNITIES MAY ALSO EXPERIENCE MULTIPLE BARRIERS TO ACCESSING PROPER INCLUDING STIGMA MEDICAL MISTRUST AN INSUFFICIENT NUMBER FOR FIGHTERS WHO ARE COMFORTABLE WITH -- PRESCRIBING HAPPEN PAT. UNFORTUNATELY MANY INSURANCE PLANS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE A ARE AND IN PLACE AT UNNECESSARY PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS THAT ADD AN ADDITIONAL BARRIER TO CARE FOR THESE POPULATIONS THAT ALREADY ARE -- NOT OF TAKING PROP AS THEY SHOULD AS THEY COULD. FOR EXAMPLE AS SENATOR WIENER MENTION WE RECENTLY LEARNED OF A PATIENT HIS PLAN REQUIRED PRIOR AUTHORIZATION FOR PAT AND HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE PROCESS WOULD TAKE SEVENTY TWO HOURS TO COMPLETE. WHICH MEANS THAT HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO RECEIVE HIS MEDICATION UNTIL AFTER THE EFFECTIVENESS WINDOW FOR PATH HAD CLOSED. MEDI CAL REMOVED THE TAR FOR PREPPING PAP IN TWENTY FOURTEEN BECAUSE THEY SAW THAT IT WAS CAUSING AN UNNECESSARY BARRIER TO CARE. IS WELL PAST TIME FOR THAT AND PRIVATE INSURANCE PLANS IN CALIFORNIA TO FOLLOW SUIT I URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU. IF FIFTY SECONDS. MR KERRY COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M DOCTOR CLICK HOPKINS PHARMACIST OWNER PURCHASE PHARMACY HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE'VE BEEN A PART OF THE COMMITTEE SINCE NINETEEN THIRTY WE KNOW OUR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS BY NAME. AS YOU ALREADY KNOW THE HIV AIDS CRISIS BEGAN NEARLY FOUR DECADES AGO AND UNFORTUNATELY TODAY WE STILL HAVE A CRISIS A DISPROPORTIONATELY IS AFFECTING HISPANIC AND BLACK COMMUNITIES. AS WELL AS WOMEN THESE THE OFTEN FORGOTTEN FACES OF HIV BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT I SEE THEM EACH AND EVERY DAY AT MY PHARMACY. TO PICK UP THEIR HIV MEDICATIONS IS HEARTBREAKING FOR ME TO DISCUSS HIV MEDICATIONS WITH THE NEWLY DIAGNOSED HER PERSON WHEN I KNOW THAT THERE'S MEDICATION AVAILABLE IN THE FORM OF PREP WORK PAP WHICH COULD HAVE PREVENTED THEIR HIV INFECTION -- WHEN THEY WERE EXPOSED THEY DON'T THEY JUST AND HAVE ACCESS TO IT WHEN THEY NEEDED IT? AS MANY PHARMACIST CAN ATTEST TO TAKE A HARPER PRACTICE AGREEMENT WITH THE POSITION IS VERY DIFFICULT AND CAN BE CONSIDERED A BARRIER TO PREP AND HAVE ACCESS. LAWYERS HAVE TO GET INVOLVED TO REVIEW EVERY MINUTE DETAIL WE WERE OUT ACTIVE ISSUE TIME. THANK YOU.

MR CHERYL QUICK -- TIM VALDERRAMA WITH THE WEATHERMAN GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF HEALTH SYSTEM PHARMACISTS -- WE HAVE A SUPPORT OF AMENDED POSITION THAT I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS REAL BRIEFLY OKAY -- I I JUST WANT TO START BY SAYING WE FULLY SUPPORT THE INTENTION THAT SENATOR WIENER HAS WITH THIS BILL -- WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPERATIVE TO GET IT TO GET AS MANY PEOPLE ACCESS TO THIS LIFESAVING MEDICATION AS WE CAN AND WE YOU KNOW WE FULLY BELIEVE THAT THAT PHARMACISTS ARE CAPABLE AND AND FROM WELL TRAINED TO FURNISH THESE MEDICATIONS -- WE DO OF ONE AMENDMENT THAT WE THOUGHT TO THE SENATOR'S OFFICE ABOUT -- THERE'S A PORTION OF THE BILL THAT BASICALLY REQUIRES. THAT THE BOARD OF PHARMACY -- CONSULT WITH ONE PHARMACIST ORGANIZATION -- AS WELL AS THE OFFICE OF AIDS AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE A MORE INCLUSIVE -- IN NEUTRAL POLICY THERE SO THAT THE BOARD OF PHARMACY HAS THE ABILITY TO TALK TO ALL RELEVANT ACTORS -- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE SENATOR ON THAT AS THE BILL MOVES ON THANK YOU. OKAY HOW WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SIX MINUTES CCL STRICTER WAS WITH THE PRO -- EQUALLY STRICT ON THE CON. YOU MAY BEGIN. GOOD EVENING CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- MORTON CARVALLO AT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ON BEHALF OF FORTY FOUR THOUSAND MEMBERS ARE ACROSS THE STATE. I'M HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION AS TWO ONE FIVE NINE AND WHILE WE HAD HOPED -- AT THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THE MEDICAL EXPERTISE NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL ADDRESSED ACCESS IN A WAY. THAT DIDN'T DO THAT DID NOT JEOPARDIZE PATIENT SAFETY UNFORTUNATELY TODAY THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. SIMPLY PUT SB ONE FIVE NINE SIX TO INCREASE ACCESS TO PREP AND PET MEDICATIONS AT A LOWER STANDARD OF CARE. AT RISK FOR EXAMPLE THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW PATIENTS TO TAKE SHORT TERM DOSES OF LONG TERM REGIMENS WHICH IS LIKELY TO HAVE THE RESULT. OF INCREASING THE PATIENT CHALLENGES FOR IT HERE AND SEND THEIR FOR INCREASING THE PATIENT'S OVERALL RISK. THIRTY DAYS LET ME BE CLEAR THAT THIRTY DAYS DOES NOT ENSURE THAT A PATIENT WILL SEE A PHYSICIAN IT DOESN'T SURE THAT THE PATIENT MAY SEE A NOTHER PHARMACISTS TO GET ANOTHER THIRTY DAYS WITHOUT EVER BEING. CONSISTENT OR EVER HAVING THEIR BLOOD TESTED FOR RENAL FUNCTION AND THINGS LIKE THAT. THAT'S A HUGE CONCERN FOR US. AT HEARINGS IS THE KEY TO PREPPING EFFECTIVE. TO BE CLEAR PATIENTS CAN GET PRIVATE A PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE UNDER PRESCRIPTION NOW. WEIRD WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A BILL THAT SAYS IT'S OKAY FOR PATIENTS AT A HIGHER RISK TO NOT SEEK THE ADVICE OR THE GUIDANCE OF VISITATION. THE MEDICATION AND PREP CANNOT BE TAKEN WITHOUT ONGOING MONITORING AND TREATMENT TASKS AND TREATMENT TASK THAT CANNOT BE DONE AT A RETAIL PHARMACY AND WHEN IT BE DONE UNDER SB. ONE FIVE NINE AS THREE ONE FIVE NINE FAILS TO RECOGNIZE AS AND FAILS TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE AT AN INCREASED RISK. CMA HAD HOPED TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO EFFECTIVELY EXPAND ACCESS TO THE ME IN A MEANINGFUL WAY. TO PAP MEDICATION WHICH IS THE POST EXPOSURE MEDICATION -- UNFORTUNATELY ROOM REMAIN OPPOSED WITH SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT PATIENT SAFETY AND IT HERE AND COMPLIANCE RELATED TO PROP. I TODAY I HAVE DOCTOR CAN BASH WITH ME WHO IS AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST AND ALL IN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN FRONT OF YOU I'M ALREADY INTIMIDATED AM HOW MAKE IT BACK I'M AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE PHYSICIAN I'VE BEEN PRACTICING THE SACRAMENTO REGION. FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS -- HE WHY'D YOU KNOW PRACTICING EVERY DAY AND HAVING TO TELL PEOPLE WHEN THEY ARE DIAGNOSED WITH AT AND ILLNESS THAT I DO NOT HAVE A QUEUE FOR THEY HAVE TO LIVE WITH ALL THEIR LIFE IT'S DEVASTATING. ACTUALLY SOMETHING I HI I ALWAYS AFRAID OF DOING EVERY TIME HOWEVER -- I DID HAVE TO TELL QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO CAME SEEKING PREP THAT THERE AND FORTUNATELY. INFECTED THEY NEED TREATMENT NOT PROPHYLAXIS -- I'M TRYING IN THE INTEREST OF TIME TO GO WITH OUTSIDE THAT TREATING POINTS. SO THESE PEOPLE IF HE HAD RECEIVED THE PREP. TREATMENT WHICH IS NOW E. BACK BORN INDEED GUIDELINES CALLED OF TREATMENT THEY'LL BE RECEIVING SUB OPTIMAL TREATMENT FOR ESTABLISHED INFECTION THEY WON'T BE PROFIT LEXUS. AND THAT WOULD BE THE RISK OF INFECTION. ALSO SEE FREQUENTLY PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN RUSHED. TO TREATMENT FOR AT THE HIV VIRUS BOARD PROPHYLAXIS WHEN THEY WERE NOT IN THE BRIGHT STATE JUST TO SEE THEM IN AND OUT AND REGIMEN WITH INTERRUPTIONS. AND THIS IS AN ENORMOUS FACTOR -- FOR RESISTANCE AND LOSING DIFFICULTY OF THE TREATMENT AND THE STUDIES THAT WOULD BE WHERE. THE PIECES OF APPROVING PREP TREATMENT BY THE CDC AT TERRENCE. REEDY WAS THE MAIN FACTOR TO DETERMINE EFFICACY. AND OF COURSE LOSING THE EFFICACY OF THE MEDICATION WILL NOT ONLY -- MAKE A LOSS TO THE PEOPLE USING FOR PROPHYLAXIS BUT ALSO FOR THOSE TWO USING A FOR TREATMENT. THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE. REAL. AND ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOT VERY FREQUENT WHEN THEY HAPPEN THEY'RE DIFFICULT TO TO RECOGNIZE BECAUSE A PROVIDERS WHO ARE NOT PRACTICING. IN THE AREA OF A CHEVY MAY NOT SEE IT EASILY AND IS NOT UNIQUE -- THE OTHER FACTOR THAT IS THE IT IS THE USUALLY THE SERVICES ARE BUNDLED WITH OTHER. INTERVENTIONS AND COUNSELING -- TO REDUCE THE REST OF THE PATIENT. IN ADDITION TO LAB MONITORING. AND I CANNOT IMAGINE A TOPIC THAT IS MORE INTIMATE AND SENSITIVE DISCUSSION THEN THE RISK FACTORS FOR HIV INFECTION FOR IT TO BE DISCUSSED IN A PHARMACY SETTING. RESEARCHER MEMBERS RAND MARTIN ON BEHALF OF THE AIDS HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION FIRST WE SUPPORT THE PEP AND PRIOR AUTHORIZATION -- PIECES OF THIS BILL WHOLEHEARTEDLY WE THINK THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT. I'M SECOND H. US PERSPECTIVE ON CRAFT HAS EVOLVED OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS -- TO THE POINT WHERE WE ARE NOW ONE OF THE LARGEST DISPENSERS OF PREP -- IN THE COUNTRY AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE LARGEST -- PREP PROGRAM IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIVE PROGRAM -- HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF PREP WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CDC THE P. H.. FTA AND EVEN GILLY ADS -- GUIDELINES RELATIVE TO WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE PRESS IS PRESCRIBED -- AND WE'RE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA OF ABANDONING THAT EVEN FOR THIRTY DAYS -- IT HERE IN SAYS YOU'VE HEARD IS A IS A MAJOR ISSUE I'M IN OUR PROGRAM IN FLORIDA WE DID A STUDY OF ELEVEN HUNDRED OF OUR PATIENTS -- AND THESE PEOPLE RECEIVE VERY INTENSE OVERSIGHT BY OUR STAFF -- A THIRD OF THEM IN THE FIRST THIRTY DAYS OF TAKING PREP STOPPED BEING ADHERENT -- TAKING THE POSITION OF THE CLINICIAN OUT OF THE PICTURE -- FOR THE FIRST THIRTY DAYS AS SB ONE FIFTY NINE INDICATES WHAT HAPPENED -- WE BELIEVE -- REDUCES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PATIENT TO TO BE IT HERE AND HERE IT IS IMPORTANT NOT ONLY FOR THE HEALTH OF THE PATIENT BUT ALSO FOR THE PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE IF THEY BECOME EDUCATED. AM I DONE. I SEE YOUR FACE OKAY I THINK IF YOU OTHER WITNESSES REPORT JUST NAME ORGANIZATION POSITION. THE MADDEN REPRESENT OPPOSITION SORRY. REPRESENT CALIFORNIA CHAPTER THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. BRENT SPENCER WITH AMERICAN COLLEGE OBGYN STRYCHNINE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU.

SHE SAID. I GUESS I WANT TO GUARANTEE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GO FIND A PHYSICIAN AND GET TREATMENT INSTEAD OF JUST GOING TO ANOTHER PHARMACIST I HAVE TO GET A THIRTY DAY SUPPLY DO WE HAVE A MONITORING SOMEONE IS GETTING THE SAFEST TREATMENT POSSIBLE OR CAN THEY GO. JUST TO ANOTHER PHYSICIAN. A PHARMACIST I APOLOGIZE NOT A PHYSICIAN AND GET ENOUGH WEIGHT ON IT WE'RE NOT PUTTING LIKE A TAG ON YOU KNOW RIGHT. ABOUT THE NOTES SO THAT THEY CAN ADD ANOTHER PHARMACY -- YOU KNOW I I THINK -- WHAT THE BILL REQUIRESFIRST OF ALL IT'S IT'S BIGGER THE BILL REQUIRES YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN HIV NEGATIVE TEST WITHIN SEVEN DAYS BEFORE -- AND YOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT TO THE PHARMACIST. BY. GUYS ARE JUST TO BE CLEAR THE BILL AS A GUARD RAIL AROUND DIES SO THAT TESTIMONY THAT YOU HEARD. WAS A LITTLE ODD TO ME SINCE THE BILL SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES AN EIGHT SEVEN NEGATIVE SEVEN SEVEN DAYS -- AND THEN THE PHARMACIST HAS TO GIVE YOU. A UNCH OF INFORMATION INCLUDING INFORMATION ABOUT POSITIONS AGO TOO AND IN ORDER THE BLOOD WORK. AND SO YOU CAN GO DOWN THE STREET IS A LAP CORE WHATEVER DOWN THE STREET GET THE BLOOD WORK AND THEN. YOU HAVE TO GO TO A PHYSICIAN WITHIN THIRTY DAYS TO CONTINUE. ON YOU KNOW I THINK PEOPLE WHO HAVE TAKEN THE STOCK TO OUT SHE SAID I WANT TO BE ON CRAFT -- THESE ARE NOT YOU THE I THINK WE AT SOMEONE NEED TO TRUST PEOPLE. TO CARE ABOUT THEIR HEALTH -- AND KNOWING THAT AND GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEED TO SEE A PHYSICIAN AND A HALF OF BLOOD WORK -- YOU PEOPLE COULD THEY'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE -- IRRESPONSIBLE AND LIFE. BUT WE KNOW THATMOST PEOPLE AREN'T AND PEOPLE WANT TO BE HEALTHY AND THEY'RE GOING TO THE PHARMACIST TO GET THAT PROP BECAUSE THEY WANT TO STAY HEALTHY. THE PHARMACIST WILL GIVE THEM INFORMATION ABOUT THE NEED TO SEE A DOCTOR IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE IN THE GET THE BLOOD WORK. AND SO AT SOME POINT -- YOU KNOW WE NEED TO I THINK THIS NEED TO TRUST INDIVIDUALS. TO TAKE OWNERSHIP OF THEIR OWN HEALTH AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT PRACTICE ABOUT -- AND THAT'S WHY WE WORK SO HARD TO REMOVE BARRIERS AND YOU SAW SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SPENT THEIR LIFE TRYING TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO PRACTICE. AND THE UPTAKE IS STILL NOT THERE I'M PARTICULARLY AND AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO COMMUNITIES. IT IS. IS HAS SHOCKINGLY LOW AND HIV INFECTION RATES ARE HIGHER. AND SO WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO EXPAND ACCESS. AND TO MAKE IT EASY FOR PEOPLE TO START AND UNFORTUNATELY YOU KNOW WHEN I WHEN I WENT ON THE PRODUCT AND I PUBLICLY DISCLOSE THAT -- ABOUT UNDER FIVE YEARS AGO NOW -- I WAS VERY LUCKY I WENT TO A POSITION WHO. DOES IMMEDIATELY GOT IT DIDN'T JUDGE ME THAT AND TRY TO SHAME ME THAT AND TRY. TO YOU KNOW TELL ME -- JUST BE RESPONSIBLE -- AND I WAS LUCKY. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE BECAUSE ALTHOUGH MANY POSITIONS ARE VERY GOOD ON SEXUAL HEALTH ISSUES WE STILL HAVE TOO MANY PHYSICIANS WHO ARE NOT COMFORTABLE EVEN TALKING ABOUT IT -- AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THAT AND TO GIVE PEOPLE AS MANY OPTIONS AS POSSIBLE PEOPLE CAN STILL CHOOSE IN A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE. TO GO TO A PHYSICIAN HE SAID I WANT TO SEE A POSITION BEFORE I DO ANYTHING AND THAT'S GREAT -- BUT WE WANT TO JUST CREATE MORE OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE SO THAT'S WHAT IT'S ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AGAIN I DO APPRECIATE YOUR I APPRECIATE THE BILL I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THERE IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO. SO I GUESS -- I DID A QUESTION MY COLLEAGUE WHO IS A PHARMACIST AND I ASK MINE INTERPRETATION OR WHAT I THOUGHT AS YOU COULD GET A PRESCRIPTION WITHOUT A A PHYSICIAN SAYING YOU KNOW RIGHT THIS PRESCRIPTION. DOCTOR PAN WOULD TELL DOCTORS OR PHYSICIANS DOWNERS PHARMACIST DOWN TO GET A PRESCRIPTION YOU WISH YOU BUT APPARENTLY. MISTER A STONE IN HIS PHARMACIST ACTED ISSUE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR CERTAIN THINGS WITHOUT. A PHYSICIAN'S AUTHORIZATION AND AND I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW THAT SO THAT WAS AN EDUCATION THING FOR ME. BUT SOMEHOW I THINK THAT. SOMEBODY'S GOVERNING AS WHETHER IT'S THE CDC OR WHATEVER SOMEBODY'S GOVERNESS AND IF YOU ADD PRESCRIPTIONS OR YOU ADD. ADDITIONAL MEDICATIONS THAT CAN BE DISTRIBUTED BY APART BY A PHARMACIST WITHOUT. A PRESCRIPTION FROM OF A PHYSICIAN DOES THAT HAVE TO HAVE NEW STATUTES GUIDELINES OR CAN WE JUST AS LEGISLATORS SAY. CENTERS THERE STONE IN HIS PHARMACIST CAPACITY COULD ISSUE ANY TYPE OF MEDICATION EVER WITHOUT ANY OVERSIGHT. OKAY THE THE THIRD LEGISLATION THE BILL DIRECTS THE PHARMACY BOARD -- TO ISSUE -- GUIDELINES IN THE RULES AND REGULATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S DONE APPROPRIATELY -- SO THERE THERE WILL BE AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS I AFTERWARDS AND AND YOU'RE RIGHT AND CENTER STONE WAS RIGHT THAT THE LEGISLATURE FROM TIME TO TIME DOES AUTHORIZE -- PHARMACISTS TO PROVIDE MEDICATION WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION -- YOUR VACCINES -- IS ONE OF THEM YOU CAN GO AND GET A VACCINE FROM A PHARMACIST WITHOUT SAYING A POSITION THAT WAS A FIGHT. IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES AND THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION FOUGHT THAT AND OPPOSED. TO AND THEN. AND THEN THE LEGISLATURE PUT A WHOLE BUNCH OF REQUIREMENTS ON IT SO THAT IT WAS NOT A VERY SUCCESSFUL BILL. AND IN FIVE YEARS AGO THE LEGISLATURE REMOVED THOSE REQUIREMENTS TO MAKE IT EASIER AND MORE SEAMLESS FOR PEOPLE TO GET A VACCINATION. FROM PHARMACISTS PHARMACIST CAN -- PROVIDE -- THE LOCKS AND NOR CAN -- WITHOUT A PRESCRIPTION TO SOMEONE WHO IS EXPERIENCING -- AN OVERDOSE -- OF COURSE BIRTH CONTROL THE PHARMACIST CAN PROVIDE A BIRTH CONTROL. PILLS WITHOUT A DOCTOR'S PRESCRIPTION THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THEY'RE ENTITLED TO DO IT THESE ARE IMPORTANT ISSUES AND THEY'RE AN IMPORTANT VOICE THEY OPPOSE THAT BILL-- AND THE LEGISLATURE ADOPTED A BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR WOMEN TO HAVE THAT ACCESS AND NOT HAVE. TO YOU KNOW AND JUST TRY TO REMOVE AS MANY BARRIERS AS WE CAN WE TRUST. YOU KNOW WOMEN TO MAKE THOSE YOUR HEALTH DECISIONS SO WE DO DO THAT FROM TIME TO TIME AND I THINK THIS IS AN APPROPRIATE -- SITUATION BUT THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU CENTER. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR -- PHARMACISTS ARE. OVERLY TRAINING UNDER UTILIZED AS WE'VE KNOWN THAT FOR YEARS AND SO FAR MY COLLEAGUES WILL WILL KNOW THE THE ENTRY LEVEL DEGREE NOW AND AND PHARMACY AS A PHARMACY DEGREE DOCTOR OF PHARMACY DEGREE. WHICH IS A CLINICAL PHARMACY -- POSITION WERE. I ACTUALLY DID ROUNDS WITH MEDICAL STUDENTS AT THE COUNTY HOSPITAL AND WE ARE WE ARE TRAINED WITH THEM. AND WE TAKE A LOT OF THE SAME CLASSES THAT THEY TAKE SOMETIMES BY THE SAME PROFESSORS ANATOMY HISTOLOGY PHYSIOLOGY. PHARMACOLOGY BY A MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY -- AND IN FACT -- WE'RE WE'RE TRAINED ACTUALLY. READ BLOOD TESTS AND IS ACTUALLY A PART OF THE BOARD EXAM THAT WE CAN. INTERPRET THESE TESTS AND WE CAN EVEN ORDER THESE TESTS SO -- DOCTOR YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT -- SOME OF THE WARNING SAID. THE CMA AS PUT FORWARD IS SAID TO YOU COULD OF RENAL TOXICITY IN A PADDOCK. TOXICITY AND AND USE ANY SCRAPS OF YOUR NOT BEING TRACKED -- YOU SAID YOU YOU YOU WE HAVE A SINGLE ONE REPORTED CASE OF ANY TYPE OF TOXICITY IMPROPER PAP WHICH I WOULD TO ME WAS A WAS VERY VERY POWERFUL HOWEVER. NOW WE DON'T TAKE ANY CHANCES WHEN A PATIENT COMES IN AND ONE THING THAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT PEP IN PRACTICE TIMELINESS AGAIN ACUTENESS GETTING THE PATIENT ON THEM. ESPECIALLY WITH PREP RIGHT AWAY AND WITHIN THREE DAYS ON ON A PATH OF THE WISE THE THE THE PATIENT IS AT RISK OF ACQUIRING -- AIDS TO SO -- SENATOR WIENER -- THIS IS NOT A A UNIQUE IDEA. THE PHARMACISTS ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THESE MEDICATIONS -- IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THIS IS AVAILABLE. AS YOU'RE PROPOSING IT AT THE STATE'S IS THAT CORRECT. ON IT IS -- IN NEW YORK. AND WASHINGTON STATE -- NEAR BECAUSE PAT. AND WASHINGTON STATE IS MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF OF OF PROP OKAY -- ALSO A RESPONSE ALSO TO THE DOCTOR THERE'S RESERVE SPECTER HAD ATTIC AND WERE IN RENO TOXICITIES THERE IS A NEW DRUG IS BEING PROPOSED TO BE RELEASED BY THE FD AT OUR OFFICE OUT YET. BUT IS A MARKETED TO HAVE LESS -- READ ON HEPATIC TOXICITY COULD BE COULD SPEAK ON THAT -- DRUG IT ONLY. I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO A DRUG -- BRANDED AS DISCO V. IT'S A ANOTHER VERSION OF TEN OFF OF HERE THAT -- IS -- IN THE TREATMENT SETTING KNOWN -- TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH LESS FREQUENT -- FACTS ON THE KIDNEY -- IN THE SETTING OF PREP WE HAVE NOT SEEN RENAL FAILURE -- ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDE A PROP THE CURRENT FORMULATION THE NEW FORMULATION -- WILL HAVE TO BE EVALUATED BY THE FDA TO SEE HOW MUCH IT ADDS IF ANYTHING TO THE EXISTING STANDARD OF CARE FOR NOW WE HAVE PROVIDE A IT IS SAFE. AND IT IS SIMILAR TO BIRTH CONTROL PILLS AND VACCINATIONS AS A PROPHYLACTIC INTERVENTION THAT HAS BEEN SAFELY PROVIDED BY PHARMACISTS SO IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF PATIENT CARE -- THE PHARMACISTS IS GOING TO BE ORDERING BLOOD TESTS AND AND A MODIFIED LAB AND IS REFERRING A PATIENT TO THEIR DOCTOR AND IF THEY DON'T HAVE A DOCTOR THE BY THE BILLIARD BEGINNING A LIST OF PHYSICIANS AND THEY CAN GO SEE. TO TO FOLLOW UP WE WANT THEM TO FOLLOW UP THAT TO TO MAKE SURE THE BABY COMING DISEASE FREE -- ALSO. YOU KNOW WE DON'T JUST MAGICALLY SAY THE PHARMACIST COULD START DOING ALL THESE THINGS WITHOUT ADDITIONAL TRAINING SO. IN ORDER FOR PHARMACISTS TO TO GIVE IMMUNIZATIONS WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH. MORE COURSE WORK WE HAVE TO BE CERTIFIED. BEFORE WE CAN DO IT. WE GET A CERTIFICATE. SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD. THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY IS GOING TO COME UP WITH A CURRICULUM AND WORKING WITH MAYBE SOME OF THE AGENCIES THAT WERE DISCUSSED BEFORE. TO ENSURE THAT THE PHARMACIST TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM UNDERSTAND. THE PROTOCOLS AND EIGHT IN AND FOLLOW THROUGH IN ACCORDANCE WITH. PHARMACY LAW WHICH WILL BE ENFORCED BY THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY. THE PART THAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS BILLS IF THERE'S FIVE THOUSAND NEW CASES OF AIDS EVERY SINGLE YEAR AND BE OUT ONE POINT ONE MILLION PEOPLE. THAT ARE POTENTIALLY INFECTED AND VERY FEW LIKE 10% ARE EVEN OUT THERE GETTING CRAP. AND THAT'S AN ACCESS ISSUE. WE HAVE OVER FIVE THOUSAND PHARMACIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE PHARMACIES THAT ARE OPEN TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. AND ONE DOESN'T PLAN ALWAYS -- ACTS OF PASSION SOMETIMES THINGS JUST HAPPEN OKAY AND IF YOU DE PREP -- EIGHTY PROPERTY THE TAP YOU NEED PAP [inaudible] AND AGAIN WE GET BACK INTO THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION TO TAKE TIME THESE ARE NOW REALLY TIME SENSITIVE. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU. ARE GOING THROUGH YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO PREVENT YOUR HEALTH FROM -- DETERIORATING SO -- I WANT TO COMMEND YOU SENATOR WIENER -- FOR BRING IN THIS FORWARD -- I KNOW THERE'S A GOAL TO HAVE WHO SHOULD HAVE ZERO WE NEED ELIMINATE AIDS MIKEY BUT LIKE WE ELIMINATED POLIO -- WE WE'VE GOT THE DRUGS THAT ARE ARE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. WE HAVE PROOF THAT PHARMACIST CAN HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TAKE ON MORE PROFESSIONAL ROLES OF PRESCRIBING IN AND GIVING IMMUNIZATIONS AND I THINK THAT'S LARGELY. A SUCCESS THAT WE'VE GOTTEN MORE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY ELDERLY PEOPLE WITH FLU VACCINES GETTING THE FLU THE FLU SHOT AND AND PREVENTING MORBIDITY MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OR PNEUMOCOCCAL -- INJECTION FOR ELDERLY PEOPLE WERE MANY THAN DIE FROM PNEUMONIA WINTER ELDERLY -- WE'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS IMPACT IN THAT ACCESSIBILITY I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT -- SO -- WITH WE WE WE'VE GOT TO STOP SILO IN HEALTH CAR. ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE A PRIMARY CARE SHORTAGE -- IN IN THE STATE IN IN IN THE COUNTRY - I THINK WITH THE APPROPRIATE PROTOCOLS OF THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY CAN DO -- AND AND THE INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY ESPECIALLY IN AREAS OF COLOR WHERE WE SEE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE CHAU PREPONDERANCE OF OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GETTING AIDS -- UNKNOWINGLY -- WITHOUT KNOWING IT THESE THESE THESE PREPARATIONS ARE AVAILABLE -- I THINK WE CAN REDUCE THE MORBIDITY -- AND AND AND LONG TERM SATINS OF PATIENTS SAID IT WILL COME DOWN WITH AIDS IT DIDN'T HAVE TO COME DOWN WITH AIDS. AND SO -- CENTER THANK YOU FOR BRINGING A FOR A AYE AYE. I WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT TO TO MOVE THE BILL I SUPPORT IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY -- AND AND I KNOW THAT -- THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION WAS HERE THEY SUPPORTED I THINK. I WANT TO COMMEND YOU -- DOCTOR ON YOUR PHARMACY IN ALL YOUR GOOD WORK. AND ALSO ONE AND CAN SAN FRANCISCO THAT I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WITH THAT WAS -- DOING A LOT OF GREAT WORK AS WELL THANKS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS. OKAY. HE ACTUALLY SENATOR DRAWS SO THE NEXT. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS -- ONE IS AN EXCUSE BECAUSE I'D. DON'T KNOW ALL OF THE TERMINOLOGY OR THE ISSUES -- SPECIFIC MEDICAL ISSUES. BUT MY QUESTION IS -- THE WHAT ARE THE RISKS INVOLVED TO GET PREP AND PAP WITHOUT MEDICAL SUPERVISION WITHOUT A DOCTOR'S SUPERVISION. I KNOW YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE NOT LOOKING TO DO SHORT CUTS I KNOW YOU'RE NOT. IGNORING THE HEALTH OF ANYONE WHO ASKS FOR THE THE TREATMENT. BUT HOWEVER YOU BALANCED. ANY POTENTIAL RISKS WITH. SO THERE ARE -- HE KNEW -- TO RISKS TO BE MOST AWARE OF ONE IS TO MAKE SURE YOUR ONE THE PERSON TO BE HIV NEGATIVE. WHEN THEY GO ON TO PROP -- BECAUSE AND THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU'RE ON PROP -- YOU YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GET TESTED FOR HIV REGULARLY BECAUSE IF YOU BECOME POSITIVE NEED TO STOP. GRABBING GO ON TO HIV MEDICATIONS -- AND THAT'S WHY -- THE CDC -- HAS THE RECOMMENDATION THAT YOU TEST NEGATIVE WITHIN SEVEN DAYS BEFORE AND THAT'S WHY WE PUT THAT REQUIREMENT -- INTO THE BILL I THE OTHER RISK WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS IT'S AN EXTREMELY SMALL RISK. IS AN EXTREMELY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO GO ON TO PROP OR PERHAPS THEY CAN HAVE A CAN OF A REGIONAL -- IMPACT THEIR KIDNEYS I THAT IS VERY RARE -- THERE AND AS WE KNOW ON PRETTY MUCH ANY DRUGS THAT YOU TAKE INCLUDING OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS THERE'S A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO COULD HAVE. THE HEALTH BECAUSE OF THE SMALL RISK ON BY -- AND SO YOU ARE REQUIRED TO GET -- BLOODWORK TEST FOR RENAL FUNCTION AND SO THAT'S WHY WE IN THE BILL IN ORDER TO GO PAST THE THIRTY DAYS ON ALL YOU HAVE TO SEE A DOCTOR BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE HAD. THE BLOOD WORK ON FOR PATTODAY -- AND AND RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF HOW PEOPLE GET UP WHICH IS SUCH AN INEFFICIENT WAYS. ARE YOU GO TO THE ER. ZERO KERR A WHOLE YEAR NOT EVERY RIGHT THAT THE PEOPLE. OFTEN DO YOU GIVE LIKE I THINK I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO GO TO THE ER. AND YOU GET UP TO ABOUT ONE AND THAT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE WAY TO DO IT -- AND THEN THEY WILL ORDER THE BLOOD WORK AND YOU KNOW IT TAKES AWHILE TO GET BLOOD WORK DONE TYPICALLY SO YOU START THE PAP BEFORE YOU HAVE THE BLOOD WORK. IN THAT SITUATION -- SO WE IN BE MPV MEMON SO WE WORKED OUT WITH THE COMMITTEE TRY TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE -- AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT WITH -- YOU GET THIRTY DAYS A PROP AND AND THEN IN THAT THIRTY DAY PERIOD GET THE BLOOD WORK GO SEE A PHYSICIAN IN ORDER TO CONTINUE STRIKING A BALANCE. ANOTHER QUESTION IS YOU MENTION THE TREATMENT WAS IS FOR TWENTY EIGHT DAYS -- CAPITA TWENTY EIGHT DAYS AND THEN YOU'RE DONE. OKAY I GUESS A I HEARD YOU SAYING WELL YOU WOULD GET THE TREATMENT FOR THIRTY DAYS THE PHARMACIST TO GIVE YOU WHY WOULD YOU GO BEYOND I DON'T UNDERSTAND SO I'M SUCH AN EIGHT DAYS AND THIRTY TWO OTHERS. PRODUCT WHICH IS PRE EXPOSURE MOBILE ACCESS -- PAT IS POST EXPOSURE -- PAP POST EXPOSURE IT'S A SOME PEOPLE MAY THE COMPARISON TO THE MORNING AFTER PILL. IT'S SO YOU SOME SOMETHING HAPPENS YOU THINK THAT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN EPOSED SO YOU THEN GET WHEN A TWENTY EIGHT DAY-COURSE YOU TAKE IT ONCE. EVERY DAY FOR TWENTY EIGHT DAYS AND THEN YOU'RE DONE. AND IT REDUCES THE RISK OF THE VIRUS TAKING HOLD THAT'S IF YOU THINK YOU'VE BEEN EXPOSED A ONE TIME THING FOR TWENTY DAYS. FOR PRESS -- WHICH IS YOU DON'T THINK YOU BEEN EXPOSING YOU TEST NEGATIVE -- BUT YOU WANT TO STAY NEGATIVE AND YOU WANT TO INCREASE YOUR PROTECTION -- YOU TAKE A POTENTIALLY INDEFINITELY -- AS JUST A REGULAR PILL THAT YOU TAKE EVERY DAY -- AND SO I'VE FROM FOR ME IF THE LAST FIVE YEARS EVERYDAY I TAKE PILL IN THE MORNING WITH MY COFFEE -- AND HI -- AND THAT'S AND AND SOME PEOPLE GO ON AND OFF DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY ARE IN THEIR LIFE -- AND BUT IT'S A MORE ONGOING THING. FINALLY JUST -- I JUST WANT TO SAY WITH WITH ALL DUE RESPECT -- AND I'M. YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT SUPPORT -- THE BILL I ALSO HAS FRIENDS OF MINE -- WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED ESPECIALLY IN THE VERY EARLY DAYS OF EXPOSING THE URGENCY BEHIND THE -- EIGHT HIV AIDS AN EPIDEMIC -- AND THE FAILURE OF THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY TO RESPOND AS QUICKLY AS THEY SHOULD OF LIKE. CLEVE JONES GOOD GOOD FRIEND OF MINE AND ON OTHERS -- ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR BILL SO. IN ADDITION TO EVERYBODY ELSE I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU THANK YOU. APPRECIATE THAT I THINK -- BROKERAGE GENERATION OF OF PEOPLE WHO WENT THROUGH THE THE ABSOLUTE WORSE THE EPIDEMIC UNDER LONG TERM SURVIVORS AND YOU KNOW WAS WISHING THAT IN THOSE EARLY DAYS WE HAVE HAD ACCESS TO THOSE. THANK YOU FOR THAT. ESPECIALLY CENTER RUBIO. MY QUESTION HAS BEEN ANSWERED THANK YOU RIGHT WILL CENTER LEYVA THEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. GOOD EVENING SENATOR WIENER I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR EXTREMELY HARD WORK ON THIS BILL I SAID THROUGH THE DISCUSSION IN BMP. AND I THINK YOU'VE BEEN VERY THOUGHTFUL -- BUT I ALSO HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES THAT THIS IS ABOUT ACCESS AND IT'S ABOUT ACCESS. FOR FOLKS IN THE LGBT Q. COMMUNITY BUT I ALSO THINK ABOUT A WOMAN WHO'S BEEN RAPED. AND SHE WHAT WE HAVE FOUND AND I THINK MOST OF US KNOW IS MOST WOMEN ARE RAPED FEEL THAT IT WAS THEIR FAULT AND THEY'RE EMBARRASSED AND THEY MAY NOT WANT TO GO TO THE DOCTOR. SO TO BE ABLE TO GO TO A PHARMACIST AND ACCESS PAP -- WOULD BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL. I KNOW OF ONE WOMAN IN MY DISTRICT WHO COULDN'T EVEN GET PAP THROUGH HER AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM. AND BY THE TIME SHE WAS FINALLY -- GIVEN THE PRODUCT IT WAS PASSED THE SEVENTY TWO HOURS SO IT WAS NOT REALLY EVEN EFFECTIVE FOR HER -- AND I THINK THAT. IF IF WE IF THERE IS A WAY FOR US TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM GETTING HIV WHY IN GOD'S NAME WOULD WE NOT FIND A WAY TO DO THAT. I MEAN THAT IS INCUMBENT UPON EACH AND EVERYONE OF US AND YOU KNOW I KNOW THE OPPOSITION SAID THAT THEY'RE WORRIED THAT THEY MIGHT THEY MIGHT GO TO DIFFERENT PHARMACIES AND THEY MIGHT NOT GO TO THE DOCTOR. IN MY MIND THAT'S A SMALL CONCERNED BECAUSE IF THEY'RE GOING AND THEY'RE GETTING SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO KEEP THEM FROM GETTING SICK AND POSSIBLY DYING. THEN WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WITHIN OUR POWER TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO THESE MEDICATIONS SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK I THANK YOU FOR YOUR DOG AT WORK BECAUSE I KNOW THIS HAS NOT BEEN EASY. AGAIN I WOULD FOR SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY [inaudible] SENATE MITCHELL. THANK YOU -- I'M SORRY THAT I'M THE ONE THAT KEEPS ATHLETES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MAMMOTH I'M I'M. NOT AT MY PEAK. I'M NOT ENVIRONMENT OFFICE IN. ARE THESE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED BY THESE ARE THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE THESE YOUR MOVEMENTS. SO THEY ARE -- I WOULD SAY THEY'RE MORE OUR AMENDMENTS THAT WE WORKED ON WITH THE COMMITTEE ONE IS -- THAT APPEARS AN ANALYSIS -- IS -- TO IS TO PROHIBIT REQUIRING MAIL ORDER YES IMPROPER THAT'S AN ANALYSIS AND THEN TWO OTHER ONES THAT WE WORKED ON WITH THE COMMITTEE THEY'RE NOT IN THE ANALYSIS -- PROHIBIT -- HEALTH PLANS FROM PROHIBITING PHARMACY. FOR HAVING HEALTH PLANS AND TV ARMS. FROM PROHIBITING PHARMACISTS FROM. BOB PROVIDING PROBLEM TOP GOT A THERE IS A THE THE HEALTH PLAN CAN SAY WE'RE NOT COVERING IT UP THE PHARMACIST I DOES IT. AND AND ALSO SOME -- ARE CLARIFYING NUMBER OUT OF WORK -- SO WE WORKED WITH -- THE WINDOWS AMENDMENTS WITH -- HEALTH MAY STAFF TO HELP DISTRACT THEM. AND THE THREE MODELS OF THE THREE AND DID AND I I DIDN'T HEAR ALL OF THE OPPOSITION COMMENTS DID YOU HAVE ANY TWENTY YEARS AT THIS REMOVE. ANY OF YOUR OPPOSITION. NO THERE WAS A ONE OF THE PHARMACY ASSOCIATIONS -- IS CONTINUING TO TALK WITH US THERE IS SON THERE IS SOME ABOUT THE MINISTER. DURATION OF THE BILL IN TERMS OF WHO'S INVOLVED VERY DIALOGUING WITH US ABOUT THE AND WILL CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THANK YOU. AND JUST FOR CLARIFICATION THERE WAS ANOTHER MOMENT THAT I SAW FROM THE AUTHOR THAT YOU DO NOT ACCEPT SO -- AND RIGHT SO YEAH THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT PRINT RIGHT CORRECT AND MAYBE PERHAPS I SHOULD ELABORATE ON THAT WAS GONNA WAIT TILL THE END IS THE CHAIR BUT I THINK THE CONCERN -- THAT -- THAT I HAD AND IT'S ARTS THE US THE FOLLOW UP SO -- I SHOULD CENTER WIENER I MEAN I SHARE YOUR DESIRE TO TRY TO GET. ACCESS TO THESE MEDICATIONS TO PEOPLE'S QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IN MANY WAYS I THINK -- WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE CMA IS AND MORE SO MY PHYSICIAN COLLEAGUES ARE? LITTLE MORE LEANING TOWARD WHERE YOU ARE BUT THE PRT THAT I HAD CONCERNED ABOUT AND SO. IS THAT WHAT WE HAVE A PHARMACIST TO YOU KNOW FIND GO THE PHARMACIST HAVING DISPENSED MEDICATION. THE CDC GUIDELINES DO REQUIRE -- AND THAT'S WHY BEING P.. I GUESS INCLUDE IN THEIR AMENDMENTS THAT RESEMBLE THE PHARMACIST HAS TO ORDER A BLOOD TEST FOR THE KIDNEY. NOT OFFERS KIDNEY FUNCTION -- NOW. THE I THINK TO ME THE CHALLENGES IS THAT. IT'S IF YOU ORDER A KIDNEY FUNCTION TESTS IT'S NOT NECESSARY JUST GONNA COME BACK AS A CREATININE YOU MAY GET BACK A CHEM SEVEN SO WITH ALL THAT THE PARTS RIGHT -- THE STUDIES THAT LOOKED AT KIDNEY DYSFUNCTION SAID YES VERY LOW RATES BUT ACTUALLY WENT THINGS THEY POINT OUT IS IN THE STUDIES -- THAT DAY DID EXAMINE THAT THE POPULATION IT LOOKED AT WHERE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE PRE EXISTING KIDNEY FUNCTION PROBLEMS SO THAT WAS ACTUALLY MADE NOTE OF IN THE TO REPORT. AND SO MY CONCERN IS IN TERMS OF CLOSING THE LOOP IS IS THAT OKAY YOU HAVE SOMEONE COME IN TO GET THE PRESCRIPTION PHARMACISTS ORDER A TEST RIGHT. THE TEST COMES BACK AND THERE'S AN ABNORMALITY ON THE TEST AND THE PHARMACIST MAYOR MAY NOT PICK UP ON IT IF THEY'RE JUST LOOKING AT THE CREATININE AND THEY'RE NOT PAYING ATTENTION TO THE BY CAR LEVEL OR TO POTASSIUM OR SODIUM -- THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT SO THAT'S NOW EITHER NOT PAID ATTENTION TO OR NOT UNDERSTOOD AS BEING PROBLEMATIC SO THIS ISN'T AND AND I APPRECIATE THAT WHAT YOUR FOCUS ON HIV IN THAT SORT OF PRIMARY THING BUT THERE COULD BE OTHER CONDITIONS. RIGHT THAT MAY HAVE THAT THAT THAT THERE MAY BE WARNING SIGNS ABOUT. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT NO ONE PAYS ATTENTION TO IT AND THEN FINALLY THE PATIENT COMES AND SAYS -- SOMETHING HAPPENS AND THEY'RE LIKE WELL GEE DOES A TEST DONE BEFORE NO ONE PICKED UP ON IT KNOWN COMMUNICATED TO ME DOORS AN ABNORMALITY. AND TO ME YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT TEAM BASED CARE -- YEAH I THINK THE END THIS IS A PLACE FOR THE PHARMACIST SHOULD HAVE A PRIMARY ROLE BUT THERE SHOULD BE A BACK UP THERE SHOULD BE A PHYSICIAN TEAM PLAYER WHO IS. AVAILABLE TO REVIEW THESE TESTS TO ALSO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE PHARMACIST MIGHT HAVE BECAUSE THESE AREN'T EVEN ADVANCED PRACTICE PHARMACISTS WERE TALKING ABOUT THESE ARE GONNA BE FRONTLINE PHARMACISTS TO YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE TO DO A LITTLE AYE STRAINING. AS  MATTER AS THE PHARMACY BOARD IS REQUIRED BUT THEY DON'T YOU KNOW THAT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO THINK MORE ABOUT THESE TEAMS NOW I KNOW THAT THE THE PROPONENTS ARE GONNA SAY WELL IT'S HARD TO GET A COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE AGREEMENT NIGHT. FIRST OF ALL I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE EVEN SAY THAT A PHYSICIAN CAN ONLY HAVE A CLASS PRACTICE AGREEMENT ONLY ONE PHARMACISTS AND IN FACT YOU HAVE POSITIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND I SAID WELL. DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A CLEVER PRACTICE AGREEMENT WITH THE AN OFF TWENTY THIRTY FORTY PHARMACIES WHO ARE DOING THIS AND THE AND IT BE AVAILABLE AS THAT BACK UP PERSON TO THAT COUNCIL PERSON TODAY WOULD HAVE AN EXISTING RELATIONSHIP WITH. I DON'T YOU KNOW I'M NOT LOOKING FOR LIKE THIS WHOLE BIG BLOWN THING BUT THAT -- THAT'S GONNA BE OVERLY BURDENSOME BUT I DO THINK WE DO NEED TO HAVE THAT. THAT RELATIONSHIP AND THAT BACK UP AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING WHERE PHARMACISTS AS WELL I'M NOT SURE THIS IS RIGHT NOW I GOT A CALL AROUND A BUNCH OF DOCTORS A FIND OF SOMEONE WILL HELP ME IT'S TO BE A PRE EXISTING RELATIONSHIP. SOME HOPING THAT WE CAN TRY I MEAN THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO SEE WE GET TO SOME PLACE LIKE THAT WHERE WHERE WE WERE THERE'S A TEAM THAT CAN WORK TOGETHER TO BE SURE WE HAVE ALL THE BASES COVERED. BECAUSE I DO ONE AND I I'VE BEEN FULLY SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT SOMEONE COMES TO THE PHARMACIST AND THEY GET THE MEDICATION THEY GET THE PATH TO GET TO PRESS RIGHT -- I KNOW THE CMA'S ALSO EXCITED ABOUT THE PREP SIDE OF THINGS I'M FINE WITH THAT BUT I DO FEEL THAT BECAUSE OF THESE ISSUES AND THIS IS. WHAT'S RECOGNIZE CC THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF CLOSING OF THE LOOP. OTHERWISE I'M AFRAID THAT WHILE THERE'S OPPORTUNITY UNFORTUNATELY FOR A PATIENT -- TO TO HAVE SOMETHING YOU KNOW NOT SO POSITIVE HAPPEN IN THE NOT THE SO BE ABOUT THEIR HIV STATUS COULD BE ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. AND SET AND SO I'M YOU KNOW I'M I LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE ABOUT THEIR OVERALL HEALTH BECAUSE I MEAN THIS IS. BECOMING IN FOR THIS BUT AT SOME POINT AND THE PHARMACIST CAN CERTAINLY DO A LOT OF WORK WITH THE KNIVES AND NOT DOWN. BUT IT IS ABOUT BEING SURE THAT WE GET ALL OUR BASES COVERED AND SO THAT THAT THAT IS A CONCERN I SUBMIT THAT I HAVE AND I APPRECIATE BY WAY OF HAVE TO MENTION THAT. I KNOW WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN DIALOGUING BACK AND FORTH AND WE KIND OF INCHING CLOSER TOGETHER WE HAVEN'T QUITE CLOSE THE GAP YET THERE -- BUT AND I REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW YOUR CONCERN IS THAT CLAD PRACTICE ROOM ISN'T THAT TOO MUCH OF A BARRIER I I ACTUALLY. THINK THAT WE CAN THAT THAT THAT'S NOT TOO MUCH OF A BARRIER -- AND THAT IF YOU KNOW WE IF WE CAN'T BUT IF WE CAN'T GET A POSITION TO STEP UP AND SAY I'M WILLING TO DO THIS AND IT'S BECAUSE IT'S TOO RISKY OR THE LIABILITIES TOO HIGH. THEN WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THE PHARMACIST. IF THEY DON'T HAVE THAT BACK UP WITH AS A PHARMACIST ONLY RESPONSE WILL DO IN ORDER TO TEST THEIR THE ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RESULTS. SO I JUST I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT SO. ANYWAY. SELECT FREE AND I KNOW THERE'S SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN MIND BUT NO I I I I APPRECIATE THAT -- MISTER CHAIRMAN AND AND I KNOW YOU -- YOU KNOW -- A AND YOU KNOW THAT I HAVE ENORMOUS RESPECT FOR YOU AS A HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND YOUR YOUR AGREE ON MANY MANY MANY ISSUES AND YOU AND I RARELY DISAGREE -- BUT ON THE SPECIFIC ISSUE AYE AYE WE DID GIVE A REAL CONSIDERATION LOOKED AT AT AND WE AND I AND AS I COMMUNICATED TO AYE ON PORTS I CAN'T ACCEPT -- THAT AMENDMENT -- BECAUSE REQUIRING TO BASICALLY WHAT THAT MAN WOULD DO IS TO SAY OKAY THE ONLY PHARMACISTS THAT CAN PROVIDE -- PROPER PAP ARE PHARMACISTS WHO HAVE A COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE AGREEMENT WITH POSITIONS. AND WHAT THAT AS WELL CALL CPA -- FOR SURE -- A CPA IS A FORMAL FORMAL LEGAL ARRANGEMENT -- THAT WE TOOK WHEN THE ONE PHARMACIST WERE AUTHORIZED -- TO PROVIDE VACCINES IN THE NINETIES FIVE OF A COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE AGREEMENT WAS REQUIRED. AND THAT WAS REPEALED THE LEGISLATURE REPEALED THAT REQUIREMENT BECAUSE IT WAS -- TO ONEROUS AND THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH PHARMACISTS WHO WERE WILLING TO DO IT SO FOR AND AND I'VE ALSO BEEN TOLD THAT THERE ARE AREN'T A LOT OF DOCTORS. WHO WANT TO DO IT BECAUSE THEN? THE DOCTORS HAVING TO WORK THROUGH SOMEONE ELSE. TOWARDS THE PATIENT. AND SO YOU YOU'RE GOING TO END UP WITH VERY FEW PHARMACIES THAT PARTICIPATE I'M AFRAID -- AND IT WILL NOT AND AND THAT'S WHY I BELIEVE IT WOULD REALLY DRAMATICALLY UNDERMINE -- THE BILL AND THAT'S AND FOR THAT REASON I WASN'T ABLE -- TO TO ACCEPT THAT OKAY WELL I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT I'M REALLY LOOKING AT BECAUSE AND UNLIKE. GIVING OF VACCINATION -- AND WE TALKED A LOT OF ACCIDENTS A READY -- THIS IS A THIS REQUIRES IT'S NOT ONLY DISPENSING THE MEDICATION -- IT'S ALSO WEARING LAP THAT LAB TESTS AND ACTUALLY NOT IN THIS. THE NOT NECESSARILY LAB TESTS THAT MAYBE THAT EASILY INTERPRETED AS SOMEONE WHO HAS A POSITION AS TO GET SO YOU ONE COULD ARGUE THAT THEY SAID WELL ALL YOU REALLY NEED TO DO IS GET TO CREATE NAME BUT FLOW AT SAM'S THE ORDER ENTRY AND YOU KNOW BE ON TRAINING. IN THE GUINEA TENSED CAM SEVEN NOW YOU HAVE A SET A LAPSE RESULTS THAT HAVE TO GET INTERPRETED IN. I THINK THAT -- IT AND DECIDE WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE PATIENTS AND SO I THINK THAT THAT I I DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE'RE NOT REALLY CLOSING THE LOOP AND IS THAT I'M. WILLING TO LOOK AT AND I KNOW THAT YOU'D AGAIN I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING SOME BACK FORTH YOU KNOW. THE NATURE OF THE AGREEMENT IN THIS IS YOU CAN BE CONSTRUCTED IN A WAY THAT -- THAT ACTUALLY -- FACILITATES -- THIS HAPPENING WHICH DOESN'T CUT OUT HUGE BURDEN ON THE PHYSICIANS AND AS WELL AS ON THE PHARMACISTS AND SO. SO -- AND THEY DID IT SO ANYWAY I I THINK THAT BUT HAVING SOME PRE EXISTING RELATIONSHIP NOT JUST SIMPLY A LIST OF PHYSICIANS WHO DON'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PHARMACIST I MEAN I THINK THERE HAS TO BE RELATION BETWEEN PHARMACISTS AND DOCTORS SOMEWAY HOUSE. HOWEVER WE WANT TO MANAGE THAT BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME EXPECTATION -- STATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO SO THAT THE POSITION ISN'T BY FROM THE PHARMACIST CALLS TO YOU LIKE BUT WHAT WHEN EIGHT WHERE YOU CALLING ME. RIGHT I DON'T KNOW I KNOW YOU'RE CALLING NEEDS AND FOR WHAT PARTICULAR REASONS BECAUSE I KNOW WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE AGREED IN SOME WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS KIND OF RELATIONSHIP. DOCTOR GRAHAM WHO. MAY BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON THAT AS WELL. YEAH THE THE CBC CALLS -- FOR CREATE IN TESTING AND THE INTERPRETATION OF THAT PARTICULAR TEST ACCORDING TO CDC GUIDANCE IS VERY. SIMPLE IT'S EITHER -- ESTIMATED CRANDON CLEARANCE OF GREATER THAN SIXTY ARE LESS THAN SIXTY I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD. BE -- PRETENDING ARE CLAIMING OR ASKING PEOPLE TO BELIEVE THAT IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT REALLY IS I WOULD ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THESE -- THIS BILL IS ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH CDC GUIDANCE REGARDING HOW TO PROVIDE PROP -- THEY SPECIFICALLY DID NOT REQUIRE THAT A PHYSICIAN BE INVOLVED BECAUSE IT'S REALLY. TOO EASY FOR PHYSICIANS -- ITS IT'S ALGORITHMIC CARE OF LIKE MOUNT MOST OF OUR PREVENTIVE CARE STRATEGIESAND SO WE AND AND YOU KNOW PHYSICIANS ARE NOT GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN ESTABLISHING. A COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE SCREAMS BECAUSE THERE REALLY ISN'T -- AN OF WORK FOR THEM TO DO THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY THEIR EFFORT AND TIME -- IN THOSE AGREEMENTS AND LEGALLY THEY'RE JUST TAKING A LONG TIME TO ESTABLISH. I SHOULD PERHAPS THE OTHER POSITION I MEAN WHEN DO YOU GET A LAB TEST YOU SIMPLY SAY -- I HI THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO BUT I'M JUST -- I GET A LAB TEST AND I TALKED TO THE PATIENT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WANT THE MEDICATION AND WHY THEY'RE NOT AND IT'S JUST FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAYBE NOT PRACTICING THIS EVERY DAY. POST EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS IS AN URGENT SITUATION PRE EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS IS THE LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PHYSICIAN TO DECREASE THAT PERSON'S RISK OF ACQUIRING. HIV INFECTION AND IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY THESE PEOPLE CAME BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE RISK FACTORS THEY WANTED TO REVEAL IT TO PHYSICIAN SEEK HELP FOR IT. IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT OTHER RISKS OF OTHER INFECTIONS OTHER. HEALTH ADVERSE CONDITIONS AT THE ODD AT AND DISCOVER IT AND ADDRESS IT. AND IS THAT IT'S A IT'S A TAKE SOME TIME FOR PEOPLE TO ACT TO AGREE TO COME TO THE DOCTOR WITH THIS CONCERN TO ACCEPT TREATMENT. I IT I DO NOT KNOW IF IT'S GONNA BE EASIER FOR THEM TO REVIEW SUCH INTIMATE. DETAILS OF THEIR LIFE TO A PHARMACIST RETAIL PHARMACY SITUATION SO WE TALK ABOUT OTHERS FACTOR FOR FOR STDS DRUG ABUSE PROBLEMS THIS THING SET UP WITH THE METRIC OKAY ED PREACHY TED BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT. THE BECAUSE YOU'RE JUST LOOKING VERY NARROWLY ABOUT THIS ONE THING AND I'M TO THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU HAVE A TEST RESULT YOU LOOK MORE BROADLY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T JUST SIMPLY SAY WELL. I'D ONLY LOOKED AT THIS ONE ASPECT AND SOMETHING ELSE IS ABNORMAL AND THEREFORE SO I DON'T PAY ATTENTION BECAUSE THIS IS ONLY FOR TESTING FOR PRESS. RIGHT. AND TIMES WHEN THE POTASSIUM IS IT'LL BE LOW OR THE BY COVERAGE EIGHT REPEATED AGAIN TO MAKE SURE OF IT TRANSIT OF REGRET OKAY. CENTER STONE DR GRANT. SO -- IF IF THE PATIENT -- GETS ON ON PROP. WE ORDER THE BLOOD TESTS AND CONNECTING DOCTOR PAN BRING SOME SOME. GOOD POINTS THAT YOU KNOW YOU JUST CAN'T LOOK AT CREE AND THEN YOU CAN JUST LOOK ABILITY -- NITROGEN YOU GOT A LOOK AT SOME OTHER THINGS AS WELL AND WE EAT AND USUALLY WHEN YOU GET THESE TESTS BACK USUALLY SEE THEM HIGHLIGHTED IF THERE'S SOMETHING ABNORMAL USUALLY. RIGHT AWAY. BUT WITHIN THAT THIRTY DAY PERIOD. IF SOMEBODY WAS HAVING REAL DIFFICULTIES. WITH A BE A SYMPTOMATIC OR THEY BE SYMPTOMATIC. IN YOUR IN YOUR VIEWPOINT. WELL THE THE RENAL INSUFFICIENCY WOULD START OFF IN IN A SYMPTOMATIC PHASE. IT WITH -- TEN OFF OF YOUR WE HAVEN'T SEEN RENAL FAILURE WE'VE SEEN ABNORMALITIES IN SERUM CREATININE. A TYPICALLY THEY OCCUR THREE TO FOUR MONTHS AFTER PREP IS STARTED. IT'S NOT N THE FIRST MONTH SO -- AND SO THE PERSON WOULD HAVE TRANSFERRED THEIR CARE -- TO A POSITION BY THAT TIME ACCORDING TO THIS BILL OR THEY WOULD HAVE STOPPED BRIGHT BECAUSE WHEN I'M TRYING TO MAKE IS NOT GONNA GO INTO RENAL FAILURE WITHIN THE FIRST THIRTY DAYS OF TREATMENT -- BASED ON THE LITERATURE THAT YOU ARTICULATED EARLIER THAT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT NEVER SEEN RENAL FAILURE AND IN THE SETTING OF HIV TREATMENT WE CAN SEE BEING A FAILURE AND TYPICALLY CARS THREE OR FOUR MONTHS INTO THERAPY. THANK YOU AND THEN -- SENATOR TO ROSS WE ASK SOME VERY GOOD QUESTIONS ABOUT THOUGH YOU KNOW ARE WE MISSING SOMETHING WHAT CAN HAPPEN AND AND AND YOU KNOW THUS FAR SIDE EFFECTS OF THESE MEDICATIONS. THERE'S AN OVER THE COUNTER DRUGS. THAT ACCOUNTS. FOR MORE POISON CONTROL CENTERS GETTING CALLS THAN ANY OTHER. THAT SAME DRUGS. IS RESPONSIBLE FOR FIFTY SIX THOUSAND EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS TWENTY SIX HUNDRED HOSPITALIZATIONS. AND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT DEATHS DUE TO ACUTE LIVER FAILURE. DO NOT THAT DRUG IS. DOES ANYBODY KNOW TETRICUS. EVEN TIENEN ALL RIGHT SO. TYLENOL IS MUCH MORE -- DANGEROUS. BY FAR. THAN CAPT [inaudible] FOR PRESS. HOWEVER IF ONE DOESN'T GET PREP. OR GET PAP IN A TIMELY WAY. THEN THERE IN JEOPARDY OF HAVING A LIFE THREATENING INFECTION IF THEY DON'T GET. THE PROPER -- MEDICAL CARE THAT THE THEY NEED A AND DESERVE. AND SO -- THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO ALSO MENTION I KNOW IT'S GETTING LATE -- IS IT. THE RURAL AREAS I REPRESENT A LOT OF RURAL AREAS OKAY AND YOU MAY NOT HAVE A DISEASE. WITH A SPECIALIST -- OUT THERE THAT IS. EVEN KNOWS WHAT. PREPPER PET THIS. OUT IN IN VALLEY CENTER ARMED LIFE I GO ALL THE WAY TO THE ARIZONA BORDER. YET WE HAVE PHARMACIES THERE ONLY A PHARMACY PROFESSIONALS THAT WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THIS CONTINUED EDUCATION THAT CAN. INTERVENE IF YOU WELL AND AND REFER THEM TO A LIST OF POSITIONS AND HAVE TO DRIVE AN HOUR AND A HALF IN TWO WEEKS AFTER YOU GET THERE BUT TESTING GO -- BUT THIS HAS. I THINK IT'S GREAT. BENEFITS FROM CHICO ALL THE WAY TO CALEXICO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND FOR THAT REASON I WANT TO MOVE YOUR BILL AND I HOPE THAT WE GET A UNANIMOUS VOTE CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU AND I KNOW IT'S LATE AND I DO APOLOGIZE AND I THINK THEY KEEP TURNING DOWN THE AIR TO MAKE US LOOK LIKE IT'S YOU KNOW AND GET THE LIGHTS UP SO YOU THINK IT'S THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. BUT I I DO HAVE A QUESTION SO IF IF THE LAB WORK IS IS PRESENTED IN THERE ARE THESE ISSUES THAT DOCTOR PAN ADDRESS LIKE THESE OTHER ISSUES -- WHO GETS THE LAB WORK THE PHARMACIST OR THE PHYSICIAN? THE PHARMACIST WILL GET THE LAB WORK. WHO WANTS IF IF -- IF LAB WORK COMES BACK AND IT'S DETERMINED -- THAT. THERE'S SOME ABNORMALITY -- FOR PATIENT PROTECTION. INDIVIDUAL'S RESPONSIBILITY TO GO SEE A PHYSICIAN OR DOES THE PHARMACIST SEND A REFERRAL TO A PHYSICIAN SO THAT THEY CAN? GET TREATED HER THE PHYSICIAN WILL ASK THE PERSON DO YOU HAVE A PRIMARY CAREPROVIDER IF THE PERSON SAYS YES OR NO SORRY. WITHIN THIRTY YOU NEED TO GO TO THE BLOOD WORK YOU NEED TO GO SEE YOUR PHYSICIAN -- BECAUSE AFTER THIRTY DAYS YOU CAN'T CONTINUE UNLESS YOUR PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBED. IF THE PERSON DOES NOT HAVE A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN THE THE PHARMACISTS WERE VITAL LIST. OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS IN THE AREA THE PERSON CONTACT AND THAT IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THAT PERSON. TO CALL AND MAKE AN APPOINTMENT AND TO GET ON TO THE NORMAL OUR REGIMENT. DOES THAT MEAN IS THAT A SATISFYING IN I MEAN I'M JUST ASKING CMA OF THAT IF THAT IS AN ANSWER. I MEAN I GUESS MY ISSUE IS IS THAT. IF IT'S A IMMEDIATE MEDICATION THAT NEEDS TO BE. YOU KNOW DISPENSED IN ORDER TO PREVENT OR SAVE SOMEONE'S LIFE. AND MAKING IT AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE IS A REASONABLE REQUEST. I WOULD THINK. I THINK MOST THE DICING SEVERAL AND SPEAK FOR THEM. YEAH AND THROUGH THE BUT I DO HAVE A A REALLY BIG CONCERN THAT AND I AGREE I THINK PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY SHOULD BE PART OF ALMOST EVERYTHING WE DO IN THIS BUILDING BUT I GUESS YOU KNOW WE DON'T DO IT MUCH OTHER CASES SO. I GUESS HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU WE DON'T TAG PEOPLE LIKE THE SENATOR SAID SO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO FOLLOW UP WITH A PHYSICIAN THAT'S MY HUGE CONCERN. YEAH SO -- ACTUALLY SEE MY WOULD AGREE THAT IN THE EMERGENCY SITUATION WHICH IS THE IN THE PAP SITUATION -- THERE SHOULD BE ACCESS AND WE HAVE PROVIDED LANGUAGE AND PROVIDED -- AMENDMENTS TO TRY TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR I TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES RELATED TO THE EMERGENCY NEED FOR PAP. PREP HOWEVER IS NOT AN EMERGENCY NEED IT'S A PRE EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TIME TO SEE A PHYSICIAN AND TALK TO THE PHYSICIAN ABOUT YOUR CARE AND TREATMENT -- I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S BEEN LEFT OUT IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THE PHYSICIAN WILL INCLUDE IN THAT -- ANALYSIS ON THAT YOUR CARE AND TREATMENT IS GOING TO BE A FULL PANEL OF STD TESTS AS WELL SO IT'S HIV BUT IT'S ALSO ADDITIONAL -- ADDITIONAL TESTS TO LOOK AT OTHER HEALTH FACTORS AS WELL SO THAT'S THAT WOULDN'T BE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL SO AGAIN ON THE ON THE EMERGENCY TYPE SITUATIONS WITH PEP MEDICATION WHERE YOU HAVE TO TAKE WITHIN THREE DAYS. WE FULLY AGREE THAT THERE SHOULD BE ACCESS TO THAT MEDICATION AT A PHARMACY AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE. CERTAIN PROTECTIONS IN PLACE BUT THAT THERE SHOULD BE ACCESS TO THOSE MEDICATIONS THAT FORMS. SIR WE ARE DO YOU SEE THAT IS ACCURATE LIKE THE PEP IS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE EMERGENCY. FULLY ACCESS PHARMACIST COULD ISSUE. BUT ON THE PREP THEY HAVE TIME TO PREPARE IS THERE I DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT IT SO IT IS THEIR TIME. TO PREPARE AND WORK WITH A PHYSICIAN SO COUPLE THINGS CAME A PERSONAL TERMS OF THE CMA DID MAKE BAY THERE OFFER WAS TO STRIP PROP OUT OF THE BILL. AND TO LIMIT THE PHARMACIST PROVIDING PAP TO SEVEN DAYS NOT THE FULL TWENTY EIGHT DAYS. AND AND I MEANS SO YOU WHEN YOU ON THE PATH AFTER AN EXPOSURE YOU NEED TO STAY ON FOR TWENTY THREE DAYS I GET THE ANSWER TO SO THEY ARE THAT IT IS NOT OFFERED TO GIVE THE FOR THE FULL TWENTY DAYS JUST TO BE CLEAR. BUT TO YEAH IT PROP IS NOT AN EMERGENCY IN THE SAME WAY THAT -- THAT HAPPENS BUT WHEN SOMEONE SAYS I THINK I'M AT RISK FOR WHATEVER REASON. AND IT COULD BE THAT THEY BECAUSE OF JUST BEAR THE LIFE OF THEIR LIVING IT COULD BE BECAUSE THE SEXUALLY OR BECAUSE OF INTRAVENOUS DRUG USE IT COULD BE BECAUSE PARTNER. HAS -- IT HAS HIV AND THEY WANT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. IT'S NOT AN EMERGENCY IN THE SEMI PEPPERS BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY TIME SENSITIVE AND WE HAVE SEEN SITUATIONS WHERE PEOPLE HAVE THE LADIES. AND GETTING ON CRAP AND THEY BECOME POSITIVE IN THE INTERIM AND SO YES IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE NOT TO HAVE LONG -- DELAYS AND YES YOU YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE ANY AN STD TEST -- BUT BUT IT IS NOT THE CASE THAT HAVING AN S. T. D.. MEANS THAT IT'S SOMEHOW DANGEROUS TO BE ON PROP -- WE WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE STI TESTS AND KNOW IF THEY HAVE SYPHILIS OR CHLAMYDIA O GONORRHEA BUT THAT THAT IS NOT A BARRIER TO TAKING. PROP THAT JUST MEANS WE WANT TO GET YOU ON THE TREATMENT FOR THOSE INFECTIONS. AND YOU SEEM TO BE SHAKING YOUR HEAD YEAH IF I COULD JUST TO CORRECT THE RECORD SEE MAY DID PROVIDE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD HAVE PROVIDED FOR A FULL TWENTY EIGHT DAY COURSE OF PAT MEDICATION IT EVEN REMOVED AT THE EXISTING RESTRICTIONS OF THE BILL THAT SAY THAT A PATIENT. CAN ONLY RECEIVE PAP TWICE A YEAR WE ACTUALLY STRUCK BACK SEEING THE CONSEQUENCE OF A PATIENT WHO IS EXPOSED TO A THIRD TIME AND WOULD BE UNDER THIS BILL TURNED AWAY FROM A PHARMACY. TO RECEIVE UP EDUCATION WE FELT THAT WASA BARRIER AND WE SHOULD REMOVE IT WE DID PROVIDE LANGUAGE FOR FULL TWENTY EIGHT DAY ACCESS OF THAT MEDICATION WITHOUT THE BARRIER OF THE TWO DAYS SO WELL WE DID AND ARE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS STRIKE THE PROPER MEDICATION. WE DID SEE A A VALUE TO MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO THE PET MEDICATION AT DOESN'T CURRENTLY EXISTIN THE BILL AND IF I COULD JUST CORRECT THE RECORD ON ONE OTHER THING -- EARLIER IT WAS MENTIONED THAT CMA WAS OPPOSED TO CERTAIN BILLS ON EXPANDED ACCESS. TO CONTRACEPTIVES AND VACCINES IN THESE LIKE THAT. IT SHOULD BE MADE CLEAR THAT -- THESE BILLS WERE ALL NEGOTIATED AT THE TIME. THAT THEY WERE PASSING THE LEGISLATURE AND THEY IT WERE NEGOTIATED WITH PATIENT SAFETY PROTECTIONS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS BILL -- SO WE JUST WANT TO CORRECT THAT RECORD ENSURE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING IN THE SENSE THAT WE ARE WILLING TO COME TO THE TABLE AND NEGOTIATE A SAFE. MEANINGFUL ACCESS BILL -- DODGES HASN'T BEEN ACHIEVED AND AGAIN WE HAVE PROVIDED AMENDMENTS TO TO GO THE FULL TWENTY EIGHT DAYS UP HAVE MEDICATION SO. AND IN ADDITION. TO TAKE AWAY SOME OF THE TIES THAT OCCUR IN THE CURRENT LANGUAGE TO THE CDC GUIDELINES WHICH CHANGECONSISTENTLY THEY'RE ALSO TIES IN THIS BILL THAT ONLY ALLOW FORMS IS TO PROVIDE. THE MEDICATION TO PROVIDE A SUIT TO TO SENATOR STONE'S POINT ABOUT ADDITIONAL MEDICATIONS GOING THROUGH THE FTA CURRENTLY. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THOSE MEDICATIONS TO BE PROVIDED AT A PHARMACY WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND WE HAVE TO ADD THAT TO THE STATUE BECAUSE THE STATUTE IS SO IS NEARLY DROPPED IT TO ONLY ALLOW THAT MEDICATION OF PROVIDED TO BE PROVIDED -- THAT PAT AND THE PARAMEDIC PRESS THE MEDICATION IT ALSO TIED CLOSELY TO THE CDC GUIDELINES TO THE EXACT REPORT OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT JUST CAME OUT. WHICH WHICH COULD BE CHANGED AT ANY MOMENT AND SO TAKING OUT THOSE TIES THAT WE THINK IS A BETTER -- WAY OF ADDRESSING A MEANINGFUL ACCESS ON THE PAP SIDE -- AND ON THE PREP SIDE. JUST ON THEIR WE JUST ON THERE AND SO E HAVE ASSET THAT LANGUAGE BE TAKEN OUT AND THAT WE EXPAND SOME OF THE STRUCTURES THAT ARE IN THE CURRENT LAW. OR IN THE CURRENT BILL TO ALLOW FOR MEANINGFUL ACCESS ON PAT SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND THAT SEEM IS NOT OPPOSED TO THE PEP SIDE BECAUSE THEY NEEDED IMMEDIATELY AND WE DON'T WANT TO DENY PEOPLE ACCESS TO SAID ESPECIALLY. IF WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE TRY TO SAVE THEIR LIVES BUT ON THE PREP SIDE THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO IN AND AND TALK TO A PHYSICIAN. ABOUT THE THE THE RISKS THAT THEY FEEL THAT THEIR AND AS A PERSON AND THEN THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED -- BY MEDICAL PROVIDER RATE AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO NEGOTIATE YEAH. ARE YOU UNDER THE SAME AS OURS OKAY SORRY. MY APOLOGIES THAT IS THAT IS BRAND NEW THEY DID -- I GUESS TAKE THAT POSITION WE APPRECIATE THAT MOVEMENT -- THEY WERE FOR A LONG TIME SAYING SEVEN DAYS AND SEVEN DAYS ONLY AND THAT'S THE POSITION A TOKEN BMP WHY NOT BE IMPEDED KRAUT THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE PROVISIONS -- BUT THE THE TO THE STILL ASKING THE PROPERTY REMOVED FROM THE BILL ENTIRELY SO THAT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. THANK YOU. CENTER TOGGLE. A SIMILAR WINNER JUST JUMP WANT TO SAY THAT I I EVE SHARE THE CONCERNS THAT OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ADDRESSED TODAY -- BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I AM REALLY AN EXTREMELY CONCERNEDABOUT. A SOME OF THE NUMBERS THAT I'VE SEEN. THE PACIFIC WE IN MY DISTRICT ACROSS THE STATE -- WE HAVE THIRTY TWO TEENS THAT WERE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV IN. TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIRTY TWO THAT'S AN ACCEPTABLE SHOULD BE -- ZERO IN MY DISTRICT FRESNO COUNTY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT PEOPLE WERE DIAGNOSED NEWLY DIAGNOSED WITH HIV. THAT'S MORE THAN SANTA CLARA COUNTY THAT'S JUST ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT AS SACRAMENTO COUNTY. AND HE NOTES THAT'S FOR RURAL CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT WE NEED TO REALLY BE LOOKING OUT WE NEED TO BE REALLY ADDRESSING THAT A TRUSTS SCENE. AND YOU KNOW I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL TO MY ATTENTION AND EDUCATING ME ON THE FACTS WHEN IT COMES TO MY DISTRICT AND BEYOND. AND I MEAN THESE NUMBERS ARE JUST. I I'M JUST A IT'S IT'S AT NEW TO ME IT REALLY IS AND SO IT SAID SOMETHING THAT -- YOU KNOW. MAYBE IT'S NOT PERFECT AND I DON'T KNOW IF IF IT WILL. PREVENT HIV AND IN MY DISTRICT AND BEYOND. BUT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN WITHIN OUR WITHIN OUR POWER TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT WE PREVENT IT AND THAT -- WE HAVE ACCESS IT'S REALLY AN ACCESS ISSUE I THINK AND YOU KNOW JUST GOING TO WHAT -- ARC MY COLLEAGUES CENTER STONE MENTIONED EARLIER AND SO WITH THAT I WANT TO JUST LET YOU KNOW THAT I SUPPORT YOU IN THIS EFFORT.

I DO HAVE A WITNESS WHO'S DRIVING BACK TO SANTA CRUZ THIS EVENING SO. IN THE SPIRIT OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND COURTESY. I THINK YOU. SENATE BILL. FOUR OH SEVEN RECENTLY INSURERS HAVE BEGAN ADDING NON MEDICAL INNOVATIVE BENEFITS TO THE MOST POPULAR MEDIGAP PACKAGE IN AN ATTEMPT TO DISTINGUISH THEIR PRODUCTS FROM OTHERS IN THE MARKET PLACE. WHILE THESE BENEFITS INCLUDING VISION DENTAL AND HEARING. TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL COVERAGE THE INCLUSION OF THESE NON STANDARD BENEFITS INSIDE THIS STANDARD MEDIGAP BENEFIT PACKAGE HINDER THE ABILITY OF CONSUMERS TO MAKE MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS BETWEEN NON MEDICAL BENEFITS. DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY IN VARIATION OFFERED BY INSURERS MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES MUST NOW COMPARE THE DEDUCTIBLES COPAYMENTS ANNUAL LIMITS PREMIUMS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF EACH VISION DENTAL AND HEARING BENEFIT. IN EACH MEDIGAP PACKAGE FROM EACH INSURER. IN ADDITION INSERTING THESE INNOVATIVE BENEFITS INSIDE A MEDIGAP PLAN WILL AFFECT THE OVERALL PREMIUM COSTS FOR COVERAGE AND LEAD TO PREMIUM INCREASES LEADING TO AN INCREASINGLY EXPENSIVE MEDIGAP PLAN. AS COSTS RISE FOR THESE ADDITIONAL ITEMS AND SERVICES. SENATE BILL FOUR OH SEVEN PROHIBITS THE PRACTICE OF EMBEDDING NON MEDICAL INNOVATIVE BENEFITS. INTO THE BODY OF A STANDARD MEDIGAP PLAN WHICH MAINTAINS THE ORIGINAL FEDERAL INTENT OF STANDARDIZED MEDIGAP BENEFIT PLANS TO COVER MEDICARE'S OUT OF POCKET COSTS. THIS BILL SETS CONSUMER FOCUS STANDARDS WHICH WILL PROTECT AND ALLOW SENIORS TO FULLY UNDERSTAND ALL ASPECTS OF AN INNOVATIVE PLAN THEY MAY SEEK TO PURCHASE. MEMBERS ARE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I VOTED THE PROPIONATE SURE THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT BONNIE BURNS SHE'S A POLICY SPECIALIST WITH THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH ADVOCATES. OKAY WELCOME THANK YOU I KNOW IT'S LATE AND I'LL BE BRIEF. BUT I DO WANT TO TELL YOU WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. CALIFORNIA HEALTH ADVOCATES SINCE TO THE HIGH CAPS THE CALIFORNIA -- HEALTH INSURANCE COUNSELING AND ADVOCACY PROGRAMS -- THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED TO AN INCREASED USE OF THEIR SERVICES BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE POLICIES. I SERVED ON THE TEAM THAT STANDARDIZE THESE POLICIES IN NINETEEN NINETY HAS ORDERED BY. FEDERAL LEGISLATION. I SERVED AS AN EXPERT WITNESS. IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF SANTA CRUZ COUNTY AGAINST A LARGE BAY AREA INSURANCE BROKERAGE. FIRM MASSIVE SALES AND MARKETING ABUSES THAT WORK FOR SYSTEM DURING THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. THIS LAWSUIT AND OTHERS AROUND THE COUNTRY LED CONGRESS TO STANDARDIZE THESE POLICIES IN. NINETEEN NINETY ALMOST THIRTY YEARS AGO. WITH THE STANDARDIZATION OF THOSE POLICIES SALES AND MARKETING ABUSES ALMOST DISAPPEARED. BECAUSE SENIORS COULD EASILY TELL WHAT THE BENEFITS WERE IN THOSE POLICIES. AND COULD CHOOSE THE ADEQUATE COVERAGE THAT THEY WERE LOOKING. FOR EMBEDDING NON STANDARDIZED NON MEDICAL BENEFITS INSIDE A STANDARDIZED MEDIGAP POLICY MAKES IT A LOT MORE DIFFICULT FOR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TO CHOOSE APPROPRIATE COVERAGE. AND THEY CAN'T ADEQUATELY COMPARE THESE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS. TO THOSE BENEFITS OFFERED BY OTHER COMPANIES. SO IT'S OF IS A HARD CHOICE FOR PEOPLE TO MAY. WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR COMPANIES TO COMPETE WITH ONE ANOTHER AND THE NEED TO COMPETE WITH MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PLANS AND WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THESE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS THAT ARE BEING OFFERED IN THESE MEDIGAP POLICIES. BUT THESE BENEFITS ARE NOT STANDARDIZED AND THEY APPEAR TO BE STANDARDIZED BECAUSE THEY'RE INCLUDED IN. A PRODUCT THAT DOES HAVE STANDARDIZED THE BENEFITS. WE KNOW WHAT WOULD BE EASIER FOR CONSUMERS TO COMPARE AND UNDERSTAND THESE BENEFITS IN THE FORM OF A WRITER. WITH SOME DEGREE OF STANDARDIZED FORMAT AND TERMS AND CONDITIONS. WITHOUT AFFECTING THE DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR MEDICAL BENEFITS. AT LEAST ONE COMPANY OFFERING THESE BENEFITS INSIDE A MEDIGAP PLAN ALSO SELLS FOR SEPARATE WRITERS. WITH THE SAME BENEFITS HAVE VARYING PREMIUMS COVERAGE LIMITS AND COPAYMENTS. WE URGE YOU TO HELP US MAINTAIN THE STANDARDIZATION OF MEDICARE BENEFITS THAT HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS. AND HELP SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. TO SELECT THE MOST APPROPRIATE COVERAGE AT THE MOST APPROPRIATE COST FOR THEIR MEDICAL NEEDS. WE URGE YOU. TO VOTE ON THIS BILL AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SEE NINE WITNESSES OPPOSITION OKAY. STEPHANIE WALKEN'S ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WE HAD A PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION WHAT THE AUTHORS OFFICE RECENTLY THIS WEEK WE WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH THEM IN THE SPONSORS TO SEE IF THERE'S A POSSIBILITY FOR US TO COME TOGETHER. WE CERTAINLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CONSUMERS AND SENIORS UNDERSTAND THE PRODUCTS THAT THEIR PURCHASING BUT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE IDEA OF TAKING THESE INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS OFF THE MARKET WE THINK THEY DEFINITELY GIVE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN OPTIONS TO SENIORS AND WE THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. BUT WE WE'D LIKE TO HAVE A OPEN DIALOGUE THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD TODAY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM THANK YOU. JENNIFER ALLY WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION HEALTH PLANS ARE LIKE TO ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUES THANK YOU. OKAY THANKS RIGHT SAY NO OTHER WITNESSES -- ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

SEVEN OKAY THE BILLS OUT SEVEN TWO AND A SAFE DRIVE BACK HOME. ALL RIGHT -- CENTER MORLOCK YOU HAVE. I THINK CENTER ALLEN TRIED TO SNEAK IN BUT YOU ARE HERE FIRST STILL [inaudible] SO. ALL RIGHT THE NEXT ITEM IS ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN SB SIX EIGHTY NINE MISTER MOORE Là WELCOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND A GREAT WEEK I'M GLAD WERE PAID BY THE HOUR. MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES WHEN PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYS DOES SOMETHING THAT SACRAMENTO DISAGREES WITH WHAT IS OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL DO. HE SUES. SOMETHING SIMILAR IS HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA WHEN SACRAMENTO REMOVES LOCAL CONTROL WHAT OF WHAT DO CITIES DO THEY SUE. LAST NOVEMBER THE CITIES OF ORANGE ANAHEIM IN COSTA MESA. IN A SAN DIEGO SUPERIOR COURT ROOM. SUE THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO STOP NONPROFIT CONTRACTORS FROM OPERATING MOBILE. NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS. IN TWENTY ELEVEN AB SIX OH FOUR BY. ASSUMING BEEN ASSEMBLY WOMAN SKINNER. TOOK LOCAL CONTROL AWAY FROM. CALIFORNIA'S MUNICIPALITIES AND GAVE IT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. BUT WHO T THE CITIZENS GO TO WHEN THEY FIND A SYRINGE AND A PUBLIC PARK. WHICH ENDANGERS A CHILD. THERE CITY COUNCIL. BUT THAT CITY COUNCIL HAS ITS HANDS TIED CAN'T DO ANYTHING. SACRAMENTO NOW WANTS TO TAKE AWAY SOME LOCAL CONTROL WHEN IT COMES TO LAND USE DECISIONS. AS A RESULT OF HAVE A HOUSING SHORTAGE PERHAPS IT'S TIME TO REEVALUATE WHAT IS GOING ON SB SIX EIGHTY NINE ATTEMPTS TO DO THIS. SHOULD LOCAL CITIES DETERMINE WHEN AND WHERE NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS OPERATE WITHIN THEIR BORDERS OR IN THE CASE OF ORANGE COUNTY. SHOULD CIVIL SERVANTS FOUR HUNDRED MILES AWAY DECIDE. SB SIX EIGHTY NINE PROVIDES A DECORUM THAT WILL HOPEFULLY. AVOID FURTHER LEGAL COSTS ESPECIALLY WHEN OUR CITIES ARE FINANCIALLY STRAPPED FROM EVER INCREASING PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTION COSTS. THE CITY HAS AN ORDINANCE OR RESOLUTION. PERMITTING A NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM THEN WE'RE GOOD TO GO. IF THE CITY DOES NOT BEEN THE CASE SHOULD BE MADE TO THE MAJORITY OF THE CITY COUNCIL TO DO SO. WE ALL APPRECIATE AS THE JUDGE IN SAN DIEGO SAID THE NOBLE GOAL. BUT THE POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS THE JUDGE PUT SAID. THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE HARM OUTWEIGHS THE SOCIAL UTILITY OF THE PROGRAM. WITH THE RECENT EPIDEMIC OF OPIOID ABUSE. IN SOLVING ONE PROBLEM ANOTHER ONE IS CREATED WHY SHOULD PARKS BE RATE EACH MORNING WHY SHOULD LIBRARY JANITORS FIND THEMSELVES SYRINGE OR A PATRON FINDING A NEEDLE IN A BORROWED BOOK. HAVING LOCAL COOPERATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY PROVIDES FOR A PROPER COLLABORATION. UNILATERALLY IMPOSING A NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM PROVIDES FOR SURPRISE CONFUSION AND ULTIMATELY LITIGATION THIS DOESN'T MAKE GOOD SENSE SB SIX EIGHTY NINE AFFIRMS THE APPROPRIATE ETIQUETTE. IN ADDRESSING IMPORTANT HEALTH ISSUES FACING OUR COMMUNITIES. SO COLLEAGUES I HAVE TWO WONDERFUL WITNESSES THAT HAVE STAYED TELL THE TEN O'CLOCK HOUR. I HAVE THE SERVICE DEAVER'S AND I HAVE THE HEALTH CARE AGENCY DIRECTOR FROM THE COUNTY OF ORANGE RICHARD SANCHEZ. OKAY THANK YOU WITNESSES SUPPORT YOU HAVE A MAXIMUM OF SIX MINUTES BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU ALTHOUGH GIVEN THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR IF YOU COULD BE MORE BRIEF THAT PROBABLY WOULD BE APPRECIATED -- SO FAR -- THAT HAS AS HE MENTIONED THE NEEDLESS TO A MOBILE EXCHANGE PROGRAM WAS APPROVED BY UNILATERALLY BY THE STATE IN ORANGE COUNTY. OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF LOCAL ELECTIVES AND CITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. BY WORKING WITH THE LOCALS WE COULD ADDRESS ISSUES THAT WERE EXPRESSED REGARDING DISPOSAL OF NEEDLES. INCLUDING -- MEDICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT THE SIGHTING OF THE LOCATIONS SYRINGE EXCHANGE RATIOS THE AVAILABLE WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR HIV AND STD -- TESTING. LINKAGES TO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SO THIS WOULD HELP US PARTNER WITH ANY EXCHANGE FORMAT. ONE COMMENT TO ORANGE COUNTY OR ANY COUNTY OR CITY. AND ALSO WORK IN COLLABORATION TO MAKE SUCCESSFUL TO GET HOPEFULLY PEOPLE OFF DRUGS. SO FOR THAT REASON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND IN ORANGE COUNTY. EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. THIRTY RICH FOR THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA CITIES IN ORANGE COUNTY. PLEASE I GOT TO TESTIFY WHILE IT'S STILL BEEN IN DAY. SO WITH THE US CITIES HAVE AN INTEREST IN SOME LOCAL CONTROL IN SUPPORT IN THIS BILL IT AT THE LITIGATIONS FOCUSED ATTENTION ON THINGS LIKE DRUG FREE ZONES SCHOOLS OTHER AREAS WHERE THEY MIGHT HAVE LOCAL KNOWLEDGE AND WANT TO PASS LOCALORDINANCES TO SAY THIS IS WHERE. IS THE PLACE WE OUGHT NOT HAPPEN YOU'D NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS THAT'S REALLY THEIR INTEREST. AND SO FOR THAT REASON THEY'RE ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND BACK MICROPHONE. NAME WORKSTATION POSITION. THE BILL ACTUALLY CAME UP FOR A TEMPER HE MEANT AS A STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I AM I AM A MOM AND I AM A PERSON IN LONG TERM RECOVERY.

SEEN OTHER WITNESSES WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION YOU PLEASE COME UP THANK YOU. OKAY AGAIN A REMINDER -- SIX MINUTES MAX BETWEEN ALL THE SPEAKERS ALTHOUGH AGAIN GIVEN THE LATENESS OF THE HOUR IF YOU CAN BE MORE BRIEF THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED. GOOD EVENING -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK -- MISTER M. DISTINGUISHED FELLOW AT THE NONPROFIT HEALTH. RESEARCH INSTITUTE CALLED RTI INTERNATIONAL AND I'VE BEEN DOING RESEARCH ON DRUG USE A HEARING CALIFORNIA FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS -- AND THAT RESEARCH HAS INCLUDED OVER A HUNDRED SIXTY PAPERS PUBLISHED IN PEER REVIEWED MEDICAL JOURNALS OF WHICH CLOSE TO FORTY OF THEM ON TOPIC OF NEEDLE EXCHANGE PACIFIC LEE -- ALMOST ALL THAT IT HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- WITH VALUE ADDED -- TWENTY THREE AND NEW EXCHANGE PROGRAMS IN THE STATE -- SO WE'VE DONE QUITE A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC. FROM A COUPLE THINGS THE FOR THE FIRST IS WE KNOW THESE ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY -- YOU KNOW THE WITH WITH THE OPIOID CRISIS RIGHT NOW -- THEY ARE QUITE GOOD AT AN ALMOST EVERYONE OF THESE ACTUALLY THINK ALMOST EVERYONE OF THESE PROGRAMS IN THE STATE. IS HANDING OUT AN UNLOCKS OWN HANOI CAM TO TWO PEOPLE TO PREVENT OVERDOSES WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT'S QUITE IMPORTANT -- AND THEN OBVIOUSLY THE HIV AND VIRAL HEPATITIS THE NEW EXCHANGE HAS SHOWN TO WORK. AND SO THE THOSE ARE THOSE ARE JUST VERY VERY IMPORTANT AND NOT REALLY FOR CITY POLITICIANS TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT BUT READ THIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE THAT THE YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH. ON THE OTHER THING IS -- ABOUT THESE NEEDLES THAT THAT THAT THE GERMANS TALKING ABOUT -- WE DID A STUDY THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN THAT -- IN THE JOURNAL CALLED A DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE A FEW YEARS AGO WE ACTUALLY. WENT TO TO CITIES SAN FRANCISCO WHICH HAS A VERY LARGE SCALE NEEDLE EXCHANGE. IN MIAMI FLORIDA WHICH DID NOT HAVE ANY LOOKS CHANGE THE TIME. AND WE DID A VISUAL WALKED BUYS OF THOUSAND RANDOM BLOCKS IN EACH OF THOSE AND IN EACH OF THOSE CITIES. AND WE FOUND WAS EIGHT TIMES MORE SYRINGES ON THE STREETS OF THE OF MIAMI THAN SAN FRANCISCO THAT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY LOW EXTENSION MIAMI. AND SO -- THIS PAPER VERY MUCH CLEARLY SHOWED THAT NEW EXCHANGE PROGRAMS NOT ONLY ARE -- ARE SAVING LIVES THROUGH HIV AND HEPATITIS C. AND AN OVERDOSE BUT THEY'RE ALSO ACTUALLY HELPING THE COMMUNITY THAT BRINGING NEEDLES OFF OF THE STREETS -- AND AND SO FORTH FOR US -- YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING A COMMUNITY CAN JUST DECIDE ON ITS OWN WHETHER THEY SHOULD DO OR NOT TO DO -- BUT RATHER THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S IMPERATIVE FOR US TO DO AT THIS POINT -- AND SO -- I I WOULD URGE OF THE VOTE -- AGAINST THIS AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU A COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS LAURIE THOMAS AND THE DEPUTY STATE DIRECTOR OF THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE WE WERE ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF ASSEMBLY BILL SIX OH FOUR BY -- NOW SENATOR SKINNER BUT THEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER SKINNER THAT CREATED THIS PROCESS ALLOWING THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- TO HELP IDENTIFY AREAS OF HIGH NEED -- THAT WERE UNDERSERVED DIE IN TERMS OF HIV AND HEPATITIS AN OVERDOSE RISK AND SO THAT PROCESS THAT WAS DELINEATED IN ASSEMBLY BILL SIX OH FOUR BY SENATOR SKINNER -- ALLOWS FOR COMMUNITY INPUT ALLOWS FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND IT HELPS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMUNITY IS ENGAGED IN THE CONVERSATIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY'VE BEEN ABLE. TO HELP COMMUNITIES -- ADD THESE SERVICES TO THEIR CONTINUUM OF CARE -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND COUNTY SUCH AS KINGS COUNTY SISKIYOU A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COUNTIES SO -- YOU KNOW THE THE PROCESS -- ALREADY ALLOWS FOR A FAIR AMOUNT OF COMMUNITY. AND FOR THE MORE DENTURES THAT VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS HAVE ACCESS TO THIS AND THAT THAT ACCESS IS NOT LIMITED BASED ON WHERE THEY LIVE THAT THE LONELY -- SEVEN NOT ONLY ABLE TO ACCESS IT IF THEY LIVE IN A LARGE CITY BUT THEY THEY CAN ALSO ACCESS THESE IMPORTANT A PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. IN -- RURAL COMMUNITIES AS WELL -- THERE IS FREQUENTLY SO MUCH STIGMA AROUND ISSUES OF DRUG USE AND POLITICIZATION OF FROM THE WAR ON DRUGS ON DOWN. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT THESE PUBLIC HEALTH DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE BY PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS WITH -- ALL OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH -- EPIDEMIOLOGY AND SURVEILLANCE DATA -- AND COMMUNITY INPUT AS POSSIBLE AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS -- WE WOULD ASK FOR YOU TO VOTE AGAINST THIS EFFORT TO UNDO CENTER SKINNER SPELL THANK YOU.

SO I FIRST WANT TO JUST THINK THE THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR FOR WORKING IMPROVE THIS MEASURE AND I I'M I'M VERY HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE MINUTES. THANK YOU TO SIT IN THE ANALYSIS THAT THIS IS A SIMPLE BUT IMPORTANT MEASURE. BASED ON LIES AND SIX OTHER STATES -- SB. SIX SEVEN SEVEN PROHIBITS THE USE OF NATURAL LATEX GLOVES IN RESTAURANTS AND OTHER FOOD FACILITIES. NOW WHY DID WHY WE HAD TO GET TO THIS PLACE WELL I INCIDENTS OF OF LATEX ALLERGIES ARE INCREASING WITH AN ESTIMATED. AS MANY 6% OF PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES DIAGNOSE THE ALLERGY INCLUDING UP 270% OF HEALTH CARE AND FOOD SERVICE WORKERS AND 711% OF THE ELDERLY -- WORKERS TO USE LATEX GLOVES ARE AT HIGHER RISK FOR DEVELOPING THIS ALLERGY BECAUSE THE MORE PERSON COMES IN THE CONTEXT OF LATEX. THE GREATER THE RISK FOR THOSE SUFFERING FROM THIS ALLERGY EVEN TRACE AMOUNTS OF NATURAL RUBBER LATEX CAN BE DEADLY. I AM ALLERGIC REACTION CAN BE PROVOKED BY TOUCHING A PRODUCT CONTAINING NATURAL RIGHT -- RUBBER LATEX AND HEALING AIRBORNE LATEX PROTEIN PARTICLES OR EATING FOOD PREPARED USING LATEX GLOVES. AND I'LL SAY ACTUALLY OUR FRIEND WHO'S UP HERE FROM -- FROM THE DISTRICT. HAS ALREADY HAD TO HAVE A PEN INJECTIONS TODAY ALONE WE HAD A LOT OF OF MOMS WITH A LOT OF BABY MATERIALS IN. LATEX MATERIALS AND I'LL JUST TELL YOU JUST ILLUSTRATE THE PROBLEM SHE WENT OVER TO CHICORY WHICH USED TO BE LATEX FREE. START BUT IT STILL WAS IN I HAD AN EMERGENCY -- BECAUSE APPARENTLY THEY STARTED USING LATEX AGAIN -- SO SO THERE THE USE THAT THE SYMPTOMS CAN RANGE FROM YOUR HIVES AND RASHES ALL THE WAY TO LIFE THREATENING ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK. NOW. HERE'S THE THING THE I WOULD NOT BE COMING TO THIS BILL IF THERE WASN'T A REASON ALTERNATIVES AND CLEANING CLINICS ARE MEMORIAL OUT ALONG THE TO MORRELL JOHNS HOPKINS HAVE BEEN.

THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF OCCUPATIONAL. SAFETY AND HEALTH RECOMMENDS THAT WORKERS USE NON LATEX GLOVES FOR ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT LIKELY TO INVOLVE CONTACT WITH INFECTED MATERIAL SUCH AS FOOD PREPARATION -- AND WE'RE EXISTING LAW REQUIRES LOVE TO BE USE ALTERNATE SUCH AS NITRILE GLOVES OFFER THE SAME OR BETTER PROTECTION AND ARE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT CHEAPER -- SO SINCE OF INTRODUCING THE ALL OF THE MEASURE WE'VE HAD A MASSIVE OUTPOURING OF PEOPLE CONTACT OUR OFFICE TO SHARE THEIR LATEX THE STORIES.

SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THE BILL IN FRANCE THAT WE ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED. DID SPECIFIED THOSE EXEMPTIONS IT WAS VERY SPECIFIC THE AMENDMENTS WERE TAKING TODAY NARROW THAT AND IT SAYS THAT THE REGULATOR THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE WHO. SPECIALIZES IN PROTECTING CONSUMERS SHOULD COME UP WITH THOSE DETERMINATIONS. TO INITIALLY PUT FORWARD SOME EXEMPTIONS THAT WE OFFERED THERE WAS CONCERNS FROM HEALTH ACCESS OTHER GROUPS SO WE TOOK THAT -- WE'VE SAID THE DEPARTMENT SHE AND SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO THE AMENDMENTS SHOULD ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. GOING ON ALL UP TO PLEASE THANK YOU THREE CHAIR AND NOT I THINK THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN THROUGH THE COMMITTEE. IS UP PROVIDES A GREAT FIRST STEP FOR US TO FURTHER LOOK INTO THE QUESTION AROUND FIRST THE LEVEL OF RISK THAT ANY ENTITY WOULD BE WILLING TO TAKE. BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ENTITIES ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE PROPER HEALTH CARE AND SERVICES TO THE CONSUMER SO THAT THE CONSUMER. WILL NOT BE FINANCIALLY LIABLE SHOULD THAT ENTITY NOT BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THOSE SERVICES AND THEN SECOND -- WITH WHAT THE SPONSORS HAVE MENTIONED WE WOULD HOPE TO ALSO ENGAGE WITH THE IMAGE SEE ON THE GUIDELINES THAT THEY ARE ABOUT TO PROVIDE ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO TO FINALIZE RULED THAT.

ANY OTHER QUESTIONS SEEING NONE I CAN CENTER BURGER APPRECIATE -- YOU BRING THIS BILL FORD AND ALSO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION ONE OF THINGS THAT WE'VE. TALKED ABOUT WITH AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING IS ABOUT KNOWING IT AGREE CARE BUT VALUE BASED PURCHASING. I THINK WE WILL BE SURE WE STRIKE THAT BALANCE -- WHERE WE CERTAINLY WANT TO MAINTAIN PATIENT PROTECTIONS WE DON'T EVER WANT THE PATIENT TO GET STRANDED WHERE THEY WERE IDENTITY THAT'S BRING RISKS NOW SAYS WHY DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY AND I CAN'T PROVIDE THE CARE SERVICES OFFICE PROVIDE YOU WANNA BE SURE THAT? PROTECTION IS IN PLACE -- WE ARE LOOKING AT TO ACTUALLY VALUE BASED ARRANGEMENTS WHICH I THINK THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLANS ALSO LIKE AS WELL BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT TRAINED SAYS.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALL OF THEIR WORK. SB SEVEN FORTY ONE WILL PROTECT TRANSGENDER PEOPLE'S PRIVACY BY UPDATING AND ALIGNING THE PROCESS FOR WHICH MERITS TREATED MARRIAGE CERTIFICATES AND BIRTH CERTIFICATES ARE PROCESSED. CURRENT LAW STILL DISCLOSES THE REGIONAL OR BIRTH NAME ON THESE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS AND THEREFORE ALLOWS FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF DISCRIMINATION OF TRANSGENDER PEOPLE. SB SEVEN FORTY ONE WOULD FIX THIS AND PROTECT. TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS FROM DISCRIMINATION WHEN ROLLING THEIR CHILD AND SCHOOL. APPLYING FOR A LOAN OR SIMPLY WHEN OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS NEED TO BE DISCLOSED WITH ME TODAY IS TAMMY MARTIN WITH THE QUALITY CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA WHO WILL HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY HAVE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU WITNESSES SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS TAMMY MARTIN ONCE AGAIN ON BEHALF OF EQUALITY CALIFORNIA SPONSOR OF SB. SEVEN FORTY ONE AND THE IMPETUS FOR THIS BILL CAME FROM AMIR HAZEN BUSH WHO RUNS A LAW FIRM IN A LOS ANGELES COUNTY THAT FOCUSES ON LGBT Q. INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. AND AMIR WAS UNABLE TO ATTEND TODAY BUT ASKED THAT I SHARE A FEW POINTS WITH THE COMMITTEE REGARDING THE NEED FOR THIS BILL. I'M IN THE LAST YEAR AMIR WORKED WITH A CLIENT WHO ASKED IF SHE COULD MODIFY HER CHILD'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE. TO REFLECT HER HUSBAND'S GENDER HE'D RECENTLY TRANSITION TO MAIL. AND ALL AMERICA TELL HER CLIENT WAS THAT IT WOULD COST MORE MONEY AND SHE COULDN'T GUARANTEE THE OUTCOME. SO THE CLIENT CHOSE NOT TO MAKE THE CHANGE IT ALSO THE FATHER IS STILL LISTED AS THE CHILD'S MOTHER ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE. ANOTHER CLIENT HIRED TO COMPLETE HER NAME AND GENDER CHANGE ABOUT ELEVEN MONTHS AGO. AND AMIRA RECEIVED CONFIRMATION THAT THE CLIENT FINALLY RECEIVED HER AMENDED MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE JUST EARLIER THIS MONTH. IN ORDER TO GET HER CLIENT A NEW MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE WITH THE OLD ONE SEALED AND WITHOUT% INDICATIONS OF HER FORMER NAME. AMEERA DRAFTED IN SUBMITTED A LEGAL MEMO TO THE COURT. HAD A FORMAL HEARING FOR A JUDGE FILED A SEPARATE MOTION GOT THAT ORDER PARTIALLY APPROVED SENT THIRTY EMAILS BACK AND FORTH WITH VITAL RECORDS MAKE COUNTLESS PHONE CALLS AND TOWED A VERY CAREFUL LINE BETWEEN BANKING AND INSISTING. AMIR ULTIMATELY EXCEED SUCCEEDED ON BEHALF OF HER CLIENT BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF TRANSGENDER PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESERVOIRS. TO HIRE PRIVATE COUNSEL AND AMIRA DOES NOT THINK THAT HER CLIENTS OUTCOME COULD HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED WITHOUT THE ADVOCACY OF A LAWYER. AND FRANKLY AMERICA NOTES SHE WASN'T EVEN INITIALLY SURE THAT SHE COULD DO IT AND SHE'S NOT SURE THAT EVERY LAWYER WOULD GET THE SAME OUTCOME. THIS SHOULD NOT BE THE PROCESS THE CHANGES SMALL IN THE FIX IS SIMPLE. CALIFORNIANS OF TRANS EXPERIENCE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR LEGAL NAME AND GENDER REFLECTED ACCURATELY ON ALL OF THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE DOCUMENTS. WE'RE GRATEFUL TO SENATOR GALGIANI FOR HER ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE AND RESPECTFULLY URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT SB SEVEN FORTY ONE AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES SUPPORT SEEN ON WHAT THIS IS IN OPPOSITION SAYING ON QUESTIONS WILL COME ANY MEMBERS. THERE'S A MOTION FROM CENTER DORADO. NOW THAT THAT LEYVA SORRY.

DISTRIBUTOR AUDIBLE CHAIR COLLEAGUES I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB FOUR FOUR SIX WHICH WOULD PROVIDE MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR HYPERTENSION MANAGEMENT. MEDICATION MANAGEMENT SERVICES PROVIDED BY AN ADVANCED PRACTICE PHARMACIST HYPERTENSION CONTROL THE UNITED STATES IS COVERED AT A ROUGHLY 50% OVER THE PAST DECADE DESPITE THE DANGEROUS ROLE HYPERTENSION PLAYS IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. AND THAT THE FIRST FIVE LINES OF MEDICATIONS HARPER ATTENTION ARE GENERIC AND BROTHER AND EXPENSIVE. THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH BENEFITS -- YOU PROGRAM STATED IN THEIR STUDY THAT MOST PREVALENT CONDITION AMONG NON DO A MEDI CAL ENROLLEES IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WAS HYPERTENSION A 27%. THE HOUSE IS ALSO STATED THERE'S A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE FROM FIVE STUDIES AT THE RECEIPT OF COMPREHENSIVE MEDICATION MANAGEMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER REDUCTIONS IN. BLOOD RESSURE THAN THAT OF USUAL CARE THIS INCLUDES ONE STUDY PUBLISHED THIS YEAR IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE DEMONSTRATING THAT PHARMACISTS MANAGING MEDICATIONS IN LOS ANGELES BARBER SHOPS. FOR PATRONS WITH UNCONTROLLED HYPERTENSION ARE NEARLY SIX TIMES MORE EFFECTIVE THAN USUAL CARE ENTERTAINING BUT PRESSURE CONTROL. WITH HYPERTENSION BEING ONE OF THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS TO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN THERE BY THE GREATEST DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE RISK OF DEATH WORLDWIDE NUMBER. ONE SB FOUR FOUR SIX IS NEEDED HELP BRING DOWN BLOOD PRESSURE AND LOWER RATES OF DEADLY CARDIO VASCULAR DISEASE AS BEFORE FOR SIX WILL CREATE MORE ACCESS TO COMMUNITIES ARE CURRENTLY. DON'T HAVE HYPERTENSION MEDICATION MANAGEMENT SERVICES READILY AVAILABLE. ENGAGING PHARMACISTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION IS CRUCIAL TO ACHIEVING GOALS FOR ON CONTROL PATIENTS AS BEFORE FOR SIX IS A REPEAT OF A BILL THAT IRAN LAST YEAR SB. TWELVE SIXTY FOUR WHICH PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY AND WAS HELD ON SUSPENSE UNFORTUNATELY AND THE ASSEMBLY. I WAS -- GOING TO BE INTRODUCING TODAY HAVE BEEN HERE EARLIER A COUPLE OF DOCTORS FROM CEDAR SINAI HOSPITAL BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAD TO CATCH A PLANE TO GO HOME WHICH I DON'T BLAME THEM AT TEN TWENTY BUT I AM HONORED TO HAVE THE SHOW RE WAS HERE FROM THE CALIFORNIA -- PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION WHO WILL BE MY ONE AND ONLY PROBABLY WITNESS -- PLEASE -- I'D LIKE TO DO SPECIAL REQUESTS OKAY THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU CAN MACHAR REBUS WHAT THE CALIFORNIA PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION ACCORDING TO THE CDC APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY FIVE MILLION AMERICANS OLD -- AGE EIGHTEEN AND OVER HAVE HYPERTENSION UNFORTUNATELY ONLY ABOUT HALF OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS THE HYPERTENSION IS CONTROLLED -- ONE OF THE STRATEGIES DEVELOPED BY THE CDC HAS BEEN TO INCREASING GAUGE MIGHT OF NON POSITION TEAM MEMBERS AND HYPERTENSION MANAGEMENT AND INCREASE ENGAGEMENT AT PHARMACIES IN PROVIDING EDUCATION. SKEWS ME MEDICATION MANAGEMENT THERAPY FOR ADULTS WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. UNFORTUNATELY WHILE THIS IS A PROVEN METHOD THIS IS NOT CURRENTLY COVERED UNDER THE MEDICAL SYSTEM WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WILL HELP ADDRESS THAT ISSUE HELP WITH INHERITS AND HELP THESE FOLKS MAINTAIN THEIR HELP THEM WITHOUT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. OKAY THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU MISTER DAVID THEMSELVES AMERICA'S VISION GROUPS HAPPEN TO BE IN SUPPORT WE SUPPORT LAST HIS BILL AND SUPPORT THIS ONE AS WELL THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU A WITNESS IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] THESE COMMA. MEMBERS TO MADDEN REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY -- AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO ASK BEFORE FOR SIX ON WHEN IT COMES TO HYPERTENSION -- PHYSICIANS GO THROUGH A NUMBER STEPS WHEN LOOKING AT ON HOW TO MANAGE IS COMPLEX DISEASE STATE. AND ALL THIS INFORMATION THAT WE COMPILE GOES INTO THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL RECORD ONE OF OUR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL IS THAT THE PHARMACIST MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THAT PATIENT'S MEDICAL RECORD. WHEN IT COMES TO TRYING TO EVALUATE WHAT TO RECOMMEND OR WHAT TO INITIATE IN TERMS OF TREATMENTS THEY WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION -- WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT A PHARMACIST AND THEIR TRAINING AND BACKGROUND. ARE NECESSARILY -- TRAINED EXTENSIVELY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION I THINK IT'S WORTH MENTIONING THE SENATOR STONE'S MENTION THIS BILL IS LIMITED TO ADVANCE PRACTICE FARMER SAYS. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT THAT'S NOT THE CASE IT DOES APPLY TO THE ADVANCED PRACTICE PHARMACISTS. BUT IT ALSO APPLIES TO A REGULAR FARMS AS WELL AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE I THINK WE HEAR MORE OF A CONCERNS AS WITH THE PHARMACIST IT ISN'T HAVE THAT ADVANCED. DEGREE WEATHER THERE ARE TRAINED IN MANAGING HYPERTENSION. WE WORRY THAT THE PHARMACIST WHO MAY NOT HAVE THAT TRAINING WILL INITIATE -- TREATMENTS THAT ARE NECESSARY OR APPROPRIATE AND THAT A LEAD TO INCREASED HEALTHCARE COSTS AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO DO QUITE THE OPPOSITE -- IN FOR THOSE REASONS -- WERE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION SEE NINE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY IS THERE A MOTION ON THE BILL. OKAY AS MOTION BY STERN GROVE AND I I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY. THAT THIS BILL. APPLIES TO PHARMACISTS AND FACILITIES HER WORKING IN FACILITIES WHERE THERE IS ALSO A PHYSICIAN SO THERE'S GOING TO BE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PHARMACIST AND THE PHYSICIAN -- AND THIS IS STILL CORRECT EXACTLY IN THAT WERE WERE OPERATING UNDER THE PROTOCOLS OF THE PHYSICIAN WE'RE NOT HANGER SHINGLE OUT AN INDEPENDENT PHARMACY BECAUSE SAYING COME ONE COME ALL OVER TO TREAT YOUR ATTENTION -- I I WILL RATE THOUGH THAT -- EVEN WITHOUT THIS AGREEMENT PHARMACISTS ARE LEGALLY ALLOWED TO TAKE BLOOD PRESSURES AND LET THE PATIENT KNOW REGULAR HIGH OR LOW AND WE WHAT WE DO REFER THEM TO A PHYSICIAN. THIS IS MORE IN A HEALTH CARE SETTING WERE PHARMACISTS IS WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE POSITION WITH ESTABLISHED PROTOCOLS TO KEEP. KEEP AN EYE ON THESE PATIENTS AND STOP THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH AND NOW IN THE UNITED STATES BUT THE WORLD IN. REDUCING MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY ASSOCIATED HYPERTENSION AND I WANT TO THANK-- SENATOR PAN THE MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THIS BILL I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE THE OPPOSITION ON THIS AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN COME TO A CONSENSUS. AND APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE TONIGHT OKAY SO THAT IT WOULD THAT BE YOUR CLOTHES AND YES OKAY THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOU WORKING WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT BUILDING TO SCHOOL AT THIS OPPORTUNITY -- FOR FOR FOR FIFTEEN DAYS CARE WITH A WITH A WITH A LEADING ROLE FOR THE PHARMACIST THANK YOU. SO WITH THAT. IT'S BEEN MOVED BY CENTER GROVE THE MOTIONS TO PASS APPROPRIATIONS SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. PAN HI AN ICE STONE STONE I'D DORADO. DRUGS -- I GROWTH. GROUP I HEARD TOTO. TOTO AYE LEYVA THEY'VE AYE MITCHELL. HI MITCHELL AYE MONNING MONNING AYE RUBIO. REVIEW BY. NINE BILLS OUT NINE ZERO OKAY -- CENTER STONE YOU -- GO ONCE MORE GIVE YOU THE GAVEL AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER TEN SB FIVE A THREE CONSULTING THANK YOU. STRUCTURE SENATORS SB FIVE OH THREE WOULD PRESENT IT WOULD STRENGTHEN OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY OF MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS WHEN THOSE PLANS SUBCONTRACTS SERVICES AND DELEGATE RESPONSIBILITIES. MEDI CAL NOW PROVIDES HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR OVER THIRTEEN MILLION PEOPLE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PARTICULARS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY PROVIDES CARE 482% OF ALL ENROLLEES. AND WHILE THE PART OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES CONTRACTS WITH MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS THE MANAGED CARE PLANS THEMSELVES ARE PERMITTED TO SUBCONTRACT NOR TO COORDINATE PROVIDE CARE TO ENROLLEES. MANAGED CARE PLANS MAY SUBCONTRACT WITH A NUMBER OF ENTITIES INCLUDING INDEPENDENT PRACTICES ASSOCIATIONS MEDICAL GROUP MANAGEMENT SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS AND EVEN OTHER HEALTH PLANS. AND SOME CASES THE DELEGATED ENTITIES WILL FURTHER SUBCONTRACT THEIR PATIENT CARE AND ADMINISTRATIVE RESPONSIBILITIES I THINK OUR MEMBERS FROM LA PARTICULAR FAMILIAR WITH THAT -- THE LAYERS OF SUBCONTRACTING ARE COMPLEX AND OFTEN LACK APPROPRIATE TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT UNFORTUNATELY RECENT EVENTS ILLUSTRATE THE PATIENT CARE CAN SUFFER BECAUSE OF THIS. A WHISTLE BLOWER COMPLAINT TWENTY SEVENTEEN SHED LIGHT ON THE SUBCULTURE TRACTOR FALSIFYING DOCUMENTS RELATE TO PATIENT THE NILES OF CARE THIS IS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALLEGING A DIFFERENT A DIFFERENT ENTITY WAS PERFORMING UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT INAPPROPRIATELY. SB FIVE OH THREE WILL HELP IMPROVE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY THE BILL WILL STRENGTHEN BEACH CS IS ABILITY TAKE ACTION WHEN THERE ARE REPORTS OF PROBLEMATIC BEHAVIOR BY HEALTH PLANS -- THEIR SUBCONTRACTORS ESTABLISH AUDIT RETIREMENTS INCLUDING REQUIRING MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS TO ANNUALLY AUDIT THEIR SUBCONTRACTORS AND CONDUCTS SURPRISE AUDITS REPEAT REPORT WOULD SUBCONTRACTOR ACTIONS RESULT IN THE BENEFICIARY GRIEVANCE OR PEEL. AND MAKE CLEAR THAT MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SERVICES PROVIDED TO BENEFICIARIES REGARDLESS OF ANY SUBCONTRACTING DELEGATION OR SUB DELEGATION PROTECT CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND SUBCONTRACTING ENTITIES I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. I SUSPECT WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE I WITNESSES AND SUPPORT WELCOME. GOOD EVENING LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY PROUD CO SPONSORS OF THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE TO PROVIDE GREATER OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY OF MEDI CAL PLANS THE DELEGATE RESPONSIBILITY TO SUBCONTRACTS. TOO OFTEN WHEN PLANS SUBCONTRACT TO ENSURE ENROLLEES GET ACCESS TO REQUIRED SERVICE THESE. RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING THE SERVICES GET LOST AS A RESULT OF POORLY MANAGED SUBCONTRACTS MEDI CAL ENROLLEES CAN EXPERIENCE A LAYS IN THEIR KEY CARE AS SEEN IN TWO DIFFERENT WHISTLE BLOWER CASES IN LESS THAN A YEAR. THAT IMPACTED THOUSANDS OF MEDI CAL ENROLLEES. AND REPORTED THAT PATIENTS WERE IMPROPERLY DENIED OR DELAYED CARE. THE VARYING LEVELS OF DELEGATION COMPLICATES MONITORING AND ACCOUNTABILITY SO THAT MEDI CAL ENROLLEES ARE LEFT TO RELY ON WHISTLEBLOWERS RATHER THAN A ROBUST OVERSIGHT MECHANISM. THIS BILL STRAIGHTENED STATE OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OVER MEDI CAL PLAN SUBCONTRACT AND DRIVE VOTE MEMBERS JESS CAM RANH WITHOUT ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WHAT CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB. FIVE OH THREE OVER 80% OF MEN A CALLOUS THIRTEEN MILLION ENROLLEES RECEIVE BENEFITS THROUGH MEDICARE MEDICAID MEDICARE PLANS THIS BILL MAKES IT CLEAR THAT MEDI CAL MANAGED CLEAR PAT. CARE PLANS BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. REGARDLESS OF SOME CAUGHT SUBCONTRACTING DELEGATION AND SUB DELEGATION. SB FIVE OH THREE WOULD REQUIRE THAT MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS. TO CONDUCT INTO MY AUDIENCES OF CONTRACTORS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES PATIENT CARE OFTEN SUFFERS IN THEIR LAYERS OF DELEGATION AND SUB DELEGATION OF THE APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY. FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB FIVE OH THREE AN ASPIRIN AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. YOU.

AUDITOR'S WHO WERE ACTUALLY COMPETENT WHO UNDERSTAND MANAGE CARE -- MECHANISMS. AND WE NEED A CONFORMITY BETWEEN. THE REGULATIONS AND LAWS BETTER -- IT MINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY INCONSISTENCIES.
