BIGGEST CONCERN WAS WE WERE AT

00:35:02.066 --> 00:35:03.901
CHALLENGES AND IN MY DISTRICT

00:35:03.968 --> 00:35:07.405
IS- AND FRANKLY WHEN YOU LOOK

00:35:07.472 --> 00:35:11.476
AT STATE PARKS INVESTMENTS-

00:35:11.542 --> 00:35:13.044
VERY FEW OF THEM ARE IN

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:16.314
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND- AND

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.915
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. BOB

00:35:17.982 --> 00:35:21.085
WAR IN RURAL AREAS- THE CAN TO

00:35:21.152 --> 00:35:23.588
BE HEAVILY CONCENTRATED ALONG

00:35:23.654 --> 00:35:26.123
THE COAST REGION FOR OBVIOUS

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:28.693
REASONS BUT BUT THEN WHEN YOU

00:35:28.759 --> 00:35:29.260
START TALKING ABOUT FUNDING

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:31.095
THOSE THEN THE MONEY GOES TO

00:35:31.162 --> 00:35:32.897

SUGGESTED COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS

00:35:47.345 --> 00:35:48.746
AND SO I THINK THAT MAY TAKE

00:35:48.813 --> 00:35:50.581
CARE OF THE ISSUE BECAUSE IS A

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:51.883
PROVISION IN ONE OF THE

00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:54.886
SUBSECTIONS THAT. THAT THE

00:35:54.952 --> 00:35:56.854

COVERED BY STATE CONSERVANCY

00:36:02.393 --> 00:36:03.094
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET-

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.296
CONSERVANCY IN DISTRICT IN ONE

00:36:05.363 --> 00:36:10.535
IT STAYS AT HIS LITTLE HAPPENED

00:36:10.601 --> 00:36:11.102

00:36:11.168 --> 00:36:15.473
THAT BIRDS DO YOU. AND I LADY

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.209

00:36:21.078 --> 00:36:22.613
WELL I KNOW THAT THE WILDLIFE

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.682
CONSERVATION BOARD WILL COVER.

00:36:24.749 --> 00:36:26.417
ANY AREA THAT'S NOT COVERED BY

00:36:26.484 --> 00:36:29.787
OF A CONSERVANCY UP BECAUSE WE

00:36:29.854 --> 00:36:31.355

00:36:31.422 --> 00:36:32.557
TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU THE

00:36:32.623 --> 00:36:35.793
SENATOR- THAT- COMMUNITIES GET

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.728
LEFT OUT ON MANY DIFFERENT

00:36:37.795 --> 00:36:40.731
LEVELS AND- AND HE SAID HE

00:36:40.798 --> 00:36:42.700
DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT SO WE

00:36:42.767 --> 00:36:43.501
WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE

00:36:43.568 --> 00:36:46.304
EXPLICITLY ASKED TO MAKE SURE

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:47.605
THAT RULERS WOULD BECAUSE SO

RANGER GOMEZ. IT IT IS MORE

LIKELY THAT A YOUNG INDIVIDUAL

00:37:01.419 --> 00:37:02.820
IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THE

00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:04.555
TRAINING NEAR THEIR HOME THEN

00:37:04.622 --> 00:37:05.723
IT AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO

THAT IS LEFT BEHIND TOO OFTEN

00:37:42.326 --> 00:37:43.794
BUT IS ACTUALLY THIS CENTRAL

00:37:43.861 --> 00:37:45.763
EQUITY HOLDER IN THIS WHOLE

00:37:45.830 --> 00:37:46.831
PUZZLE IF WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA

00:37:46.897 --> 00:37:50.334
SOLVE ALL THESE CRISES. IT HAS

00:37:50.401 --> 00:37:51.869
TO COME FROM THE COMMUNITY THE

00:37:51.936 --> 00:37:55.906
STEWARDS IN WHATEVER PLACE THEY

00:37:55.973 --> 00:37:58.643
LIVE AND THE- MAKE PEOPLE FEEL

00:37:58.709 --> 00:37:59.543
LIKE STRANGERS IN THEIR OWN

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:02.346
LAND AND DIDN'T ISOLATE THEM

00:38:02.413 --> 00:38:04.448
NOT JUST FROM OTHER BUT ALSO

00:38:04.515 --> 00:38:06.317
FROM THEIR NATURAL RESOURCES IS

00:38:06.384 --> 00:38:09.320
REALLY- A WASTE OF HUMAN

00:38:09.387 --> 00:38:11.455
POTENTIAL IN THIS STATE- I READ

00:38:11.522 --> 00:38:13.057

COUNTRY AND- AND A TIME THEN

00:38:20.197 --> 00:38:21.499
WERE THERE WAS THE THREAT OF A

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:24.301
LOST GENERATION. AND

00:38:24.368 --> 00:38:26.804
PRESERVATION LAUNCH THE

00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:28.906
CONSERVATION CORPS. MEN THEY

00:38:28.973 --> 00:38:31.475
PLANTED BILLIONS OF TREES AND

00:38:31.542 --> 00:38:32.376
PUT A WHOLE GENERATION TO WORK

00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:34.345
IN. THE NIGHT I FRANKLY THINK

00:38:34.412 --> 00:38:36.514
THAT- WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.716
REALLY BIG RIGHT NOW I DON'T

00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:39.950
THINK WE CAN AFFORD TO DO

00:38:40.017 --> 00:38:40.685
SOMETHING INCREMENTAL I

00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:42.353
APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE- YOU'VE

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.388
SORT OF. ACCEPTED THAT

00:38:44.455 --> 00:38:45.189
CHALLENGE IN A WAY AND REALLY

00:38:45.256 --> 00:38:46.991
TRIED TO EXPAND THIS TO MAKE IT

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:48.059
STATE WIDE TO HAVE A

00:38:48.125 --> 00:38:49.994
COMPREHENSIVE VISION I THINK.

00:38:50.061 --> 00:38:51.762
EVEN IF YOU ALL LOOK AT THE

00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:53.731
SCOPE OF THE PROJECTS- DON'T

00:38:53.798 --> 00:38:55.566
JUST THINK OF THIS AS A TREE

00:38:55.633 --> 00:38:57.802
ARMY- WHICH WE DO NEED TO

00:38:57.868 --> 00:38:59.403
TACKLE THE THREAT OF CLIMATE

00:38:59.470 --> 00:39:01.205
CHANGE AND- ALL THE HEAT ISLAND

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:03.607
EFFECT THAT IMPOSE BUT- THIS IS

00:39:03.674 --> 00:39:05.443
ALSO ABOUT DISASTER RECOVERY

00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:08.279
IN. AND RISK THIS IS ABOUT-

00:39:08.345 --> 00:39:09.613
DEALING WITH THE IMPACTS OF THE

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.717
DROUGHT. OR WILD FIRES THESE

00:39:12.783 --> 00:39:13.884
ARE ALL VERY REAL THINGS AND I

00:39:13.951 --> 00:39:15.786
THINK IN ALL HIGH SCHOOLERS WHO

00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:16.420
JUST WENT THROUGH THEIR

00:39:16.487 --> 00:39:17.922
GRADUATION CEREMONIES AND MAYBE

00:39:17.988 --> 00:39:19.657
LOOKING AT THE FUTURE NOT

00:39:19.724 --> 00:39:22.059
KNOWING WHERE THE BRIDGES- THIS

00:39:22.126 --> 00:39:23.360
IS THE YEAR TO BUILD THAT I

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:24.295
WOULD JUST NOTE THAT YOU KNOW

00:39:24.361 --> 00:39:26.430
UNFORTUNATELY. GIVEN THAT. THE

00:39:26.497 --> 00:39:27.932
DIFFICULT IN THE BUDGET IS A

00:39:27.998 --> 00:39:29.967
POLICY BILL BUT THE COMMUNITY

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.302
ACCESS AND NONPROFIT FUNDING

00:39:31.368 --> 00:39:32.636
THAT WAS SET ASIDE FROM THE

00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:35.039
BOND IN SIXTY EIGHT WAS CUT

00:39:35.106 --> 00:39:38.075
FROM THE BUDGET. AND I THINK

00:39:38.142 --> 00:39:39.110
YOU KNOW WE HAVE A BOND

00:39:39.176 --> 00:39:40.444
PROPOSAL IN THE SENATE AND WE

00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:42.947
MOVED OUT OF OUR HOUSE- THAT

00:39:43.013 --> 00:39:45.116
THAT. WOULD FIND EXACTLY THIS

00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:46.717
KIND OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

00:39:46.784 --> 00:39:48.786
PROGRAM AND I JUST. REGARDLESS

00:39:48.853 --> 00:39:50.054
OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH FUNDING

00:39:50.121 --> 00:39:51.589
THIS YEAR I THINK IT'S CRUCIAL

00:39:51.655 --> 00:39:52.990
TO ARCHITECT THE VISION AND

00:39:53.057 --> 00:39:54.959
SAID AND- I REALLY LAY OUT SOME

00:39:55.025 --> 00:39:57.461
HOPE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE SO- AT

00:39:57.528 --> 00:39:58.462
THE APPROPRIATE TIME I'D LOVE

TO BE ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR

00:40:00.364 --> 00:40:02.466

OBVIOUSLY A- AN ISSUE THAT WE

00:52:24.274 --> 00:52:26.877
DESPERATELY NEED TO TACKLE- ARE

00:52:26.943 --> 00:52:28.845
WILDFIRE RISK GOES UP EVERY

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:32.148
YEAR. AND WE'VE PLACE PEOPLE

00:52:32.215 --> 00:52:33.250
ARE WE'VE ALLOWED PEOPLE TO

00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:34.651
BUILD IN AREAS THAT WE PROBABLY

00:52:34.718 --> 00:52:36.786
SHOULDN'T HAVE QUITE FRANKLY SO

00:52:36.853 --> 00:52:37.954
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

00:52:38.021 --> 00:52:39.389
DEAL WITH IT AFTER THE FACT

00:52:39.456 --> 00:52:40.991
BECOMES A CHALLENGE BUT- I AM I

00:52:41.057 --> 00:52:42.926
WANT TO MAKE SURE I. I

00:52:42.993 --> 00:52:45.128
UNDERSTAND IT IF THERE IS A

00:52:45.195 --> 00:52:46.830
BUNCH OF MOVING PIECES SO- I

00:52:46.897 --> 00:52:48.532
APOLOGIZE IF THIS SEEMS

00:52:48.598 --> 00:52:51.434
DISJOINTED BUT- BUT AS I WAS

00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:55.772
READING THROUGH THE ANALYSIS- I

00:52:55.839 --> 00:52:58.108
JUST WASN'T SURE EXACTLY WHAT.

00:52:58.174 --> 00:52:58.575
SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO

00:52:58.642 --> 00:53:00.544
UNDERSTAND IS. WHAT ARE WE

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:03.280
GIVING WHAT AUTHORITY ARE WE

00:53:03.346 --> 00:53:03.713
GIVING TWO DIFFERENT

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:06.683
ORGANIZATIONS HOW. ARE RESIDENT

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:08.885

00:53:08.952 --> 00:53:10.987
A FORTY AND THEN WHO'S PAYING

00:53:11.054 --> 00:53:13.523
FOR IT RIGHT- AND ON AND ON

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:16.393
UNDER THE PROPOSED A LOT. THE

00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:21.164
LINE UNDER UNDER NUMBER. THREE

00:53:21.231 --> 00:53:23.967
IT IT IT THE SENTENCE DOESN'T

00:53:24.034 --> 00:53:25.268
SEEM TO MAKE SENSE TO ME AND I

00:53:25.335 --> 00:53:27.337
HAVE TO ADMIT THAT USING A MASK

00:53:27.404 --> 00:53:29.573
AND INHALING LIKE CARBON

00:53:29.639 --> 00:53:31.875
MONOXIDE FOR FIVE HOURS ADULTS

00:53:31.942 --> 00:53:33.810
OF THE BRAIN BUT WHEN IT SAYS

00:53:33.877 --> 00:53:37.047
THAT THAT- THAT CAL FIRE CAN

00:53:37.113 --> 00:53:38.748
DEVELOPING PROPOSED FOR THE

00:53:38.815 --> 00:53:40.116
LEGISLATURE FOR CONSIDERATION A

00:53:40.183 --> 00:53:42.319
FINANCIAL PENALTY STRUCTURE TO

00:53:42.385 --> 00:53:44.955
APPLY TO LAND OWNERS. FOR WHOM

00:53:45.021 --> 00:53:46.623
THE DIRECTOR HAS AUTHORIZED THE

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:48.358
REMOVAL OF VEGETATION IN

00:53:48.425 --> 00:53:49.659
CONSISTENT WITH APPLICABLE

00:53:49.726 --> 00:53:51.761
DEFENSE DEFENSIBLE SPACE

00:53:51.828 --> 00:53:53.897
REQUIREMENT AND IS MADE THE

00:53:53.964 --> 00:53:55.298
EXPENSE OF THE REMOVAL A LEAN

00:53:55.365 --> 00:53:58.168
UPON THE PROPERTY IS PROVIDED

00:53:58.234 --> 00:54:02.539
SO. HOW CAN READ IT HOW CAN.

00:54:02.606 --> 00:54:05.241
THE DIRECTOR AUTHORIZE THE

00:54:05.308 --> 00:54:07.344
INCONSISTENT WITH UP- I SEE I

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:09.045
GET IT WELL JUST NEED TO READ

00:54:09.112 --> 00:54:12.816
IT LIKE TEN TIMES SO MY CAN MY

00:54:12.882 --> 00:54:16.519
CONCERN IS THIS- CAL FIRE SAYS

00:54:16.586 --> 00:54:18.088
THE THESE ARE THE TREES IT NEED

00:54:18.154 --> 00:54:19.389
TO BE REMOVED HERE'S THE BRUSH

00:54:19.456 --> 00:54:21.491
YOU NEED TO GET RID OF AND THEY

00:54:21.558 --> 00:54:23.893
LOCAL COUNTY ORDINANCE SAYS

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.695
THOU SHALT NOT TAKE OUT ANY

00:54:25.762 --> 00:54:27.397
TREES THAT WE DON'T. GIVE YOU

00:54:27.464 --> 00:54:29.899
PERMISSION TO SO HOW DOES IT

00:54:29.966 --> 00:54:32.902
WORK WITH. WITH THAT THE- THOSE

00:54:32.969 --> 00:54:34.604
CHALLENGES WHERE. YOU KNOW

00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:36.373
LOCAL ENTITIES WANT TO BE ABLE

00:54:36.439 --> 00:54:39.042
TO KEEP. AT BOTH NUMBER ONE

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:40.110
LOCAL ENTITIES BUT TO THERE'S

00:54:40.176 --> 00:54:42.879
THIS POLICY OF. BEING GREEN AND

00:54:42.946 --> 00:54:45.915
THE GREEN IS MORE TREES AND-

00:54:45.982 --> 00:54:49.152
AND TAKING. CARBON OUT OF THE

00:54:49.219 --> 00:54:50.387
AT THE CARBON SAID

00:54:50.453 --> 00:54:52.122
SEQUESTRATION. IF YOU COULD IF

00:54:52.188 --> 00:54:54.958
YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT- AND

00:54:55.025 --> 00:54:58.628
THEN. THE. THE OTHER PART OF IT

00:54:58.695 --> 00:55:00.463
IS. WHERE DOES THE MONEY COME

00:55:00.530 --> 00:55:06.770
FROM. AND I HAVE A HARD TIME

00:55:06.836 --> 00:55:07.337
QUITE FRANKLY NOW THAT WE'RE

00:55:07.404 --> 00:55:09.873
DOING BUDGETS. TRYING TO FIGURE

00:55:09.939 --> 00:55:11.341
OUT HOW WE PRIORITIZE PEOPLE

00:55:11.408 --> 00:55:13.376
TAKING OUT TREES THAT ARE THAT

00:55:13.443 --> 00:55:14.878
LIVE IN WEALTHY NEIGHBORHOODS

00:55:14.944 --> 00:55:16.680
THAT HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL

00:55:16.746 --> 00:55:18.581
AND WE DO A GRANT PROGRAM SO WE

00:55:18.648 --> 00:55:19.983
CAN TAKE THAT STUFF OUT INSTEAD

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:21.384
OF PUTTING MONEY INTO SOCIAL

00:55:21.451 --> 00:55:22.819
SERVICES OR INTENT HEALTH

00:55:22.886 --> 00:55:24.888
THEIR- HEALTHCARE THAT KIND OF

00:55:24.954 --> 00:55:26.690
THING SO IF YOU COULD TALK TO

00:55:26.756 --> 00:55:29.259
BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES I- UPS OF

00:55:29.325 --> 00:55:32.395
COURSE. TO THE VISION YOU WERE

00:55:32.462 --> 00:55:35.231
REFERRING TO IS A- IS A STUDY

00:55:35.298 --> 00:55:37.200
IN PROPOSED KIND OFPROVISION

00:55:37.267 --> 00:55:39.436
IT'S NOT A ACTUAL ENACTMENT OF

00:55:39.502 --> 00:55:42.138
ANY PENALTY STRUCTURES I THINK

00:55:42.205 --> 00:55:45.008
THE WAY IT'S DRAFTED IT. HERE'S

00:55:45.075 --> 00:55:47.811
TO WOULD BE UP FULL. DEFENSIBLE

00:55:47.877 --> 00:55:50.947
SPACE CODE IS SO THAT WOULD.

00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:53.717
DELEGATE DOWN DATE TO COUNTIES

00:55:53.783 --> 00:55:56.586
SO IF COUNTIES HAD. YOU YOU YOU

00:55:56.653 --> 00:55:57.787
SINCE SOME KIND OF THIS ALREADY

00:55:57.854 --> 00:55:59.889
EXISTS RIGHT. OKAY THAT'S HOW

00:55:59.956 --> 00:56:00.457
THE ADMINISTERED I THINK THE

00:56:00.523 --> 00:56:02.058
IDEA WOULD BE IS THERE IS THERE

00:56:02.125 --> 00:56:03.860
SOME OTHER STRUCTURE THAT CAL

00:56:03.927 --> 00:56:05.361
FIRE WANTS TO COME UP WITH THE

00:56:05.428 --> 00:56:07.330
OFFER TO THE COUNTIES. AS SOME

00:56:07.397 --> 00:56:08.465
KIND OF ENFORCING MECHANISM BUT

00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:10.366
WE DON'T. YOU ONLY HAVE TO

00:56:10.433 --> 00:56:12.469
CROSS THE BRIDGE WITH THIS OF.

00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:16.206
STUDYING AT CONS NOT

00:56:16.272 --> 00:56:18.341
NECESSARILY AN ACTING IT BUT I.

00:56:18.408 --> 00:56:21.678
THE NUYS THAT THAT TO END IT IS

00:56:21.745 --> 00:56:24.047
VERY MUCH. ALL TO ME TWO IS

00:56:24.114 --> 00:56:24.647
WHEN THEY COME KNOCKING YOUR

00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:25.281
DOOR MAY YOU CAN'T THE LAN. YOU

00:56:25.348 --> 00:56:27.183
CAN'T GET THROUGH IT OR YOUR

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:27.984
YOU CAN BLOCK FOR OTHER

00:56:28.051 --> 00:56:29.619
REASONS- BUT I KNOW CENTER

00:56:29.686 --> 00:56:30.687
BONDING IS SIMPLER CONCERNS IN

00:56:30.754 --> 00:56:32.355
THEIR COMMUNITY WHERE. YOU GOT

00:56:32.422 --> 00:56:33.456
A PROJECT YOU WANT TO DO WHICH

00:56:33.523 --> 00:56:34.624
AGAIN BLOCKED FOR SOME REASON

00:56:34.691 --> 00:56:37.293
SO I APPRECIATE THAT

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:40.163
SENSITIVITY BUT THAT'S THE

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:42.298
GENERAL STRUCTURE IS A- LOCAL.

00:56:42.365 --> 00:56:43.233
LOCAL ORDINANCES TO BE TAKEN

00:56:43.299 --> 00:56:44.467
INTO ACCOUNT WE DO NEED TO

00:56:44.534 --> 00:56:47.837
CLARIFY THAT THOUGH IN THE IN

00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:48.471
THE IT IN THE BILL I'M HAPPY TO

00:56:48.538 --> 00:56:50.240
DO THAT AND THEN IN TERMS OF

00:56:50.306 --> 00:56:54.911
THE- COURT. RIGHT NOW THERE IS

00:56:54.978 --> 00:56:56.980
A MODEST AMOUNT I THINK IN THE

00:56:57.046 --> 00:56:58.381
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR

00:56:58.448 --> 00:57:00.750
DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTION-

00:57:00.817 --> 00:57:04.287
WORK- I WOULD SAY THAT PRIVATE

00:57:04.354 --> 00:57:04.988
LANDOWNERS ARE STILL

00:57:05.054 --> 00:57:06.856
RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN

00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:07.991
PRIVATE PROPERTY SAID DIDN'T

00:57:08.057 --> 00:57:09.993
EAT IT'S MORE TO MANAGE OUR

00:57:10.059 --> 00:57:11.928
LIABILITY ON OUR PUBLIC LANDS

00:57:11.995 --> 00:57:13.963
BUT ALSO. THE UNFORTUNATE

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:16.232
FEDERAL LANDS- ARE ONE OF THE

00:57:16.299 --> 00:57:18.535
BIG ISSUES OUT THERE SO RIGHT

00:57:18.601 --> 00:57:19.702
NOW CAL FIRE GRANTS ARE

00:57:19.769 --> 00:57:20.236
ACTUALLY AUTHORIZED TO GO

00:57:20.303 --> 00:57:22.672
SUBSIDIZE FEDERAL PLANS WHICH I

00:57:22.739 --> 00:57:24.073
FURTHER CAN'T GET MY HEAD

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:26.442
AROUND. WE WANT TO WRITE IT UP

00:57:26.509 --> 00:57:29.445
AND SORT OF ON THOSE AREAS. OF

00:57:29.512 --> 00:57:31.014
FINANCIAL IN CAPACITY ALSO

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:34.450
SUPER RICH AND I THINK RIGHT TO

00:57:34.517 --> 00:57:36.386
RAISE THOSE EQUITY CONCERNS I

00:57:36.452 --> 00:57:36.920
THINK THAT'S GOT THE LANDS

00:57:36.986 --> 00:57:41.825
WHICH WITH LOOK AT IT THIS. THE

00:57:41.891 --> 00:57:42.392
WHILE THE ERROR RESERVE BON

00:57:42.458 --> 00:57:44.961
DOES PROVISIONS IN IT THAT THAT

00:57:45.028 --> 00:57:47.230
WOULD SORT OF ADD SOME FUNDING

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:49.232
STREAM TO THAT- BUT WE CAN TAKE

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:51.334
A CLOSER LOOK AT THIS SORT OF

00:57:51.401 --> 00:57:53.837
EQUITY PIECE OF IT BECAUSE I

00:57:53.903 --> 00:57:56.306

INCREDIBLY WEALTHY COMMUNITY

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.621

01:04:02.772 --> 01:04:06.142
WHAT OVERALL STATE PROGRAM. TWO

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:07.510
FOUR RATIONALIZE OUR STATE

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:10.880
SHE'S WITH. ISSUES IT IS AN

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:13.015
AREA FRAUGHT WITH PERIL I WOULD

01:04:13.082 --> 01:04:17.687
SAY LOCAL AND TELL YOU IT IS

01:04:17.753 --> 01:04:20.957
THE ONLY WAY TO GET THROUGH AND

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:24.627
REALLY HAVE IT BEING. WHEN I

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:27.263
TRY TO BROUGHT ONE. PLAN FOR

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:28.030
THE STATE. IS GOING TO BE

01:04:28.097 --> 01:04:29.332
CRUCIAL SO THAT YOU KNOW. WE

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:29.966
HAVE WE'VE HAD A WERE DISASTER

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:31.167
COMING THERE'S A HILLSIDE IT'S

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:33.536
A BUT YOU THAT YOU'VE GOT A

01:04:33.603 --> 01:04:35.671
CLEAR IT- AND THERE ARE

01:04:35.738 --> 01:04:37.073
PROVISIONS UNDER CURRENT LAW

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:39.508
THAT THAT CAN BE WAIT- WHETHER

01:04:39.575 --> 01:04:41.010
THEY'RE BEING EXERCISED IN A

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:43.980
SYSTEMATIC MANNER AND REALLY

01:04:44.046 --> 01:04:46.182
DONE. WITH AN EYE FOR THAT HAVE

01:04:46.249 --> 01:04:48.050
A TERRORIST NATION BUT BUT WITH

01:04:48.117 --> 01:04:52.521
THE COPS EFFORT TO SAY. WE NEED

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:57.860
TO FIND SOME IN SOME THIRD PATH

01:04:57.927 --> 01:05:01.163
HERE I THINK. WE GET. THE KINDS

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:02.798
OF PROJECTS YOUR TALK ABOUT THE

01:05:02.865 --> 01:05:05.268
KINDS OF- CLEARANCES AND HOME

01:05:05.334 --> 01:05:07.703
HARDENING. WE JUST CUT A

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:08.804
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF

01:05:08.871 --> 01:05:11.207
THE BUDGET FOR THAT PROGRAM- OR

01:05:11.274 --> 01:05:13.175
WE DIDN'T THAT IT WAS PROPOSED

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:14.877
IN THE MAY REVISED- THE

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:17.013
GOVERNOR UP TO A PLAN FOR

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:19.215

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:21.217
DAHLE SOME OF THE ISSUES. WE'VE

01:05:21.284 --> 01:05:22.251

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:23.886
BOND WE'VE GOTTA HOME

01:05:23.953 --> 01:05:27.757
HARDENING- PLAN IN THERE SO I

01:05:27.823 --> 01:05:29.625
THINK THAT THERE ARE PATHWAYS

01:05:29.692 --> 01:05:32.495
TO GETTING THIS WORK DONE. BUT

01:05:32.561 --> 01:05:34.664
THE CURRENT APPROACH AT LEAST

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:37.033
IS REALLY NOT AS FOCUSED ON

01:05:37.099 --> 01:05:39.502
THOSE THAT RIGHT AROUND THE-

01:05:39.568 --> 01:05:42.638
IT'S MUCH SO WAY LIKE FOR UNDER

01:05:42.705 --> 01:05:44.073
