01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:19.589
REFERRING TO THE PRESENTATION

01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:22.258
AT DH CS PROVIDED AMAZING DATA

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:23.626
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:26.128
THE DATA PROVIDED ABOUT WHO IS

01:04:26.195 --> 01:04:27.997
SERVED BY BOTH MANAGED CARE AND

01:04:28.064 --> 01:04:29.632
OUR MENTAL HEALTH PLANS BUT A

01:04:29.699 --> 01:04:30.833
SNAPSHOT OF WHAT WE ACTUALLY

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:32.735
DO. DOES NOT INCLUDE SUBSTANCE

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:34.537
USE DISORDER SERVICES AND

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:37.039
REALLY ONLY FOCUSES ON BILLABLE

01:04:37.106 --> 01:04:41.244
SERVICES. AT THE SAME TIME AS

01:04:41.310 --> 01:04:42.979
WE KNOW DURING KOBE WE HAD A

01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:44.547
LOT OF OTHER IMPACTS OUR STATE

01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:46.382
HOSPITALS CLOSED AS WE HEARD

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:47.583
ABOUT TODAY- AS FAR AS

01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:48.751
ADMISSIONS WHICH FURTHER

01:04:48.818 --> 01:04:50.319
LIMITED OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS

01:04:50.386 --> 01:04:51.587
HIGHER LEVELS OF CARE FOR OUR

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:53.522
PATIENTS. AND WHILE PSYCHIATRIC

01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:55.291
EMERGENCIES DO DIP A LITTLE BIT

01:04:55.358 --> 01:04:57.093
AND A CRISIS WE FEAR THAT AT

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:57.960
SOME POINT THERE WOULD BE

01:04:58.027 --> 01:04:59.395
ADDITIONAL NEEDS ESPECIALLY

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:00.129
AMONG OUR CHILDREN AND

01:05:00.196 --> 01:05:02.131
ADOLESCENTS AND WE'VE SEEN THAT

01:05:02.198 --> 01:05:04.267
OUR NATIONAL AND STATE DATA. WE

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:06.135
SEEN FENTANYL RELATED OVERDOSES

01:05:06.202 --> 01:05:08.337
INCREASE AND STAFFING AND THE

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:10.539
PHYSICAL PLANT OF WHERE OUR

01:05:10.606 --> 01:05:12.308
SERVICE IS DELIVERED. ALSO

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:14.644
CAUSED A DIFFICULTY IN SIMPLY

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:16.612
BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE ARE WE

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:17.146
ARE STRUCTURED TO DELIVER

01:05:17.213 --> 01:05:19.882
SERVICES. AND PROVIDERS ARE

01:05:19.949 --> 01:05:21.517
REALLY CAUGHT IN A BIND

01:05:21.584 --> 01:05:22.952
STRUGGLING TO RETAIN THEIR

01:05:23.019 --> 01:05:25.588
STAFF I'VE HAD THREE OF MY

01:05:25.655 --> 01:05:27.857
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STAFF DIE OF

01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:30.326
KOBE IN THE PAST MONTH. WE HAVE

01:05:30.393 --> 01:05:32.628
HAD COUNTLESS STAFF WHO LOST

01:05:32.695 --> 01:05:34.096

PARENT THEIR CHILDREN TO THIS

01:05:36.299 --> 01:05:38.668
VIRUS AND YET. MANY STILL COME

01:05:38.734 --> 01:05:42.505
TO WORK. IN FACT IN ONE AREA OF

01:05:42.571 --> 01:05:43.939
OUR COUNTY IN SAN BERNARDINO

01:05:44.006 --> 01:05:45.641
COUNTY AND VICTORVILLE IN

01:05:45.708 --> 01:05:48.177
BARSTOW AREA THAT SERVE ABOUT

01:05:48.244 --> 01:05:49.145
SIX THOUSAND OPEN CASES

01:05:49.211 --> 01:05:50.946
EVERYONE OF OUR PSYCHIATRIC

01:05:51.013 --> 01:05:53.516
NURSES HAD KOBE AND THEY WERE

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:56.619
ALL OUT AT THE SAME TIME. THESE

01:05:56.686 --> 01:05:59.055
ARE NURSES WHO GIVE. LONG

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:00.356
ACTING ANTI PSYCHOTIC

01:06:00.423 --> 01:06:02.358
INJECTIONS AND MEDICATED

01:06:02.425 --> 01:06:03.526
ASSISTED TREATMENT TO OUR

01:06:03.592 --> 01:06:05.161
CLIENTS THERE WAS NO ONE TO

01:06:05.227 --> 01:06:07.229
PROVIDE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO

01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:08.297
WORK WITH OUR RELATIONSHIPS

01:06:08.364 --> 01:06:09.398
THAT ARE LOCAL PHARMACIES AND

01:06:09.465 --> 01:06:10.966
OUR PHARMACISTS DID THAT WORK

01:06:11.033 --> 01:06:12.168
FOR US FOR THE TWO WEEKS THAT

01:06:12.234 --> 01:06:14.370
WE HAD NURSES OUT FOR KOBE. WE

01:06:14.437 --> 01:06:15.771
HAD NO NURSES IN ANY OTHER PART

01:06:15.838 --> 01:06:17.707
OF OUR COUNTY TO MOVE UP THE

01:06:17.773 --> 01:06:19.842
HILL. AND WHERE IS THIS THE

01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:22.611
STATE'S MOHAWKS THE MEDICAL

01:06:22.678 --> 01:06:23.412
HEALTH OPERATIONAL AREA

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:25.514
COORDINATOR. OUT REALLY WAS

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:27.016
STRUCTURE TO SUPPLY HIGHLY

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:28.718
SKILLED HEALTH CARE PERSONNEL

01:06:28.784 --> 01:06:31.587
DURING SUCH CRISES. THEY DON'T

01:06:31.654 --> 01:06:33.923
HAVE PSYCHIATRIC. AND SO WHAT

01:06:33.989 --> 01:06:35.791
THAT MEANS IS THAT OUR

01:06:35.858 --> 01:06:37.293
PSYCHIATRIC NURSES AND OTHER

01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.362
STAFF WHO ARE NEEDED FOR A

01:06:39.428 --> 01:06:41.564
CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS ARE

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.499
PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITIES.

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:46.001
ARE NOT ABLE TO- OF BE

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:49.238
LEVERAGED IN SACRAMENTO FOR

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:51.140
EXAMPLE AT THE- PSYCHIATRIC

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:52.575
HEALTH FACILITY A FIFTEEN BED

01:06:52.641 --> 01:06:55.478
FACILITY AND FIRST THEY HAD TO

01:06:55.544 --> 01:06:56.979
CLOSE BECAUSE ALL OF THEIR

01:06:57.046 --> 01:06:59.315
STAFF GOT KOBE. SHORTLY

01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:00.983
THEREAFTER THEY RE OPENED ONLY

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:02.952
TO HAVE AN OUTBREAK WITH ALL OF

01:07:03.018 --> 01:07:05.521
THEIR PATIENTS. ONLY NOW ARE

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:07.990
THEY OUT OF QUARANTINE. BUT IT

01:07:08.057 --> 01:07:09.158
HAS NOW RESULTED IN LONG

01:07:09.225 --> 01:07:10.559
LASTING EFFECTS ON THE WORK

01:07:10.626 --> 01:07:13.596
FORCE AND THEIR CO FOURTEEN

01:07:13.662 --> 01:07:14.530
FOUR PEOPLE AT A TIME TO COME

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:16.799
IN IMAGINE DOING THAT AND ANY

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:18.768
OTHER ROUND OF HEALTH CARE.

01:07:18.834 --> 01:07:20.069
THAT YOU WOULD ONLY TAKE FOR

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:21.804
WOMEN IN MATERNITY CARE BACK TO

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:22.972
THE BIRTHING CENTER WHEN YOU

01:07:23.038 --> 01:07:25.107
HAVE FOUR RIGHT ONE COMES AND

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:26.041
THEY'RE IN LABOR YOU HAVE TO

01:07:26.108 --> 01:07:27.276
WAIT WE'RE GONNA WAIT WE HAVE

01:07:27.343 --> 01:07:29.412
TOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO GO BACK.

01:07:29.478 --> 01:07:31.046
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DEALING. I

01:07:31.113 --> 01:07:31.947
WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT OUR STATE

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:33.616
PARTNERS HAVE WORKED VERY HARD

01:07:33.682 --> 01:07:35.718
TO MAKE UP. THE STRUCTURAL GAPS

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:37.920
OVER THE PAST YEAR AND WHAT. WE

01:07:37.987 --> 01:07:39.155
HAVE RECEIVED AN REGULATORY

01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:40.723
FLEXIBILITIES AND GUIDANCE

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:42.224
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE

01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:43.759
WITHOUT THEIR DEDICATION AND

01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:45.161
PERSISTENCE IN OVERCOMING THESE

01:07:45.227 --> 01:07:46.996
BARRIERS. BUT THE FACT IS AT

01:07:47.062 --> 01:07:48.297
THE END OF THE DAY COUNTY

01:07:48.364 --> 01:07:49.899
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HAD TO FIGHT.

01:07:49.965 --> 01:07:51.667
ON BEHALF OF OUR CLIENTS. ARE

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:53.903
WORK FORCES AND OUR SERVICES

01:07:53.969 --> 01:07:56.205
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. MOST OF

01:07:56.272 --> 01:07:57.239
OUR CONGREGATE RESIDENTIAL

01:07:57.306 --> 01:07:59.508
FACILITIES ARE LICENSED BY DCS

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:01.877
AND CDS THAT'S NOT. A

01:08:01.944 --> 01:08:02.411
CALIFORNIA PART OF PUBLIC

01:08:02.478 --> 01:08:04.480
HEALTH. LIKE A SKILLED NURSING

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:06.415
FACILITY OR HOSPITAL. AND SO IT

01:08:06.482 --> 01:08:07.383
WAS ALMOST A YEAR INTO THE

01:08:07.450 --> 01:08:08.717
PANDEMIC BEFORE THE STATE WAS

01:08:08.784 --> 01:08:10.019
ABLE TO GATHER ALL OF THOSE

01:08:10.085 --> 01:08:11.487
THREE ENTITIES TOGETHER SO WE

01:08:11.554 --> 01:08:13.255
CAN BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT. HEALTH

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:15.090
IMPACTS. AND THESE GAPS

01:08:15.157 --> 01:08:17.927
PERSIST. WELL INDIVIDUALS AS

01:08:17.993 --> 01:08:19.395

SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDER

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:24.800
HAVE THE SECOND HIGHEST RISK OF

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:28.337
MORTALITY TO COOK IN NINETEEN

01:08:28.404 --> 01:08:29.705
ONLY BEHIND H. THE UP. STATE

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.340
BAXEEN PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:33.209

01:08:33.275 --> 01:08:34.910
INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE MENTAL

ILLNESS OR SUBSTANCE USE

01:08:36.278 --> 01:08:37.847
DISORDERS. AND THAT WILL MEAN

01:08:37.913 --> 01:08:38.848
THAT WE WILL NEED TO FIGHT ONCE

01:08:38.914 --> 01:08:40.182
AGAIN TO ENSURE OUR HIGH RISK

01:08:40.249 --> 01:08:41.684
CLIENTS CAN GET IN THE QUEUE

01:08:41.750 --> 01:08:43.953
FOR VACCINES. WE HAD TO LIFT UP

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:45.120
OUR OWN VACCINE CLINICS FOR

01:08:45.187 --> 01:08:46.422

NURSES KNOW HOW TO GIVE A

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:52.261
VACCINE. BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:54.530

FROM THE COBIT NINETEEN

01:11:05.894 --> 01:11:08.931
PANDEMIC SO FAR- ONE THING I

01:11:08.998 --> 01:11:10.099
WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSCORE IS THE

01:11:10.165 --> 01:11:12.001
BI DIRECTIONAL ASSOCIATION

01:11:12.067 --> 01:11:13.502
WHICH RESEARCHERS ARE FINDING

01:11:13.569 --> 01:11:16.205
EMERGING BETWEEN COPE AT

01:11:27.449 --> 01:11:29.118
SUSCEPTIBLE TO COPE IN NINETEEN

01:11:29.184 --> 01:11:30.986
INTERACTION AND MORTALITY WE

01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:32.321
THINK THAT THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:33.789
THING TO KEEP AN EYE ON AS WE

01:11:33.856 --> 01:11:35.024
MOVE FORWARD AND THINK ABOUT

01:11:35.090 --> 01:11:36.191
PRIORITIZATION RELATED

01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:37.593
SPECIFICALLY TO COOK AT

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:40.529
NINETEEN- THERE IS ALSO AS WE

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:42.297
WILL HEAR ABOUT IN THE HEARING

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:44.233
OF THE WINNING. EPIDEMIC OF

01:11:44.299 --> 01:11:45.634

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:51.507
ALCOHOL AND- ALL OF THESE

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:53.008
CONDITIONS WILL HAVE A LASTING

01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:54.543
IMPACT ON OUR STATE FOR

01:11:54.610 --> 01:11:57.346
GENERATIONS TO COME- SO MUCH OF

01:11:57.413 --> 01:11:59.348
THE BROADER EFFORT TO STOP THE

01:11:59.415 --> 01:12:00.716
SPREAD OF THE VIRUS HAS REALLY

01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:02.451
BEEN ABOUT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT

01:12:02.518 --> 01:12:04.653
WE HAVE A LIMITED CAPACITY OF

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.188
HOSPITAL TO ADDRESS THE

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:08.190
PHYSICAL HEALTH NEEDS OF PEOPLE

01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:10.926
WITH A COOK AT NINETEEN- BUT

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.227
ONE OF THE THINGS AREAS WHERE

01:12:12.294 --> 01:12:13.529
WE BELIEVE WE FALLING SHORT.

01:12:13.595 --> 01:12:14.363
IT'S BEEN ADEQUATELY

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:16.932
UNDESTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:18.834
BETWEEN THAT PSYCHIATRIC

01:12:18.901 --> 01:12:21.036
EMERGENCIES AND ILLNESS AND

01:12:21.103 --> 01:12:21.837
THOSE THEIR VERY THING

01:12:21.904 --> 01:12:29.611
HOSPITALS AND SO- WE BELIEVE

01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:31.613
THAT LIVING. WE NEED TO REALLY.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.383
PSYCHIATRIC IN TECH AND- THANK

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:35.784
YOU THIRD PLANNING RELATED TO

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:38.987
COST AND- WE SAW WITH THE PANDA-

01:12:39.054 --> 01:12:40.823
THAT THERE. THAT THAT ARE

01:12:40.889 --> 01:12:42.157
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS AT

01:12:42.224 --> 01:12:44.393
ALL LEVELS OF HIGHER LEVEL AS

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:45.961
WELL AS LOWER LEVELS OF ACUTE

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:48.630
LEVEL WERE IMPACTED BY COBIT

01:12:48.697 --> 01:12:50.032
NINETEEN OUTBREAKS AND SO.

01:12:50.099 --> 01:12:51.967
THERE NEEDS TO BE- SOME

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:54.436
PLANNING DONE AROUND THAT THE

01:12:54.503 --> 01:12:56.772
SERVICES ARE BOTH MEDICAL AS

01:12:56.839 --> 01:12:58.741
WELL AS NON MEDIC HELD DUE TO

01:12:58.807 --> 01:13:01.243
THE I AND D. EXCLUSION WHICH DR

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:04.646
KELLY REFERENCED. AND SO- OUR

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:06.115
OUR COMMUNITY OF PROVIDERS HAVE

01:13:06.181 --> 01:13:08.484
REALLY ADJUSTED AS THEY CAN BUT

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:10.552
WITH VERY LITTLE SUPPORT AND NO

01:13:10.619 --> 01:13:13.489
EXTRA RESOURCING TO DO SO- THE

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:14.757
PHYSICAL PLANT OF THE

01:13:14.823 --> 01:13:17.126
FACILITIES IS. ALREADY SMALL

01:13:17.192 --> 01:13:18.894
AGAIN BECAUSE OF HOW WE ARE

01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:20.963
HE'D AND THE FEDERAL RULES FOR

01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:23.932
PAYMENT AND SO- ANY ADDITIONAL

01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:26.101
CAPACITY WOULD REQUIRE AN

01:13:26.168 --> 01:13:27.636
INTENTIONAL AND DEDICATED

01:13:27.703 --> 01:13:30.439
RESOURCE- TO ADDRESS OUR UNIQUE

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:33.776
SYSTEM- WHEN IT COMES TO OF FOR

01:13:33.842 --> 01:13:36.311
EXAMPLE ALTERNATIVE CARE SITES.

01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:38.847
OR A HOUSING WHICH WAS PROVIDED

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:40.716
BY THE STATE THERE WERE

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:42.918
DISCRIMINATORY BARRIERS PUT IN

01:13:42.985 --> 01:13:44.887
PLACE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS

01:13:44.953 --> 01:13:47.956
WELL AS LOCALLY WHICH- LOOTED

01:13:48.023 --> 01:13:49.658
OUR CLIENTS FROM ACCESSING

01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:51.760
THOSE RESOURCES ON PAR WITH

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:53.829
OTHER INDIVIDUALS. WE BELIEVE

01:13:53.896 --> 01:13:55.030
THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:57.299
MOVING FORWARD- AND WITH

01:13:57.366 --> 01:13:59.101
RESPECT TO FUNDING AGAIN THERE

01:13:59.168 --> 01:14:02.204
NEEDS TO BE DEDICATED RESOURCE

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:03.438
FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:14:03.505 --> 01:14:05.407
FACILITIES AND PROVIDERS AND

01:14:05.474 --> 01:14:06.508
SYSTEMS BECAUSE OF THE

01:14:06.575 --> 01:14:08.443
CATEGORICAL NATURE OF COUNTY

01:14:08.510 --> 01:14:09.845
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FUNDING.

01:14:09.912 --> 01:14:12.648
WHICH LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO-

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:13.982
MOVE FUNDING AROUND OR DRAW

01:14:14.049 --> 01:14:16.018
FROM DIFFERENT AS FUNDING

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:18.520
STREAMS IN AN EMERGENCY SUCH AS

01:14:18.587 --> 01:14:21.423
THIS ONE- MOVING FORWARD IT

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:27.863
WILL BE ESSENTIAL FOR MORE.

01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:28.463

DISASTER COMMANDING CONTROL.

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:40.008
BUT WE BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT

01:14:40.075 --> 01:14:41.677
FOR THE STATE TO ALSO CONSIDER

01:14:41.743 --> 01:14:43.078
RECRUITING AND EMBEDDING MORE

OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS AND I

01:39:17.184 --> 01:39:20.521
JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE THE

01:39:20.587 --> 01:39:21.121

ALICE'S. I AM I THINK DISTRICTS

01:39:23.757 --> 01:39:25.225
LOAN PART IN HERE THE

01:39:25.292 --> 01:39:26.760
COMMISSION A FEW YEARS AGO

01:39:26.827 --> 01:39:29.129
RECOGNIZE THAT IN SOME WAYS WE

01:39:31.165 --> 01:39:33.067
INCENTIVES THAT MAKE IT VERY

01:39:33.133 --> 01:39:34.935
DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOLS AND

01:39:35.002 --> 01:39:35.469
COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:39:35.536 --> 01:39:37.304
DEPARTMENTS TO PARTNER WE HAVE

NATURALLY THROUGH THE

01:39:40.908 --> 01:39:41.975
LEADERSHIP OF JUST SOME

01:39:42.042 --> 01:39:44.978

BUT GENERALLY THESE

01:39:47.247 --> 01:39:48.615
PARTNERSHIPS TEND TO BE THE

01:39:48.682 --> 01:39:50.451
EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE ROLE

01:39:50.517 --> 01:39:52.119
SO THE COMMISSION WORKED TO

01:39:52.186 --> 01:39:54.021

01:40:02.830 --> 01:40:05.232
PARTNERS WAS INCREDIBLE. AND

01:40:05.299 --> 01:40:07.668
THAT THAT LED TO THAT PASSAGE

01:40:07.735 --> 01:40:09.970
AND SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:40:15.876 --> 01:40:16.844
KINDS OF PARTNERSHIPS. THE

01:40:16.910 --> 01:40:18.512
COMMISSION THAT THIS WORD

01:40:18.579 --> 01:40:20.647
BECAUSE OF A COUPLE A HANDFUL

01:40:20.714 --> 01:40:22.716
OF FUNDAMENTAL RATIONALES.

01:40:22.783 --> 01:40:24.184
FIRST IS THAT CHILDREN ARE IN

01:40:24.251 --> 01:40:25.986
SCHOOL AND SO SCHOOLS CREATE

01:40:26.053 --> 01:40:29.556

THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND SO

01:40:35.362 --> 01:40:38.232
THEY BECOME VERY EFFICIENT AND

01:40:38.298 --> 01:40:38.799
EFFECTIVE WAYS THAT WE CAN

01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:41.368
ENGAGE. IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING

01:40:41.435 --> 01:40:44.104

THAT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES

01:40:46.273 --> 01:40:47.975

OFTEN HIGHEST WITH SCHOOLS AND

01:40:51.945 --> 01:40:53.714
SO THAT HIGH LEVEL OF TRUST THE

01:40:53.781 --> 01:40:56.049
ACCESS THAT SCHOOLS. CREATE FOR

01:40:56.116 --> 01:40:57.518
CHILDREN THEN YOU REALLY

01:40:57.584 --> 01:40:59.553
CREATES A NATURAL OPPORTUNITY

FIND THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WERE

START OF SCHOOL IN. OVER THE

01:42:14.061 --> 01:42:15.696
SUMMER IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

01:42:15.762 --> 01:42:17.064
THAT OUR LOCAL PARTIES WOULD BE

01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:18.398
ABLE TO LAUNCH NEW PROGRAMS

01:42:18.465 --> 01:42:20.033
BEFORE STUDENTS RETURN BUT IT

01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:21.535
DOES MEAN THAT WE CAN GET GOING

01:42:21.602 --> 01:42:23.537
VERY QUICKLY. WITH A LEVEL OF

01:42:23.604 --> 01:42:24.872

RECORD. THAT FULLY FUNDING

01:42:44.424 --> 01:42:46.093
WOULD TAKE A LITTLE OVER EIGHTY

01:42:46.159 --> 01:42:47.628
MILLION DOLLARS. BUT I ALSO

01:42:47.694 --> 01:42:48.929
WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT EVEN

01:42:48.996 --> 01:42:50.931
FULLY FUNDED THAT WOULD MEAN

01:42:50.998 --> 01:42:52.533
TWENTY COUNTIES WOULD NOT BE

01:42:52.599 --> 01:42:53.600

COUNTIES THAT ARE PARTICIPATING

01:42:56.703 --> 01:42:58.438
THE SIZE OR SCALE OF THESE

01:42:58.505 --> 01:43:00.574
GRANTS. FALLS SHORT OF WHAT

01:43:00.641 --> 01:43:02.643
ACTUALLY IS NEEDED IF WE WANT

01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:04.878
TO DELIVER CARE OR BUILD OUT

01:43:11.752 --> 01:43:12.286
ARE A DOWN PAYMENT OR STARTING

01:43:12.352 --> 01:43:14.922
POINT. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING

01:43:14.988 --> 01:43:17.357
INCENTIVES JUST TO STRENGTHEN

01:43:17.424 --> 01:43:18.392
THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

01:43:18.458 --> 01:43:20.193

SUPPORT THEIR SUCCESS BY

01:43:24.464 --> 01:43:25.132
LOOKING AT MODELS FOR

01:43:30.604 --> 01:43:32.506
EFFECTIVE ACROSS SUCH A DIVERSE

01:43:32.573 --> 01:43:34.207

01:43:38.312 --> 01:43:39.813
OUR CAPACITY TO UNDERSTAND

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:40.881
WHICH OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE

01:43:40.948 --> 01:43:43.250
WORKING AND TO LEARN FROM THE

01:43:43.317 --> 01:43:45.319
PROGRESS THAT HAPPENS OVER TIME

01:43:45.385 --> 01:43:46.820
AND WE NEED TO REVISIT SOME OF

01:43:46.887 --> 01:43:48.488
OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES AT

01:43:48.555 --> 01:43:50.624
THE STATE LEVEL THAT MAY HINDER

01:43:50.691 --> 01:43:52.259
OR WE HOPE ACTUALLY SUPPORT AND

01:43:52.326 --> 01:43:54.061
ENHANCE THE ABILITY OF OUR

SUCCESSFUL. THIS FROM THE

01:43:57.097 --> 01:43:58.432
COMMISSION'S PERSPECTIVE THE

01:43:58.498 --> 01:44:01.401
STATE REALLY NEEDS TO EMBRACE

01:44:01.468 --> 01:44:03.203
THESE PARTNERSHIPS IN WAYS

01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:05.505
WHERE WE CAN ALL SHARE RISK AND

ON CAPACITY BUILDING IS REALLY

01:44:15.949 --> 01:44:18.018
IMPORTANT BECAUSE QUITE OFTEN

01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:19.419
WE HEARD THIS LAST WEEK IN A

01:44:19.486 --> 01:44:20.621

FIGURED OUT SOME OF THESE

01:44:28.595 --> 01:44:30.564
ISSUES AND ARE FAR ALONG. MANY

01:44:30.631 --> 01:44:32.432
OTHERS HAVE YET TO BENEFIT FROM

01:44:37.504 --> 01:44:39.840
LESSONS. THERE'S A FEW OTHER

01:44:39.906 --> 01:44:40.607
COMPONENTS THAT WE'RE VERY

01:44:40.674 --> 01:44:42.643

THEY HAVE ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS

01:44:58.025 --> 01:45:00.460
OFTEN DIVERGE FROM WHAT SOME OF

01:45:05.766 --> 01:45:06.933
AREA WHERE THE COMMISSION FEELS

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.535

01:45:33.527 --> 01:45:34.761
PROGRAMS THAT WILL NEED TO

01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:39.433
EVOLVE OVER TIME AS WE LEARN.

01:45:39.499 --> 01:45:39.933
AND AS WE INTEGRATE THE

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:40.867
STRATEGIES. I'M GONNA SHIP

SERIES OF YEARS DROPPING MODELS

01:45:49.276 --> 01:45:50.944
BASED ON A MODEL OUT OF

01:45:51.011 --> 01:45:53.046
AUSTRALIA CALLED HEADSPACE. AND

01:45:53.113 --> 01:45:54.414
IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE BUILDING

01:45:54.481 --> 01:45:56.383

HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE

01:46:03.757 --> 01:46:05.459
EFFECTIVE AROUND THE WORLD

01:46:05.525 --> 01:46:06.727
REALLY BEGINS WITH THE PREMISE

01:46:06.793 --> 01:46:08.061
THAT YOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO BE

01:46:08.128 --> 01:46:09.463

01:46:15.502 --> 01:46:16.903
SERVICES AND THE WAY IN WHICH

WE ARE TRYING TO WORK THROUGH

01:46:45.265 --> 01:46:47.434
THE DAHLE GOALS OF FIDELITY TO

01:46:47.501 --> 01:46:49.903
THE MODEL. WHILE ALSO REMOVING

01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:52.606

01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:08.321
BALANCE SUPPORTING FIDELITY

01:47:08.388 --> 01:47:10.323
THIS WELL ESTABLISHED MODEL IN

01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:10.957
THIS CAPACITY TO SCALE

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:27.808
SEEING THIS MODEL LEFT RATE IN

01:47:27.874 --> 01:47:29.543
CALIFORNIA. WE REALLY ARE

01:47:29.609 --> 01:47:31.278
HOWEVER JUST GETTING STARTED

01:47:31.344 --> 01:47:32.279
BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF

01:47:32.345 --> 01:47:34.815
THE TASK- IT'S WHAT FOR A MODEL

01:47:34.881 --> 01:47:35.549
THAT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED

01:47:35.615 --> 01:47:41.755
ELSEWHERE AND. AND THAT WE'RE

01:47:41.822 --> 01:47:42.255
TRYING TO ADAPT YEAR IN

01:47:42.322 --> 01:47:43.290
CALIFORNIA. THE THIRD ISSUE

01:47:43.356 --> 01:47:44.224
THAT I WANT TO MENTION. AS

01:47:44.291 --> 01:47:45.826
OUTLINED IN THE NON IS EARLY

01:47:45.892 --> 01:47:46.626
PSYCHOSIS AND AGAIN WE- THE

01:47:46.693 --> 01:47:47.861
WRITER. THIS IS ANOTHER AREA

01:47:47.928 --> 01:47:49.162
WHERE WE'RE REALLY WORKING TO

01:47:49.229 --> 01:47:51.865
CREATE. JOE PREVENTION AND

01:47:51.932 --> 01:47:54.568
EARLY INTERVENTION LANDS. WE

01:47:54.634 --> 01:47:56.369
TRIED FOR THE PAST. I SHOULD

01:47:56.436 --> 01:47:58.538
SAY RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT

01:47:58.605 --> 01:48:00.040
THERE'S ABOUT AN EIGHTEEN MONTH

01:48:00.106 --> 01:48:01.808
DELAY IN ACCESSING CARE FOR

01:48:01.875 --> 01:48:02.742
PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING

01:48:02.809 --> 01:48:05.312
EARLY PSYCHOSIS EPISODE. IN

01:48:05.378 --> 01:48:07.280
CONTRAST WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM

01:48:07.347 --> 01:48:09.015
TOM INSULT THE FORMER DIRECTOR

01:48:09.082 --> 01:48:11.418

01:48:11.484 --> 01:48:12.719
HERE AS THERE ARE MENTAL HEALTH

01:48:12.786 --> 01:48:14.387
CZAR TO THE GOVERNOR. IS THAT

01:48:14.454 --> 01:48:16.356
THAT THAT DELAY IN THE UNITED

01:48:16.423 --> 01:48:17.591
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM IS ABOUT

01:48:17.657 --> 01:48:19.025
TWO WEEKS SO THERE'S AN

01:48:19.092 --> 01:48:20.126
EIGHTEEN MONTH DELAY IN

01:48:20.193 --> 01:48:21.094
ACCESSING HERE IN THE UNITED

01:48:21.161 --> 01:48:22.662
STATES AND ITS TWO WEEK DELAY

01:48:22.729 --> 01:48:24.164
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. SO THE

01:48:24.231 --> 01:48:25.298
QUESTION THAT THE COMMISSION

01:48:25.365 --> 01:48:27.167
ACTUALLY TRYING TO TACKLE IS

01:48:27.234 --> 01:48:28.668
HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT ALL

01:48:28.735 --> 01:48:33.640
CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS. TO

01:48:33.707 --> 01:48:35.609
SPRING SEKULA SAYS IN THE

01:48:35.675 --> 01:48:37.911
FASTEST TIME POSSIBLE. TO DO

01:48:37.978 --> 01:48:39.512
THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH A

01:48:39.579 --> 01:48:41.314
NUMBER OF COUNTY PARTNERS WITH

01:48:41.381 --> 01:48:43.149
UC DAVIS AS A SUBJECT MATTER

01:48:43.216 --> 01:48:44.584
EXPERT WE'RE CONNECTING WITH

01:48:44.651 --> 01:48:45.919
OTHER STATES THAT ARE WORKING

01:48:45.986 --> 01:48:47.020
TO BUILD OUT THEIR RELEASE

01:48:47.087 --> 01:48:49.256
ACOSTA STRATEGIES. AND THE

01:48:49.322 --> 01:48:51.224
TARGET HERE IS TO UNDERSTAND

01:48:51.291 --> 01:48:52.259
HOW WE CAN IMPROVE ACCESS TO

01:48:52.325 --> 01:48:54.027
CARE IN A TIMELY MANNER. IT

01:48:54.094 --> 01:48:56.096
REDUCES THE OFTEN MOST

01:48:56.162 --> 01:48:58.732
DIFFICULT MOST EXPENSIVE AND

01:48:58.798 --> 01:49:01.101
MOST IMPACTFUL. MENTAL HEALTH

01:49:01.167 --> 01:49:02.469

STATE HOSPITALS. WE WANT TO

01:49:14.881 --> 01:49:16.449
UNDERSTAND HOW CAN WE BUILD

01:49:16.516 --> 01:49:18.985
CAPACITY TO SCALE UP EVIDENCE

01:49:19.052 --> 01:49:21.221
BASED APPROACHES TO THESE EARLY

01:49:21.288 --> 01:49:23.156
PSYCHOSIS INTERVENTIONS THAT

01:49:23.223 --> 01:49:24.758
HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REALLY

01:49:24.824 --> 01:49:26.026
LOWER COSTS AND IMPROVE

01:49:26.092 --> 01:49:27.961
OUTCOMES AND DO SO IN A WAY

01:49:28.028 --> 01:49:29.930
THAT WE'RE PARTNERING. WITH NOT

01:49:29.996 --> 01:49:31.998

BIT LATER ON THE AGENDA- WE'RE

01:50:32.759 --> 01:50:35.028

IN OTHER AREAS OF HEALTHCARE

01:50:58.018 --> 01:50:59.786
WE'VE SEEN TREMENDOUS EFFORTS

01:50:59.853 --> 01:51:01.788
IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR TO CREATE

01:51:01.855 --> 01:51:03.490
GREATER AWARENESS AROUND THE

01:51:03.556 --> 01:51:05.658
REST OF STROKES FOR EXAMPLE AND

01:51:05.725 --> 01:51:06.860
HOW INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES

THIS OFTEN SUICIDE PREVENTION

02:27:41.652 --> 02:27:43.387
YES PLAN REALLY CALLS FOR

02:27:43.454 --> 02:27:45.489
BUILDING OUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:27:45.556 --> 02:27:47.325
TO SUPPORT SUICIDE PREVENTION

02:27:47.391 --> 02:27:48.960
THAT IS ABOUT IDENTIFYING BEST

02:27:49.026 --> 02:27:50.695
PRACTICES. AND DOING THE

02:27:50.761 --> 02:27:52.129

THEIR ADOPTION ACROSS THE STATE

02:27:55.399 --> 02:27:57.868
WE HAVE A VERY DISTRIBUTED

02:27:57.935 --> 02:27:58.869
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN

02:27:58.936 --> 02:28:00.605
THIS STATE. AND SUICIDE

02:28:00.671 --> 02:28:01.672
PREVENTION ISN'T JUST THE

02:28:01.739 --> 02:28:04.709
PURVIEW OF ONE ENTITY IT REALLY

02:28:04.775 --> 02:28:06.444
MEANS ENGAGING MULTIPLE

02:28:06.510 --> 02:28:08.512

ACROSS OUR COMMUNITIES. WE

02:28:12.683 --> 02:28:13.751
REALLY NEED TO BUILD OUT

02:28:13.818 --> 02:28:15.453
TRUSTED CHANNELS THAT PEOPLE

02:28:15.519 --> 02:28:18.689

INFORMATION ON SUICIDE THERE'S

02:28:21.959 --> 02:28:23.661
THIS PERSISTENT NOTION THAT

02:28:23.728 --> 02:28:25.162
TALKING TO PEOPLE ABOUT SUICIDE

02:28:25.229 --> 02:28:26.497
WILL INCREASE THE RISK OF

02:28:26.564 --> 02:28:28.566
SUICIDE WHEN IN FACT THE

02:28:28.633 --> 02:28:29.166
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT IT'S QUITE

02:28:29.233 --> 02:28:32.069
THE OPPOSITE. WE ALSO NEED TO

02:28:32.136 --> 02:28:33.571
REALLY BUT YOU NEED TO LOOK AT

02:28:33.638 --> 02:28:35.539
STRATEGIES TO MINIMIZE RISK BY

02:28:35.606 --> 02:28:37.508
PROMOTING SAFE ENVIRONMENTS WE

02:28:37.575 --> 02:28:38.743
NEED TO THINK ABOUT REDUCING

02:28:38.809 --> 02:28:40.478
ACCESS TO LETHAL MEANS AND SO

02:28:40.544 --> 02:28:41.579
THE LEGISLATURE HAS FOR

02:28:41.646 --> 02:28:43.714
EXAMPLE. FUNDED A BARRIER ON

02:28:43.781 --> 02:28:45.082
THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE TO

02:28:45.149 --> 02:28:47.551
REDUCE SUICIDE RESTS THERE. IN

02:28:47.618 --> 02:28:49.854
THIS COUNTRY WHERE WE- CAN USE

IT IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH

02:28:52.223 --> 02:28:53.791
SUICIDE ATTEMPTS AND THERE ARE

02:28:53.858 --> 02:28:55.526
SOME VERY EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS

02:28:55.593 --> 02:28:57.561
HAPPENING IN OUR COUNTIES IN

02:28:57.628 --> 02:28:59.664
OTHER STATES. THAT ARE WORKING

02:28:59.730 --> 02:29:01.766
WITH GUN CLUBS GUNS SHOPS AND

02:29:01.832 --> 02:29:04.101
GUN OWNERS TO CREATE POWERFUL

02:29:04.168 --> 02:29:05.736
MESSAGES TO SUPPORT PEOPLE WHO

02:29:05.803 --> 02:29:08.606
ARE GUN OWNERS. TO KEEP THEIR

02:29:08.673 --> 02:29:10.641
GUNS SAFELY LOCKED AWAY OR TO

02:29:10.708 --> 02:29:12.109
TRANSPORT LEGALLY TRANSFER

02:29:12.176 --> 02:29:14.011
THEIR GUNS TO A TRUSTED

02:29:14.078 --> 02:29:15.279
NEIGHBORS OR FAMILY MEMBERS

02:29:15.346 --> 02:29:16.881
DURING PERIODS OF CRISIS THAT

02:29:16.947 --> 02:29:20.251
WE CAN REDUCE ACCESS TO VEHICLE

02:29:20.318 --> 02:29:22.219
MEANS. WE ALSO HAVE TO. IMPROVE

02:29:22.286 --> 02:29:23.954
THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF

02:29:24.021 --> 02:29:25.323
RISKS AND IMPROVE THE

02:29:25.389 --> 02:29:27.591
CONNECTION TO SERVICES ONE OF

02:29:27.658 --> 02:29:28.726
THE AREAS THAT WE'RE WORKING

02:29:28.793 --> 02:29:31.262
ON. IS TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE

02:29:31.329 --> 02:29:32.963
KINDS OF SUICIDE SCREENING

02:29:33.030 --> 02:29:34.899
THAT'S HAPPENING AND HOW WE CAN

02:29:34.965 --> 02:29:36.567
CREATE A MORE STANDARDIZED

02:29:36.634 --> 02:29:38.135
APPROACH TO SUICIDE SCREENS AND

02:29:38.202 --> 02:29:39.804
BETTER UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF

02:29:39.870 --> 02:29:40.805
THE SCREENS AND WHAT THEY TELL

02:29:40.871 --> 02:29:43.040
US. ABOUT RISKS ACROSS THE

HAPPENING THROUGH SCHOOLS AND I

02:29:46.410 --> 02:29:47.445
MENTION THAT BECAUSE THE

02:29:47.511 --> 02:29:49.513
CONVERSATION I JUST HAD AROUND

02:29:49.580 --> 02:29:52.049
AS WELL HOW. AND LASTLY I WOULD

02:29:52.116 --> 02:29:55.319
SAY. WE ALSO NEED TO IMPROVE

02:29:55.386 --> 02:29:57.555
OUR SUICIDE RELATED SERVICES

02:29:57.621 --> 02:29:59.223

AFTER AN ASSESSMENT THERE ISN'T

02:30:16.273 --> 02:30:18.442

SUPPORT THESE INDIVIDUALS AND

02:30:21.278 --> 02:30:23.247
FAMILIES. BECAUSE THE RISK THAT

02:30:23.314 --> 02:30:25.015
MIGHT HAVE LED TO THE SUICIDAL

02:30:25.082 --> 02:30:26.884

02:55:06.362 --> 02:55:08.431
FOR STATE. ASSIST AS WELL AS

02:55:08.497 --> 02:55:10.166
QUESTION PERCENT PERSUADE AND

02:55:10.233 --> 02:55:12.368
REFER TRAININGS- ST ARE COUNTY

02:55:12.435 --> 02:55:14.136
THE ASSIST TRAINING. HAS BEEN

02:55:14.203 --> 02:55:15.071
PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO LAY

02:55:15.137 --> 02:55:18.007
PEOPLE. AND OUR VETERANS SYSTEM

02:55:18.074 --> 02:55:20.877
OF CARE MANY VETERANS ARE

02:55:20.943 --> 02:55:22.612
HESITANT TO REACH OUT TO THE

02:55:22.678 --> 02:55:24.313
CURRENT VETERANS ADMINISTRATION

02:55:24.380 --> 02:55:26.182
TO ADDRESS THEIR SUICIDALITY

02:55:26.249 --> 02:55:27.483
AND THEY'RE ALSO HAS A CHANCE

02:55:27.550 --> 02:55:29.552
TO REACH OUT. THROUGH NINE ONE

02:55:29.619 --> 02:55:30.753
ONE SO ASSIST HAS BEEN VERY

02:55:30.820 --> 02:55:33.356
HELPFUL IN REDUCING OUR NUMBERS

02:55:33.422 --> 02:55:37.460
OF COMPLETED SUICIDES. PER THE

02:55:37.526 --> 02:55:38.361
PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLING- WE HAVE

02:55:38.427 --> 02:55:39.929
DATA WE HAVE AN OFFICE WE WANT

02:55:39.996 --> 02:55:41.530
TO SHARE THAT THE DATA AND OUR

02:55:41.597 --> 02:55:43.132
BEST PRACTICES BECAUSE SUICIDE

02:55:43.199 --> 02:55:44.433
PREVENTION IS NOT SIMPLY

02:55:44.500 --> 02:55:46.502
ADDRESSED WITH A CRISIS LINE OR

02:55:46.569 --> 02:55:48.638
A HOTLINE. YEAH WE NEED TO

02:55:48.704 --> 02:55:50.039
REDUCE STIGMA TO INCREASE

02:55:50.106 --> 02:55:51.774
ACCESS TO NEEDED SERVICES

02:55:51.841 --> 02:55:53.142
FOCUSING ON MAKING MENTAL

02:55:53.209 --> 02:55:56.746
HEALTH. THE FOCUS BECAUSE WE

02:55:56.812 --> 02:55:59.148
ALL HAVE MENTAL HEALTH. WITH

02:55:59.215 --> 02:56:00.116
RESPECT TO SUBSTANCE USE

02:56:00.182 --> 02:56:01.250
DISORDER IN TREATMENT IN

02:56:01.317 --> 02:56:02.885
PARTICULAR OVERDOSE PREVENTION

02:56:02.952 --> 02:56:04.720
EACH COUNTY ALSO HAS A

02:56:04.787 --> 02:56:06.756
SUBSTANCE USE PREVENTION FIVE

02:56:06.822 --> 02:56:08.791
YEAR PLAN WITH MEASURABLE GOALS

02:56:08.858 --> 02:56:09.759
TIED TO ARE COUNTY SPECIFIC

02:56:09.825 --> 02:56:13.596
DATA PREVENTION PLANS ARE

02:56:13.663 --> 02:56:14.130
GROUNDED IN EVIDENCE BASED

02:56:14.196 --> 02:56:16.265
PRACTICES. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT

02:56:16.332 --> 02:56:18.167
TO KNOW BECAUSE PREVENTING

02:56:18.234 --> 02:56:20.603
ADDICTION FOR USE IS VERY

02:56:20.670 --> 02:56:22.238
DIFFERENT PROCESS THAN FOR IT

02:56:22.305 --> 02:56:24.173
UP ALL SO WE ARE REALLY FOCUSED

02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:26.142
ON STRATEGIES THAT TEND TO

02:56:26.208 --> 02:56:29.045
YOUTH VERSUS THOSE WHO ARE FOR

02:56:29.111 --> 02:56:32.214
ADULTS DIFFERENT BANKS- SO

02:56:32.281 --> 02:56:33.449
COUNTIES AT THE START OF THE

02:56:33.516 --> 02:56:35.384
PANDEMIC WE HAVE DONE A LOT TO

02:56:35.451 --> 02:56:36.185
KEEP OUTPATIENT SERVICES

02:56:36.252 --> 02:56:38.187
AVAILABLE VIA TELEHEALTH OR

02:56:38.254 --> 02:56:40.356
EVEN IN PERSON BUT ACCESS TO

02:56:40.423 --> 02:56:41.657
RESIDENTIAL SERVICES AND

02:56:41.724 --> 02:56:43.693
RECOVERY RESIDENTS FORCED OR

02:56:43.759 --> 02:56:45.661
SOBER LIVING ENVIRONMENTS HAS

02:56:45.728 --> 02:56:47.363
BEEN CHALLENGING DURING COLD

02:56:47.430 --> 02:56:48.698
BECAUSE OF THIS THE THINGS THAT

02:56:48.764 --> 02:56:49.699
WE MENTIONED IN OUR FIRST

02:56:49.765 --> 02:56:51.701
PANEL. FOR EXAMPLE RESIDENTIAL

02:56:51.767 --> 02:56:53.669
TREATMENT WOULD BENEFIT FROM

02:56:53.736 --> 02:56:55.171
SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING TO ADAPT

02:56:55.237 --> 02:56:56.806

INTO NEW ONES AND ALTHOUGH

02:56:58.541 --> 02:56:59.742
THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL AND

02:56:59.809 --> 02:57:01.811
UNNECESSARY MODEL STEP DOWNS

02:57:01.877 --> 02:57:04.747
RECOVERY RESIDENCES OR SOAKS UP

02:57:04.814 --> 02:57:06.482
LIVING ENVIRONMENTS- CANNOT BE

02:57:06.549 --> 02:57:08.484
FUNDED THROUGH MEDICARE. WE

02:57:08.551 --> 02:57:09.552
KNOW THE RISK OF OVERDOSE

02:57:09.618 --> 02:57:10.519
RELATED DEATHS IS

02:57:10.586 --> 02:57:12.388
OVERWHELMINGLY HIGH FOR THOSE

02:57:12.455 --> 02:57:13.789
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BEING

02:57:13.856 --> 02:57:16.025
RELEASED FROM INCARCERATION AND

02:57:16.092 --> 02:57:18.027
WE BELIEVE CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT

02:57:18.094 --> 02:57:19.895
WITH OUR PARTNERS AT CDC ARE

02:57:19.962 --> 02:57:21.464
REGARDING PRISON RELEASE

02:57:21.530 --> 02:57:23.833
POPULATIONS IS KEY. CDCR

02:57:23.899 --> 02:57:25.034
REPORTED THAT IT OFFERS

02:57:25.101 --> 02:57:27.570
NALOXONE OR NOR CAN I TO

02:57:27.636 --> 02:57:29.405
INMATES UPON DISCHARGE IN UP

02:57:29.472 --> 02:57:31.540
280% OF INMATES RECEIVED THAT

02:57:31.607 --> 02:57:32.908
THAT THAT MEDICATION WHICH

02:57:32.975 --> 02:57:34.944
INDICATES A REAL NEED TO ENSURE

02:57:35.011 --> 02:57:35.945
THAT THE STATE PROVIDES

02:57:36.012 --> 02:57:37.013
COUNTIES WITH ADEQUATE

02:57:37.079 --> 02:57:39.382
NOTIFICATION IN COORDINATION

02:57:39.448 --> 02:57:41.150
AROUND PRISON JUST CHARGES.

02:57:41.217 --> 02:57:42.284
OVERALL COMMUNITY BASED

02:57:42.351 --> 02:57:43.352
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER

02:57:43.419 --> 02:57:44.620
PREVENTION IS CURRENTLY FUNDED

02:57:44.687 --> 02:57:46.889
VERY MINIMALLY I WITH OUR SAM'S

02:57:46.956 --> 02:57:48.357
A BLOCK GRANT BUT THOSE FUNDS

02:57:48.424 --> 02:57:49.558
MUST COMPETE WITH OTHER BLACK

02:57:49.625 --> 02:57:51.027
GRANT SERVICES SUCH AS RECOVERY

02:57:51.093 --> 02:57:53.062
RESIDENTS SCHOOL BASED SERVICES

02:57:53.129 --> 02:57:54.730
THINGS THAT MIGHT NOT BE

02:57:54.797 --> 02:57:56.665
COVERED UNDER DRUG HOW. MUCH

02:57:56.732 --> 02:57:58.267
MORE SIGNIFICANT DEDICATED

02:57:58.334 --> 02:58:00.202
INVESTMENT WILL NEED TO BE MADE

02:58:00.269 --> 02:58:02.938
IN OPIOID OVERDOSE PREVENTION-

02:58:03.005 --> 02:58:04.440
THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT

02:58:04.507 --> 02:58:05.775
BECAUSE AS A SOME OF OUR

02:58:05.841 --> 02:58:07.743
PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE STATED

02:58:07.810 --> 02:58:10.246
THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT HEROIN

02:58:10.312 --> 02:58:12.648
OR OPIOIDS WE ARE SEEING

02:58:12.715 --> 02:58:15.351
FENTANYL WHICH IS AN OPIOID-

02:58:15.418 --> 02:58:17.520
ADULTERATED COCAINE AND

02:58:17.586 --> 02:58:19.288
METHAMPHETAMINE RESULTING AND A

02:58:19.355 --> 02:58:21.857
DIFFERENT KIND OF AN OVERDOSE.

02:58:21.924 --> 02:58:23.793
AND THAT MIGHT NOT BE AS EASILY

02:58:23.859 --> 02:58:28.831
TRACKED FOR THE CDPH DASHBOARD.

02:58:28.898 --> 02:58:29.465
AS MISS MORALIS STATED. IS MORE

02:58:29.532 --> 02:58:32.101
ON- SO WE NEED TO REALLY FOCUS

02:58:32.168 --> 02:58:34.136
ON ON OVERDOSE PREVENTION

02:58:34.203 --> 02:58:35.471
MOVING IT SO THAT IT'S MORE ON

02:58:35.538 --> 02:58:36.305
PAR WITH THE TYPE OF

02:58:36.372 --> 02:58:37.673
SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING COUNTIES

02:58:37.740 --> 02:58:39.408
RECEIVE THROUGH AN HSA EVER

02:58:39.475 --> 02:58:41.077
REALLY GOING TO GET SERIOUS

02:58:41.143 --> 02:58:43.212
ABOUT ADDICTION. THE THREAT OF

02:58:43.279 --> 02:58:44.680
FENNEL AGAIN IS WHAT WE'RE

02:58:44.747 --> 02:58:46.482
SEEING OVERDOSES AMONG OUR

02:58:46.549 --> 02:58:48.617
YOUNGER POPULATION TO MAKE

02:58:48.684 --> 02:58:50.486
LATIN ME LACK AWARENESS ABOUT.

02:58:50.553 --> 02:58:53.589
OF THE AT RISK OF OVERDOSES

02:58:53.656 --> 02:58:55.124
UNDER MEDI CAL ARE DRUG MEDI

02:58:55.191 --> 02:58:56.425
CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM

02:58:56.492 --> 02:58:57.960
ALLOWS FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT OF

02:58:58.027 --> 02:58:59.962
RESIDENTIAL DRUG TREATMENT

02:59:00.029 --> 02:59:01.163
WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE NOT BE

02:59:01.230 --> 02:59:02.965
FUNGIBLE UNDER THE I AM D.

02:59:03.032 --> 02:59:05.000
EXCLUSION. AND EXCHANGE FOR

02:59:05.067 --> 02:59:06.335
INCREASED COMMUNITY BASED AND

02:59:06.402 --> 02:59:07.703
OUTPATIENT SERVICES AND SO

02:59:07.770 --> 02:59:08.671
WHILE THE DRUG MEDI CAL

02:59:08.737 --> 02:59:11.040
ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS

02:59:11.107 --> 02:59:13.142
GROUNDBREAKING. NATIONALLY IT

02:59:13.209 --> 02:59:14.477
REFORMED OUR SUBSTANCE USE

02:59:14.543 --> 02:59:15.377
DISORDER TREATMENT AND

02:59:15.444 --> 02:59:17.513
MEDICAID. IT WAS IMPLEMENTED ON

02:59:17.580 --> 02:59:18.981
A VOLUNTARY BASIS AND THERE ARE

02:59:19.048 --> 02:59:20.015
MANY COUNTIES HAVE YET TO

02:59:20.082 --> 02:59:21.650
IMPLEMENT THEY'RE NOT HOLDING

02:59:21.717 --> 02:59:23.219
OFF BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEE THE

02:59:23.285 --> 02:59:25.187
BENEFITS TO MAKE THE SWITCH. IT

02:59:25.254 --> 02:59:27.456
REALLY IS ABOUT A KANEMI OF

02:59:27.523 --> 02:59:29.592
SCALE. IT IS ABOUT NOT HAVING

02:59:29.658 --> 02:59:31.360
SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO ESTABLISH

02:59:31.427 --> 02:59:33.162
NEW SERVICES AND THE ABILITY TO

02:59:33.229 --> 02:59:35.064
ABSORB THE DEPENDENT DEMAND FOR

02:59:35.131 --> 02:59:38.134

THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE STATE

02:59:41.170 --> 02:59:42.571

02:59:58.053 --> 03:00:00.322
IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW IS THAT

03:02:15.658 --> 03:02:17.760
DIRECTOR KELLY TALKED ABOUT. IS

03:02:17.826 --> 03:02:21.363
IN PLACE IN MANY IF NOT ALL OF

03:02:21.430 --> 03:02:24.033
OUR COMMUNITIES. IT'S THIS

03:02:24.099 --> 03:02:26.869
MUSICIANS OF INTERSECTION ALITY

03:02:26.935 --> 03:02:29.872
BETWEEN EDUCATION MENTAL HEALTH

03:02:29.938 --> 03:02:32.508
LAW ENFORCEMENT HOSPITALS- M.

03:02:32.574 --> 03:02:35.311
IT'S THESE AREAS WHERE WE'RE

03:02:35.377 --> 03:02:37.513
TRYING TO. THE STATE IS TRYING

03:02:37.579 --> 03:02:39.648
TO SUPPORT PRACTICES AND

03:02:39.715 --> 03:02:41.283
PROGRAMS AND POLICIES IN

03:02:41.350 --> 03:02:43.619
COMMUNITIES WITHOUT DICTATING

03:02:43.686 --> 03:02:45.654
ARE MANDATING HOW THEY DO IT

03:02:45.721 --> 03:02:48.290
BUT THROUGH A FACILITATION AND

03:02:48.357 --> 03:02:50.092
CAPACITY BUILDING STRATEGY THAT

03:02:50.159 --> 03:02:51.627
REALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN AND WE

03:02:51.694 --> 03:02:54.263
NEED TO DO THAT IN CONCERT WITH

03:02:54.330 --> 03:02:56.999
OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. WE WERE

03:02:57.066 --> 03:02:59.001
INVOLVED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT

03:02:59.068 --> 03:03:02.304
OF THE CALVET PROPOSAL. AND I

03:03:02.371 --> 03:03:04.406
HAD THE FORTUNE OPPORTUNITY TO

03:03:04.473 --> 03:03:05.941
TALK WITH THE REGION AT NINE

03:03:06.008 --> 03:03:07.743
ADMINISTRATOR WITH FEEDBACK.

03:03:07.810 --> 03:03:09.712
ABOUT THE STATE'S APPLICATION

03:03:09.778 --> 03:03:12.181
AND IT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT OUR

03:03:12.247 --> 03:03:14.783
OUR DISASTER PREPAREDNESS IN

03:03:14.850 --> 03:03:15.718
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS NOT AS

03:03:15.784 --> 03:03:19.321
ROBUST. AS ARE PREPARED AS IN

03:03:19.388 --> 03:03:21.590
OTHER AREAS FIRE SUPPRESSION-

03:03:21.657 --> 03:03:24.727
EVACUATIONS RIGHT WE HAVE DONE

03:03:24.793 --> 03:03:26.662
WE ARE BETTER PREPARED IN SOME

03:03:26.729 --> 03:03:28.597
OF THESE OTHER AREAS THEN WE

03:03:28.664 --> 03:03:30.966
ARE IN THE BEER HALL SPACE. AND

03:03:31.033 --> 03:03:32.334
I WOULD AG ADD THAT THAT

03:03:32.401 --> 03:03:33.802
INCLUDES SUICIDE PREVENTION

03:03:33.869 --> 03:03:36.772
WORK AND SO I THINK FOR ME THE

03:03:36.839 --> 03:03:39.007
TAKE AWAY IS THAT CALIFORNIA

03:03:39.074 --> 03:03:40.943
HAS THE RESOURCES AND THE

03:03:41.009 --> 03:03:42.945
PARTNERSHIPS AND THE EXPERTISE

03:03:43.011 --> 03:03:46.682
AND THE TOOLS. TO FUNDAMENTALLY.

03:03:46.749 --> 03:03:49.752
ADDRESS THE RISKS THAT WE FACE

03:03:49.818 --> 03:03:51.253
WHEN IT COMES TO SUICIDE

03:03:51.320 --> 03:03:54.523
PREVENTION AND ACTUALLY GET TO

03:03:54.590 --> 03:03:57.459
THIS NOTION OF ZERO- WITH THE

03:03:57.526 --> 03:03:59.595
RIGHT KIND OF COORDINATION AND

03:03:59.661 --> 03:04:01.430
ENGAGEMENT. AND THAT'S THE

03:04:01.497 --> 03:04:03.132
PIECE THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY

03:04:03.198 --> 03:04:05.367
MISSING I DON'T KNOW THAT THE

03:04:05.434 --> 03:04:08.137
ANSWER IS TO. ARM YOU KNOW

03:04:08.203 --> 03:04:10.672
CONSOLIDATE THESE STRATEGIES

03:04:10.739 --> 03:04:12.708
BECAUSE THERE ARE REASONS WHY

03:04:12.775 --> 03:04:13.308
THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

03:04:13.375 --> 03:04:15.477
SERVICES IS DOING WHAT IT'S

03:04:15.544 --> 03:04:17.679
DOING AND WE NEED TO LEVERAGE

03:04:17.746 --> 03:04:19.014
THE STRENGTHS OF EACH OF THESE

03:04:19.081 --> 03:04:21.049
PARTNERS. AND BLEND THEM IN

03:04:21.116 --> 03:04:24.253
WAYS THAT ARE IMPACTFUL ACROSS

03:04:24.319 --> 03:04:25.788
WHAT IS AN INCREDIBLY DIVERSE

03:04:25.854 --> 03:04:28.457
AND COMPLICATED STATE- YOU KNOW

03:04:28.524 --> 03:04:30.259
AND I AND I WOULD YOU KNOW LOOK

03:04:30.325 --> 03:04:34.496
NO FARTHER THAN. THE NEEDS OF

03:04:34.563 --> 03:04:35.330
OUR IN OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES.

03:04:35.397 --> 03:04:37.299
AND THE DIFFICULTY THAT WE

03:04:37.366 --> 03:04:40.569
OFTEN FIND. CONNECTING TRIBAL

03:04:40.636 --> 03:04:42.671
SERVICES WITH FEDERAL SERVICE

03:04:42.738 --> 03:04:44.406
SINCE COUNTY BASED SERVICE AND

03:04:44.473 --> 03:04:47.609
STATE SERVICE SINCE- THIS IS

03:04:47.676 --> 03:04:50.446
VERY COMPLICATED WORK THAT IF

03:04:50.512 --> 03:04:53.582
WE REALLY CAN BRING TOGETHER

03:04:53.649 --> 03:04:55.951
THE VOICES AND THE VISION OF

03:04:56.018 --> 03:04:57.853
ALL OF THESE PARTNERS WE CAN

03:04:57.920 --> 03:05:00.789
MAKE A PROFOUND IMPACT ON YOUR

03:05:00.856 --> 03:05:02.424
BUSINESS JUST AYE PREVENTION

03:05:02.491 --> 03:05:03.392
AND I THINK IT'S VERY

03:05:03.459 --> 03:05:05.594
IMPORTANT. THAT TO TAKE

03:05:05.661 --> 03:05:08.597
ADVANTAGE OF THE FACT THAT

03:05:08.664 --> 03:05:09.498
COLBERT HAS MADE MENTAL HEALTH.

03:05:09.565 --> 03:05:11.433
SOMETHING THAT ALL OF MOST OF

03:05:11.500 --> 03:05:13.335
US IF NOT ALL OF US UNDERSTAND

03:05:13.402 --> 03:05:14.837
THEIR WE HAVE SEEN DRAMATIC

03:05:14.903 --> 03:05:17.339
REDUCTIONS IN STIGMA DRAMATIC

03:05:17.406 --> 03:05:19.508
INCOME ENHANCEMENTS OF PUBLIC

03:05:19.575 --> 03:05:20.676
UNDERSTANDING OF WHY MENTAL

03:05:20.742 --> 03:05:22.544
HEALTH MATTERS ALL OF OUR WORK

03:05:22.611 --> 03:05:25.447
WITH EMPLOYERS WITH EDUCATORS-

03:05:25.514 --> 03:05:27.082
WITH WHAT YOU KNOW WE OFTEN

03:05:27.149 --> 03:05:28.517
REFERRED TO AS NONTRADITIONAL

03:05:28.584 --> 03:05:30.385
STAKEHOLDERS. WHO HAVE NOT BEEN

03:05:30.452 --> 03:05:31.753
ENGAGED IN MENTAL HEALTH

03:05:31.820 --> 03:05:33.722
THEY'RE RECEPTIVE ATTY TO THIS

03:05:33.789 --> 03:05:35.824
CONVERSATION TODAY IS

03:05:35.891 --> 03:05:38.393
TREMENDOUSLY GREATER THAN IT

03:05:38.460 --> 03:05:40.729
WAS PRE PANDEMIC. IT'S

03:05:40.796 --> 03:05:42.865
INCUMBENT ON CALIFORNIA TO TAKE

03:05:42.931 --> 03:05:44.633
ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY

03:05:44.700 --> 03:05:46.068
WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS BUT THE

03:05:46.134 --> 03:05:48.270
LEADERSHIP IN PLACE AND REALLY

03:05:48.337 --> 03:05:51.206
WORK ACROSS THE MANY STATE AND

03:05:51.273 --> 03:05:53.442
LOCAL AGENCIES INCLUDING SOME

03:05:53.509 --> 03:05:56.378
OF OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS. TO

03:05:56.445 --> 03:05:58.280
DEPLOYED A STRATEGY THAT WE'VE

03:05:58.347 --> 03:06:01.383
IDENTIFIED IN WAYS THAT WE CAN

03:06:01.450 --> 03:06:03.285
GET TO ZERO. THANK YOU TO OPT

03:06:03.352 --> 03:06:04.486
IS YOUR QUESTION NO IT DOES

03:06:04.553 --> 03:06:07.189
AND- I THINK WE'VE HEARD DR

03:06:07.256 --> 03:06:09.625
GOLLY SAY THAT COULD BE

03:06:09.691 --> 03:06:10.592
NINETEEN SHOULD BE AN EXCEL

03:06:10.659 --> 03:06:12.394
AROUND FOR MUCH CHANGE AND

03:06:12.461 --> 03:06:15.030
REALLY WOULD. HOPE THAT DURING

03:06:15.097 --> 03:06:18.200
THIS PANDEMIC WE CAN SEE. THE

03:06:18.267 --> 03:06:19.668
ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITHIN

03:06:19.735 --> 03:06:21.370
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUICIDES

03:06:21.436 --> 03:06:22.604
IN TERMS OF OUR DISASTER

03:06:22.671 --> 03:06:24.506
PREPAREDNESS AND THE REAL NEED

03:06:24.573 --> 03:06:26.808
FOR US TO HAVE. COLLABORATION

03:06:26.875 --> 03:06:29.478
AND SO IF I COULD I WOULD LIKE

03:06:29.545 --> 03:06:31.346
TO ASK A POINTED QUESTION FOR

03:06:31.413 --> 03:06:33.248
THE ADMINISTRATION BUT IT.

03:06:33.315 --> 03:06:35.183
REALLY IS BASED ON THE FACT

03:06:35.250 --> 03:06:38.287
THAT SUICIDES AND- OVERDOSE

03:06:38.353 --> 03:06:41.189
DEATHS ARE DEATHS OF DESPAIR.

03:06:41.256 --> 03:06:42.691
AND BECAUSE OF THAT I REALLY

03:06:42.758 --> 03:06:44.760
FEEL THAT IT BEGGING FOR REAL

03:06:44.826 --> 03:06:47.296
STRONG LEADERSHIP. IN OUR STATE

03:06:47.362 --> 03:06:49.097
CAPITOL AND I'M HPING THAT THE

03:06:49.164 --> 03:06:52.167
ADMINISTRATION CAN DESCRIBE HOW

03:06:52.234 --> 03:06:54.336
IT PLANS TO PROVIDE INCREASED

03:06:54.403 --> 03:06:56.104
COORDINATION AND POWERFUL

03:06:56.171 --> 03:06:59.074
LEADERSHIP IN GENERAL ON THESE

03:06:59.141 --> 03:07:06.081
ISSUES. THE QUESTION IS FOR

03:07:06.148 --> 03:07:07.482
EITHER DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

03:07:07.549 --> 03:07:09.184
CARE SERVICES OR THE DEPARTMENT

03:07:09.251 --> 03:07:13.221

DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WAS

STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

LEVERAGING ALL SERVICES THAT

03:07:28.537 --> 03:07:29.972
ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO REDUCE

03:07:30.038 --> 03:07:32.975

SPEAKERS WE'VE BEEN TRACKING

03:07:48.123 --> 03:07:49.891
THIS YOU KNOW FOR QUITE SOME

03:07:49.958 --> 03:07:51.460
TIME WE HAVEN'T HAD OBVIOUSLY

03:07:51.526 --> 03:07:53.295
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE

03:07:53.362 --> 03:07:55.163
DEPARTMENT THAT WE'VE WAITED A

03:07:55.230 --> 03:07:56.665
PRIORITY IN TERMS OF OUR

03:07:56.732 --> 03:07:59.101
SURVEILLANCE- IN TERMS OF THEIR

03:07:59.167 --> 03:08:01.336
REPORTING THAT WE TRYING TO DO

03:08:01.403 --> 03:08:02.771
TO REALLY AT LEAST BRING THE

03:08:02.838 --> 03:08:04.206
AWARENESS UP OVER THE PAST

03:08:04.272 --> 03:08:06.308
COUPLE OF YEARS WE'VE ORGANIZED

03:08:06.375 --> 03:08:07.743
INTERNALLY IN OUR DEPARTMENT

03:08:07.809 --> 03:08:10.245
ACROSS PROGRAMS. AND FOR US

03:08:10.312 --> 03:08:11.780
IT'S A HEALTHY COMMUNITIES

03:08:11.847 --> 03:08:13.715
APPROACH AS A WHOLE BECAUSE

03:08:13.782 --> 03:08:15.517
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU

03:08:15.584 --> 03:08:16.818
KNOW MENTAL HEALTH YOU ALSO

03:08:16.885 --> 03:08:18.553
HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE

03:08:18.620 --> 03:08:20.122
RISK FACTORS SUCH AS HOW TO

03:08:20.188 --> 03:08:21.390
BACK WHO PLAYS A ROLE WE NEED

03:08:21.456 --> 03:08:22.524
TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HOW THIS

03:08:22.591 --> 03:08:24.526
IMPACTS CHRONIC DISEASES AND SO

03:08:24.593 --> 03:08:26.028
THESE ARE THE DISCUSSIONS THAT

03:08:26.094 --> 03:08:27.562
HAVE BEEN TAKING CE

03:08:27.629 --> 03:08:29.931
DEPARTMENT BUT IT DOES MAKE A

03:08:29.998 --> 03:08:31.767
DIFFERENCE TO HAVE THE BACKBONE

03:08:31.833 --> 03:08:33.869
AT THE OFFICE OF SUICIDE.

03:08:33.935 --> 03:08:35.904
PREVENTION PLAN IS OUTLINING IN

03:08:35.971 --> 03:08:38.607

03:08:47.349 --> 03:08:48.817
PREVIOUS SPEAKERS HAVE STATED

03:08:48.884 --> 03:08:50.352
TO REALLY MAKE AN INTENTIONAL

03:08:50.419 --> 03:08:52.621
ALIGNMENT ACROSS THE DIFFERENT

03:08:52.688 --> 03:08:57.559
SYSTEMS AND IN PROVIDING A-STRONG STRONG LEADERSHIP ROLE

03:08:57.626 --> 03:08:59.027
TO REALLY GET THIS GOING IT'S

03:08:59.094 --> 03:09:00.562
NOT FOR THE LACK OF WORK THAT'S

03:09:00.629 --> 03:09:02.264
TAKING PLCE. THEY DIDN'T

03:09:02.330 --> 03:09:04.700
EMBRACE IN THAT VISION THAT THE

03:53:46.078 --> 03:53:48.581
SERVE PEOPLE VERY EARLY AND THE

03:53:48.647 --> 03:53:50.616
ONSET OF PSYCHOSIS SO THAT

03:53:50.683 --> 03:53:52.551
THEIR NEEDS DON'T ESCALATE TO

03:53:52.618 --> 03:53:53.886
THE POINT. THAT THEY ARE

03:53:53.953 --> 03:53:56.455
ARRESTED FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE

03:53:56.522 --> 03:53:57.523
TIMES FOR MISDEMEANORS AND THEN

03:53:57.590 --> 03:53:59.525
HAVE A FELONY CHARGE AND BECOME

03:53:59.592 --> 03:54:01.894
INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. HOW

03:54:01.961 --> 03:54:05.030
CAN WE STRENGTHEN THE FOR THE

03:54:05.097 --> 03:54:05.898
FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP MODEL.

03:54:05.965 --> 03:54:08.100
AND I WOULD COMMENT THAT IT'S

03:54:08.167 --> 03:54:08.567
CALLED A FULL SERVICE

03:54:08.634 --> 03:54:10.236
PARTNERSHIP MODEL. THE WORD

03:54:10.302 --> 03:54:11.837
PARTNER REFERS TO THE

03:54:11.904 --> 03:54:13.539
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE

03:54:13.606 --> 03:54:14.740
INDIVIDUAL AND THE COMMUNITY

03:54:14.807 --> 03:54:16.308
BASED ORGANIZATION OR THE

03:54:16.375 --> 03:54:18.244
COUNTY THAT IS DELIVERING CARE

03:54:18.310 --> 03:54:20.279
AND IT'S FULL SERVICE BECAUSE

03:54:20.346 --> 03:54:21.347
THE FLEXIBILITY OF MENTAL

03:54:21.414 --> 03:54:22.782
HEALTH SERVICES ACT FARMS

03:54:22.848 --> 03:54:24.617
ALLOWS THE PROVIDER TO DO

03:54:24.683 --> 03:54:26.752
WHATEVER IT TAKES. IN ORDER TO

03:54:26.819 --> 03:54:28.154
ENSURE THAT THAT PERSON HAS THE

03:54:28.220 --> 03:54:31.123
CARE AND THE SUPPORT NECESSARY

03:54:31.190 --> 03:54:33.025
SO THAT THEY AREN'T HOMELESS

03:54:33.092 --> 03:54:33.893
AREN'T INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL

03:54:33.959 --> 03:54:35.995
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND AREN'T

03:54:36.061 --> 03:54:39.432
INVOLVED WITH- ESTATE HOSPITALS

03:54:39.498 --> 03:54:41.467
OR OR EVEN COMMUNITY HOSPITALS.

03:54:41.534 --> 03:54:44.036
THAT COMMENT IN THE ANALYSIS

03:54:44.103 --> 03:54:44.670
ABOUT THE LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT

03:54:44.737 --> 03:54:47.006
IS AVAILABLE. THE FULL SERVICE

03:54:47.072 --> 03:54:48.941
PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM WAS FOUND

03:54:49.008 --> 03:54:50.843
TO BE SO EFFECTIVE IN THE

03:54:50.910 --> 03:54:52.711
INITIAL EVALUATIONS THAT WERE

03:54:52.778 --> 03:54:55.848
CONDUCTED. AS THE MENTAL HEALTH

03:54:55.915 --> 03:54:56.482
SERVICES ACT WAS ACTUALLY BEING

03:54:56.549 --> 03:54:58.984
DRAFTED. THAT THE AXE THAT

03:54:59.051 --> 03:55:00.820
STIPULATES THAT COUNTIES ARE

03:55:00.886 --> 03:55:03.088
REQUIRED TO SPEND AT LEAST HALF

03:55:03.155 --> 03:55:04.690
OF THEIR COMMUNITY SERVICES AND

03:55:04.757 --> 03:55:06.192
SUPPORT FUNDS ON FULL SERVICE

03:55:06.258 --> 03:55:08.427
PARTNERSHIPS. AND AS INDICATED

03:55:08.494 --> 03:55:11.297
IN THE ANALYSIS. THAT'S RUNNING

03:55:11.363 --> 03:55:12.832
AROUND NINE HUNDRED MILLION

03:55:12.898 --> 03:55:14.533
DOLLARS A YEAR AND THE REASON I

03:55:14.600 --> 03:55:17.403
MENTION THIS IS BECAUSE THAT IS

03:55:17.470 --> 03:55:20.606
YEAH. AMONG IF NOT THE LARGEST

03:55:20.673 --> 03:55:22.975
INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMMATIC

03:55:23.042 --> 03:55:23.776
INVESTMENT THAT WE MAKE. IT

03:55:23.843 --> 03:55:25.211
MEANS THERE'S A TREMENDOUS

03:55:25.277 --> 03:55:27.980
OPPORTUNITY. IF THE STATE CAN

03:55:28.047 --> 03:55:29.915
SUPPORT IT BILLION COUNTIES TO

03:55:29.982 --> 03:55:31.717
UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

03:55:31.784 --> 03:55:33.452
THOSE INVESTMENTS HOW WE MIGHT

03:55:33.519 --> 03:55:35.187
STRENGTHEN THOSE INVESTMENTS

03:55:35.254 --> 03:55:37.690
AND HOW WE MIGHT FIND WAYS TO

03:55:37.756 --> 03:55:39.925
EXPAND OF THOSE INVESTMENTS. AS

03:55:39.992 --> 03:55:41.727
AN EXPLICIT STRATEGY TO TAKE

03:55:41.794 --> 03:55:44.530
PRESSURE OFF OF OUR HOSPITAL

03:55:44.597 --> 03:55:47.399
SYSTEM THE GOAL IS TO REDUCE

03:55:47.466 --> 03:55:49.468
RELIANCE ON INSTITUTIONAL CARE

03:55:49.535 --> 03:55:51.770
RATHER THAN EXPAND RELIANCE ON

03:55:51.837 --> 03:55:53.839
INSTITUTIONAL CARE. YEAH AND

03:55:53.906 --> 03:55:55.608
WE'RE CONCERNED THAT WE'VE NOT

03:55:55.674 --> 03:55:57.576
NECESSARILY MADE THE RIGHT KIND

03:55:57.643 --> 03:55:59.278
OF INVESTMENTS IN PARTNERSHIP

03:55:59.345 --> 03:56:02.181
WITH COUNTIES. TO EXPLORE HOW

03:56:02.248 --> 03:56:05.251
THAT CAN WORK THAT INCLUDES

03:56:05.317 --> 03:56:06.285
THINGS LIKE. BETTER

03:56:06.352 --> 03:56:08.053
UNDERSTANDING OF WHO IS

03:56:08.120 --> 03:56:10.256
DEVELOPING PSYCHOSIS AND

03:56:10.322 --> 03:56:12.558
ENSURING THAT WE ARE DELIVERING

03:56:12.625 --> 03:56:14.226
CARE AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE.

03:56:14.293 --> 03:56:15.528
I'M ON AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE

03:56:15.594 --> 03:56:17.329
FOR THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS

03:56:17.396 --> 03:56:18.464
AS THEY'RE TRYING TO DEVELOP

03:56:18.531 --> 03:56:20.065
OUT THERE EARLY SIZED PSYCHOSIS

03:56:20.132 --> 03:56:22.201
PROGRAM AND THEY'RE EXPLICITLY

03:56:22.268 --> 03:56:24.103
TO FRACKING BASED ON PREVALENCE

03:56:24.169 --> 03:56:26.071
RATES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO

03:56:26.138 --> 03:56:28.207
RESEARCH SUGGESTS WILL DEVELOP

03:56:28.274 --> 03:56:30.276
A PSYCHOTIC DISORDER. IN THE

03:56:30.342 --> 03:56:31.610
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO COME IN

03:56:31.677 --> 03:56:33.012
FOR SERVICES AND THEN ARE

03:56:33.078 --> 03:56:34.513
WORKING VERY AGGRESSIVELY TO

03:56:34.580 --> 03:56:36.882
SEE IF THEY CAN IDENTIFY THE

03:56:36.949 --> 03:56:38.717
80% OR SO OF PEOPLE THAN THEIR

03:56:38.784 --> 03:56:40.185
STATE WHO ARE NOT ACCESSING

03:56:40.252 --> 03:56:44.557
CARE WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR OF

03:56:44.623 --> 03:56:45.758
ON SET OF. A PSYCHOTIC DISORDER.

03:56:45.824 --> 03:56:47.793
WE'RE BEGINNING TO TRACK.

03:56:47.860 --> 03:56:49.194
WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE WHO DO

03:56:49.261 --> 03:56:50.930
HAVE A PSYCHOTIC DISORDER ARE

03:56:50.996 --> 03:56:53.098
ACCESSING FOSTERS PARTNERSHIPS

03:56:53.165 --> 03:56:55.000
SERVICES WE'RE ALSO BEGINNING

03:56:55.067 --> 03:56:57.069
TO TRACK THE IMPACT OF.

03:56:57.136 --> 03:56:58.137
RECEIVING SERVICES THAT THESE

03:56:58.203 --> 03:57:00.472
PROGRAMS AND WE CAN SHARE WITH

03:57:00.539 --> 03:57:03.208
YOU THAT AS MUCH AS SIXTY NINE

03:57:03.275 --> 03:57:05.144
THERE'S A IS MUCH OF THE 69%

03:57:05.210 --> 03:57:07.813
REDUCTION. IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE

03:57:07.880 --> 03:57:09.615
INVOLVEMENT. ALL WHO ARE SERVED

03:57:09.682 --> 03:57:11.250
BY A FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP

03:57:11.317 --> 03:57:14.320
SO WE THINK THIS STRATEGY OF

03:57:14.386 --> 03:57:15.888
DELIVERING MORE COMMUNITY BASED

03:57:15.955 --> 03:57:19.858
CARE. WRAPAROUND CARE CARE THAT

03:57:19.925 --> 03:57:21.627
IS TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF

03:57:21.694 --> 03:57:23.395
INDIVIDUALS THAT IT THAT

03:57:23.462 --> 03:57:25.331
SUPPORTS OUR ABILITY TO MOVE

03:57:25.397 --> 03:57:27.666
UPSTREAM. IS THE WAY THAT WE

03:57:27.733 --> 03:57:29.335
CAN AFFORDABLE THEY REDUCE

03:57:29.401 --> 03:57:32.204
RELIANCE ON VERY EXPENSIVE VERY

03:57:32.271 --> 03:57:34.807
DIFFICULT. INSTITUTIONAL KINDS

03:57:34.873 --> 03:57:36.075
OF SETTINGS NOW THAT DOESN'T

03:57:36.141 --> 03:57:37.910
MEAN THAT WE CAN TAKE PEOPLE

03:57:37.977 --> 03:57:40.646
TODAY OUT OF INSTITUTIONS BUT

03:57:40.713 --> 03:57:42.615
IT DOES MEAN THAT WE CAN BEGIN

03:57:42.681 --> 03:57:44.450
TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN

03:57:44.516 --> 03:57:44.883
PREVENTION AND EARLY

03:57:44.950 --> 03:57:47.086
INTERVENTION SO THAT OVER TIME

03:57:47.152 --> 03:57:49.254
WE'RE LESS RELIANT. ON STATE

03:57:49.321 --> 03:57:51.824
HOSPITAL BEDS WERE LESS RELIANT

03:57:51.890 --> 03:57:53.892
ON THESE CRISIS SERVICES AND

03:57:53.959 --> 03:57:55.828
ARGUABLY WERE EVEN LESS RESIGN

03:57:55.894 --> 03:57:56.562
RELIANT ON FULL SERVICE

03:57:56.629 --> 03:57:58.664
PARTNERSHIPS BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN

03:57:58.731 --> 03:58:00.666
ABLE TO DO PREVENTION AND EARLY

03:58:00.733 --> 03:58:02.735
INTERVENTION A FAR BETTER THAN

03:58:02.801 --> 03:58:05.638
WE'RE DOING TODAY. THE M. AND I

03:58:05.704 --> 03:58:07.439
MENTIONED THE MONEY AGAIN

03:58:07.506 --> 03:58:10.075
BECAUSE GIVEN THE SCALE OF THE

03:58:10.142 --> 03:58:11.677
STATE'S INVESTMENT IN FOR

03:58:11.744 --> 03:58:13.479
SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS IT'S

03:58:13.545 --> 03:58:15.147
IMPORTANT THAT WE BEGIN TO LOOK

03:58:15.214 --> 03:58:16.448
AT THE IMPACT OF THOSE

03:58:16.515 --> 03:58:17.883
INVESTMENTS AND HOW WE MIGHT

03:58:17.950 --> 03:58:20.152
LEVERAGE THAT. MAXIMIZING

03:58:20.219 --> 03:58:22.254
FEDERAL DRIVE DOWN FOR EXAMPLE

03:58:22.321 --> 03:58:24.857
I'M- ALSO PROVIDING THE RIGHT

03:58:24.923 --> 03:58:26.358
KIND OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

03:58:26.425 --> 03:58:28.127
RESEARCH ANALYSIS AND SUPPORT

03:58:28.193 --> 03:58:29.862
TO OUR COUNTY PARTNERS SO WE

03:58:29.928 --> 03:58:30.863
CAN MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING THE

03:58:30.929 --> 03:58:34.633
BIGGEST. BANG FOR THE BUCK THAT

03:58:34.700 --> 03:58:35.968
IS POSSIBLE. THE QUESTION IF

03:58:36.035 --> 03:58:37.302
YOU HAVE THEM THANK YOU NEXT

03:58:37.369 --> 03:58:43.942

SAFETY NET REALLY SPECIALIZES

03:58:50.582 --> 03:58:52.084
IN WORKING WITH OUR HIGH NEEDS

03:58:52.151 --> 03:58:53.152
POPULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

PERSISTENT MENTAL ILLNESS AND

03:58:58.857 --> 03:59:00.993
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. AS WELL

03:59:01.060 --> 03:59:02.261
AS THOSE WHO ARE JUSTICE

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES WE

03:59:07.966 --> 03:59:09.401
WORK REALLY WELL WITH THESE

03:59:09.468 --> 03:59:11.737
POPULATIONS BECAUSE WE TAKE A

SYSTEMS APPROACH A

03:59:13.205 --> 03:59:14.273
BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL APPROACH TO

LOCKED IN OTHER TREATMENT

03:59:23.949 --> 03:59:25.751
SERVICES WHICH ALL TOO OFTEN

03:59:25.818 --> 03:59:27.720
FALL OUTSIDE OF THE ROUNDOF

03:59:27.786 --> 03:59:29.555
REGULAR HEALTH CARE INSURANCE

03:59:29.621 --> 03:59:33.459

MEDICARE. THE SILO FUNDING

03:59:34.993 --> 03:59:35.994

03:59:36.061 --> 03:59:38.030
DIFFICULT FOR STAKEHOLDERS AND

03:59:38.097 --> 03:59:40.699
POLICY MAKERS TO GET THE FULL

PICTURE OF OUR RANGE OF

03:59:41.266 --> 03:59:45.604
SERVICES- AND TO BE ABLE TO SEE

03:59:45.671 --> 03:59:48.240
WHERE ACTUAL GAPS EXIST IT IS

03:59:48.307 --> 03:59:49.675
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WITH THE

03:59:49.742 --> 03:59:51.643
BROADER HOMELESS POPULATION

03:59:51.710 --> 03:59:54.446
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 2225% OF

INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING

03:59:56.448 --> 03:59:58.817
HOMELESSNESS HAVE A SERIOUS

03:59:58.884 --> 04:00:01.186
RELATIVELY SMALL BUT AN ACUTE

04:00:01.253 --> 04:00:01.653
PORTION OF THE BROADER

04:00:01.720 --> 04:00:03.756
POPULATION SAME FOR SUBSTANCE

04:00:03.822 --> 04:00:06.725
USE DISORDER RATES ARE CLOSER

04:00:06.792 --> 04:00:09.194
217220% ACCORDING TO THE- THE

DEVELOP BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

04:00:20.105 --> 04:00:22.074
CONDITIONS AS A RESULT. OF

04:00:22.141 --> 04:00:24.409
THEIR HOMELESSNESS NOT THE

04:00:24.476 --> 04:00:25.844
OTHER WAY AROUND HOW LONG

04:00:25.911 --> 04:00:26.945
PERIODS OF LIVING ON THE

04:00:27.012 --> 04:00:28.680
STREETS CAN EXPOSE INDIVIDUALS

04:00:28.747 --> 04:00:30.849
TO MULTIPLE LAYERS OF TRAUMAS

04:00:30.916 --> 04:00:31.917
AND THE EXPERIENCE OF LIVING

04:00:31.984 --> 04:00:33.218
WITH THE STIGMA AND BIAS THAT

04:00:33.285 --> 04:00:34.753
ALSO COMES ALONG WITH A HERO

04:00:34.820 --> 04:00:36.321
CAL HEALTH CONDITIONS CAN

04:00:36.388 --> 04:00:38.524
ABSOLUTELY MAKE OUR CLIENTS

04:00:38.590 --> 04:00:41.260
MORE VULNERABLE TO EXPERIENCING

04:00:41.326 --> 04:00:42.161
HOMELESSNESS. I LIKE TO JUST

04:00:42.227 --> 04:00:44.062
SHARE SOME OF OUR SUCCESSES IN

04:00:44.129 --> 04:00:44.930
WORKING WITH THE CRIMINAL

CONTINUATION OF THESE PROGRAMS

04:21:32.543 --> 04:21:34.078
BUT INSTEAD. REPRESENTS A

04:21:34.145 --> 04:21:35.513
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE

04:21:35.579 --> 04:21:37.381
STATE'S APPROACH TO FINANCING

04:22:01.205 --> 04:22:02.840
WE ALSO FIND THAT CALTRAIN HAS

04:22:02.907 --> 04:22:04.375
THE POTENTIAL TO BRING MAJOR

MYSELF. I'M I WILL FOCUS ON

04:24:36.560 --> 04:24:38.028
THREE QUESTIONS FIRST I AM

04:24:38.095 --> 04:24:40.431
GOING TO- WANTS TO DISCUSS THE

04:24:40.497 --> 04:24:42.266
FELONY ISD'S. I WANT TO GET AN

04:24:42.333 --> 04:24:44.201
UNDERSTANDING OF HISTORICALLY

04:24:44.268 --> 04:24:45.669
WHY THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

04:24:45.736 --> 04:24:48.205
BETWEEN A MISDEMEANOR I S. T.

04:24:48.272 --> 04:24:51.609
AND A FELONY I S. T. AND WHY WE

04:24:51.675 --> 04:24:55.446
DON'T HAVE PARITY IN THAT SPACE.

04:24:55.512 --> 04:24:58.415
IS ANYONE OUT ABLE TO EXPLAIN

04:24:58.482 --> 04:24:58.949
WHY THERE IS A DIFFERENCE

04:24:59.016 --> 04:25:04.021
BETWEEN THOSE TWO. EXPLANATION

04:25:04.088 --> 04:25:05.756
JUST THAT IT IT HAS BEEN

04:25:05.823 --> 04:25:09.059
HISTORICALLY- THE MAN THE

04:25:09.126 --> 04:25:10.561
MISDEMEANOR I IS HE'S BEEN WITH

04:25:10.628 --> 04:25:14.098
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE- I

04:25:14.164 --> 04:25:16.400
COUNTIES AND THE FELONY IDEAS

04:25:16.467 --> 04:25:18.302
TO USE IN THE TREATMENT HAS

04:25:18.369 --> 04:25:20.971
HISTORICALLY BEEN THE-

04:25:21.038 --> 04:25:23.741
RESPONSIBILITY OF STATE. WHY

04:25:23.807 --> 04:25:31.548
THAT IS I DON'T KNOW. THEN IN

04:25:31.615 --> 04:25:33.550
THAT LIGHT I'D LIKE TO RETURN

04:25:33.617 --> 04:25:35.219
TO TOBY EWING IF I COULD

04:25:35.286 --> 04:25:37.087
REGARDING- THE FULL SERVICE

04:25:37.154 --> 04:25:40.357
PARTNERSHIPS- DURING THE

04:25:40.424 --> 04:25:41.892
DESCRIPTION OR THE RIGHT UP IT

04:25:41.959 --> 04:25:44.094
SAYS THAT THESE HEALTH SERVICES

04:25:44.161 --> 04:25:46.664
ARE FOR THE UNDERSERVED FOR- OR

04:25:46.730 --> 04:25:47.831
PREVIOUSLY UNDERSERVED

04:25:47.898 --> 04:25:49.166
INDIVIDUALS IN THE PUBLIC

04:25:49.233 --> 04:25:50.834
MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM WITH VERY

04:25:50.901 --> 04:25:53.070
HIGH NEEDS AND WITH SERIOUS AND

04:25:53.137 --> 04:25:55.105
SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS I BELIEVE

04:25:55.172 --> 04:25:56.907
THAT WOULD ENCAPSULATE THE

04:25:56.974 --> 04:25:59.209
FELONY I S. T. IS AND- WANTS TO

04:25:59.276 --> 04:26:01.278
GET YOUR UNDERSTANDING WHY YOU

04:26:01.345 --> 04:26:02.212
BELIEVE THAT THEY'VE BEEN

04:26:02.279 --> 04:26:05.049
EXCLUDED THUS FAR FROM THE FULL

04:26:05.115 --> 04:26:10.921
SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS. MISTER

04:26:10.988 --> 04:26:17.561
EWING. PARDON ME I DIDN'T HAVE

04:26:17.628 --> 04:26:18.162
J. C. TO TELL ME THAT I'M YET

04:26:18.228 --> 04:26:22.800
MY- SO- SO APOLOGIES FOR THAT

04:26:22.866 --> 04:26:26.337
I'M- SO TO CLARIFY THE FULL

04:26:26.403 --> 04:26:27.504
SERVICE PARTNERSHIP IS THE

04:26:27.571 --> 04:26:31.075
COMMUNITY BASED CARE AND THE M.

04:26:31.141 --> 04:26:32.509
BECAUSE THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE

04:26:32.576 --> 04:26:35.312
BEEN ARRESTED AND CHARGED WITH

04:26:35.379 --> 04:26:36.947
A CRIME THE STATE THIS IS MY

04:26:37.014 --> 04:26:38.082
UNDERSTANDING AND THERE ARE

04:26:38.148 --> 04:26:39.550
OTHERS HERE ON THE PANEL OF OUR

04:26:39.616 --> 04:26:41.018
EXPERTISE IN THIS AREA AND I AM

04:26:41.085 --> 04:26:43.187
ON THE DETAILS. NO THEY ARE

04:26:43.253 --> 04:26:45.022
DIRECTED TO THE DEPARTMENT

04:26:45.089 --> 04:26:47.057
STATE HOSPITALS FOR TREATMENT

04:26:47.124 --> 04:26:50.227
SO THAT THEIR COMPETENCY CAN BE

04:26:50.294 --> 04:26:52.096
CAN BE RESTORED. IN CONTRAST MY

04:26:52.162 --> 04:26:53.163
COMMENTS ARE ON THE FOSTERS

04:26:53.230 --> 04:26:55.899
PARTNERSHIP IS THAT NO PRIOR.

04:26:55.966 --> 04:26:58.702
TO THE FELONY ARREST. M. AND

04:26:58.769 --> 04:26:59.970
YOU KNOW PRIOR TO MISDEMEANOR

04:27:00.037 --> 04:27:01.505
ARRESTS THE FULL SERVICE

04:27:01.572 --> 04:27:04.908
PARTNERSHIP OPTION. IS HOW WE

04:27:04.975 --> 04:27:07.945
DESIGN CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE

04:27:08.011 --> 04:27:09.780
THESE VERY HIGH LEVELS OF NEED.

04:27:09.847 --> 04:27:12.182
AND WHAT IS. SHOCKING IN SOME

04:27:12.249 --> 04:27:14.918
WAYS IS LARGE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE

04:27:14.985 --> 04:27:16.987
WHO ARE VERY WELL KNOWN TO OUR

04:27:17.054 --> 04:27:18.689
COMMUNITY SYSTEMS BECAUSE OF

04:27:18.756 --> 04:27:19.523
THE NUMBER OF ARRESTS THAT

04:27:19.590 --> 04:27:21.291
THEY'VE EXPERIENCED. THAT IS

04:27:21.358 --> 04:27:22.626
OUTLINED IN THE WORK THAT THE

04:27:22.693 --> 04:27:24.661
PROPER STATE HOSPITAL HAS HAS

04:27:24.728 --> 04:27:26.830
SHARED IN THE PAST- THEY'RE NOT

04:27:26.897 --> 04:27:28.632
NECESSARILY RECEIVING THE FULL

04:27:28.699 --> 04:27:30.167
ARRAY OF COMMUNITY BASED CARE.

04:27:30.234 --> 04:27:31.602
SO THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP

04:27:31.668 --> 04:27:32.469
ACTUALLY REPRESENTS AN

04:27:32.536 --> 04:27:34.972
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE PRESSURE

04:27:35.038 --> 04:27:36.640
OFF OF THESE SYSTEMS THE

04:27:36.707 --> 04:27:38.809
QUESTIONS WE HAVE IS HOW CAN WE

04:27:38.876 --> 04:27:40.744
BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEMS

04:27:40.811 --> 04:27:43.180
HOW CAN WE SUPPORT. THOSE

04:27:43.247 --> 04:27:44.114
STRATEGIES ON THE PART OF

04:27:44.181 --> 04:27:46.550
COUNTIES. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

04:27:46.617 --> 04:27:48.285
ARE DELIVERING FULL SERVICE

04:27:48.352 --> 04:27:50.821
CARE SERVICES IN WAYS THAT ARE

04:27:50.888 --> 04:27:52.523
COST EFFECTIVE. AND THESE

04:27:52.589 --> 04:27:54.525
BECOME PREVENTION AND EARLY

04:27:54.591 --> 04:27:56.360
INTERVENTION STRATEGIES FOR

04:27:56.427 --> 04:27:57.361
PEOPLE WHO OTHERWISE ARE

04:27:57.428 --> 04:27:59.863
CYCLING THROUGH HOSPITALS JAILS

04:27:59.930 --> 04:28:01.899
AND THE STREETS. M. WE

04:28:01.965 --> 04:28:03.901
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

04:28:03.967 --> 04:28:04.768
MONEY AVAILABLE FOR FAR FOR

04:28:04.835 --> 04:28:06.537
FOSTERS PARTNERSHIPS IT MAY NOT

04:28:06.603 --> 04:28:08.539
BE ENOUGH. THE QUESTION FOR THE

04:28:08.605 --> 04:28:09.973
STATE REALLY SHOULD LOOK AT

04:28:10.040 --> 04:28:11.041
WHETHER THE FULL SERVICE

04:28:11.108 --> 04:28:13.010
PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITY IS A

04:28:13.076 --> 04:28:15.679
BETTER ALTERNATIVE. BOTH IN

04:28:15.746 --> 04:28:17.815
TERMS OF THEIR ABILITY TO

04:28:17.881 --> 04:28:18.482
PROVIDE CARE IN A VOLUNTARY

04:28:18.549 --> 04:28:20.384
MANNER. KEEPING PEOPLE AND

04:28:20.451 --> 04:28:22.586
COMMUNITIES KEEPING PEOPLE IN

04:28:22.653 --> 04:28:23.954
SERVICES FOR WHICH THEY'RE

04:28:24.021 --> 04:28:26.557
ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL MATCHING

04:28:26.623 --> 04:28:28.091
OFTENTIMES NOT ALWAYS BE

04:28:28.158 --> 04:28:29.193
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE

04:28:29.259 --> 04:28:31.128
SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED. ANY

04:28:31.195 --> 04:28:35.833
IF THEY ACTUALLY. LOWER OUR

04:28:35.899 --> 04:28:36.467
LONG TERM COSTS. N ADDITION TO

04:28:36.533 --> 04:28:37.501
THAT WITH OUR THAT THE STATE

04:28:37.568 --> 04:28:39.203
ALSO NEEDS TO BE THINKING EVEN

04:28:39.269 --> 04:28:42.506
FARTHER UPSTREAM. HOW CAN WE

04:28:42.573 --> 04:28:45.008
DELIVER CARE THROUGH PREVENTION

04:28:45.075 --> 04:28:46.477
AND EARLY INTERVENTION SO WE

04:28:46.543 --> 04:28:49.146
DON'T EVEN NEED AS MANY FULL

04:28:49.213 --> 04:28:51.582
SERVICE PARTNERSHIP SLOTS. I'M

04:28:51.648 --> 04:28:52.916
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE

04:28:52.983 --> 04:28:53.884
FINDING IN TALKING TO OTHER

04:28:53.951 --> 04:28:55.652
STATES YES THEY'RE TYING

04:28:55.719 --> 04:28:58.722
TOGETHER THEIR EFFORTS TO

04:28:58.789 --> 04:29:00.624
SUPPORT PEOPLE VERY EARLY IN

04:29:00.691 --> 04:29:02.025
THE DEVELOPMENT OF US SERIOUS

04:29:02.092 --> 04:29:03.694
MENTAL ILLNESS. WITH THEIR

04:29:03.760 --> 04:29:04.161
SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH

04:29:04.228 --> 04:29:06.063
INITIATIVES OTHER STATES ARE

04:29:06.129 --> 04:29:08.532
ARGUING THAT BECAUSE PSYCHOSIS

04:29:08.599 --> 04:29:10.234
TENDS TO START IN THE TEEN

04:29:10.300 --> 04:29:12.669
YEARS FIFTEEN TWENTY FIVE. THAT

04:29:12.736 --> 04:29:14.538
SCHOOLS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT

04:29:14.605 --> 04:29:17.441
GATEWAYS TO ACCESS TO

04:29:17.508 --> 04:29:19.076
SUPPORTING PEOPLE TO ENTER INTO

04:29:19.142 --> 04:29:22.079
SERVICES SO THEY DON'T BECOME.

04:29:22.145 --> 04:29:23.080
SEVERELY AND PERSISTENTLY

04:29:23.146 --> 04:29:24.681
MENTALLY ILL MENTALLY ILL AND

04:29:24.748 --> 04:29:27.618
HOMELESS AND INVEST BECOME AT

04:29:27.684 --> 04:29:30.554
HIGH RISK FOR MULTIPLE ARRESTS

04:29:30.621 --> 04:29:33.090
AT HIGH RISK FOR FELONY CHARGES

04:29:33.156 --> 04:29:34.658
AND IT HIGHER BEST HIGH RISK

04:29:34.725 --> 04:29:37.794
OR- STATE HOSPITALIZATION. IT'S

04:29:37.861 --> 04:29:39.663
NOT THE FOLKS THAT ARE INVOLVED

04:29:39.730 --> 04:29:40.631

PARTNERSHIP WE- THEY MAY BE

04:29:45.469 --> 04:29:48.939
PRIOR TO THEIR ARREST. IN ONE

04:29:49.006 --> 04:29:49.540
OF THE QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO

04:29:49.606 --> 04:29:50.674
UNDERSTAND IS ARE THOSE

04:29:50.741 --> 04:29:56.280
PROGRAMS WORKING EFFECTIVELY AS.

04:29:56.346 --> 04:29:56.847
THEY CAN AND HOW DO WE HELP

04:29:56.914 --> 04:29:57.681
STRENGTHEN. THIS SO ALONG THOSE

04:29:57.748 --> 04:30:00.984
LAWS IT LOOKS. I KEEP I'M GOING

04:30:01.051 --> 04:30:02.219
TO STICK ON THESE QUESTIONS

04:30:02.286 --> 04:30:03.754
BECAUSE I FOUND THIS ISSUE

04:30:03.820 --> 04:30:05.689
PARTICULARLY FAXING OVER THE

04:30:05.756 --> 04:30:08.625
LAST FEW YEARS AND- I'M REALLY

04:30:08.692 --> 04:30:10.994
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AND DIG

04:30:11.061 --> 04:30:12.529
INTO THIS ONE DATA POINT WHICH

04:30:12.596 --> 04:30:14.831
IS THAT. 50% OF THE I. S.

04:30:14.898 --> 04:30:16.733
FELONY I S. T. POPULATION DID

04:30:16.800 --> 04:30:18.035
NOT GET TREATMENT SIX MONTHS

04:30:18.101 --> 04:30:22.039
PRIOR TO THEIR ARREST. AND SO

04:30:22.105 --> 04:30:23.807
IF THAT'S THE CASE MY

04:30:23.874 --> 04:30:25.309
UNDERSTANDING THEN WOULD BE

04:30:25.375 --> 04:30:26.977
THAT THEY MOST LIKELY WERE

04:30:27.044 --> 04:30:29.546
GETTING MISDEMEANOR. ARRESTS

04:30:29.613 --> 04:30:31.014
WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER FELONY

04:30:31.081 --> 04:30:32.883
ARE THE FULL SERVICE

04:30:32.950 --> 04:30:35.085
PARTNERSHIPS AND I'M WONDERING

04:30:35.152 --> 04:30:40.490

THAT CARE THAT LED TOWARDS THE-

04:30:44.595 --> 04:30:47.531
SUBSEQUENT FELONY ARREST AND I

04:30:47.598 --> 04:30:49.566
THINK THE PART THAT I'M- I'VE

04:30:49.633 --> 04:30:50.801
STRUGGLED WITH THE LAST COUPLE

04:30:50.867 --> 04:30:53.370
YEARS IS THE DISK JOINTED.

04:30:53.437 --> 04:30:56.640
ASPECT OF THIS. CARE AND I'M

04:30:56.707 --> 04:30:57.274
WONDERING WHY WE AREN'T

04:30:57.341 --> 04:30:59.376
STREAMLINING IT AND WHY WE

04:30:59.443 --> 04:31:04.514
DON'T HAVE A- MORE- WHOLISTIC

04:31:04.581 --> 04:31:06.516
APPROACH TO CARING AT THE

04:31:06.583 --> 04:31:08.485
COUNTY LEVEL TIME I GUESS NOW

04:31:08.552 --> 04:31:10.520
MY QUESTION IS FOR DR KELLY TO

04:31:10.587 --> 04:31:13.023
PULL YOU IN AND SEE IF I CAN

04:31:13.090 --> 04:31:15.225

THANK YOU TO RAMBLE WELL I

04:31:19.129 --> 04:31:20.364
THINK FIRST OF ALL THERE

04:31:20.430 --> 04:31:21.264
THERE'S AN ASSUMPTION BEING

04:31:21.331 --> 04:31:23.934
MADE THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN.

04:31:24.001 --> 04:31:25.335
DEEMED INCOMPETENT TO STAND

04:31:25.402 --> 04:31:26.970
TRIAL AS A MEDICARE BENEFICIARY

04:31:27.037 --> 04:31:29.172
SO THERE'S BACK NUMBER ONE-

04:31:29.239 --> 04:31:31.041
ALSO WE ARE SERVING EVERYONE IN

04:31:31.108 --> 04:31:32.542
COMMUNITY BUT WHEN YOU HAVE

04:31:32.609 --> 04:31:34.077
SOMEONE AND I'M SURE OUR

04:31:34.144 --> 04:31:36.113
PARTNERS DISH WILL HAVE MORE.

04:31:36.179 --> 04:31:37.681
LEGAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT

04:31:37.748 --> 04:31:39.716
I'M GOING TO STATE BUT AT LEAST

04:31:39.783 --> 04:31:40.417
SOMEONE IS FOUND TO BE

04:31:40.484 --> 04:31:41.918
INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL THAT

04:31:41.985 --> 04:31:42.986
MEANS THEY'RE THEY'RE CRIMINAL

04:31:43.053 --> 04:31:45.155
PROCEEDINGS STOPS THEY HAVE AN

04:31:45.222 --> 04:31:46.957
EVALUATION TO DETERMINE THEIR

04:31:47.024 --> 04:31:47.658
COMPETENCY AND THEN THEY ARE

04:31:47.724 --> 04:31:50.761
EITHER- THERE ARE A COUPLE. OF

04:31:50.827 --> 04:31:52.195
COMPETENCY CAN BE RESTORED

04:31:52.262 --> 04:31:53.730
WHETHER IT'S IN CUSTODY AT THE

04:31:53.797 --> 04:31:54.898
JAIL SYSTEM LIKE WHAT WE HAVE

04:31:54.965 --> 04:31:57.868
IN OUR COUNTY- AT OUR WEBSITE

04:31:57.934 --> 04:32:00.771
DETENTION CENTER OR- THEY COULD

04:32:00.837 --> 04:32:03.340
BE DEPENDING. ON A LOT OF

04:32:03.407 --> 04:32:05.242
THINGS- PLACED AT THE STATE

04:32:05.308 --> 04:32:06.943
HOSPITAL FOR THE RESTORATION OF

04:32:07.010 --> 04:32:08.945
THEIR COMPETENCY BUT ONCE THE

04:32:09.012 --> 04:32:10.514
COMPETENCIES RESTORING THE

04:32:10.580 --> 04:32:12.949
IDEAS THEY WOULD GO BACK. THE

04:32:13.016 --> 04:32:13.750
CRIMINAL PROCEEDING IS NOT

04:32:13.817 --> 04:32:16.186
SHOUT ON THE CRIME MIGHT HAVE

04:32:16.253 --> 04:32:17.487
STILL YOU KNOW STILL STILL

04:32:17.554 --> 04:32:19.356
EXISTED SO IT'S THE PROCESS

04:32:19.423 --> 04:32:21.725
THERE WE CERTAINLY SERVE PEOPLE

04:32:21.792 --> 04:32:23.627
WHO ARE ON PAROLE OR PROBATION

04:32:23.694 --> 04:32:25.595
WHO'VE COMMITTED CRIMES. AND

04:32:25.662 --> 04:32:31.601
THIS IS BRINGING. DIFFICULTY

04:32:31.668 --> 04:32:35.572
LIES FOR US IS- EVEN LOOKING AT

04:32:35.639 --> 04:32:37.607
DIVERSION DIVERSION MENTAL

04:32:37.674 --> 04:32:38.909
HEALTH DIVERSION FROM OUR

04:32:38.975 --> 04:32:41.411
SECURE COURTS PERSPECTIVE. IS

04:32:41.478 --> 04:32:43.947
IF THEY SEE SOMEONE WHO HAS A

04:32:44.014 --> 04:32:46.516
MENTAL HEALTH- RELATIONSHIP TO

04:32:46.583 --> 04:32:47.884
THE CRIME AND THEY CAN DIVERT

04:32:47.951 --> 04:32:49.186
THEM FROM THE COURT PROCEEDINGS

04:32:49.252 --> 04:32:51.755
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO. INTO

04:32:51.822 --> 04:32:54.091
A JAIL SYSTEM AND THEY CAN THEN

04:32:54.157 --> 04:32:57.160
BE. RECEIVED AND TREATMENT WITH

04:32:57.227 --> 04:33:01.364
US- AND THERE'S NO FUNDING FOR

04:33:01.431 --> 04:33:02.365
THAT THERE'S THE REGULAR

04:33:02.432 --> 04:33:03.567
FUNDING THAT WE HAVE TOO MANY

04:33:03.633 --> 04:33:04.901
CAL IF THE PERSON BEING

04:33:04.968 --> 04:33:06.670
REFERRED TO AS A MEDIC CAL

04:33:06.737 --> 04:33:09.206
BENEFICIARY SOMETIMES THEY ARE

04:33:09.272 --> 04:33:12.275
NOT. SO ADD TO YOUR POINT ABOUT

04:33:12.342 --> 04:33:14.311
IT BEING A DESPERATE SYSTEM

04:33:14.377 --> 04:33:15.612
EIGHT IT IS THAT I THINK THAT'S

04:33:15.679 --> 04:33:17.180
WHY HAVING THIS SORT OF A

04:33:17.247 --> 04:33:18.815
HEARING TO TALK WITH ALL OF OUR

04:33:18.882 --> 04:33:20.183
PARTNERS AT THE SAME TIME IS

04:33:20.250 --> 04:33:21.384
VERY BENEFICIAL I WOULD LIKE

04:33:21.451 --> 04:33:23.787
TO. TRANSPACIFIC TO THE

04:33:23.854 --> 04:33:24.821
DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS TO

04:33:24.888 --> 04:33:26.389
I'M SURE CHRIS IS ON I CAN SEE

04:33:26.456 --> 04:33:29.359
HER- I HAVE MORE INFORMATION ON

04:33:29.426 --> 04:33:30.093
THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION DOCTOR

04:33:30.160 --> 04:33:33.730
AND- WOULD LOVE TO POLARON

04:33:33.797 --> 04:33:36.900
MISFEASANCE. SHE WIRING- WHY

04:33:36.967 --> 04:33:40.504
I'M- MY PERSONAL. M. I MEAN I

04:33:40.570 --> 04:33:42.072
KIND OF THINK THAT SHE STEM

04:33:42.139 --> 04:33:43.373
FROM SORT OF THREE DIFFERENT

04:33:43.440 --> 04:33:46.176
SONGS- ONE EIGHT ONE IS

04:33:46.243 --> 04:33:47.744
CAPACITY THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

04:33:47.811 --> 04:33:50.280
NEEDS- MORE ALTERNATIVES TO

04:33:50.347 --> 04:33:51.748
DIVERT INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

04:33:51.815 --> 04:33:53.583
EXPERIENCING CRISIS RATHER THAN

04:33:53.650 --> 04:33:55.185
PUTTING THEM IN JAIL. AND I

04:33:55.252 --> 04:33:56.319
THINK THAT THEY WROTE HEALTH

04:33:56.386 --> 04:33:58.321
INFRASTRUCTURE PROPOSAL. AS

04:33:58.388 --> 04:34:00.390
WELL AS US-AS A AS AN

04:34:00.457 --> 04:34:01.491
ADMINISTRATION AS A STATE

04:34:01.558 --> 04:34:05.195
SOMETHING THAT I. N. G. WAIVER-

04:34:05.262 --> 04:34:06.897
FROM THE EXCLUSION ARM ARE

04:34:06.963 --> 04:34:08.231
GOING TO BASICALLY AND-

04:34:08.298 --> 04:34:09.900
EXPANDED OUR ABILITY AT THESE

04:34:09.966 --> 04:34:13.770
OPTIONS- ARM. TO AND I THINK

04:34:13.837 --> 04:34:14.738
THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST

04:34:14.805 --> 04:34:16.873
IMPORTANT PIECE OF IT IS BACK

04:34:16.940 --> 04:34:18.675
AYE ISSUE CONTENT COMMITMENT IS

04:34:18.742 --> 04:34:20.844
ONE OF THE ONLY PATHWAYS TO

04:34:20.911 --> 04:34:23.880
COMPEL. OR RATHER FORCE SOMEONE

04:34:23.947 --> 04:34:29.853
IN. AN ORDER THEM INTO

04:34:29.920 --> 04:34:31.221
TREATMENT. RIGHT- AND CAN WE

04:34:31.288 --> 04:34:33.857
LOOK OTHER STRAT. ARE IN THE

04:34:33.924 --> 04:34:34.991
COMMUNITY THAT WILL TO REDUCE

04:34:35.058 --> 04:34:36.726
THE LIKE. OF SOMEONE EXCUSE A

04:34:36.793 --> 04:34:38.028
MENTAL THAT WILL ULTIMATELY

04:34:38.094 --> 04:34:40.964
LEAD TO THAT. SO HOW DO WE GET

04:34:41.031 --> 04:34:42.465
TO THAT PLACE RIGHT AND THEN

04:34:42.532 --> 04:34:43.633
THE OTHER PIECE THAT WE'VE JUST

04:34:43.700 --> 04:34:46.670
BEEN HEARING- FROM THE PARTNERS

04:34:46.736 --> 04:34:47.938
THAT WILL WORKING WITH.

04:34:48.004 --> 04:34:51.007
DIVERSION IS REALLY HAVING AN

04:34:51.074 --> 04:34:52.609
ADEQUATELY TRAINED TO WORK

04:34:52.676 --> 04:34:54.911
TOWARDS- THOSE THAT ARE TRAINED

04:34:54.978 --> 04:34:56.112
ON THE INTERVENTIONS AND

04:34:56.179 --> 04:34:57.848
STRATEGIES TO EFFECTIVELY WORK

04:34:57.914 --> 04:34:58.882
WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

04:34:58.949 --> 04:35:00.917
SYSTEM AND THAT'S REALLY. YOU

04:35:00.984 --> 04:35:03.553
KNOW- THAT'S ASSESSING RISK

04:35:03.620 --> 04:35:05.755
THAT IS INCORPORATING

04:35:05.822 --> 04:35:07.324
STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE THAT

04:35:07.390 --> 04:35:08.859
RISK AS PART OF THEIR OVERALL

04:35:08.925 --> 04:35:10.660
HOLISTIC TREATMENT PLANS SO

04:35:10.727 --> 04:35:13.163
WORKING AT WORK. WORK

04:35:13.230 --> 04:35:15.632
INCREMENTALLY- TACKLING NASRI

04:35:15.699 --> 04:35:16.733
BUT THEY'VE REGION AND THEN

04:35:16.800 --> 04:35:19.002
ALSO WHAT PROPOSING YOUR SEATS.

04:35:19.069 --> 04:35:24.774
HE. BY YOU KNOW IT'S MY- SALT

04:35:24.841 --> 04:35:26.343
THAT. THAT PROGRAMS LIKE THE

04:35:26.409 --> 04:35:28.678
FULL SERVICE FOR. CAN BE FOR

04:35:28.745 --> 04:35:32.249
POPULATION BUT I THINK THE IS-

04:35:32.315 --> 04:35:34.885
AND TOTAL. THAT IT WAS ON A

04:35:34.951 --> 04:35:37.387
VOLUNTEER BASIS VERSUS WHAT THE

04:35:37.454 --> 04:35:39.356
I. S. T. MEDNAX WHERE IS THAT

04:35:39.422 --> 04:35:41.825
ABILITY TO COMPEL AND FORCE

04:35:41.892 --> 04:35:44.961
TREATMENT- WHICH WE DON'T LIKE

04:35:45.028 --> 04:35:46.863
TO SAY FORCED BUT IT IT IS IT

04:35:46.930 --> 04:35:49.599
IS- IT IS THAT LEGAL MECHANISM.

04:35:49.666 --> 04:35:51.001
MINUTE MECHANISM THAT IS

04:35:51.067 --> 04:35:52.702
REQUIRING THAT INDIVIDUAL TO

04:35:52.769 --> 04:35:54.905
RECEIVE TREATMENT I THINK WE

04:35:54.971 --> 04:35:56.740
ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT

04:35:56.806 --> 04:35:58.842
COMPETENCY RESTORATION IS

04:35:58.909 --> 04:36:01.378
REALLY NOTHING MORE FROM OUR

04:36:01.444 --> 04:36:04.114
ARMED STANCE. IS DESTABILIZING

04:36:04.180 --> 04:36:06.650
AN INDIVIDUAL THAT IS- ON

04:36:06.716 --> 04:36:10.020
EXPERIENCING ON OUR MENTAL

04:36:10.086 --> 04:36:12.389
HEALTH CRISIS RIGHT STABILIZING

THAT INDIVIDUAL BEGINNING I'M

04:36:13.924 --> 04:36:15.425
ON THE RIGHT MEDICATION

04:36:15.492 --> 04:36:17.127
STABILIZING THEM AND THEN

04:36:17.193 --> 04:36:18.828
TEACHING THEM YOU KNOW A FEW

04:36:18.895 --> 04:36:20.497
THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO DO IN

04:36:20.563 --> 04:36:21.898
ORDER TO AFFECTED WILL STAND

04:36:21.965 --> 04:36:24.501
TRIAL ALL. BUT ONCE THAT

04:36:24.567 --> 04:36:26.002
INDIVIDUAL IS STABILIZED IN

04:36:26.069 --> 04:36:28.905
WHATEVER ENVIRONMENT THAT IS

04:36:28.972 --> 04:36:30.307
THEY COULD THEN BE REVOKED AT

04:36:30.373 --> 04:36:32.642
AND CONSIDERED FOR DIVERSION OR

04:36:32.709 --> 04:36:40.517

REALLY IS THE ANALYSIS THAT THE

04:38:09.372 --> 04:38:11.174
STATE NEEDS TO CALL FOR. THE

04:38:11.241 --> 04:38:13.009
DEPARTMENT STATE HOSPITALS IN

SOME PHENOMENAL WORK AND OPEN

04:38:14.477 --> 04:38:15.645
THE DOOR ON THIS I THINK IT WAS

04:38:15.712 --> 04:38:17.347
DR WARBURTON ARE A PART OF HER

04:38:17.414 --> 04:38:19.482
TEAM THAT REALLY HIGHLIGHTED

04:38:19.549 --> 04:38:21.518
THAT PERCENTAGE THAT YOU

04:38:21.584 --> 04:38:24.354
REFERENCED AND SO THERE'S NOT A

04:38:24.421 --> 04:38:25.922
WHOLE SERIES OF QUESTIONS HERE

04:38:25.989 --> 04:38:27.957
AND WE ARE WORKING WITH COUNTY

04:38:28.024 --> 04:38:29.959
USED TO DO THAT ANALYSIS I'M IN

04:38:30.026 --> 04:38:32.796
A IN I THINK TEN COUNTIES WHERE

04:38:32.862 --> 04:38:34.864
WE ARE HELPING THEM CONNECT

04:38:34.931 --> 04:38:36.499
THEIR MENTAL HEALTH DATA AND

04:38:36.566 --> 04:38:38.201
THEIR CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA.

04:38:38.268 --> 04:38:39.436
BUILDING OFF OF THIS

04:38:39.502 --> 04:38:41.271
DIFFERENTIAL INTERCEPT MODEL

04:38:41.337 --> 04:38:43.440
AROUND VERSION SO THAT WE DON'T

04:38:43.506 --> 04:38:45.442
WAIT UNTIL THERE ARE FIFTEEN

04:38:45.508 --> 04:38:46.776
ARRESTS AND WE'RE ASKING THESE

04:38:46.843 --> 04:38:48.411
QUESTIONS ABOUT ARE THE RIGHT

04:38:48.478 --> 04:38:50.180
PEOPLE INFO SERVICE

04:38:50.246 --> 04:38:52.048
PARTNERSHIPS ARE NOT ARE WE

04:38:52.115 --> 04:38:54.084
DELIVERING COMMUNITY BASED CARE

04:38:54.150 --> 04:38:56.119
IN A WAY THAT IS VOLUNTARY SO

04:38:56.186 --> 04:38:58.488
THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO MOVE TO A

04:38:58.555 --> 04:39:00.090
CRIMINAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE

04:39:00.156 --> 04:39:03.059
STRATEGY OR- AT A STATE

04:39:03.126 --> 04:39:05.228
HOSPITAL KIND OF STRATEGY WHERE

04:39:05.295 --> 04:39:05.862
IDEAS ABOUT COMPETENCY

04:39:05.929 --> 04:39:08.398
RESTORATION. I'M BUT WE'RE NOT

04:39:08.465 --> 04:39:10.033
DOING THAT ANALYSIS STATEWIDE

04:39:10.100 --> 04:39:11.868
WE'RE NOT DOING THAT ANALYSIS

04:39:11.935 --> 04:39:13.036
AS THOROUGHLY AS NEEDS TO

04:39:13.103 --> 04:39:14.237
HAPPEN SO THAT WE CAN

04:39:14.304 --> 04:39:15.972
UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN MOVE

04:39:16.039 --> 04:39:17.674
LIMITED DOLLARS FROM VERY

04:39:17.740 --> 04:39:20.477
EXPENSIVE THE BAND CARE TWO

04:39:20.543 --> 04:39:22.979
MORE FLEXIBLE AFFORDABLE MORE

04:39:23.046 --> 04:39:25.115
VOLUNTARY PREVENTION EARLY

04:39:25.181 --> 04:39:27.117
INTERVENTION CARE AND AGAIN I

04:39:27.183 --> 04:39:28.651
KNOW I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE

04:39:28.718 --> 04:39:30.053
CAN TAKE PEOPLE OUT OF THE

04:39:30.120 --> 04:39:32.355
STATE HOSPITAL TODAY THIS IS

04:39:32.422 --> 04:39:34.891
MORE ABOUT HOW DO WE- MOVE OUR

04:39:34.958 --> 04:39:36.593
RESPONSE TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE

04:39:36.659 --> 04:39:39.596
HIGH END NEEDS. TO EARLY STAGES

04:39:39.662 --> 04:39:41.531
RIGHT IF WE WERE TO USE A

04:39:41.598 --> 04:39:43.500
CANCER ANALOGY WHAT'S ON THE

04:39:43.566 --> 04:39:45.568
TABLE IS BUILDING MORE CANCER

04:39:45.635 --> 04:39:48.304
WARDS RATHER THAN SAYING HOW DO

04:39:48.371 --> 04:39:50.473
WE PREVENT AND INTERVENE EARLY

04:39:50.540 --> 04:39:53.343
SO WE NEED LESS OF THESE HIGH

04:39:53.409 --> 04:39:55.645
AND THE PRESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS.

04:39:55.712 --> 04:39:57.413
AND AT THE MOMENT WE NEED BOTH

04:39:57.480 --> 04:39:59.749
M. BUT THERE'S A TREMENDOUS

04:39:59.816 --> 04:40:04.087
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE ANALYSIS.

04:40:04.154 --> 04:40:05.021
AT EACH COUNTY LEVEL- AND

04:40:05.088 --> 04:40:06.556
COUNTIES THAT IN TURN PASSED

04:40:06.623 --> 04:40:07.690
BUT MANY DOWN. AND THIS IS AN

04:40:07.757 --> 04:40:08.625
AREA WHERE THE STATE REALLY CAN

04:40:08.691 --> 04:40:10.460
SUPPORT OUR COUNTY PARTNERS TO

04:40:10.527 --> 04:40:12.395
UNDERSTAND THOSE OPPORTUNITIES

04:40:12.462 --> 04:40:14.330
TO TRACK POPULATIONS THROUGH

04:40:14.397 --> 04:40:16.166
THE SYSTEMS AND IDENTIFY THE

04:40:16.232 --> 04:40:17.267
AREAS WHERE WE NEED TO

04:40:17.333 --> 04:40:19.135
STRENGTHEN OUR INTERVENTIONS.

04:40:19.202 --> 04:40:20.603
REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN

04:40:20.670 --> 04:40:22.305
USE DOLLARS MORE EFFECTIVELY

04:40:22.372 --> 04:40:24.741
PARTICULARLY IF WE CAN PARTNER

04:40:24.807 --> 04:40:25.942
WITH BOTH THE FEDERAL

04:40:26.009 --> 04:40:27.577
GOVERNMENT ENTERS A MEDIC CAL.

04:40:27.644 --> 04:40:28.811
AND THE AND THE COMMERCIAL

04:40:28.878 --> 04:40:31.047
INSURANCE SECTOR SO I DON'T WE

04:40:31.114 --> 04:40:32.182
DON'T KNOW THE PERCENTAGE OF

04:40:32.248 --> 04:40:34.417
PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE PRIVATE

04:40:34.484 --> 04:40:36.386
SECTOR INSURANCE WHO NEED THESE

04:40:36.452 --> 04:40:38.822
THIS LEVEL OF CARE. BUT IN THE

04:40:38.888 --> 04:40:39.455
WORK THAT WE'RE SEEING AROUND

04:40:39.522 --> 04:40:41.624
EARLY PSYCHOSIS IS QUITE OFTEN

04:40:41.691 --> 04:40:43.326
YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE INSURANCE BUT

04:40:43.393 --> 04:40:45.261
AS THEIR NEEDS ESCALATE THEY

04:40:45.328 --> 04:40:46.663
OFTEN DROP OFF OF THEIR

04:40:46.729 --> 04:40:48.531
COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. AND THOSE

04:40:48.598 --> 04:40:49.732
COST SHIFT OVER TO THE PUBLIC

04:40:49.799 --> 04:40:52.835
SECTOR THAT'S AN AREA THAT

04:40:52.902 --> 04:40:54.837
NEEDS FURTHER EXPLORATION- WITH

04:40:54.904 --> 04:40:56.639
