RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. I'M

00:41:21.645 --> 00:41:22.880
HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE

00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:23.314
STATE WATER BOARDS

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.282
IMPLEMENTATION OF SENATE BILL

00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:26.350
FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO. WHICH

00:41:26.417 --> 00:41:27.885
DEALS WITH MICROPLASTICS IN

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:29.386
DRINKING WATER AS WELL FROM

00:41:29.453 --> 00:41:31.322
OTHER RELEVANT COMPONENTS THAT

00:41:31.388 --> 00:41:33.023
CONNECT TO THIS ISSUE. BY THE

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:34.158
END OF THE STOCK YOU'LL

00:41:34.225 --> 00:41:35.593
UNDERSTAND THAT PLASTIC DOES

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:37.094
NOT JUST GO AWAY. AND THAT THE

00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:38.863
WORK THAT WE'RE DOING THROUGH.

00:41:38.929 --> 00:41:40.631
THIS BILLS IMPLEMENTATION WILL

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:42.366
ALLOW FOR MORE CONCRETE ACTION

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:46.937
AND SOLUTIONS. PLASTIC I'M NOT

00:41:47.004 --> 00:41:51.108
SURE MY SLIDES EXCUSE ME WELL.

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:55.880
THERE WE GO. THE PLASTIC WASTE

00:41:55.946 --> 00:41:57.348
CRISIS HAS RECENTLY GAINED

00:41:57.414 --> 00:41:58.983
ATTENTION IN THE MEDIA

00:41:59.049 --> 00:42:00.718
EVERYWHERE WE LOOK WE SEEM TO

00:42:00.784 --> 00:42:02.286
FIND THE SYNTHETIC PARTICLES

00:42:02.353 --> 00:42:03.287
FROM THE DEEPEST PART OF THE

00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:06.624
OCEAN TO THE TALLEST MOUNTAIN.

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.259
IF WE CONTINUE WITH BUSINESS AS

00:42:08.325 --> 00:42:10.561
USUAL. WE WILL DOUBLE THE RATE

00:42:10.628 --> 00:42:11.462
AT WHICH PLASTIC ENTERS THE

00:42:11.528 --> 00:42:13.564
ENVIRONMENT BY THE YEAR TWENTY

00:42:13.631 --> 00:42:15.766
THIRTY. I SHOWN IN THIS TEAL

00:42:15.833 --> 00:42:19.570
LINE ON THIS GRAPH. PLASTIC

00:42:19.637 --> 00:42:21.038
DEGRADES IN THE ENVIRONMENT

00:42:21.105 --> 00:42:23.173
INTO SMALLER PARTICLES CALLED

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.708
MICROPLASTICS. PLASTIC

00:42:24.775 --> 00:42:26.243
PARTICLES MAY CONTAMINATE WATER

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:27.878
THROUGH MULTIPLE ROUTES

00:42:27.945 --> 00:42:29.046
INCLUDING FOR STORM WATER

00:42:29.113 --> 00:42:31.482
WASTEWATER AND ATMOSPHERIC

00:42:31.548 --> 00:42:33.017
DEPOSITION JUST TO NAME A FEW.

00:42:33.083 --> 00:42:35.486
ONCE IN WATER MICROPLASTICS MAY

00:42:35.552 --> 00:42:37.288
SINK AND BECOME SETTLEMENT AS

00:42:37.354 --> 00:42:38.989
WELL AS GET RESUSPENDED INTO

00:42:39.056 --> 00:42:40.691
THE WATER COLUMN WHERE THEY BE

00:42:40.758 --> 00:42:42.293
TAKEN UP INTO WASTE WATER

00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:43.961
TREATMENT PLANTS AND DRINKING

00:42:44.028 --> 00:42:46.430
WATER TREATMENT PLANTS. IT'S

00:42:46.497 --> 00:42:47.731
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WASTE

00:42:47.798 --> 00:42:48.666
WATER TREATMENT PLANTS ARE

00:42:48.732 --> 00:42:50.801
GENERALLY HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AT

00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:52.770
REMOVING MICROPLASTICS WITH

00:42:52.836 --> 00:42:54.838
REMOVAL RATES BETWEEN EIGHTY

00:42:54.905 --> 00:42:57.041
EIGHT AND 99% INTO SLUDGE AS

00:42:57.107 --> 00:42:59.076
SHOWN IN THIS DIAGRAM. REMOVAL

00:42:59.143 --> 00:43:00.811
RATES VARY BY TREATMENT PROCESS

00:43:00.878 --> 00:43:03.514
SEES AS SHOWN HERE WITH THAT

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:04.982
ADD MORE ADVANCED TREATMENT

00:43:05.049 --> 00:43:07.618
PROCESSES ARE MOVING MORE. AND

00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:08.953
WHEN LOOKING AT THIS FIGURE YOU

00:43:09.019 --> 00:43:10.220
MAY BE WONDERING WHERE THE

00:43:10.287 --> 00:43:12.156
SLUDGE CODES AND AS AS

00:43:12.222 --> 00:43:13.958
MENTIONED EARLIER BY ASSEMBLY

00:43:14.024 --> 00:43:16.627
MEMBER DR CORK- SOME OF IT

00:43:16.694 --> 00:43:18.128
ACTUALLY GOES TO AGRICULTURE.

00:43:18.195 --> 00:43:18.963
I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

00:43:19.029 --> 00:43:21.699
THAT NOW SO AFTER PROCESSING A

00:43:21.765 --> 00:43:24.201
PORTION OF THE SEWAGE SLUDGE IS

00:43:24.268 --> 00:43:25.469
GOOD IS OFTEN CONVERTED INTO

00:43:25.536 --> 00:43:27.705
BIOSOLIDS WHICH ARE NUTRIENT

00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:29.640
RICH ORGANIC SOLIDS THAT ARE

00:43:29.707 --> 00:43:30.774
OFTEN APPLIED TO LAND FOR

00:43:30.841 --> 00:43:33.577
GROWING CROPS COMPOSTING OR FOR

00:43:33.644 --> 00:43:34.812
DEEP WELL INJECTION TROUPE

00:43:34.878 --> 00:43:39.183
PRODUCED RENEWABLE ENERGY. DUE

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:40.184
TO THEIR POINT NATURE AND

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:42.019
PERSISTENCE IN THE ENVIRONMENT

00:43:42.086 --> 00:43:44.688
MICROPLASTICS CUMULATE AND TOP

00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:45.823
SOILS AND ARE FOUND IN HIGH

00:43:45.889 --> 00:43:46.924
QUANTITIES AND FIELDS WITH

00:43:46.991 --> 00:43:49.059
APPLIED BIOSOLIDS. ONE RECENT

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:51.762
STUDY ESTIMATED THAT BETWEEN

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:53.130
FORTY FOUR THOUSAND AND THREE

00:43:53.197 --> 00:43:53.864
HUNDRED THOUSAND TONS OF

00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:56.300
MICROPLASTICS INTO AGRICULTURAL

00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:58.602
EVERY YEAR IN NORTH AMERICA

00:43:58.669 --> 00:44:01.005
ALONE. I SHOWN HERE THE OTHERS

00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:02.206
THE MICROPLASTICS IN COMPOST

00:44:02.272 --> 00:44:04.441
WHICH MAY ALSO BE A RELEVANT

00:44:04.508 --> 00:44:07.444
SOURCE FOR AGRICULTURAL FIELDS.

00:44:07.511 --> 00:44:09.246
NOW WHAT HAPPENS CHIU PLANS

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:10.280
WHEN THEY'RE EXPOSED TO

00:44:10.347 --> 00:44:12.549
MICROPLASTICS AND SOIL. WE KNOW

00:44:12.616 --> 00:44:13.517
THAT PLANTS MAKE UP TAKE AND

00:44:13.584 --> 00:44:15.586
ACCUMULATE SMALL MICROPLASTICS

00:44:15.652 --> 00:44:16.954
THROUGH THEIR ROOTS AS

00:44:17.021 --> 00:44:18.322
VISUALIZED BY THESE GREEN

00:44:18.389 --> 00:44:20.257
FLUORESCENT LABELED

00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:23.594
MICROPLASTICS. EXPOSURE TO

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:25.729
MICROPLASTICS BECAUSE REDUCED

00:44:25.796 --> 00:44:28.065
PLANT GROWTH. DUE TO ROOF

00:44:28.132 --> 00:44:31.035
DAMAGE AS SHOWN IN THIS RECENT

00:44:31.101 --> 00:44:34.671
STUDY IN TWENTY TWENTY. AT HIGH

00:44:34.738 --> 00:44:36.073
ENOUGH CONCENTRATIONS

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.508
MICROPLASTICS HAVE BEEN SHOWN

00:44:37.574 --> 00:44:38.909
TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF

00:44:38.976 --> 00:44:41.278
MATURE TOMATOES HOWEVER MORE

00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:43.247
RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE

00:44:43.313 --> 00:44:45.315
WHAT IMPACTS TO AGRICULTURE

00:44:45.382 --> 00:44:47.084
EXIST- AND BASED ON THIS

00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:48.719
LIMITED EVIDENCE IT'S CLEAR

00:44:48.786 --> 00:44:50.421
THAT WE CANNOT DEPEND ENTIRELY

00:44:50.487 --> 00:44:52.156
ON WASTEWATER TREATMENT TO

00:44:52.222 --> 00:44:53.123
SOLVE THE ISSUE OF

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:54.725
MICROPLASTICS POLLUTION. AS

00:44:54.792 --> 00:44:56.593
DOING SO MAY CREATE ADDITIONAL

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.595
PROBLEMS WITH ACCUMULATION AND

00:44:58.662 --> 00:45:01.331
AGRICULTURAL FIELDS WHICH MAY

00:45:01.398 --> 00:45:05.502
THREATEN FOOD SECURITY. SO DUE

00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:07.137
TO THE WIDESPREAD CONTAINMENT

00:45:07.204 --> 00:45:07.638
OF MIKE CAN DUE TO THE

00:45:07.704 --> 00:45:08.906
WIDESPREAD CONTAMINATION OF

00:45:08.972 --> 00:45:10.307
MICROPLASTICS IT IS

00:45:10.374 --> 00:45:12.342
UNSURPRISING YET STARTLING. AT

00:45:12.409 --> 00:45:14.244
THE FIRST STUDY TO MONITOR FOR

00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:16.346
MICROPLASTICS IN TAP WATER BOND

MICROPLASTICS PROVIDING

00:52:34.217 --> 00:52:35.085
EVIDENCE THAT THESE PARTICLES

00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:37.921
ACCUMULATE IN THE HUMAN BODY

00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:38.421
AND ARE NOT JUST RAPIDLY

00:52:38.488 --> 00:52:41.358
EXCRETED. NOTABLY ONLY

00:52:41.424 --> 00:52:42.392
PARTICLES SMALLER THAN TEN

00:52:42.459 --> 00:52:43.760
MICROMETERS WERE FOUND IN THE

00:52:43.827 --> 00:52:48.064
SAMPLES. EVIDENCE FOR THE HUMAN

00:52:48.131 --> 00:52:49.499
HEALTH IMPACTS OF SMALLER

00:52:49.566 --> 00:52:51.468
PARTICLES WILL BE TAKEN INTO

00:52:51.535 --> 00:52:53.103
CONSIDERATION WHEN DEVELOPING

00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:54.638
OUR PLAN FOR FOUR YEARS OF

00:52:54.704 --> 00:52:56.006
TESTING AND ANALYSIS AND

00:52:56.072 --> 00:52:57.874
DRINKING WATER AS REQUIRED BY

00:52:57.941 --> 00:53:02.145
SENATE BILL. FOURTEEN TWENTY

00:53:02.212 --> 00:53:02.712
TWO. MICROPLASTIC PARTICLES

00:53:02.779 --> 00:53:04.948
SMALLER THAN TEN MICROMETERS

00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:06.082
ARE NOT ONLY BELIEVED TO BE

00:53:06.149 --> 00:53:08.051
MORE TOXIC TO HUMANS BUT

00:53:08.118 --> 00:53:10.520
UNFORTUNATELY THEY'RE ALSO MORE

00:53:10.587 --> 00:53:11.087
LIKELY TO OCCUR IN DRINKING

00:53:11.154 --> 00:53:12.822
WATER. RECENT STUDIES

00:53:12.889 --> 00:53:14.124
MONITORING MICROPLASTICS A

00:53:14.190 --> 00:53:16.760
DIFFERENT TREATMENT STAGES AND-

00:53:16.826 --> 00:53:18.528
DRINKING WATER TREATMENT PLANT.

00:53:18.595 --> 00:53:21.665
FOUNDED THAT. HAS TREATMENT

00:53:21.731 --> 00:53:25.368
INCREASES CONCENTRATIONS

00:53:25.435 --> 00:53:25.769
CONCENTRATIONS OF

00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:26.836
MICROPLASTICS. MICROPLASTICS

00:53:26.903 --> 00:53:29.072
DECREASE STARTING FROM RAW

00:53:29.139 --> 00:53:30.373
WATER ON THE LEFT IS SHOWN IN

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:32.509
THIS FIGURE TO FINISH DRINKING

00:53:32.576 --> 00:53:34.144
WATER ON THE RIGHT. WELL

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:35.612
TREATMENT REMOVES THE MAJORITY

00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:38.815
OF MICROPLASTICS. THESE THESE

00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:40.150
PARTICLES SMALLER THAN TEN

00:53:40.216 --> 00:53:43.620
MICRONS TEND TO REMAIN AND- I

00:53:43.687 --> 00:53:44.621
GUESS THESE PARTICLES ARE

00:53:44.688 --> 00:53:46.957
ACTUALLY THE MOST DIFFICULT TO

00:53:47.023 --> 00:53:48.625
MONITOR ANALYTICALLY SO ANOTHER

00:53:48.692 --> 00:53:52.362
CHALLENGE. MICROPLASTICS ARE

00:53:52.429 --> 00:53:53.697
FOUND IN DRINKING WATER AT

00:53:53.763 --> 00:53:55.265
RELATIVE PROPORTIONS THAT ARE

00:53:55.332 --> 00:53:57.000
SIMILAR TO THOSE OF PLASTICS

00:53:57.067 --> 00:53:58.668
AND COMMERCE SUGGESTING THAT

00:53:58.735 --> 00:54:00.437
THE ORIGIN OF THESE PARTICLES

00:54:00.503 --> 00:54:02.906
ARE LIKELY SINGLE USE PRODUCTS

00:54:02.973 --> 00:54:08.612
AND TEXTILES. SO IN CONCLUSION

00:54:08.678 --> 00:54:09.713
BOSTICK BREAKS DOWN INTO

00:54:09.779 --> 00:54:11.481
SMALLER PARTICLES ENVIRONMENT

00:54:11.548 --> 00:54:13.383
AND CAN CONTAMINATE WATER AND

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:14.851
LAND THESE PARTICLES ARE

00:54:14.918 --> 00:54:16.820
EVERYWHERE AND THEY DO NOT JUST

00:54:16.886 --> 00:54:18.922
GO AWAY. THE STATE WATER BOARDS

00:54:18.989 --> 00:54:20.690
REGULATORY DEFINITION

00:54:20.757 --> 00:54:21.958
STANDARDIZED METHODS AND%

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:23.627
LABORATORY ACCREDITATION

00:54:23.693 --> 00:54:25.362
PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED CONSISTENCY

00:54:25.428 --> 00:54:28.164
FOR THE FIELD. WHAT ONE

00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:29.165
THIRTIES REMAIN IN REGARD TO

00:54:29.232 --> 00:54:30.600
HUMAN HEALTH IMPACTS THE

00:54:30.667 --> 00:54:32.402
EVIDENCE IS INCREASING RAPIDLY

00:54:32.469 --> 00:54:35.639
AND WE WILL LEARN MORE IMPACTS-

00:54:35.705 --> 00:54:38.274
IT A VERY SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME.

00:54:38.341 --> 00:54:39.943
SO THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:42.012
AGAIN TO SPEAK TODAY AND I LOOK

00:54:42.078 --> 00:54:43.613
FORWARD TO ANSWER ANSWERING ANY

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:50.520
QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE- THIS IS

00:54:50.587 --> 00:54:51.721
THE FIRST TIME I'VE HEARD THIS

00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:53.890
BRIEFING AS WELL AND IT IS

00:54:53.957 --> 00:54:54.524
SCARIER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD

00:54:54.591 --> 00:54:57.761
BE- SENATOR BEN ALLEN HAS

00:54:57.827 --> 00:55:00.196
JOINED US. SENATOR DO YOU WANT

00:55:00.263 --> 00:55:01.831
TO MAKE A COMMENT AND THEN

00:55:01.898 --> 00:55:03.066
PERHAPS IF YOU HAVE ANY

00:55:03.133 --> 00:55:05.402
QUESTIONS- WILL DO WILL DEAL

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:06.102
WITH THEM AT THE END OF THE

00:55:06.169 --> 00:55:10.140
PANELS- DO I MAKE A COMMENT.

00:55:10.206 --> 00:55:11.207
VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE OBVIOUSLY

00:55:11.274 --> 00:55:12.409
THIS IS AN THEIR ISSUE IT'S

00:55:12.475 --> 00:55:14.778
VERY CLOSE TO MY- INTERESTED

00:55:14.844 --> 00:55:17.347
IN- FOR ALL THE REASONS JUST

00:55:17.414 --> 00:55:19.249
ARTICULATED AND SHOCKING DATA

00:55:19.315 --> 00:55:22.986
FOR UP 26% OF. YEAH SO

00:55:23.053 --> 00:55:24.054
HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET

00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:25.321
SOME SERIOUS WORKED ON THIS

00:55:25.388 --> 00:55:26.356
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS.

00:55:26.423 --> 00:55:29.426
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THEN OUR

00:55:29.492 --> 00:55:35.899
NEXT PANELIST- WE'RE GOING TO

00:55:35.965 --> 00:55:42.706
GO. DR REBECCA SUTTON SUTTON

00:55:42.772 --> 00:55:45.341
WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO ESTUARY

00:55:45.408 --> 00:55:48.378
INSTITUTE TO DISCUSS FINDINGS

00:55:48.445 --> 00:55:49.746
FROM THEIR STUDY UNDERSTANDING

00:55:49.813 --> 00:55:52.615
MICROPLASTIC LEVELS PATHWAYS

00:55:52.682 --> 00:55:54.484
AND TRANSPORT INTO THE SAN

00:55:54.551 --> 00:55:57.620
FRANCISCO BAY REGION THIS IS

00:55:57.687 --> 00:55:59.889
TRULY HEROIC WORK. UP UNTIL

00:55:59.956 --> 00:56:03.526
NOW- PEOPLE ARE SORT OF ASSUMED

00:56:03.593 --> 00:56:06.563
THAT PLASTIC STANDARD MEANT

00:56:06.629 --> 00:56:08.331
ENTERED THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS

00:56:08.398 --> 00:56:09.632
IS THE FIRST TIME WHERE THEY

00:56:09.699 --> 00:56:12.502
ACTUALLY MEASURE WHAT PLASTICS

00:56:12.569 --> 00:56:15.205
GETTING IN- FROM WHICH WE CAN

00:56:15.271 --> 00:56:19.342
GUESS WHAT THE SOURCES ARE. AND

00:56:19.409 --> 00:56:21.444
YOU KNOW IT'S REAL DATA IT'S

00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:24.347
NOT SOMEBODY'S GAS. IT'S REAL

00:56:24.414 --> 00:56:26.449
DATA AND WHILE THIS WAS DONE

00:56:26.516 --> 00:56:28.251
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE BAY IN THE

00:56:28.318 --> 00:56:32.322
ESTUARY- I BELIEVE THAT. WE CAN

00:56:32.388 --> 00:56:35.258
LEARN MUCH ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS

00:56:35.325 --> 00:56:36.926
TO OUR RIVERS THE SACRAMENTO

00:56:36.993 --> 00:56:39.262
AND SAN JOAQUIN RIVER UP FROM

00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:41.331
WHAT ENTRIES HERE BECAUSE THE

00:56:41.397 --> 00:56:42.298
SOURCES ARE GOING TO BE

00:56:42.365 --> 00:56:45.769
SIMILAR- THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:56:45.835 --> 00:56:50.507
SO WITH THAT OF DR SUTTON THANK

00:56:50.573 --> 00:56:52.742
YOU FOR THIS YEAR EXCELLENT

00:56:52.809 --> 00:56:55.979
WORK AND PLEASE THE PROJECT AND

00:56:56.045 --> 00:56:56.579
YOU HAVE UP TO FIFTEEN MINUTES

00:56:56.646 --> 00:56:59.215
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:56:59.282 --> 00:57:00.884
FOR THAT AND VERY GENEROUS

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:02.485
INTRODUCTION WE ARE VERY PROUD

00:57:02.552 --> 00:57:04.187
OF THIS THREE YEAR EFFORT THAT

00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:05.555
I'LL BE SHARING WITH YOU I'M

00:57:05.622 --> 00:57:07.357
WITH SAM SISCO ASSURANCE TO.

00:57:07.423 --> 00:57:08.825
AND WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT

00:57:08.892 --> 00:57:10.393
AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM SCIENCE

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.662
INSTITUTE LOCATED IN RICHMOND

00:57:12.729 --> 00:57:15.265
CALIFORNIA. THIS EFFORT IS A

00:57:15.331 --> 00:57:16.533
COLLABORATION WITH THE

00:57:16.599 --> 00:57:18.201
UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO ONE OF

00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:19.869
OUR LABOR SPEAKERS IS FROM

00:57:19.936 --> 00:57:20.870
THERE AND WITH THE FIVE GYRES

00:57:20.937 --> 00:57:23.406
INSTITUTE WARNED. OUR WORK HERE

00:57:23.473 --> 00:57:25.575
IS PART OF SFE EYES OVERALL

00:57:25.642 --> 00:57:27.410
MISSION TO PROVIDE SCIENTIFIC

00:57:27.477 --> 00:57:29.345
SUPPORT AND TOOLS FOR DECISION

00:57:29.412 --> 00:57:31.748
MAKING. SO THIS IS WHY WE WANT

00:57:31.815 --> 00:57:33.683
TO BRING THIS IMPORTANT

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:36.452
INFORMATION TO ALL OF YOU. SO

00:57:36.519 --> 00:57:38.688
QUICK WE WILL TALK ABOUT ALL

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:42.525
THE MONITORING. SKEWS ME JUST

00:57:42.592 --> 00:57:44.027
TRYING TO GET OUT THERE WE GOT

00:57:44.093 --> 00:57:45.328
GOT MY FLIGHT ADVANCED ALL

00:57:45.395 --> 00:57:46.696
RIGHT LET'S TALK ABOUT STUDY

00:57:46.763 --> 00:57:48.131
DESIGN WE DID A WHOLE LOT OF

00:57:48.198 --> 00:57:49.899
MONITORING AS PART OF THIS BIG

00:57:49.966 --> 00:57:51.734
THREE YEAR EFFORT. SO FOR THE

00:57:51.801 --> 00:57:54.871
BAY. WE LOOK AT MICRO PLASTICS

00:57:54.938 --> 00:57:56.840
IN THE SURFACE WATER SEEM DISKO

00:57:56.906 --> 00:57:58.641
BAY. WE ALSO LOOK AT MICRO

00:57:58.708 --> 00:58:00.410
PLASTICS IN THE SEDIMENT AT THE

00:58:00.476 --> 00:58:02.846
BOTTOM. AND THEN WE CUT FASHION

00:58:02.912 --> 00:58:04.314
WE EXTRACTED BIVALVES ARE

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.882
FILTER FEEDERS FROM THE BAY AND

00:58:05.949 --> 00:58:08.184
LOOK AT MICRO PLASTICS IN THESE

00:58:08.251 --> 00:58:10.553
TISSUES AS WELL. WE WENT OUT

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:11.988
THE GOLDEN GATE AND WE DID

00:58:12.055 --> 00:58:13.990
MONITORING OF THE SURFACE WATER

00:58:14.057 --> 00:58:14.457
IN THE NATIONAL MARINE

00:58:14.524 --> 00:58:16.860
SANCTUARIES. AND THEN WE WENT

00:58:16.926 --> 00:58:18.127
UPSTREAM HOW WE LOOK AT THE

00:58:18.194 --> 00:58:20.496
POLLUTION PATHWAYS SO THESE ARE

00:58:20.563 --> 00:58:21.898
WATER CENTER BEING DISCHARGED

00:58:21.965 --> 00:58:23.766
TO THE BANK AND FROM WHICH SOME

00:58:23.833 --> 00:58:25.068
OF THESE MICROPLASTICS MIGHT BE

00:58:25.134 --> 00:58:27.403
DIRECT SO. WE LOOKED AT WASTE

00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:29.005
WATER THAT'S ALL THE DOWN THE

00:58:29.072 --> 00:58:31.741
DRAIN DISCHARGES THAT GO TO THE

00:58:31.808 --> 00:58:33.243
SEWER SYSTEM THE WASTE WATER

00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:34.777
TREATMENT FACILITY THERE'S A

00:58:34.844 --> 00:58:36.179
LOT OF TREATMENT A LOT OF

00:58:36.246 --> 00:58:38.014
REMOVAL OF MICROPLASTICS AND

00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:39.916
THEN THAT TREATED WASTE WATER

00:58:39.983 --> 00:58:42.018
IS DISCHARGED TO THE BAY. WE

00:58:42.085 --> 00:58:43.887
ALSO LOOK AT STORMONT- NO

00:58:43.953 --> 00:58:45.455
THAT'S THE RAINFALL THAT HITS

00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:47.523
OUR STREETS IN OUR LANDSCAPES

00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:48.925
AND FROM THERE MOST OF THE

00:58:48.992 --> 00:58:50.526
STORM DRAIN OR THE CREEK OR THE

00:58:50.593 --> 00:58:52.462
STREAM. AND THEN ENDS UP IN SAN

00:58:52.528 --> 00:58:56.833
FRANCISCO BAY LARGELY UNTREATED.

00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:57.901
ALL RIGHT SO THAT'S THE

00:58:57.967 --> 00:58:58.501
MONITORING WE DID WHAT DID WE

00:58:58.568 --> 00:59:01.638
FIND. WE FOUND HIGH LEVELS OF

00:59:01.704 --> 00:59:03.439
MICROPLASTICS IN BAY WATER AND

00:59:03.506 --> 00:59:06.209
SEDIMENT RELATIVE TO OTHER

00:59:06.276 --> 00:59:06.910
WATER BODIES NEAR BIG URBAN

00:59:06.976 --> 00:59:09.112
CENTERS. THIS LITTLE BAR CHART

00:59:09.178 --> 00:59:10.980
IS OUR SURFACE WATER ABUNDANCE

00:59:11.047 --> 00:59:12.849
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT OUR MAJOR

00:59:12.916 --> 00:59:14.584
EFFORT IN TWENTY NINETEEN AS

00:59:14.651 --> 00:59:16.152
WELL AS A PILOT STUDY IN THE

00:59:16.219 --> 00:59:17.654
WET SEASON OF TWENTY SIXTEEN.

00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:19.656
SHOW MUCH HIGHER LEVELS OF

00:59:19.722 --> 00:59:22.292
MICROPLASTICS COMPARED TO OTHER

00:59:22.358 --> 00:59:23.693
MAJOR WATER BODIES WHERE WE

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:26.129
HAVE SIMILAR KINDS OF DATA

00:59:26.195 --> 00:59:28.464
DEVELOPED SO FAR. SO WHAT WE

00:59:28.531 --> 00:59:30.233
THINK IS GOING ON HERE IS THAT

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:32.201
WE'VE GOT A REALLY DENSE URBAN

00:59:32.268 --> 00:59:34.103
POPULATION AROUND THE DAY.

00:59:34.170 --> 00:59:35.638
WE'VE ALSO GOT WELL YOU COULD

00:59:35.705 --> 00:59:37.307
SAY THE BAY IS A SMALLER WATER

00:59:37.373 --> 00:59:39.108
BODY COMPARED TO SOMETHING BIG

00:59:39.175 --> 00:59:41.244
LIKE A GREAT LAKE. AND THEN WE

00:59:41.311 --> 00:59:42.845
GOT THIS CONSTRAINT INTERCHANGE

00:59:42.912 --> 00:59:44.380
WITH THE PACIFIC OCEAN SO

00:59:44.447 --> 00:59:45.381
LITTLE LAST FLASHING AND

00:59:45.448 --> 00:59:47.483
DILUTION. AND THESE FACTORS

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:49.018
TOGETHER TO MAKE THE SAN

00:59:49.085 --> 00:59:51.621
FRANCISCO BAY A VALUABLE PLACE

00:59:51.688 --> 00:59:52.522
TO LOOK FOR THESE PERSISTENT

00:59:52.588 --> 00:59:53.957
CONTAMINANTS THEY CAN REALLY

00:59:54.023 --> 00:59:56.659
BUILD UP SOME PLASTIC CAN BUILD

00:59:56.726 --> 00:59:58.594
UP IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY. WHEN

00:59:58.661 --> 00:59:59.829
IT COMES TO THE TYPES OF

00:59:59.896 --> 01:00:02.298
PARTICLES WE SAW. WE SAW A LOT

01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:04.934
OF FIBERS. ARE STILL ALMOST

01:00:05.001 --> 01:00:06.769
THREE QUARTERS OF THE PARTICLES

01:00:06.836 --> 01:00:08.838
WE SON SURFACE WATER OR FIBERS

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:10.773
AND THEN CLOSE TO TWO THIRDS

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.308
AROUND TWO THIRDS IN SENTIMENT.

01:00:12.375 --> 01:00:13.276
YOU CAN HEAR A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:15.278
ABOUT FIBERS ON AS WELL AS SOME

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:17.380
OF THE OTHER TYPES OF PARTICLES

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:20.416
WE SAW. IT ALSO TURNS OUT THE

01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:22.885
FISSION BIBLES WERE. PRIMARILY

01:00:22.952 --> 01:00:25.555
INGESTING OR- HAD IN THEIR GUTS

01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:28.891
FIBERS. SO THESE TWO BY BART

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:30.994
YEAH HI CHARTS ARE ON THE LEFT

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:32.762
IS A COUPLE OFFICIALLY EXAMINED

01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:33.763
ON THE RIGHT IT'S THE COUPLE OF

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:35.798
FILTER FEEDERS AND BOTH OF THEM

01:00:35.865 --> 01:00:37.667
ARE LARGELY THE BLUE COLOR

01:00:37.734 --> 01:00:39.535
SIGNIFYING FIBERS WERE THAT

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:41.637
CONTENTS OF THAT THE TISSUES

01:00:41.704 --> 01:00:43.306
THAT WE EXAMINED SO NOT ONLY

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:44.340
ARE THESE FIBERS IN OUR

01:00:44.407 --> 01:00:45.241
RETIREMENT BUT THEY SEEM TO BE

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:49.045
INGESTED. BY THE ORGANISMS THAT

01:00:49.112 --> 01:00:52.315
WE EXAMINE SAN FRANCISCO BAY.

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:54.784
WE'RE GOOD FIBERS BECOMING FROM.

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:56.986
ONE PATHWAY IT'S ALREADY SEEN

01:00:57.053 --> 01:00:58.021
SOME SOME GOOD WORK HERE AND

01:00:58.087 --> 01:01:00.189
ELSEWHERE IS THINKING ABOUT

01:01:00.256 --> 01:01:01.090
FIBERS COMING THROUGH

01:01:01.157 --> 01:01:03.426
WASTEWATER AND SO THIS GETS TO

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:04.193
THE FACT WE HAVE A LOT OF

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.995
SYNTHETIC GARMENTS IN OUR LIVES

01:01:06.062 --> 01:01:08.297
ENHANCE WE THROW OUR SYNTHETIC

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:09.265
TEXTILES IN THE WASHING

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:11.768
MACHINE. THERE'S THE ABRASION

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:12.702
AND THAT CAN LEAD TO SOME

01:01:12.769 --> 01:01:15.138
SHEDDING OF FIBERS THAT GOES

01:01:15.204 --> 01:01:17.707
INTO THE WASH WATER AND THEN

01:01:17.774 --> 01:01:18.841
HEADS TO THE TREATMENT FACILITY.

01:01:18.908 --> 01:01:20.710
NOT TRIMMING CAMERA REMOVE A

01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:22.078
LOT OF MICROPLASTICS WE

01:01:22.145 --> 01:01:23.946
MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT ALREADY-

01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:25.515
BUT THERE IS SOME LEVEL THAT

01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:27.517
REMAINS IN THE TREATED WATER

01:01:27.583 --> 01:01:30.286
GETS DISCHARGED TO THE BANK. SO

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:32.088
FOR OUR STUDY WE LOOKED AT THE

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:33.589
EIGHT LARGEST FACILITIES JUST

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:34.991
CHARGING TO THE BANK AND WE DID

01:01:35.058 --> 01:01:37.994
FIND MICROPLASTICS IN THESE AT

01:01:38.061 --> 01:01:39.896
IN THE SAMPLES. ARE AVERAGE

01:01:39.962 --> 01:01:41.597
LEVELS OF POINT ZERO SIX

01:01:41.664 --> 01:01:42.965
PARTICLES PER LITER AND FIBERS

01:01:43.032 --> 01:01:44.934
BEING COMMENT SO THIS SUPPORTS

01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:47.303
THE IDEA THAT FIBERS AND OTHER

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:48.704
MICROPLASTICS CAN END UP IN THE

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:50.873
BAY. THROUGH THE PATHWAY OF

01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:53.576
WASTE WATER. THIS IS NOT THE

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:56.112
ONLY PATHWAY ACTUALLY STORM

01:01:56.179 --> 01:01:58.181
WATER TURNED OUT TO BE A BIT OF

01:01:58.247 --> 01:01:59.415
A SURPRISE FOR US A MUCH BIGGER

01:01:59.482 --> 01:02:01.784
DEAL. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:04.320
STORMWATER SAMPLES WE SAW FAR

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:06.489
HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF ALL

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:08.191
THE PARTICLES FIBRES IN ON

01:02:08.257 --> 01:02:10.259
FIBERS IN OUR STORMWATER

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:11.928
COMPARED TO OUR WASTE WATER.

01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:13.629
NOW THIS ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE

01:02:13.696 --> 01:02:14.330
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:16.966
THAT STORM WATER NINE GENERAL

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:18.301
GENERALLY IN THE BAY AREA AND

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:20.303
IN MUCH OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:22.038
TREATED SO THERE'S NO CHANCE

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:23.406
FOR THE PARTICLES TO SETTLE OUT

01:02:23.473 --> 01:02:24.841
OR BE REMOVED THROUGH TREATMENT

01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:26.709
AND SO THAT THEY CAN RUSH RIGHT

01:02:26.776 --> 01:02:29.112
INTO WATERWAYS. NOW WE CAN TAKE

01:02:29.178 --> 01:02:30.413
THESE KIND OF CONCENTRATIONS

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.514
AND WE CAN PLUG THEM INTO

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:33.282
MODELS TO TRYING TO COME UP

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:35.751
WITH THE- ANNUAL DISCHARGE OF

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:37.053
THE ANNUAL LOAN FROM EACH OF

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.888
THESE PATHWAYS TO THE DAY. AND

01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:39.956
SO WHEN WE MADE THESE ARE

01:02:40.022 --> 01:02:41.891
MODELING ESTIMATES. WE

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:44.093
DETERMINED AN ESTIMATE OF

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.661
SEVENTEEN BILLION MICROPLASTIC

01:02:45.728 --> 01:02:47.530
PARTICLES ENTERING THE BASE

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.098
YOUR WASTE WATER. WHEN WE GET

01:02:49.165 --> 01:02:50.900
AT A DIFFERENT CALCULATION FOR

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:53.669
STORMWATER. IS THAT RAINFALL

01:02:53.736 --> 01:02:54.370
THAT RUNS THROUGH THE

01:02:54.437 --> 01:02:56.873
LANDSCAPE. WE ACTUALLY GOT A

01:02:56.939 --> 01:03:00.042
FINAL US SEVEN TRILLION. STICKS

01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.676
AND THESE MODELS THERE'S A

01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:02.011
NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT GOES

01:03:02.078 --> 01:03:03.412
THAT GO INTO THESE MODELS AND

01:03:03.479 --> 01:03:04.147
YOU CAN ADJUST THOSE

01:03:04.213 --> 01:03:06.282
ASSUMPTIONS BUT NO MATTER HOW

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:08.217
WE ADJUSTED THEM. WE STILL SAW

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:10.119
THAT STORM WATER AND

01:03:10.186 --> 01:03:11.721
DISCHARGING OVER THREE HUNDRED

01:03:11.787 --> 01:03:14.624
TIMES MORE MICRO PLASTICS AND

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:16.259
WASTEWATER. SO ALTHOUGH THESE

01:03:16.325 --> 01:03:17.426
PATHWAYS ARE IMPORTANT THIS

01:03:17.493 --> 01:03:18.694
STUDY REALLY OPENED OUR EYES TO

01:03:18.761 --> 01:03:20.730
STORMWATER WHICH HAD NOT BEEN.

01:03:20.796 --> 01:03:21.931
INVESTIGATED VERY MUCH IN THE

01:03:21.998 --> 01:03:24.200
LITERATURE AND SO WE'RE VERY

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:25.635
EXCITED TO DO SOME FOLLOW UP

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:26.969
WORK FUNDED BY THE OCEAN

01:03:27.036 --> 01:03:28.571
PROTECTION COUNCIL TO TRYING TO

01:03:28.638 --> 01:03:30.339
EXAMINE POTENTIAL SOURCES FOR

01:03:30.406 --> 01:03:32.275
STORMWATER. THE OCEAN

01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:33.976
PROTECTION COUNCIL ALSO FUNDING

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:35.778
A STUDY ON MICRO PLASTICS AND

01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:38.481
WASTEWATER SO A LOT OF EFFORT

01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:39.782
HERE TO UNDERSTAND THESE

01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:41.384
PATHWAYS BECAUSE IF WE CAN

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:42.818
FIGURE OUT THAT. THE PARTICLES

01:03:42.885 --> 01:03:44.887
IN THE PATHWAYS MAYBE WE CAN

01:03:44.954 --> 01:03:47.323
GET THESE PARTICLES OUT OF THE

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:51.027
PATHWAYS AND PROTECT OUR WATERS.

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:51.994
NOW ONE OF THE TYPES OF

01:03:52.061 --> 01:03:53.829
PARTICLE IT WE SOUGHT

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:55.965
ESPECIALLY IN STORMWATER. ALSO

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:57.533
IN OUR BASEMENT WHERE THESE

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.635
BLACK REVEREND FRAGMENTS AND WE

01:03:59.702 --> 01:04:00.703
BELIEVE MANY OF THESE ARE

01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:03.206
DERIVED FROM TIRES. AND THIS IS

01:04:03.272 --> 01:04:05.508
PART OF ACTUAL THAT THAT. DON'T

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:07.009
THE NECESSARY FUNCTION OF TIRES

01:04:07.076 --> 01:04:08.411
YOU KNOW THE GRIP ON THE ROAD

01:04:08.477 --> 01:04:09.745
THIS IS HOW THE TIRES ARE

01:04:09.812 --> 01:04:11.747
KEEPING US SAFE BUT IT ALSO. AS

01:04:11.814 --> 01:04:13.149
THE TIRES RIVING IT'S SHEDDING

01:04:13.216 --> 01:04:15.484
LITTLE BITS OF ROBERT AND THESE

01:04:15.551 --> 01:04:17.019
CAN BE WASHED INTO WATERWAYS WE

01:04:17.086 --> 01:04:19.055
SAW HIGH LEVELS IN OUR STORM

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:22.925
WATER ALMOST HALF THE PARTICLES

01:04:22.992 --> 01:04:23.426
WERE THESE BLACK REFEREE

01:04:23.492 --> 01:04:24.694
FRAGMENTS. LET'S COME TIMES

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.962
EXTRA IMPORTANT WHEN YOU THINK

01:04:26.028 --> 01:04:27.096
ABOUT THE INGREDIENTS IN THE

01:04:27.163 --> 01:04:30.333
RIVER. JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO A

01:04:30.399 --> 01:04:31.968
BIG STUDY CAME OUT IN SCIENCE

01:04:32.034 --> 01:04:33.469
WE GOT TO BE INVOLVED WITH IT

01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:35.438
WHERE SITE TEAM OF SCIENTISTS

01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:38.007
IN WASHINGTON STATE IDENTIFY A

01:04:38.074 --> 01:04:40.443
SPECIFIC PRESERVATIVE CHEMICAL

01:04:40.509 --> 01:04:43.045
ENTIRE RIVER. THAT TRANSFORMS

01:04:43.112 --> 01:04:44.747
IN THE ENVIRONMENT TO AN

01:04:44.814 --> 01:04:47.116
EXTREMELY LETHAL TOXICANT FOR

01:04:47.183 --> 01:04:49.352
CO HOSTING AND- CALL SALMON ARE

01:04:49.418 --> 01:04:51.487
THREATENED AND ENDANGERED IN A

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:53.155
NUMBER OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:55.524
TRIBUTARIES. OUR ROLE IN THIS

01:04:55.591 --> 01:04:57.593
STUDY WE GRAB SOME STORM WATER

01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:59.262
SAMPLES FROM THE BAY AREA THESE

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:01.731
DREAMS DO NOT SUPPORT COHO- BUT

01:05:01.797 --> 01:05:03.766
WHEN WE SENT THESE SAMPLES TO

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:05.668
THE LAB THANK FOUND LETHAL

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:07.803
LEVELS UNDER TIRE CONTAMINANT

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:09.705
IN THESE IN THESE BAY AREA

01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:11.507
STORMWATER SAMPLES SO THIS IS

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:14.076
IMPORTANT. I STRESSOR THAT THAT

01:05:14.143 --> 01:05:16.012
MUST BE CONSIDERED IN ANY

01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:18.247
STREAM WHERE CALL HOW ARE

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:19.682
CURRENTLY LIVING OR WHERE THEY

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:21.450
MIGHT BE REINTRODUCED WE WOULD

01:05:21.517 --> 01:05:22.685
CERTAINLY WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:24.487
THIS. CHEMICAL STRESSOR WERE

01:05:24.553 --> 01:05:28.457
NOT CAUSING PROBLEMS. FOR COHO

01:05:28.524 --> 01:05:30.293
POPULATIONS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:05:30.359 --> 01:05:31.794
THINK ABOUT THESE PARTICLES IS

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:34.063
NOT JUST PHYSICAL CONTAMINANTS

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:36.565
BUT ALSO AS CARRIERS OF TOXIC

01:05:36.632 --> 01:05:39.435
INGREDIENTS. I TURNED OUT THE

01:05:39.502 --> 01:05:40.803
DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:42.271
CONTROL IS TAKING A LOOK AT

01:05:42.338 --> 01:05:44.307
TIRE INGREDIENTS AS PART OF

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:45.274
THEIR SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS

01:05:45.341 --> 01:05:47.476
PROGRAM. YES SOME ATTENTION IN

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:49.245
PARTICULAR ON THIS PRESERVATIVE

01:05:49.312 --> 01:05:50.346
AGENT THAT'S JUST BEEN

01:05:50.413 --> 01:05:52.014
IDENTIFIED AS THE SOURCE OF

01:05:52.081 --> 01:05:55.518
THIS CALL HOME TOXICANT. AND SO.

01:05:55.584 --> 01:05:57.787
WHAT A GREAT OUTCOME FOR THIS

01:05:57.853 --> 01:06:00.156
KIND OF EFFORT COULD BE AT TIRE

01:06:00.222 --> 01:06:02.291
MADE US SAFER INGREDIENTS AND

01:06:02.358 --> 01:06:03.592
THAT WAY EVEN IF IT'S SHUTTING

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:05.161
LITTLE BITS OF PLASTIC OR

01:06:05.227 --> 01:06:07.463
RUBBER IN THESE THESE. PIECES

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:10.433
OUT OF. RIGHT CONTAMINATION ARE

01:06:10.499 --> 01:06:14.303
NOT HARMING THE WILD. NOW WE

01:06:14.370 --> 01:06:15.705
SAW OTHER SOURCES OF

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:17.106
MICROPLASTICS AS WELL BESIDES

01:06:17.173 --> 01:06:18.808
THE TIRES OBVIOUSLY MENTION

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:21.177
FIBERS WE SEE POLYESTER ACRYLIC

01:06:21.243 --> 01:06:22.511
MANY OF THE SORT OF CLOTHING

01:06:22.578 --> 01:06:24.547
TYPE FIBERS IN OUR CLOSETS

01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:28.150
TODAY. DOCTOR COTTON MENTIONED

01:06:28.217 --> 01:06:30.086
CELLULOSE ACETATE ARE BACK CAN

01:06:30.152 --> 01:06:31.921
BE IN CIGARETTE FILTERS SO WE

01:06:31.987 --> 01:06:33.289
SAW THE NUMBER SIX RANKED

01:06:33.356 --> 01:06:34.990
CELLULOSE ACETATE FIBERS THAT

01:06:35.057 --> 01:06:37.360
COULD BE DERIVED FROM CIGARETTE

01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:39.962
POLLUTION. WE DID SEE SOME

01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:41.931
MICROBEADS AS WELL IN OUR WASTE

01:06:41.997 --> 01:06:45.067
WATER I NOW IN THE US.

01:06:45.134 --> 01:06:47.269
MICROBEADS ARE BANNED AND RINSE

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:49.271
OFF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS. SO

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:50.072
THESE MICROBEADS COULD BE

01:06:50.139 --> 01:06:51.674
DERIVED FROM OLDER PRODUCTS

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:53.676
STILL IN USE OR PERHAPS FROM A

01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:55.010
TYPE OF PRODUCT THAT'S OUTSIDE

01:06:55.077 --> 01:06:58.114
THAT RINSE OFF PERSONAL USE. OR

01:06:58.180 --> 01:06:59.982
PERSONAL CARE GROUPING OF

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:03.386
PRODUCTS. AND THEN FINALLY WE

01:07:03.452 --> 01:07:05.054
SAW PARTICLES THAT COULD BE

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:05.955
DERIVED FROM SINGLE USE

01:07:06.021 --> 01:07:07.723
PLASTICS OF THIS LITTLE EXAMPLE

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:09.325
UP HERE IT'S THAT SOME PHONES

01:07:09.392 --> 01:07:10.726
POLYSTYRENE SO YOU COULD

01:07:10.793 --> 01:07:12.094
IMAGINE THAT COULD BE DERIVED

01:07:12.161 --> 01:07:13.963
FROM YOU KNOW SOME THAT FOAM

01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:16.065
PACKAGING SURROUNDING A PRODUCT

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:18.501
FOR PROTECTIONOR PERHAPS AT.

01:07:18.567 --> 01:07:20.703
FOAM TAKEOUT CONTAINER- SO WE

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:22.371
SEE PARTICLES LIKE THAT THAT

01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:24.507
COULD BE RELATED TO SINGLE USE

01:07:24.573 --> 01:07:27.843
PLASTIC IN OUR PAIN FACT. SO

01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:29.044
JUST TO SUMMARIZE THE KEY

01:07:29.111 --> 01:07:31.113
FINDINGS HERE- WE DID SEE HIGH

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:33.015
LEVELS OF MICROPLASTICS IN OUR

01:07:33.082 --> 01:07:36.085
SAN FRANCISCO BAY. FIBERS WERE

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:37.753
PARTICULARLY WIDESPREAD AMONG

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:39.188
THE DIVERSE TYPES OF PARTICLES

01:07:39.255 --> 01:07:42.024
WE OBSERVED. WE SEE STORM WATER

01:07:42.091 --> 01:07:43.893
ISN'T AS AN IMPORTANT PATHWAY

01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:45.428
FOR FURTHER WORK IN ONE THAT

01:07:45.494 --> 01:07:46.896
HASN'T BEEN STUDIED QUITE AS

01:07:46.962 --> 01:07:49.632
MUCH AS WASTE WATER YEAH.

01:07:49.698 --> 01:07:51.467
EVERYTHING OF TIRES AS A SOURCE

01:07:51.534 --> 01:07:53.369
OF MICROPLASTICS AS WELL AS

01:07:53.436 --> 01:07:54.804
TOXIC CHEMICALS SO WE

01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:56.138
DEFINITELY WANT TO THINK ABOUT.

01:07:56.205 --> 01:07:57.406
NOT JUST THESE PHYSICAL

01:07:57.473 --> 01:07:58.741
PARTICLES BUT THE INGREDIENTS

01:07:58.808 --> 01:08:01.544
THAT MAKE UP THE PLASTIC. IF WE

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:04.113
CAN MAKE PLASTIC LESS TOXIC

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:05.181
THAN THE MICROPLASTICS

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:07.249
THEMSELVES WILL ALSO BE LESS

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:10.319
TOXIC TO OUR WILD WHICH- I WANT

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:10.820
TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR STUDY

01:08:10.886 --> 01:08:13.689
FUNDERS. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR

HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND

01:10:50.446 --> 01:10:51.547
I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS

01:10:51.614 --> 01:10:53.215
BECAUSE WE'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:54.049
OUR ROLE AS ENVIRONMENTAL

01:10:54.116 --> 01:10:56.418

01:10:56.485 --> 01:10:57.853
BEEN OF PARTICULAR DRIVING

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.288
FORCE MOTIVATING US TO

01:10:59.355 --> 01:11:01.557

SOURCE CONTROL PROGRAM WHICH I

01:11:09.698 --> 01:11:11.100
ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AS JUST

01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:12.334
ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT WE USE TO

01:11:12.401 --> 01:11:15.037
PREVENT CONTAMINANTS FROM

ENTERING OUR TREATMENT PLANTS

01:11:15.704 --> 01:11:20.376
IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO BEFORE

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:21.677
WE DISCUSS THE PREVALENCE OF

01:11:21.744 --> 01:11:23.579
MICROPLASTICS IN WASTE WATER I

01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:24.913
DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LOOK

01:11:24.980 --> 01:11:26.815
AT THE BIG PICTURE. AND

01:11:26.882 --> 01:11:28.751
CONSIDER ALL THE WAYS THAT

01:11:28.817 --> 01:11:29.284
MICROPLASTIC CAN ENTER THE

01:11:29.351 --> 01:11:31.353
ENVIRONMENT. AND I'D LIKE TO

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.188
FOCUS ON THIS GRAPHIC MADE BY

01:11:33.255 --> 01:11:34.657
FELLOW PANELIST DR CHELSEA

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:36.358

DIVERSITY AND SOURCES AND

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.529
PATHWAYS OF MICROPLASTIC. AND

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:41.697
HERE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:42.865
POINT OUT THE DISTINCTION

01:11:42.931 --> 01:11:45.401
BETWEEN THESE WO TERMS- OR

01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:47.636
SOURCES ARE WHERE MICROPLASTICS

01:11:47.703 --> 01:11:50.139
ARE PRODUCED AND ORIGINATE. AND

01:11:50.205 --> 01:11:52.641
WHERE THE PATHWAYS HERE BELOW

01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:53.442
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:11:53.509 --> 01:11:55.511
TRANSPORTING MICROPLASTICS FROM

01:11:55.577 --> 01:11:57.880
THEIR SOURCE TO THE ENVIRONMENT.

01:11:57.946 --> 01:12:00.015
PATHWAYS CAN INCLUDE RIVERS AND

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:02.618
WINS ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION

01:12:02.685 --> 01:12:04.753
DIRECT IMPORTS DIFFERENT TYPES

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.355
OF RUNOFF AND WASTEWATER OF

01:12:06.422 --> 01:12:09.291
COURSE. AND ONE LAST THING I'D

01:12:09.358 --> 01:12:10.793
LIKE TO UNDERSCORE HERE IS THE

01:12:10.859 --> 01:12:12.995
SIGNIFICANCE OF DEGRADED AND

01:12:13.062 --> 01:12:14.229
MISMANAGED WASTE AND LITTER IN

01:12:14.296 --> 01:12:16.799
PARTICULAR BECAUSE EVERY PIECE

01:12:16.865 --> 01:12:18.634
OF MICROPLASTIC THAT MAY ONE

01:12:18.701 --> 01:12:20.069
DAY BE A SOURCE OF MICROPLASTIC

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:22.738
IN THE ENVIRONMENT. AND I'D

01:12:22.805 --> 01:12:24.173
LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AND APPLIED

01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:25.407
THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL

01:12:25.474 --> 01:12:27.843
OPC FOR THEIR RECENT UNVEILING

01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:29.344
OF RECOMMENDED ACTIONS TO

01:12:29.411 --> 01:12:30.879
ADDRESS PLASTIC POLLUTION AND

01:12:30.946 --> 01:12:32.347
CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL AND MARINE

01:12:32.414 --> 01:12:34.016
ECOSYSTEM. THIS IS REALLY A

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:35.751
BOLD AND NECESSARY STEP TO

01:12:35.818 --> 01:12:37.286
TACKLE THIS PROBLEM AND WE HOPE

01:12:37.352 --> 01:12:41.690
TO SEE MORE OF THIS. SO IT

01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:43.092
SWITCHING GEARS NOW TO WASTE

01:12:43.158 --> 01:12:44.059
WATER SPECIFICALLY WHAT DO WE

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:47.162

THIS PURPOSE THEY WERE DESIGNED

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:10.018
FOR HUMAN WASTE WHICH IS AN

01:13:10.085 --> 01:13:11.587
IMPORTANT CONCEPT WHEN

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:17.359
UNDERSTANDING THEIR ROLE. NOW

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:18.127
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT

ON THE RIGHT SIDE. WILL INCLUDE

01:13:56.698 --> 01:13:58.934
PLASTIC FIBERS RELEASED DURING

01:13:59.001 --> 01:13:59.668
THE WASHING OF SYNTHETIC

01:13:59.735 --> 01:14:02.671
CLOTHING AS WELL AS TIRE WEAR

01:14:02.738 --> 01:14:04.139
FOR SYSTEMS THAT CO MINGLE

01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:06.208
URBAN ENOUGH OR STORM WATER.

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:08.210
AND DEGRADED AND RELEASED

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:10.112
FRAGMENTS FROM LARGER MACRO

01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:12.514
PLASTICS PAINTS. ALL OF THESE

01:14:12.581 --> 01:14:13.615
CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE LOADINGS

01:14:13.682 --> 01:14:16.285
THAT COME INTO WASTEWATER

01:14:16.351 --> 01:14:16.819
TREATMENT PLANTS AND THEIR

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:21.123
ROSTER WHICH. SO WHAT IS THE

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:22.524
GENERAL FATE AND TRANSPORT OF

01:14:22.591 --> 01:14:23.859
MICROPLASTICS IN WASTEWATER

01:14:23.926 --> 01:14:25.127
TREATMENT PLANTS YOU MIGHT

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:26.962
RECOGNIZE THIS AS A SIMILAR

01:14:27.029 --> 01:14:28.063
VERSION TO WHAT DOCTOR COFFIN

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:30.499
PRESENTED. AND I'D LIKE TO JUST

01:14:30.566 --> 01:14:31.033
GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:14:31.099 --> 01:14:33.168
DETAIL HERE. SO THIS SIMPLIFIED

01:14:33.235 --> 01:14:35.070
GRAPHIC SUMMARIZES WHAT WE KNOW

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:36.405
ABOUT DIFFERENT STAGES OF

01:14:36.471 --> 01:14:38.440
WASTEWATER TREATMENT. AND HOW

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:40.209
EFFECTIVE THEY ARE IN REMOVING

01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:42.311
MICROPLASTICS FROM THE AFFLUENT.

01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:43.912
IF YOU CONSIDER THE INCOMING

01:14:43.979 --> 01:14:46.315
INFLUENCE AS HAVING 1100% OF

01:14:46.381 --> 01:14:48.483
THE MICROPLASTIC LOAD FROM ALL

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:51.587
OF THESE POTENTIAL SOURCES.

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:53.622
PRELIMINARY TREATMENT AS YOU

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:55.724
CAN SEE HERE CONSISTING OF

01:14:55.791 --> 01:14:57.559
SCREENS AND GRIT REMOVAL

01:14:57.626 --> 01:15:00.696
REMOVES APPROXIMATELY 35259% OF

01:15:00.762 --> 01:15:03.966
THE MICROPLASTIC LOAD. PRIMARY

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:05.434
TREATMENT CONSISTING OF

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:06.802
DIFFERENT SKIMMING AND SETTLING

01:15:06.869 --> 01:15:09.338
PROCESS USE CAN REMOVE UP

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:13.375
25298% SECONDARY TREATMENT

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:14.476
WHICH CONSISTS OF MORE

01:15:14.543 --> 01:15:16.411
BIOLOGICAL TREATMENT CAN REMOVE

01:15:16.478 --> 01:15:20.148
UP 286299% OF THE MICROPLASTIC

01:15:20.215 --> 01:15:22.050
LOAD. AND FINALLY ADVANCED

01:15:22.117 --> 01:15:23.785
TERTIARY TREATMENTS CONSISTING

01:15:23.852 --> 01:15:25.020
OF DIFFERENT FILTRATION

01:15:25.087 --> 01:15:27.456
TECHNOLOGIES CAN REMOVE UP

01:15:27.522 --> 01:15:30.726
298299% SO THE TAKEAWAY HERE

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:31.860
REALLY IS THAT USING

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:33.061
CONVENTIONAL WASTEWATER

01:15:33.128 --> 01:15:34.696
TREATMENT TECHNOLOGIES WE ARE

01:15:34.763 --> 01:15:35.764
ABLE TO REMOVE THE VAST

01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:37.466
MAJORITY OF MICROPLASTICS FROM

01:15:37.532 --> 01:15:41.737
RAW SEWAGE. BUT AS DR COFFIN-

01:15:41.803 --> 01:15:43.572
SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER THE

01:15:43.639 --> 01:15:44.473
TREATMENT DOESN'T SIMPLY

01:15:44.539 --> 01:15:46.208
DESTROY MICROPLASTICS BUT

01:15:46.275 --> 01:15:47.676
TRANSFERS THEM TO THE SOLID

01:15:47.743 --> 01:15:51.380
TRACTION. SO SPECIFICALLY THOSE

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:53.782
REMOVED BY PRELIMINARY AND A

01:15:53.849 --> 01:15:54.483
SMALL PORTION OF PRIMARY

01:15:54.549 --> 01:15:57.419
TREATMENT ARE SENT TO LANDFILLS

01:15:57.486 --> 01:15:59.021
AND THE REMAINDER ARE

01:15:59.087 --> 01:16:00.522
TRANSFERRED TO SLUDGE WHICH IS

01:16:00.589 --> 01:16:02.891
FURTHER TREATED TO BECOME SAFE

01:16:02.958 --> 01:16:04.927
AND RELIABLE BIOSOLIDS. NO

01:16:04.993 --> 01:16:06.428
RESEARCH ON THE PREVALENCE AND

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:07.829
THE FATE AND TRANSPORT OF

01:16:07.896 --> 01:16:09.998
MICROPLASTICS IN BIOSOLIDS IS

01:16:10.065 --> 01:16:12.434
STILL IN THE EARLY PHASES WE DO

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:13.969
HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING BUT

01:16:14.036 --> 01:16:15.437
THERE ARE MANY DATA GAPS THAT I

01:16:15.504 --> 01:16:17.572
WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS BRIEFLY

01:16:17.639 --> 01:16:18.206
IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES OF THIS

01:16:18.273 --> 01:16:22.244
TALK. SO IN TERMS OF THE

01:16:22.311 --> 01:16:23.145
CHARACTERISTICS OF

01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:25.047
MICROPLASTICS IN WASTE WATER IN

01:16:25.113 --> 01:16:26.581
THE AFFLUENT. RESEARCH HAS

01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:28.450
SHOWN THAT THE MOST COMMON FORM

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:30.152
IS MICROPLASTICS AS YOU CAN SEE

01:16:30.218 --> 01:16:31.086
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS GRAPH

01:16:31.153 --> 01:16:33.555
HERE. FOLLOWED BY IRREGULARLY

01:16:33.622 --> 01:16:35.724
SHAPED FRAGMENTS WHICH OFTEN DO

01:16:35.791 --> 01:16:37.292
INCLUDE FILMS AND PHONES AS

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:39.628
WELL. NOW THIS TREND IS LIKELY

01:16:39.695 --> 01:16:41.229
A REFLECTION OF THE VAST NUMBER

01:16:41.296 --> 01:16:42.664
OF SYNTHETIC FIBERS THAT ARE

01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:44.633
RELEASED THROUGH BOTH DOMESTIC

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:45.567
AND COMMERCIAL LAUNDRY

01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:47.803
EFFLUENTS THAT ARE SENT TO

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:48.370
WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:50.339
EVERY DAY. BUT SOMETHING ELSE

01:16:50.405 --> 01:16:51.473
I'D LIKE TO NOTE HERE IS THE

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:53.408
INCREDIBLE SPREAD IN THE

01:16:53.475 --> 01:16:54.710
ESTIMATES YOU CAN SEE BETWEEN

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:56.378
ERROR BARS. WHICH HIGHLIGHTS

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:57.980
SOME OF THE UNCERTAINTY AND

01:16:58.046 --> 01:16:59.915
VARIABILITY IN THESE NUMBERS

01:16:59.982 --> 01:17:00.482
THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO BETTER

01:17:00.549 --> 01:17:06.221
UNDERSTAND. AND IN PRACTICE

01:17:06.288 --> 01:17:07.656
THERE'S AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF

01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:09.524
DIVERSITY AND MICROPLASTIC

01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:11.893
SHAPES AND COLORS AND SIZES.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:12.694
THAT CAN MAKE THEIR

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:13.929
IDENTIFICATION VERY

01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:16.431
CHALLENGING. SO THESE PHOTOS

01:17:16.498 --> 01:17:17.666
ARE HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM SOME

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:19.534
OF OUR WASTE WATER SAMPLES

01:17:19.601 --> 01:17:20.702
COLLECTED AT DIFFERENT

01:17:20.769 --> 01:17:22.637
TREATMENT LEVELS. AND THE GOAL

01:17:22.704 --> 01:17:23.805
HERE IS TO SHOW THAT OUR

01:17:23.872 --> 01:17:26.141
DEFINITION AND CHARACTERIZATION

01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:28.076
OF MICROPLASTICS ARE EVOLVING.

01:17:28.143 --> 01:17:30.379
FROM BRIGHTLY COLORED HARD

01:17:30.445 --> 01:17:33.382
FRAGMENTS OF PLASTIC TO. CLEAR

01:17:33.448 --> 01:17:35.917
AN ODDLY SHAPED PARTICLES TAN

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:37.919
COLORED PHONES AND MANY MANY

01:17:37.986 --> 01:17:40.022
DIFFERENT COMPLEX ADDITIVES AND

01:17:40.088 --> 01:17:45.794
FILLERS. SO NOW THAT I'VE

01:17:45.861 --> 01:17:47.329
DISCUSSED WHAT WE DO KNOW I

01:17:47.396 --> 01:17:48.897
WOULD LIKE TO TRANSITION TO THE

01:17:48.964 --> 01:17:49.698
CHALLENGES ON THE KNOWLEDGE

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:51.767
GAPS SURROUNDING MICRO PLASTICS

01:17:51.833 --> 01:17:53.668
AND WASTEWATER. IN OTHER WORDS

01:17:53.735 --> 01:17:55.537
WHAT DO WE NOT KNOW AND WHAT DO

01:17:55.604 --> 01:17:57.539
WE NEED TO DO BETTER. AND

01:17:57.606 --> 01:17:59.107
IMPORTANTLY WHAT ARE WE DOING

01:17:59.174 --> 01:18:01.076
NOW TO TACKLE THESE UNKNOWNS

01:18:01.143 --> 01:18:01.643
AND WHAT CAN BE DONE IN THE

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:07.482
FUTURE. SO THE FIRST MAJOR

01:18:07.549 --> 01:18:09.584
CHALLENGE IS REALLY RECONCILING

01:18:09.651 --> 01:18:11.153
THAT HIGH VARIABILITY THAT WE

01:18:11.219 --> 01:18:12.120
SEE IN THE SCIENTIFIC

01:18:12.187 --> 01:18:13.688
LITERATURE ON ESTIMATES OF

01:18:13.755 --> 01:18:15.524
MICROPLASTICS IN WASTE WATER.

01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:17.325
THIS VERY ABILITY COULD BE DUE

01:18:17.392 --> 01:18:18.693
TO MANY DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.262
WE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND

01:18:20.328 --> 01:18:22.064
BUT ONE OF THE MOST BASIC IS

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:23.331
THAT WE LACK COMMON AND

01:18:23.398 --> 01:18:25.233
STANDARD METHODS TO SAMPLE AND

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:27.636
MEASURE THESE CONTAMINANTS. AND

01:18:27.702 --> 01:18:28.170
ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE'RE

01:18:28.236 --> 01:18:29.304
TACKLING THIS IS THE

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:30.772
PARTICIPATION IN EFFORTS TO

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:33.141
DEVELOP. EVALUATE AND RECOMMEND

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:34.443
STANDARD METHODS FOR DIFFERENT

01:18:34.509 --> 01:18:36.978
SAMPLE TYPES. AND HEARD LIKE TO

01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:37.913
GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO THE

01:18:37.979 --> 01:18:39.748
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COASTAL

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:41.216
WATER RESEARCH PROJECT OR

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:43.685
SQUARE. THEY'VE REALLY BEEN

01:18:43.752 --> 01:18:44.152
LEADING THE EFFORT IN

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:46.488
CALIFORNIA. DR COFFIN TO

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:47.756
DESCRIBE THIS A LITTLE BIT

01:18:47.823 --> 01:18:49.591
EARLIER AND WE ARE JUST ONE OF

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:51.460
THE MANY LABORATORIES INVOLVED.

01:18:51.526 --> 01:18:52.861
THIS EFFORT IS CURRENTLY

01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:54.563
FOCUSED ON DRINKING WATER FOR

01:18:54.629 --> 01:18:57.132
SB FOURTEEN TWENTY TWO- AND

01:18:57.199 --> 01:18:58.667
DOES NOT INCLUDE SIMULATED

01:18:58.733 --> 01:19:01.036
WASTEWATER SAMPLES BUT WITH

01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:02.537
GREATER FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES

01:19:02.604 --> 01:19:03.638
AND REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:19:03.705 --> 01:19:05.407
STANDARDIZED METHODS WE COULD

01:19:05.474 --> 01:19:06.741
REALLY SOLIDIFIED INFORMED

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:08.710
RELIABLE ESTIMATES ACROSS

01:19:08.777 --> 01:19:10.245
SOURCES AND DIFFERENT PATHWAYS

01:19:10.312 --> 01:19:12.581
INCLUDING WASTEWATER AND

01:19:12.647 --> 01:19:17.352
BIOSOLIDS. A SECOND KNOWLEDGE

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:18.787
GAP HERE IS UNDERSTANDING HOW

01:19:18.854 --> 01:19:20.489
ALL OTHER FACTORS AFFECT THE

01:19:20.555 --> 01:19:22.157
PREVALENCE AND MICROPLASTICS IN

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:23.925
A WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:25.360
FROM THE PROPORTION OF

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:27.062
INDUSTRIAL INPUTS TO THE

01:19:27.129 --> 01:19:28.430
CONTRIBUTION OF STORM WATER

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:31.533
DIVERSIONS OR URBAN RUNOFF. AND

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.901
TO UNDERSTAND HOW ALL OF THESE

01:19:32.968 --> 01:19:34.836
DIFFERENT FACTORS AFFECT

01:19:34.903 --> 01:19:36.638
OVERALL REMOVAL FROM THIS

01:19:36.705 --> 01:19:38.840
PATHWAY TO THE ENVIRONMENT. NOW

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:40.375
TO TACKLE THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:41.877
THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL OR

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:44.479
OPC HAS RECENTLY FUNDED SQUARE

01:19:44.546 --> 01:19:46.381
UP TO CONDUCT A PRELIMINARY

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:47.215
STUDY TO ADDRESS THESE

01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:49.484
QUESTIONS. WE AT OC SAD ARE

01:19:49.551 --> 01:19:52.120
ENGAGED WITH KASA AND SEVERAL

01:19:52.187 --> 01:19:54.356
SISTER WASTE WATER AGENCIES AS

01:19:54.422 --> 01:19:56.691
PARTNERS ON THIS ENDEAVOR. AND

01:19:56.758 --> 01:19:58.260
TOGETHER WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS

01:19:58.326 --> 01:20:00.495
DEVELOPING HIGH QUALITY DATA TO

01:20:00.562 --> 01:20:01.596
INFORM RELIABLE REMOVAL

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:05.167
ESTIMATES OF MICROPLASTICS IN

01:20:05.233 --> 01:20:05.667
CALIFORNIA'S WASTEWATER

01:20:05.734 --> 01:20:11.206
TREATMENT PLANTS. SO THE FINAL

01:20:11.273 --> 01:20:12.507
BIG CHALLENGE THAT I'D LIKE TO

01:20:12.574 --> 01:20:14.209
MENTION IS THAT WE ARE STILL IN

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:15.343
THE EARLY STAGES OF

01:20:15.410 --> 01:20:16.845
UNDERSTANDING THE BIG PICTURE

01:20:16.912 --> 01:20:18.613
AND RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF

01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:20.482
ALL SOURCES AND PATHWAYS TO THE

01:20:20.549 --> 01:20:22.150
ENVIRONMENT. AND ONE OF THE

01:20:22.217 --> 01:20:24.085
CENTRAL DATA CAPS BUT I'D LIKE

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:25.420
TO HIGHLIGHT HERE IS THE FATE

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:27.455
OF MICROPLASTICS IN LAND APPLY

01:20:27.522 --> 01:20:29.724
BIOSOLIDS ESPECIALLY AS IT

01:20:29.791 --> 01:20:31.259
COMPARES TO OTHER AGRICULTURAL

01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:33.261
SOURCES SUCH AS THE USE OF

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:35.197
PLASTIC TARPS. I WHICH HAS

01:20:35.263 --> 01:20:36.598
BECOME QUITE COMMON FOR THE

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:38.266
CONTRIBUTION BY ATMOSPHERIC

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:39.834
DEPOSITION WHICH I BELIEVE WILL

01:20:39.901 --> 01:20:41.369
HEAR MORE ABOUT LATER ON IN

01:20:41.436 --> 01:20:43.271
THIS IN THE SECOND PANEL. THIS

01:20:43.338 --> 01:20:45.040
IS A MAJOR UNKNOWN AND WHILE

01:20:45.106 --> 01:20:46.541
TREATED BIOSOLIDS ARE ONLY

01:20:46.608 --> 01:20:48.109
CURRENTLY APPLY TO LESS THAN

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:49.244
ZERO POINT 5% OF ALL

01:20:49.311 --> 01:20:50.879
AGRICULTURAL LANDS IN

01:20:50.946 --> 01:20:52.881
CALIFORNIA. IS SOMETHING WE DO

01:20:52.948 --> 01:20:55.217
NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. TO

01:20:55.283 --> 01:20:56.418
TACKLE THESE QUESTIONS WE THINK

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:58.153
IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE HAVE

01:20:58.220 --> 01:20:59.487
THE METHODS IN PLACE TO

01:20:59.554 --> 01:21:00.622
CONFIDENTLY MEASURE THESE

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:02.891
CONTAMINANTS FROM ALL PATHWAYS.

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:08.663
USING HIGH QUALITY STUDIES. I'D

01:21:08.730 --> 01:21:10.966
LIKE TO CLOSE BY STRESSING THAT

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:12.500
WE CANNOT IGNORE SOURCE CONTROL

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:14.135
IS A KEY COMPONENT IN ITS

01:21:14.202 --> 01:21:16.304
EFFECTIVENESS AND ITS INFLUENCE

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:18.406
IN SOLVING THIS EMERGING ISSUE.

01:21:18.473 --> 01:21:20.408
AND THE BEST WAY REALLY IT IS

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:21.576
THE BEST WAY REALLY TO REDUCE

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:24.679
MICROPLASTICS- IS TO REDUCE OUR

01:21:24.746 --> 01:21:27.082
OUR USE OF PLASTIC OVERALL. WE

01:21:27.148 --> 01:21:29.017
ALSO NEED STANDARD VALIDATED

01:21:29.084 --> 01:21:30.685
AND ROBUST METHODS FOR

01:21:30.752 --> 01:21:31.953
WASTEWATER AND BIOSOLIDS

01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:33.855
SAMPLES. MOVEMENTS WE ARE MORE

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:35.390
CONFIDENT IN OUR METHODS WE CAN

01:21:35.457 --> 01:21:36.625
BE MORE CONFIDENT THAT WE'RE

01:21:36.691 --> 01:21:38.760
COMPARING APPLES TO APPLES. ARE

01:21:38.827 --> 01:21:40.795
FRAGMENTS TO PREGNANCY. AND

01:21:40.862 --> 01:21:41.963
FINALLY IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:43.365
SUPPORT AND PROMOTE

01:25:19.147 --> 01:25:22.050
MICROPLASTICS ARE FOR THE HUMAN

01:25:22.116 --> 01:25:23.985
HEALTH EFFECTS PANEL. YES AND

01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:27.188
I'LL SAY- IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL

COMMITTEE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:25:31.159 --> 01:25:32.727
LEGISLATION THAT WE ARE ALSO

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:35.029
LOOKING AT- INTERNATIONAL

01:25:35.096 --> 01:25:36.631
SOURCES OF INFORMATION

INCREDIBLY DEPRESSING BUT

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:53.748
INTERESTING SO THANK YOU FOR

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:55.850
ENLIGHTENING US TODAY. THE VAST

01:25:55.917 --> 01:25:56.951
PROBLEMS WERE FACING WHEN IT

01:25:57.018 --> 01:25:58.486
COMES TO MICROPLASTICS AND ONE

01:25:58.553 --> 01:26:01.556
QUESTION FOR I'M REBEKAH SUTTON

01:26:01.623 --> 01:26:03.992
IF WE COULD GET HER BACK. HOW

01:26:04.058 --> 01:26:07.595
THIS ALL WORKS BUT. YES I'M

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:10.031
HERE THANK YOU REBECCA AND SO

01:26:10.098 --> 01:26:13.635
DOCTORS AND YOU MENTIONED- HOW

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:15.203
MANY OF THE FIBERS IN THE SAN

01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:17.105
FRANCISCO BAY WERE RELATED TO

01:26:17.171 --> 01:26:20.341
RELEASE FROM TIRES- AND IT'S

01:26:20.408 --> 01:26:21.042
INTERESTING TO ME I HAD A

01:26:21.109 --> 01:26:23.144
CHANCE TO. CONVERSE WITH DR

01:26:23.211 --> 01:26:24.546
GRANT YESTERDAY WHO IS AT THE

01:26:24.612 --> 01:26:25.547
UNIVERSITY OF OREGON WHO'S DONE

01:26:25.613 --> 01:26:26.614
THE RESEARCH OFF THE COAST OF

01:26:26.681 --> 01:26:27.682
OREGON AND SHE SAID IT WAS A

01:26:27.749 --> 01:26:29.651
VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE. OF WHAT

01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:31.686
THEY FOUND IN THE CLAMS AND

01:26:31.753 --> 01:26:33.187
ANIMALS THEY LOOKED OUT IN

01:26:33.254 --> 01:26:34.322
OREGON SO I'M WONDERING WHY

01:26:34.389 --> 01:26:35.256
THERE WOULD BE SUCH A BIG

01:26:35.323 --> 01:26:36.257
DIFFERENCE ON THE SOURCE OF

01:26:36.324 --> 01:26:37.625
MICROPLASTICS HERE IN THE BAY

01:26:37.692 --> 01:26:38.927
AREA. FIRST IS WHAT WE'RE

01:26:38.993 --> 01:26:40.395
SEEING ELSEWHERE IS THAT AS A

01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:41.396
RESULT OF THE URBAN ENVIRONMENT

01:26:41.462 --> 01:26:43.298
OR WHAT. HAVE YOU LOOKED AT

01:26:43.364 --> 01:26:45.099
DIFFERENT STUDIES AND WHAT

01:26:45.166 --> 01:26:47.502
MICROPLASTICS ARE PRESENT AND

01:26:47.569 --> 01:26:48.002
WHAT MIGHT EXPLAIN THOSE

01:26:48.069 --> 01:26:50.138
DIFFERENCES. SURE YEAH THESE

01:26:50.204 --> 01:26:51.773
ARE IT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

01:26:51.839 --> 01:26:54.475
WE DIDN'T GENERALLY SEE FIBERS

01:26:54.542 --> 01:26:56.511
AND THE COUPLE SPECIES THAT WE

01:26:56.578 --> 01:26:59.213
EXAMINED. WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.648
TIRE PARTICLES WHERE WE OBSERVE

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:02.417
DOES WAS THE STORM WATER AS

01:27:02.483 --> 01:27:04.986
WELL AS THE SENTIMENT. NOW THEY

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:07.188
HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN.

01:27:07.255 --> 01:27:09.657
CHARLESTON I BELIEVE IN IN FISH

01:27:09.724 --> 01:27:12.126
SO THERE ARE NOW OBSERVATIONS

01:27:12.193 --> 01:27:13.962
OF TIRE PARTICLES IN SOME

01:27:14.028 --> 01:27:16.331
SPECIES AND I SUSPECT WE JUST

01:27:16.397 --> 01:27:18.499
DID NOT PICK THE RIGHT SPECIES

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:20.501
THAT WOULD BE CONSUMING THE

01:27:20.568 --> 01:27:22.570
TIRE ARTICLE SO WE MAY HAVE

01:27:22.637 --> 01:27:25.139
PICKED. SPECIES THAT CONSUMES

01:27:25.206 --> 01:27:27.609
MORE TYPICAL TYPES OF

01:27:27.675 --> 01:27:29.410
MICROPLASTICS RATHER THAN SLAP

01:27:29.477 --> 01:27:33.348
OUT. OR WERE. SENTENCED

01:27:33.414 --> 01:27:36.618
ORIENTED TOWARD. THAT TIRE

01:27:36.684 --> 01:27:39.153
SHAPED PARTICLES. THANK YOU AND

01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:39.988
THEN I HAD ANOTHER QUESTION

01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:41.589
WHICH IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:27:41.656 --> 01:27:43.458
THE PREVALENCE OF THIS IN OUR-

01:27:43.524 --> 01:27:45.693
A. WATERS AND THAT ORGANISMS IN

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.795
OUR- WATERS BUT- I DIDN'T HEAR

01:27:47.862 --> 01:27:48.630
ANYONE MENTIONING THE

01:27:48.696 --> 01:27:49.697
PREVALENCE OF THIS IN OUR

01:27:49.764 --> 01:27:51.499
DRINKING WATER. WHICH I IMAGINE

01:27:51.566 --> 01:27:53.101
COULD ALSO BE THE CASE GIVE ANY

01:27:53.167 --> 01:27:56.070
INSIGHT INTO THAT. WE DID NOT

01:27:56.137 --> 01:27:57.105
EXAMINE DRINKING WATER IN OUR

01:27:57.171 --> 01:27:58.806
STUDY BUT I BELIEVE DOCTOR

01:27:58.873 --> 01:28:01.476
COFFIN COULD SPEAK TO THAT.

01:28:01.542 --> 01:28:05.747
PROFIT ARE WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO

01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:07.281
MONITORING DATA FOR DRINKING

01:28:07.348 --> 01:28:09.651
WATER IN CALIFORNIA AND TO BE

01:28:09.717 --> 01:28:10.952
QUITE HONEST THERE'S REALLY

01:28:11.019 --> 01:28:12.253
ONLY A HANDFUL STUDIES THAT

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:13.321
I'VE EVER LOOKED AT

01:28:13.388 --> 01:28:14.188
MICROPLASTICS IN DRINKING

01:28:14.255 --> 01:28:17.258
WATER- THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED.

01:28:17.325 --> 01:28:19.594
BUT WE WILL BE MONITORING- THIS

01:28:19.661 --> 01:28:21.396
LATER THIS YEAR AS WE ADOPT OUR

01:28:21.462 --> 01:28:22.730
FOUR YEARS SIMPLY ANALYSIS PLAN

01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:24.699
BY JULY FIRST. THANK YOU IT

01:28:24.766 --> 01:28:26.434
SEEMS LIKE WE NEED SOME DATA ON

01:28:26.501 --> 01:28:27.502
THAT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S BEING

01:28:27.568 --> 01:28:28.903
CONSUMED BY OUR CONSTITUENTS

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:31.005
EVERY DAY SO. NEED TO MAKE SURE

01:28:31.072 --> 01:28:31.839
THERE ARE NOT A SIGNIFICANT

01:28:31.906 --> 01:28:34.175
SORT OF REASON- ALTHOUGH WE

01:28:34.242 --> 01:28:36.010
WERE LOOKING HERE AT THE BAY.

01:28:36.077 --> 01:28:38.813
AND DR SUTTON'S PAPER THAT

01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:40.915
AGAIN MANY OFFERS ON THAT AND

01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:42.750
LOTS OF CONTRIBUTORS INCLUDING

01:28:42.817 --> 01:28:44.819
FORMER SCIENCE FELLOW OF MINE

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:48.556
DI&lt;c.cyan&gt; A LAND. VERY PROUD OF-&lt;/c&gt;

01:28:48.623 --> 01:28:52.126
WE LOOKED AT THIS BECAUSE- IT

01:28:52.193 --> 01:28:54.696
SHOWED HOW IN AN URBAN AREA YOU

01:28:54.762 --> 01:28:58.599
COULD GET POLLUTION INTO WATER-

01:28:58.666 --> 01:29:00.034
SINCE THERE ISN'T A COMPARABLE

01:29:00.101 --> 01:29:01.836
STUDY INTO WHAT GETS INTO THE

01:29:01.903 --> 01:29:03.871
SAN JOAQUIN OR THE SACRAMENTO

01:29:03.938 --> 01:29:06.774
RIVER. I REALLY HAD TO RELY ON

01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:08.609
THIS WHICH I THINK IS JUST AN

01:29:08.676 --> 01:29:10.078
INDICATION I MEAN WE OFFER HAD

01:29:10.144 --> 01:29:12.213
TIRES. AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:15.183
YOU BUT I ALWAYS SORT OF NEVER

01:29:15.249 --> 01:29:16.417
CARED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WAS

01:29:16.484 --> 01:29:19.954
MY- TIRES WHERE GAP. NOW I KNOW

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:22.523
IT HAPPENS IT GETS CAUGHT UP IN

01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:24.425
STORM WATER GOES INTO THE- INTO

01:29:24.492 --> 01:29:27.929
THE LAKES AND RIVERS AND BAYS

01:29:27.995 --> 01:29:30.264
OF- CALIFORNIA. AND THAT'S

01:29:30.331 --> 01:29:32.066
SOMETHING PARTICULARLY NOW THAT

01:29:32.133 --> 01:29:34.001
WE'VE IDENTIFIED A TOXIC

01:29:34.068 --> 01:29:37.071
SUBSTANCE. I JUST CAN'T THINK

01:29:37.138 --> 01:29:38.339
OF ANYTHING THAT'S MORE

01:29:38.406 --> 01:29:41.275
IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW THERE AND-

01:29:41.342 --> 01:29:42.977
THEN THIS WORK THAT HAS BEEN

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:46.047
DONE BY THE ESTUARY INSTITUTED.

01:29:46.114 --> 01:29:49.684
REALLY REVEALED A LOT- YES

01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:51.552
CENTER BALANCE. YEAH I MEAN ON

01:29:51.619 --> 01:29:53.488
THAT NOTE AND THERE'S ALSO AN

01:29:53.554 --> 01:29:55.723
ENORMOUS PROBLEM ASSOCIATE

01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:57.291
WHICH I GUESS IS NOT

01:29:57.358 --> 01:29:57.892
TECHNICALLY A MICROPLASTIC BY

01:29:57.959 --> 01:30:00.328
ZINC. IS AN IMPORTANT

01:30:00.394 --> 01:30:02.430
INGREDIENT IN TIRES AND IT'S

01:30:02.497 --> 01:30:04.232
ACTUALLY CAUSING ENORMOUS.

01:30:04.298 --> 01:30:05.767
CLEAN WATER ACT LIABILITY

01:30:05.833 --> 01:30:06.868
CHALLENGES FOR A LOT OF OUR

01:30:06.934 --> 01:30:09.103
CITIES I KNOW I'VE GOT TO SIT

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:09.737
IN MY DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE IT'S

01:30:09.804 --> 01:30:11.506
GOT. YOU KNOW TWENTY FIVE

01:30:11.572 --> 01:30:12.340
MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL BUDGET

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:13.574
THE TUNER FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR

01:30:13.641 --> 01:30:14.842
LIABILITY OF THE CLEAN WATER

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:16.177
ACT AND SOME OF IT LOOKS OF

01:30:16.244 --> 01:30:17.812
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THAT.

01:30:17.879 --> 01:30:20.548
HAS TO DO WITH ZINC I RUNOFF.

01:30:20.615 --> 01:30:22.617
AND YOU KNOW WE'VE WE SPELL

01:30:22.683 --> 01:30:24.786
TIME LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE. I'M

01:30:24.852 --> 01:30:26.220
TRYING TO SEE THIS AND SOLICIT

01:30:26.287 --> 01:30:26.821
A FIX I THINK THAT THE ONE OF

01:30:26.888 --> 01:30:28.756
THE CHALLENGES THAT. FOLKS IN

01:30:28.823 --> 01:30:30.458
THE IN THE- TIRE INDUSTRY

01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:32.226
RUBBER INDUSTRY IT'S A TRIBE

01:30:32.293 --> 01:30:34.295
AND COME BACK TO US AND SAID

01:30:34.362 --> 01:30:36.597
THERE'S NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVES-

01:30:36.664 --> 01:30:37.565
TO TAKE CARE OF WHAT THINK

01:30:37.632 --> 01:30:39.133
TAKES CARE OF IN TERMS OF THE

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.836
FUNCTIONALITY OF A TIRE- BUT- I

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:43.538
WOULD. I GUESS I'D LOVE TO.

01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:45.106
THAT MAY POSE THE QUESTION THE

01:30:45.173 --> 01:30:46.774
PAST MAYBE THE SECOND ONE BUT

01:30:46.841 --> 01:30:47.975
BUT- I THINK ALL THE PARENTS

01:30:48.042 --> 01:30:48.943
COULD PROBABLY SPEAK THIS I'D

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:52.180
LOVE TO. DIGITAL DEEPER ON ON.

01:30:52.246 --> 01:30:54.148
OUR END- ANTI POLLUTION IN WHAT

01:30:54.215 --> 01:30:56.617
SORT OF WHAT INFORMATION YOU'VE

01:30:56.684 --> 01:30:57.418
GOTTEN FROM OTHER.

01:30:57.485 --> 01:31:00.488
JURISDICTIONS WITH REGARDS TO-

01:31:00.555 --> 01:31:01.989
PREVENTING TIRE RELATED

01:31:02.056 --> 01:31:03.124
POLLUTION WHETHER BE ON THE ON

01:31:03.191 --> 01:31:04.492
THE MICROPLASTIC SIDE OR IN THE

01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:06.727
SINK SIDE. ARE THERE ANY BEST

01:31:06.794 --> 01:31:08.229
PRACTICES OUT THERE- IN OTHER

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:09.497
PARTS OF THE WORLD OTHER PARTS

01:31:09.564 --> 01:31:11.098
OF THE COUNTRY THAT WE OUGHT TO

01:31:11.165 --> 01:31:14.368
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION. AS ARE

01:31:14.435 --> 01:31:14.836
TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS

01:31:14.902 --> 01:31:15.670
PARTICULAR PART OF THE PROBLEM.

01:31:15.736 --> 01:31:17.939
DR KAUFMAN PERHAPS YOU COULD-

01:31:18.005 --> 01:31:24.712
GO INTO THAT. BOB OBSOLETE AND

01:31:24.779 --> 01:31:27.048
THIS ONE TO DOCTOR SUTTON

01:31:27.114 --> 01:31:29.283
ACTUALLY DO A BETTER JOB. DR

01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:33.187
SUTTON. SURE SO WHAT I AM VERY

01:31:33.254 --> 01:31:34.889
EXCITED TO SEE WHAT COMES OF

01:31:34.956 --> 01:31:36.057
THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC

01:31:36.123 --> 01:31:38.059
SUBSTANCES CONTROLS SAFER

01:31:38.125 --> 01:31:39.327
CONSUMER PRODUCTS EFFORT WHEN

01:31:39.393 --> 01:31:41.062
IT COMES TO TIRES BECAUSE THAT

01:31:41.128 --> 01:31:42.763
IS ACTUALLY PRIMARILY FOCUSED

01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:45.433
ON ZINC AND THIS NEWARK MORE

01:31:45.499 --> 01:31:48.002
NEWLY IDENTIFIED PRESERVATIVES

01:31:48.069 --> 01:31:50.404
IT'S TOXIC TO THE COLORADO IT

01:31:50.471 --> 01:31:51.339
IT'S A NEWER ISSUES SO THEY'RE

01:31:51.405 --> 01:31:53.708
GONNA HOPEFULLY EXAMINE BOTH OF

01:31:53.774 --> 01:31:55.643
THESE TOXIC INGREDIENTS IN

01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:57.345
TIRES. AND SEE IF THERE ARE

01:31:57.411 --> 01:32:00.848
WAYS TO REFORMULATE ARTIST THIS

01:32:00.915 --> 01:32:02.416
IS A SORT OF IT THE PROCESS

01:32:02.483 --> 01:32:04.085
ISN'T AN ONGOING CONVERSATION

01:32:04.151 --> 01:32:06.921
WITH MANUFACTURERS WHERE. THE

01:32:06.988 --> 01:32:10.224
AGENCY CHALLENGES THEM TO

01:32:10.291 --> 01:32:13.761
DETERMINE. WHETHER THERE MAY BE

01:32:13.828 --> 01:32:14.528
SAFER ALTERNATIVES- BUT DO YOU

01:32:14.595 --> 01:32:18.566
KNOW OF I PROJECT- PLAN I HAD

01:32:18.633 --> 01:32:19.634
AND BETTER CARE WHAT I DO I

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:21.102
FORGOT TO MENTION TO ME I DO

01:32:21.168 --> 01:32:23.504
APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS

01:32:23.571 --> 01:32:25.706
INVITATION- AS- TO THIS IS VERY

01:32:25.773 --> 01:32:28.242
INTERESTING HEARING- DID YOU

01:32:28.309 --> 01:32:31.379
KNOW OF. OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS

01:32:31.445 --> 01:32:33.080
AROUND THE COUNTRY OF THE WORLD

01:32:33.147 --> 01:32:35.883
THAT HAVE. BEEN DOING BETTER

01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:38.252
WORK IN THIS AREA THAT WE OUT

01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:42.890
OF LEARN FROM MORE KNOW ABOUT.

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:44.825
WELL THAT THE RESEARCH TEAM

01:32:44.892 --> 01:32:46.961
THAT WORKED ON THIS-

01:32:47.028 --> 01:32:48.562
PRESERVATIVE CHEMICALS BASED IN

01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:50.364
WASHINGTON STATE AND THAT

01:32:50.431 --> 01:32:52.366
THEY'VE BEEN EXAMINING TIRES

01:32:52.433 --> 01:32:53.768
LARGELY BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A

01:32:53.834 --> 01:32:55.503
LOT OF RESTORATION TO BRING

01:32:55.569 --> 01:32:57.204
CALL CALL BACK TO THE STREAMS

01:32:57.271 --> 01:32:59.840
AND IN SOME CASES THE STREAMS.

01:32:59.907 --> 01:33:01.342
HAVE NOT BEEN HOSPITABLE

01:33:01.409 --> 01:33:02.677
THERE'S BEEN THIS REALLY ACUTE

01:33:02.743 --> 01:33:04.245
TOXIC REACTION AFTER STORM

01:33:04.312 --> 01:33:05.813
EVENTS THAT'S BECAUSE THE CO

01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:07.748
HOSTED TO DIE WITHIN HOURS OF

01:33:07.815 --> 01:33:09.784
TIME EXPOSURE TO THIS ASSET TO

01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:11.986
STORMWATER RUNOFF FROM ST LARGE

01:33:12.053 --> 01:33:14.155
HIGHWAYS AND MAJOR ROADWAYS. SO

01:33:14.221 --> 01:33:15.423
I WOULD SAY FOR THE

01:33:15.489 --> 01:33:19.093
CONSULTATION WITH THAT FOLKS IN

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:19.694
THE STATE OF WASHINGTON MIGHT

01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.128
BE. GOOD WEIGHT AND SAID GET

01:33:21.195 --> 01:33:23.097
MORE CONVERSATION ABOUT BEST

01:33:23.164 --> 01:33:24.932
PRACTICES MOVING FORWARD OKAY

01:33:24.999 --> 01:33:26.133
SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE THEY'VE

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:26.934
COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF

01:33:27.001 --> 01:33:28.169
PRESERVATIVE CHEMICAL THAT

01:33:28.235 --> 01:33:30.271
MIMICS THE BENEFITS BENEFITS OF

01:33:30.338 --> 01:33:32.139
ZINC. THAT IS POTENTIALLY A

01:33:32.206 --> 01:33:34.508
BETTER ALTERNATIVE IS THAT JUST

01:33:34.575 --> 01:33:36.010
YOU KNOW IT UNFORTUNATELY IT

01:33:36.077 --> 01:33:37.345
DOESN'T MIMIC THE BENEFIT IT'S

01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:39.013
AN ADDITIONAL PROBLEM SO I

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:40.781
THINK THE PROBLEM AND THEN ALSO

01:33:40.848 --> 01:33:41.749
THIS PRESERVATIVE IS A NEW

01:33:41.816 --> 01:33:42.917
PROBLEM THAT YOU JUST

01:33:42.984 --> 01:33:45.319
IDENTIFIED. SO NOW WE'RE NOW

01:33:45.386 --> 01:33:46.988
WILL GET BACK TO PROBLEMS. OKAY

01:33:47.054 --> 01:33:51.525
SO WE DON'T. SO. SO THERE ISN'T

01:33:51.592 --> 01:33:52.393
EFFECTIVE ANYTHING IT JUST. I

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:53.427
WAS HOPING FOR SOME HELP BUT I

01:33:53.494 --> 01:33:54.929
GUESS YEARS YEAH YOU GIVE ME

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:56.731
LESS HOPE. WITH YOUR ANSWER BUT

01:33:56.797 --> 01:34:00.601
IT'S- PROBABLY. I CAN'T SAY IT

01:34:00.668 --> 01:34:01.369
SO SEEMS ESPECIALLY WHERE

01:34:01.435 --> 01:34:02.937
INSTITUTE I WAS INVOLVED WITH

01:34:03.004 --> 01:34:05.206
THIS WITH ONE STUDY THAT IS A

01:34:05.272 --> 01:34:08.042
BIT HOPEFUL IN TERMS OF.

01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:09.110
EXAMINING GREEN STORMWATER

01:34:09.176 --> 01:34:11.412
INFRASTRUCTURE OR A RAIN GARDEN

01:34:11.479 --> 01:34:13.214
AND I THINK ONE OF THE LATER

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:15.249
SPEAKERS WILL TALK ABOUT THIS

01:34:15.316 --> 01:34:18.486
MORE. FULLY BUT I BASICALLY IF

01:34:18.552 --> 01:34:20.287
YOU PASSED IF YOU PASSED ON

01:34:20.354 --> 01:34:21.722
WATER THROUGH A RAIN GARDEN.

01:34:21.789 --> 01:34:23.491
THEN I DON'T THAT CAN FILTER

01:34:23.557 --> 01:34:25.526
OUT SOME OF THE PARTICLES

01:34:25.593 --> 01:34:27.828
RIGHT. RIGHT SO WE DIDN'T ONE

01:34:27.895 --> 01:34:29.697
SMALL STUDY IN A RAIN GARDEN IN

01:34:29.764 --> 01:34:32.366
THE BAY AREA AND WE ARE ABOUT

01:34:32.433 --> 01:34:33.467
TO START CONNECTING MORE ROBUST

01:34:33.534 --> 01:34:34.468
STUDY IN THE CITY OF SAN

01:34:34.535 --> 01:34:36.270
FRANCISCO. SO THIS IS ONE KIND

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:37.304
OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICE

01:34:37.371 --> 01:34:40.908
THAT COULD BE USEFUL FOR. BOTH

01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:42.877
PARTICLES AND THE CHEMICALS

01:34:42.943 --> 01:34:46.213
ASSOCIATED. WITH THESE

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:47.014
PARTICLES BUT THAT. SCIENCE IS

01:34:47.081 --> 01:34:50.217
STILL. SO I DON'T WANT TO.

01:34:50.284 --> 01:34:52.153
EXAGGERATE THE EFFICACY OF THIS

01:34:52.219 --> 01:34:54.021
AFTER AT THIS TIME IT'S ALSO

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:55.689
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT- MISTER

01:34:55.756 --> 01:34:57.892
MORNING FOR STRUCTURE IS IT CAN

01:34:57.958 --> 01:34:59.727
BE QUITE COSTLY SO IT CAN BE

01:34:59.794 --> 01:35:01.562
MORE EFFECTIVE IF WE CAN.

01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:03.264
ADDRESS THESE CONTAMINANTS AT

01:35:03.330 --> 01:35:05.699
THE SOURCE YOU KNOW REDUCE USE

01:35:05.766 --> 01:35:07.735
REFORMULATION OR RATHER THAN

01:35:07.802 --> 01:35:09.103
CATCHING THEM FURTHER

01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:10.805
DOWNSTREAM WELL LET ME ASK ALL

01:35:10.871 --> 01:35:12.073
THE PANELISTS THAT YOU'RE JUST

01:35:12.139 --> 01:35:13.541
AS I THINK YOU HIT ON THE ISSUE

01:35:13.607 --> 01:35:16.343
RIGHT A MANY SO WHAT HOW HOW

01:35:16.410 --> 01:35:18.312
MUCH PROGRESS WE MAKING ON

01:35:18.379 --> 01:35:18.913
REALLY IDENTIFYING THE LARGEST

01:35:18.979 --> 01:35:20.915
CONTRIBUTORS. I WE DO WE JUST

01:35:20.981 --> 01:35:22.016
TALK ABOUT TIRES YOU KNOW

01:35:22.083 --> 01:35:23.117
PRESUMABLY CLOSE PLAY AN

01:35:23.184 --> 01:35:25.386
IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE LEAST A

01:35:25.453 --> 01:35:27.588
LOT OF THE MICROFIBERS THAT

01:35:27.655 --> 01:35:29.490
WERE MENTIONED. AB YOU KNOW SO

01:35:29.557 --> 01:35:31.492
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE EFFORTS

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:33.127
UNDER WAY TO REALLY HELP US

01:35:33.194 --> 01:35:35.362
UNDERSTAND WHERE. THE PROBLEM

01:35:35.429 --> 01:35:37.832
IS ON THE SOURCE SIDE. AND THEN

01:35:37.898 --> 01:35:39.700
ONCE AGAIN I YOU KNOW. IS THERE

01:35:39.767 --> 01:35:41.769
ANY GOOD EXAMPLES OUT THERE AND

01:35:41.836 --> 01:35:44.338
IN OTHER PLACES- OF FOLKS WHO

01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:45.539
HAVE FIGURED OUT A GOOD WAY OF

01:35:45.606 --> 01:35:46.507
ADDRESSING THIS I MEAN IS

01:35:46.574 --> 01:35:50.244
THERE. AND NO. WAY TO ATTEMPT

01:35:50.311 --> 01:35:52.580
TO TRY TO PUSH MANUFACTURERS TO

01:35:52.646 --> 01:35:54.915
BE MORE RESPONSIBLE YOU KNOW TO

01:35:54.982 --> 01:35:56.784
HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE- FOR

01:35:56.851 --> 01:36:01.422
ACOSTA THEIR ULTIMATELY-

01:36:01.489 --> 01:36:02.056
PUSHING OFF ON TO THE ON TO THE

01:36:02.123 --> 01:36:06.026
GENERAL PUBLIC. I'M TO SPEAK

01:36:06.093 --> 01:36:08.295
BRIEFLY I DON'T WANT TO TAKE.

01:36:08.362 --> 01:36:10.498
TAKE TIME FROM MY CO PRESENTERS

01:36:10.564 --> 01:36:14.135
BUT- I THINK THE FACT IT. FOR

01:36:14.201 --> 01:36:16.537
EXAMPLE DOCTOR KAUFMAN'S WORK

01:36:16.604 --> 01:36:18.606
ON A DEFINITION AND ON MESSAGE

01:36:18.672 --> 01:36:20.741
IS LEADING ACTUALLY THE WHOLE

01:36:20.808 --> 01:36:22.776
WORLD IN SOME WAYS THAT. THAT

01:36:22.843 --> 01:36:23.777
CALIFORNIA'S REALLY OUT IN

01:36:23.844 --> 01:36:27.781
FRONT ON THIS ISSUE. SO AT.

01:36:27.848 --> 01:36:29.383
THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO BE

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:33.888
LEADERS I SUPPOSE I. ON THIS ON.

01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:35.956
INTERESTING MICROPLASTICS.

01:36:36.023 --> 01:36:39.693
THANK YOU SENATOR- AND I ALSO

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:42.396
HAVE A QUESTION FOR- DOCTOR

01:36:42.463 --> 01:36:46.433
SUTTON- SO IS THERE ANY

01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:49.203
INDICATION OF. PLASTICS COMING

01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:51.972
FROM OUR LANDFILLS I KNOW THAT-

01:36:52.039 --> 01:36:53.440
IN THE SOUTH PART OF ALAMEDA

01:36:53.507 --> 01:36:55.643
COUNTY YOU DO HAVE A LANDFILL

01:36:55.709 --> 01:36:57.278
RIGHT NEXT TO THE BAG. ANY

01:36:57.344 --> 01:36:58.612
INDICATION THAT WE GET LEAKAGE

01:36:58.679 --> 01:37:02.216
FROM THE LANDFILLS INTO THE DAY

01:37:02.283 --> 01:37:06.921
IN TERMS OF PLASTICS. I AM NOT

01:37:06.987 --> 01:37:09.290
AWARE OF ANY CALIFORNIA

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:11.926
SPECIFIC SCIENCE ON THAT I DO

01:37:11.992 --> 01:37:13.894
KNOW THAT THERE ARE STUDIES.

01:37:13.961 --> 01:37:15.396
ELSEWHERE THAT HAVE OBSERVE

01:37:15.462 --> 01:37:16.931
MICRO PLASTICS IN LANDFILL

01:37:16.997 --> 01:37:20.234
LEACHATE. I BELIEVE LEACHATE.

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:21.902
IS TREAT IT DOESN'T IS NOT

01:37:21.969 --> 01:37:25.172
SUPPOSED TO. EXIT POLLING AND

01:37:25.239 --> 01:37:26.473
FEELING GOING TO THE BANK-

01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:29.210
PERHAPS OTHERS. MORE ON THIS OR

01:37:29.276 --> 01:37:31.212
FROM IF THE REGULATIONS ARE

01:37:31.278 --> 01:37:35.049
WORKING THERE G. R. PLASTICS

01:37:35.115 --> 01:37:37.418
COMING FROM THE LANDFILL SO

01:37:37.484 --> 01:37:40.120
THESE PRESUMABLY THAT AND-

01:37:40.187 --> 01:37:42.723
WHAT'S GETTING IN THE PLASTICS

01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:44.391
THE SOURCES FIRST OF ALL TIRES.

01:37:44.458 --> 01:37:46.427
THE LEAST IN THE BAY AREA THAT

01:37:46.493 --> 01:37:48.128
WAS THE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR.

01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:51.765
AND THEN PROBABLY LATER ILLEGAL

01:37:51.832 --> 01:37:55.035
DUMPING- WHAT DO YOU THINK THEY

01:37:55.102 --> 01:37:56.904
CAN RELATED TO THE QUESTION

01:37:56.971 --> 01:37:59.039
SEVERAL RALLY BROUGHT UP. WHAT

01:37:59.106 --> 01:38:00.841
IS IT WE NEED TO CONTROL TO

01:38:00.908 --> 01:38:05.179
KEEP OUR STORMWATER- MORE FEWER

01:38:05.246 --> 01:38:07.414
OTHER THAN THE TIRES. SH WELL

01:38:07.481 --> 01:38:09.149
THE OTHER THING BESIDES TIRES

01:38:09.216 --> 01:38:11.151
IN OUR STORM WATER WERE FIBERS

01:38:11.218 --> 01:38:12.653
IN SO SOME OF THOSE FARMERS

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:13.454
COULD BE DERIVED FROM OUR

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:16.590
CLOTHING. AND ONE PATHWAY FOR

01:38:16.657 --> 01:38:17.658
THEM TO GET OUT INTO THE

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:19.393
LANDSCAPE COULD BE FOR EXAMPLE

01:38:19.460 --> 01:38:22.730
OUR DRYER VENTS. AND ANOTHER

01:38:22.796 --> 01:38:24.632
TYPE OF FIBER WE SAW OUR THAT

01:38:24.698 --> 01:38:25.966
THE ONES ASSOCIATED WITH

01:38:26.033 --> 01:38:27.568
CIGARETTES SO THAT CELLULOSE

01:38:27.635 --> 01:38:29.737
ACETATE. SO THAT COULD BE

01:38:29.803 --> 01:38:33.407
ANOTHER TYPE OF SPECIFIC SOURCE

01:38:33.474 --> 01:38:36.110
THAT THAT ONE COULD ADDRESS AT

01:38:36.176 --> 01:38:38.946
IN TERMS OF REDUCING STORMWATER

01:38:39.013 --> 01:38:43.317
YES MA'AM. I LIKE THE IDEA BUT-

01:38:43.384 --> 01:38:45.052
YEAH I BELIEVE IT WAS ONE OF

01:38:45.119 --> 01:38:47.388
THE TOPICS OF THE OPC THEIR

01:38:47.454 --> 01:38:49.089
THEIR DRAFT TOP TEN LIST OF

01:38:49.156 --> 01:38:52.660
WAYS TO ADDRESS. COULD YOU GET

01:38:52.726 --> 01:38:55.529
THAT REPORT TO- ARE COMMITTEE

01:38:55.596 --> 01:38:58.399
MEMBERS ARE THE DRAFT REPORT TO

01:38:58.465 --> 01:38:59.233
OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS WELL

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:02.303
AS- SENATORS ALLEN AND STERN

01:39:02.369 --> 01:39:07.641
AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER. LUIS RIVAS.

01:39:07.708 --> 01:39:11.045
SO OKAY- I THINK IN THE- I

01:39:11.111 --> 01:39:12.479
THINK WE CAN NOW GO ON TO THE

01:39:12.546 --> 01:39:15.449
NEXT PANEL. THANK YOU ALL SO

01:39:15.516 --> 01:39:21.188
MUCH- THIS IS TRULY BEYOND- FOR

01:39:21.255 --> 01:39:24.692
ME- WILL HAVE A LIFE CHANGING.

01:39:24.758 --> 01:39:32.132
THANK YOU ALL RIGHT.

01:39:32.199 --> 01:39:34.068
RESEARCHERS ABOUT WHAT IS KNOWN

01:39:34.134 --> 01:39:36.170
ABOUT THE IMPACT MIKE CARTER

01:39:36.236 --> 01:39:37.438
FROM THE ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING

01:39:37.504 --> 01:39:40.174
AQUATIC LIFE FROM ECOSYSTEMS

01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:42.242
AND HOW MIGHT THEY CURRENTLY

01:39:42.309 --> 01:39:45.746
BEING DIRECTLY. INTERFERING

01:39:45.813 --> 01:39:47.981
WITH HUMAN HEALTH- I'VE HEARD

01:39:48.048 --> 01:39:50.918
RIGHT- GRANT S. BRONTE

01:39:50.984 --> 01:39:52.786
PROFESSOR IN THE STATE

01:39:52.853 --> 01:39:55.289
UNIVERSITY- TO DISCUSS YOUR

01:39:55.356 --> 01:39:56.957
GROUND BREAKING RESEARCH ON THE

01:39:57.024 --> 01:39:58.992
ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION OF

01:39:59.059 --> 01:40:03.263
MICROPLASTIC IN REMOTE AREAS

01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:05.032
UNITED STATES. AGAIN IF YOU CAN

01:40:05.099 --> 01:40:06.867
YOUR QUESTIONS TO REMEMBER

01:40:06.934 --> 01:40:10.337
PANELS AND- YOU FIVE TO SEVEN

01:40:10.404 --> 01:40:12.139
MINUTES FOR YOUR PRESENTATION

01:40:12.206 --> 01:40:15.609
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH DR

01:40:15.676 --> 01:40:17.344
QUIRK AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

01:40:17.411 --> 01:40:18.445
INVITING ME TO BE A PART OF

01:40:18.512 --> 01:40:19.980
THIS IMPORTANT PANEL REALLY

01:40:20.047 --> 01:40:22.149
EXCITED TO BE HERE. SO I'D LIKE

01:40:22.216 --> 01:40:24.251
TO START OFF BY- ACKNOWLEDGING

01:40:24.318 --> 01:40:26.353
THAT LESS THAN A DOZEN PAPERS

01:40:26.420 --> 01:40:27.354
HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED ON THIS

01:40:27.421 --> 01:40:29.523
TOPIC IN THE LAST FEW YEARS SO

01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:30.791
WE'RE REALLY AT THE VERY START

01:40:30.858 --> 01:40:32.559
OF UNDERSTANDING HOW PLASTICS

01:40:32.626 --> 01:40:34.228
ARE EMITTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE

01:40:34.294 --> 01:40:35.162
AND TRANSPORTED TO THE

01:40:35.229 --> 01:40:37.531
ATMOSPHERE. WE ALSO DON'T HAVE

01:40:37.598 --> 01:40:39.133
ANY INFORMATION ON NATIONAL

01:40:39.199 --> 01:40:40.968
PLASTICS SO WHEN I SAY NANO

01:40:41.034 --> 01:40:42.236
PLASTICS I'M TALKING ABOUT

01:40:42.302 --> 01:40:44.138
PARTICLES THAT ARE SMALLER THAN

01:40:44.204 --> 01:40:45.539
ONE MICROMETER AND FOR

01:40:45.606 --> 01:40:47.040
REFERENCE A RED BLOOD CELL

01:40:47.107 --> 01:40:48.675
SALAS ABOUT TEN MICROMETERS

01:40:48.742 --> 01:40:50.411
THESE ARE VERY VERY SMALL

01:40:50.477 --> 01:40:51.612
PARTICLES AND THEY WOULD HAVE

01:40:51.678 --> 01:40:53.680
DIFFERENT EMISSION POINTS. AND

01:40:53.747 --> 01:40:54.681
TRANSPORT PATHWAYS AND

01:40:54.748 --> 01:40:58.185
MICROPLASTICS. I'M GONNA STICK

01:40:58.252 --> 01:41:01.255
TO MICROPLASTICS HERE. SO WHAT

01:41:01.321 --> 01:41:02.189
DO WE KNO ABOUT HOW

01:41:02.256 --> 01:41:03.290
MICROPLASTICS ENTERING THE

01:41:03.357 --> 01:41:05.626
ATMOSPHERE AS WE'VE HEARD.

01:41:05.692 --> 01:41:07.761
PLASTICS ARE VERY PERSISTENT SO

01:41:07.828 --> 01:41:09.029
THEY IN THE ENVIRONMENT THEY

01:41:09.096 --> 01:41:10.330
WILL RESIST ALL FORMS OF

01:41:10.397 --> 01:41:12.633
NATURAL TO KAY. INSTEAD

01:41:12.699 --> 01:41:14.168
BREAKING APART INTO SMALLER AND

01:41:14.234 --> 01:41:15.936
SMALLER PARTICLES UNTIL FINALLY

01:41:16.003 --> 01:41:17.838
THEY'RE SMALL ENOUGH TO BE

01:41:17.905 --> 01:41:21.742
TRANSPORTED BY THE WIND. SO

01:41:21.809 --> 01:41:23.944
SIMILAR TO SOIL DUST

01:41:24.011 --> 01:41:25.145
MICROPLASTICS NEED TO BE

01:41:25.212 --> 01:41:26.480
ADMITTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE

01:41:26.547 --> 01:41:29.316
THROUGH SOME. PHYSICAL

01:41:29.383 --> 01:41:32.519
MECHANICAL PROCESS. UNLIKE SOIL

01:41:32.586 --> 01:41:33.954
DUST HOWEVER MICROPLASTICS ARE

01:41:34.021 --> 01:41:35.656
A LOT LESS DANCE SO THAT MEANS

01:41:35.722 --> 01:41:36.590
THAT THEY CAN TRAVEL MUCH

01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:39.793
FARTHER IN A MUCH LARGER SIZES.

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:40.794
BUT WE CAN USE OUR

01:41:40.861 --> 01:41:42.663
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SOIL DUST

01:41:42.729 --> 01:41:43.764
IS EMITTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE

01:41:43.831 --> 01:41:45.532
AND OTHER AEROSOLES TO CREATE

01:41:45.599 --> 01:41:48.602
HYPOTHESES ON HOW MICROPLASTICS

01:41:48.669 --> 01:41:49.069
MIGHT BE ENTERING THE

01:41:49.136 --> 01:41:51.538
ATMOSPHERE. SO VERY LIKELY

01:41:51.605 --> 01:41:52.973
SOURCE ARE IS THE MARINE

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:54.074
ENVIRONMENT YOU KNOW THERE'S A

01:41:54.141 --> 01:41:55.709
LOT OF PLASTICS IN THE OCEAN

01:41:55.776 --> 01:41:57.544
STATE TAX THERE ARE OFTEN LESS

01:41:57.611 --> 01:41:59.346
DENSE THAN WATER. STILL BUBBLE

01:41:59.413 --> 01:42:01.248
BURST ACTION AND WAVE ACTION

01:42:01.315 --> 01:42:02.983
COULD BE AT I WANTED MECHANISM

01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:04.284
THAT MICROPLASTICS ARE BEING

01:42:04.351 --> 01:42:07.721
ADMITTED. TO THE ATMOSPHERE.

01:42:07.788 --> 01:42:09.623
ANOTHER LIKELY MAJOR SOURCES

01:42:09.690 --> 01:42:11.859
ROADS THE ROADS ARE LONG AND

01:42:11.925 --> 01:42:13.627
WHEN YOU'RE IN THAT PROVIDES AN

01:42:13.694 --> 01:42:15.762
UNOBSTRUCTED PATH FOR A WIN.

01:42:15.829 --> 01:42:18.632
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY ROADS AT

01:42:18.699 --> 01:42:20.000
CARS DRIVING ON THE ROADS

01:42:20.067 --> 01:42:22.069
PROVIDES MECHANICAL ENERGY TO A

01:42:22.135 --> 01:42:23.904
MINUTE PARTICLES HIGH INTO THE

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:26.073
ATMOSPHERE. THIS ISN'T JUST THE

01:42:26.139 --> 01:42:27.508
TIRE WEAR PARTICLES IN THE

01:42:27.574 --> 01:42:29.443
ROBERT PARTICLES WHICH ARE PART

01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:30.377
OF THIS BUT ALSO ANY

01:42:30.444 --> 01:42:32.045
MICROPLASTIC FROM A VARIETY OF

01:42:32.112 --> 01:42:34.681
DIFFERENT COMMODITIES THAT

01:42:34.748 --> 01:42:37.518
COULD BE IN THAT ROAD TAX. AS

01:42:37.584 --> 01:42:39.152
WE'VE HEARD AGRICULTURE COULD

01:42:39.219 --> 01:42:40.387
BE A REALLY IMPORTANT SOURCE TO

01:42:40.454 --> 01:42:42.122
THE ATMOSPHERE NOT JUST FROM

01:42:42.189 --> 01:42:44.124
BIOSOLIDS APPLICATION BUT ALSO

01:42:44.191 --> 01:42:46.894
FROM PLASTIC MOLDS AND PLASTIC.

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.862
TARPS THAT ARE ADDED TO AND

01:42:48.929 --> 01:42:50.163
USED IN THE AGRICULTURAL

01:42:50.230 --> 01:42:52.833
PRACTICES- AND STUDIES HAVE

01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:53.967
SHOWN THAT CLASSICS ARE

01:42:54.034 --> 01:42:55.636
PREFERENTIALLY WINNOWED FROM

01:42:55.702 --> 01:42:58.238
THE SOILS AS COMPARED TO

01:42:58.305 --> 01:43:01.875
SWELLED PAST. AB POPULATION IS

01:43:01.942 --> 01:43:03.610
A LITTLE BIT OF A STRANGE TERM

01:43:03.677 --> 01:43:04.811
BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT HOW

01:43:04.878 --> 01:43:07.180
PEOPLE ARE REALLY EFFECTIVE AT

01:43:07.247 --> 01:43:07.948
MOVING STAND AWAY FROM THE

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:10.117
BEACH HUMANS ARE ALSO LIKELY

01:43:10.183 --> 01:43:11.852
REALLY EFFECTIVE AT REMOVING

01:43:11.919 --> 01:43:13.654
MICROPLASTICS AWAY FROM SEATS.

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.589
SO ANY AREAS ON THE EARTH THAT

01:43:15.656 --> 01:43:17.124
PRODUCED A LOT OF DUST THAT

01:43:17.190 --> 01:43:18.892
HAPPENED TO BE NEAR. LARGE

01:43:18.959 --> 01:43:20.894
URBAN CENTERS HAVE THE CAPACITY

01:43:20.961 --> 01:43:23.263
TO MOVE PLASTICS INTO THE

01:43:23.330 --> 01:43:25.899
ATMOSPHERE. AND THEN ONCE WE

01:43:25.966 --> 01:43:27.534
HAVE CITIES AND CITIES IS WHERE

01:43:27.601 --> 01:43:29.002
A LOT OF OUR PLASTIC WASTE IS

01:43:29.069 --> 01:43:30.837
GENERATED. BUT IT MAY NOT

01:43:30.904 --> 01:43:32.573
NECESSARILY BE WHERE PLASTICS

01:43:32.639 --> 01:43:33.974
ARE EMITTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE

01:43:34.041 --> 01:43:35.609
SECURING DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN

01:43:35.676 --> 01:43:37.411
SOURCES TO THE ENVIRONMENT AND

01:43:37.477 --> 01:43:39.279
SOURCES TO THE ATMOSPHERE. SO

01:43:39.346 --> 01:43:41.515
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT DUST IF FOR

01:43:41.582 --> 01:43:43.951
EXAMPLE IS THAT CITIES PRODUCE

01:43:44.017 --> 01:43:46.119
A LOT OF DOT OFTEN EIGHT AND AT

01:43:46.186 --> 01:43:47.788
IN ORDER TO. MANAGE YOU TO

01:43:47.854 --> 01:43:49.856
ORDER OF MAGNITUDE MORE THAN

01:43:49.923 --> 01:43:51.158
CHASING RURAL OR REMOTE

01:43:51.224 --> 01:43:53.026
LOCATIONS. THIS IS BECAUSE

01:43:53.093 --> 01:43:54.061
THESE ARE PRODUCING A LOT OF

01:43:54.127 --> 01:43:55.662
DUST BUT IT'S NOT MOVING HIGH

01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:59.566
INTO THE ATMOSPHERE SO. IT'S

01:43:59.633 --> 01:44:00.133
NOT GETTING TRANSPORTED VERY

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:03.203
FAR. SO IN TERMS OF HOW

01:44:03.270 --> 01:44:04.805
MICROPLASTICS IS TRANSPORTED

01:44:04.871 --> 01:44:06.607
THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE WHERE IT

01:44:06.673 --> 01:44:08.041
IS IN THE ATMOSPHERE HOW FAR IS

01:44:08.108 --> 01:44:10.243
TRACK IT'S BEING TRANSPORTED-

01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:11.745
WE'RE REALLY JUST STARTING TO

01:44:11.812 --> 01:44:12.379
SCRATCH THE SURFACE THAT THAT

01:44:12.446 --> 01:44:13.747
QUESTION AS WELL AS IF YOU'RE

01:44:13.814 --> 01:44:15.682
GONNA TALK ABOUT THE STUDY-

01:44:15.749 --> 01:44:16.850
THAT I CONDUCTED. AND I WAS

01:44:16.917 --> 01:44:18.018
REALLY ONLY ABLE TO START

01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:19.486
ADDRESSING THESE QUESTIONS

01:44:19.553 --> 01:44:20.754
BECAUSE I CAPITALIZE ON AN

01:44:20.821 --> 01:44:22.889
EXISTING NETWORK. I DEVELOPED A

01:44:22.956 --> 01:44:24.257
SAMPLER THAT COULD WORK WITH

01:44:24.324 --> 01:44:25.325
THE NATIONAL ATMOSPHERIC

01:44:25.392 --> 01:44:27.094
DEPOSITION PROGRAM THAT ALLOWED

01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:29.896
ME TO SAMPLE. BOTH WHITES AND

01:44:29.963 --> 01:44:31.698
DRY DEPOSITION SO WHAT IS WHAT

01:44:31.765 --> 01:44:33.133
FALLS OUT WITH THE BRAIN. AND

01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:34.901
DRIES WHAT FALLS OUT UNDER DRY

01:44:34.968 --> 01:44:37.037
CONDITIONS AND I WAS ABLE TO DO

01:44:37.104 --> 01:44:39.473
THIS AND- REALLY- HIGH TEMPORAL

01:44:39.539 --> 01:44:41.742
RESOLUTION WEEKLY FOR RAIN. IF

01:44:41.808 --> 01:44:45.979
IT RAINS AND LUCKY FOR DRY. AND

01:44:46.046 --> 01:44:47.014
WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WHITE

01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:48.849
DEPOSITION WAS REALLY DIFFERENT

01:44:48.915 --> 01:44:50.450
AND DRY. SO WHAT THE POSITION

01:44:50.517 --> 01:44:52.519
TENDED TO BE SOURCED FOR MORE

01:44:52.586 --> 01:44:54.955
NEARBY LOCATIONS SO IF IT AIR

01:44:55.022 --> 01:44:56.423
MASS PASSED THROUGH IT AND

01:44:56.490 --> 01:44:58.025
URBAN CENTER WE SAW MORE

01:44:58.091 --> 01:45:00.160
PLASTIC OR IF IT HAD A LOT OF.

01:45:00.227 --> 01:45:02.462
SOIL DUST IN IT. AND WHAT WE

01:45:02.529 --> 01:45:04.197
THINK IS HAPPENING HERE IS THAT

01:45:04.264 --> 01:45:05.565
AS STOREFRONTS MOVE THROUGH AN

01:45:05.632 --> 01:45:06.733
AREA THEY GENERATE A LOT OF

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:08.502
PLANS AND A LOT OF ENERGY THAT

01:45:08.568 --> 01:45:10.604
CAN. PICK UP A LOT OF TACTICS

01:45:10.671 --> 01:45:12.105
OFF THE GROUND WHICH CAN THEN

01:45:12.172 --> 01:45:14.608
BE. RAINED OUT IN THAT STORE.

01:45:14.675 --> 01:45:15.909
AND SOON I KNOW I JUST SAID

01:45:15.976 --> 01:45:17.778
THAT WE DON'T THINK CITIES ARE

01:45:17.844 --> 01:45:19.780
A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR. SO

01:45:19.846 --> 01:45:21.615
I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT-

01:45:21.682 --> 01:45:24.351
CITIES. ALSO HAVE A LOT OF ROAD

01:45:24.418 --> 01:45:25.185
NETWORK NETWORKS COMING IN AND

01:45:25.252 --> 01:45:27.120
OUT OF THAT. BUT ALSO WE WERE

01:45:27.187 --> 01:45:29.656
ONLY ABLE TO ASCRIBE ABOUT 10%

01:45:29.723 --> 01:45:31.725
OF OUR DEPOSITION TO CITIES AND

01:45:31.792 --> 01:45:33.660
THIS IS BECAUSE 80% OF OUR

01:45:33.727 --> 01:45:37.798
DEPOSITION CAME OUT. AS DRY

01:45:37.864 --> 01:45:39.700
DEPOSITION. SO DRIED UP AS- OUT.

01:45:39.766 --> 01:45:41.401
VERY DE. IT WAS MUCH SMALLER IN

01:45:41.468 --> 01:45:44.471
SIZE. IT WAS INVERSELY RELATED

01:45:44.538 --> 01:45:46.239
TO SOIL DUST SO THE LAST OIL

01:45:46.306 --> 01:45:47.607
DESK THAT WAS IN OUR SAMPLE

01:45:47.674 --> 01:45:49.476
SOME MORE PLASTICS THE STOCK.

01:45:49.543 --> 01:45:50.877
AND WE ALSO SAW A STRONG

01:45:50.944 --> 01:45:52.813
RELATIONSHIP TO ELEVATION SO

01:45:52.879 --> 01:45:54.614
THE HIGHER OUR SAMPLE SITES

01:45:54.681 --> 01:45:55.849
WHERE THE MORE CLASS THAT WE

01:45:55.916 --> 01:45:58.819
SAW. AND THEN FINALLY- ARE THE

01:45:58.885 --> 01:46:01.354
PLASTIC DEPOSITION RATE. WAYS

01:46:01.421 --> 01:46:03.123
WAS CORRELATED TO THESE BROAD

01:46:03.190 --> 01:46:04.825
CLIMATE SCALE PATTERNS LIKE THE

01:46:04.891 --> 01:46:06.727
LOCATION OF THE JET ST. SO IF

01:46:06.793 --> 01:46:08.328
THE JET STREAM. REALLY FAR

01:46:08.395 --> 01:46:10.130
SOUTH. AND INTERSECTED WITH

01:46:10.197 --> 01:46:11.932
THEIR SITES AS IS IN THIS IMAGE

01:46:11.998 --> 01:46:14.134
HERE WE SAW MORE PLASTIC. AND

01:46:14.201 --> 01:46:15.235
SO WHAT THIS IS TELLING US IS

01:46:15.302 --> 01:46:16.670
THAT PLASTICS ARE MOVING AROUND

01:46:16.737 --> 01:46:18.472
HIGH IN THE IN THE ATMOSPHERE

01:46:18.538 --> 01:46:20.140
COLUMN. AND THEY'RE INFLUENCED

01:46:20.207 --> 01:46:21.608
BY THESE BROAD SCALE PATTERNS

01:46:21.675 --> 01:46:26.346
MEANING THAT. THEY'RE BEING

01:46:26.413 --> 01:46:27.614
TRANSPORTED VERY FAR. SO TERMS

01:46:27.681 --> 01:46:30.117
OF TIME DEBRIS. RATES AGAIN WE

01:46:30.183 --> 01:46:31.551
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DATA AS TO

01:46:31.618 --> 01:46:32.619
WHAT'S BEEN PUBLISHED AS SHOWN

01:46:32.686 --> 01:46:34.488
HERE. AND WHAT YOU CAN SEE IS

01:46:34.554 --> 01:46:35.856
THAT THE DEPOSITION RATES

01:46:35.922 --> 01:46:37.691
WITHIN URBAN CENTRES ARE ONLY

01:46:37.758 --> 01:46:40.026
SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN WHAT WE'VE

01:46:40.093 --> 01:46:41.928
QUANTIFIED IN REMOTE LOCATIONS.

01:46:41.995 --> 01:46:43.029
AND SO THIS IS A LITTLE BIT

01:46:43.096 --> 01:46:44.498
CONCERNING BECAUSE IT SUGGESTS

01:46:44.564 --> 01:46:45.599
TO US THAT A LOT OF THE

01:46:45.665 --> 01:46:47.033
ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION OF

01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:49.703
PLASTICS IS DERIVED FROM LEGACY

01:46:49.770 --> 01:46:52.672
POLLUTION. SO IF WE DID A

01:46:52.739 --> 01:46:54.908
LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO WHAT WE

01:46:54.975 --> 01:46:56.042
ACTUALLY FOUND IT WITHIN OUR

01:46:56.109 --> 01:46:59.613
SAMPLES. ROUGHLY 226% OF THE

01:46:59.679 --> 01:47:01.148
SAMPLES WE ANALYZED WERE

01:47:01.214 --> 01:47:03.316
COMPOSED OF PLASTIC I'M JUST

01:47:03.383 --> 01:47:05.485
INCLUDED DOMINANTLY FIBERS BUT

01:47:05.552 --> 01:47:07.788
ALSO- MICROBEADS AS WELL A A

01:47:07.854 --> 01:47:10.157
VARIETY OF OTHER DIFFERENT-

01:47:10.223 --> 01:47:12.125
TYPES OF PLASTIC LAKE ROAD

01:47:12.192 --> 01:47:14.594
TIGHT. IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE A

01:47:14.661 --> 01:47:17.230
SMALL NUMBER 226% BUT IN FACT

01:47:17.297 --> 01:47:19.132
THIS IS A VERY LARGE AMOUNT OF

01:47:19.199 --> 01:47:22.068
MATERIAL. LOOKING AT OUR

01:47:22.135 --> 01:47:23.503
DEPOSITION RATES ACROSS THE

01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:27.140
AMERICAN WEST WE SAW BETWEEN

01:47:27.207 --> 01:47:27.707
FORTY EIGHT AND FOUR HUNDRED

01:47:27.774 --> 01:47:29.810
AND THIRTY FIVE. PIECES OF

01:47:29.876 --> 01:47:32.679
PLASTIC BEING DEPOSITED EVERY

01:47:32.746 --> 01:47:34.648
METER SQUARE EVERY SINGLE DAY.

01:47:34.714 --> 01:47:36.383
SO WE'VE WE SCALE THIS UP TO

01:47:36.449 --> 01:47:37.784
THE SIZE OF THE PROTECTED AREAS

01:47:37.851 --> 01:47:39.319
WE WERE STUDYING THIS

01:47:39.386 --> 01:47:41.955
TRANSLATED TO POINT YOU TO

01:47:42.022 --> 01:47:43.623
TWELVE TONS OF PLASTIC PER YEAR

01:47:43.690 --> 01:47:45.625
WITHIN THE SITES. AND THEN IF

01:47:45.692 --> 01:47:48.195
WE CONSIDER THE- PROTECTED

01:47:48.261 --> 01:47:50.797
AREAS IN ELEVEN WESTERN STATES

01:47:50.864 --> 01:47:51.965
THAT THIS IS A DARK GREEN AND

01:47:52.032 --> 01:47:54.034
LIGHT GREEN AREAS WE ESTIMATED

01:47:54.100 --> 01:47:55.969
THAT BETWEEN A THOUSAND AND

01:47:56.036 --> 01:47:58.438
FOUR THOUSAND TONS ARE BEING

01:47:58.505 --> 01:48:00.540
DEPOSITED EVERY SINGLE YEAR. SO

01:48:00.607 --> 01:48:01.842
AGAIN I WOULD LIKE TO INTEGRATE

01:48:01.908 --> 01:48:03.410
THAT WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING

01:48:03.476 --> 01:48:05.078
ABOUT MANTA PLASTICS AT THIS

01:48:05.145 --> 01:48:06.413
POINT SO THERE'S STILL A LOT OF

01:48:06.479 --> 01:48:08.882
QUESTIONS. I'M A LOT MORE

01:48:08.949 --> 01:48:09.649
QUESTIONS AND WE HAVE ANSWERS

01:48:09.716 --> 01:48:11.852
TO- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

01:48:11.918 --> 01:48:13.553
YOUR TIME AND I'LL ANSWER

01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:14.120
QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE

01:48:14.187 --> 01:48:16.857
PEOPLE. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANKS

01:48:16.923 --> 01:48:23.129
VERY MUCH- IT'S HARD TO SEE

01:48:23.196 --> 01:48:24.664
WHAT KIND OF SOLUTION WE CAN

01:48:24.731 --> 01:48:26.833
HAVE TO THIS OTHER THAN BANNING

01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:28.168
PLASTICS BUT WE'LL GET INTO

01:48:28.235 --> 01:48:31.738
THAT LATER- SO THE NEXT SPEAKER

01:48:31.805 --> 01:48:35.575
IS. PART OF OUR INTERNATIONAL-

01:48:35.642 --> 01:48:39.312
DAY TODAY- DR CHELSEA ROCKMAN

01:48:39.379 --> 01:48:41.548
FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO

01:48:41.615 --> 01:48:42.749
TO EXPLAIN MICROPLASTIC

01:48:42.816 --> 01:48:45.485
PATHWAYS IN AQUATIC ECO SYSTEMS

01:48:45.552 --> 01:48:47.721
AND KNOWN IMPACTS TO MARINE

01:48:47.787 --> 01:48:52.058
LIFE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAN

01:48:52.125 --> 01:48:54.728
YOU HEAR ME OK YEAH. OKAY

01:48:54.794 --> 01:48:56.096
WONDERFUL WELL THANK YOU DR

01:48:56.162 --> 01:48:57.530
CHAIRMAN AND OTHER MEMBERS OF

01:48:57.597 --> 01:48:59.599
THE COMMITTEE I'M I'M THRILLED

01:48:59.666 --> 01:49:01.434
TO BE HERE TODAY YES I'M IN IN

01:49:01.501 --> 01:49:03.236
CANADA BUT I SPEND A LOT OF

01:49:03.303 --> 01:49:05.438
YEARS AND I CALIFORNIA. AND THE

01:49:05.505 --> 01:49:07.040
NAME IS DR CHELSEA ROCK MAN I'M

01:49:07.107 --> 01:49:08.241
A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY

01:49:08.308 --> 01:49:10.277
OF TORONTO AND I'VE BEEN

01:49:10.343 --> 01:49:11.311
WORKING ON THE ISSUE OF PLASTIC

01:49:11.378 --> 01:49:12.412
POLLUTION FOR MORE THAN A

01:49:12.479 --> 01:49:14.614
DECADE- WHICH INCLUDES MANY

01:49:14.681 --> 01:49:16.883
YEARS I'M IN CALIFORNIA AND I

01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:20.153
CONTINUE TO WORK. IN CALIFORNIA

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:21.454
TODAY. AND YES IF YOU'RE

01:49:21.521 --> 01:49:22.689
WEATHER. SO I'M GONNA TALK

01:49:22.756 --> 01:49:23.823
TODAY ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH

01:49:23.890 --> 01:49:29.729
MICROPLASTICS CAN IMPACT. OTHER

01:49:29.796 --> 01:49:31.765
SPEAKERS THAT CONTAMINATION IS

01:49:31.831 --> 01:49:33.934
WIDESPREAD. THIS IS NO LONGER A

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.468
QUESTION THAT WE'RE GRAPPLING

01:49:35.535 --> 01:49:37.537
WITH IN THE FIELD. AND WE'RE

01:49:37.604 --> 01:49:39.773
STARTING TO UNDERSTAND THAT

01:49:39.839 --> 01:49:41.841
THIS WIDESPREAD CONTAMINATION

01:49:41.908 --> 01:49:43.843
HAS LED TO CONTAMINATION AT

01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:45.946
EVERY LEVEL OF THE FOOD CHAIN

01:49:46.012 --> 01:49:47.814
THIS INCLUDES IN PRIMARY

01:49:47.881 --> 01:49:49.683
PRODUCTIVITY WITH PLANTS- WE

01:49:49.749 --> 01:49:52.118
HAVE CONTAMINATION. AS WELL ALL

01:49:52.185 --> 01:49:54.154
THE WAY UP TO APEX PREDATORS

01:49:54.220 --> 01:49:56.823
LIKE SHARKS. SOMETIMES THE

01:49:56.890 --> 01:49:58.325
CONTAMINATION IS QUITE

01:49:58.391 --> 01:50:00.760
STRIKINGLY LARGE SO I WE HAVE

01:50:00.827 --> 01:50:02.495
FOUND NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN

01:50:02.562 --> 01:50:04.297
PARTICLES IN ONE BROWN BOWL HAD

01:50:04.364 --> 01:50:06.199
FISH HERE IN THE TORONTO AREA

01:50:06.266 --> 01:50:08.535
IN LAKE ONTARIO. AND DR THOMAS

01:50:08.601 --> 01:50:10.503
MAYES REPORTED ALMOST FOUR

01:50:10.570 --> 01:50:12.839
THOUSAND PARTICLES IN A SPECIES

01:50:12.906 --> 01:50:14.541
OF SHARK. SO WE KNOW THE

01:50:14.607 --> 01:50:15.909
CONTAMINATION IS OCCURRING AND

01:50:15.976 --> 01:50:16.943
WE'RE EVEN STARTING TO

01:50:17.010 --> 01:50:19.212
UNDERSTAND HOW THE CLASSIC MOVE

01:50:19.279 --> 01:50:20.780
AROUND A FOOD WET WHEN THEY

01:50:20.847 --> 01:50:24.484
CONTAMINATE- ORGANISMS IN IN.

01:50:24.551 --> 01:50:26.052
THE ENVIRONMENT WE KNOW THAT

01:50:26.119 --> 01:50:27.854
THESE ARE THESE PLASTICS CAN BE

01:50:27.921 --> 01:50:29.923
INGESTED WE'RE ALSO STARTING TO

01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:31.658
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY CAN BE

01:50:31.725 --> 01:50:33.159
INHALED THIS WOULD BE THROUGH

01:50:33.226 --> 01:50:35.295
THE GILLS OF FISH. WE CAN TALK

01:50:35.362 --> 01:50:37.130
ABOUT HUMAN HEALTH LATER-

01:50:37.197 --> 01:50:39.099
ANSWER STAFF STUFF RIGHT WILL

01:50:39.165 --> 01:50:41.668
DO THAT- WE KNOW THAT IT CAN BE

01:50:41.735 --> 01:50:43.136
IT CAN BE YOU JUST AND THERE

01:50:43.203 --> 01:50:45.839
CAN BE EXCRETION. I PLASTIC CAN

01:50:45.905 --> 01:50:47.540
TRANSFER FROM A PARADE TO A

01:50:47.607 --> 01:50:50.710
PREDATOR THROUGH TRAFFIC

01:50:50.777 --> 01:50:51.344
TRANSFERRED. BUT WE'RE ASKING

01:50:51.411 --> 01:50:52.879
ABOUT NOW IS TRYING INTEREST

01:50:52.946 --> 01:50:56.483
THAT. INCREASE OVER TIME IN

01:50:56.549 --> 01:50:57.851
CONCENTRATION OUTSIDE OF THE

01:50:57.917 --> 01:51:00.487
GUY IN THE TISSUES. AND DOESN'T

01:51:00.553 --> 01:51:02.555
INCREASE THE FOOD. I

01:51:02.622 --> 01:51:05.325
CONCENTRATION WAVER SYSTEM LIKE

01:51:05.392 --> 01:51:06.893
POLLUTANTS DEAL. THIS IS STILL

01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:08.528
QUESTION WE AREN'T SURE

01:51:08.595 --> 01:51:09.596
ACTUALLY I'M NOT SURE I THINK

01:51:09.662 --> 01:51:11.031
MY HYPOTHESIS WOULD BE THAT IT

01:51:11.097 --> 01:51:12.465
DOESN'T INCREASE. IN

01:51:12.532 --> 01:51:14.234
CONCENTRATION OF THE FOOD WEB.

01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:15.235
BUT WE KNOW THEY CAN'T

01:51:15.301 --> 01:51:17.537
CONCENTRATE OUTSIDE THE CAT AND

01:51:17.604 --> 01:51:19.205
THERE'S EVIDENCE OF CLASSIC IN

01:51:19.272 --> 01:51:20.673
THE FLAT IN THE LIVERS OF FISH

01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:22.776
TISSUE. AND FOR A WHILE THIS

01:51:22.842 --> 01:51:25.478
WAS HARD TO BELIEVE- BUT WE'VE

01:51:25.545 --> 01:51:26.946
EVEN FOUND IN FISH THAT WE'VE

01:51:27.013 --> 01:51:28.681
SAMPLED IN OUR OWN LAB SO THE

01:51:28.748 --> 01:51:29.983
ONLY THING I WANT YOU TO NOTICE

01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:31.551
FROM THIS GRAPH. IS THAT THE

01:51:31.618 --> 01:51:33.620
ORANGE IN THE PURPLE BOXES-

01:51:33.686 --> 01:51:35.455
THOSE BOX PLOTS ARE EVIDENCE OF

01:51:35.522 --> 01:51:37.624
MICROPLASTICS IN THE FILLET AND

01:51:37.690 --> 01:51:39.192
IN THE LIVER OF SPORT FISH

01:51:39.259 --> 01:51:41.594
TAKEN FROM LAKE SIMCOE. AT HERE

01:51:41.661 --> 01:51:43.797
IN ONTARIO AND THE GREEN IS THE

01:51:43.863 --> 01:51:45.665
MICROPLASTIC IN THE GOT YOU CAN

01:51:45.732 --> 01:51:47.033
SEE THAT OF COURSE THE

01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:48.201
MICROPLASTIC IN THE GUT WAS

01:51:48.268 --> 01:51:49.869
MORE ABUNDANT. BUT THAT WE WERE

01:51:49.936 --> 01:51:55.475
SEEING. THIS EVIDENCE IN THE

01:51:55.542 --> 01:51:56.509
FLAG. AND IN THE LIVER WHICH

01:51:56.576 --> 01:51:58.778
WAS QUITE. SO THIS LEADS TO THE-

01:51:58.845 --> 01:52:00.146
WHAT ARE THE IMPACT. HOW DOES

01:52:00.213 --> 01:52:02.682
THAT IN IN- AFFECT WILDLIFE.

01:52:02.749 --> 01:52:03.516
WHEN IT ENDS IN THE IN. AND

01:52:03.583 --> 01:52:05.251
THERE'S THREE SORT OF OVER

01:52:05.318 --> 01:52:07.187
ARCHING MECHANISMS I WILL SPEAK

01:52:07.253 --> 01:52:09.756
UP. AND ONE IS PHYSICAL WHEN A

01:52:09.823 --> 01:52:11.591
MICROPLASTIC LEADS THE GUY THAT

01:52:11.658 --> 01:52:13.660
GOES INTO AN ORGAN GOES INTO A

01:52:13.726 --> 01:52:15.228
TISSUE. IT CAN BE A SOURCE OF

01:52:15.295 --> 01:52:16.596
INFORMATION WHICH COULD

01:52:16.663 --> 01:52:19.766
EVENTUALLY INTENTIONALLY LEAD

01:52:19.833 --> 01:52:21.134
TO TUMOR FORMATION. ALSO WE'VE

01:52:21.201 --> 01:52:22.936
SEEN IN FISH THAT ARE EXPOSED

01:52:23.002 --> 01:52:24.737
TO MICROPLASTICS IN A TANK IN

01:52:24.804 --> 01:52:26.606
THE LAB. BECAUSE THEY START

01:52:26.673 --> 01:52:27.974
EATING LESS OF THEIR FOOD AND

01:52:28.041 --> 01:52:28.975
THEY START EATING MORE OF THE

01:52:29.042 --> 01:52:30.910
PLASTIC THAT PHYSICAL PRESENCE

01:52:30.977 --> 01:52:32.579
OF PLASTIC IN THE WATER CAN

01:52:32.645 --> 01:52:33.279
CAUSE A THREE DAY MISSION A

01:52:33.346 --> 01:52:36.282
FACT. WHICH CAN LEAD TO AN

01:52:36.349 --> 01:52:38.118
INCREASE IN MORTALITY OR DEATH.

01:52:38.184 --> 01:52:40.753
YOU CAN ALSO HAVE A CHEMICAL

01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:42.188
BACK DR SUTTON WAS TALKING

01:52:42.255 --> 01:52:43.890
ABOUT THIS WITH THE CHEMICALS

01:52:43.957 --> 01:52:45.859
AND TIRED ASKED. WE SEE THAT

01:52:45.925 --> 01:52:48.361
FATHEAD MINNOW A CRAYFISH LOSE

01:52:48.428 --> 01:52:49.596
THAT PIGMENTATION IN THEIR

01:52:49.662 --> 01:52:51.865
EYES. WHEN THEY'RE EXPOSED TO

01:52:51.931 --> 01:52:53.399
THE LEACHATE FROM TIRED TASK

01:52:53.466 --> 01:52:54.434
WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW

01:52:54.501 --> 01:52:56.503
THIS IMPACTS THEM AS THEY AS

01:52:56.569 --> 01:52:58.037
THEY GET OLDER. AND SAYS

01:52:58.104 --> 01:52:59.506
POTENTIALLY A SIMILAR STORY TO

01:52:59.572 --> 01:53:00.974
THE SALMON. THERE'S ALSO

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:02.375
EVIDENCE THAT WHEN PEOPLE

01:53:02.442 --> 01:53:04.444
EXPOSE MICROPLASTICS ORGANISMS

01:53:04.511 --> 01:53:06.279
IN THE LABS THAT ITS THE

01:53:06.346 --> 01:53:07.313
ADDITIVES THAT ARE CAUSING THE

01:53:07.380 --> 01:53:09.849
TOXICITY THIS IS A- CASE

01:53:09.916 --> 01:53:13.686
WITHOUT C. ELEGANS AS A WORD IN

01:53:13.753 --> 01:53:16.456
SO I'LL- MAKER. ALSO THE IN BY

01:53:16.523 --> 01:53:18.825
AND OF TRANSFORM INTO THESE

01:53:18.892 --> 01:53:20.693
MULTIPLE STRESSORS WHERE THEY

01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.762
START TO ACCUMULATE THE METALS

01:53:22.829 --> 01:53:23.863
AND THE PERSISTENT ORGANIC

01:53:23.930 --> 01:53:25.064
POLLUTANTS FROM THE WATER

01:53:25.131 --> 01:53:27.100
COLIN. THEY MIGHT EVEN GAIN A

01:53:27.167 --> 01:53:28.635
MICROBIAL COMMUNITY THAT MIGHT

01:53:28.701 --> 01:53:30.870
INCLUDE DISEASE OR PARASITES.

01:53:30.937 --> 01:53:32.939
WHEN YOUR CLASSIC IS THEN EATEN

01:53:33.006 --> 01:53:34.474
THE QUESTION IS HOW DOES THAT

01:53:34.541 --> 01:53:36.075
MIXTURE OF THE PLASTIC IN THE

01:53:36.142 --> 01:53:39.045
CHEMICALS IMPACT THE ORGANISMS.

01:53:39.112 --> 01:53:40.079
HERE I'M SHOWING YOU WORK

01:53:40.146 --> 01:53:42.048
ACTUALLY FROM CALIFORNIA DURING

01:53:42.115 --> 01:53:44.851
MY PHD I. PUT PLASTIC M.

01:53:44.918 --> 01:53:46.986
CONTAINED IN THE SAN DIEGO BAY

01:53:47.053 --> 01:53:48.321
ALLOWED IT TO ACCUMULATE

01:53:48.388 --> 01:53:51.191
CONTAMINANTS EXPOSED FISH AND I

01:53:51.257 --> 01:53:53.927
FOUND THAT THE PLASTIC- IN THE

01:53:53.993 --> 01:53:55.361
PLASTIC THAT WAS PUT IN THE SAN

01:53:55.428 --> 01:53:56.863
DIEGO BAY WAS MORE TOXIC THAN

01:53:56.930 --> 01:53:58.298
THE PLASTIC THAT WAS NOT.

01:53:58.364 --> 01:53:59.766
YOU'RE IN SHOWING YOU A TUMOR

01:53:59.832 --> 01:54:01.868
IN THE LIVER OF A FISH THAT WAS

01:54:01.935 --> 01:54:03.870
EXPOSED TO THAT MICROPLASTIC

01:54:03.937 --> 01:54:05.438
FROM THE BANK. WHEREAS FISH

01:54:05.505 --> 01:54:06.673
THAT WERE EXPOSED TO THE CLEAN

01:54:06.739 --> 01:54:09.108
PLASTIC STILL HAD WEIRD LESIONS

01:54:09.175 --> 01:54:10.476
IN THE LIVER BUT THEY WEREN'T

01:54:10.543 --> 01:54:12.745
AS FAR AS TUMOR PROMOTION. AND

01:54:12.812 --> 01:54:14.180
MY PHD STUDENT KENNEDY BUT SHE

01:54:14.247 --> 01:54:15.582
HAS ALSO FOUND THAT

01:54:15.648 --> 01:54:17.617
MICROPLASTICS FROM LAKE ONTARIO

01:54:17.684 --> 01:54:19.819
CAUSES MORE DEFORMITIES IN FISH

01:54:19.886 --> 01:54:24.424
THAN PLASTIC. TAKEN OFF THE

01:54:24.490 --> 01:54:26.025
SHELF. THESE ARE JUST KIND OF

01:54:26.092 --> 01:54:27.327
WANNA STUDY THAT I'M YOU ALSO

01:54:27.393 --> 01:54:29.028
TO TALK YOU ABOUT A THEN I.

01:54:29.095 --> 01:54:30.396
THAT I'VE DONE. THIS MEANS I

01:54:30.463 --> 01:54:31.798
LOOK ACROSS LITERATURE THAT HAS

01:54:31.864 --> 01:54:33.900
JUST REALLY EXPANDED OVER THE

01:54:33.967 --> 01:54:35.835
YEARS AND TRY TO WRITE PAPERS

01:54:35.902 --> 01:54:37.737
THAT STAND THE SIDE ALL OF THAT

01:54:37.804 --> 01:54:39.772
LITERATURE TO SAY. WHAT DO WE

01:54:39.839 --> 01:54:41.307
KNOW ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF

01:54:41.374 --> 01:54:43.710
MICROPLASTICS SO I'M GONNA TRY

01:54:43.776 --> 01:54:44.644
TO GO QUICKLY THROUGH SOME OF

01:54:44.711 --> 01:54:45.878
THOSE RESULTS AND THEN I WOULD

01:54:45.945 --> 01:54:47.580
LOVE TO ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS

01:54:47.647 --> 01:54:50.016
ABOUT IT LATER. SO WHAT WE DO

01:54:50.083 --> 01:54:50.850
IS WE LOOK THROUGH THE

01:54:50.917 --> 01:54:53.152
LITERATURE. AND WE CHECKED THE

01:54:53.219 --> 01:54:55.188
BOX FOR THE SIZE OF PLASTIC

01:54:55.255 --> 01:54:56.589
FROM THAT NANO SCALE THAT WAS

01:54:56.656 --> 01:54:58.524
DISCUSSED EARLIER IT TOO BIG

01:54:58.591 --> 01:55:00.393
FISHING NETS. AND WE LOOK

01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:01.995
ACROSS LEVELS OF BIOLOGICAL

01:55:02.061 --> 01:55:03.796
ORGANISATION I WANT YOU TO

01:55:03.863 --> 01:55:05.198
NOTICE HERE IS THESE ARE SUB

01:55:05.265 --> 01:55:05.999
ORGANISMAL SOMETHING

01:55:06.065 --> 01:55:07.800
PHYSIOLOGICALLY IN THE BODY

01:55:07.867 --> 01:55:09.335
HERE THIS WOULD BE DEATH TO AN

01:55:09.402 --> 01:55:11.271
ORGANISM CHANGING THE SIZE OF

01:55:11.337 --> 01:55:12.905
THE POPULATION OR THE CHANGE IN

01:55:12.972 --> 01:55:15.041
THE COMMUNITY. THE DARKER THE

01:55:15.108 --> 01:55:16.943
SHADING THE MORE EVIDENCE OF

01:55:17.010 --> 01:55:18.945
DEMONSTRATED IMPACT THEIR ART

01:55:19.012 --> 01:55:21.180
TO THAT SIZE OF PLASTIC AND TO

01:55:21.247 --> 01:55:22.548
THAT LEVEL OF BIOLOGICAL

01:55:22.615 --> 01:55:24.050
ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE

01:55:24.117 --> 01:55:25.718
MICROPLASTICS HERE YOU SEE

01:55:25.785 --> 01:55:28.588
BLUE. AT ALMOST EVERY LEVEL.

01:55:28.655 --> 01:55:30.223
INCLUDING UP TO THOSE ONES THAT

01:55:30.290 --> 01:55:31.591
ARE MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY EAGLE

01:55:31.658 --> 01:55:33.893
ARE SORRY ECOLOGICALLY RELEVANT

01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:35.428
SO WE KNOW THAT MICROPLASTICS.

01:55:35.495 --> 01:55:38.965
CAN IMPACT. IN THE MALLS ACROSS

01:55:39.032 --> 01:55:40.066
MANY LEVELS OF BIOLOGICAL

01:55:40.133 --> 01:55:41.734
ORGANIZATIONS AND ACROSS MANY

01:55:41.801 --> 01:55:43.603
SIZES AND THIS EVIDENCE HAS

01:55:43.670 --> 01:55:44.937
BEEN INCREASING OVER THE YEARS

01:55:45.004 --> 01:55:46.873
THIS IS THE SECOND. SYSTEMATIC

01:55:46.939 --> 01:55:49.208
REVIEW AND META ANALYSIS I'VE

01:55:49.275 --> 01:55:50.643
WORKED ON. WHAT'S REALLY

01:55:50.710 --> 01:55:52.612
INTERESTING. IS THAT WE ALSO

01:55:52.679 --> 01:55:54.213
SEE STUDIES THAT TRYING TO

01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:55.882
QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF

01:55:55.948 --> 01:55:56.916
MICROPLASTICS IN THE LAB AND

01:55:56.983 --> 01:55:58.918
THEY DON'T DETECT IN EFFECT SO

01:55:58.985 --> 01:56:00.420
THAT THEY DON'T THIS DOESN'T

01:56:00.486 --> 01:56:02.689
ALWAYS OCCUR SO THE QUESTION IS

01:56:02.755 --> 01:56:03.756
WHY I WILL MAKE A POSITIVE

01:56:03.823 --> 01:56:05.425
THEIR COMPLEXES DR KAUFMAN

01:56:05.491 --> 01:56:07.226
POINTED OUT. THE CONCENTRATION

01:56:07.293 --> 01:56:09.495
MATTERS THIS SIZE MATTERS THE

01:56:09.562 --> 01:56:11.030
SHAPE MATTERS THE TYPE OF

01:56:11.097 --> 01:56:13.232
PLASTIC WE TALKED ABOUT TIRES.

01:56:13.299 --> 01:56:15.335
AND THE TAX THAT IN MY LAST

01:56:15.401 --> 01:56:16.336
THIRTY SECONDS I THINK I MIGHT

01:56:16.402 --> 01:56:18.004
BE OVER I JUST WANT TO SHOW TO

01:56:18.071 --> 01:56:20.173
YOU WHEN WE TRY TO COLLAPSE ALL

01:56:20.239 --> 01:56:27.080
OF THE. VARIABILITY OF THE

01:56:27.146 --> 01:56:28.214
PLASTIC TOGETHER AND TRY TO DO

01:56:28.281 --> 01:56:29.816
A RISKY. THE SAME CON. OF MY

01:56:29.882 --> 01:56:31.117
GROUP. NOW SOME REAL GREAT WORK

01:56:31.184 --> 01:56:32.852
THAT BEEN LET BY DOC ALBERT

01:56:32.919 --> 01:56:34.987
COLEMAN IN THE MATTER. HAS

01:56:35.054 --> 01:56:36.989
FOUND. NUMBERS THAT THEY- MIGHT

01:56:37.056 --> 01:56:39.792
CAUSE A THE FACT ANYWAY FROM A-

01:56:39.859 --> 01:56:40.360
TO FIVE TWENTY ONE PARTICLES

01:56:40.426 --> 01:56:43.029
FRESH WATER. IN EIGHT TO

01:56:43.096 --> 01:56:43.830
FOURTEEN HUNDRED AND NINETY IN

01:56:43.896 --> 01:56:44.897
MARINE THOSE ARE HIGH

01:56:44.964 --> 01:56:46.733
CONCENTRATIONS WE FOUND

01:56:46.799 --> 01:56:48.134
CONCENTRATIONS WITHIN THAT

01:56:48.201 --> 01:56:49.569
RANGE AND STORM WATER IN THE

01:56:49.635 --> 01:56:51.337
SAN FRANCISCO BAY FOR EXAMPLE.

01:56:51.404 --> 01:56:53.106
THE DOCTOR BECKY SAT AND TALKED

01:56:53.172 --> 01:56:55.141
ABOUT- SO THESE CONCENTRATIONS

01:56:55.208 --> 01:56:58.144
ARE ARE NOT ON HER DEATH. AND

01:56:58.211 --> 01:56:59.779
THAT SUGGEST THAT MAYBE WE

01:56:59.846 --> 01:57:01.514
SHOULD START MITIGATING- I'M-

01:57:01.581 --> 01:57:02.982
HERE IN CALIFORNIA OF COURSE

01:57:03.049 --> 01:57:04.350
THE SQUARED WORKING GROUP THAT

01:57:04.417 --> 01:57:05.318
I'M INVOLVED IN IS GOING TO

01:57:05.385 --> 01:57:06.252
COME OUT WITH NUMBERS MORE

01:57:06.319 --> 01:57:08.254
SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA BY

01:57:08.321 --> 01:57:09.722
WORKING ON A RISK ASSESSMENT

01:57:09.789 --> 01:57:11.524
FRAMEWORK. AND THE O. S. D.

01:57:11.591 --> 01:57:13.960
REPORT SHOULD COME OUT AND THIS

01:57:14.026 --> 01:57:15.661
MONTH. AND THAT WILL TALK ABOUT

01:57:15.728 --> 01:57:17.397
PRIORITIES FOR MEASURING

01:57:17.463 --> 01:57:19.065
CONCENTRATIONS IN NATURE SO WE

01:57:19.132 --> 01:57:21.634
CAN COMPARE EXPOSURE TO REST.

01:57:21.701 --> 01:57:23.136
AND I'M SORRY WENT OVER BUT I

01:57:23.202 --> 01:57:26.939
REALLY. APPRECIATE YOUR TIME

01:57:27.006 --> 01:57:28.307
THANK YOU. I BELIEVE EVERY WAS

01:57:28.374 --> 01:57:29.742
ABOUT. I YOU'RE ONLY ONE OVER

01:57:29.809 --> 01:57:35.681
BY SO. OKAY WHEN- AND IT'S SO

01:57:35.748 --> 01:57:37.450
THAT THAT WE REALLY APPRECIATE

01:57:37.517 --> 01:57:40.319
AND WE THANK YOU ALL AS WELL AS

01:57:40.386 --> 01:57:42.088
ALL OUR OTHER PEOPLE FOR TAKING

01:57:42.155 --> 01:57:46.292
THIS TIME- GOING ON IN OUR

01:57:46.359 --> 01:57:49.295
INTERNATIONAL FLAVOR HERE WE'RE

01:57:49.362 --> 01:57:51.030
GOING TO TALK WITH DOCTOR STEPH

01:57:51.097 --> 01:57:53.366
STEPHANIE RIGHT FROM IMPERIAL

01:57:53.433 --> 01:57:55.535
COLLEGE LONDON. AND SHE'S GOING

01:57:55.601 --> 01:57:56.135
TO SHARE WITH US YOUR

01:57:56.202 --> 01:57:57.870
UNDERSTANDING MICROPLASTICS

01:57:57.937 --> 01:58:00.273
PATHWAYS TO HUMANS BY A

01:58:00.339 --> 01:58:02.975
DRINKING WATER AND ALSO SEWAGE

01:58:03.042 --> 01:58:05.111
SLUDGE APPLICATIONS IN AN

01:58:05.178 --> 01:58:07.547
ELATION. AND EVEN DETECTIONS IN

01:58:07.613 --> 01:58:11.217
HUMAN PLACENTAS AND THIS WHOLE

01:58:11.284 --> 01:58:12.552
QUESTION OF SEWAGE SLUDGE WHEN

01:58:12.618 --> 01:58:14.720
I FIRST SAW. THE ESTUARY

01:58:14.787 --> 01:58:16.622
INSTITUTE SAID ALMOST NONE OF

01:58:16.689 --> 01:58:18.024
THE PLASTICS THAT GET INTO THE

01:58:18.090 --> 01:58:21.327
BARRIER ONE THIRD OF 1% COME

01:58:21.394 --> 01:58:24.297
FROM. SEWAGE I STOPPED WORRYING

01:58:24.363 --> 01:58:26.566
ABOUT- SEWAGE TREATMENT I STOP

01:58:26.632 --> 01:58:28.601
WORRYING ABOUT IT AND THEN

01:58:28.668 --> 01:58:30.102
SOMEBODY POINTED OUT TO ME

01:58:30.169 --> 01:58:32.905
PADDED ENDS UP IN THE SLUDGE

01:58:32.972 --> 01:58:34.807
WHOOPS. SO WE'RE LOOKING

01:58:34.874 --> 01:58:36.476
FORWARD TO HEARING FROM DR

01:58:36.542 --> 01:58:41.180
RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HATE

01:58:41.247 --> 01:58:42.315
FOR THE YOU CAN ALL SEE MY

01:58:42.381 --> 01:58:45.184
SLIDE DECK HEY AND YOU CAN HEAR

01:58:45.251 --> 01:58:46.519
ME I QUE ADEM I'M GONNA TRY AND

01:58:46.586 --> 01:58:47.820
KEEP THE WEIGHT BECAUSE IT'S

01:58:47.887 --> 01:58:48.855
ABOUT ELEVEN PM EST FOR HABITS

01:58:48.921 --> 01:58:50.590
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING

01:58:50.656 --> 01:58:52.391
ME AB SITE BE MAKING ON THE

01:58:52.458 --> 01:58:54.260
TOPIC OF MICROPLASTICS FOR

01:58:54.327 --> 01:58:56.462
ABOUT. CLOSE TO TEN IS NOT

01:58:56.529 --> 01:58:58.397
TODAY- OF THE LAST FIVE YEARS

01:58:58.464 --> 01:58:59.866
I'VE BEEN FOCUSING MY RESEARCH

01:58:59.932 --> 01:59:02.568
ON HUMAN EXPOSURE I AM ON THE

01:59:02.635 --> 01:59:05.505
FACTS AND PARTICULARLY FIVE

01:59:05.571 --> 01:59:08.274
YEAH. I'M SORRY. TO BEGIN WITH-

01:59:08.341 --> 01:59:10.243
WE'VE JUST HEARD FROM DR BRYONY

01:59:10.309 --> 01:59:11.944
ABOUT- THE FACT THAT

01:59:12.011 --> 01:59:13.779
MICROPLASTIC IS IN NEED OF

01:59:13.846 --> 01:59:16.215
RECOGNIZED ATHLETES IN. AND SO

01:59:16.282 --> 01:59:17.984
YOU OF COURSE THAT RAISES ALARM

01:59:18.050 --> 01:59:19.986
BELLS THAT WE MIGHT BE EXPOSED

01:59:20.052 --> 01:59:21.454
TO THIS BECAUSE WE BREED THAT.

01:59:21.521 --> 01:59:23.055
AND BUT I JUST WANT TO STRESS

01:59:23.122 --> 01:59:24.690
THIS DOUBLE THE IMPORTANCE OF.

01:59:24.757 --> 01:59:27.960
A DYNAMIC SITES WHEN IT COMES

01:59:28.027 --> 01:59:29.228
TO HUMAN EXPOSURE. NOW THIS IS

01:59:29.295 --> 01:59:31.564
TODAY BUT SIDE BECAUSE IT.

01:59:31.631 --> 01:59:33.432
DEMETRIC SIZE SHAPE AND

01:59:33.499 --> 01:59:35.201
MATERIAL DENSITY INTO THIS

01:59:35.268 --> 01:59:36.903
MEASURE AND IT REALLY MATCHES-

01:59:36.969 --> 01:59:38.638
INDICATES HOW THESE PARTICLES

01:59:38.704 --> 01:59:41.040
BEHAVE AND ACT. AB SE PARTICLES

01:59:41.107 --> 01:59:42.808
HAVING DIFFERENT DIE PENSIONS

01:59:42.875 --> 01:59:44.877
AND SHAPES MAY BEHAVE THE SAME

01:59:44.944 --> 01:59:46.078
IN THAT AND BASS WILL HAVE TO

01:59:46.145 --> 01:59:48.681
SAVE EVERY DYNAMIC SIZE. WHY IS

01:59:48.748 --> 01:59:51.284
THIS IMPORTANT IT'S IT SAYS WHY

01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:52.785
IT THIS PARTICLE MAKER IN THAT

01:59:52.852 --> 01:59:54.487
WAY AND THAT'S WHERE IT COULD

01:59:54.554 --> 01:59:55.655
LINES AND THE FULL WHERE

01:59:55.721 --> 01:59:58.190
EXPOSURE MIKE K. SO THIS PHASE

01:59:58.257 --> 01:59:59.859
WHICH CAN REACH THE CENTRAL AT

01:59:59.926 --> 02:00:02.762
WAYS OR TRUCK YEAH. AB DID IT

02:00:02.828 --> 02:00:03.729
HAPPEN IRATE DYNAMIC DAMAGE

02:00:03.796 --> 02:00:05.998
LESS THAN TEN MICRONS AT US

02:00:06.065 --> 02:00:07.500
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS SAT IN

02:00:07.567 --> 02:00:10.069
SIZE AT APPROXIMATELY AND THOSE

02:00:10.136 --> 02:00:11.337
THAT CAN REACH THE DEEP PLAN

02:00:11.404 --> 02:00:12.505
COVERED IRATE DYNAMIC DYNAMIC

02:00:12.572 --> 02:00:18.144
TO. LESS. THAN TWO POINT FIVE

02:00:18.210 --> 02:00:21.380
MICRONS. AB ARE THESE REPORTS

02:00:21.447 --> 02:00:22.548
SIZE FRACTIONS WHICH WILL SAVE

02:00:22.615 --> 02:00:24.850
WILL WHEN WE MEASURE UP PARTICK

02:00:24.917 --> 02:00:30.122
ACT THE BEST M. HE EXPECTS.

02:00:30.189 --> 02:00:31.791
THERE IS EMAIL MY BY NOT NAY

02:00:31.857 --> 02:00:34.827
APTLY IS YET FIFTH. A RISK

02:00:34.894 --> 02:00:37.129
FACTOR FOR MOST GOOD. EVAN OF

02:00:37.196 --> 02:00:40.900
IRAQ. SPECIFIC KEPT AND POINT

02:00:40.967 --> 02:00:43.536
FIVE THAT'S LINKED TO S. TO SEE

02:00:43.603 --> 02:00:45.071
FROM PRIVATE TO AMONG TO. SITE

02:00:45.137 --> 02:00:46.672
THIS IS GRAY OF ITS PINT AS

02:00:46.739 --> 02:00:48.240
YOU CAN SEE ON THIS GRAPH HERE

02:00:48.307 --> 02:00:50.343
AND HE CAN SEE THIS INCREASED

02:00:50.409 --> 02:00:54.714
RISK. FOR CARDIOVASCULAR

02:00:54.780 --> 02:00:55.314
RESPIRATORY DISEASES. BUT IT'S

02:00:55.381 --> 02:00:57.083
A PERCEIVED AS SMALL FOR. OF

02:00:57.149 --> 02:01:00.286
THIS APART MATTER DR TOXICITY

02:01:00.353 --> 02:01:01.420
THIS IS NOT YOU STILL BE

02:01:01.487 --> 02:01:02.588
RECESSED IN THE LONG

02:01:02.655 --> 02:01:04.890
ESTABLISHED EQUITY COMMUNITY.

02:01:04.957 --> 02:01:06.659
AND THE MICROPLASTIC CONTENT IN

02:01:06.726 --> 02:01:08.628
THESE AFRICANS HAVEN'T BEEN

02:01:08.694 --> 02:01:10.396
QUANTIFIED YET AND SAY THE

02:01:10.463 --> 02:01:11.597
RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF

02:01:11.664 --> 02:01:12.798
MICROPLASTIC INHALATION

02:01:12.865 --> 02:01:14.834
EXPOSURE TO RESPIRATORY AND

02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:16.335
CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH HEALTH

02:01:16.402 --> 02:01:20.172
OUTCOMES. IS STILL AT NINE. I'M

02:01:20.239 --> 02:01:20.806
THAT'S WHY MY LOT FIFTEEN

02:01:20.873 --> 02:01:22.208
ABDUCTING APPLYING DIFFERENT

02:01:22.274 --> 02:01:23.442
ANALYTICAL METHODS TO

02:01:23.509 --> 02:01:25.177
INVESTIGATE THE MICROPLASTIC

02:01:25.244 --> 02:01:27.179
CONTENT OF THESE IMPORTANT SIZE

02:01:27.246 --> 02:01:30.783
FRACTIONS AND CURRENTLY- WHILE

02:01:30.850 --> 02:01:32.018
WORKING ON INDOOR AND OUTDOOR

02:01:32.084 --> 02:01:34.487
AT. SAFETY INHALABLE

02:01:34.553 --> 02:01:36.422
MICROPLASTICS OKAY IT YES BUT

02:01:36.489 --> 02:01:38.758
WITH SOME UNCERTAINTY AS PROOF

02:01:38.824 --> 02:01:40.960
OF PRINCIPLE FOR OUR ANALYTICAL

02:01:41.027 --> 02:01:43.262
MESSAGE ME ANALYZED IF YOU HAVE

02:01:43.329 --> 02:01:45.464
TEN SAMPLE M. I. WE FOUND DAVID

02:01:45.531 --> 02:01:46.499
TWO AND A HALF THOUSAND

02:01:46.565 --> 02:01:49.001
MICROPLASTICS TO KEEP IT MAKES

02:01:49.068 --> 02:01:51.470
A- I'M JUST THE PERSON CONTEXT

02:01:51.537 --> 02:01:54.106
FOR EQUIPMENT. AB SIZE RANGE

02:01:54.173 --> 02:01:56.809
FOR TOTAL PARTICULATE MATTER.

02:01:56.876 --> 02:01:58.344
YOU CAN SEE IT IS ALMOST TEN

02:01:58.411 --> 02:02:00.312
MILLION PEOPLE PARTICLES THEY

02:02:00.379 --> 02:02:01.747
KEEP IT MAKES OF ASK FEDERAL

02:02:01.814 --> 02:02:03.716
MICROPLASTICS BUT THERE ARE OF

02:02:03.783 --> 02:02:05.317
COURSE LOTS OF COPY AT SIERRA.

02:02:05.384 --> 02:02:07.420
FIRSTLY MICROPLASTIC IS TALKED

02:02:07.486 --> 02:02:09.188
NUMBER A SECONDLY THIS IS

02:02:09.255 --> 02:02:10.990
REALLY CREATE ESTIMATE WE NEED

02:02:11.057 --> 02:02:11.957
SOME RIGHT BEST EXPOSURE

02:02:12.024 --> 02:02:13.592
CONCENTRATIONS IN DIFFERENT

02:02:13.659 --> 02:02:15.094
TYPES F ENVIRONMENTS IN

02:02:15.161 --> 02:02:20.700
DIFFERENT. LOCATIONS OVER TIME.

02:02:20.766 --> 02:02:22.068
HOWEVER WHAT'S IMPORTANT EVEN

02:02:22.134 --> 02:02:23.135
IF THIS REPRESENTS A SMALL

02:02:23.202 --> 02:02:24.770
FRACTION OF AMBIENT PARTICULATE

02:02:24.837 --> 02:02:26.672
MATTER IS THAT MICROPLASTIC IS

02:02:26.739 --> 02:02:29.709
PERSISTENT. SIR IF IT WORKS TO

02:02:29.775 --> 02:02:30.609
KEEP AN EYE IN THE BODY ACROSS

02:02:30.676 --> 02:02:32.311
THE STATE A TIME IT COULD REACH

02:02:32.378 --> 02:02:33.713
CONCENTRATIONS THAT BECAME

02:02:33.779 --> 02:02:35.347
DETRIMENTAL TO HEALTH AND

02:02:35.414 --> 02:02:37.283
BECAME A HOUSE IT. IS IMPORTANT

02:02:37.349 --> 02:02:38.184
TO UNDERSTAND THE RELATIVE

02:02:38.250 --> 02:02:39.618
CONTRIBUTION TO POTS TO

02:02:39.685 --> 02:02:41.420
EXPOSURE BUT ALSO THE RELATIVE

02:02:41.487 --> 02:02:43.355
PAY AGENCY THAT COMBATS OF THE

02:02:43.422 --> 02:02:48.194
PARTICLES RACKSPACE TO AND. OF

02:02:48.260 --> 02:02:48.761
COURSE SEVEN THOUSAND EXTRA

02:02:48.828 --> 02:02:50.496
FACTS. SO THERE IS SOME OF THAT

02:02:50.563 --> 02:02:51.897
MICROPLASTICS IN THAT WAY CAN

02:02:51.964 --> 02:02:54.033
CAUSE HARM AB OCCUPATIONAL

02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:55.434
EXPOSURE TO HIGH LEVELS OF

02:02:55.501 --> 02:02:56.902
PLASTIC TEST WHICH ARE SMALL

02:02:56.969 --> 02:02:58.871
ENOUGH TO REPLACE DEEP POT THE

02:02:58.938 --> 02:03:00.973
POTS OF THE LINK. AB CAN CAUSE

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:03.442
ADVERSE EFFECTS DISRAELI'S THE

02:03:03.509 --> 02:03:04.577
NINETEEN SEVENTIES THERE WERE

02:03:04.643 --> 02:03:06.178
OUTBREAKS OF DISEASE AND

02:03:06.245 --> 02:03:08.414
SYNTHETIC TEXTILE WORKERS THE

02:03:08.481 --> 02:03:09.648
VICE WELL DEFINED ITS CLOCK

02:03:09.715 --> 02:03:11.784
BECAUSE LUCK. AB THIS IS THE

02:03:11.851 --> 02:03:13.352
NYLON FLOCKING INDUSTRY WHICH

02:03:13.419 --> 02:03:14.754
IS ESSENTIALLY A SHORT CUT

02:03:14.820 --> 02:03:17.022
NYLON FIBER. AND WHEN IT'S CUT

02:03:17.089 --> 02:03:18.557
WITH A MALE IT GENERATES THE

02:03:18.624 --> 02:03:20.392
DUST WHICH IS VERY VERY FINE

02:03:20.459 --> 02:03:22.495
REACH THE LOWER. EAST TO THE

02:03:22.561 --> 02:03:25.564
DISEASE AB ASIDE FROM PATIENTS

02:03:25.631 --> 02:03:26.832
PRESENTING WITH CHEST PAIN AND

02:03:26.899 --> 02:03:28.734
SHORTNESS OF BREATH COUGH THE

02:03:28.801 --> 02:03:30.302
DISEASE CAUSES CHRONIC

02:03:30.369 --> 02:03:31.103
INFLAMMATION AND TISSUE

02:03:31.170 --> 02:03:35.674
SCARRING. IN THE LIVER ADVICE.

02:03:35.741 --> 02:03:36.909
NO THIS IS A REGISTER IT

02:03:36.976 --> 02:03:38.410
USUALLY TO AFTER REMOVAL

02:03:38.477 --> 02:03:40.813
EXPOSURE BUT IN SOME WAYS CASES

02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:42.314
IT KIND OF FALLS INTO YOUR

02:03:42.381 --> 02:03:44.283
SPIRIT TO FIGHT YEAH. AND HIGH

02:03:44.350 --> 02:03:46.118
EXPOSURE CONCENTRATIONS HAVE

02:03:46.185 --> 02:03:48.254
BEEN OBSERVED SITE THESE ARE

02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:49.889
MUCH GREATER THAN WHAT WE TAX

02:03:49.955 --> 02:03:51.824
EXPERIENCE IN THE ENVIRONMENT-

02:03:51.891 --> 02:03:53.058
BUT OF COURSE IT RAISES THE

02:03:53.125 --> 02:03:54.794
QUESTION OF WHY BAYERN MENTAL

02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:56.695
EXPOSURE A FULL A FOR A LONGER

02:03:56.762 --> 02:03:59.198
TIME PERIOD. WHAT D. S. M. IT

02:03:59.265 --> 02:04:00.566
SHOWS WHAT THESE PARTICLES LOOK

02:04:00.633 --> 02:04:02.401
LIKE BECAUSE YOU MAY THINK THAT

02:04:02.468 --> 02:04:03.235
FIVE IS AND SOME OF THEM

02:04:03.302 --> 02:04:05.171
CERTAINLY OFF FIBROUS BUT SOME

02:04:05.237 --> 02:04:08.474
OF MY OLD SITE PARTICULATE AS

02:04:08.541 --> 02:04:09.542
WELL. IT'S NOT JUST BEING

02:04:09.608 --> 02:04:11.310
OBSERVED FOR NINE FLOCK BUT FOR

02:04:11.377 --> 02:04:14.246
POLICE. POLY AND RIGHT ON WHICH

02:04:14.313 --> 02:04:14.880
IS SIMILAR TO CELLULASE

02:04:14.947 --> 02:04:17.249
ACETATES AS WELL. AS OF COURSE

02:04:17.316 --> 02:04:18.951
THIS RAISES QUESTIONS IS THIS

02:04:19.018 --> 02:04:20.052
EFFECT BECAUSE IT'S A

02:04:20.119 --> 02:04:21.887
PERSISTENT MATERIAL IN THE LONG

02:04:21.954 --> 02:04:23.756
OR CERTAIN ATTRIBUTES OF THE

02:04:23.823 --> 02:04:26.425
MATERIAL WHICH MAKES IT

02:04:26.492 --> 02:04:28.227
PARTICULARLY INFLAMMATORY.

02:04:28.294 --> 02:04:29.094
THERE'S ALSO EVIDENCE FROM

02:04:29.161 --> 02:04:30.830
ANIMAL STUDIES REGARDING MY

02:04:30.896 --> 02:04:33.265
CAUSTIC TOXICITY IN THAT IT THE

02:04:33.332 --> 02:04:35.034
LONG SORRY THE RIGHTS BECAUSE

02:04:35.100 --> 02:04:36.435
YOU CAN SEE RELATES TO WHAT IS

02:04:36.502 --> 02:04:38.904
BEING TOXIC FACTS. SPECIFICALLY

02:04:38.971 --> 02:04:40.606
HIGHLY TOXIC EFFECTS THE

02:04:40.673 --> 02:04:42.741
ETHYLENE OXIDE PROPYLENE OXIDE

02:04:42.808 --> 02:04:43.943
BUT LUCKILY WE DEBT RATING

02:04:44.009 --> 02:04:45.911
COUNTS THE IN THE APARTMENT. IT

02:04:45.978 --> 02:04:48.547
JUST STAYS UP AB. BASED IN

02:04:48.614 --> 02:04:50.082
OCCUPATIONAL SETTINGS ON ANIMAL

02:04:50.149 --> 02:04:54.220
STUDIES MICROPLASTICS. APPEAR

02:04:54.286 --> 02:04:55.087
TO CAUSE TOXICITY. HOWEVER THE

02:04:55.154 --> 02:04:56.922
VERY FEW STUDIES WHICH OFTEN

02:04:56.989 --> 02:05:00.593
LAST AB IS OF AND SAID IT'S IN

02:05:00.659 --> 02:05:01.927
SPECIE STRESS. HOW THIS RELATES

02:05:01.994 --> 02:05:04.163
TO HUMANS AND SPECIES WE'RE

02:05:04.230 --> 02:05:05.598
COMPOSED AND THEY ARE OUT DAY

02:05:05.664 --> 02:05:07.800
SITS WITH MAJORITY BEING TODAY

02:05:07.867 --> 02:05:08.767
FOR TWENTY IS A GUY WHO SAYS

02:05:08.834 --> 02:05:10.069
DEFINITELY IN NEED OF AN UPDATE

02:05:10.135 --> 02:05:11.270
AND WE DEFINITELY NEED TO FILL

02:05:11.337 --> 02:05:13.873
IN SOME OF THESE CRUCIAL

02:05:13.939 --> 02:05:14.840
KNOWLEDGE GAPS. SO HOW MUCH

02:05:14.907 --> 02:05:16.575
MICROPLASTIC CAUSE HARM WELL

02:05:16.642 --> 02:05:17.877
TELL SEIZE ALREADY TOUCHED UPON

02:05:17.943 --> 02:05:19.511
INFLAMMATION SO IF A

02:05:19.578 --> 02:05:20.913
MICROPLASTIC WITH SEE YOU

02:05:20.980 --> 02:05:22.214
INTERACT WITH AND I WAY STYLE

02:05:22.281 --> 02:05:23.816
OR INTERVENE STYLE. THIS WOULD

02:05:23.883 --> 02:05:25.351
TRIGGER A PRIOR INFLAMMATORY

02:05:25.417 --> 02:05:27.219
RESPONSE WHICH COULD LEADS TO

02:05:27.286 --> 02:05:29.088
TISSUE DAMAGE. HAD BEEN UP

02:05:29.154 --> 02:05:30.689
AUDIO TRYING TO REPAIR THAT

02:05:30.756 --> 02:05:32.324
TISSUE DAMAGE THAT BECAUSE I'VE

02:05:32.391 --> 02:05:34.927
AT THE STIMULUS IS CONSTANT OLD

02:05:34.994 --> 02:05:37.296
PERSISTENCE AS MICROPLASTICS

02:05:37.363 --> 02:05:39.164
SAW. THIS TISSUE REPAIR ELEMENT

02:05:39.231 --> 02:05:40.699
COULD BECOME HEIGHTENED DAVID

02:05:40.766 --> 02:05:42.334
TIME AND THAT'S WHAT WITH THE

02:05:42.401 --> 02:05:43.869
TO SCARRING AND EVENTUALLY IN

02:05:43.936 --> 02:05:46.171
WEST CASES LOSS OF FUNCTION FOR

02:05:46.238 --> 02:05:47.973
THE TISSUE ORGAN. OF COURSE

02:05:48.040 --> 02:05:49.441
THIS IS A HYPOTHESIS WHICH

02:05:49.508 --> 02:05:51.610
NEEDS TO BE TESTED FOR

02:05:51.677 --> 02:05:53.012
MICROPLASTICS BUT IT IS A

02:05:53.078 --> 02:05:54.914
PROPOSED. ADVERSE OUTCOME

02:05:54.980 --> 02:05:56.982
PATHWAY FOR OF A CONSISTENT

02:05:57.049 --> 02:06:04.089
PARTICLES. BUT ENTITLED. BUT IN

02:06:04.156 --> 02:06:06.158
A DAY CARE AND ISOLATE WHEN I.

02:06:06.225 --> 02:06:07.927
THEM AND I. OF THERE ARE

02:06:07.993 --> 02:06:09.261
PARALLELS OF THE PARTICULATE

02:06:09.328 --> 02:06:10.996
MUST SAY WE IN ITSELF IS A-

02:06:11.063 --> 02:06:14.033
MIXTURE SO THE RIGHT CHEEK SEE

02:06:14.099 --> 02:06:15.901
A REPRESENTATIVE COSTS. FOR A

02:06:15.968 --> 02:06:17.269
MINUTE BEEN SACKED GOAL FOR

02:06:17.336 --> 02:06:18.470
TRAFFIC COMMISSION YOU CAN SEE

02:06:18.537 --> 02:06:20.673
IS A- COAL METALS AND DIFFERENT

02:06:20.739 --> 02:06:22.308
CHEMICAL SPECIES ON THE

02:06:22.374 --> 02:06:23.208
SURFACE. AND THE SAME CAN

02:06:23.275 --> 02:06:25.010
HAPPEN FOR MICROPLASTICS IN THE

02:06:25.077 --> 02:06:26.779
ENVIRONMENT SO WHETHER THESE

02:06:26.845 --> 02:06:28.948
PARTICLES ALSO CONTRIBUTE HOME

02:06:29.014 --> 02:06:30.783
BY DELIVERING DAY USES OF THESE

02:06:30.849 --> 02:06:35.854
M. AMBIENCE THAT. SPECIES IS

02:06:35.921 --> 02:06:37.222
ALSO OF CONCERN. I JUST WANTED

02:06:37.289 --> 02:06:38.991
TO THE GOOD AS WELL BECAUSE M.

02:06:39.058 --> 02:06:40.960
AS WELL AS I'VE MENTIONED MESA

02:06:41.026 --> 02:06:42.394
THE PARTICLES THAT HAVE BEEN

02:06:42.461 --> 02:06:43.963
OBSERVED IN ASPHALT

02:06:44.029 --> 02:06:46.031
MICROPLASTIC PARTICLES WHAT WE

02:06:46.098 --> 02:06:47.633
CONSIDER COSTS OR LARGER THAN

02:06:47.700 --> 02:06:49.401
THE COURSE MIGHT. IN A BIG OF

02:06:49.468 --> 02:06:51.437
AT TEN MICRONS IN SIZE IS

02:06:51.503 --> 02:06:52.638
DOESN'T MEAN THE WHITE AND

02:06:52.705 --> 02:06:54.340
HILUM IT JUST MEANS IF WE DO

02:06:54.406 --> 02:06:55.975
THEY'LL PROBABLY TO POSIT OUT

02:06:56.041 --> 02:06:57.443
NAY USE ENOUGH FOR IT TO THE

02:06:57.509 --> 02:06:59.144
MOUTH I WILL SOLELY THEM AND

02:06:59.211 --> 02:07:00.546
THAT LEADS TO EXPOSURE AT THE

02:07:00.612 --> 02:07:02.214
CUTS. AND OF COURSE JOIN OF A

02:07:02.281 --> 02:07:04.116
SOURCES SUCH AS FROM THE DIETS

02:07:04.183 --> 02:07:05.918
FROM DRINKING WATER FROM THE

02:07:05.985 --> 02:07:08.520
DUST. OF THE IS EVIDENCE OF

02:07:08.587 --> 02:07:13.092
THIS TALK OF EXPOSURE. WITH

02:07:13.158 --> 02:07:15.427
OBSERVATIONS OF HUMAN. SO IS A

02:07:15.494 --> 02:07:17.596
VERY SMALL. STUDY ADMITTED IT'S

02:07:17.663 --> 02:07:21.200
EVIDENCE THAT. FIERY JUST. ANAK

02:07:21.266 --> 02:07:23.002
QUESTION. WHAT'S IS THIS.

02:07:23.068 --> 02:07:24.470
DISTRIBUTION IN JUST POTS. AND

02:07:24.536 --> 02:07:26.939
REFER. WHAT COMES SCOTT. AND

02:07:27.006 --> 02:07:28.340
BECAUSE THE SMALL THE PARTICLE

02:07:28.407 --> 02:07:30.843
THE MORE LIKELY THAT RESPECT.

02:07:30.909 --> 02:07:32.211
FOR INTERACTION WITH CELLS AND

02:07:32.277 --> 02:07:34.513
TISSUES EIGHT INTO UP TAKE. A

02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:37.449
REVIEW FROM THE GUIDANCE TO

02:07:37.516 --> 02:07:39.752
CHEESE. THANK YOU TOXIC EFFECTS

02:07:39.818 --> 02:07:42.521
A KID IN THE CUT OF IT JUST AND

02:07:42.588 --> 02:07:45.090
ADAM AND OF THESE OF AND FOR.

02:07:45.157 --> 02:07:46.959
REDUCE MUCUS SECRETION AND-

02:07:47.026 --> 02:07:50.596
AFFECTED TO GET TO MY CAR BY A-

02:07:50.662 --> 02:07:51.830
THERE'S ALSO EFFECTS IN THE

02:07:51.897 --> 02:07:53.132
LIVER WHICH CAN OCCUR WHICH

02:07:53.198 --> 02:07:54.600
EXCEEDS OF CHANGES AT THE TOP

02:07:54.666 --> 02:07:55.934
OF THE SAID AND IN FACT

02:07:56.001 --> 02:07:58.537
COMPOSITION. BUT ALSO EQUALLY

02:07:58.604 --> 02:07:59.805
THERE ARE SOME CITIES WHICH IS

02:07:59.872 --> 02:08:03.275
OBSERVED BY. I HAVE SIGNIFICANT

02:08:03.342 --> 02:08:04.843
EFFECTS AS WELL. I JUST WANT TO

02:08:04.910 --> 02:08:06.278
POINT OUT THAT THE CITY'S WORLD

02:08:06.345 --> 02:08:09.048
AND WAY OF. JUST ONE OR TWO

02:08:09.114 --> 02:08:10.449
POLHEMUS SAY THE MAJORITY THAT

02:08:10.516 --> 02:08:11.784
COUPLE OF STYRENE ON THE

02:08:11.850 --> 02:08:13.852
ADMINISTERED THESE. PARTICLES

02:08:13.919 --> 02:08:17.056
BORSA AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS.

02:08:17.122 --> 02:08:18.590
IT'S VERY HARD TO MONITOR THE

02:08:18.657 --> 02:08:19.792
DICE THAT'S DELIVERED TO THE

02:08:19.858 --> 02:08:21.193
ANIMAL BECAUSE SADDAM HOLES

02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:22.694
HELP THEMSELVES TO WATER ACT

02:08:22.761 --> 02:08:24.630
HAWK. AND ADDITIONALLY IT IS A

02:08:24.696 --> 02:08:27.066
QUESTION AIFA AT. THE DATE THE

02:08:27.132 --> 02:08:28.967
TASTE IN TERMS OF HOW THE

02:08:29.034 --> 02:08:30.903
PARTICLES WERE DISPERSED IN THE

02:08:30.969 --> 02:08:32.738
WATER LEVEL SACRAMENTO OUT OVER

02:08:32.805 --> 02:08:34.473
TIME DELIVERING A VERY HIGH

02:08:34.540 --> 02:08:37.076
DAIS. AND EXPOSURE IS ALWAYS

02:08:37.142 --> 02:08:42.781
SOME. COPYCATS SO M. I'M GONNA

02:08:42.848 --> 02:08:43.816
SAY AWAY FROM THE FACT THAT

02:08:43.882 --> 02:08:46.285
OUGHT TO GET IN A- STOP ONCE

02:08:46.351 --> 02:08:48.353
WHEN IT COMES MY CLASS AND HOW.

02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:48.954
I THINK ONE OF THE MASON. ONES

02:08:49.021 --> 02:08:51.390
IS HOW TO REACT. TO AB HOW DOES

02:08:51.457 --> 02:08:53.525
THIS DE BY JOE. AND GIVE THESE

02:08:53.592 --> 02:08:55.227
AND DAY. OF COURSE WE NEEDS A

02:08:55.294 --> 02:08:56.929
MORE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL.

02:08:56.995 --> 02:08:58.597
EFFECTS IN HUMANS HOWEVER THE

02:08:58.664 --> 02:08:59.998
SYSTEM AB DRIVEN BY CAUSTIC

02:09:00.065 --> 02:09:02.101
TIGHT OF SHAPE HOWEVER THEY

02:09:02.167 --> 02:09:08.173
SUCH THE ON IMPORTS A TOTAL. I

02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:09.842
WHAT ABOUT THE- FILE. WITH A

02:09:09.908 --> 02:09:11.577
LIST OF MY- TO COURSE THESE.

02:09:11.643 --> 02:09:12.778
KNOWLEDGE GAP IN MY I JUST IT

02:09:12.845 --> 02:09:14.413
ARE YOU THE POINT THAT. THE MAY

02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:16.682
BEEN IN WE ALL ALL LABOR.

02:09:16.748 --> 02:09:18.917
FACEMASK THAT TO. THIS IS

02:09:18.984 --> 02:09:19.585
LIKELY GOING TO A PART OF A

02:09:19.651 --> 02:09:21.253
FUTURE THE NEXT YEARS. THESE

02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:23.455
MATERIALS. I WOULD BE SAID

02:09:23.522 --> 02:09:25.457
ABBOTT SUGGESTS NOT SHUTTING OF

02:09:25.524 --> 02:09:26.658
THESE FIVE IS SERVICE MASKS

02:09:26.725 --> 02:09:28.160
INTO THE NASAL CAVITY. COULD

02:09:28.227 --> 02:09:30.295
TRIGGER IT KEEPS INFORMATION.

02:09:30.362 --> 02:09:34.466
AB SIMPLISTIC BUT ITIS.

02:09:34.533 --> 02:09:35.868
ADDITIONALLY WILL MAKE. SOME

02:09:35.934 --> 02:09:37.069
WITH THE WITH A GOOD JOB REDUCE

02:09:37.136 --> 02:09:39.238
THE OVER SOURCES A EMISSIONS OF

02:09:39.304 --> 02:09:39.805
APPLICATIONS SUCH AS THE- X.

02:09:39.872 --> 02:09:41.807
AND- SOLID FUEL BETTING. BUT

02:09:41.874 --> 02:09:42.875
WAS STILL GOING TO BE USING

02:09:42.941 --> 02:09:45.043
PLASTIC AND A STILL LEGACY LEFT

02:09:45.110 --> 02:09:46.245
SAID IT'S PLASTIC LESSER THE

02:09:46.311 --> 02:09:47.679
ENVIRONMENT WHICH WILL CONTINUE

02:09:47.746 --> 02:09:49.314
TO DEGRADE. TO THE ACTIVATION

02:09:49.381 --> 02:09:51.350
PROFILE IS GOING TO CHANGE AND

02:09:51.416 --> 02:09:53.452
POSSIBLY FLUX TOWARDS A HIGHER

02:09:53.519 --> 02:09:55.787
LEVEL OF MICROPLASTIC. AS THERE

02:09:55.854 --> 02:09:58.056
IS AN EMERGING ISSUE. I'M SORRY

02:09:58.123 --> 02:10:00.092
FOR SPEEDING THREE THEM I HAD A

02:10:00.159 --> 02:10:02.261
FAVOURITE I'M VERY SORRY BUT

02:10:02.327 --> 02:10:02.761
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

02:10:02.828 --> 02:10:05.731
LISTENING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

02:10:05.797 --> 02:10:07.432
AND PARTICULARLY FOR STAYING UP

02:10:07.499 --> 02:10:09.835
TO LA ELEVEN FIFTEEN ALL. IN

02:10:09.902 --> 02:10:17.809
LONDON- WHAT DO HAVE QUESTIONS.

02:10:17.876 --> 02:10:22.080
OKAY THREE OF US. THANK YOU TO

02:10:22.147 --> 02:10:25.150
ALL THE PER- SO YOU MENTIONED

02:10:25.217 --> 02:10:27.085
THAT SINCE WE'RE ALL WEARING

02:10:27.152 --> 02:10:28.787
THESE FACE MASKS AND THEY

02:10:28.854 --> 02:10:30.422
SHOULD HAVE YOU KNOW THAT THAT

02:10:30.489 --> 02:10:31.857
WAS THE BIGGEST CONCERN RIGHT

02:10:31.924 --> 02:10:33.959
NOW BECAUSE IT'S- CURRENTLY OUR

02:10:34.026 --> 02:10:38.130
REALITY- WHAT COULD WE BE DOING

02:10:38.197 --> 02:10:39.498
WE ARE WE IN A YEAR ARE WE

02:10:39.565 --> 02:10:43.101
GOING TO SEE THE EFFECTS OF

02:10:43.168 --> 02:10:46.038
THIS SOME MEDICAL AFFECTS. AND

02:10:46.104 --> 02:10:47.573
I'M IS A REALLY GOOD QUESTION

02:10:47.639 --> 02:10:49.341
AND I THINK IT IS A SITE IS

02:10:49.408 --> 02:10:51.777
JUST A MANAGING IT IS ONE PAPER

02:10:51.843 --> 02:10:53.278
THAT'S COME OUT TO SHOW YOU.

02:10:53.345 --> 02:10:56.315
THE TO SHOW YOU THIS AB. AND I

02:10:56.381 --> 02:10:58.617
THINK PATIENTS PRESENTED WITH

02:10:58.684 --> 02:10:59.818
INFLAMMATORY EFFECTS IN THE

02:10:59.885 --> 02:11:02.888
NASAL CAVITY SIMILAR TO YOU AS-

02:11:02.955 --> 02:11:05.390
WELL IT'S COLD AT A RECENT RUN

02:11:05.457 --> 02:11:07.693
ITIS OR NON ALLERGIC RHINITIS.

02:11:07.759 --> 02:11:10.062
AT SYMBOL TAX MARINO I WASTED

02:11:10.128 --> 02:11:11.263
ISN'T IT NICE COMMITTEE AND

02:11:11.330 --> 02:11:13.432
THIS WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED

02:11:13.498 --> 02:11:18.303
WITH. THE NUMBER OF PLASTIC.

02:11:18.370 --> 02:11:19.605
FIBERS IN THE NIGHTS. I THINK

02:11:19.671 --> 02:11:21.573
ONE OF THE ISSUES IS THAT.

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:24.309
OBVIOUSLY NEED TO BUY A PTA

02:11:24.376 --> 02:11:25.978
PART OF MANAGING THIS POPPED UP.

02:11:26.044 --> 02:11:30.983
BUT DOES ALSO OF. YOU KNOW

02:11:31.049 --> 02:11:32.084
WE'VE NOT HAD TO THE SPEED AT

02:11:32.150 --> 02:11:33.418
THIS TIME SAID AS PER A LOT OF

02:11:33.485 --> 02:11:35.187
MY OUT WHICH WE REALLY KNOW

02:11:35.254 --> 02:11:36.388
MUCH ABOUT THE QUALITY. WE

02:11:36.455 --> 02:11:37.623
DON'T KNOW HOW I THINK IT DOES

02:11:37.689 --> 02:11:39.891
AND WE DON'T RATING EVEN I WILL

02:11:39.958 --> 02:11:41.059
BOTH NOT SHUTTING IS WHAT

02:11:41.126 --> 02:11:43.395
SOCIETY THINKS ABOUT. IF IT'S A

02:11:43.462 --> 02:11:44.963
POSSIBLE DRIVING THIS IF IT'S

02:11:45.030 --> 02:11:47.399
ASSOCIATED ADDITIVES AB SO WE

02:11:47.466 --> 02:11:49.368
DEFINITELY NEED STABLE MORE

02:11:49.434 --> 02:11:51.103
RESEARCH RATING FIGURE OUT BUT

02:11:51.169 --> 02:11:52.137
AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED TO

02:11:52.204 --> 02:11:53.705
MANAGE THE PANDEMIC'S AYE I

02:11:53.772 --> 02:11:55.707
THINK UNTIL. MORE EVIDENCE

02:11:55.774 --> 02:11:58.844
COMES OUT OF IT WE CAN'T REALLY

02:11:58.910 --> 02:12:00.646
MAKE A CONCLUSIVE DECISION I'VE

02:12:00.712 --> 02:12:04.916
AWAY AS TO AS TO WHAT. WE DO

02:12:04.983 --> 02:12:05.550
WHICH IS THE BEST WAY FORWARD.

02:12:05.617 --> 02:12:07.052
OKAY WELL THANK YOU EVERY IT'S

02:12:07.119 --> 02:12:09.354
VERY CONCERNING TO ME I HAD. I

02:12:09.421 --> 02:12:10.689
HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT THAT YOU

02:12:10.756 --> 02:12:12.591
KNOW US AND HELEEN. OF

02:12:12.658 --> 02:12:15.327
MICROPLASTICS. VIA THESE MASKS

02:12:15.394 --> 02:12:17.562
THAT WEAR AND WEARING AND- THAT

02:12:17.629 --> 02:12:18.864
IS DEFINITELY IT LIKE YOU SAID

02:12:18.930 --> 02:12:20.799
IT'S NOT REGULATED ON WHAT TYPE

02:12:20.866 --> 02:12:22.834
OF MATERIALS ARE BEING USED IN.

02:12:22.901 --> 02:12:24.336
WERE JUST ALL BEING ASKED TO

02:12:24.403 --> 02:12:25.971
JUST PROTECT OURSELVES RIGHT

02:12:26.038 --> 02:12:30.709
AWAY OR SOMETHING- AND SO THANK

02:12:30.776 --> 02:12:31.843
YOU FOR ALERTING US DEFINITELY.

02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:33.312
THAT'S OKAY WELL I WOULD SAY IS

02:12:33.378 --> 02:12:34.846
THAT THAT IT SENATE KEATS

02:12:34.913 --> 02:12:37.182
AFFECTED SAY IF THE MOMENT HE

02:12:37.249 --> 02:12:38.517
D. FEEL DISCOMFORT FROM YOUR

02:12:38.583 --> 02:12:40.385
FACE MASK YOU CAN YOU KNOW YOU

02:12:40.452 --> 02:12:41.853
COULD PERHAPS CHANGE INTO IT TO

02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:43.155
A DIFFERENT MATERIAL OR A

02:12:43.221 --> 02:12:46.224
DIFFERENT TYPE AT LEAST TO SEE

02:12:46.291 --> 02:12:46.792
IF THAT WOULD ALLEVIATE THE

02:12:46.858 --> 02:12:48.994
PROBLEM. THANK YOU. WELL FOR A

02:12:49.061 --> 02:12:50.729
FEATHER ALAN ALL RIGHT WORK BUT

02:12:50.796 --> 02:12:52.431
I'M SINCE YES YOU MENTIONED

02:12:52.497 --> 02:12:53.465
THIS IS OUR INTERNATIONAL PANEL

02:12:53.532 --> 02:12:55.400
AND I'M I GUESS MY QUESTION TO

02:12:55.467 --> 02:12:56.935
THE LAST PANEL HOW TO DO IT-

02:12:57.002 --> 02:12:58.570
WHAT. THE BEST PRACTICES RATHER

02:12:58.637 --> 02:12:59.838
JURISDICTIONS AND I'D LOVE TO

02:12:59.905 --> 02:13:02.541
ASK OUR- FRIENDS FROM THE UK OR

02:13:02.607 --> 02:13:03.775
CANADA ELSEWHERE IF THERE ARE

02:13:03.842 --> 02:13:04.976
SOME GOOD EXAMPLES THAT THEY

02:13:05.043 --> 02:13:08.413
LIKE US TO KNOW ABOUT ON THE

02:13:08.480 --> 02:13:09.014
PUBLIC POLICY SIDE RELATING TO

02:13:09.081 --> 02:13:10.816
THESE. IT INTENSE. SCIENTIFIC

02:13:10.882 --> 02:13:12.284
CHALLENGES- THAT THE WE OUGHT

02:13:12.351 --> 02:13:13.318
TO BE AWARE OF YOUR IN

02:13:13.385 --> 02:13:15.387
CALIFORNIA WITH A B. IN THE U.

02:13:15.454 --> 02:13:21.727
AND U. K. CANADA OR ELSEWHERE.

02:13:21.793 --> 02:13:23.695
I GUESS I CAN I CAN GO AHEAD

02:13:23.762 --> 02:13:26.198
AND ANSWER FIRST- FIRST OF ALL

02:13:26.264 --> 02:13:27.599
I WOULD SAY THAT I.

02:13:27.666 --> 02:13:29.334
CALIFORNIA'S AHEAD OF THE CURVE

02:13:29.401 --> 02:13:30.869
RIGHT NOW I THINK IN TERMS OF

02:13:30.936 --> 02:13:34.206
TRYING TO. BETTER UNDERSTAND-

02:13:34.272 --> 02:13:35.407
THE EFFECTS OF DRINKING WATER

02:13:35.474 --> 02:13:37.342
REGULATING TO BE A TO HAVE TO

02:13:37.409 --> 02:13:38.977
MEASURE IT EXAGGERATED AND YOU

02:13:39.044 --> 02:13:41.380
KNOW BOTH. DR RIGHT AND MYSELF

02:13:41.446 --> 02:13:42.814
ARE BOTH ON HIS WORK WORKING

02:13:42.881 --> 02:13:45.751
GROUP'S WITH AND SCORED. I

02:13:45.817 --> 02:13:46.885
WOULD SAY SOME POLICIES THAT

02:13:46.952 --> 02:13:48.420
CANADA IS STARTING TO TAKE THAT

02:13:48.487 --> 02:13:50.088
I'VE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH OUR

02:13:50.155 --> 02:13:52.157
I'M- MORE AROUND SOURCE

02:13:52.224 --> 02:13:54.126
REDUCTION WILL END AND

02:13:54.192 --> 02:13:56.128
INCREASING AND SCIENTIFIC.

02:13:56.194 --> 02:13:57.262
AWARENESS SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT

02:13:57.329 --> 02:13:58.263
OF FUNDING THAT'S GONE TOWARDS

02:13:58.330 --> 02:14:01.666
SCIENCE AND IN CANADA. TO ASK

02:14:01.733 --> 02:14:02.968
QUESTIONS THAT RANGE FROM THE

02:14:03.034 --> 02:14:05.337
SOURCES THE FATE THAT AFFECTS

02:14:05.404 --> 02:14:08.039
TO BOTH WILDLIFE AND HUMANS- SO

02:14:08.106 --> 02:14:09.541
SCIENTIFIC FUNDING IS OBVIOUSLY

02:14:09.608 --> 02:14:11.076
VERY USEFUL BUT WE'RE ALSO

02:14:11.143 --> 02:14:13.545
STARTING TO SEE AN- LEGISLATION

02:14:13.612 --> 02:14:14.980
THAT INVOLVES BOTH DEBT

02:14:15.046 --> 02:14:17.015
REDUCTION OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC

02:14:17.082 --> 02:14:19.117
ITEMS THAT ARE. NOT AS

02:14:19.184 --> 02:14:20.719
SUSTAINABLY MANAGEABLE SO THEY

02:14:20.786 --> 02:14:22.421
CAN'T BE RECYCLED THAT ARE

02:14:22.487 --> 02:14:23.522
COMMONLY FOUND IN THE

02:14:23.588 --> 02:14:25.690
ENVIRONMENT AND- POSE RISKS TO

02:14:25.757 --> 02:14:27.793
WILDLIFE- AND WE'RE ALSO SEEING

02:14:27.859 --> 02:14:29.728
RECYCLING STANDARDS TO TRY TO

02:14:29.795 --> 02:14:31.263
INCREASE RECYCLABILITY TO TRY

02:14:31.329 --> 02:14:32.330
TO BUILD A MORE CIRCULAR

02:14:32.397 --> 02:14:34.266
ECONOMY. OR SEEN OR EXTENDED

02:14:34.332 --> 02:14:35.901
PRODUCER RESPONSIBILITY GOING

02:14:35.967 --> 02:14:37.669
ACROSS THE PROVINCES AND MORE

02:14:37.736 --> 02:14:39.137
HARMONIZED WASTE MANAGEMENT YOU

02:14:39.204 --> 02:14:44.609
CAN GET. GREAT I'M- AND I AM

02:14:44.676 --> 02:14:45.777
HAPPY TO. ANY OF THAT IN. WITH

02:14:45.844 --> 02:14:47.879
YOU BUT I THINK I THINK THERE

02:14:47.946 --> 02:14:48.513
REALLY GREAT THINGS COME OUT OF

02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:50.849
CALIFORNIA WAS AND DAHLE BEING

02:14:50.916 --> 02:14:52.484
WRITTEN SO DEATH. YOUR INTO

02:14:52.551 --> 02:14:55.787
SPACES WELL- AGUIAR-CURRY YOU

02:14:55.854 --> 02:15:00.392
ON THIS. RECYCLING MY CONCERN

02:15:00.459 --> 02:15:02.427
WITH RECYCLING IS. THAT IT

02:15:02.494 --> 02:15:04.362
DOESN'T MATTER A WHOLE LOT

02:15:04.429 --> 02:15:05.864
WHETHER A PLASTIC GOES INTO

02:15:05.931 --> 02:15:07.732
LANDFILL. OR WHETHER IT GETS

02:15:07.799 --> 02:15:10.368
RECYCLED IN TERMS OF THE

02:15:10.435 --> 02:15:11.970
POLLUTION THAT'S BECAUSE- SO

02:15:12.037 --> 02:15:16.274
OUR BIG PROBLEM IS REALLY-

02:15:16.341 --> 02:15:21.847
TIRES- LEADER- ILLEGAL DUMPING

02:15:21.913 --> 02:15:23.148
BECAUSE IT GOES INTO A LANDFILL

02:15:23.215 --> 02:15:25.050
THE CHANCES OF IT GOING

02:15:25.116 --> 02:15:28.320
SOMEWHERE ELSE IS VERY SMALL IF

02:15:28.386 --> 02:15:29.287
THE LANDFILL IS PROPERLY

02:15:29.354 --> 02:15:31.823
MANAGED. SO I THOUGHT I DON'T

02:15:31.890 --> 02:15:32.958
THINK RECYCLING IS GOING TO

02:15:33.024 --> 02:15:35.494
HELP WITH THIS PROBLEM BUT I'D

02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:36.094
BE GLAD FOR YOU TO CONTRADICT

02:15:36.161 --> 02:15:39.431
ME. SURE NOW I APPRECIATE THAT

02:15:39.498 --> 02:15:40.932
I THINK FROM A- REALLY A

02:15:40.999 --> 02:15:42.767
MICROPLASTIC PERSPECTIVE AND

02:15:42.834 --> 02:15:44.436
THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH PLASTIC

02:15:44.503 --> 02:15:46.404
IS GOING INTO THE ENVIRONMENT.

02:15:46.471 --> 02:15:48.106
I SURE WHETHER IT GOES INTO A

02:15:48.173 --> 02:15:49.908
CONTAINS LANDFILL OR INTO A

02:15:49.975 --> 02:15:51.543
RECYCLING FACILITY IT'S NOT

02:15:51.610 --> 02:15:53.245
GOING INTO THE ENVIRONMENT.

02:15:53.311 --> 02:15:56.348
HOWEVER I SOMETIMES WHEN WE

02:15:56.414 --> 02:15:57.682
RECYCLE OUR WASTE IT GETS

02:15:57.749 --> 02:15:58.917
SHIPPED ELSEWHERE AND SO IF IT

02:15:58.984 --> 02:16:01.186
GOES INTO GOES TO A COUNTRY

02:16:01.253 --> 02:16:03.121
THAT DOESN'THAVE THE SAME. I

02:16:03.188 --> 02:16:04.689
WASTE MANAGEMENT STANDARDS AS

02:16:04.756 --> 02:16:06.358
THE UNITED STATES THAN THAT

02:16:06.424 --> 02:16:08.493
MATERIAL AND CAN BE DUMPED INTO

02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:11.930
THE ENVIRONMENT- SO YES BUT I

02:16:11.997 --> 02:16:12.697
ALSO THINK IT'S REALLY

02:16:12.764 --> 02:16:14.499
IMPORTANT TO TRY TO CREATE

02:16:14.566 --> 02:16:15.800
MATERIALS THAT ARE MORE

02:16:15.867 --> 02:16:17.569
RECYCLABLE THAT DO BUILT INTO A

02:16:17.636 --> 02:16:19.271
MORE CIRCULAR ECONOMY BECAUSE

02:16:19.337 --> 02:16:20.839
IT GETS RID OF SOME OF THOSE

02:16:20.906 --> 02:16:22.073
SINGLE USE. ITEMS THAT ARE

02:16:22.140 --> 02:16:23.708
OFTEN JUST HOSTAGE BECAUSE WE

02:16:23.775 --> 02:16:24.943
DON'T VALUE THE MATERIAL AND

02:16:25.010 --> 02:16:27.145
WE'VE SORT OF- CREATING

02:16:27.212 --> 02:16:28.547
MATERIALS THAT ARE MORE LIKELY

02:16:28.613 --> 02:16:30.081
TO BE LITTERED SO I THINK AND

02:16:30.148 --> 02:16:32.217
MEDIAN LEE I AGREE WITH YOU IN

02:16:32.284 --> 02:16:33.785
THE LONG TERM- I THINK IT'S

02:16:33.852 --> 02:16:37.489
IMPORTANT. THANK YOU A LOT OF

02:16:37.556 --> 02:16:38.657
OTHER ALLEN WHICH IS WHATEVER

02:16:38.723 --> 02:16:40.158
WHEN I MET YES IF THERE'S ANY

02:16:40.225 --> 02:16:41.593
THOUGHTS FROM OUR OUR FRIEND

02:16:41.660 --> 02:16:43.328
FROM- THE U. K. RIGHT I WANT TO

02:16:43.395 --> 02:16:48.733
JOIN MY THANKS. AND YOU FOR

02:16:48.800 --> 02:16:49.968
STAYING UP- WE SHOULD HAVE THIS

02:16:50.035 --> 02:16:53.038
THIS YEAR IN THE MOST HERE.

02:16:53.104 --> 02:16:54.005
THAT'S FINE SIR COULD YOU ME OF

02:16:54.072 --> 02:16:55.473
THE A AFTER JUST A YOU COULD

02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:58.743
SPEAK TO SOME SOME. THAT WE

02:16:58.810 --> 02:16:59.911
WOULD YOU LIKE TO VIEW YOU

02:16:59.978 --> 02:17:01.179
THINK MIGHT BE THIS WE CAN

02:17:01.246 --> 02:17:02.213
LEARN FROM IN THE U. K. OF THE

02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:03.515
YEAR OR ELSEWHERE THAT YOU'VE

02:17:03.582 --> 02:17:05.150
BEEN TRACKING I UNDERSTAND

02:17:05.216 --> 02:17:05.917
YOU'RE YOU KNOW YOU'RE COMING

02:17:05.984 --> 02:17:07.319
AT THIS FROM A SCIENTIFIC

02:17:07.385 --> 02:17:07.852
PERSPECTIVE BUT OBVIOUSLY

02:17:07.919 --> 02:17:09.220
WE'RE- COMING OUT FROM A POLICY

02:17:09.287 --> 02:17:10.789
PERSPECTIVE I'D LOVE TO HEAR.

02:17:10.855 --> 02:17:12.791
SOME BEST PRACTICES YOU MIGHT

02:17:12.857 --> 02:17:14.025
BE AWARE OF. YEAH SHOULD

02:17:14.092 --> 02:17:17.028
ABSOLUTELY- I'M SORRY. AS SUCH

02:17:17.095 --> 02:17:22.167
TALK ABOUT THE- THEY HAVE. SAVE

02:17:22.233 --> 02:17:23.435
IT UP TO ADD PRECAUTION

02:17:23.501 --> 02:17:25.537
PRINCIPLE WHICH I THINK IS YOU

02:17:25.604 --> 02:17:27.038
NAY WHEN THERE'S A CERTAIN

02:17:27.105 --> 02:17:27.906
DEGREE OF SCIENTIFIC

02:17:27.973 --> 02:17:29.507
UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING

02:17:29.574 --> 02:17:31.776
SOMETHING AND SAY THEY'VE-

02:17:31.843 --> 02:17:34.646
RECOMMENDED STEPS TO MINIMIZE

02:17:34.713 --> 02:17:36.214
MICROPLASTICS RELEASED TO THE

02:17:36.281 --> 02:17:37.949
ENVIRONMENT SWITCH TO NOT

02:17:38.016 --> 02:17:39.684
SETTING REGULATE THREE STEIN

02:17:39.751 --> 02:17:41.286
BUT ITS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

02:17:41.353 --> 02:17:43.788
MEMBER STATES TO YOU FOR LIFE.

02:17:43.855 --> 02:17:47.225
IN THE U. K. WE'VE GOT A FEW

02:17:47.292 --> 02:17:49.527
DIFFERENT INITIATIVES SAY-

02:17:49.594 --> 02:17:50.462
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT

02:17:50.528 --> 02:17:53.064
WE BONDS WILL HAVE A TAX ON

02:17:53.131 --> 02:17:55.033
LIKE PLASTIC BAGS STRAWS AB OF

02:17:55.100 --> 02:17:59.971
COURSE IS A QUESTION A FAT HOW.

02:18:00.038 --> 02:18:01.106
MUCH THAT WILL M. HELP THE

02:18:01.172 --> 02:18:02.841
MICROPHONE IS. DOES NOT

02:18:02.907 --> 02:18:07.345
SUMMARIES. M. AS WELL AB UNLESS

02:18:07.412 --> 02:18:08.480
IT REALLY WENT WE'RE NOT IN A

02:18:08.546 --> 02:18:10.048
WAY THAT THE THING THAT I DON'T

02:18:10.115 --> 02:18:11.616
GET FRUSTRATED THAT IS THE I

02:18:11.683 --> 02:18:13.585
THINK A LOT OF THE STEPS THAT

02:18:13.652 --> 02:18:16.154
TAKEN. AT IN TERMS OF POLICY

02:18:16.221 --> 02:18:17.889
REGULATION AT THE MOMENT SEEMS

02:18:17.956 --> 02:18:19.658
TO BE FOCUSED ON REDUCING

02:18:19.724 --> 02:18:21.626
SINGLE USE PLASTIC **** IN ART

02:18:21.693 --> 02:18:23.228
SO TIGHTLY GOODS BUT ALSO

02:18:23.295 --> 02:18:27.699
RECYCLING OF BY PHASE ARENA

02:18:27.766 --> 02:18:30.068
STATE REALLY. HELP THE FIBRO TO

02:18:30.135 --> 02:18:32.837
CA. AS A TWO. I THINK YOU KNOW

02:18:32.904 --> 02:18:34.472
ONLY SEEMS LIKE WE'RE DOING

02:18:34.539 --> 02:18:35.340
BECAUSE WE'RE TACKLING PLASTIC

02:18:35.407 --> 02:18:37.475
CHEAP IT FROM MY- ONLY NAY THAT

02:18:37.542 --> 02:18:39.344
PAVE TIRE ON FIVE ZERO THEY-

02:18:39.411 --> 02:18:41.613
SOURCE. AB I THINK I JUST NEED

02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:43.581
BRING AGAINST THE CONVERSATION.

02:18:43.648 --> 02:18:46.818
AS WELL OKAY- WE NEED TO GET ON

02:18:46.885 --> 02:18:48.987
TO THE PANEL THREE UNLESS SOME

02:18:49.054 --> 02:18:50.588
OKAY WRITTEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER

02:18:50.655 --> 02:18:54.626
ALLOCATE. HALF THANK YOU ALL

02:18:54.693 --> 02:18:55.860
THIS IS. REALLY INTERESTED AND

02:18:55.927 --> 02:18:58.396
BEGAN REALLY DEPRESSING- BUT

02:18:58.463 --> 02:18:59.164
IT'S IMPORTANT WE MOVED AND

02:18:59.230 --> 02:19:01.566
FIND. SO I FOR DR OCKMAN WHO I

02:19:01.633 --> 02:19:04.836
KNOW HAS DONE- RESEARCH ON

02:19:04.903 --> 02:19:06.538
SOURCES AS WELL AND COMING BACK

02:19:06.604 --> 02:19:07.839
TO THAT QUESTION OF. SAID WHERE

02:19:07.906 --> 02:19:10.942
SURE ENERGY PLACED FIRST DO YOU

02:19:11.009 --> 02:19:13.545
HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT THE MOST.

02:19:13.611 --> 02:19:14.679
PREVALENT SOURCES OF

02:19:14.746 --> 02:19:15.780
MICROPLASTICS ARE IN THE

02:19:15.847 --> 02:19:17.115
ENVIRONMENT IS IT THE FIBERS IS

02:19:17.182 --> 02:19:19.651
OF THE TIRES WHERE SHOULD WE BE

02:19:19.718 --> 02:19:21.653
FOCUSING OUR ENERGY. YEAH

02:19:21.720 --> 02:19:23.688
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION I

02:19:23.755 --> 02:19:25.223
WAS. HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THE

02:19:25.290 --> 02:19:26.524
SAN FRANCISCO BAY PROJECT I'VE

02:19:26.591 --> 02:19:28.526
ALSO DONE SOME WORK UPSTREAM IN

02:19:28.593 --> 02:19:31.496
THE SACRAMENTO BEE DELTA- I

02:19:31.563 --> 02:19:33.498
THINK I WOULD SAY I COMPLETELY

02:19:33.565 --> 02:19:35.533
AGREE THAT TIRE DUST AND-

02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:37.936
MICROFIBERS NEED TO BE-

02:19:38.002 --> 02:19:39.404
SOMETHING THAT WE FOCUS ON I

02:19:39.471 --> 02:19:42.073
THINK WE CAN THINK ABOUT-

02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:43.775
RETIRES A BIT OF A WICKED

02:19:43.842 --> 02:19:45.410
PROBLEM AND IT'S A TOUGH ONE

02:19:45.477 --> 02:19:47.011
FOR MICROFIBRES AND PUTTING

02:19:47.078 --> 02:19:48.880
FILTERS ON WASHING MACHINES

02:19:48.947 --> 02:19:49.547
WILL ACTUALLY MAKE A

02:19:49.614 --> 02:19:51.149
DIFFERENCE. WE HAVE THE FILTERS

02:19:51.216 --> 02:19:53.485
ON THE WASHING MACHINES OF- TWO

02:19:53.551 --> 02:19:55.120
HUNDRED HOMES IN THE SMALL TOWN

02:19:55.186 --> 02:19:57.322
OF PARRY SOUND UP HERE FEEDS

02:19:57.388 --> 02:19:58.423
10% OF THE WASTE WATER KEEP

02:19:58.490 --> 02:19:59.557
TREATMENT PLANT WE'VE SEEN A

02:19:59.624 --> 02:20:02.494
REDUCTION OF MICROFIBERS BY 10%

02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:06.498
SINCE WE'VE DONE ESTO- IT MAKES

02:20:06.564 --> 02:20:07.398
THE DIFFERENCE. THE OTHER THING

02:20:07.465 --> 02:20:08.967
I WOULD SAY TO YOUR QUESTION IS

02:20:09.033 --> 02:20:10.168
IF WE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING

02:20:10.235 --> 02:20:11.436
QUICK AND I'D BE INTERESTED

02:20:11.503 --> 02:20:12.871
WHAT ON OTHERS THAT WOULD HAVE

02:20:12.937 --> 02:20:13.671
TO SAY ABOUT THIS FROM THE

02:20:13.738 --> 02:20:15.774
PANEL. IS FOCUSED ON PATHWAYS

02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:18.076
INSTEAD OF THE PRODUCT UPSTREAM

02:20:18.143 --> 02:20:19.811
I AGRICULTURAL RUNOFF

02:20:19.878 --> 02:20:21.112
STORMWATER RUNOFF AND

02:20:21.179 --> 02:20:22.647
WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS ARE

02:20:22.714 --> 02:20:24.616
ALL PATHWAYS THAT MICROPLASTICS

02:20:24.682 --> 02:20:25.517
GO THROUGH TO ENTER THE

02:20:25.583 --> 02:20:28.019
ENVIRONMENT- BY A RETENTION

02:20:28.086 --> 02:20:29.821
CELLS AND RAIN GARDENS ON STORM

02:20:29.888 --> 02:20:31.022
DRAINS WILL. PREVENT

02:20:31.089 --> 02:20:33.024
MICROPLASTICS FROM GETTING INTO

02:20:33.091 --> 02:20:35.426
THE ENVIRONMENT- CHANGING WASTE

02:20:35.493 --> 02:20:37.061
WATER TREATMENT PLANTS ARE

02:20:37.128 --> 02:20:37.729
TWENTY EIGHT I KNOW THAT'S VERY

02:20:37.796 --> 02:20:38.897
EXPENSIVE BUT THE FILTERS ON

02:20:38.963 --> 02:20:40.198
WASHING MACHINES CAN CERTAINLY

02:20:40.265 --> 02:20:42.367
HELP WHAT GOES INTO THEM. AND

02:20:42.433 --> 02:20:43.568
WITH ADDED RUNOFF WE CAN THINK

02:20:43.635 --> 02:20:45.570
ABOUT AND USING MAYBE WETLANDS

02:20:45.637 --> 02:20:47.405
ARE OTHER WAYS TO FILTER THE

02:20:47.472 --> 02:20:48.807
WATER BEFORE IT GOES OUT INTO

02:20:48.873 --> 02:20:50.775
THE ENVIRONMENT. AND THIS IS

02:20:50.842 --> 02:20:51.976
WHAT THE O. S. D. REPORT THAT

02:20:52.043 --> 02:20:53.812
COMES OUT THIS MONTH WILL FOCUS

02:20:53.878 --> 02:20:55.914
ON. I'M IN A MAJOR WAY IS WHAT

02:20:55.980 --> 02:20:57.715
ARE THOSE PATHWAYS AND HOW CAN

02:20:57.782 --> 02:20:59.584
WE PREVENT. OKAY L. THREE IS

02:20:59.651 --> 02:21:02.687
GOING TO FOCUS ON THIS AREA. SO

02:21:02.754 --> 02:21:04.823
WHY DON'T WE GET TWO PANEL

02:21:04.889 --> 02:21:08.993
THREE UNLESS SOMEONE. HAS A

02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:09.627
BURNING QUESTION. THANK YOU SO

02:21:09.694 --> 02:21:16.601
MUCH YEAH- GOOD. TO LAUNDER. SO

02:21:16.668 --> 02:21:19.804
PALE THREE. WOMEN EXPERTS IS A

02:21:19.871 --> 02:21:21.339
VERY STRONG STRATEGIES FOR MASS

02:21:21.406 --> 02:21:23.842
MY- POLLUTION. AND I USE THE

02:21:23.908 --> 02:21:25.844
TERM MAN LIVE BECAUSE THE SIZE

02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:28.179
STILL EMERGING ON MICROPLASTICS

02:21:28.246 --> 02:21:29.681
IS STILL MUCH TO STUDY AND

02:21:29.747 --> 02:21:30.648
UNDERSTAND ABOUT HOW

02:21:30.715 --> 02:21:33.184
MICROPLASTICS IMPACT OUR

02:21:33.251 --> 02:21:35.153
RESOURCES AND OUR BODIES. AND

02:21:35.220 --> 02:21:36.788
WITH THAT WE WILL NEED TO LEARN

02:21:36.855 --> 02:21:38.323
ABOUT AND POTENTIALLY DEVELOP

02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:40.825
TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN REMEDIATE

02:21:40.892 --> 02:21:44.596
MICROPLASTICS IN WATER SOIL.

02:21:44.662 --> 02:21:46.631
AND- PERHAPS EVEN THE AIR. IN

02:21:46.698 --> 02:21:48.399
THE MEANTIME WE NEED TO KNOW

02:21:48.466 --> 02:21:50.735
WHAT CAN BE DONE TODAY TO

02:21:50.802 --> 02:21:52.604
ADDRESS THIS TOXIC POLLUTION

02:21:52.670 --> 02:21:54.105
SOURCE REDUCTION WOULD BE THE

02:21:54.172 --> 02:21:56.241
MOST EFFICIENT. AND WASTE

02:21:56.307 --> 02:21:58.109
MANAGEMENT IS ALSO A GROUP

02:21:58.176 --> 02:22:00.511
CRITICAL STRATEGY. FIRST I'D

02:22:00.578 --> 02:22:02.747
LIKE TO INVITE DOCTOR FERAL

THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATIONAL

02:22:51.596 --> 02:22:53.898
HEARING. I ORIGINALLY CAME TO

02:22:53.965 --> 02:22:55.133
THIS PROBLEM FROM THE END OF

02:22:55.199 --> 02:22:56.734
THE PIPE SO BY THAT I MEAN THE

02:22:56.801 --> 02:22:58.770
OCEAN AND NOT ONLY FROM THE

02:22:58.836 --> 02:23:01.072
OCEAN BUT FROM THE DEAD END OF

02:23:01.139 --> 02:23:01.706
THE OCEAN THE SO CALLED GARBAGE

02:23:01.773 --> 02:23:03.441
PATCHES I'M A RESEARCH

02:23:03.508 --> 02:23:05.009
PROFESSOR OF OCEANOGRAPHY I'M

02:23:05.076 --> 02:23:06.644
TRAINED IN OCEAN PHYSICS AND

02:23:06.711 --> 02:23:07.612
I'VE BEEN ON THE FACULTY OF SEA

02:23:07.679 --> 02:23:09.714
EDUCATION ASSOCIATION R. S. C.

02:23:09.781 --> 02:23:10.915
A. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND

02:23:10.982 --> 02:23:12.517
THREE. I SEE IS A NONPROFIT

02:23:12.583 --> 02:23:14.018
EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATION OUR

02:23:14.085 --> 02:23:15.353
PRIMARY OFFERING IS THE SEA

02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:16.254
SEMESTER PROGRAM FOR

02:23:16.321 --> 02:23:17.755
UNDERGRADUATES FROM COLLEGES

02:23:17.822 --> 02:23:19.457
AND UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE

02:23:19.524 --> 02:23:21.025
COUNTRY AND INTERNATIONALLY

02:23:21.092 --> 02:23:22.226
STUDY WITH US FOR A SEMESTER

02:23:22.293 --> 02:23:23.628
BOTH ON OUR CAMPUS IN WOODS

02:23:23.695 --> 02:23:24.896
HOLE MASSACHUSETTS AND I'M ONE

02:23:24.963 --> 02:23:26.331
OF OUR TWO TALL SAILING SHIPS

02:23:26.397 --> 02:23:30.435
LIKE YOU SEE HERE THAT ARE ALSO

02:23:30.501 --> 02:23:32.070
OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH VESSELS.

02:23:32.136 --> 02:23:32.804
SO WHEN SAILING IN THE

02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:34.372
SUBTROPICAL LATITUDES OF THE

02:23:34.439 --> 02:23:35.173
NORTH ATLANTIC IN THE NORTH

02:23:35.239 --> 02:23:36.474
PACIFIC IN THE SO CALLED

02:23:36.541 --> 02:23:38.309
GARBAGE PATCHES AS WE DO WITH

02:23:38.376 --> 02:23:39.811
OUR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS.

02:23:39.877 --> 02:23:40.912
WHAT YOU WOULD TYPICALLY SEE

02:23:40.979 --> 02:23:42.113
FROM THE DECK OF A SHIP OR

02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:43.514
SOMETHING LIKE THAT STOP A NICE

02:23:43.581 --> 02:23:44.949
CALM DAY YOU'LL HAVE LIGHT

02:23:45.016 --> 02:23:46.284
WINDS AND NOT REALLY SEE

02:23:46.351 --> 02:23:49.887
ANYTHING BUT- WATER SKY CLOUDS.

02:23:49.954 --> 02:23:51.222
YOU WILL SEE FLOATING DEBRIS

02:23:51.289 --> 02:23:52.724
DRIFT BY AND THESE ARE

02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:54.058
TYPICALLY SINGULAR ITEMS

02:23:54.125 --> 02:23:55.760
SOMETIMES IDENTIFIABLE LIKE

02:23:55.827 --> 02:23:57.862
THIS BOOT. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT

02:23:57.929 --> 02:23:59.163
THESE ARE FRAGMENTS OF SOME

02:23:59.230 --> 02:24:01.399
ONCE LARGER OBJECT. BUT THERE

02:24:01.466 --> 02:24:02.767
MOST DEFINITELY PLASTIC

02:24:02.834 --> 02:24:04.736
FLOATING IN THE SEA SURFACE.

02:24:04.802 --> 02:24:05.570
BUT IF YOU TELL PLAN TO NOT

02:24:05.636 --> 02:24:06.637
THROUGH THE WATER AT THE SEA

02:24:06.704 --> 02:24:08.239
SURFACE FOR JUST THIRTY MINUTES

02:24:08.306 --> 02:24:09.240
AND SIFT THROUGH ITS CONTENTS

02:24:09.307 --> 02:24:10.675
YOU FIND SOMETHING THAT LOOKS

02:24:10.742 --> 02:24:11.809
LIKE THIS THESE ARE OF COURSE

02:24:11.876 --> 02:24:13.144
THE MICROPLASTICS THAT WE'VE

02:24:13.211 --> 02:24:14.612
BEEN TALKING ABOUT. IN THIS

02:24:14.679 --> 02:24:15.313
CASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:16.614
MICROPLASTICS THAT ARE ACTUALLY

02:24:16.681 --> 02:24:18.149
QUITE LARGE COMPARED TO THE

02:24:18.216 --> 02:24:19.717
MICROFIBERS AND SOME OF THIS

02:24:19.784 --> 02:24:21.119
THESE PARTICLES WERE. THAT

02:24:21.185 --> 02:24:22.120
WE'VE HEARD ABOUT IN THE LAST

02:24:22.186 --> 02:24:24.789
SESSION THAT ARE CARRIED BY

02:24:24.856 --> 02:24:27.658
ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION. SO ARE

02:24:27.725 --> 02:24:28.593
THE SEMESTER STUDENTS HAVE TEN

02:24:28.659 --> 02:24:29.627
POINT AND THAT'S THROUGH THE

02:24:29.694 --> 02:24:30.628
SERVICE OCEAN THE NORTH

02:24:30.695 --> 02:24:31.996
ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC OCEANS IN

02:24:32.063 --> 02:24:33.164
THE CARIBBEAN SEA FOR DECADES

02:24:33.231 --> 02:24:35.600
AND EXAMINE THEIR CONTENTS. AND

02:24:35.666 --> 02:24:37.201
IN THE REGION'S DUMP GARBAGE

02:24:37.268 --> 02:24:39.037
PATCHES THIS IS WHAT THE VAST

02:24:39.103 --> 02:24:40.071
AMOUNT OF DEBRIS COLLECTED

02:24:40.138 --> 02:24:41.639
CONSISTS OF ARE THESE PARTICLES

02:24:41.706 --> 02:24:43.207
SO COURSE YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE

02:24:43.274 --> 02:24:44.942
ABOUT WHERE THEY CAME FROM.

02:24:45.009 --> 02:24:46.344
MOST OF THESE PARTICLES DID

02:24:46.411 --> 02:24:47.678
ORIGINATE FROM LARGER PLASTIC

02:24:47.745 --> 02:24:49.447
ITEMS THAT WEEKEND AND BROKE

02:24:49.514 --> 02:24:49.981
APART WHEN EXPOSED IN THE

02:24:50.048 --> 02:24:52.083
ENVIRONMENT. BUT WHERE THIS

02:24:52.150 --> 02:24:53.284
DEGREE COMES THESE TINY

02:24:53.351 --> 02:24:55.987
FRAGMENTS- IT IS UNKNOWN HOW

02:24:56.054 --> 02:24:57.722
LONG THEY'VE BEEN THERE. WHERE

02:24:57.789 --> 02:24:58.790
THEY ORIGINATE GEOGRAPHIC

02:24:58.856 --> 02:25:00.425
ORIGINATED GEOGRAPHICALLY OR

02:25:00.491 --> 02:25:01.859
WHAT WHAT KIND OF ITEM THEY

02:25:01.926 --> 02:25:03.828
ORIGINATED FROM. WE DO HAVE

02:25:03.895 --> 02:25:04.762
PASSED THE SIZE THAT MOST OF

02:25:04.829 --> 02:25:06.064
THIS ORIGINATES ON LAND IN THIS

02:25:06.130 --> 02:25:08.966
IS REALLY WHERE WE'RE GETTING

02:25:09.033 --> 02:25:09.600
TO ON THE TOPIC OF THIS PANEL.

02:25:09.667 --> 02:25:11.135
SO FIVE YEARS AGO IN A STUDY

02:25:11.202 --> 02:25:12.403
LED BY MY COLLEAGUE JENNA

02:25:12.470 --> 02:25:13.337
JAMBECK AT UNIVERSITY OF

02:25:13.404 --> 02:25:14.705
GEORGIA GEORGIA THAT WAS A

02:25:14.772 --> 02:25:16.040
PRODUCT OF A WORKING GROUP I

02:25:16.107 --> 02:25:17.542
MARINE DEBRIS AT THE NATIONAL

02:25:17.608 --> 02:25:19.077
CENTER FOR ECOLOGICAL ANALYSIS

02:25:19.143 --> 02:25:21.245
AND SYNTHESIS- CENTER AT. UC

02:25:21.312 --> 02:25:23.214
SANTA BARBARA. WE ESTIMATED THE

02:25:23.281 --> 02:25:24.615
AMOUNT OF PLASTIC WASTE

02:25:24.682 --> 02:25:26.117
MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE GENERATED

02:25:26.184 --> 02:25:28.219
ON LAND THAT ENTER THE OCEAN IN

02:25:28.286 --> 02:25:29.754
TWO THOUSAND AND TEN. AND THE

02:25:29.821 --> 02:25:30.888
CANONICAL VALUE THAT EIGHT

02:25:30.955 --> 02:25:32.457
MILLION METRIC TONS OF SINCE

02:25:32.523 --> 02:25:33.591
BECOME A BENCHMARK OF THE

02:25:33.658 --> 02:25:35.593
ANNUAL SCALE OF OCEAN PLASTIC

02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:38.496
POLLUTION- THIS DOESN'T ACT

02:25:38.563 --> 02:25:41.065
THANK YOU. I'M FOR ALL OF THE

02:25:41.132 --> 02:25:42.633
SOURCE ABOUT ALWAYS GENERATED

02:25:42.700 --> 02:25:45.103
ON LAND. SO THE ESTIMATED

02:25:45.169 --> 02:25:53.277
PLASTIC WAIT. I'M PUT. FOR

02:25:53.344 --> 02:25:58.416
THANKS IS ALWAYS. THE RANKS IN

02:25:58.483 --> 02:26:02.453
SPADES. ON THE ACT TREES THIS

02:26:02.520 --> 02:26:03.888
MESSAGE ABOUT AN INFORMAL WASTE

02:26:03.955 --> 02:26:05.790
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM SO THIS COULD

02:26:05.857 --> 02:26:06.624
BE DUE TO A LACK OF

02:26:06.691 --> 02:26:08.192
INFRASTRUCTURE ITSELF OR IT

02:26:08.259 --> 02:26:10.094
COULD BE DUE TO ACCIDENTAL OR

02:26:10.161 --> 02:26:12.330
INTENTIONAL LITTERING. IN THIS

02:26:12.396 --> 02:26:13.498
STUDY WE FOUND THAT THE TOP

02:26:13.564 --> 02:26:14.632
EMITTING COUNTRIES WORLD IN

02:26:14.699 --> 02:26:15.867
SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST ASIA DO

02:26:15.933 --> 02:26:17.502
THEIR RAPIDLY GROWING ECONOMIES

02:26:17.568 --> 02:26:19.704
AND ASSOCIATED WASTE GENERATION

02:26:19.770 --> 02:26:20.571
BUT WITHOUT THE CAPACITY TO

02:26:20.638 --> 02:26:21.806
MANAGE THIS INCREASING AMOUNT

02:26:21.873 --> 02:26:23.708
OF WASTE. AND SO CONSEQUENTLY

02:26:23.774 --> 02:26:25.076
THIS REGION BECAME THE FOCUS OF

02:26:25.143 --> 02:26:26.577
MANY IMPORTANT AND URGENT

02:26:26.644 --> 02:26:29.080
REMEDIATION EFFORTS. HOWEVER AN

02:26:29.147 --> 02:26:30.448
OFTEN OVERLOOKED RESULT OF THAT

02:26:30.515 --> 02:26:32.116
WORK WAS THAT THE UNITED STATES

02:26:32.183 --> 02:26:33.184
RANKS TWENTIETH AND IT'S

02:26:33.251 --> 02:26:34.752
CONTRIBUTIONS OF PLASTIC WASTE

02:26:34.819 --> 02:26:36.087
OUT OF ONE HUNDRED NINETY TWO

02:26:36.154 --> 02:26:37.321
COUNTRIES. AND THE COASTAL

02:26:37.388 --> 02:26:38.089
COUNTRIES OF THE E. U.

02:26:38.156 --> 02:26:39.490
COLLECTIVELY RANKED EIGHTEENTH

02:26:39.557 --> 02:26:41.759
ON THIS GLOBAL LIST. SO DESPITE

02:26:41.826 --> 02:26:43.027
HAVING HIGHLY DEVELOPED AN

02:26:43.094 --> 02:26:44.162
EFFECTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT

02:26:44.228 --> 02:26:45.530
INFRASTRUCTURE THE UNITED

02:26:45.596 --> 02:26:47.698
STATES WAS A TOP CONTRIBUTOR.

02:26:47.765 --> 02:26:49.267
FOR A FEW REASONS ONE OF ITS

02:26:49.333 --> 02:26:51.536
LARGE COASTAL POPULATION. AND

02:26:51.602 --> 02:26:53.738
TO ITS VERY HIGH PLASTIC WASTE

02:26:53.804 --> 02:26:55.406
GENERATION RATES. SO IN THIS

02:26:55.473 --> 02:26:56.941
ANALYSIS THE VERY LARGE AMOUNTS

02:26:57.008 --> 02:26:58.476
OF MISMANAGED WASTE IN THE U.

02:26:58.543 --> 02:26:59.977
S. WERE SOLELY A CONSEQUENCE OF

02:27:00.044 --> 02:27:01.412
LITTERING WHICH WAS COARSELY

02:27:01.479 --> 02:27:03.147
ESTIMATED AS 2% OF PLASTIC

02:27:03.214 --> 02:27:05.850
WASTE GENERATION. ONE OF THE

02:27:05.917 --> 02:27:07.218
LIMITATIONS OF THE JAMBECK

02:27:07.285 --> 02:27:08.886
STUDY WAS THE VERY SPARSE DATA

02:27:08.953 --> 02:27:09.720
AVAILABLE FROM MANY COUNTRIES

02:27:09.787 --> 02:27:11.422
AROUND THE WORLD AS WELL AS A

02:27:11.489 --> 02:27:12.690
LACK OF STANDARDIZED

02:27:12.757 --> 02:27:13.524
MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING

02:27:13.591 --> 02:27:15.359
PROTOCOLS. AND EVEN WHEN THE

02:27:15.426 --> 02:27:16.827
DATA WERE AVAILABLE ACTIVITIES

02:27:16.894 --> 02:27:18.162
SUCH AS ILLEGAL DUMPING AND

02:27:18.229 --> 02:27:19.497
INTERNATIONAL TRADE OF PLASTIC

02:27:19.564 --> 02:27:21.832
WASTE THE DR RUCKMAN MENTIONED

02:27:21.899 --> 02:27:24.135
WERE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR. SO THIS

02:27:24.202 --> 02:27:25.803
MOTIVATED A NEW STUDY THAT WAS

02:27:25.870 --> 02:27:27.538
PUBLISHED TO OUR LAST OCTOBER

02:27:27.605 --> 02:27:28.873
WHERE WE LOOKED AT CLOSER LOOK

02:27:28.940 --> 02:27:30.474
AT PLASTIC WASTE GENERATION IN

02:27:30.541 --> 02:27:32.243
THE UNITED STATES SPECIFICALLY.

02:27:32.310 --> 02:27:33.811
AND THE FATE OF THAT WASTE WITH

02:27:33.878 --> 02:27:35.680
THE GOAL TO ESTIMATE ARE A

02:27:35.746 --> 02:27:37.515
RESPOND ESTIMATE OF THE LEAKAGE

02:27:37.582 --> 02:27:39.283
OF PLASTIC WASTE GENERATED IN

02:27:39.350 --> 02:27:40.551
THE UNITED STATES TO THE

02:27:40.618 --> 02:27:42.787
ENVIRONMENT GLOBALLY. SO FIRST

02:27:42.853 --> 02:27:45.156
WE IS NEWLY AVAILABLE DATA-

02:27:45.223 --> 02:27:46.791
WITHIN OUR COUNTRY TO REFINE

02:27:46.857 --> 02:27:48.025
THE ESTIMATE OF PLASTIC WASTE

02:27:48.092 --> 02:27:50.094
GENERATED. AND WE FOUND THAT

02:27:50.161 --> 02:27:51.862
NUMBER TO BE A STAGGERING FORTY

02:27:51.929 --> 02:27:53.130
TWO MILLION METRIC TONS IN THE

02:27:53.197 --> 02:27:54.732
YEAR TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT'S THE

02:27:54.799 --> 02:27:55.666
DATE OF THE MOST RECENT DATA

02:27:55.733 --> 02:27:57.168
AVAILABLE. AND THIS WAS THE

02:27:57.235 --> 02:27:58.736
HIGHEST OF ANY COUNTRY IN THE

02:27:58.803 --> 02:27:59.937
WORLD IN THE UNITED STATES WE

02:28:00.004 --> 02:28:01.272
MAKE MORE PLASTIC TRASH THAN

02:28:01.339 --> 02:28:03.441
ANYONE ELSE. NEXT WE

02:28:03.507 --> 02:28:04.642
INVESTIGATED HOW MUCH OF THE

02:28:04.709 --> 02:28:06.577
WASTE WAS INADEQUATELY MANAGED

02:28:06.644 --> 02:28:07.845
IN THE UNITED STATES DUE TO

02:28:07.912 --> 02:28:09.847
BOTH LITTERING. AND ILLEGAL

02:28:09.914 --> 02:28:11.515
DUMPING. AND TOGETHER THESE

02:28:11.582 --> 02:28:12.717
PRACTICES ACCOUNTED FOR

02:28:12.783 --> 02:28:13.985
APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION

02:28:14.051 --> 02:28:15.553
METRIC TONS OF PLASTIC WASTE

02:28:15.620 --> 02:28:17.421
DISPOSED INTO THE ENVIRONMENT

02:28:17.488 --> 02:28:19.857
WITHIN OUR OWN BORDERS. FINALLY

02:28:19.924 --> 02:28:21.659
WE ESTIMATED THE EXPORT OF

02:28:21.726 --> 02:28:23.261
PLASTIC WASTE COLLECTED IN THE

02:28:23.327 --> 02:28:25.496
UNITED STATES FOR RECYCLING. SO

02:28:25.563 --> 02:28:27.331
FOR MANY YEARS WE HAVE EXPORTED

02:28:27.398 --> 02:28:29.166
BALES OF PLASTICS CALLED

02:28:29.233 --> 02:28:30.268
PLASTIC SCRAP TO COUNTRIES

02:28:30.334 --> 02:28:32.136
AROUND THE WORLD FOR

02:28:32.203 --> 02:28:33.971
REPROCESSING OR RECYCLING.

02:28:34.038 --> 02:28:35.773
USING TRADE DATA WE DETERMINED

02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:37.808
THAT 51% OF THE PLASTICS

02:28:37.875 --> 02:28:39.176
COLLECTED FOR RECYCLING IN THE

02:28:39.243 --> 02:28:42.280
U. S. FOR EXPORTED EIGHTY NINE

02:28:42.346 --> 02:28:44.582
TRADE PARTNERS MOST OF. HIS

02:28:44.649 --> 02:28:46.250
NAME MOST OF WHOM ARE ALREADY

02:28:46.317 --> 02:28:47.051
STRUGGLING TO MANAGE THEIR OWN

02:28:47.118 --> 02:28:48.919
DOMESTIC WASTE SO THE WAY I

02:28:48.986 --> 02:28:49.987
LIKE TO THINK OF THIS IS HALF

02:28:50.054 --> 02:28:51.956
OF WHAT I PUT IN THE BLUE BIN.

02:28:52.023 --> 02:28:53.090
WAS SHIPPED LARGELY TO CHINA

02:28:53.157 --> 02:28:54.692
AS- WELL USING THE DATA FROM

02:28:54.759 --> 02:28:55.760
DATA FROM STUDIES OF THE

02:28:55.826 --> 02:28:57.561
COMPOSITION OF THE SCRAPPY ELS

02:28:57.628 --> 02:28:58.896
WE CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATED THE

02:28:58.963 --> 02:29:00.431
AMOUNT OF PLASTIC MATERIAL THAT

02:29:00.498 --> 02:29:01.165
WOULD LIKELY HAVE BEEN

02:29:01.232 --> 02:29:03.934
DISCARDED- IN THOSE PROCESSING

02:29:04.001 --> 02:29:04.535
FACILITIES BECAUSE IT WAS OF

02:29:04.602 --> 02:29:06.370
LOW VALUE. AND IN THOSE

02:29:06.437 --> 02:29:07.738
COUNTRIES WITH HIGH PROPORTIONS

02:29:07.805 --> 02:29:09.140
OF MISMANAGED WASTE WE

02:29:09.206 --> 02:29:11.175
ESTIMATED THAT BETWEEN TWENTY

02:29:11.242 --> 02:29:13.311
FIVE AND 75% OF THAT DISCARDED

02:29:13.377 --> 02:29:14.679
MATERIAL WAS DISPOSED OF

02:29:14.745 --> 02:29:15.846
DIRECTLY INTO THE ENVIRONMENT

02:29:15.913 --> 02:29:18.316
BY OPEN. DUMPING OR OPEN

02:29:18.382 --> 02:29:20.084
BURNING BURNING. SO THE

02:29:20.151 --> 02:29:21.519
ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF PLASTIC

02:29:21.585 --> 02:29:22.520
WASTE COLLECTED THE U. S. FOR

02:29:22.586 --> 02:29:24.388
RECYCLING. THAT WAS EXPORTED

02:29:24.455 --> 02:29:25.356
AND LIKELY ENTERED THE

02:29:25.423 --> 02:29:26.524
ENVIRONMENT OF THE COUNTRY

02:29:26.590 --> 02:29:28.359
PROCESSING THAT WASTE. ABROAD

02:29:28.426 --> 02:29:30.428
IS UP TO AN ADDITIONAL ONE

02:29:30.494 --> 02:29:32.797
MILLION METRIC TONS. AND

02:29:32.863 --> 02:29:34.799
FINALLY FOR COMPARISON TO THAT

02:29:34.865 --> 02:29:35.666
TWENTY TEN JAMAICAN ALICE'S WE

02:29:35.733 --> 02:29:36.701
CALCULATED THE AMOUNT OF

02:29:36.767 --> 02:29:38.069
PLASTIC WASTE GENERATED BY

02:29:38.135 --> 02:29:40.571
COASTAL POPULATIONS. IN THE

02:29:40.638 --> 02:29:41.872
FIFTY COUNTRIES THAT GENERATED

02:29:41.939 --> 02:29:43.074
THE HIGHEST AMOUNTS OF PLASTIC

02:29:43.140 --> 02:29:45.609
WASTE AND WE FOUND THAT IN

02:29:45.676 --> 02:29:46.510
TWENTY SIXTEEN UNITED STATES

02:29:46.577 --> 02:29:47.845
RANKED AS HIGH AS THIRD

02:29:47.912 --> 02:29:49.347
GLOBALLY AND IT'S CONTRIBUTIONS

02:29:49.413 --> 02:29:51.182
OF MISMANAGED PLASTIC WASTE THE

02:29:51.248 --> 02:29:54.151
COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS. WELL I

02:29:54.218 --> 02:29:55.820
THINK IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING

02:29:55.886 --> 02:29:56.854
BUT I'LL SAY IT ANYWAY THAT

02:29:56.921 --> 02:29:58.456
WE'RE FACING A GLOBAL CRISIS OF

02:29:58.522 --> 02:30:00.024
RAPIDLY INCREASING AMOUNTS OF

02:30:00.091 --> 02:30:01.826
PLASTIC WASTE FAR TOO MUCH OF

02:30:01.892 --> 02:30:03.861
WHICH ENDS UP IN OUR SOILS OUR

02:30:03.928 --> 02:30:06.130
WATERWAYS AND THE OCEAN. AND AS

02:30:06.197 --> 02:30:07.932
THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF PLASTIC

02:30:07.998 --> 02:30:09.467
WASTE IN THE WORLD THE UNITED

02:30:09.533 --> 02:30:11.202
STATES MUST ACT TO

02:30:11.268 --> 02:30:12.403
SIMULTANEOUSLY REDUCE THE

02:30:12.470 --> 02:30:13.738
AMOUNT OF WASTE WE GENERATE

02:30:13.804 --> 02:30:15.272
PLASTIC WASTE THAT WE GENERATE.

02:30:15.339 --> 02:30:16.440
BUT ALSO TAKE FULL

02:30:16.507 --> 02:30:17.508
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS

02:30:17.575 --> 02:30:19.877
REPROCESSING AND OUT ALTERNATE

02:30:19.944 --> 02:30:22.079
DISPOSAL WITHIN OUR OWN BORDERS.

02:30:22.146 --> 02:30:24.148
SO SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT WAYS

02:30:24.215 --> 02:30:26.150
FORWARD TO PREVENT PLASTIC

02:30:26.217 --> 02:30:28.219
POLLUTION. I THINK THE MOST

02:30:28.285 --> 02:30:29.653
STRAIGHTFORWARD SOLUTION HAS

02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:30.755
ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED TO THE

02:30:30.821 --> 02:30:32.256
PLASTIC WASTE PROBLEM IS TO

02:30:32.323 --> 02:30:33.290
CREATE LESS WASTE IN THE FIRST

02:30:33.357 --> 02:30:35.059
PLACE. SO THERE ARE MANY

02:30:35.126 --> 02:30:36.327
APPROACHES TO REDUCE PLASTIC

02:30:36.394 --> 02:30:37.928
WASTE GENERATION SOME OF THESE

02:30:37.995 --> 02:30:39.597
MIGHT INCLUDE BANDS OR

02:30:39.663 --> 02:30:42.066
DISINCENTIVES FOR UNNECESSARY

02:30:42.133 --> 02:30:44.168
USE. SO EXAMPLES ARE THINGS

02:30:44.235 --> 02:30:45.803
LIKE THE BIKER READ FREE WATERS

02:30:45.870 --> 02:30:47.605
ACTOR THE FEES FOR BAGS OR

02:30:47.671 --> 02:30:49.607
STRAWS OR EVEN FEES TO PRODUCT

02:30:49.673 --> 02:30:51.642
MANUFACTURERS TO INCENTIVIZE

02:30:51.709 --> 02:30:53.043
USING LESS PLASTIC THAT WILL BE

02:30:53.110 --> 02:30:54.845
DISPOSED OF. YOU CAN ALSO

02:30:54.912 --> 02:30:56.414
DESIGN PRODUCTS FOR REPAIR

02:30:56.480 --> 02:30:58.516
REUSE TO DELAY DISPOSAL OR

02:30:58.582 --> 02:30:59.817
CREATE NEW SYSTEMS FOR PRODUCT

02:30:59.884 --> 02:31:02.086
DELIVERY AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO

02:31:02.153 --> 02:31:04.422
SINGLE USE PACKAGING. I THINK

02:31:04.488 --> 02:31:05.523
IT'S CRITICAL THAT WITHIN THE

02:31:05.589 --> 02:31:07.425
U. S. WE ADDRESS LOCATION

02:31:07.491 --> 02:31:09.360
SPECIFIC DRIVERS OF ILLEGAL

02:31:09.427 --> 02:31:11.562
DUMPING AND LITTERING SO ASKING

02:31:11.629 --> 02:31:13.030
WHY ARE PEOPLE LITTERING WHY

02:31:13.097 --> 02:31:14.298
ARE PEOPLE PARK PARTICIPATING

02:31:14.365 --> 02:31:15.900
IN ILLEGAL DUMPING AND CAN WE

02:31:15.966 --> 02:31:18.002
REMOVE THE BARRIERS TO PROPER

02:31:18.068 --> 02:31:20.037
WASTE MANAGEMENT. I THINK WE

02:31:20.104 --> 02:31:22.740
NEED TO THINK ABOUT- DESIGN OF

02:31:22.807 --> 02:31:24.275
EXISTING PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING

02:31:24.341 --> 02:31:25.709
AND POTENTIALLY REDESIGN OF

02:31:25.776 --> 02:31:28.345
MATERIALS SO THAT THESE ARE

02:31:28.412 --> 02:31:29.580
CREATED WITH END OF LIFE

02:31:29.647 --> 02:31:30.948
MANAGEMENT AND LINES AND

02:31:31.015 --> 02:31:32.616
IDEALLY MAXIMIZING RECOVERY OF

02:31:32.683 --> 02:31:33.984
THOSE MATERIALS IN A CIRCULAR

02:31:34.051 --> 02:31:35.653
ECONOMY IS AS AS ALREADY BEEN

02:31:35.719 --> 02:31:38.589
MENTIONED. AND JUST TO-

02:31:38.656 --> 02:31:40.491
REEMPHASIZE THAT IT'S REALLY

02:31:40.558 --> 02:31:42.159
CRITICAL THAT WE EVALUATE THE

02:31:42.226 --> 02:31:43.527
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES OF

02:31:43.594 --> 02:31:44.662
THE MATERIAL LEAKAGE SO THE

02:31:44.728 --> 02:31:46.764
PERSISTENCE. THE BREAKDOWN

02:31:46.831 --> 02:31:47.531
WHICH REALLY MEANS THE

02:31:47.598 --> 02:31:48.699
FRAGMENTATION INTO SMALLER

02:31:48.766 --> 02:31:50.401
PARTICLES AND THINGS THAT AND

02:31:50.468 --> 02:31:51.302
ALSO THINKING ABOUT THE

02:31:51.368 --> 02:31:53.471
CHEMICAL DEGRADATION PRODUCTS

02:31:53.537 --> 02:31:54.805
AND ALSO THE IMPACTS ON THE

02:31:54.872 --> 02:31:56.974
ECOSYSTEM AND HUMAN HEALTH SO

02:31:57.041 --> 02:31:58.742
THAT WE CAN START TO PRIORITIZE

02:31:58.809 --> 02:31:59.710
PARTICULAR ITEMS ARE

02:31:59.777 --> 02:32:03.347
APPLICATIONS. AND BEGIN TO

02:32:03.414 --> 02:32:05.516
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. THANK YOU.

02:32:05.583 --> 02:32:08.452
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DR LAW AND

02:32:08.519 --> 02:32:10.020
NEXT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM

02:32:10.087 --> 02:32:12.756
ELISABETH. DR ELIZABETH FAST

02:32:12.823 --> 02:32:14.592
MAN BACK. WITH THE SOUTHERN

02:32:14.658 --> 02:32:16.460
CALIFORNIA COASTAL WATER

02:32:16.527 --> 02:32:18.162
RESEARCH PROJECTS. TO TALK

02:32:18.229 --> 02:32:20.331
ABOUT STORMWATER AS A CONDUIT

02:32:20.397 --> 02:32:22.132
FOR PLASTIC POLLUTION AND

02:32:22.199 --> 02:32:25.469
CURRENT STORMWATER BEST

02:32:25.536 --> 02:32:30.808
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. OKAY JUST.

02:32:30.875 --> 02:32:36.013
SHARE MY SCREEN. THANKS

02:32:36.080 --> 02:32:39.350
EVERYBODY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY

02:32:39.416 --> 02:32:42.920
TO. SPEAK WITH YOU I AM ONE

02:32:42.987 --> 02:32:45.623
WELL THAT'S COMING OUT. MY NAME

02:32:45.689 --> 02:32:47.324
IS DR ELIZABETH FASTENING BACK

02:32:47.391 --> 02:32:49.360
I AM A PRINCIPAL ENGINEER WITH

02:32:49.426 --> 02:32:51.962
SQUARE YOU'VE HEARD SCRIPT

02:32:52.029 --> 02:32:55.966
MENTIONED A FEW TIMES I THINK-

02:32:56.033 --> 02:32:58.235
MY RESEARCH FOCUSES ON STORM

02:32:58.302 --> 02:33:00.004
WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS WHICH

02:33:00.070 --> 02:33:01.405
ARE KNOWN COLLECTIVELY AS BEST

02:33:01.472 --> 02:33:04.441
MANAGEMENT PRACTICES SO I'M

02:33:04.508 --> 02:33:07.578
GONNA TALK TO YOU TODAY OF-

02:33:07.645 --> 02:33:08.178
BRING UP SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT

02:33:08.245 --> 02:33:12.016
WHETHER. D. N. P. IS OFFER US-

02:33:12.082 --> 02:33:13.417
SOLUTIONS ARE FEASIBLE

02:33:13.484 --> 02:33:15.653
SOLUTIONS FOR MANAGING

02:33:15.719 --> 02:33:18.489
MICROPLASTICS. THERE ARE THREE

02:33:18.556 --> 02:33:20.724
KINDS OF OPPORTUNITIES I SEE

02:33:20.791 --> 02:33:22.760
BROADLY SPEAKING AS FOR

02:33:22.826 --> 02:33:24.995
MANAGING MICROPLASTICS AS THEY

02:33:25.062 --> 02:33:27.298
MOVE THROUGH THE ENVIRONMENT

02:33:27.364 --> 02:33:27.898
ONE OF COURSE YOU JUST HEARD A

02:33:27.965 --> 02:33:29.733
WHOLE. YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT

02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:31.502
ITS SOURCE CONTROL WHERE WE TRY

02:33:31.569 --> 02:33:33.070
TO ELIMINATE OR MINIMIZE THE

02:33:33.137 --> 02:33:35.873
PROBLEM WHERE IT STARTS. I

02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:37.675
WE'VE HEARD A LOT THAT STORM

02:33:37.741 --> 02:33:39.777
WATER IS A MAJOR- I HAD

02:33:39.843 --> 02:33:41.745
MECHANISM FOR MOVING PLASTICS

02:33:41.812 --> 02:33:43.347
MICROPLASTICS TO THE

02:33:43.414 --> 02:33:45.449
ENVIRONMENT TO THE OCEAN SO I

02:33:45.516 --> 02:33:46.417
NEXT OPPORTUNITY IS WITHIN THE

02:33:46.483 --> 02:33:48.319
URBAN DRAINAGE SYSTEM WHERE

02:33:48.385 --> 02:33:49.820
FROM A SOLUTION STANDPOINT

02:33:49.887 --> 02:33:51.021
WE'RE TRYING TO ELIMINATE MY

02:33:51.088 --> 02:33:52.990
CAR CHECK PLASTICS TRANSPORT BY

02:33:53.057 --> 02:33:54.191
EITHER TREATING CAPTURED

02:33:54.258 --> 02:33:56.827
STORMWATER. OR MINIMIZING HOW

02:33:56.894 --> 02:33:59.964
MUCH STORM WITH- SLOWS DOWN THE

02:34:00.030 --> 02:34:01.799
STREAM. AND THESE TWO

02:34:01.865 --> 02:34:03.567
OBJECTIVES ARE REALLY WHAT M.

02:34:03.634 --> 02:34:05.869
P.'S LONG TO DO FOR OTHER

02:34:05.936 --> 02:34:09.106
REASONS- FOR VIRTUALLY ALL

02:34:09.173 --> 02:34:11.642
OTHER TYPES OF POLLUTANTS. IN

02:34:11.709 --> 02:34:13.510
RUN OFF. AND FINALLY THE LAST

02:34:13.577 --> 02:34:14.745
SOLUTION IS FILTERING MASS

02:34:14.812 --> 02:34:16.780
QUANTITIES OF OCEAN WATER AT

02:34:16.847 --> 02:34:18.248
THE END OF PIPE WHICH I DON'T

02:34:18.315 --> 02:34:19.850
THINK IS REALLY A VIABLE

02:34:19.917 --> 02:34:20.951
SOLUTION SO WE'LL JUST. SEND

02:34:21.018 --> 02:34:22.019
THAT OUT OF IT SO I'M GONNA

02:34:22.086 --> 02:34:24.321
FOCUS AND BMPS. AND WHAT

02:34:24.388 --> 02:34:28.258
OPPORTUNITIES THERE MAY BE OR-

02:34:28.325 --> 02:34:30.494
THAT BRING UP QUESTIONS. I'D

02:34:30.561 --> 02:34:31.629
THROUGHOUT THE URBAN LANDSCAPE

02:34:31.695 --> 02:34:32.730
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF

02:34:32.796 --> 02:34:33.397
OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE CAN

02:34:33.464 --> 02:34:35.733
CONSIDER. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN

02:34:35.799 --> 02:34:37.034
SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

02:34:37.101 --> 02:34:38.769
OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS

02:34:38.836 --> 02:34:40.070
TO INSTALL TRASH CAPTURE

02:34:40.137 --> 02:34:41.905
SYSTEMS WITHIN THE URBAN

02:34:41.972 --> 02:34:44.308
DRAINAGE NETWORK. CASH CAPTURE

02:34:44.375 --> 02:34:46.110
SYSTEMS ARE FOCUSED ON REMOVING

02:34:46.176 --> 02:34:48.612
PARTICLES AND DEBRIS THAT ARE

02:34:48.679 --> 02:34:50.481
LARGER THAN FIVE MILLIMETERS. I

02:34:50.547 --> 02:34:52.383
HAVEN'T AND IT BECAUSE THERE IS

02:34:52.449 --> 02:34:53.617
A QUESTION OF SCALE HERE I

02:34:53.684 --> 02:34:55.653
QUICKLY FIGURED OUT THAT- FIVE

02:34:55.719 --> 02:34:57.121
MILLIMETERS IS ABOUT THE SIZE

02:34:57.187 --> 02:34:58.922
OF YOUR PENCIL ERASER. OR

02:34:58.989 --> 02:35:00.024
WHATEVER WHEN WE USE THESE

02:35:00.090 --> 02:35:02.860
PENCILS I'D SAY THE QUESTION IS

02:35:02.926 --> 02:35:06.363
THAT AT TECHNOLOGY THAT'S USED

02:35:06.430 --> 02:35:07.798
TO THAT. IS DIRECTED AT. FIVE

02:35:07.865 --> 02:35:09.767
MILLIMETERS OR LARGER GOING TO

02:35:09.833 --> 02:35:11.635
BE EFFECTIVE FOR MICROPLASTICS

02:35:11.702 --> 02:35:13.370
WHICH BY DEFINITION ARE SMALLER

02:35:13.437 --> 02:35:15.572
THAN FIVE MILLIMETRES. WE HAVE

02:35:15.639 --> 02:35:18.709
ANOTHER SUITE OF BNP'S THAT ARE

02:35:18.776 --> 02:35:21.111
CONSIDERED TREATMENT BMPS AND

02:35:21.178 --> 02:35:21.912
THERE ARE LOTS OF DIFFERENT

02:35:21.979 --> 02:35:23.681
TECHNOLOGIES TYPES OF

02:35:23.747 --> 02:35:24.715
TECHNOLOGY WITHIN THE

02:35:24.782 --> 02:35:28.052
CATEGORIES OF CHEAP OF BMPS AND

02:35:28.118 --> 02:35:29.720
THEIR TWO THAT KIND OF GIVE US.

02:35:29.787 --> 02:35:31.088
MAYBE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:35:31.155 --> 02:35:33.190
TREATING MICROPLASTICS WATER

02:35:33.257 --> 02:35:35.359
FILTRATION TYPE BMPS AND THE

02:35:35.426 --> 02:35:38.929
OTHER ARE BROAD SUITE OF BMPS

02:35:38.996 --> 02:35:39.463
THAT SOAK RUN OFF INTO THE

02:35:39.530 --> 02:35:41.131
GROUND. AND THEN FUNDAMENTAL

02:35:41.198 --> 02:35:43.033
THERE IS WHETHER OR NOT THERE

02:35:43.100 --> 02:35:45.202
ARE ENOUGH STORMWATER THERE IS

02:35:45.269 --> 02:35:47.871
ENOUGH STORM WATER CAPTURE BY

02:35:47.938 --> 02:35:49.640
BMPS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AT A

02:35:49.707 --> 02:35:52.876
LARGE SCALE SO TRUST CAPTURE

02:35:52.943 --> 02:35:54.712
SYSTEM HOW DO THEY WORK AS I

02:35:54.778 --> 02:35:55.746
SAID THEY'RE DESIGNED TO

02:35:55.813 --> 02:35:57.614
CAPTURE LARGE PARTICLES AND

02:35:57.681 --> 02:36:00.017
DEBRIS. THERE ARE THREE MAJOR

02:36:00.084 --> 02:36:02.119
CATEGORIES OF TRASH CAPTURE

02:36:02.186 --> 02:36:03.387
SYSTEMS THAT ARE BEING

02:36:03.454 --> 02:36:04.555
INSTALLED ALL THROUGHOUT THE

02:36:04.621 --> 02:36:05.956
URBAN DRAINAGE NETWORKS IN

02:36:06.023 --> 02:36:08.025
CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE LOTS OF

02:36:08.092 --> 02:36:09.760
INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS THAT YOU

02:36:09.827 --> 02:36:11.462
CAN FIND WITHIN EACH OF THESE

02:36:11.528 --> 02:36:14.598
CATEGORIES BUT HERE THE THREE

02:36:14.665 --> 02:36:16.633
WAYS IN WHICH THEY WORK. YES WE

02:36:16.700 --> 02:36:18.936
A STORM DRAIN INSERTS WHICH ARE

02:36:19.002 --> 02:36:21.405
BASICALLY LARGE MESH TRAPS OR

02:36:21.472 --> 02:36:23.841
SCREENS THAT CLEAN OUT DEBRIS

02:36:23.907 --> 02:36:25.409
WITHOUT IMPEDING THE FLOW

02:36:25.476 --> 02:36:27.111
THROUGH THE STORMWATER NETWORK.

02:36:27.177 --> 02:36:28.712
REMEMBER FIVE MILLIMETERS IS

02:36:28.779 --> 02:36:30.080
BECAUSE YOUR PENCIL SO WE'RE

02:36:30.147 --> 02:36:31.548
NOT TALKING SKILLS TYPING

02:36:31.615 --> 02:36:35.352
SKILLS REMOVING YOUR WINDOW

02:36:35.419 --> 02:36:35.886
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PRETTY

02:36:35.953 --> 02:36:37.488
LARGE CHUNKS. BAFFLE BOXES AND

02:36:37.554 --> 02:36:39.556
HYDRODYNAMIC SEPARATORS ARE TWO

02:36:39.623 --> 02:36:41.358
CLASSES OF- TRASH CAPTURE

02:36:41.425 --> 02:36:43.260
SYSTEMS THAT ARE INSTALLED

02:36:43.327 --> 02:36:45.395
BELOW GROUND. THERE IN LINE

02:36:45.462 --> 02:36:47.765
WITH THE STORMS THE STORM DRAIN

02:36:47.831 --> 02:36:51.201
STORY THE STORM A STORM WATER

02:36:51.268 --> 02:36:55.072
NETWORK- WHERE- SO IT'S IN LINE

02:36:55.139 --> 02:36:55.539
WITH YOUR PIPE NETWORK

02:36:55.606 --> 02:36:57.307
UNDERGROUND IN A BAFFLE BOX

02:36:57.374 --> 02:36:59.309
USUALLY HAVE THIS ARRANGEMENT

02:36:59.376 --> 02:37:00.878
OF THAT SAME KIND OF LARGE

02:37:00.944 --> 02:37:03.881
SIZE- MESH SCREEN. AND THEN THE

02:37:03.947 --> 02:37:05.482
BATTLE'S CREATE THE STAGNANT

02:37:05.549 --> 02:37:07.584
ZONES WERE HEAVIER PARTICLES

02:37:07.651 --> 02:37:09.720
CAN SETTLE OUT BY GRAVITY. IN A

02:37:09.787 --> 02:37:11.755
HYDRODYNAMIC SEPARATOR IT

02:37:11.822 --> 02:37:13.891
CREATES A SWIRLING ACTION THAT

02:37:13.957 --> 02:37:16.393
SALARY- AND SEPARATE STATE

02:37:16.460 --> 02:37:18.262
HEAVIER PARTICLES AND DEBRIS TO

02:37:18.328 --> 02:37:19.763
SEPARATE OUT OF THE WATER AND

02:37:19.830 --> 02:37:21.098
FALL TO THE BOTTOM. AND THEN

02:37:21.165 --> 02:37:23.100
YOU HAVE A BACKTRACK AND BACK

02:37:23.167 --> 02:37:24.468
TO BACKING TRACK THAT COMES

02:37:24.535 --> 02:37:25.502
ALONG EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE AND

02:37:25.569 --> 02:37:28.705
SUCKS OUT THE DEBRIS THAT'S

02:37:28.772 --> 02:37:30.541
CAUGHT IN THE SYSTEMS. SO ALL.

02:37:30.607 --> 02:37:32.876
I SORRY ULTIMATELY EVERY SINGLE

02:37:32.943 --> 02:37:34.011
ONE OF THE SYSTEMS ARE AIMED AT

02:37:34.077 --> 02:37:36.580
VERY LARGE PARTICLES AND-

02:37:36.647 --> 02:37:38.415
DEBRIS AND SO THEY ARE NOT BY

02:37:38.482 --> 02:37:40.584
DEFINITION THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

02:37:40.651 --> 02:37:42.853
CAPTURE MICROPLASTICS. SO LET'S

02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:44.221
MOVE ON TO FILTRATION TYPE

02:37:44.288 --> 02:37:47.691
BMPS. YOU HEARD A COUPLE OF OUR

02:37:47.758 --> 02:37:50.294
PANEL MEMBERS TALK ABOUT RAIN

02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:50.794
GARDENS AND BY RETENTION

02:37:50.861 --> 02:37:53.263
SYSTEMS. THESE ARE TWO TYPES OF

02:37:53.330 --> 02:37:55.365
FILTRATION TYPE BMPS WHOSE

02:37:55.432 --> 02:37:58.235
OBJECTIVE IS TO CAPTURE RUNOFF

02:37:58.302 --> 02:38:00.838
FROM SAY A PARKING LOT OR MAYBE

02:38:00.904 --> 02:38:03.440
AS MUCH LAND AREA AS A CITY

02:38:03.507 --> 02:38:05.742
BLOCK. AND IT THAT MIGHT HAVE

02:38:05.809 --> 02:38:08.178
COME INTO- WHAT LOOKS LIKE WHAT

02:38:08.245 --> 02:38:09.413
LOOKS LIKE A GARDEN ON THE

02:38:09.479 --> 02:38:11.915
SURFACE. I AND THEN IT FILTERS

02:38:11.982 --> 02:38:14.618
VERTICALLY THROUGH A MEDIA AT

02:38:14.685 --> 02:38:16.453
THE SOIL LIKE MEDIA BUT IT'S

02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:20.724
BEEN ENGINEERED TO TRAP VARIOUS

02:38:20.791 --> 02:38:23.493
TYPES OF POLLUTANTS. DON'T SAY-

02:38:23.560 --> 02:38:25.529
WE'RE LUCKY ON THIS THAT DOCTOR

02:38:25.596 --> 02:38:28.665
SUTTON- ACT HAS OUR TO

02:38:28.732 --> 02:38:29.333
RESEARCHER THAT HAVE BEEN

02:38:29.399 --> 02:38:30.968
INVOLVED THE ONLY STUDIES THAT

02:38:31.034 --> 02:38:32.669
EXIST THAT SAY YES THERE'S

02:38:32.736 --> 02:38:34.104
PROMISE FOR THIS TYPE OF

02:38:34.171 --> 02:38:35.505
TECHNOLOGY FOR REMOVING

02:38:35.572 --> 02:38:37.741
MICROPLASTICS. THE PROBLEM IS

02:38:37.808 --> 02:38:40.043
THAT THESE ARE SMALL SCALE BMPS

02:38:40.110 --> 02:38:41.812
THEY TREAT RUNOFF FROM A VERY

02:38:41.879 --> 02:38:45.449
LIMITED LAND AREA. SO TO HAVE

02:38:45.515 --> 02:38:46.984
THAT IN IMPACT ON A ON A

02:38:47.050 --> 02:38:49.453
STATEWIDE BASIS IS VERY

02:38:49.519 --> 02:38:51.288
CHALLENGING. WE TAKE HAVE

02:38:51.355 --> 02:38:53.323
REGION SCALE BNP'S. SO THESE

02:38:53.390 --> 02:38:56.827
ARE BMPS THAT MANAGE RUNOFF OR

02:38:56.894 --> 02:38:57.995
ACCEPT RUNOFF FROM SAKE A

02:38:58.061 --> 02:39:00.631
COUPLE OF HUNDRED ACRES MAYBE.

02:39:00.697 --> 02:39:03.333
OF LAND AREA- BUT THERE'S

02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:05.435
REALLY NO MECHANISM WITH IN

02:39:05.502 --> 02:39:08.305
THESE TYPES OF BMPS TO REMOVE

02:39:08.372 --> 02:39:10.173
POLLUTANTS. I SAID THESE TYPES

02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:13.243
OF BMPS IS TO TAKE RUNOFF AND

02:39:13.310 --> 02:39:14.478
SOAK INTO THE GROUND EITHER

02:39:14.544 --> 02:39:16.480
BMPS WE BUILD FOR GROUNDWATER

02:39:16.546 --> 02:39:18.048
RECHARGE AND WHAT STORMWATER

02:39:18.115 --> 02:39:20.050
HARVESTING FOR TO THE

02:39:20.117 --> 02:39:21.919
SUPPLEMENT POTABLE USES POTABLE

02:39:21.985 --> 02:39:23.887
AND NON POTABLE USES. THE

02:39:23.954 --> 02:39:25.989
PROBLEM IS THAT WERE THE

02:39:26.056 --> 02:39:27.491
POTENTIAL PROBLEM IS THAT AS

02:39:27.557 --> 02:39:29.126
WATER SOAKS INTO THE GROUND IT

02:39:29.192 --> 02:39:31.561
MAY BRING THOSE MICROPLASTICS

02:39:31.628 --> 02:39:33.430
WITH IT IT MAY MIGRATE THROUGH.

02:39:33.497 --> 02:39:35.432
WE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW BECAUSE

02:39:35.499 --> 02:39:38.135
IT'S NEVER BEEN STUDIED. SO THE

02:39:38.201 --> 02:39:40.103
BOTTOM LINE IS WHAT WE HAVE I

02:39:40.170 --> 02:39:42.039
THINK IS A CHALLENGE OF SCALE

02:39:42.105 --> 02:39:43.974
WHEN IT COMES TO BMPS AND THEIR

02:39:44.041 --> 02:39:45.208
POTENTIAL TO MANAGE

02:39:45.275 --> 02:39:48.078
MICROPLASTICS. THEY'RE NOT

02:39:48.145 --> 02:39:49.813
MICROPLASTICS ARE NOT. CAPTURED

02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:51.281
BY EXISTING TRASH CAPTURE

02:39:51.348 --> 02:39:54.518
SYSTEMS WE HAVE SOME BMPS THAT

02:39:54.584 --> 02:39:55.519
SHOW PROMISE FOR MANAGING

02:39:55.585 --> 02:39:57.688
MICROPLASTICS BUT IT'S ONLY A

02:39:57.754 --> 02:39:59.756
LOCAL SCALE. MOST B. M. P.

02:39:59.823 --> 02:40:01.491
INFRASTRUCTURE WILL NOT SCALE

02:40:01.558 --> 02:40:03.593
SUFFICIENTLY- TO SOLVE THE

02:40:03.660 --> 02:40:04.828
PROBLEM WITH THE CURRENT

02:40:04.895 --> 02:40:06.363
PROGRAMS AND POLICIES THAT

02:40:06.430 --> 02:40:08.298
DRIVE THAT THAT CAUSE US TO

02:40:08.365 --> 02:40:12.102
BUILD BMPS- AND SO THAT'S- WHAT

02:40:12.169 --> 02:40:13.470
I HAD TO SHARE WITH YOU THANK

02:40:13.537 --> 02:40:16.173
YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. VERY

02:40:16.239 --> 02:40:19.076
MUCH WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR

02:40:19.142 --> 02:40:21.211
TAKING THE TIME. TO BE WITH US

02:40:21.278 --> 02:40:25.816
TODAY- DR- FASTENING BACK. ARM

02:40:25.882 --> 02:40:28.352
AND NOW I'D LIKE TO INVITE TO

02:40:28.418 --> 02:40:31.521
INVITE DR ALEXIS JACKSON. FROM

02:40:31.588 --> 02:40:33.357
THE NATURE CONSERVANCY TO TALK

02:40:33.423 --> 02:40:34.624
ABOUT EXPLORING NEAR TERM

02:40:34.691 --> 02:40:36.927
SOLUTIONS TO REDUCE THE

02:40:36.994 --> 02:40:39.763
PRESENCE OF PRACTICE PLASTIC

02:40:39.830 --> 02:40:42.132
PARTICLES ON FARMLANDS. AND

02:40:42.199 --> 02:40:44.201
LIMIT REENTRY TO WATERWAYS AND

02:40:44.267 --> 02:40:46.937
OCEAN OF COURSE WE'VE SEEN A

02:40:47.004 --> 02:40:47.804
COUPLE OF WAYS. FOR OUR

02:40:47.871 --> 02:40:49.606
PRESENTATIONS ON HOW THE

02:40:49.673 --> 02:40:51.708
PLASTIC PARTICLES CAN END UP ON

02:40:51.775 --> 02:40:55.312
FARMLAND FROM- THE DEPOSITION

02:40:55.379 --> 02:40:58.148
FROM THE AIR AS WELL AS

02:40:58.215 --> 02:41:01.284
PRESUMABLY FROM- SEWER SLUDGE

02:41:01.351 --> 02:41:03.520
SO DOCTOR JACKSON- PLEASE GO

02:41:03.587 --> 02:41:10.027
AHEAD. THANKS AND THANK YOU FOR

02:41:10.093 --> 02:41:11.161
THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT

02:41:11.228 --> 02:41:12.996
TODAY I'M TODAY I'M GONNA BE

02:41:13.063 --> 02:41:14.264
HIGHLIGHTING SOME FINDINGS FROM

02:41:14.331 --> 02:41:16.400
A STUDY THAT WOULD BE MORE IN

02:41:16.466 --> 02:41:18.468
COLLABORATION WITH RESEARCHERS

02:41:18.535 --> 02:41:20.137
AT UC SANTA BARBARA

02:41:20.203 --> 02:41:23.106
MICRODELETION CALIFORNIA ALSO

02:41:23.173 --> 02:41:29.613
OUR VALUE ENGINEERING ON. AND

02:41:29.679 --> 02:41:46.396
THIS IS WORK ON. MY MOTHER OKAY

02:41:46.463 --> 02:42:06.083
WHAT IS. THANK. JUST GO- IS

02:42:06.149 --> 02:42:09.653
THERE ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT. ALL

02:42:09.719 --> 02:42:15.058
IMPROPER OKAY TRY. HI JUSTIN

02:42:15.125 --> 02:42:22.165
SOMETHING AND THEN TRY AGAIN.

02:42:22.232 --> 02:42:26.803
NOT SURE WHAT TO. BE USED ON.

02:42:26.870 --> 02:42:30.707
OKAY. SORRY ABOUT THAT

02:42:30.774 --> 02:42:31.975
INTERRUPTION SO WE'RE

02:42:32.042 --> 02:42:33.110
SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT THE

02:42:33.176 --> 02:42:34.878
SYNTHETIC FIBERS THANK IT

02:42:34.945 --> 02:42:36.313
SHATTERED FROM THE WASHINGTON

02:42:36.379 --> 02:42:38.281
AREA AND WEARING REALLY OUR

02:42:38.348 --> 02:42:40.684
FAVORITE KIND OF STRETCHING

02:42:40.750 --> 02:42:44.654
FOR. HIGHER AS WE GET ANY

02:42:44.721 --> 02:42:47.591
BIOLOGICAL AND- MICROPLASTICS

02:42:47.657 --> 02:42:50.494
THIS YOU MIGHT ARE. WE WANTED

02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:51.895
TO ACTUALLY WANT BY THE PHONE

02:42:51.962 --> 02:42:58.435
MAKER I HEARD AND HOW. OUR AND

02:42:58.502 --> 02:43:01.905
SO WE LOOKED AT THIS. TO

02:43:01.972 --> 02:43:05.175
EIGHTEEN I MODELED THE- I HEARD

02:43:05.242 --> 02:43:08.745
YOU NUMBER WE WASHING- WHEN

02:43:08.812 --> 02:43:12.149
THEY INTO ARE AGAINST AND THEN

02:43:12.215 --> 02:43:18.488
FALLING. AFTER THERE AND- IT

02:43:18.555 --> 02:43:21.424
OUT SLIDES I'M AND WHAT ABOUT

02:43:21.491 --> 02:43:24.361
THIS PLACE AND TO. ENVIRONMENT

02:43:24.427 --> 02:43:31.468
WHERE. AND SO WE DO WE BY AT.

02:43:31.535 --> 02:43:36.206
ONE OF. OUR OUR FRIENDS BE MORE

02:43:36.273 --> 02:43:38.375
IN TWENTY NINE AMONG THESE MANY

02:43:38.441 --> 02:43:43.013
EXPORT NEXT ON MY EYEBROWS-

02:43:43.079 --> 02:43:49.319
EQUAL OF THIRTEEN POINT. THREE

02:43:49.386 --> 02:43:50.687
AND WE ALSO THAT RECORD AN

02:43:50.754 --> 02:43:59.362
INCREASE IN AND AS LOOK BLACK I.

02:43:59.429 --> 02:44:03.333
RATIONALLY SHIFTING THE BURDEN.

02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:06.436
JUDGE FROM THOSE ALRIGHT

02:44:06.503 --> 02:44:12.776
RESERVED. TO AND SO ACCORDING

02:44:12.842 --> 02:44:19.449
TO THE FIBERS ARE ANY BRAND. IN

02:44:19.516 --> 02:44:23.787
PART. AND SO WHAT FINDINGS ARE

02:44:23.853 --> 02:44:25.255
REALLY TOUGH US THIS WE HAVE A

02:44:25.322 --> 02:44:26.156
GROWING PROBLEM WITH MICHAEL

02:44:26.223 --> 02:44:29.993
YOUR HOW AND THAT THIS IS ISSUE

02:44:30.060 --> 02:44:36.132
NOT JUST. THIS WOULD BE A LOT

02:44:36.199 --> 02:44:38.835
OF PEOPLE. IT'S NOT THAT

02:44:38.902 --> 02:44:43.440
ACTUALLY I THINK START TALKING

02:44:43.506 --> 02:44:45.308
BLUES ESPECIALLY THOSE NEEDS OF

02:44:45.375 --> 02:44:52.349
OUR THAT WE KNOW OFF. BRAND.

02:44:52.415 --> 02:44:53.950
THE PRESENCE OF MICROFIBERS

02:44:54.017 --> 02:44:56.386
HAVE THE SAME IMPACT ON SOIL AS

02:44:56.453 --> 02:44:58.221
DROUGHT CONDITIONS IMPACTED

02:44:58.288 --> 02:45:01.424
PRODUCTION DRAMA SOMETHING WE

02:45:01.491 --> 02:45:05.195
ALL. RIGHT AND ARE CONCERNED

02:45:05.262 --> 02:45:06.429
ABOUT. WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT

02:45:06.496 --> 02:45:12.369
THESE MAKE A FIVE AND MAX. I SO

02:45:12.435 --> 02:45:20.443
OR THAT ALSO IMPACTING- RIVALS.

02:45:20.510 --> 02:45:21.278
AND THEN THE LAST PART OF THAT

02:45:21.344 --> 02:45:27.250
WE KNOW THAT PLASTICS. BROWN

02:45:27.317 --> 02:45:30.620
BEGAN AS OF THE WOODS ARE THAT

02:45:30.687 --> 02:45:34.858
WORKING- AND THAT THEY CREATE.

02:45:34.924 --> 02:45:39.829
FOR PERSONAL STOCK. AND SO WHAT

02:45:39.896 --> 02:45:41.931
WE DO IN LIFE AND THESE KIND OF

02:45:41.998 --> 02:45:44.100
FINDING WHAT THE NEW YEAR HOME

02:45:44.167 --> 02:45:48.872
OR. I'M SO ONE OF THE THINGS

02:45:48.938 --> 02:45:56.246
WAS MEANT TO IS THAT. FIVE EVEN

02:45:56.313 --> 02:45:58.214
THINK ABOUT DO WE DESIGN.

02:45:58.281 --> 02:46:00.717
STYLES THEY SHOULD LAST THOSE

02:46:00.784 --> 02:46:01.951
ARE THINGS THAT YOU DO

02:46:02.018 --> 02:46:07.424
BRITAIN'S. NOT MAYBE LONG. LIKE

02:46:07.490 --> 02:46:13.563
MOST. THERE WERE POLICING THAT

02:46:13.630 --> 02:46:17.300
WAS AND ALSO HOW BETTER CITING.

02:46:17.367 --> 02:46:19.969
AND SO WITH RESPECT TO BUILT UP

02:46:20.036 --> 02:46:21.638
ALL OF THE ACTION YOU KNOW THE

02:46:21.705 --> 02:46:26.943
BIG BANKS YES. YEAH THIS YEAR

02:46:27.010 --> 02:46:31.614
WE BILLS IN- ASSEMBLYMEMBER IS

02:46:31.681 --> 02:46:35.919
THE NUMBER. AGAIN TO THIS MY

02:46:35.985 --> 02:46:40.490
ACT. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DID

02:46:40.557 --> 02:46:42.659
IN OUR IS THAT WE WANT TO MODEL

02:46:42.726 --> 02:46:48.865
THE- ACCESS. ALL THANK YOU BE

02:46:48.932 --> 02:46:51.201
STRUCTURED IN A NUMBER. I'M AND

02:46:51.267 --> 02:46:52.402
SO THIS IS JUST A LABOR OF SOME

02:46:52.469 --> 02:46:55.438
OF THIS. LOOKING AT THE STUDY

02:46:55.505 --> 02:46:57.040
SO SOME OF THEM ARE AT WHAT

02:46:57.107 --> 02:47:00.143
WHAT IT LOOK LIKE IT HOW IS IT

02:47:00.210 --> 02:47:04.147
SOME KIND OF ALTERCATION BACK.

02:47:04.214 --> 02:47:06.049
IN WASHINGTON. AND WITH THE

02:47:06.116 --> 02:47:07.617
PROBLEM WITH YOUR- WEATHER

02:47:07.684 --> 02:47:13.757
THERE THAT LINE. AFTER HIS AND

02:47:13.823 --> 02:47:16.259
EARLIER SOME POLICIES LOOK AT

02:47:16.326 --> 02:47:18.762
WHAT WE LOOK LIKE TO TRAIN FROM

02:47:18.828 --> 02:47:21.297
A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE. GEN CHIU

02:47:21.364 --> 02:47:25.135
HIGHER LEVEL I'M THERE ISSUES

02:47:25.201 --> 02:47:29.005
SO SHE WOULD ALL GUNS INTER IN

02:47:29.072 --> 02:47:39.582
ONE GET OUT. THIS IS JUST SOME

02:47:39.649 --> 02:47:42.185
OF THE HIGH LEVEL FINDINGS-

02:47:42.252 --> 02:47:43.386
THANK YOU MATTER THE SCENARIO

02:47:43.453 --> 02:47:45.021
MODELING AND WE WERE LOOKING AT

02:47:45.088 --> 02:47:46.022
WHAT DO THESE POLICY

02:47:46.089 --> 02:47:48.558
INTERVENTIONS. TO MICROFIBER

02:47:48.625 --> 02:47:50.660
EMISSIONS ONLINE ALSO LOOK AT

02:47:50.727 --> 02:47:54.464
THIS WATER THIS MORNING SOME

02:47:54.531 --> 02:47:55.031
MINUTES I AM RESPOND. SO THE

02:47:55.098 --> 02:47:57.434
FIRST AWAY ARE YOU NOT ALLOWED

02:47:57.500 --> 02:47:59.002
OF THESE ARE REALLY VERY SENSE

02:47:59.068 --> 02:48:00.403
IS THAT THIS SOONER INTERNET.

02:48:00.470 --> 02:48:03.006
START MORE EFFECTIVE OR EFFORTS

02:48:03.072 --> 02:48:05.909
ARE TO REDUCE MY PRIVATE. AND

02:48:05.975 --> 02:48:11.214
SO WE SEE THAT IN AREAS. WHERE.

02:48:11.281 --> 02:48:15.819
ONE AND- HUNDRED SPEED. IS THAT

02:48:15.885 --> 02:48:17.153
WILL TREAT NON YOU CAN BE A

02:48:17.220 --> 02:48:18.888
PART OF SOLUTION I'M WE SEE

02:48:18.955 --> 02:48:21.458
THAT THOSE ARE HIGHLY WE'RE

02:48:21.524 --> 02:48:23.159
SEEING AND I DECLINE IN NUMBER

02:48:23.226 --> 02:48:28.231
MY THERE. THOSE ARE COMING FROM

02:48:28.298 --> 02:48:33.403
THE- IN LINE- OR WASHER. AND

02:48:33.470 --> 02:48:35.338
THIS IS LOCAL THAT LINE IS FROM

02:48:35.405 --> 02:48:38.975
OF. HOW QUICKLY. I'M WE'RE

02:48:39.042 --> 02:48:40.043
THOSE SOLUTIONS AFTER

02:48:40.109 --> 02:48:42.111
CALIFORNIA AND THE PERCENTAGE

02:48:42.178 --> 02:48:44.981
RIGHT SO. I'M SOLUTIONS ARE PUT

02:48:45.048 --> 02:48:46.950
OUT FOR A 100% OF CALIFORNIANS

02:48:47.016 --> 02:48:49.219
YOU SEE A SHARPER MIND NUMBER

02:48:49.285 --> 02:48:50.320
MY NUMBERS THAT ARE ENTERING

02:48:50.386 --> 02:48:52.355
LANDS FIRST IS WHEN IT'S ONLY

02:48:52.422 --> 02:48:54.557
IN THE BANK STATE. AND THEN THE

02:48:54.624 --> 02:48:55.592
THIRD ONE THAT I THINK IT'S

02:48:55.658 --> 02:48:56.426
ACTUALLY REALLY INTERESTING IS

02:48:56.493 --> 02:49:00.029
THE FACT THAT. THERE'S A LOT OF

02:49:00.096 --> 02:49:00.530
ASSUMPTIONS AROUND WHAT

02:49:00.597 --> 02:49:02.065
INVESTMENTS BETTER WASTEWATER

02:49:02.131 --> 02:49:06.369
TREATMENT PLANT INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:49:06.436 --> 02:49:08.204
ENGINE THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT

02:49:08.271 --> 02:49:11.241
IF ARBITRATION ADDITION BETTER

02:49:11.307 --> 02:49:14.177
THIS WILL HELP US ALL. WE

02:49:14.244 --> 02:49:17.113
ACTUALLY SEEMS AREAS SIX DID

02:49:17.180 --> 02:49:23.453
THIS IS THAT SEEN IN. IN MY.

02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:24.754
WHY IS THAT THAT'S BECAUSE THE

02:49:24.821 --> 02:49:27.590
AFTER IS THAT USE BROWN'S LINE

02:49:27.657 --> 02:49:30.994
BY A SOLID. IT IS ACTUALLY JUST

02:49:31.060 --> 02:49:35.498
READ EQUAL OR MORE. AFTER WE

02:49:35.565 --> 02:49:38.034
ABOUT SIMPSON'S IN ORDER TO

02:49:38.101 --> 02:49:42.572
REALLY GENERAL. AND SO. IN

02:49:42.639 --> 02:49:45.875
WANTED TO TAKE A FROM. S. ASKED

02:49:45.942 --> 02:49:47.043
WHICH IS DON'T YOU HAVE A

02:49:47.110 --> 02:49:49.412
GROWING MY- PROBLEM. HERE AND

02:49:49.479 --> 02:49:50.914
HOW IT'S NOT THAT'S JUST OUT OF

02:49:50.980 --> 02:49:56.052
HEALTH OUTSIDE OF. RIGHT VOTE

COASTAL AND INLAND. LAST

02:49:58.655 --> 02:49:59.889
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT THE

02:49:59.956 --> 02:50:04.027
FIRES ARE READ. THE APPLYING A

02:50:04.093 --> 02:50:10.133
BIOS ALL NINE ALLAFRICA IS. AND

I TO INVITE DOCTOR K. O'NEILL

02:50:33.256 --> 02:50:33.690
WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF.

02:50:33.756 --> 02:50:34.557
BERKELEY TO TALK ABOUT WHY IN

02:50:34.624 --> 02:50:35.658
HIGH. WE NEED TO ADDRESS

02:50:35.725 --> 02:50:37.126
BEHAVIOR AS IT RELATES TO

02:50:37.193 --> 02:50:40.697
PLASTIC USE AND PASSED PLASTIC

02:50:40.763 --> 02:50:46.035
WASTE GENERATION. OKAY HEY

02:50:46.102 --> 02:50:49.105
THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR THANK

THE PRESENTATION SO FAR AND I'M

02:50:55.378 --> 02:50:58.014
UNDERSTANDING AND LOOKING AT

02:50:58.081 --> 02:50:59.882
THE VIEW YES LET CHAU. SUS

02:50:59.949 --> 02:51:04.554
RIGHT- AND YEAH JUST TRYING TO

02:51:04.621 --> 02:51:10.927
GET AT THE. SORRY I WILL SO

02:51:10.994 --> 02:51:12.662
THANK EVERYBODY AGAIN FOR

02:51:12.729 --> 02:51:13.863
AMAZING PRESENTATIONS I'VE

02:51:13.930 --> 02:51:16.132
LEARNED SO MUCH IN THE COURSE

02:51:16.199 --> 02:51:17.100
OF THE AFTERNOON BECAUSE MOST

02:51:17.166 --> 02:51:18.401
OF MY WORK IS ABOUT WHAT YOU

02:51:18.468 --> 02:51:19.702
MIGHT CALL MATTER PLASTICS BUT

02:51:19.769 --> 02:51:22.138
IT'S INTERESTING TO CAN THINK

02:51:22.205 --> 02:51:23.506
ABOUT HOW TO APPLY SOME OF

02:51:23.573 --> 02:51:24.774
THOSE IDEAS AND IDEAS I'VE

02:51:24.841 --> 02:51:26.509
HEARD TO THINKING CONNECTING

02:51:26.576 --> 02:51:28.578
WITH CONSUMER BEHAVIOR I JUST

02:51:28.645 --> 02:51:30.580
BRIEFLY- I AM A PROFESSOR AT UC

02:51:30.647 --> 02:51:31.748
BERKELEY I WALK ON THE GLOBAL

02:51:31.814 --> 02:51:34.017
POLITICS MOSTLY OF WASTE AND

02:51:34.083 --> 02:51:37.286
PLASTICS- BUT INCREASINGLY I'M

02:51:37.353 --> 02:51:39.822
DRAWN INTO THE LOCAL- POLITICS

02:51:39.889 --> 02:51:41.491
OF PLASTICS ZERO WASTE THE

02:51:41.557 --> 02:51:43.059
BUCKLEY LEVEL AND BEYOND

02:51:43.126 --> 02:51:45.294
BECAUSE SIMPLY WHAT HAPPENS AT

02:51:45.361 --> 02:51:46.996
THE LOCAL LEVEL IN THIS. ARENA

02:51:47.063 --> 02:51:49.265
SO CLEARLY AFFECTS THE STATE

02:51:49.332 --> 02:51:54.637
AND THE HEALTH OF OUR PLANET.

02:51:54.704 --> 02:51:57.106
SO- SO MY- AND CONSUMER

02:51:57.173 --> 02:51:59.175
BEHAVIOR AND I'LL JUST KIND OF

02:51:59.242 --> 02:51:59.742
GIVE YOU THAT THE FUNDING I

02:51:59.809 --> 02:52:02.478
HAVE NOW IS THAT- ITS CONSUMER

02:52:02.545 --> 02:52:04.380
BEHAVIOR IS IMPORTANT BUT IT IS

02:52:04.447 --> 02:52:06.082
AND IT'S A NECESSARY PROTECT

02:52:06.149 --> 02:52:07.417
HEART OF THE SOLUTION BUT IT IS

02:52:07.483 --> 02:52:10.586
BY NO MEANS. SUFFICIENT AND IN

02:52:10.653 --> 02:52:14.023
FACT ALL THE- LINES OF INQUIRY

02:52:14.090 --> 02:52:15.825
LINES OF A POLICY MIGHT

02:52:15.892 --> 02:52:17.627
ACTUALLY BE EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE

02:52:17.694 --> 02:52:19.429
BUT- FOR MANY FOLKS

02:52:19.495 --> 02:52:20.963
MICROPLASTICS AND NOT THE

02:52:21.030 --> 02:52:22.532
MAINFRAME. OF THE GLOBAL

02:52:22.598 --> 02:52:24.400
PLASTICS PROBLEM A LOT OF

02:52:24.467 --> 02:52:25.668
STUDIES POINT OUT THAT WHEN

02:52:25.735 --> 02:52:27.136
THEY TALK TO PEOPLE THE FIRST

02:52:27.203 --> 02:52:28.438
THING THEY THINK ABOUT A MACRO

02:52:28.504 --> 02:52:29.872
PLASTICS IN THE OCEAN HAT

02:52:29.939 --> 02:52:31.708
MICROPLASTICS ARE. KIND OF

02:52:31.774 --> 02:52:33.509
COMPLICATED A DEPENDS ON HOW

02:52:33.576 --> 02:52:34.544
THEY'RE FRAMED BUT PUBLIC

02:52:34.610 --> 02:52:36.179
AWARENESS TENDS TO BE FAIRLY

02:52:36.245 --> 02:52:38.147
LOW AND THIS SUGGESTS THAT

02:52:38.214 --> 02:52:40.016
CHANGING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR ON

02:52:40.083 --> 02:52:42.151
THESE GROUNDS IT IS QUITE HARD.

02:52:42.218 --> 02:52:43.152
BUT I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT

02:52:43.219 --> 02:52:44.520
ABOUT MAYBE WE HOW WE MANAGE

02:52:44.587 --> 02:52:46.222
THAT AND SOME OF THE

02:52:46.289 --> 02:52:48.758
APPLICATIONS. OF MICROPLASTICS

02:52:48.825 --> 02:52:50.293
AND ZERO WASTE EUROPE PLASTICS

02:52:50.359 --> 02:52:52.895
POLICIES TO- THIS PARTICULAR

02:52:52.962 --> 02:52:54.864
PROBLEM AND I WANT TO NOTE TO

02:52:54.931 --> 02:52:57.467
THE OUTSET THAT. MICROPLASTICS

02:52:57.533 --> 02:52:58.935
OF THE CONTRIBUTION THAT WE AS

02:52:59.001 --> 02:53:00.603
WEALTHY COUNTRIES MAKE TO OCEAN

02:53:00.670 --> 02:53:02.905
PLASTICS POLLUTION. ALL WHILE A

02:53:02.972 --> 02:53:04.874
LOT OF THE COASTAL ALL FLOW IS

02:53:04.941 --> 02:53:07.376
FROM- DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS

02:53:07.443 --> 02:53:09.011
PROFESSOR LAWS PRESENTATION

02:53:09.078 --> 02:53:11.447
SHOWED- MORE MICROPLASTICS

02:53:11.514 --> 02:53:13.483
ACTUALLY COME FROM THE COAST OF

02:53:13.549 --> 02:53:14.684
THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER

02:53:14.751 --> 02:53:16.085
WEALTHY COUNTRIES SO THAT GIVES

02:53:16.152 --> 02:53:20.456
US EVEN MORE RESPONSIBILITY. TO

02:53:20.523 --> 02:53:21.090
BE THINKING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.

02:53:21.157 --> 02:53:22.725
SO EXISTING CONSUMER TIME TO SO.

02:53:22.792 --> 02:53:24.660
THAT THEY'RE AWESOME- WE'VE

02:53:24.727 --> 02:53:25.495
ALREADY SOMEONE'S ALREADY

02:53:25.561 --> 02:53:27.296
MENTIONED THE LOWEST IN THE US

02:53:27.363 --> 02:53:28.998
AND IN EUROPE ON'T RINSE OFF

02:53:29.065 --> 02:53:31.567
MICROBEADS IN PERSONAL CARE

02:53:31.634 --> 02:53:32.869
PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN IN

02:53:32.935 --> 02:53:35.905
PLACE SINCE- TWENTY SEVENTEEN

02:53:35.972 --> 02:53:36.873
NATIONALLY AND EARLIER OF

02:53:36.939 --> 02:53:38.775
COURSE IN CALIFORNIA. ARE

02:53:38.841 --> 02:53:41.344
AWARENESS I DEFINITELY ON THE

02:53:41.410 --> 02:53:43.613
ON THE UP A WITH MEDIA REPORTS

02:53:43.679 --> 02:53:47.116
ABOUT MICROPLASTICS ABOUT-

02:53:47.183 --> 02:53:49.051
BASICALLY ABOUT THE PREVALENCE

02:53:49.118 --> 02:53:50.019
NOW OF PLASTIC IN THE

02:53:50.086 --> 02:53:51.988
APPEARANCE OF PLASTICS IN HUMAN

02:53:52.054 --> 02:53:54.857
BODIES. IN BLOOD. ALL THE WAY

02:53:54.924 --> 02:53:56.159
UP THE FOOD CHAIN THAT IS

02:53:56.225 --> 02:53:57.393
CERTAINLY A RAISE A LOT OF

02:53:57.460 --> 02:53:59.295
AWARENESS NGOS ARE VERY MUCH

02:53:59.362 --> 02:54:01.397
MOBILIZED AROUND THIS AND AS WE

02:54:01.464 --> 02:54:02.498
CAN TELL FROM TODAY THE SO

02:54:02.565 --> 02:54:04.667
MUCH. SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND I

02:54:04.734 --> 02:54:05.735
THINK HEALTH CONCERNS HAVE

02:54:05.802 --> 02:54:07.370
REALLY BEEN THE DRIVER. THE

02:54:07.436 --> 02:54:09.071
MAIN DRIVER WHEN IT COMES TO

02:54:09.138 --> 02:54:11.808
SPECIFIC ACTION AROUND MICRO

02:54:11.874 --> 02:54:15.144
PLASTICS- WE HAVE DEVICES THAT

02:54:15.211 --> 02:54:16.546
WASH AND DRY FILTERS THAT

02:54:16.612 --> 02:54:18.247
DOCTOR JACKSON TALKED ABOUT

02:54:18.314 --> 02:54:19.515
THAT'S- A BIT MORE MY NEXT

02:54:19.582 --> 02:54:21.951
SLIDE. HOWEVER A TIRE FRAGMENTS

02:54:22.018 --> 02:54:23.953
AND OTHER SOURCES OF MICRO.

02:54:24.020 --> 02:54:25.755
PLASTICS A MUCH MORE DIFFICULT

02:54:25.822 --> 02:54:26.756
TO ADDRESS FROM A CONSUMER

02:54:26.823 --> 02:54:28.991
BEHAVIOR PERSPECTIVE ON RECALL

02:54:29.058 --> 02:54:31.127
FOR MORE HOLISTIC. APPROACH

02:54:31.194 --> 02:54:35.665
THAT ALSO. FOCUSES ON SOURCE

02:54:35.731 --> 02:54:36.933
REDUCTION. OTHERWISE THE DR

02:54:36.999 --> 02:54:38.868
PHIL TO A I'M REALLY- TO.

02:54:38.935 --> 02:54:40.136
FOLLOWING UP ON EARLIER

02:54:40.203 --> 02:54:42.405
PRESENTATIONS HERE BUT I WAS

02:54:42.471 --> 02:54:43.673
LOOKING AT THIS RECENT STUDY

02:54:43.739 --> 02:54:45.508
THAT STUDY THAT LOOKED AT IN

02:54:45.575 --> 02:54:47.376
GRAHAM DEVICES BUSES EXTERNAL

02:54:47.443 --> 02:54:50.479
FILTERS FOUND THEM TO BE. QUITE

02:54:50.546 --> 02:54:52.548
EFFECTIVE AND ALSO AFFORDABLE I

02:54:52.615 --> 02:54:53.683
FEEL LIKE I'M DOING A LITTLE AD

02:54:53.749 --> 02:54:55.551
HE IF A GUPPY FRIEND AND KORABL

02:54:55.618 --> 02:54:58.788
BUT- THERE YOU GO THE- IDEA OF

02:54:58.855 --> 02:55:00.022
THEM ONE OF THESE THESE

02:55:00.089 --> 02:55:01.490
CONSUMERS CHANGES IS TO

02:55:01.557 --> 02:55:04.460
ENCOURAGE. US TO ACQUIRE

02:55:04.527 --> 02:55:07.530
FILTERS OR IN IN- IN LAUNDRY

02:55:07.597 --> 02:55:10.399
DEVICES TO REMOVE- MICROPHONE

02:55:10.466 --> 02:55:12.001
OF MICROFIBRES FROM UP CLOSE

02:55:12.068 --> 02:55:14.270
BEFORE THEY ENTER- THE WATER

02:55:14.337 --> 02:55:17.840
SUPPLY. AND AS I WAS-

02:55:17.907 --> 02:55:18.908
RESEARCHING THIS AND THINKING

02:55:18.975 --> 02:55:20.243
ABOUT IT I THOUGHT WELL MAYBE

02:55:20.309 --> 02:55:22.612
IN A ONE INTERVENTION COULD BE

02:55:22.678 --> 02:55:24.380
SOME KIND OF ENERGY STAR

02:55:24.447 --> 02:55:26.148
EQUIVALENT FOR. LOTS OF PLANTS

02:55:26.215 --> 02:55:29.318
AS IF. THAT HAVE FILTERS HAVE

02:55:29.385 --> 02:55:30.887
THE MECHANISMS IN THEM TO

02:55:30.953 --> 02:55:32.555
REDUCE THE ENTRY OF FIBRES INTO

02:55:32.622 --> 02:55:34.123
THE ENVIRONMENT ENERGY STAR HAS

02:55:34.190 --> 02:55:38.728
BEEN A VERY POPULAR. PROGRAM

02:55:38.794 --> 02:55:40.263
AMONG CONSUMERS. BUT THEN I TO

02:55:40.329 --> 02:55:41.564
WILL WELCOME THINK LEARN FROM

02:55:41.631 --> 02:55:44.600
MACRO- TO USE THAT THE CAN.

02:55:44.667 --> 02:55:46.435
TOPLESS IS REALLY MORE MY FIELD

02:55:46.502 --> 02:55:48.604
OF STUDY. AND NOTED LEE HOW CAN

02:55:48.671 --> 02:55:50.439
WE CONNECT THIS TO OF ALL THE

02:55:50.506 --> 02:55:51.707
ZERO WASTE EFFORTS BAG BANS

02:55:51.774 --> 02:55:53.476
SINGLE USE FOOD WELL ORDINANCES

02:55:53.542 --> 02:55:54.710
THAT HAVE BECOME PART OF OUR

02:55:54.777 --> 02:55:56.579
LIVES. AND THIS IN TURN TO

02:55:56.646 --> 02:55:58.547
PROTECT- PREVENT MICROPLASTICS

02:55:58.614 --> 02:56:00.116
TO THE EMISSION OF SECONDARY

02:56:00.182 --> 02:56:02.418
MICROPLASTICS THE GOOD NEWS ON

02:56:02.485 --> 02:56:04.453
ON THIS FRONT IS THAT GLOBAL

02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:06.289
POLLS SHOWED CHANGING NORMS

02:56:06.355 --> 02:56:08.457
ATTITUDES REGARDING. SINGLE USE

02:56:08.524 --> 02:56:10.426
PLASTICS AND THESE HAVE

02:56:10.493 --> 02:56:12.795
GENERATED LOCAL NATIONAL AND

02:56:12.862 --> 02:56:14.297
CROSS NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL

02:56:14.363 --> 02:56:16.332
REGULATIONS THE BAD NEWS S

02:56:16.399 --> 02:56:18.534
THAT. THESE MEASURES ARE BEING

02:56:18.601 --> 02:56:20.836
CHALLENGED- A COUPLE OF FRONTS

02:56:20.903 --> 02:56:23.105
BOTH BY PLASTICS INDUSTRY IN

02:56:23.172 --> 02:56:23.639
OTHER OPPOSITION BUT MOST

02:56:23.706 --> 02:56:25.908
IMMEDIATELY THE PANDEMIC IT

02:56:25.975 --> 02:56:27.043
COULD IS THREATENING TO

02:56:27.109 --> 02:56:29.578
UNDERMINE. CONSUMER LOANS AND

02:56:29.645 --> 02:56:34.317
SUPPORT AROUND REDUCING SINGLE.

02:56:34.383 --> 02:56:34.984
USE PLASTICS IN OUR DAILY LIVES.

02:56:35.051 --> 02:56:36.585
SO GIVING A CALL OF EXAMPLES OF

02:56:36.652 --> 02:56:38.788
CHANGING. SOCIAL NORMS IN THE

02:56:38.854 --> 02:56:42.692
U. K. YOU SEE- 55% OF

02:56:42.758 --> 02:56:43.993
RESPONDENTS SAYING THEY CHANGE

02:56:44.060 --> 02:56:45.528
THEIR FOOD PURCHASING HABITS

SIMILARLY A LITTLE HARD TO FIND

02:57:02.511 --> 02:57:04.380
THE DIRECT DATA ON PLASTICS

02:57:04.447 --> 02:57:05.982
THIS IS THIS IS- THE MOST

02:57:06.048 --> 02:57:08.317
RECENT AND RELEVANT ALL. DATA

02:57:08.384 --> 02:57:10.219
THAT I FOUND THAT TWO THIRDS OF

PAY MORE FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY

SHOWS THE- STATEWIDE. ACTIONS

02:57:28.204 --> 02:57:30.206

THERE- AND THE GREEN STATES

02:57:39.015 --> 02:57:41.150
THEIR UNFORTUNATE CHOICE OF

02:57:41.217 --> 02:57:44.186
COLOR I WOULD SAY FOR THIS- FOR

02:57:44.253 --> 02:57:46.055
THIS VISUALIZATION BUT THIS

02:57:46.122 --> 02:57:47.223
REPRESENTS SOME OF THE INDUSTRY

02:57:47.289 --> 02:57:48.557
PUSH BACK HE'S A STATE FROM

02:57:56.766 --> 02:57:58.200
WITHIN THE STATE OR THAT'S NOT

02:57:58.267 --> 02:58:02.171
SPENT A VERY AGGRESSIVE TURN AS

02:58:02.238 --> 02:58:02.738
THAT NUMBER HAS INCREASED IN

02:58:02.805 --> 02:58:03.339
PAST YEARS. AND THEN WE HAVE

02:58:03.406 --> 02:58:05.307
LOCAL SYSTEM GIVE A SHOUT OUT

02:58:05.374 --> 02:58:07.176

PLASTICS BY TWENTY THIRTY SO

02:58:27.930 --> 02:58:28.998
THESE MEASURES HAVE BEEN GREAT

02:58:29.065 --> 02:58:30.633
THEY'VE BEEN BACKED BY CHANGES

02:58:30.699 --> 02:58:32.968
IN PUBLIC OPINION. AND CHANGES

02:58:33.035 --> 02:58:34.904
IN IN CONSUMER BEHAVIOR HAPPEN

02:58:34.970 --> 02:58:36.639
NOTCHED A LONG BY THE

02:58:36.705 --> 02:58:40.443
AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVES.

02:58:40.509 --> 02:58:42.845
AND FEES AND SO ON. BUT RIGHT

02:58:42.912 --> 02:58:44.647
NOW I THINK WE'RE WE'RE IN

02:58:44.713 --> 02:58:48.117
CRISIS. SO MANY REASONS BUT OF

02:58:48.184 --> 02:58:50.686
THE MIND ABBAS IS DOING WORK ON

02:58:50.753 --> 02:58:52.254
ON THE IMPACT OF THE NINETEEN

02:58:52.321 --> 02:58:55.024
ON ZERO WASTE AND DISPOSABLE-

02:58:55.091 --> 02:58:56.125
GETTING RID OF DISPOSABLE

02:58:56.192 --> 02:58:57.726
SINGLE USE PLASTICS AND WE'RE

02:58:57.793 --> 02:59:01.530
FINDING THAT RIGHT NOW- THIS IS

02:59:01.597 --> 02:59:03.165
THIS. SINGLE USE PLASTICS ARE

02:59:03.232 --> 02:59:04.800
BECOMING A PROBLEM AGAIN WEBER

02:59:04.867 --> 02:59:06.469
BUT THE HOW MASKS THEMSELVES

02:59:06.535 --> 02:59:08.537
MAY BE A DIRECT SOURCE. OF

02:59:08.604 --> 02:59:10.306
MICROPLASTICS INTO OUR BODIES

02:59:10.372 --> 02:59:12.641
AS WE WENT THEM WELL CERTAINLY

02:59:12.708 --> 02:59:14.310
THAT GOING TO BE- A SOURCE OF

02:59:14.376 --> 02:59:18.280
MICROPLASTICS IN- WATERWAYS IN

02:59:18.347 --> 02:59:20.349
THE AIR AS AS THEY ARE DISPOSED

02:59:20.416 --> 02:59:22.218
OF AND- BUT THINKING ABOUT

02:59:22.284 --> 02:59:23.752
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR REALLY THIS

02:59:23.819 --> 02:59:25.087
IS. THIS IS THIS IS BEEN A

02:59:25.154 --> 02:59:26.655
MAJOR CHANGE WE DON'T ACTUALLY

02:59:26.722 --> 02:59:28.390
HAVE OPINION POLL DATA OR-

02:59:28.457 --> 02:59:30.126
CHANGING BEHAVE DATE DATA WE

02:59:30.192 --> 02:59:34.697
SEE RETAILERS AND. FOOD

02:59:34.763 --> 02:59:35.698
BUSINESSES- LIVING VERY QUICKLY

02:59:35.764 --> 02:59:38.534
TO BAMA. AND ALSO SAW WAS SEEN

02:59:38.601 --> 02:59:41.203
THE STALLING OF LEGISLATION

02:59:41.270 --> 02:59:43.572
FRANCISCO- REIMPOSING ITS BAG

02:59:43.639 --> 02:59:44.773
BAN I THINK THIS IS REALLY

02:59:44.840 --> 02:59:45.875
CRITICAL WHEN WE'RE TALKING

02:59:45.941 --> 02:59:47.676
ABOUT WHAT POLITICAL ACTION CAN

02:59:47.743 --> 02:59:50.412
BE TAKEN. TO REDUCE PLASTIC BAG

02:59:50.479 --> 02:59:53.115
TO- REDUCE MICROPLASTICS GOING

02:59:53.182 --> 02:59:54.617
INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. SO MY

02:59:54.683 --> 02:59:58.120
RECOMMENDATIONS- THIS IS JUST

02:59:58.187 --> 03:00:00.422
BRIEFLY FROM STUDIES THAT. WE

03:00:00.489 --> 03:00:04.160
NEED TO RAISE PUBLIC AWARENESS-

03:00:04.226 --> 03:00:05.661
ACTIONS NEED TO ENGAGE PEOPLE

03:00:05.728 --> 03:00:07.062
IN THEIR EVERYDAY RELATIONSHIP

03:00:07.129 --> 03:00:10.065
WITH PLASTICS THE STUDY- ON THE

03:00:10.132 --> 03:00:11.800
TOP THAT IT HIGHLIGHTS THAT

03:00:11.867 --> 03:00:14.570
pOF SWIMMERS WERE BY FAR AND

03:00:14.637 --> 03:00:16.639
AWAY THE MOST AWARE OF THE

03:00:16.705 --> 03:00:19.308
PROBLEM. AND THEN ALSO BUT IT

03:00:19.375 --> 03:00:21.277
ALSO MEANS TARGETING MANY TYPES

03:00:21.343 --> 03:00:22.811
OF MICROPLASTICS MIGHT MEAN

03:00:22.878 --> 03:00:25.714
WORKING OUTSIDE OF THE REALM OF

03:00:25.781 --> 03:00:27.550
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR. GOING BACK

03:00:27.616 --> 03:00:28.784
TO THIS NINETEEN EIGHTEEN DATA

03:00:28.851 --> 03:00:31.253
ON THE FROM THE U. K. HERE

03:00:31.320 --> 03:00:32.621
THERE ARE ASKED WHOSE PROBLEM

03:00:32.688 --> 03:00:34.790
IS IT AND YOU SEE CONSUMERS

03:00:34.857 --> 03:00:36.492
SAYING HEY YOU KNOW IT'S NOT

03:00:36.559 --> 03:00:39.061
OUR WHOSE IT IS IF ALL OF THE

03:00:39.128 --> 03:00:40.763
ABOVE BUT IT'S NOT JUST US.

03:00:40.829 --> 03:00:42.631
PLEASE TAKE ACTION AT OTHER

03:00:42.698 --> 03:00:44.433
LEVELS COMPANIES THAT PRODUCE

03:00:44.500 --> 03:00:46.101
PACKAGING THE COMPANY'S CELL

PACKAGING AND THE GOVERNMENT.

03:00:48.637 --> 03:00:50.206
SO I THINK THAT THAT'S A- AN

03:00:50.272 --> 03:00:51.874
OPINION THAT'S WORTH BEARING IN

03:00:51.941 --> 03:00:53.475
MIND AS AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO

03:00:53.542 --> 03:00:54.243
THINKING ABOUT DEALING WITH

03:00:54.310 --> 03:00:56.745
THIS PROBLEM. SO ULTIMATELY

03:00:56.812 --> 03:00:58.581
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR IS NECESSARY

03:00:58.647 --> 03:01:00.950
BUT BY NO MEANS CLOSE TO A

03:01:01.016 --> 03:01:01.450
SUFFICIENT PART OF THE

03:01:01.517 --> 03:01:05.254
SOLUTION. OBVIOUSLY WE NEED-

03:01:05.321 --> 03:01:07.289
THE STANDARD SUITE APPROACHES

EDUCATION AWARENESS

03:01:08.057 --> 03:01:09.658
TRANSPARENCY WHAT GOES INTO

03:11:38.587 --> 03:11:39.955
IN THE BACKGROUND MEMO FOR THAT

03:11:40.021 --> 03:11:41.523
HEARING. AS WE BELIEVE THAT

03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:43.458
SOURCE REDUCTION OF MACRO

03:11:43.525 --> 03:11:46.695
PLASTICS IS A HUGE PART OF. THE

03:11:46.761 --> 03:11:50.899
SOLUTION FOR- REDUCING

03:11:50.966 --> 03:11:52.367
MICROPLASTICS- MORE UPSTREAM

03:11:52.434 --> 03:12:00.642
RATHER THAN SOME OF. THE

03:12:00.709 --> 03:12:02.644
DOWNSTREAM POLLUTION. I WE ALSO-

03:12:02.711 --> 03:12:03.578
WE'RE GLAD TO CAN BUT- ON THE

03:12:03.645 --> 03:12:05.213
LAST BUT WHY TO KNOW. THAT IN

03:12:05.280 --> 03:12:05.881
AGREEMENT WITH ONE OF THE PANEL

03:12:05.947 --> 03:12:07.849
THAT IT IS A TO. PART OF THE

03:12:07.916 --> 03:12:08.416
SOLUTION BY WE ALSO BELIEVE

03:12:08.483 --> 03:12:09.918
THAT A BIG PART OF THE SOLUTION

03:12:09.985 --> 03:12:11.686
AS HOLDING PRODUCERS OF THESE

03:12:11.753 --> 03:12:13.321
POLLUTING PRODUCTS RESPONSIBLE

03:12:13.388 --> 03:12:15.657
FOR THE LIFE CYCLE OF THEIR-

03:12:15.724 --> 03:12:16.524
PRODUCTS ONCE THEY PUT THEM ON

03:12:16.591 --> 03:12:18.894
THE MARKET- AND WOULD LIKE TO

03:12:18.960 --> 03:12:21.329
SEE THAT CONSIDERED. AND WE ARE

03:12:21.396 --> 03:12:23.298
PROUD SPONSORS OF THEM- MACRO

03:12:23.365 --> 03:12:26.101
PLASTICS LEGISLATION THIS YEAR

03:12:26.167 --> 03:12:28.503
YOU- HELP REDUCE MICROPLASTIC

03:12:28.570 --> 03:12:31.907
THAT AT THE SOURCE. AND I ALSO

03:12:31.973 --> 03:12:33.308
JUST WANTED TO ADD SINCE THE

03:12:33.375 --> 03:12:35.377
LAST PRESENTER AT TERRY I

03:12:35.443 --> 03:12:37.479
WANTED TO ADD ON TO POINTS-

03:12:37.545 --> 03:12:38.613
THAT I DON'T KNOW IF CAME UP IN

03:12:38.680 --> 03:12:42.717
ANY OF THE SCIENTIFIC PANEL.

03:12:42.784 --> 03:12:43.919
BUT ONE IS THAT- BOTH

03:12:43.985 --> 03:12:46.354
MICROPLASTICS MICRO. PRODUCE

03:12:46.421 --> 03:12:47.889
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AS

03:12:47.956 --> 03:12:49.758
THEY BREAK DOWN A. B. HAPPY TO

03:12:49.824 --> 03:12:50.692
SEND OVER SOME OF THAT

03:12:50.759 --> 03:12:52.360
INFORMATION BUT THAT IS

03:12:52.427 --> 03:12:53.795
SOMETHING TO BE AWARE OF IN

03:12:53.862 --> 03:12:56.064
THAT- IN THIS WHOLE THING IS

03:12:56.131 --> 03:12:58.767
WE'RE LOOKING TO SOLUTION. AND

03:12:58.833 --> 03:13:01.803
ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT- EVEN

03:13:01.870 --> 03:13:03.605
THOUGH THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY

03:13:03.672 --> 03:13:05.440
HAS DONE A VERY GOOD JOB OF-

03:13:05.507 --> 03:13:06.875
SCARING THE PUBLIC INTO

03:13:06.942 --> 03:13:09.210
THINKING THAT- DISPOSABLES ARE

03:13:09.277 --> 03:13:10.412
SAFER TO USE DURING COLDER THAN

03:13:10.478 --> 03:13:12.747
THE REARS OF ALL. WE HAVE TO-

03:13:12.814 --> 03:13:14.549
GLOBAL HEALTH EXPERTS AND EVEN

03:13:14.616 --> 03:13:16.751
NOW AND U. S. HEALTH EXPERTS

03:13:16.818 --> 03:13:19.654
AGREEING THAT- JUST YOU KNOW AT

03:13:19.721 --> 03:13:21.022
THE LEAST AFFORDABLE THEY'RE

03:13:21.089 --> 03:13:22.223
NOT ANY SAFER THAN REASONABLE

03:13:22.290 --> 03:13:25.060

CONTINUING TO DISCUSS

03:13:29.397 --> 03:13:30.699
SOLUTIONS. TO THAT BUT THE

03:13:30.765 --> 03:13:31.866
MACRO PLASTICS AND

03:13:31.933 --> 03:13:36.905
MICROPLASTICS. PROBLEM THANK

03:13:36.972 --> 03:13:39.774
YOU VERY MUCH- NEXT. THANK YOU

03:13:39.841 --> 03:13:41.242

AHEAD. HELLO THIS IS ANDREA

03:13:44.713 --> 03:13:47.015
VENTURA WITH CLEAN WATER ACTION

03:13:47.082 --> 03:13:49.017
I WANT TO THANK YOU CHAIRED

03:13:53.755 --> 03:13:57.792
PRESENTATION- I NOTICED IN.

03:13:57.859 --> 03:13:59.260
DOING AN OVERVIEW OF THE

03:13:59.327 --> 03:14:00.662
LEGISLATION THIS YEAR THAT

03:14:00.729 --> 03:14:02.397
THERE ARE YOU KNOW NUMEROUS

03:14:02.464 --> 03:14:04.265
BILLS DEALING WITH WASTE MUCH

03:14:04.332 --> 03:14:05.600
OF IT NOT ALL OF IT THAT MUCH

03:14:05.667 --> 03:14:08.169
IT PLASTIC WASTE AND WE ARE

03:14:08.236 --> 03:14:10.905
GLAD TO SEE THAT- WE OBVIOUSLY

03:14:10.972 --> 03:14:12.240
ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

03:14:12.307 --> 03:14:14.676
IMPACTS. OF THESE MATERIALS IN

03:14:14.743 --> 03:14:16.811
OUR WATER AND ENVIRONMENT IN

03:14:16.878 --> 03:14:19.114
GENERAL- SO WE APPLAUD THAT BUT

03:14:19.180 --> 03:14:20.915
ONE THING THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO

03:14:20.982 --> 03:14:22.717
ASK THEM WHAT WE LOOK FOR IN

03:14:22.784 --> 03:14:24.853
BILLS- WITHIN THEIR PLASTIC OR

03:14:24.919 --> 03:14:26.888
ANY OTHER KIND OF- WASTE

03:14:26.955 --> 03:14:29.724
REDUCTION- THINKING. IS THAT

03:14:29.791 --> 03:14:31.326
THE FIRST OF ALL YOU KNOW EVERY

03:14:31.393 --> 03:14:33.595
BILL AND SEVERAL OF THESE DO

03:14:33.661 --> 03:14:34.963
YOU KNOW HAS TO REALLY LOOK AT

03:14:35.030 --> 03:14:36.264
SOURCE REDUCTION WE JUST HEARD

03:14:36.331 --> 03:14:37.699
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT WE

03:14:37.766 --> 03:14:40.702
CANNOT ULTIMATELY RECYCLE OUR

03:14:40.769 --> 03:14:42.837
WAY OUT OF OUR PROBLEMS WE HAVE

03:14:42.904 --> 03:14:45.073
TO STOP USING MATERIALS- SIMPLY

03:14:45.140 --> 03:14:47.876
DISPOSABLE- AND SO WE LOOK FOR

03:14:47.942 --> 03:14:49.444
THAT IN BILLS THAT ARE THERE

03:14:49.511 --> 03:14:51.346
THINGS THAT WILL. YOU KNOW THAT

03:14:51.413 --> 03:14:52.380
CAN BE PUT INTO LEGISLATION

03:14:52.447 --> 03:14:54.249
THAT WILL HELP PROMOTE FAT THE

03:14:54.315 --> 03:14:56.217
OTHER IS THAT WE HAVE TO BE

03:14:56.284 --> 03:14:57.585
VERY CAREFUL WITH ITS PLASTIC

03:14:57.652 --> 03:14:59.254
OR ANYTHING ELSE WHAT WE'RE

03:14:59.320 --> 03:15:01.689
RECYCLING ARE WE RECYCLING

03:15:01.756 --> 03:15:03.758
TOXIC CHEMICALS BACK INTO THE

03:15:03.825 --> 03:15:05.360
MARKET PLACE ARE WE JUST

03:15:05.427 --> 03:15:06.561
KEEPING THEM IN THE MARKET

03:15:06.628 --> 03:15:09.064
PLACE. AND YOU KNOW SO I THINK

03:15:09.130 --> 03:15:10.165
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS WE ALSO

03:15:10.231 --> 03:15:12.100
LOOK FOR IS LANGUAGE THAT WILL

03:15:12.167 --> 03:15:14.335
ADDRESS THAT CERTAIN THINGS WE

03:15:14.402 --> 03:15:16.438
DON'T WANT IN THE RECYCLING-

03:15:16.504 --> 03:15:18.106
ARENA WE DON'T WANT THESE

03:15:18.173 --> 03:15:19.240
