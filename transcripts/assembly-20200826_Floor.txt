SENATE BILL A FIFTY FIVE BY CENTER WIENER ANOTHER'S ACCOLADE HEALTH COVERAGE DOCTOR REGULARLY MAKE AN OPEN THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBER I RISE TODAY AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR TO PRESENT ON SENATE BILL EIGHT FIVE FIFTY FIVE ON BEHALF OF SENATOR WIENER. SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY FIVE REQUIRES HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS TO COVER MEDICALLY NECESSARY TREATMENT FOR ALL MEDICAL AND MENTAL OR EXCUSE ME ALL MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT. SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY FIVE ALSO CLARIFIES THAT HEALTH PLANS MUST ARRANGE TIMELY ACCESS TO OUT OF NETWORK CARE IN CASES WHERE AN N NETWORK PROVIDER CANNOT BE SECURED WITHIN THE EXISTING GEOGRAPHIC AND TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS. IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE THE CALIFORNIA MENTAL HEALTH PARITY ACT WAS ENACTED TO REQUIRE COVERAGE OF MEDICALLY NECESSARY TREATMENT FOR NINE SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESSES. THE MAJORITY OF MENTAL ILLNESSES AND ALL SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO ITS PROTECTIONS SOME OF THESE EXCLUDED CONDITIONS INCLUDE. PTSD GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER. OPIOID USE DISORDER ALCOHOL USE DISORDER BINGE EATING DISORDER AND MAJOR NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDER DUE TO TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY FIVE IS CRITICAL LEGISLATION FOR ENSURING CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITH MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS ARE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT WHEN ACCESSING NEEDED HEALTH CARE AND THAT INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE ALL MEDICALLY NECESSARY TREATMENT BEFORE THEY ARE IN CRISIS. WHEN PEOPLE CAN'T GET THE TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED THE COSTA SHIFTED ON TO MEDICAL AND TAXPAYERS IN THE FORM OF HOMELESSNESS DISABILITY AND UNNECESSARY INCARCERATION. THIS BILL GETS AT THE OOT OF MANY OF THESE SOCIAL ISSUES AND ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS IT BEFORE IT TAKES THE FORM OF SOMETHING MUCH GREATER. IT IS TIME THAT WE STOP FORCING PEOPLE THAT THE TO DESCEND INTO A CRISIS BEFORE THEIR HEALTH COVERAGE KICKS IN. THIS IS BEEN THE STATUS QUO FOR FAR TOO LONG. THE UC ANALYSIS FOUND THAT COVERING ALL MENTAL HEALTH. MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS WHAT INCREASE IN INSURANCE EXPENDITURES BY ONLY TWO POINT ZERO ZERO TWO PERCENT. THIS NEGLIGIBLE INCREASE IS ESSENTIALLY A ROUNDING ERROR BUT IT WILL COVER THE COST OF INSURING CALIFORNIANS SUFFERING WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS HAVE ACCESS TO NEEDED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. COLLEAGUES CALIFORNIA IS EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION CRISIS THAT IS ONLY WORSENING AS PEOPLE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH THE LASTING EFFECTS OF COVERT NINETEEN. THE NEGATIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF THIS PANDEMIC CAUSED BY THE PHYSICAL DISTANCING THE SOCIAL ISOLATION THE JOBLESSNESS THE FINANCIAL STRESS AND ANXIETY WILL BE FELT BY CALIFORNIANS. FOR YEARS TO COME. SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY FIVE IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE CALIFORNIANS RESPONSE TO THIS PANDEMIC IS SWIFT AND APPROPRIATE. SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY FIVE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE ACCESS TO MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTH CARE GIVING PEOPLE LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS THE ABILITY TO ACCESS TREATMENT SOONER. TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET AND TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. THANK A DOCTORATE LEVEL MISS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. ARE RISE ALSO AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF SB EIGHT FIVE FIVE WHICH WOULD FINALLY CREATE TO PARITY BETWEEN COVERAGE OF PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. COVERT NINETEEN HAS NOT ONLY COMPOUNDED CALIFORNIA'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS. BUT ALSO EXPOSE SEVERE GAPS IN OUR TREATMENT SYSTEM FOR EXAMPLE ACCORDING TO THE KENNEDY FORUM USE TREATMENT DID NOT RECEIVE IT. WHILE 60% OF ADULTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS DID NOT RECEIVE TREATMENT IN THE PAST YEAR. THE STANFORD INITIATIVE ON ADDICTION OF WHICH I AM A MEMBER. HAS STUDIES OF THE BRAIN SHOWING THAT THERE IS A DIRECT PHYSICAL CONNECTION BETWEEN ADDICTION. AND THE BRAIN. WHY DO WE CONTINUE TO NOT ADDRESS THE PARITY ISSUE BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. SB EIGHT FIVE FIVE MODERNIZES CALIFORNIA'S ARCHAIC PARITY LAW ENSURING COVERAGE OF MEDICALLY NECESSARY TREATMENT. FOR ALL MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS THIS BILL RECOGNIZES THE STRONG LINK BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES. AND IT WILL UNDOUBTEDLY INCREASE ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE WHILE ALSO DRIVING DOWN COSTS AYE ORIGIN AYE VOTE. THERE WAS WATER MISTER COOLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED COLLEAGUES I'M PLEASED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THIS BILL IS A GOOD UPDATE TO THE LOSS OF COVERAGE.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I'M PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT THE SENATE BILL NINE SEVEN TO THE CORPORATE DISCLOSURE ACT ON BEHALF OF SENATOR SKINNER. SB NINE SEVEN TWO WILL BETTER INFORM CALIFORNIA'S POLICY DECISIONS BY REQUIRING LARGE CORPORATIONS TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR TAX BURDEN. AND THE UTILIZATION OF STATE TAX CREDITS. EACH YEAR CALIFORNIA PROVIDES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TAX BENEFITS TO CORPORATIONS. WHAT TAX CREDITS ARE AN IMPORTANT TOOL THAT CAN HELP TO ADVANCE MANY LAUDABLE POLICY OBJECTIVES. CURRENT LAW ACTUALLY PREVENTS POLICYMAKERS AND THE PUBLIC FROM ACCESSING BASIC INFORMATION. SUCH AS THE SPECIFIC TAX CREDITS CLAIMED BY CORPORATION OR THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAID TO THE STATE. SB NINE SEVEN TWO. IS A MODEST AND PRACTICAL MEASURE THAT WILL LINE CALIFORNIA WITH NUMEROUS OTHER STATES THAT REQUIRE SUCH DISCLOSURE. AS WELL AS WITH FEDERAL POLICY THAT REQUIRES PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATIONS TO PROVIDE TAX INFORMATION TO THE SEC. TO BE CLEAR SB NINE SEVEN TWO DOES NOT INCREASE TAXES NOR DOES IT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO EXISTING TAX CREDIT. THE BILL SIMPLY REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF THREE BASIC DATA POINTS FOR CORPORATIONS WITH GROSS RECEIPTS OVER FIVE BILLION. THE TOTAL DOLLAR VALUE OF STATE TAX KIND OF TAX BENEFITS CLAIMS THE TYPES OF TAX CREDITS USED AND THE AMOUNT OF TAX PAID DIRECTLY TO THE STATE. THE INFORMATION WILL BE PROVIDED BY THE F. T. B. TO THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP INFORM OUR POLICY MAKING DECISIONS ESPECIALLY AS THEY RELATE TO TAXES AND OUR BUDGET PROCESS. SB NINE SEVEN TWO IS NOT DESIGNED TO PUBLICLY SHAME LARGE CORPORATIONS RATHER IT MERELY PROVIDES POLICYMAKERS AND THE PUBLIC WITH BASIC INFORMATION THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO CRAFTING SMART. DATA DRIVEN PUBLIC POLICY. SB NINE SEVEN TWO IS SPONSORED BY SEIU AND A COALITION OF LABOR ORGANIZATIONS AND IS AN IMPORTANT MODEST AND PRACTICAL STEP TO INCREASE PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY.
