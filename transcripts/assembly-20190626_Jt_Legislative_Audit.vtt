AT NEW LEGISLATION MAY VERY WELL

00:51:08.565 --> 00:51:10.000
BE IN ORDER BUT BEFORE WE CAN

00:51:10.066 --> 00:51:11.601
GET THERE WE NEED TO MEASURE THE

00:51:11.668 --> 00:51:12.836
SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM.

00:51:12.903 --> 00:51:14.171
THAT IS WHAT YET THAT SUPPORTS

00:51:14.237 --> 00:51:16.006
AN IMPARTIAL STATE AUDIT AND WE

00:51:16.072 --> 00:51:16.840
URGE YOU TO MOVE THIS SOLID

00:51:16.907 --> 00:51:17.941

DRIVER IN THIS ROOM AND EVERY

00:51:20.377 --> 00:51:24.281
DRIVER IN CALIFORNIA.

00:51:24.347 --> 00:51:25.382
PLEASE PROCEED GOING TO TURN

00:51:25.449 --> 00:51:25.949
MEMBERS KEVIN BAKER FOR THE

AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION

00:51:26.616 --> 00:51:29.386
OF CALIFORNIA WE REVEAL THE USE

00:51:29.453 --> 00:51:31.288
OF THIS TECHNOLOGY BY LIFE'S

00:51:31.354 --> 00:51:32.989
THROUGH PUBLIC INFORMATION OR

00:51:33.056 --> 00:51:34.925
REQUEST -- THE SENDER WIENER

00:51:34.991 --> 00:51:36.426
ALLUDED TO LEGISLATURE HAS

00:51:36.493 --> 00:51:38.795
RECOGNIZED THAT THIS IS POWERFUL

00:51:38.862 --> 00:51:40.564
TECHNOLOGY IT HAS ADOPTED

00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:43.099
STANDARDS FOR MINIMUM STANDARDS

00:51:43.166 --> 00:51:43.800
AT LEAST FOR USE.

00:51:43.867 --> 00:51:45.035
I THINK THE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE

00:51:45.101 --> 00:51:46.570
AT THIS POINT SUGGESTED THERE

00:51:46.636 --> 00:51:48.138
ARE SERIOUS QUESTIONS ABOUT

00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:49.706
COMPLIANCE UNFORTUNATELY I THINK

00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:51.675
THAT ARISES WHEN YOU HAVE A

00:51:51.741 --> 00:51:53.376
STATUTE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A

00:51:53.443 --> 00:51:55.812
ROBUST ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM --

00:51:55.879 --> 00:51:57.080
SO I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT

00:51:57.147 --> 00:51:58.748
THE COMMITTEE CONSIDER THIS

00:51:58.815 --> 00:52:00.851

VERY FIRST OBJECTIVE IS REALLY

00:52:10.393 --> 00:52:11.661
ASKING US TO TRY TO GET

00:52:11.728 --> 00:52:13.997
STATEWIDE INFORMATION -- AND

00:52:14.064 --> 00:52:15.565
JUST TO REMIND MEMBERS WE'VE

00:52:15.632 --> 00:52:17.067
DONE ON ITS IN THE PAST WHERE WE

00:52:17.133 --> 00:52:19.102
HAVE HAD TO SURVEY LOCAL LAW

00:52:19.169 --> 00:52:20.504
ENFORCEMENT WE RECENTLY DID AN

00:52:20.570 --> 00:52:22.639
AN AUDIT ON HATE CRIME REPORTING

00:52:22.706 --> 00:52:24.307
IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE WERE ABLE

00:52:24.374 --> 00:52:25.208

ENTITIES IN SOME STATE ENTITY SO

00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:30.647
THAT WOULD IN ALL LIKELIHOOD BE

00:52:30.714 --> 00:52:32.148
THE APPROACH WE WOULD USE THIS

00:52:32.215 --> 00:52:33.517
TO TO FIND OUT BECAUSE CENTER

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:35.051

ENTITIES ARE USING THIS.

00:52:37.954 --> 00:52:39.689
TECHNOLOGY WHAT POLICIES AND

00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:41.191
PROCEDURES DO THEY HAVE IN PLACE

00:52:41.258 --> 00:52:42.692
SO WE WOULD INTEND TO DO A

00:52:42.759 --> 00:52:44.160
SURVEY TO TRY TO CAPTURE THAT

00:52:44.227 --> 00:52:46.096

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:04.834
THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE SOFTWARE

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.369

I HAVE DOCUMENTED A MINIMUM OF A

01:11:29.218 --> 01:11:30.986
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY BUT I

01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:32.888
BELIEVE THAT'S A LOW NUMBER

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:34.356
THAT'S JUST BASED OFF OF US.

01:11:34.423 --> 01:11:36.492

THROUGH PROCUREMENT DATA -- SO

01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:43.198
IT'S THAT IS THAT IS THE LOW ONE

01:11:43.265 --> 01:11:44.667
WE'VE RECEIVED RECORDS FROM

01:11:44.733 --> 01:11:45.901
SIXTY AGENCIES WHICH ACCOUNTS

FOR MORE THAN A BILLION LICENSE

01:11:47.102 --> 01:11:50.406
PLATE SCANS I WOULD ADD THAT --

01:11:50.472 --> 01:11:52.741
WE'VE YET TO FIND -- SB THIRTY

01:11:52.808 --> 01:11:53.876

01:11:56.679 --> 01:11:58.480
KNOW THAT THAT IS ONE OF THE

01:11:58.547 --> 01:11:59.448
REASONS THAT WE ARE INTERESTED

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:00.883
IN SEEING THE OUTCOME OF AN

01:12:00.949 --> 01:12:01.817
AUDIT OF THEM BECAUSE WE JUST

01:12:01.884 --> 01:12:03.252
DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE USING IT

01:12:03.318 --> 01:12:04.386
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT COMPLIANT IN

01:12:04.453 --> 01:12:05.754
THAT REGARD.

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:07.756
IN HOW MANY -- ENTITIES USE

01:12:07.823 --> 01:12:12.361
VIGILANT SOLUTION OR COMPARABLE.

01:12:12.428 --> 01:12:12.895
TECHNOLOGY.

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:14.129
WE DON'T KNOW I THINK THAT --

01:12:14.196 --> 01:12:15.731
THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT IN THE

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:18.167
SPECTRUM OF COKE AND PEPSI THEY

01:12:18.233 --> 01:12:19.435
TEND TO BE THE COKE AND THEN

01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:21.103
THERE IS NO PEPSI IT JUST KIND

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:22.438
OF GOES DOWN TO MAYBE THERE'S AN

01:12:22.504 --> 01:12:24.606
RC COLA ISN'T SOME SAFE WAY

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:24.807
BRAND.

01:12:24.873 --> 01:12:26.942
BUT BUT THEY TEND TO HAVE THE

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:28.944
THE LARGEST MARKET SHARE AND ONE

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.446
REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THERE'S

01:12:30.512 --> 01:12:32.481
ONLY ONE IT CERTIFIED TRAINING

01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:33.916

01:12:40.055 --> 01:12:41.190
CERTIFICATION THEY'RE THE ONLY

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:43.726
ONES ABLE TO GIVE THAT TRAINING

01:12:43.792 --> 01:12:45.494
AND THEREFORE IT IS DIFFICULT

01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:46.228
HAVE OTHER VENDORS COMING IN

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:47.696
BECAUSE POLICE ARE ONLY GETTING

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:49.398
TRAINED ON ONE SYSTEM WHICH

01:12:49.465 --> 01:12:50.733
OFTEN TENDS TO BE A SORT OF

01:12:50.799 --> 01:12:53.235
MARKETING SEMINAR SLASH TRAINING

01:12:53.302 --> 01:12:54.303
SEMINAR.

01:12:54.369 --> 01:12:56.271
OKAY ANNA AND CENTER I THINK ONE

01:12:56.338 --> 01:12:58.340
OF THE AS YOUR SERVICE HEARING

01:12:58.407 --> 01:13:00.242
THERE IS A LACK OF SORT OF

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:02.611
COMPREHENSIVE DATA JUST BASIC

01:13:02.678 --> 01:13:04.413
INFORMATION EVEN HOW MANY CITIES

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:09.551
ACTUALLY DO IT -- AND SO ONE OF

01:13:09.618 --> 01:13:11.487
THE PURPOSES OF THIS AUDIT IS TO

01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:13.055
DO THE STATE WIDE SAYS GENERAL

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:14.456
LOG SO WE CAN GET A LAY OF THE

01:13:14.523 --> 01:13:15.424
LAND.

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:16.825
AND THEN DO THE DEEP DIVE INTO

01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:17.192
AND A SUBSET.

01:13:17.259 --> 01:13:18.427
AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE I'M

01:13:18.494 --> 01:13:19.595
GOING WITH -- WITH MY MY MY

01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:22.097
QUESTIONS I'M NORMALLY A FIERCE

01:13:22.164 --> 01:13:24.133
ADVOCATE.

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:26.368
A PROPONENT OF ASKING QUESTIONS

01:13:26.435 --> 01:13:28.403
GETTING INFORMATION.

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:29.404
HI.

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:31.373
THERE'S A LITTLE BUZZING IN MY

01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:33.008
EAR ON THIS ONE THOUGH.

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:35.577
AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S IF IT'S

01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:38.213
BECAUSE FRESNO WAS CHOSEN AS A

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.382
LOCATION -- RIGHT NOW WE'RE

01:13:40.449 --> 01:13:43.552
LOOKING AT LA AND FRESNO I THINK

01:13:43.619 --> 01:13:46.054
YOU MENTIONED SACRAMENTO AND

01:13:46.121 --> 01:13:47.022
MORAN.

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:50.259
BUT THE TWO CITIES ARE THAT WE

01:13:50.325 --> 01:13:51.860
ARE GONNA BE LOOKED AT IN MORE

01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:54.830
DETAIL EARLY IN FRESNO.

01:13:54.897 --> 01:13:56.498
AND THAT KIND OF PEAKS MY

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:57.933
INTEREST IN THE PEAKS MY

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.269
INTEREST BECAUSE IT'S NOT

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:03.071
UNCOMMON IT'S NOT UNCOMMON

01:14:03.138 --> 01:14:05.607
KNOWLEDGE THAT FRESNO -- HAS HAD --

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:07.843
POLITICAL LEADERSHIP -- IN THE

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:10.078
PAST -- THAT HAS TRIED TO FIGURE

01:14:10.145 --> 01:14:13.415
OUT THE ROLE OF THE SHERIFF.

01:14:13.482 --> 01:14:15.450
AND LAW ENFORCEMENT LAW ON

01:14:15.517 --> 01:14:17.386
IMMIGRATION RELATED ISSUES MY

01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:18.954
COLLEAGUE FROM CARMEL POINTED

01:14:19.021 --> 01:14:20.222
THAT OUT SPECIFICALLY.

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:23.492
ON THE VARIOUS CONFLICTS OF

01:14:23.559 --> 01:14:24.860
INFORMATION SHARED BETWEEN.

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:27.129
OUR ENTITIES INVOLVING THE STATE.

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:29.731
AND THE RULES THAT PERTAIN AT

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:30.365
THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

01:14:30.432 --> 01:14:33.001
AND SO MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS

01:14:33.068 --> 01:14:35.170
APPEARS TO BE A BIT NINE INQUIRY

01:14:35.237 --> 01:14:37.739
INTO THIS AREA OF PRACTICE AND

01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:39.141
STUDY.

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:42.978
IS THERE ANOTHER REASON THAT THE

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:44.880
THAT FRESNO WAS CHOSEN.

01:14:44.947 --> 01:14:46.481
THAT -- IT HONESTLY HAVE TO

01:14:46.548 --> 01:14:48.417
ANSWER THAT RIGHT NOW BUT IT IS

01:14:48.483 --> 01:14:51.053
CAUSING ME SOME CONCERN -- THAT --

01:14:51.119 --> 01:14:54.256
THIS IS BEING BACK TOWARD INTO

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:56.124
IMMIGRATION DISCUSSION NOT A

01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:57.960
TRADITIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:14:58.026 --> 01:15:00.729
PRIVACY RELATED TO REQUIRE

01:15:00.796 --> 01:15:05.133
ANALYSTS MR MAS TO FOLLOW UP.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:05.701
AS WOULD BE VERY TRANSPARENT

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:06.635
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:08.604
WE'RE INTERESTED IN IS.

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:10.305
COORDINATION WHERE WITH ICING

01:15:10.372 --> 01:15:12.107
USE OF THIS DATA.

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:13.876
IN TERMS OF ICE SO EVEN THAT WAS

01:15:13.942 --> 01:15:15.277
AND I REQUEST WE'RE NOT HIDING

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.679
FROM THAT THAT'S NOT THE PRIMARY

01:15:17.746 --> 01:15:18.513
REASON WE'RE DOING THIS THIS IS

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:19.581
JUST.

01:15:19.648 --> 01:15:20.949
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT OVERALL

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:23.619
HELLO WHERE IS THIS BEING USED

01:15:23.685 --> 01:15:25.554
HELL HELL PREVALENT IS THE OUR

01:15:25.621 --> 01:15:27.055
CITIES COMPLYING.

01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:28.590
AND COUNTIES AND AGENCIES

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:30.425
COMPLYING WITH SB THIRTY FOUR

01:15:30.492 --> 01:15:31.526
ARE THERE ANY CHANGES IN THE LAW

01:15:31.593 --> 01:15:33.462
WE NEED TO MAKE THAT'S THE

01:15:33.528 --> 01:15:34.930
PURPOSE OF IT BUT ALL I HAD

01:15:34.997 --> 01:15:36.965
LITTLE TO MR MAS SO IT IN THE

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:37.866
PROCESS SO FIRST WE WANT TO

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:39.001
SPREAD THESE AROUND HE STATE.

01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:40.135
SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:41.370
WE WONDERED AND SEVENTY

01:15:41.436 --> 01:15:43.472
LOCATIONS USING RC COLA COKE AND

01:15:43.538 --> 01:15:45.574
PEPSI EXACTLY SO FRESNO IS ON

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:47.342
THAT LIST SO WHEN WE STARTED

01:15:47.409 --> 01:15:48.911
RESEARCHING THIS WE RECEIVED A

01:15:48.977 --> 01:15:50.846
COPY OF THE DATA SHARING REPORT

01:15:50.913 --> 01:15:51.446
FROM.

01:15:51.513 --> 01:15:53.048
THE HAWTHORNE POLICE DEPARTMENT

01:15:53.115 --> 01:15:54.616
WHICH INDICATED THE DATA FROM

01:15:54.683 --> 01:15:55.984
HAWTHORNE WAS BEING SHARED WITH

01:15:56.051 --> 01:15:57.419
SOMETHING CALLED THE FRESNO

01:15:57.486 --> 01:15:59.788
FASHION MALL A FASHION MALL

01:15:59.855 --> 01:16:01.757
SECURITY WE DIDN'T KNOW WE DON'T

01:16:01.823 --> 01:16:02.925
KNOW WHO IS RECEIVING A STATE IT

01:16:02.991 --> 01:16:04.259
SOUNDED LIKE A PRIVATE ENTITY.

01:16:04.326 --> 01:16:05.761
WHEN WE ASKED HAWTHORNE THEY

01:16:05.827 --> 01:16:07.562
SAID WE DON'T KNOW TALK TO

01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:09.264
FRESNO POLICE DEPARTMENT SO BOTH

01:16:09.331 --> 01:16:10.933
EFF AND THE CENTER FOR HUMAN

01:16:10.999 --> 01:16:12.601
RIGHTS AND PRIVACY?

01:16:12.668 --> 01:16:13.869
PASSED FRESNO OVER AND OVER

01:16:13.936 --> 01:16:15.470
AGAIN WHAT IS THE DEAL WITH THIS

01:16:15.537 --> 01:16:17.039
AND WE NEVER RECEIVED ANY KIND

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:18.440
OF RESPONSE.

01:16:18.507 --> 01:16:19.975
SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE THE

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:21.076
EVIDENCE ON WHITE HIGHLY FRESNO

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:21.576
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH

01:16:21.643 --> 01:16:23.478
IMMIGRATION BUT BECAUSE WE

01:16:23.545 --> 01:16:25.180
WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:26.515
THERE WERE SECURITY GUARDS AT A

01:16:26.581 --> 01:16:28.317
MALL RECEIVING THIS DATA WHETHER

01:16:28.383 --> 01:16:30.218
THERE WAS A POLICE SUBSTATION AT

01:16:30.285 --> 01:16:31.553
THE MALL THAT WAS RECEIVING THIS

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:31.753
DATA.

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:32.387
I MEAN BECAUSE CERTAINLY I THINK

01:16:32.454 --> 01:16:33.555
WE'D ALL BE CONCERNED IF THERE

01:16:33.622 --> 01:16:35.657
WERE MALL COPS WHO WERE ABLE TO

01:16:35.724 --> 01:16:36.591
SEARCH.

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:37.759
YOU KNOW PEOPLE'S LOCATIONAL

01:16:37.826 --> 01:16:40.262
DATA WITHOUT ANY OVERSIGHT FROM

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:41.096
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HELLO ALL

01:16:41.163 --> 01:16:42.664
IN MY QUESTIONS HERE I THINK I

01:16:42.731 --> 01:16:43.699
WOULD FEEL CERTAINLY MORE

01:16:43.765 --> 01:16:44.800
COMFORTABLE.

01:16:44.866 --> 01:16:47.302
THAT IF YOU HAD A STRONG URBAN

01:16:47.369 --> 01:16:50.639
INST AND RURAL -- SAMPLE.

01:16:50.706 --> 01:16:53.442
AND YOU CRATER THRESHOLD AND

01:16:53.508 --> 01:16:56.378
ESSENTIALLY -- LOTTERY DID IT AS

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:59.481
A DECISION -- I WOULD FEEL FOR

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:08.090
MORE COMFORTABLE YOU KNOW -- NOT

01:17:08.156 --> 01:17:08.690
THROWN BAKERSFIELD IN THE BUS

01:17:08.757 --> 01:17:10.559
BUT BUT SOMETHING ALONG THOSE

01:17:10.625 --> 01:17:11.593
LINES -- ONLY BECAUSE THE

01:17:11.660 --> 01:17:13.128
SELECTION OF OF THIS AREA GIVEN

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:15.263
THE POLITICAL HISTORY -- I IS OF

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:16.898
CONCERN.

01:17:16.965 --> 01:17:18.233
RIGHT THANK YOU AND YOU KNOW AND

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:19.167
MY UNDERSTANDING IS WORKING WITH

01:17:19.234 --> 01:17:20.135
THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS AS WE'RE

01:17:20.202 --> 01:17:22.371
TRYING TO GET REGIONAL --

01:17:22.437 --> 01:17:23.905
SAMPLES FROM ACROSS THE STATE

01:17:23.972 --> 01:17:24.206
[inaudible]

01:17:24.272 --> 01:17:26.274
ROLL URBAN.

01:17:26.341 --> 01:17:27.175

THEIR THEIR GOOD PRACTICES IT'S

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:41.890
NOT ABOUT A GOTCHA -- WE FOUND

01:17:41.957 --> 01:17:44.192
THAT SOME -- ENTITIES THAT WE'VE

01:17:44.259 --> 01:17:45.827
AUDITED IN THE PAST HAVE HAVE

01:17:45.894 --> 01:17:47.696

01:19:17.219 --> 01:19:17.719
GET THE AUDIT IS GOING TO

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:19.688
BASICALLY LOOK AT THE PRACTICES

01:19:19.754 --> 01:19:21.823
AND ARE YOU -- IN COMPLIANCE

01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:23.992
WITH THE PARTICULAR UNDERLYING

01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:28.230
LAW CAN YOU LAY OUT HOW FRESNO.

01:19:28.296 --> 01:19:30.165
THE INITIATED TO THE TECHNOLOGY

01:19:30.232 --> 01:19:33.368
WENT THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION.

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:37.239
AND HIGHLIGHT IF YOU CAN.

01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:39.908
THAT PROCESS AS BEING IN KEEPING

01:19:39.975 --> 01:19:46.715
WITH THE UNDERLYING LAW.

01:19:46.781 --> 01:19:49.284
SURE SO IN IN FRESNO LIKE I I

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:52.654
MENTIONED WE WE'VE HAD -- P. R..

01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:54.389
FOR I THINK ABOUT A DECADE I WAS

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:55.524
A PART OF THAT BUT WE HAD AN OP

01:19:55.590 --> 01:19:58.293
OUR SYSTEM THAT WE USED IN

01:19:58.360 --> 01:19:59.628
CONJUNCTION WITH CLOVIS PD.

01:19:59.694 --> 01:20:02.564
AND ALL THAT DATA WAS WAS HOSTED --

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:04.799
AT CLOVIS BUT IT WAS A

01:20:04.866 --> 01:20:05.367
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO

01:20:05.433 --> 01:20:06.067
AGENCIES.

01:20:06.134 --> 01:20:07.569
AND THEN MORE RECENTLY AS THE

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:10.438
TECHNOLOGY EVOLVED -- WE TESTED

01:20:10.505 --> 01:20:12.440
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES DIFFERENT

01:20:12.507 --> 01:20:14.776
LPR SOLUTIONS -- WITH YOU KNOW

01:20:14.843 --> 01:20:17.312
FIX READERS AND MOBILE READERS.

01:20:17.379 --> 01:20:19.648
AND FOR FRESNO WE DECIDED THAT

01:20:19.714 --> 01:20:21.750
MOBILE READERS WOULD -- GET US

01:20:21.816 --> 01:20:23.418
THE MOST BANG FOR THE BUCK

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:25.420
BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW FRESNO IS

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:26.354
HUNDRED FIFTEEN SQUARE MILES

01:20:26.421 --> 01:20:28.757
IT'S JUST SPREAD OUT. TO GET ANY

01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:29.291
KIND OF COVERAGE OF FIXED

01:20:29.357 --> 01:20:31.059
READERS -- WOULD HAVE BEEN A

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:32.794
HUGE EXPENSE SO WE WENT WITH THE

01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:33.995
MOBILE READERS.

01:20:34.062 --> 01:20:35.997
AND ALSO WITH THE INTENTION OF

01:20:36.064 --> 01:20:38.099
USING THOSE TO ASSIST US WITH

01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:41.136
SOME OF OUR OUR INVESTIGATIONS --

01:20:41.203 --> 01:20:43.471
SO WE HAVE A LARGE -- CRIME

01:20:43.538 --> 01:20:45.207
SCENE -- WE CAN ALWAYS ROLE AN

01:20:45.273 --> 01:20:46.841
LP OUR CAR THROUGH THAT SCENE TO

01:20:46.908 --> 01:20:48.476
ASSIST THE INVESTIGATORS LATER

01:20:48.543 --> 01:20:50.512
ON WITH -- WITH ANY VEHICLES

01:20:50.579 --> 01:20:51.112
THAT WERE IN THE AREA AT THE

01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:53.448
TIME OF THE CRIME.

01:20:53.515 --> 01:20:54.182
IT CETERA.

01:20:54.249 --> 01:20:57.419
SO WE DISCOVERED -- THE COMPANY

01:20:57.485 --> 01:20:58.186
VIGILANT SOLUTIONS THIS BEEN

01:20:58.253 --> 01:21:02.190
MENTIONED -- THE THE VALUE FOR

01:21:02.257 --> 01:21:04.159
US WITH -- MOVING FORWARD WITH

01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:06.461
VIGILANT WAS THE AMOUNT OF DATA

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:07.929
THAT THEY BROUGHT TO THE TABLE

01:21:07.996 --> 01:21:09.531
AND PROVIDED.

01:21:09.598 --> 01:21:11.533
SO IN THE WHAT I'LL CALL THE

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.035
GREATER FRESNO AREA -- THAT YOU

01:21:14.102 --> 01:21:15.437
KNOW INCLUDES THE SMALLER CITIES

01:21:15.503 --> 01:21:18.907
SURROUNDING FRESNO -- THEY DO

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:20.375
AROUND A MILLION DETECTIONS A

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:21.276
MONTH.

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:23.278
IS WHAT VIGILANT PUTS INTO THE

01:21:23.345 --> 01:21:24.479
SYSTEM.

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:27.415
SO IN ADDITION TO THAT -- THE

01:21:27.482 --> 01:21:30.318
DETECTIONS -- THAT OR A

01:21:30.385 --> 01:21:31.152
COLLECTED BY THE FRESNO POLICE

01:21:31.219 --> 01:21:33.755
DEPARTMENT CAMERAS ALSO ARE ARE

01:21:33.822 --> 01:21:35.423
ALL SEARCHABLE WITHIN THE SAME

01:21:35.490 --> 01:21:38.960
DATABASE -- USING THE SAME USER

01:21:39.027 --> 01:21:40.729
INTERFACE.

01:21:40.795 --> 01:21:42.030
SO THAT THAT HAD A LOT OF VALUE

01:21:42.097 --> 01:21:43.164
TO US HAVING ALL OF THAT

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:44.799
INFORMATION IN ONE PLACE IN

01:21:44.866 --> 01:21:47.102
ADDITION WE HAD ACCESS TO

01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:49.137
VIGILANT SOLUTION DETECTIONS

01:21:49.204 --> 01:21:50.605
FROM ACROSS THE NATION SO.

01:21:50.672 --> 01:21:52.207
SO ALL OF THAT DATA WAS IN ONE

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:55.810
PLACE -- YOU PAY A SUBSCRIPTION

01:21:55.877 --> 01:21:57.746
TO HAVE ACCESS TO THEIR DATA AND

01:21:57.812 --> 01:21:59.748
THEN -- YOUR DATA CAN GO INTO

01:21:59.814 --> 01:22:02.884
THE SAME SYSTEM -- THE LAW

01:22:02.951 --> 01:22:04.686
ENFORCEMENT DATA THAT GOES INTO

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:05.687
THEIR SYSTEM I IT WAS MENTIONED

01:22:05.754 --> 01:22:09.157
EARLIER THAT DATA BELONGS -- TO

01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:11.493
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY --

01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:13.895
AND THAT'S NOT CO MINGLED WITH

01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:16.064
THE COMMERCIAL DATA -- FROM THE

01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:19.067
VIGILANT SIDE -- IT WAS

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:20.902
MENTIONED BUT SENSE THAT THERE

01:22:20.969 --> 01:22:22.604
IS A SEPARATION THEN.

01:22:22.671 --> 01:22:24.205
BETWEEN TYPES OF DATA.

01:22:24.272 --> 01:22:26.975
YES AND THAT THE PROPRIETARY

01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:28.877
RESPONSIBILITY OF THAT DATA

01:22:28.943 --> 01:22:29.511
RESTS WITH THE FRESNO POLICE TO

01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:35.784
PARK -- YOU HAVE IT AND DO WHAT

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:39.020
WITH IT I I DON'T OUR DATA IS IS --

01:22:39.087 --> 01:22:41.656
SENT TO THEIR SERVERS -- BUT THE

01:22:41.723 --> 01:22:44.259
DATA IS NOT -- COMMINGLED ARE

01:22:44.326 --> 01:22:45.393
MIXED.

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:46.494
SO THE LAW ENFORCEMENT DATA IT

01:22:46.561 --> 01:22:47.729
REMAINS LAW ENFORCEMENT DATA

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:49.664
IT'S NOT AVAILABLE TO THE

01:22:49.731 --> 01:22:52.367
COMMERCIAL SIDE -- I SUPPOSE

01:22:52.434 --> 01:22:53.335
UNLESS THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:22:53.401 --> 01:22:54.803
AGENCY CHOOSES TO SHARE THAT

01:22:54.869 --> 01:22:56.671
WITH THE COMMERCIAL SIDE -- BUT

01:22:56.738 --> 01:22:58.907
THE COMMERCIAL DATA IS AVAILABLE

01:22:58.973 --> 01:22:59.507
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT SO IN THAT

01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:00.442
CASE THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:04.179
WITH THE FRESNO FASHION FAIR --

01:23:04.245 --> 01:23:06.981

HOW YOU CAN REACH ME I WOULD

WHILE YOU'RE HERE -- CERTAINLY

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:16.391
SO YEAH APPARENTLY HAWTHORNE

01:23:16.458 --> 01:23:18.860
CHOSE TO SHARE THEIR DETECTIONS

01:23:18.927 --> 01:23:21.096
WITH THE FRESNO FASHION FAIR

01:23:21.162 --> 01:23:22.297
MALL SECURITY.

01:23:22.364 --> 01:23:24.032
THE FRESNO FASHION FAIR MALL

01:23:24.099 --> 01:23:25.800

01:23:25.867 --> 01:23:27.168
PLATE READER CAMERAS I BELIEVE

01:23:27.235 --> 01:23:28.703
IN ONE OF THE VEHICLES.

01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:31.373

01:23:31.439 --> 01:23:34.509
AND THAT INFORMATION GOES INTO

01:23:34.576 --> 01:23:35.744

01:28:33.574 --> 01:28:35.076
LITTLE SUSPICIOUS ABOUT WHY

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:54.402
IF IN FACT WE WOULD WANT TO

01:32:54.468 --> 01:32:56.604
CONFIRM THAT THEY HAVE NO LONGER

01:32:56.671 --> 01:32:58.272
THERE THE DEPARTMENT HUMAN.

01:32:58.339 --> 01:32:59.840
ASSISTANCE IN SACRAMENTO IS NO

01:32:59.907 --> 01:33:01.375
LONGER USING THAT TECHNOLOGY IF

01:33:01.442 --> 01:33:02.576
THERE'S SENATOR WIENER IS

01:33:02.643 --> 01:33:04.211
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT WHERE WE

01:33:04.278 --> 01:33:05.646
WE DON'T LOOK BACK AND SEE WHAT

01:33:05.713 --> 01:33:06.447
THEY HAD DONE IN THE PAST

01:33:06.514 --> 01:33:08.616
BECAUSE WE CONFIRM OR VERIFY

01:33:08.683 --> 01:33:10.584
THAT THEY'RE NO LONGER USING --

01:33:10.651 --> 01:33:12.153
THE TECHNOLOGY THEN THAT WOULD

01:33:12.219 --> 01:33:13.621
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF HOURS AND

01:33:13.688 --> 01:33:15.022
NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE JOB

01:33:15.089 --> 01:33:16.057

01:33:17.191 --> 01:33:19.593
ENTITY -- ROUGHLY THAT WOULD

01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:22.129

TWENTY HOURS -- AS AS FAR AS THE

01:33:24.432 --> 01:33:26.033
THE BUDGET ITSELF BECAUSE THE

01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:27.668
VAST MAJORITY OF THE HOURS WERE

01:33:27.735 --> 01:33:29.270
GOING TO EXPAND.

ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:33:40.414 --> 01:33:41.315

01:33:41.382 --> 01:33:42.984
THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND CERTAINLY

01:33:43.050 --> 01:33:46.253

IS AS AS SHE INDICATED ANY

01:43:54.895 --> 01:43:56.697
INTERACTIONS BETWEEN NOW THE

PRIVATE CONSULTANTS.

01:44:01.468 --> 01:44:03.170
WITH RESPECT TO THE PREVIOUS

01:44:03.236 --> 01:44:04.838
AUDIT WE HAD ISSUED -- BACK IN

01:44:04.905 --> 01:44:07.007
MARCH OF TWENTY SIXTEEN THAT WAS

01:44:07.074 --> 01:44:08.609
RELATED TO NON RESIDENT --

01:44:08.675 --> 01:44:10.143
ADMISSIONS AND RESIDENT AND THAT

01:44:10.210 --> 01:44:11.645
MORE NON RESIDENT STUDENTS HAD

01:44:11.712 --> 01:44:13.246
BEEN ADMITTED TO CALIFORNIA OUR

01:44:13.313 --> 01:44:15.248
UNIVERSITIES SHE'S ASKING US TO

01:44:15.315 --> 01:44:17.417
LOOK AT THE EFFICIENCY AND

01:44:17.484 --> 01:44:19.119
ESSENTIALLY WHATIS YOU SEE DONE

01:44:19.186 --> 01:44:21.555
TO REACT TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS --

01:44:21.622 --> 01:44:22.656
THAT WERE MADE IN THAT REPORT

01:44:22.723 --> 01:44:24.324
BUT SHE'S ALSO ASKING US TO LOOK

01:44:24.391 --> 01:44:26.293
AT TRENDS OVER THE LAST FEW

01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:27.894
YEARS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S

01:44:27.961 --> 01:44:29.262
THERE HAS BEEN ANY CHANGE.

01:44:29.329 --> 01:44:31.198
AS TO THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS

01:44:31.264 --> 01:44:33.200
STUDENTS ADMITTED TO UC SCHOOLS

01:44:33.266 --> 01:44:34.968
ARE COMPARED TO NON RESIDENT

01:44:35.035 --> 01:44:36.169
STUDENTS ON THE BUDGET FOR THIS

01:44:36.236 --> 01:44:37.838
SITE IT'S ABOUT THIRTY FOUR

01:44:37.904 --> 01:44:38.338
HUNDRED HOURS.

01:44:38.405 --> 01:44:39.806
AGAIN THAT'S BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA

01:44:39.873 --> 01:44:41.441
DO SOME WORK SYSTEM WIDE I KNOW

01:44:41.508 --> 01:44:43.310
THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT REPORT

01:44:43.377 --> 01:44:45.512
ISSUED BY THE UC AUDITOR I KNOW

01:44:45.579 --> 01:44:46.279
HE'S IN THE AUDIENCE I'M NOT

01:44:46.346 --> 01:44:46.680
GOING.

01:44:46.747 --> 01:44:48.248
TO SPEAK TO IT TO THE SPECIFICS

01:44:48.315 --> 01:44:50.183
OF HIS PARTICULAR REPORT I DID

01:44:50.250 --> 01:44:51.718
REVIEW IT IT'S BASICALLY JUST

01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:53.353
LOOKING TO SEE ABOUT THE

01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:55.155
EXISTENCE OF POLICIES IT'S KIND

01:44:55.222 --> 01:44:56.623
OF A CONTROL REVIEW.

01:44:56.690 --> 01:44:58.392
LOOKING AT WHAT POLICIES TO EACH

01:44:58.458 --> 01:45:00.127
OF THE CAMPUSES HAVE ARE THEIR

01:45:00.193 --> 01:45:02.129
WEAKNESSES IN THOSE POLICY SO TO

01:45:02.195 --> 01:45:03.163
THE EXTENT WE CAN RELY ON THAT

01:45:03.230 --> 01:45:04.598
WORK IN THE EVENT DECIDED IS

01:45:04.665 --> 01:45:05.432
APPROVED.

01:45:05.499 --> 01:45:06.566
THAT WOULD REDUCE SOME OF THE

01:45:06.633 --> 01:45:07.701
AMOUNT OF TIME WE WOULD HAVE TO

01:45:07.768 --> 01:45:09.603
SPEND DOING THAT BUT I THINK THE

AS FAR AS PRESIDENT IT'S REALLY

01:55:08.067 --> 01:55:09.802
BEEN MORE OF A DELAY -- IN

01:55:09.869 --> 01:55:11.037

01:55:11.104 --> 01:55:12.405
IF THE COMMITTEE WOULD APPROVE A

POLICIES BECAUSE THERE IS

01:55:49.309 --> 01:55:51.778

US TO LOOK AT A FIVE YEAR WINDOW.

02:08:21.326 --> 02:08:22.628
AND LOOK AT THE PROCESS FOR

02:08:22.694 --> 02:08:24.029
ORIGINATING APPROVING

02:08:24.096 --> 02:08:25.264
IMPLEMENTING A FEE IF THERE HAVE

02:08:25.330 --> 02:08:27.299
BEEN FEE INCREASES HOW DID THAT

02:08:27.366 --> 02:08:28.133
HAPPEN.

A STUDENT REFERENDUM DID THAT

02:08:31.770 --> 02:08:34.039
OCCUR -- IF THE STUDENTS

INCREASE WAS IT WAS IT.

02:08:38.677 --> 02:08:40.012
SATISFIED IN SOME OTHER WAY.

02:08:40.079 --> 02:08:40.979
IS A QUESTION SHE'S ASKED

02:08:44.683 --> 02:08:47.186
RESPECT TO THE COST OF ATTENDING

02:08:47.252 --> 02:08:49.254
THOSE FOR PARTICULAR

02:08:49.321 --> 02:08:51.190
INSTITUTIONS -- TO THE EXTENT

02:08:51.256 --> 02:08:52.491
POSSIBLE WE WILL DETERMINE

02:08:52.558 --> 02:08:54.359
WHETHER OR NOT STUDENTS ARE ABLE

02:08:54.426 --> 02:08:55.727
TO USE FINANCIAL AID TO IT TO

02:08:55.794 --> 02:08:57.196
PAY FOR SOME OF THE SPECIES.

02:08:57.262 --> 02:08:58.063
AND LOOKING AT SOME OF THE

BACKGROUND MATERIALS TO PREPARE

FOR THE HEARING I SAW THERE ARE

02:09:01.333 --> 02:09:01.867
SOME INSTANCES WHERE STUDENTS

02:09:01.934 --> 02:09:03.602
CANNOT USE FINANCIAL AID.

02:09:03.669 --> 02:09:04.937
SO THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE

02:09:05.003 --> 02:09:05.938
STUDENTS ARE HAVING TO PAY THIS

02:09:06.004 --> 02:09:07.539
OUT OF POCKET AND WE WOULD BE

02:09:07.606 --> 02:09:08.607
ABLE.

02:09:08.674 --> 02:09:09.942
TO CONDUCT THAT TYPE OF ANALYSIS

02:09:10.008 --> 02:09:11.910
DETERMINE WHICH FEES OUR

02:09:11.977 --> 02:09:13.445

02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:16.548
WHICH THEY CANNOT -- WHAT

02:09:16.615 --> 02:09:18.250
ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES ARE EACH

02:09:18.317 --> 02:09:20.519
OF THE CAMPUS'S ENGAGING IN TO

02:09:20.586 --> 02:09:21.987
MAKE SURE THAT IF THE FEE

02:09:22.054 --> 02:09:23.555
REVENUE IS GENERATED FOR A

02:09:23.622 --> 02:09:25.057
PARTICULAR PURPOSE THAT THE

02:09:25.124 --> 02:09:26.859
EXPENDITURES AND WE WOULD TEST

02:09:26.925 --> 02:09:28.393
EXPENDITURES TO MAKE SURE?

02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:29.928
THAT THOSE CAMPUSES WERE ONLY

02:09:29.995 --> 02:09:31.530
USING THOSE FUNDS FOR THOSE

02:09:31.597 --> 02:09:33.465
PARTICULAR PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE

02:09:33.532 --> 02:09:34.800
ASSURANCE KNOWING TO STUDENTS

02:09:34.867 --> 02:09:35.667

PUBLIC THAT.

02:09:36.635 --> 02:09:37.569
THE INSTITUTIONS ARE BEING

02:09:37.636 --> 02:09:40.606
FISCAL STEWARDS OF THESE FUNDS

02:09:40.672 --> 02:09:41.507
ARE THE REVENUES THAT ARE

02:09:41.573 --> 02:09:43.575
GENERATED -- AND THEN A COUPLE

02:09:43.642 --> 02:09:45.377
OF FINAL OBJECTIVES DETERMINE

LIST FOR FEES.

02:16:15.333 --> 02:16:16.535
AND ANOTHER THAT A LOT OF

02:16:16.601 --> 02:16:18.103
STUDENTS ARE COME FROM MY

02:16:18.169 --> 02:16:19.304
DISTRICT TO GO TO SOME OF THE

02:16:19.371 --> 02:16:21.373
STATE UNIVERSITY IS IS RIGHT UP

02:16:21.439 --> 02:16:23.608
THERE AS WELL SO. TO TO THE TOP

02:16:23.675 --> 02:16:25.510
FOR FEES.

02:16:25.577 --> 02:16:28.179
AREAS ARE ARE ARE NEAR AND DEAR

02:16:28.246 --> 02:16:30.515
TO MY CAN MY CONSTITUENTS --

02:16:30.582 --> 02:16:31.883
THERE SEEMS TO BE GREAT

02:16:31.950 --> 02:16:34.553
DISPARITY ACROSS THESE AS FAR AS

02:16:34.619 --> 02:16:36.288
THE AMOUNTS FOR TWO PARTICULAR

02:16:36.354 --> 02:16:37.789
FEES.

02:16:37.856 --> 02:16:39.224
I GUESS WHEN I THINK OF IN

02:16:39.291 --> 02:16:41.126
STRUCTURAL INSTRUCTION ONLY

02:16:41.192 --> 02:16:43.295
RELATED ACTIVITIES I THINK THOSE

02:16:43.361 --> 02:16:45.196
ARE THINGS THAT FEEL LIKE THEY

02:16:45.263 --> 02:16:45.797
SHOULD BE WRITTEN PARTY YOUR

02:16:45.864 --> 02:16:47.032
TUITION.

02:16:47.098 --> 02:16:48.366
I UNDERSTAND COURSE MATERIALS

02:16:48.433 --> 02:16:50.201
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT AS

02:16:50.268 --> 02:16:52.304
SOMEONE WHO HAD A SCIENCE --

02:16:52.370 --> 02:16:53.805
BACKGROUND THE BOOKS WERE MORE

02:16:53.872 --> 02:16:55.540
EXPENSIVE IN THE LABS WERE MORE

02:16:55.607 --> 02:16:56.541
EXPENSIVE.

02:16:56.608 --> 02:16:57.409
BUT I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT

02:16:57.475 --> 02:16:58.443
INSTRUCTION ONLY RELATED

02:16:58.510 --> 02:17:00.378
ACTIVITIES WERE LIKE THINGS LIKE

02:17:00.445 --> 02:17:02.380
CLASSES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO

02:17:02.447 --> 02:17:03.748
I'M A LITTLE PUZZLED BY THAT

02:17:03.815 --> 02:17:05.584
ALSO I'M DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THE

02:17:05.650 --> 02:17:07.052
REAL HIGH COST OF HEALTH

02:17:07.118 --> 02:17:09.054
SERVICES BUT ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT

02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:10.789
I AM IN A HEALTH MANPOWER

02:17:10.855 --> 02:17:12.357
SHORTAGE AREA AND THAT.

02:17:12.424 --> 02:17:14.192
IS A WHOLE NOTHER ISSUE WHICH WE

02:17:14.259 --> 02:17:17.429
COULD TALK ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME --

02:17:17.495 --> 02:17:19.564
SO -- I THINK ONE OF THE

02:17:19.631 --> 02:17:21.099
CHALLENGES THAT WE WE KEEP

02:17:21.166 --> 02:17:22.534
HEARING I KEEP HEARING FROM MY

02:17:22.601 --> 02:17:23.401
STUDENTS.

02:17:23.468 --> 02:17:25.403
IN MY IN MY FROM HUMBOLDT STATE

02:17:25.470 --> 02:17:27.072
UNIVERSITY IN PARTICULAR IS THAT

02:17:27.138 --> 02:17:28.506
IT IS REALLY REALLY EXPENSIVE TO

02:17:28.573 --> 02:17:29.608
GO TO SCHOOL THERE AND PEOPLE

02:17:29.674 --> 02:17:31.042
THINK BECAUSE IT'S A SMALL

02:17:31.109 --> 02:17:32.444
UNIVERSITY.

02:17:32.510 --> 02:17:34.079
IN A RURAL AREA IT WOULDN'T BE

02:17:34.145 --> 02:17:35.246
BUT IT'S NOT.

02:17:35.313 --> 02:17:36.581
THERE EVERYTHING IS HIGHER

02:17:36.648 --> 02:17:38.216
TRANSPORTATION COSTS ARE HIGHER

02:17:38.283 --> 02:17:40.852
FOOD IS HIGHER RENT CAN BE HIGH

02:17:40.919 --> 02:17:43.221
GASOLINE IS HIGH AND SO THE SUIT

02:17:43.288 --> 02:17:44.656
STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING.

02:17:44.723 --> 02:17:46.191
SO PART IS WHAT I LIKE THIS

02:17:46.257 --> 02:17:48.259
MAKES ME FEEL A LITTLE BIT LIKE

02:17:48.326 --> 02:17:49.728
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE AIRLINES

02:17:49.794 --> 02:17:52.931
WERE YOU GOT TO PAY FOR YOUR

02:17:52.998 --> 02:17:53.498
BAGS.

02:17:53.565 --> 02:17:54.432
YOUR YOU YOU KNOW YOU GET

02:17:54.499 --> 02:17:55.533
PEANUTS BUT YOU GOT TO BY ANY

02:17:55.600 --> 02:18:00.005

HAVING DIFFICULTY.

02:27:20.097 --> 02:27:20.865
UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENCE

02:27:20.932 --> 02:27:22.934

CERTAINLY COULD COULD BE FOR

02:27:46.090 --> 02:27:47.558
SURE -- I THINK ONE OF THE

02:27:47.625 --> 02:27:48.593
CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE

02:27:48.659 --> 02:27:50.494
EXPERIENCED OVER THE YEARS IS

02:27:50.561 --> 02:27:53.197
THAT -- WHEN WHEN GENERAL FUND

ELEVEN HUNDRED TWELVE HUNDRED

02:28:18.122 --> 02:28:19.190

CAMPUS.

02:30:04.528 --> 02:30:06.364
FIRST ONE THE EARLIEST ONE THAT

02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:24.248

02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:39.196
SUBSET OF THE MATERIAL SERVICES

02:30:39.263 --> 02:30:41.732

02:30:52.843 --> 02:30:54.278
LOOKED AT AND WITHIN THE AUDIT

02:30:54.345 --> 02:30:55.646

SOME OF THEM MAY OR MAY NOT BE

02:30:56.881 --> 02:30:59.283

ONE FEE AND A LITTLE BIT MORE IN

02:31:01.085 --> 02:31:03.120

THAT ARE GOING SOMEWHERE WHICH

02:33:37.608 --> 02:33:38.776
IS OBVIOUSLY WHY WE'RE GOING TO

02:33:38.842 --> 02:33:43.213
DO THIS AUDIT -- FEDERAL LAW

02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:45.215

WEBSITE YOU'LL SEE -- THE FEES

02:34:00.864 --> 02:34:01.332
LAID OUT FOR THAT SPECIFIC

02:34:01.398 --> 02:34:02.132
CAMPUS.

02:34:02.199 --> 02:34:03.601

OVERSIGHT ABOUT THAT THIS IS

02:34:14.678 --> 02:34:18.649
THESE ARE REASONABLE -- OR THE I

02:34:18.716 --> 02:34:20.050

02:34:20.117 --> 02:34:22.820
REVIEW BUT IT IT FEELS LIKE.

02:34:22.886 --> 02:34:25.556
CAMPUSES.

02:34:25.623 --> 02:34:27.224
ARE PRETTY AUTONOMOUS.

02:34:27.291 --> 02:34:29.226
YEAH EACH YEAR IS RYAN INDICATED

02:34:29.293 --> 02:34:31.629
WE COLLECT THIS INFORMATION --

02:34:31.695 --> 02:34:33.430
BOTH AFTER THE FEE HAS BEEN PASS

02:34:33.497 --> 02:34:36.033
BUT ALSO WHILE EACH INDIVIDUAL

02:34:36.100 --> 02:34:37.801

TRUSTEES ANNUALLY.

02:34:41.605 --> 02:34:43.707

02:34:50.347 --> 02:34:51.582
INSTITUTIONS.

02:34:51.649 --> 02:34:53.884
SO IS THERE NO EFFORTS USE -- TO

02:34:53.951 --> 02:34:56.186
USE THE BUYING POWER OF TWENTY

02:34:56.253 --> 02:34:57.821

BE OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE --

02:35:06.463 --> 02:35:07.898
THAT WERE UNIVERSITY COULD

02:48:27.730 --> 02:48:29.732
THERE IS AN ACCOUNTABILITY

02:48:29.799 --> 02:48:32.502

THAT IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY

02:48:56.659 --> 02:48:59.095
THERE'S NO BETTER WAY.

CONFUSION.

02:49:16.112 --> 02:49:18.014
STAMPS TO A MISUNDERSTANDING --

02:49:18.081 --> 02:49:20.149

THERE SEEMS TO BE.

02:49:30.693 --> 02:49:33.429
CONTINUED A CONFUSION AROUND THE

02:49:33.496 --> 02:49:35.465
DOCUMENTATION NECESSARY. TO GET

02:49:35.532 --> 02:49:38.067
THE REAL ID BUT WE HELD WITH THE

02:49:38.134 --> 02:49:39.702
DM THESE HELP LAST WEEK A WEEK

02:49:39.769 --> 02:49:43.706
BEFORE -- VERY WELL ATTENDED --

02:49:43.773 --> 02:49:46.976

FROM PEOPLE I HAVE A MILITARY ID

02:50:00.590 --> 02:50:01.858

AND SO.

02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:06.396
I THINK IT IS WE CAN STIPULATE

02:50:06.462 --> 02:50:07.597
THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT

02:50:07.664 --> 02:50:09.699
CONFUSION.

02:50:09.766 --> 02:50:12.001
AND I ALSO THINK THAT WE'VE GOT

02:50:12.068 --> 02:50:13.336

02:50:13.403 --> 02:50:15.338

INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALISM I WANT

02:50:21.945 --> 02:50:23.379
TO UNDERSCORE THIS.

02:50:23.446 --> 02:50:25.481
IT HASN'T BEEN BECAUSE WE ASK

02:50:25.548 --> 02:50:28.151
THE AUDITOR TO LOOK AT THE MOTOR

02:50:28.217 --> 02:50:28.918

02:50:35.725 --> 02:50:36.793
JOURNALISM.

02:50:36.859 --> 02:50:38.161
THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

NEW THAT THE MOTOR VOTER PROGRAM

02:51:50.099 --> 02:51:50.933
IMPORTANT.

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:52.669
THIS DEPARTMENT IS THE MOST

02:51:52.735 --> 02:51:55.371
PUBLIC FACING ENTITY IN THE

02:51:55.438 --> 02:51:57.373

THERE WAS GOING TO BE SOME

02:52:46.322 --> 02:52:48.124
ISSUES THAT NON CITIZENS WOULD

INCLUDING LAWFUL RESIDENTS WHO

EIGHT PROCESSING.

02:53:06.075 --> 02:53:08.644
ERROR WHEN WE REGISTER PEOPLE TO

02:53:11.380 --> 02:53:14.317
RELIABILITY THERE IS NO -- GRAY

02:53:14.383 --> 02:53:16.452
AREA WHEN IT COMES TO THE

02:53:16.519 --> 02:53:18.154
IMPORTANT FRANCHISE OF OF

AFTER MONTHS OF MISTAKES WE HAVE

02:53:34.537 --> 02:53:36.906
THOUSANDS OF EMBARRASSING ERRORS.

02:53:36.973 --> 02:53:38.975
WE BELIEVE IT IS TIME FOR

02:53:39.041 --> 02:53:41.611
NONPARTISAN INDEPENDENT AUDIT.

02:53:41.677 --> 02:53:43.980

A COMPREHENSIVE WORK PLAN.

AND IN THE HOT COMPREHENSIVE

03:03:54.189 --> 03:03:55.824
WORK PLAN WE HAVE IDENTIFIED

03:03:55.891 --> 03:03:56.959
WHEN I CALL KIND OF A WORKING

I AM A FIRM BELIEVER OF BEING

03:04:03.265 --> 03:04:04.533
KIND OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT --

03:04:04.600 --> 03:04:06.301
ELK AND ALSO ABOUT PERFORMANCE

03:04:06.368 --> 03:04:07.803
MUCH MANAGEMENT.

03:04:07.870 --> 03:04:09.471
IS THAT IF YOU DON'T ACTUALLY

03:04:09.538 --> 03:04:11.206
DOCUMENT YOU DON'T MEASURE IT

03:04:11.273 --> 03:04:12.775
OFTENTIMES DOESN'T GET DONE.

03:04:12.841 --> 03:04:14.576
AND SO IT WAS REALLY CLEAR TO ME

03:04:14.643 --> 03:04:15.344
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CLEARLY

03:04:15.411 --> 03:04:16.845
IDENTIFY ALL THAT NEED TO BE

03:04:16.912 --> 03:04:18.313

ALSO MAKE APPROPRIATE COURSE

03:04:21.517 --> 03:04:22.684
CORRECTIONS IF WE DETERMINE THE

03:04:22.751 --> 03:04:24.219
PATH WE WERE TAKING WAS NOT THE

03:04:24.286 --> 03:04:25.087
RIGHT PATH.

03:04:25.154 --> 03:04:26.088
THOSE ARE ALL IMPORTANT IN

03:04:26.155 --> 03:04:28.557
MAKING GOOD DECISIONS SO I FEEL

03:04:28.624 --> 03:04:29.191
BETWEEN THE CORRECTIVE ACTION

03:04:29.258 --> 03:04:30.259
PLAN.

03:04:30.325 --> 03:04:31.927
THE WORK PLAN AND THEN --

03:04:31.994 --> 03:04:33.328
DETERMINING WHAT THE ASSESSMENT

03:04:33.395 --> 03:04:35.297
IS FROM ERNST AND YOUNG -- WILL

03:04:35.364 --> 03:04:36.532
HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON THINGS WE

03:04:36.598 --> 03:04:37.866
NEED TO DO.

03:04:37.933 --> 03:04:40.269
THAT BEING SAID I DON'T DISMISS

03:04:40.335 --> 03:04:41.503
THE VALUE OF AN AUDIT I AM A

03:04:41.570 --> 03:04:42.738
KIND OF A CHAMPION FOR AUDITS

03:04:42.805 --> 03:04:44.239
AND APPRECIATE THE VALUE.

03:04:44.306 --> 03:04:45.841
I THINK THE TIMING OF IT IS

03:04:45.908 --> 03:04:47.709
PROBABLY WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT.

03:04:47.776 --> 03:04:49.378
IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO AT LEAST

03:04:49.445 --> 03:04:51.280
ALLOW THE TIME TO IMPLEMENT WHAT

03:04:51.346 --> 03:04:53.415
WE STARTEDTO ACTUALLY SEE THAT

03:04:53.482 --> 03:04:54.516
THERE'S BEEN SOME MARKET

03:04:54.583 --> 03:04:56.185
IMPROVEMENTS I WOULD TELL YOU

03:04:56.251 --> 03:04:57.719
SAID SHE JUST APPROVE THE BUDGET.

03:04:57.786 --> 03:04:59.188
WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE EVEN

03:04:59.254 --> 03:05:00.289
IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE THINGS

03:05:00.355 --> 03:05:01.523
THAT YOU'VE ALLOWED US TO GO

03:05:01.590 --> 03:05:03.759
AHEAD AND IMPLEMENT -- AND THEN

03:05:03.826 --> 03:05:05.661
THE SO YOUNG ASSESSMENT IS GOING

03:05:05.727 --> 03:05:06.261
TO BE INTERESTING BUT I WILL

03:05:06.328 --> 03:05:07.362
ASSURE YOU.

03:05:07.429 --> 03:05:09.031
THAT ON A WEEKLY BASIS WE ARE A

03:05:09.097 --> 03:05:10.365
CONSTANT CONVERSATION WITH THE

03:05:10.432 --> 03:05:12.601
SECRETARY OF STATE WITH REGARDS

03:05:12.668 --> 03:05:14.770
TO THE PROGRAMMATIC ASPECTS OF

03:05:14.837 --> 03:05:19.341
MOTOR VOTER -- AND IT'S ALSO

03:05:19.408 --> 03:05:19.908
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT.

03:05:19.975 --> 03:05:20.576
THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES

03:05:20.642 --> 03:05:21.910
SERVES AS AN ADMINISTRATOR FOR

03:05:21.977 --> 03:05:23.412
THE SECRETARY OF STATE.

03:05:23.479 --> 03:05:25.547
WE PROCESS THE INFORMATION

03:05:25.614 --> 03:05:27.149
MAKING THE DETERMINATION ON

03:05:27.216 --> 03:05:28.450
THOSE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE TO VOTE

03:05:28.517 --> 03:05:30.419
IN REGISTERING IN THE ROLES THAT

03:05:30.486 --> 03:05:31.954
STILL LIES WITH THE SECRETARY OF

03:05:32.020 --> 03:05:32.855
STATE.

03:05:32.921 --> 03:05:34.323
SO I THINK THAT'S ALSO PART WHEN

03:05:34.389 --> 03:05:35.858
YOU CONSIDER WHAT YOU'RE GOING

03:05:35.924 --> 03:05:37.960
TO BE EVALUATING.

03:05:38.026 --> 03:05:39.661
THANK YOU FROM.

03:05:39.728 --> 03:05:41.630
THE THE THE PROPOSED BUDGET

03:05:41.697 --> 03:05:44.132
ALLOCATION FOR NINETEEN TWENTY

03:05:44.199 --> 03:05:46.001
DOES THAT PROVIDE YOU SUFFICIENT

03:05:46.068 --> 03:05:48.904
RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT YEAR

03:05:48.971 --> 03:05:49.671
STRATEGIC.

03:05:49.738 --> 03:05:53.075
WORK PLAN.

03:05:53.141 --> 03:05:54.209
AT THIS POINT TIME BASED ON OUR

03:05:54.276 --> 03:05:56.345
ASSESSMENT AND TRYING TO ALSO BE

03:05:56.411 --> 03:05:58.046
EXTREMELY GOOD STEWARDS OF THE

03:05:58.113 --> 03:05:59.815
MONEY SO THE CALIFORNIANS WE

03:05:59.882 --> 03:06:02.017
BELIEVE IT DOES -- I THINK WHEN

03:06:02.084 --> 03:06:03.719
YOU LOOK AT THE VOLUME OF

03:06:03.785 --> 03:06:05.354
CALIFORNIANS THAT DO HAVE

03:06:05.420 --> 03:06:06.555
DRIVER'S LICENSE AND

03:06:06.622 --> 03:06:08.290
IDENTIFICATIONS AND THEY ONE OF

03:06:08.357 --> 03:06:10.125
THE LARGEST STATES TO GO AHEAD

03:06:10.192 --> 03:06:12.294
AND UNDERTAKE THIS OFFER -- IT

03:06:12.361 --> 03:06:13.795
IS A SIGNIFICANT AND I THINK AS

03:06:13.862 --> 03:06:15.597
I SAID EARLIER IT'S A STARK AN

03:06:15.664 --> 03:06:17.032
UNPRECEDENTED FOR THE CALIFORNIA

03:06:17.099 --> 03:06:18.400
FOR THE DMV.

03:06:18.467 --> 03:06:19.568
BUT I DO BELIEVE WE HAVE THE

03:06:19.635 --> 03:06:20.602
RESOURCES I THINK MORE

03:06:20.669 --> 03:06:22.371
IMPORTANTLY IT'S NOT JUST ONE

03:06:22.437 --> 03:06:23.872
SET OF THINGS WERE LOOKING OUT

03:06:23.939 --> 03:06:24.840
TO IMPROVE IT.

03:06:24.907 --> 03:06:26.375
IT'S HOW DO WE USE OUR WEBSITE

03:06:26.441 --> 03:06:28.243
IN A MORE EFFICIENT WAY IT'S HOW

03:06:28.310 --> 03:06:30.112
DO WE DEPLOY MORE CHAOS SO THAT

03:06:30.178 --> 03:06:31.947
WE CAN SERVE MORE PEOPLE THROUGH

03:06:32.014 --> 03:06:33.382
THE VEHICLE REGISTRATION PROCESS.

03:06:33.448 --> 03:06:34.883
HOW DO WE CREATE MORE CAPACITY

03:06:34.950 --> 03:06:36.685
THAN IN OUR FIELD OFFICES TO

03:06:36.752 --> 03:06:37.953
HANDLE THE DRIVER'S LICENSE AND

03:06:38.020 --> 03:06:39.454
IDENTIFICATION?

03:06:39.521 --> 03:06:40.889
PROCESSING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

03:06:40.956 --> 03:06:42.391
SO I THINK AT THIS POINT TIME WE

03:06:42.457 --> 03:06:44.092
FEEL CONFIDENT BUT I ALSO KNOW

03:06:44.159 --> 03:06:45.227
WILL BE REPORTING TO YOU ON A

03:06:45.294 --> 03:06:46.762
REGULAR BASIS.

03:06:46.828 --> 03:06:47.963
AND THE FUNDING YOU'VE GIVEN US

03:06:48.030 --> 03:06:49.364
IS FOR A TWO YEAR PERIOD OF TIME

03:06:49.431 --> 03:06:51.066
SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET IN.

03:06:51.133 --> 03:06:52.668
CONTINUE TO ASSESS HOW WE ARE

03:06:52.734 --> 03:06:55.003
APPROPRIATELY FORECASTED WHAT WE

03:06:55.070 --> 03:06:56.572
NEED HELP WE ARE PROBABLY

03:06:56.638 --> 03:06:58.874
FORECAST AT THE DEMAND -- AND

03:06:58.941 --> 03:07:00.876
HAVE WE ANTICIPATED THE POSITIVE

03:07:00.943 --> 03:07:02.244
RESULTS FROM THE OTHER THINGS

03:07:02.311 --> 03:07:02.878
THAT WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO BE

03:07:02.945 --> 03:07:05.314
DOING. TO HELP ADDRESS CUSTOMER

03:07:05.380 --> 03:07:06.748
NEEDS.

03:07:06.815 --> 03:07:10.385
THANK YOU -- SO [inaudible]

03:07:10.452 --> 03:07:12.421
AND YOU'VE SUGGESTED A

03:07:12.487 --> 03:07:15.357
WILLINGNESS TO COOPERATE SHOULD

03:07:15.424 --> 03:07:17.359
THERE BE A STATE ON IT BUT GIVEN

03:07:17.426 --> 03:07:19.161
WHAT YOU ARE SEEKING TO

03:07:19.227 --> 03:07:21.730
IMPLEMENT RIGHT NOW -- THE

03:07:21.797 --> 03:07:23.498
TIMING OF THAT ON IT I THINK YOU

03:07:23.565 --> 03:07:26.068
ALLUDED TO IT BUT WHAT IT DIVERT

03:07:26.134 --> 03:07:27.603
INTERNAL RESOURCES THAT WOULD

03:07:27.669 --> 03:07:30.138
IMPEDE YOUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE.

03:07:30.205 --> 03:07:35.744
CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED OBJECTIVES.

03:07:35.811 --> 03:07:37.646
WELL I THINK -- I CAN ASSURE YOU

03:07:37.713 --> 03:07:39.815
IN MY SHORT TENURE AT DMV --

03:07:39.881 --> 03:07:41.249
WITH A NUMBER OF AUDIT SICK IT

03:07:41.316 --> 03:07:43.652
DONE ON THE DMV I AM CONSTANTLY

03:07:43.719 --> 03:07:45.821
DIVERTING RESOURCES. TO SUPPORT

03:07:45.887 --> 03:07:48.323
THE AUDIT ACTIVITY -- THAT JUST

03:07:48.390 --> 03:07:49.891
COMES WITH THE TERRITORY SO BUT

03:07:49.958 --> 03:07:50.626
I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE

03:07:50.692 --> 03:07:52.561
RESOURCES WOULD BE BECAUSE THAT

03:07:52.628 --> 03:07:53.228
WOULD DEPEND ON THE SCOPE OF THE

03:07:53.295 --> 03:07:54.096
AUDIT.

03:07:54.162 --> 03:07:55.330
BUT THERE WOULD BE A DIVERSION

03:07:55.397 --> 03:07:56.632
OF RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE

03:07:56.698 --> 03:07:58.266
AUDIT ACTIVITY.

03:07:58.333 --> 03:08:01.436
INTO ASKED THAT ANOTHER WAY --

03:08:01.503 --> 03:08:03.138
WOULD IT BE MORE USEFUL. TO

03:08:03.205 --> 03:08:06.041
SERVING THE PUBLIC INTEREST. TO

03:08:06.108 --> 03:08:08.443
HAVE AN AUDIT THAT CAME.

03:08:08.510 --> 03:08:10.379
LATER AFTER THE RETURN OF THE

03:08:10.445 --> 03:08:11.980
ERNST AND YOUNG ON IT IN YOUR

03:08:12.047 --> 03:08:14.916
ABILITY TO PURSUE SOME OF THE

03:08:14.983 --> 03:08:17.719
CURRENTLY STATED A REFORM SENATE

03:08:17.786 --> 03:08:18.353
CHECKED OF STATE YOU'RE WORKING

03:08:18.420 --> 03:08:22.491
ON I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT -- I

03:08:22.557 --> 03:08:25.761
I THINK IT WOULD ALLOW US TIME.

03:08:25.827 --> 03:08:27.162
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CITY

03:08:27.229 --> 03:08:29.364
YOUNG FOLKS HAVE IDENTIFIED AS

03:08:29.431 --> 03:08:30.032
SOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD BE

03:08:30.098 --> 03:08:32.167
MADE -- AND AGAIN IT'S IT'S

03:08:32.234 --> 03:08:33.435
THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

03:08:33.502 --> 03:08:34.903
SECRETARY OF STATE THAT WE'D BE

03:08:34.970 --> 03:08:36.138
LOOKING AT IMPROVEMENTS THAT

03:08:36.204 --> 03:08:38.073
COULD BE MADE -- BUT I THINK

03:08:38.140 --> 03:08:42.110
IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO MAYBE --

03:08:42.177 --> 03:08:44.379
OVER AUDIT OR OVER ANALYZED --

03:08:44.446 --> 03:08:45.514
TO I THINK WE NEED ALLOW SOME

03:08:45.580 --> 03:08:46.948
THINGS TO HAPPEN IN TO

03:08:47.015 --> 03:08:48.784
MATERIALIZE TO LET US UNDERSTAND

03:08:48.850 --> 03:08:49.985
WHAT IT MEANS FOR US.

03:08:50.052 --> 03:08:51.053
I THINK PROGRAM MEDICALLY

03:08:51.119 --> 03:08:52.554
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE VESTED

03:08:52.621 --> 03:08:55.490
IN DMV DOING REALLY REALLY WELL --

03:08:55.557 --> 03:08:57.392
INCLUDING MYSELF IN THE GOVERNOR

03:08:57.459 --> 03:08:59.027
ON THE GOVERNOR'S STRIKE TEAM.

03:08:59.094 --> 03:09:00.362
AND I THINK WE LIKE A CHANCE TO

03:09:00.429 --> 03:09:02.130
REALLY TRULY IMPLEMENT SOME OF

03:09:02.197 --> 03:09:03.031
THESE THINGS WE BELIEVE WILL

03:09:03.098 --> 03:09:04.399
MAKE A DIFFERENCE BUT I

03:09:04.466 --> 03:09:06.268
CERTAINLY DON'T DISMISS.

03:12:32.540 --> 03:12:34.576
HOPEFULLY A FEW MONTHS -- TO

03:12:34.643 --> 03:12:37.078
DEAL WITH SOME MORE OF THESE --

03:12:37.145 --> 03:12:40.048

THE RIGHT TIME TO DO SO FROM A

03:13:01.303 --> 03:13:02.804
PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE I THINK WE

03:13:02.871 --> 03:13:04.005

SOME OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS

03:16:15.730 --> 03:16:17.232
WITH AN IN DEPTH LOOK.

03:16:17.298 --> 03:16:19.601
AT HOW WE GET TO IMPROVING DMV

03:16:19.667 --> 03:16:21.202
FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS.

03:16:21.269 --> 03:16:22.370
RIGHT WE KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN

03:16:22.437 --> 03:16:24.105
DOCUMENTED INSTANCES THAT I'VE

03:16:24.172 --> 03:16:25.073
BEEN.

03:16:25.140 --> 03:16:27.408
ACROSS NUMEROUS HEADLINES AND A

03:16:27.475 --> 03:16:29.144
NUMBER OF NEWS REPORTS -- WE

03:16:29.210 --> 03:16:31.279
HEAR IT ANECDOTALLY FROM OUR

03:16:31.346 --> 03:16:33.515
CONSTITUENTS BACK HOME -- YOU

03:16:33.581 --> 03:16:34.883

03:16:37.218 --> 03:16:38.153
FOR OVER EIGHT HOURS.

03:16:38.219 --> 03:16:40.121
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS WE WANT TO

03:16:40.188 --> 03:16:41.756
TRY TO FIX DMV FOR ALL

03:16:41.823 --> 03:16:43.558

03:16:45.593 --> 03:16:47.829
DIRECTION WE SEE THIS AS BEING A

03:16:47.896 --> 03:16:49.497
PART OF THE SOLUTION NOT A

03:16:49.564 --> 03:16:50.932
HURDLE.

03:16:50.999 --> 03:16:53.201
IN ANY SENSE OF THE WORD BUT

03:16:53.268 --> 03:16:53.902
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO

03:16:53.968 --> 03:16:55.570
COLLECTIVELY WITH ALL OUR STATE

03:16:55.637 --> 03:16:57.472

AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

03:16:58.940 --> 03:17:00.441

PATTERSON HAD ADDITIONAL

03:17:02.043 --> 03:17:07.448

03:17:08.883 --> 03:17:10.351
MANNER IN WHICH WE ARE

03:17:10.418 --> 03:17:11.886
APPROACHING THIS.

03:17:11.953 --> 03:17:14.556
IS TO PRECISELY DELAY THIS TO

03:17:14.622 --> 03:17:17.725
THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE ERNST

03:17:17.792 --> 03:17:19.794

03:29:04.131 --> 03:29:06.100
THE JG CPA IS A VITAL INVESTMENT

03:29:06.166 --> 03:29:06.867
FOR THE STATE BUT COUNTY

03:29:06.934 --> 03:29:08.402

MAJORITY OF JJ CPA DOLLARS ARE

03:29:24.518 --> 03:29:25.886

FURTHER CRIMINALIZE YOUTH RATHER

03:29:43.404 --> 03:29:44.171

03:36:06.920 --> 03:36:08.955
STATE WIDE DATA SYSTEMS FOR

JUVENILE JUSTICE STATEWIDE DATA

03:36:26.006 --> 03:36:27.374
SYSTEM MIGHT LOOK LIKE.

03:36:27.441 --> 03:36:30.711
THERE WERE COMPROMISES MADE.

03:36:30.777 --> 03:36:31.712
AND A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN

03:36:31.778 --> 03:36:33.280

03:36:33.347 --> 03:36:36.216
STATE ABOUT HOW THE JJ DATA

WHICH IS ANOTHER RELATED GRANT

03:36:44.624 --> 03:36:46.426
HERE -- AND EVEN THOUGH WE SAY

03:36:46.493 --> 03:36:47.594

03:36:53.400 --> 03:36:55.102
SO ANYHOW WHAT THE MAIN POINT

03:36:55.168 --> 03:36:56.837
THAT I WANT TO SAY HERE TODAY IS

03:36:56.903 --> 03:37:00.374

SO MISTER CHAIRMAN ONE OF THE

03:47:37.577 --> 03:47:39.379

WHERE DAD IS CONCERNED THERE

03:53:23.756 --> 03:53:24.657
AGAIN THERE'S VERY VERY LIMITED

03:53:24.724 --> 03:53:26.992

03:53:33.566 --> 03:53:35.067
USED THE GAME THE AS IT WAS

WHICH IS VERY VERY ALARMING AND

03:53:49.849 --> 03:53:52.318
DISHEARTENING -- I THINK WHAT'S

03:53:52.385 --> 03:53:53.953
GOING ON IN LA IS EXACTLY WHEN

03:59:56.749 --> 03:59:58.150
DECLINES IN BOTH ARREST AND

03:59:58.217 --> 04:00:01.487
DETENTION -- DIVERSION IS A VERY

04:00:01.553 --> 04:00:02.821
MUCH A FOCAL POINT OF PROBATION

04:00:02.888 --> 04:00:04.022
AND SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW IS A

04:00:04.089 --> 04:00:05.791
IS A GROWING FOCUS AND SO WHEN

04:00:05.858 --> 04:00:06.859
WE LOOK AT THE SYSTEM THERE

04:00:06.925 --> 04:00:09.261
SIGNIFICANT DATA TO SHOW THAT --

04:00:09.328 --> 04:00:11.196
BOTH THE WITH WITH JJ CPA AND

04:00:11.263 --> 04:00:12.498
OTHER FUNDING SOURCES THAT THERE

04:00:12.564 --> 04:00:13.832
HAVE BEEN.

04:00:13.899 --> 04:00:15.100
SIGNIFICANT ADVANCEMENTS THAT

04:00:15.167 --> 04:00:16.902
CONTINUE TO BE MADE AND I I JUST

04:00:16.969 --> 04:00:18.437
DON'T WANT THAT POINT TO BE LOST

04:00:18.504 --> 04:00:19.938
AND THAT THIS IS IT GETTING TO

04:00:20.005 --> 04:00:21.774
THE RIGHT EFFECTIVE APPROACHES --

04:00:21.840 --> 04:00:22.808
WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT IS

04:00:22.875 --> 04:00:24.443
THAT IS THAT COMMITTEES DESIRE

04:00:24.510 --> 04:00:25.944
TO TO LOOK AT THESE THINGS --

04:00:26.011 --> 04:00:27.012
BUT WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE WAY

04:00:27.079 --> 04:00:28.147
THE SCOPE IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED

04:00:28.213 --> 04:00:29.681
THAT IT MAY NOT CAPTURE ALL OF

04:00:29.748 --> 04:00:31.216
THE PIECES THAT -- WE THINK BOTH

04:00:31.283 --> 04:00:32.351
THE AUTHOR WOULD BE INTERESTED

04:00:32.417 --> 04:00:33.852
IN THE LEGISLATURE BE INTERESTED

04:00:33.919 --> 04:00:34.987
IN OR THAT REALLY PAINTS THE

04:00:35.053 --> 04:00:36.889
FULL PICTURE -- OF THE TYPES OF

04:00:36.955 --> 04:00:38.757
PROGRAMMING THAT IS HAPPENING SO

04:00:38.824 --> 04:00:40.526
IF YOU THINGS I WOULD -- NOTE --

04:00:40.592 --> 04:00:41.393
THE ANNUAL REPORT AS WE

04:00:41.460 --> 04:00:42.494
MENTIONED THERE IS ANNUAL

04:00:42.561 --> 04:00:44.196
REPORTING THAT IS HAPPENING --

04:00:44.263 --> 04:00:45.330
AND SO WE THINK THAT THAT IS

04:00:45.397 --> 04:00:46.999
SOMETHING THAT -- IS ALREADY IN

04:00:47.065 --> 04:00:48.934
MANY WAYS CAPTURED WITHIN THAT

04:00:49.001 --> 04:00:50.169
THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT --

04:00:50.235 --> 04:00:51.436
REGARDING THE TIMELINE IT DOES

04:00:51.503 --> 04:00:54.373
MENTION -- UP UNTIL.

04:00:54.439 --> 04:00:54.907
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN I THINK

04:00:54.973 --> 04:00:56.475
INCLUDING EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS

04:00:56.542 --> 04:00:57.376
IMPORTANT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

04:00:57.442 --> 04:00:58.944
HAPPEN YEAR OVER YEAR AND SO NOT

04:00:59.011 --> 04:01:00.779
HAVING THAT LAST YEAR IN THIS

04:01:00.846 --> 04:01:02.848
COULD MISS SOME SOME VALUABLE

04:01:02.915 --> 04:01:04.750
INSIGHTS -- THE REQUESTEDTHIS

04:01:04.817 --> 04:01:06.084
IS ON ONE PARTICULAR FUNDING

04:01:06.151 --> 04:01:07.619
SOURCES AND AS WE KNOW BECAUSE

04:01:07.686 --> 04:01:08.654
THESE AREN'T FUSIONS AND A LOCAL

04:01:08.720 --> 04:01:09.855
SYSTEM AND THERE'S BLENDING OF

04:01:09.922 --> 04:01:13.992
SOURCES AND AND FIGURING OUT HOW

04:01:14.059 --> 04:01:15.027
BEST TO A RE SOURCE THE LOCAL

04:01:15.093 --> 04:01:15.360
COMMUNITIES.

04:01:15.427 --> 04:01:15.961
THAT AGAIN IT MAY NOT PAY THE

04:01:16.028 --> 04:01:16.795
FULL PICTURE FOR LOOKING AT ONE

04:01:16.862 --> 04:01:19.097
SPECIFIC SOURCE FOR ONE SPECIFIC

04:01:19.164 --> 04:01:21.033
PURPOSE -- THE ONE OTHER THING

04:01:21.099 --> 04:01:22.267
WE WOULD ENCOURAGE JUST OUT

04:01:22.334 --> 04:01:24.102
COMMITTEE IS TO LOOK AT OTHER

04:01:24.169 --> 04:01:25.604
METRICS THAT MAY BE IMPORTANT.

04:01:25.671 --> 04:01:27.005
ON THE PHONE THE FOCUS IN MANY

04:01:27.072 --> 04:01:28.407
WAYS SEEMS TO BE ON WHERE THE

04:01:28.473 --> 04:01:29.641
DOLLARS ARE GOING INTO TO WHICH

04:01:29.708 --> 04:01:31.243
ENTITIES -- BUT THAT DOESN'T

04:01:31.310 --> 04:01:32.678
NECESSARILY GET OUT QUALITY OF

04:01:32.744 --> 04:01:34.546
SERVICES OUTCOMES FOR YOUTH AND

04:01:34.613 --> 04:01:35.814
OTHER IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT WE

04:01:35.881 --> 04:01:37.216
THINK AGAIN ARE PART OF MAKING

04:01:37.282 --> 04:01:38.317
SURE WE'RE DOING.

04:01:38.383 --> 04:01:39.618
THE RIGHT THINGS THAT WE ALL

04:01:39.685 --> 04:01:40.219
WANT TO SEE HAPPENING INTHIS

04:01:40.285 --> 04:01:42.321
REGARD -- AND THEN THOUGH THE

04:01:42.387 --> 04:01:43.355
ONE OTHER POINT I WOULD SAY IS

04:01:43.422 --> 04:01:44.756
THAT -- I THINK THERE'S BEEN A

04:01:44.823 --> 04:01:46.792
DISCUSSION ON THIS BEING A GRANT

04:01:46.859 --> 04:01:48.327
PROCESS WITH KIND OF

04:01:48.393 --> 04:01:51.029
SOLICITATIONS AND AND GRANTEES

04:01:51.096 --> 04:01:52.364
AGAIN THIS WAS NOT DESIGNS

04:01:52.431 --> 04:01:54.333
NECESSARILY IN THAT FASHION THIS

04:01:54.399 --> 04:01:56.134
WAS DESIGNED AS AS THAT HAS BEEN

04:01:56.201 --> 04:01:58.170
DISCUSSED WITH THE LOCAL JJ CC.

04:01:58.237 --> 04:01:59.738
ON TO DEVELOP THAT PLAN AND THEN

04:01:59.805 --> 04:02:01.340
IMPLEMENT FROM THERE AND SO WE

04:02:01.406 --> 04:02:02.307
THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT

04:02:02.374 --> 04:02:03.742
THAT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS MAY

04:02:03.809 --> 04:02:05.377
NOT COMPLETELY COMPORT WITH I

04:02:05.444 --> 04:02:07.145
THINK HOW -- THE PROGRAM WAS

04:02:07.212 --> 04:02:08.447
DESIGNED IN AND DOLLARS ARE

04:02:08.513 --> 04:02:10.215
FLOWING SO -- WITH THAT WE

04:02:10.282 --> 04:02:10.916
APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION

04:02:10.983 --> 04:02:12.117
CERTAINLY GLAD TO BE PART OF IT

04:02:12.184 --> 04:02:13.518
I THINK WE WENT ON CERTAINLY ASK

04:02:13.585 --> 04:02:14.686
AND HOPE THAT THERE'S

04:02:14.753 --> 04:02:16.188
CONSIDERATION BY THIS COMMITTEE

04:02:16.255 --> 04:02:17.890
TO HAVE MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT

04:02:17.956 --> 04:02:19.658
THE SCOPE OF THE AUDIT -- IF IT

04:02:19.725 --> 04:02:20.759
IS TO MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE SURE

04:02:20.826 --> 04:02:21.627
WE CAN DO ALL THE THINGS THAT

04:02:21.693 --> 04:02:24.930
ARE DESIRED BY THIS COMMITTEE

04:02:24.997 --> 04:02:25.964
AND THE LEGISLATURE THANK YOU.

04:02:26.031 --> 04:02:26.999

04:02:40.679 --> 04:02:42.381
THIS ISSUE MATTERS TO ME BECAUSE

04:02:42.447 --> 04:02:44.283
MY EXPERIENCE BEING ON PROBATION

04:02:44.349 --> 04:02:46.118

SIXTEEN OPUS EIGHT SCENE WAS A

04:02:47.452 --> 04:02:48.921
VERY HUMILIATING EXPERIENCE.

DURING THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS ON

ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT THE

04:03:08.640 --> 04:03:10.876

YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE HOW THEY

04:03:16.515 --> 04:03:17.182
SPEND IT.

04:03:17.249 --> 04:03:18.917

MORE MONEY INTO PROBATION WE

04:03:25.157 --> 04:03:26.425

LOITERING -- AND BEING ON

SOMETHING THAT I NEVER SAW UP

PROBATION OFFICER PULLING UP TO

OUR YOUTH DOES NOT MAKE IN OUR

FUTURE ALL UP GROW AND BE BETTER.

04:04:18.477 --> 04:04:19.778
THAT'S ACTUALLY HOLDING US BACK

04:04:19.845 --> 04:04:21.413

OVERSIGHT.

04:04:42.034 --> 04:04:43.502

THERE WOULD BE NOBODY.

04:04:49.775 --> 04:04:51.276
THERE WOULD BE NO OVERSIGHT TO

04:04:51.343 --> 04:04:52.811
WOULD BE NO DISCUSSION ABOUT

04:04:52.878 --> 04:04:55.347
WHAT'S GOING ON THAT'S THE

04:04:55.414 --> 04:04:56.615
BEAUTY OF THE INTELLIGENCE OF

04:04:56.681 --> 04:04:58.483
THE ELECTORATE TO GIVE US TWELVE

04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:59.184

LOOK AT THINGS AND IS LISTEN TO

04:05:03.288 --> 04:05:04.723
SOME OF THE DISCUSSION AND THE

04:05:04.790 --> 04:05:07.092
WISDOM OF THE COUNTY. TO TO STOP

04:05:07.159 --> 04:05:10.162
A PROGRAM THAT WAS NOT

04:05:10.228 --> 04:05:12.030
FUNCTIONING -- FOR FOR MAYBE

04:05:12.097 --> 04:05:13.665
TWENTY OR TEN YEARS IF THEY HAD

04:05:13.732 --> 04:05:16.968
ONGOING OVERSIGHT LIKE THIS IT

04:05:17.035 --> 04:05:18.070
MAY HAVE BEEN CAUGHT SOONER.

04:05:18.136 --> 04:05:20.672
AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT

04:05:20.739 --> 04:05:22.340
THE TO HAVE THIS OVERSIGHT MY

04:05:22.407 --> 04:05:24.176
INTENT.

04:05:24.242 --> 04:05:25.911
IS TO SH TO HIGHLIGHT.

04:05:25.977 --> 04:05:26.745
THE GOOD THINGS THAT ARE

04:05:26.812 --> 04:05:28.213
HAPPENING AND THE THINGS THAT

04:05:28.280 --> 04:05:30.315
NEED IMPROVEMENT I DON'T SAY BAD

04:05:30.382 --> 04:05:31.149
ADJUSTED THINGS THAT NEED

04:05:31.216 --> 04:05:33.051
IMPROVEMENT TRY TO FIGURE THAT

04:05:33.118 --> 04:05:36.421
OUT -- ANY REASON IT'S SO

04:05:36.488 --> 04:05:37.823
IMPORTANT WE DO IT NOW.

04:05:37.889 --> 04:05:38.723
AND WITH THE JUVENILE JUSTICE

04:05:38.790 --> 04:05:41.159
SYSTEM IT BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR

04:05:41.226 --> 04:05:42.994
OF THIS STATE.

04:05:43.061 --> 04:05:44.329
