ATTITUDE WHERE WE ARE REACH FOR

00:59:08.511 --> 00:59:10.513

00:59:12.215 --> 00:59:13.683
SADLY THAT SOME OF THESE FOLKS

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:14.717
ARE GOING TO DO.

00:59:14.784 --> 00:59:16.419
IS TRY TO WALK AWAY FROM A

00:59:16.486 --> 00:59:18.755

ONE BUT THINK ABOUT THE

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:26.923
THOUSANDS EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:29.592
DO THE RIGHT THING WITH THAT I

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:30.193
SUPPORT THIS BILL NOT URGENT I

01:00:30.259 --> 01:00:32.228
VOTE.

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:33.529
THANK YOU SEN ARCHULETA CENTER

THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.135
RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL --

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:40.803
FOR SEVERAL REASONS I THINK IT'S

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:42.505
OBVIOUSLY CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:43.473
THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO

01:00:43.539 --> 01:00:45.174
BEAR ARMS BUT AND I UNDERSTAND

01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:46.142
MY COLLEAGUE FROM SANTA

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:48.311
BARBARA'S ARGUMENT ABOUT HAVING

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:49.712
TO FIRE ARMS ON CAMPUS.

01:00:49.779 --> 01:00:52.348
BUT I I ADDRESS THE THE DOUGLAS

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:54.017
OF THE SYSTEM AND DOUGLAS HIGH

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:55.118
SCHOOL ISSUE.

01:00:55.184 --> 01:00:56.085
AND THE REASON WHY I SAY THAT IS

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:57.553
BECAUSE THEY HAD ARMED PEOPLE

01:00:57.620 --> 01:00:58.888
AVAILABLE THERE.

01:00:58.955 --> 01:01:01.190
BUT WHEN YOU'RE IN A SITUATION

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:03.559
WHERE SOMEONE IS FIRING FIRING

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:03.993
AT YOU.

01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.929

TO DEFEND YOU ARE SAVE YOU IS --

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:15.505
SECONDS COUNT AND FOR THOSE

01:01:15.571 --> 01:01:17.073
PEOPLE TO GET TO AT THAT VERY

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:17.840
MOMENT.

01:01:17.907 --> 01:01:20.443
AND THE PEOPLE OF A SMALL NARROW

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:22.412
GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT THIS BILL

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:24.380
ACTUALLY AUTHORIZES ARE PEOPLE

01:01:24.447 --> 01:01:26.849
THAT ARE TRAINED THEY'RE MOST

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:28.117
LIKELY POST CERTIFIED.

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:30.653
SO THEY HAVE THE TRAINING NEEDED

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.823
IN ORDER TO ENGAGE PROPERLY WITH --

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.158
INDIVIDUALS IN CASE SOMETHING

01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:37.460
HAPPENS AND TO RESTRICT THEM

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:38.795
FROM BEING ABLE NOT TO HAVE A

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:41.064
CCW AND RESTRICT THEM FROM NOT

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:42.231
CARRYING ON CAMPUSES.

01:01:42.298 --> 01:01:43.599
YOU KNOW ONE DAY THESE

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:44.634
INDIVIDUALS THAT REALLY CARE

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.636
ABOUT THE STUDENTS WHICH MOST

01:01:46.702 --> 01:01:48.438
EVERYBODY CARES ABOUT OTHER

01:01:48.504 --> 01:01:49.072
STUDENTS.

01:01:49.138 --> 01:01:50.339
THEY'LL BE THE PERSON THAT

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:52.075
PROTECTS THEM BETWEEN LIFE AND

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:54.010

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:58.181
DOUGLAS HIGH SCHOOL.

01:01:58.247 --> 01:02:00.083
THE P. E. TEACHER THE DIM THE

01:02:00.149 --> 01:02:03.486
GYM TEACHER USED HIS BODY. TO

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:06.422
BLOCK BULLETS BEING FIRED AT THE

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:08.691
STUDENTS SO THAT THE STUDENTS

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:11.360
WOULD BE SAFE DOWN A HALLWAY

01:02:11.427 --> 01:02:13.796
THAT P. E. TEACHER SAVED MANY

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:15.231
STUDENTS LIVES.

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:17.066

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:20.336
FOR THAT P. E. TEACHER TO HAVE

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:21.604
GONE THROUGH A PRO CERTIFICATION

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:23.439
A CCW CLASS.

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:25.508
AND WHEN IN A LESS ACTIVE ENGAGE

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:27.110
SHOOTER WAS TRYING TO TAKE HIS

01:02:27.176 --> 01:02:29.112
LIFE AND HIS STUDENTS LIFE I

01:02:29.178 --> 01:02:30.646
WOULD HAVE LOVED FOR THAT P.

01:02:30.713 --> 01:02:31.547
TEACHER TO BE ABLE TO DEFEND

01:02:31.614 --> 01:02:33.049
HIMSELF IN A STUDENTS.

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:34.517
AND STILL BE ALIVE HERE TODAY

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:35.518

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:37.286
SO I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR AND I

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:38.554
APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR ALSO

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:40.490
MAKING IT VERY NARROW AND NOT

01:02:40.556 --> 01:02:42.258
BROAD SO THAT THIS IS SOMETHING

01:02:42.325 --> 01:02:45.161
THAT WE COULD ADDRESSED.

01:02:45.228 --> 01:02:46.963
IN A COLLEGIAL MANNER THANK YOU.

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:48.231

YES SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO

01:02:50.099 --> 01:02:53.302
CORRECT -- IF I IF I MISSTATED

01:02:53.369 --> 01:02:55.004
TO THE GOOD SENATOR FROM

01:02:55.071 --> 01:02:56.539
BAKERSFIELD I'M NOT TALKING

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:59.075
ABOUT ON DUTY POLICE OFFICERS

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:00.510
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT CAMPUS --

01:03:00.576 --> 01:03:03.579
ISSUES I'M TALKING ABOUT RETIRED

01:03:03.646 --> 01:03:05.314
OFF DUTY POLICE.

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:07.517
UC POLICE OFFICERS BEING GIVEN

01:03:07.583 --> 01:03:08.851
THE RIGHT TO CARRY CONCEALED

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:10.286
WEAPONS WITH THEM.

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:12.855
AFTER THEY RETIRED ANYWHERE THEY

01:03:12.922 --> 01:03:16.359
CHOOSE TO GO SO MY CONCERN IS.

01:03:16.425 --> 01:03:18.127
THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH WE HAVE

01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:20.163
ENOUGH PROBLEMS -- WHEN WE HAVE

01:03:20.229 --> 01:03:21.531
PEOPLE CARRYING CONCEALED

01:03:21.597 --> 01:03:24.100
WEAPONS AND I THINK OF INSTANCES

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:25.835
WHERE WITH ALL THE BEST OF

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:28.404
INTENTIONS THE USE OF FIREARMS

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:30.006
ESCALATING SITUATIONS

01:03:30.072 --> 01:03:32.141
UNNECESSARILY WHICH HAPPENED AT

01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:33.976
THE SITUATION AND COSTCO WHICH

01:03:34.043 --> 01:03:35.311
HAS HAPPENED IN OTHER PLACES?

01:03:35.378 --> 01:03:37.513
ALSO WHEN YOU USE FIREARMS THE

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.815
RISK ASSOCIATED FOR EXAMPLE AT

01:03:39.882 --> 01:03:41.951
THE BORDERLINE INCIDENT WHEN IT

01:03:42.018 --> 01:03:44.320
WAS INDEED A C. H. P. BULLET.

01:03:44.387 --> 01:03:46.489
THAT KILLED THE VENTURA COUNTY

01:03:46.556 --> 01:03:48.791
DEPUTY SHERIFF WE HAVE TO ASK

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:50.726
OURSELVES ISN'T THERE A BETTER

01:03:50.793 --> 01:03:51.561
WAY.

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:53.896
AND CERTAINLY TO EXPAND

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:56.265
CONCEALED WEAPON KERRY TOP OFF

01:03:56.332 --> 01:03:57.800
DUTY RETIRED.

01:03:57.867 --> 01:04:00.303
POLICE OFFICERS IS NOT A AN

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:01.304
ATTEMPT.

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:03.139
TO MERGE THEIR GOOD WORK WHEN

01:04:03.206 --> 01:04:04.974
THEY WERE ON DUTY BUT IT ASKS

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:06.976
THE QUESTION DO WE REALLY WANT

01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:08.511
TO BE SEEING MORE AND MORE

01:04:08.578 --> 01:04:09.545
FIREARMS.

01:04:09.612 --> 01:04:11.581
IN PUBLIC PLACES AND WHAT IF WE

01:04:11.647 --> 01:04:13.149
DO WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE AND

01:04:13.216 --> 01:04:15.451
MORE INSTANCES LIKE WE SAW THIS

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:17.787
COSCO JUST A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

01:04:17.853 --> 01:04:19.255
AND I FOR ONE DON'T BELIEVE THE

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:21.090
SECOND AMENDMENT ENCOURAGES THAT

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:22.625
OR PERMITS THAT.

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:23.926
I THINK IT'S A MATTER OF COMMON

01:04:23.993 --> 01:04:26.429
SENSE WE NEED TO START REDUCING

01:04:26.495 --> 01:04:28.097
DE ESCALATING ALL THE

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:29.999
HOSTILITIES THAT WE ARE SEEING

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:31.133
IN TODAY'S WORLD.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.238
AND THAT IS THE REASON THAT I

01:04:35.304 --> 01:04:36.372
OPPOSE THIS BILL.

01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:37.740
THANK YOU CENTER JACKSON CENTER

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:38.174

I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS

01:04:39.442 --> 01:04:40.109
BILL I THINK THAT TODAY WE'RE

01:04:40.176 --> 01:04:42.011
SEEING CONFLICT LIKE WE'VE NEVER

01:04:42.078 --> 01:04:43.479
EVER SEEN BEFORE.

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:45.514
AND OUR OFFICERS ARE EXPOSED TO

01:04:45.581 --> 01:04:47.717
A MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OF VIOLENCE.

01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:50.052
I WENT TO JUST NOW TO LOOK UP TO

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:52.521
TELL YOU ABOUT A BLAST OF LIKE

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:53.823
NINE GANG MEMBERS AND IN THE

01:04:53.889 --> 01:04:55.858
CITY OF STOCKTON A FEW DAYS AGO.

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:57.760
AND UP POPS AND IT'S SOMETHING

01:04:57.827 --> 01:04:59.729
WHERE WE HAD ANOTHER PERSON

01:04:59.795 --> 01:05:01.697
KILLED IN A SHOOTING LAST NIGHT

01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:03.899
OUR OFFICERS WHETHER THEY'RE

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:05.234
POLICE OFFICERS ARE SHERIFF'S OR

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:07.103
UNIVERSITY OFFICERS THEY ARE

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:08.537
PUTTING THEMSELVES.

01:05:08.604 --> 01:05:11.707
AT RISK AND THEY AFTER RETIRING

01:05:11.774 --> 01:05:13.175
ARE OUT IN THE COMMUNITY AND

01:05:13.242 --> 01:05:14.710
THEY SEE PEOPLE THAT THEY HAVE

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:16.946
ARRESTED OR OR THAT THEY HAVE.

01:05:17.013 --> 01:05:18.748
OF CONFRONTED WHO ARE DOING

01:05:18.814 --> 01:05:21.017
THINGS AGAINST THE LAW AND THEY

01:05:21.083 --> 01:05:22.451
ARE AT RISK WHEN THEY DO SO AND

01:05:22.518 --> 01:05:24.320
I ALSO SAY THIS AS SOMEONE WHO

01:05:24.387 --> 01:05:26.155
LOST MY GODFATHER.

01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:27.890
A RETIRED POLICE OFFICER HE WAS

01:05:27.957 --> 01:05:30.159
STABBED TO DEATH A FEW YEARS AGO

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:32.295
AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE NOT

01:05:32.361 --> 01:05:33.963
FORGOTTEN HE SPENT MANY YEARS IN

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:35.431
THE COMMUNITY OF RESTING.

01:05:35.498 --> 01:05:37.400
A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS AND IT'S

01:05:37.466 --> 01:05:39.035
LIKELY THAT YOU RAN INTO

01:05:39.101 --> 01:05:40.503
SOMEBODY WHO HE HAD ONCE

01:05:40.569 --> 01:05:43.005
ARRESTED AND HE DIED OF VERY

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:44.507
DIALING VIOLENT DEATH.

VERY NARROW.

01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:34.156
AND TO TO REALLY RECOGNIZE THAT

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:35.891
JUST BECAUSE OUR POLICE OFFICERS

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:38.127
