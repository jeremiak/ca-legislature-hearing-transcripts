THEIR SYSTEMS. THERE HAVE BEEN

00:21:13.171 --> 00:21:14.840
SEVERAL PROPOSALS THAT HAVE

00:21:14.906 --> 00:21:16.341
BEEN MADE IN TERMS OF

00:21:16.408 --> 00:21:18.543
PRIORITIZING THE HARDENING OF

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:19.845
CERTAIN SUBSTATIONS ARE

00:21:19.911 --> 00:21:21.446
PRIORITIZING IN TERMS OF

00:21:21.513 --> 00:21:23.048
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:25.917
SYSTEMS. MOST OF THE BACK UP

00:21:25.984 --> 00:21:27.953
THAT THEY WILL BE HAVING- THIS

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.856
COMING WELFARE SEASON WILL BE

00:21:30.922 --> 00:21:32.524
AT DIESEL GENERATION AND IT

00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:34.493
WILL BE TEMPORARY. THEY ARE

00:21:34.559 --> 00:21:36.928
PLANNING LONGER TERM TO HAVE-

00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:40.332
RENEWABLE. BACKUP GENERATION-

00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:42.734
AND IN MY GRADES BUT THAT IS

00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:45.337
GOING TO TAKE A BIT LONGER. AND

WE I AS I SAID I WAS VERY

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:49.708
CONCERNED UNTIL MARCH BUT I DO

00:21:49.775 --> 00:21:54.146
BELIEVE IN THE CASE OF. ON PGA

00:21:54.212 --> 00:22:00.819
ANY THEY HAVE QUICKER. BEAR

00:22:00.886 --> 00:22:05.457
PREP. ANYWAY OR WHETHER STATE

00:22:06.091 --> 00:22:08.660
GETTING TO YES YES BOTH BEFORE

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:13.899
AND AFTER THEY HAVE. ALSO ADDED

00:22:13.965 --> 00:22:15.934
CAMERAS TO THEIR SYSTEM THEY'VE

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:16.868
ADDED SOME MORE ANALYTICAL

00:22:16.935 --> 00:22:19.504
ABILITIES SIMILAR TO SAN DIEGO

00:22:19.571 --> 00:22:21.139
GAS ELECTRIC IN TERMS OF

00:22:21.206 --> 00:22:22.708
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE

00:22:22.774 --> 00:22:25.844
PREDICTIVE NATURE OF FIRES AND-

00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:28.647
WEATHER IS. SO THAT IS A

00:22:28.714 --> 00:22:30.515
HELPFUL ALL THREE OF THE I. O.

00:22:30.582 --> 00:22:33.051

THEN THE LAST WILL BE AUGUST BY

00:22:41.893 --> 00:22:45.330
SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC SO SORRY

00:22:45.397 --> 00:22:46.631
TO BE LONG WINDED- THERE'S

00:22:46.698 --> 00:22:47.799
ACTUALLY EVEN MORE THAT WE'VE

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:50.202
DONE BUT THAT GIVES YOU SENATOR

00:22:50.268 --> 00:22:52.904
A LITTLE BIT OF AN OVERSIGHT

00:22:52.971 --> 00:22:54.106
HOW. CRITICALLY WE HAVE BEEN

00:22:54.172 --> 00:22:56.708
WORKING CLOSELY WE HAVE BEEN

00:22:56.775 --> 00:23:00.879
WORKING AND HAVING OVERSIGHT OF

00:23:00.946 --> 00:23:03.281
THE P. S. TS PREPARATIONS. YEAH

00:23:03.348 --> 00:23:05.450
THAT THING FOR THAT ANSWER VERY

00:23:05.517 --> 00:23:07.285
MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING

00:23:07.352 --> 00:23:10.388
RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATORS.

00:23:10.455 --> 00:23:12.958
RING A FIRE SEASON I GOT A CALL

00:23:13.024 --> 00:23:15.494
FROM AN EIGHTY TWO YEAR OLD

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.329
WILL TEAR DOWN VETERAN. WHO'S

ON OXYGEN HAS POWER TURNED OFF

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:22.701
AND ASSEMBLYMAN LACKEY AND I

00:23:22.768 --> 00:23:24.736
RENTED A GENERATOR WENT TO HIS

00:23:24.803 --> 00:23:26.638
HOUSE AND SET IT UP AND SETTING

00:23:26.705 --> 00:23:28.907
UP THESE DIESEL GENERATOR

00:23:28.974 --> 00:23:30.408
OUTSIDE WITH FIRES ALL AROUND

00:23:30.475 --> 00:23:31.810
IT MAKES IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO

00:23:31.877 --> 00:23:33.912
SENSE SO. I KNOW WE'VE GOT

00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:35.013
WE'RE GOING TO TRANSITION OUT

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.782
OF THAT BUT THAT'S GOOD THEY

00:23:36.848 --> 00:23:38.450
WERE MOVING THAT DIRECTION. I

00:23:38.517 --> 00:23:41.186
ALSO HAVE TO- CCA'S IN MY

00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:43.255
DISTRICT. AND THEY HAVE

00:23:43.321 --> 00:23:44.956
CONSIDER CONCERNS IN TERMS OR

00:23:45.023 --> 00:23:46.458
TRANSPARENCIES FROM FROM THE

00:23:46.525 --> 00:23:49.628
AUDIO USE. THIS IS A IS ARGUE

00:23:49.694 --> 00:23:51.429
THAT VERY DIFFICULT TO GET ANY

00:23:51.496 --> 00:23:52.864
INFORMATION AND OFTEN WHEN THEY

00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:54.733
DO THEY DON'T GET IT IN TIME

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.202
FOR THE NECESSARY IT ODDITY. IN

00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:58.537
THESE ERROR ERRORS IN THEIR

00:23:58.603 --> 00:23:59.938
OPINION HAVE SIGNIFICANT HAS

00:24:00.005 --> 00:24:01.673
CREATED SIGNIFICANT COST TO ALL

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.975
RATEPAYERS SO THE QUESTION IS

00:24:04.042 --> 00:24:05.644
WHAT EFFORTS WE TAKE TO

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:07.312
INCREASE TRANSPARENCY OF CALL

00:24:07.379 --> 00:24:09.281
GENERAL. SURGICALLY WITHIN THE

00:24:09.347 --> 00:24:11.850
CONTEXT OF THE ENERGY RESOURCES

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:46.134
SURE THAT BONE CONSTRUCTION

01:16:46.201 --> 01:16:49.237
SITES THAT WE STAGGER THE TIMES

01:16:49.304 --> 01:16:51.273
THAT PEOPLE TAKE BREAKS WHEN

NOT GATHERING TOGETHER. INTO

01:16:58.613 --> 01:17:01.249
ONE LOCATION. AT THE SAME TIME-

01:17:01.316 --> 01:17:04.319
