CARBONS AND SINISTER CORONADO

00:26:40.932 --> 00:26:42.634
AND BACK ON ONE CHARGE. RIGHT

00:26:42.701 --> 00:26:44.502
LIKE I CAN'T DO THAT ON MY AV SO

00:26:44.569 --> 00:26:45.136
WHEN WE'RE BUILDING OUT

00:26:45.203 --> 00:26:46.171
INFRASTRUCTURE YOU'RE BUILDING

00:26:46.237 --> 00:26:47.372
OUT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR MANY

00:26:47.439 --> 00:26:49.240
DIFFERENT TYPES OF BEHAVIOR BUT

00:26:49.307 --> 00:26:50.608
A MULTI FAMILY HOUSING WE'RE NOT

00:26:50.675 --> 00:26:52.110
SEEING THE MARKET BUILD AND LOW

00:26:52.177 --> 00:26:54.212
INCOME COMMUNITIES THEY'RE NOT

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:55.580
RETROFITTING WHEN THEY DO

00:26:55.647 --> 00:26:57.148
SUBSTANTIAL INNOVATIONS THAT'S

00:26:57.215 --> 00:26:59.050
JUST NOT HAPPENING AND MOST

00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:00.952
PEOPLE ARE AT HOME WHEN YOU LOOK

00:27:01.019 --> 00:27:03.088
AT THE TIME IT TAKES TO CHARGE I

00:27:03.154 --> 00:27:04.155
MEAN THERE'S ONE THING FOR FAST

00:27:04.222 --> 00:27:05.156
CHARGERS THAT SOLVES RANGE

00:27:05.223 --> 00:27:07.325
ANXIETY AND THEN ANOTHER THING

00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:09.027
OF IF I'M GONNA GO AND I'M GONNA

00:27:09.094 --> 00:27:10.929
BE USING MY EASY AS A COMMUTER

00:27:10.996 --> 00:27:12.263
VEHICLE. HOW AM I GETTING THAT

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:13.598
FIRST CHARGE SO I'M NOT STARTING

00:27:13.665 --> 00:27:15.166
MY DAY GOING YOU KNOW SPENDING

00:27:15.233 --> 00:27:17.769
AN HOUR CHARGING IT SOMEWHERE

00:27:17.836 --> 00:27:28.480
AND. SO I THINK THEY HAVE TO

00:27:28.546 --> 00:27:30.115
WORK TOGETHER BUT I DON'T THINK

00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:31.116
WE SOLVED EQUITY PER OF- EEVEE

00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:33.018
CHARGER IF WE DON'T HAVE A

00:27:33.084 --> 00:27:34.552
DEDICATED LINE I TO MULTI FAMILY

00:27:34.619 --> 00:27:35.687
LAW INCOME COMMUNITIES AGE NOT

00:27:35.754 --> 00:27:37.122
IN OFFICE THE UPTICK. AND I WILL

00:27:37.188 --> 00:27:39.257
I WANT TO DO IT EITHER FIVE

00:27:39.324 --> 00:27:41.726
THERE IT AND I TOLD AGREE WITH

00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:42.961
THAT I'M SORRY IF WE ALREADY TO

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:44.195
HAVE A LOT THAT WAS MY QUESTION

00:27:44.262 --> 00:27:46.297
IS THAT WE DO WE- HAVE A LINE

00:27:46.364 --> 00:27:47.899
ITEM I. IS OKAY THAT'S

00:27:47.966 --> 00:27:48.566
INTERESTED INCENTIVIZE. THE REST

00:27:48.633 --> 00:27:49.968
OF EXISTING MULTI FOR. OR WHEN

00:27:50.035 --> 00:27:52.170
YOU HAVE THE OUT OF AFFORDABLE

00:27:52.237 --> 00:27:53.071
UNITS. THE YOU KNOW I HAVE A

00:27:53.138 --> 00:27:54.139
DIFFERENT BILL THAT DEAL WITH

00:27:54.205 --> 00:27:56.074
THE WHAT DO YOU DO THE PLUMBING

00:27:56.141 --> 00:27:58.510
THE FULL TO. THAT THE DIFFERENT

00:27:58.576 --> 00:28:00.311
CON. DOWN AND THE KIND OF WORK

00:28:00.378 --> 00:28:01.613
TOGETHER AND THAT WAY IS HOW DO

00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:03.214
WE ACTUALLY GET. THE CHARGERS IN

00:28:03.281 --> 00:28:04.315
EIGHT WHERE WHERE PEOPLE NEED

00:28:04.382 --> 00:28:05.917
THEM. PEOPLE NEED THEM ALONG THE

00:28:05.984 --> 00:28:07.152
WAY BUT PEOPLE NEED THEM IN

00:28:07.218 --> 00:28:09.220
THEIR HOMES. WELL I CERTAINLY

00:28:09.287 --> 00:28:09.721
I'M CERTAINLY AGREE AND

OUT INFRASTRUCTURE THE

00:28:11.322 --> 00:28:12.690
INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE- I THINK

00:28:12.757 --> 00:28:13.892
WE CAN ALL RECOGNIZE WE'RE NEVER

00:28:13.958 --> 00:28:15.493
GOING TO. MEET OUR CLIMATE

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:16.928
OBJECTIVES ARE ZERO MISSION

00:28:16.995 --> 00:28:18.863
OBJECTIVES. WITHOUT THAT PIECE

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:30.575
OF THE PUZZLE. I JUST. HAD DID

00:28:30.642 --> 00:28:32.043
ANYBODY. THE JUST KIND OF A LONG

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:33.545
LINES THE NEW HOMES- NEW MULTI

00:28:33.611 --> 00:28:36.314
HOME ARE READY. US IN FIRST. TO

00:28:36.381 --> 00:28:38.049
FOR EVEY SO WHAT IT WOULDN'T A

00:28:38.116 --> 00:28:39.884
MORE IF TO JUST DIRECT TO-

00:28:39.951 --> 00:28:41.152
RETROFITS OF BUILDINGS IN THE

00:28:41.219 --> 00:28:42.821
LAW MY UNDERSTANDING OF CURRENT

00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:44.222
LAWS THE ONLY REQUIRE THE

00:28:44.289 --> 00:28:46.591
PLUMBING. FOR NEW EVEY IS NOT

00:28:46.658 --> 00:28:47.759
THE ACTUAL CHARGES THAT'S LIKE

00:28:47.826 --> 00:28:49.461
SAYING GIVE A PLUMBING FOR A

00:28:49.527 --> 00:28:51.062
TOILET IN THE HOUSE BUT YOU

00:28:51.129 --> 00:28:52.730
DON'T ACTUALLY PUT IN THE

00:28:52.797 --> 00:28:53.865
TOILET. THAT'S WHAT OUR CURRENT

00:28:53.932 --> 00:28:56.734
LAW DOES AND I HAVE A DIFFERENT

00:28:56.801 --> 00:28:58.303
BILL THAT ADDRESSES THAT. AND SO

00:28:58.369 --> 00:28:59.137
HOW DO YOU INCENTIVIZE THEM

00:28:59.204 --> 00:29:00.872
PUTTING IN BOTH THE PLUMBING AND

00:29:00.939 --> 00:29:02.807
THE TOILET SO ARE NOT ONLY DOING

00:29:02.874 --> 00:29:03.908
THE CAPACITY FOR THE CHARGER

00:29:03.975 --> 00:29:06.544
WHICH IS CURRENT LAW AND NEW A

00:29:06.611 --> 00:29:07.245
NEW UNITS BUT ACTUALLY THE

00:29:07.312 --> 00:29:07.846
CHARGES THEMSELVES OF THEM

00:29:07.912 --> 00:29:09.147
THEY'RE USEFUL. BECAUSE ALL AND

00:29:09.214 --> 00:29:11.349
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS AS A OUR

00:29:11.416 --> 00:29:13.351
COLLEAGUE SAID YOU'RE SEEING

THEY KNOW PEOPLE HAVE EV'S

00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:18.857
THAT'S A VALUE ADDED. ON IT TO

00:29:18.923 --> 00:29:20.558
THE PROJECT YOU'RE NOT SAYING IT

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:22.293
AND LOWER INCOME AND ONE THING

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.195
WE COULD CONSIDER IS JUST DOING

00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:26.264
RETROFITTING- MY CONCERN WOULD

00:29:26.331 --> 00:29:28.500

QUESTION THAT WOULD BE GREAT AND

00:29:37.308 --> 00:29:39.043
I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:41.579
AND AGAIN MY FIRST DAY HERE. OF

00:29:41.646 --> 00:29:48.520

TARGETED TO DO A GREAT PROGRAM.

00:29:50.054 --> 00:29:50.822
WE COULD CONSIDER THE GRANT

00:29:50.889 --> 00:29:52.457
PROGRAM I MEAN I UP WITH THAT

00:29:52.524 --> 00:29:53.925
CREDITS THAT'S WHAT I BUT THEY

00:29:53.992 --> 00:29:56.094
MIGHT BE OTHER WAYS TO DO IT IN

00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:58.129
A HAPPY TO EXPLOIT PEN WAS SIDE

COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU TO THE

00:30:46.778 --> 00:30:47.312
MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M

00:30:47.378 --> 00:30:50.114
PLEASED TODAY 2% A. B. NINETEEN

00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:51.316
ELEVEN WHICH WOULD CREATE A TAX

00:30:51.382 --> 00:30:52.116
CREDIT TO SUPPORT THE

00:30:52.183 --> 00:30:53.184
PRESERVATION OF TENS OF

00:30:53.251 --> 00:30:54.886
THOUSANDS OF AT RISK OF

00:30:54.953 --> 00:30:56.321
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN THIS

00:30:56.387 --> 00:30:58.623
BILL IS AIMED SQUARELY AT OUR

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.592
STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS WHICH-

00:31:00.658 --> 00:31:02.193
ALL OF US ARE VERY MUCH AWARE

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.661
OF. AND IT'S AIMED AT ADDRESSING

00:31:03.728 --> 00:31:05.163
A VERY SPECIFIC PROBLEM WHICH IS

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:06.231
THAT THERE ARE PROJECTIONS THAT

00:31:06.297 --> 00:31:08.066
OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS WE MAY

00:31:08.132 --> 00:31:10.335
LOSE BETWEEN THIRTY AND THIRTY

00:31:10.401 --> 00:31:11.569
FIVE THOUSAND UNITS OF DEED

00:31:11.636 --> 00:31:12.770
RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN

00:31:12.837 --> 00:31:14.038
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:31:14.105 --> 00:31:16.207
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE URGENCY TO

00:31:16.274 --> 00:31:17.675
BUILD A NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:31:17.742 --> 00:31:19.310
TO MEET OUR HOUSING CRISIS BUT

00:31:19.377 --> 00:31:21.312
THE IDEA THAT WE MIGHT LOSE

00:31:21.379 --> 00:31:22.480
THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND UNITS OR

00:31:22.547 --> 00:31:24.015
SOMETHING. OF TREMENDOUS CONCERN

00:31:24.082 --> 00:31:25.149
TO ME AND SO WITH THIS PROGRAM

00:31:25.216 --> 00:31:27.385
WOULD DO IS TO CREATE A TAX

00:31:27.452 --> 00:31:29.854
CREDIT MARKET INCENTIVES THAT

00:31:29.921 --> 00:31:31.789
WOULD INCENTIVIZE THE OWNERS OF

00:31:31.856 --> 00:31:32.890
THOSE BUILDINGS WERE DEED

00:31:32.957 --> 00:31:34.592
RESTRICTION OR SUBSIDY IS ABOUT

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:36.961
TO EXPIRE. TO SELL ABOUT

00:31:37.028 --> 00:31:38.429
BUILDING TO A MISSION DRIVEN

00:31:38.496 --> 00:31:40.031
NONPROFIT THEY COULD CONTINUE TO

00:31:40.098 --> 00:31:41.899
OPERATE THAT AS AFFORDABLE

00:31:41.966 --> 00:31:43.534
HOUSING IN THIS WOULD HAVE I

00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:45.370
THINK A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT

00:31:45.436 --> 00:31:46.404
BENEFITS FIRST OF ALL IT WOULD

00:31:46.471 --> 00:31:48.006
STABILIZE OUR SUPPLY OF

00:31:48.072 --> 00:31:49.374
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO HOPEFULLY

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.942
WE CAN BUILD ON THAT AND NOT

00:31:51.009 --> 00:31:52.143
GOING THE WRONG DIRECTION IT

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:53.611
WOULD PROTECT THOSE TENANTS WHO

00:31:53.678 --> 00:31:55.713
ARE AT RISK OF DISPLACEMENT. AND

00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.181
I ALSO THINK THAT IF WE WERE TO

00:31:57.248 --> 00:31:58.783
LOSE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND UNITS

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:00.418
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THINK

00:32:00.485 --> 00:32:01.986
ABOUT THAT IF THIRTY FIVE

00:32:02.053 --> 00:32:02.620
THOUSAND FAMILIES IN THE STATE

00:32:02.687 --> 00:32:03.921
OF CALIFORNIA WE WOKE UP ONE

00:32:03.988 --> 00:32:06.591
MORNING AND FOUND THAT THE RENTS

00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:07.225
WERE GOING TO DOUBLE OR TRIPLE

00:32:07.292 --> 00:32:08.593
OVERNIGHT I THINK THAT THAT

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:09.394
WOULD HAVE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.461
FAR STATES HOMELESSNESS CRISIS

00:32:10.528 --> 00:32:12.363
AND SO THIS IS A PROPOSAL OR WE

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:13.965
CAN RESERVE UNITS OF AFFORDABLE

00:32:14.032 --> 00:32:16.167
HOUSING FOR ABOUT TWENTY

00:32:16.234 --> 00:32:17.235
THOUSAND DOLLARS A UNIT YOU

00:32:17.302 --> 00:32:19.137
THINK ABOUT THE PRICES TO BUILD

00:32:19.203 --> 00:32:20.071
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN SOME OF

00:32:20.138 --> 00:32:21.539
OUR URBAN AREAS YOU'VE PROBABLY

00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:23.107
SEEN- AUDITS FROM THE CITY OF

00:32:23.174 --> 00:32:25.243
LOS ANGELES WHERE THEY CAN COST

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.711
SIX SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHT HUNDRED

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:27.278
K. A DOOR. RATHER THAN DOING

00:32:27.345 --> 00:32:29.380
THAT WE CAN PRESERVE UNITS FOR

00:32:29.447 --> 00:32:32.016
ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:32:32.083 --> 00:32:33.851
AND SO THIS WOULD CREATE A

00:32:33.918 --> 00:32:34.419
PROGRAM. WHERE WE WOULD- WE

00:32:34.485 --> 00:32:35.653
WOULD INVEST. FIVE HUNDRED

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.954
MILLION DOLLARS. THAT WOULD HELP

00:32:37.021 --> 00:32:39.757
US PRESERVE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE

00:32:39.824 --> 00:32:40.758
THOUSAND UNITS OF AFFORDABLE

00:32:40.825 --> 00:32:42.894
HOUSING. I'M REALLY PROUD THAT

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.395
THIS IS AN APPROACH THAT HAS.

00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:46.264
GARNERED BROAD SUPPORT FROM A

00:32:46.331 --> 00:32:47.665
LOT OF DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT

00:32:47.732 --> 00:32:48.433
AREN'T NECESSARILY ALIGNED SO

00:32:48.499 --> 00:32:50.435
YOU HAVE- TENDED IN EQUITY

00:32:50.501 --> 00:32:52.236
GROUPS ON THE SAME SIDE AS

OR QUESTIONS. FROM ASSEMBLY

00:40:57.588 --> 00:41:01.492
MEMBERS DR BURKE- SO ARE YOU

00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:03.060
FIRST OF ALL YOU SORT OF HAVE

00:41:03.127 --> 00:41:05.229
TWO PARTS TO THE BALLOT I'M NOT

00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:06.730
SURE THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY

00:41:06.797 --> 00:41:08.766
COMPATIBLE. BUT LET'S FIRST TALK

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:09.300
ABOUT THE DEED RESTRICTED

00:41:09.366 --> 00:41:13.204
PROPERTIES. ARM AGAIN HAVING

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:15.139
SERVED ON THE CITY COUNCIL I

00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:17.741
KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO KEEP

00:41:17.808 --> 00:41:18.209
THESE DEED RESTRICTED

00:41:18.275 --> 00:41:21.612
PROPERTIES. ARE GOING BUT NOT

00:41:21.679 --> 00:41:23.047
ALL OF THEM ARE CREATED EQUAL

00:41:23.113 --> 00:41:24.682
SOME OF THEM HAVE DONE

00:41:24.748 --> 00:41:25.316
REASONABLE MAINTENANCE OVER THE

00:41:25.382 --> 00:41:28.452
YEARS THERE WERE- SOMEONE TAKING

00:41:28.519 --> 00:41:30.621
OVER. OTHERS YOU'RE MORE

00:41:30.688 --> 00:41:32.923
QUESTIONABLE AND I'VE SEEN NON

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.759
PROFITS GET INTO PROBLEMS WHEN

00:41:35.826 --> 00:41:37.228
THEY'VE PURCHASED THE BUILDING

00:41:37.294 --> 00:41:38.729
AND THEN FIND OUT HALFWAY

00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:40.698
THROUGH THAT. THEY REALLY CAN'T

00:41:40.764 --> 00:41:43.701
MAKE IT WORK- I DON'T KNOW THAT

00:41:43.767 --> 00:41:46.036
THERE'S ANY SOLUTION TO THAT BUT

00:41:46.103 --> 00:41:48.038
IT'S SOMETHING. BASICALLY NOT

00:41:48.105 --> 00:41:50.274
ALL PROPERTIES CREATED EQUAL

00:41:50.341 --> 00:41:51.408
SOMETHING YOU MAY WANT TO THINK

00:41:51.475 --> 00:41:54.278
ABOUT. SECOND PART AGAIN THIS IS

00:41:54.345 --> 00:41:56.580
SO DIFFERENT IN AND PARTICULAR

00:41:56.647 --> 00:41:59.049
MOBILE HOME PARK SO HAYWARD HAS.

00:41:59.116 --> 00:42:00.084
NINE MOBILE HOME PARKS WHICH

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:03.053
REPRESENT- ARE REALLY AFFORDABLE

00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:06.624
HOUSING OTHER AREAS- MOBILE HOME

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.959
RENT CONTROL- PEOPLE ARE

00:42:09.026 --> 00:42:11.061
REQUIRED TO KEEP UP THE PARKS TO

00:42:11.128 --> 00:42:13.631
A CERTAIN LEVEL. THEY'RE ALSO

00:42:13.697 --> 00:42:15.833
WE'VE ZONED IT SO THE ONLY THING

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.235
THAT YOU COULD PUT IN THIS AREA

00:42:18.302 --> 00:42:20.271
IS A MOBILE HOME PARK. FURTHER

00:42:20.337 --> 00:42:22.840
IF A NONPROFIT WERE TO BUY THE

00:42:22.907 --> 00:42:24.341
MOBILE HOME PARK AND WANTED TO

00:42:24.408 --> 00:42:27.011
PUT IN. IN OUR APARTMENT

00:42:27.077 --> 00:42:29.280
BUILDING. MOST OF THESE FOLKS

00:42:29.346 --> 00:42:33.617
ARE RETIRED- FIXED INCOME. IT

00:42:33.684 --> 00:42:35.219
WOULD BE A MAJOR DISRUPTION TO

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:36.921
THEIR LIVES SO I'M NOT QUITE

00:42:36.987 --> 00:42:38.889
SURE THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT

00:42:38.956 --> 00:42:40.157
THING TO DO. IN THAT

00:42:40.224 --> 00:42:42.226
CIRCUMSTANCE SO THOSE ARE ALL

00:42:42.293 --> 00:42:44.061
THINGS TO THINK ABOUT AS TIME

00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:45.963
GOES ON I DON'T EXPECT YOU WOULD

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:47.464
HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE ANSWER

00:42:47.531 --> 00:42:50.100
RIGHT THIS MINUTE. I JUST AS YOU

00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:52.436
THINK AND IF YOU HAVE AN ANSWER

00:42:52.503 --> 00:42:53.504
THAT'S CERTAINLY WORTH THINKING

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.039
ABOUT BUT THOSE OF US. YOU KNOW

00:42:55.105 --> 00:42:56.273
TWO DIFFERENT CONCERNS THAT I

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.776
HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK

00:42:58.842 --> 00:43:00.911
YOU DR CORK AND ALL- OF- TRY TO

00:43:00.978 --> 00:43:02.146
ADDRESS YOUR THOUGHTFUL

00:43:02.212 --> 00:43:02.980
QUESTIONS QUICKLY THEN I'LL TURN

00:43:03.047 --> 00:43:05.716
IT OVER TO MR STIVERS WHO HAS

00:43:05.783 --> 00:43:06.317
THE REAL EXPERTISE HERE- BUT

00:43:06.383 --> 00:43:07.584
JUST ON THE SECOND POINT. SO

00:43:07.651 --> 00:43:09.219
THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT

00:43:09.286 --> 00:43:10.054
CONVERSION SO WHEN P. THAT

00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:11.288
SOMEBODY WOULD BUY A MOBILE HOME

00:43:11.355 --> 00:43:13.057
PARK AND THEN BUILD AN APARTMENT

00:43:13.123 --> 00:43:15.192
BUILDING THE IDEA HERE IS ABOUT

00:43:15.259 --> 00:43:16.360
PRESERVATION. OF EXISTING UNITS

00:43:16.427 --> 00:43:17.194
THE IDEA HERE IS ABOUT

00:43:17.261 --> 00:43:18.562
STABILIZING FAMILIES THAT LIVE

00:43:18.629 --> 00:43:20.164
IN THOSE CURRENT UNITS RIGHT TO

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:22.066
ME THE EXAMPLE THAT I THINK OF

00:43:22.132 --> 00:43:23.167
FOR THIS BILL. IS THERE'S A BIG

00:43:23.233 --> 00:43:24.468
YOU KNOW APARTMENT BUILDING

00:43:24.535 --> 00:43:25.703
SOMEWHERE THAT'S DEED RESTRICTED

00:43:25.769 --> 00:43:26.971
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THEN ALL

00:43:27.037 --> 00:43:29.606
OF A SUDDEN IT'S AT THE END OF

00:43:29.673 --> 00:43:30.174
THOSE FIFTY FIVE YEARS OR

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:31.942
WHATEVER IT MAY BE AND IT'S

00:43:32.009 --> 00:43:33.077
ABOUT TO BECOME MARKET RATE AND

00:43:33.143 --> 00:43:34.945
SO. THOSE TENANTS ARE RESCUED D.

00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:36.647
HERE IS TO CONVINCE THE OWNER OF

00:43:36.714 --> 00:43:37.214
THAT BUILDING RATHER THAN

00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:38.816
RAISING EVERYBODY'S RENTS TO

00:43:38.882 --> 00:43:39.883
MARKET RATES OR SELLING THAT

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.285
BUILDING TO SOMEBODY WHO'S GOING

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:43.020
TO OPERATE IT OR TEAR DOWN AS

00:43:43.087 --> 00:43:44.421
MARKET RATED. TO TRANSFER IT TO

00:43:44.488 --> 00:43:46.056
A YOU KNOW AT THAT MISSION

00:43:46.123 --> 00:43:47.424
DRIVEN NONPROFIT IN HAYWARD THAT

00:43:47.491 --> 00:43:48.292
WOULD CONTINUE TO OPERATE AS

00:43:48.359 --> 00:43:49.126
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO THOSE

00:43:49.193 --> 00:43:50.894
FOLKS WOULD BE STABLE I SO I.

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:52.229
ALL OF THE LAST MISTER SHRIVER'S

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:54.431
COMMA BUT I DON'T THINK WE NEED

00:43:54.498 --> 00:43:56.233
TO WORRY AS MUCH ABOUT THE

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.001
SECOND CONCERN- AND THEN ON THE

00:43:57.067 --> 00:43:59.236
FIRST OKAY NO I AGREE. IF YOU'RE

00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:01.005
IF IT HAS TO BE MAINTAINED HIS

00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:03.007
MOBILE HOME PARK THERE WAS JUST

00:44:03.073 --> 00:44:04.441
A QUESTION OF THE QUALITY OF THE

00:44:04.508 --> 00:44:06.143
DEVELOPMENT. AND SHOULD BE

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:09.213
GIVING THE TAX BREAK ON IN ALL

00:44:09.279 --> 00:44:10.280
CASES IN I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER

00:44:10.347 --> 00:44:12.149
TO THAT SO I GUESS WHAT I WOULD

00:44:12.216 --> 00:44:14.318
SAY THERE IS THAT- YOU KNOW

00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:15.185
THAT'S- BECAUSE THIS IS

00:44:15.252 --> 00:44:16.420
VOLUNTARY IT'S GOING TO BE A

00:44:16.487 --> 00:44:18.088
MARKET MECHANISM THAT'S GOING TO

00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:19.223
DRIVE IT. FIRST OF ALL YOU'D

00:44:19.289 --> 00:44:23.894
HAVE TO HAVE A NONPROFIT. THAT

00:44:23.961 --> 00:44:26.296
WOULD ONE ACQUIRED. PROPERTY

00:44:26.363 --> 00:44:27.097
THEY WOULD BE DOING A LOT OF.

00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:28.999
DEAL BUT ALSO THIS. THING IS

00:44:29.066 --> 00:44:30.834
TRUE. OF A BUYER THAT WOULD BE

00:44:30.901 --> 00:44:33.303
LOOKING TO OPERATE IT NOT. AS A

00:44:33.370 --> 00:44:34.338
AND NOT AS AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS

00:44:34.405 --> 00:44:34.938
MARKET RATE HOUSING NORMALLY

00:44:35.005 --> 00:44:36.240
THEY WOULD COME IN. THE

00:44:36.306 --> 00:44:38.042
UNWILLING TO BID ON THE BUILDING

00:44:38.108 --> 00:44:39.510
BECAUSE IT WAS MAINTAINED

00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:40.277
PROPERLY OR THERE WASN'T.

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:41.512
APPROPRIATE UPKEEP SO I DON'T

00:44:41.578 --> 00:44:42.746
KNOW IF MR CYBER AS ANYTHING.

00:44:42.813 --> 00:44:45.449
BUT I THINK TO ME THAT THE FACT

00:44:45.516 --> 00:44:47.818
THAT IT'S NOT AUTOMATIC THE FUND

00:44:47.885 --> 00:44:50.054
HAS TO BE A BUYER THAT WANTS TO

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.522
COME IN EITHER MARKET RATE FOR.

00:44:51.588 --> 00:44:53.290
OR IN THIS CASE TO GET THE TAX

00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:54.124
CREDIT- QUALIFIED NONPROFIT

00:44:54.191 --> 00:44:56.193
DEVELOPER- THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT

00:44:56.260 --> 00:44:58.896
GOING TO WANT TO BID ON A

00:44:58.962 --> 00:44:59.563
PROPERTY THAT SUB STANDARD. I'VE

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.865
JUST SEEN IT HAPPEN SO. BUT

00:45:01.932 --> 00:45:03.667
MAYBE THAT'S RARE IT MAY BE

00:45:03.734 --> 00:45:05.002
SOMETHING I SHOULDN'T BE WORRIED

00:45:05.069 --> 00:45:06.003
ABOUT THANKS FOR GOING I WOULD

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:08.105
ADD TO THAT IS THAT THEY THAT

00:45:08.172 --> 00:45:09.373
THE NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS HAVE.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.407
CHEN WE HAVE ACCESS TO RESOURCES

00:45:10.474 --> 00:45:12.142
INTO MARKET TELEVISION NOT TO DO

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:13.677
A REHABILITATION LIKE SOME TYPE

00:45:13.744 --> 00:45:15.412
OF SUBSIDY FROM THE CITY OR THE

00:45:15.479 --> 00:45:16.914
STATE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING SO.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:18.115
SOMETIMES THEY CAN ACTUALLY MAKE

00:45:18.182 --> 00:45:22.019
THAT WORK OR THE MARKET SIDE.

00:45:22.086 --> 00:45:23.120
CAN'T REALLY MAKE THAT WORK.

00:45:23.187 --> 00:45:26.523
THANK YOU. THIS PETRIE-NORRIS.

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:28.926
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- THANK

00:45:28.992 --> 00:45:30.294
YOU FOR BRINGING THAT MEASURE

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.763
FOR IT IS I THINK I'VE TOLD YOU

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.465
I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA

00:45:34.531 --> 00:45:35.132
I JUST I'M WONDER IF YOU COULD

00:45:35.199 --> 00:45:37.634
SPEAK TO THE POINT THAT WAS

00:45:37.701 --> 00:45:39.236
RAISED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS

00:45:39.303 --> 00:45:42.039
AROUND- THE FACT THAT KIND OF AS

00:45:42.106 --> 00:45:44.074
THIS IS STRUCTURED IT WOULD

00:45:44.141 --> 00:45:45.175
POTENTIALLY BE SUBSIDIZING

00:45:45.242 --> 00:45:47.811
MARKET RATE UNITS AND IS THERE

00:45:47.878 --> 00:45:50.013
ANY NOTHING THAT WE CAN DO OUR

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.315
WORK AROUND. THAT WE COULD

00:45:51.381 --> 00:45:54.651
INCLUDE TO MITIGATE THAT YEAH

00:45:54.718 --> 00:45:57.488
IT'S A VERY FAIR POINT- AND I

00:45:57.554 --> 00:45:58.422
APPRECIATE THE QUESTION AND I'LL

00:45:58.489 --> 00:46:00.991
ANSWER THEM ALLOW MR STIVERS TO

00:46:01.058 --> 00:46:03.727
CHIME IN HERE I FIRST WHAT MIGHT

00:46:03.794 --> 00:46:04.361
MY CONDITION AS I ASSUME THAT

00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:05.996
THIS IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE MY

00:46:06.063 --> 00:46:07.364
GUESS IS FEW AND FAR BETWEEN

00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:09.099
CASES WHERE YOU HAVE SOMEONE

00:46:09.166 --> 00:46:10.400
WHO'S WHO'S LIVING IN ONE OF

00:46:10.467 --> 00:46:11.568
THOSE UNITS AND AGAIN EVENTUALLY

00:46:11.635 --> 00:46:13.036
OVER TIME YOU'RE GOING TO

00:46:13.103 --> 00:46:15.606
CAPTURE A 100% OF THE UNITS- AND

00:46:15.672 --> 00:46:17.474
I GUESS THE OTHER THING I GOT

00:46:17.541 --> 00:46:19.009
IS. YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING TO DO

00:46:19.076 --> 00:46:20.811
THE BEST THAT WE CAN HER SO I

00:46:20.878 --> 00:46:22.012
WOULD RATHER TAKE A BUILDING

00:46:22.079 --> 00:46:24.114
HAVE NINETY OR 95% OR 89% OF

00:46:24.181 --> 00:46:25.349
THOSE UNITS PRESERVED AND MAY BE

00:46:25.415 --> 00:46:27.851
SUBSIDIZED ONE PERSON WHO WHO IS

00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:30.487
IN A LOW INCOME TENANT TO LIVE

00:46:30.554 --> 00:46:32.089
IN IT FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME

00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:33.423
THEN LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANY

00:46:33.490 --> 00:46:35.292
OF THOSE UNITS AND SO I THINK

00:46:35.359 --> 00:46:36.760
THAT'S JUST PART OF WHITE- WE'RE

00:46:36.827 --> 00:46:38.328
GONNA HAVE TO WORK YOUR **** MY

00:46:38.395 --> 00:46:39.363
HOPE AND EXPECTATION IS IT'S

00:46:39.429 --> 00:46:40.931
GOING TO BE RELATIVELY FEW AND

00:46:40.998 --> 00:46:42.733
FAR BETWEEN WHERE YOU HAVE THAT

00:46:42.799 --> 00:46:44.001
TYPE OF SITUATION ARISE I DON'T

00:46:44.067 --> 00:46:45.369
KNOW. MARK IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING

00:46:45.435 --> 00:46:47.070
YEAH JUST AT THE MARKET RATE

00:46:47.137 --> 00:46:49.339
UNITS WOULD STILL RENT IT IF THE

00:46:49.406 --> 00:46:50.574
PEOPLE ARE OVER INCOME THERE

00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:52.176
THEY WERE THEY WERE ABOVE THE

00:46:52.242 --> 00:46:53.443
LAW THE LOW INCOME RESTRICTION

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:54.111
IN THE BILL THEY WOULD CONTINUE

00:46:54.178 --> 00:46:56.013
TO PAY MARKET RENT SO THEY WOULD

00:46:56.079 --> 00:46:58.615
TURN OVER THE NORMAL WAY AND

00:46:58.682 --> 00:46:59.249
MOST MARKET RATE UNITS TURNED

00:46:59.316 --> 00:47:00.117
OVER ABOUT 42% PER YEAR SO IN

00:47:00.184 --> 00:47:01.318
THREE YEARS YOU'RE PROBABLY

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:03.086
GONNA GET TO A 100% AFFORDABLE

00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:04.188
DEVELOPMENT AND YOU HAVE FIFTY

00:47:04.254 --> 00:47:05.289
TWO MORE YEARS UNDER THE

00:47:05.355 --> 00:47:06.089
RESTRICTION WHICH IT'S

00:47:06.156 --> 00:47:07.224
AFFORDABLE. THE OTHER

00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:08.559
CONSIDERATION THERE IS THE

00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:11.128
ALTERNATIVE TO THE WAY THE BILL

00:47:11.195 --> 00:47:13.230
PROPOSES THAT IS IF THEY HAD TO

00:47:13.297 --> 00:47:14.298
ALL BE AFFORDABLE ON DAY ONE

00:47:14.364 --> 00:47:16.233
THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAKING TOO

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:17.100
MUCH MONEY WOULD HAVE TO BE

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:19.102
EVICTED AND WE'RE REALLY TRYING

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:20.070
TO PREVENT EVICTIONS HERE AND

00:47:20.137 --> 00:47:21.638
LET THE MARKET CURRENT TAKE ITS

00:47:21.705 --> 00:47:23.340
COURSE TURN THESE OVER OVER TIME

00:47:23.407 --> 00:47:24.074
BUT THAT SUCH A LONG DEED

00:47:24.141 --> 00:47:25.375
RESTRICTION THAT WE THINK

00:47:25.442 --> 00:47:29.079
THERE'S A LOT OF PUBLIC BENEFIT

00:47:29.146 --> 00:47:30.347
FOR A VERY SHORT TIME I'M WHERE

00:47:30.414 --> 00:47:32.149
FEW UNITS. WILL BE- MARKET RATE.

00:47:32.216 --> 00:47:33.150
THANKS FOR. THAT THAT

00:47:33.217 --> 00:47:34.318
CLARIFICATION I THINK THAT'S

00:47:34.384 --> 00:47:35.786
IMPORTANT. NUMBER LIVING YEAH I

00:47:35.852 --> 00:47:37.955
THINK YOU SAW THAT ONE OF THE

00:47:38.021 --> 00:47:38.956
POINTS THAT YOU MADE IN THE

00:47:39.022 --> 00:47:40.190
PRESENTATION WAS THE- IT SHOULD

00:47:40.257 --> 00:47:41.825
DEED RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE ARE

00:47:41.892 --> 00:47:45.229
PRESENT IN THE CURRENT- HOUSING.

00:47:45.295 --> 00:47:47.864
ONE OF THE- ONE OF THE THINGS

00:47:47.931 --> 00:47:49.600
THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY BY PUBLIC

00:47:49.666 --> 00:47:51.635
AGENCY MARIN COUNTY IN

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:53.237
PARTICULAR IS TO BUY EXISTING

00:47:53.303 --> 00:47:56.840
HOUSING STOCK THAT COULD BE LOST

00:47:56.907 --> 00:47:58.575
I DON'T THINK THAT ANY OF THAT.

00:47:58.642 --> 00:48:00.444
WHAT IS DEED RESTRICTED BUT IT

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:02.279
WAS IF THEY DIDN'T PURCHASE IT

00:48:02.346 --> 00:48:03.480
TO PRESERVE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

00:48:03.547 --> 00:48:05.249
LOST IT TO THE POINT THAT YOU'RE

00:48:05.315 --> 00:48:07.084
TRYING TO MAKE- SO WHAT EXACTLY

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:09.019
IS THE DEED RESTRICTION

00:48:09.086 --> 00:48:10.554
REQUIREMENT. IN IN YOUR BILL

00:48:10.621 --> 00:48:12.489
THAT HAS TO BE PRE EXISTING FOR

00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:15.392
PEOPLE QUALIFY FOR THAT. SO THE

00:48:15.459 --> 00:48:17.194
IDEA HERE IS THAT IT'S BOTH A

00:48:17.261 --> 00:48:18.562
DEED RESTRICTED SUBSIDIZED

00:48:18.629 --> 00:48:19.963
AFFORDABLE HOUSING ANY I GUESS

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:21.164
WHAT WE REFER TO AS NATURALLY

00:48:21.231 --> 00:48:22.299
OCCURRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO

00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:24.501
SORT OF WHAT YOU EXACTLY WHAT

00:48:24.568 --> 00:48:26.703
YOU ARE MENTIONING- AND- WERE

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:27.804
THE ESTIMATES THAT THE

00:48:27.871 --> 00:48:28.939
CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP

00:48:29.006 --> 00:48:30.207
PUT OUT AGAIN MR STIVERS

00:48:30.274 --> 00:48:31.241
MENTIONED THIS IS THE ENTITY

00:48:31.308 --> 00:48:32.843
THAT WE AS THE LEGISLATURE

00:48:32.909 --> 00:48:34.077
CREATED. AND SAID GIVE US ADVICE

00:48:34.144 --> 00:48:35.646
ABOUT HOW TO DO AFFORDABLE

00:48:35.712 --> 00:48:36.246
HOUSING WHILE AND SO THEY'VE

00:48:36.313 --> 00:48:38.015
COME BACK AFTER TALKING TO

00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:39.116
MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND SAYING

00:48:39.182 --> 00:48:40.284
WE THINK THIS IS A REALLY

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.252
IMPORTANT IDEA. BUT IT'S LOOKING

00:48:42.319 --> 00:48:44.054
AT EXACTLY THAT AS WELL- SO I

00:48:44.121 --> 00:48:46.723
HAVE A- BUT- A COUPLE OF

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:48.925
QUESTIONS KIND OF- FOLLOWING

00:48:48.992 --> 00:48:51.194
ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK I GUESS

00:48:51.261 --> 00:48:52.396
FROM MY- LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:48:52.462 --> 00:48:54.464
EXPERIENCE. A LOT OF THE MOBILE

00:48:54.531 --> 00:48:55.866
HOME PARKS OBVIOUSLY THEY DO

00:48:55.932 --> 00:48:57.601
PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND-

00:48:57.668 --> 00:48:59.770
MUCH OF IT IS A- NATURALLY

00:48:59.836 --> 00:49:01.438
OCCURRING BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:02.639
OVER THE YEARS IS HE'S- OF

00:49:02.706 --> 00:49:04.441
MOBILE HOME PARKS FALLING INTO

00:49:04.508 --> 00:49:05.142
DISARRAY WHEN THEY'RE IN.

00:49:05.208 --> 00:49:07.210
PRIVATE HANDS. HOW WOULD YOU

00:49:07.277 --> 00:49:11.014
GUARANTEE. THAT THESE THESE

00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:12.082
PARKS ARE MAINTAINED OVER THE

00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:14.551
YEARS. WANT TO TAKE THAT MARK.

00:49:14.618 --> 00:49:16.219
I'M THE FIRST FOR THE NONPROFITS

00:49:16.286 --> 00:49:17.421
ARE MISSION ORIENTED IN THE

00:49:17.487 --> 00:49:18.855
GINNELLY WILL ONLY GET INVOLVED

00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:21.024
IN THESE IF THEY CAN. DO A GOOD

00:49:21.091 --> 00:49:22.392
JOB OF MAINTAINING GOOD SOLID

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:24.194
STABLE HOUSING FOR THE RESIDENTS

00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:25.595
BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE AS I

00:49:25.662 --> 00:49:26.596
MENTIONED THAT THE NONPROFITS

00:49:26.663 --> 00:49:29.066
HAVE- ABILITY ACCESS TO

00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:30.467
RESOURCES THAT THE OTHER MARKET

00:49:30.534 --> 00:49:32.669
PARTICIPANTS DO NOT SO- VERONICA

00:49:32.736 --> 00:49:34.137
BRADY WAS MENTIONING AT THE CITY

00:49:34.204 --> 00:49:35.339
WE HAVE THE MOBILE HOME PARK

00:49:35.405 --> 00:49:37.007
PURCHASE AND REHABILITATION

00:49:37.074 --> 00:49:38.608
PROGRAM. NONPROFIT TAX HAVE

00:49:38.675 --> 00:49:40.210
ACCESS TO STATE FUNDS TO DO

00:49:40.277 --> 00:49:41.578
REHABILITATION OF THOSE

00:49:41.645 --> 00:49:42.879
DEVELOPMENTS IF THEY ARE

00:49:42.946 --> 00:49:44.481
OCCUPIED BY LOWER INCOME

00:49:44.548 --> 00:49:46.717
RESIDENTS AND SO- THAT PLUS THE

00:49:46.783 --> 00:49:47.951
FACT THAT THE NONPROFITS AREN'T

00:49:48.018 --> 00:49:48.985
SORT OF TRYING TO MAXIMIZE

00:49:49.052 --> 00:49:50.520
PROFIT THEY'RE TRYING TO. YOU

00:49:50.587 --> 00:49:52.589
KNOW BE IN FOR THE LONG TERM AND

00:49:52.656 --> 00:49:53.957
PROVIDE STABLE HOUSING THIS IS

00:49:54.024 --> 00:49:55.058
FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE BUT NOT

00:49:55.125 --> 00:49:56.727
GENERATING A TON OF PROFIT.

00:49:56.793 --> 00:49:58.228
UNDER THOSE WE THINK THAT THAT

00:49:58.295 --> 00:49:59.863
THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:01.164
A LOT THESE PROPERTIES OVER TIME

00:50:01.231 --> 00:50:02.265
WHEN THERE'S ACTUALLY A

00:50:02.332 --> 00:50:04.401
COMMITMENT TO DO THAT IS THERE

00:50:04.468 --> 00:50:05.302
ANY WAY TO GUARANTEE THAT THE

00:50:05.369 --> 00:50:06.803
NONPROFIT DOES THAT WELL. I MEAN

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:08.739
H. ET WILL BE MONITORING WELL

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:09.806
THE TICKET I'M SORRY T. CAT

00:50:09.873 --> 00:50:10.974
COULD'VE MISTER THIS PROGRAM

00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:11.742
WOULD BE MONITORING THESE

00:50:11.808 --> 00:50:13.143
DEVELOPMENTS AND I USED TO RUN

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:14.277
THAT ORGANIZATION AND EVERY

00:50:14.344 --> 00:50:16.713
THREE YEARS WE WENT OUT TO EVERY

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:17.948
SITE IN THE STATE AND MAKE SURE

00:50:18.014 --> 00:50:19.282
THAT THEY WE DID A PHYSICAL

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:20.951
INSPECTION OF. SO TO THE EXTENT

00:50:21.017 --> 00:50:22.619
THAT. THAT WERE NOT OCCURRING-

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:23.520
YOU KNOW THERE WOULD BE

00:50:23.587 --> 00:50:27.023
CONSEQUENCES. TO THE OWNER AND-

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:29.126
IN ADDITION- IN THE MOBILE HOME

00:50:29.192 --> 00:50:30.060
CONTACTS THERE ARE BOTH THE

00:50:30.127 --> 00:50:32.062
STATE AND- SOMETIMES LOCAL

00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:32.729
GOVERNMENTS. THEY HAVE

00:50:32.796 --> 00:50:33.964
INSPECTION PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:35.632
INDEPENDENT OF THAT THAT'S JUST

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:37.634
THEY DO IT OF ALL PARTS. OF

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:40.170
STATE FINANCED OR NOT SO- WE DO

00:50:40.237 --> 00:50:42.105
HAVE QUITE A BIT OF. WE HAVE

00:50:42.172 --> 00:50:43.874
QUITE A FEW TOOLS TO SORT OF

00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:45.842
DEAL WITH THAT BUT IN TERMS OF A

00:50:45.909 --> 00:50:47.043
GUARANTEED I MEAN IT'S HARD TO

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:48.145
SAY THAT. NOTHING WILL FALL

00:50:48.211 --> 00:50:50.781
THROUGH THE CRACKS EVER BUT WE

00:50:50.847 --> 00:50:51.715
HAVE QUITE A FEW SAFEGUARDS IN

00:50:51.782 --> 00:50:53.150
PLACE TO TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT

00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:54.217
THOSE PARTS ARE MAINTAINED OVER

00:50:54.284 --> 00:50:56.019
TIME. AND THE OTHER THING AGAIN

00:50:56.086 --> 00:50:57.053
FROM THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:58.054
PERSPECTIVE A LOT OF THESE

00:50:58.121 --> 00:51:00.690
MOBILE HOME PARKS ARE NOT I MEAN

00:51:00.757 --> 00:51:01.558
MOBILE HOMES ARE NOT COULD BE

00:51:01.625 --> 00:51:02.859
LASTING FIFTY FIVE YEARS. I

00:51:02.926 --> 00:51:04.127
MEAN. IF YOU'RE A LOT OF THE

00:51:04.194 --> 00:51:06.163
PARKS READY HAVE MOBILE HOMES

00:51:06.229 --> 00:51:07.597
THAT ARE. YOU KNOW HAVE HAD

00:51:07.664 --> 00:51:09.666
DECADES OLD. AND IT SEEMS THAT

00:51:09.733 --> 00:51:11.201
IN THE LONG RUN YOU MIGHT

00:51:11.268 --> 00:51:12.502
POTENTIALLY DISINCENTIVE ISING

00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:15.071
PUTTING PERMANENT. LOW INCOME

00:51:15.138 --> 00:51:18.708
HOUSING ON THESE LOTS. IF YOU IF

00:51:18.775 --> 00:51:20.210
YOU'VE LOCKED UP FOR FIFTY YEARS

00:51:20.277 --> 00:51:22.145
HOW WOULD YOU DEAL WITH THAT

00:51:22.212 --> 00:51:24.681
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THAT IN. THE

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:25.315
CITY THAT I WAS AND- YOU KNOW

00:51:25.382 --> 00:51:26.983
THERE WAS ALWAYS THE HOPE. THAT

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:29.119
YOU COULD TRANSITION PEOPLE INTO

00:51:29.186 --> 00:51:32.989
MORE PERMANENT- SAY FOR HOUSING.

00:51:33.056 --> 00:51:34.357
AND IF YOU'RE LOCKING UP THESE

00:51:34.424 --> 00:51:37.861
OLD MOBILE HOME PARKS FOR FIFTY

00:51:37.928 --> 00:51:39.396
FIVE YEARS. MIGHT NOT GET THERE

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:42.399
WELL SO THE OWNERS ROLE IN THIS

00:51:42.466 --> 00:51:45.368
IS TO PROVIDE THE SPACES RIGHT

00:51:45.435 --> 00:51:46.603
AND THEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:47.504
THE PARK IN THE COMMON

00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:49.105
FACILITIES IT IS THE HOMEOWNERS

00:51:49.172 --> 00:51:50.507
THE RESIDENTS ACTUALLY BRING THE

00:51:50.574 --> 00:51:52.776
HOME TO THE SITE AND SO- WE

00:51:52.843 --> 00:51:54.478
WOULD WE'D BE RELYING ON THE

00:51:54.544 --> 00:51:56.746
HOMEOWNERS TO. YOU KNOW MAINTAIN

00:51:56.813 --> 00:51:58.281
THEIR HOME AND OR UPGRADE THEIR

00:51:58.348 --> 00:52:00.217
HOME OVER TIME THAT DOES OCCUR

00:52:00.283 --> 00:52:01.451
BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT THIS M.

00:52:01.518 --> 00:52:03.186
PROP PROGRAM ANY CD THAT I

00:52:03.253 --> 00:52:04.654
MENTIONED BRIEFLY THEY DO HAVE

00:52:04.721 --> 00:52:06.389
FUNDS AS WELL FOR HOMEOWNERS IN

00:52:06.456 --> 00:52:08.191
THESE LOWER INCOME PARKS TO BE

00:52:08.258 --> 00:52:09.426
ABLE TO REPLACE THE HOMES ON

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:12.229
OCCASION SO- I THINK THAT. THAT

00:52:12.295 --> 00:52:14.431
WOULD BE THE WAY THAT WE WERE

00:52:14.498 --> 00:52:15.932
TRYING TO THAT IS THAT WE'RE

00:52:15.999 --> 00:52:16.900
TRYING TO KEEP THE MOBILE HOME

00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:18.602
PARKS OVER THE LONG TERM BUT

00:52:18.668 --> 00:52:20.103
UPGRADE THE HOUSING IN THE

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:21.304
MEANTIME BUT YOU DON'T SEE AT

00:52:21.371 --> 00:52:22.839
SOME POINT THAT IT MIGHT BE

00:52:22.906 --> 00:52:24.207
ADVANTAGEOUS IF THERE IS VERY

00:52:24.274 --> 00:52:25.308
LITTLE LAND LEFT IN A CERTAIN

00:52:25.375 --> 00:52:27.377
AREA THAT THIS MIGHT BE A PLACE

00:52:27.444 --> 00:52:28.545
TO BUILD A MORE PERMANENT-

00:52:28.612 --> 00:52:31.114
STRUCTURE. THAT THAT DOES

00:52:31.181 --> 00:52:33.850
HAPPEN- OPEN TO. HOW YOU WOULD

00:53:06.082 --> 00:53:07.250
ALWAYS IMAGINED IT IS SORT OF

IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATES

00:53:13.156 --> 00:53:14.090
THAT THAT MIGHT BE THE ONLY

00:53:14.157 --> 00:53:15.191
NATURAL. OCCURRING AFFORDABLE

00:53:15.258 --> 00:53:16.826

00:53:16.893 --> 00:53:18.528
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO THESE

00:53:18.595 --> 00:53:19.496

00:53:22.832 --> 00:53:24.167
OF THEM ARE OPERATING IN LARGE

00:53:24.234 --> 00:53:25.268

00:53:25.335 --> 00:53:27.070
TYPE OF MULTI FAMILY UNITS I

00:53:27.137 --> 00:53:27.938

HUNDRED TWENTY UNITS AFFORDABLE

00:53:36.179 --> 00:53:37.814
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO. IF

MOBILE HOME PIECE OF IT

00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:41.384
CERTAINLY HAPPY TO HAVE THAT

00:53:41.451 --> 00:53:42.252
CONVERSATION BECAUSE WHO

THE SELLER OF THE PROPERTY-

00:53:57.767 --> 00:53:59.803
TYPICALLY IF YOU'RE AN INVESTOR

00:53:59.869 --> 00:54:02.539
YOU WOULD TRY TO ROLL THAT INTO

00:54:02.606 --> 00:54:03.139
A FUTURE INVESTMENT- TO AVOID

00:54:03.206 --> 00:54:05.108
TAX IMPLICATIONS SO WITH THIS

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:07.310
ESSENTIALLY MEANS THAT THEY CAN

00:54:07.377 --> 00:54:08.979
STILL KEEP SOME OF THAT MONEY

00:54:09.045 --> 00:54:11.514
OUT OF THAT THAT- NEW INVESTMENT

00:54:11.581 --> 00:54:14.217
SO THAT THEY WOULD PAY A COUPLE

00:54:14.284 --> 00:54:15.051
GAINES ON WHAT PORTION THEY

00:54:15.118 --> 00:54:16.453

HERE WE THINK IT'S THE PERFECT

00:54:24.995 --> 00:54:26.997
TOOL TO USE HERE BECAUSE A LOT

00:54:27.063 --> 00:54:28.999
OF TIMES WHEN YOU HAVE A SELLER

00:54:29.065 --> 00:54:30.166
WHO'S GONNA SELL THAT BUILDING

THEY'RE GONNA DO A TEN THIRTY

00:54:31.234 --> 00:54:32.469
ONE RIGHT THEY'RE GONNA FLIP

00:54:32.535 --> 00:54:33.937
THAT TO AVOID TAX CONSEQUENCES

00:54:34.004 --> 00:54:35.372
INTO SOMETHING ELSE HERE AS MR

00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:37.140

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:39.009
LITTLE BIT OF ADEQUATE RIGHT AND

00:54:39.075 --> 00:54:40.110
SO BECOMES VERY VERY ATTRACTIVE

00:54:40.176 --> 00:54:41.444
AND IT ACTUALLY GIVES THE

00:54:41.511 --> 00:54:42.679
NONPROFIT A LEG UP OVER SOMEONE

00:54:42.746 --> 00:54:43.813

THEIR EXPERIENCES THAT THIS IS

WATER BENEFITS EVERYBODY RIGHT

01:07:26.475 --> 01:07:28.277
THIS IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL

01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:29.945
IS NOT TO PROVIDE A TAX REBATE

01:07:30.012 --> 01:07:31.113
TO- SOME HIGH INCOME FOLKS IT'S

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:33.115
TO HELP EVERYBODY IN THE STATE

01:07:33.182 --> 01:07:33.849
OF CALIFORNIA. AS WERE

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:34.884
ADDRESSING OUR WATER ISSUE AND

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:36.719
SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S TARGETED TO

01:07:36.786 --> 01:07:38.254
A SPECIFIC GROUP OF PEOPLE. THE

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.556
BENEFIT OF THIS BILL I THINK IS

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:42.057
VERY. IS VERY BROADLY TARGETED

01:07:42.124 --> 01:07:45.795
THANK YOU. I'M SO. HAPPY TO BE A

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:47.430
CHARACTER THAT I. COULD I MAKE

01:07:47.496 --> 01:07:48.864

pIS THIS ONE OF YOUR WITNESSES O.

01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:59.341
OKAY. PLEASE I'M I JUST WANTED

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:01.444
TO RESPOND TO DR PARK QUESTION

01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:02.378
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE

01:08:02.445 --> 01:08:04.113
HELPFUL TO EXPLAIN HOW THE

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.015
METROPOLITAN PROGRAM WORK AND WE

01:08:06.081 --> 01:08:08.417
CURRENTLY HAVE A CAP ON THE

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:09.985
AMOUNT OF THE REBATE SO IT'S

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:11.720
CURRENTLY TWO DOLLARS AFTER

01:08:11.787 --> 01:08:13.522
SQUARE BUT AFTER FIVE THOUSAND

01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:15.291
SQUARE FEET FOR RESIDENTIAL I'M

01:08:15.357 --> 01:08:18.561
HOME SO THAT IS THE MAXIMUM-

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:20.596
REBATES WOULD BE TEN THOUSAND

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:22.531
DOLLARS WE USED IN THE PAST IN

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:23.566
THE PREVIOUS DROUGHT WE DIDN'T

01:08:23.632 --> 01:08:25.100
HAVE A CAT AND SO THERE WILL

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:27.002
REPORT YOU KNOW THAT- WEALTHY

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:29.171
HOUSEHOLDS WITH LARGE LARGE

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:30.573
AREAS WERE BENEFITING FROM THE

01:08:30.639 --> 01:08:32.141
PROGRAM BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:33.676
THE CASE ANY LONGER THE AVERAGE

01:08:33.742 --> 01:08:36.479
SIZE. OF THE TRUCK REPLACEMENT

01:08:36.545 --> 01:08:37.980
REBATES THAT PARTICIPATE IN OUR

01:08:38.047 --> 01:08:41.317
PROGRAM IS ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED

01:08:41.383 --> 01:08:42.651
TO THIRTEEN HUNDRED SQUARE FEET

01:08:42.718 --> 01:08:44.653
AND SO THE MAJORITY OF THE

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:45.988
PARTICIPANTS IN OUR PROGRAM ARE

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:48.424
USUALLY AND I THINK I SHARED A

01:08:48.491 --> 01:08:51.660
STATISTIC WE SAID ABOUT 68% OF

01:08:51.727 --> 01:08:52.895
THOSE INVOLVED IN THE PROGRAM

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.663
FOR SORT OF LOW TO MEDIAN INCOME

01:08:54.730 --> 01:09:00.736
HELPFUL FOR THAT. THAT'S WHO WE

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:02.204
ARE TARGETING RIGHT NOW. BUT

01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:04.106
THEN THEY GET LITTLE TOO BY AS

01:09:04.173 --> 01:09:04.974
WELL THAT. LOOK THIS IS JUST

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.375
SOMETHING I'VE BEEN TALKING

01:09:06.442 --> 01:09:08.310
ABOUT FOR THE- SIX ZERO EIGHT

01:09:08.377 --> 01:09:10.679
YEARS I'VE BEEN ON THIS

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:13.115
COMMITTEE BUT THANK YOU. I I'M

01:09:13.182 --> 01:09:14.650
JUST CURIOUS THAT PRICE TAG ON

01:09:14.717 --> 01:09:16.552
THIS IS ACTUALLY PRETTY LOW SO I

01:09:16.619 --> 01:09:19.622
ASSUME THAT'S BECAUSE- MOST OF

01:09:19.688 --> 01:09:21.090
THESE REBATES ARE NOT REPORTED

01:09:21.156 --> 01:09:23.926
TO THE IRS WITHOUT THE CORRECT.

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.728
IT THAT'S PROBABLY RIGHT. AND

01:09:25.794 --> 01:09:26.996
DID YOU THINK THEY KNOW THAT

01:09:27.062 --> 01:09:28.631
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO ARE THEY

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:30.332
ISSUE TEN NINETY NINES BY ANY OF

01:09:30.399 --> 01:09:31.834
THE WATER AGENCIES YOU KNOW I'D

01:09:31.901 --> 01:09:33.035
HAVE TO LET THE WATER AGENCIES

01:09:33.102 --> 01:09:35.170
SPEAK TO THAT BUT I THINK PART

01:09:35.237 --> 01:09:36.071
OF THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT

01:09:36.138 --> 01:09:37.306
FOLKS PROBABLY GET CONSERVE

01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:38.707
CONFUSED RIGHT I MEAN THEY'VE

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:40.409
THEY'VE- PUT IN. A WATER

01:09:40.476 --> 01:09:41.210
EFFICIENT TOILET THEY PUT IN A

01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:42.344
WATER EFFICIENT WASHING MACHINE

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:44.046
THAT'S EXCLUDED FROM GROSS

01:09:44.113 --> 01:09:45.214
INCOME SO THEY MAY NOT KNOW SO

01:09:45.281 --> 01:09:46.649
PART OF THIS IS JUST ABOUT

01:09:46.715 --> 01:09:47.950
CREATING YOU KNOW UNIFORMITY AND

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:49.318
CONSISTENCY WITH THE WAY THAT WE

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:50.853
TREAT THESE ROAD REPAIRS BUT I

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.121
DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF THE

01:09:52.187 --> 01:09:54.123
WITNESSES WANT TO. WANT TO SPEAK

01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.659
TO THAT. YES NATALIE ALL THOSE

01:09:56.725 --> 01:09:58.861
ISSUES. ALL RIGHT JOINT KATHY.

01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:07.369
WHAT DOES IT ALL OF OUR MEMBERS. THIS IS SOMEBODY SPEAKING OR

01:10:07.436 --> 01:10:13.409
DID I. DO WE ARE ABDUCTED HELD

01:10:13.475 --> 01:10:16.278
FOR METROPOLITAN WE DO ISSUE A

01:10:16.345 --> 01:10:17.880
TEN NINETY NINE AND THEY'RE ALSO

01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:18.647
NOTIFIED THAT THEY'LL BE

01:10:18.714 --> 01:10:21.584
RECEIVING A TEN NINETY NINE WHEN

01:10:21.650 --> 01:10:22.151
THEY ENROLL IN THE PROGRAM.

01:10:22.217 --> 01:10:23.652
THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ASSEMBLY

MEMBER WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. YEAH

I THINK YOU MANAGER I GUESS WE

01:10:27.456 --> 01:10:29.625
JUST WANT TO- MAYBE CLARIFY TWO

01:10:29.692 --> 01:10:31.627
THINGS ONE IS THAT. I KNOW WE'VE

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:33.028
BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT TURF

01:10:33.095 --> 01:10:34.763
REBATES WHICH IS TO MAKE CLEAR

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:36.765
THIS IS NOT. JUST A REBATE AND

01:10:36.832 --> 01:10:38.467
OFTEN IS. IN IN IN MANY CASES

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:40.002
NOT A REBATE FOR INSTALLING

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:41.403
PLASTIC TURF THIS IS ABOUT

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:42.905
RIPPING UP GRASS OR SOMETHING

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:44.340
ELSE AND PUTTING IN. DROUGHT

01:10:44.406 --> 01:10:45.874
TOLERANT LANDSCAPING OR TRICKY

01:10:45.941 --> 01:10:47.009
DRIP IRRIGATION SYSTEMS OR

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:48.477
SOMETHING ELSE I KNOW WHEN

01:10:48.544 --> 01:10:50.379
PEOPLE HEAR TURF THEY MAY BE

01:10:50.446 --> 01:10:51.113
THINKING ONE THING- BUT I JUST

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:53.449
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:54.383
CLEAR FOR FOLKS. AND THEN I

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:56.018
GUESS THE FINAL THING I WOULD

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:57.152
ADD IS THAT YOU KNOW. I'M IN

01:10:57.219 --> 01:10:58.821
CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD WITH

01:10:58.887 --> 01:11:00.089
FOLKS WHO'VE MADE THIS DECISION

01:11:00.155 --> 01:11:01.256
PEOPLE REALLY LIKE THE NOTION

01:11:01.323 --> 01:11:03.025

WELL AT THE SAME TIME. AND I

01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:09.064
THINK THAT IS A POWERFUL

01:11:09.131 --> 01:11:10.065
MOTIVATOR FOR PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR

01:11:10.132 --> 01:11:11.734
AND THAT THEY CAN FEEL REALLY

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:12.234
GOOD LIKE THEY'RE DOING

01:11:12.301 --> 01:11:13.736

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:15.004

SALES TAXES ON RETAIL PURCHASES

01:11:59.915 --> 01:12:02.117
OF COBIT NINETEEN HOME TEST KITS

01:12:02.184 --> 01:12:03.852
IN HIGH QUALITY FACE MASKS.

01:12:03.919 --> 01:12:05.954
THROUGH TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THE

01:12:06.021 --> 01:12:07.056
TOTAL NUMBER OF COVERED NINETEEN

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:08.457
CASES IN CALIFORNIA HAS REACHED

01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:10.426
NEARLY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION

01:12:10.492 --> 01:12:11.927
WHILE THE STATE WIDE MASK

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:13.762

TO MASK UP YET AGAIN WARY MASKS

01:12:24.206 --> 01:12:25.941
AND USING AT HOME TEST KITS IS

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:26.942
ESSENTIAL TO STOPPING THE SPREAD

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:28.310
OF CODED. CALIFORNIA SHOULD

01:12:28.377 --> 01:12:30.045
PRIORITIZE REDUCING ECONOMIC

01:12:30.112 --> 01:12:31.447

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:19.414
JUST THE COST OF LIVING AND

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:21.650
INFLATION IS UP AND- PEOPLE NEED

01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:23.785
RELIEF AND YOU REALLY NEED TO

01:20:23.852 --> 01:20:26.621
TARGET THAT. BUT THE ISSUE ON

01:20:26.688 --> 01:20:29.157
THE GAS TAX ITSELF WAS BECAUSE

01:20:29.224 --> 01:20:31.259
FOR OVER A DECADE THERE HAVE

01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:33.628
BEEN SURCHARGES THAT GAS

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:35.330
STATIONS AND OIL REFINERIES

01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:37.999
CANNOT JUSTIFY. AND THAT IF WE

01:20:38.066 --> 01:20:41.269
WERE TO NOT CHARGE- YOU TARGET

01:20:41.336 --> 01:20:43.672
OUR GAS TAX THAT WE HAVE THAT'S

01:20:43.738 --> 01:20:46.741
THE ONE. THAT THERE IS NO PROOF

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:48.043
THAT THAT SAVINGS WOULD GET

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:50.212
PASSED ON TO ANYONE AT THE GAS

01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:51.846
PUMP THEY WOULD JUST MAINTAIN-

01:20:51.913 --> 01:20:54.015
THE SURREAL HIGH GAS PRICES

01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:56.351
THAT- THAT WE CAN'T ACTUALLY

01:20:56.418 --> 01:20:59.087
RATIONALIZE. UN ON THIS ISSUE

01:20:59.154 --> 01:21:01.022
THOUGH I WOULD I WOULD ARGUE-

01:21:01.089 --> 01:21:03.091
DIFFERENTLY- BECAUSE I RESPECT

01:21:03.158 --> 01:21:04.826
YOUR APPROACH PARTICULARLY ON ON

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:06.895
THE ITEMS TODAY IS THAT THESE

01:21:06.962 --> 01:21:09.631
ARE NOT LUXURY GOODS WERE EARLY

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:10.966
ADOPTERS ARE THE ONES WITH

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:14.903
MONEY. THIS IS TO USE THE TERM

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:16.671
SURREAL. A NECESSITY FOR

01:21:16.738 --> 01:21:20.342
EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA THAT NO

01:21:20.408 --> 01:21:23.478
ONE HAD TWO YEARS AGO. AND SALES

01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:25.780
TAXES THE MILK BOWL THE PROBABLY

01:21:25.847 --> 01:21:26.982
THE MOST REGRESSIVE TAX THAT WE

01:21:27.048 --> 01:21:29.284
HAVE AND SO THIS IS PROBABLY THE

01:21:29.351 --> 01:21:32.020
BIG EASIEST WAY TO TARGET I

01:21:32.087 --> 01:21:35.423
ACTUAL SAVINGS AT THE TILL. FOR

01:21:35.490 --> 01:21:36.558
PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING THINGS

01:21:36.625 --> 01:21:38.059
THAT PERHAPS IT OTHERWISE RATHER

01:21:38.126 --> 01:21:39.494
HAVE THAT TEN CENTS ON THE

01:21:39.561 --> 01:21:41.763
DOLLAR FOR SOMETHING THAT IS NOT

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:43.598
MORE IMPORTANT BUT IS ALSO

01:21:43.665 --> 01:21:46.134
IMPORTANT- AND SO THIS IS A WAY

01:21:46.201 --> 01:21:48.536
TO SAY LOOK AN EEVEE CHARGER-

01:21:48.603 --> 01:21:49.104
MAYBE FOR GONNA TALK ABOUT

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:50.572
CLIMATE CHANGE COULD PROTECT

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:52.907
LIFE- BUT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:54.276
PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH EVERYONE

01:21:54.342 --> 01:21:56.111
SHOULD HAVE THIS AND WE AND THIS

01:21:56.177 --> 01:21:58.280
IS A REASON TO- MAKE SURE THAT

01:21:58.346 --> 01:22:00.015
THIS IS THE EASIEST WAY TO PASS

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:03.818
THOSE SAVINGS ON- AND- AND SO I

01:22:03.885 --> 01:22:05.420
RESPECT THE- POINT THAT YOU'RE

01:22:05.487 --> 01:22:07.589
TRYING TO MAKE. BUT I WOULDN'T I

01:22:07.656 --> 01:22:08.923
WOULDN'T USE THE GAS TAX AS THE

01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:10.525
EXAMPLE FOR THE SIGN I ENJOYED

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:13.528

01:22:15.797 --> 01:22:16.798
SEMANTICS OF THAT SO THANK YOU

OCCUPIED. BY EMPTY CONTAINERS

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:19.954
BECAUSE LOADED CONTAINERS DON'T

HAVE THE EQUIPMENT TO MOVE THEM

01:34:21.422 --> 01:34:23.958

TO DO THAT IS JUST THE BEST WAY

01:34:46.814 --> 01:34:48.049
TO SPEND THE MONEY IS REALLY THE

01:34:48.115 --> 01:34:49.216

01:34:52.553 --> 01:34:56.090
THE QUESTION WE'RE GOING TO-

01:34:56.157 --> 01:34:58.192
ASK- YOUR LAST ANSWER THAT IN

01:34:58.259 --> 01:34:59.293
THE- IF FOR NO OTHER REASON

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:02.029
THAN- THIS IS THE TOOL THAT

01:35:02.096 --> 01:35:04.432
WE'VE USED IN THE PAST TO SPUR

01:35:04.498 --> 01:35:05.766
MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT. AND

01:35:05.833 --> 01:35:11.605
HAS IT WORKED. I BELIEVE SO OKAY

01:35:11.672 --> 01:35:13.607
BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:35:13.674 --> 01:35:15.176
FILM INDUSTRY ALONE. IN LA

01:35:15.242 --> 01:35:16.077
THERE'S A TAX CREDIT FOR FILMING

01:35:16.143 --> 01:35:18.312
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- FROM

01:35:18.379 --> 01:35:19.547
MY PERSPECTIVE THAT'S BEEN A

01:35:19.613 --> 01:35:22.016
TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM.

01:35:22.083 --> 01:35:23.184
AND THE PROOF WILL BE IN THE

01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:30.391
CHASSIS IS PRODUCED. A THIS IS.

01:35:30.458 --> 01:35:32.326
JUST KIND OF PICKING UP ON THAT

01:35:32.393 --> 01:35:34.328
AND AGAIN IN THE FALL WITH ANY

01:35:34.395 --> 01:35:35.563
THE BILL ANALYSIS SO THERE'S

01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:36.864
FIVE CHASSIS MANY CORRECT ME IF

01:35:36.931 --> 01:35:38.866
ANY OF THIS IS INVESTORS FIVE

01:35:38.933 --> 01:35:40.367
CHASSIS MANUFACTURERS IN THE

01:35:40.434 --> 01:35:42.603
UNITED STATES THERE'S ONE

01:35:42.670 --> 01:35:43.437
CURRENTLY OPERATING IN

01:35:43.504 --> 01:35:46.440
CALIFORNIA THIS BILL WOULD ONLY

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:49.877
APPLY TO MANUFACTURERS THAT USED

01:35:49.944 --> 01:35:51.512
TO OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA SO IS

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:53.147
THE GOAL OF THIS BILL TO

01:35:53.214 --> 01:35:56.550

FIFTEEN PHOEBE HAD A TOTALLY

01:43:00.774 --> 01:43:01.775
NORMAL PREGANCY. OUR DOCTOR

01:43:01.842 --> 01:43:04.945
EVEN JOKED- QUOTE SHE'S READING

01:43:05.012 --> 01:43:06.914

FAIL THE TIME. THEY DO DATE CAME

01:43:09.049 --> 01:43:11.685
AND WENT AND WE ANXIOUSLY WAITED

01:43:11.752 --> 01:43:14.021
FOR HER TO SHOW SIGNS THAT SHE

01:43:14.087 --> 01:43:16.223
WAS READY TO COME OUT. AND ON

01:43:16.290 --> 01:43:17.991
AUGUST ELEVENTH WE WENT IN FOR A

01:43:18.058 --> 01:43:20.093
ROUTINE APPOINTMENT AND TO

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:22.296
DISCUSS WHEN WE WOULDN'T DO

01:43:22.362 --> 01:43:24.164
THIS. WE JOKED WITH THE DOCTOR

01:43:24.231 --> 01:43:26.600
WHEN HE CAME AND SPOKE WHEN THE

01:43:26.667 --> 01:43:27.134
DOCTOR HAD TROUBLE FINDING

01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:29.870
PHOEBE'S HEART BEAT. ALL THE

01:43:29.937 --> 01:43:32.139
JOKING STOPPED. AFTER SEARCHING

01:43:32.205 --> 01:43:34.007
FOR ALMOST A MINUTE HE FINALLY

01:43:34.074 --> 01:43:36.777
HEARD A HEART BEAT EVERYONE IN

01:43:36.843 --> 01:43:38.612
THE ROOM TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF

01:43:38.679 --> 01:43:39.947
RELIEF. THAT THE DOCTOR STILL

01:43:40.013 --> 01:43:41.915
LOOKED NERVOUS. YOU TOOK MY

01:43:41.982 --> 01:43:43.951
WIFE'S WRIST ENCOUNTERED HER

01:43:44.017 --> 01:43:45.852
HOLES AND SAID THAT HE WAS

01:43:45.919 --> 01:43:48.622
PICKING UP HER HEART BEAT AND

01:43:48.689 --> 01:43:50.958
NOT OUR BABIES. HE QUICKLY

01:43:51.024 --> 01:43:52.926
PULLED HER OVER TO ANOTHER ROOM

01:43:52.993 --> 01:43:54.494
THAT CAN ALTER FOUNDED STARTED

01:43:54.561 --> 01:43:56.563
TO LOOK AT OUR DAUGHTER SHE SOON

01:43:56.630 --> 01:43:58.298
AS HE HAD HER ON THE SCREEN WE

01:43:58.365 --> 01:44:00.434
CAN ALL SEE THAT HER LITTLE

01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:01.902
HEART WAS NO LONGER FEED. HE

01:44:01.969 --> 01:44:03.770
THEN LOOKED AT US AND SAID THE

01:44:03.837 --> 01:44:05.839
WORST WORD THAT ANYONE COULD SAY

01:44:05.906 --> 01:44:08.275
TO A PERSON. I'M SORRY BUT YOUR

01:44:08.342 --> 01:44:11.111
BABY HAS DIED. WE WERE AT FORTY

01:44:11.178 --> 01:44:12.779
WEEKS WERE ACTUALLY PAST FORTY

01:44:12.846 --> 01:44:15.882
WEEKS. EVERYTHING WAS FINE UP TO

01:44:15.949 --> 01:44:18.352
THAT POINT THERE WAS SCREAMING

01:44:18.418 --> 01:44:20.454
AND CRYING FROM MY WIFE AND I

01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:22.289
FOR MONTHS. I'LL SPARE YOU THE

01:44:22.356 --> 01:44:24.358
DETAILS BUT NO THAT THAT LEVEL

01:44:24.424 --> 01:44:26.660
OF GRIEF FELT FROM PARENTS WHO

01:44:26.727 --> 01:44:28.462
HAVE NEVER NEVER GET TO HOLD

01:44:28.528 --> 01:44:31.264
THEIR BABY. HAVE TO LEAVE THE

01:44:31.331 --> 01:44:32.232
HOSPITAL WITH NOTHING IN THEIR

01:44:32.299 --> 01:44:34.735
ARMS LIVE IN A HOUSE WITH AN

01:44:34.801 --> 01:44:36.937
EMPTY NURSERY THAT THEY BUILT IS

01:44:37.004 --> 01:44:39.006
A PAIN THAT NO ONE IS EQUIPPED

01:44:39.072 --> 01:44:42.009
TO HANDLE. AND OFTEN SWALLOWS

01:44:42.075 --> 01:44:45.912
COUPLES HOLD. THIS IS WHY AB

01:44:45.979 --> 01:44:47.047
SIXTEEN NINETY SEVEN IS SO

01:44:47.114 --> 01:44:48.081
IMPORTANT I THINK IT'S NOT BAD

01:44:48.148 --> 01:44:50.250
ENOUGH THAT PARENTS HAVE TO SURF

01:44:50.317 --> 01:44:51.818
THE WAVES OF GRIEF AND FOR THE

01:44:51.885 --> 01:44:53.720
REST OF THEIR LIVES MORNING IS

01:44:53.787 --> 01:44:54.821
CHILD BUT THEY NEVER GET TO

01:44:54.888 --> 01:44:56.490
WATCH GROW UP. THEY ALSO HAVE TO

01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:59.426
DEAL WITH UNEXPECTED EXPENSES

01:44:59.493 --> 01:45:01.662
THAT ADD INSULT TO INJURY. LIKE

01:45:01.728 --> 01:45:04.665
FUNERAL COSTS BURIAL OR

01:45:04.731 --> 01:45:06.733
CREMATION COSTS. WORKING AFTER

01:45:06.800 --> 01:45:07.601
SOMETHING LIKE THAT IS

01:45:07.668 --> 01:45:09.836
IMPOSSIBLE SO THERE'S A LACK OF

01:45:09.903 --> 01:45:12.039
INCOME IN SOME CASES. SOME

01:45:12.105 --> 01:45:13.440
COUPLES NEED TO LEAVE THEIR

01:45:13.507 --> 01:45:16.610
HOUSE OR TOWN FOR A BIT IN ORDER

01:45:16.677 --> 01:45:17.844
TO COLLECT THEIR THOUGHTS TO BE

01:45:17.911 --> 01:45:20.480
ALONE. ARABY IS ESSENTIAL IN MY

01:45:20.547 --> 01:45:22.049
OPINION WHEN IT COMES TO

01:45:22.115 --> 01:45:23.316
MANAGING NOT ONLY GRIEF BUT

01:45:23.383 --> 01:45:26.353
POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS. AND IT IS

01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:28.355
OFTEN NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE.

01:45:28.422 --> 01:45:30.490
AND FINALLY THE MOST ROBUST

01:45:30.557 --> 01:45:33.093
MEDICAL EXPENSES TO PAY FOR THE

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.728
BIRTH OF A BABY THAT YOU NOW

01:45:34.795 --> 01:45:37.364
HAVE TO BURY. OVER THE PAST

01:45:37.431 --> 01:45:39.533
SEVERAL DECADES INFANT MORTALITY

01:45:39.599 --> 01:45:41.702
HAS SUCCESSFULLY DECLINE HOWEVER

01:45:41.768 --> 01:45:43.637
STILL BIRTH HAVE YOU KNOW. THEIR

01:45:43.704 --> 01:45:46.206
MYSTERIOUS AND WHAT CAUSES THEM

01:45:46.273 --> 01:45:48.208
AND THE NUMBER OF HIDDEN DANGERS

01:45:48.275 --> 01:45:50.043
IN TWENTY FIFTEEN OUR DAUGHTER

01:45:50.110 --> 01:45:51.211
PHOEBE LAINGSBURG THEN WAS ONE

01:45:51.278 --> 01:45:52.879
OF TWENTY SIX THOUSAND

01:45:52.946 --> 01:45:55.315
STILLBIRTHS IN AMERICA. IT'S FAR

01:45:55.382 --> 01:45:57.084
MORE COMMON THAN PEOPLE REALIZE

01:45:57.150 --> 01:45:59.019
AND THE PARENTS OF THOSE TWENTY

01:45:59.086 --> 01:46:02.823
SIX THOUSAND. BORN STILL EVERY

ARE VERY LUCKY PEOPLE WE WERE

01:46:07.194 --> 01:46:08.729
ABLE TO HANDLE ALL THOSE

01:46:08.795 --> 01:46:10.897
EXPENSES BUT WE KNOW MANY PEOPLE

01:46:10.964 --> 01:46:13.500
WHO COULDN'T AND HAD TO CHOOSE

01:46:13.567 --> 01:46:15.635
WHICH CRUCIAL HEALING EXPERIENCE

01:46:15.702 --> 01:46:17.771
THEY WERE GOING TO BUY PASSED.

01:46:17.838 --> 01:46:19.740
BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD IT

01:46:19.806 --> 01:46:20.907
. DEALING WITH THE LOSS OF A

01:46:20.974 --> 01:46:23.176
CHILD THE WAY THAT WE AND SO

01:46:23.243 --> 01:46:25.312
MANY OTHERS HAVE HAD TO DO IS

01:46:25.378 --> 01:46:27.047
THE WORST THING A PERSON CAN GO

01:46:27.114 --> 01:46:28.849
THROUGH SO WHATEVER ANYONE CAN

01:46:28.915 --> 01:46:31.251
DO TO MAKE IT LESS TERRIBLE IT'S

01:46:31.318 --> 01:46:36.523
TRULY A BLACK. YOU ALL HAVE THE-POWER TO DO THAT. PEOPLE LIKE US

01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:38.792

NEVER FORGET HER IS MORE HEALING

01:46:45.365 --> 01:46:47.200
THAN MOST REALIZE. NO GRIEVING

SALT IN OUR WOUNDS THAT WOULD

01:49:13.813 --> 01:49:15.882
NEVER HEAL. AS A LOT OF PARENTS

EITHER EXCRUCIATING OMISSION. IT

FROM THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLY

02:06:23.709 --> 02:06:27.146
MEMBER CORK YES ALSO I HAVE A

02:06:27.212 --> 02:06:28.247
CONCERN ABOUT THE WAY THIS WOULD

02:06:28.314 --> 02:06:30.449
BE ADMINISTERED I REALLY THINK

02:06:30.516 --> 02:06:32.318
IT IS ASKING TOO MUCH OF A

02:06:32.384 --> 02:06:35.187
PARENT WHO HAS LOST A CHILD TO

02:06:35.254 --> 02:06:37.556
KEEP RECEIPTS AND THEN SIX

02:06:37.623 --> 02:06:40.592
MONTHS LATER BUT IN A TAX RETURN

02:06:40.659 --> 02:06:43.829
IT JUST THE PAIN WOULD BE TOO

02:06:43.896 --> 02:06:44.930
MUCH I MEAN I JUST CAN'T

02:06:44.997 --> 02:06:47.967
IMAGINE. HOW AWFUL YOU WOULD

02:06:48.033 --> 02:06:51.337
FEEL AT THE TIME AND HOW. HI

02:06:51.403 --> 02:06:52.771
KEEPING RECEIPTS MIGHT BE THE

02:06:52.838 --> 02:06:55.741
LAST THING ON YOUR MIND. SO I

02:06:55.808 --> 02:06:57.109
WOULD PREFER IT THE OTHER THING

02:06:57.176 --> 02:06:58.777
IS IF YOU REALLY ARE KEEPING

02:06:58.844 --> 02:07:00.746
RECEIPTS AND THERE ARE AUDITED

02:07:00.813 --> 02:07:03.182
AND THIS AND THAT. IT REALLY

02:07:03.248 --> 02:07:05.351
RAISES THE COST OF WHAT YOU'RE

02:07:05.417 --> 02:07:07.052
TRYING TO DO. I WOULD THINK A

02:07:07.119 --> 02:07:08.887
BETTER APPROACH WOULD BE TO TAKE

02:07:08.954 --> 02:07:10.723
SOME SORT OF A STANDARD.

02:07:10.789 --> 02:07:13.459
APPROACH AND THAT PERHAPS MIGHT

02:07:13.525 --> 02:07:15.694
BE THE CHILD TAX CREDIT. JUST

02:07:15.761 --> 02:07:19.531
MAKING PEOPLE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT-

02:07:19.598 --> 02:07:22.468
AS YOU SAID IN YOUR STATEMENT-

02:07:22.534 --> 02:07:23.869
IF YOUR LIFE FOR ONE MINUTE YOU

02:07:23.936 --> 02:07:26.739
GET THE CHILD IS ELIGIBLE FOR

02:07:26.805 --> 02:07:29.208
THE FAMILY TO TAKE THE- THE TAX

02:07:29.274 --> 02:07:32.177
CREDIT AND IF THEY'RE STILL BORN

02:07:32.244 --> 02:07:36.248
THEY'RE NOT. THAT SEEMS. MMHM

02:07:36.315 --> 02:07:39.118
I'M JOSH TO ME AND I THINK AN

02:07:39.184 --> 02:07:40.586
APPROACH ALONG THOSE LINES WOULD

02:07:40.652 --> 02:07:42.021
WORK BETTER BOTH IN TERMS OF

02:07:42.087 --> 02:07:45.290

02:07:53.032 --> 02:07:54.500
YOU CERTAINLY BROUGHT UP

SOMETHING WE ALL SHOULD BE AWARE

02:07:56.368 --> 02:07:59.104
OF. BUT AGAIN- I KNOW THIS IS-

02:07:59.171 --> 02:08:03.342
SORT OF PRELIMINARY- AND- AN

02:08:03.409 --> 02:08:05.477
OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE THE

02:08:05.544 --> 02:08:07.513
POSSIBILITIES AND I THINK THAT.

02:08:07.579 --> 02:08:10.783
WHAT WE ARE ABOUT. IS AN IRAQ

02:08:10.849 --> 02:08:11.884

THE RECEIPTS AND ALL OF THAT-

02:08:16.655 --> 02:08:19.792
AND IT DID STRIKE ME AS- UNFAIR-

02:08:19.858 --> 02:08:24.063
THAT IF IT'S STILL BARNETT.

02:08:24.129 --> 02:08:26.899

SPACE TO ESSENTIALLY REWRITE BUT

02:08:42.648 --> 02:08:44.616
IF THERE'S AN INTEREST IN.

02:08:44.683 --> 02:08:47.186
WORKING ON THIS AS SUGGESTED BY

WE MIGHT PROCEED. I THINK IT

02:09:24.289 --> 02:09:26.458

REFOCUS- THE BILL IN A WAY THAT

02:09:33.132 --> 02:09:35.467
WOULD BE LESS BURDENSOME ON THE

PARENTS. I MEAN EVEN LOOKING AT

02:09:37.503 --> 02:09:40.139

02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:49.882

THROUGH. THAT PROCESS AND

02:10:00.826 --> 02:10:02.928
SUPPORTING A BILL THAT WOULD

ALSO. YOU KNOW IT'S NOT A BAD

02:41:06.123 --> 02:41:08.258
THING TO HAVE PEOPLE MOVE OT OF

THE STATE WE HAVE A HOUSING

02:41:09.092 --> 02:41:11.628
CRISIS. AND PARTICULARLY FUEHRER

BUSINESS- SAY THE TEN SAN DIEGO

02:41:18.769 --> 02:41:20.871
IT MAY MAKE SENSE TO MOVE

02:41:20.937 --> 02:41:23.507
OUTSIDE OF THAT AREA. AND HAVE

02:41:23.573 --> 02:41:26.243
THE HOUSING AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE

02:41:26.309 --> 02:41:26.943
WHO NEED TO COMMUTE TO THAT

02:41:27.010 --> 02:41:32.549
HOUSING- I KNOW THAT SOUNDS.

02:41:32.616 --> 02:41:35.485
DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT BUT- THERE

02:41:35.552 --> 02:41:37.721
IS A HOUSING SHORTAGE AND IT'S A

02:41:37.788 --> 02:41:39.556
REAL BIG CONCERN AND

02:41:39.623 --> 02:41:43.360
INCENTIVIZING PEOPLE TO STAY. A

02:41:43.427 --> 02:41:45.429
MAY NOT BE THE BEST WAY TO SOLVE

02:41:45.495 --> 02:41:48.632
IT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M

02:41:48.698 --> 02:41:50.100
NOT SURE THAT QUESTION IS

02:41:50.167 --> 02:41:51.268
DIRECTLY ASKED THEM IF I COULD

02:41:51.334 --> 02:41:53.303
ADDRESS SOME OF THE OPPOSITION.

02:41:53.370 --> 02:41:54.438
BUT SHOULD I ADDRESS THIS

02:41:54.504 --> 02:41:56.306
QUESTION FIRST FOR HIS COMMENTS

AS OPPOSITION IT TALKED ABOUT-

02:42:02.746 --> 02:42:04.681
NOT REALLY FOR FILLING THE

02:42:04.748 --> 02:42:06.149
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WORKFORCE

02:42:06.216 --> 02:42:08.185
DEVELOPMENT HOWEVER- THE

02:42:08.251 --> 02:42:10.053
ARGUMENT IS THAT IT ALSO WILL

02:42:10.120 --> 02:42:12.189
SERVICE ON A PLAN OF RETIREMENT

02:42:12.255 --> 02:42:13.557
THOSE THAT ARE DISCHARGED FROM

02:42:13.623 --> 02:42:15.192
THE MILITARY THAT DO GO INTO.

02:42:15.258 --> 02:42:17.027
THE SKILLED WORKFORCE HERE IN

02:42:17.094 --> 02:42:18.895
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COULD

02:42:18.962 --> 02:42:20.630
SEE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

02:42:20.697 --> 02:42:22.432
THEIR RETIREMENT PLANNING TO

02:42:22.499 --> 02:42:23.800
AUTOMATICALLY GET TO THAT POINT

02:42:23.867 --> 02:42:25.235
WHERE THEY COULD THEN BENEFIT

02:42:25.302 --> 02:42:27.437
FROM THE EXEMPTIONS- MOVING

02:42:27.504 --> 02:42:30.907
FORWARD. AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER-

DISCHARGED FROM THE MILITARY

02:42:34.111 --> 02:42:37.147
THEY DO- ATTAIN GI BILLS TO

02:42:37.214 --> 02:42:39.282
OFFER THEM TO PURCHASE HOMES SO

02:42:39.349 --> 02:42:40.884
IT DOES HELP THE HOUSING

02:42:40.951 --> 02:42:42.986
COMPONENT TO FOR OUR MILITARY.

02:42:43.053 --> 02:42:45.021

DAY- SO I USED TO BOB DONATE

FOUR TIMES YEAR WHEN I WORKED AT

02:51:29.379 --> 02:51:31.214
LARGE FLAVAN. ONE OF THE MAJOR

02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:33.549
REASONS FOR IT. BESIDES THAT

02:51:33.616 --> 02:51:36.953
THEY GAVE OUT DONUTS- WAS THAT

02:51:37.020 --> 02:51:39.589
IT WAS VERY CONVENIENT. AND THAT

02:51:39.656 --> 02:51:41.290
THEY WOULD COME FOUR OR EVEN

02:51:41.357 --> 02:51:43.092
MORE TIMES A YEAR TO THE LAB

02:51:43.159 --> 02:51:44.961
BECAUSE THEY GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE

02:51:45.028 --> 02:51:47.230
COMING IN IT WAS ENCOURAGED. THE

02:51:47.296 --> 02:51:49.899
QUESTION I HAVE IS THIS FIVE

02:51:49.966 --> 02:51:51.334
HUNDRED DOLLAR TAX CREDIT AND

02:51:51.401 --> 02:51:53.536
I'M GLAD IT TO CREDIT NOT A

02:51:53.603 --> 02:51:54.737
DEDUCTION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

02:51:54.804 --> 02:51:57.173
THAT. I THINK THAT'S A MORE

02:51:57.240 --> 02:52:00.176
APPROPRIATE WAY TO GO- IS THAT

02:52:00.243 --> 02:52:03.312
GOING TO BE. THE MOST EFFECTIVE

02:52:03.379 --> 02:52:05.581
WAY TO SPEND THAT MONEY. YOU'RE

02:52:05.648 --> 02:52:08.785
ALSO GOING TO HAVE A PROBLEM

02:52:08.851 --> 02:52:10.820
JUST ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM

02:52:10.887 --> 02:52:12.622
WHAT KIND OF PROOF FOR YOU CAN

02:52:12.689 --> 02:52:16.125
HAVE IT CETERA- SO THAT'S A

02:52:16.192 --> 02:52:17.994
QUESTION THAT I THINK YOU NEED

02:52:18.061 --> 02:52:20.229
TO LOOK AT IN THE BILL BUT- MY

02:52:20.296 --> 02:52:21.764
QUESTION IS THIS REALLY THE BEST

02:52:21.831 --> 02:52:23.066
WAY TO SPEND THE MONEY WOULD IT

02:52:23.132 --> 02:52:25.201
MAKE MORE SENSE TO SAY FROM THE

02:52:25.268 --> 02:52:28.438
BLOOD BANK. TO MAKE MORE MOBILE

02:52:28.504 --> 02:52:31.708
CALLS. I DON'T KNOW. WELL THE

02:52:31.774 --> 02:52:33.176
WE'RE LOOKING AT IT NOW I MEAN

02:52:33.242 --> 02:52:35.445
WE GOT TO BE ABLE TO THINK MORE

02:52:35.511 --> 02:52:36.913
CREATIVE HOW WE GET MORE PEOPLE

02:52:36.979 --> 02:52:38.614
TO DONATE BLOOD OBVIOUSLY. THIS

02:52:38.681 --> 02:52:41.117
IS A CRISIS THAT WE HAVEN'T SEEN

02:52:41.184 --> 02:52:43.820
IN DECADES SO I THINK WE HAVE TO

02:52:43.886 --> 02:52:45.254
THINK ACOSTA DIFFERENTLY HOW WE

02:52:45.321 --> 02:52:46.889
CAN GET INCENTIVIZE MORE PEOPLE

02:52:46.956 --> 02:52:48.791
COME OUT TO DONATE BLOOD WE CAN

02:52:48.858 --> 02:52:50.259
DO THE DIGITAL BLOOD BANKS AND

02:52:50.326 --> 02:52:51.894
WHATNOT BUT IF WE DON'T GET MORE

02:52:51.961 --> 02:52:53.029
PEOPLE OUT TO THOSE BUT BANKS

02:52:53.096 --> 02:52:54.864
ARE KIND OF DEFEATING THE

02:52:54.931 --> 02:52:56.032
PURPOSE BUT I THINK THIS IS JUST

02:52:56.099 --> 02:52:58.167
ONE WAY. TO LET FOLKS KNOW THAT

02:52:58.234 --> 02:52:59.235
THERE IS AN INCENTIVE FOR

02:52:59.302 --> 02:53:01.137
CONDONING BUT IN ONLY FOUR TIMES

02:53:01.204 --> 02:53:02.939
IN ONE YEAR SO I THINK IT'S THE

02:53:03.005 --> 02:53:04.807
BEST APPROACH BUT I'M OPEN TO

02:53:04.874 --> 02:53:06.576
