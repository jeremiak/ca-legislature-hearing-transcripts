REPRESENTING TRANSPORTATION

CALIFORNIA THE TRANSPORTATION

00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:42.060
INDUSTRY ORGANIZATION THAT

00:22:42.127 --> 00:22:44.429
REPRESENTS A PEOPLE WHO BUILD

00:22:44.496 --> 00:22:46.364
REPAIR- THIS STATE HIGHWAY

00:22:46.431 --> 00:22:49.634
SYSTEM- FIRST I'D LIKE TO START

00:22:49.701 --> 00:22:51.069
BY CANNELLA JIM THAT WE ENJOYED

00:22:51.136 --> 00:22:52.604
A VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION

00:22:52.671 --> 00:22:55.474
WITH THE AUTHOR'S. OFFICE AND

00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:57.409
STAFF A WEEK AND A HALF AGO AND

00:22:57.476 --> 00:22:58.844
THAT LED US TO TAKE OF OPPOSE

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.278
UNLESS AMENDED POSITION RATHER

00:23:00.345 --> 00:23:01.847
THAN AN OUTRIGHT OPPOSE SO IS

00:23:01.913 --> 00:23:03.381
BENEFICIAL FOR THEM AND

00:23:03.448 --> 00:23:06.251
BENEFICIAL FOR US. WE ORIGINALLY

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:06.852
FOUND THE MEASURE TO BE VERY

00:23:06.918 --> 00:23:08.887
RESTRICTIVE AND BELIEVE THAT

00:23:08.954 --> 00:23:10.455
WOULD POTENTIALLY LOCK UP THE

00:23:10.522 --> 00:23:11.890
ENTIRE CORRIDORS WITHIN THE

00:23:11.957 --> 00:23:13.892
STATE THAT ARE BENEFICIAL ROUTES

00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:15.894
FOR MOVING PEOPLE AND GOODS-

00:23:15.961 --> 00:23:19.998
HOWEVER WE ALSO FOR FULLY

00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:22.801
BEHIND THE- THE GENESIS OF THE

00:23:22.868 --> 00:23:24.903
BILL. SAID WHICH IS A STRONG

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:26.705
DESIRE TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO

00:23:26.772 --> 00:23:27.539
COMMUNITY COMMUNITIES

00:23:27.606 --> 00:23:29.908
EXPERIENCING CALIFORNIA'S WORST

00:23:29.975 --> 00:23:32.210
AIR QUALITY. AND FREQUENTLY

00:23:32.277 --> 00:23:33.578
LOCATED NEAR HIGHWAYS AND

00:23:33.645 --> 00:23:37.015
ROADWAYS THAT- THE STATE IS

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:38.016
IMPLEMENTED. BUT AS WE DISCUSSED

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:39.684
WITH THE OFFICE STAFF WE SUGGEST

00:23:39.751 --> 00:23:40.919
THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED TO

00:23:40.986 --> 00:23:42.788
ELIMINATE THE DIRECT TIÞN TO THE

00:23:42.854 --> 00:23:45.724
INDEX. AS WE FIND THAT ELEMENT

00:23:45.791 --> 00:23:46.625
TO BE INAPPROPRIATE THE STATE

00:23:46.691 --> 00:23:48.560
<u>GENCY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FACE</u>

00:23:48.627 --> 00:23:49.528
IT'S CRITICAL FUNDING AND

00:23:49.594 --> 00:23:51.963
STAFFING- DECISIONS ON

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.733
METHODOLOGIES OF A THIRD PARTY

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.135
ENTITY. AND THAT THOSE POSH

00:23:57.202 --> 00:23:58.537
THOSE- METHODOLOGIES COULD

00:23:58.603 --> 00:24:01.072
CHANGE OVER TIME. WITHOUT MUCH

00:24:01.139 --> 00:24:03.241
PUBLIC INPUT AND IT'S OF CONCERN

00:24:03.308 --> 00:24:05.243
TO US SECONDLY WE ALSO FIND THE

00:24:05.310 --> 00:24:07.312
STATUTORY THRESHOLD LIMIT BUILT

00:24:07.379 --> 00:24:09.681
IN. FOR THE CONSULT CONSULTATION

00:24:09.748 --> 00:24:12.784
THE THIRTY PERCENTILE STANDARD.

00:24:12.851 --> 00:24:15.020
THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE. 50%

00:24:15.086 --> 00:24:16.688
BELOW THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE NO

00:24:16.755 --> 00:24:18.623
MATTER WHAT THE UNDERLYING

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.392
NUMBERS ARE IN FACTORS ARE SO

00:24:20.458 --> 00:24:21.793
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IT BUT

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.361
NEVERTHELESS WE ARE OPPOSE

00:24:23.428 --> 00:24:24.729
UNLESS AMENDED AND WOULD LOOK

00:24:24.796 --> 00:24:26.598
FORWARD TO WORKING. CLOSELY

00:24:26.665 --> 00:24:29.334
WITH- THE AUTHORS OFFICE IF THE

00:24:29.401 --> 00:24:31.102
BILL PASSES OUT OF COMMITTEE.

00:24:31.169 --> 00:24:33.071
THANK YOU NECKLACE PLEASE THANK

00:24:33.138 --> 00:24:35.207
YOU MADAM CHAIR AND PADAM SHARON

00:24:35.273 --> 00:24:37.075
MEMBERS I'M WHERE A TOP. HERE ON

00:24:37.142 --> 00:24:38.810
BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY

00:24:38.877 --> 00:24:39.377
TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY AND

00:24:39.444 --> 00:24:41.479
REGRETTABLY WE TOO ARE HERE IN

00:24:41.546 --> 00:24:44.282
OPPOSITION. I'M WE ARE SENSITIVE

00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:46.685
AND APPRECIATE THE- THE REASON

00:24:46.751 --> 00:24:49.788
BEHIND THE BILL AND- WE JUST

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:51.156
THINK THAT THE BILL AS IT'S

00:24:51.223 --> 00:24:53.358
CURRENTLY DRAFTED IS FAR TOO

00:24:53.425 --> 00:24:55.327
BROAD IT IS RESTRICTIVE. I'M

00:24:55.393 --> 00:24:57.362
ALSO FELL COUNTIES INCLUDING

00:24:57.429 --> 00:24:59.531
OURS WHEN WE WENT TO THE VOTERS

00:24:59.598 --> 00:25:01.800
TO ASK- ARE VOTERS TO. PAY AN

00:25:01.867 --> 00:25:03.702
EXTRA HALF CENT SALES TAX TO

00:25:03.768 --> 00:25:05.837
FUND TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS.

00:25:05.904 --> 00:25:07.973
WE DID SO BY GIVING THEM A LIST

00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:09.875
OF PROJECTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:25:09.941 --> 00:25:10.775
GET FUNDED. I'M WE HAVE AN

00:25:10.842 --> 00:25:12.878
OBLIGATION TO FILL THE TOOK TO

00:25:12.944 --> 00:25:13.445
FINISH THOSE PROJECTS WE'RE

00:25:13.511 --> 00:25:14.913
WORKING OUR WAY THROUGH THAT

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.882
LIST OF PROJECTS RIGHT NOW. BUT

00:25:16.948 --> 00:25:18.583
THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT US FROM

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.118
COMPLETING THAT LIST SOME OF

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:21.987
THOSE PROJECTS DO FALL WITHIN

00:25:22.053 --> 00:25:22.921
THE DEFINITION THAT'S INCLUDED

00:25:22.988 --> 00:25:24.689
IN THE BILL. SO WE NEED CAUGHT

00:25:24.756 --> 00:25:26.324
BETWIXT AND BETWEEN BETWEEN TWO

00:25:26.391 --> 00:25:28.526
LAWS WE HAVE A AN ABSOLUTELY

00:25:28.593 --> 00:25:31.296
L'APPLICATION TO- TO FINISH THE

00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:32.631
PROJECTS THAT WE TOLD THE VOTERS

00:25:32.697 --> 00:25:33.899
WE WOULD. AND YET THIS BILL

00:25:33.965 --> 00:25:35.166
WOULD PROHIBIT US UNFORTUNATELY

00:25:35.233 --> 00:25:39.304
FROM DOING THAT. AND THEN- L. O.

00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:40.906
WE DO THINK THE BILL IS

00:25:40.972 --> 00:25:42.908
PARTICULARLY BROAD. WE KNOW THAT

00:25:42.974 --> 00:25:43.942
THERE ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE

00:25:44.009 --> 00:25:45.977
CURRENTLY IN THE IN THE-

00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:47.312
PRODUCTION PHASE IN THE

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:48.346
DEVELOPMENT PHASE.

00:25:48.413 --> 00:25:49.581
TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS TAKE A

00:25:49.648 --> 00:25:51.683
VERY LONG TIME TO- TO BRING TO

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:53.885
TH TO FRUITION. THE BILL DOESN'T

00:25:53.952 --> 00:25:54.886
DISCUSS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO

00:25:54.953 --> 00:25:55.420
THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE

00:25:55.487 --> 00:25:57.822
CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT AND SO

00:25:57.889 --> 00:25:59.491
WE COULD HOLD THE PROJECT

00:25:59.557 --> 00:26:00.792
MIDWAY. WE DON'T THINK THAT

00:26:00.859 --> 00:26:02.193
MAKES SENSE AND LASTLY WOULD SAY

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:03.461
SOME OF THE THESE PROJECTS THAT

00:26:03.528 --> 00:26:04.763
WE'RE WORKING ON EVEN ON THE

00:26:04.829 --> 00:26:06.431
HIGHWAY SYSTEM ARE CONSISTENT

00:26:06.498 --> 00:26:08.566
WITH OUR OUR SCS. THEY COULD BE

00:26:08.633 --> 00:26:11.870
DONE IN WITH- THE PURPOSE OF.

00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:13.138
HOW A MEDICARE- CONGESTION

00:26:13.204 --> 00:26:15.206
MITIGATION. BUT ACTUALLY WOULD

00:26:15.273 --> 00:26:16.841
HELP SOME OF THOSE AND SOME OF

00:26:16.908 --> 00:26:18.677
THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT SURROUND.

00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:20.478
ON THE PROJECTS AND SO AGAIN WE

00:26:20.545 --> 00:26:21.513
THINK IT'S OVERLY BROAD WE

00:26:21.579 --> 00:26:22.580
REALLY DO LOOK FORWARD TO

00:26:22.647 --> 00:26:24.749
WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE

00:26:24.816 --> 00:26:26.117
BILL MOVES FORWARD BUT AT THIS

00:26:26.184 --> 00:26:27.485
POINT. WITH THE BILL AS DRAFTED

00:26:27.552 --> 00:26:28.520
WE ARE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU

00:26:28.586 --> 00:26:31.056
MODEL YOU STAY THERE IN CASES

00:26:31.122 --> 00:26:31.723
QUESTIONS FOR YOU LATER. THAT'S

00:35:06.137 --> 00:35:07.672
THAT THE CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE

00:35:07.738 --> 00:35:09.106
BOTH WITH THE OPPOSITION AT THE

00:35:09.173 --> 00:35:11.809
DESK AS WELL AS THOSE THAT-

BUT MAYBE THE- THE OPPONENTS CAN

00:35:19.784 --> 00:35:23.254
ALSO- CHIME IN TOO BUT- MY

00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:25.223
CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS THAT.

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:26.591
IT WOULD POTENTIALLY MAKE

00:35:26.657 --> 00:35:28.559
CONGESTION WORSE THIS BILL WOULD

00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:31.529
BAN PROJECTS- THAT ARE DESIGNED

00:35:31.596 --> 00:35:33.965
TO REDUCE TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND

00:35:34.031 --> 00:35:35.867
CONGESTED CORRIDORS. AND SO A

00:35:35.933 --> 00:35:37.602
LOT OF THE PROJECTS THAT ARE

00:35:37.668 --> 00:35:38.769
SLATED FOR CONSTRUCTION THAT ARE

00:35:38.836 --> 00:35:40.204
ALREADY UNDERWAY OR THAT ARE

00:35:40.271 --> 00:35:41.806
GOING THROUGH THE REVIEW PROCESS

00:35:41.873 --> 00:35:44.876
THIS BILL- AT THE WAY I READ IT.

00:35:44.942 --> 00:35:47.645
WOULD WOULD HAVE THESE PROJECTS

00:35:47.712 --> 00:35:50.348
STOP AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED TO.

00:35:50.414 --> 00:35:51.682
ENCOURAGE GOOD MOVEMENTS WITH

00:35:51.749 --> 00:35:52.617
OUR SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES

00:35:52.683 --> 00:35:54.986
EVERYTHING ELSE- WE ALSO NEED TO

00:35:55.052 --> 00:35:56.787
BE INVESTING IN IN CRITICAL

00:35:56.854 --> 00:35:58.656
FREIGHT CORRIDORS WHICH A LOT OF

00:35:58.723 --> 00:36:00.558
THESE PROJECTS ARE INTO SO HOW

00:36:00.625 --> 00:36:03.394
HOW WHAT IS YOUR- WHAT IS YOUR

00:36:03.461 --> 00:36:06.631
RESPONSE. TO THAT. THANK YOU I

ACTUALLY LIVE OFF OF ONE OF

00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:09.867
THOSE GOODS MOVEMENT ALTHOUGH

00:36:09.934 --> 00:36:11.502
THAT'S COMING INTO THE PORT OF

00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:13.337
LONG BEACH AND LA AND UP ON THE

00:36:13.404 --> 00:36:14.972
SEVEN TEN FREEWAY AND READ

00:36:16.507 --> 00:36:17.942

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:20.545
OTHER FREE WITH A THICK SIDE.

00:36:20.611 --> 00:36:23.314
ARE IN SO A GREAT WAY TO HELP IS

00:36:23.381 --> 00:36:26.017
TO GET US OUT OF OUR CARS AND

00:36:26.083 --> 00:36:26.651
INVEST IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION

00:36:26.717 --> 00:36:28.085
WE HAVE. A GOAL LINE IN THE AREA

00:36:28.152 --> 00:36:30.788
WE HAVE AN ORANGE LAND AREA ALL

00:36:30.855 --> 00:36:31.455
THAT WERE INITIALLY SLATED TO BE

00:36:31.522 --> 00:36:32.623
COMPLETED IN TWENTY FIFTY EIGHT.

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:33.824
COMMUNITY HAS BEEN PUSHING HARD

00:36:33.891 --> 00:36:35.660
TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN IN THIS

00:36:35.726 --> 00:36:36.827
COUNTRY AND I THINK WE'RE GOING

00:36:36.894 --> 00:36:38.696
TO GET THERE. ARE OUT THERE TO

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:40.298
HELP THOSE GOODS MOVEMENTS MOVE

00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:41.832
I WANT THEM TO MOVE ALSO THERE

00:36:41.899 --> 00:36:43.467
ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR- ECONOMY.

00:36:43.534 --> 00:36:44.435
AS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:45.770
PROJECTS WE HAVE MORE RESEARCH

00:36:45.836 --> 00:36:47.505
AND MORE DATA SHOWING US THAT

00:36:47.572 --> 00:36:48.706
SOMETIMES WHAT WE THINK WE ARE

00:36:48.773 --> 00:36:49.640
HELPING WITH CONGESTION WERE

00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:51.008
ACTUALLY DOING THE OPPOSITE. AND

00:36:51.075 --> 00:36:52.510
SO I THINK FOR MYSELF IT'S

00:36:52.577 --> 00:36:53.844
TAKING WHAT WE'VE LEARNED THANK

00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:55.913
IN OUR COMMITMENT TO EQUITY AND

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:56.647
HOW TO RETHINK THIS IT BY NO

00:36:56.714 --> 00:36:58.683
MEANS I TRY TO PRETEND THAT THIS

00:36:58.749 --> 00:37:00.651
BILL IS PERFECT. BUT AS WE

00:37:00.718 --> 00:37:01.419
CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE

00:37:01.485 --> 00:37:02.853
OPPOSITION IS HOW DO WE CREATE

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.689
SOMETHING BETTER I THINK AT THE

00:37:04.755 --> 00:37:05.957
END OF THE DAY WE'RE ALL

00:37:06.023 --> 00:37:07.992
COMMITTED TO SOMETHING THAT'S

00:37:08.059 --> 00:37:08.926
MORE EQUITABLE ARE MOLD MORE

00:37:08.993 --> 00:37:09.527
JUST THE ONLY PIECE I DID ON

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:11.596
THE- FROM THE OPPOSITE. IS ABLE.

00:37:11.662 --> 00:37:13.497
THIS A HOUSING KILLER WHEN

00:37:13.564 --> 00:37:14.065
DISPLACING FOR EXAMPLE. TWO

00:37:14.131 --> 00:37:14.865
THOUSAND FAMILIES ON THE

00:37:14.932 --> 00:37:16.133
SEVENTEEN PREVIOUS SOUNDS LIKE A

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.902
LITTLE BIT MORE OF A HEALTHY

00:37:17.969 --> 00:37:19.337
COLOR TO ME. OTHERWISE I'LL BUT

00:37:19.403 --> 00:37:20.738
I AM COMMITTED TO FINDING IN

00:37:20.805 --> 00:37:22.840
THAT SPOT IF THERE ARE PROJECTS

00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:23.774
THAT. ARE NEEDED FOR SAFETY.

00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:25.910
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GET IN THE

00:37:25.977 --> 00:37:27.411
MIDDLE OF THOSE. I THINK SOME OF

00:37:27.478 --> 00:37:29.013
THE SENSORS THAT HAVE. BEEN

00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:30.581
BROUGHT UP THERE IS A PATH. WAY

00:37:30.648 --> 00:37:31.882
FORWARD BUT I THINK THE REALITY

00:37:31.949 --> 00:37:33.751
IS THAT SOME DECISIONS WERE MADE

00:37:33.818 --> 00:37:34.685
TWENTY YEARS AGO. THEY NOT

00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:35.486
REALLY. TAKING INTO

00:37:35.553 --> 00:37:36.287
CONSIDERATION ALL THAT WE'VE

00:37:36.354 --> 00:37:38.389
LEARNED IN THE TWENTY YEARS AND

00:37:38.456 --> 00:37:39.590
WE NEED EVERYTHING SOME OF THOSE

00:37:39.657 --> 00:37:41.325
IDEAS AND WE'RE STARTING TO IN

00:37:41.392 --> 00:37:42.393
PLACES. WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:44.195
DOING THAT CONSISTENTLY ACROSS

00:37:44.261 --> 00:37:44.996
THE STATE NOT JUST IN SOME

00:37:45.062 --> 00:37:48.899
POCKETS. NO I'M SORRY THANK YOU

00:37:48.966 --> 00:37:51.168
VERY MUCH. HI I USED TO KNOW HOW

00:37:51.235 --> 00:37:53.137
TO DO THIS- I THINK. FROM OUR

00:37:53.204 --> 00:37:54.972
PERSPECTIVE AND THAT'S WHY WE

00:37:55.039 --> 00:37:56.040
WERE GRATEFUL TO THE AUTHOR

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:57.942
STAFF TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION

00:37:58.009 --> 00:37:59.610
BECAUSE- WE THINK. SEEK WHAT

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:02.346
NEPA IDENTIFIES AND HAS

00:38:02.413 --> 00:38:04.215
CONSULTATION PROCESSES AND COMES

00:38:04.281 --> 00:38:05.950
UP WITH MITIGATION PROGRAMS.

00:38:06.017 --> 00:38:07.852
THAT AVOID CONFLICTS THAT ARE

00:38:07.918 --> 00:38:10.087
AVOIDABLE. AND WE THINK THAT'S

00:38:10.154 --> 00:38:10.788
MUCH MORE PREFERABLE THAN

00:38:10.855 --> 00:38:14.659
HANGING- PROJECTS FUTURE ON A-

00:38:14.725 --> 00:38:16.661
ON AN INDEX. THAT COULD CHANGE

00:38:16.727 --> 00:38:18.262
FROM TIME TO TIME DEPENDING UPON

00:38:18.329 --> 00:38:19.664
WHETHER DEPENDING UPON.

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.399
MEASUREMENTS AND OTHER. OTHER

00:38:21.465 --> 00:38:23.501
THINGS SO WE'RE SATISFIED WITH

00:38:23.567 --> 00:38:27.438
THE WAY. THE PROCESS WORKS NOW-

00:38:27.505 --> 00:38:29.006
SOMETIMES WE'D LIKE TO SEIZE THE

00:38:29.073 --> 00:38:30.908
BIT MORE STREAMLINING IN IN THE

00:38:30.975 --> 00:38:33.310
SEQUEL AREA BUT- THIS. PURPOSE I

00:38:33.377 --> 00:38:35.546
THINK WE THINK IT'S SET UP TO DO

00:38:35.613 --> 00:38:38.716
EXACTLY WHAT. I THINK WE'RE

00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:40.484
TRYING TO DO WHICH IS IDENTIFIED

00:38:40.551 --> 00:38:41.519
THOSE. ISSUES NEED TO BE

00:38:41.585 --> 00:38:43.087
MITIGATED TO AVOID THE IMPACTS

00:38:43.154 --> 00:38:45.322
ON THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES OF.

00:38:45.389 --> 00:38:47.258
THAT'S ALL I HAVE AT THIS POINT

00:38:47.324 --> 00:38:48.726
THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO DO MR

00:38:48.793 --> 00:38:51.028
FONG I WULD I WOULD JUST LOVE

00:38:51.095 --> 00:38:51.662
IT MAYBE I'LL JUST CONCLUDE BY

00:38:51.729 --> 00:38:53.998
SAYING THAT- YOU KNOW WITH WITH

00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:54.899
TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND WITH

00:38:54.965 --> 00:38:57.234
BOTTLENECKS- YOU KNOW WE SHOULD

00:38:57.301 --> 00:38:58.669
BE INVESTING MORE RESOURCES.

00:38:58.736 --> 00:39:01.338
INTO ADDRESSING THOSE THOSE-

00:39:01.405 --> 00:39:02.540
THOSE CHALLENGES IN THOSE

00:39:02.606 --> 00:39:05.076
IMPACTS SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE

00:39:05.142 --> 00:39:06.444
EFFICIENT FLOW AND THAT WE DON'T

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:08.746
HAVE BOTTLENECKS AND CONGESTION-

00:39:08.813 --> 00:39:10.748
AND I'M MY I'M AFRAID THAT THIS

00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:12.083
BILL WOULD ACTUALLY PROHIBITS IT

00:39:12.149 --> 00:39:14.952
FUNDING. AND SO FOR THAT REASON

00:39:15.019 --> 00:39:15.786
I CAN'T SUPPORT TODAY. I

00:39:15.853 --> 00:39:17.655
APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THERE'S

00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:18.422
LOTS OF WAYS TO ADDRESS

00:39:18.489 --> 00:39:19.523
CONGESTION AT THIS AND ALWAYS

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.559
HAVE TO BE A FREEWAY EXPANSION

00:39:21.625 --> 00:39:23.327
YOU KNOW I THINK EXPLAINED THAT

00:39:23.394 --> 00:39:23.961
INCLUDING GETTING. INDIVIDUALS

00:39:24.028 --> 00:39:25.730
OUT OF OUR CARS. I IS THE WAY WE

00:39:25.796 --> 00:39:27.398
SAW IT DURING THE PANDEMIC WHO

00:39:27.465 --> 00:39:28.566
ARE NOT DRIVING OUR CARS AND THE

00:39:28.632 --> 00:39:30.901
STRIKES WERE FLOWING AT RECORD.

00:39:30.968 --> 00:39:31.469
RECORD NUMBER OF TRUCKS OR

00:39:31.535 --> 00:39:33.471
LEAVING THE PORT AND FLOWING TO

00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:34.538
THE SEVEN TEMPE WAY INTO. IT

00:39:34.605 --> 00:39:36.340
REGARDING COMMERCE. OUT THERE

00:39:36.407 --> 00:39:38.042
AND SO THERE ARE THINGS LOTS OF

00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:39.910
OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN BEST

00:39:39.977 --> 00:39:40.745
DOLLARS. THAT MIGHT MAKE MORE

00:39:40.811 --> 00:39:42.580
SENSE THAT ALLOW THE EFFICIENT

00:39:42.646 --> 00:39:44.648
MOVE OF BUSINESSMEN'S. I WANT

00:39:44.715 --> 00:39:45.382
THAT EFFICIENT MOVE A GOOD

00:39:45.449 --> 00:39:47.051
MOVEMENT THAT MEANS CLEANER AIR

00:39:47.118 --> 00:39:48.385
FOR ME WE'RE NOT JUST SITTING

00:39:48.452 --> 00:39:49.987
AROUND SECOND TRAFFIC IDOLING.

00:39:50.054 --> 00:39:52.623
AT THE OTHER DAY 75% OF MY AIR

00:39:52.690 --> 00:39:53.858
POLLUTION ISSUES IN MY BACKYARD

00:39:53.924 --> 00:39:55.459
ARE BECAUSE OF ALL THE TRUCKS

00:39:55.526 --> 00:39:56.393
THAT OFTENTIMES ARE. I DON'T

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:59.563
THINK. I'M GETTING US OUT OF OUT

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:03.167
OF THEIR WAY IT'S HELPFUL. THANK

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:05.469
YOU- JUST KIND OF WANT TO JUMP

00:40:05.536 --> 00:40:07.972
ON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. COMMENTS

00:40:08.038 --> 00:40:10.241
THERE. I SAT ON- ORANGE COUNTY

00:40:10.307 --> 00:40:11.809
TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY AND

00:40:11.876 --> 00:40:13.210
DURING MY TIME WE OBVIOUSLY

00:40:13.277 --> 00:40:14.678
APPROVED A LOT OF PROJECTS IN

00:40:14.745 --> 00:40:16.313
THESE PROJECTS DON'T JUST HAPPEN

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.982
THEY TAKE FIVE YEARS SOMETIMES

00:40:18.048 --> 00:40:19.517
TEN YEARS. SO MIKE ONE OF MY

00:40:19.583 --> 00:40:20.551
QUESTIONS AS- WHAT ABOUT THESE

00:40:20.618 --> 00:40:22.186
PROJECTS THAT ARE READY. YOU

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:23.921
KNOW. ON ON THE BOOKS BUT THEY

00:40:23.988 --> 00:40:24.855
HAVEN'T STARTED EVER BROKEN

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:26.724
GROUND. WHAT GOES WHAT HAPPENS

00:40:26.791 --> 00:40:27.958
TO THEM AND THEN ALSO IT

00:40:28.025 --> 00:40:29.393
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHERE. YOU

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.961
KNOW WHERE YOU'RE LIVING. BUT

00:40:31.028 --> 00:40:32.329
ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL. IT'S

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:34.031
SUCH IN THE STATE OF MY DISTRICT

00:40:34.098 --> 00:40:35.933
THAT I REPRESENT. WE JUST WE

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.535
DON'T REALLY HAVE AREA OF THEIR

00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:40.371
FOR. FOR TRANSIT FOR RAIL- IT

00:40:40.437 --> 00:40:41.906
IT. IS JUST NOT MADE UP THERE

00:40:41.972 --> 00:40:44.108
LIKE IT IS IN THE BIGGER CITIES

00:40:44.175 --> 00:40:45.609
LIKE THAT SO. I UNDERSTAND. THIS

00:40:45.676 --> 00:40:46.911
WOULD PROBABLY BE A GOOD PROJECT

00:40:46.977 --> 00:40:48.445
FOR WHERE YOU'RE LIVING BUT IT'S

00:40:48.512 --> 00:40:49.713
NOT ALWAYS THAT FOR EVERYONE

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.448
ELSE SO. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S

00:40:51.515 --> 00:40:53.184
WAYS OF MAKING THIS WHERE IT'S

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:54.385
BASICALLY. A REGIONAL OR ITS YOU

00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:56.187
KNOW IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE A VERY

00:40:56.253 --> 00:40:58.989
WANTS TO. YOU KNOW DO THAT THEY

00:40:59.056 --> 00:40:59.824
CAN DO IT BUT NOT PUTTING ACROSS

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.659
THE STATE BECAUSE THAT'S- WHAT

00:41:01.725 --> 00:41:02.293
HAPPENS WHEN. WE DO SOMETHING

00:41:02.359 --> 00:41:03.828
LIKE THAT IT'S NOT ALWAYS GREAT

00:41:03.894 --> 00:41:05.629
FOR EVERYBODY. BUT I THINK WHAT

00:41:05.696 --> 00:41:06.530
HAPPENS TO THOSE PROJECTS THAT

00:41:06.597 --> 00:41:07.464
ALREADY BEEN APPROVED. AND

00:41:07.531 --> 00:41:10.034
FUNDED. I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE

SENSITIVE TO BECAME. OR

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:18.509
THOUGHTFUL AND MINDFUL CREATING

00:41:18.576 --> 00:41:19.777
A PROCESS WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE

00:41:19.844 --> 00:41:22.213
TRYING TO DO AND THIS BILL INTO

THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BILL. AND

00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:03.414
AS WE PRIORITIZE MOVING PEOPLE

AND GOODS NOT JUST CARS THIS IS

00:43:05.049 --> 00:43:06.517
AN IMPORTANT STEP IN DOING THAT.

00:43:06.583 --> 00:43:08.118
OKAY A LOT OF DEVELOPED

00:43:08.185 --> 00:43:09.820

THAT I PRIORITIZE. ALMOST

00:43:13.023 --> 00:43:14.358
TRANSITION OT JUST THE CAR SO I

00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:16.226
THINK THIS IS WORTH MOVING

00:43:16.293 --> 00:43:17.361

YOU'D LIKE TO. OBTAIN THROUGH

00:43:41.318 --> 00:43:44.121

WHAT ADDITIONAL WHAT REALLY IS

00:43:50.561 --> 00:43:52.396
THE DIFFERENCE I WOULD SAY THAT

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:53.664
BY LEAVING EXAMPLE WHEN YOU CAN

00:43:53.731 --> 00:43:56.166
DISPLACE A THOUSAND LOW INCOME

00:43:56.233 --> 00:43:57.968
FAMILIES ALONG THE SEVEN TEN

00:43:58.035 --> 00:44:00.371
FREEWAY- WE HAVE A PROBLEM THE

00:44:00.437 --> 00:44:02.406
TO HEALTH IN A SECURE AREA WE

00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:03.574
KNOW THAT THAT MORE TRAFFIC JUST

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.609
BEFORE POLLUTION ALSO AND SO THE

00:44:05.676 --> 00:44:08.078
SYSTEM IS FAILING THEM WOULDN'T.

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:10.614
BUT WOULDN'T THAT. EXAMPLE BE

00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:12.649
COVERED UNDER SEQUEL NO BECAUSE

00:44:12.716 --> 00:44:14.184
YOU COULD ACTUALLY MITIGATE.

00:44:14.251 --> 00:44:15.419
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WITH

00:44:15.486 --> 00:44:16.720
ENOUGH TO BE IN THAT BACKYARD

00:44:16.787 --> 00:44:18.722
THAT YOU ARE IN THAT COMMUNITY

00:44:18.789 --> 00:44:19.890
THAT YOU ARE AFFECTING THE HAVE

00:44:19.957 --> 00:44:22.292
A SEPARATE BILL FOR THAT IF THAT

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:23.761
WERE TO PASS MAYBE IT WOULD BE

00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:24.528
COVERED SO YOU'RE YOU. YOU

00:44:24.595 --> 00:44:26.530
REALLY. DON'T WANT ANYONE. TO

00:44:26.597 --> 00:44:28.766
EVER BE DISPLACED UNDER ANY

00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:32.302
CIRCUMSTANCES I DON'T WALLOW FOR

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:34.271
A COMMUNITY FOR A FREEWAY

00:44:34.338 --> 00:44:36.807
WIDENING RICH POOR WHITE PEOPLE

00:44:36.874 --> 00:44:37.908
OF COLOR YOU DON'T WANT AYONE

00:44:37.975 --> 00:44:39.143
DISPLACED NO THIS BILL

00:44:39.209 --> 00:44:41.145
SPECIFICALLY TRYING TO FOCUS ON

00:44:41.211 --> 00:44:42.212
LOW INCOME DISADVANTAGED

00:44:42.279 --> 00:44:43.781
COMMUNITIES IT'S NOT TRYING TO

00:44:43.847 --> 00:44:45.015
SAY EVERYBODY WE ARE PRIOR IT

00:44:45.082 --> 00:44:46.583
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EQUITY AND

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.385
PROTECTING THOSE COMMUNITIES. MY

00:44:48.452 --> 00:44:54.058
POINT IS. THOSE DETAILS. SHOULD

00:44:54.124 --> 00:44:55.159
BE COVERED UNDER THE SEQUEL

00:44:55.225 --> 00:44:57.428
PROCESS. NOT WHAT YOU CAN DO IT

00:44:57.494 --> 00:44:59.296
ANYWHERE ELSE THE MITIGATION FOR

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:00.798
SECRET DOES NOT NEED TO HAPPEN

00:45:00.864 --> 00:45:02.633
IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT IS BEING

00:45:02.699 --> 00:45:04.968
AFFECTED. AND YOU DON'T WANT

00:45:05.035 --> 00:45:06.470
THAT. NOT NOT FOR NOT FOR LOW

00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:08.238
INCOME COMMUNITY THAT'S ALREADY

00:45:08.305 --> 00:45:09.473
NOT FOR A COMMUNITY THAT HAS

00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:11.175
EXTRADITION THE GENERATION AFTER

00:45:11.241 --> 00:45:13.277
GENERATION TOLD. THAT THEY ARE

00:45:13.343 --> 00:45:15.145
SACRIFICING FOR EVERYONE ELSE

00:45:15.212 --> 00:45:16.814
THIS PROGRESS THAT'S WHAT

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.182
CONTENTLY HAPPENS AND IF YOU

00:45:18.248 --> 00:45:19.550
LOOK AT THE DATA TO COMMUNITIES

00:45:19.616 --> 00:45:20.951
OF COLOR IS LOOKING COMMUNITIES

00:45:21.018 --> 00:45:22.853
THAT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. I

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.589
KEEP GETTING TOLD. THEY ARE AN

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:27.691
AFTERTHOUGHT AND SO IF I. AM ALL

00:45:27.758 --> 00:45:29.493
I'M SAYING IS THAT THEY SHOULD

00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.662
NOT BE AN AFTER THOUGHT HE WE'RE

00:45:31.728 --> 00:45:33.197
GOING TO BE WITH EQUITY. WE

00:45:33.263 --> 00:45:34.331
SHOULD BE PUTTING THAT AT THE

00:45:34.398 --> 00:45:35.399
FOREFRONT. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL

00:45:35.466 --> 00:45:37.134
TO HAVE SOME SPECIFICS ABOUT

00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:38.702
THOSE VERY FOLKS WHO WERE

00:45:38.769 --> 00:45:42.506
PROMISED SOMETHING. AND THEN THE

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:44.608
PROMISE WAS RENEGED I DON'T KNOW

00:45:44.675 --> 00:45:47.144

EQUITY ISSUES AND THERE'S BEEN A

00:46:14.071 --> 00:46:15.873
CERTAINLY A LOT OF DISCUSSION

MONEY TYPE TYPES OF PROJECTS-

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:46.797
BUT THE INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS

00:47:46.863 --> 00:47:48.332
WOULD HAVE TO BE IDENTIFIED

00:47:48.398 --> 00:47:51.301
ELSEWHERE. AND AS OF SIGNIFICANT

00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:54.304
COMMUNITY OUTREACH- EFFORT IS

00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:56.373
MADE IN THAT PROCESS AND SO

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:58.275
THOSE ARE READILY OF IT THOUGH

00:47:58.342 --> 00:47:59.843
THE LISTS ARE READILY AVAILABLE.

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:00.644
I MEAN I THINK IT'S A

00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.479

00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:11.688
HAVE CHANGED THAT THEY STILL

00:48:11.755 --> 00:48:12.789
WANT THOSE EXACT SAME PROJECTS

00:48:12.856 --> 00:48:14.825
FUNDED. WE DON'T HAVE THE

00:48:14.891 --> 00:48:16.793
ABILITY TO CHANGE THAT LIST THAT

00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.662
IS WHAT ONCE IT'S BEEN ADOPTED

00:48:18.729 --> 00:48:20.330
BY THE VOTERS THAT IS WHAT THE

00:48:20.397 --> 00:48:22.299
LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ARE. ALSO WE

00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:24.134
HAVE BONDED AGAINST THOSE

00:48:24.201 --> 00:48:25.702

00:48:25.769 --> 00:48:27.704
OBLIGATIONS WITH- WITH BOND

00:48:27.771 --> 00:48:29.172
HOLDERS ON THOSE PROJECTS AS

00:48:29.239 --> 00:48:31.842
WELL. FOR THE VERY SPECIFIC

00:48:31.908 --> 00:48:34.645
PROJECT FOR INSTANCE HE- LANE

00:48:34.711 --> 00:48:37.481
ADDING ON A HIGHWAY OR IS IT

00:48:37.547 --> 00:48:38.882
MORE OPEN ENDED THAN THAT

00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:40.717
CONGESTION RELIEF FOR INSTANCE I

00:48:40.784 --> 00:48:41.585

00:48:43.787 --> 00:48:44.354
SPECIFICALLY HOW IDENTIFIED TO

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:46.423
THE BOND HOUSE OKAY YEAH I'D BE

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:47.891
CURIOUS. TO FIND THAT OUT AS I'M

00:48:47.958 --> 00:48:50.961
LEARNING. THIS ROLE SO THANK YOU

00:48:51.028 --> 00:48:53.063
. SO YOU KNOW IT. THERE WAS A

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:55.132
TIME WHEN WE THOUGHT THAT IF

00:48:55.198 --> 00:48:56.633
THERE WAS A FREEWAY THAT WAS

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:57.601
CONGESTED IF WE WOULD JUST ADD A

00:48:57.668 --> 00:49:00.537
LANE ALL OF A SUDDEN IT WOULD-

00:49:00.604 --> 00:49:02.306
INCREASING THE FLOW ABILITY OF

00:49:02.372 --> 00:49:04.107
THE TRAFFIC CAN DECREASE

00:49:04.174 --> 00:49:04.741
CONGESTION AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN

00:49:04.808 --> 00:49:06.543
OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THAT

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:08.211
THAT'S USUALLY NOT THE CASE THAT

00:49:08.278 --> 00:49:09.579
INSTEAD WHEN YOU HAD THE

00:49:09.646 --> 00:49:10.647
CAPACITY TO. GET MORE DRIVERS

00:49:10.714 --> 00:49:12.182
AND YOU GET YOU INVITE MORE

00:49:12.249 --> 00:49:13.784
DRIVERS ON THE ROAD IN THE ROAD

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:15.819
BECOMES JUST AS IF NOT MORE

00:49:15.886 --> 00:49:16.486
CONGESTED- AND WE SEE THE

00:49:16.553 --> 00:49:18.522
IMPACTS OF DOING EXACTLY THAT

00:49:18.588 --> 00:49:20.557
KIND OF WORK ON COMMUNITIES ON

00:49:20.624 --> 00:49:22.025
AIR QUALITY AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

00:49:22.092 --> 00:49:23.960
AND THE AUTHORS IS SPOT ON THAT

00:49:24.027 --> 00:49:25.996
THERE IS A BETTER WAY. AND IT'S

00:49:26.063 --> 00:49:27.397
A WAY THAT PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA

00:49:27.464 --> 00:49:29.166
HAVE SAID THAT THEY WANT WHICH

00:49:29.232 --> 00:49:31.868
IS MORE MOBILITY OPTIONS- AND

00:49:31.935 --> 00:49:33.837
LESS CONGESTION. SO I THINK THAT

00:49:33.904 --> 00:49:35.405
THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT TO WORK

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:37.908
OUT AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD-

00:49:37.974 --> 00:49:39.810

CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU. I GET THE

01:36:02.456 --> 01:36:05.092
CONCEPT OF SWITCHING TO IF YOUR

01:36:05.159 --> 01:36:06.694
GOALS REDUCE EMISSIONS IT SEEMS

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.062
LIKE INCENTIVIZING PEOPLE THAT

01:36:08.129 --> 01:36:10.264
DRIVE THE MOST. CONSUME THE MOST

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:12.666
GAS. IS AN EFFICIENT WAY TO

01:36:12.733 --> 01:36:14.702
ACCOMPLISH CYCLE. THE MY

01:36:14.768 --> 01:36:16.737
QUESTION IS HOW DOES THIS CHANGE

01:36:16.804 --> 01:36:18.672
THE STATUS QUO WHAT WHAT WHAT IS

01:36:18.739 --> 01:36:20.741
SHIFTED AROUND I'VE LOST TRACK

01:36:20.808 --> 01:36:21.742
OF EXACTLY HOW WE'RE-

01:36:21.809 --> 01:36:23.711
INCENTIVIZING SETS PRESENTLY I

01:36:23.777 --> 01:36:24.845
THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO

01:36:24.912 --> 01:36:26.614
WE ALSO WE WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.315
NOT JUST TO DO THAT BUT ALSO TO-

01:36:28.382 --> 01:36:30.384
FACTOR IN INCOME. SO THE STATUS

01:36:30.451 --> 01:36:32.353
QUO NOW IS TO CLEAN CARS FOR ALL

01:36:32.419 --> 01:36:34.688
WHICH IS THE- ONES TARGETING

01:36:34.755 --> 01:36:36.590
LOWER INCOME FAMILIES ARE THE

01:36:36.657 --> 01:36:38.726
ONES. THAT ARE YOU IF YOU HAVE

01:36:38.792 --> 01:36:40.961
LIKE A GAS GUZZLER WILL TRY TO

01:36:41.028 --> 01:36:42.863
GET TRY TO GAS GUZZLER INTO A

01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:43.764
CLEANER CAR. BUT THAT IS JUST

01:36:43.831 --> 01:36:45.366
TARGETING LOWER INCOME FAMILIES

01:36:45.432 --> 01:36:47.735
WHAT WE SAY IS BUT WE ALSO WANT

01:36:47.801 --> 01:36:48.602
TO FACTORY AND WE THINK YOU

01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:50.671
SHOULD HAVE A LARGER IS CENTER

01:36:50.738 --> 01:36:52.106
FOR STATE FOR CLEAN CARS FOR

01:36:52.173 --> 01:36:53.440
ALL- IF YOU ARE. DRIVING FURTHER

01:36:53.507 --> 01:36:54.808
YOU'RE USING MORE GASOLINE NOW

01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:56.210
THERE'S A CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE

01:36:56.277 --> 01:36:57.912
PROGRAM WHICH THE INCOME HAS

01:36:57.978 --> 01:37:00.281
JUST RECENTLY DROPPED SO- YOU

01:37:00.347 --> 01:37:02.483
COULD CALL IT MORE OF A MIDDLE

01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:04.718
INCOME- PROPOSAL WHICH IS JUST

01:37:04.785 --> 01:37:06.954
FOR NEW. CLEAN CARS SAME THING

01:37:07.021 --> 01:37:10.424
SO IF YOU IN OVER SO I WENT

01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:11.625
FROM. IF YOU GO FROM YOU KNOW

01:37:11.692 --> 01:37:13.394
ELECTRACARD ANOTHER LECTURE CARP

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:15.563
INSTEAD OF A PART BE THE SAME

01:37:15.629 --> 01:37:17.431
BUT IF YOU'RE GOING FROM A GAS

01:37:17.498 --> 01:37:18.766
CAR YOU'RE DRIVING A LOT OF GAS

01:37:18.832 --> 01:37:20.568
YOU'RE USING A LOT OF GAS. THAT

01:37:20.634 --> 01:37:21.702
INCENTIVE WOULD BE HIGHER SO

01:37:21.769 --> 01:37:22.636
IT'S REALLY TRYING TO. JUST

01:37:22.703 --> 01:37:23.938
REALLY QUICK LITTLE MORE FOCUS

01:37:24.004 --> 01:37:25.773
AROUND THAT INSTEAD OF IT IN A

01:37:25.839 --> 01:37:27.541
PERFECT WORLD WE WOULD ACTUALLY

01:37:27.608 --> 01:37:29.310
REALLY PROBABLY HAVE. ONE

01:37:29.376 --> 01:37:31.245
INCENTIVE PROGRAM RATHER THAN.

01:37:31.312 --> 01:37:33.314
YOU KNOW A NEW PROGRAM FOR ALL

01:37:33.380 --> 01:37:39.787
THESE THINGS- BUT THAT'S NOT THE

01:37:39.853 --> 01:37:41.355
WORLD THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW.

01:37:41.422 --> 01:37:43.023
THANKS MY ONLY UP. IS THERE A

01:37:43.090 --> 01:37:44.091
SORT OF DIFFERENCE IN HOW UNDER

01:37:44.158 --> 01:37:46.026
THIS BILL HOW BUSINESS USE

01:37:46.093 --> 01:37:46.860
VEHICLES TO BE TREATED VERSUS

01:37:46.927 --> 01:37:48.529
PERSONAL USE VEHICLES THE REASON

01:37:48.596 --> 01:37:51.031
I ASK IS THAT THAT CAME UP IN

01:37:51.098 --> 01:37:51.932
THE NEWS ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S

01:37:51.999 --> 01:37:53.734
PROPOSED REBATE WHICH I JUST

01:37:53.801 --> 01:37:55.469
THINK ABOUT MY DISTRICT I DRIVE

01:37:55.536 --> 01:37:57.671
AROUND. IN IT ALL THE TIME LIKE

01:37:57.738 --> 01:37:59.773
WE ALL DO OVER A HOMES BIG THROW

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:01.709
YOU DRIVE A LOT THERE EVERYBODY

01:38:01.775 --> 01:38:02.643
DOES THERE'S NOBODY YOU SEE

01:38:02.710 --> 01:38:03.677
DRIVING MORE THAN LIKE A

01:38:03.744 --> 01:38:06.580
LANDSCAPER RIGHT AND IF THAT

01:38:06.647 --> 01:38:08.415
PERSON. THE WORD INCENTIVIZE IN

01:38:08.482 --> 01:38:10.150
A- YOU KNOW SMALLER TRUCKS TO

01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:11.885
INTENDED BE WHAT THEY DRIVE BUT

01:38:11.952 --> 01:38:13.487
IF THEY WERE INCENTIVIZED TO

01:38:13.554 --> 01:38:14.588
SWITCH TO OBSERVE I COULD SEE

01:38:14.655 --> 01:38:16.223
TREMENDOUS SAVINGS FOR THEM THE

01:38:16.290 --> 01:38:18.025
NUMBER. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

01:38:18.092 --> 01:38:18.659
WE'RE NOT. CARVING THEM OUT IN

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:20.461
SOME WAY AND IMPORTANTLY BECAUSE

01:38:20.527 --> 01:38:21.695
THEY MAY HAVE THAT BUSINESS

01:38:21.762 --> 01:38:24.565
THERE THAT THAT DIFFICULT MAY BE

01:38:24.632 --> 01:38:25.666
REGISTERED AS A BUSINESS USED

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:27.835
VEHICLE. I'M I'M DONE GO INTO

01:38:27.901 --> 01:38:29.536
THAT SO- I NONPROFIT HAS BEEN

01:38:29.603 --> 01:38:30.938
DOING SOME RESEARCH AND YOU'RE

01:38:31.005 --> 01:38:33.741
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE ARE SOME-

01:38:33.807 --> 01:38:35.776
LEAD VEHICLES. THAT ARE USING

01:38:35.843 --> 01:38:37.811
FAR DISPROPORTIONATELY YOU KNOW

01:38:37.878 --> 01:38:40.381
LARGER AMOUNTS OF GASOLINE. AND

01:38:40.447 --> 01:38:42.583
THOSE SHOUD BE FOCUSED ON THIS.

01:38:42.650 --> 01:38:45.085
BILL APPLIES TO PRIVATE VEHICLE

01:38:45.152 --> 01:38:46.920
EVEY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS BUT I

01:38:46.987 --> 01:38:48.489
THINK YOU MAKE A GREAT POINT

01:38:48.555 --> 01:38:50.624
THAT IT WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD

01:38:50.691 --> 01:38:51.825
IDEA TO INCENTIVIZE THOSE USING

01:38:51.892 --> 01:38:52.860
THE MOST GASOLINE AND OTHER. FOR

01:38:52.926 --> 01:38:54.795
OTHER TYPES OF VEHICLES TO ALSO

01:38:54.862 --> 01:38:56.797
SWITCH FIRST. IT THE PART THE

01:38:56.864 --> 01:38:58.499
REASON WE HADN'T FOCUSED THERE

01:38:58.565 --> 01:39:00.968
ARE MUCH IS. YOU ONLY HAD SEDANS

01:39:01.035 --> 01:39:02.970
THAT WERE ELECTRIC VEHICLES VERY

01:39:03.037 --> 01:39:04.805
FEW S. U. V. OPTIONS WERE NOW

01:39:04.872 --> 01:39:06.340
STARTED SEE I MEAN A LANDSCAPER

01:39:06.407 --> 01:39:08.108
COULD REALLY DO IT BECAUSE THERE

01:39:08.175 --> 01:39:09.410
AREN'T ANY PICKUP TRUCKS. NOW

01:39:09.476 --> 01:39:10.878
THAT THERE ARE PICKUP TRUCKS YOU

01:39:10.944 --> 01:39:11.512
CAN POLICIES I THINK. THAT'S

01:39:11.578 --> 01:39:13.580
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN START

01:39:13.647 --> 01:39:14.381
THINKING ABOUT FOR SURE BUT THIS

01:39:14.448 --> 01:39:16.984
DOESN'T. CHANGE ISN'T CHANGE THE

01:39:17.051 --> 01:39:18.552
STRUCTURE OF ANY OF THE- CENTER

01:39:18.619 --> 01:39:20.854
PROGRAMS OUTSIDE OF JUST. ASKING

01:39:20.921 --> 01:39:22.890
THEM TO FOCUS MORE ON. WHO THE

01:39:22.956 --> 01:39:26.493
USERS ARE AND WHO'S WHO THE

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:27.795

SMALLER THAN HIS IT'S PROBABLY

01:39:44.945 --> 01:39:47.214
ONLY ABOUT TEN SQUARE MILES BUT

01:39:47.281 --> 01:39:49.416
WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHO DRIVES AT

01:39:49.483 --> 01:39:50.451

SPACE- I'VE SPOKEN TO SOME

01:41:57.277 --> 01:41:59.513
GROUPS. IN SOME AREAS WHO SAY

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:00.914
THAT IT'S THE LACK OF CHARGING

01:42:00.981 --> 01:42:02.082
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THEIR AREA

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:03.450

COLLISION DATA IS AN IMPORTANT

02:19:01.299 --> 02:19:02.634
WAY THAT WE CAN USE TO DETERMINE

02:19:02.701 --> 02:19:04.069
WHERE WILDLIFE CROSSING SHOULD

02:19:04.135 --> 02:19:05.670
