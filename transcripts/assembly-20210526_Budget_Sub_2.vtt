HERE- AND THEY GET MOST BECAUSE-

01:10:13.108 --> 01:10:13.909
CHANGES I THINK WE ARE

01:10:13.976 --> 01:10:22.785
PROPOSING- IT WITH REGARD TO

01:10:22.851 --> 01:10:24.687
STATE PRESCHOOL AND UNIVERSAL

01:10:24.753 --> 01:10:28.591
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN- I DO

01:10:28.657 --> 01:10:29.792
THINK WE NEED TO OBVIOUSLY WE

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:32.027
NEEDED WE NEED TO PUT IN HERE

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:34.830
THE RATE REFORM. PORTION I DO

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:35.397
THINK WE NEED TO BE THINKING

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:38.167
ABOUT. IT'S NICE OF THEM

01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:40.469
PROPOSING TO VOTE AGAINST THIS

01:10:40.536 --> 01:10:42.371
BUT WOULD YOU BE THINKING ABOUT.

01:10:42.438 --> 01:10:43.672
TRANSITIONING I THINK FROM OUR

01:10:43.739 --> 01:10:46.809
AMAR TO A MORE STANDARDIZED.

01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:50.879
RATES BECAUSE IN THE LONG TERM

01:10:50.946 --> 01:10:51.947
WE CAN GET TO AN UNEQUAL

01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:54.817
POSITION- AGAIN DEPENDING ON

01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:57.519
YOUR REGION- IF WE'RE BASING

01:10:57.586 --> 01:11:00.055
IT. JUST ON RMR AND SO I MEAN

01:11:00.122 --> 01:11:01.156
THAT'S ONE THING I'D FLAG IS

01:11:01.223 --> 01:11:02.725
THAT WE MAY WANT SOME

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:05.527
FLEXIBILITY. INTO THE FUTURE TO

01:11:05.594 --> 01:11:09.264
GO TO A MORE STANDARD- RATE

01:11:09.331 --> 01:11:10.766
SYSTEM BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS IS AN

01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:12.401
IMPROVEMENT ON WHAT WE'VE GOT.

01:11:12.468 --> 01:11:14.503
RIGHT NOW- SO THAT WAS JUST ONE

01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:16.972
THING I WANTED TO. MENTION ON

01:11:17.039 --> 01:11:21.777
THIS- ON RE OPENING PUBLIC

01:11:21.844 --> 01:11:24.179
SCHOOLS THAT PORTION- IT'S HARD

01:11:24.246 --> 01:11:25.714
FOR ME TO VOTE ON THAT SECTION

01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:27.483
AT THIS POINT IN TIME BECAUSE

01:11:27.549 --> 01:11:28.717
YOU REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY.

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:30.019
LANGUAGE CAN HAVE PLACEHOLDER

01:11:30.085 --> 01:11:32.888
LANGUAGE. SO I WOULD HAVE CRIED

01:11:32.955 --> 01:11:34.957
AS MAYBE A STAIN ON THAT ITEM

01:11:35.024 --> 01:11:38.861
NUMBER- I THINK WE'VE

01:11:38.927 --> 01:11:40.829
HIGHLIGHTED VERY CLEARLY THAT

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:41.797
THERE'S SOME PROBLEMS- MAYBE

01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:44.633
THE MOST THE POSTER CHILD FOR

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.702
THIS IS SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED-

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:48.804

WAYS IS KIND OF PUTS THEM AT A

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:09.858
DISADVANTAGE- MANY OF THOSE

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:10.926
SCHOOLS HAD TRANSPORTATION

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:13.562

ASSOCIATED WITH YOU KNOW MAKING

01:12:15.264 --> 01:12:17.633
THE EFFORT THE REAL EFFORT TO
