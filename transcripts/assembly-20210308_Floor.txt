THIS IS ASSEMBLY THIRD READING. THIS IS ASSEMBLY THIRD READING FILE ITEM NUMBER. ONE ACR THIRTY EIGHT MEMBERS. THIS IS ACR THIRTY EIGHT THE CORPORATION ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION THIRTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLANCA RUBIO RELATIVE TO SCHOOL NUTRITION PROGRAMS MISS RUBIO ON THE RESOLUTION. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES I RISE TO REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT ON ACR THIRTY EIGHT TO DECLARE MARCH EIGHTH THROUGH THE TWELFTH SCHOOL BREAKFAST WEEK IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN I WAS A TEACHER I REGULARLY SAW STUDENTS COMING TO SCHOOL WITHOUT FOOD IN THEIR BELLIES. WHICH MADE IT EVEN HARDER FOR THEM TO CONCENTRATE IN CLASS AND LEARN. FOR MANY OF THESE STUDENTS A FREE BREAKFAST OR LUNCH AT SCHOOL WAS THE MOST RELIABLE MEAL THEY HAD. AS WE ALL KNOW. SCHOOL MEALS TOOK A VERY DIFFERENT LOOK VERY DIFFERENT IN THE PANDEMIC. EXPERTS SAY THAT TWO POINT TWO MILLION CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA COULD BE FACING HUNGER AS A RESULT OF COVERT NINETEEN. THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC SCHOOL NUTRITION WORKERS HAVE CONTINUED SERVING MILLIONS OF MEALS TO STUDENTS ALL ACROSS THE STATE EVEN IF KIDS HAVE BEEN LEARNING FROM HOME. THESE CALL THE CHRISTIAN WORKERS ARE AMONG THE MANY ESSENTIAL HEROES OF THE PART OF IT OF THIS PANDEMIC. AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN SUPPORTING STUDENTS SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND ACADEMIC CAL AS THEY TRANSITION BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM. THANK YOU. EATING SCHOOL BREAKFAST IS ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVE STUDENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IT'S ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH A LOWER PROBABILITY OF THE CITY WHICH CAN CONTRIBUTE TO MANY OTHER HEALTH RELATED PROBLEMS. I HOPE THAT WITH THIS RESOLUTION WE CAN BOTH RIGHT. WE CAN RISE- WHAT WE CAN RAISE AWARENESS OF SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAMS AND TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE THE INVALUABLE SERVICES OF SCHOOL NUTRITION STAFF WHO HAVE WORKED TIRELESSLY TO SERVE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN THE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC.

THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER WANT TO STAND RISE IN SUPPORT OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM BALDWIN PARK FOR BRINGING THIS VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY TIMELY ISSUE FORWARD- COLLEAGUES BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. ABOUT 11% OF OUR CHILDREN SCHOOL CHILDREN WE'RE DEALING WITH HUNGER. SINCE THE PANDEMIC THIS IS BASED ON SURVEYS DATING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN DATING BACK ONLY TWO YEARS AGO. LESS THAN TWO YEARS AGO. TODAY 25% OF OUR CHILDREN FACE FOOD INSECURITY MALNUTRITION WHICH AS YOU ALL KNOW LEADS TO A LIFE OF SEVERE COST HEALTH CARE RELATED COSTS WHICH IS GONNA BE SHOULDERED BY THE STATE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SO IT'S CRITICAL FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE'RE SPENDING TO RISE.
