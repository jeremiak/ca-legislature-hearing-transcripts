NOW MOVING ON TO SEND ITS THIRD READING FILE FIRST UP IS FALL ITEM NINETEEN. SENATOR SCANNER YOU PREPARED. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE RATE SENATE RESOLUTION SEVENTY FIVE BY SENATOR SKINNER RELATIVE TO WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH. SENATOR SKINNER FOR YOURS. THANK YOU SO MUCH- MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS S. R. SEVENTY FIVE RECOGNIZES MARCH TWENTY TWENTY TWO AS WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH CONGRESS FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH IN MARCH OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN. HOW MANY TIMES IN FLOOR REMARKS AROUND A RESOLUTION LIKE THIS AND I WILL REMIND US THAT WE HAVE TAKEN UP THIS RESOLUTION- EVERY YEAR FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. THERE IS OFTEN THE RESEARCH RECITATION. OF MANY WOMEN THROUGHOUT HISTORY WOMEN THAT MIGHT EVEN BE OBSCURED SOME OF US WHO HAVE ACCOMPLISHED PHENOMENAL THINGS WHETHER IN INDUSTRY ATHLETICS INNOVATION THE LAW YOU NAME IT. BUT I HAVE NEVER LIKED HAVING TO SPEAK THROUGH. BRING OUT IN PARTICULAR. FEATS OF WOMEN BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME IT SHOULD BE OBVIOUS TO ALL OF US. AND IF WE DO NOT HAVE. FIFTY OR SIXTY WOMEN IN OUR MINDS THAT WE CAN IMMEDIATELY BRING TO MIND THAT HAVE DONE THIS PHENOMENAL THING SAYS THE FIFTY OR SIXTY MEN THAT MIGHT COME TO OUR MINDS THEN I URGE YOU TO DO SO BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE THAN ABUNDANT. AND YET THESE THIRTY FIVE YEARS LATER SINCE CONGRESS DESIGNATED WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH I NOTICED WHILE WE HAVE BLACK HISTORY MONTH SO MANY OTHER HISTORY MONTHS WE HAVE NO MEN THIS THREE MONTH. BUT ANYWAY ALL THESE THREE YEARS THIRTY FIVE YEARS LATER THE VALUE OF WOMEN IS STILL OVERLOOKED WOMEN ARE STILL PAID LESS THAN MEN. EIGHTY THREE CENTS TO THE DOLLAR AND IF YOU ARE A WOMAN OF COLOR THAT DOT THAT AMOUNT DROPS FURTHER. WORK IS CARE GIVERS WHICH STILL IN OUR SOCIETY FALLS PRIMARILY TO WOMEN. GOES UNPAID AND UNRECOGNISED AND IF THEY ARE PAID THE WAGES ARE ALWAYS BEHIND OTHER CATEGORIES OF EMPLOYMENT AND FALL WELL BEHIND THE RISING COST OF WOMEN. AND OF COURSE WE ARE FACING THE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE MEN ARE STILL NOT PROTECTED UNDER THE CONSTITUTION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF SEX. NOW THE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THE THIRTY EIGHT STATES. RATIFY AN AMENDMENT FOR IT TO BE AN AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION. THE ERA THE EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT NOW HAS THIRTY EIGHT STATES WHO HAVE RATIFIED IT. SO WHY ISN'T IT ALREADY PUBLISHED IN OUR CONSTITUTION BECAUSE OF AN ARBITRARY DEADLINE THAT THE CONGRESS PASSED. THERE'S NOTHING IN THE CONSTITUTION THAT PUTS A DEADLINE ON THE RATIFICATION OF AMENDMENT AND IN FACT THERE'S AT LEAST ONE AMENDMENT THAT TOOK OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS TO RATIFY WOMEN ARE STILL UNDERREPRESENTED IN BOARD ROOMS. THE EX C. SUITE. THE ELECTED OFFICE AND INCLUDE IN INCLUDING IN THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY. BOTH HOUSES WERE DOING BETTER BUT WE GOT A LONG WAY TO GO. AND ALL OF THESE DISCREPANCIES ARE FAR MORE GLARING FOR WOMEN OF COLOR. SO I'M PROUD TO BRING THIS RESOLUTION FORD AS VICE CHAIR OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. AND AS WE USUALLY DO PRE PANDEMIC WE HAVE OUR FLOOR RECOGNITION OF WOMEN OF THE YEAR THAT EACH OF THE MEMBERS RECOGNIZED BUT DUE TO THE PANDEMIC WE'VE NOT DONE THAT FOR SOME YEARS. BUT WE KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE. I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO ORDER A WOMAN IN YOUR DISTRICT AND HAVE RECEIVED CERTIFICATES AND SUCH TO PROVIDE THOSE WOMEN. ALL OF THE SENATE. LET'S SET OF WOMEN'S CAUCUS MEMBERS ARE CO AUTHORS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM SENATOR ALSO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT.

NATIONALLY WE LOOK AT THE OTHER PROUD LET. LIKE JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR YOUR ASTRONAUT ELLEN OCHOA AN ACTRESS THE MORE THAN. ALL OF WHICH ARE TRAIL BLAZERS AND THE RESPECT RESPECTIVE FIELDS AND THEY INSPIRE FUTURE GENERATIONS OF LATINO LEADERS. BUT THERE ARE OTHER INSPIRATIONAL LEADERS WHO ARE OVERLOOKED ESSENTIAL WORKERS THEY KEEP OUR ECONOMY RUNNING DURING THE PANDEMIC. FARM WORKERS PUT FOOD ON OUR TABLES. WOMEN ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY THE LATINO CAUCUS CELEBRATES MANY OF THESE CHAMPIONS EACH YEAR NON LATINO SPIRIT OF WORDS BUT MANY MANY MORE AND TOO MANY ARE STILL ON SCENE PLEASE JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING THIS RESOLUTION HONORING ALL WOMEN WHO HELPED WITH THIS EXTRAORDINARY TAPESTRY WE CALL AMERICA THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR RAZA.
