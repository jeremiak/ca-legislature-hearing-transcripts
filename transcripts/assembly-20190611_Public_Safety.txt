POSSIBLE IN BECAUSE WE'RE RICH AT A GROUP WILL ASK YOU QUESTIONS OKAY VERY GOOD WELL I WOULD JUST SAY THAT I THINK THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BILL CHANGING ONE WORD. FROM SHOULD TO SHALL WE KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN PERMISSIVE FOR MANY YEARS AND THAT HAS NOT WORKED SO CHANGING ONE WORD THE WORD SHALL WILL MEAN THAT IT HAS TO BE DONE RIGHT KIDS HAVE TO BE TESTED. WE KNOW THAT DNA SOLVES CRIMES IT EITHER PUTS THE BAD GUYS AWAY OR EXONERATES THE GOOD GUYS SO I WILL RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE I HAVE TWO WONDERFUL WITNESSES IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM THEM. IF NOT. IT'S THAT YOUR COMMITTEE MISTER CHAIR YES -- IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS YOU'VE THIS IS THE A O'MALLEY YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES TO DO MELLY VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS COMMITTEE OKAY. YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE ALL FIVE MEN I I PROMISE I WILL NOT BECAUSE I'M SURE THAT I COULD NOT SAY IT BETTER THAN SENATOR LEYVA -- BUT I WILL SAY THAT THIS IS A MATTER THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS WITH A WITH YOUR LEGISLATURE. AND WE HAVE A IT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHEN SENATOR SKINNER WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY. THAT BILL WAS PASSED AND WOULD BE WE COULD ONLY GET IT PASSED BY CALLING LIKE USING THE WORD SHOULD -- AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS EVEN WITH THAT SHOULD INSTEAD OF SHALL THAT THERE WERE MANY POLICE AGENCIES. SIX STILL DID NOT SUBMIT KIDS FROM THEIR EVIDENCE ROOM TO BE TESTED FOR DNA. AND SO THIS BILL IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT. IT'S TIME THAT WE PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF ALL SURVIVORS AND PROTECT PEOPLE ALSO WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSED BY. IDENTIFICATION IN THE DNA EXONERATE SINCE IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER EVANS FROM JOYFUL HEART -- GOOD MORNING CHAIRS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE -- FIRST THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF TESTING RATE CAPS IN CALIFORNIA. I'M AMANDA STEVENS -- A BOARD MEMBER THE JOYFUL HEART FOUNDATION AND A RESIDENT OF THIS GREAT STATE. JOYFUL HEART WAS FOUNDED BY LAW AND ORDER ACTORS AN ADVOCATE MORISCO HARGETT TODAY AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND TEN WE MADE ELIMINATING THE RIGHT KICK BACK LOG OUR TOP ADVOCACY PRIORITY. JOYFUL HEART IS A PROUD SPONSOR OF SB TWENTY TWO WHICH WOULD REQUIRE TESTING OF ALL RIGHT KIDS. IT WILL ALSO MAKE CALIFORNIA A SAFER. EVERY NINETY TWO SECONDS SOMEONE IS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED IN AMERICA. AFTER AN ASSAULT LIKELY THE MOST TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE OF THEIR LIFE. SOME SURVIVORS GET THEMSELVES TO A HOSPITAL INSTEAD OF TAKING A SHOWER. THE FIRST THING MANY WANT TO DO. THEY MAY WAIT FOR HOURS BEFORE THEN GOING THROUGH A FOUR TO SIX OUR THOROUGH INVASIVE AND UNCOMFORTABLE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION TO COLLECT DNA. THEY EXPECT THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL BE USED TO IDENTIFY AND PROSECUTE THE PERPETRATORS. THE PUBLIC EXPECTS THE SAME. THEY ARE RIGHT TO THINK SO. DNA EVIDENCE CONTAINED IN RIGHT KIDS IS A POWERFUL TOOL TO SOLVE AND PREVENT CRIME. WHEN TESTED IT CAN IDENTIFY UNKNOWN OFFENDERS AND LINK CRIMES TOGETHER REVEALING SERIAL RAPIST? TESTING IN DETROIT OF TEN THOUSAND KIDS HAS UNCOVERED MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED SERIAL RAPIST WHO HAVE COMMITTED ALL KINDS OF CRIMES AND FORTY OTHER STATES AND DC. IN CLEVELAND POLICE HAVE IDENTIFIED MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED SERIAL OFFENDERS OUT OF FIVE THOUSAND KIDS. MANY OF THESE OFFENDERS HAVE NOW BEEN FOUND GUILTY AND TAKEN OFF THE STREETS. HERE IN CALIFORNIA KEITH ASBURY JUNIOR OF ANTIOCH SEXUALLY ASSAULTED AT LEAST FIVE WOMEN. OVER NINE YEARS EVENTUALLY MURDERING ONE OF HIS VICTIMS. ACCORDING TO PROSECUTORS AS VERY KIDNAPPED AND RAPED TWO YOUNG WOMEN IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD AND A NINETEEN YEAR OLD. THE RAPE KITS COLLECTED FROM THESE VICTIMS SAT UNTESTED FOR YEARS. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN HE ATTEMPTED RAPE OF A FORTY SIX YEAR OLD WOMAN AND A FEW WEEKS LATER. BURGLARIZED A HOME. RAPING AND MURDERING A THIRTY SEVEN YEAR OLD STUDENT. SEVERAL OF THESE CRIMES COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED WITH THE TIMELY TESTING OF A SINGLE RIGHT GET BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT ALAMEDA COUNTY DA O'MALLEY FOR TESTING THE RAPE KITS IN THESE CASES. CRIMINALS DON'T STOP UNLESS WE MAKE THEM STOP. RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA DESPITE ALL THE PROOF THAT TESTING RIGHT KIDS AS BEST PRACTICE. WHETHER OR NOT A RAPE KIT GETS TESTED DEPENDS ON THE SURVIVORS ZIP CODE WHETHER OR NOT THAT JURISDICTION TESTS. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW SAYS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD SEND KIDS FOR TESTING THIS WAS A WELL INTENTIONED LAW BUT ISN'T WORKING. JOYFUL HEARTS ACCOUNTABILITY PROJECT HAS ISSUED OPEN RECORDS REQUESTS TO EIGHT JURISDICTIONS AND FOUND THAT SIX OUT OF THE THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE LAW. OR HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING HOW MANY KIDS THEY ARE RECEIVING. BY PASSING SB TWENTY TWO AND CHANGING THE SHOULD TO SHALL. CALIFORNIA WILL TAKE DANGEROUS VIOLENT OFFENDERS OFF THE STREET. IT WILL DEMONSTRATE A COMMITMENT TO SURVIVORS TO HELP THEM FIND A PATH TO HEALING AND JUSTICE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH YOU TO PASS THIS MUCH NEEDED LEGISLATION. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GAIL STORED ON BEHALF OF THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUMMER STAFF AN IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU.

QUIRK I SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO AYE WICKS. THAT MOTION PAT YEAR YOUR BILL WITHOUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU. NOW WE HAVE MISTER BOB HERTZBERG. ITEM NUMBER SEVEN SB ONE NINE TWO POSSE COMITATUS. I THINK YOU JUST WANT TO SAY POLICY COMMITTEE. PASS A COMITATUS PARTIS OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY I KNOW YOU WERE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE AT THAT TIME NOT DETERMINED. I DON'T WANT TO BE INSULTED BUT BRIEFLY. THANK YOU MORE BRIEFLY. WE ALL PASSED THESE LAWS THAT I HEAR FROM FOLKS THAT I REPRESENT REYES COMMUNITIES YOU FOLKS UP THERE ARE WAS PASSED LAWS ALL THE TIME WHAT YOU TAKE SOME OFF THE BOOKS. SO WHY DO WE SCOURED ALL TWENTY NINE CODES OF THE STATE TO CALIFORNIA AND FOUND ALL KINDS OF CRAZY LAWS. LAWS THE TALKED ABOUT HOW BIGGEST SUNGLASSES WOMEN CAN WEAR WHETHER DRIVING CARS GLASSES THE IDEA IS. LAWS THE TALK ABOUT OF AND THE MOVING FORMA. RIVER WALK DEFORMED WOODEN BARGE TO A BOAT STEAM BOATS AND ALL THIS CRAZY STUFF BUT AS I KEPT DRILL AND DRILL AND EVERYWHERE I WENT I WAS FOUND A REASON FOR THE LAW WAS SOMEONE WOULD COME IN. AND TELL YOU -- YOU CAN'T REMOVE THAT FROM THE BOOKS. AND SO I FIGURED A LAW THAT WAS ENCOURAGED BY THE SLAVE TRADE IN. OF IN PUTTING PEOPLE IN JAIL IF THEY DON'T RESPOND TO ONE OF POLICE OFF -- A SHERIFF ASKED THEM TO JOIN THE POSSE COMITATUS THAT MAYBE THERE WOULD BE NO OPPOSITION NOW I'M TOLD THAT THE SHERIFF'S HAD SOME ISSUE ON THIS BUT WE CALL THEM BACK IN MARCH NO ONE EVER RESPONDED. WE HAVEN'T FOUND ANY LAWS ON THE BOOKS WHICH BEEN USED AND THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS YOU KNOW. EVEN THOUGH WE'RE REPEAL IN THIS LAW THERE ARE A WHOLE HOST OF LAWS THROUGHOUT OUR CODES. THAT IN THAT THAT REQUIRE PEOPLE TO ACT IN GOOD FAITH TO HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE THEY FIND THEMSELVES IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE -- ET WHERE SHERIFF IF IF THEY ASK YOU THEY CAN ASK YOU FOR SUPPORT THE IT REFERRING TO POLICE OFFICERS THE PENAL CODE PUBLIC OFFICERS TO EXECUTE PROCESS. A NOR ALSO IN THE PENAL CODE OF PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE SOME BELIEVE ASKED HELP OPEN DISPERSED GOOD FAITH THE REST ALL OF THOSE THINGS BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE YOUR CRIMINAL. IF YOU DON'T JOIN UP AND WE FIGURED THIS IS ONE WE THINK WE CAN TAKE OFF THE BOOKS THE INTERNS MY TRUSTY YOUNG A IT LAWYER FROM BERKELEY. THESE CALL BOTH PAUL BUT IT'S NOW BERKELEY LAW SCHOOL IS USING OLD THE A AND HE'D FOUND THIS LAW TO HELP US DO THIS SO I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THOSE FEW TIMES WE CAN TAKE A LOT OF THE BOOKS. AND IT'S NICE TO SEE A STATTE THAT IS ALL JUST LINED OUT. ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY. EIGHT OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING KAREN COMMITTEE GOING BACK US FOR THE ELEVATOR CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND FOR DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESS IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF COURSE ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. OUT WE ARE IN. WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AS WE HAVE BEEN SINCE -- THE FIRST HOUSE IN THE FIRST COMMITTEE WHEN IT WAS BROUGHT -- I I I I WOULD NOTE THAT -- WE'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH CONCERNS WITH THE STATUTE OTHER THAN IT WAS CREATED MANY YEARS AGO AND IT INCLUDES A FINE FOR PEOPLE WHO DISOBEY IT -- THERE ARE SITUATIONS IN WHICH A PEACE OFFICER MIGHT LOOKED PRIVATE PERSONS FOR ASSISTANCE IN MATTERS OF EMERGENCY. ARREST A PUBLIC SAFETY AND WERE UNCONVINCED THE STATUTE SHOULD BE REPEALED. AT AND I JUST. RESPECTFULLY I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS PROPOSAL WAS BROUGHT TO US POTENTIAL AN INFORMAL STATE IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN BY THE AUTHORS OFFICE. AND I INDICATED OVER EMAIL TO THIS TO THE STAFF FOR THAT -- WE WOULD LIKELY HAVE CONCERNED WITH IT -- AND SO I JUST I WANT TO SORT OF CORRECT THAT NOTION THAT -- WE HAVE ENGAGED OR WE HAVE AN EXPRESS CONCERNS I THINK WE'VE BEEN FAIRLY CLEAR ABOUT THAT AND CERTAINLY HAVE A LETTER -- IN THE RECORD ONCE THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED SO JUST. JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT FOR CLARITY -- AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- MISTER LACKEY. YEAH FIRST OF ALL I MEAN. CERTAINLY IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT'S A HIGHLY YOU STATUTE. I'D LIKE TO KNOW LAST TIME SOMEBODY WAS ACTUALLY. CHARGED WITH THIS OFFENSE. I WOULD I WOULD CHALLENGE SOMEBODY ON YOUR STAFF TO COME FORWARD WITH THAT -- BECAUSE IF YOU CAN. PROVE TO ME THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM. THEN I'LL. RECONSIDER MY VOTE BUT RIGHT NOW. A LOT OF THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT ARE BEING. BENNETT ABOUT FORGET RURAL COMMUNITIES RURAL COMMUNITIES AT AND THE ALSO THE THE NATURE OF RURAL COMMUNITIES. AS MUCH DIFFERENT WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AVAILABLE. IN THESE KIND OF CIRCUMSTANCES GO TO THE ESPECIALLY. DESERT COMMUNITIES -- IN THE SOUTH. TO THE NORTH THERE ARE MANY MANY REMOTE AREAS WHERE -- ASSISTANCE WOULD BE. NEEDED AND I'D I'D I JUST FIND THIS TO BE. INTERESTING NORMALLY WHEN WE CREATE STATUTES WE HAVE TO SHOW A PROBLEM BEFORE WE ADDRESS IT AND I DON'T SEE THIS AS BEING A PROBLEM. SEVERAL TROUBLE WITH IT YES. BECOME LIKE A DOVE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I TO WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS BILL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE OFF AS MANY OLD IN BAD BILLS AS POSSIBLE FROM THE BOOKS AND I THINK RESPECTFUL DISOBEDIENCE. AND SELF DETERMINATION IS OKAY SO I LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING FOR THIS BILL AND I WOULD ALSO ASK THAT -- SENATOR IF HE WOULD CONSIDER ME AS A CO AUTHOR ON SB THIRTY SAY ABSOLUTELY. THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER GLAD YOU COMMENT. YOU MAY CLOSE AND IF YOU WANT TO DRESS I WILL NEED TO CONCERNED YEAH I I A COUPLE OF THINGS YOU KNOW. THERE IS A LEGITIMATE PUBLIC POLICY PURPOSE TO TAKE DEAD LETTER LAWS OFF THE BOOKS. THERE IS A PURPOSE THERE IS INSPIRING CONFIDENCE IN THE GOVERNMENT AND TO THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENT THAT SOMETIMES STUFF IS NO LONGER NECESSARY TO BE A LAW. THAT THE SYSTEM ONLY PRODUCES MORE AND MORE AND MORE LAWS AND THICKER BOOKS IN THAT PART OF OUR OBLIGATION IS TO CONTINUE TO LOOK BACK. TO RECONSIDER AND TO THINK THAT STUFF THROUGH IN EXACTLY THE POINT THAT IT HASN'T BEEN USED TO ME INFORMS EXACTLY THE REASON WHY IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE ON THE BOOKS. BECAUSE IT HASN'T BEEN USED SO YOU DO SERVE A PURPOSE THE THE THE INDEED THE SHERIFFS HAVE BEEN OPPOSING BUT WE ASK THEM IN MARCH OF ANY INSTANCE WHAT IS BEEN USED AND WE'VE GOTTEN NO RESPONSE THE LAST THING WE COULD FIND WAS IN. NINETEEN THIRTY FIVE AND THE QUESTION FROM A PUBLIC POLICY PERSPECTIVE IS WE HAVE ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX LAWS ON THE BOOKS THAT ALREADY. REQUIRE A PEOPLE TO BE INVOLVED BUT THIS DOESN'T JUST SAY A FINE THIS MAKES IT A MISDEMEANOR YOU PUT SOMEBODY IN JAIL FOR FAILING TO DO SO. THAT TO ME IS DIFFERENT AND THE LAST ISSUE A RURAL COMMUNITIES THE EVIDENCE AS WE BEGAN TO LOOK AT IT IS THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO PUT SOMEBODY IN JAIL AND TO FORCE THEM TO CONSCRIPT THEM. TO HELP YOU BECAUSE GENERALLY IN SMALLER RURAL COMMUNITIES PEOPLE KNOW EACH OTHER AND IT'S A VOLUNTARY ENVIRONMENT WHERE EVERYBODY'S TRYING TO HELP. THE COMMON GOOD ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OF AS YOU KNOW MISTER IS BURKE AYE I WORKED ON SOME BACALL DEVELOPMENT REFORM. WHERE I LOOK AT ALL THE PLANNING RULES AND REGULATIONS A LOS ANGELES HAMMER AND I CUT THAT IN HALF I REMEMBER HAVING KIND OF THE SAME ARGUMENT? WHY DO WE STILL HAVE THESE PLANNING CODES IN HERE WHEN I HAD BEEN USED? NOT AS LONG AS THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS BUT THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS UP. AND WE START TO ELIMINATE THINGS -- GET A PROBLEM WE HAD WE HAD. RULES ON THE BOOKS THAT WERE CREATED BY BUREAUCRATS WITHIN THE SYSTEM WHO FOUGHT TO KEEP IT EVEN THOUGH THEY NO LONGER HAD A PURPOSE. OR WE COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING MUCH EASIER. AND LESS COMPLICATED -- ULTIMA REDUCED THE PLANNING BOOK FROM MAYBE THAT HIGH TO ABOUT HALF THAT HIGH OFF THE FLOOR -- BUT IT IT WAS A STRUGGLE SO I UNDERSTAND AND AND IT'S AND IT'S GOOD TO START TAKING SOME OF THESE OUTDATED RULES OFF THE OFF OF OUR LEGISLATIVE. CALENDAR SO OUR CHAIRS RECOMMEND AYE VOTE THANK CIRCLE ROOM. SB ONE NINETY TO THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NOT VOTING POWER QUE HAN. POWER QUE HAN I DEEP. DEEP I KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE I QUIRK. QUIRK I SANTIAGO SANTIAGO AYE WICKS. WICKS I THE BILL PASSES. NOW WE HAVE SENATOR BELL -- ITEM NUMBER. THIRTEEN SB TO A FOR JUVENILE JUSTICE COUNTY SUPPORT OF WARDS EVERY READY CENTER. THE MORNING EVERYBODY -- MISTER TERM MEMBERS -- THIS BILL -- IS -- SB -- TWO EIGHTY FOUR KEEP YOU FELT [inaudible] KEEP YOU. CLOSE TO HOME AT NOW OF THIS WAS A BILL I'VE BEEN TRYING. TO CONCEPTUALIZE FOR A LONG TIME. BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A TREND THAT WE ALL. HAVE SEEN. AND THE TREND IS THAT -- THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE -- FACILITY POPULATION HAS GONE DOWN. CONSISTENTLY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THE JUVENILE FACILITIES POPULATION. AT THE COUNTIES HAS GONE DOWN. OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS SO WE HAVE A SITUATION. WHERE WERE NOW CONSIDERING A NEW DEPARTMENT? AND SO THAT'S THE CONTEXT WHICH I'M INTRODUCING THIS BILL MISTER CHAIRMAN. NOW IN LOOKING AT THE POPULATION OF THE DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE. GOOD NOW AVERAGES OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH PER PERSON. PER YEAR WITH. OF THAT AMOUNT THE COUNTY'S CONTRIBUTE 8%. OR TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YOU. WITH THE STATE PAYING THE REST THE TAX BASE ROUTE CHAIRS SUBSIDIZING -- THE COST OF SO. WHAT'S HAPPENED AS AS THE POPULATION. HAS DROPPED. THE COST PER PERSON HAS GONE UP. AND IT'S NOW BECOME A VERY ON EQUAL -- PROPOSITION ON WHO'S PAYING. FOR THE COST OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. SO THIS BILL INCREASES THE COUNTY TO BE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR MANY OF JUST MANY OF NOT ALL BUT TO SPUR LOCAL REHABILITATION. COMMUNITY BASED SUPPORT AND KEEP THEM CLOSE TO HOME [inaudible] AND LIKE IN THE LAST DECADE IT WAS. JUST TO GIVE YOU THESE ASTOUNDING NUMBERS TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE IN OUR FACILITIES AND STATE FACILITIES. NOW WE'RE ABOUT. SEVEN HUNDRED SO IT'S REALLY CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. HOWEVER THIS DID HOWEVER THE DECLINE IS DUE TO A STEADY REDUCTION AND YOU CRIME. CHANGES THE LEGISLATURE HAS MADE TO PROMOTE ALTERNATIVES TO INCARCERATION -- WE NEED TO CONTINUE MAKING THESE CHANGES FOR YOU. INVEST IN THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OUR LOCAL ALTERNATIVES. CONFINEMENT ON TO YOU. IN A YOUTH PRISON. IS DETRIMENTAL TO ONE'S MENTAL HELP AND FOR YOU. ESPECIALLY -- SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED TRAUMA. RELOCATION CREATES CHANGE NOT INCARCERATIONS STUDIES SHOW YOUTH ARE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE AS THEY MOVE FROM ADOLESCENCE TO ADULTHOOD. AND HOW WE CARE FOR THEM DURING THIS YEAR'S WILL SHAPE THE FUTURE NOW THE GOVERNOR AGREES THAT THE CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES. ARE NOT APPROPRIATE ENVIRONMENTS TO ADDRESSING THE USED NEEDS THAT'S WHY. HE PROPOSES SHIPPED. OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT -- FROM FOR SHIFTING -- DEPARTMENT JUVENILE JUSTICE OUT OF THE CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT TO HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IN THE BUDGET SO THAT'S PART OF OUR BUDGET -- THEY WERE CONSIDERING THIS WEEK. IF WE LOOK AT THEIR CURRENT POPULATION -- YOU KNOW HOW TO HOW TO SIT. WHAT IS THE RESULTS WE GET? WELL 74% OF THE U.. THAT ARE IN OUR FACILITIES RECIDIVIST WITHIN THREE YEARS OTHER WORDS THEY GO BACK INTO CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES IN THREE YEARS. IN ORDER TO READ IT THAT THAT'S THAT'S LIKE A FAILURE RATE THAT'S PRETTY ASTOUNDINGLY HIGH. SO WE NEED TO CHANGE THESE NUMBERS AND ENSURE SUCCESS UPON RELEASE. AND THIS BILL CREATES THIS FISCAL INCENTIVES FOR COUNTIES TO CRITICALLY CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE OPTIONS RATHER THAN GOING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE FIRST. SUCH AS CONTRACTING WITH OTHER COUNTIES. ARE THOSE THAT DO NOT HAVE SECURE FACILITIES. THE BILL AIMS TO PROMOTE LOCAL REHABILITATION CREATE SUPPORT OF AND SAFE ENVIRONMENTS AND REDUCE RECIDIVISM. WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT THIS SOME MORE MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS ARE ALL TURN OVER THEM. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING I'M MORE IN WASHBURN WITH THE CENTER ON JUVENILE AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE. I IN SINCE NINETEEN SIXTY ONE CALIFORNIA HAS CHARGED COUNTIES A FEE FOR COMMITTING YOU TO DJJ -- AND WE'VE REVISED SB SEVERAL TIMES OVER THE YEARS. SB TWO EIGHTY FOUR WILL SIMPLY UPDATE THE FEE AMOUNT PLACING IT ON PAR WITH THE CURRENT COST OF LOCAL ALTERNATIVES. AND ENSURING THAT COUNTIES ARE PAYING CLOSER TO THEIR FAIR SHARE. OF THE THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER USE -- THAT WE'RE SPENDING AT DJJ. MY TEAM HAS DONE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH ON CURRENT CONDITIONS IN THE DJJ FACILITIES AND WE FOUND THAT THEY CONTINUE TO OPERATE AS THEY HAVE FOR DECADES. AS REMOTE PRISON LIKE INSTITUTIONS THAT EXPOSE YOUTH TO SERIOUS TRAUMA. AND WE KNOW THAT YOUTH FARE BETTER WHEN THEY'RE PLACED IN SMALLER SETTINGS THAT ARE CLOSE TO LOVED ONES. AND YET THE CURRENT FEE FOR COMMITTING A YOUTH TO DJJ JUST TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS MAKES IT FAR LESS EXPENSIVE FOR COUNTY TO SEND THE YOUNG PERSON TO THE STATE. AND TO KEEP THEM LOCALLY. THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN ENSURING THE JURISDICTIONS ARE DOING THEIR PART TO SUPPORT YOUTH CLOSER TO HOME. AND COUNTIES TODAY ARE VERY WELL POSITIONED TO SERVE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE IN LOCAL SETTINGS BECAUSE ON AVERAGE. LOCAL FACILITIES ARE OPERATING AT JUST 30% CAPACITY. 70% EMPTY WHICH MEANS THEY COULD ABSORB THE JJ'S POPULATION MORE THAN THIRTEEN TIMES OVER. THE STATE IS ALSO ALLOCATING% HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS EACH YEAR FOR LOCAL SERVICES AND ALTERNATIVES TO DJJ AND THAT'S AN AMOUNT THAT INCREASED DESPITE DECLINES IN THE NUMBER OF YOUTH INVOLVED IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. AN EIGHTEEN COUNTIES HAVE RECENTLY RECEIVED FUNDS TO CONSTRUCT OR RENOVATE NEW LOCAL FACILITIES FUNDS THEY RECEIVED FROM THE STATE. SO TO BRING OUR YOUTH BACK HOME AND ENSURE THAT INNOVATION CONTINUES LOCALLY WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB TWO EIGHTY FOUR THANK YOU. RIGHT AT THE PERSON [inaudible] HELLO [inaudible] GOOD MORNING -- MY NAME IS ELISA AMERICA'S AND I'M HERE TODAY TO SHARE WITH YOU MY VERY OWN TESTIMONY -- WITH DIVISION OF JUVENILE JUSTICE CURRENTLY -- WITH MOTIVATING INDIVIDUAL LEADERSHIP FOR PUBLIC ADVANCEMENT. WHEN I WAS SENT TO DJJ I WAS SIXTEEN YEARS OLD? ONE THE CUSTODY OF DJJ HAVE FACED VERY UNHEALTHY AND POOR CONDITIONING. PERSONALLY I HAVE A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH MY FAMILY. THEREFORE THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE ONES THAT I'VE TURN TO FOR GUIDANCE AND SUPPORT. HOWEVER BEING AT DJJ FALTERED ARE ONCE THIRTY RELATIONSHIP DUE TO BEING SEVERAL HOURS AWAY. EXPENSIVE TRAVEL AND DISCRIMINATION. THERE ARE MANY BARRIERS BETWEEN MY FAMILY AND I WHICH THEY CREATED A DISTANCE AND INTERFERENCE WITH OUR BOND IN A TIME OF CRITICAL NEED. I'M RECOVERING PARAPLEGIC AND I WENT TO DJJ NINE MONTHS AFTER TRAUMATIC INJURY. I SAY THAT NOT NOT FOR PITY BUT TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW THAT I NEED MY FAMILY SUPPORT TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE. THE JUSTICES AYE BASEBALL. BEING IN DJJ PERTAIN TO MY DISABILITY RIGHTS IMPROPER MEDICAL CARE AND REHABILITATION SERVICES THAT WERE NOT EFFECTIVE IN HELPING ME TO RE INTEGRATE SMOOTHLY BACK INTO SOCIETY. THE DJ FAILED TO MEET MY NEEDS BY NOT PROVIDING NECESSARY IN VITAL TREATMENT THAT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE BETTERMENT OF MY OVERALL WELL BEING. I WAS COMPLETELY ISOLATED FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD AND SUCH REMOTE LOCATION WHICH ONLY INTENSIFIED MY TIME AT DJJ WHERE VIOLENCE IS FREQUENT AND STAFF ABUSE THEIR AUTHORITY. AND SEEN THAT MY FAMILY WERE WILLING AND AND WANTED TO BE THERE AND ACTUALLY ATTEMPTED TO VISIT ME SAID. SEVERAL TIMES WERE NEVER ALLOWED IN ENTRY. ONLY ADDED TO THE ALREADY EXISTING BURDEN THAT I CARRIED. DJJ PREPARED NEEDS. TO GET OUT AND FALL FACE FIRST. WHEN I WHEN I WAS RELEASED I WAS VERY ANXIOUS AND DISCONCERTED? I DO NOT HAVE ANY CLUE AS AS HOW TO REBUILD MY LIFE OR MY RELATIONSHIPS. AND DUE TO ALL THE PAIN THAT I HAVE BEEN DELIVERED AND IN HOPES THAT YOU IN THE FUTURE WHEN I HAVE TO FACE.

WELL ANYWAY YOU WANT. I'M HELEN ROUGH THOUSAND FROM SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND REPRESENTING. THE TEACHERS AND HEALTH PERSONALITY JJ AND WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. IN REALITY THIS BILL WILL LEAD TO THE CLOSURE OF DJJ AND THE STATE WITH FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY GOVERNMENTS. AND ONLY SEVEN HUNDRED OF JUVENILES IN DJJ WE AT WHAT ASK WHO COULD REPLICATE CURRENT SPECIALIZED THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS CREATED UNDER FAIR ALL WITHIN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. FOR EXAMPLE THE SECULAR SEXUAL OFFENDERS PROGRAM HAS SIXTY TWO WORDS FROM ACROSS THE STATE. IT'S RUN BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI IN A COST MILLIONS BUT IT HAS GOOD TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESS THE PROGRAM RECOGNIZES THAT MANY OF THE WORDS WERE THEMSELVES SEXUALLY ABUSED. SOMETIMES BY PARENTS OR RELATIVES IN THEIR HOMES. MAYBE ONLY LA HAS HE NUMBER OF WORDS TO RUN THEIR OWN PROGRAM. THERE IS A CON A MI OF SCALE AND DJJ THAT ALLOWS A PROGRAM TO OUGHT THESE PROGRAMS OPERATE. ASK YOURSELF IF IT'S FEASIBLE THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES RUN THEIR OWN PROGRAMS FOR THIS POPULATION -- I ASK A JUVENILE SHORT ONE OF THE JUVENILE. COURT JUDGES ABOUT THIS IN A LARGE A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTY AND SHE SAID -- COUNTY WOULD NOT COMMIT THESE KIND OF RESOURCES. IN FACT THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF PROGRAMS ARE OPERATED BY COUNTIES OR THEIR THEIR OUTCOMES DESPITE PROVIDING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND REALIGNMENT DOLLARS. AND REALIGNMENT WAS PASSED WITH FEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS MAYBE THIS IS A GOOD PLACE TO START. FURTHER THE STATISTICS QUOTED I'M DJJ ARE WHERE FROM TWENTY THOUSAND ELEVEN BEFORE TH TWENTY ELEVEN BEFORE ON THE CHANGES FROM FAIR ALL WE SEE DJ JJ AS A TERTIARY FACILITY. RATHER THAN REPLICATING PROGRAMS AND FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WE SHOULD STRENGTHEN THE THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMS THAT CAN BE USED FOR RESOURCES FOR ALL COUNTY. SANTA CLARA ANOTHER LARGE COUNTIES MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THIS BUT WHAT ABOUT AMADOR IMPERIAL. SISKIYOU SAN LUIS OBISPO THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES CAN BE HIGH AND WE ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER THESE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THANK YOU THANK YOU MAX. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE G. PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA HERE IN OPPOSITION TODAY -- I I WANT TO START WITH THE FACT THAT WE PROBATION SHE'S VERY MUCH AGREE WITH THE NOTION OF KEEPING KIDS LOCALLY AND I THINK THAT'S EVIDENCED BY. THE LEADERSHIP OF PROBATION -- ART COUNTY COUNTERPARTS AND AND OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE TO DO THAT OVER SEVERAL SEVERAL -- AT MANY YEARS AND WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT COMMITMENT THROUGH A 74% REDUCTION -- OF YOU BEING SENT TO DJJ -- A 60% DECLINE IN JUVENILE DETENTION IT IN ITS ENTIRETY -- AND AND DJJ REALLY DOES REPRESENTS -- NOT THE FIRST CHOICE FOR FOR COUNTIES ARE LOCAL COURTS BUT REALLY FOR THOSE YOUTH THAT REPRESENT ON THE HIGHEST RISK OF RE OFFENDING THE HIGHEST NEEDS OR WHO ARE IN NEED OF SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS THAT. THAT COUNTIES DO NOT HAVE AN AND THOSE ARE REALLY THE PRINCIPLES IN WHICH WE OPERATE UNDER -- IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE SLIDING SCALE THAT THIS BILL KIND OF SEEKS. TO RE INSTITUTE WAS WAS REALLY PUT IN PLACE MANY YEARS AGO AT A TIME WHEN DJJ POPULATION WAS AT ITS HIGHEST AND SO THE FOCUS WAS ON HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE TO KEEP. A MORE YOUTH LOCALLY SB EIGHTY ONE JUVENILE REALIGNMENT REALLY SET IN MOTION PROBATION COMING TO THE TABLE AND SAYING WE WE WANT TO KEEP THESE KIDS LOCALLY WE THINK THIS MAKES SENSE. AND THOSE YOU NOW ARE KEPT LOCALLY MANY OF WHICH YOU ARE ACTUALLY IN OUR COMMUNITY BEING SERVED AND NOT EVEN AND OUR HALLS. AND SO REINSTITUTING THIS -- SLIDING SCALE AT A TIME NOW WHERE DJ POPULATION IS AT ITS LOWEST -- REALLY DOESN'T FIT TOGETHER ALL OF THE PIECES AND DYNAMICS THAT WE KNOW TO BE TRUE ABOUT HOW THE SYSTEM CURRENTLY LOOKS -- AND WE ARE VERY MUCH CONCERNED THAT JUST INCREASING THE FEE ABSENT ALL OF THESE OTHER DYNAMICS IS GOING. TO LOCAL PRESSURES ON THE FUNDING THAT WE CURRENTLY ARE USING TO INFUSE THE LOCAL SYSTEM WHICH IS TO KEEP KIDS OUT OF DJJ KEEP KIDS OUT OF R. HALLS AND KEEP THEM IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE WHERE POSSIBLE AND SO -- DIVERTING FUNDING TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL COST TO DJ IS GOING TO HAVE OTHER SYSTEM IMPACTS AND WE ARE VERY MUCH CONCERNED ABOUT. NOT WANTING TO MAKE THOSE SHIFTS AND AND HARM ANY PARTS OF OUR CUT KIND OF FROM IN PREVENTION EFFORTS. AND ULTIMATELY THE HEALTH WELFARE AND SAFETY OF OUR YOUTH AND COMMUNITY ARE THOSE GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF OF KIND OF HOW WE OPERATE IN WHO GOES TO DJJ AND AND SO WERE CERTAINLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACTS THAT THIS BILL WILL HAVE WE ASK FOR YOUR NEW VOTE TODAY. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS ELIZABETH ESPINOSA IT HERE BEHALF OF THE URBAN COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING FOURTEEN OF THE LARGEST COUNTIES AS WELL AS THE RURAL COUNTY -- REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING THIRTY SIX OF THE THE SMALLER IN RURAL COUNTIES ALSO IN OPPOSITION I WILL ALIGN MYSELF LARGELY WITH THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA -- AND WOULD JUST MAKE TWO ADDITIONAL POINTS FROM THE BROAD COUNTY PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD THE VIEW. THAT THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS INDEED THAT A SYSTEM WITH A CONTINUUM OF SERVICES SANCTIONS INTERVENTION PREVENTION -- A PROGRAMS WITH THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE YOUTH BEING SERVED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- WE DO VIEW -- AS MS SANCHEZ INDICATED -- AND APPRECIATE THE BENEFITS OF KEEPING KIDS LOCALLY IN IN ABSOLUTELY EVERY INSTANCE THAT WE CAN. BUT THERE IS -- AT AT THE AT THE DEEP END AT THE THE HIGH NEED AND OF THE CONTINUING WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE STATE HAS A ROLE IN PROVIDING SERVICES AND SPECIALIZED TREATMENT THAT COUNTIES. DO NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MANAGE LOCALLY IN EVERY INSTANCE -- SO WE THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE STATEMAINTAIN A PRESENCE REGARDLESS OF WHERE DJJ MAY EXIST IN IN THE STATE SYSTEM WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE STATE HAS A ROLE IN PROVIDING SERVICES TO THOSE A YOUTH WHO HAVE THE HIGHEST NEEDS -- AND SECONDARILY -- THERE ARE FISCAL IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BILL THAT IS NOT THE THE MAIN POINT THAT WE'RE MAKING TODAY -- BUT WE I THINK WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT INCREASING THE FEE WILL HAVE POLICY IMPACTS AS WELL WE WILL BE TAKING RESOURCES FROM COUNTIES THAT WERE CURRENTLY INVESTING IN KEEPING THE KIDS LOCALLY WE WILL HAVE TO TURN AROUND AND USE THOSE RESOURCES. TO PAY FOR THE HIGHER FEE AND FOR THOSE REASONS ON BEHALF OF YOU SEE SEE AN RC RC WE REGRET THAT WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES. JESSICA ELEVEN TEN THE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN OPPOSITION. RG RETIRED CHECK ON BEHALF OF SACRAMENTO COUNTY IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. HOW PARTISAN CENTER THAT WE MISSED THE ME TO THIS BUT THIS CAN GO FROM THE JUSTICE COALITION STRONG SUPPORT HONORED TO BE COSPONSORS? WE NOW THE RESOURCES AND THE KNOWLEDGE TO BUILD LOCAL ALTERNATIVES THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MILLER LOOKS UP IN WHAT YOU JUST AS COALITION IN STRONG SUPPORT. AND GROWTH POLICIES WE ALSO MESSED KAELIN DEAN ALLIANCE FOR BOYS AND MEN OF COLOR AT POLICY LINK IN STRONG SUPPORT. PLAN TO DO OVER THE DO JUSTICE COALITION PUCKLE SPONSORS OF THE BILL THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR QUIRK -- I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I'LL MOVE IT IN A MOMENT BUT FIRST I'D LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT TO THE OPPOSITION -- THIS BILL DID GET THIRTY VOTES IN THE SENATE. I DO NOT THINK THAT THE AUTHOR PLANS TO SHUT DOWN DJJ I THINK THE COMMENTS ABOUT CERTAIN KIDS BEING SERVED BASS. THEY'RE PROBABLY MAKES SENSE. BUT WHAT I ALSO SEE IS A GREAT DISPARITY. ALAMEDA COUNTY HAS THE CITY OF OAKLAND KNOWN FOR UNFORTUNATELY HAVING A LOT OF YOUTH VIOLENCE. YES. WELL IT'S 50% LARGER THAN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY -- WHICH HAS MUCH LESS OF AN URBAN -- USE OF VIOLENCE PROBLEM THEY SAID TWICE AS MANY PEOPLE TO D. J. J.. ARM YOU LOOK AT IT AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE YOU WILL SEE COUNTIES THAT STICK OUT. AS SENDING MANY MORE PEOPLE. NOW IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THIS SOLUTION I WOULD SUGGEST YOU SUGGEST ANOTHER OR IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE MONEY THAT IT COSTS. TO SMALLER COUNTIES THAT YOU SUGGEST -- SOME REDISTRIBUTION OF BUT I WOULD DEFINITELY LOOK FOR SOME SORT OF COMPROMISE ON THIS AGAIN I DO THINK D. J. J. MAKE SENSE. FOR MANY KIDS I'M JUST CONCERNED WHEN I SEE THIS DISPARITY. THAT NOT ALL THE KIDS WHO SHOULD BE SENT THERE ARE SENT THERE AND THAT I'M WORRIED THAT SOME OF THOSE SHOULD BE KEPT LOCALLY. OF FOR THAT REASON AGAIN I'M SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND I MOVED TO BELL. ANY OTHER CON JUST BARKING. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR COMMENTS DR THE COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE IS YOU MENTIONED THE RECIDIVISM RATE AT THE STATE FACILITIES YOU KNOW WHAT THE COMPARABLE RECIDIVISM RATE IS AT THE LOCAL FACILITIES. SAID THAT DATA ISN'T COLLECTED OKAY. HERE THAT A LOT FOR THE COUNTIES. I'M SO I GUESS I WOULD ASK WHAT YOUR COMMENT IS TO THE SPECIALIZED NEEDS. OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO BRING SAT I MEAN I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT. IN ALL PRISON POPULATION STAYING CLOSER TO HOME IS BETTER FOR THE PRISONERS AND FOR RECIDIVISM RATES -- BUT THAT BEING SAID I THINK AS WE'VE MOVED TO MORE OF A SYSTEM THAT HOLDS PEOPLE COUNTIES WE ALSO SEE. SOME PLACES LAST PROGRAMMING RIGHT AND THAT IN SOME CASES THERE ARE IT ISN'T LEADING NECESSARILY TO BETTER RESULTS IN HERE WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA TO WHETHER THAT'S TRUE OR NOT. AND SO I GUESS I WOULD ASK WHAT. IN THE BILL YOU USE AND SORT OF WHAT I WOULD THINK IS A ROUGH -- CORRELATOR WITH THE TYPE OF CRIME COMMITTED SEVEN YEARS. VERSES I'M MORE SPECIALIZED DETERMINANT OF WHETHER SOMEONE NEEDS ONE OF THE SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS AND SO I WOULD ASK HER WHAT YOUR RESPONSES AND WHY. THE DECISION WASN'T MADE. TO TO REALLY TAYLOR THIS BILL SO THAT THOSE WHO NEED THE SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE IS PROVIDING CAN CONTINUE TO BE SENT AND WE ARE KEEPING THE PEOPLE CLOSE TO HOME WHO NEED IT. WELL JUST YOU KNOW -- KIND OF GIVE YOU YOU ASKED WHAT MY REASONS WORK I THINK I THINK YES THEY ARE. THE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR THOSE WHICH HAVE LESS THE FEARS SERIOUS CRIMES. AND OR COMMITTED A CRIME UNDER. SIXTEEN AND THEN DOES IT HAVE THE MORE SERIOUS CRIMES WE RECOGNIZE. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE. THAT WE LEFT AT THE TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THOSE PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE TO COME TO THE FACILITY IF A COUNTY WANTED TO SEND THE LESSER. OFFENDING -- GROUP TO THE FACILITY THEY CAN WE'RE NOT RESTRICTING THEM IN ANY WAY -- THEY JUST HAVE TO PAY WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE. A FAIR WHICH IS LESS THAN HALF OF THE COST. LESS THAN HALF THE COST. AND SINCE I'M ON THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE SENATE -- I'M THE ONE THAT LOOKS AT THE BUDGET. AND I OBSERVED THAT WE GET OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM COUNTY SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. OKAY SO WEAK WE GIVE THEM GIVE BLOCK GRANTS TO THE JUSTICE BROWN -- WE GIVE THEM THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- FOR THEIR FACILITIES WHICH ARE YOU KNOW UNDER CONSTRUCTION AT THIS TIME. AND THEY STILL HAVE -- FACILITIES THAT ARE ONLY A THIRD FULL. SO WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS THERE SERVE THIS REALIGNMENT TAKING PLACE WERE MOVING OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH'S -- HUMAN SERVICES -- WERE FOCUSED ON MAY. LOOK AT OUR FACILITIES IN A DIFFERENT WAY AND MAYBE READJUSTING OUR FACILITIES OVER TIME -- YOU MIGHT SEE. MAYBE SMALLER FACILITIES OPERATED BY THE STATE YOU MIGHT SEE. CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTIES TO OPERATE. WHAT I CALL THE INTERMEDIATE LEVEL TYPE OF FACILITIES THAT OTHER COUNTIES COULD SEND? YOUNG PEOPLE -- TO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WILL HAPPEN -- I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT THE SYSTEM'S NOT GOING TO STAY THE SAME IT'S GOING TO CHANGE. OF WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO OPERATE THIS FACILITIES. ONLY WITH A THIRD OF THE PEOPLE AND AT THREE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IT'S MONEY THAT. WE HOPE WILL SPENT WE CAN SPEND IT ON THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN ANOTHER WAY THAT WILL REDUCE RECIDIVISM. SO I THINK THERE'S THIS REALIGNMENT TAKING PLACE. RIGHT NOW OF THIS BILL DOESN'T SOLVE ALL THOSE REALIGNMENT ISSUES. THIS COMMITTEE AND AND OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE AND OTHER PEOPLE SHOULD BE THE GOVERNOR SHOULD BE -- FOCUSED ON THIS SUBJECT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS SO BIG PITCHER. ISSUE BUT BUT FOR OUR BILL -- WE THINK THIS IS THE WAY. TO MAYBE SIGNIFY THAT WE NEED TO CHANGE WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW SAYS RIGHT NOW IS NOT WORKING. FOR ANYBODY. SO THE OFFENSE THAT THE OPPOSITION CITED WAS YOUTH SEX OFFENDERS WOULD THEY FALL AND I APOLOGIZE I DON'T KNOWWHAT THE SENTENCE ON THAT IS WOULD THEY FALL UNDER THE SEVEN YEARS ARE OVER THE SEVEN YEARS. DOING NOW ANYBODY. YEAH THAT'S THE SEVEN YEAR AGGREGATES -- SENTENCE SO IT WILL BE A CASE BY CASE BASIS -- BUT I MEAN I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ALSO TO POINT OUT THAT THE THE THERE IS A PROGRAM FOR YOU FOR SEX OFFENSES AT DJJ WE HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS. ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT PROGRAM AND THE AT TREATMENT OF USE THAT ARE COMING INTO THE FACILITIES WITH SEX OFFENSES AT DJJ. SO I GUESS I WOULD URGE AND WE HEAR THIS A LOT FROM THE WAY WE'VE MOVED IN THE PRISON SYSTEM IS WE DON'T HAVE GOOD DATA ON WHAT IS WORKING AND WHAT IS NOT AT THE STATE LEVEL AND AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. AND I THINK THAT. I URGE ALL OF US TO BE MAKING MORE INFORMED DECISIONS WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT IF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING IF THOSE PEOPLE ARE -- ACIDITY TING OR NOT AND THAT WE SHOULD BE MAKING DATA DRIVEN INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT IS BEST FOR OUR YOUTH AND HOW TO TREAT THEM. AND WE KNOW THE BEING CLOSE TO HOME IS BEST FOR YOU BUT WE ALSO KNOW THE GETTING THE TREATMENT THEY NEED IS BEST FOR YOU. AND SO HOW DO WE FIND OUT WHAT IS WORKING AND CONTINUE THAT AND NOT JUST MAKE DECISIONS BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE THEBEST IDEA SO I WOULD -- JUST TO HAVE TO GET SOME OF THAT INFORMATION AND TRY TO MAKE A DECISION AND IF THAT IS A YOUTH POPULATION THAT IS BEING BETTER SERVED IN THOSE PLACES THEN WE WE CATER THE BILL TO ENSURE THOSE PEOPLE GET THE TREATMENT THEY NEED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MARKET OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AS WELL I DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW THAT I THINK THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DISMANTLE D. J. J.. BUT IF THAT WERE THE CASE I WOULD BE OKAY WITH THAT -- TOO I THINK THAT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FACILITIES THAT ARE NOT FULL. WHAT YOU END UP WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS? YOU EITHER HAVE THE STATE TURNING INTO A PROPERTY MANAGER -- OPERATING FACILITIES OR YOU HAVE A STATE LOOKING TO FILL ITS VACANCY RATE. AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT INTERESTED IN HAVING THE PENDULUM SWING BACK SO THAT WE CAN FIND WAYS TO FILL THOSE SLOTS BECAUSE WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVE. THAT THIS IS A SYSTEM THAT WE NEED TO KEEP IN PLACE. WE MAY NOT HAVE THE ANSWERS TO EVERY QUESTION. AND ANSWERS THAT ARE PERFECT BUT THAT'S CALLED LIFE AND IT'S ALSO CALLED EVOLUTION AND I THINK WHAT THIS BILL IS SAYING IS THAT WE HAVE DONE THIS FOR A TIME. AND IT'S PROVEN NOT TO BE EFFECTIVE I ALSO THINK. THAT HAVING USED THESE ARE YOUTH PRISONS ESSENTIALLY. ISOLATED FROM THEIR COMMUNITY FROM THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. IS NOT HELPFUL MANY OF US ARE PARENTS AND WE'RE CERTAINLY NOT INTERESTED IN SENDING OUR KIDS VERY LONG DISTANCES FOR VERY LONG PERIODS OF TIME WITHOUT ANY HELP OR WITHOUT ANY -- VISITATION FROM US OUR COUNCIL. AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER. OF ROBUST. EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE WHO CAN PROBABLY HANDLE THE SPECIALIZED NEEDS THAT A NUMBER OF THESE YOUTH MEET. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GO BACK TO THE COMMUNITIES. WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FROM AND SAY HOW DO WE INTEGRATE OF THOSE SERVICES AND THOSE MENTORS INTO THE LIVES OF THESE YOUNG FOLKS WHILE WE'RE HOPING THAT THEY REHABILITATE? RATHER THAN AND FIND WAYS TO SHIFT THEM CONTINUALLY INTO A STATE SYSTEM. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENT TO THE QUESTION. YOU MAY CLOSE SENATE BILL SHARMAN WE HAVE WE HAVE FOUR FACILITIES -- THE USED TO HANG OUT HANDLE UP TO TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. OF NOW THERE ARE. SEVEN HUNDRED AND WE'RE RUNNING THE FOR FACILITIES AS YOU SAID AS A PROPERTY MANAGEMENT. AND AND THE SYSTEM'S GOING TO CHANGE WHEN IT GOES OVER TO THE OTHER DEPARTMENT. SO -- I THINK I THINK -- WE ALL KNOW. IN CRIMINAL JUST STARTING CRIMINAL JUSTICE. THAT BRINGING KIDS CLOSER TO THEIR HOME TO THOSE RESOURCES. THERE NEAR WHERE THEY LIVE HERE FAMILIES. IS IS THE PROPER WAY. TO HANDLE KIDS THAT HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES AND IF WE EVER HOPE TO REHABILITATE THEM. AND PREVENT THE RICH RECIDIVISM WE HAVE TO DO THAT. AND THAT'S WHY I INTRODUCED THIS BILL AND I REGION I VOTE. THANK YOU AND I'M. GOING TO SUPPORT IS I THINK PART OF PROBLEM IS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT NEW IT IS -- I'M GOING TO NORWAY. TO LOOK AT HOW THEY IMPRISON. PEOPLE THERE. THEY'RE NOT GRAY THEY'RE NOT CEMENT THE NOT BARS -- LOT OF LOOK LIKE DORMS AND THEY HAVE A HUGE -- RATE WHERE PEOPLE DO NOT RECEIVE A THEY TREAT THEIR THEIR INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS MUCH DIFFERENT. I THINK THE WAY WE START IS TO START WITH OUR YOUNG PEOPLE. THE THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO HANDLE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM NOT ALREADY CHANGED THE FACILITIES THE WAY THEY LOOK. BUT I WANT THIS I'VE NEVER BEEN A BIG FAN AND I PROBABLY GET SOME GROUNDS OF OF EVIDENCE BASED I'VE BEEN A FAN OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT. WHICH MEANS YOU PROVE THAT YOU'RE PROGRAMS WORK AND YOU PROVE THAT YOU GET MONEY BACK. TO THE STATE AND MAKE IT PROFITABLE. YOU MAKE IT SO THAT IT MAKES SENSE TO MAKE IT SO THAT PEOPLE GET BACK HOME. TO THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR SCHOOLS AND THEY DON'T STAY WITHIN THAT PRISON INDUSTRIAL SYSTEM. AND JUST STAY IN IT FOREVER AND THAT'S WHAT I CALL RETURN ON INVESTMENT. EVIDENCE BASE IS I CAN PROVE IT. BUT I DON'T WANT TO AUDIT. RETURN ON INVESTMENT YOU HAVE TO AUDIT AND WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK YOU NEED TO GET RID OF IT. WHEN IT DOES WORK YOU NEED TO GET MORE MONEY TO IT AND USUALLY EXPANDED AND YOU MAKE MAKE SURE IT IS ROBUST AND SO I THINK THAT'S PART A PROBLEM WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO? RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T FULLY SCOPED OUT ON THE ULTIMATE -- GOAL FOR TODAY JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM HOPEFULLY WE CALL IT. NOT AT RISK BUT AT BEEN A PROMISE SYSTEM BECAUSE THERE'S A PROMISE OF THE USE OF AMERICA THAT WE'RE REALLY FIGHTING. FOR WITH THAT [inaudible] CALDERON. ON SB TWO EIGHTY FOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY NO BAR QUE HAN BAR KAY AND I DEEP. DEEP NO KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE I QUIRK. QUIRK I SANTIAGO. WICKS WICKS I THE BILL PASSES THANK YOU. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE. MISTER HILL AND EMMA TAKE PERSONAL PRIVILEGE AND I'M A PRESENT MY BILL AFTER THAT EIJI OURS. NINETY ONE SECOND CHANCES MONTH RIGHT AFTER CENTER HILL PRESENTS HIS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- IN MEMBERS SB TWO TWENTY WILL STRENGTHEN SECURITY REQUIREMENTS AT FIRE ARMS RETAILERS TO HELP PREVENT FIRING THEFT. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THIS COMMITTEE APPROVED SP FOUR SIXTY FOR A BROADER VERSION OF THIS POLICY. THESE BILLS WERE THE WINNER OF MY THERE OUGHT TO BE A LAW CONTEST SUBMITTED BY A CONSTITUENT. AFTER BURGLARS USED A CAR TO RAM INTO A GUN STORE IN MY DISTRICT. THE ROBBERS BROKE INTO BROKE IN ON A SUNDAY MORNING INSTALLED AN UNDISCLOSED NUMBER OF GUNS LEFT IN THEIR CLASS IN THEIR GLASS DISPLAY CASES. THIS WAS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT IN. IN THESE TYPES OF BURGLARIES ARE ON THE RISE THE A TF TOLD MY OFFICE THAT AT LEAST ELEVEN OTHER SIMILAR SMASH AND GRAB ROBBERIES TOOK PLACE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN INCLUDING. ANOTHER IN MY DISTRICT SIMILAR SMASH AND GRAB FIREARM DEATHS HAVE OCCURRED MORE RECENTLY IN LOOMIS FAIRFIELD STOCKTON AND DIXON. BETWEEN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN GUN STORE BURGLARIES INCREASED BY 71% IN CALIFORNIA IN OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED GUNS WERE STOLEN. IT'S WELL ESTABLISHED THAT STOLEN GUNS ARE OFTEN USED TO COMMIT CRIMES SEVERAL ROBBERIES HAVE INVOLVED THE USE OF A CAR AS A BATTERING RAM IN MANY INSTANCES THE GUNS WERE LEFT UNSECURED OVERNIGHT. IN THEIR DISPLAY CASES. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM AS BE TO TWENTY UPDATES THE CURRENT SECURITY STANDARDS FOR GUN STORAGE. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN I HOSTED A SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH GUNS STORE OWNERS. TO SEE IF WE CAN MAKE THE BILL MORE FLEXIBLE. AS A RESULT WE EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF SECURITY OPTIONS FROM. TWO TO SIX PROVIDING IMPROVE COMPLIANCE OPPORTUNITY SPECIFICALLY EACH GUN STORE MUST COMPLY WITH ONE OF THE FOLLOWING SIX SECURITY OPTIONS. WITHIN WHEN STORING THEIR GUNS WHILE THE STORE IS CLOSED. LOCK THE GUNS IN THE SAFE LOCK THEM WITH A STEEL CABLE AND INSTALL BOLLARD IN FRONT OF THE STORE OR LOCKED THE GUNS BEHIND STEEL ROLL DOWN DOORS OR GATES OR LOCK THE GUN GENERAL GUN RACK. WITH A LOCKING STEEL BAR LOCKED THE GUNS IN A WINDOWLESS SECURE ROOM OR INSTALL STEEL ROLL DOWN DOORS ON ALL DOORS AND FLOOR TO CEILING WINDOWS OR FINALLY. LOCKED THE GUNS IN A GUN CABINET MADE WITH STEEL AND POLYCARBONATE SHEETS WE ALSO DELAYED IMPLEMENTATION BY SIX MONTHS TO GIVE TIME FOR STORES TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE. IT'S APPARENT FROM MY MEETINGS AT MANY GUN STORES ARE ALREADY IN COMPLIANCE WITH AT LEAST ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS AND AS A RESULT. I THINK THIS BILL WILL IMPACT A SMALL NUMBER OF STORES. WELL I BELIEVE WELL I BELIEVE WE BROUGHT GREATER FLEXIBILITY TO THE BILL THERE ARE WERE A FEW ISSUES WE COULDN'T RESOLVE. FOR EXAMPLE IT WAS REQUESTED THAT I ELIMINATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EXISTING AUTHORITY. TO ADOPT THEIR OWN REGULATIONS. HOWEVER THIS LOCAL AUTHORITY HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY THREE IT WAS NEVER THE INTENT OF THIS BILL TO UNDERMINE THAT LOCAL CONTROL OF THE S. B. TWO TWENTY PUTS FORWARD A REASONABLE AND FLEXIBLE SOLUTION TO A REAL PROBLEM ADDITION WHEN ANY OUTSTANDING ISSUES THAT REMAIN I I HAVE -- A WITNESS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS YEAH THE MORNING AMANDA WILCOX ON BEHALF OF BRADY CALIFORNIA UNITED AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE. AT OUR NEW NAME DOWN -- WE ARE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE POINT THAT EVERY FIREARM STARTS OUT AS A LEGAL GUN. AND AT SOME POINT OUR STARTS HAS A LEGAL GUN AND MANY HOW UP WHAT ARE BECOME ILLEGAL GUNS -- OBVIOUSLY FIND SOME WAY TO GO INTO THE INTO THE BLACK MARKER BECOME LEGAL IN THE CHAIN OF CUSTODY FROM. MANUFACTURER DISTRIBUTOR DEALER TO TRAFFICKER OR A THIEF -- AND AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE DATA -- CLEARLY ONE OF THE WAYS THAT GUNS GET INTO THE BLACK MARKET AND MAY ALTMAN BEING USED IN pFIREARM DEALERS AND OP WHEN ONE CONSIDERS THE NUMBER OF GUNS THAT ARE STORED IN THE FIREARMS DEALER. THE POTENTIAL FOR MANY FIRES THE STOLEN AT ONE TIME -- IS VERY ALARMING AND CERTAINLY A THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY AS YOU'VE HEARD THAT THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN THESE INCIDENTS. I IN RECENT YEARS MY MY STATISTIC WITH SEVENTY TWO POINT ONE NONE THE LESS THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN IT'S OF GRAVE CONCERN. IN MY OWN COMMUNITY IN NEVADA COUNTY IN GRASS VALLEY THERE WAS A SO CALLED CRASH AND GRAB INTO A GUN STORE THAT'S RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF A BIG NEIGHBORHOOD. AND BELIEVE ME THIS WAS VERY TRAUMATIC FOR ALL THE RESIDENCES RESIDENTS ARE IN THAT AREA OF GRASS VALLEY -- THIS BILL HAS BEEN BEFORE YOU BEFORE YOU HAVE PASSED IT I KNOW THAT THE SENATOR LAST TIME AROUND AUG SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME WORKING WITH -- DEALERS. TO FIND SOLUTIONS THAT WERE WORKABLE -- THE STORAGE SOLUTIONS THE CHOICES THAT ARE REQUIRED IN THIS BILL WOULD BE ONE TIME EXPENSES FOR DEALERS I'D LIKE TO MAKE THAT POINT -- AND WE FIND THIS -- CONSIDER THIS IMPORTANT WAY TO PREVENT GUNS FROM GETTING INTO THE LEGAL MARKET AND PERHAPS BEING USING CRIME AND CAUSING FIREARM INJURY AND DEATH THEREFORE WE URGE YOU TO ONCE AGAIN PASS THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT [inaudible] ANY WITH. I HAVE A QUICK BAY AREA STERN ACTIVISTS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- CAPPING LET'S REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION REPRESENTING OVER THIRTEEN HUNDRED MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA -- FIREARMS MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS SO I FIRST WANT TO SAY I WANT TO THANK SENATOR HALL I HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR HIM AND HE DID WORK WITH US IN GOOD FAITH ON THIS BILL. IN THE PAST HOWEVER WE DO CONTINUE TO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS WITH THE BILL -- THIS DOES PROVIDE MORE THAN ONE WAY TO COMPLY. BUT AGAIN THE SECURITY MEASURES THAT ARE OFFERED OF FOR RETAILERS THAT HAVE SOPHISTICATED AN INTRINSIC PLANS ALREADY IN PLACE THIS IS CUMBERSOME AND AND NOT WORKABLE. FOR EXAMPLE BASS PRO SHOP DOES OPPOSE THIS BILL AND THEY'VE MENTIONED FOR EXAMPLE THAT THEIR THEIR STORE IS ON FROM FLOOR LEVEL AND LIKE BALLARD'S DON'T WORK SO MANY OF THE OPTIONS OFFERED DON'T WORK FOR THEM. BUT THEY HAVE OTHER SECURITY MEASURES IN PLACE. THEY'RE ALSO LOCAL ON JURISDICTIONS THAT LIMIT VARIOUS CHANGES. THAT ARE BEING RECOMMENDED AS THE OPTIONS IN THE BILL DUE TO LOCAL ORDINANCES SUCH AS BALLARD'S DEPENDING ON WHERE THE STORE IS LOCATED. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A DAHLE REQUIREMENT I UNDERSTAND WHAT -- CENTERVILLE SAYING ABOUT THE LOCAL CONTROL ISSUE HOWEVER IF YOU HAVE THE STATE. OF LAW THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PUT INTO EFFECT HERE IN CONFLICT WITH THE LOCAL REGULATION -- THE RETAILER NEEDS A CLEAR PATHWAY TO KNOW HOW TO COMPLY BECAUSE THEY TECHNICALLY BE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH ONE OF THE OTHERS -- WITH THE BILL ONLY PROVIDES A LICENSEE AN EXCEPTION IN THE AUTHORITY GRANTED IF -- THEY SEEK ONE IT ISN'T A SHALL IT'S A MAY AND THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN THAT EXEMPTION IF THEY HAVE NO WAY TO COMPLY -- THIS GREATLY INCREASES THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN THE STATE WITHOUT ANY MAJOR BENEFITS TO PUBLIC SAFETY. THESE ARE VALUABLE PRODUCTS TO THE BUSINESS AND THEY WOULD INCUR INSURANCE A PRODUCT LOSSES IF THEY HAVE STEPS. THEY HAVE A STAKE IN PROTECTING THEIR PROPERTY AND THEY COULD LOSE THEIR LICENSE -- UNDER THESE CONDITIONS WHILE DATA WAS DISCUSSED FROM TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN A AS A DRIVER FOR THE BILL THE MOST CURRENT FBI SEMI ANNUAL. CRIME REPORT SHOWS A DECREASE OF FOUR POINT 3% VIOLENT CRIME RATES WHICH WOULD INCLUDE THE SMASHING GRABS. LASTLY THE INDUSTRY HAS AN AGGRESSIVE PROGRAM FOR RETAILERS AND US ABOUT HAS A VIDEO. THEY DO -- THEY HAVE SECURITY TEAMS ARE AVAILABLE TO RETAILERS TO GO IN AND DO COMPLIANCE AUDITS AND HELP THEM WITH SECURITY MEASURES. THEY WORK WITH THE FEDERAL AGENCIES -- ON THESE PROGRAMS SO THERE ARE A LOT OF ACTIVITIES ALREADY UNDER WAY. WE THINK WELL SB TWO TWENTY AS WELL INTENTIONED IT WILL CAUSE UNDUE CONFUSION CHAOS AND COST TO BUSINESSES WITHOUT ANY INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER SAMPRAS REPRESENTING GUN OWNERS CALIFORNIA ALSO IN THIS CASE THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION AND THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL ASSOCIATION AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS I WANT TO BRING THIS THIS PROBLEM. INTO REAL PERSPECTIVE WITH THE WITH THE REAL NUMBERS AT A REPORT. BY THE OF YOUR WALK ALL TOBACCO AND FIREARMS REGARDING SPECIFICALLY THIS ISSUE. OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. IN CALIFORNIA THERE HAVE BEEN OVER A MILLION GUNS SOLD. TO THE PUBLIC THROUGH GUN DEALERS. NOW THOSE OF THOSE SOLD THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE MILLIONS THAT ARE STILL IN INVENTORY. AND OUT OF THAT THREE YEARS AGO. DO THE BURGLARIES WHERE THEY BROKE INTO GUN STORES OR STOLE GUNS FROM GUN STORES THE TOTAL NUMBER OF GUNS STOLEN REPORTED BY THE BUREAU OF ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND FIREARMS. IS FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE GUNS. NOW THAT WAS STOLEN AND IDENTIFIED BY A GROUP OF ORGANIZED CRIME OF FOLKS WHO WERE DOING THE SMASHING GRABS PARTICULARLY THROUGHOUT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THEY WERE CAUGHT. THEY WERE ARRESTED THEY WERE. APPROPRIATELY. DEALT WITH. THE FOLLOWING YEAR THERE WERE A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR BURGLARIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OUT OF SIX THOUSAND DEALERS. OVER A MILLION GUNS THE NUMBER IS. ONE SEVENTY FOUR THIS PAST YEAR THE NUMBERS ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR TOTAL GUNS THAT HAVE BEEN STOLEN OUT OF AGAIN. OVER A MILLION GUNS SOLD AND MULTIPLE MILLIONS IN INVENTORY. THAT SHOULD TELL US THAT THE DEALERS ARE DOING. AN INORDINATELY GOOD JOB OF PROTECTING THEIR THEIR INVENTORY. BY WHATEVER MEANS THEY HAVE CHOSEN. THEY'RE DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB WE'RE TALKING A NUMBER THAT IS POINT ZERO ZERO ZERO ZERO AND A NUMBER. OF THE GUNS ARE STILL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM GUN DEALERS OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS. BECAUSE THE DEALERS ARE DOINGA GREAT JOB THE SENATOR DID A GREAT JOB I THINK IN IN ELEVATING THE ISSUE. LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THE PEOPLE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION THE AND AND AND THAT WAS THAT WAS OF A GOOD THING BUT THIS DOES NOT NEED A GOVERNMENT SOLUTION. BECAUSE YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET TO PERFECTION AND THE DEALERS ARE. AS CLOSE TO PERFECTION AS YOU CAN POSSIBLY GET. JUST BY WHAT THEY ARE DOING RIGHT NOW. AND IN THIS CASE. WORKING WITH THE OJWORKING WITH THE A TF I THINK THEY WILL THEY WILL CONTINUE DO A VERY GOOD JOB FOR THESE REASONS IN THE REASONS STATED BY MY MY COLLEAGUES AT THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION. SEE EUROPEAN GUN OWNERS CALIFORNIA ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND WE'RE OPEN FOR QUESTIONS AND REFERENCES IF ANYBODY WOULD LIKE THE SHEETS FROM THEA TF. OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR QUIRK BAR QUE HAN COMMA DOVE. THE STE [inaudible] AND WICKS. YOU FIRST MR QUIRK PURE -- FIRST OF ALL YOUR NUMBERS -- FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN I HAVE A LETTER HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL FROM GIFFORD'S LAWCENTER. THE CHOSEN. TWENTY SIXTEEN WITH SPECIFIC INCIDENTS THAT OVER TWO HUNDRED GUNS WERE STOLEN WITCHES. BELIEVE LARGER THAN THE NUMBER YOU'VE GIVEN US AND AGAIN THIS IS JUST SPECIFIC INCIDENTS I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE ALL OR PART -- SO MISS CENTER HILL -- DO YOU HAVE NUMBERS FOR ANY OF THOSE YEARS I DO NOT I MEAN I'D THE NUMBERS I HAVE WE'LL GO BACK TO TWENTY SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN BUT I I FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN TO SEVENTEEN WE AT THIRTEEN HUNDRED GUNS WERE STOLEN IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME BUT TO ME I I DON'T. KNOW THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NUMBER OF THE GUNS IT'S PROBABLY MORE IMPORTANT IS. THEY ARE STILL AND WHETHER IT'S ONE OR HUNDRED OR TWENTY FIVE OR WHATEVER THE COST THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF ADDING. THE SECURITY IS TO THE EXTENT THAT IT WAS RAISED AT THE EXCESSIVE COST IN ONE CASE AND ONE OPTION THEY COULD JUST INSTALL SECURITY FILM OVER THERE. GLASS DISPLAY CASES TODAY. I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBERS DO YOU HAVE. SO AT I DO WE DO IT THE NUMBERS IF OKAY CAN YOU GIVE ME THOSE NUMBERS. I GREW YEAH. I KNOW HE TALKED ABOUT THE NUMBERS -- YOU KNOW ONE GUN KILLED MY DAUGHTER I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M SORRY ANYONE IS TOO MUCH JUST THAT SO -- FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN I HAVE UP THERE ARE NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE FIREARMS REPORTED STOLEN BY AFL'S -- OF THE SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT WERE STOLEN TERM TERM BURGLARIES. WHEREBY THERE WAS AN OFF UNLAWFUL ENTRY TO COMMIT A THEFT. AT GUN STORES OR YEAH AT AFFECT THE HOUSE ALL RIGHT SO THE NUMBERS THAT WE WERE GIVEN. OUR ARE IN DISPUTE I TEND TO BELIEVE -- THE BRADY CAMPAIGNS NUMBERS BECAUSE I'VE HEARD OTHER BAD NUMBERS FROM YOU BEFORE I'M SORRY -- SECOND -- SO ONE OF THE OPTIONS IS TO PUT IN A SAFE. IF YOU PUT IN A SAFE IN YOUR GROUND FLOOR. I DO AND UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS. THAT -- THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT SOMEBODY JUST. YOU KNOW BARRELING INTO THE STORE ANYWAY BUT AS I READ THE BILL YOU WOULD REQUIRE BOLLARDS PERHAPS A ROLL DOWN STEEL DOOR. AND I AM HEARING THE CONCERN ABOUT THAT PERHAPS NOT PARTICULARLY THE ROLL DOWN STEEL DOOR I CAN IMAGINE A LOCALITY JUST NOT WANTING THAT HAPPENED. A COULD YOU ARE. SAY SOME MORE ABOUT THAT -- BE HAPPY TO THE YOUS ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK OF THERE ARE. EIGHT OPTIONS THAT SOMEONE CAN CHOOSE FROM TO SECURE THEIR WEAPONS IN THOSE STORES ONE OF THEM IS TO BLOCK THE WEAPONS IN THE STATE -- OKAY THE OTHER IS LOCKING IN THE SAFE LOCK THE MINUTE YOU HAVE THERE IN A SAFE YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING ELSE OKAY FINE. AGAIN THIS WAS NOT WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION. AND I TEND TO TRUST THE AUTHORITIES BILLS I'M GONNA MOVE THE BELL. THE CAT IS A FEW [inaudible] I'M. SO I WOULD JUST. YOU KNOW I'M A PRINCE WILL CALL OFF THEIR THIS BILL SO OBVIOUSLY I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT BUT I JUST WANTED TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE. BY SENATOR HILL THAT ONE GUN IS TOO MANY HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS IT TAKES ONE TO TAKE A LIFE AND SO. YOU KNOW. AS I READ THE BILL THERE ARE A LOT OF OPTIONS AS TO HOW TO SECURE IT BUT IF YOU HAVE A CLUE THEIR OPTIONS THAT ARE WORKING BECAUSE AGAIN THERE. ABOUT A MILLION GUNS YOU SAID SOLD A YEAR THREE MILLION OVER THREE MILLION -- A YEAR AND A LOT MORE THE MAJORITY DOES NOT BEING SOLD SO THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS THAT ARE WORKING I'M SURE SENATOR HILL WILL BE OPEN TO OTHER OPTIONS THAT ARE EFFECTIVE. BUT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR GUNS EVEN IF WE ASSUME THE LOW END IS TOO MANY. AND THAT WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO KEEP THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA SAFE AND THAT MEANS ENSURING THAT THESE FIREARMS AREN'T. STOLEN AND USED IN THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME SO HI. HELLO GOOD OF THANK YOU I'M SO I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES FOR NON COMPLIANCE. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ADDRESS. THEY LOSE THEIR PROBABLY FOR THE FEET. THREE EIGHT THE LICENSE IS SUBJECT TO FORFEITURE. I DON'T KNOW IF IT GOES TO THE LICENSE FORFEITURE OF THE NOT -- I DIDN'T WITH JOHN CAN WE RESPOND. IF THE IF YOU TYPICALLY BE VIOLATE ANY OF THE LAWS GOVERNING THE OPERATION OF THE BUSINESS IT'S THE LOSS OF YOUR LICENSE AND BUSINESS. SO CAN YOU SAY THAT AGAIN. TYPICALLY IF YOU'RE INVOLVED IN ANY VIOLATIONS OF THE LAWS GOVERNED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WITH THE OPERATION OF YOUR GUN DEALERSHIP. IT'S THE LOSS OF YOUR LICENSE AND YOUR ABILITY TO SELL FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION. OKAY I DIDN'T SEE THAT LANGUAGE IN HERE WHICH WAS WHY I WAS ASKING FOR CLARIFICATION. SO -- THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS IF YOU COULD JUST SORT OF RE CLARIFY FOR ME -- THE DEFINITION OF STORE A RETAILER OF LICENSE DEALER AND THE REASON WHY I ASKED THAT QUESTION IS BECAUSE IN AN ADJACENT DISTRICT JUST A MONTH AGO -- IN BEL AIR THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN SOMEONE WHO WAS I GUESS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MAN WAS DOING HE HAD OVER A THOUSAND GUNS. IN THIS HOME IN BEL AIR. NOT A SQUEAK OR P.. ABOUT THE INJUSTICE A BE NOT CHARGED. OKAY ON BAIL FOR FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. I COULD GET INTO A WHOLE OTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT YOU KNOW THE BIAS. IN THAT BUT I'M NOT GONNA SAVE THAT FOR ANOTHER BILL -- BUT I JUST WOULD LIKE TO GET SOME CLARIFICATION ABOUT YOU KNOW WHO. WOULD REALLY BE IMPACTED IN TERMS OF BEING A LICENSED DEALER BECAUSE SOME WOULD ARGUE THAT HE WAS NOT AND THEN I WOULD CERTAINLY NOT WANT THAT PERSON. TO BE EXEMPT FROM THIS WHICH WAS MY PREVIOUS QUESTION ABOUT NON COMPLIANCE AND PENALTIES BECAUSE THAT PERSON SHOULD BE CHARGED AND SHOULD BE GIVEN PENALTIES AND THAT HASN'T HAPPENED. WHAT? IF THIS THIS WOULD APPLY ONLY TO RETAIL DEAL RETAIL. DEALERS AND THOSE WHO SELL AT RETAIL FIREARMS AND IN THE GETTING BACK TO YOUR OTHER QUESTION JUST. TO THIS DOES NOT ADD ANY ADDITIONAL PENALTIES. IN TERMS OF THIS THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE EXISTING LAW AND IS CORRECTED IN A FIVE APPLY TO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HE'S SELLING GUNS OUT OF THE HOME HE'S NOT. YES AS WAS THE NFL. I YOU THERE'S NO NO LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF GUNS THE INDIVIDUAL CAN ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT THERE ARE SAFE STORAGE LAWS IRAQ -- BUT IF HE WAS WASN'T AN FFL -- I DON'T THINK HE WAS BREAKING THE LAW IN TERMS OF HAVING A LOT OF POSSESSING LOVE GUNS NOW HOW WE GOT THE GUNS HE PROBABLY WAS AND THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE BUT SOMEONE POSSESSING ON THANK YOU I WASN'T AWARE THAT HE WAS RE SELLING THEM IN. AT RETAIL. A TIME TO LEAVE. THE DEEP. TYLER. HE WAS CHAIRMAN AYE AYES HAVE A GUN. I GUESS A A AND AND OBSERVATION IN A QUESTIONS SOME. OF THE THE BILL BEFORE US IS SEEKING -- TO LIMIT GUN THAT GUNS THAT CAN BE STOLEN -- FOR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES. DO WE KNOW WHAT A JOB. THEN I HEARD DO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ANY ANYTHING -- IN OUR PENAL CODE THAT. PUNISH THOSE THAT ACTUALLY GO TO EIGHTY A GUN STORE AN STEAL GUNS. IS THERE SOMETHING IN THE PEORIA IT WITHOUT ITS OWN IN THE IN THE VEHICLE. IT'S A IT WOULD BE TH. TH FIFTH AFTER THAT BEARD THE BURGLARY OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE. OF LAWS AGAINST THAT YES. HAVE WE THOUGHT ABOUT -- DISCOURAGING. PEOPLE FROM STEALING GUNS MORE THAN JUST A KIND OF LIKE A PETTY THREAT FOR THE I DON'T KNOW THAT MAYBE A GOOD BILL BECAUSE I MEAN I'M. I'M I'M TRYING TO THINK OF IT THE WHOLE POINT IS TO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM. FROM STEALING GUNS -- SHOULD THE THE BURDEN B. E. VALLEY. DISTRIBUTED AMONGST GUN STORES OWNER AND CRIMINALS I DON'T THINK THAT IF IF THAT'S A QUESTION HAVE BEEN ANSWERED I DON'T THINK IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE THE GUN STORE OWNER. TO TO DEIDE WHAT PUNISHMENT SOMEONE SHOULD GET BUT IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A GUN STORE OWNER TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GUNS THAT THEY HAVE AND THE WEAPONS THAT THEY HAVE ARE PROTECTED FROM PEOPLE. FROM STEALING THEM AND FROM USING THEM -- AND GETTING THEIR BASICALLY CONTROL OF THOSE WEAPONS THE SECURITY OF THOSE WEAPONS IS BECAUSE OF THE AFFECT OF WITH THOSE WEAPONS CAN CAN DO. IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GUN STORE AND WE ARE PROVIDING THOSE OPPORTUNITIES IN THOSE OPTIONS FOR THOSE GUN STORE OWNERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE. WEAPONS ARE SECURE ARE SAFE OF FOR A PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE. THE SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN COME AND AND THAT MAKE WHATEVER A REST AND ALLOW THAT PERSON TO GO THROUGH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO -- I MEAN THIS IS A TOOL. TO REALLY HELP THE GUN STORE OWNER PROTECT THEIR WEAPONS FROM THE POSSIBLE LIABILITY THAT COULD COME FROM THE LOSS OF THOSE BY THEM NOT ACTING RESPONSIBLY. THANK YOU SENATOR. AND IT ACTUALLY. A COURT GENTLY IN THE GROVE BILL ACTUALLY STATES THAT GRANT THAT INVOLVES. THE DEATH OF A PIRATE IS PUNISHABLE BY IMPRISONMENT IN STATE PRISON FOR SIXTEEN MONTHS DO YOU TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS SO WE ALREADY HAVE.

GOOD MORNING ODD. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO US SENATE BILL TWO EIGHTY THREE WHICH WILL HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT UNDERSTAND AND QUANTIFY IT CAUSES BEHIND. FATAL COLLISIONS ON EVERY JOB. MAY CONTINUE YOU WANT ME TO DO I CLOSE. YOU KNOW THEY SAY DON'T TALK BEYOND THE DEAL SO ANYWAY -- DISCRETION CENTER. AS YOU KNOW MANY OF DRIVERS INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS THESE DAYS ARE IMPAIRED DUE TO ALCOHOL AND OR DRUG CONSUMPTION WELL LOCAL CORONERS AND MEDICAL EXAMINERS ARE REQUIRED DETAILS TO CEASE DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS FOR ALCOHOL CONTENT. BUT NOT FOR DRUG CONTENT SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LIKE ORANGE AND SEND IT SAN FRANCISCO HAVE VOLUNTARY BEGUN TESTING FOR DRUGS CONTENT. AFTER FATAL COLLISIONS BAD IT'S BELIEVE THAT IF WE DO THIS STATE WIDE WILL HAVE A BETTER DATABASE -- ON WHICH TO MAKE -- GOOD POLICY DECISIONS SB TWO EIGHTY THREE WILL UPDATE CURRENT LAW REQUIRING DRUG TESTING AFTER FATAL COLLISIONS IN ADDITION TO ALCOHOL TESTING. REFLECTING MORE ACCURATELY THE MODERN USE OF PRESCRIPTION A RECREATIONAL DRUGS I IT WILL REQUIRE TESTING IN CASES OF DEATH -- THAT OCCUR WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS OF THE COLLISION INSTEAD OF JUST TWENTY FOUR HOURS AND THAT ACTUALLY PROVIDES MORE DATA ON THE ON THE FATAL COLLISIONS I HAVE WITH ME TODAY. I IN SUPPORT IS ARIANNA IDEA ABOUT SUPERVISING FORENSIC SCIENTISTS AT THE ORANGE COUNTY CRIME LAB THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR I TECHNICAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE DRUG TESTING. OKAY ARIANNA YOU CAN MAKE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING -- I AM THE SUPERVISOR OF TOXICOLOGY AT THE ORANGE COUNTY CRIME LAB AND I WORKED THERE FOR ALMOST TWELVE YEARS. I'VE WITNESSED FIRSTHAND THE INCREASE IN DRUG PREVALENCE DUE TO THE LEGALIZATION OF MARIJUANA. THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC AND THE INCREASE -- IN PRESCRIPTION PILL USAGE. THIS BILL IS THE RESULT OF THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN ORANGE COUNTY AND THE SAN FRANCISCO MEDICAL EXAMINER'S OFFICE. THERE ARE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT GET TO MAKE A DECISION. ON WHETHER TO TEST FOR DRUGS IN FATALLY INJURED DRIVERS AND MOST ARE MAKING THE DECISION NOT. TO THE CURRENT LANGUAGE IN THE EXISTING LAW FOR FATALLY INJURED DRIVER TESTING HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED IN OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND CONTAINS OUTDATED REQUIREMENTS WE BELIEVE IT'S TIME TO UPDATE THE LAW TO MATCH CURRENT DRUG TRENDS SO THAT WE CAN APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED THE RISK. ASSOCIATED WITH IMPAIRED DRIVING. ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNOR'S HIGHWAY TRAFFIC ASSOCIATION. IT SAYS FATALITY ANALYSIS REPORTING SYSTEM ARE FARR'S FOR SHORT. REPORTED THAT DRUGS WERE PRESENT IN 43% OF THE FATALLY INJURED DRIVERS WITH A KNOWN TEST RESULTS. THIS WAS MORE FREQUENTLY THAN ALCOHOL WAS PRESENT. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PROVIDES INJURED DRIVE DATA DRIVER DATA RATHER TO FARCE. CURRENTLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ONLY OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE ALCOHOL RESULTS. THIS MEANS THAT THE DRUG IMPACT ON DRIVING AND FATAL INJURIES IS GROSSLY UNDERREPORTED. NOT ONLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT NATION WIDE. IN ORANGE COUNTY WE BEGAN TESTING ALL DRIVERS FOR THE PRESENCE OF DRUGS REGARDLESS OF BLOOD ALCOHOL CONTENT IN AUGUST OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND FROM THAT DATA WE HAVE COLLECTED WE FOUND THAT AT LEAST ONE DRUG IS PRESENT IN 46%. OF ALL DRIVERS TESTED IN OTHER WORDS ONE IN EVERY TWO DRIVERS ARRESTED FOR DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE HAVE AT LEAST ONE IMPAIRING DRUG IN THEIR SYSTEM. WHEN WE LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY DATA IT REGARDING FATALLY INJURED DRIVERS IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE SEE THAT 62% OF TESTED SAMPLES? ARE POSITIVE FOR AT LEAST ONE SUBSTANCE EITHER DRUGS OR ALCOHOL AND THIS IS A 6% INCREASE FROM. TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND A 12% INCREASE FROM. TWENTY SIXTEEN THE CURRENT LANGUAGE ONLY MANDATES TESTING FOR ALCOHOL AS I MENTIONED WITH THE SUGGESTION TO ALSO TEST FOR BARBITURATES AMPHETAMINE DERIVATIVES. BASED ON THE DATA ORANGE COUNTY HAS COLLECTED CANNABINOIDS ARE THE MOST PREVALENT DRUG AND ARE CALIFORNIA DRIVERS BEHIND ALCOHOL. AND CANNABINOIDS ARE FOLLOWED BY METHAMPHETAMINE. BENTO DAYS IT PEEN MEDICATION SUCH AS THE ANNEX. MORPHINE AND ALSO COCAINE. ALL OF THESE DRUGS WHICH ARE KNOWN TO CAUSE DRIVING IMPAIRMENT AND INCREASED RISK FOR TRAFFIC COLLISIONS -- ACROSS REQUIRING PROPER TESTING WILL HELP CALIFORNIA IN THE NATION TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUE PREVALENCE OF THE DRUG ISSUE. OF ALL OF THIS BILL UPDATE. CURRENT VERBIAGE IN THE EXISTING LAW TO TEST FOR THE MOST PREVALENT DRUGS ENCOUNTERED IN DRIVERS. AND THIS CAN PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION TO LEGISLATORS WHO CAN MAKE EVIDENCE BASED DECISIONS ON HOW TO BEST PREVENT TRAFFIC FATALITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING LUCIA MUCH CHARM BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CRIME LAB DIRECTORS AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. DAN YOUR TEARS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE -- WERE IN OPPOSITION ON THE BILL AND WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THE CALIFORNIA HAS NOT ESTABLISHED TESTING LEVELS THAT ESTABLISH IMPAIRMENT FOR SOME OF THESE DRUGS THAT WOULD BE COVERED. SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULD HAVE A DRUG IN YOUR SYSTEM BUT IT YOU COULD HAVE. ACTUALLY HAD THE DRUG A FEW DAYS BEFORE A FEW WEEKS BEFORE BUT STILL TEST POSITIVE FOR IT. AND WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE -- PROPER DATA WHEN WE'RE GOING INTO THESE THINGS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DO YOU. ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ROM THIS IS BAD SCIENCE. ALL RIGHT FIRST OF ALL. THIS IS BEEN DONE WELL IN EUROPE. BUT WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO FIRST IS DETERMINE. OF THOSE DRIVING. WHAT PERCENTAGE? HAVE FOR EXAMPLE AMPHETAMINES. YOU MAY FIND. THAT. AND THIS WAS FOUND THAT IN EUROPE. THERE'S ALMOST A 100% RISK OF AN ACCIDENT IF YOU HAVEN'T FEATHER MEANS THEY DO THIS BY SAMPLING THE DRIVER POPULATION. AND THEN SAMPLING THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS AND NOT JUST THOSE WHO HAPPEN TO DIE FURTHER. IT'S VERY CLEAR TO ME YOU'RE GOING AFTER. MARIJUANA IN PARTICULAR MARIJUANA CAN BE IN THE SYSTEM FOR DAYS AFTER YOU SMOKE IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU HAVE IMPAIRMENT. FURTHER. IT'S ALL MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE FOUND WITH MARIJUANA -- OFTEN ALSO FOUND. WITH. OTHER DRUGS PARTICULARLY ALCOHOL. UNLESS YOU COULD SEPARATE ALL OF THIS WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS CORRELATION. BUT THAT'S NOT CAUSATION THIS IS. JUST A OPEN SEASON. ON MARIJUANA THIS IS AN OPEN SEASON ON DOING BAD SCIENCE I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL I WILL BE VOTING NOW I'M SORRY THAT I'M A LITTLE BIT EXCITED ABOUT THIS. BUT I REALLY SEE THIS AS POOR SCIENCE. WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO DO IS WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN EUROPE FIND OUT? WHAT THE DRIVING POPULATION HAS AND THEN WHAT THE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN ACCIDENTS HALF NOT NECESSARILY THOSE? WHO HAVE DIED IN AN ACCIDENT WHO MAY WELL HAVE BEEN HIT BY SOMEBODY ELSE IT CETERA YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THE PEOPLE AT FAULT? AGAIN THIS LOOKS TO ME LIKE AN ATTACK ON CANNABIS AND I CANNOT ACCEPT THIS THANK YOU. ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SURE YOU MAY CLOSE. I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN -- SITES THAT WOULD NOT WITHSTANDING OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF CORPUS CON MAN SO I SEE THE BILL IS SOMETHING IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF JUST GATHERING DATA. HI IF NOT FOR POLICY REASONS FOR EDUCATION I'M NOT SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMBINATION OF AUG BEING -- CANNABIS USER AND THEN HAVING I'LL BURBAGE WELL SIR OPIOIDS BECAUSE OF PAIN WHATEVER OUR THAT COMBINATION IT CAN BE LETHAL WHEN THEY STEP BEHIND THE WHEEL IN MAINE THEY MAY NOT FEEL IT BECAUSE SOMETIMES THESE THINGS. DON'T HAVE A LASTING ABOUT SO WHEN I AM TO CALL THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE THE BILL THAT WAS MY THOUGHT -- BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT I'VE. ACQUIRED OVER ON SEVERAL SESSIONS HERE ALL LOOKING AT THE OPIOID ISSUE SO I THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD START I THINK THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE MENTIONED CERTAINLY SHOULD NOT BE ARE ABANDONED IN TERMS OF THE COOL. THE COLLECTION OF DATA AND TAKING A LOOK AT WHETHER THERE'S CAUSATIVE -- CAUSE OF THE FACT OR IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS SO CONSEQUENTIAL ODDS SO THOSE ARE THE REASONS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO MOVE FORWARD I KNOW LOSS VERY SIMILAR BILL IDEA TO LEAVE THE ASSEMBLY IS ON HIS WAY THE SENATE. THAT'S ASKING FOR THE SAME THING IT HAD UNANIMOUS SUPPORT HERE IT HAD CHAU CERTAINLY MY BILLS HAD UNAIMOUS SUPPORT ON THE OTHER SIDE SO THERE'S MERIT IN IT BOB THAT I DO TAKE YOUR CAUTIONARY COMMENTS. THAT LET'S MAKE SURE THAT IT'S USED IN THE PROPER MANNER AND I SEE THAT EDUCATION ALL CERTAINLY A LAW ENFORCEMENT ANY ON CERTAINLY ALL THE GENERAL PUBLIC IS IMPORTANT. SO I ASK FOR YOUR AYE BUILDING. SORRY ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU WE HAVE -- FIRST A SECOND THIS CALL FOR THE QUESTION. ON SB TWO EIGHTY THREE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. LACKEY LACKEY AYE BAR QUE HAN BAR QUE HAN I DEEP. DEEP I KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE NOT VOTING QUIRK NO QUIRK NO SANTIAGO. WICKS. WICKS NOT LOADING.

WHENEVER YOU'RE READY MAYBE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR HEARING THIS TODAY I WANT TO THANK YOU -- AND ALL YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING US WORKING WITH US AND SB. TWO THIRTY THREE WE'RE HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES PROPOSED AMENDMENTS -- AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT IF THEREARE PERHAPS TWO WEEKS TO THE WORDING A WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THAT BUT WE DO ACCEPT THOSE AMENDMENTS OF THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US. THANK YOU FOR EXCEPT IN I GUARANTEE WE WILL WORK YEAH COMMITTEE WILL WORK WITH TWO GREAT THANK YOU -- SO OUR COLLEAGUES -- SB TWO THIRTY THREE IS. VERY -- I BELIEVE COMMONSENSE A MEASURE TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY. OF SEX WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA OF THE BILL THOSE TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL IT -- CREATES -- INCENTIVES FOR SEX WORKERS TO COME FORWARD TO REPORT VIOLENT CRIME -- AS OPPOSED TO BEING DISSUADED FROM REPORTING VIOLENT CRIME FOR FEAR OF BEING THEMSELVES ARRESTED FOR SEX WORK -- AND IT HELPS ENSURE THAT SEX WORKERS HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO CARRY CONDOMS WITH THEM -- RIGHT NOW. SIX WORKERS UGH UGH FREQUENTLY DO NOT COME FORWARD TO REPORT VIOLENT CRIME WHETHER THEY ARE THE VICTIM OF A VIOLENT CRIME OR THEY ARE WITNESSING A VIOLENT CRIME -- BECAUSE THEY'RE FEARFUL THAT THEY WILL BE ARRESTED FOR A SEX WORK RELATED -- FENCES ARE WE OF THE SEX WORKERS ARE SIGNIFICANT INCREASED RISK OF BEING VICTIMIZED WHETHER IT'S ASSAULT OR RAPE. OR KIDNAPPING OR ROBBERY SO FORTH -- AND WE ALSO KNOW -- THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT FEAR THAT THEY'LL BE ARRESTED IF THEY COME FORWARD -- WHEN A SEX WORKER DOES NOT COME FORWARD TO REPORT OF VIOLENT CRIME -- DOT PUTS US ALL AT RISK BECAUSE IT MEANS OF SOMEONE WHO IS VIOLENT REMAINS OUT ON THE STREETS SO THE BILL WILL. PROVIDE THAT OF A SEX WORKER IS REPORTING A SPECIFIED LIST OF VIOLENT. CRIMES -- THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BE ARRESTED FOR A SEX WORK RELATED OFFENSES -- THE SECOND PIECE OF THE BILL HAS TO DO WITH POSSESSION OF CONDOMS -- UNFORTUNATELY THERE -- ARE STILL -- A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE THAT WILL USE CONDOM POSSESSION OF CONDOMS IS PROBABLE EVIDENCE OF PROBABLE CAUSE. OF THAT SOMEONE HAS COMMITTED SEX WORK AND CAN BE USED -- IN A COURT CASE -- ABOUT OF COURSE CREATES A HUGE INCENTIVE FOR SEX WORKERS NOT TO CARRY CONDOMS WITH THEM -- WE KNOW THE SEX WORKERS ARE AT INCREASED RISK OF SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED. INFECTIONS WHETHER HIV OR OTHER INFECTIONS. AND THE LAST THING WE SHOULD BE DOING -- IS TO CREATE A BIG INCENTIVE FOR THEM NOT TO CARRY A CONDOMS WITH THEM SO THE BILL OF RIGHTS THE CONDOMS ARE NOT EVIDENCE OF SEX WORK WHETHER FOR PROBABLE CAUSE -- OR IMPROVING -- A CASE -- IN COURT -- SO -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS -- BILL AND WITH ME TODAY ARE PEARL CALLAHAN -- AS WELL AS MINUTI KENDELL WITH THE ACLU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS MANY SCAM DOMON ATTORNEY WITH THE ACLU OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SB TWO THREE THREE IS AN ACTING BEST PRACTICES TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR SEX WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA. SB TWO THREE THREE IS INSPIRED IN PART BY A POLICY THAT WAS ENACTED IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING ON WHEN I WAS AT THE DEPARTMENT ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN STAFFING SAN FRANCISCO'S ANTI HUMAN TRAFFICKING TASK FORCE. AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE TASK FORCE THAT PERSONS IN COMMERCIAL SEX WHETHER BY CHOICE OR CIRCUMSTANCE OR COERCION WERE SUBJECT TO EXTREMELY HIGH LEVELS OF VIOLENCE SO FOR EXAMPLE IN ONE STUDY. 77% OF WOMEN IN THE SEX TRADE HAD REPORTED BEING RAPED AS ADULTS AND 49% REPORTED PHYSICAL ASSAULT FROM CLIENTS OR QUAINTON SAYS. AND FOR ST BASED TRANS GENDER AND PEOPLE OF COLOR SEX WORKERS -- THEY ARE PARTICULARLY AT RISK OF VIOLENCE AND YET A SENATOR WIENER HAS NOTED HAD NO DATE HAS NOTED MANY SEX WORKERS ARE RELUCTANT TO COME FORWARD AND REPORT THEIR CRIMES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE OF EXPERIENCES OF BEING CRIMINALIZED. AND THIS IS INCLUDES PERSONS TRAFFICKED IN COMMERCIAL SACKS WERE FROM TOLD BY THE PERSON WHO TRAFFIC THEM THAT THEY'LL BE ARRESTED IF THEY REACH OUT FOR HELP. AND SO -- SAN FRANCISCO ENACTED ITS POLICY IN EARLY TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND ALREADY THIS HAS RESULTED IN THE PROSECUTION OF A PERSON WHO VIOLENTLY KNIFED A SEX WORKER. AND THAT VICTIM WAS INITIALLY TERRIFIED TO TELL POLICE WHO HAD ATTACKED HER UNTIL SHE WAS LITERALLY SHOWN A COPY OF SAN FRANCISCO'S POLICY. SO SB THREE THREE TWO THREE THREE IS ESSENTIALLY CREATES A WAY FOR SEX WORKERS TO COME FORWARD AND SAY NEED -- TO IN ADDITION IN IT -- NUMEROUS GROUPS ARE SUPPORTING IT INCLUDING THE LESS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND NANCY O'MALLEY THE DA FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY HAD TO LEAVE BUT SHE ASKED ME TO SAY THAT THEIR OFFICES ALSO IN SUPPORT AND SHOULD BE GETTING A LETTER IN SOON. THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT PROVISION OF SB TWO THREE THREE DEALS WITH -- NOT PERMITTING CONDOMS TO BE USED TO CRIMINALIZE SEX WORKERS AND CURRENTLY WE HAVE A VERY CONTRADICTORY POLICY IN CALIFORNIA WHERE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE SPENDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DISTRIBUTE ENCOURAGE THE USE OF CONDOMS AND IN MANY OF THOSE SAME STRESSED ACTIONS. POLICE ARE USING THOSE SAME CONDOMS AS EVIDENCE TO ARREST PEOPLE FOR SEX WORK WHICH OBVIOUSLY CREATES A DISINCENTIVE FOR GREAT SEX WORKERS TO CARRY CONDOMS WHICH INCREASES RISKS OF HIV SEXUALLY TRANCE. HAD THE CONDOMS REMOVED FROM THEM BY POLICE SO WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB TWO THREE THREE SEX WORKERS SHOULD NOT BE CRIMINALIZED REPORTING VIOLENCE OR FOR CARRYING CONDOMS. MY NAME IS PEARL CALLAHAN. AND I'M A MEMBER OF THE SEX WORKERS OUTREACH PROJECT SACRAMENTO. I'VE BEEN A SEX WORKER FOR FORTY YEARS. I WAS TRAFFIC FOR TEN OF THOSE YEARS. I'M FROM SACRAMENTO AND FROM A PRETTY ROUGH SECTION OF TOWN MY FAMILY'S PORN FROM OAK PARK. I'M FROM THE MY FATHER SINGLE MAN WITH NINE KIDS RAISING US. I FOUND MYSELF PREGNANT AT AGE. SIXTEEN I DIDN'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO GO I HAD NO MONEY. I HAD A BOYFRIEND THAT WAS THIRTY YEARS OLD THE TOLD ME DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU. HE IS TAKING CARE OF ME WAS TO PUT ME ON THE STREET. AND WHEN HE PUT ME OUT THERE. I WASN'T ALLOWED TO USE CONDOMS HE WOULD NOT LET ME USE CONDOMS TO PROTECT MYSELF. BECAUSE HE SAID IF I GOT CAUGHT WITH THEM I GO TO JAIL AND IF I GO TO JAIL I CAN'T MAKE MONEY I CAN'T SUPPORT MY SON SO. THE VERY THING THAT WAS KEEPING. THE PUBLIC SAVE MY COMMUNITY SAVE ME SAFE I WASN'T ALLOWED TO USE THEM. AND THIS HAS TO STOP. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THEY HAVE A PROGRAM. IT'S CALL GETTING. TO ZERO AND THEIR GOAL IS. TO BY [inaudible] TWENTY ONE NO NEW [inaudible] HIV TRANSMISSIONS. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN WITHOUT US. IF I AM NOT SAFE THEN YOU'RE NOT SAFE. IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE PUBLIC KNOWS THAT. WHEN I'M AFFECTED IT AFFECTS ALL OF US? AND SO SB THIRTY SB TWO THIRTY THREE IS SO IMPORTANT. TO PROTECT. THE PUBLIC TO PUBLIC TO PROTECT ME TO PROTECT MY COMMUNITY. SO PLEASE VOTE YES ON THIS THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING GOING BACK AS FOR THE BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT.

TAKE A BREAK A NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORK CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN STRONG SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY TOMAR TALK OUT WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN SUPPORT. JAMES BIRCH. WITH THE SAINT JAMES INFIRMARY PROUD CO SPONSOR AND STRONG SUPPORT THANKS. CHRISTEN DEANGELO EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SEX WORKERS OUTREACH PROJECT SACRAMENTO ALSO CONSENSUAL SEX WORKER AND A SURVIVOR OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT IN MY ORGANIZATION AS AS WELL. JIM LIMBURGER ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION TO CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. I NEED A ROGERS A CO YOU IN STRONG SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MORNING MR TERM MEMBERS COURSE AS A LOW. WE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION REGRETTABLY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL I THINK WE HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS ARE ONLY THE ONES THAT FOCUS ON THE PROSECUTORIAL SIDE OBVIOUSLY TO MY COLLEAGUES. BUT I WOULD JUST NOTE WE WE WOULD ARGUE THAT WE BELIEVE THIS BILL -- DESPITE ITS GOOD INTENTIONS CREATES A SIGNIFICANT INCENTIVE -- FOR DRUG OFFENDERS ARE PEOPLE ENGAGED IN PROSTITUTION -- TO CLAIM THAT THEY ARE VICTIMS OR WITNESSES TO THE SPECIFIED CRIMES AS DEFINED IN THE AMENDMENTS -- THAT. THE BY REPORTING THIS VICTIM HOOD OR HAVING WITNESSED ANOTHER CRIME -- BY OPERATION OF THE BILL ABSOLVES THAT PERSON FROM THE ARREST FOR THE UNDERLYING DRUG OFFENSE OR PROSTITUTION OFFENSE -- I I THINK THE PROPONENTS OF SAID IN CONVERSATIONS THAT THE BAR TO THAT OR WHAT WILL AMELIORATE THAT IS THAT A PERSON WHO FALSELY CLAIM SUCH COULD BE SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION FOR A FALSE REPORT. BUT IT MAY NOT BE THE CASE THAT IT'S NOT TRUE IT JUST MAY NOT BE HAVE PROOF HAVE BEEN PROVEN AT THE POINT SO. IF A PERSON WHO'S ABOUT TO BE ARRESTED FOR PROSTITUTION SAYS I'M A VICTIM OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. PURSUANT TO THE OPERATIONS BILL THAT'S IT THEY CANNOT BE ARRESTED FOR THE PROSTITUTION. AND AT THAT POINT THEN IF THERE WERE ANY SORT OF RUBBER CAUTION FOR FALSELY REPORTING THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO BE AFTER THE FACT THE YOU HAVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS HUMAN TRAFFICKING SITUATION GOING ON IN. WHETHER OR NOT THAT PERSON WAS INDEED A VICTIM SO AGAIN IT'S IT'S IT'S MORE OF THE OPERATIONS IN THE LOGISTICS OF THE BILL THAT SAYS OKAY AT THIS POINT IN THE PROCESS IF YOU SEE THESE MAGIC WORDS. YOU ARE IMMUNE FROM ARREST THERE ARE OTHER POINTS IN THE PROCESS WHERE VICTIMHOOD OR THE FACT THAT. THAT PERSON'S BEEN WITNESS TO ONE OF THESE CRIMES CAN BE CONSIDERED -- AND AGAIN THAT'S MORE THE PRODUCT OR ROUND BUT FROM THE SUREST PERSPECTIVE I THINK TAKING AWAY INFORMATION -- FROM JUDGES JURIES PROSECUTORS LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THAT DECISION MAKE DECISIONS -- WITH THE FULL WEIGHT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND EVIDENCE IN THE TO TALLY OF CIRCUMSTANCES IMPORTANT. AND AGAIN FOR THOSE REASONS WITH ASPIN ABOUT THANK YOU THANK YOU. YES SIR GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS LAURIE MORSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. WHO WE ARE -- REGRETFULLY OPPOSED TO THIS BILL WHICH WOULD AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS PROHIBIT PROSECUTORS FROM USING CONDOMS AS EVIDENCE OF PROSTITUTION REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF A PARTICULAR CASE. THERE IS A STRONG PRESUMPTION IN FAVOR OF THE ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE IN OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM. IN FACT WITH RESPECT TO THE ADMISSIBILITY OF EVIDENCE IN A CRIMINAL CASE THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. PROVIDES THAT ALL EVIDENCE IS ADMISSIBLE EXCEPT BY A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE LEGISLATURE. SB TWO THIRTY THREE WOULD LEGISLATIVELY PROHIBIT CONDOMS FROM BEING USED AS EVIDENCE OF PROSTITUTION. LEWD ACTS IN PUBLIC LOITERING WITH THE INTENT TO COMMIT PROSTITUTION. AND COMMITTING A PUBLIC NUISANCE REGARDLESS OF CIRCUMSTANCES. CONDOMS WOULD ALSO BE PROHIBITED FROM BEING THE BASIS FOR PROBABLE CAUSE TO ARREST FOR THE SAME OFFENSE. CDA A BELIEVES THAT AN ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER OR NOT A CONDOM IS EVIDENCE IT SHOULD BE MADE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND THE COURTS AND THE DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT TO PROSECUTE IS BEST LEFT TO INDIVIDUAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES TO MAKE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. EXISTING LAW ALREADY PROVIDES AMPLE SAFEGUARDS BEFORE THE POSSESSION OF CONDOMS CAN BE INTRODUCED AS EVIDENCE. THAT A CRIME WAS COMMITTED. AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES BEFORE SUCH EVIDENCE IS ADMITTED. THE PROSECUTOR SHALL MAKE A WRITTEN MOTION TO THE COURT AND THE DEFENDANT STATING THAT THE PROSECUTOR HAS AN OFFER OF PROOF OF THE RELEVANCY. OF THE POSSESSION BY THE DEFENDANTS OF ONE OR MORE KHN. THE WRITTEN MOTION SHALL BE ACCOMPANIED ACCOMPANIED BY AN AFFIDAVIT CONTAINING THE OFFER OF PROOF AND SHALL BE FILED UNDER SEAL. AND ONLY AND SEALED BY THE COURT WHO DETERMINES IF THE OFFER OF PROOF IS SUFFICIENT TO ORDER HEARING. IF THE JUDGE DETERMINES THAT THE OFFER OF PROOF IS SUFFICIENT A HEARING IS HELD OUTSIDE THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY WERE THE OFFER OF PROOF CAN BE CHALLENGED BY THE DEFENSE. IF THE IF THE COURT FINDS AFTER SUCH A HEARING THAT THE OFFER OF PROOF IS RELEVANT AND NOT INADMISSIBLE THE COURT MAY THEN STATE WHAT EVIDENCE MAY ENTER MAYBE INTRODUCED BY THE PROSECUTOR. THOSE ARE SIGNIFICANT PROTECTIONS ALREADY IN LAW. IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO LEGALIZE SEX WORK. IT SHOULD INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO ACCOMPLISH THAT ENGAGE IN A PUBLIC DEBATE. ON THE ISSUE. INSTEAD OF NIBBLING AROUND THE EDGES OF THE ISSUE AND TELLING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROSECUTORS WHAT IS. AND ISN'T EVIDENCE. THE BILL ALSO PROVIDES IMMUNITY FOR DRUG CRIMES IN PROSTITUTION. TO ANYONE REPORTING SPECIFIED CRIMES WHETHER OR NOT ANY CORROBORATION OF THOSE ALLEGATIONS EXIST AS MY COLLEAGUES NOTED. WELL CITY A. L. CDA WELL RECOGNIZES AND APPRECIATES THE STRUGGLES AND PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS OF THOSE ENGAGED IN SEX WORK WE BELIEVE SB TWO THIRTY THREE IS BAD POLICY. AND ESTABLISHES A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MOVED WELL. MISS WICKS -- THANK YOU LACKEY. I JUST I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IN AND SHARING YOUR STORY -- THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL I'LL BE VOTING FOR TODAY AND I'D LIKE TO CO AUTHOR THANK YOU. MR LACKEY. YEAH. I THINK THIS AS SOON SO VERY ON NOTABLE THINGS TO CONSIDER WHAT ONE OF MY CONCERNS WAS BROUGHT FORWARD BY. THE OPPOSITION ON THE COOPERATION PIECE -- AND AND SEE IT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ACTUALLY MAKE SURE THAT HAVE -- SEX WORKERS ARE ENGAGED. AND WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING AND THAT THEY WITNESS AS A SIGNIFICANT CRIME THAT. THEY DO NEED TO BE ABSOLVED FROM. FROM THE RESPONSIBILITY IN PLACE AND REST HOWEVER. WE ALWAYS HAVE PRETENDERS RIGHT WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF AND IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE BILL OF THE COOPERATE TO TO HAVE. REQUIRES A CERTAIN DEGREE OF COOPERATION THAT ARE THERE WAS AN ACTUAL CRIME COMMITTED THAT THE REPORTING. THROUGH THE CHAIR ARM. I THANK YOU FOR THAT. QUESTION I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO TWO THINGS DISTINGUISH FIRST OF ALL OF THIS IS NOT ABOUT -- IN TERMS OF THE IMMUNITY FROM ARREST OUT THE CONDOM PEACE BUT THE REPORTING A CRIME PLEASE THIS IS NOT ABOUT IMMUNITY A TRIAL WHERE. YOU MIGHT TALK ABOUT NEEDING COOPERATION BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE SETTING OF A TRIAL THIS IS ABOUT A VERY QUICK DECISION THAT A POLICE OFFICER MAKES -- SHOULD I OR SHOULD I NOT ARREST THIS PERSON SO ON TO MY EYES IN A SCENARIO WHERE A SEX WORKER APPROACH IS A POLICE OFFICER -- AND SAYS I WAS ON MY I WAS JUST RATE ON AND OR I WAS JUST. ROBBED -- OR MY THAT MY JOHN -- JUST BEAT THE HECK OUT OF ME. I AND I THE THE OFFICER ON IT THIS IS NOT SOME SORT OF COURTROOM SETTING WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO SAY WHAT'S THE CORROBORATION RIGHT THERE MAKING A DECISION RIGHT THEN AND THERE. ON WHETHER TO ARREST AND I AND I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND WE'VE BEEN VERY FOCUSED WITH THE BILL'S VERY FOCUSED. THAT THE ONLY CRIMES THAT YOU REPORT THAT WOULD TRIGGER THIS ARE. ARE SERIOUS VIOLENT CRIMES LIKE RAPE LIKE KIDNAPPING LIKE HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AND THE CRIMES. THAT YOU FOR WHICH YOU ARE IMMUNIZED HARASSED OR CRIMES THAT I ARE NOT PARTICULARLY SERIOUS POSSESSION OF DRUGS. PROSTITUTION LOITERING BEING A NEW SENSE OF THE THESE ARE NAY SO WE WHEN YOU BALANCE -- WHAT WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT I MAKING IT AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO REPORT THE MOST HEINOUS CRIMES THAT ARE A THREAT TO THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY? OR POTENTIALLY IF SOMEONE DOES. HE OUGHT NOT HAVING THEM BE ARRESTED FOR LOITERING OR FOR COMMITTING A NEW SENSE I THINK WHEN YOU BALANCE THE RISK. THE RISK OF A VIOLENT PERSON BEING FREE ON THE STREET OR THE RISK OF NOT ARRESTING SOMEONE FOR ENGAGING IN LOITERING IT'S NOT EVEN A CLOSE CALL I WOULD RATHER WE ERR ON THE SIDE. OF PROTECTING NOT JUST THE SEX WORKERS BUT EVERYONE FROM A VIOLENT PERSON ON THE STREET AND AND SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S A NEED. FOR COOPERATION WHATEVER THAT WOULD MEAN HERE -- I THINK THAT WE STRUCK. A GOOD BALANCE I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE POINT OF SAYING BUT I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT BALANCE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY HERE. THIS WAS GONNA GET A THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I'M GLAD THAT YOU -- JUST MADE THOSE COMMENTS BECAUSE I SEE IT AS YOUR TRADING YOU KNOW A MISDEMEANOR FOR A FELONY -- AND WE WOULD MUCH RATHER BE FOCUSED ON THOSE -- YOU KNOW FELONY -- CHARGES AND CONVICTIONS AND I ALSO SORT OF AND I HEARD THE OPPOSITION -- AND I I CERTAINLY RESPECT WHAT YOU ALL ARE -- SAYING AND THAT YOU ARE HERE -- I ALSO THINK THOUGH IF YOU KNOW THE EVIDENCE THAT THE PROSECUTION IS WEIGHING ON IS YOU KNOW HAVING A STACK OF CONDOMS YOU KNOW IN YOUR PURSE OR IN YOUR POCKET THEN. THAT COULD BE A WEAK CASE MAY NOT BE BUT IT COULD BE -- AND SO I'M THANKFUL THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS FORWARD I TOO WOULD ASK TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENT. MISTER WEINER YOU MAY CLOSE -- I THANK YOU AND I DO -- I'VE EVERY RESPECT CDA DO YOU WANT TO JUST REITERATE THAT WE THE LOS ANGELES CA THE SAN FRANCISCO DA AND SOON TO BE THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DA THREE OF THE LARGEST. STATE -- COUNTIES IN THE STATE THREE OF THE COUNTIES -- THAT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT POPULATIONS SEX WORKERS THOSE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ARE ALL IN SUPPORT OF WILL BE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND IT IS. IN IN. I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND BOTH SHARES IN THE DA'S CONCERNED I MEAN I'M I'M. ONE IF YOU WERE TO TALK TO THE AUTHOR. OUT OF STOCKTON [inaudible] ON A NEIL EXCHANGES THAT WAS REALLY. DIFFICULT FOR ME [inaudible] TO TO STEPHEN HAD THAT BEEN HEARD IN MY COMMITTEE BECAUSE OF OBVIOUSLY GREATER GOOD BUT YOU ALSO DON'T WANT TO LEGALIZE PEOPLE. HAVING TO BE ABLE TO SHOOT UP BUT ONCE. IT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME ABOUT THE GREATER GOOD OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO -- EIGHT IT SOFTENED ME AND GOT ME. IF CLOSER TO ULTIMATELY RECOMMEND IMPROVE NOT ONLY JUST COMMITTEE AND IN VOTING FOR ON THE FLOOR -- AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT IF SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING ILLEGAL THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS NOT THEIR HANDS ARE TIED THAT THEY CAN'T GO AHEAD AND AN ARREST SOMEONE IT -- PROSECUTE THEM OF THE PART THAT I THINK REALLY HELPS AND WE MAY NEED TO FURTHER EXPLAIN IS. SALAS MORE PROACTIVE IT'S NOT YOU GET BUSTED IN YOU'RE TRYING TO GET OUT OF SOMETHING. YOU. YOU AS OF SEX FOR HER. GO TO LAW ENFORCEMENT A REPORT A CRIME. SIMILAR TO A BILL THAT I DID FOUR PEOPLE WERE IMMIGRANT. THEY REPORT A CRIME. BUT YOU DON'T ARREST HIM FOR NOT BEING -- PART OF THIS COUNTRY OR YOU DON'T HAVE THE ICE AGES COME AND GET YOU BECAUSE A REPORTER VERY HEINOUS CRIME YOU WANT TO REPORT MURDER AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. AND SO WE WE PROVIDE AN PROTECTIONS. IT'S KIND OF FALLS INTO IN THE SAME VEIN THAT DO YOU WANT TO PROTECT PEOPLE. AND SO I I GET WE TRY TO GO AND HOPEFULLY YOU CAN YOU WILL CONTINUE TALKS WITH. WITH THE WITH OFFICE BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU'RE I KNOW I DON'T THINK I KNOW YOUR INTENT. IS NOT. TO BECAUSE THE MANY PROBLEMS IN DOING DIRECTOR TO DATE A JOB TO TO REDUCE -- THINGS AND WHATNOT OBVIOUSLY THIS COMMITTEE IS NOT. AT LEAST TODAY. WE'RE NOT HAVING TO DISCUSSION ABOUT LEGALIZING -- CERTAIN AXE RIGHT NOW -- I GUESS IT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE BY GOOD DEFINITELY THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO DAY.
