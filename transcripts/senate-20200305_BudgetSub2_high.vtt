00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.963
TO GROUP SERVICE. INTO

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.497
COMPONENTS THE PUBLIC CAN

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:53.833
UNDERSTAND. AND IF YOU ROLL

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.868
OVER TO THE NEXT SLIDE. WHICH

00:08:55.935 --> 00:08:57.603
HAS A PICTURE OF ONE OF OUR

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.272
OFFICERS WITH BINOCULARS. WE

00:08:59.338 --> 00:09:01.140
TOOK THOSE EIGHT SERVICE AREAS

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.575
IN OVER THE LAST YEAR WE'VE

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:04.543
DONE THESE THINGS. HERE'S THE

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.379
CORE SERVICE BASED BUDGETING

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:08.614
YOU LIST OUT EVERY TASK THE

00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:11.083
BUSINESS DOES. WE CAME UP WITH

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:13.052
THE TASK REGISTRY OF ALMOST

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:15.588
THREE THOUSAND TASKS. THEN YOU

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:18.190
FIGURE OUT WHAT LABOR HOURS ARE

00:09:18.257 --> 00:09:20.927
BEING SPENT ON EACH TASK. AND

00:09:20.993 --> 00:09:22.929
THEN YOU COMPARE THE SERVICE

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:25.498
CURRENTLY AGAINST AN ESTIMATE

00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:27.466
OF WHAT YOUR SERVICE WOULD BE

00:09:27.533 --> 00:09:28.100
IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY HITTING YOUR

00:09:28.167 --> 00:09:30.736
MISSION. ALL YOUR MANDATES.

00:09:30.803 --> 00:09:32.905
THAT'S WHAT WE ARE ENGAGED IN

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:34.573
AND HAVE COMPLETED AS OF LAST

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.076
YEAR. THAT TAKES YOU TO THE

00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:39.412
NEXT SLIDE SLIDE FIVE WHICH IS

00:09:39.478 --> 00:09:40.646
KIND OF THE BEGINNING OF THE

00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:42.348
MONEY SLIDE IF YOU WILL IN THE

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:44.483
SENSE THAT WHAT YOU GET AFTER

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.852
DOING THAT EXERCISE. IS AN

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:50.056
ABILITY TO FIGURE OUT THE GAS.

00:09:50.122 --> 00:09:53.092
BETWEEN WHERE YOU ARE AND WHERE

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:54.460
YOU'RE COMMUNITY EUREX COLONEL

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:57.129
FOLKS AND YOUR BUSINESS

ENTERPRISE THINK YOU NEED TO BE.

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:01.667
BUT IMPORTANTLY YOU DON'T HAVE

00:10:01.734 --> 00:10:03.436
TO FILL A GAP JUST ADDING LABOR

00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:06.405
HOURS. THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO

00:10:06.472 --> 00:10:08.074
DEAL WITH YOUR GAP PROBLEMS YOU

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.910

00:10:10.977 --> 00:10:14.313
MANDATES. YOU CAN ACHIEVE

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:17.049
PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS YOU CAN

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:18.651
INCREASE YOUR PARTNERSHIPS

00:10:18.718 --> 00:10:22.388
WHICH CAN BRING DOWN YOUR GAP.

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:22.955
YOU CAN INVEST IN TECHNOLOGY

00:10:23.022 --> 00:10:24.657
AND EQUIPMENT OF COURSE YOU

00:10:24.724 --> 00:10:27.360
COULD DO LABOR AS WELL. SO WHAT

00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:28.828
YOU'LL SEE IN THE NEXT SLIDE

00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:30.363
WHICH IS TOTAL PRELIMINARY DATA%

THE ONE TIME INVESTMENTS THAT

00:31:57.715 --> 00:31:59.884
ANTIQUATED. I HAVE NO ISSUES

00:31:59.951 --> 00:32:01.386
WITH THAT. I JUST HAVE ISSUES

00:32:01.452 --> 00:32:03.388
WITH THE RATING OF THE EIGHT

00:38:15.593 --> 00:38:17.695
THE COST OF DOING NOTHING EVEN

00:38:17.762 --> 00:38:19.096
THOUGH I BELIEVE THERE'S A

00:38:19.163 --> 00:38:21.699
LEGITIMATE. COST OF DOING

00:38:21.766 --> 00:38:24.201
NOTHING. THERE'S AN ACTUAL

00:38:24.268 --> 00:38:26.504
DEFINITION WE USED WITHIN

SCIENCE RELATIVE TO ACHIEVING

00:38:46.957 --> 00:38:49.360
THOSE ASSIGNMENTS. THINK ABOUT

00:38:49.427 --> 00:38:51.962
THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF DOING

00:38:52.029 --> 00:38:53.397

PART OF THEIR WORK WITH THE

BUT THEN THEY'RE GONNA CUT THE

00:50:08.238 --> 00:50:12.042
REST THE- FUNDING TOGETHER. IT

00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:14.811
IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. WAS

00:50:14.878 --> 00:50:15.412
SOMETHING. AND ASSEMBLY THAT

00:50:15.479 --> 00:50:17.748
MONEY. INTO THE FIND. MAY OR

00:50:22.786 --> 00:50:23.587
SEEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT THEY

00:50:23.653 --> 00:50:27.491

00:50:27.557 --> 00:50:31.828
FORGETTING. CHEN FUND. AND

00:50:31.895 --> 00:50:34.131
WOULD SIMPLY SAY THAT I'M ALSO.

00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:34.965
ABOUT THE- AT W. B. AND THE

00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:35.999
FACT THAT A BUNCH OF MONEY SO

00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:36.633
THEY CAN JUST YOU KNOW PROP UP

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.568
THE MONEY THE FUNDS THAT WE'RE

00:50:38.635 --> 00:50:39.636
NOT GOING TO SEND MONEY TO

00:50:39.703 --> 00:50:40.971
THROUGH THE H. C. F. I WOULD

00:50:41.037 --> 00:50:43.240
POINT OUT THAT THE W. CD'S. CF

00:50:43.306 --> 00:50:45.642
FIND IS SPENT ACT. EVERY YEAR

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:47.411
IT'S NOT THAT'S NOT MONEY THAT

00:50:47.477 --> 00:50:48.044
SITS AROUND THAT'S MONEY THAT

00:50:48.111 --> 00:50:49.646
CRANKS OUT VERY QUICKLY AND

00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:52.649
GOES TO THE AREAS THAT NEED IT

00:50:52.716 --> 00:50:53.216
AND A LOT TIMES AREAS THAT

00:50:53.283 --> 00:50:54.217
DON'T BENEFIT FROM BOND

00:50:54.284 --> 00:50:56.720
FUNDING. BUT FRANKLY. I'M LIKE

00:50:56.787 --> 00:50:58.655
NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE AND

00:50:58.722 --> 00:50:59.189
NOT SOME OF THE MORE RURAL

00:50:59.256 --> 00:51:00.757
PARTS OF THE STATE. AND SO I

00:51:00.824 --> 00:51:02.125
GUESS WHAT I WOULD JUST ASK IS

00:51:02.192 --> 00:51:04.327

AGREE THE ONE TIME FUNDING THAT

00:51:10.801 --> 00:51:11.535
THEY'RE PROPOSING IS ABSOLUTELY

00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:13.570
CRITICAL. THE EXTENSION OF THE

00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:14.070
THIRTY MILLION THAT WAS

00:51:14.137 --> 00:51:15.539
PROMISED DURING THE LAST BUDGET

00:51:15.605 --> 00:51:17.808

PROGRAM WOULDN'T BE IMMENSELY

00:51:30.353 --> 00:51:31.988
BENEFICIAL. FOR LOTS OF THINGS

00:51:32.055 --> 00:51:34.124
THAT WE WORK ON WOLVES. THE

00:51:34.191 --> 00:51:35.625
AMOUNT LINES IF THEY'RE LISTED.

00:51:35.692 --> 00:51:37.661

SPECIES THAT ARE LISTED NOW OR

00:51:39.362 --> 00:51:40.764
ARE GOING TO NEED TO BE LISTED

00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:42.299
IN THE FUTURE. WE NEED THOSE

00:51:42.365 --> 00:51:43.900
BIOLOGISTS BECAUSE QUITE

00:51:43.967 --> 00:51:45.836
FRANKLY. RIGHT NOW THE

PROGRAM. WHICH IS CRAZY WHEN

00:51:52.342 --> 00:51:53.310
YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'RE

00:51:53.376 --> 00:51:54.744
FACING RIGHT NOW WITH THE STATE

BE AUGMENTED. THE HABITAT

00:52:01.184 --> 00:52:03.386
CONSERVATION FUND IS NOT THE

I'M CONCERNS AS THE DRAFTERS OF

TAKING AWAY THE FUND- DOES NOT

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.555

EXTENDING REPEALING THE END

00:53:14.224 --> 00:53:16.760
DATE. OF THE FIND IT DOES NOT

00:53:16.826 --> 00:53:17.460
ACTUALLY ALLOW FOR ELIMINATING

THOSE WEREN'T SUFFICIENT LEGAL

00:53:22.265 --> 00:53:24.134

WITHOUT THE FUNDING TO COMPLETE

01:02:58.141 --> 01:02:59.909
THE ASSIGNMENT. THIS IS AN

01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:02.478
EXAMPLE. I SUPPOSE THE

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:03.613
LEGISLATURE COULD HAVE

01:03:03.679 --> 01:03:05.281

01:03:05.348 --> 01:03:07.617
PERMANENT MORATORIUM BUT THE

01:03:07.683 --> 01:03:09.485
BILL IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:12.922
THAT IN OUR JUDGMENT I RESPECT

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:14.657
THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:17.293
DECIDE NOT TO FUND THIS BUT FOR

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.861

DISCRETION WITHIN THE

JUST WANTED TO COME UP AND

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.796
SPIEGEL. ON THIS ISSUE SO WE

WERE PART OF THE COALITION LAST

01:06:08.397 --> 01:06:09.699
YEAR THAT OPPOSE THIS

01:06:09.765 --> 01:06:11.901
LEGISLATION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE.

01:06:11.967 --> 01:06:13.402
THAT THESE DECISIONS ARE BEST

01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:15.104
TO REMAIN VESTED WITH THE FISH

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:17.206
AND GAME COMMISSION. THERE

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:18.207
VESTED WITH THE AUTHORITY TO

01:06:18.274 --> 01:06:19.608
MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT GAME

01:06:19.675 --> 01:06:22.311
SPECIES IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT I'M

HUNTING BOBCAT AND WATER FELL

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:30.019
WITHIN THE CLIENTS- BUT THERE

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:32.922
ARE SOME THAT DO. AND THERE'S A

01:06:32.988 --> 01:06:33.823
BODY THAT'S APPOINTED BY THE

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:35.958
GOVERNOR IT WORKS WITH THE

01:06:36.025 --> 01:06:36.959
DEPARTMENT ON THE BASIS OF

01:06:37.026 --> 01:06:38.661
SCIENCE TO HELP MAKE THOSE

01:06:38.728 --> 01:06:41.130
DECISIONS. THE LEGISLATURE FOR

01:06:41.197 --> 01:06:43.032
THE FIRST TIME LAST YEAR REMOVE

01:06:43.099 --> 01:06:46.902
THAT STORY FROM THEM WITH THIS

01:06:46.969 --> 01:06:50.539
BILL BUT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SO.

01:06:50.606 --> 01:06:51.640
PROCESS IN GENERAL. AS WE WENT

01:06:51.707 --> 01:06:54.210
THROUGH THE DOOR ON THIS BILL.

01:06:54.276 --> 01:06:55.611
IT BECAME CLEAR THAT WE WERE

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:56.712
NOT GOING TO DO THE SCIENCE

01:06:56.779 --> 01:06:58.447
FIRST. AND THEN TALK ABOUT

01:06:58.514 --> 01:07:00.182
WHETHER BàN WAS APPROPRIATE

01:07:00.249 --> 01:07:01.884
WE'RE GOING TO DO A BAND. AND

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:02.718
THEN TRY TO FOLLOW AT THE

01:07:02.785 --> 01:07:04.854
SCIENCE SO WE SEE THIS AS- A

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.489
LOGICAL CONCLUSION TO THE WAY

01:07:06.555 --> 01:07:07.590
THAT THE CHAIR OF THE

01:07:07.656 --> 01:07:08.924
APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE MR

01:07:08.991 --> 01:07:10.693
PORTANTINO ALLOW THE BILL TO

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:11.594
MOVE THROUGH HIS COMMITTEE AT

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:12.895
THE END OF THE YEAR. SO WE

01:07:12.962 --> 01:07:14.764
WOULD ASK. THAT YOU APPROVE THE

01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:16.966
FUNDING SO THAT THE SCIENCE CAN

01:07:17.032 --> 01:07:18.401
BE DOWN AGAIN WE WOULD ARGUE

01:07:18.467 --> 01:07:19.902
THAT THE PROCESS WAS DONE.

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:22.705
BACKWARDS DOT NET SIGN SHOULD

01:07:22.772 --> 01:07:25.841
BE THE REASON WHY IN THE

01:07:25.908 --> 01:07:26.742
JUSTIFICATION WHY GAMES.

01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:28.577
MANAGEMENT IS CHANGING THE- SO

01:07:28.644 --> 01:07:29.512
CAN YOU WONDER WHY IS

01:07:29.578 --> 01:07:30.846
CALIFORNIA WATER FELL IF YOU'RE

01:07:30.913 --> 01:07:32.548
MAKING A COMMENT. IN TWO

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:33.282
THOUSAND AND THREE SOMEBODY

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:34.917

TWO THOUSAND AND THREE IN RIGHT

01:07:37.586 --> 01:07:39.221
SO THERE ARE THESE DECISIONS

01:07:39.288 --> 01:07:40.322
AND DISCUSSIONS THAT TAKE

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:42.658
PLACE. THAT CAN IMPACT SOME OF

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:44.126
THE DEPARTMENT'S OWN PRIORITIES

LOOKED AT THIS AND DIDN'T HAVE

01:18:22.664 --> 01:18:24.933
ANY MAJOR CONCERNS AND- WE WERE

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:25.934

01:20:29.157 --> 01:20:30.592
FIRE SIMULATOR CURRENTLY

SCHEDULE- PROPOSED TO GO TO CAL

01:20:32.794 --> 01:20:35.463
FIRES ACADEMY. IS A LIVE FIRE

01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:37.332
SIMULATOR SO OUR OFFICERS WOULD

PLAY THEIR FORCE OPTIONS AS

01:20:44.706 --> 01:20:45.907
APPROPRIATE BASED ON THE

01:20:45.974 --> 01:20:47.876
SCENARIOS OF BASS BASS. WITHIN

01:20:47.943 --> 01:20:49.444
THEIR- ENDED WITH IN THE

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:50.779
SCENARIOS ARE INDIVIDUAL

01:20:50.845 --> 01:20:52.480
CONTACTS OF THE THOUSANDS OF

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:54.282
POTENTIAL OUTCOMES WHICH PUT

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:56.051
THOSE OFFICERS DIRECTLY IN THE

01:20:56.117 --> 01:20:57.819
FACE OF THE NECESSITY OR OR

01:20:57.886 --> 01:21:00.355
LACK THEREOF TO. BE UTILIZED

01:21:00.422 --> 01:21:02.691
FOR. ELECTRONIC SIMULATORS WORK

01:21:02.757 --> 01:21:03.725
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WHEN

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:05.260
YOU'RE- TALKING ABOUT THE LIVE

01:21:05.327 --> 01:21:07.128
FIRE TRAINING SIMULATOR AND ITS

01:21:07.195 --> 01:21:09.431
LOCATION OF OFFER ATOMI.

01:21:09.497 --> 01:21:11.166
COMPLIMENTS ARE EXISTING TRAIN

01:21:11.233 --> 01:21:14.202
PLATFORMS THAT ARE BETTER SO WE

01:21:14.269 --> 01:21:16.104
CAN. RUN NUMEROUS STUDENTS

01:21:16.171 --> 01:21:18.206
THROUGH A FAST PACE TAKE THEM

01:21:18.273 --> 01:21:19.608
OUT BUT IN A MINUTE PUTTING

01:21:19.674 --> 01:21:20.742
THEM IN A THREE DIMENSIONAL

01:21:20.809 --> 01:21:22.777
SCENARIO BASED TRAIN BECAUSE WE

01:21:22.844 --> 01:21:25.413
HAVE THE FACILITIES ARE TO DO

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:26.748
IT. ANY ADDITIONAL RAIN SPACE.

01:21:26.815 --> 01:21:28.283
WE CAN SAFELY OPERATE MULTIPLE

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:30.585
SCENARIOS AND RUN NUMEROUS

01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:33.188
STUDENTS THROUGH. AT ONE POINT-

01:21:33.255 --> 01:21:35.890
JUST MAKE SURE I'M TRACKING

01:21:35.957 --> 01:21:37.859
BECAUSE I WANNA MAKE SURE

01:21:37.926 --> 01:21:38.460
TALKING ABOUT THE SAME TYPE OF

01:21:38.526 --> 01:21:40.595
THE SIMULATOR. BUT I'M ASSUMING

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:41.596
YOU ALREADY HAVE SIMULATORS

01:21:41.663 --> 01:21:45.100
THAT ARE DESIGNED TO FIGHT FIRE

01:21:45.166 --> 01:21:45.667
DO STRUCTURE FIRE LIKE I SAW

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:49.104
OUT HERE. YOU DO NOT HAVE ONE

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:51.172
THAT IS A SIMULATOR THAT. THEY

01:21:51.239 --> 01:21:52.874
PUT YOU IN A SITUATION WHERE

01:21:52.941 --> 01:21:54.276
YOU MAY HAVE TO USE FORCE.

01:21:54.342 --> 01:21:56.578
THAT'S WAT THIS IS ABOUT. NOW

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:58.780
MY THIRD QUESTION WOULD BE.

01:21:58.847 --> 01:22:01.082
DOES THE CHP OR- I'M ASSUMING

01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:02.484
THERE'S OTHER AGENCIES THAT

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:04.252
HAVE THESE ALREADY OR THEY DO.

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:06.588
SO THERE'S NO ABILITY TO BE

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:08.657
ABLE TO CROSS OVER AND- USE

01:22:08.723 --> 01:22:10.959
THOSE OR IS IT ARE THESE MEANT

01:22:11.026 --> 01:22:12.494
IN IN MY MIND THAT. THE

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.696
TAXPAYERS PAY IN. TWO FOUR C.

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:18.233
H. P. FISHING GAME WARDEN YOU

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:21.069
NAME IT YOU CAL FIRE. SO IT IS

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:22.637
OUR LACK OF THESE OF AVAILABLE

01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:23.905
TO THOSE OTHER AGENCIES THAT WE

01:22:23.972 --> 01:22:26.041
COULD USE WITH EACH OTHER OR IS

01:22:26.107 --> 01:22:27.008
THIS THE FIRST ONES OUT OF THE

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:29.878
GATE. THAT ARE AVAILABLE. THERE

01:22:29.944 --> 01:22:31.413
ARE OTHER TRAIN SIMULATORS

01:22:31.479 --> 01:22:32.480
AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:22:32.547 --> 01:22:34.149
BY INDIVIDUAL AGENCIES OR

01:22:34.215 --> 01:22:35.850
REGIONAL TRAINING CENTERS. THE

01:22:35.917 --> 01:22:39.120
NUMBER OF THOSE QUALITY OF

01:22:39.187 --> 01:22:39.688
THOSE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:22:39.754 --> 01:22:42.524
THOSE. AS WE PROGRESS FORWARD

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:44.893
OUR BEHIND SO THAT'S WHY WE IS

01:22:44.959 --> 01:22:47.095
A AGENCIES- AS A GROUP OF

01:22:47.162 --> 01:22:50.265
AGENCIES ARE ASKING FOR TRAIN

01:22:50.332 --> 01:22:51.733
SIMULATOR SPUR THE USE MONTHS

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:55.637
ARE AGENCIES. AS WELL AS WHAT.

01:22:55.704 --> 01:22:58.173
IF I MAY SENATOR THERE'S A

01:22:58.239 --> 01:23:00.375
COUPLE POINTS THERE TO THAT THE

01:23:00.442 --> 01:23:02.544
MOST CURRENT TECHNOLOGY NOT

01:23:02.610 --> 01:23:05.580
SIMULATOR TRAINING THAT WAS

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:06.114
POTENTIALLY PRIOR TO THIS

THIS IS REALLY LOOKING AT THE

01:43:16.256 --> 01:43:18.191
HUNDRED AND FIFTY- WEATHER

01:43:18.258 --> 01:43:20.160

SYSTEM STATIONS THAT COMPLEMENT

01:43:25.999 --> 01:43:27.734
THOSE. SERVICE WATER GAUGES-

01:43:27.801 --> 01:43:29.236
THESE ARE LARGELY PLACED IN

01:43:29.303 --> 01:43:30.537
AGRICULTURAL AREAS ACROSS THE

PARTICULAR NEEDS BETWEEN. A

01:43:37.945 --> 01:43:39.580
WHEN IS THE BEST TO FOR SERVICE

01:43:39.646 --> 01:43:41.515
WATER VERSES GROUNDWATER WHAT

01:43:41.582 --> 01:43:43.450
IS THE WEATHER LOOKING LIKE IN

01:43:43.517 --> 01:43:44.318
THIS MOMENT WHAT'S COMING OUR

01:43:44.384 --> 01:43:46.920
WAY. WHERE IS THE SNOW PACK

01:43:46.987 --> 01:43:48.288
WHERE'S THE PRECIPITATION THIS

01:43:48.355 --> 01:43:49.957
REALLY IS A COMPLIMENT IF YOU

01:43:50.023 --> 01:43:51.758
WELL TO THAT- PREVIOUS ITEM YOU

01:43:51.825 --> 01:43:54.828
VOTED ON. HOW DOES ONE MAINTAIN

01:43:54.895 --> 01:43:58.465
OR OUR SERVICE A GAUGE WHAT'S

01:43:58.532 --> 01:44:01.435
WHAT IT I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT

01:44:01.501 --> 01:44:02.603
THAT IS. YEAH SO THE- IT WAS A

01:44:02.669 --> 01:44:04.438
THAT IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS ONE

01:44:04.504 --> 01:44:06.473
IS SIMPLY GETTING THERE. SO

01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:08.108
JUST LIKE THE STREAM GAGES AT

01:44:08.175 --> 01:44:09.242
THE SAME A STATION'S WEATHER

01:44:09.309 --> 01:44:10.877
STATIONS ARE LOCATED GENERALLY

01:44:10.944 --> 01:44:12.446
IN PRETTY REMOTE AREAS SOME ARE

01:44:12.512 --> 01:44:13.614
LESS REMOTE IF THEY'RE ACTUALLY

01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:14.481
ON I I'M YOUR GATED

01:44:14.548 --> 01:44:16.717
AGRICULTURAL. AREAS BUT SOME

01:44:16.783 --> 01:44:20.087
ARE. VERY MUCH- FAR FLUNG. I'M

01:44:20.153 --> 01:44:21.989
ACROSS THE ACROSS THE STATE WE

01:44:22.055 --> 01:44:23.357
REALLY DO NEED IS INFORMATION

01:44:23.423 --> 01:44:25.058
STATEWIDE AND SO JUST GETTING

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:26.827
THERE SO TRANSPORTATION- THAT

01:44:26.893 --> 01:44:29.162
REQUIRES VEHICLES OF COURSE-

01:44:29.229 --> 01:44:30.530
BUT BY THINK PREDOMINATELY TO

01:44:30.597 --> 01:44:32.032
YOUR QUESTION IT REALLY IS THE-

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:35.102
THESE ARE. HIGHLY ADVANCED-

01:44:35.168 --> 01:44:38.271
MONITORING STATIONS SO IT'S

01:44:38.338 --> 01:44:40.040
WIND SPEED TEMPERATURE OF WATER

01:44:40.107 --> 01:44:43.176
QUALITY PRECIPITATION SNOW MELT.

01:44:43.243 --> 01:44:44.444
I'M JUST TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE

01:44:44.511 --> 01:44:46.680
SNOW FALL YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE

01:44:46.747 --> 01:44:47.948
TO HAVE A VERY SENSITIVE

01:44:48.015 --> 01:44:51.518
MACHINE THAT NOT ONLY AS A AS A

01:44:51.585 --> 01:44:54.388
PAD IF YOU WILL TO CATCH SO.

01:44:54.454 --> 01:44:56.089
AND SNOWFALL BUT ALSO HAS TO BE

01:44:56.156 --> 01:44:58.291
ABLE TO BE ABLE TO- HAVE THAT

01:44:58.358 --> 01:44:59.826
MELTING AWAY THAT THAN THAT

01:44:59.893 --> 01:45:01.728
AMOUNT OF SNOW BASED OFF OF

01:45:01.795 --> 01:45:03.897
BOTH THE WATER CONTENT ANN'S

01:45:03.964 --> 01:45:05.265
WEIGHT IS MEASURED CALCULATED

01:45:05.332 --> 01:45:07.134
SO A LOT OF VERY SENSITIVE

01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:08.068
TECHNOLOGIES WHAT I'M TRYING TO

01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:09.670
GET ACROSS HERE. THAT JUST LIKE

01:45:09.736 --> 01:45:11.405
OUR AUTOMOBILES REQUIRES

01:45:11.471 --> 01:45:14.374
CONSTANT VIGILANCE- UPDATING

01:45:14.441 --> 01:45:15.709
UPGRADING AND MAINTENANCE TO

01:45:15.776 --> 01:45:16.843
MAKE SURE THEY WERE GETTING THE

01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:17.678
MOST ACCURATE INFORMATION

01:45:17.744 --> 01:45:19.212
POSSIBLE IF IT'S NOT ACCURATE

01:45:19.279 --> 01:45:21.448
IT'S NOT REALLY USEFUL WHY I

01:45:21.515 --> 01:45:23.083
GET THAT WHEN YOU GO OUT AND

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:26.353
YOU HAVE A- PORTABLE. HI AM

01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:28.088
GADGET IN YOU AND YOU DO THE

01:45:28.155 --> 01:45:29.723
MEASUREMENT WERE THAT LEASE

01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:32.959
THIS PCP BCP TALKS ABOUT TWENTY

01:45:33.026 --> 01:45:34.394
STREAM CAGES THAT ARE OUT THERE

01:45:34.461 --> 01:45:36.063
ALREADY YOU WANT TO YOU WANT

01:45:36.129 --> 01:45:37.831
STAFF AND YOU WANT SOME MONEY

01:45:37.898 --> 01:45:40.133
TO GO MAINTAIN THEM IS IT A

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:42.135
MATTER JUST SIMPLE CALIBRATION

01:45:42.202 --> 01:45:43.370
TO MAKE SURE ITS OPERATING

01:45:43.437 --> 01:45:46.973
RIHT OR- IS IT. ARE THESE. IN

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:48.875
THE WORLD OF STREAM GAUGES

01:45:48.942 --> 01:45:51.044
SISTER SOME NEW ELEMENT THAT

01:45:51.111 --> 01:45:52.446
GOES IN THAT YOU REPLACE LIKE

01:45:52.512 --> 01:45:54.581
A- YOU KNOW. AN AUTOMOBILE YOU

01:45:54.648 --> 01:45:56.149
TAKE THIS PART OUT YOU PUT THIS

01:45:56.216 --> 01:45:57.517
PART IN IN THAT IT PROVIDES

01:45:57.584 --> 01:46:00.353
DATA. AND YOU KNOW I ASSUME WE

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:02.422
WANNA UP OUR GAME BY BY DOING

01:46:02.489 --> 01:46:04.891
THE SO IT'S BOTH I'M A RECENT

01:46:04.958 --> 01:46:07.527
EXAMPLE WAS A IN THE SOUTHERN-

01:46:07.594 --> 01:46:09.730
SO YOU'RE A WATERSHED- ARE

01:46:09.796 --> 01:46:11.531
SOUTHERN REGIONAL OFFICE- IN

01:46:11.598 --> 01:46:15.268
OUR FRESNO OFFICE. RECEIVE SOME

01:46:15.335 --> 01:46:17.437
FEEDBACK FROM OF FOR EXAMPLE

01:46:17.504 --> 01:46:18.839
THE FRONT WATER DISTRICT THAT

01:46:18.905 --> 01:46:20.107
SOME OF THE DATA THAT THEY WERE

01:46:20.173 --> 01:46:22.642
RELYING ON UP IN THE SIERRA

01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:23.810
WATERSHED WAS NO LONGER COMING

01:46:23.877 --> 01:46:26.279
THROUGH. SO THAT INVOLVED- THE

01:46:26.346 --> 01:46:27.414
DEPARTMENT WORKING WITH THE

01:46:27.481 --> 01:46:30.050
LOCAL AGENCIES TO GO OUT TO

01:46:30.117 --> 01:46:31.952
THAT STATION AND THERE WAS SOME

02:24:13.911 --> 02:24:15.847
CAPACITY TO ENGAGE IN THAT

02:24:15.913 --> 02:24:17.648
SWEAR I DO APPRECIATE YOUR

02:24:17.715 --> 02:24:19.017
ENGAGEMENT THE ENVIRO

02:24:19.083 --> 02:24:21.252
ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY

02:24:21.319 --> 02:24:22.653
IN ADVOCATES BUT THEY'RE NOT

02:24:22.720 --> 02:24:24.522
NECESSARILY POSITIONED IN

02:24:24.589 --> 02:24:26.190
EVERYONE OF THESE COMMUNITIES

02:24:26.257 --> 02:24:28.426
EITHER SO I THINK THE CONCERN

02:24:28.493 --> 02:24:30.061
IS THAT THERE'S A POTENTIAL GAP

02:24:30.128 --> 02:24:32.363
BETWEEN. EVEN WELL INFORMED

02:24:32.430 --> 02:24:36.267
ADVOCATES ABILITY TO LIAISON

02:24:36.334 --> 02:24:36.667
WITH SOME OF THOSE

02:24:36.734 --> 02:24:39.070
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

02:24:39.137 --> 02:24:40.471

SOME OF THE TECHNIQUES YOU'LL

02:24:46.978 --> 02:24:49.347
USE TO VERIFY I GUESS OUR

02:24:49.414 --> 02:24:51.315
CONCERN IS THAT SOME OF THE

02:24:51.382 --> 02:24:54.318
PLANS WILL CHECK A BOX THING WE

02:24:54.385 --> 02:24:56.521
DID COMMUNITY OUT REACH. BUT

02:24:56.587 --> 02:24:58.456
HOW DO YOU GO BELOW THAT

02:24:58.523 --> 02:25:01.726
CHECKING THE BOX TO VERIFY. A

02:25:01.793 --> 02:25:03.561
REAL ENGAGEMENT WITH

02:25:03.628 --> 02:25:05.530
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO

02:25:05.596 --> 02:25:07.265
THE END OF MAKING SURE WE ARE

02:25:07.331 --> 02:25:08.833
DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO

02:25:08.900 --> 02:25:11.169
PROTECT SAFE CLEAN DRINKING

02:25:11.235 --> 02:25:12.070
WATER AS PART OF THE

02:25:12.136 --> 02:25:14.539
SUSTAINABILITY. YES A ONE WAY

02:25:14.605 --> 02:25:16.574
WE CAN ADDRESS IT IS THROUGH-

02:25:16.641 --> 02:25:18.109
SO WE WON'T THE DEPARTMENT WILL

02:25:18.176 --> 02:25:19.610
MAKE AN EVALUATION AND AS YOU

02:25:19.677 --> 02:25:21.379
KNOW WE HAVE A STATUTORY

02:25:21.446 --> 02:25:23.781
OBLIGATION TO COMPLETE THAT

02:25:23.848 --> 02:25:25.149

02:25:25.216 --> 02:25:28.152
RECEIVING. THE PLANS I'M IN IN

02:25:28.219 --> 02:25:30.521
THAT CONTEXT THE DEPARTMENT

02:25:30.588 --> 02:25:32.223
CAN- FIND AN INADEQUACY

02:25:32.290 --> 02:25:33.691
DETERMINATION AND THAT'S WHEN

02:25:33.758 --> 02:25:35.393
WE ENGAGE WITH THE BOARD- BUT

02:25:35.460 --> 02:25:37.428

PROVIDE FOR CORRECTIVE ACTIONS.

02:25:40.465 --> 02:25:43.000
AND SO YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE-

02:25:43.067 --> 02:25:44.635
YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME GROUND

02:25:44.702 --> 02:25:46.471

ACTIONS THAT- SENSUALLY- IN

02:26:19.036 --> 02:26:21.205
ABLE THE DEPARTMENT TO MAKE A

02:26:21.272 --> 02:26:22.940
DETERMINATION ON THE QUALITY OF

02:26:23.007 --> 02:26:24.509
THE INPUT AND THE QUALITY OF

FIRST OF ALL IT'S VERY HARD TO

02:35:46.170 --> 02:35:46.704

DEPARTMENT OR STATE WATER BOARD

02:38:56.293 --> 02:38:57.961
IN THE GSP REVIEW WE'RE GOING

02:38:58.028 --> 02:38:59.196
TO SEE A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT

02:38:59.263 --> 02:39:01.331
IMPACTS TO SAFE DRINKING WATER

02:39:01.398 --> 02:39:03.567
ACCESS. OUR THAT IS CAUSED BY

02:39:03.634 --> 02:39:04.735
THE LACK OF OUR REGION

02:39:04.801 --> 02:39:05.569
ENGAGEMENT THAT HAS BEEN

02:39:05.636 --> 02:39:07.437
OCCURRING THAT CENTER MONNING

02:39:07.504 --> 02:39:09.740
BROUGHT UP. BUT IF YOU ARE OUT

02:39:09.806 --> 02:39:11.541
REACHING ENGAGING THE RIGHT

02:39:11.608 --> 02:39:13.310
PEOPLE AND YOU'RE NOT LISTENING

02:39:13.377 --> 02:39:14.344
TO THEIR CONCERNS AND THEIR

02:39:14.411 --> 02:39:15.679
NEEDS YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE

02:39:15.746 --> 02:39:18.382
PLANS. THAT FAIL TO RECOGNIZE

02:39:18.448 --> 02:39:21.018
THE IN SERIOUS IMPACTS TO THOSE

02:39:21.084 --> 02:39:23.153
COMMUNITIES I ALSO ONE STATE

02:39:23.220 --> 02:39:25.622
THAT. ANALYSIS OF SEVEN GS

02:39:25.689 --> 02:39:26.757
PIECE DONE BY CLEAN MORE

02:39:26.823 --> 02:39:27.824
ADVOCATES HAVE SHOWN THAT OVER

02:39:27.891 --> 02:39:29.927
A HUNDRED THOUSAND. RESIDENTS

02:39:29.993 --> 02:39:31.929
WILL BE IMPACTED BY DEWATERING

02:39:31.995 --> 02:39:34.131
OF WELLS POTENTIALLY A HUNDRED

02:39:34.197 --> 02:39:35.866
THOUSAND THAT'S JUST SEVEN GS.

02:39:35.933 --> 02:39:38.068
GSA'S AND THAT'S NOT INCLUDING

02:39:38.135 --> 02:39:39.736
WATER QUALITY IMPACTS OUTSIDE

02:39:39.803 --> 02:39:40.304
INCLUDING THOSE WERE GONNA

02:39:40.370 --> 02:39:41.571
IMPACTED BY INCREASING

02:39:41.638 --> 02:39:43.774
CONCENTRATIONS OF CONTAMINANTS.

02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:44.775
THIS IS NOT ADDRESSED IN THE

02:39:44.841 --> 02:39:46.343
GSP REVIEW PROCESS THE BURDENS

02:39:46.410 --> 02:39:47.945
CAN BE BORNE BY THE STATE

02:39:48.011 --> 02:39:48.478
THROUGH THE STATE FOR THE

02:39:48.545 --> 02:39:49.780
DRINKING WATER FUND. THE FUN

02:39:49.846 --> 02:39:51.281
WASN'T DESIGNED TO ADDRESS POOR

02:39:51.348 --> 02:39:55.852
SIGNAL IMPLEMENTATION AND SO

02:39:55.919 --> 02:39:56.420
THERE FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE

02:39:56.486 --> 02:39:57.020
FUND IS THREATENED. THE REASON

02:39:57.087 --> 02:39:58.355
IS COMMITTED TO BEING HELPFUL

02:39:58.422 --> 02:39:58.989
THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AND WE

02:39:59.056 --> 02:40:00.457
WILL BE SUBMITTING. SEVERAL G.

02:40:00.524 --> 02:40:02.793
S. P. THE- LETTERS DETAILING

02:40:02.859 --> 02:40:03.894
THE IMPACTS TO QUANTITY AND

02:40:03.961 --> 02:40:05.729
QUALITY. BUT WE HAVE LIMITED

02:40:05.796 --> 02:40:07.164
CAPACITY AND WE CAN'T BE

02:40:07.230 --> 02:40:08.665
EVERYWHERE SO THERE'S A

02:40:08.732 --> 02:40:09.900
QUESTION OF WHAT GOES ON IN

02:40:09.967 --> 02:40:12.135
THIS YEAR'S PEAS WERE. THE A B.

02:40:12.202 --> 02:40:13.170
C. OR OUR ALLIES ARE NOT

02:40:13.236 --> 02:40:15.305
WORKING. SO IN CLOSING I JUST

02:40:15.372 --> 02:40:17.274
WANT TO STATE THAT. DURING THE

02:40:17.341 --> 02:40:18.542
REVIEW BY THE DEPARTMENT IN THE

02:40:18.608 --> 02:40:19.509
STATE WATER BOARD THE QUESTION

02:40:19.576 --> 02:40:20.711
NEEDS TO BE ASKED HOW IS THIS

02:40:20.777 --> 02:40:22.479
PLAN IMPACTING SAFE DRINKING

02:40:22.546 --> 02:40:24.181
WATER. IF THAT QUESTION IS AN

02:40:24.247 --> 02:40:25.449
ASKED AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS

02:40:25.515 --> 02:40:27.584
ARE NOT MANDATED WE'RE

02:40:27.651 --> 02:40:30.253
THREATENING. THE HOW FAR WE'VE

02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:31.555
COME TO CREATING A SAFE

02:40:31.621 --> 02:40:35.125
DRINKING WATER FUTURE THANK YOU.

02:40:35.192 --> 02:40:36.860
THANK YOU NEXT. BUT AFTERNOON

02:40:36.927 --> 02:40:38.061

ACCOUNTABILITY. AND I'D START

02:40:42.866 --> 02:40:44.935
BY SIMILARLY THINKING- THE

02:40:45.002 --> 02:40:47.237
DIRECTOR AS WELL AS THE W. OUR

02:40:47.304 --> 02:40:48.638
STAFF FOR SOME REALLY GOOD

02:40:48.705 --> 02:40:51.208
MEETINGS WE'VE HAD- AS WELL AS

02:40:51.274 --> 02:40:52.209
THE COMMENTS THAT I'VE HEARD

02:40:52.275 --> 02:40:54.311
TODAY. I'M CONFIDENT THAT THE

02:40:54.378 --> 02:40:55.579
W. OURS TAKING DRINKING WATER

02:40:55.645 --> 02:40:58.815
IMPACTS- RELATED TO CIGNA

02:40:58.882 --> 02:41:01.418
SERIOUSLY. RIGHT WE DO HAVE A

02:41:01.485 --> 02:41:03.420
LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT SIGMUND

02:41:03.487 --> 02:41:04.721
PULLMAN TATIAN AND THEY STEM

02:41:04.788 --> 02:41:07.524
FROM A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST-

02:41:07.591 --> 02:41:09.393
WE WORK WITH COMMUNITIES THAT.

02:41:09.459 --> 02:41:11.061
WERE THE FIRST TO SEE DR WELLS

02:41:11.128 --> 02:41:12.262
IN THE LAST DROUGHT THEY WERE

02:41:12.329 --> 02:41:13.530
THE FIRST TO SEE DRY AFTER AYE

02:41:13.597 --> 02:41:15.732
WELLS OR THEY WILL BE THE FIRST

02:41:15.799 --> 02:41:16.333
TO SEE DR WELLS IN THE NEXT

02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:18.168
DROUGHT. AND THEY'VE CONTINUED

02:41:18.235 --> 02:41:19.736
TO SEE WELL AS GOOD DRIVE EVEN

02:41:19.803 --> 02:41:22.239
AFTER THE DROUGHT ENDED SO THEY

02:41:22.305 --> 02:41:24.074
DESERVE THESE ARE CONTINUING

02:41:24.141 --> 02:41:25.776
IMPACTS. AND UNFORTUNATELY THE

02:41:25.842 --> 02:41:26.777
ROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY

02:41:26.843 --> 02:41:28.412
PLANS THAT WE'VE ENGAGED ON AND

02:41:28.478 --> 02:41:30.647
SEEN SO FAR THOSE ARE ABOUT

02:41:30.714 --> 02:41:32.682
THIRTEEN PLANS I BELIEVE- ARE

02:41:32.749 --> 02:41:33.950
REALLY AN ADEQUATE THERE'S ONE

02:41:34.017 --> 02:41:35.185
PLAN IN PARTICULAR THAT WOULD

02:41:35.252 --> 02:41:37.387
ALLOW ABOUT 86% A WELLS TO GO

02:41:37.454 --> 02:41:39.656
DRIVE DOMESTIC WELLS- AND WE

02:41:39.723 --> 02:41:40.590
DON'T WE BROUGHT THAT

02:41:40.657 --> 02:41:41.892
INFORMATION TO THE GSP THEY

02:41:41.958 --> 02:41:42.993
CAME BACK AND SAID WELL NO

02:41:43.060 --> 02:41:44.461
THAT'S- THAT'S NOT RIGHT IT'S

02:41:44.528 --> 02:41:46.363
ONLY ABOUT 50% WELLS. AND

02:41:46.430 --> 02:41:47.731
THAT'S THAT'S A COMPLETELY

02:41:47.798 --> 02:41:49.733
INADEQUATE RESPONSE AND IT'S

02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:50.934
UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE'RE SEEING

02:41:51.001 --> 02:41:53.136
A LOT OF YES PLEASE. SO WHAT

02:41:53.203 --> 02:41:54.604
WE'RE ASKING FOR TODAY- WE

02:41:54.671 --> 02:41:56.606
SUPPORT FUNDING FOR D. W. ARE

02:41:56.673 --> 02:41:57.340
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

02:41:57.407 --> 02:41:59.543
IMPLEMENTING THEIR ABLE TO

02:41:59.609 --> 02:42:02.612
REVIEW PLANS ADEQUATELY- TO

02:42:02.679 --> 02:42:04.714
ADD. REVIEW TO ANALYZE WHAT THE

02:42:04.781 --> 02:42:06.416
DRINKING WATER IMPACTS WILL BE

02:42:06.483 --> 02:42:08.885
RELATED TO THE ESPYS ESPECIALLY

02:42:08.952 --> 02:42:11.788
THE ONES THAT. DON'T HAVE NGOS

02:42:11.855 --> 02:42:15.325
DOING ANALYSIS- IN ADDITION AND

02:42:15.392 --> 02:42:16.760
THEY OUTRAGE ENGAGEMENT ISSUE

02:42:16.827 --> 02:42:18.728
PROPOSITION ONE PROVIDED SOME

02:42:18.795 --> 02:42:19.830
FUNDING FOR OUR REGION

02:42:19.896 --> 02:42:21.665
ENGAGEMENT. UNFORTUNATELY UNDER

02:42:21.731 --> 02:42:22.799
OUR UNDERSTANDING IS

02:42:22.866 --> 02:42:24.167
PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT DOES

02:42:24.234 --> 02:42:25.869
NOT PROVIDE CONTINUED FUNDING

02:42:25.936 --> 02:42:26.670
AND THAT'S NOT AN ELIGIBLE

02:42:26.736 --> 02:42:28.305
EXPENSE INTERPRET SIXTY EIGHT.

02:42:28.371 --> 02:42:29.739
SO THAT'S A GAP THAT NEEDS TO

02:42:29.806 --> 02:42:31.241
BE FILLED. AND THEN AS WE

02:42:31.308 --> 02:42:32.876
IMPLEMENT THE PROJECTS NEED TO

02:42:32.943 --> 02:42:34.678
BE IMPLEMENTED NEAR-

02:42:34.744 --> 02:42:35.846
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND

02:42:35.912 --> 02:42:37.314
PROVIDE DIRECT BENEFITS TO

02:42:37.380 --> 02:42:38.949
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. I

02:42:39.015 --> 02:42:41.651
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TUNING

02:42:41.718 --> 02:42:42.252
TO WORK WITH YOU HAVE YOU ARE

CLEAN WATER ACTION THANK YOU

02:42:47.591 --> 02:42:48.658
EVERYONE FOR COMMENTS TODAY

02:42:48.725 --> 02:42:50.660
THEY WERE ALL SUPER HELPFUL A

02:42:50.727 --> 02:42:52.529
MY ORGANIZATION IS TEAMED WITH

02:42:52.596 --> 02:42:54.331
SEVERAL OTHER GROUPS AND THE

02:42:54.397 --> 02:42:55.699
WATER FOUNDATION TO REVIEW AS

02:42:55.765 --> 02:42:57.067
MANY PLANTS AS WE COULD WE

02:42:57.134 --> 02:42:58.168
REALLY LIMITED THE SCOPE OF THE

02:42:58.235 --> 02:43:00.237
REVIEW AND WE'RE ABLE TO WORK

02:43:00.303 --> 02:43:01.938
YOU THIRTY ONE OF THE FORTY

02:43:02.005 --> 02:43:03.306
FIVE PLANS WHICH JUST GOES TO

02:43:03.373 --> 02:43:03.907
SHOW WHAT THE RESOURCE NEEDS

02:43:03.974 --> 02:43:06.343
ARE AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT

02:43:06.409 --> 02:43:07.811
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IS NOT.

02:43:07.878 --> 02:43:09.679
FAIR NOT TO THE TOP OF THE LIST

02:43:09.746 --> 02:43:11.414
ABOUT EIGHT OTHER PLANS DON'T

02:43:11.481 --> 02:43:12.015
EVEN HAVE A STAKEHOLDER

02:43:12.082 --> 02:43:14.351
ENGAGEMENT PLAN- THE ONES THAT

02:43:14.417 --> 02:43:16.586
DO DON'T ACTUALLY GO TO THAT

02:43:16.653 --> 02:43:17.787
THEY MIGHT IDENTIFY WHERE THOSE

02:43:17.854 --> 02:43:19.689
COMMUNITIES ARE BUT THEY DON'T

02:43:19.756 --> 02:43:21.358
LIKE LOCATE NECESSARILY LOCATE

02:43:21.424 --> 02:43:22.459
MONITORING WELLS NEAR THOSE

02:43:22.526 --> 02:43:23.894
COMMUNITIES SECTION MEASURE IF

02:43:23.960 --> 02:43:25.695
THEY'RE GONNA LOSE THEIR WATER

02:43:25.762 --> 02:43:27.364
THEY DON'T LOOK AT THE IMPACTS

02:43:27.430 --> 02:43:29.299
OF THEIR OPERATIONS ON THOSE

02:43:29.366 --> 02:43:31.134
WATER SUPPLY AND SO I A

02:43:31.201 --> 02:43:33.303
SUGGESTED THEY DON'T MEET THE-

02:43:33.370 --> 02:43:34.738
REQUIREMENT TO CONSIDER THE

02:43:34.804 --> 02:43:35.839
INTERESTS DISADVANTAGED

02:43:35.906 --> 02:43:37.874
COMMUNITIES AND THAT GOES BACK

02:43:37.941 --> 02:43:39.609
TO THE GOVERNANCE ISSUE THE

02:43:39.676 --> 02:43:43.146
STRUCTURE OF THE GROUNDWATER

02:43:43.213 --> 02:43:44.814
THE STORE IS THAT ARE IN POWER

02:43:44.881 --> 02:43:47.083
NOW AND SO THEY DON'T HAVE ANY

02:43:47.150 --> 02:43:48.618
INCENTIVE TO REACH OUT TO THOSE

02:43:48.685 --> 02:43:50.287
WHO ARE NOT IN POWER AND WE'RE

02:43:50.353 --> 02:43:52.322
SEEING THAT ON THE GROUND IN

02:43:52.389 --> 02:43:54.157
WHAT'S COMING OUT OF THE PLANTS

02:43:54.224 --> 02:43:56.893
AND HOW THEIR RESPONDING TO THE

02:43:56.960 --> 02:43:58.728
NEEDS OF COMMUNITIES ARE GOING

02:43:58.795 --> 02:44:00.564
TO LOSE THEIR WATER SUPPLY MOST

02:44:00.630 --> 02:44:01.398
OF THE PLANS DON'T HAVE

02:44:01.464 --> 02:44:03.800
CONCRETE- PLANS FOR HOW THEY'RE

02:44:03.867 --> 02:44:05.035
EITHER GOING TO HANDLE DEMAND

02:44:05.101 --> 02:44:10.006
MANAGEMENT OR NEW SUPPLY. OVER

02:44:10.073 --> 02:44:10.574
THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF THE

02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:11.508
PLAN. AND SO WHAT I'M WHAT I'M

02:44:11.575 --> 02:44:13.810
LOOKING AT IS A STEEP DECLINE.

02:44:13.877 --> 02:44:15.245
IN WATER LIKE A CONTINUE TO

02:44:15.312 --> 02:44:16.846
DECLINE IN WATER LEVELS FOR

02:44:16.913 --> 02:44:18.181
THIS THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE

02:44:18.248 --> 02:44:19.616
UNTIL SOMEONE COMES IN AND SAY

02:44:19.683 --> 02:44:20.550
HEY YOU REALLY HAVE TO BE

02:44:20.617 --> 02:44:22.619
SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. AND SO WE

02:44:22.686 --> 02:44:24.354
HOPE WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR

02:44:24.421 --> 02:44:26.456
ATTENTION TO THIS. AND WE THINK

02:44:26.523 --> 02:44:28.792
THAT- YOU SHOULD CONTINUE TO

02:44:28.858 --> 02:44:30.160
PAY ATTENTION MOVING FORWARD

02:44:30.227 --> 02:44:32.562
THANK YOU. YOUR NEXT. WHAT ARE

02:44:32.629 --> 02:44:33.163
WE DONE WITHOUT AMONG

02:44:33.230 --> 02:44:35.031
CALIFORNIA- I WENT ONLINE

02:44:35.098 --> 02:44:37.434
MYSELF- AND MY REALIZATIONS

02:44:37.500 --> 02:44:39.035
WITH THE COMMENTS. THOSE MADE

02:44:39.102 --> 02:44:41.638
BY A- THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS IN

02:44:41.705 --> 02:44:42.539
ADDITION WE WERE- IN ADDITION

02:44:42.606 --> 02:44:44.908
TO THAT- TO A JENNIFER CLEAR IT

02:44:44.975 --> 02:44:46.610
WAS JUST SAYING- WE TO WERE

02:44:46.676 --> 02:44:48.144
PART OF THAT REVIEW TEAM IN

02:44:48.211 --> 02:44:50.213
LOOKING AT THESE THIRTY ONE-

02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:52.115
PLANS. WHEN I THINGS THAT- HAS

02:44:52.182 --> 02:44:54.150
CONSTANTLY COME UP OVER AND

02:44:54.217 --> 02:44:57.120
OVER IS THAT THERE IS NO OR A

02:44:57.187 --> 02:44:58.121
REAL CONSIDERATION TO THE

02:44:58.188 --> 02:45:05.695
IMPACTS TO THE- HE- ASSUMES. OF.

02:45:05.762 --> 02:45:06.196
SOME OF THESE PLANS. ARE
