BILL MOVES THROUGH THE SENATE.

01:10:30.192 --> 01:10:32.194
THE PROBLEMS WITH THE BILL

INDUSTRIES IN CALIFORNIA BUT

01:10:36.832 --> 01:10:39.168
INSTEAD WHAT'S BEEN DONE. IS A

01:10:39.234 --> 01:10:40.836
LAUNDRY LIST OF EXEMPTIONS HAS

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:42.605

THE COULDN'T ART. AND MY

01:10:49.244 --> 01:10:49.878
BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THAT

01:10:49.945 --> 01:10:52.715
APPROACH. IS THAT IT STIFLES

01:10:52.781 --> 01:10:54.016
INNOVATION AN ENTREPRENEURIAL

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:55.618
ISM HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE

01:10:55.684 --> 01:10:58.520

TESTIFIED BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY I

01:11:11.133 --> 01:11:13.435
TOLD YOU THE STORY OF HOW I

01:11:13.502 --> 01:11:14.036
STARTED MY BUSINESS OUT OF MY

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:16.972
DORM ROOM THIRTY YEARS AGO. THE

01:11:17.039 --> 01:11:17.806
BILL WOULD HAVE MADE IT

01:11:17.873 --> 01:11:19.241
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO DO THAT

01:11:19.308 --> 01:11:20.275
BECAUSE OF THE SO CALLED B.

01:11:20.342 --> 01:11:22.244
PILLAR. IN THE DYNAMICS TEST

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:23.612

01:11:26.148 --> 01:11:27.416
IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF

BUSINESS FOR THE BUSINESS THAT

01:11:29.385 --> 01:11:29.952
YOU'RE OPERATING AT ALL HAS TO

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:32.755
BE EMPLOYEES. I WAS A KID IN MY

01:11:32.821 --> 01:11:34.790
DORM ROOM I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:35.924
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE OUR

POSTING REQUIREMENTS ARE WAGE

01:11:39.261 --> 01:11:41.030
ORDERS OR ANY OF THAT. AND

01:11:41.096 --> 01:11:42.164
FRANKLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO

01:11:42.231 --> 01:11:43.866
DAUNTING FOR ME TO TRY AND

01:11:43.932 --> 01:11:45.167
START A BUSINESS AND THINK

01:11:45.234 --> 01:11:46.602
ABOUT COMPLYING. WITH THOSE

01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:49.505
REQUIREMENTS. SO THAT BUSINESS

01:11:49.571 --> 01:11:50.072
WOULD HAVE NOT BEEN STARTED

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:51.006
HERE WE HAVE BEEN STARTED

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:53.075
ELSEWHERE. AND THE HUNDREDS OF

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.576
JOBS THAT MY BUSINESS IS

01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:55.744
CREATED IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:57.946
LAST THIRTY YEARS. WOULD NOT BE

01:11:58.013 --> 01:11:58.514
IN CALIFORNIA THEY WOULD BE

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:01.116
ELSEWHERE. WHAT HAPPENED TO US.

01:12:01.183 --> 01:12:03.986
CALIFORNIA USED TO BE. A PLACE

01:12:04.053 --> 01:12:04.520
WHERE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:07.456
SPIRIT. WAS NURTURED. WE'VE HAD

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:08.991
INCREDIBLE SUCCESS AND HAVING

01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:10.492
COMPANIES START HERE COMPANIES

01:12:10.559 --> 01:12:12.261
LIKE APPLE AND GOOGLE AND

01:12:12.327 --> 01:12:16.031
FACEBOOK AND MY COMPANY. I FEAR

01:12:16.098 --> 01:12:17.466
THAT IF THIS IS THE THINKING OF

01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:19.401
THE LEGISLATURE AND THIS IS THE

01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:21.770
THINKING OF OUR GOVERNOR I

01:12:21.837 --> 01:12:22.371
REALLY FEAR FOR THE FUTURE OF

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:25.074
OUR STATE. AND ONE THING THAT I

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:26.608
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT IN

01:12:26.675 --> 01:12:28.677
CLOSING HERE IS THE FACT THAT.

01:12:28.744 --> 01:12:30.112
I'M TIRED OF HEARING PEOPLE

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:32.715
SAY. THAT THIS BILL EMPOWERS

01:12:32.781 --> 01:12:33.716
WORKERS THIS BILL DOES NOT

01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:35.184
EMPOWER WORKERS THIS BILL

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:37.286
DISENFRANCHISES WORKERS IT

01:12:37.352 --> 01:12:38.921
DISEMPOWERED AS WORKERS AND IF

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:39.855
YOU WANT PROOF OF THAT. YOU

01:12:39.922 --> 01:12:41.990
NEED LOOK NOFURTHER. THAN THE

01:12:42.057 --> 01:12:42.758
INDUSTRIES THAT ARE

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:44.760
SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED FROM THIS

01:12:44.827 --> 01:12:46.295
BILL WHICH ARE THE

01:12:46.361 --> 01:12:47.196
TRANSPORTATION NETWORK

01:12:47.262 --> 01:12:48.831
COMPANIES LIKE UBER AND LEFT

01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:50.199
RIGHT NOW IF YOU'RE A DRIVER

01:12:50.265 --> 01:12:51.467
FOR THOSE TNC IS YOU GET TO

01:12:51.533 --> 01:12:53.402
DECIDE ON YOUR OWN. WHERE YOU

01:12:53.469 --> 01:12:54.536
POSITION YOUR VEHICLE AND WHEN

01:12:54.603 --> 01:12:56.605
YOU DRIVE AND THAT WILL BECOME

01:12:56.672 --> 01:12:58.006
IMPOSSIBLE AFTER THIS BILL

01:12:58.073 --> 01:12:59.708
BECOMES LAW. AND I'VE HAD

01:12:59.775 --> 01:13:00.542
PEOPLE SAY WELL NO THE BILL

01:13:00.609 --> 01:13:01.610
DOESN'T DISALLOW IT WILL YES IT

01:13:01.677 --> 01:13:03.112
DOES ACTUALLY IF YOU READ IT IT

01:13:03.178 --> 01:13:04.480
SAYS THAT THOSE DRIVERS HAVE TO

01:13:04.546 --> 01:13:05.981
BE EMPLOYEES WHICH MEANS THEY

01:13:06.048 --> 01:13:07.216
HAVE TO BE PAID MINIMUM WAGE

01:13:07.282 --> 01:13:08.584
WHICH MEANS THAT. IF YOU'RE

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:10.753
OVER LEFT YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:12.955
TO EXERCISE CONTROL OVER WE'RE

01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:14.923
VEHICLE IS LOCATED AND WHEN A

01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:16.391
DRIVER DRIVES YOU'RE NOT GONNA

01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:18.227
BE ABLE TO ALLOW THE DRIVER. TO

01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:19.928
POSITION A VEHICLE IN A BAD

01:13:19.995 --> 01:13:21.130
SECTION OF TOWN AND DRIVE A TWO

01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:23.365
O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING BECAUSE

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:24.099
THEY ARE UNLIKELY TO MAKE UP

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:25.267
THAT MINIMUM WAGE THAT YOU'RE

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:25.834
GONNA BE ABLE TO IF YOU'RE

01:13:25.901 --> 01:13:27.703
GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO PAY. SO

01:13:27.770 --> 01:13:28.837
I FEAR THAT THIS IS REALLY

01:13:28.904 --> 01:13:32.107
GOING TO DO DAMAGE TO OUR

01:13:32.174 --> 01:13:32.674
ECONOMY IN CALIFORNIA I URGE

01:13:32.741 --> 01:13:37.012

OBLIGATION AS THE CHAIR OF BAG

01:13:44.219 --> 01:13:45.087
TO BE ABLE TO GET UP AND SAY

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:47.156
THIS ISSUE THAT WE- CONTINUE TO

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:48.724
TALK ABOUT. IS TRUCKERS THAT

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:49.958
ARE HAULING THINGS FOR

01:13:50.025 --> 01:13:50.959
AGRICULTURE UP AND DOWN THE

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:52.594
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT REMAINS

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:54.062
AN ISSUE. ONE OF MY COLLEAGUE

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:55.597
SAID WE WILL BE DEALING WITH

01:13:55.664 --> 01:13:57.399
THIS. ISSUE FOR THE NEXT

01:13:57.466 --> 01:13:58.600
PROBABLY THE REST OF OUR TIME

01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:00.002
IN THIS HOUSE WHICH I THINK IS

01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:01.737
PROBABLY TRUE. AS THE YEARS

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:03.138

CONTINUE TO REVISIT THIS ISSUE.

01:14:06.775 --> 01:14:08.043
SO I RISE ONLY TO RAISE A

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:08.644
CONCERN THAT I THINK THEY'RE

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:10.679
STILL. I APPRECIATE ALL THE

01:14:10.746 --> 01:14:13.148
WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE I THINK

01:14:13.215 --> 01:14:13.715
THERE'S MORE NEAT WORK THAT

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:15.751
NEEDS TO BE DONE. GOING FORWARD.

TODAY AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER

01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:25.761
OPPOSED TO AB FIVE. IN THE WAKE

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:26.895
OF THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION

01:14:26.962 --> 01:14:28.897
IN THE DYNAMICS CASE. IT WAS

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:30.833
CLEAR WE HAD TO DO SOMETHING

01:14:30.899 --> 01:14:33.068
WITHOUT ACTION THE SUPREME.

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:34.503
COURT'S DECISION WOULD WRECK

01:14:34.570 --> 01:14:36.271
OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. BUT THIS

01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:38.607
BILL ISN'T THE ANSWER. RATHER

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:40.142
THAN FIXING THE WAVE WE DEFINE

01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:41.643
AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR TO

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:44.046
STOP BAD ACTORS AB FIVE MAKES A

01:14:44.112 --> 01:14:46.481
BAD LAW WITH A- LITTLE LESS BAD

01:14:46.548 --> 01:14:48.250
AND CARVE OUTS FOR THE TRADE

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:50.786
GROUPS. WITH THE BEST LOBBYIST.

01:14:50.853 --> 01:14:52.254
WHAT ABOUT THE WORKERS WHO

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:54.723
DON'T HAVE THOSE LOBBYIST. I

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:56.458
WAS FORTUNATE WHEN I STARTED MY

01:14:56.525 --> 01:14:58.660
BUSINESS. BY HARD WORK AND IT'S

01:14:58.727 --> 01:15:00.095
CERTAINLY HARD ENOUGH

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:02.097
ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA TO

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:03.465
START A BUSINESS. AND MAKE IT

01:15:03.532 --> 01:15:06.235
SUCCESSFUL. AND YES. I HIRED

01:15:06.301 --> 01:15:08.570
FOLKS. MANY OF THOSE WERE

01:15:08.637 --> 01:15:11.173
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. ALMOST

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.442
ALL SECOND CHANCE THERE'S- MANY

01:15:13.508 --> 01:15:15.677
PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED.

01:15:15.744 --> 01:15:16.945
SEASONAL AND SHORT TERM

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:19.848
EMPLOYMENT ALLOW FLEXIBILITY IS

01:15:19.915 --> 01:15:23.085
FOR THESE WORKERS AND OTHERS.

01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:24.052
TO PURSUE EDUCATION WHILE

01:15:24.119 --> 01:15:24.653
GAINING NEEDED EXPERIENCE IN

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.655
THE WORK FORCE. FOR MANY

01:15:26.722 --> 01:15:28.056
BUSINESSES THAT WON'T BE

01:15:28.123 --> 01:15:30.626
POSSIBLE UNDER THIS DYNAMIX

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:33.061
RULING. SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE

01:15:33.128 --> 01:15:35.731
CALLED US ABOUT THEIR TYPES OF

01:15:35.797 --> 01:15:37.866
JOBS ARE THEY EXEMPTED ARE THEY

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:40.002
NOT THEY WON AN EXEMPTION LIKE

01:15:40.068 --> 01:15:41.403
EVEN THIS MORNING INTERPRETERS

FROM ESCONDIDO CALL WANTING AN

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:47.509
AMENDMENT TO ADD THEM IN. SO IF

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:49.344

IT'S BASICALLY LIKE A SWISS

01:15:55.083 --> 01:15:57.686
CHEESE WITH A LOT OF HOLES IN

01:15:57.753 --> 01:15:58.320
IT. AT SOME POINT IT'S JUST NOT

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:00.322
A GOOD BILL. GET WORKERS WILL

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:02.524
LOSE THE FLEXIBILITY TO WORK

01:16:02.591 --> 01:16:04.493
WHEN AND WHERE THEY WANT IT'S

01:16:04.559 --> 01:16:05.694
ABOUT HOW THEY WANT TO RUN

01:16:05.761 --> 01:16:07.663
THEIR LIVES MANY WILL SEE THEIR

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:10.065
WORK OPPORTUNITIES ELIMINATED.

01:16:10.132 --> 01:16:11.833
THE IMPACT OF THE DYNAMICS

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:13.435
DECISION WILL BE TRAGIC AND

01:16:13.502 --> 01:16:16.038
SEVERE FOR WORKERS WHO RELY ON

01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:17.839
CONTRACTING TO MAKE ENDS MEET

01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:19.274
OR BUILD THE BUSINESS OF THEIR

WORK FOR A COMPANY THAT WAS

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:18.867
OWNED BY BAYER CORPORATION. AND

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:19.735
THEY MADE AN INDEPENDENT COP

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:21.470
ACTOR THEY MADE ME AN

01:17:21.536 --> 01:17:23.472
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. BECAUSE

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:24.206
THEY DIDN'T WANT HAVE TO PAY

01:17:24.272 --> 01:17:26.808
THE BENEFITS OF WHAT THEY WOULD

01:17:26.875 --> 01:17:29.011
PLAY A NORMAN CHLOE HOWEVER. IF

01:17:29.077 --> 01:17:34.216
I WAS AN EMPLOYEE I WOULD HAVE

01:17:34.282 --> 01:17:34.916
BEEN ABLE TO HAVE HEALTH

01:17:34.983 --> 01:17:35.951
INSURANCE WHICH I DIDN'T HAVE A

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:36.752
WHOLE TIME I DON'T HAVE ANY

01:17:36.818 --> 01:17:38.520
HEALTH INSURANCE IT WOULD MEAN

01:17:38.587 --> 01:17:39.588
A LOT MORE BENEFITS THAT I

01:17:39.654 --> 01:17:41.223
WOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO BEEN

01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:43.592
AFFORDED HAD I NOT BEEN DEEMED

01:17:43.658 --> 01:17:44.393
AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR BUT

01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:47.129
MY WORK LOAD WAS SO RIGOROUS

01:17:47.195 --> 01:17:48.196
THAT THERE WAS NO WAY I COULD

01:17:48.263 --> 01:17:48.663
HAVE BEEN INDEPENDENT

01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:50.165
CONTRACTOR WAS NO WAY I WASN'T

01:17:50.232 --> 01:17:51.266
ESTABLISHED BUSINESS THERE WAS

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:52.801
NO WAY THAT I'M COULD HAVE HAD

01:17:52.868 --> 01:17:53.835
ENOUGH TIME TO TAKE ON ANY

01:17:53.902 --> 01:17:55.871
OTHER CLIENTS THEY WERE MY ONLY

01:17:55.937 --> 01:17:56.838
CLIENT THAT WAS ALL THE

01:17:56.905 --> 01:17:58.640
WORKLOAD. WAS TOO GREAT THE

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:00.509
SCHEDULE WAS TOO DEMANDING AND

01:18:00.575 --> 01:18:02.778
SO I WAS AN EMPLOYEE THAT WAS

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:03.779
CLASSIFIED AS AN INDEPENDENT

01:18:03.845 --> 01:18:05.280
CONTRACTOR AND I WAS TREATED AS

01:18:05.347 --> 01:18:07.282
SUCH EVEN THOUGH THE WORK I WAS

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:08.717
DOING WAS THE WORK OF AN

01:18:08.784 --> 01:18:11.053
EMPLOYEE THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

01:18:11.119 --> 01:18:12.454
CONVERSATION TO HAVE AND WHAT

IS FORCE US TO DO NOT JUST US

01:18:14.456 --> 01:18:15.657

FOR US THOUGH CONTINUE THIS

01:18:23.165 --> 01:18:24.733
CONVERSATION BECAUSE I CAN'T

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:27.469
SAY THAT OUR TRADITIONAL IDEA

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:28.303
OF WHAT WORK IS EMPLOYER

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:30.806

WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY I'M GOING

01:19:24.359 --> 01:19:25.827
TO SUPPORT IT TODAY BUT I DO

01:19:25.894 --> 01:19:27.329
HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT SOME

01:19:27.395 --> 01:19:28.263
OF THE BUSINESS TO BUSINESS

01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:31.533
RELATIONSHIPS SPECIFICALLY

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.767
AROUND HOSPITALS AND NURSING

01:19:32.834 --> 01:19:35.971
REGISTRIES SO. WHILE PARTS OF

01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:38.173
THIS MAY WORK REALLY WELL IN

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:40.642
LARGE URBAN AREAS WE RELY ON

01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:42.477
NURSING REGISTRIES IN SOME OF

01:19:42.544 --> 01:19:43.712
OUR RURAL AREAS TO HELP

01:19:43.778 --> 01:19:45.413
SUPPLEMENT NURSING STAFF IT'S

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.215
HARD TO GET NURSES TO SOME

01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:49.284
COMMUNITIES IT DOESN'T MATTER

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:50.752
WHAT YOU PAY PEOPLE SOMETIMES

01:19:50.819 --> 01:19:52.254
TO LIVE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.655
THEY SIMPLY MAY NOT WANT TO

01:19:53.722 --> 01:19:55.390
LIVE THERE AND SO I HAVE REAL

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:58.260
CONCERNS THAT THAT THIS PART OF

01:19:58.326 --> 01:20:02.030
THIS. MAY NEED TO BE LOOKED AT

01:20:02.097 --> 01:20:02.631

01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:03.131
TOGETHER WITH THEIR OWN

01:20:03.198 --> 01:20:04.266
SYNDICATE BUT I THINK THAT THIS

01:20:04.332 --> 01:20:06.001
COULD HAVE A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:07.169
TO ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:08.570
RURAL COMMUNITIES AROUND

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:10.205
HOSPITALS IF WE DON'T FIX THIS

01:20:10.272 --> 01:20:12.407
PART OF IT SO I WILL BE

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:14.476

SOME MUSICIANS ARE COVERED

01:29:24.992 --> 01:29:26.227

WOULD SAY THAT THOSE MUSICIANS

01:29:57.525 --> 01:29:58.626
PROBABLY FALL INTO A FEW

01:29:58.693 --> 01:29:59.994
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES BUT IF YOU

01:30:00.061 --> 01:30:01.295

THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:15.943
MUSICIANS ARE FINE ARTIST IF

01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:16.544

01:30:22.049 --> 01:30:23.918

WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

01:30:43.738 --> 01:30:45.206

01:32:04.619 --> 01:32:05.887
TROUBLING PROCESS THAT YOU'RE

CALLING THEM ONE THING WHEN

THEY'RE NOT. LET ME JUST SAY

01:32:24.372 --> 01:32:27.742
THIS. FUNDAMENTALLY WE HAVE AN

01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:34.548
OBLIGATION. TO PASSED JUST LAWS.

01:32:34.615 --> 01:32:37.451
PART OF JUST LAWMAKING IS TO BE

01:32:37.518 --> 01:32:40.688
VERY VERY CLEAR. THAT WE ARE

01:32:40.755 --> 01:32:43.057
NOT STEPPING OVER A VERY

01:32:43.124 --> 01:32:45.693
IMPORTANT LINE WHICH IS EQUAL

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:49.096
PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW. WE

01:32:49.163 --> 01:32:51.766
HAVE MANY IDENTICALLY PLACED

01:32:51.832 --> 01:32:57.405
PEOPLE. WHO ARE NOT EQUALLY

01:32:57.471 --> 01:33:04.245
PROTECTED IN THIS LAW. WE ARE.

01:33:04.312 --> 01:33:05.613
PLAYING A POLITICAL RUSSIAN

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:09.150
ROULETTE. WITH THEIR LIVES

01:33:09.216 --> 01:33:10.785
THEIR LIVELIHOOD. AND THEIR

01:33:10.851 --> 01:33:16.857
LABOR. BUT WE'RE ALSO DOING

01:33:16.924 --> 01:33:19.760
HERE IS SETTING UP A CATEGORY.

01:33:19.827 --> 01:33:21.696
THAT IS PROTECTED FROM THE

01:33:21.762 --> 01:33:27.969
COURTS. LEAVING. MILLIONS OF

01:33:28.035 --> 01:33:29.503
CALIFORNIANS I'M PROTECTED FROM

01:33:29.570 --> 01:33:33.441
THE COURT. AND WE'RE SUGGESTING

01:33:33.507 --> 01:33:39.547
THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS A SOLUTION.

01:33:39.613 --> 01:33:40.114
ALSO WE'RE WE'RE MAKING LAW

01:33:40.181 --> 01:33:44.151
HERE. THAT WE KEEP SAYING WELL

01:33:44.218 --> 01:33:45.720
WE'RE GOING TO VISIT THIS WILL

01:33:45.786 --> 01:33:48.155
VISIT IT NEXT YEAR THE YEAR

01:33:48.222 --> 01:33:49.957
AFTER THE YEAR AFTER. WE'RE

01:33:50.024 --> 01:33:55.429
BASICALLY. ON THE FLY. TRYING

01:33:55.496 --> 01:33:56.998
TO FIGURE OUT WHO WERE GOING TO

01:33:57.064 --> 01:33:59.467
PENALIZE AND WHO WE ARE GOING

01:33:59.533 --> 01:34:02.703
TO GIVE A SAFE HARBOR TO. THAT

01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:05.506
IS NOT OBJECTIVE Là MAKING IT

01:34:05.573 --> 01:34:09.010
IS NOT FAIR LAW MAKING. IT IS

01:34:09.076 --> 01:34:13.280
VERY MUCH SUBJECTIVE LAWMAKING

01:34:13.347 --> 01:34:15.716
WE'RE ON A SLIPPERY SLOPE HERE

01:34:15.783 --> 01:34:17.885
AND THAT'S WHY YOU ARE SEEING

01:34:17.952 --> 01:34:19.487
SO MUCH ANGST AND SO MUCH

01:34:19.553 --> 01:34:22.656
CONCERN ABOUT WHY IS MY

01:34:22.723 --> 01:34:24.792
BUSINESS MODEL IDENTICAL TO

01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:27.194
THEIR BUSINESS MODEL AND THEIR

01:34:27.261 --> 01:34:29.730
BUSINESS MODEL IS PROTECTED AND

01:34:29.797 --> 01:34:33.434
MINE IS NOT. I FEAR THAT APART

01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:37.138
FROM. PERHAPS MAKING SOME SAFE

01:34:37.204 --> 01:34:43.277
HARBORS FOR COURT ACTIVITY THE.

01:34:43.344 --> 01:34:46.313
APPROACH HERE CHOOSING WINNERS

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:47.248
AND LOSERS IN LIKE SITUATED

01:34:47.314 --> 01:34:50.384
CIRCUMSTANCES IS GOING TO OPEN

01:34:50.451 --> 01:34:51.752
IN MY JUDGMENT THE FLOODGATE.

01:34:51.819 --> 01:34:55.222
OF LITIGATION. AND I THOUGHT

01:34:55.289 --> 01:34:56.791
THAT'S WHAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO

01:34:56.857 --> 01:34:59.627
BE ABOUT TRYING TO REMEDY AND

01:34:59.693 --> 01:35:01.262
SO I APPRECIATE. THE

01:35:01.328 --> 01:35:04.698
CONVERSATION HERE. LET'S

01:35:04.765 --> 01:35:06.133
REMEMBER WE ARE TREATING LIKE

01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:11.672
PEOPLE. THEN ON LIKE WAYS YES

01:35:11.739 --> 01:35:12.840
THIS IS A YEAH I THINK THIS IS

01:35:12.907 --> 01:35:16.744
FUNDAMENTALLY OF LEGISLATING ON

01:35:16.811 --> 01:35:18.813
VERY VERY TRICKY TERRITORY

01:35:18.879 --> 01:35:22.450
HERE. AND LAST. YOU CONSIDER

01:35:22.516 --> 01:35:24.952
THAT I'M EXAGGERATING THERE ARE

01:35:25.019 --> 01:35:28.889
SEVERAL COURT CASES RIGHT NOW

01:35:28.956 --> 01:35:29.457
THAT ARE WINNING CHALLENGES

01:35:29.523 --> 01:35:33.561
AGAINST THIS BODY. FOR

01:35:33.627 --> 01:35:35.996
LEGISLATING AND CROSSING THE

01:35:36.063 --> 01:35:37.565
LINE OF EQUAL PROTECTION UNDER

01:35:37.631 --> 01:35:39.667
THE LAW AND SO I'M GOING TO BE

01:35:39.733 --> 01:35:41.135
OF NO VOTE AND I SUGGEST THAT

01:35:41.202 --> 01:35:44.171

TO BE DEFEATED AND IT NEEDS TO

01:35:50.845 --> 01:35:53.147
BE REWORKED SO THAT WE ARE FAIR

01:35:53.214 --> 01:35:54.115

01:35:54.181 --> 01:35:56.951

CLARIFICATION AS OTHER MEMBERS

WHAT HAPPENED IF IT DOES HAPPEN

01:38:13.587 --> 01:38:15.189
WILL HAPPEN FOR THE POLITICALLY

01:38:15.256 --> 01:38:18.726
POPULAR SPECIAL INTEREST MOSTLY

01:38:18.792 --> 01:38:19.360
DOMINATED BY COASTAL AND LA AND

01:38:19.426 --> 01:38:23.430
SAN FRANCISCO. CERTAINLY THOSE

01:38:23.497 --> 01:38:24.531

THE EXEMPTION. AND IF IN FACT.

01:38:32.072 --> 01:38:34.608
WE HAVE A THREE PART TEST THAT

01:38:34.675 --> 01:38:35.209
WORKS FOR THE ECONOMY WHY ARE

01:38:35.276 --> 01:38:37.511
WE DOING EXEMPTIONS AT ALL. WHY

01:38:37.578 --> 01:38:38.045
ARE WE REQUIRE WRITING THE

01:38:38.112 --> 01:38:40.881
THREE PART TEST. TO AN

01:38:40.948 --> 01:38:43.517
APPROPRIATE DEFINITION NOW THAT

01:38:43.584 --> 01:38:44.118
WORK MAY BE TOUGH AND I DON'T

01:38:44.184 --> 01:38:48.956
BEGRUDGE THE. DIFFICULTY IN THE

01:38:49.023 --> 01:38:50.291

KNOW THE AUTHOR OTHERS HAVE

01:38:50.924 --> 01:38:54.028
STRUGGLED. TO NAVIGATE BUT I

01:38:54.094 --> 01:38:58.165
DON'T THINK HERE IN THIS. THE

01:38:58.232 --> 01:39:00.734
BILL BEFORE US WE'VE SOLVE THE

01:39:00.801 --> 01:39:01.302

LITIGATION FOR AFFECTED

01:39:05.539 --> 01:39:06.073
INDUSTRIES RIGHT AWAY I THINK

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:08.108
THAT PROBABLY MAKES SENSE. BUT

01:39:08.175 --> 01:39:09.910
WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH WE

01:39:09.977 --> 01:39:10.978
HAVEN'T GONE FAR ENOUGH WE

01:39:11.045 --> 01:39:12.146
HAVEN'T COME UP WITH A SOLUTION

01:39:12.212 --> 01:39:13.714
FOR ALL AND WHAT WE HAVE IS AND

01:39:13.781 --> 01:39:15.516
I OWE YOU A PROMISE TO FIX

01:39:15.582 --> 01:39:17.551

WE'RE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF

01:39:25.259 --> 01:39:26.660
AGRICULTURE LATER. AND IT NEVER

01:39:26.727 --> 01:39:29.163
HAPPENS. SO I FIND MYSELF IN A

01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:33.067
POSITION TODAY. TO CAST NO

01:46:37.324 --> 01:46:39.526
THEY- IS THE PLACE WHERE

01:46:39.593 --> 01:46:41.161
WORKERS EITHER GIVE UP THEIR

01:46:41.228 --> 01:46:43.430
JOBS TO MACHINES OR HAVE THEIR

01:46:43.497 --> 01:46:43.997
WORK LIVES BROKEN INTO TINY

01:46:44.064 --> 01:46:47.501
PIECES. THE GIG ECONOMY IS

01:46:47.567 --> 01:46:50.036
BASED ON FUTURE RELATIONSHIPS

01:46:50.103 --> 01:46:52.773
BUT WITH OUTDATED AND FEUDAL

01:46:52.839 --> 01:46:55.175
WORK RELATIONSHIPS. THAT'S THE

01:46:55.242 --> 01:46:57.477
ONLY AFFORD A USE OF THE SPEECH.

01:46:57.544 --> 01:46:59.112
IT'S NO SECRET THAT THE SO

01:46:59.179 --> 01:47:00.380
CALLED RIGHT SHARE APP

01:47:00.447 --> 01:47:02.649
COMPANIES WANT TO PROVIDE RIDES

01:47:02.716 --> 01:47:04.985
WITH DRIVERLESS CARS. BUT WE

01:47:05.051 --> 01:47:06.453
CANNOT ALLOW THEM TO PAVE THE

01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:10.123
WAY TO THAT FUTURE BY CRUSHING

01:47:10.190 --> 01:47:10.690
THE DREAMS AND THE LIVES OF

01:47:10.757 --> 01:47:14.027
WORKERS. I ENVISION A FUTURE

01:47:14.094 --> 01:47:15.962
WHERE PEOPLE ARE ENTITLED TO

01:47:16.029 --> 01:47:19.032
DECENT JOBS AND HAVE HEALTHCARE.

01:47:19.099 --> 01:47:20.033
AND HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY

01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:22.369
FOR HOUSING AND WITH A DECENT

01:47:22.435 --> 01:47:23.770
ENVIRONMENT TO JOIN ON THEIR

01:47:23.837 --> 01:47:26.406
TIME OFF. THE FLEXIBILITY TO

01:47:26.473 --> 01:47:28.375
WORK THREE JOBS TO MAKE A

01:47:28.441 --> 01:47:31.812
LIVING IS NOT FREEDOM. I ASK

YOU AND I DO WANT TO ADDRESS A

01:47:39.186 --> 01:47:43.456
FEW COMMENTS MADE ON THIS FLOOR.

01:47:43.523 --> 01:47:44.658
I THINK IT'S HIGHLY OFFENSIVE.

01:47:44.724 --> 01:47:46.459
TO SUGGEST. THAT WE NEED TO

01:47:46.526 --> 01:47:52.399
START OVER. CONTRA ARE ARE A

01:47:52.465 --> 01:47:53.433
RULES ABOUT INDEPENDENT

01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:55.302
CONTRACTORS WERE CREATED IN THE

01:47:55.368 --> 01:47:57.804
COURTS TO TEST CALLED CARRILLO.

01:47:57.871 --> 01:47:59.072

CLASSIFICATION LAWSUITS THAT

01:48:03.009 --> 01:48:05.412
CLEARLY HAD BAD EMPLOYERS

01:48:05.478 --> 01:48:08.782
TRYING TO CIRCUMVENT THE LAW.

01:48:08.849 --> 01:48:09.950
SEVEN SUPREME COURT JUSTICES

01:48:10.016 --> 01:48:11.718
FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS

01:48:11.785 --> 01:48:13.753
UNANIMOUSLY UNANIMOUSLY

01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:15.922
CONSIDERED THIS AND SAID WE

01:48:15.989 --> 01:48:18.091
NEED A CLEAR TEST. AND THAT'S

01:48:18.158 --> 01:48:20.861
HOW WE GOT DYNAMAX. I HAVE BEEN

01:48:20.927 --> 01:48:25.332
WORKING ON THIS ISSUE. SINCE A

01:48:25.398 --> 01:48:25.899
YEAR AGO APRIL WHEN DYNAMAX

01:48:25.966 --> 01:48:29.703
CAME OUT. THINKING THROUGH

01:48:29.769 --> 01:48:32.939
EVERY SINGLE TYPE OF WORK

01:48:33.006 --> 01:48:34.741
THINKING THRILL OF HOW WE COULD

01:48:34.808 --> 01:48:36.309
HAVE A FRAMEWORK. OF ONE SIZE

01:48:36.376 --> 01:48:38.812
FITS ALL BUT WE ALL KNEW

01:48:38.879 --> 01:48:39.946
DYNAMICS DIDN'T WORK BECAUSE IT

01:48:40.013 --> 01:48:42.515
WAS ONE SIZE FITS ALL BUT THAT

01:48:42.582 --> 01:48:44.484
WASN'T ENOUGH INTO THEN COME TO

01:48:44.551 --> 01:48:46.019
THIS FLOOR AND SAY WE SHOULD

01:48:46.086 --> 01:48:47.554
VOTE THIS DOWN BECAUSE YOU KNOW

01:48:47.621 --> 01:48:48.822
WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT

01:48:48.889 --> 01:48:50.223
ENOUGH WHEN YOU'VE NEVER EVEN

01:48:50.290 --> 01:48:51.825

BEFORE. IS DISHONEST. IT'S

01:48:58.632 --> 01:49:00.667
INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST. YEAH

01:49:00.734 --> 01:49:02.269
IT'S INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST

01:49:02.335 --> 01:49:04.537
FOR THE OPPOSITION PARTY. TO

01:49:04.604 --> 01:49:06.606
SUGGEST THAT EVERY TIME THEY GO

01:49:06.673 --> 01:49:08.508
OUT THERE THEY COMPLAIN ABOUT

01:49:08.575 --> 01:49:10.944
THE POVERTY IN CALIFORNIA. YET

01:49:11.011 --> 01:49:13.580
SUDDENLY WE WANT TECH COMPANIES

01:49:13.647 --> 01:49:16.650

OF DOLLARS IN STOCK PROFITS. TO

01:49:25.592 --> 01:49:28.194
SAY WE HAVE TO SOMEHOW ALLOW

01:49:28.261 --> 01:49:31.398
THEM THE FLEXIBILITY. TO NOT

01:49:31.464 --> 01:49:34.467
PAY WORKERS A MINIMUM WAGE AND

01:49:34.534 --> 01:49:35.001
YOU WONDER WHY THERE'S TEN

01:49:35.068 --> 01:49:37.003
CITIES IN SACRAMENTO. I'VE HAD

01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:43.510
ENOUGH. I'VE HAD ENOUGH. NOBODY

01:49:43.576 --> 01:49:46.513
WANTS TO OFFER SOLUTIONS THEY

01:49:46.579 --> 01:49:48.515
JUST WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT

01:49:48.581 --> 01:49:51.284
PROBLEMS IN THAT'S DISINGENUOUS

01:49:51.351 --> 01:49:53.119
SO YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE A

01:49:53.186 --> 01:49:55.488

BECAUSE WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE

01:50:00.427 --> 01:50:03.763
DYNAMICS DECISION WE READ IT WE

01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:04.731
TRIED TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE

01:50:04.798 --> 01:50:06.900
COURT WAS COMING FROM. IT

01:50:06.967 --> 01:50:09.336
PROVIDED EXEMPTIONS THAT WORK

01:50:09.402 --> 01:50:11.838
IN THOSE FRAMEWORKS BUT SAID IT

01:50:11.905 --> 01:50:14.541
MATTERS HOW MUCH SOMEBODY MAKES

01:50:14.607 --> 01:50:17.510
AND THEIR JOB HOW MUCH LEVERAGE

01:50:17.577 --> 01:50:20.213
THEY REALLY HAVE TO BARGAIN

01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:20.780
THEIR OWN RATES. COMPETITIVE

01:50:20.847 --> 01:50:25.752
DYNAMICS. YOU'RE NOT FLEXIBLE

01:50:25.819 --> 01:50:26.252
WHEN YOU REALLY HAVE NO

01:50:26.319 --> 01:50:29.856
FLEXIBILITY. WHEN YOU HAVE TO

FOURTH GIG THAT'S NOT

01:50:33.827 --> 01:50:37.630
FLEXIBILITY. THAT'S FEUDALISM

01:50:37.697 --> 01:50:40.133
AND THAT'S WHERE WE'RE GOING IF

01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:43.803
WE DON'T PUT A STOP TO IT.

01:50:43.870 --> 01:50:46.773
WANTED TO STRIKE A BALANCE A

01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:49.509
BALANCE THAT PROTECTS WORKERS.

01:50:49.576 --> 01:50:51.578
IN PROTECT SMALL BUSINESSES

01:50:51.644 --> 01:50:53.980
LEGITIMATE SMALL BUSINESSES

01:50:54.047 --> 01:50:54.514
BECAUSE IF YOU GO IN YOUR

01:50:54.581 --> 01:50:56.016
COMMUNITY AND YOU ASK THE

01:50:56.082 --> 01:50:58.551
PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY ABIDING

01:50:58.618 --> 01:51:00.854
BY THE LAW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:03.123
THEY HAVE TO COMPETE AGAINST A

BUSINESS THAT DOESN'T PAY

01:51:04.224 --> 01:51:06.493

MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME THEY

01:51:13.299 --> 01:51:15.935
CAN NOT CONTINUE TO COMPETE.

01:51:16.002 --> 01:51:17.170
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE WORKERS

01:51:17.237 --> 01:51:19.439
IT'S ABOUT LEGITIMATE SMALL

01:51:19.506 --> 01:51:21.307

PAID INTO SOCIAL SECURITY FOR

01:52:04.417 --> 01:52:07.287
THE WORKERS. MEDICARE WE WONDER

01:52:07.353 --> 01:52:08.021
WHY SOCIAL SECURITY IS

01:52:08.088 --> 01:52:09.823
UNDERFUNDED THIRTY SECOND WEEK

01:52:09.889 --> 01:52:11.524

BIT OF A AT AN EXPRESSION OF

04:39:08.198 --> 04:39:10.100

RUNNING AWAY FOR THEIR LIVES

04:39:28.518 --> 04:39:29.018
THEY WERE RUNNING TOWARD THE

04:39:29.085 --> 04:39:32.755
HORROR. KNOWING FULL WELL THAT

04:39:32.822 --> 04:39:34.858

HEROISM WHEN THOSE. INDIVIDUALS

04:39:45.735 --> 04:39:49.239

04:39:53.309 --> 04:39:55.078
THEY DID SOMETHING VERY HEROIC

04:39:55.145 --> 04:39:55.712
AND THEY KNEW. AT THE TIME THEY

04:39:55.778 --> 04:39:59.115
DID IT. THAT THEY WERE RISKING

04:39:59.182 --> 04:40:01.851

SUCH A WITNESS. AND IT IS A

04:40:30.446 --> 04:40:33.216

04:41:23.233 --> 04:41:24.100
BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET OUT

04:41:24.167 --> 04:41:26.135

WAS RUMORED TO BE HEADED OUR

04:41:27.370 --> 04:41:30.440
WAY. THE FEAR THAT EACH OF US

04:41:30.506 --> 04:41:33.109

04:41:35.878 --> 04:41:37.880
EACH AND EVERYONE OF US AND TO

04:41:37.947 --> 04:41:38.448

AND BEING ON CAPITOL HILL

04:41:51.361 --> 04:41:51.928
WATCHING AS OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE

04:41:51.995 --> 04:41:55.431
SPOKEN. THAT WE KNEW THAT THE

04:41:55.498 --> 04:41:57.166

STAND STRONG. IN THOSE VALUES

04:42:04.674 --> 04:42:06.142
WAS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

04:42:06.209 --> 04:42:08.444
REMEMBER ALWAYS TO HOLD ON TO.

04:42:08.511 --> 04:42:10.446
AND AS WE HAVE VIGOROUS DEBATES

04:42:10.513 --> 04:42:11.080
TODAY AND THROUGH THE REST OF

04:42:11.147 --> 04:42:13.283

05:35:55.435 --> 05:35:57.604

05:41:53.459 --> 05:41:54.827
MANDATES ON BUILDERS AND

05:41:54.894 --> 05:41:56.729
PROPERTY OWNERS WHY WOULD

05:41:56.796 --> 05:41:58.364
ANYONE LOOK TO INVEST IN MULTI

05:41:58.431 --> 05:42:00.633
FAMILY RENTAL HOUSING NOW IN

05:42:00.700 --> 05:42:02.201
FACT A LOT OF THE RENTAL

05:42:02.268 --> 05:42:04.136
HOUSING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

05:42:04.203 --> 05:42:07.640
AND MY DISTRICT IS. WAS BUILT

05:42:07.707 --> 05:42:08.574
BACK THIRTY YEARS AGO OR FORTY

05:42:08.641 --> 05:42:09.742
YEARS AGO THEY'VE BEEN

05:42:09.809 --> 05:42:11.477
RENOVATED BUT THEY'RE STILL

05:42:11.544 --> 05:42:13.512
RENTAL HOUSING AND ALL OF THOSE

05:42:13.579 --> 05:42:16.249
WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THIS BILL.

05:42:16.315 --> 05:42:17.216
AND FOR DECADES NOW THE PROBLEM

05:42:17.283 --> 05:42:20.253
HAS GOTTEN WORSE. WHY ON EARTH

05:42:20.319 --> 05:42:21.053
WOULD WE EXPECT THINGS TO BE

05:42:21.120 --> 05:42:23.022
DIFFERENT THIS TIME AROUND.

05:42:23.089 --> 05:42:24.190
EVERY TIME A BILL LIKE THIS

05:42:24.257 --> 05:42:26.959
COMES UP YOU'RE WARNED OF THE

05:42:27.026 --> 05:42:27.593
IMPACT IT WILL HAVE ON A RENTAL

05:42:27.660 --> 05:42:29.629
MARKETS. AND EVERY TIME THOSE

05:42:29.695 --> 05:42:31.898
WARNINGS FALL ON DEAF EARS AND

05:42:31.964 --> 05:42:32.531
THIS WILL PROBABLY HAPPEN AGAIN

05:42:32.598 --> 05:42:35.601
TODAY. SOME CALIFORNIA CITIES

05:42:35.668 --> 05:42:37.270
ALREADY HAVE RENT CONTROL AND

05:42:37.336 --> 05:42:39.605
MANY OF THOSE CITIES HAVE THE

05:42:39.672 --> 05:42:40.406
ABSOLUTE WORST HOUSING

05:42:40.473 --> 05:42:42.475
CONDITIONS IN THE STATE. THAT'S

05:42:42.541 --> 05:42:45.044
NOT A COINCIDENCE DON'T CREATE

05:42:45.111 --> 05:42:46.445
A SCENARIO WHERE RENTERS WILL

05:42:46.512 --> 05:42:48.848
BE PAYING THE PRICE FOR IT FROM

05:42:48.915 --> 05:42:50.249
THE BACKLASH AGAINST RENT

05:42:50.316 --> 05:42:52.285
CONTROL. IF WE WANT TO SOLVE

05:42:52.351 --> 05:42:53.853
THE HOUSING CRISIS WE NEED TO

05:42:53.920 --> 05:42:55.288

05:42:57.223 --> 05:42:59.592
BUILDERS AND PROPERTY OWNERS.

05:42:59.659 --> 05:43:01.027
ICE CONTROLS AND GOVERNMENT

05:43:01.093 --> 05:43:02.762
CONTROLLED ECONOMY HAVE FAILED

05:43:02.828 --> 05:43:04.463

SUPPLY THE DEMAND IS GREATER

05:47:15.614 --> 05:47:17.750
YOU HAVE LESS OF WHAT PEOPLE

05:47:20.653 --> 05:47:22.588
THE NOTION THAT WE CAN'T

RISK IN THE REWARD. AND THIS

05:48:55.381 --> 05:48:58.317
REALLY IS AS A FAIR DEAL AND

05:48:58.384 --> 05:48:59.652
IT'S ALREADY OUTLINED BY OUR

05:48:59.718 --> 05:49:00.486
AUTHORED OTHERS SPEAKERS AT

05:49:00.552 --> 05:49:02.988
ALL. I'LL I'LL GET INTO THAT IT

05:49:03.055 --> 05:49:04.990
REALLY PER TAXED TENANTS WE'LL

05:49:05.057 --> 05:49:06.125
TALK ABOUT GATHERING IN A

05:49:06.191 --> 05:49:09.028
SECOND. IT STABILIZES THE

05:49:09.094 --> 05:49:12.464
RENTAL HOUSING MARKET. AND IT'S

05:49:12.531 --> 05:49:14.099
VERY REASONABLE FOR PROPERTY

05:49:14.166 --> 05:49:17.069
OWNERS. IT'S NOT RENT CONTROL

05:49:17.136 --> 05:49:20.172
IT'S NOT LOOK IN NEW YORK IN IN

05:49:20.239 --> 05:49:21.507
DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA

05:49:21.573 --> 05:49:23.042
WHERE THEY HAVE THE SMALL

05:49:23.108 --> 05:49:25.277
INCREASES. THAT REALLY COULD

05:49:25.344 --> 05:49:27.279
UPSET THE APPLE CART AS FAR AS

05:49:27.346 --> 05:49:28.580
SUPPLY I'VE I'VE PROBABLY WILL

05:49:28.647 --> 05:49:30.683
NOT SUPPORT THOSE MEASURES. BUT

05:49:30.749 --> 05:49:32.918
HAVING A MEASURE WERE YOU CAN

05:49:32.985 --> 05:49:35.554
GO UP 28% AN INCREASE. IS

05:49:35.621 --> 05:49:37.156
TOTALLY REASONABLE AND THE

05:49:37.222 --> 05:49:38.757
EXEMPTIONS FOR EXEMPTING NEW

05:49:38.824 --> 05:49:40.693
HOUSING. FOR THE FIRST FIFTEEN

05:49:40.759 --> 05:49:43.629
YEARS EXEMPTING DUPLEXES SINGLE

05:49:43.696 --> 05:49:45.431
FAMILY HOUSING FRANKLY MOST OF

05:49:45.497 --> 05:49:49.168
THAT. THE MAIN STREET TYPE

05:49:49.234 --> 05:49:50.002
PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE RENTAL

05:49:50.069 --> 05:49:51.303
HOUSING INDUSTRY THE BIG

05:49:51.370 --> 05:49:53.706
CORPORATIONS WHO WOULD HAVE THE

05:49:53.772 --> 05:49:54.239
MIST AT STAKE. THEY'RE NOT

05:49:54.306 --> 05:49:56.241
OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. THERE ARE

05:49:56.308 --> 05:49:58.577
OPPOSED SO THE MEASURES THAT WE

05:49:58.644 --> 05:49:59.478
HAVE IN HERE AS FAR AS

05:49:59.545 --> 05:50:03.582
IMPACTING. SMALL OWNERS ARE

05:50:03.649 --> 05:50:04.983
FRANKLY VERY FAIR AND I WOULD

05:50:05.050 --> 05:50:06.952
KNOW FIRST HAND. BECAUSE MY

05:50:07.019 --> 05:50:08.654
FUND TO PAY FOR MY LITTLE GIRLS

05:50:08.721 --> 05:50:11.123
COLLEGE FUND. IS ON THREE UNITS

05:50:11.190 --> 05:50:13.659
I HAVE RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO.

05:50:13.726 --> 05:50:16.328
AND IF YOU CAN'T MAKE A GOOD

05:50:16.395 --> 05:50:17.363
RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT

05:50:17.429 --> 05:50:19.164
HAVING IT UP TO AN 8% INCREASE

05:50:19.231 --> 05:50:21.967
IN YOUR RENT. YOU ARE A POOR

05:50:22.034 --> 05:50:23.702
PROPERTY OWNERS YOU CAN DO THE

05:50:23.769 --> 05:50:25.404
REPAIRS BE FAIR TO YOUR

05:50:25.471 --> 05:50:28.974
TENANTS. AND HAVE A GOOD

05:50:29.041 --> 05:50:29.508
BUSINESS MODEL. EARLIER I

05:50:29.575 --> 05:50:33.679
TALKED ABOUT. THE HARM IN THE

05:50:33.746 --> 05:50:35.981
GOOD EVERY TIME WE PRESS THESE

05:50:36.048 --> 05:50:36.982
BUTTONS. WE KNOW THAT RAN

05:50:37.049 --> 05:50:40.552
GALGIANI. HAS ITS IMPACT WE'VE

05:50:40.619 --> 05:50:41.820
HEARD STORY AFTER STORY OF

05:50:41.887 --> 05:50:44.857
INDIVIDUALS HAVING A TWENTY

05:50:44.923 --> 05:50:46.225
THIRTY FORTY SOMETIMES A 50%

05:50:46.291 --> 05:50:49.094
INCREASE IN THE RENT. IT'S JUST

05:50:49.161 --> 05:50:51.663
NOT FAIR AND IT'S MORE LIKELY

05:50:51.730 --> 05:50:53.132
THEY'RE GONNA END UP HERE. ON

05:50:53.198 --> 05:50:55.467
K. STREET MALL OR MAYBE THEY

05:50:55.534 --> 05:50:56.702
WILL BE HOMELESS BUT THEY'LL

05:50:56.769 --> 05:50:58.036
PUT THEY'LL GO DOWN TO THE

05:50:58.103 --> 05:51:00.172
LOWER INCOME HOUSING THAT

05:51:00.239 --> 05:51:01.373
PERSON WILL GET SQUEEZED DOWN

05:51:01.440 --> 05:51:02.307
TO THE SINGLE ROOM OCCUPANCY

05:51:02.374 --> 05:51:03.842
HOUSING AND THAT PERSONAL BE

05:51:03.909 --> 05:51:05.344
LEFT OUT HERE SLEEPING ON K.

05:51:05.411 --> 05:51:06.945
STREET MALL SO THERE IS A REAL

05:51:07.012 --> 05:51:08.547
CORRELATION. AS WE KNOW

05:51:08.614 --> 05:51:10.949
RESEARCH SHOWS EVERY 10%

05:51:11.016 --> 05:51:12.484
INCREASE IN RENT IN A

05:51:12.551 --> 05:51:14.486
METROPOLITAN AREA CORRELATES TO

05:51:14.553 --> 05:51:17.589
A 9% INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS

05:51:17.656 --> 05:51:20.025

THAT WAS MY SHARE OF THAT

05:51:42.481 --> 05:51:44.016
LITTLE HOW. TWO DOLLARS A MONTH

05:51:44.082 --> 05:51:46.118

05:51:46.185 --> 05:51:48.387
PEOPLE OUT AND YOU CAN'T HAVE A

05:51:48.454 --> 05:51:51.423
FAIR RENTAL HOUSING MARKET AND

MAKE SURE YOU DON'T UPSET THE

05:51:52.591 --> 05:51:54.259
APPLE CART TOO MUCH IN

SACRAMENTO LAST SEVEN YEARS THE

05:51:56.795 --> 05:51:58.764
AVERAGE RENT HERE IN THE

CENTRAL CITY. HAS INCREASED BY

05:51:59.431 --> 05:52:04.336
45% 45% WE KNOW THAT SALARIES

05:52:04.403 --> 05:52:06.605
HAVE NOT INCREASED BY THAT MUCH

05:52:06.672 --> 05:52:07.940
ANNUAL WAGES FOR PEOPLE AND

05:52:08.006 --> 05:52:09.341
STATE GOVERNMENT HAVE IT NOT

05:52:09.408 --> 05:52:11.143
INCREASE THAT MUCH. AND THIS IS

05:52:11.210 --> 05:52:13.111
A FAIR MEASURE THAT WILL

05:52:13.178 --> 05:52:14.847
PROTECT THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY

05:52:14.913 --> 05:52:19.418

05:52:31.730 --> 05:52:34.333
MEMBERS AND MISTER SPEAKER

05:52:34.399 --> 05:52:36.535
MEMBERS ON THIS FLOOR EVERY DAY

05:52:36.602 --> 05:52:39.404
BUT TYPICALLY AT THIS TIME OF

05:52:39.471 --> 05:52:41.540
OUR SESSION WE GRAPPLE WITH

05:52:41.607 --> 05:52:43.675
DECISIONS THAT ACTUALLY CAN BE

05:52:43.742 --> 05:52:46.411
VERY STRESSFUL WE CAN BE

05:52:46.478 --> 05:52:49.481
CONFLICTED MEANING WE SEE BOTH

05:52:49.548 --> 05:52:52.251
SIDES OF AN ARGUMENT WE CA AND

05:52:52.317 --> 05:52:54.419
LISTEN TO THE OPPOSITION AND WE

05:52:54.486 --> 05:52:56.755
LISTENED TO THOSE THAT SUPPORT

05:52:56.822 --> 05:52:59.157
AND SOMETIMES IN MY CASE LIKE

05:52:59.224 --> 05:53:01.093
AN ORANGE COUNTY THESE CHOICES

05:53:01.159 --> 05:53:03.929
ARE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. WE

05:53:03.996 --> 05:53:06.798
HAVE NO LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES

05:53:06.865 --> 05:53:08.233
THAT HAVE RENT CONTROL IN

05:53:08.300 --> 05:53:10.402
ORANGE COUNTY SO THIS CERTAINLY

05:53:10.469 --> 05:53:14.239
WOULD BE A CHANGE. FOR

05:53:14.306 --> 05:53:14.873
LEGISLATOR TO SUPPORT SOMETHING

05:53:14.940 --> 05:53:16.508
LIKE THIS BUT THROUGHOUT THE

05:53:16.575 --> 05:53:18.210
YEAR I'VE NOT ONLY BEEN

05:53:18.277 --> 05:53:19.244
LISTENING I'VE BEEN WATCHING

05:53:19.311 --> 05:53:21.513
AND SEEN AND AS HAS BEEN

05:53:21.580 --> 05:53:23.081
MENTIONED NOT ONLY ON THIS

05:53:23.148 --> 05:53:24.249
FLOOR IN THIS CITY BUT

05:53:24.316 --> 05:53:25.150
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

05:53:25.217 --> 05:53:27.586
CALIFORNIA WE ARE NOW SEEN

05:53:27.653 --> 05:53:30.088
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

05:53:30.155 --> 05:53:31.723
STRUGGLING WITH NOT ONLY

05:53:31.790 --> 05:53:34.026
HOMELESSNESS BUT BEING VERY

05:53:34.092 --> 05:53:35.427
CLOSE TO BEING HOMELESS. BY

05:53:35.494 --> 05:53:38.497
BEING ON ABLE TO AFFORD THE

05:53:38.564 --> 05:53:41.867
RENT IN FULLER TWO AND WE HAD

05:53:41.934 --> 05:53:44.102
TO CITIES FULLER TEN AND

05:53:44.169 --> 05:53:45.704
ANAHEIM WHERE THE COUNCILS

05:53:45.771 --> 05:53:47.906
WERE. HAD MANY MANY

05:53:47.973 --> 05:53:49.875
CONSTITUENTS COME BECAUSE A

05:53:49.942 --> 05:53:52.544
LANDLORD RAISE THE RENT ABOUT

05:53:52.611 --> 05:53:55.747
20% WITH THE NOTIFICATION IN

05:53:55.814 --> 05:53:57.115
MOBILE HOMES NOW MOBILE HOMES

05:53:57.182 --> 05:53:58.951
ARE EXEMPTED FROM THIS BUT THEY

05:53:59.017 --> 05:54:00.886
CAME INTO THE COUNCIL WEEK

05:54:00.953 --> 05:54:03.088
AFTER WEEK TO TRY TO GET RELIEF

05:54:03.155 --> 05:54:05.424
MANY OF THESE CONSTITUENTS WERE

05:54:05.490 --> 05:54:08.594
VETERANS SENIORS IN HAD MOVED

05:54:08.660 --> 05:54:09.928
IN FEELING LIKE THEY WOULD HAVE

05:54:09.995 --> 05:54:13.865
A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE. NOW THEIR

05:54:13.932 --> 05:54:17.803
PLAN IS WHAT DO WE DO NOW. THEY

05:54:17.869 --> 05:54:18.403
HAVE A LITTLE REPRIEVE BECAUSE

05:54:18.470 --> 05:54:19.004
THE COUNCIL WORKED WITH THEM

05:54:19.071 --> 05:54:19.671
BUT MANY DO NOT HAVE THIS SO WE

05:54:19.738 --> 05:54:20.772
ARE NOT ONLY IN A HOMELESS

05:54:20.839 --> 05:54:22.507
CRISIS WHAT WERE IN A HOUSING

05:54:22.574 --> 05:54:24.743
CRISIS AND WE HAVE THE MORAL.

05:54:24.810 --> 05:54:27.212
AUTHORITY TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT

05:54:27.279 --> 05:54:27.846
AND DO IT DOING WHAT'S RIGHT IS

05:54:27.913 --> 05:54:32.317
NOT EASY. I WON'T GO AS FAR AS

05:54:32.384 --> 05:54:33.418
SAYING THERE'S THREATS BUT

05:54:33.485 --> 05:54:35.654
THERE ARE THREATS. DOING WHAT

05:54:35.721 --> 05:54:37.589
IS SAFE IS WHAT IS EASY. AND

05:54:37.656 --> 05:54:40.659
DOING WHAT IS TOUGH. TAKES

05:54:40.726 --> 05:54:42.861
COURAGE IN SOMETIMES COURAGE IS

05:54:42.928 --> 05:54:45.297
HARD TO FIND. I KNOW I LIKE

05:54:45.364 --> 05:54:48.000
BEING A LEGISLATOR. BUT I WANT

05:54:48.066 --> 05:54:50.002
TO SEE PEOPLE HOUSE MORE THAN I

05:54:50.068 --> 05:54:52.270
CARE ABOUT BEING A LEGISLATOR

05:54:52.337 --> 05:54:55.807
WHEN I WALK OUTSIDE AND I KNOW.

05:54:55.874 --> 05:54:56.408
BECAUSE I'VE COUNTED THERE ARE

05:54:56.475 --> 05:54:58.944
PEOPLE LIVING ON THIS. THIS

05:54:59.011 --> 05:55:01.847
GREAT PARK THAT ARE HOMELESS WE

05:55:01.913 --> 05:55:03.181

05:55:03.248 --> 05:55:04.750
SERGEANTS KNOW THAT I KNOW THE

05:55:04.816 --> 05:55:06.785
POLICE KNOW THAT I SEE THEM IN

05:55:06.852 --> 05:55:08.887
THE MORNING IN THE SAME PLACE.

05:55:08.954 --> 05:55:11.490
FOLDING UP THEIR BLANKETS.

05:55:11.556 --> 05:55:13.725
HEARING THERE TWO BACKPACKS

05:55:13.792 --> 05:55:15.293
THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE

05:55:15.360 --> 05:55:17.095
HOMELESS AND WE HAVE ACTED THIS

05:55:17.162 --> 05:55:19.331
YEAR WE'VE ACTED ON ON

ASPECT IT WON'T BE ONE BILL IT

05:55:28.874 --> 05:55:31.343
WILL TAKE MULTIPLE. TYPES OF

05:55:31.410 --> 05:55:31.910
LEGISLATION AND IT WILL TAKE

05:55:31.977 --> 05:55:34.279
YOUR WILL. I TALKED TO MY GREAT

05:55:51.263 --> 05:55:52.831
ASKED THEM WHAT WHY DID THEY

05:55:52.898 --> 05:55:55.801
NOT HAVE THE SAME SITUATION WE

05:55:55.867 --> 05:55:56.702
HAVE AND THEY SAID BECAUSE THEY

05:55:56.768 --> 05:56:00.005
MADE A DECISION. TO ACT AND

05:56:00.072 --> 05:56:02.340
THEY HAVE THE WILL SO I ASK YOU

05:56:02.407 --> 05:56:05.811

AUTHOR HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY

05:56:11.416 --> 05:56:13.719
BUT IT IS ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS

05:56:13.785 --> 05:56:15.320
AND WE DON'T ACT WE STAY IN THE

05:56:15.387 --> 05:56:17.923
SAME PLACE. AND WE NEED TO ACT

05:56:17.989 --> 05:56:19.157

ABOUT THE SAME ISSUES BUT WITH

05:56:23.228 --> 05:56:25.497
MORE PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS SO I

05:56:30.669 --> 05:56:32.204
LIKE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

05:56:32.270 --> 05:56:32.704
DEBATE PLEASE RAISE YOUR

05:56:32.771 --> 05:56:35.273
MICROPHONES AT THIS TIME. MR

05:56:35.340 --> 05:56:42.447
MURATSUCHI. THAT'S A TOUGH VOTE

05:56:42.514 --> 05:56:46.451
FOR ME. IT SEEMS LIKE ALL OF MY

05:56:46.518 --> 05:56:49.755
CONSTITUENTS. HAVE BECOME

05:56:49.821 --> 05:56:50.322
REALTORS IN THE LAST COUPLE

05:56:50.388 --> 05:56:58.830
DAYS. BUT I'M GONNA SUPPORT

05:56:58.897 --> 05:57:02.000
THIS BILL. BECAUSE I FEEL THAT

05:57:02.067 --> 05:57:05.470
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. IN

05:57:05.537 --> 05:57:09.241
ALL THE REALTORS. THAT HAVE

05:57:09.307 --> 05:57:10.442
BEEN CALLING ME AND TWEETING ME

05:57:10.509 --> 05:57:13.545
AND EMAILING ME THAT ALL BEEN

05:57:13.612 --> 05:57:14.146
SAYING THE SAME THING THAT THE

05:57:14.212 --> 05:57:19.284
SAME TALKING POINT. THAT. THE

05:57:19.351 --> 05:57:19.818
SOLUTION IS TO BUILD MORE

05:57:19.885 --> 05:57:23.655
HOUSING. BUT I THINK WE ALL

05:57:23.722 --> 05:57:26.958
KNOW THAT BUILDING MORE HOUSING

05:57:27.025 --> 05:57:28.927
IS GOING TO TAKE A LOT OF TIME.

05:57:28.994 --> 05:57:32.264
AND IN THE MEANTIME. IN MY

05:57:32.330 --> 05:57:35.801
COMMUNITY AND MY. EVEN IN MY

05:57:35.867 --> 05:57:37.235
AFFLUENT PARTS OF MY DISTRICT

05:57:37.302 --> 05:57:41.106
I'M HEARING. FOR MORE STORIES

05:57:41.173 --> 05:57:42.340
OF PEOPLE THAT CAN'T KEEP UP

05:57:42.407 --> 05:57:45.210
WITH THEIR RENTS. THAT THAT

05:57:45.277 --> 05:57:45.811
THAT YOU KNOW EXPERIENCING RAN

05:57:45.877 --> 05:57:49.414
GALLON XING. AND THEY'RE BEING

05:57:49.481 --> 05:57:51.583
EVICTED. SO THAT THE LANDLORDS

05:57:51.650 --> 05:57:57.856
CAN JACK UP THE RENTS. AND SO.

05:57:57.923 --> 05:58:02.394
YOU KNOW I FEEL THAT TO. THAT

05:58:02.460 --> 05:58:04.229
WE NEED TO SIDE WITH THE

05:58:04.296 --> 05:58:08.767
RENTERS ON THIS ONE. BECAUSE I

05:58:08.834 --> 05:58:09.401
BELIEVE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO

05:58:09.467 --> 05:58:16.341
DO. THANK YOU MISTER MURATSUCHI

05:58:16.408 --> 05:58:20.879
MISTER MAYES YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

05:58:20.946 --> 05:58:21.379
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER

05:58:21.446 --> 05:58:26.284
MEMBERS I. RISE IN OPPOSITION

05:58:26.351 --> 05:58:29.287
TO THIS LEGISLATION AND WHICH I

05:58:29.354 --> 05:58:31.857
DON'T OFTEN RISE TO OPPOSE

05:58:31.923 --> 05:58:32.858
ESPECIALLY SINCE I HAVE A GREAT

05:58:32.924 --> 05:58:35.627
AFFECTION FOR THE AUTHOR AND I

05:58:35.694 --> 05:58:37.662
KNOW HOW MUCH WORK THAT HE HAS

05:58:37.729 --> 05:58:42.267
DONE ON THIS BILL THE ISSUE FOR

05:58:42.334 --> 05:58:44.870
ME. IS THE ISSUE OF BANKING.

05:58:44.936 --> 05:58:47.806
AND I FEAR THAT WITH THIS BILL

05:58:47.873 --> 05:58:51.243
BEFORE US TODAY THAT FOR SOME

05:58:51.309 --> 05:58:52.544
PARTS OF THE STATE WILL PROVIDE

05:58:52.611 --> 05:58:54.613
SOME RELIEF. FOR UPWARD

05:58:54.679 --> 05:58:56.348
PRESSURE WITHIN THE RENTAL

05:58:56.414 --> 05:58:58.350
MARKET BUT ALSO WILL DISTORT

05:58:58.416 --> 05:58:59.985
THE MARKET. IN INLAND

05:59:00.051 --> 05:59:02.454
CALIFORNIA IN IN MY DISTRICT

05:59:02.520 --> 05:59:04.155
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS

05:59:04.222 --> 05:59:06.491
THERE IS NO PROVISION IN THIS A

05:59:06.558 --> 05:59:08.760
BILL THAT SAYS THAT EVERY YEAR

05:59:08.827 --> 05:59:10.128
THAT'S CALLED SEVEN AND A HALF

05:59:10.195 --> 05:59:12.097
A PERCENT PER YEAR LANDLORDS

05:59:12.163 --> 05:59:13.632
ARE GOING TO RAISE THEIR RIGHT

05:59:13.698 --> 05:59:15.300
THERE THEIR RENT. EVERY SINGLE

05:59:15.367 --> 05:59:18.169
YEAR SEVEN AND A HALF 8% WHEN

05:59:18.236 --> 05:59:20.672
IN SOME PARTS OF MY DISTRICT

05:59:20.739 --> 05:59:21.273
THEY'RE NOT RAISING THEIR RENT

05:59:21.339 --> 05:59:23.541
AND THEY CAN'T BANK THAT. SO

05:59:23.608 --> 05:59:24.943
EVERY SINGLE YEAR THEY'RE GONNA

05:59:25.010 --> 05:59:27.012
RAISE SEVEN A HALF A PERCENT

05:59:27.078 --> 05:59:28.980
MAYBE IF THEY HAD DONE IT FOR

05:59:29.047 --> 05:59:29.881
THREE YEARS NOW THEY'RE GOING

05:59:29.948 --> 05:59:32.250
TO DO THAT I WAS. AT AN EVENT

05:59:32.317 --> 05:59:34.219
THIS WEEKEND AND I HAD SEVERAL

05:59:34.286 --> 05:59:35.887
PEOPLE TELL ME THAT THEY WERE

05:59:35.954 --> 05:59:37.022
GOING TO BE DOING THAT IN FACT

05:59:37.088 --> 05:59:45.163
THE ONE LANDLORDS SAID. SENT.

05:59:45.230 --> 05:59:47.866
SO UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL I

05:59:47.933 --> 05:59:49.334
THINK HAS SOME UNINTENDED

05:59:49.401 --> 05:59:51.002
CONSEQUENCES FOR SOME PARTS OF

05:59:51.069 --> 05:59:52.070
THE STATE IT WILL PROVIDE

05:59:52.137 --> 05:59:54.272
RELIEF BUT FOR OTHER PARTS OF

05:59:54.339 --> 05:59:55.240
THE STATE IT WILL ACTUALLY

05:59:55.307 --> 05:59:56.408
DISTORT THE MARKET AND THEY

05:59:56.474 --> 05:59:57.509
WILL END UP BEING UPWARD

05:59:57.575 --> 05:59:58.777
PRESSURE AND ACTUALLY INCREASE

05:59:58.843 --> 06:00:00.879
THE COST OF HOUSING. SO

06:00:00.946 --> 06:00:01.446
REGRETFULLY MEL B. OPPOSING

06:00:01.513 --> 06:00:04.616
TODAY. FAMOUS REYES MEASURE

06:00:04.683 --> 06:00:09.621
COOLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED.

06:00:09.688 --> 06:00:11.823
COLLEAGUES I AM OF PLEASED TO

06:00:11.890 --> 06:00:12.424
RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS

06:00:12.490 --> 06:00:16.394
MAJOR. AND I FIND IT

06:00:16.461 --> 06:00:18.763
INTERESTING BILL A CHANNEL SO

06:00:18.830 --> 06:00:20.031
MUCH OF MY LIFE IT SEEMS THIS

06:00:20.098 --> 06:00:22.934
TOPIC. DRAWS TOGETHER A GREAT

06:00:23.001 --> 06:00:27.205
DEAL FOR ME. I WAS ADMITTED THE

06:00:27.272 --> 06:00:28.039
PRACTICE OF LAW IN NINETEEN

06:00:28.106 --> 06:00:30.342
EIGHTY FOUR. MY FIRST CLIENT

06:00:30.408 --> 06:00:32.477
WAS IN WHAT'S REFERRED TO AS

06:00:32.544 --> 06:00:33.578
THE SHELTER INDUSTRY HERE IN

06:00:33.645 --> 06:00:35.613
CALIFORNIA. AND I WORKED IN

06:00:35.680 --> 06:00:39.351
THAT INDUSTRY. UNTIL THIS HOUSE

06:00:39.417 --> 06:00:40.952
RECRUITED ME TO COME BACK IN A

06:00:41.019 --> 06:00:42.921
RUN THE BANKING FINANCE

06:00:42.988 --> 06:00:44.389
INSURANCE COMMITTEE IN THE LATE

06:00:44.456 --> 06:00:47.158
NINETEEN EIGHTIES. SO I LOOK AT

06:00:47.225 --> 06:00:49.227
IT SORT OF THROUGH THE LENS OF

06:00:49.294 --> 06:00:51.196
MY LAW CAREER WORK IN THE

06:00:51.262 --> 06:00:54.699
SHELTER INDUSTRY. ON THE SUPPLY

06:00:54.766 --> 06:00:55.266
SIDE ON THE FINANCE SIDE FOR

06:00:55.333 --> 06:00:58.003
THIS HOUSE. I REMEMBER ONE OF

06:00:58.069 --> 06:00:59.270
THE FIRST THINGS I LOOKED AT

06:00:59.337 --> 06:01:01.639
WAS THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE

06:01:01.706 --> 06:01:02.774
WAS THE SIGNING OF THE DAVIS

06:01:02.841 --> 06:01:03.575
STIRLING COMMON INTEREST

06:01:03.641 --> 06:01:05.543
DEVELOPMENT ACT. WHICH IS

06:01:05.610 --> 06:01:06.644
IMPLICATED IN THIS BILL BECAUSE

06:01:06.711 --> 06:01:08.246
IT'S COMMON INTEREST

06:01:08.313 --> 06:01:10.648
DEVELOPMENTS CONDOS SO CALLED

06:01:10.715 --> 06:01:11.249
ARE REMOVED FROM THE SCOPE OF

06:01:11.316 --> 06:01:16.254
THIS BILL. I DO THINK THAT

06:01:16.321 --> 06:01:17.756
THERE IS ISSUES IN HERE FOR US

06:01:17.822 --> 06:01:19.557
ON A GOAL FOR BASED SYSTEMS

06:01:19.624 --> 06:01:20.692
LAWMAKERS WE ARE GOING TO WANT

06:01:20.759 --> 06:01:22.927
TO PAY ATTENTION TO. BUT I

06:01:22.994 --> 06:01:23.928
DON'T THINK THERE FATAL TO THE

06:01:23.995 --> 06:01:26.398
APPROVAL THIS BILL TODAY. I

06:01:26.464 --> 06:01:27.265
THINK AS A GENERAL MATTER WE'RE

06:01:27.332 --> 06:01:29.601
GOING TO WANT TO WATCH. IT

06:01:29.667 --> 06:01:31.102
PEOPLE BRING FORWARD THE

06:01:31.169 --> 06:01:33.538
ARGUMENT. THAT WE MIGHT IT JUST

06:01:33.605 --> 06:01:34.773
THE RULES TO PROMOTE AND

06:01:34.839 --> 06:01:38.009
SUPPORT MAINTENANCE. OF LONG

06:01:38.076 --> 06:01:39.344
ESTABLISHED FACILITIES WHETHER

06:01:39.411 --> 06:01:41.613
CONDOS ARE SINGLE FAMILY OR

06:01:41.679 --> 06:01:44.349
DUPLEXES OR CRY TAXES OR- FOUR

06:01:44.416 --> 06:01:46.251
PLEXUS. I DON'T DOUBT BE A

06:01:46.317 --> 06:01:47.652
RIGHTEOUS THING TO LOOK AT THIS

06:01:47.719 --> 06:01:49.454
DOES HAVE A TEN YEAR SUNSET. I

06:01:49.521 --> 06:01:50.422
THINK THEY'LL BE OPPORTUNITY TO

06:01:50.488 --> 06:01:51.923
KIND OF SUPPORT. THE

06:01:51.990 --> 06:01:53.058
PRESERVATION OF OUR HOUSING

06:01:53.124 --> 06:01:56.728
STOCK GOING FORWARD. BUT I

06:01:56.795 --> 06:01:57.262
DON'T I SEE THAT AS A VERY

06:01:57.328 --> 06:02:00.031
SUBORDINATE ISSUE. TO THIS I

06:02:00.098 --> 06:02:03.768
THINK THE USE OF A- CPI. TO

06:02:03.835 --> 06:02:06.037
HELP ESCALATE. THE CAP. OR TO

06:02:06.104 --> 06:02:07.739
ENLARGE THE CAP IS ACTUALLY

06:02:07.806 --> 06:02:10.141
GOOD I TEND NOT TO LIKE CPI'S.

06:02:10.208 --> 06:02:12.343
OFTEN VOTE AGAINST A BUT IN

06:02:12.410 --> 06:02:12.911
THIS CONTEXT I SEE IT ALL TO

06:02:12.977 --> 06:02:17.482
THE GOOD. AND. SO I LOOK AT IT

06:02:17.549 --> 06:02:22.587
IS IT IT. THE WAY IT ADDRESSES

06:02:22.654 --> 06:02:23.188
THE HOUSING MARKET THE WAY IT

06:02:23.254 --> 06:02:26.691
PROVIDES A. LARGE CEILING ON

06:02:26.758 --> 06:02:29.627
RATE INCREASES THE FACT THAT

06:02:29.694 --> 06:02:33.231
THERE IS THAT SUNSET. I THINK

06:02:33.298 --> 06:02:34.866
THESE ARE PROVISIONS WHICH GIVE

06:02:34.933 --> 06:02:36.568
A LOT OF ROOM FOR DIFFERENT

06:02:36.634 --> 06:02:39.771
JURISDICTIONS TO LET. FOLKS WHO

06:02:39.838 --> 06:02:42.841
HAVE PROPERTIES OPERATE WITHIN

06:02:42.907 --> 06:02:46.010
THIS FRAMEWORK AND. SO THAT IT

06:02:46.077 --> 06:02:50.315
COMES DOWN TO JUST THE DECISION

06:02:50.381 --> 06:02:50.915
AS WE AS MEMBERS ON THE FOR TO

06:02:50.982 --> 06:02:56.321
DECIDE WHERE WE ARE. AND. I

06:02:56.387 --> 06:02:58.623
CAN'T HELP MYSELF I GOT A QUOTE

06:02:58.690 --> 06:02:59.190
OF THE FAMOUS OLD TESTAMENT

06:02:59.257 --> 06:03:01.359
PROPHET ISAIAH. BUT I'LL TELL

06:03:01.426 --> 06:03:06.331
YOU TWO THINGS ABOUT THAT. THE

06:03:06.397 --> 06:03:06.931
VERSE I'M GONNA SHARE ACTUALLY

06:03:06.998 --> 06:03:09.901
INCLUDES THE WORD SHELTER. AS

06:03:09.968 --> 06:03:11.002
IT HAD SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT

06:03:11.069 --> 06:03:12.837
SHELTER AND WE'RE DIVERSE IN

06:03:12.904 --> 06:03:14.873
QUESTION IS TO ME. THE BEST

06:03:14.939 --> 06:03:19.110
IMAGE. OF LEADERSHIP FOR OTHERS

06:03:19.177 --> 06:03:23.047
DELIVER FINE. AND I WILL TELL

06:03:23.114 --> 06:03:24.983
YOU IS KIND OF UNUSUAL BECAUSE

06:03:25.049 --> 06:03:25.550
IT'S A PICTURE FRANKLY OF A

06:03:25.617 --> 06:03:29.587
ROCK. ON A LANDSCAPE. AND

06:03:29.654 --> 06:03:33.224
APPARENTLY INANIMATE OBJECTS.

06:03:33.291 --> 06:03:33.825
IS THE IMAGE THAT ISAIAH PULLS

06:03:33.892 --> 06:03:39.364
UP. HE SAYS A KING SHALL RULE

06:03:39.430 --> 06:03:43.468
WITH RIGHTEOUSNESS OKAY AS A IS

06:03:43.535 --> 06:03:45.403
TALKING ABOUT A GOVERNMENT

06:03:45.470 --> 06:03:47.906
WE'RE GOOD WORK IS BEING DONE.

06:03:47.972 --> 06:03:49.641
IT'S PROSTHETIC WHEN HE USES IT

06:03:49.707 --> 06:03:51.576
BUT WE GET A FIRM HE'S TALK

06:03:51.643 --> 06:03:52.177
ABOUT A- PLACE WHERE THERE'S A

06:03:52.243 --> 06:03:54.679
GOOD GOVERNMENT. AND HE SAYS

06:03:54.746 --> 06:03:59.083
EACH ONE EACH PERSON. WE'LL BE

06:03:59.150 --> 06:04:03.421
LIKE A SHELTER FROM THE STORM.

06:04:03.488 --> 06:04:04.289
SO WE'RE GOVERNOR'S TO HIS WORK

06:04:04.355 --> 06:04:06.524
THERE IS A RESULT PEOPLE ARE

06:04:06.591 --> 06:04:09.194
FINDING SHELTER FROM THE STORM

06:04:09.260 --> 06:04:09.727
A WHAT IS A CHARACTER THE

06:04:09.794 --> 06:04:12.764
SHELTER HE TALKS ABOUT. LIKE

06:04:12.830 --> 06:04:14.465
STREAMS OF WATER IN THE DESERT

06:04:14.532 --> 06:04:18.002
AND THE SHADOW. OF A GREAT ROCK.

06:04:18.069 --> 06:04:20.338
IN A WEARY LAND A THIRSTY LAND.

06:04:20.405 --> 06:04:26.044
THIS IMAGES ONE. THAT WHEN

06:04:26.110 --> 06:04:27.912
PEOPLE AROUND IN THE JUDEAN

06:04:27.979 --> 06:04:30.181
DESERT AND IT'S THE SUMMER.

06:04:30.248 --> 06:04:34.786
IT'S A SCORCHING PLACE.

06:04:34.852 --> 06:04:35.386
SCORCHING PLACE AND HOSPITABLE

06:04:35.453 --> 06:04:39.924
TO LIFE. AND AS A SAYS.

06:04:39.991 --> 06:04:42.694
LEADERSHIP IS LIKE A ROCK IN

06:04:42.760 --> 06:04:45.530
THE DESERT IT OPPOSES ITSELF.

06:04:45.597 --> 06:04:46.130
BETWEEN THE FORCES OF ESCORTS

06:04:46.197 --> 06:04:50.001
SOMEBODY. SO I TO CREATE

06:04:50.068 --> 06:04:52.036
SHELTER THIRTY SECONDS COOLEY

06:04:52.103 --> 06:04:53.705
AND INCIDENTALLY IT MEANS THE

06:04:53.771 --> 06:04:56.474
PERSON WHO FUNCTIONS LIKE THAT

06:04:56.541 --> 06:04:57.108
ROCK MAY TAKE SOME OF THAT HEAT

06:19:55.239 --> 06:19:55.772
TO MAKE SURE WE ARE BUILDING

06:19:55.839 --> 06:19:58.342
MORE HOUSING AT ALL INCOMES.

06:19:58.408 --> 06:19:59.643
BUT IT'S A FALSE CHOICE TO SAY

06:19:59.710 --> 06:20:01.712
WE EITHER NEED TO BUILD. OR

06:20:01.778 --> 06:20:02.746
PROTECT TENANTS WE HAVE TO DO

06:20:02.813 --> 06:20:05.015
BOTH OF THOSE THINGS. TO GET US

06:20:05.082 --> 06:20:05.983
OUT OF THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE IN

06:20:06.049 --> 06:20:08.952
RIGHT NOW. AND WE CAN SHOULD

06:20:09.019 --> 06:20:09.486
AND MUST DO BOTH OF THOSE

06:20:09.553 --> 06:20:14.124
THINGS. NOW SOME SAY. THIS IS

06:20:14.191 --> 06:20:14.758
GOING TO EXACERBATE THE HOUSING

06:20:14.825 --> 06:20:16.560
CRISIS BECAUSE IT WILL SLOW

06:20:16.627 --> 06:20:17.161
DOWN PRODUCTION. THE BUILDERS

06:20:17.227 --> 06:20:18.595
DON'T AGREE WITH THAT. THEY

06:20:18.662 --> 06:20:21.832
SAID THIS WON'T DO THAT. THOSE

06:20:21.899 --> 06:20:22.399
ARE THE FOLKS THAT BILL THE

06:20:22.466 --> 06:20:25.736
HOUSING IN OUR STATE. I THINK

06:20:25.802 --> 06:20:28.038
WE ARE MORALLY OBLIGATED TO

06:20:28.105 --> 06:20:30.274
TAKE ACTION TODAY AND TO PASS

06:20:30.340 --> 06:20:31.375
THIS BILL THERE HAVE BEEN MANY

06:20:31.441 --> 06:20:32.809
CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDER

06:20:32.876 --> 06:20:34.211
STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE AISLE

06:20:34.278 --> 06:20:36.180
ON THIS. AND IS IT A PERFECT

06:20:36.246 --> 06:20:37.314
BILL NO BUT IS IT GOING TO

06:20:37.381 --> 06:20:39.283
PROVIDE SOME BASIC PROTECTIONS

06:20:39.349 --> 06:20:41.752
TO FOLKS THAT NEED IT MOST YES.

06:20:41.818 --> 06:20:44.388
I HAVE BEEN TO MANY HOMELESS

06:20:44.454 --> 06:20:46.356
SHELTERS IN MY COMMUNITY MANY.

06:20:46.423 --> 06:20:51.328
MANY ENCAMPMENTS AND TALK TO

06:20:51.395 --> 06:20:51.962
FOLKS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING THIS

06:20:52.029 --> 06:20:54.164
CRISIS FIRSTHAND. TURN A BLIND

06:20:54.231 --> 06:20:57.167
EYE TO THEM. IS CRIMINAL. I

06:20:57.234 --> 06:20:57.734
RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE

06:20:57.801 --> 06:21:01.872
VOTE. THANK YOU MS WICKS MR

COLLEAGUES I APPRECIATE THAT

06:21:06.910 --> 06:21:07.844
DEBATE I APPRECIATE THE SHARING

06:21:07.911 --> 06:21:10.180
OF THE DIFFERENT. STORIES AND

06:21:10.247 --> 06:21:13.450
EXPERIENCES AND THE RECOGNITION

06:21:13.517 --> 06:21:15.252
OF THE CRITICAL IMPORT OF THIS

06:21:15.319 --> 06:21:16.987
MOMENT THIS THIS IS AN

06:21:17.054 --> 06:21:19.523
INFLECTION MOMENT THIS IS A

06:21:19.590 --> 06:21:20.757
TIME WHERE WE EITHER ACT WE DO

06:21:20.824 --> 06:21:23.293
NOTHING. AND I FIRMLY BELIEVE

06:21:23.360 --> 06:21:25.495
THAT WE MUST ACT AS A BODY FOR

06:21:25.562 --> 06:21:29.132
THE BENEFIT OF CALIFORNIA I

06:21:29.199 --> 06:21:29.666
WANT TO SHARE A COUPLE OF

06:21:29.733 --> 06:21:30.267
REFLECTIONS ON SOME OF THE OUR

06:21:30.334 --> 06:21:32.502
CONSENT WERE MADE. THERE WAS.

06:21:32.569 --> 06:21:33.837
BASED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THIS

06:21:33.904 --> 06:21:37.541
BILL ON SUPPLY ON BUILDING. AND

06:21:37.608 --> 06:21:38.442
THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING

06:21:38.508 --> 06:21:41.345
THAT'S NOT LOST. ON THE LEAD

06:21:41.411 --> 06:21:42.713
AUTHOR ON THE JOINT AUTHORS WE

06:21:42.779 --> 06:21:44.681
KNOW THAT THERE IS. A POTENTIAL

06:21:44.748 --> 06:21:46.817
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE AND IN

06:21:46.883 --> 06:21:48.418
ORDER TO ADDRESS THAT POTENTIAL

06:21:48.485 --> 06:21:50.554
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THE BILL

06:21:50.621 --> 06:21:52.189
DIRECTLY ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE

06:21:52.256 --> 06:21:54.324
BY EXEMPTING. NEW HOUSING FOR

06:21:54.391 --> 06:21:55.192
FIFTEEN YEARS SO THAT'S NOT

06:21:55.259 --> 06:21:57.394
SOMETHING THAT. SLIPPED BY US

06:21:57.461 --> 06:22:00.130
THAT WE DIDN'T WE WEREN'T AWARE

06:22:00.197 --> 06:22:00.731
OF WE WERE AWARE OF IT AND WE

06:22:00.797 --> 06:22:02.966
ADDRESS THAT. THIS BILL HAS

06:22:03.033 --> 06:22:05.435
ALSO BEEN CALLED. A RED CAP AND

06:22:05.502 --> 06:22:10.073
I THINK WORDS MATTER. AND. TO

06:22:10.140 --> 06:22:11.642
BE CLEAR UNDER THIS BILL RENT

06:22:11.708 --> 06:22:13.610
HIKES ARE NOT TO EXCEED 10% A

06:22:13.677 --> 06:22:16.647
YEAR WITH CPI PLUS 5% AS THE

06:22:16.713 --> 06:22:18.615
FORMULA THAT FORMULA ROWS OF

06:22:18.682 --> 06:22:20.183
ALLOWS RENTS THAT ARE TWICE AS

06:22:20.250 --> 06:22:21.151
HIGH AS THE CURRENT AVERAGE

06:22:21.218 --> 06:22:22.152
INCREASES ACCORDING TO THE

06:22:22.219 --> 06:22:23.553
BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS AND

06:22:23.620 --> 06:22:25.589
PREVENT ONLY THE EXTREME

06:22:25.656 --> 06:22:26.890
INCREASES THAT LEAD TO

06:22:26.957 --> 06:22:29.126
DISPLACEMENT SO THIS IS NOT

06:22:29.192 --> 06:22:30.827
RENT CONTROL THERE IS PLENTY OF

06:22:30.894 --> 06:22:33.163
ROOM FOR TURNING A PROFIT FOR.

06:22:33.230 --> 06:22:33.630
A REASONABLE RETURN ON

06:22:33.697 --> 06:22:35.365
INVESTMENT. DOES PROHIBIT

06:22:35.432 --> 06:22:38.101
SOMETHING WE CAN'T HAVE IN OUR

06:22:38.168 --> 06:22:39.036
SOCIETY DURING THE STATE OF

06:22:39.102 --> 06:22:39.536
CRISIS AND THAT IS RENT

06:22:39.603 --> 06:22:42.172
GOUGING. SO OUT WORDS MATTER

06:22:42.239 --> 06:22:44.708
THIS IS NOT RECONCILE THIS IS

06:22:44.775 --> 06:22:47.477
AN ANTI RENT GOUGING BILL. ALSO

06:22:47.544 --> 06:22:49.112
THE ISSUE OF COSTA HAWKINS IN

06:22:49.179 --> 06:22:50.013
VACANCY TO CONTROL THIS RACE SO

06:22:50.080 --> 06:22:52.249
LET'S BE CLEAR IN THIS REGARD.

06:22:52.316 --> 06:22:53.450
THE BILL LEAVES LEAVES COSTA

06:22:53.517 --> 06:22:55.285
HAWKINS AND FORCE. WHEN THE

06:22:55.352 --> 06:22:56.820
UNIT IS VACATED BY TENANT

06:22:56.887 --> 06:22:58.455
LANDLORD MAY CHOOSE TO RAISE

06:22:58.522 --> 06:22:59.656
THE RENT TO AN AMOUNT THAT THE

06:22:59.723 --> 06:23:02.125
MARKET WILL SUPPORT. THEY CAN

06:23:02.192 --> 06:23:03.760
SEE CONTROL REMAINS INTACT. WE

06:23:03.827 --> 06:23:07.397
ALSO HEARD DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW

06:23:07.464 --> 06:23:12.703
THIS IS A- EITHER OR FORK IN

06:23:12.769 --> 06:23:14.371
THE ROAD WHERE EITHER PROTECT

06:23:14.438 --> 06:23:14.971
TENANTS ARE WE GO WITH SUPPLY

06:23:15.038 --> 06:23:17.574
SIDE SOLUTIONS. AND I THINK

06:23:17.641 --> 06:23:17.974
THAT FUNDAMENTALLY

06:23:18.041 --> 06:23:20.711
MISUNDERSTANDS. THE OUR NEED TO

06:23:20.777 --> 06:23:23.180
ACT THE SCOPE OF OUR NEED TO

06:23:23.246 --> 06:23:23.747
ACT AND THE CHOICES THAT ARE

06:23:23.814 --> 06:23:26.983
BEFORE US. THOSE CHOICES ARE

06:23:27.050 --> 06:23:28.652
NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE IT IS

06:23:28.719 --> 06:23:31.321
NOT EITHER OR- IT IS BOTH WERE

06:23:31.388 --> 06:23:32.289
IN A STATE OF CRISIS WHEN THE

06:23:32.356 --> 06:23:33.423
STATE OF EMERGENCY MORE IN THAT

06:23:33.490 --> 06:23:34.791
STATE OF CRISIS AND EMERGENCY

06:23:34.858 --> 06:23:36.193
WE MUST USE ALL THE TOOLS IN

06:23:36.259 --> 06:23:37.327
THE TOOLBOX INTO EVERYTHING IN

06:23:37.394 --> 06:23:39.563
OUR POWER. TO IMPACT THE

06:23:39.629 --> 06:23:42.099
PROBLEM AND WE MUST TAKE ACTION.

06:23:42.165 --> 06:23:44.234
AND PROVIDE SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE

06:23:44.301 --> 06:23:46.603
THE IMPACT THAT MEETS THE SIZE

06:23:46.670 --> 06:23:47.337
AND SCOPE AND DEPTH OF THE

06:23:47.404 --> 06:23:48.572
PROBLEM THE PROBLEM YOU OF ALL

06:23:48.638 --> 06:23:49.840
DESCRIBE. THE SUFFERING THAT

06:23:49.906 --> 06:23:52.042
WERE SEEN. ACROSS CALIFORNIA SO

06:23:52.109 --> 06:23:53.844
IT'S A FALSE CHOICE WE CANNOT

06:23:53.910 --> 06:23:55.679
WE MUST DO BOTH. AND WE MUST TO

06:23:55.746 --> 06:24:00.083

AND WE WILL DO BOTH THE SESSION

06:24:01.852 --> 06:24:02.686
THERE ARE SUPPLY SIDE SOLUTIONS
