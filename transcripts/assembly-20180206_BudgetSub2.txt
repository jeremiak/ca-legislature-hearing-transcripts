FIRST THAT COMMITTEE OF THE NEW YEAR. AND YET COMMITTEE YEAH HIGHER. WE HAVE YOU HAVE A CASES OUR FIRST FOR. ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB TO THIS AT THIS OF COURSE IS A JOINT HEARING WITH THE ASSEMBLY HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE. ON EDUCATION FINANCE ON CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. IT CERTAINLY IMPORTANT TOPIC THAT WE HAD A HEARING ABOUT TWENTY SIXTEEN AND WANTED TO REVISIT THE ISSUE. TODAY WE ALSO MAY BE JOINED LATER BY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN WHO WHO'S CHAIRING THAT SIMPLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE MASTER PLANTS ARE REALLY WERE OFF ALL THREE OF US ARE LOOKING AT THIS THAT SAME ISSUE. AND YOU KNOW I THE ASSEMBLY HAS LONG CHAMPIONED INCREASING ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION AND IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS IN LARGE PART BECAUSE THE EFFORTS THAT WE PUSHED WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO. HAD ABOUT THIRTEEN THOUSAND MORE SLOTS IN THE UC SYSTEM. OVER FORTY THOUSAND ENROLLMENT SLOTS FOR CSU AND EARLY EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT SLOTS FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT PEACE BESIDES ALL THIS AND THAT. BOOMING ECONOMY IN THE INCREASED. BUDGET REVENUES WE KNOW THIS IS NOT ENOUGH. AND IT REALLY IS IS SOMEWHAT DAUNTING WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PP I SEE NUMBERS. AS WELL AS THE. CALIFORNIA COMPETES ANALYSIS WHICH SHOWS MANY NEW ANYWHERE BETWEEN ONE AND TWO MILLION MORE GRADUATES INDIVIDUALS WITH CERTIFICATES IN THE NEXT. THAT TEN FIFTEEN YEARS SO THESE ARE REALLY AMBITIOUS TARGETS. AND TO ACHIEVE THAT'S GONNA TAKE US SOME DRAMATIC. WORK IN A HERCULEAN EFFORT ON OUR PART TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT. BUT ALSO YOU KNOW THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX WHERE AS A HOW TO GET PEOPLE TO. GRADUATE A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME HOW CAN WE THINK ABOUT COLLEGE ANY MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE. A MANNER BUT TO DO THIS WE NEED A PLAN AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT HERE TODAY AND FOCUSING ON THE PLANET A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE. AND THE SEGMENTS BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE WE CAN'T PUT. YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF MONEY TO PUT THE TABLE. UNFORTUNATELY AND. WE ALSO KNOW THAT I KNOW THE SEGMENTS HAVE SOME IDEAS AND WE CAN BE WORKING ON THIS TOGETHER. HOW WE LOOK AT CERTAINLY I'M A CAPITAL OUTLAY ISSUES IN FACILITIES BUT ALSO ABOUT GRADUATION INITIATIVES THAT TECHNOLOGY ENABLE TOUCHING AS WELL? AND DEATH FOCUSING ON AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY THAT PUSHES FORWARD BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT. ARE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY NEEDS THIS MORE GRADUATES AND INDIVIDUALS IF THEY WANT TO HAVE A SUCCESSFUL. CAREER IN LIFE AND TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WE KNOW THAT HIGHER EDUCATION CERTAINLY IS THE TICKET SO THAT WE THAT WE HAVE A. UP PACKED AGENDA TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO BE OUR CONVERSATION TURNED OVER TO OUR WE KNOW THAT THE STATE IS FACING A SHORTFALL OF OVER ONE MILLION DEGREE HOLDERS. AND OVER TWO MILLION DEGREE AND SUB BACCALAUREATE HOLDERS. THESE NUMBERS ARE ALARMING WE MUST WORK TOGETHER IN ORDER TO FIND CREATIVE FEASIBLE AFFORDABLE. AND ACCESSIBLE WAYS OF ENSURING OUR CURRENT STUDENTS. AND FUTURE STUDENTS NOT ONLY IN ROLE IN OUR INSTITUTIONS BUT PERSIST IN ACHIEVING THEIR DEGREES. OF SUB OR SUB BACCALAUREATE DEGREES OR CERTIFICATIONS. THIS MORNING AS WE LISTEN TO THE SEGMENTS DISCUSS THEIR INNOVATIVE IDEAS. OF EXPANDING AXES AND COMPLETION. I AM EXCITED TO LEARN OF THEIR PROGRESS. AS MD RC SHARES WHAT HAS OR HAS OR HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OTHER STATES. AS THEY SEEK TO CLOSE THE DEGREE GAPS I AM HOPEFUL AND OPTIMISTIC THERE WILL BE SOME GREAT IDEAS. AND POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS THAT THE STATE MAY ALSO BE ABLE TO INCORPORATE. I LOOK FORWARD TO AN INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION. AND. LOOK TO THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE DYESS IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ANY OPENING COMMENTS. OKAY LICENSING NINE WILL GET ON WITH THE AGENDA THAT. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A AT STATE SAYS THAT ARE AT THE AT THE OUTSET THAT PP I SEE. AND CALIFORNIA COMPETES. TALK ABOUT THE. CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AND SOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR SUCCESS. AS WE HAVE HANS JOHNSON WITH PP I CITY. AND ONE DAY JOSE WITH CALIFORNIA COMPETES. I THINK YOU CHAIR I DON'T MCCARTY AND CHAIR MEDINAN% MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M HANS JOHNSON THE DIRECTOR OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION CENTER AT THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THIS MORNING I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN CLOSE THE DEGREE GAP IN CALIFORNIA I'M GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON. TARGETS AND NUMBERS BUT CERTAINLY BEHIND THOSE TARGETS IN NUMBERS ARE PROGRAMS AND PLANS AND INTERVENTIONS THEM AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STUDENTS WE'RE GOING ABOUT STUDENT SUCCESS. AND STUDENT SUCCESS THAT WILL LEAD TO A BETTER LIVES FOR STUDENTS IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC OUTCOMES BUT ALSO OTHER OUTCOMES LIKE SOCIAL HEALTH. AND WELFARE OUTCOMES AND A BETTER CALIFORNIA MORE TAX REVENUE AND LESS DEMAND FOR SOCIAL SERVICES. SO I HAVE. ASK THE SERGEANT AT ARMS TO GIVE YOU THIS HANDOUT. AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO FOLLOW ALONG AS I GO THROUGH MY TESTIMONY. TO THE FIRST SLIDE I HAVE. SHOWS WHAT PP I SEE HAS PROJECTED AND TERMS OF OUR DEGREE GAP. AND SPECIFICALLY THE ORANGE LINE SHOWS A BASELINE SOME ARE LESS THE ANNUAL NUMBER OF DEGREES THAT CALIFORNIA IS ON A PACE. TOOK A BUT BUT PRODUCE BASED ON CURRENT RATES OF COLLEGE GOING COLLEGE COMPLETION. AND. THOSE NUMBERS ARE ACTUALLY FOR ALL INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE STATE FROM. A PRIVATE NON PROFITS A PRIVATE FOR PROFIT STEVEN AND CERTAINLY UC AND CSU. THE DARKER LINE THERE THE GREENISH LINE IS WHAT IS OUR CLOSING THE GAP SCENARIO AND IF IF WE MEET THAT ARE SCENARIO. A WE WILL FULLY SATISFY THE NEEDS OF A WITH AN ECONOMY THAT IS INCREASINGLY DEMANDING MORE HIGHLY SKILLED AND HIGHLY EDUCATED WORKERS AND. MORE IN AN INCREASINGLY REWARDING THEM ECONOMICALLY. AND THE TOTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO LINES OVER THIS ENTIRE A TIME FRAME IS ABOUT ONE POINT ONE. MILLION DEGREES SO THAT'S THAT'S THE DEGREE GAP. SO LET'S TURN TO THE NEXT SLIDE THIS IS ON PAGE THREE OF YOUR HANDOUT. AND THE GOOD NEWS AND NOT SO GOOD NEWS MAYBE IT IS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A LOT OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT SO WHILE THOSE A DEGREE GOALS ARE AMBITIOUS. THERE ARE A LOT OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE. AND UNLIKE SOME OTHER STATES WHERE POPULATIONS ARE DECLINING. AND SOME COLLEGES ARE HAVING TROUBLES ENROLLING STUDENTS THAT TENDS NOT TO BE THE CASE IN CALIFORNIA AND CERTAINLY IS NOT THE CASE FOR OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. I SAW THIS CHART IS SHOWING YOU THIS PIPELINE FROM NINTH GRADE THROUGH TO A COLLEGE DEGREE AND SO OUT OF. ONE THOUSAND NINE GRADES IN CALIFORNIA YOU SEE HOW MANY WILL END UP GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL. AND THEN FINALLY AT THE FAR RIGHT IS HOW MANY WILL EVENTUALLY EARNED A BACHELOR'S DEGREE SO OUT OF THOSE ONE THOUSAND NINTH GRADERS. WE HAVE A LITTLE OVER THREE HUNDRED OF THEM WILL EVENTUALLY EARNED A BACHELOR'S DEGREES AT TODAY'S COLLEGE GOING ON COLLEGE COMPLETION RATES. THAT THE GOOD NEWS THAT AS WE HAVE A LOT OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. AND THE OTHER PIECE OF GOOD NEWS I WOULD SAY IS WE DO HAVE A LARGE NUMBER STUDENTS WHO DO MAKE THE TRANSITION FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO COLLEGE AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE WE HAVE. EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY THREE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES OUT OF THAT INITIAL ONE THOUSAND COHORT OF NINTH GRADERS. TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO WILL ATTEND A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS OF GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL. THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO WILL ATTEND A COMMUNITY COLLEGE SET ALTOGETHER THAT'S ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX OUT OF THAT EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE ARE GOING ON TO COLLEGE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM THERE. TO IMPROVE COLLEGE COMPLETION JUST AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY SUCCESSFULLY MADE THE TRANSITION TO COLLEGE. NOTABLY CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY SEVENTH IN THE NATION AND THE SHARE OF RECENT HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES TO GO TO A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY THAT'S THE TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO NUMBER. SO WERE DOWN NEAR THE BOTTOM AMONG ALL STATES THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT THERE. WE RANK FIFTH HIGHEST AMONG ALL STATES IN THE SHARE THAT GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOCUS. OUR IN OUR STATE WHICH IS PARTLY A RESULT OF OF THE MASTER PLAN AND AND OTHER ON DECISIONS WE'VE MADE AND DECISIONS MADE BY STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. GIVES US A TREMENDOUS POOL OF STUDENTS TO WORK WITH. I'D LIKE YOU DID ESPECIALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THAT THAT TRANSFER BOX THERE IT'S A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE OUT OF THAT INITIAL COHORT OF ONE THOUSAND NINTH GRADERS A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE OUT OF THE THREE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO TO TEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES. YOU CAN TELL I'M A DEMOGRAPHER LIKE THROWING OUT NUMBERS EARLY IN THE MORNING. BUT IN ANY EVENT THAT NUMBERS TO LAW ARE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES NO IT'S TOO LOW THEY HAVE A VERY AGGRESSIVE A VISION FOR SUCCESS WHICH WOULD DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THAT NUMBER AT THE GOALS TO INCREASE THAT NUMBER THIRTY FIVE PERCENT THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. IN TERMS OF NUMBER TRANSFER STUDENTS TO GO TO UC AND CSU. IF THEY DO THAT THAT WOULD PUT US AS A STATE AND THEM ON A SYSTEM YOU COMPLETELY. ARE ON PAR WITH WHAT WE HAVE RECOMMENDED IN TERMS OF CLOSING THE DEGREE GAP AND THEN FINALLY WE HAVE THIS TRANSITION THAN FROM. THOSE WHO MAKE IT TO A FOUR YEAR COLLEGE TO EARNING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND THERE AGAIN WE HAVE. CONTINUED TO DROP OFF SO THERE'S A LOT OF PARTS THIS PIPELINE WHERE THE INSTITUTIONS ARE WORKING TO IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES. AND WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BACHELOR'S DEGREES WE PRODUCE. IF YOU MOVE THEN TO SLIDE FOR WE HAVE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED A VERY AMBITIOUS GOALS FOR EACH OF THE SYSTEMS. ARE YOU SEE CSU PLAYS ARE THE LARGEST ROLE AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT IS BY FAR AND AWAY THE LARGEST. UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE STATE AND IN FACT THE LARGEST UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY. WITH. THE DISH NO DEGREES NECESSARY FOR THEM ANNOUNCING TOALMOST A HALF MILLION AND. JUST UNDER HALF THE TOTAL BUT OF COURSE YOU SEE AND A PRIVATE NON PROFITS PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE AS WELL. IF WE MOVE THEN TO SLIDE FIVE PP I SEE HAS IDENTIFIED SPECIFIC TARGETS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE IN THAT TO CLOSE THE DEGREE GAP. THESE ARE TARGETS IN TERMS OF THE STE ELIGIBILITY SHARES THAT THE SHERIFF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR YOU SEE OR CSU. AND YOU'LL SEE THAT OUR GOALS THAT ARE FOR YOU YOU SEE THE MOVE FROM TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT TO SEVENTEEN AND A HALF PERCENT. FOR CSU TO MOVE FROM THE TOP ONE THIRD OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES TO THE TOP FORTY PERCENT OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES WE HAVE FACED IN PERIODS FOR EACH ONE OF THESE TARGETS WHICH IS ON THE FAR RIGHT THERE. ARE THE. AGAIN SOME GOOD NEWS IS THAT CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES ARE INCREASINGLY MEETING THE A THROUGH G. CRITERIA THE COLLEGE PREPARATORY COURSES REQUIRED FOR ENTRANCE TO UC AND CSU. WE SEEN STRONG GAINS AMONG EVERY GROUP IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING LATINOS AND AFRICAN AMERICANS. AND IN FACT THE ELIGIBILITY STUDY THAT WAS. PRODUCED LAST YEAR SHOWED THAT SEE ISSUES ACTUALLY ADMIT. THAT THAT THAT FORTY PERCENT OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES A LITTLE OVER FORTY PERCENT HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES ARE ACTUALLY MEETING. THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA OF CSU RIGHT NOW SO IN A WAY WE'VE ALREADY MET THIS TARGET. YEARS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE BECAUSE STUDENTS ARE DOING SUCH A GOOD JOB IN TERMS OF. COMPLETING THOSE COURSES REQUIRED FOR CSU ELIGIBILITY AT THE GRADES REQUIRED BY CSU. I YOU SEE ARE ALSO IS ACTUALLY A SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THEIR TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT ACCORDING TO THAT SAME ELIGIBILITY STUDY. THAT WE ALSO THEN. FOCUS ON TRANSFER AND AS THEY SAID THIS IS INCREDIBLE AYE CREDIBLY IMPORTANT. MECHANISM FOR IMPROVING COLLEGE GRADUATION AND. AND YOU SEE. THEIR THESE NUMBERS REPRESENT THAT THIRTY FIVE PERCENT INCREASE THAT IS OF THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. A GOAL THAT OUR CHANCELLOR OAKLEY AND HIS TEAM HAVE IDENTIFIED. AND THEN FINALLY ON IMPROVING GRADUATION RATES OF STUDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY IN OUR FOUR YEAR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IS ESSENTIAL ANNUAL SEE. THERE WE SEE UC AND CSU ARE EIGHTY THREE AND FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT OF RESPECTIVELY WHEN WE DEVELOP THESE PROJECTIONS. THEIR LITTLE HIGHER NOW. AND THEN WE HAD OUR CLOSING THE GAP TARGETS FOR YOU SEE NINETY TWO PERCENT AND SEE IF YOU FOR SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT. ARE CSU TARGET IS IN FACT. EGGS A LITTLE LESS AMBITIOUS THAN BUT CSU HAS SAT OUR TARGETS OVER TWO THOUSAND THIRTY A CSU HOUSE A SEVENTY PERCENT GRADUATION RATE GOAL FOR THEIR SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE. BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE SO THAT'S ACTUALLY IF YOU IF YOU DRAW THE LINES THAT'S ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT MORE AMBITIOUS THAN WHAT WE'VE DONE SO WE'VE GOT SOME GOOD VISION WE'VE GOT SOME GOOD PLANS ARE ON THE PART OF THE SEGMENTS. IN TERMS OF TRYING TO IMPROVE GRADUATION RATES AND COMPLETION I KNOW WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM PRIVATE NON PROFITS LATER AND I THINK THEY'LL TALK ABOUT. A SOME OF THEIR GOALS WITH RESPECT TO ENROLLMENT INCREASES IN SERVING OUR STUDENTS SO THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD NEWS. OUT THERE. A I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND. JUST. VERY BRIEFLY MENTIONED THIS NEXT SLIDE SLIDE SIX WE BREAK OUT THESE THESE. TARGETS BECAUSE WE ASSUME MORE. AND IMPROVING GRADUATION RATES THAN THEY DO AND CSU THEIR THEIR. ACTUALLY A LITTLE HIGHER ENROLLMENT NUMBERS ARE A LITTLE HIGHER BECAUSE. I DON'T THEY HAVE A SLIGHTLY MORE AMBITIOUS GOALS WITH RESPECT GRADUATION RATES THAN OUR OUR TARGETS HAD SUGGESTED. THEN IF WE TURN TO SLIDE SEVEN OF THIS MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE A VERY IMPRESSIVE SLIGHT BUT THIS IS THE ONE THAT MAKES ME MOST HAPPY. WHAT WE HAVE HERE ARE THOSE INITIAL LINES YOU SAW BEFORE BUT THIS TIME BROKEN DOWN FOR THE TO PLOT LARGE PUBLIC SO THAT THE SECTORS YOU SEE ON THE LEFT IN CSU ON THE RIGHT? AND THAT NEW GRAY BAR WHICH I'VE ADDED IS WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENED SINCE WE DEVELOPED OUR PROJECTION SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND THE GOOD NEWS IS BOTH YOU SEE AND CSU ARE AHEAD OF. THE TARGETS THAT WE HAVE SAT AND THIS IS BECAUSE OF VERY SPECIFIC ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR IN TERMS OF PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING. FOR ENROLLMENT AND FOR STUDENT SUCCESS AND BY ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE INSTITUTIONS THEMSELVES TO ENROLL STUDENTS. AND INCREASE OUR COMPLETION AT PERSISTENCE COMPLETION AND EVENTUALLY GRADUATION RATES SO. CAN. THE GOOD NEWS IS WE'RE ON PACE. OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU LOOK ABOUT CHART YOU SEE WE'RE JUST AT THE BEGINNING AND WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK. TO GO. ALRIGHT AND THEN UP FINALLY. I'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT. AND VERY IMPORTANTLY THAT ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF CLOSING THE THE DEGREE GAP IS A TREMENDOUS IMPROVEMENT IN EQUITY. OUTCOMES IN CALIFORNIA OUR HIGH SCHOOLS ARE COMPRISED OF. EXCUSE ME ACT AND. ARE. COMPRISED OF A MAJORITY OF STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE OR REDUCED PRICE LUNCH. LATINOS ARE A MAJORITY OF STUDENTS AN ARCADE TWELVE SYSTEM. SO FOR CALIFORNIA TO REACH THESE GOALS MEANS THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE INCLUDING STUDENTS FROM GROUPS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN UNDERREPRESENTED IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE. ARE IN NUMBERS THAT WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND. FOR STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES ENSURING I THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY THAT HIGHER EDUCATION CONTINUES TO SERVE AS A LADDER OF ECONOMIC. AND SOCIAL MOBILITY AND DOES NOT SIMPLY. REINFORCE CLASS IN ECONOMIC DIVIDES THAT EXIST IN OUR COUNTRY AND WE HAVE A LOT OF GOOD. STORIES TO TELL A GOOD TRACK RECORD IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN MORE INCLUSIVE. THAN THOSE IN OTHER STATES INCLUDING OUR PUBLIC SYSTEMS AND CALIFORNIA. AND TO RISE TO THE CHALLENGE OF THE FUTURE WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT THAT CONTINUES TANKER. MEETING THESE GOALS WILL BE AYE COOPER INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT STEP IN MAKING SURE THAT HIGHER EDUCATION CONTINUES TO DO THAT FINALLY I SHOULD NOTE THAT OUR PROJECTIONS ARE FOCUSED ON BACCALAUREATE. UP PRODUCTION BUT. OTHERS HAVE LOOKED AT OUR CREDENTIALS IN POST SECONDARY BELOW BACKSPACE AGREES AS WELL AS WORK YOU'VE DONE ON BASHES GRACE THIS IS MONDAY DOESN'T IT GOING TO HEAR FROM AND AMEND IT. AND I SHOULD ALSO NOTE ARE THAT YOU SEE HAS RIGHTLY POINTED OUT THE IMPORTANCE OF GRADUATE STUDENTS IN THE ROLE OF THE GRADUATE STUDENTS PLAY IN OUR ECONOMY THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE PAST. LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES OF ANY GROUP. BUT ALSO. ARE INVOLVED IN TRADING FIRMS AND FINALLY ARE ALSO HELP EDUCATE UNDERGRADUATES THAT YOU SEE AS THE UC. OUR UNDERGRADUATE I CERTAINLY KNEW THAT WELL. AND IT'S A GRADUATE STUDENT YOU SEE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA COMPETES AND WE ARE AN INDEPENDENT NON PARTISAN PROJECT AIMED AT BOLSTERING THE STATE'S POST SECONDARY. AB. PUT SECONDARY OUTCOMES TO FOSTER A ROBUST ECONOMY VIBRANT COMMUNITY AND A VERY ENGAGED CITIZENRY. HOW MUCH ARE WORK FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON MAKING THE ECONOMIC AND EQUITY DRIVEN CASE FOR INCREASING DEGREE ATTAINMENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA? IN VERY MUCH BAKED INTO OUR VIEW OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE ECONOMIC MEETING THE ECONOMIC NEEDS OF THE STATE. WILL BRING ABOUT THE DESIRED AT NOT OUT COME OF HAVING MORE EQUITABLE OUTCOMES FOR THE STATE'S RESIDENTS. SO. WHAT I HAVE BEFORE YOU IS A POWER POINT ACCOMPANIED BY CAN A FORMAL REMARKS? MORE OR LESS EVERY PARAGRAPH EXPLAINS EVERY SLIDE BUT I DON'T WANNA GO THROUGH THAT WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO WITH KIND OF TALK WITH YOU CONCEPTUALLY ABOUT THE FOR BIG IDEAS. THAT WE THINK WILL COMPLEMENT THE WORK THAT OUR COLLEAGUES PP I SEE HAVE DONE IN TERMS OF THINKING THROUGH THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ELIGIBILITY POOLS AND ROMANCE TRANSFER AND COMPLETION. BECAUSE I THINK BY ITSELF THAT SERVES A VERY ROBUST MODEL FOR HOW THE STATE MIGHT APPROACH THINKING ABOUT SUPPORTING INCREASED DEGREE ATTAINMENT. BUT WE THINK THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF OTHER SUBTLETIES THAT OUGHT TO BE INCORPORATED INTO ANY MODEL IF YOU WELL AS WELL. BY WAY OF BACKGROUND AS YOU KNOW WE WERE ESTABLISHING AROUND TWENTY TEN TO IN RESPONSE TO A NATIONAL EFFORT TO INCREASE DEGREE ATTAINMENT. AND I WE'VE ALWAYS OPERATED FROM THE ASSUMPTION THAT IF CALIFORNIA WERE TO REACH FIFTY FIVE PERCENT DEGREE ATTAINMENT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. IT ACTUALLY PLACE THE STATE IN THE TOP TEN OF STATES. WITH EDUCATIONAL DEGREE ATTAINMENT. UP UNFORTUNATELY WERE NOT ON TRACK TO. GET TO THIS GOAL OUR ORIGINAL RESEARCH IN TWENTY TWELVE FOUND THAT WE WERE GONNA BE SHORT BY POINT ABOUT TWO POINT THREE MILLION DEGREES. AND OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE'VE UPDATED THAT NUMBER TWICE. AND THAT'S BASED ON THE STATE'S CHANGING POPULATION AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT AS HANS MENTIONED OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS HAVE ACTUALLY INCREASED THEIR OUT RATE OF COMPLETION FOR MANY ADULTS AND SO THAT. IS BEGINNING TO HELP US THINK ABOUT HOW WE CLOSE THAT GAP. AT THE SAME TIME DESPITE THEIR SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS WE STILL CONTINUE TO SEE A SIGNIFICANT GAP BETWEEN WHAT THE STATUS FORECAST PRODUCE AND WHAT IT ACTUALLY SHOULD PRODUCE IF WERE TO BE AWARE AMONGST ONE OF THOSE TOP TEN STATES. THE PROBLEM WE FACE IS THAT IS THAT WE CAN'T REALLY CLOSE THAT DEGREE OF PRODUCTION GAP. THE CURRENT PACE THAT WERE OUT ON BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. SO YOU KNOW EVERYONE NOW TALKS ABOUT WILL WE NEED TO STAY. AND STATE GOAL WOULD BE GREAT I END BUT TO BE CLEAR LIKE THE STATE GOAL AROUND TO GREET HIM AND IS NOT A BE ALL AND END ALL STRATEGY. AT I THINK IT'S AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT FOR HOW WE THINK ABOUT FURTHER PROMOTING COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION ACROSS AN INSTITUTIONAL SEGMENTS AND ALIGNED WITH. THE WORK THAT YOU ALL OF POLICYMAKERS DO BECAUSE IT REALLY HELPS TO COMMUNICATE A PUBLIC AGENDA FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND THAT IS IN FACT WHAT THE STATE SORELY NEEDS. LIKE MY COLLEAGUES AT PP I SEE WE THOUGHT ABOUT THE VARIOUS POLICY CONSIDERATIONS THAT WILL MOST MEANINGFULLY HELP TO ESTABLISH. DEGREE ITAIM INCREASE TO GREET HIM AND REACH A GOAL AND WE AGREE THAT PAYING ATTENTION TO ENROLLMENT ON TRANSFERS IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THAT BUT WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU THINK ABOUT EXPANDING THE MODEL. TO DEVELOP DEGREE GOALS THAT INCLUDE NOT ONLY IN PUTS. BUT ALSO FOCUSED ON THE OUTPUTS THAT LEADS EQUITABLE OUTCOMES AND SERVE THE STATE'S ECONOMIES. DEGREE COMPLETION IS THE MOST OBVIOUS OUTPUT TO CONSIDER BUT ARTICULATING A SET A GOAL CENTERED ON DEGREE COMPLETION REQUIRES PAYING ATTENTION TO MORE THAN JUST THE TOTAL NUMBER. IT OUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT WHO THOSE DEGREES GO TO WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED AND HOW THEY SUPPORT OUR REGIONAL ECONOMIES. CONCEPTUALLY WE THINK THEREFORE CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS TO ESTABLISHING MEANINGFUL RESPONSE OF GOALS. FIRST DEPICTED REPRODUCTION OUGHT TO ALIGN WITH GROWING OCCUPATIONAL DEMANDS. THE LARGEST OCCUPATIONS THAT REQUIRE DEGREE BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE ENCOMPASS A WIDELY DIVERSE SPECTRUM. BY THAT TIME THE STATE WILL NEED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TEACHERS STEM PROFESSIONALS FINANCE EXPERTS THE LIST GOES ON. CLOSING THE GAP BY PRODUCING DEGREES IN ONLY ONE OR A FEW OF THESE FIELDS WOULD BE A FAILURE FOR THE STATE. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE THE CAPACITY CAPITAL AND THE INCENTIVES IN PLACE. TO SUPPORT INSTITUTIONS IN PRODUCING DEGREES BUT OFFERED THEM BEST LONG TERM OPPORTUNITY TO STUDENTS AND RESPOND TO THE CHANGING NEEDS OF OUR ECONOMY. THIS REQUIRES THAT THE MODEL THAT YOU ALL THINK ABOUT. ITS. BE USED TO ESTABLISH GOALS THAT ARE ATTUNED TO THE DIVERSE MISSIONS AND CAPACITIES OF OUR INSTITUTIONAL SEGMENTS. SECOND DEGREE GOALS MUST BE RESPONSIVE TO VARIATIONS EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO A RICH DIVERSITY OF CULTURES AND BUSINESS COMMUNITIES THAT AFFORD SOME OF THE MOST THRIVING LOCAL ECONOMIES. IN THE WORLD. INCREASINGLY STATEWIDE DEGREE ATTAINMENT IS A NET WHEN HOWEVER. REALISTIC GOALS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS SHOULD BE CUSTOMIZED TO ACCOUNT FOR REGIONAL DIFFERENCES. AN EQUITABLE APPROACH TO INCREASING DEGREE PRODUCTION ACROSS THE STATE. WOULD UP DEVELOP A MODEL THAT CONSIDERS REGIONAL CONTACTS. THIRD WE MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT REGIONAL DIFFERENCE IN WORKFORCE NEEDS AND LOCAL INSTITUTIONS ABILITY TO RESPOND TO THOSE NEEDS ARE ALSO A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF THE ISSUE. WERE NOT ADVOCATING FOR AN EXPLICIT EDUCATION TO EMPLOYMENT MAPPING OR USING LABOR FORCE PREDICTIONS TO NARROWLY PRESCRIBED WHAT DEGREES ARE OFFERED IN EACH REGION. HOWEVER THE MAJORITY OF U. S. COLLEGE STUDENTS ATTEND SCHOOL WITHIN FIFTY MILES OF THEIR HOME AND ITS NECESSARY THAT STUDENTS WHO GRADUATE WITH A DEGREE. HAVE A FAIR OPPORTUNITY FOR LONG TERM QUALITY EMPLOYMENT AND THAT EMPLOYERS IN THE REGION HAVE ACCESS COMPETENTLY SKILLED WORKERS. A PRUDENT WAY TO INCORPORATE THIS INTO IT DEGREE ATTAINMENT GOAL WOULD BE TO DEVELOP A MODEL THAT INCORPORATES JOB PLACEMENT RATES. THE PATIENT PLACEMENT RATES AND TIME TO EMPLOYMENT RATES FOR GRADUATES. FINALLY THIS REGIONAL LIVE METHODOLOGY CAN AND SHOULD BE APPLIED TO VARIATION IN EDUCATIONAL TEN ATTAINMENT BY RACE AND GENDER. TO DEMONSTRATE THIS WE ANALYZED ATTAINMENT DATA BY RACE AND GENDER AND ONE OF OUR FAVORITE REGIONS THE INLAND EMPIRE. ALARMINGLY LATINOS WHO MAKE UP ABOUT HALF OF THE TOTAL POPULATION IN THIS REGION HAVE DRAMATICALLY LOWER RATES OF DEGREE COMPLETION COMPLETION COMPARED TO OTHER GROUPS. THIS IS NO MATHEMATICALLY THERE'S NO MATHEMATICALLY VIABLE PATH FORWARD TO INCREASE REGIONAL DEGREE PRODUCTION WITHOUT ADDRESSING THE INEQUITIES OF COMPLETION GAPS. SPLAYED ACROSS DIFFERENT POPULATIONS. TO REACH A RACIALLY EQUITABLE EDUCATION EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. GOAL SHOULD BE CONTEXTUALIZED TO COUNT FOR THE PROGRESS MADE TOWARDS ELIMINATING ENROLLMENT AND COMPLETION DISPARITIES. IF YOU CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT DEGREE ATTAINMENT GOALS WE HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER NOT JUST HOW MANY DEGREES OUR STATE NEEDS BUT WHAT MAJORS AND WHAT DEGREES ARE NEEDED. TO FUEL THE REGIONAL ECONOMIES AND HOW WE OUGHT TO PRIORITIZE THOSE. HIGHEST EDUCATIONAL NEED. WE A CALIFORNIA COMPETES ARE QUITE EAGER TO SUPPORT YOU IN YOUR EFFORTS TO INCREASE STATEWIDE DEGREE PRODUCTION THROUGH COMPLETION. AND WE OFFER OUR EXPERTISE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO REFINE THE STRATEGY THAT EQUITABLY EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. OKAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS TO HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. FROM HIS FIRST. PANEL. YES FAMILY MEMBER BAKER THANK YOU AND I DID SNEAK IN MIDWAY THROUGH BUT THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND TO FURTHER THE HEARING IN THE TOPIC. I'M LIKE TO GO BACK TO. IT'S A GOOD OBSERVATION IS BEING MADE IS THAT THE REGIONALISM THAT WE NEED TO BE CONSIDERING. HOW? HOW MUCH? CAN WE BE LOOKING ALSO AT HOW NIMBLE WE NEED TO BE AS THAT CHANGES. FOR EXAMPLE IF WE'RE GOING TO SAY THE INLAND EMPIRE IS GONNA HAVE A LOT OF NEEDS FOR NURSES. OR PEOPLE WITH NURSING DEGREES OR SOME SORT OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE DEGREE. AND POPULATIONS CHANGE THEY MOVE AND YOU WANT PEOPLE TO BE AS MOBILE AS POSSIBLE. AND AS YOU'RE LOOKING AT THESE NUMBERS. HOW HOW MUCH RECONSIDERING MOBILITY AND THE PEOPLE UP AND MOVE AND? SPLIT AFTER THEY GET A DEGREE THEY DON'T NECESSARILY STAY RIGHT WHERE THEY'RE AT. SO WE WANT TO HAVE A DEGREE THAT'S PORTABLE WE ONE HAVE THE SKILLS OR PORTABLE TO GO WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO GO BUT. I'M CAN YOU COMMENT AT ALL ON THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW REGIONALISM NOW I MEAN I THINK THE REGIONALISM QUESTION IS IS AN IMPORTANT ONE BECAUSE CERTAINLY YOU DON'T WANT TO. OVERLY TYPE PRESCRIBE PEOPLE'S OPPORTUNITY STRUCTURE RIGHT SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET YOUR DEGREE AND TAKE IT WHERE EVER YOU WOULD LIKE TO GO. THE SAME TIME I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE SUCH ON EVEN. THEY'RE SUCH GREAT REGIONAL DISPARITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY OBVIOUSLY COMPARED TO. HOLLYWOOD INLAND EMPIRE ARE ABOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY THEIR REAL DISPARITIES IN TERMS OF THE OPPORTUNITY STRUCTURE THERE AND I THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE WITH THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THOSE REGIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AS. OUR BEST LABOR MARKET DATA COMES AS CLOSE TO TO THE YEAR WERE STUDENTS ARE GRADUATING WHICH DOESN'T REALLY GIVE OUR INSTITUTIONS THE TIME THAT THEY NEED. TO RE CALIBRATE AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T WAIT UNTIL. NOW TO TO GET YOU KNOW FIVE HUNDRED MORE NURSES FOR SEPTEMBER SO THERE IS A TENSION THERE BETWEEN HOW WE THINK ABOUT WHAT THE REGIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ARE CURRENTLY. AND HOW WE NEED TO. ADJUST AND FLEX OUR INSTITUTIONAL AND INSTITUTIONS BE ABLE TO CREATE THE KINDS OF OCCUPATIONS THAT THAT ARE NEEDED. AND THE THIS MAYBE FOR MISTER JOHNSON HAD JUST SORT OF LOOKING AT THE. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE HERE ABOUT THE DEGREE GAP. AND WHERE WE DEFINING IS A DEGREE. BECAUSE WHEN I VISIT WITH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. THAT WE'RE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUES THAT THEY MENTION IS JUST SOMEONE WHO HAS THE SKILLS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE FOR YOUR DEGREE. AND I'M A VERY BIG PROPONENT OF FOR YOUR DEGREE BUT I'M IS ARE WE LOOKING AT MANY OF THE TRADE. OPPORTUNITIES THAT FOR WHICH WE CAN HAVE CERTIFICATIONS ARE DEGREES ARE DIFFERENT PATHS. IS THAT INCLUDED IN THIS. ANALYSIS OF THEIRS OF HOW. BROUGHT THE GAP IS BETWEEN THE DEGREES WE NEED BECAUSE THIS LOOKS MOSTLY LIKE NEED FOR YOUR DEGREE SO SO RIGHT SO SO WE FOCUSED OUR IN THIS AREN'T. WORK ARE ON FOUR YEAR DEGREES BASHERS GREASE FOR A COUPLE REASONS FIRST THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA PARENTS WANT THEIR CHILD TO EARN AT LEAST ABOUT FIRST DEGREE. AND A FACT IN OUR LATEST SURVEY A MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA PARENTS WANT THEIR CHILD TO ACTUALLY EARN A GRADUATE DEGREE. THE DEMAND IS VERY HIGH STUDENTS. ARE INCREASINGLY RESPONDING TO THE NEEDS A IN TERMS OF A COLLEGE PREPARATORY REQUIREMENTS. AND RESPONDING FINALLY TO TO THE CONNIE WHICH CONTINUES TO DESPITE WHAT YOU MIGHT HAVE READ. REWARD COLLEGE GRADUATES WHAT THE BASHERS AGREE MORE THAN ANY OTHER. MOSTLY MORE THAN LESS EDUCATED INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING ARE THOSE WHO HAVE SOME COLLEGE OR THOSE WHO HAVE CERTIFICATES ON AVERAGE NOW. LET ME UNPACK THAT LITTLE BIT. I WE'VE DONE WORK IN MONDAY'S DONE WORK ALSO SO LONG THEY MIGHT WANT TO ADD TO THIS BECAUSE LANDET HOUSE DEVELOP PROJECTION SIMILAR TO OURS EXCEPT HERS ARE. BUT SHE'S ALSO ADDED CERTIFICATES TOOK TO THE NUMBER. ARM AND IT'S ROUGHLY DOUBLES BUT THE NUMBER BUT THAT THAT WE HAVE THE ONE POINT ONE MILLION BECOMES TWO POINT THREE SOMETHING LIKE WHAT FOR HALF A POINT FOR. AS A WE DON'T MARKET PP I SEE LOOKING UP HIGH VALUE CERTIFICATES PURSES MAYBE NOT SO HIGH VALUE CERTIFICATES WE STARTED OUT WORK LOOKING AT HEALTH AND OBVIOUSLY THE MOST HIGH VALUE CERTIFICATE YOU CAN EARN AND HEALTH IS ACTUALLY CALL VOCATIONAL DEGREE IS AN ASSOCIATES DEGREE IN NURSING. MEDICAL ASSISTING DOESN'T GET YOU MUCH ANNA IN THE LABOR MARKET AYE IT DOES ALLOW YOU THOUGH VERY IMPORTANTLY. TO MOVE ARE OUT OF INDUSTRIES WHERE MAYBE THERE ISN'T A LOT OF UPSIDE POTENTIAL RETELL FOR EXAMPLE TO HEALTH WHERE THERE IS A LOT MORE UPSIDE POTENTIAL AND ONE OF THE PIECES THAT WE'VE DONE LOOKING AT CERTIFICATES. AND OF FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN A MEDICAL ASSISTING DEGREE FOR EXAMPLE IS THAT A NUMBER OF THOSE ARE PEOPLE WHO EARNED THOSE DEGREES WILL GO ON AND EARN HIGHER DEGREES AND CERTIFICATES AND HEALTH. I SOMETIMES INCLUDING ALL THE WAY UP TO REGISTERED NURSE SO THAT'S. STEPWISE OF BUILDING OF DEGREES I'D CERTIFICATES IS A STRATEGY THAT STUDENTS ARE EMPLOYING COLLEGES ARE INCREASINGLY IDENTIFYING AS A WAY TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS WHO MIGHT BE EARNING.CERTIFICATES THAT ARE RELATIVELY LOW INCOME OUR LOW OF LOW VALUE AT THE START HAVING SAID THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF STUDENTS WHO ARE THE MEDICAL SYSTEM GREEN NEVER COME BACK AND DON'T EARN. A HIGHER VALUE CERTIFICATES THAT'S ANOTHER CHALLENGE BUT I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM IN OUR ECONOMY FOR POST SECONDARY AWARD SHORT OF THE VOUCHERS DEGREE. AND AGAIN LINE BASED ON SOME WORK AND WE'RE DOING SOME WORK ON THAT BUT PLEASE DO NOT. DISMISS THE TREMENDOUS IMPORTANCE OF THE BACHELORS DEGREE IN TERMS OF SOMEONE'S LIFE AND LIVELIHOOD BY HONEST WITH YOU. HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN. OF MY OWN AYE I WON'T LAST LAST MINUTE TO DO WITH THAT WHAT ROLE YOU SEE THE NEED FOR REMEDIATION OR MEDIA WHAT WE'VE BEEN CALLING REMEDIAL. EDUCATION WHEN SOMEONE IS STARTING OFF AT POST HIGH SCHOOL. IN AND COMPLICATING THE IT'S THE DEGREE GAP AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME MOVEMENT IN POLICIES WITH SOME OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS ON THAT. WE'RE GONNA NEED TO WORK ON THAT BUT I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOUR OPINION ON HOW MUCH THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DEGREE GAP SO WE'VE GOT A LOT OF WORK LOOKING AT REMEDIATION IN CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ARE ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF ENTERING COHORTS IN THE PAST WERE IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING REMEDIATION. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE STUDENTS NEVER EARNED A CERTIFICATE OR TRANSFER OR AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE. AND IN FACT A MAJORITY OF THEM NEVER PASS. COLLEGE LEVEL ENGLISH OR MATH COURSE. WE'VE LOOKED AT REFORMS IN ENGLISH AND MATH OR ENGLISH OF REFORM WORK IS GOING TO BE PRESENTED ON FEBRUARY TWENTY EIGHTH HERE IN SACRAMENTO. OUR AND OUR MOUTH REFORM WORK SHOWED THAT ACCELERATED PATHWAYS FOR STUDENTS SERVE THEM MUCH BETTER COMBINING FOR EXAMPLE TO REMEDIATION COURSES. INTO ONE BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY WAS ARE THE STATISTICS PATHWAY. AYE IN MOUTH VERSUS A TRADITIONAL MOUTH PATHWAY LED TO MUCH MUCH BETTER OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS INCLUDING MORE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF SUBSEQUENT COLLEGE LEVEL COURSES AND MARK. TRANSFER LATER ON. HAVING SAID ALL THAT MEANWHILE YOU OF THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR HAVE PASSED BILLS THAT WILL DRAMATICALLY REFORM. HOW REMEDIATION TAKES PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND I KNOW WE HAVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE PEOPLE HERE WHO CAN TALK ABOUT THAT FURTHER? BUT THAT WORK WILL LEAD TO ACHIEVE AT VERY LARGE SHIFT ALREADY SEEN THIS HAPPENING AT SOME OF THE COLLEGES THAT A BENEFIT FOR FRONT OF THESE STRANGERS. LOOKING AT HIGH SCHOOL GRADES AND COURSES AS THE PRIMARY WAY TO PLACE STUDENTS WHICH. IS THE BEST PREDICTOR OF HOW SOON WILL DO IN COLLEGE NOT HOW THEY DO ON A SINGLE PLACEMENT EXAM. AND THAT WORK SHOWS THAT THOSE STUDENTS ABOUT STUDENTS NOW ARE INCREASINGLY. BEING PLACED DIRECTLY INTO COLLEGE LEVEL WORK NOT EVEN BEING HAVE NOT EVEN HAVING TO REMEDIATE AT ALL AND OF COURSE SUCCESS RATES ARE GOING UP TREMENDOUSLY THROUGH BUT. I EXPECT WILL GO UP QUITE A BIT WHICH CREATES A CHALLENGE FOR ALL OF US THEY CAN DOWN THE LINE HOW DO WE ACCOMMODATE. WHAT I I WOULD CALL THE WAVE AND MAYBE THE TIDAL WAVE OF? TRANSFER ELIGIBLE STUDENTS AS THESE REFORMS ARE IMPLEMENTED AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOREST PLACE AT UC CSU ARE PRIVATE NONPROFIT. AND RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HANDLE ABOUT FLOW AND SO I THINK THAT'S A TREMENDOUS CHALLENGE GOING FORWARD NINE WERE VERY EXCITED INSTITUTIONALLY. ABOUT THE REFORMS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE AND AND WE THINK THEY'RE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND AND THE LEGISLATURE. AS WELL AS THE COLLEGES SHOULD PAT THEMSELVES ON THE BACK FOR MAKING THOSE REFORMS THANK YOU VERY HELPFUL THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER QUIRK SILVA. YES THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WITH YOUR PRESENTATION IN RESEARCH I'VE. I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS BUT ONE ON A TRANSFER DEGREE WE'VE SEEN THAT. OVER THE YEARS ON THAT THIS GROUP I AS FAR AS THE CAL STATES OF CAL STATE FULLERTON IN MY DISTRICT THE ON THE LARGEST ONE. OF THE CS USE AND THEY ARE MAKING INCREASES IN THEIR TRANSFER PROGRAM AND YET. IT'S STILL NOT WHERE WE WANT IT SO WE HAVE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW DO YOU GET INTO THE NEXT STEP IF THEY ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW DO ATTAIN SOME TYPE OF DEGREE WE DO HAVE THE TRANSFER PROGRAM THING AND YET I'VE HEARD THAT. ANYTIME STUDENTS DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT AND IF THEY DO KNOW ABOUT IT SAVE RT STARTED TAKING COURSEWORK SO THEY CAN'T REALLY FIT INTO THAT. TRANSFER DEGREE PROGRAMS SO IF YOU CAN JUST SPEAK IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ON. IS THAT WORKING IS IT. WHAT CAN WE DO TO GET THOSE STUDENTS TEND TO LOOK INTO THAT TRANSFER PROGRAM? SO THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR FAST PROGRAM IS A GREAT IDEA AYE AND IT'S DESIGNED TO TRY TO SOLVE ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS. WE HAVE WHICH IS. ELIMINATING BARRIERS TO MOVING FROM COMMITTEE ECOLOGIST FOR YOUR CALLER ISN'T SUPPOSED TO MAP OUT FIRST TUNE AND GUARANTEE A STUDENT. A SPOT AT A CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS ARE IN A MAJOR IF IT IS. HAS HAS DEVELOPED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. SO I'M A BIG FAN BUT IT'S IT'S JUST A STOP AND I WOULD SAY ALMOST A BABY STEP IN AYE DIRECTION FOR THE REASONS THAT YOU'VE JUST IDENTIFIED A LOT OF STUDENTS DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT. AND ALSO THE AGREEMENTS ARE BETWEEN. COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND SEE ISSUE CAMPUSES YOU SEE IS NOT A PART OF OF THE AGREEMENT AND THEN FINALLY IT'S NOT SYSTEM WIDE. SO ARE A LOT OF CAN YOU COLLEGE STUDENTS MIGHT THINK WELL I'M NOT SURE I MIGHT WANT TO GO TO YOU SEE I MIGHT WANT TO GO TO A CSU. AND SO THAT DOESN'T REALLY WORK IF YOU GET AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER THAT ONLY GOES TO ONCE YES YOU MAYBE WANT TO GO TO DIFFERENT CSU. AND THEN FINALLY SO HAVING MORE SYSTEM WIDE COHERENCE AND AGREEMENT I THINK WOULD MAKE SENSE AND. WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM NDRC ABOUT PRACTICES AND OTHER STATES SO I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS PART OF THAT TESTIMONY BUT SOME OTHER STATES HAVE MUCH MORE UNIFORM. LOWER DIVISION REQUIREMENTS IN THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT CLEARLY FEED TOO. THEIR FOUR YEAR COLLEGES AND AND AND UNIVERSITIES FINAL NOTE THAT. THEY TOO MANY COLLEGES ARE IMPLEMENTING THIS NEW GUIDED PATHWAYS INITIATIVE WHICH IS DESIGNED TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS YOU MENTIONED WERE STUDENTS TO START TAKING COURSES AND THEN THEY. MAYBE LATER SIGNED UP FOR THE EIGHTY TWO YEAR THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT WHEN THEY FIRST GOT THERE AND THE GUIDED PATHWAYS INITIATIVE IS SUPPOSED TO GET STUDENTS RIGHT WHEN THEY COME IN. AND HELP THEM HAVE A GUIDED PATHWAYS MEANING YOU KNOW VERY CLEAR UNDERSTANDING WHAT COURSES THEY NEED TO TAKE WHEN. AND MAKING SURE THOSE COURSES ARE AVAILABLE. WHEN THOSE STUDENTS WANT TO I NEED TO TAKE THEM SO THAT THEY CAN COMPLETE ON A MORE TIMELY BASIS AND ON THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AGAIN HAVE FUNDED. ABOUT PROGRAM JUST ONE NOTE I WOULD AGREE WITH HAUNTED IT'S NOT SYSTEM WIDE AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IT'S NOT SYSTEM WIDE. BOTH BY INSTITUTION AND ALSO BY. DUBBED BY MAJOR SO SOME INSTITUTIONS MIGHT HAVE THE THIRTY THREE FOR TRANSFERRING THE PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT OTHERS WANT SO THAT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT REALLY AN EQUITABLE CHOICE FOR ALL STUDENTS ACROSS. SO LET ME ASK OUR CHAIRS REALLY QUICKLY IS IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY OF AT LEAST GETTING IT THE CURRENT INFORMATION WITH WHAT WE WILL HAVE TO SAY BY THIS SPRING. TO HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES SAY THEIR LAST SEMESTER UP BECAUSE THE STUDENTS WHO HAVE ALREADY MADE THAT THE. STEP TO GO TO A FOUR YEAR THEY'VE ALREADY. DONE THE APPLICATIONS WHETHER IT'S YOU SEE YOUR CAL STATE BUT THE STUDENTS ARE GOING TO GO TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE. MAY BE I. TRYING TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND IF THEY DO OVER THE SUMMER DECIDE I'M GONNA GO TO JUST SAY FULLERTON COLLEGE THEY STILL MIGHT NOT KNOW ABOUT THE TRANSFER DEGREE. OF OR ANY OF THESE PATHWAYS AND NOWADAYS A LOT OF STUDENTS DON'T GET TO THE CAMPUS AND OTHER VERY FIRST DAY OF CLASSES. BECAUSE THEY CAN DO ALL OF THIS ONLINE SO IS THERE ANY WAY FOR US TO HAVE. TO DO TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THIS INFORMATION TO HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS. I HATE USING THE WORD AND ALL OF THEM OR NOT BEEN MAKING IT AVAILABLE BUT I REALLY DO THINK IF WE HAD JUST A. VERY SIMPLE ONE PAGE INFORMATION ABOUT PATHWAYS IN THE TRANSFER BEFORE THEY EVEN GET TO SIGNING UP THEY'D AT LEAST KNOW THAT THAT'S AVAILABLE. NO I IF I COULD ANSWER. I REMEMBER AS A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER OF WHEN THE CSU SYSTEM WAS GIVING. THE ASSESSMENT TEST. TWO I SCHOOL SENIORS AS PART OF THEIR OTHER TESTING. AND AND THAT WAS WORK DENSE SO THAT STUDENTS ALL SENIORS WHO WERE TAKING THE. I FORGET WHICH ASSESSMENT TESTS WERE ABLE TO TAKE THE CSU ASSESSMENT TESTS AS THE UP AS PART OF THAT I THOUGHT THAT WAS HELPFUL. AND SO CERTAINLY MISS QUIRK SILVA I THINK THAT BOTH CSU AND YOU SEE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND A WAY. TO GET THAT INFORMATION TO US. ALL HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS BEFORE THEY GRADUATE AND WE CAN WORK WITH THEM ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK ANY WE ALWAYS TALK BIG GLOBAL KIND OF CHANGES BUT THIS CAN BE VERY SIMPLE. WHERE AGAIN FOR THAT GROUP OF STUDENTS WHO IS NOT SURE WHAT THEY'RE DOING NEXT BUT MIGHT CHOOSE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CUT THAT THEY KNOW BEFORE THEY EVEN LOOK AT THE OFFERED? TO AN EIGHTIES ARE THERE THAT THE COURSEWORK THAT HEY IF I CHOOSE THIS TRANSFER EVEN IF IT MAY NOT BE ALL OVER AT LEAST THEY HAVE A PATHWAY INTO THE FOUR YEAR. BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE SEEN MANY MANY STUDENTS I WOULD SAY MORE MALES THAN FEMALES. SPENDING FIVE AND SIX YEARS AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE A LOT OF IT IS THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO DO BUT A LOT OF IT IS THEY START TAKING COURSEWORK. THAN THEY REALIZE ALL I DON'T REALLY NEED THAT THEY MIGHT SEE A COUNSELOR COULD BE A YEAR INTO THEIR EYES THEY DROP CLASSES AND WE'RE JUST SEEING THAT THAT STUDENT SUCCESS WHERE. THEY WANT TO BE THERE MAY BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS ARE TELLING THEM BUT THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT TO DO AND AND IT'S TAKING THEM A LONG TIME IF THEY EVER TRANSFER. THANK YOU. BUT YOUR QUESTION YOU CAN. I HAD TWO QUESTIONS. RANDY I THINK YOU MENTIONED YOU'VE MADE THE STATEMENT A A LACK OF THE PUBLIC AGENDA FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. AND. ONE OF THINGS THAT HAS STRUCK ME MOST. AS CHAIR OF HIGHER EDUCATION. IN MY SEVERAL YEARS NOW SERVING AS THE CHAIR UMPIRE EDUCATION IS THAT WE DO NOT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ANYMORE. HAVE AN OVERRIDING A UMBRELLA GROUP. WHOSE MISSION I WOULD THINK WOULD BE TO SET THAT AGENDA TO SEE HOW THE DIFFERENT SEGMENTS WORK TOGETHER. SO I MAKE REFERENCE TO. WHEN WE GOT RID OF SEPAK. I'D THE POST CALIFORNIA PUT SECONDARY EDUCATION COMMISSION BEFORE WE GOT HERE YES AND THERE HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT. ATTEMPTS BY THE LEGISLATURE BOTH IN THE SENATE. A TO TRY TO CREATE SUCH AN ENTITY. SO THAT STRIKES ME. VERY MUCH THAT WE DO NOT HAVE SUCH AN ENTITY ANYMORE AND SO THEREFORE WHERE WITH THE AGENDA COME FROM. ALSO WITH THAT. THE ABSENCE OF A STATE COORDINATING BODY FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. ALSO CONCERNS EXISTS BUT THE STATE STILL HAS LIMITED DATA CAPACITY. WHICH COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ASSESS DEGREE AND PAYMENT INPUTS AND OUTPUTS SO MY QUESTION. IS DO YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS ON WAYS THAT THIS CAN BE ADDRESSED. THANK YOU. WE ARE VERY VERY STRONG SUPPORTERS OF THE STATE. HAVING A NEW BETTER VERSION OF WHAT WAS THAT CALIFORNIA POST SECONDARY EDUCATION COMMISSION. THAT ENTITY REALLY. IS A SIGNIFICANT INSOFAR AS IT DOES HAVE THE ABILITY IF CONSTRUCTED PROPERLY TO BE ABLE TO SET A PUBLIC AGENDA FOR HIGHER EDUCATION ONE THAT WOULD BE INFORMED BY CERTAINLY. THE VIEWS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION BUT ALSO ONE THAT REALLY IS LOOKING OUT ACROSS ALL OF OUR HIGHER EDUCATION. SEGMENTS TO UNDERSTAND HOW FAR ARE WE GETTING ON THIS DEGREE ATTAINMENT GAP AT WHAT RATE WHAT KINDS OF POLICIES COULD BE IN PLACE WHAT THE CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS WE FACE HOW WOULD YOU SOLVE FOR THOSE WHERE THE CAPITAL NEEDS OF OUR INSTITUTIONS. WE ACTUALLY THE STATE HAS NO FUNCTION FOR FIGURING OUT ANY OF THAT. I KNOW MISTER BERMAN IS HAVING HIS HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE MASTER PLAN AND THE MASTER PLAN ORIGINALLY DESIGNED. THAT THE SEAT SEE PACKETS THAT AS IT EXISTED BUT OVER TIME SEE PACK. A ROAD FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REASONS AND NOW WE ACTUALLY FROM THE HAVE INSTITUTIONS THAT I THINK ARE DOING THEIR BEST BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW THAT ACTUALLY RELATE TO THE STATES GOALS BOMB RELATIVE TO THE INCREDIBLE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT MAYBE NOT AS MUCH AS WE MIGHT LIKE. TO SEE BUT THEY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT THAT THE STATE MAKES AND HIGHER EDUCATION AND ALSO RELATES TO THE SIZE AND SCOPE AND SCALE AND DIVERSITY OF OUR POPULATION AND WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO BOTH SUPPORT THOSE STUDENTS. AND MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WHAT THOSE STUDENTS ARE DOING AND OUR BROADER ECONOMY A ONE THINKS HE PACKED INTO WAS TO THINK ABOUT ECONOMIC CONCERNS AT ALL IT WAS VERY JUST SINGULARLY FOCUSED ON THE INSTITUTIONS. AND IF THERE WERE ANOTHER STATEWIDE COORDINATING ENTITY I WOULD SUGGEST THAT BOTH THINK ABOUT WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS A CROSS BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS WHAT THOSE NEEDS ARE FOR STUDENTS AND INSTITUTIONS. AND WHAT THE NEEDS OF THE ECONOMY ARE BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY THE ROBUST. KIND OF AGENCY OR OR FUNCTION THAT WE NEED I THINK AS A STATE SO. CALIFORNIA COMPETES IS DONE A FAIR AMOUNT OF WORK ON WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE CALIFORNIA'S ONE OF TWO STATES IN THE NATION THAT DOES NOT HAVE SUCH A COORDINATING ENTITY. AND WE'D BE VERY MUCH SUPPORTIVE OF TRYING TO HELP FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT WOULD WORK BEST FOR CALIFORNIA GIVEN WHERE WE ARE TODAY. IT CERTAINLY SEEMS A THAT WE ARE MISSING THAT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO MY SECOND QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH YOUR STATEMENT. ABOUT THE INLAND EMPIRE. WHICH I REPRESENT. AND AND LET YOU KNOW STUDENTS. AND THEIR LACK OF ACHIEVEMENT. AN AND I WILL NOTE THAT. EVEN IN THAT STATEMENT UC RIVERSIDE WHICH IN MY DISTRICT. PROBABLY HAS THE VERY HIGHEST A DIVERSITY OF ANY OF THE UC'S AND PROBABLY GRADUATES NOTE BUT A LARGE NUMBER OF BECAUSE I'VE BEEN A GRADUATION. OF LATINO STUDENTS A EVERY YEAR AND DOES A GREAT JOB WITH AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. AS WELL. SO MY MY MY QUESTION IS HOW IMPORTANT ARE LATINO STUDENTS TO CLOSING THE. ACHIEVEMENT GAP. AND. WHAT ELSE CAN THE STATE DO? I THOUGHT YOU KNOW LATINO STUDENTS ARE CENTRAL TO CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP WHEN YOU LOOK AND WE HAVE A DEMOGRAPHER HERE WHO CAN TALK WITH US ABOUT THAT THE CHANGING CALIFORNIA POPULATION BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COMPATIBILITY OF STUDENTS IN THE STATE. INCREASINGLY. THE LARGEST SHARE AM. AND MANY OF OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE LATINO STUDENTS AND SO WE REALLY CAN'T GET TO. TO THIS THIS GOAL WITHOUT TAKING VERY SERIOUSLY THE GAPS THAT WE IN THE DISPARITIES THAT WE FACE BY RACE. LATINO STUDENTS AND AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR ARE AT RISK OF NOT GRADUATING WHAT WE SEE IS A LOT OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS WHO WENT UP. PARTICULARLY MEN WHO END UP FOR OUR ATTENDING PRIVATE FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS. BUMP INTO WE REALLY NEED TO JUST HAVE A MUCH CLEANER FOCUS ON WHAT KINDS OF STRATEGIES WE NEED TED TO MOVE THROUGH THAT I KNOW OUR COLLEAGUES FROM DRC YOU'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT A PROJECT THAT THEY ARE LOOKING UP IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. LATINO WHICH IS LOOKING AT HOW TO YOU AND MOVE THE NEEDLE IN PARTICULAR ON LATINO STUDENTS. BUT I THINK THAT IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF. OF OF THE STORY IN ABOUT TWO WEEKS WE'RE GONNA BE COMING OUT WITH A SET OF FACT SHEETS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES HAS DEVELOPED ON RACE IN THE ECONOMY THAT'LL SHOW SOME OF THE DID THESE DISPARITIES BY RACE. AND SUGGEST WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO REALLY MOVE STUDENTS BOTH THROUGH THE PIPELINE AS WELL AS ENSURE THAT THEY'RE IN THE ECONOMY. AND LASTLY A NOT A QUESTION BUT A A STATEMENT AND THAT IS THAT IT IS ALSO STRIKING TO ME. THAT AT THE TIME THAT LATINO STUDENTS MAKE SUCH A HIGH. A PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION AND MAKE CREATE SUCH A HIGH PERCENTAGE. OF THE COLLEGE STUDENTS IS THE EXACT TIME OR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DECIDES TO NOT FUND HIGHER EDUCATION AT THE RATES THAT IT HAS IN THE PAST. THANK. THANK YOU AND I WILL HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS LEVINE LIMON BUT I WAS GOING TO FOLLOW UP ON MISTER MEDINA'S QUESTION. THE IT BUT JUST FIRST WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE WHOLE NOTION AS FAR AS THAT THAT MASTER PLAN IN THE TWELVE AND THIRTY THREE FOR UC AND CSU RESPECTFULLY I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT AND. I KNOW THAT MISTER BERMAN'S. SUBCOMMITTEE I MEAN SELECT COMMITTEE HAS BEEN TAKING A LOOK AT THIS TOO BUT I I THINK WE OUGHT TO ASK OURSELVES THE QUESTION IS IS IS THAT THE MAGIC NUMBER. SIXTY YEARS AGO YOU DIDN'T NEED A DEGREE TO GET A GOOD PAYING JOB IN A BE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS. THAT WAS NEVER CODIFIED THE AD CODE IT WAS THAT A PLAN AND SO THAT WAS THEN THIS IS NOW IN SO I REALLY THINK WE OUGHT TO. THINK ABOUT WHETHER THROUGH THE OTHER A BUDGET PROSELYTIZATION AND WHAT HAVE YOU. AND STATUTORILY CHANGE THAT AND PUT IT AND PUT IT IN AND ARE CALIFORNIA. THE EDUCATION CODE AS FAR AS I HIGHER NUMBERS AND GOALS BECAUSE REALLY REFLECT THE NEEDS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW BY DIDN'T ASK ON THE ON THE IN. THE NUMBERS AND EQUITY ISSUES. YOU KNOW IT'S EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING FOR A LOT OF US WE LOOK AT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN OUR COLLEGES DON'T REFLECT IN THE COMMUNICABLE JUST PRETTY GOOD CSU. UP PRETTY GOOD TO YOU SEE UP NOT SELF. SO IF IF WE DID HAVE FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE UC LOOK AT THEM GO FROM THAT THAT TWELVE AND A HALF TO THE TO THE SEVENTEEN. COULD WE EXPECT THAT WE WOULD HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACTS IN DIVERSIFYING THAT THE UC POPULATION LIKE WE SEE AT CSU. SO IT IS THE CASE THAT IF YOU SEE HOLD AND MORE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES IT WOULD. HAVE A MORE DIVERSE SET OF STUDENTS ATTENDING SO IT WOULD GO PART WAY. TOWARDS CLOSING THOSE. DIFFERENCES. ABOUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WE NEED BETTER HIGH SCHOOL PREPARATION AS WELL SO THAT WE HAVE. MORE LATINOS MORE AFRICAN AMERICANS SPEND MORE LOW INCOME STUDENTS. WHO ARE? ELIGIBLE FOR YOU SEE. EVEN AT THAT THE TOP SEVENTEEN AND A HALF PERCENT OF THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO. AND AGAIN THERE'S BEEN PROGRESS MADE. IF YOU LOOK AT A THREE G. COMPLACENT BUT IT'S STILL NOT SUFFICIENT AND THE GAPS REMAIN QUITE QUITE LARGE. THANK YOU SO MEMBER LIVING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS THIS FIRST HOURS GONE BY REALLY QUICKLY AND I REGRET THAT I NEED TO DEPART. THAT I WON A COUPLE COMMENTS IN OUR QUEST BUT BOTH OF YOU BUT ALSO OF THE SYSTEMS ARE THAT ARE GOING TO BE PROVIDING TESTIMONY LATER. FIRST OF ALL. OF MISTER JOHNSON YOU WOULD TALK YOU MENTIONED. THE CS USE CHANGE IN THE REMEDIATION POLICY WHICH I APPLIED OUT WHICH IS A HUGE BARRIER FOR STUDENTS JUST TO TAKE THEIR GENERAL EDUCATION MATHEMATICS REQUIREMENT SO STUDENTS STILL NEED TO TAKE. A G. E. IN MATHEMATICS. AT THE CSU AND IT THIS A HUGE BARRIER TO JUST EARNING UNITS. IS GONE BECAUSE ATTORNEY REMEDIAL CLASSES EARNED ZERO UNITS THAT THAT'S INSIDE PAY FOR THAT DID NOT GET THEM TO GRADUATION SO THAT IS A GREAT MOVE BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. THE. AT MISTER CHAIR OF MR MEDINA HAD MENTIONED. THE DEMISE AND END OF SEPAK AND. A LITTLE BIT OF A QUESTION OF WHO SETS THE AGENDA NOW FOR HIGHER EDUCATION WHICH I THINK WE WILL CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH HOW WE COORDINATE THAT BEYOND THE HEADS OF THE THREE SYSTEMS. BUT TAHT BUT IT IN IN THAT THAT ABSENCE IN THE VOID. THE LEGISLATURE HAS STEPPED UP SOMEWHAT. AND DIE IN IN PARTICULAR I WANT TO ASK FOR SOME HELP BOTH FROM YOU AS WELL AS FROM THE SYSTEMS IN. HELPING US LEARN FROM A LAW THAT I AUTHORED LAST YEAR. ON HAVING A TO POINT THE DOCTOR JOSI MADE. ON WHETHER HAVING THAT THE THE SEGMENTS BE MORE CONNECTED WITH THE JOBS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE REGION'S AFTER THE EMPLOYMENT THAT'S NECESSARY AND SO I AUTHORED AB NINE FIFTY SEVEN. THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES VERY. UP QUICKLY. CONNECTED WITH AN OBAMA ERA PROGRAM TO BE TIED IN WITH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PORTS AND MY BILL. OUT REQUIRED THIS YEAR'S YOU REQUESTED THE YOU SEE TO ENGAGE IN THE VERY SAME WAY. AND IT'S TOO SOON TO LEARN WHAT THE OUTCOMES OF THAT OUR. IT BUT. BUT I THINK THAT IN A FEW YEARS WE MAY HAVE A SENSE BOTH OF HOW THE SYSTEMS HAVE CHANGED THEIR COURSE OFFERINGS IN THEIR PROGRAM OFFERINGS AND OF COURSE IF THE. THE UPTAKE FROM THE STUDENTS. MATCHES THE OFFERINGS OF THIRD THAT SKILL DESIRE. IS MATCHED AS WELL AS IF THOSE. EVENTUALLY ENDED UP INTO JOBS IN THOSE REGIONS WHICH IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT NOT JUST FOR ECONOMIC SUCCESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS BUT THE REGION'S THEMSELVES. AND DIED AND SO. IF I HAD PUT IN TO THE BILL THAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY STUDY WEATHER AT ALL CURRENT WOULD INTO EXPENSIVE AND THEN WE PROBABLY WENT TO BELA. AFFORD TO PAY FOR THAT BILL BUT WE WILL NEED THE HELP FROM THE SYSTEMS EVERYONE'S LAUGHING BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW THAT GOES. CAN AND DOES SO THE HELP FROM SYSTEMS AS WELL AS HELP FROM OBSERVERS LIKE YOU WHO CARE. TO SEE IN IN THE GOT COMING YEARS IF THAT IN FACT KURT I WOULD BE GREATLY. APPRECIATIVE OF THAT I THINK WE ALL WOULD WOULD BENEFIT FROM THAT KNOWLEDGE. AND LASTLY ANOTHER POINT THAT. THAT MR MEDINA REALLY APTLY MADE WHICH IS. THAT. THE RISE IN THE LATINO POPULATION IS COMING AT A TIME WHEN SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION. IS SLOWING DRAMATICALLY SO IT'S IT'S NOT GOING DOWN BUT IT'S GROWING AS A SHARE OF THE STATE BUDGET. IT'S LESS THAN IT HAD BEEN IN THE PAST AND. IN IS DECLINING. AND. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE POINTS THAT WE HAVE TO JUST KIND OF. TAKE A MEASURE OF THIS MOMENT AND SAY HOW DO WE PREPARE CALIFORNIA FOR A BETTER FUTURE AND IT'S GOING TO BE GROWING PUBLIC INVESTMENT NOT SLOWING DOWN PUBLIC INVESTMENT. AND SO I THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE A REALLY. STRONG COMMITMENT JUST TO THE STATE IN ITSELF TO RECOMMIT THAT TODD BACK GROWTH TO A LEVEL THAT MEETS THE STATE'S NEEDS RATHER THAN ON. IN A SENSE. I AS COSTS GO UP THAT WE SHRINK AWAY FROM COVERING THOSE COSTS AND DIED OUT ALLOW FOR. DOT FUTURE TO ALSO BE DIMINISHED SO THANK YOU BOTH VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MS LOW. THINK YOU AND I WANTED TO COME AND SOMETHING THAT US SUMMER CREEK SILVA HAD MENTIONED AND I KNOW THAT AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT I WORKED WITH ACTUALLY HAD A EVERY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT WHO KNEW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND ASSESSMENT ON THE HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSAT THE STUDENT WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE BUT THEY ALSO HAD. KIND OF A DAY WHERE YOU HAVE THE ADMISSIONS DEPARTMENT THE TRANSFER CENTERS THE FINANCIAL AID DEPARTMENT THE COUNSELING SERVICES AND STUDENT SERVICES COME TO TALK TO THE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. SO I THINK THAT PERHAPS. IF WE REFRAME. HER QUESTION ABOUT YOU KNOW. INTO IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE DOING. AND AND WHAT KIND OF OUTREACH AYE IS HAPPENING IN HIGHER ED WITH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THE UC'S HAVE THE EARLY ACADEMIC OUTREACH PROGRAMS. A AND THAT YOU KNOW SEE SACK HAS THE THAT THE YOU KNOW THE CAL SO PROGRAMS. THERE THERE'S A NUMBER OF THINGS. THAT ARE HAPPENING IN SO MAYBE IT'S TRYING TO IDENTIFY ARE THESE CLUSTERED JUST IN CERTAIN REGIONS AND NOT IN OTHER REGIONS AND MAYBE THAT'S WHERE IT NOW IF WE START TO DESEGREGATE SOME OF THE DATA. MAYBE THAT TELLS US SOMETHING ELSE. BUT THERE'S BEEN A HISTORY OF EFFORTS TO REACH OUT TO STUDENTS EARLY ON AND TO HELP THEM HAVE A PLAN. UP HAVING SAID THAT AND WE KNOW RIGHT NOW THERE'S A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THE GUIDED PATHWAYS BUT THE CONCEPT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES HAVE STUDENTS HAVE A PLAN. AND THAT'S NOT. A NEW CONCEPT AND SO I GUESS THAT TO. YOU KNOW. HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE THE CONCEPT ISN'T NEW? I WE'VE TRIED IT WE HAVE TRANSFER AGREEMENTS WE HAVE YOU KNOW THE A DEBT SEE WE HAD THE CSU BREADTH REQUIREMENTS. BACK BUT YOU KNOW HOW HOW DO WE TACKLE IT BECAUSE THIS THIS IDEAS BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES THAT WE NEED TO REACH OUT TO STUDENTS EARLY. BUT WE ALSO NEED THEM TO HAVE A PLAN AND WE NEED TO HELP THEM WITH THAT PLAN AND I THINK WE'VE STRUGGLED. IN HIGHER ED TO DO THAT WE'VE MADE TUNES. AND PERHAPS THOSE GAINS ARE SUSTAIN WITH FUNDING AND THAT WE SEE IT ROLL BACK ON AFTERWARDS WERE LIKE YEA WEGOT OUR MARKS UP YOU KNOW WE HAVE MORE STUDENTS ENROLLED THERE MORE APPLICANTS BUT. HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THAT NOW? CAN YOU PLEASE. SO I AYE MOONLIGHT AS CHAIR OF THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION WHICH I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE SAID BEFORE I STARTED. AND SO I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE KELSO PROGRAM BECAUSE IT IS THE STUDENT AID COMMISSIONS EFFORT TO ACTUALLY GET THAT INFORMATION TO STUDENTS EARLY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE COMPLETING THEIR FAT CITED I WORKED FOR KELSO FOR NUMBER YEAH HOW I LIKE IT I LIKE. IT RUNS IN PAGE. SO I THINK THE COUNCIL BUT THE PART AND IT'S ALSO TRUE IS YOU KNOW THAT WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE CONCEPTS FOR EVERY REGION IN THE STATE. AND WE ARE NOW THINKING ABOUT IT THIS DO NAY COMMISSION HOW CAN WE RETHINK THAT ARE WE SERVING THAT THE MOST AT NEED. IMMEDIATE STUDENTS AND YOU KNOW IDEALLY WE'D HAVE A COUNCIL FOR EVERY REGION BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES FOR THAT SO THERE IS A RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS. ON BUT WE ARE VERY MINDFUL PARTICULARLY WITH THIS ISSUE RELATED TO LATINO STUDENTS AND AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS AND WE'RE LOOKING AT RATES. OF. TRANCE OR NOT TRANSFER BUT RATES OF MATRICULATION INTO A CUP COLLEGE WHERE WE HAVE GAPS AND WHERE WE HAVE GAPS BY REGION SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS ON. THE AGENDA AND ON THE MINDS OF THOSE OF US AT PEPSI SOCK. IN TERMS OF GUIDED PATHWAYS I THINK THAT. IT IS TRUE THAT WE HAVE SOME SENSE OF WHAT THE PATHWAY PERHAPS OUGHT TO BE. I THINK THEY'RE A COUPLE OF OF REAL CONSTRAINTS DEL AND THAT IS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN ENORMOUSLY COMPLEX HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. YOU KNOW IT'S JUST REALLY HARD IT'S HARD IF YOU'RE STUDENT AND YOU'RE TRYING TO DECIDE YOU KNOW I'M AT A COMMUNITY COLLEGE ACTS AND I WANT TO TRANSFER TO MAYBE A YOU SEE OR MAYBE A CS YOU. AND GUESS WHAT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME REQUIREMENTS FOR EVERY INSTITUTION RIGHT SO I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT COURSES I NEED FOR THIS SCHOOL WITHOUT SCHOOL AND FOR THE SCHOOL AND WHAT THAT DOES IS THAT AND IT DRIVES ENROLLMENT IT DRIVES GOD TIME TO DEGREE. BECAUSE STUDENTS ARE SPENDING LONGER IN SCHOOL TRYING TO GET ALL OF THOSE COURSES SO THAT THEY CAN THEN TRANSFER TO THE INSTITUTION OR HAVE A CHOICE. CHOICE ABOUT WHAT INSTITUTION THEM ON A TRANSFER TO SO THERE ARE SOME REALLY LEGITIMATE BARRIERS AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S THIS TENSION BETWEEN THE INSTITUTIONAL. DEMANDS FOR FOR ADMITTING STUDENTS AND BOB THE PREPARATION OF STUDENTS BUT I WOULD AGREE THAT HAVING STUDENTS HAVE A PLAN IS A PART OF IT BUT YOU CAN'T. IT'S HARD HAVE A PLAN FOR FOUR DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND SO PART OF IT HAS TO DO WITH SOME KIND OF STREAMLINING I THINK ON THE OTHER SIDE. SO THAT IT IS MUCH CLEARER TO STUDENTS WHAT THE OPPORTUNITY STRUCTURE IS IF THEY FOLLOW THE PLAN AND THEY DON'T NEED HOW FOR DIFFERENT PLANS. CLINTON LET ME JUST ADD SO AS USUAL I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING LONG THEY SAID. I WOULD I WOULD IDENTIFY THREE CHARACTERISTICS OF WHAT'S NECESSARY AND WHY SOME OF THESE. PROGRAMS AND INTERVENTIONS HAVEN'T HAVEN'T. MET WITH LONG TERM SUCCESS AS AS YOU MENTIONED SO FIRST I THINK WE NEED. COMPREHENSIVE PLANS ESTHER IS HIT BY COMPREHENSIVE THAT MEANS ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDING ALL THE WAY FROM NINTH GRADE TO HIGH SCHOOL WHAT'S REQUIRED AS WELL AS WHAT'S REQUIRED. ONCE YOU GET TO COLLEGE DEPENDING ON WHAT PATH YOU WANT TO PURSUE THEIR. I'D ALSO SAY UNIVERSAL IF WE CALL CALIFORNIA THE UNIVERSE WHICH CALIFORNIA OFTEN DOES BUT. WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS JUST THEY CAN'T JUST BE ONE REGION OR ONE PLACE OR ONE SCHOOL IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE STATEWIDE ALL THE WAY DOWN TO TELL A EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND EVERY COLLEGE IN OUR STATE? AND THEN FINALLY TIMING THAT HOUSE TO HAPPEN AT THE RIGHT TIME IN A STUDENT'S LIFE. AND IN MANY CASES THAT MEANS NINTH GRADE BEFORE YOU START NIGHT GREAT ACTUALLY IN MIDDLE SCHOOL SO THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO DO. WHEN YOU GET TO HIGH SCHOOL UNDERSTANDING THE A THROUGH G. COURSES IT'S HARD ENOUGH FOR A COLLEGE EDUCATED PARENTS TEND TO KNOW OKAY THESE ARE A THREE G. THESE ARCADE FRUITY. LET ALONE FOR A STUDENT WHO COMES FROM A FAMILY WHERE. NONE NEITHER OF THE THAT THE PARENTS HAVE GONE TO COLLEGE AND SO. AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK THEN THIS CALLS FOR INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSES THAT ARE STUDENT CENTRIC. PROGRAMS AND INTERVENTIONS RATHER THAN INSTITUTIONAL. ES TO FIND FOCUSED AND WEEKS WERE SAYING SOME OF THESE CHANGES HAPPENING ALREADY SO FOR EXAMPLE. CAMPUSES THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES CSU AND YOU SEE ARE THINKING ABOUT COURSE SCHEDULES IN LIGHT OF STUDENT DEMAND TO MEET THIS. THAT THE PLANS THAT STUDENTS HOW FOR THEM SO THAT STUDENTS CAN ACTUALLY TAKE THE COURSES WHEN THEY NEED TO TAKE THEM IN THE NOT. LOCKED OUT OF THE COURSE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT SUFFICIENT ROOM SO THERE'S SOME SIMPLE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING. THAT SEEM TO BE. ALREADY HELPING BUT THEY NEED TO BE COMPREHENSIVE THEY NEED TO BE. ACROSS THE SYSTEM AND THEY NEED TO BE AT THE RIGHT TIME. I WOULD JUST WALK OUT AT ONE NOTE THAT ADVISING IS ALSO A HUGE PART OF THE THE. A CHALLENGE THAT STUDENTS HAVE IN TERMS OF COMING UP WITH THOSE PLANS BECAUSE DESPITE THE INCREDIBLE. AND AND MY KIDS WILL TELL YOU THAT EVERYTHING THEY DO IT THROUGH THE COMPUTER IT'S REALLY HARD THROUGH GOOGLE OR YOU KNOW AN ONLINE. JUST AN ONLINE. AT A TOOL TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW YOU'RE GONNA NAVIGATE THESE VERY COMPLEX SYSTEMS AND WE DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF ADVISING ON THE HIGH ON THE HIGHER ED SIDE OR ON THE K. TWELVE SIDE TO ACTUALLY HELP STUDENTS IN NINTH GRADE. OR TENTH OR ELEVENTH OR TWELFTH GRADE FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT PATHWAYS. YOU WE HAVE THE AND ANY INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE LOOKING AT KIND OF OUT OF THE BOX ADVISING MODELS. WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOWOFF HOURS WEEKEND HOURS. I MEAN I FEEL LIKE I DO ANYTHING TECH AND I GOT ONLINE ADVISING NOW I DON'T KNOW. IF THERE'S OTHER MODELS TO CONSIDER. LIKE I DON'T KNOW THAT I'LL BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH ENDING ON THE SPOT BUT I KNOW THAT WHEN THE GOVERNOR HAD HIS INNOVATION PRIZE. OF THE FIRST TIME WHICH I THINK WAS IN TWENTY FIFTEEN OTHER WERE THINK WHERE ABOUT. FIFTY NINE APPLICATIONS AND AT LEAST FORTY TWO OF THEM REALLY SPOKE TO GAPS IN ADVISING OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS UP AND A LOT OF THE INNOVATIONS THAT WERE THEN BEING PROPOSED WORK INNOVATIONS TO GET IT HOW DO YOU FIX THE ADVISING FUNCTION OR IMPROVING ADVISING FUNCTION. WITHIN HIGHER EDUCATION SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME MODELS OUT THERE ON THE NOT BE HAPPY TO KIND OF LOOK THROUGH IT AND AND PASSED ALONG. OF. RANDY AND MISLEAD BONE. YOUR DISCUSSION GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE I SEE OUT IN THE AUDIENCE A SEVERAL OF THE. COLLEGE COUNSELORS OF THAT I SAW LAST NIGHT AND. AND TO MENTION THAT THIS IS NATIONAL COUNSELING WEEK NOW FULLER WEEK AND ALSO THE MENTION. OF YOU KNOW HAVING BEEN A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER. THE FACT THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT COUNSELING THE OVER BURDEN OF STUDENTS THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT THE COUNSELORS. HAVE TO DEAL WITH A IN THEIR LOAD SO THAT YOU KNOW IF. TEACHERS ARE FACING THIRTY SIX STUDENTS IN THE CLASSROOM COUNSELORS OR. LOOKING AT TWO THOUSAND. STUDENTS A THOUSAND STUDENTS THAT THEY HAVE TO ATTEMPT TO MEET WITH. A ONCE A YEAR. IN ORDER TO TRY TO DO THE COUNSELING THAT THE ACADEMIC COUNSELING THAT THEY DO SO I JUST WANTED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE COUNSELORS AND. THANK THEM FOR THEIR HARD WORK EVERYDAY DAY IN AND DAY OUT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION VERY VALUABLE AND WITH THAT I'LL BRING UP. ALEXANDER MAYOR FROM MD RC TO DISCUSS THE GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH SHOWING WHAT IS EFFECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANTLY. INCREASES THE DEGREE ATTAINMENT AND OTHER STATES HE WILL ALSO DISKETTES SOME METHODS AND PRACTICES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK IT TEAR MEDINA AND THANK YOU DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS. MY NAME IS ALEX MEHR NINE THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR POST SECONDARY EDUCATION AND NDRC. NDRC IS A NONPROFIT NONPARTISAN EDUCATION AND SOCIAL POLICY RESEARCH ORGANIZATION. WE'RE DEDICATED TO FINDING WHAT WORKS TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE. AND POST SECONDARY EDUCATION WE EVALUATE PROGRAMS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND WE TRY NEW SOLUTIONS AND TEST THEM BASED ON RESEARCH. WE HAVE OFFICES BOTH IN OAKLAND AND IN LOS ANGELES AND WE'VE TESTED MANY PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING A STATEWIDE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. THERE ARE THREE POINTS ALLEN EMPHASIZED MY RESEARCH BEFORE I TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE EVALUATED. FIRST SHORT TERM PROGRAMS TEND TO HAVE MODEST SHORT TERM RESULTS WELL THIS MEANS THAT SOMETIMES FALL SHORT OF THEIR GOALS THE FINDING STILL PROVIDE LESSONS THAT WE CAN BUILD ON AND THE PROGRAMS THEMSELVES ARE HAPPENING ARE HELPING STUDENTS ADVANCE. WHILE THE PROGRAMS ARE OPERATING. SECOND IT IS POSSIBLE TO DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE STUDENT OUTCOMES. WE'VE SEEN THIS A COUPLE OF PROGRAMS THAT I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT AND HIGHLIGHT IN MY TESTIMONY TODAY. AND THIRD COMBINING AND INTEGRATING MULTIPLE EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS MULTIPLE FACTORS CAN BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE. MOST OF THE FINDINGS I'M GOING TO DISCUSS TODAY ARE FROM RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS. AND A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL STUDENTS ARE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED BY LOTTERY EITHER TO PARTICIPATE IN A NEW PROGRAM. OR TO A CONTROL GROUP. STUDENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN THE NEW PROGRAM BUT THEY STILL HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE EXISTING SERVICES THAT THEY WOULD NORMALLY HAVE ACCESS TO. RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS OF THE GOLD STANDARD AND EVALUATION RESEARCH. THEY'RE THE SAME AT THAT YOU THINK CLINICAL TRIALS TO EVALUATE NEW MEDICAL TREATMENTS. AND HERE IT IS EVALUATED A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THESE INCLUDE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS LIKE PERFORMANCE BASED SCHOLARSHIPS AND DIFFERENT WAYS TO DISPERSE STUDENTS REMAINING PAUL REFUNDS. INCLUDE LEARNING COMMUNITIES ENHANCE STUDENT SERVICES INCLUDING ADDITIONAL VISITS TO ADVISORS. AND STOOD ON. AND STUDENT SUCCESS COURSES WE'VE STARTED INSTRUCTIONAL REFORMS AND WERE NOW STUDYING INCREASINGLY BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMS THAT COMBINE MULTIPLE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES. WHEN WE LOOK ACROSS THE STUDIES WE FIND THAT SHORT TERM PROGRAMS THAT LAST FOR ONE OR TWO SEMESTERS GENERALLY PRODUCE MODEST SHORT TERM RESULTS. HOWEVER WHEN SEVERAL THESE PROGRAMS ARE COMBINED INTO AN INTEGRATED STRATEGY AND WHEN STUDENTS EXPERIENCE THEM FROM SEMESTER TO SEMESTER THE TOTAL EFFECT CAN BE DRAMATIC. THE MOST EFFECTIVE PROGRAM WE'VE STUDIED IS THE CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK'S XCELERATED STUDY AND ASSOCIATE PROGRAMS. KNOWN AS A SAP. A STEP INTEGRATES MULTIPLE STRATEGIES IT REQUIRES STUDENTS TO ENROLL FULL TIME AND IT SUPPORTS THEM TO DO THIS. TUITION WAIVERS WITH TEXTBOOKS WITH TEXTBOOK VOUCHERS AND WITH THREE METRO CARDS THAT CAN BE USED FOR UNLIMITED USE ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. A STEP ALSO PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORT SERVICES SUCH AS REGULAR HIGH TOUCH ADVISING. CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND TUTORING. A SAP IS BOTH AN OPPORTUNITY AND AN OBLIGATION FOR STUDENTS. IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE METRO CARDS AND THE OTHER BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM STUDENTS MUST BE WITH THEIR ADVISOR TWICE A MONTH AND SATISFY OTHER PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. THE PROGRAM LASTS FOR THREE FULL YEARS. OUR VALUATION FOUND THAT IT NEARLY DOUBLED THE THREE YEAR GRADUATION RATE INCREASING AT FROM TWENTY TWO PERCENT TO FORTY PERCENT. NOW THESE ARE ALL STUDENTS WHO ENTERED INTENDING TO EARN A TWO YEAR DEGREE. AND THE SUB SUBJECT OF REMEDIATION CAME UP EARLIER ALL OF THE STUDENTS NEEDED REMEDIATION. ACCEPTED NOTHING AND NOTHING INSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM THIS IS ALL AROUND SUPPORT SERVICES AND IT NEARLY DOUBLED THE TWO YEAR COULD THE THREE YEAR GRADUATION RATE. GIVEN THE STRENGTH OF THE FINDINGS UNION NDRC PARTNER TO BRING A SAP TO THE A SET MODEL TO OTHER STATES. THREE COLLEGES IN OHIO HAVE NOW REPLICATED THE PROGRAM AND THE EARLY RESULTS ARE VERY PROMISING. BY JUST A SECOND SEMESTER THE PROGRAM INCREASED ENROLLMENT BY TWELVE PERCENTAGE POINTS AND INCREASED FULL TIME ENROLLMENT BY TWENTY FOUR PERCENTAGE POINTS. STUDENTS ARE ALSO EARNING MORE CREDITS. THESE RESULTS ALIGN CLOSELY WITH WHAT WE OBSERVED AT A SIMILAR TIME POINT IN THE ORIGINAL CUNY A STEP PROGRAM. WE ARE NOW WORKING WITH TWO OTHER COLLEGES TO IMPLEMENT A SAP INCLUDING SKYLINE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN CALIFORNIA. AND ANOTHER EXAMPLE WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE DETROIT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WHICH ADMINISTERS THE DETROIT PROMISE PROGRAM. THE DETROIT PROMISE PROGRAM COVERS TUITION AND FEES FOR DETROIT PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES. ALTHOUGH THE PROMISE PROGRAM HELPS STUDENTS ENROLL IN COLLEGE TWO IF YOU STAY IN SCHOOL AND TOO FEW GRADUATE. TO IMPROVE ACADEMIC OUTCOMES THE CHAMBER AND MY ORGANIZATION AND THEY ARE SEE PARTNER TO ADD. EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM ENHANCEMENTS TO THE EXISTING SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM THAT ENHANCE PROGRAM INCLUDES CAMPUS COACHES WHO HELP STUDENTS NAVIGATE ACADEMIC AND PERSONAL ISSUES. MODEST FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR EXPENSES WHICH A CONTINGENT ON MEETING WITH COACHES TWICE A MONTH. BEHAVIORAL MESSAGING TO ENCOURAGE SUMMER ENROLLMENT. AND A MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM THAT TRACKS STUDENT DATA STUDENT PARTICIPATION AND CAN BE USED TO COMMUNICATE WITH STUDENTS. BY JUST THE SECOND SEMESTER OF THE PROGRAM THE COMBINED PACKAGE OF STUDENTS SUPPORTS HAD VERY LARGE EFFECTS. AND INCREASED ENROLLMENT BY ELEVEN PERCENTAGE POINTS AND INCREASED FULL TIME ENROLLMENT BY FIFTEEN PERCENTAGE POINTS. WE'RE NOW EXPANDING OUR WORK WITH BRIGHT WITH PROMISE PROGRAMS WE'RE CURRENTLY PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THE FIVE OTHER PROGRAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY INCLUDING TWO IN CALIFORNIA THE LOS ANGELES COLLEGE PROMISE AND THE RICHMOND PROMISE. FINANCING AND SCALING STRATEGIES LIKE THESE CAN BE CHALLENGING. DATA MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE IMPORTANT AND THEY CAN ALSO LEAD TO EFFICIENCIES. THEY CAN BE IS THE MONITOR STUDENT PARTICIPATION AND AUTOMATE MESSAGING FOR FREEING UP STAFF TIME SO THAT STAFF CAN FOCUS ON MORE CHALLENGING STUDENT ISSUES. EVEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS THOSE LEAVE MANY STUDENTS WITHOUT GOOD ACADEMIC OUTCOMES AND THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO DO. AND THE CUNY A SAP EXAMPLE. SIXTY PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS HAD NOT EARNED A DEGREE AFTER THREE YEARS. SO WE'RE CONTINUING TO FAST NEW APPROACHES TO FILL THE GAP. THE DATA CENTERS MATHEMATICS PATHWAYS IN TEXAS IS ONE APPROACH THIS IS A MAJOR INSTRUCTIONAL REFORM OF DEVELOPMENTAL OR REMEDIAL MATH. INSTEAD OF TEACHING ALGEBRA TO ALL STUDENTS THE PROGRAM OFFERS STATISTICS AND QUANTITATIVE PATHWAYS THAT ALIGN WITH STUDENTS MAJORS. AND STRUCTURES INSTRUCTORS ALSO AVOID LECTURING AND THEY FOCUS MORE ON INTERACTIVE FORMS OF STUDENT LEARNING THEIR EARLY RESULTS ARE PROMISING AND THIS ALSO RELATES TO THE PROGRAM THAT HANS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION. WE'RE ALSO TESTING A VARIETY OF BEHAVIORAL STRATEGIES INCLUDING INCENTIVES AND MESSAGING TO INCREASE SUMMER MOMENTUM AT TEN COLLEGES IN OHIO. AND A TEXT MESSAGING STRATEGY TO INCREASE POST SECONDARY ENROLLMENT AMONG LOW INCOME ADULTS AT EIGHTEEN EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY CENTERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND FINALLY WERE ALSO COLLABORATING WITH A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO INVESTIGATE PROMISING STRATEGIES THAT HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTIONS IN THIS IS THE PROGRAM THAT LINE I MENTIONED. A KEY LESSON FROM OUR RESEARCH IS THAT COMBINING AND INTEGRATING MULTIPLE STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS MULTIPLE FACTORS CAN BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE. AS CALIFORNIA REVISIT THIS POST SECONDARY PLAN TO DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE COMPLETION AND CONSIDERS CONSOLIDATION OF EXISTING PROGRAMS. THERE'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO INTEGRATE RESOURCES AND ALIGN THEM AROUND EVIDENCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU QUESTIONS YOUR COMMENTS. BUT A QUESTION TO. IN INDIA STUDIES THAT YOU'VE DONE AND AND OTHER STATES OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. I I I. I BELIEVE YOU FACE THE SAME CHALLENGES OF FOR STUDENTS AND ROLLING BUT NOT COMPLETING. DEGREES. SO WHAT WHAT HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES THAT YOU'VE FOUND. FOR STUDENTS IN AND COMPLETELY. AND COMPLAINING THERE THERE ARE A LOT OF CHALLENGES A STUDENT'S FACE AND IT'S HARD TO PUT YOUR FINGER ON ONE BUT I THINK REMEDIATION IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES. PARTICULARLY COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT AS YOU KNOW AND IT'S WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE LAST DISCUSSION ALSO A FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS. STUDENTS ARE COMING IN AND THEY'RE UNDER PREPARED FOR COLLEGE AND THEY HAVE TO TAKE REMEDIAL COURSES BEFORE THEY CAN EVEN GET INTO CREDIT BEARING COURSES. SO WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK AROUND THIS ISSUE WERE ALSO WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE RESEARCH CENTER ON A NATIONAL CENTER TO START TO STUDY STRATEGIES. THE DATACENTERS MATHEMATICS PATHWAY THAT I MENTIONED AS ONE OF THE STRATEGIES THAT'S DESIGNED TO CHANGE THE WAY DEVELOPMENTAL REMEDIAL MATHIS TAUGHT. SO THAT STUDENTS CAN PROGRESS THROUGH MORE QUICKLY OR THINK VERY EARLY PROMISING RESULTS WE HAVE ANOTHER MAJOR STUDY AS PART OF THAT CENTER WHICH IS AROUND USING MULTIPLE MEASURES LIVE RESULTS COMING OUT SOON FROM. A SEVEN COLLEGE STUDY THE NEW YORK STATE. BUT IT BUT REMEDIAL EDUCATION IS A HUGE PROBLEM BUT STUDENTS ALSO FACE A LOT OF OTHER PROBLEMS AND AND FINANCIAL THE FINANCIAL SIDE OF COLLEGE CAN'T BE. UNDERESTIMATED. AND SOME OF THE STUDIES YOU'VE DONE HAVE BEEN AND AND. SMALLER STATES IN CALIFORNIA. DIFFERENT POPULATIONS A YOU MENTIONED OHIO. HOW WELL DO YOU THINK THAT THE? STUDIES YOU'VE DONE OF THE MODELS THAT YOU LOOKED AT ARE APPLICABLE TO AYE CALIFORNIA AND CAN THEY BE SUCCESSFUL. IN CALIFORNIA. THAT THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION IT WE WE PREDOMINATELY LOOK FOR PROGRAMS THAT ARE SERVING LOW INCOME POPULATIONS AND WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON. STUDENTS OF MINORITY STUDENTS AS WELL. THAT THE PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE STUDIED OUR GENERAL APPROACH IS AFTER WE FOUND A PROGRAM THAT'S EFFECTIVE WHICH I DETEST THAT AGAIN IN MULTIPLE CONTEXT AND SO THE IDEA THE A STEP PROGRAM THAT I MENTIONED STARTED IN NEW YORK. WE TESTED IN OHIO AND AND THERE'S NOW PROGRAM THAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON IN CALIFORNIA. AT SKYLAND COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND SEVERAL OF OUR OTHER PROGRAMS WE'VE TESTED THESE AND MULTIPLE LOCATIONS AROUND THE COUNTRY. AND SO THE EVIDENCE SPACES BUILDING I THINK A LOT OF THE LESSONS THAT COME OUT OF THE STUDIES ARE APPLICABLE TO CALIFORNIA. AND AND AND AS I ASKED ABOUT THE CHALLENGES YOU KNOW I AS A COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRUSTEE. AS A COMMUNICATIVE JE INSTRUCTOR I I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES ESPECIALLY AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL IS THAT STUDENTS CANNOT OR OR NOT. FULL TIME STUDENT YOU NO I A THINK AT THE TIME WHEN I WAS A STUDENT IN THE. EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES WE WERE ALL FULL TIME AND THE ONLY THING THAT WE HAD TO WORRY ABOUT. WAS GOING TO SCHOOL GOING TO BUT NOW WE'RE SEEING STUDENTS WITH JOBS. PERHAPS MULTIPLE JOBS FACE SEEN. CHALLENGES AND KNOW WHAT IF THEY GONNA HAVE FOR DINNER. SO THAT THE THE CHALLENGE OF BEING FULL TIME I THINK IS CRUCIAL. AND ANY STEPS THAT WE CAN TAKE. AS WE DID LAST YEAR IN THE LEGISLATURE. OF WOULD COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS SAYING THAT IF YOU'RE A FULL TIME STUDENT WILL TAKE CARE OF YOUR. FEES I THINK IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. SKY. I THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY SO I I THINK THE RESULTS ARE REALLY INTRIGUING. AND WHAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT THE SUCCESS OF SIMILAR PROGRAMS YOU KNOW I USUALLY HERE WHILE WE DO THESE TEN THINGS AND IT LEADS TO THIS. LEVEL OF IMPROVEMENT AND OUT COMES AND IT DO YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF MORE FINELY GRAINED ANALYSIS OF EXACTLY WHY IT IS THESE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING OTHER SOME. PORTS THAT SEEM TO BE. MORE IMPORTANT THAN OTHERS IS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THE COMPREHENSIVE NATURE OF THE SUPPORT SYSTEM SUCH THAT THAT THE WHOLE IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS I MEAN. OUT WHAT WHAT CAN WE EXTRACT FROM THIS AS FAR AS WHAT MOST VALUABLE THAT THAT THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND IT'S IN OUT THAT'S ONE OF THE REAL CHALLENGES WE FACE BECAUSE IT'S IT'S VERY DIFFICULT THE KEYS OUT WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT. BUT WE DO TALK TO STUDENTS WE DO SURVEYS WITH STUDENTS WE TRY TO GET OUT THIS IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND WERE ALSO. CONSTANTLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LOWER THE COST OF THESE PROGRAMS SO WE FIGURED OUT NOW HOW TO DEVELOP WE HAVE A COST TOOL THAT WE CAN START TO SEE IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A PROGRAM LIKE. WHAT WE'RE DOING IN DETROIT FOR EXAMPLE TO A NEW AREA WE CAN START TO PRICE OUT WHAT EACH COMPONENT WILL COST AND THINK ABOUT THE PACKAGE AS A WHOLE? BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION THERE'S SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES LIKE THAT COME OUT AND I THINK ONE OF THEM IS JUST THE IMPORTANCE OF HIGH TOUCH ADVISING THIS GOES TO AND WHAT CHAIR MEDINA. MENTIONED ABOUT STUDENTS WHO ARE PART TIME AND FACING YOU KNOW MANY CHALLENGES AN ADVISER CAN BE SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP NAVIGATE THOSE KIND OF CHALLENGES. BUT GETTING STUDENTS TO ENGAGE WITH ADVISERS HAVING ADVISORS HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO TALK WITH STUDENTS IS A REAL CHALLENGES AND SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN MANY CASES AND WHAT WE STUDY TO PLACES LIKE UNITS THAT. ARE WAYS TO ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE SERVICES THAT WE KNOW CAN HELP THEM ALONG BUT ALSO TO SUPPORT THEM AT THE SAME TIME SO FOR EXAMPLE METROCARD. IS A VERY VALUABLE THING TO A STUDENT IN AND OF ITSELF BUT CAN ALSO HELP THEM I QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR COMING. AND SHARING YOUR YOUR FINDINGS WITH THIS THAT YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO INVITE YOU SEE. FORWARD. AND IF A. YOU WOULD PLEASE. INTRODUCE YOURSELVES TO US. WHAT? THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEDINA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES. THANKS VERY MUCH FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME VERY MUCH AND I WANT TO START BY THANKING ALL OF YOU. FOR THE SPORT THAT YOU PROVIDE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IT IS ESSENTIAL AND IT IS APPRECIATED SO. I BEFORE I INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUES I WANT TO I'M KIERAN FLAHERTY AND THE DIRECTOR OF STATE GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. I BEFORE I INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUES I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT JUST QUICKLY IF YOU PERSPECTIVES ON THE CLOSING THE GAP SCENARIO. AYE THEY REFERENCE IN THE PP I SEE RECORD OBVIOUSLY ELIGIBILITY TRANSFER COMPLETION RATES. I AND I DO WANNA TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON THAT. MISTER JOHNSON PROVIDED SOME GOOD INFORMATION AND SOME GOOD NUMBERS AND I WANT TO RELATE THAT A LITTLE BIT TO THE SUPPORT THE STATE HAS PROVIDED. SEND THE BUDGET ACTS OF TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN THERE IS A TARGET SAID OF ENROLLING SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. IN RESPONSE THE UNIVERSITY AND ROLLED OVER TEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATE SO WE'VE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WHEN IT COMES TO ENROLLMENT GROWTH AT THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL. THE STATE ALSO. ONCE AGAIN STARTED PROVIDING. FUNDS SPECIFICALLY FOR GRADUATE INSTRUCTION GRADUATE ENROLLMENT SO WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR THAT CONTRIBUTION. ON. THE NEXT POINT THAT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE IS THAT MY COLLEAGUE PAMELA IS GONNA SPEAK A BIT ABOUT THE RECENT CONTINUED INCREASES IN GRADUATION RATES. THAT'S EVEN SINCE THE TIME THAT THE PP I SEE REPORT HAS COME OUT SO I LET HER HANDLE THAT. BUT OBVIOUSLY ENROLLMENT GROWTH AS WELL AS OUR CURRENT ENROLLMENT AYE REQUIRES CLASSROOMS LABORATORIES INFRASTRUCTURE SO CAPITAL OUTLAY. AYE THE REPORT THAT YOU SEE SUBMITTED LAST YEAR ESTIMATED THAT AT LEAST TWO POINT FIVE TO THREE BILLION IN CAPITAL INVESTMENT. WOULD BE NEEDED TO ACCOMMODATE THE ANTICIPATED ENROLLMENT GROWTH THAT'S THE ADDITIONAL I THE ONE HUNDRED PLUS STUDENTS THAT WERE REFERENCED IN THE IN THE REPORT ON TOP OF. WHAT UC'S CURRENT PROPOSE NEEDS OF FIVE POINT SIX BILLION FOR CAPITAL OUTLAY? WELL THOSE ARE A LOT OF BIG NUMBERS BUT WHAT WE WANT TO TRY AND DO TODAY IS TRANSLATE WHAT THOSE GENERALITIES MEAN FOR STUDENTS AND THE CAMPUS. SO WE THOUGHT HAVING OUR AYE. WE NEED OF FINANCE AT THE DAVIS CAMPUS AYE KELLY RATLIFF OUGHT TO SORT OF ILLUSTRATE FOR YOU EN AND PUT A LITTLE BIT A MEANING BEHIND THE NUMBERS FROM A STUDENT CAMPUS PROSPECTIVE. BOB SAW THIS CLOSE BY SAYING THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE PROVIDING OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE STUDENTS WITH THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. AYE THIS INCLUDES OF COURSE OUR PARTNERSHIP ON FINANCIAL AID. WITH THE STATE AND THE INSTITUTIONAL AID BOTH. WE REALLY DO WANT TO HIRE MORE FACULTY IN ADDRESS SOME OF THE OTHER IMPACTS OF ENROLLMENT GROWTH INSURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS AND ACHIEVEMENT GAP IN GRADUATION RATES. OUT SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS SO ALLOW MY COLLEAGUE PAMELA BROWN WHO IS THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH IN ACADEMIC PLANNING. FOR THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT TO TAKE OVER FROM THERE SONY PAMELA. THANK YOU KAREN I AM IN MY ROLE AS A VICE PRESIDENT FOR INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH AND ACADEMIC PLANNING I REPORT TO THE PROVOST AND PROVIDE DECISION SUPPORT FOR YOU SEE LEADERSHIP. AND FOR THE CAMPUSES AS WELL A AS PART OF THAT WORK MY OFFICE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THE REPORT THAT THAT YOU SEE TODAY. UP I THINK UP PP I SEE NDRC CALIFORNIA COMPETES FOR THEIR. INFORMATION AND APPRECIATE THIS TIME TO HAVE THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION WE'VE BEEN HAVING SIMILAR DISCUSSIONS WITHIN THE UC SYSTEM AS WELL. A AYE ALONG WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE PROVOST OFFICE WITHIN ADMISSIONS AND DIVERSITY AND ENGAGEMENT HAVE MADE TO PRESENTATIONS TO THE BOARD OF REGENTS ABOUT THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT THAT MEANS IN TERMS OF OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS ARE WORK RELATED TO ENROLLMENT PLANNING AND OUR CAPITAL NEED. BUT IN ADDITION IN NOVEMBER CHAIR OF BOARD CHAIR KEY FOR HAD A REQUESTED THAT PP I SEIZE UP PRESIDENT MARK ABOUT THE SORRY AND DIRECTOR HANS JOHNSON. COME A PRESENT THE RESEARCH THAT THEY SHARED HERE TODAY WITH THE BOARD. SO THAT THEY WOULD UNDERSTAND THE WORKFORCE SKILLS GAP THAT IT'S A COMING UP. AND THEN IN JANUARY PRESIDENT. JANET THE PUBLIC TENDO ASKED YOU CO P. LEADERSHIP AND THE UC CHANCELLOR'S TO TAKE A LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THE PP I SEE CHALLENGE. A UC CHANCELLORS ARE TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO TO ADDRESS THE DEGREE GAP THAT. IS BEFORE US AND OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING EARLY ON IS THAT THE STRATEGIES THAT CAMPUSES MAY TAKE MAY VERY. IN SOME CASES SOME CAMPUSES ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT ESTABLISHING PARTNERSHIPS WITH. LOCAL UNIVERSITIES OR COLLEGES A IN THAT AREA THEY MAY BE LOOKING AT INCREASING OFF CAMPUS PARTICIPATION IN INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS LIKE YOU SEE DC OR ON YOU SEE SACRAMENTO'S CENTER OR A EDUCATION ABROAD. AS A WAY TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT AND ACCESS OF BUT ALSO TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL COSTS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO IT TO MANAGE THAT. OTHERS ARE GONNA BE PRIORITIZING EFFORTS TO INCREASE DEGREE PRODUCTION AND THAT'S IMPROVING GRADUATION RATES. REDUCING TIME TO DEGREE. IN SOME CASES IT MAY BE PROVIDING INCENTIVES FOR STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO GRADUATE IN THREE YEARS. SO WHATEVER THE CAMPUS STRATEGY IS THE OVERALL GOAL IS THE SAME TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF DEGREES THAT WERE ABLE TO PRODUCES A SYSTEM. BUT TURNING TO THE REPORT THAT WE PRODUCED IN THE SLIDES THAT WE HAVE THERE THE FIRST ONE THERE. IS THE PROPOSAL FOR WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO ACHIEVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. BACHELOR'S DEGREES THIS IS THE SAME ONE THAT WAS IN THE YOUR COMMITTEE REPORT. IT SHOWS THAT THE ANNUAL ENROLLMENT GROWTH THAT WE HAVE A GO FROM WHAT WE HAVE TODAY ABOUT ONE PERCENT. UP TO ALMOST FIVE PERCENT OVER AN EIGHT YEAR PERIOD THAT TRANSLATES TO ANNUAL GROWTH OF ABOUT TEN THOUSAND TO OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND A YEAR. IT REPRESENTS NOT ONLY UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH FOR THE UNIVERSITY BUT IT ALSO A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF STATE RESOURCES. IF WE ESTIMATE THAT ONE AT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH ADDITIONAL STUDENT IN THE OUT YEARS THAT WORKS OUT TO BE A ONE BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. ADJUST FOR ENROLLMENT FUNDING IF WE TOOK A LOOK AT WHAT OUR ESTIMATES ARE FOR CAL GRANT SUPPORT. THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION AND THEN KIERAN ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE CAPITAL COSTS THAT WE'VE ESTIMATED ASSOCIATED WITH IT SO TWO POINT FIVE TO. THREE BILLION AN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OUTLAY AND THAT'S ON TOP OF FIVE POINT SIX THAT WE HAVE ESTIMATED. AS NEED. FOR THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS. ANOTHER POINT THAT WE'D LIKE TO pMAGNITUDE FOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR A CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY COLLEAGUES TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THEIR PP I SEE GOALS. OF INCREASING THEIR ENROLLMENT BY IT DEGREES AWARDED BY AROUND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND. OF WE'D BE TAKING A LARGER PROPORTION OF THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFERS. THAT WOULD TRADITIONALLY GO TO YOU SEE. AND IT WOULD ALSO HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE MADE ON THEIR GRADUATION RATES WE RAISE THIS TO YOU BECAUSE WE BELIEVE AS YOU DO. THAT PUBLIC EDUCATION HIGHER HIGHER EDUCATION SEGMENTS AND THE INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE ALL GOING TO NEED TO COLLABORATE AND COORDINATE. TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN MAKE PROGRESS IN A CLOSING THIS DEGREE GAP AND MEETING THE STATE'S FUTURE WORKFORCE NEEDS. THERE'S ANOTHER A COMPONENT I DON'T WANNA LOSE SIGHT OF AND THAT'S THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES. A IF WE CONTINUE TO GROW UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES WE NEED TO ALSO INCREASE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE STUDENTS TO GET GRADUATE DEGREES. AND IF WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE SECOND SLIDE THIS PRESENT SOME INFORMATION THAT WE'VE A HAVE ON. AT THE PLANS AND THE ACTUAL IS FOR I'M STUDENTS GETTING GRADUATE DEGREES. OF OUR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT AROUND FORTY PERCENT OF UC'S UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS ASPIRE TO GET A GRADUATE DEGREE AND JUST OVER THIRTY FIVE PERCENT AND THAT DOING SO. WITH THE HIGHEST PERCENT OF UNDERGRADUATES WHO BOTH ASPIRE AND ACHIEVE TO GET A GRADUATE DEGREE BEING ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. SO WE'D LIKE TO ADVOCATE FOR AN APPROACH THAT WOULD INCORPORATE BOTH BACHELOR DEGREE AND GRADUATE DEGREE PRODUCTION IT ALIGNS WITH PP IC'S RESEARCH THAT CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST SKILL GAP ARE FOR JOBS THAT REQUIRE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR HIGHER. TO MEET THIS ONE POINT ONE MILLION IN ADDITIONAL DEGREES THE STATE IS GONNA NEED ADDITIONAL TEACHERS WITH MASTER'S AND PHD EASE. IN ADDITION PP I SEIZE IDENTIFIED GROWING FIELDS THAT WILL NEED DEGREE RECIPIENTS THAT REQUIRE MORE THAN A BACHELOR'S DEGREES. FIELDS LIKE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE WHERE YOU SEE PRODUCES OVER SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE STEM DOCTORAL DEGREES FOR THE STATE AND MORE THAN SIXTY PERCENT OF THE STATE'S GRADUATE MEDICAL. OF PROFESSIONAL DEGREES. YOU SEE GRADUATE STUDENTS PRODUCE RESEARCH TODAY THAT ADVANCES OUR ECONOMIC INDUSTRIES INCLUDING AGRICULTURE BIOTECHNOLOGY AND CLIMATE SCIENCE. THEY CREATE START UPS THAT PROMOTE JOB CREATION. AND TODAY'S GRADUATE STUDENTS ARE TAKING ON CHALLENGES IN PROVIDING HOPE FOR THE FUTURE. INCLUDING UC SANTA CRUZ SARAH ON SKITS AN EARTH SCIENCE GRADUATE STUDENT WHO IS LOOKING AT WAYS TO COLLECT WATER DURING FLOODS AND BE ABLE TO STORE THAT UNDERGROUND UNTIL THE NEXT DROUGHT. THEN THERE'S UCLA'S MACHEL KELLER A HEALTH POLICY GRADUATE STUDENT WHO'S ANALYZING BIG DATA TO SEE HOW DOCTORS PRESCRIBE. PRESCRIBED PAIN KILLERS. BUT TO HELP HEALTH SYSTEMS CUT DOWN ON A NEEDED OPIOID PRESCRIPTIONS AND FLAG THOSE AT RISK OF OPIOID ADDICTION. THOSE ARE JUST TWO EXAMPLES OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT GRADUATE STUDENTS ARE MAKING AND I MARCH TWENTY FIRST YOU'LL HOPEFULLY HERE FOR MORE DURING ARE YOU SEE GRADUATE RESEARCH STAY THE IN THE CAPITAL. WE PRODUCED AN ALTERNATE SCENARIO THAT WOULD BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND COLLABORATIVE AND STILL WOULD ENSURE THE STRENGTH OF CALIFORNIANS WORKFORCE AND THE STATE'S KNOWLEDGE BASED ECONOMY. IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT SLIDE THREE. THIS SHOWS A HEALTHY BUT MORE MODEST ENROLLMENT GROWTH JUST OVER ONE PERCENT A YEAR OR AN ANNUAL INCREASE OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED UNDERGRADUATES AND NINE HUNDRED GRADUATE STUDENTS BETWEEN NOW. AND TWENTY THIRTY. OUR INITIAL STE OTHER ESTIMATES SHOW IF YOU JUST DID THAT THAT WOULD INCREASE THE DEGREE PRODUCTION BY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND FOR THE STATE. THAT'S A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND BACHELOR'S DEGREES TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND GRADUATE DEGREES AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN MAKE UP SOME OF THAT PORTION OF THE BALANCE BY HIM WITH THE APPROPRIATE SUPPORT. FURTHER INCREASE OUR GRADUATION RATES. TODAY YOU SEE SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATES FOR OUR FRESHMAN IS EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT. THE FOUR YEAR RATE IS EIGHTY EIGHT PERCENT FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS THAT'S SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN ONE PP I SEE DID THE ORIGINAL REPORT. OVER THE DECADE WE'VE SEEN GREATER IMPROVEMENTS WITH A ARE YOU SEE FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE FOR FRESHMAN. THAT'S GONE UP EIGHT POINTS FROM FIFTY SIX TO SIXTY FOUR PERCENT AND THE TRANSFER TO RATE IT TO YOUR RATE HAS GONE UP FIVE POINTS FROM FIFTY ONE TO FIFTY SIX. WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR CAMPUSES TO SHARE RESEARCH AND LEARN FROM THEIR PROGRAMS AND STRATEGIES THAT THEY HAVE IN PLACE TO IMPROVE UNDERGRADUATE OUTCOMES AND EXPERIENCES. FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW THAT STUDENTS WHO HAVE A LOWER SENSE OF BELONGING HAVE LOWER GRADUATION RATES. UC IRVINE HAS A PROGRAM TO WELCOME THE THE NEW FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS ON THEIR CAMPUSES THEY HAVE THE FACULTY THAT WERE FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS THEMSELVES WEAR TEE SHIRTS SO THAT THEY CAN IDENTIFY THEMSELVES. AND THAT PROVIDES A WAY FOR THEM TO KNOW THAT THERE WERE OTHERS THAT THEY CAN TURN TO THAT MAY HAVE HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES. THEY ALSO SERVE AS MENTORS ON THE CAMPUS THAT PROGRAM WAS EXPANDED TO OTHER CAMPUSES AND THIS YEAR IT OPERATED ON ALL OF OF ARE YOU SEE UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES. A AND HAS SHOWN SOME POSITIVE OUTCOMES. UC BERKELEY HAS A FALL PROGRAM FOR FRESHMEN WHICH PROVIDES A SMALL COLLABORATIVE LEARNING COMMUNITIES. WITH ACCESS TO SMALLER GATEWAY COURSES AND ONE ON ONE ADVISING AND THAT'S SHOWN THAT PARTICIPANTS IN THAT PROGRAM HAVE SLIGHTLY HIGHER GRADUATION RATES THAN OTHER FRENCH FRESHMAN ENTRANCE. AND IT UC RIVERSIDE OF THAT INSTITUTION IS PARTICIPATING IN THE UNIVERSITY INNOVATION ALLIANCE A COLLABORATION WITH TEN OTHER. UNIVERSITIES THAT ARE STRIVING TO IMPROVE GRADUATION RATES AND IN THE LAST TWO YEARS IT'S FOUR YEAR GRADUATION RATE HAS INCREASED OVER NINE POINTS. FROM FORTYEIGHT FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT. IN ADDITION TO THAT RECENTLY COMPLETED CAMPUS EFFORTS TO REVIEW AND WHERE POSSIBLE REDUCE UPPER DIVISION MAJOR REQUIREMENTS FOR THE TOP SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT AND OF UNDERGRADUATE MAJORS. AND THE CREATION OF THREE YEAR DEGREE PATHWAYS FOR TOP MAJORS PATHWAYS THAT WOULD MAP OUT THE COURSE SEQUENCES THAT STUDENTS WOULD NEED TO TAKE EACH TERM AND ORDERED GRADUATE IN THREE YEARS. THOSE ARE TWO OTHER EXAMPLES OF WAYS THAT WHERE UMP WORKING ON TRYING TO POTENTIALLY REDUCE TIME TO CREATE. IF WE WERE ABLE TO MEET PEOPLE YEAH SEIZE GOAL OF NINETY TWO PERCENT OF A GRADUATION RATE. THAT WOULD ADD POTENTIALLY ANOTHER FIFTY THOUSAND DEGREES BRINGING THAT TOTAL THAT WE HAVE UNDER THE PROPOSAL A ON SLIDE THREE. JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. SLIDE FOUR HIGHLIGHTS THE OPPORTUNITIES AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN AND MEETING THAT GOAL. ON THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE PERCENTAGE OF NEW FRESHMEN THAT A PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS ALONG WITH THEIR GRADUATION RATES IT'S A DATA THAT WAS RELEASED. EARLY LAST END OF LAST YEAR AND IT SHOWS THIS INFORMATION FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITIES AND FOR THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN UNIVERSITY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS. WHAT THIS HIGHLIGHTS IS THAT OF THE UNIT THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE AT THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTIONS HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN PROVIDING UNPRECEDENTED ACCESS? TO LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND THAT'S IN LARGE PART THANKS TO THE SUPPORT OF THE CELTS AS STATES CAL GRANT PROGRAM AND INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT. CONTINUED IMPROVEMENTS IN THESE GRADUATION RATES FOR THE STUDENTS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE WE KNOW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THAT WITHIN FIVE YEARS OF GRADUATING THE MAJORITY OF PROGRAM RECIPIENTS GO ON TO EARN MORE THAN THEIR FAMILIES DID. AS THE STATE GRAPPLES WITH GROWING INCOME INEQUALITY INVESTMENTS IN EDUCATION CAN ADVANCE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY. AS WELL AS SUPPORTING THE STATE'S WORKFORCE NEEDS BUT WE NEED MORE SUPPORT TO ENSURE STUDENTS LIKE THESE ARE ABLE TO SUCCEED. THE FOUR YEAR GAP IN GRADUATION BETWEEN PALIN NAM PELL RECIPIENTS ON OUR CAMPUSES IS JUST OVER TEN POINTS. AND CURRENT STRATEGIES TO REDUCE THAT GAP INCLUDE SMALLER CLASSES GREATER USE OF TECHNOLOGY ACCESS TO SUMMER BRIDGE ANOTHER SUMMER PROGRAMS AN ADDITIONAL ADVISING A MENTORSHIP OPPORTUNITIES THAT REQUIRE GREATER INVESTMENT. TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO THESE LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND CONTINUED TO IMPROVE GRADUATION RATES ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT IS NEEDED STARTING WITH FULL STATE FUNDING FOR ENROLLMENT. AND EXPANSION OF GUILT CAL GRANT SUPPORT OVER THE SUMMER TO SUPPORT LOW INCOME STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND DURING THAT TIME. TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ON THE CAPITAL NEEDS IN THE CAMPUS PERSPECTIVE ON THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR VICE CHANCELLOR FOR FINANCE OPERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATION ON THE DAVIS CAMPUS. KELLY RATLIFF. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY SPEAK. ALL BE BRIEF AS MY COLLEAGUES NOTED WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO THINK AHEAD WITH YOU ABOUT HOW THE UNIVERSITY CAN CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE TO MEETING THE STATE'S WORKFORCE NEEDS. I'M ALL BE ADDRESSING THE CAPITAL MEANS ASSOCIATING. ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASING DEGREE PRODUCTION ALL FOCUS ON MY CAMPUS THE DAVIS CAMPUS. AND GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES I PROVIDED A LITTLE TWO PAGE HANDOUT. BUT FIRST LET ME MENTION OUR OUR RECENT CLAIM TO FAME. THAT'S SOMEWHAT COLORFUL REFERENCE TO UC DAVIS AND LADY BIRD THE OSCAR NOMINATED FILM BY THE SAME NAME. HE MIGHT KNOW IN THAT MOVIE LADY BIRD. ADMONISHES THE PROSPECTS OF ATTENDING THAT BLEEP UNIVERSITY OF FAMOUS FOR ITS BLEEP AGRICULTURAL SCHOOL. AND YOU KNOW IT IF IT'S A FAIR REFERENCE WERE NUMBER ONE IN AGONY AND NATION NUMBER TWO IN THE WORLD. BUT OF COURSE YOU SEE DAVIS'S IS MUCH MORE. THIS HALLWAY AND ROLLED OVER THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND STUDENTS INCLUDING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATES OF THE HIGHEST IN THE UC SYSTEM. AND ANOTHER SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED GRADUATE PROFESSIONAL STUDENTS ACROSS FOR COLLEGES AND SIX PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. AS IS THE CASE FOR ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES WE'VE HAD A TREMENDOUS PERIOD OF GROWTH LAST TEN YEARS UC DAVIS IS IN ROWING TWENTY SIX PERCENT MORE STUDENTS COMPARED TO FALL TWO THOUSAND EIGHT JUST TEN YEARS. AND THAT GROWTH AND OUR CAMPUS HAS BEEN GUIDED BY A TWENTY TWENTY PLAN HOME WHERE IN ADDITION TO GROWING CALIFORNIAN ROMANS WE ALSO INCREASED PROPORTIONATE NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS. BUT THAT PLAN HAD MANY GOALS BUT PRIMARY AMONGST IT WAS OUR ABILITY CREATING FUNDING TO INVESTING CAPITAL. AS WE TURN TO CAPITAL JUST A BIT MORE. CONTEXT FOR UC DAVIS WE HAVE OVER FIFTY THREE HUNDRED ACRES. AND NEARLY TWELVE HUNDRED BUILDINGS COMPRISING FOURTEEN MILLION SQUARE FEET AND HUNDRED THIRTY MILES OF INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S IN DAVIS IN ADDITION HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE ACRES WAS SEVENTY BUILDINGS. AND WE HAVE ADDITIONAL FACILITIES THAT SUPPORT TEACHING AND RESEARCH IN PLACES LIKE BUT DEGARR TAHOE A TO NAME A FEW. SO IF WE IF WE THINK ABOUT GROWTH I WANNA FIRST CONSIDER CLASSROOMS THAT'S AN OBVIOUS IN CRITICAL NEED FOR ACCOMMODATING STUDENT GROWTH. AND JUST TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OUR BASE SCENARIO. WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF A SIX YEAR PROGRAM. THAT'S RENOVATING OUR EXISTING HUNDRED THIRTY CLASSROOMS. WEARE INVESTING A TOTAL OF TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OVER THE SIX YEARS TO DO FLOOR TO CEILING RENOVATIONS TO IMPLODE PROVE THE STUDENT LEARNING EXPERIENCE. OTHERS THERE'S A COUPLE OF PHOTOS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FIRST PAGE OF THE HANDOUT. SO WHEN WE GO IN AND DO THESE. PROGRAMS WERE TAKING CARE OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR REPLACING OUTDATED TECHNOLOGY WERE PROVIDING SOME FLEXIBLE SEATING AND AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS TO SUPPORT. A MODERN INSTRUCTION. APPROACH FOR USING IS TAKING. ABOUT EIGHT TO TWELVE CLASSROOMS EACH SUMMER TO DO THIS FULL RENOVATION AND IT'S HAD EXCELLENT SUCCESS. BUT WE NEED A MECHANISM TO SUSTAIN IT. IN ADDITION TO CARING FOR THE EXISTING CLASSROOMS. ENROLLMENT GROWTH CREATES THE NEED FOR NEW SEATS. AND TEACHING LABORATORIES AND IF YOU'RE CAMPUS LIKE UC DAVIS ANIMAL SCIENCE TEACHING. SO WE'RE DELIVERING HERE TO WERE ADDING OVER FOUR THOUSAND SEATS AND SEVEN FACILITIES. TO CATCH UP TO THE GROWTH WAS EXPERIENCED AND TO SUPPORT MORE INTERACTIVE TEACHING. THE NEW BUILDINGS ARE REQUIRING INVESTMENTS TOTALLING OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION THAT'S BEYOND THE RENOVATION PROGRAM. SO THAT WE CAN MEET OUR TWENTY TWENTY PLAN. ANY ADDITIONAL GROWTH THAT SUGGESTED BY THAT PP I SEE PLAN WOULD REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL. INVESTMENT BEYOND THAT. ANOTHER CATEGORY OF CRITICAL NEED ARE LABORATORIES FOR RESEARCH AND TEACHING. SO CHAIRMAN OFFER CHEMISTRY AS A CASE STUDY. OR TOP RANKED RESEARCH UNIVERSITY FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE UNDERGRADUATES AT UC DAVIS ARE IN STEM FIELDS. AND THAT WERE LEADERS AND DISCOVERY AND INNOVATION ACROSS THE WORLD. STEM OF COURSE REQUIRES SPECIALIZED TEACHING FACILITIES. WE HAVE A HUNDRED PLUS WET AND DRY LABS SUPPORTING INSTRUCTION AT UC DAVIS WITH CLASSES RUNNING FAR INTO THE EVENING FOR MANY OF OUR HIGH DEMAND COURSES. YEAH OUR CHEMISTRY BUILDING BUILT IN NINETEEN SIXTY SIX HAS NEVER HAD A FULL RENOVATION. PROGRAMS OF TRIMMING. PART ME CHANGED DRAMATICALLY IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS. THE INFRASTRUCTURE THE BUILDING IS LAGGING FAR BEHIND. AND OF COURSE WHEN A BUSY CROWDED TWENTY FOUR SEVEN RESEARCH AND TEACHING FACILITY. SO WE DEVELOPED A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO RENOVATE THE CHEMISTRY BUILDING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. AND OF COURSE THAT WAS THAT THE STRIKE THE START OF THE FUNDING CRISIS AND SO WE HAD TO SHELVE THAT PLAN. WE PULLED BACK OUT TWENTY FOURTEEN WE WORKED ON UP A REVISION OF THE PLAN TO INCREASE CAPACITY OF THE EXISTING SPACE BY TWENTY PERCENT. USING AN OPEN MODULAR LAP CONCEPT. THE STATUS TODAY. WE'RE USING GENERAL FUND FINANCING TO ADVANCE THIRTY FIVE MILLION UPSIDES AT THE LIFE SAFETY. WERE ALSO INVESTING FIFTY FOUR MILLION FROM CAMPUS FUNDS TO ADDRESS CRITICAL EXHAUST AND ELECTRICAL CAPACITY NEEDS WERE CONSTRUCTING A SMALL ADDITION TO GET DESKS AND FACULTY AND RESEARCHERS RESEARCHERS OUT OF LABS. AND INTO OFFICE SPACE. AND WE'RE RENOVATING ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THAT CHEMISTRY BUILDING. TO DO THE WHOLE THING WE NEED ANOTHER ELEVEN MILLION FOR A SECOND PHASE. OF. WORK THAT WE'RE POSTPONING AND THEN WE HAVE PHASES AND AN ADDITIONAL THREE PHASES THAT WOULD TOTAL ANOTHER HUNDRED FORTY MILLION. TO. RENOVATE THE WHOLE BUILDING. WE HAVE TO PHASE BECAUSE WHEN THESE ARE ACTIVE SPACES AND SO IN ORDER TO AVOID DISRUPTION AND MOVE FOLKS IN AND OUT IT TAKES THIS PHASED APPROACH. BUT. THE SUBSEQUENT PHASES I'M MENTIONING THEY'RE NOT SCHEDULED BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT FUNDED. AND SO WE'RE GONNA GET THROUGH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PROGRESS IN AND THEN WE'LL BE BACK PROBABLY IN A LAP BY LAP BRAND OF PATIENT MODE. THE STORY OF CHEMISTRY IT'S REPEATING AND ANOTHER SIX BUILDINGS COMPRISING. A HALF MILLION SQUARE FEET THAT WERE BUILT IN THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES WE HAVE LARGE BUILDINGS WHERE WE COULD DO MORE ABOUT BUT WITHOUT. PLANNING FUNDING THAT WE CAN COUNT ON AND PLANNED FOR IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO EXECUTE ON THESE PLANS. SO I'LL ALL END WITH THE OBSERVATION THAT UC DAVIS WE HAVE A VISION WE HAVE PLANS AND WE HAVE GOOD FOLKS DOING GOOD WORK. TO BE SUCCESSFUL WHEN HE PARTNERSHIP AND WE NEED STABLE AND PREDICTABLE CAPITAL FUNDING. AND WE'RE GOING TO DO ANYTHING ALONG THE LINES I HAVE ADVANCING THE PP I SEE GOALS MEETS TALK ABOUT THAT CAPITAL FUNDING. UP FRONT SO THAT WE REALLY CAN EXECUTE AND HAVE THOSE FACILITIES AVAILABLE AS THE STUDENTS ARRIVE. THANK YOU. QUESTION. THE CHECK SHARE. I HAVE A QUESTION. REFERRING TO SLIDE ONE. THAT YOU HANDED OUT HERE YOU HAVE THE THE THIRD BULLET POINT ESTIMATED GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION INCREASE OF ONE BILLION A YEAR FOR INVOLVEMENT. WAS. WHAT WHAT IS THE CURRENT? GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION FOR ENROLLMENT. I THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO THAT CURRENT GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION FOR THE UNIVERSITY IS. A LITTLE BIT OVER THREE POINT FOUR BILLION. THAT UNIVERSITY RECEIVES. TO PRIMARY SOURCES OF FUNDS FOR WHAT WE CALL OUR CORE BUDGET ABOUT STATE GENERAL FUND THAT I JUST REFERENCED AND THEN. TUITION AS WELL AYE THERE ARE SOME OTHER. FUNDS THAT GOING TO YOU SEE WHAT WE CALL YOU SEE GENERAL FUND SOME PATENT INCOME THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. ABOUT THAT THAT CONSTITUTES OUR COURT BUDGET AND THAT IS WHAT WE EXPAND FROM FOR OUR AYE INSTRUCTION. AND RESEARCH PURPOSES SO SO IN OTHER WORDS IN ORDER TO. ACCOMPLISH A. THE TO A FIFTY THOUSAND MORE BACHELOR'S DEGREES BY TWENTY THIRTY WE WILL HAVE TO INCREASE THE. BY BYE ALMOST TOOK. BUT MORE THAN A THIRD. MORE THAN THIRTY PERCENT. YEAR FOR ENROLLMENT. SO OUR ESTIMATE IS THAT. AND ACHIEVING THAT AMOUNT OF ENROLLMENT IT WOULD TAKE. AT BILLION ADDITIONAL AS A BASE ON GOING. BUDGET THAT I. ADDITIONAL AYE AYE AUGMENTATION ARE BASED ON GOING BUDGET YES SO BASED ON AND. WHAT WE CALL I'D A STATE CHAIR MARGINAL COST OF INSTRUCTION IF WE ESTIMATE THAT WE'RE EXPANDING ABOUT? TWENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO EDUCATE A STUDENT. ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND OF THAT AMOUNT IS I SPENT FOR FINANCIAL AID PURPOSES. WHICH BRINGS US DOWN TO AROUND THAT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN RANGE. IF ABOUT THIRTEEN OR SO. OF THAT OF THOSE DOLLARS ARE ARE COMING IN FROM. STUDENTS TO ASH AND. THE BALANCE IS WHAT WE CONSIDERED TO BE A STATE CHAIR ROCK COMBINED WITH TUITION AND. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THAT CUMULATIVE INCREASE IN ENROLLMENT OF A HUNDRED AND SIX THOUSAND YOU ASSUME THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT THAT GETS YOU OUT TO UP MOUNT. OKAY SO. BUT OF THE THREE POINT FOUR BILLION IN THE CURRENT GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION AND NOT ALL OF THAT IS GOING TOWARD ENROLLMENT CURRENT. THAT'S CORRECT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF IT THAT IT'S GOING FOR CAPITAL FOR. FINANCING FOR CAPITAL PURPOSES. AND I THINK. PROBABLY. PAMELA MIGHT BE ABLE TO TELL US AYE HOW MUCH OF OUR EXPAND. FOR FACULTY SALARIES FOR STAFF SALARIES IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO. STATE GENERAL FUND. WHO? ACTUALLY I HAVE YET WE WE DON'T HAVE TO GO INTO THAT IN DETAIL NOW I AM JUST TRYING TO GET A. YOU KNOW I GOT A. IN OVER A REALITY CHECK HERE OF HOW MUCH MORE MONEY. WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THE TO INVADE THOUSAND MORE BACHELOR'S DEGREES. THIS IS SO SO THE ONE BILLION A YEAR OF THAT. THAT WOULD BE THAT THAT THAT BASICALLY ONE BILLION IN ADDITIONAL CHAU OFF AN APPROPRIATION TO INCLUDE ENROLLMENT AS WELL AS. CAPITAL OUTLAY. NO CAP THE CAPITAL OUTLAY WOULD BE SEPARATE SO I WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ENROLLMENT GROWTH WE GENERALLY TRY AND USE. BASICALLY AIR RIGHT. IN AMOUNTS THAT. WE ATTRIBUTE APPORTIONED IT TUITION AND A PORTION TO STATE CONTRIBUTION. TO ADDRESS WHAT IT COST TO EDUCATE ONE ADDITIONAL NEW STUDENT ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AND THAT'S WHERE WE COME UP WITH THE E. TEN THOUSAND PER STATE STUDENT AS SORT OF A HISTORICAL STATE SHARE. THAT'S BEEN PROVIDED SO FOR INSTANCE WHEN THE YOM. STATE PROVIDED ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING RECENTLY FOR AYE GRADUATE STUDENTS I BELIEVE WE LANDED ON SIX HUNDRED GRADUATE STUDENT ENROLLMENT GROWTH FOR SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN THAT BUDGET THERE WAS. A COUPLE DIFFERENT GOING ON BUT THAT WOULD BE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT. AND THAT'S WHY WITH THE OTHER PROPOSAL THAT WE'VE PROVIDED WHICH HAS BOTH GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE GROWTH. THAT WE CALL THAT A MORE MODEST PROPOSAL IT STILL WOULD REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT. OUTLAY IN FUNDS IT BE ABOUT HALF OF WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED IF WE JUST DID A. pTHERE. AND OUR OUR FEELING ABOUT SOMETHING ALONG THIS PRO APPROACH BY LOOKING AT GRADUATE STUDENTS IN ADDITION TO UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS AT BOTH SUPPORTS THE EDUCATION OF THE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. IT MEETS THE WORK FORCE THEN AND ECONOMIC NEEDS OF THE STATE MOVING AHEAD. AND. OF WOULD HAVE A BETTER BALANCE FOR US AS WE LOOKED AHEAD. SO IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE FOR THE ALTERNATE SCENARIO. OF HOW MUCH MORE OF A GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION INCREASE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT SO IT'S ABOUT HALF OF. WHAT WOULD BE REQUIRED UNDER THERE SO AROUND ON FIVE HUNDRED MILLION HEALTH? I THINK IT. I LIKE THAT ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THE A PROPOSAL. OF INCREASING. THE. PERCENTAGE OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES SO IN THE MASTER PLAN THE NINETEEN SIXTY. MASTER PLAN WHAT WE'RE IT TWELVE POINT FIVE CRACKED. WE HEARD TESTIMONY THAT. GOING TO SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE. WOULD INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF STUDENTS AND ALSO ADDRESS. MORE OF THE SOCIO ECONOMIC DISPARITY. OF OF STUDENTS. CAN YOU COMMENT ON. MOVING THE THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES US SO IF WE LOOK AT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS THE LARGEST. GROWING POPULATION OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS ARE CHICANO LATINOS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE UNDER EITHER THE PROPOSALS AND THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY. THE FIRST PROPOSAL THE ONE WITH BACHELOR'S ONLY FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND THAT. ASSUMES THAT WE WOULD GO FROM ABOUT TWELVE AND A HALF TO SEVENTEEN PERCENT A AND. EH AGAIN IT WOULD INCREASE A YEAR THAT AS WE LOOK AT THE HIGH SCHOOL POPULATION GOING THROUGH ITS BECOMING INCREASINGLY DIVERSE. SO YOU BE PULLING AND. THAT A UNDER UP EITHER PROPOSAL IT'S JUST THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THAT YOU BE BRINGING AN. CAN CAN YOU ALSO COMMENT ON. WHAT IS OUR PROGRESS ON THE STATUS OF THE TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN TRANSFERRED TASK FORCE? BUT SO DID THE TRANSFER TASK FORCE UPRAVO SPENT BROWN. WHO BEGAN LAST YEAR IS THAT GONNA BE IN CHARGE OF THAT? THEY ARE LOOKING AT OF VARIOUS PROPOSALS OF ON THE THINGS THAT WOULD HELP IMPROVE WE'VE GOT THE. TWENTY ONE TRANSFER PATHWAYS THAT ARE IN PLACE THAT PROVIDE CONSISTENT A REQUIREMENTS ACROSS EACH OF THE CAMPUSES SO IT'S. WORKING TO PROVIDE SOME CONSISTENCY FOR STUDENTS THAT IF THEY CHOOSE THAT THEY CAN GO TO ANY OF THE UC CAMPUSES THAT WE HAVE SO WE HAVE THAT. IN PLACE AND WERE LOOKING AT PROVIDING MORE INFORMATION AND OUTREACH SO THAT STUDENTS KNOW THAT'S AVAILABLE. AS IT GOES FOR THE TRANSFER. TASK FORCE OF THEY'RE GOING TO BE. TAKING A LOOK AT THE A PILOT PROJECT ON THAT IS GOING TO. THAT THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE EIGHT EIGHT DEGREES FOR CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS THE FACULTY ON A BOTH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO SEE IF THEY CAN PROVIDE SOME GUARANTEED ADMISSIONS PROGRAM THERE THAT WORK IS UNDER WAY. AND THERE IS A ALSO DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE ABOUT INCREASING TAG AGREEMENTS. A TRANSFER ADMISSION GUARANTEE AGREEMENTS WE HAVE MONTHS SIX OF THE CAMPUSES A ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR ENROLLMENT. IS WITH STUDENTS THAT COME UP WITH THROUGH THE TAG PROGRAM. A AND SO THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT THOSE TWO. THE CHANCELLOR I MEAN THE PUBLIC JUST GOT HERE AND. HE IS. CHAIRING THAT TASK FORCE SO THAT WORK IS UNDER WAY. AND. WILL BE ABLE TO UPDATE YOU AS SICK PROCEEDS. AND AS WE TALK ABOUT TRANSFER STUDENTS AND A COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THE PORTENTS OF THAT. IN THE LARGE LATINO POPULATION THAT ARE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AYE I'D LIKE TO HEAR. THE COMMENT ON A PROGRAM SUCH AS POINT THEY. THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN BOTH AS A MENTOR. HOW EFFECTIVE? DO YOU SEE PROGRAMS LIKE THAT AND YOU TALKED ABOUT BELONGINGNESS. ON THE CAMPUS YET IMPORTANCE OF THAT YET. BUT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE IN TRYING TO QUICKLY GO TO. ARE YOU SEE INFORMATION CENTER FROM WE HAVE A INFORMATION UP THERE THAT SHOWS THE OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS THAT PARTICIPATE IN THOSE PROGRAMS. AND I KNOW THAT IT'S A BEEN POSITIVE I I'M NOT SURE I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO GET THIS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE I LIKE A FIVE SECOND DELAY HERE. YEAH. OF LET'S SEE SO FOR POINT TODAY I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD. A GOOD BENEFITS IN BOTH BUT GETTING STUDENTS TO ENROLL AND THEN. BE PREPARED. AND SO. BUT IF I CAN GIVE YOU SPECIFICS AYE WELL BUT BUT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THEY. THAT KIND OF MENTORSHIP AND OUTREACH IS REALLY CRITICAL. TO GET PEOPLE TO CHOOSE. AT THE UNIVERSITY AND THAT WE'VE SEEN GROWTH AND IN INDIVIDUALS THAT I HAVE A PARTICIPATED IN THAT PROGRAM. OF THAT END UP COMING UP AND. AND THAT KIND OF CONNECTION IS REALLY CRITICAL. I'M NOT GETTING THE NUMBERS AS FAST AS I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE IT BUT WE DO HAVE SOME INFORMATION THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH YOU. THERE WOULD BE SPECIFIC OTHER THAT THAT FIRST YEAR EXPERIENCE. THE INTRODUCTION TO THE CAMPUSES WE KNOW THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL IN AND CAMPUSES ARE DOING A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. TO PROVIDE. STUDENTS A. SMOOTH TRANSITIONS NAM AND THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO. GET THROUGH THAT FIRST YEAR AND THEN SUCCEEDED BY MOVEON. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SELECT THE HAVE. OKAY WILL BRING GET NOW THE CSU SYSTEM AND AND AS YOU KNOW WHERE OUT RUNNING OUT OF TIME SO IF YOU COULD HELP US. MOVING ALONG SO WE GET TO THE. COMMENTARY PIECE OF THE GREAT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. I'M LAUREN BLANCHARD I SERVE AS EXECUTIVE VICE CHANCELLOR FOR ACADEMIC AND STUDENT AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CHANCES OFFICE. AND SEATED NEXT TO ME IS STEVE REALLY GAY WHO SERVES AS EXECUTIVE VICE CHANCELLOR OF FOR BUSINESS AND FINANCE FOR THE CHANCES OFFICE AND WE'RE BOTH. OF VERY PLEASED TO BE WITH YOU TODAY TO DISCUSS THE ACTIONS THAT THE C. ISSUE WITH TAKING. TO IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS AND DEGREE COMPLETION FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR STUDENTS BUT THEIR FAMILIES AND OBVIOUSLY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO WILL TAKE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING AROUND STUDENT SUCCESS. THE C. S. USE ROLE IN CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION FRAMEWORK IN THE ROLE OF THE YOU SEE AND THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN IT IS TODAY. IN THE CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMY MORE STUDENTS NEEDED AGREE ARE CREDENTIALED BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL AS THE NECESSARY PATHWAY FOR A CAREER. THIS SHIFT ALSO COINCIDES WITH THAT RISING DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE'S POPULATION AND LIKEWISE OUR STUDENTS AT THE CSU. AND HAVE AND AS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED ALREADY HERE TODAY. CALIFORNIA FACES A LOOMING DEGREE DROUGHT THE STATUS QUO IS INSUFFICIENT FOR STUDENTS FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND FOR OUR STATE. THAT IS WHY SEE IT'S YOU HAS LAUNCHED WHAT WE CLAIM AS OUR MOON SHOT. GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THROUGH THIS INITIATIVE THE CS YOU WILL ENSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. GRADUATE IN A TIMELY MANNER. POSITIVELY IMPACTING THEIR LIVES FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITIES. AND IN DOING SO THE CSU WILL CONTINUE TO FULFILL ITS FOUNDING MISSION TO PROVIDE AND PRODUCE THE GRADUATES NEED IT'S TO POWER CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE PROSPERITY. GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS DESIGNED TO BENEFIT EVERY CSU STUDENT. THOSE CURRENTLY NROLLED A MAC TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES AND THOSE TO COME. BUT WHILE EVERY STUDENT WILL BENEFIT FROM THE COLLECTIVE EFFORT DRIVING THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. THE CSU IS SPECIFICALLY MEASURING PROGRESS BASED ON SIX SYSTEM WIDE GOALS. THEY ARE. A FORTY PERCENT FOR YOUR GRADUATE FRESHMAN GRADUATION RATE. WHICH MORE THAN DOUBLES THE PERCENTAGE AND NUMBER OF STUDENTS ON THAT TIME LINE OVER THE COURSE OF THE INITIATIVE. A SEVENTY PERCENT SIX YEAR FRESHMAN GRADUATION RATE. A FORTY FIVE PERCENT TO YEAR TRANSFER GRADUATION RATE. AND EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT FOUR YEAR TRANSFER GRADUATION RATE. THE ELIMINATION OF THE THE GRADUATION RATE GAP BETWEEN PELL ELIGIBLE STUDENTS AND THEIR PEERS. AND THE ELIMINATION OF THE GRADUATION RATE GAP BETWEEN UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY STUDENTS AND THEIR PEERS. THESE TARGETS THAT I JUST DESCRIBED WERE NOT JUST GUESSES ARE UNREALISTIC HYPERBOLE. RATHER THEY WERE DATA INFORMED AND DEVELOPED BY AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE COMMITTEE THAT INCLUDED C. S. U. TRUSTEES ADMINISTRATORS FACULTY AND STUDENTS. AND BENEFIT FROM THE IMPACT OF THE EXPERTS THAT WE HEARD EARLIER TODAY. INCLUDING DOCTOR HANS JOHNSON FROM THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTITUTE OF CALIFORNIA AND DOCTOR LANDET A JOSIE FROM CALIFORNIA COMPETES. THE C. S. YOU CURRENTLY AWARDS NEARLY HALF OF THE STATE'S BACHELORS DEGREES. WITH SUFFICIENT ANNUAL INVESTMENT OF NEW GENERAL FUNDS TO GROW ENROLLMENT AND SUPPORT STUDENT SUCCESS. GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE PUTS THE CSU ON TRACK TO GRADUATE AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS BY THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. POSITIONING THE STUDENT. POSITIONING THE STATE TO MEET OUR SHARE OF CALIFORNIA'S PROJECTED WORKFORCE NEED. ACHIEVING THESE AMBITIOUS GOALS. WILL REQUIRE THE ENTIRE CSU COMMUNITY TO BE ENGAGED AND WORKING TOWARD THIS COMMON OBJECTIVE. AND I'M PLEASED TO SAY THAT THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS OCCURRING. ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES HAVE DEVELOPED AND ARE IMPLEMENTING THEIR OWN LOCAL PLANS TO ACHIEVE CAMPUS GOALS FOR COMPLETION AND EQUITY. EACH THE ISSUE CAMPUS HAS ITS OWN NUMERIC GOALS FOR IMPROVEMENT. AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS ASSESSING PROGRESS WITH EACH GRADUATING CLASS. AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL AS YOU HEARD ME SMIDGEN EARLIER WE HAVE DEVELOPED SIX OPERATIONAL PILLARS THAT ARE DRIVING OUR WORK THESE PLANTS ARE BUILT ON. STUDENT OUTCOME DATA RESEARCH AND BEST PRACTICES FROM ACROSS THE SEA IT'S YOU AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE TACTICS THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND AS I WAS SHARE LATER WE ARE ALREADY BEGINNING TO SEE THEIR IMPACTS. BUT FIRST LET ME JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO DELVE DEEPER IN TO THE WORK THAT IS UNDER WAY TO ACHIEVE OUR GRADUATION INITIATIVE CALLS. THE FIRST AREA THAT IS THE CAMPUS STRATEGIC A PRIORITY IS ACADEMIC PREPARATION. THE CSU WILL PROVIDE STUDENTS INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARRIVE ACADEMICALLY UNDERPREPARED. THE OPPORTUNITY AND SUPPORT NEEDED TO COMPLETE THIRTY DEGREE. COLLEGE LEVEL SEMESTER UNITS BEFORE BEGINNING THEIR SECOND ACADEMIC YEAR. IN RECENT YEARS MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND INCOMING FIRST YEAR STUDENTS. ARE INFORMED THAT THEY ARE NOT QUITE READY FOR COLLEGE LEVEL MATH OR ENGLISH COURSE WORK AFTER BEING FULLY ADMISSIBLE TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. NEARLY SIXTY PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HALF OF HISPANIC STUDENTS RECEIVE THAT MESSAGE. OF THESE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND STUDENTS ONE IN FOUR WILL NOT RETURN FOR THEIR SECOND YEAR. ONLY TEN PERCENT WILL GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS. AND LESS THAN HALF WILL GRADUATE IN SIX YEARS. THAT IS WHY THE CSU ENACTED THE SYSTEM WIDE POLICY CHANGES AIMED AT. IMPROVING ASSESSMENT OF COLLEGE READINESS. STRENGTHENING THE EARLY START PROGRAM RESTRUCTURING DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION AND CLARIFYING IN UPDATING GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS PROVIDING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TRAINING AND SUPPORT TO FACULTY AND ADMINISTRATORS TO IMPLEMENT THESE POLICY CHANGES. REALLOCATE IT TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO CAPS IS FROM ONE TIME SOURCES. AND WE HAVE SOUGHT PHILLIP THAT THROBBING SUPPORT WITH ORGANIZATIONS WHOSE EMPHASIS ON EDUCATIONAL EQUITY ALIGNED WITH OUR CSU VALUES. FACULTY AND STAFF. ARE CURRENTLY REDESIGNING COURSES. IMPLEMENTING MODELS SUCH AS CO REQUISITE THAT YOU HEARD EARLIER MENTIONED EARLIER THIS MORNING WHERE ACADEMIC SUPPORT IS IMBEDDED INTO CREDIT EARNING COURSES. BEGINNING IN FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALL CSU STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO BEGIN EARNING COLLEGE CREDIT BEGINNING THEIR FIRST DAY OF ON CAMPUS. WHILE RECEIVING THE ADDITIONAL ACADEMIC SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED. THIS WILL PLAY A TREMENDOUS ROLE IN IMPROVING STUDENT PERSISTENCE AND DEGREE COMPLETION AND MOST IMPORTANTLY ENCLOSING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. THE SECOND AREA OF FOCUS FOR THE SEE IT'S YOU IT'S IT'S UNDER THE ARM OF ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT. THE C. S. YOU WILL ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE ABLE TO IN A ROW ENROLLED IN THECOURSES THAT THEY NED WHEN THEY NEED THEM. THIS INCLUDES THE HIRING OF ADDITIONAL TENURE TRACK FACULTY TO TEACH ADDITIONAL COURSE SECTIONS WHICH STEVE WILL SPEAK ABOUT SHORTLY. BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES STRATEGIES SUCH AS REPEAT CREATING AND% REFINING DEGREE ROAD MAPS FOR STUDENTS. FOR EXAMPLE CSU SAN MARCOS HAS IMPLEMENTED DEGREE SET GO. AN INITIATIVE THAT ALLOW STUDENTS TO SEE THEIR MOST EFFICIENT ROADMAP TO GRADUATION. STUDENTS CAN REGISTER FOR CLASSES DIRECTLY FROM THE DEGREE PLAN OR PROGRAM AND THE CAMPUS IS ABLE TO USE THE INFORMATION TO BETTER PREDICT COURSE DEMAND AND MATCH RESOURCES. CAMPUSES ARE ALSO STRATEGICALLY OFFERING COURSES IN WINTER AND SPRING INTERCESSION AND IN THE SUMMER SESSION TO PROVIDE STUDENTS ADDITIONAL OF OPPORTUNITIES TO ENROLL IN THE CLASSES THEY NEED FOR GRADUATION. TO EITHER GET THEM BACK ON TRACK OR TO GET THEM AHEAD IN THEIR TIME TO DEGREE COMPLETION. THE THIRD AREA IS STUDENT ENGAGEMENT AND WELL BEING. YOU HEARD THAT'S THIS REFERENCED EARLIER WELL WHERE THE CSU WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE WELL BEING OF ALL CSU STUDENTS WHILE FOSTERING A STRONG SENSE OF BELONGING THIS ON CAMPUS. MORE THAN TWO THIRDS OF OUR C. ISSUE CAMPUSES NOW HAVE DREAM CENTERS. ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES HAVE FOOD PRINT PANTRIES ARE FOOD DISTRIBUTION PROGRAMS TO HELP STUDENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH FOOD SECURITY. A NUMBER OF CAMPUSES ASSIST STUDENTS WITH CAL PRESS APPLICATIONS ARE PROVIDES SHORT SHORT TERM EMERGENCY HOUSING ON CAMPUSES. IN FACT THIS WEEK. REPRESENTATIVES FROM ALL TWENTY THREE CAMPUSES STARTING TOMORROW WILL BE ATTENDING ACS YOU BASIC NEEDS CONFERENCE WHERE THEY WILL BE SHARING BEST PRACTICES AND LEARNING ADDITIONAL WAYS TO SUPPORT STUDENTS WELL BEING. THE FOURTH AREA ITS FINANCIAL SUPPORT. SEE IT SHE WILL ENSURE THAT FINANCIAL NEED DOES NOT IMPEDE STUDENT SUCCESS. MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS HAVE ALL TUITION COVERED BY NON LOAN EIGHT. BUT BEYOND TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL AID CAMPUSES ARE PROVIDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS TO STAY AND ROLLED AND TO STAY ON TRACK TO GRADUATE. FOR EXAMPLE AT FRESNO STATE MICRO GRANTS ARE AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS WHO ARE ON TRACK TO GRADUATE. BUT MIGHT FACE UNEXPECTED FINANCIAL CHALLENGES. AT SACRAMENTO STATE STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN THE FINISH IN FOUR. AND THE THROUGH INTO PROGRAMS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR UP TO ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DISCOUNTED COURSES TO ASSIST IN COMPLETING THIRTY EIGHT DEGREE CREDIT HOURS EACH YEAR. THE FIFTH AREA ITS DATA DRIVEN DECISION MAKING. THE CSU WILL USE DATA RICH EVIDENCE TO IDENTIFY AND ADVANCE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ACADEMIC SUPPORT PROGRAMS. AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL WE ARE COMPILING STUDENT OUTCOME DATA. STEALING IT AND PROVIDING IT IN ACTIONABLE FORMS FOUR CAMPUSES. FOR EXAMPLE THE FACULTY DASHBOARD PROVIDE CSU FACULTY WITH THE DATA ON STUDENTS WHO COMPRISE THEIR MAJORS ALLOWING THEM TO SEE WHICH COURSES STUDENTS ARE STRUGGLING WITH. WHERE THERE ARE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS IN COURSE PERFORMANCE AND IF STUDENTS ARE ON TRACK FOR EARNING A DEGREE? AND AT CAL STATE FULLERTON DATA ARE USED TO IDENTIFY COURSES THAT ARE SLOWING STUDENTS PROGRESS TO GRADUATION. DRIVE CLASS DRIVING CLASS SCHEDULING AND EXPANDING SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION WHERE IT WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE. AND FINALLY THIS SIXTH AREA IS ADMINISTRATIVE BARRIERS WHERE WE ARE IDENTIFYING AND REMOVING ADMINISTRATIVE IMPEDIMENTS TO GRADUATION. AS BUT ONE EXAMPLE SAN DIEGO STATE IS CHANGING ITS CLASS REGISTRATION PROCESS MOVING REGISTRATION EARLIER. BEGINNING WITH THE FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN SEMESTER THIS CHANGE WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR STUDENTS TO MEET WITH ADVISORS AND DEVELOP ACADEMIC SCHEDULES DURING CRITICAL PRE REGISTRATION PERIODS. THE STRATEGIES THAT I'VE JUST DESCRIBED BOTH CAMPUS BASED AND SYSTEM WIDE ARE ALREADY HAVING A MEASURABLE IMPACT ON CSU STUDENTS. THIS PAST YEAR TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THE STATE INVESTED THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING IN THE C. ISSUES STUDENT SUCCESS EFFORTS. I AM PROUD TO STATE THAT A LITTLE MORE THAN ONE YEAR INTO GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. OUR STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALREADY SEEING A STRONG RETURN ON THAT INVESTMENT. NEARLY NINETY NINE THOUSAND CSU STUDENTS ARE AND THEIR BACHELORS DEGREE THIS PAST YEAR. THIS REPRESENTS AN ALL TIME HIGH FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. WITH AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN THOUSAND STUDENTS CROSSING THAT COMMENCEMENT STAGE COMPARED TO LAST YEAR. AND SOME CAMPUSES. IMPROVEMENTS REALLY HAVE BEEN QUITE DRAMATIC. CSU MONTEREY BAY HAS INCREASED THEIR FOR YOUR GRADUATION RATES FOR FRESHMAN FROM TWENTY THREE PERCENT TO THIRTY PERCENT SINCE GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE HAS COMMENCED. AT SYNONYMOUS STATE THEY HAVE BEENCHRIS THEIR TWO YEAR GRADUATION RATE FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS FROM FIFTY ONE PERCENT TO SIXTY PERCENT IN JUST THE PAST TWO YEARS. WITHOUT QUESTION GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS HAVING THE DESIRED IMPACT ON STUDENT SUCCESS. SO WHAT THIS IS MEAN. FIRST AND FOREMOST IT MEANS THAT THESE GRADUATES ARE ABLE TO MOVE INTO THE WORKFORCE ARE CONTINUE THEIR ACADEMIC STUDIES PREPARED FOR SUCCESS. SECONDLY IT MEANS THAT MORE GRADUATES ARE BEING PRODUCED TO MEET THE STATE'S WORKFORCE NEEDS. AND THIRDLY IT MEANS MORE ACCESS FOR NEW STUDENTS LOOKING TO ENTER THE CSU. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE DEMAND FOR A CS YOU EDUCATION IT'S HIGHER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN BEFORE. THE RECENT HIGHER EDUCATION ELIGIBILITY STUDY FOUND THAT THE PERCENTAGE OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES MEETING THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SEE IT'S YOU. HAS INCREASED TO FORTY ONE PERCENT. A TESTAMENT TO IMPROVING K. TWELVE OUTCOMES AND STRONG PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN SCHOOLS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. AND AT THE SAME TIME MORE STUDENTS THAN EVER BEFORE ARE ENTERING THE CSU WITH AN ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER. AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THESE APPLICATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO RISE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE OFFER MORE AB T. PROGRAMS AND MORE STUDENTS WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PATHWAY. AS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM WORKS TO WHAT'S MEETING ITS OWN AMBITIOUS GOALS. THESE TRENDS ARE REALLY GREAT NEWS NOT ONLY FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES BUT ALSO FOR OUR STATE WHICH NEEDS THESE STUDENTS TO ATTEND COLLEGE GRADUATE AND JOIN THE WORKFORCE WITH A BACHELORS DEGREE. BUT THIS WORK MUST BE SUSTAINED AND SUPPORTED TO CONTINUE THIS MOMENTUM. MEETING CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE DEMANDS WILL REQUIRE BOTH IMPROVED GRADUATION RATES WHICH WE ARE WELL ON OUR WAY TO ACHIEVING THROUGH GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. BUT ALSO INCREASED UNIVERSITY ENROLLMENT. I WILL NOW TURN IT OVER TO VICE CHANCELLOR STEVE REALLY A WHO WILL SPEAK MORE ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES AND THE CHALLENGES FACING THE CSU OR LESS. ARE LESS SPEAK MORE OR LESS. GOT YOU. SO OUT OF THANK YOU LAUREN AND UP. THAT THIS AMBITIOUS PLAN HAT LAUREN HAS LAID OUT FOR YOU TO PROVE GRADUATION RATES AND ELIMINATE THE EQUITY GAPS AMONG. OUR STUDENTS DOES REQUIRE RESOURCES. SUSTAINABLE PREDICTABLE AND SUFFICIENT VESTMENT WILL CAN ALLOW US TO CONTINUE THE MOMENTUM AS WE FULFILL THIS MISSION. WERE THANKFUL FOR ALL THAT YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES IN BOTH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY. HAVE DONE AND YOUR RESPECTIVE STAFF HAS DONE TO HELP US INVEST IN THE AMBITIOUS GRADUATION INITIATIVE THAT LAUREN JUST DESCRIBED. SO I'M GONNA DIE JUST DIE QUICKLY TOUCH ON GIVEN OUR TIME CONSTRAINTS ARE THREE AREAS THAT HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO TO FILL THAT SEND BEFORE I TOUCH ON THOSE THREE. JUST BASICALLY STE ARE DESCRIBED AYE NUMERICALLY WHAT THE INVESTMENT LOOK LIKE TO GET TO THE RESULTS OF ORANGES TO DESCRIBE FOR YOU. THIS PAST YEAR THE CSU HAS INVESTED FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS TO HIRE SEVEN HUNDRED NEW TENURE TRACK FACULTY. AND WE HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED ADDITIONAL SEARCHES UNDERWAY RESULTING IN FOUR HUNDRED NET NEW FACT THE POSITIONS THAT ARE TEACHING AN ADDITIONAL THREE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED COURSES. EIGHTEEN MILLION ES BEEN INVESTED IN ADVISING ADDING TWO HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT NEW ADVISERS. TWENTY FOUR MILLION HAS BEEN INVESTED IN STUDENT AND ACADEMIC SUPPORT PROGRAMS WHICH LAUREN JUST DESCRIBED TO YOU AND THE INCLUDES THINGS LIKE TUTORING MENTORING SUMMER SESSION COURSES. OUR STUDENT WELLBEING PROGRAMS AND THE DAVID DIP DRIVEN DECISION ANALYSIS LARA DESCRIBED. SO WILL BE BRIEF PROVIDING A VERY DETAILED REPORT AT THE MARCH BOARD MEANING OR POOR TRUSTEES BUT LET ME TURN QUICKLY TO OF THE THE THREE AREAS. RESOURCE AREAS THAT REALLY IMPACT WHETHER WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL CONTINUE TO GET TO. THAT THAT THE NUMBERS THAT LAUREN HAS HAS DESCRIBED OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. THE FIRST IS JUST THE COST OF INCREASED ACCESS AND COMPLETION. YES YES YOU GRADUATION GRADUATION INITIATIVE TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND ALL OUR STUDENTS. SUCCESS EFFORTS HAVE RESULTED IN ADDED COST AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AS I JUST DESCRIBED SO SIMPLY PUT. MORE STUDENTS MEAN MORE COURSE SECTIONS IN COURSES THAT MEANS MORE FACT BEEN ADVISERS TO SUPPORT THOSE COURSES AND COURSE THAT TRANSLATES INTO MORE COSTS. WE ESTIMATE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS HE ISSUE WILL NEED AN ADDITIONAL SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. PER YEAR TO DIRECT TOWARDS THIS PLAN FOR A TOTAL IN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT OVER AT THE NEXT TO YEARS OF FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY TO FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. ONE REASON FOR THE NEED FOR THIS INVESTMENT CAN BE UNDERSTOOD STOOD BY OUR COLLECTIVE PRIORITY FOR ALL CSU UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WHO WANT TO FINISH IN FOUR YEARS. THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO DO SO GET THE COURSES THEY NEED AND GET TO FIFTEEN UNITS IN EACH SEMESTER. PICK A LIMITS QUICKLY THEN GO TO THE COST OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SAT AGAIN IT'S NOT JUST NOT TEACHERS IN CLASSROOMS AND MORE CLASSES BUT ALSO HAVING. UP FACILITIES THAT ARE NOT FALLING APART. AND WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING VERY HEAVILY ON OUR CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES OUR OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. BUT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE MAJOR PROBLEMS IN THIS AREA AT THE C. ISSUE CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE UTILITY FAILURES OF HOT WATER HEATING SYSTEMS FOR EXAMPLE AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS. AT CAMPUSES SUCH AS SAN FRANCISCO STATE AND FRESNO STATE. AND UNFORTUNATELY THESE ARE NOT THE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS THAT DONORS ARE GOING TO WANT TO FUND. THE FUNDING PROVIDED BY THE CSU IN STATE HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS THE MAINTENANCE ISSUES OF THIS AND SIMILAR UP PROJECTS. UP THE ERRORS AND ANNUAL NEED OF TOURING FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS CONTINUAL AGING OF THE SYSTEMS AND CHIP AWAY AT THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG. OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS. THEN THE THIRD. IN FINAL AREA THAT AFFECTS OUR ABILITY TO STAY THE COURSE ON TO GRADUATION INITIATIVE ARE OUR CLASSROOMS IN ACTION MAKE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. OUR STUDENTS DESERVE THE OPPORTUNITY A LEARNING CLASSROOMS LECTURE HALLS LABORATORIES AND LIBRARIES THAT ARE SAFE ENRICHING. AND REFLECT MARS TECHNOLOGY CENTRIC MERCK WORKPLACE. OUR FIVE YEAR FACILITIES PLAN WHICH WAS APPROVED LAST YEAR IDENTIFIED EIGHT POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS ENACTMENT PROGRAM INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. I NOW DUE TO THE CHANGES MADE SEVERAL YEARS AGO ON HOW THE STATE APPROACHES ARE INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING NEEDS. FUNDING FOR ENTRY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT I JUST DESCRIBED NOW COMPETES WITH ALL OTHER EXPENSES ALL OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES AND AND SUCH AS EXPANDING ACCESS AND HIRING ARE FACT MEAN STAFF. GIVEN THE HIGH PRIORITY OF THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE. INFRASTRUCTURE HAS GONE LARGELY UNFUNDED IN MANY CASES. FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN CSU CAMPUSES HAVE IDENTIFIED TWENTY EIGHT HIGH PRIORITY DEPARTMENT ARE AT A INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. WE'RE ANTICIPATING BEING ALL TO FIND TWO HUNDRED MILLION OR PORTION OF THAT NEED TO HELP FUND INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS LIFE THE LIBRARY PREPRESS REPLACEMENT PROJECT AT CAL STATE EAST BAY WHICH IS SUFFERING FROM SOME SEISMIC ISSUES. RENOVATE A LARGE CLASSROOM BUILDING AT CINEMA STATE AND CO FUND A SCIENCE IN AGRICULTURAL COMPLEX AT CAL POLY SAN LUIS OBISPO. THE TRUSTEES OPPORTUNE BUDGET NEED INCLUDES FIFTEEN MILLION TO FINANCE ABOUT TO HER TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN PROJECTS. WE PLAN TO ADDRESSED ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND RENOVATION. PROJECTS AT CHANNEL ISLANDS AND RENOVATIONS AT CAL MARITIME ACADEMY KALPANA SALAS OBISPO AND CAL STATE SAN PORTANTINO. SO I'M JUST GOING TO CONCLUDE MY REMARKS BY JUST SAYING THAT. THAT THE. IF THE TRENDS CONTINUE IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN THIS ISSUE BUDGET. OUR ABILITY TO ACCOMPLISH WHAT LAUREN HAS HIGHLIGHTED IS GONNA BE VERY VERY DIFFICULT IT WILL ESSENTIALLY STAGNATE. PROPOSED AUGMENTATION OF THE SEA ISSUE BUDGET OF NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YEAR. IS APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF THE MINIMAL. AMOUNT THAT THE TRUSTEES HAVE PUT FORTH. IN ITS TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE BUDGET. A REQUEST IN NOVEMBER. SO WITH THAT I'M GOING TO. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING AND. TURNED OVER GOT MIKE OVER TO LAUREN TO CONCLUDE. AND I TURNED IT OVER TO YOU FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE A QUESTIONS. YEAH AND THIS IS REALLY KIND OF FOR ALL SEGMENTS BUT BUT ALL BUT I'LL ASK YOU AND. YOU KNOW WE NEED MORE PEOPLE WITH DEGREES. AND WE WANTED TO GO THROUGH OUR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES BECAUSE WE VALUE IN TRUST THEM AND SOMETIMES THE FOR PROFIT UNIVERSITIES. I DON'T TO THE BEST JOB IN GAL STUDENTS BUT ONE THING THAT FOR PROFIT UNIVERSITIES DO WELL. IS THEY SERVE THE NEEDS OF THE STUDENTS. YOU KNOW THERE THERE OUGHT ON RANCID. GOOD LOCATIONS GOOD ADVERTISING. CLASSES START EVERY MONDAY. AND THE BARRIERS TO ENTRY ARE ARE ARE LOW. THEY HAD CLASSES THAT FRIDAY NIGHTS A WEEK WHEN THE STUDENTS NEED THEM AND. YOU KNOW THAT THE PUSH BACK ON THAT THE PUBLIC SYSTEMS IS THAT YOU KNOW WE TEACH CLASSES WHEN IT MAKES SENSE FOR THAT. FACULTY MEMBERS CELL ROOMINESS TRADERS. MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY FROM. NINE TO THREE. BUT YOU GO OUT OTHER HOURS RATHER DAYS AND WE HAVE THIS. IN THESE FACILITIES ARE UNDER UTILIZED YOU KNOW HERE AT SAC STATE WE HAVE THIS AFRICA WAS CALLED THIS. SENIOR PROGRAMS COLOR RICHMOND PROGRAM. AND THEY USE THE WHOLE CAMPUS ON A FRIDAY BECAUSE. YES YOU START USING IT CSU S.. SO. I KNOW THERE'S ALL THESE CAPITAL NEEDS IN THIS IS NOT JUST FOR YOU THIS IS FOR THE ALL THREE SEGMENTS SO. WHAT CAN WE DO DIFFERENTLY TO TO MINIMIZE THAT THE NEED TO PUT SO MUCH MONEY AND READ SOME ARTICLES IN THE BEAT? REHAB BUT YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT ROT UTILIZING OUR ASSETS TO THE TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY. TIMES AND DAYS OF THE WEEK SO. WE DON'T HAVE UNLIMITED MONEY IF YOU'RE SO WHAT CAN WE DO DIFFERENTLY TO TO ADDRESS THAT. MONEY ISSUE AND ALSO WHEN POTENTIALLY STUDENTS WANT TO GO TO CLASS. PUPPY OUT START A KNOW THAT. ONE STRATEGY THAT SEVERAL OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE BEGUN TO IMPLEMENT A LOOKING AT. SPACE UTILIZATION. AND CONDUCTING STUDIES TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHERE THE GAPS ARE. IN TERMS OF CLASSROOMS THAT ARE NOT BEING USED AND THEN USING THAT THEN TO WORK WITH THE VARIOUS ACADEMIC COLLEGE IS. A TO RETHINK THEIR TRADITIONAL NINE TO THREE ARE NINE TO FIVE STRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE TO OFFER COURSES. AND PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR FACULTY WHO WISH THEN OUGHT TO OFFER COURSES PERHAPS IN THE LATER EVENING ON WEEKENDS A AND THAT MORE IMPORTANTLY IN SURVEYING STUDENTS. DETERMINING BASED ON MANY OF THEM WORKING IN THEIR SCHEDULES WHAT COULD BE MORE TIME SLOTS THAT GO BEYOND THEIR TRADITIONAL TIME FRAME OF THE COURSES CAN BE OFFERED AND THAT FACULTY WILL DELIVER THOSE COURSES. WE SEE CHANGES HAPPENING. AT SAN MARCOS A AS A RESULT O THAT. AND WE CERTAINLY ANTICIPATE THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE OTHER CHANGES AS WELL BASED ON A GROWING NUMBER BY CAMPUS IS CONDUCTING THE SPACE UTILIZATION STUDIES. THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE OKAY. AND AND THEN UST YEAH I KNOW THAT. WHEN GIVEN A GREATER DETAIL DURING THE BUDGET HEARINGS I WANTED. IF TAKE UP TOO MUCH TIME TODAY BUT AS FAR AS THE. THE GRADUATION INITIATIVES I THINK FANTASTIC WORK YOU ALL ARE DOING. I SEE IT RIGHT HERE AT C. S. U. S.. SO IF YOU CAN LOOK AROUND AT THE MACRO LEVEL. WHAT WERE THE BIGGEST TAKEAWAY CC FOR FIRST COUPLE YEARS AS FAR AS THE MOST EFFECTIVE THINGS THAT? TWENTY FIVE CAMPUS WIDE HEARD WHATEVER NEVER IS IS DOING. AND THAT WE COULD DO MORE OUT. WELL GOOD QUESTION. I WOULD SAY THAT. WHAT WE'RE LEARNING NOW AND WHAT'S GOING TO BE THAT THE THE BIGGEST TAKE WAY FOR US ESPECIALLY AS WE ARE? WORKING TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. RESTRUCTURING OF THE DEVELOPMENT EDUCATION PROGRAM WHICH WE HAVE LAID THE FOUNDATION FOR THAT TO OCCUR. AND THAT WE HAVE SEEN RESULTS ALREADY IN ENGLISH OF WHERE OF A LOT OF THOSE COURSES THAT WERE NON CREDIT BEARING. THAT ENGLISH FACULTY HAVE CONVERTED THOSE OVER ALREADY INTO CREDIT BEARING COURSES. AND WE'RE SEEING STUDENTS OBVIOUSLY GRADUATING I IN A TIMELY MANNER OBVIOUSLY MATHEMATICS HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST BARRIER. NOT ONLY FOR US IT'S THE ISSUE BUT IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE NATION. IT HAD MATHEMATICS PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN A STRUGGLE FOR A NUMBER OF STUDENTS ESPECIALLY FOR STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND SO THE IMPLEMENTATION THEN OF THAT SAME CO REQUISITE MODEL FOR MATHEMATICS OF THAT WERE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPERFECT OF. OF FINALIZING NOW FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND FALL TWENTY EIGHTEEN I CAN SAY TO YOU THAT WE BELIEVE WILL MOVE THE NEEDLE VERY SIGNIFICANTLY. AS IT RELATES TO ALLOWING MORE STUDENTS AND IT AND PARTICULARLY MORE STUDENTS OF COLOR. TO BE ABLE TO GRADUATE AND I'M AN A TIMELIER MANNER AND MORE IMPORTANTLY OF BE PREPARED. AT IT WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF QUALITY THAT WE WOULD ANTICIPATE OTHER STUDENTS COMPLETING AND BEING READY FOR THE WORKFORCE SO THAT'S ONE OF THE ONE OF THE TAKEOVER TAKEAWAYS. THE OTHER IS OF REALLY LOOKING VERY CAREFULLY. AT HOW STUDENTS REALLY ARE PROGRESSING. IT'S IT'S TYING IN WITH THE DATA DRIVEN KIND OF WORK THAT WE HAVE TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT IF THERE ARE STILL SOME STUDENTS. OF THAT ARE NOT PROGRESSING IN A TIMELY MANNER WHAT OF THOSE BARRIERS AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY ARE AND ADDRESSING THEM IN A TIMELY MANNER SO THAT NO START STONES ARE LEFT UNTURNED. AS IT RELATES TO PERSISTENCE AND COMPLETION OF OUR STUDENTS. THANK YOU POCKET JUST THAT VERY QUICKLY AT TO TO WHAT BY LAUREN JUSTICE SAID THAT THOSE TOOLS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET STUDENTS TO TAKE CORRECT LASSES BUT IT'S CARQUEST KEYED TO HAVE. THOSE ADDITIONAL CLASSES SO THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET INTO THOSE CLASSES AND THAT'S BEEN AS MANY VIEW PROBABLY HEARD FROM CONCERNED PARENTS AND STUDENTS AS IT'S BEEN SUCH A. A BIG GUY OBSTACLE IS HAVING ENOUGH COURSES AND ENOUGH FACTLY TEACHES COURSES SO THOSE TOOLS THAT LAUREN WAS DISCUSSING A BEEN THAT BEEN. VERY EFFECTIVE BUT WE'VE HAD TO HAVE ENOUGH CLASSES AND A FACT WE TEACH IN THOSE CLASSES TO. DIRECTIVE STUDENTS. TO GET THE HIGHER UNIT LOAD. OKAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WELL NEXT BRING UP OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM LESS THAN TWO. I RESPOND TO THAT. QUESTION OF THE DAY HOW TO BE DELIVERED TO CREEK GAP PERFECT I THOUGHT CHRISTIAN US MILLION PLACE CHANCELLOR FURTHER FINANCE IN FACILITIES PLANNING AT THE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. JOINED BY EXECUTIVE VICE CHANCELLOR LAURA HOPE INDEED MATTHEW ROBERTS. THE SERGEANTS HAVE PASSED OUT MATERIALS THAT WE WILL SIMPLY REFERENCE WE WILL MOVE CONCISELY AND WE'LL START WITH EXECUTIVE VICE CHANCELLOR HELP. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION ON THIS MATTER IT'S OUR PRIVILEGE TO BE HERE AND. TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT THE MAJOR DIRECTIONS OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES EMBRACING. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE GAPS THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS MORNING. UP WITH IN YOUR PACKET ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'LL FIND IS A CHANCELLOR OR TEASE OAKLEY'S VISION FOR SUCCESS. AND SPECIFICALLY THE VISION FOR SUCCESS OUTLINED SIX MAJOR GOALS ON THE ONES THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS DEGREE ATTAINMENT ARE THESE. INCREASING THE A NUMBERS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO OBTAIN CREDENTIALS DEGREES AND SKILL SETS. TO PREPARE THEM FOR HIGH DEMAND JOBS BY TWENTY PERCENT. INCREASED THE NUMBERS OF STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT JUST TRANSFER PREPARED BUT WHO TRANSFER TO THE CS YOU WHEN YOU SEE. BY THIRTY FIVE PERCENT AND TO DECREASE THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF UNITS ACCUMULATED BY CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. WHO EARN ASSOCIATE DEGREES FROM APPROXIMATELY EIGHTY SEVEN UNITS? DOWN TO SEVENTY NINE WHICH IS THE TOP PERFORMING COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY. AND FINALLY TO ELIMINATE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS ACROSS THE BOARD WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS. AS EVER THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICABLE JUST STRIVE TO PROVIDE ALL OF OUR STUDENTS WITH AN IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE. AND EDUCATION WHICH MEANS REDUCING THE IMPACT OF RACIAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INEQUITIES. AS THESE GOALS INDICATE TRANSFER AND THE ASSOCIATES DEGREE ATTAINMENT OUR TOP PRIORITIES FOR THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND FOR CHANCELLOR. TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS COMMITTED TO SEVERAL MAJOR DIRECTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. ON OUR CURRENT STUDENTS AND ALSO CULTIVATE SUCCESS AMONG STUDENTS WHO HAVE NOT YET FOUND THEIR WAY TO OUR DOORS. THESE EMERGING DIRECTIONS INCLUDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF GUIDED PATHWAYS STATEWIDE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT GUIDED PATHWAYS ALREADY FROM SOME OF OUR PREVIOUS SPEAKERS. THE OTHER ADDITIONAL DIRECTIONS THAT WE THINK WE'LL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT INCLUDE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW FUNDING FORMULA. AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW ONLINE COLLEGE. SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON STRANDED WORKERS WHO ARE NOT CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN OUR SYSTEM. THESE ARE ENORMOUS GOALS THAT RICK WILL REQUIRE TIME AND SUSTAINED COMMITMENT ON GOING IMPROVEMENT. SO LET ME START WITH A LITTLE EXPLANATION ABOUT GUIDED PATHWAYS. VERY PATHWAYS IS A FRAMEWORK NOT A PROGRAM NOT AN INITIATIVE BUT A REENGINEERING OF THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. IS BASED ON A NATIONAL MODEL AND REFUTE REFER FUELED BY REFORM MOVEMENTS THAT ARE EVIDENCE BASED APPROACHES THAT KEEP STUDENTS OF THE ORGANIZATIONAL CENTER. OF OF THE COLLEGE PROCESS. THE GUIDED PATHWAYS FRAMEWORK FEATURES FOUR PILLARS. THE FIRST IN MANY WAYS FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AT LEAST IS ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING. AND THAT IS CLARIFYING THE PATH. THAT STUDENTS WILL TAKE. AS WAS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BUILT IN CALIFORNIA IS A WONDERFUL SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES TREMENDOUS ACCESS BUT IT IS ALSO EXTREMELY COMPLICATED. ON ONE OF THE THINGS I COULD TELL YOU ANECDOTALLY I COME FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND WE INLAND EMPIRE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NOTED IS THAT. A NUMBER OF OUR STUDENTS COME UNDECIDED AND THEY ALSO HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME FOLLOWING A PROGRAM MAP BECAUSE THERE MAY ONLY BE ONE OR TWO COURSES DIFFERENCE. IN FIVE OR SIX BUSINESS PROGRAMS. SO ONE OF THE OUR JOBS WITH CLARIFYING THE PATH IS MAKING SURE THAT WE CREATE CONDITIONS FOR THE FACULTY. TO CREATE MORE CLARIFIED PROGRAM MAPS FOR STUDENTS TO FOLLOW. SO THAT THEY CAN MORE CLEARLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT THEY NEED TO TAKE AND DO SO MORE EFFICIENTLY. SINCE MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ARE FIRST GENERATION. WE WANT TO PROVIDE OUR STUDENTS WITH RELENTLESS CLARITY THAT'S NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE SUCCESSFUL NAVIGATION OF OUR SYSTEM. THAT AS I MENTIONED HAS BECOME UNNECESSARILY COMPLEX. PILLAR TO PRIORITIZE THE NEED TO HELP STUDENTS MORE SEAMLESSLY ENTER THEIR EDUCATIONAL PATHWAY AND WE'RE WORKING TO DO SOME OF THOSE THINGS THROUGH CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT DUAL ENROLLMENT. AND A BETTER ON BOARDING PROCESS FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. WITH ONGOING INTERACTIONS RATHER THAN JUST SORT OF THAT INITIAL OF ORIENTATION. PILLAR THREE IS A COMMITMENT TO HELP STUDENTS STAY ON THEIR CHOSEN PATHWAY NUDGING THEM THROUGH TO THEIR MILESTONES AND COMPLETION POINTS. ENGAGING THEM WHEN THEY WAVER OR EXPERIENCE CHALLENGES. I FINALLY PILLAR FOR ENSURES THAT STUDENTS CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE SAME RIGOROUS AND VALUABLE LEARNING EXPERIENCES. THAT OUR FACULTY ARE VERY DEDICATED TO. CONTINUING FOR EVERYONE. ALL OF THESE COMPONENTS REQUIRE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW APPROACHES AND SYSTEMS THAT GO BEYOND SPECIAL PROGRAMS. SCALE EFFECTIVE PRACTICES TO ALL STUDENTS MAKING SURE THAT THEY REACH THE GOALS THAT THEY CHOOSE. GUIDED PATHWAYS IS ALSO BEING SUPPORTED THROUGH A NUMBER OF REFORM EFFORTS. SPECIFICALLY THE REFORMS AND DEVELOPMENTAL AGE EDUCATION REFORM THAT OF AN OUTLINE IN AB SEVEN OH FIVE. AB SEVEN A FIVE WILL REQUIRE COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ASSURE THAT STUDENTS COMPLETE TRANSFER LEVEL ENGLISH OR MATH. WITHIN A YEAR SOME COLLEGES ARE ALREADY ENGAGING THOSE REFORMS WITH TREMENDOUS RESULTS. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW IS THAT THERE'S MORE THAT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO DO THAT SO CORRECT WAS THAT MODEL IS ONE OPTION. STAT WAY MODEL IS ANOTHER A BUT WE THINK THAT THIS WILL BE THE KEY TO HELPING MORE OF OUR STUDENTS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE. AND ALSO ADDRESSING MANY OF THE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS THAT HAVE BEEN SO STUBBORN FOR MANY DECADES. THE ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE FOR TRANSFER ALSO INITIATED NAM IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN MANY WAYS REFLECTS THE BEGINNINGS OF GUIDED PATHWAYS EFFORTS IN OUR IN OUR SYSTEM. AS YOU MAY RECALL THE ADT IS A FULLY ARTICULATED AND SYSTEM WIDE CURRICULUM MAP FOR OVER THIRTY DEGREE PATTERNS. THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AS WELL AS OUR CSU PARTNERS ARE COMMITTED TO THE SISTINE SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT OVER THE AGE OF THE AB T.. OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS THE AB T. HAS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY AS EVIDENCED BY THE FOLLOWING DATA. IN TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN TO TWO THOUSAND TWELVE APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED ASSOCIATE DEGREES FOR TRANSFER WERE AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA COMMUNICABLE URGE STUDENTS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICABLE EDGES NOW OFFER. TWENTY THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE EIGHTY TEASE TO STUDENTS WITH THAT ARE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES. ELK TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND TWELVE APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED ASSOCIATE DEGREES FOR TRANSFER WERE AWARDED TO CALIFORNIA COMMUNICATIVE STUDENTS. AND IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE ASSOCIATE DEGREES FOR TRANSFER WERE AWARDED. WHICH PUTS US ON TRACK TO EARN THE NUMBER OF OF. DEGREES AS A GOAL OF FORTY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THE ASSOCIATE DEGREES FOR TRANSFER HAVE ALSO DEMONSTRATED PROGRESS TOWARD AMELIORATING ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AMONG VARIOUS STUDENT GROUPS. FOR INSTANCE LATINO LATINO STUDENTS GROWTH IN AT T. OBTAINMENT HAS BEEN EXPONENTIAL FROM LESS THAN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWELVE AND TWENTY THIRTEEN. TO ALMOST EIGHTEEN THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN. HOWEVER AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS DEGREE OBTAINMENT WALL PROVING HAS NOT GROWN AT THE SAME RATES AN ISSUE THAT GUIDED PATHWAYS AND BASIC SKILLS REFORM. WILL HELP TO CHANGE. MORE SYSTEMATIC WORK HOWEVER NEEDS TO BE DONE TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION NEEDS. AND TO THAT END A NEW FUNDING FORMULA HAS BEEN PROPOSED ONE THAT WOULD HELP STABILIZE FUNDING RATES LOCALLY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT CALIFORNIA'S NEEDIEST STUDENTS. AND INCENTIVIZE WORK THAT RESULTS IN INCREASED STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT. THE CURRENT FUNDING MODEL IS SOLELY BASED ON STUDENT ENROLLMENT AND GROWTH AND IT SHARPLY PENALIZES COLLEGES WHEN THE ECONOMY SHIFTS AND GROWTH IS MORE DIFFICULT. WITHOUT GROWTH DOLLARS OR COLA COLLEGES DO NOT HAVE A SYSTEMATIC WAY TO CULTIVATE FUNDING INCREASES TO MEET THE CHANGING NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENT BODY. WITH A MORE BALANCED APPROACH TO FUNDING THAT INCORPORATES. THREE DIFFERENT LEGS WE THINK THAT UP COLLEGES WILL HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO INNOVATE AND SUPPORT THEIR STUDENTS. THE DETAILS OF HOW THE FUNDING FORMULA WILL SPECIFICALLY WORK ARE BEING DISCUSSED NOW AND CHANCER OAKLEY HAS ASKED THE PRESIDENTS AND CHANCELLORS TO TAKE THE LEAD ON DEVELOPING THE SPECIFICS OF THE MODEL. FINALLY THE BUDGET INCLUDES A PROPOSAL FOR A NEW ONLINE COLLEGE. BOTH THE GOVERNOR AND CHANCER OAKLEY ARE FORWARD THINKING AND LOOKING AT WAYS THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM CAN ADDRESS NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS. WHO ARE NOT ALREADY BEING SERVED? CURRENT LABOR RESEARCH PAINTS A DIM PICTURE OF THE ECONOMIC STABILITY OF CALIFORNIANS WITH LITTLE OR NO COLLEGE EDUCATION. AND YET THAT IS THE SITUATION FOR TOO MANY. AS THE DEMANDS FOR JOB SKILLS CONTINUE TO GROW AND CHANGE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE NEEDS TO DYNAMICALLY MEET THOSE NEEDS. AND ALSO PROVIDE ACCESS TO WORKERS WHO ARE IN MANY WAYS STRANDED. STRANDED BECAUSE THEIR WORK SCHEDULES ARE CONDITIONS LIMIT THEIR CAPACITY TO ATTEND A TRADITIONAL BRICK AND MORTAR COLLEGE. STRANDED BY TRADITIONAL ENOUGH FLEXIBLE OPPORTUNITY. AND STRANDED BY A DEFINITION OF EDUCATION THE DOES NOT FLEX OPTIONS FOR SUB AWARDS OR MICRO CREDENTIALS. THAT WOULD BOOST EARNING CAPACITY AND ALSO FINANCIAL STABILITY. THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNICABLE JUST HAVE ALREADY ENGAGED ONLINE LEARNING FOR MANY OF ITS TRADITIONAL PROGRAMMING OFFERINGS. THROUGH THE ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE. AND THROUGH THAT INITIATIVE MUCH HAS BEEN LEARNED ABOUT THE BEST WAY TO DESIGN COURSES TO PROVIDE STUDENTS SUPPORT. TO PROVIDE TECHNOLOGY INTERFACES HOWEVER THE ONLY I THE ONLINE EDUCATION INITIATIVE WAS DESIGNED TO SERVE. CURRENT STUDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY ENGAGED IN THE ASSOCIATE DEGREE FOR TRANSFER WORK. AND WHO ARE NOW LEARNING ON A TRADITIONAL SEMESTER OR QUARTER CALENDAR. THE NEW ONLINE COLLEGE IS CURRENTLY DEVISED TO BE SOMETHING MUCH DIFFERENT. A PLATFORM IN WHICH STUDENTS COULD ENROLL IMMEDIATELY AND ENGAGE IN BURSTS OF EDUCATION RESULTING IN MEANINGFUL PROFESSIONAL SKILLS THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY APPLICABLE. THAT COULD MEAN ANYTHING FROM A FOOD HANDLER'S LICENSE THAT MIGHT TAKE TWO HOURS. OR PROJECT MANAGEMENT BADGE THAT MIGHT TAKE TWO OR THREE WEEKS. THE NEW ONLINE COLLEGE IS ALSO BEING DESIGNED OF THE COMPETENCY BASED MODEL. MEANING THAT IT IS DESIGNED AROUND THE LEARNERS OWN PACE TOWARD DEVELOPING MASTERY OF THE MATERIAL. AND USING CONSTANT FEEDBACK AND EDUCATED TECHNOLOGY. IT IS NOT BUILT ON A TRADITIONAL MODEL OF READ AND RESPOND BUT INSTEAD ON THE CONCEPT THAT LEARNING IS DYNAMIC AND INDIVIDUALIZED. AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE THIS PROPOSAL IS A LONG TERM PROJECT AND THE GOVERNOR HAS IDENTIFIED SIGNIFICANT DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE FOUNDATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THAT PROJECT. THE CHANCES OFFICES COMMITTED TO ESTABLISHING PROGRAMS THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE AND CONSCIOUS OF LABOR DEMANDS AND IS BEGINNING TO ESTABLISH. SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE AROUND ACCREDITATION AND GOVERNANCE. ALL OF THESE BIG GOAL SUGGEST. THAT WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE SPEC EXPANDING ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL STUDENTS INCREASING OUTCOMES. ESPECIALLY AMONG OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS AND IMPROVING THE LIFE OF ALL OF OUR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS AND STUDENTS. SO TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ASPECT OF OUR INITIATIVES I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO DEAN MATH ROCK. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE I THINK WE'RE IN THE AFTERNOON NOW ON MATTHEW ROBERTS LIKE WITH THE. DIVISION OF WORKFORCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT UNDER BONTA UNCLE ALONE SHE SENDS HER REGARDS TODAY. COULDN'T BE HEAR UP I'M ALSO THE FORMER SUPERINTENDENT FOR THE GULF HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY SO COMING FROM THE CATO SYSTEM. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MIDDLE SKILL JOBS THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF WORKFORCE ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF TRYING TO CREATE STACKABLE CREDENTIALS ARE STACKABLE DEGREES WHERE STUDENTS CAN SORT OF. VERSUS IN A VERSATILE WAY SORT OF DRAW UPON. MULTI DISCIPLINES FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE HOUSE WHETHER BE WHAT WE TRADITIONALLY CALL ACADEMICS OR WILL WE ALSO CALL ACADEMICS INTRUDER EDUCATION. AND SO UP FOCUSING ON THESE MIDDLE SKILL A JOBS IN THESE OPENINGS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING PROBABLY FOR THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. UNDER STRONG WORK FORCE UNDER. AB G. ADULT EDUCATION BLOCK GRANT FUNDS REALLY TRYING TO OUTCOMES IN THE SYSTEM. AND AS LAURA MENTIONED THIS MORNING AYE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING COMPLETIONS IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES BY TWENTY PERCENT. ARE LOOKING AT THE DATA AND YOU DO YOU HAVE A. A HANDOUT HERE IN YOUR PACKET TODAY THAT JUST KINDA TALKS ABOUT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE PROJECTIONS FOR THOSE MIDDLE SKILL JOBS. UP WHAT WE LOOK AT IN IN WORKFORCE IS OUR THE COMPLETIONS WHETHER IT WOULD BE A TRANSFER WHETHER IT WOULD BE DEGREE ATTAINMENT WHETHER IT WOULD BE CERTIFICATE ATTAINMENT. ALL OF THOSE COUNTY SORT OF OUTCOMES AND STACKABLE IN TERMS OF GETTING A STUDENT TO THEIR ULTIMATE DESTINATION OF. A GRADUATION BOTH IN COLLEGE AND CAREER. IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND SO WE WE RELY HEAVILY ON THE LABOR MARKET INFORMATION AS ASSEMBLY PERSON A BAKER TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TODAY. BUT WE ALSO TALK ABOUT ENGAGEMENT AND REALLY ENGAGING WITH THE REGIONAL ECONOMIES THAT ARE OUT IN THE SYSTEM UNDER STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM. THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPLEMENT A REGIONAL STRUCTURE. TO HELP SUPPORT THOSE REGIONAL ECONOMIES BECAUSE AS WE KNOW EACH REGION IS IS VERY DIFFERENT. AYE IN YOUR HANDOUT IT TALKS ABOUT THE TOP TWENTY FIVE. JOBS THAT. SORT OF SCOPE OUT ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT ARE MORE APPLICABLES FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM. AND YOU COULD SEE HEALTHCARE IS THE LEADING ONE. IN ADDITION TO OTHER A BIG INDUSTRIES SO WE ARE VERY HONED IN AND TARGETING OF THE REGIONAL ECONOMIES WE FEEL AS IF. THIS THIS ONE POINT THREE IS THIS THE STATE'S ONE POINT THREE MILLION. AT NEED GAP FOR MIDDLE SKILLED WORKERS IS IS A DEFINITE NEED AND SO WE DEFINITELY SEE THE THE OUTCOMES. GEARING UP AND WERE AND RAMPING UP WITHIN OUR OUR HUNDRED FOURTEEN COLLEGES AND SOON TO BE OUR HUNDRED FIFTEENTH WITH THE ONLINE COLLEGE. AND SO THAT'S PRODUCING GOOD RESULTS FOR US I SO HOPEFULLY YOU FIND THE. THE HANDOUT HELPFUL IN TERMS OF JUST GIVING YOU SOME BASELINE DATA BUT WE DO FEEL AS IF WE'RE. WE'RE GETTING VERY CLOSE TO ACHIEVING THAT GOAL OF OF A THROUGHPUT OF STUDENTS COMING UP FROM OUR K. TWELVE SYSTEM. AND OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND THEN ON TO. BUT I SEE ISSUE AND YOU SEE SO. WE'RE VERY PROUD OF OUR WORK OUT WITH THAT. AND I'LL MAKE SOME VERY QUICK POINTS ON INFRASTRUCTURE WE'VE INCLUDED IN THE PACKET  <u><c.green>A</c></u> PLAN THAT WE SUBMIT TO YOU IN THE ADMINISTRATION EVERY YEAR. UP TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THAT CHALLENGE THE FIVE YEAR PLAN ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS PROJECTS IN NEED OF TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLARS. OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IN CAPITAL PROJECTS. OF THAT TOTAL ABOUT NINE BILLION DOLLARS IS FOR NEW FACILITIES ABOUT TWELVE BILLIONS FOR MODERNIZATION OF EXISTING FACILITIES. OVER TEN YEARS WE EXPECT ABOUT A NEED GROWS TO ABOUT FOR A FORTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. EVEN THAT TOTAL THOUGH DOES NOT REPRESENT THE TOTAL FACILITIES NEED FOR THE COLLEGES AND AS WE'VE REPORTED BEFORE OUR OFFICE ESTIMATES THAT THERE'S MORE THAN ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN FACILITIES MAINTENANCE NEEDS OVER FIVE YEARS. AS YOU KNOW MEETING THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS OF THE COLLEGES AS A RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S BEEN SHARED BY THE STATE AND LET ME GO TO COLLEGE DISTRICTS. AND WE CAN ACCOUNT FOR THAT IN OUR PLANNING PROCESSES BY ESTIMATING THAT ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF THE NEED. IS ADDRESS WITH LOCAL FUNDS. I AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR THE LOCAL FUNDS AND PROPERTY ONE BOND FUNDS WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR PLAN THE FEW REMAINING NEED OF STATE FUNDS IS ABOUT SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER TEN YEARS. AS THE CHAIR NOTED. WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO MEET INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS ALL HIGHLIGHT TO THE FIRST IS ON YEAR ROUND INSTRUCTION. IN THAT REPORT YOU'LL SEE A STATISTIC THAT SAYS OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS OF INSTRUCTION. HAS INCREASED BY TWENTY THREE DAYS FROM TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE DAYS TO TUTOR AT NINETY FOUR DAYS. AND THAT WE KNOW ONLINE EDUCATION WILL HAVE IMPACTS ON OUR CAPITAL PLANNING AND SO WE MAKE ASSUMPTIONS. THAT WE UPSET ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THE NEED TO TRY TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT IMPACT. BUT IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY IN THIS AREA SECURING FUNDING FOR THE PROJECTS INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEMS BUDGET REQUEST. AND SO FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN WE HAD REQUESTED. THAT. THIRTY THREE PROJECTS BE FUNDED FIFTEEN CONTINUING PROJECTS EIGHTEEN NEW STAR PROJECTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FUNDS FIVE OF THOSE PROJECTS AND SO WERE WORKING WE PLAN TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO BETTER JUSTIFIER NEEDS BUT WE HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH YOU TO. TO EXPLAIN OUR NEEDS AS PART OF THIS PROCESS. AND OVER THE LONGER TERM WE HOPE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO BEST MEET PIC COLLEGES INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. BY NECESSITY WE CREATE THESE CAPITAL PLANS BY PROJECTING OUR CURRENT TRENDS. BUT THE POINT OF THE VISION OF SPUR SUCCESS IN OF THIS HEARING IS THAT MORE DRAMATIC CHANGE IS NEEDED. AND SO AS WE MADE OUR MOVE FORWARD WE HOPE WE CAN WORK WITH YOU TO CONSIDER SOME QUESTIONS HOW BEST ABOUT STATE LOCAL ROLES. HOW DO YOU TARGET RESOURCES TO THE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE UNIQUE NEEDS AND HOW DO YOU STRUCTURE INCENTIVES IN THE WAIT FOR DISTRICTS TO THINK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE CALLS? SO JUST CAN TO CONCLUDE ARE A FEW CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OBVIOUSLY THE SIZE OF OUR SYSTEM WOULD TWO POINT THREE MILLION STUDENTS. CREATES BOTH A CHALLENGE AND AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE SENSE THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY IMPACT. SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS. BUT ALSO IT'S A COMPLEX SYSTEM GIVEN ITS SIZE. SOME OTHER MORE A MORE GRANULAR CHALLENGES INCLUDE. IDENTIFYING ACTING UPON SEGMENTAL BARRIERS WITH BOTH K. TWELVE AND UNIVERSITY PARTNERS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS MOVE MORE SEAMLESSLY THROUGH OUR SYSTEM AND ONE OF THINGS THAT WOULD HELP THAT IS. AS WAS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY OF BETTER ATTENTION TO DATA COLLECTION AND DATA SHARING. IT IS ALSO OUR HOPE. THAT STUDENTS OF WHO ARE ACHIEVING A AT THE AB T. WOULD HAVE OPTIONS BETWEEN BOTH THE CSU AND YOU SEE AND NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE ONE OR THE OTHER TWO EARLY IN THEIR. COLLEGE CAREER SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE INDEPENDENT UNIVERSITIES AS WELL AS THE YOU SEE HONOR THE ADT. WE ALSO KNOW THAT OUR SYSTEM COULD IMPROVE WITH. IN TERMS OF ACTION PLANNING WITH MORE POST EMPLOYMENT DATA. ON IF WE HAVE THAT AVAILABLE THAT WOULD ASSIST US. AND. WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY. QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. WE WARN YOU OUT YEAH I KNOW BUT. YOU HAVE. A AMERICA IT'S IT'S ARE. REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT CAUCUS LUNCH RIGHT NOW WE ARE MISSING SO. AND IN SOME OF THE ISSUES FRANKLY WILL BE DISCUSSING IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND LATER ON THE SPRING SO. VOTE CONTINUE BRING UP OUR INDEPENDENT COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES AND. MAKE SURE WE DON'T IGNORE THEM. YEAH. GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M BETH HELMET ON THE PRESIDENT OF MEL'S COLLEGE I'M GRATEFUL NOT TO BE IGNORED AND I'M AWARE WERE BETWEEN YOU AND PUBLIC COMMENT AND LUNCH SO. WE WILL ACCELERATE OUR PRESENTATION HERE. THANK YOU A CHAIR MCCARTY AND STEPPED OUT FOR YOUR PRESENCE HERE ALSO ALL THE. MEMBERS WHO ARE STILL HERE. LISTENING TO US. AS THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE INDEPENDENT COLLEGES OF CALIFORNIA I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE. COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THAT COLLECTIVELY GRANT MORE THAN ONE FIFTH OF ALL THE UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES IN THE STATE EACH YEAR. AND MORE THAN HALF OF ALL OF OUR GRADUATE DEGREES. WE ALSO INVEST INSTITUTIONALLY IN OUR STUDENTS. BILLS ITSELF A HISTORICALLY A WOMEN'S COLLEGE THAT GRANTS DEGREES TO WOMEN AND GENDER NON BINARY STUDENTS AT THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL AND ALL GENDERS AT THE GRADUATE LEVEL. WE ENROLL ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED STUDENTS. AND WE GIVE INSTITUTIONAL AID OF ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR. OVERALL OUR SECTOR GIVES EIGHT ON THE ORDER OF ONE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR TO USE TO STUDENTS. WE ALSO ENROLL A MAJORITY OF OUR STUDENTS FROM CALIFORNIA AT MILLS THAT MEANS ABOUT FOUR FIFTHS OF OUR STUDENTS COME FROM CALIFORNIA AND FOUR OF THE INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE A I CC YOU. IT MEANS ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF OUR STUDENTS COME FROM CALIFORNIA. ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS AT MILLS OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR THAT'S ABOUT THAT'S ABOUT COMPARABLE TO THE AVERAGE ACROSS THE A I CC YOU INSTITUTIONS. WE HAVE THIRTY PERCENT LATINO STUDENTS AT MILLS I'M ABOUT A QUARTER AT OVERALL AT ACROSS THE SECTOR. WE ARE HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTION AT MILLS AS OUR THIRTY ONE OTHER. CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. WE ENROLL MORE THAN A THIRD FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS OVERALL WE ENROLL ABOUT. HALF FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS AT MILLS HALF OF OUR STUDENTS ARE PAL ELIGIBLE ACROSS THE SECTOR IT'S ALMOST THIRTY PERCENT. CAN ALSO OF HALF CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS FOR WHICH WE'RE GRATEFUL OFF FOR YOUR SUPPORT. ACROSS THE SECTOR IT'S ABOUT FOURTEEN PERCENT ALSO MENTION THAT MILLS IS MORE THAN HALF LGBTQ. WHICH IS A SIGN OF WHERE WE ARE IN THE BAY AREA TO AND NOW I WANNA FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON OUT HOW MILLS HAS WORKED ACROSS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO CONNECT TO THE PUBLIC SECTOR. INTO THE ARCADE THROUGH TWELVE SECTOR TO ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO MEET CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE NEEDS. SO THERE'S THREE THINGS I THAT I'LL TALK TO YOU ON BEHALF OF THE A I CC YOU AND NO TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE A I CC YOU CHRISTENSEN ARE AS IS IN WASHINGTON DC OTHERWISE SHE WOULD BE HERE FOR YOU SO I'M PINCH HITTING. OB. WITH THE SEVENTY EIGHT CAMPUSES THAT A AYE CCU HASN'T SEVENTY SERVE UNDERGRADUATES. MORE THAN FIFTY SIX ALREADY HAVE ARTICULATION AGREEMENTS WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO IN TERMS OF ADVANCING ACCESS. I THE INDEPENDENT SECTOR IS VERY MUCH INVESTED IN ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. MOST STUDENTS AND FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE CLOSE TO AN INDEPENDENT COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY. AND MANY OF OUR COLLEGES. HAVE ALREADY I WORK TO INTEGRATE THE EIGHTY T. PROGRAM MILLS AND MANY OTHER INSTITUTIONS ARE WORKING TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW AT MILLS WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHTEEN MAJORS THAT WE SEE MAPPING INTO THAT ASSOCIATE DEGREE TRANSFER PROGRAM. SO ACCESS IS A CRITICAL PIECE FROM MY DEMOGRAPHIC SKETCH YOU ALREADY SEE THAT THE SECOND THING I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IS COMPLETION. A I CC YOU INSTITUTIONS ALREADY HOLD THE HIGHEST COMPLETION RATES IN THE STATE. OUR FACULTY TO STUDENT RATIOS ARE LOW BUT ELEVEN TO ONE. WE ACTUALLY HAVE A STRONG DEGREE OF CONNECTION AND SENSE OF BELONGING FOR OUR STUDENTS BASED IN PART ON OUR SIZE AND OUR ON OUR ATTITUDE OF PUTTING STUDENTS AT THE CENTER OF OUR MISSION. HOWEVER WE'RE NOT DOING WELL ENOUGH THERE AND WE'RE NOT STANDING FAST. AT MILLS FOR INSTANCE THERE SEVERAL INITIATIVES THAT ARE UNDERWAY TO IMPROVE HOW STUDENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES ACTUALLY DO WITH AN ART DEGREE GRANTING PROGRAMS. A FEW EXAMPLES AM POWER IS A NEW SIGNATURE UNDERGRADUATE EXPERIENCE FOR US THAT FOCUSES ON COMMUNITY ENGAGED LEARNING AND FACULTY MENTORS UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERY STUDENT. WE ALSO ARE IMPLEMENTING E. PORTFOLIOS WHICH GIVE STUDENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A METACOGNITIVE LEARNING REFLECTION TOLL THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES BECAUSE STUDENTS HAVE A CHANCE TO CONNECT TO THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING. AND PREPARE IT AND CURATED FOR FUTURE EMPLOYERS AND GRADUATE SCHOOLS THAT THEY MIGHT BE INTERESTED AND. WERE ALSO INTERESTED IN MANY OF THE INITIATIVES YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD ABOUT FROM OTHERS ACROSS THE PUBLIC SECTOR. TRANSFORMATIONAL ADVISING. ACADEMIC NAVIGATORS WHO CAN HELP STUDENTS UNDERSTAND AND SUCCEED WITH AN ACADEMIC AND CAREER ENVIRONMENTS. AND ALSO DEVELOPING OUR FACULTY WERE ASKING A LOT OF OUR FACULTY TODAY AT THE INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND ELSEWHERE AND WE NEED TO HELP THEM PREPARE TO MEET THAT CHALLENGE BY A BY PREPARING THEM UP FOR THE THE MULTIPLE ROLES THEY HAVE NOW. FINALLY WITH COMPLETION WE CAN'T FAIL TO TALK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY WE REALIZE THOSE THINGS GO HAND IN HAND ACROSS THE SECTOR WERE WORKING TO PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AID TO OUR STUDENTS. AT MILLS WE'VE IMPLEMENTED A HISTORIC TUITION RESET WHERE WE REDUCED OUR TUITION BY THIRTY SIX PERCENT FOR NEXT YEAR. THAT ENABLES US TO BETTER TRANSLATE OUR VALUE TO STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WHO ACTUALLY CAN'T AFFORD AN EDUCATION AND INDEPENDENT COLLEGE BUT DON'T ALWAYS REALIZE THAT FROM THE COMPLEXITY OF PRICING THAT HAS BECOME A HALLMARK OF HIGHER ED. THE LAST THING I WANT TO TALK TO ABOUT HIS INNOVATION AND IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT COMING FROM THE BAY AREA I WOULD TALK TO YOU ABOUT INNOVATION. I I WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES FROM ACROSS OUR SECTOR I THINK IT'S BEEN A HALLMARK OF CALIFORNIA'S INDEPENDENT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO EXPERIMENT TO TRY THINGS AND TO. HIT ON NEW IDEAS THAT CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE UP ACROSS HIGHER EDUCATION AND NOT ONLY EVEN IN CALIFORNIA. SO CALIFORNIA'S INDEPENDENT COLLEGES WERE AMONG THE FIRST TO HAVE FOUR YEAR COMBINED BACHELORS AND TEACHING CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS. WERE INNOVATORS IN THE ONLINE SPEAR FROM WHICH YOU'LL HEAR MORE FROM MY COLLEAGUE A DOCTOR DAVID PULL FROM CALIFORNIA BAPTIST UNIVERSITY. WE'VE ALSO HAD SEVERAL INSTITUTIONS MAKE SPECIFIC ARRANGEMENTS A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES POINT LOMA NAZARENE UNIVERSITY LANDLOCKED AND NOT ABLE TO PHYSICALLY GROW CREATED A PARTNERSHIP WITH ITS LOCAL SAN DIEGO COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TO CREATE A TWO PLUS TWO PROGRAM SO THAT STUDENTS CAN COMPLETE A BACHELOR'S OF SCIENCE IN NURSING WITHOUT EVER LEAVING THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF THE PACIFIC. STOCKTON WITH SAN JOAQUIN DELTA COLLEGE WHERE THEY IDENTIFIED STUDENTS INTERESTED IN TEACHING AND RECRUITED THEM INTO A TWO PLUS TO PROGRAM WHERE THEY TRANSFER FINISHED AGREES AND EARNED A TEACHING CREDENTIAL IN JUST FOUR YEARS. THOSE ARE GREAT EXAMPLES OF COLLABORATIONS ACROSS THE SECTORS AT MILLS I WANNA SHARE SOME OF OUR OWN EFFORTS TO CREATE A HUB OF INNOVATION AND HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. SO WE'VE WORKED TO LEVERAGE OUR LOCATION IN THE BAY AREA AND IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO INCREASE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO PROMOTE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. AND COST SHARING BECAUSE WERE ALL TRYING TO REDUCE COSTS AND HIGHER ED. AND ALSO TO SEEK FOUGHT PARTNERS IN COLLABORATIVE WAYS TO ENHANCE INNOVATION. WE THINK WE CAN WORK WITH UC BERKELEY TO IMPROVE OUR OUR. COLLECTIVE CAPACITY TO ADVANCE BOB REGIONAL NEED TO MEET THOSE REGIONAL NEEDS AN EDUCATION. BECAUSE WE HAVE A CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND REPUTATION THAT CAN WORK AND COLLABORATION WITH UC BERKELEY'S TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES. WE'VE HAD A TASK FORCE RUNNING FOR MORE THAN A YEAR WE FORMALIZED THAT COLLABORATION WITH UC BERKELEY'S CHANCELLOR AND THAT TASK FORCE HAS ALREADY IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL INITIATIVES. THEY'RE ONLY REALLY LIMITED BY THEIR CREATIVITY AND INTEREST WE'VE ALREADY WORKED ON HOUSING COLLABORATION. ADDITIONAL CROSS REGISTRATION. KEY COURSES THAT ARE BERKELEY STUDENTS CAN TAKE AT MEL'S AND COURSES THAT MIL STUDENTS CAN TAKE AT BERKELEY. GLOBAL INTERNSHIP AND STUDY AWAY OPPORTUNITIES THREE PLUS TWO DEGREES A FAST TRACK TO GRADUATE DEGREES FOR UC BERKELEY STUDENTS FROM A FROM A FROM MILLS AND OTHER MEASURES. SO THAT'S A WAY FOR US TO HELP UC BERKELEY MEET ITS ITS CAPACITY ISSUES BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SOME OF THINGS MILLS IS ESPECIALLY GOOD AT. WE'VE ALSO WORKED WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT THE PERALTA DISTRICT IS A POWERHOUSE OF A COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT RIGHT IN OUR BACKYARD WE DEVELOP PATHWAYS TO DEGREES AND WE HAVE A TASK FORCE OPEN AND RUNNING I'M WORKING ON AN AMMO YOU. SO THAT WE CAN FORMALIZE THOSE AND FINALLY I WANT TO MENTION OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT. OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AYE HAS AN OAKLAND PROMISEPROGRAM THAT IS DEDICATED TO IMPROVING THOSE COMPLETION RATES FOR THE OAKLAND STUDENTS WHO ARE RIGHT OUTSIDE THE GATES OF MEL'S. THIS YEAR WE'VE GUARANTEED AN ADDITIONAL TEN SCHOLARSHIPS TO OAKLAND PROMISE STUDENTS THAT COMBINED WITH PELL GRANTS AND CAL GRANTS WILL ACTUALLY MAKE THE COST OF MILLS FREE TO STUDENTS I'M FROM OAKLAND. WITH THOSE SCHOLARSHIPS THROUGH THE OAKLAND PROMISE PROGRAM ONE OF THOSE IS FOCUSED ON AFRICAN AMERICAN FEMALE STUDENTS THE OTHER ON ONE OTHER SPECIFIED FOR A LATINA EXCELLENT STUDENT SO. SO WE'RE ACTUALLY FOCUSING ON THE DEMOGRAPHICS THAT ARE CHANGING FAST IS IN CALIFORNIA AND READY TO SERVE THEM. I'LL JUST SAY MORE GENERALLY FOR OUR SECTOR I THINK YOU'LL FIND US NIMBLE AND READY TO COLLABORATE ON TO MEET THIS WORKFORCE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE SAID AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM CALIFORNIA BAPTIST. THEY DON'T HELP WITH. A GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN NINA AND MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT TIMELY ISSUE. AND TODAY WE'VE HEARD ABOUT THE CHALLENGES FACING THE STATE'S FOLLOWING TO TALK ABOUT SOME SOLUTIONS. MY NAME IS DAVID COLE I'M VICE PRESIDENT OF THE DIVISION OF ONLINE AND PROFESSIONAL STUDIES AT CALIFORNIA BAPTIST UNIVERSITY. CEBU ONLINE WAS ESTABLISHED RESPONDED THE VERY DIFFERENT NEEDS OF THE NEW NORMAL GENERATION OF STUDENTS. THE NONTRADITIONAL STUDENT THAT BALANCES PROFESSIONAL AND FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES WHILE ADVANCING THEIR EDUCATION. OUR ONLINE AND HYBRID PROGRAMS OFFER STUDENTS THE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN FLEXIBILITY EXPECTED FOR TWENTY FIRST CENTURY LEARNING. CEBU ONLINE OFFERS DEGREE PROGRAMS UTILIZING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGIES AND DISTANCE EDUCATION THROUGH FACULTY AND STAFF WHO ARE COMMITTED TO THE STUDENTS ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS. CAL BAPTIST UNIVERSITY AS A WHOLE IS A WASP ACCREDITED NON PROFIT UNIVERSITY HEADQUARTERED IN THE CITY OF RIVERSIDE. WITH A PRESENCE THROUGHOUT RIVERSIDE AND SAN BENITO COUNTY AND BEYOND. THE UNIVERSITY WAS FOUNDED IN NINETEEN FIFTY CURRENTLY IN ROLES TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS AT THE UNDERGRADUATE GRADUATE AND DOCTORAL LEVEL.% OF OUR UNDERGRADS CLOSE TO THIRTY TWO HUNDRED ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN CEBU ONLINE. EACH YEAR CBO ONLINE GRADUATES APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN HUNDRED WITH BACHELOR'S DEGREES. HELPING THEM ACHIEVE THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION AND CAREER GOALS. REMEMBER THESE ARE PRIMARILY NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS. ADULTS THAT HAVE SOME COLLEGE UNITS BUT NOT A BE A OR B. S.. THEY WANT TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL FINISH THAT DEGREE IN ADVANCE IN THEIR CAREERS ARE SHIPPED TO NEW ONES. ACCORDING TO THE LUMINA FOUNDATION THERE ARE FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WITH SOME COLLEGE CREDIT BUT NO DEGREE. THERE'S A HUGE UNTAPPED POTENTIAL HERE FOR THE STATE FOR ITS ECONOMY AND ESPECIALLY FOR THE STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THIS IS A POPULATION THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO SERVE UP WE ARE TO CLOSE THE ONE POINT ONE MILLION BACHELOR'S DEGREE GAP. WE KNOW ABOUT THE PROBLEMS. BUT HOW ABOUT SOME SOLUTIONS. CB ONLINE WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TEN AS A SEPARATE OPERATING DIVISION FROM THE MAIN CAMPUS. WE CALL IT A UNIVERSITY WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY. THE DIVISION HAS IT'S OWN FACULTY ADMINISTRATION ADMISSIONS RETENTION ASSESSMENT AN OPERATING BUDGET. THIS ALLOWED CB YOU TO HIRE A TEAM OF PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY ON THE ONLINE ON THE ON THE ADULT STUDENT. THIS SET UP THE CONDITIONS FOR SUCCESS. IN TWENTY TEN THERE WERE JUST OVER FIVE HUNDRED DEGREE COMPLETION STUDENTS WHO WERE OFFERED TWELVE MAJORS. AND CONCENTRATIONS THAT WERE HOUSED IN THE VARIOUS SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES ON OUR MAIN CAMPUS. THESE REMOVED UNDER THE OVERSIGHT OF THESE WERE MOVED AND MOVED ON TO THE OVERSIGHT OF CEBU ONLINE. AND SEVEN AND A HALF YEARS LATER. CV ONLINE SERVICES JUST UNDER FOUR THOUSAND STUDENTS AND NOW OFFERS FORTY TWO MAJORS IN CONCENTRATIONS. THAT INCLUDE FOURTEEN MASTER'S PROGRAMS AND TO DOCTOR PROGRAMS. WE NOW HAVE TWENTY SIX MAJORS AT THE BACHELORS LEVEL AND THAT CONTINUES TO GROW EACH YEAR. MOST IMPORTANT OUR FOCUS ON STUDENT ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN FACULTY AND STUDENTS HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT RETENTION. AND PERSISTENT RATES FOR ADULT ONLINE STUDENTS. THE SIX YEAR GRADUATION RATE FOR PRIVATE NOT FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS. YOU THESE YOUR U. S. INSTITUTIONS IN THE SAME CARNEGIE CLASSIFICATION THE CB YOU. MASTERS LARGE PROGRAMS. THAT OFFER ALL PROGRAMS COMPLETELY VIA DISTANCE EDUCATION THE AVERAGE. IS TWENTY SIX POINT THREE PERCENT. CBO ONLINE IS SIXTY FIVE POINT TWO PERCENT. FIRST A SECOND YEAR COHORT RETENTION RATES FOR U. S. INSTITUTIONS IN THE SAME CARNEGIE CLASSIFICATION. IS FORTY TWO POINT SEVEN PERCENT CBO ONLINE IS SEVENTY ONE POINT TWO. AS CBO IS A HISPANIC SERVING INSTITUTION. THIRTY NINE POINT THREE PERCENT OF CBO ONLINE IN THIS IS JUST THE DIVISION NOT THE OVERALL CBO THAT'S EVEN MORE. THIRTY NINE PER THIRTY NINE POINT THREE PERCENT OF CBO ONLINE ARE HISPANIC WITH THE RETENTION RATE THAT WE'RE VERY PROUD OF OF SIXTY NINE POINT TWO PERCENT THESE ARE ADULT STUDENTS. TOTAL MINORITY POPULATION IS SIXTY THREE POINT THREE PERCENT AT CEBU ONLINE. AND FIRST TO SECOND YEAR COHORT RETENTION RATES FOR THIS GROUP IS SIXTY EIGHT POINT FIVE PERCENT. WHEN THE CONDITIONS FOR SUCCESSFUL PRESIDENT YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH MUCH FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. A MORE RECENT EXAMPLE OF WAYS THAT A I SEE SIEU SCHOOLS CAN HELP CLOSE THE GAP. IS AN EXAMPLE OF CBO LINES FAST TRACK TO SUCCESS PROGRAM THAT WE DEVELOPED ORIGINALLY WITH MOUNT SAN JACINTO COLLEGE. AND CBO ONLINE AND NOW HAS GROWN TO A PARTNERSHIP WITH NINETEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WITH OVER EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY STUDENTS CURRENTLY ENROLLED AND JUST UNDER AN ADDITIONAL NINE HUNDRED STUDENTS WHO ARE CURRENTLY EXPLORING THE PROGRAM. NOT ONLY IS THIS PROGRAM EXTREMELY TRANSFER FRIENDLY WITH ADMISSION GUARANTEES. BUT INCLUDES INSTITUTIONAL SCHOLARSHIPS BY CBO ONLINE TO EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN FOR STUDENTS TO COMPLETE THEIR BACHELOR'S DEGREE. THE. US SIGNIFICANT TUITION DISCOUNTING ALSO. WITH THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM REALLY MAKES IT VERY COST EFFECTIVE. FAIRLY CLOSE TO WHAT A STUDENT AND ADULTS STUDENT WOULD BE PAYING. AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. I THINK THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR SYNERGY BETWEEN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FULLY ONLINE HUNDRED AND FIFTEENTH COMMUNITY COLLEGE. IF THE SKATE STATE DOES INDEED GO THAT ROUTE. THE FAST TRACK TO SUCCESS PROGRAM AS AN EXAMPLE THAT THERE CAN BE POTENTIAL FOR A STRONG PIPELINE FOR NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS. IN CLOSING I'D WANNA MENTION TWO POINTS. THERE IS NO FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM TARGETED THIS GROUP OF STUDENTS THE NONTRADITIONAL STUDENT WANTS TO COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE. EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF AID FROM THE STATE WOULD HELP THEM GO. BACK AND PAY DIVIDENDS FOR THE STATE IN THE LONG RUN THROUGH INCREASED INCOME AND SPENDING. SECONDLY I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE HESITANCY AROUND ONLINE EDUCATION. WELL THERE CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN SOME BAD ACTORS IN THE FOR PROFIT ARENA. AND FOR ALL IF WE'RE REALLY HONEST IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR AS WELL. THERE ARE MANY A I SEE SIEU SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS WHO LIKE CBO ONLINE. HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT ONLINE AND HYBRID EDUCATION CAN BE DONE WELL. ONCE AGAIN OF THE CONDITIONS FOR SUCCESSFUL THERE TOGETHER WE CAN DO GREAT THINGS. THE STUDENTS OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. OKAY THANK YOU. QUESTION. YES MISTER VOEPEL. THE TRYING TO BURN THROUGH THIS MISTER CHAIR BUT. GOT A FEW THINGS TO SAY HER ARM. I DID A TO TOURISM VIETNAM. AND WHEN I. WITH ALL THE NORMAL VETERAN COMBAT PROBLEMS. ON. I HAD TO GET A JOB. AND EVERYONE TOLD ME TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE OTHERWISE I'D BE LOST. WELL. I TOOK THAT ADVICE AND. MANY MANY PEOPLE HELP ME ALONG MY WAY FOR WHAT'S OF FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE I WOULDN'T BE SITTING HERE. SO I GREATLY APPRECIATE THE SYSTEM. EVERYONE IS BUILT FOR MANY YEARS IT HAS BENEFITTED ME. MY DISTRICT. IS. MIDDLE AND LOW INCOME. LOW CLASS. MIDDLE CLASS. PEOPLE IN URBAN AREAS AND A LARGE PORTION OF RULE AREAS AND WE HAVE ALSO A LARGE. POPULATION OF REFUGEES. SO ONCE AGAIN COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE MY FIRST LOVE. I GREATLY APPRECIATE DID. THE UC AND CSU SYSTEM AND EVERYTHING THEY'VE BEEN DOING AND THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN A STAUNCH SUPPORTER UP AND DOWN THE LINE FOR EVERYONE SO. WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD BECAUSE YOU'RE WORKING HARD. I DO HAVE SOME. COMMENTS AND OUT SORT OUT WITH A RHETORICAL QUESTION. DUE TO THE HIGH COST OF LIVING A REAL ESTATE IN CALIFORNIA. WHY SHOULD ANY OF OUR? BACHELOR DEGREE GRADUATES STAY IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT BACHELOR DEGREE GRADUATES WOULD WANT TO COME HERE FROM OTHER STATES? THAT IS. BOTH SEVERE RHETORICAL QUESTION. IF WE HAVE A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF BACHELORS DEGREE EMPLOYEES I'M LOOKING AT THIS NOW FROM THE EMPLOYER VIEWPOINT. EMPLOYERS MUST ADD INCENTIVES TO THE EMPLOYMENT PACKAGE TO ATTRACT. CALIFORNIA OR OUT OF STATE GRADUATES. THAT'S A TREMENDOUS HANDICAP IN THE OPEN MARKETPLACE. BECAUSE WE CAN DO THE BEST JOB IN THE WORLD EDUCATING THESE PEOPLE AND IF THEY CAN'T GET A JOB WERE LIVING CALIFORNIA WE'RE IN DEEP TROUBLE. PERSONAL OBSERVATION I WAS IN A BUILDING. WHEN I WAS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR CORPORATE SECTOR. I WAS IN A BUILDING WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED HIGH TECHNOLOGY PEOPLE MOST OF THEM WERE P. H. D.'S AND BACHELORS MASTERS EXCEPT FOR. EXCEPT FOR THEY WEREN'T FROM AMERICA OUT OF TWO HUNDRED AT LEAST A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY WHERE FROM INDIA NIGERIA TAIWAN. ALL OVER THE WORLD. AND THE REASON THEY WERE THERE IS A WERE DOING THE SAME JOB AS OUR GRADUATES. BUT THE CORPORATIONS IN THE COMPANIES TO PUT SIX SEPARATE IN A THREE BEDROOM. UNIT. WORLD. LESSON LEARNED THEIR. SO. THIS COMMITTEE AND YOU WE ARE NOT JUST TRYING TO EDUCATE PEOPLE AND GET THEM GRADUATED. WE HAVE TO GAINFULLY EMPLOY HIM AND COMPETE. DRAMATICALLY AGAINST THE WHOLE REST THE WORLD. MANY OF. THE BACHELOR DEGREE HOLDERS CAN WORK OUT OF STATE AND STILL DATA COMMUTE WITH THE SILICON VALLEY BUSINESSES SO IT ISN'T JUST A LITTLE EMPLOYER. MANY MANY COMPANIES NOW ARE DOING AWAY WITH CALL CENTERS THE CALL CENTERS ARE SIMPLY. THE TRAINING CENTERS AND EVERYONE'S WORKING OUT A STATE OUT OF THEIR HOUSES EXCEPT ROOM ONCE I GET TRAINED UP. THAT'S GOING TO REFLECT ALSO ON OUR BACHELOR MASTER AND P. H. D.'S. SO THE WHOLE TECHNOLOGY. CHANGE IN IN THE WORLD. BRICK AND MORTAR ISN'T MAKING IT. I'M. BRICK AND MORTAR. PEOPLE CAN BE WAREHOUSED OR WORK REMOTELY FROM ANYWHERE IN THE BILL WORLD. SO NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE TO COMPETE WITH OUR OWN PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES WE'RE COMPETING WITH THE WORLD. NOT LIKE THE TRANSITION JUST BRIEFLY. TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. COMMUNITY COLLEGE GRADS IN VOCATIONAL GRADS. THEY WORK IN CALIFORNIA. THEY GENERALLY DON'T DATA COMMUTE REMOTELY THEY ARE PLUMBERS ELECTRICIANS. SELL TECHNICIANS ALL THAT STUFF AND I LIKE TO CALL THEM. TONGUE IN CHEEK NOT SILICON VALLEY BUT RED CLAY VALLEY. OKAY THEIR HER NOT COMMUNITY THERE HERE DOING STUFF RIGHT HERE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. OUR THEIR BABIES THAT'S THEIR MOM AND DAD OKAY. AND I'M FINALLY SILICON VALLEY HAS ITS CHALLENGES IN ARE BASIC ECONOMY ALSO HAS CHALLENGES. A BASIC ECONOMY. MUST HAVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AA GRADUATES TO RUN SMALL BUSINESSES EMPLOY OTHER HIGH SCHOOL COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND. HIGHER DEGREES. IT'S INTERESTING BICU GOT A SHEET METAL SHOP IN YOUR SUCCESSFUL NOVEL SON YOU HAVE SIXTY EIGHTY EMPLOYEES YOU'RE HIRING THAT MBA. TO HELP YOU. VERY INTERESTING HOW THIS STUFF WORKS. I'M. SO. I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THIS LAST STATEMENT. IT MY DISTRICT THE DEGREE GAP IS BETWEEN HIGH SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND THAT IS PROBABLY. OF FAIR AMOUNT. OF THE INLAND EMPIRE IN MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS THERE OUTSIDE THE LARGER URBAN AREAS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTARY.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MCCARTY TREM MEDINA MEMBERS. MARIO GUERRERO BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT AS THE PP I SEE ESTIMATED WE ARE LOCKING OVER ONE MILLION GRADUATE SHORT. BY TWENTY THIRTY AND WE HOPE THAT IT'S NOT LOST ON LEGISLATORS ARE THAT THE CSU TURNED AWAY THIRTY ONE THOUSAND QUALIFIED STUDENTS THIS PAST YEAR DUE TO FUNDING. THIS TREND. WILL ONLY GET WORSE WITHOUT ACTION. TOWARDS THE VERY END OF THE ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER ADMINISTRATIVE GOVERNORSHIP AND THROUGH THE TENURE OF GOVERNOR BROWN BOTH THE CSU AND THE SUIT AND THAT YOU SEE HAVE A BEGUN TURNING AWAY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF QUALIFY CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ANNUALLY. THIS IS A CRISIS FOR CALIFORNIA'S LONG TERM ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL WELL BEING. AS YOU'RE AWARE THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED UNDER FUNDING THE CSU WITH NINETY TWO MILLION. DOLLARS WHILE THE CSU REQUESTED TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION. ARE SEE AFFAIRS RECOMMENDING FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO POINT SIX MILLION. OUR REQUEST OF REQUESTED FUNDING LEVEL WILL INCREASE. STUDENT ADMISSIONS BY MORE THAN EIGHTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS EVEN WITH THIS AMOUNT. WE WOULD STILL BE TURNING AWAY THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS SEE AFFAIRS REPORT. EQUITY INTERRUPTED HAS SHOWN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM EDUCATES A FAR MORE DIVERSE STUDENT BODY. TODAY THAN IT DID THIRTY YEARS AGO AND THAT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS OF COLOR HAS INCREASED WHILE A PUBLIC FUNDING FOR THE CSU HAS DECREASED AS I A CHAIR MEDINA MENTIONED. SO IN CLOSING. TO CLOSE THE DEGREE GAP WE SHOULD START BY ENSURING THAT ALL OF THE QUALIFY CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE TRANSFER STUDENTS. ACTUALLY GET ADMITTED TO A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU FOR THE YEAH THAT THE PUBLIC COMMENT THAT CHAIRMAN DEAN AND I WANT TO THANK THE ARE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN A WHERE KNOW THAT WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE NO EASY ANSWERS.
