ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TODAY'S TUESDAY FEBRUARY THIRTEENTH TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. WE DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM BUT WE WILL OPERATE AS A SUB COMMITTEE WE HAVE. TWO ITEMS ON THE AGENDA TO BE HEARD TO RESOLUTIONS AND ONE BILL THAT IS ON THE PROPOSED CONSENT AGENDA. SO WILL START WITH ITEM NUMBER TWO. SCR SEVENTY EIGHT SENATOR JACKSON. AND MY CHAIR LEFT TO RIGHT. THAT'S. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PERCENT SCR SEVENTY EIGHT. THIS IS. SOMETIMES KNOWN AS THE CEDAW BILL WHICH CALLS FOR THE COMMISSION. OF FOR THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION ACTUALLY THE CONVENTION I BELIEVE IT IS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN. S. MEASURE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THERE IS A CONTINUED NEED. FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. PROTECT THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS IN TO ANALYZE THE OPERATIONS OF STATE DEPARTMENT'S POLICIES AND PROGRAMS. TO IDENTIFY DISCRIMINATION. AND IF IT IS IDENTIFIED TO REMEDY THAT DISCRIMINATION. THIS MEASURE URGES THE STATE TO SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING SEA DOT. THIS WAS SET UP. A MEASURE THAT FIRST WAS INTRODUCED BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. KNOWN AS THE INTERNATIONAL BILL OF RIGHTS FOR WOMEN. IT IS THE FIRST AND ONLY INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENT THE COMPREHENSIVELY ADDRESSES WOMEN'S RIGHTS WITHIN POLITICAL CULTURAL ECONOMIC SOCIAL. AND FAMILY LIFE AND SINCE EVERY COUNTRY IS DIFFERENT. SEE DAHLE PROVIDES A A A GENERALIZED BLUEPRINT. FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO OVERCOME THE REMAINING BARRIERS OF DISCRIMINATION THAT EXIST. IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES ARE IN THE WORLD THAT IT DEFINES WHAT CONSTITUTES DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN. AND SETS UP AN AGENDA FOR NATIONAL ACTION TO END THAT DISCRIMINATION. THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. IS ONE OF ONLY SEVEN NATIONS THAT HAVE NOT RATIFIED THIS INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT. WHICH IS VITAL HAS PROVEN VITAL TO ADDRESSING DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN AND GIRLS. I WANNA LISTS THIS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS STARTLED ME FOR QUITE SOME TIME ONE OF SEVEN. THE OTHER SIX. THE PACIFIC ISLAND NATIONS OF TONGA IN PALAU. THE VATICAN IRAN. SOMALIA. IN THE SUDAN. ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA'S A NATIONAL LEADER WHEN IT COMES TO EQUAL RIGHTS FOR WOMEN THERE IS STILL MUCH WORK TO BE DONE ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL. WOMEN CONTINUE TO BE PAID LESS THAN MEN ACROSS VIRTUALLY ALL OCCUPATION CATEGORIES. VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN THE SYSTEMIC. THE RAPE CULTURE CONTINUES TO PERVADE LIVES OF WOMEN OF ALL AGES. AND THE RIGHT TO LIVE WITH DIGNITY. FREEDOM FROM SHAME OR FEAR CONTINUES TO BE COMPROMISED. THIS RESOLUTION PASSED THE SENATE FLOOR WITH UNANIMOUS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. IT'S A MEASURE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT. OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES WITH REGULARITY IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA JOINT MOST OF THE REST OF THE WORLD. BUT IF THEY'RE NOT PREPARED TO DO THAT AND I WOULD SUSPECT IN TODAY'S WORLD WE ARE EVEN FARTHER AWAY FROM IT THAT WE WERE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US AS ONE OF THE LEADERS. TO ENDORSE THIS EFFORT AND TO SUPPORT IT AND I HAVE. WITH ME TODAY MY A PRINCIPAL CHO AUTHOR WHO REPRESENTS THE US CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO WHICH HAS TAKEN THE LEAD IN THIS EFFORT AND IS IN FACT. BEEN WORKING TO IDENTIFY THOSE AREAS WHERE THERE IS. OF THIS INEQUITY. I HE WILL SPEAK AND THEN. WE HAVE TODAY ELIZABETH NEWMAN WORKPLACE POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO'S DEPARTMENT. ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN TO SAY A FEW WORDS IN ANSWERING THE QUESTION. THANK YOU FIRST WE'RE GONNA ESTABLISH A QUORUM CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE HERE CUNNINGHAM HERE CHAO. YOU HEAR. BONTA. HOLDEN. KALRA. KILEY. MAIENSCHEIN. GRACE. THANK IT WE DO OF COURSE. TO TWO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND. TO OUR GOOD SENATOR AND ARE. SENATE CHAIR COLLEAGUE. THANK YOU FOR. HELPING TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. I AM A PRINCE WILL CO AUTHOR OF THIS MEASURE IN PART BECAUSE LAST YEAR I WAS ASKED BY WOMEN LEADERS IN MY CITY TO MOVE. THIS RESOLUTION FORD SAN FRANCISCO HAS ALWAYS BEEN A POWER IT LEADER IN WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT OUR CITY BECAME THE FIRST CITY IN THE WORLD TO ENACT A LOCAL ORDINANCE THAT REFLECTED THE PRINCIPLES OF CIDA. AND A FEW YEARS AGO TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN ARE THE LATE MAYOR MAYOR LEE LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN CALLED CITIES PROCEED OFF. A AUTHORING A RESOLUTION WHICH WAS ADOPTED UNANIMOUSLY BY THE US CONFERENCE OF MAYORS THE CHALLENGE MAYORS OF OTHER CITIES TO ENACT MEASURES SIMILAR TO THE C. DAHLE ORDINANCE THAT WE HAVE IN SAN FRANCISCO. TO DATE OVER SIXTY CITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND OUR COUNTRY HAVE FOLLOWED SUIT. A I ALSO. NOTE WHEN WE STARTED TO RESEARCH ON THIS WE REALIZED HOW MUCH LEADERSHIP ARE ARE. THE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE SENATE JUDICIARY HAD LET ON THAT SO I APPROACHED HER AND. AND SHE WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE YOUR DECADES LONG FIGHT IN THIS AND I AM HAPPY TO BE ALONG FOR THE RIDE. BUT I JUST WANNA ALSO NOTE THAT WE STARTED THIS CONVERSATION. BEFORE THE ME TOO MOVEMENT BEFORE ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE ARISEN IN RECENT MONTHS BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE A MORE TIMELY RESOLUTION FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD. ARE AT THIS MOMENT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US AS A STATE TO CONTINUE TO BE A BEACON OF HOPE ON THESE ISSUES. AYE AS WAS MENTIONED BY. CHAIRWOMAN. HANNAH BETH JACKSON THE FACT THAT THE FEW JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAVE NOT RATIFIED THIS ARE ARE THE ONES THAT THEY ARE NOT WE ARE NOT IN GOOD COMPANY AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET OFF THAT LIST GET ONTO THE RIGHT LIST AND CONTINUE. TO SHOW OUR LEADERSHIP NOT JUST AS A STATE BUT AS A COUNTRY. THANK YOU. WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS THAT THE RESOLUTION BE ADOPTED. FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING I'M ELIZABETH NEWMAN FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN I'M CIDA IS NOT JUST ABOUT NAMING EQUAL RIGHTS FOR WOMEN AND GIRLS IT PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK TO. IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS INEQUALITY AND SINCE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND SAN FRANCISCO CEDAW HAS PUSHED GREATER INTERAGENCY PARTNERSHIPS AND IMPROVE PUBLIC SERVICES IN SAN FRANCISCO. IT IS A MATTER OF GOOD GOVERNMENT TO KNOW WHO IS BEING SERVED AND HOW WELL THEY ARE BEING SERVED. WE HAVE MONITORED THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF COMMISSIONERS AND BOARD MEMBERS AND SAN OF POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES. AND AFTER A DECADE OF REPORTS WOMEN ARE NOW HALF OF APPOINTEES. A BUT WHITE MEN ARE STILL OVERREPRESENTED AND ASIAN AND LATINO ACTS MEN AND WOMEN ARE UNDER REPRESENTED. WHEN THE CITY AND COUNTY FACED A THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT IN TWO THOUSAND THREE. A GENDER ANALYSIS OF BUDGET CUTS BY CITY DEPARTMENTS IDENTIFIED THE DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON WOMEN PARTICULARLY WOMEN OF COLOR. A IN THE PROPOSED LAYOFFS AND REDUCTION OF SERVICES. MORE THAN A DECADE OF INTENSE FOCUS ON POLICY REFORMS CROSS AGENCY COLLABORATION AND EXPANDING DIRECT SERVICES TO SURVIVORS LEAD TO A RECORD FORTY FOUR MONTHS WITHOUT A SINGLE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOMICIDE IN SAN FRANCISCO. THE SEE TOUGH FRAMEWORK HAS BROUGHT TOGETHER POLICE OFFICERS ANTI DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ADVOCATES JUDGES AND DEPARTMENT HEADS TO SAVE WOMEN'S LIVES. THERE ARE MANY AREAS OF WOMEN'S GIRLS LIVES WHERE DESPITE ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS EQUALITY IS NOT A REALITY. BUT WITH THIS FRAMEWORK AND THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF OUR SUCCESSES WOMEN AND GIRLS TAXPAYERS AND POLICY MAKERS HAVE ALL. BEEN BETTER SERVED IN SAN FRANCISCO BECAUSE OF CIDA. THIS RESOLUTION WOULD ENSURE THAT THE STATE NOT ONLY SUPPORTS THE RIGHT OF WOMEN TO FULLY PARTICIPATE IN POLITICAL AND PUBLIC LIFE THE RIGHT OF EDUCATION EMPLOYMENT HEALTH. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BENEFITS BUT IT ALSO COMMITS TO THE PRINCIPLES OF CIDA BY COLLECTING DATA MONITORING PROGRESS. AND INFORMING POLICIES TO BETTER SERVE ALL CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU WOULD ANYONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. IT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMON. ISRAEL. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR. AND MY COLLEAGUE FOR PRESENTING THIS I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO SHED LIGHT WHEN WE HAVE THE INEQUITIES THAT WE HAVE THE. THE THE ELECT INEQUALITIES TO SHED LIGHT I APPRECIATE THAT THE SUPPORT. SEVERANCE CISCO'S VERY WELL REPRESENTED THERE. BOB I'M SURE THAT OTHER CITIES. THAT NEED TO STEP UP TO THAT BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. RIGHT A THE QUESTIONS COME. SINGER CENTER YOU MAKE LOVE IT'S THANK YOU AND. I DO APPRECIATE THE REFERENCE TO. A THE EMERGENCE OF VARIOUS MOVEMENTS INCLUDING ME TO WHICH. EXPRESS THE FRUSTRATION ABOUT WOMEN BEING TREATED. UNEQUALLY I THINK A LOT OF THIS IS PERHAPS A UNDER THE RADAR IS NOT CONSCIOUSLY INTENDED. THE PURPOSE OF SITAR IS TO BRING TO THE FORE. OF THE VARIOUS ISSUES THE VARIOUS BUDGET INEQUITIES THE VARIOUS CONSEQUENCES ALL OF THE KINDS OF. PERHAPS UNINTENDED UNCONSCIOUS BIASES THAT EXISTS SO I DON'T LOOK AT THIS IS. FINGER POINTING ANYWHERE THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO GET INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN REDRESS AND SOLVE THESE INEQUITIES THAT ARE. PROBABLY IS SOLD THIS TIME AND. I THINK MY GOOD COLLEAGUE OF. FROM SAN FRANCISCO I THINK THE PEOPLE OF SAN FRANCISCO DEMONSTRATED THAT YOU CAN'T FIX WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW WAS WRONG. AND THIS IS A MEASURE TO PUT A MAGNIFYING GLASS TO VARIOUS TYPES OF PROGRAMS. WHERE THERE'S NO ASSUMPTION THAT THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG EXCEPT FOR EXAMPLE WE SEE THE HIGH LEVEL OF HOMICIDES THAT HAVE EXISTED AND I IN RELATIONSHIP VIOLENCE WORDS WOMEN WHO ARE PREDOMINANTLY THE VICTIMS? AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS WORST THE FUNDING COMING FROM WHERE'S THE FUNDING GOING IS IT MEETING THE NEEDS TO WE HAVE FULL REPRESENTATION AT THE TABLE. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A MORE EQUAL WORLD.

I HOPE WE CAN NO THE RESOLUTION FORWARD AND DELIVER A RESOUNDING MESSAGE OF SUPPORT TO THE SALVADOREAN REPRESENTATIVES ARE DELEGATION WILL BE MEETING WITH TOMORROW AND THE DAYS TO COME. THAT'S AMENDED HR SIX NINE WILL NOT ONLY CALL FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO REVERSE HIS VERY MISGUIDED DECISION TO TERMINATE THE TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS. ALSO KNOWN US TPS. OF SALVADORIAN SEEKING REFUGE IN THE UNITED STATES BUT IT ALSO URGES THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS TO FIND A LEGISLATIVE PATH. TO PERMANENT LEGAL STATUS FOR THE SALVADORAN. THE A TPS DESIGNATION FOR SALVADORIAN AS WAS ORIGINALLY EXTENDED IN TWO THOUSAND ONE BY PRESIDENT. GEORGE W. BUSH THE DESIGNATION HAS BEEN CONTINUOUSLY RENEWED BY BOTH REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS AND RECOGNITION. OF THE DIRE CONDITIONS THE SALVADORANS FACED BACK HOME. SALVADORIAN SO WITH TPS HAVE LIVED AND WORKED IN THIS COUNTRY SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE THEY ARE PARENTS TO APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND. US BORN CHILDREN WHO HAVE GROWN UP CALLING THIS COUNTRY HOME. THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES WILL BE TORN APART. BY THIS SENSELESS UNNECESSARY ACTION. CALIFORNIA ITSELF IS HOME TO FORTY NINE THOUSAND SALVADORANS PROTECTED BY TPS AND AS THE ONLY MEMBER OF THIS LEGISLATURE FROM EL SALVADOR. I UNDERSTAND THEIR PLIGHT. QUITE PERSONALLY. AND CAN ASSURE YOU THESE PEOPLE ARE HARD WORKING DETERMINE AND PRODUCTIVE PRESENCE IN OUR STATE. EIGHTY PERCENT OF THIS POPULATION AS AN ACTOR PART OF OUR WORK FORCE AND A QUARTER OF THEM PAY MORTGAGES. IF THEY ARE REMOVED OR FORCED INTO HIDING IT WILL BE A DEVASTATING BLOW. TO THE PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY AND FREEDOM THIS COUNTRY STANDS FOR. THANK YOU AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS RESOLUTION HERE WITH ME AT THE TABLE TODAY IS CHRISTOPHER GALIANO WHO IS WITH THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRATION POLICY CENTER. AND CHRISTOPHER SANCHEZ WHO IS WHAT CHAIR LET THE COALITION OF HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS. BECKY FIRST WITH THIS PLACE NOBODY MEMBER I CHAIR MEMBERS CUTS FOR SPONSORS WITH CHAIR OF THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS WE STRONGLY STAND SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION AND OFF FOR SEVERAL REASONS. AS AYE AYE MEMBER ORGANIZATION OF THE NATIONAL TPS ALLIANCE WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WITH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS IN THE U. S. SENATE. SENSE I WE'VE HEARD TALKS ABOUT THE REMOVAL FOR TPS STATUS FOR A DIFFERENT COUNTRIES INCLUDING ALL SALVADORAN. HOW WE KNOW THAT THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE GPS ARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ARE PEOPLE THAT GO THROUGH EXTENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS AND ARMED BE FOR THE PURPOSE THAT EVERY TIME THEY HAVE TO? RENEW THEIR TPS THAT IS RECONSIDERED ITS NOT JUST READ GRANTED TO THEM SO THAT IS I WANT ONE REASON THOUGH AMONG THE ARE MANY REASONS. BUT ARM ABSOLUTELY ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO PASS THIS RESOLUTION IN ADDITION TO SEND A STRONG ASSETS TO. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A PATHWAY OB FOR RESIDENCY CITIZENSHIP OP FOR THE THIS POPULATION. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT IT'S FOR CHRISTOPHER GONNA FROM THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER ECHOING THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHAIR LEFT. THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS HAVE LIVED IN THE U. S. I'VE DESIGNATED GPS DATA SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE AS THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN STATED THAT CONTRIBUTED MILLIONS TO THE ECONOMY. AND THEY'VE RAISED A FAMILY CHILDREN LOTS OF MANY OR WHO ARE ALL US CITIZENS THAT CHILDREN. ARM IT WAS A CRUEL HEARTLESS DECISION TO END TPS. IT LEAVES A LOT OF FAMILIES. IN UNCERTAINTY AND AND LIVING WITH ANXIETY AND FEAR AS WELL. AND SO WAS MY WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION. AND AIR CHAIR SUPPORT AS WELL IN THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND WHAT ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. I'D SAY NOT A BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SYRIANA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. IT IT IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND. S. OTHERWISE UNINTERESTING COUNTRY ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRAVEL THERE AND IN. THE REASON THAT SO MANY OF SALVADORANS ARE HERE IS BECAUSE OF THE DANGER THAT HAD BEEN THERE IN THAT COUNTRY AND AND SOME OF IT STILL REMAINS. BUT WHEN I WAS THERE UNDER THE SORT AND ADMINISTRATION THAT HAD THE CHANCE TO GO SEE SOME ENVIRONMENTAL WORK THERE TRYING TO DO. AND SOME OF THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE IN THEIR INNER CITIES OF THE MORE DANGEROUS PLACES. AND THEIR SCHOOLS THERE WERE THAT HAVE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF COMMUNITY AND PARENT. INVOLVEMENT. AND THAT THOSE CONNECTIONS THAT THEY'RE BUILDING IN THERE. MORE DIFFICULT AREAS IN THEIR CITIES ARE REALLY STARTING TO CHANGE THE LANDSCAPE THERE SO FOR THIS COUNTRY TO REMOVE TPS STATUS FOR EL SALVADORANS IT. AS THEY'RE TRYING TO. ADDRESS THE ISSUES IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY I THINK IS A VERY CYNICAL AND AND WRONG HEADED MOVE WE WE SHOULD ACTUALLY BE SUPPORTING THAT COUNTRY. AS THE UNITED STATES IN ORDER TO. TURN IT AROUND ADDRESS THE VIOLENCE ADDRESSTHE POVERTY ADDRESS THE REAL NEEDS THAT ARE THERE AND THE ADMINISTRATION THE CARTER ADMINSTRATION THAT. UNDER US AROUND HAS BEEN REALLY TRYING TO DO THAT. IN A STRONG WAY BUT THIS COUNTRY HAS NOT PARTNERED WITH THEM IN ANY SIGNIFICANT MANNER WHEN WHEN THIS IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY I THINK THAT THAT HAS BEEN MISSED AND NOW EXACERBATED BY REMOVING. GODDESS SO THIS IS A GOOD MESSAGE FOR US CALIFORNIA HAS QUITE A NUMBER OF THE EL SALVADORANS LIVING IN. IN CALIFORNIA SAID THIS IS A RELEVANT. ISSUE FOR US TO BE ADDRESSING GIVEN THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF OF OUR STATE AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE SO THANKS FOR BRINGING A FOR. AND WHAT ELSE LIKE TO. A COMET. LIKE YOU WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THE MOTION SECONDS AT THE RESOLUTION BE ADOPTED AS AMENDED. ENDING FURTHER. ALRIGHT. SINGER. YES IS CREE MIKLOS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS MISTER CHAIRMAN I. AND THANK YOU ALL FOR INDULGING ME FOR THIS IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST TIME I PERCENT OF THE NEW WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND SO I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS BUT FEEL QUITE AT HOME AND I THINK THIS FOR ME IT'S IT'S ALSO VERY PERSONAL ASPIN SALVADORIAN AND SHARING SOME OF. THE LIVED EXPERIENCES THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT AND HOW MY FAMILY CAME TO THE UNITED STATES FLEEING THE CIVIL WAR. AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION WHAT DETAINMENT DEPORTATION LOOKS LIKE WE TALK ABOUT CONTACTS. AS TO WHY CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO THE LARGEST SALVADORAN POPULATION OUTSIDE OF ALL SOLID. SO THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. OTHER. STONE BY STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM. CHOW.
