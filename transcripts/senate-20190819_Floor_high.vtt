JEWISH CAUCUS HISTORY MATTERS.

00:18:51.396 --> 00:18:51.897
TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT HISTORY

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:55.701
MATTERS. I WAS A TEACHER MY

00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:58.570
PAST LIFE AND- WHEN YOU LOOK

00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:01.740
BACK INTO THE HISTORY BOOKS.

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:04.243
MOST YOUNG PEOPLE LEARN IN

00:19:04.309 --> 00:19:05.277
FOURTEEN NINETY TWO COLUMBUS

00:19:05.344 --> 00:19:05.878
SAILED THE OCEAN BLUE AND ALL

00:19:05.944 --> 00:19:07.946
IS WELL AFTER THAT IN FACT

00:19:08.013 --> 00:19:09.948
THAT'S NOT THE CASE. AND I

00:19:10.015 --> 00:19:14.253
THINK. THIS MUCH CELEBRATION IS

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:15.721
WE HAVE TO DO AROUND THIS

00:19:15.787 --> 00:19:19.691
IMPORTANT DAY. CELEBRATIONS NOT

00:19:19.758 --> 00:19:20.192
ENOUGH THERE NEEDS TO BE

00:19:20.259 --> 00:19:23.462
RECTIFICATION. AND UNTIL WE

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:27.099
CHANGE. THE WAY WE TEACH YOUNG

00:19:27.165 --> 00:19:30.302
PEOPLE IN THIS STATE. AND

00:19:30.369 --> 00:19:31.870
STARTING WITH OUR OWN HOLIDAYS

00:19:31.937 --> 00:19:33.939
AND WHAT WE RECOGNIZE AS THE

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:37.776
TRUTH OF HISTORY. THESE

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:38.343
INJUSTICES WILL STILL NOT BE

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:42.014
RECTIFIED. AND I WOULD HOPE

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:45.384
PERHAPS IN FUTURE YEARS WHEN WE

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.053
PASSED SIMILAR RESOLUTIONS IN

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.921
FACT EVEN SOME OF THE

00:19:48.987 --> 00:19:50.856
ICONOGRAPHY HAVE THIS BUILDING

00:19:50.923 --> 00:19:52.691
STARTS TO SHIFT AND RECOGNIZE

00:19:52.758 --> 00:19:53.258
OUR HISTORY. I THINK OUT TO

00:19:53.325 --> 00:19:57.963
THAT ROTUNDA. WITH COLUMBUS.

00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:58.564
SITTING THERE BESTOWING QUEEN

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:02.434
ISABELLA AND THE CELEBRATIONS

00:20:02.501 --> 00:20:05.137
THAT ARE INHERENT IN THAT

00:20:05.203 --> 00:20:06.104
RECOGNITION AT THE CENTER PIECE

00:20:06.171 --> 00:20:09.875
OF THIS CAPITAL. I THINK.

00:20:09.942 --> 00:20:11.910
THAT'S CULTURE PROBABLY BELONGS

00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:15.047
MORE APPROPRIATELY IN A MUSEUM.

00:20:15.113 --> 00:20:19.985
BUT NOT AS A PLACE OF HISTORY.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.787
AND SO I HOPE TO WORK WITH OUR

00:20:21.853 --> 00:20:22.721
BROTHERS AND SISTERS NOT JUST

00:20:22.788 --> 00:20:23.555
IN THE NATIVE AMERICAN

00:20:23.622 --> 00:20:25.324
COMMUNITY BUT ACROSS THE STATE

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:26.892
ACROSS CULTURES ACROSS THE

00:20:26.959 --> 00:20:29.962
JEWISH CAUCUS AND SO MANY OTHER

WHAT THEY FELT WAS THE FOUNDING

00:24:44.749 --> 00:24:46.852
OF THIS COUNTRY VERSES OUR

00:24:46.918 --> 00:24:49.120
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND

00:24:49.187 --> 00:24:52.357
THE REASON THAT THE FOCUS WAS

00:24:52.424 --> 00:24:54.893
ON SIXTEEN NINETEEN IN AUGUST

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.428
ACTUALLY IT WAS THE FIRST SLAVE

00:24:56.494 --> 00:24:59.431
SHIP. THAT HIT THE UNITED

00:24:59.497 --> 00:25:04.202
STATES OR THE BLAND WE NOW CALL.

00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:06.304
AND THE ARTICLES THEY'RE

00:25:06.371 --> 00:25:08.139
THEY'RE VERY MOVING BUT THE

00:25:08.206 --> 00:25:14.145
THERE'S MUCH IN IT. ABOUT THE.

00:25:14.212 --> 00:25:16.114
LEGACY OF VIOLENCE THAT OUR

00:25:16.181 --> 00:25:19.417
COUNTRY STILL SUFFERS UNDER.

00:25:19.484 --> 00:25:19.985
AND I WAS STRUCK AGAIN BY IT

00:25:20.051 --> 00:25:25.257
TODAY. WITH THE SIGNING OF OUR

00:25:25.323 --> 00:25:26.925
ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER SPILLED

00:25:26.992 --> 00:25:28.793
GOVERNOR NEWSOME SIGNING AROUND

00:25:30.662 --> 00:25:33.999
DEADLY FORCE AND WE HAVE WE ARE

00:25:34.065 --> 00:25:37.836
VERY VIOLENT COUNTRY. AND WE

00:25:37.903 --> 00:25:39.271
OFTEN IS WORK WHY WHY ARE WE

00:25:39.337 --> 00:25:40.839
WHY DO WE HAVE MORE MASS

00:25:40.906 --> 00:25:42.173
SHOOTINGS WHY DO WE HAVE MORE

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.642
GUN VIOLENCE WHY DO WE HAVE SO

00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:46.044
MUCH OF THIS VIOLENCE SO

00:25:46.111 --> 00:25:48.380
IMBEDDED IN THE U. S. COMPARED

00:25:48.446 --> 00:25:50.749
TO ALMOST EVERY OTHER. ECONOMY

00:25:50.815 --> 00:25:54.386
OF OUR OF OUR CLAPPED AND DE

00:25:54.452 --> 00:25:55.053
THE WHOLE FOCUS OF THIS

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.555
MAGAZINE IS AROUND SLAVERY AS

00:25:57.622 --> 00:25:58.890
ONE EXPLANATION IN IT'S A

00:25:58.957 --> 00:26:01.259
SIGNIFICANT EXPLANATION BUT I

00:26:01.326 --> 00:26:03.728
THINK THAT WE HAVE TO ALSO

00:26:03.795 --> 00:26:06.564
INCLUDE OUR GENOCIDE. OF NATIVE

00:26:06.631 --> 00:26:08.867
AMERICANS IN THAT. IT IS

00:26:08.934 --> 00:26:12.370
EQUALLY AS VIOLENT OF HISTORY

00:26:12.437 --> 00:26:14.673
WHERE WE LITERALLY. MADE IT

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:20.712
LEGAL TWO AND GAVE REWARDS.

00:26:20.779 --> 00:26:22.280
JUST AS WE GAVE REWARDS AND

00:26:22.347 --> 00:26:24.149
MADE IT LEGAL TO KILL ESCAPED

00:26:24.215 --> 00:26:27.152
SLAVES WE GAVE REWARDS AND MADE

00:26:27.218 --> 00:26:27.652
IT LEGAL TO KILL NATIVE

00:26:27.719 --> 00:26:31.990
AMERICANS. AND WE ASSISTED OUR

00:26:32.057 --> 00:26:34.659
OWN GOVERNMENT ARMY PROVIDED

00:26:34.726 --> 00:26:37.295
NATIVE AMERICANS WITH A SMALL

00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:38.830
POX INFECTED BLANKETS FOR

00:26:38.897 --> 00:26:42.267
EXAMPLE. SO I THINK THAT WE CAN

00:26:42.334 --> 00:26:42.867
NEVER STOP REMINDING OURSELVES

00:26:42.934 --> 00:26:47.872
OF THESE. LEGACIES AND HOW THEY

00:26:47.939 --> 00:26:51.042
STILL IMPACT NOT ONLY NATIVE

00:26:51.109 --> 00:26:52.077
CALIFORNIANS TO NATIVE

AMERICANS WHO APPROACHED ME AND

00:27:20.538 --> 00:27:23.174
ASKED ME TO SEE WHETHER.

00:27:23.241 --> 00:27:25.043
