SHE IS. AND THE LAWS THAT HAS BEEN WORKING FOR OVER FORTY FIVE YEAR. ADVANCE OF PACKED WOMEN'S EQUALITY AND OPPORTUNITY. LONG WORK TO REMOVE THOSE BARRIERS PEOPLE TREATMENT. UP FOR WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE. WELL HERE AT THE LOW. I SENIOR COUNSEL. POLICY THAT WAS ADVOCATES THE STATE LEGISLATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND A HOST OF ISSUES FOR EQUAL PAY. RIGHT AS HE DISCRIMINATION BUNKS BICU IT'S US THEIR WORK SCHEDULE. BUT THE LAST FEW MONTHS BECAUSE OF THE. MUCH OF OUR WORK HAS BEEN SON WORK. EIGHT BUT. THERE'S. ARTISTS ENERGY OF THOSE EIGHT MOMENT. REAL CHANGE AND AND STOP INCREMENTS ACT OF. SO MY COLLEAGUE MY A RECOUP PROJECT WAS IT THE OTHER DAY AND SHE HAS BEEN INVOLVED WITH AFFECT TRIP. BUT PAST THAT ACCOUNTABILITY PROCESS. CONGRESS. I HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO A TALKING WITH LEGISLATORS AND I BOTH. ABOUT THEIR EFFORTS REPORT STATE LEGISLATOR THE SEA IS. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE WITH YOU TODAY. FORTUNATELY I DIDN'T YOU KNOW AND THE ISSUES BROWN SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT YOU. CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE ARE NOT UNIQUE THAT LET'S SAY ABOUT IT. THE CONCERNED YOU ARE GRAPPLING WITH THE PRIVILEGE AND SAT A TRUCK PARTS AND MANY OTHER STATES ARE ALSO GRAPPLING WITH YOUR SOME COMMON THEMES THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL XIN. ONE MAJOR THEME IF YOU'RE GONNA GET IT FOR REPORTING BREAST IT. A COMMON ISSUE THEY LET THEIR BODIES THAT OP. IT FAILURE CURRENT AND BACK IS. ARE LARGELY FOCUSED ON TRADE. THAT ARE NOT REGULARLY DO THINK THAT IF AT ALL. I'M NOT SEXUALLY. SO THESE ARE THINGS I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH. ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE THE THOUGHT WORK WORK ALL DAY. THESE PROBLEMS AND. GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY TO OFFER SOME RECOMMENDATIONS ON AND I AM PRINCIPLES FOR RESPONDING. THAT ADEQUATE SEIZE OUR HER SYSTEM. WHEN IT FIRST STARTED OUT. BY. WHAT IS THAT IT THE? TALKING ABOUT. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIX IT A LITTLE BIT OF A? PROBLEM CAN YOU MAYBE JUST SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I IT THE CONNECTIONS LAGGING A LITTLE SO IF YOU CAN JUST SLOW SLOW DOWN AS YOU SPEAK. THAT MIGHT HELP. BUT I UNDERSTAND YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEARLY. TIME EITHER O'DONNELL THAT'S OKAY IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT IT'S THE IT'S THE INTERNET OKAY THINKS. OKAY TRYING TO GET A GOOD BUT. THIS IS A. SO THEY'RE SAYING SEXUAL CRABGRASS LISBETH POWER. US SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS YOU DID IT. COURSE CULTURAL NORMS ABOUT APPROPRIATE BULL KATE YOUR. AND WORK FOR WOMEN AND MEN AND TO EXERT CONTROL OVER PEOPLE POWER IN THE WORKPLACE. THE WOMEN. BUT ITS COLOR IMMIGRANTS SEND US BATIK. NPOWER IMBALANCES ESPECIALLY CHEAP HERE. I THINK THIS WORKPLACE CUT. WHERE WE HAVE HIGH PROFILE ON? EIGHT PERCENT OF WHOM ARE MAN AND THEY INTERACT AS LOBBYISTS AGAIN LANDS AND YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE JUST STARTING OUT THEIR CAREER. SERVING AS LEGISLATURE. AND IN TERMS. I WONDER WHAT THE READER INTO SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS THE ONLY A MANIFESTATION POWER IMBALANCE. SEXUAL HARASSMENT OFTEN OAK OR IS IT THAT IS FURTHER ENTRENCHED BY OTHER FORMS OF SEX BUT. NATION LIKE PAID VACATION. ALSO HARASSMENT OFTEN CONTAIN IS OFFENSIVE CHO. BASED ON MULTIPLE IDENTITIES LIKE NATIONAL ASIAN SEX. NOT JUST SEX. AND MANY WOMEN EXPERIENCE CRESSMAN. COMBINATION. OF THEIR GREAT. S. OR THEIR DISABILITY IMPACT AND. SO IN SHORT SOCIAL MODESTO CURRENT AND YOU. LIVE BRING THIS UP BECAUSE CRAFT HOPE IS A BIG VOTE. HARASSED. LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO DO THAT YET THUNDER AND REYES AND ONLY IN THE WORKPLACE. WE URGE YOU TO ENSURE THAT ANY REFORMS THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT. I'M LOOKING FOR WHAT'S ALSO BUT I SHOULD CONNECTED. EVERYONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE RARE PICK. UP ALL FOR. NDA AND SEVERAL FOCUS. SOME RECOMMENDATIONS. AND REPORT. BUT AS FOR THE REPORTS. FOR ME I AM AND OTHER STATES. IT'S CLEAR THAT REFORMING THE PROCESS THE FORTY ABOUT HARASSMENT. I ALREADY. AND MANY OF VICTIMS A AND BYSTANDERS STRUGGLING WITH THE FACT THAT. CITIES RESPONSE. EVEN COMPLAIN THAT ARE EXCELLENT ARE OFTEN MEMBERS OR AT LEGAL COUNSEL OR MAYBE. OR STAFF MEMBER IS. KUDOS INJURIES ARE TOWARDS THE MEMBERS. THAT THEY ARE NECESSARY AN INDEPENDENT AND TO TEAM. AND THIS IS AN INTIMIDATING REPORTING STRUCTURE. BOTH. AND ONE THAT MANY PEOPLE DOWN. TO IMPARTIALLY AT HAND CLAIMS. SO THE LEGISLATURE COULD PROMOTE. OUR REPORTING. PEOPLE FEEL SAFE. GREEN BY SHARING OUR MULTIPLE BODIES WERE AT JEWEL. INCLUDING A BERKELEY AND A TRULY INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY. COULD A PERSON COULD REPORT HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION. BEYOND ONLY OF SUPERVISORS MIGHT BE THE HARASSER THE LEGISLATURE. EGGS ALSO PROVIDE A MECHANISM WHERE I CAN CLEAN AND SO GIVING. MEANINGFUL LEGAL AND NON LEGAL ADVICE AND SUPPORT THROUGHOUT. EXAMPLE OF THROUGH A A COUNSELING PROGRAM. MOREOVER AND SUPPORT GINGER THAT NON DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS. ARE NOT A PREREQUISITE TO BE COMPLAINED THAT OR A MANDATORY CONDITION ALMONDS WE HEAR ABOUT THIS A LOT BROADER WORKPLACE CONTEXT. WHAT'S FILE A CLAIM STUDY SHOULD. LET PEOPLE WHO ENGAGE A SHOW BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE THAT REALLY CLARITY IN. HOWEVER TELL YOU THAT. I'M AND MAKE EVERYBODY AWARE OF IT IS NOT IMPORTANT. TO PURGE OF. I THAT. AND THAT'S WHAT LED. IT MAKES. THE LACK OF CONCERN EXPANDABILITY IF YOU ADOPTED THIS STANDARD ONE CONSEQUENCE WHAT IF ACTIVIST. THIS IS A MAKERS WOULD REQUIRE LESS SEVERE FORMS OF HARASSMENT BECAUSE THEY WOULD FEEL IT'S ARE SUBSTANTIAL. AND THE PROCESS FORGET. I AM AND THAT IS ALSO AN ISSUE REPORTING THAT WE'VE. BEEN PEOPLE WILL BE RELUCTANT TO REPORT IF IT THE ONLY CONSEQUENCE. NATION. UP FOR. END UP FOR LEGISLATURE'S WE TALK ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. WE ALSO NEED ACCOUNTABILITY TO THE PUBLIC. AND THAT MEANS TRANSPARENCY. THING WE BUT THE THIS IS EACH OFFICE. BECAUSE NOT EVERY CLAIM OF DISCRIMINATION WILL RESULT IN IS THAT. OUR BOARD. HOWEVER WE WANT IT. DRIVE HOME ISN'T REPORT MUST PROTECT THE IDENTITY CONFIDENTIALITY OF. YOU BECAUSE REVEALING THE VICTIMS IDENTITIES REYES ALT. IT RETALIATION ADDRESS CONCERT BUT. I'M FOR IT FOR THE COMPLAINANTS INCLUDING BEING BLACKBALLED FROM JOBS BUT LEGISLATE. SO THANKS THE BALANCE A VICTIM PRIVACY AND AND TRANSPARENCY WHICH IS BUT BEFORE AND. AND IF IT IS CRUCIAL THAT IF TAXED FUNDS ARE USED LITTLE A CLAIM SOMETHING YOU. THINK IT WAS IN CONGRESS. THAT LEGISLATOR IF IT'S LIKE FUNDS USED LOOK. LEGISLATORS SHOULD PERSON. NUMBER. TRADE FOR FINALS EXPANDED ON HIS OR HER BEHALF. AND USE OF OFFICE FUND BY LATER PASTE ON ABOUT SHIFTING SO I. AND SO. I HAVE NEVER OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE IN MY RIGHT BRAIN TESTIMONY AND SOME GOING TO PREVENTION THOUGH I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER HEARING ON THAT ISSUE SPECIFICALLY CHRIS. AND THAT WILL HELP OFFICES ON AND THROUGH YOUR COAT RACK. IT DISCRIMINATION AT THE LEGISLATURE. AND AND IDENTIFY ANY FAILURES IN THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT ARE. TO PREVENT AN ADDRESS FOR MEDICINE NATIONS BUT BUT IF. IN OUR PRACTICE. WELL. I HOPE YOU'RE ABLE TO HEAR A. YEAH ME OKAY GIVEN THE CONNECTION ISSUES. THANK YOU AND IF YOU CAN. STAMBAUGH IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU AS WE GET TO THE OTHER TWO PANELISTS THAT WE MAY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU AT THE END. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO TO WENDY MUST SELL NOW. IT MORNING THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH ALL OF YOU TODAY I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I'M GLAD THAT WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE. OUR OPINIONS ON THIS TOPIC. I M. THE CHAIR PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION WHICH IS A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION. OF NEARLY THIRTEEN HUNDRED ATTORNEYS WHO REPRESENT WORKERS. AND DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT RETALIATION WAGING OUR WHISTLEBLOWER ANOTHER EMPLOYMENT MATTERS. I MEMBERS HELP PROTECT AND EXPAND THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF WORKING MEN AND WOMEN THROUGH-LITIGATION EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY. A I ALSO HAVE BEEN REPRESENTING PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS AND I'M AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOL OF LAW ALTHOUGH MY COMMENTS ARE. SILLY MY OWN. AND ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION ON THE BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOL OF LAW. BUT I THINK ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT. THIS PANEL NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND IS THE UNIQUE ASPECTS OF THIS WORKPLACE. SO EACH OF YOU EACH OF THE MEMBERS HAS THE ULTIMATE. HIRING AND FIRING AUTHORITY. IF SOMEONE IS IN YOUR WORKPLACE. WHO IS EXPERIENCING SAM OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR SEX DISCRIMINATION? OR IF THEY'RE BYSTANDER TO WITNESS TO SUCH ACTIONS. AND THEY WISH TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS. OR TRANSFER TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT OR TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER. POSITION THAT'S EXCEEDINGLY HARD IN THIS WORKPLACE IT'S UNIQUE FACTOR. OF THE CAPITAL. SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOUR WOMAN EXPERIENCING SEXUAL HARASSMENT. BY A MEMBER. WHERE YOU GO YOU CAN EASILY TRANSFER? ADDITIONALLY IF YOU'RE STAFFERS SEEING INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE COMMENTS THAT PERHAPS SHOULD BE MADE. I. THAT SORT OF CONDUCT. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO COME OUT. AND SAY THIS IS CONDUCT THAT SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF EASY. A MOBILITY IN THE CAPITAL. BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE FACTORS OF THIS WORKPLACE. INCLUDING THE DIFFICULTY TO DISCIPLINE MEMBERS. WHO HAVE ENGAGED IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION THAT REALLY HAS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AT THIS UNIQUE WORKPLACE? BECAUSE OF THAT I THINK YOU NEED EVEN MORE STRINGENT POLICIES PROCEDURES. AND THIS REALLY NEED TO BE A ZERO TOLERANCE WORKPLACE. AND THE REASON FOR THAT IN LARGE PART IS BECAUSE OTHERWISE PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO GO FORWARD. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE YEARS OF ENTRENCHED BEHAVIOR THAT DOESN'T COME TO THE FORE. UNTIL YOU END UP WITH MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS OF EGREGIOUS CONDUCT. SO THE FIRST THING I THINK THAT THIS. PANEL NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT IS THE UNIQUE FEATURES OF THIS PARTICULAR WORKPLACE WHICH IS UNLIKE OTHER STATE EMPLOYERS WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSFER. IF YOU'RE EXPERIENCING SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR RETALIATION IN THE WORKPLACE OR RIDE A RETURN TO OTHER. TATE EMPLOYMENT THAT'S WHY THIS HAS TO BE MORE STRINGENT AND THE INVESTIGATION POLICIES PROCEDURES HAVE TO BE FOLLOWED TO THE LETTER. THIS ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE DIFFERENTIAL IN POWER WHICH ALREADY EXISTS SO MEMBERS. IT AS ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE. A GREAT DEAL OF POWER THAT'S ENTRENCHED IN THEIR POSITIONAL READY. GIVEN THE UNIQUE FACTORS OF THIS WORKPLACE THAT POWER DIFFERENTIAL IS ONLY INCREASE. PART OF WHAT'S REQUIRED BY AN EMPLOYER WHETHER YOU LOOK AT THE LEGISLATURE SOME OTHER EMPLOYER. IS A PAST FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE IN REMEDY. ALLEGATIONS OF HARASSMENT IS LIKELY TO CONTRIBUTED ADDITIONAL HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE AND TO ENCOURAGE RETALIATION AGAINST THOSE WHO COMPLAIN. THAT WAS ACTUALLY THE HAWKINS VERSES HENNEPIN TECH CENTER CASE BUT I THINK IT REALLY SAYS WHAT WE ALL KNOW IS IF YOU ALLOW HARASSMENT TO FLOURISH. IT ENCOURAGES ADDITIONAL HARASSMENT AND IT ALSO ENCOURAGES RETALIATION FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO DO COME FOR OUR ATTENDED KATE THAT THERE'S. INAPPROPRIATE OR UNLAWFUL. CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE SOWHAT DO WE DO I'D LIKE TO A TOP TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF VERY SPECIFIC TANGIBLE WAYS TO ADDRESS THIS. ONE IS OF THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE FEATUREOF THIS WORKPLACE WHERE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT. UP TO FRANKLY COMPLAIN AND ALSO TO TRANSFER. THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS OF ONE YEARS ESPECIALLY EGREGIOUS. ON THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION AREA AND CHAOTIC BOMB. I HAVE TALKED ABOUT AND THERE IS BEFORE THIS BODY. US IT LEGISLATION WHICH WOULD INCREASE THAT STATUE OF LIMITATIONS TO THREE YEARS I THINK THAT THAT. HELPS ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES OF THE DIFFICULTY OF COMING FORWARD IN THE POWER DIFFERENTIAL. I THINK THAT'S CRITICAL. THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS. AND I'M GOING TO FORWARD ON REPORTS I WILL BE SHARING ANY ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND WORK PRODUCT INFORMATION I MAY HAVE. INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE. HOWEVER THERE HAD BEEN APPROACH OF REPORTS IN THE MEDIA REGARDING NO REHIRE CLAUSES WELL IF YOU HAVE A NO REHIRE CLAUSE IF YOU'VE BEEN SUBJECT TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE. WHERE DO YOU GO NOT ONLY DO NOT HAVE AN ABILITY TO IT TO TRANSFER BUT YOU'RE BASICALLY LOCKED OUT OF AN ENTIRE CAREER PATH? HE'S NO REHIRE CLAUSES SHOULD BE ILLEGAL AS A MATTER PUBLIC POLICY BUT PARTICULARLY IN THIS TYPE OF WORK PLACE WHERE THERE'S. THESE AGREE JUST POWER DIFFERENTIALS AND A LACK OF OPPORTUNITY. CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES IN THIS WORKPLACE ARE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT AND I THINK OUR AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY THE REASON FOR THAT IS. IF YOU HAVE A CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSE IT COVERS THE CONDUCT THAT'S HAPPENING IN THAT MEMBERS OFFICE IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO COME FORWARD IT'S HARD ENOUGH IF YOU'RE BY STANDARD TO SAY. OF WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING WHICH IS WHAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE BUT WHEN YOU HAVE THESE CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES YOU COULD BE BARRED AS A MATTER OF LAW FROM RAISING THIS. THEIR PARTICULAR TRANSPARENCY PROBLEMS WITH THIS BODY OF ELECTED OFFICIALS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING BUSINESS WITH THE LIGHT OF THE SUN. THESE CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES ARE AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY IN AGAINST. YOU KNOW BUT A. WHAT WE HOPE ALL OF OUR PUBLIC OFFICIALS ARE WHICH IS ACTING IN THE INTERESTS OF THE PUBLIC NOT IN THEIR OWN PRIVATE INTERESTS? ARBITRATION CLAUSES MRS BEEN IN THE MEDIA AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED BEFORE THIS BODY. OF THIS WEEK ACTUALLY THE. NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL'S. A I BELIEVE IT'S FIFTY SIX OF THEM CAME OUT AND SAID PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT ARBITRATION CLAUSES. ARE AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY THERE AGAINST TRANSPARENCY AND THEY ALLOW REPEAT PLAYERS ARE REPEAT HARASSERS TO EXIST AND TO CONTINUE WITH. THIS UNLAWFUL CONDUCT I HAVE PROVIDED THAT DOCUMENT FOR YOUR REVIEW WHICH AGAIN WAS SIGNED BY FIFTY SIX ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ACROSS THIS NATION. THE POLICIES THEMSELVES OTHER GOVERNMENTS BODY HAVE TO BE LOOKED AT. I AM ONE OF THE ISSUES WHICH I THINK IS A WONDERFUL STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT I THINK FALLS SHORT. IS THE ABILITY OF VICTIMS TO GO STRAIGHT TO WE. NOW IT'S WONDERFUL THAT THERE IS A A PLACE THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN GO AND TO DISCUSS THEIR EXPERIENCES AND PERHAPS GET HELP. PROBLEM LIES IS THAT IT'S NOT CONSIDERED PROTECTED ACTIVITY SO IF THIS BODY SAYS TO A PERSON WHO'S A VICTIM OF HARASSMENT OR RETALIATION. GO TO WE'VE. BUT DON'T TELL THEM THIS IS NOT CONSIDERED A PROTECTED ACTIVITY AND THE US YOU ARE NOT COVERED BY THE WHISTLEBLOWER LAWS IF YOU DO THAT. I THINK THAT'S A MAJOR PROBLEM. EITHER WE NEED TO SAY AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY IF YOU'RE TELLING PEOPLE TO GO TO WE'VE THAT IS CONSIDERED A PROTECTE ACTIVITY AND YOU'LL BE COVERED BY A WHISTLEBLOWER LAWS. AND OR YOU NEED TO TELL THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO COME FORWARD WITH HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION CLAIMS. IF YOU CHOOSE TO GO TO WE'VE THAT IS NOT. A PROTECTED US ACTIVITY AND YOU WILL NOT BE COVERED BY THE LAW THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS A VICTIM OR SURVIVOR OF HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION SHOULD AT LEAST KNOW WHERE THEY STAND. IF THEY'RE TOLD UNDER THE POLICIES TO REPORT SOMEPLACE AND WHERE THE REPORTING IS NOT CONSIDERED A PROTECTED ACTIVITY UNDER THE LAW. THAT'S A MAJOR PROBLEM. REGARDING INVESTIGATION. BUT I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL THAT THEIR INVESTIGATIONS THAT ARE STARTING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR TRANSPARENCY HOWEVER. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE INVESTIGATIONS WE NEED TO DETERMINE BOMB. CERTAIN GUIDELINES AND. TRANSPARENCY REGARDING THOSE INVESTIGATIONS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I THINK NEED TO BE ANSWERED AS IT RELATES TO THOSE INVESTIGATIONS ARE WHAT ARE THE RULES OF THE PERSONS IN THE INVESTIGATION. WATER THEIR QUALIFICATIONS AND EXPERIENCE DO THEY HAVE ANY CONFLICT OF INTEREST OR BIAS AYE E. DO THEY REPRESENT THE ASSEMBLY THE STATE OR ANY OF THE ACCUSED. THE LIKELIHOOD IS NONE OF THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE BUT THE PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN INVESTIGATIONS NEED TO KNOW THAT UP FRONT RATHER THAN AS THEY WAIT INTO THE INVESTIGATION ASKING THESE QUESTIONS ON AN AD HOC BASIS. WILL INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PERFORMING THESE INVESTIGATIONS BE PRECLUDED AT A FUTURE DATE FROM REPRESENTING THE SENATE THE ASSEMBLY OR ANY OF THE ACCUSED. FEES GO TO CONFLICTS OF INTEREST ISSUES OR PERCEPTION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST. EVEN IF THERE ISN'T A CURRENT CONFLICT OF INTEREST. IF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUBJECTED TO HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION IN THE WORKPLACE. OR ARE BY STANDARDS WOULD LIKE TO COME FORWARD REGARDING INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT. IF THEY FEEL THAT THERE ARE CONFLICTS OR IF THEY FEEL THAT THE. PERCEPTION IS THAT THE DECK IS STACKED THEN THEY'RE NOT GOING TO COME FORWARD CITIES ISSUES HAVE TO BE ADDRESSED AT THE FRONT END AND THEY HAVE TO BE. AFFIRMATIVELY COMMUNICATED. ARE THERE ANY POLICIES IN PLACE REGARDING. ANY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST WHICH MAY MANIFEST IN THE FUTURE DOES NEED TO BE CONTEMPLATED UP FRONT. ADDITIONALLY IS THERE ANY WAIVER OF ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND WORK PRODUCT WITH THE INVESTIGATIVE REPORT. IF YOU COVER INVESTIGATIVE REPORTS IF YOU HAVE ATTORNEYS DO THOSE AND THEN DECIDE THAT COVERED BY ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE AND WORK PRODUCT. THAT'S VERY PROBLEMATIC I THINK FOR THE ASSEMBLY M. AND FOR THE SENATE BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT THERE IS A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY. WE'RE ALSO ASKING EMPLOYEES TO COME FORWARD WHERE THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANT FEAR OF RETALIATION BUT NEVER PROVIDING THEM WITH ANY DATA OF WHAT HAPPENS. I'M. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WHICH NEED TO BE ANSWERED IS WHO GETS THE REPORTS AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM WHERE DOES THAT DATA GO WHERE'S IT DISTRIBUTED. IF YOUR WITNESS AFRAID ABOUT RETALIATION IN THE WORKPLACE AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE YOUR DATA IS GOING WHO'S GOING TO BE READING IT HOW IT'S GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTED. YOU'RE UNLIKELY TO COME FORWARD AND SHARE ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE AN OPEN AND STE WAY. ADDITIONALLY WHAT'S THE SCOPE IN THE MANDATE OF THE INVESTIGATION. IF THERE ARE OTHER IDENTIFIED PROBLEMS IN THE WORKPLACE LET'S SAY ONE PERSON COMES FORWARD WITH AS A REPORT OF INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE. THE INVESTIGATOR GOES AND TALKS TO OTHER WITNESSES AND FINDS OUT LOAN BEHOLD THIS IS A PATTERN OR PRACTICE IN THE WORKPLACE THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TOUCHED INAPPROPRIATELY. OTHER COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN A INAPPROPRIATE IN THE WORKPLACE. IS THE INVESTIGATOR ALLOWED TO LOOK AT THOSE ISSUES I WOULD POSIT THAT YES IF YOU ARE OPENING UP THAT INVESTIGATION YOU SHOULD ALLOW THE SCOPE OF THE INVESTIGATION DOING ENCOMPASS THOSE ISSUES. BECAUSE IT IS YOUR LEGAL DUTY TO ADDRESS. ALL ISSUES OF HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE AND TO UTILIZE ALL REMEDIAL MEASURES WHICH UNDER THE LAW IT IS AN EFFECTIVE INVESTIGATION. OF AN INVESTIGATION INVESTIGATOR IS PRESENTED WITH UNLAWFUL CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE. THIS BODY SHOULD ALLOW THE INVESTIGATION TO LOOK AT THAT AS OPPOSED TO PRETENDING THAT THERE'S BLINDERS AND IT NEVER HAPPENED THAT DEEP SIX IS THE INFORMATION AND ENCOURAGES UNLAWFUL CONDUCT FLOURISH. WHAT ABOUT ACCESS TO PRIOR AND SUBSEQUENT COMPLAINTS WHEN THERE'S ONE COMPLAINT? IT BIG COULD BE EVEN A MINOR COMPLAINT LET'S SAY ONE CAN BE CALLED A MINOR COMPLAINT BUT IF THERE SPEND THREE OR FOUR COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE SAME MEMBER THE SAME STAFFER. IT BEGINS TO LOOK LIKE A PATTERN AND PRACTICE PROBLEMS. AND SO THE ISSUE OF WHETHER THERE'S PRIOR COMPLAINTS OR SUBSEQUENT COMPLAINTS IS EXTREMELY RELEVANT IN ORDER TO GET A PICTURE OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING HERE. THE CONVERSE IS TRUE IF THERE WEREN'T ANY OTHER PER COMPLAINTS AND THE MEMBER HAS DEEMED TO BE. AYE ACTING APPROPRIATELY IN EVERY OTHER WAY AND IF THE COMPLAINT IS OF WHAT COULD BE CONSIDERED A STRAIGHT  <u><c.green>UP A</c></u> MINOR ISSUE. THAT ALSO SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BUT WE CAN'T EVALUATE THAT. UNLESS YOU NO ARE THERE PRIOR COMPLAINTS BY THEIR SUBSEQUENT COMPLAINTS AND WHAT WERE THE NATURE OF THOSE COMPLAINTS. THAT ALSO GOES TO RECORD KEEPING WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH RECORD KEEPING ARE YOU KEEPING THESE PUPPIES PARA COMPLAINTS. HOW ARE YOU ACCESSING THAT DATA WHO IS THAT DATA AVAILABLE FOR I WOULD POSIT AT THE VERY LEAST THAT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO INVESTIGATORS? IF I'M AN INVESTIGATOR GOING INTO FIND OUT IF A MEMBER ACTED APPROPRIATELY OR INAPPROPRIATELY IN THE WORKPLACE ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS I WANT TO KNOW IS. WERE THERE ANY PRIOR COMPLAINTS WHAT WHERE THE NATURE OF THOSE COMPLAINTS WHEN DEBATE HER HOW DID THEY RESOLVE. DID ANYTHING HAPPEN TO THAT MEMBER WHERE THEY DISCIPLINED IN ANY WAY OR WAS IT FOUND THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY NO INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT HAPPENED. THESE ARE CENTRAL QUESTIONS AND I THINK. OF THIS BODY NEEDS TO. DECIDE WHAT RECORD KEEPING AND THERE ARE CERTAIN CONFINES OF LAW THAT YOU MUST AT. AB ABIDE BY BUT SEPARATE AND APART FROM THAT. IN TERMS OF TRANSPARENCY AND ALSO FOR THE BEST PRACTICES THOSE OF PRIOR COMPLAINTS SHOULD BE KEPT SHOULD BE KEPT IN A MANNER THAT IS EASILY ACCESSIBLE IT'S VERY EASY TO BUT THAT IN A DATABASE I'VE SEEN THAT. OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT I'VE SEEN. WHAT'S THE STANDARD OF PROOF. WHEN ANY FACT FINDER IS LOOKING AT A SET OF FACTS YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S YOUR STANDARD OF PROOF IS ITS PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE IS THIS CLEARING CONVINCING EVIDENCE. BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT MATTERS. AND THAT HAS NOT BEEN ARTICULATED SO WE NEED TO DETERMINE WHAT OUR STANDARD OF PROOF SAYS. OFTEN INVESTIGATIONS WILL USE A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE WHICH IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BUT WHATEVER THE STANDARD OF PROOF YOU'RE GOING TO USE IT NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD ARTICULATED. AND SET FORTH BUT BEFORE YOU START THE INVESTIGATION BECAUSE OTHERWISE HOW DOES THE INVESTIGATOR NO IT HERE SHE IS SUPPOSED TO DO. AND HOW ARE WE SUPPOSED TO EVALUATE THAT EVIDENCE THE FITS. BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT WELL THAT'S A VERY DIFFERENT STANDARD AND I WOULD POSIT THAT WOULD BE AN INAPPROPRIATE STANDARD PARTICULARLY IN THIS CONTEXT AND WHERE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. ZERO TOLERANCE I WOULD SAY THAT WOULD BE AN ANTHEM A TO THAT. BUT BUT AS A BODY NEED TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION. ADDITIONALLY WE NEED TO LOOK AT OTHER POTENTIAL CONCERNS FOR BIAS REGARDING THE INVESTIGATORS IF YOU'RE HIRING PEOPLE WHO MAY BE OUT STANDING ATTORNEYS THEY MAY BE VERY FAIR BUT A STATE ALWAYS DEFINED EMPLOYERS. WHAT MESSAGE IS THAT SENDING UT TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO MIGHT BE COMPLIANCE THEY MAY BE LESS LIKELY? TO GIVE THANK YOU. INFORMATION IF THEY FEEL THAT. THIS IS AFFIRM WHO MAYBE OUTSTANDING. WHO ONLY REPRESENTS EMPLOYERS TO GIVE THE PERCEPTION OF BIAS IN THE PERCEPTION OF BIAS IS JUST AS IMPORTANT TO COMPLAIN AS ACTUAL BIAS? REGARDING THE POLICIES. WHILE I THINK THE POLICIES THAT ARE IN PLACE ARE GOOD START THERE ARE SOME CONFLICTS WITHIN THE POLICIES THEMSELVES. AS IT RELATES TO WHAT'S CONSIDERED A COMPLAINT TO REPORT. THOSE ART. IT APPEARS THAT THERE SOME CONFLICT. I THINK ANY ARTICULATION WHETHER YOU CALL IT A COMPLAINT A REPORT SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO REGARDING HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION THERE SHOULDN'T BE. I DIFFERENTIAL IN THE POLICIES REGARDING WHEN YOU INVESTIGATE WHEN YOU DOWN IF YOU RECEIVE INFORMATION THAT THERE'S. DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT RETALIATION IN THE WORKPLACE THAT SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO AN INVESTIGATION IT SHOULD NOT BE UP TO DISCUSSION. IT COULD BE. A SHORT INVESTIGATION NOTHING ACTUALLY HAPPENED IT COULD BE YOU FIND THAT YOU'RE JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE AND THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER VICTIMS BUT HAVING A DIFFERENTIAL IN YOUR OWN POLICIES REGARDING THE TERM. REPORTER COMPLAINT LEAVE SOME THINGS ON THE TABLE ARE THERE. OF WOMEN OR MEN COMING FORWARD INDICATING THAT THERE'S INAPPROPRIATE SEXUAL CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE THAT NEVER GETS LOOKED AT BECAUSE IT'S CONSIDERED A REPORT. VERSES A COMPLAINT THAT'S A MAJOR ISSUE. WHO DETERMINES AND HOW THEY DETERMINE WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IN WHETHER SOMETHING SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED I THINK THAT'S A HOLE IN YOUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT NEEDS TO BE? LOOKED AT AND CLEARLY ARTICULATED. ADDITIONALLY PERMITTING INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS AND RESOLUTION BY SUPERVISOR. THAT'S RIGHT WITH CONFLICT IF MY. IF I'M A WOMAN COMPLAINING ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT ABOUT MY SUPERVISOR MY SUPPOSED TO GO TELL MY SUPERVISOR AND MY SUPERVISOR. THEN GETS TO DETERMINE WHAT HAPPENS THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A SITUATION THAT WE CAN'T ALLOW TO STAND IN THAT'S NOT. A ZERO POLLOCK ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY IN IS CERTAINLY NOTHING THAT WOULD PASS THE SMELL TEST UNDER LOCK. AND AND I THINK THAT LEADS US BACK TO RECORD KEEPING I THINK IN ORDER TO HAVE. BUT WHICH WILL WRAP UP MY TIME. AND THESE ARE ISSUES THAT I THINK THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES NEED TO BE CLEARLY ARTICULATED THEY NEED TO BE ARTICULATED UP FRONT THE STANDARDS REGARDING INVESTIGATIONS NEED TO BE ARTICULATED UP FRONT. AND THERE NEEDS TO BE OF AN OPEN PLATFORM SO THAT WHEN INDIVIDUALS DO SEE SOMETHING THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE SAYING SOMETHING. AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS. YOU WERE GOING TO BE ASKING QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THIS PANEL AND THEN THE LAST PANELIST ON THIS PANEL IS MISS WEST. IN HERE UNDER MY CHAIRMAN FRIEDMAN VICE CHAIRMAN MITCHELL AND DISTINGUISHED COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. BY WAY BACKGROUND I AM AN EMPLOYMENT LAWYER AND I'VE SPENT THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS REPRESENTING. EMPLOYERS IN ALL ASPECTS OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES. PART OF MY PRACTICE FOCUSES ON EDUCATING AND TRAINING EMPLOYERS ON COMBATING BIAS AND PREVENTING HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE. I AM ALSO IN EMPLOYMENT MEDIATOR AND ASSIST PARTIES IN RESOLVING DISPUTES BOTH PRE AND POST. LITIGATION AND I AM A CONTRIBUTING EDITOR TO THE HARASSMENT CHAPTER IN THE WRITER GROUPS EMPLOYMENT LITIGATION TREATISE WHICH IS UTILIZED BY EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WAS PARTLY EVIDENT TO THE COMMITTEE I'M ALSO WOMAN'S. AND I AM ALSO AN EMPLOYEE. SO THE ISSUE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE PROBLEM OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE. A I HAVE NOT BEEN IMMUNE TO IN MY CAREER. BY AND IT IS MY GOAL WHEN I WORK WITH MY CLIENTS TO HELP THEM PREVENT HARASSMENT HAPPENING AND THEIR WORKPLACE. I WANNA START BY SAYING THAT I COMMEND AND SUPPORT ALL THE MANY WOMEN AND MEN WHO HAVE COME FORWARD. IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS AND TOLD THEIR STORIES IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES INCLUDING IN THIS LEGISLATURE. AND I'M ENCOURAGED THAT THE SPOTLIGHT THAT'S BEEN PLACED ON THE ISSUE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT WILL CONTINUE TO RESULT IN BODIES LIKE THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. TAKING MEANINGFUL STEPS TO TRY AND PROTECT EMPLOYEES FROM HARASSMENT. I WAS ASKED TO PRESENT TODAY ON CHALLENGES THAT EMPLOYERS. CONTINUE TO FACE IN TRYING THEIR BEST TO PREVENT HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE IN MY TIME ALLOTTED I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF CHALLENGES THEY FACE WITH RESPECT TO HAVING AN EFFECTIVE ANTI HARASSMENT PROGRAM IN PLACE AND THEN I'M GOING TO DISCUSS A FEW LEGAL. CAN YOU TO FACE WHEN HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS ARE IN FACT FILED. ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT CHALLENGES EMPLOYERS FACE IS REALLY GETTING TRUE BY AND FROM LEADERSHIP. THE EEOC TASK FORCE WHICH ISSUED ITS REPORT IN JUNE OF TWENTY. AT TWENTY SIXTEEN AND IS SUMMARIZED IN THE BACKGROUND PAPER THAT WAS PROVIDED TO YOU. MADE VERY CLEAR THAT LEADERSHIP IN EVERY ORGANIZATION INCLUDING THIS LEGISLATURE. MUST BE COMMITTED TO WORKPLACE FREE OF HARASSMENT. ABSENT THAT COMMITMENT IT'S VERY LIKELY ALMOST PROBABLE. ALMOST GUARANTEED THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS GOING TO CONTINUE. ALSO AN ORGANIZATION HAS TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO INSURE THAT THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN HARASSMENT ARE RESPONSIBLE IN A MEANINGFUL AND APPROPRIATE MANNER. MERELY EVAN POLICIES IN PLACE IN CONDUCTING TRAINING. WILL NOT BE ENOUGH IF IN THESE TWO CORE COMPONENTS ARE NOT EMBRACED BY THIS LEGISLATURE LEADERSHIP BY AND. AND ACCOUNTABILITY. LIP SERVICE ISN'T ENOUGH. ZERO TOLERANCE POLICIES THAT THE ASSEMBLY HAS IN PLACE AND THAT THE SENATE HAS IN PLACE. THEY NEED TO BE COMPLIED WITH BY EVERYBODY WHO WORKS IN THOSE TWO BODIES. NOW I AGREE A WITH MISTER JOHNSON'S COMMENT ON A CONCERN ABOUT ZERO TOLERANCE AND I ALSO AGREE WITH MY PANELISTS WENDY WITH RESPECT TO SOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT CAN BE MADE AND SOME OF THE POLICIES. AND I'D LIKE TO FINISH MY PRESENTATION THE MAYBE ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE. IF WE HAVE TIME. BUT LIP SERVICE IS NOT ENOUGH. LIKE OTHER WORKPLACES AND EMPLOYERS A LIKE OTHER WORKPLACES THIS LEGISLATURE. WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH POWER DYNAMICS AND THE ISSUE A VERY INFLUENTIAL AND HIGH VALUED EMPLOYEES. AND. THE LEGISLATURE HAS VERY HIGH POWERED INFLUENTIAL PEOPLE SOME OF WHOM MAY BELIEVE THAT THE RULES DON'T APPLY TO THEM. OR SOMEONE. WHO MAY BELIEVE GENUINELY ARE NOT? THAT THEIR CONDUCT IS SOMEHOW DIFFERENT THAN THE CONDUCT THAT'S BEING DESCRIBED IN A POLICY WERE BEING DISCUSSED IN A TRAINING SESSION. BUT THERE CAN BE NO EXCEPTIONS NONE. THESE INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF THEIR STATURE. MUST BE HELD TO THE SAME STANDARDS AND MUST BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR CONDUCT. IN ADDITION A POWER DYNAMIC SEXUAL HARASSMENT OFTEN INVOLVES BIASES. BOTH CONSCIOUS AND UNCONSCIOUS. IN STYRIA TYPES ABOUT THE ROLES OF MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR SOCIETY AND IN OUR WORKPLACE. AND I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT PART OF A RIGOROUS EFFECTIVE TRAINING PROGRAM TO PREVENT HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE MUST ADDRESS BIASES. NOT JUST RECOGNIZING THAT THEY EXIST BUT ACTUALLY EXPLORING TOOLS TO COMBAT THEM. THERE ARE MANY STUDIES OUT THERE THAT SHOW WE ALL HAVE UNCONSCIOUS BIASES EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US THERE'S A PRINCETON STUDY THAT SAID THE SECOND YOU SAW MY FACE YOU MADE A DECISION OF WHO I AM. AND THE SECOND I SAW YOU ALL YOUR FACES I DID THE SAME THING. WE OPERATE ON UNCONSCIOUS BIASES AND WERE NOT AWARE OF IT. DOESN'T MAKE US BAD BUT IT DOES MANDATE. THAT WE USE SELF REFLECTION TO DETERMINE IF SOME OF THOSE BIASES ARE NEGATIVE PREJUDICES THAT ARE MOTIVATING OUR ACTIONS AND CONDUCT IN RELATION TO OTHER PEOPLE. AND THERE ARE LOTS OF RESOURCES TO HELP THIS BODY DO THAT OCCUR WHEN INSTITUTE. THE. COOK ROSS A WOMAN OWN CONSULTING FIRM THAT SPECIALIZES IN THIS I BELIEVE IN YOUR PREVIOUS HEARING YOU HAD. A A SPEAKER WHO ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE THERE ARE LOTS OF RESOURCES. ANOTHER CHALLENGE FACED BY EMPLOYERS IS THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE TO BALANCE EMPLOYEE RIGHTS WHEN TAKING ACTION IN RESPONSE TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT. UNDER THE LAW WELL EMPLOYER HAS A DUTY TO TAKE ACTION THAT IS REASONABLY CALCULATED TO END SEXUAL HARASSMENT. IT MUST ALSO CONSIDER RIGHTS OF THE ACCUSED UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE DIRT DETERMINATION IS MADE THAT SEXUAL HARASSMENT OCCURRED. EMPLOYERS MAY FEEL AS IF THEY'RE CAUGHT IN A DOUBLE BIND WHEN DETERMINING WHAT STEPS TO TAKE WHAT EFFECTIVE DISCIPLINARY MEASURES TO IMPLEMENT TO STOP HARASSMENT. THERE IS CASE LAW THAT SAYS THE DISCIPLINARY A REMEDIAL ACTION THAT IS TAKEN CANNOT BE OR SHOULD NOT BE DISPROPORTIONATE WITH THE HARASSING CONDUCT. THERE'S ALSO ISSUES EMPLOYERS FACE WITH POTENTIAL LEGAL SUITS FROM THE ACCUSED. NOT JUST THE HARASSER I MEAN NOT JUST THE VICTIM OF HARASSMENT POTENTIALLY WRONGFUL TERMINATION CASES THEIR DEFAMATION CASES THAT ARE BEING. DEFENDED IN COURT AND THIS HAPPENS IF AN EMPLOYER FAILS TO HAVE FAIR OBJECTIVE INVESTIGATIONS TO GIVE ALL PARTIES AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE. OR IF AN EMPLOYER JUMPS TO QUICKLY TO MAKE DISCIPLINARY DECISIONS BASED ON FAULTY FINDINGS. THEREFORE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IN ANY ANTI HARASSMENT PROGRAM THAT AN INVESTIGATION BEEF PROMPT FAIR NEUTRAL AND OBJECTIVE. MIT COLLEAGUE WENDY IDENTIFIED IT IS VERY IMPORTANT UP FRONT TO DETERMINE IF THERE'S CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OR BIASES. TO HAVE THE RIGHT. ALL PARTIES IN THAT INVESTIGATION HAVE TO BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE. AND HEARD BEFORE ANY FINDING IS MADE AN ACTION IS TAKEN. FINALLY. EMPLOYERS CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH THEIR STRICT LIABILITY FOR SUPERVISOR HARASSMENT. IF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS COMMITTED BY A SUPERVISOR AN EMPLOYER IS STRICTLY LIABLE EVEN IF UPPER MANAGEMENT AND OWNERS OF AN ENTITY IN THIS CASE EVEN IF. THE. MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE HAD NO IDEA THAT A SUPERVISING EMPLOYEE HAD THE PROPENSITY TO ENGAGE IN THAT CONDUCT. WELL FEDERAL LAW MIGHT PROVIDE LIMITED DEFENSES UNDER TITLE SEVEN UNDER WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE LA A FAIR DEFENSE TO EMPLOYER LIABILITY WHEN A SUPERVISOR. IS BAD FOUND TO HAVE A RAST. THERE IS NO DEFENSE TO LIABILITY UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. NOW THERE MAY BE A POTENTIAL TO REDUCE DAMAGES UNDER WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE AVOIDABLE CONSEQUENCES DOCTRINE. BUT THERE IS NO DEFENSE TO LIABILITY FOR THE EMPLOYER. CONSEQUENTLY EMPLOYERS LIKE THIS LEGISLATURE ARE FACED WITH THE HARSH REALITY. BUT EVEN IF THEY HAVE A ROBUST ANTI HARASSMENT PROGRAM IN PLACE. WITH THESE COMPONENTS A COMPREHENSIVE POLICY TAILORED TO THE WORKPLACE EFFECTIVE TRAINING SECURE REPORTING MECHANISMS. FAIR AND IMPARTIAL INVESTIGATIONS APPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE DISCIPLINE AND REMEDIAL MEASURES AND PROTECTION AGAINST HARASSMENT. THEY STILL FACE. LIABILITY. IF A SUPERVISOR VIOLATES THAT ANTI HARASSMENT PROGRAM AND ENGAGES IN HARASSMENT. NOW I NO ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE THE LEGISLATURE MAY HAVE SOME RECOURSE IN RECOUP. YOU KNOW DEFENSE COSTS OR SOMETHING TO A MEMBER OR SENATOR WHO IF HERE SHE HAPPENS TO BE. THE HARASSER IN THAT SITUATION BUT THE FACT REMAINS LIABILITY. IS ATTACHED UNDER STRICT LIABILITY. WHAT'S THE ANSWER FOR THE LEGISLATURE. NOT SURE THERE IS A PERFECT ANSWER. EMPLOYERS ARE NOT SEEKING TO AVOID LIABILITY WHEN IT'S BEEN DETERMINED THAT THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING WRONG. INSTEAD WHAT THEY'RE WISHING TO SEEK. IS TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL DEFENSE WHEN IT'S DETERMINED THAT THEY DID THINGS RIGHT. BUT YET A ROGUE SUPERVISOR STILL ENGAGED IN HARASSMENT. MAYBE ONE OF THE ANSWERS. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW AS AN AMENDMENT TO THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT TO. COME UP WITH THE DEFENSE IN LINE WITH INCOMPARABLE TO THE HOURS FAIR DEFENSE. I BELIEVE THAT. IDEA IN YOUR CAPABLE HANDS. I WOULD LIKE TO JUST ADDRESS A FEW THINGS IN THE POLICY SOME OF WHICH AND. THE OTHER PANEL MEMBERS HAVE DISCUSSED THE ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY THAT IS EXPRESSED IN BOTH THE SENATE'S POLICY AGAINST HARASSMENT AND THE ASSEMBLIES. UP POLICY AGAINST HARASSMENT COULD RAISE SOME CONCERNS BECAUSE AS MS JOHNSON SAID IT DOES SEEM TO CONVEY THAT ANY. FORM OF HARASSMENT RESULTS ULTIMATELY IN TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT AND AS I INDICATED THERE IS CASE LAW THAT MAKES CLEAR THAT DISCIPLINARY ACTION SHOULD BE APPROPRIATE. BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF AN INVESTIGATION AND THE EXTENT AN EGREGIOUS NESS OF THE HARASSMENT THEREFORE IT MAY NOT BE APPROPRIATE MAY BE DISPROPORTIONATE AND THAT TO HAVE AN ABSOLUTE ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY. THE ASSEMBLY POLICY ALSO SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT. INVESTIGATIONS WILL BE DONE IF A COMPLAINT OF INAPPROPRIATE HARASSING CONDUCT IS MADE WITHIN ONE YEAR OF THE CONDUCT NIGH UNDERSTANDABLE I BELIEVE I UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE FOR THAT TIME LIMIT IT'S IN LINE WITH THE CURRENT ONE YEAR. PERIOD IN WHICH EMPLOYEES CAN REPORT TO THE DFV AGE HOWEVER I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. TO BE MINDFUL OF TWO THINGS. EMPLOYERS SHOULD NEVER DENY INVESTIGATING INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE NO MATTER WHEN IT'S BROUGHT FORWARD BECAUSE WE ALWAYS HAVE A CONTINUING DUTY TO MAKE SURE AND AS. MY PANELISTS WENDY POINTED OUT THERE MAY BE OTHER CONDUCT THAT'S GOING ON WITH RESPECT TO THE CO WORKERS OF THAT PERSON WHO COMES FORWARD AND IT'S OUR DUTY AS EMPLOYERS TO GET TO THE BOTTOM UP. BUT FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT THERE IS ALSO A DOCTRINE CALLED THE AVOIDABLE. THE CONTINUING VIOLATION DOCTRINE AND SO YOU MAY HAVE AN EMPLOYEE WHO COMES IN REPORT SOMETHING TO YOU THAT HAPPENED OVER YOU SOMETHING EGREGIOUS POTENTIALLY THAT HAPPENED OVER A YEAR AGO WHEN YOU THINK AND YOUR PA. SEE THEY DIDN'T REPORT IT TIMELY BUT IF OTHER MICRO INEQUITIES AND HARASSING INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT IS AND WITHIN THAT ONE YEAR PERIOD. THAT EGREGIOUS CONDUCT THAT WAS HAPPENING OVER YEAR AGO CAN BE BROUGHT IN. TO THE CURRENT. AND. EVALUATION OF WHETHER WE HAVE A HOSTILE WORK NVIRONMENT OR SOME OTHER HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE AND ACTIONABLE HARASSMENT. SO WE SHOULD NEVER PUT A TIME LIMIT THAT WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE PROMPT REPORTING SO THAT WE CAN FULFILL OUR DUTIES TO TAKE PROMPT ACTION AND INVESTIGATE BUT WE SHOULD NEVER PUT A TIME LIMIT. AND SAY THAT WE WILL ONLY INVESTIGATE IF YOU WERE IF YOU REPORTED WITHIN A YEAR. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT'S REYES AND MY. PANELIST WENDY ADDRESSED IT WITH RESPECT TO THE REPORTING IN RESOLUTION OF SOME COMPLAINTS BY A SUPERVISOR. SHE BROUGHT FORTH A VERY GOOD POINT THAT IF THE SUPERVISORS THERE ISN'T IT SUPERVISOR IS THE HARASSER THEN IT SURELY NOT. S. THE REPORTING POINT THAT AN EMPLOYEE HAS TO GO TO. BUT EVEN MORE SO. A SUPERVISOR SHOULD NEVER BE THE ONE TO INVESTIGATE OR RESOLVE ANY CLAIM OF HARASSMENT EVEN BETWEEN CO COURTS AND PEERS IF THAT SUPERVISOR HAS NOT BEEN TRAINED ON HOW TO DO THAT. THAT CAN ONLY EXPOSE THE EMPLOYER TO MORE LIABILITY IF THEY GET IT WRONG. THANK YOU VERY OUGHT AND MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S ALL I'M. REALLY. GREAT AND VERY COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION. I'M GOING TO OPEN THE PANEL UP NOW TO QUESTIONS AND WE HAVE OUR THIRD PANELIST AVAILABLE SO CALLED ALL START WITH A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THANK YOU THAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH MY OWN MIND. I'M HAS TO DO WITH. THE IDEA OF THE ZERO ZERO TOLERANCE AS YOU TALKED ABOUT AS BEING IN SOME WAYS PROBLEMATIC BUT ALSO WANTING TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND WE DON'T ALLOW WORK. PLACE ABUSES TO CONTINUE I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO SEE OUR LAST PANEL BUT WE HAD ARM PEOPLE FROM THE HUMAN RESOURCES WORLD COME IN AND WE ALSO HAD A PROFESSOR WHO SAID. ACTUAL HARASSMENT AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY ALL SAID PRETTY CONSISTENTLY WAS THAT YOU DO NEED TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY. BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU WANT TO GET TO A WORKPLACE WHERE. PEOPLE FEEL GOOD COMING TO WORK WHERE YOU HAVE MUTUAL RESPECT AND THAT THE MORE YOU FOCUS ON ACCOUNTABILITY AND PUNISHMENT. ON THE MORE TOXIC OF A WORKPLACE YOU CAN CREATE BECAUSE PEOPLE BECOME AFRAID THEY'RE AFRAID OF THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH EACH OTHER. AND IFEEL LIKE WE'RE GETTING TO A PLACE HERE IN THE CAPITAL QUITE HONESTLY WHERE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID THEY'RE AFRAID OF. OF OF WHETHER THEIR BEHAVIOR CROSSES THE LINE O MAKE MY QUESTION IS BOTH ABOUT WHERE IS THAT LINE AND HOW. START TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S CONSIDERED ACCEPTABLE AND WHAT'S OT BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE A MOVING TARGET RIGHT NOW. THAT'S NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO HOW DO WE BALANCE. HAVING A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE PENALTIES FOR ACTING INAPPROPRIATELY BUT ALSO WITH THEY'RE NOT AFRAID ABOUT ALL OF THEIR BEHAVIORS. WELL I I THINK TOLERANCE POLICIES DON'T MEAN THAT THE REMEDY IS ALWAYS EXPULSION AND I THINK FRANKLY. WHAT TO DO IN THIS PARTICULAR WORKPLACE BECAUSE YOU'RE ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT BECOMES EVEN MORE DIFFICULT RIGHT? THIS ISN'T A NORMAL WORKPLACE WHERE YOU HAVE YOU YOU COULD BE FIRED AND YOU'RE OUT TO TOUR SO I THINK. I'M. IN ANY WORKPLACE HOWEVER ZERO TOLERANCE DOES NOT MEAN NIGHT IT'S A PREDETERMINED REMEDY BY E. THERE COULD BE TRAINING THERE COULD BE. I'M SOMEWHAT LOWER FORM OF DISCIPLINE PART OF EXPULSION SO I THINK THOSE ARE TWO SEPARATE CONV CONV STRIKES ONE IS. THIS IS NOT THE KIND OF WORKPLACE WHO WANT TO HAVE WE'RE GONNA HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE. FOR HARASSING DISCRIMINATORY CONDUCT AND RETALIATORY CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE WHICH IS AT THE FAR SPECTRUM. OF EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS THE VAST MAJORITY OF DATING OUR ACTIONS ARE NOT HARASSING DISCRIMINATORY. OR RETALIATORY IN THE WORKPLACE I THINK BUT THE IDEA THAT THERE ARE SOME SORT OF OVER CORRECTION IS ACTUALLY NOT TRUE AT ALL WHAT THE CONDUCT THAT'S COME OUT IF THEY COME HERE AT THE CAPITOL I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THE ALLEGATION. OF COURSE HE SENT UP AND DETERMINED YET SO ALL OCCUPANT ALLEGATIONS ARE AGREE JUST CONDUCT THAN ANYONE COULD COULD DETERMINE THAT YOU DON'T DO THOSE THINGS IN THE WORKPLACE. THIS IS NOT THE THINGS THAT ARE COMING OUT ARE NOT. I AM I HAVE THAT. TAKING YOU TO LUNCH AND WERE HAVING A NICE CONVERSATION ABOUT. MY CHILDREN OR SOMETHING WE CAN COUNT ON THE COULD THE CONTACT THAT'S COMING OUT IS VASTLY DIFFERENT THAN NOT IN IS VERY STE SEXUAL IN NATURE. AND ARE EXPLICITLY RETALIATORY SO I THINK THAT LOOKING AT THE CONDUCT THAT'S ALLEGED. THIS ISN'T RUN OF THE MILL CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE. SO I WOULD BE WARY OF ANY SORT OF INTERNALIZATION OF AN OVER CORRECTION OR THAT. BEING OVERLY PC IN THE WORKPLACE I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT HAPPENING AT ALL I THINK WHAT YOU HAVE IS AT THE OPPOSITE SPECTRUM THAT YOU HAVE. THE HISTORIC. STARKLY YOU HAVE A WORKPLACE IT'S AFRAID TO COME FORWARD. AND SO WHAT YOU HAVE IS A BOTTLENECK. AND SO WOMEN AND MEN ARE COMING FORWARD WITH EGREGIOUS CONDUCT THAT HAS JUST FRANKLY NOT. BEEN BROUGHT TO THE FORE BECAUSE THERE WASN'T A SAFE SPACE FOR IT THAT WASN'T CLEAR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. AND THERE WAS CERTAINLY CONCERNS REGARDING BACKLASH I MEAN THERE'S A REASON WHY OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY WOMEN'S SIGNED. A LETTER SAYING THEY'VE BEEN SUBJECTED TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT OF AN AGREED JUST NATURE.* THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT AND THOSE AREN'T RUN OF THE MILL EMPLOYMENT. DISCUSSIONS. SO I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT. THE ZERO TOLERANCE DOES NOT MEAN. YOUR PRE JUDGING. WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO ABOUT IT? IF I YOU NEED TO TAKE THAT ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND I AGREE UNDER THE LOT DOES SAY. THAT YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE CONDUCT IS AS TO WHAT THE REMEDY OUGHT TO BE. THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE LINE I DON'T THINK THAT'S AN INCONSISTENT WITH. OTHER POLICIES ARE THE POLICIES ARE GOING WITH THIS BODY. YOUR QUESTION I THINK. IS FAIR AND I DON'T THINK IT'S UNIQUE TO THIS BODY ACTUALLY I WAS ATTENDING A LEGAL CONFERENCE IN SAN FRANCISCO LAST WEEK THE WOMEN LAWYERS TWENTY EIGHTEEN CONFERENCE AND THIS EXACT ISSUE CAME UP. WHERE THERE'S A SENSE OF WALKING ON EGGSHELLS AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT'S BEING DESCRIBED AND THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO OVERCOMPENSATE IN A RATIONAL WAY FOR EXAMPLE IN A LAW FIRM WHERE A? MALE PARTNER HAS A NUMBER OF ASSOCIATES ON HIS TEAM AND IF THE CASE REQUIRES THAT. THERE BE TRAVEL AT A TOWN HE IS NOT GOING TO INVITE THE FEMALE ASSOCIATE TO ACCOMPANY HIM BECAUSE HE'S JUST NOT EVEN GONNA PUT HIMSELF IN THAT SITUATION FOR FEAR OF SOME FALSE REPORT. UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S. AFFAIR REACTION I THINK ALL OF US NO WERE ALL ADULTS AS TO WHAT OUR CONDUCT AND NEEDS TO BE THE LAW REQUIRES THAT WE SELF CENSOR BEFORE WE SAY AND DO THINGS RIGHT OUR INTENT DOESN'T MATTER ARE THE IMPACT DOES. AND. I THINK. THIS OVER REACTION THIS FEAR THAT YOU DESCRIBED AND WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE DESCRIBING. WILL. FIND ITS WAY BACK. TO SOME SENSE OF NORMALCY AT SOME POINT BUT BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'RE HEARING. IN THE NEWS IN THE PRESS THESE DAYS THAT IS A REACTION BUN THERE'S NO LEGAL ANSWER TO THAT THE STANDARDS HAVE BEEN IN PLACE THE STANDARDS ARE GOING TO REMAIN THE SAME AND EVERYBODY HAS TO BE HELD THEM. IN THIS. BUT IF I MAY ADD. THIS IS SOMETHING WORTH THINKING ABOUT ALLIES. IT HERE AS YOU RECOGNIZE A MEDIA ATTENTION HAS BEEN FOCUSED A LOT ON THE MOST EGREGIOUS NOTABLY SEXUAL ASSAULT AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE TYPE RESPONSES TO THAT I THINK IS CUTE THE CONVERSATION. AND. YOU KNOW SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND VOTE INVOLVES A RANGE OF BEHAVIORS AND IT ALSO INVOLVESA RANGE OF. RESPONSES TO THOSE BEHAVIORS AND I THINK. WE ALL IS ADVOCATES HERE ON THE PANEL AND. AS LEGISLATIVE BODIES AYE THAT YOU CAN PLAY A ROLE IN TRYING TO NEW ONES THAT DISCUSSION A BIT MORE AND EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT WHAT HER ASMAN LOOKS LIKE CALL THAT'S MANY FORUMS. AND THE TYPE OF RESPONSES AND THAT THAT MY. THE APPROPRIATE EACH EACH CIRCUMSTANCE I THINK ASPECT OF TRAINS DR CRESSMAN TRAINS WILL. GO THROUGH THAT. AND AND LAY THAT OUT AND ARE ACTUALLY WE HAD A SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING HERE. YESTERDAY. APPROPRIATELY I MEAN TO YOU. GO TO WORK AND SUCCEED I'M AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO TO STOP AND THERE ARE. A WHOLE RANGE OF LEVELS OF RESPONSES TO THAT. SO I THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBLY TO NUANCE THAT DISCUSSION. AROUND SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND IT WILL HELP UP AS A BIT OF THE PANELISTS SAKE OF BRING THIS CONVERSATION. I'M BACK TO. A COMFORTABLE PLACE. Q. HOW DO YOU BALANCE THE. THE PUBLIC BENEFIT AND EXPECTATION OF TRANSPARENCY% AGAINST CONFIDENTIALITY. PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO AYE TALKING ABOUT. THUMB RELEASING DATE LEGAL STANDARD OF HOW THAT'S DONE OR HOW YOU JUDGE THAT. AND IN ADDITION ON HOW SHOULD WE. ALSO CONSIDER RELEASING INFORMATION ABOUT MEMBER TRANSGRESSIONS WHEN THERE IS THAT CONTINUUM OF OFFENSE SO. IS THE EXPECTATION THAT. WITH A MEMBER LET'S SAY. ARM OF THAT YOU WOULD RELEASE ANYTHING THAT VIOLATES OUR POLICY TO THE YOU KNOW TO THE PROCESS OF THE PUBLIC OR ONLY THOSE EGREGIOUS CASES I MEAN HOW WHAT WOULD HOW WOULD YOU ADVISE US AS WE CRY. IT'S POLICY. SELF. I THINK THIS IS A UNIQUE BODY THEN YOU'RE ALL ELECTED OFFICIALS. AND THE PERSON WHO YOU RESPOND TO IT. THAT'S NOT IN A PRIVATE CORPORATION SOME THERE ARE DIFFERENT. INTERESTS HERE MY ANSWER MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FOR PRIVATE CORPORATION AND IT WOULD BE FOR THIS A KILLER BODY WHERE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS FOR THE PEOPLE. AND THE ACTIONS THAT YOU TAKE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE UNDER THE SUNSHINE LAWS IN THE LIGHT OF DAY I ALSO THINK. WHERE YOU DO HAVE SUCH A GRAVE POWER DIFFERENTIAL THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT? AND ONE OF THE BEST THINGS. THAT WE'VE SEEN. TO ADDRESS THAT POWER DIFFERENTIAL. IS SUNSHINE LOOK AT THE ONE SEEN MANNER. YOU KNOW IT BECAUSE OF THAT GREAT POWER DIFFERENTIAL IN THAT PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IN FOR THAT PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL. THOSE ABUSES WERE ALLOWED TO GO ON FOR FAR LONGER THAN THEY EVER SHOULDN'T. THE SAME SORT OF CONSIDERATIONS MUST BE CONSIDERED HERE. PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO IF YOU FIND THAT THERE'S VIOLATIONS A POLICY OR PROCEDURE OF COURSE I DOUBT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ADDRESSING WITH THOSE VIOLATIONS OF LAW WITH YOUR INVESTIGATIONS. ALTHOUGH THAT'S SOMETHING YOU OUGHT TO CONSIDER ONE WAY OR THE OTHER WHETHER YOU DOING. BUT ASSUMING THAT THE WHAT THE CONSTRUCT IS IS ARE VIOLATIONS OF POLICIES OR PROCEDURES I THINK. DESCRIBING WHAT THOSE ARE I THINK. PUTTING THAT INFORMATION OUT ON THE PUBLIC IS NOT STUPID THEY CAN EVALUATE THESE THINGS IF IT WAS. THE CONVERSATION. ONE CONVERSATION ONE TIME WHICH WAS NOT LADEN WITH PROFANITY AND SEXUAL INNUENDO OR PUT PRO QUO VERY DIFFERENT THAN A SEXUAL ASSAULT. I THINK THE PUBLIC IS ABLE TO EVALUATE THAT IN BECAUSE THE RIGHT TO EVALUATE THAT. BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO ULTIMATELY DECIDE DO WE WANNA. HOW THAT NUMBER COME BACK ARE WE GONNA VOTE THEM BACK IN AND I THINK WE'RE SEEING THAT ON A NATIONAL SCALE AS WELL AS ON THE STATE'S SCALE? IS THE PEOPLE DO HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHICH IS A DIFFERENT THAN A PRIVATE CORPORATION. WHERE I WOULD ARGUE THERE SHOULD BE MORE TRANSPARENCY IN MORE RECORD KEEPING AND THAT THAT IS A MATTER PUBLIC POLICY THAT SPOT TO? OCCUR HOWEVER. THERE IS A BATTLE A GREATER BALANCING OF THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY. IN PERSONNEL RECORDS PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO. PRIVATE EMPLOYER AS OPPOSED TO THIS BODY. I DO THINK. CONCERNS ABOUT. INDIVIDUALS COMING FORWARD THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF FEAR ABOUT RETALIATION AND IT'S REAL. AND THE IDEA OF BLACKLISTING IS QUITE REAL. WHERE INDIVIDUALS FEEL THAT? IF THEY COME FORWARD THEY MIGHT NOT GET A JOB. IN THE CITY OR ARE IN THIS BUILDING. AND I THINK THAT ALSO HAS TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WITH THE CULTURE CHANGE IN THE POLICY PROCEDURE. AGAIN INVESTIGATORY CHANGES BECAUSE IF I'M CONSIDERING COMING FORWARD I NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO ME. AND WHERE MY DATA GOES SO IN ORDER TO ALLOW THAT INDIVIDUAL TO MAKE THAT. DECISION. ABOUT WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL TO COME FORWARD YOU WANT AN ATMOSPHERE WHERE THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE. PART OF FEELING COMFORTABLE AS IF THEY COME FORWARD THAT ACTUALLY SOMETHING HOW. THAT THEY'RE NOT MAKING A COMPLAINT AND THEN THERE'S NO ACTION THERE'S NO INVESTIGATION AND THEY HERE TWO YEARS LATER. THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO ANOTHER WOMAN OR ANOTHER MAN. SO PART OF THE CONSIDERATION IS NOT ONLY CONCERN OF THE IMMEDIATE DISCOMFORT OF THAT PERSON WHO IS A WITNESS. BUT ALSO IF THEY'RE COMING FORWARD THAT IS GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE NOBODY JUST LIKE IF YOU'RE BRING UP SAFETY ISSUES. WANNA MAKE SURE THAT'S FIXED SO THAT OTHER PEOPLE DON'T END UP BEEN THE SAME PROBLEM IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO SEXUALLY ASSAULTS AND. THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND YOU MAKE A COMPLAINT. YOUR EXPECTATION IS I MAKE THIS COMPLAINT THOUGH SEXUAL ASSAULTS STOP. SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT THIS BODY NEEDS TO CONSIDER AS IT BOUNCES ISSUES OF TRANSPARENCY VERSUS PRIVACY. I'M NOT SURE I HAVE MUCH MORE TO ADD EXCEPT I WOULD. YOU KNOW ENCOURAGE THE PROTECTION OF THE INTEGRITY OF INVESTIGATIONS AS THEY. ARE GOING ON I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT AN INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS HAVE INTEGRITY AND THAT. WE REMEMBER THAT THEY ARE ALLEGATIONS UNTIL THERE'S A DETERMINATION MADE THAT UP BASED ON THE APPROPRIATE A STANDARD OF PROOF. THAT IT DID OR DID NOT OCCUR AND IF THERE IS GOING TO BE DISCLOSURE IN PUBLICATION TO THE PUBLIC AS THIS BODY I AM. IS REQUIRED TO DO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE VERY CLEAR WHETHER OR NOT SOMETHING WAS SUBSTANTIATED OR UNSUBSTANTIATED AFTER A FAIR. INVESTIGATION. IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT ABOUT BEING ABLE TO PROTECT WITNESSES AND AND VICTIMS CONFIDANTE CONFIDENTIALITY VERSES SAW THAT. DESIRE FOR TRANSPARENCY DO YOU HAVE ANY. EXPERIENCE WITHOUT ERROR IS IS THAT SOMETHING THAT. HOW DO YOU TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT? I I THINK THIS IS A A KEY ISSUE. SOME INDIVIDUALS AYE AYE CURRENTLY REPRESENT INDIVIDUAL SOME WHO WISH TO COME FORWARD. AND ARE VERY HAPPY TO TALK TO THE PRESS OR TO TALK WHOEVER WOULD LIKE TO LISTEN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AND I HAVE OTHERS. WHO REALLY WOULD RATHER NOT? AND SO I AM BECAUSE THEY'RE AFRAID OF RETALIATION BECAUSE THEY'D LIKE TO NOT THINK ABOUT IT BECAUSE IT'S THEIR CHOICE. AND SO I THINK THAT IS IT A MAJOR ISSUE I DON'T THINK AT THE POINT. IN INDIVIDUAL MAKES UP A COMPLAINT. AND PROVIDES DOCUMENTATION THAT THAT IMMEDIATELY BAD BEFORE AN INVESTIGATION NEEDS TO. B. PUBLICIZED I THINK YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PROCESS FOR THAT. ULTIMATELY HOWEVER I THINK THERE HAS TO BE BY THE FINDINGS. AND WHETHER THIS BODY HAD THE CONSIDERS US SOME REDUCTIONS OF THAT PARTICULAR WITNESS NAMES ARE VICTIMS NAMES. THAT'S SOMETHING YOU'D HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH. BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS. REASONABLE POSITIONS ON BOTH SIDES BUT I THINK. PART OF WHY PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO HAVE THEIR NAME COME FORWARD IS BECAUSE OF THE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES. AND SO. WE HAVE TO EXAMINE THAT AND BASS IF THOSE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES TO THEM ARE HANDLED. WHERE THEY FEEL THAT? THEY'RE BEING HANDLED THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO TO. BUT. NOT BE AS CONCERNED IF THEIR NAME IS INCLUDED IN SOME SORT OF. BUT IF THEY FEEL THE REPORT GOES NOWHERE AND THAT CONDUCT CONTINUES THEN UNDERSTANDABLY THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A GREATER CONCERN. VALLEY ON. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY A. SO YOU HAVE A QUESTION PURSUE A IN THE CASES THAT YOU WORK ON ARE THEY ALL BASED OFF OF CALIFORNIA LAW AS IT STANDS TODAY. SO IN MY FIRM WE REPRESENT A INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FEDERAL WORKERS SO UNDER FEDERAL LAW. YOU HAVE TO BE. STATE WORKERS ABOUT BOTH IT'S BEEN STATE AGENCIES AS WELL AS COUNTIES POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND PRIVATE EMPLOYERS. SO. MUCH THE BODY OF MY. WHO MY REPRESENT COVERS ALL OF IT? SO WE DO LOOK AT COMPARATIVELY. ABOUT FEDERAL LAW VERSUS STATE LAW AND WE LOOK AT WHERE WOULD WE LIKE TO BRING CASES WHAT'S THE VENUE AND WHY. I THINK YOU MISUNDERSTOOD MY QUESTIONS MAYBE I DIDN'T ARTICULATED WELL NOT. SO BUN. A PREFACE IT WITH I JUST PASSED MY COLLEAGUE HERE MCCAULEY ACTUALLY ONE OF OUR STAFF AT IT A FEE. SO HE SIGNED A. A AT EASE OUT ILL EMPLOYEE FOR THIS STATE ASSEMBLY. WHEN HE WHEN HE TOOK HIS JOB. I'M AN EMPLOYER MYSELF. PRIVATELY OUTSIDE OF THE CAPITAL HERE. AND THERE'S ALL KINDS OF LAWS IN FACT WE HAVE TO POST THEM ON THE WALLS FOR. LABOR LAWS THAT WE HAVE THAT ARE. ST LOS. SO ARE IN THE CASES YOU TRY EVERY PERSON THAT YOU REPRESENT HOUSE THOSE LAWS IN THE BACK SO THAT WHEN YOU TO TALK ABOUT SUN SHINING OUT THE LAWS. SO AT THE AT THE CAPITOL YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORST JOB IN THE CAPITALIST HR PERSON IF YOU HAVE ALL THESE OUT WILL EMPLOYEES AND THEY HAVE NO LAWS THAT BACK HIM UP. I'M ASSUMING THAT DID SO WELL THAT THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT AS WELL AS TITLE SEVEN OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT APPLIES TO ALL EMPLOYERS INCLUDING THE CAPITAL REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU'RE AT WILL EMPLOYEE OR WHETHER. TWO SEPARATE ISSUES SO YOU AS A PRIVATE EMPLOYER ARE OBVIOUSLY COVERED BY THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT AS WELL AS TITLE SEVEN. AS IS THIS BODY. SO WHEN WE WORK SO I IS A QUESTION SO WE ARE WHEN WE'RE AT THE INTERSECTION WE WORK A FIFTEEN HOUR DAY WE SHOULD BE PLAN OUR EMPLOYEES. TIME IN HALF. WELL THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING QUESTION. THAT'S ABOUT UP UP. UP UP I WOULD SAY BEFORE SHE ANSWER SPECIFICALLY YOUR QUESTION. IS BUT I WOULD ASK THIS BODY. WHY DO YOU WANT TO PASS LAWS THAT YOU WON'T APPLY TO YOURSELVES WHAT WHAT MAKES THE LEGISLATURE SPECIAL THAT THEY SHOULD OWN IT? COVERAGE SHOULD WHY SHOULD THEY REQUIRE EMPLOYERS IN CALIFORNIA FOLLOW LAWS THAT THEY'RE UNWILLING TO FOLLOW THEMSELVES SO I JUST AS A PUBLIC POLICY QUESTION. YOU KNOW IN A WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS AS WELL AS OTHER AREAS ONE HAS TO ASK ONESELF IF YOU'RE PASSING THE LAWS BY WHEN YOU APPLY IT TO YOURSELF. YOU CAN ANSWER THE SPECIFIC WAIT AN HOUR QUESTIONS I WAS BEING A LITTLE FACETIOUS AIR THE OFF TOPIC THAT YOU DO. BROUGHT FORTH BUT YOU KNOW. AS A TRUE LAWYER RESPONSIVE DEPENDS WHETHER YOU HAVE TO PAY THE HER EMPLOYEE OVERTIME IN THAT SCENARIO. DEPENDING ON THEIR EXEMPT STATUS AND SO FORTH. SO THE QUESTION EARLIER I HEARD FROM. THE PERSON THAT WERE SCRAPING IN THIS IS THAT THIS IS ABOUT POWER. NOT NOT ABOUT TAXES WHAT I HEARD. AND SO IF YOU PUT A POSITION WHERE YOU HAVE THAT MORE POWER IN IN THE CASE OF. OF. MY COMPANY I HOME MY EMPLOYEES HAVE RIGHTS AND THEY KNOW THOSE RIGHTS AND WE HAVE TO DISPLAY THOSE RIGHTS TO THEM SO TEY HAVE SOME POWER. WHEN THINGS ARE NOT RIGHT. OKAY IF I DO SOMETHING TO THEM THAT'S NOT RIGHT LIKE NOT PAY THEM RIGHT NOT DO ALL THAT THERE'S A WHOLE HOST A LAWS THEY HAVE POWER TO RETALIATE BACK. SO THAT THEY'RE NOT INTO. IN A SITUATION WHERE I HAVE MY. TOO MUCH POWER OVER THEM THEY HAVE THEIR BRIGHTS. DO OUR EMPLOYEES IN THIS CAPITAL HAVE THOSE SAME RIGHTS I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE WE DON'T ABIDE BY SOME OF THE SAME RULES THAT I HAVE TO IN MY PRIVATE WORLD. AND THAT SETS UP A POWER STRUCTURE WHERE YOU. PUSHY TALKED ABOUT. THE CASE WHERE YOUBECAUSE YOU'RE OUT WILL YOU CAN BE. FIRED WITHOUT CAUSE BASICALLY EVEN IF THERE IS A THERE'S NO ABILITY TO COME BACK SO I GUESS THAT I'M TRYING TO. BUT I'M TRYING TO DO IS FIGURE OUT HOW WE GET OURSELVES IN A POSITION WHERE. BECAUSE WELL HOPEFULLY AFTER ALL THIS COMES OUT WE'RE GONNA PUT SOME POLICY IN PLACE THAT WILL HELP. THE PERSON WHO A DIP OR THE PEOPLE ARE IN THAT HR DEPARTMENT HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THAT WHERE WE GO FORWARD TO REPRESENT. BOTH THE EMPLOYER AND THE EMPLOYEE. UNLIKELY IN THIS AREA THAT THE LAWS ARE THE SAME MEETING UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT. THAT THIS BODY IS COVERED. SAME AS THEY ARE AT MY BUSINESS OR YOUR BUSINESS. AND SO THAT IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT YOU HAVE TO. A. TACKLED BECAUSE YOU'RE EXPRESS IT THAT LEGISLATORS EXPRESSLY COVERED BY THAT DIFFER EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT WHICH COVERS. HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION IN THE WORKPLACE THE AT WILL DOCTRINE DOES NOT OBVIATE THAT BECAUSE YOU CAN HIRE OR FIRE SOMEBODY FOR GOOD REASON OR NO REASON AT ALL AND SO LONG AS. IT'S NOT A DISCRIMINATORY REASON IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF A PROTECTED STATUS OR NOT BECAUSE OF A VIOLATION OF STATE OR FEDERAL. LAW OR POLICY REGULATION YOU CAN SAY SAKE I SAY THAT A LOT TO PEOPLE WHO CALL ME. SO. AS IT RELATES TO THIS ISSUE. OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION THIS BODY IS COVERED IN LIKELY YOU DON'T NEED TO ADDRESS THAT. BOMB AT THIS JUNCTURE. I ALSO WOULD HESITATE TWO ABOVE ARGUE THAT ELEVEN NO TWO POINT FIVE WHICH IS THE WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ACT. IS THAT THIS BODY IS NOT COVERED NOW THERE'S NO APPELLATE CASE WHICH SQUARELY ADDRESSES THAT BUT I THINK THIS BODY SHOULD. ACT AS THOUGH AND WAIT FOR THE APPELLATE COURTS TO MAKE THEIR WAY THERE'S GONNA BE I'M SURE A CASE AT SOME POINT WHICH SQUARELY ADDRESSES THAT AS A MATTER OF LAW. AND THAT THE CURRENT WHISTLEBLOWER LEGISLATION THAT WAS JUST PASSED SHOULD BE AUGMENTING ELEVEN A TWO POINT FIVE AS OPPOSED TO. IN PLACE OF ELEVEN NO TWO POINT FIVE SO I WOULD ARGUE THAT THIS BODY OUGHT TO CONSIDER ITSELF COVERED UNDER THE WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ACT. PERHAPS YOU MAY EVEN WISH TWO AND LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS CLARIFY YES IN FACT WE ARE AND THAT'S INDICATIVE OF PRIOR LAW. AND IT SIMPLY CLARIFYING YES. THERE IS NO APPELLATE CASE LAW THAT. SO. I THINK AS IT SPECIFICALLY RELATES TO WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE WHICH. ALSO IS ABOUT RETALIATION WHISTLEBLOWING. THAT THERE'S THE NEW LEGISLATION AND I WOULD ARGUE LEFT. FIVE OR EIGHTY COVERS SAID. BUT AGAIN WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE COURTS TO TO GIVE THE FINAL WORD ON THAT. I THINK TO TRULY BE HELPFUL IN THIS PROCESS BOMB AS WE GATHER INFORMATION AND DATA ABOUT HOW TO CREATE A SYSTEM. THAT IS FAIR AND YES IT WOULD BE NAIVE OF US TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE UNDER THE ASSUMPTION. THAT THE POWER DYNAMIC IS YOU KNOW ALMOST A ONE WAY STREET BETWEEN ELECTED OFFICIALS AND STAFF IT IS MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT. YOU'VE REFERENCED THE HUNDRED FIFTY WOMEN WHO SIGNED ONTO LETTERS MANY OF THEM WERE WOMEN FROM THIRD HOUSE WHO TALKED ABOUT THE DYNAMIC OF. THIRD HOUSE POWER BROKERS AND THEIR INFLUENCE ON THIS BUILDING. WE HAVE LEGISLATIVE COLLEAGUES WHO FEEL THAT SOME OF THE TENSION THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO THEM IS AS A RESULT OF. EXTERNAL. BROKERS WHO HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN THE OUTCOME OF POLICIES THAT THAT HAPPEN IN THIS BUILDING. INFLUENCING THE PROCESS AND SO TO SIMPLY ASSUME THAT IT'S LEGISLATORS AND STAFF. IT'S NOT IT NOT EVEN IF IN THE END AND WE CAN'T AFFORD THE FOCUS ON JUST THAT RELATIONSHIP. IT'S MORE BROUGHT ITS BROADER. WHICH MAKES THIS PROCESS. AND THE POLICIES WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND AND AND LAYERED. AND THE NOTION OF BIAS. COMES INTO PLAY AS WELL. GIVEN THAT COMPLEXITY. BOMB WHAT CONCERNS ME IS. THE TERMINOLOGY WE CONTINUE TO USE THAT CAN BE INTERPRETED BY. DIFFERENT PEOPLE SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS. AND SO PERCEPTION OF BIAS ZERO TOLERANCE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEMS TRANSPARENCY DUE PROCESS. FIGURING OUT HOW WE. DEVELOP A CULTURE. WE'LL WE CAN COULD CLEARLY DEFINE WHAT IS HARASSMENT. AND WHAT THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES WILL BE TO ADDRESS IT I THINK IS. I HAVE TO BE AT THE TOP OF OUR AGENDA AND SO EVERYONE HAS CLARITY ABOUT THE PROCESS OF HOW THEY CAN BE PROTECTED. MY COLLEAGUE ASKED ONE QUESTION TERMS OF BALANCE BUT I I'VE GOT ANOTHER BASED ON JUST. THE NEWS AT IT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE AND UNFOLD EVERYDAY AND THAT'S WHEN COMPLAINTS COME FORWARD. AND CHOOSE IT IS A CHOICE TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS. AND HOW WE'VE BEEN BEGAN TO. WELL IN THIS DESIRE TO HAVE A TRANSPARENT PROCESS HOW WE GUARANTEED DUE PROCESS FOR ALL THE PARTIES INVOLVED. WHEN. PEOPLE COME FORWARD AND WISH TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS. BAH I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT WE CAN HAVE A SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE AROUND PERCEPTIONS OF BY SIX CETERA. IF THAT IS. TO CONTINUE AND I'M REALLY CURIOUS ABOUT YOUR RESPONSE TO THAT. WELL I THINK YOU BROUGHT UP TO ISSUES. ONE IS IF THERE'S UP POLITICAL PAID BACK. WHICH I THINK IS PART OF WHAT YOU'RE RIGHT DURING TO RIGHT THAT SHOULD COME OUT NAY INVESTIGATORY PROCESS THEN CERTAINLY CONCERNED ABOUT BIASING CREDIBILITY. AND BIAS AND CREDIBILITY ARE SHOULD BE PART OF ANY. COMPETENT HE SAYS ESCRITORIO PROCESS KNOW THOSE ARE THINGS THAT IN ANY. INVESTIGATION WHETHER IT'S THIS BODY OR IN A PRIVATE CORPORATION WHETHER THERE'S ALL TEARY MOTIVES. AND CREDIBILITY CONCERNS ON ALL SIDES. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT VERY FAIRLY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ANY COMPETENT INVESTIGATION. SO REGARDING THE ISSUE OF ANONYMOUS REPORTING I THINK. THERE'S A REASON ARE SYNONYMOUS WITH. AND AND PART OF IT IS THE FEAR OF RETALIATION BUT OF COURSE ONCE YOU RECEIVE THAT. ANONYMOUS REPORT YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WITH IT. AND THERE HAS TO START TO BE AN INVESTIGATION. AND IT TURNS ON WHAT ENTRY POINT IT COULD BE LET'S JUST SAY HYPOTHETICALLY YOU RECEIVE A LETTER. THAT DISCLOSES CERTAIN CONDUCT BY MEMBERS. THEN AN INVESTIGATION HAS TO START AND USUALLY THERE'S ENOUGH INFORMATION TO START THAT INVESTIGATION TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. AND IN IN SHIRLEY CREDIBILITY AND BIAS CONCERNS SHOULD BE A PART OF THAT INVESTIGATION. IF IT'S ONE MEMBER AND IT SAYS THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING IN THE STAFF WHEN YOU KNOW THE STATUS IT DOESN'T TAKE ROCKET SCIENCE TO TALK. TO WHO'S IN THE STAFF WERE TO GO BACK WHO IS THE STAFF LAST YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE. WHO ARE THE PEOPLE THAT THEY HAD? WHERE DID THEY GO FOR VARIOUS EVENTS AND AND WHAT HAPPENED AT THOSE EVENTS AND I THINK? IT WOULD BE. I WOULD NOT WANT TESTS TO ASSUME SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU'RE ALLOWING AN AVENUE OF MORE INFORMATION TO COME INTO THIS BODY THROUGH ANONYMOUS REPORTING. THAT THERE'S ANY INDICATION THAT THAT MEANS THAT THIS BODY COULD NOT ADEQUATELY INVESTIGATE THOSE DOES NOT MY ASSUMPTION THAT'S NOT MY SOME SHIRT ALL.*. IF I CAN TOUCH UPON IT I ACTUALLY. WAS RETAINED AS A NEUTRAL INVESTIGATOR IN RESPONSE TO AN ANONYMOUS LETTER IN A RATHER LARGE STATEWIDE AGENCY A FEW YEARS BACK AND IT DOES. POSE SOME CHALLENGES THAT OTHER INVESTIGATIONS DON'T HAVE WHEN YOU KNOW WHO THE COMPLAINT INTO THIS. BUT AS WENDY INDICATES IT DOESN'T. IT DOESN'T A FOR GIVE THE EMPLOYER'S OBLIGATION TO INVESTIGATE AND REMEMBER. THE STANDARD UNDER THE LAW IS NOT THAT WE ABSOLUTELY GET EVERYTHING RIGHT. RIGHT WHEN WE INVESTIGATE WE HAVE THE CO TRAIN CASE IT'S BEEN ON THE BOOKS FOR MANY YEARS IN THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT CASE THAT SAYS EMPLOYERS HAVE TO ACT REASONABLY. IF TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHAT IN FACT HAPPENED AND IF SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE UNLAWFUL HAPPENED WE HAVE TO TAKE APPROPRIATE REMEDIAL ACTIONS TO STOP IT AND PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. AND SO ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS HAVE TO BE INVESTIGATED LIKE ANY OTHER COMPLAINT IT'S JUST YOU'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH MAYBE SOME DIFFERENT MEASURES TO DO IT. AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE REASONABLE. ONCE YOU MAKE A FINDING AND YOU'LL TAKE THE APPROPRIATE REMEDIAL STEPS BASED ON THOSE FINDINGS. I APPRECIATE THAT A LAST QUESTION MADAM CHAIR WITH REGARD TO RETALIATION IT IT OF COURSE IS OUR COLLECTIVE GOAL. I'M SORRY WERE YOU GOING TO SAY SOMETHING. THE IT THANK YOU YEAH I JUST WANT. WANTED TO ADD THAT. RECOGNIZING THE DIFFICULTY OF REPORTING AND AND THE POWER IMBALANCES THAT MAKE IT ESPECIALLY HARD WITHIN A LEGISLATURE. WE ARE EXCITED TO SEE MORE LEGISLATURE'S OWN AND CONGRESS CONSIDERING I'M CLIMATE SURVEY IS WHICH IS A WAY TO GET SORT OF. OR GENERALIZED INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON. AND PREVALENCE OF HARASSMENT THE EFFICACY OF THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AND. JUST RECOGNIZING THAT THERE WILL STILL BE PEOPLE WHO WON'T COME FORWARD HAVING SOME SORT OF WAY TO COLLECT THE INFORMATION. YOUR CLIMATE SURVEY IS IMPORTANT. AND I THINK DRESSES SOME OF THE ISSUES THERE. I AGREE AND AM HAPPY THAT THE LEGISLATURE. IS CONDUCTING ONE AS WE SPEAK OR AT LEAST BEGINNING THE PROCESS. I THINK WITH REGARD TO RETALIATES OF COURSE IT'S OUR COLLECTIVE GOAL TO TUNE TO CREATE A CULTURE AND A WORKPLACE WHERE. RETALIATION IS AN AT THE AT THE TOP OF ONE'S LISTEN TERMS OF FEAR ABOUT STEPPING UP OF PROTECTING THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL. RIGHTS I AM CURIOUS BASED ON YOUR COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCES IF YOU CAN POINT TO A CIRCUMSTANCE OR WORKPLACE. WHERE? WHERE A SYSTEM WAS PUT IN PLACE WERE RETALIATION WAS NEVER A QUESTION? AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE MY CONCERN IS WE HAVE THESE. ARE EXTREME EXPECTATIONS. AT AND I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT I'M OPEN TO BE CONVINCED OTHERWISE THAT A SYSTEM EXIST WHERE THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO OPPORTUNITY FOR RETALIATION. AND I DON'T WANT TO CREATE AN EXPECTATION THAT WE EVEN THERE'S A HIGHER STANDARD BECAUSE WE ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS AND WE SPENT AND AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC. BOTH IN TERMS OF OUR CONDUCT OUR BEHAVIOR AND PUBLIC RESOURCES USED. BUT THE PEACE AROUND RETALIATION AN EXPECTATION THAT I'M PROTECTED. PERIOD I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S REALLY REASONABLE REALISTIC. NOW I THINK THAT'S A FAIR CONCERN YEAH I'M UNFORTUNATELY STATISTICS SHOW THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION RETALIATION IT IS RETALIATION. MORE THEN THE OTHER FORMS OF A UNLAWFUL CONDUCT YOU COULD HAVE A SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINT. BASED ON ALLEGATIONS OF INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT THAT MAY NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF ILLEGAL OR ACTIONABLE HARASSMENT RETALIATES AND. THAT PERSON WAS RETALIATED AGAINST READ THE EEOC STATS EVERY YEAR READ THAT IF THE H. SETS EVERY YEAR MORE MONEY IS RECOVERED IN RETALIATION LAWSUITS THAT DISCRIMINATION AND HER. SO IT'S VERY FAIRS MAFIC WHEN I DO TRAINING WITH MY CLAIM TELL THEM THIS IS THE AREA OF LAW THAT YOU NEED TO PAY ATTENTION TO. AND THEN I TRIED TO GIVE THEM AN ANALOGY. OF GO BACK TO WHEN WE WERE IN. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND ON THE PLAYGROUND DAHLE AND TOMMY GOT INTO A FIGHT YOUR AND THE TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM BECOMING CRYING YOU DIDN'T WITNESS SAID. WHAT HAPPENS IN CASES LIKE THIS USUALLY HAVE A GROUP OF FELLOW EMPLOYEES OR FELLOW? SUPERVISORS WHO SUPPORT THE PERSON WHO'S MAKING THE COMPLAINT AND THEN YOU HAVE A GROUP WHO SUPPORTS THE ACCUSED AND WHAT'S WHERE WE HAVE. TROUBLE BECAUSE IF THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE VERY ROOTED IN THEIR DEFENSE OF ONE PERSON OF THE OTHER. AND THEY. ENGAGE AN ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION TOWARDS THE COMPLAIN ENTER ANY WITNESS WHO'S INOLVED IN AN INVESTIGATION WE ARE IN A RETALIATION SITUATION NOW. IS IT EVERY WORKPLACE INCIDENT ADVERSE AND GIVES RISE TO A RETALIATION CLAIM NO WE HAVE LEGAL STANDARDS AS WELL RIGHT IT HAS TO MATERIALLY AFFECT AND CHANGE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT. DETER PEOPLE FROM COMING FORTH IN BRINGING OTHER CIVIL RIGHTS CLAIM SO FOR. BUT THAT'S THE TRUE REALITY OF IT IF WE JUST LOOK AT IT FROM A HUMAN PERSON. RIGHT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO GROUPS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE ON TWO SIDES OF THE SITUATION. SO I AGREE WITH YOU AND. THERE'S PROBABLY NOT A PERFECT WORLD WHERE RETALIATION WILL NEVER BE AN ISSUE IT'S A VERY TOUGH PROBLEM AND ONE EMPLOYERS HAVE TO COMMITTED. TO PREVENTING. AND THEN WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND. IT THE AND CULTURE IN POLICY AND PRACTICE. THAT CAN MITIGATE THAT ON THE FRONT END. IF I'M THE FRIEND AND I AM A FIRM BELIEVER IN. BIAS TRAINING BEING A PART OF AN ANTI HARASSMENT PROGRAM I THINK A LOT OF. US ALL OF US AS I SAID BEFORE HAVE UNCONSCIOUS SPICES WE WALK THROUGH THE WORLD WITH PERCEPTIONS AND MISPERCEPTIONS. BASED ON WHAT WE VIEW OF PEOPLE NOT LIKE US LIKE GUYS AND SO FORTH AND SOMETIMES WE'RE NOT EVEN AWARE OF IT THAT WERE ACTING ON IT. AND SO I THINK ON THE FRONT END OF WE DO SOME PREVENTATIVE TRAINING IN THE ELIMINATION OF IMPLICIT IN AN UNCONSCIOUS BIAS WE MAY BE BECAME CAN BE A LITTLE BIT MORE AWARE WHEN AN ACTUAL SITUATION HAPPENS AT WORK AND NOT ACT ON IT. BEEN AGREE WITH YOU MORE. MR MARLA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. BUT I'VE BEEN TO A FEW OF THESE HEARINGS NOW. AND THAT THE MORE I LISTEN THE MORE I REALIZE. THIS IS SO MUCH MORE COMPLEX. THEM ERA YOU WOULD THINK ON THE SURPLUS SO I APPRECIATE THE TERM WALKING ON EGG SHELLS. SO FOR ME I WANT TO ADDRESS THE CREEPS. NOW WHEN I GET TO THE CORE IN TOKYO WHO THEY BEAT THE REAL ABUSERS AND. AND AND TAKE CARE BUT I I WAS PARTNER IN A CPA FIRM. I NEVER HAD AN INCIDENT. THAT I RECALL I WAS DID THE. HAD FOR A ONE OF A LARGE COUNTIES IN THE NATION SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT MY WORKFORCE WERE FEMALE. NEVER HAD AN INCIDENT FACT THE EEOC OFFICER WITH BECAME WE BECAME FRIENDS BUT I NEVER HAD TO DEAL WITH THEM. ON A PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIP BUT. SO IS AND I'VE BEEN A I'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF FROM SOMETIMES FROM PRINCE FOR BEING PURITANICAL AND. UPROOTED TIMES SO WE JUST KIND OF. SET A TONE AT THE TOP ALL THE TIME. BUT I'M. WHEN I WAS UP CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD IN TWENTY TWELVE. WE HAD A CREEP. SENATOR BATES AND I HAD TO DEAL WITH WITHOUT A MANAGER WHO. HE KNOWS JUST REMARKABLE WHAT HE WAS ABLE TO. PULL OFF OF HIM. INTEL MENTALITY IT CAME OUT. SO. I'M LOOKING FOR THE BALLOTS BECAUSE NOW I AM IN A CAREER WHERE I AM IN THE POLITICAL WORLD AND I KNOW THAT CANDIDATES CAN BE. DESTROYED BY WHISPERING CAMPAIGNS AND I HAVE HAD PLENTY OF. CAMPAIGN MATERIALS THAT SAID THINGS THAT WERE. ABSOLUTELY FALSE. IF IT WERE NOT TRUE AND AND I GET THAT YOU KNOW THEN YOU GO LIVE WITH THAT IN YOUR FAMILY GETS TO LIVE WITH THAT. AND AND AND SO I'M REALLY CONCERNED IN THE WHOLE BALANCE OF THIS TOPIC. OF FALSE ACCUSATIONS. BECAUSE WE CAN MANIPULATE AND I HAVE. WATCH CERTAIN THINGS HAPPEN I'M YOU KNOW I'M DONE WELL THIS IS THE OTHER SIDE OF. THE EQUATION SO I'M I'M REALLY CONCERNED. ABOUT. THAT BECAUSE AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL YOU WILL BE PAGE ONE. SENATOR ACCUSED OF. AND THEN YOU WILL BE INVESTIGATED. AND THEN YOU WILL BE FOUND THAT IT'S NOT TRUE. AND THEN YOU WILL FIND THAT THE NEWSPAPER ON PAGE C. TWENTY THREE. WILL SAY CHARGES DROPPED YOU KNOW SO YOU DON'T GET FRONT PAGE CHARGES PUTIN. YOU KNOW IT'S SO IT'S LIKE. HISSES. SO SO WRONG AND SO. I WANTED TRY AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS MALICIOUS INTENT. SO ARE THERE. BESIDES SUING FOR DEFAMATION. ARE THERE OTHER REMEDIES ARE THERE ARE THERE CRIMINAL. URGES IF YOU LIE AND YOU FALSELY ACCUSE SOMEONE ARE THERE. CRIMINAL REMAIN HE'S ADJUSTED. HIS EUROPE EUROPE NOW CREATED A DIFFERENT KIND OF VICTIM RIGHT SO NOW THE ACCUSED IS THE VICTIM WHEN THAT PERSON MAY HAVE. DONE NOTHING AT ALL BUT IT'S JUST PART OF ATTACK IS THAT UNLIKE THE. POLICIES ARE THE POLITICS YOU'RE A OF OF THAT PERSON. AND SO I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW WE BRING THE BALANCE IN HERE SO THAT. WE WOULD TAKE HER THE CREEPS. BUT WE DON'T HAVE ALL THESE SCARLET LETTERS. THAT BALL PEOPLE FOR THE REST THEIR LIVES WHEN THEY WERE INNOCENT. YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT CONCERN AND. UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK THERE IS A. HIGH PERCENTAGE OF TRULY MALICIOUS FRAUDULENT CLAIMS BEING FILED THAT'S NOT WHAT WE ARE HEARING IN THE NEWS I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE EXPERIENCING HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT IT'S NOT UNCOMMON TO HAVE THE ISOLATED. ILL MOTIVATED MALICIOUS FRAUDULENT CLAIM MADE FOR ALL TERRIER REASONS. AND. IT SHOULD NOT CHANGED THE APPROACH TO INVESTIGATING. THAT COMPLAINTS AND A GOOD INVESTIGATOR THROUGH CREDIBILITY ASSESSMENTS AND EVIDENCE GATHERING HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM AS TO WHETHER THERE'S REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT THIS IS A FRAGILE ESQUE FRAUDULENT CLAIM. THERE IS CASE LAW TO SUPPORT THAT IF THERE IS A DETERMINATION MADE THAT A HARASSMENT COMPLAINT IS MADE FRAUDULENTLY. WITH MALICE THAT APPROPRIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION UP TO AND INCLUDING TERMINATION CAMBY HAT SO FROM AN EMPLOYMENT PERSPECTIVE BUT I WOULDN'T CROSS THAT BRIDGE QUICKLY RIGHT I MEAN I WOULD REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A CREDIBLE. OBJECTIVE FINDING THAT THIS CLAIM WAS BROUGHT FRAUDULENTLY IS SO THOUGH THERE IS CASE LAW TO SUPPORT THAT THE EMPLOYER SAYS LOOK YOU YOU KNOW YOU'RE ATTY HERE RIGHT. THAT'S WHAT YOU CAN DO IS AN EMPLOYER. AS THE PERSON AS THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAD THOSE FALSE. ALLEGATIONS MADE AGAINST HIM HER YOUR REDRESS REALLY IS IN OUR LEGAL SYSTEM IT IS THROUGH THE CIVIL. CLAIMS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THERE ARE EMPLOYEE MEN ATTORNEYS WHO HAVE NOW STARTED TO MAKE THAT THEIR SPECIALTY ONE OF WHICH IS ACTUALLY IN OUR REGION HERE AND HE'S VERY GOOD AT IT. BUT IT IS A CIVIL REMEDY NOT A CRIMINAL REMEDY. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN AS IT RELATES TO. IT CONCERNS OF OF. ALLEGATIONS AS WELL AS ADDRESSING RETALIATION IS PROMPT INVESTIGATIONS. BY THE CASE RIGHT NOW IS JUST ARGUING IN FRONT OF THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEALS YESTERDAY BUT THE INVESTIGATION TOOK THREE POINT FIVE YEARS THREE POINT FIVE YEARS. ABOUT MY LAW DEGREE LISTA. THAT DAY TO INVESTIGATE A A SIMPLE AYE ISSUE IN THE WORKPLACE. AND SO THAT CUTS BOTH WAYS IT GIVES THE MESSAGE. WE DON'T CARE AND WE DON'T WANT YOUR COMPLAINTS BOB AND SO IF YOU'RE GONNA COMPLAIN IT'S GOING TO GO INTO A HOLE AND AND THERE'S GONNA BE NO REMEDIAL MEASURES. NOW IF ON THE FLIPSIDE. THAT THE PERSON FROM FROM WHOM THAT COMPLAINT WAS MADE ABOUT THEY HAVE AN OUTSTANDING COMPLAINT AGAINST THEM FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS. SO THAT OF COURSE IS ONE OF THE WORST I'VE SEEN. IN REPRESENTING PUBLIC EMPLOYEES FOR TWENTY YEARS YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE AN INVESTIGATION GO ON FOR THREE POINT FIVE YEARS. BUT. THAT ISN'T IT IS GOING ON AND I THINK HAVING A PROMPT INVESTIGATION. IS KEY TO ADDRESSING SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND REAL TIME. IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE THE KIND OF WORKPLACE THAT YOU WANT AND DISCOURAGE CONCERNS BOMB WHETHER THOSE CONCERNS ARE ARE VALIDATED BY STATISTICS ARE NOT. THE CONCERNS ABOUT US SOME SORT OF FALSE REPORTING WHICH AGAIN I THINK FALSE REPORTING AS INDICATED BY MY COLLEAGUE IS IS REALLY STATISTICALLY NOT AN ISSUE. BY PRETTY I DISLIKE THAT I GO LIVE ENTITLED FELLOW PANELISTS IN SAYING THAT I THINK ARE SHOULD FOCUS SHOULD BE ON. ACROSS THE SEA IS. PROM PROCESS CEASEFIRE FOR HANDLING CLAIMS. AND THAT BENEFITS BOTH THOSE ON BOTH PARTIES AND THAT SHOULD BE OUR FOCUS ON THAT. I THINK WE'RE GETTING A SITUATIONS WHERE IS MUCH MORE LIKELY THAT SOMEBODY WILL. REPORT DONE AND NOT HAVE THE CLAIMED TAKING SERIOUSLY. THAT IS THE REAL CONCERNED RIGHT NOW. AS OPPOSED TO THE FALSE ACCUSATIONS BUT. THAT BOTH CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IS A FAIR PROCESS BY INDEPENDENT NEUTRAL. ENTITY AT THAT REACTS PROBABLY IS BENEFITS EVERYBODY. THANKS BECAUSE OF RISK RESULT YOU'VE AT LEAST MENTIONED THE ISSUE OF. PRIOR COMPLAINTS YOU KNOW SO THAT IF YOU GOT ONE. BUT YOU GOT FOUR FIVE OR ONE SKINNER TOLD BACK YOU KNOW WE GOT MILLIONS. WITH ME THAT'S THE CREEPS THOUGH THE CRIPS I WANTED TAKE CARE OF OUR. OWN. WANT THEM OUT OF THE SYSTEM BUT I DON'T WANT I DON'T WANT IT. SOMEONE BEING THE VICTIM OF. A FALSE COMPLAINT SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND THE BALANCE I THANK YOU FOR COMING TODAY AND. ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THIS PIGGYBACK ON THAT FOR A SECOND. I SAID. I WAS A COUNCIL MEMBER ANNA A CITY BEFORE I CAME HERE AND I CERTAINLY SAW TIMES WHEN AND AND WE TAUGHT YOU TALKED EARLIER ABOUT SETTLEMENTS ABOUT HAVING. A PEOPLE THAT WERE Q. SOMETIMES PAY SETTLEMENTS BUT I HAD DEFINITELY SEEN TIMES WHEN IT WE CITIES. PAID CLAIMS AGAINST THE US SETTLEMENTS TO EMPLOYEES THAT THEY FELT. WHAT THEY MIGHT NOT BELIEVE THAT THEY THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN INCLINED TO? FIGHT THE CHARGER GO TO COURT BUT INSTEAD OF EVEN INVESTIGATING THINGS LIKE WORKPLACE HARASSMENT COMPLAINT THEY DECIDED TO SETTLE THESE ARE EMPLOYEES WHO HAD LEFT WHO ARE THEN GOING TO BRING. CIVIL LAWSUITS FORWARD AND DECIDED TO SETTLE JUST BECAUSE OF DOING A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND THINKING THAT IT WAS JUST LESS EXPENSIVE FOR THEM TO SETTLE. A CASE THEN TO TAKE IT TO COURT OR TO EVEN LAUNCH OF A FORMAL LONG INVESTIGATION. SO HOW DO YOU. NOW I UNDERSTAND SOME BECOMING FOR WITH THE WORKPLACE COMPLAINTS ARE FROM THEM CALLING A LAWSUIT. BUT DOES THAT IF IF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE EVERY SETTLEMENT PUBLIC. OR MAKE. MEMBERS OR EMPLOYEES PAY FOR SETTLEMENTS WOODEN THAT THEN SAY THAT YOU WOULD BASICALLY STOPPED DOING THOSE SORTS OF SETTLEMENTS WERE I KNOW WHAT YOU CALL THEM I'M NOT A LAWYER. WERE SORT OF EVERYONE THE THEY SAY THEY'RE NOT AT FAULT BUT THEY'RE GONNA PAY THE CLAIM AND YOU'RE SETTLING THE CASE RATHER THAN GOING TO COURT. AND HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE COURT SYSTEM AND THEN RESULTING IN A JUDGMENT HOW DOES. HOW DOES THAT IMPACT? THE DESIRE TO SETTLE VERSUS THE DESIRE DESIRE TO TAKE SOMETHING TO COURT. TO ADJUDICATED IF YOU'RE GOING TO THEN MAKE THE ACCUSED PAGE THAT SETTLEMENT OR MAKE THE RESULT OF A SETTLEMENT PUBLIC EVEN IF. THERE WAS NO INVESTIGATION FINDING SOMEONE TO FALL. WELL IF THIS BODY HAS A PARTICULAR. IS THAT THE RULES RELATING TO PUBLIC SETTLEMENTS ARE ARE DIFFERENT FOR STATE ENTITIES BECAUSE THIS TAXPAYER MONEY. SO THE TAXPAYER HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW WHERE THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT. I HAVE BEEN REPRESENTING PUBLICAN PLAYS FOR TWENTY YEARS AND. WHEN I AM PRESENTED WITH CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES. BUT AS IT RELATES TO THE STATE ENTITY MY RESPONSES THIS A STATE MONEY AND THAT IT TAXPAYER HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW WHERE THAT MONEY IS GOING. SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE THING I THINK THERE ARE SOME LIMITATIONS AS TO WHETHER YOU CAN HAVE. PRIVATE OUR CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES AND I AND I QUESTION ABOUT THE PUBLIC POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF ALLOWING SUCH POLICIES TO EXIST I THINK IT'S AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY AND I THINK IT ENCOURAGES. ADDITIONAL UNLAWFUL CONDUCT HAPPEN IF YOU HAVE SECRET SETTLEMENTS. AND GAG CLAUSES THAT'S WHAT ALLOWS THESE THINGS TO FLOURISH AS OPPOSED TO HAVING. PUB PUBLIC ABOUT THESE SORT OF BY A SETTLEMENT SENATE IN THE SECOND ISSUE BUT JUST. CLARIFY WASN'T IMPLYING THAT THE SETTLEMENTS ARE SECRET. I'M SAYING THAT. THEY'RE DONE WITH SORT OF A NO FAULT CLAUSE SO FROM TYPICALLY A CITY. CONSULT A WORKPLACE CLAIM WITH BY COMING TO AN AGREEMENT WITH AN EMPLOYEE YOU'RE AN EX EMPLOYEE TO PAY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY SAYING WE'RE NOT A FAULT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT WORD FALL BUT WE'RE GOING TO PAY THIS CLAIM BECAUSE IT'S. MORE EX IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY LESS MONEY FOR THE TAXPAYERS TO. PAY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THAN TO TAKE IT TO COURT AND WHO KNOWS WHAT'S GONNA END UP HAPPENING. SO I'M WONDER AND AND I'VE NEVER SEEN WITH A SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIM. ARM BUT I HAVE SEEN THAT DONE WITH WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION. CLAIMS BROUGHT TO DEFER MUNICIPALITIES IT'S NOT THAT I'M BECAUSE I MEAN YOU SAW THAT UNCOMMON. SO HOW WOULD THAT IMPACT THAN IF WE'RE GOING TO ASK THE. PERSON WHO IS ACCUSED TO PAY THAT CLAIM. BUT CURRENTLY UNDER THE LAWS. AB IN THE LEGISLATURE OR THAT FOR PUBLIC EMPLOYEES THE INDIVIDUALS INDEMNIFIED UNLESS THEY'VE ACTED OUTSIDE OF THE COURSE AND SCOPE OF THE PLANET. SO AS THE LAW EXISTS TODAY THE STATE DOES NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR EITHER THE DEFENSE OR THE COSTS IF THEY MAKE THE DETERMINATION. THAT THE INDIVIDUALS ACTING OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL SCOPING COURSE OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT. YOUNG PLAYERS DO INDEMNIFY AND THERE'S A STRATEGIC REASON FOR IT THEY WANT TO CONTROL. THE HARASSMENT OF THAT THE ALLEGED HARASSER DEFENDANT BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE THAT PERSON. GOING OUT ON THEIR OWN IN AND MAKING STATEMENTS IN THE LAWSUIT THEY COULD SAY I DID IT. ANOTHER'S LIABILITY FOR THE EMPLOYER SO. THAT IS A STRATEGIC DECISION THAT'S NOT A DECISION AS A MATTER OF LAW. THAT IT. THE TOOLS ARE ALREADY THERE THAT ESTATE EMPLOYER CAN DECIDE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO INDEMNIFY. AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DEFEND THAT ALREADY EXISTS IT'S JUST THAT. AS A STRATEGY DECISION THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO. ADDITIONALLY IT AS A MATTER OF LAW PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARE NOT PAID BY THE STATE YOU CANNOT OBTAIN PUNITIVE DAMAGES BY THE STATE'S TO EVEN IF YOU CHOOSE TO. INDEMNIFY. UP CORRECT SOMEONE WHO IS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN A HARASSER YOU DON'T PAY THE STATE DOESN'T PAY THOSE PUNITIVE DAMAGES THOSE WOULD HAVE TO COME OUT OF THE POCKET OF THE HARASSER. THINK IT IS. THERE. WELL WOULD MAKE SURE THAT I'M ADDRESSING. DIRECTLY YOUR QUESTION BECAUSE IT ALSO IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THE ACCUSED WHILE EMPLOYED IS AND IS SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION ARE ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER LABOR CODE TWENTY EIGHT OF TWO. UNTIL THERE IS A DETERMINATION MADE. THAT THE HARASSMENT DID IN FACT OCCUR BECAUSE THAT IS CONSIDER CONDUCT OUTSIDE THE COURSE AND SCOPE OF EMPLOYMENT AND THEREFORE THE EMPLOYER DOES NOT HAVE TO INDEMNIFY. AS FOR THE MOTIVATION FOR EMPLOYERS ENSURING INTO PRIVATE SETTLEMENTS IN LIEU OF PROTRACTED LITIGATION. A THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT MOTIVATIONS FOR THAT ONE OF WHICH COULD BE THE PURE COST AND TIME INVOLVED IN. A LITIGATION OUR COURTS ARE VERY IMPACTED THESE CASES GO ON FOR YEARS AND IF IN FACT YOU DO END UP. ALWAYS. SURE. THAT JURY IS GOING TO BE AND WHAT THE RISK AS A OTHER MOTIVATIONS ARE. WE IN FACT NEED TO RESOLVE THIS BECAUSE THIS IS BAD. RIGHT THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED WE DON'T HAVE. LEGITIMATE DEFENSES TAKING THIS TO TRIAL SO WE SHOULD GET IT RESOLVED TO THEIR MANY DIFFERENT REASONS. BUT OFTEN TIMES. I BELIEVE AND WHAT YOU WERE REFERRING TO. AND CHAIRWOMAN WAS JUST THE DECISION TO HAVE A SETTLEMENT WITH THE NON ADMISSION BECAUSE TO GET THIS PUT BEHIND US AND SO IF WE ENTER INTO THESE BUT YET WE TURN AROUND. AND WE. PUBLICIZING MAHLER DISCLOSE THEM BECAUSE WERE A PUBLIC BODY TO THE. TO THE PUBLIC HOW DOES THAT. BECAUSE THAT HELP IN ANYWAY VERSE IS JUST GOING TO TRIAL AND IT BEING PUBLIC AND I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO DETERMINE. WHAT ARE THE REASONS WHY AN EARLY SETTLEMENT IS BETTER THAN A PROTRACTED LITIGATION TO? PASSED FOR PATIENTS FOR MY COLLEAGUES WHO I KNOW HAVE QUESTIONS AND ASK THE PANEL IF YOU CAN STAY FOR A FEW MORE MINUTES BUT WE DO HAVE A PANELIST TO HUSTLE LEAVE BECAUSE SHE'S CATCHING AIRPLANES HOPE YOU DON'T MIND I'M GONNA CALL UP AND REBEL. TO. MAKE HER COMMENTS AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT WE CAN I ASK YOU TO COME BACK UP IF THAT'S OKAY. AND I WILL ASK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR UNDERSTANDING. WILL COME. THIS RATTLED. WELL LET MISS WEST. GO OVER SO THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO I'M SORRY NOT MISS WEST MR JOHNSON LEAVE SO THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO SAY STARING AT A SCREEN. BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HELP SAY WAS VERY HELPFUL EACH YEAR THEY GIVE US OPPORTUNITIES. MADAM CHAIR I'M I'M ACTUALLY I HAVE A CLASS TO TEACH AND. THANK YOU FOR TAKING ME A LITTLE BIT OUT OF OUT OF ORDER A MY NAME IS ANN RAVEL AND I'M THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION AS WELL AS THE. OF FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION. AND. FIRE HERE BUT NOT TO SPEAK ABOUT. SEXUAL HARASSMENT PER SE BUT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. OF RELATING TO THE ENFORCEMENT OF MATTERS AGAINST PUBLIC OFFICIALS AND. I. FRANKLY BELIEVE. THAT. AND I HAVE DONE SEXUAL HARASSMENT WORK WHEN I WAS A LAWYER FOR THE COUNTY. BUT I DO THINK THAT. THE LEGISLATURE IS UNIQUE. AND THAT HOW TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. IS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN. AS A REGULAR EMPLOYEE. AND FOR THE REASONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. MANY OF THEM BECAUSE. OBVIOUSLY THE. DESIRE. TO PROTECT THE VICTIM OR THE ALLEGED VICTIM. UP AND TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS A PAPER FAIR PROCESS IS THE SAME. NO MATTER WHAT. BUT. THERE IS UNIQUE. ASPECTS. OF. INDIVIDUALS WHO IN A POLITICAL POSITION. AND HOW AND. PRESS AND OTHER AND INFORMATION THAT COMES OUT IS BEING USED. AGAINST THEM. AND FOR THAT REASON I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT. AND THIS IS I THINK WHY I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK. I THINK YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT MIGHT BE. A BETTER PROCESS. RATHER THAN A REGULAR. EMPLOYERS WHO MIGHT HAVE AN INTERNAL PROCESS. SO I AND EXCUSE ME IF YOU. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS TO LOOK AT AT THESE COMPLAINTS. BOTTOM. ONE OF THEM IS JUST HIRE AN INVESTIGATOR A LAWYER WHICH I THINK. PEOPLE HAVE REFERRED TO TODAY I'M WHICH I DO NOT THINK IS PROBABLY THE BEST. WAY UP AND THERE'S ALSO. A HIDDEN SOMEBODY'S. HAVE A SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL LIKE AND I. AYE G.. WHO WOULD BE THE PERSON? TO OVERSEE AN INVESTIGATOR OR DO THE INVESTIGATION THEMSELVES. IN A SEPARATE BODY I'M SORRY AND INSPECTOR GENERAL. AND. SOME COMMISSIONS LIKE THE F. PPC. OF ACTUALLY IN OTHER STATES ACTUALLY ONLY HAVE ONE COMMISSIONER. AND DIDN'T BESSIE GATORS. BUT. FRANKLY HAVING SEEN BOTH THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION AND THE CALIFORNIA FAIR POLITICAL PRACTICES COMMISSION. MY VIEW IS THAT THAT IS. A REALLY GOOD MECHANISM. FOR REVIEWING COMPLAINTS AGAINST ELECTED OFFICIALS WHETHER IT BE. FOR OTHER. VIOLATIONS OF THE POLITICAL REFORM ACT IS THAT IS. OR. ETHICS VIOLATIONS WHICH THE FPC ALSO HAS AUTHORITY OVER. OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS I'M AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS. IF YOU LOOK AT IT. THE COMPANY COMPOSITION OF THE F. PPC. IT IS SPECIFICALLY BIPARTISAN. AND IT IS INTENDED TO BE NONPARTISAN. AND YOU KNOW I. THIS IS NOT WASHINGTON DC I UNDERSTAND THAT HAPPY TO BE BACK IN CALIFORNIA WHERE IT IS NOT. BUT. BURDEN. NONE THE LESS THERE ARE POLITICAL ASPECTS. TO THESE ISSUES NO QUESTION ABOUT IT. SO HAVING A BIPARTISAN COMMISSION. IS A REALLY. GOOD ALTERNATIVE. TO HAVING ONE PERSON WHO MAY BE APPOINTED BY SOMEBODY. OF ONE PARTY OR ANOTHER. I'M. IT THE. SUDDEN OTHER. ASPECT OF IT IS THAT BECAUSE THOSE COMMISSIONS ARE TOTALLY INDEPENDENT. AND ACT IN DEPENDENTLY DO NOT REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE PER SE EXCEPT. INSOFAR AS THEY HAVE RELATIONSHIPS AND THEY SHOULD. TO DO TRAINING TO TO. TRY TO CHANGE THE CULTURE AS YOU SPOKE ABOUT. A AND TO GET COMPLIANCE AHEAD OF TIME RATHER THAN FOCUSING SOLELY ON. PUNISHMENT AND WELL OF COURSE THERE'S THAT THAT WHOLE TIMIDLY HAS TO TAKE PLACE IS WELL WE ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW. BUT. REALLY WITH THOSE KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS. TENDS TO SEE THEIR ROLE. IN MANY WAYS AS. TRYING TO WORK WITH THE BODY THAT THEY ARE THERE TO OVERSEE IN THE SENSE. TO GET. VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE TO CHANGE THE CULTURE SO THAT IT'S NOT. PURELY PUNITIVE BUT IT IS UP. EDUCATION. AND ABOUT HOW TO HOW THEY INTERACT. PURSUANT TO THE LAW. SO THIS IS WHY. IN SOME WAYS I THINK. THAT MODEL IS A GOOD ONE AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW I MEAN. AND THEY'RE PROBABLY LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS OF SETTING IT UP. ON LEGISLATIVELY IF YOU WERE GOING TO. PURSUE SOMETHING LIKE THIS BUT THE F. PPC THE APPOINTMENTS. ARE. EACH CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICER. HAS IT BEEN APPOINTMENT. UP AND AND IF THERE ARE AS IN THE CASE OF CALIFORNIA. ONLY ONE PARTY S. CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS THEN SOME OF THE APPOINTMENTS MUST BE MADE UP AND IN THIS CASE UP BY THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. UP AND AND THAT. PROVIDES THAT BALANCE AND THAT SORT OF CHECK. ON THE AUTHORITY OF THE COMMISSION. WHICH THEN. OVERSEAS BE INVESTIGATORS WITHIN THE WITHIN THE AGENCY. OF. SO BAD INDEPENDENCE I THINK IS. A REALLY GOOD THING BECAUSE WHAT IT DOES IS IT. REQUIRES UNLIKE THE A FDC. WHERE IT WAS A BODY OF SIX? AND A THE ESSENTIAL APPOINTEES WERE EITHER THE MAJORITY LEADER OR THE. MINORITY LEADER OF THE SENATE. AND. AS A RESULT THERE WAS. SOME SENATE'S. ABED. THEY WERE BEHOLDEN TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS SO THEY ESSENTIALLY BECAME MUCH MORE POLITICAL AND I THINK YOU. RENDON VIEW. MY REPORT THAT I WROTE BEFORE WHEN I LEFT THE FEC AND IT. CERTAINLY HAD AN IMPACT IN ENFORCEMENT. AT THE FTC. BUT. BE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT BY THE PREVIOUS PANEL. ARE ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE CLEARLY. THE ABILITY OF SUCH AN INDEPENDENT COMMISSION TO ACT. IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE FACT THAT THEY ARE PROVIDED AMPLE BUDGET. TO DO SO. UN AND HEAD. AND. IN MANY. COMMISSIONS NATIONWIDE UP AND HOW THE. LEGISLATURE OVER OR LOCAL. GOVERNMENT UP MANAGES TO ASSURE THAT THERE IS NO ACTUAL. ITEM FAIR ACTIVITY OF THOSE COMMISSIONS IS THAT THEY ARE STARVED FOR RESOURCES. SO RESOURCES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR BOTH ASPECTS BOTH FOR THE EDUCATION. THE ADVICE ASPECT WHICH SHOULD BE A COMPONENT OF IT. BUT ALSO FOR THE ENFORCEMENT AND INVESTIGATION ASPECT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT THERE BE SUFFICIENT. OF RESOURCES. SO A. THE OTHER THE OTHER THING IS I'M AS IS TRUE OF THE PPC. THE THE COMMISSIONERS CAN'T BE REMOVED DURING THEIR TERMS. SO IT THERE CAN'T BE ANY RETALIATION OR ANY ANY. ACTIONS IF PEOPLE DO NOT AGREE WITH THEIR WITH THEIR ACTIONS WITH REGARD TO THE INVESTIGATIONS AND I THAT DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. TO HAVE INVESTIGATORS THAT BEEN. OF MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE COMMISSIONERS. A AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THEY HAVE TO BE TIME TIMELY I SPIT THINK THAT'S BEEN SAID BEFORE. BUT THAT IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT NO MATTER WHAT. THE CONTEXT. BUT IN PARTICULAR IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT MATTERS IT THEY. MUST BE TIMELY AND I WOULD SUGGEST. BUT ANY RULES RELATING TO SUCH A COMMISSION WOULD HAVE TARGETS. FOR FOR TIMELINES NOT NECESSARILY. REQUIRING THEM BECAUSE SOME THINGS ARE MORE COMPLEX THAN OTHERS. BUT TIME OF TARGETS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT BOTH FOR THE VICTIMS AS WELL AS THE CUES. AND I ALSO THINK THAT THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS ITSELF AND I MAY DIFFER FOR THEM. WHAT SOME OF THE OTHERS ON THE? PANEL. PRIOR TO. HAVE SAID OF. I BELIEVE THAT THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS SHOULD BE. TOTALLY CONFIDENTIAL. AND I. DO NOT THINK THAT UNLESS THERE IS. OF FINDING THAT THERE IS A. VALID. BELIEF OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT OCCURRED. THAT THERE SHOULD BE PUBLICITY SURROUNDING AND I THINK THAT IT IS. SO IMPORTANT AND I SAW THIS AT THE AT PPC. JUST BE ALLEGATION. JUST THIS STATEMENT JUST A COMPLAINT BEING FILED AND YOU CAN'T STOP PEOPLE FROM. PUBLICIZING THEIR OWN COMPLAINTS. BUT JUST THAT COMPLAINT. IS ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO. HAVE BEEN ADVERSE VIEW. OF THE PERSON WHO IS BEING COMPLAINED AGAINST AND THAT IT I THINK. YOU SAID OF WE KNOW THAT'S ON THE FRONT PAGE. BUT THE SACRAMENTO BEE OR WHATEVER HOMETOWN NEWSPAPER. AND THEN THE DECISION. WHERE NOTHING IN NOTHING IS PROVEN? IT IS USUALLY HIDDEN SOMEWHERE IN ONE PARAGRAPH OR MAYBE NOT AT ALL. AND SO I I DO HAVE CONCERNS. ABOUT HAVING PUBLICITY AND I AM A. BIG BELIEVER IN GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY WITHOUT A DOUBT BUT. SOMETIMES THESE CASES. CAN HAVE. CONSEQUENCES THE BETTER REALLY UNFAIR AND I THINK THAT THE PROCESS. BUT IT LET ME JUST SAY AND I THINK I MENTIONED THIS. TEARS STAFF. WHEN A LISTING ON THE WEBSITE. OF ALL THE COMPLAINTS THAT HAD BEEN FILED AND SO IT RAISE THE. A. IT RAISES THE NOTORIETY OF IT. WHICH. I DO NOT THINK THAT AN INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY. SHOULD ENGAGE AND BE INVESTIGATIVE AGENCY MUST ENSURE THAT THE PROCESS IS FAIR TO THE VICTIM. ALLEGED VICTIM TO THE. ALLEGED PERPETRATOR. AND ONCE A DETERMINATION IS MADE. THEN. PUBLICITY IS FINE NOT A PROBLEM. BUT PRIOR TO THAT TIME I I DO NOT THINK THAT IT'S APPROPRIATE. SO. I I ALSO THINK I MEAN. I UNDERSTAND WHY ACCUSERS LIKE THERE WAS A QUESTION ABOUT ANONYMOUS ACCUSERS. I UNDERSTAND WHY THERE WOULD BE ANONYMITY. UP NO QUESTION AND BE THERE HAS TO BE PROTECTION FOR THE ACCUSERS AS WELL AND SO. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THERE BE SOME KIND OF A FLEXIBLE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS. SO THAT THE ROOM RIGHTS IN THE PRIVACY OF THE ACCUSERS. ATTACKED. BUT. WITH COGNIZANT OF THEM UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE RIGHTS AND PRIVACY NEEDS OF THE. DEFENSE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING ACCUSED AS WELL. SO WITH THAT I DON'T WANT TO TAKE TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME BUT I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER SINCE. I'M THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. AT YOU KNOW WERE. ARE STARTING TO IS GOOD THE PANEL IS MOVE IS STARTING TO MOVE FROM IDENTIFYING PROBLEM. LOOKING AT ISSUES AND ALSO INTO POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS SO ARMED THIS IS A YOU KNOW A VERY INTERESTING AREA AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SUGGESTION AND A LOT OF FOUGHT AMONGST US. ABOUT BREEN OUTSIDE ENTITY OF SOME SORT IN OR CREATING ONE AND HOUSE AND HOW YOU BALANCE. THE GOVERNANCE OF THIS BODY HAVING BEEN FROM WITHIN. THE LEGISLATURE. TO LOOKING AT THESE OUTSIDE NOT JUST INVESTIGATORS OR ADVISORS BUT THE F. PPC ACTION IS ALSO AN ENFORCER. AND WHEN IT COMES TO CAMPAIGN FINANCE AND IT COMES TO CERTAIN TYPES OF ETHICS VIOLATIONS. WE DON'T POLICE OURSELVES WE SEEM TO HAVE AN OUTSIDE BODY THAT DOES THAT WHICH HAS SOME CHALLENGES BUT ALSO. A IS THEM OUT IN MY MIND A MUCH FAIRER. WAY FOR EVERYBODY OF HAVING THAT DONE. BECAUSE. PEOPLE HAVE SAID WELL THE LATEST LEGISLATURE'S INCAPABLE OF POLICING ITSELF BUT I WOULD ALSO SUBMIT THAT IT'S ON FAIR. TO EXPECT COLLEAGUES TO POLICE OTHER COLLEAGUES AND I DON'T BELIEVE THAT IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR WE ASK. PEOPLE TO BRING THEIR EVILS EN IT THERE'S BEEN A WORKPLACE ISSUE AND THEN VOTE ON WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM YOU KNOW THE LOG GUIDES US IN GUIDELINES GUIDE US. BUT I WILL ALSO SAY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ISSUES THAT ARE VERY MUCH WORKPLACE ISSUES ABOUT HOW PEOPLE WORK WITH EACH OTHER WHICH IS DIFFERENT. CAMPAIGN ISSUE OR ANOTHER TYPE OF ETHNICAL ISSUE SO HOW WOULD YOU. JUDGE THAT WOULD YOU ANTICIPATE CHO CLEARLY YOU THOUGHT ABOUT THIS. A PROCESS WHERE. YOU RULES AND HUMAN RESOURCES DEALS WITH ISSUES THAT THEY CAN DEAL WITH BUT WHEN THINGS SORT OF HIT CERTAIN THRESHOLD THAT WE ALL UNDERSTAND. OF CROSSING AN ETHICAL LINE THAT THEY WITH THEM BRING THE F. PPC CN OR WOULD EMPLOYEES GO DIRECTLY TO THE F. PPC WANTED AN ALLEGATION INVOLVES A MEMBER. HAVE YOU GIVEN THAT ANY THOUGHT DO YOU THINK THAT THAT'S ALL KIND OF TO BE DETERMINED WELL I THINK IT IT. COULD BE DETERMINED ALBUM BASED ON WHAT THE LEGISLATURE OBVIOUSLY FEELS IS THE MOST COMFORTABLE I DON'T THINK IT'S A QUESTION OF. WHAT'S THE BEST OR WHAT VOTE. EITHER WAY WOULD WORK ALTHOUGH. AND CERTAINLY A DOZEN AGENCIES SUCH AS A FPP SEE. WOULD BE SUITED TO DO THAT BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AS YOU AS YOU MENTIONED. ETHICS ISSUES SOME OF THEM CAN RELATE TO WORKPLACE. ISSUES TO AND SO. FPP SEE ALREADY HAS. GROUP THAT IS SET UP TO INVESTIGATE CASES AND OF OBVIOUSLY THESE DO HAVE. A LITTLE MORE. I'M. SENSITIVITY AND NAY PROBABLY WOULD REQUIRE MORE WITNESSES THEN WHAT NORMALLY IS DONE THROUGH FTP SI INVESTIGATIONS BUT. AN OUTSIDE AGENCY COULD DO ALL OF THE ABOVE AND MAKE IT I'M A LOT MORE. MAY BE A LOT MORE INDEPENDENT JUST IN GENERAL. SO YOU WOULD ANTICIPATE OR WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE THINKING IS IN THE SAME WAY THAT WHEN THERE ARE SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIMS. AGAINST MEMBERS THE LEGISLATURE CURRENTLY HIRES OUTSIDE INVESTIGATORS YOU WOULD. YOU SAY THAT THE SAME THING WOULD HAPPEN IT SHOWS THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THAT OVERSIGHT WHICH SHIFT TO THE F. PEOPLE SEED. TO BASICALLY HIGHER SORT OF THE SAME FROM THE SAME BUT I WOULD THINK LIMITED GROUP OF INVESTIGATORS THAT ARE THERE. AND THEN THE DECISION THAT WILL BE MADE AS TO WHT THE WHERE I'M AT AND WHETHER OR NOT. AFTER ALLEGATIONS SUSTAIN AND THE PENALTIES WOULD BE. EITHER SUGGESTED BY THE HAPPY PEACE HERE ACTUALLY ENFORCED AND SORT OF HANDED DOWN BY THE F. PPC. RIGHT WEALTHY WHAT THE F. PPC DOES AS THE COMMISSION IS THERE ARE TIMES THAT THEY WOULD LOOK AT A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE INVESTIGATOR. AND I'M SAYING. EITHER WE THINK THAT THERE IS. AN ERROR IN THE JUDGMENT. AND THAT THIS IS NOT A MATTER THAT IS ACTUALLY SEXUAL HARASSMENT OR THE REVERSE. I SO THE AT THE COMMISSION WOULD EXERCISE INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT IN THAT RESPECT WITH REGARD. IT'S NOT. COMMON BUT IT HAPPENS IT DOES HAPPEN. OF THAT. NOT ONLY DO YOU OF MAKE THE DECISION AT THE. AT THE COMMISSION LEVEL AS TO WHAT THE PENALTY SHOULD BE. BUT SOMETIMES YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THE INVESTIGATORS. ASSESSMENT OF A PARTICULAR CASE THE OTHER. ASPECT OF IT IS THAT THE F. PPC CAN DO WELL THERE. OVERSEEING THE INVESTIGATORS IS TO DETERMINE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WAS ALWAYS ON MY MIND. WHEN DEALING WITH THE OTHER ENFORCEMENT DIVISION AT THE F. PPC. IS WHETHER EITHER THEY ARE BEING. TO BLACKS OR BEING TOO ONEROUS AND SO YOU YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT PATTERNS. OF THE INVESTIGATORS TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY. A ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT THEY YEAR BEING. FAIR AND UNBIASED AS WELL. SO YOU WOULD COME BACK THEN THE UP PPC WOULD COME BACK WITH THE FINDING. BASIN INVESTIGATION THAT THEY OVERSAW BUT THEN WHAT WHAT THE PENALTIES BICU BECAUSE TYPICALLY WITH THE CAMPAIGN VIOLATION THERE WOULD BE A MONETARY PENALTIES SOMETIMES THERE COULD BE A CRIMINAL PENALTY. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND YOUR THE VIOLATION IS AGAINST AND EMPLOYEES IN THE LEGISLATURE. HOW WITH THE F. PPC THEN? IN RESOLVE THAT. RIGHT WELL THAT WOULD BE HAVE TO BE PART OF WHATEVER LEGISLATION. IS A. ULTIMATELY ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE AS TO WHAT THEY THINK THAT THE RANGE. OF WHAT WHAT THE RANGE OF AND. POTENTIAL PENALTIES SHOULD BE AB ACCORDING TO AS ONE OF THE PREVIOUS A PANELISTS TALKED ABOUT. DEPENDENT ON WHAT THE A HAPPENING. WITH THE VIOLATION ALLEGEDLY WAS AND WHAT IS FOUND. TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S COMMENSURATE WITH WHATEVER THAT IS SO DEFINITELY THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE NEW RULES NEW LAWS. THAT WOULD. GOVERNED. SUCH. OF A RULE FOR THE F. PPC IF THAT'S WHO IT WAS THAT YOU CHOSE AS OPPOSED TO STARTING UP ENTIRELY NEW COMMITTEE. AND WE'VE TALKED HERE ABOUT HAVING A MORE OBJECTIVE CRITERIA ABOUT WHAT PENALTIES WOULD BE FOR LEGISLATORS. AND JUST TO CLARIFY WHEN YOU MENTION THE COMMISSION ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE F. PPC ITSELF FOR A NEW COMMISSION MUCH JUST FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT. THAT IT COULD BE EITHER. IT COULD BE EITHER MEAN IT IT. PROBABLY CONVENIENT THAT IT ALREADY HAS. A COMMISSION PROCESS SET UP OLD LOW. AND. OBVIOUSLY I I WOULD GUESS THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE PRESENTLY ON THAT COMMISSION ARE PEOPLE. WHO ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN POLITICAL LAW PERHAPS OR ISSUES RELATED TOTO THE GOVERNMENT ETHICS? AND SO IT MIGHT BE AT A DIFFERENT GROUP OF COMMISSIONERS THAT MIGHT. BE BETTER SUITED TO HANDLE CASES SUCH AS THIS BUT THEIR COULD CERTAINLY BE COUNSEL WHO GUIDES THEM YES WHOSE ARM YOU KNOW. EXPERT IN THIS TYPE OF LAW BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THE PENALTY PART IS SOME. YOU KNOW HAS BEEN PRETTY CALM BROUGHT US MANY TIMES. OF THERE BEING A LACK OF CLARITY. FOR YOU KNOW FOR MEMBERS AND FOR OTHERS ABOUT WHAT PENALTIES ARE WHAT'S ALLOWED UNDER THE LAW. I'M IN IN THE PAST YOU KNOW PENALTIES OF RANGE FROM PEOPLE KEVIN COMMIT YOU KNOW THERE COMMITTEE CHAIRS TAKEN AWAY TO A TALKING. OKAY NOW THE OTHER. ES QUESTION I WOULD ASK YOU THAT'S GONNA RELATE BACK TO YOUR OWN UNCONSCIOUS OR CONSCIOUS BIAS. WHICH IS THAT PEOPLE AS WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH THIS PROCESS HAVE SUGGESTED A LOT OF DIFFERENT ENTITIES TO DO THIS ROLE WE'VE HEARD SUGGESTIONS FROM THE AUDITOR TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. A COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES HAS AN INTERNAL PROCESS FOR THEIR OWN PROMOTION INVOLVES. NINE OF CIVIL LAW JUSTICE I JUST. JUDGES WHO WERE THEN IN PANEL DIDN'T THREE BY THREE TO MAKE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO DEPARTMENT HEADS SO. THERE'VE BEEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT SUGGESTIONS ABOUT WHAT'S THE IF WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS WHAT'S THE CORRECT BODY I SERVED ON THE METROPOLITAN WATER. DID. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA METROPOLITAN WATER ONBOARD AND THEY HAD AN INTERNAL. ETHICS OFFICER WHO WAS INDEPENDENT WHO. DID THIS ROLE SO HAVE YOU GIVEN THOUGHT TO YOU GIVEN YOUR OWN UNCONSCIOUS BIAS OF HAVING RUN THE OF PPC. WHETHER WHAT THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES ARE OTHER BODIES AS OPPOSED AT PPC. RIGHT WELL. I. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO JUDGES AND RETIRED JUDGES. MANY OF THEM. IN. ARE NOT A. ARM WHILE THEY'RE IN GOVERNMENT IN A ROLE. THERE NOT THAT AND SENSITIVE TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY. AND SO I'M NOT SURE. THAT. IT WOULD. BE THE. RIGHT BODY CLUB. TO HANDLE SUCH A THING. I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE AG'S OFFICE INTERNAL ETHICS PERSON. BUT MY MY CONCERN ABOUT THAT FOR THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT JUST BE THAT. UP THAT PERSON WHILE THEY'RE INDEPENDENT. THERE. IN IN IN AN EXECUTIVE BRANCH OFFICE. ITH AN ELECTED OFFICIAL WHO IS THE HEAD OF THAT OFFICE. AND THAT MAY POSE. PROBLEMS FOR THE LEGISLATURE AS A WHOLE THEY MIGHT BE CONCERT THE CONCERNED ABOUT SOME. POLITICAL BIAS WITH RESPECT TO THAT PARTICULAR OFFICE BUT THAT'S A JUDGMENT FOR YOU TO MAKE. BUT FOR ME. BUT FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN NATIONWIDE NOT BLEEDING TO THESE ISSUES OF COURSE BUT. IN THIS INDEPENDENT TRULY INDEPENDENT GROUPS. TEND TO BE. VERY COGNIZANT OF. BALANCING ALL OF THE OTHER. INTERESTS AND TRYING TO BE ABSOLUTELY FAIR. GREAT WITHOUT I'M GONNA SEE IF ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. PERMITS RAVEL LOSSES HERE. S. INSPECTS. I THINK YOU. VEIL I THINK WHAT YOU DID FOR ME IN YOUR TESTIMONY. YOU REALLY ADDRESS THE BALANCE ISSUE THAT WE STRUGGLE WITH IN TERMS OF OUR TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO. OUR TAXPAYERS CLEARLY IF PPC ARLFC ALREADY HAS THAT RESPONSIBILITY. ARE BRINGING UP THE ISSUE OF THE NEW LAW SO THAT WE CAN DEAL WITH THE LEVELS OF ACCOUNTABILITY. AND PENALTIES IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST TIME PROBLEM THAT WE'VE GOT IS THE COMMISSION WHERE DO WE GO WITHOUT. ARE SO I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR VERY THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS I THINK MOST OF US AS ELECTED OFFICIALS OF HAVE FUN INTERACTION WITH A PPC. I WILL SAY THAT IN MY OWN CASE MANY YEARS AGO THE TIMELINESS OF IT FAILED AND I WAS REALLY. AFFECTED JOB FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS BY A JUDGMENT THAT WAS FINALLY RULED AROUND THE HOUSE BUT IT TOOK THREE AND A HALF YEARS. IN AFFECTED CERTAINLY ON MY MY MY BUSINESS AT THAT TIME. BUT YOU KNOW PEOPLE IN ACCOUNTABILITY AND MISTAKES HAPPEN IN MINUS CORRECTED BUT I THINK IN THIS INSTANCE SOMETHING THAT TOOK THAT LONG OUGHT TO. ADJUDICATE AND THEN FIND SOMEONE INNOCENT WHEN THEY WERE A PERCEIVED AS GUILTY FOR THAT AMOUNT OF TIME IS HORRIFIC IT'S HORRIFIC TO THEIR CAREER PATH AS YOUNG PEOPLE. IT'S HORRIFIC TO PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THIS FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BECAUSE OF TERM LIMITS MUST RETURN. OUGHT TO THEIR FORMER ALL CAREER ALSO WE HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY MINDFUL OF THAT AS WE GO FORWARD AND WE COME UP WITHOUT A LEVEL IN LIST. OF CONSEQUENCES AND HOW THAT WILL BE HANDLED IN I DO I VOTE I DON'T MAKE IT VERY PUBLIC I BUILT FOR TOTAL. OUR CONFIDENTIALITY UNTIL THERE'S A RULING THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE IN THE COURTS AND THAT CLEARLY IS WHAT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE ALL EMBRACE HERE. SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT PERSPECTIVE FORWARD I THINK I THINK LONG LONG OVERDUE THANK YOU BUT I AGREE WITH YOU I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HELLO TIMELINESS IS SOOOOOO CRUCIAL IN THESE. ADMITTEDLY THE. SEE HAS NOT ALWAYS HAD A GOOD RECORD UN IN THAT RESPECT UP BUT. IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHY. ANY ANY LEGISLATION IF THAT'S WHAT YOU DETERMINE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO SHOULD INCLUDE TARGETS FOR TIMELINESS. AND MY ISSUE IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AS A MAYOR OF A CITY MAHOOD AND WHETHER I DID OR DIDN'T HAVE ONE AND IT WAS ALL VERY SPECULATIVE AND A LOT OF PEOPLE BECAUSE OF OTHER ISSUES GOING ON. WE'RE ATTACKING THE WHOLE COUNCIL AT THAT TIME BUT IT TOOK THAT LONG. AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY MINDFUL OF HERE. THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS ON THE PANEL. THANK YOU MISERABLE REALLY APPRECIATE COMING THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME OUT OF LIKELY APPRECIATE IT. SO I WOULD ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS FOR THE PREVIOUS PANEL THERE WAITING PATIENTLY SHOULD I BRING THEM BACK UP. OKAY. RIGHT AND WE DO HAVE ONE MORE OF SPEAKER BUT WHY DON'T WE. FINISH WITH THE QUESTIONS WITH THE WHAT THE PREVIOUS PANEL ON THEM WILL BRING OUR LAST PANELIST UP. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I WANTED TO COMMENT. ON. BUT. OKAY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M I WANT TO COMMENT ON WHAT ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES SAID. ASSEMBLYMEMBER DOLLY ABOUT AT WILL EMPLOYEES AND REALLY THERE'S A WAY TO FIX THAT IF WE WANT TO ORGANIZE THE WORKPLACE AND WHEN MEMBERS ARE AND WHEN WORKERS ARE UNDER UNION CONTRACT. IT FIXES A LOT OF WHAT AILS US IN THE WORKPLACE BECAUSE THE EMPLOYERS KNOW WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO AND THE WORKERS KNOW WHAT THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO. SO I JUST THROW THAT OUT IS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD LOOK AT. I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT RETALIATION BECAUSE I THINK RETALIATION IS INCREDIBLY REAL FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO IS NOT ELECTED. THAT WORKS IN THE BUILDING AND THIS IS WORKING HERE IN THE CAPITAL IS NOT LIKE WORKING IN ANY OTHER PROFESSION. IF YOU ARE BLACK CALLED IF YOU ARE RETALIATED AGAINST WHERE DO YOU GO AND GET A JOB AND THIS MIGHT BE YOUR JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT THE ELECTED. YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT PUBLIC POLICY YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THINGS BETTER I KNOW I COULD DO MY JOB WITHOUT MY STAFF. SO THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT RETALIATION AND HOW. EVERYONE HERE WORRIES ABOUT THAT AND THEY'RE FEARFUL OF THAT. I INVESTIGATING GRIEVANCES FOR TWENTY YEARS WHEN I WAS IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT AND WE USE TO SAY THAT THERE'S TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY AND THE TRUTH LIES SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN. AND IT'S NOT EVER BECAUSE SOMEONE'S ACTUALLY LYING IT'S USUALLY SOMETIMES PEOPLE ARE LYING BUT USUALLY IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE JUST REMEMBER THINGS DIFFERENTLY SO SOMETIMES INVESTIGATIONS MIGHT TAKE A LITTLE LONGER BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TALK TO BROADER. A BROADER BASE OF PEOPLE AND I THINK WE SHOULD ALWAYS DO THAT PUMP ISS WEST I WANTED TO THANK YOU. FOR BRINGING UP THAT WE SHOULD NEVER PUT A TIME LIMIT ON INVESTIGATING BECAUSE WHAT I'VE HEARD. THROUGHOUT THE LAST MONTHS. SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID OH WELL WHY IS THIS COMING OUT IT HAPPENED SO LONG AGO. WELL IT'S BECAUSE AS PEOPLE COME FORWARD AND AS VICIOUS SO MANY WOMEN HAVE COME FORWARD IT MAKES ANOTHER WOMAN FEEL CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO COME FORWARD. SO WE CAN'T EVER SAY BECAUSE IT HAPPENED FIVE YEARS AGO TEN YEARS AGO THAT IT'S NOT VALID I THINK ABOUT THE. STATUE OF LIMITATION ON RAPE BILL THAT WE PASSED OUT OF. THAT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LAW A COUPLE YEARS AGO YOU CAN'T PUT A TIME LIMIT ON JUSTICE AND EVERYONE HERE SAW THAT THE GOVERNOR SAW THAT AND I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE. THAT WE'RE LOOKING OUT FOR STAFF THE WE'RE TAKING CARE OF THEM THERE ARE HUNDRED AND TWENTY OF US THAT WORK HERE IN THIS BUILDING AND I WAS ITS I AM LIKE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY LITTLE. OFF ON PRIVATELY OWNED BUSINESSES BECAUSE WERE ALL A LITTLE DIFFERENT WE ALL COME FROM DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE. BUTWE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE STAFF WHO WORK HERE BECAUSE. WHEN I'M TURNED OUT MANY OF MY STAFF STILL HAVE A CAREER AHEAD OF THEM AND THEY WILL WANT TO GO WORK FOR SOMEONE ELSE SO I JUST PUT THAT OUT THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE COGNIZANT. OF THOSE WHO REALLY HELP US HERE IN THE BUILDING THE ONES WHO CAN BE MOST TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SO WE HAVE TO HAVE POLICIES IN PLACE TO PROTECT THEM BECAUSE ALL OF US ELECTIVES ARE DIFFERENT AND WE ALL COME FROM A DIFFERENT PLACE. AND IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A STAFF BEFORE YOU WERE ELECTED YOU MAY NOT KNOW WHAT IS OKAY AND WHAT IS NOT OKAY TO DO SO I HOPE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE THIS AND WE WILL. WE'LL GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE. THANK YOU MAY I RESPOND MANAGER. HOME I. STAND FIRM WITH MY BELIEF THAT THE HUNT AT THAT THE ONE YEAR TIME LIMIT IN THE POLICY SHOULD SHOULD NOT BE THERE THAT ALL CLAIMS. OF HARASSMENT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED BUT I THINK THERE'S A COUNTER. ARGUMENT OR BALANCE TO THAT AND ONE AND I THINK WE WANT. VERY VERY STRONGLY TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO REPORT. RIGHT AWAY VERY QUICKLY OF FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS ONE SO WE CAN STOP THE CONDUCT STOP IT FROM ESCALATING. ALSO BECAUSE AS YOU JUST INDICATED ABOUT PERCEPTIONS AND MEMORIES THE LONGER TIME GOES BY MEMORIES FADE AS TO WHAT DID OR DID NOT OCCUR. SO WELL I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD EVER BE A TIME LIMIT ON INVESTIGATING A REPORT OF MISCONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE AGAIN IF THEY BRING SOME FORWARD IT HAPPEN TO THEM YEARS AGO. EITHER CONDUCT COULD BE HAPPENING TO THEM AND OTHERS. WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD IS MY PANEL MEMBER AND INDICATED BUT ALSO. WE NEED TO ADDRESS THINGS QUICKLY AND THE LONGER THE TIME GOES BY THE HARDER IT IS TO REALLY TRY TO. MAKE A REASONABLE DETERMINATION AS TO WHAT OCCURRED. IF I ME. I COULD NOT AGREE MORE WE WANT PEOPLE TO COME FORWARD BUT THAT'S ON US THAT'S ON US MAKING SURE THAT WE PUT IN PLACE SOMETHING THAT MAKES PEOPLE THAT THAT. EMPLOYEES IN THIS BUILDING STAFF IN THIS BUILDING FEEL SAFE AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEY CAN COME FORWARD BECAUSE I AGREE I DON'T LIKE TO EE PEOPLE SIT ON THINGS BUT I UNDERSTAND WHY IT HAPPENS. SO IT'S ON US TO TRY AND FIND A WAY THAT WE MAKE IT A SAFE ENVIRONMENT COME FORWARD AND AND I THINK YOU'VE TAKEN THE RIGHT STEP WITH THE RECENT WHISTLEBLOWER A BILL THE CAT SIGNED YES. THANK YOU ISRAEL'S. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU PANELISTS. THE AREA THAT I I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT IS CONFIDENTIALITY. THE RESERVES STATEMENT MADE THAT REPORTING IS THE VICTIMS CHOICE. I AGREE. BUT IN THE END AFTER THE VICTIM HOUSE. CHOSEN TO TO REPORT AND IT IS INVESTIGATED. THE ISSUE OF A CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSE FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE VICTIM. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT BUT I THINK I KNOW THAT IT YOU HAVE STRONG OPINIONS REGARDING THIS. IT'S BECAUSE THE END YOU'VE MENTIONED THAT IT HAS TO DO WITH. A PUBLIC POLICY. IT TRANSPARENCY AND I I RECOGNIZE ALL OF THAT. IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THE VICTIM IS ASKING FOR UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES IF ANY WOULD YOU FEEL THAT THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. SO AYE I ALSO WANTED TO ADDRESS THAT LABOR CODE TWO THREE TWO POINT FIVE ALLOWS AND ACTUALLY MANDATES. THAT THERE CANNOT BE LIMITATIONS ON DISCUSSIONS ABOUT TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT. SO THAT'S A LAW THAT ALREADY APPLIES TO THIS BODY. AND IF YOU'RE A AND SO I WANTED TO RAISE THAT IT ALSO WITH THE NLRB HEADED DECISION ABOUT CONCERTED ACTIVITY. AND YOU SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO GAG. INFORMATION FLOW DURING AN INVESTIGATORY PROCESS YOU REALLY HAVE TO QUESTION WHETHER THAT'S. AND IN KEEPING WITH CURRENT LEGAL STANDARDS SO I WANTED TO ADDRESS AT FIRST. SECONDLY I THINK. IT CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES ARE GAGGING THE VICTIM THAT'S WHAT THEY ARE. I AM IN DO WE AS A BODY THINK THAT AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY WE OUGHT TO BE GAGGING VICTIMS. AND I WOULD SAY NO. THERE'S MANY REASONS FOR THE US. BOB ONE IS IT IT CONTINUES THE CONDUCT THE UNLAWFUL CONDUCT IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T BRING IT TO LIFE IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T. A. LEAD TO ANY ADEQUATE REMEDIAL MEASURES SO. I THINK AS A MATTER OF PUBLIC POLICY WE SHOULD HAVE LIMITATIONS REGARDING SUCH CAUSES WHICH ARE UBIQUITOUS. A EMPLOYERS ASK FOR THESE AS A MATTER. OF COURSE WHETHER IT ACTUALLY BENEFITS THEM OR NOT THEY MAY WISH TO HAVE THEIR STORY COME OUT THEY MAY WISH TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT THAT'S NOT HOW IT WENT DOWN. AND WE TOOK THIS AS A BUSINESS DECISION ARM BUT IF. DATE UBIQUITOUS NATURE OF CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES PROHIBITS THAT SORT OF PUBLIC DISCUSSION AND I THINK. WHAT REALLY HAPPENS IS THE VICTIMS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE GAGGED IT'S NOT THE EMPLOYER? SO IT IT THAT'S WHAT I FIND IN MY PRACTICE IS THAT IF THERE'S A CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSE. IT'S REALLY THE WOMAN WHO CAN'T TELL HER DAUGHTER DON'T GO WORK FOR THAT MEMBERS DON'T GO WORK FOR THAT EMPLOYER. IT'S THE WOMAN WHO CAN'T. DISCUSS IT WITH HER THERAPIST ENEMIES ARE AGAINST PUBLIC POLICY AND I THINK THOSE THINGS HAVE TO STOP. NOT ONLY IN THE. ONE ON ONE INTERACTION OF GAGGING SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN THE VICTIM OF A CRIME WE DON'T SAY FOR HOMICIDE VICTIMS. IF TO BE SILENT. THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE HOMICIDE VICTIM IT'S THE SAME THING HERE THIS IS A CRIME. AND WE CERTAINLY SHOULDN'T ENABLE A CRIME BY KEEPING IT ILENT I THINK THE SILENCE. IS PART OF THE PROBLEM SO YES I DO HAVE VERY STRONG FEELINGS ABOUT IT. THERE ARE SOME. INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY CHOOSE BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID OF RETALIATION. I'M NOT TO COME FORWARD I HAVE AGAIN CLIENTS WHO REGULARLY RECIEVE PRESS CALLS AND THEY DECLINED THEM. AND THERE'S REASONS FOR THAT AND I THINK. THAT'S SORT OF CHOICE SHOULD LIE WITH THE SURVIVOR. BUT I DON'T THINK. IT SHOULD BE AS A MATTER OF LA A SURVIVOR OF HARASSMENT. CAN KEEP THINGS CONFIDENTIAL BY SIMPLY DOING NOT SPEAKING ABOUT IT. BUT NOT BEING MANDATED BY LAW NOT TO SPEAK ABOUT. SO. A VERY SIMPLE SOLUTION YOU JUST DON'T TALK ABOUT IT. BUT ALLOWING THOSE CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES TO PROCESS. I THINK CREATES THOSE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH TODAY. ALONG THOSE SAME LINES YOU. MIGHT COME SORRY DON'T RECALL WHO WAS THAT TALKED ABOUT IT. THAT VICTIMS ABOUT THE VICTIMS ABILITY TO GO STRAIGHT TO WEAVE. AND TO HAVE THAT AS A PROTECTED ACTIVITY BELIEVE IT WAS HERE. WEST. TELL US ABOUT WHY THAT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT THAT IT BE A PROTECTED ACTIVITY. AND THEREFORE CANNOT BE RETALIATED AGAINST YES SO WHILE I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD STEP TO ALLOW RESOURCES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO'VE BEEN SUBJECTED TO HARASS. TERMINATION RETALIATION TO BE ABLE TO GO SOMEWHERE TO OBTAIN THOSE SORT OF RESOURCES. IN ORDER TO GET THINGS LIKE THERAPY. BUT IF AS A BODY YOU'RE SAYING YOU CAN GO REPORT AGENCY AS A. BUT WE DON'T CONSIDER THAT REPORTER PROTECTED ACTIVITY WHAT THE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT IS IS IF THERE IS RETALIATION IN THE WORKPLACE. THAT IS NOT CONSIDER TO PROTECTED ACTIVITIES SUCH THAT DOT VICTIM THEN CAN HAVE LEGAL REMEDIES SITS THEY ARE. A SUBJECTED TO RETALIATION ADDITIONALLY. IT DOESN'T ALLOW THIS BODY TO LOOK AT WILL WHAT WIRE THERE THESE COMPLAINTS COMING OUT OF A CERTAIN MEMBERS OFFICE HOW CAN WE STEM THAT TIDE. ARE TOSE VALID COMPLAINTS INVALID COMPLAINTS.* SO IT DOESN'T ALLOW. IT IN THIS BODY TO TAKE ADEQUATE REMEDIAL MEASURES TO ADDRESS IT SO I THINK IT'S A WONDERFUL RESOURCE I'M VERY HAPPY THAT IT'S IN PLACE. BUT I THINK IT NEEDS SOME TINKERING TO ALLOW IT TO BE A PROTECTED ACTIVITY. OR TO SAY VERY CLEARLY IF YOU GO TO WE. YOU'RE NOT PROTECTED BY THE LAW. YOU MAY GET A RESOURCE THAT'S WONDERFUL ANY MAY GET RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH TRAUMA YOU MAY GET THERAPY THAT YOU NEED. AND THAT HAS ITS OWN VALUE. BUT. THAT NEEDS TO BE STATED UP FRONT. THAT THAT I HAVE CERTAIN LEGAL CONSEQUENCES AND ALLOWS THE PERSON IN THAT SITUATION TO DECIDE DO THEY WANT TO MAKE A COMPLAINT. AND BE COVERED UNDER THE LAW FOR PROTECTED ACTIVITY WATERGATE WANNA GET THERAPY NOT TALK ABOUT IT AGAIN THEY CAN MAKE THAT CHOICE BUT THEY OUGHT TO KNOW THE CHOICE THAT MAKE. ONE OF THE COMMENTS THANK YOU SO MUCH. ONE OF THE COMMENTS HAVE TO DO WITH. KEEPING THE INVESTIGATION. CONFIDENTIAL TOLD IT WAS A FINDING. GOES TO THE VERY PURPOSE OF OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM THAT OF DUE PROCESS IF YOU ARE BEING INVESTIGATED THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU ARE. HAVE BEEN CONVICTED YOU ARE BEING ACCUSED. BOB HOW DO YOU BALANCE THAT HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT YOU DO KEEP THESE INVESTIGATIONS. A CONFIDENTIAL DURING THE PROCESS SO THE TO DO PROTECT BOTH THE VICTIM. AND OF THE CUTEST. I THINK THE THIRTY EXISTS UNDER THE LAW MEANING EVEN IF I'VE BEEN THE VICTIM OF A SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN A MEMBER'S OFFICE. I SHOULD BE ALLOWED AND LEGALLY I AM ALLOWED TO TALK ABOUT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF MY EMPLOYMENT. THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I STAND NEXT DAY TO THE INVESTIGATOR IT MAY BE THE EXACT SAME CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THAT THERE'S A THERE'S A. A DELINEATION THERE THAT I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE. IF I'M SAYING I REPORTED EXPLAINS THE TO THE INVESTIGATOR WHILE THE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING THAT COULD AFFECT OTHER WITNESSES STATEMENTS. TALKING ABOUT THE EXACT SAME CIRCUMSTANCES BECAUSE IT IS THE CONDITIONS THAT EXIST IN MY WORKPLACE THAT'S LEGAL. UNDER LABOR CODE. TWO THREE TWO POINT FIVE AS WELL AS ANOTHER AND ALL OUR BE DECISIONS SO I THINK. TRENT WANTING TO TAP DOWN ALL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT IS ILLEGAL. AND IS SEPARATE AND APART FROM WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AN INVESTIGATION. BUT IF I MAY I I DO THINK I TOUCHED UPON THIS AS WELL AS COUNSEL FOR EMPLOYERS AND AS AS. A NEUTRAL INVESTIGATOR FROM TIME TO TIME HIRED BY OTHER. EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE INTEGRITY OF AN INVESTIGATION BE PROTECTED AND PART OF THAT IS TO KEEP CONFIDENCES FOR PEOPLE TO USE DISCRETION AND JUDGMENT WITH RESPECT WHO THEY TALKED TO WHEN THE INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING. FOR THE VERY REASON THAT WE DON'T WANT US STORIES OF WITNESSES TO BE INFLUENCED BY OTHER WITNESSES AND FOR THE VERY REASON THAT WE WANT THE INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS TO GO FORWARD. TOWARDS A REASONABLE CONCLUSION BASED ON WHATEVER THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS. IN OUR WORLD IT'S THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE YEARS AGO IS MY PANELISTS. MAKO PANELIST AT HAS INDICATED WE GOT A VERY STRANGE RULING FROM THE AN HOUR BE A BANNER CASE WHICH ESSENTIALLY SAID THAT THE LONG STANDING TRADITION OF INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATORS. GIVING WITNESSES INVESTIGATIONS AN ADMONITION AND THAT THEY SHOULD KEEP. WHAT'S DISCUSSED WITH THE INVESTIGATOR CONFIDENTIAL SO AS NOT TO RUN THE RISK OF. OF AT THE INTEGRITY THE INVESTIGATION WAS A UNLAWFUL PRACTICE UNDER SECTION SEVEN OF THE NRA THAT HAS BECOME A VERY DIFFICULT. DECISION FOR INDEPENDENT WORKPLACE INVESTIGATORS TO GRAPPLE WITH THEY DIDN'T SAY THAT YOU COULDN'T GIVE ANY ADMONITIONS TO WITNESSES AND AN INVESTIGATION IF YOU COULD IDENTIFY ACTUAL TANGIBLE. RISKS OF OTHER WITNESSES BEING INFLUENCED AND YOU CAN GIVE THAT ADMONITION YOU SHOULD NOT TALK TO SO AND SO BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THERE'S A RISK. BUT THE GENERAL OVERALL STATEMENT OF PLEASE KEEP THINGS CONFIDENTIAL USE GOOD JUDGMENT AND DISCRETION OF THE BANNER CASE SAID I WAS A VIOLATION OF SECTION SEVEN I AGREE WITH MY PANELISTS THAT. EMPLOYEES UNDER THE LABOR CODE HAVE A STATUTORY RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT BUT I DO STILL BELIEVE THAT. IN AN INVESTIGATION WE WANT TO KEEP THINGS. AS CONFIDENTIAL AS POSSIBLE PROTECT THE INTEGRITY INVESTIGATION UNTIL WE HAVE A DETERMINATION THAT IN FACT MISCONDUCT IN HARASSMENT HAS OCCURRED WE ARE DEALING WITH ALLEGATIONS EVERYBODY HAS A RIGHT. TO PARTICIPATE AND AND AND BE HEARD. FINALLY MADAM CHAIR. I THINK IT'S CLEAR FROM THE TESTIMONY THAT WE'VE RECEIVED THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT BALANCE. WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT AT THE VERY TOP OF THE LIST. THAT OUR VICTIMS TO COME FORWARD TO OUR BRAVE ENOUGH TO COME FORWARD THAT THEY ARE PROTECTED IN EVERY WAY THAT THEY CAN BE PROTECTED. AND THAT THE THE THEIR ALLEGATIONS ARE. ARE INVESTIGATED PROPERLY SO THAT WE COME QUICKLY TO A SOLUTION. IT'S CLEAR ALSO THAT THE ACCUSED WE DO HAVE DUE PROCESS. AND WE DO HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT THEIR HOUSE TO BE PROTECTION. FOR THOSE WHO ARE ACCUSED AND DUE PROCESS IS PART OF WHAT THE FABRIC OF OUR JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THE EMPLOYER HAS GREAT RESPONSIBILITIESWE'VE TALKED ABOUT STRICT LIABILITY AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO BE MINDFUL OF. BUT I ALSO WANT TO APPRECIATE. THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE REGARDING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO THE PUBLIC. THE PUBLIC PAYS. OUR SALARY THE PUBLIC PAYS THE SETTLEMENTS THE PUBLIC IS ABSOLUTELY. OUT HAS THE ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT IT IS WE'RE DOING. WE DO WANT TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC BUT THE PUBLIC DOES HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW. SO I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS I DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU I'M A BI FOR A THREE ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE TO. DETERMINE WHICH GROUPS ARE GOING TO BE. HAVE PROTECTED DISCLOSURE AND I'M GONNA DIRECT STAFF TO LOOK INTO MAKING. IT'S CLEAR THAT WE'VE WOULD BE ONE OF THOSE SOURCES ARM FOR PROTECTED DISCLOSURES SO I REALLY APPRECIATE PREMEDITATION FORD AND WILL MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE MEANT BEGIN THAT PROCESS DOES ANYBODY HAVE ANY LAST QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS WAS VERY REVEALING AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU.

WITHOUT I'M GONNA GO TO MY COLLEAGUES OF TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY CLOSING COMMENTS FROM ANYBODY. A COPY OF THE COMING. AND PUBLIC COMMENT IS THERE ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC YES PLEASE COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE. ON HELLO I'M SABRINA BRENNAN A HARBOR COMMISSIONER IN SAN MATEO COUNTY. AND I'M SPEAKING TODAY AS A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC I CAN TELL YOU FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. BACK COMPLAINTS AN INVESTIGATIONS AT THE COUNTY WIDE SPECIAL DISTRICT. BUT I'M ELECTED TO REPRESENT OUR SEVERELY MISHANDLED. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING REMARKS. THERE SHOULD BE UNIFORM ANTI HARASSMENT ANTI DISCRIMINATION AND ANTI RETALIATION POLICIES. LAWS WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTIONS. EDUCATION AND TRAINING ACROSS STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES. IN DEPTH ANTI HARASSMENT ANTI DOES DISCRIMINATION AND ANTI RETALIATION EDUCATION AND TRAINING SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT FOR ALL ELECTED AND APPOINTED REPRESENTATIVES. AND GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES CURRENTLY TRAINING LACKS INFORMATION ABOUT BEST PRACTICES FOR CONDUCTING INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS ONCE THE COMPLAINT IS MADE. ALL HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION OR RETALIATION COMPLAINT SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED AND THE FINING SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY THE CASE. TYPES OF INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR SHOULD BE CLEARLY DESCRIBED AND CONSEQUENCES SHOULD BE. WELL DEFINED. DOING THIS WOULD HELP MOVE CULTURAL NORMS IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION. INVESTIGATION SHOULD BE SELECTED ARTS SORRY INVESTIGATORS SHOULD BE SELECTED BY A PANEL OF THREE OR MORE PEOPLE. AND THE PANEL MUST INCLUDE BOTH WOMEN AND MEN. THIS IS NOT CURRENTLY THE CASE FOR SPECIAL DISTRICT CITY COUNCILS AND OTHER LOCAL AGENCIES. IN MANY CASES. A COMPLAINT AND COME THE COMPLAINT T. AND THE COMPLAINT AND THE COMPLAINT TENT SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH COPIES OF ALL INVESTIGATION REPORTS THIS IS ALSO NOT THE CASE CURRENTLY. RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT DISCIPLINARY ACTION SHOULD BE MADE BY A PANEL OR A REVIEW BOARD THAT INCLUDES BOTH WOMEN AND MEN. BUT COMMISSION OR STATEWIDE ELECTED BOARD MIGHT BE A LOGICAL OPTION FOR REVIEWING INVESTIGATIONS. AND DETERMINING OUTCOMES. HOWEVER MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE F. PPC. WHAT NOT LEAD ME TO BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS IN A TIMELY WAY I'M ADDING THAT JUST BASED ON THE TESTIMONY THAT HAPPENED TODAY? AN APPEAL BOARD COULD REVIEW DECISIONS IN THE EVENT THAT A COMPLAINT TEN OR COMPLAIN TO YOU WAS DISSATISFIED WITH AN INVESTIGATION OR AN OUT CON. OF AN INVESTIGATION. OF AN INVESTIGATION. RECENTLY I'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH NEIL MCCORMICK DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION. ABOUT THE NEED FOR ANTI HARASSMENT ANTI DISCRIMINATION. AND ANTI RETALIATION TRAINING. AND I THINK BIAS TRAINING IS ALSO EQUALLY IMPORTANT. THAT INCLUDES BEST PRACTICES FOR CONDUCTING UNBIASED AND INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS THERE IS NO TRAINING LIKE THAT CURRENTLY. HOWEVER I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT IT'S NOT REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT LOCAL AGENCY ASSOCIATIONS. LIKE CSTA AND THE LEAGUE OF CITIES OR AN OVERBURDENED STATE OVERSIGHT AGENCY WILL BE ABLE TO CORRECT THE LONG HISTORY OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. GENDER DISCRIMINATION AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE. AND IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT MANY OF THE OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS LACK. GENDER DIVERSITY RACIAL DIVERSITY AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION DIVERSITY IN MANAGEMENT POSITIONS ORGANIZATIONAL GOVERNANCE. CONSULTANTS HIRED TO GO UP TO PROVIDE TRAINING. AND NEWSLETTERS WEBSITES AND SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT. THIS PANDEMIC HAS BEEN% OVERLOOKED FOR FAR TOO LONG A COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE PLAN FOR ADDRESSING THESE COMPLEX PROBLEMS MUST BE THOUGHTFULLY DEVELOPED. AND FUNDED. IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WORK PLACES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA BE SAFE. AND FREE FROM HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION. I APPLAUD YOUR EFFORT TO SEARCH FOR CREATIVE SOLUTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE SPEAKER THAT ALL THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE. AND MANY OF THE ISSUES APPLY EQUALLY TO CITY COUNCILS AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS BOARDS. AND I'M HOPING THAT THE WORK THAT WE DO HERE HOPES UP GIVE IDEAS TO. THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ABOUT BETTER WAYS OF DEALING WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT WITH ELECTED AND APPOINTED OFFICIALS I'M IN THEIR ORGANIZATIONS. WITH FAT I THINK THE OF MEMBERS FOR BEING HERE ON THE PANEL I THINK IT WAS A ANOTHER VERY. LAMINATING HAND ALL AND SOMETHING THAT I KNOW IS GOING TO BE VERY VALUABLE TIME AS WE MOVE TOWARDS SHAPING A NEW POLICY. FOR THE LEGISLATURE AND US SOLVING OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE A SEXUAL HARASSMENT THANKS SO MUCH EVERYBODY
