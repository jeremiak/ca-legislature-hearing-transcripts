STRUGGLE FROM THE RANGE OF

00:29:34.038 --> 00:29:36.074
THINGS THAT COME UP ONE IT'S

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:38.276
JUST KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT

00:29:38.343 --> 00:29:40.812
ABOUT WHAT PARTS OF COMMUNITIES

ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

00:29:53.057 --> 00:29:56.194

00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:57.695
FROM OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEY

00:29:57.762 --> 00:30:00.665
LIKE TO HAVE MORE OF THAT. WHEN

00:30:00.732 --> 00:30:01.866
IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL PS PS

00:30:01.933 --> 00:30:04.068

REALLY CLEAR. HAVE GENERATORS

00:30:06.437 --> 00:30:08.806
IN MANY DON'T AND SO IT BECOMES

00:30:08.873 --> 00:30:09.274
A CHALLENGE TO PROVIDE

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.178
EDUCATION WITHOUT ANY POWER- SO

00:30:13.244 --> 00:30:14.646
FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE

00:30:14.712 --> 00:30:16.948
ARE FEEL THAT THEY CAN SAFELY

00:30:17.015 --> 00:30:19.284
REMAIN OPEN. DURING THE YES BE

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:21.352

CLASSROOMS ARE WITH THE- HEAT

00:30:24.522 --> 00:30:27.492
NOT ALWAYS THE BEST LIGHTING-

00:30:27.559 --> 00:30:30.662
DIDN'T INABILITY TO KEEP FOOD-

00:30:30.728 --> 00:30:33.331
PRESERVE FOR. STUDENTS MEALS-

00:30:33.398 --> 00:30:34.899
AND SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE

00:30:34.966 --> 00:30:35.533
THEY'RE ALL KINDS OF

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.402
CHALLENGES- THAT DISTRICTS

00:30:37.468 --> 00:30:40.905
FACE. DURING THESE TIMES- OF

00:30:40.972 --> 00:30:42.740
CHALLENGE IN SO THAT WE WOULD

00:30:42.807 --> 00:30:44.008
ASK THAT YOUCONTINUE AS YOU

00:30:44.075 --> 00:30:45.643

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:48.079
NEEDS A SCHOOL AND THEN ALSO

00:30:48.146 --> 00:30:49.147
ULTIMATELY THE QUESTION THAT WE

INSTRUCTION TIME. AND SO WHILE

00:30:53.785 --> 00:30:55.753

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:42.800
REMAIN OPEN WHAT'S HAVE AXES-

00:31:42.867 --> 00:31:45.436
GENERATORS- MAYBE SCHOOL NOT

00:31:45.503 --> 00:31:46.170
JUST LIKE THE STATE

00:31:46.237 --> 00:31:47.739
SUPERINTENDENT GEN AND THIS

00:31:47.805 --> 00:31:50.875
IMPACTS EMMONS. AWAY I'M IS

00:31:50.942 --> 00:31:52.076
REFER PATIENTS FOR FOOD BUT THE

00:31:52.143 --> 00:31:53.244
STATE'S WHICH ANIME. BUT ALSO

00:31:53.311 --> 00:31:55.380
MANAGE. FOR STUDENTS TO HAVE

00:31:55.446 --> 00:31:57.415
SPECIAL NEEDS FOR MEDICATION.

00:31:57.482 --> 00:31:59.183
SOME SCHOOLS SPECIAL RULES

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:01.085
SCHOOLS RUN ON WELL SYSTEMS.

00:32:01.152 --> 00:32:02.687
THEY NEED ELECTRIC PUMPS TO

00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:04.389
HAVE FLOWING WATER MANY OF THEM

00:32:04.455 --> 00:32:06.224
DID NOT. AND AS ANOTHER FACTOR

00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:07.692
THAT THEY HAD TO CONSIDER WHEN

00:32:07.759 --> 00:32:09.694
CLOSING SCHOOLS. AND SOMETIMES

00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:10.895
THESE ISSUES WENT BEYOND THE

00:32:10.962 --> 00:32:13.231
SCHOOL CAMPUSES THEMSELVES-

00:32:13.298 --> 00:32:14.599
TRANSPORTATION OF THERE'S NO

00:32:14.666 --> 00:32:17.702
FUEL IF THE GAS- GET THERE'S

00:32:17.769 --> 00:32:19.037
GUYS THERE'S NO GASOLINE FOR

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:20.505
THAT BUSES THEY CAN TRANSPORT

00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:22.507
STUDENTS. AND EVEN SOME TRAFFIC

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:23.808
LIGHTS YOU KNOW BEYOND THE

00:32:23.875 --> 00:32:25.143
SCHOOLS IF THERE'S NO TRAFFIC

00:32:25.209 --> 00:32:27.612
IT BECAME A VERY FOR SCHOOLS

00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:28.212
FOR STUDENTS TO WALK TO SCHOOL

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:30.782
SAFELY- OVERALL IT THE STATE'S

00:32:30.848 --> 00:32:32.750
A PLAN MENTION. HAVING AXIS TWO

00:32:32.817 --> 00:32:34.686
GENERATORS WAS A BIG FACTOR IN

00:32:34.752 --> 00:32:36.621
REMAINING OPEN. AND WE DID HEAR

00:32:36.688 --> 00:32:37.522
FROM SOME OF OUR COUNTY

00:32:37.588 --> 00:32:38.690

00:32:38.756 --> 00:32:40.591
NOT RECEIVE. A TIMELY AND

00:32:40.658 --> 00:32:41.392
ACCURATE INFORMATION WHICH IS

00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:42.727

00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:44.329
ACCORDINGLY WHEN MAKING

00:32:44.395 --> 00:32:45.096

00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:49.334
WITH THE PARENTS AND THE

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.802
COMMUNITY. AND WITH THAT I'D

00:32:50.868 --> 00:32:52.870

00:38:08.319 --> 00:38:10.221
IN THE STATES- THIS- TRACKS.

00:38:10.287 --> 00:38:11.922
THE INDEX BACK TO NINETEEN

00:38:11.989 --> 00:38:13.424
EIGHTY FOUR- AND YOU CAN SEE

00:38:13.491 --> 00:38:15.393
THE RISE AND OCCURRENCES AND

00:38:15.459 --> 00:38:17.161
FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCES. OF

00:38:17.228 --> 00:38:19.930
EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS AND

00:38:19.997 --> 00:38:20.564
TO AS NOTED ON THE SLIDE

00:38:20.631 --> 00:38:21.599
FIFTEEN OF THE TWENTY. FIVE

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:23.934
MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES IN THE

00:38:24.001 --> 00:38:24.502
STATE'S HISTORY OF OCCURRED

00:38:24.568 --> 00:38:26.804
SINCE TWO THOUSAND. NOW MOVING

00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:31.275
ON TO- THE- IGNITION CAUSES- I

00:38:31.342 --> 00:38:32.810
WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT THIS

00:38:32.877 --> 00:38:34.779
INFORMATION IS SYSTEM WIDE SO

00:38:34.845 --> 00:38:35.913
OBVIOUSLY THE MAJORITY OF OUR

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.915
MITIGATION EFFORTS- AND

00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:39.150
PROCEDURES THAT WE HAVE DURING

00:38:39.216 --> 00:38:40.551
ELEVATED CONDITIONS OCCUR IN

00:38:40.618 --> 00:38:41.819
THE HYPER THREAT DISTRICT BUT

00:38:41.886 --> 00:38:43.721
THIS- THIS TABLE IS SYSTEM

00:38:43.788 --> 00:38:45.856
WIDE- AND- GOES THROUGH THE

00:38:45.923 --> 00:38:48.726
VARIOUS CONTACT- CAUSES. OF OUR

00:38:48.793 --> 00:38:49.794
IGNITIONS IN OUR SERVICE

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.962
TERRITORY- AND YOU CAN SEE THE

00:38:52.029 --> 00:38:54.198
TOTALS OF THE BOTTOM GOING FROM

00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:57.201
THIRTY IN 200-015-2215 IN TWO

00:38:57.268 --> 00:38:59.370
THOUSAND NINETEEN- THE PART OF

00:38:59.437 --> 00:39:00.404
THE PIE CHART ON THE RIGHT.

00:39:00.471 --> 00:39:02.907
GOES OVER- THE CAUSES FOR THE

00:39:02.973 --> 00:39:04.108
LAST FIVE YEARS AND PERCENTAGES

00:39:04.175 --> 00:39:06.010
SO WE HAVE 35% THAT ARE BECAUSE

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:07.611
FROM FROM EQUIPMENT ISSUES. AND

00:39:07.678 --> 00:39:09.680
IT'S 65% OF SOME SORT OF

00:39:09.747 --> 00:39:10.981
CONTACT WITH WITH OUR LINES

00:39:11.048 --> 00:39:14.018
FROM FOR LARGER OBJECTS SUCH AS

00:39:14.085 --> 00:39:16.620
A- MYLAR BALLOONS. NOW MOVING

00:39:16.687 --> 00:39:18.355
ON TO THE- ACTIVITIES THAT ARE

00:39:18.422 --> 00:39:19.957
IN OUR TWENTY TWENTY WILD FIRE

00:39:20.024 --> 00:39:23.527
MITIGATION PLAN- THERE ARE

00:39:23.594 --> 00:39:24.128
SIXTY FIVE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:24.628
IN THE PLAN THESE ARE A-

00:39:24.695 --> 00:39:25.296
HIGHLIGHTS OF SOME OF THE MAIN

00:39:25.362 --> 00:39:25.796
ACTIVITIES THAT THAT ARE

00:39:25.863 --> 00:39:30.601
OCCURRING- THE FIRST TWO. OF

00:39:30.668 --> 00:39:31.202
WE'LL START WITH THE FIRST ONE

00:39:31.268 --> 00:39:32.236
SAYS HARDENING OF AS PART OF

00:39:32.303 --> 00:39:33.671
THE EVOLUTION OF OUR MITIGATION

00:39:33.738 --> 00:39:35.039
EFFORTS WE ARE INCORPORATING

00:39:35.106 --> 00:39:36.941
MORE UNDERGROUND IN THIS PLAN.

00:39:37.007 --> 00:39:38.309
OF THE REASON FOR THAT BEING IS

00:39:38.375 --> 00:39:39.510
WE HAVE CERTAIN PARTS OF OUR

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:41.212
TERRITORY THAT HAVE. THE

00:39:41.278 --> 00:39:43.914
TERRAIN AND FUELS AND WHEN

00:39:43.981 --> 00:39:45.950
CONDITIONS WORSE- CONSISTENTLY

00:39:46.016 --> 00:39:48.018
SEE ONE SPEEDS OVER SIXTY MILES

00:39:48.085 --> 00:39:49.854
AN HOUR WORDS JUST HARD FOR US

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.488
TO GET COMFORTABLE WITH HAVING

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:52.089
OVERHEAD. ENERGIZED FACILITIES

00:39:52.156 --> 00:39:53.424
THERE EVEN IF IT'S COVERED

00:39:53.491 --> 00:39:55.426
CONDUCTOR WITH. REPLACING HIGH

00:39:55.493 --> 00:39:56.861
RISK EQUIPMENT WITH VEGETATION

00:39:56.927 --> 00:39:58.195
MANAGEMENT ON ALL THOSE THINGS

00:39:58.262 --> 00:39:59.997
ARE STILL AN INHERENT RISK

00:40:00.064 --> 00:40:01.065
HAVING ENERGIZED FACILITIES

00:40:01.132 --> 00:40:02.700
OVERHEAD IN. IN THOSE REALLY

00:40:02.767 --> 00:40:04.802
RISKY AREAS. ANOTHER PART OF

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:05.803
OUR UNDERGROUND IN IS WHAT WE

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:08.139
CALL DIRECT UNDER GROUNDING AND

00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:08.773
WHAT THIS IS EXPRESS

00:40:08.839 --> 00:40:11.142
UNDERGROUND CIRCUITS OUT TO

00:40:11.208 --> 00:40:11.675
SOME OF THESE BACK COUNTRY

00:40:11.742 --> 00:40:15.412
COMMUNITY CENTERS. SO WE WOULD

00:40:15.479 --> 00:40:15.880
UNDERGROUND JUST THOSE

00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:16.814
COMMUNITIES. AND UNDER FEEDER

00:40:16.881 --> 00:40:18.349
THOSE SO WE COULD KEEP.

00:40:18.415 --> 00:40:19.717
CRITICAL FACILITIES ON TO

00:40:19.784 --> 00:40:21.118
SCHOOLS- AS JUST MENTION THE

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:23.954
OPENING REMARKS OF STORES-

00:40:24.021 --> 00:40:26.190
URGENT CARE CENTERS- COMMUNITY

00:40:26.257 --> 00:40:27.224
CENTERS WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO

00:40:27.291 --> 00:40:29.326
DURING DURING THESE EVENTS AND-

00:40:29.393 --> 00:40:31.428
SO THAT'S INCORPORATED IN OUR

00:40:31.495 --> 00:40:31.996
UNDERGROUND AS WELL IN THE

00:40:32.062 --> 00:40:32.863
CANTEEN WITH THEIR OVERHEAD.

00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:33.931
HARDENING EFFORTS WITH THAT

00:40:33.998 --> 00:40:35.332
WITH A HUNDRED FORTY FIVE MILES

00:40:35.399 --> 00:40:37.334
OF OVERHEAD HARDENING INCLUDING

00:40:37.401 --> 00:40:39.537
BEAR AND COVER CONDUCTOR. OVER

00:40:39.603 --> 00:40:41.338
THE THREE YEAR PERIOD- WE'RE

00:40:41.405 --> 00:40:43.507
GOING TO BE INSTALLING A THIRTY

00:40:43.574 --> 00:40:45.342
ADDITIONAL WEATHER STATIONS TO.

00:40:45.409 --> 00:40:47.378
PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION FOR US

00:40:47.444 --> 00:40:48.345
TO BE EVEN MORE PRECISE THEM

00:40:48.412 --> 00:40:53.217
ARE ARE AND IN. THAT INSTEAD OF

00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:56.554
US HAS FIVE CUSTOMERS. ONCE

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:59.924
EACH THE PROP CONDITION WERE

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:03.127
THE ROOT IS HI THE END. THAT

00:41:03.194 --> 00:41:06.463
MAYBE CALL DOWN TO THREE

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:08.899
HUNDRED SO AN EXAM OF USING. H.

00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:12.436
INCOME WITH THE LIES BASIS. WE

00:41:12.503 --> 00:41:14.939
ARE ALL WHY WE HAVE OVER ONE

00:41:15.005 --> 00:41:16.307
THIRD OF MOUNTAIN TOP I'M A

00:41:16.373 --> 00:41:17.174
RENT DEFINITION CAN WERE GOING

00:41:17.241 --> 00:41:17.775
TO BE IMPROVING THE TECH AND

00:41:17.842 --> 00:41:18.943
THE TO COMMUNICATE TO THOSE AND

00:41:19.009 --> 00:41:20.444
THIS THERE VALUABLE TOOL FOR A

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:21.679
WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THEY THE

00:41:21.745 --> 00:41:24.148
TO STAY CLEAN WITH AND THE BUT

00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:26.450
THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY POSSIBLE.

00:41:26.517 --> 00:41:28.018
AND THEN MOVING ON TO ENHANCE

00:41:28.085 --> 00:41:29.887
VEGETATION. THAT WE DEVELOP THE

00:41:29.954 --> 00:41:31.589
VEGETATION RISK INDEX IN TWO

00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:33.591
THOUSAND NINETEEN- THROUGH THE

00:41:33.657 --> 00:41:36.493
DATA ANALYSIS OF THE DATA AND

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:37.862
OUR DATABASE WE'VE IDENTIFIED

00:41:37.928 --> 00:41:38.963
FIVE SPECIES OF TREES THAT ARE

00:41:39.029 --> 00:41:40.731
MORE PROBLEMATIC THAN OTHERS-

00:41:40.798 --> 00:41:43.033
PINE PALM OAK EUCALYPTUS AND

00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:45.102
SICK MARKED A TO BE PRECISE-

00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:47.438
AND WE'RE LOOKING TO GO. BEYOND

00:41:47.504 --> 00:41:49.306
OUR TWELVE TO FIFTEEN FEET OF

00:41:49.373 --> 00:41:50.307
HOSE TRIM CLARENCE THAT WE

00:41:50.374 --> 00:41:53.410
CURRENTLY GET- TO UP TO TWENTY

00:41:53.477 --> 00:41:54.178
FIVE FEET DEPENDING ON THE

00:41:54.245 --> 00:41:55.246
SITUATION AND SO WE'RE TRYING

00:41:55.312 --> 00:41:58.048
TO- DO THAT TO FIFTY ONE

00:41:58.115 --> 00:41:58.749
THOUSAND OF OUR FOUR HUNDRED

00:41:58.816 --> 00:42:00.885
AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND TREES-

00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:02.853
IN THIS TIME PERIOD- THAT'S IN

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.688
THIS TIME PERIOD. I WERE ALSO

00:42:04.755 --> 00:42:06.390
DOING SOME FUELS MANAGEMENT-

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:08.292
WHERE WE HAD WE STARTED A PILOT

00:42:08.359 --> 00:42:11.095
PROGRAM LAST YEAR WHERE WE-

00:42:11.161 --> 00:42:12.429
AGAIN IN THE REALLY RISKY AREAS

00:42:12.496 --> 00:42:14.031
WE HAVE SOME FUEL BEDS THAT WE

00:42:14.098 --> 00:42:15.299
WANTED TO CLEAR TO REDUCE THE

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:17.034
POSSIBLE SOURCE CAN IGNITION.

00:42:17.101 --> 00:42:18.569
US WITH THAT FOR TWENTY FIVE

00:42:18.636 --> 00:42:20.371
MILES IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN

00:42:20.437 --> 00:42:20.971
SO WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE THAT

00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:22.072
PROGRAM OVER THE- THE THREE

00:42:22.139 --> 00:42:25.175
YEAR PERIOD HERE- ADVANCED

00:42:25.242 --> 00:42:26.877
PROTECTION. OF FIFTY FIVE.

00:42:26.944 --> 00:42:28.946
SUBSTATIONS A IN OUR HIGH FIRE

00:42:29.013 --> 00:42:30.915
THREAT DISTRICT. OF THIS TWENTY

00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:31.916
WILL HAVE ALMOST EVERY

00:42:31.982 --> 00:42:32.783
SUBSTATION WOULD HAVE ADVANCED

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:34.551
PROTECTION CAPABILITIES NOW AND

00:42:34.618 --> 00:42:35.853
WHAT THAT MEANS. AS WE HAVE

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:36.854
COMMUNICATION TO THOSE

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:38.422
SUBSTATIONS AND COMMUNICATION

00:42:38.489 --> 00:42:39.957
FROM THE SUBSTATIONS OUT TO THE

00:42:40.024 --> 00:42:41.025
PROTECTIVE DEVICES ON THE

00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:42.893
LINES. IT HELPS TO ENABLE OUR

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.695
SINCE THE PROFILE PROTECTION

00:42:44.762 --> 00:42:46.964
WHICH- THE QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE-

00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:48.499
IDENTIFIES FAULTS AND ISOLATES

00:42:48.565 --> 00:42:49.967
THEM LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF

00:42:50.034 --> 00:42:50.834
ENERGY AVAILABLE OBVIOUSLY

00:42:50.901 --> 00:42:52.736
LIMITING THE- A POSSIBLE SOURCE

00:42:52.803 --> 00:42:54.738
OF IGNITION. IT ALSO ENABLES

00:42:54.805 --> 00:42:55.739
ARE FALLING CONDUCTOR

00:42:55.806 --> 00:42:56.807
PROTECTION SO IF SOMETHING

00:42:56.874 --> 00:42:57.942
COMES IN CONTACT WITH OUR

00:42:58.008 --> 00:42:59.476
LINES. BRINGS THE LINE DOWN IT

00:42:59.543 --> 00:43:00.411
WILL BE ENERGIZED THE LINE

00:43:00.477 --> 00:43:01.812
BEFORE IT HITS THE GROUND

00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:03.714
OBVIOUSLY- MITIGATING THE

00:43:03.781 --> 00:43:05.316
POSSIBILITY ENDING MISSION THAT

00:43:05.382 --> 00:43:08.585
SITUATION I TALKED ABOUT THE S.

00:43:08.652 --> 00:43:09.620
ACTUALIZING DEVICES IN

00:43:09.687 --> 00:43:10.854
CONJUNCTION WITH THE WEATHER

00:43:10.921 --> 00:43:12.556
STATIONS- THERE'S DEFINITELY.

00:43:12.623 --> 00:43:14.358
DEFINITELY PS PS BENEFITS TO

00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:16.493
THAT- WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT IN

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:18.495
THE SECOND PRESENTATION. OF

00:43:18.562 --> 00:43:20.764
MICRO BRAIDS- SIMILAR TO MY

00:43:20.831 --> 00:43:21.999
DIRECT AROUND HIM OR WE'RE

00:43:22.066 --> 00:43:23.100
GONNA UNDERGROUND SOME

00:43:23.167 --> 00:43:24.501
COMMUNITY CENTERS TO PROVIDE

00:43:24.568 --> 00:43:25.502
SOME CRITICAL GOODS AND

00:43:25.569 --> 00:43:26.704
SERVICES TO THE BACK COUNTRY

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:29.206
COMMUNITIES- SOMETIMES IT'S

00:43:29.273 --> 00:43:30.374
MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO DO THOSE

00:43:30.441 --> 00:43:31.508
THROUGH MY CORPORATE SO WE'LL

00:43:31.575 --> 00:43:32.876
DO IT OF. A DEPLOYED

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:34.211
DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCE

AUCTION TANKS AND THINGS LIKE

00:44:04.074 --> 00:44:05.175
THAT. WE'RE GONNA EXPAND THAT

00:44:05.242 --> 00:44:06.977
PROGRAM OF IN THIS THREE YEAR

00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:08.712
PERIOD. AND IN LOOKING AT SOME

00:44:08.779 --> 00:44:10.114
BEHIND THE METER SOLUTIONS TO

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.782
SOAR GONNA PILOT- SOME

00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:14.318
DIFFERENT- TYPES OF GENERATION

00:44:14.385 --> 00:44:16.020
SO WE'RE GONNA LOOK AT. ENERGY

00:44:16.086 --> 00:44:16.920
STORED ROOFTOP SOLAR

00:44:16.987 --> 00:44:17.855

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:01.357
ABOUT PS PS IN THE SECOND HALF.

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:04.026

UTILITIES AT PRESENT OR MAYBE

01:06:17.239 --> 01:06:18.307
THERE'S A QUESTION THAT APPLIES

01:06:18.374 --> 01:06:20.076
TO ALL THREE FOR RESPONSE BUT

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:23.212
ALL TURN TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS

IF YOU HAVE ANY. QUESTIONS AT

01:06:23.879 --> 01:06:26.148
THIS TIME. FOR COMMENTS

01:06:26.215 --> 01:06:30.219
DUCKWORTH. I KNOW THERE'S

01:06:30.286 --> 01:06:32.421
CERTAINLY- CONCERNS BY EVERYONE

01:06:32.488 --> 01:06:34.323
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:37.760
POWERSHOT US BUT- COMPARED TO

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.729
HAVING TO FIRE I THINK THIS IS

01:06:39.795 --> 01:06:41.063
THE RIGHT THING I DO APPRECIATE

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:42.365
THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE TELLING US

01:06:42.431 --> 01:06:44.967
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE- TRYING TO DO

01:06:45.034 --> 01:06:48.604
THEM LESS EXPANSIVELY- SPECTRA.

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:51.207
I THINK IT'S JUST EXTREMELY

01:06:51.273 --> 01:06:53.142
IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T. THAT

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:54.744
EVEN THOUGH WE MAY BE CONCERNED

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:56.412
ABOUT THE POWER SHUT OFF THAT

01:06:56.479 --> 01:06:58.781
YOU CONTINUE TO DO THAT- AND

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:01.817
NOT BE. INTIMIDATED FROM DOING

01:07:01.884 --> 01:07:03.352
THEM WHEN IT'S THE RIGHT THING

01:07:03.419 --> 01:07:06.355
TO REDUCE RISK I KNOW THAT. IN

01:07:06.422 --> 01:07:08.924
THE CASES OF RPG AND I'M IN

01:07:08.991 --> 01:07:11.160
THAT SERVICE AREA- THERE WERE A

01:07:11.227 --> 01:07:13.796
NUMBER OF- PLACES WHERE THE

01:07:13.863 --> 01:07:15.664
LINES HAVE BEEN G. ENERGIZED.

01:07:15.731 --> 01:07:17.967
AND THERE ARE MANY POSSIBLE

01:07:18.033 --> 01:07:20.302
SITES OF IGNITION SO I THINK

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:22.338
WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. AND

01:07:22.405 --> 01:07:23.973
THEM I KNOW YOU'LL BE IMPROVING

01:07:24.039 --> 01:07:26.275
ON YOUR TECHNIQUES AS TIME GOES

01:07:26.342 --> 01:07:30.746
ON THANK YOU. FOR FOCUS A

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:32.548
LITTLE BIT MORE INTENTLY ON PSP

01:07:32.615 --> 01:07:33.816
US IN THE NEXT SEGMENT BUT LET

01:07:33.883 --> 01:07:35.084
ME JUST ASK A QUESTION IN TERMS

01:07:35.151 --> 01:07:37.486
OF YOU KNOW WHEN ARE WE SAFE.

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:38.387
AND THIS IS A PROCESS THAT

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:39.955
WE'RE GOING THROUGH AN

01:07:40.022 --> 01:07:40.756
OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:42.591
THAT. AT THE END OF THE DAY

01:07:42.658 --> 01:07:45.594
THAT THE CUSTOMERS ON ONLY FILL

01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:47.963
SAY BUT ARE. AND THE DIFFERENT

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:49.932
ASPECTS OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING

01:07:49.999 --> 01:07:52.735
YOU KNOW THEY FIT INTO A- YOU

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:56.505
KNOW A- NEED SCHEDULE- THERE'S

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:59.408
A POINT. THE WHERE WE NEED TO

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:01.110
BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:02.611
ARE SAFE AND HOW WE CAN PARSE

01:08:02.678 --> 01:08:04.814
OUT THESE DIFFERENTPIECES TO

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:06.849
HIT TIME FRAMES THAT- WE CAN

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:09.318
KIND OF RELY ON- I WAS LOOKING

01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:11.320
AT THE CHART WHERE IT

01:08:11.387 --> 01:08:14.290
DESCRIBES. A AND THIS IS

01:08:14.356 --> 01:08:15.357
JEANNIE BUT I THINK ALL OF YOU

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:16.992
HAD REFERENCED IN YOUR YOUR

01:08:17.059 --> 01:08:19.562
REPORT AT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:08:19.628 --> 01:08:22.665
AND RELATES TO- P. JEANNIE

01:08:22.731 --> 01:08:23.232
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CIRCUIT

01:08:23.299 --> 01:08:25.901
MILES. OF P. JEANNIE SYSTEM ARE

01:08:25.968 --> 01:08:28.571
LOCATED IN HIGH- FIRE THREAT

01:08:28.637 --> 01:08:32.341
AREAS- AND THEN THE NEXT- SLIDE

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:34.810
OVER HEAD. UNDER ENHANCE

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.145
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AS AN

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:38.581
EXAMPLE IT DESCRIBES THE TWENTY

01:08:38.647 --> 01:08:40.149
TWENTY TARGETED EIGHTEEN

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:43.519
HUNDRED MILES. LINE MILES- SO

01:08:43.586 --> 01:08:47.923
HOW. LOOKING AT THE LONG LOOK

01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.491
AT ALL OF THE YEAR THAT YOU

01:08:48.557 --> 01:08:49.391
HAVE TO COVER IN A LOT OF TO

01:08:49.458 --> 01:08:51.260
COVER. YOU FOR VIEWING THE LONG

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:53.996
TERM IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN HOW

01:08:54.063 --> 01:08:55.798
YOU CAN GET TO A PLACE WHERE.

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:56.866
YOU'RE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO

01:08:56.932 --> 01:08:58.601
THE PUBLIC WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO

01:08:58.667 --> 01:08:59.768
GET THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

01:08:59.835 --> 01:09:02.505
MILES. LINE MILES- ADDRESS SO

01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:04.073
THAT THERE'S A SENSE OF TIMING

01:09:04.139 --> 01:09:05.774
AND WHEN THAT TAKES PLACE AND-

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:06.709
HOW THAN WE CAN GET A BETTER

01:09:06.775 --> 01:09:11.547
SENSE ON. SAFETY SO FOR I THINK

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:13.682
YOU KNOW RECOGNITION THAT THE

01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:15.251
PUBLIC SAFETY POWERSHOT OF

01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:17.353
EVENTS A REALLY IMPACTFUL TO

01:09:17.419 --> 01:09:20.356
OUR COMMUNITIES MY FAMILY WHEN

01:09:20.422 --> 01:09:22.491
IT WENT THROUGH A- P. S. P. S.

01:09:22.558 --> 01:09:24.326
EVENTS AT OUR HOME. AS WELL AND

01:09:24.393 --> 01:09:27.296
SO. TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THE

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:28.797
IMPACT TO THE COMMUNITIES THERE.

01:09:28.864 --> 01:09:31.800
AS AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:35.704
RIGHT NOW. THAT'S WHAT PGA ANY

01:09:35.771 --> 01:09:37.273
BELIEVES WE NEED TO DO I

01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:39.308
BELIEVE THE OTHER INVESTOR

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:40.442
OWNED UTILITIES FEEL THE SAME

01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:42.678
WHEN THE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:44.947
SUCH THAT IT'S NOT SAFE TO

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:48.918
LEAVE THAT THE LINES ENERGIZED

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:50.853
THAT WE DE ENERGIZED THEM. I

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:51.954
THINK WHAT EVERYBODY REALLY

01:09:52.021 --> 01:09:53.322
WANTS TO NOW I THINK WHAT

01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:56.525
YOU'RE GENERALLY ASKING IS-

01:09:56.592 --> 01:09:57.860
WHEN WILL THE P. S. P. S.

01:09:57.927 --> 01:10:01.897
EVENTS AND- HARDER TO SAY THAT

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:03.933
BECAUSE I THINK WE ALL BELIEVE

01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:05.634
WE NEED TO HAVE THAT TOOL IS A

01:10:05.701 --> 01:10:07.937
REAL LAST RESORT IN OUR IN OUR

01:10:08.003 --> 01:10:11.106
TOOLBOX. BUT THE THINGS THAT

01:10:11.173 --> 01:10:12.875
WE'RE DOING WITH THE VAJRAYANA

01:10:12.942 --> 01:10:14.843
JUDGMENT. WITH THE CLEARING

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:17.279
AROUND THEIR SIXTY AND SEVENTY

01:10:17.346 --> 01:10:21.183
KV LINES. WITH THE SECTION THE

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:23.285
LACE SEXUAL RISING DEVICES THAT

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:25.688
WE'RE PUTTING INTO PLACE TO

01:10:25.754 --> 01:10:28.457
ISOLATE ONLY THE AREAS THAT ARE

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:30.392
GOING TO SEE. THE SIGNIFICANT

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:32.861
WEATHER IMPACTS ARE THINGS THAT

01:10:32.928 --> 01:10:34.597
WE ARE DOING TO ENSURE

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:39.835
COMMUNITY SAFETY. YEAH IF

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:41.770
MILLIMETERS TO ABOUT TO FIND A

01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:43.539
POINT IN TERMS OF THE DATES- IN

01:10:43.606 --> 01:10:44.673
TERMS OF HOW TO COME UP WITH

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.542
THE DATES FOR COMPLETION OF THE

01:10:46.609 --> 01:10:50.245
WORK THAT. ADDRESSES THE

01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:52.281
MAGNITUDE OF THE COVERAGE THE

01:10:52.348 --> 01:10:54.950
LINES WHICH AND HOW YOU CAN GET

01:10:55.017 --> 01:10:56.218
TO THAT PONT SO THAT THE

01:10:56.285 --> 01:10:58.787
PUBLIC KNOWS WHEN YOU WILL HAVE

01:10:58.854 --> 01:11:01.624
ACCOMPLISHED OF BASED ON TIME

01:11:01.690 --> 01:11:06.829
FRAMES THE GOAL OF SAFETY AND

01:11:06.895 --> 01:11:10.799
LINE SECURITY. SO IT'S A GOOD

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:12.201
QUESTION THIS IS UNDER FROM

01:11:12.267 --> 01:11:16.705
EACH ANY AND IT'S GOOD SO THAT

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:18.974
WE TALKED A LOT BECAUSE THIS IS

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:20.342
THE TO RIGHT YOU WE HAVE THIS

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:22.478
MAP THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT AND

01:11:22.544 --> 01:11:23.679
WHAT THOSE LINE MILES ARE WE

01:11:23.746 --> 01:11:24.780
THE CLAIM IS CONTINUING TO

01:11:24.847 --> 01:11:26.181
CHANGE AND THAT WILL CONTINUE

01:11:26.248 --> 01:11:30.419
TO EVOLVE. AND SO WE ARE BEING

01:11:30.486 --> 01:11:31.020
CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE TO

01:11:31.086 --> 01:11:33.088
EVOLVE IN THE EXAMPLE OF

01:11:33.155 --> 01:11:33.989
ENHANCE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

01:11:34.056 --> 01:11:36.025
WE- LAID OUT IN OUR REGULAR OUR

01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:37.726
GENERAL RATE CASE THAT WE HAD A

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:39.495
TEN YEAR PLAN TO GET TO ALL OF

01:11:39.561 --> 01:11:40.863
THE MILES WITH THIS ENHANCE%

01:11:40.929 --> 01:11:41.664
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT

01:11:41.730 --> 01:11:43.732
TREATMENT. BUT WE'RE STARTING

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:46.669
WE USE A LOT OF- MODELS TO

01:11:46.735 --> 01:11:47.603
IDENTIFY WHERE THE HIGHEST RISK

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:49.772
AREAS ARE SO IT'S NOT AN EVEN

01:11:49.838 --> 01:11:51.507
PACE IN TERMS OF RISK REDUCTION

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:52.574
WE'RE STARTING IN THE AREAS

01:11:52.641 --> 01:11:54.043
THAT HAVE THE MOST BANG FOR OUR

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:55.477
BUCK IN TERMS OF TREATING THE

01:11:55.544 --> 01:11:57.513
VEGETATION AND REMOVING RISK.

01:11:57.579 --> 01:11:58.347
SAME THING ON OUR SYSTEM

01:11:58.414 --> 01:12:01.016
HARDENING- PROGRAM WHERE WERE

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:02.117
HARDENING THE LINES ARE PUTTING

01:12:02.184 --> 01:12:04.720
THEM UNDERGROUND AND SO- THOSE

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:07.122
ARE LONG TERM PROGRAMS RIGHT

01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.623
TEN YEARS TO DO ALL THE

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:09.358
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT IS NOT AS

01:12:09.425 --> 01:12:11.026
FAST AS WE WOULD ALL LIKE IT TO

01:12:11.093 --> 01:12:12.961
BE. BUT WE'RE USING THE BEST

01:12:13.028 --> 01:12:14.596
DATA WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US TO

01:12:14.663 --> 01:12:16.331
IDENTIFY THE AREAS MOST AT RISK

01:12:16.398 --> 01:12:18.033
OF AN IGNITION AND MOST AT RISK

01:12:18.100 --> 01:12:19.568
OF A CATASTROPHIC SPREAD SO

01:12:19.635 --> 01:12:22.805
THAT WE CAN- AND IMPROVE SAFETY

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:26.909
THE FACT IS. IF THE RESOURCES

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:29.011
AND- THE BILL IT IS PART. WITH

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:31.513
THESE LARGE SCALE PROGRAMS.

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.449
THANK YOU EXCEPT MAYBE THE ONLY

01:12:33.515 --> 01:12:34.983
THING SO COME THINGS WILL LIKE

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:37.953
TO HAVE THE CON UP. THAT IS A

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:38.887
WE'RE ALL WORKING AS HARD AS WE

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:41.623
CAN FIND AN ANSWER TO I THERE'S

01:12:41.690 --> 01:12:43.258
A FEW THINGS WE ARE DEALING

01:12:43.325 --> 01:12:44.626
WITH A HIGH ENERGY SYSTEM I

01:12:44.693 --> 01:12:46.128
THINK EVERYBODY REALIZES THAT

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:50.232
SO GETTING TO ZERO- I THINK IS-

01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:51.734
THAT THAT'S THAT'S A LOOSE OF-

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:52.835
IN OUR BENCHMARKING WITH

01:12:52.901 --> 01:12:55.070
OVERSEAS UTILITIES- THEY

01:12:55.137 --> 01:12:56.739
PROJECTED. AFTER SEVERAL YEARS

01:12:56.805 --> 01:12:58.507
OF HARDENING UP STILL SEEING

01:12:58.574 --> 01:13:00.309
NATION'S OTHER SYSTEM I THINK

01:13:00.375 --> 01:13:01.276
WHAT'S IMPORTANT THOUGH IS THAT

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:03.278
WE LOOK AT THIS FROMA RISK

01:13:03.345 --> 01:13:04.446
STANDPOINT AND IT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:06.281
DOING. WE HAVE IN OUR

01:13:06.348 --> 01:13:07.082
DISTRIBUTION NETWORK IN HIGH

01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:09.618
FAR RISKIER IS ROUGHLY TEN

01:13:09.685 --> 01:13:11.286
THOUSAND CIRCUIT MILES. BY THE

01:13:11.353 --> 01:13:12.654
END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE-

01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:14.690
WILL OF COVERED AROUND SIX

01:13:14.757 --> 01:13:15.924
THOUSAND OF THOSE MILES SO

01:13:15.991 --> 01:13:17.860
PRETTY RAPID- RAPID COVERING AT

01:13:17.926 --> 01:13:20.395
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE- BUT MUCH

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:22.631
AS MATT SAID- WE'RE NOT DOING

01:13:22.698 --> 01:13:24.700
THIS IN A- I'D SAY PANCAKE

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:27.102
FASHION OR BEING ABOUT FACTION

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.970
BUT WE'RE DOING IS HIGHLIGHTED

01:13:28.036 --> 01:13:29.371
WHAT IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:31.640
AREAS IT FIRST. AND FRANKLY

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:32.875
THOSE WE'VE ACTUALLY COVERED

01:13:32.941 --> 01:13:34.810
ALREADY SO THAT SITTING THE

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:35.811
THREAT OF EMISSIONS AND ALSO

01:13:35.878 --> 01:13:37.813
HITTING THE CONSEQUENCE SIDE OF

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.615
IT RIGHT AWAY- THERE ARE OTHER

01:13:39.681 --> 01:13:41.850
VARIABLES I THINK THE LATEST

01:13:41.917 --> 01:13:45.354
OUR THE UTILITY BECAUSE- OR YOU

01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:47.356
TO. AROUND 10% WHILE FIVE SO

01:13:47.422 --> 01:13:49.491
THAT ANOTHER FACTOR. WHAT WE

01:13:49.558 --> 01:13:50.893
ALL THE SCENE AND I THINK WHAT

01:13:50.959 --> 01:13:53.529
WE CAN TO LEAVE IT SHARE THE

01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:56.999
WITH WITH THE SAN IS. MANY

01:13:57.065 --> 01:14:01.570
PIECES TO UTILITY IN. DRIVING

01:14:01.637 --> 01:14:02.171
THOSE TWO ZERO QUICK AS WE CAN

01:14:02.237 --> 01:14:03.739
AND USING OUR TARP COLLUDED

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:06.708
THAT HARDING PS S. OPERATION

01:14:06.775 --> 01:14:10.245
PRACTICE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT.

01:14:10.312 --> 01:14:12.147
FOCUSED THE THINGS WE CAN GET

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:14.416
AWAY OF BUDGET TO MANAGE IT

01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:16.318
PAYS OFF REAL REAL QUICK YOU

01:14:16.385 --> 01:14:17.452
CAN TURN YOUR WHOLE SYSTEM IN A

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:19.188
YEAR AND YOU'VE GOT THE BENEFIT

01:14:19.254 --> 01:14:22.791
BUT ALSO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:25.994
FIVE A RESPONSE KEEP WE'VE SEEN

01:14:26.061 --> 01:14:28.897
THAT VERY. AND THE OF REACTIONS

01:14:28.964 --> 01:14:31.500
PURCHASED CAN PLAY A BIG ROLE

01:14:31.567 --> 01:14:32.935
IN ALL MITIGATING AND GET A

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:34.903
ARGUE CENTER IF YOU SAFE AS

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:49.751
WELL. I JUST WANT TO- GO BACK

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:51.320
TO THE CHAIRS QUESTION BECAUSE

01:14:51.386 --> 01:14:53.722
I THINK THAT IS. ULTIMATELY THE

01:14:53.789 --> 01:14:54.790
MOST IMPORTANT THING. THAT WERE

01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:56.491
RESPONSIBLE FOR WE NEED TO BE

01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:58.393
ABLE TO TELL THE CUSTOMERS.

01:14:58.460 --> 01:15:00.162
THAT YOU CAN NEXT YOU CAN

01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:01.196
EXPECT THAT THIS IS A TIME

01:15:01.263 --> 01:15:03.232
LINE. YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S NEVER

01:15:03.298 --> 01:15:05.567
GOING TO BE ZERO. BUT WE HAVE

01:15:05.634 --> 01:15:08.170
TO HAVE A PLAN TO. GET TWO ZERO

01:15:08.237 --> 01:15:09.271
AND GET AS CLOSE TO THAT AS

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:12.241
POSSIBLE SO. THAT ULTIMATELY IS

01:15:12.307 --> 01:15:15.644
THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION IS.

01:15:15.711 --> 01:15:17.112
WHAT WAS YOUR QUESTION AGAIN.

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:20.382
IS WHEN WE SAY. IT IS WHEN WE

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:22.584
SAY WHAT DO WHAT DO WE- WHAT IS

01:15:22.651 --> 01:15:24.653
A TIME LINE SO THAT WE CAN TELL

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:27.789
ARE THE CUSTOMERS. BY THIS TIME

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.491
WE EXPECT YOU TO BE SAFE.

01:15:29.558 --> 01:15:31.727
NOBODY FEEL SAFE RIGHT NOW. I

01:15:31.793 --> 01:15:33.929
I'D I THINK THAT'S A- THAT

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:35.130
THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE ALL

01:15:35.197 --> 01:15:38.667
WORKING TOWARDS- AND I THINK

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:40.102
THIS IS A IS A KEY QUESTION. ON

01:15:40.168 --> 01:15:42.237
A BRING MAYBE TO THE FOR OUR

01:15:42.304 --> 01:15:42.771
TWENTY TWENTY WHILE FIRE

01:15:42.838 --> 01:15:44.673
MITIGATION PLANS AND- AS YOU

01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:46.608
LOOK TO THOSE- ONE OF THINGS

01:15:46.675 --> 01:15:47.609
WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO DO IS

01:15:47.676 --> 01:15:49.044
FORECAST TO DECLINE IN THE

01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:51.146
NATION'S. NOW IT'S A RELATIVELY

01:15:51.213 --> 01:15:52.814
STRAIGHTFORWARD A WAY OF

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:55.250
APPROACHING IT BUT- BUT LOOKING

01:15:55.317 --> 01:15:56.885
AT HOW WE'RE PERFORMING IN THE

01:15:56.952 --> 01:15:59.221
END OF THE ANALYSIS WE NEED TO

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:00.355
SEE THAT EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:02.724
IS ACTUALLY RESULTING IN FEWER

01:16:02.791 --> 01:16:04.393
EMISSIONS. AND LOWER

01:16:04.459 --> 01:16:05.527
CONSEQUENCE WHEN THERE ARE

01:16:05.594 --> 01:16:08.030
NATIONS- AS WE LOOK TO THESE

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:09.631
PLANS AND AS I LOOK AT OUR

01:16:09.698 --> 01:16:10.832
PLANS WE ARE IN A MUCH BETTER

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:12.434
PLACE THAN WE WERE LAST YEAR.

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:13.368
WE WILL BE IN A MUCH MUCH

01:16:13.435 --> 01:16:16.305
BETTER PLACE NEXT YEAR AS WE

01:16:16.371 --> 01:16:16.805
CONTINUE TO DEPLOY THESE

01:16:16.872 --> 01:16:19.441
MEDICATIONS AND THAT'S THE PATH

01:16:19.508 --> 01:16:21.243
AND THAT'S THE JOURNEY WERE ON.

01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:22.544
WHAT WE DON'T HAVE A DATE OR WE

01:16:22.611 --> 01:16:24.513
CAN SAY IT'S SAFE BECAUSE I

01:16:24.579 --> 01:16:25.948
THINK THERE'S SO MANY VARIABLES

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:28.050
AND WE'RE INVESTING AND ART AND

01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:30.652
ART TIME. AND OUR AND OUR

01:16:30.719 --> 01:16:32.387
EFFORTS IN MAKING SURE WE GET

01:16:32.454 --> 01:16:34.256
THERE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE-

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:35.023
WE HAVE TO GET THROUGH ANOTHER

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:37.092
WILDFIRE SEASON I THINK WE CAN

01:16:37.159 --> 01:16:38.427
LOOK AT OUR SYSTEM NOW AND SAY.

01:16:38.493 --> 01:16:40.062
IT IS MUCH SAFER THAN IT WAS

01:16:40.128 --> 01:16:40.963
LAST YEAR AND WE'RE ONNA

01:16:41.029 --> 01:16:43.031
CONTINUE IMPROVE ON THAT- AND

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:48.971
THAT PROGRESS. THANK YOU. WHAT

01:16:49.037 --> 01:16:50.639
THANK THANK YOU AND THIS IS

01:16:50.706 --> 01:16:51.907
JUST A GENERAL QUESTION WHY

01:16:51.974 --> 01:16:53.241
SHOULD PRIME MORE DIRECTED

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:54.576
TOWARD EACH UNIQUE SAYS MY

01:16:54.643 --> 01:16:58.680
SERVICE SURGERY SO- HOW HOW ARE

01:16:58.747 --> 01:17:00.549
YOU PRIORITIZING ARE YOU ARE

01:17:00.615 --> 01:17:03.885
YOU PRIORITIZING THE HIGHEST

01:17:03.952 --> 01:17:05.354
RISK AREAS AND IT RELATIVE TO

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.823
SEE PUBLIC SAFETY- HOW ARE YOU

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:08.390
HOW ARE YOU PART WHICH ISING

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:10.359
ARE USING ARE USING FOR EXAMPLE

01:17:10.425 --> 01:17:11.927
WE'VE I'M AWARE OF THE COMPANY

01:17:11.994 --> 01:17:13.061
CALLED TECHNO SOBRE USING

01:17:13.128 --> 01:17:14.596
INFORMATION FROM TECHNO SILVA

01:17:14.663 --> 01:17:17.132
OR ARE YOU ARE SO WE ARE WE ARE

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:19.368
FOR- FOR PRIDE PRIORITIZING BY

01:17:19.434 --> 01:17:21.470
OUR WILD FIRE RISK AREAS BY THE

01:17:21.536 --> 01:17:23.071
POPULATIONS WITHIN THOSE WILD

01:17:23.138 --> 01:17:24.539
FIRE RISK AREAS WE'RE

01:17:24.606 --> 01:17:27.576
INCORPORATING AS YOU MENTIONED

01:17:27.642 --> 01:17:28.176
THE TECHNO SILVA TECHNOLOGY.

01:17:28.243 --> 01:17:30.278
INTO OUR METEOROLOGY FOR OF

01:17:30.345 --> 01:17:32.214
CASTLE IT'S NOT JUST WHAT'S THE

01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.149
WEATHER IMPACTS THAT ARE COMING

01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:35.017
IN BUT ALSO WHAT IS THE

01:17:35.083 --> 01:17:36.251
POTENTIAL FOR THE WILDFIRE

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:38.186
SPREAD THAT CAN OCCUR WITH THAT

01:17:38.253 --> 01:17:39.187
AND THAT'S THE TECHNO SILVA

01:17:39.254 --> 01:17:41.223
PEACE. SO WE'RE WE'RE TAKING

01:17:41.289 --> 01:17:42.324
ALL OF THOSE PIECES WITH A RISK

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:45.060
BASED VIEW. TO UNDERSTAND WHERE

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:47.229
WE SHOULD BE APPLYING. OUR

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:50.799
MEDICATIONS. SO ARE YOU- AND I

01:17:50.866 --> 01:17:52.100
GUESS AND IS THE FOLLOW UP TO

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:54.069
THAT AND THAT'S THE- YOU'RE

01:17:54.136 --> 01:17:56.171
CREATING- THESE SWITCHING

01:17:56.238 --> 01:17:58.407
DEVICES OR SORT SECTION. I'M

01:17:58.473 --> 01:18:00.275
QUITE A MEMBER EXACT TERM USED.

01:18:00.342 --> 01:18:01.510
AND THE SECTIONAL I THINK THIS

01:18:01.576 --> 01:18:04.046
ACTUALIZING SO. TO BE ABLE TO

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:06.581
REALLY DRILL DOWN AND CUT OFF

01:18:06.648 --> 01:18:08.350
ONLY THOSE AREAS IT ABSOLUTELY

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:10.652
NEED THAT. SO I THOUGHT THAT

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:12.320
TECHNOLOGY EGGS EXISTED ALREADY

01:18:12.387 --> 01:18:13.822
SO I'M KIND OF SURPRISED THAT

01:18:13.889 --> 01:18:15.924
WERE IN TWENTY TWENTY AND- WE

01:18:15.991 --> 01:18:17.926
CAN'T REALLY SECTION ALLIES THE

01:18:17.993 --> 01:18:21.530
GRID LIKE THAT SO- IS THAT THE

01:18:21.596 --> 01:18:23.565
SAME AND THE OTHER TWO. UTILITY

01:18:23.632 --> 01:18:25.200
ATLANTIC I SAW ALL SPEAK RIGHT

01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:27.069
HERE IT REALLY TAKES THE

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:27.536
UNDERSTANDING OF THE

01:18:27.602 --> 01:18:29.104
ENVIRONMENT THE WEATHER. IN

01:18:29.171 --> 01:18:30.705
CONJUNCTION WITH THE SWITCHING

01:18:30.772 --> 01:18:31.873
DEVICE THAT ALLOWS YOU TO BE

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:33.608
THAT PRECISE SO YOU- BY

01:18:33.675 --> 01:18:34.943
INSTALLING THE WEATHER STATIONS

01:18:35.010 --> 01:18:36.111
EARLY IN GETTING THE TEN YEAR

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:37.813
HISTORY THAT WE HAVE. WE

01:18:37.879 --> 01:18:39.714
UNDERSTAND THIS SMALL SEGMENT

01:18:39.781 --> 01:18:40.482
THAT AFFECTS YOU KNOW JUST THIS

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:41.917
HUNDRED CUSTOMERS WHAT THE

01:18:41.983 --> 01:18:42.818
WEATHER ENVIRONMENT IN

01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:44.753
CONDITIONS ARE THERE AND THEN.

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:45.987
ONCE WE GET INTO AN OPERATIONAL

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:47.656
SITUATION WE LOOK AT THE

01:18:47.722 --> 01:18:48.957
CONDITIONS AND ARE ABLE TO MAKE

01:18:49.024 --> 01:18:50.859
A REAL TIME DECISION AND OPEN

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:51.593
THAT SECTION LIES IN THE VICE

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:53.061
THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

01:18:53.128 --> 01:18:54.563
WEATHER STATION. THUS ISOLATING

01:18:54.629 --> 01:18:56.331
THAT AREA. YOU HAVE A TEN YEAR

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:58.934
HISTORY YOU DON'T SO HOW IS

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.336
THIS GOING TO MAKE US SAFER AND

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:02.971
THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. SO FIRST

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:05.006
WE'VE BEEN BENCHMARKING WITH

01:19:05.073 --> 01:19:06.308
BOTH OF THE OTHER UTILITIES AND

01:19:06.374 --> 01:19:08.677
STEALING SHAMELESS FROM BOTH OF

01:19:08.743 --> 01:19:09.945
THEM TELL YOU THAT WE'RE

01:19:10.011 --> 01:19:12.347
WORKING TO MAKE OUR- OUR

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:18.520
EVENTS. SMARTER SHORTER AND

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:19.721
IS. IN THE WEATHER FORECASTING

01:19:19.788 --> 01:19:21.123
AND THE TECHNO SILVA

01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:22.791
TECHNOLOGIES SO WE'RE TAKING

01:19:22.858 --> 01:19:23.925
OUR WEATHER FORECAST IF YOU

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:26.528
IMAGINE OUR SERVICE TERRITORY

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:28.063
SEVENTY THOUSAND SQUARE MILES.

01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:31.066
AND YOU YOU BREAK IT DOWN AND

01:19:31.133 --> 01:19:32.467
THE PIXELS. LAST YEAR OUR

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:34.970
CAPABILITY WAS TO FORECAST

01:19:35.036 --> 01:19:37.839
WEATHER IN THREE COLLAMER BY

01:19:37.906 --> 01:19:40.408
THREE KILOMETER PIXELS. THIS

01:19:40.475 --> 01:19:42.377
YEAR WE'RE REDUCING THAT WE'RE

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:44.212
SHRINKING THAT TO BUY TEN

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:46.014
CLIMBERS SO- OUR WEATHER

01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:48.016
FORECASTING COMBINED WITH THE

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:50.018
WILDFIRE SPREAD IS GOING TO

01:19:50.085 --> 01:19:51.586
GIVE US MUCH BETTER-

01:19:51.653 --> 01:19:53.555
UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THE AND

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:56.091
WHETHER IMPACTS WILL HIT. THEN

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:57.726
WITH THE ADDITIONAL SECTIONAL

01:19:57.792 --> 01:20:00.996
ISING DEVICES WE ARE ABLE TO

01:20:01.062 --> 01:20:03.899
ONLY ISOLATE THE FOLKS WHO ARE

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:06.001
IN THE AREA OF THE SEVERE

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:07.836
WEATHER SO THAT'S GONNA MAKE

01:20:07.903 --> 01:20:11.540
THE EVENTS MUCH SMALLER THEN-

01:20:11.606 --> 01:20:12.574
WE'RE WE'VE BROUGHT ON

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:14.476
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WE HAVE

01:20:14.543 --> 01:20:16.011
CONTRACTED HELICOPTERS WERE

01:20:16.077 --> 01:20:18.079
NEARLY DOUBLING OUR HELICOPTER

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:20.549
RESOURCES TO FLY THE LINES TO

01:20:20.615 --> 01:20:22.417
ENSURE THERE'S NO DEBRIS IN

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:23.752
THEM. BEFORE WE RE ENERGIZE

01:20:23.818 --> 01:20:25.287
THOSE LINES WERE ALSO BRINGING

01:20:25.353 --> 01:20:27.088
IN SOME FIXED WING AIRCRAFT TO

01:20:27.155 --> 01:20:28.089
BE ABLE TO PERFORM NIGHT

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:29.858
PATROLS FOR OUR TRANSMISSION

01:20:29.925 --> 01:20:32.227
LINES SO THAT WE CAN RESTORE

01:20:32.294 --> 01:20:34.129
CUSTOMERS EVEN FASTER AND WE'RE

01:20:34.196 --> 01:20:35.263
LOOKING TO MOVE THOSE RIGHT

01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:37.265
RESTORATION TIMES FROM TWENTY

01:20:37.332 --> 01:20:39.234
FOUR HOURS AFTER THE WIND EVENT

01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:41.536
ENDS TO TWELVE HOURS. DAHLE

01:20:41.603 --> 01:20:43.205
YOU'D LIKE THAT I MENTIONED

01:20:43.271 --> 01:20:44.940
EARLIER IN THE DISCUSSION OF

01:20:45.006 --> 01:20:46.808
OUR INVESTMENT TRAJECTORY OVER

01:20:46.875 --> 01:20:48.944
THE LAST. DECADE OR SO OF

01:20:49.010 --> 01:20:50.512
ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. A BIG

01:20:50.579 --> 01:20:51.813
PART OF THAT WAS THE SECTIONAL

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:52.881
RISING WAS PART OF OUR GREAT

01:20:52.948 --> 01:20:55.283
MODERNIZATION PROGRAM- THEY ON

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:56.685
AVERAGE WE HAVE FOUR DEVICES

01:20:56.751 --> 01:20:58.520
SECTION LIGHTING DEVICES- PER

01:20:58.587 --> 01:21:00.422
CIRCUIT- SO THAT'S SOMETHING

01:21:00.488 --> 01:21:01.723
WE'RE EXPLOITING EVEN MORE NOW

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:03.758
WE DIDN'T LAST WILDFIRE SEASON

01:21:03.825 --> 01:21:06.528
LAST PSP IS EVENT- SEASON. ONE

01:21:06.595 --> 01:21:07.495
OF THESE WERE ALSO BUILDING

01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:09.130
INTO THE PROGRAM AND IT WILL

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:10.365
PROBABLY COME UP A LITTLE BIT

01:21:10.432 --> 01:21:11.233
LATER DURING THE PS PS

01:21:11.299 --> 01:21:12.801
DISCUSSION. UP IS ACTUALLY

01:21:12.867 --> 01:21:14.669
BUILDING EFFECTIVELY AND WHAT

01:21:14.736 --> 01:21:15.937
IS A PLAYBOOK FOR EVERY SINGLE

01:21:16.004 --> 01:21:17.505
CIRCUIT SO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

01:21:17.572 --> 01:21:18.907
YOU GET IN THESE EVENTS YOU

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:19.708
DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE COMING

01:21:19.774 --> 01:21:21.843
FROM YOU MAY HAVE- NGUYEN FROM

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:22.377
ONE DIRECTION TO ANOTHER

01:21:22.444 --> 01:21:23.878
DIRECTION A CERTAIN. PORTION OF

01:21:23.945 --> 01:21:25.747
THE CIRCUIT- RECEIVING THE HIGH

01:21:25.814 --> 01:21:27.582
WINDS ANOTHER BUT PORTION NOT

01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:28.883
SO OR DOING FOR BREAKING EACH

01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:30.151
ONE DOWN SAYING IN THIS

01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:31.753
SITUATION. THIS IS HOW YOU

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:33.855
SEXUAL LIFE THE CIRCUIT SO.

01:21:33.922 --> 01:21:35.690
INSTEAD OF IN THE EVENT.

01:21:35.757 --> 01:21:37.359
ASSESSING THE SITUATION AND

01:21:37.425 --> 01:21:38.159
COMING UP WITHA PLAN WE'RE

01:21:38.226 --> 01:21:39.628
GONNA MULTIPLE PLANS GOING INTO

01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:41.596
THE SCENARIO SO WE CAN SECTION

01:21:41.663 --> 01:21:43.098
LIES MUCH MORE EFFECTIVELY AND

01:21:43.164 --> 01:21:44.432
WE SEE THAT THAT MAKES A HUGE

01:21:44.499 --> 01:21:46.401
DIFFERENCE- IT'S- IT'S UP TO

01:21:46.468 --> 01:21:47.769
HALF THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS ON

01:21:47.836 --> 01:21:49.971
ANY GIVEN CIRCUIT. OR MORE TO

01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:51.273
BANG ON HOW MUCH. HOW MUCH

01:21:51.339 --> 01:21:53.608
YOU'RE ABLE TO- TO PARSE THAT

01:21:53.675 --> 01:21:55.944
OUT IN BIG EVENTS CANDIDLY BIG

01:21:56.011 --> 01:21:56.845
EVENTS TAKE. MY MORE OF THE

01:21:56.911 --> 01:21:59.748
CIRCUIT WITHIN THEM SO. REDUCE

01:21:59.814 --> 01:22:02.217
OPPORTUNITY FOR TWICE BUT THAT

01:22:02.284 --> 01:22:08.189
WOULD. OKAY THIS MESSAGE. THANK

01:22:08.256 --> 01:22:09.791
YOU I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:10.992
MISTER WOULD SAY QUESTION TO P.

01:22:11.059 --> 01:22:12.894
JEANNIE AND ADDISON WITH SIR

01:22:12.961 --> 01:22:15.697
MIGHT ADD HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:17.899
TH WILD FIRE MITIGATION

01:22:17.966 --> 01:22:20.735
INVESTMENTS AB SO- A VERY VERY

01:22:20.802 --> 01:22:23.605
SIMILAR STORY- WE'RE USING A

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:24.906
KIND OF A PRECURSOR TO TECHNO

01:22:24.973 --> 01:22:25.507
SILVA WE WILL BE WITH ACT OF

01:22:25.573 --> 01:22:27.676
CIVIL AS WELL CALL REACTS- IT

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:30.312
ASSESSES A NUMBER OF DIMENSIONS

01:22:30.378 --> 01:22:30.912
INCLUDING POPULATION

01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:34.449
STRUCTURES- PROPENSITY TO

01:22:34.516 --> 01:22:35.016
SPREAD WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:36.785
DOES SPREAD. THEN WE MARRY THAT

01:22:36.851 --> 01:22:38.420
UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WE'VE

01:22:38.486 --> 01:22:39.621
DONE BILL TO THE MACHINE

01:22:39.688 --> 01:22:41.189
LEARNING CAPABILITY LURKING

01:22:41.256 --> 01:22:43.191
LOOKING AT ALL OF OUR DEVICES

01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:45.026
AND PIECES OF EQUIPMENT SO WHAT

01:22:45.093 --> 01:22:45.960
WE DO IS WE COMBINE A

01:22:46.027 --> 01:22:47.896
PROBABILITY OF FAILURE WITH THE

01:22:47.962 --> 01:22:49.864
CONSEQUENCE OF THAT FAILURE AND

01:22:49.931 --> 01:22:51.099
WE GET A SCORE AND WE LOOK AT

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:53.635
THAT AND BY THE WAY THIS IS ONE

01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:54.602
OF DIMENSIONS WE USE WE'RE ALSO

01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:56.104
LOOKING AT HOW OFTEN WAS A

01:22:56.171 --> 01:22:58.873
CUSTOMER IMPACTED BY P. S. P.

01:22:58.940 --> 01:22:59.941
S. IS THE MATH IS GREAT IT

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:01.309
HELPS US. BUT WE HAVE TO BRING

01:23:01.376 --> 01:23:02.310
SOME COMMON SENSE OF THESE

01:23:02.377 --> 01:23:03.912
DECISIONS AS WELL SO WE'RE

01:23:03.978 --> 01:23:05.547
MARRYING I'D SAY COMPLEX

01:23:05.613 --> 01:23:07.749
ANALYTIC TOOLS WITH COMMON AN

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:11.519
OPERATING HISTORY. TO

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:12.153
PRIORITIZE OUR INVESTMENTS OVER

01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:14.823
TIME. ALL RIGHT. I'D LIKE TO A

01:23:14.889 --> 01:23:16.725
GOD TURNED TO P. GINNY AND ASK

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:19.694
YOU A COUPLE QUESTIONS RELATED

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:22.897
TO. THE WILD FIRE SAFETY

01:23:22.964 --> 01:23:26.134
MITIGATION- INVESTMENTS FIRST

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:31.606
OF ALL I I'M NOT TO. FAMILIAR

01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:34.976
WITH HOW. YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:37.078
REVENUES THAT ARE COLLECTED

01:23:37.145 --> 01:23:38.847
FROM RATE PAYERS SPECIFICALLY

01:23:38.913 --> 01:23:40.782
FOR WILD FIRE MITIGATION

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:43.151
INVESTMENTS EIGHT DO YOU HAVE A

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:44.386
SEPARATE ACCOUNTING CAN YOU

01:23:44.452 --> 01:23:47.021
POINT LIKE ON A SPREADSHEET TO

01:23:47.088 --> 01:23:49.324
HOW MUCH- REVENUES ARE

01:23:49.391 --> 01:23:51.092
COLLECTED FROM P. JEANNIE RATE

01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:54.329
PAYERS FOR WHAT FAR MITIGATION

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:57.298
ON VESTMENTS. SO BUT NOT

01:23:57.365 --> 01:23:59.534
REALLY- AS PART OF OUR-

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:01.102
REGULATORY SCHEME WE HAVE RATE

01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:03.037
CASES ARE GENERAL RATE CASE THE

01:24:03.104 --> 01:24:04.672
BULK OF OUR WILDFIRE PROGRAMS

01:24:04.739 --> 01:24:05.707
HAVE BEEN REFLECTED OUR GENERAL

01:24:05.774 --> 01:24:08.176
RATE CASE. THAT AGGREGATES UP A

01:24:08.243 --> 01:24:09.944
REVENUE RICARDO REQUIREMENT

01:24:10.011 --> 01:24:12.747
THAT TURNS INTO- RATES SO WE

01:24:12.814 --> 01:24:14.716
CAN WE HAVE OF COURSE SEPARATE

01:24:14.783 --> 01:24:15.984
ACCOUNTING SO WE KNOW WHAT WE

01:24:16.050 --> 01:24:17.218
SPENT ON DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES

01:24:17.285 --> 01:24:18.186
INCLUDING A WILDFIRE

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:20.922
ACTIVITIES- BUT AND SO THERE'S

01:24:20.989 --> 01:24:22.757
WAYS TO ESTIMATE. HOW MUCH OF

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:24.192
OUR RATES THAT MIGHT BE OR A

01:24:24.259 --> 01:24:25.593
PERCENTAGE BUT IT'S NOT A

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:27.362
DIRECT ONE FOR ONE OKAY SO IN

01:24:27.429 --> 01:24:30.198
OTHER WORDS- WHEN THE CONCERN

01:24:30.265 --> 01:24:32.300
WAS RAISED EARLIER ABOUT. ALVY

01:24:32.367 --> 01:24:34.502
WHAT FOR MITIGATION INVESTMENTS

01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:35.403
ARE LIKELY TO LEAD TO HIGHER

01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:39.707
ON- RATES FOR CUSTOMERS.

01:24:39.774 --> 01:24:42.877
THERE'S NO WAY TO. BREAK DOWN

01:24:42.944 --> 01:24:45.547
AND WHAT. PORTION OF THE HIGHER

01:24:45.613 --> 01:24:47.515
RATES ARE GOING TOWARD WILD

01:24:47.582 --> 01:24:49.684
FIRE MITIGATION INVESTMENTS.

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:51.753
NOT DIRECTLY THERE'D RULES OF

DOES NOT. STRAIGHT FORWARD OKAY

01:24:58.793 --> 01:25:05.967
ARM IN TERMS OF THE. OKAY SO-

01:25:06.034 --> 01:25:07.135
SO BECAUSE THERE'S NO

01:25:07.202 --> 01:25:09.137

01:25:09.204 --> 01:25:11.306
OVERSIGHT FROM THE PC IN TERMS

01:25:11.372 --> 01:25:15.677
OF. THE AMOUNT OF REVENUES WHAT

01:25:15.743 --> 01:25:17.846
WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT REVENUES-

01:25:17.912 --> 01:25:19.314
COLLECTED FROM RATE PAYERS ARE

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:20.815
GOING TOWARD WHAT FIRED

01:25:20.882 --> 01:25:22.484
PERCENTAGES AT AS YOU JUST

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:23.585
INDICATED AMENDED WE WERE

PERCENTAGE ESTIMATES SO- IN

01:25:27.355 --> 01:25:30.525
THIS SPACE THE CPUC REGULATES

01:25:30.592 --> 01:25:32.427
OUR MANAGES US ON WHAT WE SPEND

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:35.263
RIGHT SO THE REVENUE SIDE IS-

01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:39.033
SOMEWHAT. DISCONNECTED BUT OUR

TWENTY TWENTY GENERAL RATE CASE

01:25:39.734 --> 01:25:42.103
WHICH IS BEING- MANAGED THROUGH

CERTAIN PROPOSED CAP AND IF WE

01:25:54.382 --> 01:25:55.550
HAVE TO SPEND MORE THAN THAT

01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:57.418
THERE'S- A IT KICKS IN

SPENDING IT PRUDENTLY AND

01:26:02.023 --> 01:26:03.825
THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO BALL

01:26:03.892 --> 01:26:05.059
FOR VEGETATION MANAGEMENT AS

01:26:05.126 --> 01:26:06.628
WELL AS THE SYSTEM HARDENING

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:09.264

TO GET A GOOD ESTIMATE THAT.

01:26:49.103 --> 01:26:52.974
ARI BUT AS OF NOW IN TERMS OF

PUTTING INTO OUR PLANS IN ORDER

01:27:24.138 --> 01:27:25.840
TO ADDRESS THE WILD FIRE

01:27:25.907 --> 01:27:27.475
MITIGATION IT'S REALLY THE

01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:29.110
FOCUS IS NOT ON THE FENCE

ELECTRICITY RATES AND SO WELL

01:27:46.127 --> 01:27:48.396
AS- YOU'RE TELLING US TO

01:27:48.463 --> 01:27:50.565
EXPECT- EVEN HIGHER RATES WITH

01:27:50.632 --> 01:27:54.268
THE WITH THE GREATER- AND NEED

01:27:54.335 --> 01:27:55.670

01:27:55.737 --> 01:27:57.772
INVESTMENTS IN A WORK AYE. I

01:27:57.839 --> 01:27:59.874

HIGHER AND HOW MUCH OF THAT IS

01:28:19.627 --> 01:28:20.962
DUE TO THE WATER FOR MEDICATION

01:28:21.029 --> 01:28:23.031
INVESTMENTS RIGHT RIGHT I THINK

01:28:23.097 --> 01:28:25.066

THE EXTENT THAT THAT FLOWS TO

01:28:52.460 --> 01:28:54.729
THE REVENUE SIDE BOB THAT'S DID

01:28:54.796 --> 01:28:55.763

01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:31.906
THEY MAY EXPERIENCE A PUBLIC

01:33:31.973 --> 01:33:34.108
SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF- THEN AS

01:33:34.175 --> 01:33:35.910
WE GET INTO REAL TIME- WE

01:33:35.977 --> 01:33:37.611
MONITOR THE EVENTS CLOSELY.

01:33:37.678 --> 01:33:39.981
STATION BY STATION. LOOK AT THE

01:33:40.047 --> 01:33:41.248
WEATHER EVENTS FROM THAT

01:33:41.315 --> 01:33:42.483
WEATHER STATION AS SOON AS THEY

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:44.018
GET ABOVE A THRESHOLD REFILL

01:33:44.085 --> 01:33:45.286
THE RISK IS TOO GREAT TO LEAVE

01:33:45.353 --> 01:33:47.321
THE INFRASTRUCTURE ENERGIZED-

01:33:47.388 --> 01:33:48.656
WE MAKE A DECISION TO SHUT OFF

01:33:48.723 --> 01:33:50.024
THAT PARTICULAR SEGMENT SO

01:33:50.091 --> 01:33:51.425
THERE WERE EIGHTY FOUR SEPARATE

01:33:51.492 --> 01:33:54.061
DECISIONS. AT DIFFERENT TIMES-

01:33:54.128 --> 01:33:55.262
THAT AVERAGES AROUND THREE IN

01:33:55.329 --> 01:33:57.398
AND FOR CUSTOMERS A DECISION.

01:33:57.465 --> 01:33:59.867
TO ULTIMATELY GET TO THAT

01:33:59.934 --> 01:34:00.434
TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN

01:34:00.501 --> 01:34:01.035
HUNDRED AND THAT'S- THAT'S A

01:34:01.102 --> 01:34:02.269
WAY FOR US TO ONLY IMPACT THE

01:34:02.336 --> 01:34:03.471
CUSTOMERS THAT NEED TO BE

01:34:03.537 --> 01:34:04.839
IMPACTED ALSO IT'S A WAY FOR US

01:34:04.905 --> 01:34:07.675
TO. MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING IT IN

01:34:07.742 --> 01:34:08.175
A SHORT OF ADORATION AS

01:34:08.242 --> 01:34:11.245
POSSIBLE. AND JUST THE SAME AS

01:34:11.312 --> 01:34:12.380
WE DE ENERGIZED THEN WE USE THE

01:34:12.446 --> 01:34:14.382
SAME FORECAST IN AND-

01:34:14.448 --> 01:34:16.584
INFORMATION TO IDENTIFY AT WHAT

01:34:16.650 --> 01:34:17.518
TIME PERIODS IT'LL BE SAFE TO

01:34:17.585 --> 01:34:19.954
RE ENERGIZE THEM- WE HAVE. THE

BE PATROLLED BY FOOT- WE

01:34:27.061 --> 01:34:29.930
REQUIRE A FULL PATROL- BEFORE

01:34:29.997 --> 01:34:30.931
WE RE ENERGIZE SOMETHING WE

01:34:30.998 --> 01:34:32.466
ALSO HAVE CONTRACT FIREFIGHTING

01:34:32.533 --> 01:34:34.535

01:39:31.932 --> 01:39:33.834
TIME WE STOOD UP- WE HAVE A

01:39:33.901 --> 01:39:36.270
VERY SIMILAR PHILOSOPHY- AS- AS

01:39:36.337 --> 01:39:38.072
FAR AS- THE ENERGIES ATION-

01:39:38.138 --> 01:39:39.106
TYPICALLY AS I LOOK OVER THE

01:39:39.173 --> 01:39:41.875
ENTIRE. SPAN OF- PS PS EVENTS

01:39:41.942 --> 01:39:44.111
OVER THE YEAR- WE ROUGHLY DE

01:39:44.178 --> 01:39:46.413
ENERGIZED AROUND 10% OF THE

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:48.882
TIME WE NOTIFY SO WE HAVE A AND

01:39:48.949 --> 01:39:50.551
WE LEAN IN THE NOTIFICATIONS WE

01:39:50.617 --> 01:39:52.519
THINK EARLY WARNING PREPARATION

01:39:52.586 --> 01:39:54.254
IS A IS IMPORTANT. THE

01:39:54.321 --> 01:39:55.756
CONSEQUENCE OF THAT CAN BE

01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:56.790
NOTIFICATION FATIGUE SO WE'RE

01:39:56.857 --> 01:39:58.258
WELL AWARE OF THAT BUT WE THINK

01:39:58.325 --> 01:39:59.660
OF LETTING PEOPLE KNOW IS

01:39:59.727 --> 01:40:02.196
ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL- SO THE

01:40:02.262 --> 01:40:04.031
AND- WITH A WERE PRETTY GOOD AT

01:40:04.098 --> 01:40:07.334
THIS- MY SAID TEN PERCENT- IS

01:40:07.401 --> 01:40:09.103
PROBABLY ABOUT WHERE WE FEEL WE

01:40:09.169 --> 01:40:11.138
SHOULD BE RIGHT NOW- AGAIN I

01:40:11.205 --> 01:40:11.839
MENTION THE FIVE MILLION

01:40:11.905 --> 01:40:14.074
CUSTOMERS- METERED ACCOUNTS-

01:40:14.141 --> 01:40:16.009
RELATIVE TO THE WORST- WORST

01:40:16.076 --> 01:40:17.578
EVENT WE HAD WITH A HUNDRED

01:40:17.644 --> 01:40:19.012
THOUSAND DE ENERGIZED. IT'S

01:40:19.079 --> 01:40:21.882
ABOUT 2% OF OUR CUSTOMERS- BUT

01:40:21.949 --> 01:40:25.252
THAT DOESN'T MEAN A LOT TO YOU

01:40:25.319 --> 01:40:26.653
KNOW THAT ARE OUR SECTIONAL

01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:28.689
RISING ABILITY IS GREAT WHEN WE

01:40:28.756 --> 01:40:30.157
ARE. REMAIN ENERGIZED BUT IF

01:40:30.224 --> 01:40:32.259
YOU'RE NOT- NOT SO GREAT SO

01:40:32.326 --> 01:40:33.160
THAT'S THE AREA WE'RE SPENDING

01:40:33.227 --> 01:40:36.897
A LOT OF TIME. OF FOCUSING. I

01:40:36.964 --> 01:40:37.965
HAVE TO SAY IN AND ONE IN FOR

01:40:38.031 --> 01:40:39.400
SO. THIS I IN OUR POST. AND WE

01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:41.568
ALSO WILL NOT RE ENERGIZE UNTIL

01:40:41.635 --> 01:40:44.438
WE- DO A PATROL OF OUR LINES.

01:40:44.505 --> 01:40:47.307
WHERE ARE- CRUZ FEEL CREWS HAVE

01:40:47.374 --> 01:40:48.809
EYES ON THE EQUIPMENT. IT'S

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:49.810
VERY IMPORTANT WE CAN'T DO THIS

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:51.478
REMOTELY. WE HAVE TO BE THERE

01:40:51.545 --> 01:40:53.046
TO SEE WHAT'S OUT THERE. AND

01:40:53.113 --> 01:40:54.181
WHEN WE DID THIS WE FOUND FORTY

01:40:54.248 --> 01:40:56.049
INSTANCES. OF DAMAGE TO OUR

01:40:56.116 --> 01:40:57.718
LINES OR VEGETATION ON THOSE

01:40:57.785 --> 01:40:59.153
LINES THAT WE FEEL COULD HAVE

01:40:59.219 --> 01:41:00.854
CAUSED. A CATASTROPHIC

01:41:00.921 --> 01:41:03.023
WILDFIRES. IN IT DID NOT. DID

01:41:03.090 --> 01:41:04.758
NOT BECAUSE WE DE ENERGIZED AND

01:41:04.825 --> 01:41:05.926
THAT'S WHY THIS NEEDS TO.

01:41:05.993 --> 01:41:07.761
REMAIN A KEY PART OF OUR OUR

01:41:07.828 --> 01:41:11.465
ARSENAL HERE. NOW AGAIN THIS IS

01:41:11.532 --> 01:41:12.566
IMPORTANT IT'S IMPORTANT PART

01:41:12.633 --> 01:41:14.234
OF OUR- ARE- MITIGATION

01:41:14.301 --> 01:41:17.004
EFFORTS- BUT THE MORE OF OUR

01:41:17.070 --> 01:41:17.538
MITIGATION EFFORTS WE JUST

01:41:17.604 --> 01:41:18.505
TALKED ABOUT EARLIER COVER

01:41:18.572 --> 01:41:20.107
CONDUCTOR- THE MORE SECTIONAL

01:41:20.174 --> 01:41:21.208
RISING THE ADVANCE WEATHER

01:41:21.275 --> 01:41:23.677
STATIONS- THE LESS. IMPORTANT

01:41:23.744 --> 01:41:25.946
THAT THIS PARTICULAR TOOL HAS-

01:41:26.013 --> 01:41:27.347
IN IN THE WAY WE MITIGATE

01:41:27.414 --> 01:41:29.950
WILDFIRE RISK. WE ALSO HAVE

01:41:30.017 --> 01:41:31.718
PARTNERED WITH OUR COMMUNITIES

01:41:31.785 --> 01:41:33.654
OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. NOW WE

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:34.621
HAVE TO DEAL WITH FIFTEEN

01:41:34.688 --> 01:41:36.356
COUNTIES AND SO EACH ONE OF

01:41:36.423 --> 01:41:37.858
THOSE HAS- THEIR OWN FIRST

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:39.493
RESPONDER TEAMS. AS WELL AS CAL

01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:40.961
FIRE SO IT'S A PRETTY BIG FOOT

01:41:41.028 --> 01:41:43.464
PRINT. OF FIRST RESPONDERS IN

01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:45.199
COMMUNITIES WE DEAL WITH BUT WE

01:41:45.265 --> 01:41:46.600
DO WE ENGAGE WITH THEM VERY

01:41:46.667 --> 01:41:48.302
ACTIVELY- WERE OUT IN THE

01:41:48.368 --> 01:41:49.536
COMMUNITY BEFORE EVENTS AND

01:41:49.603 --> 01:41:51.138
AFTER EVENTS. AND I DO HAVE

01:41:51.205 --> 01:41:54.274
BEEN- IN- IN THOSE AREAS AFTER

01:41:54.341 --> 01:41:55.642
A LEADING UP TO EVENTS SO I

01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:56.577
UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE

01:41:56.643 --> 01:41:57.978
CONCERNS. OF MANY OF THE

01:41:58.045 --> 01:41:59.213
CONCERNS AND WE'RE GOING TO

01:41:59.279 --> 01:42:01.715
ADDRESS THOSE. NOW WE HAVE A

01:42:01.782 --> 01:42:03.884
SIMILAR- KIND OF RUN UP- BASED

01:42:03.951 --> 01:42:06.220
ON WHETHER- IT'S- ROUGHLY THREE

01:42:06.286 --> 01:42:07.754
DAYS BEFORE AN EVENT. HOW WE

01:42:07.821 --> 01:42:08.755
SEE IT COMING THAT'S WILL

01:42:08.822 --> 01:42:10.624
NOTIFY- OR FIRST RESPONDER

01:42:10.691 --> 01:42:11.625
PARTNERS AND- GOVERNMENT

01:42:11.692 --> 01:42:13.660
AGENCIES. OTHER CRITICAL-

01:42:13.727 --> 01:42:15.429
INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDERS-

01:42:15.496 --> 01:42:16.763
AROUND FORTY EIGHT HOURS IN

01:42:16.830 --> 01:42:18.866
ADVANCE OF THE VENT IF WE HAVE

01:42:18.932 --> 01:42:19.399
THE WEATHER FORECASTS TO

01:42:19.466 --> 01:42:20.968
DEMONSTRATE IT WILL ALSO NOTIFY

01:42:21.034 --> 01:42:23.871
CUSTOMERS- AGAIN THIS IS THIS

01:42:23.937 --> 01:42:26.106
IS THE WEATHER- OUR TOOLS ARE

01:42:26.173 --> 01:42:28.342
ARE VERY GOOD. WE BELIEVE UP

01:42:28.408 --> 01:42:29.076
BUT IT'S THE WEATHER AND SO

01:42:29.142 --> 01:42:32.246
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN YOU DON'T

01:42:32.312 --> 01:42:32.746
HAVE A FORTY EIGHT HOUR

01:42:32.813 --> 01:42:33.413
NOTIFICATION. AND WE UNDERSTAND

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.281
THEY CAN BE VERY CHALLENGING TO

01:42:34.348 --> 01:42:37.651
OUR OUR CUSTOMERS- BUT ALL THIS

01:42:37.718 --> 01:42:38.719
INFORMATION HELPS US TO MAKE

01:42:38.785 --> 01:42:39.853
THE KIND OF DECISIONS WE THINK

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:41.655
WE NEED TO MAKE IN THE INTEREST

01:42:41.722 --> 01:42:43.924
OF PUBLIC SAFETY. NOW WE DID

01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:45.325
LOOK AT LESSONS OR AND I SHOULD

01:42:45.392 --> 01:42:47.060
SAY WE LOOK AT OCTOBER BUT THE

01:42:47.127 --> 01:42:48.996
REAL TRUTH OF THIS IS. EVERY

01:42:49.062 --> 01:42:50.664
SINGLE EVENT THAT WE GO THROUGH

01:42:50.731 --> 01:42:52.332
IS A LESSONS LEARNED

01:42:52.399 --> 01:42:54.434
OPPORTUNITY. AND EACH EVENT

01:42:54.501 --> 01:42:55.602
WHETHER IT'S A SMALL THEN

01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:57.371
WITHOUT ANYBODY DE ENERGIZED.

01:42:57.437 --> 01:43:00.641
OR A BIG EVENT- WE LEARN. AND

01:43:00.707 --> 01:43:01.475
SOME OTHER THINGS THAT WERE

01:43:01.542 --> 01:43:03.510
BRING TO FOR- WE KNOW THAT

01:43:03.577 --> 01:43:05.145
DURING THESE EVENTS ARE WEBSITE

01:43:05.212 --> 01:43:06.513
COULD NOT HANDLE THE TRAFFIC WE

01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:07.948
FIX THAT. WE'VE UPGRADED OUR

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:09.049
SERVERS AND WE CAN HANDLE THE

01:43:09.116 --> 01:43:10.884
TRAFFIC. AND WE'VE TESTED UNDER

01:43:10.951 --> 01:43:12.119
THE MOST EXTREME MODELED

01:43:12.185 --> 01:43:14.488
CIRCUMSTANCE SO WE FIX THAT.

01:43:14.555 --> 01:43:15.923
ANOTHER BIG AREA WAS OUR

01:43:15.989 --> 01:43:18.025
CIRCUIT MAPS SO- WE PUT CIRCUIT

01:43:18.091 --> 01:43:19.993
MAPS UP AND- WE FOUND THAT MOST

01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:21.995
CUSTOMERS DID NOT SEE A LOT OF

01:43:22.062 --> 01:43:23.263

IDENTIFY CIRCUITS THAT ARE

01:45:46.339 --> 01:45:47.808
FREQUENTLY MORE OFTEN THAN

01:45:47.874 --> 01:45:49.142
OTHERS DE ENERGIZED. SO WE'RE

01:45:49.209 --> 01:45:50.644
TARGETING THOSE FOR EXPEDITED.

01:45:50.711 --> 01:45:52.646
COVERING OF THE CONDUCTOR OR

01:45:52.713 --> 01:45:53.547
OTHER ENGINEERING FIXES IT

01:45:53.613 --> 01:45:55.482
COULD BE A SWITCH- IT COULD BE

01:45:55.549 --> 01:45:56.683
A PEACE UNDERGROUND AND-

01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:57.951
THERE'S OTHER THINGS WE CAN DO

01:45:58.018 --> 01:45:58.852
OUTSIDE OF COVERING AND WE'RE

01:45:58.919 --> 01:46:00.754
LOOKING TO DO THOSE. TO REDUCE

01:46:00.821 --> 01:46:03.623
THE IMPACT OF THE SPS- DETAILED

01:46:03.690 --> 01:46:04.424
ENGINEERING SYSTEM OF

01:46:04.491 --> 01:46:06.126
VALUATIONS WHAT WE CAN EVEN

01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:07.728
CONFIGURE CIRCUITS IN ADVANCE

01:46:07.794 --> 01:46:09.830
OF THE HIGH FIRE. RISK

01:46:09.896 --> 01:46:11.665
SOMETIMES CIRCUITS ARE SUPPLIED

01:46:11.732 --> 01:46:13.567
FOR RELIABILITY FROM ANOTHER

01:46:13.633 --> 01:46:15.502
SUBSTATION- BUT SOMETIMES WILL

01:46:15.569 --> 01:46:18.004
TAKE A RELIABILITY. IN GENERAL

01:46:18.071 --> 01:46:20.207
TO. PUT THEM THE CIRCUIT THAT

01:46:20.273 --> 01:46:21.141
BE BE MORE RESILIENT IN A WHILE

01:46:21.208 --> 01:46:23.243
FAR TO TUITION SO THESE ARE

01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:24.711
THINGS THAT HAVEN'T.

01:46:24.778 --> 01:46:27.214
HISTORICALLY DONE WILL DO THAT

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:31.551
NOW. OUT MY GRADES PENSION.

01:46:31.618 --> 01:46:35.522
EARLIER THE- OTHER KEY. THIS IS

01:46:35.589 --> 01:46:37.924
MY TO ALL THING. BUT WE LOOK

01:46:37.991 --> 01:46:40.160
JUST AT HE- SWITCHING PLAYBOOKS.

01:46:40.227 --> 01:46:41.495
AND WE DID A Mà. RELIES ON

01:46:41.561 --> 01:46:42.596
SAME FOR HAPPENED. YEAR THAT

01:46:42.662 --> 01:46:43.730
WOULD HAPPEN THIS YEAR SOME

01:46:43.797 --> 01:46:44.831
KIND OF A ALL THINGS BEING

01:46:44.898 --> 01:46:46.333
EQUAL- W FOUND THE JUSTICE

01:46:46.399 --> 01:46:48.401
SWITCHING PLAYBOOKS. COULD TO

01:46:48.468 --> 01:46:50.203
REDUCE THE IMPACT BY AT LEAST

01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:52.606
30% SO IT'S WE THINK THERE'S A

01:46:52.672 --> 01:46:53.840
LOT OF THE AREA FOR

01:46:53.907 --> 01:46:55.442
IMPROVEMENT. THERE ARE MOVING

01:46:55.509 --> 01:46:57.744
AGGRESSIVELY TO ACCOMPLISH. SO

01:46:57.811 --> 01:46:59.045
THAT THAT'S REALLY THE PREPARED

01:46:59.112 --> 01:47:00.313
STATEMENT OF WHAT HAVE WE TAKE

01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:03.250
THIS REALLY SERIOUSLY. AS A-

01:47:03.316 --> 01:47:04.718
ENERGY PROFESSIONAL FOR MOST OF

01:47:04.785 --> 01:47:06.486
MY CAREER- INCLUDING MY-

01:47:06.553 --> 01:47:08.488
MILITARY EXPERIENCE IS PROBABLY

01:47:08.555 --> 01:47:12.192
AROUND THIRTY FIVE YEARS- WE

01:47:12.259 --> 01:47:13.093
MEASURE OURSELVES HAVE

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:13.994
HISTORICALLY MEASURE OURSELVES

01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:15.595
BY RELIABILITY METRICS RIGHT.

01:47:15.662 --> 01:47:16.930
SOMETHING CALLED SADIE SYSTEM

01:47:16.997 --> 01:47:19.299
AVERAGE- INSTANT DURATION INDEX

01:47:19.366 --> 01:47:22.002
HOW OFTEN YOU ARE ONLINE HOW

01:47:22.068 --> 01:47:23.303
LITTLE TIME YOU SPEND. DE

01:47:23.370 --> 01:47:25.806
ENERGIZING CUSTOMER SO MAKING A

01:47:25.872 --> 01:47:27.073
DECISION TO DE ENERGIZE A

01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:28.675
CUSTOMER IT'S NOT HARD NOT

01:47:28.742 --> 01:47:30.377
HISTORICALLY IN OUR DNA. BUT

01:47:30.443 --> 01:47:32.212
PUBLIC SAFETY IS OUR NUMBER ONE

01:47:32.279 --> 01:47:33.046
OBJECTIVE AND THAT TRUMPS

01:47:33.113 --> 01:47:34.714
EVERYTHING. AND THAT'S WHY WE

01:47:34.781 --> 01:47:36.283

SPECIFICALLY SO THAT IT IS MORE

01:53:45.685 --> 01:53:48.821
OF A SURGICAL SHUT OFF AS

01:53:48.888 --> 01:53:49.389
OPPOSED TO JUST SHUTTING OFF

01:53:49.455 --> 01:53:52.058
THE GRID. IN SOME OF MY CITIES

01:53:52.125 --> 01:53:53.893
IT WENT FROM HIGH RISK ALL THE

01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:57.964
WAY DOWN TO DOWNTOWN WHERE. THE

01:53:58.031 --> 01:53:59.866
CABLES WERE UNDERGROUND SO

01:53:59.933 --> 01:54:02.001
THERE WASN'T ZERO RISK. WHAT

01:54:02.068 --> 01:54:03.503

NEED TO BE REACHING OUT MORE

01:54:16.616 --> 01:54:17.750
PROACTIVELY SO I THINK THAT'S

01:54:17.817 --> 01:54:19.018
PART OF THE BIG LESSONS LEARNED

01:54:19.085 --> 01:54:20.253

PRECISE OR GROUP MUELLER OR

01:54:34.934 --> 01:54:37.770
SURGICAL- BUT THIS THEME IS THE

01:54:37.837 --> 01:54:40.340
SAME WHICH IS- THESE CONDITIONS

01:54:40.406 --> 01:54:41.975

01:54:42.041 --> 01:54:43.443
OF OUR CIRCUITS ARE TENS OF

01:54:43.509 --> 01:54:46.646
MILES LONG- SO AS YOU CAN AND-

01:54:46.713 --> 01:54:49.916

PRETTY GOOD SHAPE THERE WITH AS

01:55:01.928 --> 01:55:03.763
A SAID AROUND FOUR PER CIRCUIT-

01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:05.131
BUT THEN MAKING DECISIONS

01:55:05.198 --> 01:55:06.466
AROUND THAT AND THAT'S WHERE I

01:55:06.532 --> 01:55:08.668

01:55:08.735 --> 01:55:10.036
FOR EACH OF OUR CIRCUITS IN

01:55:10.103 --> 01:55:11.604
HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS IN THERE'S

01:55:11.671 --> 01:55:13.740
OVER A THOUSAND OF THOSE- WE

01:55:13.806 --> 01:55:15.408
STARTED THIS YEAR. WITH THE

01:55:15.475 --> 01:55:16.809

CRACKED AND WE HAVE BEEN ON THE

01:55:38.865 --> 01:55:40.133
FEMA MODEL FOR MANY MANY YEARS

01:55:40.199 --> 01:55:41.434

MANAGEMENT TEAM AN INCIDENT

01:55:42.735 --> 01:55:46.105
COMMAND STRUCTURE- BUT WE HAD A

01:55:46.172 --> 01:55:47.573
OPERATING SYSTEM THAT WOULD

02:07:21.834 --> 02:07:25.004
ONE- IT HAS A LARGER IMPACT

02:07:25.070 --> 02:07:25.571
THAN THAT AND SO WE PUT IN

02:07:25.637 --> 02:07:27.306

THAT A WHOLE TRANSMISSION. THAT

02:07:40.953 --> 02:07:41.987
THE WHOLE SUBSTATION WOULD BE

02:07:42.054 --> 02:07:43.255
DOWN IF WE TAKE OUT CERTAIN

02:07:43.322 --> 02:07:45.357

WE'RE TAKING MANY ANGLES TO TRY

02:07:46.859 --> 02:07:48.927
