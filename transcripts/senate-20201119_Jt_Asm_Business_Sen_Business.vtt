THIRTY DAYS IS THE AVERAGE TIME

00:38:34.211 --> 00:38:36.747
DELAY FOR GETTING A LICENSE IN

00:38:36.814 --> 00:38:39.984

SUBSTANTIAL THAT RAIES. ISSUES

THAT THE- PATIENT IS IN A PLACE

00:41:31.355 --> 00:41:33.524
WHERE THEY CAN TALK TO ME ABOUT

00:41:33.591 --> 00:41:34.158
THEIR HEALTHCARE WITHOUT

00:41:34.225 --> 00:41:36.861
CONCERN OF. OTHERS OVER HEARING

00:41:36.927 --> 00:41:38.696
AS WELL AS IN A SAFE PLACE AND

00:41:38.762 --> 00:41:39.930
HAVE THEM CALL THE FATHER

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:43.067
DRIVING- HELP THEM BE FOR

00:41:43.133 --> 00:41:45.703
EXAMPLE IN A RESTAURANT OR A-

00:41:45.769 --> 00:41:47.204
YOU KNOW OF. A LARGE AREA WHERE

00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:48.906
THEY CAN GET INTERNET ACCESS

00:41:48.973 --> 00:41:49.673
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THEIR

00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:51.242
HEALTHCARE SO SORT OF THOSE

00:41:51.308 --> 00:41:52.810
PRIVACY ISSUES THAT WE REMIND

00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:57.948
PATIENTS ABOUT- BUT I'M NOT

00:41:58.015 --> 00:41:59.483
AWARE OF ANY- SIX. SAID BEAR

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:03.120
YOUR- TO TELL THE FOR PH. N.

00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:05.356
DASH THEN. A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

00:42:05.422 --> 00:42:06.790
WAY YOU SEE A AT THE- AND THEN

00:42:06.857 --> 00:42:07.992
YOU TO TELL THAT YOU. THOUGHT

OF- THAT ARE COMING TO THE FORE.

00:42:11.528 --> 00:42:17.601
CONVENIENCE EFFICIENCY- COST. I

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:18.769
DO THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:20.337
DEFINITE ADVANTAGES IN TERMS OF

00:42:20.404 --> 00:42:22.406
CONVENIENCE FOR THE PATIENT-

00:42:22.473 --> 00:42:23.807
FROMA MEDICAL PERSPECTIVE

00:42:23.874 --> 00:42:24.541
THERE ARE SOME PRETTY

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:26.277
SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS AND

00:42:26.343 --> 00:42:26.944
THAT I CAN'T DO A PHYSICAL

00:42:27.011 --> 00:42:30.147
EXAM- AND IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:32.016
TO GET- LABORATORY ANALYSIS OR

00:42:32.082 --> 00:42:33.784
OTHER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

00:42:33.851 --> 00:42:37.288
THAT AIDS IN THE DIAGNOSTICPROCESS- BUT I DO THINK THAT-

00:42:37.354 --> 00:42:39.156
PATIENTS- CERTAINLY- MY

00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:41.025
EXPERIENCE IS THAT THEY REALLY

00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:44.194
LIKE THEY ACCESS THAT'S THERE-

00:42:44.261 --> 00:42:46.530
IN AS WELL- YOU KNOW I LIKE TO

00:42:46.597 --> 00:42:47.798
BE ABLE TO TALK TO MY PATIENTS

00:42:47.865 --> 00:42:48.799
AND KIND OF SEE WHAT'S GOING ON

00:42:48.866 --> 00:42:50.301
WITH THEM IT CAN BE FRUSTRATING

00:42:50.367 --> 00:42:52.369
SOMETIMES. BECAUSE OF THAT JUST

00:42:52.436 --> 00:42:53.404
THE LIMITATIONS OF THE

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:55.472
TECHNOLOGY WHERE- YOU KNOW

00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:57.675
INFORMATION CUTS OUT- DIFFERENT

00:42:57.741 --> 00:42:59.209

CONFLICT THAT COMES INTO PLAY

01:32:13.327 --> 01:32:15.796
WOULD YOU SAY. AND ACTUALLY I

01:32:15.863 --> 01:32:17.865

SO EVEN IF THERE WAS A CHANGE

01:32:47.795 --> 01:32:48.829

THAT. THE FEES A LOT OF THIS

01:44:19.453 --> 01:44:20.887
WITH THE FEE INCREASES IS JUST

01:44:20.954 --> 01:44:23.523
THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS. AND

I HAD MENTIONED EARLIER IN MY

01:44:25.192 --> 01:44:27.060
TALKING POINTS THE ISSUE OF HOW

01:44:27.127 --> 01:44:30.364
IT HAS INCREASED- A BASED ON

01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:32.366
EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND THERE

01:44:32.432 --> 01:44:34.635
HAVE BEEN INCREASES AND- DOES

01:44:34.701 --> 01:44:36.470
IT OVER THE YEARS OVER THE LAST

01:44:36.536 --> 01:44:37.571
COUPLE OF YEARS AS TO WHERE YOU

01:44:37.638 --> 01:44:39.573

THOUSAND AND IN THOSE AREAS ALL

01:44:42.943 --> 01:44:43.944
THE WAY UP UNTIL PROBABLY

01:44:44.011 --> 01:44:46.413
ALMOST TWO THOUSAND. FOURTEEN

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:47.514
WE COULD NOT SEE THOSE EMPLOYEE

01:44:47.581 --> 01:44:49.282
COMPENSATION INCREASES AND SO

01:44:49.349 --> 01:44:51.718
THAT HAS REALLY IMPACTED- NOT

01:44:51.785 --> 01:44:54.054
JUST ONLY THAT HERO. BUT IT

01:44:54.121 --> 01:44:56.723
ALSO HAS IMPACTED I'M STATEWIDE

01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:58.492
EMPLOYEES SO YOU HAVE ALSO

01:44:58.558 --> 01:45:00.127
IMPACTED THE DEPARTMENT RIGHT

01:45:00.193 --> 01:45:02.262
THERE'S EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS-

01:45:02.329 --> 01:45:04.531
STATEWIDE. EMPLOYMENT AT

EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION INCREASES

01:45:14.908 --> 01:45:15.542
NOT ONLY IMPACT THAT THAT

01:45:15.609 --> 01:45:17.511
SPECIFIC VERO BUT THE IMPACT

01:45:17.577 --> 01:45:19.880
ALL THE WAY THROUGH- TO DISOBEY

01:45:19.946 --> 01:45:22.182
PROBLEMATIC. APPS AND STATE

01:45:22.249 --> 01:45:24.551
WIDE PROGRAM AT F. AND M. I

01:45:24.618 --> 01:45:26.019
JUST YES I WOULD I WOULD LIKEN

01:45:26.086 --> 01:45:28.622

PAY THE BILLS THAT IT'S VERY

01:45:34.628 --> 01:45:35.862
DIFFERENT I WOULD STAY WHERE IT

01:45:35.929 --> 01:45:38.465
IS TODAY. BECAUSE AS WE'VE ALSO

01:45:38.532 --> 01:45:40.434
RAISED A MINIMUM WAGE FOR

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:42.335
EXAMPLE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:45:58.251 --> 01:45:59.186
INDIVIDUAL FRIEDMAN PRODUCE

01:45:59.252 --> 01:46:01.521

BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE. IT SEEMS

01:48:13.887 --> 01:48:16.022
TO BE THAT WE STILL CONCLUDE

01:48:16.089 --> 01:48:17.123

ABILITY TO INCREASE FEES WE

01:48:47.988 --> 01:48:49.189
REALLY HAVE TO DO WITH THE

01:48:49.256 --> 01:48:50.557
STUDY WHERE THAT COMES DIçN

01:48:50.624 --> 01:48:52.292
AND A LOOK AT WHAT IT'S ASKING

01:48:52.359 --> 01:48:54.227
TO DO THE SERVICES THAT WE'RE

01:48:54.294 --> 01:48:55.962
PROVIDING FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:48:56.029 --> 01:48:58.531
AND- JUST TO THE POINT-

01:48:58.598 --> 01:49:00.200
ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW TO THE-

01:49:00.267 --> 01:49:05.305
IMPACT OF. INCREASES AS FAR AS-

01:49:05.372 --> 01:49:07.641
YOU KNOW COMING. I SAY FOR THIS

01:49:07.707 --> 01:49:09.309
PARTICULAR BUREAU YOU KNOW THE

01:49:09.376 --> 01:49:11.077
HADN'T REYES AND FEES FOR A

01:49:11.144 --> 01:49:12.312
SIX. AMOUNT OF TIME BECAUSE

01:49:12.379 --> 01:49:15.649
THEY HAVE LOWER. AND- IT WASN'T

01:49:15.715 --> 01:49:17.083
THAT THE PROPERTIES AT TO WHERE

01:49:17.150 --> 01:49:18.518
THEY WERE BEFORE AND SO I THINK

01:49:18.585 --> 01:49:20.787
IT WAS INTO EIGHTEEN AND THAT

01:49:20.854 --> 01:49:21.821
THEY BROUGHT THEM UP TO WHERE

01:49:21.888 --> 01:49:23.056
THEY COULD BE IMPARTED TO THEM

01:49:23.123 --> 01:49:24.958
BEING REDUCED. AND THEN THEY

01:49:25.025 --> 01:49:26.526
BROUGHT THEM FORWARD IN TWO

01:49:26.593 --> 01:49:28.295
THOUSAND AND TWENTY TWENTY- TO

01:49:28.361 --> 01:49:30.664
RAISE THEM UP TO THEIR- MORE

01:49:30.730 --> 01:49:32.032
TOWARDS THEIR STATUTORY

01:49:32.098 --> 01:49:34.634
REQUIREMENTS. SO I DIDN'T GET

01:49:34.701 --> 01:49:36.503
IT IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME FOR

01:49:36.569 --> 01:49:39.105
THIS ZERO- FOR THEM TO INCREASE

01:49:39.172 --> 01:49:41.408
THEIR FEES. AND THAT AGAIN IS

01:49:41.474 --> 01:49:44.110
WHAT WE LOOK AT- EIGHT I

01:49:44.177 --> 01:49:45.545
UNDERSTAND YOU WANT TO LOOK AT.

01:49:45.612 --> 01:49:48.114
WHAT HAS BEEN INCREASED IN MAY

01:49:48.181 --> 01:49:50.083
BE MANDATORY ISSUES FOR THE-

01:49:50.150 --> 01:49:52.018
BOARDS OF GIRLS TO LOOK AT SO

01:49:52.085 --> 01:49:53.820
HAS THERE BEEN THAT- BILL THAT

01:49:53.887 --> 01:49:59.626
HAS PASSED. OR MAYBE THEY NEED

01:49:59.693 --> 01:50:00.860
TO DO MORE. MORE APT. AND SO

01:50:00.927 --> 01:50:02.195
HAVE TO AT THAT BUT THAT IS

01:50:02.262 --> 01:50:04.464
WHOLE. FOR DOING A FEE ON THAT

01:50:04.531 --> 01:50:05.932
STUDY FOR THE BOARD TO SET.

01:50:05.999 --> 01:50:07.834
WHERE THOSE THINGS ARE FROM AND

01:50:07.901 --> 01:50:09.202
WE WILL DIE. GO BACKFOR THIS

01:50:09.269 --> 01:50:10.804
PARTICULAR BUREAU AND PROVIDE

01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:12.739
THE INFORMATION AND- I'M ESTO

01:50:12.806 --> 01:50:16.042
WHAT IMPACT. REQUIREMENT FOR

01:50:16.109 --> 01:50:18.912
THIS. SO AGAIN I DID

01:50:18.979 --> 01:50:20.447
SPECIFICALLY IT THE ANSWER THE

01:50:20.513 --> 01:50:22.015
QUESTION IT HAS THERE BEEN AN

01:50:22.082 --> 01:50:25.051
INCREASE IN WORKLOAD. AND FOR

01:50:25.118 --> 01:50:26.786
THIS PARTICULAR BOARD I DON'T

01:50:26.853 --> 01:50:28.321
BELIEVE SO BECAUSE OUR BUREAU I

01:50:28.388 --> 01:50:30.123
NEED THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVE

01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:32.492
ACTUALLY HAD A DEEP LYING AND-

01:50:32.559 --> 01:50:36.062
THEIR ACTUAL- LICENSURE AND I

01:50:36.129 --> 01:50:38.198
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE IF I

01:50:38.264 --> 01:50:39.899
REMEMBER LOOKING. ENFORCEMENT

01:50:39.966 --> 01:50:41.868
DATE I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S AN

01:50:41.935 --> 01:50:42.902
INCREASE A PRETTY STAYED PRETTY

01:50:42.969 --> 01:50:44.437
STEADY ON THEIR ENFORCEMENT AND

01:50:44.504 --> 01:50:45.638
THE INFORMATION THAT WAS COMING

01:50:45.705 --> 01:50:47.874
AND THAT. ON DATA THAT HAS BEEN

01:50:47.941 --> 01:50:49.442
COMING IN FROM OUR COMPANY

01:50:49.509 --> 01:50:51.444
THANKS DAD STATE STEADY EVEN

01:50:51.511 --> 01:50:54.914
THOUGH THE LICENSES- HAS

01:50:54.981 --> 01:50:59.486
ACTUALLY GONE. OKAY THOSE THE

01:50:59.552 --> 01:51:01.187
SPECIFIC ANSWER FROM YOU IS

01:51:01.254 --> 01:51:03.056
THAT THERE IS NOT. AN INCREASE

01:51:03.123 --> 01:51:05.258
IN WORKLOAD AND AG AGAIN YOU

01:51:05.325 --> 01:51:06.393
WE'VE WE'VE OUTLINED HERE THAT

01:51:06.459 --> 01:51:08.428
OF. THE DECREASING LICENSEE

01:51:08.495 --> 01:51:11.865
POPULATION. SO ON THE SURFACE

01:51:11.931 --> 01:51:12.365
ONE COULD SAY IT'S OFF A

01:51:12.432 --> 01:51:15.368
COUNTER. INTUITIVE TO INCREASE.

01:51:15.435 --> 01:51:16.903
THE FEES FOR A DECREASING THE

01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:19.105
LICENSEE POPULATION AND PERHAPS

01:51:19.172 --> 01:51:21.374
WE MIGHT LOOK AT CONSOLIDATION

01:51:21.441 --> 01:51:21.941
AS AGAIN ADDRESSED IN ISSUE

01:51:22.008 --> 01:51:26.446
NUMBER SIX. VERSES THAT OF.

01:51:26.513 --> 01:51:28.648
DEFAULTING TO FEE INCREASES TO

01:51:28.715 --> 01:51:30.183
WHICH I THINK PART OF THE

01:51:30.250 --> 01:51:31.418
CHALLENGE THAT WE DEAL WITH

01:51:31.484 --> 01:51:33.520
ALSO IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY AS

01:51:33.586 --> 01:51:35.455
ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES IS

01:51:35.522 --> 01:51:38.758
SOMETIMES THE STATE BUREAUCRACY

01:51:38.825 --> 01:51:40.693
CANNOT SEEM IN TOUCH WITH THAT

01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:42.796
OF THE REALITIES THAT EXIST

01:51:42.862 --> 01:51:43.463
WITH EVERYDAY HARD WORKING

01:51:43.530 --> 01:51:46.733
PEOPLE. AND THAT WHEN WE ARE

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:48.601
TALKING ABOUT OR EVEN THE

01:51:48.668 --> 01:51:49.869
CONVERSATION AROUND FEE

01:51:49.936 --> 01:51:51.438
INCREASES A SIGNIFICANT

01:51:51.504 --> 01:51:52.806
FRUSTRATION THAT GOVERNMENT IS

01:51:52.872 --> 01:51:55.775
NOT WORKING FOR PEOPLE AND THAT

01:51:55.842 --> 01:51:57.577
I THINK IS PART OF THE DUTY

01:51:57.644 --> 01:51:59.712
THAT WE TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY AND

01:51:59.779 --> 01:52:00.947
WORKING WITH YOU AND WORKING

01:52:01.014 --> 01:52:03.083
WITH OUR LICENSEES TO ENSURE

01:52:03.149 --> 01:52:05.552
THAT WE ARE. EFFECTIVE AND THAT

01:52:05.618 --> 01:52:07.954
WERE WORKING TO SERVE THE

01:52:08.021 --> 01:52:10.924
LICENSEE POPULATION. AND AGAIN

01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:12.625
THE FRUSTRATION BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:52:12.692 --> 01:52:13.960
THE BENEFIT OF HAVING YOU IS

01:52:14.027 --> 01:52:16.496
THAT. ESPECIALLY IN THIS

01:52:16.563 --> 01:52:22.268
CLIMATE. IT IS NOT APPROPRIATE

01:52:22.335 --> 01:52:22.802
TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE

01:52:22.869 --> 01:52:25.572
SPEECH INCREASES. GIVEN THE

01:52:25.638 --> 01:52:27.640
CLIMATE AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

01:52:27.707 --> 01:52:30.043
AGAIN WE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE

01:52:30.110 --> 01:52:31.578
CAN TELL THEY WORK TO ENSURE

01:52:31.644 --> 01:52:33.613
THAT WE ARE AS EFFICIENT AND

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:35.281
EFFECTIVE AND ESPECIALLY FOR

01:52:35.348 --> 01:52:37.517
NOT ARTICULATING AND ENHANCED

01:52:37.584 --> 01:52:39.819
TO BENEFIT OR VALUE. I THINK IT

01:52:39.886 --> 01:52:42.422
IS INCUMBENT UPON US THEN TO

01:52:42.489 --> 01:52:43.923
LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES TO.

01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:45.658
EFFECTUATE CHANGE IN A POSITIVE

01:52:45.725 --> 01:52:47.160
FASHION AND NOT TO PUT THE

01:52:47.227 --> 01:52:48.962
BURDEN ON THAT OF THE

01:52:49.028 --> 01:52:51.631
LICENSEES- BUT AGAIN I KNOW

01:52:51.698 --> 01:52:53.533
THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THAT

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:54.367
CONSISTENT WITH OUR

01:52:54.434 --> 01:52:56.035
CONVERSATIONS. BUT I WOULD JUST

01:52:56.102 --> 01:52:58.905
URGE YOU TO ASSIST US IN

01:52:58.972 --> 01:53:01.040

WE ACTUALLY. COME TO THAT

01:53:02.909 --> 01:53:04.544
CONCLUSION BECAUSE THUS FAR MY

01:53:04.611 --> 01:53:07.413
EXPERIENCE. WE CONTINUALLY SEEK

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:09.182
INCREASES AND LEGISLATIVE

01:53:09.249 --> 01:53:11.618
COLLEAGUES HAVE CONTINUOUSLY

SHARED THEIR RESERVATIONS. IN

FORWARD AND AGAIN THAT WAS ON

01:53:24.697 --> 01:53:26.566

BOTH A LONG TERM AND SHORT TERM

01:54:39.372 --> 01:54:41.574
ISSUE THOUGH CONCERNING THE

01:54:41.641 --> 01:54:42.041
BUREAU OF REAL ESTATE

01:54:42.108 --> 01:54:44.143
APPRAISERS. STRUCK THERE'S A

01:54:44.210 --> 01:54:45.678
STRUCTURAL PROBLEM THAT

01:54:45.745 --> 01:54:48.481
THREATENS TO BECOME A DEATH

01:54:48.548 --> 01:54:50.583
SPIRAL FOR THE BUREAU- WHEN

01:54:50.650 --> 01:54:53.253
CREATED IN NINETEEN NINETY AND

01:54:53.319 --> 01:54:55.388
CONTINUOUSLY SENDS. APPRAISERS

01:54:55.455 --> 01:54:57.790
ARE LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:54:57.857 --> 01:54:59.559
AROUND THE COUNTRY ONLY TO

01:54:59.626 --> 01:55:00.460
PERFORM WHAT ARE KNOWN AS

01:55:00.526 --> 01:55:03.162
FEDERALLY RELATED APPRAISALS.

01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:05.565
THOSE ARE GENERALLY LOANS MADE

01:55:05.632 --> 01:55:08.635
BY FEDERALLY REGULATED LENDERS

01:55:08.701 --> 01:55:11.404
IF I LOAN MONEY TO A NEIGHBOR

01:55:11.471 --> 01:55:13.640
FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS NOT A

01:55:13.706 --> 01:55:15.375
FEDERALLY RELATED TRANSACTIONS.

01:55:15.441 --> 01:55:16.809
THE APPRAISAL CAN BE PERFORMED

01:55:16.876 --> 01:55:19.012
BY ANYONE- WITH- WITHOUT A

01:55:19.078 --> 01:55:21.614
LICENSE AND WITHOUT ANY

01:55:21.681 --> 01:55:23.316
PARTICULAR STANDARDS. THE

01:55:23.383 --> 01:55:25.952
GROWTH IN APPRAISAL OVER THE

01:55:26.019 --> 01:55:26.452
THIRTY YEARS SINCE WE'VE

01:55:26.519 --> 01:55:28.621
CREATED THIS LAW HAS BEEN IN

01:55:28.688 --> 01:55:30.456
NON FEDERALLY RELATED

01:55:30.523 --> 01:55:32.492
TRANSACTIONS THINGS LIKE. THAT

01:55:32.558 --> 01:55:34.927
EXPERT WITNESS OR PORTFOLIO

01:55:34.994 --> 01:55:37.497
REVIEW- ALSO ATTENTION OF

01:55:37.563 --> 01:55:39.299
ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT

01:55:39.365 --> 01:55:41.501
GENERALLY RELATED AND THEREFORE

01:55:41.567 --> 01:55:43.503
DO NOT REQUIRE A LICENSE. THAT

01:55:43.569 --> 01:55:45.171
IS PART OF THE REASON FOR THE

01:55:45.238 --> 01:55:48.007
DECLINE IN LICENSING NUMBERS

01:55:48.074 --> 01:55:49.575
THE OTHER MAJOR REASON IS THE

01:55:49.642 --> 01:55:53.079
INCREASED USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND

01:55:53.146 --> 01:55:55.348
VALUING REAL ESTATE- THAT THAT

01:55:55.415 --> 01:55:56.449
IS A TREND THAT IS NOT GOING TO

01:55:56.516 --> 01:55:58.351
CHANGE. THERE IS NO REASON TO

01:55:58.418 --> 01:55:59.485
BELIEVE THAT LICENSE THE

01:55:59.552 --> 01:56:02.021
NUMBERS WILL INCREASE SO YOU

01:56:02.088 --> 01:56:03.356
YOU REALLY RUN INTO THIS

01:56:03.423 --> 01:56:05.325
POTENTIAL OF A REGULATORY

01:56:05.391 --> 01:56:08.161
SPIRAL WHERE FEWER AND FEWER

01:56:08.227 --> 01:56:09.362
PEOPLE ARE PAYING MORE AND

01:56:09.429 --> 01:56:11.464
MORE. FOR THEIR LICENSES WHICH

01:56:11.531 --> 01:56:12.999
WILL CREATE A DISINCENTIVE TO

01:56:13.066 --> 01:56:16.336
HELP ONE. AND THAT'S A LONG

01:56:16.402 --> 01:56:17.637
TERM STRUCTURAL ISSUE THAT I

01:56:17.704 --> 01:56:20.406
REALLY. THANK NEEDS TO BE

01:56:20.473 --> 01:56:23.309
ADDRESSED. THERE'S ALSO A SHORT

01:56:23.376 --> 01:56:26.379
TERM ISSUE ON SEASON WE

01:56:26.446 --> 01:56:28.548
APPRECIATE- THE BOTH CHAIRS

01:56:28.614 --> 01:56:31.684
QUESTIONS AND- AND PROBING ON

FOR A RENEWAL THE LICENSING FEE

01:57:18.398 --> 01:57:20.366
CHART INDICATES THAT THAT IS A

01:57:20.433 --> 01:57:22.235
COMBINATION OF AN APPLICATION

01:57:22.301 --> 01:57:25.571

AND VARIOUS REGISTRATION FEES-

01:57:28.608 --> 01:57:30.109
THERE IS NOTHING IN THE STATUTE

01:57:30.176 --> 01:57:31.944
THAT AUTHORIZES AN APPLICATION

01:57:32.011 --> 01:57:34.380
REVIEW FEE AT IT AND IN FACT

01:57:34.447 --> 01:57:36.816
THAT FEE WAS INCREASED FROM ONE

TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS- AND THAT

01:57:57.703 --> 01:57:59.038
IS REFLECTED IN THE LICENSING

01:57:59.105 --> 01:58:00.406
FEE CHART BUT THERE IS NO

01:58:00.473 --> 01:58:02.108
STATUTE THAT SAYS ANYTHING

01:58:02.175 --> 01:58:04.010
ABOUT AN APPLICATION REVIEW

WAS AUTHORIZED BY LAW BUT WE

01:58:11.384 --> 01:58:15.087
DON'T SEE WHERE THAT IS. AND SO

01:58:15.154 --> 01:58:16.155
YOU KNOW THERE'S BOTH A SHORT

01:58:16.222 --> 01:58:17.957

OF THE REGULATORY PROGRAM

01:58:24.197 --> 01:58:26.132

TO EXPECT A- A REBOUND IN

DIALOGUE. BUT THAT LACK OF

01:58:44.884 --> 01:58:47.053
