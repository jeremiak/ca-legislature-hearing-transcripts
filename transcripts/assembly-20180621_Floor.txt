MY GRANDMOTHER WAS BORN IN COLOMBIA MY GRANDFATHER IN JAMAICA MY FATHER EMIGRATED ALL THE WAY FROM DETROIT MICHIGAN BY WAY OF MISSISSIPPI. THE GRANDPARENTS WHO WERE SLAVES.

LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER WHO WORKED CLEANING PEOPLE'S HOUSES MANY IMMIGRANTS COME HERE JUST WANTED A CHANCE TO WORK. TO CONTRIBUTE AND SOMETIMES TAKING JOBS THAT NO ONE ELSE WOULD WANT.

WE LIVE IN A NATION WHICH SINCE ITS BEGINNING HAS BEEN BUILT BY IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. BUT CURRENTLY WE ARE FACED WITH THE CULMINATION OF LONG STANDING DISCRIMINATORY IN SOCIAL BE ABUSIVE POLICIES REGARDING IMMIGRATION. AND IN PARTICULAR BY THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE A HABIT OF IGNORING THE GREAT HISTORY OF IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY. IN SPITE OF THE MANY CONTRIBUTIONS AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS. WE WERE CELEBRATE AND RECALL THE RICH HISTORY OF IMMIGRANTS IN ALL THE WAYS THEY'VE STRENGTHENED OUR NATION. BY DOING SO WE ACTIVELY FIGHT AGAINST THE FALSE NARRATIVES WHICH SUPPORT BACKWARDS IMMIGRATION POLICIES AND IMMIGRATION ORDERS. AS IT STATES AT THE BASE OF THE STATUE OF LIBERTY. GIVE ME YOUR TIRED YOUR POOR YOUR HUDDLED MASSES YEARNING TO BREATHE FREE. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE FAMILIES ASKING TO SEEK ASYLUM. TO BREATHE IN THE FREEDOM. AND INSTEAD WE SEE THEIR CHILDREN RIPPED AWAY FROM THEM. HAVE WE NOT LEARNED FROM THE SHAMEFUL HISTORY OF SEPARATING CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS. THIS IS NOT THE AMERICA I LOVE. WITH THE IMAGES OF CHILDREN. LOCKED UP IN CAGES. ON UNITED STATES SOIL. CRYING AND PLEADING TO BE RETURNED TO THEIR PARENTS. I FEEL ANGERED AND SADDENED. BUT TODAY I STAND PROUDLY IN SUPPORT OF THE HERITAGE OF ALL IMMIGRANTS. THE INDIVIDUALS WHO SIMPLY WANT ONE THING. THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAFELY AND SECURELY LIVE AND BUILD THEIR DREAMS. THEY WANT TO THE AMERICAN DREAM. WE MUST AND WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT TO MAKE THIS DREAM POSSIBLE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI YOUR RECOGNIZED.

YOUR I'VE WORKED. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AND YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. IF YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR -- ONE TWELVE MYSELF THE SON OF IMMIGRANTS LIKE MY COLLEAGUE GOV FROM OAKLAND. PARENTS FROM PANAMA. BUT I ALSO RISE TO POINT OUT THAT THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN IMMIGRATION HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN A PROUD HISTORY. AND ALTHOUGH WE CELEBRATE OUR SILENT. I SOMETIMES FORGET [inaudible] ANGEL ISLAND -- OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA. PERMISSION TO RE [inaudible] WITHOUT OBJECTION. DESTRUCTION OF ANGEL ISLAND IMMIGRATION STATION BEGAN IN. NINETEEN OH FIVE BUT WAS NOT USED UNTIL. NINETEEN TEN SO THE ZONE WAS KNOWN AS CHINA CO. IT WAS BUILT FOR CONTROLLING CHINESE ENTRY IT TO THE UNITED STATES. FROM. NINETEEN TEN TO NINETEEN FORTY ANGEL ISLAND SERVED AS AN IMMIGRATION STATION. PROCESSING IMMIGRANTS FROM EIGHTY FOUR DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION BEING CHINESE IMMIGRANTS. PURPOSE OF THIS IMMIGRATION STATION. WAS TO INVESTIGATE CHINESE WHO HAD BEEN DIE DENIED ENTRY. BECAUSE OF THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO IMMIGRANTS HAD TO PROVE THAT THEY HAD HUSBANDS OR FATHERS. WHO WERE UNITED STATES CITIZENS IN ORDER NOT TO BE DEPORTED? ANGEL ISLAND WAS A HUMILIATING EXPERIENCE FOR MANY IMMIGRANTS WE CAN GO THEIR TODAY AND SEE THE WRITINGS ON THE WALL OF THE IMMIGRANTS WHO WERE HELD THERE. UP TO TWO YEARS. SO AS WE CELEBRATE ELLIS ISLAND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE REMEMBER ANGEL ISLAND. THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION HR ONE TWELVE EIGHT IT'S HR ONE TWELVE BY MISTER CHIU. FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO. AND WHILE WE CELEBRATE THE WONDERS OF IMMIGRATION AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT HAS BASICALLY HELPED TO BUILD THIS NATION. I HAVE TO TAKE ISSUE WITH ONLY ONE CONCEPT. THE ENSLAVED WERE NOT IMMIGRANTS. IT THE CONCEPT OF IMMIGRATION IMPLIES THERE'S A DESIRE TO COME. THAT YOU'RE SEEKING A BETTER LIFE. AND THAT THIS COUNTRY HOPEFULLY WILL WELCOME YOU IN. THAT IS NOT THE LIFE OF MY GRANDPARENTS AND MY GREAT GRANDPARENTS. AND SO AS WE TALK ABOUT IMMIGRATION I WANT TO ALWAYS REMIND FOLKS THAT THERE IS A POPULATION IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT HELPED TO BUILD THIS NATION. SPENT A LOT OF THEIR TIME IN BLOOD AND ENERGY WORKING ON BEHALF OF CREATING AN AMERICA. THAT WERE NOT IMMIGRANTS AND THE IN SLAVE SHOULD NEVER BE CLASSIFIED WITH THE IMMIGRANTS NOT THAT THAT'S A SHAME TO IT BUT IT'S A SHAME TO US THAT WE WOULD THAT WE WOULD DISREGARD. HOW WE GOT HERE THE STRUGGLE THAT WE'VE HAD AND OUR CONTINUING EFFORT TO BE SEEN AS EQUAL WITH EVERYONE ELSE SO I SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION I KNOW THAT ARE IMMIGRANTS HAVE WORKED HARD IN THIS COUNTRY? HAVE HELPED TO BUILD THIS NATION WOULD NEVER EVER SHOULD WE EVER SAY THAT THE ENSLAVED WERE IMMIGRANTS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MEN'S BIGGER MEMBERS -- GUYS A DESCENDANT OF IMMIGRANTS TO THIS COUNTRY I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT. OF HR ONE TWELVE AND YOU KNOW WHEN MY ANCESTOR CHARLES GALLAGHER CAME TO THIS COUNTRY IN -- EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT NO THIS WAS THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY FROM IRELAND HERE WITH A SCAPIN. A PLACE WHERE HE FACED OPPRESSION -- HIS SON ANTHONY WAS THE FIRST TO BE BORN. HERE IN THE UNITED STATES -- SO I'M VERY SENSITIVE -- WHEN WE HEAR XENOPHOBIC AND ANTI IMMIGRANT [inaudible] RHETORIC. BECAUSE MY ANCESTORS FACE NEED A LAWS NO IRISH NEED APPLY -- MY ANCESTORS WERE OFTEN PUSHED OUT A COMMUNITIES AS WELL -- AND AND FACED THOSE SAME KIND OF AT THAT SAME KIND OF ADVERSITY SO I AM VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT. AND WE SHOULD CALL THAT OUT WHEN WE SEE IT. WE SHOULD CALL OUT INJUSTICE WHEN WE SEE IT [inaudible] BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF THIS OVER THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS TO USE WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW IS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL. ON BOTH SIDES. IS NOT HELPFUL AND DOESN'T HELP US GET TO WHERE WE ALL KNOW WE NEED TO GO. I'M GLAD THAT THE PRESIDENT. HEARD THE CAUSE OF MANY OF US FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE TO AND FAMILY SEPARATIONS AT THE BORDER. YOU WOULD DO HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER YESTERDAY. THAT IS AN A BORN IN IT'S AN IMMORAL PRACTICE. AND PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES HAVE SAID THAT IT'S ALSO A PRACTICE IT OCCURRED UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION AS WELL. AND WE NEED TO WE NEED TO CALL OUT THE TRUTH. IT'S AN ABORT PRACTICE NO MATTER WHOSE ADMINISTRATION IF FALLS UNDER. IT ALSO NEEDS TO BE SAID. THEY CATCH AND RELEASE IS NOT. A HUMANE POLICY BECAUSE CATCH AND RELEASE ACTUALLY ENABLES HUMAN TRAFFICKERS. AND ENABLES DRUG CARTELS. TO DO WHAT THEY DO TO PEOPLE WHICH IS A BORN IN A MORAL AS WELL WE NEED [inaudible] A GOOD. IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM POLICY IN THIS COUNTRY AND WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS THAT. IT'S CONGRESS'S RESPONSIBILITY. THAT'S SO WE SHOULD ALL ON BOTH SIDES ALLEN COURAGE OUR LEGISLATORS ARE CONGRESS MEMBERS. OUR SENATORS TO GET TO WORK. BECAUSE IT'S THEIR JOB TO ENSURE THAT THAT IMMIGRANTS. CAN COME TO THIS COUNTRY THAT THOSE SEEKING ASYLUM CAN COME TO THIS COUNTRY. AND THAT HAS DONE SO IN AN ORDERLY PROCESS ONE THAT PROTECTS FAMILIES AND PROTECTS ALL PEOPLE -- AND SO LET'S LET'S JUST BE REAL ABOUT. WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE LET'S NOT USE THAT AS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL ON EITHER SIDE OF THE AISLE. LET'S ENCOURAGE GOOD POLICY BE MADE SO THAT SO THIS COUNTRY CONTINUE TO BE. A PLACE OF REFUGE. AND A PLACE WHERE IMMIGRANTS WHO COME AND BUILD ON THE GREATNESS OF THIS COUNTRY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEEING NO FURTHER REQUEST TO SPEAK.
