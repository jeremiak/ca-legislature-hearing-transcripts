IT PROVIDES OUR COLLEGE ATHLETES

00:32:57.809 --> 00:32:59.544
THE SAME RIGHTS AS OLYMPIC

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:02.280
ATHLETES TO RECEIVE A FINANCIAL

00:33:02.347 --> 00:33:04.515

LIKENESS THROUGH SPONSORSHIPS

AND ENDORSEMENTS.

00:33:08.019 --> 00:33:10.054
YESTERDAY ON THE FLOOR OF BOTH

00:33:10.121 --> 00:33:12.790
OF OUR HOUSES FOR PRIDE MONTH WE

00:33:12.857 --> 00:33:14.292
ARE HONORED A NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:33:14.359 --> 00:33:17.528
AMONG THEM WAS FORMER NBA PLAYER

00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:18.196
JASON COLLINS [inaudible]

00:33:18.262 --> 00:33:20.198
NOW.

00:33:20.264 --> 00:33:21.599
AFTER THE CEREMONY I WAS

00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:23.134
SPEAKING WITH JASON COLLINS AND

00:33:23.201 --> 00:33:24.635
HE HAD SEEN THE USA TODAY

00:33:24.702 --> 00:33:27.705
ARTICLE SO WE TALKED ABOUT SB.

00:33:27.772 --> 00:33:28.973
TWO OH SIX WHAT DID HE TELL ME

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.275
HE SAID THAT AS A STUDENT AT

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:32.710
STANFORD.

00:33:32.777 --> 00:33:35.580
HE SAW HIMSELF DEPICTED IN A

00:33:35.646 --> 00:33:37.815
VIDEO GAME ABOUT BASKETBALL.

00:33:37.882 --> 00:33:39.250
THIS WAS A GAME THAT HE HAD

00:33:39.317 --> 00:33:40.451
PURCHASED.

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:42.387
YET IT WAS USING HIS LIKENESS

00:33:42.453 --> 00:33:44.789
WITHOUT PERMISSION OR WITHOUT

00:33:44.856 --> 00:33:46.591
PROVIDING ANY PAYMENT.

00:33:46.657 --> 00:33:47.725
THESE ARE THE TYPES OF

00:33:47.792 --> 00:33:49.293
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COLLEGE

00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.163
ATHLETES CONTINUALLY FACE.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:54.165
NOW FOR FEMALE ATHLETES THE

00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:55.333
PROBLEM IS EVEN MORE SERIOUS

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.136
BECAUSE AND I IMAGINE MANY OF

00:33:58.202 --> 00:34:00.037
YOU ARE THINKING YOU KNOW THE

00:34:00.104 --> 00:34:01.506
MALE ATHLETES THEY HAVE THE

00:34:01.572 --> 00:34:03.007
POSSIBILITY TO GO PRO.

00:34:03.074 --> 00:34:04.475
OF COURSE YOU'LL HEAR LATER WHAT

00:34:04.542 --> 00:34:06.644
TINY TINY PERCENT OF ATHLETES

00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:08.146
EVERY EVEN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:34:08.212 --> 00:34:09.981
GO PRO BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT

00:34:10.047 --> 00:34:11.549
WOMEN ATHLETES.

00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:12.984
THERE ARE FEW TO NO PROFESSIONAL

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.118
OPPORTUNITIES.

00:34:14.185 --> 00:34:17.355
COLLEGE MAY BE THE ONLY TIME FOR

00:34:17.422 --> 00:34:19.190
WHICH THEIR ATHLETIC PROWESS

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:21.559
MAYBE SO VALUED THAT THEY MIGHT

00:34:21.626 --> 00:34:23.795
BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR HOME TOWN

00:34:23.861 --> 00:34:25.163
CAR DEALER FOR THAT MATTER

00:34:25.229 --> 00:34:27.064
SPONSORED THEM OR ROTARY CLUB OR

00:34:27.131 --> 00:34:28.433
QANTAS CLUB.

00:34:28.499 --> 00:34:30.067
ALL OF WHICH IS PROHIBITED NOW

00:34:30.134 --> 00:34:32.637
UNDER THE AND SEE TO A ROLES.

00:34:32.703 --> 00:34:34.372
AND THOSE RULES CREATE AS I

00:34:34.439 --> 00:34:36.574
MENTIONED VERY UNFAIR CONDITIONS

00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:39.076
CONDITIONS THAT THE FORMER CHIEF

00:34:39.143 --> 00:34:41.913
OPERATING OFFICER OF THE NC TO A

00:34:41.979 --> 00:34:44.449
DâN BOGAN WHO WAS ALSO A FORMER

00:34:44.515 --> 00:34:47.118
VICE CHANCELLOR AT UC BERKELEY.

00:34:47.185 --> 00:34:49.220
HE SAYS THEY ARE CONTRADICTORY

00:34:49.287 --> 00:34:51.956
TO A KEY TENET OF THE NC TWO

00:34:52.023 --> 00:34:53.624
EIGHT OWN BYLAWS.

00:34:53.691 --> 00:34:56.194
AND IN WITHIN THE NC TWO WAYS BY

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.930
LAWS IS THE FOLLOWING PHRASE.

00:34:58.996 --> 00:35:00.932
THAT THEIR RULES ASSURE THAT

00:35:00.998 --> 00:35:02.867
ATHLETICS PARTICIPANTS ARE NOT

00:35:02.934 --> 00:35:04.502
TREATED DIFFERENTLY FROM ANY

00:35:04.569 --> 00:35:07.271
OTHER MEMBER OF THE STUDENT BODY.

00:35:07.338 --> 00:35:09.140
AND YET AS I DESCRIBED THE

00:35:09.207 --> 00:35:13.744
STUDENTS ARE TREATED DIFFERENTLY

00:35:13.811 --> 00:35:14.779
THAN ANY OTHER [inaudible]

00:35:14.846 --> 00:35:16.848
STUDENT MEMBER -- I'M GONNA TURN

00:35:16.914 --> 00:35:19.650

REDUNDANT BUT I THINK ARE.

00:35:26.958 --> 00:35:28.326
SINNERS SKINNER MADE IT CLEAR

00:35:28.392 --> 00:35:30.161
THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT'S NOT

00:35:30.228 --> 00:35:32.029
REALLY CENTERED ON SPORTS CENTER

00:35:32.096 --> 00:35:34.565
ON FAIRNESS AND IN MANY WAYS

00:35:34.632 --> 00:35:36.200
IT'S A CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE --

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:38.002
AGAIN THE MAJORITY OF THESE

00:35:38.069 --> 00:35:40.838
ATHLETES -- ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN

00:35:40.905 --> 00:35:42.974
OVER HALF OF ON YOUR FOOTBALL

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.009
AND BASKETBALL TEAMS ARE AFRICAN

00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:46.744
AMERICAN YOUNG MAN DESPITE THE

00:35:46.811 --> 00:35:49.447
FACT THAT THE ONLY MAKE UP 3%.

00:35:49.514 --> 00:35:51.382

A UNIVERSITIES MAKE MILLIONS OF

00:36:00.258 --> 00:36:01.092
DOLLARS BECAUSE OF THEIR

00:36:01.158 --> 00:36:02.527
ATHLETIC TALENT.

00:36:02.593 --> 00:36:04.328
AND THE REAL CONTRARY HERE IS

00:36:04.395 --> 00:36:05.963
THAT YOU HAVE CULTURES THAT COME

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.766

THAT THESE ATHLETES APPLY A PLAY

00:36:18.776 --> 00:36:21.012
AT AND AGAIN THESE ATHLETES ARE

00:36:21.078 --> 00:36:24.649

FROM ME WHILE IN COLLEGE BECAUSE

00:36:37.128 --> 00:36:38.462
DESPITE BEING ON A SCHOLARSHIP

00:36:38.529 --> 00:36:39.931

00:36:46.704 --> 00:36:48.606
MINIMAL A SITUATION YET WE ALL

KNOW YOU NEED FAR MORE.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.541
THAN THAT TO SURVIVE MANY OF

00:36:50.608 --> 00:36:59.150
THESE ATHLETES DID NOT EVEN HAVE

00:36:59.216 --> 00:37:00.651
CARS.

00:37:00.718 --> 00:37:01.752
NOT TO GET TO AND FROM.

ATHLETE AT SOME FOLKS WANNA MAKE

00:37:12.496 --> 00:37:14.031
THIS OUT BUT THE REAL PHENOMENON

00:37:14.098 --> 00:37:15.499
HERE IS THAT.

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:16.434

OF THE DISPUTE OVER PAY FOR PLAY

00:42:50.668 --> 00:42:52.069
IS EXACTLY.

00:42:52.136 --> 00:42:53.437
WHAT THIS BILL [inaudible]

00:42:53.504 --> 00:42:59.243
IT'S THE BILL IS IS IS

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:02.246
APPROPRIATE -- FOR SEVERAL

00:43:02.313 --> 00:43:02.846
REASONS ONE IS THAT IT'S FAIR

00:43:02.913 --> 00:43:03.714
AND IT'S QUITE CONSISTENT WITH

00:43:03.781 --> 00:43:05.115
CALIFORNIA LAW WHICH IS

00:43:05.182 --> 00:43:05.950
UNDERMINED.

00:43:06.016 --> 00:43:07.851
BY THE NCAA CALIFORNIA LAW

00:43:07.918 --> 00:43:10.321
RECOGNIZES INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

00:43:10.387 --> 00:43:12.122
IT RECOGNIZES THE NAME IMAGE AND

00:43:12.189 --> 00:43:14.091
LIKENESS AS A AS A RIGHT THAT

00:43:14.158 --> 00:43:16.093
ALL OF US HAVE ALL OF US CAN

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.095
MONETIZE HER NAME'S IMAGES AND

00:43:18.162 --> 00:43:19.997
LIKE IT'S AS IF THEY'RE WORTH

00:43:20.064 --> 00:43:21.632
ANYTHING MINE ISN'T WORTH MUCH.

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:22.199
OTHERS ARE WORTH A WHOLE LOT

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:22.399
MORE.

00:43:22.466 --> 00:43:25.769
BUT AN ATHLETE WHO WISHES TO GO

00:43:25.836 --> 00:43:27.304
TO COLLEGE WHICH I THINK IT'S

00:43:27.371 --> 00:43:28.572
SOMETHING WE TRY TO ENCOURAGE.

00:43:28.639 --> 00:43:32.376
CANNOT MONETIZE -- CANNOT

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:34.244
MONETIZE HIS OR HER NAME IMAGE

00:43:34.311 --> 00:43:36.480
AND LIKENESS AT RISK OF LOSING.

00:43:36.547 --> 00:43:38.649
COLLEGE EDUCATION SO WERE WERE

00:43:38.716 --> 00:43:40.384
UNDERMINING CALIFORNIA LAW

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:40.684
[inaudible]

00:43:40.751 --> 00:43:44.088
THE CURRENT STATUS QUO

00:43:44.154 --> 00:43:46.623
DISCOURAGES EDUCATION.

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.158
SOMETHING THAT I DON'T THINK

00:43:48.225 --> 00:43:49.693
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE WANTS TO

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.428
DO IT DISCOURAGES STUDENTS FROM

00:43:51.495 --> 00:43:52.496
GOING SCHOOL.

00:43:52.563 --> 00:43:54.732
DISCOURAGES THEM FROM STAYING.

00:43:54.798 --> 00:43:56.934
AT SCHOOL BECAUSE MANY OF THE

00:43:57.001 --> 00:43:58.235
BEST STUDENTS WITH THE BIGGEST

00:43:58.302 --> 00:44:00.104
BIGGEST NAMES AND MANY OF THE

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:02.139
OTHER STUDENTS WITH THE JUST THE

00:44:02.206 --> 00:44:04.441
ROLE PLAYERS AND THE NON REVENUE

00:44:04.508 --> 00:44:04.675
SPORTS.

00:44:04.742 --> 00:44:06.377
REPORT.

00:44:06.443 --> 00:44:07.011
MANY OF THEM WERE JUST MIDDLE

00:44:07.077 --> 00:44:08.712
CLASS GOING TO COLLEGE IS

00:44:08.779 --> 00:44:10.214
EXPENSIVE.

00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:12.383
AND AS HAS BEEN SAID.

00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:13.450
EARLIER.

00:44:13.517 --> 00:44:14.651
A SCHOLARSHIP DOESN'T PROVIDE

00:44:14.718 --> 00:44:16.520
EVERYTHING THERE ON A CAMPUS

00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:18.422
WHERE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE SPENDING

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:19.890
MONEY THERE ARE OTHER THINGS ONE

00:44:19.957 --> 00:44:20.891
WOULD LIKE TO DO THERE ARE

00:44:20.958 --> 00:44:21.792
TRAINING COSTS.

00:44:21.859 --> 00:44:25.396
AND THEY HAVE NO ACCESS TO ANY

00:44:25.462 --> 00:44:27.398
MONEY OTHER THAN EXACTLY WHAT

00:44:27.464 --> 00:44:28.799
THE UNIVERSITY PROVIDES THAT.

00:44:28.866 --> 00:44:29.767
THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL

00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:32.102
DISINCENTIVE TO GO TO SCHOOL OR

00:44:32.169 --> 00:44:33.837
TO STAY IN SCHOOL THE YOUNG LADY

00:44:33.904 --> 00:44:35.105

QUITE WELL KNOWN FOR HER SOCCER

00:44:40.811 --> 00:44:42.046
SHOULD NEVER GO TO COLLEGE.

00:44:42.112 --> 00:44:43.947
BECAUSE SHE HIRED AN AGENT.

00:44:44.014 --> 00:44:45.716
AND SHE'S MONETIZING HER SOCIAL

00:44:45.783 --> 00:44:48.385
MEDIA PRESENCE IN ORDER TO PAY

00:44:48.452 --> 00:44:49.887
FOR THE TRAINING THAT SHE NEEDS

00:44:49.953 --> 00:44:52.389
AS A AS A WOULD BE.

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:54.058
FUTURE PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE OR

TO FUTURE MEMBER OF THE U. S.

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:57.995
WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM SO IT

00:44:58.062 --> 00:44:58.595
FOURTEEN SHE'S BEEN FORCED TO

00:44:58.662 --> 00:44:59.596
CHOOSE BETWEEN.

00:44:59.663 --> 00:45:01.165
FOLLOWING HER DREAM AND HER

00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:04.234

PERMANENTLY INELIGIBLE.

00:45:07.237 --> 00:45:08.072
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO TO

00:45:08.138 --> 00:45:09.740
BRING IT BACK I DON'T THINK BUT

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:11.875
THERE ARE A LOT MORE OUT THERE

00:45:11.942 --> 00:45:13.377

SO YOU CAN GET AN EDUCATION OR

YOU CAN FOLLOW HIS DREAM.

00:45:44.608 --> 00:45:45.876
I MAKE A VERY PERSONAL TO ME

00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:47.711
BECAUSE I'M NOT A CALIFORNIA

00:45:47.778 --> 00:45:48.579

00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:02.693
WHY?

00:46:02.759 --> 00:46:03.293
I CAN ONLY TELL YOU ONE FACT

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.661
THAT MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANT WHICH

00:46:04.728 --> 00:46:06.230
IS THAT HIS BROTHER IS A

00:46:06.296 --> 00:46:07.364
PROFESSIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYER

00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:09.666
AND HIS FAMILY IS PROBABLY WHAT

00:46:09.733 --> 00:46:10.801
YOU WOULD CALL UPPER MIDDLE

00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:12.536
CLASS HE GOT TO CHOOSE.

00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:14.471
HE CHOSE.

00:46:14.538 --> 00:46:15.806
THE STATE GET A FURTHER

EDUCATION AND MAYBE MAKE HIS

00:46:17.708 --> 00:46:20.544
GAME A LITTLE BETTER. EIGHTEEN

00:46:20.611 --> 00:46:21.778
YEARS AGO DO CAT A POINT GUARD

00:46:21.845 --> 00:46:24.248
SAME POSITION WILL AVERY.

00:46:24.314 --> 00:46:24.815
MIKE SHE CHESKY A COACH YOU

00:46:24.882 --> 00:46:26.250
PROBABLY HEARD OF RECOMMENDED HE

00:46:26.316 --> 00:46:28.619
STAY FOR ONE OR TWO MORE YEARS

00:46:28.685 --> 00:46:30.654
AND HE LEFT APOLOGIZED TO THE

00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:31.221
COACH.

00:46:31.288 --> 00:46:33.257
AND THE SYSTEM IN SAID.

00:46:33.323 --> 00:46:34.491
MY MOTHER DOESN'T HAVE ANY FOOD

00:46:34.558 --> 00:46:36.527
YOU CAN'T PAY THE RENT I CAN'T

00:46:36.593 --> 00:46:38.061
BE HERE ANY LONGER I'M SIGNING A

00:46:38.128 --> 00:46:39.129
CONTRACT.

00:46:39.196 --> 00:46:40.764
THAT'S NOT A POSITION YOU WANT

00:46:40.831 --> 00:46:42.766
TO PUT YOUNG PEOPLE IN CHOOSING

00:46:42.833 --> 00:46:44.635
BETWEEN AN EDUCATION.

00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:46.069
AND AND TAKING CARE OF THEIR

00:46:46.136 --> 00:46:47.037
FAMILIES ARE TAKING CARE OF

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:48.338
THEMSELVES SO THE RULE REALLY

00:46:48.405 --> 00:46:52.442
DISCOURAGES EDUCATION AND FORCES

00:46:52.509 --> 00:46:54.077
UNFORTUNATE DECISIONS.

00:46:54.144 --> 00:46:55.078
OTHERS HAVE ALREADY SAID THIS IS

00:46:55.145 --> 00:46:56.813
TOTALLY INCONSISTENT WITH HOW WE

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.148
TREAT.

00:46:58.215 --> 00:47:00.417
ARTISTS MUSICIANS AND ACTORS ON

00:47:00.484 --> 00:47:02.386
CAMPUS THEY CAN THEY CAN COMPETE

00:47:02.452 --> 00:47:05.589
IN NATIONAL INTERNATIONAL

00:47:05.656 --> 00:47:07.191
COMPETITIONS -- WITHOUT WORRYING

00:47:07.257 --> 00:47:08.892
ABOUT WHETHER THEY'RE MAKING ANY

00:47:08.959 --> 00:47:11.094
MONEY ON THE SIDE -- I THINK IT

00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:12.663
RAISES VERY SERIOUS AND I TRUST

00:47:12.729 --> 00:47:14.665
PROBLEMS BECAUSE NO UNIVERSITY

00:47:14.731 --> 00:47:15.799
COULD EVEN MAKE ITS OWN DECISION

00:47:15.866 --> 00:47:16.833
ON THIS ASSEMBLY DECIDED TO

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.202
EXPERIMENT.

00:47:18.268 --> 00:47:19.903
AND DO WHAT SENATOR SKINNER HAS

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:21.505
PROPOSED.

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:22.673
THEY WOULD BE IN TROUBLE THERE

00:47:22.739 --> 00:47:24.374
BUT THE UNIVERSITIES ARE MAKING

00:47:24.441 --> 00:47:26.810
THE DECISIONS THE NCAA IS.

00:47:26.877 --> 00:47:27.978
FINALLY I WOULD SAY.

00:47:28.045 --> 00:47:29.980
THE BILL IS VERY BALANCED.

00:47:30.047 --> 00:47:31.782
IT DOESN'T REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO

00:47:31.848 --> 00:47:33.350
PAY SALARIES.

00:47:33.417 --> 00:47:35.919

ATHLETIC DIRECTOR AT LONG BEACH

SPEAK WITH ALL OF YOU TODAY.

00:50:24.354 --> 00:50:25.389
I AM HERE IN OPPOSITION OF THIS

00:50:25.455 --> 00:50:26.757
BILL AND BRIEFLY WANT TO SHARE

00:50:26.823 --> 00:50:27.391
MY THOUGHTS AND CONCERNS THERE

00:50:27.457 --> 00:50:28.892
ARE MANY POTENTIAL UNINTENDED

00:50:28.959 --> 00:50:31.128
CONSEQUENCES OF THIS BILL.

00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:33.063
THE CO AUTHORS PAINT ONE

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:34.197
POSSIBLE SCENARIO.

00:50:34.264 --> 00:50:35.332
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO

00:50:35.399 --> 00:50:36.633
ANOTHER POSSIBLE SCENARIO WHERE

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:37.834
THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE FOR

00:50:37.901 --> 00:50:39.236
AND STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS GOES

00:50:39.302 --> 00:50:40.670
AWAY.

00:50:40.737 --> 00:50:42.439
LONG BEACH STATE JUST HAPPENS TO

00:50:42.506 --> 00:50:43.907
BE THE HOME OF THE BACK TO BACK

00:50:43.974 --> 00:50:45.342
DEFENDING NATIONAL CHAMPION

00:50:45.409 --> 00:50:47.778
MEN'S VOLLEYBALL PROGRAM.

00:50:47.844 --> 00:50:49.913
IF CALIFORNIA CREATES RULES THAT

00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:51.748
DRASTICALLY CONTRAST CURRENT AND

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:53.483
STATE PRINCIPLES AND THE FABRIC

00:50:53.550 --> 00:50:54.851
OF AMATEURISM THE BECOMES AN

00:50:54.918 --> 00:50:57.621
INHERENT ISSUE OF TWO WORLDS

00:50:57.687 --> 00:50:58.889
THAT CANNOT CO EXIST.

00:50:58.955 --> 00:51:00.624
I FEAR THE DISTINCT POSSIBILITY

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:02.192
OF A SCENARIO WHERE CALIFORNIA

00:51:02.259 --> 00:51:04.161
SCHOOLS COULD BE EXPELLED FOR

00:51:04.227 --> 00:51:06.563
WILLFUL BREAKING OF NCAA RULES.

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:08.064
WHICH IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO WHAT

00:51:08.131 --> 00:51:11.034
THE NCAA REFERS TO AS A LACK OF

00:51:11.101 --> 00:51:13.970
INSTITUTIONAL CONTROL.

00:51:14.037 --> 00:51:15.172
SHE CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS BE

00:51:15.238 --> 00:51:16.072
EXPELLED THE VERY STUDENT

00:51:16.139 --> 00:51:17.808
ATHLETES THE BILL IS INTENDED TO

00:51:17.874 --> 00:51:19.543
ASSIST WOULD BE ADVERSELY

00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:20.444
AFFECTED.

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:22.479
DUE TO POSSIBLE LOSS OF

00:51:22.546 --> 00:51:24.047
SCHOLARSHIP OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO

00:51:24.114 --> 00:51:25.949
SHATTERING OF NCAA ATHLETICS IN

00:51:26.016 --> 00:51:27.417
CALIFORNIA.

00:51:27.484 --> 00:51:29.286
I WOULD ADD THE CONVERSATION

00:51:29.352 --> 00:51:29.786
WE'RE HAVING TODAY IS AN

00:51:29.853 --> 00:51:31.154
IMPORTANT.

00:51:31.221 --> 00:51:32.556
ONE AND WE ARE ALL FOCUSED ON

00:51:32.622 --> 00:51:33.590
ENHANCING THE STUDENT ATHLETE

00:51:33.657 --> 00:51:35.192
EXPERIENCE.

00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:36.860
HOWEVER MY PERSONAL OPINION IS

00:51:36.927 --> 00:51:39.796
THIS IS THE WRONG MECHANISM. TO

00:51:39.863 --> 00:51:41.498
ACHIEVE THAT GOAL AND ULTIMATELY

00:51:41.565 --> 00:51:43.567
DOES MORE HARM THAN GOOD.

00:51:43.633 --> 00:51:45.202
THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENTS THAT

00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:46.436
WE HOST TEACHER AT LONG BEACH

00:51:46.503 --> 00:51:49.239
STATE UNIVERSITY IS COMMENCEMENT.

00:51:49.306 --> 00:51:50.240
AND I FEAR THAT MANY FIRST

00:51:50.307 --> 00:51:51.942
GENERATIONS DO NATALIE IT'S

00:51:52.008 --> 00:51:53.877
COULD LOSE THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR

00:51:53.944 --> 00:51:55.178
THE MOST IMPORTANT AND WHAT I

00:51:55.245 --> 00:51:57.447
DESCRIBE AS PRICELESS A COLLEGE

00:51:57.514 --> 00:52:01.918
DEGREE.

00:52:01.985 --> 00:52:04.020
THAT DEGREE CARRIES THEM FORWARD.

00:52:04.087 --> 00:52:05.288
AND CAN HELP THEM ACHIEVE THEIR

00:52:05.355 --> 00:52:08.158
GOALS DREAMS OR ASPIRATIONS.

00:52:08.225 --> 00:52:11.228
AND IT IS LIFE CHANGING.

00:52:11.294 --> 00:52:12.429
IN CLOSING.

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:14.097
I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL AGAIN

THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible]

STATE.

00:52:32.249 --> 00:52:34.384
I OPPOSE IT LEGISLATION BECAUSE

00:52:34.451 --> 00:52:36.953
IT.

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.556
IT ALIGNS WITH THE POTENTIAL --

00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:43.260
TO BE HARSHLY LIMITING -- TO OUR

00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:47.597
OUR STUDENT ATHLETES.

00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:51.067
IT CAN LIMIT THEM IN MANY WAYS.

00:52:51.134 --> 00:52:52.202
FIRST IN THE COMPETITIVE

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:54.971
OPPORTUNITIES.

00:52:55.038 --> 00:52:55.972
EVEN BY SPORT.

00:52:56.039 --> 00:52:57.941
AND CERTAINLY BY GENDER.

00:52:58.008 --> 00:53:00.877
DEFINITELY BY GENDER.

00:53:00.944 --> 00:53:02.679
I CHAIR THE DIVERSITY AND

00:53:02.746 --> 00:53:05.115
INCLUSION COMMITTEE -- AT LONG

00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:06.216
BEACH STATE AND OUR ATHLETIC

00:53:06.283 --> 00:53:07.417
DEPARTMENT.

00:53:07.484 --> 00:53:09.152
AND WHAT ARE COR.

00:53:09.219 --> 00:53:10.887
MOTIVATION IS TO INCLUDE TO

00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:13.657
WELCOME.

00:53:13.723 --> 00:53:16.393
AND THIS BILL IMMEDIATELY

00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:16.693
[inaudible]

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:18.628
IMMEDIATELY.

00:53:18.695 --> 00:53:20.564
IT'S A DIVIDE.

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:25.435
IT DIVIDES BECAUSE IT'S MEN.

00:53:25.502 --> 00:53:27.671
FOOTBALL IT'S MEN BASKETBALL

00:53:27.737 --> 00:53:30.073
IT'S MEN BASEBALL THAT WILL

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:32.008
LITERALLY GET THE IMMEDIATE.

00:53:32.075 --> 00:53:32.976
THE IMMEDIATE.

00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:35.245
ADVANTAGE.

00:53:35.312 --> 00:53:36.246
WHERE OUR MINOR SPORTS?

00:53:36.313 --> 00:53:37.914
SUCH IS.

00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:39.349
OUR STUDENTS AT THE STUDENT

00:53:39.416 --> 00:53:40.417
ATHLETES THAT I COACH.

00:53:40.483 --> 00:53:41.751
THERE MIGHT THAT TO MINORITY

00:53:41.818 --> 00:53:43.186
SPORT IN TRACK AND FIELD.

00:53:43.253 --> 00:53:46.923
I HEARD SOMEONE SAY TODAY THAT.

00:53:46.990 --> 00:53:49.259
THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES

00:53:49.326 --> 00:53:54.030
WOULD -- BE COMPROMISED.

00:53:54.097 --> 00:53:55.498
I SAY THAT THE RIGOR OF GOING

00:53:55.565 --> 00:53:57.267
PRO.

00:53:57.334 --> 00:54:00.437
AND ALL THE HOURS THAT IT TAKES.

00:54:00.503 --> 00:54:02.372
THAT IS THE LIMITING FACTOR.

00:54:02.439 --> 00:54:04.107
YOU HEAR ALL THE TIME HOW

00:54:04.174 --> 00:54:05.976
ATHLETES ARE GOING BACK TO

00:54:06.042 --> 00:54:07.177
SCHOOL AND EARNING THEIR DEGREE

00:54:07.243 --> 00:54:08.378
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT THEY

00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:09.713
HAVE TO WAIT.

00:54:09.779 --> 00:54:11.147
I'M SUGGESTING THAT THERE IS A

00:54:11.214 --> 00:54:12.882
RECORD THAT IS IMMENSE I'M AN

00:54:12.949 --> 00:54:15.619
OLYMPIAN.

00:54:15.685 --> 00:54:16.853
I'M ALSO AN OLYMPIC COACH.

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:19.723
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT OUR POOL OF

00:54:19.789 --> 00:54:21.157
ATHLETES THEY COME FROM THE

00:54:21.224 --> 00:54:23.460
UNIVERSITY THAT IS OUR POOL OF

00:54:23.526 --> 00:54:24.327
ATHLETES.

00:54:24.394 --> 00:54:25.929
AND THOSE ATHLETES.

00:54:25.996 --> 00:54:28.098
I SPECIFICALLY COACH THE SPRINT

00:54:28.164 --> 00:54:30.233
AS WELL AS THE HURDLES.

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:31.735
THAT SEEM TO HAVE THE LARGER

00:54:31.801 --> 00:54:34.037
MINORITY BASE.

00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:34.638
THESE ARE KIDS THAT WERE JUST

00:54:34.704 --> 00:54:35.772
LIKE ME [inaudible]

00:54:35.839 --> 00:54:37.641
GREW UP.

00:54:37.707 --> 00:54:40.010
NOT NECESSARILY HAVING A FULL

00:54:40.076 --> 00:54:40.777
SCHOLARSHIP WHAT WAS IN THE

00:54:40.844 --> 00:54:42.445
ELITE ATHLETE BUT HAD TO WORK

00:54:42.512 --> 00:54:44.147
OUR WAY.

00:54:44.214 --> 00:54:46.549
WE HAD TO WORK OUR WAY.

00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:48.885
SO MY LIKENESS MY BRANDING

00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:51.421
WASN'T AN OPTION.

00:54:51.488 --> 00:54:53.289
IT WASN'T UNTIL.

00:54:53.356 --> 00:54:55.792
I WENT ON TO THE NCAA

00:54:55.859 --> 00:54:58.328
CHAMPIONSHIP AND ONE THAT

00:54:58.395 --> 00:55:00.930
PERHAPS THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY.

00:55:00.997 --> 00:55:03.633
BUT IF I COMPARE MYSELF. TO A

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:05.769
FOOTBALL ATHLETE A BASKETBALL

00:55:05.835 --> 00:55:07.404
ATHLETE.

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:09.673
OR BASEBALL ATHLETE MY LIKENESS

00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:12.642
WOULD STILL NOT ALLOW ME.

00:55:12.709 --> 00:55:15.345
THE COST OF LIVING NOR MY FAMILY.

00:55:15.412 --> 00:55:16.579
SO I'M SPEAKING TO BACK GROUP OF

00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:20.016
FOLK.

00:55:20.083 --> 00:55:23.319
THAT LOWER LEVEL MADE MAKE ME IT

00:55:23.386 --> 00:55:25.789
MADE MAJOR TYPE OF GROUP.

00:55:25.855 --> 00:55:26.289
AND LONG BEACH STATE IS

00:55:26.356 --> 00:55:28.191
DEFINITELY A MID MAJOR SPORT WE

00:55:28.258 --> 00:55:30.026
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CONTENT.

00:55:30.093 --> 00:55:31.428
WILL PUT OUR STUDENT ATHLETES

00:55:31.494 --> 00:55:33.663
PERHAPS EVEN IN A DEFICIT IN

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:35.198
THEIR FAMILIES AND THE DEFICIT

00:55:35.265 --> 00:55:37.067
FINANCIAL DEFICIT.

00:55:37.133 --> 00:55:39.035
IF CALIFORNIA SAYS.

00:55:39.102 --> 00:55:41.671
THAT WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO PASS

00:55:41.738 --> 00:55:43.339
THIS LEGISLATION.

00:55:43.406 --> 00:55:45.008
THEN THE NC A A SAYS YOU GUYS

00:55:45.075 --> 00:55:46.142
ARE NO LONGER A MEMBER OF

00:55:46.209 --> 00:55:48.712
WHATEVER VIOLATIONS THAT WE HAVE.

00:55:48.778 --> 00:55:50.880
HAVE HAVE INDULGED.

00:55:50.947 --> 00:55:51.481
WHERE THOSE ATHLETES GOING TO

00:55:51.548 --> 00:55:53.349
CALL?

00:55:53.416 --> 00:55:54.284
THE PUT THEIR FAMILIES IN THE

00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:55.819
SITUATION WHICH THEY HAVE TO

00:55:55.885 --> 00:55:57.654
LOOK FURTHER.

00:55:57.721 --> 00:55:59.522
OUT OF STATE USING OUT OF STATE

00:55:59.589 --> 00:56:01.124
COSTS.

00:56:01.191 --> 00:56:03.993
SO I JUST WANTED.

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:05.261
TO HAVE YOU THINK ABOUT THAT

00:56:05.328 --> 00:56:07.764
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T BELIEVE.

00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:08.965
THAT ATHLETES SHOULD BE

00:56:09.032 --> 00:56:10.400
COMPENSATED. FOR THEIR OWN

00:56:10.467 --> 00:56:12.035
LIKENESS.

00:56:12.102 --> 00:56:13.937
I'M AN ATHLETE.

00:56:14.003 --> 00:56:14.537
THROUGH AND THROUGH I BELIEVE

00:56:14.604 --> 00:56:16.106
THAT.

00:56:16.172 --> 00:56:18.742
BUT JUST NOT IN THIS MANNER.

00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:20.343
PERHAPS MAYBE NOT NECESSARILY AT

00:56:20.410 --> 00:56:23.379
THE STATE MANA BUT MAYBE.

00:56:23.446 --> 00:56:26.549
MAYBE AT THE NCAA.

00:56:26.616 --> 00:56:28.218
AND LET'S NOT PUT A TORCH ON IN

00:56:28.284 --> 00:56:31.988
CA AND THEN WE'D BE CASUALTIES.

00:56:32.055 --> 00:56:33.022
LOW KICK FROM LOS ANGELES.

00:56:33.089 --> 00:56:37.694

AND THE POSSIBILITIES BEING FAR

00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:44.527
MORE LIMITED THAN OPPORTUNITIES

SERIOUS CONVERSATION ABOUT A HOW

01:05:50.913 --> 01:05:53.316
THE NC A A AND BY THE WAY I

01:05:53.382 --> 01:05:55.151
THINK THE NCAA IS ACTUALLY A

01:05:55.217 --> 01:05:56.819
MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION YES

01:05:56.886 --> 01:05:59.388
COMPRISED OF THE SCHOOLS AND SO

01:05:59.455 --> 01:06:01.223
IN MY MIND.

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:02.625
JUST LIKE A UNION.

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:04.160
THE SCHOOLS ACTUALLY HAVE THE

01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:05.828
POWER IN THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE

01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:07.330
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL HAVE THE

01:06:07.396 --> 01:06:10.166
POWER IN PERSUADING THE IN CA TO

01:06:10.232 --> 01:06:12.134
REALLY THINK ABOUT.

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:13.602
THE RULINGS THAT IT WANTS TO

01:06:13.669 --> 01:06:15.438
GIVE OUT.

01:06:15.504 --> 01:06:17.206
I ALSO THINK THERE'S SOME YOU

01:06:17.273 --> 01:06:18.374
KNOW WE SHOULD KIND OF BE

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:20.042
TALKING ABOUT THAT I'VE HEARD

01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:21.077
ABOUT THIS COMPETITIVE

01:06:21.143 --> 01:06:23.412
DISADVANTAGE THAT SCHOOLS WILL

01:06:23.479 --> 01:06:24.647
FACE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:25.915
HOW OTHER SCHOOLS AND OTHER

01:06:25.981 --> 01:06:28.117
STATES WILL SORT OF POACH THESE

01:06:28.184 --> 01:06:29.885
ATHLETES AND TAKE THEM BECAUSE

01:06:29.952 --> 01:06:30.986
OF THIS RULING?

01:06:31.053 --> 01:06:32.621
AND I ACTUALLY SEE IT IN ANOTHER

01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:34.724
WAY -- I THINK THAT THERE WILL

01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:36.892
BE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE HELD

01:06:36.959 --> 01:06:39.362
BY THE SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:06:39.428 --> 01:06:40.830
WHO SAY IF YOU COME TO ONE OF

01:06:40.896 --> 01:06:43.566
OUR COLLEGES WE ARE GOING?

01:06:43.632 --> 01:06:46.135
TO WE HAVE THIS STRUCTURE SET UP

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:47.670
IN PLACE.

01:06:47.737 --> 01:06:50.706
WHERE -- IF IF YOU ARE ABLE TO

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:52.475
BENEFIT OFF OF YOUR LIKENESS IN

01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:53.709
YOUR IMAGE YOU CAN.

01:06:53.776 --> 01:06:55.778
MANY OF THE YOUNG FOLKS NOWADAYS

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:59.749
ARE TRYING TO FIND WAYS -- TO

01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:01.951
EARN ADDITIONAL REVENUE -- AND

01:07:02.017 --> 01:07:03.486
TO BENEFIT FROM THEIR BRANDING I

01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:05.254
CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT IN CA

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:07.223
DOUBLE AGE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE

01:07:07.289 --> 01:07:10.726
AND HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DECIDE

01:07:10.793 --> 01:07:12.361
THAT IMAGE AND HOW IT'S USED.

01:07:12.428 --> 01:07:14.430
AND I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS

01:07:14.497 --> 01:07:18.234
BECAUSE THE NCA A IS SAYING WELL

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.869
YOU KNOW IF WE ALLOW THESE

01:07:19.935 --> 01:07:21.404
ATHLETES TO BENEFIT AND HAVE

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:23.139
THIS COMPENSATION THEN WE ARE

01:07:23.205 --> 01:07:24.573
GOING TO LOSE VIEWERS WERE GONNA

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.275
LOSE REVENUE.

01:07:26.342 --> 01:07:27.710
BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:28.344
WATCH BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:29.245
SAY THESE ARE BECAUSE I

01:07:29.311 --> 01:07:32.014
PROFESSIONALS.

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:33.883
YOU KNOW IN MY MIND THAT SORT OF

01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:38.687
I CAN TO SORT OF PRICE GOUGING --

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:41.390
AND SO I JUST HAVE SIRIUS SIRIUS

01:07:41.457 --> 01:07:44.059
CONCERNS AND I AM HOPEFUL JUST

01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:45.628
LIKE I HEARD SENATOR PAN SAY

01:07:45.694 --> 01:07:47.129
THAT WE CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS

01:07:47.196 --> 01:07:48.664
ABOUT HOW OUR SCHOOLS ARE

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:50.633
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE HELPING AND

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:51.934
SUPPORTING THE STUDENTS.

01:07:52.001 --> 01:07:54.203
RATHER THAN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:07:54.270 --> 01:07:55.671
YOU KNOW HOW TO SORT OF A BITE

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:57.206
BY ARBITRARY DECISIONS COMING

01:07:57.273 --> 01:07:59.909
FROM THE NCAA AS IT RELATES TO

01:07:59.975 --> 01:08:00.509
THEIR OWN ABILITY TO MAKE NEW

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:02.077
REVENUE.

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:03.245
AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS

01:08:03.312 --> 01:08:07.750
BILL.

EVERYBODY WANTS TO DO THE RIGHT

01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:40.816
THING FOR OUR STUDENTS BUT

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:41.417
PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.486
PERSPECTIVES BASED ON KIND OF

01:08:43.552 --> 01:08:45.054

EDUCATION AND THAT YOU KNOW

SOMEONE WITH A DAUGHTER YOU KNOW

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:40.235
THAT SAD THAT SHE MAY END UP

01:10:40.302 --> 01:10:41.403
BEING AN ATHLETE WHO DOESN'T

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:43.305

01:10:45.007 --> 01:10:46.642
CONVERSATION AND THIS BILL IS

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:48.877

01:12:41.857 --> 01:12:44.893
IMPLEMENTED UNTIL.

01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:45.527
TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE THAT'S

01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:45.994
A QUITE A FEW YEARS.

01:12:46.061 --> 01:12:49.431
SO FROM NOW 1-220-00 WHATEVER

01:12:49.498 --> 01:12:51.333
NOT TWENTY THREE OF THE TASK

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.335
FORCE TO MAY COME UP WITH IS

01:12:53.402 --> 01:12:54.136
SOME RECOMMENDATIONS.

01:12:54.203 --> 01:13:00.943
SO I WONDER WHY -- WE TRY TO

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:04.646
CONFRONT WITH THE NC DOUBLE A

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:07.416
AND A PUT THE ATHLETES IN FACT

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:09.852
THE IN JEOPARDY OF THE FUTURE

01:13:09.918 --> 01:13:11.186
POTENTIAL.

01:13:11.253 --> 01:13:13.956
IN ALL OF POLL BECAUSE ONCE YOU

01:13:14.022 --> 01:13:17.292
VIOLATE UP FROM MY UNDERSTANDING

01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:19.495
IS THAT THE OLD THE BED THE FROM

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:19.995
JOINING.

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:22.498
IN A FEW JOKES IN ALL PROTEINS.

01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:29.037
SO WHAT YOUR INTENT IS SAW.

01:13:29.104 --> 01:13:31.073
NOT SO WELL KNOWN.

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.108
I SUPPORTED THE BECAUSE OF THE

01:13:33.175 --> 01:13:37.880
THE THE THE FIRST STEP IS -- TO

01:13:37.946 --> 01:13:40.182
TO I AM NOT IN THE COME UP WITH

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:42.050
THE A WORK BURKE AGREEMENT WITH

01:13:42.117 --> 01:13:43.185
THE NC DOUBLE A RATHER THAN JUST

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:44.486
A PUSHING.

01:13:44.553 --> 01:13:48.457
AND OF FIGHT AND UP BUT THE

01:13:48.524 --> 01:13:53.729
ATHLETES SO IN IN THE JEOPARDY --

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:54.296
THROUGH THE CHAIR IF I COULD

01:13:54.363 --> 01:13:57.166
RESPOND -- A COUPLE THINGS FIRST

01:13:57.232 --> 01:13:58.634
THERE WAS A VERY -- A VERY

01:13:58.700 --> 01:13:59.168
LIVELY AND I THOUGHT VERY

01:13:59.234 --> 01:14:00.369
PRODUCTIVE EXCHANGE AT THE

01:14:00.435 --> 01:14:00.936
SENATE ED COMMITTEE BETWEEN

01:14:01.003 --> 01:14:01.904
DOCTOR PAN AND THE

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:03.405
REPRESENTATIVES OF COLLEGES

01:14:03.472 --> 01:14:05.207
WHERE HE ASTOR BERRIES REPRESENT

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:07.609
OF THE COLLEGES.

01:14:07.676 --> 01:14:09.945
WHAT IS THE BOARD OF THE NCQA

01:14:10.012 --> 01:14:12.781
ART AREN'T YOU THE NC TWO WAY?

01:14:12.848 --> 01:14:14.783
AND THEY SAID YES IT IS MADE UP

01:14:14.850 --> 01:14:15.651
OF COLLEGES.

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:17.853
AND SO IT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.188
RIGHT NOW THAT THE NC TO A IS

01:14:19.254 --> 01:14:20.956
THREATENING CALIFORNIA AND WE

01:14:21.023 --> 01:14:22.758
HAVE REPRESENTATIVES OF OUR

01:14:22.825 --> 01:14:24.092
COLLEGES COMING.

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:25.594
BECAUSE OF THIS CONCERN OF THAT

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:27.129
THREAT BUT IT IS COLLEGES

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:28.697
THREATENING THEMSELVES BECAUSE

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:32.000
THE NC TWO EIGHT IS COLLEGES NOW.

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:33.535
THE NC TWO EIGHT TRIES TO HIDE

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:34.570
BEHIND THAT.

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:36.471
AND YET THE COLLEGES THEMSELVES

01:14:36.538 --> 01:14:39.408
COULD PLAY A STRONG ROLE IN

01:14:39.474 --> 01:14:41.009
CHANGING THESE RULES.

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:43.178
THE SP TWO OH SIX IS NOT THE

01:14:43.245 --> 01:14:45.080
VERY FIRST CONVERSATION AROUND

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:47.482
THIS ISSUE THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN

01:14:47.549 --> 01:14:50.385
DOMINATING DISCUSSIONS WITH IN

01:14:50.452 --> 01:14:53.455
COLLEGE ATHLETICS FOR YEARS.

01:14:53.522 --> 01:14:54.823
AND THERE WAS PREVIOUS

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:56.225
LEGISLATION THAT CALIFORNIA

01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:59.761
LOOKED AT BACK AS EARLY AS I

01:14:59.828 --> 01:15:01.663
BELIEVE.

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:03.265
TWO THOUSAND NOW EACH TIME THE

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:05.000
COLLEGES SAID YOU CAN'T PUT US

01:15:05.067 --> 01:15:06.869
AT A DISADVANTAGE THE NC TO A

01:15:06.935 --> 01:15:09.004
MAY RETALIATE IN THE NC TO A

01:15:09.071 --> 01:15:10.439
WILL CHANGE THEIR RULES.

01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:12.574
THE NC TO A HAS ONLY MINIMALLY

01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:14.943
CHANGE THEIR RULES AND THE RULES

01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:16.311
THEY HAVE CHANGE THUS FAR

01:15:16.378 --> 01:15:19.181
LITERALLY ONLY BENEFIT ELITE

01:15:19.248 --> 01:15:20.315
MALE ATHLETES.

01:15:20.382 --> 01:15:23.418
SO WE HEAR NOW THE CONCERN.

01:15:23.485 --> 01:15:24.720
WHICH I TOTALLY SHARE THIS

01:15:24.786 --> 01:15:27.422
CONCERN THAT ARE FEMALE ATHLETES

01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:29.191
ARE PUT AT SUCH A DISADVANTAGE.

01:15:29.258 --> 01:15:31.593
BUT IN FACT THINK ABOUT IT FOR A

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:32.828
MOMENT.

01:15:32.895 --> 01:15:35.030
THE VERY RULE OF IN SITU WAY

01:15:35.097 --> 01:15:37.666
THAT DENIES ANY WOMAN COLLEGE

01:15:37.733 --> 01:15:39.334
STUDENT FROM MARKETING HERSELF.

01:15:39.401 --> 01:15:42.204
BASICALLY SERVES TO NOT ONLY

01:15:42.271 --> 01:15:45.173
HURT HER BUT HURT THE ENTIRE

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:48.043
POSSIBILITY OF FEMALE ATHLETES

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:49.811
IN FEMALE SPORTS BECOMING A

01:15:49.878 --> 01:15:50.946
BIGGER.

01:15:51.013 --> 01:15:53.782
A BIGGER FORCE WITHIN OUR

01:15:53.849 --> 01:15:55.651
ECONOMIC MARKET PLACE AND OUR

01:15:55.717 --> 01:15:56.652
CULTURE.

01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:58.854
AND YET THESE WOMEN ARE THEIR

01:15:58.921 --> 01:16:01.690
ONLY TIME OF REALLY BEING ABLE

01:16:01.757 --> 01:16:03.458
TO BE IN THE LIMELIGHT IS DURING

01:16:03.525 --> 01:16:04.760
COLLEGE BECAUSE THERE'S SO FEW

01:16:04.826 --> 01:16:07.496
PRO OPPORTUNITIES SO LET'S TAKE

01:16:07.562 --> 01:16:09.064
COURT CAITLYN OR HOW SHE FOR A

01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:11.133
MOMENT.

01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:12.234
THE UCLA GYMNAST.

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:13.535
SHE HAS IF YOU LOOK ON YOUTUBE

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:15.737
MILLIONS OF YOU TO VIEWERS

01:16:15.804 --> 01:16:18.607
MILLIONS NOW ANY OTHER STUDENTS

01:16:18.674 --> 01:16:20.108
COULD MARKET THEMSELVES WITH

01:16:20.175 --> 01:16:22.711
THOSE MILLIONS OF YOUTUBE YOURS.

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:25.380
AND BE ABLE TO MONETIZE IT SHE

01:16:25.447 --> 01:16:26.982
CANNOT.

01:16:27.049 --> 01:16:29.151
WILL SHE BE ABLE TO GO PRO AFTER

01:16:29.217 --> 01:16:32.354
THE POSSIBILITY IS VERY IS LOW

01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:34.389
IT'S POSSIBLE BUT LOW.

01:16:34.456 --> 01:16:37.125
I'M YET SHE COULD UNDER THESE

01:16:37.192 --> 01:16:39.294
RULES SHE COULD HAVE

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:39.594
[inaudible]

01:16:39.661 --> 01:16:42.531
POTENTIALLY MONETIZED THAT THE

01:16:42.597 --> 01:16:44.366
PHENOMENAL YOU TO VIEWERS THAT

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:46.201
SHE GOT WE HEARD FROM ERIN

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.070
CAFARO AS A ROWER SHE DIDN'T

01:16:48.136 --> 01:16:49.771
EVEN GET A SCHOLARSHIP UNTIL HER

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:51.707
SENIOR YEAR AND ONLY A PARTIAL

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:52.941
SCHOLARSHIP.

01:16:53.008 --> 01:16:55.277
DURING THE TIME THAT SHE WAS

01:16:55.344 --> 01:16:56.778
ROWING FOR CAL.

01:16:56.845 --> 01:16:58.947
AND BEING LOOKED AT AS A

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:00.449
POTENTIAL OLYMPIC ATHLETE WHO

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:02.784
SHE LATER BECAME AND WAS A GOLD

01:17:02.851 --> 01:17:03.752
MEDAL STARK.

01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:06.388
WE WE CANNOT RIGHT NOW SIT HERE

01:17:06.455 --> 01:17:08.256
AND SAY THAT THERE WAS NO ONE

01:17:08.323 --> 01:17:09.758
WHO MIGHT HAVE SPONSORED HER.

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:11.326
HER LOCAL QANTAS CLUB OR ROTARY

01:17:11.393 --> 01:17:13.161
CLUB MIGHT HAVE BEEN WILLING TO

01:17:13.228 --> 01:17:14.629
SPONSOR HER WHEN SHE DID NOT

01:17:14.696 --> 01:17:17.132
HAVE A SCHOLARSHIP AND HELP HER

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:18.867
COVER HER COSTS.

01:17:18.934 --> 01:17:22.270
BUT THAT IS DENIED SO.

01:17:22.337 --> 01:17:25.240
I SAY THAT THE NC TO A IN THERE

01:17:25.307 --> 01:17:26.241
MAKING THESE THREATS TO

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:27.676
CALIFORNIA.

01:17:27.743 --> 01:17:30.245
IS PUTTING THIS CHILLING EFFECT

01:17:30.312 --> 01:17:31.680
AND COULD CAUSE SOME OF YOU FILL

01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:32.614
UP WE CAN'T CHANGE THE RULES.

01:17:32.681 --> 01:17:35.450
BUT IN FACT THIS BILL IS

01:17:35.517 --> 01:17:37.619
DESIGNED TO GIVE NC TWO WAY TO

01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:39.688
CHANGE THE RULES AND TO GIVE OUR

01:17:39.755 --> 01:17:41.323
CALIFORNIA COLLEGES.

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:43.592
THE ABILITY TO ADVOCATE FOR OUR

01:17:43.658 --> 01:17:47.062
STUDENTS. TO ADVOCATE FOR OUR

01:17:47.129 --> 01:17:49.431
STUDENTS AND IF YOU LOOK AT

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:50.565
THERE WAS A TWITTER STORM

01:17:50.632 --> 01:17:52.200
YESTERDAY.

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:54.136

DE UM COMMISSION OR TASK FORCE

01:18:10.986 --> 01:18:12.854
THAT THE OF STARTED WAS

01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:14.790

FACT THAT SB TWO OH SIX PASSED

01:24:31.466 --> 01:24:32.033
PERHAPS THEY IMAGINE THEY MIGHT

01:24:33.968 --> 01:24:35.970
WITH THE THE NC TO A WORKING

01:24:36.037 --> 01:24:37.939
GROUP YOU KNOW THEIR

01:24:38.006 --> 01:24:38.573
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE COMING OUT

01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:41.142
IN OCTOBER -- WE'VE BEEN TOLD

01:24:41.209 --> 01:24:42.477
THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:44.379
RECOMMENDED POLICY CHANGES

01:24:44.446 --> 01:24:46.281
AROUND THESE ISSUES -- GIVEN

01:24:46.347 --> 01:24:48.116
THERE'S A DELAY TILL TWENTY

01:24:48.183 --> 01:24:48.883
TWENTY THREE IMPLEMENTATION.

01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:50.618
WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NOT

01:24:50.685 --> 01:24:52.220
HARM IN PUSHING THIS

01:24:52.287 --> 01:24:53.488
CONVERSATION BACK INTO EARLY

01:24:53.555 --> 01:24:54.656
NEXT YEAR TO SEE WHAT THOSE

01:24:54.722 --> 01:24:56.524
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE AND WHERE WE

01:24:56.591 --> 01:25:01.095
CAN HAVE ALIGNMENT -- BECAUSE

01:25:01.162 --> 01:25:02.797
AGAIN YOU KNOW OUR SCHOOLS.

01:25:02.864 --> 01:25:03.731
YOU KNOW IF YOUR STUDENT ATHLETE

01:25:03.798 --> 01:25:04.833
AND YOU RECEIVE COMPENSATION.

01:25:04.899 --> 01:25:05.834
I I I WOULD SAY THAT IT IS GOING

01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:06.401
TO PUT YOU IN A COMPETITIVE

01:25:06.468 --> 01:25:08.436
ADVANTAGE BECAUSE AGAIN AT THE

01:25:08.503 --> 01:25:10.271
PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

01:25:10.338 --> 01:25:11.873
EVALUATE IF YOU HAVE ONE STUDENT

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:12.907
ATHLETE BEING PAID IF YOU ALLOW

01:25:12.974 --> 01:25:14.075
THEM TO COMPETE.

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:15.243
THEIR ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR

01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:17.645
THE ENTIRE PROGRAM VACATE WINS

01:25:17.712 --> 01:25:18.279
YOU'RE AN ELIGIBLE FOR

01:25:18.346 --> 01:25:21.015
POSTSEASON PLAY -- YOU ALSO FACE

01:25:21.082 --> 01:25:22.917
YOU KNOW SCHOOLS ARE OF REQUIRED

01:25:22.984 --> 01:25:25.153
TO SELF REPORT VIOLATIONS -- AND

01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:26.654
IF YOU'RE REPEAT VIOLATOR IF YOU

01:25:26.721 --> 01:25:27.789
HAVE YOU KNOW STUDENT ATHLETES

01:25:27.856 --> 01:25:29.057
ACROSS MULTIPLE SPORTS READ YOU

01:25:29.123 --> 01:25:29.657
KNOW MULTIPLE OUTLETS IN ONE

01:25:29.724 --> 01:25:30.458
SPORT.

01:25:30.525 --> 01:25:32.427
WHO ARE AT COMPETING RECEIVES

01:25:32.494 --> 01:25:33.428
COMPENSATION YOU FACE THE

01:25:33.495 --> 01:25:34.629
POSSIBILITY OF LOS COLLAR SHIPS

01:25:34.696 --> 01:25:36.097
WHICH IS THAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR

01:25:36.164 --> 01:25:37.499
FUTURE STUDENT ATHLETES THAT ARE

01:25:37.565 --> 01:25:39.200
NOT NO LONGER AVAILABLE -- SO

01:25:39.267 --> 01:25:40.502
AGAIN FROM THAT UTILITARIAN

01:25:40.568 --> 01:25:41.836
PERSPECTIVE I THINK OUR SCHOOLS

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:43.505
ARE GOING TO FEEL AS THOUGH IF

01:25:43.571 --> 01:25:44.138
THERE IS A STUDENT ATHLETE THAT

01:25:44.205 --> 01:25:45.173
THEY KNOW IS RECEIVING

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.674
COMPENSATION FOR THE NAME IMAGE

01:25:46.741 --> 01:25:49.544
AND LIKENESS THAT STUDENT

01:25:49.611 --> 01:25:50.144
ATHLETES NOT TO BE ALLOWED TO

01:25:50.211 --> 01:25:50.912

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:51.980
IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE OTHER

01:25:52.046 --> 01:25:55.116
