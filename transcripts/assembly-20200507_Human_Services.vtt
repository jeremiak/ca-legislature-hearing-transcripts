00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:21.545
TO ADDRESS THOSE PRIVACY ISSUES

00:41:21.612 --> 00:41:23.681
THAT- COULD COME UP BECAUSE I

00:41:23.747 --> 00:41:26.116
KNOW THAT MR SANTIAGO ALSO. DID

00:41:26.183 --> 00:41:28.152
A DEAL THAT HAS SOME KIND OF

00:41:28.219 --> 00:41:30.521
GENERATIONS AND AMENDMENTS-

00:41:30.588 --> 00:41:31.922
JUST MAKING SURE THAT DOESN'T

00:41:31.989 --> 00:41:33.157
HURT SOME THE ALREADY EXISTING

00:41:33.224 --> 00:41:35.326

JUST GALLAGHER SURE SO. I

00:41:43.734 --> 00:41:47.071
MYSELF- YOUR MANY ASPECTS HAVE

00:41:47.137 --> 00:41:47.605
BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:50.875

00:41:50.941 --> 00:41:53.677
CONCERN OF MINE AS WELL- I

00:41:53.744 --> 00:41:54.511
DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANY

00:41:54.578 --> 00:41:57.114
PRIVACY CONCERNS- BY THE

00:41:57.181 --> 00:42:01.285
PRESENT BILL. IT MATCHES- WHAT

00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:04.655
LA COUNTY- LA COUNTIES PROGRAM

00:42:04.722 --> 00:42:07.958
HAS DONE- AND SO WE'RE NOT

00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:09.326
DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY THAN

00:42:09.393 --> 00:42:12.096
WHAT LA COUNTIES- PROGRAM.

00:42:12.162 --> 00:42:14.098
UNDER OUR PROPOSED. BILL THERE

00:42:14.164 --> 00:42:16.200
HAVE BEEN- ISN'T IN YOUR

00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:18.369
ANALYSIS PRIVACY COMMITTEE HAS

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:21.639
RAISED SOME CONCERNS- YEAH BUT

00:42:21.705 --> 00:42:23.274
THE AMENDMENTS THAT THEY WANT

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.708
WOULD ACTUALLY CHANGE MISTER

00:42:24.775 --> 00:42:28.212
SANTIAGO'S BILL. AND MY BILL ON

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:31.982
THE ISSUE OF CONSENT- AND THAT

00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:33.651
WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC I MEAN I

00:42:33.717 --> 00:42:35.386
I'M NOT IN A PLACE WHERE I CAN

00:42:35.452 --> 00:42:36.153
ACCEPT AMENDMENTS IS GONNA

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.756
CHANGE- A PROGRAM THAT'S

00:42:38.822 --> 00:42:40.357
ALREADY IN PLACE IN LA COUNTY

00:42:40.424 --> 00:42:41.692
AND LA COUNTY COULD PROBABLY

00:42:41.759 --> 00:42:43.460
SPEAK MORE TO THOSE CONCERNS I

00:42:43.527 --> 00:42:47.564
THINK THERE. ONE OF THE

00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:49.400
ENTITIES ITS ON THE CALL- SO

00:42:49.466 --> 00:42:50.467
MAYBE THEY COULD SPEAK MORE

00:42:50.534 --> 00:42:54.471
SPECIFICALLY TO THAT BUT- YOU

00:42:54.538 --> 00:42:56.407
KNOW I CAN'T ACCEPT AMENDMENTS

00:42:56.473 --> 00:42:57.775
THAT THEY'RE PROPOSING THAT

00:42:57.841 --> 00:42:59.910
WOULD CHANGE. WHAT THIS

00:42:59.977 --> 00:43:01.345
COMMITTEE AND LEGISLATORS

00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:02.112
ALREADY BETTER THAN APPROVED

00:43:02.179 --> 00:43:03.614

SANTIAGO'S BILL. WE'RE JUST

00:43:05.683 --> 00:43:08.319
KEEPING IT THE SAME AS WHAT HAS

FOR CLARITY THAT THAT'S NOT

00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:19.463
ENTIRELY TRUE WHAT THIS DOES.

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:20.931
IS THAT IT CREATES TWO

00:43:20.998 --> 00:43:23.067
DIFFERENT CLASSES SO THAT THERE

00:43:23.133 --> 00:43:26.403
IS AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT IF THERE

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:28.305
IS SOMEONE WHO IS AT RISK OF

00:43:28.372 --> 00:43:30.541
BEING HOMELESS FOUR BEING

THERE IS NO AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT

00:43:38.983 --> 00:43:39.583

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:43.187
