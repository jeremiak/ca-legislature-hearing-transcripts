REFERRED TO AS ALTERNATIVE

00:30:04.969 --> 00:30:05.970
ACCESS STANDARD SO THERE WERE

00:30:06.037 --> 00:30:07.839
STANDARDS ESTABLISHED MINIMUM

WHEN WE LOOKED AT THAT AND THIS

00:30:28.259 --> 00:30:29.661
IS CONSISTENT IN BOTH THOUGHT

00:30:29.727 --> 00:30:31.062
IT IS. THE NUMBER OF

00:30:31.129 --> 00:30:32.330
ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS

00:30:32.397 --> 00:30:34.365
THAT WERE ACTUALLY GRANTED BY

THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

00:30:36.067 --> 00:30:37.502

SCK UPWARDS OF TEN THOUSAND

00:30:40.338 --> 00:30:41.272
DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVE ACCESS

00:30:41.339 --> 00:30:43.808
STANDARDS.THAT WERE APPROVED

ACCESS STANDARDS. THE CONCERN

00:30:52.717 --> 00:30:54.252
WE HAD WAS MANY OF THESE

00:30:54.319 --> 00:30:55.553
ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARDS

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.889
WOULD REQUIRE A BENEFICIARY TO

00:30:57.956 --> 00:31:00.725
TRAVEL SOME CASES HUNDREDS OF

00:31:00.792 --> 00:31:01.960
MILES TO ACCESS A PROVIDER

00:31:02.026 --> 00:31:04.996

00:31:13.972 --> 00:31:15.540
MAYBE TWO THREE HUNDRED MILES

00:31:15.607 --> 00:31:18.042
AWAY AND IN MANY CASES THESE

00:31:18.109 --> 00:31:19.477
LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS DON'T

00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:20.745
HAVE THE ABILITY TO DOUBLE EVEN

00:31:20.812 --> 00:31:23.481
A- MIDDLE INCOME INDIVIDUAL MAY

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:24.115
NOT WANT TO TRAVEL THREE

00:31:24.182 --> 00:31:26.818
HUNDRED MILES- TO SEEK. A CALL

00:31:26.884 --> 00:31:31.022
CARE WE REALLY HAD CONCERNS

00:31:31.089 --> 00:31:33.057
ABOUT WHY THOSE ALTERNATIVE ACT

00:31:33.124 --> 00:31:36.127
STANDARDS WERE I DID- AND UP

00:31:36.194 --> 00:31:37.729

AT THE PLAN REQUIRED. TO

00:31:47.705 --> 00:31:48.273
DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY'VE EXIST.

00:31:48.339 --> 00:31:55.847
ALL UP OPTION. ASIAN AS TO WHY

00:31:55.913 --> 00:31:57.248
AND IN MANY CASES WE SAW IT WAS

00:31:57.315 --> 00:31:59.150
BOILER PLATE FROM ONE ONE

00:31:59.217 --> 00:32:00.218
EXPLANATION TO THE NEXT

00:32:00.285 --> 00:32:01.452
DEPENDING UPON THE ALTAR OF

ACCESS STANDARDS SO WE DIDN'T

00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:04.422
SEE HEALTHCARE SERVICES. REALLY

00:32:04.489 --> 00:32:06.457
EXPECTING THE PLANS TO PROVIDE

00:32:06.524 --> 00:32:08.192
WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION AS TO

00:32:08.259 --> 00:32:10.261
WHAT DUE DILIGENCE THAT THIS

00:32:10.328 --> 00:32:11.462
PLAN GO THROUGH TO TRY TO

00:32:11.529 --> 00:32:13.564

ACCESS TO CARE AND THESE

00:32:16.534 --> 00:32:18.903
ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARDS-

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:20.371
HEALTH CARE SERVICES COULD HAVE

00:32:20.438 --> 00:32:23.041
USED THEIR CORRECTIVE ACTION

00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:23.741

THESE THESE. PLANS ON THAT SO

00:32:25.276 --> 00:32:27.378
THAT THE BENEFICIARIES WOULD

IDENTIFIED AS FAR AS WHY ARE

00:32:43.995 --> 00:32:47.699
THERE NOT ENOUGH PROVIDERS. YOU

00:32:47.765 --> 00:32:48.299
KNOW CERTAINLY FIRST RATE OUT

00:32:48.366 --> 00:32:49.667
ISSUE. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT WE

00:32:49.734 --> 00:32:50.968
IDENTIFIED HEALTH CARE SERVICES

00:32:51.035 --> 00:32:52.337
ALSO MENTIONED IS SINCE YOU

00:32:52.403 --> 00:32:55.239
HAVE TWO PLANS- SOME PROVIDERS

00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:57.241
MANY OF THE PROVIDERS ABOUT 70%

00:32:57.308 --> 00:32:59.243
WERE ONLY CONTRACTING WITH ONE

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.144
PLAN THEY WEREN'T CONTRACTING

00:33:00.211 --> 00:33:02.347
WITH BOTH- SO THERE WERE SOME

00:33:02.413 --> 00:33:04.615
DIFFERENCES AS FAR AS IN ONE

00:33:04.682 --> 00:33:06.684
PLAN AND ACCESS TO PEDIATRICIAN

00:33:06.751 --> 00:33:09.120
MAY BE RELATIVELY CLOSE UNDER

00:33:09.187 --> 00:33:10.822
ANSEM BUT UNDER HEALTH AND

00:33:10.888 --> 00:33:13.324
WELLNESS THAT PERSON MAY HAVE

00:33:13.391 --> 00:33:13.891
TO TAKE THEIR CHILD HUNDRED

00:33:13.958 --> 00:33:14.926
FIFTY MILES. NOT SO THE ISSUE

00:33:14.992 --> 00:33:15.760
IS HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN

00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:17.028
PLANS WERE REALLY HAVING TO

00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:19.630
MAKE ADDED AT A DECISION AS TO

00:33:19.697 --> 00:33:22.100
WHAT TYPE OF CARE DO I REALLY

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:23.368
NEED AND WHICH PROVIDERS GONNA

00:33:23.434 --> 00:33:24.602
BE CLOSEST FOR ME BUT BUT IT

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:27.839
WAS CERTAINLY A PROBLEM- WE DID

00:33:27.905 --> 00:33:30.108
SOME ANALYSIS USING MEDICAL

00:33:30.174 --> 00:33:33.411
BOARD DATA AND OSTEOPATHIC

00:33:33.478 --> 00:33:36.647
BOARD DATA TO DETECT ARE THERE

00:33:36.714 --> 00:33:37.415
ADDITIONAL PROVIDER IN THE

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:38.583
ROOM. THAT PERHAPS CON THING

00:33:38.649 --> 00:33:39.917
WITH THE PLAN WE DID IDENTIFY

00:33:39.984 --> 00:33:42.653
ABOUT NINETEEN HUNDRED-

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:43.388
PROVIDERS SO ONE OF OUR

00:33:43.454 --> 00:33:46.324
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT MISTER

00:33:46.391 --> 00:33:49.560
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IS WHAT THANK

00:33:49.627 --> 00:33:52.296
HEALTH CARE SERVICES NEEDS TO

00:33:52.363 --> 00:33:53.998
DO MORE NOW THIS OF ALL THE IN

00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:55.700
THE CAPITAL WITH EXPECT THESE

00:33:55.767 --> 00:33:57.468
TURNED IT STANDARDS BUT HE-

00:33:57.535 --> 00:33:58.770
INTO THAT DO ADDITIONAL ALICE

00:33:58.836 --> 00:34:00.271
TO. PROVIDE IN THE REGION ARE

00:34:00.338 --> 00:34:02.640
RELATIVELY CLOSE TO THE

00:34:02.707 --> 00:34:03.608
BENEFICIARIES THERE ARE

00:34:03.674 --> 00:34:04.342
PROTESTS BEING IN THE POOL IN

00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:11.315
THE PLAN- ARE CONTRACTING WITH

00:34:11.382 --> 00:34:12.950
THE TWO PLANS. AND WHAT WE

00:34:13.017 --> 00:34:15.153
NEED. TO PROVIDE. SERVICES

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:17.855
COULD TO RIP NOT. TO CARE FOR

00:34:17.922 --> 00:34:18.823
BENEFICIARIES SO THAT WAS THE

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:21.626
FIRST ISSUE THAT WE IDENTIFIED.

00:34:21.692 --> 00:34:22.927
THE SECOND ISSUE IS WITH

00:34:22.994 --> 00:34:24.162
RESPECT TO COMMUNICATION WITH

00:34:24.228 --> 00:34:25.663
COUNTIES SO HEALTH CARE

AWARE OF FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS

00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:29.767
REQUIRE HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO

PROVIDE MONITORING- AND HEALTH

00:34:32.804 --> 00:34:33.438
CARE SERVICES DOES DO THAT THEY

MONITOR THROUGH HE THIS- WHICH

00:34:36.207 --> 00:34:36.774
I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH

00:34:36.841 --> 00:34:38.009
AND THEY ALSO DO MEDICAL AUDIT

00:34:38.075 --> 00:34:40.211
REPORTS- WHICH LOOK AT

00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:41.512
UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT CASE

00:34:41.579 --> 00:34:43.548
MANAGEMENT. THE AVAILABILITY OF

00:34:43.614 --> 00:34:46.184

MANAGEMENT THE ORGANIZATIONAL

00:34:47.452 --> 00:34:49.754
CAPACITY- THEY CONDUCT THESE

00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:51.389
AUDITS THEY ISSUE THESE AUDITS

00:34:51.456 --> 00:34:53.024
BUT THEY DON'T SHARE THE

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:54.659
RESULTS WITH THE COUNTIES THEY

00:34:54.725 --> 00:34:55.827

00:34:55.893 --> 00:34:57.128
INFORMATION HEALTHCARE SERVICES

00:34:57.195 --> 00:34:59.464
ON THE WEBSITE AND THEN IT'S UP

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:01.365
TO THE COUNTY TO BE PROACTIVE

00:35:01.432 --> 00:35:03.034
AND BE LOOKING FOR- CALL

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:04.635
REPORTS A LOT OF REPORTS THAT

00:35:04.702 --> 00:35:06.204
MAY BE PERTINENT TO THEIR

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:07.638
PARTICULAR COUNTY. WE THANK

00:35:07.705 --> 00:35:08.773
HEALTH CARE SERVICES NEEDS TO

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.508
BE A BETTER JOB OF

00:35:10.575 --> 00:35:12.276
COMMUNICATING THAT INFORMATION

00:35:12.343 --> 00:35:14.946
TO THE COUNTIES PRO ACTIVELY-

00:35:15.012 --> 00:35:16.614
AND MORE TOPICALLY WHAT THEIR

00:35:16.681 --> 00:35:20.017
DEPARTMENT- WAS DOING. IS WHEN

00:35:20.084 --> 00:35:21.285
THEY WOULD COMPLETE MEDICAL

00:35:21.352 --> 00:35:22.920
AUDIT REPORT THEN THAT PLAN

00:35:22.987 --> 00:35:24.655
WOULD HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER CRAP

00:35:24.722 --> 00:35:25.223
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN WITH

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:28.326
RESPECT ANY CHOOSE OUR FINDINGS

00:35:28.392 --> 00:35:29.727
THEY WOULD WAIT UNTIL THAT

00:35:29.794 --> 00:35:31.295
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN WAS

00:35:31.362 --> 00:35:33.130
COMPLETED BEFORE THE POST THE

00:35:33.197 --> 00:35:34.031
MEDICAL OUR REPORT ON THE

00:35:34.098 --> 00:35:35.032
WEBSITE WE SHOULD GET THE

00:35:35.099 --> 00:35:36.701
MEDICAL OUT REPORT UP THERE AND

00:35:36.767 --> 00:35:37.902
THEN WHEN THE CORRECTIVE AT THE

00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:38.536
PLANT. THEN YOU CAN ALSO POST

00:35:38.603 --> 00:35:40.037
THAT GET THAT INFORMATION OUT

00:35:40.104 --> 00:35:41.772
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE ON YOUR

00:35:41.839 --> 00:35:46.544
WEBSITE. BUT ALSO BE MORE

00:35:46.611 --> 00:35:47.178
PROACTIVE IN COMMUNICATING WITH

00:35:47.245 --> 00:35:50.281
THE COUNTIES. WHEN WE TALK TO

00:35:50.348 --> 00:35:50.848
SOME OF THE COUNTIES SOME

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:51.482
WEREN'T FULLY AWARE OF ALL THE

00:35:51.549 --> 00:35:52.083
DIFFERENT TYPES OF MONITORING

00:35:52.149 --> 00:35:53.017
THAT HEALTH CARE SERVICES DOES-

00:35:53.084 --> 00:35:54.919
AND CERTAINLY DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

00:35:54.986 --> 00:35:55.987
HEALTH CARE SERVICES WAS

00:35:56.053 --> 00:35:57.355
CONDUCTING THESE MEDICAL AUDITS

00:35:57.421 --> 00:35:58.656
AND THOSE COUNTIES FELT THAT

00:35:58.723 --> 00:35:59.790
THAT INFORMATION WOULD BE

00:35:59.857 --> 00:36:01.125
BENEFICIAL TO THEM AS THEY TRY

00:36:01.192 --> 00:36:02.894
TO ASSIST BENEFICIARIES. WITH

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.395
RESPECT TO THEIR RIGHTS

00:36:04.462 --> 00:36:06.864
ETCETERA ACCESS TO CARE QUALITY

00:36:06.931 --> 00:36:08.065
OF CARE THOSE SORTS OF THINGS.

00:36:08.132 --> 00:36:09.433
SO THAT'S THE SECOND ISSUE

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:10.568
REALLY NEED TO STRENGTHEN THEIR

00:36:10.635 --> 00:36:12.203
COMMUNICATION WITH THE COUNTIES

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:13.905
WITH RESPECT TO QUALITY OF CARE

00:36:13.971 --> 00:36:15.907
AND DEFICIENCIES. THAT THEY ARE

00:36:15.973 --> 00:36:17.542
IDENTIFYING WHEN THEY CONDUCT

00:36:17.608 --> 00:36:19.744
THESE AUDITS AND CERTAINLY. THE

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.746
HE IS RESULTS THOSE.

00:36:21.812 --> 00:36:24.282
EFFECTIVENESS RESULTS. THE LAST

00:36:24.348 --> 00:36:26.717
ISSUE WAS REAP WITH RESPECT TO.

00:36:26.784 --> 00:36:28.719
ASSISTING IN EDUCATING COUNTIES

00:36:28.786 --> 00:36:29.954
WHEN THE TRANSITION WAS

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:31.589
HAPPENING SO THIS WAS BACK IN

00:36:31.656 --> 00:36:33.991
TWENTY THIRTEEN- WE FELT THAT

00:36:34.058 --> 00:36:35.760
THE EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATED THAT

00:36:35.826 --> 00:36:36.794
HEALTH CARE SERVICES DIDN'T

00:36:36.861 --> 00:36:38.195
REALLY ACTIVELY ENGAGE WITH THE

00:36:38.262 --> 00:36:40.131
COUNTIES. NOW THEY DID HAVE

00:36:40.197 --> 00:36:40.998
SOME OPEN MEETINGS THEY HAD

00:36:41.065 --> 00:36:42.166
SOME DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:43.734
COUNTIES. BUT THEY DIDN'T DO

00:36:43.801 --> 00:36:45.069
WHAT WE FELT WOULD BE

00:36:45.136 --> 00:36:46.203
DEMONSTRATING LEADERSHIP AND

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:47.405
REALLY EDUCATING THE COUNTIES

00:36:47.471 --> 00:36:48.873
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.409
COUNTY COAST PLAN OR WHAT WOULD

00:36:51.475 --> 00:36:53.511
THE STEPS BE REQUIRED TO DO

00:36:53.578 --> 00:36:55.246
THAT WATER ALL YOUR OPTIONS AS

00:36:55.313 --> 00:36:56.113
A COUNTY. SOME OF THESE

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.015
COUNTIES DIDN'T HAVE.

00:36:58.082 --> 00:36:59.784
ESSENTIALLY THE EXPERTISE TO

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:01.252
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE BEST

00:37:01.319 --> 00:37:02.620
DECISION FOR THE BENEFICIARIES

00:37:02.687 --> 00:37:04.589
IN OUR REGION SO WE REALLY FELT

00:37:04.655 --> 00:37:05.990
HEALTHCARE SERVICES COULD HAVE

00:37:06.057 --> 00:37:07.024
DONE A BETTER JOB SHOULD HAVE

00:37:07.091 --> 00:37:08.693
DONE A BETTER JOB. IN

00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:09.961
COMMUNICATING WITH THE COUNTIES

00:37:10.027 --> 00:37:11.529
EARLY ON SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE

00:37:11.596 --> 00:37:12.997
INFORMED DECISIONS AS TO

00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:15.199
WHETHER OR NOT A MULTI COUNTY

00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:17.768
CODES MADE SENSE- SOME OF THE-

00:37:17.835 --> 00:37:18.569
SKEWS ME SOME OF THE COUNTIES

00:37:18.636 --> 00:37:22.073
WERE ABLE TO. JOIN PARTNERSHIP

00:37:22.139 --> 00:37:25.242
HEALTH WHICH IS. A CODE. THERE

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:26.744
WERE A HANDFUL OF THOSE THOSE

00:37:26.811 --> 00:37:27.311
COUNTY ACTUALLY TV DISTANCE

00:37:27.378 --> 00:37:29.146
NONPROFIT AND HELPING THEM

00:37:29.213 --> 00:37:30.081
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY NEEDED TO

00:37:30.147 --> 00:37:31.549
DO TO APPROACH PARTNERSHIP

00:37:31.616 --> 00:37:33.584
HEALTH. AND TO BE ABLE TO

00:37:33.651 --> 00:37:35.286
BECOME PART OF THAT CODES BUT

00:37:35.353 --> 00:37:36.754
NOT ALL OF THE COUNTIES HAD

00:37:36.821 --> 00:37:40.825
THAT KIND OF ASSISTANCE SO WE

00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:41.425
FELT THAT HEALTH CARE SERVICES

00:37:41.492 --> 00:37:44.528
NEEDED TO BE. DEMONSTRATE MORE

00:37:44.595 --> 00:37:45.062
OF A LEADERSHIP ROLE WITH

00:37:45.129 --> 00:37:45.930
RESPECT TO THE TRANSITION. AND

00:37:45.997 --> 00:37:47.064
THE REASON WE REALLY WANTED TO

00:37:47.131 --> 00:37:49.166
EMPHASIZE THIS IS SIMILAR TO

00:37:49.233 --> 00:37:51.035
WHAT YOU SAID DR PAN. THERE THE

00:37:51.102 --> 00:37:52.303
TWO HEALTH PLANS IN THE

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.171
REGIONAL MODEL RIGHT NOW HEALTH

00:37:54.238 --> 00:37:55.640
AND WELLNESS IT EXPIRES AND

00:37:55.706 --> 00:37:56.741
TWENTY TWENTY SO I KNOW. HEALTH

00:37:56.807 --> 00:37:58.743
CARE SERVICES IS AN R. F. P. IN

00:37:58.809 --> 00:38:00.678
GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS-

00:38:00.745 --> 00:38:03.047
ANTHEM HEALTH THAT EXPIRES IN

00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:03.614
TWENTY TWENTY THREE WHICH A

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:05.816
LITTLE FURTHER OUT. BUT STILL-

00:38:05.883 --> 00:38:06.851
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE

00:38:06.917 --> 00:38:08.219
DEPARTMENT HEALTHCAE SERVICES

00:38:08.285 --> 00:38:09.587
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO REALLY

00:38:09.654 --> 00:38:11.288
WORK WITH. THESE COUNTIES

00:38:11.355 --> 00:38:14.458
BECAUSE SOME OF THESE CAMPS

00:38:14.525 --> 00:38:16.694
HAVE REALLY EXPRESSED INTEREST

00:38:16.761 --> 00:38:17.261
IN EITHER DEVELOPING A MULTI

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:20.164
COUNTY. WAS. UP WITH. OUR TYPE

00:38:20.231 --> 00:38:20.931
MODEL- BECAUSE WHAT THEY

00:38:20.998 --> 00:38:21.499
CURRENTLY HAVE IS JUST NOT

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:22.933
WORKING WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.402
TO CARE. AND CERTAINLY NOT

00:38:24.468 --> 00:38:26.437
QUALITY OF CARE WHEN WE LOOKED

00:38:26.504 --> 00:38:26.971
AT SOME OF THE HEAT IS OUR

00:38:27.038 --> 00:38:29.373
RESULTS. SO WE MADE SOME

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:30.007
RECOMMENDATIONS TO HEALTH CARE

00:38:30.074 --> 00:38:32.677
SERVICES THAT THEY- THIS TIME

00:38:32.743 --> 00:38:33.778
AROUND THEY NEED TO BE MORE

00:38:33.844 --> 00:38:35.780
PROACTIVE WORKING WITH. THE

00:38:35.846 --> 00:38:37.381
COUNTIES IF THERE'S A NEED FOR

00:38:37.448 --> 00:38:40.084
ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO. HAVE

00:38:40.151 --> 00:38:41.085
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:42.720
LEGISLATURE BUT REALLY STARTING

00:38:42.787 --> 00:38:46.290
NOW. REALLY SINCE ONE OF THE

00:38:46.357 --> 00:38:48.325
PLANS EXPIRES ON THE CONTRACT

00:38:48.392 --> 00:38:50.494
EXPIRES NEXT YEAR SO I REALLY

00:38:50.561 --> 00:38:51.829
STEPPING IT UP AS FAR AS THE

00:38:51.896 --> 00:38:53.464
ASSISTANCE TO THOSE THOSE RURAL

00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:56.233
COUNTIES- SO THOSE WERE THE

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.202
THREE HIGH LEVEL KEY ISSUES-

00:38:58.269 --> 00:38:59.570
SUMMER COBBS GONNA STEP YOU

00:38:59.637 --> 00:39:00.471
THROUGH. THE MAIN

00:39:00.538 --> 00:39:01.806
RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAD SOME

ENDED UP IN THIS REGIONAL MODEL

00:44:23.193 --> 00:44:24.528
BUT IT WAS REALLY LOOKING AT

00:44:24.595 --> 00:44:25.763
STRUCTURE ACCESS TO CARE

00:44:25.829 --> 00:44:27.364
QUALITY OF CARE WE DID NOT LOOK

AT BEHAVIORAL. HEALTH CARE ALL

00:44:29.333 --> 00:44:32.603
RIGHT AND- I REALIZE IS A

00:44:32.669 --> 00:44:33.904
LITTLE BIT HISTORICAL AND I

00:44:38.742 --> 00:44:41.512
THE CHEVY STATION THIS TO WHY

00:44:41.578 --> 00:44:43.614
WE- CHOSE I WAS IN THE

00:44:44.815 --> 00:44:50.988
IDEAS BUT- WHY. IT WAS DECIDED

00:44:51.055 --> 00:44:56.593
TO PURSUE THAT PARTICULAR REACH.

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.194
WAS THAT PART OF I DON'T KNOW

THERE THERE'S AN ONGOING EFFORT

00:45:02.666 --> 00:45:03.534
IN THE STATE TO BRING MANAGED

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:04.401

BECAUSE THE STATE'S USE THAT

00:45:06.136 --> 00:45:06.703
SEES IT THERE'S A BENEFIT TO IT

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:07.204
OVER THE FEE FOR SERVICE

00:45:07.271 --> 00:45:09.573
PROGRAM. OKAY ALL RIGHT IN THE

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.507
LAB RATE ANYMORE THAN THAT IS

00:45:10.574 --> 00:45:11.308
TO THE REGIONAL BUYER. THIS

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:12.676
WILL CAUSE IS ALSO A MANAGED

00:45:12.743 --> 00:45:13.977
CARE MODEL SO I MEAN THERE'S

00:45:14.044 --> 00:45:15.245
MULTIPLE MANAGED CARE MODELS.

00:45:15.312 --> 00:45:16.113
THAT'S CORRECT AND DOCTOR PAN

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.381
AS AS A MISTER MACABRE

00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:19.149
INDICATED WE WHEN WE LOOKED AS

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:21.685
I SAID THERE WERE TWENTY EIGHT-

00:45:21.752 --> 00:45:22.553
COUNTIES THAT WERE

00:45:22.619 --> 00:45:24.188
TRANSITIONING IT WAS PART OF

00:45:24.254 --> 00:45:25.589
THE EFFORT TO TRANSITION MORE

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:26.623
AND MORE COUNTIES TO MANAGE

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:27.391
CARE BECAUSE OF THE COST

00:45:27.458 --> 00:45:29.326
EFFECTIVENESS OF MANAGED CARE.

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:31.695
AND THEN WHEN WE DO DISCUSS IN

00:45:31.762 --> 00:45:33.030
THE REPORT THERE WERE SOME

00:45:33.097 --> 00:45:35.199
COUNTIES THAT WERE ABLE TO-

00:45:35.265 --> 00:45:36.066
JOINT PARTNERSHIP THERE WERE

00:45:36.133 --> 00:45:36.633
TWO COUNTIES THAT IS STEPS

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.869
THEIR OWN. CODES BUT THEN THERE

00:45:38.936 --> 00:45:40.137
WERE THESE OTHER EIGHTEEN

00:45:40.204 --> 00:45:41.472
COUNTIES THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE

00:45:41.538 --> 00:45:42.639
ABILITY TO DO THAT SOME OF THEM

00:45:42.706 --> 00:45:44.141
TRIED TO JOIN PARTNERSHIP.

00:45:44.208 --> 00:45:45.742
PARTNERSHIP REJECTED IT

00:45:45.809 --> 00:45:47.244
BECAUSE- IT HAD REACHED

00:45:47.311 --> 00:45:49.980
CAPACITY- SO WE WERE TRYING TO

00:45:50.047 --> 00:45:51.882
FIGURE OUT OKAY WHY DID THESE

00:45:51.949 --> 00:45:52.749
EIGHTEEN AND UP IN THIS

00:45:52.816 --> 00:45:55.352
REGIONAL MODEL IT WAS KIND OF

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:56.420
LIKE A LAST. ACT CHOICE OF LAST

00:45:56.487 --> 00:46:00.624
RESORT AND THAT BY WE HAVE

00:46:00.691 --> 00:46:03.927
CONCERNS. IN THE REPORT ABOUT.

00:46:03.994 --> 00:46:04.695
IS PROVIDING THAT YOUR SHIP WE

00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:05.295
THINK SHOULD HAVE PROVIDED IN

00:46:05.362 --> 00:46:05.863
THE PAST. AND THAT WE THEY

00:46:05.929 --> 00:46:06.430
SHOULD PROVIDE NOW AND GIVE

00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:06.964
THESE COUNTIES ADDITIONAL

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:08.465
OPTIONS. WITH RESPECT TO

00:46:08.532 --> 00:46:09.766
PERHAPS A MULTI COUNTY KOS

00:46:09.833 --> 00:46:11.268
MODEL THAT MAY BE BETTER FOR

00:46:11.335 --> 00:46:13.036
THE STATE. AND CERTAINLY BETTER

00:46:13.103 --> 00:46:14.571
FOR BENEFICIARIES WITH RESPECT

00:46:14.638 --> 00:46:16.039
TO ACCESS THE CARE AND QUALITY

00:46:16.106 --> 00:46:19.076
OF CARE. SO ONE COULD ARGUE

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:22.212
THAT- AM NINE REPRESENTS A

00:46:22.279 --> 00:46:23.380
COUNTY THAT HAS GEOGRAPHIC

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:25.649
MATCH CARE WE HAVE FIVE PLANS.

00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:27.851
SACRAMENTO COUNTY. WE CAN WE

00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:29.286
WON'T GET INTO THE ISSUES

00:46:29.353 --> 00:46:35.025
THERE- BUT. YES ONE QUESTION IS

00:46:35.092 --> 00:46:36.493
THAT IT'S- NOT NECESSARILY

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.428
INHERENT TO OTHER ECHOES ARE

00:46:38.495 --> 00:46:40.564
MULTI PLAN MODEL THAT YOU

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:42.199
NECESSARILY HAVE TO HAVE ACCESS

00:46:42.266 --> 00:46:43.800
ISSUES SO I'M PARTICULARLY

00:46:43.867 --> 00:46:44.801
INTERESTED IN. THE

00:46:44.868 --> 00:46:46.603
RECOMMENDATIONS YOU HAD THAT DH

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:47.905
CS SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT

00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:50.440
TO PURSUE REGARDING THE ACCESS

00:46:50.507 --> 00:46:51.408
SO I REALIZE THERE'S THE MODEL

00:46:51.475 --> 00:46:53.677
PART THAT'S THEIR DIFFERENT

00:46:53.744 --> 00:46:56.680
DYNAMICS THERE BUT- IT'S FOR

00:46:56.747 --> 00:46:59.550
EXAMPLE ENSURING THAT- PATIENTS

00:46:59.616 --> 00:47:02.619
WHO NEEDED. US USUALLY PROBABLY

00:47:02.686 --> 00:47:04.988
SPECIALTY CARES MORE LIKELY-

00:47:05.055 --> 00:47:06.590
THAT- IF THEY NEED TO GO OUT OF

00:47:06.657 --> 00:47:09.459
NETWORK THAT- IF THERE WAS AN

00:47:09.526 --> 00:47:12.996
INADEQUATE NETWORK BY THE PLAN.

00:47:13.063 --> 00:47:17.067
THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD. HELP

00:47:17.134 --> 00:47:18.101
FACILITATE THAT- SO CAN CAN USE

00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:20.637
CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE- NETWORK

00:47:20.704 --> 00:47:22.172
ISSUE SAID YOU SAID YOU LOOKED

00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:23.941
INTO FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE

00:47:24.007 --> 00:47:25.943
MANY- PHYSICIANS AND OTHER

00:47:26.009 --> 00:47:28.412
PROVIDERS TO DID NOT- WHO ARE

00:47:28.478 --> 00:47:31.448
AVAILABLE BUT YET- DID NOT

00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:32.916
CONTRACT OR ONLY CONTRACTED

00:47:32.983 --> 00:47:35.052
WITH ONE PLAN. AND CAN YOU

00:47:35.118 --> 00:47:37.020
SPEAK TO THE LEVEL EFFORT THAT

00:47:37.087 --> 00:47:42.459
THE- AGENCY MADE TO TRY TO BE

00:47:42.526 --> 00:47:44.094
SURE PEOPLE COULD GET

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:45.862
REASONABLE ACCESS AND TIMELY

00:47:45.929 --> 00:47:48.632
ACCESS. AND PERHAPS ALSO TOUCH

00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:50.701
ON YOU MENTIONED A NUMBER OF

00:47:50.767 --> 00:47:53.103
TIMES THAT THE SORT OF GAVE

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:54.571
ALTERNATE STANDARDS BUT WHAT

00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:56.006
PERCENTAGE AND IF THERE'S A

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:58.408
SENSE OF PERCENTAGES LIKE THIS

00:47:58.475 --> 00:47:58.976
HOW FREQUENTLY THIS HAPPENED

00:47:59.042 --> 00:48:03.280
BEYOND JUST. AS IT IS- IN TERMS

00:48:03.347 --> 00:48:03.814
OF THE NUMBER FOR ALL THAT

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:06.917
CENTER. WELL WITH RESPECT TO

00:48:06.984 --> 00:48:07.417
THE ALTERNATIVE ACCESS

00:48:07.484 --> 00:48:08.252
STANDARDS THAT THE DEPARTMENT

00:48:08.318 --> 00:48:10.053
GRANTED AS WE DISCUSS AND IN

00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:12.589
THE PREVIOUS AUDIT REPORT- THEY

00:48:12.656 --> 00:48:14.024
BASICALLY APPROVED EVERY

00:48:14.091 --> 00:48:15.525
ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARD

00:48:15.592 --> 00:48:16.560
REQUEST THAT THEY GOT UNLESS

00:48:16.627 --> 00:48:18.161
THE REQUEST WAS INCOMPLETE

00:48:18.228 --> 00:48:19.630
WHERE THERE WASN'T SUFFICIENT

00:48:19.696 --> 00:48:21.131
DOCUMENTATION OR THEIR IT WHAT

00:48:21.198 --> 00:48:22.633
THE APPLICATION WASN'T

00:48:22.699 --> 00:48:24.201
COMPLETE. BUT IF THEY RECEIVE A

00:48:24.268 --> 00:48:25.702
COMPLETED APPLICATION IT WAS

00:48:25.769 --> 00:48:26.837
PRETTY MUCH A THREE HUNDRED AND

00:48:26.903 --> 00:48:28.171
RUBBER STAMP OKAY I DON'T SAY

00:48:28.238 --> 00:48:29.506
THAT THE REPORT BUT WE SAY THAT

00:48:29.573 --> 00:48:31.141
THEY APPROVED ALL OF THE

00:48:31.208 --> 00:48:33.143
ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARDS-

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:35.112
THAT WERE SUBMITTED THAT WERE

00:48:35.178 --> 00:48:36.947
DEEMED COMPLETE. AND WE HAD

00:48:37.014 --> 00:48:39.516
CONCERNS WITH THAT BECAUSE-

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:40.717
THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY HOLDING

00:48:40.784 --> 00:48:42.853
THOSE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO SAY

00:48:42.919 --> 00:48:45.088
WHAT DID YOU DO TO EXHAUST ALL

00:48:45.155 --> 00:48:47.057
OPTIONS AND AN OPTION IS TO

00:48:47.124 --> 00:48:49.760
TEMPORARILY PROVIDE OUT OF. OUT

00:48:49.826 --> 00:48:53.463
OF NETWORK. FIGHTERS ACCESS- SO

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:54.064
WE THINK THAT SOMETHING THEY

00:48:54.131 --> 00:48:55.165
SHOULD DO AND WITH RESPECT TO

00:48:55.232 --> 00:48:56.867
THE ANALYSIS I MENTION THE

00:48:56.933 --> 00:48:57.901
NINETEEN HUNDRED PROVIDERS.

00:48:57.968 --> 00:49:00.237
WHAT WE DID AND I DON'T KNOW

00:49:00.304 --> 00:49:01.905
WHETHER WE SHARE IT WITH YOU

00:49:01.972 --> 00:49:02.506
WHEN WE TALK WITH YOU IN THE

00:49:02.572 --> 00:49:04.741
PAST BUT- WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN-

00:49:04.808 --> 00:49:07.311
I. T. SUPPORT GROUP AND OUR

00:49:07.377 --> 00:49:09.813
OFFICE THAT DOES ANALYTICS. SO

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.482
WHAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO-

00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:13.950
USING MEDICAL BOARD DATA AS I

00:49:14.017 --> 00:49:16.153
INDICATED AN OSTEOPATHIC BOARD

00:49:16.219 --> 00:49:18.322
DATA. IDENTIFY PROVIDERS IN THE

00:49:18.388 --> 00:49:19.823
RURAL COUNTIES THAT HAD NOT

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:22.859
CONTRACTED WITH EITHER PLANS-

00:49:22.926 --> 00:49:24.528
BUT WE ALSO WERE ABLE TO

00:49:24.594 --> 00:49:26.930
CREATE- AN INTERACTIVE MAP AS

00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:29.132
FAR AS DATA ANALYSIS SO THAT.

00:49:29.199 --> 00:49:30.867
IT WOULD BE RELATIVELY EASY FOR

00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:31.635
HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO

00:49:31.702 --> 00:49:34.237
IDENTIFY WHICH COUNTIES. ARE

00:49:34.304 --> 00:49:35.205
THERE ARE THERE ARE SOME

00:49:35.272 --> 00:49:36.073
PROVIDERS THAT ARE CONTRACTING

00:49:36.139 --> 00:49:38.675
WITH WITH EITHER PLAN REACH OUT

00:49:38.742 --> 00:49:41.211
TO THOSE PROVIDERS AND SAY WHAT

00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:44.981
IS IT GOING TO TAKE ARE THERE

00:49:45.048 --> 00:49:46.983
INCENTIVES. THAT WE CAN PROVIDE.

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:47.584
SIX TO PROVIDE PROVIDERS MORE

00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:49.586
WHAT. WE JUST THINK THAT

00:49:49.653 --> 00:49:50.987
DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES

00:49:51.054 --> 00:49:52.022
COULD BE DOING MUCH MORE

00:49:52.089 --> 00:49:54.057
ANALYSIS WE DID IT DURING THE

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:55.225
COURSE OF THE AUDIT SO I THINK

00:49:55.292 --> 00:49:57.694
THAT AS AN AGENCY THEY WOULDBE

00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:58.295
ABLE TO DO THAT. AS A STANDARD

00:49:58.362 --> 00:50:00.897
COURSE OF PRACTICE. AND DID YOU

00:50:00.964 --> 00:50:02.232
IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THE

00:50:02.299 --> 00:50:04.134
AUDIT. SO THERE'S THE NOW WE

00:50:04.201 --> 00:50:05.268
HAVE THE NETWORKS HAVE TWO

00:50:05.335 --> 00:50:06.536
PLANS THEY HAVE THEIR EXISTING

00:50:06.603 --> 00:50:09.606
NETWORKS- WERE YOU ABLE TO

00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:12.075
EXPLORE ARE ENGAGED IN THE

00:50:12.142 --> 00:50:15.045
AUDIT. LOOKING AT WHAT- HOW

00:50:15.112 --> 00:50:17.314
MUCH EFFORT THE DEPARTMENT

00:50:17.381 --> 00:50:19.082
ENGAGED IN AND BE SURE THAT THE

00:50:19.149 --> 00:50:20.484
PLANS THEMSELVES ACTUALLY HAD

00:50:20.550 --> 00:50:22.319
ADEQUATE NETWORK START WITH SO.

00:50:22.386 --> 00:50:24.187
IN THIS YEAH WE TALKED ABOUT

00:50:24.254 --> 00:50:25.455
WELL GEE THEY DON'T HAVE ONE TO

00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:28.625
GIVE THEM A WAY AROUND. BUT IS

00:50:28.692 --> 00:50:29.760
THAT THAT. HOW MUCH DID THE

00:50:29.826 --> 00:50:31.461
OVERSIGHT TO THE DEPARTMENT PUT

00:50:31.528 --> 00:50:33.997
INTO BEING SURE THAT THE

00:50:34.064 --> 00:50:36.633
NETWORK TO START WITH. ACTUALLY

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:41.405
HAD SUFFICIENT. PEOPLE WHO WERE

00:50:41.471 --> 00:50:42.539
IN. THE AND IT'S TO BASICALLY

00:50:42.606 --> 00:50:44.408
PROVIDE TIMELY ACCESS NOT JUST

00:50:44.474 --> 00:50:44.941
SOMEONE WHO IS HUNDREDS OF

00:50:45.008 --> 00:50:47.744
MILES AWAY. THE STATE STANDARDS

00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:49.012
THAT WE ADDRESS IN THE REPORT

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:50.547
ARE- FAIRLY RECENT STANDARDS I

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:51.915
BELIEVE THEY THEY WERE APPROVED

00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:53.116
IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND

00:50:53.183 --> 00:50:54.384
BECAME ACTIVE IN TWO THOUSAND

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:55.886
EIGHTEEN. WHICH WAS AFTER THE

00:50:55.952 --> 00:50:57.954
STATE- CONTRACTED WITH THE

00:50:58.021 --> 00:50:58.789
HEALTH PLANS TO PROVIDE SERVICE

00:50:58.855 --> 00:51:01.591
IN THAT REGION. SO THEY WOULD

00:51:01.658 --> 00:51:02.359
NOT HAVE BEFORE HAND BECAUSE

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:03.226
THE STANDARDS WERE TO

00:51:03.293 --> 00:51:05.328
APPLICABLE THEN OKAY AND HOW

00:51:05.395 --> 00:51:06.863
ACCURATE WERE TO PROVIDE A LIST

00:51:06.930 --> 00:51:07.831
FROM THE PLANS WHEN YOU WERE

00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:10.500
DOING THE AUDIT IS THAT IT TO

00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:12.736
ANY ISSUES IN TERMS OF ACCURACY

00:51:12.803 --> 00:51:14.371
OF THE PROVIDER. LIST NETWORK

00:51:14.438 --> 00:51:15.972
TERMS OF ACTORS THE- DURING THE

00:51:16.039 --> 00:51:17.908
COURSE OF THIS AUDIT WE DID NOT

00:51:17.974 --> 00:51:19.843
DO THAT TYPE OF ANALYSIS DR PAM

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:21.311
BUT THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE

00:51:21.378 --> 00:51:24.714
IDENTIFIED IN PREVIOUS AUDITS

00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:27.117
AND THE MOST RECENT AUDIT. THE

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:27.751
AUDIT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT A

00:51:27.818 --> 00:51:28.385
LITTLE BIT LATER WE IDENTIFIED

00:51:28.452 --> 00:51:29.853
THAT AGAIN AS AN ISSUE SOME OF

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:31.221
THOSE PROVIDER DIRECTORIES.

00:51:31.288 --> 00:51:32.889
WERE NOT ACCURATE BUT A

00:51:32.956 --> 00:51:34.357
PROVIDER MAY HAVE BEEN LISTED

00:51:34.424 --> 00:51:35.125
IN THE DIRECTORY BUT IS NOT

00:51:35.192 --> 00:51:37.694
TAKING MEDI CAL PATIENTS. OR IS

00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:39.496
NO LONGER PRACTICING SO- WE

00:51:39.563 --> 00:51:42.032
DID. THEY'RE DOING A BETTER JOB

00:51:42.098 --> 00:51:42.499
OF CLEANING UP THOSE

AND MY UNDERSTANDING OF IT

01:05:13.409 --> 01:05:17.079
THERE REALLY A FEW REASONS. ONE

01:05:17.146 --> 01:05:19.315
BEING THAT WE DID HAVE THESE

01:05:19.382 --> 01:05:19.915
TWENTY EIGHT COUNTIES THAT ARE

01:05:19.982 --> 01:05:20.449
LOOKING. MOVE INTO MANAGED

01:05:20.516 --> 01:05:25.087
CARE. THERE WERE EIGHT THAT

01:05:25.154 --> 01:05:26.022
PARTNERSHIP HEALTH PLAN WAS

01:05:26.088 --> 01:05:27.089
INTERESTED IN PUTTING IN. YOUR

01:05:27.156 --> 01:05:29.792
DESK AT THAT TIME. THE OTHER

01:05:29.859 --> 01:05:32.361
OFFICE WERE NOT THEY'RE NOT

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:38.000
CONTINUE SO. OR THEY OR THEIR

01:05:38.067 --> 01:05:43.139
FATE OR THAT THAT CODE THAT. WE

01:05:43.205 --> 01:05:44.874
THEN OF THE OF MEANING THESE

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:46.642
TEAMS ARE CONTINUOUS SO IT

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:47.743
REALLY PROVIDED A WAY TO. ADD A

01:05:47.810 --> 01:05:49.712
REGIONAL LIES MODEL. THAT ONE

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:50.279
WOULD MAKE SURE THAT HEALTH

01:05:50.346 --> 01:05:50.913
PLAN TO CHOSE WHO CHOSE TO TRY

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:51.647
TO ENTER INTO THIS AREA WOULD

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:52.648
HAVE SUFFICIENT POPULATION. TO

01:05:52.715 --> 01:05:53.549
REALLY MAINTAIN THE AND

01:05:53.616 --> 01:05:54.150
ADMINISTRATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:05:54.216 --> 01:05:54.784

01:05:55.718 --> 01:05:56.719
AS FROM THE STATE

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.921
ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE OF

I TALKED A LOT ABOUT RATE

01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:04.694
SETTING IT IS COMPLICATED AND

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.896
THE SMALLER THE NUMBERS OF

01:06:06.962 --> 01:06:08.531
INDIVIDUALS IS REALLY HARD TO

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:09.799
THEN GET ACCURATE RATES. SO IT

01:06:09.865 --> 01:06:10.833
WAS A COMBINATION OF THOSE

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.803
THINGS- AND THEN REALLY WITH

THAT YOU KNOW CERTAINLY

01:15:06.702 --> 01:15:08.403
PROCEDURES SYSTEM SOMETHING WE

01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:09.438
WANT TO BE VERY INTERESTED BUT

01:15:09.504 --> 01:15:11.707
ALSO THE STANDARDS RIGHT THE

01:15:11.773 --> 01:15:13.609
MINIMUM STANDARDS PEOPLE ARE

01:15:13.675 --> 01:15:15.110
SUPPOSED TO MEET AND ARE FOR

01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:16.845
THEM TO BE ABLE TO SENSE AGAIN

01:15:16.912 --> 01:15:19.281
NOW THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SAYING SO

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:22.985
WHAT WHAT IS IT THAT YOU

01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:26.989
ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO. BEFORE.

01:15:27.055 --> 01:15:28.757
PART IN SAYS OKAY WELL USED.

01:15:28.824 --> 01:15:30.325
LOOKS LIKE WE ARE AT AN IMPASSE

01:15:30.392 --> 01:15:31.693
AND THE ARE ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.095
TO SAY ONE TWO HUNDRED MILES OR

01:15:33.161 --> 01:15:33.962
THREE HUNDRED MILES AWAY SURE

01:15:34.029 --> 01:15:35.864
SO THE THINGS THAT I CAN SPEAK

01:15:35.931 --> 01:15:38.967
TO MORE DIRECTLY AND THEN AGAIN

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:53.715
I THINK HAPPY TO HAVEOF RATES WERE OFFERED WE DON'T

01:15:53.782 --> 01:15:57.753
HAVE A SPECIFIC STANDARD ON IT

01:15:57.819 --> 01:16:01.490
HAS TO BE THIS KIND OF RATE OR

01:16:01.556 --> 01:16:02.024
THAT THAT NOT. AS YOU KNOW

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:04.660
GREAT. FOR SERVICE AMERICA AND

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:06.762
THEIR CAP DID SO A COMPARISON

01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:11.199
TO OTHER RATES- CAN BE A

01:16:11.266 --> 01:16:15.270
CHALLENGE BUT BUT REALLY

01:16:15.337 --> 01:16:19.675
LOOKING AT WHAT OTHER WHAT

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:22.144
TYPES OF RIGHT. THEY ARE ARE

01:16:22.210 --> 01:16:23.111
THEY OFFERING WHAT THE RATE.

01:16:23.178 --> 01:16:25.213
DID THE- IF. OTHER IN THE

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:29.217
COUNTY. DETAILS BUT WOULD BUT

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:31.653
LET US HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:36.024
THAT BETTER THAN ME- THAT AND

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:37.492
THEN WE CAN HAVE A FOR A

01:16:37.559 --> 01:16:41.396
FURTHER CONVERSATION OKAY SO.

01:16:41.463 --> 01:16:45.233
THAT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT.

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.469
IS WELL WHAT. I DID RATES SEND

01:16:47.536 --> 01:16:51.206
A COW AND WE HAD THE RATE

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:52.507
SETTING HEARING AND HE KNOWS

01:16:52.574 --> 01:16:55.444
THE SAMPLE COSTA TESTIFIED

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:58.080
TODAY PAID MEDICARE RATES WERE

01:16:58.146 --> 01:17:02.718
WHEN I THINK WAS ANTHEM WHO

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:07.389
CAN'T OURS. DALY SAID THAT.

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:09.157
SOMETIMES HAS TO DO WITH THE

01:17:09.224 --> 01:17:12.160
LEVEL OF- ESSENTIALLY OVERHEAD

01:17:12.227 --> 01:17:15.230
HIM MISS MEAN BURDEN ABSOLUTELY

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:17.499
THE PLAN EXPECTS. OF THE SO

01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:21.536
WHICH OF COURSE RAISES THE COST.

01:17:21.603 --> 01:17:24.039
AT THAT CAN BE AN ISSUE AS WELL

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:25.707
THERE'S OTHER REASONS AS WELL

01:17:25.774 --> 01:17:30.445
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

01:17:30.512 --> 01:17:35.617
WE NEED- WHAT HURTS WERE TAKEN

01:17:35.684 --> 01:17:40.255
TO TRUST RATES ADDRESS. YES AND.

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:40.822
JEFF IS THAT PREVENT PEOPLE

01:17:40.889 --> 01:17:46.895
FROM CONTRACT WITH THIS PLAN SO

01:17:46.962 --> 01:17:48.730
I THINK THOSE MINIMUM STANDARDS

01:17:48.797 --> 01:17:52.034
ARE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT LIKE

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:57.773
HOW IT ASIDE FROM JUST THE

01:17:57.839 --> 01:17:58.373
PROCESS HOW THE PEOPLE REVIEW

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:06.181
IT WHAT. THIS S. A FOR NOW YOU

01:18:06.248 --> 01:18:11.820
COULD DO MORE. YOU TALKED ABOUT

01:18:11.887 --> 01:18:16.058
A REASONABLE CONTRACT. THE END

01:18:16.124 --> 01:18:18.960
A DEFINITE REASONABLE SO WHAT

01:18:19.027 --> 01:18:19.895
IS CAN YOU PROVIDE MORE

01:18:19.961 --> 01:18:21.229
SPECIFICITY IS TO WHAT'S

01:18:21.296 --> 01:18:23.932
REASONABLE AT A AT A L. I THINK

01:18:23.999 --> 01:18:26.301
WE HAVE ESTABLISHED IN THE

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:27.335
STATE STANDARDS FOR ACCESS TO

01:18:27.402 --> 01:18:31.840
CARE AT THAT WORKS CLEARLY THE-

01:18:31.907 --> 01:18:36.945
REASONS. THAT'S THAT. THE STAND

01:18:37.012 --> 01:18:41.216
ESTABLISH REASONABLE HI. YEAH

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:42.851
AND CERTAINLY I MEAN OBVIOUSLY

01:18:42.918 --> 01:18:45.287
THE ABILITY TO ALTERNATIVE

01:18:45.353 --> 01:18:47.322
ACCESS ALSO PART OF THE STATUTE

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:49.224
IT RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:52.594
GOING TO BEAT THAT MAY NOT BE

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:54.196
POSSIBLE TO BE MAD AND I THINK

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:58.066
THAT AGAIN CONTINUING IMPROVE

01:18:58.133 --> 01:19:00.902
NGUYEN BUT HOW HOW MORE OFTEN

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:05.707
DO WE REQUIRE. OUT OF NETWORK

01:19:05.774 --> 01:19:06.975
ACCESS AND THEN. BURKE ACCESS

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:11.079
ARE THOSE. DID YOU IN SO ALL

01:19:11.146 --> 01:19:11.947
ALL TOTALLY APPROPRIATE

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:14.082
QUESTIONS EIGHT I DO THINK

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:15.951
WE'VE MOVED WE'VE MOVED TO THE

01:19:16.017 --> 01:19:18.553
LINE AN IMPROVED IT BUT WE WANT

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.188
TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE IT AND I

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:22.724
WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A

01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:24.559
PARTICULAR. IS WITH YOU I THINK

01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:26.128
YOU CAN REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT

01:19:26.194 --> 01:19:28.563
I THINK SHOULD BE HOW DO WE BE

01:19:28.630 --> 01:19:31.266
MORE SPECIFIC- I'M IN FROM AN

01:19:31.333 --> 01:19:34.102
ANALYTICAL PERSPECTIVE AND LESS

01:19:34.169 --> 01:19:39.141
OF THE SUBJECTIVE PERSPECTIVE

01:19:39.207 --> 01:19:39.741
SO I. SHEET THAT IN AND HAPPY

01:19:39.808 --> 01:19:41.276
TO CONTINUE. ANYTHING RESULT

01:19:41.343 --> 01:19:41.843
IMPORTANT FOR THE PLANS AND

01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:43.745
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY. THE

01:19:43.812 --> 01:19:45.380
CONTRACTS ARE THEY HAVE TO KNOW

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:46.882
WHAT THEY'RE WHAT IT'S BEING

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:49.284
EXPECTED OF THEM AS WELL AND-

01:19:49.351 --> 01:19:51.786
AND TO WHAT DEGREE THAT THEY

SUPPER BETTER. ALL COAST PLANS

01:26:13.101 --> 01:26:15.103

MODEL IT'S HOW WE ASSESS WHAT

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:32.120
THE NEEDS OF THAT REGION ARE.

01:26:32.186 --> 01:26:33.354

01:26:37.358 --> 01:26:39.861
IN THOSE REGIONS AND THEN HOW

01:26:39.928 --> 01:26:41.329
TO BE HOLD THEM ALL CAN. BE

01:26:41.396 --> 01:26:45.800
ACCOUNTABLE TO THE STATE THAT

AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL I THINK

01:27:18.032 --> 01:27:19.500
THE WAY THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:27:19.567 --> 01:27:20.068

CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS THE

01:27:34.148 --> 01:27:37.118
HOMELESS- AND PERSONS THAT THAT

01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:39.454
UTILIZE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS A

NOT EVERYTHING A CAN'T BE

01:27:45.159 --> 01:27:48.730
EVERYTHING WITH ME DOING A LOT

01:27:48.796 --> 01:27:49.297
MORE THAN THIS RIGHT NOW IN

01:27:49.364 --> 01:27:49.897
TERMS OF LINKING. PEOPLE THAT

SURE WE- EXPAND OR- CHANGE

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.675

THAT COUNTIES COULD USE SOME

01:34:13.114 --> 01:34:16.417

01:34:16.484 --> 01:34:18.252
DIFFERENT MODELS- SOME WHICH I

01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:19.987
UNDERSTAND THE PERHAPS REQUIRED

01:34:20.054 --> 01:34:22.623
LEGISLATION IF WE WANT TO

01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:24.859

OTHER. IS AS WELL. AND EVEN WE

01:34:30.765 --> 01:34:34.168
STAYED WITH A HE'S NOT. PLAN

01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:39.707
EACH MODEL REALLY WHAT THE

01:34:39.774 --> 01:34:40.741
DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS ARE

01:34:40.808 --> 01:34:41.675
PERHAPS PROVIDING MORE

01:34:41.742 --> 01:34:43.077
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO COUNTY

01:34:43.144 --> 01:34:45.112
SO THEY CAN HAVE MORE GUIDANCE-

01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:48.783
IN IN THAT IS DO YOU SEE THAT

01:34:48.849 --> 01:34:50.151
AS BEING SOMETHING THAT THE

01:34:50.217 --> 01:34:52.053
PART HEALTHCARE SERVICES WILL

WE OBVIOUSLY TOOK. AT OF THE

01:35:16.710 --> 01:35:17.478

01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:20.781
SOMETIMES. I WISH THEY HAD A

01:35:20.848 --> 01:35:22.983

WE HAVE TAKEN NOTE OF THAT- I'M

01:35:31.158 --> 01:35:34.161
GONNA. THE OAKS ARE POOR OF IN

01:35:34.228 --> 01:35:34.762
TERMS OF THE LEGISLATURE'S IN

01:35:43.904 --> 01:35:44.438
WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS GOING TO

01:35:44.505 --> 01:35:49.009
DO. OWNERS OFFICE TO DO BUT

01:35:49.076 --> 01:35:50.711
IT'S REALLY CAMINO WE CERTAINLY

01:35:50.778 --> 01:35:53.681
HAVE NOTED THAT IT'S IT WAS A

01:35:53.747 --> 01:35:54.315

AT INTERNALLY. ALRIGHT WELL I

01:36:00.621 --> 01:36:02.823

RECORDS HAS POINTED OUT INDEED

01:36:05.693 --> 01:36:06.193

01:36:09.163 --> 01:36:10.764
PRIZE A PERCENTAGE THE ENTIRE

01:36:10.831 --> 01:36:12.867
MEDI CAL BUDGET RIGHT ABA LEAKY

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:15.803
MUCH MUCH MUCH LESS THAN THE

01:36:15.870 --> 01:36:17.671
ANNUAL VARIATION THAT MEDI CAL

01:36:17.738 --> 01:36:19.140

ALTHOUGH I KNOW WORKING HARD TO

01:36:21.242 --> 01:36:23.711
TRY AND THEIR OF THAT- BUT I

01:36:23.777 --> 01:36:26.680
THINK THAT. GIVEN SOME OF THE

01:36:26.747 --> 01:36:27.248
FINDINGS AND THE TWO AUDITS

01:36:27.314 --> 01:36:28.315

01:41:56.944 --> 01:41:58.645
WANTED TO UNDERSCORE THE TABLE

01:41:58.712 --> 01:42:00.948
THREE THAT- AS FAR AS HE TO

01:42:01.014 --> 01:42:02.850
SCORES GO TO TWENTY TWO SCORES

01:42:02.916 --> 01:42:03.484
THAT THE A CS HOLD US

01:42:03.550 --> 01:42:05.385
ACCOUNTABLE FOR. ANTHEM HAVE

01:42:05.452 --> 01:42:06.753
THE LOWEST NUMBER OF MEASURES

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:08.355
THAT WERE. BELOW MINIMUM

01:42:08.422 --> 01:42:10.224
PERFORMANCE SOME OF IT FOR HE

01:42:10.290 --> 01:42:11.625
TO STAMP POINT OUT THEM IS

01:42:11.692 --> 01:42:14.228

HEALTH AND WELLNESS. THAT WERE

01:42:21.869 --> 01:42:22.436
WERE BEING COMPETITIVE BUT I DO

01:42:22.503 --> 01:42:24.972
THE HIGHLIGHT. QUANTIFIABLE HE

01:42:25.038 --> 01:42:26.607
THIS. PERFORMANCE WHICH IS WHAT

01:42:26.673 --> 01:42:28.275
I'LL TO ACROSS THE STATE.

PLANS IN IN THE LOCAL MARKET SO

01:42:30.811 --> 01:42:31.945
I STILL QUESTION THE FACT THE

01:42:32.012 --> 01:42:32.946
QUALITY OF CARE IS NOT

01:42:33.013 --> 01:42:36.149

5% OF THE MEMBERS IN THE RURAL

01:42:45.993 --> 01:42:49.029
COUNTY. DESPITE CENTER VERY

01:42:49.096 --> 01:42:50.898
IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL BUT I DO

01:42:50.964 --> 01:42:53.233
WANT TO MAKE A POINT THAT IT'S

01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:55.135
NOT THAT EVERY PROVIDE ON EVERY

01:42:55.202 --> 01:42:58.171

01:43:00.707 --> 01:43:02.576
OTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT AS FAR AS

02:04:01.467 --> 02:04:06.338
THAT THAT'S IT'S NOT AS MUCH.

02:04:06.405 --> 02:04:10.609
OKAY SO I'M START. AND I THINK

02:04:10.676 --> 02:04:11.377
ALL THE THINGS THAT LIKELY YOU

02:04:11.443 --> 02:04:11.977
HAVE HEARD. IT'S ABOUT- BEING

02:04:12.044 --> 02:04:12.978
ABLE TO CONTRACT. THE RATES OF

02:04:13.045 --> 02:04:15.014
CONTRACTING GETTING PAID- HOW

02:04:15.080 --> 02:04:16.148
DIFFICULT ALL THOSE THINGS ARE.

02:04:16.215 --> 02:04:17.983
HI SO IT'S KIND OF THE CORE

02:04:18.050 --> 02:04:21.520

PROVIDE. NO MORE SPECIFICALLY

02:04:26.992 --> 02:04:27.459
IF YOU START TALKING ABOUT

02:04:27.526 --> 02:04:28.360
PUBLIC HEALTH AND BEHAVIOR

02:04:28.427 --> 02:04:30.563
HEALTH. WE GET INTO LOTS OF

02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:31.931
AREAS SPECIFIC AREAS- YOU KNOW

02:04:31.997 --> 02:04:33.299
THEIR INTERACT WITH SIDE

02:04:33.365 --> 02:04:34.567
CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES

02:04:34.633 --> 02:04:36.268
THEIR INTERACTION WITH ADULTS

02:04:36.335 --> 02:04:38.504
HI. DAY CARE CENTERS- THEIR

02:04:38.571 --> 02:04:39.505

HEALTH. AND AGAIN COMING BACK

02:04:42.942 --> 02:04:46.679
TO- TO PROVIDE A FOR PROVIDER

02:04:46.745 --> 02:04:48.047
PANELS. BUT IT IT'S THOSE

02:04:48.113 --> 02:04:50.382
CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE LED TO

02:04:50.449 --> 02:04:55.254
THE- VERSION I DESCRIBED AND

02:04:55.321 --> 02:04:55.855
NOT JUST OP COUNTY IN MULTIPLE

02:04:55.921 --> 02:05:03.062
CAT. YEAH JUST. GIVE MULLIN

02:05:03.128 --> 02:05:03.662

YOUR CONCERNS. HELLO AND WE

02:05:04.597 --> 02:05:05.364
WENT THROUGH WITH THE DH CS

02:05:05.431 --> 02:05:06.966
STAFF THE BOILER PLATE

02:05:07.032 --> 02:05:07.666
CONTRACTORS AS A WE HAVE A

02:05:07.733 --> 02:05:08.601
PROPERLY DON'T THE ACTUAL

02:05:08.667 --> 02:05:10.069
CONTRACTS AND SO WE WENT

02:05:10.135 --> 02:05:11.837
THROUGH WE THESE AREN'T SO BAD

02:05:11.904 --> 02:05:14.206
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF LIVING UP

02:05:14.273 --> 02:05:16.942
TO THEM. THAT'S DIFFICULT SO I

02:05:17.009 --> 02:05:18.277
THINK THAT THE COPS THEMSELVES

02:05:18.344 --> 02:05:19.912
WHAT WE WANT FROM THE STATE I

02:05:19.979 --> 02:05:22.114
THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT'S IN

02:05:22.181 --> 02:05:22.681
THERE IT'S JUST BEEN HARD TO

02:05:22.748 --> 02:05:29.622
ACTUALLY. LIVE UP TO THOSE. SO

02:05:29.688 --> 02:05:31.457
BASED ON YOUR TESTIMONY AND I

02:05:31.523 --> 02:05:33.959
REALIZE THAT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY

02:05:34.026 --> 02:05:34.560
HAVE THE ACTUAL CONTRACT BUT-

02:05:34.627 --> 02:05:38.697
IF IT JUST COULDACTUALLY

02:05:38.764 --> 02:05:40.399
ENFORCE THE STANDARDS IN THE

02:05:40.466 --> 02:05:42.434
CONTRACT THAT YOU THE BOILER

02:05:42.501 --> 02:05:43.936
PLATE CONTACT YOU RECEIVE THAT

02:05:44.003 --> 02:05:45.437
THINGS WOULD BE MUCH BETTER

02:05:45.504 --> 02:05:47.706
WELL I MEAN IT I THINK THE YES

02:05:47.773 --> 02:05:50.209
AND I THINK THAT ONE OF IS THIS

02:05:50.276 --> 02:05:52.211
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE- THE

02:05:52.278 --> 02:05:54.013
ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS I

02:05:54.079 --> 02:05:55.381
THINK THAT IT'S REASONABLE AND

02:05:55.447 --> 02:05:57.216
I'VE IN THE RESPONSE DH CS

02:05:57.283 --> 02:05:58.350
PROTECTION AGAINST UNREASONABLY

02:05:58.417 --> 02:05:59.652
HIGH RATES ANYTHING THAT NEEDS

02:05:59.718 --> 02:06:01.387
TO BE THERE BUT I DON'T SEE

02:06:01.453 --> 02:06:02.855
ANYTHING IN THERE THAT TALKS

02:06:02.922 --> 02:06:04.690
ABOUT STANDARDS PROTECTING.

02:06:04.757 --> 02:06:07.126
THEY THE BENEFICIARIES FROM

02:06:07.192 --> 02:06:09.662
UNREASONABLY LOW RATES I DON'T

02:06:09.728 --> 02:06:11.063
KNOW WHAT THAT IS I DON'T SEE

02:06:11.130 --> 02:06:12.898
THAT BUT I DON'T SEE THAT IN

02:06:12.965 --> 02:06:14.466
THE DISCUSSION AT ANY POINT- IN

02:06:14.533 --> 02:06:18.370
RESPONSE AND SO I THINK THAT

02:06:18.437 --> 02:06:20.372
TOO THAT'S WHY WE ARE THE ONLY

02:06:20.439 --> 02:06:22.107
WAY TO CATCH ARE THESE TIME

02:06:22.174 --> 02:06:26.345
SINCE HER MAN. SO YOU HAVE TO

02:06:26.412 --> 02:06:30.249
BE. REALLY CAUTIOUS AND CAREFUL.

02:06:30.316 --> 02:06:32.217
HOW WE ARE HOLDEN TO THOSE

02:06:32.284 --> 02:06:32.818
STANDARDS WERE NOT WHEN THOSE

02:06:32.885 --> 02:06:36.455
EXCEPTIONS ARE MADE. WELL

02:06:36.522 --> 02:06:37.256
COMMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT TO

02:06:37.323 --> 02:06:38.857
PUT OUT ABOUT THIS SURE SO

02:06:38.924 --> 02:06:40.125
WHETHER AND IF WE WEREN'T CLEAR

02:06:40.192 --> 02:06:41.894
CERTAINLY IF WE WERE SEEING

02:06:41.961 --> 02:06:43.929
UNREASONABLE LIKE YOU KNOW NOT

02:06:43.996 --> 02:06:45.230
THAT I THINK THE FOLKS AT MY

02:06:45.297 --> 02:06:46.498
TABLE WOULD BE LIKE YOU'LL BE

02:06:46.565 --> 02:06:48.467
PAID TWO DOLLARS OR SOMETHING-

02:06:48.534 --> 02:06:52.137
IT IS THAT BALANCE OF IS IT

02:06:52.204 --> 02:06:53.539
REASONABLE COMPARED TO WHAT IT

02:06:53.605 --> 02:06:57.543
EITHER CAL PACE TODAY WHETHER

02:06:57.609 --> 02:06:58.010
THAT SUFFICIENT OR NOT

02:06:58.077 --> 02:07:00.179
OBVIOUSLY A CONVERSATION. WHAT

02:07:00.245 --> 02:07:00.779
IS AND AGAIN WHEN YOU HAVE TWO

02:07:00.846 --> 02:07:01.981
PLANS WHAT IT PLAN PAYING WHY

02:07:02.047 --> 02:07:04.483
IS THAT WORKING HOW DO WE LOOK

02:07:04.550 --> 02:07:05.751
AT STANDARDS LIKE. YOU KNOW

02:07:05.818 --> 02:07:07.486
COMPONENTS OF MEDICARE OR I

02:07:07.553 --> 02:07:08.854
THINK REALLY AND I THINK THIS

02:07:08.921 --> 02:07:10.122
IS THE WORK THAT OUR PLANS HAVE

02:07:10.189 --> 02:07:11.757
BEEN DOING THAT WE ARE

02:07:11.824 --> 02:07:14.159
ENCOURAGING MOVING AWAY FROM

02:07:14.226 --> 02:07:16.395
THIS CONSTRUCT OF SORT OF

02:07:16.462 --> 02:07:19.531
PAYMENT FOR SPECIFIC SERVICES

02:07:19.598 --> 02:07:21.667
BUT HOW DO WE- SERVE. AND ALL

02:07:21.734 --> 02:07:23.035
THAT IN A WAY IT HAVE THESE

02:07:23.102 --> 02:07:25.471
SENT ARRANGEMENTS AS WELL. AS

02:07:25.537 --> 02:07:27.106
NOT JUST A SERVICE WAS PROVIDED

02:07:27.172 --> 02:07:28.741
WHICH IS IMPORTANT BUT IF IT'S

02:07:28.807 --> 02:07:31.010
NOT A SERVICE THAT'S ACTUALLY

02:07:31.076 --> 02:07:32.244
SIR THE PERSON OR ADDRESSING

02:07:32.311 --> 02:07:34.279
ALL OF YOUR NEEDS. AND THE

02:07:34.346 --> 02:07:38.417
OUTCOMES ARE GETTING BETTER HOW

02:07:38.484 --> 02:07:41.353
TO COME THOSE IS TO USE IT TO

02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:45.424
MAKE SURE. MEMBERS PROVIDE.

02:07:45.491 --> 02:07:46.458
COMPANY ALL OF AND THAT'S

02:07:46.525 --> 02:07:47.059
REALLY. WORK HAVE BEEN DOING

02:07:47.126 --> 02:07:48.093
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE THE ELEMENTS

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:48.727
THAT WE'VE BEEN PUTTING IN WITH

02:07:48.794 --> 02:07:50.195
RESPECT TO PROP FIFTY SIX. AND

02:07:50.262 --> 02:07:50.796
THEN AGAIN REALLY I WAITED TO

02:07:50.863 --> 02:07:51.430
HEARKEN BACK TO. A LOT OF THE

02:07:51.497 --> 02:07:52.898
ISSUES AND SUGGESTIONS YOU SEEN

02:07:52.965 --> 02:07:54.366
OUR CALLIN PROPOSAL AS WAYS

02:07:54.433 --> 02:07:57.403
EVEN FURTHER DRIVE. AND REALLY

02:07:57.469 --> 02:07:58.670
REALLY HAVE THAT REAL

02:07:58.737 --> 02:08:00.339
OPPORTUNITY A AND SUBJECT

02:08:00.406 --> 02:08:02.341
BUDGETARY CONVERSATIONS WE'RE

02:08:02.408 --> 02:08:03.609
GOING TO HAVE. BUT WHERE

02:08:03.675 --> 02:08:05.010
COULDN'T. OR IS THE BEST WAY

02:08:05.077 --> 02:08:07.279
FOR US TO INVEST MONEY. THAT

02:08:07.346 --> 02:08:09.014
REALLY DRIVES THOSE CHANGES IN

02:08:09.081 --> 02:08:11.483
OUTCOMES IMPROVEMENTS IN NOT

02:08:11.550 --> 02:08:12.384
JUST THE QUALITY OF THEIR

02:08:12.451 --> 02:08:14.053
PARTICULAR HEALTH SERVICES BUT

02:08:14.119 --> 02:08:16.121
THEIR OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE

02:08:16.188 --> 02:08:17.156
AND THAT. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

02:08:17.222 --> 02:08:19.158
TRYING TO FOCUS AYE AND I THINK

02:08:19.224 --> 02:08:21.393
OUR PLAN THERE'S ARE ARE VERY

02:08:21.460 --> 02:08:23.796
SORT OF ON BOARD WITH THAT

02:08:23.862 --> 02:08:24.630
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. WE WILL

02:08:24.696 --> 02:08:25.931
CONTINUE TO DO THAT SO IT IT IS

02:08:25.998 --> 02:08:27.266
ALSO. SOME LOOKED TOTALLY

02:08:27.332 --> 02:08:31.003
UNREASONABLY SO THAT WE WOULD

02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:32.805
REJECT AN ALTERNATIVE ACCESS

02:08:32.871 --> 02:08:36.842
REQUIRE. LESS BUT WE ALSO DO

02:08:36.909 --> 02:08:41.880
YOU HAVE. TO YOU KNOW AS FISCAL

02:08:41.947 --> 02:08:48.720
AGENTS OF STATE. WHAT I MEAN SO

02:08:48.787 --> 02:08:49.755
IT'S NOT A BALANCE OF BOTH

02:08:49.822 --> 02:08:51.924
MAKING SURE IT'S NOT. TOO LOW

02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:54.860
BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING WHAT IS

02:08:54.927 --> 02:08:57.162
REASONABLE FROM A MORE TALKING

02:08:57.229 --> 02:08:57.729
ABOUT I THINK IN THE COMP I

02:08:57.796 --> 02:08:58.664
THINK THAT COMES BACK TO A

02:08:58.730 --> 02:08:59.898
PREVIOUS KIND PATIENT ABOUT

02:08:59.965 --> 02:09:01.467
WHAT ARE THE STANDARDS YEAH AND

02:09:01.533 --> 02:09:03.836
THE AND THAT'S FAIR AND THEN.

02:09:03.902 --> 02:09:04.436
WHAT WE SHOULD DEFINITELY HAVE

02:09:04.503 --> 02:09:06.071
THAT CONVERSATION. AND THEN THE

02:09:06.138 --> 02:09:07.873
OTHER QUESTION I HAVE. THE

02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:10.175
REFERENCE IS MADE TO TABLE

02:09:10.242 --> 02:09:11.110
THREE AND THE HE THIS

02:09:11.176 --> 02:09:16.148
PERFORMANCE. AND I WON'T. I'M

02:09:16.215 --> 02:09:17.716
NOT GONNA GO BETWEEN THE

02:09:17.783 --> 02:09:21.220
DIFFERENT PLANS BUT HOW. SO YOU

02:09:21.286 --> 02:09:22.321
KNOW WE HAVE HERE NUMBER

02:09:22.387 --> 02:09:24.890
MEASURES TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY

02:09:24.957 --> 02:09:25.991
TO THE TERROR OF THE HOUSE AND

02:09:26.058 --> 02:09:26.925
THEN WE HAVE THE NUMBER OF

02:09:26.992 --> 02:09:28.193
AVERAGE NUMBER IF YOU JUST

02:09:28.260 --> 02:09:29.561
MEASURES BELOW MINIMUM

02:09:29.628 --> 02:09:30.729
PERFORMANCE LEVEL SO THESE ARE

02:09:30.796 --> 02:09:31.964
ALL BELOW MINIMUM PERFORMANCE

02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:35.334
LEVELS. AND SO GOOD THING IS

02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:37.402
THAT TWENTY EIGHTEENS LOOKS

02:09:37.469 --> 02:09:40.439
BETTER IN THE PRIOR YEARS. HOW

02:09:40.506 --> 02:09:41.073
THIS COMMERCIALLY COMPARED TO A

02:09:41.140 --> 02:09:44.743
TYPICAL COMMERCIAL PLAN. SO IS

02:09:44.810 --> 02:09:47.012
THIS IS IT THE NUMBER OF THE

02:09:47.079 --> 02:09:49.114
LOW PERFORMANCE LEVELS THIS

02:09:49.181 --> 02:09:50.182
TYPICAL FOR THAT COMMERCIAL

02:09:50.249 --> 02:09:51.216
PLAN WILL NORMALLY HAVE THIS

02:09:51.283 --> 02:09:53.585
MANY BLOW PERFORMANCE LEVELS IS

02:09:53.652 --> 02:09:56.388
WE'RE SEEING I'M NOT GONNA PICK

02:09:56.455 --> 02:09:57.022
ON ANY PARTICULAR PLAN HERE BUT

02:09:57.089 --> 02:09:59.358
WE CAN SEE THEIR- HOUSES. YEAH

02:09:59.424 --> 02:10:00.959
WITH THAT I THINK I MEAN I USED

02:10:01.026 --> 02:10:01.793
TO COME FROM THE COMMERCIAL

02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:04.429
SIDE A FEW YEARS SO I

02:10:04.496 --> 02:10:04.997
DEFINITELY THINK THE PATIENT

02:10:05.063 --> 02:10:06.265
POPULATION IS VERY DIFFERENT.

02:10:06.331 --> 02:10:07.199
THAT'S NOT MY QUESTION I

02:10:07.266 --> 02:10:09.301
UNDERSTAND THAT THAT IS SO IS

02:10:09.368 --> 02:10:10.836
THIS IS THIS ACCEPTABLE WARS

02:10:10.903 --> 02:10:12.237
THE SERVICE NATIONALLY AND

02:10:12.304 --> 02:10:14.173
PROVIDED THIS AND SAID WE WERE

02:10:14.239 --> 02:10:16.642
BELOW OF THIS MANY LEVELS WITH

02:10:16.708 --> 02:10:19.411
THAT THE- IS THAT TYPICAL. IT'S

02:10:19.478 --> 02:10:21.480
NOT ACCEPTABLE I CAN TELL YOU

02:10:21.547 --> 02:10:22.748
COMMITTED TO. THE SCORES OF THE

02:10:22.814 --> 02:10:24.316
S. S. AS A LOT TO A PARTNER

02:10:24.383 --> 02:10:25.050
YES. ON ON IMPROVE WE'VE WE'VE

02:10:25.117 --> 02:10:28.887
ACTUALLY. FOR MOST IMPROVED

02:10:28.954 --> 02:10:29.521
AWARD IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS IT

02:10:29.588 --> 02:10:32.224
IS A LOT OF MEASURES IT'S AT A

02:10:32.291 --> 02:10:35.194
LOT OF- EXCHANGE OF DATA. AS

02:10:35.260 --> 02:10:37.863
WELL AS ACCESO HE THIS IS VERY

02:10:37.930 --> 02:10:38.497
COMPLEX AND I WE HAVE A I DON'T

02:10:38.564 --> 02:10:41.934
BELIEVE ME I. DEFINITELY NOT

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:42.801
WHAT WE WANT TO BE I THINK

02:10:42.868 --> 02:10:43.969
1100% THAT THE TOP TIER AND WE

02:10:44.036 --> 02:10:45.304
ARE. COMMITTED TO THAT WHETHER

02:10:45.370 --> 02:10:45.837
IT'S FOR THE PHYSICIAN AND

02:10:45.904 --> 02:10:47.105
SENATE'S WHETHER IT'S DATA

02:10:47.172 --> 02:10:49.174
SUPPORT WHETHER IT'S- NURSES IN

02:10:49.241 --> 02:10:50.809
THE OFFICES OF PROVIDERS WHICH

02:10:50.876 --> 02:10:51.743
HAVE. WHETHER IT'S GOING TO

02:10:51.810 --> 02:10:52.578
MEMBERS HOMES THERE'S A

02:10:52.644 --> 02:10:53.512
DIFFERENT WAYS TO IMPROVE YOUR

OR WHAT CAN WE DO. WELL I THINK

02:20:22.413 --> 02:20:22.981
THAT'S SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT

02:20:23.047 --> 02:20:23.581
HEALTH CARE SERVICES NEEDS TO

DO AND THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE

02:20:24.582 --> 02:20:25.016
HAVE RECOMMENDED TO THE

02:20:25.083 --> 02:20:27.051
DEPARTMENT SO IT SHOULDN'T BE A

02:20:27.118 --> 02:20:27.619
ONE AND DONE IT SHOULD BE

02:20:27.685 --> 02:20:29.187
PERIODICALLY THEY NEED TO BE

02:20:29.254 --> 02:20:32.323
LOOKING AT- ACCESS TO CARE WHEN

02:20:32.390 --> 02:20:32.924
THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE

02:20:32.991 --> 02:20:34.926
CONSIDERING THE ALTERNATIVE

02:20:34.993 --> 02:20:37.095
ACCESS STANDARDS IN DETERMINING

02:20:37.162 --> 02:20:39.130
WHETHER THEY'RE GONNA PROVE ANY

ADDITIONAL STAND ADICIONAL

02:20:40.398 --> 02:20:43.368
ALTERED TAXES UNDER. THEY NEED

02:20:43.434 --> 02:20:46.037

AND THE THINGS WE HAD IN THE

02:20:46.671 --> 02:20:49.541
REPORT IS. I MEAN A PLAN WOULD

02:20:49.607 --> 02:20:51.009
SUGGEST WE DON'T HAVE ANY

02:20:51.075 --> 02:20:53.244
PROVIDERS IN THE REGION SO WE

02:20:53.311 --> 02:20:55.113
NEED AN ALTERNATE ACCESS

02:20:55.180 --> 02:20:56.414

02:28:44.415 --> 02:28:46.384
CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO FOCUS ON-

02:28:46.450 --> 02:28:48.819
WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS TO CARE

02:28:48.886 --> 02:28:50.254
AGAIN I'M NOT GONNA GO INTO ALL

02:28:50.321 --> 02:28:50.855
THE DETAILS WE HAD THE SAME

02:28:50.921 --> 02:28:53.491
ISSUES IN THIS REPORT. THIS WAS

02:28:53.557 --> 02:28:54.792

CONCERNS ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE

02:28:59.363 --> 02:29:00.898

RESPECT TO APPROVING

02:29:02.633 --> 02:29:05.770
ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS-

02:29:05.836 --> 02:29:11.609
OR REQUESTS AND- OF THE TEN

02:29:11.676 --> 02:29:12.143
THOUSAND THAT I MENTIONED

02:29:12.209 --> 02:29:16.647
EARLIER ABOUT SIXTY EIGHT

02:29:16.714 --> 02:29:17.181
HUNDRED OF THOSE WERE FOR.

02:29:17.248 --> 02:29:21.085
FIGHTER PROVIDE. IS TO. A LOT

02:29:21.152 --> 02:29:22.186
STANDARD WERE RE APPROVED ARE

02:29:22.253 --> 02:29:24.522
FOR PROVIDERS IN THE- MANY OF

02:29:24.588 --> 02:29:25.389
THESE PLANS WE ACTUALLY DUG A

02:29:25.456 --> 02:29:26.390
LITTLE DEEPER AND DETERMINE

02:29:26.457 --> 02:29:28.125
WHAT WAS THE UTILIZATION RATE

02:29:28.192 --> 02:29:29.293
FOR THESE PLANS AND THE

02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:30.328
UTILIZATION RATE FOR CHILDREN

02:29:30.394 --> 02:29:31.729
FOR THESE PLANS THAT WERE

02:29:31.796 --> 02:29:32.263
ASKING FOR THESE ALTERNATE

02:29:32.330 --> 02:29:33.931
ACCESS STANDARDS. WAS AGAIN

02:29:33.998 --> 02:29:36.901
BELOW 50% SO THOSE ALL

02:29:36.967 --> 02:29:39.804
IDENTIFIED ISSUES FOR US WITH

02:29:39.870 --> 02:29:42.707
RESPECT TO ACCESS TO CARE AND

02:29:42.773 --> 02:29:44.041
CERTAINLY WE HAVE

02:29:44.108 --> 02:29:45.776
RECOMMENDATIONS WITH RESPECT TO

02:29:45.843 --> 02:29:48.212
OUR DEPARTMENT CARE SERVICES IN

02:29:48.279 --> 02:29:49.814

RESPECT TO OUR APPROVING.

02:29:51.882 --> 02:29:55.019
ALTERNATE ACT THE STANDARDS.

02:29:55.086 --> 02:29:56.187
THE OTHER TWO THAT WE LOOKED AT

02:29:56.253 --> 02:29:56.787
WITH RESPECT TO THE DEPARTMENT

02:29:56.854 --> 02:29:57.321
OF CARE SERVICES AND ITS

02:29:57.388 --> 02:29:59.757
RESPONSIBILITIES- IS IT'S

02:29:59.824 --> 02:30:02.893
OVERSIGHT AND- THE FACT THAT

02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:04.161
THE CONCLUSION WE RATE IS WE

02:30:04.228 --> 02:30:05.496
FELT THAT THE DHS WAS.

02:30:05.563 --> 02:30:07.231
DELEGATING A LOT OF ITS

02:30:07.298 --> 02:30:08.966
RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE PLANS

02:30:09.033 --> 02:30:11.102
AND THE REASON WE SAY THAT IS

02:30:11.168 --> 02:30:13.104
THERE ARE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

02:30:13.170 --> 02:30:14.672
IN FEDERAL LAW THAT CHILDREN

02:30:14.739 --> 02:30:18.943

THAT SHOULD BE PROVIDED

02:30:33.357 --> 02:30:35.926
CHILDREN- SO WE WERE EXPECTING

02:30:35.993 --> 02:30:38.195
THAT HEALTHCARE SERVICES WOULD

02:30:38.262 --> 02:30:40.731
HAVE VERY SPECIFIC EXPECTATIONS

02:30:40.798 --> 02:30:43.401

THEIR SCHEDULE- AND

02:30:45.436 --> 02:30:47.872
UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE LOOKED AT

CONTRACTS BETWEEN HEALTH CARE

02:30:50.541 --> 02:30:52.243
SERVICES AND THE PLANS THOSE

02:30:52.309 --> 02:30:55.379
CONTRACTS WERE NOT CLEAR AS TO

02:30:55.446 --> 02:30:57.848
WHAT. THE ACT RECALL WERE AS

02:30:57.915 --> 02:31:00.684
FAR AS WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS.

02:31:00.751 --> 02:31:02.520
OF PROVIDERS IN BEING ABLE TO

02:31:02.586 --> 02:31:03.120
PROVIDE SERVICES TO CHILDREN

02:31:03.187 --> 02:31:03.788
THAT ARE ON THIS BRIGHT FUTURES

02:31:03.854 --> 02:31:05.055
ALL THESE PREVENTIVE SERVICES

02:31:05.122 --> 02:31:06.490
THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO

02:31:06.557 --> 02:31:08.259
CHILDREN WE WEREN'T SEEING WE

02:31:08.325 --> 02:31:09.460
DIDN'T THINK THOSE CONTRACTS

02:31:09.527 --> 02:31:11.562
WERE STRONG ENOUGH WE DIDN'T

02:31:11.629 --> 02:31:12.630
THINK THAT DEPARTMENT OF CARE

02:31:12.696 --> 02:31:14.865
SERVICES WAS REALLY CLEARLY

02:31:14.932 --> 02:31:18.602
COMMUNICATE TO THE ENDS AND

02:31:18.669 --> 02:31:20.771
THEREFORE THE PLANS WERE NOT

02:31:20.838 --> 02:31:22.440
INDICATING TO PROVIDE WHAT THE

02:31:22.506 --> 02:31:25.676

02:31:25.743 --> 02:31:28.045
PROVIDE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN.

02:31:28.112 --> 02:31:29.847
OTHER SIMILAR TO THAT WHERE

02:31:29.914 --> 02:31:31.315
YOU'RE LOOK AT MORE. AND SO

02:31:31.382 --> 02:31:31.916
TYPICALLY THE ADAGES IF YOU

02:31:33.584 --> 02:31:34.652
MEASURE AGAINST SOMETHING

02:31:34.718 --> 02:31:36.554
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO PERFORM AND

02:31:36.620 --> 02:31:38.055
SO WE LOOKED AT PERFORMANCE

02:31:38.122 --> 02:31:41.759
TRICKS- FOR THE BRIGHT FUTURE

02:31:41.826 --> 02:31:42.626
SCHEDULE SO THERE ARE A VARIETY

02:31:42.693 --> 02:31:44.195
OF DIFFERENT TIME FRAMES AND

02:31:44.261 --> 02:31:45.296
THE TIME FRAME THAT HEALTH CARE

02:31:45.362 --> 02:31:47.998
SERVICES WAS HOLDING. UP PLANS

02:31:48.065 --> 02:31:50.968
ACCOUNTABLE TO WE SAW HIGH

02:31:51.035 --> 02:31:53.404

02:31:53.471 --> 02:31:56.240
AGES THREE TO SIX TIPPER

02:31:56.307 --> 02:31:59.076
UTILIZATION RATES FOR CHILDREN

02:31:59.143 --> 02:32:02.313

SIXTY AND SEVENTY CENTS. AS A

02:32:04.014 --> 02:32:04.982

CASE THEIR WORK. SIGNIFICANTLY

02:32:12.423 --> 02:32:14.191
BELOW THE 50% OR THE AVERAGE

02:32:14.258 --> 02:32:14.825
FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO.

02:32:14.892 --> 02:32:15.960
WE FELT THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:32:16.026 --> 02:32:17.495
CARE SERVICES NEEDS TO MAKE

02:32:17.561 --> 02:32:18.662

02:33:00.905 --> 02:33:03.207
BETTER. SPECIFICALLY ALSO

02:33:03.274 --> 02:33:04.375
LOOKING AT DOCTOR BUT WHEN HE

TO MAKE SURE THAT.

02:33:19.023 --> 02:33:21.091
BENEFICIARIES HAVE INFORMATION

REQUIRING. THIS TO ME SURE AT

02:33:51.488 --> 02:33:52.990
UNDERSTAND WHO THE FISHERIES

02:33:53.057 --> 02:33:56.293
ARE THERE ARE CULTURAL BARRIERS

02:33:56.360 --> 02:33:57.928

DEAL WITH WE NEED TO ADDRESS

02:34:01.765 --> 02:34:02.633
THOSE AND WE DIDN'T THINK

02:34:02.700 --> 02:34:03.734
HEALTH CARE SERVICES WAS DOING

02:34:03.801 --> 02:34:07.071
AT A JOB THAT COULD SHOW UP. TO

02:34:07.137 --> 02:34:07.538
MAKE SURE. AND FOR THE

02:34:07.605 --> 02:34:17.114
PROVIDERS. FULL WHAT WE DIDN'T

02:34:17.181 --> 02:34:19.917
SEE IS- HEALTH CARE SERVICES

02:34:19.984 --> 02:34:21.619
MAKING SURE THAT THEY WERE

02:34:21.685 --> 02:34:23.387
SHARING ALL OF THE INFORMATION

02:34:23.454 --> 02:34:26.991
NOT JUST WITH RESPECT TO THE TO

02:34:27.057 --> 02:34:27.591
THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS BECAUSE

02:34:27.658 --> 02:34:28.759
THOSE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

02:34:28.826 --> 02:34:31.362
OTHER ISSUES WHERE PLANS HAVE

02:34:31.428 --> 02:34:33.097
ADDRESSED SOME CONCERNS THAT

02:34:33.163 --> 02:34:33.998
HAVE BEEN RAISED BY HEALTH CARE

02:34:34.064 --> 02:34:36.066
SERVICES WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE

02:34:36.133 --> 02:34:37.468
SHARING ESSENTIALLY BEST

02:34:37.534 --> 02:34:39.470
PRACTICES OR STRATEGIES THAT

02:34:39.536 --> 02:34:41.639
ARE THAT. VARIOUS PLANS WERE

02:34:41.705 --> 02:34:43.540
USING TO TRY TO GET REALIZATION

02:34:43.607 --> 02:34:45.342
RATES UP. WE SAW THAT THEY HAD

02:34:45.409 --> 02:34:47.578
SOME PERIODIC CALLS QUARTERLY

02:34:47.645 --> 02:34:49.813
CALLS QUARTERLY PROGRESS

02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:51.415
REPORTS BUT AGAIN WE THINK

02:34:51.482 --> 02:34:52.449
THOSE COULD BE MORE

02:34:52.516 --> 02:34:52.950
COMPREHENSIVE AND MORE

02:34:53.017 --> 02:34:56.220
BENEFICIAL TO. THE VARIOUS

02:34:56.286 --> 02:34:59.556
PLANS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY

02:34:59.623 --> 02:35:00.491
WERE AWARE OF ANY STRATEGIES

02:35:00.557 --> 02:35:02.960
THEY COULD USE TRY TO INCREASE.

02:35:03.027 --> 02:35:04.828
THE AND EDUCATE THE FISHER

02:35:04.895 --> 02:35:06.997

SERVICES FOR THEIR CHILDREN.

02:35:08.966 --> 02:35:09.433

THIRTEEN. WE ISSUED THIS REPORT

02:37:00.611 --> 02:37:02.479
FIRST IS ACCESS THE SECOND IS

02:37:02.546 --> 02:37:04.948
OVERSIGHT- THE THIRTY SHARE.

02:37:05.015 --> 02:37:06.583
AND THE FOURTH- IT HAS TO DO

02:37:06.650 --> 02:37:07.651
WITH UTILIZING THOSE AYE

HAVE. THE FIRST RECORD ASIAN IN

02:37:14.491 --> 02:37:16.493
THE ACCESS CATEGORY. WAS THE DH

02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:18.996
CS SHOULD IDENTIFY AREAS WHERE

02:37:19.062 --> 02:37:21.231
MORE PROVIDERS WERE NEEDED- AND

02:37:21.298 --> 02:37:23.167
THEN TO RECRUIT MORE PROVIDERS

02:37:23.233 --> 02:37:26.970
IN THOSE AREAS- USING-

02:37:27.037 --> 02:37:29.072
REQUESTING FUNDING IN INCREASES

02:37:29.139 --> 02:37:32.676
AS NECESSARY. THIS IS THE

PROGRAM HOWEVER WE. WE FOUND

02:37:42.019 --> 02:37:44.855
THAT DH CS COULD. SHOULD NOT

02:37:44.922 --> 02:37:47.024
LIMIT WHAT IT DOES TO JUST THAT

02:37:47.090 --> 02:37:51.361
ONE SINGLE PROGRAM. THE SECOND

02:37:51.428 --> 02:37:52.663

WITH- CLARIFYING ITS CONTRACTS

02:37:55.365 --> 02:37:58.001
THAT THERE THE PLANS ARE

IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED ANY OF

02:38:24.828 --> 02:38:27.331
THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THE FIRST

02:38:27.397 --> 02:38:28.298
WAS TO UTILIZE THE PERFORMANCE

WAS TO IMPLEMENT AUDIT

02:38:37.875 --> 02:38:41.511
PROCEDURES- THAT ARE SPECIFIC

02:38:41.578 --> 02:38:42.079

PREVENTIVE SERVICES. THE FOURTH

02:38:54.625 --> 02:38:57.394
WAS THAT IT SHOULD- ENSURE

02:38:57.461 --> 02:38:57.895
BETTER ACCURACY AND PLAN

02:38:57.961 --> 02:39:00.797
PROVIDER DIRECTORIES. THE FIFTH

02:39:00.864 --> 02:39:01.331
IS THAT IT SHOULD USE ITS

02:39:01.398 --> 02:39:05.002
HEALTH DISPARITY STUDY- TO

02:39:05.068 --> 02:39:07.070
DRIVE TARGETED INTERVENTIONS-

02:39:07.137 --> 02:39:08.772
WHEN THERE ARE- HEALTH

02:39:08.839 --> 02:39:11.541
DISPARITIES BETWEEN CHILDREN OF

02:39:11.608 --> 02:39:12.175
DIFFERENT ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS IN

02:39:12.242 --> 02:39:16.046
LANGUAGE NEEDS. AND THE SIX IN

02:39:16.113 --> 02:39:16.847
THE OVERSIGHT CATEGORY WAS THAT

02:39:16.914 --> 02:39:18.949
DH CS SHOULD USES. SHOULD

02:39:19.016 --> 02:39:20.851
REQUIRE PLANS TO USE THE GROUP

02:39:20.918 --> 02:39:21.518
IN THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT

02:39:21.585 --> 02:39:28.759
REPORTS- TO ALSO FOLLOW UP. TO

02:39:28.825 --> 02:39:29.393
ADDRESS FINDINGS THAT STEM FROM

02:39:29.459 --> 02:39:33.263
THOSE REPORTS. IN THE SHARING

02:39:33.330 --> 02:39:34.564
CATEGORY THERE WERE TWO

02:39:34.631 --> 02:39:35.933
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE TO

02:39:35.999 --> 02:39:38.101
DH CS THE FIRST IS THAT IT

02:39:38.168 --> 02:39:39.970
SHOULD IDENTIFY EFFECTIVE

02:39:40.037 --> 02:39:41.905
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IN IN THE

02:39:41.972 --> 02:39:43.807
VARIOUS PLANS AND THEN SHARED

02:39:43.874 --> 02:39:46.877
THOSE- HOSE EFFECTIVE

02:39:46.944 --> 02:39:47.477
INCENTIVE PROGRAM. ALL OF THE

02:39:47.544 --> 02:39:49.980
PLANTS. DHS IS SAID THAT IT.

02:39:50.047 --> 02:39:54.418
THAT RECOMMENDATION- BUT IT IS

02:39:54.484 --> 02:39:57.154
NOT YET. GOTTEN AROUND TO IT

02:39:57.220 --> 02:39:59.156
THE SECT SHARING RECOMMENDATION

02:39:59.222 --> 02:40:00.691
HAD TO DO ASSURING THE RESULTS

02:40:00.757 --> 02:40:02.426
OF SEX- SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIES

02:40:02.492 --> 02:40:03.794
FROM ITS CORRECTIVE ACTION

02:40:03.860 --> 02:40:06.129
PROGRESS- PROCESS THE PLAN TO

02:40:06.196 --> 02:40:10.968
STUDY ACT PROCESS- DCS HAS

02:40:11.034 --> 02:40:13.203
BEGUN COLLECTING CAM SUCCESSFUL

02:40:13.270 --> 02:40:16.640
STRATEGIES BUT IT HAS NOT YET

02:40:16.707 --> 02:40:18.041
SHARED THOSE. THE PLANTS. AND

02:40:18.108 --> 02:40:18.642
IN THE LAST CATEGORY HAD TO DO

02:40:18.709 --> 02:40:19.376
WITH BETTER UTILITY. A REVIEW

02:40:19.443 --> 02:40:24.648
OR TOOLS- WE HAD

02:40:24.715 --> 02:40:27.317
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT DH CS-

02:40:27.384 --> 02:40:30.921
SHOULD USE MORE RECENT DATA AND

02:40:30.988 --> 02:40:33.790
MORE OFTEN- TO VALIDATE THE

02:40:33.857 --> 02:40:36.994
DATA THAT IT HAS- WE HAD A

02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:38.362
RECOMMENDATION- THAT IT SHOULD

02:40:38.428 --> 02:40:42.132
USE THAT HE GROWS- THEY SHOULD

02:40:42.199 --> 02:40:45.402
IMPLEMENT THE EQUALS REP

02:40:45.469 --> 02:40:45.936
RECOMMENDATIONS RELATE TO

02:40:46.003 --> 02:40:47.471
CHILDREN PREVENTIVE SERVICES.

02:40:47.537 --> 02:40:49.139
AT A RECOMMENDATION DCS. IN

02:40:49.206 --> 02:40:50.574
ASSESSMENT OF THE PLANT THE

02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:52.909
ACTIONS THAT PLANTS HAVE TAKEN

02:40:52.976 --> 02:40:53.710
TO ADDRESS THE EGRESS

02:40:53.777 --> 02:40:56.947
RECOMMENDATIONS I IN ALL THREE

02:40:57.014 --> 02:40:57.481
OF THOSE HAVE NOT YET BEEN

02:40:57.547 --> 02:41:01.151
FULLY IMPLEMENTED. OKAY THANK

02:41:01.218 --> 02:41:09.226
YOU. QUESTIONS JUST TO. ONE

02:41:09.292 --> 02:41:12.329
QUESTION- SO IS YOU MAY NOTE IN

02:41:12.396 --> 02:41:15.832
THE REPORT THEAGE RANGES ON

02:41:15.899 --> 02:41:19.803
WHICH THE DTS ACTUALLY MONITORS

02:41:19.870 --> 02:41:22.406
PERFORMS MUCH BETTER THAN THE

02:41:22.472 --> 02:41:26.376
OTHER AGE RANGES. THAT'S

02:41:26.443 --> 02:41:29.579
CORRECT SO THAT TO ME IMPLIES

02:41:29.646 --> 02:41:32.115
THAT IF PEOPLE REALLY WANTED TO

02:41:32.182 --> 02:41:32.716
THEY COULD AT LEAST PERFORM AS

02:41:32.783 --> 02:41:35.585
WELL AS THAT. WE SHOULD STILL

02:41:35.652 --> 02:41:36.720
PERFORM BETTER BUT THEY COULD

02:41:36.787 --> 02:41:38.655
AT LEAST PERFORM AS WELL AS

02:41:38.722 --> 02:41:40.323
THOSE AGE RANGES WHERE SHE

02:41:40.390 --> 02:41:42.659
BASICALLY- UP AROUND BETWEEN

02:41:42.726 --> 02:41:46.863
6275% VERSES ARE. TURN AVERAGE

02:41:46.930 --> 02:41:48.799
OF BELOW 50% I GUESS FORTY NINE

02:41:48.865 --> 02:41:52.502
PERCENT. DID YOU- IDENTIFY IN

02:41:52.569 --> 02:41:54.671
THE AUDITS- THINGS THAT WERE

02:41:54.738 --> 02:41:56.573
DONE DIFFERENTLY FOR THOSE AGE

02:41:56.640 --> 02:41:57.474
RANGES ASIDE FROM THE

02:41:57.541 --> 02:41:59.709
MONITORING- WATER PENALTIES

02:41:59.776 --> 02:42:01.645
ASSOCIATED WITH NOT HITTING

02:42:01.711 --> 02:42:03.113
PERFORMANCE TARGETS ARE IT IT

02:42:03.180 --> 02:42:05.148
DIFFERENCES FOR THAT IS AGE

02:42:05.215 --> 02:42:09.753
RANGES BAND FOR THE OTHER- AGES

02:42:09.820 --> 02:42:13.924
AND WHICH DIVERSE. BE ASIDE

02:42:13.990 --> 02:42:14.357
FROM THE OTHER TRADE

02:42:14.424 --> 02:42:16.493
CONSEQUENCES RELATED TO THAT.

02:42:16.560 --> 02:42:17.894
YES DR AS YOU MENTIONED-

02:42:17.961 --> 02:42:18.895
BECAUSE IT WAS A PERFORMANCE

02:42:18.962 --> 02:42:19.496
BECAUSE IT WAS SOMETHING THAT

02:42:19.563 --> 02:42:21.298
THEY WERE HOLDING THE PLANS

02:42:21.364 --> 02:42:22.599
ACCOUNTABLE FOR WE FOUND THAT.

02:42:22.666 --> 02:42:23.700
THE REALIZATION RATES WERE MUCH

02:42:23.767 --> 02:42:25.569
HIGHER IN THOSE AREAS- THEY

02:42:25.635 --> 02:42:26.570
WERE NOT HOLDING PLANS

02:42:26.636 --> 02:42:28.672
ACCOUNTABLE FOR PERFORMANCE FOR

02:42:28.738 --> 02:42:31.074
DELIVERING PREVENTIVE SERVICES

02:42:31.141 --> 02:42:34.311
FOR THE- THE H. ONE AND TWO

02:42:34.377 --> 02:42:35.745
YEAR OLDS AND FOR THE CHILDREN

02:42:35.812 --> 02:42:38.248
WHO ARE OVER SIX RESULT. SO

02:42:38.315 --> 02:42:39.850
THERE WAS A DIFFERENT. HAVE

02:42:39.916 --> 02:42:41.151
SOMEONE DIDN'T HITTER

02:42:41.218 --> 02:42:42.085
PERFORMANCE MEASURE ON AGES

02:42:42.152 --> 02:42:44.154
THEY WERE MONITORING DID.

02:42:44.221 --> 02:42:44.988
THAT'S THAT'S DO YOU HAVE AN

02:42:45.055 --> 02:42:45.956
ANSWER FOR THAT I CAN ASK EACH

02:42:46.022 --> 02:42:49.059
YES. YEP WE ACTUALLY DID REVIEW

02:42:49.126 --> 02:42:52.629
THAT WE FOUND THAT- DHS

02:42:52.696 --> 02:42:53.463
MENTIONED WHEN THEY WERE UP

02:42:53.530 --> 02:42:54.764
HERE BEFORE THEY MENTIONED THAT

02:42:54.831 --> 02:42:56.766
THEY HAVE. WAYS TO HOLD AND

02:42:56.833 --> 02:42:58.034
ACCOUNTABLE- THEY DO. HAVE A

02:42:58.101 --> 02:42:59.503
PROCESS FOR ISSUING SANCTIONS

02:42:59.569 --> 02:43:01.938
BUT WE FOUND IN OUR REPORT-

02:43:02.005 --> 02:43:03.273
THEY HADN'T DONE THAT THEY HAD

02:43:03.340 --> 02:43:06.409
ACTUALLY ISSUED SANCTIONS- UP

02:43:06.476 --> 02:43:08.078
UNTIL THE POINT WHEN WE STARTED

02:43:08.145 --> 02:43:10.714
OUR REPORT. AFTER WE STARTED

02:43:10.780 --> 02:43:11.648
OUR REPORT WE NOTED THAT THEY

02:43:11.715 --> 02:43:16.920
DID- IT THAT- METHOD OF HOLDING

02:43:16.987 --> 02:43:19.589
THE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE. OKAY Q.

02:43:19.656 --> 02:43:21.291
AND I HOPE THAT WE SHOULD REDO

02:43:21.358 --> 02:43:21.925
THE SUDDEN FIGHT IN A FEW YEARS

02:43:21.992 --> 02:43:23.593
AND SEE WHERE WE ARE. OKAY

WHAT WAS WHAT IMPACT THEIR WE

02:44:08.672 --> 02:44:11.441
KNOW IS A VERY SUBSTANTIAL-

02:44:11.508 --> 02:44:13.009
NUMBER RECOMMENDATIONS I KNOW

02:44:13.076 --> 02:44:14.411
THERE WAS A HEARING ON THIS

02:44:14.477 --> 02:44:16.246
EARLIER IN THE YEAR WITH SOME

02:44:16.313 --> 02:44:18.048
OF THESE THINGS WERE DRESSED

02:44:18.114 --> 02:44:20.283
BUT AGAIN JUST TO REPEAT WHAT.

ACTION PLAN IN RESPONSE TO IT-

02:44:28.858 --> 02:44:31.161
DSS RECOGNIZES THE STANDS

02:44:31.228 --> 02:44:32.729

MEDICAID FIFTIETH PERCENTILE. I

02:47:09.486 --> 02:47:11.087

02:47:11.154 --> 02:47:13.656
SHARED. HE'S ON THIS WITH WITH

02:47:13.723 --> 02:47:18.428
YOU DOCTOR PAN AS WELL AS

02:47:18.495 --> 02:47:18.995
OTHERS THERE THERE ARE ALSO

02:47:19.062 --> 02:47:23.366
SOME. THE ART OF HOW SORT OF

02:47:23.433 --> 02:47:24.134
NAZARIAN COME MEASURING

02:47:24.200 --> 02:47:25.001
PERFORMANCE BASED ON JUST

02:47:25.068 --> 02:47:27.404
COMPARED OF NEST TO OTHER PLANS

02:47:27.470 --> 02:47:29.272
RIGHT SO BEING AT THE FIFTIETH

02:47:29.339 --> 02:47:31.241
PERCENTILE MEANS YOU'RE SORT

02:47:31.307 --> 02:47:34.010
OF. ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF ALL

02:47:34.077 --> 02:47:35.612
PLANNED ALL NATIONAL MEDICAID

02:47:35.678 --> 02:47:37.347
PLANS IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY SPEAK

02:47:37.414 --> 02:47:39.349
TO WHETHER ANY OF THE PEOPLE AT

02:47:39.416 --> 02:47:41.217

BOTTOM REALLY DOING A GOOD JOB

02:47:47.724 --> 02:47:49.659
SORT OF PARTICULARLY WHEN SOME

02:47:49.726 --> 02:47:51.828
OF THOSE MEASURES THAT ARE SORT

02:47:51.895 --> 02:47:53.029
OF. PRETTY CLOSE. I THINK YOU

02:47:53.096 --> 02:47:57.534
KNOW THE LARGER. METHODOLOGY

02:47:57.600 --> 02:47:58.101
WITH THE STANDARD WAY THAT.

02:47:58.168 --> 02:47:58.668
HEALTH QUALITY HAS HAS BEEN

02:47:58.735 --> 02:47:59.436
MEASURED IS REALLY THAT ISSUE

02:47:59.502 --> 02:48:01.871
OF IF EVERYBODY'S DOING BAD.

02:48:01.938 --> 02:48:04.274
THE BEST OF THE BAD IS STILL

02:48:04.340 --> 02:48:07.377
NOT GOOD ENOUGH I THINK YOU SEE

02:48:07.444 --> 02:48:09.078
THAT PARTICULARLY WITH THE WITH

02:48:09.145 --> 02:48:10.780
MEASURES AROUND KIDS. AND

02:48:10.847 --> 02:48:11.748
UNFORTUNATELY IN THE SUCH. AN

02:48:11.815 --> 02:48:12.916
OUT SCREENING MEASURES- BELIEVE

02:48:12.982 --> 02:48:14.617
THE NATIONAL MEDICAID-

02:48:14.684 --> 02:48:18.054
IMMEDIATE AS LIKE 12% OR EIGHTY

02:48:18.121 --> 02:48:20.190
IT'S SOMETHING LESS THAN 20%

02:48:20.256 --> 02:48:25.261
WHICH IS NOT DOES NOT OKAY. AND

02:48:25.328 --> 02:48:26.563
SO WHAT WE'VE ALSO IMPLEMENTED

02:48:26.629 --> 02:48:29.899
THAT MATT THAT IT. HAS BEEN

02:48:29.966 --> 02:48:31.701
THEY HAVE. BEEN SO REGARDLESS

02:48:31.768 --> 02:48:32.635
OF WHERE YOU FALL NOT SOME TILE

02:48:32.702 --> 02:48:33.236
THIS IS REALLY WHERE YOU NEED

02:48:33.303 --> 02:48:34.103
TO BE SO WE- JUST INTO THE

02:48:34.170 --> 02:48:35.572
FIFTIETH PERCENTILE MEASURES

02:48:35.638 --> 02:48:38.041
ADDED FOR THOSE MEASURES BUT

02:48:38.107 --> 02:48:39.676
THAT THESE EXIST. THESE

02:48:39.742 --> 02:48:41.811
ABSOLUTE BENCHMARKS AND THAT IS

02:48:41.878 --> 02:48:44.380
FOR THIS REPORTING YEAR AND

PLANS WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

02:48:47.450 --> 02:48:48.151

02:48:50.820 --> 02:48:52.222
MEDICAID PERCENTILE PERFORMANCE

02:48:52.288 --> 02:48:58.428

02:48:58.495 --> 02:48:58.895
BENCHMARK THAT THAT I

02:48:58.962 --> 02:49:00.530
PERSONALLY FEEL IS A BETTER.

02:49:00.597 --> 02:49:01.564
NEED TO BE DOING THERE ARE

02:49:01.631 --> 02:49:02.131
MEASURES UNFORTUNATELY THAT

02:49:02.198 --> 02:49:02.732
DON'T HAVE THOSE WORKS TODAY

02:49:02.799 --> 02:49:04.067
AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING THROUGH

02:49:04.133 --> 02:49:05.902
HOW DO WE ESTABLISH THOSE SO

02:49:05.969 --> 02:49:07.036
THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT ACROSS

02:49:07.103 --> 02:49:08.538

02:53:17.487 --> 02:53:18.254
AREAS WE KNOW THERE ARE

02:53:18.321 --> 02:53:21.424
POPULATIONS WHERE THEY'RE NOT

02:53:21.491 --> 02:53:24.127
THAT NOT THE CASE AND WE DON'T

02:53:24.193 --> 02:53:26.996
WANT THAT TO GET HIDDEN FOR.

02:53:27.063 --> 02:53:29.031
BREAKING INTO THE BRAND. THAT

02:53:29.098 --> 02:53:29.966
THAT WE NEED TO BE LOOKING. THE

02:53:30.032 --> 02:53:33.536
BASIC THE OUR RECOMMENDATION

02:53:33.603 --> 02:53:34.103
ESTABLISH A NEW REQUIREMENT

02:53:34.170 --> 02:53:35.371
THAT THE PLANS UTILIZED THE

02:53:35.438 --> 02:53:37.573
HEALTH DISPARITIES DATA AS WELL

02:53:37.640 --> 02:53:40.209
AS THE CONSUMER SATISFACTION

02:53:40.276 --> 02:53:42.945
FROM THE CAPS SURVEY TO DEVELOP

02:53:43.012 --> 02:53:44.280
A POPULATION NEEDS ASSESSMENT

02:53:44.347 --> 02:53:46.916
WHICH REALLY WAS AT THE CREATE

02:53:46.983 --> 02:53:50.653
A LITTLE BIT OF DIFFERENT WORDS

02:53:50.720 --> 02:53:51.120
BUT WAS WAS REALLY THE

02:53:51.187 --> 02:53:53.222
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE AUDITOR.

02:53:53.289 --> 02:53:53.790
AND SO THEY'D HAVE TO NEEDS

02:53:53.856 --> 02:53:55.358
ASSESSMENT REALLY LOOKS. ALL

02:53:55.424 --> 02:53:55.925
BUT AT THESE MORE GRANULAR

02:53:55.992 --> 02:53:57.927
LEVEL OF LOOKING AT SPECIFIC

02:53:57.994 --> 02:54:01.063
POPULATIONS AND THAT THEY WOULD

02:54:01.130 --> 02:54:02.198
HAVE TO SUBMIT OF THAT

02:54:02.265 --> 02:54:04.200
POPULATION NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO

02:54:04.267 --> 02:54:05.635
THE DEPARTMENT AND THEN HAVE AN

02:54:05.701 --> 02:54:07.303
ACTION PLAN TO ADDRESS THOSE

02:54:07.370 --> 02:54:10.506
AREAS WERE CLEAR THAT THAT

02:54:10.573 --> 02:54:12.141
THINGS ARE NOT WHERE THEY NEED

02:54:12.208 --> 02:54:15.578
TO BE IT WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT

02:54:15.645 --> 02:54:18.047
FIRST REPORT TO BE DUE TO.

02:54:18.114 --> 02:54:19.649
TWENTY TWENTY. WHERE I FEEL

02:54:19.715 --> 02:54:25.021

02:54:25.087 --> 02:54:25.621
ALSO AND I KNOW CONVERSATIONS

WE'VE HAD WITH THE DOCTOR PAN

02:54:26.289 --> 02:54:26.823
ABOUT INCREASING THE FREQUENCY

02:54:26.889 --> 02:54:28.558
OF THE CAPS SURVEY SO WE ARE

02:54:28.624 --> 02:54:29.725
MOVING THAT FROM EVERY THREE

02:54:29.792 --> 02:54:32.628
YEARS TO EVERY TWO YEARS- AND

02:54:32.695 --> 02:54:34.931
NOT IN A STARTING NOW SO THAT

02:54:34.997 --> 02:54:35.898
WE CAN HAVE THAT MORE REGULARLY.

02:54:35.965 --> 02:54:39.402
AGAIN ANOTHER PLEASE WE'RE WERE

02:54:39.468 --> 02:54:41.070

UTILIZATION HAPPENING AGAIN

02:54:51.948 --> 02:54:53.516
BROKEN DOWN AN APPROPRIATE

02:54:53.583 --> 02:54:55.751

I DON'T OKAY I JUST SAY BRIEFLY

03:01:20.102 --> 03:01:22.504
IT WAS PASSED ACTUALLY AS A

03:01:22.571 --> 03:01:25.307
RESULT OF A VALUATION OF

03:01:25.374 --> 03:01:27.643
DRAFTEES FOR THE VIETNAM WAR

03:01:27.710 --> 03:01:30.546

YOUNG MEN TO FIGHT IN THE

03:01:32.381 --> 03:01:34.950
VIETNAM WAR THAT MANY OF THEM

03:01:35.017 --> 03:01:37.186
WHO COULD NOT QUALIFY FOR

03:01:37.253 --> 03:01:37.786
MILLER SERVICE HAD PREVENTABLE

CONDITIONS. THAT THEY WERE ONLY

03:01:39.622 --> 03:01:41.857
PICKED UP IN CHILDHOOD NOW I

03:01:41.924 --> 03:01:43.592
WILL SAY THAT'S NOT MY MAIN

03:01:43.659 --> 03:01:46.095
PURPOSE FOR TRYING TO DO THIS

03:01:46.161 --> 03:01:49.932
BUT IT WAS A NATIONAL SECURITY

03:01:49.999 --> 03:01:50.532
ISSUE. AND THAT'S WHY CONGRESS

03:01:50.599 --> 03:01:53.535
PASSED THE PS TWO. WE MAKE HERE

03:01:53.602 --> 03:01:54.169
IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THINGS WERE

03:01:54.236 --> 03:01:54.770
TRYING TO ACHIEVE FOR EXAMPLE

03:01:54.837 --> 03:01:57.006
IS- TRAUMA INFORMED CARE WE'RE

HAVE TWO KIDS THAT SAY THEY

03:02:08.851 --> 03:02:10.719
COULD BE SCREEN AND SOME OTHER

03:02:10.786 --> 03:02:12.521
VISITS BUT- THIS IS THOSE

03:02:12.588 --> 03:02:13.255
THAT'S THE PLACE TO BE

03:02:13.322 --> 03:02:15.524
SCREENING SELF. TO ME THIS IS

03:02:15.591 --> 03:02:17.493
VERY TIGHT END WITH OTHER AT

03:02:17.559 --> 03:02:19.695
THAT WE'RE DOING. THE OTHER

03:02:19.762 --> 03:02:21.730
THING I WOULD MAKE NO TO SAY

03:02:21.797 --> 03:02:23.432
LOOK AT OTHERS CHART- SO WE DO

03:02:23.499 --> 03:02:25.134
EMPHASIZE THAT THE YEARS IN

03:02:25.200 --> 03:02:27.036
WHICH THEY AT WHICH THEY ARE

03:02:27.102 --> 03:02:29.271
MONITORED FOR MUCH BETTER

SWITCH WOODS SAYS TO ME THAT.

03:02:33.609 --> 03:02:36.945
WE CAN DO BETTER. WITHOUT THAT

03:02:37.012 --> 03:02:37.579
WE CAN DO EVEN BETTER THAN THAT

03:02:37.646 --> 03:02:38.347
BUT EVEN JUST WHAT WE'RE DOING.

03:02:38.414 --> 03:02:40.449
ACTUALLY FOCUSED BUT WHAT WAS

03:02:40.516 --> 03:02:41.016
PARTICULARLY SCARY HE WAS IS

03:02:41.083 --> 03:02:44.119
THAT. THE NUMBER OF VISITS FOR

03:02:44.186 --> 03:02:47.856
ONE YEAR OLDS. OKAY THINK ABOUT

03:02:47.923 --> 03:02:49.124
ALL DEVELOPMENTAL CHANGES THAT

03:02:49.191 --> 03:02:51.093
HAPPEN IN THAT FIRST THAT SO WE

03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:52.628
WILL TALK ABOUT AUTISM. OTHER

DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONS. IS

03:02:54.630 --> 03:02:59.601

SPECIAL EDUCATION. OTHER PARTS

03:03:08.010 --> 03:03:10.512
OF THE BUDGET DID THEY DID THAT.

03:03:10.579 --> 03:03:12.047
KIDS BEING BEHIND FOR THEIR

03:03:12.114 --> 03:03:13.315
STARTING SCHOOL SOCIAL

03:03:13.382 --> 03:03:21.223
DEVELOPMENT. WE ARE LIKE 25% I

03:03:21.290 --> 03:03:23.692

03:03:23.759 --> 03:03:30.132
OPPORTUNITY. YEAH I THAT THAT

03:03:30.199 --> 03:03:30.733

03:03:30.799 --> 03:03:33.702
TRAVESTY. I THINK THAT THAT IS

03:03:33.769 --> 03:03:36.672
MISS CAVELL NINETEENTH WHEN THE

03:03:36.739 --> 03:03:37.272
REASONS WHY WE NEED TO HAVE A

03:03:37.339 --> 03:03:39.241
VERY STRONG OUT REACH PROGRAM.

03:03:39.308 --> 03:03:41.276

03:03:41.343 --> 03:03:42.111
OTHER THING I WOULD MAKE NOTE

03:03:42.177 --> 03:03:43.312
AND I APPRECIATE THAT THOSE THE

03:03:43.379 --> 03:03:45.581
DEPARTMENTS IS SENDING LETTERS

03:03:45.647 --> 03:03:48.517
AND THE PLANS. THE OTHER PEOPLE

03:03:48.584 --> 03:03:51.787
WE NEED TO AND- IS THAT

03:03:51.854 --> 03:03:52.388
ACTUALLY THE RELATIONSHIP THE

03:03:52.454 --> 03:03:53.856
PATIENT SHOULD HAVE THIS WITH

03:03:53.922 --> 03:03:55.657
THEIR- PHYSICIAN AND OTHER

03:03:55.724 --> 03:03:56.925
PROVIDERS AND THAT. WHEN THEY

03:03:56.992 --> 03:03:59.661
GET THE LETTER FROM THEM. NOW I

03:03:59.728 --> 03:04:01.730
WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT YOU KNOW

03:04:01.797 --> 03:04:03.599
I'M A PROPONENT MANAGED CARE I

03:04:03.665 --> 03:04:06.468
GET FOR MEMBER PER MONTH BUT-

03:04:06.535 --> 03:04:07.469
THESE ARE PREVENTIVE SERVICES

03:04:07.536 --> 03:04:10.672
THAT EVERY CHILD YET. RIGHT I

03:04:10.739 --> 03:04:11.740

SHOULDN'T GET IT. I ASSUME

03:04:13.675 --> 03:04:14.910
THERE'S NO DISAGREEMENT ON

03:04:14.977 --> 03:04:17.413
THAT. I SO IN MANY WAYS ONE

03:04:17.479 --> 03:04:18.814
COULD ARGUE THIS IS NOT

03:04:18.881 --> 03:04:20.349
SOMETHING THAT YOU CAPITATE

03:04:20.416 --> 03:04:22.751
THIS IS LIKE OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT

03:04:22.818 --> 03:04:23.385

TO EVERYONE WHO DOESN'T GET THE

03:04:34.263 --> 03:04:34.797
VISIT WHY ARE THEY BEING PAID

03:04:34.863 --> 03:04:37.366
FOR IT. THEY SHOULD NOT BE ABLE

03:04:37.433 --> 03:04:38.400
TO PAY THAT OFF OF NOT

03:04:38.467 --> 03:04:40.235
PROVIDING CARE. I MEAN THIS IS

03:04:40.302 --> 03:04:42.404
NOT ONE OF THESE WELL WE'RE

03:04:42.471 --> 03:04:43.338
MANAGING THE CARE MAYBE THEY

03:04:43.405 --> 03:04:44.139

CONSEQUENCES WHEN IT COMES TO

03:04:52.548 --> 03:04:53.081
HEALTH SUPERVISION PREVENTION

03:04:53.148 --> 03:04:55.918
LIKE THIS. THE EXPECTATION

03:04:55.984 --> 03:04:58.821
SHOULD BE EVERY CHILD WHO YOU

03:04:58.887 --> 03:05:01.089
ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR SHOULD GET

03:05:01.156 --> 03:05:03.325
THEIR VISIT ON SCHEDULE AND IF

03:05:03.392 --> 03:05:03.959
THEY'RE NOT. WHY WE PAY YOU FOR

03:05:04.026 --> 03:05:10.632
THAT. RIGHT. THAT SHOULD BE THE

03:05:10.699 --> 03:05:12.901
EXPECTATION IT DEFINITELY IS

03:05:12.968 --> 03:05:14.536
THE EXPECTATION I THINK YOU

03:05:14.603 --> 03:05:17.172
KNOW THAT THE COMPLEXITIES OF

03:05:17.239 --> 03:05:20.008
HOW TO DO THAT PARTICULAR I GET

03:05:20.075 --> 03:05:21.777
IT FROM AN ACTUARIAL RATE PER

03:05:21.844 --> 03:05:24.947
UNIT YOU AS WHAT WE WE'VE HAD A

03:05:25.013 --> 03:05:26.548
LOT OF RATE RIGHT CONVERSATIONS

IS ALSO SO. I JUST. NOW AFTER

03:05:29.451 --> 03:05:32.988
WE TALK ABOUT. EIGHT NINETEEN.

03:05:33.055 --> 03:05:33.822
THE EXPECTATIONS SHOULD BE YOUR

03:05:33.889 --> 03:05:34.790
PLAN AND YOU ACTUALLY GET ALL

03:05:34.857 --> 03:05:35.691
YOUR KIDS AND YOU SHOULD NOT BE

03:05:35.757 --> 03:05:36.959
PENALIZED FINANCIALLY FOR THAT

03:05:37.025 --> 03:05:39.061
MOST ACTUARIAL RATE SHOULD NOT

03:05:39.127 --> 03:05:41.129
BE ONE OR EXPECT THEM TO FALL

03:05:41.196 --> 03:05:43.866
OFF. ON THE FLIP SIDE IF

03:05:43.932 --> 03:05:46.668
THEY'RE NOT HITTING THAT. HE

03:05:46.735 --> 03:05:47.636
GET PAID FOR THAT EITHER RIGHT

03:05:47.703 --> 03:05:49.905
I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS WHAT

03:05:49.972 --> 03:05:50.405
THESE IS THAT THE LITTLE

03:05:50.472 --> 03:05:52.774
DIFFERENT THAT WELL YOU KNOW

03:05:52.841 --> 03:05:53.375
YOU HAVE A COLD. DID YOU BRING

03:05:53.442 --> 03:05:55.410
INTO THE ARE NOT OKAY. RIGHT WE

03:05:55.477 --> 03:05:56.011
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S REALLY COLD

03:05:56.078 --> 03:05:56.578
OR SOMETHING MORE SERIOUS I

03:05:56.645 --> 03:05:57.412
MEAN THERE'S A LOT. I GET THAT

03:05:57.479 --> 03:05:59.915
FOR THE MAD YOU KNOW THE

03:05:59.982 --> 03:06:00.482
MANAGED CARE PART OF IT BUT

03:06:00.549 --> 03:06:01.083
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PREVENTIVE

03:06:01.149 --> 03:06:01.683
SERVICES. THE STANDARDS PRETTY

03:06:01.750 --> 03:06:06.889
CLEAR RIGHT. SO THAT SO

03:06:06.955 --> 03:06:08.690
HOPEFULLY WE THAT THERE SHOULD

03:06:08.757 --> 03:06:10.225
BE SOME CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

03:06:10.292 --> 03:06:11.159
THAT WHEN IT COMES VERY

03:06:11.226 --> 03:06:12.327
SPECIFICALLY TO THIS TYPE OF

03:06:12.394 --> 03:06:18.200
SERVICE CORRECT. OKAY. RIGHT

03:06:18.267 --> 03:06:20.068
DID YOU AT SOME REAL BUT THAT

03:06:20.135 --> 03:06:21.837
THE CHAIR WOULD IT JUST I JUST-

03:06:21.904 --> 03:06:23.939
PERSON FOR SMALLER APOLOGIZE

03:06:24.006 --> 03:06:26.775
FOR MYTARDINESS BUT I'D I WANT

03:06:26.842 --> 03:06:28.076
TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT BECAUSE I

03:06:28.143 --> 03:06:30.178
THINK THAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF

03:06:30.245 --> 03:06:32.147
THESE KIDS NOT GETTING THE CARE

03:06:32.214 --> 03:06:34.249
AT THE RIGHT TIME. IS POTENTIAL

03:06:34.316 --> 03:06:36.018
BIGGER EXPENSE ON THE OUT IT

03:06:36.084 --> 03:06:37.586
IT'S JUST WHAT HE'S TALKING

03:06:37.653 --> 03:06:40.289
ABOUT AND THAT'S AND I THINK TO

03:06:40.355 --> 03:06:41.189
ME THAT'S ONE MORE SHOCKING

03:06:41.256 --> 03:06:42.658
PARTS OF THIS IS LIKE WHOA WAIT

03:06:42.724 --> 03:06:43.659
A SECOND HERE IT'S A MISSED

03:06:43.725 --> 03:06:46.862
OPPORTUNITY. TO INTERVENE EARLY

03:06:46.929 --> 03:06:47.963
AND PROTECT THESE KIDS GOING

03:06:48.030 --> 03:06:51.400
FORWARD SO- I'D I HAVE BEEN

03:06:51.466 --> 03:06:53.101
HERE FOR ALL THIS OBVIOUSLY BUT

03:06:53.168 --> 03:06:54.937
I JUST THE I THINK THE NEXUS

03:06:55.003 --> 03:06:56.405
BETWEEN. BIGGER OUT THAT COSTS

03:06:56.471 --> 03:06:58.974
IN THE IN THE OUTLYING YEARS.

03:06:59.041 --> 03:07:00.809
AND THE MISSED OPPORTUNITY TAKE

03:07:00.876 --> 03:07:02.210
CARE OF KIDS- THERE OUGHT TO BE

03:07:02.277 --> 03:07:04.780
ACCOUNTABILITY ON BOTH. WITH

03:07:04.846 --> 03:07:08.283
THE PLANS AND WITH US FOR NOT

03:07:08.350 --> 03:07:14.489
MAKING IT HAPPEN. AND I THINK

03:07:14.556 --> 03:07:15.891
THE OTHER PART YOU KNOW WOULD

03:07:15.958 --> 03:07:16.925
WE AND I THINK IT'S ALSO

03:07:16.992 --> 03:07:18.093
IMPORTANT AND THEN DELVES MUCH

03:07:18.160 --> 03:07:21.330
INTO IS THAT MY GUESS IS THAT

03:07:21.396 --> 03:07:21.763
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

03:07:21.830 --> 03:07:22.364
PERCENTAGES THE PEOPLE AREN'T

03:07:22.431 --> 03:07:23.665
GETTING IT. YOU KNOW WHO ARE

03:07:23.732 --> 03:07:26.001
THEY- WHY ARE THEY NOT. YOU

03:07:26.068 --> 03:07:27.569
KNOW WE SEE THE DISPARITIES OF

03:07:27.636 --> 03:07:28.604
PEOPLE SPEAKING DIFFERENT

03:07:28.670 --> 03:07:32.174
LANGUAGES AND- AND SO FORTH SO

03:07:32.240 --> 03:07:35.644
YOU KNOW THAT'S- THAT AS WELL

03:07:35.711 --> 03:07:38.146
SO WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE-

03:07:38.213 --> 03:07:40.482
SET THAT LEVEL ACCOUNTABILITY

03:07:40.549 --> 03:07:43.652
AND BUT ALSO YOU KNOW ARE WE.

03:07:43.719 --> 03:07:45.087
HOW WE DESIGNED THE SYSTEM IN A

03:07:45.153 --> 03:07:47.222
WAY THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY

03:07:58.934 --> 03:08:00.802

THAT'S AS TIMELY AS POSSIBLE

03:24:48.643 --> 03:24:50.277

GETTING BACK. ON THAT AND THEN

03:25:05.660 --> 03:25:06.160
HOW WE CAN POTENTIALLY MOVE

THAT UP FOR WHAT. IT COULD BE

03:25:09.363 --> 03:25:09.864
EARLY I DON'T ACTUALLY JUST

03:25:09.930 --> 03:25:10.431
KNOW THAT OFF THE TOP OF MY

03:25:10.498 --> 03:25:14.101

03:25:16.203 --> 03:25:18.673
TENURE PROVIDERS HOW'S THE OUT

03:25:18.739 --> 03:25:19.540
REACH BEEN AND HOW IT'S BEING

03:25:19.607 --> 03:25:21.475
RECEIVED BY PROVIDERS. IT'S

03:25:21.542 --> 03:25:23.911
INCONSISTENT SO WE REACHED OUT

TO OUR LEADERSHIP AND SOME HAVE

03:25:28.382 --> 03:25:28.883
HEARD FROM THEIR HEALTH PLAN

03:25:28.949 --> 03:25:32.586

GET OUT TO MEMBERS IS VARIABLE

03:25:46.767 --> 03:25:51.972
SO. THERE'S A LOT OF. DIFFUSION

03:25:52.039 --> 03:25:53.074
OF RESPONSIBILITY I GUESS

03:25:53.140 --> 03:25:55.643
BETWEEN BETWEEN ALL THE PARTY

03:25:55.710 --> 03:25:57.344

STATE IN THE AND PROVIDERS I

03:25:58.512 --> 03:26:01.148

03:26:04.618 --> 03:26:05.286
DOING BETTER IN THAT

03:26:05.352 --> 03:26:07.855
COMMUNICATION ANOTHER- ARE HARD

03:26:07.922 --> 03:26:08.723
TO SAY IN OUR IN OUR IN OUR

03:26:08.789 --> 03:26:12.293
SURVEY IT'S IT. IT DOESN'T SEEM

TO BE A SPECIFIC PATTERN. WHAT

03:26:17.331 --> 03:26:18.232
DO YOU THINK INCREASES

03:26:18.299 --> 03:26:20.267
PREVENTIVE SERVICES IN YOUR

03:26:20.334 --> 03:26:22.870

YEAH BECAUSE WHAT IS IT THAT

03:26:28.075 --> 03:26:30.244
WHAT IS IT THAT INCREASES

03:26:30.311 --> 03:26:32.480

THE CODE INTO TWO SO ONE THAT'S

03:33:48.081 --> 03:33:51.919
MAYBE LOWER RISK- AND THEN

03:33:51.985 --> 03:33:53.587
WHERE ARE THE HIGHER RISK WHERE

03:34:17.778 --> 03:34:20.414
WE REALLY TRACK THOSE AND-

03:34:20.480 --> 03:34:21.582
REALLY THOSE ARE THE THINGS

03:34:21.648 --> 03:34:22.916
WE'RE LOOKING AT PARTICULARLY

03:34:22.983 --> 03:34:23.784
ALSO WITH THE DEVELOPMENTAL

03:34:23.850 --> 03:34:29.656
SCREENINGS OF. OF GREETING

03:34:29.723 --> 03:34:33.160
HAPPEN. NOW IT'S GOING. WITHIN

03:34:33.227 --> 03:34:33.961
THE PURVIEW OF THE MANAGED CARE

03:34:34.027 --> 03:34:34.728
PLAN TO BE PROVIDING THAT

03:34:34.795 --> 03:34:35.462
FOLLOW UP SERVICE BUT IT IS

03:34:35.529 --> 03:34:36.964
THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. AND AGAIN

03:34:37.030 --> 03:34:37.531
THAT SORT OF MORE PROVIDER

03:34:37.598 --> 03:34:38.398
BASED ON THE GROUND PERSON TO

03:34:38.465 --> 03:34:39.866
PROVIDE THE APPROPRIATE

03:34:39.933 --> 03:34:41.101
REFERRAL AND THEN MAKING SURE

03:34:41.168 --> 03:34:42.035
WE'RE CONNECTING THAT DATA.

03:34:42.102 --> 03:34:43.971
REFERRAL HAPPENED MAYBE DID IF

03:34:44.037 --> 03:34:45.038

THE FOR ALL HAPPENED NOTHING

03:34:46.506 --> 03:34:47.774
HAPPENED FROM THAT REFERRAL HOW

03:34:47.841 --> 03:34:49.009
DO WE ALSO ADDRESS THAT SO I

03:34:49.076 --> 03:34:51.011
THINK. A LOT OF THOSE THINGS

03:34:51.078 --> 03:34:52.846
ARE ARE ARE WHAT WE'RE TRYING

03:34:52.913 --> 03:34:54.414
TO LOOK AT AND THE DATA IT

03:34:54.481 --> 03:34:55.649
IMPORTANT IN BEING ABLE TO

03:34:55.716 --> 03:34:58.151
ASSESS THAT. I WOULD ALSO SAY

03:34:58.218 --> 03:34:59.486
ALTHOUGH IT HADN'T BEEN A

03:34:59.553 --> 03:35:02.022
PARTICULAR. PIECE THAT YOU

03:35:02.089 --> 03:35:02.522
HEARD ME MENTION ON THE

03:35:02.589 --> 03:35:06.760
OUTREACH SIDE. BUT HOW DO WE

03:35:06.827 --> 03:35:08.262
NOT JUST HAVE THE PLAN TO BE

03:35:08.328 --> 03:35:10.030
DOING OUTREACH BUT HOW PUSH

03:35:10.097 --> 03:35:12.065
THAT DEBT TO THE PROVIDER LEVEL

03:35:12.132 --> 03:35:15.135
MAKING SURE THEY HAVE THE

03:35:15.202 --> 03:35:18.105
INFORMATION THAT MADE THAT MAY

03:35:18.171 --> 03:35:23.844
NEED TO REACH. OUT AND I SAVE.

03:35:23.910 --> 03:35:30.717
THE SORT OF WHEN YOU. IN MY

03:35:30.784 --> 03:35:33.253
LOOK. WHY IS THE CHALLENGES

03:35:33.320 --> 03:35:34.554
THAT WE HAVE WITH. ACCURATE

03:35:34.621 --> 03:35:35.489
CAUGHT HIM FOR MISSION FOR

03:35:35.555 --> 03:35:36.490
FAMILIES AND MEDI CAL AND-

03:35:36.556 --> 03:35:38.025
KNOWING THAT THE PROVIDER LEVEL

03:35:38.091 --> 03:35:38.592
TYPICALLY HAS THE BEST PLANS

03:35:38.659 --> 03:35:39.593
HAVE THE NEXT BEST. BUT IT'S

03:35:39.660 --> 03:35:40.560
NOT OFTEN CONSISTENT AND NOT

03:35:40.627 --> 03:35:41.628
OFTEN EASILY SHARED BECAUSE OF

03:35:41.695 --> 03:35:42.696
OUR DATA SYSTEM LIMITATIONS

03:35:42.763 --> 03:35:43.697
AND- REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO

03:35:43.764 --> 03:35:44.965
WORKING WITH FOLKS ON. HOW DO

03:35:45.032 --> 03:35:45.499
WE OBVIOUSLY MAINTAIN THE

03:35:45.565 --> 03:35:46.033
PRIVACY THAT NEEDS TO BE

03:35:46.099 --> 03:35:47.534
MAINTAINED. BUT MAKE SURE THAT

03:35:47.601 --> 03:35:49.403
OUR HEALTH PLANS ARE PROVIDERS

03:35:49.469 --> 03:35:50.470
ARE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

03:35:50.537 --> 03:35:52.105
FOLKS ALL HAVE THE INFORMATION

03:35:52.172 --> 03:35:55.375
ON HOW TO ACTUALLY REACH.

03:35:55.442 --> 03:35:59.146
BENEFIT WHETHER. WHAT I'M OUT

03:35:59.212 --> 03:36:00.147
HERE FOR KIDS BUT EVEN ADULTS

03:36:00.213 --> 03:36:01.348
WE CAN'T IF WE DON'T IF THEY

03:36:01.415 --> 03:36:02.449
CAN'T BE LOCATED BECAUSE OUR

03:36:02.516 --> 03:36:03.750

03:36:03.817 --> 03:36:04.318
APPROPRIATELY THAT'S A HUGE

03:36:04.384 --> 03:36:05.018
PROBLEM AND SO. I WOULD SAY

03:36:05.085 --> 03:36:06.720
AGAIN THAT'S ANOTHER AREA WHERE

03:36:06.787 --> 03:36:08.588
I THINK IF WE CAN IMPROVE THAT

03:36:08.655 --> 03:36:10.957
AND FIND A MORE STREAMLINED WAY

03:36:11.024 --> 03:36:12.059
TO DO THAT. IT WILL HELP

03:36:12.125 --> 03:36:13.794

QUALITY LOWER COST ETCETERA

03:37:10.784 --> 03:37:11.218
IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT THE

03:37:11.284 --> 03:37:14.454
RELATIONSHIP. SO WHEN PEOPLE

NATIONAL AVERAGE IS 50% THAT'S

03:37:46.052 --> 03:37:49.055
THE AVERAGE WE CAN DO BETTER

03:37:49.122 --> 03:37:49.656

03:41:12.258 --> 03:41:15.962
FOR AND. TO BE A CALL AND THEN

03:41:16.029 --> 03:41:17.030
WE WORKED WITH THE AGENCY- ON

03:41:17.097 --> 03:41:18.898
VERY SPECIFIC- DIRECTION TO THE

03:41:18.965 --> 03:41:20.800
PLANS. ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE TO

03:41:20.867 --> 03:41:22.969
DO I'M REALLY TO MEDICATIONS

03:41:23.036 --> 03:41:23.503
ALL IT MAY TALK ABOUT THAT

03:41:23.570 --> 03:41:25.405
PROCESS. I FEEL LIKE A COVERED

03:41:25.472 --> 03:41:27.173
A LOT OF IT BUT- I THINK I GOT

03:41:27.240 --> 03:41:28.642
A FEW VERY SPECIFIC THINGS

03:41:28.708 --> 03:41:30.610
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE GREAT PLAN

03:41:30.677 --> 03:41:32.512
PARTNERS TO GET WHO CARE VERY

03:41:32.579 --> 03:41:33.780
MUCH ABOUT THEIR POPULATIONS

03:41:33.847 --> 03:41:35.915
AND SO. WHAT WE SAW AND WHAT

03:41:35.982 --> 03:41:37.250
OUR DIRECTION WAS IS

03:41:37.317 --> 03:41:37.684
PARTICULARLY ON THE

03:41:37.751 --> 03:41:40.120
PRESCRIPTION DRUG SIDE- YOU

03:41:40.186 --> 03:41:43.089
KNOW PEOPLE MIGHT NOT HAVE

03:41:43.156 --> 03:41:43.657
THEIR SCRIPT THE MIGHT HAVE

03:41:43.723 --> 03:41:44.290
LEFT IT AT YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT

03:41:44.357 --> 03:41:45.959
IS. OPENING UP AND NOT HAVING

03:41:46.026 --> 03:41:47.527
TO TREAT. THE REQUIREMENTS SO

03:41:47.594 --> 03:41:48.628
THAT PEOPLE COULD HAVE BOTH

03:41:48.695 --> 03:41:50.163
EMERGENCY SUPPLIES BUT IF. IF

03:41:50.230 --> 03:41:52.132
IT'S NEEDED LONGER TO DO THAT

03:41:52.198 --> 03:41:53.466
WE OBVIOUSLY RECOGNIZE IF YOU

03:41:53.533 --> 03:41:55.168
DON'T HAVE ACCESS. AND YOU

03:41:55.235 --> 03:41:56.269
DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE YOUR

03:41:56.336 --> 03:41:58.905
MEDICATION. WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN

03:41:58.972 --> 03:42:01.241
IS YOU KNOW COULD BE.

03:42:01.307 --> 03:42:02.308
ULTIMATELY DYING AND

03:42:02.375 --> 03:42:03.410
PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU THINK OF

03:42:03.476 --> 03:42:04.911
SOME OF YOU KNOW THE MORE

03:42:04.978 --> 03:42:06.913
CHALLENGING THE CHALLENGING

I THINK WE HAVE YOU KNOW.

03:42:31.504 --> 03:42:35.308
UNFORTUNATELY BUT IN THE CASE

03:42:35.375 --> 03:42:36.910
OF NOW HAVING LEARNED FROM THE

03:42:36.976 --> 03:42:39.145
FIRES IN A COUPLE OF YEARS

03:42:39.212 --> 03:42:42.749
REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW TO

03:42:42.816 --> 03:42:45.418
WORK WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

03:42:45.485 --> 03:42:46.019

STATE TO PROVIDE SERVICE THAT

03:42:49.622 --> 03:42:50.123
AT THE STATE BECAUSE- WE CAN

03:42:50.190 --> 03:42:50.724
GET FEDERAL FUNDING FOR WHEN

EACH YOU KNOW ARE YOU SAFETY

03:43:24.557 --> 03:43:26.126
UNIQUE THING. BUT WE ARE

03:43:26.192 --> 03:43:28.428

WHO SURVIVE ON THINGS THAT ARE

03:43:46.146 --> 03:43:47.147
POWER ELECTRICITY AND TYPICALLY

WE'VE BEEN SEEING WITH THESE

03:43:51.184 --> 03:43:52.152
POWER SHOT OFFICES HOURS ISN'T

03:43:52.218 --> 03:43:54.254
IS NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING AND SO

03:43:54.320 --> 03:43:57.223
HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT FROM A

03:43:57.290 --> 03:43:59.993
FEDERAL MEDICAID PERSPECTIVE.

03:44:00.059 --> 03:44:00.527
IS THE POTENTIAL FOR REAM.

03:44:00.593 --> 03:44:01.928
GENERATORS AND OTHER THINGS

03:44:01.995 --> 03:44:03.196
LIKE THAT SO WE ARE LOOKING

03:44:03.263 --> 03:44:05.298
INTO THAT THAT IS SORT OF A NEW

03:44:05.365 --> 03:44:07.233
IS NEWER ISSUE FOR US WITH

03:44:07.300 --> 03:44:09.302
THESE. SORT OF PS PS THINGS

03:44:09.369 --> 03:44:10.737
GOING ON FOR DAYS BUT

03:44:10.804 --> 03:44:12.806
DEFINITELY SOMETHING ON OUR

03:44:12.872 --> 03:44:14.374
LIST TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT

03:44:14.440 --> 03:44:18.077
OBVIOUSLY THE- THESE ARE PEOPLE

03:44:18.144 --> 03:44:21.447
WHO WE WANT TO TAKE CARE OF. WE

03:44:21.514 --> 03:44:24.050
DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM HARMED

03:44:24.117 --> 03:44:25.819
OR OR WORSE PARTICULARLY WHEN

03:44:25.885 --> 03:44:28.588
IT. OUR OUR- AND THERE IS

03:44:28.655 --> 03:44:30.023
SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO ABOUT

03:44:30.089 --> 03:44:31.357
IT. YEAH I WOULD I WOULD JUST

03:44:31.424 --> 03:44:32.225
END BY SAYING YOU KNOW WE ARE

03:44:32.292 --> 03:44:34.427
NOT THE LEADER THAN AGENCY BUT

03:44:34.494 --> 03:44:36.529
WE WERE ACTIVELY ENGAGED. I

03:44:36.596 --> 03:44:38.031
THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY WILL BE

03:44:38.097 --> 03:44:40.934
A VERY- ACTIVE AND ROBUST-

03:44:41.000 --> 03:44:43.670
AFTER IN CENTER AFTER EVENT.

03:44:43.736 --> 03:44:45.939
ANALYSIS TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT WE

03:44:46.005 --> 03:44:49.776
MORE- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IS AN

03:44:49.843 --> 03:44:50.944
ISSUE NOTED IT DOES APPEAR

03:44:51.010 --> 03:44:52.812
THESE LOCKER. THE SERVER IN A

03:44:52.879 --> 03:44:56.149
VERY SHORT TERM ON A MORE OFTEN

03:44:56.216 --> 03:44:59.953
THAN ANYBODY BUT LIKE SO. YEAH

03:45:00.019 --> 03:45:01.120
JUST JUST JUST. UP AS SOMEONE

03:45:01.187 --> 03:45:01.688
WHO'S FRESH OFF OF SOME OF

03:45:01.754 --> 03:45:05.458
THESE EXPERIENCES- IT WAS IT

03:45:05.525 --> 03:45:06.059
WAS HAPPENING LIVE WHEN I WAS

03:45:06.125 --> 03:45:08.161
VISITING WITH YOU IN OFFICE

03:45:08.228 --> 03:45:08.695
LAST WEEK. WAS A MATTER OF

03:45:08.761 --> 03:45:12.065
FAITH. I THINK- IT ONE OF THE

03:45:12.131 --> 03:45:14.033
CONCERNS I HAVE IS THE LONG

03:45:14.100 --> 03:45:17.637
TERM- FOR EXAMPLE- AND CITY

03:45:17.704 --> 03:45:21.274
SANTA ROSA VISTA CLINIC- JUST

03:45:21.341 --> 03:45:23.509
RE OPENED- AFTER TWO YEARS

03:45:23.576 --> 03:45:24.677
BEING CLOSE SPEAKS OF THE TOP

03:45:24.744 --> 03:45:27.146
FIVE- AND THEN WAS AND THEN WAS

03:45:27.213 --> 03:45:28.047
THREATENED AGAIN BY THE CAN

03:45:28.114 --> 03:45:32.685
KICK FIRE. SO YOU KNOW I THINK

03:45:32.752 --> 03:45:33.419
THEY'RE GONNA HAPPEN YOU KNOW.

03:45:33.486 --> 03:45:33.987
HOUSE THERE'S AND THINGS ARE

03:45:34.053 --> 03:45:36.155
GOING GOING TO HAVE CHALLENGES

03:45:36.222 --> 03:45:39.025
BUT I THINK. IN THE LONG RUN-

03:45:39.092 --> 03:45:40.260
DUMBARTON ARE MORE VULNERABLE

03:45:40.326 --> 03:45:42.929
DESPITE POPULATION ARE GOING TO

03:45:42.996 --> 03:45:44.530
BE DISPLAYED I'M WERE SEEN SEE

03:45:47.100 --> 03:45:52.105
SECURE. AS PEOPLE OF LOST MAYBE

03:45:52.171 --> 03:45:55.341
JUST ONE BUT TWO. ENTIRE

03:45:55.408 --> 03:45:58.244
REFRIGERATORS FULL- AND SO I

03:45:58.311 --> 03:45:58.778
THINK THAT'S WHERE THE OUT

03:45:58.845 --> 03:46:00.513
REACH. IN SOME. FIRE IMPACTED

03:46:00.580 --> 03:46:01.147
AREAS ARE GONNA NEED TO BE RE

03:46:01.214 --> 03:46:02.482
DOUBLE BECAUSE THE LAST THING

03:46:02.548 --> 03:46:04.183
ON SOMEONE'S MIND IS LIKE.

03:46:04.250 --> 03:46:05.051
GETTING THERE TO PREVENTIVE

03:46:05.118 --> 03:46:05.818
VISIT THAT THEY MAY NOT EVEN

03:46:05.885 --> 03:46:06.419
KNOW EXISTED THEY DIDN'T EVEN

03:46:06.486 --> 03:46:07.320
KNOW THEY TO DO THAT. AND I DO

03:46:07.387 --> 03:46:08.588
HAVE I DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT

03:46:08.655 --> 03:46:10.757
CONCERNS BECAUSE- WHAT MOST

03:46:10.823 --> 03:46:11.624
PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM PROBABLY

LIVING AT- IN IN A SIGNIFICANT

03:46:16.930 --> 03:46:19.999
SECTION OF ONE OF MY COUNTIES.

03:46:20.066 --> 03:46:20.633
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE ASKED BACK

03:46:20.700 --> 03:46:23.403
YET. SO YOU TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW.

03:46:23.469 --> 03:46:25.405
YEAH TAKING CARE OF EQUIPMENT

03:46:25.471 --> 03:46:26.572
AND THINGS AND ONE PHARMACIST

03:46:26.639 --> 03:46:28.341
IN THE WEST PARTISAN AS CINEMA

03:46:28.408 --> 03:46:30.910
COUNTY- COULDN'T GET IS GAS

03:46:30.977 --> 03:46:33.313

EXTRA. NIGHTS WITHOUT HEATING

03:46:38.851 --> 03:46:41.688
IN HIS HOUSE SO THESE ARE THESE

03:46:41.754 --> 03:46:44.390
ARE BIGGER PICTURE ITEMS THAT

03:46:44.457 --> 03:46:46.492
NONE OF US EXPECTED TO HAVE TO

ENSURING THAT HAPPENS BUT BUT I

03:46:53.366 --> 03:46:54.200
THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT'S

03:46:54.267 --> 03:46:56.135
GOING TO HAPPEN IN OTHER PARTS

03:46:56.202 --> 03:46:58.538

03:47:15.688 --> 03:47:16.990

THINGS THAT I THINK IT'S A

03:52:01.073 --> 03:52:01.674
VERY. QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER WE

03:52:25.965 --> 03:52:26.565
