YES WE CAN- WONDERFUL I I'VE ACCOMPLISHED THE BIGGEST TASK KNOWING HOW TO WORK WITH. AFTER I WAS THERE REALLY COUNTS SO THAT'S GREAT BUT CONGRATULATIONS MISTER GORE NINE YOUR I'LL CLING TO THAT. ON YOUR RESUME SPEAKS- WONDERS IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO BRING TO I THINK A MYRIAD OF PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE HAD AT THE DMV. EVEN IN PARTICULAR IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASPECTS ARE BETTER ACCEPTED OF MANY ITEMS AND PROBABLY FIRST ON MY LIST OF STUFF MOTOR VOTER SITUATION AND JOB GET A FEW COMMENTS ON THE BALLOT IF YOU WOULD ABOUT HOW YOU'RE APPROACHING OUT SINCE WE HAD. A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS SPECIFICALLY ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE REGISTERED FOR A PARTY THEY DIDN'T USED TO BE AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY ACTUALLY THAT WAS BIPARTISAN WENT BACK AND FORTH AND THEN I NUMBER YOU WERE- ACTUALLY- I GUESS REGISTER TO VOTE WHEN PROBABLY THEY DIDN'T REALLY MEET THE QUALIFICATIONS TO DO THAT. SO IF YOU COULD SHARE WITH ME ON YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT I KNOW IT'S PROBABLY STILL GOING FORWARD- THAT WOULD BE GREAT NEED TO HEAR THAT AND I THINK OUR PUBLIC NEEDS TO HEAR THAT. AND SECONDLY I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE HEARING IN OUR DISTRICT LEVEL AND YOU CAN IMAGINE YOU'RE PROBABLY HEARING IT YOURSELF. THE PROBLEM WITH SADDAM. WE ARE IN DRIVING TO FOR OUR- OUR PROBABLY ARE TEENAGE IMPROVE. THAT HAVE BEEN PUT Q. AND DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY'LL GET BACK YEAH. AND ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SHOT YOU WANT OPEN OUT TIME FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO DRIVE. IN THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM FOR FAMILIES ON MISTER GORDON AS OUR PARENTS GO BACK TO WORK. AS BUSINESSES ARE OPENING IN CHILDREN WILL BE RESPONSIBLE- FOR GETTING THEMSELVES WHERE THEY NEED TO GO. ON THAT I THINK YOU'RE ALL COUNTY NOT GOING OUT JOHNNY CAN DRIVE YOU KNOW GET MAYBE JOHNNY WILL BE ABLE TO SO. I'M TRYING TO BE ABLE TO ACCELERATE THAT. IN THE NEAR TERM- OF AB CONTRACTING OUT WITH ARE SAFE DRIVING SCHOOLS WHATEVER MIGHT BE ON YOUR MIND ANNUAL THEY HAVE DONE THAT IN THE STATE OF COLORADO. SO THOSE TWO ISSUES ARE HIGH ON MY LIST. AND LOOKING AT YOUR RESUME I THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT YOU WILL BE VERY ACCOMPLISHED OUT. OF YOU KNOW DEALING SO. EITHER GIVING YOU A HIGH FIVE SO LET'S HEAR. WHAT YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP ME WITH. THANK YOU SAID OUT PRECIADO. THE CONFIDENCE. I'M MOTOR VOTER ON AS THAT MANY OF YOUR- THE- PROGRAM HAS TO START UP SAID THAT'S KIND OF HOW I THINK EITHER ERNST AND YOUNG ASSESSMENT THAT WAS JUST UNDER WAY WHEN I WHEN I JOINED. REALLY I HIGHLIGHTED I THINK TWO THINGS ONE IS THERE IS A GOVERNMENT ISSUE BETWEEN THE VARIOUS PARTIES PRIMARILY THE DMV AND THE SECRETARY OF STATE. AND I MET WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE AND WE HAD I THINK A REALLY GOOD CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT GOVERNMENT'S MAKING SURE THERE'S CLEAR COMMUNICATION ABOUT WHAT THE SCOPE IS. TESTED WHO TEST WHAT WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE. AND I THINK WE FOUND DOES TO. CLARIFYING THE SCOPE HAVING VERY FREQUENT MEETINGS CERTAINLY AND THE AND IN THE EARLY WEEKS. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REALLY TIGHTEN UP OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE ON. SO I THINK RIGHT IS WHAT I'VE SEEN IS THAT. FROM THAT THE GOVERNMENT BETWEEN THE TWO ARMOS THINGS ARE WORKING AS AS WELL AS THEY'VE EVER DONE AND WE'RE SEEING THAT. THINGS MAKE AN INTRODUCTION RELEASE IS BEING MADE. WITH NO DEFECTS IN AND THAT'S CERTAINLY A VERY DIFFERENT. FEELING THAN WHAT IT WAS SIX MONTHS AGO I THINK THE TEAM IS WORKING WERE THERE AWHILE TOGETHER. A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY. AND BUT I THINK RIGHT NOW THINGS ARE GOING WELL ON THE OPERATION SIDE AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOUR QUESTION SENATOR- ABOUT. SOME OF THESE. ISSUES BUT THE ARMY OPERATIONS I WHICH IS THE OTHER FAT FAST ENOUGH TO SAY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- HOPE THAT. AS SERIOUSLY AS IT NEEDED TO BE AND WE ALSO. RECEIVED FUNDING FROM THE GENERAL FUND WHICH IS WHERE IT SHOULD BE FUNDED. WE HAVE DEDICATED TEAM TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PROCESS WORKS. AS EFFICIENTLY AS AGAIN THERE ARE. FEDERAL GUIDELINES. OF DAYS. PROCESS THE TEAM HAS PUT RIGHT MEASURES IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE THOSE THINGS MAKE IT THROUGH THE SYSTEM TO THE SECRETARY STATE AND EVENTUALLY TO THE REGISTER VOTERS WITHIN THE TIME FRAMES- DICTATED BY LAW IT'S NOT PROCESS HAS BEEN VERY WELL MEASURED OF LATE- IN AGAIN VERY WELL EXECUTED OF LATE I THINK THE TEAM IS FIXED. TWO OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS CAN GOVERNOR'S BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENTS AND MAKING SURE OPERATIONALLY THAT WHERE WE HAVE OUR AYE IF YOU WILL ON THE BALL NOW I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERNS RAISED BY SOME SOME PARTS WHERE- SOMETHING HAD CHANGED SO AND I KNOW THAT THE PROCESS IS- IS A BIT CONFUSING ABOUT. WHEN YOU'RE A SE. REQUESTING A DUPLICATE DRIVER'S LICENSE OR DOING A CHANGE OF ADDRESS WHERE WE TAKE YOU THROUGH THE- THE MOTOR VOTER PROCESS AGAIN. AND TO THE BEST COMPLEX AND WE'RE WORKING TO SIMPLIFY IT. THE ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT FORWARD OUT FROM- VARIOUS GOT CONSTITUENTS IN THE FIELD I THINK HAVE BEEN. LOOKING THAT OUR DEPARTMENT I THINK ALSO THROUGH THE SECRETARY STATE. I'M NOT SURE WE FOUND. MANY IF ANY AND I APOLOGIZE. IF THERE ARE SOME THAT YOU'RE AWARE BUT- WHERE YOU KNOW WE ARE SOME SOMEHOW INADVERTENTLY THINGS WERE CHANGED. BUT BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PROCESS IS WHAT I'M LOOKING AT IT. THAT IT'S VERY EASY TO. NOT KEEP YOUR MOTOR VOTER PREFERENCES STATIC WHEN YOU DON'T WANT TO CHANGES I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S COMING OUT IN A FUTURE RELEASE SO THAT. WE WON'T. NOBODY WILL HAVE. BE BE CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT WHAT BUT DISLIKE ON AND SO ON SO I THINK AGAIN. A HIGH LEVEL OF THE MOTOR VOTER IS IN A VERY VERY GOOD STATE WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WATCH FOR THOSE ITEMS THAT YOU MENTIONED. WE. TAKE THIS VERY SERIOUSLY AS I WAS CONCERNED. COME IN AND MAKE SURE THAT WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF ISSUES SO THAT. IF THERE IS A DEFECT OF SOME SORT THAT WE ADDRESS THAT. NOW YOU TALK ABOUT TRIED TO **** DRIVE JUST IS LIKE THE NUMBER ONE EMAIL THAT I GET. AND I DO RESPONDED MANY BECAUSE REGION I'M NOT ASKING FOR MORE FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS BUT- IT'S REALLY GOOD TO BE. IN TOUCH WITH OUR WITH OUR COMMUNITY. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN FACT WE DO RESPOND APPROPRIATELY I'M DR DOES HELP. S WE OPEN UP OUR NEXT WE'VE LOST AS WE'VE BEEN OPENING IN THREE WAYS THE NEXT WAVE OPEN SOMETIME MIDDLE OF THIS MONTH. AND THAT WILL START TO INCLUDE DRIVE COUSIN. WHY WE PUT THAT IN THE LAST PHASES SOCIAL DISTANCING WHILE ON A CAR IS CHALLENGING RIGHT. IT'S A WE'RE TRYING TO GET THE RIGHT PP IN PLACE THE RECORD FEATURES IN PLACE. AS A LOT OF PRE AND POST WE'RE GONNA TEST. BUT WE BELIEVE WILL HAVE THAT STOOD UP. THIS MONTH. AND THEN WE'VE- ALSO STREAMLINED THE PROCESS SO WE HAVE THINGS THAT ARE DRIVE BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD NORMALLY DO. YES SOUP TO NUTS IN THE PROCESS WE NOW. SEPARATE IS SOME OF THAT WORK SO THEY CAN STAY FOCUSED ON THE DRIVE HAS TO BE EFFICIENT. GET A FEW MORE DRIVES IN EVERY DAY. AND SO THAT'S GOING TO HELP I THINK. WORK OFF THE EXISTING DEPLOYMENTS IN THE BACKLOG AND ALLOW FOR MORE POINTS HAPPEN IN THE NEAR FUTURE. AND WE ARE. SENATOR TEACH YOUR COMMENTS WE ARE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH. PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO SEE IF WE CAN ACTUALLY IS. I TRIED TO SCHOOLS PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA HAVE. VERY VERY. STRONG BACKGROUNDS NO NO DIDN'T IF YOU WILL TO MARRIAGE AGAINST NOPE NO. REPORT OF PROBLEMS. OR ALSO LOOKING AT THAT YEAH TELL. AND THERE'S A LOT OF REALLY GREAT TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN TELL YOU. HOW YOU'RE DRIVING HOW WHILE YOU'RE DRIVING- XCELERATED DECELERATING AND SO ON. AND FROM THAT COULD BE A PROXY FOR SAFETY. IT'S MASS NOT READY FOR PRIMETIME THE DMB WE ARE ACTIVELY LOOKING AT THAT SO. MAYBE EVEN A CONCERT WITH DRY SCHOOL SO. WE'RE NOT READY TO DO ANYTHING WITH THE DRY SCHOOL TODAY WE ARE IN ACTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE WOULD USE US AS AN ACCELERATOR. TRULY. TO KNOCK ON THE BACK ON SENATOR. WELL WILL THANK VERY MUCH. OF THIS GOING ALL. SOUND VERY ON. HOPEFUL IN OF THE ISSUES OUT SO CERTAINLY PLAYED OUTSIDE THE DISTRICT LEVEL SO A LOT MY DOUBTS TOO YOU'LL AND I'M GONNA WIN AYE CANDLES AND I'M BACK IN PERSON THERE ARE YOU WILL HAVE MY SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH- CENTER MONEY LET ME START WITH YOU. THANK YOU ANA. MADAM CHAIR IN. MISTER GORE AND I ALSO WANT TO OFFER MY CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT AND THANK YOU FOR STEPPING UP TO BRING OVERSIGHT AND REFORM TO THE DMV AND NOW DEALING WITH THIS AMIDST THE COVERT NINETEEN I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE OVER NINE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. WORKING UNDER YOUR SUPERVISION AT THE DMV COULD YOU SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE- AND THE PUBLIC THE STEPS YOU'RE TAKING TO PROTECT EMPLOYEES TO PROTECT. ESTA MURDERS AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME RE OPENING OF OFFICES WHAT IS THE SCHEDULE- FOR THE RE OPENINGS- CONSISTENT WITH THE PROTECTIONS NECESSARY FOR CODE NINETEEN THANK YOU. GREAT THANK SENATOR SO FOUR OUT THE PROTECTIONS AND WE'RE TAKING THE STANDARD PP PROTECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR EMPLOYEES OUT FACEMASK WE'VE ALSO IN SOME PLACES ARE NOT ALL PLACE THANK YOU WE GIVEN THEM SHE LOOKED OLDER OPTIONAL FOR THEM TO WEAR CORSET WORK GLOVES. AND THERE'S CLEANING MATERIALS AT THOSE IT AS YOU KNOW WITH MANY INDUSTRIES WERE IN SHORT SUPPLY SO ACTED TAKE US AWHILE TO GET THOSE IN PLACE BUT NOW THEY'VE BEEN SUPPLIED TO OUR SITES AS THE OPEN WE MAKE SURE OF COURSE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN IS SOLID SO WE WON'T RUN OUT. SO THAT'S THE FIRST THING WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE EMPLOYEES STAY STATE WE'VE ALSO TAKEN CHAIRS OUT OF THE LOBBY WE COULD HAND WASHING STATIONS IN MANY OF OUR DMV'S OUR CUSTOMERS CAN'T. GATHER CLOSER THAN THEY SHOULD AND THEY ALSO HAVE A CHANCE OF YOU KNOW ONE OF THE MAJOR PROTECTIONS FOR WASHING YOUR HANDS. AND LASTLY WE ASK OUR OUR CUSTOMERS ACTUALLY REQUIRE CUSTOMERS TO WEAR SOME SORT OF FACIAL COVERAGE REDUCING THE REST OFFER THEM FOR TRANSMITTING TO OTHER PEOPLE IN THE LOBBY BUT ALSO TO OUR EMPLOYEES AND LIKE WAYS WITH OUR OUR EMPLOYEES WEARING A MASK. IT REDUCES THE RISK OVER ALSO I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH GENERAL SORT OF PP WE ALSO OF COURSE ARE DOING SOME CONTRACTS WHICH IS RECOMMENDED BY CALLIE CHAR AND- AND SO WE ASK OUR EMPLOYEES BEGINNING EVERY DAY ABOUT IT DO THEY HAVE A FEVER. YOU HAVE BEEN AROUND ANYBODY WITH THE ROUTE THEY TRAVEL TO COUNTRIES WHERE. YEAH THIS STOP THE SYMPTOMS ARE COMING NINETEEN NINETY MORE PREVALENT IT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY YEAH REDUCING RISK BY MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE SUFFERING COURT WHERE THEY CAN'T. THAT HAS BEEN I THINK FAIRLY SUCCESSFUL OF COURSE WE'VE BEEN IMPACTED BY CO IN NINETEEN- WITHOUT AYE FORTY ONE CASES TO DATE AND BUT ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RETURN TO WORK- SITES HAVE BEEN CLEANED WE HAVE AN ACCENT WE FOLLOW LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES SO. IF IT HAPPENS IN ORANGE COUNTY EVER HAPPENS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY WE MAKE SURE WE LINK UP WITHOUT THOSE HEALTH AUTHORITIES WE FOLLOW THEIR PROTOCOLS TO. SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE DONE I THINK TO PROTECT A THE STAFF ON ON NOW. I'M CO IN EIGHTEEN UNDER THE QUESTION WITH THE FACT THAT WE DON'T NEED WE ARE WE'RE IN THE. SECOND PHASE WE CAN HAVE A OPENING A SERIES OF ALL. EVERY COP OF WEEKS. SO OUR FIRST TRYING BOXES WILL TWENTY. SIX RETAIL. AND OF OUR BUSINESS DEALER IN FINANCE. TO AND SO ON. WE OPENED ANOTHER. SO ABOUT A AGO THEN. CIVIL UNREST HAPPENED SO WE ACTUALLY HAD A- RAMP THOSE DOWN A LITTLE BIT BUT WE JUST. ARE STARTING I REOPEN IT AGAIN TODAY AT FULL STRENGTH OF THOSE FIRST TWO. WAVES SAVE FOR- ONES THAT ARE IN- UNSETTLED AREAS OF TO SAY THAT. OUR NEXT WAY WILL OPEN WE BELIEVE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS. AND WHEN WE DO THAT THAT WILL ALSO COME WITH. A SLOW RAMP UP OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO ON A DRIVE TO SO WE EXPECT TO BE BY THE END OF JUNE. TO BE FULLY BACK IN BUSINESS. RUNNING AND HOW WHAT IS NOW THE NEW NORMAL. THANK YOU AND IF I COULD JUST GO BACK TO THE CODE NINETEEN. YOU MENTIONED FORTY ONE CASES. WHAT IS THE PROTOCOL IF A- AN EMPLOYEE. REPORTS TO BE SYMPTOMATIC OR TESTS POSITIVE IN A COVERT NINETEEN. TEST WHAT. WHAT STEPS ARE TAKEN- TO PROTECT EMPLOYEES WHO MAY HAVE HAD CONTACT WITH EMPLOYEE- AND OR WITH. PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES. YEAH AND SO ON IN THAT CASE IN ACTUALLY IN EVERY CASE WE CONTACT THE LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES SHOES AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. IN THE END HE'S COUNTY FORTY HAS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PROTOCOL WE FOLLOW THAT PROTOCOL SO THEY MENTIONED CASES IN OUR COUNTY WE FOLLOW THE ORANGE COUNTY HEALTH OFFICIALS CASES IN RIVERSIDE AND FOLLOW THEIR- THEIR PROTOCOL AND THAT INVOLVES EVERYTHING FROM. NOTIFYING PEOPLE WITH COURSE WERE WERE ALSO WORRIED ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT IF YOU WILL THE HIPAA REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE SAME SOMETHING SPECIFIC ABOUTAN INDIVIDUAL WE DO NOTIFY EMPLOYEES WE FOLLOW THE PROTOCOL WHETHER THAT IS TO YOU YOUR CLEAN IN REAL MINOR CLEAN WAIT AND REOPENED WHAT WHATEVER THE PROTOCOL IS BY. BY AREA WE FOLLOW THOSE TO THE LETTER. CASE IT INVOLVES. TOM I CALLS BALLS CLEANING THE FIVE THERE'S A PROTOCOL FOR CLEAN THIS SITE PROTOCOL IT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED AND THEN IF THEY IF THE HEALTH AUTHORITIES BELIEVE IT'S PRUDENT WE BRING BRING PEOPLE BACK THE NEXT DAY OR THE DAY AFTER THAT WHATEVER THE WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET IT DONE IN CASE YOU HAVE ANY CASES RIGHT WE HAVE SOMEBODY WHO HASN'T BEEN A WORK IN A AND A COUPLE OF WEEKS BUT EVERY SELF REPORTED- THE OTHER THEY'VE THEY'VE HAD THE SYMPTOMS ARE SO OF THE FAMILIES SOMETIMES. AND AGAIN WE FOLLOW LOCAL AUTHORITIES BUT I WILLBUY MY RECALL REQUIRE A DIFFERENT APPROACH BUT AGAIN IT COULD FALL IN THE LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES WHATEVER THE REGULATIONS ARE THAT'S WHAT WE WANT THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWER ON THAT IN THE INTERESTED IN TIME I'LL JUST CLOSE WITH THE QUESTION- WE DID HAVE AN-EXTENSIVE CONVERSATION YESTERDAY ABOUT THE- REAL ID AND IN THOSE DEADLINES BEING PUSHED BACK THAT GIVES THEM BEING CALIFORNIANS A LITTLE MORE TIME- BUT- FOR MY FINAL QUESTION. OF MISTER. GORDON I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT. NOT ONLY YOUR- BUT WHAT YOU ARE DOING TO IMPLEMENT- A CHANGE OF CULTURE IN TERMS OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. YOU WE HEAR OF STORIES OF- THERE IS REPORT A FEW YEARS AGO OF AN EMPLOYEE WHO IS. SLEEPING ON THE JOB WE'VE HEARD OTHERS OF- KIND OF A JOKE ABOUT DMV EMPLOYEES NOT BEING. THAT PLATE TO CUSTOMERS OR- HOW DO YOU CHANGE THAT CULTURE WITH NINE OVER NINE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES TO CREATE. TO MAKE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS CUSTOMERS. NUMBER ONE IN THE MISSION OF THE DAM. EXCELLENT QUESTION THANK YOU SENATOR YOUR CULTURE IS THE MOST CHALLENGING THING THAT WE TRY TO OVERCOME EVERY SINGLE DAY THE GOOD NEWS IS I HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT A FIFTY ONE DIFFERENT FIELD OFFICES AND I FOUND A VERY ENERGIZED WORKFORCE. AND I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE WHAT YOU READ ABOUT IN THE PRESS WAS THAT THERE WERE PROBLEMS VERY MUCH SENATOR LIKE YOU JUST MENTIONED. BUT I FOUND PEOPLE THAT- ARE INSPIRED BY OUR VISION THEY ARE INSPIRED TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS THEY ARE OPEN TO NEW WAYS OF DOING THINGS. AND WHEN I GOT THEM AND I SHARE THE IDEAS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING AND HOW WE'RE DOING IT I THINK THEY'RE VERY EXCITED NEED TO BE ABLE TO RAPIDLY IMPLEMENT THANKS TO CALL THE NINETEEN MANY OF THESE THINGS IS VIRTUAL FIELD OFFICE THAT WE ESSENTIALLY START UP OVERNIGHT. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT AND OPERATE THAT REALLY AND I AND I I'M A RADICAL CHANGE IN JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS I REALLY DISPELS IN MY MIND THE MISSILES WELL THE STATE EMPLOYEE NOT WILLING TO DO THINGS AND- THE GAS BECAUSE YOU SAID. I'M NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE OF THAT ABOUT THE WHAT I HAVE SEEN IS A VERY AND INSPIRE TEAM BUT IT SEEMS THAT NEEDS TO BE LIKE NOW YOUR QUESTION CULTURE. CULTURE IS THE MOST CHALLENGING THING WE HAVE SO THAT'S GOING TO START WITH ME IT'S GOING TO START WITH MY LEADERSHIP TEAM AND WE NEED TO MODEL THE RIGHT. CULTURE REALLY IS DO WHAT ARE THOSE NORMS AND WHAT IT WHEN THEY ALWAYS SAY THE CULTURE IS REALLY WHAT YOU DO WHEN NOBODY ELSE IS LOOKING. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ON THE RIGHT. NOBODY ELSE IS LOOKING AND THAT MEANS WE- RESPECT WHEN YOU RESPOND WITHIN SERIOUSLY AND AS I MENTIONED IT WHEN WE SPOKE- JUST YESTERDAY I GAVE SEVERAL CUSTOMERS I'M SINGLE DO I LOOK ANOTHER SCREEN AND A COUPLE TO CUSTOMERS AND ENGAGE WITH YOM THEY'RE- RAISING ISSUES BUT IT'S GREAT FOR ME TO HAVE VISIBILITY BUT IT'S ALSO GREAT FOR ME TO. WORK WITH MY STAFF AND WORK WITH PEOPLE ON ON LINE TO SAY THAT IT'S OKAY TO REACH OUT TO CUSTOMERS LOCATED TO DO THINGS IN NEW WAYS AND TAKE FEEDBACK AND HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE. AND LASTLY I THINK WE NEED MEASURES AND I THINK WE SPOKE ABOUT THIS YESTERDAY WE'RE DOING SOME BUSINESS PROCESS RE ENGINEERING THESE BIASED REMAPPING WITH ALL THESE THINGS TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW IS. THE PROCESS WORKING. AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE WANT TO REDO. CYCLE TIMES. ALL THE DO. BUT THAT HASN'T IN. THAT IS THE COST FOR. YOU KNOW HOW ANY LONGER TO PROCESS WE MAKE. RIDGE TO UNNECESSARILY. BECAUSE WE YOU ARE TO. IS OVER THE- AND IT REALLY CHEAP SIMPLE. EVERYTHING WE DO THE SIMPLE. EVERY WE DO THAT TO MEASURE AND CREW OUR- STAGE NOT ONLY. THE STATE TIME AND TERMS OF THE RESOURCE. CAST COMPLETED TASK BUT ALSO TASTE CUSTOMER. SO THEY CAN PUT THAT. VALUE TO WORK I CAN TAKE OF. A CHILD TAKE CARE OF A GRANT. YOU CAN GO TO WORK THEY DON'T HAVE TO SPEND SO MUCH TIME IN THE DMV SO. IT'S ALL OF THOSE THINGS OVER TIME THAT IF WE CONTINUE TO MODEL THE RIGHT BEHAVIOR MEASURE THE RIGHT THINGS. REINFORCER I THINK THAT WE WILL. SEE THE SEA CHANGE OF CULTURE AND I HOPE YOU'LL SEE IT. IN HOW CUSTOMERS PERCEIVE US TODAY ARAB THESE PRETTY THIS TOMORROW. AND I'M DOING EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES SENATOR. WELL THANK YOU DIRECTOR GORDON REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR- ENTHUSIASM I LIKE THAT YOU'RE VIEWING THIS IS THE CAPSTONE OF YOUR PROFESSIONAL CAREER. IN THE YOU BRING THAT. SKILL SET AND ENTHUSIASM TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THANK YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR MONNING LET ME TURN TO OUR VICE CHAIRMAN SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM- PRO TEN- CONGRATULATIONS- MR GARDEN- LIKE. ON YOUR POINT AND I AM I PLAN TO VOTE FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION TODAY. ACTUALLY THE QUESTIONING FOR CENTER BASIS OR MINING WAS QUITE EXTENSIVE AND FRANKLY- COVERED ALL THE AREAS- THAT I AM INTERESTED IN. ARE YOU DID SAY ONE THING THOUGH IT'S KIND OF A- INTRIGUING TO ME AND IT'S KIND OF A SIDE BAR BUT- MANY MY PARENTS WANT THEIR KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL IN THE FALL AND COURSERS CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. AND I'VE I'VE TOURED MANY SCHOOLS AND I THINK THERE'S ENACT INADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE AS RELATES TO BATHROOMS IN BEING ABLE TO WATCH HER HANDS AND WHAT HAVE YOU AND YOU MENTIONED ABOUT HAND WASHING STATION SO I JUST CURIOUS IF YOU CAN WALK US THROUGH THAT BECAUSE THIS MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE- TO OUR SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. SURE SURE WE HAVE A VERY CREATIVE TEAM. BACK TO SENATOR MONIES COMMENT- DISPELLING THE MYTHS WE HAVE A VERY CREATIVE TEAM IN OUR IN OUR FIELD- THEY HAVE- THEY SAID OKAY WE'RE GONNA NEED HANNAH. WE NEED PEOPLE TO WASH YOUR HANDS EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE. YOUR BATHROOM FACILITIES THAT ARE. ARE THE ENVY IS USUALLY NOT AND IS NOT INTENDED FOR COMPLETE HAND WASHING EVERYBODY'S COMING THROUGH. SO CREATED AS A ARE THEY WENT OFF THEY RENTED FROM THESE RENTAL COMPANIES THESE PORTABLE HAND WATCHES AGENCY A CONSTRUCTION SITE. I THINK THEY SAW SOMEBODY AT A SUPERMARKET HEY THERE'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA-SO. I THINK YOU KNOW THEY WERE THEY FELT IN ENABLE THEY FOUND EMPOWER TO GO OFF AND DO THAT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO SO THEY'VE NOW PUT THOSE OUT AT. OUR DMV'S AND YOU'LL SEE THEM AGAIN LOBBYIST HIM OUT IN THE- IN THE PARKING LOTS JUST SO CUSTOMERS CAN. YOU KNOW YEP FURTHER INSULATE THEMSELVES OF THE CROP SO GETTING VERY CREATIVE EIGHT EIGHT THEY CALLED A COUPLE OF COMPANIES. AND HEY THEN THEY TOOK ACTION BECAUSE THEY KNEW EVEN IF IT WAS A TEN PERCENT. REDUCTION IN THE RISK. YEAH THEY TOOK THE ACTION AND I KEPT THEIR EMPLOYEES ARE EMPLOYEES. SAY FOR ANY KEPT THE PUBLIC PAPERS WELL. GREAT JUST I JUST WANT AGAIN WOULD JUST ONE FINAL COMMENT. I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT YOUR COMMITMENT. TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. I HATE TO BE A HOMER BUT IN MY HOME TOWN CENTER CREATED WHICH IS NOW THE THIRD LARGEST CITY IN LA COUNTY. ARE DMV'S BEEN AT THE SAME LOCATION LIKE. HI FORTY FIVE YEARS ANYWAY AS LONG AS I'VE LIVED THERE. HORRIBLE INGRESS AND EGRESS. AND WAY TOO SMALL FOR A COMMUNITY OF THAT SIZE SO. ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO ACCESS. SERVICES IN ALL PLATFORMS I THINK I THINK IT'S A GOOD THING BECAUSE WITH HIS BUDGET. CRISIS OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GONNA GET NEW DMV FACILITY ANYTIME SOON ALTHOUGH WE'VE MY COMMUNITY CERTAINLY DESERVES THAT. SO WITH THAT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOUR CONFIRMATION TODAY.

I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY FAMILY. MEMBERS WHO ARE WATCHING THIS DURING THE MOBLIE. ESPECIALLY MY WIFE JENNIFER AND MY SON PARKER. WITHOUT HIS LOVE AND SUPPORT MY CHEAPENS BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE. PUBLIC EDUCATION HAS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE AND CAREER. WHILE AN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENT AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY THIRTY YEARS AGO. I WORK IN A LOTTERY FUNDED MENTORSHIP PROGRAM AT NEWARK MEMORIAL HIGH SCHOOL IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IN THAT JOB I EXPLAIN DIFFERENT PATHWAYS TO HIGHER EDUCATION TO UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS. AND THAT WORK HAS INSPIRED MY CAREER EVER SENSE. MY GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC POLICY EXPERIENCE SPANS OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND INCLUDES WORK ON EDUCATION POLICY AND GOVERNMENT GAMING ISSUES FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WITH NATIVE AMERICANS SOVEREIGN TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. MY CAREER HAS INCLUDED WORK IN LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS POLICY DEVELOPMENT AND PRACTICE. ON SUBJECTS INCLUDING K. TWELVE EDUCATION POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. INDIAN AFFAIRS AND GOVERNMENT GAMING. THE UNIQUE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES I GAME THROUGH MY EDUCATION POLICY BACKGROUND AND GOVERNOR GOVERNMENT GAINING EXPERIENCE PROVIDING ME WITH A STRONG SENSE OF THE LOTTERY'S MISSION AS WELL AS INSIGHT INTO THE DYNAMICS OF THE GAMING INDUSTRY. THE CALIFORNIA LOTTERY HAS A UNIQUE ROLE IN STATE GOVERNMENT. ALL PROFITS FROM THE SALE LOTTERY TICKETS SUPPORT THE FULL RANGE OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. FROM ELEMENTARY TO UNIVERSITY. IN ADDITION ON SPENT AND MINISTRY OF FUNDS AND UNCLAIMED PRIZES EACH YEAR ARE ALSO SENT TO PUBLIC EDUCATION. LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES SUCH A SCHOOL DISTRICT THE SITE WHERE AND HOW THE LOTTERY MONIES SPENT. IN OUR MOST RECENT FULLY AUDITED FISCAL YEAR LOTTERY GENERATED MORE THAN ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION MORE THAN EVER BEFORE. THESE FUNDS TOTALING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR MANY LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR KEY STUDENT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. SINCE ITS INCEPTION OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO THE LOTTERY HAS PRINCIPALLY FOCUSED ON ESTABLISHING ITSELF AND FULFILLING ITS MISSION BY RAPIDLY GROWING SALES. THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN TREMENDOUSLY SUCCESSFUL IN THIS REGARD AS ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO EDUCATION OVER THE LAST NINE YEARS HAVE INCREASED FROM ONE BILLION TO ONE POINTEIGHT. A RECORD HIGH. THIS IS THE RESULT OF DEDICATED WORK FOR MORE OVER EIGHT HUNDRED STATE EMPLOYEES. MANY OF WHOM HAVE WORKED FOR THE LOTTERY FOR A DECADE OR MORE. TODAY THE CALIFORNIA LOTTERY IS A KEY INFLECTION POINT IN ITS HISTORY. I'LL JUST HAVE BEEN POSED BY NEW TECHNOLOGY. CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND CRISES SUCH AS THE COVERT NINETEEN AND THEN. TO MEET OUR MANDATE TO MAXIMIZE THE FUNDING WE GENERATE FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION OUR OPERATIONS MUST WORK BETTER AND SMARTER. WE MUST DIRECT MORE ATTENTION AND RESOURCES TO ESTABLISHING A MORE MATURE AND STABLE ORGANIZATION. WITH BETTER PROCEDURES CONTROLS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. TO ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS WE ARE SYSTEMATICALLY WORKING TO IMPROVE LOTTERY OPERATIONS STARTING FIRST WITH MANAGING. BY FAILING KEY ROLES OPENING LINES OF COMMUNICATION AND ENCOURAGING MORE T. MORE. WELL WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN THE LAST YEAR THERE IS MUCH WORK STILL TO BE DONE. AND WE WILL FIX PROBLEMS WHEN WE FIND. FINALLY I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS RAISED IN RECENT AUDITS. PLEASE KNOW THAT WE ARE ADDRESSING THESE FINDINGS ADMINISTRATIVELY. AND I'VE ALREADY BEGUN TO IMPLEMENT IMPORTANT CHANGES THAT WILL HELP ADDRESS THE INTERNAL CONTROL GAPS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM WILL REVIEW AND STRENGTHEN ALL DEPARTMENT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FROM TOP TO BOTTOM TO ENSURE THEIR FALL IN PRACTICE. THIS WILL IMPROVE EFFICIENCIES AND HELP US BETTER CALL OUR MISSION. IN DOING SO HE WILL REBUILD THE PUBLIC'S TRUST AND RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN OUR DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU AAIN FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO COME BEFORE YOU TODAY. I APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH DIRECTOR JOHNSON LET ME ARE START WITH ACTUALLY SENATOR BTES REMOTELY AND THEN I'LL GO TO SENATOR ROTH. THANK YOU- SENATOR ATKINS AND ALL CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENTS ON MISTER JOHNSON- I KNOW WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY THE FOR THE- KOBE IS SHUT DOWN. I TO MEET IN MY OFFICE AND AT THAT TIME I THINK YOU WERE VERY IMPRESSIVE AND SHARING THAT YOU WERE THERE TO REFORM AND YOU HAD PLANNED TO DO THAT ARE A CERTAIN NEED THE YOUNG MONEY THE THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS OWED TO THE SCHOOL. WHAT'S HOT HIGH ON THE LIST OF THINGS THAT NEEDED TO BE LOOKED AT AND I INVESTIGATED IN MORE DETAIL. SO I AM STILL THERE WITHOUT ISSUE ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT I KNOW THAT MY COLLEAGUES ON BOTH WHO WILL BE SPEAKING TO YOU ON THE VERY FOLLOWING YOU WILL PROBABLY TALK ABOUT THAT ALSO BUT I THINK UP IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO KNOW THAT THAT. AT THE MOMENT WITH THE HUGE DEFICIT WE HAVE IN OUR BUDGET THING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO OUR SCHOOLS OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT CERTAINLY IS MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY TO SEE THAT YOU ARE ADDRESSING MATTER NOW AFTER YEARS SOME SOLUTION- IF THE PAIN BACK ON TAKES LONGER DANCE. IS A SHORTER TERM WE WOULD HOPE FOR THAT CERTAINLY UNDERSTANDABLE BUT I THINK WE ALL NEED TO KNOW TIMELINE ON NOW. AND OUT TO ALL OF THE FORCES THAT ARE THERE ARE WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY ON THAT ISSUE- I THINK YOU'VE COME TO THE AGENCY WITH A GREAT BACKGROUND I THINK WE DISCUSSED THAT. AND JOHN WHEN YOU'RE THE REFORM AGENT A LOT IS ON YOUR SHOULDERS WE HAVE YOUR STAND THAT THAT I THINK YOU'RE UP TO THE CHALLENGE BACK I GO AGAIN BOTTOM LINE COMMON DENOMINATOR IS GOING TO BE THAT ONE DAY SHE GOT UP. CERTAINLY FORMAL STARTING A LOT OF YOU KNOW OUR CONSTITUENTS OUR PARENTS AND OUR CHILDREN OUT THERE SO WE OWE THANK YOU FOR YOUR COULD NOT MATCH. AND WISH YOU WELL AND NINE BE OOKING FORWARD TO SEEING YOU WHEN I CAN ACTUALLY BOTH CHARLIE IN PERSON. ON THE FLOOR THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU VERY FOR YOUR- I RE PRE. I ENJOY CHANCE WE MILLION PER IF YOU AGO. SINCE SINCE SINCE. OR THIRTY YEARS AGO. CALIFORNIA LOTTERY HAS ALWAYS FOLLOW THE LOTTERY ACTS OVER ARCHING MISSION. MAXIMIZE FUNDING FOR EDUCATION. OVER THE LAST NINE FISCAL YEAR'S LOTTERY HAS GROWN ITS CONTRIBUTION TO PUBLIC EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. FROM ONE BILLION TO ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE LOTTERY ACT MANDATES THAT ALL PROFITS. ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS AND UNCLAIMED PRIZES BE TRANSFERRED TO EDUCATION EVERY YEAR. THERE ARE NO WHAT LEFTOVER FUNDS IN ANY YEAR. IN FISCAL YEAR THE YEAR THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT FOCUSED ON. THE LOTTERY PROVIDED ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS TO EDUCATION. REQUIRING A LOTTERY TO ONLY FOLLOW MANDATE OF STRICT PROPORTIONALITY BETWEEN SALES REVENUES AND EDUCATION CONTRIBUTIONS THAT YEAR. WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN APPROXIMATELY THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS LESS IN FUNDING FOR EDUCATION. THIS IS BECAUSE IN ORDER TO FOLLOW THE STRICT PROPORTIONALITY MANDATE THE LOTTERY WOULD HAVE HAD TO STOP SELLING CERTAIN POPULAR AIDS AND OVERALL SALES REVENUES WOULD THEN HAVE FALLEN BY MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THANK THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION AND THOROUGHLY GOING FORWARD WILL- WE'LL GET THINGS WORKED OUT FOR A CERTAINLY THE LOTTERY AND AGAIN OUR EDUCATION ISSUES. THANK-YOU. VERY MUCH THANK YOU SENATOR BATES LET ME TURN TO US SENATOR ROTH. APPROACH HIM IS TO DIRECTOR CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU SIR LET ME SAY AT THE OUTSET THAT I FULLY INTEND TO SUPPORT YOUR CONFIRMATION BUT I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IN MY- OTHER JOB OF PURELY SO LAST YEAR SO I OR TWO I'VE BEEN. FOCUSED ON EDUCATION FUNDING AND SO I PAYED ATTENTION WHEN THIS- STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT CAME OUT IN FEBRUARY OR MARCH OF THIS YEAR. AND OBVIOUSLY IT BECAUSE SOME COMMOTION AMONG THE- AND EDUCATION COMMUNITY WITH RESPECT TO FUNDING AND- I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO THE THIRTY SIX MILLION OR WHATEVER IT IS TODAY BECAUSE THE- IT SEEMS TO BE SOME CONFLICT IN BETTER THAN THE REPORT OVER. NET REVENUE AND HAS THAT HAVE THAT CAL IS CALCULATED IN THE DEFINITION SET FORTH IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION. IN THIS OF THAT POSTERS WAS THIS RATHER- INTERESTING CONVERSATION ABOUT PROPORTIONALITY IN WHEN I READ IT I NOTED YOU KNOW PORTION OF TO WHAT YOU KNOW PROPORTIONALITY REALLY DOESN'T HAVE. MEETING UNLESS YOU TALK TO ME ABOUT AS A ONE FOR ONE OR ONE FOR TWO OR ONE FOR THREE AND- THEN WE UNDERSTAND WHAT PROPORTION IT REALLY MEANS BILL WE DON'T KNOW THAT. REALLY BASED ON. I GUESS THE LANGUAGE OF THE LOTTERY ACT BUT I DO WANT TO FOCUS ON THE TWO THOUSAND TEN AMENDMENTS AND- PERFORMANCE SINCE THEN AND WHEN I READ THE REPORT I NOTED THAT SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN ACCORDING TO REPORT. AND THOSE AMENDMENTS THE LOTTERY. TOTAL REVENUE INCREASED BY A HUNT ONE HUNDRED AND 15% AND THE FUNDING PROVIDED TO EDUCATION INCREASED BY. 66% NOW I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MEASURE THAT I WOULD THINK THAT IF THE TOTAL REVENUE INCREASED BY ONE HUNDRED AND 15% AS A PERCENTAGE THAT THE FUNDING PROVIDED TO EDUCATION WOULD ROUGHLY INCREASED BY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND 15% BUT SOME ADJUSTMENT. NECESSARY IF THE PRIZE POT INCREASED SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS TRULY A TWO PARTER. IS THAT A GOOD THING ONE HUNDRED AND 15% AND 66% AND HOW TO Y. SS THAT PERFORMANCE IN TERMS OF THE SPREAD. BETWEEN TOTAL REVENUE AND EDUCATION FUNDING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. YOU KNOW I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH THEIR STAFF TALKING ABOUT THESE DIFFERENT CALCULATIONS AND- YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S- COMPLICATED. AND WE GOT TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME- DIGGING INTO THE NUMBERS AND EXPLAINED IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND WE SPENT SIX MONTHS LAST YEAR TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE DETAILS TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY CUT THROUGH ME WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS IS HOW I KEY. VARIABLE THE CALCULATION HAS NOT BEEN BROUGHT OUT IN THE PUBLIC DISCUSSION. IN PRESS ACCOUNTS OR IN VARIOUS REPORTS. ACOSTA PRICE IS EIGHT. WATERY SALES ARE DONE IN A VOLUNTARY FASHION. IF WE WERE TO MAKE PEOPLE BUY LOTTERY TICKETS WE CALL IT TAX SO THE WAY THAT THE LOTTERY MOTIVATES SALES IS BY OFFERING MORE AND BETTER PRICES TEN YEARS AGO THE BILL YOU REFERENCED AB ONE FORTY TO. ALLOW MORE PRICE FLEXIBILITY ALLOWING LOTTERY THE LOTTERY COMMISSION TO DETERMINE WAYS TO REALLY CHANGE THE POT THE PRIZE PAYOUT STRUCTURE SO THAT IT WOULD BE MORE ATTRACTIVE TO PLAYERS TO PLAY CERTAIN GAMES NOW WHY IS THAT WITH JACKPOT GAMES YOU HAVE A TYPICAL PAY OUT OF ABOUT 50% I'M TALKING ABOUT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THE- THE- THE VERY SHOCKED JACKPOT GAMES LIKE MEGA MILLIONS OR POWERBALL OR SUPERLOTTO PLUS. ALL OUR SCRATCHERS GAMES WHERE THE LOTTERY DERIVE 70% OF ITS REVENUE WE ACTUALLY HAVE A HIGHER PRICE PALE. KNOWN PLAIN ENGLISH WHAT THAT MEANS IS WE MAKE LESS MONEY ON. BUT THEY'RE VERY POPULAR AND THAT'S WHY SCRATCHERS GAMES THE INSTANT TICKET GAMES ACTUALLY GENERATE. THE MAJORITY OF THE LOTTERY SALES. WITH THE PRICE FLEXIBILITY GRANTED TEN YEARS AGO IN AB ONE FORTY TWO WHAT THE LOTTERY WAS ABLE TO DO IS INTRODUCE EVEN HIGHER PRICE POINT GAMES. GAMES AT THE SCRATCHERS- IN THIS WRITER'S CATEGORY THAT RENT TWENTY DOLLARS. AND SO I'M GOING TO ASK WILL WHY WOULD SOMEONE BY THAT BUT THE THING IS A LOT OF OUR CORE PLAYERS LOVE THOSE GAMES BECAUSE THEY COME IN VARIOUS STYLES AND BERRIES PLAY WHAT. FOR AND SO WE FOUND THAT WHEN WE INTRODUCED THOSE GAMES WE WERE ABLE TO GENERATE EVEN MORE SALES WITH THOSE CATEGORIES AND BECAUSE THE PRICE PALE RANGES FROM 50% TO AS HIGH AS 60% SOME CASES EVEN MORE YOU END UP HAVING A BLENDED RATE. WHERE ULTIMATELY UP TO SPEND MORE MONEY IN PRICES TO GENERATE HIGHER SALES. NOW AS I EXPLAINED EARLIER AND AS EVERYBODY KNOWS THE NET PROFITS WE TAKE THOSE SALES MINUS THE COST OF THE PRICES. MINUS ACOSTA ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES UNCLAIMED PRIZES AND- OTHER- ARE FEES TO OPERATE THE GAMING SYSTEM THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE LEFT NONPROFIT GHOST EDUCATION. SO I GUESS SHORTER ANSWERS LIKE THIS. THE LOTTERY OF THE LAST DECADE SEND THE SPEND MORE MONEY AND PRIZES GENERATE HIGHER SALES. OUR THIS. SALES WERE FLAT BY ABOUT THREE OR FOUR YEARS THERE WAS NO BROKE. AND THE LOTTERIES MISSION AS SET FORTH IN THE LOTTERY ACT ABOUT THIRTY FIVE YEARS AGO WAS TO MAXIMIZE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR EDUCATION TO DO EVERYTHING IT COULD. TO RAISE MORE MONEY FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION SO WITH FLAT SALES THERE HAD TO BE A CHANGE IN THE WAY THE LOTTERY DID THINGS TO GENERATE MORE SALES. AND AS I EXPLAINED THE LOTTERY IF THIS AFTER THE LEGISLATURE GRAND THAT CHANGE LAW BY OFFERING MORE AND BETTER PRICES IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES WHICH ARE MORE ATTRACTIVE SOME PLAYERS AND THUS. GENERATING HIGHER SALES AND AS I EXPLAINED OF THE LAST NINE YEARS WE'VE INCREASED THE CONTRIBUTION RESULTING FROM THE SALES TO EDUCATION. FROM ONE MILLION TO ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. SO I THINK ULTIMATELY THE METRIC SHOULD BE. HOW IS THE CONTRIBUTION EDUCATION GROWN OVER TIME. IT WAS FLAG BEFORE THE CHANGED YEARS AGO NOW IT'S INCREASING ON A REGULAR RATE. I DO TO RECENT EVENTS REPUBLICAN HAS IT BEEN WHICH USUALLY A BIT OF A CHANGE IN THAT HOWEVER OUR THREE YEAR STRATEGIC PLAN WHICH STILL HAS TO BE APPROVED BY THE COMMISSION. HAS A GOAL OF REACHING THE LEVEL OF CONTRIBUTION TO PUBLIC. EDUCATION OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS. SO WE'RE ALWAYS ON A- TO GENERATE MONEY FOR SCHOOLS AND LOOKING FOR MORE AND BETTER WAYS TO DO THAT. SO JUST GET TO GET BACK TO MY FIRST QUESTION YOU ANSWERED IT UP. THE **** ACCOUNTS FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND 5015% AND SIXTY SIX PERCENT. IS THE INCREASE IN THE PIES IN THE PRIZE POT. THE AMOUNT OF PRIZE MONEY THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED- THROUGH THE LOTTERY CORRECT. THAT'S RIGHT WE SAT HIGHER PAYOUTS ON SOME GAMES AND THAT IS BASICALLY DRIVEN SALES. NOW IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE'S A REQUIREMENT IN THE LOTTERY ACT THAT NOT LESS THAN EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT. OF THE TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUE FROM LOTTERY SALES GO BACK TO THE PUBLIC IN THE FORM OF PRIZES IN FUNDING. FOR EDUCATION IN MY IN MY CORRECT ON THAT. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION CENTER THANK YOU IN FACT. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT I'VE SEEN SINCE I ARRIVED AT THE LOTTERY IS A LOTTERY IS NOT GOING TO GOOD JOB. OF TELLING A STORY BECAUSE ON UNTOLD STORY OF THAT- STATISTIC THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED IS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT GOES OUT IN COMMISSIONS AND BONUSES. YOUR TWENTY TWO THOUSAND RETAILERS ACROSS THE STATE. MANY OF WHICH ARE SMALL BUSINESSES YOU KNOW THERE ARE CHANGE AS WELL BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS IMPORTANT. THESE ARE IMPORTANT ALWAYS TO GO OUT TO THE COMMUNITIES AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MEDICAL SCHOOL FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION. AND THE MONEY THAT GOES OUT TO RETAILERS IN THE FORM OF- OUR PRICES IN COMMISSIONS. THAT'S HOW YOU GET TO THE 87% SO GIVE THAT THEN. ISN'T THE ISSUE HAVE. TO BALANCE THE AMOUNT OF. PRIZE MONEY AND I GUESS COMMISSION AND THE OTHER RELATED ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRIZES. THE AMOUNT OF PRIZE MONEY AGAINST THE NEED TO FIND EDUCATION SO. IF THAT'S THE ISSUE THEN HOW DO YOU SET THE OPTIMUM LEVEL. AND WHAT OPTIMUM LEVEL SHOULD WE EXPECT HERE THAT IS THE OPTIMAL LEVEL OF PRIZE MONEY OFFERED. TO GENERATE THE NECESSARY TOTAL REVENUES THAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE IN THIS LOTTERY SYSTEM IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO FUND. EDUCATION ACROSS THE STATE. WELL YOU KNOW THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT RAISED BY THE STATE AUDITOR- THEY ASK YOU KNOW HEY LOOK YOU GUYS HAVE A PROCESS FOR DETERMINING THE OPTIMAL PRICE PAYOUT BUT THE INFORMATION USING IS ALL. SO SHOULDN'T YOU HAVE MORE UP TO DATE INFORMATION THAT DETERMINES THE OPTIMUM PRICE POINT AND WE AGREE. HE SAID YOU KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO HAVE A AS UP TO DATE- RESEARCH AND INFORMATION THAT WE CAN GET OUR HANDS ON THAT REALLY SHOWS THAT THE NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE CHOSEN IN TERMS OF PRICES AND OTHER RELATED FACTORS ARE THE OPTIMAL POINT IT'S A TRICKY NUMBER. NO WHEN WE HAD TO LEARN CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR BUSINESS PLAN RESEARCH DIVISION OVER THIS IT REMINDED ME A LOT OF MY EXPERIENCE IN GRAD SCHOOL TRYING TO LEARN CALCULUS SO. YOU KNOW IT WAS TRICKY STUFF BUT YOU GOTTA FIND THE OPTIMUM POINT ON THE CURVE FOR YOU YOU'LL THE MOST OUR SALES REP. AND THAT'S THE KIND ON CONSUMER BEHAVIOR ON THE ECONOMY. ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT. SHORT ANSWER IS WE KNOW THIS IS A KEY ISSUE. THE AUDITOR RAISED. IT WE AGREE. AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW TRYING TO FOR OUT. HOW TO GET NEWER AND MORE UP TO DATE STUDY THAT HELPS US DETERMINE THE BEST. OPTIMUM PRICE PALE. WELL THANK YOU AND I THINK THE OTHER CHALLENGE YOU HAVE FRANKLY HAVING TO. BY THE WAY THROUGH THE STATE AUDITOR'S REPORT IN THE OTHER MATERIALS ASSOCIATED WITH A LOTTERY OPERATION IS. FIGURING OUT A WAY TO EXPLAIN THIS RATHER COMPLICATED PROCESS AND THIS RATHER RATHER COMPLICATED SYSTEM THAT YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH. IN ENGLISH SO THAT THOSE OF US WHO WERE NOT TO MATH PEOPLE- CAN UNDERSTAND THAT SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE STUDY THAT YOU ARE GOING TO THE COMMISSION ON THE- TRYING TO ESTABLISH THE OPTIMUM LEVEL. OF PRIZE MONEY VERSUS TOTAL REVENUE IN FUNDING FOR EDUCATION AND- I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO MOVING YOUR CONFIRMATION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME CONGRATULATIONS SIR. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU SENATOR OF MISTRUST CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM- CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT. COUPLE THINGS SO LATE LAST YEAR IT WAS UNVEILED AT THE LOTTERY GIVEAWAY SCRATCHERS AT THE ELLEN SHOW AS A PROMOTIONAL OPPORTUNITY AND SOME STAFF WERE RECIPIENTS OF FREE SCRATCHERS AS WELL SO I GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS RELATED TO THAT WHAT IS THE LOTTERIES METHODOLOGY FOR MEASURING RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS AND TO HOW DO YOU AS A AGENCY GOES WAY PUBLIC PERCEPTION INTO THESE TYPE OF DECISIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I REALLY APPRECIATE IT. STATE LAWS AND LOTTERY REGULATIONS EXPRESSLY ALLOW THE LOTTERY TO EXPAND FUNDS FOR PROMOTIONAL PURPOSES. THIS EFFORT IS MADE TO MAINTAIN AWARENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND MOTIVATE FUTURE SALES FUTURE PURCHASES. THE ONLY SHOW OFFERED A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE CONSUMER AWARENESS OF THE LOTTERY'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO PUBLIC EDUCATION WHILE HELPING TO DRIVE SALES OR SCRATCHES DURING THE HOLIDAYS. THE PROMOTIONAL RUN WITH THE ELLEN SHOW WAS CONTRACTUALLY WAS A CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT THE CALIFORNIA LOTTERY PROVIDED EMOTIONAL SCRATCHERS TICKETS TO THE PROGRAM IN EXCHANGE FOR THE VALUE OF ADVERTISING LOTTERIES BRANDON MISSION. BRINGING IN CHAU INTEGRATION ON THE ELLEN SHOW WAS TWELVE DAYS OF GIVEAWAYS DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON THE CONTRACT ACTUAL AGREEMENT. ALL THE STRUCTURES TO GETS PROVIDED TO THE PROGRAM FOR AN AUDIENCE YOU HAVE TO GIVE AWAY. THERE WERE NO TICKETS MISPLACED OR MISSING FROM THIS PROMOTIONAL BACK. THIS IN CHAU SEGMENT THAT WE WORKED ON WITH THE ELLEN SHOW FEATURED TELEVISION PERSONALITIES ON THE GENEROUS AND JIMMY KIMMEL. ENDORSING THE CALIFORNIA LOTTERY AND HOW WELL THEY SCRATCHERS THIS IS MORE IMPACTFUL THAN TRADITIONAL TELEVISION COMMERCIAL. I PERSONALLY WORK WITH OUR MARKETING TEAM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SHORT VIDEO WE PROVIDED FOR THIS EVENT MEET SPECIFIC MENTION OF EDUCATION AND WHAT THE LOTTERY DOES FOR EDUCATION BECAUSE WE WANT THE PUBLIC TO KNOW. WHAT WE DO REPUBLICAN EDUCATION. RENDON AGGRESSION ON A WIDELY POPULAR SHOW LIKE ALLEN ALSO HELPS REACH NEW PLAYERS THAT MAY NOT OTHERWISE CONSIDER LOTTERY IN GENERAL OR- A LOTTERY TICKET JUST A HOLIDAY GIFT. MOREOVER ELLEN THE GENEROUS IS ALSO A STRONG SUPPORTER OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC EDUCATION. AND SO WE THOUGHT THIS ALIGNED PERFECTLY WITH A LOT OF READING AND OUR MISSION. RIGHT THEY AT THANK YOU FOR THAT- SO I'VE BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS AND IT'S PRETTY RARE THAT WE GET LETTERS IN FROM INDIVIDUALS. AND IN THIS CASE WE'VE RESTORE I THINK WE'VE ALL RECEIVED THREE LETTERS FROM INDIVIDUALS AND IN OPPOSITION TO YOUR APPOINTMENT- FIGHTING THAT THERE'S- POOR CULTURE IN THE AGENCY AND THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT THE PERSON TO. TAKE TO THE AGENCY IN A NEW DIRECTION SO WONDERING A- DO YOU THINK THERE'S A CULTURAL PROBLEM THERE AND IF SO WHAT ARE YOUR STEPS. TO IMPROVE IT. WELL YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING COMMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THE LOTTERY IS BEEN ALMOST A KIND OF A START UP DEPARTMENT I MEAN. THIRTY FIVE YEARS SEEMS LIKE A LONG TIME BUT AS- WE ALL KNOW. EACH OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS IT'S PRETTY YOUNG. AND ITS INITIAL CULTURE WAS KIND OF A BOOTSTRAP YOU KNOW RAPID GROWTH. IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL. BUT A LOT OF THE KINDS OF NORMS AND- PROCESSES AND CULTURAL ASPECTS THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE IN A MATURE STATE AGENCY. OUR WERE UNDERDEVELOPED. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I IMMEDIATELY SAW. AND IF ONE OF THE THINGS WE STARTED IMMEDIATELY WORKING. THESE REFORMS TAKE TIME. BUT YOU KNOW IT IT'S INTERESTING SENATOR BECAUSE WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED YEAR AGO AND WAS BRIEFED ON YOU KNOW VARIOUS MATTERS. I FOUND MYSELF ASKING QUESTIONS LIKE CABLE WHY DO WE DO THAT I'M THINKING WELL I'M I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE I'M NEW HERE RIGHT. AND WHEN PEOPLE ARE RUMORED SAY WHAT WE DON'T KNOW EITHER WE JUST ALWAYS DID IT LIKE THAT I SAID ARE YOU KIDDING. WE NEED TO DOCUMENT WE NEED. TO HAVE CONSISTENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES. I'VE EXPLAINED MY STAFF THE LOTTERY STAFF THAT IS NOT A MATTER OF. IF FOR ALL OF IT IT'S A MATTER OF WHEN. WE MUST BE ABLE TO BE TRANSPARENT AND DEMONSTRATE ACCOUNTABILITY EVERYTHING WE DO WHETHER IT'S AN AUDITOR OR REPORTER. OR A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC FOR A GENTLEMAN LIKE YOURSELF WAS ASKING QUESTIONS AND COMMITTEE. I SAID DOORSTEP IT'S GREAT THAT WE KNOW WHAT TO DO AND IT'S GREAT THAT WE KNOW HOW TO DO IT WELL BUT WE HAVE TO DOCUMENT WE HAVE TO SHOW IT. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE AUDITOR POINTED OUT IS THERE WAS LACKING DOCUMENTATION. AND SO YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS SAY LOOK LET'S BE CONSISTENT AND EXECUTE. AN OBJECTIVE AND LEVEL AND FAIR WAY. NOW THE OTHER PART OF THE QUESTION I THINK CONCERNS. FOLKS WHO WORK AT THE LOTTERY I MADE IT A PRIORITY. THAT WE TAKE CARE OF OUR PEOPLE. THIS IS BEEN A SPECIAL CHALLENGE.OF THE LAST NINETY DAYS. WELL WE'VE HAD CO IN NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND ALSO THESE RECENT- ISSUES WITH CIVIL UNREST. IN FACT I'D QUESTION. EMAIL TO THE ENTIRE STAFF JUST YESTERDAY. BY AN OFFICE TACK. IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR WARRANTY SAYING ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON. AND I WROTE BACK COPPING ALL AND I SAID LOOK. I'M ON A LOT OF OTHER THINGS I SAID WE HAVE TO. PRIORITIZE THE SAFETY OF OUR ORANGE IS JOB ONE. AND THEN WE NEED TO FOCUS ON OUR MISSION. WHICH IS TO MAXIMIZE FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS. NOW AS WE PROGRESS THROUGH THIS WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A SAFE. AND HEALTHY WORKPLACE THAT WE TREAT EACH OTHER WITH PROFESSIONALISM AND RESPECT. AND OTHERS DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION. THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN ENOUGH IN RECENT YEARS. I THINK THERE IS SO MUCH OF A FOCUS ON DRIVING SALES FOR THE SAKE OF SALES BUT NOT ENOUGH AFTER WAS MADE TOWARDS. MAKING SURE THAT MANAGEMENT WAS BEING DONE TO SERVICE THE NEEDS OF THE MPLOYEES AND MAKE SURE EVERYBODY FELT LIKE THEY WERE DOING THE BEST THEY COULD. TREAT EACH OTHER WITH FAIRNESS AND RESPECT. THAT'S WHY WE'RE WE'VE ALREADY ONCE JUST LAST MONTH AN EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT SURVEY. OR SENDING OUT ANONYMOUS SURVEY TO ALL OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN EMPLOYEES ASKING THEM TO BE FRANK ABOUT WHAT WORKS WHAT COULD B DONE BETTER. WE WANT TO USE THAT AS FOUNDATION FOR A MISSION VISION VALUES PROJECT WE'RE GOING TO IDENTIFY YOU CAN CLARIFY THE SHARED VALUES THAT BEST SERVE OUR MISSION. I'VE SEEN AS SOMEWHAT OF A LAUREL ORGANIZATIONS I WORK AND HE WAS MISSING AT THE LOTTERY SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING HERE THE TRYING TO SHIFT THE- CULTURE TO BE A BETTER ONE. GREAT I THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS. AND AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT. THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- I APPRECIATE ALL THE QUESTIONS- AND COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES BECAUSE- CERTAINLY. MINIMUM PROTEST- SENATOR MINING I'M SO SORRY. I JUST ASSUME YOUR ORDERS TO IT IS WITH ME IT IN NO I WILL CONCLUDE WITH ME AND REDO THE RESPECTFUL THING AND LET MY COLLEAGUE GO FIRST SENATOR MINING THANK YOU FOR HOLDING ME ACCOUNTABLE TO MY OWN MY CONSISTENT PROCESS THANK YOU. MADAM PRO TEM IN MR JOHNSON- I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE TIME WE HAD TOGETHER- EARLIER. THIS WEEK- LAST WEEK WHENEVER WE SPOKE AND YOU ANSWERED MANY MY QUESTIONS THEN I DO THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR MY COLLEAGUES IN THE PUBLIC TO HEAR- WHAT YOU ARE DOING- TO PROTECT EMPLOYEES DURING COVERT NINETEEN I ASKED THE SAME QUESTION OF MISTER GORDON- BUT WOULD APPRECIATE. YOUR COMMENTS BOTH ON THE PROTOCOLS YOU'VE PUT IN PLACE AND SPECIFICALLY- THE NUMBER OF REPORTED CASES AMONG EMPLOYEES AND WHERE THOSE HAVE OCCURRED AND WHAT STEPS YOU'RE TAKING TO PROTECT CO WORKERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION YOU KNOW THIS IS ONE OF THE AREAS WHERE IT BECAME REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE MANAGEMENT FORMS WE'VE BEEN PUTTING IN PLACE TO BEAR FRUIT BECAUSE WE HAD TO OPEN UP LINES OF COMMUNICATION. AND ENCOURAGE TEAMWORK AND WHEN THIS ISSUE CAME UPON US THAT BECAME CRITICAL BROUGHT TOGETHER EXECUTIVE TEAM AT ALL HOURS OF THE DAY AND NIGHT AND ON WEEKENDS TO TRY TO. TROUBLESHOOT PROBLEMS ALL. ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE DID AT THE END OF FEBRUARY AS WE MADE SURE THAT. AND SANITIZER CLOSE DISINFECTING WIPES. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WAS MADE AVAILABLE FOR ALL OF OUR FACILITIES THAT WERE NON HEADQUARTERS. AS WE MOVED IN MARCH WE MAKE SURE THAT CUSTODIAL STAFF AT OUR WATER RELOCATIONS WE'RE CONDUCTING MORE FREQUENT CLEANINGS OF COMMON AREAS. AND HIGH TOUCH SERVICES SUCH AS DOOR HANDLES ELEVATOR BUTTONS CONTINUING ON MARCH IS WHEN THINGS REALLY START TO COME TO A HEAD. AND THAT'S WHEN WE DEPLOYED OUR EMERGENCY TELEWORK PROGRAM. WE THOUGHT THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT WE- DO AND SO BEFORE WE EVEN RECEIVED DIRECTION FROM STATE LEADERSHIP WE DECIDED. LET'S FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE FOR THE LOTTERY. AND WE STARTED IMPROVING AND WALKING UP OUR- ELECTRONIC INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT FOLKS AT HOME. AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT- OUR- FOLKS WERE WORKING- INTEL WORKING CAPACITY RANGE FROM 75% 290% OF OUR EMPLOYEES DEPENDING ON THE DATE. AND THE NEEDS. AND OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES DIVISION HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL MAKING THAT SUCCESSFUL. IN ADDITION WE ALSO STARTED WORK SCHEDULES TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAD SOCIAL DISTANCING AND WE PUT IN PLACE AS DRAWN UP BY OUR HUMAN RESOURCE DEPARTMENT SPECIFIC SOCIAL THIS THE SAME PROTOCOLS USING THE PP STAYING APART- AND OTHER THINGS THAT WILL HELP PEOPLE STAY SAFE. HEARING ON IN MARCH AMONG THE THINGS WE DID WAS WE CLOSED OUR NINE DISTRICT OFFICES PUBLIC. WE ALSO CLOSER HEADQUARTERS BUILDING YOU'RE IN SACRAMENTO. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE COULD DO WHAT WE COULD TO LIMIT THE SPREAD AND THAT BECAME VERY IMPORTANT FOR US. WE'VE ADVISE FOLKS THROUGH MULTIPLE CHANNELS THAT HAVE LOTTERY PRIZES THAT THEY WANT TO REGAIN THE CAN STILL DO THAT. ONE OF THE KEY THINGS THAT OUR TEAM MEMBERS DO IS THEY ACTUALLY. VISIT RETAILERS TO CHECK ON THEIR NEEDS AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE FULLY STOCKED OUR PRODUCTS. AND WE'VE HAD TO PUT IN CONTROLS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S DONE REMOTELY. USUALLY BY TELEPHONE. SO THAT WE CAN WIN AGAIN LIMIT CONTACTED NGUYEN SPREAD. IN ADDITION. SENSITIVE TO- THE ANXIETY AND THE PUBLIC. AMONG THE THINGS THAT WE DID WAS WE PAUSE OUR PROMOTIONAL ADVERTISING DURING THIS PANDEMIC. BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE GOING TO THE STORE JUST. BUY LOTTERY TICKETS- YOU KNOW FOLKS GONNA WANT TO BUY IF THEY WANT TO BUY BUT WE DIDN'T WANT TO. DO THE TYPICAL ADVERTISING THAT WE NORMALLY DO BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO KEEP THIS- UP DOWN PLATE. IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. ARE WE ALSO SLOW THE ROLL OUT WITH SOME OF OUR GAMES INCLUDING- BEGIN THAT SPRING. PRACTICE WE'RE HOPING TO ONCE THAT LATER WHEN TIMES ARE MORE PROGRAM. THANK YOU THE OTHER PART OF MY QUESTION IS HOW MANY. CASES HAVE BEEN REPORTED AMONG EMPLOYEES AND ONE OF THE PROTOCOLS. WHEN AN EMPLOYEE TEST POSITIVE. WERE SYMPTOMATIC. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION TODAY WE HAVE ONE SELF REPORTED CASE OF AN EMPLOYEE THAT IS STILL SUFFERING SOMETIMES- DURING THE ENTIRE PANDEMIC WE HAD A TOTAL TO SELF REPORTED CASES- BUT RIGHT NOW THERE'S JUST ONE THAT IS IN KEEPING. ARE STILL DEALING WITH THE OCTOBER NINETEEN BUYERS ARE PROTOCOLS AND WE FIND OUT THAT- THIS IS HAPPENED IS WE FIRST DIRECT THOSE IMMEDIATE FACILITIES BE DEEP CLEAN AND WE NOTIFY THE OTHER PERSONNEL IN THE AREA WE MAY HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH ABSOLUTE. THANK YOU MY FINAL QUESTION. HOW DO YOU RECONCILE OR QUARTER THE- PROGRAMS OF THE LOTTERY. YOUR MISSION IS TO MAXIMIZE SALES BUT WE KNOW THERE ARE SOME PROBLEM GAMBLERS- PEOPLE WHO ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO. THE DISEASE OF GAMBLING. AND YOU HAVE INTERMEDIARIES MARKETING THE TICKETS AT RETAIL CENTERS- WHAT DOES THE LOTTERY DUE TO. ON THE ONE HAND MAXIMIZE SALES BUT ON THE OTHER HAND TO PROTECT THOSE FOR WHOM. THIS IS NOT AN ENJOYABLE. PAST TIME BUT A PREOCCUPATION IN A IN A DISEASE. WELL WE MARKET THE LOTTERY AS ENTERTAINMENT BUT IT IS GAMBLING AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE FOR MANY MANY YEARS IS SUPPORT PROBLEM GAMBLING PROGRAMS IN CAMPAIGNS INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE THE ONE IN HUNDRED GAMBLER HOTLINE- WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT FOLKS WHO HAVE A PROBLEM GET HELP.
