START WITH THE OVERVIEW OF THE DH YES BUDGET- THE MISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT IS TO PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS WITH ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE INTEGRATED HIGH QUALITY HEALTHCARE INCLUDING MEDICAL DENTAL MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT SERVICES AND LONG TERM CARE. TO FULFILL OUR MISSION THE DEPARTMENT FINANCES MINISTERS A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL HEALTH CARE DELIVERY PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE STATE'S MEDICAID PROGRAM OR MEDICARE WHICH PROVIDES HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO LOW INCOME PERSONS AND FAMILIES TO MEET DEFINED ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. THIS IMPORTANT STATE FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP PROVIDES VITAL HEALTH CARE TO OVER FOURTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION OR ABOUT ONE IN THREE CALIFORNIANS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT POINT THREE BILLION FOR THE BUDGET YEAR OF THAT- ONE POINT THREE FIVE BILLION AS FOUR STATE OPERATIONS INCLUDING FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR EMPLOYEES. AT A. HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN BILLION FOR OUR LOCAL ASSISTANCE. IN RESPONSE YOUR QUESTIONS ON THE AGENDA- DHS WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HEARING AID COVERAGE FOR CHILDREN PROGRAM. AS OF FEBRUARY TWENTY THIRD. FORTY SIX CHILDREN ARE ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM OUR VENDOR MAXIMIZES CURRENTLY REACHING OUT TO AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY TWO FAMILIES SUBMITTED PARTIAL APPLICATIONS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE MISSING INFORMATION AND COMPLETE ELIGIBILITY REVIEW FOR THESE CHILDREN. PRIOR TO THE LAUNCH IN JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND I'M GOING TO TEACH YES CONVENE STAKEHOLDER WORKGROUPS TO INFORM APPLICATION PROCESS REFINEMENT IN BENEFIT STRUCTURE AND ON GROWING PROGRAM ENHANCEMENTS TO ENSURE THE PROGRAM IS APPROPRIATELY AND ADEQUATELY SERVING ITS INTENDED POPULATION. WITH KNOWLEDGE HOWEVER THE PROGRAM REFINEMENTS ARE STILL NEEDED ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS AND ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON A PLAN TO INCREASE CHILD ENROLLMENT BUYING GREEN APPLICATIONS AND INFORMATIONAL MATERIALS WHEN INFANTS ARE REFERRED. FOR HEARING RELATED SERVICES DUE TO CALIFORNIA'S NEWBORN HEARING SCREENING PROGRAM AND EXTENDING THE TIME ALLOWED A TOTAL OF SIXTY DAYS FOR APPLICANTS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO COMPLETE AN ACTIVE APPLICATION RATHER THAN NEEDING TO REAPPLY. BUT PLAN TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION OF QUALIFIED PROVIDERS THERE'S SOME CONFUSION REGARDING THE PROGRAM PROVIDER DIRECTORY PROVIDERS DO NOT NEED TO OPT IN TO FIND A PROVIDER WEBPAGE INCLUDES MEDI CAL PROVIDERS. I CCS PROVIDERS AND COMMUNICATION DISORDER CLINICS. DHS'S TRYING TO MAXIMIZE OUR FEE FOR SERVICE MEDICARE PROVIDERS THROUGH THE STATE TO RENDER PROGRAM COVERED BENEFITS. THIS LEVERAGES PROVIDERS THAT ARE FAMILIAR WITH EXISTING PAPER SERVICE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION AND CLAIMS POLICIES. WE ARE ALSO OFFERING PUBLIC PROVIDER WEBINARS TAILORED TRAINING Q. AND A SESSIONS FOR MEDICAL TEAMS PROVIDER NETWORKS AND EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AND DIRECT INQUIRY SUPPORT. WE'RE ALSO UPDATING OUR BILLING CODES ON A ROLLING BASIS AS NEW CODES ARE ADDED OR REVISED FOR COMPLIANCE OR BASED ON FURTHER MEDICAL RESEARCH AND SUBJECT TO THE SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM AT THE READY TO COVER HEARING AIDS AND HEARING RELATED SERVICES. HOWEVER WE RECOGNIZE THERE'S A LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH THIS NEW RELATIVELY NEW PROGRAM AND WE'RE ADDRESSING THIS THROUGH TARGETED PROVIDER OUTREACH AND SUPPORT YOUR QUARTERLY PROVIDER WEBINARS. INCLUDING ONE SCHEDULED FOR MARCH SEVENTEENTH. EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE NEWBORN HEARING SCREENING PROGRAM. CONTINUED STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT YOUR MONTHLY UPDATES VIA THAT MEDIC HEALTH CONSUMER FOCUS STAKEHOLDER WORKGROUP. AND AD HOC DISCUSSIONS WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS REGARDING PROCEDURAL IMPROVEMENTS ARE RICH OPPORTUNITIES AND PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS. YOUR THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT FINANCE. NOTHING FURTHER FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANK YOU WE'RE JUST NOT IN THE BUDGET INCLUDES A SUBSTANTIAL PROPOSED INCREASED- DETAIL IN GENERAL FUND SPENDING BETWEEN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE WHICH TRANSLATES TO ABOUT A 30% INCREASE YEAR OVER YEAR OR ABOUT 80% OF THIS EIGHTY BILLION DOLLAR INCREASE FOR FAST TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENTS WHEN THE REMAINING 20% REFLECT NEW DISCRETIONARY PROPOSALS WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. THESE ISSUES WILL BE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL ON THE NEXT PANEL THANK YOU. THANK YOU DR ANYTHING ON THIS. YES THE DIRECTOR BOSSY MEANT I'D MAYBE I MISSED IT I HEARD YOU SAID- THAT WE HAVE FORTY SIX. PEOPLE ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM DID YOU MENTION HOW MANY HAVE ACTUALLY RECEIVED HEARING AIDS SOME HEARING AIDS IN THE DISPENSING THIS PROGRAM. YOU WANT ME TO RESPOND SO- GIVEN THAT THE TIME LAPSE IN REGARDS TO YOU WITH IT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED VERSES BUILD IN STAR THIS IS JC COULD BURST OF MEDICAID DIRECTOR- WEEK WE DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER OF HOW MANY HEARING AIDS HAVE BEEN DISPENSED AT THIS TIME. GIVEN THE CURRENT CLAIMS LAG SO I'M HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THAT REPORT OUT AS WE HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OKAY SO I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I NOTED HERE FROM SOME OF THE ADVICE OF THE ADVOCATES REPORTED THE LEAST- AND ARE RIGHT UP- SEVEN I REALIZE THAT. HE SAID MAY BE CLAIMS LIKE. SO FORTY SIX ENROLLED HOW MANY SHOULD WE BE IN ROLLING I MEAN YOU OBVIOUSLY WE'VE BUDGETED FUNDS IN THE PAST YOU KNOW FOR THE PAST YEAR ACTUALLY COUPLE YEARS- SO FORTY SIX OUT OF HOW MANY- SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENROLLED ARE ARE ARE WHAT WAS OUR GOAL FOR ENROLLMENT. IN THIS PROGRAM. SO I DON'T THINK WE NECESSARILY HAD A- GOAL FOR THE PROGRAM JUST TO BE CLEAR I THINK THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROBABLY GET THE INFORMATION OUT TO PROVIDERS TO BENEFICIARIES COMMUNICATE PEOPLE REGARDS THE ACCESS. I THINK IT'S A HARD ONE FOR US TO KNOW WHAT OTHER INSURANCES ARE AND ARE NOT COVERING IN REGARDS TO THE% NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD. I BE NEEDING THESE SERVICES I THINK RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO REALLY COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH PROVIDERS AND FAMILIES- IT'S YOU KNOW THROUGH THE NORMAL CHANNELS- AS DIRECTOR BOSS MENTIONED. OUT TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF THE PROGRAM AND THAT THEY COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PROGRAM IF THEY NEED TO. I'M SO IT'S A IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN OUR NORMAL PROGRAMS WHERE WE HAVE ENROLLED POPULATION- AND WE HAVE SOME MORE. AVAILABILITY AND INSIGHT INTO WHO SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE AND HOW TO GET THAT WORD OUT SO IT IS A NEW PROGRAM WE KNOW PEOPLE ARE GETTING USED TO IT. I'M SO WE'RE TRYING TO REALLY I'D YOU KNOW WORK THROUGH THOSE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION SO UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE THAT. A GOAL OR A NUMBER IN MIND. HELLO MELISSA THIS WAY AT LEAST TO DEVELOP THAT BUDGETARY NUMBER BY WE HAVE A CS CASE PROJECTIONS SUPPORT SOMEONE MUST HAVE. AT LEAST COME UP WITH A NUMBER TO SAY. WE ANTICIPATED THIS IS HOW MANY PEOPLE KNOW IT'S CLEARLY I GUESS WITH FORTY SIX I ASSUME THAT'S GOING TO LOWER NUMBER DOES THAT THAT THAT WAS NOT WHAT WAS ANTICIPATED- THERE WAS MUST HAVE BEEN SOME. ESTIMATE MADE AS TO HOW MANY PEOPLE I MEAN SOMETIMES ARE WRONG I GET IT I MEAN I'VE BEEN ON BUDGET FOR AWHILE- BUT- USUALLY LIKE WHETHER IT'S THIS OR YOU KNOW OUR WORLD MEDIC COW CASELOAD OR- SOCIAL SERVICE CASE LOAD HOW MANY PEOPLE SIGN UP FOR E. I. T. C. I CAN JUST ROLL PROGRAM AFTER PROGRAM OVER AND THAT'S HOW WE DEVELOP A BUDGET- SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT- AND I GUESS IN THE PAST. LAST YEAR- WHICH IS THE YEAR YOU KNOW WE DID BUDGET FUNDS FOR THIS. THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME PROJECTION EIGHTY FIVE WHETHER IT'S SPEECH CS OR BY THE PART OF FINANCE FOR NUMBER. PEOPLE EXPECTED TO BE ENROLLED. I WOULD SAY THAT THE BUDGET DID THIS. MYSTIC HIGHER. NUMBER INDIVIDUAL. BASED ON JUST A- OF THIS. WHO BUT- WE COULD. I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT THE BUDGET ESTIMATE WAS- SITE NEAR VERY INCREASED IN REGARDS TO WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING- I WOULD NEED TO GO BACK IN. AND THEN CONSULT WITH THE TEAM- I DOCTOR PAN AND HAPPY TO OFF LINE IN REGARDS TO WHAT WAS ASSUMED IN THE BUDGET. I DON'T HAVE THOSE EXACT NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT. IT'S TIME I GUESS IN THE TAXI. NOW THAT THE MORE IMPORTANT QUESTION ACTUALLY IS AND WHAT LAST YEAR BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WHAT THE RESULT OF A LOWER BODY FOR THIS COMING YEAR. RIGHT SO MAYBE THAT WAS MADE BY RENEE REVISED BUT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW. YEAH I'D REALIZE YOU'RE TRYING TO OUT REACH AND SO FORTH BUT- WE NEED SOME BENCHMARKS TO MEASURE OUR- LEVEL OF SUCCESS OR FAILURE. AND SO WHAT IS THE ANTICIPATED ENROLLMENT. FOR THE COMING. FISCAL YEAR. AND AND THEN WE CAN CERTAINLY- WHEN THERE'S ANOTHER HEARING A YEAR LATER READ IT AND REVISIT THAT AND SAY OKAY WERE WE SUCCESSFUL OR NOT SO I REALIZE YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RE DIRECT SOME RESOURCES TO. REACH IN OTHER TYPES OF THINGS. RECOGNIZING THAT WE ONLY HAVE FORTY SIX ENROLLED HEADSET. SO SOMETHING DEFINITELY DIDN'T WORK RIGHT THERE- BUT I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THANK YOU MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN GOING BACK LAST YEAR PERHAPS- FOCUS THE EFFORTS ON WAS SO WHAT. WHAT DO WE ANTICIPATE. SHOULD BE THAN ROMAN FOR THIS COMING YEAR. RIGHT AND WHAT ARE YOU. AND THEN HOW THAT FACTOR INTO THE BUDGET BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY HOW MANY PEOPLE. SHOULD BE AND HOW WITH THE NUMBERS COME UP YOU KNOW HOW THAT NUMBER WAS DEVELOPED- BECAUSE- WE CERTAINLY HAVE DATA ON. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT THERE WHO- YOU MAY NEED THE SERVICES I REALIZED THAT- YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME. COMPLICATED TERMS A FIGURE OUT OF COVERAGE AND SO FORTH BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVE A SENSE OF THE- I THINK THERE'S THERE ARE. THERE'S DATA ABOUT THE PREVALENCE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HEARING IMPAIRED WHO- WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM THIS PROGRAM. YEAH I AGREE I MY TEAM ACTUALLY ABLE TO PING ME- DURING HEARING IT LOOKS THE BUDGET- WHAT BUILT ON A- ON AN ANNUAL. A FULL. ONCE WE GET UP. AROUND TO SEVEN THOUSAND. SO AGAIN YEAH BURIED. A LOT OF MORE IN THE BUDGET THAN WHAT. I PRESUME YOU'RE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- DO ADDITIONAL ANALYTICS TO UNDERSTAND- WHAT DROVE TO THE TO THE SIX OR SEVEN THOUSAND BUT- THAT CLEARLY. LESS THAN FIVE YOU KNOW WHAT'S CURRENTLY ARE. SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN WHAT'S CURRENTLY RECEIVING PROGRAM I. GUESS SO- AND I'M SURE WE'LL HEAR FROM- THE WITNESSES BUT CLEARLY THIS DID NOT WORK IF WE ONLY GOT FORTY SIX OR DISSIPATING SIX TO SEVEN THOUSAND SELL SOMETHING SOMETHING'S GONE TERRIBLY WRONG HERE. AND HOPEFULLY- WE'LL HEAR FROM. THE WITNESSES AS TO STRAP SOME IDEAS OF HOW WE CAN FIX IT AND WHAT WE RESOURCES WE NEED TO PUT INTO IT TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS. THANK YOU- THIRTY BUCKS TO WIN DO WE KNOW THE ENTIRE POPULATION THAT EXISTS WHO WHO DON'T HAVE HEARING AIDS AND WOULD. WOULDN'T THIS WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THAT NUMBER IS THAT THE SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND I THINK THAT THAT THAT IS OUR ESTIMATE SIX TO SEVEN THOUSAND- THAT COULD THAT COULD MEET THESE THESE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA OKAY AND WHAT'S THE BIGGEST BARRIER TO GETTING THE WORD OUT DO YOU KNOW. I MEAN IT IT'S A NEW PROGRAM- AND SO AND YOU KNOW IT'S- IT'S A LITTLE BIT SPECIALIZE BECAUSE IT'S NOT THE MEDICAL PROGRAM IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THAT THE TRADITIONAL WAYS WE DO OUTREACH- GENERALLY THESE. THESE FAMILIES HAVE SOME TYPE OF COVERAGE AND SO HOW DO WE- DO WE NEED TO KIND OF WORK ON OUR MECHANISMS TO DO NOT REACH THE PROVIDER- EDUCATION- AND SOME OF THE- BED THAT TARGETED OUTREACH THAT WE DISCUSSED- THAT WE'RE WE'RE WORKING THROUGH. THANK YOU WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THIS PROGRESSES OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. I'M SORRY. WE S. AND NOW WE'LL TURN TO OUR WITNESSES FOR THEIR INPUT PEOPLE. WE APPRECIATE YOU COMING TODAY AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR BRAVERY OF SHOWING UP HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE ROOM DURING A PANDEMIC. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO CALIFORNIA PLEASE GO AHEAD. HELLO MY NAME IS KIM ME WHEN. HELLO SENATOR PAN IT'S REALLY NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN I WAS HERE TO TESTIFY TWO YEARS AGO. AND THAT WAS FOR THE LEAD CALIFORNIA HEARING BILL SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SUPPORTING THAT SINGLE MOTHER AND I'M FROM THE SACRAMENTO AREA. I HAVE TWO GIRLS WITH ME AND YOU'VE MET THEM BEFORE THEY WERE WITH ME THE LAST TIME I CAME TO SPEAK. I'VE ADVOCATED FOR THIS BILL FOR MANY MANY YEARS AND I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED THAT THAT DIDN'T PASS BUT IT WAS A HUGE RELIEF. ALAS MY PLACE I'M SORRY ONE MOMENT- IT WAS A RELIEF TO SEE THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE SOME COVERAGE FOR HEARING AIDS STARTING IN JULY. BUT I WAS DEVASTATED TO FIND OUT THE MY DAUGHTER'S WOULDN'T QUALIFY BECAUSE I ME PARTIAL COVERAGE I WORK FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I DO HAVE SOME INSURANCE BUT THE INSURANCE ONLY COVERS ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THE SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A COST. FOR HEARING AIDS THAT MEANS THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS EVERY THREE YEARS FOR MY DAUGHTER'S HEARING AIDS. BECAUSE THE MOLDS IN THE HEARING AIDS THEMSELVES CHANGE. AND NOT ONLY THAT NOW I WORK WHICH ALSO MEANS THAT I HAVE TO TRAVEL TO UCSF IN SAN FRANCISCO BECAUSE THERE'S NO LOCAL PROVIDER IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA. SO I HAVE TO TRAVEL LARGE DISTANCES TO FIND A PROVIDER THAT WILL PROVIDE THE SERVICES. NOW MY DAUGHTER SHE WROTE A STORY ONE TIME ABOUT HOW MUCH MY MOM WORKS AND THE STRESS THAT THIS CAUSES. SO I HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE SOME SERIOUS CHANGES TO THIS PROGRAM THE FORMER PROVIDE ME RELIEF AND ALSO RELIEF TO ALL THE FAMILIES WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING HEARING AIDS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. OKAY. HI MY NAME IS NANCY. AND I AM READY FOR THE RETIRED DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING PROGRAM CONSULTANT AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I AM CURRENTLY A BOARD MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA HANDS AND VOICES WHICH IS THE LARGEST FAMILY ORGANIZATION CONNECTION- AND FOR FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA. IF THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS WITH THE HACCP AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE TWO OF THE LARGEST PROBLEMS FOR FAMILIES ONE IS THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH PROVIDERS FOR THE PROGRAMS FOR FAMILIES FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HAVE TO TRAVEL TO THE BAY AREA TO GET SERVICES THIS INCLUDES FAMILIES FROM SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY ALL THE WAY TO THE NORTH. THE WAY NORTH TO THE OREGON BORDER. IN FACT IS THE FAMILY'S WHO HAVE INSURANCE THAT COVERS PART OF THE COST F THEIR HEARING AIDS HAVE TO COVER THE REMAINING COSTS THEMSELVES THEY'RE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM. AND THIS MIGHT BE SEVERAL THOUSAND DOLLARS. FAMILIES NEED YOUR HELP THE ACC'S FIFTY. AM IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. BUT THE HACCP IS NOT AS UPSET AND SAID THAT DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM THAT FAMILIES FACE. IT THANK YOU. NEXT PERSON PLEASE. HELLO MY NAME. I AM ELEVEN YEARS OLD AND WEAR HEARING. I DON'T CARE IF. OKAY. HELLO MY NAME IS MARIA I'M A LEVIN AND WE'RE HEARING AIDS I'VE BEEN COMING TO SACRAMENTO SINCE FIRST GRADE TO ADVOCATE FOR CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO HEARING AIDS I WANT TO THANK YOU THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR FOR RECOGNIZING THAT NEED TO HELP FAMILIES STRUGGLE TO PAY FOR THEIR KIDS HERE HE IS WITH THIS PROGRAM. IT MAKES US FEEL SEEN CARED FOR. I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU FOR YOUR AGAIN. I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF PEDIATRIC PROVIDERS. PURPOSE HEATING IN THIS PROGRAM. I HAVE ACCESS BECAUSE MY PARENTS ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE PRIVATIZED. I LEARNED THAT SOME CHILDREN ARE ARE YOU A THREE TO SIX MONTHS TO GET IN TO SEE A PROVIDER. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE. NOT TO MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE HALF FULL ACCESS INSTRUCTION IN THE CLASSROOM. FOR THAT MONTH. I KNOW AND FEEL POWERLESS DISCONNECTED LEFT OUT OF ME. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME CHILDREN WHO NEED THE INCOME ELIGIBILITY THAT ARE BEING LEFT OUT. I BELIEVE WE CAN CHANGE SIX. HOW DOES MAKE H. AC HE WORK FOR CHILDREN IN NEED SO THEY CAN REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL I LOOK FORWARD TO COMING BACK NEXT YEAR JAMES STORIES OF ALL THE CHILDREN'S LIVES HE CHANGED. HI MY NAME IS MICHELLE- THIS IS MY DAUGHTER MARIE I'M THE CHAIR OF LET CALIFORNIA KIDS HERE WE'RE A COALITION OF PARENTS IN PEDIATRIC PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATES. WE WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE AND THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR RECOGNIZING THIS NEED- THAT THAT FAMILIES HAVE- NEARLY NINE MONTHS IN WITH SIX POINT SEVEN TO ADMINISTER A TEN MILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM. ONLY FORTY SIX CHILDREN HAVE BEEN ENROLLED AND ONLY SEVEN ARE KNOWN TO HAVE RECEIVED HEARING AIDS I HAVE SPOKEN TO THE EIGHT CENTERS WHO HAVE OPTED IN WITHIN THIS WEEK AND WE KEEP A RUNNING TALLY- THE BIGGEST ISSUE PARENTS FACE IS FINDING A PEDIATRIC PROVIDER TO SERVE CHILDREN. DH CS REPORTS THERE'S TWENTY EIGHT PEDIATRIC PROVIDERS WHO HAVE OPTED IN TO SERVE CHILDREN BUT ONE CENTER WHO LISTED FIFTEEN OF THEIR AUDIOLOGIST HAS DECIDED THEY CAN ONLY AFFORD. TO DEDICATE ONE SO THAT IS FOURTEEN PEDIATRIC AUDIOLOGIST TO SERVE SEVEN THOUSAND ELIGIBLE ELIGIBLE CHILDREN. LARGE PEDIATRIC PROVIDERS- THAT HAVE NOT OPTED IN SIGHT ASCENTIAL PEDIATRIC CODES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PUBLISHED TO DATE WITH REIMBURSEMENT RATES- AND THAT THE THAT THE RATES ARE EVEN LOWER THAN CCS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND ONE. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WE WENT FROM A PROVIDER'S TWO THREE PROVIDERS. IN LOS ANGELES IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE LARGEST PEDIATRIC CENTER CLOSE DOWN TO THE PARAMEDICS AND REIMBURSEMENT RATES ANOTHER ONE WENT IN IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THEY CLOSE THEIR DOORS IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- IN DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE MANY FAMILIES WORKING UNDER THE 6100% FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL COULD BENEFIT FROM THIS PROGRAM BUT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE ONE OF TWO SCENARIOS THEIR CHILD IS APPROVED AND THEY CAN'T FIND A PEDIATRIC PROVIDER IN THE COUNTY THAT ACCEPTS THE PROGRAM. THESE CHILDREN ESPECIALLY THOSE UNDER THE AGE OF FIVE WILL NEED TO BE SEEN MULTIPLE TIMES A YEAR AS OUR LITTLE YOURS GROW THEIR WORKING PARENTS WILL NEED TO TRAVEL GREAT DISTANCES TO THE NEAREST PROVIDER WHO'S OPTED INTO X. TO EXPERIENCE THREE TO SIX MONTHS WAIT TIME AND THEY WILL BE MISSING CRITICAL DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES DURING THIS TIME THERE ARE NO PARTICIPATING PROVIDERS IN THE GREATER SACRAMENTO AREA. THERE ARE NO PARTICIP THERE ARE NO PARTICIPATING PROVIDERS FIFTY OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. WITH 25% OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN IN LOS ANGELES THERE'S ONLY ONE SMALL PEDIATRIC PRACTITIONER IN BURBANK- THIRTY. OKAY THE SECOND NARROWS THEIR CHILD IS DENIED BECAUSE OUR HEALTH PLAN THEY PAY FOR HAS PARTIAL COVERAGE BETWEEN FIVE AND A THOUSAND TO PAY FOR SIX THOUSAND DOLLAR HEARING AIDS. OR THEY HAVE A TEACHER MICROTIA AND THERE YOUR CANALS ARE NOT DEVELOPED AND THEY NEED A BONE CONDUCTION HEARING AID THAT CODE HASN'T BEEN APPROVED YET. AND THEY HAVE TO CHOOSE THEY THEY HAVE TO PAY BETWEEN TEN AND TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THAT DEVICE. WE HEARD SO GRATEFUL FOR THE ALLOCATION THAT YOU GUYS HAVE RECOGNIZED THIS IS A NEED IN OUR STATE. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE SOLUTIONS TO ENSURE THIS PROGRAM IT ACHIEVES ITS INTENDED PURPOSE. THE ESTIMATE. YOU CAN LOOK AT THE TWO BIRTH DATA IT IS SEVEN THOUSAND CHILDREN THAT WERE PROJECTED TO BE SERVED IN THE STATE WITH THIS PROGRAM- ABOUT TO ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THOSE-CHILDREN SHOULD BE COMING THROUGH THE DOOR EVERY YEAR. SO ABOUT TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE. BECAUSE HEARING AIDS REPLACED EVERY THREE YEARS THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO SPEAK ON THIS TODAY. OKAY DR- SO I DIDN'T HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS FOR- DH CS AFTER WE'VE HEARD THIS TESTIMONY BECAUSE- IF YOU KNOW YOUR TESTIMONY TALKED ABOUT OUTREACH AND CERTAINLY- THERE MAY BE IGNORANCE OF THE PROGRAM BUT WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE WITNESSES THAT. THERE ARE A PROVIDER SO I MEAN I REPRESENT SACRAMENTO SACRAMENTO REGION I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU LIVE HERE- WE'RE A LARGE METROPOLITAN AREA I MEAN WE'RE IN THE TOP FIFTY FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY. AND THERE'S NO PROVIDER. THE RESULTS ARE HEARING YOU CORRECT ME IF THE IF THEY'RE WRONG PLEASE PLEASE CORRECT ME- ARE CORRECT US- YOU KNOW IF YOU HEARD LOS ANGELES. PERHAPS SOME OF THE LARGEST METROPOLITAN AREAS IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY- HAS SOUNDS LIKE AS ONE. SO SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A NETWORK ISSUE HERE AS WELL I MEAN WE CAN WE CAN GO AND TRY TO MAKE PEOPLE EVER PROGRAM BUT WHEN PEOPLE GO AND TRY TO ACCESS A PROGRAM AND THEY FIND OUT THAT. THERE'S NO PROVIDER. AND THEY'RE STILL STUCK WITH A HUGE PORTION OF THE COST I CAN IMAGINE THAT IT'S NOT LACK OF AWARENESS ANYMORE ACTUALLY IT IS AWARENESS TEN DAYS. THEN DECIDED IT'S- NOT REALLY HELPING THAT MUCH. SO SO I KNOW YOU'RE DOING LOTS OF OUT REACH AND SO FORTH CONTINUES PLEASE SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF ADEQUATE NETWORKS. LOTS OF PEOPLE HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR DISTANCES- TO GET. THE HELP THEY NEED WE'RE GONNA DO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO ABOUT THE REIMBURSEMENT PAYMENT- SO THAT DID IT SO THAT KNOWING MORE PROVIDERS SO THAT MORE OF THIS GETS COVERED- SO I MEAN THESE AND THEN YOU KNOW BUT THE WAIT TIMES. CERTAINLY IS A DEVELOPMENTAL PEDIATRICIAN. THREE SIX MONTHS FOR A YOUNG CHILD IS A LONG PERIOD OF TIME FOR THEM NOT TO BE ABLE TO GET HELP. SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE GOALS ARE IN TERMS OF WEIGHT TIME PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNG CHILDREN WEAR HEARING SPRINKLE FOR LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT. AND IT BY NOT ADDRESSING THIS CASE- WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY OF COURSE FOR THE CHILD IN TERMS OF THEIR OWN HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT- BUT- EVEN FOR THE STATE AND THEN AT THE WHAT DOESN'T THE- INCREASES COSTS FOR THINGS LIKE SPECIAL EDUCATION OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT- BECAUSE WE MISS CRITICAL PERIODS OF DEVELOPMENT. SO I CAN WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT NETWORK ADEQUACY. REIMBURSEMENT AND- QUALITY STANDARDS FOR. PEOPLE. BEING ABLE TO GET SERVICES IN THIS PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR QUESTIONS WE'RE GOING. OVER TO JUSTIN DEPUTY ENGINE WEIGHING. THANK YOU. MORNING TIME THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS- I THINK FIRSTLY JUST TO ACKNOWLEDGE I THINK WE ARE WORKING- VERY DILIGENTLY AND CLOSELY AND WITH OUR AFRICAN PARTNERS TO HAVE SHARED THEIR TESTIMONIES BEFORE EACH DAY- AND WANTED TO BE CLEAR THAT THE HEARING AIDS COVERAGE FOR CHILDREN PROGRAMS THE BENEFIT STRUCTURE AND THE IT AND THE PROVIDER NETWORKS ARE BASED ON THE MEDIC HEALTHY FOR SERVICE NETWORK. THE WE DO WELCOME ALL PEDIATRIC AUDIOLOGY PROVIDERS IN THE MEDICAL FIELD FOR SERVICE OUR NETWORK TO ALSO PURCHASED HE HAS AN H. K. C. C. P. OUR PROVIDER AS WELL AND I THINK WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE- THAT WE HAVE A QUITE A BIT OF WORK IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE CLARIFYING- THE PROVIDER DIRECTORY ALAN THAT'S CURRENTLY ON THE LINE- AND DEFINITELY A LOT MORE WORK IN TERMS OF STREAMLINING SOME OF OUR PROGRAM CHRISTIE. ARE BUT WANTED TO BE CLEAR THAT WE DO HAVE A LOT OF WORK AHEAD OF US- AND THAT THE PROGRAM ITSELF IS BASED UPON THE MEDIC COUNTY FOR SERVICE MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE- WE ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT ADDITIONAL CODES- IN TERMS OF ADDING MORE US THIS IS AS IN CONVERSATIONS- WITH OUR- PROVIDER NETWORKS ARE PARTICIPATING STAKEHOLDERS- AS WELL AS- SOME OF THE CLOSE REACHED. THE WORK ON- WHAT THOSE I THINK- A LOT WORK TO BE DONE- AND DEAF COULD BE SOME THAT WE LOOK TO WORK ON TO STREAMLINE- AND WE ARE LOOKING IN MARCH YOU HAVE A MORE OF A MORE ROBUST- PROVIDER WEB IN OUR- TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GETTING THE WORD. OUT ON AND THROUGH OUR- MINISTRY- VENDOR MAXIMUS WELL WE ARE DOING A LOT OF CONSUMER KIND OF OUTREACH WORK IN TERMS OF PUTTING CHEAPER FLYERS AND NEWSLETTERS. ALSO KIND OF RE LOOKING AT APPLICATION PROCESS- AND LOOKING AT WAYS TO STREAMLINE A MAKING REFINEMENTS. SO HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS OKAY WELL WELL OKAY AND AS I SAID THAT THE CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE IS THAT IF YOU DO OUTREACH TO FOLKS. AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE PROVIDER NETWORK. PEOPLE GO AND SAY OH. THIS PROGRAM ISN'T REALLY GOING TO BE A HELP ME RIGHT SO- SO I'M NOT SAYING DON'T DO OUTREACH TO THE COMMUNITY BUT WHAT WE JUST HEARD IS FROM PEOPLE ACTUALLY TRIED. THAT THERE'S A PROVIDER NETWORK RIGHT SO I THINK- AND YOU SAID YOU GOT A LOOK IN YOUR PROVIDER DIRECTORY AND SO FORTH SO- AND MAYBE YOU DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER TODAY BUT- WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE PROVIDER NETWORK FOR THIS PROGRAM. AND WE'RE GONNA DO TO ACHIEVE THAT. SO WHAT IS THE ENDPOINT SO YOU KNOW YOU TALKED A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT WHAT I LIKE TO KNOW IS HOW MANY PROVIDERS SHOULD THERE BE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT'S ITS DISTRIBUTION SO HOW FAR SHOULD ANYONE BE FROM ANY PARTICULAR CELLS ANY ANY PERSON WHO'S IN THIS PROGRAM. WHAT SHOULD BE THE CLOSEST PROVIDER FOR THEM. WHO ACCEPTS THIS PROGRAM HOW FAR AWAY RIGHT WE DO WE DO WE HAVE STANDARDS FOR THESE THINGS FOR YOU KNOW IT AND ENDED IN THE OVERALL. HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY AS WELL. HOSING SOME OF THESE STANDARDS ARE ON OUR MEDICAL PLANS OF COURSE ON A COMMERCIAL PLANS TO TEAMMATE SEATS AT A- SO WOULD LIKE TO SEE. SOME ANSWER IN TERMS OF WHAT IS THE PROVIDER NETWORK WE SHOULD HAVE BECAUSE AT LEAST WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS THAT IT'S AND- IT'S INSUFFICIENT. AND THAT YOU'RE A LOT LIKE WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON IT BUT- I'D LIKE TO KNOW LIKE WHAT THE END GOAL IS HOW DO WE KNOW WE'RE SUCCESSFUL WHAT WHAT IS WHAT IS THE- WHAT WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO GET TO YOU IN TERMS OF THAT PROVIDER NETWORK AND THEN. IN TERMS OF THE REIMBURSEMENT PIECE. I WASN'T HERE A LOT OF ANSWERS AROUND THAT SO WE- I GOT A SO I REALLY I HEAR THAT DO YOU TIED IT TO OUR FEE FOR SERVICE MEDICARE OUT BUT FOR SOME REASON AND MAYBE THAT'S PART OF THE REASON YOUR PROVIDER NETWORK IS INSUFFICIENT. SO I THINK SOMETHING THERE'S GOING TO NEED TO BE REVISITED AS WELL AM I WRONG. PAUL STEPPED IN AND RESPOND HERE. SENATOR PENCIL I THINK. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO BE CLEAR AS WELL ONE OF THE CONFUSING PARTS RIGHT NOW FROM. WHAT THE TEAM'S HEARING FROM PEOPLE IS THAT ON. THE LIST OF-CLINICAL OPTED IN PROVIDERS TECHNICALLY ALL EXISTING MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS. NCCS PROVIDERS ARE ELIGIBLE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES WERE TRYING TO CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE THE PROVIDER NETWORK IS A LOT LARGER- THAT. THAN WHAT IS BEING ARTICULATED- AND WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE PROVIDERS UNDERSTAND THAT THEY CAN. CLEARLY PROVIDE SERVICES TO THIS PROGRAM. EVEN THOUGH IT'S OUTSIDE OF THE OF MEDICARE L. THE REASON WHY WE ARE. MAKING SURE THAT ALL SEAT- MEDI CAL AND CCS PROVIDERS. ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES IS WHAT WE KNOW WE HAVE A LOT LARGER NETWORK ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THAT RIGHT. ALSO THEY UNDERSTAND HOW TO BILL. MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE THEY UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO- AUTHORIZATIONS IN MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE AND SO. WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S UNDERSTANDING- THOSE- PROVIDERS ARE AND WE WILL WORK DILIGENTLY WITH OUR TEAM. TO ENSURE THAT WE DO THAT FASTER JUST TO BE REALLY. FRANK AND THEN I THINK ON THE REIMBURSEMENT YOU KNOW YEAH WE ARE USING AND OURS WAS DESIGNED. IN THE PROPOSAL THE MEDIC HOW RATES- AND- YOU NEED YOU KNOW. ANY VARIANCE FROM THAT WE- NEED TO. DISCUSS HOW WE DO THAT. I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THE QUESTION AROUND CCS RATES YOU'RE THE ONLY AREA WHERE WE ARE. WE PAY A HIGHER RATE CCS IS BROWN PHYSICIAN SERVICES. IT'S A HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE PERCENT- THE MEDIC HOW- RATE. SO IT'S NOT ACROSS ALL OF THE SERVICES- JUST WANTED TO IT THAT THERE WAS A- A COMMENT ON THAT JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW. CCS RATES WORK ON THAT FRONT- BUT AGAIN. WE ARE LOOKING AT THAT BUT IF WE IF WE ARE MUSING THE- MEDICARE RATE IS THE BASE. ANYTHING DONE FOR THIS PROGRAM SEPARATELY YOU WOULD NEED TO DISCUSS THROUGH YOU KNOW BUDGET ESTIMATES. OF WHAT THOSE RATES WOULD LOOK LIKE AND I KNOW THAT THERE ARE. OTHER PROPOSALS ARE FLOATING AROUND IN. SPACE THAT WE HAVE TO ANALYZE. ANALYZE THOSE TWO TO MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT BASED ON THE ALLOCATION THE BUDGET. OKAY PREPARATION THAT SO THE HELP. THOUGH IS THAT SAID THERE'S A LOT ACTUALLY. FROM OUT IN- THERE THE- PERHAPS YOU'RE SAYING THAT ISN'T AWARE OF THEY CAN FROM. SERVICE AS PER. TO BE HELPFUL TO KNOW WHAT IS THAT NETWORK HOW HOW MANY HOW MANY PROVIDERS ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE IDEOLOGY PROVIDERS. SAYS AND- CERTAINLY YOU'RE DOING OUTREACH TO THOSE PROVIDERS SO WE NEED TO BE ON THE- GOOD TO KNOW THAT THAT NETWORKING ITSELF IS ADEQUATE- TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THIS POPULATION SO WE CAN GET TO THE- SIXTY SEVEN THOUSAND THAT. PROGRAMS PROJECTED TO GET TO. AND SEE THEIR CAPACITY TO AGAIN ABSORB. THE ADDITIONAL PATIENTS- HOPEFULLY THAT. THAT WILL BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROGRAM SO WE CAN HAVE SOME FOLLOW UP ON THAT- THAT WOULD BE GREAT. YEAH MORE THAN HAPPY TO GET YOU THE LIST OF. ALL THE AVAILABLE PROVIDERS IN VIEW FOR SERVICE IN CCS ACROSS THE STATE AND WE WILL DO. OUR DUE DILIGENCE TO COMMUNICATE TO THEM TO MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE PROVIDERS FOR THIS PROGRAM. WE DO HAVE IT ON OUR WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN DO IF YOU FIND FOR THOSE PROVIDERS BUT OF COURSE. IT CLEARLY THERE'S STILL CONFUSION AND SO WE WILL TAKE THAT UPON OURSELVES TO- TO REDUCE THAT CONFUSION TO THE LARGER NETWORK. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS COOPER THE END THIS IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS WHERE THE TELEMEDICINE SO HELPFUL WITH SO MANY ISSUES BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE THERE- ON SITE SO I DON'T KNOW IF WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH OUR NETWORK MAYBE WE THINK ABOUT SOME MOBILE SERVICES LIKE WE'RE WE'RE DO HAVING TO DO WITH MENTAL HEALTH RIGHT NOW AT LEAST TO ME TO WORK ON THAT SEVEN THOUSAND- I WILL BE INTERESTED TO SEE THE PROPOSALS THAT COME TO MAYBE. LOWER THE RATE SO WE CAN PROVIDE SOME MORE OF THAT COVERAGE FOR FAMILIES- MORE MORE THAN WHAT THEIR INSURANCE MIGHT PAY SO I THINK I THINK WE'LL FIND OUT A LOT OF THAT IS ALSO AN ISSUE OKAY SO LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUES NUMBER TWO IN THREE THIS IS THE PRESENTATION OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S TO LOCAL ASSISTANT ESTIMATES FOR MEDICAL AND FOR FAMILY HEALTH PROGRAMS. IT'S GOING TO DO THIS DIRECTOR BUS OKAY WELCOME BACK. THE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES- MEDICAL LOCAL SYSTEMS THAT NEED TO BE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE POINT EIGHT BILLION TOTAL FUNDS TWENTY SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION GENERAL FUND IN THE CURRENT YEAR. AT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION TOTAL FUNDS THIRTY FOUR POINT NINE BILLION GENERAL PLAN IN THE BUDGET YEAR I'M A HIGHLIGHT A SOME SIGNIFICANT GENERAL FUND CHANGES IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM IN BOTH THE CURRENT YEAR AND BUDGET YEAR. IN THE CURRENT YEAR WE SHOW A SLIGHT INCREASE OF. POINT 5% IN TOTAL SPENDING. TOWARD FINDING. THIS REFLECTS A FOUR POINT 7% DECREASE IN GENERAL FUND SPENDING COMPARED TO THE ESTIMATES. FROM THE BUDGET ENACTMENT LAST SUMMER. MAJOR DRIVERS OF THE CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATED GENERAL FUND SPENDING INCLUDED. ONE BILLION RELATED TO REDUCE CARBON NINETEEN COSTS. PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM ADDITIONAL SAVINGS FROM INCREASED F. MAP BEING AVAILABLE THROUGH JAN TWENTY TWENTY TWO YOU KNOW. AND THEN PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ADDITIONAL CASE THE COST- AT NEGATIVE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE MILLION- RELATED TO SHIFTING MULTI SPEND EACH MONTH TO YOUR SPENDING INTO LATER YEARS I MADE UP. SOME OF THESE CHANGES WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER IN THE AGENDA. A HUNDRED EIGHTY NINE MILLION DECREASE RELATED TO YOU- INCREASED FUNDING FROM HOSPITAL QUIET QUALITY ASSURANCE. FOR A CHILDREN'S COVERAGE- PORTION OF THAT. I HAVEN'T SEVENTY MILLION A DECREASE RELATED TO PROJECTED COSTS BARTEL AIM TRANSITIONING POPULATIONS. AND AN ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT MILLION. RELATED TO STATE ONLY CLAIM. FOR BUDGET YEAR WE PUT A SEVEN POINT. PERCENT AND IN TOLL FUNDING THIS REFLECTS A 30% INCREASE IN GENERAL FUND SPENDING COMPARED TO THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. OF GROWTH IN PROJECTED MEDICARE SPENDING AND THE BUDGET YOU'RE RELATES TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS- THAT AGAIN WE'LL BE DISCUSSING IN MORE DETAIL IN IT IF THE REST OF THE HEARING TODAY. I'M JUST TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW- OUR GENERAL FUND COSTS ARE PROJECTED TO GROW AT INCREASED FUNDING FOR MEDIC HOUSES SAME TO END WITH THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. OKAY SO IT'S REMAIN HIGHER THAN THEY OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN- IS CALLED LG BODIES GRADUALLY RICHARD SHERMAN OVER THAT- THE TWELVE MONTHS. OPEN GENERAL FINE TO A SPENDING ALSO. BY NUMBER PROPOSALS- FOR EXAMPLE THE FULL SCOPE THAT COVERAGE FOR OLDER ADULTS. THE BEHAVIOR HELP BRIDGE HOUSING. ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN AB NINETY SEVEN REDUCTIONS- THE REDUCTION OF MEDIC HELP RAYMOND PEAT PREMIUMS AND CO. PAYMENTS TO ZERO I'M JIM TODAY MY FUNERAL. IN IN REGARDS TO CASE LOAD ALL CONCLUDE WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE MEDICAL KEESLER PROJECTIONS. THE PANDEMIC HAS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS ENROLLED IN MEDI CAL. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A CONTINUOUS COVERAGE REQUIREMENT THAT IS TIED TO THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WHICH PREVENTS MOST IN JUST A MOMENT FROM THE PROGRAM- WE ASSUME THAT THE CASE THAT WILL GROW TO A PEAK OF ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION- AND THEN- ONCE ELIGIBILITY READ DETERMINATIONS HAPPEN THAT. THAT CASELOAD WILL BE REDUCED. GRADUALLY OVER TWELVE MONTHS. I WILL. FOR ANY QUESTION OR- J. MOVE ON TO THE FAMILY HELPED MET WITH MOVE ON TO FAMILY HEALTH ASSESSMENT. OKAY SO. ENTER OF OUR FAMILY HEALTH ESTIMATE. YOU WILL. THE FAMILY ALSO ESTIMATE- PROJECTS BY NEED FOR SPEED ONLY K. CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES OR CCS BUT JANET GENETICALLY HANDICAPPED PERSON PROGRAM G. H. P. P. AND EVERY WOMAN COUNTS FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR- WE PROJECT SPEND THE NEXT TWO HUNDRED FORTY NINE MILLION TOTAL FUNDS TWO HUNDRED TWO MILLION GENERAL FUND AND THIS IS A SIX POINT 4% DECREASE IN TOTAL FUNDING- AND- AND AS SIX POINT 9% DECREASE IN GENERAL FUND SPENDING COMPARED TO THE ESTIMATES FROM FROM THAT BUDGET ENACTED LAST SUMMER SH IN THE CURRENT YEAR THE MAIN FACTOR IN REDUCED. ESTIMATED SPENDING IS REDUCED COSTS RELATED TO COVER NINETEEN ENROLLMENT IMPACTS ENROLLMENT IN STATE ONLY CCS HAS DROPPED SOMEWHAT DURING THE PANDEMIC DUE TO INDIVIDUAL SHIFTING TO A MEDICAL CCS AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE UTILIZING SERVICES IN EVERY WOMAN COUNTS PROGRAM HAS ALSO BEEN SOMEWHAT LOWER SINCE THE BEGINNING CONDEMNING BEGAN ALTHOUGH WE SEE UTILIZATION INCREASING AND APPROACHING PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. FOR THE BUDGET YEAR WE PROJECT SPENDING SHOULD BE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE MILLION TOTAL FUNDS TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN MILLION GENERAL FUND AND THIS REFLECTS A SIXTEEN POINT FOUR AND TOTAL FUNDING AND A FIVE POINT 4% INCREASE IN GENERAL FUND SPENDING COMPARED TO THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. GROWTH IN THAT PROJECTED MEDICAL SPENDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE ASSUMPTION THAT REDUCED AND WILL BE THE KOPET NINETEEN IMPACTS. WILL PHASE OUT IN THE BUDGET YEAR. I THANK YOU NO ADDITIONAL COMMENT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU L. A. O. THANK YOU. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE MINISTERS IN CASE THOSE OPTIONS WE GENERALLY FIND THE LOCAL ASSISTANCE ESTIMATED TO BE REASONABLE- BUT WE WILL BE CONTINUING EVALUATES ONLINE ASSUMPTIONS OVER THE COMING MONTHS. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS INCLUDE THE CO IN NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ASSUMPTION CASELOAD AND THE EXPIRATION OF THE MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION. TALKS NCO TAX. WHAT ARE THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ATTENTION THIS IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY THE MEDICAID BUDGET. DOWN AND THIS YOU CAN EXPIRATION DATE OF THE- PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IS PARTICULARLY UNCERTAIN- THE END OF WHICH WILL TRIGGER THE END UP RELATED. OFFSET GENERAL FUND COSTS OF THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AS SUCH WHEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND IT WILL BE A LARGE INCREASE IN GENERAL COSTS. THE BUDGET IS SEEN AS A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ENDS JUNE TWENTY TWENTY TWO. UNDER THIS ASSUMPTION EXPRESSION AGAIN SHE WOULD RESULT IN NEARLY TWO POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS THE OVERALL NET GROWTH IN GENERAL FUND SPENDING JUNE. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. WE FIND THAT THIS ESTIMATE. WELL IT'S REASONABLE WE NOTE THAT CURRENTLY THAT PUBLIC HEALTH PURPOSES ONLY SET TO EXTEND. INTO APRIL OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- AND AGE WILL SHOULD ANNOUNCED RELATIVE SOON. PROVIDED AND WE NOTE THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH IN THE JUNE TWO TWENTY WHAT IS IN SIX. SAVING TO THE BUDGET AND TWENTY TWO THREE. REGARDING CASE UNDER SOME WE- UTILIZE MORE RECENT DAY THAN WHAT AVAILABLE THE TIME OF THE COVERS- MANY USERS MOREOVER DATA TO TELL. ASSUMPTIONS FIND THAT THE LIKELY- OVERSTATE CASE JUST OR STILL CABLE GROWTH IN RECENT MONTHS AND IT SEEMS IN ABOUT. WE ALSO HAVE A BUDGET CASE OF WATER AND HAVE ON THE END DATE OF THE CALL HEALTH CONCERN. DUE TO A- FEDERAL. THAT LOOKS. PROHIBITS THE TERMINATE- BALANCE OF FOR MOST PEOPLE. ONCE AT THE PUBLIC OFFERING C. HANDS ON RESTRICTION WOULD GO AWAY AND ELIGIBILITY TERMINATIONS WORK- BEGINNING. AND THEN YOU ARE ALSO DIFFERENT FROM THE MINISTRATION IS ALL DUE TO A CASE OF MIX- DO THE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS AND JUST MENTION WE PROJECTED SLOWER INCREASE IN HIGH COST CASES ARE SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES WHICH RESULTS IN. SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS JUST ARE HIGH RELATIVE COST COMPARED TO OTHER MEDICAID CASELOADS. WHILE WE DO. FIND THAT. THE COST OF CASES CAN BE SINCERE LOWER THAN WHAT THAT INCLUDING THE- I TIME WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING CHANGES. DUE TO CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY IN THESE ESTIMATES AND WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR BUDGET PROCESS. REGARDING THE MCO TAX ON FOR OVER A DECADE THE STATE HAS IMPOSED A TAX ON MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS AND USE REVENUES TO OFFSET GENERAL AND COST OF MEDICAL. TAX GENERATES AN ANNUAL NATIONAL FOR THE BENEFIT OF OVER ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND IS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION INCLUDES FELT CLEAN OF THE STATE OTHERWISE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO DRIVE DOWN. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT PROPOSE TO EXTEND THE MCO TAX INSTEAD WOULD ALLOW TO EXPIRE HALFWAY THROUGH TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE RESULT IN THE LOSS OF ROUGHLY ONE POINT FIVE BILLION GENERAL FUND BENEFIT. ON AN ONGOING BASIS. THE MINISTRY HAS NOTED LIKELY. ARE WHICH IS EXCUSE. IN MEDICAL MANAGED- DATA SCHEDULED REQUIREMENT- COULD HAVE AN IMPACT AS WELL AS AN ANTICIPATED VOLATILITY IN CASE THE CALL- WHICH COULD COMPLICATE THE RENEWAL OF THE MCO TAX. WE AGREE THAT THE SCATTERING BECOMING CULD COST CHALLENGES. BUT WE KNOW THAT THEY WOULD BE TEMPORARY IN NATURE AND BELIEVES THAT THESE CHALLENGES COULD BE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ALL. I SAID THREE RECOMMEND THREE OPTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER. FIRST ELECTRIFICATION WE KNEW THE MCO TAX BASED ON THE EXISTING MODEL. YEAR FOR CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THIS WOULD OVERCOME THE CHALLENGE OF RETIREMENTS AND THE CHANGE IN PLANS IS NOT ANTICIPATED TO GROW UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. TWENTY TWENTY FOR LATER USE THE LEGISLATION WOULD NEED TO CONSIDER WHEN IT WOULD BE. FEASIBLE TO GET INTO ANY TAX. OPTION TWO WOULD BE TO PROVIDE. YEAR WE OFFER. OF THE TAX CODE IN PLACE BEFORE AND AFTER THE RIVER GERMAN. WITH STRESSED IN BY- GOVERNMENT- DRAWING THAT PERIOD. AND A THIRD OPTION WOULD BE TO- THE NCO TOP DID NOT IN YOU AT A LATER. SUCH AS IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. THE STATE HAS A BETTER IDEA WHICH INSTILLS WILL PARTICIPATE IN. MEDICAID MANAGED. CARE IN ONE ROOM AND WILL LOOK LIKE. REGARDING THE- HOW LOCAL SYSTEMS. WE CANNOT CONCERNS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU AND- YEAH APPRECIATE PRESENTATIONS- FEW QUESTIONS ON BOTH OF THESE ITEMS SO FIRST OF ALL I GUESS IN TERMS OF THE MONEY TO SAY FIRST OF ALL- APPRECIATE ELLIE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE MCO TAX- JUST MENTIONS CERTAINLY- MEDIC HAL AS A PLAYER IS A LITTLE YELLOW IN PAIR. WE'VE SPENT YEARS TALKING ABOUT THE LOW PAYMENT RATES FOR MEDIC HAL AND CAUSING ACCESS ISSUES WELL THERE WAS SOME RELIEF WITH PROPERTY SIX NINETY ONE THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR- BACK FILLING SOME OF THE PROPERTY SIX BECAUSE THE BACK OF THE TOBACCO TAXES A DECLINING REVENUE SOURCE WE LIKE THE FACT THAT THE DECLINING REVENUE SOURCE. AT LEAST IF THAT MEANS LESS USE OF TOBACCO NOT. IF IT'S A BECAUSE PEOPLE FOUND WAYS TO. FRAGILE YET- THAT TAX BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO DECREASED USE. THEM TO ATTACK THOSE REPRESENTATIONS MORE STABLE. FUNDING SOURCE AS WELL AS SOMEONE WHO'S HAD TO BE IN THE LEGISLATURE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. AND AND GIVEN THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES. SO FRANKLY- NOTHING ELSE I COULD CERTAINLY SEE THE REVENUE BEING USED TO IMPROVE ACCESS BY RAISING RATES SO THAT. THE TEAM THAT DID THE RATE OF MEDICAL RATES COULD BE THE SAME AS MEDICARE RATES WHICH SO. MANY PROVIDERS WILL STILL TELL YOU STILL WANT A LOWER PAYERS- BUT AT LEAST- IT'S IT TO BE COMPETITIVE THERE SO I'LL JUST PUT A PIN ON THAT- THAT- I'M NOT SURE WHY WE'RE GIVING UP ON THE MEDIC. THE MCO TAX- AND- AND HOPEFULLY NO ONE BEEN SAYS WE CAN'T RAISE RATES BECAUSE THERE'S NO MONEY BECAUSE WE'VE JUST DECIDED TO GIVE UP ONE POINT FIVE BILLION RIGHT THERE- I GUESS THAT THAT. SITE SO IT'S MORE OF A COMMENT OR QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT- I APPRECIATE THE IS THE UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WHICH ON THE POSITIVE SIDE GIVES US A BETTER FEDERAL MATCH. AND THE I WENT TO A NEGATIVE SIDE BUT OF COURSE THE COST SIDE- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO RETAIN THE- PEOPLE. THAT ARE IN TERMS OF CONTINUATION MEDIC COW WHICH IS ACTUALLY A GOOD THING- SO AND THAT THIS- ON THE COST SIDE IT IS A COST BUT I THINK I THINK IT'S A IT IS A GOOD POLICY. SESSION. A PANDEMIC. BUT- IF THE EMERGENCY BECAUSE OF- WHAT DO WE KNOW. HOW MANY. THAT CASE LOAD WHAT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE CURRENT CASELOAD WOULD END UP. NOT QUALIFYING ANYMORE IN THIS RULING TO STERN ESTIMATE FOR THAT- SO HOW MANY PEOPLE MIGHT BE LOSING THE COVERAGE- IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ENDS THE EMERGENCY AND THE- THE REQUIREMENT FOR CONTINUATION. A RECENT RETENTION AND MEDIC HOUSE COOPER- SO WE HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF ANALYTICS IN REGARDS TO THE POTENTIAL UPCOMING UNWINDING OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND THE REDETERMINATION OF WHAT'S CURRENTLY CLOSE TO FOURTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION LIVES IN MEDIC HOW- WORD ANALYZING IT FROM A NUMBER OF WAYS INCLUDING ON HOW MANY OF OUR BENEFICIARIES TYPICALLY GO THROUGH EX PARTE- HISTORICALLY WHICH IS AROUND THIRTY SIX PERCENT. ROCKS SO LOOKING AT WAYS TO INCREASE THAT WITH A NUMBER OF FACTORS TO ENSURE COVERAGE ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS PRIOR TO- AS YOU KNOW KOBE SAID. WE ARE ANTICIPATING THAT ANYWHERE FROM TWO TO THREE MILLION BENEFICIARIES- MAY TRANSITION TO OTHER COVERAGE FOR EXAMPLE THEY COULD BE TRANSITION TO COVERED CALIFORNIA OR WE ALSO KNOW BASED ON TRENDS IN INFORMATION THAT WE ARE SEEING COME IN WITH OTHER HEALTH COVERAGE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE CURRENTLY ON MEDICARE. DO TO THE CONTINUOUS ENROLLMENT REQUIREMENT HAVE ACTUALLY RECEIVED HEALTH INSURANCE FROM THEIR EMPLOYER AS WELL SO THE GOAL FOR US THROUGH THE REDETERMINATION IS JUST COVERAGE WHETHER THAT'S NOT A CAL COVERED CALIFORNIA OUR OTHER EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE THE GOAL IS FOR US TO TRANSITION SOMEONE TO COVERAGE- AND WE ARE DOING EXTENSIVE OUT REACH WITH OTHER STATES TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAYS TO ACHIEVE THAT- INTO INJURE ANYONE WHO NEEDS COVERAGE. STAYS COVERED UP I WOULD NOTE THOUGH THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF MOVEMENT IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND BY THE TIME YOU AND YOUR PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ENDS AND WE RETIREMENT IT WILL PROBABLY BE ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEARS- THE MOVEMENT AROUND THE STATE AT THE LIGHTS AND MEDICAL SIGNIFICANCE WE ARE CURRENTLY BASED ON THE RECENT MAILER THAT WE HAVE DONE TO EVERYONE- SEEING ANYWHERE ROM 7210% OF PEOPLE HAVING A CHANGE OF. ADDRESS WHERE WE NEED UPDATED CONTACT INFORMATION WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING WITH NAVIGATORS AND- OTHERS TO GET THE WORD OUT- AS WELL AS OUR A MANAGED CARE PLAN PARTNERS ARE COUNTY PARTNERS BECAUSE WE NEED UPDATED. CONTACT INFORMATION SO WHEN THE PUBLIC AT THE MARGINS HE DOES A- WE CAN REACH AN- AND SO ARE THE DIPS. IS DOING A LOT OF ABOUT HOW WE DO THIS LARGE COMMUNICATIONS STATEWIDE HOW WE BRING WHAT WE'RE CALLING AMBASSADORS TO THE TABLE TO PARTNER WITH US TO GET THIS OUT. WE HAVE THE- CAN'T TOOL KITS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON MESSAGING AFTER FLYERS AND BANNERS AFTER ALL OF OUR INDIVIDUALS AND SO- HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT IN WHAT WE'RE DOING. FOR THE UNWINDING SENATOR PAT OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT- AND AGAIN I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR GOAL TO THE IDEAS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO UNCOVER ANYBODY WHO I TRY TO. FIND A PATH CONTINUES PATH COVERAGE SO REALIZING THAT IF THEY MIGHT NEED TO BE DISTANT ROLL FROM MEDIC HOW WE WANT DEFINITELY LANHAM IN THE- CONTINUE TO COVER. THROUGH SOME OTHER MEANS- IT. BUT IF YOU HAVE TWO TO THREE MILLION PEOPLE IT'S A COMING OFF MEDIC HOW THE IN AN EMERGENCY BUT HOW HOW WOULD THAT AFFECT FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE CONTRACTS WITH LOCAL HEALTH PLANS YOU HAVE A FEELING FOR MEMBER PER MONTH- RIGHT. ARE SOME SOME FORM THAT. IS THAT GOING TO CAUSE DISRUPTIONS FOR PEOPLE EDICARE CONTRACTS WITH TO DO HEALTHCARE DELIVERY IF YOU YOU KNOW IF WE SENT THAT AND I KNOW YOU. AND ACTUALLY I'M NOT SURE WHAT TIME WOULD WE HAVE TO DESCEND ROLE- THAT WAS OUR GUIDELINES ON THAT YET FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IF THEY LIFT EMERGENCY. THERE IS YES SO ONCE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DECLARES THAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IT'S ENDING FROM A FROM A- YOU KNOW A FUNDING PERSPECTIVE. ON THAT THE END OF THAT MONTH IN WHICH THAT IS DECLARED THE FOLLOWING MONTHLY WOULD HAVE TO START WE DETERMINATIONS- SO LET ME JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE CURRENTLY- IF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ENDED IN. APRIL WHICH IS CURRENTLY FIVE FOR APRIL FIFTEENTH WHICH WE ACTUALLY DON'T THINK IT IS LIKELY BASED ON WHAT WE'RE HEARING RIGHT NOW BUT- IF IT DID. THAT MEANS THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO TRIGGER A REDETERMINATION PROCESS IN MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- WHICH MEANS THAT MEANS PACKETS WOULD BE A START BEING MAILED TO INDIVIDUALS FOR SOMEONE WHO'S- UP FOR RE DETERMINATION. IN JULY. WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM A SIXTY DAY NOTICE- WE WOULD THEN START ALL RE DETERMINATIONS FOR A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD SO BASED ON THEIR NORMAL RENEWAL MONTH WE WILL BE SENDING PACKETS AND STARTING THAT. PROCESS AGAIN- TO IN ORDER TO KIND OF KEEP- THE MONTHS DISTRIBUTED EVENLY ACROSS WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE. A HUGE SPIKES WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS OVER A FULL TWELVE MONTH PERIOD THAT CMS'S GUIDANCE CURRENTLY ALLOWS FOR. WE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN HAVING MULTIPLE BRAINSTORMING SESSIONS WITH CMS AND OTHER STATES. ARE TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST PATHWAYS FORWARD- WE ARE WORKING ON A NUMBER OF REQUESTS. WE CMS TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS EXACTLY RIGHT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE HAVE COVERAGE. ON SO THEY HAVE ACTUALLY GIVEN US FLEXIBILITY EASE OF WHAT WE CAN ASK OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO DO. WE ARE ADVOCATING BROADLY TO THE FCC WHO CURRENTLY HAS REGULATIONS AND RULES AROUND HOW WE CAN DO OUTREACH. TO BENEFICIARIES. FOR THEM UP WHAT'S COME UP. I'M IN ADVOCATING. GIVE US MORE. AS WE DO THE N. Y. SO WE CAN TEXT INDIVIDUAL WE CAN DO OUR REACHED INTO THE- TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE AWARE. OF THESE PIECES AND SO WE WILL BE- DRAFT WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DROPPING AND WE WILL BE RELEASING A WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATING IN MARCH- AND EXTERNAL DOCUMENTS YOU. INFORM PEOPLE OF WHAT OUR UNWINDING PLAN FOR REDETERMINATION SPECIFICALLY WILL BE AND SO. I ONCE WE HAVE THAT FINAL HAPPY TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ALL RECEIVED COPIES OF THAT AND BRIEF YOU IN ANY WAY NECESSARY TO HELP US ACHIEVE WHAT WE CAN'T YOU. LOSES ANY LIVES AS POSSIBLE BUT YET WE MANAGED CARE PLANS WE HAVE WE ARE ANTICIPATING IT WE'RE USING ARE QUITE CASELOAD PROJECTIONS AND POOR. WHITE BUILDING PURPOSES. WE HAVE TO ANTICIPATE DROPS IN COVERAGE OVER THE- THE NEXT DAY YOU KNOW EIGHTEEN MONTHS DEPENDING ON WHEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ENDS. UP AND WE WILL BE MONITORING THAT VERY CLOSELY. OKAY YEAH I MEAN I THINK IT AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE FOCUS AND THE MOST IMPORTANT AS SOME PATIENTS ARE THE BENEFICIARIES. BUT ALSO I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT THE- YOU KNOW. THE PLANS AND THERE IS A RENT AND HAVING SUCH A WALL WELL IT'S A SUDDEN DROP IN REVENUE BUT IT DECLINED REVENUE DURING THE- CONTRACT TIME RIGHT BECAUSE- IT DO POPULATIONS DECREASED RIGHT. NOW AND- AND BE SURE THAT- WE DO BECAUSE OF THAT WE DON'T SEE EITHER DISRUPTIONS IN SERVICES OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS- AND THAT THEY'RE PLANNING FOR A- POTENTIAL DECLINE. YOU KNOW THE CLIENT AND REVENUE ESSENTIALLY RIGHT- THAT- WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN- BUT- THAT. CAN BE ANTICIPATED. AT SOME POINT IT WILL HAPPEN CORRECT. I AGREE THAT'S WHY WANTING TO MANAGED CARE PLANS TO BE OF OUR BIG. PART AS MOVE. WITH THIS PLAN BECAUSE THEY HAVE A LOT AT STAKE RIGHT IN REGARDS TO MAKING SURE ANYONE WHO NEEDS TO STAY IN MEDIC HAL. IS BEING RE DETERMINED AND- AND CAN'T CONTINUE THAT COVERAGE WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE CHARMER PEOPLE DROP OFF. FOR QUITE A FEW MONTHS AND COME BACK ON IT IS VERY DESTRUCTIVE FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND BROTHERS AND SO. THEY WILL BE A KEY PARTNER AS WE ROLL OUT OUR UPCOMING TOOL KITS- AND BUILD OUR COALITION FOR WHAT WILL. BE BEFORE US IN TWENTY TWO AND TWENTY THREE. OKAY AND THEN THE OTHER THAT'S ACTUALLY THE ONLY. ISSUE NUMBER THREE I GUESS THAT'S ABOUT CCS PROGRAM SO I UNDERSTAND FROM WHAT YOU SAID BECAUSE WE SEE A- PROJECTED TO. DECREASE IN THE MEDIC HOW CASELOAD. INCREASE IN THE STATE ONLY THAT THAT'S PERHAPS IT SHIFTS. BECAUSE OF THE- THAT MAY HAPPEN- MOTHER BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUOUS ENROLLMENT OR OTHER OTHER REASONS AS WELL. BUT I GUESS- ONE OF THE THINGS I WANNA JUST MENTIONED SO I KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT CCS COVERS IS FOR EXAMPLE NICKI STAYS. FOR PREMATURE INFANTS- WE KNOW THAT- FORTUNATELY UNVACCINATED- PREGNANT WOMEN ARE THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO DELIVER PREMATURELY IF THEY GETS COVETED AND THEN ONCE THAT AREN'T- ARE WE ANTICIPATING AN INCREASE POTENTIALLY OF. THANK YOU- BABIES- BECAUSE BECAUSE OF THIS IF WE DON'T GET INCREASE OUR RATES OF VACCINATION AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN. THAT WOULD BE COVERED BY CCS. BUT I HAVE NOT HAD ANY REPORTS OF AN INCREASE IN THE QUEUE STATES WE CAN DEFINITELY RUN ANALYTICS IF IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE PROBABLY SEEN IT BY NOW ARE GIVEN THE LONGEVITY OF THE- EMERGENCY BUT LET ME TOUCH BASE WITH THE TEAM WE CAN RUN SOME NUMBERS AND SEE IF WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE. OF OUR TREND INCREASE YEAR OVER YEAR WITH NICK YOU STAYS BASED ON NUMBER OF PEOPLE ENROLLED IN OUR MEDICARE CCS OR STATE ONLY CCS WILL DO IT ACROSS SO IT'S FULLY ACROSS THE BOARD WILL HAVE TO RUN SOME NUMBERS YEAH AND IT'S POSSIBLE YOU MAY NOT SEE IT E. L. F. I MEAN PANDEMICS ONLY BEEN AROUND FOR TWO YEARS. BUT SINCE I ONLY FEEL LIKE FOREVER BUT- THE OTHER THING ABOUT PREGNANCY LENGTH OF PREGNANCY IT'S ADDRESS IT MAY JUST START BEATON'S MEETS TO START SHOWING UP AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUE- AND THEN IN TERMS OF- C. C. S. C. C. S. ITSELF- IN TERMS OF THE PROVIDER NETWORK. ARE THERE ANY CONCERNS. CAN IN TERMS OF- A PAYMENT- TO- THE- WE HAD WE HAD A SHOW. OF SINCE. HE AFFECTS OF SPECIAL. AND PEOPLE RETIRING AND SO FORTH IT IS THERE IS THAT IS THERE ANY ISSUE THERE WHEN IT COMES TO ACCESS TO THE PEDIATRIC SUB SPECIALISTS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WELL WE HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD SHORTAGES IN CERTAIN PEDIATRIC SUBSPECIALISTS AS I'M SURE YOU'RE VERY AWARE- GIVEN THE ROLE YOU PLAY IN MEDICARE AS WELL. SO WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING AT PEDIATRIC SUBSPECIALISTS SHORTAGES THERE ARE CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE WHERE WE HAVE CLEAR- PBX YOUR- SPECIAL SHORTAGES- OFTEN TIMES- MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE TO. SEND BENEFICIARIES TOO YOU KNOW AND PAY FOR THEM TO TRAVEL DISTANCES TO GET TO A CERTAIN SPECIALS TELEHEALTH HAS BEEN GREAT A GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN REGARDS TO THAT BEING ABLE TO CONNECT WITH PEOPLE VIA TELEHEALTH AND- MAXIMIZING THAT TO THE DEGREE WE CAN'T SO. WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT NETWORK ADEQUACY BROADLY ACROSS ALL AREAS BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN OUR CHILDREN- YOU KNOW SUBSPECIALTIES THAT OUR CHALLENGE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN WAY BEYOND THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY JUST TO BE CLEAR- AND WHAT WE'LL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT. AND THAT'S ACROSS ALL PAYERS NOT NOT JUST MEDIC OUT ALSO. YES IT'S. CERTAINLY IT- BUT I THINK IT GIVEN THE FACT THAT MEDICARE COVERS. OF ALL TO. AND OF COURSE YES PLEASE I THINK THIS. BOWLS OF HAIR FOR. FEARS OF SPECIALISTS- THEN- THEY GET CCS THE SURPRISED THE MARKET AND- SO IF CCS ISN'T ABLE TO PROVIDE ENOUGH SUPPORT- AD YOU KNOW DOES COMMERCIAL ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH. THEN WE END UP WITH SHORTAGES SO LOOK FOR TO SEE IT TO CONTINUE DISCUSSION ABOUT. HOW WE CAN TRY TO BOLSTER OUR- PEER SYSTEM SPECIALTY WORK FORCE. HERE IN CITY CALIFORNIA SURE OUR CHILDREN CCS. CAN GET CONTINUED ACCESS OF THANK YOU. THANK VERY MUCH- LET US MOVE ON TO CAROLINE ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. I WILL I WILL SIMON COOPER YOU. ALSO AS AS YOU ALL KNOW- YOU KNOW KATHLEEN IS REALLY A GOAL OF MOVING TOWARDS A MORE POPULATION HEALTH APPROACH WHERE WE PRIORITIZE BOTH PREVENTION AND WHOLE PERSON CARE SERVICES A REALLY MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE MEETING PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE IN LIFE- IT'S REALLY AROUND BREAKING DOWN THE WALLS OF HEALTH CARE- AND REALLY- COORDINATING ACROSS THOSE SOCIAL DRIVERS OF HEALTH I'M MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING ALL THE NEEDS OF AN INDIVIDUAL PHYSICAL BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENTAL DENTAL LONG TERM CARE NEEDS- AND SO WE WERE VERY EXCITED TO SEE THE ANNOUNCEMENT- AND APPROVAL OF THE BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND I'LL KIND OF WALK THROUGH BASED ON YOUR REQUEST IN THE AGENDA. SOME KEY UPDATES IN REGARDS TO THE PROGRAM I DH CS HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTING ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT- AND WE ARE DOING THAT IN PHASES AS YOU KNOW I WAS SO EASY AND DID GO LIVE JANUARY ONE IN TWENTY FIVE COUNTY UNDER TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES ARE THOSE THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY SERVING WHOLE PERSON CARE AND HELP COMES MEMBERS APPROXIMATELY NINETY FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WERE- TRANSITIONS TO ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT- AND ARE CURRENTLY RECEIVING SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE THAT NUMBER IS INCREASING ITS MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THEIR- PROVIDER NETWORKS CONTINUE TO ENROLL- INDIVIDUALS INTO THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THE NEXT IMPLEMENTATION DATE WILL BE JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- WHERE ADDITIONAL POPULATIONS OF FOCUS WILL BE ADDED- MAINLY IN COUNTIES THAT DIDN'T HAVE A WHOLE PERSON CARE OR HELP COMES IN- THOSE EXISTING TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES WHERE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT POPULATION OF FOCUS IN THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT FOR HEALTH PROBLEMS- THOSE POPULATIONS INCLUDE- INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS- HI UTILIZE ERRORS- SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS OR A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. NEEDS IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE WE WILL ALSO EXPAND YOU OF POPULATIONS. OF FOCUS WHERE WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT INDIVIDUALS TRANSITIONING FROM OUR- TO THE COMMUTER. AS WELL AS MA'AM. HAT ARE ALLEGED FOR LAW TERM CARE ACCURATE IT IS NURSING HOMES WANTED TO TRANSITION TO THE COMMUNITY. AND THEN IN JULY TWENTY THREE- EXTENDING EXPANDING TO OUR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. WE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FROM ADVOCATES THAT THEY WANTED MORE TIME TO BUILD UP THE ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT- A PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND SO WE HAVE. A DEDICATED GROUP WORKING ON THAT SPECIFICALLY TO MAKE SURE WE GET THAT RIGHT IT'S COMPLEX WITH CCS AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH CHILDREN ADVOCATES TO BUILD THAT WITH THEM- ADDITIONALLY DH CS ADOPTED A LIST OF FOURTEEN COMMUNITY SUPPORTS AS WE HAVE REPORTED TO THIS. COMMITTEE PREVIOUSLY- SO SOME UPDATES IN REGARDS TO WHAT WHAT LIVE IN AND WHAT WE'RE ANTICIPATING. IN JANUARY TWENTY FIVE MANAGED CARE PLANS IN FORTY SEVEN COUNTIES BEGAN OFFERING UP MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY TRAINEES SUPPORT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A REALLY HAPPY TO SEE THAT BROAD I TAKE UP IN JANUARY- APPROXIMATELY FORTY THOUSAND MEMBERS. AS SMOOTHLY TRANSITIONED ON JANUARY ONE TO A COMMUNITY'S COURTS FROM OUR WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS- IN AGAIN I'VE SEEN THE INCREASE ADDS. THE WEEKS GO BY ABSENT THAT GO LIVE. ADDITIONALLY AS JIMMY SUPPORTS OUR VOLUNTARY- FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO OFFER A BUT THEY HAVE ISSUED IN LET US KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GONNA BRING UP IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS CURRENTLY THEY HAVE. THE ABILITY TO UPDATE THAT LIST- BUT WE DO KNOW THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS WILL BE BRINGING THOSE UP TO WHAT WE CURRENTLY SEE IT ON AVERAGE. MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE ELECTED TO INITIALLY FOCUS THEIR OFFERINGS ON NO FIVE TO SIX VARIOUS COMMUNITY SUPPORTS ARE WE PROVIDING CLEAR THESE ARE BIG LARGE THINGS FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO PICK UP AND TO BUILD. A LOT OF NEW CONTRACTS AND SO- PHASING A MAN IS APPROPRIATE- AND WE SUPPORT THAT- YOU KNOW ADDITIONALLY WE'RE SEEING MOST PLANS INITIALLY STARTED WITH. THE HOUSING RELATED SERVICES THAT NAVIGATION SERVICES LIAISON SERVICES. DEPOSITS A MEDICALLY TAILORED ME SALES AND AS MY ROOMIE- AND THEN THROUGHOUT THREE AND TWENTY. YEAR TO SEE. PLANS TO CHECK TO UP THOSE COMMUNITY SUPPORT OF. AS ONCE TERM KERR IS GARBAGE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND TWENTY THREE WE SEE A SUITE OF THE- COMMUNITY SUPPORTS THAT REALLY LINE UP WITH LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. I REALLY COMING OFF ONLINE AT THAT TIME. I WOULD JUST KNOW DHS HAS POSTED A LIST OF ALL COMMUNITY SUPPORT BY MANAGED CARE PLAN ACCOUNT ON OUR WEBSITE- SO THERE'S FULL DISCLOSURE TO EVERYONE IN REGARDS TO WHAT WE ARE SEEING ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN REGARDS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PAYMENT REFORM- WE ARE CURRENTLY ON SCHEDULE TO IMPLEMENT JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND THERE'S THREE MAIN KIND OF INITIATIVES AROUND PAYMENT FOR MANY OF THESE THINGS WILL BE MOVING THIS YEAR. THERE'S THE TRANSITION TO NEW CODING FOR OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COLLEAGUES- WE ARE ALSO. DEVELOPING THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL TRANSFER PROCESS WHETHER COUNTY PARTNERS AND THEN OF COURSE THE LARGEST CHANGES THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW FEE SCHEDULE. AND THIS WILL BE A CROSSBOW SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ACROSS. ALL OF OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE. YOU BECAUSE BASED AS THAT IS BIG OUR- ADDITIONALLY- REGARDING OTHER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REFORM UPDATES IN CALAIS. I DH CS ISSUED GUIDANCE- TO UPDATE CRITERIA FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES I'M IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THE GUIDANCE REALLY JUST CLARIFIES THAT SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES CAN BE PROVIDED DURING THE ASSESSMENT PERIOD. INCLUDING BEFORE A DIAGNOSIS IS MADE ON THIS IT'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT FOR OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COLLEAGUES. ADDITIONALLY IT ESTABLISHES A CEREBRAL CRITERIA FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE. OUGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS- YOU KNOW A CLEAN ACCESS LINE FOR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. ESPECIALLY FOR HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS. THAT REALLY NEED SERVICES OR HAVE EXPERIENCED YOU KNOW EXTENSIVE TRAUMA IN THEIR LIVES MAKING SURE THEY HAVE EARLY AND FAST ACCESS TO. A HIGHER LEVEL OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. WE ARE ALSO WORKING TO IMPLEMENT DOCUMENT EDIT SORRY DOCUMENTATION OR FORM- WHICH WILL GO LIVE IN JULY OF THIS YEAR REALLY STREAMLINING AND STANDARDIZING THE CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS ACROSS BOTH SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH. DRUG MEDI CAL AND- DMC ODS PROVIDERS A LONG TIME COMING AND REALLY CRITICAL EYE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON OUR PROVIDERS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- AND RETAIN THAT WORKFORCE. SO CRITICAL FOR US ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE LAST ITEM THAT WE ARE ALSO GROWING OUT IN JULY OF THIS YEAR IS NO WRONG DOOR POLICY. ALSO IN THE INDIVIDUALS REALLY HAVE ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WHICH ARE REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY INITIALLY STARTED THOSE SERVICES- AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE TRANSITIONS SMOOTHLY- WHEN THEY START. ON THE- COUNTY SIDE BUT IT REALLY SHOULD BE MANAGED CARE PLAN- OR VICE VERSA SO E'RE REALLY WORKING ON. THAT ACROSS THE BOARD WITH MANAGED CARE AND OUR COUNTY PARTNERS- IN REGARDS TO SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES ARE PLANNING AROUND THE CARBON OF LONG TERM CARE BENEFITS- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY. WITH STAKE HOLDERS- I'VE MANAGED. CARE PLANS THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL SOCIO ASIAN DEVELOPMENT SERVICE PROVIDE JUST AGEE. OTHER PARTNERS- AND WORKGROUP REALLY HAS THANK YOU. TO HELP IN THE OVERALL- AND HOW WE SHOULD APPROACH THIS INCLUDING A PROVIDER FEEDBACK ON MEMBER COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY COMMUNICATIONS CONTRACT LANGUAGE- DATA SHARING OTHERS BEEN A NUMBER OF. CONVERSATIONS AND YOUR CONTINUING THOSE CONVERSATIONS IN EARNEST I'M HOPING TO HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT WORKGROUP BY MAY THAT WILL REALLY HELP US FINALISE POLICIES YOU GET. THAT GUIDANCE OUT TO OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS IN ANTICIPATION OF THAT CARBON- WE ALSO HAVE CONVENED A SUB WORKGROUP. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES HOW TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC TRANSITIONS FOR THE- INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES THAT. ARE UNIQUE POPULATION WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING THERE TO YOU I'D TAKE IT TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS OF THAT GROUP AND SO. YOU'VE BEEN GAUGING IT AND THAT. ARE ON THE MANAGED CARE PLAN INCENTIVES- YOU KNOW THE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A GAP FILLING PLAN IN A NEEDS ASSESSMENT I BET THAT WAS DUE TO US IN JANUARY- WE ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT THAT THE PRIORITY AREAS. OF THAT NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND GAP FILLING PLANT WAS AROUND DELIVERY SYSTEM INFRASTRUCTURE. ECM PROVIDER CAPACITY BUILDING AS WELL AS COMMUNITY SUPPORT. CAPACITY BUILDING AS WELL AS THE TAKE UP OF THOSE COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND SO ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR MANAGED CARE PLAN PARTNERS- THEY DO RECEIVE. SOME FUNDING IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR BASED ON THE FILINGS OF THOSE GAPS- PLANS AND NEEDS ASSESSMENTS AND THEN THEY WILL BE REQUIRED TO. MEET VARIOUS PERFORMANCE METRICS OVER THE REST OF THE CALENDAR YEAR ON THE NEXT PAYMENT DATE WHICH WOULD BE SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR. I'M CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEIR MEDICARE PLANS TO SEE WHAT THE PROGRAM YOU'RE TOO AND PROGRAM YOUR THREE REQUIREMENTS METRICS WOULD BE. OF COURSE ALIGNING WITH THE NEXT PHASES OF CAL LANE FOR EXAMPLE THE CARVING AND OF LONG TERM CARE. OF AND OTHER KIND OF HEAT- YOU KNOW POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT APPROACHES THERE AS WE CONTINUE TO KIND. OF DIG IN ON THAT FRONT. ON THE OTHER P. IS. ASKED TO DO KIND OF WHAT THROUGH HOW. CAN HOW CERTAIN OF POP. IN VULNERABLE- YOU KNOW. EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS JUSTICE- AND LONG TERM CARE SO JUST A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THAT. NO REALLY AT THE END OF THE DAY- WE HAVE PROVIDED A SUITE OF SERVICES FOR SOMEONE WHO IS EXPERIENCING OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. ON THE ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT BENEFITS REALLY ALLOWS FOR- OUTSIDE THE FOUR WALLS IT'S INTENDED TO BE A STREET BASED INITIATIVE. OF WHERE SOMEONE IS MEETING PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE THAT'S NOT A CLINIC IT BASED ON A PIECE OF COURSE A LOT OF OUR ECM PROVIDERS HAVE BOTH WHICH IS GREAT- AND WE'RE SEEING MORE AND MORE STREET MEDICINE PROVIDERS- EAGER AND WILLING TO WORK WITH. US IN MANAGED CARE PLANS TO YOU TO REPEAT I JUMP IN- AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SERVICES. ALSO THERE'S A SUITE OF COMMUNITY SUPPORTS YOU HAVE- NAVIGATION SERVICES- HOUSING DEPOSITS LIAISON SERVICES SO WHEN SOMEONE GETS HOUSE WE CAN KEEP THEM HOUSED- OFTEN A VERY YOU KNOW. LONG TRANSITION FOR INDIVIDUALS BUT WE ALSO ARE COVERING WE COULD PREDICT CARE SERVICES OR WHAT SOME CALL HIS MEDICAL RESPITE. AND SHORT TERM POST HOSPITALIZATION SO IF YOU HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL DOES THAT YOU KNOW IT MADE IT TO A HOSPITAL. ARE THAT NEED TO BE DISCHARGED- OFTEN TIMES THEY CAN LANGUISH IN AN INPATIENT BED. WHICH IS A BED THAT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR SOMEONE ELSE IF THEY HAD SOMEWHERE TO DISCHARGE TO YOU. NOW WE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A FULL CONTINUUM OF SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. SO THEY CAN TRANSITION INTO MEDICAL RESPITE OR SHORT TERM POST HOSPITALIZATION WITH THE GOAL OF HOPEFULLY WRAPPING AROUND THE ECM SERVICES ROUNDED INDIVIDUAL. CONNECTING THEM WITH HOUSING IN REALLY FOCUSING ON CONNECTING THEM WITH WHATEVER NEEDS THEY NEED WHETHER THAT'S BEHAVIOR HEALTH NEEDS. THEIR DIABETES GETTING UNDER CONTROL AND COMPLIANCE A NUMBER OF THINGS AND SO- ROBUST PACKAGE TO HELP INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. REALLY WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT DSS AND OTHER- YOU KNOW IN REGARDS TO THE HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES- WELL THIS FALL ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR JUSTICE INVOLVED. INDIVIDUALS AS YOU KNOW- THE PROPOSED IN THE BY. A ROBUST JUST PACKAGE WE ARE STILL. THAT WAS. BUT IT'S- WHAT IT WOULD DO PROVIDE. IN REACHED. BY SOMEONE'S IN. THAT PRISON JAIL OR G. FACILITY LAW. TO COVER OVER. OF SERVICES AND BENEFITS. OF WHILE THEY ARE INCARCERATED AND YOU HAVE A COORDINATED REENTRY INTO THE COMMUNITY- WE HAVE EXTENSIVE DATA THAT DEMONSTRATES THAT SHOWS. THAT THIS WILL REDUCE- NOT ONLY EMERGENCY ROOM AND INPATIENT DAYS UPON RELEASE INTO THE COMMUNITY. IF WE CAN ONNECT THEM TO THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS SO THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING RELEASED FROM JAIL INTO HOMELESSNESS. CONNECT THOSE DOTS ARE WE REALLY FEEL LIKE WE CAN IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE- JUSTICE INVOLVED. IN CONNECTING THEM TO IT A NETWORK OF INDIVIDUALS THAT EITHER HAVE. EXPERIENCE AT YOUR PEERS THAT ARE JUST AS INVOLVED IN OTHERS AND SO WE ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT. OUR JUSTICE INVOLVED PACKAGE THAT WE ARE WORKING ON DILIGENTLY WITH CMS. AND THEN LASTLY THE INDIVIDUALS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES A VARIETY OF THE THINGS THAT ENDD UP IN COMMUNITY SUPPORTS REALLY ARE THINGS THAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY SEE IN A NINETEEN FIFTEEN C. WAIVER. FOR SOME OF OUR OTHER H. C. B. S. SERVICES. IN MAKING SURE THAT THOSE ARE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE BOTH FROM A PREVENTATIVE POINT OF VIEW OR IF THEY'RE IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AND WANT TO TRANSITION. TO THE COMMUNITY AND CAN SAFELY RESIDE IN THE COMMUNITY BUT PROP SERVICES. MAKING SURE WE MAKE THOSE AVAILABLE FOR INDIVIDUALS AND BY CARVING LONG TERM CARE INTO THE MANAGED CARE PLAN AND THEN GIVING THEM THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT. THEY REALLY HAVE ALL THE TOOLS AT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE SURE SOMEBODY IS RICK YOU KNOW ABLE TO RESIDE SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY EITHER PREVENTING THAT SKILLED NURSING FACILITY STAY. OR TRANSITIONING AMMONS OR REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THAT PACKAGE COME TOGETHER. TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE EXPANDING LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE LAST THING I MENTIONED BEFORE OF COURSE CLOSE AND OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS. WE ALSO HAVE IN TELLING A PAST FUNDING OF PROVIDING ACCESS IN TRANSFORMING HEALTH DOLLARS. REALLY THESE ARE DOLLARS THAT WERE APPROVED. BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ONE POINT FOUR BILLION AHLERS YOU GET DOLLARS DIRECTLY TO. WE KNOW THE IT IS A IMPORTS NEWS SERVICE ACROSS STATE A. K. WHICH PROVIDERS HISTORIC HAVE NOT BEEN. MEDICAL PROVIDERS THEY HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO BUILD AND DO THINGS SO. THE PATH PROVIDE A DOLLARS PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO. THOSE PROVIDERS THAT PROVIDE COLLABORATION DOLLARS LOCALLY TO CONVENE AND DISCUSS. IT ALSO. INCLUDES DIRECT GRANTS FOR PROVIDERS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE BUILDING FOR WORKFORCE EXPANSION. OF FOR TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT. AS WELL AS I. T. SYSTEM CHANGES THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT CAN BILL MEDICARE HOW. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PROVIDERS DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THAT RISK. BECAUSE THAT IS HARD FOR SOME SMALL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO DO. AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH PEOPLE AS WE ROLL THAT OUT IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO AS WELL. SO THAT IS THAT CONCLUSION MY CONSTANT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT FINANCE. I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD THANK YOU HELLO. THANK YOU SENATOR ADMIN- KOREA SHEET WITH THE US LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- ON THIS ISSUE AND WE JUST MAKE A VERY BRIEF COMMENT AND JUST RAISE THAT THERE'S A BEAR REALLY MAJOR PORTION OF- CATALANES SPECIFICALLY. A PORTION OF FUNDING TO SUPPORT. D. PROVIDING ACCESS IN TRANSFORMING HEALTH OR PATH PROGRAM WHICH GENERALLY. HAS THE ADMINISTRATION JUST NOTED PROVIDES FUNDING TO PROVIDERS COUNTIES AND CEOS TO ENSURE A SMOOTH TRANSITION TO. THE VARIOUS KALYAN COMPONENTS WHICH ADMINISTRATION ASSUMES WILL BE SUPPORTED BY FEDERAL FUNDS OF ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS- HOWEVER WE UNDERSTAND THAT FEDERAL APPROVAL FOR THIS- TO ACCESS SORT OF THIS THIS FEDERAL FUNDING REMAINS. PENDING ALTERNATELY IF FEDERAL APPROVALS NOT RECEIVED ACCESS FEDERAL FUNDINGFOR THIS COMPONENT THAT ALTERNATE FUNDING WOULD NEED TO BE- PROVIDED SUPPORT SERVICE. COMPONENTS OF THE PATH INITIATIVE THAT THAT WE JUST MENTIONED. SO THOSE ARE OTHER COMMENTS AT THIS TIME AND WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE. FURTHER ASSISTANCE WHERE NEEDED. THANK YOU MUCH AND THINK YOU. MISS COOPER FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE ON THIS I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE. REALLY PUT YOUR HEART AND SOUL INTO THIS AND WE ALL HAVE A LOT OF HOPE. AND EXPECTATIONS I GUESS WRITING ON THIS. FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF HEALTH FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS- HOW CAN YOU TELL TALK TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT SO WE'RE DOING FORTY THOUSAND ENROLLED NOW AND- REMIND ME WHAT'S THE WHOLE NUMBER THAT WE THINK. ACROSS THE STATE THAT WILL GET TO AT SOME POINT AND ROLLED AND CAROLINE. SO THE TICKET WERE FORTY THOUSAND FOR COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND WE'RE NINETY FIVE THOUSAND FOR ENHANCED YOUR MANAGEMENT SO- YOU KNOW PRETTY GOOD. PICK UP FOR THE TRANSITION- YOU KNOW WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE WE HAVE A YOU KNOW A SCALE WHERE WE DO THINK THAT THAT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE BUT IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. A PERSON CARE IN HEALTH TERMS WITHIN SOME OF OUR LARGEST POPULATED COUNTIES- IT WAS LIVE IN LOS ANGELES IT WAS LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO- I EITHER REALLY LARGER AREAS WHERE THE POPULATION IS. IS PRETTY HIGH WE STILL ANTICIPATE A DOUBLING OF THE AT. LEAST OF THOSE ERVICES. WE DO THINK ANYWHERE FROM YOU KNOW ONE TO YOU YOU KNOW THREE OR EVEN SOMETIMES 5% DEPENDING ON THE POPULATION OF FOCUS. I WILL- COME INTO THE PROGRAM BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN SOME DOESN'T STAY ON THAT. IN THOSE SERVICES FOREVER IT DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF SERVICE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING. FOR EXAMPLE A HOME MODIFICATION IS A ONE TIME YOU KNOW ODD YOU KNOW BENEFIT FOR SOMEBODY- TO RECEIVE- IT'S NOT LIKE THEY WOULD BE ON GOING RECEIVING THOSE SERVICES AND SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT WE HAVE. STANDARDIZED REPORTING TO LOOK AT UTILIZATION TRENDS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL BE BREAKING THAT DOWN BY RACE ETHNICITY LANGUAGE ETCETERA- AND- AS A DATA ROLLS AND WE'RE ANTICIPATING. ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THIS YEAR WILL BE ABLE TO START POSTING A DASHBOARD FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE TRACKING. OUR INVOLVEMENT NUMBERS IN THE PROGRAM. OKAY AT CERTAIN WE'RE AFFECTED SO WE HAVE THOSE THOSE. VETTEL PERSON CARE IN A LOT OF THOSE KIND BUT WE WERE PROVIDING THE REIMBURSEMENT FOR ALL A LOT OF THEM TO GO ALONG WITH THAT. SO HOW HAVE THE CAR HAS HOW IS THE COST OF. THE COUNTIES NOW. TWITTER ACCOUNT HAS BEEN ABLE TO ACTUALLY CONTRACT. THE SUPPORT SERVICES THAT WE NEED IN THIS NEXT PHASE ESPECIALLY AS IT RELATES TO HOUSING. YES THE HOUSING IS ONE OF THE- TWENTY SUPPORT THATHAS THE LARGEST PICKUP SO MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY BEEN ABLE TO BUT I THINK IT WAS ALL THE WAY TO THE END JUST TO BE CLEAR AND SOME ARE PROBABLY CONTRACTS ARE STILL GOING TO COURT FOR FINAL. SIGN OFF- YOU KNOW HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXECUTE THOSE CONTRACTS WITH COMPANIES WITH PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEMS WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND THAT'S JUST WHAT WAS TRANSITIONING OVER WE DO KNOW THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE INCREASED OUR PROVIDERS- PARTICIPATE IN COMMUNITY SUPPORT- AND WE KNOW MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE WORKING VERY ACTIVELY WITH INDIVIDUALS TO FINALIZED OR BRING ON NEW PROVIDERS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO INCREASING THAT NETWORK OVER TIME- BUT- THESE ARE NEW RELATIONSHIPS AND SO WE DO KNOW THAT. AND TRY TO SET THE EXPECTATION THAT IT WILL TAKE TIME TO BUILD THIS UP ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HAPPY TO SEND YOU A LIST OF FOR EXAMPLE ALL THE HOUSING- PIECES THAT WE HAVE MANY COUNTIES ARE ARE PROVIDING HOUSING RELATED SERVICES- AND SO WE ANTICIPATE THOSE NUMBERS TO INCREASE. PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE COMING MONTHS. AND IT IS L. A. WAS POINT ABOUT- THIS IS STILL PENDING NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE PAST FUNNY THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- SO IF THAT DOESN'T COME THROUGH AND SOME AND MY QUESTION IS REALLY JUST- AROUND BILLING. RATE WE'RE GOING TO REDO THE BILLING IT SOUNDS LIKE FOR CAL AIM BUT IS THAT GOING TO BE FOR MEDICAL AS A- AS A WHOLE. THE WE'RE GONNA REDO THE BILLING OR JUST FOR THE KILLING SECTION. TO CLARIFY HERE SO I'D SEE MASTERS BELIEVE PROVED THAT UNITY SUPPORTS AND ALL OF THE- SERVICES. THAT IS BUILT INTO THE CAPITATION RATE WE HAVE THE- THE FUNDING FOR THAT THE BUDGET THAT'S FULLY APPROVED AND NO ISSUES THERE- WHEN IT COMES TO PASS. BMS HAS ALSO APPROVED PATH AS THE FEDERAL BUT DRAW DOWN SO THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED IT'S CURRENTLY APPROVED IN OUR LEVIN FIFTEEN WAIVER. FOR THE PATHFINDER. THE PEACE THAT THE ALLEY- WAS MENTIONING IS THE NON FEDERAL SHARE. CALIFORNIA HAD PUT A PROPOSAL FORWARD TO USE WHAT'S CALLED DISH BEATS VERY TECHNICAL TERM. BUT IT'S WHERE WE ACTUALLY USE ADDITIONAL. FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL SIDE. TO COVER THE NON FEDERAL SHARE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE STILL NEGOTIATING SO IT'S JUST- THE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE COMMITTED FOR PATH. WE'RE TRYING TO NEGOTIATE THE NON FEDERAL SHINES. FUNDS OF USING DISH BE. TECHNICAL SO WE'LL GET INTO IT TOO MUCH. AND IF THEY ARE CORRECT CMS DID NOT APPROVE THAT PART OF THE PEACE WERE CONTINUING THOSE NEGOTIATIONS. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR IT CLOSELY BUT IF FOR SOME REASON. IT WAS DENIED IN THE FUTURE WE WOULD HAVE TO THEN. REPLACE IT WITH SOMETHING FOR THAT NON FEDERAL SHARE FOR THOSE. FOR THOSE PATH AHLERS BUT- THERE HAS BEEN- A GENERAL FUND COMMITTED FOR PATH IN THE BUDGET. CURRENTLY FOR BOTH THE JUSTICE INVOLVED PATH PART. AS WELL AS- IN OUR HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES PLANNED THERE'S A PORTION OF FUNDS. DEDICATED TO PAP AS WELL ALREADY FROM THE GENERAL FUND AND SO WE HAVE SOME. LEEWAY. AND YOU'RE WATCHING THIS VERY CLOSELY. DO YOU. HOPEFUL IF YOU ARE COUPLE YEARS- YOU'RE- I DIDN'T SOME BY YOU KNOW GETTING COMMUNITY. THE BY THE MAZE. I DIDN'T PAY THAT FOR WAS- THE DISHMAN PARTS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE. IT'S BEEN A IT'S SOMETHING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS STRUGGLED WITH- CONTINUING FOR A WHILE BUT- WE HAVE A GOOD ARGUMENT THAT YOU'RE REALLY CRITICAL PAYMENTS IT'S FOCUSED ON EQUITY IN IT. THE ADMINISTRATION IS BURIED YOU KNOW. A CLEARLY WANTING TO CLOSE EQUITY GAPS WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THEM TO CONTINUE LOOKING AT OUR DISH BECAUSE LAW AND WILL CONTINUE TO STRESS THAT THE CMS. THANK YOU CLICK TO PRINT. THANK YOU AND FIRST MONTHS CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING THE WAIVERS- I KNOW THAT WAS A LOT OF WORK AND PERSUASION HALFPENNY I DO APPRECIATE CMS SEEING THE WISDOM OF APPROVING THESE WAIVERS- AND LETTING US MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS VERY IMPORTANT. INITIATIVE CAL AIM SO CAN THANK YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS ON THAT- DID HAVE SOME QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW IMPLEMENTATIONS WERE NOW ROLLING THE IMPLEMENTATION USED TO BE SPENT ON TIME YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PLANNING AND SO FORTH. SO ON THE END HENCE CARE MANAGEMENT I THINK YOU MENTIONED- YOU KNOW CURRENTLY GOT NINETY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THERE WE HAVE A STILL SORT OF GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO COULD QUALIFY- SO IS ANYONE WHO FITS INTO THOSE CATEGORIES QUALIFY FOR BEHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT OR- IS THE NUMBER CAST. AT SOME POINT- IS SO IS IT A TITLE MEANT OPEN IT OUT SO BASICALLY IT'S WHOEVER NEEDS IT. WHO FITS THE CATEGORIES. QUALIFICATIONS THAT SET OUT WE'LL GET IT OR IS IT LIKE- WELL ACTUALLY- ME TO CAP OUT A CERTAIN POINT AND THEN EVEN IF YOU QUALIFY WELL YOU EITHER HAVE TO WAIT OR- WHATEVER SO. SO IT'S GOING TO ENHANCE CARE MANAGER AND YOU DID MENTION THAT- AND REALIZING THAT PEOPLE ARE GONNA STAY ON IT FOREVER NECESSARILY DEPENDS ON WHAT THEIR SITUATION IS. THAT THAT THAT- I WOULD SAY THE GOAL IS BUT THE ESTIMATE IS THAT EVENTUALLY 5% OF MEDICARE RECIPIENTS OF PRICE FIT IN THAT CATEGORY IS. SO IT DOES NOT CLARIFY- HOW MANY PEOPLE DO EXPECTS TO. THEN GET ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT AND- IS THAT BASED ON NEED OR STARE AT IT OR IS THERE A CAP. BECAUSE. OF FINES THIS CALL REASONS. SO IT IS A BAD IS THAT ANTI. AS IT WERE BUILT IN BUT WE CALL CORE MEDICAID. SO IT IS. THERE'S NOT A CAP ALLOWED IN THOSE SERVICES I WAS LONG IF SOMEONE MEETS BEACH ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND THERE'S BEEN AN EVALUATION OF NEED. BASED ON THAT CRITERIA THERE'S DIFFERENT CRITERIA FOR EACH OF THE POPULATIONS OF FOCUS RIGHT ON THEN THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THOSE SERVICES OKAY SO THAT'S IT. THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR SO AND- I GUESS WE'RE JUST ROLLING OUT OF ITS- GIVEN EFFECTIVE OFF LITTLE OVER FOURTEEN MILLION PEOPLE ON MEDICARE- WE CAN TALK ABOUT. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CASES AFTER EMERGENCIES OVER. 5% WOULD MEAN- AT AROUND SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND SO. WE'RE WE'RE ALL OFF TO THE START HERE NINETY FIVE THOUSAND SO. I WOULD MAKE NOTE OF THAT AT LEAST BUDGET TERRIBLY- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR- MEDI CAL BUDGET R. R. DTS MATHEMATICAL BUDGET THAT- ACTUALLY THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT THAT IS. ONLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR- THIS COMING YEAR AND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX MILLION FOR THAT SO IT'S ACTUALLY LESS THAN OF. THAT FACTION OR PERCENT SO- LOOKING FOR THAT. AND IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO. ANIMALS SAYING THAT- THAT ISN'T ENOUGH BUT ID- JUST WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT- SO FAR- IT'S- THERE'S NO YOU KNOW IT'S NOT LARGE CIVIL IT THAT'S A LARGE SUM IN ITSELF BUT AS A PROPORTION OF TOTAL MEDICAL BUDGETS. NOT VERY LARGE- WHEN COMES TO. SUPPORT AND- ZERO AND I KNOW WE'VE BACK WITH DOWN THE PLANT THE THAT EACH PLAN GETS SITE WHICH YOU SUPPORT ARE DOING AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT IT'S STARTING ROLL OUT HERE- DIDN'T PARTICULARLY COUNTIES WHERE THERE'S- MORE. MOBILE PLAN SO WE HAVE THE CODE IS ONE PLAN BUT IN THE COUNTIES WHERE THERE'S MULTIPLE PLANS- IT WENT WHEN CONCERN WOULD BE IS A STATS- OVERTIME. FANS OF FIGURED OUT CERTAIN OF THE COMMUNITY SUPPORTS MAY TEND TO ATTRACT A CERTAIN CASE MIX VERSUS OTHERS. AND IS THERE GOING TO BE. FROM THE H. C. S. PERSPECTIVE- MONITORING OF THAT AND MONTINI SUCH IS THE CASE MIX OF. PLANS GIVEN WHAT COMMITTEE SUPPORTS THEIR THEIR WILLING TO OFFER AND PROVIDE AND PERHAPS EVEN MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO- PAYMENT RATES THIS PLAN SO THAT WE DON'T DISADVANTAGE. I DON'T HAVE PLANS CHOOSING NOT TO DO CAN YOU SUPPORT IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE THEY REALIZE THAT. CAUSES THEM TO ATTRACT AN ADVERSE CASE MIX. AND AND PUT THEM AT THE SCHOOL DISADVANTAGE. SO IS THERE GOING TO BE MONITORING OF CASE MIX AND THEN PLANT SPECIALTY MULTI PLANNED COUNTIES WERE ESSENTIALLY PEOPLE GET TO CHOOSE I GET THOUGH THIS PLAN VERSES THAT PLANTS. RIGHT I MEAN IT BECAUSE- THEY GOT THE ONE PLANNED SO WE'RE SO WE'RE ABOUT THAT. ALTHOUGH I THINK WE GET TO PUT MIGHT ABOUT SIMPLICITY. WHERE THAT MIGHT NOT BE EXACTLY TRUE. BUT SO WE MONTREAT CHASE MAKES- THAT MIGHT BE INFLUENCED BY. A DECISION BY PLANS OFFER CERTAIN COMMUNITY SUPPORTS BUT NOT OTHERS. I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THE GOAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT IS THAT ALL MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE GONNA BENCHLEY- COVER. UP ANY SPORTS NO I AGREE WITH YOU. UNFORTUNATELY CAN'T REQUIRE THAT YES I'D LIKE TO BUT I THINK WE BOTH TALKED ABOUT WE CAN'T DO THAT YET. I AGREE. BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS YES WE ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING AT CASE MIX AND ACUITY IS A PART OF IT IN FACT WE ARE STARTING TO REALLY WRAP OUR ARMS AROUND- CHANGES THAT WE ARE ANTICIPATING. IN REGARDS TO MANAGED CARE PLANS. ALREADY BUILDING AS YOU KNOW- STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE WILL ALSO BE INCLUDING A QUALITY INTO OUR OUR RATES. ON THE MEDICARE PLAN SITE IN ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT WERE ALSO HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH. ON UP WITH MANAGED CARE PLANS IS THAT ACUITY FACTOR A MORE COMPLEX PATIENTS THE CASE MAKES- AS BEING A PART OF OUR ANNUAL RATE SETTING PROCESS AND SO. ON THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES WE WILL BE TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT OKAY YEAH AGAIN I'D I'D- I JUST DON'T WANT CERTAIN COMMUTE SPORTS BEING DROPPED OFF BY PLANS BECAUSE- AND BECAUSE THERE IS. BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'LL BE DISADVANTAGE THE TACTIC THIRTY CEMEX WILL BE. DISADVANTAGED THE OTHER THE OTHER THING I HAVE TO BRING UP BECAUSE IT INVOLVES MY DISTRICT- IN THE TRANSITION- FOR THE- BETWEEN FEE FOR SERVICE AND MANAGED CARE- AND- TERMS OF SPECIALTY AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- THE- BUT IN A WAY THAT'S- ONE OF THE ISSUES IS IN JULY TWENTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT WOULD PLEASE SEE THE SPOTS THE KAISER BEING TRANSFERRED TO. SOLANO SACRAMENTO COUNTIES AND- UNDERSTAND THERE'S US THERE'S SOME CONCERN AT LEAST. AND BY COUNTY SACRAMENTO COUNTY THAT. WELL I THINK DATES FINALLY RELEASED IN A TO GET IN AS- AND- OF PATIENTS DATA TO PICK UP. WHICH KIND OF STYLE TO ME THAT COULD BE REAL VALE. BUT THEN THE- THE COVER THE CUT THE COST OF HAVING TO PROVIDE THAT CARE OF BEING SHIFTED TO NOW THE COUNTY- CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO. TWO WHAT WHAT'S BEING DONE TO TRY TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. I'M ACTUALLY GONNA ASK WENDY HARRINGTON WHO'S BEEN HURT HER TEAM HAD BEEN LEADING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS OF WENDY CAN YOU TAKE THAT ONE. DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR HEALTH CARE FINANCING SO. YES AND THE TEAM HAS CONTINUED TO WORK. ACTIVELY WITH BOTH SUPPLEMENTAL IN SOLANO COUNTY IS. Q. AND- TO IDENTIFY THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WE THINK ARE IMPACTED BY THIS TRANSITION. AS WELL ADAM IS THAT THEY HAVE WORKED AND LANDED ON THOSE NUMBERS. AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK. IN COLLABORATION. FOR FIGHTING THE- SO NINETEEN FOR THOSE COUNTIES AGAIN THAT IS A PROCESS. AND THIS WILL NOT. HE'S ENTITLED TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE WE'RE CONTINUING WORK WITH THEM TO. SEE IF I CAN REQUEST REALLY BE ACTIVE PLANNING AND FOR THIS TRIP. AND WORKING WITH THEIR PARTNERS. WELL IT'S HARD TO WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT RESOURCE YOU HAVE SO- IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT THAT THEY GET SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO DO THIS I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING HARD ON IT- THE OTHER ISSUE I GUESS QUESTION I HAVE SO YOU KNOW WE'RE CREATING THESE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS FOR MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND- APPRECIATE THE YOU KNOW THAT HAVING THOSE INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE A BETTER QUALITY AND SO FORTH- BUT CAN YOU SPEAK TO IN TERMS OF THE INCENTIVES I GUESS A COUPLE THINGS WE KNOW WHEN WE TALK TOUCH ON CASE MIX RIGHT SO. WE CAN BE SURE THAT PLANS AREN'T PENALIZED TO EITHER RATES OR INCENTIVES BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SECURE YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A CASE MIX THAT'S MORE CHALLENGING AND THEN IN THE CASE MAKE SIDE EVEN ON THE EQUITY SIDE SO. I REALIZED AGAIN THIS IS MEDICARE ALSO IN GENERAL THE PATIENT NO PATIENTS ARE LOW INCOME. BUT- DELETED OFF THE ABOUT THE HELLO RIGHT SO YOU CAN THE ID. AND YOU COULD BE LIVE IN A COMMUNITY. THAT HAS BETTER. TO WHETHER IT'S FOOD SO- YOU KNOW THAT APPROPRIATE FOODS OR- YOU KNOW. HEALTHCARE SERVICES DIETITIANS OTHER TYPES OF THINGS IT'S BETTER- AND YOU COULD BE LIVING IN A COMMUNITY THAT MAY NOT BE- HAVE THE SAME SORT OF SUIT ASSERTS AND- IT'S WHICH MAKES IT HARDER TO FIND. ITS ADDRESS AND SO- HOW IS THE- STATE. HOUSE IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF. WHEN COMES TO YOUR RATE OF ELEVATION AND INCENTIVES. BOTH CASE MIX AND SOME OF THESE EQUITY ISSUES ARE CONTRACTING WITH PROVIDERS WHO ARE ACTUALLY SERVING. THAT JUST YOU KNOW ACTUALLY LOCATED IN THESE COMMUNITIES- AND- AND THEN ALSO THE DRESSING THE- DIFFERENTIAL POTENTIALLY IN SOCIAL TERMS OF HEALTH ISSUES. YOU KNOW FACTORS OF IT IN THE PATIENTS ARE BEING SEEN BY MEDICAL PARTICULARLY PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS. YEAH SO I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION SO IF YOU GIVE ME THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES FROM A RATES PERSPECTIVE WE'RE DEFINITELY TAKING THE- CASE MESSENGER PERSPECTIVE AND WE TOOK A LOT OF THE EXPERIENCE- AND KNEW WHO IS GOING TO BE TRANSITIONING FROM WHOLE PERSON CARE INTO EACH PLANT. TO BE ABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT THE RATES THAT- MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT. FOR TWENTY TWENTY THREE R. AND FORWARD- ON THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM SITE YOU KNOW WE ARE INCENTIVIZING A NUMBER OF THINGS. INCLUDING ON MAKING SURE THAT AS WE BUILD THESE NETWORKS WE ARE MEETING THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF EACH OF THE VARIOUS COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND DOING THAT WITH AN EQUITY LENS. AND BY THAT I MEAN MAKING SURE THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE INCENTIVIZING WHAT I WOULD SAY THE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO CONTRACT WITH PROVIDERS OR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE THAT UNIQUE EXPERIENCE AND- MAKING SURE THAT WE IT IS REFLECTIVE OF THE POPULATION WHETHER THAT'S BY RACE ETHNICITY LANGUAGE ETCETERA. I'M TO MAKE SURE WE'RE MEETING THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF OUR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ACROSS ALL OF THOSE PIECES WITH A CULTURAL COMPETENCY. LENDS AN APPROACH SO THAT IS A PART OF THE- THE MEASURES TODAY ARE IMMENSE AND TRIED DIFFERENT THINGS ANYWAY ANYTHING FROM YOU KNOW EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROVIDERS. MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE SEEING- EQUITY GAP CLOSURE ACROSS THE AREAS- AND FOR EXAMPLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ACTUALLY HAD RECORDED IN OUR INTERIM EVALUATION OF WHOLE PERSON CARE IS THAT WE WEREN'T SEEING A PROPORTIONAL NUMBER OF. INDIVIDUALS THE PEOPLE OF COLOR APPROPRIATELY AND ROLLED INTO THOSE PROGRAMS AND SO WE ARE WATCHING THAT VERY CLOSELY. WITH OUR UTILIZATION PIECES AND WE HAVE INCENTIVES TIED IN THERE TO MAKE SURE WE ARE PARTNERING WITH THE RIGHT PROVIDERS TO MAKE SURE WE ARE. MEETING ALL OF OUR POPULATION'S NEEDS OF AND SO I THINK THERE'S A NICE BALANCE WITH THE WAY WE BUILT THE INCENTIVES THERE BUT OF COURSE. OPEN TO OUR IDEAS AS WE BEGIN TO BUILD. FOR YEAR WELL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE MEETING ALL OF THOSE NEEDS RIGHT NOW I AM A PRETTY. THAT I THINK THERE'S A ROLLING OUT TO ME SO. WANTED THINGS TO IN MY- IS THAT. WE YEAH IT'S A NEW FOR THE PLAN TO. SO THERE THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO TO PARTNER WITH AND SO FORTH- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT A TOO OFTEN- ORGANIZATIONS A PARTICULARLY SERVE- BUT IT'S COMEY'S COLORS OR OTHER- MORE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SOMETIMES AS ORGANIZATIONS- R. AS MUCH ON THE RADAR SCREEN SO YOU KNOW MANAGED CARE PLANS KIND OF LARGE- WE ONLY GOT TO GET OUR PATIENTS A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES- THEY'RE INTERFACING WITH STATE GOVERNMENT WHICH OF COURSE YOU KNOW WE DEAL WITH PUBLIC FUNDS SO WE HAVE CERTAIN ACCOUNTABILITY ISSUES AND THAT'S- THAT'S- I MEAN THAT'S GOOD I MEAN WE WANT TO BE SURE OF MONIES USED APPROPRIATELY. AT THE SAME TIME. IT WILL BE SURE THAT THEY'RE- TAKING THE EFFORT TO OUR REACH IN TERMS OF COMMITTEE SUPPORTS BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE- YOU KNOW I REPRESENT THE ACTS THAT I CHAIR THE ATI LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS AND WE KNOW LANGUAGE BARRIERS RATES ALREADY CONTRACTING AND YARD TO WORKING WITH. YOU KNOW COMEY SUPPORTERS ASIANS FOR THE COMMITTEE SUPPORTS. THAT SHE COULD SPEAK IN LANGUAGE. TWO PEOPLE OTHERWISE LANGUAGE BARRIERS BECOME AN ACCESS- YOU KNOW WE ALSO KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW STUDENTS FROM THE PROVIDERS- ARE THEY GOING TO BE- YEAH I HAD A SENSITIVE. AND TO THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY RIGHT- ARE THEY- SEEN AS BEING PUT OUT POSITIVE TO NOT ONLY LANGUAGE BUT ALSO CULTURALLY SENSITIVE TO- YOU KNOW THE BLACK COMMUNITY OR THE LATINO COMMUNITY SO FAR SO. HOPEFULLY WE'RE MONITORING THAT. I KNOW THAT THE PLANS ARE YOU KNOW THEY'RE JUST. TRYING TO LEARN HOW TO DO SOME OF THIS. TOO AND OF COURSE- YOU DID. BUT OVER TIME A COURSE WE HAVE TO DENNIS ACTUALLY LEARNING RIGHT. THAT THAT AND THAT STUDY IS GOING. TO SOME MONITOR. THERE CAN YOU PUT. IT'S ALSO TO. AND THIS IS THE LINK WITH THE LOCALS WHICH I KNOW TO- YOU KNOW GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE TEND TO DO MEDIC HOW. SORT OF COUNTY BY COUNTY OR COUNTY BAR OR GROUPS OF COUNTIES IT'S ADDRESS. TO GET FEEDBACK FROM THE LOCAL PEOPLE LIKE IS THAT THIS IS A MANAGED CARE PLAN A MANAGED CARE PLANS DEPENDING ON WHAT THE NEEDS GOING ON THE LOCAL AREA THE COUNTY. YOU ARE ALREADY REACHING OUT TO THE TYPE OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS THEY'RE ACTUALLY IVING PEOPLE ACCESS OR NOT AND SO. HE SURE WE HAVE THAT FULL FEEDBACK LOOPS ARE GOING ON. SO THEY CAN SAY LOOK I'M PROVIDING TO ME SUPPORTS BUT IT TURNS OUT THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT YOU KNOW THE ORGANIZATIONS. THAT THEY'RE WORKING WITH AREN'T NECESSARILY THE ONES THAT ARE. ABLE TO REACH INTO- PARTICULAR. DEALS TAKE OUR COMMUNITIES IT THAT OKAY. SO SO I THINK IT'S GONNA BE PART ON MY THINK THAT. IT'S GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT AND- THAT WOULD. APPRECIATE IS- THING IS HAVING NO DEPARTMENT THINK ABOUT. HOW YOU HAD HOW DO YU PUT TOGETHER A REPORT LIKE THAT AND CERTAINLY THAT'S RIGHT AT LEAST I WOULD BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE BE VERY INTERESTED. IN AND SEEING THAT AND SEEING HOW IS. TELLING IS ROLLING OUT. NOW WITH A LOT OF PROMISE NOW WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THAT PROMISE DELIVER AND SO. DOES THAT DOES ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AND SO FORTH AND CERTAINLY EVEN YOU KNOW R. AS IN THE LEGISLATURE WE HAVE DISTRICT OFFICES WE HAVE SOME SIMILARITY TO SOME THE LOCAL FOLKS AND- WOULD PROBABLY HAVE SOME- SOME IDEAS. OR SUGGESTIONS THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL. YEAH I MEAN I. AGREE WITH YOU 1100% WE TALK A LOT INTERNALLY AROUND POLICIES ONE THING IMPLEMENTATION AS A WHOLE DIFFERENT PEACE AND- AND HOW WE BUILD THIS ACROSS THE STATE WILL TAKE TIME AND LIKE YOU SAID MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE BUILDING NEW RELATIONSHIPS AND NEW PARTNERS AND I THINK A LOT OF THEM ARE DOING. A REALLY GREAT GREAT JOB OF LEANING IN. AND REALLY TRYING TO WRAP THEIR ARMS AROUND A REALLY COMPLEX NEW- NO BENEFIT ACROSS THEIR COUNTIES- BUT WE ARE DEFINITELY I TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE WILL. MONITOR AND PULL THESE PIECES WE'VE ALREADY ROLLED OUT SOME PIECES THAT WE KNOW WILL BE LOOKING AT LOOKING AT THE PROVIDER MAKES IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN BENEFICIARY AS YOU RECALL. OR ARE MENTIONING AND IT'S IT IT'S. AND THEY WERE. BUILDING A PROPOSAL FOR HOW WE CAN GET A FULL INVENTORY. OF THE VARIOUS PROVIDERS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE DOING THIS TODAY THEY'RE JUST NOT PART OF MEDICARE ALL. ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- SO THAT WE CAN COMMUNICATE TO THEM DIRECTLY MAKE SURE THEY'RE AWARE OF THE OPPORTUNITY BUILD THOSE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THEM AND MANAGED CARE PLANS. AND THAT'S A PART OF THOSE HALF DOLLARS WHAT WE'LL BE DOING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND LOCAL COLLABORATION. BUT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO START WITH A FULL INVENTORY OF THESE ARE RELATIONSHIPS EVEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES I HAVEN'T ALWAYS HISTORICALLY HAD DIRECTLY- IT VARIES OF COURSE ACROSS OUR VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND SO- YOU KNOW. WE DO KNOW THAT THIS WILL TAKE TIME- BUT WE ARE TRYING TO BUILD THE ROAD MAP FOR HOW WE GET THERE OVER A FEW YEARS OF GROWTH CONNECTIONS PARTNERSHIPS AND HOPEFULLY. EVENTUALLY WE'LL HAVE A REALLY GOOD NEXT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE MEETING. ON ALL THE VARIOUS RACIAL LANGUAGE- AND IN OTHER AREAS AROUND- WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE TO OUR BENEFICIARIES. I'D LIKE. TO ALSO ADD JUST THAT THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT PIECE- OF CALAIS IS WELL AND IT'S WE'RE COLLECTING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH DATA. AND THE PLANS ARE BUILDING OUT THEIR POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES THIS IS ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF SEE HOW. HOW THEY CAN DO BETTER IN TERMS OF DRESSING ON THE POPULATION HEALTH NEEDS. I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO HELP US MONITOR HOW WEIRD YOU KNOW SORT OF HOW WE'RE DOING ON THE OUTCOMES PARKS IN THE QUESTIONS WE FIND OUT WE'RE NOT DOING AS WELL AS WE HOPE WE ARE. AND IT'S GOING BACK TO OKAY HOW DO WE CHANGE THE CURVE ON THAT SO IF YOU HAVE ALL THOSE PIECES HAVE TO COME TOGETHER IN A PAPER SHEET THAT THAT THAT THE FACT THAT WE DO HAVE A POPULATION HEALTH. PIECE THAT WILL HELP US. BE ABLE TO- HAVE DATA SHOW. HOW WELL WE'RE DOING. THANK YOU. RIGHT NOW WE WERE WE ARE ALL VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS AND REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO VERY POSITIVE OUTCOMES. FOR THE COMMUNITY TONIGHT THE NINETY. HOPEFULLY EVERYONE TAKES NOTE OF DOCTOR PANTS GESTIONES AND WE SAY THIS ALL THE TIME IN THE ADMINISTRATION BUT WE'RE ALL OUT IN OUR COMMUNITIES ALL THE TIME AND WE HAVE REALLY GOOD RELATIONSHIPS OFTEN TIME WITH OUR NONPROFITS WHO DO A LOT OF THE SERVICE PROVISION. AND SO ANY ANY WE WOULD LOVE TO HELP IS WHAT WE SAY IF YOU NEED MORE PEOPLE TO BE CONTRACTING WITH THE LOCAL PLANS WE OFTEN HAVE REALLY GOOD RELATIONSHIPS. WITH A LOT OF THOSE PROVIDERS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND CAN CAN HELP YOU UP TO FIND SOME MORE AS RESOURCES IF NEEDED- SO AGAIN THIS KELLY WAS GONNA I KNOW WE'RE ALL UPSET ABOUT THIS AND SAID THE GRENADE ONTINUE TO COME BACK AND KEEP. CHECKING IN ON- TO MAKE SURE THAT IT GOES IT FULFILLS ALL OF OUR EXPECTATIONS LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE CONTINUUM INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM AND BRIDGE HOUSING PROPOSAL. RIGHT SO THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM OR WHAT WE CALL IT- THE H. THE IPS ARE YOU REALLY AIMS TO INCREASE- AND DO CONSTRUCTION ACQUIRE EXPAND PROPERTIES ACROSS RELIGIOUS BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES AS WELL AS ON INVESTMENTS IN THE MOBILE CRISIS INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- DH CS IS RELEASING FUNDS OVER KIND OF SIX GRANT ROUNDS- TARGETING VARIOUS- GAP POPULATIONS I'M NOT GOING TO WALK THROUGH THOSE JUST MAKE SURE EVERYONE'S TRACKING THAT AND THEN ZERO IN ON THE ROUNDS THAT ARE COMING UP SO FOR ROUND ONE I WHICH WAS MOBILE CRISIS IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE DHS AWARDED A HUNDRED FORTY MILLION. DOLLARS TO FORTY FIVE COUNTIES AND TRIBES AT THIRTY SIX OF THOSE WERE IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS AND NINE OF THOSE WERE PLANNING GRANTS- IN ROUND TWO A WHAT WE CALL THE BROADER KIND OF PLANNING AHEAD GRANTS FOR THE OTHER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONSTRUCTION PIECES IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- WE AWARDED FIVE POINT THREE MILLION TO THIRTY SIX ENTITIES ARE TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES NINE TRIBES FOR PLANNING GRANTS TO GET READY FOR THE LARGER INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS IS WRONG- WE ARE CURRENTLY. IN ROUND THREE WHICH IS WATCH READY AT THE RELEASE OF THE WILL OF THE R. EIGHT CAME OUT IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAT'S PART ONE OF THOSE WILL BE DUE IN MARCH MARCH THIRTY FIRST WE WILL HAVE A PART TO HAVE LUNCH READY WHICH WILL BE DUE IN MAY MAY THIRTY FIRST OF THIS YEAR- SO REALLY- FOCUSING ON THOSE AREAS GROUND FLOOR IS AROUND CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND WE WILL BE HAVING A LISTENING SESSION ON MARCH THIRTY FIRST OKAY STARTING TO KICK OFF OF WHAT WE CALL AROUND FOUR AM AND THEN ROUND FIVE IN ROUND SIX ARE A PHASE WILL BE RELEASED LATER IN THE WINTER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- A LITTLE BIT MORE ON ON AROUND THREE- BAR LUNCH READY PROJECTS- WE ARE REALLY LOOKING TO. YOU KNOW EXPAND. CAPACITY TO BRING IN IN PROVIDING SIR FIRST. WE THOSE TO BE OF A IN TWO THREE TO FOUR IN TAKE TIME EVEN WITH THE LINGERIE PROJECT OF WINDING WILL START. CAPACITY BILL. DIRECT SERVICES BEATING IN OUR AND- A THREE TWENTY FOUR OF IT DEPENDS ON THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT THAT WE WOULD BE FINDING. NEW BUILDS WILL TAKE LONGER AS OU WOULD IMAGINE- AND SO POTENTIAL PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN COMING IN- YOU KNOW IT'S GONNA BE VERY- AND WE'LL SEE WHAT. ULTIMATELY GETS FUNDED THERE. ARE PROJECTS FUNDED IN ROUND FOUR OF THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH. THEY WILL DONNELLY AND PRIMARILY BE PROVIDED BY BEHAVIORAL SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND YOUTH UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE- IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH INITIATIVE AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE- A DH CS I WILL ESTABLISH THE- ELIGIBLE FACILITIES. AFTER YOU FINISH THE LISTENING SESSIONS SO WE WANT TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE WE WANT TO ENGAGE WITH. THE STAKE HOLDERS TO REALLY FINE TUNE THE LIST- ABOVE OR WHAT WE WOULD BE RELEASING IN THAT AREA- THROUGH THE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CHILDREN YOUTH AND OTHER DH CS KIND OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH FOCUSED EFFORTS. WE WILL ENSURE THAT THE EFFORTS ARE COORDINATED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THREE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED IN THE ROUND TWO PLANNING GRANTS THAT WE MAKE AVAILABLE AND- REALLY TRY TO CONNECT THOSE DOTS LOCALLY FOR PEOPLE IF THEY NEED THOSE PLANNING DOLLARS TO KIND OF. TIE ALL THOSE RESOURCES AND INITIATIVES TOGETHER- WE ARE WE ARE TRYING TO EDUCATE PEOPLE ON THE OPPORTUNITY THAT YOU SOMEBODY. THAT LARGE NUMBER OF THOSE GRANTS OUT BUT OPPORTUNITIES WHEN WE ONLY HAVE THEM IN TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES WE HELP OTHERS WELL- COME IN AND ASK. FOR SOME OF THOSE PLANNING GRANT DOLLARS AS WELL. AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO- THE BEHAVIOR. NEEDS DH CS YOU DON'T. THE BEHAVIOR HOW NEEDS JUST- TO SET PRIORITIES. ARE REALLY DETERMINED ELIGIBLE ENTITIES AND FACILITIES FOR DARLENE BROWN FIVE AND SIX OF. THOSE BEING RELEASED LATER IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO- THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT WILL BE UTILIZED ALSO FROM SCORING OF THE APPLICATIONS COMING IN FOR. ROUNDS THREE THROUGH SIX SO REALLY ALL THE WAY FROM LARGE READY CHILDREN YOUTH. AND THOSE OTHER FACILITIES WILL BE USING IT TO REALLY GUIDE- SCORING PRIORITIES. THE GOAL IS TO FILL GAPS ACROSS STATE OF CALIFORNIA- AND REALLY MAKING SURE WE'RE USING THAT TO DRIVE. DECISIONS AND IN QUALIFIED ENTITIES ARE EXPECTED TO USE THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT WHICH WE HAVE PUBLISHED AND- RELEASED BROADLY. AS WELL AS OTHER LOCAL ASSESSMENTS. TO IDENTIFY LOCAL NEEDS WHEN THEY ARE SUBMITTING THEIR APPLICATION TO THE DEPARTMENTS. ARE YOU KNOW FURTHERMORE THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH ASSESSMENT HIGHLIGHTED THE ACUTE NEED FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OPTIONS- THAT PROVIDE WRAPAROUND BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES SO AS YOU WOULD IMAGINE- WITHIN THE BUDGET- THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING A ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLAR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BRIDGE HOUSING PROPOSAL- WHICH WOULD FUND. A CLINICALLY ENRICHED. HOUSING SETTINGS FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS YOU HAVE SERIOUS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS BOTH. MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. SERVICES OF FUNDING WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO COUNTIES AND TRIBES TO PURCHASE INSTALL AND OPERATE WHETHER IT'S TINY HOMES OR FOR OPERATING COSTS UPPER BRIDGE HOUSING. AND OTHER SETTINGS INCLUDING EXISTING RESIDENTIAL ADULT AND SENIOR CARE FACILITIES. ULTIMATELY INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS- AMONG THOSE WITH COMPLEX BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. LEADS TO COSTLY CYCLE OF AVOIDABLE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS INPATIENT STAYS. A LONG TERM RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENTS INCARCERATION AND ULTIMATELY. CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS SOMETIMES- ENCODED. HAS REALLY JUST EXASPERATED THESE CHILD SO THE IMPACT- WILL GIVE LOCAL B. HEALTH SYSTEM- DEDICATE RESOURCE JUST A IN THE WITH TERM OR IN HOUSING- WELL THEY'RE EXPERIENCING A SERIOUS BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONDITIONS. THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE TIME FINANCE. NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER SHE HAVE. THANK YOU- CENTER ADMIN COURT SHE TAKEN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE JUST HAVE A FEW COMMENTS TO RAISE ON THE GOVERNOR'S BRIDGE HOUSING PROPOSAL- FIRST THOUGH WE JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A FORTHCOMING BRIEF FOCUSED ON. THE GOVERNOR'S MAJOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROPOSALS COMING OUT NEXT WEEK WHICH WILL COVER THE BRIDGE HOUSING PROPOSAL- AS AS WELL AS A FEW OTHER OF THIS YEAR'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BUDGET ITEMS- IN IN FURTHER DETAIL- REGARDING BRIDGE HOUSING YOU KNOW FIRST WE WOULD NOTE THAT WE FIND THE APPROACH TO FOCUS RESOURCES ON BRIDGE HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WITH. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS HAS MERIT- THIS SPECIFIC POPULATION FOLKS WHO STRUGGLE WITH BOTH HOMELESSNESS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- HAS SEEN EACH CARE NEEDS AND- WE DO FIND THAT THE PROPOSAL TARGETS A KEY GAP IN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE BY FUNDING BRIDGE HOUSING WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY A FOCUS OF- CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF. THE SIX PRIOR SPENDING ON HOMELESSNESS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL EXISTS AT A VERY CONCEPTUAL STAGE RIGHT NOW- WITH KEY DETAILS OUTSTANDING RELATED TO. HOW THIS PROPOSAL WOULD WORK IN PRACTICE- IN ADDITION YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PLANNING TO HAVE A TRAILER BILL FOR THIS PROPOSAL- THESE THESE TWO FACTORS TOGETHER MAY ULTIMATELY SORT OF LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF INPUT THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ON DEVELOPING THIS PROPOSAL FURTHER. YOU KNOW WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OVERSIGHT- THIS TRAILER BILL COULD SPECIFY KEY PROGRAM DETAILS FOR THIS PROPOSAL SUCH AS- FOR EXAMPLE THE SPECIFIC DISTRIBUTION METHODOLOGY- WHETHER A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM OR MORE FORMULA BASED ALLOCATION WHICH- MAY ULTIMATELY RESULT IN FINES BEING DISTRIBUTED TO COUNTIES QUICKER- YOU KNOW. AS WELL AS SORT OF HOW FUNDING WOULD BE PRIORITIZED FOR DIFFERENT REGIONS IN THE STATE THAT MAY HAVE DIFFERENT- LOCAL NEEDS FOR BEHAVIOR HEALTH BRIDGE HOUSING- AND SORT OF WHAT SHARE OF THESE FUNDS SHOULD GO TOWARDS. THE CONSTRUCTION OF TINY HOMES WHICH ARE RELATIVELY NEW CON. FOR A- FOR. RELATIVE TO FUNDING AND EGGS. BRIDGE HOUSING'S- IT COULD ALSO INCLUDE ANY STATUTORY LANGUAGE NEEDED TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS FOR LOCAL APPROVAL OF THE CONSTRUCTION TINY HOMES- WHICH WE OFTEN WE AT WHICH WE UNDERSTAND IS OFTEN SORT OF HELD UP BY BY LOCAL OPPOSITION- NEXT WE WOULD JUST SAY THAT IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THESE BRIDGE HOUSING UNITS PARTICULARLY THE TINY HOMES AFTER THE LIMITED TERM FUNDING FOR THIS PROPOSAL IS EXHAUSTED- EVEN AFTER THE LONGER TERM. FIND A- LONGER TERM UNITS FUNDED BY PRIOR SEED INVESTMENTS COME ONLINE- IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY WILL STILL NEED TO BE A BRIDGE. I NEED FOR BRIDGER SORT OF TRANSITIONAL HOUSING OPTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY AND OF COUNTIES WANT TO CONTINUE OPERATING THESE BRIDGE HOUSING FACILITIES AFTER THIS FUNDING RUNS OUT- THEY WOULD NEED TO COME UP WITH THEIR OWN FUNDING TO DO SO. AND THEIR CAPACITY TO DO SO IS ULTIMATELY UNCLEAR- REGARDING THE TIMING OF WHEN YOU NO LONGER TERM HOUSING UNITS COME ONLINE WHICH ARE SORT OF INTENDED TO BE THE ENDPOINT FOR FOLKS THAT. START THEIR STAYS IN IN BRIDGE HOUSING YOU KNOW WE FIND THAT IT'LL BE CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT. THE DURATION OF THESE BRIDGE OUSING STAYS ACTUALLY DOES ALIGN WITH WHEN THE MORE PERMANENT HOUSING OPTIONS BECOME AVAILABLE. IF THEY AREN'T THEY AND YOU KNOW INDIVIDUALS STAYING IN THESE BRIDGE HOUSING SETTINGS. MIGHT FACE UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS AGAIN OR THE BRIDGE HOUSING UNITS MAY NOT BE VACATED IN TIME TO ACCOMMODATE ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS. THAT ARE IN NEED OF THEM. FINALLY ON THE LINE. MAY WISH TO CONSIDER THE TRADE OFF BETWEEN PROPOSED- WHICH PROVIDE A DISH FUNDS THE B. H. C. I. P. PROGRAM- AND POTENTIALLY MODIFYING OR EXPANDING. EXISTING STATE HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE HOME TO YOUR ROOM KEY PROGRAM TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON INDIVIDUALS STRUGGLING WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. YOU KNOW WE RAISE THIS TRADE OFF AS A CONSIDERATION BECAUSE THOSE EXISTING PROGRAMS MAY HAVE GREATER CAPACITY TO DEPLOY A STORE THESE BRIDGE HOUSING OPTIONS- IN A MORE IMMEDIATE AND QUICK MANNER BECAUSE THEY HAVE A TRACK RECORD OF MAKING. HOUSING AVAILABLE IMMEDIATELY FOR FOLKS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS- AND IT MAY TAKE TIME FOR BEACH SIESTA. ULTIMATELY JUST DISPERSED BNP'S PROPOSE FUNG SAID TO COUNTIES- THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME AND WE'RE HAPPY TO BE USED FOR THEIR SYSTEMS WHERE NEEDED. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH MR SHOULD HAVE- CAN YOU. THAT COURSE MS COOPER JUST ABOUT THE AND I WILL SAY I AM ONE WHO OF COURSE IS VERY HAPPY TO SEE THIS. THIS BRIDGE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT. THE INFRASTRUCTURE MONEY IS JUST GONNA TAKE A LONG OR IT WILL TAKE AWHILE TO GET THINGS BUILT GET THINGS CONSTRUCTED APPROVALS ALL OF THAT. AND OUR OUR OUR NEED IN A CRISIS IS NOW IS A REMINDED US THE TEMPERATURE DIPS DOWN TO. TWENTY SIX AGAIN TONIGHT- HOW THAT MUST BE TO BE UNSHELTERED ON THE STREETS- SO CAN YOU CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT DISCONTINUING THE BRIDGE. IS IT REALLY THE BEST WAY TO DO IT. AND HOW ARE YOU COORDINATING WITH ROOM KEY AND HOME KEY AND HEAT. AND ALL THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE DOING SOME OF HIS MORE SHORT TERM HOUSING. SURE SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS ASK MARLEY'S PREZ ON TO REALLY ADDRESS SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS SHE'S BEEN. ARE THE LEAD ON THE- BEHAVIOR HEALTH C. I. P. PROGRAM HAS DONE AN AMAZING JOB GETTING THE ROUNDS UP. AND RUNNING- IN COORDINATING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE SS AND OTHERS IN REGARDS TO ALL OF THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS IN PIECES. AS WELL AS SHE WILL BE LEADING THAT BRIDGE HOUSING PARTS AND MAKING SURE THERE'S CONNECTIONS AND- ONE OF THE PIECES AROUND THE BRIDGE HOUSING AND MAKING SURE THERE IS A LONG TERM PLAN OR CONNECTION TO OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT THERE IS A- A PATH. FORWARD FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS BUT- HOPEFULLY NO CLASS- AS IT'S BEEN ARTICULATING BUT- I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY LEAST YOU. ADD ADDITIONAL. CONTEXT OR INFORMATION FOR YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING ALMOST AFTERNOON. YEAH SO TO YOUR QUESTION WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY CLOSELY. WITH OUR SISTER DEPARTMENT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND STANDING UP HM AS THEY'RE ROLLING OUT THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION. PROGRAM AND ALSO JUST REALLY MODELING AFTER ALL THE LESSONS LEARNED FROM ROOM KEY. AND HOME KEY AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK WHERE WE HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN THE BRIDGE HOUSING IS REALLY AROUND THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COMPONENT. AND JUST THOSE PARTNERSHIPS ALREADY ESTABLISHED WITH OUR COUNTIES AND TRIBAL ENTITIES THAT ARE ALREADY PROVIDING THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. SERVICES AND REALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WITH THIS BREAK THIS HOUSING IS PROVIDING THAT. FUNDING FOR THE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S THOSE WRAPAROUND SERVICES. SERVICES THAT WE ALREADY MENTIONED IN CALLING. THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAIVERS TO ECM AND SO WE FEEL REALLY WELL POSITIONED IN ORDER TO HELP COUNTY STAND THIS. QUICKLY BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS THAT NEED THAT NEED IS RIGHT NOW AFTER TALKING. AND THEN ALSO JUST YOU KNOW IN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE JUST BROUGHT UP WITHOUT HAVING THAT. PLACE THE LAND YOU KNOW THAT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. ALSO WERE REALLY WORKING. TOGETHER ACROSS THE ADMINISTRATION IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS BREAK FIX ALL AND HAVE IT BE A BRIDGE YOU SOMEWHERE. I'M SO INDIVIDUALS. JUST DON'T FALL OFF LIKE YOU MENTIONED. AND IN YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH THE WITH THE COUNTY. YOU FEEL LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO BE A TO ACQUIRE. THE LAND THE SPACE AS WE READ THE NEWS THIS WEEK. THAT RENTS HAVE GONE UP TO THE HIGHEST EVER. IN THE UNITED STATES AND WE KNOW THAT IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S THE MOST HIGH AND I'VE JUST I'VE TALKED WITH A LOT OF FOLKS WHO HAVE VOUCHERS THAT THAT. THEY CAN'T USE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND A PLACE. SO HOW. ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO. DO THE COUNTY'S FEEL HOPEFUL THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE IT. EFFECTIVELY TO BE ABLE TO. GET HOUSING. AND NOT- FURTHER IMPACT OF A VERY ALREADY A VERY TIGHT MARKET. YEAH AND SO IN SPEAKING WITH THE COUNTY'S THEY'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T TRADITIONALLY HAVE FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR HOUSING AND WE LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUAL WITH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS ON UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALL HOUSING TYPES WANT TO TAKE THAT INDIVIDUAL BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY SURE. YOU KNOW HOW TO WORK WITH THEIR MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER WELL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL COMPANIES HAVE ESTABLISHED THESE RELATIONSHIPS AND WITH HEALTHY PARTNERS BUT A LOT OF THE TIMES THEY JUST HAVEN'T HAD THE FUNDING AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO PAY FOR THAT BECAUSE THAT IS NOT IN OUR SERVICE THAT IS TRADITIONALLY PAID FOR WITH MEDIC HOW- OTHER FUNDING SOURCE. I'M SO THEY'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS EFFORT TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND MORE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND TO BE ABLE PROVIDE TEST FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS LIKE SPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE YOU KNOW LEAVING THE TREATMENT I THINK MAYBE THEY HAVE. NOWHERE TO LIVE AND THEN UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NO WORD TO LEAD THEN IT JUST YOU KNOW CAN REPEAT THEIR CYCLE AND THEY pSERVICES AGAIN- SO YEAH IN OUR. DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COUNTING. THEY'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CONFIRM TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT I SEE LIKE. SOME OF THE SMALLER COUNTIES CALAVERAS DELL NORT BUILDER AUTO- THEY RECEIVED FUNDING BUT THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CATCH THAT SET UP ANY NEW TEAMS YET. IS THAT DID WE EXPECT THAT FOR SOME OF THESE THE SMALLER COUNTIES. I CAN TAKE THAT ONE SO BAD I THINK WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS WITH OUR BEACHES ARE ROUND ONE MOCK BROWN RICE THAT'S CORRECT AND SO AND YOU KNOW AS I'M SURE YOU KNOW COUNTIES ARE ALL IN DIFFERENT STAGES OF WHAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE WITH MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS. AND SOME OF THE COUNTIES JUST HAVEN'T HAD A MOBILE CRISIS TEAM AND WE'VE SEEN THAT ACROSS MORE RURAL AND NORTHERN AREAS AND SOME IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND SO THAT'S WHY WE OFFER THIS PLANNING GRANT. AND SO WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS PLANNING GRANT IS HELPING THEM MAYBE ESTABLISH THEIR FIRST CRISIS TEAM THAT THEY'VE EVER HOT- AND THEN WE THANK CRISIS TEAM YOU KNOW IT'S THERE'S REALLY DIFFERENT MODELS- INVERELL AREAS THERE'S A LOT OF CRISIS TEAMS. I'M IF THERE IS ONE IT'S REALLY JUST A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WITH MAYBE A CLINICIAN- WHICH IS ALL THAT THAT THEY CAN DO AT THAT POINT AND THAT MAY BE DUE TO TRANSPORTATION RESTRICTIONS OR MAYBE IT'S JUST. YOU KNOW NOT HAVING ENOUGH WORK FORCE- BUT IN SOME OFTHOSE AREAS THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT MODEL SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS. THAT HELPED THEM ESTABLISH SOME LEVEL OF CRISIS SERVICES- SO WE'RE HELPING THEM CREATE THIS PLAN WE'VE ALSO YOU KNOW SAVED A LITTLE MONEY FROM THEM SO THAT THEN THEY'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE SO ANY OF THOSE PLANNING GRANTS. HAVE BEEN AWARDED WILL THEN BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME FUNDING- TO ACTUALLY ESTABLISH A THEME. OKAY AND I DON'T KNOW WHO CAN ANSWER THIS FOR ME BUT JUST. JUST AGAIN IN IN TALKING WITH COUNTY SOME PEOPLE'S FRUSTRATION OFTEN TIMES WITH THE APPLICATION PROCESS. AND THE RESTRICTIONS FOR EVERY PART OF MONEY. BUT WE'RE JUST HOPING THIS IS GOING TO BE AS SEAMLESS AS POSSIBLE FOR COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO PULL THIS DOWN- AND HOPEFULLY WITH THIS MOBILE CRISIS I MEAN WE KNOW IT TAKES ABOUT FORTY TOUCHES SOMEBODY TO GO INTO TREATMENT. UNDER THE QATARI START SOME OF THAT WORK BEFORE WE HAVE THE HOUSING CONSTRUCTED SO HOW WE MAKING SURE WE'RE MAKING IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE. TO BE ABLE TO PULL DOWN THIS MONEY. AND THEN BE ABLE TO SPEND IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. YES WE READ. AND WHEN THE LET'S JUST. PROVE AS FAR- YOU KNOW THAT THERE WAS AT A- SINCE THE- THAT WHY WE- THIS RUN. ONE ROLLED IT OUT SO QUICKLY. AND WE ALREADY HAVE CONTRACTS COMPLETED FOR THOSE COUNTIES THAT WERE MENTIONED IN TRIBAL ENTITIES- AND SO SOME OF THEM ARE ALREADY ACTUALLY STARTING. TO DO SOME OF THESE. AND THIS IS REALLY GONNA BUILD IN I KNOW LATER ON IN THE AGENDA TALKING ABOUT FIRST. ADDING THE MOBILE CRISIS- SERVICE IS AVAILABLE AND EXPANDING UNDER MEDIKAL. AND SO WE'RE EXCITED TO BE ABLE JUST TO HELP COUNTIES YOU KNOW REALLY GET- BOLSTER UP BED CRISIS TEAMS THAT THEY HAVE. ON AND ONCE AGAIN WE'RE ALSO PROVIDING A LOT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL KIND OF AT DIFFERENT LEVELS- BUT REALLY PREPARING THEM BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THIS IS YOU KNOW I NEED NOW BUT ALSO HELPING THEM PREPARE. THEM FOR FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES. THANK YOU AT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- FIRST OF ALL I JUST- WANT TO- REALLY WHAT CHAIR TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF- CLOSEST I BELIEVE SO WE GET TO HEAR ALL OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES I HEAR YOU YOU SAID YOU'RE NOT WORKING WITH. YOUR SISTER AGENCY DSS AND SO FORTH I THINK IT'S BEEN NOTED ON THOSE THAT ELLIE OR THE AUDITOR THAT- WE HAVE A LOT OF THEM FIRST- HOMELESSNESS- NO HEALTH RELATED ILLNESSES I SHOULD POINT OUT THAT NOT ALL HOMELESSNESS IS DUE TO MENTAL HEALTH. SOMEONE WENT OUT ON A CONFLICT TO. BUT THAT- WE HAVE A LOT HOUSING PROGRAMS. AND WHAT WE DON'T GET IT IN AND THEN THE PLETHORA OF HOUSING PROGRAMS AND PROGRAMS ARE ADDRESSED HOMELESSNESS. WE JUST DON'T WANT THEM TRIPPING UP AGAINST EACH OTHER SO CERTAINLY HILLARY SUPPORTIVE OF THE IDEA OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BRIDGE HOUSING- PREVIEW WHAT THE ELIA SAID ABOUT THAT- APPRECIATE YOU'RE GONNA TRY TO COORDINATE WITH OTHER HOUSING PROGRAMS. BUT ALSO JUST THE CONCERNED ABOUT FRAGMENTATION AND SO WE HAVE ONE YOU KNOW WE HAVE A PROGRAM IS AND THEN YEAH YOU HAVE THE PEOPLE ON THE GROUND TRYING TO NAVIGATE OKAY YOU KNOW IT GOES THIS HOUSING PROGRAM THAT HOUSING PROGRAMS. WE HAVE THIS MANY UNITS IN THIS HOUSING PROGRAM WE DON'T HAVE AS MANY UNITS IN THAT ONE WE COULD USE ONE OVER HERE BUT THE ONLY QUALIFY FOR THAT ONE SO. SO I DON'T I DON'T WANT TO TRIP OVER OURSELVES HAVE DIFFERENT. OTHER DIFFERENT PROGRAMS EACH ONE CERTAINLY MEETING A NEED THAT'S THEY'RE NOT DENYING THAT. BUT THAT WE HAVE EACH ONE IN A NARROW WAY AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO. MAKE IT COMPLICATED PEOPLE HAVING TO NAVIGATE RIGHT SO- THE INTERNET TO NAVIGATE ALL THESE PROGRAMS SO- SO AGAIN I APPRECIATE THAT YOU SAID THAT YOU ARE WORKING WITH IT I JUST. HOPE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL THESE VARIOUS HOUSING PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE TRYING. TO SIMPLIFY THINGS SO THAT WE DON'T END UP. AND I HEAR WRONG. NOT OTHER THINGS BUT I. DON'T JUST DON'T WANT TO CREATE GREATER COMPLICATION- SO LOOKING FOR. TO HEARING HOW THAT. OUT BOTH MY LOCALS AND FROM YOU AS WE ROLL OUT IMPLEMENT. THE OTHER. I GUESS THE QUESTION I DID HAVE HIS ON- OBVIOUSLY ON CHILDREN YOUTH ACTUALLY OBVIOUSLY BEING PEDIATRICIAN- SO YOU SAID IN TERMS OF THE TYPES OF PROJECTS YOU KNOW YOU WANNA DO IT AFTER YOU LISTENING SESSIONS AND SO FORTH- WHAT IT WHAT'S THE TIMELINE ON DETERMINING. THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT WOULD BE FUNDED SO- EIGHT THINK YOU AND TURN OVER WHICH TEACH YOU SAID YOU'RE LISTENING SESSIONS WILL TAKE PLACE SO WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE TIME LINE GOING TO BE WE'RE GOING TO BETTER DEFINE. THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THEY'LL BE FUNDED. IN ROUND FOUR WITH THE USING FUNDING ROUND. SO I'LL TAKE THAT ONE- SO WHAT WE ARE DOING LIKE YOU MENTIONED WE HAVE OUR LISTENING SESSION IN MARCH. AND THEN WE ARE GOING TO BE PUTTING OUT SOON FTER WHAT WE'RE CALLING A PROGRAM UPDATE WE DID THAT. WITH OUR EARLY AROUND AS WELL. IT'S JUST REALLY IT'S KIND OF A SNEAK PEEK. OF THE RFA. SO ELIGIBLE ENTITIES CAN START LOOKING TO SEE YOU KNOW. WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKING FOR ITEMS LIKE THE MATCH ALL THOSE TYPES OF REALLY IMPORTANT DETAILS. I'M SO THAT'LL BE COMING OUT A FEW MONTHS AFTER. AND THE LISTENING SESSION AND THEN WE'RE EXPECTING TO RELEASE. ON THE RFA I'M SOMETIME. EARLY THIS SUMMER- MAYBE SOMETIME AROUND JUNE OR JULY OR AUGUST WE'RE KINDOF LOOKING AT THAT TIME FRAME- BECAUSE WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN. YOU KNOW GET THE RFA OUT THERE AND GET THESE GRANTS AWARDED BECAUSE I'M LIKE CHIEF YOU MENTIONED IT TAKES TIME. I'M FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND WE KNOW THAT THIS IS. REALLY NEEDED ESPECIALLY FOR THIS ROUND AND FOR OUR CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FACILITY OKAY SO YOU MENTIONED IS THAT. LISTENING SESSION A MARSHALL PROVIDE AT LEAST SOME INITIAL GUIDANCE TO PEOPLE PROBABLY IN THE SPRING AND THEN THE ACTUAL RC ON THE SUMMER SO. THAT SOUNDS LIKE JUST PERFECT TIMING FOR ME REVISE SO CERTAINLY WOULD APPRECIATE AN UPDATE WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY BETTER ARTICULATE. THE TYPES OF PROJECTS OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT THE FLOOR SAY BUT- THAT'D BE HELPFUL. IT WOULD BE SITTING OUT. THE INFORMATION ON WHAT. AFTER LISTENING SESSION WHAT TYPE OF PROJECTS YOU ARE NOW SEEKING. TO BUT OFFICIALS YOU KNOW. ASK PEOPLE OUR FAITH FOR. WELL MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX MEDICO QUALIFYING COMMUNITY BASED MOBILE CRISIS INTERVENTION SERVICE BENEFIT. PERFECT BECAUSE OF THE BUDGET REQUEST A HUNDRED AND EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION TOTAL FINES- AFFORD THE BUDGET EAR TO IMPLEMENT THE MOBILE CRISIS PROGRAM BY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY THREE. CURRENTLY THERE S NO STATEWIDE STANDARDIZED MEDICARE BENEFIT COVERING MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE SERVICES AS DOUBLE SEVERAL FACTORS ARE DRIVING THE NEED FOR THE CHANGE. INCREASING ACUITY OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS CAUSED BY TRAUMAS OF THE PANDEMIC I NEED TO DIVERT PEOPLE EXPERIENCING BEHAVIOR HEALTH CRISIS FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT ENCOUNTERS- TWO TREATMENTS ARE PREVENTING INAPPROPRIATE INVOLVEMENT IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM JUST PARTIALLY AFFECTING PEOPLE. OF COLOR- AS WELL AS THE NEW OPPORTUNITY IN THE AMERICA RESCUE PLAN ACT UP FOR ENHANCED FEDERAL MATCHING FUNDS FOR THE FIRST THREE YEARS I'M A FIVE YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING APRIL TWENTY TWO THROUGH MARCH OF TWENTY SEVEN. WHILE CRISIS INTERVENTION SERVICES ARE CURRENTLY AT LIMITED MEDICAL BENEFITS SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH DRUG MEDI CAL INDIAN CO DS THERE IS NO STATE WIDE REQUIREMENT ABOUT A STANDARDIZED SET OF ON CALL A GENE BASED CRISIS RESPONSE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE- THROUGH THIS MOBILE MENTALITY FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. I SAID YES YES PLANS TO ENGAGE WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AGENCIES PROVIDERS CONSUMER ADVOCATES AND OTHER PARTNERS TO REALLY INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MOBILE CRISIS BENEFIT MEDIKAL INCLUDING THE COVERED SERVICE COMPONENTS THAT SERVICE CRITERIA. A COMPOSITION OF THE MOBILE CRISIS TEAM AS WELL AS OTHER KIND OF- YOU KNOW PROVIDER QUALIFICATIONS THAT NEED TO BE CONSIDERED A FEDERAL GUIDANCE REGARDING THE MOBILE CRISIS OPPORTUNITY DESCRIBES. VERY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR PROVIDERS DELIVERING MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES- UNDER THIS AUTHORITY INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE TEAM TO INCLUDE AT LEAST ONE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL WHO IS QUALIFIED TO PROVIDE AN ASSESSMENT WITHIN THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE ALSO WE WILL HAVE. TO COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL GUIDANCE AND OUR THE OPPORTUNITY AS WELL. THE GUIDANCE ALSO IN. THAT OTHER TEAM MEMBER MAY INCLUDE OUR SYSTEM WORKERS ARE PEER SUPPORTS RELEVANT EXPERIENCE AS WELL ALL OF THOSE FACTORS WILL COME INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE BILD THAT THE BENEFIT- THE GUIDANCE ALSO SETS FORTH A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS FOR SKILL SETS AND COMPETENCIES THAT ARE REQUIRED. I'M IN SERVICE DELIVERY STANDARDS FOR THE MOBILE CRISIS TEAM- THAT WILL BE NEEDED- AND DCS IS REVIEWING BEST PRACTICES AND LITERATURE- WE ARE LOOKING AT STRONG EXAMPLES WITHIN CALIFORNIA WHERE THIS HAS BEEN DONE VERY WELL- AND APPROACHES THAT THAT OTHER STATES HAVE IDENTIFIED IN REGARDS TO BEST PRCTICES. AS WE REALLY KIND OF BUILD THAT ARE MOVING FORWARD- ADDITIONALLY WE ARE ASSESSING A VARIETY OF COMPONENTS ON THE REIMBURSEMENT APPROACH FOR MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES- UNDER THE CURRENT REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY I G. H. T. S. PROVIDES- YOU KNOW. COST BASED REIMBURSEMENT TO OUR COUNTY PARTNERS WHICH INCLUDES ARE COSTING HER TO PAY EMPLOYEES WHEN THEY ARE NOT ACTIVELY RENDERING SERVICES- THAT IS A PART OF. B. H. A PAYMENT REFORM AS WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IN THE AGENDA WHICH WILL BE GOING LIVE EFFECTIVE JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE A PAYMENT FOR THIS A SERVICE WILL TRANSITION EVENTUALLY TO EIGHTY. P. FOR SERVICE SCHEDULED- AND THERE IS A DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR RATE MODELS FOR MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES AS WE BUILD THAT BEEPER SERVICE RATE SCHEDULE- THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED AFTER JULY FIRST- OF COURSE WHEN WE BROUGHT THAT OUT. AND THAT INCLUDES OPTIONS AROUND PER DIEM PAYMENTS EPISODIC PAYMENTS- AND SMALLER KIND OF INCREMENTAL PAYMENTS ON SUCH AS FIFTEEN MINUTES OR HOURLY UNIT SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL OF THOSE OPTIONS AND DISCUSSING. THOSE WITH OUR PARTNERS- BUT YOU REALLY REGARDLESS OF THE RIGHT MODEL AND THE RATE SETTING PROCESS. IT CAN COPERATE YOU KNOW KEY CONSIDERATIONS FOR ENSURING ALL- ON CALL AVAILABILITY FOR MOBILE CRISIS SERVICE. WHICH COULD BE- YOU KNOW FACTOR IN IDLE TIME EXAMPLE. WE ARE WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT MAKE SURE WE'RE VERY COCKY OF THAT WE BUILD- COVERAGE FOR CHRIST SERVICES THE MEDICARE REPRESENTS A Y. OF THE THREE G. PILLARS. CHRIST CARE CAN. HELLO WITH PRICES YOU KNOW CALL SERVICES AND CRY STAPLES. START ALL CREDIT COMPONENTS- IN- K. JUST IS PREPARING TO LAUNCH STAKEHOLDER. EFFORT TO SUPPORT THE DESIGN AND PLANNING EFFORTS FOR THE NINETY DAY CISIS. HOTLINE IT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT TO ENSURE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES THAT THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY- IN NEED OF MOBILE CRISIS CAN BE CONNECTED TO THOSE SERVICES AND- DAC. FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH- KELLY JUST AS AN AGENCY AND STAKEHOLDERS DURING THAT- DESIGN PROCESS. AND THAT IS THE CONCLUSION OF MY COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IN YOU NO ADDITIONAL. HELLO. THANK YOU AT SENATOR ADMIN KOREA SHE DID WITH THE LA- I CAN- WE JUST HAVE A FEW COMMENTS RAISE ON THE NEW MOBILE CRISIS BENEFIT- FIRST WE JUST FIND THAT YOU KNOW ADDING THIS NEW BENEFIT TO MEDIC HAL DOES HAVE MERIT AS IT APPROPRIATELY TARGETS A GAP IN THE BEATER HEALTH CRISIS CONTINUE- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE MANY COUNTIES THAT EITHER DO NOT OPERATE ANY MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS OR OPERATE JUST A FEW- IN ADDITION DECSS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT REPORT ALSO IDENTIFIES MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES. AS A KEY AREA TO ADDRESS IN THE HOUSE PRICES CONTINUE ON HOWEVER WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE GATHER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BEFORE TAKING ACTION ON THIS PROPOSAL IT WE WOULD KNOW THAT THEREARE SOME KEY DETAILS RELATED TO THIS PROPOSED NEW BENEFIT WHICH ARE NOT YET AVAILABLE TO FULLY ASSESS ITS MERITS- SOME OF THESE YOU KNOW KEY DETAILS THAT ARE OUTSTANDING THE ADMINISTRATION JUST JUST WENT THROUGH. THEY WOULD INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE HOW STATEWIDE STANDARDS FOR THESE MOBILE CRISIS INTERVENTION SERVICES WILL BE DETERMINED HOW THE PAYMENT RATES FOR THESE SERVICES WILL BE DEVELOPED- ON THE PAYMENT RATES YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT THESE RATES WILL INCLUDE CERTAIN NON SERVICE COSTS LIKE IDLE TIME WHILE MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS ARE ON CALL- POTENTIALLY TRANSPORTATION COSTS. THESE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS MAKE THIS A KEY DETAIL TO HAVE AVAILABLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE WHEN IT REFUSED THIS PROPOSAL- WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DOES PLAN TO HAVE A TRAILER BILL FOR THIS PROPOSAL WHICH MAY PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION ON ON THESE ISSUES BUT THAT LANGUAGE. IS NOT YET AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW. ALL RIGHT NEXT WE KNOW THAT THE DEGREE OF NEED FOR A DISH MOBILE COUNTY- ALTHOUGH THE ESTIMATE WERE VERY ROUGH THE DEPARTMENT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THESE ESTIMATES MAY NOT SHOW. THE WHOLE PICTURE OF THE NEED FOR MOBILE CRISIS RESOURCES- DECSS BEHAVIOR HEALTH ASSESSMENT RECORD REPORT DOES INDICATE THAT. YOU KNOW THE LEVEL OF NEED FOR MOBILE CRISIS- WIDELY BETWEEN COUNTIES- THESE DIFFERENCES BY COUNTY MAY RELATE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE SOME COUNTIES MAY NOT HAVE ADEQUATE WORK FORCE TO STOP THESE TEENS- THESE DIFFERENCES IN LOCAL CAPACITY RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW BY ABILITIES FOR COUNTIES TO MEET. THE STATEWIDE MANDATED REQUIREMENTS UNDER THIS NEW BENEFIT- FOR EXAMPLE WORLD COUNTIES MAY HAVE A TOUGHER TIME MAKING SURE THAT MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS ARE AVAILABLE TO MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES ON A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN BSIS. WHICH IS WEATHER WHICH IS ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NEW BENEFIT- THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER HOW WE CAN ENSURE THAT COUNTIES HAVE SUFFICIENT LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO MEET SORT OF THESE NEW STATEWIDE REQUIREMENTS- FINALLY WE WOULD KNOW THAT FEDERAL GUIDANCE SURROUNDING THIS NEW BENEFIT. INCLUDE SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR MOBILE CRISIS BEST PRACTICES TO INCLUDE IN THE DESIGN OF STATES MOBILE CRISIS BENEFITS- DO MINISTRATION JUST INDICATED THAT THEY'RE WORKING INTERNALLY ON GIVE FIGURING OUT WHAT WHAT SORT OF BEST PRACTICES TO AND TO INCORPORATE. THESE BEST PRACTICES INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW HOW TO REDUCE LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVEMENT SUCH THAT INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING CRISIS OUR FIRST MET WITH PETER HEALTH PROFESSIONALS RATHER THAN LAW ENFORCEMENT- OR PARTNERING WITH SCHOOL SYSTEMS TO ENSURE ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES FOR CHILDREN YOUTH- WHICH WE UNDERSTAND MAY HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS THAN ADULTS. WHEN IT COMES TO MOBILE CRISIS CARE- ALTHOUGH THE MISTER WORK ON OF LOOKING IN THESE BEST. THE GOVERNOR PROPOSAL DOES NOT INCLUDE. A STRATEGY FOR HOW TO INCORPORATE THESE BEST PRACTICES INTO THE DESIGN OF THIS THIS NEW BENEFIT- YOU KNOW IN ADDITION AS MENTIONED EARLIER THE ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING AT THE AGENCY LEVEL TO DEVELOP. A STRAIGHT PAST THE WHITE STRATEGY FOR THE- ENTIRE BEHAVIOR HEALTH CRISIS CONTINUE- INCLUDING MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES CRISIS FACILITIESAND THE NEW NINE EIGHT CRISIS HOTLINE. THIS REPRESENTS A POSITIVE STEP TOWARD TAKING A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT IMPROVING THE CONTINUUM OF CARE BUT THE LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO MONITOR THE STATUS OF THE DEATH THE UPDATED ELEMENT OF THAT STRATEGY. FROM THE ADMINISTRATION- THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME AND WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE FURTHER ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR AND I WOULD I WOULD- I WOULD GREAT THINK THIS IS VERY AMBITIOUS AND OF COURSE VERY VERY IMPORTANT WE HAVE TO DO IT- IT IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE AND SOME ARE MORE RURAL AREAS ESPECIALLY. WITH WITH WEATHER WITH SPACE WITH TERRAIN WITH ALL A LOT OF THINGS SO WE'RE GONNA BE HAVE TO BE VERY CREATIVE ABOUT HOW WE THINK ABOUT THIS- I DON'T KNOW IF. MISS COOPER'S CAN YOU TALK A I DON'T I GUESS I DIDN'T. I THINK UNDERSTAND THE- RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. THE NINE EIGHT EIGHT AN ONLINE AT AND THE MOBILE CRISIS ARE THERE. THEN I KNOW WHAT I MEAN I UNDERSTAND ONE IS ALREADY. WE'RE DOING IT. THE NEXT ONE BUT THOUGH HOW HOW ARE THEY GONNA BE CONNECTED. SO I'LL START AND THEN TYLER US OUT WITH OUR ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MAY BE ABLE TO DISH MY CHIME IN. YOU KNOW I THINK RIGHT NOW THE BUDGET PROPOSES A MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES- I TO BE ROLLED OUT ACROSS THE- SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH THE NC AND INDIAN C.O. D. S. WE DO KNOW THAT WITH THE UPCOMING IMPLEMENTATION OF NINE EIGHT EIGHT. THERE IS A NATURAL INDICATION OF A CONNECTING THOSE TWO PIECES- AND I THINK THAT IS WHY- I KELLY JUST AS- AN AGENCY OR ARE GOING TO ENGAGE IN A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO DETERMINE. HOW THOSE LINKAGES WHAT HAPPENED WHAT IS THAT ALL PRICES CONTINUE ALMOST LIKE IN THE FUTURE- AND ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH THAT PROCESS BUT A TYLER FEEL FREE TO ADD ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION YOU THINK. IS NECESSARY FOR THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION. THANK IT I THAT'S A- I. THAT THE- TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS TIME LIMITED OPPORTUNITY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS OFFERING WITH RESPECT TO- ENHANCED FEDERAL FUNDING RATES UNDER MEDICARE OUT- MEANS YOU KNOW. WE'RE LOOKING AT. A FIVE YEAR PERIOD THAT BEGAN. BEGINNING APRIL OF THIS YEAR- SIMULTANEOUSLY AGENCY IS BEGINNING THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO BEGIN SOME OF THE- HIGHEST STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND DESIGN DISCUSSIONS RELATED TO NINE EIGHT EIGHT SO I. IDEALLY IF THERE WOULD BE ULTIMATELY INTERCONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE TWO WE KNOW TODAY THERE IS TREMENDOUS- DIVERSITY WITH RESPECT TO HOW MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. WE KNOW MANY COUNTIES ARE CURRENTLY OPERATE MOBILE CRISIS NUMBERS AND HOTLINES AND SO I THINK WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH AGENCY AND WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON- IDENTIFYING AND EXPLORING. THOSE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE INTERCONNECTIONS. THANK YOU HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SEE IT OR IS THERE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN- GOING BACK TO THE- YOUR HEALTH CONTINUUM IN THE BRIDGE WITH THAT THE MOBILE CRISIS. AND THIS MOBILE CRISIS IS THERE I MEAN I KNOW ONE IS FOR. YOU CAN PUT MORE PERSISTENTLY MENTALLY ILL FOLKS BUT THESE THESE THESE CAN BE THE SAME POPULATIONS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. AND ARE THEY GOING TO BE THE SAME TEAMS ARE THEY DIFFERENT TEAMS ARE WE ASKING THE COUNTY TO DO TWO DIFFERENT THINGS OR- IS THERE COORDINATION. YES THE- B. H. C. A. P. DOLLARS FOR MOBILE CRISIS WAS REALLY TO. FIND DOLLARS TO THE COUNTIES TO PREPARE FOR THIS MOBILE CRISIS BENEFIT THAT WILL BE GOING STATEWIDE SO YOU KNOW THAT TAKES TIME- WE NEEDED TO HAVE THE- THE BEATING OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS OF WHAT THEY ARE NEEDING LOCALLY. TO FUND THOSE WITH THE BC I. P. DOLLARS TO GET THAT UP AND RUNNING TO TRAIN STAFF TO GET THOSE CONNECTIONS AND YOU KNOW. MOBILE TEAMS TOGETHER- AND SO REALLY IT WAS THE INTENT BEHIND THE B. ACHT DOLLARS AND WHY WE MOVED SO QUICKLY MARLEY'S AND HER TEAM JUST REMARKABLE AND HOW FAST THEY WERE ABLE TO PULL THAT APPLICATION GET THOSE OUT. AND IN DOING OTHER ROUNDS WAS REALLY SO THAT COUNTIES ARE READY WHEN WE GO LIVE. WITH THIS NEW BENEFIT- ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR THE SAME TEAMS BUTDIFFERENT TEAMS. THAT IS CORRECT OKAY. OKAY ALL RIGHT BUT THEN AGAIN THIS IS SOMETHING REPUGNANT LOT MORE INFORMATION ON- BUT. BUT VERY NEEDED A TWENTY. THAT YOU AND IS WHY SAY THE- APPRECIATE THE EFFORT IN THE PRO- AND- TOUGH CD IMPLEMENTATION BE SURE IT ACTUALLY WORKS AND ALL THE DIFFERENT COUNTIES AS WELL- I KNOW YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT- THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE OF THE ENHANCED MATCH BUT- I ASSUME THAT. WE'RE GOING TO I MEAN THIS IS GONNA BE AN ON GOING- THANK YOU FOR THAT I MEAN DO WE KNOW FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF ONGOING FUNDING. THE CURRENTLY AT THIS TIME THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ONLY FOR THAT FIVE YEAR PERIOD SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AT A TIME IT IF THAT CHANGES OKAY SO LET'S SEE I GUESS WILL. HAVE SOME WORK TO FISHER THAT CONTINUES- BEYOND THE FIVE YEARS THAT OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU NOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO OUR PANEL- FRIEND WILL BE ABLE TO HEAR THEM FOR THE COMMUNITY ABOUT- ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE GOING AND SO TODAY ON THE PANEL TODAY WE HAVE.

ALL RESPOND DIRECTLY TO THE QUESTIONS YOU ASK AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. AND THE FIRST THE FIRST BACK IMPLEMENTATION OF EASY AND THEN CONTINUED TO PARK- WE ARE NOW IN WEEK EIGHT OF TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT YOU CELEBRATE EARLY DATE FOR IMPLEMENTATION AS DIRECTOR COOPER INDICATED EARLIER- LEAN UP TO GO LIVE A LOT OF HARD WORK WENT INTO PREPARING FOR THE INITIAL TRANSITION. LOCAL PLANS WORK PARTICULARLY CLOSELY WITH THEIR COUNTY PARTNERS TO ENSURE A SEAMLESS TRANSITION FROM WHOLE PERSON CARE AND HELP RUN PROGRAMS. OVERALL WE HEARD THAT CONDITION HAS GONE VERY SMOOTHLY AND MEMBER CARES NOT BEEN DISTRACTED THE REALLY PLEASED ABOUT THAT AND OVER THE COMING MONTHS THE FOCUS WILL BE ON ENGAGING OTHER MEMBERS ARE ELIGIBLE TRAINING AND CARE MANAGEMENT AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT. LEVERAGING BTS AND CENTER FINDING TO SUPPORT THE ONBOARDING OF ADDITIONAL PROVIDERS AND THEN CONTINUING TO EDUCATE PROVIDERS AND PARTNERS. ABOUT THESE NEW THERMOSTAT. SECOND WITH RESPECT TO- WHICH I EACH AND COMMUNITY. AND THERE'S A RANGE OF PER. ARE THAT OR WILL BE PROVIDED THE THIRD. THAT CRASH BUT PLAN. AND DELIBERATE VIA PLAN ARE CALM. WITH COUNTY THAT LED. I LED. OR THE PER IS BACK COM WITH ORACLE PERSON CARE HEALTH- I YOU IF EITHER ANOTHER IMPORTANT ON HER. AND MANY OF PREVIOUSLY AS ON PROVIDERS WELL COURT AT PROVIDER TAKE REALLY GOOD ON WHAT COMMUNITY APART EACH PLAN I'M OFFERING. GIVEN THAT MANY LOCAL PLAN ARE OFF TO HELP THE COMMUNITY. PROVIDERS INCLUDE COUNTY AND COMMUNITY DAY HOUSING ORGAN THE. I'M VERY HAVE REGARD HOW THE BENNETT FLOW PLANS TO FOR THE HIGHEST NEED THAT ACCOUNT EARLY AND AS YOU KNOW. EASY AND IS REALLY FOCUS ON THE MAN. WITH ABOUT COMPLEX HEALTH AND SOCIAL CAN. SO CARING HAS ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT PLANS HAVE PROVIDED A DIFFERENT LAW OF IN. ECM IS AT THE MEDIC HAL COVER BENEFIT THAT A BOTH MORE. AND HAS OF A FOCUS ON DRAFTING OF ENTERPRISE. THE EASY MODEL OF K. AT A AND GUIDANCE FOR PHD INCLUDE VERY. AND COMPREHENSIVE MANAGEMENT HEALTH EDUCATION AND CLOSED LOOP REFERRALS. BUT HAVING ONE CARE TEAM THAT WILL REALLY WORK ACROSS THE FENCE WILL BE CRITICAL FOR SUPPORTING MEMBERS. TO GET. GET NUMBERS THAT SERVICES AND CARE THAT THEY NEED. AND LASTLY OUTFIT HOW LOCAL PLANS ARE COORDINATING WITH PARTNERS TO CREATE A COMPLETE CONTINUUM OF CARE- GENERALLY THIS IS OCCURRING BY ESTABLISHING BOTH DIRECT CONTRACTOR ECM AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OR SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES. AND OTHER DEVELOPING REFERRAL SYSTEM THE OTHER SERVICES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY THE PLAN DIRECTLY. AND FOR EXAMPLE LOCAL PLANS ARE ENGAGING WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT YOU DIRECTLY CONTACT AT ECM PROVIDERS. MANY LOCAL PLANS ALREADY HAVE THE CONTRACT WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EXECUTED TODAY AND THAT ARE STILL WORKING WITH THEIR COUNTY I'M READING AN ONBOARDING BUT EXPECT THAT THE CONTRACT WILL BE FINALIZED. SO INCLUDING REPRIEVE THAT INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE- ACCORD HAS GONE BADLY  FORWARD TO LEVERAGING THE INVESTMENT THAT DAY AND MADE IN CALLING TO GROW CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THE MULTI YEAR EFFORT- THANK YOU THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK I'LL WAIT TILL THE ENDLET'S MOVE ON TO DOCTOR- DOCTOR QUEST. AGAIN DISCUSSING THE- CREATING THE. COMPLETE CONTINUE OF CARE FOR. HELLO GOOD AFTERNOON MY CHAIR MY NAME'S DOCTOR RAN QUITE I'M TO BE A TO HELP FIRST COUNTY AS ELECT THE COUNTY BE REAL DIRECTOR SO. BUT CAN YOU BE HERE TO HELP DIRECTOR ARE IN THE MIDST OF A MAN TRANSFER ME IN INVESTMENT LAFACE XTREME CHALLENGING CERTAIN ON GROUND THERE'S A LOT OF UP RIGHT NOW AND IT'S IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION HOWEVER IT'S AT A TIME WHEN WE'RE EXPERIENCING OUR GREATEST WORKFORCE CHALLENGE EVER. THANKFULLY THE LEGISLATION AND THE ADMINISTRATION PRIORITIZED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN LAST YEAR-AND THIS YEAR'S BUDGET BUDGETS LIKE NEVER BEFORE. JOHNNY STARTED THIS YEAR WITH THE FIRST OF SEVERAL MAJOR CALLING REFORMS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. NAMELY THE MEDICAL NECESSITY CHANGES WHICH WILL ALLOW THE SPECIALLY DELIVERY SYSTEM. DESTRUCTIONS EXISTING RESOURCES BY MAKING MORE OF OUR SERVICES ON DOUBLE FOR FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT UNDER MEDICARE AL. THIS INCLUDES THE ABILITY FOR COMPANIES TO DRAW DOWN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR PRE DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES AND AUTOMATIC ELIGIBILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND FOR YOUTH WHO ARE CHILD WELFARE AND JUVENILE JUSTICE INVOLVED. THIS DOESN'T CHANGE YOU ARE SERVING OR THE ARRAY OF SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THIS MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR COUNTY SOME PROVIDERS TO RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR LEGITIMATE MEDICAL SERVICES AND STARKLY. HAVE BEEN DISALLOWED. WE'RE ALSO GRATEFUL FOR THE STATE'S PROPOSED INVESTMENT IN A STATE WIDE MOBILE CRISIS BENEFIT WHICH WOULD OPT CALIFORNIA INTO THE 85% MEDICAL MATCH WE JUST DISCUSSED- WE'RE EXCITED FOR THE POSSIBILITY THAT- STARTING NEXT YEAR. WHEN A CALIFORNIAN CALLS NINE EIGHTY FOR EMOTIONAL SUPPORT THAT WE WILL HOPEFULLY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND. WITH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- MOBILE CRISIS TEAM. TO GET TO THAT POINT THOUGH WE COLLECTIVELY HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO WE NEED TO BUILD OUT A ROBUST CONTINUUM OF ONE. PHONE TRIAGE STABILIZATION LINKAGE REFERRAL AND DISPATCH TO- MOBILE CRISIS AND FIELD STABILIZATION AND THREE FACILITY BASED. CRISIS RECEIVING SERVICES AND STABILIZATION SERVICES. WE'LL TAKE YEARS- WANT TO BE. CLEAR THAT THIS ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY AND IT WOULD TAKE A LOT OF COLLABORATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND- WITH A LOT OF COORDINATION AT THE STATE LEVEL COUNTIES HAVE SOME MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES ALREADY. NOT GETTING THESE SERVICES BUILT OUT ON PAR WITH EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES WILL TAKE SIGNIFICANT TIME INVESTMENT. TODAY NEARLY ARE ALL TWENTY MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS SERVE ANY INDIVIDUAL REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE STATUS MEANING COUNTIES ARE FINDING A BROADER COMMUNITY SERVICE THAT INCLUDES COMMERCIALLY INSURED UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS ON THAT ACCOUNT- BECAUSE WHEN SOMEBODY IS IN A CRISIS YOU DON'T STOP AND ASK SOMEONE TO CONFIRM THEIR MEDICARE ELIGIBLE ELIGIBILITY BEFORE RESPONDING TO THE CRISIS. TO SENATOR EDMONDS POINTS REAL COMMUNITIES FACED AN EVEN MORE DAUNTING TASK OF TRYING TO DEVELOP A MOBILE CRISIS BENEFIT FOR REMOTE AND HARD TO REACH PARTS OF OUR STATE OR SOMETIMES EVEN LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT PROVIDE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN COVERAGE FOR EMERGENCY. BUT BOTTOM LINE THOUGH IS THAT WE ARE ALL IN FOR THE VISION OF A WELL FUNDED AND SUPPORTED PUBLIC. HEALTH SYSTEM. THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM REPRESENTS AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD OUT BEHAVIOR HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. WORKING WITH OUR JOINT POWERS A STORY MESA COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH DIRECTORS COMMISSIONED AROUND STUDY LOOK AT BACK TO PASS THE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS IS IDENTIFIED SIGNIFICANT GAPS WITHIN THE CONTINUAL PARTICULARLY AT THE SUB ACUTE LEVEL THIS IS THE LEVEL OF CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NO LONGER AN ANCIENT SITE CHECK PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY. BUT ARE NOT PREPARED TO GO BACK TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE COMMUNITY. SHE CAN GIVE YOU AN IDEA IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY ARE THREE MAIN PRIORITY AREAS ARE SUB ACUTE FACILITIES USED CRISIS FACILITIES AND S. U. D. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER RESIDENTIAL. AND TALKING WITH MY PEERS FROM OTHER COUNTIES I HEAR VERY SIMILAR PRIORITIES ACROSS THE STATE IN ADDITION SOME COUNTIES THAT PRIMARILY USE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS OUTSIDE OF THEIR COUNTIES ARE ALSO PRIORITIZING. PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITIES WHICH ARE SMALLER AND FACILITIES THAT CAN BE CLOSER. TO HOME INVENTED WITHIN OUR COUNTY. ALTHOUGH WE ARE TO- ALTHOUGH WE HEAR A LOT CLEARER TO APPLY FOR. UNDER THE- THE PROGRAM. I AND I'VE BEEN BUILDING UP MY REQUEST FOR FUNDING THESE DOLLARS ARE NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS A COMPETITIVE GRANT STRUCTURE. THIRTY YEAR SERVICE COMMITMENT AND THE REQUIRED 10% MATCH ADD UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITY AND BARRIERS. ESPECIALLY IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL OF OUR WORKFORCE CHALLENGES. CHALLENGES WE'RE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT COUNTIES WILL NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO EXPAND OUR CONTINUING BEYOND BRICKS AND MORTAR INVESTMENTS WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO EXPAND SERVICES AND NOT JUST BEDS. WE ALSO NEED SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN A WORKFORCE OF THE FUTURE WE NEED TO PAY WAGES THAT WILL ENTICE FUTURE GENERATIONS TO PURSUE THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING. TO ENTER WORK FORCE AND DO THIS IMPORTANT WORK. FINALLY WE KNOW THAT OUR CLIENTS SUFFER NEEDLESSLY AND ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO INCARCERATION AND EARLY MORTALITY. I CAN'T FIND OR KEEP BEFORE PORTABLE CAP HOUSING. MANY OF OUR CLIENTS RELY ON HOUSING VOUCHERS THAT'S ASSIGNED COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FOR HOUSING NEEDS BUT WE SIMPLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. SO THE PROPOSED BEHAVE BRIDGE HOUSING INVESTMENT OF ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS I NEED A PIECE OF THE HOUSING PUZZLE. TODAY OUR CLIENTS ARE SENT TO THE BACK LINE FOR HOUSING RESOURCES BECAUSE OF SHORT SIGHTED HAD RULES THAT DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS COMING OUT OF TREATMENT FACILITIES IN JAILS. THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS URGE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION TO CONSIDER A BRIDGE HOUSING PROGRAM THAT LOOKS MORE LIKE PROJECT ON KEY THEN. THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONTINUUM INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM SO THANKS THANKS TO MY LEASE FOR THE NEWS THAT YOU'RE MODELING THIS PROGRAM ALONG THOSE LINES. WE ALSO HAVE SIMILAR CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY THE LA- REGARDING THE SHORT TERM NATURE OF THESE FUNDS BUT BOTTOM LINE WE ARE STILL VERY THANKFUL FOR THESE RESOURCES. CENTER PAN BEFORE I CONCLUDE THANK YOU FOR RAISING OUR SHARED CONCERNS RELATING TO TRANSFER RESPONSIBILITY FOR ESPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FROM KAISER. TO SACRAMENTO COUNTY LLANO COUNTY. YOU CANNOT BE HALF OF ACCOUNT BOARD OF SUPER. AND C. B. H. T. EIGHT. WE DO BELIEVE WE CAN PROVIDE GOOD CARE. SO IN ORDER TO SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION SERVICES WE NEED A COMMITMENT OF FUNDS TO OBTAIN BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AUTHORITY TO EXPAND SERVICES. THESE ARE INDIVIDUALS WITH SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AND ASTRINGENT TRANSITION NEEDS TO BE DONE RIGHT. WITH THE RIGHT LEVEL OF FUNDING AND SUFFICIENT TIME TO EXPAND SERVICES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR. OKAY LET'S MOVE ON WITH A- HUNDRED CLARK HARVEY PLEASE. THANK YOU I'M NOT SURE ANYONE. UNDERSTAND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THE PERSPECTIVE OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. PONTUS SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THE FIRST IS ABOUT HOW THE INVESTMENTS IN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS CAN BE LEVERAGED TO SUPPORT PROVIDERS AND CLIENTS OKAY CDJ IS VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT COUNTY WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON IMPLEMENTATION WE DO REMAIN CURIOUS ABOUT HOW HEALTH PLANS INTEND TO IMPLEMENT COMMUNITY SUPPORT TO. ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT MORE EVENLY WE DON'T CURRENTLY SEE CONSISTENT OFFERINGS FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY WE WERE TRULY BELIEVE THAT YOUR ZIP CODE SHOULD NOT DETERMINE WHAT ACCESS ONE HOUSE TO SERVICE DESK FIND OUR PLANS ARE WORKING VERY HARD THERE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP. THE BEHAVIORAL CONTINUUM INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM WILL BE ADVANTAGEOUS TO THOSE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE ADEQUATE STAFF IN TIME AND RESOURCE TO PARTICIPATE IN A COMPETITIVE PROCESS SO WE ENCOURAGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE EVERY EFFORT TO BE FLEXIBLE WHEN WORKING WITH- CASHIN WORKFORCE STRUCK WRITERS WORK FINE FOR THESE GRANT FUNDS THAT ARE STILL NECESSARY. WE ALSO WANT TO COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION ON CONTINUING TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS THAT A FEW OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE BY BUILDING UPON ROUTINE HOME CARE AND PROVIDING SUPPORT TO LOCAL PARTNERS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BRANCH HOUSING INITIATIVE. WE WANT TO SEE US AS WAS JUST MENTIONED BY DOCTOR QUEST MORE LONG TERM INVESTMENT HERE MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES AND THE IMPENDING JULY IMPLEMENTATION DEADLINE OF OUR NATIONAL NINE EIGHT HOTLINES ARE CRITICAL COMPONENTS TO OUR SYSTEM OF CRISIS CARE. AND THERE IS A NEXUS I HEARD YOUR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS AT DOCTOR EGGMAN THERE IS A NEXUS BETWEEN THE MOBILE CRISIS IN NINE EIGHT EIGHT SOME OF OUR MEMBERS ARE RUNNING CALL CENTERS AND WE REALLY SEE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE EARLY INTERVENTION. THE CONTINUUM OF CARE OFTEN STARTS WITH BACK CALL TEXT OR CHAT MESSAGE SENT TO YOU WHAT WILL BE THE NINE EIGHT EIGHT OPERATORS AND PROVIDERS WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THIS CAREBUT INTENTIONAL. INVESTMENTS ARE NEEDED HERE TO. I THE COMMITTEE IS ON IN QUITE ABOUT FURTHER INVEST. IN ALL SHARE MY COMMON. WORKFORCE WORK WORK. YOU HEARD DISTANT. ON THE INCREASE MEDICAL AND WALL EARLY FROM D. CS ARE PROVIDED ARE IN. UNPRECEDENTED STOCK ISSUE. COMMUNITY BASE OR- HAVE SHUT DOWN BAD AND CO SPACE DUE TO LACK OF. THAT'S REALLY GOES HAND IN HAND WITH AN ISSUE OF REIMBURSEMENT RATES THAT PROVIDERS ARE EXPERIENCING IT'S TOO LOW WHEN THERE WE GO SHOOTING CONTRACTS WITH THEIR COUNTIES. AND LET ME SAY SOME COUNTIES HAVE DONE AN AMAZING WORK AND HAVE INCREASED RATES AND WORKED WITH AND BEEN FLEXIBLE WITH OUR PROVIDERS. BUT IN SOME CASES RATES ARE SO LOW THAT STAFF CAN'T BE RETAINED WE'VE HEARD FROM MEMBERS. AND THEY SHARED THAT THEY'RE COMPETING WITH AMAZON TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN A WORKFORCE. OUR PROVIDERS NEED AN IMMEDIATE SOLUTION TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES TO MINIMUM WAGE THE TIRE WORKFORCE SHORTAGES DUE TO PANDEMIC AND ALSO TO ALLOW FOR MORE COMPETITIVE WAGES FOR RETAINING AND RECRUITING. WORKFORCE LAST YOU HEARD I'S TESTIFY BEFORE ABOUT DOCUMENTATION BURDEN. NOW WHILE HOW HE WAS POISED TO INSTITUTE SOME EFFICIENCIES THROUGH CHANGES IN BILLING AND WE COMMEND DH CS FURTHER DOCUMENTATION REFORM WORK GROUP. THERE IS STILL A LACK OF STANDARDIZATION AND DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS ACROSS COUNTIES WHICH LEADS TO LOSS OF PRODUCTIVITY. AND RESOURCES MANY CDOS HAVE STAFF WHOSE SOLE FUNCTION IS MONITORING HOW TO DOCUMENT EACH AND EVERY COUNTY WHERE THEY HAVEN'T SERVICES PROVIDE IT. AND LET'S NOT FORGET THE CLIENTS WHO ALSO HAVE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF PAPERWORK TO COMPLETE AND IMAGINE WAITING FOR MONTHS FOR AN APPOINTMENT AND THEN SPENDING THE FIRST. CLIENTS BEFORE WORK NO I SHARED SOME CRITIQUE ON BEHALF OF THE PROVIDERS WE REPRESENT I ALSO WANT THE COMMITTEE TO HEAR THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION AND DH CS HAS WORKED TO HAVE WE TRANSFORM. OUR DELIVERY SYSTEM OPERATES AND IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC AT. SIXTEEN H. A. AND ITS MEMBERS COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION. WE STAND BEHIND OUR EFFORTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR CLARK KIRBY. KIM PETERSON PLEASE DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. HELLO MY NAME IS COMPUTER STAND AND I AM A SENIOR ATTORNEY FOCUSING ON MENTAL HEALTH AND DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ON THIS PANEL. MY COMMENTS ABOUT THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONTINUUM OF CARE FOCUSED ON OPPORTUNITIES TO INVEST IN COMPREHENSIVE UPSTREAM SERVICES AND THE REALMS OF CRISIS RESPONSE AND CRISIS TREATMENT. SUCH INVESTMENTS CAN YIELD POSITIVE PROGRESS TOWARDS STOPPING THE CYCLE OF HOMELESSNESS HOSPITALIZATION AND INCARCERATION THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED HERE AND WERE DISCUSSED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS HEARING TWO WEEKS AGO. FROM OUR WORK THROUGHOUT THE STATE DRC HAS SEEN HOW MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS ALMOST UNIFORMLY RESULTS AND PLACEMENT OF A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD ON A CALL FOR HELP IS MADE. THIS IS BECAUSE THE STATE'S CONTINUUM OF CARE OVERWHELMINGLY DOES NOT SUPPORT ALTERNATIVES RESTRICTIVE OPTIONS. THIS RESULT IN A STRAIN ON EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS BACKLOGS OF PEOPLE WAITING FOR A LIMITED INPATIENT BEDS AND UNTOLD TRAUMA FOR THE PEOPLE WHO FIND THEMSELVES DETAINED. FIRST THIS TREND WE ENCOURAGE DH CS TO FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF PROJECTS WHEN CHOOSING HOW TO AWARD IT'S B. H. C. I. P. FUNDING. AND CONSIDERING HOW TO ROLL OUT THE MOBILE CRISIS BENEFIT. CURRENTLY EACH OF THESE PARTS OF THE CONTINUUM ARE NOT OFFERED IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. EXPANDED THESE SERVICES CAN PROVIDE MEANINGFUL ALTERNATIVES TO INVOLUNTARY HOLDS AN ACUTE HOSPITALIZATIONS HEAVILY IN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT WILL SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF VOLUNTARY COMMUNITY BASED CARE SUPPORT AND SERVICE. BACKEND DH CS SHOULD ADOPT CLEAR STANDARDS THAT REQUIRE MEDIC HOW MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE AND PROVIDE APPROPRIATE CRISIS INTERVENTION TREATMENT SERVICES GEARED TOWARDS HELPING A PERSON RESOLVE THE CRISIS WHENEVER POSSIBLE AND MAKING LINKAGES TO APPROPRIATE FOLLOW UP CARE. THIRD B. H. C. I. P. IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR DH CS TO HELP BUILD OUT THE STATE'S CAPACITY TO PROVIDE CRISIS INTERVENTION SERVICE. THESE SERVICES ARE BRIEF INTERVENTIONS DESIGNED TO QUICKLY RESOLVE A CRISIS WHEN APPROPRIATE CRISIS INTERVENTION SERVICES ARE PROVIDED IN LOCATIONS LIKE MENTAL HEALTH URGENT CARE IS WALK IN CENTRES. SPECS AND SOBERING CENTERS. FOREST DH CS SHOULD USE B. H. C. I. P. FUNDING TO EXPAND THE STATE'S CAPACITY FOR CRISIS TREATMENT OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CRISIS STABILIZATION SERVICES. THIS COULD INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT LICENSE CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS AND EXPANSION OF CRISIS CRISIS RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMS WHICH CAN BE USED AS ALTERNATIVES TO HOSPITALIZATION ASKED TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES FACE WHEN ACCESSING MEDICAL SERVICE. TIME AND TIME AGAIN I'VE HEARD FROM MY CLIENTS THAT THE SYSTEM IS JUST TOO COMPLICATED TO NAVIGATE. THEY DON'T KNOW THE RIGHT ACCESS POINT ARE THE SERVICES THEY MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR OR EVEN THE SERVICES THAT EXIST IN OUR COMMUNITY. THE RCS CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT BENEFIT WILL HELP WITH THE LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES THAT MANY PEOPLE FACE WHEN ACCESSING AND MAINTAINING APPROPRIATE SERVICES. OUR CAUTION COMES FROM OBSERVATIONS THAT MISCOMMUNICATION CAN OCCUR BETWEEN PROVIDERS ESPECIALLY IF THEY WORK FOR DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND OUR INTERESTS ACTING WITH DIFFERENT PARTS OF A PERSON'S LIFE. WE ARE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN MONITORING HOW ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITY SPORTS BENEFIT WORKS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE MEDICAL SERVICES THROUGH BOTH A MANAGED CARE PLAN AND ACCOUNTING MODEL HEALTH PLAN. LASTLY A LACK OF CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE AND LANGUAGE ACCESSIBLE SERVICES IS ALSO A BARRIER TO MANY CLIENTS. WE OFTEN HEAR THAT PEOPLE FIND IT EASIER TO ENGAGE AND SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED BY CLINICIANS TO SHARE THEIR CULTURAL BACKGROUND OUR PRIMARY LANGUAGE. TO THE EXTENT THAT DH CS HUSBAND BUT REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE INVESTMENT PROPOSALS. D. R. C. ARE JUST AN EFFORT TO EXPAND THE POOL OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKERS WHO MATCHED CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC POPULATIONS. INCLUDING LGBTQ I A PLASTIC PEOPLE AS WELL AS PURE AS A PROJECT. AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE TODAY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE PANEL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LET'S MOVE ON TO THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY ON THE- WAY. GOOD AFTERNOON IT WENT AWAY WITH WHAT BETTER ONLINE COPY WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH THE GAME FOR CALAIS BUT REMAIN SKEPTICAL OF CREDIBILITY TO PROVIDE ENHANCED CARE MANAGEMENT FOR COMMUNITY SUPPORT GIVEN THEIR TRACK RECORD. I'M REQUIRED PREVENTIVE SERVICES. ONE NOT CONVINCED BUT LIKE THE NOW THIRD. THERE IS A LOT THERE HOW CAN THEY EXPECT TO ENGAGE IN CASE MANAGED AND- SO SUPPORT PROGRAMS THAT THEY HAVE NO EXPERTISE. IT IS CRITICAL CLANS PARTNER TRUST COMMUNITY PROVIDERS WE APPRECIATE THE INCLUSION OF ORGANIZATION SERVING INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND JEFF BALD INTERNATIONAL WORK BUT PROVIDERS. PROVIDERS SHOULD NOT ONLY HAVE EXPERIENCE SERVING THE POPULATION BUT ALSO HAVE EXPERIENCE SUCCESSFULLY OFFERING ME- ABOUT POPULATION. COURAGE BY THE DEPARTMENT MANDATE THAT PLANNED ATTEMPT TO CONTRACT WORKERS AND CARE AND HEALTH HOME PROGRAM PROVIDERS. BUT THE WHOLE PERSON CARE SUBCONTRACTORS I'M SURE THAT I COULD NOT REACH OUT TO THEM TAKE THAT CONTRACT. IS RAISING CONCERNS THE CLASSICAL RESORT. NOW WE ARE PRACTICING AND CONTRACT WITH PROVIDERS BUT THEY HAVE AN EXISTING RELATIONSHIP WITH RATHER THAN PARTNERING WITH. ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE EXPERTISE. YEAH PORSCHE A CONTENTION MAKE HOW FOR SERVICE WHICH- HELP LINKING WITH HOW AND RENTAL DEPOSITS A STATE MATTER HOW BETTER. AND LACK PROVIDER COMCAST. LIMIT MAKING CURRENT THAT. CONSIDERING THAT THE WEATHER BETTER THE PROVIDING. IN BUILDING COMCAST COULD AND HOUSING HOMELESS BUT THE PROGRAM. WE WRECK MOVING THAT GOAL THE STAFF CHANGE. HOW SERVICES IMPROVE HEALTH OUT THE PEOPLE EXPERIENCE HOMELESS. BUT THE SERVICE ARE ONLY MEANING IF THEY IS A PORTABLE FOR PEOPLE TO MOVE INTO ADDRESS. PAYING ALL CALIBERS FILM BASED MAJOR ABOARD HOUSING SHORTAGE ARE OUT OF DATE. MEDI CAL A MISSION ARE FOCUSED ON HIGH YOU KNOW I WITH GET BACK GREAT RACIAL. AND WHITE PAGE COMPUTER HAD GREATER ACT TO HEALTHCARE. ALTHOUGH PLANS ARE ENCOURAGE TO PARK WITH SHELL AND COMMUNITY. HAVING PLANNED I AND NOW WE TALENT MEMBER WILL LIKELY RESULT IN GRAND. ON HIGH POPULATE. ALREADY ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IS THE BEST RATHER THAN THOSE WHO BENEFIT MARCH BUT IN HER OUTREACH. THREE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW CAN ABLE DRIVING AND HELP OUT. AND REDUCE POWER DISPARITIES TO ENSURE THAT THE CAR A CALL THE GOAL OF THE ARE TO. PROJECT MATCH TARGETS AND CLASS. WILL BE EXPECTED TO ACHIEVE THE NEGATIVE TO HOLD CRIME ACCOUNTABLE PUBLIC REPORT ON THE PROGRESS TOWARD OUR TARGET. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MUCH LET'S MOVE ON TO TARA CAMP EASTERN FROM STEINBERG AND PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON TOM AGAIN E. WITH STEINBERG INSTITUTE. WE'RE IN IN THE NON PROFIT PUBLIC INSTITUTE DATA TO ADVANCING PUBLIC POLICY AND INSPIRING ISSUES INSPIRING LEADERSHIP ON ISSUES OF BRAIN HEALTH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE INVITATION TO JOIN TODAY AND TO SPEAK TO ANY OUTSTANDING GAPS IN THE PROGRAMS BEING DISCUSSED. AND SPECIFICALLY HOW THEY CAN ACT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHILE I'M BEING ASKED TO SPEAK TO THE GAPS THAT REMAIN I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE INCREDIBLE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE JUST IN THE LAST YEAR THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THIS COMMITTEE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION. I'M WELL FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE MORE WORK IS NEEDED WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR IT THE BIGGEST AND BEST- BUDGET FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS WE HAVE EVER SEEN. NINE EIGHT EIGHT AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF HOW MUCH WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH IN A YEAR BUT ALSO HOW FAR WE HAVE TO GO. IN THE LAST YEAR WE HAVE SECURED FEDERAL FUNDING AND INVEST IN OUR OWN DOLLARS INTO EVERY COMPONENT OF THE NINETY EIGHT SYSTEM. IN AN ATTEMPT TO ENSURE EVERY CALIFORNIAN HAS SOMEONE TO CALL SOMEBODY COME AND SOMEWHERE TO GO. BUT THE PROBLEM IN OUR VIEW IS THAT THESE ARE ONE TIME OR LIMITED TERM INVESTMENTS THAT AT THIS POINT DO NOT APPEAR TO BE COORDINATED. CALL CENTER FUNDING IS ONLY AVAILABLE THIS YEAR AND NEXT AND FALL SHORT OF ACTUAL ESTIMATED COSTS. BEACH A DOLLARS FOR MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS AND CRISIS RECEIVING AND STABILISATION CENTRE INFRASTRUCTURE. INSIGNIFICANT BUT SIMILARLY FALL SHORT OF THE REQUIRED SCALE TO REDUCE UNNECESSARY LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVEMENT AND DIVERT PEOPLE AWAY FROM OUR JAILS AND ER. FOR EXAMPLE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS HAVE BEEN CREATED OR ENHANCED USING THE MOBILE CRISIS TEAM. INVESTMENT DOLLARS AND THEY APPEARED TO BE. CLUSTERED IN ONLY A FEW COUNTIES. I MEAN WE ARE THAT CLOSER HUNDRED MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS ARE NEEDED STATEWIDE TO MEET THE DEMAND UNDER NINETY EIGHT. THE SHOCK AND ONGOING FUNDED IT IS CLEARLY NEEDED HERE. AND JUST AS IMPORTANTLY PEACE DOLLARS MUST BE WELL INTEGRATED WITH A PLAN FOR HOW THESE FINDINGS OF COURSE SOURCES SUPPORT NINE EIGHT EIGHT. NINE EIGHT EIGHT FITS WITHIN OUR BROADER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REFORMS AND HOW IT FURTHER LINKS WITH OTHER INVESTMENTS OUTSIDE OF THIS COMMITTEE'S JURISDICTION LIKE THE CRISIS ACT. EVEN OF CALL CENTERS MOBILE CRISIS TEAM TO END CRISIS FACILITIES ARE FULLY FUNDED THE NINETY EIGHT SYSTEM ONLY WORKS IF THERE IS SEAMLESS COORDINATION BETWEEN SYSTEM COMPONENTS. AND THAT THE LINKAGES BETWEEN THEM ARE ALSO FINDING. WE WERE THRILLED TO SEE THAT HHS WILL BE UNDERTAKING AND I NEED A PLANNING EFFORT AND HOPE THAT IT WILL ALSO INCLUDE THIS BROADER CONTEXT. AND AS AN EXAMPLE IN TIME BACK TO THE EARLIER CONVERSATION AROUND HOW MOBILE CRISIS TEAM BENEFIT CONNECTS TO NINE EIGHT EIGHT. I KNOW THAT THE 85% AFTER MAP WAS DESIGNED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPECIFICALLY FOR NINE EIGHT EIGHT AND YET WE HAVE. HAVEN'T SEEN THAT DIRECT CONNECTION REFLECTED IN DISCUSSIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WE FEEL THAT THE QUESTION SHOULD BE HOW DOES THE BENEFITS SUPPORT NINE EIGHT EIGHT AND NOT HOW DOES NINE EIGHT EIGHT INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BENEFIT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH YOU TO BUILD OFF THE TREMENDOUS WORK ACCOMPLISHED TODAY THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND. NOW LET'S GO. Q. HOW TO MISTER PETER RAGSDALE. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK VERY MUCH FOR UP TO DISCUSS- THE B. H. C. I. P. AND SHE'S SEEN RESTAURANTS AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- HOUSING AUTHORITY IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY- HAS BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY ON- WHAT HE'S YOU KNOW SORT OF A PRODUCTION FOCUSED- RELATIONSHIP TO PRODUCING ADDITIONAL HOUSING FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS. YOU KNOW WE TEND TO BE VERY PRODUCTION FOCUSED AND WALLER'S INTEREST IMPRESSIVE PROVIDERS AND PEOPLE WORKING IN THIS SPACE YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY THE SOLUTIONS ARE HOUSING WILL BOLSTER- THE OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT- YOUR SERVICE DELIVERY FOR INDIVIDUALS. WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. WHICH WAS TRUE WHAT MUCH OF WHAT HE'S IS BILL IS JERRY BY THE FINANCE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. UP FOR MISSION DRIVEN BUILDERS LIKE THE HOUSING AUTHORITY- HE WOULD RENT SUPPORTS THERE IS A NATIONAL CHALLENGE AMONG THE COST OF ACQUISITION CONSTRUCTION AND SERVICE DELIVERY. C. R. T. AND C. C. E. WOULD BE EXCITING OPPORTUNITIES FOR A MORE ROBUST HOUSING CONTINUUM. CURRENTLY THERE ARE OVER A HUNDRED FAMILIES AND SAMPSON COUNTY EVEN WITH RENTAL SUPPORTS CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR HOUSING THE INTENTIONALITY AROUND- BRINGING ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT SPECIAL NEEDS HOUSING FOR MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS. IS SORT OF A MODEL THAT WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN TAPPING INTO BUT I THINK THAT COULD BE EXPANDED WITH ADDITIONAL WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING. EXAMPLES OF LIKE NO PLACE LIKE HOME AND PROJECT ON HE REALLY CREATED IN SHORT ORDER OPPORTUNITIES TO PRODUCE AND INCREASE OUR HOUSING STOCK. FOR MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS. THERE HAS TO BE AN EXPANSION OF ALL TYPES OF HOUSING- THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES IN DESIGN AND- AVAILABILITY BUT- CERTAINLY CODE- AND COMMUNITIES HAVE TO. EMBRACE HOUSING OF ALL TYPES AND HOPEFULLY THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY WITH THESE- BROAD AND- DIFFERENT- HOUSING TYPES AVAILABLE WITH B. H. C. I. P. AND C. C. A. THERE COULD BE AGAIN A CHRISTIAN CHRISTOFFERSEN ET TO INCREASE PERMIT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WHICH ULTIMATELY WE BELIEVE. WE'LL HAVE A BETTER OUTCOMES FOR OUR MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS HAPPY ALSO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NIGHT I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANEL FOR TAKING TIME OUT OF YOUR DAY AND OFFER YOUR EXPERTISE AS FAR. AS WE'RE ENTERING THIS JOURNEY ALTOGETHER AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE ALL VOICES AT THE TABLE AS POSSIBLE- AND I AND I WILL SAY THAT'S THE KIND OF UNDERSCORES. ALL OF THIS CONVERSATION IS AROUND WORK FOR SO. YES WORKFORCE WORKFORCE WORKFORCE. AND AS I FEAR THAT WE'RE GONNA BE FIGHTING. FIGHTING HOUSING DOLLAR POACHING THE SAME POT I FEAR THAT WE'RE GONNA DO THAT WITH. OUR WORK FORCE AS WELL SO. I MEAN THAT'S FOR ANOTHER DAY TO TALK ABOUT BUT WE REALLY MUST. FOCUS ON ON ON HAVING THE WORK FORCE TO BE ABLE TO DO ALL THIS WORK THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- DOCTOR CASEY. MANAGEMENT DR QUEST I WANT TO ASK ABOUT. AND I INVENTED MR RAGSDALE AS WELL SO THIS NEW. TICKET SO YOU YOU HAVE SAID YOU'VE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE WAIT THERE'S A- HUGE NEED FOR MORE STEP DOWN HOUSING UP PEOPLE MOVE OUT OF IT AND KEEP CENTER. THEY GET WEAK AND YOU NEED A PLACE FOR THEM OFTEN TIMES AT LEAST RESTRICTIVE CENTER- DO YOU SEE. THAT THIS THAT THIS BRIDGE HOUSING IS GONNA ABLE WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO FIND. THE ROOMS AND THE FACILITIES. TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THIS. I DO BELIEVE WE IT I DO BELIEVE IT WHAT WILL BE HELPING US OUT YES- SO. WE DO DIFFERENT HOUSING THAN A LOT OF THE OTHER HOUSING INITIATIVES THAT FOCUSED ON PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. WORK WE'RE LOOKING FOR- SPECIALIZED HOUSING- SO- FOR EXAMPLE HOUSING. SO CRIMINAL BACKGROUND SO. THAT MIGHT HAVE RESULTED FROM HOPE HOMELESSNESS- MAKES- EMPLOYMENT AND ACCESS TO TREATMENT MORE CHALLENGING OVER THE LONG RUN- WE- NEED TO WORK WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS WE DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WITH LANDLORDS- IN ORDER TO- GIVE THEM ASSURANCES THAT WILL BE THERE WITH THEM TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT. ARE NEEDED FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AND SO WE ACTUALLY TYPICALLY LOOK FOR DIFFERENT DIFFERENT STOCK IF YOU WILL. THEN THE TYPICAL PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING- CONTACT SO BORED AND CARE FACILITIES AND TERM HOUSING PERMITS FOR HOUSING. BUT BUT THEN ALSO RECOVERY RESIDENCES- HOUSING FOR TRANSITION AGE USE. OTHER DIFFERENT CONTEXT AND SOME OF THE MORE TRADITIONAL- HOUSING. OPTIONS AND THOSE ARE AVAILABLE YOU JUST NEED THE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THE BEDS THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. THERE WE STILL HAVE TO WORK AT IT BUT YES WE'RE WE'RE ABLE TO FIND THOSE OPTIONS OKAY. AND THEN TO MISDIRECT STILL DOES THIS THIS IS A NEW PART OF MONEY TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW GET PEOPLE AT HOME SO WE CAN BETTER CARE FOR THEM AS YOU SAID. IT THIS WILL ALLOW YOU MORE FLEXIBILITY IS THAT CORRECT WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS BEFORE. WE SAY BUT WE'RE ALL WE'RE ALL FIGHTING FOR THAT SAME POT OF MONEY FOR IT FOR WITH THE HOUSING CREDITS AND EVERYTHING ELSE BUT THIS WILL BE MORE CLEAN DIRECTLY TO YOU IS THAT CORRECT. THAT'S DEFINITELY TRUE AND I THINK WHAT ALSO HAPPENS IN FOR THOSE OF US TO DO THIS WORK IT IS A LAYER CAKE OF FINANCING. TO GET ANY OF THESE PROJECTS- ACTUALLY. IN THE GROUND SO. I THINK YOU CAN STILL KEEP COUNTY- THERE'S A PROGRESSIVE HOUSING MODEL WHICH WHICH TALKS ABOUT YOUR HOUSING. BUT THERE HAS TO BE EXITS AS PEOPLE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR WITH THEIR TREATMENT PROGRAMS YOU KNOW WE STILL HAVE TO BE PRODUCTION FOCUSED. SO OUR COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BENEFITTED FROM A HUD PROGRAMS AS THOSE BONDS AND- THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HOPEFULLY WITH. WITH THIS LEGISLATION TO BRING RESOURCES. THAT ARE WILL ALSO MEET SOME OF THE GAPS IN BRINGING ADDITIONAL PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING ONLINE. SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- IT DOESN'T JUST HAVE TO BE THE TYPE OF HOUSING THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY BUILDING WITH- THE CAPITAL STACK FROM THE HOUSING PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. BUT ANY MOVE ANY MONEY THAT'S BROUGHT IN THAT WE CAN ADVOCATE FOR SPECIAL NEEDS CONSUMERS. I THINK IT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY OF A TRAUMA TO A BOX. TO INCREASE OUR HOUSING STOCK AND WE ARE IN A COMPETITIVE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT STATEWIDE. SO I SEE- DEDICATED DOLLARS AS AS AGAIN BENEFITING OUR COMMUNITY. TO INCREASE- UNITS FOR MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS. THANK YOU. A TIP. TO MAYBE. MISS RB OR- MISS COOK. AND BECAUSE BECAUSE- COMPUTERS OF THIS RIGHTS TALK ABOUT- YOU KNOW THAT OFTENTIMES PEOPLE COME INTO THE SYSTEM THROUGH A FIFTY ONE FIFTY WHICH IS OF COURSE A CRISIS AND IT'S TOO CUTE. HOWEVER WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF- S. A. Q. WAYS INTO OUR SYSTEM OFTENTIMES CAL AIM. I THINK ATTEMPTS TO DO THAT SO YEAH SO WE CAN TREAT CHRONIC ISSUES CHRONIC ISSUES AND NOT AS AS A CRISIS AND CUTE ISSUE- WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THAT DO YOU SEE CALLUM IS REALLY BEING ABLE TO MOVE US AWAY FROM THE ACUTE FIFTY ONE FIFTY CRISIS INTO THE MORE CARING FOR CHRONIC ISSUES. IT SAID REALLY COMPLEX QUESTION RIGHT- AND SO I'M VERY HOPEFUL. IT'S A COMPLEX QUESTION AND SO WE'RE VERY HOPEFUL THAT CAL AND WILL ALLOW US TO REALLY TRANSFORM THE DELIVERY SYSTEM I KNOW THAT SOUNDS BIG AND IN OUR- OFFICE RISTIC BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT I DO BELIEVE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INVESTED AND WE'RE YOU KNOW INVESTED IN AS WELL WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S CAPACITY- TO MAKE THE CHANGES INCLUDING THE TRANSFORMATION AND THAT'S WHY INVESTMENT IS NEEDED IN KEY AREAS. INCLUDED CRISIS SERVICES- SO ALSO PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION WE HAVE TO- INVEST ON THE FRONT END AS WELL SO THAT WE CAN REALLY STOP THE BLEEDING- SO WE REMAIN HOPEFUL- BUT I AGREE THERE DOES NEED TO BE MORE INVESTMENT- STRATEGICALLY IN ORDER. TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT WE ALL WANT. THANK YOU BECAUSE WHEN THE AN ADD ANYTHING TO THE MEAN SIMILAR SENTIMENTS IN TERMS OF THAT THE GOAL. AND I THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT DOES MENTAL HEALTH CRISES CRISES CAN BE PRECIPITATED BY ON THAT- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS OR HEALTH CARE NEITHER SOCIAL NEEDS. I THINK THOSE ARE THE TYPE OF THINGS THAT YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY THE UPSTREAM. INTERVENTIONS THAT CALENDAR GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON IN THE IN THE COORDINATION FOR HIGHEST NEED MEMBERS- WELL EVEN BETTER OUTCOMES THERE SO CERTAINLY I THINK THAT IS THE GOAL. THANK YOU DOCTOR PRINCE. THANK YOU- SO. I SHOULD QUESTION FOR WESTERN CENTER LAW POVERTY FIRST- IF YOU STARTED OFF YOUR TESTIMONY- BASICALLY EXPRESSING SOME SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE HEALTH PLANS BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS ACTUALLY THE COMMITTEE SUPPORTS AND THE- CORONATION OF KERR- DANCE CORONATION OF KERR- WHAT IS SO I GUESS I WONDER WHAT'S THE ALTERNATE BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE GOING DOWN THIS PATH SO HOW HOW WHAT KIND OF WHAT WAY WOULD YOU- WELL I GUESS WHAT WE SHOULD WE HOLD THE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE AND- WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU. MORE CONFIDENT PERHAPS THAT THE PLANS ARE ABLE TO CARRY OUT THE WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING OF THEM TELLING. THE QUESTION. WITH DAY DOES THE WHOLE CLAN FOR ACCOUNTABLE AND CONSIDERING THAT THE BIG TICKET INVESTMENTS THAT ARE GOING IN THROUGH INCREASED CAPITATION RATE THAT'S LOWER BENEFIT PAYMENTS THAT THERE BE ACT METRICS IN PLACE TO MEASURE THE ABILITY OF CLAMS. ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE INCLUDING FIVE CONTRACTING WITH SPECIFIC PROVIDERS THAT HAVE EXPERTISE IN SETTING ALONG THOSE LINES THE CRITERIA OF WHAT- PARTY- THOSE PROVIDERS ARE ABLE TO- PROVIDE THAT AS WELL THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL SERVERS NETWORK MEASURING INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE. ADDICTED TO YOUR- PREVIOUS POINT OF A NEXT INSURING THAT- THAT ARE ACTS IT CARRIED. OKAY SUPPORT ART OF FOCUS- ON THOUGH HAVE ARE BEEN RECEDING THAT BACK I DON'T HIGH UTILIZE YOURS BUT ALSO THE THAT. I WOULDN'T WANT BENEFIT THING CAN GROW ENERGY CHARACTER HOMELESS. OR I RECENTLY ENCOURAGED INDIVIDUALS. OKAY SO I GUESS I KNOW QUESTION FOR LOCAL HEALTH PLAN- YOU OR SAW SKIPPED- WE ALSO PREVIOUSLY YOU MAY EVEN IN I'LL% PLAY TO DISCUSS- THAT- CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE WERE ASKING. US HEALTH PLANS TO DO SOMETHING WITH SOMEONE NEW THAT'S- ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY HELP PLANTS HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW CORONATION CLINICAL CARE AND SOMEOF THOSE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES- THIS THIS MADE THIS IS PROBABLY A SOMEWHAT NEW AREA. TO KIKI AND YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOU'RE IMPLEMENTING THE ECM AND TO ME SERVICES BUT- IN THE TYPE OF ORGANIZATIONS AND FRANKLY I THINK WHEN I HEARD THE ANSWER FOR THE TYPES OF ORGANIZATIONS- THEY SOUND LIKE THE USUAL CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS USED TO WORKING WITH AND NOT AND NOT JUST FOR THIS LIFE FOR EXAMPLE. I MEAN I MEAN IF YOU'D SEE DOCTOR I KNOW R. F. KEYS OFTEN TIMES HAVE A LOT OF RELATIONS WITH THE COMMUNITY SO THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE WRONG PARTNER TO HAVE TO REACH COMMUNITY BUT- I GUESS BEYOND. THE. USUAL SUSPECTS I WOULD SAY- ARE. HOW PLANS DOING IN TERMS OF REALLY REACHING OUT TO COMMUNITY. TO PROVIDE THE CHICORY THESE COMMITTEE SUPPORTS- ALSO THE ENHANCED CARE MANGEMENT- DC HELP YEAH WHAT IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES FOR HEALTH PLANS TO DOING THAT- WHAT DO YOU SEE YOUR ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THAT SHOULD BE IN PLACE WE HEARD FROM LESSONS ARE LONG POVERTY- IT IS PLACE TO ENSURE THAT. THE PEACE COMMITTEE SUPPORTS AND THE ECM THAT DANCE CARE MANAGEMENT IS ACTUALLY REACHING. THE ENTIRETY OF THE PROBATE MEDIC COW POPULATIONS Y. SE PROPRIO YES I MEAN- THE- THE WHAT ONES THAT MAY HAVE LANGUAGE ACCESS. TO THEY HAVE OTHER ACCESS BARRIERS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE IN THE IN IN COMMUNITIES WHERE- PERHAPS THE COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE IS THAT. IT IS MORE IT LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY IT'S STRONG BUT INFORMAL SO IT'S NOT GOING TO BE YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND SOME ORGANIZATION THAT HAS A LOT OF FUNDS AND- ACCOUNTANTS WHO CAN SPREAD TO THE FINANCIALS BUT YET YOU NEED TO PARTNER WITH THEM IN CONTACT WITH THEM. YOU REALLY DON'T REACH THAT COMMUNITY SO WHAT DO YOU WHAT WHAT'S APPROACH OUR LOCAL HEALTH PLANS PLAN TO TAKE TO. TO INSURE THAT WE- THEY CAN CARRY OUT THE- ENHANCE CARE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE SERVICES. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION AND- THOUGH YOU'RE RIGHT MY REMARKS LARGELY FOCUSED ON THE EXISTING CONTRACT IN THAT THE NATIONAL COUPLE OF MONTHS OF CALAIS MENTAL MEDICATION THAT. REALLY DID LARGELY FOCUSED ON ENSURING CONTINUITY WITH WHOLE PERSON CARE AND THE MEMBERS. THAT WERE SERVED BY THE PILOT SO BY AND LARGE THOSE WERE COUNTY- ASKING AGENCIES WORK CORE PART OF HEALTH FROM PROVIDERS. THEY WANTED TO ENSURE THAT THOSE. SAME PROVIDERS WERE ALSO BROUGHT INTO CALAIS IN- THERE ARE EXISTING CONTRACTS WITH BETWEEN PLANS AND VIDEOS ALREADY. BUT I THINK THAT IS- AN AREA WHERE THAT WILL GROW OVER THE COMING MONTHS AND I THINK. YOU KNOW. THAT IS THE FOCUS OF- MANY OF THE METRICS IN THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM THAT WAS REFERENCED EARLIER. THERE ARE SPECIFIC MEASURES AROUND- YOU KNOW TRAINING AND BRING ON ADDITIONAL PROVIDERS AND PROVIDERS THAT REPRESENT THE COMMUNITIES THAT TEY LIVE IN. AND SO I THINK- I THINK THOSE. METRICS WILL REALLY SUPPORT BRINGING ON ADDITIONAL VIDEOS. SO THE QUESTION ON ABOUT WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES. I DO THINK PART OF THE REASON THAT THAT A CLAIM. IS THAT THESE ARE NOT TRADITIONAL. BETTER HALLER HELL CARE FOR- AND MANY OF THEM AS NEVER CALL. WITH EIGHT BEFORE SO I THINK SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OR THING THAT ARE TO GOING TO TIME TO WORK ON. IS REALLY FUN OF THAT THE CORE REQUIRE ARE BOTH EASY AND COMMUNITY. EVEN JUST FUNDAMENTALS OF CLAIM SUBMISSION AUSTIN YOU KNOW SURE THAT THAT'S NOT A BARRIER CLAIMS AND ENCOUNTERS. SOMETIMES THE STOPPER ARE EVEN- JUST ADMITTING- COCKFIGHT IN A SPREADSHEET AND INVOICING AND NOT WAIT BEFORE THEY CAN. GAIN THE CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO. CLEANING- EDUCATION HOW TO SECURELY HANDLE P. I- AND THEN ALSO JUST. THE FACT THAT THERE ARE SUCH ROBOTS REPORTING CHALLENGE THOUGH- I THINK THOSE ARE NOT INSURMOUNTABLE CHALLENGES BUT THEY'RE JUST GONNA TAKE TIME TO WORK THROUGH AND AGAIN I THINK THE DEFENDANT DOLLARS WILL BE INSTRUMENTAL THERE. SO I THINK THAT TOUCHES ON THE FIRST QUESTION AND THE SECOND YOU ASKED ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY. I GUESS I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT YOU KNOW THERE WAS A ROUTE EIGHT ACTIVITY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE CIRCULATED LAST FALL AND THAT WERE DRAFTED. AND THEY WERE THE STAKEHOLDER INPUT PROCESS INTO THAT AND NOW THOSE QUARTERLY REPORTING METRICS ARE ALL POSTED. ONLINE A WHAT PLANS WILL BE REPORTING ON A REGULAR BASIS IT EACH ASK AND THEN. I'D SAY YOU KNOW I HEARD FROM DOCTOR COOPER EARLIER ON. THAT THERE WILL BE DASHBOARD THAT WILL REGULARLY BE COLLECTED SO I DO THINK THE MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACE AND WE REALIZE THAT THE BIG HUGE LEFT IN THAT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ARE GOING TO BE A CRITICAL PART OF OUR SUCCESS. AND AGAIN IT'S JUST GOING TO TAKE TIME AND WORKING ON THAT. OKAY SO- IF YOU YOU DID MENTION THAT- CERTAINLY PEOPLE ARE FAMILIAR WITH FILLING CLAIMS AND THAT DOLE NEED TO LEARN. TO THE HUNT CLAIMS BUT- NO THE- FIVE I'M A PHYSICIAN WHO PRACTICES IN EFFECT IN BETWEEN CENTER IN YOUR WE HAVE ENTIRE BILLING TO. I AM ALSO SCHOOL PHYSICIAN I KNOW EVEN SCHOOLS WHICH ARE ACTUALLY LARGE BUREAUCRACIES IN THE CELLS OFTENTIMES CANNOT FIGURE OUT HOW TO FILE CLAIMS. WITH HEALTH PLANS- FERTILITY SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICES AND SO FORTH THEY'RE CHALLENGED- SO I AM A LITTLE NERVOUS WE SAY WHAT WE HAVE TO TEACH THEM HOW TO FILE CLAIMS BECAUSE I'LL TELL YOU FILING CLAIMS IS A PAIN IN THE NECK NINE AND I'M TRYING TO NOT USE OTHER LANGUAGE IN THIS PUBLIC FORUM SO- SO WHAT WHAT WHAT OUR PLANS GOING TO BE DOING AND I REALIZE THERE'S ALSO I MEAN THIS IS PERHAPS ALSO CONVERSATION FOR DTS TO BECAUSE- DID ON THE ON THE BILLING FINANCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY SIDE OUT SOCIAL KINDLY SIDE BUT- IT'S- I MEAN. DO YOU ARE YOU HAVE TO GO LOOK AT YOUR WHOLE CLAIMING PROCESS WHEN IT COMES TO THESE TYPES OF SERVICES SO WE DON'T. END UP. HAVING- COMMITTEE ORGANIZER. HAVING HAVE ENTIRE. DEPARTMENTS IN ORDER TO CLAIM FOR- IT'S THE END OF SPENDING MY MONEY ON OVERHEAD FOR THESE SERVICES. KNOWING HOW COMPLICATED AND- TIME CONSUMING AND BUREAUCRATIC CLAIMS PROCESSES HAVE BEEN. FOR I MEAN IT DOES. CAN WE TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THAT YEAH. SO I THINK YOU KNOW. A GOOD KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU KNOW IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR SMALL PROVIDERS THAT WERE CONTRACTED BAND HERE POINT- AND REALLY NOT YOU KNOW AN EASY PROCESS I THINK THAT I ALSO MENTIONED THAT THERE IS. A PROCESS BY WHICH PROVIDERS CAN FIT MANY MANUAL INVOICES- AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH OTHER SIGNIFICANT TRANSITION BEFORE IN MEDIC COW WHERE NONTRADITIONAL PROVIDERS ARE BROUGHT INTO MANAGED CARE NETWORK AND IT DIDN'T. AGAIN I DON'T THINK IT'S AN INSURMOUNTABLE PROBLEM AND WHEN I WAS TALKING WITH SOME OF THE LOCAL PLANS ABOUT KIND OF THEIR APPROACH DURING THAT TRANSITION I THINK THERE IS AN EFFORT TO HAVE AN APPROACH THAT'S NOT- YOU KNOW. THE INITIAL RESPONSE AND THEN DENYING A CLAIM BECAUSE IT'S NOT MEETING YOU KNOW ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE WORK WITH THE PROVIDER CAN BE SUCCESSFUL AND NOT ONLY DELIVERING. THE SERVICE TO GETTING PAID FOR IT. OKAY I HOPE YOU DID OUT OF IT FROM. TO I KNOW KNOW HOW TO MEET A SIMILAR CLAIMS TIGHTEN AUTUMN REJECTED DISMISSING THAT AGAIN BEFORE YOU GET PAID AND SEEM LIKE IT'S ALSO ALMOST AUTOMATIC. BUT I APPRECIATE THAT NO IT'S GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS IF WE MAKE IT TOO DIFFICULT. NO WE'RE NOT CONFINED COMMUTE ORGANIZATIONS AND THE OTHER ISSUE AGAIN AS I SAID. SOME OF THE COMMUNICATIONS YOU NEED TO WORK WITH ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO YOU KNOW THEY'RE- NOT REACH. MANY OF THEIR MEDICAL. COMMUNITY TO ME IS COVERED WITH THE SAME MEDICAL PATIENTS- MADE HIM A VERY INFORMAL ACTUALLY- YOU KNOW. IF YOU CAN GET SPREADSHEET THAT'S GREAT. SO BUT IF YOU DID BUT THEY THE ONES WHO CAN ACTUALLY REACH SO. I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING TO REALLY THINK ABOUT. HOW HOW WE'RE GOING TO REACH THOSE MUCH MORE INFORMAL ENTITIES. THAT CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE MANY SERVICES. THEN I GUESS THE- QUESTION FOR DISABILITY RIGHTS I MEAN YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE BARRIERS AND APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING UP LANGUAGE ACCESS BARRIERS. WHAT DO YOU SEE AS- F. AGAIN FOR CAL TEAM. IN TERMS OF FEATURE. THE POPULATION YOU REPRESENT ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE PROMISE OF CAL AIM IN TERMS OF THESE. COMMUNITY SUPPORTS AND- INDIANS CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES- WHAT DO YOU THINK PLAN SHOULD BE DOING TO REDUCE THE BARRIERS TO THE POPULATIONS THAT YOU REPRESENT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THIS IS JIM PETERSON AGAIN FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA- I THINK. WHAT WE SEE AND WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND THE TIME THAT I HAVE WORKS WITH CLIENTS LIVING WITH SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS IS THAT. THIS IS THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH REALLY BENEFIT FROM A FEW THINGS. THEY BENEFIT A LOT FROM HAVING LIKE A ONE STOP SHOP WHICH IS A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN GO GET THEIR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT GOT THEIR PHYSICAL HEALTH TREATMENTS AND NOT HAVE TO GO TO TOO MANY PHYSICAL LOCATION. BECAUSE A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR- YOU KNOW THEY'RE DEALING WITH TRANSPORTATION CHALLENGES OR THEY HAVE WORK OR THEY HAVE CHILDREN OR THEY HAVE OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES IN THEIR LIVES AND CAN'T STAND. ALL DAY GOING BACK AND FORTH TO MEDICAL OR SOCIAL SERVICES APPOINTMENTS- ANOTHER THING IS THAT. PEOPLE REALLY BENEFIT FROM SITE VISITS TO WHERE THEY LIVE OR WHERE THEY ARE OR OTHER PLACES IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE. THEY ARE COMFORTABLE ACCESSING SERVICES SO I THINK THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. FIGURING OUT HOW TO DESIGN THESE PROGRAMS AND WAYS ARE GOING TO BENEFIT THE PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE INTENDED TO BENEFIT I THINK THINKING ABOUT FLEXIBILITY AND HOW THE SERVICES ARE DELIVERED AND WHERE THEY'RE DELIVERED SHE IS REALLY IMPORTANT. IN ADDITION TO THAT- ISSUES THAT I TALK ABOUT REGARDING CULTURAL CULTURAL AND LANGUAGE ISSUES. WE TALK TO CLIENTS ALL THE TIME YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THEIR PROVIDERS BECAUSE THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND- BECAUSE OF THAT ARE NOT LIKELY TO STAY ENGAGED IN TREATMENT SO I THINK I'VE GOTTEN- GOING ON ABOUT THE ISSUES LIKE WORKFORCE AS EVERYONE ELSE HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHICH I REALLY APPRECIATE- THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME ATTENTION PAID TO DIVERSITY. OF THE WORKFORCE OUR RECORDING OKAY I APPRECIATE THANK YOU- SO WELL THIS IS OKAY AND AGAIN I WANNA THANK ALL OF THE PRESENTERS I KNOW THAT CENTER ADMIN COVERED A LOT OF GROUND SO- I JUST WANNA MAKE KNOWLEDGE AGAIN THE VERY IMPORTANT. THINGS THAT- THAT YOU'VE PRESENTED AND THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE PRESENT- I THINK THAT- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. AND SO VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT- BUT I THINK I'M I GUESS THE CHALLENGES- TO THINK BEYOND THAT LIKE ALL THE USUAL SUSPECTS. IS WERE TRYING TO REACH INTO THE COMMUNITIES ARE TRYING DRESS SOCIAL TERMS HEALTH AND SO FORTH. AND REALLY FIGURE OUT HOW WE MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE OUR PROCESS SEES TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN TO BUILD THAT CONTINUE OF CARE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TO ACTUALLY. BUILD THAT OUT ON THE ON THE SOCIAL SIDE TO DRAW SOCIAL TERMS OF HEALTH. AND SO I GUESS THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF THE CHALLENGE. FOR US AND THEN STATE NEEDS TO TRY TO. YOU KNOW THE- TRY TO MAKE THINGS. AT OUR END. IT IS ALWAYS A CHANCE- BUT THEN AT THE SAME TIME WE GO BE SURE- YOU- ARE I GUESS THAT THE ENEMY. ARE WELL AND TO TRY TO BUT BASICALLY YOU'RE THE YOU'RE YOUR INTERFACE WITH PEOPLE THE FRONT LINE. TO MAKE THINGS. SIMPLE FOR THEM AS SO- FIGURE OUT ITS SIMPLEST THAT NEEDS TO BE IN. TO IMPROVE ACCESS AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT- WE DON'T JUST TURN TO A THE USUAL SUSPECTS THAT THAT WE'RE USED TO WORKING WITH BUT FIGURE OUT HOW WE REACH OUT TO. PEOPLE WHO REALLY ARE CONNECTED TO THE COMMUNITY AND MAKE THAT SUCCESSFUL SO AGAIN WHAT I THINK THE. PANELS FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU. AND AGAIN. WE WITH REASON YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO EVERY DAY IN CALIFORNIA AND ESPECIALLY FOR TODAY DETECTING TIME OUT TO COME AND- TALK TO THE COMMITTEE. AS WE'RE HEARING. ABOUT OUR TRANSFORMATION- LEASES BUT PART OF. MEDICARE OKAY SO WITH THAT I THINK WILL MOVE ON THEN TO ISSUE NUMBER. EIGHT CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE IMPLEMENTATION. UPDATE YOUR MUTE DIRECTOR CORPORATE HELP THANK YOU YES IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT HAPPEN ONCE RIGHT IT HAS TO THANK YOU FOR FLAGGING. I SO WITH THIS INITIATIVE IT IS A MULTI YEAR INITIATIVE MULTI DEPARTMENT PACKAGE OF INVESTMENTS ARE YOU REALLY AIMING AT TRANSFORMING CALIFORNIA'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS. IN DONNELLY YOU KNOW FOR ALL CHILDREN- ZERO TO TWENTY FIVE REGARDLESS OF HERE- IT IS IT IS MEANT TO REALLY BE UPSTREAM OUGHT TO REALLY FOCUS ON ON GOING IN WITH A PREVENTATIVE LANDS. AND BUILDING AN ECOSYSTEM WHERE ALL CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS ARE IN EVERY TV SCREEN SUPPORTED SERVER- I KNOW FOR MERGING AND OUR EXISTING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. YOU KNOW I THINK WE ARE TRYING TO GROUND OURSELVES IN SOME PRINCIPLES REALLY FOCUSING ON EQUITY- CENTERING EFFORTS AROUND CHILDREN AND YOUTH VOICES STRENGTH NEEDS PRIORITIES EXPERIENCES. AND REALLY DRIVING TRANSFORMATIVE SYSTEM- CHANGES. AND USING ONGOING LEARNING AS A BASIS FOR CHANGE AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE OUTCOMES AS WE AS WE CONTINUE THROUGH THIS INITIATIVE- IT IS A LARGE SCALE EFFORT AS YOU KNOW- WHICH REQUIRES YOU KNOW VERY THOUGHTFUL AND PURPOSEFUL STEPS ARE TO ESTABLISH THE FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE PROGRESS- AND TO ALLOW FOR EFFECTIVE EXECUTION OF THE INITIATIVE- WE- ARE. YOU KNOW HAVE A MULTI YOURS YES WE ARE KIND OF APPROACHING IT IN KIND OF THREE DISTINCT PHASES OF THE DEPARTMENT BUT THE INITIATIVES THAT WE ARE. NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR- IT IN REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW WE ENGAGE IN THESE ACTIVITIES OVER KIND OF. THIS FIRST PHASE WHERE AND- YOU KNOW MAJOR FOCUS IS INCLUDED AROUND A DEFINING THE SPECIFIC GOALS THAT ARE ARE LINKING TO THE OVERALL KIND OF PLAN- WITH MULTIPLE DEPARTMENTS AND MORE MONTHS ON THAT SHE DID. YOU REALLY JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE I'M CONNECTING THOSE DOTS EARLY ENGAGING WITH OUR ART OUR SISTER DEPARTMENTS AND OF COURSE AGENCY- TO REALLY MAKE SURE WE ARE. BUILDING OUT THE BOX TOGETHER AND FINDING THOSE DEPENDENCIES ACROSS. THOSE INITIATIVES- REALLY STANDING UP A PERFORMANCE IN FIRST. I CAN STATE. IN REALLY PREPARE FOR KIND OF DETAIL LAN AND STATE DESIGN ITEM THAT CURRENTLY THE STATE THAT WERE IN. OUR RIGHT NOW THAT NEXT PHASE RALLY THE KIND OF DETAIL. DESIGN FOR FUTURE STATE- AND THEN LASTLY OF COURSE DELIVERING AN ACCELERATING- YOU KNOW THE FULL SCALE EFFORTS. IN IMPLEMENTING THEM AND THEN REFINING THEM OVER TIME SH THIS INITIATIVE IS LARGE AND IT WON'T NECESSARILY JUST BE SOMETHING THAT. GOES LIVE AS IT IS IN AND IS IT REFINED OVER TIME IT WILL HAVE TO BE CONTINUALLY REFINE THE DAYS IN. ADDITIONALLY THERE'S A NUMBER OF PIECES OF THE CHILDREN YOUTH THAT NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED BEFORE CERTAIN PARTS THAT THERE IS AN ORDER OF OPERATION. TO MAKE SURE IT'S SUCCESSFUL INCLUDING THAT WORKFORCE INFRASTRUCTURE PIECES- OF. EVIDENCE BASED GRANTS IN SCHOOLING BRIDGES YOU REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THOSE THOSE INFRASTRUCTURE ITEMS THAT HAVE LAID AN IMPLANTED. PRIOR Q. YOU KNOW VARIOUS OTHER LARGE SCALE STATEWIDE INITIATIVES THAT ARE PART OF THIS THIS ITEM. I THINK YOU KNOW GIVEN THE SCALE AND COMPLEXITY OF THIS TYPE OF AN EFFORT- STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT FOCUS FOR THIS FIRST YEAR HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THE ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY INCLUDES MULTIPLE GOALS- FROM KIND OF KEEPING STAKEHOLDERS INFORMED ABOUT THE INITIATIVES ARE GATHERING INPUT ON PRIORITIES- AND THE CURRENT DAYS TO KIND OF JOINTLY CO DESIGNED DENTAL SOLUTIONS WITH PARTNERS TO IMPLEMENT. THIS GOING FORWARD- THE ENGAGEMENT MODELS WILL BURY DEPENDING ON THE INITIATIVES- OF COURSE YOU KNOW HOW YOU APPROACH THE- VIRTUAL PLATFORMS CAN BE VERY DIFFERENT THAN EVIDENCE BASED- PIECES AND SO THERE ARE MULTIPLE. I KNOW STAKEHOLDER WORKSTREAMS AT. TAKING OFF AND- IN FACT THE ACS IS WITH AGE IN OUR SISTER. TO CONDUCT DEPLOY WHY. CHILDREN YOU'D BE HOW CHECK UP WHETHER ARE IN MAY MARCH- WHICH WILL BE- WILL HELP CUT OF STAR GAUGING X. NEEDY DOING IT. INTERNAL WORK AROUND- THIS- BUT CONTINUE TO ENGAGE IN START TO REALLY ROCK OUR ARMS ARE. THAT EXTERNALS TO. ENGAGEMENT TO WORK. A LOT OF DETAILS. DH WELL ALSO WATCHING NOT STATES ENGAGE STRATEGY AND EIGHT. INCLUDE LAUNCHING. A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TANK- AND CONDUCTING A SERIES OF ROUNDTABLE MEETINGS WITH KEY INFORMANTS ARE REALLY TO DRIVE IN AND START THAT ENGAGEMENT AT A DEEP LEVEL- THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO PROVIDE INPUT AS WELL SO EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT AT ALL OF THESE FORMAL- AS- INFORMING INTERVIEWS. WE WILL HAVE PUBLIC INPUT OPPORTUNITIES ALONG THE ENGAGEMENT AS WELL. AND SO NOW I'M KIND OF JUST GO THROUGH EACH OF THE INITIATIVE YOU WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE ARE PROVIDING AN UPDATE ACROSS THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT THE ACS IS LEADING. US TO KIND OF WALK THROUGH THOSE VARIOUS AREAS SO REGARDING THE SCHOOL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INCENTIVE PROGRAM. BETWEEN JULY TWENTY ONE IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWO DEC HAS CONDUCTED A VERY ROBUST STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT- AND EDUCATION BUT WITH BOTH HEALTH AND EDUCATION STAKEHOLDERS WE DEVELOPED METRICS- INTERVENTIONS. OUR GOALS ARE FOR THE DOLLARS AND DETERMINE THE PAYMENT STRUCTURE FOR THE MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR DH YES RECEIVED LETTERS OF INTENT FROM ALL MEDICARE MEDICARE PLANS ARE THAT THEY PLAN TO IMPLEMENT THIS INCENTIVE PROGRAM WHICH IS GREAT TO SEE. ADDITIONALLY PARTICIPATING MEDICAID MEDICARE PLANS I HAVE THATKIND OF PRE DEFINED GOALS AND METRICS- THEY WILL AS THEY NEED THOSE THOUGH THE RECEIVE THE PAYMENTS WERE ANTICIPATING RELEASING INCENTIVE HATED STARTING IN OCTOBER. OF THIS YEAR FOR THAT INITIATIVE. REGARDING THE SCHOOL LINK PARTNERSHIP AND CAPACITY GRANTS IDEAS YES- HAS JUST STARTED- OUR ENGAGEMENT WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS PARTICULAR ACTIVITY- AND ARE SEEKING VARIETY. OF INPUT ACROSS MULTIPLE SECTORS INCLUDING EDUCATION. AND WILL BE REALLY WRAPPING OUR ARMS AROUND THAT PARTICULAR PIECE- WE ARE REALLY FOCUSING ON GRANT DESIGN AN ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA TO START. BUT WE PLAN TO RELEASE THE GRAND THE FUNDING FOR THIS. TO FOLLOW OF TWENTY. YEAH PERIOD I THAT- THAT WOULD BE OPEN THROUGH DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR- WE ARE INTO HIS. PAIN WOULD BEGIN FLOWING IN EARLY TWO TWENTIES- AND GRANTS AND IT'S AN WILL ADMIN THROUGH A THIRD PARTY ACTIVELY WORKING TO YOU. BRING ON AT THIS TIME AS WELL SO WE'RE KIND OF BUILDING UP THAT INFRASTRUCTURE STARTING STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT TO DEFINE. THESE PIECES WITH THE HOPES OF GETTING THOSE GRANTS AND APPLICATIONS OUT BY THE END OF THE YEAR. REGARDING THE GRANTS TO KIND OF SCALE OF EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES IT'S A SIMILAR TIME LINE THAT YOU'D EXPECT. A REALLY FOCUSING ON STAKEHOLDERS THE FIRST THING THAT WE NEED TO DO IS ENGAGE THAT THINK TANK THAT I WAS MENTIONING TO COLLECT THE- EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SCALE UP THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AND REALLY MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE USING ROBUST EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTIVENESS. IMPACT ON RACIAL EQUITY ASSISTING ABILITY. IMPACT TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND SO I WILL BE FOCUSING FIRST ON THAT- AS WE EGAGE OUR STAKEHOLDERS WORK TAKING THAT OFF IN MARCH OF. THIS YEAR SO THAT'S RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER- WE WILL BE USING THAT AGAIN TO REALLY DEFINE ULTIMATELY WHICH EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES WILL DO HI WE WILL DESIGN- THOSE APPLICATIONS THEN- ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. AND THEN ROLLING THOSE OUT ON A SIMILAR FASHION ALL BY B. THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO HM IT'S GOING IN TWENTY THREE. ALSO WILL BE DONE BY A THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE STATEWIDE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH VIRTUAL SERVICES PLATFORM. AND E. CONSOLE PLATFORM BUT WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH PARTNERS TO COMPLETE A COMPREHENSIVE MARKET SKI ON ART AND LANDSCAPE ANALYSIS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL CAPABILITIES FOR THE SERVICE PLATFORM. BEGINNING IN APRIL OF TWENTY TWO AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE SUMMER IDA CS WILL CONVENE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE NATIONAL AND STATE LEVEL SUBJECT MATTER. EXPERTS ARE THROUGH MULTIPLE FORM MS TIPPED BUSINESS SERVICE BY TO LAUNCH THE BIRCH POP. AND YOU SALT- AND WE'RE STILL WORKING TO REALLY DID THE BEST. PROCUREMENT OF FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE PROCUREMENTS OR IF THERE WILL BE ONE- AND SO WE ARE CONTINUING TO DO THAT AS WE DIG INTO THAT- NATIONALS. ON A DH CSIS ON TRACK TO EMPLOYMENT DYADIC SERVICES AND JANUARY TWENTY THREE- AND REGARDING- THE CAL HOPE STUDENT SERVICES- THAT IS SUPPORTED IN THE INITIATIVE. REALLY THE GOAL HERE IS TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES OF PRACTICE IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY- OFFICES OF EDUCATION. TO REALLY ENHANCE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS I DH CS IN COLLABORATION WITH KEY PARTNERS IS ENGAGING USE OF PARTNERS AND CONTRIBUTING TO POSITIVE. SUPPORTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS THE DEPARTMENT'S GOALS TO HAVE CONTRACTS AT ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. BY JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND LASTLY REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SCHOOL LINKS A STATEWIDE FEE SCHEDULE IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDER NETWORK- DH CS WELL. I'M PARTNERSHIP WITH THE MHC ARE WILL BE DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING. A SCHOOLING STATEWIDE FEE SCHEDULE AND A STATEWIDE PROVIDER NETWORK OF SCHOOL SITE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COUNSELORS FOR OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH OR- SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT PROVIDED TO INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE AGE OF. TWENTY FIVE OF COURSE I'M STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT ON THIS WORKSTREAM WILL BEGIN SOMEWHERE AROUND APRIL OR MAY- AND- WE WOULD BE. YOU KNOW NOT IMPLEMENTING THIS INTEL COURSE LATER DOWN THE ROAD SO I JUST STARTED THOSE ENGAGEMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS. SHORTLY SO THAT IS THE CONCLUSION OF MY UPDATE ON HOW TO GET YOUR QUESTIONS THE TIME IS RIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT FINANCE ANYTHING. NOTICE COMMENTS ARE FINANCE THANKS THANK YOU EARLIER ANY ANY FOR COMMENTS ON THIS ISSUE OKAY THANK YOU- DIRECTOR. ON THE SCHOOL TO HEALTH. OF THOSE GRANTS ARE ALREADY OUT THE SERVICE ALREADY BEING PROVIDED DOES THAT CORRECT. I'M SO WE HAVE TO FINISH THE DESIGN ELEMENTS WITH THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP- AND THE WE'VE GIVEN ALL THE DIRECTION TO THE MANAGED CARE PLAN AND ALL MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE SAID THEY INTEND TO PARTICIPATE IN THE- THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM- BUT- LET ME JUST SEE IF WENDY HARRINGTON HAS ANY UPDATES IN REGARDS TO. A WIN ALL OF THAT WILL START ACTUALLY FLOWING. BUT WE ANTICIPATE THAT THAT WILL START FLOWING I BELIEVE IT IS OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS WHAT WE ANTICIPATE THE FUNDS WILL START FLOWING INTO THE MANAGED CARE PLANS FOR MEETING. THEIR METRICS. OKAY THANK YOU GOOD IF WE THAT I WAS FROM THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SO THAT'S THERE'S ALREADY THE MONEY'S ALREADY OUT THERE FOR THE PLANNING AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GRANTS CORRECT. YES SO WE'VE GIVEN THE DIRECTION IN REGARDS TO WHAT THEY HAVE TO SUBMIT THERE'S A THERE'S A KIND OF FEW MEASURES. SO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SUBMIT THEIR PLAN THERE'S A PAYMENT THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET METRICS ALONG THE WAY- AND SO THIS ONE IS WELL ON ITS WAY WE'VE DONE A LOT OF ENGAGEMENT WITH INDIVIDUALS HERE. AND HAPPY THAT EVERYBODY- PICKED UP THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM. OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN IN REGARDS TO THE- ADULT THE MOBILE. THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES INTO THE SUPPORT PLATFORM HOW WILL THAT I MEAN I UNDERSTAND WE'RE GOING TO GO OUT LOOK TO SEE IF SOMEBODY CAN DO THAT BUT HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT IT TIES BACK. TO OUR TO OUR NINE EIGHT EIGHT AND THE MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS. IT ACTUALLY HAD CONVERSATIONS AROUND THAT I THINK IT'LL DEFINITELY BE ONE OF THE PIECES THAT NEED TO BE DISCUSSED IN AGENCIES NINETY DAYS. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS TWO YEARS THIS WALL COURSE GET THE TABLE WITH THAT ARM BAR LEAVES INTERNALLY SHORT LEADING THE CHILDREN USE A WORKER ALSO VERY ENGAGED IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION I DON'T HAVE A DIRECT ANSWER FOR YOU YET BUT WE ARE TRACKING THE NEEDING CONNECTION THERE AND THE CODE AND SEE IF THOSE ITEMS. THAT'S I THINK IT'S IT IS EXCITING TO HAVE ALL KINDS OF NEW PROGRAMS AND IT'S ALSO. YOU KNOW I'M GLAD YOU'RE THERE TO BE EVERYONE FOR KEEPING TRACK OF ALL THIS MONEY AND THE OVERLAP ATTENTION OVERLAP. AND REDUNDANCY OF THE PROGRAMS AND THEN WE KNOW. THAT TAKES AWAY FROM ACTUAL DIRECT CLIENT CONTACT WHEN PEOPLE ARE JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THAT WHICH SYSTEM. THEY SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN. A DIRT PATH. THANK YOU AND- AND I KNOW WE HAD A CHANCE TO HEAR SOME OF THESE ELEMENTS. IN A PRIOR HEARING THAT- NOT WITH THE TEST BUT SOME OF THE OTHER AGENCIES SO- PATRICK BAGS COUPLE QUESTIONS SO ON THE DYADIC SERVICES- THERE WAS A PEDIATRICIAN OF COURSE SALE RIGHT NOW LET'S TAKE CARE OF I TAKE A CHILD BUT I KNOW THE FAMILY HAS A TREMENDOUS INFLUENCE- AND- FROM THE CHILD'S HEALTH CERTAINLY WE WORK WITH FAMILIES. D. HI HOW DO YOU SEE THAT ACT SERVICES WORKING WIND- WITH IT WITH PROVIDERS LIKE PEDIATRICIANS OR ARE WE ALLOWED TO BUILD IN FOR SERVICE FOR THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TO THE PARENTS. BUT YES SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF. ADDITIONAL CODES THAT WILL BE ROLLING OUT. RUSSIANS OF COURSE WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO ACT A BILL FOR THOSE SERVICES- THERE ARE CRITERIA FOR WHEN AND HOW YOU BUILD THOSE EVEN IF YOU'RE SEEING THAT THE CHILD FOR EXAMPLE BUT THAT- THAT YOU COORDINATION- THAT WORK IS WITH THE APPARENT ON WE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ISSUE A LOT OF- GUIDANCE IN DETAILS AROUND THIS HAPPY TO GET THAT TO YOU. A SENATOR PAN SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THAT- AND HAVE ANY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT'S NEEDED AS WELL YEAH BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS CHILD COMES INTO THE CLINIC THEY'RE REGISTERED RIGHT. WE'RE NOW SEEING THE CHILD WITH THE FAMILY AND THEN WE PROVIDE SERVICES THEN DO WE HAVE TO CHECK IN THE FAMILY. SO JUST TO BE SURE WE DO IT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT OVERLY COMPLICATED- IN TERMS OF WIND WINDSHIELD PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES- AND THEN. IN REGARDS. TO THE PLATFORM- SO I KNOW YOU GUYS A SO. AND THIS. WAS A- YEAH I MEAN THIS IS ONE OF THE CENTERPIECE. OF THIS INITIATIVE SOME AND ANYTIME WE'RE STARTING TO TALK ABOUT IT PLATFORMS- YOU KNOW LIKE TO AVOID ANY PROBLEMS- SO. I MEAN ARE WE LOOK AT I KNOW YOU'RE GATHERING INFO AND SO FORTH BUT I MEAN IT IS THE INTENTION TO GO TO A CONTRACTOR AND BUILD THIS THING FROM GROUND UP YEAH- WE ARE THEIR EXISTING PLATFORMS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT HAVE BEEN READY USE UNTESTED. THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT POTENTIALLY LICENSING I GUESS- YES OF IT DEFINITELY WOULD BE THE LATTER WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BUILD SOMETHING FROM SCRATCH- IT'S NOT TECHNICALLY AN IT PROJECT WE ARE GOING TO PROCURE SOMEONE ELSE'S SYSTEM I JUST TO BE CLEAR THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING THAT NATIONAL STAND WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE ENTITIES TO DO. THIS TODAY- OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DONE IT OTHER STATES HAVE WATCH SIMILAR PIECES WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT NATIONAL SCANS SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE VARIOUS SERVICES OUT THERE WILL NEED ALL OF OUR NEEDS OR DO WE NEED TO DO- AN INTEGRATED MODEL WHERE WE'RE KIND OF PULLING A FEW PIECES OR IS THERE A VENDOR WHO CAN. MEET ALLOF OUR NEEDS WITH DIFFERENT MODULES AND SO THAT'S CURRENTLY THE RESEARCH THAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW- IN INTERVIEWING AND HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH- SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IN THIS SPACE- AND SO- YOU DON'T HAVE A DIRECT ANSWER RIGHT NOW BUT THAT'S THE EXACT TYPE OF REVIEW THAT WE ARE DOING COMPREHENSIVELY ACROSS ACROSS THE NATION RIGHT NOW AND I'VE ASKED THIS BEFORE BUT IT BE HELPFUL IN THIS NON TERMS OF WHICH WHEN YOU GOT A LICENSE OR SOMETHING BUT- IF YOU'RE DOING THIS AGAIN SAYING THAT. THESE ARE THE EXISTING PROGRAMS ARE OUT THERE THAT AT LEAST TWO WERE YOU KNOW WE THINK ARE EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO RIGHT NOW WHETHER YOU END UP LICENSING THAT ONE OR SOMETHING ELSE OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT'S THAT'S A DIFFERENT ISSUE. BECAUSE WE ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT THIS PLATFORM WE SEE THE PLATFORM IS GOING TO DO X. Y. AND Z. BUT IT BE HELPFUL TO SAY OKAY IN OUR SKIN. THIS IS THIS IS WHAT WE'RE KIND OF LOOKING AT YOU KNOW THAT IT'S LIKE OKAY WE HAD THERE'S A PLATFORM OUT AND YOU KNOW THIS STATE OR THIS COUNTRY THAT DOES THIS AND SO. THIS IS SOMETHING THIS IS AN EXAMPLE. OF HOW IT CAN BE DONE. AND HOW WELL IT'S WORKED EIGHT. THE IT IS SO IT'S A OF FEEL THE LITTLE NEBULOUS OUT THERE. ABOUT THESE. WHAT IT. GOING TO ME WE HAVE A DISK. OF TO THINGS IT'S POTENTIALLY GOING TO DO BUT IT'S ANXIOUS ABOUT SO. YOU KNOW WE HAVE TESTED. EXAMPLES THAT SHOWS THAT WE CAN DO THIS AND HOW WELL DO THEY ACTUALLY WORK. AS WAS WERE ABOUT TO. YOU KNOW AT LEAST- BUDGETED TO SPEND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ON THIS. SO IT'S A BIG CHUNK OF MONEY- AND AS I THINK KELLY IS SO YOU'RE DOING THE SCAN AGAIN THIS IS NOT TRYING TO. GUESS WHO YOU'RE FINALLY GOT A LICENSE BUT JUST- LIKE HEY WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES YOU CAN SHARE WITH US TO SAY. THAT THE GIVE US A MORE CONCRETE EXAMPLES. OF WHAT YOU'RE HOPING THE PLATFORMS IT IS ABLE TO DO WITH IT WITH THIS TEST WITH AN EXAMPLE THAT ACTUALLY. HAS DEMONSTRATED- IT WORKS. YES THE WE BACK. ALSO LOOKED. AND AUSTRIA. HAVE A GOOD MODELS OUT THERE WE ACTUALLY MET WITH CANADA- AND WHAT THEY PUT UP- I. HAVE LEARNED A LOT FROM THEM. I THINK. OUR CURRENT SCHEDULES THERE'S ABOUT OVER YOU KNOW TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT PLATFORMS TO DATE- AND WE ARE CURRENTLY CATEGORIZING THOSE BY CAPABILITY- WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON ONES THAT ARE FOCUSED ON CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND NOT. ALL OF THE PLATFORMS HAVE A HISTORY OF. OF THAT INTERSECTION AND SO AGREE WITH YOU WE WANT TO LEARN FROM OTHERS WHO HAVE DONE THIS ALREADY. ARE WE ONE OF THAT THOSE PIECES AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO ENGAGE- ON ON THOSE. CONVERSATIONS OKAY AND I THINK IF YOU'RE TRYING TO. START IDENTIFYING WHICH PLATFORMS I PRESUME YOU'RE ENGAGING. LIKE THE PART TECHNOLOGY AND OTHERS WHO. YOU HAVE THE EXPERTISE IN THE MENTAL HEALTH AND PERHAPS SYSTEMS OF CARE. ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE TO BE SURE WE HAVE A PLATFORM THAT GROWS. AND EVOLVES AND DOESN'T THAT. THE IT JUST GET OUT YOU. THIS FIX AND GETS OUT DATE I AGREE IT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST THERE WILL THERE WILL BE PHASES TO THE IMPLEMENTATION THERE WILL BE NEW YOU KNOW FUNCTIONS THAT WILL COME OUT LATER WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE A MINIMUM SET OF PIECES BUT WE AGREE WITH YOU THIS IS AN EVOLUTION WHERE WE WILL HAVE TO. CONTINUALLY BE EVOLVING AND LOOKING AT WHAT IT OFFERS- AND SO YOU KNOW WE ARE APPROACHING IT WITH THAT SAME FRAME OF MIND AS YOU ARE YOUR REFERENCE AND THEN OF COURSE- IT USUALLY WHEN IT SYSTEMS DON'T WORK IT'S ACTUALLY HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT. THIS WITH THE SYSTEM SO AND- THE END USERS FIND THAT THE SYSTEM IS NOT VERY FUNCTIONAL FOR THEM SO- WELL TO FIGURE OUT SO HOPEFULLY YOU ARE ALSO AND HOW IS THIS STILL FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD BUT- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ENGAGE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO INTERFACE WITH THE SYSTEM WHETHER IT'S- PLANS ARE PROVIDERS ARE. PATIENTS OR PATIENTS FAMILIES AT CETERA TO BE SURE THAT THIS. THIS PLATFORM. IT IS THE DAY OF THE INTERFACES ARE ONES THAT- AND MAKE IT YOU KNOW. D. EASY ENOUGH TO USE AND IS INVITING FOR PEOPLE TO USE OTHERWISE. HELLO TO OUR PLATFORM THAT NO ONE USES ENGAGING WITH- WITH CHILDREN YOUTH FAMILIES TO BE. END USER I. TESTING FOR US AND INPUT FROM BOTH THE BEGINNING DESIGN PROCESS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE VIRTUAL PLATFORM BUILD THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE- USEFUL AND HELPFUL FOR THEM AND THAT WE WORK OUT SOME OF THOSE- JINX- YOU KNOW WITH THEIR ODD YOU KNOW FRAME OF MIND AT AT THE CORE FOCUS OF WHAT WE'RE DOING SO WE AGREE. WITH WITH THAT SENTIMENT OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL AS I SAID THIS IS THE I MEAN THIS PLATFORM IS A MAJOR INVESTMENTS- THERE'S BEEN A LOT PROMISED FOR THE PLATFORM- AT EIGHT EIGHT AM.  LITTLE NERVOUS ABOUT THAT- IN THE SENSE THAT I JUST WANNA BE SURE WE'RE NOT OVER. COMMITTING TO- DESCENDED PLATFORM'S GONNA SOLVE ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROBLEMS WHICH I KNOW YOU'RE NOT. SAYING NECESSARILY BUT I THINK WE NEED TO SET APPROPRIATE EXPECTATIONS FOR WHAT WE CAN GET FROM THE PLATFORM. PLAY BUT- I UNDERSTAND THE PLATFORM IS SUPPOSED TO TRY TO PULL THINKING ON THAT THINGS TOGETHER. AND AND I THINK IT'S GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO SET THE APPROPRIATE EXPECTATIONS AND CERTAINLY- UNFORTUNATELY I THINK FOR IT PROJECTS I DON'T KNOW I MENTIONED THAT TO. THANKS THE FOR THE DETAILS IT PRIDE AS WHEN THEY WORK WELL THEY DON'T MAKE THE NEWS ON THIS DON'T WORK THAT'S WHEN THEY MAKE THE NEWS. AND SO. WE'D LIKE THIS TO NOT MAKE THE NEWS BUT WE WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW ABOUT IT LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY. THANK YOU I AGREE THOSE ARE GREAT PRINCIPLES TO EMBRACE WITH. HIS PROJECT- AND WE AGREE WE DON'T WANT TO OVER PROMISE YOUR I THINK THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO DO THIS AND- WE'RE TRYING TO TREAD LIGHTLY BEFORE WE REALLY KIND OF. OUTLINE FOR PEOPLE EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN IN THE SYSTEM AND WHAT IT CAN DO. IT AND REALLY TRY TO. LAY OUT A ROAD MAP OF WHAT IT COULD LOOK LIKE- OVER MULTIPLE YEARS OF VARIOUS FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES BEING ADDED TO IT AND SO. ON WE AGREE WITH THAT AND THAT IS HOW WE WILL BE APPROACHING AT NIGHT AND I THINK THAT CAN BE HARD FOR PEOPLE BECAUSE THAT. IT'S EXCITING IT'S A IT'S A GREAT NEW OPPORTUNITY IT'S A LARGE INVESTMENT AS YOU'RE MENTIONING. BUT WE DO NEED TO BE THOUGHTFUL WE DO NEED TO BUILD IT RIGHT AND THAT DOES TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME IS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO THAT DUE DILIGENCE ON THE UP FRONT PART. I HAD TO DO THE BEST. YOU CAN. OKAY THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU VERY. LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER NINE FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL FOR ALL. ADULTS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS CALIFORNIA HAS EXPANDED MEDICAID COVERAGE TO CHILDREN YOUNG ADULTS AND OLDER ADULTS AGE FIFTY AND OVER REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. THE BUDGET BUILDS ON THOSE EXPANSION AND INCLUDES EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINETEEN MILLION. SIX HUNDRED THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND- IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AND TWO POINT THREE BILLION A ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION GENERAL FUND ANNUALLY OUT FULL IMPLEMENTATION. EXPAND FULL SCOPE ELIGIBILITY TO ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE ADULTS AGE TWENTY SIX THIRTY FORTY NINE REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS IS TO BE BEGINNING NO SOONER THAN JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. BY REMOVING A BARRIER TO HELP ACCESS DUE TO IMMIGRATION STATUS THIS PROPOSAL WHICH PROVIDES COVERAGE TO THE REMAINING AGE GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT AN EYE DOCTOR. AND SATISFACTORY IMMIGRATION STATUS WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL LOW INCOME CALIFORNIA DOGS HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS. TO COMPREHENSIVE AND AFFORDABLE CARE. WE KNOW ECHO SO TO HEALTH OUTCOMES FINANCIAL SECURITY AND WORKER PRODUCTIVITY. WE ARE PROPOSING A JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- START DATE TO ENSURE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION. THIS EXPANSION WILL ADD APPROXIMATELY. SEVEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN THOUSAND. ADDITIONAL MEDICARE ENROLLEES AND IS ONE OF THE LARGEST EXPANSION OF MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY IN RECENT YEARS. AS SUCH THIS TRANSITION WILL REQUIRE EXTENSIVE COORDINATION BETWEEN DH CS. COUNTY PARTNERS MANAGED CARE PLANS AND STAKEHOLDERS- WE NEED TO DO DEVELOPMENT OF POLICY GUIDANCE AND NOTICES FOR AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS TO INFORM. THEM OF THE INSPECT EXPANSION. I INFORMATION TO THOSE ENROLLED IN TRANSITION TO FULL SCOPE COVERAGE WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT MEDICAL RATES AND MANAGED CARE PLAN NETWORK ADEQUACY REQUIREMENTS ARE APPROPRIATELY ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THEIR BROKE INTERNAL MEANT OF THESE ADDITIONAL MEDIC HOW- ENROLLEES. BETWEEN NOW AND JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR MANY SIGNIFICANT POLICY INVESTMENTS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED RELATIVE TO MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY INCLUDING RESUMING THE ELIGIBILITY READ DETERMINATIONS DUE TO THE END OF THE FEDERAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. EXPANSION OF MEDICARE TO ABOUT A HUNDRED AND NINETY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND OLDER ADULTS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. ELIMINATION OF THE MEDICAL ASPECT TEST- FEES ONE HUNDRED BAGS RAISING DOUBTS THAT LIMIT YEAH UNDER THIRTY THOUSAND EFFECTIVE JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. CONSOLIDATION OF COUNTY ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS INTO ONE STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WELFARE SYSTEM OUR SIZE AS REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THAT MIGRATION IS TO BEGIN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ZERO. I AND AS A RESULT THE SALT WILL BE IN A STATE OF TREES WERE THEY CANNOT MAKE ANY PROGRAM CHANGES UNTIL THEY FULLY MIGRATE TO CAL STAR. IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE. I THIS PROPOSAL CANNOT BE PHASED IN BY GROUP AT EACH PHASE ESSENTIALLY EQUATES THE SAME LEVEL OF EFFORT BOTH RIPPON AND FIRST. OF THE FULL I. PROPOSAL THAT WOULD BE IT COULD CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF THESE POLICY CHANGES AND SYSTEM CHANGES NECESSARY STATES THE PROPOSED START DATE OF JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. I CONCLUDE MY PRESENTATION. THANK YOU A DIFFERENT FINANCE. NOTHING ELSE TO ADD GREAT HELLO. THANK YOU MOREOVER THE ALLEGED ANALYST OFFICE- BASICALLY MINISTRATIONS AT ESTIMATES THE PROPOSAL WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED CALIFORNIANS. THE MINISTER IS FOR THIS EXPANSION ALONG WITH THE EXPANSION FOR UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS AGE FIFTY AND OLDER WHICH WAS APPROVED LAST YEAR WE ROUGHLY ESTIMATE THAT THE UNINSURED POPULATION STATE REDUCED BY ABOUT ONE MILLION PEOPLE WHICH IS ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE UNINSURED POPULATION. WE DO WANT TO RAISE A FEW ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION REGARDING THIS PROPOSAL- FIRST WE ARE CONTINUED EVALUATING ESTIMATE KEYSTONE COST I KNOW THAT ANY SUCH. EXPANSION ON ITS SUBJECT TO CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY INSIDE THE ACTUAL CASE LOADING COSTS COULD BE DIFFERENT. SECOND WE WANT TO KNOW THAT EXTENDED TIME FRAME TO EXPANSION IN ACCESS TO COME. YOUR IMPLEMENTATION TIME FRAME SOME TO POP EXPERIENCE COULD IMPROVE OUR TO HEALTH CARE SOON FRAME COULD BE PARTICULARLY. FOR PEOPLE WHO WOULD AGE OUT OF FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL IF THEY TURN TWENTY SIX PRIOR TO GENERATE ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IT'S SUCH CASES THESE INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE SHIFTED. TO LIMITED SCOPE MEDI CAL AND THEN WE MOVED ACK TO FULL STOP AFTER JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR BECAUSE OF THE LAPSE IN COVERAGE WE ESTIMATE THAT ROUGHLY FORTY THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED YOUNG ADULTS WHO CURRENTLY HAVE FULL COVERAGE WOULD LOSE THEIR COVERAGE AS A RESULT OF THIS. PRIOR TO JANUARY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- THIS NUMBER TO WE HIDE. DUE TO. THE FEDERAL. POLICY DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT EFFECTIVELY PROHIBITS TERMINATING. ELIGIBILITY WHILE THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IS IN FACT A COUPLE MINUTES CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS A LOT UNDER NOT GOING YOUNG AND OLD ENJOY TWENTY AND WHAT IT MUST COVER DURING THE CALL A COUPLE TREE TANK- MINISTRATION NOTED THERE WOULD BE CHALLENGES- TO AN EARLIER EXPANSION AND WE RECOGNIZE THESE CHALLENGES ARE VERY REAL- HOWEVER WE THINK THAT A MORE INCREMENTAL APPROACH COULD EXPAND COVERAGE FASTER OR- WITH MORE MANAGEABLE. MANAGEABLE WORKLOAD IN HOT BEEN DOING A FULL EXPANSION SOONER. FOR EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD TAKE STEPS TO PREVENT THE LOSS OF CUB FOODS GO COVERAGE OF PEOPLE WHO AGE OUT OF COVERAGE PRIOR TO JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. IT WOULD BE HAPPY TO DISCUSS POTENTIAL WAYS THIS COULD BE DONE WITH THE LEAD CHANGING THE MINISTRATION- SUCH AS BY A CONTINUING TO- NOT TO ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS. FOR THE IMPACT OF COPULATION. WE WERE. I'M NOT EXCEPT. ISN'T IN INDORE AN EX. TIMELINE FOR ALL OF THE- IN BY THE PROPOSED. BUT THERE. CHURCH ABROAD INFORMATION FEES AND ADMINISTRATOR COSTS AND K. OF AN ABOUT. AN ALTERNATIVE MENTAL APPROACH. AND THAT THESE POTENTIAL. COULD NOT KNOW SO NEEDING THE ALL RAISED. TWO AVERAGE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WILL JUST SAY I THINK THE LEGISLATURE VERY- INVESTED IN THIS IS IN- WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE IT HAPPEN SOONER THAN LATER SO I WOULD I WOULD ASK- DIRECT BOSS IF YOU COULD. LOOK AT- SOME OF THE SUGGESTIONS AT THE LA- MADE ABOUT GETTING THIS EXPEDITED- AND THEN PRESENTING THAT TO US AT THE LITTLE BIT LATER DATE. AT THAT IF WE CAN DO IT OR NOT. OUR DEFENSE. YEAH I- FULLY AGREE AND I GUESS THAT THAT AND THAT'S OBVIOUS RECORD ACTUALLY- DIRECTOR BUS YOU MENTIONED THAT IN THE TRANSITION. FOR MEDICAL INTO SAWS THAT. IT CAN REMIND ME WHICH WHICH WHAT THEY HEARD WAS THAT WHAT HAPPENED A TIED TAKES OVER THE HELLO OVER A WHOLE YEAR OR SOMETHING WHERE WE BASICALLY SAID WE CAN'T MAKE ANY ELIGIBILITY CHANGES AT ALL. BECAUSE OF THE TRANSITION THAT I HEAR THAT CORRECTLY THE MIGRATION- GRACIOUS. NEAR ME MMHM YES YES THE MIGRATION BEGINS AT. OVER TWENTY TWENTY- AND AS A RESULT I'M SAHGAL BEING ESSENTIALLY STATED FREEZE- OR PROGRAM CHANGES CANNOT BE MADE UNTIL WE'RE FULLY MIGRATED CALZADA IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE. OKAY SO THIS. COOKBOOK I MEAN THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW NOT ONLY FOR THIS FOR A LOT OF OTHER THNGS SO. YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THE MIGRATION- AND AGAIN I KNOW YOU'RE DHS DIRECTOR SO I DON'T KNOW IF OTHER PROGRAMS ALSO GET AFFECTED AS WELL. SO I THINK IT'S FUN FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THAT- ETWEEN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO OCTOBER TWENTY THREE THERE CAN'T BE ANY CHANGES SO WHILE YOU'RE DOING THE MIGRATION OF THE- I WOULD DEFINITELY DEFER TO THAT- OFF THE SYSTEM INTEGRATION IN THE SAAS PROJECT- THE SPECIFICS BUT THERE ARE WAYS THAT FROM THAT TIME LINES OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO YOU AT YEAH AT FIRST OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND THERE ARE WAVES. OF PHASES IN OVER THE COUNTIES- AND SO I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING TRYING TO LIMIT ANY CHANGES THROUGH THAT THAT YOUR PUREED CHIP ENSURE STABILITY OF THE OF THE HOUSE IS DOWN OKAY ALL RIGHT THAT'S WHERE I PAY LESS ATTENTION TO IT SYSTEMS. JUST LIKE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PLATFORM BEFORE OKAY SO I THINK YOU'D BE GOOD TO GET CLARITY ON THAT BECAUSE AS WE'RE HEARING NOT ONLY OF COURSE YOUR AGENCY BUT OTHERS- I THINK WE NEED CLARITY AS TO- WAS OR MAKE. POLICY TO. WERE WE'RE ABLE TO DO NOT BECAUSE OF THESE TECHNICAL ISSUES AND I GUESS THE OHER QUESTION THOUGH IS IT AS MUCH AS IT'S NOT IDEAL- MAKE A POLICY CHANGE ARE THERE. WELL YOU DON'T WANT TO DESTABILIZE THE COMPUTERS AND IT AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS BUT OVER A WHOLE YEAR- YOU KNOW THERE ARE THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN RIGHT. BECAUSE IT'S NOT DONE THAT OTHER THINGS MAY HAPPEN AND SO FORTH WHERE WE NEED TO HAVE A POLICY RESPONSE. AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT- THEY'RE GOING TO BE. I MEAN WE CAN'T TELL PEOPLE WELL BECAUSE OUR COMPUTERS MOVING WE CAN'T HELP YOU. SO IS I MEAN I THINK PART OF IT'S ALSO GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT LIKE WHAT ARE THE WORKAROUNDS ARE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE. IF WE DO HAVE TO MAKE AN URGENT POLICY CHANGE- WELL THEY COULD COME. SAYS MAY ME NOT BE ABLE TO. I MEAN THAT. DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT- TO SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL. BUT. I DON'T WANT TO- YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE SUFFER FOR YOU BECAUSE- BECAUSE- BECAUSE WE CAN'T RESPOND. SO SO BUT THAT WOULD ALSO MAKE NOTE IT'S A THIS IS- IT'S FEBRUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE STILL HAVE. SEVEN MONTHS BEFORE. THE SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND- WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT WHAT THINGS WE NEED TO. PUT IN PLACE THAT WE CAN PUT IN PLACE TO PERHAPS MOVE TRANSITIONS FASTER. BEFORE WE GET INTO THIS- TECHNICAL WINDOW. AS WELL AS WELL SO- WE ARE INSTANTLY WE HAVE THIS THIS IS A THIS EXPANSION IS. NOT AND OF COURSE I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT'S EASY. BECAUSE I'M NOT THE ONE WHO HAS TO DO THE WORK BUT IT'S PRETTY MUCH UNPARALLELED LOOK SOMETHING WE'VE DONE BEFORE EIGHT WERE YOU DOING IT FOR THE OVER. SIX WE ALWAYS VERY KIND OF FOR THE- SO WE WOULD THINK THAT AT LEAST WE'RE NOT ASKING. THE AGENCY TO DO SOMETHING BRAND NEW. THE QUESTION IS CAN IS THERE A WAY WE CAN DO IT. MORE QUICKLY IN A WAY THAT- IF THERE'S A TECHNICAL WINDOW THAT WE HAVE TO AVOID. THIS IS THERE A WAY WE CAN SET OF SYSTEMS. THAT CAN- THE- THAT CAN BECOME. BEFORE THE- WINDOW. DOWN I GUESS BEGINS. I WOULD JUST NOTE THIS EXPANSION THREE TIMES WHAT WE WILL BE IMPLEMENTING AND- AND MADE HER OLDER DAUGHTER EXPANSION SO THERE'S ALSO NETWORK ADEQUACY AND READ- CONVERSATIONS THAT WOULD NEED TO HAPPEN I'M IN ADDITION TO THE SYSTEM CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED YEAH WELL IT'S THIS WAY- YOU KNOW CAN WE GET THE SYSTEM STUFF AND I REALIZE THAT USUALLY YOU DO THE SYSTEMS AFTER YOU HAVE THE AGREEMENTS BUT I MEAN IF THEY THINK. YEAH WELL I THINK THE GOVERNOR FOR PUTTING THIS FORWARD AND REALLY APPRECIATED BUT I ALSO KNOW THERE'S A TREMENDOUS DEMAND FOR HEALTH CARE RIGHT NOW PARTICULARLY WITH A PANDEMIC GOING ON- I REALIZE THAT- THERE'S OTHERS THAT BUT THERE'S A TECHNICAL PROBLEM IS THERE A WAY TO AT LEAST GET. THE TECHNICAL STUFF TEED UP- SO TO PREVENT THE PEOPLE THEY- SET. AND THEN- THEN I DON'T WANT TO GET SOUND SIMPLER THAN IT ACTUALLY IS- IT AND THEN THINK ABOUT LIKE WHAT THIS FATHER AGREEMENTS NEED TO BE MADE TO FINALIZE THIS- SO. ALL RIGHT. I'M SURE YOU'LL TRY YOUR BEST BUT I THINK WE'RE INTERESTED TRYING TO MOVE THIS UP. SENATOR NOT. I SEE THE EARLIER WITH HIS HAND UP PLEASE GO AHEAD. ON THE AMERICAN ON SO. FINAL MORE CONTACTS REGARDING THE COUNCIL'S IMPLEMENTATION IT'S EIGHTEEN COUNTIES THAT WOULD BE MOVED- INTO CAL SOLACE BETWEEN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE- IN TERMS OF THAT FREEZE IT WOULD NECESSARILY MEAN THAT CHANGES COULD HAPPEN DURING THAT TIME PERIOD HOWEVER IT WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN THE NEED TO PROCESS THOSE CHANGES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS SO ANY CASE STUDY IN HOW TO MAKE THE POLICY CHANGE MAY BE DONE MANUALLY. THIS COULD CREATE- NOT ONLY ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD BUT RISKS IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT INFORMATION IS ENTERED CORRECTLY INTO THE SYSTEM- LATER ON THE INTERNET TRANSITION BY THE WAY THAT SINCERITY SINCE YOU'RE EXPLAINED YEP THAT'S TAKING PLACE OVER A YEAR IS THAT BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT FORTY EIGHTEEN COUNTY IS IT JUST THAT BETWEEN THE WHOLE YEARS IT BECAUSE OVER THE YEARS CERTAIN COUNTIES WILL BE AT CERTAIN POINTS IN. THE COUNTIES OF THE OTHER POINTS RIGHT- I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT WILL BUY A YEAR OUR OUR A YEAR BECAUSE IT WE DO THIS COUNTY FOR THE NEXT COUNTY THE NEXT AND SO REALLY. YEAH HE SAID THIS IS THE SO I WOULD SAY. PERHAPS IS IN AGAIN YOU KNOW I SAID DON'T MAKE IT SOUND EASIER THAN IT IS- BUT- THEN. TECHNOLOGY THAT MAYBE CAN WE DO THIS ON A ROLLING I MEAN IDEALLY YES WE JUST DO ACROSS THE STATE THE SAME TIME BUT IF WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS AND WE KNOW IT'S EIGHTEEN COUNTIES AND THEREFORE WE HAVE OTHER COUNTIES THAT. WE CAN DO THIS AND- RIGHT THAT FINE WE ROLL IT WE ROLL IT OUT IN A WAY THAT'S IN CONCORDANCE WITH THE- TECHNICAL ROLLOUT. BED TO MIGHT ALLOW US TO STILL AT LEAST GET PARTS OF THE STATE- AND THEN EVENTUALLY BY THE END OF THIS WINDOW. HOPEFULLY THE ENTIRE STATE. ON ONE PLACE. WITHOUT HAVING TO DO MANUAL ENTRY AND SO FORTH. A LOT OF THINGS I THINK A LOT OF THINGS TO THINK ABOUT AS AS AS WE GO FORWARD AND I WILL- I WILL ASK OUR POLICY STAFF TO FOLLOW UP WITH THIS AS WELL. THANK YOU OKAY LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER TEN ELIMINATION OF PREMIUM COPAYS IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. SET A BUDGET REQUEST IF THE THREE POINT TWO MILLION- TOTAL FUNDS NINETEEN MILLION GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND EIGHTY NINE MILLION TOTAL FUNDS I'M GOING TO REDUCE PREMIUMS. ARE FAT PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS CHILDREN AND WORKING DISABLED PROGRAMS TO ZERO DOLLARS EFFECTIVE JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THIS PROPOSAL COVERS ALL MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES CURRENTLY PAYING PREMIUMS AND CO PAYMENTS. BUT THIS PREMIUM REQUIREMENT PLACES AN UNDUE BURDEN ON INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THAT ARE ALREADY LIVING ON LIMITED INCOMES ARE RESTRICTED IN THE PURSUIT OF SUBSTANTIAL- EMPLOYMENT DUE TO A DISABILITY. MONTHLY PREMIUM PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS CREATE BARRIERS IN ACCESS TO CARE AND CAN LEAD TO UNNECESSARY BREAKS IN COVERAGE FOR INDIVIDUALS. I'M SURE THIS POLICY AT INDIVIDUALS SHE WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO PAY ANY OUTSTANDING PREMIUM AMOUNTS I KNOW THAT'S A QUESTION THAT'S BEEN THAT'S COME UP. I'M JUST TO BE SPECIFIC ON THE POPULATIONS THIS INCLUDES IT'S OPTIONAL TARGETED LOW INCOME CHILDREN'S PROGRAM THE 210050% WORKING DISABLED PROGRAM. CHILDREN'S HEALTH INITIATIVE PROGRAMS MEDICAL ACCESS PROGRAM AND THE MEDICARE ACCESS INFANT PROGRAM. IN ADDITION- THE BUDGET ADVANCES A PROPOSAL TO REDUCE ALL CO PAYMENTS IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM TO ZERO DOLLARS HI THIS IS ALSO EFFECTIVE JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO. TO BRING THE PARKS DEPARTMENT INTO COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS ALL INDIVIDUALS ENROLLED IN MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE ARE SUBJECT TO NOMINAL COPAYMENTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF. FOSTER CHILDREN ARE PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS AND CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF NINETEEN YEARS OLD. EXISTING LAW REQUIRES MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WITH SOME EXCEPTIONS TO PAY A NOMINAL NON ENFORCEABLE COPAYMENTS FOR COVERED SERVICES. MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES MAY BE CHARGED BY PROVIDERS AND THAT PROVIDER RETAINS THE COPAYMENTS WHEN SERVICES ARE RENDERED AND COPAYMENTS ARE NOT PASSED ON TO IT TO THE DEPARTMENT. DHS IS SEEKING TO REDUCE COPAYMENTS AT THE MEDICAL PROGRAM TO ZERO DOLLARS IN AN EFFORT TO REMOVE. BARRIERS IN ACCESS TO CARE AND TO AVOID COSTLY SYSTEM CHANGES THAT WOULD OTHER NICE OTHERWISE NEED TO BE MADE TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS. CURRENTLY PROVIDERS MAY NOT TONIGHT HERE THE BENEFICIARIES I'M ABLE TO PAY COPAYMENTS AT THE TIME OF THE APPOINTMENT MEANING THERE IS LITTLE RATIONALE FOR MAINTAINING THIS NOMINAL NON ENFORCEABLE REQUIREMENTS FOR COPAYMENTS. THE STATE DOES NOT RECEIVE ANY REVENUE. BASED ON THE COLLECTION OF COPAYMENTS. BY REACHING TO ASSIST THAT AFFECT THE TRACKING OF COMMITMENTS RESULT IN A C. COST. THERE WE BOTH NOT ONLY IT BENEFITS TO THAT- BENEFICIARY BUT ALSO COST EFFECTIVE- TO REDUCE COPAYMENTS. ZERO TO ALLEVIATE THAT NEED FOR TRACKING SYSTEM. THAT I CAN GROW MARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ILIO. THE MINISTRATIONS FISCAL ESTIMATES REGARDING THE MEDICAL PREMIUM REDUCTION- DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR A CASELOAD INCREASE AS A RESULT OF THESE REDUCTIONS- WHEN WE DISCUSS THIS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN DAY ONE OF THE RUSSIAN THAT SUCH AN IMPACT ON THE SMALL AND DIFFICULT TO PREDICT HOWEVER BASED ON THE NUMBER OF STUDIES RETHINK REDUCING PREMIUMS WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN SOMETHING NOT INCREASE IN ENROLLMENT. DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN THE TRUCK AND THAT WAS IT- MENTIONED YOU KNOW AND THEN MINISTRATIONS TESTIMONY AS WELL AS REMOVING A DETERRENT EFFECT PREMIUMS HOP ON ENROLLMENT. WELL THERE IS CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY THAT COULD RESULT IN INCREASED GENERAL FUND COSTS POTENTIALLY IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE AGREE WITH THE POLICY BASIS FOR THE PROPOSAL OUR BEFORE APPROVAL WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ASKING MINISTRY ADMINISTRATION WHY THERE'S SOMETHING OPEN OKAY SO THE IMPACT IS REASONABLE AS WE THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT. INFORMATION TO DETERMINE ITS APPROACH SO% SHOULD BE APPROVED AS IS OR WITH MODIFICATIONS TO THE COST. ESTIMATES THANK YOU. NOT GOING TO CUT INTO UNITED. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M MICHELLE DEPARTMENT FINANCE. SO HOW. THANK YOU. THE DRUG ABOUT CAN YOU CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THE AND I WILL GO ON THE SINGLE VERY SUPPORTIVE THIS ISSUE IT'S A FROM THE NUMBER WE'RE DOING IT BUT CAN YOU ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF NOT PROTECTING ANY- INCREASING. IN CASELOAD. FOR THIS I WOULD TURN IT OVER TO YOU DO YOU ENJOY PEACE. OKAY EIGHT IN JULY AND- ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HEALTH CARE BENEFITS AND ELIGIBILITY- THE WANTING TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF THE FISCAL MODEL THAT WE HAVE USED TO PROJECT- CURRENTLY IT IS A VERY COMPLEX MODEL GIVEN THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY WAVING- THE PREMIUMS ARE FOR THESE VERY POPULATIONS- AND AGAIN WITH THE UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF THE INCREASED- BUT WITH THAT- CONTINUOUS ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS THE TWO NEXUS AT THIS TIME- IS KIND OF DIFFICULT- FOR US TO PROJECT WHETHER THERE WILL BE AFTER SCHOOL- DIFFERENCE OR INCREASED I'M IN KIND OF THE TOTAL CASE LOAD FOR THESE POPULATIONS WITH THE REDUCTION OF THE PREMIUMS TO ZERO AT THIS TIME- I THINK WE'D KNOWLEDGE THERE PROBABLY IS SOME ADDITIONAL MODELING WE CAN DO YOU- AS WE ARE. LOOKING FOR KIND OF THE END OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY IN TERMS OF ITS IMPACTS IT'S VERY DIFFICULT THIS TIME TO ISOLATE IT THIS CALL MODEL THAT WE HAVE IN THE. UNCERTAINTY WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. THANK YOU WE CHECK IN BACK ON A DOCTOR FRIENDLY THING ON THIS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET'S MOVE ON TO THAT AND LET ME ASK ON ISSUE. ELEVEN TWELVE THIRTEEN- DOES LMAO OR DEPARTMENT FINANCE HAVE ANY. ANYTHING TO SAY ON MOST. ON AN ISSUE FOR ISRAELI HONESTLY THIRTEEN WE JUST WANTED TO STATE THAT WE BELIEVE THERE A STRONG CULTURE RATIONAL FOR THE PROPOSAL- AND WE HAVE NO CONCERNS WITH THAT OKAY SO- TO DIRECT BUS WHY DON'T WE DO ELEVEN THROUGH FOURTEEN AND THEN WE'LL STOP AND GO BACK TO LA- IN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND THEN SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AFTER THAT. ACCORDING TO COUNTER RIGHT. THAT'S OUR MEDICAL THAT'S CORRECT SORRY WE'RE NOT DOING THAT MUCH. I WAS PUT IN THE OVEN FIFTEEN.

BOTH IN TERMS OF THE CURRENT- TEMPORARY CHANGES- AND YOU DRESS SOME OF THAT INITIAL OPERATIONAL CONCERNS- THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED ONCE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAVE TRANSITIONAL POLICY.

WE ARE CURRENTLY I'M ANTICIPATING WITHHOLDING ABOUT 64% AT THE JANUARY INVOICE OUT WE ARE STILL UNDERGOING A VALIDATION PROCESS TO ENSURE- AT THE SOME OF THE METRICS ARE MATCH- OR WERE NOT MATCH AND- I'M WITH BACK TO I WILL IT OVER ANY. OKAY THANK THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH- SINCE WE GROUPED A BUNCH OF- ITEMS TOGETHER RIGHT AND I'VE- DOUBLE DOUBLE CHECK ANY FURTHER. BECAUSE I THINK. LISA FIRST SAID WE WERE DOING FOURTEEN NOW WE ARE- SO. ANY COMMENTS FROM LA L. ON ANY OF THE ITEMS. THIS IS REALLY GOOD FOR THE L. A. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON IT AND FOR THE IT IS VERY UNFAIR AND EFFICIENCY THE NEXT ISSUE WILL HAVE COMMENTS FOR ITS ISSUE THIRTY ONE OR SAY YES OKAY ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT SO KEEP THAT IN MIND- FINANCE ANY ANY COMENTS ON THE- ITEMS THAT WE WERE JUST HEARD. ENTER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NO ITEMS. OR NO NO I'M- WAS HONORED IN SISTER YOU OKAY THANK YOU ALL RIGHT- I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS HERE SO WE'LL JUST GO TO SCHOOL RUN THROUGH THEM IN ORDER- AND THEN ISSUE ORDERS SO ISSUE ELEVEN- I APPRECIATE THAT. THAT'S A THAT'S ABOUT TO RE DETERMINATION OF FEDERAL GUIDELINES I GUESS THAT THE QUESTION I HAVE HERE AND THEN I REALIZED THAT- WE ARE DEALING WITH- FEDERAL GUIDELINES. WHICH WE DO HAVE TO FOLLOW. THE SO WE'RE CHANGING FROM THE NINETY DATES HERE WHICH MEANS THAT ACTUALLY EXCELLENT. BY UNDERSTANDING YOU TELL ME IF I GOT IT WRONG SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT- SOMEONE'S ON MEDICARE HOW THE I GUESS THEY BEEN. PAY ME SOMETHING IN THE MAIL WHATEVER ANYWAY THEY DON'T RENEW. AND THEN THEY SHOW UP FOR A VISIT AND THEN USED TO BE IF IT'S WITHIN NINETY DAYS WE BASICALLY GETS A LOOK YOU KNOW YOU'RE STILL ELIGIBLE SO WE SICKLY YOUNG GET YOUR STUFF AND THEN YOU'RE NOW BACK IN BUT THEN WE DON'T HAVE A BREAK IN BETWEEN. BECAUSE OF THAT THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THAT SERVICES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND THEN. NOW IN THIS CASE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THAT WE HAVE TO RE ENROLL THEM. SO DON'T BE DISCONTINUITY IT IS THAT WHAT THEY ARE AND TRYING TO STAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE- BECAUSE WOULDN'T THAT THEN MEAN THAT. THEY WOULD HAVE TO RE ENROLL SO BEFORE THEY WOULD BE. WELL WELL ACTUALLY WE COULD GO BACK AND SIMPLY SAY THEY'RE STILL ON A ROLL RIGHT- DEATH THE NINETY EIGHT YEAR BUT NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE SAYING THAT. ACTUALLY YOUR BRAND NEW PATIENT AGAIN BECAUSE YOU DROPPED OFF AND THEN WE HAVE TO RE ENROLL YOU AND WE HAVE A GAP RIGHT. IT WILL TURN IT OVER TO YOU INJURE OUR ELIGIBILITY EXPERTS THANK YOU THANK YOU MICHELLE HI SENATOR PENN I CAN CERTAINLY ANSWER NOT- SO IT'S A- YOU'RE CORRECT- IN SOME INSTANCES WHERE SOME INDIVIDUALS DO COME IN A PREVIOUSLY DURING THE NINETY DAY JUROR WE REINSTATE THEM BASICALLY- SO THERE'S NO- GAP IN THEIR COVERAGE HOWEVER WITH OUR LINE- WITH THE UPDATED FEDERAL GUIDELINES WHAT WE ARE DOING IS. THE INDIVIDUAL WILL COME IN AND IT WILL BE THE SAME A DOCUMENTATION AND WE ARE NOT REQUIRING THEM TO FILL OUT YOUR APPLICATION- BUT THEY WILL HAVE TO REQUEST A RETRO ACTIVE COVERAGE OF FOR THE MONTH IF THEY BECOME A MONTH THREE AND THERE ARE. NO FEAR WITHIN THE ORIGINAL NINETY DAY CURE PERIOD FOR MONTHS ONE YOU ARE VERY SIMILAR TO HOW WE TREAT YOUR APPLICATIONS- THE COUNTIES WILL AUTOMATICALLY WITHOUT REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM THE- INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS COMING BACK- BASICALLY REINSTATE COVERAGE BUT THEY WILL TREAT THEM LIKE ANY APPLICANT AND WHAT'S ACTUALLY GONNA HAPPEN IS THERE WILL BE- THE RENEWAL DATES FOR THE INDIVIDUAL ACTUALLY EXTENDED. PREVIOUSLY THEY ACTUALLY HAD A SHORTENED RENEWAL BECAUSE OF THE NINETY DAY CURE PERIOD WITH THE UPDATED INTERPRETATION FROM CMS- THAT WAS RELEASED ALL EIGHT TWENTY TWENTY- THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL IF THEY DO COME IN A LATER IN THE NINETY DAY CURE WHICH IS OUR RE APPLICATION ON THEIR RENEWAL DATE ACTUALLY WILL BE LONGER SO BASICALLY THERE- THEIR COVERAGE ACTUALLY WILL ALSO BE LONGER. AND HOW MUCH HOW MUCH LONGER IS THIS RENEWAL OF THE RENEWAL TIME NOW IT'S GONNA BE TWELVE MONTHS SO SAY IF THEY DO COME IN A MONTH THREE OF THE ORIGINAL NINETY DAY CARE- DURING ALL CURIOUS WILL ACTUALLY BEGIN IN MONTH THREE- BASICALLY MEANING THAT THEY'LL STILL HAVE TWELVE MONTHS FROM THIRTY. OKAY SO JUST TO CLARIFY BECAUSE LEE SAID THAT YOU KNOW THESE USES AN AREA- IS THAT RIGHT THERE ON THE GROUND ROLE MEDIC HOW- YEAH DON'T RENEW THEY'RE BUSY YOU CAN'T FIND THEM DATE COULD TO PAY ETCETERA RIGHT- SO IT'S ALMOST TIME A SIZE TO GET TO THEM. THE NATION UP FOR. THE NUMBER ROOM THE SHOW A CLINIC. OR SOME AND THEN WE'RE LIKE OH YOU'RE NOT IN MAY. SO DOES THAT MEAN THEY CAN'T GET SEEN OR THAT MEAN THE PROVIDER THEREFORE DOESN'T GET REIMBURSED- WHAT WHAT HAPPENS AT THAT POINT- BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE QUOTE. THE NEW PATIENT BUT THEY'RE NOT TECHNICALLY I MEAN SOMEONE WOULD HAVE TO ENROLL THEM- SO WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE THAT'S USUALLY WHAT I SENT IT OUT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS BUT CERTAINLY THAT'S A SCENARIO RIGHT. THE REASON THAT WE FIND OUT THEY'RE NO LONGER ENROLLED THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE SHOWING UP FOR CARE. AND DO WE SAY OH SORRY WE CAN'T SEE YOU TODAY BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT MEDIC COW BUT HERE'S YOUR PAY YOU KNOW GO GO GO TALK TO THE COUNTY OR WHATEVER ELSE AND THEN YOU CAN COME BACK LATER- AND- OF COURSE THE PROBABLY SHOWING UP FOR SOMETHING A CUTE BECAUSE THAT'S USUALLY YOU KNOW. WHAT WHY THEY SHOWED UP. ITS BUSINESS AFTER I GET THAT RIGHT OURS IS IT'S ALREADY GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET. THE CARE AND STOKE AND THEN THE PRIOR STILL GOING TO BE ABLE. TO GET REIMBURSED FOR THE CARE THEY PROVIDED. YES SO WE'RE NOT. MATER NECESSARILY. KIND OF ANY OF THAT- THE- THE PARAMETERS WITHIN THE NINETY DAYS AND I THINK. I AM THE OLD ROLES BEFORE THIS UPDATED GUIDANCE WITHIN THE NINETY DAY CARE AT. THE BENEFIT THREE DOES HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PROVIDING THE NECESSARY INFORMATION. AND WE'RE NOT CHANGING NOT- EVEN WITH THE ALIGNMENT OF THE FEET TO THE UPDATED FEDERAL GUIDANCE. IS REALLY MORE A TECHNICALITY IN TERMS OF CALLING IT A PURE REINSTATEMENT. WITHIN THE NINETY. EIGHT OR INTERNAL. EIGHT EXCITED WHICH IS A RE APPLICATION. BUT NOT HAVING THE INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNT TO PROVIDE LIKE A FULL OUTLOOK. OKAY SO NOW IT'S SO OKAY SELLS. PATIENT NOW YOU KNOW THEY DIDN'T RENEW THEIR DEATHS NOW THEY'RE SHOWING UP IN THE CLINIC AND THEY SAID YOU KNOW I'M HERE BECAUSE- YOU KNOW I INJURED MYSELF. OR FOR BREEZE AND HAVING YOU KNOW. OR SOMETHING- IS THAT. AND THEY'RE SHOWING UP IN A CLINIC THAT IS THAT AND WE FIND OUT WELL YOU'RE NOT ENROLLED IN MEDICAID HOW IT EXPIRED. ARE WE GONNA GET PAID OR DO WE SEND THEM OFF TO THE MERGES THE ROOM TO BE TELLING MY GO TO YOUR ELIGIBILITY WORKER- I MEAN I'VE BEEN WORKING OUTSIDE SO WE TAKE CARE OF THE PATIENT THAT IS THE CLINIC AND GET PAID FOR THAT. APPOINTMENT IS THE DIGGING A REIMBURSED BY MEDICARE OR NOT. THEY WILL THEY WILL BECAUSE THERE WILL BE A RETRO PERIOD IN WHICH THEY CAN'T REQUESTS WERE TRAUMATIC CAL AND DEPENDING ON THE PERSON'S CIRCUMSTANCE THE WILL BE- BASICALLY. BE PUT BACK INTO THEIR ORIGINAL STATE OF COVERAGE- FROM MONTH ONE TO WHERE THEY ARE NOW SO. THE RULES APPLY ENTRANCE RAMP HERSELF I SENT A MAINTENANCE OUTSIDE BUT DID NOTE THAT THE- THE CLINICS AND THE BILL. TO THEIR MEDICAL PLAN- THEN BE REIMBURSED. CORRECT OKAY BECAUSE I CAN BE ASSIGNED TO THE SAME PLAN. ZERO FOUR YES MOST LIKELY YEAH WELL. THE MOST LIKELY THEY COULD AFFORD TO GET SANCTIONS RIGHT BECAUSE NOW THEY GET PUT AND THEN THEY GOT- WELL WAIT A MINUTE WE DON'T TAKE THAT PLAN WEIRD THE OTHER PLAN RIGHT SO FORTH SO OKAY WELL. I APPRECIATE THE ANSWER IT'S OBVIOUS YOU KNOW WE'RE WITH IT THAT WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T CAUSE YOU KNOW DISRUPTIONS ARE PEOPLE NOT BE ABLE TO GET CARE- AND LEAVING- PATIENTS ARE THERE. ARE PEOPLE TAKING CARE OF THE PAIN OKAY- SO. THAT THE- STAFF ON ISSUE TWELVE AGAIN REPEATED I GUESS I WOULD JUST SORT OF MORE OF A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE IS THAT- YOU KNOW CCP WAS A VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM PARTICULARLY SINCE WHEN WE DIDN'T. PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR PEOPLE FOR CHILDREN OF UNDOCUMENTED- WHEN OUR MEDICAL RATES ARE MUCH LOWER AND- DID AND ACTUALLY HAD MORE POSITIONS WHEN HE TAKES EACH D. P. AND SO FORTH. AND THIS THIS IS A WAY TO HELP ACTUALLY IMPROVE ACCESS SO CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHY- NOW BUT I ALSO REMINDER THAT- WE NEED TO BE SURE. THAT THE OTHER THINGS WE PUT IN PLACE WE CONTINUE THIS POLICY CERTAINLY KNOWS DON'T SEE THE CHANGE HAPPENING ANYWHERE IN HORIZON BUT- JUST WANTING KNOWLEDGE THE HISTORICAL ROLE CCPS. PLAYED AS WE'RE PHASING IT OUT. ISSUE THIRTEEN SOUNDS- ISSUE FOR. MEDIC OR AND WITH THE DIRECTOR SAID I GUESS- YOU KNOW JUST. I DO HAVE TO SAY FOR THE RECORD HERE- THAT- YOU KNOW THE ROLLOUT JANUARY FIRST DID NOT GO WELL- YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUES AND- OUR DISTRICT OFFICES ARE HEARING ABOUT THAT- CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE- TRYING YOU KNOW TRYING TO DRESS MANY OF THESE THINGS- AS AS THE ROLLOUTS CONTINUING I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT IF. FOR SOME REASON- YOU KNOW THERE IS INSUFFICIENT STAFF ON PLACE- OTHER OTHER REASONS- THEN WE NEED TO SLOW DOWN. THE TRANSITION SO THAT WE DON'T LEAVE PATIENTS HANGING LIKE WE DID WHAT WE SAW AT THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY- SO THAT THAT MEANS THAT- AND I KNOW THAT'S- CERTAINLY NOT YOUR INTENTION BUT- THAT THE- CERTAINLY SHOULD BE DRIVING A TIMELINE THAT THEN LEADS TO THE PROBLEMS THAT WE SAW THAT HAPPEN ON THE INTERNET AGAIN ENGINE ENDED JANUARY FRANKLY. I GUESS THE QUESTION I DO HAVE TO GET YOU TO TALK ABOUT THE REST OF US YOU TALKED ABOUT THE DIGITAL STAFFING AND SO FORTH THAT MAGELLAN'S BRINGING ON BOARD- IS THAT- IT IS. SO I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE HAVE SERVICE CHALLENGES STAFFING BEFORE I MEAN IT IS THERE IS% THERE A CONTRACT- THAT THEY HAD WITH T. H. C. S. I MEAN I GUESS I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT THE- THE DAY CONTRACT FOR THE SUFFICIENT STAFFING- AND THAT- THERE. THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE I DON'T WANT THEM TO CONTINUE TO UNDERSTAFFED BECAUSE THEY SAID WELL TWO YEAR CONTRACTS FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF STAFFING AND- TURNS OUT WE NEEDED A LOT MORE THAN WE DID BEFORE SO- CAN YOU CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO THAT THAT THE TERMS OF THE CAPACITY OF. THE CONTRACTOR MAGELLAN TO BAD PEOPLE TO CARRY OUT THE CONTRACT IN A WAY THAT ENSURES SO I KNOW THEY'RE GETTING HIT WITH PENALTIES AND SO FORTH. BUT MOVING FORWARD DENTURES THAT- WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THIS TRANSITION AND- AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIND A CONTRACTOR WHO GOES OH WELL YOU KNOW AND WE'RE TRYING TO. WORK WITH THE COST OF THIS CONTRACT IS GONNA BE MORE THAN WHAT WE'RE GETTING FOR IT. I WOULD SAY THERE ARE PROVISIONS IN A CONTRACT SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THE METRICS THAT THEY MUST MEET AND YOU KNOW. THEY WOULD NEED TO ADJUST THEIR STOPPING TO MEET THOSE METRICS AND SOME OF THE STRATEGIES THAT THEY ARE USING- IS YOU KNOW HIRING RECRUITING HIRING NEW STAFF BRINGING- OTHER STAFF AND FROM OTHER- MAGELLAN- THAT PHARMACY PROJECTS AND THEN THEY ARE ALSO- CONTRACTING WITH THEM. A VENDOR A CALL CENTER VENDOR THAT CAN KIND OF CONTRACT CONTRACT AND EXPAND I'M JUST SUPPORT. THAT THEY NEED THAT AS AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE MONTHS AND YOU KNOW AS WE KNOW. I'VE BEEN WITH AT ONE HUNDRED NINETY DAY TRANSITION PERIOD ENDING IN JULY WE ARE I MEAN OUR EYES ON THE BALL AND HOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE ARE PLANNING FOR THAT AND THE ABILITY TO STOCK UP AS NEEDED QUICKLY. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR BENEFICIARIES CURRENTLY. BENEFICIARY IS THE EXPERIENCE- AND GETTING THAT MEDICATIONS ARE BENEFICIARIES AS OURS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. OKAY WELL IS IT IS IT A GUESS I'D SAY IS THAT IF FOR SOME REASON YOU CAN'T GET ALL THE PIECES TOGETHER IN TIME CLEANING THE STAFF AND WE- YOU KNOW JUST REALIZED IT'S THE IT'S HARD TO HIRE A- CIVIL PROTECTION A LITTLE LATER TOO. SO YOU CAN HAVE IT YOU CAN HAVE JOBS OPEN THAT. ADVERTISE WE MAY NOT ACTUALLY SOLD THEM ALL OR DID IT HARDEN TIME FOR TRAINING SO FORTH. I HOPE THAT WE WILL. AS MUCH AS WE'D LIKE TO STICK TO THAT. STILL THE TIME WHEN YOU HAVE. THAT. THE TIMELINE SHOULDN'T. OVERRIDE IT YOU KNOW IT'S THE TASK SEASON. THEN WE SLOW THE DOWN THAT WE DON'T LEAVE PATIENTS HANGING- WE JUST DON'T A REPEAT OF WHAT. AND JENNY AND- I THINK THERE MAY STILL BE SOME PEOPLE WERE STILL DEALING WITH. OKAY AND THEN- I GUESS. PLEASE READ THE UPDATE ON THE FIFTH- ON THE PHARMACY RECRUITMENT AND I THINK THAT CONCLUDES MY QUESTIONS AT LEAST FOR ITEMS THROUGH. ISSUE FIFTEEN THANK YOU.

HELLO OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINE- START WE THE LA- FOR ON ISSUES THROUGH TWENTY PLEASE. ANYTHING TO ADD. THANK YOU SENATOR ADNAN KOREA SHEET WITH THE ALLEY- WE DON'T HAVE ANY COMMENTS TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES AND THE NEXT TIME WE WILL RAISE COME IT WILL BE FOR ISSUE THIRTY ONE AT LEAST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- DEPARTMENT FINANCE. INTRODUCTION DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE JUST RESPONDING TO. THAT ONE QUESTION ON THE ON THE pMY SINGLE YOUR FUNDING IS PROPOSED RATHER THAN ONGOING. WE JUST TALKED ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY IS MUSCLE. CONCEAL CONSIDERABLE RISK REMAINS- AND BUILDING STRONG REVENUES IS CRITICAL. OR FROM RESERVES IS CRITICAL IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT ONE TIME RESERVE REVENUES BE USED FOR ONE TIME EXPENDITURES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN. FISCAL STABILITY HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT THIS FUNDING IS AVAILABLE UNTIL JUNE THIRTIETH. OF TWENTY TWENTY FIVE OR- I'M- IMMIGRATION ITEMS OKAY AND I THINK JUST FOR THE RECORD THE- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING A WHOLE NEW DEPARTMENT OF EQUITY. AND SO THIS IS A I THINK IT'S A GREAT ISSUE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY- OUR NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES THAT HAVE OFTENTIMES EXPERIENCE THE LACK OF THAT. AND SO I'M VERY HAPPY THAT WE'RE FUNDING. FOR THEIR THEIR ISSUES AGAIN AND WOULD WOULD LIKE US TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT IF POSSIBLE BUT APPARENTLY THING ON THESE ISSUES ISSUE SIXTEEN CONSIDER THIS PRACTICE ON ISSUE SEVENTEEN EXTENSION DENTAL MANAGED CARE APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT AN EVER RECALL CORRECTLY AND DEDRICK HOW AIMED AND THE REPORT SHERMAN WERE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW ACTUALLY THE REPORTER RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MEDICAL DENTAL AND LONG TERM CARE TOGETHER. SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE X. YEAH SO I GUESS THIS PROPOSAL FOR A ONE YEAR EXTENSION FOR THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE. AND I KNOW THAT- YOU TALKED ABOUT DIFFERENT PROVISIONS FOR ENSURING THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE TO MAIL MEET UTILIZATION OTHER THINGS COMPARISON T. FOR SERVICE SO FAR. IS THE ATTENTION TO BECAUSE IT. WOULD EVENTUALLY GOING TO THEN PUT EVERYONE BACK TO ILLUSTRATE. AT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE TO PUT PEOPLE INTO MANAGED CARE IN THE FUTURE PLUS WITH THE RETIREMENTS AT RATE OF ACTUALLY SELL BECAUSE THOSE WERE PUTTING TOGETHER DECKS. THE MEDICAL BILLS THE HEALTH PLAN WITH THE DENTALS AND- AND THEN THE LONG TERM CARE. SO IS IT IS IT IS THE INTENTION THEN TO- TO BASICALLY- CONTINUED EXISTING MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THAT THE DENTAL PLANS UNTIL AND EVENTUALLY THAT GETS FOLDED IN AS AS EVER THAT'S NOT ONLY OF COURSE THERE'S TWO COUNTIES BUT EVERY OTHER COUNTY GETS A- IT IS ROLLED INTO SOME SORT OF A- DENTAL MANAGED CARE AS PART OF THE LARGER. RETIREMENT YES JUST TO CLEAR THAT MY COMMENTS EARLIER WERE JUST SPECIFIC TO THE DENTAL MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT EXIST IN SACRAMENTO AND LOS ANGELES OKAY YOU ARE CORRECT IN THE ORIGINAL CALLIN PROPOSAL THERE WAS CONTEMPLATION ON A- VERY FUTURE. A CONCEPT AROUND A CARBON DENTAL INTO YOU TO MEASURE AS YOU KNOW THERE'S A CEMETERY- A PILOT- THAT JUST WENT LIVE WITH THAT ALL RIGHT NOW. HOWEVER THAT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT R. F. P. THAT IS OUT FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT WOULD GO LIVE IN JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. WE ARE PRESUMING THAT WILL BE A FIVE YEAR. CONTRACT WITH THOSE THAT DO THE PROCUREMENT SO THE SOONEST THAT WE WOULD ENGAGE IN THAT IS QUITE FAR FROM NOW IT WOULD BE NOT INTEL I YOU KNOW AT LEAST TWENTY TWENTY NINE OR LATER. BUT THIS TIME I WE ARE NOT CONSIDERING THAT AS A PART OF THAT THE PLAN HERE WE STILL NEED TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE FROM CMS IS A PERSPECTIVE OF THE CURRENT DENTAL MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS- AND SO. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE ARE FOCUSED ON BECAUSE PROCUREMENT IF THAT'S HELPFUL OKAY SO THERE IS THE ADDED SO THERE WILL BE A REQUIREMENT FOR. A RE PROCUREMENT AND DISTURBING YOU MEET ALL STANDARDS AND JANET FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. YES THAT IS CORRECT FOR BOTH SACRAMENTO AND LOS ANGELES.

WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON THE REALIGNMENT QUESTIONS THIS TIME BUT HAPPY TO. BE IN TOUCH. WE'LL TAKE A QUESTION BACK. OKAY WELCOME OKAY WELL I MEAN I GUESS I GUESS MAYBE I ASK ELLIE ELSE AND SO IT WORKS FOR US- SO IT'S WRITTEN OUT I MEAN IT'S- AND IT'S CERTAINLY DEALT WITH REALIGNMENT HEARING THIS COMMITTEE FIRM FOR MANY YEARS AND- SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT. WE HAVE SALES TAX VEHICLE LICENSE FEE RATE AND- I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE CORRELATION IS BETWEEN SALES AND VEHICLE LICENSE FEE AND NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO. AND IT ALSO WITHOUT GOING INTO A BILL WE ACTUALLY HAD A HEARING SEVERAL YEARS AGO WE TALKED ABOUT THE REALIGNMENT HELD THE MONEY SORT OF ACTUALLY FLOWS THROUGH AND YOU KNOW SORT OF LIKE A WATERFALL RIGHT AND THEN THIS PERSON TKES AS ITS CENTRAL. ANDS AND SOMEWHERE TOWARD THE BOTTOM ACTUALLY IS INTERESTING UP BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND PUBLIC HEALTH- SO WE WE'VE SEEN. WE'VE SEEN THEM WHERE THINGS FARTHER UP THE WATERFALL ESSENTIALLY HAVE DRIED UP INCREASES TO FOR THOSE. SO IT IS THAT THERE'S REALLY NO IT'S DONE. SOME ANALYSIS AND SO THE THOUGHTS OF. WE'D WE'D SO WE HAVE THICK KALLONI AT THE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH PEACE OF THE COUNTY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AND THEN WE HAVE PROP SIXTY THREE. NOT THAT IT'S BEEN A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT PROP SIXTY THREEBUT- IS THERE BEEN ANY ANALYSIS LOOKING AT- ALL TE REVENUE FOR- EVEN A HEALTH. CHANGES GIVEN. I GUESS THE TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENTS WHICH IS NOW I GUESS ELEVEN YEARS OLD EVEN JUST POPULATION SO IS IT THE WHAT'S THE CORRELATION THERE AND IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH ACTUALLY END UP ENDS UP. ALSO TRICKLING DOWN OR GOING DOWN THE WATERFALL INTO INTO MENTAL HEALTH IS THAT WE- AS AS IT WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. DR VAN KOREA SHEET WITH THE L. A. L. WE DON'T HAVE A YOU KNOW PREPARED RECOMMENDATION ON SORT OF WHAT SPECIFIC CHANGES TO REALIGNMENT SHOULD- OCCUR GIVEN SORT OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU YOU WILL. DESCRIBE WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT OUR OFFICE. HAS TAKEN A LOOK AT REALIGNMENT BROADLY IN A REPORT WE CAME OUT WITH- I THINK IT WAS ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO. NOW WHERE WE SORT OF EXAMINE THIS ISSUE YOU SPEAK OF. THE FACT THAT REALIGNMENT REVENUES AND VEHICLE LICENSE FEES AND SALES TAX DON'T NECESSARILY TRACK. WITH ANY SORT OF METRIC OF MENTAL HEALTH THE MAN WE MADE WE MADE WE RAISE SOME SORT OF HIGH LEVEL. COMMENTS IN THAT REPORT RELATED TO- ISSUE AND SIR JUST SORT OF A RACE THAT HAS AN ISSUE FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION BUT WE DON'T HAVE WE DIDN'T HAVE SORT OF PREPARED RECOMMENDATIONS IN THAT IN THAT RECORD AT THAT TIME- WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT OUR OFFICE. NOW IS WORKING ON A- SORT OF A PROJECT LOOKING AT TWENTY ELEVEN REALIGNMENT BROADLY AND SORT OF WE DON'T HAVE AN A AN ANTICIPATED TIME. FRAME FOR WHEN THAT SORT OF REPORT WOULD BE RELEASED BY ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS SORT OF THIS SIMILAR- ISSUE THAT YOU RAISE AS FAR AS LIKE THE REVENUE STREAMS NOT SORT OF TRACKING WITH DEMAND FOR MENTAL HEALTH THE OTHER THE OTHER POINT THAT I WOULD. RAISE IS THAT THERE'VE BEEN A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT VERY SIGNIFICANT LIKE POLICY CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN WHICH HAVE SORT OF IMPACTED- SORT OF- WHICH MAY HAVE SORT OF IMPACTED COUNTY. AT LOCAL DEMAND FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SO THERE'S YOU KNOW THERE WAS A BIG EXPANSION. UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THERE HAVE BEEN. CHANGES TO YOU KNOW THE STRUCTURE THROUGH WHICH- SUBSTANCE USE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED THROUGH THE NEW THE RELATIVELY NEW ODS SYSTEM AND SO- ONE OF THE ISSUES ARE GOING TO BE TAKING A LOOK AT IT JUST SORT OF THERE. THE. THAT SORT OF THESE REVENUES THEY DON'T JUST THEY DON'T JUST NOT TRACK SORT OF MENTAL HEALTH TO ME AND THEY DON'T THEY ALSO DON'T TRACK SORT OF SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGES THAT MAY OCCUR- AFTER SORT OF THE REALIGNMENT DATE AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A SUPER HELPFUL ANSWER FOR YOU I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK INTO IT YEAH AND I THINK THAT AND I THINK THAT'S THE POINT THAT WE'RE THAT WE'RE WONDERING WHY SHOULD WHY SHOULD WE REALLY BE LOOKING AT THIS AND SO WE'RE GLAD THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THAT AND LOOKING AT IT AS WELL BECAUSE IT SHOULD BE TRACKED SOME KINDA. IT TO SOMETHING. HAD GET IN. THE SALES TAX VEHICLE. LICENSE FEE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE. EXACTLY THAT- BUT ANYWAY I AM GLAD YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT. AND I THINK WE'LL HAVE A LOT MORE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS GOING FORWARD. NO NO AND- TODAY I DO THINK THAT ALICE IS GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT. RIGHT AND IN FACT- CHEROKEE MEN- IT MEANS. THAT I KNOW YOUR LEADERSHIP IN MENTAL HEALTH- BUT MAY BE BOLD TO. SUGGEST THAT WE WORK WITH THE L. A. O. AND CONSIDER AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING JUST. YOU KNOW WHAT. WE DON'T EVEN NEED RECOMMENDATIONS LET'S JUST LOOK AT WHAT THE SITUATION IS RIGHT. BECAUSE WE HAVE. BOTH THE REALIGNMENT MONEY FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH WE HAVE PROP SIXTY THREE. AND I UNDERSTAND. THAT YOU'RE A MAN YOU'RE TAKING A LEADERSHIP ROLE LOOKING AT PROP SIXTY THREE. HOW THEY COME TOGETHER- AND OF COURSE THEY HAVE THEIR OWN REQUIREMENTS AND AS YOU SAID WE'VE MADE OTHER STRUCTURAL CHANGES. AND THE- THIS IS A FORMER CHAIR OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ALSO YOU KNOW. OPENING UP REALIGNMENT OF BIG TIME. IS A VERY DAUNTING TASK SO IT'S A- IT'S A- SO I. WON'T QUITE SUGGEST THAT YET. ALTHOUGH I THINK I HAVE IT IN THE PAST SAYING THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD. KIND OF. THINK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT BUT- BEFORE ANYONE GETS TOO FREAKED OUT HEARING ME SAY THAT. RIGHT NOW- BUT AT LEAST LET'S. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. AT WHAT. KIND OF RESOURCES. DO WE HAVE IN MENTAL HEALTH. AND HOW. IT EXACTLY. SO IT'S NOT IT'S A BUILT IN THE PAST AND THEN WE HAVE PROGRAM CHANGES AND THEN GOING TO THE FUTURE BECAUSE OF ITS KIND OF FLAT. REVENUE SOURCE WELL. WELL WITH THE DEMAND IS GOING UP- WE'RE GONNA FIGURE HOW TO CLOSE. GAP RATE AND OF COURSE PROP SIXTY THREE WE HAVE DEAL WITH OF ALL. RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT MAIN REVENUE COMING SO IT'S PROBABLY DOING PRETTY WELL RIGHT NOW- BECAUSE ACTUALLY THE- THERE'S SOME PEOPLE DOING VERY WELL OR VERY RICH. I THINK THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE DOUBLE THEIR INCOME WHILE MANY OF US. FOR NOT. IMPOSSIBLE TO RICH AND NOT DONE SO WELL. WITH THE PANDEMIC- BUT THAT HELPS OUR TAX REVENUES SO. WE NEED TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE VOLATILITY WE NEED TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE- WHAT IS NOW WE'RE GONNA GET THE COUNTY'S RESPONSIBILITY AND- FOR MENTAL HEALTH- WHAT RESOURCES. AT THE REALLY GOTTEN IS THAT OUR DATE. AND WE CALLED THE ALIGNMENT BUT YOU KNOW HOW HOW THE LINES ARE NOT ALIGNED SO EVEN JUST SIMPLY. THEY GRAPH THAT SHOWS OKAY. HERE'S POPULATION HERE IS THE REVENUE. RIGHT HERE POINTS IN TIME PROGRAM CHANGES AT CETERA. AND HAVING AN EXPLANATION OF THAT AND FRANKLY I THINK IT WOULDN'T HURT TO HAVE A- OTHER INFORMATIONAL HEARING WHAT YOU'VE DONE HERE BEFORE A BRIEF ONE. TO JUST TALK ABOUT WHAT REALIGNMENT ITSELF MEANS THAT OBVIOUSLY AFFECTS MENTAL HEALTH BUT ALSO AFFECTS LOCAL FUNDING FOR IBM FOR HSS EFFECTS- LOCAL FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHER THINGS TO HER IN THE REALIGNMENT. BUT BUT AT LEAST ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH. I THINK WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE TRAJECTORY IS RIGHT IS THAT IS THAT FUNDING PROJECT REVIEWS FAR AS WE CAN PROJECT IS THAT GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT OR IS IT GOING TO BE BECAUSE OF FALLING SHORT AND- AND SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT KIND OF POLICIES WE NEED TO. MAKE AND ALSO WHAT KIND OF CONVERSATIONS WE DID HAVE BECAUSE I WAS A REALIGNMENT IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE STATE AND COUNTY STRAIGHT. AND SO THERE'S- AND RELATION TO THOSE REVENUE SO AS I GUESS- THIS I WOULD PASS IT THE BEST OF THE CHAIR ASK L. A. L. TO DO THOSE TYPE ANALYSIS PERHAPS IN PREPARATION FOR. A MORE IN DEPTH EXAMINATION OF THIS ISSUE- MANY PEOPLE SUGGEST STATS AND A HOPE AND A PLAN ASK ELLIE- DO YOU THINK THAT'S. SOMETHING YOU CAN HELP WITH YOU CAN YOU CAN DO FOR US. I CERTAINLY THINK IT'S A- YOU WOULD WORK WITH SORT OF THE COMMITTEE TO SEE WHAT WE CAN PROVIDE. I YOU KNOW I DID MENTION THAT THAT- THAT SORT OF PROJECT THAT WE'RE WORKING ON THAT SORT OF SKIN IN THE WORKS AT THE TIME AND SAID MAYBE THERE CAN BE SOME INFORMATION THAT WE COME UP WITH. THROUGH THAT PROCESS THAT WE CAN SHARE BUT- WE'LL WE'LL TAKE THAT BACK AND WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN SORT OF PROVIDE TO THAT TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR XI YEAH AND I AND I WAS NOT ON THE COMMITTEE WHEN WE HAD THAT HEARING AND- AND I KEEP WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT REALIGNMENT AND SO I WOULD LIKE MORE INFORMATION AND TO ALLOW STAFF TO MAYBE YOU KNOW WHAT WE'LL BE DOING IT THIS YEAR. THE HEARING HOPEFULLY WE WILL BUT WE WON'T BE TACKLING ANYTHING AROUND REALIGNMENT THIS YEAR- BUT SO WE COULD MAYBE. SEE IF ABOUT GETTING THAT SCHEDULED LATER ON AND TO REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT I MEAN I DON'T. I DON'T THINK IT'S OUTRAGEOUS TO SAY. THAT OUR COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM HAS BEEN AN ABJECT FAILURE I MEAN I DON'T THINK YOU CAN READ ANYTHING. ANYTHING ABOUT THE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH IN OUR IN OUR COUNTRY FROM THE SEVENTIES FORWARD THAT SAYS THAT WE HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB WE HAVE STRUGGLED AT THIS. WE ARE FORTUNATE RIGHT NOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES. AND I'M AND WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T FAIL BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO GOOD WORK IN TRYING THEIR VERY BEST. WE FEEL BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WAS STARVED AND WASN'T SET UP- TO ACTUALLY DO COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH-THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY AFTER DE INSTITUTIONALIZATION. SO GOING FORWARD AS WE HAVE A BUNCH OF NEW RESOURCES AND NEW PROGRAMS- I THINK IT IT MAKES SENSE TO REALLY. THEN LOOK AT THAT MAP KIND OF BASE FUNDING. GOING FORWARD WITH REALIGNMENT MONIES. SO ALL THE STAFF BEGIN TO WORK ON. LOOKING AT THAT. OKAY LET'S NOW DO- TWENTY SIX THROUGH TH. WHAT WE DO. TWENTY SIX TO THIRTY. ONE ABOUT THEIR- ALL RIGHT WE'LL WE'LL START THAT.

WAIVER AS SERVICE MEDICARE ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS AGES TWENTY ONE AND OLDER AND BRIDGES THE GAP BETWEEN INDEPENDENT LIVING AND NURSING HOME CARE. OF THE L. W. OFFERS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NURSING FACILITY PLACEMENTS AND PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INDIVIDUALS TO TRANSITION OUT OF NURSING FACILITIES.

HELLO THANK YOU FOR THAT LMAO OUR OFFICE RECENTLY PUBLISHED A PUBLICATION ON EACH CBS SPENDING AND WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS IMPLEMENTATION WE WANT TO DISCUSS POTENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OUTCOMES OF THE H. CVS SPENDING PLAN. THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE HAS PREVIOUSLY REQUESTED THE MINISTRATION KEEP THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY UP TO DATE ON PROPOSE PROGRAMMATIC AND FUNDING. CHANGES TO THE INSIDIOUS SPENDING PLAN. NOT NOT A REPORTER THE GOVERNMENT RECORD REPORT. IN ADDITION TO THESE REQUESTED UPDATES ALLEGED COULD CONSIDER WAYS TO USE THE BUDGET PROCESS FOR THE STRENGTH IN LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT- TO POTENTIAL WYS WOULD BE TO ADOPT LEGISLATION THAT ESTABLISHES A PROVIDES MORE DETAIL ON INTENDED PROGRAM STRUCTURE OF LONGER TERM-EACH CVS ANNOUNCEMENTS. AND THEN ALTERNATIVELY WRITTEN ON A DOCKING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS REGARDING THE OUTCOMES OF THE HDS AND SPENDING PLAN. WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CERTAIN ECS ENHANCEMENT IN ORDER TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER ANY STATE FUNDING TO CONTINUE THE MISSION. AFTER THE ENHANCED. FEDERAL FUNDING IS EXPIRED. ALL IN. TERMS UP HERE PROCESS IS ISSUE. THIRTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ON. ON THE ISSUE. IF YOU WERE TWENTY EIGHT- I KNOW THIS IS BEEN AN AN ONGOING ISSUE WITH- TIMELY ACCESS FOR FOLLOW UP I GUESS MY QUESTION IS AROUND IS THAT IS IT MOSTLY JUST A WORK FORCE ISSUE AND AN UP- NOT ENOUGH CONTRACTED PEOPLE IN A NETWORK THAT THE REFERRAL SAID DON'T TAKE PLACE AS QUICKLY- I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY A NUMBER OF FACTORS I THINK THAT. WE HAVEN'T FORMALLY I MEASURED THIS ACROSS ALL THE RESPECTED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AREAS-THROUGH THIS INITIATIVE AND BUILD WE WILL BE ABLE TO BETTER ANALYZE AND LOOK AND SEE WHAT WE ARE SEEING ACROSS VARIOUS COUNTIES BOTH ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE ON AND THE MANAGED CARE SIDE. AND THEN BE ABLE TO ACCESS- YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS OR OPPORTUNITIES. TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY HOW WE CAN ENSURE PEOPLE ARE GETTING- APPROPRIATE YOU KNOW TIMELY ACCESS TO THOSE FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS I THINK THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THAT MEASURING THAT REPORTING ON IT AND THEN LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT. OKAY THANK YOU ON ISSUE NUMBER. TWENTY NINE- THE PROBLEM KEEPS GETTING WORSE SHOULD OUR **** OUR FUNDING CONTINUED TO GROW BUT IT LOOKS LIKE- YOU'RE ASKING FOR LESS MONEY IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR AM HOW DO WE HOW DO WE KNOW THAT WE'LL REACH SOME KIND OF- LEVEL. BY THEN. BECAUSE OF OUR LEASE I WILL DEFER TO YOU ON THE SPOT. SURE YEAH SO- YOU'RE DEFINITELY CORRECT THAT THE RATES OF OVERDOSES HAVE BEEN INCREASING I'M NOT ONLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT BASICALLY ACROSS THE WEST COAST AND THAT'S REALLY BEEN ON TO THE FACT THAT. THE INCREASE OF THAT NOW THAT'S BEEN COMING OUT HERE ON THE WEST COAST AND NOT JUST FUNCTIONAL- THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE USING BATHROOM PHANTOM KILLS- SO A LOT OF COUNTERFEIT- YOU KNOW NOT IT USED TO BE THE OPIOIDS CAME OUT ON THE STREET FOR PRESCRIPTIONS BUT NOW THEY'RE JUST BEING MANUFACTURED. ON AND SO IT'S REALLY JUST EXASPERATING ON THE OVERDOSE CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE THEM THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS BEEN PUTTING A LOT OF EFFORTS TOWARDS THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC AND WE HAVE SEEN A LOT OF SUCCESSES. BUT ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW FENNEL HAS REALLY BEEN IMPACTING YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA AND THE SYSTEMS AT LARGE I'M SO I KNOW I DIDN'T FULLY ANSWER A QUESTION ABOUT THE FUNDINGWE HAVE. OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS RECEIVED FEDERAL DOLLARS TO ASSIST WITH THIS- AND OF COURSE WE HAVE FUNDING THAT WE'VE RECEIVED THROUGH OUR WAIVERS TO HELP TREAT- INDIVIDUALS WITH A SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER ON THIS FINDING IS JUST GOING TO EXPAND SOME OF THE WORK WE'VE DONE IN CALIFORNIA. I'M MOST NOTABLY YOU KNOW PROVIDING THE LIFESAVING. REVERSAL MEDICATION NALOXONE. WHICH IS REALLY IMPAIRED AND ONE OF THAT KEY PIECES OF YOU KNOW INSURING WHEN SOMEONE'S IN OVER TO HAVE A AVAILABLE. AND IN THIS MANY HANDS POSSIBLE. THIRTY EIGHT PERPLEXING PERPLEXING ISSUE AND- HE WAS SAYING TO ME WELL IT'S THEY'RE GETTING A PRESCRIPTION I KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE MANUFACTURING IT NOW AND DO ARE YOU WORKING WELL THE MAN IS NOT YOUR DEPARTMENT BUT BEING REALLY ABLE TO GET TO THE CRUX OF THAT THAT. THAT IS VERY DANGEROUS I'M NOT HERE STOP IT'S COMING IN ANYWAYS IT'S VERY DISTRESSING- TO THE ILLEGALS LA ROSA IS. POSITION ABOUT. NEEDING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE OVERSIGHT ON ON EACH OF THESE ALL OF THESE ARE ARE MOSTLY- SEP NOT SUPPLEMENTING BUT AT AT ADDITIVE TO WHAT WERE ALREADY DOING IT IS THAT CORRECT OR OR IS ANY OF THEM MAYBE WITH THE NINETY JUST AS THE WAIVER. THAT IS DIFFERENT BUT EVERYTHING ELSE WE'RE ALREADY PAYING FOR AND THE FEDERAL MONEY IS IN ADDITION IS THAT CORRECT- SO IT'S A VARIETY OF PIECES SO FOR CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT- THIS IS A NEW INITIATIVE- THAT WE- PROPOSE THAT THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST TIME IN DRYING DOWN- FEDERAL FUNDS. UP FOR THAT- PROGRESSIVE PROGRAM- FOR THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND THIS IS YOU KNOW VERY COMPLIMENTARY TO THE CONVERSATION WERE HAVING EARLIER. IN REGARDS TO ENSURING THAT WE ARE BUILDING THOSE LOCAL CONNECTIONS. TO GET DOLLARS BUT AGAIN A NEW. INITIATIVE HERE ALL OF THOSE PIECES- SAME THING WITH THE CONTINUING PILOTS AT CAL BRIDGE WAS AN EXISTING PROGRAMS OR ADDING DOLLARS- THERE I'M NOT I JUST THIS IS A ONE TIME PAYMENT. TO HELP SUPPORT WORK FORCE- AND THEN YES THE ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER- IT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND THIS IS JUST AUGMENTING IN ADDING SLOT SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF VARIETY- ARE THESE ITEMS AND- HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. AND THEN FOR EACH OF THEM DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE METRICS IN PLACE IT WILL BE ABLE TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND- ANALYZE WHETHER THE STATE WOULD THEN CONTINUE. PROVIDING THAT LEVEL OF FUNDING AFTER THE FEDERAL MONEY GOES AWAY. SURE SO FOR CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT OUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE WAIVER- ARE WITH CMS ON THE WAIVER WE DID IT. IT TOOK ALL OF THAT YOU PATIENT INDEPENDENT EVALUATION OF THAT PROGRAM TO DEMONSTRATE ITS EFFECTIVENESS- AND IN IN AND OUT COMES THERE- FOR THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS INCENTIVE PROGRAM IT'S ALSO A VERY. A MEASURE BASED INITIATIVE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO REPORT OUT OF WHICH MEASURES WERE MET IN METRICS WERE MET FIRE ANAGED CARE PLANS IN THEIR- LOCAL. COUNTY AT PARTNERS IN REGARDS TO THAT PROGRAM. A NUMBER AND I WILL BE SEPARATE FROM THE WORK THAT THEY'RE ALREADY DOING OR DISTRACTED THAT IS. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE DESIGNED AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM WITH DEDICATED FUNDS FOR THE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS HOW PIECES JUST KNOWING THAT THE REALLY LARGE LIFT LOTS OF NEW PARTNERSHIPS. I NEED TO MAKE SURE IT'S SIX LAST FOUR IN AND MEASURING. GETTING CAN TO THE SERVER. GETTING THEM. KEEPING THEM- THE GOAL OF THOSE THOSE. AND ON THAT IS CORRECT THAT IS NEW BOB THERE WILL BE CLEAR MEASURES THAT THEY WILL BE REPORTING TO US. MR HOUSER CALIBRATION THE OTHER SO I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES ALL OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE VERY CLEAR WHAT WILL HAPPEN MEASURES AND METRICS WE CAN REPORT CMS IS GONNA EXPECT THAT AS WELL GIVEN THE DOLLARS THAT THEY- HAVE PUT ON THE TABLE- AND SO OUT WE WILL BE ABLE TO REPORT THAT OUT. AS NEEDED. THANK YOU. FOR THANK YOU- SORRY GO BACK ISSUE TWENTY NINE- AND INTEREST- TRIGGERMAN THE ANSWER SO THE FUNDING GOES FROM A HUNDRED AND ONE- MILLION DOWN THE SIXTY ONE MILLION THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR- SO THAT THE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FORTY MILLION DROPPED- FROM ONE YEAR TO THE OTHER. ITEMS IN THE APOLOGIZE AND TRY TO PARSE OUT EXACTLY WHAT GETS WHAT ARE YOU FINDING THAT ONE FOR ONLY A YEAR AND THEN AND THEN ELIMINATING- SO I UNDERSTAND THAT- WE'RE INCREASING THAT SERVICES THE LICENSE FACILITY THAT'S THAT'S GONNA BE ON GOING TWENTY THREE AND A HALF IN A TWENTY ONE POINT EIGHT ON GOING. THE NEW MATTE AXIS. THAT WAS JUST A ONE YEAR THING TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THE I MEAN DON'T WE DO HAVE TO MAINTAIN THOSE ACCESS POINTS OR- TO START- AND THEN IT CERTAINLY I MEAN IN AN ACT OF THE KNOX OWNED DISTRIBUTION PROJECT IS THAT THE ONE ONE YEAR EFFORT AND THEN WE STOPPED OR- SO JUST LIKE CLARIFY WHAT'S- WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE FUNDING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. DOLLARS NOT FUNDING AT TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A WEEK CUT THE FUNDING REQUEST. FIVE CENTS A FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. GREAT I'LL TAKE THAT AND I APOLOGIZE THAT I WASN'T CLEAR EARLIER. I'M SO ALL OF THESE PROJECTS STARTED WITH FEDERAL DOLLARS SO THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT THERE'S A STATE INVESTMENT ARM AND THE- CALIFORNIA MATRIX PENSION PROJECT- I'M GONNA LOCK SOME PROJECT IS. GOING TO BE ONGOING FUNDING- WE HAVE ACTUALLY WITH THAT PROJECT ALREADY HAD OVER FIFTY THOUSAND. RECORDED OVERDOSE REVERSALS JUST FROM THAT PROJECT ALONE- AND THAT'S JUST IMPERATIVE RIGHT NOW THAT THE THOUGHTS ON GOING FUNDING BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY- AS- I STATED THIS IS AN EASY TO SOLVE- SOME OF THE OTHER PROJECTS HOW AND HOW MUCH IS THE- ACTUAL DISTRIBUTION PROJECT. SORRY HOW MUCH WAS THAT. HOW MUCH OF IT SO. IT'S A LITTLE OVER. THIRTY MILLION OKAY. I'LL JUST HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER RIGHT IN FRONT AS GOOD ENOUGH FOR YEAH REALLY SENT THEM NOW. TO YOUR QUESTION ABOUT. THAT M. A. T. ACCESS POINTS SO WE'VE ALREADY INCREASED ABOUT SIX HUNDRED ACCESS POINTS. IN VARIOUS KIND OF NONTRADITIONAL SETTINGS AND A LOT OF THAT WORK IS MORE HELPINGS AND- YOU KNOW STUFF ABOUT. HAVING A PRESCRIBER ONSITE GETTING INITIAL START UP- THERE'S SOME FUNDING AND GIVEN FOR. UNDER INSURED OR UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS ABOUT MOST OF IT IS REALLY JUST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OF BREAKING THROUGH WHATEVER YOU KNOW BARRIERS FROM THERE OF. WHY THE NBA TEAM HASN'T BEEN PRESCRIBING. ON VENDORS BY THERE SO THAT IS KIND OF YOU KNOW- BASICALLY MORE AROUND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND NOT SAME WITH THE JAIL PROJECT BECAUSE BOX ONE TIME FUNDING AS WELL- WE ALREADY HAVE BEEN WORKING. WITH MANY JAILS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHING MHD. HADN'T IN THE PAST AND SO WE JUST WANT TO CONTINUE THAT AND THAT SUPPORT FOR THE INITIAL COUNTIES- AND THEN GET OTHER COUNTIES ON BOARD. THE JUST THE CLARIFY FOR THE- NEW MATT ACCESS POINT SO WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IS THAT YOU JUST NEED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND THEN ONCE YOU LAUNCH THEM THEY RUN ON THEIR OWN- SO THAT WE DON'T NEED TO FUND THE MANY MORE. OR EXIT TENDER STAND HOW THAT WORKS AND- YOU CAN ALSO INTO YOUR ANSWER. TALK ABOUT THE ONES THAT WERE VERY FINE DETAIL OF COURSE FEE FUNDED WITH FEDERAL FUNDS AND OTHERS OTHER MAXIS. POINTS I THINK WAS SIX HUNDRED OR SOMETHING- ACCESS POINT- SIX HUNDRED. YOU FOR- SO HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE KIND- SO HAVE. TO HUNDRED SO. HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE STILL ONGOING OR DO THEY START FADING AWAY AFTER WE KICK THEM OFF AND THEN TELL SOME OF THEM CLOSE ITS ADDRESS SO CAN YOU JUST TALK ABOUT. THE RE JUST LAUNCHING THEM AND THEN THEY RUN ON THEIR OWN OR DO IS WHAT WHAT HAPPENS WHAT HAPPENS IS THESE ACCESS POINTS. WE DO THIS NO PROBLEM YES THEY'RE ALL A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT- BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT SETTINGS. AND THAT WE'VE BEEN EXPANDING. THEM AND SOME OF THEM. HAVE BEEN IN OUR LICENSING OUR LICENSING SYSTEM- SO PERHAPS THEY'VE BEEN PROVIDING. MEDICAL SERVICES BUT THEY HAVEN'T PROVIDED MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT SO THE ONGOING FUNDING SOURCE. AS THE MEDIC HOW THEY JUST HAVEN'T. YOU KNOW DONE THAT AND THEY'RE SETTING TYPE OKAY- OTHERS ARE CONNECTED MAYBE TO. THE BROADER ETHICAL HEALTH MEDICAL SYSTEM WHICH ALSO PROVIDES A MEDICATION ASSISTED TREATMENT MAYBE IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL. PHYSICIAN THAT JUST NEVER CAUGHT THEIR ACT WAIVER AND NOW IT'S STARTING TO PRESCRIBE BUPRENORPHINE. AND WE ALSO HAD SOME SPECIAL PROJECTS% FOR OUR TRIBAL MEMBERS. AND SO ONCE AGAIN THEY HAVE FEDERAL DOLLARS AS WELL SO THEY'RE ALL A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. IN THE SENSE OF. WHAT THAT THE FUNDING SOURCE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT. USING THIS MONEY FOR SERVICES THAT'S REALLY MORE JUST TO HELP THEM SET UP. ON THE PROGRAM AND THEN THEY HAVE THAT THE FUNNY TO ME. OKAY SO THE- PROJECT THAT SO I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW IS THAT. OF THE SIX HUNDRED FIFTY NOW PLUS ANOTHER HUNDRED WERE BUDGETING FOR. HOW MANY OF THEM AFTER WE SORT OF LAUNCH THEM OFF AND HE SAID WE COULD. STAY CONTINUE YOUR ROOM SO WE'RE TEACHING THEM HOW TO DO THIS NOW THERE BUT NOW THEY LEARN HOW TO DO IT THEY CAN GET MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENTS WHATEVER ELSE. HOW MANY OF THEM CONTINUE TO DO IT AS NOW THAT WE TRAIN THEM THEY SAY HEY I WANT TO DO THIS YOU TRAIN THEM. I'M NOW AN ACCESS POINT. AND THEN. THEY STILL CONTINUE TO BE AN ACCESS POINT I MEAN THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT REASONS SOMEONE MAY STOP FOR EIGHT NINE. FOR SOME REASON NO PATIENTS ARE COMING EVERY FEW PATIENTS ARE COMING ARE DEFINED AT THE- YOU HAVE TO BE TRAINED AT IT'S- JUST BECOME VERY ONEROUS OR THEY'RE JUST TOO BUSY DOING EVERYTHING ELSE AND SO FORTH I. THINK IT'S JUST HELPFUL TO KNOW- HOW ME THEM STILL IN THE- RIGHT ARE STILL ACT. DOING IT RIGHT SO WE- WHAT WE- I'M STILL CERTAINLY IT'S THE END. OF THE C. HUNDRED. PLUS NOW UP TO DO WE HAVE THREE HUNDRED UP DO YOU STILL HAVE ALL THE- SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY UP. I THINK I'D BE HELPFUL TO KNOW BECAUSE ALSO. IDENTIFYING WHAT THE REASON PEOPLE DROP OFF IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT RIGHT- AND THEN IF WE KNOW WHY AND IF IT TURNS AND IT'S WE KNOW WHY PEOPLE ARE DROPPING OUT WE MAY NEED ME MAY ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT WE MAY NEED TO DO. TO EITHER KEEP THEM STANDING UP OR EVEN MAYBE PERHAPS IDENTIFY WHO ARE THE BETTER ACCESS WANTS ME TURNED OUT LIKE WE TRAINS ON THEIR EAGER TURNS OUT TO NOT REALLY GET ACCESS POINT AND THAT'S WHY THEY ENDED UP DROPPING OUT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW PEOPLE JUST WHEN ACCESSING THAT ACCESS POINT RATE SO. ENDED THAT MAY HELP WITH INFORM US IN TERMS OF FOR FUTURE ACCESS POINTS- WHICH WHICH WHAT CHARACTERISTICS WOULD MAKE THEM MORE SUCCESSFUL YOU KNOW ONE BECAUSE IN THE END THE SUCCESS OF THE ACCESS POINTS ALSO HOW MANY PEOPLE THEN TURNED TO THAT SITE TO ACCESS. RIGHT SO WE TRAINS ON THE PROVIDE ACCESS NOW THE QUESTION IS THAT OUR PEOPLE PARTAKING OF IT IS THAT IS THAT FACILITY NOW WELCOMING OUR DAY SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY YOU KNOW THAT COULD PROVIDE THAT SERVICES EFFICIENTLY IN OTHER WAYS SO THAT PEOPLE CONTINUE TO COME TO THAT SITE SO WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE CAPACITIES OF THE COMMUNITY. THE SENSE. DEFINITELY AND WE CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH- SOME OF THAT OKAY THE CURRENT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THAT WE HAVE STOOD UP BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF DATA AROUND NOT SUBJECT TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT OF COURSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY OF THE HUNDREDS YET BUT WILL BE- BUT- YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S HELPFUL BECAUSE THEN WE WANNA BE SURE THAT WE CONTINUE MEETING THAT CAPACITY BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY LOOKS LIKE THE OPIOID CRISIS ISN'T GOING AWAY AND DECIDED NOW AND NOW IT'S NOT PRESCRIPTIONS IT'S- PEOPLE MANUFACTURING IMPORTING SO WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE SURE WE STILL HAVE THAT. WE HAVE THE CAPACITY AND IN THE COMMUNITY AND UNFORTUNATELY THE NUMBERS ARE STILL GOING UP SO. MMHM WE NEED TO PUT. MORE FOCUS ALL RIGHT I APPRECIATE THAT- SO THE FORTY SOUNDS LIKE THE FORTY MILLIONS MAINLY THE- THE ACCESS POINTS AND THE JAILS AND DRUG COURTS AT LEAST WE'RE JUST RUNNING FOR. THE NEW ONES FOR ANOTHER YEAR HOPEFULLY THEY CONTINUE GOING ON CORRECT. FOR MOST CORRECT OKAY AND THEN- SEE. I GUESS ON THE ISSUE- IN REGARDS TO ITEM NUMBER SORRY THIRTY ONE- FIRST OF ALL I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THEY WERE PUTTING FUNDING CONTINGENCY MANAGEMENT I NEED TO RECOGNIZE MY GOOD FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE- SIR WINNER WHO'S BEEN A BIG CHAMPION FOR THAT IT IS AN EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH SO APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE DOING THAT- IN TERMS OF- AND I KNOW THIS IS WHAT BEGAN WHEN THESE THINGS WERE WERE. ALSO BAILEY APPRECIATE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING SOME. FUNDING TO OUR- TO- VERY SIMILAR HSS ECONOMY PAYMENTS AS WELL- THEY DIDN'T WORKING VERY HARD AS WELL AND THAT- EDITOR'S INCENTIVE PLAN PAYMENTS- CTG DEALERS AND ASK- ALL RIGHT WELL IT SO I GUESS THE- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THE- WELL I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE HELPFUL IS- AND AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION IS GETTING SOME MORE DETAIL ABOUT EXACTLY HOW WE'RE GOING TO CARRY SOME OF THESE GOOD IDEAS OUT AND- HOW YOU GONNA BE COORDINATED WITH OTHER OTHER THINGS SO. THERE'S ROOM HOPEFULLY AND I UNDERSTAND FROM ILIO- IS THERE SOME DETAIL OF THAT THAT WE STILL NEED MORE DETAILS ON SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS RIGHT. SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. ON WE ARE ON A MORE DETAILS ARE NEEDED AT THIS TIME AROUND IN THE IMPLEMENTATION AND GET IT RIGHT YEAH I MEAN IF LIMITATION RIGHT SO WE GOT THE APPRECIATE THE IDEAS AND WE LIKED THE IDEAS BUT THAT'S IT THE- THE RUBBER MEETS ROAD SCHOLAR TALLY NOW WE'RE GETTING INTO THE IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND SO I THINK WE LIKE OUR BUT WE WANT TO IMPLEMENTATION SO OKAY SO- HOPING WE CAN GET SOME MORE INFORMATION ON THAT- AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU. OKAY SO LET'S- LET'S TWO THIRTY TWO AND TAKE US HOME. RIGHT SOUNDS GREAT I WILL KICK US OFF OUR. GET ORGANIZED HERE ARE- SO FOR ISSUE THIRTY TWO ON THE HOMOGENEITY BASED ALTERNATIVES WAIVER PROVIDES- HOME COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES SUCH AS AND HOW ARE IN HOME NURSING PERSONAL CARE SERVICES AND RESPITE SERVICES TO ELIGIBLE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES I WOULD NURSING LEVEL AT A LEVEL OF CARE THE STATE AS TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION TO CMS EVERY FIVE YEARS TO RENEW- THESE WAIVERS.

AND FOR THE LAST ITEM ISSUE AT THIRTY EIGHT- IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SENATE BILL ONE FORTY SEVEN AUTHORIZED A PILOT PROGRAM FOR COUNTY AND COMMUNITY BASED ACTIVITIES. UNDER THE PROPOSED PILOT PURCHASE SPEEDING APPS WHICH SEES WHAT MOVE AWAY FROM OTHER TRADITIONAL VALUE BASED PPS PAYMENTS ARE- SYSTEM. TO ONE THAT BETTER ALIGNS WITH THE BOBBING FINANCING AND DELIVERY HEALTH SERVICES. AS PROPOSED UNDER THE FCC APM PILOT- THE PPS PAYMENT A WRAP AROUND WOULD BE REPLACED BY AN UPFRONT CLINIC SPECIFIC APPLICATION RIGHT- THE BENEFIT TO THE PARTICIPATING ACCURACY IS THAT THEY WILL HAVE A SIMPLIFIED PAYMENT PROCESS. REPLACING THE PREVIOUS BILLING APPROACH- AND ASSOCIATED DELAYS IN PAYMENT. OF HUGE SEAS BUT RECEIVED A COMPREHENSIVE PAYMENT FROM THE HEALTH PLANS ON A MONTHLY BASIS RATHER THAN HAVING. TO WAIT UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR. FIRST UP WELL PAYMENT WHICH IS PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL FOR CASH STRAPPED HEALTH CENTERS. ARE THE PAYMENT REFORM WOULD ALSO ALLOW FQHCS THE ABILITY TO OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY. AND DELIVER- AT KAREN INNOVATIVE WAYS THAT WILL EXPAND BEYOND PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CARE ACCESS. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU EXCEED WHAT PROVIDE NONTRADITIONAL SERVICES ARE NOT CURRENTLY REIMBURSABLE UNDER THE TRADITIONAL VALUE BASED PPS- INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO GROUP VISITS EMAIL VISIT PHONE VISIT OUR- MANAGEMENT. CARE COORDINATION. AND A NUMBER OF OTHER US AT TOUCHES. ADDITIONALLY THE REFORM REMOVES INCENTIVES TO INCREASE VOLUME OF SEPARATE BUSINESS- THIS PROPOSED PILOT WAS ALSO EXPECTED TO INCREASE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS AND PARTICIPATING FQHCS. BUT BOTH WOULD HAVE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS BOTH BUT ALSO EXPERIENCE INCREASED VALUE FOR BETTER COORDINATION OF CARE THEREBY HELPING TO REDUCE UNNECESSARY UTILIZATION OF SERVICES. AND IMPROVE THE BENEFITS YOUR EXPERIENCE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY HEALTH OUTCOMES- HOWEVER DH CS. I WHAT UNABLE TO AND- THE PILOT OUT DO TO AN- TO RECEIVE FEDERAL.

MODIFIES LANGUAGE WHICH TRIGGERS RECONCILIATION TO BE ACTUAL UTILIZATION COMPARED TO PROJECTED UTILIZATION- AND ADDS LANGUAGE TO ESTABLISH QUALITY AND ACCESS STANDARDS AND IF THE PARTICIPATING AFTER. DOES NOT MEET ESTABLISHED STANDARDS THEY WILL BE REQUIRED TO RETURN A PORTION OF THE PMPML REVENUE WHILE ENSURING REVENUE RECEIVED WILL NOT BE LOWER THAN THE AMOUNT THEY WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN. RECEIVED UNDER THE TRADITIONAL PPS REIMBURSEMENT. IDEAS YES BEGAN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THAT- AFFECTED STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP THE PROPOSAL IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. LEVERAGING LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE PRIOR EFFORTS AND DISCUSSIONS TO ESTABLISH. THE- FTC EIGHT PM. OF COURSE. OUR TARGET GAUGE INCLUDE ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS LOCAL HEALTH PLANS OF CALIFORNIA AND REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FTC'S AND LOCAL AND COMMERCIAL MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS. I DH CS CONTINUES BY WEEKLY- MEETINGS WITH A CORE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY TO DESIGN AND OPERATIONALIZE THE EIGHT PM. I.

A SMALL WORK GROUP MEETINGS AND LARGE SCALE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AS WELL AS A TARGETED SUPPORT GROUPS WHEN NEEDED. TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND THIS CONCLUDES. THE DEPARTMENT'S PRESENTATION. I BET YOU YOU'D NEVER SAY THAT- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. OBAMA HELLO. THANK YOU SENATOR ADMIN COREY SEAGER WITH DAILY- WE JUST HAVE- SOME COMMENTS RAISED ON ISSUES THIRTY SIX AND THIRTY SEVEN- REGARDING THAT LIMITATION OF EIGHTEEN NINETY SEVEN PROVIDER RATE REDUCTIONS WE JUST KNOW THAT WE FIND IT UNCLEAR WHY CERTAIN MEDICAL PROVIDERS ARE PRIORITIZED OVER OTHERS FOR RESTORED RATES IN THIS PROPOSAL- THE LEGISLATURE MAY ALSO WISH TO CONSIDER THE MERITS AND COSTS OF RESTORING PAYMENT RETURN PAYMENT RATES FOR OTHER EVEN ALL- OTHER MEDICAL PROVIDER TYPES THAT REMAIN SUBJECT TO GET EIGHTY NINETY SEVEN RATE REDUCTIONS- WE ESTIMATE THE ANNUAL COST OF ELIMINATING ALL THE EIGHTY NINETY SEVEN GREAT REDUCTIONS- AT ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION MAY HAVE USE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE COLD AT NINETEEN PANDEMIC TO. INFORM THE SELECTION OF PROVIDERS FOR RESTORED RAIDS- THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO CONSIDER REQUESTING THE ADMIN TO- PROVIDE ITS RATIONALE FOR WHY THESE PROVIDER TYPES WERE CHOSEN AS WELL AS INFORMATION- SUCH AS ON THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS THE COPING NINETEEN ON THE SELECTED MEDI CAL PROVIDERS. RELATIVE TO OTHER PROVIDERS TO SUPPORT THIS RATIONALE- IN ADDITION YOU KNOW WHILE MANAGED CARE PLANS MAY NOT ALWAYS EXACTLY TIED THE RATES THEY PAY THEIR PROVIDERS TO RAISE THE MEDICARE FEE FOR SERVICE- WE FIND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL TO RESTORE RATES WOULD LIKELY AFFECT PAYMENT RATES AND MANAGED CARE AS WELL AS FEES FOR SERVICE- HOWEVER THIS PROPOSAL'S COST ESTIMATE ONLY INCLUDES THE COST IMPACT ON THE FEE FOR SERVICE SYSTEM. WHICH WE FIND MAY UNDERSTATE THE ULTIMATE COST- THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOTED THAT IT BELIEVES THAT THAT MANAGED CARE COSTS FOR THIS PROPOSAL WOULD BE SMALL BUT THE LEGISLATURE. OF ME WISHES OR REQUEST. INFORMATION JUSTIFYING THIS ASSUMPTION- REGARDING THE EQUITY IN PRACTICE TRANSFORMATION PAYMENTS PROPOSAL FIRST WE WOULD NOTE THAT. THIS PROPOSAL APPROPRIATELY TARGETS KEY AREAS OF CONCERN. RELATED TO QUALITY INEQUITY IN MEDIC COW WITH ITS FOCUS ON CHILDREN'S PREVENTATIVE SERVICES AND MATERNAL HEALTH- THE SPECIFIED GOALS SUCH AS IMPROVING CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATION RATES ALSO SEEM TO ALIGN WITH THESE AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT- HOWEVER A MORE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW WOULD BE NEEDED TO SEE IF THIS PROPOSAL- LEAVES ANY SPECIFIC QUALITY AND EQUITY DEFICIENCIES ARE ADDRESSED- SECOND ON THIS. PROPOSAL WE JUST KNOW THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A SENSE OF THE CURRENT STATE OF CLINICAL INFRASTRUCTURE IN THESE AREAS OF QUALITY AND EQUITY. I'M TOO TIRED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THIS IS A KEY FIRST STEP IN MEETING THE GOALS OF THIS PROPOSAL- NEXT WE WOULD NOTE THAT A LONGER ONGOING STRATEGY INCLUDING THROUGH PROVIDING INCENTIVES FOR. IMPROVING QUALITY AND EQUITY IN MEDIC COW WILL BE NECESSARY TO CREATING SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENT IN THIS AREA- MEAL LATE LAST YEAR DH CS RELEASED A DRAFT REPORT OUTLINING A STRATEGY IN THIS REGARD WHICH MAY PROVE. BENEFICIAL GOING FORWARD. FINALLY YOU KNOW WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE GATHER MORE INFORMATION ON THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE APPROVING- SOME KEY OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS RESOLVED INCLUDE NO WAY KEY QUALITY AND EQUITY GOALS ARE LEFT UNADDRESSED AND SHOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO THE PROPOSAL- WHAT IS THE CURRENT CONDITION OF MEDICARE ALL PROVIDERS CLINICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND WEISS CLINICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. AND APPROPRIATE FIRST STEP TO TAKE IN ADDRESSING THESE THESE EQUITY IN QUALITY GAPS- HOW WOULD GRANT APPLICATIONS BE SELECTED AND HOW WILL DH CS OVERSEE THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS- AND HOW WILL DH CS AS OTHER EFFORTS TO IMPROVE MEDICAL PERFORMANCE ON QUALITY AND EQUITY MEASURES. CONTRIBUTE TO ONGOING IMPROVEMENTS IN THESE AREAS- THOSE ARE THOSE ARE ALL OF OUR COMMENTS. AT THIS TIME HAPPY TO BE OF FURTHER ASSISTANCE WHERE NEEDED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE TODAY MR- THE- TRICK COOPER ON THIRTY SO. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY WHY SOME RAGE AND NOT AND NOT ALL OF THEM AND DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU MIGHT BE UNDER- PROJECTING- SO YOU KNOW WHEN THEY'RE PUTTING TOGETHER THE PROPOSAL DID IT INTENTIONALLY REALLY FOCUSING ON LEARNED THAT WE'VE HAD DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY SPECIFICALLY- WHICH REALLY ALLOWED US TO ZERO IN ON THE LIST THAT WE RECOMMENDED WE ALSO WE'RE LOOKINGAT THE OVER SECTION- AND CROSS OVER WITH OUR CONFERENCE OF QUALITY STRATEGY WHICH WE JUST RELEASED. A RECENTLY- IT WANTED TO ENSURE THAT ODD YOU KNOW THAT IS HOW WE NARROWED OUR LIST I WOULD JUST NOTE THERE ARE THERE ARE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF THINGS STILL LEFT ON THE EIGHTY NINETY SEVEN REDUCTION LIST- AND SO I WOULD JUST NOTATE THAT- SO WE DID TRY TO DO AN INTERSECTION THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THINGS LIKE NURSING SERVICES WHICH HAS BEEN YOU KNOW GREATLY IMPACTED DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY INCH IT WAS A CRITICAL WORKFORCE. PRIOR TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND JUST NOTATING IT SO CRITICAL ESPECIALLY EVEN IN RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- OBVIOUSLY THE OXYGEN RESPIRATORY SERVICES ARE ARE CLEAR- IN ALIGNMENT WITH SOME OF OUR CONVERSATIONS EARLIER TODAY AUDIOLOGISTS. AND HEARING AID- ITEMS ADDED TO OUR LIST TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING WHAT WE CAN TO HELP IMPROVE THE AREAS OF REIMBURSEMENT- THERE- AND SO YOU KNOW WE REALLY TRY TO LOOK AT IT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE IN REGARDS TO UNDERFUNDING YOU DO NOT FEEL THAT WAY BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE FOR SERVICE WE HAVE DONE AN ASSESSMENT ON THE MANAGED CARE RATES- AND OFTENTIMES MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE PAYING HIGHER THAN OUR FEE FOR SERVICE RATES CURRENTLY EACH. OF WHICH IS WHY WE DID NOT SCORE IT- AND SO AT THIS POINT WE FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE WITH OUR OUR OUR BUDGET PROPOSAL- AND I WOULD NOTE. IS NOW ON HERE THAT I. VISITED HIM. PROSTHETIC CLINIC AND THEY HAD A LOT TO SAY ABOUT. NOT HAVING THEIR RATES. IMPROVED FOR A REALLY LONG TIME AND AS WE KNOW. OUR ISSUES WITH- DIABETES AND LOSS OF LIMBS THAT WAY. I JUST THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY IMPACTS PEOPLE'S QUALITY OF LIFE. HIS ABILITY TO GET IT A GOOD FITTING. ARTIFICIAL LAMB- ON THE ISSUE ON THIRTY EIGHT. SO WITH THIS NEW TRANSFORMATION WHAT WITH THE PILOT. WILL BE ABLE TO SEE- PATIENTS ABLE TO SEE MORE THAN ONE- PROVIDER ON THE SAME DAY I'M ASKING ABOUT THE SAME DAY BILLING ISSUE REALLY. SHORT SO- THE PILOT HASN'T GONE LIVE YET BUT- THE EIGHT PM MODEL WOULD ALLOW AN FQHC TWO SEATS ON THE BENEFICIARIES AS MANY TIMES AS NEEDED IN THE DAY. GIVEN THE PAYMENT IS MORE LIKE A PM PM SO LIKE I ALMOST THINK ABOUT ALMOST LIKE HOW YOU PAY A PLAN A CAPITATION PAYMENT IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT COURSES- BUT AT TEN PM THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE MONTHLY- FOR THEIR SERVICES AND SO THAT GIVES THE FTC SIGNIFICANT. FLEXIBILITY AND IS THAT. HE WITH YOU. IS PMP. DOES IS DOES THAT READ CHANGE PER THE ACUITY OF THE OF THE PATIENT. IT DOES NOT BUT I'M GONNA TAG LINDSAY HARRINGTON R. OB DEPUTY OF FINANCING TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF HOW THAT PM PM WOULD WORK. FIRST WHAT WE WOULD DO IS WE WOULD BE DEVELOPING A PER MEMBER PER MONTH BASED ON AND THE CATEGORY OF EIGHTY FOUR. FOR THE PARTICULAR BENEFICIARY. AND LOOK AT ME EXPECTED UTILIZATION HISTORICAL UTILIZATION. THERE ARE HISTORICAL KEEP YES FREE. TO ESTABLISH HER MEMBER PER MONTH. PER MONTH BY CLINICS. FOR THEIR VARIOUS AGE CATEGORIES SO IT WOULD IN SOME WAYS ACCOUNT FOR THAT SCENE I'M NOT EXPECTING. A CUTIE DIFFERENCES SO FOR EXAMPLE A SENIOR AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES IT IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A HIGHER AVERAGE UTILIZATION. AND A CHILD. OKAY DECIDED WE'D WANT TO INCENTIVIZE NOT TO COMP. THE US. IT WOULD BE LOOKING AT THAT EXPECTED UTILIZATION FOR THAT CATEGORY- THAT THEY HAVE HAD HISTORICALLY YOU I DO HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS THE FIRST ONE ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY TWO DID WE GET APPROVAL FOR THE WAIVER. THEY'RE STILL ACTIVELY WORKING ON APPROVAL WITH THE US YOU MUST BE HAVING EXTENSION CURRENTLY THROUGH- MARCH AT THIS TIME ALL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM OKAY SO THERE'S AN EXTENSION SO THEREFORE WE ARE ABLE. TO BECAUSE SOMEONE OKAY SO IN OTHER WORDS BECAUSE IT SAID THAT WHILE THE WAIVER APPLICATIONS STARTING JERRY FIRST WHICH OF COURSE WAS YOU KNOW BOTTOM HALF AGO OR MORE- BUT WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN A WAIVER SO WE'RE NOT. WE'RE NOT IMPLEMENTING OF THIS YET RIGHT. ONCE WE FINISH OUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH CMS WHAT TYPICALLY HAPPENS IS THAT DOES GO RETROSPECTIVE- WE WOULD BE READY AND ABLE TO IMPLEMENT AS SOON AS IT IS A PRETTY LONG TIME. BUT I DON'T I ASSUME THERE'S FINE A LOT OF PEOPLE. I MEAN ARE PEOPLE ACTUALLY STARTING TO IT IN HOPES THAT BECAUSE OF THE WAIVER FOR SOME REASON ARE PEOPLE GOING TO WAIT. I THINK MOST PEOPLE ONLY FOR THE WAIVER TO BE APPROVED RIGHT OR IS. IT LIKE. IT WOULD TYPICALLY WAIT FOR THE WAIVER TO BE APPROVED OKAY THAT'S- ALL RIGHT SO JUST REALISTICALLY IT'S NOT STARTED YET BUT YOU SAID. HOPEFULLY BY MARCH IS THAT THE GOAL. I REALIZE THAT YOU CAN'T UNSEE MESSED DOWN. ALL RIGHT YES THAT WE ARE WORKING THROUGH THE- EXPECTS TENSION NOW- AND HOPING TO GET APPROVAL ON THE NEW ITEMS WITHIN THE WAIVER OF COURSE- PEOPLE ARE STILL ALREADY ACCESSING THE WAIVER SERVICES TODAY SO IT'S JUST THE NEW ITEMS RIGHT THE NEW ITEMS RIGHT CORRECT OKAY I JUST WASN'T CLEAR ON THAT SO JENNIFER SO I THOUGHT SO. NEARLY WAS ALL RIGHT- LET'S SEE THIRTY THREE AGAIN APPRECIATE- PUTTING IMPLEMENTING- THIS SO LOOKING FORWARD. TO GETTING A SERVICES FROM MEDIC HELL. AND WE'RE NOT TALK FIRST- FOR THAT HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT I THINK WE FINALLY DO- THAT'S THE ISSUE NUMBER- LET'S SEE SO ACTUALLY WE RECOVERED NUMBER THIRTY SIX OKAY- ISSUE NUMBER THIRTY SEVEN. SO I WOULD MAKE NOTES AGAIN APPRECIATE THESE EFFORTS FOR EQUALITY AND EQUITY HOWEVER AT LEAST OUR ANALYSIS AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG- THAT- WE'RE GONNA CLOSE MATERNAL CARE DISPARITIES FOR BLACK AMERICAN INDIAN. ALASKAN NATIVE NATIVE HAWAIIAN AND OTHER PACIFIC ISLANDER INDIVIDUALS. IS THERE A REASON WHY ASIANS ARE OUT AND I GUESS LATINOS ARE OUT. I'M SORRY TO HAVE TO PULL OUR DISPARITY REPORT BUT ACTUALLY LET YOU KNOW IS OFTEN RANKED IN THE HIGHEST QUALITY SCORES FOR ALL OF OUR POPULATIONS IN MCALLEN OFTEN I'M SO DO YOU- ASIAN POPULATIONS IT DOES VERY BASED ON THE MEASURE METRICS AND WE HAVE ALL OF OUR HEALTHCARE DISPARITY REPORTS POSTED ON DHS'S WEBSITE. BUT I WOULD SAY IS- WHILE WE ARE FOCUSED ON A CLOSING VARIOUS QUALITY EQUITY GAPS WE ALSO WE'RE LOOKING AT- YOU KNOW CLOSING CARE GAPS GENERALLY ON UTILIZATION AS WELL AND THAT WILL BE ACROSS ALL POPULATIONS- AND WE WILL BE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING QUALITY ACROSS THE BOARD REGARDLESS OF. VARIOUS PIECES- BUT WE ARE SEEING THE LARGEST DISPARITIES CURRENTLY IN OUR PROGRAM WITHIN THOSE POPULATIONS ARE CERTAINLY DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT BUT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT FIRST OF ALL I GUESS FOR THE ASIAN POPULATION I DON'T KNOW IF YOU DISAGGREGATED SO YOU CAN'T LUMP EVERYONE TOGETHER- THERE'S A LOT OF. VARIATION WITHIN- BUT ALSO POINT OUT AT LEAST FOR THE API POPULACE OF THE ASIAN POPULATION THAT THERE'S NUMEROUS STUDIES THAT SHOW AND IN FACT I'M JUST LOOKING HERE ONE AND. FROM JAMMEH THOSE PUBLISHED IN TWENTY TWENTY. IT'S A SAYING THAT RISK OF ADVERSE OUTCOME THIS AGAIN FROM MATERNAL MORBIDITY. AND ASIAN WOMEN IS HIGHER FOR ALL ASIANS EXCEPT JAPANESE WOMEN COMPARED TO WHITES I MEAN DID THERE'S CLEARLY DISPARITIES- THAT ARE HAPPENING. IN TERMS OF. MATERNAL OUTCOMES- AND IN THE ASIAN POPULATION- SO- SO I. DISREGARDED I CAN ON THAT YEAH. OUR FOCUS AND THE LIST OF. LOOKING TO CLOSE ALL GAPS OF CARE ACROSS ALL POPULATIONS- INCLUDING ALL SUBSETS AND ASIAN POPULATIONS INSIDE. YEAH THE PIECES SHOULD NOT BE ASKING IN THAT WAY WE'LL BE ABLE TO CLOSE- ALL CARE GAPS ACROSS ANYONE WHO HAS THOSE PARAGRAPHS ACROSS YOU KNOW PREVENTATIVE SERVICES- BOTH FOR CHILDREN ADULTS- THE MATERNITY AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WITH THE PROPOSAL. ALL RIGHT NOW I APPRECIATE THAT- BUT I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN SEEING WHAT KIND OF DATA DCS IS LOOKING AT PARTICULARLY WITH THIS AGGREGATED DATA CONCERNING THE ASIAN POPULATION. HAS HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU OKAY JOHNSON WAS VERY DISAGGREGATED IT. OKAY THE END THEY'LL PREVIEW YOU'RE TRYING YOU KNOW TRYING TO ADDRESS THESE QUALITY ISSUES. BUT- TO.
