MINUTE SO I GOT A LITTLE OVERZEALOUS WELCOME EVERYONE. MAHOOD STOOD THE JOINT INFORMATION HEARINGS IT'S SENATE COMMITTEE ON GOVERNANCE AND FINANCE IN THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES ON BUDGET AND REVENUE AND TAXATION THANK YOU. A CHAIR TING FOR BEING HERE AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER OBERNOLTE. WITHOUT WHEN I LET A ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING OPEN. THANK YOU IT'S A VERY EXCITING TO BE HERE AT ONE OF THE HEARINGS ARE REGARDING THIS SITE BALLOT MEASURE. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CHAIR FOR HOLDING THIS HOME WHILE I BELIEVE THE BALLOT MEASURE IS VERY LAUDABLE IN TERMS OF WHAT IT WOULD LIKE TO DO. I DO HAVE. FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT FEARS THAT HE WOULD CONTINUE TO EXACERBATE THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS THAT WE HAVE. SURE IN THE STATE THAT HE WOULD DIE CONTINUE TO. COME. CONTINUE TO RESTRICT OUR HOUSING SUPPLY DOES NOT HELP US WITH OUR HOUSE IS A PLEASURE TO KNOW NUMBER US HAVE. BEEN CHAMPING UP AND DOWN THE STATE AND. IT WOULD ALSO A POTENTIALLY HAVE REVENUE IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM SO I VERY MUCH CHAU LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT. DIALOGUE TODAY I THINK THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THE. PEOPLE AT HOPE WE WOULD HAVE IS THAT WE WOULD HAVE A VERY ON NOW FORTHRIGHT. POLICY DISCUSSION ABOUT THESE BALLOT MEASURE THAT UNFORTUNATELY I GET DEBATED IN THIRTY SECOND COMMERCIALS THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE CAMP. WITH THAT WHILE WE HAVE A REVIEW OF THE INITIATIVE MISTER YOU ARE. WHICH ELECT BEGIN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF GRANULAR WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE BEFORE I GO INTO MY PRESENTATION US MONEY A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT ON OUR OFFICES ROLE IN THE INITIATIVE PROCESS WHICH IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN OUR TRADITIONAL ROLE AND SAY. THE BUDGET OR POLICY PROCESS WHERE WE OFTEN OFFER RECOMMENDATIONS OR COMMENTS ON WHETHER OR NOT A POLICY IS GOOD OR BAD. OUR ROLE IN THE INITIAL PROCESS IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THE VOTERS HAVE PASSED US WITH BEING AN IMPARTIAL OBJECTIVE THIRD PARTY THAT. ASSESSES THE FISCAL EFFECTS OF A MEASURE BUT IN THAT ROLE WE DON'T TAKE POSITIONS ON MEASURES WE DON'T. OFFER COMMENTARY ON THE MERITS OF THE POLICY CHANGES. WE. FOCUS STRICTLY ON ESTIMATING THE MEASURES FISCAL FAX. WITHOUT A MIND. OF A PREPARE TO HAND OUT FOR TODAY'S PRESENTATION I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE IT IN FRONT OF YOU. AND AND ALSO WITH A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND JUST ON CALIFORNIA'S PROPERTY TAX SYSTEM THE PROPERTY TAXES THE SINGLE LARGEST. TAX REVENUE SOURCE FOR LOW GOVERNMENTS IN CALIFORNIA THAT SCHOOL CITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. AND IT RAISES OVER SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR INDIVIDUAL FOR AN INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY OWNER THEIR TAX BILL IS EQUAL TO THEIR TAX RATE TIMES THEIR TAX WILL VALUE OR WHAT'S COMMONLY REFERRED TO THE ASSESSED VALUE. THE TYPICAL TAX RATE IS ONE POINT ONE PERCENT I'M TAXES THE TAX WILL VALUE IS BASED ON THE PURCHASE PRICE OF A HOME. AND. YEAR THE HOMES PURCHASED IT SAID IT'S PURCHASE PRICE AND THEN EACH YEAR THEREAFTER IT'S ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION BY UP TO TWO PERCENT A YEAR. UNDER THIS SYSTEM MOST HOMES ARE TAXED AT A VALUE THAT IS WELL BELOW THEIR MARKET VALUE IN THIS IS BECAUSE. THE MARKET VALUE OF MOST HOMES GROWS A FASTER THAN TWO PERCENT IN MOST YEARS. AND THIS RESULTS IN A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TAXABLE VALUE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF A HOME. AND BECAUSE OF THIS NGUYEN MANY EXISTING HOME BUYERS LOOK TO MOVE TO A DIFFERENT HOME. THEY OFTEN ARE FACED WITH. THE POSSIBILITY OF PAYING HIGHER PROPERTY TAXES IN THAT NEW HOME AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE EXISTING HOME THEY'RE PAYING TAXES BASED ON. TAXABLE VALUE THAT'S BELOW CURRENT MARKET VALUES WHEN THEY BUY THE NEW HOME IT WILL BE ASSESSED AT ITS PURCHASE PRICE WHICH IS REFLECTIVE OF THE CURRENT MARKET VALUES. AND THERE'S SOME RESEARCH BY THAT'S BEEN TO MY OUR OFFICE AND ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS THAT SUGGESTS THAT THIS THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS INCREASE. AND PROPERTY TAXES CAN DISCOURAGE SOME PEOPLE OF FROM SELLING THEIR HOME AND BUYING ANOTHER ONE WHEN THEY MAY OTHERWISE FIND IT AND IT ADVANTAGEOUS TO DO SO. IMPARTIALLY WITH THAT IN MIND. PASSED INITIATIVES HAVE CREATED SOME SPECIAL RULES ALLOW CERTAIN HOMEOWNERS. TO MOVE TO A DIFFERENT HOME WHILE KEEPING THE PROPERTY TAX BILL FOR THE EXISTING HOME. AND TO QUALIFY FOR THESE RULES THE THE NEW HOME HAS TO BE OF EQUAL OR LESSER VALUE. OF THE HOMEOWNER HAS TO BE OVER FIFTY FIVE OR SEVERELY DISABLED OR OWN A PROPERTY THAT WAS AFFECTED BY A NATURAL DISASTER OR CONTAMINATION. THEY'VE US MOVING WITHIN THE COUNTY OR TO A SELECT NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTIES WHERE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAS TAKEN A VOTE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. AND ALLOW SOMEONE TO MOVE ACROSS COUNTY LINES AND BRING THEIR PROPERTY TAX BILL WITH THEM. AND GENERALLY THESE RULES CAN ONLY BE USED. ONCE AND A LIFETIME. OF THIS MEASURE WOULD EXPAND OF THESE US MARSHALS ALLOW THE SERRANO TO HOMEOWNERS I JUST MENTION TO TAKE THEIR PROPERTY TAX BILL WITH THEM TO A DIFFERENT HOME. IT WOULD EXPAND INFORMING WAYS FIRST IT WOULD ALLOW HOMEOWNERS TO MOVE. ANYWHERE WITHIN THE STATE. INCLUDING TO COUNTIES WHERE THE BOARD SUPERVISORS HAS NOT TAKEN THE VOTE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. IT ALLOWS THE A TAX BILL TO BE TRANSFERRED TO A MORE EXPENSIVE HOME WHERE IS RIGHT NOW HAS TO BE HOME OF EQUAL OR LESSER VALUE. IT. IN IT. ALSO REDUCES THE TAXES THAT WOULD BE PAID FOR A HOME A NEWLY PURCHASED HOME THAT IS. OF LESSER VALUE. THAN THE EXISTING HOMEOWNER CURRENT LAW WIN A HOMEOWNER BUYS A NEW HOME THAT IS LESS EXPENSIVE THEIR PROPERTY TAX BILL STAYS THE SAME. UNDER THIS MEASURE THEIR TAX BILL WOULD ACTUALLY GO DOWN. AND FINALLY OF THE MEASURE WOULD A REMOVED THE LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES IN A LIFETIME HOMEOWNER THE HOMEOWNER CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE. OF THE. THESE RULES. ON PAGE THREE OF THE HANDOUT I WALK THROUGH AN EXAMPLETO GIVE AN IDEA ABOUT HOW THESE RULES WOULD WORK. STARTING WITH A A HYPOTHETICAL FIFTY FIVE YEAR OLD COUPLE WHO OWNS A HOME. WITH THE TAXABLE VALUE OF TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND AND A MARKET VALUE OF SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND. DEPARTMENT TAX RATE OF ONE POINT ONE PERCENT. OTHER TAX BILL IS TWENTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. AND THIS COUPLES COUPLE IS CONSIDERING MOVING TO ONE OF TWO HOUSES A MORE EXPENSIVE HOME THAT IS WHERE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND. OR LESS EXPENSIVE HOME IT'S WORTH FOREIGN FIFTY THOUSAND UNDER CURRENT LAW. MOVING TO THE MORE EXPENSIVE HOME THAT HOME. BECAUSE IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THEIR EXISTING HOME IT WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR THE EXISTING RULES AND THEREFORE WOULD BE TAXES PURCHASE PRICE RESULTING. IN THE INCREASE IN THEIR TAX BILL TWO SEVENTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. OF THE LESS EXPENSIVE HOME WOULD CURRENTLY QUALIFY FOR THE RULES AND THEREFORE THEY WOULD KEEP THEIR PROPERTY TAX BILL AT TWENTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. NOW TURNING TO PAGE FOUR. WE SEE HOW THIS WOULD CHANGE UNDER THE PROPOSED MEASURE. WITH THE MORE EXPENSIVE HOME THEIR TAX BILL WOULD INCREASE SOMEWHAT FROM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED TO THIRTY THREE HUNDRED. BUT SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN WHAT IN THE CURRENT LAW WORK GOES TO SEVENTY SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. AND THIS THIRTY THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR. ANNUAL TAX BILL A REFLECTS A THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR TAXABLE VALUE. WHICH IS THE THE PRODUCT OF THIS FORMULA YOU SEE. HERE UNDER THE FIRST BULLET WHICH IS. AS OUTLINED IN THE MEASURE YOU WOULD TAKE THE PRIOR HOMES TAX WILL VALUE. AND ADD TO IT THE DIFFERENCE IN MARKET VALUES BETWEEN THE NEW HOME. AND THE PRIOR HOME. A SECOND WILL YOU CAN SEE THAT. THERE FOR IN BUYING THE LESS EXPENSIVE HOME UNDER THE MEASURE THE HOMEOWNERS TAX BILL WOULD GO DOWN FROM TWENTY TWO HUNDRED. TO ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY IN THIS WOULD. BASED ON A TAX WILL VALUE OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. WHICH IS DERIVED FROM THE SECOND FORMALLY HERE ON PAGE FOUR. WHICH IS GENERALLY TAKING THE PRIOR HOME SEXUAL VALUE. AND MULTIPLYING THAT BY THE RATIO OF THE NEW HOMES MARKET VALUE. DIVIDED BY THE OLD HOMES MARKET VALUE. AND THEN FINALLY TURN TO PAGE FIVE IS A SUMMARY OF OUR. ESTIMATE OF THE MEASURES FISCAL FAX I'M BEFORE GOING INTO THE DETAILS I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT. WE ARE STILL FINALIZING THE ESTIMATES THAT WILL APPEAR IN THE VOTER GUIDE IN THE VOTING MATERIALS FOR NOVEMBER THE NUMBERS THAT ARE REFLECTED HERE ARE BASED ON THE ANALYSIS THAT WE UNDERTOOK IN THE FALL FOR THE TITLE AND SUMMARY STAGE IN NUMBERS THAT WENT OUT AS PART OF THE. PETITIONS THAT WERE PRESENTED TO VOTERS. SO WITH THAT IN MIND WE FIND THAT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FISCAL AFFECT OF THE MEASURE IS A REDUCTION IN PROPERTY TAX REVENUES. TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. IN THE FIRST YEARS WE ESTIMATE THAT SCHOOLS AND OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD EACH LOSE A OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND THAT THESE LOSSES WOULD GROW OVER TIME. I'LL PROBABLY REACHING AROUND A BILLION DOLLARS. A YEAR. THESE LOSSES ARE THE THE NET EFFECT OF A COUPLE OF MOVING PIECES. ARE ON THE NEGATIVE SIDE. YOU HAVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF HOMEBUYERS EACH YEAR ARE MADE UP BY THOSE WHO ARE OVER FIFTY FIVE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN. A QUARTER AND A THIRD OF HOME BUYERS IN RECENT YEARS ARE OVER FIFTY FIVE. AND THAT MEANS THERE ARE SOMEWHERE AROUND EIGHTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. HOMEBUYERS WHO ARE POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE FOR A TAX BREAK UNDER THIS INITIATIVE. AND ONLY A MINORITY OF THOSE HOME BUYERS ARE RECEIVING. A TAX BREAK UNDER THE CURRENT RULES SO THAT MEANS WE GET SICK A SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION. OF. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT TAX BREAK WHICH WOULD MEAN THEY BE PAYING LESS PROPERTY TAXES WHICH MAY IN TURN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD RECEIVE LESS REVENUE. ON THE OTHER SIDE. THERE'S SOME THERE'S SOME EVIDENCE THAT WHEN HOMEOWNERS RECEIVE A PROPERTY TAX SAVINGS THAT CAN RESULT IN AN INCREASE AND HOME PRICES IN THERE'S A FEW REASONS FOR THIS BUT JUST IN GENERAL. IF YOU THINK. IF YOU THINK ABOUT A HOME BUYER THEY HAVE A CERTAIN BUDGET THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY FOR A HOUSE. AND THAT INCLUDES IN THAT BUDGET IS HOW MUCH THEY HAVE TO SET ASIDE EACH YEAR FOR THEIR ANNUAL PROPERTY TAX PAYMENT. IF THE AMOUNT THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR PROPERTY TAXES GOES DOWN. THAT MIGHT MAKE THEM WILLING TO PAY LITTLE BIT MORE IN TERMS OF THE PRICE OF THE HOUSE OR IT COULD TAKE SOMEONE WHO'S ON THE MARGIN OF BEING A HOME BUYER. MAYBE THEY CAN'T QUITE AFFORD IT IF THE PROPERTY TAXES COME DOWN A LITTLE BIT THAN PURCHASING THAT HOUSE MAY FALL INTO THEIR BUDGET SO IT COULD. ENCOURAGE MORE HOME BUYERS. TO BUY HOMES. THERE'S BEEN SOME RESEARCH TRYING TO MEASURE THE EFFECT OF PROJECT SAVINGS ON HOME PRICES. ONE STUDY TRYING TO LOOK AT THE EFFECT OF THE SAVINGS A PROP THIRTEEN IN GENERAL SUGGESTS THAT. EACH DOLLAR PROPERTY TAX SAVINGS RELATES TO SEVEN DOLLAR INCREASE IN AGGREGATE PROPERTY VALUES AND THAT. TRANSLATES INTO SEVEN CENTS MORE PROPERTY TAXES SO FOR EACH DOLLAR OF PROPERTY TAX SAVINGS OR FROM A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PERSPECTIVE. A PROPERTY TAX REVENUE REDUCTION A YOU MIGHT HAVE AN OFFSETTING AFFECT SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SEVEN CENTS OF OF AN OFFSETTING INCREASE FROM THIS HOME PRICE AFFECT. ALSO SOME OFFSETTING EFFECT BUT STILL SMALL RELATIVE TO THE TO THE MAGNITUDE OF THE LOSSES. AND THE STATE DOES NOT RECEIVE A PROPERTY TAXES DIRECTLY BUT THE STATE'S BUDGET WOULD BE. IMPACTED BY THIS MEASURE. OF BECAUSE STATE LAW GUARANTEES SCHOOLS A CERTAIN LEVEL FUNDING THROUGH A COMBINATION OF STATE GENERAL FUND IN PROPERTY TAXES. AND. WIN PROPERTY TAXES FOR SCHOOLS GO DOWN. THEN THAT MEANS THAT STAGE OFTEN ALLOCATIONS OF SCHOOLS HAVE TO GO UP TO MAKE UP. THE DIFFERENCE. AND THEN JUST BRIEFLY A FEW OTHER SMALLER FISCAL EFFECTS FROM THE MEASURE OF THE MEASURE WOULD LIKELY RESULT AND. SOME INCREASE IN PROPERTY TRANSFER TAX REVENUES. THE INCREASE IN INCOME TAXES FROM A PRIMARILY FROM INCREASED CAPITAL GAINS FROM HOME SALES. AND. HIGHER ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR COUNTY ASSESSORS ESPECIALLY. AND THIS THIS COULD BE IS ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT AND THE SHORT TERM AS COUNTY ASSESSORS TRIED TO KIND OF ESTABLISH THE MAKE. TAKE ON THE ONE TIME EXERCISE OF ESTABLISHING THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO ADMINISTER THIS MEASURE. AND WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE IN QUESTION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. MISTER POPE. I HAVE A COMMENT. I SUPPORT THIS. ON A TABLE. I'M A BABY BOOMER. WHEN I'M DONE WITH THIS GIG. UNLESS I HAVE SOME LIKE THIS ON THE BOOKS I'M BROKEN. ALSO EVERYTHING GET OUT OF. DODGE I GET OUT OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I'M PAYING THIRTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT. STATE TAX. OKAY AMBIENT TAXED INTO THE GROUND. SO. IF I CAN. DON'T SIZE. THEY KEEP MY PROPERTY TAX. LEVEL. I MIGHT STICK AROUND. BUT IF I DON'T GET TO. ADIOS AMIGO I'LL BE GONE DO YOU. ALRIGHT. OR LOS VEGAS LOT OF BABY BOOMERS ARE GOING LAS VEGAS IS ONE OF THE. MAIN STATES THAT EVERYONE'S MOVING TO. SO. THE POINT I'M MAKING TO THIS COMMITTEE IS. CUT. US. OLD PEOPLE SOME SLACK. OKAY BECAUSE IT WILL JUST LEAVE. AND WE HAVE NINETEEN WHAT POINT NINETEEN POINT SIX MILLION POOR PEOPLE IN IN THIS STATE. I WANT TO KEEP SOME OF THE RICH GUYS HERE. AND I. AM RICH WOMEN. OKAY. BECAUSE THEY CONTROL FIFTY SIX PERCENT OF THE WEALTH. SO THAT'S MY POINT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. MISTER CHIU. THANK YOU I I TO THE QUESTION UNDER REDUCE PROPERTY TAX REVENUE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT DATA AGGREGATED AMOUNT. WHILE CALL OF. IT'S CORRECT OKAY BECAUSE I CAN SEE SOME BENEFIT TO. OF. AREA OF HIGHER CALLS THE REAL ESTATE MARKET. THEN AND IF THE THAT GOAL OF THEIR OLD. HOUSE. YOU NO THAT AND DIDN'T NEW BUYERS AND UP A MUCH HIGHER PROP. SO FOR THAT COUNTY. DID IT PROBABLY WILL SEE IT INCOME. BUT IF THE DEAD DEAD DEAD DEAD FIRE MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTY. AND CARRIED THAT EXCEPTION WITH THEM. SO DATA BUYING COUNTY MAY BE LOSING SOME OF THE PROPERTY TAX. BUT THE SELLING DID DID DID THE COUNTY WHERE HE'D SOLD HIS THIRTY YOUR OWN HOME. PROBABLY WOULD IN JURY OF MUCH HIGHER PROPERTY TAX BECAUSE A NEW BUYER WILL HAVE TO PAY A MUCH HIGHER PROPERTY TAX. I THINK THAT'S. THAT'S CORRECT IN CONCEPT I THINK THOUGH YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT KIND OF BOTH SIDES OF THE TRANSACTION THE YOU WERE MENTIONING THAT. THIS BUYER WILL SELL THEIR HOUSE RIGHT AND THAT WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE IN THE ASSESSMENT FOR THAT HOUSE BUT THEN THEY'LL BE MOVING TO ANOTHER HOUSE AND THEY'LL BE TAKING THEIR ASSESSMENT WITH THEM AND THAT WILL BE ESSENTIALLY A A A REDUCTION IN THE ASSESSED VALUE IN THE. ASSESSMENT INCREASE THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE OCCURRED IF SOMEONE ELSE SAID AND PURCHASE THAT HOUSE RIGHT BUT I I THINK YOUR POINT STILL REMAINS THAT TO THE EXTENT. THAT IF THERE ARE TWO COUNTIES WHERE YOU HAVE A SIGNIFICANT FLOW OUT OF ONE COUNTY INTO ANOTHER COUNTY THAT YOU COULD HAVE SOME THERE COULD BE SOME DIFFERENTIAL ACROSS THOSE COUNTIES IN TERMS OF HOW THE FISCAL AFFECTS PLAY OUT. I THINK WE WERE LOOKING AT THE DATA WE DIDN'T SEE THAT THERE WERE A LOT OF INSTANCES WHERE THERE WERE HUGE IMBALANCES ACROSS COUNTIES IN TERMS OF PEOPLE. YOU KNOW A SIGNIFICANT DISPROPORTION AMOUNT OF PEOPLE LEAVING ONE COUNTING GOING TO ANOTHER PARTICULAR COUNTY. ENOUGH THAT THAT IT YOU KNOW THAT THOSE FISCAL EFFECTS WOULD VARY. GREATLY ACROSS COUNTY LINES. BUT I I THINK IN IN GENERAL. THERE. THERE COULD BE SOME OF THOSE KIND OF DIFFERENT EFFECTS ACROSS COUNTIES YOU RIGHT. NO THANK YOU. I THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING. I I THINK I'M TO PIGGYBACK OFF MY ARMY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE'S POINT I MEAN. I I HAVE THE OPPOSITE CONCERN THAT YOU HAVE AREAS THAT CONTINUE TO BE HIGHLY DESIRABLE IN TERMS OF REAL ESTATE WHICH IS COASTAL CALIFORNIA. OUT WHEN I WAS THE COUNTY ASSESSOR SAN FRANCISCO I GOT NUMEROUS CALLS ABOUT PEOPLE WANTING TO MOVE INTO. SAN FRANCISCO THIS THIS WOULD ALLOW IT IN ESSENCE ON SENIOR RESEARCHERS ARE VERY WEALTHY. COLLEAGUE FROM SANTEE UMP TO BE ABLE TO COME INTO. SAN FRANCISCO UNDERCUT THE COMPETITION WHICH WOULD BE PEOPLE AT MY AGE I BOUGHT ARE NOT THAT MUCH YOUNGER THAN MISTER VOEPEL. BUT. THAT PEOPLE ARE AT MY AGE LEVEL WILL BE AT A DISADVANTAGE HE COULD ACTUALLY. PAY A HIGHER PRICE BID A HIGHER PRICE BECAUSE HE HAD A LOWER TAX BASE. IS SO ARM DID THIS IS EXTRAORDINARILY CONCERNING I THINK THIS WOULD BE. THIS WHICH FURTHER EXACERBATE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND IN THE COAST COASTAL PART OF CALIFORNIA I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE WOULD INCREASE AT EXETER STORE. ENCOURAGING NEXT IS I THINK QUITE THE OPPOSITE IT WOULD MEAN THAT PEOPLE WHO. AYE IN ESSENCE COULD. FEEL LIKE THEY COULD AFFORD COASTAL CALIFORNIA COLSON MAYBE IT LOOK AT SANTA MONICA OR LONG BEACH OR. YOU KNOW WEST LA. IN ALL THIS AND FIND OUT MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE BECAUSE. THEY COULD. TRANSFER THEIR NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE YEAR PROPERTY TAX. WHICH WOULD MAKE IT MUCH MORE ON ACCEPTABLE FINANCIAL. YES THANK YOU COULD YOU JUST UP. WALK THROUGH. ONE MORE TIME THE IMPACT ON A SCHOOL FUNDING THAT'S ONE OF MY MAIN CONCERNS. BUT I I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HERE IS THAT WE'RE. LIKELY REDUCE. THE ABILITY TO FUND SCHOOLS ON THE LOCAL LEVEL IN THE EXPECTATION WOULD BE THAT THE STATE WOULD BACK FILL. THOSE DOLLARS STARTING AT A HUNDRED MILLION AND THEN WRAPPING UP TO. A BILLION AND THEN PROBABLY MORE. LONGER TERM YES SO THAT'S TRUE IN IN GENERAL SO IN GENERAL A STATE LAW CURRENTLY DICTATES THAT EACH SCHOOL RECEIVED A CERTAIN MINIMUM LEVEL FUNDING. THROUGH A COMBINATION OF STATE FUNDING AND LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES. SO IT FOR MOST SCHOOLS OF THEIR PROPERTY TAXES GO DOWN AS A RESULT OF THIS MEASURE THEY WILL BE ESSENTIALLY. MADE WHOLE WITH ADDITIONAL STATE GENERAL FUND NOW A COUNTY OUT TO THAT IS THERE ARE. ABOUT FIVE PERCENT OF SCHOOLS THAT RECEIVE. ENOUGH PROPERTY TAXES THAT IS THAT ACTUALLY THE BASIC EIGHT SCHOOLS THAT EXCEEDS THEIR MINIMUM GUARANTEE AND SO THEY DON'T RECEIVE ANY STATE FUNDING AT ALL OR THEY RECEIVE. A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF STATE FUNDING AND SO. PROPER TALKS LOSSES FOR THOSE SCHOOLS WOULD BE WOULD HAVE A THOSE SCHOOLS WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING. SO SO TWO POINTS AND YOU WHEN YOU SAY MADE WHOLE MONEY STILL GOT TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE. SAMI'S YOU'RE NOT TAKING OUT A LOCAL BUDGET YOUR THEN DIPPING INTO THE STATE BUDGET AND THAT WOULD GIVE SHRINK. POTENTIALLY SHRINK THE DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR OTHER SERVICES. WITH WITH THIS ULTIMATELY IN THE LONG TERM. SHOULD A SHRINK THE NUMBER OF BASIC EIGHT DISTRICTS. IT. IT POTENTIALLY COULD. IT'S SIMPLE TO SAY IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE LOOKED AT IN DETAIL. BUT THE I THINK IF THERE WERE DISTRICTS THAT WERE. ON THAT KIND OF ON THE MARGIN OF BEING BASIC AID THAT THAT THE EFFECT OF THIS MEASURE IN THE LONG TERM COULD POTENTIALLY PUSH THEM BACK TO BEING. NOT NOT BASIC INTO HIS I THINK SOME DISTRICTS GO BASIC GAVE THEM COME OUT THEY GO BACK AND. SO I THINK THIS IS MADE MAYBE GET A FORCE FAR OUT. OF BEING BASICALLY A DISTRICTS AGAIN I JUST WANT TO MAKE THE POINT OF THE MONEY HAS TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE. OUR SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY IN A RADICALLY UNDER FUNDED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA PUT GREATER BURDEN ON THE STATE FROM THE LOCALS IT'S NOT IT'S NOT JUST FREE MONEY IT'S GOING TO IT'S GOING TO MEAN LESS DOLLARS FOR OTHER SERVICES AND MAYBE EVEN ULTIMATELY SCHOOLS THEMSELVES OF THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M. KIND OF GRAPPLING WITH WHAT EXACTLY THE IMPACT ON TAX REVENUES WOULD BE BECAUSE I KNOW. THAT YOU SAID IN THE SHORT TERM WE CAN CALCULATE WHAT THOSE WOULD BE BECAUSE WE CAN ESTIMATE HOW MUCH TAX BASIS. PEOPLE IN THE OVER FIFTY FIVE CATEGORY HAVE IN THEIR HOMES WE CAN MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THEM WOULD MOVE. AS WE GOT HONORED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE SHORT TERM GROWING TO POTENTIALLY A BILLION DOLLARS IN THE LONG TERM ANNUALLY RIGHT. SO. BUT THEN WE'VE GOT THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WILL INCREASE TAX REVENUE FOR EXAMPLE SO. THAT PEOPLE WHO. WOULD NOT HAVE MOVED UNDER CURRENT LAW COULD MAKE THE DECISION TO MOVE. THEY MAY SEE A DECREASE IN PROPERTY TAX BUT THEY'LL HAVE CAPITAL GAINS TAX ON. THE. THE SALE OF THE HOME ALSO THEY'LL BE DOCUMENT TRANSFER TAXES ASSESSED. AND THEN THERE'S THE MARKET. OF GREATER COMPETITION FOR HOMES WHICH DRIVES HIGHER PRICES. WHICH LEADS TO HIGHER PROPERTY TAX VALUATIONS FOR PEOPLE EVEN OUTSIDE OF THE OVER FIFTY FIVE CATEGORY SO YOU PUT ALL THAT TOGETHER AND. I MEAN I'M I'M I'M I'M AT A LOSS TO YOU KNOW WAS WEARING WHERE THAT NETS OUT. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE ONLY CONCRETE NUMBERS WE HAD ON THE REVENUE LOSS SIDE WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCRETE NUMBERS ON THE REVENUE GAINS SIDE. SO BRING CAN YOU SHED SOME LIGHT ON ENERGY WHICH WE JUST HAVE TO CONCLUDE WE DON'T KNOW. SURE LET ME. LET ME SPEAKS TO THOSE AFFECTION MENTION LET ME START WITH THE THE KIND OF BROUGHT HOME PRICE APPRECIATION. A POINT WHICH. AYE SO AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THERE IS SOME RESEARCH THAT SUGGESTS THAT WHEN HOMEOWNERS RECEIVE PROPERTY TAX SAVINGS IT DOES. KIND OF THE TERM OF ART IS IT GETS CAPITALIZED INTO HOME PRICES THAT HAD KINDA IT INCREASES THE WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR HOMES. ON THAT SHOWS UP IN IN HIGHER HOME PRICES AND SO. OTHER HAS BEEN SOME PAST RESEARCH THAT SUGGESTS THAT EACH DOLLAR OF PROPERTY TAX SAVINGS THERE IS. THERE IS AN OFFSETTING. PROPERTY VALUE PER SHE ASIAN THAT RESULTS IN SOMEWHERE AROUND. SEVEN CENTS OF ADDITIONAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUE SO THERE'S SOME OFFSETTING EFFECT BUT IT'S RELATIVELY MINOR IN TERMS OF THE. RESULT PROPERTY TAX SAVINGS. ON THE POINT OF PROPERTY TAX. TRANSFER AND CAPITAL GAINS. BOTH OF THOSE EFFECTS. DRIVE OFF OF ANY ADDITIONAL HOME SALES THAT MAKER THAT SOMEONE MAY BE ENCOURAGED BY THE PASSES OF JUSTIN OF THIS MEASURE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE SOLD THEIR HOME AND MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE OTHERWISE BUT. NOW THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING THIS TAX BENEFIT THEY MAY DO SO. AND SO THE MAGNITUDE OF THOSE AFFECTS DOES DEPEND ON JUST HOW MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE WOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO MOVE. OUR ESTIMATE IN THE AT THE TITLE AND SUMMARY STAGES THAT EACH OF THOSE BOTH THAT THE PROPERTY TRANSFER REVENUES AND THE CAPITAL GAINS. COULD INCREASE BY. IN THE TO SEE INCREASES IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS. AND THAT'S BASED ON. BOTH SOME OF STATISTICAL MODELING THAT OUR OFFICE IS DONE. AND ALSO PASSED ACADEMIC RESEARCH THAT WE WERE ESSENTIALLY. MIRRORING OTHERS ATTEMPTED TO ESTIMATE THE KIND OF THE BEHAVIORAL FACTS OF HOW MUCH PEOPLE RESPONDED TO THE AND AN INCENTIVE CREATED BY THE THAT THE SPECIAL RULES THAT ARE THERE IN PLACE NOW FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE MOVING. PEOPLE OVER FIFTY FIVE REMOVING TO HOME OF EQUAL OR LESSER VALUE. THERE HAS BEEN SOME PAST RESEARCH BY OUR OFFICE AND OTHER ACADEMICS IT IS TRIED TO MEASURE. JUST HOW MUCH IS THAT HOW BIG IS THAT BEHAVIORAL FACT. I WE SAID THAT MAYBE OUR ESTIMATE WAS MAYBE IT COULD BE A FEW. A FEW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF AN INCREASE AND. ADDITIONAL MOVES BUT YOU HAVE TO WEIGH THAT AGAINST. THE FACT THAT THERE'S SOMEWHERE AROUND EIGHTY THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OVER FIFTY FIVE HOME BUYERS NOW WE'RE MOVING. AND NOT RECEIVING ANY TAX BREAK AT ALL SO WE THINK THAT THE THAT THE FOLKS WHO WOULD. ESSENTIALLY WHO ARE MOVING NOW NOT IN RESPONSE TO THIS MEASURE BUT WOULD BE GETTING A TAX BENEFIT ANYWAY. THAT THAT AFFECTS. IS ENOUGH TO. KIND OF A. MORE THAN COVER ANY OF THOSE OTHER ADDITIONAL OR REVENUE GAINS FROM THE THE OTHER PIECES MATHIS ON LET ME SUMMARIZE WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY SO REALLY WORK WE'RE GUESSING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE LEDGER RIGHT. WE'RE GUESSING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO. I WOULD CHOOSE TO MOVE UNDER THE NEW PROPOSED LAW THAT WOULD WOULD NOT CHOOSE TO MOVE OTHERWISE AND THEN WE'RE GUESSING OUT. LA ON THE POSITIVE SIDE THE LEDGER WHAT WHAT EFFECTS THAT THAT WOULD HAVE ON OUR. PART TAX REVENUES FROM CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND AND PROPERTY APPRECIATION SO BOB BUT. WHEN WE TOTAL ALL THE GUESSES YOU THINK IT'S NOT A NET REVENUE LOSS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. YEAH I MEAN I THINK THAT ANY ANY EXERCISE OF DOING A FISCAL CEMENT INVOLVES. I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY GUESSING OR MAKING. TO ATTEMPTS TO MAKE EDUCATED US DEMANDS OF THE VARIOUS MOVING PIECES I THINK. ONE THING THAT I WOULD SAY THOUGH IS THAT OF THE VARIOUS SORT OF ESTIMATES THERE WERE HAVING TO DO I THINK THAT THE ONE. THAT IS BOTH THE BIGGEST AND PROBABLY THE CLEAREST AND EASIEST ESTIMATE IS THE THE PIECE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY MOVING NOW UNDER CURRENT LAW. WHO ARE RECEIVING A TAX BENEFIT AND WILL IF THE MEASURE PASSES SO THAT ONE IT IN IN MY MIND PROBABLY INVOLVE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF ASSUMPTIONS OUR ESTIMATION THAT HOUSE TO GO INTO IT? THE OTHER PIECES I MEAN SURE I I DON'T THINK. WE OR ANYONE ELSE CAN ESTIMATE WITH EXACT PRECISION HOW MANY ADDITIONAL PEOPLE ARE GONNA MOVE UNDER THIS MEASURE I THINK WE DID WE DID WHAT I FEEL LIKE IS. ARE DUE DILIGENCE IN ATTEMPTING TO. DO. YOU KNOW SOME WORKED ESTIMATE THAT AND LOOK AT PAST ACADEMIC RESEARCH BUT. YOU'RE RIGHT NOBODY NOBODY KNOWS FOR SURE. EXACTLY WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHILE YOU'RE A EVEN THOUGH WE'RE GUESSING YOU'VE CONVINCED ME THAT IT'S AN EDUCATED GUESS. THANK YOU. SITTING. I THINK IT'S A JUST A FALL FROM MY COLLEAGUE FROM PAPER SO IF IF I HEARD YOU. CORRECTLY YOU HAVE. A CERTAIN GROUP OF PEOPLE ALREADY FIFTY FIVE AND OLDER WHO ARE MOVING. ANYWAYS REGARDLESS OF THIS TAX BREAK OR NOT AND AND FROM WHAT I HEARD YOU SAY YOU'RE GIVING THEM A TAX BREAK THAT THEY HAVEN'T ASKED FOR NOR NEED TO. TO MOVE BECAUSE ALREADY MOVING ANYWAYS SO YOU KNOW BASED ON THAT HOW BIG A BREAK THAT THE BEGINNING FOR BEHAVIOR THAT THEY'RE READY EXHIBIT. THAT THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN I THINK THAT. THAT THAT IS WHAT MAKES UP MOST OF THE. THE NUMBERS YOU'RE SEEING HERE IS ESSENTIALLY THAT TAX BENEFIT THAT'S BEING PROVIDED TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOVING ALREADY. AND WE DO HAVE IT SAMPLE IN LAW NOW OF COUNTIES THAT CAN DO THIS SO WE DO HAVE A GUESSTIMATE OF HOW MANY PEOPLE DO UTILIZE IT. THINK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE UP. I JUST WANT TO ASK ONE QUESTION. BECAUSE I'M OBVIOUSLY IN TO THE MEETINGS AND SUPPOSED BE AND RIGHT NOW I'M GETTING MESSAGES. WHY WOULD WE DO THIS? I I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AND AND AND BECAUSE. I MEAN WE WE HAVE PROBLEMS WHO ATTACKS IN MOON GOT PROP THIRTEEN INSTEAD OF DOING ONE THING HIT THE WHOLE PROBLEM HAMMER WHO STILL HAVE PROBLEMS WITH IT. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH TRYING TO SOLVE. THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN I UNDERSTAND WHAT WHY HOW IT OPERATES. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE ACTUALLY TRYING TO SOLVE. ED THAT'S GOING TO CREATE ALL THESE OTHER PROBLEMS THAT I SEE JUST JUST QUICKLY THIS IS NOT A PROPONENT THIS IS THE LA ALSO JUST SO YEAH AREAS AND OFF AREAS. WHAT HE WAS DOING THE RESEARCH SHOWS I'M TRYING TO FIGURE WILL PROBABLY THEY GIVE TO YOU TO TRY TO SOLVE? SO AS I MENTIONED IN KIND OF MY OPEN MY OPENING COMMENTS. OUR OFFICE AS A BIT OF A. A DIFFERENT ROLE THAN OUR TRADITIONAL ROLE IN DEVISING IN THE BUDGET OF THE POLICY THAT CAPACITY IN THIS ROLE THE VOTERS HAVE PASSED US WITH BEING IMPARTIAL OBJECTIVE AND FOCUSING SOLELY ON THE FISCAL AWESOME AND SO ALL THAT IS TO SAY. I THINK IT PRIOR TO DEFER YOUR QUESTION TO THE PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS WHEN THEY COME OUT KIND OF DISCUSS. WHAT THEY SEE IS THE PROBLEM THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THIS BUDGET IS SOON AS AS SOON AS WE? TAKE A SELLER MELENDEZ QUESTION WILL BRING THE PROPONENTS OF SO WE CAN SILICON ASSET FOR YOU. SO MEMORABLE AND. THANK YOU AM I HAVE A QUESTION. DO YOU. DO YOU THINK THAT THIS POLICY CHANGE. WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE HOUSING SHORTAGE THAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING IN CALIFORNIA. BUT. SO I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME POTENTIAL THAT ARE GOING BACK TO THE POINT THAT I WAS MAKING BEFORE THAT A WIN. HOMEOWNERS RECEIVE PROBABLY TAX SAVINGS. THEY THAT CAN ULTIMATELY RESULT IN SOME INCREASE AND HOME PRICES DOWN THE LINE AND DESCRIBE THAT MECHANISM FEW TIME. THAT. INCREASE IN HOME PRICES. ESPECIALLY MAYBE IN CERTAIN COUNTIES THAT ARE. TOP DESTINATIONS FOR THESE RETIREES. MAY ENCOURAGE SOME DEVELOPERS TO BUILD ADDITIONAL HOUSING. WHEN WE LOOK TO THAT EFFECT WE THINK THAT PROBABLY THAT WOULD BE RELATIVELY SMALL. COMPARED TO THE SCALE OF OVERALL DEVELOPMENT IN THE STATE. INCREASING IN YOU KNOW BY YOU KNOW OUR BEST GUESS WAS PROBABLY LESS THAN A PERCENT A YEAR. SO. IT MAY BE THERE COULD BE SOME MODEST INCREASE IN CONSTRUCTION. BUT YOU KNOW MAYBE PROBABLY NOT SIGNIFICANT. THANK YOU MR BLUE. XIN OKAY. RIGHT ANYMORE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER BOYER I PROPONENTS COMING M. CRIST'S. CHRISTOPHER CARLISLE AND MISTER BILL HIM PLEASE. CHRIS FOR CARLISLE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION REALTORS THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS A HOUSING SUPPLY PROBLEM. WE BELIEVE A PARTIAL SOLUTION ONE THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE MORE EFFICIENT USE OF OUR EXISTING HOUSING STOCK. IS THE PROPERTY TAX FAIRNESS INITIATIVE SPONSORED BY THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBER CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. THERE ARE MANY BABY BOOMERS WHO WOULD LIKE TO MOVE FROM THEIR LARGE VAMPED SINGLE FAMILY HOME. NOW THAT THEIR CHILDREN HAVE MOVED OUT. THERE HOMES NO LONGER MEET THEIR NEEDS AND THERE'S INTEREST IN DOWNSIZING OR MOVING CLOSER TO CHILDREN OR GRANDCHILDREN. MANY WHO WANT TO MOVE FEEL LOCKED IN PLACE SINCE THEY KNOW THAT THEY FACE A SIZEABLE INCREASE IN THEIR PROPERTY TAXES IF THEY MOVED TO A NEW HOME. PERHAPS DOUBLE OR TRIPLE. THE CURRENT TAX BILL. THEY ARE KEPT FROM MOVING TO A MORE SUITABLE DWELLING BECAUSE OF THE SUBSTANTIAL MOVING PENALTY THEY FACE. ALMOST SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL SENIOR HOMEOWNERS HAVE NOT MOVED IN THE CENTURY ANOTHER WHICH THEY HAVEN'T MOVED SINCE THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND. AND ALMOST HALF HAVE BEEN IN THEIR HOMES FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY. NOW WE HAVE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN WHICH SETS A HOMEOWNER'S PROPERTY TAXES THAT ONE PERCENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE. IF A HOMEOWNER MOVES THEIR TAXES ARE BASED ON THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE NEW HOPE. SO EVEN IF THEY MOVE TO HOME OF EQUAL VALUE THEIR PROPERTY TAXES WILL GO UP. NOW PROP SIXTY ALLOWS TRANSFERS FOR SENIOR HOMEOWNERS WITHIN A COUNTY BUT THE HOME MUST BE OF EQUAL OR LESSER VALUE. AND PROP NINETY ALLOWS TRANSFERS TO OTHER COUNTIES BUT ONLY ELEVEN COUNTIES HAVE AGREED TO ACCEPT SOME TRANCERS. AND ONLY A SINGLE TRANSFER IS ALLOWED. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SPONSORED THE PROPERTY TAX FAIRNESS INITIATIVE. WENT PASSED IT WILL ELIMINATE THE MOVING PELLETS FOR SENIORS THOSE FIFTY FIVE AND OLDER WHO WISH TO MOVE TO SAFER. MORE PRACTICAL HOMES OR HOMES CLOSER TO FAMILY MEMBERS. THE FINN IF IT'S ALSO APPLY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOME DUE TO A NATURAL DISASTER. THE INITIATIVE PROVIDES FOR ELIGIBLE HOMEOWNERS THAT THEIR CURRENT PROPERTY TAX BASE WILL BE TRANSFERRED. ONE WHEN THEY PURCHASE ANOTHER HOME IT ANY OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. TWO REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY TIMES THEY MOVE AND THREE REGARDLESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE REPLACEMENT HOME. IF A HOME IF A HOMEOWNER IS HAS TO PURCHASE A MORE EXPENSIVE HOME. WHICH CAN OFTEN HAPPEN WHEN DOWNSIZING THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY PROPERTY TAXES ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SALES PRICE OF THEIR ORIGINAL RESIDENTS. AND THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE REPLACEMENT RESIDENTS. THEY GET TO KEEP THEIR PROP THIRTEEN SAVINGS. AND SO WHAT WE DO IS WE COMBINED THOSE TIPS LET ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE. LET'S SAY YOU BOUGHT AT A HUNDRED THOUSAND NOW TWENTY YEARS LATER YOU'RE SELLING A TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND. AND YOU BY UP TO THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. THAT'S SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO FIFTY AND THE THREE TWENTY FIVE WILL BE ADDED TO THE ORIGINAL ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR TAX BASE. SO NOW YOU HAVE A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR TAX BASE. FOUR HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED THREE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR HOME WHAT I WANT YOU TO NOTICE IS. THAT THOSE TAXES OR THE SAME EXACTLY THE SAME AS IF THE HOMEOWNER HAVE PURCHASED A HOME OF EQUAL VALUE. THIS. WAY THAT WE'RE CALCULATING THAT NEW A PROPERTY TAX BASE ASSURES THAT THE HOMEOWNER WILL STILL PAY FOR HIS OR HER FOR HIS OR HER FAIR SHARE A PROPERTY TAXES. BUT THEY WILL BE PROTECTED FROM LARGE INCREASES IN THEIR TAX BILL. NO AS I MENTION THESE BENEFITS WOULD APPLY TO THE SEVERELY DISABLED AND TO THOSE WHO LOST THEIR HOME IN A DISASTER SUCH AS THE TIMES FIRE LAST OCTOBER IN NAPA SO NO MY AND LAKE COUNTIES. OR THE THOMAS FIRE THAT DESTROYED PARTS OF THE TOUR AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTIES LAST DECEMBER JANUARY. IT WOULD ALLOW VICTIMS WHO LIVE IN AREAS LIKE THESE. THAT HAVE BEEN OFFICIALLY DECLARED DISASTER BY THE GOVERNOR TO MOVE ANYWHERE IN THE STATE WITHOUT PAYING THE MOVING PENALTY. BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING TOO MANY WOULD BE HOME BUYERS FEEL THEY WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO PURCHASE A HOME. THIS MEASURE IS NOT ONLY ABOUT TAX FAIRNESS FOR SENIORS BUT ALSO ABOUT CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOMEOWNERSHIP BY INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES. IN ESTABLISHED NEIGHBORHOODS. THIS INITIATIVE INCREASES THE ABILITY OF YOUNG FAMILIES TO BUY HOMES. THUS STRENGTHENING NEIGHBORHOODS AND AREA SCHOOLS THAT MAY BE FACING DECLINING ENROLLMENT. NOW THERE'S LITTLE UARREL ABOUT ALLOWING SENIORS THE DISABLED AND OTHERS TO MOVE ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE WHEN THEY NEED TO DO SO. THE ONLY ISSUE IS THE LA OWES ESTIMATED COST OF THIS PROPOSAL. TO THAT END THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS HAS SECURED THE SERVICES OF THE BERKELEY RESEARCH GROUP WHICH IS COMPOSED OF FORMER. DIRECTOR OF FINANCE SENATOR TOM CAMPBELL AND DOCTOR BILL HIM. DR HAVE IS HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS HOW WE DYNAMIC FISCAL ANALYSIS OF THE INITIATIVE REVEALS THAT THE INITIATIVE WILL NOT COST WHAT IS BEEN PREDICTED TO COST. DOCTOR HIM. WELCOME DOCTOR HIM. THANK YOU. YEAH. HAD CHAIRS AND MEMBERS. GOOD AFTERNOON. THANKS FOR HAVING ME. I AM NOT AN ADVOCATE OR AN OPPONENT OF THIS MEASURE I WAS RETAINED BY THE REALTORS TO DO AN OBJECTIVE AND INDEPENDENT FISCAL ASSESSMENT OF THE MEASURE. ALONG WITH TOM CAMPBELL. AND AS MR YOU'LL ARE PROPERLY POINTED OUT THIS MEASURE WILL HAVE BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCES. AFTER REVIEWING THE EVIDENCE ANALYZING THE MEASURE. DOCTOR CAMPBELL AND I ARE OF THE OPINION THAT ON A NET BASIS THIS MEASURE OF ITS ENACTED AND IMPLEMENTED. WILL COME PRETTY CLOSE TO PAYING FOR ITSELF THAT THE ADDITIONAL REVENUES IT GENERATES. WILL. A COME CLOSE TO OFFSETTING REVENUE LOSSES THAT WE CERTAINLY ALL AGREE ARE BUILT INTO THIS MEASURE. THE NATIONAL REVENUES ARE GOING TO COME FROM TWO SOURCES ONE OF WHICH I THINK IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED AT THIS HEARING THE OTHER HAS NOT BEEN. THE FIRST IS THAT. THE MEASURE WILL CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE MORE HOMEOWNERS AGE FIFTY FIVE AND OLDER. TO SELL THEIR CURRENT RESIDENCES AND BUY MORE SUITABLE RESIDENCES. MORE SUITABLE TO THEIR STAGE OF LIFE. THEIR FAMILY SIZE HERE NEED TO BE CLOSE TO JOBS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. ANOTHER REASON IT WILL ENCOURAGE MORE SALES IS. BECAUSE IT WILL ALLOW HOMEOWNERS TO TAKE THEIR CURRENT ASSESSED VALUE WITH THEM TO THEIR NEW HOME. AND AS THEY MOVE OUT. THAT WILL FREE UP SPACE. A LOT OF SQUARE FOOTAGE ACTUALLY FOR GROWING FAMILIES WHO WILL IN TURN SELL THEIR HOMES AND. UPGRADE TO. SPACE IT'S MORE. APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR NEEDS. NOW THE ADDITIONAL HOME SALES WILL GENERATE CAPITAL GAINS BOTH BOTH SETS OF SELLERS WILL GENERATE CAPITAL GAINS. A PORTION OF WHICH WILL BE TAX AND INCREASED STATE REVENUES. BUT IN ADDITION THOSE TRANSACTIONS BOTH THE. THE H. FIFTY FIVE AND OLDER AND THE YOUNGER FAMILY MOVING UP. WILL GENERATE ADDITIONAL REVENUES IN THE FORM OF TRANSFER TAX. AND ALSO GENERATE INCREASED INCOME FOR PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY WHO'S INVOLVED IN THE REAL ESTATE MARKET. REALTORS OF COURSE BUT ALSO TITLE COMPANIES MOVERS. HOME INSPECTION SERVICES. HOME REMODELING. FIRMS ALL OF ALL OF THEM WILL HAVE MORE BUSINESS WILL REPORT MORE INCOME ON THEIR STATE INCOME TAX. OF FORMS AND PAY MORE INCOME TAXES TO THE STATE. AND THE ADDITIONAL INCOME WILL ALSO FIND ITS WAY INTO TAXABLE PURCHASES WHICH WILL GENERATE ADDITIONAL SALES AND USE TAXES. I SAID TWO FACTORS WILL GENERATE REVENUES IN ONE OF THEM HASN'T BEEN I DON'T THINK ADEQUATELY DISCUSSED IN AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO TURN TO RIGHT NOW. THE DOCTOR CAMPBELL AND I ARE CONVINCED THAT THE INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR SENIOR FRIENDLY HOUSING. NOT RESULTING FROM THIS INITIATIVE WILL SPUR SIGNIFICANT NEW CONSTRUCTION OF SUCH HOUSING. LOG IN RESPONSE TO THAT INCREASED DEMAND. OF THE INCREASE IN HOME BUILDING WILL. NOT PUT MORE PROPERTY ON THE PROPERTY TAX ROLLS AS. A BUILDINGS ARE PUT IN PLACE ON WHAT IS NOW TAXED AS WERE ALL LAND. OKAY IN ADDITION. TO THE HOME CONSTRUCTION PROCESS WILL GENERATE MORE INCOME FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. FOR BUILDERS TO CREATE MORE JOBS THAT WILL INCREASE TAXABLE INCOME AND ALSO TAXABLE SPENDING. IT WILL STIMULATE ADDITIONAL PURCHASES OF GOODS AND SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED TO EQUIP NEW HOMES. AND. THAT TOO WILL GENERATE ADDITIONAL SALES AND USE TAXES ARE REALLY. ALL OF THE PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF REVENUE TO THE STATE AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL BENEFIT. FROM THIS INITIATIVE. IN OUR OPINION THE ADDITIONAL REVENUES WILL OFFSET A SIGNIFICANT PORTION IF NOT ALL OF THE REVENUE LOSS RESULTING FROM EXTENDING THE BENEFITS OF PROPOSITION SIXTY. TWO ADDITIONAL SENIORS. IN FACT IF HOME BUILDERS. ARE. SUFFICIENTLY RESPONSIVE. TO THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR SENIOR FRIENDLY HOUSING AND HOME BUILDERS THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY DO THEY BUILD HOMES. IF THEY'RE SUFFICIENTLY RESPONSIVE. IT IS LIKELY THAT THIS MEASURE WILL PAY FOR ITSELF. NOW THERE'S ONE MORE FACT TO CONSIDERAND. LOOKING AT THE FISCAL THE FACT OF THE INITIATIVE. AND THAT'S THE REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE OF THE COUNTIES UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY. IS MR YOU'LL ARE EXPLAINED COUNTIES HAVE THE CHOICE UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY. TO ALLOW. CERTAIN INTER COUNTY MOVERS TO BRING THEIR OLD ASSESS VALUE WITH THEM TO THEIR NEW HOME. NOW IF THE TRANSFERS WERE SIGNIFICANT MONEY LOSERS WE WOULD NOT EXPECT THE COUNTIES TO AGREE THAT THIS. YET THE STATE'S SEVEN LARGEST COUNTIES AND PROBABLY THE MOST FINANCIALLY SOPHISTICATED COUNTIES. OKAY INTEND YOU TO ALLOW ENTRY INTO COUNTY MOVERS TO BRING THEIR OLD NAVY WITH THEM TO THEIR NEW HOME. AND SOME OF THEM MOST OF THEM HAVE BEEN DOING SO FOR THIRTY YEARS. WE THINK THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR OPINION THAT THE SPUR TO NEW HOME CONSTRUCTION. COMING FROM THE INITIATIVE WILL GENERATE DOES. YEAH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT WILL HELP HELP LOSS AT THOSE COST AND PERHAPS NOT COVER ALL OF THEM. I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. MISTER KARIM. THANK YOU I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS ON THE TIME ASSUMPTIONS THAT YOU MAKE CARE I GUESS IF IF YOU LOOK AT THESE TO THE PROPONENTS ARGUMENT AND THE OPPOSITION I THINK MOST OF US. ARE ON THE SAME SIDE WHAT TO ADDRESS THAT HOUSING CRISIS IN THE HOUSING SHORTAGE IN THE SUPPLY ISSUE AS WELL AS. CONTINUE TO RECEIVE. ADEQUATE MONIES FOR OUR. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SPECIFICALLY OUR SCHOOLS AND SO THAT THE CRUX OF THE DEBATE HERE IS. THE DON. THE DIFFERING OPINION YOU HAVE THAT ARE ALEJO. ITS IS ONE IF YOU COULD WALK THROUGH HOW YOU GET THERE A BIT MORE SO ESSENTIALLY IF I BOIL IT DOWN. THERE THEIR ARGUMENT IT'S THAT YOU DON'T SEE IS THEY TALK ABOUT THE WINDFALL THAT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THESE. INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE DOING THIS ANYWAY OKAY YEAH THIS THERE'S NO DISAGREEMENT ON THAT POINT AND THE THE REAL ISSUE FROM A FISCAL. EFFECTS STANDPOINT IS. WILLIE ADDITIONAL REVENUE THAT THE MANAGER GENERATES BE SUFFICIENT. TO OFFSET THAT BUILT IN LOSS THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED. THERE. ANYTIME YOU GIVE SOMEONE A BENEFIT. THAT THEY DID NOT REQUIRE IN ORDER TO ACTED NO WAY THEY DID. IT'S IT'S GOING TO HAVE THE EFFECT OF REDUCING PROPERTY TAX REVENUES. BUT THAT IN ITSELF IS NO DEBATE OVER THAT THE THE ISSUE IS WHETHER IT'S GOING TO SPUR ENOUGH NEW CONSTRUCTION. TO GENERATE REVENUE TO OFFSET THOSE LOSSES AND I THINK THERE ARE THREE REASONS WHY IT IS LIKELY THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT SPUR TO HOUSING CONSTRUCTION IN RESPONSE TO THIS INCREASE IN DEMAND. NUMBER ONE THE INCREASE IN DEMAND IS GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON A VERY PARTICULAR SEGMENT OF THE HOUSING MARKET. IT WERE SPREAD THROUGHOUT. THE HOUSING MARKET IN CALIFORNIA MIGHT NOT HAVE MUCH OF AN IMPACT. BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO BE IT'S GOING TO BE FOCUSED. MY NEXT SEGMENT OF THE MARKET THAT SERVES. SENIORS CONDOMINIUMS WITH ELEVATORS. TOWNHOUSES WITH ZERO LOT LINES. SENIOR COMMUNITIES LIKE ROSS MORE WHERE THERE'S NO UP CAPE UPKEEP FOR THE RESIDENTS. IT'S ALL DONE BY THE OF THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION. THE THE DEMAND THAT THIS INITIATIVE IS GOING TO SPUR IS GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON THIS SEGMENT AND AS A CONSEQUENCE I THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE MUCH MORE OF AN IMPACT. IN TERMS OF SPURRING CONSTRUCTION. CLINTON NUMBER TWO IT'S A KIND OF HOUSING PARTICULARLY CONDOMINIUMS. THAT IS VERY EFFICIENT AND HOW IT USES LAND SO IT'S ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND AS PLANNING COMMISSIONS AND CITY COUNCILS. BECOME MORE SENSITIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS. IT'STHE KIND OF OF HOUSING THAT THAT THAT MOST RESPONSIVE TO THOSE CONCERNS AND SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE EASIER FOR BUILDERS TO GET THOSE NEAR PLANS APPROVED. AND NUMBER THREE. THE. THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR THE NEW CONSTRUCTION SENIORS. OUR AS A DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP THAT IS THE GROUP THAT IS MOST WELCOME IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. THEY DON'T PUT A BURDEN ON THE SCHOOL SYSTEMS THEY DON'T CONTRIBUTE TO CONGESTION AT. EIGHT EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND AND FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING. AND MY WIFE WHO SPENT THE LAST THIRTY YEARS. IN. TRYING TO PROMOTE AFFORDABLE. HOUSING DEVELOPMENT. TELLS ME THAT THE REAL PROBLEM IS. GETTING LOCAL PLANNING COMMISSIONS AND AND AND CITIES TO AGREED TO SERVE BUILD FAMILY HOUSING. BUT SENIORS ARE ALMOST ALWAYS WELCOME SO I THINK THERE'S A VERY GOOD REASON THEIR NUMBER VERY GOOD REASONS TO EXPECT. THAT IN THIS CASE THERE IS GOING TO BE AN INCREASE IN IN CONSTRUCTION AND THAT'S GOING TO HAVE ALL OF THOSE BENEFITS THAT I MENTIONED. JUST A FOLLOW UP IF I IF I COULD AND CHECK. SO WHY WHY DO YOU THINK THE LA EL IS IS DISCOUNTING THAT THAT THE. ARGUMENTS YOU'RE PUSHING AS FAR AS THE IMPACT OF THAT CONSTRUCTION ON THIS NICHE. INDUSTRY AND THAT THAT THE NEXT SUB SEGMENT OF THIS INDUSTRY. WELL I HAVE THE UTMOST RESPECT AND ADMIRATION FOR THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE SPEAKING FOR THEM. I DID NOTE THAT MR YOU'LL ARE SAID HIS TESTIMONY TODAY WAS BASED ON THE PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE. THAT THEY MADE BACK IN SEPTEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AS PART OF THE TITLE AND SUMMARY PROCESS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEIR FINAL ESTIMATE IS GOING TO BE. I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY WILL LOOK MORE FAVORABLY ON THE ARGUMENTS THE ANALYSIS THAT MISTER DOCTOR CAMPBELL AND I HAVE HAVE. HAD HAVE DONE BUT I CAN'T AND I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THEM. BUT THE BUT BASIC POINT WE MAKE HERE IS THAT YOU CAN'T APPLY THE OVERALL CONSTRUCTION RATE TO THAT PARTICULAR TYPE OF OF HOUSING THE SMALLER. TYPE OF HOUSING THAT DOCTOR HIM JUST DESCRIBED. SO I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS. YOU MENTION THAT ONLY ELEVEN COUNTIES RIGHT NOW PARTICIPATE AND IT'S A VOLUNTEER PROGRAM WITHIN STATE LAW RAIN NOW MY QUESTION WOULD BE WHY ONLY ELEVEN PARTICIPATING NOW IF IT'S. SO USEFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE THE MY OTHER QUESTION IS ON. BASED ON EXPERIENCE I HAVE A MOTHER OF ADVANCED AGE I'M NOT GONNA GIVE HER IS HOME NOW SHE WOULD KILL ME. HOWEVER WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE LOAN PROCESS AND SO MY QUESTION ON WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CONSTRUCTION OF THESE THIS HOUSING FOR SENIORS IS. IN YOUR ESTIMATION ARE THESE HOMES IS ARE THESE TRANSFER HOMES MORE EXPENSIVE OR LESSER VALUE. AND IN MY EXPERIENCE. SOMETIMES BUYING A HOME AND AN ADVANCED AGE IS A CHALLENGE NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ON A LIMITED INCOME EVEN IF YOU HAVE SAVINGS AND YOU AT EQUITY FROM YOUR HOME. THAT SAVINGS DOESN'T ALWAYS OFFSET IN THE LENDING PROCESS THE FACT THAT YOU EITHER ARE JUST YOUR INCOME IS JUST RETIREMENT. OR. OR THAT YOU'RE AND OF ADVANCED AGE AND YOU'RE ASKING FOR A THIRD I'VE ACTUALLY HAD SOMEONE SAY TO ME BUT SHE'S. THIS AGENT IT'S A THIRTY YEAR LOAN SO HOW IN YOUR CALCULATION HAVE YOU TAKEN THAT AND THEN MY QUESTION ABOUT THE LEFT INCOMES. SO I I I THINK YOUR SECOND POINT IS A VERY ASTUTE OBSERVATION AND I AGREED THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE A PANACEA FOR ALL SENIORS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I THINK THAT AGAIN AND I'M I'M NOT MAKING THE CASE FOR AGAINST THE INITIATIVE BUT. IT IT CERTAINLY WILL. REMOVE SIGNIFICANT DETERRENT. TWO SENIOR IS FINDING MORE SUITABLE HOUSE SCENE BY ALLOWING THEM TO AT LEAST MAINTAIN THEIR CURRENT ASSESSED VALUE BASE. AND NOT HAVE TO SPEND MORE MONEY. FOR PROPERTY TAXES NOW THE REST OF THE ECONOMICS OF THE MOVE. MAY MAY NOT ALLOW THAT MOVED TO TAKE TAKE PLACE BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE IT WILL. WITH REGARD TO THE IRAQ QUESTION WITH REGARD TO THE PROP NINETY COUNTIES A I HONESTLY TO DO NOT UNDERSTAND. WHY THERE HAVEN'T BEEN MORE COUNTIES OF SIGNED UP BECAUSE THE SIZE OF THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE OPTED IN TO PROP NINETY? HAVE AS DOCTOR. HAVE DESCRIBED THEY'VE BEEN IN THE PROGRAM FOR FOR YEARS DECADES AND THEY HOLD ABOUT TWO THIRDS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT VENTURA ORANGE LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO SENATOR THESE ARE BIG COUNTIES. AND THEY CLEARLY HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THEY ARE LOSING MONEY. AND THAT'S SECOND THEY'VE CONTINUED TO STAY IN THE PROGRAM L. WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW BECAUSE IT'S AYE. ELEVEN COUNTIES IS NOT THAT MANY AND SO IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW THAT THOSE ARE LARGE COUNTIES I WONDER IF THERE'S AN ISSUE WITH MORE COUNTIES BUT THEY MIGHT. MISTER BLOOM. THANK YOU. A. YOU'RE SEATED AT THE TABLE. ARMED WITH THE PROPONENTS FOR THIS MEASURE NEW TWICE SAID THAT YOU'RE NOT HERE FOR AGAINST THE MEASURE BUT. I DON'T THINK YOU'D BE SEATED AT THIS TABLE IF SOMEBODY DIDN'T THINK THAT YOUR TESTIMONY WOULD BE FAVOR FAVORABLE TO THE. UP PROPONENTS OF THE MEASURE. BOB WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS I'M WE CURRENTLY HAVE A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS FOR MANY OF THESE TRANSFERS TO TAKE PLACE CORRECT YES SO WHY ARE YOU NOT RELYING ON STATISTICS. SHOWING THAT THERE'S INCREASED HOMEBUILDING TAKING PLACE AS A RESULT. OF THE CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND THEN EXTRAPOLATING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE. WE WE WE LOOK FOR THAT THAT KIND OF DATA AND ALL WEEK WE WE'RE IN CONTACT WITH THE CENTER FOR. RESEARCH ON THE REAL ESTATE MARKET AT UC BERKELEY. AND THE ONLY DATA THAT THEY COULD REFER US TO IS DATA ON. AGGREGATE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION STATEWIDE WHICH ISN'T RESPONSIVE. TO THE ISSUES THAT I THINK WE'RE FACING HERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A LIMITED SEGMENT OF THE MARKET. GIVE THAT KIND OF DATA WAS AVAILABLE ON THE IMPACT OF THE PROPS SIXTY PROGRAM YOU'RE RIGHT WE WOULD JUST EXTRAPOLATE THAT BUT THAT DATA JUST ISN'T AVAILABLE SO THE DATA DATA IS NOT AVAILABLE. AND YET YOU'RE ABLE TO. DO WHAT YOU KNOW MIKE MY COLLEAGUEFROM BIG BEAR WAS I'M SUGGESTING THAT TO MISTER HEWLETT WAS KIND OF GUESSING. AS TO WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ME THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE IS ANY BETTER THAN THE GAS EITHER. YOUR. YOUR YOUR CONCLUSION IS BASED ON OUGHT IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY ON THE THREE POINTS THAT YOU MADE THAT. THERE'LL BE INCREASED DEMAND. BECAUSE SENIORS ARE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE SOMEWHERE TO GO IN THERE FOR THIS MARKET IS SOMEHOW GOING TO MATERIALIZE FOR THEM. AND IN SUPPORT OF THAT YOUR POINTS TWO AND THREE ARE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE EASIER TO APPROVE BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE SENIORS BETTER. AND SENIORS ARE MORE ACCEPTABLE TO COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THEY DON'T DRIVE. I HAD I BEEN IN THIS CATEGORY FOR TEN YEARS I'M STILL DRIVING AND I EXPECT THAT I WILL BE FOR AWHILE. AND WHEN I STOPPED DRIVING. I'LL PROBABLY IF YOU KNOW THAT SHOULD HAPPEN AT SOME POINT I WILL PROBABLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A. TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANY IN NEW PARA LIFT TO GET ME AROUND THAT DOESN'T REDUCE CAR TRIPS SO I YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY WHO SERVED IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR FOURTEEN YEARS. THE DYNAMICS OF HOW DEVELOPMENT. GETS BUILT OR DOESN'T GET BELT. I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THIS BALLOT MEASURE. IF I MIGHT ADD. BECAUSE THIS UNDER PROP SIXTY PROP NINETY IS A ONE TIME BENEFIT PEOPLE HAVE TO ELECT TO USE THAT AND WE FOUND THAT. THERE'S. A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PROP SIXTY PROP NINETY INTO A LOT OF SENIORS DON'T USE THAT AS A RESULT IT ONLY MAKES UP ABOUT TWO PERCENT OF ALL TRANSACTIONS. SO WOULD BE DIFFICULT GIVEN THE LOW UTILIZATION RATE TO DRAW. CONCLUSIONS BASED ON ITS EXISTING YEARS. THANK YOU. AND OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ASSERTING. DESPITE BACK MISTER HAM ó WHAT ARE YOUR SUPPOSITIONS IN TERMS OF REVENUE GROWTH WAS. A SPUR OF NEW CONSTRUCTION DEVELOPMENT DID YOU. ESTIMATE WHERE THIS NEW CONSTRUCTION WAS GOING TO OCCUR. AND IT'S GOING TO OCCUR IN THAT SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT MORE LIKELY. NOT IN THE HIGHEST. PRICED REAL ESTATE ON THE COAST. MORE LIKELY. FURTHER INLAND. BUT NO WE DIDN'T DUH WE DIDN'T DO A GEOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF WHERE IT'S LIKELY TO BE BUILT. WELL I GUESS JUST LOOKING AT THAT. TEN COUNTY THAT ALREADY. ALLOW THE PROP NINETY TRANSFERRED THAT'S. POPULATION WISE I'M JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD. ON LOOKS LIKE HALF THE POPULATION OF THE STATE'S READY COVERED BY. THESE COUNTIES AND IN LARGE PART MOST OF ALMOST ALL OF. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THERE THERE WOULD BE. IT COULD BE ARE DID I DO ALREADY. I'M SUPPOSING THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE ONLY DEVELOPMENT IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THEY ALREADY CAN DO THESE. TRANSFER IS WHAT YOU'RE SAN BERNARDINO RIVERSIDE ORANGE SAN DIEGO LA VENTURA ALL OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CAN DO IT. NOW IT'S. THAT THE FEATURE OF THE INITIATIVE THAT'S GOING TO BE MOST RELEVANT TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS A FEATURE THAT WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO PAY MORE FOR THEIR NEW HOME THAN THE PRICE AT WHICH THEY SOLD THEIR OLD HOME. AND STILL GET THE BENEFITS AND SO THAT WILL BE VERY RELEVANT TO THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. BUT YOUR YOUR GAS ABOUT THEOREM THERE DID THE IMPORTANCE OF THE OF THE ELEVEN COUNTIES WAS RIGHT ON ITS FIFTY SIX PERCENT OF THE STATE'S POPULATION AREAS ARE IN THOSE COUNTIES RIGHT SO JUST NOT CLEAR TO ME WHERE THIS CONSTRUCTION BOOM WOULD. TAKE PLACE AND HOW THEY WOULD BE BENEFITS I WAS GONNA ASK. INTO MISTER CARLYLE'S POINT HUNDRED REPRESENTING EGGMAN YOU'RE BEING THE COUNTY ASSESSOR FROM WHEN THE COUNTY SAID DIDN'T. HAS NOT OP I MEAN. YOU GOT TO THINK OF SAN FRANCISCO OPTING A MARKET THAT IS ON. ON AFFORDABLE THEY WOULD JUST MAKE IT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ON AFFORDABLE THAT'S WHEN THE REASONS WE HAVE AN AMERICAN EVEN TELL YOU. HOW MANY PHONE CALLS I PICKED UP FROM SENIORS WHO WANTED TO MOVE? INTO SAN FRANCISCO AND ARMY IT WOULD CONTINUE TO PRICE OUT ALL THE FAMILIES AND. AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST TRYING TO. HANG ON TO. WE DON'T GET THEIR LITTLE TOENAIL INTO THE. TO THE HOUSING MARKETS TO JUST I GUESS BASED ON YOUR. ECONOMIC I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE THE REVENUES COMING FROM IN TERMS OF NEW CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE. IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY OCCURRING. IN ON INLAND CALIFORNIA MEETING IN SAMBOR MEDINA MEANING IF SOMEONE FROM LA CAN ALREADY GO TO SAN BERNADINE OUT WHY ISN'T THIS BUILDING BOOM ALREADY OCCURRING BECAUSE IF I'M. LIVING IN WEST LA AND I CAN GO OUT TO ON. YOUR SABATINO WERE PALM SPRINGS ARE SO SOMEWHERE ELSE OR ORDER SANTEE WHY WHY AM I NOT DOING THAT ALREADY LITTLE FOR FIRST OF ALL I I WOULD NOT SUBMIT THAT IT IS NOT OCCURRING. THERE ARE STILL HOMES BEING BUILT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND I THINK A LOT OF THAT IS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION MAY BE AND RESPONSE TO THESE AND TRIP INTERCOUNTY MOVES BUT THE SAYING THAT IT WILL CAUSE MORE INTER COUNTY MOVES. AND WILL BE OF BENEFIT TO THE HOUSING MARKETS IN SOUTHERN IS TO FEATURE THAT DOESN'T RESTRICTED. TO THOSE WHOSE. NEW HOME COSTS. MORE THAN THEIR OLD HOME. THAT'S THAT'S WHERE THE ADDITIONAL DEMAND WILL COME. BUT DID HE BUT EVEN GIVEN THAT RESTRICTION YOU DON'T HAVE ANY DATA CURRENTLY. SUPPORTING YOUR SOME SHARE AROUND NEW CONSTRUCTION MEANING YOU DON'T HAVE. DATA DOES DEMONSTRATING IF I'M LIVING ON THE WHOLE YA I'M MOVING INLAND BECAUSE OF THIS CONSTRUCTION. NO I I THINK LET ME IF I MAY RESPOND TO THAT. SO THERE'S ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY OF THOUSAND TRANSACTIONS ANNUALLY AND IT'S BEEN ESTIMATED THAT THIS WOULD RESULT IN FORTY THREE THOUSAND ADDITIONAL TRANSACTIONS ABOUT A TEN PERCENT INCREASE. SO THAT'S ABOUT A TEN PERCENT INCREASE IN TRANSACTIONS AND YET BELIAU SAYING NO NEW ADDITIONAL HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. WHITTAKER AND AND WE WE JUST SOMETHING THAT THAT MAKES ANY SENSE WE THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THE OVERALL IF YOU'RE BUILDING A SINGLE FAMILY HOME. THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. BUT FOR EXAMPLE IN SAN FRANCISCO IF YOU'RE BUILDING SMALLER HOMES THEN YOU KNOW THAT AND WHICH ARE LESS EXPENSIVE TO BUILD THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF HOMES THAT WILL BE BUILT. SO SAYING HOW MANY TRANSACTIONS OCCURRING NOW. DUH LA OWES ESTIMATED THAT WOULD BE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ADDITIONAL TRANSACTIONS WE SET NO IN REALITY HOW ME ART HOW ABOUT FORTY OF FOREIGN THIRTY THOUSAND A. MONTH ONE THREE THOUSAND FOOT AND OF THOSE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE MOVING TO. SENIOR HOMES IN OTHER NEIGHBORING COUNTIES. AND SPURRING THIS NEW CONSTRUCTION AYE I DON'T HAVE THAT THAT KIND OF AND THAT'S A CENTRAL ASSUMPTION OF MS RIGHT HEMIS RESEARCH. BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT TYPE OF DATA RIGHT NOW BECAUSE THEY'RE ABILITY TO MOVE TO OTHER COUNTIES AS RESTRICTIVE THAT'S THAT'S NOT TRUE I MEAN IF I'M IN SAN DIEGO I CAN GO TO SAN BERNARDINO. YEAH BUT THERE ARE FINE NOW AND I CAN GO TO FORTY SEVEN OTHER COUNTIES YOU CAN'T GO TO IF WE WEAK WEAKEN IPAD AS OR. YOU KNOW AND AND YOU KNOW BEING BEING OF REFORM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S NORTHERN CALIFORNIA'S DON'T LOVE GOING TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS NOT A VERY MUCH. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO MOVE INLAND RIGHT THIS THAT I MEAN THE SUPPOSITION IS. IS AGAIN IF I'M IN SAN DIEGO THERE'S A LOT OF REASON FOR ME IN TERMS OF DOWNSIZING TO MOOD CAN I DON'T KNOW SELECT ONE OF LEAVE FOR ME SAID IF YOU GOT THE BEST WEATHER IN THE REGION. WHAT WHY WHEN SHE JUST MOVED FURTHER INLAND WHERE WORST THAT I I GUESS I DON'T HEAR ANY DATA? BACKING UP YOUR ASSUMPTION AROUND THIS CONSTRUCTION BOOM THAT'LL GENERATE ANY REVENUE AND THAT'S MY CONCERN GIVEN THE POTENTIAL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT SCHOOLS BUT LOOSE AND AND YOU HAVE ENOUGH. DATA YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO SAY OF THE FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND THAT ARE YOU KNOW OTHER TOUCH OUR FORT FORTY THREE THOUSAND YOU SET FOR YOURSELF FORTY TWO THAT UP THE FORTY THREE THOUSAND. WHERE THEY MOVING TO BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO SUBMIT TO YOU WHERE THEY'RE GOING? IN ARE THEY GOING TO SENIOR HOUSING ARE THEY GOING TO THESE CONDOS ARE THEY GOING TO THESE ROSS MORSE ARE THERE. BUT LET MILLION GERMANS WE KNOW YOU HAVE THAT FORM YOU HAVE TO SUBMIT A FORM OF WHERE THEY'RE GOING BUT WE WE HAVE DATA WE WE CAN ESTIMATE HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE MOVING ACROSS COUNTY LINES AND TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROPOSITION SIXTY BENEFIT I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION HERE. BUT THE SURVEY DATA WILL ALLOW YOU HAVE THIS WILL OF THE FORTY THREE THOUSAND LETTER WRITER WOMAN IF I MAY WE SEEM TO BE HAVING A BACK AND FORTH KIND OF THING GOING ON HERE AND I CERTAINLY. HE'S ANSWERING SOME ARE ASKING SOME GREAT QUESTIONS BUT I JUST. WANNA MAKE SURE WE ARE RESPECTING THE DECORUM OF THE COMMITTEE. WELL I'M JUST TRYING TO GET AT THE CENTRAL REVENUE QUESTION AND AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THERE'S THERE'S ACTUAL ACTUAL DATA AS OF TODAY. AND WE KNOW THESE FORTY THREE S. IN ORDER FOR THESE FORTY THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE TO GET A TRANSFER THEY HAVE TO TELL YOU WHERE THEY'RE LEAVING AND WHERE YOU'RE GOING SO WE KNOW THAT. THE THIS IS SO I'M JUST ASKING THE PROPONENTS. WHETHER GOING ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS POINT OUT THAT THERE IS. INCONSISTENCY WITH REGARD TO THE LA THOSE. ANALYSIS IN WHICH THEY'RE SAYING THERE'S THAT THEY'LL BE THIS INCREASING DEMAND BUT NO INCREASE NO. HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. WONDERSTRUCK UNDERSTAND YOUR. ANALYSIS THAT YOU PAID FOR ARM. THE ANALYSIS OF THE FORTY THREE THOUSAND AND THIS ASSUMPTION AROUND THE REVENUE GROWTH AND. WHERE THAT'S COMING FROM BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY? YOU YOU I ASSUME MISTER MISTER HAMM DOCTOR CAMPBELL SAW OF THESE FORTY THREE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. EXTEMPORE WENT INTO THESE SENIOR HOMES WHICH WOULD. HOW THIS PIECE IN A PRECEPTOR SUPPOSITION THAT HEY? IF IF THIS WENT UP IF THIS NUMBER WENT UP TO LET'S SAY A HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT THIS WOULD SPUR. A EXPERT AND DEVELOPMENT WHICH IT WOULD IF IN FACT THOSE FORTY THREE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WERE GOING TO THESE TYPES OF PROPERTIES. SURVIVAL THINKS. SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER TING IT'S IS SO CO CHAIR OF THE JOINT OF A JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING. SO IT CHAIR. SO THE QUESTION IS FINE HOWEVER I BELIEVE THAT THE DATA IS JUST NOT AYE. AYE AS SO FAR WHAT WE'VE GATHERED IS THAT THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT DATA ON SEVERAL POINTS OUT OF THIS CONVERSATION AND WHETHER YOUR OPPONENT ARE. NOT IF YOU'RE PROPONENT FOR OPEN UP. THE DATA IS LACKING HOWEVER WITHOUT I BELIEVE. AS A MEMBER MURATSUCHI HAS A QUESTION. YES COMMENT THANK YOU SO. THAT THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCE AS YOU HIGHLIGHTED BETWEEN THE CURRENT LAW AND THE PROPOSED INITIATIVE IS THAT IT WOULD ALLOW. PEOPLE TO CARRY THEIR. PROP THIRTEEN. ASSESSMENT TO THEIR NEW PROPERTY IF IT'S GRAY OF GREATER VALUE THAN THEIR CURRENT HOME IS THAT CORRECT RIGHT BESIDE RIGHT NOW UNDER PROP SIXTY PROP NINETY S. B. EQUAL LESSON. SO IF YOU PURCHASE A MORE EXPENSIVE HOME EAT EVEN IF THE DOLLAR OVER YOU CAN'T MAKE THE TRANSFER SO IS THERE DATA SHOWING THAT THESE. THESE. THAT THESE NEW DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE TO BE SPURRED TO BE A BILL TO SENIOR HOMES CONDOMINIUMS ARE GOING TO BE OF GREATER. ON. AVERAGE ARE GOING TO BE OF GREATER VALUE THAN THE HOMES THAT ARE GOING TO BE SOLD. BECAUSE THAT'S THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THIS INITIATIVE RIGHT RIGHT WE'VE DONE US SOME STUDIES WHERE EVEN WHEN SOMEBODY'S DOWNSIZING ALBEIT TO IN YOUR HOME. KNOW TIME MARCHES ON IT YOU CAN JUST COST MORE AND AND NOT SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW MORE BUT ENOUGH SO THAT IT PREVENTS. THEM FROM DOING A TRANSFER. BUT ISN'T IT MORE LIKELY THAT IT WOULD BE THIS INITIATIVE WOULD BE USED BY PEOPLE WHO WOULD WANT TO. BUY A NICER. MORE EXPENSIVE HOME WHO OUT AND RATHER THAN NOT NECESSARILY THAT I DON'T THINK AGAIN THIS GOES BACK TO MS BROOKS POINT THESE ARE CHIU WERE WE WOULD BE GUESSING AS TO FOCUS MOTIVATIONS. THE POINT WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE ON THIS THOUGH IS IF THEY DO PURCHASE A MORE EXPENSIVE HOME THE GONNA HAVE TO PAY PROPERTY TAXES ON THAT MORE EXPENSIVE HOMES. YEAH I I JUST DON'T SEE. IT IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE SENSE TO ME THAT IF THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY THE INITIATIVE. IS FOR PEOPLE TO BUY A MORE EXPENSIVE HOME BUT NO THAT'S NOT THE PRIMARY REASON IT'S JUST I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THAT IS A TECHNICAL ERROR. THAT WAS MADE BY THE RITUAL DRAFTERS. BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IF THERE'S YOU CAN HAVE UP TO A TWO YEAR GAP. BETWEEN SELLING YOUR HOME AND PURCHASING YOUR HOME AND THERE'S A FIVE PERCENT INFLATION FACTOR PER YEAR. SO YOU CAN INFLATE THAT WHAT YOU SOLD YOUR HOME FOR TO RECALCULATE WHICH YOU CAN BUY FOR. THAT'S THE RARE CASE WHERE SOMEBODY CELLS AND THEN WAITS TWO YEARS AND BUYS THE MORE. YOU KNOW THE USUAL SITUATIONS WHERE YOU BUY AND SELL SIMULTANEOUSLY BUT IF YOU DO THAT EVEN IF YOU'RE A DOLLAR OVER YOU CAN'T DO THE TRANSFER BUT YOU ADMITTED EARLIER WE START OFF SAYING THAT. THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CURRENT LAW AND THE PROPOSED INITIATIVE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE BUYING MORE SEEKING TO BUY MARKS AND OF THAT WAS DOCTOR HANS POINT THAT THAT'S WHERE THE. REVENUE WILL CALM BECAUSE RIGHT NOW ALL THESE ALL THOSE FOLKS ARE ARE ARE LOCKED DOWN OF BEING ABLE TO DO A TRANSFER. WITH THIS CHANGE WHICH FORCES THEM OR REQUIRES THEM TO PAY ON ANY INCREASE YOU KNOW ALLOW THEM TO MAKE THAT TRANSFER. THANK YOU WE WILL HAVE THE UP WHAT I QUESTION ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CAN WILL HAVE THE OPPONENTS COME UP. DOROTHY JOHNSON TERRY BRENNAN MICHAEL MCLAUGHLIN. THINK KILL. WHOEVER WANTS TO PICK IT UP OF ALL START OUT THE MORE TIME FOR THE CHIEF. pMADAM CHAIR AND. MEMBERS TERRY BRENNAN BEHALF SERVICE IN PLACE INTERNATIONAL UNION WE'VE HAD A VERY SPIRITED DISCUSSION DAY SO I DON'T ONE. I'LL BE VERY BRIEF AND HIT A FEW POINTS ARE MADE APPRECIATED DE. SORT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE A DR HAMS ANALYSIS AND THE LA OPEN HOUSE. ONE DESCRIBED IS MORE STATIC IN ONENESS THAT DYNAMIC. I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT NGUYEN. THE LA O. TALKS ABOUT THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF OFFSETTING REVENUE. TO THE BILLION DOLLAR LOSS SCHOOLS LOCAL AGENCY SPECIAL DISTRICTS CITIES COUNTIES. THE OFFSETS ARE STATIC. THESE TRANSFER FEES AND COUNTY TAX FEES ARE ONE TYING. FEES AS OPPOSED TO ONGOING LOSSES EVERY YEAR IN PROPERTY TAX CONTRIBUTIONS. SO EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE GONNA OFFSET SLIGHTLY THE DISAPPEAR. THE ONLY DYNAMIC REVENUE OFFSET WAS INCREASED. VALUES OF THE HOMES. THERE WAS THE TALK ABOUT DRIVING IT UP POTENTIALLY SEVEN PERCENT BECAUSE THEY'RE ABLE TO USE THE PROPERTY TAX SAVINGS. TO PAY MORE FOR NEW HOMES. I DON'T THINK THAT'S IN OUR INTEREST WHEN WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS. TWO SAME WERE DRIVING THE COST OF HOMES UP BECAUSE THEY'RE MORE AVAILABLE TO THE SENIORS. THE SPECIAL CLASS WE'VE A CREED THAT CAN I PURCHASE A UPSCALE HOMES. HAVING SAID THAT I GUESS THE THE LAST CONCERN IS ABOUT WINNERS AND LOSERS. IT'S CLEAR THEY'RE GOING TO BE COMMUNITIES TO GAIN UNDER THE SINK COMMUNITY STEP SUFFER UNDER THIS IT'S A CLOSED SYSTEM. THERE WERE ONE THING WE DO NOW. THERE ARE LOSERS. OUR SCHOOLS. OUR LOCAL AGENCIES OUR FIRE DISTRICTS. ARE GOING TO LOSE AT LEAST A BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE. THE STATE. OF CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE UP ABOUT HALF OF THAT PAID BACK FILLING THE SCHOOL REVENUES. IT WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT BASIC A DISTRICTS AND PEOPLE COMING AYE I SHOULD TAKE PEOPLE. COMMUNITIES COMING ON AND OFF BASIC QUE DAYTON AND THE COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO THAT. AND THEIR WINNERS. THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY. ARE THERE GOING TO WIN HERE. ATTY EXPENSE OUR SCHOOLS OUR CITIES AND OUR COUNTIES. A FOR THAT REASON WE REMAIN OPPOSED TO THE INITIATIVE THANK YOU. FIRST NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR THAT MY NAME IS MIKE MCLAUGHLIN AND THE FIRE CHIEF WITH CONSUMERS COMMUNITY SERVICES DISTRICT FIRE DEPARTMENT WERE NOTONOMUS SPECIAL DISTRICT. PROVIDING PARKS AND RECREATION AND FIRE PROTECTION SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITIES NOW GROVER GOLF HERE IN SOUTHERN SACRAMENTO COUNTY. TERMS TO MY HONOR THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK WITH YOU REGARDING THIS. THIS IS CONCERNING FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS SOME OF WHICH WAS SPOKEN BY THE OPPONENTS A PROPONENTS OF. OF OF THIS INITIATIVE I'M JUST A BIT EARLIER. THUMB BE I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT UP PROPOSITION THIRTEEN AND PROPOSITION NADER WORKING THE WAY THEY'RE DESIGNED IT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE RELIEF AS AS OUR MARKET CHANGES YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT. I REMEMBER GROWING UP IN THE FIRE SERVICE AND KNOWING THAT BEING A PART OF A SPECIAL DECK STRICTEST WHERE YOU WANTED TO BE BECAUSE THE REVENUES ARE SO MUCH STATE MORE STABLE. FROM PROPERTY TAXES THERE'S LESS AFFECTED BY LONG TERM FLUXES INFLUXES OF A OF THE ECONOMY THEM AS WE'RE FINDING OURSELVES IN THE POST RECESSION STAGE. THAT AS OUR DISTRICT WE DID NOT SEE A DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY AND AND OUR PROPERTY TAX REVENUE UNTIL THE NATION WAS SEEING AN UPTICK COMING OUT OF THE BOTTOMS OF THE DEPTH THE RECESSION JUST BECAUSE PROPERTY TAX TAKES. TWO TO THREE YEARS BEFORE IT ACTUALLY ENDS UP HITTING THE LOCAL TAX ROLLS A LOCAL THE LOCAL DOLLARS SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A LAG IMAGE IN BEHIND IN THAT REGARD. BUT AS WE FIND OURSELVES TODAY. SEVERAL YEARS POST RECESSION THAT OTHERS REMAIN SIX POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF UNDERSIZED VALUATION IN THE STATE IN THE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY ALONE SO. THAT'S A DIFFERENCE AND SO GOING INTO THE RECESSION THERE WERE SIX POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS MORE SASS VALUE THAN THERE IS NOW WITH THE PROPOSITION EIGHT VALUE. SOME OF THAT IS BECAUSE MANY OF THESE PROPERTY SOLD FOR LESSER AMOUNT DURING THE RECESSION SOME OF WHICH IS THE BAY HAVE NOT YET RETURNED TO THE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN VALUE TO PUT THEM BACK TO THAT PROPOSITION THIRTEEN PACE. SO AS A AS GOOD AS PARTNER I'M INITIATIVES THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE WITH PROPOSITION THIRTEEN AS A PROPERTY DROPS IT GIVES THE TAX ASSESSOR'S THE ABILITY TO LOWER THE TAX RATE. THAT SYSTEM AB BY A I SUBMIT TO YOU IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON IT SAID IT BIGGEST MUCH TO THE TO STRUGGLE WITH US AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHERE AS A SPECIAL DISTRICT. AND WE MAKE UP ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THEM OF OUR REVENUE BASED OFF OF PROPERTY TAX IT WOULD BE A BIT HIGHER BUT WHERE TRANSPORTING PARAMEDIC ENTITY. AND SO WERE ABLE TO RECOVER COSTS FOR PROVIDING AMBULANCE SERVICE TO THAT HOW TWO HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND RESIDENTS WITHIN OUR DISTRICT. HOME BUT WITH THAT. WITH PROPOSITION TWENTY SIX WERE ONLY ALLOWED TO DO A FEE FOR SERVICE AND RECOVER OUR COSTS WE CAN'T CHARGE MORE MAKE A PROFIT BECAUSE THEN THAT'S A TAX IN AND OF ITSELF. AND SO WE HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS ESPECIALLY IS A SPECIAL DISTRICT AND WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO US. I'M JUST KEEPING TO THE POINT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WAS INTERESTING. BUT IS IS IS IS THE UP UP UP PROPONENTS BROUGHT FORTH IT THERE WOULD BE POTENTIALLY SOME OFFSETTING REVENUE SUCHAS CAPITAL GAINS TAXES TRANSFER TAXES INCOME TAX AND SALES AND USE TAX. WELL I SUBMIT TO YOU THAT THE ONLY TAX OF MY DISTRICT IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC SAFETY IN OUR COMMUNITY IS PROPERTY TAX NONE OF THOSE OTHER TAXES. ROLL DOWN TO SPECIAL DISTRICTS OR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THAT REGARD AND SO THIS WOULD TRULY BE AN OFFSET MAYBE. AT THE END AND AND AS I THINK WE'VE LEARNED TODAY THAT THERE'S NO YOU KNOW THAT IT THERE SOME REALLY HEAR SOME GOOD WORK IT'S GOING INTO A BUT WE REALLY NEVER NEVER. WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS WILL LOOK LIKE ON THE END BUT WHAT I CAN SAY IS EVEN IF IT'S A NET ZERO SUM GAME AT THE END OF THE DAY IN THE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY TEAR THEM OUT OF TAX DOLLARS. BEING PAID MANY OF THOSE ARE SWITCHING FROM PROPERTY TAX INTO OTHER TYPES OF TAXES THAT WOULD NO LONGER BE AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TODAY. OF WITHOUT ME HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR DOROTHY JOHNSON OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES. I'LL ALSO KEEP MY REMARKS. BRIEF AND REALLY WANT RESPOND TO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED I'M DURING THE PROPONENTS TESTIMONY AND FIRST ONE TO START BY ECHOING THE CONCERN THAT MAYBE STATEWIDE THIS WHEN THAT OUT BUT REGION'S. AND COUNTY BY COUNTY ISSUES REMAIN AND THAT'S LARGELY BECAUSE OF THIS NEW EXPANSION OF THE PROP NINETY ALLOWANCE SO LINE ONE COUNTIES A TAX BILL TO MOVE TO ANOTHER. AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY TROUBLING AND WE DO HAVE ELEVEN COUNTIES CURRENTLY THEY'LL PROVIDE THE PROP NINETY PERMISSION. LARGELY A WEE WEE HOURS I'VE SPOKEN TO EARLIER THAT THESE ARE WEALTHY COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOT SEEN A PROBLEM. COVER EL DORADO COUNTY JUST LAST FALL BUT IT AND THEY'RE PROP NINETY PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY WERE SEEN HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN PROPERTY TAXES LOSS FOR THE COUNTY THE CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS SO. TO SAY THAT EVERY PROP NINETY COUNTY IS A HAPPY WEALTHY COUNTY WITH POSITIVE OUTCOMES. THAT'S SIMPLY NOT TRUE I ALSO WANT TO SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF A HOUSING BRIEFLY. DESPITE THE SORT OF. AT. THAT CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT WE WOULD HOPE COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN BEST CASE SCENARIO. THIS MEASURE WILL NOT BUILD A SINGLE ADDITIONAL UNIT IT WOULD NOT PROTECT A SINGLE A FOR A HOUSING UNIT. AND WOULD NOT HELP HOMEOWNERS OR SIMPLY PRICED OUT OF OF THE MARKET AND SO WE THINK TO SAY THAT THIS IS A. REMEDY OR A SOLUTION TO THE HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA IS SOMEWHAT DISINGENUOUS. AND THEN FINALLY THE IDEA OF THE PRETTY CLOSE ESTIMATES. THE THOUGHT THAT THERE COULD BE A REVENUE NEUTRAL OUTCOME. THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT ARE CRITICAL SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE SAFETY NET PROVIDERS ARE QUALITY OF LIFE PROVIDERS CAN YOU CAN BANK ON THAT'S NOT HOW COUNTY BUDGETS ARE MADE AND SO. THE RISK HERE WOULD NEVER FALL TO THE PROPONENTS OF IT FALLS SQUARELY ON THE SHOULDERS OF COUNTIES OF SPECIAL DISTRICTS OF CITIES. OF THE STATE FOR THOSE REVENUE LOSSES AND THAT IS FAR TOO BIG OF A. THAT'S SOMETHING. I'M ALRIGHT. WILL MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT THANK YOU. DANIELLE CAN A KAISER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION THE ASSOCIATION IS IN STRONG OPPOSITION. AND AFFILIATES OUR POSITION WITH THE COMMENTS OF THE OPPOSITION IN PARTICULAR WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PUBLIC SERVICES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AS WELL AS THE HARMFUL IMPACT WHEELS THIS WILL HAVE ON NON SENIOR HOMEBUYERS SUCH AS YOUNG FAMILIES MANY OF WHOM ALREADY STRUGGLE TO FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN TOTAL THE MEASURE PROVIDES LITTLE TO NO BENEFIT THE HOUSE TO THE HOUSING MARKET WHILE BENEFITING THOSE WHO HAVE ALREADY REAPED SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS. OF PROP THIRTEEN AS WELL AS THE PROPONENTS OF THE MEASURE THEMSELVES THANK YOU. HELLO. I MY NAME IS AARON STUMPF AND I'M A RESIDENT OF SACRAMENTO WHEN I'M A REALTOR. I HAVE BEEN FOR ABOUT THIRTEEN YEARS AND I A I CURRENTLY HOLD A BROKER'S LICENSE AND I'M ALSO A SENIORS REAL ESTATE SPECIALIST WHICH. THE S. RES DESIGNATION MEANS THAT I'VE. GONE THROUGH ADDITIONAL EDUCATION IN ORDER TO LEARN HOW TO HELP BUYERS AND SPECIFICALLY SENIOR BUYERS AND SELLERS TRANSACT BASED ON THEIR INDIVIDUAL REAL ESTATE NEEDS. AND EVERY WEEK I SPEAK WITH SELLERS WHO. NEED TO SELL A HOME THAT NO LONGER CURRENTLY MEETS THEIR NEEDS. THE HOME MIGHT BE TWO STORIES OF THE HOME MIGHT. NOT BE IN A STATE OF DISREPAIR. AND THE DESIRE TO MOVE CLOSER TO THEIR FAMILY. TO A HOME THAT SMALLER ON MAYBE SINGLE LEVEL OR THINGS LIKE THAT. THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT I HEAR FROM SENIOR CLIENTS. THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM SELLING THEIR HOME IS THE POTENTIAL FOR A SPIKE IN THEIR PROPERTY TAX BILL. I. IT'S IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM IT'S A REAL PROBLEM AND WE CALL THIS A MOVING PENALTY TYPICALLY IN REAL ESTATE. THE PROPERTY TAX FINISH INITIATIVE WOULD ALLOW SELLERS. WHO ARE SENIORS TO MOVE TO SMALLER HOMES? CLOSER TO FAMILY WITHOUT THE MOVING PENALTY THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. I'M I'M REALLY THANKFUL THAT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS HAS TAKEN THE INITIATIVE TO DO THIS WHERE A MEMBER DRIVEN ORGANIZATION ARM AND OUR MEMBERS ARE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS. BROUGHT THIS FORWARD TO TRY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WHERE SENIORS DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO EASILY MOVE A LOT OF THEM ARE ON FIXED INCOMES. A LOT OF THEM DON'T HAVE THE SAME ABILITY THAT YOUNGER COUNTERPARTS DO. AND SENIORS OFTEN REMAIN HOMES THAT. ARE DANGEROUS FOR THEM TO BE AND I HAVE CLIENTS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN IN THERE UP STAIRS OF THEIR TWO STORY HOME. IN YEARS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GO UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS ANYMORE. I HAVE CLIENTS WHO CAN'T. MAINTAIN THEIR YARDS ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE KIDS AROUND HELP THE MOBILE HONORED TO GARDENING OR THINGS LIKE THAT. AND THESE ARE HOMES THAT ARE. DANGEROUS POTENTIALLY THEY HAVE PLUMBING LEAKS THEY HAVE ROOF LEAKS. THE SENIORS CAN'T AFFORD TO FIX THEM. THIS WOULD BASICALLY HELP FIX A PATCHWORK OF REALLY INCONSISTENT. TAX PROPERTY TAX BASIS TRANSFER LAWS THAT WE HAVE AS YOU'VE HEARD IN OTHER TESTIMONY THERE ARE ONLY ELEVEN COUNTIES THAT CURRENTLY. RECEIVE. INCOMING PROPERTY TAX BASIS TRANSFERS. HERE IN SACRAMENTO IF I HAVE A CLIENT WHO WANTS TO MOVE NEAR THERE. UP FAMILY IN PLASTER COUNTY WHICH IS ONLY A HALF HOUR AWAY. THEY CAN'T TRANSFER THEIR PROPERTY TAX BASES WITH THEM THEY CAN'T MOVED TO BE CLOSER TO THEIR FAMILY. I IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM. I'M AND AGAIN LET'S NOT FORGET THE POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC STIMULUS STIMULUS. WHEN NEW OWNERS BY THESE HOMES THEY'RE GONNA SPEND MONEY ON HOME IMPROVEMENT. THEY'RE GONNA SPEND MONEY ON ENERGY EFFICIENT UPGRADES TO THEIR HOMES I'M THAT THE SENIORS JUST CAN'T CURRENTLY AFFORD TO DO THINK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME SET THREE THE THREE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS ON BEHALF OF P. COLLIER ASSOCIATES. REPRESENTING AMERICAN LEGION DEPARTMENT OF CALIFORNIA AMERICAN GI FORM OF CALIFORNIA AND VETS DEPARTMENT OF CALIFORNIA. MILITARY OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA CALIFORNIA COUNCIL OF. CHAPTERS ASSOCIATION OF UNITED STATES ARMY OF CALIFORNIA SCOTTISH AMERICAN MILITARY SOCIETY CALIFORNIA. MILITARY ORDER OF THE PURPLE HEART. THE CALIFORNIA HOME SUPPORT OF THIS INITIATIVE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR ROB GROWS CLOSER WITH THE AND COUNTY ASSESSORS ASSOCIATION. WE DON'T A POSITION ON THE INITIATIVE ONE OF THE VERY CLEAR THERE AS ADMINISTRATORS WOULD WANT TO SPEAK TO THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS BUT WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT FOR THE COMMITTEE AND THOSE OF YOU HERE TODAY. THAT. CURRENTLY IN THE EXISTING SYSTEM GOES FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY BEING THAT THREATENS. THEIR THIS INITIATIVE HE COOK COUNTY A COUNTY BE KINDA SEE COUNTY DE AND THE NUMBERS MOVING UP AND DOWN WITH THIS SORT OF OUR UNLIMITED TRANSFER THERE. SO WE WOULD BE RELYING ON. THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION IS SORT OF BECOMING A CLEARINGHOUSE FOR THIS INFORMATION. AND I KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO THE COST OF THIS THERE IS A HARD COST WE CAN EASILY ESTIMATES. I THINK WAS TWENTY SIXTEEN THERE ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND OR SO IT'S PROP SIXTEEN NINETY ONE TEN TRANSFERS THAT OCCURRED STATEWIDE WE AS ALEJO POINTS OUT CAN BE TENS OF THAT TIME TENS OF THOUSANDS. EACH ONE OF THOSE WAS ROUGH ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY TO TWO AT ALL HOURS IN STAFF COSTS AT THE SENSORS LEVEL. SUCH AS LITTLE STARTED ON THE COST SIDE FOR THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M TRACY CEZANNE AND I'VE BEEN A LICENSED REAL FOR REALTOR FOR THIRTY EIGHT YEARS I'M ALSO THAT PROPERTY TAX ISSUES CHAIR FOR CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. A LOT OF THESE POINTS I ECHO AYE SPEAKING FAVOR OBVIOUSLY AT THE INITIATIVE. I WANNA TELL YOU THOUGH THAT I TAKE THIS VERY PERSONALLY BECAUSE I HAVE FAMILY THAT. A HAD THEIR HOME BURNED DOWN IN THE NAPA FIRES. AND A THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO MOVE IN WITH ANYBODY WITHIN THE SAME COUNTY THEY DO HAVE FAMILY IN SAN DIEGO. BUT THEY COULDN'T. MOVE THEIR PROPERTY TAX BASE TO SAN DIEGO. THEY ENDED UP THESE THIS WAS SENIOR. RELATIVES IN THEIR EIGHTIES AND NINETIES. AND ENDED UP HAVING TO MOVE INTO A SENIOR LIVING WHICH IS COSTING THEM NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS A PIECE EVERY MONTH. I ALSO HAVE A CLIENT THAT IS VERY SEVERELY DISABLED I'M SHE NEEDS TO HAVE A MACHINE TO TALK. SHE'S A WHEELCHAIR BOUND. AND SHE WOULD LIKE VERY MUCH TO MOVE INTO THE COUNTY WHERE HER FAMILY CAN HELP TAKE CARE OF HER. AND RIGHT NOW SHE'S UNABLE TO DO THAT AND SO SHE PAYS. FOR ONGOING IN HOME CARE WHICH IS COSTING THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A MONTH. I SPEAK SPEAK AGAIN IN FAVOR OF THIS INITIATIVE AND OF LIKE YOU TO TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION WE ALSO WILL. SORELY NEED WE SORELY NEED TO BUILD THE INVENTORY SO THAT MORE PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO BUY HOMES. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SAID DOUG HOLLAND WITH THE. BUT I'M POLICY DIRECTOR FOR SACRAMENTO TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS INITIATIVE. THERE LOT NUMBERS HAVE BEEN FLYING AROUND HERE TODAY IN A NUMBER OF ISSUES RELATIVE TO GOVERNMENT REVENUE. BUT I DON'T WANT THE COMMITTEE OR THE MEMBERS TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE FACT AS WE'VE PROBABLY HEARD AS WELL. THAT THERE ARE REAL STORIES BEHIND THE NEED FOR THIS TYPE OF INITIATIVE. SENATOR GAINES ON THE SENATE SIDE HAS A BILL TO ALLOW A VETERANS TO TAKE THEIR PROPERTY TAX VALUES WITH THEM WHEN THEY MOVE. YOU HAVE SENIOR CITIZENS AND THE AYE AYE KIND HAD TO CHUCKLE. LISTENING TO THE LA OUT TALK ABOUT AND IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS JUST KIND OF A ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION DISCUSSION. IN THE ANALYSIS. AND ON MY GOODNESS THE SKIES GOING FALL IN BECAUSE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TECHNICALLY YOU'RE TALKING IN LARGE PART ABOUT A GROUP OF PEOPLE. AND ALL THE DIFFERENCE TO MISTER POPE. WHO MAY ONLY MOVE ONCE OR TWICE IT'S NOT GOING TO BE DOMINOS I DON'T SEE MY EIGHTY FIVE YEAR OLD MOTHER SAYING I'M GOING TO MOVE TO SANTEE? AND THEN MAYBE TO SAN FRANCISCO AND THEN MAYBE TO CRESCENT CITY. IN THE SPAN OF THE NEXT DECADE. SO THESE ARE REAL ISSUES THAT FACE PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT CHOICES IN THEIR LIFE. IN ORDER TO BE CLOSER TO FAMILY CLOSER TO MEDICAL FACILITIES THAT THEY NEED. AND DON'T FORGET THE FACES THAT ARE ATTACHED TO THESE EQUATIONS IT'S MORE THAN JUST A TRANSFER TAX. OR LOSS OF REVENUE TO PARTICULAR GOVERNMENT ENTITY THESE PEOPLE THAT MAKE THESE CHOICES IN REAL TIME. AN ANY BREAK THAT WE CAN GIVE THEM I THINK THEIR WELL DESERVED THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ANTHONY TOWN HELL WITH CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS SUSHI XIN WE REPRESENT THOUSANDS OF. SPECIAL DISTRICTS. ACROSS THE STATE THE PROVIDE ALL MANNER OF ESSENTIAL LOCAL SERVICES. THE SAME AMENITIES AND QUALITY FROM ONE SERVICES. THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO PLACE A CLIENT TO. WHEN THEY'RE RELOCATING TO A NEW COMMUNITY INTO HOME. I WON'T BELABOR IT AS ONE OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. MEMBERS THE FIRE CHIEF SPOKE REALLY VERY ELOQUENT TO IT. BUT OUR BORDERS TAKEN A. UP. ONCE MEASURE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. GOOD AFTERNOON. MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS LINDA WOULD I AM A REAL ESTATE AYE. BROKER AND I HAVE BEEN FOR ABOUT TWENTY SIX YEARS I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. I WOULD ONE THING I REALLY DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT I DON'T THINK WE HEARD SO MUCH IS THAT EVERY TIME SOMEBODY. COMES IN AND BUYS THAT HOUSE AT THAT SENIOR IS MOVING OUT OF THAT IS CREATING A HOME THE SOMEBODY IS GOING TO BE PAINFUL PROPERTY TAX ON. MOST LIKELY NOT ANOTHER SENIOR YOU HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO COME FROM. THE BAY AREA AND EXPENSIVE AREAS IN SAN FRANCISCO THEY'RE GONNA COME AND BUY A ONE TO BE CLOSER TO THEIR KIDS OR GO TO A LESS. EXPENSIVE AREA THAT'S GOING TO OPEN UP HOMES IN DIFFERENT PLACES I WILL JUST AS AN EXAMPLE USE MANY OF MY CLIENTS I READ THEY ARE GOING TO BE MOVING FROM ONE HOME AND I'M GONNA JUST SAY AS AN EXAMPLE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND. THEY'RE GOING TO BUY ANOTHER HOME AND MAYBE THEY'RE GONNA MOVE TO A SENIOR COMMUNITY AND A SIMILAR HOME THIS PUBLIC IN ACOSTA ME BEFORE INNER FIFTY THOUSAND IF WE HAD THIS SITUATION. THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT PAY THE DIFFERENCE ON THAT AND STILL MAINTAIN THEIR TAX YOU WOULD NOT LOSE THEIR TAX BASE THAT THEY WERE PAYING ON THEIR POWER ON THEIR HOMES THEIR MOVING FROM. THERE WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT YOU'D HAVE A NEW BUYER COMING IN AND PAYING A MUCH HIGHER TAX RATE ON THAT HOME THAT'S THERE. I JUST WE DO SEE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE DO NEED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE OUT OF THAT HOME THAT THEY CAN NO LONGER CARE FOR. OR THEY. HAVE THE JUST A LITTLE STEP DOWN THEY'RE GONNA SLIPS AND FALLS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO I JUST REALLY SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DENISE TRUSTS FRANK I'M AND I HAVE BEEN A LICENSED REALTOR FOR TWENTY FIVE PLUS YEARS. AND WHAT I REALLY WANT TO POINT OUT IS THAT IT THAT THE. THE ASPECT OF BEING ABLE TO MOVE INTO A MORE EXPENSIVE HOME VERSUS JUST SAME VALUE OR LOWER IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIG REASONS. THAT BABY BOOMERS ARE MOVING IS BECAUSE IT LIKELY TO THE KIDS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY THE CRACK KIDS. AND IF YOU MOVING FROM SACRAMENTO TO BECAUSE YOUR KIDS IN THE BAY AREA. YOU'RE NOT THAT THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN BUY HOME YOU CAN REMOVE DOWNSIZING IT'S AN EARLY AND STILL GONNA COST YOU MORE THAN THE HOME YOU'RE CURRENTLY ANSWER THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR. AND THAT'S BLOCKING A LOT OF PEOPLE INTO NOT BEING ABLE I'M TO MOVE FROM WHEREVER THEY ARE. THANK YOU ICE OUGHT TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. HI MY NAME'S LEE RATLEDGE I'M A REAL TURN SACRAMENTO THREE EIGHT YEARS AND I'M OBVIOUSLY GOING TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. COINCIDENTALLY I'M NOT MAKING THIS UP I HAD A REFERRAL THIS MORNING. AND SPOKE WITH THEM AND IT'S AN EIGHTY YEAR OLD MAN IN A SEVENTY EIGHT YEAR OLD WIFE. AND THEY WANT TO TALK TO BE ABOUT MOVING FROM THE ARE IN THE AREA. TO SET OUR SIGHTS. AND. IF ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS I HAD FOR ME WAS ABOUT PROP THIRTEEN AND TAKING THEIR TAX BASES WITH HIM. THE PROPERTY THEY WANT. THE RANGE OF PROBABLY ONE OF OUR TO BE AROUND THREE AND FIFTY THOUSAND. THE HOME THEY BE SELLING. PROBABLY CLOSER TO THREE THEY'RE NOT THERE REALLY DO IT. AND THEY SAID FLAT OUT WE CANNOT MOVE THIS IS NOT PEOPLE GETTING RICH THIS IS NOT PEOPLE. TAKING THEIR TAX BASE IN GOING AND BUYING AN OCEAN FRONT PROPERTY. THESE ARE PEOPLE AND CALIFORNIANS IN SACRAMENTO. THAT JUST THEY WANNA MOVED A PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT. THEY WANNA MOVE WHERE THE LINES TAKEN CARE OF WHERE THE EXTERIOR OF THE HOMES TAKING CARE OF. THAT HOME THEY SELL ON THE ARE IN THE AREA WILL THEN BE FREED UP. TO A FIRST TIME HOMEBUYER. WHICH IS EXACTLY THE DEMOGRAPHIC IS HAVING A HARD FOR THE HARDEST PROBLEM BUYING A HOME. SO THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE I DEAL WITH IT I I TRULY DEAL WITH THAT MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE MY AGE A LOT OF MY CLIENTS ARE BABY BOOMERS ARE OLDER. BUT I HEAR IT I HEAR IT WEEKLY. SO I AM IN STRONG STRONG SUPPORT I THINK IT'S GOING TO FREE UP HOUSING AND GET SOME FOLKS MOVED OUT OF THE HOMES THAT ARE NO LONGER. GOOD FOR THEM AND FREE THAT UP FOR NEW BUYERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SEVEN ARE SIERRA. AND I HAVE BEEN A REAL TO FOR THE LAST FIFTY FIVE YEARS. FIVE OF THE THE TO DEVELOP HERE TO SUPPORT THE FOR SHOULD I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR VOTE. IN A POSITIVE WAY TO HELP PEOPLE BOTH THANK YOU. SO DOCTOR PERCOLATE TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. ARM I AM A SENIOR I'M SEVENTY TWO I'M DOWNSIZING. I'VE LIVED IN THE SAME HOME THIRTY YEARS. THE HOME IS SELLING FOR FOUR TIMES WHAT I PAID FOR. FOUR TIMES. WELL I'M NOT FROM SILICON VALLEY WHERE MIKE MY MAN MY. MY BROTHER HE AREAS WHERE IT'S TWENTY TIMES TYPICALLY. BUT IT ANY RATE IT IS FOUR TIMES THE POINT IS. FROM THAT. I CAN MOVE TO I'M DOWNSIZING I'M GETTING HOME HALF THE SIZE IN THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY. UP WHERE I WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE LAWN IT CETERA THE POINT IS. I'M MAKING A HUGE PROFIT ON THAT. I HAVE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT ISN'T GOING TO BE TAX. BECAUSE OF THE. ONE TIME EXEMPTION. OF MY OWN FEELING IS SENIORS YOU'VE LIVED IN THEIR HOMES A LONG TIME CAN AFFORD. TO MOVE TO OTHER PLACES BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING A LOT OF MONEY WINNER SELA HOUSES. THE OTHER THING IS THIS MEASURE JUST YEAH ALTHOUGH I HEAR CONSIDERABLY ABOUT SENIORS HERE. THIS MEASURE IS ABOUT EVERYBODY. AND IT'S GONNA TAKE AWAY MONEY FROM SPECIAL DISTRICTS IT CETERA. AND IF IT WERE JUST ABOUT SENIORS AND ALLOWING THEM TO MOVE TO A CHEAPER HOME. I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT BUT IT'S ABOUT EVERYBODY AND IT'S ABOUT MOVING TO MORE EXPENSIVE HOMES. AND IT'S ABOUT GETTING THE DISCOUNT IF YOU MOVE ON YOUR TAXES IF YOU MOVE TO A LESS EXPENSIVE HOME. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME I'M. THANK YOU. WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR COMING TO OUR JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING WITHOUT WE ARE TURN FROM THE JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING. AND THEN NOW I AM. IOWA WHO
