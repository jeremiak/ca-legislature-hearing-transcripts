THE NINETEEN YEAR. EARLIER THIS MONTH WE ALSO BELIEVE NINETY FIVE PAGES OF GUIDANCE THIS ELEAZAR AS THEY WORK ON DEVELOPING THEIR PLANS FOR EXPANDING THE U. K. WHICH ARE DUE TO THEIR LOCAL GOVERNING BOARDS OR BODIES FOR CONSIDERATION JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR. THIS CD PLANS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE IN THE COMING MONTHS. TO DEVELOP BOTH THE TEMPLATE AND THE GUIDANCE IS THE FOR ELEAZAR IN THEIR YOU CAME.

WITH ALSO HOSTED MULTIPLE WEBINARS WITH OVER A THOUSAND BECAUSE- I'M- TO UNDERSTAND THAT PLANNING TEMPLATE WORKFORCE NEEDS AND ADDRESS PRESCHOOL OR PRE KINDERGARTEN TO THIRD GRADE ALIGNMENT. AND HOW TO BETTER WORK AND LEVERAGE THEIR COMMUNITY PARTNERS. AS PART OF. THE U. K. PROVIDES A- INCREDIBLE OFFER. TO THINK. IF TO WE ARE SO AS THE STATE. AS WE LOOK AT THE DATA FOR TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THERE WERE OVER A MILLION THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SPACES IN OUR STATE TO SERVE AS CHILDREN BETWEEN OUR CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM FOR C. S. B. P. T. K. AND HEAD START AND OTHER STATE AND CHILD CARE SUBSIDIES THAT ARE ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. THERE WERE ONLY THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN IF THIS. AND SOMETIMES CHILDREN ARE ENROLLED WITH MULTIPLE FUNDING SOURCES. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CHILDREN SIR BETWEEN ARE SUBSIDIZED BRIEFCASE SYSTEM AND SUCH A CHILD CARE WAS LESS THAN THAT AMOUNT. THIS MEANS THAT LESS THAN ONE THIRD OF THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA ACCESS TO PUBLIC PRE K. PROCESS I FELT. ACTUALLY HELPED. HAS JUST UNDER EIGHT HUNDRED LATE INTO FOR CHILDREN BIRTH TO AGE TWELVE OVERALL. THEY'RE NOT ALL UNDER AGE NEED NOT BRING CARE. IS SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT DO YOU. CALIFORNIA LACKS THE CAPACITY TO MEET CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. EVEN WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR CALIFORNIA'S DECREASE THE PROGRAM AND WHERE FAMILIES ARE SERVED WE KNOW THAT OUT AS- WE HAD ONLY ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND THREE YEAR OLD. OUT OF OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ELIGIBLE THREE YEAR OLDS. THAT MEANS WE SENT LESS THAN 13% OF OUR ELIGIBLE THREE YEAR OLD IN OUR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. THIS REPRESENTS ABOUT 8% OF ALL THREE WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO DURING PRESCHOOL PROGRAM SERVE NEARLY A HUNDRED KIDS OUT. THERE ABOUT KNOWING THIS WE LOOK FORWARD S. T. K. WILL BE ABLE TO TAKE UP MORE AND MORE OF OUR FOUR YEAR OLD. EMAILS THAT THOSE ELIGIBLE SPACES RIGHT NOW SERVING FOUR YEAR OLDS AND SAFETY FROM MEANS THAT WE WOULD STILL NEED TWICE THE NUMBER OF SLOTS TO EXPRESS OUR THREE YEAR OLD. AND MOVING FORWARD. MAYBE K. TRULY PROVIDES AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLD CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY PRE K. THE YEAR BEFORE KINDERGARTEN. AND POTENTIALLY EVEN THIRTEEN OLD GIRL SMS THE PROPOSAL FROM.

YES THAT THE ADDITIONAL ON WHEN THREE THIRTEEN PER STUDENT ADD UP TO A ADDITIONAL. RIGHT NOW AND BENEFITS PACKAGE EDUCATOR ADULTS WOULD MOST LIKELY BE A PARA EDUCATOR. RESEARCH RELEASED THE POOR THAT ME THE BRICK TEACHER RATIO S. S. FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN RIGHT IMPACTS THE ACADEMIC AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING OF STATE. FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW FROM RESEARCH THAT LOWER STAFF CHILD RATIOS TEND TO BE LESS STRESSFUL FOR TEACHERS WHICH CAN LEAD TO A MORE EMOTIONAL SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR CHILDREN. I YOU THE LOWER STAFF TELEVISION AS ALLOW FOR AFFECT USE GROUP IS. WHICH CAN INCREASE CHILDREN'S EXPOSURE TO LANGUAGE RICH INTERACTIONS WITH ADULTS AND PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM TO ENGAGE WITH ME. YES LAST WEEK LOWER STAFF TURNOVER RATE HAVE.

WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO PAN TO WHICH IS TO LOCAL PER. IN THE FIRST OF THE THREE SPEAK. WILL BE RE ANDRADE THIS AND OF THE SALINAS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT- WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING ON A WHEELCHAIR LAYERED AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE- CENTERS MANAGER BONDS MY NAME IS REBECCA AND WRITE A AND I'M THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE SALINAS CITY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICT. I BEGAN SERVING IN THIS ROLE IN JULY TWENTY TWENTY. OUR DISTRICT IS LOCATED IN MONTEREY COUNTY AND WE ARE ONE OF THE THIRD LARGEST DISTRICTS IN MONTEREY COUNTY WE SERVE STUDENTS IN PRESCHOOL THROUGH GRADE SIX AT FIFTEEN SCHOOLS. LET ME START BY STATING HOW APPRECIATIVE I AM FOR BOTH THE EXTENDED LEARNING AND THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND PRESCHOOL EXPANSION THAT OUR LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNMENT IS PROVIDING. THE OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE POSITIVE STUDENT OUTCOMES IS MUCH MORE ATTAINABLE WHEN THESE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE AS WELL AS THE ABILITY TO MOVE OUR COMMUNITIES OUT OF POVERTY. I AM GRATEFUL AS A PROFESSIONAL AND ALSO AS A PARENT. FROM A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE I WAS A STUDENT WHO WOULD WALK FROM MY HIGH SCHOOL TO PICK UP MY YOUNGER SIBLING WHO HAD BEEN WAITING OUTSIDE OF HIS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND SUPERVISED. MANY TIMES WE THEN WALKED TO OUR LOCAL LIBRARY AND WAITED. FOR MANY HOURS UNTIL OUR PARENTS WHO EACH WORK SEVERAL JOBS WOULD PICK US UP AT SIX OR SOMETIMES SEVEN PM OR WHEN THE LIBRARY WAS CLOSING. IN MY EARLY CAREER AS A TEACHER I ALSO HAD SO MUCH OF MY SALARY GO TO PROVIDE FOR PRESCHOOL AND CHILD CARE. FOR MAKING TWO SONS AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS THE REALITY THAT MANY YOUNG EDUCATORS STILL FACE TODAY. MY EXPERIENCE AND AT THE EDUCATION FIELD INCLUDES NOT JUST- PRINCIPLE BUT ALSO DIRECTOR OF EXTENDED A PRESCHOOL. AND I HAVE SERVED IN PASADENA AND GLENDALE. I MENTION THIS BECAUSE I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE HOW IT IS THAT A SYSTEM CAN PROVIDE. SERVICES AND PROGRAMS FROM SIX THIRTY AM TO SIX PM. WE ARE NOT ALL AT THE SAME LEVEL OF READINESS AND THIS IS WHY I WANTED YOU TO HEAR THE PERSPECTIVE THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. THERE IS A PERSISTENT STAFFING SHORTAGE AND IN OUR AREA IS CORRELATED TO A SCAR CITY OF WORKFORCE HOUSING THAT HINDERS RECRUITMENT EFFORTS. THE NECESSARY FACILITY UPGRADES ARE CONSIDERABLE AND REQUIRE APPROVAL FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF SCHOOL ARCHITECTS AND THE FORMATION OF BOARD ADVISORY COMMITTEES ON SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION AS A CURRENT FUNDING IS INSUFFICIENT. THE PACE OF ADDING ANOTHER PUBLIC GROUP HEALTH TO BROWN ACT GUIDELINES CHALLENGES THE PACE AT WHICH THE WORK- TO MEET THIS MANDATE WILL MOVE IN OUR DISTRICT. THE U. PICKET GUIDANCE UP CAKE ITEMS WHICH- COVERS TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN NAMED- YOU BECAME PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE VOLUME ONE. THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT IT IS A VERY COMPREHENSIVE VERY APPRECIATED IT WAS RECEIVED BY DISTRICTS AND EVERY SEVENTEEN. THE DEADLINE TO PROVIDE A BOARD APPROVED PLAN IS JUNE THIRTIETH APPLICATIONS TO EXPAND STATE PRESCHOOL- THE MANAGEMENT BULLETIN FOR CSP PIECE WAS PROVIDED YESTERDAY EVERY TWENTY EIGHT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU IS THERE ANY ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUTRIGHT FUNDING NOT JUST THROUGH GRANTS. IS THERE ANY FURTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY AS WITH THE REQUIRED TWENTY FOUR E. C. UNITS. LOCAL COLLEGES FROM COMMUNITY TO FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS EXPAND THE CURRENT CATALOG OF OFFERINGS SOME OF US HERE THATTHERE ARE BARRIERS WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO ENROLL IN OUR SYSTEM TO WORK ON COURSE WORK FOR EDUCATION BECAUSE THE CREDENTIALING REQUIREMENTS ARE ONLY OFFERED IN THE SPRING. OR SOMETIMES ONLY OFFERED IN THE FALL DELAYING THEIR CREDENTIALING. COULD THERE BE INCENTIVES FOR ELLIE AS AND OTHER LOCAL ENTITIES TO OFFER TEACHER WORKFORCE HOUSING IN THEIR AREA. AND I RETURNED TO COULD PERHAPS SOME OF THE SURPLUS IN OUR STATE BUDGET BE ALLOCATED FOR THIS WILL IMPLEMENTATION. THNK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE ALL THIS WITH YOU AND KNOW THAT WE ARE FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS AND ARE INTERESTED IN DEVELOPING A SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS POLICY. PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE ARE MANY NEW SUPERINTENDENTS IN OUR STATE CURRENTLY AND MORE EXPECTED. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- THEN WE WILL ALL HOLD QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END OF EVERYBODY ON THE PNEL IN OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS TANDY TAYLOR THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES FOR THE CYPRESS SCHOOL DISTRICT- WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. GOOD MORNING SHARE LAYERED MANY MEMBERS. NAME'S DANNY TAYLOR FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY ALSO ONE OF RECOGNIZED THE CITY AND THE COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION PROVIDE US- EXTRA EXCELLENT RESOURCES. SCHOOL IS A PASSIONATE SUBJECT OF MINE. I WAS THE YOUNG CHILD YOU ARE TRYINGTO SERVE THE CHILD OF A HIGH SCHOOL PREGNANCY. OF A CONSTRUCTION WORKER AND WAITRESS. I WAS A YOUNG MOTHER WHO WAS DESPERATE FOR A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM WHEN I HAS BEEN WAS TEMPORARILY DISABLE I WAS WORKING FULL TIME AND GOING TO SCHOOL FULL TIME. I WAS A PRESCHOOL TEACHER WHO BECAME A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER. I WAS ASKED. AND NOW I'M AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES OF THE CYBER SCHOOL DISTRICT WHO OVERSEES THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. I'M ALSO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION EDUCATION STATE COUNCIL PRESIDENT FOR ACCESS OR THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS THAT TELLS ME UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL IS WHAT IS GOOD AND RIGHT FOR THE CHILDREN OF OUR GREAT STATE. THIS IS A HISTORIC TIME WITH INVESTMENT AMBITION FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. AS LEADERS WE NEED TO ENSURE WE DO IT RIGHT. AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO THIS IS TO MAKE SURE WE ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES BEFORE US DAUNTING. WHEN OTHER SOLUTIONS AND I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS. WHAT I'VE DONE IS LISTEN AND TALK TO MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE STATE. AND I COME BEFORE YOU NOT ONLY WITH TH CHALLENGES BUT ALSO WITH SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION. AS YOU HEARD THE SAUDIS. IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE URBAN SUBURBAN RURAL LARGE OR SMALL. WE NEED SPACE. AND WE NEED BATHROOMS THAT ARE MADE FOR LITTLE ONES AND WE NEED PLACE SPACES. AND WIRE FACILITY SO IMPORTANT TO SMALL YOUNG CHILDREN. THE FULLY SUPPORT YOUNG CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT EMOTIONAL PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE. SKILLS CHILDREN NEED ENOUGH SPACE TO ENSURE. IN PLAY BASED LEARNING. ELDER APPROPRIATE SIZE BATHROOMS INAPPROPRIATE. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE. FOUR YEAR OLD SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WALK OUTSIDE TO USE THE RESTROOM AND THEY REALLY SHOULDN'T BE AFRAID OF FALLING IN THE TOILET HERE. WE NEED FUNDS EARMARKED FOR THESE PURPOSES. WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY LOCATIONS GET THE RENFREW GOALS AND COMPLETE THE INSTALLATION. AND IF YOU'VE EVER DONE CONSTRUCTION YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT A QUICK PROCESS. THE OTHER AREA STAFFING ISSUE PART. AND THIS IS MULTI FACETED WE CURRENTLY HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THE T. K. CLASSROOMS AND MAY NEED TIME TO FINISH GETTING ALL OF THEIR OPINIONS IT WOULD BE IDEAL TO HAVE THE EXTENSION OF THE CURRENT. AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR THEM TO OBTAIN THEIR UNITS WE ALSO NEED REALISTIC SOLUTIONS FOR CREDENTIALING AND WE KNOW THEY'RE BEING WORKED ON BUT THIS NEEDS TO BE NOT ONLY PART GENERAL EDUCATION BUT ALSO SPECIAL EDUCATION. BUT ALSO ARE PERMITTED EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION TEACHERS OR INTIMATELY KNOWLEDGEABLE IN THE FOUNDATIONAL SKILLS ASSESSMENTS AND ROOM ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS. ADDITIONAL WE ARE ALL STRUGGLING WITH STAFF SHORTAGES AND WE NEED REAL INCENTIVES TO BRING PEOPLE INTO THE FIELD. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO COMPETE WITH LOCAL BUSINESSES WHO CAN OFFER FREE COLLEGE SIGNING BONUSES AND PICK YOUR OWN SCHEDULE AS WELL AS WORK FROM HOME. FOR DISTRICTS THAT HAVE THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON CORCORAN WE NEED ORDERED FOR NATION. WE NEED LICENSING EXAM BUILT INTO THE BILL WITHOUT IT SCHOOLS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATE THEIR PROGRAMS IN SCHOOL BASED PROGRAMS AND WITH EXPANDED LEARNING. WE NEED TO FULLY FUND BY ENROLLMENT NOT ABA AS BEING CONSIDERED FOR SCHOOLS. WE ALSO NEED NEW ALLOCATIONS FOR EXPANDING INTO TWO YEAR OLD BE ABLE TO CONVERT FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY REASONS. TWO YEAR OLD CANNOT USE FOUR YEAR OLD MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT. IF YOU'VE EVER DEALT WITH THE TWO YEAR OLD IMAGINE HAVING TWENTY FOUR OF THEM. NOW LET US NOT FORGET OUR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS ENGLISH LEARNERS FOSTER YOU AND OTHER CHILDREN. THAT HAVE EARLY THAT NEED EARLY SUPPORTS WE NEED AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP AND TRAIN. ON WELL DESIGNED INCLUSIVE INTEGRATED PROGRAMS. OUR FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE UNIQUELY THEIR OWN AGE GROUP WHAT THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT. OWN DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS THIS IS NOT A MODIFIED KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM WITH OUR EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS NEED TIME. DO THE PANDEMIC JUST SHORTLY GO EVERY DAY WHEN I WOKE UP WE DID NOT KNOW WHICH JOB WE WOULD BE DOING IN THE MORNING MANY OF US TODAY ARE JUST COMING UP FOR AIR AS YOU HEARD THE GUIDANCE WAS JUST PRETTY PLEASE WITH PLANTS THAT ARE DUE. IN JUNE. WE NEED TIME TO DO THESE PROPERLY AND MANY PEOPLE. BEFORE MY DAD PASSED AWAY EVERY TIME HE TALKED TO ME HE WAS HUMBLED THAT A BLUE COLLAR WORKER AND REYES MANAGEMENT. HE WOULD TELL ME HOW PROUD HE WAS AND HE WOULD SHOW ME MY BUSINESS CARD. AND HE WOULD SAY. IT'S YOUR TURN TO MAKE AN IMPACT. I APPROACH EVERY DAY TO MAKE MY DAD PROUD. IT IS WITH ALL MY HEART THAT I KNOW TODAY IS THAT MOMENT. AS I LOOK AT THE YOUNG CHILDREN RESEARCH SIR I KNOW WE CAN MAKE. AND SHAPE THE FUTURE. I BELIEVE OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO A DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE IN CHALLENGING EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM THAT IS INTEGRATED WITH LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS. IMPLEMENTED BY WELL TRAINED COMPETENT AND NURTURING STAFF. I JUST ASK YOU TO GIVE US THE RESOURCES. EQUIPMENT AND MOST OF ALL TIME. TIME TO DO IT RIGHT. THANK. R. I'M SORRY THE OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH A QUESTION CAME. OUR WEATHER THIS SITE PER SCHOOL DISTRICT IS THE CYPRUS IT'S AN ORANGE COUNTY IS THAT CORRECT CORRECT OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND WILL HOLD ALL QUESTIONS ON SUBSTANCE TO LAUGHTER BOTH PANELS IN. THE NEXT BOB PANELIST IN THE LAST ON THIS WOMAN LOCAL PERSPECTIVES IS JENNIFER HICKS THE ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATIONAL SERVICES FOR THE PLASTER COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU HAVE A BURNING TRAILER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M JENNIFER HANDS ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATIONAL SERVICES THAT THE PLASTER COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION.

WE PROVIDE ACCESS TO SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE WE RUN THE LOCAL PLANNING COUNCIL AND THE CHILD RESOURCE NETWORK WRITTEN REFERRAL NETWORK. FIRST I TO TAKE A FEW MOMENTS THIS MORNING TO SHARE HOW WE ARE WORKING TO SUPPORT OUR ELEAZAR IN TRANSITIONING TO SERBIA ALL THE CASE. AND FOUR YEAR OLDS. I'M RECENTLY IN JANUARY THROUGH SAYS CAN SEE FAST THAT WE PUBLISHED A UNIVERSAL PLANNING TOOL KIT WHICH IS A RESOURCE GUIDE FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. AND IS MEANT TO BE A COMPANION DOCUMENT TO THE UNIVERSAL PRE KINDERGARTEN PLANNING TEMPLATE WHICH MISSED LEVEL MORGAN JUST PREFERRED TO. THE COUNTY OFFICE TOOL KIT PROVIDES RESOURCES AND APPROACHES AND EXAMPLES IN INFORMATION FOR COUNTY OFFICES TO SUPPORT DIFFERENT DISTRICTS. AROUND AREAS OF HE THREE VISION AND COHERENCE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND PARTNERSHIPS WORKFORCE RECRUITMENT AND PROFESSIONAL LEARNING. CURRICULUM INSTRUCTION AND ASSESSMENT AND FACILITIES. SERVICES AND OPERATIONS. YOU'RE A CLASSIC OFFICE OFFICE BUDGET. WE'VE BEEN MEETING WITH ALL OF OUR ELEAZAR BEGINNING LAST OCTOBER WE MEET MONTHLY AS A U. P. K. NETWORK AND WE USE THIS TIME TO COLLABORATE TO SHARE RESOURCES AND INFORMATION. TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SHARE IDEAS AND PROBLEM SOLVED. FROM THIS GROUP WE HAVE DEVELOPED A WORK GROUP THAT'S CALLED THE CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTION UTK WORKGROUP. THIS IS A GROUP THAT'S WORKING ON CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT AND ENSURING THAT THE TEACHING CURRICULUM THAT ARE LEDS WILL BE USING. A BALANCE OF DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE ACTIVITIES SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING AND ACADEMICS. IN ADDITION DURING THESE MONTHLY PEAK WORK MEETING AND ARE COUNTY DONE BY CHIU BASE PARTNER. SUCH AS HEADS THE LOCAL TO CHAO THE RESTORE EMERGED MATT. AND OTHER AFTER SCHOOL AND CARE PROVIDERS IN OUR COMMUNITY TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS WITH US AND HELP PROBLEM SOLVED AND THINK THROUGH HOW WE CAN BEST PROVIDE AN ALLIANCE AND COMPARING U. P. K. SYSTEM. ADDITION COUNTY OFFICE ARE PLAYING A STRONG IN SUPPORTING AND BUILDING THE CAPACITY FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. FOR EXAMPLE TCO WE SUBMITTED ONE OF THOSE LETTERS OF INTENT AND FITNESS NOBLE NOR GET MORTGAGE AND REFERENCED EARLIER FOR THE EARLY EDUCATION TEACHER DEVELOPMENT GRANT. WE SUBMITTED ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTY AS WELL AS SIX OTHER SMALLER COUNTY OFFICES IN OUR IMMEDIATE REGION. OUR INTENT AS THE COUNTY OFFICES TO PROVIDE MULTIPLE PATHWAYS FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN CAREERS IN P. THREE EDUCATION. AND I'LL SHARE SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE FIRST WE HAVE ALREADY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE SIERRA COLLEGE. AND WE ARE PROVIDING ACCESS AND STARTING A COHORT THIS MARCH THAT WILL PROVIDE TWENTY FOUR ECT UNITS OF COURSE WORK FOR ALL OF OUR CURRENT MULTIPLE SUBJECT TEACHERS THAT NEED TO ADD THOSE TWENTY FOUR UNITS. IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE TO TEACH THREE K. OUR FIRST COHORT AS I MENTIONED BEGINS IN MARCH AND THEY WILL COMPLETE THOSE TWENTY FOUR UNITS WITHIN TWO YEARS WHICH COINCIDES WITH THE DEADLINE. FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION. I IN ADDITION OUR PARTNERS WITH YOUR CALL A WE AND- TO DEVELOP A THREE AND CRITIC PRO. ONCE A PRE BY THE ON TEACHER. AS A COUNTY WEEK PROVIDE. OTHER SPECIES APPROVED CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS SO OUR INTENT IS TO ADD THIS TO OUR PORTFOLIO IN SUPPORT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN THIS AREA. WE WILL ALSO BE PROVIDING ACCESS TO THOSE TWENTY FOUR UNITS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION CREDITS THROUGH SIERRA COLLEGE FOR ALL OF OUR EARLY EDUCATORS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN ADVANCING THEIR CAREERS AND EARLY EDUCATION. FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE WHO IS AN ASSOCIATE TEACHER AND I STATE PRESCHOOL CAN TAKE ADDITIONAL UNITS- WITH SIERRA COLLEGE BEYOND PROMOTES U. S. SITE SUPERVISOR OR A MASTER TEACHER. AND THEN FINALLY THROUGH THIS GRANT OUR HOPE IS TO PROVIDE GENERAL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR BOTH TEACHERS AND PARA EDUCATOR PARA EDUCATORS. ON EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT SO THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO BETTER SUPPORT T. PAY LIMITATION IN THE CLASSROOM. AS PART OF AB ONE THIRTY THE CALIFORNIA PRE KINDERGARTEN PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION GRANT PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FUNDING EXPLICITLY FOR COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO SUPPORT COUNTY WHY'D YOU BE K. PLANNING CAPACITY BUILDING. WHILE THESE FUNDS ARE ONE TIME OUR HOPE IS THAT ONGOING FUNDING WILL ALLOW COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION TO PROVIDE THIS CRITICAL SUPPORT COORDINATION AND TECHNICAL SYSTEMS ON A LONG TERM BASIS. I'D ALSO LIKE TO SHARE SOME EXAMPLES ABOUT HOW OUR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE ADAPTING TO THE CHANGING NEEDS OF U. T. PAY. FIRST WE IN OUR COMMUNITY ARE ADVOCATING AND SUPPORTING AND NEXT DELIVERY SYSTEM WHICH INCLUDES TRANSITIONAL KERR KINDERGARTEN STATE PRESCHOOL HEAD START COMMUNITY BASED ON FAMILY CHILD CARE SYSTEMS AND WE REALLY SEE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND SERVICE TO MORE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN OUR COMMUNITY. OUR INTENT IS TO EXPAND OUR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM INTO SPECIFIC AREAS FIRST TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO TWO YEAR OLDS FOR SPACE ALLOWANCE AND ONCE WE GET CHANGING TABLES PURCHASED FOR DIAPERING. I'M IN SECOND IS WE HAVE BEEN MEETING WITH ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS WHO HOSTS THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM ON THEIR SITE AND DISCUSSING EXPANSION THROUGH INTO A BLENDED DELIVERY MODEL THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE AUSTRIAN OF NINE HOURS OF PROGRAMMING. SO FOR EXAMPLE A CHILD COULD GO TO A DISTRICT HE CAME PROGRAM IN THE MORNING AND THEN WALK ACROSS CAMPUS AND GO TO A STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IN THE AFTERNOON. THEN THEY WOULD ONLY BE REQUIRED TO HAVE A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL HOURS OF EXTENDED CARE THAT ALLOWS THE DISTRICT YOU HAVE ONE TEACHER TEACHING AND KIÞM CLASS AND THEN WE PROVIDE AN A. M. AND PM STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. WE'RE ALSO ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THE CHILD'S DEVELOPMENTAL NEEDS ARE BEING MET THROUGH. TRADITIONAL PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. I'M ACTUALLY ME WITH THE IN. FOLLOWING SESSION M. AS WE EXPANDING TO PLANT TO EXPAND AT THREE OF THEIR SCHOOL SITES. ONE OF OUR GOALS THROUGH THIS WORK AS COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION IS TO REALLY EMPHASIZE AND DEVELOP THIS IDEA OF THE P. THREE CONTINUE ONE. AND TO BE LOOKING AT EDUCATION FROM THIS PERSPECTIVE WE PLASTER COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF HIRING A P. THREE COORDINATOR TO SUPPORT THIS WORK WITH THE BIG EMPHASIS ON ALIGNING CURRICULUM ACROSS P. THREE. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR DISTRICT STAFF TO VISIT- HIGH QUALITY STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. ONE OF OUR LESSONS LEARNED THROUGH THIS PROCESS SINCE LAST OCTOBER IS THAT WE HAVE WORK TO DEAL AND EDUCATING OUR ELEAZAR. AROUND WHAT THE NEXT DELIVERY MODEL COULD LOOK LIKE MANY WERE SIMPLY NOT AWARE OF THE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOUR YEAR OLD CHILDREN SUCH AS STATE PRESCHOOL SUBSIDIZED PROGRAMS AND SOME OF THE OTHERS THAT I MENTIONED EARLIER. ARE ALSO ENGAGING IN DISCUSSION AND BRAINSTORMING AROUND MARKETING AND COMMUNICATION HOW DO WE BEST INFORM OUR FAMILIES. OF THE DIFFERENT CHOICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THEM FOR THEIR FOUR YEAR OLD. FINALLY I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND SHARE DEEP APPRECIATION FOR THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. IN CVS AS WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED IN A BOTTLE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION. HI THANK YOU. THANK YOU- APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO QUESTIONS NOW AND IN A MOMENT I'M GOING TO ASK EVERY MEMBER OF PANEL ONE. TO COMMENT ON WHAT WAS STATED IN PANEL TWO SO THAT WE CAN HAVE A FEEDBACK ON SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED BY THE- LOCAL PERSPECTIVE BUT MAYBE. IN A MOMENT BEFORE WE DO THAT I CAN FRAME THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT. THAT IN MANY WAYS. WE JUST DID THIS IN THE LAST BUDGET THE EXPANSION. IT IS GEARING UP WE DO NOT HAVE DATA BECAUSE EXPANSION HASN'T REALLY HAPPENED WE'RE JUST HAVING APPLICATIONS GO OUT AND YET. THE PANELISTS ON THE LOCAL PERSPECTIVES JUST RAISED A LIST OF CONCERNS AND THEIR CONCERNS THAT IF WE CAN ADDRESS THEM NOW WILL NOT BE MORE CUTE NEXT YEAR WHEN WE'RE HAVING THE SAME OVERSIGHT AFTER THE IMPLEMENTATION ACTUALLY STARTS AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES NOW. AS THE IMPLEMENTATION RAMPS UP SO WHAT WE GO THROUGH ALL THREE MEMBERS OF A PANEL ONE STARTING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEN THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST AND THEN. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND ASK IF YOU WOULD COMMENT ON WHAT WE HEARD FROM LOCAL PERSPECTIVES AND ALL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WE KNOW GRANT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WAS DEFINITELY HELPFUL TO HEAR THE LOCAL PERSPECTIVES AND WE'RE CERTAINLY AWARE OF THE STAFFING SHORTAGE IT'S AN ISSUE THAT. KIND OF SPANS ACROSS OUR VARIOUS INVESTMENTS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET A WE'RE AWARE OF THIS ISSUE AND- WE'RE JUST WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO BE SENSITIVE AND IN THE WAY WE- YOU KNOW IMPLEMENT SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDING SOME FLEXIBILITIES AND- KIND OF IMPLEMENTATION- FLEXIBILITY. KNOWING THAT THESE ISSUES ARE ARE PERSISTENT AND- SAME GOES FOR FACILITIES- ISSUES IS NOT MY AREA OF EXPERTISE BUT I- I'M AWARE THAT MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE ARE ALSO THAT HAVE BEEN HEARING THE SAME ISSUES. IN THEIR DIFFERENT AREAS SO WE'RE ACTIVELY- TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AS WE- YOU KNOW WORK ON DEVELOPING AND IMPROVING OUR- OUR GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL OR THE MAY REVISION- AND THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D SPECIFICALLY WANTED ME TO COMMENT ON HAPPY TO OR MY COLLEAGUE CHRIS FERGUSON.

KNOWING THAT WE HAVE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED LETTERS OF INTENT I REQUEST AROUND THOSE FUNDS RIGHT NOW. AND KNOWING THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THEM AND IT IS WITH IN HIGHER ED AS PART OF THAT WELL TO REALLY ADDRESS BOTH THE TWENTY FOUR UNIT. MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE APPLICABLE TO WORKING WITH YOUNGER CHILDREN AND OTHER ACCESSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE A TEACHING CREDENTIAL HE GOT TRAIL WE ALSO WANT TO LIFT UP OUR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IN THEIR TEACHERS AND PART OF THAT SAID THAT. THOSE SUPPORTS ACROSS THAT PLATE THING ARE THERE ANYTHING THIS TAKES REALLY SPENT TWO MUCH TIME. AT LEAST. HEARING FROM ALL OF THEM NEED FOR. NOT JUST THE ROOM IF THEY- FELT BUT HE THE BATHROOM THE TOILET. THE STATE. THAT WATER FOUND. WHERE THE PLAYGROUNDS. THE HARDWARE. CAN TO DROP. AT THE ACT USUALLY TO. AND WALK THERE FOR YOUR OWN IN THE REALLY. SURE SOME OF THE ISSUES AROUND PARKING ENTRANCE THE- THOUGH WHERE THERE NEED TO BE PROCESS FACED SAYS HAVE YOU. MOVE ENTRANCE. OF YEAR OLD.

AND OTHERS ARE REALLY EXPRESSING THAT THEY MIGHT NEED A COUPLE ADDITIONAL YEARS. TO BE ABLE TO FULLY IMPLEMENTED. THANK YOU K. AND U. PK BECAUSE OF THOSE ISSUES AROUND TEACHERS. AND FACILITY- I'M- TRYING TO THINK IF THERE WAS MORE THERE. LIKE THAT THE COMMISSION I TEACHER CREDENTIALING IS WORKING ON THAT YEAH THREE. AND FOUR THE THEY HAVE A GROUP THAT'S REALLY DIVING IN VERY QUICKLY. AND KUDOS. DANNY TINA ATP FOR THAT WE ARE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL OF OUR SUPPORT AROUND YOU CAME WITH THEM. AND STILL NEED VERY REGULARLY ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE WORK. HAPPY PAID PLAYING NEED. ANY OTHER PURPOSE. BRING UP FROM SOME OF THE OF THE COMPANIES. ISSUES AROUND OUR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM MAKING SURE THAT THAT. IS THAT THE TEACHERS AND THAT COMPENSATION. AS YOU LOOK AT TWO YEAR OLD ENTERING PRE K.

BILL THE LEADER IT'S SOMETHING THAT TV IS A ABOUT. BUT DOES IT WILL LOOK FOR HIGH LIKE THE NEW TO ADDRESS THE T. AS WELL AS- DESIGN LEARNING LEARNING SO THAT EMPIRE AND NOT EIGHT WHEN WE REALLY AREN'T SURE. THAT AND- IS OF ANY UNIVERSAL KINDERGARTEN MOVE TO ENACT THAT CAN IS MAKING ANY OTHER PART WITH THAT IS THE FOR YOUR DEALING WITH. AND HER A LITTLE BIT OF THAT BUT WILL BRING IT UP EVEN MORE NO THAT THINK HELLO. FAMILIES THAT A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN. THAT WE HIGHLIGHT THE NEED TO WITH. AND STUFF DUOLINGO LEARNING AND MAKE SURE THAT TEACH WORK FOR I. IS ABLE TO MORE. TO GET SUPPORT WILL IMMERSION PROGRAM. THEN HAVE BEEN REJOINED EARTH YOU FOR THE COMMENTS WE BEEN REJOINED BY. A CABRAL OF THE- ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WILL RECOGNIZE YOU FOR ANY COMMENTS IN RESPONSE. YES THANK YOU AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE TECHNICAL ISSUES- I'M- JUST NOT- I THINK MANY OF THE CONCERNS THAT- THE BELL BOTTOM ON PANEL TO MENTIONED- MARK OUR ISSUES THAT WE HAVE. HEARD BEFORE- WE RECOGNIZE THAT. THERE IS A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE OF. WITH FACILITIES AND STAFFING AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO MONITOR. AS IT IMPLEMENTS- THESE PROGRAMS THAT PROVISIONAL CAN ARE NAY WOOD IT IS FIVE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN THAT ARE BEING STARTED SO I'M RECOGNIZE. THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME- NEED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ADDRESS ISSUES. I THINK WHAT WHEN IT COMES TO- IT ALL WATER RECORD THINK OBVIOUSLY THE LEAD AWAY MONITOR AND SEE WHAT WHAT ISSUE. ARISE. IT IS ALSO A THE WAY THEY WE APPROACH THIS BUDGET I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE YOU KNOW THERE ARE SO- SIGNIFICANT- THINGS THAT WERE A AGREED UPON LAST YEAR BUT IN THE BUDGET. UNIVERSAL TRADITION KINDERGARTEN BEING ONE OF THEM- IN ADDITION EXAMPLE UNIVERSAL MEALS ON THE TELEVISION SIDE I THINK WE TAKE THAT THE PERSON WE'VE TAKEN TO REVIEWING THE PROPOSALS THIS YEAR IS THAT THOSE ARE THE PRIORITY BECAUSE THOSE HAVE BEEN AGREED UPON AND IF THE- IF THERE ARE CAPACITY ISSUES WOULD BE AVAILABLE BUT PERHAPS WE SHOULD SAY DO FEWER THINGS IN THIS BUDGET. YOUR NEW DIGS SO FOR EXAMPLE ON THE GLOVES THAT YOU CAN DO IS SAY NOT ADOPT AS MANY NEW COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAMS OR IMPLEMENT NEW INITIATIVES AND FOCUS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE THAT ARE THAT ARE- PART OF WHAT LAST YEAR. I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THESE ISSUES THAT CAN BE VERY COMPLICATED AS WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT CAN BE A CHALLENGE THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN WAS FEES BEEN IN PART TO TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES BUT- WE KNOW THAT THE STAFFING- ISSUES HAVE BEEN PROPERLY SUBSTANTIAL. ONE THING I WOULD NOTE- JUST A SMALL PIECE BUT IN TERMS OF THE TWENTY FOUR UNITS ARE OF YOU SEE THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED THIS WAS A REQUIREMENT- WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE EFFECT IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOUR- TRADITIONAL GUITAR TEACHERS TO HAVE TWENTY FOUR UNITS EVERY CD. THAT IN THE LAST BUDGET WAS DELAYED TO AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF BUFFER BUT ONE UNDER CURRENT LAW ONCE YOU GET THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR THE EXPECTATION OF THAT- TAKING PICTURES HAVE THOSE UNITS AND SO. I THINK THAT'S THAT'S PART OF THE CONCERN THAT THAT READING IT'S NOT AN ISSUE RIGHT NOW WITH GETTING TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM NOW BUT IT WILL BE. AND IN. THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR FISCAL YEAR. I THANK YOU ARE ARMED OF. UP WITH QUESTION FISH. TO THOSE THREE PER. BUT BEFORE I THAT. LET ME. BUT OFF OF A CALM. THAT MR COOPER MADE. IN RISK. TO OR RELY. TO A COMMENT MADE BY TEN DETAILER. OF THE CYBER SCHOOL DISTRICT BECAUSE- SHE MENTIONED THAT SHE THOUGHT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO MOVE TO ANOTHER. MOMENT SYSTEMS. UP FROM THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. AND WHILE MANY OF THE SUPPORT THAT. WE HAVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE THAT WOULD WIN AND WAS UNDER THAT. DRAMATICALLY IN MANY CASES THE LOS ANGELES SCHOOL DISTRICT WOULD GAIN OF BILLION DOLLARS UNDER UNDER ENVIRONMENT SYSTEM BUT IF IT REMAINS IN PROP NINETY EIGHT AND IT'S A FIX HI. OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE TO LOSE A BILLION DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO FUND THE MOMENT SYSTEM SO THE WAY THAT IT WILL WORK IS IF WE MADE AN ALLOCATION OF THREE BILLION DOLLARS. SO THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT LOSE ARE HELD HARMLESS BY THOSE THAT GAINED GAINED AND THE AGGREGATE OF THREE BILLION DOLLARS WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT WHEN WE WALKED AT TO WHAT MR CABRAL JUST REFERRED TO. AS TRYING TO NARROW NEW THINGS IN THE ON GOING FUNDING THAT THREE BILLION THEN COMPETES AGAINST MANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO HERE OR THE THREE BILLION FOR HOME TO SCHOOL FOUND- TRANSPORTATION OR THE TWO POINT THREE BILLION THAT WERE SHORT. IN THE INCREASE IN PERSON STORES TO THE DISTRICTS WE COULD BUY THAT DOWN WITH ONE TIME MONEY BUT THEN THAT'S AN ONGOING THING FOR THE NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET IN TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT UNLESS WE- AND WHAT WE HEARD FROM EVERYONE. IN OUR HEARING ON PROP NINETY EIGHT IS THAT THE COST OF LIVING INCREASE IN PROP NINETY EIGHT DOES NOT COVER EXPENSES THAT THAT WE REALLY NEW TO NEED A BIGGER BASE TO K. THROUGH TWELVE DISTRICTS. WITH THE ONGOING PROP NINETY EIGHT MONEY SO AS I MOVED TO THE FACILITIES QUESTION YOU WHAT TO PRIORITIZE ALL THOSE THINGS COMPETE AGAINST EACH OTHER. AND WE ARE TRYING TO MEET THE NEEDS BUT- IT JUST- ADVOCATING FOR MOVE TO THE ENROLLMENT SYSTEM ABSENT DESCRIBING HOW MUCH MONEY IT WOULD COST TO COMPETE AGAINST EVERYTHING ELSE IS JUST SOMETHING I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT. NOT TO DRILL DOWN ON LITTLE WITH. FINANCE CHAU AND- THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON THE CELL WHAT HE'S- THE THING I WANT TO DROP IS THE TIME FOR. BECAUSE WE REALLY ASKING TO EXPAND STARTING IN THE NEXT YEAR THE BUDGET YEAR. AND THEY WILL NEED THE FACILITIES THAT AND EVERYBODY I THINK ALL SIX PANELISTS SAID FACILITIES WERE AN ISSUE AND WE NEED TO DO IT. HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE NEED FOR FACILITIES WHICH WILL START IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT AS PART OF THIS EXPANSION WE HAVE ACTUALLY ADDRESS THAT. TO SYNCHRONIZE WITH EVERYBODY EXPANDING AT IT DURING THE TIME OF THE FACILITIES NAY DID NOT START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINE. GERMAN NOT CHRIS FOR YOU SOME OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCIAL ALL FIELD THAT I THINK. WE PUT FORWARD SEVERAL- WE'VE WE PUT FORWARD A COUPLE CONCEPTS THAT WE THINK CAN BE HELPFUL IN THIS AREA THE FIRST AS WE DEFINITELY ENCOURAGE OUR- LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO BE WORKING WITH. OUR PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS AND OTHER AYE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO BLEND AND BREAK PROGRAMS THAT CAN ULTIMATELY. YOU KNOW PROVIDE FOR A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. TO SERVING THE STUDENTS. OF WE'VE ALSO PUT FORWARD OVER TO YOUR- A PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS. TO SUPPORT THE SCHOOL FACILITIES PROGRAM- WITHIN THAT PROGRAM THE WAY ELIGIBILITY BUT YOU CONSTRUCTION WORKS IT IS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT MANY DISTRICTS WOULD HAVE- ELIGIBILITY FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION FUNDS TO CONSTRUCT CLASSROOMS- FOR I. T. K. SO CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME CORRELATED- PROPOSALS IN THAT AREA. I AND YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY OTHER ALSO LOCAL BONDING RESOURCES IN MANY DISTRICTS THAT CAN BE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THE FACILITIES NEEDS. AS WELL AS THE RECENT DATA FROM. THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHICH INDICATED THAT. THERE WERE SOME- EIGHTY EIGHT DECLINES IN. THE VERY SPECIFIC WE ARE K. THREE THREE YEAH GREAT SPANNER KINDERGARTEN THROUGH GRADE CERTAINLY THERE MAY BE SOME ADDITIONAL CAPACITY YOU KNOW TO SERVE STUDENTS. IN OUR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. PROGRAMS I IN THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR HOUR CHART TWENTY TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR- AS THEY BEGIN TO RAMP UP CERTAINLY WE MONITOR WE'RE MONITORING THAT SITUATION. BUT WE DEFINITELY ENCOURAGE TO HELP YOU KNOW WITH FACILITIES- ARE WORKING TO BLEND IN PRETTY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS TOGETHER AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND BEFORE I MOVED TO THE ONLY- LET ME. DO A COUPLE OF FOLLOW UPS FIRST. YOU MENTIONED FACILITIES MONEY BUT IS THERE IS THAT UNIQUELY FOR THIS PROGRAM OR IS THAT WITHIN THE FACILITIES MONEY THAT IS. SORT OF BRIDGING US THE NEXT YEAR TO FOR ALL. K. THROUGH TWELVE FACILITIES. THAT WOULD BE BRIDGE OUT FOR TAKE FACILITIES SO LOOKING RAIN THAT INCLUDE BY PRE K. WITH THEN COME. FOR DISTRICT THAT DON'T HAVE CAPACITY OR HAVE OUTDATED FACILITIES THAT ARE TRYING TO APPLY FOR MONEY AND THAT THIS WOULD THEN COMPETE WITH THAT IS THAT. OF THE CASE. YES CERTAINLY THAT WOULD BE THE CASE OKAY AND THEN AND THEN ONE COMMENT BEFORE WE MOVE ON- WANTED TO TALK ABOUT LOCAL BONDING CAPACITY. IN MY VIEW THAT THEN BECOMES AN EQUITY ISSUE BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE LOWER INCOME OR DISADVANTAGED DISTRICTS HAVE LESS OF A CAPACITY TO PASS BONDS. AND SO THEN IF WERE LONG ON BONDS TO DO THIS. IT IT REALLY FAVORS DISTRICTS THAT ARE. OUR ADVANTAGE TO THOSE THAT ARE DISADVANTAGED JUST FOR THE RECORD OF WHAT'S MOVED TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST ON DRILLING DOWN ON FACILITIES ANY COMMENTS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. YEAH I THINK WE FOR THE NUMBER OF CONCERNS AS WELL ON THIS ISSUE AND I THINK WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT. WITH OF THESE ISSUES THEY DO TAKE TIME- WE HAVE HEARD. ABOUT THE SEARCH OF THE PROCESS IT TAKES TO GET A BIG. THROUGH THE STATE THROUGH THE- YOU KNOW THE STATE BECAUSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR THE BILL BACK IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A OF A- I'M INTENSIVELY THE PROCESS. I'M I WOULD NOT THAT THE STATE DID IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THERE WAS FOR AND NINE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS PROVIDED. I WAS INTENDED TO BE FOR FACILITIES RELATED EARLY EDUCATION I THOUGHT THIS WAS FUNDING A COULD BE USED FOR. A TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN FOR STATE PRESCHOOL OFFER FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN SO THE STATE HAS PROVIDED SOME FUNDING- A QUESTION WOULD BE WHETHER THERE NEEDS TO BE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. PROVIDED TO MEET THE DEMAND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WORKED OUT. THAT WE ARE MONITORING I THINK THAT THE OPC OF THE WOMEN'S- MONITORING THAT PROGRAM AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION. IT DEFINITELY COULD BE A BETTER THERE MIGHT BE ADDITIONAL FUNDING NEEDED I WOULD NOTE THAT- THAT FUNDING IS NON PROFIT NINETY EIGHT WITH A FUNDING IN GENERAL FUND- SO IT'S- JUST LIKE THE SCHOOL FACILITY GRANT PROGRAM- IS NOT NINETY EIGHT SO IT. DOESN'T COMPETE WITH OTHER EDUCATION. PROGRAMS BUT IT DOES- IT DOES MEAN THAT IT'S COMING OUT OF OTHER THAN THE NOMINEE GENERAL FUND. FIVE IT CAN BE BECAUSE OF FACILITIES AND THEN THAT WOULD BE FOR EXCLUDED FROM THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT IF YOU WERE TO PURSUE THAT OPTION BUT- ARMY IT IS ANOTHER- IT'S ONE WAY TO TRY TO PROVIDED SUPPORT IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE STATE HAS ALREADY. STARTED DO. THANK YOU. JACOB AND ANASTA DEPARTMENT OF A TO RECEIVE- FACILITIES. THANK YOU VERY WORKING WITH DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION THE BUILDING OFF THE MR KRAUSS AND MR FORGET ADD WE CANNOT IGNORE AND APPRECIATE THE OFFICE PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION IS LEADING UP THE SPOT. THOUGH DOING IT IN OVER TO THE SINCE THAT THOSE DISTRICTS ARE READY TO GO. WITH THEIR PLAN TO APPLY THIS YEAR OR A TO FEEL IT AND THEN GIVING A BIT MORE TIME FOR THOSE NEED ADDITIONAL CARE. WE WOULD ECHO MR PROBABLY YOU THINK IT IS SOMETIMES WOULD BE NEED THE FOUR HUNDRED AND MILLION MIGHT NOT A LOT OF FAITH AND HOW STATE AS WE ADDRESS OUR PRESCHOOL T. K. AND KINDERGARTEN FACILITY I THINK AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE CLASSROOMS AND SPACE ARE REALLY APPROPRIATE FOR OUR EARLIEST YOUNGEST LEARNERS. IT IS CRITICAL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE FUNDS AND I WOULD SAY SUPPORTIVE REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS NEEDED IN A SPACE FOR CONSTRUCTION WITH THAT I'M AND ALSO WOULD ECHO THAT OPPORTUNITY TO CURRENTLY OR WITH OTHER PROGRAMS OFFERING YOU DE QUE BUT WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE REALLY HOMELESS DECK AND UNDERSTAND IF THEY'D PROBABLY HAVE TO SELL THE NEEDS AS WELL. AND SAID THAT THAT THOSE FUNDS WOULD BE ADDED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH YOU REALLY ADDRESS. THE NEEDS. THANK YOU M. FIVE QUESTIONS I'M GONNA GO TO MIKE. TO THE SECOND. BUT I HAVE SORT OF A- THIS. QUESTION OF THE- OF FINE. THE THAT ACTUALLY DOES HAS FOR HIM FOR. ACROSS THE STATE AND THAT IS ABOUT. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BASIC K. EIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN. THIS PROGRAM AND- BECAUSE THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM COMES THROUGH THE FORMULA OR THE ALLOCATIONS THAT BASIC AID SCHOOL DISTRICTS DON'T GET. IT APPEARS THAT THE EXPECTATION IS. THAT IF YOUR BASIC EIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FIND THIS OUT OF YOUR OWN RESOURCES WHERE EVERYBODY ELSE IS GETTING SOMETHING IN THE FORMULA. TO DO IT AND THE SAN LUIS COASTAL DISTRICT IN SAN LUIS OBISPO IS VERY UNIQUE THERE ARE BASIC EIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICT. OUR BROAD THEY ALSO HAVE THE DABBLE CANYON NUCLEAR POWER PLANT IN THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE A PLUNGE IN PROPERTY TAXES. OF 9210% THAT WILL COME WHEN IT THE COMMISSION'S MAYBE IN THREE OR THREE AND A HALF YEARS. AND SO ASKING THEM TO TAKE ON WHAT IS THE EQUIVALENT OF 3% OF THEIR TOTAL BUDGET FOR NEW PROGRAM WITH NO REVENUE WITH A FISCAL CLIFF COMING. IS A SCARY THING AND SO I WONDERED IF YOU WOULD ADDRESS WHAT THE SITUATION IS BETWEEN BASIC EIGHT SCHOOLS IN THIS PROGRAM AND- HOW THEY ARE TO BE FUNDED TO IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM. IN A GRANT FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M HAPPY TO TAKE A STAB AT ANSWERING THAT- SO JUST. AS A REMINDER FOR STATUTE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN ISN'T AND ISN'T TO BE CONSTRUED AS A NEW PROGRAM OR IS OFFERING A HIGHER LEVEL OF SERVICE. SO A DISTRICT THAT HAD A KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM- BEFORE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN WAS CREATED SHOULD NOW BE PROVIDING TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN TO ALL. AGE ELIGIBLE KIDS ON THE TIMELINE THAT'S DELINEATED IN STATUTE- IN THE STATE PROVIDES A PORTION MEANT FOR THE STUDENTS THROUGH THE L. CFF. THREE WHICH BASIC AID DISTRICTS GET PROPERTY TAX REVENUES. NO DISTRICTS GET SPECIFIC TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN SET ASIDES AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY YOU LOCAL CONTROL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WAS BUILT. AND BEFORE THIS MOST RECENT BUDGET ACT ALL LGAS WERE EXPECTED TO ENROLL STUDENTS TURNING FIVE BETWEEN SEPTEMBER SECOND AND DECEMBER SECOND. IN A TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM SUBJECT TO THE RECEIPT OF APPORTIONMENT FOR APPORTIONMENT- FOR KIDS AND HE K. SO. ELLIE IS A BE ENTITLED TO THE FULL LC FIVE APPORTIONMENT FOR ANY ADDITIONAL TEA CASE STUDENTS BASED ON AGE ELIGIBILITY TIMELINE THAT SPECIFIED IN STATUTE- AND THE STATUTE EXPANDING TKA I KEEP THOSE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE APPLICABLE SINCE THE CREATION OF T. K. THE BECAUSE OF THIS- THERE IS EXPECTATION THAT. ALL ELEAZAR ARE EXPECTED TO OFFER- TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN TO ALL AGE ALL OF THE ELIGIBLE STUDENTS- AND THE- YOU KNOW IF THEY HAVE A DROP AND IT'S BASICALLY DISTRICTS THE DROP IN. PROPERTY TAXES THAT YOU KNOW DOES NOT STILL THERE ARE. YOU KNOW I'LL SEE IF I **** IT THEN THE STATE PROVIDES STATE TAXES TO FILL THAT BUCKET OTHERWISE- THE FUNDING FORMULA IS CREATED SO THAT. YOU KNOW ALL DISTRICTS AND- ALL ELLIE AS OUR OUR PROVIDED ADEQUATE FUNDING TO SERVE. THEIR STUDENTS FOR THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE PROVIDED. WOMEN TO TRY. THAT WILL BIT BURKE BECAUSE FIRST. I THE THING THAT YOU THEY DROP OUT OF BASIC BECAUSE OF LOS PROPERTY TAX THAN SUBJECT TO THE FORMULA AND THE FORMULA HELPS THEM. BUT INTEL THAT HAPPENS. GIVEN WHAT YOU JUST SAID. A NON BASIC EIGHT SCHOOL DISTRICT WOULD GET CREDIT FOR. THE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS DOT COM BUT THE BASIC A DISTRICT WARDEN IS THAT CORRECT. FOR THIS IS THAT CHRIS FERGUSON SO BASICALLY DISTRICTS WOULD GET CREDIT TOWARD THOSE STUDENTS THROUGH THE L. T. ABOUT YOUR CORRECT THAT THAT ELSE YEP THAT FOR THOSE JUST REFERRAL TO BE FUNDED WITHIN THEIR EXISTING PROPERTY TAX REVENUES IF THEY REMAINED BASIC. AND TO MADE TO TRANSLATE THAT IT BASICALLY MEANS THEY ABSORB THE COST OF THE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS IN PRE K. THAT IS NOT ABSORBED THE SAME WIFE YOUR NON BASIC A DISTRICT AND IF IT IS ROUGHLY 3% OF THEIR BUDGET. THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT ABSORPTION. S. N. ON NOT. ARE IGNORING THE FACT THEIR BASIC FOR THAT THEY HAVE TAX REVENUES- BOTTOM THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT BUT HAVING SAID THAT WE'RE STILL PUTTING SOMETHING ON THEM WITHOUT GIVING THE MONEY TO DO. AND IN THAT ONE PARTICULAR DISTRICT ARE GONNA DROP OUT A BASIC AGE AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN A WORLD OF HURT THREE AND A HALF YEARS SUBJECT BACK TO DO IT NOW. AND THEN THEY DON'T GET RELIEF ON THAN ROMAN AND TELL D'APPLE PET CANYON POWER. ARE APPOINT CLOSES IT THERE IN A WORLD OF HURT OTHERWISE SO. THE AGENCY TO ME THAT OF THE EXPECTATION IS THE RITUAL AND TAKE CARE OF IT BUT BUT- I THINK LOADING A NEW PROGRAM ON TO THEM AND NOT PAYING FOR SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER IN SOME FORM. R. AND I'M JUST SPEAKING TO ONE THEY'RE ONE AND. THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT. IF THE- ON SCHOOL ON BASE AID IT IS JUST BASICALLY YOU GET THE BASIC CATER FOR PROPERTY TAXES ARE SO HIGH THAT YOUR WEALTHY DISTRICT AND THEREFORE YOU DON'T GET THE AND THEIR DIFFERENT KINDS OF BASIC GRADE SCHOOL DISTRICTS I MEAN. I HAD ONE IN MY SENATE DISTRICT. THAT IS A FARMWORKER COMMUNITY IT IS A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY IT IS A VERY SMALL OVERWHELMING. NUMBER OF FREE AND REDUCED MEALS IN THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT THERE'S A LOCKET INSTALLATION INSIDE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE DISTRICT THAT WAS A HUGE PROPERTY TAX PAYER. AND AS A RESULT. WITH THIS DISTRICT THAT WAS- MAJORITY OF DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS WAS CONSIDERED A BASIC A DISTRICT EVERYBODY NORMALLY WOULD LOOK AT IT IS RICH AND THERE ARE OTHERS THAT JUST BARELY TRIP IN THE BASIC AID AND SO ADDING A THREE PERCENT. WHEN THAT HAPPENS IS NOT A FAIR EXPECTATION AND SO. I WOULD HOPE THAT SOMEBODY WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THIS BECAUSE OUR GOAL IS TO GET THESE PROGRAMS OFF THE GROUND IN A GOOD WAY AND NOT HAVE A FIGHT ABOUT SCHOOL FINANCE SO ANYWAY. POINT MADE LET ME GO TO MY COLLEAGUES. OF WHO. WOULD WANT TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT. R. OKAY THEN START SENATOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THIS IS A VERY SO A PROPOSED- A MY QUESTION THIS PROBABLY PRIMARILY DIRECTED THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- IS WHEN WE LOOK AT THE PRE K. AND PRESCHOOL EXPANSION PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR. I THIS IS ONE TIME FUNDING AND IS IT CORRECT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO YEARS OF FUNDING. I GUESS IS MEANT TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR A TWO YEAR EXPANSION OF T. K. AND A TWO YEAR EXPANSION PRESCHOOL AM I READING THAT CORRECTLY. SO JUST TO CLARIFY THANK YOU KNOW THERE'S A FOUR YEAR PHASE AND OKAY ON THE EXPANSION OF TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND AS THE DATE RANGES OR INCREASE THE FUNDING IT IS BUILT INTO ELSE YEP AB ONE ONGOING BASED- SO THIS IS IT SO HOW MUCH IS IT. THIS IS AN ONGOING EXPENSE FOR THEM. YES OKAY SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING OF THE SIX HUNDRED THIRTY NINE MILLION WHAT IS WHAT IS THAT FOR THAT'S JUST TO HELP EACH. WITH THE EXPANSION. YES THAT IS TRUE. SUPPORT THE INCREMENTAL- EXPANSION IN THE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR. WE BELIEVE THAT OVER THE FOUR YEAR PERIOD THAT AMOUNT. AND THAT REVENGE WILL INCREASE TO A TOTAL OF THREE POINT ROUGHLY THREE BILLION THREE POINT ONE BILLION ON GOING. TO SUPPORT FULL IMPLEMENTATION- IN IN FUTURE YEARS ONCE IT'S FULLY IMPLEMENTED SO I APOLOGIZE IF I MISSED THIS BUT LIKE WHAT IS THE ACTUAL ONGOING COMMITMENT AND YOU KNOW ASSUMING THAT SOUP TO NUTS WHEAT WE'RE SUCCESS WITH THIS EXPANSION IS SIX HUNDRED THIRTY NINE MILLION. THAT IS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR FOR KI K- IS ENOUGH IS THE RIGHT AMOUNT. HOW MUCH ARE WE TALKING ABOUT AN ON GOING BASIS ANNUALIZED. YEAH YOU'RE A- ONCE WE GET THE TWENTY TWENTY FIRST YEAR WHEN THAT THE PROGRAM IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED. WE WOULD EXPECT THE GUARANTEED TO BE REVENGE RABBI ROUGHLY THREE POINT ONE BILLION. TO SUPPORT THE FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF AND UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO A TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN I AM I UNDERSTAND THEY ARE USING THREE POINT ONE BILLION TOTAL FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE OR THREE POINT ONE BILLION JUST FOR THE PRE K. THIRTY K. PIECE. JUST FOR THE G. CARE EXPANSION OKAY SO THREE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OKAY. AND THEN I GUESS THE OBVIOUS QUESTION IS A YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I FAVOUR HE- EXPANSION AND HE CAN UNIVERSAL T. K. IT- YOU KNOW AS SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY HAS A SON IN KINDERGARTEN I KNOW HOW VALUABLE THAT IS AND- HAVING HAD THAT T. K. EXPERIENCE. WAS VERY IMPORTANT FOR HIS DEVELOPMENT. BUT IS THIS SOMETHING WHERE THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT IF THE BUDGET IF I REVENUE START TO DECLINE YOU KNOW AS THEY DO- THAT. WE MIGHT BE SORT OF OVER EXTENDING OURSELVES. THE SEARCH. AT THIS TIME OF OUR MULTI YOUR PROJECTION WE DON'T SEE THAT OCCURRING OKAY- BUT- YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH IF AND WHEN THAT SITUATION WERE TO OCCUR. AND THEN I GUESS IT IS A FOLLOW UP YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT PRESCHOOL EXPANSION. YOU KNOW IDEALLY WE HAVE. UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL IN UNIVERSAL TAKE A BIT YOU KNOW FOR A LOT OF FAMILIES I'VE HEARD THE COMPLAINT THAT. YOU YOU KNOW GET AN EXPANSION OF T. K. BY ITSELF. MAY NOT HELP A LOT OF FAMILIES WHO OFTEN JUST NEED THE- THE COVERAGE OF THEIR CHILDREN THAT THEY NEED THE CHILD CARE- AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT. YOU KNOW. LET'S JUST ASSUME A UNIVERSE IN WHICH WE DON'T HAVE. ENOUGH FUNDS TO COVER BOTH. A UNIVERSAL PRE K. R. KI K. I. AND WE AND ALSO SOMETHING LIKE UNIVERSAL EXPANSION PRESCHOOL ACCESS. I IS THERE A SENSE THAT ONE OF THESE IS GOING TO BE PRIORITIZED OVER THE OTHER- IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE PRIORITIZING KEY K. BUT WHAT. IS THAT. IS THAT CHOICE SOMETHING THAT WAS INTENTIONAL AND I GUESS. THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THAT YOU WOULD. HAVE A RATIONALE FOR WHAT Y. PREFERENCE TKO OVER PRESCHOOL OR VICE VERSA. YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY THAT- FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S PERSPECTIVE WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM- SO WAIT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT YOU KNOW FOR OUR PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT. EXTENDED LEARNING AN OPPORTUNITY PROGRAMS- AS WELL AS OUR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS AND WE DEFINITELY ENCOURAGE DISTRICTS TO YOU. GO AHEAD AND BREAK THOSE PROGRAMS TOGETHER- IN A WAY THAT THAT PROVIDES PARENTS- WITH THE CHOICE. OF FOR THEIR CHILDREN SO THAT THEY THEY CAN BEST CHOOSE THE PROGRAM THAT THEY THINK WILL WORK BEST FOR THEIR SITUATION AND THEIR CHILD. RIGHT NOW I GUESS I GUESS MY QUESTION IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT WHICH IS YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S- LIKE RIGHT NOW WE'RE PLANTING THE SEEDS FOR POTENTIALLY UNIVERSAL T. K. AND UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL. RITE AID AND IF THAT'S A FAIR WAY TO DESCRIBE IT- I END THAT WORKS AS LONG AS WE HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING TO DO THAT BUT SHOULD WE COME TO A POINT WHERE MAYBE. THE FUNDING OUR REVENUES TAKE A DIFFERENT ROUTE NINETY FUNDS TAKE A DIP. AND WE HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE- YOU KNOW DEBBIE'S HAVE YOU THOUGHT THROUGH SORT OF. WHETHER THERE'S A PREFERENCE FOR ONE OR THE OTHER AND WHY. YEAH I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU WITH WITH DETAIL ON WHAT A PREFERENCE MIGHT BE IN THE FUTURE- BECAUSE WE DON'T PREDICT THAT AT THIS TIME- AND CERTAINLY WE WOULD HAVE TO. YOU KNOW ENGAGED THE LEGISLATURE IN YOUR- PERSPECTIVE STOPS IN A CONVERSATION. SHOULD THAT SITUATION OCCURRED. ON IT- LA- DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THIS. I'M A BIG I THINK IF YOU'LL GET INSIDE IS YOUR ARE WITH THE TIMING OF IT MATTERS AND THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS BUT I WOULD SAY THAT- YOU KNOW. WHEN TICKETS IMPLEMENTED T. K. IS JUST PART OF ALTHEA- AND SO IF YOUR GOING TO GET TO THAT POINT I DON'T I THINK. THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD JUST SORT OF SAYING WE'RE NOT GOING TO FUND THESE. THESE CHILDREN ANYMORE WELL ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND A GROUP OF- GREAT EXIST IS UNLIKELY SO NOW I WOULD SAY THAT IF WE DO IN THE IN A RECESSION BUT THE TWO CHOICES THAT YOU HAVE ARE. FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE ARE THEY WERE NOT OING TO PROVIDE WILL OFFER OF THE FF WE'RE GOING TO MAKE REDUCTIONS THAT WOULD BE A- BECAUSE THE MARKETS ON THE SHOULD NOT NECESSARILY FOCUS ON ONE PARTICULAR AREA. WHERE MORE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BUT THESE TWO KIND OF PLACES WHERE YOU HAVE TO GO TO MAKE REDUCTIONS OF MUSTARD. I AS I SAY I TELL YOU WHAT YOU'RE SAYIG IS THAT. THE EXPANSION ANTI K. WILL WILL BASICALLY BAITED AND WILL HAVE NO CHOICE BUT IT'S IT'LL ESSENTIALLY. SHOULD WE HAVE BUDGET ISSUES DOWN THE LINE IT WILL BE A CHOICE BETWEEN TWO K. AND PRESCHOOL IT IT'LL BE A CHOICE BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF CARE- PRETTY K. THROUGH TWELVE EDUCATION BECAUSE OF THE- WHETHER WE PROVIDE PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE. THANK THE END OF VARIOUS THANK YOU AND THEN- A SEPARATE LINE OF QUESTIONING I I'VE I'VE BEEN TOLD THE TRUTH AND I THINK THIS CAME UP EARLIER OP FACILITIES- ARE A BARRIER TO EXPANDING TEAK IN THE SHORT RUN- DOES IT IS THERE ANY THOUGHT PUT TO PERHAPS- ALLOWING AT LEAST AN INTERIM. A DIFFERENT ELEAZAR POTENTIALLY- DEPUTIZE THE EXPANSION EIGHTY K. TO SUB PRESCHOOLS OR OTHERWISE I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF PRIVATE PRESCHOOLS IN MY- IN MY DISTRICT. ARE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE- AT LEAST TEMPORARILY OR SOMETHING LIKE PERHAPS A- I. T. K. PROGRAM IS OVERSEEN BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT- IF THAT'S AN ISSUE IN SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS IS THAT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A POTENTIALLY SOLUTION CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE OUR PROVIDERS TO WORK WITH OUR OUR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO WORK WITH OUR PRESCHOOL PROVIDERS ON THAT SAID THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN THE STANDARDS FOR FACILITIES OR PRIVATE PROVIDER VERSES- DODD AND ELEAZAR FACILITIES FOR EXAMPLE OR RTK FACILITIES ARE GOING TO BE BUILT AT CENTER. I MENTIONED EARLIER- CHIU THE FIELD ACTUALLY ENTERED SO IT YEAH IT'S DEFINITELY A HIGHER CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS- ON OUR TRADITIONAL SCHOOL A CLASSROOM. THANK YOU AND THEN I GUESS MY LAST QUESTION- IN THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR POINT HERE IS AS DIRECTED TO THE PERSON FROM CYPRESS SCHOOL DISTRICT- WELCOME- THANK YOU FOR REPRESENTING ORANGE COUNTY AND I I'VE I'M LOOKING FOR YOUR NAME RIGHT NOW AND IT'S- I'M SORRY MISS TAYLOR- MAYBE I WAS ONE IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO. YOU KNOW SORT OF SOME OF THE CHALLENGES YOU MIGHT SEE IN. BOTH OF THESE PROPOSALS AND- YOU KNOW ANY INSIGHTS YOU MIGHT HAVE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. THANK YOU THIS DANNY TAYLOR. AND YOU KNOW. WITH ALL DUE RESPECT AND I HEARD EVERYTHING AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE- EVERYBODY'S EFFORTS AND SUCH THIS IS A REMARKABLE OPPORTUNITY. WHEN IT COMES TO THE FACILITIES AND HEARING EVERYTHING I SAID I THINK THERE'S- THERE'S NO BATHROOMS I MEAN QUITE FRANKLY. AND YOU KNOW YES WE ARE IN A DECLINING. PARTICULARLY IN MY DISTRICT YOU KNOW- BUT YET BUT THERE ARE THERE ARE NOT THE BATHROOMS THERE'S NOTHING I NEED A LIFE. AND YOU KNOW I THE PREVIOUS KINDERGARTEN AND PRESCHOOL TEACHER YOU KNOW TEACHER YEAH YOU GO TO SIT ON THIS CHAIR THOUGHT THE WHOLE. LONG FALL. BUT YET FOR THOSE LITTLE ONES THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED RIGHT AND SO THOSE ARE THE- BIGGEST CHALLENGES I MET WITH MY DIRECTOR UP MY LAST NIGHT AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST STRUGGLES AS WE'RE LOOKING. HOW ARE WE GOING TO INTEGRATE PARTICULARLY WITH OUR STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. HOW ARE WE GOING TO. MAKE URE WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM. TO ADDRESS. AND THEIR INTEGRATION WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW AM I GOING TO RE WRITE MY CSP PROGRAM. SO THAT WE CAN FULLY INTEGRATE. AND BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S THE RIGHT. THING I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH AND- LOSSING. YOU KNOW. DEAN AND HE TALKED ABOUT- THE DAY. THAT IS BECAUSE- OUT- AND NEEDING AND IN A HEARD FROM D. E. COMMITTEE THAT EGGS- WITHOUT IT WE WOULD HAVE HE WOULD HAVE. OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED WAIVERS HE WOULD HAVE TO RIGHT. BUT THERE ARE SOME UNIQUE NEEDS I'M TO HAVE A SEAMLESS PROGRAM BETWEEN THE TWO YES. HE AND THE SCHOOL AGE PROGRAM- AND SO IF TRYING TO PUT ALL THESE PIECES TOGETHER AS YOU HEARD YOU KNOW ON FEBRUARY SEVENTEENTH THE GUIDANCE WAS PUT OUT. AND SO JUST TO READ THROUGH THATYOU KNOW I SHARED. LITERALLY DURING THE OMICRON YOU KNOW WE WAKE UP TO SERVICES EDUCATOR- OFFICE STAFF WHAT IS IT TODAY. AND WE'RE JUST ALL COMING UP FOR AIR AND TRYING TO READ THROUGH AND GET EVERYTHING YOU KNOW AND THERE'S THE EXPANDED LEARNING PLAN YOU KNOW THAT THE CHANGES TO THE L. SHOP- YOU KNOW I CAN PROP STARK I MEAN I CAN BROUGHT. ALL THESE ACRONYMS. AND DOING ALL THAT SO MAKE SURE WE'RE WE'RE ADDRESSING YOU KNOW THE STAFF. HERE TESTING THE- CHAIR WHO HAS AN ANTI ACRONYM CAMPAIGN. BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THE PLAYOFFS. UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE HAVE GUESTS CONVERSATION. EVERYBODY'S BEEN STARING AT ME IN THE HEARING ROOM WONDERING WHEN I WAS GOING TO SAY SO YEAH. THE LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE WAS NEW THERE WAS A NEW PLAN FOR THAT WE HAVE THE- UNIVERSAL. AND YOU K. WHATEVER THE UNIVERSEPRESCHOOL. GARDEN PLAN YOU KNOW A I JUST TRYING TO UP TO A I GO WITH YOU CHAIR RIGHT THERE YEAH YOU GO. WERE XP LEARN OPPORTUNITIES THE L. LOCAL. WE NEED TO DO ALL THE THESE. IN A VERY FOUGHT PURPOSE MAY. WAY AND CLOVEN ALL TO GET TO THESE ROBOTS PURPOSE AND I KNOW I AND- MR FERGUSON KNOW TALK ABOUT BEING ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS. IN MY LOCAL AREA I'M STILL GRAPPLING TO UNDERSTAND THESE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY SO THAT I CAN HAVE MEANINGFUL CONVERSATIONS AND I DON'T WANT TO TAKE AWAY FROM CD OR MY COUNTY OFFICE THAT HE'S IN COURT TRYING TO PROVIDE ME WITH THE INFORMATION. BUT IN MY LOCAL DISTRICT I'M SMALL YOU KNOW I I'M ONE PERSON WHO'S TRYING TO ATTEND ALL THE ZONES SOMETIMES THEY HAPPEN SIMULTANEOUSLY SO THAT I'M TRYING TO READ THROUGH ALL THE CONTACT. THEY'RE WONDERFUL RESOURCES THERE THEY'RE SUPER SUPPORTIVE THEY RESPOND TO ME. BUT I CAN ONLY DO SO MUCH. HUMANLY POSSIBLE RIGHT NOW MY BIGGEST GOAL IS KEEPING EVERYTHING COPE IT AWAY FROM MY STUDENTS MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE BEING EDUCATED IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE ATMOSPHERE- WHILE TRYING TO MANAGE EVERYTHING THAT'S COMING TO ME AND YOU KNOW LOGISTICALLY AND CONTENT WEISS. AS I MOVE FORWARD JUNE PLAN IS NOT A LOT OF TIME. WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO ENGAGE AND THEN GRAPPLE WITH DO I HAVE BATHROOMS DO I HAVE PLAYSPACE DO I HAVE STAFF YOU KNOW ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

THROUGH TWELVE SAID INCLUDING POTTY TRAINING- YEAH BUT YOU KNOW IT AND LETTERS AND NUMBERS AND SO- I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS AND SO I CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE GOALS OF- YOU KNOW EXPANDING T. K. UNIVERSAL T. K. OF PRESCHOOL- BUT I THINK YOU RAISE SOME IMPORTANT POINTS THAT WE NEED TO GET RIGHT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SENATOR OCHO BOAT. NO QUESTIONS BUT JUST COMMENTS I JUST WHEN I REALLY COMMEND MY COLLEAGUES FOR ASKING REALLY POINTING QUESTIONS AND VERY RELEVANT THAT I ABSOLUTELY CONCUR WITH FIVE WITH BOTH OF YOU SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. BRINGING THOSE FOURTH. THEN LET ME ASK ONE CLOSING QUESTION- BECAUSE- A JENNIFER HICKS THE ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT. ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON THE ISSUE OF A MIX DELIVERY MODEL AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE INTO ANOTHER ITEM IN A MOMENT THAT'S RELATED SO. WE HAVE CHILD CARE PRE K. E. R- TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN WE HAVE A MIX AND- THE REFERENCE WAS MADE TO A MIX DELIVERY MODEL AND SHE ACTUALLY DID THE ON THE GROUND DESCRIPTION OF SOMEBODY WALKING ABOUT ACROSS THE PLAYGROUND FROM ONE TO ANOTHER- HOW ARE WE- SORT OF SUPPORTING THE FLEXIBILITY OF LOCAL DISTRICTS TO DO THE NEXT- DELIVERY MODEL. I MEAN IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WERE JUST FORCING THEM TO FIGURE OUT IS THERE SOMETHING WE'RE DOING ITS INCENTIVES HOWEVER WE TRY TO INTEGRATE THESE TOGETHER AND I DON'T KNOW WHO FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A- STAB AT THE. RIGHT I CAN TAKE THE LEAD ON THAT ONE I THANK GOD CERTAINLY WE PROVIDED SOME ASSISTANCE IN ONE OF OUR LITERACY PROPOSALS AS WELL AS- A YOU KNOW FIFTY MILLION OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION. OF PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE THE TYPE OF BLENDING AND BRAIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND GUIDANCE TO DISTRICTS. I NEED TO OPERATE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS IN YOU KNOW AN INTEGRATED FASHION- TO SERVEAND MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR STUDENTS FOR EXMPLE YOU COULD HAVE A DISTRICT. THAT PROVIDES SIDE YOU KNOW HOW STATE PROGRAM THROUGH THEIR TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN THROUGH TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. UTILIZES CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM CONTRACT TO SUPPORT THE- OF THE OTHER HALF OF THE SCHOOL DAY AND THEN ULTIMATELY LINKS INTO THEIR EXTENDED BURNING OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM TO PROVIDE. YOU KNOW AN EXTENDED DAY OF COVERAGE OF FOR THAT SAME STUDENTS FOR YOU CAN BLEND AND BRAID. THESE MULTIPLE PROGRAMS TOGETHER- USING THAT MAKES DELIVERY SYSTEM WOULD CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE DISTRICTS TO DO THAT AND ARE WORKING WITH THE. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO PRIVATE. TO TRY PROVIDE THAT GUIDANCE CHIU- THE FIELD RIGHT NOW. I'M SURE TO COME. APPROACH WE ALSO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN MENTIONED MANY TIMES THEY'RE STRAPPING ISSUES ARE YOU KNOW PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSALS IS AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE HIGH NEED AREAS IN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM- YOU KNOW TRYING TO CREATE BETTER PIPELINES IN THESE AREAS OF OUR HIGH SCHOOLS. LEADING INTO HIGHER EDUCATION THAT ULTIMATELY LEAD TO. A YOU KNOW HOW COMES AND STAFFING OPPORTUNITIES. FOR OUR STUDENTS- AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND ECONOMIC MOBILITY FOR STUDENTS BUT WE WERE TRYING TO TAKE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO MEET THE NEEDS AND LET ME JUST MAYBE GIVE A CHANCE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION COMMENT ON THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR AND OF A MARKETING DEPARTMENT OF BAD DUDES YOU BUILD UP WITH MR PERSON JUST SHARED. WE ALSO ECEIVED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION IN THIS GREAT YOUR PROJECT FOR EXPANSION OF OUR CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. AND BACK OR IF THEY OR REQUEST FOR FUNDING APPLICATION WAS JUST POSTED YESTERDAY AND FROM THAT WE HOPE TO EXPAND THE NUMBER. A THREE STILL PRESS. BUT AS PART OF THAT. FREE PROGRAM HE'S AND THEN ALSO THE DEPARTMENT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY EMPHASIZED IS THAT MAKES DELIVERY. ALL OF OUR GUIDANCE BUT THE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION TEMPLATE AS WELL AS THAT GUIDANCE THAT WAS RECENTLY RELEASED WE HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION ON. THE PARTNERS IN YOUR SYSTEM WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO BE MIXED THE LIBRARY AND HOW YOU CAN LAYER AND WORK TOGETHER. ACROSS HEAD START STATE PRESCHOOL OTHER PRIVATE PRE K. PROGRAM AND NOT EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. WE ALSO IN THAT PLANNING TEMPLATE CREATED SOME SPACE FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY INCLUDE THAT MAKES DELIVERY AND TO. INTERACT ACROSS THE PLAN THAT THEY HAVE TO DO FOR THE EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAMS. AND VERY FEW KEY K. SO THAT INTEGRATION THAT IS SO CRITICAL AS WE LOOK AT ALL OF THESE HE SAID. REALLY STARTS TO COME TOGETHER IN THEIR PLANS. INTENTIONALLY HELLO I DIDN'T TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OUR WEBINARS. AND THE ACTUAL PLAN. DOCUMENTS AND OUT. K. THANK YOU VERY MUCH N. AS- WEEK GO ON FOR A WHILE BUT HAVE DRILL DOWN ON SOME OF THE MAJOR ISSUES HERE. AND EXPRESSED OUR CONCERNS AND REALLY HOPE THAT AS WE MOVE TOWARDS MAY REVISE THERE'S A FEW OF THESE ISSUES WE MIGHT NEED TO ADDRESS AND JUST LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO DO THAT. LET ME THANK ALL OUR PANELISTS- NOT JUST FROM THE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES BUT AND PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT THAT OFFER THE LOCAL PERSPECTIVE WE REALLY APPRECIATE. YOU HAVING BEEN WITH US TODAY THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL. AND ALL THESE ITEMS FOR THE UNINITIATED OR HELD OPEN SO THAT WE WILL. COME BACK TO THEM. IN THE SPRING WHEN THE REVENUES ARE CLEAR AND SOME ADDITIONAL WORK HAS BEEN DONE ON. WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY CHANGES. OUR PANEL IS EDGAR CABRAL FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE JODI LIEBERMAN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND VIRGINIA EARLY THE EDUCATION MINISTER RIGHT ADMINISTRATOR FOR EARLY EDUCATION DIVISION THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL TAKE THE PANELISTS IN THAT ORDER. AND WILL WELCOME BACK MR CABRAL TO THE COMMITTEE. IN EVERY ROLE AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M I THINK THE WE CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PIZZA BUT- THE GOVERNOR'S- PROPOSAL HERE BUT I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT. BIG PIECES HERE FIRST IS THE REQUIREMENT THAT- DISABILITIES AND STATE PRESCHOOL ARE- BUT OUR 10% OF CHILDREN AND HOLDS THE PRESCHOOL ARE OUR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. I'M THE PROPOSAL ALSO COMES WITH AN ASSOCIATED INCREASE OF FUNDING- FOR SERVING CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. THERE'S ALSO ARE. IN ADDITION PROPOSAL TO OUR FOR WHAT'S CALLED TWENTY FOUR MY ELIGIBILITY IS ONCE A- FAMILY BEEN DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR STATE PRESCHOOL THAT. ARE THEY ARE NOT THEY DON'T NEED TO CONFIRM THAT ALL THE BODY GET OR OR FOR SUBMIT NEW PAPERWORK WITH. WITHIN THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S A PROPOSAL TO- TO ALLOW FREE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS TO SERVE TWO YEAR OLD. I'M I THINK IN OUR OUR OVERALL COMMENTED BIG WITH THAT WE DO THINK- IS. TRYING TO SERVE ADDITIONAL CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES AS THE NORM IMPORTANT GOAL OF THE BIG- I THINK THAT THEY- PROPOSAL MAKES OF MEDWAY. ROAD WOULD BE SOME TO WHAT IS IN THE HEAD START PROGRAM BUT THE FEDERAL. BUT THERE'S LOW INCOME- THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS AND WE THINK THAT. THAT BUT BUT BUT THE GOOD START POINT FOR TO SERVE ADDITIONAL FIVE CHILDREN. OF THE STATE OF THE STORE BLACK COMPARED THE REST OF THE NATION IN TERMS OF. ACCESS REQUESTED PROGRAMS FOR PRESCHOOL AGE KIDS- I'M SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S ONE METRIC THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COLLECTS WHICH IS. A SHARE OF THREE TO FIVE YEAR OLDS WITH DISABILITIES THAT ATTEND A REGULAR EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAM FOR AT LEAST TEN HOURS A WEEK BUT AFTER THE MULTIPLE BUTTONS WE AT LEAST TEN HOURS A WEEK OF. BEING IN A SORT OF MORE FORMAL REGULAR CLASSROOM. IN CALIFORNIA IT'S ONLY 27% OF THREE TO FIVE YEAR OLDS PRESENT IN THIS DODD NATION MORE BROADLY IT'S 56% CALIFORNIA'S MUCH MUCH WORSE THAN THAT AND THEN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY- AND IN THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM ITS OFFICES THE WORK WE HAD RELATIVELY LOW SHARES. UP 4% OF CHILDREN IN IN TWENTY NINETEEN WHAT BOLD WITH WITH DISABILITIES UNTIL WE DO THE TAKING ADDITIONAL ACTIONS MAKE SENSE. I'M WE WILL ALSO NOTE THAT DOES THE EXPANSION OF TRADITIONAL CONVERTIBLE WILL ALSO LIKELY INCREASE ACCESS- TO PROGRAMS WHEN WE TALKED TO. SCHOOL DISTRICTS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS ABOUT HOW WE CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF A FOUR YEAR OLDS. WHO HAVE ACCESS TO A TO A CONCERT PROGRAM ONE OF THE PRIMARY CONCERN THEY MENTIONED WAS. THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO A PROGRAM FROM DISTRICTS DON'T RUN THEIR OWN STATE. PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS FOR SOME SO THEY DON'T HAVE A PLACE- A PROGRAM RUNS. GRADING HE CAME ACROSS THE STATE WILL HELP IN THAT THEIR- SETTINGS HONORABLY. FOR YEAR OLDS. ARE WE DO NOT THAT. WITH THAT THE PERCENT OF. IS A REASONABLE POINT BUT WE DO THINK THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO RE. THE IN A FEW YEARS. GIVEN THE SIGNAL THING ABOUT ARE OCCURRING. IG OF. KINDERGARTEN YOU KNOW ONCE HE CAME. EXPANDED WE WOULD X. IT TO BE A- STAR PROGRAM AT THE PRESCHOOL FOLKS. WHAT WHAT- APPLE LOOKS LIKE IN THE KIND OF THAT IF THAT ARE BIG MAYBE A REASON. REQUIREMENT BE DRIVES THE SHOW CHILDREN DISABILITY THAT IN IN THE PRIEST BELOW THAT YOU WANT TO CONSIDER WAYS TO. THE FROM. TO ADDRESS THOSE. AND SORT OF AND EVERYTHING. THAT WOULD IMPORTANT TO MONITOR ALL THE TIME. I'M WITH TO THE TWENTY FOUR MONTH OLD BELIEVE. WE DIRECTOR ADOPTING PROPOSED- THERE ARE PROVIDERS IN SEVERAL. THAT HAVE BEEN GROW. THROUGH STATUTE WHAT THE BILITY FROM THIRD PARTIES. MANY OF THE TWENTY FIVE ARE ABLE TWENTY FOUR MONTH OLD ABILITY UNDER- FOR. IS THE REPUBLIC. HEALTH INSURER CAN ARE KNOWS. AND ARE. THAT WOULD- WE DO HAVE SOME COST RECOMMENDING CAUTION ON THIS ISSUE AND WE WONDER IF THIS MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO WAIT. FOR A FEW MORE YEARS AFTER SEEING HOW IMPLEMENTATION OF- THESE PROGRAMS OCCURS- DID DEFINITELY WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR PROVIDER WHO MAYBE LIFE HAVING MORE DIFFICULTY WITH SERVING ALL OF THE KIDS ARE. FOR ME OUR OUR YOUR BILL AND ALL SLOTS FIFTY HAVE A LOT OF WILL TO PGA- CRITICAL FOR THOSE WHO ALSO OPERATE AS A- CHOPPER. WHICH IS A TRUCK PROGRAM THAT THE STATE FROM. THAT SERVICE CONSERVE INTO AND TODDLERS. BOTH PROGRAMS MY THIS MY BE BENEFITS FOR THEM.% BUT THERE ARE SOME ADMIN CHAU- IF NOT AS EASY AS A SORT STARTING TO YOUR THEM- FIRST OF THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT. INSTEAD RATIO SO YOU NEED TWICE AS MANY ADULTS. PER CHILD- IN A BRIDGE YEAR OLD AND A FOUR OLD UNDER THE STUDENTS. THIS WOULD REQUIRE PROVIDERS TO GO OUT AND HIRE MORE STAFF RIGHT NOW HAS BEEN IS A CHALLENGE GIVEN SPECTER SHORTAGES. BUT ALSO IN MY TO MODIFY THE FACILITIES ARE. ONCE EXAMPLE IS. AT YOU'RE A TWO YEAR OLDIN THE TO HAVE. A DIAPER TO SPEECH TO DEAL WITH- JIM DIAPERS YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH. FOUR YEAR OLD. AND SO YOU MAY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT FOR YOUR FACILITY ARE LOADED- A MODIFIED TO THEIR PER. NEEDS OF GIVEN THOSE CHANGES WE I THINK THIS MIGHT BE FOR OF A- BY WANT TO DO IN THE FUTURE. ABILITY TO ADD NEW REQUIREMENTS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO INCLUSIVE PRESCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS. THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THAT CHILDREN DISABILITIES HAVE BETTER LONG TERM OUTCOMES WHEN THOSE DISABILITIES ARE IDENTIFIED EARLY AND INTERVENTIONS BEGIN AT A YOUNG AGE. HOWEVER WHILE ABOUT THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS STATEWIDE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED DISABILITY ONLY ABOUT 4% OF STUDENTS AND STATE PRESCHOOL. OUR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. MEANWHILE THE FEDERAL HEAD START PROGRAM REQUIRES ENROLLMENT INCLUDE AT LEAST 10% OF STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. TO INCREASE ACCESS TO INCLUSIVE PRESCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS AND TO ALIGN WITH HEAD START BUT IT REQUIRES STATE PRESCHOOL CONTRACTORS TO MAINTAIN ENROLLMENT OF AT LEAST TO PROVIDE CONTRACTORS WITH THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO SERVE A DISH ADDITIONAL STUDENTS WITH POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT NEEDS. THE BUDGET PROVIDES A HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. A HUNDRED AND TEN POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND TO INCREASE ADJUSTMENT FACTORS FOR THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM TO PROVIDE MORE SUPPORT TO STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. AND DAHLE LANGUAGE LEARNERS. AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED- THE BUDGET PROPOSES SEVERAL CHANGES TO ELIGIBILITY TO EXPAND ACCESS TO STATE PRESCHOOL. FIRST THE BUDGET INCLUDES CATEGORICAL ELIGIBILITY AND STATE PRESCHOOL FOR ALL AGE ELIGIBLE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES REGARDLESS OF INCOME. SECOND ALL STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN STATE PRESCHOOL WILL MAINTAIN CONTINUOUS ELIGIBILITY. FOR TWENTY FOUR MONTHS INSTEAD OF TWELVE MONTHS AFTER ELIGIBILITY IS CONFIRMED. AND FINALLY PROVIDERS THAT HAVE SERVE ALL ELIGIBLE THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS IN OUR SERVICE. WILL BE ALLOWED TO SERVE TWO YEAR OLD CHILDREN. THAT INCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I'M HAPPY TO QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT NOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO VIRGINIA EARLY FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS VIRGINIA EARLY WITH THAT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON BEHALF OF. PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION. SO WE REALLY WANT THE FLAG HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOU IF WE CAN'T DO THAT SB MINISTRATION- WE NEED TO EXCUSE ME TO SAY WE CAN BARELY HEAR YOU AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ON OUR SIDE TO YOUR SIDE SO OFTEN NOW I CAN HEAR MY MIKE WAS TURNED UP SO I THINK YOU'RE OKAY SO WANTED TO KEEP GOING. I CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW YES. MUCH BETTER THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO I HAD VIRGINIA EARLYCALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND THIS BUDGET AROUND BUILDING MACHINE INVESTMENTS FROM MULTILINGUAL LEARNERS AND ENSURING STABILITY FOR CHILDREN ENROLLED IN STATE. FUNDING WE BELIEVE THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT NEED TO IMPROVE AS MR CABRAL MENTIONED IN HIS REMARKS I CALIFORNIA LAGS BEHIND OTHER STATES IN THE NOTING NATION IN TERMS OF PROVIDING SERVICES FOR PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN. WITH DISABILITIES IN THEIR LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THIS MEANS THAT PART THAT PROVIDING SERVICES IN PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF AND SPECIAL DAY CLASSROOMS THAT. ONLY SERVE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. SO I HAS ACTUALLY BEEN DECREASING ITS INCLUSION RATE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WE WERE SERVING 40% OF PRESCHOOLERS IN INCLUSIVE SETTINGS. I WHERE IS NOW AS MR CABRAL MENTIONED IT I'VE JUST UNDER 30% IN THE WIND. AS A PROBE AND BEST FITS IN NEEDS PROVIDE THOSE INCLUSIVE SETTINGS FOR CHILDREN WITH IEPS OR INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PLANS INCREASE WILL CREATES A FOUNDATION OF SUPPORT THAT WILL FOLLOW EACH CHILD INTO ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION. ALSO BENEFITS CHILDREN BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT DISABILITIES. BASED ON THE RESEARCH IF CHILDREN WITH AYE I EAT PEAS ARE NOT SERVICE INCREASED WANT THIS THE STUDYING RESEARCH HAS THAT THEY WILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO ACCESS GENERAL EDUCATION AND TEND TO REMAIN AND SPECIAL DAY CLASSES. RESEARCH ALSO SUPPORTS THOSE BEST PRACTICES I'VE INCREASING THE PROPORTION OF TIME SPENT IN GENERAL EDUCATION SETTINGS ARE STRONG PREDICTORS OF ACADEMIC GROWTH AND IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. SO AS WE LOOK THE BUDGET PROPOSAL STRATEGIES THAT THE OTHERS HAVE SUMMARIZED HIS STRATEGIES WILL REALLY HELP US GET TO A HIGHER INCLUSION RATE IN OUR CALIFORNIA STATE. PROGRAM WE SEE THAT THERE NEARLY SIX THIRTY SIX THOUSAND PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH IRAQIS THAT ARE NOT BEING SERVED IN AN INCLUSIVE SETTINGS. SO GIVEN THIS WE DO EXPECT THAT THE S. P. T. OR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THIS 10% REQUIREMENT. ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE GIVEN TIME AND SUPPORT TO DO SO AS AS IN AS IS THE CASE AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. WE THINK THE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN THE BUDGET BUT IT JUST ACTORS AND WITH A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM. AND THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION PIECES WITH WILL DISCUSS IN THE NEXT I DON'T REALLY GOING TO HELP PROGRAMS WITH MEETING THIS. 10% REQUIREMENTS. ALSO GREAT OF. THAT PROPOSED INVEST. TO INCREASE THEY JUST FACT FOR CHILDREN THAT ARE LANGUAGE LEARNERS. AND THIS WAS THE SOME OF THE NEWER. CONTRACTORS WILL. AROUND HOW WORK WITH. WITH THAT THAT THAT SPEAK MULTIPLE LANGUAGES I PURSUANT TO THE ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTEEN SIXTY THREE THAT WAS SIGNED LAST YEAR ELIGIBILITY WE APPRECIATE THIS ONE SINCE WE KNOW FROM THE RESEARCH THAT HAVING TWO YEARS OF QUALITY EARLY LEARNING BEFORE KINDERGARTEN IS BENEFICIAL AND AS MR CABRAL SAID THIS WILL HELP WITH DECREASING ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN. ENSURE EQUITY ACROSS COUNTIES HAS TWELVE FIFTEEN PAPER. THAT WE ALSO HEAR FROM A THAT THIS MAY HELP WITH PARTNERING. I WERE YOU PEAK OR UNIVERSAL PRE K. SPENT. I SCHOOL DISTRICTS FOR WON'T HAVE TO AS MUCH WORK JUST CHILDREN TO YOUR OLD CHILDREN STATE CRISP WE KNOW THAT UNDER THE PRINT LANGUAGE THERE LAST PRIORITY. AND SINCE AS MISS NUMBER MORE INSIDE A THE LAST PANEL ONLY 13% ELIGIBLE FOR YEAR OLD CHILDREN ARE SERVED WE THINK THAT TODD THREE YEAR OLD CHILDREN MAY BE ENROLLED BEFORE TWO YEAR OLD. HOWEVER WE ALSO NOTE THAT TWO YEAR OLD CHILDREN ARE IN A DIFFERENT DEVELOPMENTAL SPACE OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED THE PIECES AROUND THE DIFFERENT RATIOS WITH A ONE TO FOUR I DON'T CHILD RATIO FOR TWO YEAR OLDS. I WHERE IS WE HAVE A WIND EIGHT ADULT CHILD RATIO WERE ASKED RECENT WORKS SO GIVEN THESE DIFFERENT RATIOS WE'VE HEARD A LOT FROM STATE PRESCHOOL CONTRACTORS. THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENT FACTOR TO SUPPORT THAT PROCESS THAT'S THIRTY NEEDS CHILDREN WITH HIGHER. RATIO THANK YOU SO MUCH HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. YOU HAVE AT THE OF. TIME I'M ALSO PRICE PROFITER THE DIRECTOR OF OUR DIVISION HEATHER CAL. THE DIRECTOR SPECIAL INTERESTS DIVISION IN ADDITION TO THEY'RE NOT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CALL THE IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME FOR QUESTIONS DID NOT AM GOING TO ASK MY CAR. FIRST DEFEAT EITHER ONE OF THEM. HAS QUESTIONS ON. A SENATOR MENDOZA SENT SENATOR JOE BOB GIVE ANY QUESTIONS. SHE DOESN'T SO. THEN LOW ME ASK. IN OUR LET ME PLAY AWFUL FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION- A REPRESENTATIVE JUST SAID AND MAYBE DIRECT THIS TO FINANCE AND WHAT THE WTO COMMENT COMMENT- ON WHY DID. PROPOSES TO EXPAND THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY TO TWO YEAR OLDS WHEN ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF ELIGIBLE THREE YEAR OLDSARE SERVED WOULDN'T IT MAKE SENSE TO PRIORITIZE TO THREE YEAR OLDS BEFORE WE MOVED TO THE TWO YEAR OLDS. BUT CHAIR JERRY BROWN BUT THE CURRENT FINANCE I CAN TAKE A STAB AT THAT QUESTION I WOULD NOTE THAT WE IN OUR PRIORITIES DO YOU HAVE A FOUR YEAR OLD PRIORITIZE BEFORE THREE YEAR OLDS AND THROUGH YOUR ART. THREE YEAR OLD PRIORITIZE BEFORE FOR A TWO YEAR OLDS SO WHAT WE DID IT EXPAND THE ELIGIBILITY TO INCLUDE TWO YEAR OLDS. WE ARE STILL PRIORITIZING FOUR AND THREE YEAR OLDS BEFORE TWO YEAR OLDS. OKAY THE DOES THE L. A- WISH TO. COMMENT HERE. I KNOW YOU ALREADY WAITED A LITTLE ON THIS BUT IT'S LIKE YOU HAVE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ADD. BUT I WOULD JUST SAY I THINK AS OUR- ZERO MENTIONED THIS IS UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL. ACCURATE BED TWO YEAR OLDS FIRST OF ALL I WOULD BE A CHOICE PROVIDERS DO NOT HAVE TO SECURE BUT IT THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER OPTION BUT- IT WOULD BE SORT OF THERE'S A LONG LIST OF PRIORITIZATION. AS YOU MENTIONED GETTING THE QUESTION WOULD BECOME MORE BROADLY RIGHT NOW IT'S A PRESCHOOL IF SPORTING COME ELIGIBLE- THREE YEAR OLDS- ONE POTENTIAL. OPTION AND I THINK ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE JUSTICE. OF THIS WATER COULD BE TO USE A ONE TO OPEN UP THE- FOR BURIAL MORE BROADLY SO THAT OR WE MAKE ALL YEAR OLDS AVAILABLE BY WOULD BE ANOTHER OPTION AS OPPOSED TO THREE THREE TO OLDS BUT THE PROGRAM WHAT IT. WILL BE SERVING THE SAME AGE KIDS SO WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT EASIER TO SERVE AS A BUSINESS OWNER BECOMES A QUESTION OF WHETHER- IN THE LONG RUN IT MAKES SENSE TO SAVE. GIVE ME ACCESS TO OF PRE VERSUS- PROVIDING. A PROVIDING SOME YEAR OLDS AND- OR FAMILIES MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN PROGRAM BOB TOOK TO HAVE A- THANK YOU AND I THINK HOPE OVER THE FEW MONTHS. ALL THE GIVES INTO IN THIS WILL BE COULD. WHEN WE COME BACK AND BE THE- ARE THEY LET ME ASK. WITH REGARD TO THE- OF THE PERCENT FOR SERVINGS WAS. NEEDS BOB JUST TO WEEKS THE TO THIS IS FOR HOW DO WE THE PROGRAM THE- CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL. TO MEET THAT PERCENT REQUIRE IN ORDER TO THAT ARE GOING TO BE IN THE WAY OF THAT THE WE SHOULD BE A- TO HELP THEM MEET THE 10% WE'VE HEARD. ANECDOTALLY FROM THE FIELD AND THAT THE BIGGEST BARRIER TRISTER TO SERVING CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES WAS- JUST THAT THAT COST B. THE AMOUNT THAT THEY WERE RECEIVING TO SERVE THESE STUDENTS WAS NOT COVERING THE COST OF SERVING STUDENTS WITH SIGNIFICANT NEEDS WHICH IS WHY WE INCREASED THE ADJUSTMENT FACTOR FROM ONE POINT FIVE FOUR. TWO TWO POINT FOUR WHICH IS A RATHER SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE- YUP. WE'VE BOTH. I TAKE OVER HERE SO CERTAINLY CHRIS FOR EXAMPLE OF FINANCE SO CERTAINLY- WE ALL THAT WE DO BUT THAT THAT- THIS THE PROPOSAL WE FORWARD IS STRUCK IN A WAY THAT IS ATTEMPTING TO BUILD CAPACITY ATTEMPTING TO GUARANTEED THAT THE ENROLLMENT OF THE ABILITY TO ENROLL STRING WITH DISABILITIES WITHIN THAT 10% IS PRIORITIZED AND AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS- AND- AND AVAILABLE WHEN THOSE STUDENTS BECOME ELIGIBLE OR NEED THAT- THAT FOUGHT. I ANSWER YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT- WE HAVE OPINION PROPOSAL TO HELP OUR CONTRACTORS WITH DEVELOPING INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENTS THE EARLY INCLUSIVE EDUCATE OUR EARLY AT THE INCLUSIVE EARLY EXPANSION OR EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM- R. I. D. E. E. P- I LOVE EVERYBODY STRUGGLING WITHOUT HAVING TO ACTUALLY TRANSLATE. THE ACRONYM SO THANK YOU. YES ARE WE DO AND INVEST THAT WILL TALK ABOUT IN THE NEXT ITEM THAT. SUPPORT FOR SOME OF THE TYPE PASS OF DEVELOPMENT HAS OF- YOU KNOW STUDENTS TO. AND ENVIRONMENT SO WHAT WE THAT YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE BARRIERS ARE RELATED TO THE COST PROVIDING SERVICES- BUT WE CERTAINLY PROVIDE SUPPORT TO DO THAT IN THE OUT YEARS TO BUILD CAPACITY ALSO WE HAVE BUILT THE- STRUCTURE IN A WAY. WHERE YOU A CONTRACTOR IS NOT MEETING THE THEY RECEIVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY WOULD GET TO A POINT WHERE THERE WOULD BE A FISCAL ADJUSTMENT YOUR CONTRACTS OR GOAL. IS TO BUILD CAPACITY OUR GOAL IS TO TRY AND HELP OUR CONTRACTORS GET TO THE REQUIREMENT BUT WE YOU KNOW WE RECOGNIZE THAT IN SOME CASES THERE MAY NEED TO BE SOME LEEWAY IN HOW THEY GET THEIR- AND SOME ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND HOW THEY GET THERE THAT'S BUILT INTO THE COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. BEFORE OKAY IT A APPRECIATE THOSE CA. BECAUSE I THE- THAT I JUST WANNA MAKE EVERY AWARE TO WHAT BARRIER MIGHT BE HOW THEY HAVE TO BE A EVEN THOUGH. YOU'RE DOING YOUR BEST AND WE EVEN HAVE AN ITEM IN THE NEXT ONE THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT YET SENATE ROAD SHOW BUT DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION OR COMMENT ON THIS. A REALLY QUICK QUESTION- I THINK IT GOES HERE- ARE THERE ANY CHALLENGES WITH DIRECTING OR REDIRECTING FUNDING TO NON. ALLEY A PROVIDERS. YES THERE ARE THERE IS SOME CHALLENGE DEPENDING ON THE FUNDING SOURCE BETWEEN DIRECTING MORE RESOURCES TO ELEAZAR OR NON ELLIE- VERY SPECIFICALLY OUR LED- PROVIDERS ARE FUNDED WITH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESOURCES. AND OUR NON ELLIE A PROVIDERS ARE FUNDED WITH GENERAL FUND RESOURCES SO THAT THE DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES DO CREATE SOME CHALLENGES BETWEEN DIRECTING THAT THE FUNDING THAT WE PUT FORWARD. UP TO ONE ENTITY VERSUS THE OTHER. GO AHEAD. JUST AS A FIVE UP SO ARE WE DOING MITIGATE HAVE DONE OUR JOB TRYING APPROACH AS WE DEEPER. A CHEN FUND. IT'S ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND TEN POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND AS WELL AS A HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN POINT- ARE BROADLY HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN MILLION PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE ADJUSTMENT FACTOR INCREASES RECOGNIZING. THAT BOTH OF THE- PROVIDERS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SERVE THE 10% SO WE TRY TO ACCOMMODATE. THE INCREASE ON BULL THE NON L. THE A SIDE OF THE PROGRAM AND THE- NON LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY SIDE OF THE PROGRAM AND LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES FIND OF THE PROGRAM AND WHEN WE GET TO THE NEXT ITEM WE ARE CERTAINLY ENCOURAGING. OUR NON LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY PROVIDERS TO WORK WITH THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THEIR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY PARTNERS TO ACCESS THE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION. PROGRAM FUNDING AS WELL. GIVEN THAT THAT PROGRAM IS PROPOSED TO BE FUNDED WITH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESOURCE. THE SECOND PLEASE YOUR QUESTION. MMHM THEN LET ME MAKE ONE COMMENT BEFORE WE CONCLUDE THIS ITEM IN THAT IS- I. REALLY APPRECIATE AND DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE ELIGIBILITY ORDERED THAT IS LISTED HERE UP IF IT MAKES SENSE WHEN YOU READ IT BUT I JUST. I'M ALWAYS NERVOUS WHEN YOU HAVE SIX DIFFERENT PRIORITIES THAT WERE VERY FINE TUNE IN ASCENDING ORDER OF THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAVING TO FOLLOW THOSE IS BOUND TO HAVE A PROBLEM SOMEWHERE ALONG THE WAY SO UP I'LL BE INTERESTED IF WE IN FACT ADOPT THIS THIS YEAR. TO HAVE A REPORT BACK ON HOW EASY IT IS FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO NAVIGATE ALL THOSE PRIORITIES ARE NOT A SMALL NUMBER OF STUDENTS I KNOW THEIR STUDENTS THAT REALLY WITH THE DATA FIVE NEEDS THAT THAT PUT THEM IN THE CATEGORY BUT- I JUST HAVE THAT. ARE CONCERNED WITH THAT BOM I REALLY APPRECIATE THE PANELISTS ON THAT APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION AND WE WILL MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE WHICH IS SUPPORTING PRESCHOOL AGE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES OUR OUR PANEL IS ONCE AGAIN MR CABRAL FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ONCE AGAIN MISS LIEBERMAN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEN STEVEN PROFITER FROM THE DIRECTOR FOR EARLY EDUCATION- AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WILL GO IN THAT ORDER WELCOME BACK MR. CABRAL DEMOCRATS. LEGISLATIVE OFFICE. BUT- THIS ITEM- NUMBER PROPOSED LETTERS TO. THIS SUPPORT FOR- APRIL PROVIDERS OUT OF ATTEMPTED OF WHICH OF THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE- INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM. BOB THIS IS A PROGRAM WHERE- IT SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE- AS MISTER FERGUSON MENTIONED EARLIER THIS IS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. ONLY THE SCHOOL BASED PROVIDERS- SCHOOL DISTRICT KIND OF THAT IS BECAUSE YOU CAN APPLY FOR THESE FUNDS THE BACON. APPLY FOR BUT AND THEY CAN USE THIS FOR TO- DO ADDITIONAL TRAINING- THE FACILITY UPGRADES OR TO PURCHASE A- TO MAKE THEIR- PROGRAMS MORE INCLUSIVE. OF ALL THE FIVE MILLION FIFTY MILLION IS FOR STATEWIDE TRAINING. AND THAT'S THE WAY TRAINING AS ASSEMBLY THE FUNDING WOULD GO TO- AND I WE LOCAL EDUCATION IT AGENCIES SO. RIGHT I GRANT COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION BY TURNING. R. SEVEN A LETTER THAT TRAINING YOUR HAVE- SEE A COMMUNITY BASE OR- BENEFIT FROM THAT TRAINING THE JUST CAN'T GET THE DIRECTLY TO. DO THE TRAINING UPGRADE INSULTS. ON THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL. TWO MILLION DOLLARS THAT THE SO WITH- IMPROVING EARLY I DON'T SO MILLION IS FOR THE PART OF EDUCATION TO DEVELOP A TOOLS FOR OUR- CHILDREN RISK FOR DRUG DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS ARE RUNNING. AND IN SIXTEEN OF- POSSIBLY PROVIDED- TRAINING AND SUPPORT THE PROVIDERS. I THINK THIS IS WHAT AREAS WE DID THAT- AS WOMEN EARLIER THAT BAD THE GUY. WAS WORTH PER. WE DO HAVE COME WITH ENSURING THAT THERE A MISSED IS SUFFICIENT SUPPORT FOR PROVIDERS AND PREDICT FOR THOSE OUR COMMUNITY BASED ON. THA NON INSTEAD OF NOT ONLY ALL NOT MONTHS PROVIDER BUT OUR COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS- SO WOMEN'S A BIGGER MORE BROAD- IN THE STATE PRESCHOOL. 4% CHILDREN UNTIL JUST. IF YOU DON'T AT THAT BY THE TYPE OF. IT'S THERE ISN'T A SIGNIFICANT OF. THE FOR THE SCHOOL BAY FORTY POINT PERCENT OF THEIR CHIU- IT'S A PRESCHOOL ARGYL DISABILITY FOR COMMUNITIES OF THIS IS THAT THE ONLY TWO NINE PER. THEY HAVE A LOWER. ENROLLMENT OR- I'M ALSO. SCHOOL BASED PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT MORE TO PASS. ON IT PART BECAUSE OUR SCHOOL THIS HAVE A SPECIAL EDUCATION TO THEY ARE RESPOND FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES. FOR THE ARE THREE AND FOUR YEAR SO BUT FIND IT EASIER THAN ARBOR STUDENTS TO THE PRIEST PROGRAM INITIAL DISCORDANT. BETWEEN OF IT'S GOOD EXPERT AND WITH A STATE PRESCRIBER. COUNTY OPPOSITE SIMILARLY THE SPECIAL. EXPO ON ADVOCATE HELP WITH. IMPLEMENTING THE ISSUES. PRODUCT MAYBE SORT OF IN THE HAVE THIS OF COMPOUND CHRIS PROGRAMS SUPPORT SORRY HAVE START FROM WHICH HAVE. A REQUIREMENT TO SERVE OUR MORE JUNIOR DISABILITY BUT MANY THEM DO NOT. UNTIL THEY MAY NOT HAVE THAT SAME- ACCESS TO SPECIAL EDUCATION EXPERTS. FOR THE STATE LEVEL SYSTEMS THAT- BUT THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS CAN ALSO ACCESS- THERE ALSO MAY BE OTHER WAYS THAT THE THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER FINDING OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDING. FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW THERE IS A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION AND FEDERAL FOR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT FUNDS THAT ARE. ADMINISTERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES NOW WITH THE TRANSITION OF. HEALTH CARE TO DISCUSS. BY FUNDING IS DEPICTED STARTED WRITING ACTIVITIES BUT SOME OF THAT FUNDING COULD POTENTIALLY BE REDIRECTED TO BE. USED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT- SIMILAR THE WITH THE LETTER MARIJUANA THAT GREATER FOR OF THAT SIXTY. THAT'S I DO. OF THIRTY SOMETHING AMOUNT OF FIVE OR SOME OF. SIR THAT. A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION HAVE ACT TO. AS WITH. THE BURDEN THE OF ABOUT I WOULD MOST BENEFIT FROM THE SUPPORT. BUT MY REMARKS BEEN OBSERVED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HELLO AGAIN JODY WE OF THE FIND I'LL BE COMING FOR. TO EXPAND THAT DIDN'T EARLY AND EXPANSION PROGRAM AND THE PROPOSAL FOR EDUCATOR TRAINING ON PRESCHOOL ASSESSMENT TOOLS. AS YOU MAY RECALL THE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM WAS PASSED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AS A PART OF THE EDUCATION OMNIBUS BILL. AND THE PROGRAM IS A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM FOR ALLOCATION TO LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO INCREASE ACCESS TO INCLUSIVE EARLY LEARNING AND CARE PROGRAMS FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. FUNDS MAY BE USED FOR FACILITIES ADOPTING A QUICK MAN AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THAT INCLUSIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS ARE BENEFICIAL TO THESOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND ACADEMIC DEVELOPMENT OF NOT ONLY STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES BUT ALSO GENERAL EDUCATION STUDENTS. THE BUDGET INCLUDES FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM SUPPORT GENERAL EDUCATION AND SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS IN INCLUSVE CLASSROOMS. OF THESE FUNDS THE SUPERINTENDENT ALLOCATE UP TO FIFTY MILLION TO WORK WITH A LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES SUCH AS THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION TO PROVIDE STATEWIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND SUPPORT EFFORTS TO OFFER. A LINE EARLY EDUCATION PROGRAMS. THE SECOND REVERSAL IS AIMED AT IDENTIFYING CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES EARLY AND STARTING INTERVENTIONS A YOUNG AGE AS PRESCHOOL AND TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN OR EXPANDED WE SHOULD FOR THE REFINED DIAGNOSTIC THE DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT TOOLS USED FOR EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF STUDENTS WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES. AND ENSURE THAT TEACHERS RECEIVE THE TRAINING TO OFFICIALLY USE THOSE TOOLS AND- I KNOW WHAT THIS THE BUDGET INCLUDES TWO MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO INCORPORATE EARLY IDENTIFICATION FOR LEARNING DISABILITIES. INTO THE DESIRED RESULTS DEVELOPMENTAL PROFILE INCLUDING A PROCESS FOR FOLLOW UP BY EXTRA VALUE WAITERS AND SIXTY MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO PROVIDE TRAINING FOR THE EDUCATORS ON EFFECTIVE USE OF THESE TOOLS. THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WILL. MOVE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN BURSTS EVEN BROADER FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TWENTY FOUR. CT APPRECIATES THE PROPOSED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM. WHICH FUNDS INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT SERVING BOTH CHILDREN IN GENERAL EDUCATION AND SPECIAL EDUCATION IN INCLUSIVE CLASSROOMS. WE KNOW THIS INVESTMENT IS MUCH NEEDED ESPECIALLY WITH THE NEW REQUIREMENTS 410% OF CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM CONTRACTORS. FUNDED ENROLLMENT. TO BE CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. DURING THE INITIAL REQUEST FOR APPLICATIONS FOR THIS PROGRAM THE C. E. RECEIVED REQUESTS IN EXCESS OF THREE HUNDRED FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. FAR EXCEEDING THE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY SIX BILLION IN FUNDING THAT WAS AVAILABLE FOR THAT ALLOCATION. ANECDOTALLY OTHER ELEAZAR INTERESTED IN APPLYING BUT DID NOT FOR VARIOUS REASONS. TO SENATOR OF TROUBLES ON THE PREVIOUS ISSUE AND MR BERLE'S COMMENTS EARLIER WE ALSO KNOW THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE STATE PRESCHOOL HAVE SHARED WITH US THAT THEY WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM SUPPORT PROVIDED THROUGH THIS PROGRAM. SO WE WILL ALIGN WITH THE L. A- IN. ASKING FOR FUNDS TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. HOW WE THERE WILL BE HIGH DEMAND FOR LED. FOR THE FIVE AND FIVE MILLION SO WE WOULD REQUEST THAT ADDITIONAL FUNDS BE APPROPRIATED TO MEET THE STATE. WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE ON WHAT FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS. WHICH WOULD MEET THE NEED HERE. ONE LESSON THAT CD LEARN FROM THE INITIAL ROUND OF THIS GRANT WAS THE NEED FOR STATE AND REGIONAL LEVEL SYSTEMS SYSTEMS BUILDING. AND SUPPORT FOR THE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM FUNDS- SO THEY ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE- AS A RESULT WE ARE WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE FIFTY MILLION SET ASIDE TO ADDRESS STATE LEVEL SYSTEMS BUILDING. IN A LINE LOCAL PRACTICE WITH THE RESEARCH AND PRACTICE BASED STRATEGIES THAT BEST PROMOTE. STUDENT OUTCOMES AND PROGRAM QUALITY. IN ORDER TO HELP THESE PROGRAMS RUN SMOOTHLY THERE NEEDS TO BE PROPER PREPARATION AND SYSTEMS PUT IN PLACE TO SUPPORT THEM. THE CITY HAS TAKEN NOTED THESE AND RESOURCES PROVIDED WILL ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE SUPPORTED BY PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. PRACTICE BASED COACHING IN JOB EMBEDDED PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT- TO FOR GRANTEES AS NECESSARY AROUND INCLUSION SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING OF CHILDREN. AND STRATEGIES TO LEVERAGE ALL AVAILABLE FUNDING FOR INCLUSIVE. ENVIRONMENTS IN EARLY EDUCATION. THIS E. O. APPRECIATES INVEST FOR EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF LEARNING DISABILITIES. EARLY DETECTION IS A PRO. ACTIONS AND NOT A WAIT TO FAIL MODEL EARLY IDENTIFICATION PROCESS OFTENTIMES CAN PREVENT A REFERRAL SPECIALIST OCCASION BY INTENSELY ADDRESSING NEEDS AT EARLY AGE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT STUDENTS ARE NOT IDENTIFIED EARLY IN SCHOOL AGE YEARS OFTENTIMES ARE REFERRED TO SPECIAL EDUCATION IN LATER GRADES AFTER A SIZEABLE GAP AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND PERFORMANCE HAS SURFACED. EARLY INTERVENTION IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF COST AND HEALTH THEN LATER MEDIATION FOR EXAMPLE PARTICIPATION IN HIGH QUALITY PRE K. THESE TWO SYSTEM STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS TO SPECIAL EDUCATION THIS. WELL CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTS THE CALIBRATION TOOL FOR DESIRED RESULTS DEVELOPMENT PROFILE WE DO NOT INCLUDE USE THAT EARLY IDENTIFICATION IDENTIFICATION TOOL IN OUR STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS THE VOTE ALWAYS HAVE THAT ON OUR WISH LIST. INCLUDING IT WOULD ALIGN STATE PRESCHOOL AND HEAD START AND WITH OUR QUALITY COUNTS CALIFORNIA OR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM. THERE ARE MULTIPLE TYPES OF LEARNING DISABILITIES THAT EXIST THAT CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AND HOW THEY AFFECT THE CHILD'S ABILITY TO LEARN. ALIGNMENT WITH THE RESEARCH AND USING THESE RESOURCES THE CITY WOULD ENGAGE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD TO REVIEW CURRENT TOOLS AND DEVELOPING EARLY IDENTIFICATION CHECKLIST TO WORK TO ASSIST IN IDENTIFYING LEARNING DISABILITIES. TO REMEDIATE AND EARLY EDUCATION AND FOR MEDIATION IS NOT IMPROVING THE CHILD'S ABILITY CONSIDERATION TO REFER TO SPECIAL EDUCATION FOR AN EVALUATION. AS PART OF OUR WORK ON THIS WE WOULD BE PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN A TOOL THAT IS LOW TO NO COST. WE ALSO GREATLY APPRECIATE THE RECOGNITION IN THE BUDGET THE CREATING THE TOOLS NOT ENOUGH THAT RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO TRAIN AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AND TRAINING AROUND IMPLEMENTING THE TOOL AND USING THE INFORMATION FOR REFERRALS INFORMATION TO FAMILIES AND BEST SUPPORTING INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN'S NEEDS.

I DON'T HAVE QUESTIONS FROM COLLEAGUES SO LET ME ASK ONE MYSELF. IN. HE'S MAKES I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS THE BEST PLACE TO START BUT I WAS WONDERING TO SPECIAL EDUCATION LOCAL PLAN AREAS OR SELF OF THE SYSTEMS- OF WHAT IF ANY ORDER THOUGH THEIR ROLES- IN THIS OF JUST BECAUSE- WE CONSIDERED THEM AND CERTAIN ISSUES IN A PREVIOUS HEARING I JUST LIKE TO KNOW HOW THEY FIT IN THIS RECOMMENDATION AND MAYBE START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THIS IS CHRIS FERGUSON WILL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO I THINK YOU KNOW IN REGARDS TO SPECIAL EDUCATION WE THINK THAT THE SPECIAL EDUCATION RESOURCE. ARE LEADS TO NOT HAVE AN ACTIVE ARE DEFINED ROLE IN IN PROVIDING SUPPORT TO PRESCHOOL LEVEL NOR ARE THEY INTENDED TO HAVE A ROLE IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA OF WORK HOWEVER- THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACTED TO INCLUDE FIFTEEN MILLION ONE TIME PROP NINETY EIGHT.

THESE GOALS ARE I CONTINUE TO BE AREAS OF FOCUS AS WE LOOK TO ENHANCE THE STATE'S PRESCHOOL ASSESSMENT TOOLS AS A WAY TO PROMOTE STUDENT OUTCOMES AND STRENGTHEN NOT. PROGRAM QUALITY. THANK YOU DOES THE- LEGISLATIVE OR THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION HAVE COMMENT EITHER ONE BEFORE WE MOVE ON. THEY'RE BOTH CHECK FOR THOSE OF YOU AT HOME THEY BOTH SHOOK THEIR HEADS. UP SO- I THINK THAT COMPLETES OUR QUESTIONS BUT I WOULD MAKE MONEY ONE COMMENT BECAUSE I KNOW THE REPRESENTATIVE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. MADE A POINT OF REQUEST FOR MORE MONEY AND WE HAVE SO MUCH THAT'S ON THE TABLE HERE THAT WE WERE DISCUSSING THAT JUST IT WOULD COMPETE WITH EVERYTHING ELSE SO FAR. WITH THAT. THAT COMPLETES OUR HEARING OF THE THREE ISSUES AND WE START PUBLIC COMMENT BUT BEFORE WE MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT. I BELIEVE SENATOR MEN WANTED TO MAKE A STATEMENT. YEAH I JUST WANT TO SAY- AS WE GO THROUGH SOME OF THESE DIFFERENT. K. THROUGH TWELVE AND PRE K. T. K. PRESCHOOL PRIORITIES. I WANNA MAKE SURE WE DON'T LOSE THE FOREST FOR THE TREES- I SUPPORT A LOT OF THE PROGRAMS THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD A GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS A PROPOSED- AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WE KNOW WHAT A HIGH LEVEL- THAT OUR SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA BASIC INSTRUCTION CAN BE IMPROVED THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT THERE- AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT. THE TWO FACTORS THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT IN EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES OUR CLASSROOMS SIZE AND TEACHER QUALITY- AND I WILL SAY THAT I AM SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED TO SEE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET REALART HAS NOT ADDRESS THIS MORE HEAD ON. I AND IN A TIME WHEN WE DO HAVE BOUNTIFUL RESOURCES I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS ISSUES LIKE EQUITY ANTI K. AND ANYTHING THE GOVERNMENT A GOVERNOR IS ADDRESSING- BUT WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE SHORT UP AND NOW IS THE TIME WE REALLY SHOULD BE PRIORITIZING THAT. SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE EMPHASIS PUT JUST ON INCREASING THE SHARE OF DIVINITY LCF AFTER SCHOOL SO THAT WE CAN GET TO THE HARD WORK OF REDUCING CLASS SIZES IMPROVING TEACHER QUALITY I JUST MAKING SURE WE HAVE GOOD TEACHER RETENTION- AND SO I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US EMPHASIZE GOING FORWARD.
