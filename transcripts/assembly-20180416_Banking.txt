GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE. WE ARE GOING TO THAT. STARTS AT THE COMMITTEE HAD AS A SUBCOMMITTEE AS OTHER MEMBERS AT COME IN I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF COMMITTEES HAPPENING AT THIS MOMENT. AND SO WHEN WE HAVE OTHER MEMBERS COME AND WE WILL ADD. CALL FOR A QUORUM. AYE I DO SEE. THAT WE HAVE THE. MISTER JONES SAWYER HERE AT TO PRESENT A BILL. FOR S.. THIS IS AB TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY FIVE I'M ALL THAT IS A CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION WE HAVE OVER FIFTY YEARS OF. WORKING IN THE AREAS OF POLICY LITIGATION AND COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND WORKING ON ISSUES THAT AFFECT LATINOS AND THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS AND. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD BELL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MENTIONED IT IS JUST CLOSING AN EXISTING LOOPHOLE WE DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT THESE TYPES OF DADS ARE DEBTS THAT SHOULD BE PROTECTED UNDER THE ROSENTHAL. FOR DATA COLLECTION ACT AND I'M JUST TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL PROVIDES. AS STATED IS CRITICAL PROTECTIONS TO EXPOSE COMMUNITIES SUCH AS LOW INCOME% COMMUNITIES COMMITTEES OF COLOR. ON IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AND THE ELDERLY BY EXTENDING THESE PROTECTIONS ON WITHOUT REALLY CHANGING THE COLLECTION PRACTICES FOR THE STATS ARISING FROM CONSUMER TRENDS ACT OUT CONSUMER TRANSACTIONS. ON THEIR FRONT STATED. THIS MERELY JUST CLOSES A LOOPHOLE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK. WITH THE COMMITTEE AS AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD THINK YOU ENTER DRIVE YOUR I'VE. I HATE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES AND SUPPORTS. I ENGRAM ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. SEE NO OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME UP. GOOD AFTERNOON AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAVID REID I'M TRACTOR GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS OF FOR THE RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION. OTHER SINGLES MANAGEMENT CESSATIONS A NONPROFIT TRADE ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS THE INTERESTS OF MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED BUSINESSES. WITH THOUGHT WITHIN THE RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY INCLUDING THE CREDITORS THIRD PARTY COLLECTION AGENCIES COLLECTION LAW FIRMS AND DEBT BUYING COMPANIES. OTHER RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY FIVE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER JOINS JONES SAWYER AS THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED BUT I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT. WE ARE WONDER PERCENT SUPPORT THE CONCEPT THAT'S BEEN PUT FORWARD HERE. OF ITS. AND WITH THAT WITH SOME WHAT I WOULD CALL MODEST AMENDMENTS. THAT WILL NOT MAKE A SUBSTANTIVE IMPACT ON THE BILL WOULD OF BE PROUD TO ISSUE A MEMO SUPPORT ON THE BILL. OF THE BILL AS DRAFTED. WOULD HAVE MEANT TO SEPARATE ACTS THOUGH ROSENTHAL FAIR DEBT PAPA COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT AND THE OF THE FAIR DEBT BUYING PRACTICES ACT. BY ADDING NON CONSENSUAL OBLIGATIONS TO PAY. TO THE SCOPE OF BOTH ACTS. ARMY SUPPORTS THE DIVISION OF NON CONSENSUAL OBLIGATIONS THE PAY TO THE ROSENTHAL ACT. BUT OPPOSES ITS ADDITION TO THE FAIR DEBT BUYING PRACTICES ACT OF THE REASONS WHY ARMY OPPOSES ITS ADDITION TO THE FED UP BY AND PRACTICES ACT ARE ARE UP FORTY FOUR POINTS. THE FIRST THAT. THE FED AT PRATT ART COLLECTION THE FAIR DEBT BUYING PRACTICES ACT IS LARGELY BASED ON CREDIT CARD DEBT AND THE TERMS TO USE THROUGHOUT THE ACT. ARE FOCUSED ON THE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS ASSET CLASS MOST OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE FAIR DEBT BY AND PRACTICES ACT IS CONDITIONED ON THE THE CONCEPT OF CHARGE OFF. WHICH IS A DEFINED TERM IN FEDERAL LAW IN THE FEDERAL BANKING A BANKING CODES. CHARGE OFF IS A TERM FOR TWENTY TIED TO A WITH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES USED BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. ARMY IS UNAWARE OF ANY INSTANCE WHERE NON CONSENSUAL OBLIGATIONS TO PAY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CHARGE OFF. BY ADDING THIS TERM TWO SECTIONS OF LAW THAT ARE CONDITIONED ON CHARGE OFF WILL LIKELY MAKE THESE LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ON COLLECTIBLE. ARE THE SECOND POINT IS THAT THE FAIR DEBT BUYING PRACTICES THAT REQUIRES A COPY OF THE CONTRACTOR OTHER DOCUMENT EVIDENCING THE DEBTORS AGREEMENT. TO THE DEBT WHICH DOES NOT EXIST WITH NON CONSENSUAL OBLIGATIONS TO PAY AS IT RELATES TO LANES AND PENALTIES DESCRIBED IN THE BILL'S DEFINITION. OF THE OF THAT TERM IT WOULD BE A LEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY FOR BUSINESSES TO COMPLY WITH THIS PROVISION OF LAW AS IT'S DRAFTED. THIRD POINT IS THAT THE FAIR DEBT BUYING PRACTICES ACT REQUIRES THE CONSUMER NOTICED TO BE PROVIDE TO CONSUMERS OF CREDIT CARD DEBT. BY ADDING NON CONSENSUAL OBLIGATIONS TO PAY OUT TO THE REQUIRED NOTICE. WOULD ONLY SERVE TO CONFUSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WILL RECEIVE THE NOTICE ON CREDIT CARD DEBT. AND THEREBY OPEN UP. THESE BUSINESSES TO LIABILITY UNDER BOTH THE ROSENTHAL ACT AND THE FEDERAL FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES ACT. AND THEN FINALLY. ADDING NON CONSENSUAL OBLIGATIONS TO PAY TO THE FED UP BY PRACTICES SERVES NO PURPOSE BECAUSE EVERY BUSINESS THAT IS SUBJECT TO THE FAIR DEBT BUYING PRACTICES ACT. IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE ROSENTHAL ACT. L.. SO THE MERE ACT OF THE MERE FACT OF THE MANY IN THE ROSE AND FELL ACT WHICH ARMY SPORTS WOULD AUTOMATICALLY BRING IN ALL OF THOSE BUSINESSES THAT I ALSO HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE FAIR DEBT BUYING PRACTICES ACT. BUT WITHOUT TRYING TO. AMEND THE PROVISIONS OF THE FED UP BY PRINT OR A PRACTICES ACT WHICHAGAIN ARE GEARED TOWARDS FINANCIAL. OF BECAUSE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF ARMY WOULD OF LOVED TO WORK WITH THE SPONSOR. AND THE AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE. AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD WE DON'T INTEND TO OR WANT TO BE AN IMPEDIMENT TO THIS BILL'S PASSAGE AGAIN WE SUPPORT THE CONCEPT. OF WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT ALSO DOESN'T CREATE ANY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION. MEMBERS ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. HAVE AUTHORITY BY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BY OUR SEWER. SUPPORT YOUR ORIGINAL ACT CONCEPT OF BEHIND DISPIRITO LA. BUT BY HAS SOME. DEFINITIONAL LA. NO QUESTIONS SO HERE NON CONSENSUAL. DATA. NOT INCLUDE SECURE RESIDENTIAL RAN TO WALK CREDIT CARD. OF THOSE ARE THE ONES SOME WHEN YOU SIGN UP BAR YOU HAVE AGREED TO. THAT THE YOU SHALL PAY. ARE YOUR MONTHLY. ABOUT RENT A WALK CREDIT CARD. WELL IT IS IN THAT THAT. YOU KNOW. THE YOU YO CONSENT WITHOUT POWER REQUIREMENT ORIGINALLY. IF THE SO ONE SIDED THAT THAT'S A NON CONSENSUAL. SO UNDER KNOW HOW YOU CAN. COMBINED THE MORE TOGETHER. SO YOU THINK YOU'VE. I CHOI BABA RECEIVED THEIR OBJECTIONS ON ON FRIDAY NIGHT. AND I AND I AGREE WITH ARE IN MAY THAT WE'LL. AS WE IF IF WE GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AS WE GO THROUGH JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. WHICH I THINK WILL REALLY FOCUS IN ON THAT THAT THE DEFINITION OF WHAT. LIKE A LASER THAT WILL BE ABLE TO WORK OUT SOMETHING THAT WOULD NOW BE AMENABLE TO OUR IN MAY. BUT WILL NOT TOUCH A UTILITY WRITTEN INTACT BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IN IN THIS BILL. ARM UP I HAVE SEVERAL IDEAS THAT I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD. HASHEM OUT RIGHT NOW. BUT. I THINK WE CAN COME UP WITH SOME COMPROMISE. OKAY ARE A I WOULD TOTALLY AGREE THAT THERE ARE THERE HAS TO BE SOME FAILURE WAY OF COLLECTING THAT THAT'S. A LINE OF SCHOOL REAL SO WAY OF UP COLLECTING DEBTS SUCH AS UNFAIR. A BECAUSE OF YOU US STATED THE HAIR. AROUND IT IT UP PAYING THAT THAT THE. WHAT THE PROVIDING? THE FOOL DOT FROM THE TABLE AMEND. WHICH WHICH IT HAS A VERY VERY ESSENTIAL AND. NECESSARY NECESSARY THERE HAS TO BE SOME WAY SO WE CAN HELP THE MOUTH ABOUT ON THE OTHER HAND. IF WE ARE. OVER REGULATE TELL OR OR OVAL PROTECT THE CONSUMER SECTOR AND THE. ONE INTENDED UP CONSEQUENCES. UP. MAY BE IT A BIT HARDER. TO OUR RENTAL PLACE. I HAD TO LEAVE OUR. BECAUSE OF THEY WERE THEY WERE TO A FATHER AND SCRUTINIZES ASIAN WHETHER THE PERSON. WOULD HAVE A HIGHER. CREDIT RATING WHAT ABILITY TO TO PAY THE RENT. ETCETERA ETCETERA SO EVENTUALLY THEY MAY BECOME. OF THE VICTIM LATER ALL. SO ARE. IT IS SO WELL INTENDED HOWEVER THERE MAY BE SOME. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES TO WHEN. A. THE SOMEBODY HAS TO PAY. IT PAID FOR. L. ONE SITE. IN. THE RENTER DOES NOT. PAY THE PROJECTED INCOME. AND AND. DOT LAW PROHIBITS. FAVORITES VENTURED COLLECTING THE DATA AND THEN ALSO WOULD HAVE WHAT IS SO. VIA. A STATUE OF LIMITATIONS AND DAN OVERALL PRICES LATER ON THEY HAVE TO CHARGE BACK MORE TO THAT. SO WHAT ARE WHETHER YOU HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THE ONE THAT THERE. I. UNINTENDED NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES AS WELL. SO AGAIN DOCTOR CHOI I HEAR ALL YOUR CONCERNS AND NOT WILL WORK WITH THE THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL TO ENSURE NOT ONLY THEM BUT I I BELIEVE. ON THE SOME OTHER INDIVIDUALS THAT I'VE TALKED TO ABOUT. ON UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT WE DON'T. WE DON'T TRIGGER THAT THIS IS REALLY SHOULD BE NARROWLY FOCUS. TWO UNSCRUPULOUS ARM LENDERS. AND. I WOULD NECESSARILY PUT OUR INMATE IN THAT CATEGORY WHO WILL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN NOT THE PREDOMINANT CATEGORY. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. WE DON'T YET HAVE QUORUM WE WERE SO CLOSE TO HAVING QUORUM. AND THE AND SO WHEN WE DO AND WE WILL. TAKE A VOTE ON THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION. NEXT WE HAVE A ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK. WITH AB SEVENTEEN FORTY TWO. CHAIR OF THE MONNIN MEMBERS. I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF WORKING CLOSELY WITH MY STAFF ON THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP. AB A SEVENTEEN FORTY TWO MAKES IT EASIER FOR CALIFORNIANS TO FREEZE THEIR CREDIT HISTORY. TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FROM THEFT AND FRAUD. EVERY YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS STOLEN FROM MILLIONS OF AMERICANS IN DATA BREACHES IT'S HAPPENED TO ME SEVERAL TIMES. LAST YEAR'S EQUIFAX ATTACK WAS. ON ONE OF THE THREE CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES. IT PUT OVER A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE AM. MILLION AMERICANS INCLUDING ME. AT RISK FOR IDENTITY THEFT. CALIFORNIA'S CAN PROTECT THEMSELVES WITH CREDIT FREEZES. IT CAN PREVENT CRIMINAL FROM OPENED UP FRAUDULENT CREDIT LINES. THE FREEZE PROCESS HOWEVER IS COMPLICATED AN ARCANE. AB SEVENTEEN FORTY TWO WOULD PROTECT CALIFORNIANS BY ALLOWING THEM TO PLACE ONE CALL. I MAKE ONE A LOT ELECTRONIC REQUEST DEFEAT FREEZE THEIR CREDIT AND ALL CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY SOMETHING. I'VE DONE MYSELF. UP THE SAME SIMPLE PROCESS WOULD APPLY TO TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT UNFREEZE. WITH ME TODAY. I THOUGHT. UP THERE I. HA WITH ME TODAY IS TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA. DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS TIFFANY MATTHEW SOME HALF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN FORTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK. DATA BREACHES ARE BECOMING A COMMON OCCURRENCE TECHNOLOGY HAS MADE IT EASIER FOR HACKERS TO ACCESS PERSONAL INFORMATION AND STILL THE IDENTITIES OF CONSUMERS AROUND THE WORLD. IDENTITY THEFT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM IN THIS BILL WOULD BE HELPFUL TO A CONSUMER FACING POTENTIAL IDENTITY THEFT BY MAKING IT EASIER FOR THEM TO FREEZE THEIR CREDIT AND PREVENT FRAUDULENT CREDIT LINES. FROM OPENING WE URGE AYE VOTE. I THINK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SUSAN MARTIN WITH CONSUMERS UNION WHEELS THINKS IS VERY COMMON SENSE YOU CAN ALREADY DO. ONE ONE REQUEST ALL THREE BUREAUS FOR NINETY DEFRAUDED SO DOING IT FOR A SECURITY FREEZE MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN THE WORLD AND WE SHOULD ALL BE PROTECTING OURSELVES IN LIGHT OF THE EQUIFAX DATA BREACH. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS. SUMMIT MEMBER AND RICKY AND RESPECTIVELY ASPIRIN AYE BUT. YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE RAINY POLLOCK ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER GET INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS OVER ONE HUNDRED CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING THE NATIONAL ONES EXPERIAN EQUIFAX AND TRANSUNION. WE SUPPORT PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL THAT CONSUMERS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PLACE A SECURITY FREEZE ELECTRONICALLY. WE ALSO SUPPORT ELIMINATION OF ANY FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE FREEZES. WE ALSO SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF THE FREEZE THAT SHOULD BE LIFTED WITHIN FIFTEEN MINUTES OF THAT WE BELIEVE THE PROVISION SHOULD BE INCLUDED UP FOR ACTS OF GOD SOMETIMES ARE COULD BE A CRISIS WHERE DATA CENTER COULD BE CLOSED DOWN. AND THAT INFORMATION CANNOT BE ACCEPTED WITH THAT FIFTEEN MINUTES. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE THAT IN PLACE IN OF THE INITIAL FREEZE WE'D LIKE TO HAVE A MAXIMUM THREE DAYS TO PLACE INITIAL FOR HOUSE. THIS IS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN AUTHENTICATE THE PERSON AN INDIVIDUAL WHEN THEY SUPPLIED THE INFORMATION TO US. THERE ARE MANY TIMES THAT WE RECEIVE INFORMATION WHERE WE MAY NOT HAVE COMPLETE INFORMATION WE MAY HAVE A PARTIAL TELEPHONE NUMBER PARTIAL NAME. PARTIAL ADDRESS AND UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS LAW WE WOULD STILL HAVE TO PLACE THAT INITIAL FREEZE. AND SO WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THAT COULD LEAD TO SOME FRAUDULENT CONTACT. ADDITIONALLY WE ALSO HAVE OBJECTION TO TO THE PARTS OF THE BILL ABOUT REPORTING THE INFORMATION TOGETHER CREDIT BUREAUS. RIGHT NOW THERE ARE NO SYSTEM EXISTS FOR SHARING THAT INFORMATION AMONG ALL THREE CREDIT BUREAUS. EACH OF THE NATIONAL CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES ARE INDEPENDENT IN THE. INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES WHO HAVE DIVERSE DATABASE PLATFORMS. THE SYSTEMS ARE PARTICULARLY COMPLEX WHEN INTEGRATED TAKES PLACE ACROSS CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES BECAUSE EACH AGENCIES HAS ITS OWN STANDARDS REGARDING DATA COLLECTION AND DESIGN. I BELIEVE WE HAVE SEEN OVER TIME THE COMPLEXITY OF HAVING CALIFORNIA STATE AGENCIES SHARE INFORMATION WHICH HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO ACCOMPLISH. PASSABLY THE PAST THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY AT HAVE STRUGGLED TO TRY TO BUILD A UNIFORM SYSTEM AMONG BOTH HOUSES. ALSO AND JUST AS IMPORTANT EACH CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY WILL WANT TO VERIFY THE CONSUMERS INFORMATION ON THEIR. OWN DATABASES THEY DON'T HAVE TO RELY AND THE OTHER CREDIT BUREAUS. AND ADDITIONALLY. UNDER THE LAW WE HAVE TO SEND A PASSWORD OR A PIN NUMBER TO EACH OF THE CONSUMER TO PLACE A FREEZE. SO EVEN IF A FREEZE THIS PLACE FOR EXAMPLE WITH EXPERIENCE WANT THAT INFORMATION IF WAS SENT OVER TRAINED UNION WE WOULD HAVE TO CONTACT THE CONSUMER. AND GIVE THEM A SPECIAL PIN NUMBER AND A PASSWORD IT WOULD HAVE TO VERIFY THEIR INFORMATION AGAIN. SO THAT'S WHERE WE SEE SOME TROUBLING PROVISIONS HERE. ALSO AND AND LASTLY WHAT THIS PROVISION ALSO REACHED TO IS THAT YOU COULD GO FOR EXAMPLE HERE AT A CAR DEALERSHIP AND THE CAR DEALERSHIP SAYS WELL WE USE EXPERIENCE FOR CREDIT REPORT. UNDER THIS LAW YOU COULD CALL TRAINED UNION AND REQUIRE THEM TO CALL EXPERIENCE TO HAVE THEM WITH THAT. SPECIFIC FREEZE FOR THAT PARTICULAR CASE FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED TO LESS AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THAT'S ON THE RECORD THINK YOU. MADAM CHAIR BOB. YOU KNOW I HAVE I I LIKE. WELL A LOT MORE PIECES OF THIS BILL LOT OF PROVISIONS I THINK ARE REALLY EFFECTIVE AND HAVING WORKED IN THIS INDUSTRY FOR. YOU KNOW MANY YEARS I CAN TELL YOU THAT. THAT I CAN SEE SOME ISSUES WITH SOME OF IT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY STUCK STRUCK ME AND IN ADDITION TO WHAT THE OPPOSITION JUST STATED PARTICULAR ABOUT THE REPORTING. THE CROSS REPORTING I THINK THAT'S A BUT SUDDENLY HAVE TO WORK OUT. A LITTLE MORE BUT ALSO I THINK WE NEED TO BETTER DEFINE THE RECEIVING OF THE REQUEST ELECTRONICALLY ESOS THAT WHEN IT HITS THE IN BOXES THAT. YOU KNOW EMAIL THIS THAT WHEN IT'S OPEN THIS THAT AFTER A BUTTON IS REPLIED ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR YOU KNOW HOW DO WE. HOW DO WE DEFINE THAT I THINK THAT CAN REALLY MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE? YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY WITH YOU KNOW WHAT CAN HAPPEN WITH THEM PENALTIES ETCETERA SO I THINK THAT'S OF A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN I HAVE. IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT IN THE IN THE FREEZING ISSUE WITH THE OTHER. BETWEEN THE AGENCIES THAT YOU'RE BECAUSE AT THIS POINT I'M. OKAY SO YOU'RE RIGHT WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A BETTER DEFINITION THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT OUT. AND I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO TALK TO THE OTHER AGENCIES I MEAN IF A CONSUMER. CAN LEAD NAY AGENCY KNOW THAT THEY WANT TO FREEZE. ARM AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT EXACTLY. THE DETAILS OF THAT WITHA. WITH THE CREDIT BUREAUS OTHER SHOULD BE AWAY TO GET THAT SAME INFORMATION. OF BY EMAIL OR. OTHER. ELECTRONIC. COMMUNICATION. BUT IT CLEARLY HAVE GOT TO TALK WITH THE. AGENCIES HERE IN DETERMINE. THE DETAILS OF HOW WE GET THIS ALL DONE AND I'M CERTAINLY. VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF MAKING SURE THAT WE GET THIS DONE PROPERLY. AND THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANY. DIFFICULTIES AND GO FROM THERE SO. I'D BE GLAD TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU OR. ANYONE ELSE FROM THE INDUSTRY BE WHERE I AM AND I T. GUY SARAH. BOB WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT WE CAN TALK DATA. THANK YOU FOR ALL THANK YOU I'VE FOR FOR THAT ANSWER WELL IT AT THIS PARTICULAR JUNCTURE. I DON'T THINK I'D BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT I CERTAINLY RESERVE THE RIGHT AS IT GOES THROUGH. ANY OTHER PROCESSES OR ANY MEMBER OF MY COME THROUGH AB MIGHT WANT TO JOIN HIS CO AUTHOR BUT I THINK IT THAT WITH SHAREABLE OF ISSUES I THINK I JUST CAN'T. I KILL IT THE WRONG THING ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR TRADE. YEAH I. ONE HOUR SO. AT MY FEELINGS ABOUT THIS A FIFTEEN MINUTES I IS SITE AND ELECTRONIC. AGE I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT HOWEVER LISTENING TO. OPPOSING SIDE THE. NOW MAYBE I YOU CAN TALK ABOUT. DE IT IT IT IN ALL. POSSIBILITIES CELL OR THE SOME PROBLEMS AND THE COME UP WITH THIS SOME. NOT COMPROMISED VERSION. LEKA IN BANKING AYE I SEE. WHEN I TRY TO TRANSFORM MY OWN MONEY WITHIN A BATON GOT FOR MY SAVINGS TO CHECKING WHATEVER. IT DOESN'T TRANSFER A SAYS DEPENDING. MEANING THAT THAT YEAH WE RECOGNIZE YOUR REQUEST HOWEVER IS THE PROCESS THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE IN LIKE A BATCH PROCESSING. IF THE MIDNIGHT SUBJECT THAT THE SHOW MAYBE SOME OF IT WE NEED YOU MEAN THERE WILL WILL WILL TALK WITH THE AGENCIES I WILL SAY THIS IF YOU GO AND BUY A CAR TO GET A RESPONSE PRETTY QUICKLY. SO. WELSH WILL HAVE TO DISCUSS THE TALES. THEN I'M GLAD TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A BILL THAT CAN BE X..

GRAYSON AYE. STONE. WEBER. THE BILL HAS FIVE VOTES AND FAVOR WILL LEAVE THAT OPEN AS WELL. RIGHT SO WITH THAT. I WILL PASS IT ON TO VICE CHAIR CHEN I THINK MEMBERS AT AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTY FOUR AT THE THEME PARK IN FOR ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA FINANCING LOTS REFLECT THE GROWING CONSUMER PROTECTION CONCERNS IN THE NON BANK LENDING MARKET. THE MARKET FOR CFL LOANS HAS EVOLVED RAPIDLY OVER THE PAST DECADE IN TWO THOUSAND SIX CFL LENDERS ORIGINATED ONLY FIFTY SEVEN. SMALL DOLLAR LOANS WITH AN INTEREST RATE GREATER THAN A HUNDRED PERCENT. FAST FORWARD TEN YEARS AND IN TWENTY SIXTEEN ALONE CFL LENDERS ORIGINATED NEARLY THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND SMALL DOLLAR LOANS WITH TRIPLE DIGIT INTEREST RATES REPRESENTING AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ONE POINT ONE BILLION. THESE RISKY LOANS ARE MARKETED TO CALIFORNIANS IN FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE STATE'S FINANCIAL REGULATOR HAVE THE APPROPRIATE TOOLS TO ENFORCE THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS PROVIDED BY THE LAW. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT TO ORDER RESTITUTION OFF OR DAMAGES FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE CFL. AND TO MAKE THE CONSUMERS HOLE WHEN THEY FALL VICTIM TO UNFAIR OR DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES. THIS BILL WOULD ALSO INCREASE THE PENALTIES FOR VIOLATING THE CFL TO A MAXIMUM OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FOR A GREGOR IT'S VIOLATIONS BY NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL ACTORS WITH A HISTORY OF VIOLENT LA LA CONSISTENT WITH THE CFL PENALTIES AUTHORED BY THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE MORTGAGE LENDING ACT AND OTHERS. AS THE FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION RURAL PULLS BACK IT'S ENFORCEMENT EFFORT THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO STEP UP AND EQUIP OUR FINANCIAL REGULATOR WITH THE TOOLS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. THE BILL HAS THE SUPPORT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT AND A COALITION OF CONSUMER ADVOCATES WHO ARE HERE TODAY TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT. SUZANNE MARTIN IS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU HAD CHAIR MEMBERS SUZANNE MARTIN DEL WITH CONSUMERS UNION AYE AND THAT A COALITION OF CONSUMER ADVOCATES SUBMITTED A LETTER IN IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. ESPECIALLY AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE WATCHING REALLY DEVASTATING A ROLL BACKS OF CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. IT ISN'T NOW MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER THAT CALIFORNIA SETS UP A WALL OF CONSUMER PROTECTION SHALL WE SAY AROUND THE STATE AND ENSURES THAT OUR PRIMARY FINANCIAL REGULATOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. HAS OF THE RANGE OF TOOLS THAT IT NEEDS TO MAKE CONSUMERS HOLE AGAIN OF THE ONE OF THE GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE FEDERAL CONSUMER BUREAU WAS THAT IT REFUNDED TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS BACK TO YOU KNOW TWENTY NINE MILLION PEOPLE. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY'RE NOT REALLY GOING TO DO THAT ANYMORE IN FACT THEY'VE REALLY STEPPED DOWN A LOT OF THEIR ENFORCEMENT UNDER THE CURRENT ACTING DIRECTOR MICK MULVANEY. WHO WAS VERY HOSTILE TO THE AGENCY WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE THAT IT SHOULD EXIST? BUT THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT WILL NOT IS INCREDIBLY. YOU KNOW SAD AND HEARTBREAKING FOR US TO SEE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE CAN DO SOMETHING HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE DB OUT HOW THE FLEXIBILITY WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO COURT. TO USE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES TO RETURN MONEY BACK TO CONSUMERS AND OF COURSE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR LAW IS PROVIDING PERCEPTIVE VISION OF AUTHORITY TO ISSUE PENALTIES FOR WHAT CAN YOU REALLY EGREGIOUS VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW. SO FOR FOR THESE REASONS ARE WE I'M REALLY APPRECIATE THE CHAIRS LEADERSHIP AND TAKING THIS ON. IT'S INCREDIBLY TIMELY AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND REQUEST NIGHT THAT. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON RONALD COLMAN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION CLICK ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. BUT I FEEL UP ON THAT FROM THE CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING AND STRONG SUPPORT AS WELL. NOW ARE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MISTER VICE CHAIR MEMBER SCOTT GOVERNOR HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION WE DON'T OBJECT TO DB EL UPDATING ITS ENFORCEMENT POLICIES. ARE OBJECTION WITH THE BILL LIES IN THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF LATITUDE THIS BILL GIVES DVL. MOST LAWS INCLUDING THOSE REFERENCED IN THE ANALYSIS ACTUALLY SPELL OUT LEVELS OF PENALTIES FOR EXAMPLE AND IT BURDEN THERE WILL BE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. FIRST WILLFUL VIOLATION BE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SO ONE AND SO ON AND THAT'S DONE TO PROVIDE SOME. CERTAINTY AND ENSURE THAT. TO A TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR FINE AND IT'S. DISCRETION. THERE ARE NO PARAMETERS THERE SO EVEN AGAIN THE LAW FINANCIAL CODE FIVE ZERO FIVE ZERO ZERO WHICH IS REFERENCED IN THE ANALYSIS PROVIDES THAT VERY THING A PROVIDES THAT. CERTAIN PENALTIES WILL BE ADJUSTED BASED ON. THE SEVERITY AND AS THE AUTHOR NOTED THIS DOESN'T ACTUALLY APPLY JUST A NEGLIGENT WILLFUL PENALTIES WITH TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS APPLIES TO WAS WHATEVER DB O. WANTS IT TO. SURE THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE A FINDING BUT WE ARE SEEKING A SPECIFICITY AND LEVELS OF PENALTIES CONSISTENT WITH. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA LAW SO FOR THESE REASONS WE HAVE OPPOSE POSITION WAS AMEND. OR. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. STATEMENT OUT A PRETTY ON BEHALF OF THE INNOVATIVE LENDING PLATFORM ASSOCIATION AND OPPOSITION. BUT ANYMORE. I SAY NONE ANY QUESTIONS FOR MARK ME MEMBERS. AFTER COSTA. UP THE E. I MORE OF A STATEMENT THAN A REAL ANYTHING I I THINK. I'M I'M GOING THROUGH THIS I HAVE HOPE OF SOME CONCERNS ABOUT. AND I UNDERSTAND WE'RE GOING WITH THIS SITE AYE APPLAUD IT I I HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANCE EARNS A WITH THE. THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING FROM TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR WILLFUL VIOLATION. TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OR FOR ANY VIOLATIONS SPELLED OUT HERE IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE WILLING TO TELL TO LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE ON BECAUSE THAT'S. IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY BIG JUMP THERE SO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR TO THAT DB OWES ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS AND CALIFORNIA'S ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACTS. SO HEARINGS ARE PRESIDED OVER BY AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE AND A KEY AND AN ACCUSED PERSON HAS THE RIGHT TO APPEAL ANY DECISION SO IT'S NOT JUST ARBITRARY THERE REALLY IS A LOT JUDGE INVOLVED. TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION AND SO. YEAH WELL BERMAN RIGHT AYE AYE AYE THAT'S GOOD I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT. BUT I AM ALSO CONCERNED BECAUSE WE'RE WE'RE REFERENCING OTHER BILLS HERE AND THE LAW. ACTUALLY HAS YOU KNOW STIPULATES METHODOLOGIES WE DON'T HEAR. IT'S SET YOU NINE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. I I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST TALKING POINT THAT I HAVE WITH THIS. I MEAN IT'S JUST. ANY KIND OF. YOU DIDN'T DOT AND I ACROSS CITY WE COULD END UP I'M NOT SAYING WE WILL. BUT WE COULD END UP WITH THIS TWENTY POUNDS ARE FINE IF THE BO JOE'S TO DO THAT IS THE BE ALL HERE TO. NO DVRS NOT HERE BUT THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES THE DDO BASED THE PENALTY ON THE AMOUNT OF. GRAVITY OF THE VIOLATION THE HISTORY OF A PERSON'S PREVIOUS VIOLATIONS AND WHETHER THE PERSON'S ACTIONS WERE NEGLIGENT WILL FOR OUR KNOWING SO THERE ARE SOME METRICS. ON AND THOSE METRICS COMBINED WITH EXISTING LAWS IS WHAT WOULD HELP US THE YOU KNOW A AT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE DETERMINE WHAT THAT WOULD BE. OKAY DO YOU HAVE. ABOUT WHERE THAT HIS THE EXISTING LAWS ARE. NOT YEAH ACTUALLY YOU'RE AYE AYE IT'S INDIAN OUNCES BUT ALSO THOSE I'M ESTIMATES THAT THEM AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE BILL ITSELF. IT IS ON PAGE NINE. AND IT IS LINE EIGHTEEN TWENTY TWENTY AT TWENTY TWO SEVENTY ONE THREE POINT ONE YOU'RE READY FOR THIS QUESTION MARGIN. OKAY AND THEN YOU CAN ALSO LOOK AT THE LAST THAT THREE LINES THIRTY SEVEN THREE THIRTY NINE OKAY. GREAT WELL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT OUR PUBLIC PLAYOFF AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT BUT BUT THANK YOU FOR YOU KNOW COGENT ANSWERS ON THAT. DOESN'T PHILLIP BETTER THINK DIFFERENTLY AND LIKE. BUT ANYWAY. ALRIGHT HERE ARE. THE. ASSEMBLYMAN ON THE MOON SO REPLY TO OPPOSITION A STATEMENT MY LOGO. SURE. YOU KNOW IT CERTAINLY WE UNDERSTAND THE A LJ. PROVISION. THE PROBLEM BEING IS TO CHALLENGE THIS ESPECIALLY FOR A SMALL CFL COULD EXCEED THE VALUE OF THE. PENALTIES THEMSELVES. MORE TO THE POINT. WHEN A PENALTY OR VIOLATION OCCURS. IF YOU MAKE A VIOLATION FOR EXAMPLE ON THE PAPERWORK ODDS ARE THAT VIOLATION WILL OCCUR ON EVERY SINGLE. LONG SO YOU COULD HAVE HUNDREDS OF VIOLATIONS SO WELL EVEN IF THERE INADVERTENT ERRORS. SO WILL DB OUR COULD DPO USE THAT AS AN EXCUSE TO RATCHET UP THE PENALTIES SAYING THERE'S A HISTORY OUR PATTERN WHEN IN FACT THE VIOLATION WAS A RECURRING VIOLATION. THAT WAS INADVERTENT IN NATURE AGAIN TO THE EXTENT OF THE LAW WAS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER WHAT'S WITH THAT INADVERTENT ERRORS MAY BE. YOU KNOW FIND X. Y. Z. THAT WOULD PROVIDE SOME CERTAINTY AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE LOOKING. I I THINK I'VE GONE THROUGH THE RESPONSE ANNA AND SO I MEAN YEAH I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME OF THE METHODOLOGY THAT THAT IN PLACE AND ON ITS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER LAWS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. AND AGAIN THE THE INTENT IS NOT WHAT I MEAN WE DON'T WANT. I ANY OF THESE AGENCIES IT TO. US BE IN VIOLATION UP BUT THE INTENT IS THAT THE TWENTY FIVE GOING FROM TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND IS THAT IT'S MEANINGFUL ENOUGH SO THERE WILL BE AN INTERESTS NOT TO VIOLATE. AS OPPOSED I THINK YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS AND IF IT'S GONNA GO THROUGH AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE I'M SO THE HOPE IS THAT DB ó CAN HELP. ALL THESE ORGANIZATIONS BEFORE IT EVER GETS TO THE POINT OF A VIOLATION THIS IS IF THERE IS EVIDENCE THERE IS HISTORY OF A VIOLATION THEN THIS IS WHERE THIS COMES IN. I'M AND I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW IT IS OUR HOPE AND THAT THERE ARE EVALUATION. IT THAT THERE ARE INTO ANY VIOLATIONS I THINK IT'S A HOPE OF DB ó THAT THERE ARE VIOLATIONS AS WELL. YOU KNOW MY FEELING IS THAT I THINK THIS IS A PLAN FOR THAT INCREASES SUCH AS THE TWO SEVERE AND THEN IF YOU CAN ACCOMMODATE UP POSITIONS ARE AWESOME POINT OF VIEW SO THAT WOULD BE MORE REASONABLE. AND. WHAT THE ANY CASES? THAT THAT BEHIND THAT DISAPPEAR ALL WHOM Y.. THAT MUCH DRASTIC INCREASE. IN ALL I'M I'M TRYING TO YOU KNOW COMPARED THE AMOUNT THAT THAT THE YOU ARE. INFORMED THREE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND IN AYE I TRY TO NOT IN SO JASTA. A DEFINED FROM THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS TO FIFTY ARE ARTISTS HOPEFUL ON VIOLATING DROPPING. SOME HAS OF THOSE MATERIALS ON THE FREEWAY I RAN INTO A LOT OF WELL NOW OPPOSITION SO BUT THE HERE IS SUCH A STIR. IN A TEN FOR THE INCREASES TO IT CAN BE. DETRIMENTAL AND TO CBO ON CERTAIN YOU KNOW ON INTENDED. THE PDF FILE ARROWS TO UP VIOLATIONS OF THAT'S WHY IF YOU CAN ACCOMMODATE THAT. THE OPPOSITION OPPOSITION SO NO SIDE OF OUR. NO APPEALED THEN IT MIGHT BE WE SET UP. THERE THERE IS AN APPEAL IN PLACE AND I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT THE MARKET HAS pIS MUCH BIGGER. A AND I AS I NOTED IN AT THE IT'S A NOTED IN THE ANNOUNCES I ALSO NOTED IN MY COMMENTS AND THAT THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER LAWS IN PLACE AND OTHER FEES OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. I'M OR IN THAT RANGE. WITH CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LENDING ACT AND OTHERS AND SO THAT IS STATED I'M IN THE ANALYSIS. AND I THINK IT'S JUST AGAIN IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS AD THE INDUSTRY IS BIGGER AND THE INTENT AND DESIRE IS NOT FOR VIOLATIONS TO TAKE PLACE BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY A VIOLATION IS REALLY. I'M A VIOLATION AGAINST THE CONSUMER SO WE WANT CONSUMERS TO USE PRODUCTS THAT. ARE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THEY WERE INTENDED FOR WE WANT ON THEM TO BE REALLY THE BENEFICIARY THE BENEFICIARY OF THESE PRODUCTS AND SO. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS IN LINE WITH THAT. SONOROUS. THANK YOU CHAIR AND DABBED VICE CHAIR AND ALSO SOMEONE MEMBER THANK YOU FOR THE BILL AYE. AYE YOU ADDRESSED SOMEONE ABOUT THE APPEALS PROCESS WHAT WHAT IS THE APPEALS ó WHO. HOW HOW IS IT THAT IF SOMEONE IS ASSESSED A FINE? NOW I FIND AND THEY THEY BELIEVE THAT. IT WAS NOT JUST HOW WOULD THEY GO ABOUT. DO THEY GO BACK TO THE VERY ONE THAT FIND THEM. SO THEY LEAD AND I'M GONNA ACTUALLY. UNDER THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE WOULD MAKE THAT APPEAL. OKAY IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE WAS THE. THAT JUDGE ALSO THE ONE THAT ASSESSED THE FINE. THAT LOOK GOOD. SO. CERTAIN THE DB ó REQUESTS. THE ACTION THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE DB ó. ALRIGHT SO YOU SEE THE COURT. SO YOU YOU BASICALLY GO BACK TO THE COURT AND SAY TO THE VERY LOWS THAT FIND CHIU. AND YOU. YES YOU GO BACK TO THE THE ONES WHO FIND YOU TO SAY THAT THEY THAT YOU HAVE EVIDENCE THAT WAS THAT. AND SO THEY HAVE THAT MIND A FINDING AGAINST HIMSELF. NO THIS A SUPERIOR COURT OKAY THIS IS NOT EVEN TO THE EXTENT THAT IS A SEPARATE IF I DON'T AGENCY CORRECT OKAY. JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. AND WHAT KIND OF SAFETY NETS THERE ARE FOR ANY INJUSTICES THAT MIGHT TAKE PLACE OR AN AGENCY. THAT MAY HAVE DONE SOMETHING AND ACCESS I'M I'M I'M FOR WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE AND I. JOHN TRYING TO HELP MAKE THE CASE BUT I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE. PROTECTIONS FOR THE BUSINESS AND OR FOR THE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS. PROTECTIONS WERE TRYING TO PROVIDE FOR THE CONSUMERS. I'M SORRY I DID MEAN INTERRUPTS. WHAT YOU'RE DOING SO THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH ANY WAY THAT OTHER? I REGULATORS WOULD GO THROUGH THIS TO THIS IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU SEE IN OTHER SPACES BOTH IN THIS INDUSTRY AND OUTSIDE OF THIS IS A COMMON PRACTICE IS THAT ON OTHER INDUSTRIES I MEAN. AND OUR OTHER AGENCIES AS WELL RIGHT OKAY THAT'S THAT THIS WOMAN. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. FOR AUSTIN YEAH YOU NEED WHO SETS UP A BIT AFTER THE FACT THAT I WANT TO DATE A PICKUP ON. A YOU'D MENTION THAT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND OTHER. OTHER BILLS ETCETERA BUT YOU ALSO MENTION THE THE CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE MORTGAGE LENDING ACT. OB DO YOU HAVE THAT LANGUAGE AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE. YEAH SO TIGHT ON THIS BUT YOU'RE REFERENCING. OTHER LANGUAGE DO YOU HAVE THAT LANGUAGE BECAUSE I MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT LANGUAGE. SPELLS OUT THE PENALTIES SPELLS OUT THE STEPS IN THE PROCESS NOT. ALLUDES TO A STEP IN A PROCESS THAT'S REALLY. MY CONCERN SO MY CONCERN FOR YOU IS THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA SAY IT'S JUST LIKE THIS OTHER. YOU KNOW THING OVER HERE IF THE IF THE FINE AMOUNT. NOT THE FINAL WITHIN THAT RIGHT OUT AND SO THAT OF THE OTHER PROCESS THE OTHER BILLS WITHIN TO MISTER REASONS RIGHT IS WRITTEN GRAVITY. OF THE VIOLATION. THE HISTORY. OF THE PREVIOUS VIOLATIONS AND WHETHER THE PERSON'S ACTIONS WERE NEGLIGENT WILL FOR OUR KNOWING OKAY BUT THAT THOSE ARE ALL OF THOSE THAT HAD SO RIGHT AND SO THAT'S WHY IT WOULD IT BE DB ó. IT WOULD BE AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE BUT THROUGH IT HAS AMPLE EXPERIENCE WITH. THIS OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE INFORMATION TO MAKE THAT DETERMINATION BUT. BUT LIMITED GUIDELINES AS IN AS THE THE OPPOSITION POINTED OUT. IN OTHER BILLS THEY IT SAYS SPECIFICALLY YOUR FIRST VIOLATION FOR WHOOPS I'M AYE I SCREWED UP ON A PERIOD A COMMA WHICH RIGHT. THAT'S TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS OR FIFTY DOLLARS OR WHAT HAVE YOU THIS COULD BE THE LETT THE MESS HAVE LAW JUDGES SAYING HEY. THIS COULD BE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A PERIOD AND YOU DID IT FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE TIMES BECAUSE IT'S IT'S ON A PREPRINTED FORM. SO NOMINEE GO FORESTS HAVE DOLLARS PER VIOLATION THAT THAT'S MY CONCERN THAT IT'S NOT REALLY SPELLED OUT HERE SO I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT BUT I I REALLY WANT TO BE CLEAR. THAT I THE OTHERS OTHER BILLS YOUR FRANK TO HAVE REAL SPECIFICS ON BUT THANK YOU. GRAYSON AYE AYE AGAIN BY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THIS IS WHERE I WAS TRYING TO. TO GO. THE ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGES INDEPENDENT FROM YES. THE DB ó AND SO THERE'S THE TIE THERE IS NOT ESTABLISHED WHERE THEY'RE WORKING IN CONJUNCTION. IT SAID COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT PARTY AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THE LINE OF PROTECTION THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE. TO THE INDUSTRY WHILE TRYING TO REACH OUT PROVIDE I'M NOT TRYING TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH SO THAT WHILE YOU'RE TRYING TO BURY MY LOOK AT LEAST I THINK WHILE YOU'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR THE CONSUMER. IS THAT THE CASE CORRECT. REVIEW THE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE OF MADAM CHAIR WAS LIKE CLOSE I AT RESPECTFULLY ASK UP FOR AN AYE VOTE I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AT BILL TO PROTECT CONSUMERS AND TO ENSURE. THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN PLACE I WITH LIMITED AND NO VIOLATIONS. THANK YOU MANAGEMENT THERE'S ENJOYS A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ON APOLOGIZE IS OUR MOTION A SECOND. THANK YOU. AB TWENTY NINE EIGHTY FOUR DO PAST COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. LIMON. I LIMON AYE CHEN. GENO ACOSTA. OKAY ACOSTA NOT VOTING BERMAN. BURKE. CALDERON. CALDERON AYE CHOI. CHOI NO. GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE GRAYSON. GRAYSON AYE STONE. WEBER. WEBER I. THIS WILL BE ON CALL MANAGER. AND MEDICARE AT YOUR PLEASURE ALRIGHT SO NOW WE HAVE AB AT THIRTY TEN. AND A. B. THIRTY TEN SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN CURRENT ONE LOAN AT A TIME POLICY FOR PAYDAY LENDING AND ESTABLISH A REAL TIME DATA BASE TO HELP LENDERS AND THE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. MAKE SURE ONE LOAN AT A TIME LENDING IS NOT VIOLATED. IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX S. B. NINETEEN FIFTY NINE. BY SENATOR CHARLES CALDERON ESTABLISHED THE PAYDAY LOAN PROGRAM THAT ORIGINAL LEGISLATION CONTAINED ONE LOAN AT A TIME LANGUAGE PROHIBITING ANY LENDER FROM ENTERING INTO A SECOND PAYDAY LOAN WITH THE BAR BEFORE THE FIRST PAYDAY LOAN WAS PAID OFF. THAT LANGUAGE REMAINS IN CURRENT LAW. THE LEGISLATURE SET A MAXIMUM PAYDAY LOAN LIMIT OF THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN ORDER TO KEEP THE SIZE OF THE LOAN AT THE LEVEL THAT COULD BE PAID OFF WITHIN A PAYDAY CYCLE OR SOON THEREAFTER. AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO REMIND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT THE LENDERS THAT WISH TO LAND ABOVE THREE HUNDRED PAYDAY LIMIT CAN DO SO. AND ARE GOVERNED BY THE CALIFORNIA FINANCE LAW OR CFL. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER AS OVER THE YEARS BARS HAVE FOUND A WAY AROUND THE ONE LOAN AT A TIME POLICY AND THE WAY TO EXTEND THE DURATION OF PAYDAY DEBT. MUCH LONGER THAN ENVISIONED WITH THE ORIGINAL LENDING PROGRAM. LOAN STACKING. OR TAKING OUT MULTIPLE LOANS AT A FROM MULTIPLE LENDERS AT THE SAME TIME ALLOWS BARS TO FAR EXCEED THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR PAYDAY LOAN LIMIT ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED BY S. B. NINETEEN FIFTY NINE. AT ONE TIME ONLINE LINING THE NOT EXIST AND THE THOUSANDS OF PAYDAY LENDING STORES WERE NOT YET BUILT. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE AVERAGE APR OF A PAYDAY LOAN WAS THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY TWO PERCENT AS REPORTED BY THE DDO WITH MORE BUYERS TAKING OUT MORE THAN TEN LOANS PER YEAR THAN BARS TO TAKE OUT JUST ONE. UNFORTUNATELY WITHIN THE PAYDAY LOAN PROGRAM WHEN A BORROWER CANNOT PAY BACK THE LOAN WITHIN A SINGLE PAYER PERIOD FAR TOO MANY BARS OPT OUT TO TAKE. A LONG SEQUENCE OF LOANS GETTING PAID PAYING OFF THE LOAN AND THEN IMMEDIATELY TAKING OUT A NEW LOAN. THE SPEED AT WHICH THESE FEES ADD UP FOR BARS OF THE BENEFIT OF THIS ACCESS TO CAPITAL IS DISTURBING. THE DB ARE REPORTS THAT THE AVERAGE CONSUMER TAKES OUT SIX POINT FOR PAYDAY LOANS PER YEAR. THE CFL RECOGNIZES THE GREATER RISK TOOK BARS TO TAKE OUT LOANS GREATER THAN THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS THIS IS WHY THE CFL CAPS INTEREST RATES AND PROVIDES FOR GREATER CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ABOVE THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR PAYDAY LOAN LIMIT UP TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED. THIS BILL DOES NOT SEEK TO AND PAYDAY LENDING. PAYDAY LENDING CAN BE A VALUABLE TOOL FOR CALIFORNIA'S WHEN USED PROPERLY PROPERLY WITHIN REASONABLE LIMITS. THIS BILL SEEKS TO RE ESTABLISH THE ORIGINAL PAYDAY LOAN SPEED LIMIT OF ONE LONE AT A TIME FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE SUSAN A MARTIN DEL SENIOR ATTORNEY FOR THE CONSUMERS YOUR UNION TEST TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ISO SAN MARTIN DELF WITH CONSUMERS UNION. I ALONG WITH A COALITION OF OTHER CONSUMER GROUPS SUBMITTED A LETTER IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WE THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY COMMON SENSE AND IT DOES REALIGNED ALONG WITH THE ORIGINAL INTENT. OF THOSE WHO ORIGINALLY BROUGHT PAYDAY LENDING INTO THE STATE AYE SPEED LIMITS A GOOD TERMS I THINK RIGHT WORK SPEED RIGHT NOW. IT IS AB WITH BRICK AND MORTAR AND ONLINE THE LENDING STORES AGGRESSIVELY MARKETING TO CONSUMERS PEOPLE GET IN OVER THEIR HEAD THEY GET IN OVER THEIR HEAD REALLY QUICKLY. AND HAVING TO BORROW FROM PETER TO PAY PAUL AS IT WERE. REALLY PUTS PEOPLE INTO A SITUATION THAT CAN BE INCREDIBLY DEVASTATING OF COURSE AS THIS COMMITTEE HAS HEARD YOU KNOW MORE THAN ONCE I OF THESE LOANS ARE VERY EXPENSIVE THEY'RE VERY DIFFICULT TO REPAY. AND THEY CAN PUT PEOPLE INTO INCREDIBLE FINANCIAL STRESS AND KENYA RUIN THEIR CREDIT AND INCREASE AND IT GREATLY IMPACT THEIR LIVES ON IN VERY NEGATIVE WAYS AND SO I YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD. ENSURE AYE AND AS OTHER STATES HAVE DONE YOU A SETTING UP A DATABASE TO ENSURE THE LENDERS KNOW IF SOMEONE'S ARE INDEBTED AND MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T. STOCK THEM UP EVEN FURTHER WITH MORE DEBT THE COULD AT THE COULD EXACERBATE THE ALREADY STRESSED CIRCUMSTANCES AT THE VERY COMMON SENSE APPROACH. WILL BE BELIEVE OF COURSE AS MANY CONSUMER GROUPS DO THAT THERE IS MORE TO BE DONE TO REFORM THIS INDUSTRY MORE COMPREHENSIVELY BUT WE DO APPRECIATE THIS MEASURE BECAUSE WE THINK THAT IT IS A GOOD. RIDE NARROWLY TAILORED SOLUTION TO SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT AND TO NORMALIZE OF THE EXISTING. MARKETS THAT WE CAN THEN TAKE A BREATH IN THE MOVE FORWARD WITH A GREAT REFORM OF OF OF THE INDUSTRY SO FOR THESE REASONS WE SUPPORT THE BILL AND REQUEST RIGHT UP. THE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU A VICE CHAIR I APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO COME BACK A COUPLE WEEKS AGO WE WERE HERE. ARE MY NAME IS DAN GWALTNEY ON THE PRESIDENT A CALIFORNIA FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS WE HAD THE. PLEASURE OF INTER DO OUR OF SPEAKING LAST TIME ON ON A BILL THAT. UP LIKE I KIND OF RAP ALWAYS UP IT AND ALL THESE DIFFERENT BILLS UP AND OUT OF ONE PACKAGE IT'S ABOUT CONSUMER ACCESS. THE SHORT TERM CREDIT ON ONE THING I DID WANTED TO BEFORE IT REALLY INTO IT I WANTED TO. LET YOU KNOW THAT ADD TO THE HISTORY OF OF WHAT WAS ALREADY PRESENTED HERE TODAY AS WELL AS WHAT'S IN THE ANALYSIS. WE ACTUALLY NEGOTIATED THIS I WAS ACTUALLY THERE IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO AND THREE WHEN WE WERE NEGOTIATING AT WHEN WE MOVED A LOT OF THE DVL. AND CONSUMERS UNION ANNA AND MEMBERS LIKE ON MYSELF AND OTHERS ACTUALLY NEGOTIATED WITH CONSUMERS UNION AND THEY SUPPORTED. OF THE BILL AT THE TIME IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS NOT ONE LOAN PER INDUSTRY WAS ONE LONE RESTRICTED PER PER LENDER AND BORROWER. SO UP AND THAT'S BEEN THE ENFORCEMENT THAT THIS IS BEEN THE ENFORCEMENT. OF THE BY THE DDO SINCE THEN THERE'S BEEN AN ADDITIONAL ADVISORY HEARINGS ON THIS THAT WE PARTICIPATED WITH THE DDO AND CONSUMERS UNION RIGHT AFTERWARDS. AND WAS ALL UNDERSTOOD THAT THE BAR WAS RESTRICTED TO ONE LONE PER OF PER LENDER BUT NOT FOR INDUSTRY. UP OUR GENERAL CONCERN WITH THIS BILL AND WE WERE IN OPPOSITION UNFORTUNATELY TO IT BECAUSE. IT'S ONCE AGAIN IT'S RESTRICTING ACCESS TO CREDIT OF THE BILL THAT THE ORIGINAL PAYDAY LAW WAS ENACTED TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO. IN TWENTY ONE YEARS AGO AND ONCE AGAIN IT'S NOT A THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN THIS IS A TWO FIFTY FIVE WON'T REALLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IS WHAT A CONSUMER CAN REALLY WALK OUT WITH GIVEN THE FEES. AND SO THAT HAS NOT INCREASED SINCE TWO TO A TIP FOR TWENTY ONE YEARS BUT OF COURSE THE EXPENSES TO THE CONSUMER HAVE INCREASED. DURING THAT PERIOD TIME ALONG WITH OBVIOUSLY EXPENSES TO THE LENDER AS WELL. SO OF THERE'S JUST SOME ADDITIONAL CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE. WE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ACCESS ACROSS THE BOARD IN UNFORTUNATELY WE I FEEL LIKE WHETHER IT'S. I AB TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED INSTALLMENT LENDING OVER TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT LENDING UNDER THREE HUNDRED. WE'RE KINDA SQUEEZING. A BALLOON WHAT WE'RE DOING IS IS WORK WERE SQUEEZING SOMETHING THAT REALLY ISN'T DEMAND IS STILL THERE IF WE'RE GONNA RESTRICTED HERE. WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE A REAL APPROACH TO SOLVE THIS HOLISTICALLY AND THAT APPROACH. IS TO SOLVE THE CFL. CUSTOMERS WOULD NOT HAVE TO GO TO MULTIPLE PAYDAY BORROWER OF PAYDAY LENDING COMPANIES. TO GET THE FUNDS THAT THEY NEED IF IT WAS AVAILABLE UNDER THE CFL AT A RATE WHERE A. WILLING LENDER AND WILLING BORROWER CAN GET TOGETHER AND THE LENDER CAN MAKE A REASONABLE. A REASONABLE FEE AND PROFIT ON THAT LOAN IN THE PARKING AT THE MONEY THEY NEED WE DON'T HAVE THAT. OUR ASSOCIATION'S BEEN HER ALMOST EVERY YEAR WE'VE HAD BILLS THAT WE'VE INTRODUCED WE'RE TRYING TO HELP FIX THIS PROBLEM BUT WE REALLY NEED THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP AS WELL. IF YOU WERE TRYING TO RESTRICT THE OTHER ENDS OF IT BUT REALLY THE CORE PROBLEM IS CUSTOMERS NEED TO SET A THOUSAND DOLLAR LOAN. THEY NEED A SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN AND RIGHT NOW IN FORCE IN THE PILOT PROGRAMS NOT SATISFYING THAT. AND AS WE EAT AWAY THE EDGES WE'RE JUST GONNA LOSE THESE CONSUMERS TO UNLICENSED LENDERS. THANK YOU. BOB. THANK YOU BYE CENTER TOWN. I'M TONY HADLEY. ADVICE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF REGULATORY AFFAIRS FOR EXPERIENCE CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY THAT SPACE TO COSTA MESA CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE NOT SO MUCH TO ARGUE WITH THE. THE GOAL OF THE LAW BUT TO SAY THAT THERE'S A BETTER WAY. WHAT WE'RE? ENVISIONING CREATING HERE. IS ESSENTIALLY A STATE RUN SYSTEM WHERE AN INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY EXISTS IN THE MARKETPLACE. AT THE STATE RUN SYSTEM WOULD COPY OTHER LAWS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE IN ACTUALLY REDUCING. THE. ISSUES WITHOUT. BUT PAYDAY LENDING WHAT THEY DO IS CREATE A SILO OF INFORMATION. WITH THAT INFORMATION ONLY GOES TO THE LENDER TO TELL THEM WHETHER THERE'S ANOTHER LONG OUTSTANDING. AND WHAT IT DOES IS IGNORES WHAT REALLY IS AT THE HEART OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO WITH THESE CONSUMERS AND THAT HAS HELPED THEM BUILD BETTER CREDIT HISTORIES. SO I'M SUGGESTING. THAT THE STATE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER. LOOKING AT THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT EXISTS ARE FOR SPECIALTY CREDIT BUREAUS IN THE CASE OF EXPERIENCE WE RUN CLARITY SERVICES THERE ARE COMPETING. ARE. UP ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN THE MARKETPLACE THAT HELP LENDERS IN THE PAID A SHORT TERM ONLINE LENDING SPACE. WITH NOT ONLY. DATA BUT DATA ANALYTICS TO REALLY GET TO MORE THAN JUST DOES THIS PERSON HAVE AN OUTSTANDING LOAN. BUT IT. IS THIS PERSON CREDITWORTHY AND CAN THIS PERSON REALLY AFFORD THIS ABILITY TO PAY. SO THESE TYPES OF DATA ANALYTICS COULD COME INTO PLAY IF WE WERE USING THE EXISTING. SYSTEMS THAT ALREADY EXIST IN THE MARKETPLACE RATHER THAN CREATE A SILO. IT JUST TELLS YOU THAT THE PERSON IS TAKEN OUT A LOAN. IF THEY ARE PAYING THEIR LOAN ON TIME. THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN CREDIT FOR THAT. WE SHOULD KNOW THAT THESE PEOPLE HAVE A CREDIT HISTORY. IF THEY CAN ESTABLISH A CREDIT HISTORY WITH THE PAYMENT OF SHORT TERM LOANS SOON OTHER LENDERS WILL LOOK AT THEM AS CREDIT WORTHY. AND SEE THEM AS A AN INDIVIDUAL THAT MIGHT BE A SUITABLE FOR OTHER TYPES OF LOAN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THIS IS WHAT WE THINK. IS MOST IMPORTANT FOR ROB. UP FOR THE IDEA OF. BOB CREDIT BUILDING AND TRANSPARENCY IN CREDIT TRANSACTIONS NOW. OF THE REASON THESE. CREDIT BUREAUS AREN'T WORKING AS EFFICIENTLY AS THEY WOULD UNDER THIS SYSTEM IS THAT NOBODY'S COMPELLED TO REPORT IF YOU'RE GOOD WHAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO COMPEL. AND AND SHE REPORT TO A STATE BASED YOU CAN COMPEL THEM. TO REPORT TO ONE OF THESE CREDIT BUREAUS AND THEN THESE CREDIT BUREAUS CAN SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH OTHER CREDIT BUREAUS WHO ARE MIGHT PERHAPS CERTIFIED BY THE STATE. THEN THE LENDERS COULD HAVE A MARKETPLACE WHERE THEY COULD SEE THE DATA THEY CAN LOOK AT DATA ANALYTICS THAT COULD DETERMINE BETTER ABILITY TO PAY. AND SEE BETTER. HUB PERFORMANCE AND BEHAVIOR FROM THESE UP. THE CONSUMERS ALL IN THE. BROWN OF ATTEMPTING TO TRY TO HELP THEM BUILD A BETTER CREDIT HISTORY FOR THEMSELVES AND WE KEEP THEM SO I LOAD. AN INVISIBLE WE JUST ADD TO THE PROBLEMS. WE ESTIMATE THERE FORTY FIVE MILLION AMERICANS. IN THE UNITED STATES WHO ARE CREDIT INVISIBLE THEY DON'T HAVE A CREDIT REPORT. SO THEY'RE CAPTURED. BY. SHORT TERM LENDERS IF WE COULD BRING THEM IN TO THE VISIBILITY BAND EVEN THOSE LENDERS COULD OFFER THEM COMPETING PROCESSES BUT RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE NO HISTORY ON THE. WITHOUT DATA LINDER HATS TO. ASSESS RISK SOME WAY IF THEY HAVE DATA THAT CAN ASSESSMENT RISK IN A REASONABLE MANNER. SO I WOULD SAY THAT IF WE COULD DUBBED WORK TOWARD USING THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT EXISTS RATHER THAN CREATING ANOTHER CREDIT DATABASE WITH VERY LIMITED PERSON. A PURPOSE AND A SIGH LOAD PURPOSE OF KEEPING THESE PEOPLE IN AN INVISIBLE STATE WOULD BE BETTER OFF AND I'D LIKE TO WORK. OUT WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND AND AND. WITH EACH OTHER CHAIRPERSON IN ORDER TO. TO SEE IF THIS MIGHT WORK. YOU. THANK YOU ARE VICE CHAIR CHEN MEGADETH AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS JOINT COMMITTEE CALIFORNIA'S PANIC CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE. AND WE MUST RESPECT WE OPPOSE AB THIRTY TEN. AS PREVIOUS WITNESSES TO HAVE A STATE AND AS YOU ALL KNOW THIS IS ONE OF SEVERAL BILLS. THIS COMMITTEE HAS HEARD IN RECENT WEEKS THAT. I SHOULD TAKE AWAY CREDIT OPTION OPTIONS FROM HARD WORKING A CALIFORNIANS AND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS. ARM OUR ARE MEMBERS RELY ON A VERY A VARIETY OF SHORT TERM. CREDIT POLITICS NOT INCLUDING A PAYDAY LOANS A WHEN THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. OUR BIG. AND THE THING IS THEY FULLY UNDERSTAND THE FEES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH. BUT THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT. ARE THE FELINE A PAYDAY LOAN. ARE IS A LOT LESS THAN TO BOUNCE CHECKS IN EVEN LESS EXPENSIVE AYE IF YOU'RE FACING LATE FEES ON A VARIETY OF OF EXPENSES. CLEANING YOUR YOUR VEHICLE REGISTRATION READ OR WRITE AND. ARM SO FOR THOSE REASONS ARE OF SOME OF THE KEY REASONS WHY THEY THEY THEY THEY TAKE OUT THESE LOANS OUT THERE BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THEY NEED MORE THAN THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE. A. I DOLLARS A WHETHER IT'S TO REPLACE TIRES ON A WORK TRUCK. BY NEW CONSUMER BUYING A NEW REFRIGERATOR ON. YOU KNOW SOME CONSUMERS ARE PAID ONLY ONCE A MONTH. AND THAT THEN THE MIGHT BECOME SHORT BUT THEN YOU GOT. ABLE TO PAY OFF THESE LOANS EVEN IF YOU HAVE A TWO OF THEM ARM AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED MORE THAN THAN. MANY OF NEED MORE THAN ONE KNOWN AS TIME IF THEY ARE SHORT. ARM. UNFORTUNATELY. A THERE ARE NO. GOOD LEGAL OPTIONS FOR BORROWERS WHO NEED FIVE HUNDRED OR THOUSAND DOLLARS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. WHILE PAYDAY LOANS ARE NOT PERFECT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT THE ARE BETTER THAN GOING TO I'M LICENSE LENDERS OF DRIVING. THESE CONSUMERS TO THE UNDERGROUND ARM AND THAT'S WERE WE SEE A LOT OF ENDLESS PROBLEMS OUR FOR BORROWERS. THERE ARE NO LAWS. LIMITING HOW MANY CREDIT CARDS A CAR LOANS AND INDIVIDUAL CAN HAVE. CZAR QUESTIONNAIRES Y. LIMIT THE CREDIT OPTIONS FOR THOSE WITH IN PERFECT CREDIT PENALIZE THEM. I ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERN ABOUT THE DATABASE IN THIS BILL. IT IS SHOCKING THAT IN LIGHT OF THE HEADLINES. ARE IN REGARDS TO PRIVACY ISSUES BOND BETWEEN SOCIAL MEDIA DATA BREACHES THAT WE HAVE ALL EXPERIENCED AND MANY OF US OF PAT HAVE BEEN HAVE HAVE EXPERIENCE AS WELL. ARE THAT. THIS BILL WOULD MANDATE THE STATE TO COLLECT PERSONAL IDENTIFYING INFORMATION AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE VIOLENCE. THIS MAY HAVE AND WE FEEL THIS MAY HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF DRIVING UNDOCUMENTED THAT RESIDENTS AND OTHERS TO THEM UNREGULATED LETTERS VENDORS ON THE INTERNET. ARE THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT LICENSE LETTERS. WILL HAVE TO BE MET UNDERSTUDIES BILL AB THOUGHT THIRTY TEN ITEM IT IS SHOCKING ARE AN ONEROUS OF FOR THESE REASONS. WE MUSTA ASPIRIN OVER. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON JOHN CAPITA ABOUT THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS AND OPPOSITE. WATCHING ON BEHALF OF THE VANCE AMERICAN OPPOSITION. RAINY PERRY AIR REDUCE HAS HAD SOME HEALTH COMMITTEE CHOICE FINANCIAL ON OPPOSITE. PRINT MATS ON BEHALF OF MONEY TREE IN OPPOSITION. JABBA COVERT ON BEHALF OF CHECK AND CASH IN OPPOSITION. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. XENON COMMITTEE MEMBERS DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. SOMEONE HAS ALSO FLETCHER. AS YOU KNOW MY PERSONAL VIEW ON CREDIT REPORTING NAY I FOUND A LOT TO AGREE WITH. IN THE STATEMENTS MADE AND I THINK WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT WITH ALL OF THESE BILLS HAVE LAYS HIM AFFORDABLE HAPPY TO MOVE THIS BILL TODAY. I JUST THINK THAT WHAT'S MISSING WHAT I'VE SEEN MISSING. ANYTHING EVEN BILLS IS. A REAL EFFORT. IN MY COMMITTEE WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT OF ZERO CREDIT SCORES. TO ESTABLISH A CREDIT SCORE SO PEOPLE CAN GET OUT OF THIS MARKET COMPLETELY. UP AND SO I'M SURE AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS I'M SURE WILL AS THINGS MOVE CONTINUE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. I'M. TO DO THAT AND I'M ALSO A LITTLE CONCERNED. AND THIS IS JUST THE NATURE OF BILLS AS WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE NUMBER OF BILLS THAT WE'VE MOVED THROUGH NOW. IS MAKING SURE THAT THERE CONSISTENT TEN AND I'M SURE YOU. IT A COMMITTEE STAFF HAS DONE A GOOD JOB OF THAT BUT WE MADE A IT IT'S A LOT ALL AT ONCE AND SO I WANNA MAKE SURE. WE LOOK AT THE PRINCIPLES OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IT I MEAN YOU KNOW WHEN WE AGREE ON THIS OUT SO I I ANTICIPATE THAT YOU'LL BE SUPPORTIVE OF THOSE EFFORTS BUT. I'D BE HAPPY TO THE SPOT ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR SHARIA QUESTION. YEAH I DO. AGAIN I REALIZE. BASIC UNDERLYING INTENT OF THE PLO NAM NOW MY ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ANYMORE. HOWEVER THIS IS JUST JUST A TO PROTECT CONSUMER SIDE IT THAN NOT TO GO OVER WITH THE ABILITY TO REPAY. NOW HOWEVER WHAT I HEAR FROM OUR OPPOSITION SIDE IS THAT THE. AT THE END OF THE DAY DAISY MAYBE DON'T WANT SO WHO MAYBE ARE SUFFERING BECAUSE TO ME THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR SO. A IN TODAY'S STARTER IN ALL THE IT DOESN'T GOAL OF VERY FAR. OUR CAR REPAIR WHERE ANYTHING AUSA ANALYST IF THEY ARE IN THAT CATEGORY THEY NEED TO CAST RIGHT AWAY. SO I AM NOT. IT EVENTUALLY. DISPEL IT OUT MAY HURT THEM THOUGHT MORE THAN HELPING THEM. YEAH AND AND THE CREATING. BLACK MARKET. AND THE WAY TO THEY GO. ARE IN IF WELL THIS IS A STRICTLY ENFORCED DOT THEN ARE. ONE IN ONE PLACE SO FIVE YOU KNOW IF THEY NEED A FIVE ON TO ATTEND HOA ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS SO WITH THE THREE HUNDRED DAY INTO. TWO GOAL. SO I WONDER THUS SO MY. QUESTION MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT AND THE SECOND. QUESTION THAT THE INDIANAPOLIS IS SOME. THAT I HAVE WELL. HERE IS THAT THE EXAMPLES IN TWO WEEKS CUP PAYDAY PERIOD. LOAN AMOUNT PRINCE PRINT PRINCIPALLY AS A THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND THE FEE PAY IS A FORTY FIVE DOLLARS AND. UP NET LOAN PROCEEDS OR BE TWENTY FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS. WON'T ON JANUARY ASSIST SIXTEEN FOR A SAMPLE ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. CUMULATIVE. THE FEE ISN'T GOING UP TO A NINE YEAR. ARE LOOSE AGAIN. ARE AND THEN FORTY FIVE DOLLARS AGAIN HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE ETCETERA ETCETERA. LIGHT AFTER SEVERAL SEVERAL. WELL KNOWN SO IT COMES OUT TO BE YEAH. IN ALL A NEGATIVE. HOPE PROCEEDS OUT OF WHEN THAT WHEN THAT THIS HAS STUFF CORRECT ANALYSES SO WHAT EACH EACH. DE. SO FAR HAS BEEN ARE ALL FORTY FIVE DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS ACTS SO WHEN YOU ADD THE FORTY FIVE THAT'S THE COMMITTED. A FORTY FIVE PLUS FORTY FIVE IS NINETY AND YOU AT THE FORTY FIVE AND OTHER FORTY FIVE THAT'S A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TIMES A SECOND MONA WAS TIED AT THE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND IF THEY DREADED EVERY OF EVERY SINGLE ONE IS FORTY FIVE. YEAH YOU CHARGE YOU GUYS. BUT I THINK IT IS ABOVE FLAT FEE EACH AT EACH OF THREE HUNDRED OR COST ME OF FORTY FIVE DOLLARS TO BUT THE IS SECOND OWN A SECOND TIME YOU TAUGHT ME NINETY DOLLARS. KNOW THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT ACCURATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO THE WAY THE PAYDAY LOAN WORK FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT MAY HAVE NOT HAD EXPERIENCE WITH COMES IN. AND LET'S SAY THEY WISH TO BORROW TO FIFTY FIVE BECAUSE THAT'S USUALLY THE MAXIMUM DOLLARS THAT THEY CAN WALK OUT WITH THERE'S A FEE FOR THAT. THEY WRITE A CHECK FOR THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS WE DON'T CHARGE ANYTHING THE DAY THEY WALK IN. WE HAND THEM THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS AND THEY AGREED TO PAY DATE OUT TO THEIR NEXT PAYDAY LET'S SAY IT'S IN TWO WEEKS. SO ON THE FIFTEENTH OF THE MONTH THEY'RE GONNA COME BACK IN AND GIVE US THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT'S WHEN THEY PAY THAT FORTY FIVE DOLLAR FEE. UP AND THEN IF THEY WISH. LATER THEY CAN COME BACK AND WE BORROW AND THEN WE OF COURSE WOULD DO THE TRANSACTION OVER. SO WE'RE NOT CHARGING THEM ADDITIONAL NINETY DOLLARS FOR THREE HUNDRED ALL ALONE FOR CHARGING THEM FORTY FIVE DOLLARS AT THE TIME AT THE TIME THEY REPAY THE LOAN. IF THEY WISH TO DO IT AGAIN IT'S THE SAME TRANSACTION IT'S EXTREMELY SIMPLE. SOURCES SECOND TIME WHEN YOU GIVE ME THROWING A THOUGHTLESS YOU'RE TAUGHT NEW YORK IMMEDIATE TWENTY FIFTY FOUR. FIVE DOLLARS TO THE WALK OUT CORRECT AND AND I THINK ONE OF THINGS WE NOT I MEAN DOLLARS NOT NINETY DOLLARS ARE NOT CHARGING NINETY DOLLARS THAT STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT MAXIMUM FEE THAT WE CAN CHARGE. IS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE FACE FIVE THE CHECK SO WHETHER YOU COME IN ON JANUARY ONE AND BORROW TO FIFTY FIVE THE MAX WE CAN CHARGES FORTY FIVE DOLLARS IF YOU RETURN ON FEBRUARY OR YOU COME BACK IN APRIL. WE CAN ONLY CHARGE YOU AGAIN YOU WANNA BORROW TO FIFTY FIVE WHICH ARE TO FORTY FIVE DOLLARS AT THE END WHEN YOU PAY BACK THE LOAN IF YOU DON'T PAY BACK THE LOAN YOU KNOW YOU NEVER. ARE CHARGED BUT OBVIOUSLY CUSTOMERS THAT PAID BACK. WILL. WILL CALL IT WILL COLLECT A FEE AT THAT TIME BUT IT IS NOT AN ADDITIONAL. OKAY THAT EXPLAINS I THINK THIS SHODDY SOME. AND TO ME AND AND THAT THAT'S RIGHT DOES SAY KIM OF IT. LOOK YOU SEE THERE FEW MINUTE OF IT SAYS IT. ADDED. SO IF YOU. BUT THE. SECOND SECOND TIME AS LONG AS I. IF I WERE IF I EVERY TIME AND SO ALL OF THOSE EVERYDAY HIRES WILL BUILD FORTY FIVE. MULTIPLE OF FORTY FIVE RIGHT BECAUSE THEY'RE ADDED. THE SONG SOUNDS LIKE ON THAT PROCEED TO IS A NEGATIVE. YOU KNOW SO I THINK THAT THAT IT'S A WRONG WRONG PRISON PAGE RIGHT HERE I THINK ONE THING THAT WE THAT WE MAY NOT BE LOOKING AT IS THAT THE THE COSTS A LOT OF SOMEONE DOES COME BACK AND REPORT YES THEY GONNA HAVE TO PAY THE FEE AGAIN. JUST LIKE IF YOU USE YOUR CREDIT CARD YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY THE FEE AGAIN. YOU KNOW IF YOU BORROW A YOU KNOW IF YOU. RIDING IT ALONE ON A CAR YOU GONNA PAY A FEE THE SECOND TIME TO GO GET ALONG ON A CAR SO IT IS THE ONE THING I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL THAT WE COULD ADD TO THIS CHART WOULD BE. THE ASSUMPTION HERE IS THAT THE CUSTOMERS ONLY PAYING OUT MONEY. AND THEY'RE NOT IT THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY ANALYSIS HERE ABOUT. WHAT ARE THEY DOING WITH THE MONEY? THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT FORTY FIVE DOLLARS ASSIST LOSS THAT YOU THAT THERE'S NOT WORST IT WE SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE DOING WITH THE PROCEEDS. AND THEY'RE OFF SETTING ADDITIONAL COSTS ARE CONSUMERS ARE SMART. THEY WILL COME IN AND BORROW MONEY IF THEY HAVE A CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE FOR MORE ATTRACTIVE OPTION. THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THAT FORTY TO FORTY FIVE DOLLAR FEE IS CHEAPER THAN BOUNCING CHECKS. IF YOU BOUNCE A CHECK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD SAY WE DO WITH ONE OF THE MAJOR BANKS WELLS FARGO CHASER P. ABATE YOU'RE GONNA CHARGE BETWEEN THIRTY FIVE TO THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS. AND THE MERCHANT YOU BOUNCE THAT CHECK TO IS GONNA CHARGE TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS SO YOU'RE NORTH A FIFTY DOLLARS ALREADY. SO CONSUMERS KNOW THAT THAT FORTY FIVE DOLLAR FEE IS A LOT. A LOT LESS EXPENSIVE THAN THAT THAT BOUNCED CHECK WERE PAYING UTILITY LATE FEE SO THAT VALUE OF THOSE DOLLARS ARE. ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO REDUCE ECONOMIC IMPACT TO THAT CUSTOMER AND I THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE ADDED I THINK THAT WOULD HELP THE KIDS THE COMMITTEE UNDERSTAND AND THAT'S WHAT WE TO CONTINUE WOULD LIKE TO WORK ON THIS BEFORE THIS BILL. GETS PASSED. MISTER GRAYSON THANK YOU. JUST TO CLARIFY THE CHART DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE RIGHT. IN YOUR REPORT BECAUSE YOU DO I GET THE PART WHERE IT SAYS FEES PAID CUMULATIVE. BUT THE NET LOAN PROS. PROCEEDS. FOR THE GENEROUS SIXTEEN THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN WHERE YOU HAVE A CUMULATIVE FEE OF NINETY DOLLARS. YOU'RE STILL GETTING TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE NASH YES. YOU'RE NOT GETTING TO TEN. SO THEY'RE IN A. YES SO IT DOES APPEAR TO BE THAT THERE'S A FLAW HERE IN THE CHART. I TRIED TO A. ESPECIALLY WHEN. YEAH ACCENTUATE THE MESSAGE OF TRYING TO SEND AN IN AND IF I MAY. I DID CREATE A CHART AND SO HARD NOT TO BE OFFENSIVE NO NO NO. MORE THAN ANYTHING I WANTED TO BE INFORMATIVE SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND SO. I LABEL THAT LAST MET LOAN PROCEEDS AND SO WHEN YOU GET YOUR ORIGINAL LOAN. EVERY TIME YOU COME BACK AND HAVE TO RENEW THE LONG YES ANOTHER FORTY FIVE DOLLARS. YOU HAVE TO PAY AN ADDITIONAL FORTY FIVE DOLLARS AND SO WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SHOW WAS NO NOT AN ADDITIONAL YOU JUST PAY THE FORTY FIVE YES YES ANY YOU. KNOW CURRENT OTHER THREE HUNDRED DOLLAR LOAN AT THE SAME TIME WHICH IS WHY YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE LONG PRINCIPLE DOESN'T GO DOWN. OVER THE TIME AS YOU. AS YOU SEE QUINCE THESE LOANS YOU STILL OWE OWN YOU STILL. OWE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. BUT YOUR NET PROCEEDS GETS SMALLER AND SMALLER AS THE FEED THAT YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PAY EVERY TIME YOU ROLL THE LOAN OVER. OKAY I I KNOW. I'M I'M NOT SURE I AM NOT CONVINCED THAT SOME YOU HAVE TO HELP ME AND GET IT OUT OF THE CHURCH. MY APOLOGIES FOR NOT CREATING CLEAR CHARGE. THE WORSE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND I DO HAVE A QUESTION SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS FOR IT THE MADAM MADAM CHAIR I REALLY APPRECIATE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. I THINK IS GOING TO BE. IN YOUR TENT TO. BUT I CONSUMERS ON HOW OVER IT MOST OF. SOME OF PHONE CALLS I RECEIVED. OR LIKE WHAT THE OPPOSITION IS AND THE CONSUMERS IN WHICH THERE ARE ABLE TO. HAVE UNFORESEEN EMERGENCY TAKING CARE OF UNDER ONE LONE HAND STATE PARTAKEN ALMOST ACTING IF YOU WILL. SO DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO HAVE A PERVERSE EFFECT IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO PAY OFF. UNFORESEEN EMERGENCIES SO I THINK THAT HERE'S HERE THERE ARE THREE BIG SPACES RIGHT THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT A LOT IN THE LAST COMMITTEE IN THIS COMMITTEE. SO ONE OF THEM IS THE THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND UNDER IF YOU NEED MORE THAT YOU ACTUALLY GO TO THE PILOT PROGRAM. AND THAT'S THE REAL ONE TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND THAT IS AT A ONE NIGHT STAND I WANT TO CORRECT WHAT WAS SAID THAT THERE IS NOT A LEGAL. SPACE IN PLACE THERE IS ILLEGAL SPACE AND PLACE THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO GO UP TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND THEN WE HAVE IF YOU RECALL FROM THE LAST ONE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED UP TO TEN. SO WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT THREE SPACES THIS IS ONLY ABOUT ONE SPACE SO IF YOU NEED MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL SPACE WITH DIFFERENT LAWS THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT DEAL WITH THIS THAT THE THAT THE PILOT PROGRAM. AND THAT PEOPLE CAN GO INTO IF THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IS NOT ENOUGH THEN YOU GO INTO ANOTHER SPACE THAT GOES FROM TWENTY FIVE TO TEN THOUSAND. PREVENTION AND IDEAL CLASSROOMS TO HAVE ONE SO THE OPPOSITE AS YOU STATED THAT WITH THE CBO THEY'RE GONNA BE IN CHARGE OF ALL THE. ON COMPILING THE ON MONDAY THAT DATABASE AND IT WOULD INCLUDE A TAX ID INFORMATION SO SECURITY INFORMATION. WATER THE DISADVANTAGE THAT YOU SEE I MEAN ASSUME THAT THE CBO WILL BE MORE THAN EQUIPPED TO TAKE CARE OF THIS. A STATE RUN SYSTEM. WELL I WOULDN'T SEE THAT ALL OF THAT INFORMATION IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE LONG. I'M NOT HERE TO JUSTIFY THE PRICING OF THE LOANS OR HOW THEY'RE ROLLED OVER I'M JUST HERE TO SAY THAT EVEN UNDER THIS CHART. IF ALL OF THOSE LOANS RIVER REFLECTED ANY CONSUMERS HISTORY A LENDER WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE THAT HISTORY AND SEE THAT THERE'S A RECORD OF PAYING THEM BACK. YOU CAN'T GO INTO A HIGHER LOAN LIKE. THREE DOT THREE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED TWENTY HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OR HIGHER WITHOUT A CREDIT HISTORY. IF YOU HAVE NO CREDIT HISTORY THOSE LENDERS ARE NOT GOING TO LOOK AT YOU THEY DON'T KNOW. YOUR HISTORY AND HOW YOU'RE GOING TO PAY BACK SO THIS WOULD ACTUALLY. THIS SHOULD PERFORM THE FUNCTION OF NOT ONLY. ASSESSING THE ISSUE OF WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY RD IS STACKING ALONE BUT ALSO THE ABILITY. PUMP THEM UP INTO OTHER LOAN PRODUCTS SO THAT THEY CAN QUALIFY WE WOULDN'T NEED TO OUR COLLECT ALL THE INFORMATION THAT THE STATE WOULD BE TO. COLLECT IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS DATABASE WORK WEB MAKING THAT WORK RIGHT NOW WITHOUT THAT IT. SHOULD WHAT WE NEED NOW. IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS WORK EFFECTIVELY AS THE AUTHORS PUT FORWARD IS MANDATORY REPORTING. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM BETWEEN NUMBERS. SEEING NONE IS THERE A MOTION SECOND. OF I CAN'T WILL MOVE MOTION THE SERGEANT. CAN I THE MOTIONS WELL I'VE HAULAGE AS MADAM CHAIR. AT YOUR PLEASURE PLEASE CLOSE AND I JUST I I WANTED TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT AND YOU KNOW WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT AND. OF WORK I INITIATED IN THIS PARTICULAR SPACE A THING TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ FLETCHER IS COMMENTS ABOUT HOW DO WE ALIGN AND I THINK OUR COMMITTEE. EASE AND YOU KNOW MYSLF WERE VERY INTERESTED IN MAKING SURE OF THAT THE THE BILLS THAT ARE MOVING FORWARD ARE ALIGNED AND THESE BILLS THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR WILL BE HEADED TO ASSEMBLY PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION IF IT GETS OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY.
