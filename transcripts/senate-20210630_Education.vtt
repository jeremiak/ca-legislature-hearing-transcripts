00:27:18.136 --> 00:27:20.271
DO TO. A CENTER BASED PROGRAM

00:27:20.338 --> 00:27:21.806
AS A FOIL THEY GONNA FAMILY

CHILD CARE HOME THEY CAN THAT

00:27:23.408 --> 00:27:24.476
THEY CAN CURRENTLY DO THAT AND

00:27:24.542 --> 00:27:26.511
WE'VE WE'RE CLARIFYING THAT. IN

00:27:26.578 --> 00:27:27.212
THE BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT'S

00:27:27.278 --> 00:27:31.282
THE CASE. FURTHER THAT WE HAVE

00:27:31.349 --> 00:27:34.185
NEXT DELIVERY FOR ZERO THREE

00:27:34.252 --> 00:27:35.754
THREE SEVEN AND THIS. BY THE

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.855
FACT THAT WE ALL OF US IN A

00:27:36.921 --> 00:27:38.890
MORE KIDS IN THE ALLEY EIGHT

00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:40.525
SYSTEM THROUGH STATE THIRTY

00:27:40.592 --> 00:27:42.427
THREE T. K. THERE'S ABOUT A

00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:43.028
HUNDRED THOUSAND CURRENT KIDS

00:27:43.094 --> 00:27:44.796
IN STATE PRESCHOOL SYSTEM. THAT

00:27:44.863 --> 00:27:47.232
WE CAN MOVE THOSE TO SERVE

00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:47.866
THREE THREE THREE SO THAT IS A

00:27:47.932 --> 00:27:49.401
MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM. PLUS

00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:50.869
FURTHER THROUGH THE BUDGET AND

00:27:50.935 --> 00:27:52.771
THE COMPANION BILL SB FIFTY.

00:27:52.837 --> 00:27:53.505
THERE'S GOING TO BE WRAPPED

00:27:53.571 --> 00:27:55.273
AROUND THESE PROVIDERS CANCER

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.674
OF THOSE FOUR YEAR OLDS THAT

00:27:56.741 --> 00:27:58.209
ARE ANTI K. SO WE THINK THERE

00:27:58.276 --> 00:28:01.413
ARE MULTIPLE. WAYS TO ADDRESS

00:28:01.479 --> 00:28:03.815
THAT ISSUE AS FAR AS- THE

00:28:03.882 --> 00:28:05.984
BUDGET. WITH THE WEEK WE VOTED

00:28:06.051 --> 00:28:07.052
ON THE BUDGET AS YOU KNOW A

00:28:07.118 --> 00:28:08.887
COUPLE DAYS AGO AND WE DID HAVE

00:28:08.953 --> 00:28:11.589
MONEY IN THEIR- TAX IRONICALLY

00:28:11.656 --> 00:28:13.758
TO PAY FOR RATE INCREASES BUT

00:28:13.825 --> 00:28:15.026
NOT FOR TEA CAKE IS TK'S AND-

00:28:15.093 --> 00:28:17.128
OUT YEAR. EXPENDITURE THIS JUST

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:18.463
THE START WE WERE JUST

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:20.231
AUTHORIZE IT. BUT THIS LOOMING

00:28:20.298 --> 00:28:21.900
TRAILER BILL WHICH WERE STILL

00:28:21.966 --> 00:28:22.767
NEGOTIATING THE SPEAKER IN THE

00:28:22.834 --> 00:28:24.402
PROTON. THIS IS OUR TOP

00:28:24.469 --> 00:28:25.970
PRIORITY. THERE ARE YOU KNOW

00:28:26.037 --> 00:28:26.704
ARE MESSING WITH THE GOVERNOR

00:28:26.771 --> 00:28:30.909
AS WE SPEAK- IT WILL HAVE IN

00:28:30.975 --> 00:28:32.510
THERE. THE RAY. AND WHICH WE

00:28:32.577 --> 00:28:34.179
CURRENTLY FIND OBJECT TO

00:28:34.245 --> 00:28:35.780
INCREASE THAT THE EIGHTY EIGHTY

00:28:35.847 --> 00:28:37.682
EIGHT PERCENTILE AND DRAMATIC

00:28:37.749 --> 00:28:38.616
OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN RATE

00:28:38.683 --> 00:28:41.986
INCREASES. AND WE HAVE. OVER

00:28:42.053 --> 00:28:42.887
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW. CHILD

00:28:42.954 --> 00:28:44.355
CARE AND STATE PRESCHOOL SLOTS

00:28:44.422 --> 00:28:46.458
SO. WE HAVE THESE COMPONENTS IN

00:28:46.524 --> 00:28:49.694
THERE. AND THE YOU KNOW I THINK

00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:50.962
BY THE TIME THIS BILL IS HEARD

00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:51.896
APPROPRIATIONS EARLIER IN THE

00:28:51.963 --> 00:28:53.898
SUMMER. SO I'LL BE A RESULT BUT

00:28:53.965 --> 00:28:55.166
A LOT OF THIS IS BASED UPON

00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:57.268
TRUST AND LASTLY. A BIG PART OF

00:28:57.335 --> 00:28:58.703
THE BILL AND WE'RE IS WE'RE

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.271
TALKING ABOUT THIS ONE YEAR OF

00:29:00.338 --> 00:29:01.339
IMPLEMENTATION TO MAKE SURE

00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:03.541
THAT WE- CAN ADDRESS THESE

00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:05.510
ISSUES AND MAKE WE CAN BE. A

00:29:05.577 --> 00:29:06.911
RISING BUT FOR EVERYBODY

00:29:06.978 --> 00:29:08.046
BECAUSE I THINK THE BIGGEST

00:29:08.113 --> 00:29:09.247
THING IS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:29:09.314 --> 00:29:11.282
INVESTING FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

00:29:11.349 --> 00:29:12.851
FOR LITTLE SKITS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:13.952
WITH PRIOR GOVERNORS THIS

00:29:14.018 --> 00:29:15.687
WASN'T AN OPPORTUNITY. SO THE

00:29:15.753 --> 00:29:17.122
FACT THAT WE'RE- TALKING ABOUT

00:29:17.188 --> 00:29:19.124
HOW WE CAN DO. A MASSIVE

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:20.692
INVESTMENT AND RE HAULING ARE

00:29:20.758 --> 00:29:23.061
YOU SEE PROGRAM. IS I THINK

00:29:23.128 --> 00:29:23.695

REFORM WHICH I CONTINUE TO BE

00:30:06.137 --> 00:30:07.705
APPALLED THAT IT WAS NOT IN THE

00:30:07.772 --> 00:30:09.073
BUDGET AFTER THESE ESSENTIAL

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:11.109
WORKERS WERE OPEN. THE ENTIRE

TIME DURING THE PANDEMIC CARING

00:30:12.877 --> 00:30:14.812
FOR OUR WORK MOST VULNERABLE

00:30:14.879 --> 00:30:16.781
PEOPLE WHICH ARE OUR CHILDREN

00:30:16.848 --> 00:30:19.984
IT WAS NOT IN THE BUDGET WE ARE

00:30:20.051 --> 00:30:21.019
WORKING ON IT. BUT IT.

00:30:21.085 --> 00:30:22.220
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN

00:30:22.287 --> 00:30:23.188
SHOULD BE THE LAST THING WE'RE

00:30:23.254 --> 00:30:24.822
WORKING ON GREAT REFORM IS THE

00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:25.657
FIRST THING WE SHOULD BE

00:30:25.723 --> 00:30:27.725
WORKING ON BECAUSE THAT COVERS

00:30:27.792 --> 00:30:29.127
MOST OF OUR CHILDREN BACK IT'S

00:30:29.194 --> 00:30:31.229
WORKING MOMS BACK TO WORK. WE

00:30:31.296 --> 00:30:33.531
KNOW THAT WE LOST THIRTY SEVEN

00:30:33.598 --> 00:30:34.599
HUNDRED CHILD CARE CENTERS

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:37.268

00:30:38.369 --> 00:30:40.438
IF WE DON'T DO RATE REFORM YES

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:41.639
I AGREE WITH YOU SOME REFORM

00:30:41.706 --> 00:30:42.974
HAS BEEN DONE BUT THAT'S FOR

00:30:43.041 --> 00:30:44.709
THE- WORKERS WHO ARE ORGANIZED

00:30:44.776 --> 00:30:46.945
THAT ONLY COVERS 20% OF CHILD

00:30:47.011 --> 00:30:48.313
CARE PROVIDERS IN THE STATE OF

00:30:48.379 --> 00:30:50.682
CALIFORNIA. SLOTS MY NUMBERS

00:30:50.748 --> 00:30:51.516
ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN

00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:53.851
YOURS I THINK FIVE HUNDRED

00:30:53.918 --> 00:30:54.352
THOUSAND I THINK YOU'RE

00:30:54.419 --> 00:30:56.221
CONFLATING THAT WITH. THE T. K.

00:30:56.287 --> 00:30:58.456
SLOTS TRUE FOUGHT. OR THE

00:30:58.523 --> 00:31:00.191
FOURTH OR FOURTH GRADER FOR

00:31:00.258 --> 00:31:03.094
CHILD CARE THERE ARE A HUNDRED

00:31:03.161 --> 00:31:04.095
TWENTY THOUSAND IN THE BUDGET

00:31:04.162 --> 00:31:05.964
MOVING TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.632
OVER THREE YEARS. AND JUST TO

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:08.433
PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE FOR

00:31:08.499 --> 00:31:10.268
PEOPLE BECAUSE I AT THAT SOUNDS

00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:12.036
LIKE A LOT BUT JUST IN SAN

00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:13.471
BERNARDINO COUNTY AND L. A.

00:31:13.538 --> 00:31:14.706
COUNTY THERE IS A NEED OF A

00:31:14.772 --> 00:31:15.807
HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND

00:31:15.873 --> 00:31:17.575
SLOTS. SO WE KNOW THAT OVER

00:31:17.642 --> 00:31:19.310
THREE YEARS OF TWO HUNDRED

00:31:19.377 --> 00:31:20.345
SEVEN THOUSAND SLOTS. WILL NOT

00:31:20.411 --> 00:31:22.714
BE ENOUGH TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:23.715
OUR CHILDREN AND OF WORKING

00:31:23.781 --> 00:31:26.184
PARENTS. SO I JUST REALLY HOPE

00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:27.719
THAT WE CAN GET TO A PLACE

00:31:27.785 --> 00:31:29.220
WHERE WE ARE NOT PRIORITIZING

00:31:29.287 --> 00:31:30.655
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T HELP OUR

00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:32.590
YOUNGEST LEARNERS. I THINK BACK

00:31:32.657 --> 00:31:37.095
WHEN MY GIRLS WERE LITTLE I.

00:31:37.161 --> 00:31:37.662
WENT BACK TO WORK WHEN THEY

00:31:37.729 --> 00:31:38.096
WERE TWO YEARS OLD.

00:31:38.162 --> 00:31:38.730
TRANSITIONAL WILL NOT HELP ME I

00:31:38.796 --> 00:31:40.098
WOULD HAVE STAY HOME FOR TWO

00:31:40.164 --> 00:31:41.733
MORE YEARS. WAITING FOR

00:31:41.799 --> 00:31:43.001
TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN IF

00:31:43.067 --> 00:31:44.502
THERE WAS NOT HEALTH CARE

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:45.436
AVAILABLE TO ME AND MY

00:31:45.503 --> 00:31:47.739
CHILDREN. SO LIKE I SAID I

00:31:47.805 --> 00:31:48.573
APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.275
AMENDMENTS. WE WILL I WILL BE

00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:53.611
I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WE CAN

00:31:53.678 --> 00:31:55.213
GET TO A POINT IN THIS BUDGET

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.481
WHERE WE ARE TAKING CARE OF THE

00:31:56.547 --> 00:31:58.483
WOMEN. THAT TOOK CARE OF OUR

00:31:58.549 --> 00:32:00.518
CHILDREN DURING THE PANDEMIC.

00:32:00.585 --> 00:32:03.221

ACHIEVE PERMANENT STATUS AFTER

PROBATIONARY PERIOD. THIS MEANS

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:37.542
THAT CERTIFICATED EMPLOYEES IN

00:34:43.681 --> 00:34:45.650

00:34:59.397 --> 00:35:01.399
CASE OF A DISMISSAL PERMANENT

00:35:01.466 --> 00:35:03.534
EMPLOYEE STATUS WOULD ALLOW

00:35:03.601 --> 00:35:05.636
EMPLOYEES TO REQUEST A HEARING

00:35:05.703 --> 00:35:06.771

DECIDE WHETHER THIS. THIS

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:13.411

00:35:13.478 --> 00:35:15.413
FURTHER A PERMANENT EMPLOYEE

THAT THE NEEDS FOR SERVICES IN

THE FUTURE ARE IN SECURE. THIS

00:35:37.735 --> 00:35:39.303
LACK OF PERMANENT STATUS IS

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:41.606
LEAD TO DISCRIMINATION

00:35:41.672 --> 00:35:43.975
RETALIATION AND FAVORITISM

00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:44.809

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:47.770
HAVE BEEN TEACHING. YOU KNOW.

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:49.405
TEN YEARS FOURTEEN YEARS TWENTY

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:51.340
YEARS AND NEVER GET PERMANENT

01:06:51.407 --> 01:06:54.977
STATUS SO I DON'T WANT TO.

01:06:55.044 --> 01:06:57.546
DIMINISH YOUR CONCERN CENTER

01:06:57.613 --> 01:07:00.349
DOLLY. ON SMALLER DISTRICTS BUT

01:07:00.416 --> 01:07:02.985
AT THE SAME TIME I DO THINK

01:07:03.052 --> 01:07:07.523
THAT IT IS- AND- YOU KNOW I'M

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:09.592
JUST A FULL JUSTIFIABLE

01:07:09.658 --> 01:07:11.494
SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN WHERE

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:14.363
WE ALLOW. TEACHERS TO TEACH

01:07:14.430 --> 01:07:16.799
WRAPS THE ROLE WORKING LIVES

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:19.335
AND BECAUSE OF THE IF THE-

01:07:19.402 --> 01:07:20.436
WHERE THEY ARE TEACHING AND

01:07:20.503 --> 01:07:21.937
WHAT SUBJECT THEY ARE TEACHING

01:07:22.004 --> 01:07:23.839
THEY NEVER GET PERMANENT STATUS

01:07:23.906 --> 01:07:26.075
SO THAT THAT IS WHY I HAVE

01:07:26.142 --> 01:07:29.712
INTRODUCED THIS BILL. TO I

01:07:29.779 --> 01:07:30.646
APPRECIATE THAT AND I

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:31.947
APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THERE

01:07:32.014 --> 01:07:33.983
ARE OBVIOUSLY WE HEARD

01:07:34.049 --> 01:07:35.651
TESTIMONY FROM THE TEACHERS

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:38.554
THAT YOU TALK ABOUT. BUT THE

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:39.555
ADMINISTRATION STILL HAS TO RUN

01:07:39.622 --> 01:07:41.357
THE SCHOOL AND START TO PROVIDE

01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:42.558
THE CLASSES IN THE IN THE

01:07:42.625 --> 01:07:43.893
ABILITY BILL TO AND WHEN YOU

01:07:43.959 --> 01:07:46.328
HAVE A VERY SMALL. RULE SCHOOL

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:47.696
DISTRICT IT HAS ALL THESE

01:07:47.763 --> 01:07:48.697
MANDATES THAT THEY HAVE TO

01:07:48.764 --> 01:07:50.699
MEET. THERE IS NO FLEXIBILITY

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:51.801
AT SOME POINT THERE'S NO THIS

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:53.803
IS TAKING AWAY THE ABILITY HAVE

01:07:53.869 --> 01:07:55.137
FLEXIBILITY I'M NOT DISCOUNTING

01:07:55.204 --> 01:07:58.240
THAT. LARGE SCHOOLS SCHOOLS CAN

01:07:58.307 --> 01:07:59.442
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT

01:07:59.508 --> 01:08:01.744
BECAUSE THEY HAVE MORE STUDENTS

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:03.412
MORE ADA BUT WHEN YOU'RE- IT.

01:08:03.479 --> 01:08:06.315
REPRESENTING UP A WHOLE BUNCH

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:08.017
OF VERY SMALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:09.952
THAT ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE. THE

01:08:10.019 --> 01:08:12.087
STUDENTS WITH A BROAD. AMOUNT

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:14.056
OF MANDATES IT'S THIS THIS BILL

01:08:14.123 --> 01:08:15.124
IS GOING TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:16.225
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO BE ABLE

01:08:16.292 --> 01:08:17.593
TO PROVIDE THAT AND THAT'S THAT

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:19.662
THAT'S THAT'S WHY THERE IS. A

01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:22.097
CAR ABOUT- THERE IS HOPE.

01:08:22.164 --> 01:08:24.667
BILITY TO HAVE THIS. TWO

01:08:24.733 --> 01:08:26.135
HUNDRED FIFTY OR LESS NOT IN

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:27.069
THAT SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:28.537
PROVIDE THE SERVICES THAT YOU

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:29.472
NEED WITHIN THE BUDGET THAT

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:31.273
THEY ARE. TRYING TO BALANCE AT

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:33.609
THE SAME TIME. AND SO I DON'T

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:34.777
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS GOING TO

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:35.945
HELP THE SITUATION I THINK IT'S

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:36.979
GONNA MAKE IT WORSE WHEN THEY

01:08:37.046 --> 01:08:39.415
HAVE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:08:39.482 --> 01:08:39.982
HOW THEY'RE GOING TO PROVIDE

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:41.517
THOSE COURSES. MORE THOSE

01:08:41.584 --> 01:08:42.852
STUDENTS WITH THE NEEDS THAT

01:08:42.918 --> 01:08:46.188
THEY HAVE WHEN THEY'RE LOCKING

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:47.289
WHEN WE'RE LOCKING THEM INTO.

01:08:47.356 --> 01:08:49.458
NEP THAT THEY THEN HAVE TO TRY

01:08:49.525 --> 01:08:51.093
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BALANCE

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:52.228
AND THAT'S THAT'S THE PART

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:54.463
THAT. IS THE FRUSTRATION FOR ME

01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:57.433
ON MANY ISSUES IN GOVERNMENT IS

01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:00.236
THAT WE SEE THAT. WE JUST

01:09:00.302 --> 01:09:01.971
BLANKET LEE COVER AND WE DON'T

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:03.639
DIG INTO THE FACT THAT THERE'S

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:05.374
A ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:06.809
PROVIDE THE ALL THESE MANDATES

01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:09.111
AND IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:11.547
ON SEVERAL LEVELS. ESPECIALLY

01:09:11.614 --> 01:09:12.948
FOR SCHOOLS WHERE THEY'RE AT A

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:14.783
IS VERY LOW AND THEY DON'T HAVE

01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:17.319
AND THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES TO

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:19.788
MEET. THE HI TERRY THAT THEY

01:09:19.855 --> 01:09:21.023
HAVE TO MEET SO FOR I'M NOT

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:22.024
GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:23.726
BILL TODAY I'M HOPEFUL. THAT

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:26.228
THERE IS SOME SOLUTION THAT

01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:27.863
WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE WHERE

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.031
YOU HAVE TWENTY FIVE YEARS I

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:30.633
DID NOT HEAR THOSE PEOPLE

01:09:30.699 --> 01:09:31.534
COMING FROM OUR DISTRICT I

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.135
HEARD IT COMING FROM VRY

01:09:33.202 --> 01:09:36.405
POPULATED AREAS. THAT HAVE A

01:09:36.472 --> 01:09:37.606
LOT OF STUDENTS IN THOSE AREAS

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:41.110
SO FOR THE VERY EXTREME RULE.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.245
IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT.

01:09:43.312 --> 01:09:45.915
SOMETIMES DON'T EVEN HAVE THE-

01:09:45.981 --> 01:09:48.951
FOLKS THAT. ARE EDUCATED TO BE

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:50.252
EVEN WHICH TEACHES CLASSES

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:51.086
TRYING TO WORK THROUGH THOSE

01:09:51.153 --> 01:09:52.521
PROCESSES SO FOR THOSE REASONS

01:09:52.588 --> 01:09:53.489
I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR

01:09:53.556 --> 01:09:54.890

01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:15.945
SMALL DISTRICTS- YOU YOU HAVE

TALK ABOUT RETENTION AND- OF

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:33.929
COURSE THIS BILL THIS. DRESS IS

01:10:33.996 --> 01:10:35.464
A RETENTION WHICH IS TRYING TO

01:10:35.531 --> 01:10:37.466
HOW DO YOU RETAIN HIGH SCHOOL

01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:38.634
TEACHERS BUT THERE'S ONE ISSUE

01:10:38.701 --> 01:10:40.402
THAT'S BROUGHT BY OPPOSITION IS

01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:41.136
HOPING THAT YOU COULD PERHAPS

01:10:41.203 --> 01:10:44.607

01:10:44.673 --> 01:10:46.442
COURSES LIKE FEELS THE LEARNING

TO TRY TO MEET THE DEMAND- SO

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:55.918
THOSE I THINK THE TESTIMONY.

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:56.518

THE AND DAY AND SO THEY SAID

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:08.163
PROBLEM WOULD BE IF WE DECIDED

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:10.099
SOLELY BY SENIORITY. WE MAY NOT

01:11:10.165 --> 01:11:11.300

SPEAK TO- SO I ACTUALLY AGREE

01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:32.388
THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO TRY TO

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:34.023
GET. THESE TEACHERS OFF

01:11:34.089 --> 01:11:35.224

RELEASED IF- THEIR COURSE WAS

01:13:10.986 --> 01:13:14.223
NOT GOING TO BE BE OFFERED- AND

01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:17.292

01:14:13.515 --> 01:14:16.084
BILL BUT I. AM ACTUALLY I THINK

01:14:16.151 --> 01:14:17.152
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP A

01:14:17.219 --> 01:14:19.555
LITTLE BIT FROM TO YOUR POINT

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:21.557
SENATE ALL THE ABOUT THE MONEY-

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:23.792
THIS YEAR IN THIS BUDGET LCF

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:25.894
THE FUNDING IS GOING IS.

01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:27.029
THROUGH THE ROOF SO THERE WILL

01:14:27.095 --> 01:14:29.431
BE MORE MONEY. EVERY DISTRICT

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:31.333
BIG OR SMALL SO I THINK THAT

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:33.302
GOES TO PART OF YOUR ISSUE HOPE

01:14:33.368 --> 01:14:34.636
MAYBE THAT HELPS A LITTLE BIT.

01:14:34.703 --> 01:14:37.306
AND TO YOUR POINT- CENTER PAN

01:14:37.372 --> 01:14:39.408
CURRENT LAW ALREADY ALLOWS. FOR

01:14:39.474 --> 01:14:41.109
LAYOFFS BASED ON OTHER THINGS

01:14:41.176 --> 01:14:43.045
OTHER THAN SENIORITY SUCH AS

01:14:43.111 --> 01:14:45.347
PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS SO SENIORITY

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:47.049
CERTAINLY COULD BE CONSIDERED

01:14:47.115 --> 01:14:49.017
BUT IT IS NOT THE SOLE FACTOR

01:14:49.084 --> 01:14:50.185
IN DETERMINING WHETHER SOMEONE

01:14:50.252 --> 01:14:52.120
SHOULD BE LAID OFF I HOPE MAYBE

01:14:52.187 --> 01:14:52.955
THAT HELPS BOTH OF YOU A LITTLE

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:55.624
BIT. NINE NINE MAY THOUGH YES

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:56.825

01:15:02.464 --> 01:15:03.031

SITUATION THEY'LL BE STUCK WITH

01:15:15.277 --> 01:15:18.680
THIS. LAW NOT. BEING FLEXIBLE.

01:15:18.747 --> 01:15:19.781

01:37:13.961 --> 01:37:14.828
WHO HAVE TO SIGN OFF ON THE

01:37:14.895 --> 01:37:16.864
PROGRAM IN TERMS OF THE QUALITY

01:37:16.931 --> 01:37:18.933
OF THE PROGRAM. YES THIS OF THE

01:37:18.999 --> 01:37:22.203
CTC THE TEACHERS CREIGHTON-

01:37:22.269 --> 01:37:23.938
APPROVES THESE PROGRAMS AND

01:37:24.004 --> 01:37:25.773
WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS JUST

01:37:25.839 --> 01:37:28.976
ALLOW THEM. TO CONSIDER- A

01:37:29.043 --> 01:37:30.544
SCHOOL NURSE CREDENTIAL PROGRAM

01:37:30.611 --> 01:37:32.313
THAT IS BASED OUT OF AN ALLEY

01:37:32.379 --> 01:37:34.848
A- WHILE THIS BILL IS SPONSORED

01:37:34.915 --> 01:37:37.818
BY LOS ANGELES UNIFIED- WE HAVE

01:37:37.885 --> 01:37:40.421
OTHER- COUNTY. OFFICES OF

01:37:40.487 --> 01:37:42.022
EDUCATION AND SUPPORT INCLUDING

01:37:42.089 --> 01:37:44.425
HUMBOLDT COUNTY SHASTA COUNTY

01:37:44.491 --> 01:37:47.061
RIVERSIDE COUNTY I DON'T KNOW

01:37:47.127 --> 01:37:49.296
IF THEY HAVE PLANS TO DO THIS

01:37:49.363 --> 01:37:53.400
BUT THEY HAVE SUPPORTED THIS

01:37:53.467 --> 01:37:55.536
IS SO I THINK ONE OF THINGS I'M

01:37:55.603 --> 01:37:56.637
CONCERNED ABOUT SOME SORT OF

01:37:56.704 --> 01:37:59.406
COMPOUND IS SORT OF CONFLATING

01:37:59.473 --> 01:38:01.508
A COUPLE THINGS SO YES SCHOOL

01:38:01.575 --> 01:38:03.544
NURSES PRACTICE IN SCHOOLS AND

01:38:03.611 --> 01:38:06.013
AN EDUCATIONAL SETTING- BUT

01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:07.715
THEIR MAIN ROLE THERE IS

01:38:07.781 --> 01:38:10.417
ACTUALLY. HEALTH I MEAN THE

01:38:10.484 --> 01:38:12.253
HEALTH SERVICES NOT THE

01:38:12.319 --> 01:38:14.555
EDUCATION SO. WELL CERTAINLY

01:38:14.622 --> 01:38:15.789
SOMETIMES SCHOOL NURSES CAN BE

01:38:15.856 --> 01:38:16.624
INVOLVED IN TEACHING THINGS

01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:19.660
STUDENTS AND SO FORTH. SO I

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:20.628
THINK THE ON THE COMMISSION

01:38:20.694 --> 01:38:22.229
TEACHER CREDENTIALING WHICH IS

01:38:22.296 --> 01:38:24.131
VERY FOCUSED ON EDUCATORS AND

01:38:24.198 --> 01:38:25.833
EDUCATION STANDARDS WHICH IS

01:38:25.899 --> 01:38:27.835
THEIR ROLE NOT SURE IS THE

01:38:27.901 --> 01:38:29.236
RIGHT BODY BECAUSE IT'S NOT

01:38:29.303 --> 01:38:30.371
REALLY ADDRESSING THE HEALTH

01:38:30.437 --> 01:38:32.006
PART SIDE OF THINGS THEY'RE NOT

01:38:32.072 --> 01:38:33.507
EXPERTS AND HEALTHCARE EXPERTS

01:38:33.574 --> 01:38:35.175
IN EDUCATION. EDUCATIONAL

01:38:35.242 --> 01:38:38.512
STANDARDS- A JUST TELL YOU FROM

01:38:38.579 --> 01:38:40.347
MY EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH

01:38:40.414 --> 01:38:42.082
SCHOOL NURSES- AS A MEDICAL

01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:44.818
CONSULTANT. SCHOOL NURSES HAVE

01:38:44.885 --> 01:38:46.854
TO TAKE CARE OF FAIRLY CAN END

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:48.255
UP TAKING CARE VERY COMPLEX

01:38:48.322 --> 01:38:49.623
PATIENTS SO WHAT HAPPENS IS

01:38:49.690 --> 01:38:51.025
THAT YOU HAVE A CHILD THAT OF

01:38:51.091 --> 01:38:52.159
COURSE EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT

01:38:52.226 --> 01:38:52.960
EVERY CHILD HAS A RIGHT TO AN

01:38:53.027 --> 01:38:54.762
EDUCATION. SO THEY'RE IN THE

01:38:54.828 --> 01:38:55.696
SCHOOL DEPRIVE IN SPECIAL

01:38:55.763 --> 01:39:00.034
EDUCATION. THEY MAY NEED

01:39:00.100 --> 01:39:01.101
SOMEONE TO FEED THEM THROUGH A

01:39:01.168 --> 01:39:02.936
G. TWO MAY NEED TO HAVE OTHERS-

01:39:03.003 --> 01:39:04.238
K. AND SO FORTH. AND FOR WHEN I

01:39:04.305 --> 01:39:05.172
WAS WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL

01:39:05.239 --> 01:39:06.073
DISTRICT WORKING THE SCHOOL

01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:07.708
NURSES OFTENTIMES THAT WAS.

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:09.510
WHAT I DID WAS. TRY TO GIVE

01:39:09.576 --> 01:39:11.478
THEM ADVICE ON HOW TO MANAGE

01:39:11.545 --> 01:39:13.347
THESE PATIENTS BECAUSE-

01:39:13.414 --> 01:39:14.948
ESSENTIALLY THE SCHOOL NURSE

01:39:15.015 --> 01:39:16.216
THAT IS FAIRLY INDEPENDENT I

01:39:16.283 --> 01:39:17.885
MEAN FACTORED THE EXPERT SO

01:39:17.951 --> 01:39:19.586
WE'LL BUT TIMES. THE OTHER

01:39:19.653 --> 01:39:21.188
STAFF GO TO THEM AND ASK THEM

01:39:21.255 --> 01:39:22.289
HOW HOW TO HANDLE DIFFERENT

01:39:22.356 --> 01:39:23.290
DIFFERENT HEALTH ISSUES SO IT'S

01:39:23.357 --> 01:39:24.925
NOT SIMPLY- WHICH OUT AS A

01:39:24.992 --> 01:39:26.827
HEADACHE HERE'S- A TYLENOL AND

01:39:26.894 --> 01:39:28.329
I WAS WATCHING MY OFFICE AND WE

01:39:28.395 --> 01:39:29.430
ACTUALLY CAN DO FAIRLY

01:39:29.496 --> 01:39:30.798
SOPHISTICATED THEY HAVE TO. THE

01:39:30.864 --> 01:39:31.498
HANDLE FAIRLY SOPHISTICATED

01:39:31.565 --> 01:39:35.903
THINGS. AND MY CONCERN IS THAT-

01:39:35.969 --> 01:39:37.371
WERE GOING TO CREATE A

01:39:37.438 --> 01:39:42.509
SITUATION WHERE- CERTAINLY. YOU

01:39:42.576 --> 01:39:43.577
KNOW THAT NURSES- WHO ARE INTO

01:39:43.644 --> 01:39:45.713
IN DOING- ARE VERY CAREFUL WHY

01:39:45.779 --> 01:39:46.980
APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENT THAT

01:39:47.047 --> 01:39:48.115
WAS TAKEN TO RELEASE REQUIRED

01:39:48.182 --> 01:39:49.983
BACHELORS DEGREE. BUT IN FACT

01:39:50.050 --> 01:39:51.485
MANY SCHOOL NURSES ACTUALLY DO

01:39:51.552 --> 01:39:54.488
HAVE MASTERS DEGREES BECAUSE-

01:39:54.555 --> 01:39:57.491
THE AMOUNT OF- SKILL THAT IT

01:39:57.558 --> 01:39:59.993
TAKES ACTUALLY MANAGE THESE.

01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:01.261
SOMEWHAT COMPLEX PATIENTS AND

01:40:01.328 --> 01:40:02.663
ALSO TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:40:02.730 --> 01:40:04.398
ASPECT AS WELL BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:40:04.465 --> 01:40:05.466
KIND OF LIKE THE PUBLIC HEALTH

01:40:05.532 --> 01:40:07.000
PERSON FOR THE SCHOOLS THAT FOR

01:40:07.067 --> 01:40:08.001
THE SCHOOL AND SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:40:08.068 --> 01:40:08.836
ARE CONFLICTING MULTIPLE

01:40:08.902 --> 01:40:10.337
SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

01:40:10.404 --> 01:40:13.774
ENOUGH FOR. SCHOOL NURSES. SO I

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:15.943
AM CONCERNED THAT THIS- THAT BY

01:40:16.009 --> 01:40:18.746
HAVING THE CTC AND I ALSO MAKE

01:40:18.812 --> 01:40:20.714
NOTE THAT- THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:40:20.781 --> 01:40:22.683
TESTIFYING FOR WERE LIKE HUMAN

01:40:22.750 --> 01:40:24.718
RESOURCES ADMINISTRATOR CITING

01:40:24.785 --> 01:40:25.686
HERE PEOPLE FROM THE SCHOOL

01:40:25.753 --> 01:40:27.388
HEALTH COMMUNITY SAYING HEY

01:40:27.454 --> 01:40:29.223
THIS IS. THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY

01:40:29.289 --> 01:40:29.990
TO GO ABOUT GETTING MORE SCHOOL

01:40:30.057 --> 01:40:33.127
NURSES- BY HERE IS THAT FROM

01:40:33.193 --> 01:40:34.261
THE SCHOOL HEALTH COMMUNITY

01:40:34.328 --> 01:40:35.596
THAT WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:40:35.662 --> 01:40:36.797
THIS BECAUSE WE'RE CONCERNED

01:40:36.864 --> 01:40:38.432
ABOUT THE STANDARDS AND- ARE WE

01:40:38.499 --> 01:40:39.867
GONNA HAVE SCHOOL NURSES NOW I

01:40:39.933 --> 01:40:41.034
UNDERSTAND WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:40:41.101 --> 01:40:41.902
SCHOOL NURSES WE HAVE SCHOOL

01:40:41.969 --> 01:40:42.803
STAFF EVEN THROWN AT THIS

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:44.104
POSITION BUT SCHOOL NURSES FROM

01:40:44.171 --> 01:40:48.075
THE POSITION WHERE. THEY THE

01:40:48.142 --> 01:40:51.345
WHERE WE'RE BASICALLY- HILLS.

01:40:51.412 --> 01:40:53.347
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE W. F.

01:40:53.414 --> 01:40:54.681
THREE DIFFICULT POSITION

01:40:54.748 --> 01:40:58.018
BECAUSE- AGAIN THE STANDARDS

01:40:58.085 --> 01:40:59.253
ARE APPLIED TO THEM ARE NOT

01:40:59.319 --> 01:41:00.554
REALLY STANDARDS RELATED

01:41:00.621 --> 01:41:02.055
NURSING THEIR STANDARDS RELATED

01:41:02.122 --> 01:41:04.591
TO. YOU KNOW EDUCATION- AND SO

01:41:04.658 --> 01:41:05.692
WHILE THEY ARE PRACTICING AN

01:41:05.759 --> 01:41:07.294
EDUCATIONAL SETTING I THINK

01:41:07.361 --> 01:41:09.062
THAT I WOULD PREFER THAT IF WE

01:41:09.129 --> 01:41:11.498
WOULD HAVE AN ENTITY. THAT WAS

01:41:11.565 --> 01:41:14.201
FOCUSED ON NURSING. BE THE ONE

01:41:14.268 --> 01:41:15.436
THAT HAS TO SIGN OFF ON

01:41:15.502 --> 01:41:17.438
WHATEVER PROGRAM IS. YOU KNOW

01:41:17.504 --> 01:41:19.440
SUFFICIENT AND SO I GET THAT

01:41:19.506 --> 01:41:21.375
YOU DID HAVE LANGUAGE SAYING

01:41:21.442 --> 01:41:22.709
WELL THE CDC HAS TO ON THE ON

01:41:22.776 --> 01:41:23.977
THE PRICE THE SAME STANDARDS

01:41:24.044 --> 01:41:24.845
BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY IN A

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:26.447
GOOD PLACE TO INTERPRET WHETHER

01:41:26.513 --> 01:41:27.981
DISPERSED THAT THAT OTHER.

01:41:28.048 --> 01:41:29.850
PROGRAM ACTUALLY. HAD THE RIGHT

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:33.053
STANDARDS ARE NOT A- NURSING-

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:35.155
AS A STANDARDS ORGANIZATION

01:41:35.222 --> 01:41:36.457
WRITER AND EDUCATIONAL

01:41:36.523 --> 01:41:39.359
STANDARDS ORGANIZATION. SO

01:41:39.426 --> 01:41:41.428
PERHAPS- SO ANYWAY I SO I DO

01:41:41.495 --> 01:41:42.663
HAVE MY CONCERNS I DON'T KNOW

01:41:42.729 --> 01:41:43.831

AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

01:41:50.604 --> 01:41:53.340
FACT THAT. THE THAT. THE CDC IS

01:41:53.407 --> 01:41:55.175
THE MAIN BACKSTOPS TO BE SURE

01:41:55.242 --> 01:41:56.810
THAT THESE NURSES MEET THE

01:41:56.877 --> 01:42:00.113
STANDARD AND- AND SO. FORTY ONE
