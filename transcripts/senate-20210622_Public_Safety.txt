WE ARE MARK SUPPER AB FIVE OH SIX REPORT ON IN ORDER. WE'RE HERE. SOME WOMAN GONZALEZ- WHEN YOU'RE READY YOU CAN PRESENT AB FIVE OH SIX. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB FIVE OH SIX WOULD REQUIRE YOU SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPLEMENT SPECIFIED CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION MEASURES AND REQUIRE SPECIFIED VOLUNTEERS OF YOUTH SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. THAT'S IT IN PRINT TO BE MANDATED REPORTERS- IN RECENT YEARS I AM SEEN AS IN PRINT BECAUSE I'M- GOING TO SUGGEST- AN AMENDMENT THAT WILL HOPEFULLY- RELIEVE THE STRESS OF THE NOW SAYS THAT I FIND. INACCURATE BUT NONE THE LESS WE CAN WORK ON THIS TOGETHER- IN RECENT YEARS INCREASE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND MEDIA ATTENTION HYTNER WEIRDNESS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE IN SCHOOLS CHURCHES SPORTS TEAMS AND YOU SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS FOR INSTANCE OVER NINETY THOUSAND CLAIMS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST THE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA EVIDENCE SHOWED INTERNAL FILES TRACKING IDENTITIES AND CRIMES OF HUNDREDS OF PERPETRATORS WHO WERE SCOUT LEADERS OR OTHER ADULT VOLUNTEERS. HOWEVER SUSPECTED ABUSE WITHIN THE BOY SCOUTS WAS OFTEN NOT REPORTED AN ORGANIZATION CONTINUALLY FAILED TO MAKE MORE PREVENTATIVE MEASURES SIMILARLY OVER TWO HUNDRED CLAIMS OF CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE WERE FILED AGAINST THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB WHICH FAILED TO REPORT ABUSE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND IN SOME CASES FAILED TO RUN BACKGROUND CHECKS ON STAFF DESPITE INTERNAL POLICIES TO DO SO. MANY YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS HAVE ADOPTED INTERNAL BEST PRACTICES THEY LACK UNIFORM STANDARDS AND ACCOUNTABILITY. ADDITIONALLY THE ADULT VOLUNTEERS WITH THE CLOSEST CONTACT WITH YOUTH ARE OFTEN NOT MANDY RICK REPORTERS ABOUT. OF THE ABUSE AB FIVE OR SIX WOULD CREATE BASIC MINIMUM STANDARDS TO PREVENT CHILD ABUSE NEWS ORGANIZATIONS. WOULD INCLUDE BACKGROUND SCREENING. REQUIRED TRAINING ON CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT IDENTIFICATION AND REPORTING AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION POLICIES SUCH AS HAVING TO MANDATED REPORTERS PRESENT WHEN CONTACT WITH CHILDREN TOOK STEPS. TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE. AB FIVE OR SIX WOULD ALSO REQUIRE SPECIFIED REGULAR ADULT VOLUNTEERS WHO HAVE DIRECT CONTACT OR SUPERVISION CHILDREN BECOME MANDATE REPORTERS. A SYSTEM WHICH THE LEGISLATORS CONTINUALLY AFFIRMED AS AN IMPORTANT POLICY TO PREVENT ABUSE AND ABUSE AND NEGLECT AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY. BEFORE I GO TO MY- MY WITNESSES I JUST I WANT TO START BY ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CONCERNS BROUGHT UP. IN THE ANALYSIS. AND BY WHAT IS SUDDENLY OPPOSITION DESPITE NOT HAVING ANY IN THE ASSEMBLY PASSING WITH BIPARTISAN UNANIMOUS SUPPORT WE NOW HAVE- APPARENTLY THE ACLU HAS DECIDED THEY DON'T LIKE MANDATED REPORTERS AND ALTHOUGH THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM DOES OBVIOUSLY HAVE PROBLEMS THIS IS A NEW POSITION AND SO I'M LEFT TO TRY TO DEAL WITH A SEVEN OPPOSITION AND SWELL OF OPPOSITION THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO. GEN UP SO THIS IS WHAT. I'M SUGGESTING WE DO WITH THIS BILL. FOR NOW. CONTINUE TO REQUIRE THE VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE. IN CONTACT WITH CHILDREN BY FOR EIGHT SIXTEEN HOURS PER MONTH OR THIRTY TWO HOURS PER YEAR TO TAKE THE TRAINING ON IDENTIFYING CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT BUT NOT GIVE THEM THE LEGAL MANDATE TO BE A MANDATORY REPORTER MAKE THEM GO THROUGH THE TRAINING SO THEY UNDERSTAND BETTER HOW TO IDENTIFY AND ADDS WE HOPEFULLY- ALLEVIATE THE- CONCERNS. OF THE ACLU IN THE FUTURE- PERHAPS REAP RETURNED TO WHAT- THE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE OR TO ANY KIND OF TRAINING NECESSARY TO CREATE THE MANDATE REPORTERS- WE WILL ACCEPT. CONTINUE THE STRENGTHENING OF THE BACKGROUND CHECK- UNDER EIGHTY FIVE OH SIX THAT WAS AT. IT SO IT WILL IT WILL APPLY AT IT ASKS IN THE ANALYSIS WHO APPLIES TO I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY CLEAR ADMINISTRATORS EMPLOYEES VOLUNTEERS WHO- ARE IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH KIDS- WE WILL- INSURE. HOPEFULLY WITH THIS THAT A LOT OF THE OPPOSITION'S REMOVED DID THAT MAKE SENSE I'M SORRY FOR BRINGING THIS LAST MINUTE BUT IT I WOULD WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH REAP ACTUALLY VOTING FOR IT AND CONTINUING TO VOTE FOR IT- WITHOUT. A TOTALLY GOT IN THE BILL. YOUR NOT TAKING TO SUGGEST AMENDMENTS THAT WE- A FOURTH I DON'T THINK OF THOSE- CUTTING THE BILL I JUST THINK IT OUT FOR. BETTER CLARIFICATION AGAIN HAVING- BACKGROUND CHECKS- VIA THE DEPARTMENT OF. JUSTICE AND REDUCE THE SCOPE OF LAUNCHERS ADDED AS A MANDATE REPORTERS- THE FIRST AMENDMENT ABSOLUTELY I'M ACTUALLY GOING FURTHER THAN THE SECOND AMENDMENT. THE SECOND AMENDMENT WOULD LIMIT THE SCOPE TO VOLUNTEERS THAT WEREN'T- DETENT VOLUNTEERS BECOME MANDATE REPORTERS IF THEY WEREN'T IN THE PRESENCE OF ANOTHER MAN OF AN EMPLOYEE THAT'S MANDATED REPORTER RATHER THAN. THEN CREATE THAT TEAR IN PEOPLE ARE STILL CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING ADDITIONAL MANDATED REPORTERS I SAID FINE THEY WON'T BE MANDATED REPORTERS BUT THEY WILL ALL THESE VOLUNTEERS WILL HAVE TO TAKE THE TRAINING. SURE WINNER SCORED FROM. THANK YOU I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU WORKING ON A MANDATED REPORTER ISSUE BUT THAT'S A THAT'S A CLARIFICATION SO IF YOU'RE A VOLUNTEER AND YOU REPORT TO A MANDATED REPORTER IS THAT ENOUGH THAT YOU'RE NOT MANDATED OR IS IT THAT YOU HAVE TO BE IN THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE SO LET'S SAY YOU'RE NO LONGER WILL BE MANDATED REPORTERS WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THE VOLUNTEERS WHO SERVE. OVER- SIXTEEN HOURS. A MONTH OR THIRTY TWO HOURS A YEAR WILL HAVE TO BE TRAINED ON HOW TO THAT TRAINING. GOT TO TAKE ONE OF THE TRAINING ON IDENTIFYING CHILD ABUSE NEGLECT IN AND CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ASSAULT. APPRECIATE YOUR FLEXIBILITY ON THE- FOR NOW THIS YEAR. I JUST WANT TO SAY ALSO APPRECIATE BECAUSE YOU- BURKE CRISTINA GARCIA GARCIA BILL FROM LAST YEAR WHICH WE ALL YOU SUPPORT WE SUPPORT IT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN MANDATED REPORTING- ELIMINATE SOME OF THE INEQUITIES IN TERMS OF ALL TO BE TO USE A THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THAT I THINK THAT FIXED A BIG FLAW IN THE MANDATED REPORTING SYSTEM. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. CENTERS SKINNER. THANK YOU- CHAIR- I DON'T WANT TO- SUPERSEDE THE CHAIR BUT IT SEEMS SOUNDS LIKE WHAT THE AUTHOR IS SUGGESTING MEETS THE ANALYSIS WAS TRYING TO ACHIEVE- I'M CLEAR ON WHAT SHE SUGGESTED THAT OKAY SO- JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL HAD THE SAME UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE AUTHOR WAS SUGGESTING. THANK YOU. CENTER TROUBLED YOUR QUESTION. JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY- THE NEW IMMENSELY CAME THROUGH ART IF THEY COME AFTER YESTERDAY AFTERNOON. THE NEW THAT YOU'RE DRESSING TODAY DON'T THE SCANNING- AND I'M SORRY FOR ANY CONFUSION HI I AM USED TO ASSEMBLY ANALYSIS WHICH HAVE THE- REQUIRED AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS SO I- WAS TOLD THAT THE CONSULTANT DID NOT WANT TO ACCEPT THEM AS COMMITTEE ANALYSISPART COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ORIGINALLY THAT WE HAD NEGOTIATED. AN APPARENTLY THEY CAME THROUGH YESTERDAY AS COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS- AT THE SAME TIME IS I WORKED WITH THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND- SOME STAFF TO US TO REDUCE THE- BILL IN OTHER WAYS. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. YEAH I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT EIGHT FIVE WHEN I SUPPORT THE BILL I THINK IT'S A IT'S A GOOD BILL IT'S MOVING FORWARD ON THE RIGHT PROTECT ON THE RIGHT PATH TO PROTECTING OUR YOUTH THAT- I'M VOTING FOR WHAT I THINK. WAS WHAT I AGREE TO. AT THIS. STAGE IS WHAT MAKES YOUR- MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THE CONSULTANT DID NOT WANT TO OFFER UP AMENDMENTS BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THERE MIGHT BE AMENDMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE I'M AS WE PRESENTED AND SO WE WORKED ON AMENDMENTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE ANALYSIS. HELLO WHILE WE'RE STILL HAVING DISCUSSIONS WILL MOVE TO THE PREMIER WITNESSES SUPPORT WILL GIVE EACH CHART THREE MINUTES WE HAVE- SUPPORT BY. DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ARE THEY ON THE LINE YOU'RE A PRIMARY WITNESS. MISTER MODERATOR CAN YOU QUEUE UP. THE PRIMARY WITNESS AND SUPPORT WILL GO WITH THEM THREE MINUTES OF TESTIMONY. YES GOOD MORNING SURE BRADFORD AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MICHAEL MARTINEZ SENIOR DEPUTY COMMISSIONER LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR HERE ON BEHALF OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER RICARDO LARA AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. AS A SPONSOR OF THIS BILL WE WOULD LIKE TO REALLY THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN OFFERING THIS MEASURE. ASSUMING AB FIVE OH SIX THIS YEAR BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC HAS MADE YOU FEEL MORE ISOLATED THAN EVER MAKING THEM GRAVITATE TO YOUTH SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS AS THEY TACKLE. THEIR ANXIETY AND STRESS BUT ALSO MAKING THEM MORE VULNERABLE TO CHILD ABUSE. PUBLICATION ACROSS OUR NATION HAS ALSO SHED LIGHT ON CHILD ABUSE THAT HAS OCCURRED IN SCHOOLS CHURCHES SPORTS TEAMS OUTDOOR SCOUTING CLUBS. AND YOUTH ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE OF HOW YOUTH SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS ARE DISTINCTLY STRUCTURED. VOLUNTEERS ALONE ARE OFTEN THE ONES SPENDING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME WITH CHILDREN. AB FIVE ZERO SIX OF THE BILL NEEDED NOW. TO MANDATE OUR STATE MANY YOUTH SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPLEMENT BASELINE CHILD ABUSE. PREVENTION MEASURES INCLUDING MANDATORY BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ALL ADMINISTRATORS EMPLOYEES AND VOLUNTEERS AS WELL AS THE INCREASE TRAINING REPORTING AS DESCRIBED BY OUR AUTHOR JUST NOW. INCLUDING COMMISSIONER LATTA BELIEVES THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM ABUSE AND NEGLECT. OUR CONCERN THAT CHILD FATALITIES CAUSED BY CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT HAVE DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH NUMBERS FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WHEN COMPARED TO THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. AND FOR CHILDREN WHO DO SURVIVE AS WE KNOW THE FACTS OF CHILD ABUSE NEGLECT CAN LEAD TO A WIDE RANGE OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES IN ADULTHOOD. SURE A LOT OF LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THIS CONVERSATION AROUND CALIFORNIA'S MANDATED CHILD ABUSE REPORTING SYSTEM. AS IT EXISTS TODAY SO THAT WE CAN FURTHER PROTECT OUR CHILDREN FROM ABUSE NEGLECT. PUTS OUT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU.

THANK YOU TO THIS. NO ONE ELSE IN QUEUE AT THIS TIME TO GIVE IT ANOTHER FEW SECONDS TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE QUEUING UP IN OPPOSITION OF AB FIVE OH SIX. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE IN Q. THANK YOU NOW WILL BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THERE IS THERE ANY. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO EIGHTY FIVE OH SIX. WELL LET ME GO ON RECORD AND SAY FIRST THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WARMING TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS AND AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL. AS INDIVIDU SPENT SIXTEEN YEARS OF MY LIFE PRIOR TO COMING HERE AS A FOOTBALL COACH AND A BASEBALL COACH ON ANY GIVEN DAY I MIGHT BE RUNNING LATE AND I WOULD HAVE A PARENT WHO JUMPED IN AND- GOT MY PRACTICE STARTED FOR ME OR OR I WAS RUNNING A DRILL. AND I NEEDED ADDITIONAL HAND. APPEARANCE BOARDS JUST SOMEONE IN A PARK MIGHT JUST JUMP OUT AND ASSIST ME WITH THIS AND I WAS TRULY CONCERNED THAT IT WOULD DISSUADE AND DISCOURAGE. INDIVIDUALS WHO JUST MIGHT. BE THE- SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY MIGHT HELP THEIR SON OR DAUGHTER ON ANY GIVEN DAY SO I APPRECIATE THE MOMENTS THAT YOU'RE- TAKING- REWARDING THEM FROM HAVING TO BE A- MANDATORY REPORTER. I'M JUST CURIOUS AS IT RELATES TO THE TRAINING AGAIN- OTHER QUOTES ON ANY GIVEN DAY YOU MIGHT HAVE SOMEONE VOLUNTEERS SO HOW DO YOU JUDGE IF THEY VOLUNTEER FIRST. NUMBER OF HOURS IF YOU KNOW WHICH ONE DAY THEY MIGHT. pWOULD THEY STILL HAVE TO TAKE THE TRAINING IF THEY DON'T KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE VOLUNTEERING FOR. WHAT IS IT THIRTY TWO HOURS YOU SAID OR SIXTEEN HOURS. TOTAL FIXED. THE REQUIREMENT IS FOR REGULAR VOLUNTEER SO THE SITUATION THAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING EVEN BEFORE THE AMENDMENTS WOULD HAVE NEVER KICKED IN- THAT REQUIREMENT IT WOULD REQUIRE SIXTEEN HOURS IN A MONTH OR THIRTY TWO HOURS IN A YEAR. THOSE AREN'T ARM STEP IN VOLUNTEERS. I WOULD SUGGEST THOUGH HOWEVER THAT WE SHOULD REALLY THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT AS A PARENT WHEN I'M SENDING MY CHILDREN TO AN ACTIVITY. I'M HOPEFUL THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING MY CHILDREN ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN VETTED IN FACT I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND OUT HOW MANY SITUATIONS THAT WE LEAVE OUR CHILDREN. WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVEN'T BEEN VETTED IN SO YOU KNOW I. I UNDERSTAND THE KIND OF AYE I'M RUNNING HALF AN HOUR LATE AND ANOTHER PARENT STEPS IN- BUT QUITE FRANKLY I THINK IF WE WANT TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT STOPPING. CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS TOWARDS OUR CHILDREN AND LEAVING THEM IN THE CARE OF PEOPLE WE KNOW AND TRUST THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE- STRINGENT ON WHO'S DOING THE SPONSORING. THAT THAT'S JUST. A PARENTS RIO AND THAT'S HOW I APPROACH THIS- AGAIN I WAS SHOCKED TO FIND A LOT OF THINGS OUT IN THIS BILL THAT OUR SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHERS ARE YOU KNOW- THE FOLKS WHO ARE TAKING YOUR KIDS ON FIELD TRIPS UP FROM SCHOOL NONE OF THEM ARE VETTED- SO IF. IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO VOLUNTEER ON A REGULAR BASIS AND USUALLY IF YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOMEBODY WHO IS DOING SO BECAUSE THEY ARE ACTING AS A PREDATOR IN SOME WAY- IT'S USUALLY NOT THE PERSON WHO STEPS AND SO I THINK THE SIXTEEN HOUR KIND OF. TAKES CARE OF THAT SIXTEEN HOURS A WEEK IS A LOT OF VOLUNTEER- IN A MONTH AND THIRTY TWO AND HERE'S A LOT OF VOLUNTEER HOURS. I AGREE M. MY USER I. TOTALLY GET THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT YOU'VE SET UP YOUR ON THIS BILL. AND I THINK WE'VE ALL HAVE ENOUGH EXAMPLES OF THOSE ORGANIZATIONS NON MAINLY. MUCH LARGER THAT WE'VE ENTRUSTED AND HAVE HAD A REPUTATION THAT HAS. YOU KNOW FAR EXCEEDED. OUR EXPECTATIONS OF NARAL LEARNING- THE LOVE THE. DEGREE OF- CHILD ABUSE OF SIKKIM PLACE AND SOME OF THE- WHAT WE CONSIDER. ORGANIZATIONS I'M- AGREE WHERE YOU GO AND I. UNDERSTANDING YOU'RE- A MEMBER AND YOUR- OPPOSED TO MEN ARE. I THINK OKAY AND MOVING THIS BILL SO I GUESS WE'RE SEEKING A WELL WOULD YOU- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSER. I'M AND I APPRECIATE IT CHAIRMAN- I APPRECIATE. HABEEN THIS OPPORTUNITY I DEAL WITH THE OPPOSITION I DO WANT TO SUGGEST THOUGH IT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO SAY ARE MANDATORY REPORTERS SYSTEM IS BROKEN THE TRUTH IS I DON'T CARE IF IT'S THAT THEY'RE BEING ABUSED AND NEGLECTED. THAT IS AN IMPORTANT REACH AND SO IF THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES YES BY ALL MEANS LET'S HIRE FIRST OF ALL I THINK A LOT OF IT IS WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH- WORKERS WHO ARE ACTUALLY INVESTIGATING THESE CLAIMS AND ALSO THE PERCENTAGES THAT THEY USE AS THE REASONING FOR WHY THIS ISN'T WORKING ISN'T ACCURATE WE ALL KNOW WE'VE ALL SEEN THE NETFLIX SERIES RIGHT. UNFORTUNATELY SOMEBODY SENT OUT TO THREE FOUR TIMES BEFORE THE INVESTIGATION FIND SOMETHING AND A LOT OF TIMES THEY DON'T FIND OUT UNTIL THE CHILD HAS DIED SO. I THINK WE NEED TO BE VERY- AWARE THAT THAT YES MAYBE WE'RE HAVING SOME DISPARITIES IN THE WAY FAMILIES ARE TREATED THAT IS A PROBLEM IT YOU KNOW INHERENT BIAS IS A PROBLEM. BUT THE REAL PROBLEM IS CHILDREN WHO ARE ABUSED NEGLECTED AND SUFFER FROM I'M CHILDHOOD SEXUAL ABUSE THAT WE'RE NOT CATCHING AND WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE THE SYSTEM BETTER BY JUST SAYING WELL WE DON'T WANNA DO MANDATORY REPORTERS ANYMORE SO I JUST IT'S A JUST A FAIR WARNING MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS NEXT YEAR ON THAT PIECE OF IT. I JUST THINK IT'S VERY DANGEROUS FOR US TO- DECIDED THAT IT'S NOT PORTENT UP TO PROTECT. CHILDREN WITH THE SYSTEM WE HAVE TODAY.

WOMEN TRANS AND NON BINARY FOLKS AND BECAUSE EXCESSIVE FORCE AND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT IN THE FIRST AND SECOND MOST REPORTED COMPLAINTS. AGAINST POLICE OFFICERS WE ARE IN ATHENS.

WE'RE ASKING FOR YOUR. SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. PROFESSORS WITH YET YES HELLO LOOK AT THANK YOU MANY BUT- BEGIN. HELLO WAITING FOR YOUR TEST THIS. YEAH THANK YOU MY NAME IS JOANNA SCHWARTZ I AM A LAW PROFESSOR AT UCLA SCHOOL OF LAW AND MY RESEARCH HAS EXAMINED HOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BUDGET FOR AND PAID SETTLEMENTS AND JUDGMENTS AND POLICE MISCONDUCT. AS WELL AS THE LESSONS THAT STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CAN LEARN FROM THE- I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF EIGHTY SIX OF THREE WHICH REQUIRES. CITIES COUNTIES IN THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL PROPOSED FINANCIAL DETAILS ABOUT POLICE MISCONDUCT SETTLEMENTS AND JUDGMENTS ON THEIR WEBSITE. IT'S OFTEN SAID THAT YOU CANNOT MANAGE WHAT YOU DO NOT MEASURE. REQUIRING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO REPORT ON PAY OUT IN THESE CASES MAY HELP THEM BEGIN TO LEARN FROM THEM. BOTH ONE PERSON AGENCIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY PAY LITTLE ATTENTION TO INFORMATION IN THE LAWSUIT BROUGHT AGAINST THEM AND THEIR OFFICERS. CASES ARE DEFENDED BY CITY ATTORNEYS. THE MONEY TO RESOLVE THE CASES ARE PAID FROM GENERAL FUND. AND LITTLE EFFORT IS MADE TO KEEP TRACK OF WHICH OFFICERS HAVE BEEN NAMED AS DEFENDANTS THE NATURE OF THE ALLEGATIONS AGAINST. THEM OR THE CASE'S OUTCOME. WHAT STUDIED POLICE LAW PAY IN A ONE. ACROSS COUNTRY I FOUND EIGHTEEN OF THE LARGEST CITIES AND COUNTIES HAD STUDIED. NO RECORD IN ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY OUR OFFICE REFLECTING HOW MUCH THEY SPENT IN THE LAWSUIT INVOLVING POLICE IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES CAN LEARN A LOT LOTS OF DATA IF THEY PAID ATTENTION TO IT. IN MADISON FOR EXAMPLE CLOSE LAWSUIT FILED ARE USED TO IDENTIFY RISKY BEHAVIOR AND THOSE FINDINGS. I ARE USED TO REDUCE DANGERS IN MEDICAL PRACTICE. IT ALSO WELL ESTABLISHED THAT REQUIRING ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENT TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR BEHAVIOR IS A KEY TOOL OF REGULATION. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS REQUIRE DISCLOSURE INFORMATION TO CONSUMERS LAWS REQUIRE CORPORATIONS TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION ABOUT THE USE OF CHEMICAL WORKPLACE. INJURY AND NUTRITIONAL VALUE. IT IS REQUIRED. ABOUT APPROVE BEHAVIOR BOTH THE ORGANIZATION OF LEARN MORE ABOUT THEIR CONDUCT AND BECAUSE THE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THIS INFORMATION CREATE PRESSURES TO IMPROVE.

MORNING MISTER CHAIR SENATORS ARE AB TWO NINE SIX TO KEEP CALIFORNIA FAMILIES WHOLE BY PREVENTING DEPORTATIONS BASED ON FAULTY GROUNDS. ALL OF US HAVE HEARD THE TRAGEDIES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO AFTER SERVING YEARS IN PRISON AND PAY THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY ARE SUDDENLY TRANSFERRED TO ICE UPON THEIR RELEASE. WE DON'T HEAR IS THAT MANY OF THESE PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW THAT THE CRIMES THEY WERE CONVICTED OF REPORTABLE CRIMES. CURRENT LAW ALREADY SAYS THAT IF SOMEONE IS ON AWARE OF THE ADVERSE IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES OF A CHARGE THEN THAT CONVICTION COULD BE FOUND TO BE LEGALLY INVALID. A FEW YEARS AGO IN TWENTY SIXTEEN OR LEGISLATURE CREATED A PROCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS ON AWARE OF THESE IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR CONVICTION TO PETITION THE COURT. BUT THAT PROCESS IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO THOSE CONVICTED AFTER A PLEA BARGAIN IT'S NOT AVAILABLE TO THOSE CONVICTED AFTER TRIAL. I'M OF THE PERSPECTIVE WE SHOULDN'T-PUNISH PEOPLE FOR PURSUING TRIALS AND TRYING TO PROVE THEIR INNOCENCE PEOPLE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A TRIAL. THE CONSEQUENCES OF INVALID CONVICTIONS CAN BE DEVASTATING FOR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS TORN FROM THEIR FAMILIES WHO HAVE THEIR PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP BLOCKED BASED ON CONVICTIONS. THAT ARE LEGALLY INVALID. THIS BILL WOULD SIMPLY EXPAND THE CURRENT PROCESS TO INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS CONVICTED BY JURY TRIAL SO THAT THEY CAN PRESENT EVIDENCE TO A COURT THAT THEY MEANINGFULLY- THAT THEY FAIL TO MEANINGFULLY UNDERSTAND IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES. AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE AND TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESS. THANK YOU. MARIE WILL GO TO THE PRIMARY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT- WILL PROVIDE A PERFORMANCE OF TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT OF. AB TWELVE FIVE NINE BY THEIR PRIMARY WITNESSES. HELLO HELLO. YES GO AHEAD PLEASE.

AT THE END QUITE LATER LIKE SAVING THOUSANDS OF THAT AMOUNT AND WHO WOULD HAVE EITHER SEPARATELY BALBOA IMPACT. ON CONNECTION. NOW IT'S KIND OF THE FINE PAUL LACK FOURTEEN SEVEN THREE POINT SEVEN AND EXPAND THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHALLENGE OLD ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS TO ALL PEOPLE INCLUDING THOSE CONDUCTED BY TRIAL. ONLY 2% OF PEOPLE ARE CONVICTED BY TRIAL IN CALIFORNIA AND EVEN SMALLER PERCENTAGE ELIGIBLE CURRENTLY FUNDED THIS STATUE. I AM CONFIDENT YOU LIKE. LEAVE THAT NO KALENJIN PEOPLE NO MATTER HOW SMALL SHOULD SEPARATE THE OLD ILLEGAL CONNECTION. IT INDIVIDUALS LEFT OUT REPRESENT VERY REAL PEOPLE INCLUDING BACKGROUND BY FATHER OF THREE WHO HAS LIVED IN THE UNITED STATES HAS A GREEN CARD HOLDER SINCE HE WAS THIRTEEN. ECONOMIC CURRENTLY IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS THE FINANCING MARIJUANA CONVICTION SIX YEARS ABOUT THAT CAN BEEN REDUCED TO A MISDEMEANOR. BUT FOR THE CAT THAT HE CONVICTED BY JURY TRIAL THE CRIME WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO PRESENT EVIDENCE. THAT HIS CONVICTION WHAT. STOP COULD BE. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT POINT FOURTEEN SEVENTY THREE POINT SEVEN HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT CHANCE. AND IT TAKES A MANDATORY PERMANENT AND LYFT KIND SEPARATION PUBLIC FORMALLY. GOOD CLEAN UP EXAMPLE. THERE IS NO IN THE STATE. WHICH IS WHY IT HAS TO DATE GENDER NO OPPOSITION AND HAS DRAWN SUPPORT CAN BE A OFFICES INCLUDING YELLOW SANTA CLARA SAN FRANCISCO. LOS ANGELES AND THE ENTIRE PROSECUTORS ARE LYING. IN ADDITION TO MORE THAN THIRTY GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS FROM THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. PLEASE HOLD WHILE. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO SOME OF THE BILL TWELVE EIGHTY ONE TODAY AB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE SEEKS TO AMEND THE PENAL CODE SECTION RELATING TO EXPUNGEMENT TO SPECIFY THAT THE DISMISSAL OF A CASE UDER THOSE SECTIONS WOULD NOT AUTOMATICALLY RELIEVE A DEFENDANT FROM THE TERM EVENT UGH UNEXPIRED TENURE CRIMINAL PROTECTIVE ORDER ISSUED IN THIS CASE IN THE CASE. ARE THESE TEN YOUR PROTECTIVE ORDERS ARE ONLY ISSUED IN CERTAIN SERIOUS CASES SUCH AS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE STALKING AND ELDER ABUSE THE ORDERS PLAY SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN PROTECTING SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE VICTIMS OF A VIOLENT CRIME CRIMINAL PROTECTIVE ORDERS ARE NOT PUNITIVE IN NATURE THEY ARE NON PENAL RESTRICTIONS DESIGNED TO PROTECT. CRIME VICTIMS. THE BILL IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY DOES NOT REQUIRED THAT PROTECTIVE ORDERS REMAIN IN PLACE IN ALL CASES EMERITI PART. PRESERVES JUDICIAL DISCRETION TO TERMINATE OR MODIFY AN ORDER DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCE. THE BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND ENJOYS SUPPORT FROM CRIME VICTIM ADVOCACY GROUPS. TODAY WITH ME ON THE PHONE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT IS LESLIE KLEIN ON BEHALF OF THE L. A. COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THANK YOU. THANK YOU PRIMARY WITNESS PREPARE TO TEST SOME OF OUR REGION TESTIFY AT THIS POINT. YES THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M LESLIE KLEIN I'M AN ASSISTANT HEAD DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE MOST RECENTLY WITH THE FAMILY VIOLENCE DIVISION WE ARE THE PROUD SPONSOR AB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE. THE PROTECTIVE ORDERS ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TOOLS USED IN THE PROTECTION OF VICTIMS OF CRIME PARTICULARLY IN CASES INVOLVING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND STALKING INTO THE INTRINSIC ONGOING NATURE OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THE INCIDENT AMOUNTS TO A MISDEMEANOR OR A FELONY. ANY ACT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CAN QUICKLY ESCALATE INTO A VIOLENT FELONY INCLUDING ACT OF GUN VIOLENCE. I HAVE CERTAINLY SEEN IT HAPPEN IN MY TWENTY SIX YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. THE PROTECTIVE ORDERS GIVE VICTIMS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO KEEP THEIR ABUSERS AWAY A PROTECTIVE ORDER CAN LITERALLY BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH. THE BILL WE ARE PROPOSING DOES NOT ADD ANY MORE RESTRICTIONS IT SIMPLY CLARIFIES A BASEMENT IN THE LAW AS IT CURRENTLY. IS WRITTEN. FOR TEN ALREADY HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND DISCRETION TO ISSUE CRIMINAL PROTECTIVE ORDERS UPON CONVICTION AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE STALKING ELDER ABUSE AND BESTBUY TAX CRIMES THAT ARE VALID FOR UP TO TEN YEARS. IMPORTANTLY COURTS HAVE THE JURISDICTION TO MODIFY OR TERMINATE THOSE PROTECTIVE ORDERS WITHIN THE TEN YEARS THAT THEIR INSURANCE AND NOTHING IN THIS BILL CHANGES THAT. THE BILL WE ARE PROPOSING WHAT AMENDED PENAL CODE SECTION TWELVE OF THREE POINT FOR PUBLIC THREE POINT FOR A PUBLIC THREE POINT FOUR B. AND TWELVE A THREE POINT FOUR TWO FIVE WHICH ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS EXPUNGEMENT FACTIONS. CURRENTLY WHEN A DEFENDANT MOVED TO OR HAD THE CASE DISMISSED. UNDER ONE OF THE SECTIONS NOTHING IN EXISTING LAW ADDRESS IT HOW THE COURTS SHOULD HANDLE THE ISSUE AND THE ISSUE OF THE UNEXPIRED PROTECTIVE ORDER. THIS BILL CLARIFIED THAT WHEN THEY DISMANTLE IS GRANTED UNDER ANY OF THE SECTION A PROTECTIVE ORDER PRESUMPTIVELY REMAINS VALID UNTIL ITS EXPIRATION EXPIRATION DATE FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE VICTIM. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME GIVING THE COURTS THE DISCRETION TO MODIFY OR TERMINATE THE ORDER. IT'S PRESENTED WITH INFORMATION THAT WOULD JUSTIFY SUCH ACTION. CURRENTLY WHEN THIS ISSUE ARISES IT IS UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL JUDGE ON HOW HE OR SHE DECIDES TO HANDLE THE ISSUE. IT IT IT EVEN ADDRESSED AT ALL MANY JUDGES WILL APPROVE THE PROTECTIVE ORDER REMAINING IN EFFECT. MANY TIMES BUT IT SHOULD NOT DISCUSSED AT ALL BUT THE PROTECTIVE ORDER REMAINS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT CHECK THEM LEAVING A DEFENDANT WITHOUT ANY INSIGHT THAT HE OR SHE MAY STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE PROTECTIVE ORDER. IN OTHER INSTANCES COURT MAY FEEL THEY MUST DISMISS THE EXISTING PROTECT THE BORDER IF THEY DISMISSED THE CASE. AB EIGHTY ONE IF THE COURT GUIDANCE ON AT THE STORY AND PUT THE DEFENDANT ON NOTICE. HE OR SHE STILL SUBJECT TO THE ORDER UNLESS AND UNTIL THE COURT TERMINATE OR MODIFY THE ORDER. IT FURTHER AGAINST THE VICTIM THE PEACE OF MIND TO KNOW THE PROTECTIVE ORDER IN PLACE. ANY SUGGESTION THAT A VICTIM COULD SIMPLY GET A CIVIL RESTRAINING ORDER IF THEY REALLY WANTED ONE IT'S FLAWED. NAVIGATING THE COURT SYSTEM IS DAUNTING TO MOST LAYPEOPLE IT FORCES THE VICTIM TO HAVE TO RELIVE THE ATROCITIES THEY'VE ALREADY EXPERIENCED WHILE HOPING AND PRAYING THE JUDGE WILL GRANT IT. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY AS EXPRESSED TO ME BY A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR THERE IS A FEAR THAT GOING BACK TO COURT YEARS LATER WELL AS SHE PUT IT. OKAY THE PHARMACY NASTY AND REFOCUSED. THE ABUSER ON THE VICTIM. AB EIGHTY HELPS ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT BEHIND TENURE PROTECTIVE ORDER LOGIC ISN'T PUT IN JEOPARDY BY ADDRESSING THE VAGUENESS CURRENTLY FOUND IN THE EXPUNGEMENT SECTIONS OF THE PENAL CODE. SECTION I HAVE NEVER ELIMINATED ALREADY ASHU TO THE EXIT FOR THE LIMIT. REPRESENTS TWENTY CENTS POSSIBLY RIGHT THE TERM TIME. YES I AM I AM VERY CLOSE TO THEM IN A- BIG DESPERATE LIMITED PURPOSE BUDGET FOLLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL WHOSE CASE HAS BEEN DISMISSED THE RIGHT TO SAY THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CONVICTED OF A CRIME WHEN SUBMITTING A JOB APPLICATION. BUT THOSE CATS PROTECTION'S ENCASED BOX HAVE ALSO MADE CLEAR THAT NOT EVERY CONSEQUENT ADDED CONVICTION SHOULD GET THE KERR. THE INDIVIDUAL WHO KILL BARRED FROM OWNING OR POSSESSING A FIREARM BUT STILL REGISTER INSPECTED CENTER AND A MASSIVE DEAL DISBURSING CONVICTION THAT THE BIKE IT'S. RATIONS THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE COURTS HAVE RECOGNIZED NOT EVERY SPRINTER AND LIMITATIONS PENALTY. PROTECTIVE ORDER ARE NOT AS A KIND OF. FOR THE DEFENDANT BUT AFTER. FOR THE VICTIMS WE ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW WILL MOVE TO. THE HEARING ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE YEARS OR ANY WITNESSES AND- SUPPORT WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF FOR- AB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE SHE NO ONE HERE WILL NOW GO TO THE OVERFLOW ROOM OF TWENTY FORTY THERE'S NO ONE THERE AS WELL.

THANK YOU NOW WILL MOVE TO OPPOSITION WE SEE WE HAVE A SHOW YOU LISTED AS A PRIMARY LEAD IN OPPOSITION. AS THE INDIVIDUAL REPRESENTING NATIO YOU PREPARE TO TESTIFY AT THIS TIME. YES GOOD MORNING M CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS KATHY SURE FOR ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION- WE RESPECTFULLY NOT OPPOSE AB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE. CALIFORNIA RECOGNIZE THE BENEFITS OF ALLOWING CERTAIN OFFENDERS TO PUT THEIR RECORD BEHIND THEM AND MOVE ON WITH THEIR LIVES BY ALLOWING THOSE OFFENDERS TO HAVE THEIR CONVICTIONS EXPUNGED AB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE WOULD INSTEAD IN THE LIMITED CATEGORIES OF CASES WHERE THE PUNISHMENT IS AVAILABLE KEEP INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SUBJECT TO PROTECTIVE ORDERS UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE CRIMINAL COURT FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO TEN YEARS SH TO ALLOW THE ORDER TO REMAIN IN EFFECT. THE KIND OF CASES IN WHICH SUCH AN ORDER CAN BE ISSUED INCLUDE NOT ONLY FELONIES OR CRIMES OF VIOLENCE THAT ALSO INCLUDE MANY MISDEMEANORS FOR EXAMPLE ALL REGISTRABLE FACT. AND ATTEMPTING- OVER A PROTECTIVE ORDER CAN BE ISSUED NOT ONLY TO PROTECT THE VICTIM BUT ALSO IN SOME CASES PROTECT THE WITNESS. TO A CRIME COMPLIANCE WITH AN ORDER THAT REQUIRES STAYING AWAY FROM AN INDIVIDUAL'S NEIGHBORS FRIENDS OR FAMILY MEMBERS MAY POSE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO THAT PERSON'S ABILITY TO BE INTEGRATED TO THE- COMMUNITY. A CALIFORNIA LAW RECOGNIZES SOME INDIVIDUAL DESERVE A SECOND CHANCE. TO START OVER FREE OF THE CONTROL OF THE CRIMINAL COURT. AB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE WE DID NINE MANY INDIVIDUAL PLATFORM. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NOBLE. THANK YOU NOW WILL MOVE BACK TO THE HEARING ROOM AS ARE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION HERE IN FORTY TWO OH THREE. SHE NINE WILL GO CHORE OVER FORMER TWENTY FORTY THERE'S NO ONE THERE AS WELL. MODERATOR WILL NOW GO BACK TO THE PHONE LINES IN ITS INVESTORS. WITNESSES ARE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. UGH AB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE NOW IS THE TIME. SPEAKING OPPOSITION OF AB TWELVE EIGHTY ONE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR TOUCH TONE PHONE AT THIS TIME. MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE THE ONE CHEWING UP IN OPPOSITION TO STOP. WE'LL GET A FEW MORE SECONDS JUST TO MAKE SURE. ALL RIGHT WILL BRING BACK TO YOU MANY TIMES ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBER CENTER SERVER COM LONGER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I. JUST HAD A QUESTION- SO IN NGUYEN V. EXPUNGEMENT HAS HAPPENED IN THE CASE IS DISMISSED. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT PROTECTIVE ORDERS THAT ALIGN WITH THAT PARTICULAR CASE ARE WE JUST TALKING ABOUT PROTECTIVE ORDERS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN- ISSUED. INDEPENDENT CORRECT OF THE OF THAT PARTICULAR CASE THE INTENT IS FOR- IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE BUT I DO HAVE OF LESLIE THAT CAN ANSWER OTHER QUESTIONS ITEM MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT IN THAT PARTICULAR CASE NOT TO- REMOVE THE EXPUNGEMENT OR EVEN NOT ADDRESS THE EXPAND OUR I'M SORRY THE PROTECTIVE ORDER DURING THE EXPUNGEMENT. AND CURRENTLY IT'S NOT ADDRESSED AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIX IT IS NOT EVEN A PART OF. THE CONVERSATION IF YOU WILL WHEN THE EXCITEMENT HAPPENS SO WE'RE TRYING TO BRING IT INTO THE INTO THE FOREFRONT SO THAT THE JUDGE HAS THE DISCRETION TO SAY. WE CAN EXPECT WE CAN TERMINATE THE PROTECTIVE ORDER OR- IF IT'S BEING CAPPED AT LEAST THE VICTIM KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THAT PROTECTIVE ORDER RIGHT NOW IT'S BASICALLY- IF THE EXPUNGEMENT HAPPENS SOME SOME FOLKS WILL SAY WELL THE PROTECTIVE ORDER- GOALS WITH THAT AND OTHERS. JUDGES SAY IT DOES NOT SO THERE'S NO CLEAR. DEFINITION OF WHEN IT DOES. GET REMOVED OR WHEN IT DOESN'T. OKAY SO BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING WITH THE BILL WAS THAT. EVEN IF THE ONCE THE- EXPUNGEMENT HAS HAPPENED THAT. THE UNEXPIRED PROTECTIVE ORDER STILL CONTINUES UNLESS THE COURT DECIDES TO MODIFY IT WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM. ONCE THE EXPUNGEMENT HAPPENS THE UNEXPIRED PROTECTIVE ORDER IS STILL BROUGHT TO THE COURT FOR THEM TO MAKE A DECISION SO. IT'S I MEAN IT'S A DISTINCTION WITH A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND YOU'RE GIVING AUTHORITY TO THE JUDGE TO SAY TAKE ALL OF THIS INTO CONSIDERATION. AND THEN ON THE OTHER HAND YEAR YOU'RE SAYING WILL EVERYTHING IS GOING TO CONTINUE ON LAST YOU SPECIFICALLY TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION SO IS IT GOING THE FORMER FOR THE LATTER WELL. IF I CAN ASK CLOSELY TO OUR I'M SORRY. WHY OF. THIS LEAD TO RESPOND TO THAT PLEASE BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW AGAIN MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT GIVES THE JUDGE THE DISCRETION TO DO EITHER RIGHT TO SAY YES OR NO AND SOME JUDGES ARE CHOOSING ONE AND OTHERS ARE CHOOSING THE OTHER AND THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE- FOR THE BILL. BLACKLICK YES SOAK SO CURRENTLY IT THE WAY IT WORKS IS WHEN SOMEBODY MAKES THEM AN EXPUNGEMENT EMOTIONS THAT THE RECORD EXPUNGED. IT'S LITERALLY UP TO THE JUDGE AND TO WHOEVER'S MAKING THE MOTION ON WHETHER THEY WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE PROTECTIVE ORDER IF THERE'S ONE AND QUITE. A LOT WE ARE PROPOSING IT WOULD MAKE IT SO THAT. AT THE TIME THAT THE MOTION TO EXPUNGE IT MADE. THE PERSON MAKING IT CAN. BRING UP THE ISSUE OF THE PROTECTIVE ORDER. AND ASK THE COURT TO MODIFY OR TERMINATE. BUT IF IT DOES NOT ADDRESS- BROUGHT UP BY THE PERSON WHO IS MAKING THE MOTION ON BEHALF OF THE DEFENDANT. AND THE PRESUMPTION WOULD BE THAT THE PROTECTIVE ORDER WOULD REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT. I'M NOT AND UNTIL SOMEBODY BRINGS THAT. PROTECTIVE ORDER TO THE COURT AND THE COURT HEARS WHATEVER EVIDENCE STATE HAS BROUGHT FORWARD TO MAKE THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER IT IS APPROPRIATE OR NOT APPROPRIATE TO TERMINATE. EFFECTIVE ORDER. ITS WAY THE DEFENDANT IS ON NOTICE- WHEN YOU MAKE THE MOTION TO EXPUNGE THAT THE PROTECTIVE ORDER WILL REMAIN IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT. THE SAME WAY HE CAN'T OWN A GUN IS ON NOTICE. REMAINS IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT. AND THAT DAY. TO ABIDE BY THAT PROTECT ORDER AND AT THE VICTIM WILL THEN STILL BE PROTECTED. AGAIN I'M LOCKED INTEL. EVIDENTLY BROUGHT FORWARD THAT JUSTIFIED THE ELIMINATION OF THE PROTECTIVE ORDER. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT CONFUSED ME BECAUSE- IT IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU WERE SAYING IN THE BEGINNING THE IT WAS A LONG SENTENCE BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE THE FIRST PART OF THE SENTENCE SAID THAT AT THE TIME THAT THE EXPUNGEMENT IS HAPPENING THAT DEFENDANT'S COUNSEL. CAN THEN ALSO BRING UP THE ISSUE OF THE UNEXPIRED PROTECTIVE ORDER TO ASK THAT IT BE MODIFIED BUT THEN IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE SECOND PART OF WHAT YOU SAID SAID THAT AT THE TIME OF THE EXPUNGEMENT THE UNEXPIRED PROTECTIVE ORDER WOULD STILL BE% IN A FACT UNLESS AND UNTIL SOMEONE BROUGHT ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THAT UNEXPIRED PROTECTIVE ORDER COULD THEN. BE EXPIRED SO. ARE THOSE AT THE SO ABILITY. LET THAT MAYBE I CAN TRY TO EXPLAIN IT WHEN THAT MOTION IS MADE UNDER THE AS WE ARE PROPOSING IT. IF NOBODY DISCUSSES IT NOBODY BRINGS UP THE ISSUE OF THE PROTECTIVE ORDER AT THE TIME THE EXPUNGEMENT MADE. THIS LOT WOULD KEEP THE PROTECTIVE ORDER PRESUMPTIVELY IN PLACE. THAT DOESN'T PRECLUDE SOMEBODY FROM BRINGING UP THE PROTECTIVE ORDER AND ASKING THAT IT BE MODIFIED OR TERMINATED AT THE SAME TIME AS- THE EXPUNGEMENT. BUT AS WE ARE PROPOSING IT. IT WOULD KEEP THE PROTECTIVE ORDER IN PLACE. AT THE TIME THAT THE CONFINEMENT PRESUMPTIVELY AND LAST SOMEBODY AFFIRMATIVELY ASK THE COURT OR THE COURT ON ITS OWN MOTION DECIDES THAT IT WANTS YOUR BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE TERMINATED BUT THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION. YES IT DOES IT BUT IT BRINGS ME BACK TO I GUESS MY ORIGINAL QUESTION WHICH WAS WHETHER OR NOT THE PROTECTIVE ORDER ALIGNED WITH THE PARTICULAR CASE AND SO IF A CASE HAS BEEN EXPUNGED IN THE PRESUMPTION OR ASSUMPTION S THAT- IF YOU FIND. THERE'S NO MORE DERELICTION WITH THE PARTICULAR DEFENDANT BECAUSE OF THAT PARTICULAR CASE AND WHY WOULD YOU HAVE A PROTECTIVE ORDER IN PLACE- FOR A CASE THAT HAS BEEN- DISMISSED OR EXPUNGED. BUT I THAT'S NOT YOU KNOW ABOUT. YOU DON'T ADDRESS THAT OR WOULD YOU LIKE DOWNTURN YEAH. D. D. EXPUNGEMENT. ABOUT LAWS. OUR THE WAY THEY WORK IS THAT IF SOMEBODY HAS HAS- MET THE STANDARDS FOR COMPLETING THEIR PROBATION. EIGHT THE CASE AUTOMATICALLY IS ENTITLED TO BE EXPUNGED IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE VICTIM BEING PROTECTED SO WHILE THERE THEY MAY HAVE MET ALL THE GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS THAT THEY NEEDED TO FOR PROBATION IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY ADDRESS THE PROTECTION OF THE VICTIM NOT EVERYTHING OKAY GET A TENURE PROTECTIVE ORDER. SO IT REALLY THE TENURE PROTECTIVE ORDERS GO WITH THE MOST SERIOUS MOLD MOST VIOLENT CASES THAT ADDS A LOT THAT CHANGE WHEN T COMES TO- PROTECTIVE JIMMY TO EXPUNGEMENT. IT MADE IT EASIER TO GET A CASE EXPUNGED BUT WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSED THE ISSUE- THE PROTECTIVE ORDERS AND WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN TO THEM AT THE TIME OF THE EXPUNGEMENT. SO THERE'S INCONSISTENCIES IN THE WAY THE LAWS HAVE DEVELOPED BUT A LOT THAT HAS REALLY ADDRESSED THE FACT THAT DICKENS WE ARE VERY CONCERNED FOR THE SAFETY OF THE VICTIMS. AND THE PROTECTIVE ORDERS THEY DON'T. ENTER THE DEFENDANT ACCEPTED THAT THEY PREVENT THEM FROM BEING IN CONTACT WITH THE VICTIMS WHO ARE AFRAID TO INTERFERE AT. THE AT THE DEFENDANT'S. SENATE SKINNER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I THINK BY I APPRECIATE- SENATOR TOM WORKERS QUESTIONS BECAUSE WHEN OUR TO STAND THAT IT'S- THE PRESUMPTION IS THAT THE PROTECTIVE ORDER WILL CONTINUE UNDER THIS LAW UNLESS AT THE SAME TIME DEEP. CHORDS PROCESSING THE EXPUNGEMENT THAT THE ENTITY ASKING FOR THE EXPUNGEMENT ALSO ASKS FOR A LIFTING OF THE PROTECTIVE ORDER AT WHICH TIME THE WHOLE DISCUSSION CAN TAKE PLACE AS TO WHETHER THAT PROTECTIVE ORDER STILL NEEDED BUT IF THE INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT. ASK FOR THE PROTECTIVE ORDER TO BE LIFTED IT WOULD CONTINUE SO MY QUESTION AND ASSUMING THAT I'VE ACCURATELY WHO WERE IN THE IN MY OWN- LAYPERSON WAY. I'D DESCRIBE THIS MAN MY QUESTION WOULD BE IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE LAW AS PROPOSED THAT WOULD. GIVE SO I FIND THE LAWYER ASKING FOR THE PROCESSING THE EXPUNGEMENT I ALSO ASK FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE PROTECTIVE ORDER IS THERE ANYTHING IN THE WAY THIS LAWS WRITTEN THAT WOULD. FURTHER HINDER THE ABILITY FOR THE- PROTECTIVE ORDER TO BE LEFT SOON OTHER WORDS IS IT WOULD STILL ALLOW THE SAME KIND OF PROCESS THAT WOULD HAPPEN. IN ANY ARE. COURT DISCUSSION AROUND LIFTING SUCH AN ORDER OR IS THERE SOMETHING IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD FURTHER RESTRICT. YOU KNOW THERE'S NOTHING FURTHER THAT WOULD RESTRICT IT SO IF YOU HAD A SITUATION WHERE THE ATTORNEY WENT AND MADE THE MOTION TO EXPAND AND AT THE SAME TIME ASK THE COURT TO MODIFY OR TERMINATE PROTECTIVE ORDER. THEN THE JUDGE WOULD HEAR THE INFORMATION AND MAKE AN ASSESSMENT BASED ON THE CASE AND THE FACT AND ANY ANY EVIDENCE THEY WERE WILLING TO TAKE OR HERE ON WIDE AND PROTECT THE BORDER SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT BE TERMINATED SO NO IT DOESN'T. PUT ANY FURTHER LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY. TO MODIFY OR TERMINATE THE PROTECTIVE ORDER. ALL RIGHT I APPRECIATE. THE CLARIFICATIONS AND- AND COMFORTABLE. OUT WITH THE WITH THE BILL THANK YOUNG BOY AND IF I MAY- MISTER CHAIR PROTECTIVE ORDERS ARE USUALLY OR- TENURE PROTECTIVE ORDERS ARE ISSUED IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES ELDER ABUSE AND SEXUAL UP SIX TO SEXUAL ABUSE NOTHING ELSE SOLD YOU KNOW TYPICAL RESTRAINING ORDERS CAN GO ANYWHERE DEPENDING ON THE JUDGE FROM ONE YEAR TO FIVE YEARS IS USUALLY THE MAXIMUM IF THAT THAT OFFENDER AND I HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH THAT AT THE OFFENDER COMES BACK. AND IS TAKEN BACK TO COURT AND IF ON A REGULAR RESTRAINING ORDER THAT THE JUDGE WOULD RE ISSUE THIS TIME A FIVE YEAR MOST OF THE TIME A FIVE YEAR RESTRAINING ORDER BECAUSE THEY VIOLATED THE FIRST ONE THOSE ARE THE REGULAR RESTRAINING ORDERS PROTECTIVE ORDERS ARE USUALLY AGAIN WITH THE MESSAGE FIVE SEVERE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ELDER ABUSE AND SEXUAL ABUSE OF A TEN YEAR IS DIFFERENT THAN A REGULAR RESTRAINING. ORDER IF THAT MAKES ANY SENSE. I ANY FURTHER. QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS HERE- THANK YOU FOR THIS MEASURE BUT I TO AMONG LOW CONFUSION OR SO THEN WHEN I STARTED AS A RELIGIOUS MEASURE BECAUSE- AGAIN OUT BY WHAT'S BEING DESCRIBED SEEMS LIKE WAS ALREADY IN PLACE I THOUGHT THE JUDGE ALREADY HAD THE DISCRETION TO. AT THE TIME OF THE EXPUNGEMENT DETERMINE IF A PROTECTIVE ORDER SHOULD CONTINUE OR NOT SO. I'M REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ADDITIONAL FORTY DOES THE COURT HAVE WHERE THAT. PERSON WHO'S JUST HIT THEIR- RECORD EXPUNGED- I THINK A CENTER COMMA GRASS AND ARTS CENTER- SKINNER OUSTED IN PETER- PREVENT THE INDIVIDUAL FROM- GETTING THERE BOB LIPS IS RESTRAINING ORDER LIFTED OR PROTECT WATER REMOVED AND IS IT THIS IMPEDED ANY WHEN YOU SAID NO OR YOUR WHAT THE SAID NO SO I'M JUST. REALLY TRYING TO SEE WHAT'S DEFAULT TO ME THE WAY IT WORKS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT IT IS FOR ME PERSONALLY IT'S ABOUT THE VICTIM BUT IT'S ALSO A TO HELP- THE PERSON THAT'S BEING- YOU KNOW THAT'S IN FRONT OF THE JUDGE BECAUSE IF THERE IS NO- IF THEY DON'T MENTION IT. THE JUDGE OR ANYBODY ELSE MENTIONED THAT THEN THE PROTECTIVE ORDER IS STILL IN PLACE FOR THE TEN YEARS SO IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY THAT HAVE BEEN REHABILITATED AND HAS DONE EVERYTHING AND YOU KNOW HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT FOR IT IF YOU WILL THEN THEN THAT PROTECTIVE ORDER REMAINS IN PLACE. FOR THE TEN YEARS REGARDLESS SO THIS IN MY OPINION GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT PERSON TO ALSO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE LEARNED I'VE DONE WHAT I CAN YOU KNOW THE PROTECTIVE ORDER IS NO LONGER IN PLACE AND THAT GIVES THE JUDGE THE AUTHORITY THE WAY I UNDERSTAND IT SO IT'S- IT IS ABOUT THE VICTIMS FOR ME BUT IT'S ALSO FOR THOSE FOLKS BACK. IF IT'S NOT MENTIONED THEN THAT IF NOT ADDRESSED IN THE PROTECTIVE ORDER IS IN PLACE FOR THE TEN YEARS WITHOUT IT AND THEN LATER THEY WOULD HAVE TO COME BACK AND SAY HEY THAT REMOVE THE PROTECTIVE ORDER I'M JUST CURIOUS ON WHY WOULDN'T I INDIVIDUAL I JUST GOT MY RECORD EXPUNGED AND I KNOW I HAVE THIS FOR. RESTRAINING OR PROTECTIVE ORDER THAT STILL HANGS OVER MY IT WHY WOULDN'T I US AT THE TIME IT DEPENDS ON THE ATTORNEY SOMETIMES BUT YOU KNOW ATTORNEYS YOU KNOW YOU HAD SOME FOLKS HAVE BETTER ATTORNEYS AND OTHER IN MY OPINION AND IF I AN ATTORNEY'S JUST IN AND OUT TRYING TO JUST FINISH THIS AND DOESN'T PAY ATTENTION TO THAT AND WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT HAPPENS THEN THOSE. FOLKS DON'T. HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION- ANY. DECISION COME ON BUT THIS REQUIRE THE JUDGE TO DECLARE THAT AS SOMETHING FOR THE DEFENSE TO RAISE UP. SO THE ONUS IS ON ON THE COURT. I MEAN IF IT IF YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING THIS WOULD STILL BE IN PLACE AND THAT THE COUNCIL WOULD STILL HAVE TO. ASK FOR CONSIDERATION FOR THE PROTECTIVE ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED THIS DOESN'T DECLARE THAT IN THE EVENT OF AN EXPUNGEMENT THAT THE COURT THEN NOTIFIES THE COUNCIL THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THEY CAN DO I MEAN I THINK THAT WOULD BE MORE HELPFUL THAN SORT OF CONTINUING WITH AN ASSUMPTION. THAT COUNCIL HAS TO. MAKE THIS ASK. BUT MAYBE I'M I MEAN ARE NOT. I AGREE BECAUSE I'M I MEAN I WOULDN'T SEE WHY COUNCIL WOULDN'T IF YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A CLIENT THAT HAS. RETURNED TO WORK ON IT WHY WOULD YOU ASK THEM IN REGARDS ARE MANY CASES YOU'RE DOING. THAT'S PART OF THE PROCEDURE OF. CLEARING THIS PERSON RIGHT OR WHY WOULD YOU ASK FOR THAT THAT'S PART I'M KIND OF LOS. THANK YOU BYE. YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS A GOOD MEASURE AND BEEN WORKING ON IT HAVE BIPARTISAN SUPPORT ON THE OTHER HOUSE BY TARA YOU KNOW I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND IF YOU SEE FIT THAT THERE'S ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ACCEPT THOSE AND WORK WITH YOU ON HOW TO FIX IT TO THIS FOR IT TO BE SOMETHING THAT- YOU ARE COMFORTABLE WITH- IF IT GOES FURTHER.

WHO NOW WILL- BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO THIS MEASURE CENTER CARE. ARE EARNED A SEMI RETARDED YOU DISCUSS THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU ARE TAKING. YES ABSOLUTELY- I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHAMBER PRESENTED THREE AMENDMENTS- WE HAVE ALREADY ACCEPTED ONE. INDIA TWO IS STILL TRYING TO NARROW THE SCOPE OF IT THE SCENARIO THAT WAS DESCRIBED BY THE CHAMBERS- A LEGITIMATE ONE I THINK THE STATE IS THE EXAMPLE THAT GAVE WAS. OF SCANNING SCANNING THE DARK WEB FOR THE- FOR INFORMATION THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BENEFIT CLIENTS FOR EXAMPLE I THINK THAT DOESN'T REALLY GOT VISIT REALLY FALL UNDER THE AMBIT OF THIS PROPOSED LAW TO IT TO BEGIN WITH. BUT I'M I'M DEFINITELY WILLING TO LOOK AT THAT PARTICLAR SITUATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LANGUAGE IS THERE TO- YOU KNOW- ACCOMMODATE OUT I THINK I THINK THAT'S A LEGITIMACY EDUCATION ACT YEAH THEY'RE DOING LEGITIMATE THINGS THROUGH YOU KNOW SO. AS PART OF THEIR POWER OPERATION I THINK BUT WITH THE SAME TIME WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE EXCEPTIONS THAT HARD TO THE SO LARGE THAT WOULD KIND OF BEAT UP THE ROOTS SO TO SPEAK. SO ON THE INTENT IS TO NARROW THE AMENDMENTS SOMEONE SO THAT WE COULD TELL YA HI ACCEPTED SO I GUESS IT YEAH OF THE THREE WARY ACCEPTED ONE. SO WE STILL WORKING ON NARROWING. THE SCOPE OF THE DEAL THE TWO PIECES. BUT I DO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SAID IN A CITY. THAT THERE ACCOUNT WITH. SPECIAL SOON CHAU CANNOT BE CLEAR THAT YOU HAVE ACCEPTED THE TO THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS PUT FORTH- TO PUT A CIVIL REMEDY IN THE BILL SINCE UNLAWFUL IS UNCLEAR. AND TO CLARIFY THAT THIS IS NOT APPLIED TO THE PRESS. ARE REWORKING LANGUAGE CURRENTLY IN THE BILL. YES TOTALLY YES ACTUALLY GOT. AND USED. TAKEN ONE OF THE THREE CHAMBER AMENDMENTS ARE CORRECT CORRECT. I HAVE A QUESTION US SENATOR TROUBLED WITH REGARDS TO THE PROCEDIMIENTO HAVING ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION OR SELLING OR PURCHASING THIS INFORMATION. MY UNDERSTANDING ON THE AMENDMENT REGARDING THE PRESS IS THE AUTHOR ALREADY INTENDED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THEY COULD USE IT FOR PUBLIC REASONS BUT- THE- ST PIERRE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE DRAFTING ON THE WAY IT WAS AND JUST WANTS TO FLIP THE LANGUAGE AROUND. I'M SORRY WHO WANTS TO FLIP THE- CALIFORNIA PRESS THE- SAN PA WANTED THE LANGUAGE TO BE CLEARER. SO INSTEAD OF RIGHT NOW IT READS. IT'S COULD BE READ TO BE LIMITED BY THE BAR NICKY CASE AND INSTEAD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THE PRESS IS USE OF THIS INFORMATION. FOR PUBLIC GOOD COULD BE USED. THAT WE TALK ABOUT REARRANGING THE SENTENCE A LITTLE BIT SO THAT YOU KNOW SUPPORT A PARTICULAR WORD GETS IN FRONT OF ANOTHER WORD SO WE ARE ACCEPTED NOT TO SO THIS IS IN CONNECTION WITH APPOINT A KEY CASE CORRECT TELL. TO I THINK THE KEY TO A YOU KNOW THE FOKKER PRESS FOLKS ARE FINE WITH THAT. THE YEAH WE ARE ACCEPTING. AND ON TOP OF THAT THE THREE AMENDMENTS SET TO OR WHAT PROPOSED BY THE CHAMBER AYE WE ACCEPTED ONE SO FAR. AND THEN WE STILL WORKING-ON THE AT THE OTHER TWO JUST A TO NARROW THE SCOPE BUT I DO UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE- ISSUE. DEFINITELY. THERE. I WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE AMENDMENT THAT. REGARDING THE- IT'S SPECIFIC THE LANGUAGES- REGARDING THE IT NIKKI VERSUS PROPER CASE AND- NOT LIMITING BE PROVIDING OR OBTAINING DATA IN AN OTHERWISE LAWFUL MANNER FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING COMPUTER SYSTEM OR DATA STORED IN A COMPUTER SYSTEM OR PROTECTING AN INDIVIDUAL FROM RISK OF IDENTITY OR FRAUD. I WOULD BE MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT AND I'M NOT SURE WHY I GUESS- DECEMBER TWO I'M NOT SURE WHAT. I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE OPPOSITION TO THAT AMENDMENT IS- IT'S SENATOR- D. CONCERN THAT I HAVE WITH T. E. SECOND PIECE OF WRITING THE FIRST PIECES ALREADY OKAY I MEAN I THINK UP UNTIL HE FINALLY THE SECOND PIECE DEALS WITH- DOES NOT LIMIT DOES NOT LIMIT PROVIDING OR OBTAINING DATA IN. AN OTHERWISE LAWFUL MANNER FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING A COMPUTER SYSTEM WHAT DATA IS STORED IN THE COMPUTER SYSTEM OR IT'S THE LATTER PART OF PROTECTING THE INDIVIDUAL FROM RISK OF IDENTITY THEFT WITH THE FRAUD I THINK IT IS THE LATTER PART OF THE SENTENCE AT DEAD TONIGHT YOU KNOW I LIKE TO KIND OF KNOW A LITTLE BIT COM ON. SO I THINK THE WORDS IDENTITY THEFT OR FRAUD I THINK COULD BE NARAL DELIBERATE EVEN MORE I THINK I'M OKAY WITH YOU KNOW THE ON THE FIRST PART OF THE SENTENCE BUT THE STOP TO LET YOU KNOW THE- SECOND PART OF IT I THINK WE CAN KIND OF. FINE TUNE A LITTLE BIT I THINK SO TELL ME WHAT THE ISSUES ARE FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW OF WHY. WE WOULDN'T WANT TO PROTECT. D. S. INDIVIDUAL FROM RISK IDENTITY THEFT OR FRAUD. IN OTHER WORDS WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THAT'S PERHAPS TOO BROAD I THINK I THINK THE FOR THE WAR FRAUD ITSELF OR IDENTITY THEFT. COULD BE CONSTRUED. ARE A LITTLE BIT TOO BROADLY- I THINK. IT MAY BE BROADER THAN THE SCENARIO THAT THEY ARE ENCOUNTERING WHICH IS LIKE I SAID. THEIR SITUATION IS SAYS IN HIS ATTY WOULD LIKE TO STAND THE DARK WEB FOR ANY POTENTIAL LEAKAGE OF FOSS ARE LET'S SAY INFORMATION. SO THAT THEY COULD RELATE THAT INFORMATION TO THEIR CLIENTS WHICH IS A TOTALLY LEGITIMATE. OPERATIONAL ROCEDURE. WHICH COULD BE NARROWER THAN YOU KNOW THE IDENTITY THEFT OR FRAUD. SO I'M HOPING TO EAT YOU KNOW THE COULD USE A DIFFERENT TERMINOLOGY. TO DESCRIBE THE SITUATION SO WE GOT A I'LL BE TOTALLY FINE SO. IT'S THOSE THREE WORDS I GUESS THAT THAT THAT WE COULD KINDA NARAL A LITTLE BIT MORE. OKAY YEAH BUT AS FAR AS THE FOR THE OF FORMER. PART OF THE SENTENCE I THINK I'M ALL FINE I THINK- THE BILL. I MEAN IT WAS ALREADY COME UP WITH. THIS BILL NOW WOULD GO TO A PROBE CISA NO NOT IT WOULD GO STRAIGHT TO THE FLOOR. OKAY HI- CHAIRED THE HEAD DID- I WONDERED IF- YOU AND COMMITTEE STAFF HAD TALKED ABOUT. THOSE ON TWO WORDS. EXACTLY. I'M SUPER JEWS EXACTLY- PASS THROUGH THE MOMENTS AND CLARIFYING AGAIN YOU'D TAKEN A TWO OF THE COMMITTEE AND I'M AND I GUESS THE WORD SMITHING THAT YOU'RE DOING AS RELATES TO FRAUD I'M AND I TO. NOW LORENA PLAY ONE ON TV I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT THE ISSUE IS HERE- BUT DTT ISSUE IS THAT- THE CHAMBER IS PROPOSING THIS PARTICULAR SET OF AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS A PARTICULAR SITUATION THAT THE- HEALTH. WHICH IS THE SCANNING OF THE DARK WEB FOR INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THEIR CLIENT AND THEY LIKE TO BE ABLE TO STAND CONTINUE SCANNING THE WEB FOR DARK THE DARK WEB FOR INFORMATION SO THAT THEY COULD RELATE THAT INFORMATION TO THE CLIENT AS PART OF THEIR CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. ZERO WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS TO PROPOSE THIS PARTICULAR A SENTENCE HERE TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION WHICH I THINK THE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS YOUR OBJECTION TO THAT I THINK THAT'S COMMONSENSE. A REQUEST THERE I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR OBJECTION TO THAT YEAH WHAT THE OBJECTION IS. THE THREE WORDS COULD BE CONSTRUED MORE BROADLY THAN THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION THAT WAS MY CONCERN SO I'M TRYING TO THINK OF A WORD OF WORDS THAT WOULD. EVEN NARROWER IS A LITTLE NARROW SO THAT IT COULD COVER DESPERATE SITUATION AND NOT TRY TO CREATE AN EXCEPTION THAT'S BROUGHT YOU KNOW TO BROUGHT TO BASICALLY EAT UP THE RULE. SO THAT'S THAT'S THE THAT'S THE CONCERN I MEAN. I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO DO THE LAW TO BE. TWO BROAD NUMBER ONE BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WON A COMEDY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO ILLEGITIMATE THINGS SO THAT'S THE DEAL GOT TO FIND FIVE DOLLARS I'M TRYING TO CREATE HERE. BUT IF WE CANNOT COME UP WITH THE BETTER TERMINOLOGY BETWEEN NOW AND APPROACH I THINK YOU KNOW ALL- YOU'RE GOING TO APPROACH. I'M SORRY I TO FLOOR WE STILL HAVE TO ACTUALLY TO AMENDMENTS TO MAKE AND THAT IS TO CREATE A REMEDY AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES NOT CREATE CRIME TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY WE WILL DO THE DOES TOO. SO WE STILL NEED TO AMEND THE BILL SO TO SPEAK. AND YOU CAN TO PUT THE AMENDMENT IN THERE. SO I THINK WE'RE 90% THERE MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS- AND. YOU KNOW. I JUST WANT TO. PUT LANGUAGE TURNED THERE TO ACCOUNTS FOR THAT BUT- SAID. TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR THEY'RE ALL YOU KNOW. TOTALLY LAWFUL. THE. IT HERE IF THE COMMITTEE IS WILLING TO SUGGEST LANGUAGE BETWEEN NOW AND THE FLOOR- ALL GAME. SO LET'S BE CLEAR. YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE WORD FRAUD. FRAUD AND IDENTITY THEFT CITING BRO ONE WE LEAVE IDENTITY THEFT AND THEN TAKE FRAUD OUT- THAT'S PROBABLY BETTER. YEAH WITH THAT. OKAY WITH YOU CENTERS GONNA. I MEAN IF NOT WERE PROPOSING HOLDING THIS AND CONTINUE WORK ON BEFORE WE LET IT OUT OF COMMITTEE SO IT JUST SEEMS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS SO WE HAVEN'T COME TO A REAL AGREEMENT ON AN- I THINK WE'RE SORRY I THINK WE'RE 90% THERE I MEAN AS FAR AS BUILDING COMPLETE CONSENSUS SO. SO YOU'RE GOOD WITH REMOVING THE WORD FRAUD AND EVEN IDENTITY TOOK THAT OFF AND THEN. WITH THE CHAMBERS AMENDMENTS AND THEN THE TWO THAT WE ARE PROPOSED HERE AND MY- HEARING THAT CORRECTLY YEAH HE ESSENTIALLY OKAY- SENATOR CAN I LET ME JUST VERIFY TO CAN YOU CLARIFY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT. YOU'RE A CIVIL REMEDY YOU INTEND TO PUT IN AS- THERE WERE TWO CHOICES I THINK ONE WAS TO REFER TO- BE IN P. SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED. WHICH HAS BEEN ADDRESSING THE ANALYSIS THE OTHER IS TO ALLOW THE COURT TO- GRANT INJECTIONS IF THEY SO DESIRE. ON AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING AMENDMENTS IN COMMITTEE WHICH AMENDMENT ARE YOU SUGGESTING YOU'RE TAKING ALL THE OF THE LATTER OKAY THE LATTER WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL NOT CREATE NEW CRIME. OKAY YES YEAH I THINK THAT'S THE INTENT I MEAN I. DON'T WANT TO CREATE NEW CRIME IF I COULD AVOID IT- ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS YEAH COMMITTEE I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT I ONLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. BECAUSE IF THERE WERE AMENDMENTS OUTSIDE OF WHAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED. I'M NOT SURE WHERE THOSE WOULD HAPPEN AND SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE ARE LANDING ON WHATEVER THE MEMBERS ARE NOW R WHETHER. WE SHOULD HOLD FOR A WEEK IN ORDER TO LAND SO THAT WERE VOTING ON A BILL THAT CAN GO TO THE FLOOR. SO I GUESS MY QUESTION THE CONSULTANT WOULD GIVEN THE QUESTION YOU JUST STASHED. THAT CLARIFIED WHICH CIVIL CODE SECTION WAS BEING MODIFIED. OR I DO WANNA SUMMARIZE THEIR MOMENTS AS I UNDERSTAND THEM YES PLEASE OKAY SO. THE N. UNLAWFUL BE DEFINED THAT HIS STAFF ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE REGARDING A CIVIL INJUNCTION- ENFORCED BY THE- A DA OR AN ATTORNEY GENERAL'S MY UNDERSTANDING- THEN. WE ARE GOING TO FIX THE LANGUAGE PUT THE LANGUAGE AROUND REGARDING THE PRESSES RIGHT TO ACCESS AND WE WILL TAKE THE CHAMBER AMENDMENT IN D. MINUS THE WORD OR FRAUD. THE WORDS ARE FRAUD. COULD WE NOT HOLD THIS MEASURE UNTIL NEXT WEEK AND GET THE ALL CLEAR FAR TOO I THINK ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO BE A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE WITH THE- MEASURE. WE CAN DO THAT WE HAVE YEAH BILLS BUT WE CAN I WOULD I WOULD PROPOSE THAT WEEK KID. THIRTY ON WERE GOING HERE AND IS HOLDS MEASURE OVER UNTIL NEXT WEEK. TO WHICH CAN GET A COMPLETE AGREEMENT ON OVER HERE ARE ALSO JUST. I'VE HEARD ME IT. I THINK JUST TO SEE THE LANGUAGE BECAUSE FOR ME IT'S HARD TO ENVISION. THAT CHANGE CALCULATIONS WHEN WE'RE MAKING THESE KINDS OF AMENDMENT RECOMMENDATIONS YOU KNOW ON THE YOU KNOW HERE IN COMMITTEE- SO I WOULD BE OKAY WITH THAT BECAUSE AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING IT AND ACTUALLY BECOMES MORE CONFUSING TO ME. I MEAN MY UNDER I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT WAS. ILLEGAL TO DO ALL OF THESE THINGS ANYWAY TO SELL DATA I MEAN IT'S ILLEGAL TO HAPPEN TO SOMEONE SYSTEM INTO LEGAL TO SELL SOMEONE FOR PRIDE JERRY INFORMATION. YEAH IT IS UNDER THE LAW UNDER THIS BILL WHICH STRUCTURE TRYING TO CREATE SOME OF THOSE EXCEPTIONS- I GUESS FROM TO ACCOMMODATE LAWFUL ACTIVITIES- AND WHICH IS ONE OF WHICH IS BROUGHT UP BY THE CHAMBER SO YEAH IT IS IT SHOULD BE ILLEGAL AND TO SELL AND TO BUY DATA THAT'S BEEN HACKED WE'RE LOOKING ACTUALLY AT THE- THE THIRD PARTY PEOPLE THESE ARE THE DOWNSTREAM PEOPLE WHO WANT TO CONTINUE SELLING THE DATA DATE YOU KNOW THAT'S BEEN HACKED AND SOLD. SO IT IS A MARKET PLACE OUT THERE THAT WE WANT TO STOP SO- SO TELL ME THIS. YEAR- YOU KNOW. ARM WE ALL HAVE JUST BECOME. YOU KNOW BITS OF DATA AND CODES AND INFORMATION. AND THERE ARE EITHER ALGORITHMS OR COMPANIES THAT ARE. TAKING OUR DATA THAT WE'RE FREELY GIVING EVERY TIME WE CLICK A BUTTON OR MAKE A PURCHASE SIX CETERA. I DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHO OWNS THAT BUT THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT THEN COLLECT VAST AND THEN SELL THEM TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT USE THAT DATA TO THEN CONTINUE TO MARKET TO US TO SELL US THINGS. IS NOT DARK WEB ACTIVITY BUT HOW WOULD THIS IMPACT THAT BECAUSE COULD YOU THEN ENTER DOWN YOU KNOW ENTER INTO DISCUSSIONS ABOUT IF THAT IS LAWFUL OR NOT BECAUSE THAT. I MEAN THAT IS USING DATA THAT YOU HAVE AN EXPLICITLY AUTHORIZED SOMEONE TO USE AND IT IS BEING COMPILED- AND SOLD OR SHARED. TO COMPANIES OTHER THAN USING IT. NUMBER SO HOW DOES THIS IMPACT THE VAST WITH THIS MAKE THOSE KINDS OF EXCHANGES UNLAWFUL. FOR A FEW YEARS AGO IT HAS THE- HISTORIC CITY PA THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH WOULD BASICALLY GIVE THE CONSUMER THE RIGHT TO. YOU KNOW SAY YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE RIGHT. TO KNOW WHAT DATA IS BEING COLLECTED FROM YOU AND YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY NO TO PEOPLE SELLING YOUR INFORMATION ASSURING YOUR INFORMATION. AND THEN A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE ALSO PASSED A LAW REGARDING DATA BROKERS SO WE ARE BASICALLY PROHIBITING YOU KNOW THE DARK WEB- YOU. FOLKS IN SELLING OR MAKING PER. OF THE INTO. THAT YOU KNOW THAT'S A- ILLEGALLY. AND THIS IS JUST TO CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE. TO SO- CURRENTLY IT IS ILLEGAL TO HACK INTO SOMEBODY'S. COMPUTER FOR DATA FOR EXAMPLE SO THAT'S ALREADY COVERED UNDER ANOTHER CODE SECTION. BUT THE DATA THAT HAS BEEN CALLED. HACKED INTO AND SOUL SUBSEQUENTLY FURTHER DOWNSTREAM. AND THAT'S NOT. ILLEGAL INDUCTEE OF THE LAW IS SILENT ON DOT SUIT THIS BILL WILL BASICALLY CLOSE THAT LOOPHOLE BY SAYING LOOK IF YOU'RE DOWNSTREAM FOLKS WHO OBTAIN THE HACKED INFORMATION HE SHOULD NOT. RESELL IT OR YOU SHOULD NOT PURCHASE WE SHOULD NOT SELL OR USE IT. SO WE'RE TRYING TO KIND OF. YOU KNOW OF SOLVE THE PROBLEM FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES TO MAKE SURE THAT KIND WE WEED OUT THE YOU KNOW THE ILLEGAL ORDERS YOU KNOW THAT. THESE PEOPLE OUT THERE. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU. WELL I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU HARNESS THE DARK WEB I THINK THAT'S LIKE THE INTENT OF THE DARK WEB. WELL I MEAN IT'S IT HAS A GOOD QUESTION BUT YET IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S A QUESTION THAT REALLY- DESERVES A LITTLE MORE DISCUSSION AND LOOKING INTO- YOU KNOW THE DARK WHERE WEB IS THE DARK WEB I MEAN I THINK- BUT- IN. WHICH TRYING TO FIX THE PROBLEM AS MUCH AS WE CAN- BUT BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION WHERE THE CHAMBER BROUGHT OUT. OF THEY ARE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING DOUBTS OF. WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF YOU KNOW LET'S SAY IF A NATION THAT THEY OBTAIN OUT THERE WHICH YOU KNOW COULD COULD BE POTENTIALLY AFFECT I GUESS I YOU KNOW SO. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO FIX ALL THE PROBLEMS OF THE SO WE HAVE TO KIND OF DO IT ONE YOU KNOW ONE PIECE AT A TIME SO- TO THAT'S THE INTENT I MEAN SO THIS IS A VERY MODEST BILL INTO TO BEGIN WITH. I THINK THIS IS OUR THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK- IT'S STILL A LOT OF. QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AS RELATES TO THE BILL AS IT IS TODAY AND WHERE WE ARE ON A LANDING. THOSE SAID AMENDMENTS AND GETTING BETTER CLARITY AS TO. WHAT THE BILL'S. REAL INTENT TO SELL ARTISANAL OBJECTION WILL HOLD THOSE OFF TILL. NEXT WEEK. L. OKAY SOUNDS GOOD TO US IN OUR SKINNER. I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK- I THINK WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND I THINK MUCH OF WHAT'S BEEN ARTICULATED BUT IT IS HELPFUL FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SEE IT JUST BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GO TO ANY OTHER COMMITTEE SO- AND I THINK THE- SUGGESTION. OF REMOVING FRAUD. IS A GOOD ONE AND YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH SO BUT AT LEAST IT ALLOWS US TO SEE IT BEFORE WE ACTUALLY DOOR FOR ME TO VOTE. SO PRECIADO. I TRY. YOUR FINE WITH THAT AS CHAU THE FORTY WORKING WITH YOU- IN A COUPLE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE WORKING WORKING ON THIS MATTER TWO WE CAN BRING IT TO A POINT WHERE MEMBERS ARE COMFORTABLE WITH I GET A RIGHT ERRORS.
