MEMBERS HAVE PRIORITIES TO THE FRONT ROW JUST SO YOU KNOW IN THIS COMMITTEE. SO -- I I JUST WANTED TO CONFIRM THAT OF AB TWELVE AND THREE FORTY WERE PULLED. YES OKAY. SO GOOD MORNING HOW -- CHAIR JONES SAWYER AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM HAPPY TO PRESENT TO AB THREE THREE NINE TWO THIS MORNING WHICH WOULD REQUIRE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. TO HAVE POLICIES AND STANDARDS RELATING TO GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS. THIS IS ONE OF A PACKAGE OF BILLS THIS SESSION IN RESPONSE TO THE BORDERLINE SHOOTING IN MY DISTRICT WHICH TOOK THE LIVES OF TWELVE OF MY CONSTITUENTS. OF LAST FALL I SPENT THE LAST FEW MONTHS WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO DEVELOP LEGISLATION. THAT HOPEFULLY WILL HELP AVOID ANOTHER TRAGEDY LIKE THE ONE INFLICTED UPON. OUR COMMUNITY GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS ARE OR G. V. R. OWES AS MANY OF YOU KNOW OUR A NEW TOOL. THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS CREATED TO PRO ACTIVELY INTERVENE IN DANGEROUS SITUATIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. ACHIEVE YARO ALLOWS A FAMILY MEMBER OR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO DEFUSE DANGEROUS SITUATION A DANGEROUS SITUATION BY REMOVING FIRE ARMS FROM THE EQUATION. UNFORTUNATELY TOO MANY JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA DO NOT KNOW THAT THIS TOOL EXISTS. AS THE COMMITTEES AND ALICE'S SHOWS THE GROWTH OF G. OF EURO ISSUANCE HAS BEEN SLOW WITH LAST YEAR ONLY SEEING. A FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY ISSUED FURTHERMORE ONLY A HANDFUL OF JURISDICTIONS ARE -- ISSUING THEM THE LINE SHARE WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED IS FROM SAN DIEGO. AND TWENTY OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HAVE NEVER ISSUED. ONE AB THREE THREE NINE WOULD PROVIDE A JUMPSTART TO LAW ENFORCEMENT'S AWARENESS OF THIS TOOL. BY REQUIRING LOCAL DEPARTMENTS TO WORK WITH GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION EXPERTS AND MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. TO DEVELOP POLICIES AND STANDARDS THIS PROCESS WILL RESULT IN BOTH COMMAND STAFF A ON PATROL OFFICERS WERE ACQUIRING THE KNOWLEDGE NEEDED TO USE TV ARE OWES. AND TO BE PROACTIVE IN KEEPING OUR COMMUNITIES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I FELT MEMBERS. YES YOU HAVE WITNESSES A WITNESS NO WITNESSES -- I'M SORRY I DIDN'T. OKAY WE DO HAVE A WITNESS. HI I'M AMANDA WILCOX HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE AND I SHOULD ANNOUNCE THAT WE ARE NAME CHANGING OUR NAME. TO BRADY CALIFORNIA. UNITED AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE SO YOU'LL START SEEING THAT IN THE FUTURE -- WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE IMPLEMENTED IMPLEMENTATION OF THE G. R. CALIFORNIA'S COMBINES RESTRAINING ORDER LAW. I SINCE AB TEN FOURTEEN WAS ENACTED IN -- TWENTY FOURTEEN AS YOU'VE HEARD -- THE STATISTICS IT HAS NOT USED AROUND CALIPHS ROUTE CALIFORNIA. AND WE BELIEVE UNDER USE AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REASONS FOR THAT WE HAVE DONE SOME CLEAN UP LEGISLATION IN THE PAST WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. BUT CLEARLY ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT -- LAW ENFORCEMENT IS EITHER NOT BEEN AWARE OF THE LAW -- DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW CAN FILL GAPS IN EXISTING LAW PARTICULARLY WHEN OF CHIEF EURO WOULD BE USED INSTEAD OF A FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD. AND THEY LACK A PROCESS FOR IMPLEMENTING THE LAW IN THEIR OWN JURISDICTION AND I CERTAINLY FOUND THIS TO BE THE CASE IN MY COUNTY NEVADA COUNTY WHEN I APPROACH LAW ENFORCEMENT ABOUT IT. FIRST THING THEY SAID WAS WELL WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A PROCESS FOR OUR COUNTY THAT WORKS FOR OUR COUNTY EACH COUNTIES DIFFERENT PER TRICKLING FOR RURAL COUNTIES WHERE I LIVE IN URBAN COUNTIES -- THAT'S ON EVERYONE'S WISHLIST ATTENDS NOT TO HAPPEN UNLESS THERE IS LEGISLATION REQUIRING IT -- AND WE FEEL THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF GETTING THIS LAW INCOME FULLY IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA IN REALIZING THE LIFESAVING BENEFITS OF REMOVING FIREARMS FROM PEOPLE. WHO ARE ARE BRISK OF DANGEROUS NOUS SO I WOULD URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU? THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME IN ORGANIZATION PLEASE. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. PUT WEIGHT. GOOD MORNING DANIELLE CANDOR BECAUSE OUR BEHALF OF THE EFFORTS LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. DONNA SITES REPRESENTING LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING ELIZABETH ESPINOSA HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF COURSE THE SIDE OF THE BORDER LINE SHOOTING AND SUPPORT ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE SANTA CRUZ COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THANK YOU THANK YOU. CALVIN QUICK BAY AREA STUDENT ACTIVISTS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU ARE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HAVE A SEAT. GOOD MORNING MY FIRST APPEARANCE THIS YEAR GOOD TO SEE EVERYONE -- CAPULETS REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION UP FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO SAY THE CERTAINLY WE SUPPORT THE POLICY HERE AND ACTUALLY I ACTUALLY. AGREE WITH THE BRADY CAMPAIGN ON THE PATCHWORK QUILT OUR CONCERN INITIALLY -- REPRESENTING SPORTS MEN AND AND SHOOTERS THAT TRAVEL TO AND FROM -- RANGES IS THAT YOU HAVE -- NOT STATE PREEMPTION HERE THAT THE AMENDMENTS MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BILL BY PUTTING IN WRITTEN POLICIES AND STANDARDS -- TO PRIVATE PROVIDE SOME CONSISTENCY HOWEVER IT REALLY DOESN'T MANDATE THAT THE COMMISSION DEVELOP THE COURSE WORK ON OR THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT TAKE THE COURTS WORK SO IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME STANDARDIZATION TO THOSE WE WOULD ENCOURAGE -- THE BILL AND THE COMMITTEE -- TO CONSIDER THAT AS THE BILL MOVES ALONG THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER QUIRK -- IT'S ALL BE VOTING FOR YOUR BILL TODAY I THINK IT'S A GOOD ONE I THINK WE DO I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT. PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW MORE -- BUT WE'RE ALSO WORRIED ABOUT OFFICERS -- JUST HAVING SO MUCH TRAINING THEY DON'T GET OUT ON THE STREETS I THINK THIS IS A GOOD COMPROMISE. THAT YOU HAVE STANDARDS -- PEOPLE GET. SEE THEM WITHOUT TAKING -- A VERY VERY LONG TIME TO TRAIN IT CETERA SO. HI -- DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT STANDARDIZATION IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WOULD TO A PLAN TO DO -- OVER LOOK AT IF THEY YOU'VE GOT SUGGESTIONS -- FROM THE OPPOSITION. AS SO FIRST I IRA APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS WE'VE WE'VE FOUND THAT A LOT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS NOT AWARE AND BUT WE REALLY WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT EVERY. COUNTY REACHES OUT TO THE ACTIVISTS GROUPS. AND MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN THEIR COUNTY TO VISUAL POLICIES OF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GABRIEL HAS A BILL TO REQUIRE -- POST TRAINING WITH G. V. R. OWES BUT EVEN WITHOUT THAT BILL WE HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY ARE GOING TO START TO IMPLEMENT TRAINING THROUGH POST ON TV ARE -- SO I DON'T THINK THAT'S MORE OF THE STANDARDIZATION OUR CONCERN IS THAT THAT THAT COULD TAKE UP TO FIVE YEARS TO IMPLEMENT AND RIGHT NOW. WE THINK IT'S VERY PRESSING FOR EACH DEPARTMENT -- TO DEVELOP POLICIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO -- DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN DO IN TERMS OF STANDARDISATION THE OPPOSITION'S -- CONCERN [inaudible] OF I THINK THAT'S THE I THINK DEVELOPING TRAINING THROUGH POST IS REALLY. IS IS -- THE BEST WAY TO ACHIEVE THAT AND AGAIN EACH INDIVIDUAL COUNTY HAS -- YOU KNOW DIFFERENT CONSTITUENCY AND AND WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALLOW THEM TO DEVELOP POLICIES THAT WORK FOR THEIR CONSTITUENCY. OKAY -- I'LL MOVE THE BILL THANK YOU. THE SECOND IS BEEN MOVING STATE OR ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I TO WILL BE SUPPORTING -- THIS BILL IN I THANK YOU -- FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD EIGHT A I WOULD RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE BOTH INCONSISTENCIES WITH THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF AGENCIES THAT ALREADY HAVE POLICIES LIKE THIS IN EXISTENCE -- AND ALSO RECOGNIZE CHALLENGES THAT SOME AGENCIES MAY HAVE IN ACTUALLY DEVELOPING SOUND POLICIES THAT THEY UNDERSTAND -- AND SO THAT IS MY HOPE WITH THESE AND OTHER KINDS OF BILLS THAT NOT ONLY ARE WE FOCUSING ON HAVING POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT ARE DESIGNED. BUT ALSO HELPING -- LAW ENFORCEMENT UNDERSTAND HOW TO DESIGN. GOOD POLICIES AND HELPING THEM COMPREHEND WHAT IT IS BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING TO JUST HAVE SOMETHING ON THE BOOKS AND YOU SAY HEY THIS IS THE PROTOCOL THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE. BUT IT'S ANOTHER THING TO HAVE FOLKS ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE POLICIES MEAN AND HOW TO IMPLEMENT THEM AND HOW TO GET HELP AND CONTINUING TO MAKE THE RELEVANT SO I'M CERTAINLY HOPING THAT THIS CAN BE A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION. I ALSO KIND OF CAUTION AGAINST SB EXPEDIENCY ALWAYS WITHOUT COMPREHENSION WE RUSHED TO KIND OF GET THINGS IN PLACE WITHOUT RECOGNIZING THAT THERE'S TRAINING AND EDUCATION THAT HAS TO HAPPEN ON THE FRONT AND SO THANK YOU FOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY YOU MAY CLOSE MISSOURI -- JUST REQUEST AN AYE VOTE PLEASE IN AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND CHAIRS RECOMMENDING AND I CALL THE ROLL. ON AB THREE THREE NINE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER I LACKEY. LACKEY AYE BARRICADE HAN BARRICADE HAND I DEEP I DEEP I KAMLAGER-DOVE UP.

WE HAVE MISTER HE FLOOR AB FOUR OH ONE ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN WITH PROPS. A VERY VISUAL PERSON. I ONLY TO IT MAYBE COULD BRING IT A LITTLE CLOSER SO THAT. ARE ON THAT SIDE SO THAT WAS THE WHOLE COMMITTEE CAN SEE IT. THIS IS MY ARE FOR REFERENCE OF YEAH I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU YOU WENT TO A LOT OF X.. TROUBLE TO GET THAT DONE I WANNA MAKE SURE EVERYONE SEES IT PERFECT. WELL THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS WERE HERE TO PRESENT AB. FOUR OH ONE WHICH MAKE SOMEBODY'S FIFTY YOU WHY A FELONY. AB FOR ONE STEM FROM A SHERIFF DEPUTY IN MY DISTRICT WHO LOST HIS LIFE IN PURSUIT OF A DRUNK DRIVER. WHO HAD FIVE PRIOR DO YOU EYES IT ALSO STEMS FROM A STRING OF THE I. RELATED? TRAFFIC FELONIES FATALITIES INJURIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. TOUGHER SANCTIONS CAN BE HARD TO VOTE I UNDERSTAND THAT THE HISTORY SHOWN IS THAT SOMETIMES THESE HARD VOTER EFFECTIVE UNNECESSARY. IN ORDER TO PROTECT OUR CONSTITUENTS. VIEW THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST FOUR ONE HAVE BEEN FELONIES ARE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN MISDEMEANORS FELONIES HAVE SEVERE CONSEQUENCES THE HARDSHIP OF PENALTIES ON DEFENDANTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THESE ARGUMENTS A WIFE WHO HAS LOST HER HUSBAND DOESN'T CARE HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS TO PROSECUTE A FELONY. CHILDREN HAVE LOST THEIR MOTHER DON'T CARE HOW SEVERE THE CONSEQUENCES ARE. YOU'VE LOST A CHILD DON'T CARED TO CONSIDER THE HARDSHIPS ON OF THE PENALTIES ON A DRUNK DRIVER. WHAT'S MORE SOMEONE WHO WAS ON THEIR FIFTY WHY DOESN'T CARE. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THEMSELVES DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE MISDEMEANOR VIOLATION. THEY CERTAINLY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE INNOCENT MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN THAT SHARE THE ROAD WITH THEM. PARTS OF ALSO DISCUSSED REMOVAL JUDICIAL DISCRETION IS BEING UNNECESSARY. DOES A FIFTY Y. WARRANTS A FELONY CHARGE JUDGES WILL CHARGE THEM THAT IF A FIFTY AND DO YOU AYE WARRANTY FELONY CHARGE. THE JUDGES WILL CHARGE IS A FELONY IF NOT THEY WILL CHARGE AS A MISDEMEANOR. I WOULD ARGUE SOMEONE WHO IS CHOSEN TO DRIVE DRUNK ON FIVE SEPARATE OCCASIONS SHOULD NEVER WARRANT A MISDEMEANOR CHARGE. THE PERSON IS WILLFULLY AND REPEATEDLY ENDANGERING OTHERS. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FIRST YOU Y.. OR THE SECOND THE THIRD. FOR THE FOURTH. WE TALK ABOUT SOMEONE HAS MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO FIVE TIMES. TO DRIVE AND DRIVE DRUNK. CONSEQUENCE ON THE FIFTY WHY SHOULD BE SEVERE AB FOUR ONE TAKES COMMONSENSE STEPS TOWARDS ENHANCING PENALTIES TO ESTABLISH% SERIOUS REPERCUSSIONS FOR REPEAT OFFENDERS TO A VERY SERIOUS CRIME. EVERY SINGLE TIME SOMEONE CHOOSES TO DRIVE DRUNK VERY MORTAL DANGER TO THEMSELVES AND EVERY SINGLE AS A MAN WOMAN AND CHILD ON THE ROAD WITH THEM. THOUSANDS OF LIVES HAVE BEEN LOST YOU CAN'T BRING THEM BACK. AND I BELIEVE ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. THIS BILL IS RECEIVED SUPPORT FROM LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT INCLUDING CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. FOR PEACE OFFICE ASSOCIATION CITY MANTECA POLICE DEPARTMENT CITY OF RICHMOND POLICE DEPARTMENT ESCON POLICE DEPARTMENT RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION THE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. AND STANISLAUS COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. HERE TO TESTIFY WITH ME IS MY COUNTY SHERIFF SO WE CAN COUNTY SHERIFF PATRICK WITH REAL. WELCOME SIR GOOD MORNING THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS MY FIRST TIME EVER TESTIFYING IN FRONT OF A A COMMITTEE AND I APPRECIATE BEING HERE. COURSE I'VE ONLY BEEN A SURE FOR ABOUT TEN WEEKS. SO HOPEFULLY I'LL BE BACK A LOT OF TIMES -- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO COME TESTIFY THIS MORNING. YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S IT'S INTERESTING TO ME WHEN ASSEMBLYMAN FLORA CONTACTED ME ABOUT THIS IT. IT KIND OF SEEMS LIKE A NO BRAINER TO ME YOU KNOW AND AND I'VE BEEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS NOW. AND AND I COME TO SPEAK NOT NECESSARILY AS A GUY WHO'S DONE A LOT OF THE U. I. ARRESTS BECAUSE IN AS AS MOST OF YOU MUST KNOW -- THE SHERIFF'S DON'T DO DO YOU AYE ARREST WE PULL THEM OVER WE WE CHECK IN IF WE THINK SOMEBODY'S -- UNDER THE INFLUENCE WE PASSING OVER TO TO C. H. P. THEY COME IN AND HANDLE THAT FORCE BECAUSE THEY'RE THE EXPERTS ON THAT -- BUT I HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN DO YOU EYES BECAUSE I WORKED IN ONE OF OUR CONTRACTS CITIES. AND I'VE SEEN THE IMPACT THAT IT HAD IS IS AS A DEPUTY CORONER. I'M THE ONE WHO GOES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND KNOCKS ON THE DOOR. AND TELL THE FAMILY THEIR LOVED ONES NOT COMING HOME. AND I'VE DONE THAT MANY MANY TIMES IN MY CAREER AND I CAN TELL YOU I REMEMBER EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. I'LL CARRY THOSE WITH ME FOREVER -- SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE THE THE PAIN THAT A FAMILY FEELS WHEN THEY LOSE A LOVED ONE IN ANY MANNER -- BUT TO HEAR THAT IT WAS FROM SOMEBODY. WHO WAS ON THEIR FIFTH OR MORE DO YOU WHY BECAUSE WE HAVE TO REMEMBER? JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S BEEN ARRESTED FIVE TIMES FOR DRIVING AND THEIR INFLUENCE THERE ARE PROBABLY HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF TIMES THEY'VE DRIVEN. AND GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT. I BELIEVE THE STATISTIC IS ON A FRIDAY OR SATURDAY NIGHT -- ONE IN EVERY TEN CARS AROUND YOU HAS SOMEBODY UNDER THE INFLUENCE DRIVING. SO -- AFTER FIVE TIMES IN A AND I'M IN FAVOR OF REHABILITATION I USED TO RUN OUR INTERNAL -- ARE ALTERNATIVE WORK PROGRAMS IN OUR HOME DETENTION PROGRAMS I WAS THE ONE TO PUT POLICIES IN PLACE TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO COME OUT OF JAIL. AND I COULD MONITOR THEM BY PUTTING ALCOHOL BRACELETS ON THEM TO FREE UP THOSE PRISON CELLS -- IN JAIL CELLS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT SHOOTING AND STABBING AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT OUR CITIZENS -- BUT WHEN YOU GET TO YOUR FIFTY WHY EVEN THE GUYS THAT I PUT THE ANKLE BRACELET ON THEY DRANK THEY GO OUTAND DRINK KNOWING THAT I'M GOING TO BE -- MEDIATE LEE NOTIFIED THAT THEY HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DRINK IT'S A IT IS A SICKNESS IT'S AN ILLNESS WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE TO TREAT IT. BUT AT SOME POINT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO DRAW THE LINE AND SAY ANALYSIS ON NOT YOU HAVE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN WHEN WE GET PEOPLE INTO CUSTODY. THAT'S WHEN THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRY OUT TO CHANGE THEIR LIFE TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS A LOT OF THEM DO THAT THEY'LL THEY'LL THEY'LL GET THE HELP THEY NEED. AND THEN THEY'LL RELAPSE AND IT'LL HAPPEN AGAIN BUT AFTER FIVE TIMES IT'S IT'S A POINT WHERE WE JUST HAVE TO SAY AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO HELP PEOPLE AND AS MUCH AS WE WANT -- TO FREE UP CELLS AND NOT PEOPLE IN THE PUT CUSTODY -- IN CUSTODY THAT DON'T NEED TO BE THERE. WE IS LAWMAKERS AND WE AS THE PEOPLE IN A FORCE LAWS HAVE TO DRAW THE LINE AND JUST SAY HEY WE'VE TRIED EVERYTHING TO HELP YOU THERE HAS TO BE A CONSEQUENCE FOR THIS BEFORE WE HAVE ONE MORE FAMILY MEMBER KILLED. SO THAT'S WHY I'M HERE IS A ATTIC SHERIFF IN MY COUNTY CITY NEXT TO MY V. REPUBLICAN FRIEND. AND THIS IS NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE THIS IS A COMMON SENSE ISSUE THAT SAYS HEY LOOK WE ARE GOING TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO HELP THESE FOLKS ONCE WE GET HIM IN CUSTODY TO GET HIM. TO GET HIM THE HELP THEY NEED SO THAT THEY DON'T DRINK ANYMORE. BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO GO OUT AND SLAUGHTER FAMILIES ANYMORE SO THANK YOU FOR MY TIME HERE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS ARE THERE ANY OTHERS IN [inaudible] SUPPORT. OF AB. FOUR ONE NAME AN ORGANIZATION. SURE MEMBERS JONATHON FELDMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU [inaudible] THERE ANYONE. ELSE IN SUPPORT MORE THE MORNING MIST TERRAIN SHERMAN RIVERSIDE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU. EITHER THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. OF THE BILL. GOOD MORNING I SEE THREE PEOPLE HE'S. YOU STILL. IS. STILL ONLY HAVE FIVE MINUTES YOU. HOW YOU WANT TO DIVVY IT UP IS SURE OKAY. GOOD MORNING -- KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA -- WE RESPECTFULLY MUST OPPOSE A BEFORE A ONE WHICH WOULD DENY JUDGES THE DISCRETION TO DETERMINE WHETHER A PARTICULAR DO YOU WHY WHEN THE DEFENDANT HAS A RECORD. PASSED YOU EYES WARRANTS PUNISHMENT AS A FELONY. THAT MEANS THAT THE PENALTIES THIS BILL SEEKS TO IMPOSE ARE AVAILABLE NOW IN THOSE CASES. THE DISCRETION THAT EGG IS GIVEN UNDER SIMPLY INSURES THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CURRENT OFFENSE AND THE DEFENDANT'S HISTORY ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN SENTENCES IMPOSED. A BEFORE A ONE MAKE SIMILAR CHANGES. DENYING COURT DISCRETION -- WITH REGARD TO WHETHER -- A VEHICLE USED IN CERTAIN OFFENSES IS TO BE DECLARED A NEW SENSE -- AND SUBJECTS MANY MORE PEOPLE TO HAVING THEIR CARS IMPOUNDED WHEN THEY'VE GONE MORE THAN FIVE YEARS WITHOUT A RELEVANT TO FANS. THESE CHANGES WILL DO NOTHING TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF OUR ROADS BUT WILL IMPOSE COSTS THE COSTLY AUTOMATED APPROACH TO PUNISHMENT. CALIFORNIA HAS ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN TO TURN AWAY FROM THE PATH OF HARSH SENTENCES LEADING TO OVER INCARCERATION AN OVERCROWDED PRISON SYSTEM THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD NOT TURN BACK TOWARDS THOSE HARSH POLICIES. AND ESPECIALLY NOT BY TYING JUDGES HANDS AND KEEPING THEM FROM CHOOSING THE MOST JUST RESPONSE IN A GIVEN CASE. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MARGO GEORGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION -- I ECHO THE COMMENTS THAT MEASURE MADE FROM THE ACLU AND I WANT TO SAY THAT ON FIRST I UNDERSTAND THE PAIN THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OF DEALING WITH PEOPLE WHO WERE IF ANA. THE VICTIMS OF THE THE WISE. AND BUT ALSO -- THIS AS YOU ACKNOWLEDGE IS A SICKNESS ON ALCOHOLISM IS A DISEASE. AND HARSHER PUNISHMENT WILL NOT PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM ALCOHOL -- ABUSE. WITH THAT I WOULD STAY ON TO SAY THAT THE FAILED MODEL OF INCREASED INCARCERATION. REQUIRING THAT MORE DO YOU WISE BE CHARGED AS A FELONY AS FELONIES HAS NOT WORKED. UNDER THE CURRENT ALL LAW THE PROSECUTORS NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT. AND THEY EXERCISE THEIR DISCRETION AS THEY SEE FIT. ON THIS WOULD TAKE AWAY BOTH THE DISCRETION OF THE PROSECUTORS AND THE DISCRETION OF JUDGES TO SENATE'S AND THE APPROPRIATE CASE. ON THE EFFECTS OF THE FELONY CONVICTION AREN'T LIFELONG. THEY AFFECT THE PERSON'S ABILITY TO WORK THE PERSON'S ABILITY TO HAVE HOUSING THEY AFFECT THE COMMUNITY [inaudible] THE OTHER ASPECTS OF THIS BILL WHICH ARE REALLY HARMFUL ARE THE MANDATORY HELMET -- THAT. IMPOUNDING SOMEONE'S VEHICLE FOR NINETY DAYS IN MANY CASES FOR POOR PEOPLE AS THE EQUIVALENT OF FORFEITURE. AND THAT'S NOT EVEN DEALING WITH THE FACT THAT THIS -- ON A PROPOSED BILL HAS FORFEITURE THAT. OF LOSING A CAR TO THE AVERAGE FAMILY. IS -- DEVASTATING IN MOST COMMUNITIES YOU CANNOT GET TO WORK OR SCHOOL. ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION OUTSIDE OF THE OF FOR THOSE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU [inaudibl] THANK YOU. SO YOU GOT. THAT OKAY NEEDED TO HAVE A GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN PROJECT NOT SIR HERNANDEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TERMS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE. STATEWIDE SO EFFICIENT COALITION SLURS BOTH IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AND WORK IN A PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICES WE ARE ALSO RESPECTFULLY ENOUGH -- OPPOSITION TO THE BILL UP REALLY ARE OPPOSITION IS VERY NARROW. WE ARE CONCERNED WITH ELIMINATING THE DISCRETION THAT EXISTS NOW CURRENT LAW. THE EXPERIENCE OF OUR ATTORNEYS THAT IT'S VERY RARE WHEN A JUDGE REVIEW DA'S GOING TO TAKE. EXCUSE ME CAN EXERCISE DISCRETION NOT CHARGE A FELONY IN WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE HAS YOU KNOW I THINK WE TALK ABOUT FIVE IN THE BILL PLACE A FOR MORE. TO THE DISCRETION NOW IS IS REALLY APPROPRIATE -- AND IT'S WORKING THE OTHER THING IS THAT DO YOU EYES AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SOMEONE WHO COMES TO COURT WHERE THERE'S BEEN NO INJURY IN THE PRIOR DO YOU EYES I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT -- BUT DO YOU AYE IS ONE OF THOSE OFFENSES WERE DISCRETION IS ROOM PROBABLY MOST APPROPRIATE. BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF DRIVE THERE ARE A LOT OF CIRCUMSTANCES. DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES COMES DO YOU AYE UNLIKE OTHER OFFENSES YOU OFTENTIMES ARE DEALING WITH SOMEONE WHO HAS ADDICTION OFTENTIMES IT'S SOMEBODY WHO GETS MULTIPLE DO YOU EYES IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. BECAUSE THEY HAVE AN ADDICTION THEY GET YOUR SEVEN YEARS OF SOBRIETY THEN THE RELAPSE AND THEN THE YET ANOTHER DO YOU WHY -- BUT YOU ALSO HAVE OTHER FOLKS WERE JUST OUT THERE. OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE THERE TO GET TREATMENT. JUDGES HAVE THE DISCRETION NOW DO YOU HAVE THE DISCRETION NOW IN THE EXERCISE OF DISCRETION. REALLY ACTUALLY THE VERY YOU KNOW APPROPRIATELY MOST OF THE TIME NOT ALWAYS BUT MOST OF THE TIME -- AND IT'S THIS KIND OF OFFENSE. WHERE DISCRETION MAKES THE MOST SENSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE SUCH A WIDE VARIETY OF TYPES OF DEFENDANTS SUCH OPEN COURT? SO WE DO UNDERSTAND THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A FELONY THIS CAN BE FOUND TO BE APPROPRIATE AND HAPPENS ALL THE TIME RIGHT NOW. SO THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF THAT THE DISCUSSION BE NEWS SO FOR THOSE REASONS. WERE OPPOSED WE WE DON'T NOT DO I THINK IT SHOULD BE MANDATORY SHOULD REMAIN. THE DIRECTION OF A LOCAL JUST POLICY POLICIES BEING TO INDIVIDUALIZE THE SENTENCE TO LOOK AT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE THE INDIVIDUAL AND IMPOSE A SENSES AS THEY SHOULD APPLY. SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE POSSIBLE. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] BOB. TURNING AS MISTER CHAIR DON CAPCURE MAP OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL MY APOLOGIES FOR THE TARDINESS. THANK YOU. THE MOST COMMON REBEL. THANK YOU MISTER FLORES SO I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I AND FORTUNATELY -- WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL FOR SOME OF THE REASONS THAT WERE STATED THINK UNDER CURRENT LAW NOW -- AFTER THE THIRD SORT OF OFFENSE THE FOURTH CAN BE CONSIDERED A FELONY AND I THINK WITH THAT THERE IS TIME WITH THEM AS P. MANDATED STATE PRISON -- BUT I DO WANT TO GO BACK TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS AROUND THE EMPOWERMENT IN THE SEIZURES OF THE CAR I ACTUALLY WONDER IF THIS IN FACT IS CONSTITUTIONAL. A RECENT SUPREME COURT HEARING TIM'S V. INDIANA. GREES WITH THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT WHICH SAYS YOU CANNOT HAVE EXCESSIVE SEIZURES -- AND THAT APPLIES TO FEDERAL LAW BUT ALSO TO STATES AS WELL -- THERE'S NO SORT OF DISCRETION AROUND. HOW THAT TRANSPORTATION FITS INTO -- YEAH HOW FAMILIES ARE ABLE TO SURVIVE -- AND SO YOU KNOW SEIZING IT DOES THE FAMILY HAVE ONE CAR IS THAT THEIR ONLY MODE OF TRANSPORTATION VERSES MULTIPLE CARS -- BUT MY CONCERN HAS TO BE AROUND EXCESSIVE SEIZURES WE KNOW THAT BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES OFTENTIMES THEY'RE WORKING CLASS AND POOR COMMUNITIES -- AND THIS IMPACT WOULD BE DEVASTATING -- TO BE ABLE TO SURVIVE SO WITH THAT -- I JUST WANTED TO REGISTER MY CONCERNS WITH THAT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THE EXCESSIVE SEIZURE PORTION OF THIS BILL. SO YEAH WE'VE WE'VE LOOKED INTO THAT THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF IT AND ALL OF OUR PEOPLE WE'VE TALKED -- TO IT IS CONSTITUTIONAL BECAUSE PRIOR TO THIS THE SEIZURE OF THE VEHICLE THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH A COURT OF LAW. THIS IS SOMETHING SO THEY WOULD HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT AND ONCE AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WHO'S ON THEIR FIFTY WHY SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY COME INTO THE FIRST ONE AND WE'RE SEIZING IT THIS IS SOMETHING AFTER THE FIFTY WHY. AFTER YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THE JUDICIAL PROCESS THE JUDGE WOULD HAVE DISCRETION AT THAT POINT. SO BECAUSE OF THAT YOU KNOW WE DO BELIEVE. I'M SORRY JUDGE WOULD NOT HAVE DISCRETION THAT POINT START PRIOR TO IN THE CURRENTLY HOW IS THE THE JUDGE WOULD HAVE DISCRETION WITH THIS -- WE WOULD MAKE IT MANDATORY ABSOLUTELY BUT WE DO BELIEVE IT FALLS IN LINE WITH THE CONSTITUTION IS. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE. AS YOU MIGHT GUESS I HAVE A LOT OF EMOTION RELATING TO THIS ISSUE BEING A TWENTY YEAR TWENTY EIGHT YEAR VETERAN THE HIGHWAY PATROL AND I SPENT TWENTY OF THOSE TWENTY EIGHT YEARS WORKING. THE SHIFT WERE DO I FORCE IT WAS THE FOCUS AND I'VE MADE. MANY MANY MANY DEATH NOTIFICATIONS RELATED TO THIS TRAGEDY. THE ARGUMENT AGAINST YOUR BILL HELPS TO BE DISCRETION I'VE. I HAVE TO SHAKE MYHEAD ABOUT THAT I MEAN WHERE'S THE DISCRETION ON NOT ONE NOT TWO NOT THREE NOT EVEN FOR BUT FIVE TIMES. FIVE TIMES YOU HAVE ABUSED YOUR PRIVILEGE TO DRIVE AND YOU THREATEN THE LIVES OF EVERYONE AROUND YOU. THIS IS DISGUSTING. THAT WE TALK ABOUT DISCRETION. A FIVE TIME OFFENDER. I'M TELLING YET. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT WE FOCUS ENTIRELY ON THE INSTRUMENTALITY? ENTIRELY. THIS GETS NO CONSIDERATION ON THE INSTRUMENTALITY WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT. SOMEBODY WHO'S PROVEN PROVE IT. THAT THEY HAVE ABUSED THE PRIVILEGE TO DRIVE AND THREATEN THE LIVES OF ALL THOSE AROUND THEM. AND WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT DISCRETION. I'M TELLING YOU THIS IS. NOT ONLY REASONABLE IT'S GREATLY APPRECIATED BY SOMEONE WHO'S. SEEING THE REALITY OF THIS DISTRICT WHERE PUBLIC. AND I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD. THANK YOU MISTER LACKEY. ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU YOU MAY CLOSE. I'LL AND I'LL JUST KEEP MY MY COMMENTS -- SHORT BUT I WILL SAY YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE HEARD IT -- AS WE LOOKED INTO THIS BILL THIS IS NOT BEEN SOMETHING THAT WAS. QUICKLY THOUGHT OUT I MEAN WE WE PUT A LOT OF TIME AND AFTER GOING THROUGH THE DMV DATA. AND I HEAR THIS A LOT ABOUT YOU KNOW THE LIFELONG HARDSHIPS FOR THESE FOLKS THAT THAT HAVE HAD A FELONY ON THEM AND HOW THAT IS A LIFE CHANGING EVENT FOR THEM. AND I CAN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I AM A TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO TO TO TELL STORY. BECAUSE I SPEND IT SAYS TWO THOUSAND AND ONE ASPECT OR ANOTHER I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE FIRE SERVICE. TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND A WE RESPONDED TO A CALL. ON ESKERS GAY COUPLE PEOPLE ARE INJECTED. COUPLE PEOPLE WERE PENDANT. SO I SHOW UP ON SCENE WITH THE CREW. THERE'S A YOUNG LADY THAT'S HANGING OUT OF THE SUN ROOF THE CAR'S TILTED DOWN ON THE ENGINE COMPARTMENT HANGING HALFWAY UP THE SUN ROOF I CRAWL UNDERNEATH THE BACK OF THE CAR TO KEEP YOUR AIRWAY OPEN. MY CAPTAIN ARRIVES ON SCENE. THERE'S LIKE FLOOR IS THAT MY DAUGHTER. TAKE THE HAIR AWAY FROM HER FACE AND IT WAS HIS DAUGHTER. HIS DAUGHTER WAS DRIVING. AT A PARTY THAT SHE WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE OUT. THE DRUNK DRIVER WAS EJECTED AND NON INJURED SEVEN OVER THERE. I DON'T KNOW HOW THE CAPTAIN DIDN'T GO OVER THERE IS A FATHER OF TWO GIRLS IN THIS HANDLE SOME BUSINESS RIGHT THEN. BECAUSE OF THE EMOTION HE WAS FEELING WAS HUGE. BUT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THAT DAUGHTER WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. SHE'S GOT DRAMATIC BRAIN INJURIES -- THEIR FAMILIES RIPPED APART AND MOM AND DAD ARE DIVORCED NOW BECAUSE OF THIS. SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HARDSHIPS I I WANT TO MAKE IT VERY VERY CLEAR THAT I UNDERSTAND. THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS GOING TO CHANGE SOMEBODY'S LIFE WITH A FELONY. I DO NOT TAKE THAT LIGHTLY BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FIFTH TIME THEY MADE TO SUGGEST DECISION. WHERE IS THAT IN THE DAUGHTER? WHO'S GOT BRAIN INJURIES. THE DAUGHTER WHO'S NOT COMING HOME. THAT IS ALSO A LIFELONG HARDSHIP FOR THOSE FAMILIES THEY TO FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GRAPPLE WITH THIS. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHT. THANK YOU AND I AND AND I UNDERSTAND BOTH YOUR PASSION AND AND MY STEAM COLLEAGUE OF THE BIKES CHAIR. OF I JUST GOT BACK. OF FROM NEW ORLEANS. AND DURING MARDI GRAS TIME. DOWN THE STREET FROM THE HOUSE -- STAYING -- THERE WAS INDIVIDUALS DRUNK. AND RAN INTO A CROWD OF PEOPLE KILLING TWO PEOPLE -- THE AFTER AMERICAN WOMAN THAT WAS KILLED STARTED ONE IN A MARDI GRAS PARADES THERE AND I ACTUALLY PARTICIPATED IN DAY. IN A MEMORIAL THAT DAY THEY HAVE FOR HER AS THEY MARCHED TO NEW ORLEANS. AND I SAW THE GRIEF NOT ONLY OF THE OF THE FAMILY -- BUT I ALSO SAW. THIS YOUNG MAN AFTER AMERICAN MALE. WHO AT A MINUTE HE HAD A DRINKING PROBLEM? AND IT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IS SECOND OR THIRD TIME -- HE WAS DEFINITELY. FROM BE AN ALCOHOLIC BUT THE THE NOW IT WAS A FAMILY BUT REALLY PAYING ME WAS THE FACT THAT HIS FATHER. WAS A MEMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. HIS FATHER WAS A MEMBER OF THE NEW ORLEANS POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND I SAW THE ANGUISH. IN HIS FACE. SO. THIS BILL MISS AFFECTS. BOTH SIDES AND BOTH FAMILIES TO JUST TEARS APART. AND THE FOR FOR ME THIS IS THIS IS. PRIMARY ILLNESS THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY NOT REALLY COME TO GRIPS WITH ON HOW TO DEAL WITH IT -- I'VE VEN HAD THE OCCASION TO GO TO NORTH DAKOTA LOOK AT SOME PROGRAMS THAT WILL. THEY USES ANKLE BRACELET AND THINGS THAT PEOPLE ON THIS SIDE OF THE TABLE WOULD PROBABLY FIGHT ME ON THAT I FOUND COULD BE VERY EFFECTIVE. IN COMBATING THIS AND IN KEEPING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR THEIR CARS OR RESTRAINING HIM FROM DRIVING THOSE THE CARD AND WE GO BACK AND FORTH. ON THAT ALL THE TIME. AND THEN AND ONE WHO'S. GOING FROM THREE STRIKES TO FIVE STRIKES AND AT THE END HOW THAT. IMPACTED. THE DID YOU KNOW JUSTICE IN HOUSING PAINTER OUR JAIL SYSTEM OUT IMPACT AT THE PRISON SYSTEM -- I THINK AND FOR ME MOST OF IT'S BECAUSE WE REAL NOT REALLY NOT HAVE ADDRESSED. HOW WE -- CONTAINED IN A RADIC KATE THIS ILLNESS. AND THAT'S WHY DID THE AUDIT ON REHABILITATION PROGRAMS BECAUSE I WANTED MAY SEE WITH THEIR AFFECTED WE HAVE TO DISCUSSION ABOUT YOU GO THIS PROGRAM THAT PROGRAM THAT PROGRAM WE DON'T TALK ABOUT WE'RE NOT THERE A THEY ARE EFFECTIVE. AND SO I I'M MORE OF HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THESE PROGRAMS THAT BEFORE TO GET THE FIVE THAT THERE ACTUALLY WORKING. I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT UNFORTUNATELY SOMEONE IT GETS TO THE FIFTH TIMER SEVEN TIME IS BECAUSE THIS ILLNESS IS IN THE CITY IS ILLNESS WHERE IT MAY ACTUALLY TAKE THEM SEVEN TIMES. TO GET OVER IT AND THIS INHIBITS THAT. ABILITY FOR JUDGE. TO LOOK AT THAT PERSON AND AND TRY TO MAKE A DETERMINATION. AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS WHY I'M RECOMMENDING A NO VOTE -- AND I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHERS TO COME WHAT WITH BETTER REMEDIES SO THAT WE CAN. TAKE CARE OF THIS ILLNESS AND AND I HOPE THAT WE WE UNDERSTAND IT THERE A LOT OF ILLNESSES IN THIS IN THIS COUNTRY. BUT THIS ONE IS FOR ME IS WHEN THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE A SELF INFLICTED. WE MAKE THAT DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DRINK THEM. ONCE WE GO DOWN THAT ROAD OR ANY VEHICLES ON A ROAD IT'S JUST IT DOESN'T STOP.

THANK YOU -- MEANT SECTOR CALL THE ROLL ON EIGHTY FOUR ONE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY. LACKEY AYE BARRICADE HAN. BAUER-KAHAN NOT VOTING DEEP. I DEEP I KAMLAGER-DOVE HAVE NO KAMLAGER-DOVE NO QUIRK NO. QUIRK KNOWS SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO NO WICKS NO. I'M SORRY THE MEASURE FAILS. THANK YOU AGAIN THANK YOU. THANK THE WITNESSES WE NOW HAVE MR BONTA -- AB. ONE THREE FIVE ITEM NUMBER. TWO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ON ASSEMBLY BILL ONE THIRTY FIVE TODAY. THIS BILL IS A REINTRODUCTION OF ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT THIS COMMITTEE APPROVED ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS. THIS IMPORTANT BILL WILL CLOSE A LOOPHOLE THAT HAS EMERGED WITH THE GROWING USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA BY HUMAN TRAFFICKING RINGS. ACCORDING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE ISN'T THERE IS AN ALARMING TREND OF HUMAN TRAFFICKERS USING THE INTERNET AND POPULAR SOCIAL MEDIA SITES SUCH AS FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM TO LEARN POTENTIAL VICTIMS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN A LAW ENFORCEMENT TASK FORCE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SET UP A DE QUOI ACCOUNT. TO SOLICIT HUMAN TRAFFICKING AS PART OF A STING OPERATION. THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WERE TAKEN ABACK BY HOW MUCH TRAFFIC IN INTERESTS WERE GENERATED BY THESE ACCOUNTS. THESE ATTEMPTS TO TRAFFIC USING SOCIAL MEDIA AND A REAL HAVE A REAL IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF OUR CHILDREN. A QUICK THINKING TICKET AGENT WAS SUCCESSFULLY HAD SUCCESSFULLY STOP TWO TEENAGE GIRLS FROM BOARDING A FLIGHT OUT SACRAMENTO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE TWO TEENAGERS WERE ATTEMPTING TO FLY TO GET THEM. VIA INSTAGRAM PROMISING THEM MODELING OPPORTUNITIES LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TRAFFIC ID. HAD THEY NOT INTERVENED. THIS BILL IS NECESSARY BECAUSE EXISTING LAW ONLY PENALIZES HUMAN TRAFFICKERS WHO ACTUALLY INDUCE OR PERSUADE A MINOR TO ENGAGE IN A COMMERCIAL SEX ACT. THERE ARE NO PENALTIES FOR THE MIDDLE MAN IN THAT CHAIN THE INDIVIDUALS WHO CONTACT THE MINERS OVER SOCIAL MEDIA. PUT THEM IN -- IN A SITUATION WHERE THERE ARE AT RISK OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. IN SACRAMENTO AIRPORT EXAMPLE THE INDIVIDUALS WHO CONTACTED THE TWO TEENS MAY NOT HAVE BEEN HELD CRIMINALLY LIABLE. THEIR INVOLVEMENT SPECIFICALLY ARRANGING THE FLIGHT TO NEW YORK CITY MAY HAVE BEEN ATTENUATED FROM THE INDUCEMENT OF COMMITTING A COMMERCIAL SEX ACT AS REQUIRED BY CURRENT LAW. THIS BILL WILL CLOSE THIS DANGEROUS LOOPHOLE AND PROTECT OUR CHILDREN BY MAKING IT A FELONY TO CONTACT A MINOR WITH THE INTENT TO ENGAGE IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING. WITH ME TODAY O TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. IS ALAMEDA COUNTY DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY DAN REISMAN. GOOD MORNING CHAIR GOOD MORNING. MEMBERS ASSEMBLY -- EXCUSE ME I AM A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY WHO IS A SPONSOR. AND HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. I AM IN MY ELEVENTH YEAR AS A DEPUTY DA AND AND MY THIRD YEAR -- CLOSING UP MY THIRD YEAR ON THE HUMAN EXPLOITATION AND TRAFFICKING UNIT WITH THE DA'S OFFICE -- AND I I HANDLE ONLY CASES THAT ARE BEING COMMITTED AGAINST -- AGAINST. GIRLS AND YOUNG WOMEN WHO ARE BEING PROSTITUTED BY PEOPLE TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM I TALKED TO THESE WOMEN EVERY DAY I READ THESE PIMPS -- THE THE TEXT MESSAGES ON THE PHONE AND POSTINGS OF THESE BANDS EVERY DAY -- AND I WHAT WHAT I SEE IN MY WORK IN A AND FORGIVE MY MY USE OF THE OF THE GENDERED PRONOUNS WHEN I DO BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY MY CASES IT IS A MALE PERPETRATOR AND A FEMALE VICTIM -- THE THE THE PIMPS CAST A VERY WIDE NET. AND THERE THERE'S A LOT OF MENTION IN. IN THEIR IN THEIR COMMUNICATIONS OF HEY GIRL AND HEY IT'S ME FROM WHATEVER -- SOCIAL MEDIA SAYING THEY FIRST MADE THE CONNECTION. AND SOMETIMES THEY GET A RESPONSE AND SOMETIMES THEY DON'T -- AND THE WE SHOULD WHEN THOSE WHEN WHEN THOSE MEN ARE REACHING OUT WITH THE INTENT TO EXPLOIT A VULNERABLE YOUNG WOMAN. OF ALL THE REAL GIRL -- BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING OUT. FOR WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY CATCH THE ONE WHO IS SO VULNERABLE AND IT'S SUCH A HARD PLACE IN HER LIFE THAT SHE'S WILLING. TO BITE ON THAT HOOK THAT HE SET FOR HER -- WHAT THIS CRIME DOES IT CLEARLY INDICATES THAT? THAT. THE COMMUNICATION ITSELF WITH EFFICIENT IT'S NOT -- UNDER CURRENT LAW. A WHAT WHAT IN THE JURY INSTRUCTION IS CALLED AN IMMEDIATE STEP THAT PUTS THE PLAN IN MOTION SO THAT THE PLAN WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETED IF SOME CIRCUMSTANCE OUTSIDE THE PLAN. HAD NOT INTERRUPTED THE ATTEMPT. WE DON'T NEED TO ASK THE QUESTION THE JURORS DON'T NEED TO ASK THE QUESTION OF IS THIS. AN IMMEDIATE STEP. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE. ENDED IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING OF THIS GIRL HAD THERE NOT BEEN AN OUTSIDE INFLUENCE. WHEN THE PIMP REACHES OUT AND IS IS SETTING THAT HOOK AND TRYING TO GET HER TO BUY? IF SHE DOESN'T BITE HE'S STILL. COMMITTED A GRAVE OFFENSE AGAINST OUR SOCIETY HE SHOULD BE PUNISHED. FOR TAKING THAT ACTION. EVEN IF A JURY WOULD NOT FIND THAT IT'S THE IMMEDIATE STEP THAT WOULD QUALIFY AS AN ATTEMPT. AND IT REMOVES THE AMBIGUITY CURRENTLY UNDER THE LAW -- SO THAT PEOPLE ARE PUNISHED UNIFORMLY FOR THE ACTS OF THEY COMMIT. THANK YOU. ARE ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. NAME AN ORGANIZATION. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. BRENDAN UP ON BEHALF OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS WORK. THàNH CAP KEY CRIME VICTIMS UNITED CALIFORNIANS PART. JONATHON FELDMAN CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING MISSING CHAIR MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUCH LOWER AND YOU HAVE TO CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. SURE RYAN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION MARCO GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION -- WITH GOES WITHOUT QUESTION THAT WERE OPPOSED TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING. BUT WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. AND THIS BILL WAS VETOED LAST YEAR BY GOVERNOR BROWN. AND AS HE SAID IT'S IT'S WELL IN THIS BILL IS NOT NECESSARY AMERICA OF STATUTES PROVIDE PUNISHMENT FOR COMMERCIAL SEX ACTS AS WELL AS USING. PAYING OR EMPLOYING MINORS TO COMMIT COMMERCIAL SEX ACTS -- AS A FORMER ALAMEDA COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS -- I WOULD SUBMIT THAT -- THE JUST THE SCENARIO THAT -- THE DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY DESCRIBED IS IN FACT AN ATTEMPT. AND THAT IS ALREADY COVERED IN THE LAW -- SECTION TWO THIRTY SIX POINT ONE MAKES IT A FELONY PUNISHABLE BY FIVE TO FIFTEEN YEARS IN PRISON. TO CAUSE A DEUCE OR PERSUASION OR ATTEMPT TO CAUSE INDUCED OR PERSUADED A MINOR TO ENGAGE IN A COMMERCIAL SEX SEX ACT OR ANY OF OF THEIR ENUMERATED LIST. WHAT THIS ON BILL WOULD DO HOWEVER THE -- UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IS THAT IT WOULD CRIMINALIZE THE BEHAVIOR OF THE VICTIMS AND POTENTIAL VICTIMS. OF FOR EXAMPLE IF -- TWO SISTERS AND AN ABUSED SETTING ON THEIR FAMILIES DYSFUNCTIONAL THEY START TALKING ABOUT WE'RE GOING TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME. WELL HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET BY WELL I GUESS WE'RE GONNA ON WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK AS ON PROSTITUTES. THE THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN THEM. THIS IS THE AMBIT OF THIS BILL IS SO BROAD IT WOULD BE COVERED. IF THEY THEN -- TALK TO A BOYFRIEND WHO MIGHT SAY WELL I'LL HELP YOU GET AWAY THEN HE ALSO HIS BEHAVIOR WOULD BE CRIMINALIZED -- ANOTHER SITUATION WOULD BE SOMEBODY WHO WAS FRESH ON THE STREETS. AND SHE RUNS INTO ANOTHER. YOUNG PERSON MALE OR FEMALE WHO SENT THE HOMELESS SHELTER. AND THEY WERE DISCUSSING THE LIFE ON AND THE THE MINOR SAYS I'M WORKING FOR JOAN MAYBE SHE COULD HELP YOU OUT. TO THAT ACT WOULD BE CRIMINALIZED THIS IS TOO BROAD. THE EXISTING LAW TWO THIRTY SIX POINT ONE D. CAREFULLY CRUMB AVOIDS CRIMINALIZING THESE MINERS BUT TAKING. IN. THE STATUTE THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES BETWEEN THE VICTIM AND THE TRAFFIC OR SO. WE WOULD. ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT VIOLATING PENAL CODE SECTION TWO EIGHTY EIGHT POINT. THREE BY CONTACTING A MINOR -- DUPLICATES WHAT TWO THIRTY SIX POINT ONE ALREADY PROHIBITS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. YES. I'M GOOD MORNING CATHY SURE ABOUT HALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA -- I'VE JUST -- JOINT IN THE COMMENTS OF MISS GEORGE -- WE ALSO OPPOSE AB ONE THIRTY FIVE BECAUSE IT IS UNNECESSARY -- THE EXAMPLE WAS GIVEN A OF A TRAFFIC OR WHO TAKES A STEP OF CONTACTING A YOUNG PERSON BUT THEN THERE'S NO RESPONSE -- IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING -- ALREADY PUNISHABLE UNDER EXISTING LAW -- POTENTIALLY AS HUMAN TRAFFICKING OR POTENTIALLY AS AND AS ATTEMPTED HUMAN TRAFFICKING. HELP WE REALLY DON'T NEED TO FURTHER COMPLICATE OUR CRIMINAL LAWS BY CREATING A NEW CRIME. THAT ADDRESSES BEHAVIOR THAT IS ALREADY CRIMINAL UNDER EXISTING LAW -- AB ONE THIRTY FIVE DOES EXACTLY THIS WILL IN NO WAY HELPING TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. WE ASK FOR YOUR NOSE THANK YOU. OF ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR QUIRK. YEAH AS I TOLD THE AUTHOR I DON'T THINK I CAN VOTE FOR THIS BILL FOR THE REASONS GIVEN BY THE ACLU. AND THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S I'LL BE VOTING NO TODAY BUT I DO RESPECT. THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING BUT BOTH ARE ANALYSIS FROM THE STAFF HERE. AND WHAT WE'VE HEARD IN TESTIMONY SAY THAT THIS IS ALREADY A CRIME. AND I'M SORT OF LOOKING AT THIS NOW DIFFERENTLY THAN I DID HAVING SEEN THE GOVERNOR'S VETO AND I THINK HE HAD A GOOD REASON TO VETO IT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER. COMMENTS SHOULD. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS AROUND IS I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL IN PART IT'S BECAUSE MY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES ARE TELLING ME ALL THE TIME THAT WE HAVE A PROBLEM HERE AND THEY'RE LOSING. WE HAVE VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING AND WE CANNOT DO ENOUGH TO STOP IT AND WE NEED MORE TOOLS TO DO SO AND SO I THINK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT ADDITIONAL TOOL. BUT I DO HEAR THE CONCERNS -- OF THE POTENTIAL OF THIS BILL -- TO CRIMINALIZE OTHER VICTIMS I HOPE YOU'LL TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AND MAKING AMENDMENTS THAT THOSE PEOPLE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THIS LAW. YES MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE WAKE [inaudible] GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MY NAME IS JANICE BALLOU GM FROM SACRAMENTO AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS SHERRY SACRAMENTO AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL. MIKE VIRGINIA FROM ELK GROVE OPPOSE THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. FRANKLIN OR CNET RIVERSIDE COUNTY I OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU THEIR MIND SACRAMENTO I OPPOSE THIS BILL. DR -- IN THE H. RETIRED COLLEGES CDC ARE AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL. ROGER ANY GOOD BUSINESSMAN FROM MODESTO OPPOSE THIS BILL AS DUPLICATE [inaudible] YOU. CHARLES LOPEZ OUT GROW BY OPPOSE. IN A TO REGAIN A CEMETERY COUNTY AN EDUCATOR I OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. I GUESS I NEED A COUNT OF FIVE BEFORE I GO. TO NEXT. OF THIS COME LOADED OF THANK YOU SO I WANT TO THANK YOU -- FOR BRINGING THIS BILL BEFORE US I AND GOING TO RELUCTANTLY SUPPORT THIS BILL I HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH IT I THINK EXACERBATED BY THE COMMENTS ARE PROVIDED BY -- THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE IT IS DUPLICATIVE. I FEEL LIKE WE ARE FIND TRYING TO JIGSAW LAWS ON TOP OF EACH OTHER TO SQUEEZE OUT. ANY KIND OF LIGHT POSSIBLE SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE DOWN THE ROAD OF MASS INCARCERATION. IN THE GOAL IS NOT TO CREATE A NANNY STATE WHERE NO ONE HAS THE ABILITY TO WALK OR LIVE FREE LEE THE GOAL IS ACTUALLY TO SET PARAMETERS SO PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT WITHOUT BEING AFRAID OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WITHOUT BEING AFRAID OF PROSECUTORS WITHOUT BEING AFRAID. OF THE D. A.. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY MOVING DOWN THAT ROAD WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS I THINK THIS IS DUPLICATIVE I THINK IT IS OVER BURDENSOME I THINK IT COMPLICATES THINGS DRASTICALLY AND IT ALLOWS FOR FOLKS -- WHO ARE PROSECUTING TO FIND MORE AND MORE WAYS TO PUT? VICTIMS IN JAIL BUT ALSO JUST PUT PEOPLE WHO THEY DON'T LIKE OR DON'T UNDERSTAND INTO JAIL. FURTHER EXACERBATED MY CONCERNS BY SOME OF YOUR COMMENTS ARE SPECIALLY JURORS NOT NEEDING TO ASK THE QUESTION WHEN I HEAR THINGS LIKE THAT. THAT TRANSLATES TO ME THE ERASURE OF DUE PROCESS -- AND IF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE PUNISHED UNIFORMLY FOR THE CRIMES THEY COMMIT. THE REALITY IS IN THIS COUNTRY. FOLKS ARE PROSECUTED. BASED ON THE REPRESENTATION THAT THEY'RE ABLE TO AFFORD IN SO WE HAVE TO GET TO A POINT WHERE THE BIAS AND THE PRIVILEGE IS TAKEN OUT OF THE REPRESENTATION THAT YOU'RE AFFORDED SO I HOPE THAT IN THIS PROCESS. THE AMENDMENTS ARE TAKEN AND THAT THESE KINDS OF CONCERNS ARE REALLY LISTEN TO BECAUSE WE'RE CREATING A SITUATION WHERE. THE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE INCARCERATED THIS IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE COMPLEXION OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE ARRESTED AND PUNISHED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YES THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS TODAY UP I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL AS WELL BUT I JUST WANT TO ADD ON IN SUPPORT OF BOTH REBEKAH BAUER-KAHAN AND AND I'M CITIES COMMENTS AS MY MY ESTEEMED COLLEAGUES OF THE TO SOME WOMAN ON THE OTHER SIDE -- AND HOPE THAT YOU TAKE -- THEIR COMMENTS INTO CONSIDERATION DURING -- THE AMENDMENTS PROCESS. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENT. THANK YOU MISTER MISTER MEN -- I WANT TO COMMEND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES FOR OF BRINGING THIS BILL -- BACK -- INTO THE SESSIONS AYE AYE KNOWS. OF THE GOVERNOR DEAN SUPPORTED OF THIS IDEAL LAST TIME BUT WE HAVE A NEW GOVERNOR AND I WOULD ASK FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CO SPONSOR. OF HER BILL -- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CLOSE AND OF THOSE THAT. WOULD TO A PERPETRATE OR ATTEMPT. TO EXPLOIT OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR SOCIETY -- AND SO IF IF YOU BE OPEN TO THAT I I WOULD I WOULD BE A WE HONOR. TO SUPPORT HER BILL AND ALSO MISTER CHAIRMAN I WANT TO ASK -- OUR TWO WITNESSES -- FROM THE ACLU IN. THE THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE -- SMILEY SO ONLY MY SECOND HEARING BUT WOULD. WOULD YOU GUYS EVER SUPPORT A TOUGH ON CRIME BILL OR IS IT LIKE A LIKE AN AUTOMATICALLY WHAT DID YOU. STAY SPECIFICALLY TO THE MERITS OF THIS BILL. FOR ARTS I MAYBE THAT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION MISTER IT IS. DID YOU EVER COME YEAH JUST REAL QUICKLY I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING THE VICTIM ORIENTED BILL. IT IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED AND THIS IS A VERY HEINOUS CRIME. THAN IMPACTS VICTIMS FOR A LIFETIME SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN AND YOUR REMEDY THERE I THINK IT'S VERY REASONABLE APPRECIATED THANK YOU. IT WAS THAT A SECOND MISTER YES [inaudible] OKAY. YES. YOU MAY CLOSE AFTER IT OR ANY OTHER. OKAY YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHILE I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE. THE COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUES IN. OUR REMARKS I DO WANT TO JUST HIGHLIGHT AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE CASE AS WAS MENTIONED. ARE WITH THE SACRAMENTO CASE AT THE AIRPORT IT IS UNCLEAR AT BEST WHETHER THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO CONTACTED THESE TWO TEENS INVITING THEM TO NEW YORK PURCHASING THEIR PLANE TICKETS WOULD ACTUALLY BE PROSECUTED UNDER EXISTING LAW. AND I CERTAINLY WANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE TACKLING THIS ISSUE AT ALL FRIENDS -- BOAT WAITED. LIKE TO WORK WITH OTHERS WHO ALSO WANT TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND WOULD ENCOURAGE A DIALOGUE OUR STATE UNFORTUNATELY IS THE HUB OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN THIS COUNTRY AND THE STATUS QUO TO ME IS AN ACCEPTABLE. AND THIS IS WHY I BRING FOR THIS BILL AGAIN THIS SESSION I BELIEVE THERE'S MUCH MORE TO BE DONE. WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THNK YOU -- IT SURE IS GONNA RECOMMEND I BUT I I WOULD. CAUTION YOU THAT IF IT GETS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. THAT YOU TAKE THE COMMENTS FROM THE OPPOSITION VERY SERIOUSLY. YOU TAKE THE COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE VERY SERIOUSLY. BECAUSE IF IT GETS OUT YOU DON'T WANNA LOSE BOTH AS YOU MOVE FORWARD AS WE TRY TO GET TO THE FLOOR -- THE CALM AS THEY MADE ABOUT ENSURING THAT WE DON'T OR PROSECUTOR WE JUST DOESN'T TAKE US DOWN A RABBIT HOLE OR VERY ABOUT. AND WHAT THEY PUT THE PRODUCT AND SO WORK THROUGH THAT PROCESS I WOULD BE VERY VERY. VERY HELPFUL -- AS YOU PROCEED ONWARD -- BECAUSE THAT WILL BE BROUGHT UP HI I GUARANTEE YOU WILL BE BROUGHT UP AGAIN. AND AGAIN AGAIN AND MEMBERS OUTSIDE THIS. THIS COMMITTEE ARE VERY SENSITIVE TO THAT AND SO -- HOW YOU WERE SUCCESSFUL BEFORE?

WITH ME TODAY PROVIDE TESTIMONY BRIAN MORTGAGEE PRESIDENT OF THE LA COUNTY PROFESSIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION AND DAVID TEMPERAMENT A SOCIAL WORKER AND MEMBER OF ASKED ME. THANK YOU GERMAN YOUR FIVE MINUTES ARE YOU SPLIT UP. IT'S BASED ON OF A QUICK BRIAN. GOOD MORNING. I REPRESENT THE LA COUNTY PROFESSIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION AND WE REPRESENT ABOUT NINE THOUSAND LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS IN LAS SANDERS. PRIMARY FROM PRIMARILY FROM THE LA COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. THE LA COUNTY JAIL SYSTEM HOUSES OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND INMATES AND THE INCIDENCE OF GASSING IS INCREASING EVERY YEAR IT'S MORE THAN DOUBLED SINCE. TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THE PRIMARY TYPE OF GAS IN OUR JAILS OF IN YOUR AND AND EMPLOYEES. THE INMATES MIX THE URINE AND FECES AND A COP THEN THEY ADD TO THE BASE TO IT SO THAT'LL STICK TO THE SKIN. OF THE EMPLOYEE THE TARGET THE FACE SO THAT IT'LL GET IN THEIR EYES. A NOSE AND MOUTH. IT IS INTENDED TO INFECT THE EMPLOYEES WITH DISEASES THE INMATES MAY HAVE INCLUDING HEPATITIS AND H. I. V.. WE AVERAGE OVER TO ORDER CASES OF GASSING EACH YEAR TRUST IN THE LA COUNTY JAIL OF WHICH AROUND FORTY ARE CONFIRMED TO HAVE COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. WE HAVE TO PROTECT THE EMPLOYEES WHO WORK IN SUCH VIOLENT SETTINGS. CURRENTLY THEY HAVE NO PROTECTIVE GEAR AGAINST THESE ASSAULTS FIREFIGHTERS HAVE PROTECTIVE -- JACKETS DOCTORS WEAR PROTECTIVE GLOVES -- BUT CUSTODIAL OFFICERS HAVE NO PROTECTION AT ALL FROM GASSING. MOST EMPLOYEES HAVE NO IDEA OF THEIR RIGHTS OR WHAT TO DO AFTER GASSING ATTACK. THEY FEEL LIKE THEY ARE ALONE AND HAVE NO SUPPORT THEY SUFFER FROM STRESS AND SLEEPLESS NIGHTS NOT KNOWING IF THEY HAVE CONTRACTED THE DISEASE. AS IF HAVING FECES AND URINE THROWN IN YOUR FACE ISN'T BAD ENOUGH THESE EMPLOYEES FEEL AS THOUGH NOBODY CARES ABOUT THEM. WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM ASSEMBLY BILL TWO NINETY FOUR IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS RECOGNIZING THE PROBLEM OF GASSING AND DEVELOPING PROTECTIONS AND RIGHTS FOR THE CUSTODIAL OFFICERS WERE SUBJECT TO THESE HORRIBLE ATTACKS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. MY NAME IS. MY NAME IS DAVID TEPPERMAN. I'M A SOCIAL WORKER AT CORCORAN STATE PRISON IN THE MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. AND A MEMBER OF ASKS ME LOCAL TWENTY SIX TWENTY I SUPPORT AB. FOR STAFF. TO SAFELY MITIGATE EXPOSURE TO HUMAN EXCREMENT AND OTHER POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS BODILY FLUIDS INCLUDING SALIVA AND SOMETIMES SEMEN [inaudible] HELLO. AND QUIRK GRIN WE HAVE THREE TO FIVE GAS SINGS PER WEEK SACRAMENTO ALSO HAS A LOT OF THE PRISON SACRAMENTO ALSO HAS A LOT OF GAS THINGS. EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF FLUIDS ALLOWS FOR PROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT OF THE STAFF. TREATMENT IS EXTENSIVE FOR SOME OF THESE DISEASES. LOTS OF BAD SIDE EFFECTS -- MANY PEOPLE. WHO GET GAST HAVE TO REFRAIN FROM? UNPROTECTED SEXUAL ACTIVITY FOR UP TO A YEAR. THIS REALLY IMPACTS OF FAMILY -- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ASK YOU TO AMEND SECTION TWO TO REPLACE CLOTHING NOT JUST OF CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS BUT I'M ALL STAFF WE WORK SIDE BY SIDE WITH CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS. ARE EXPOSURE IS THE SAME -- AND IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE FOR US. I'VE PERSONALLY BEEN GASSED IT'S VERY UNPLEASANT. I WAS MORE LUCKY THAN MOST. AND THAT THE FLUID ONLY HAD MY ARM AND I DIDN'T HAVE ANY BREAKS IN THE SKIN. OUR OTHER OF MY COLLEAGUES. HAVE HAD TO HAVE A EXTENSIVE TREATMENT. FOR UP TO A YEAR. THE EARLY IDENTIFICATION IS REALLY IMPORTANT. TO BE ABLE TO AT LEAST KNOW. HAVE A BETTER IDEA. OF YOUR LEVEL OF EXPOSURE PLEASE SUPPORT THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. ELEVEN JOHN LEVEL ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. CALIFORNIA COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISORS ORGANIZATION AND CALIFORNIA NARCOTICS OFFICERS ASSOCIATION ALL IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU I DO IT -- SIX MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MATTHEW CYBER THAT WE HAVE THE ASSOCIATION FOR LOS ANGELES DEPUTY SHERIFFS IN THE LOS ANGELES PROBATION OFFICERS UNION ASK ME THAT WAS. SIX EIGHTY FIVE BOTH IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS CRITICAL -- RANK AND FILE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. ONE WAS CHAIR MEMBERS JIM ON BAKER ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION STRONG SUPPORT [inaudible] THANK YOU. A BRANDED UP ON BEHALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. RANGER WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. COULD YOU ALLOW. THE TO SEE. FORTY GOOD MORNING TEAR THE NUMBERS. FISHER ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA -- LET ME JUST START BY SAYING THAT -- WE HAVE NO ISSUE WITH THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS BILL WHICH I UNDERSTAND TO BE -- INFORMING OFFICERS OF THEIR RIGHTS UNDER EXISTING LAW AND MAKING SURE THEY GET WHAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO AND AND FURTHER PROTECTIVE GEAR -- NONE OF THAT IS A NEW THING THAT WE HAVE ANY CONCERN WITH -- I ALSO WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER STAFF FOR TALKING TO US AND WORKING WITH US ON OUR CONCERNS. UNFORTUNATELY THE CURRENT AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL -- DO NOT RESOLVE THOSE CONCERNS AND WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB. TWO NINETY FOUR THE PROPOSED CHANGES REGARDING WHEN SOMEBODY IN CUSTODY CAN BE INVOLUNTARILY TESTED FOR DISEASE ARE AT BEST CONFUSING AND UNNECESSARY AND AT WORST COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN THE FAILURE TO PROVIDE. IMPORTANT PART IMPORTANT DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS BEFORE A PERSON IS SUBJECTED TO INVOLUNTARY TESTING -- LET ME STEP BACK FOR A MINUTE AND TALK ABOUT WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE FOR SEIZURES -- AS TO WHEN INVOLUNTARY TESTING CAN BE IMPOSED. A PERSON'S RIGHT TO DECIDE WHETHER THAT PERSON WILL BE TESTED FOR HIV OR ANY OTHER DISEASE IS AN ESSENTIAL CIVIL RIGHT AND NO ONE SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO INVOLUNTARY TESTING. WITHOUT PROTECTIONS TO ENSURE THAT THE TESTING IS TRULY NECESSARY. IN A CORRECTIONAL SETTING THE CONCERNS ARE SURROUNDING INVOLUNTARY TESTING ARE HEIGHTENED. AN INMATE MAY HAVE VERY GOOD REASON TO REFUSE TESTING AS THE IN MAY MAY BE SUBJECT TO STIGMA AND INDEED IN PHYSICAL HARM. SIMPLY ON THE BASIS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN TESTED. EXISTING LAW BALANCES THESE IMPORTANT CONCERNS WITH THE RIGHTS OF CORRECTIONAL EMPLOYEES TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY NEED MAY BE AT RISK OF DISEASE FROM A GAS ATTACK OR OTHER CONTACT WITH AN INMATE'S BODILY FLUIDS. TITLE EIGHT OF PART THREE OF THE PENAL CODE BEGINNING WITH SECTION SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED REQUIRES REPORTING OF ANY INCIDENT IN WHICH AN OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE COMES INTO CONTACT WITH AN INMATE'S BODILY FLUIDS. ALLOWS THE OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE TO REQUEST TESTING OF THE IN MADE FOR HIV OR HEPATITIS B. OR C.. AND SETS OUT THE PROCEDURES AND STANDARDS BY WHICH THE DECISION WHETHER OR NOT TO ORDER TESTING MUST BE MADE. THE CHANGES PROPOSED IN AB TWO NINETY FOUR WITH REGARD TO TESTING AND REQUESTS FOR TESTING ARE SIMPLY NOT NECESSARY. AS THE OFFICERS ALREADY HAVE THE RIGHT TO TESTING UNDER EXISTING LAW. AND THEY WILL CREATE CONFUSION ABOUT WHETHER AND HOW THE EXISTING PROVISIONS OF LAW REGARDING TESTING APPLY TO THE THE REQUEST THAT SEEM TO BE NEWLY AUTHORIZED UNDER. THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL. WE WOULD ASK THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED TO REMOVE THE LANGUAGE OF SECTION TWO FORTY THREE POINT NINE C. THREE WHICH THAT'S WHAT WHICH STATES THE OFFICERS RIGHT TO REQUEST TESTING AS WE BELIEVE THAT IS DUPLICATIVE OF EXISTING LAW. TO RESTORE THE EXISTING LANGUAGE OF SECTION TWO FORTY THREE POINT NINE C. TOO SO THAT IT CONTINUES TO REFER TO HEPATITIS AND TUBERCULOSIS WITHOUT HIV BECAUSE HIV TESTING IS COVERED UNDER SECTION SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED AND FALLING -- AND FINALLY SAID THAT THE NEW NOTICES REQUIRED BY THE BILL ACCURATELY DIVERSE DESCRIBE IN EMPLOYEES RIGHT TO REQUEST TESTING. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON THE BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MARGOT GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WANNA THANK THE OFFER FOR THE AMENDMENTS AND WE'RE WITHDRAWING OUR OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR QUIRK. WHAT AT FIRST OF ALL I AM VOTING FOR THE BELL BUT I DO WANT TO KNOW? WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THE PROCEDURE. AND WHY DO YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IT. SO I I WILL SAY THAT I THINK THAT EVEN EXISTING LAW IS SOMEWHAT CONFUSING BECAUSE THERE IS A SECTION TWO FORTY THREE POINT NINE WHICH THE BILL AMENDS WHICH MAKES PROVISION FOR TAX FOR INVOLUNTARY TESTING. WHEN SOMEONE IS THE VICTIM OF A GASSING ATTACK WITH TESTING FOR HEPATITIS OR TUBERCULOSIS AND SETS OUT WHAT THE PROCEDURES ARE -- FOR FOR MAKING THAT DECISION AND AN IMPOSING THAT TESTING AND THEN THERE'S THE SEPARATE FOR IT AND THERE'S THE STATEMENT IN THAT PROVISION THAT SAYS. NOTHING IN THIS SUBDIVISION SHALL BE CONSTRUED THE THE OPERATION OF TITLE EIGHT COMMENCING WITH SECTION. SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED I AM UNCERTAIN FRANKLY HOW THOSE TWO PROVISIONS OF LAW OPERATE NOW BUT I THINK ADDING TO THAT. HIV TESTING UNDER TO FORTY THREE POINT. NINE CREATES FURTHER CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED SPECIFICALLY IN THE CASE OF HIV TESTING AND THEN ADDING THE THE STATEMENT OF THAT THE OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUEST THE IN MAY BE TESTED -- IT IT LEAVES IT UNCLEAR AS TO WHETHER THAT RIGHT TO REQUEST TESTING IS SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF THE EXISTING PROVISIONS -- REGARDING PROCEDURES FOR SUCH A REQUEST OKAY SO I STRONGLY SUPPORT YOUR BILL MISTER RODRIGUEZ. JUDGES CAN DO STRANGE THINGS. SO IT'S PROBABLY BEST YOU WORK WITH YOUR TECHNICAL EXPERTS BECAUSE IF AREN'T THE ACLU SEES THAT THERE'S SOME AMBIGUITY A JUDGE MIGHT SEE IT. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED IF YOU GAS SOMEBODY YOU LOSE YOUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY I DON'T KNOW THAT THE ACLU WOULD SUPPORT ME ON THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S VERY SIMPLE. THERE MAY BE REASONS YOU CAN'T PUT IT THAT WAY BECAUSE OF SOMETHING OR OTHER IN OUR CONSTITUTION BUT IT PROBABLY HELPS TO SIMPLIFY. ARE IN SOME WAY AND AS YOU GO ON FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT BELL I JUST URGE YOU TO LOOK AT THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. QUESTIONS MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE SO I TO WILL BE SUPPORTING -- THE BILL I JUST HOPE THAT -- IN THE PROCESS OF HOPEFULLY THIS AND MAYBE NOT OTHER BILLS MOVING FORWARD THAT THERE'S ALSO SOME CONSIDERATION GIVEN AROUND WHAT HAPPENS AFTER TESTING HAPPENS BECAUSE I WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE CONCERNS OF FOLKS ARE TESTED FOR HIV OR SOME OTHER -- DISEASE AND THEN THERE'S RETALIATES THERE'S FURTHER DISCRIMINATION OR STIGMATISATION AS IT RELATES TO YOU KNOW SOME OF THE THINGS THAT MIGHT BE REVEALED FROM THE TESTING. IF THEY'RE ALREADY VOLATILE UNSTABLE. FACILITIES AND EXACERBATING THAT WITH SOME ADDITIONAL. DRAMA BECAUSE OF SOME RESULTS OF A TEST -- YOU KNOW COULD KIND OF XCELERATED EXACERBATE AN ALREADY UNSTABLE -- SITUATION SO WHY WOULD HER HOPE THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME THOUGHT GIVEN TO KIND OF THE AFTERMATH OF TESTING BECAUSE YOU'RE CERTAINLY TRYING TO PREVENT. GAS THINGS FROM HAPPENING BUT YOU KNOW. SQUARELY THINGS HAPPEN IN THOSE FACILITIES ONCE FOLKS HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THE FEMALE LOOK AT AS WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR I THINK ONE OF THE WITNESSES HAS -- CAN PERHAPS ELUCIDATE WHAT THE CURRENT PROCEDURES ARE. I MEAN. FIRST OF ALL THE INVADERS PROTECT FIRST OF ALL THE INMATE IS PROTECTED BY. THE RULES OF HIP. SO IF THEY DO GET TESTED IT BECOMES PART OF THEIR MEDICAL RECORD. AND HIS. HELD CONFIDENTIAL. WITHIN -- I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT RELATES TO LEADING THE VICTIM NO. BUT IT CERTAINLY -- IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T DOESN'T. PUT THE VICTIMS AND HEALTH RECORD. OUT IN THE GENERAL POPULATION OF THE INMATES IT DOESN'T. I DON'T SEE THAT AS BEING AN ADDED IMPAIRMENT TO THE IN MAY -- IT'S GENERALLY HELD CONFIDENTIALLY AND RETALIATION. BY THE INMATE POPULATION IS NOT AN ISSUE. RETALIATION BY. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS SOMETHING THAT WE TRAIN AGAINST ALL THE TIME. AND WOULD DO VERY WELL WITH THAT IN CORCORAN STATE PRISON. AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT IT'S NOT AN ISSUE [inaudible] YES. ANY OTHER. COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE MISTER RODRIGUEZ RESPECT RAIL FROM ABOUT THANK YOU THANK YOU -- AND DIED THE TWO CHAIRS RECOMMENDING ESPECIALLY AFTER TODAY -- AFTER THE THE DESCRIPTION OF GASSING TODAY. WHICH I CAN'T ON HERE RIGHT NOW -- FOR EVER BE ABLE TO ON HERE -- I I KNOW HOW SERIOUS. THIS IS -- ALSO THE THE DISCUSSION WHICH I THOUGHT WOULD BE. PART OF THE LABOR NEGOTIATION THAT IF. YOU'RE YOU'RE ABLE TO GET A NEW UNIFORM THAT SEEM TO BE KIND OF BASIC TO ME SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING YOU DO IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING. BUT THAT. I DID. IT WAS MENTIONED TO ME EARLIER. THAT THAT WAS IN THAT WAS AN ISSUE WHICH IS UNFATHOMABLE TO ME THAT YOU WOULD NOT WORK VERY HARD TO GET. SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN GAS -- A NEW UNIFORM AND MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING IN THERE THAT -- WE CAN WORK ON IT JUST MOVE MOVES FORWARD AND I WOULD WANT TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT BECAUSE THAT THAT ONE ACTUALLY DID MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME WHICH IS WHY. WE NEED. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PERSON THAT'S GETS GAS THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE. THAT WE DO WHATEVER TESTING WE NEED TO DO TO ENSURE THAT I BELIEVE. THAT THE THE MEMBERS AND THE ACLU ARE CONCERNED NOT ONLY -- FROM RETALIATION FROM. FROM PEOPLE THEIR INMATES BUT THERE THE NINETY DAY. SHOULD BE CONCERNED AT LAW ENFORCEMENT RETALIATE BECAUSE THEY'VE HEARD ONE OF THEIR OWN. AND SO OF BLOOD. LISTEN TO THE THE MEMBERS AND IF THERE'S ANY WAY YOU CAN PROVIDE MORE EVIDENCE WHERE IT THAT WON'T. OR WHATEVER STEPS YOU HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THAT WON'T HAPPEN ON BOTH SIDES -- I THINK WILL HELP WITH THE REST OF THE MEMBERS HERE. AND SO CHURCH RECOMMEND AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. ON EIGHTY TO NINETY FOUR THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER. HI JOHN SIR HI LACKEY. LACKEY ALLY BARRICADE HAND. BAUER-KAHAN I DEEP -- DEATH HI KAMLAGER-DOVE I QUIRK. QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. WICKS HI WICKS I THE MEASURE PASSES RIGHT. ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB. TWO SEVEN SEVEN ROLL REINTEGRATION YES WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS IS A FAMILIAR BILL FOR SOME OF YOU INCLUDING THE CHAIR. THIS IS AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN REINTEGRATION CREDITS SENSIBLE GIVE PEOPLE ON PAROLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN RE INTEGRATION CREDITS. BOB TO REDUCE THEIR TERM ON PAROLE. WELL AS WE KNOW WHILE IN CONFINEMENT INMATES HAVE ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS WHICH ARE CAUGHT UPON COMPLETION CAN RATE CAN BE REDEEM FOR SORTING THEIR SENTENCE. HOWEVER AND FOR ALL WE DON'T HAVE THE SYSTEM AND THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF PAROLE AS A PUNISHMENT MODEL WHICH PUNISHES FAILURE AS OPPOSED TO ENCOURAGING. SUCCESS. THIS BILL WOULD MERE THE MILESTONE COMPLETION CREDITS BASED APPROACH. WHICH IS FROM PRESENT OF COURSE SO INDIVIDUAL BE INCENTIVIZED TO COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY GOALS. THE BILL LAYS OUT SPECIFICS AS FAR AS HOW MUCH TIME SOMEBODY ON PAROLE COULD EARN EACH YEAR FOR COMPLETING AN EDUCATION DEGREE. A COLLEGE COURSE OUR CLASS COMMUNITY SERVICE HOURS GOOD BEHAVIOR. AND OR A SUBSTANCE ABUSE HOW WILL ALSO HELP PUBLIC SAFETY BY REDUCING CASELOADS FOR PAROLE AGENTS WHO ARE OVERBURDENED. ALLOWING THEM TO FOCUS THEIR NEEDED TIME ON THOSE WHO NEED. EXTRA GUIDANCE WHILE ALLOWING THOSE WHO. WHO ARE PURSUING A PATH IN EDUCATION -- COMMUNITY SERVICE TO CONTINUE TO THRIVE. WITH ME TODAY. IS DAVID MUHAMMAD EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND DANIELLE A MEDINA. WHO IS AN UNDERGRADUATE SCHOLAR? AT UC BERKELEY. OUR WILL CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB. TWO SEVENTY SEVEN MY NAME IS DANIEL MEDINA I WORK WITH UNDERGROUND SCHOLARS INITIATIVE A PROGRAM THAT SUPPORTS CURRENTLY AND FORMERLY INCARCERATED AND SYSTEM IMPACTED PEOPLE IN ACCESSING HIGHER EDUCATION. I AM ALSO FULL TIME STUDENT AT UC BERKELEY. IN MY ROLE AS A STUDENT COORDINATOR I SEE FIRSTHAND HOW EDUCATION HAS WORKED AS AN EFFECTIVE RE ENTRY PLAN FOR PEOPLE ON PAROLE. OUR PROGRAM HAS A 1100% GRADUATION RATE AND MANY OF THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS TO HAVE GRADUATED FROM OUR PROGRAM ARE NOW PERSONALLY MASTERS PIECE CHEESE. PASTIES AND LAW DEGREES. AS A FORMERLY INCARCERATED STUDENT MYSELF I CAN ONLY SEE SAY THAT ACCESS TO EDUCATION HAS CHANGED THE COURSE OF MY LIFE. I WAS INCARCERATED FOR TEN YEARS AND IN HE AND THEN MY ASSOCIATES DEGREE WITH THE HOPES OF ATTENDING UC BERKELEY UPON MY RELEASE. I WANTED TO APPLY WHEN I WAS RELEASED BUT WAS AFRAID THAT BEING ON PAROLE WOULD AFFECT MY ACCEPTANCE SO I WAITED UNTIL I WAS OFF. IN MAY I WILL BE GRADUATING FROM UC BERKELEY WITH MY BACHELOR'S DEGREE I RECENTLY FOUND OUT THAT I WAS ACCEPTED INTO THE MASTERS PROGRAM AT UC BERKELEY AS WELL. EDUCATION WAS MY REENTRY PLAN. MY EXPERIENCE ON PAROLE LIMITED ME FROM GOALS. THERE WERE MANY TIMES THAT I WAS BARRED FROM BY PRO FROM ENGAGING IN FAMILY REUNIFICATION EVENTS BECAUSE THEY WERE OUTSIDE OF THE FIFTY MILE RADIUS OF MY PAROLE RESTRICTIONS. AS WELL AS BEING DENIED PERMISSION TO TRAVEL FOR WORK RELATED MEETINGS DUE TO SIMILAR PEARL RESTRICTIONS. THESE RESTRICTIONS HINDER RATHER THAN HELP MY RE ENTRY EXPERIENCE. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW FORMALLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS EARN CREDIT AND INCREASED TRAVEL RADIUS BY SHOWING THAT THEY ARE COMMITTED TO CHANGING THE TRAJECTORY OF THEIR LIVES TO EDUCATION. HIGHER EDUCATION PERSONS ARE VOLUNTARY LEN ACKERMAN OF PROP FIFTY SEVEN CREATED INCENTIVES ENCOURAGE INDIVIDUALS TO ENROLL IN SCHOOL AND COMPLETE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WHILE INCARCERATED. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THE SAME INCENTIVE SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THOSE ON PAROLE FOR UNDER STATE SUPERVISION AND UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE SELF BETTERMENT ASIDE FROM THEIR OWN DESIRE FOR CHANGE. IF HIGHER EDUCATION HAVE BEEN INCENTIVIZE FOR ME DURING THE TIME I WAS ON PAROLE AS THIS BILL WOULD DO. I WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE LIKELY TO APPLY AND ROLL DESPITE MY FEARS. THIS BILL WOULD NOT ONLY PROVIDE FORMAL TO CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION BUT WITH SIGNAL TO THEM THAT THE STATE AND THE PAROLE SYSTEM VALUE THEIR EFFORT. THIS BILL IS ALSO AN IMPORTANT STEP IN REDUCING RECIDIVISM AND INCREASING PUBLIC SAFETY. RESEARCH RECENT RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY DR HARDING A UC BERKELEY PROFESSOR SHOWS A 51% DECREASE IN RECIDIVISM FOR STUDENTS TO ACCESS COLLEGE PROGRAMS WHILE IN PRISON. BASED ON MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND WHAT I'VE SEEN AS A STAFF MEMBER UNDERGROUND SCHOLARS. I WOULD SAY THAT PERCENTAGE MAY BE EVEN HIGHER FOR FORMERLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS. THE PUBLIC SAFETY BENEFITS OF THIS BILL ARE ARE CLEAR. THE BILL REDUCE RECIDIVISM IMPROVE RE ENTRY AND STRENGTH IN THE PAST WAYS THAT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE UNDERGROUND SCHOLARS AND PROJECT REBOUND ARE CREATING TO GET FORMALLY INCARCERATED STUDENTS ENROLLED IN OUR UNIVERSITIES. FOR THESE REASONS I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU YES SIR A GOOD MORNING HAS CHAIRMAN A JONES SAWYER IN THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS DAVID MUHAMMAD AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM. I'M ALSO FORMER A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY ADMINISTRATOR AND WASHINGTON DC NEW YORK CITY AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA RUSH SERVE AS THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER OF ALAMEDA COUNTY. HI TESTIFIED TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB. TWO SEVEN SEVEN A BILL THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES OF PEOPLE ON PAROLE EASE THE BURDEN OF OVERWORK PAROLE AGENTS AND INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY. AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN WILL INCENTIVIZE PAROLEES TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS BY PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT CREDITS FOR EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS AS WELL AS CREDITS FOR COMPLETING TREATMENT PROGRAMS OF VOLUNTEERING AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT. THIS BILL WILL ENCOURAGE PAROLEES TO FOCUS ACTIVITY. BY PASSING AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN CALIFORNIA WILL JOIN THIRTY SIX OTHER STATES IN REFORMING THE PAROLE SYSTEM TO SHORTEN AND EFFECTIVE AN UNNECESSARILY LONG PERIOD OF SUPERVISION. THE CALIFORNIA WILL BECOME A LEADER BY TAKING A STEP FURTHER AND INCENTIVIZING ACHIEVEMENT. THE EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION THIS BILL IS CRITICAL IN EVIDENCE BASED A TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN RAND CORPORATION STUDY REVEALED THAT PEOPLE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHO COMPLETE AND EDUCATION PROGRAM WERE 43% LESS LIKELY TO BE SENT BACK TO PRISON AND THOSE WHO DID NOT. RESEARCH HAS ALSO SHOWN THAT CIVIC ENGAGEMENT GIVES PAROLEES GREATER CONNECTION TO THE COMMUNITY PURPOSE AND BELONGING AND THEREBY REDUCING RECIDIVISM. PAROLEES OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE INCENTIVES WILL INHERENTLY BE AT LESS RISK TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY TO BEGIN WITH AND WILL ALSO REDUCE THEIR RISK AS THE EARNED EDUCATION CREDITS AND COMPLETE TREATMENT PROGRAMS. AS LOWER RISK PAROLEES AREN'T TIME OFF PAROLE THIS WILL ALLOW PAROLE AGENTS TO FOCUS THEIR LIMITED TIME AND RESOURCES ON THE SMALL THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO POSE GREATER RISKS TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY. NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISION OF LOWER RISK PEOPLE IS AN EFFECTIVE A WASTE OF RESOURCE AND CAN EVEN LEAD TO WORSE OUTCOMES. ONE STUDY BY THE PEW CENTER ON THE STATE'S DETERMINE THAT AFTER FIFTEEN MONTHS OF SUPERVISION WITHOUT VIOLATION TO OFFENSE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A PAROLE THE WILL COMMIT A NEW CRIME DRAMATICALLY DECLINES. RECENT DETAILED STUDIES OF ARIZONA IN MISSOURI LEGISLATION PROVIDES CORRECT THAT PROVIDES CREDITS TO PRODUCE TO REDUCE PAROLE SUPERVISION. SHOW THAT NEW LAWS WERE ACHIEVING THEIR INTENDED IMPACT. PAROLE AGENTS CASE OLDER SMALLER CORRECTIONAL SPENDING WAS REDUCED AND THE RECIDIVISM RATE% OF PEOPLE AREN'T EARLY RELEASE NOT INCREASE. CALIFORNIA HAS EVEN IMPLEMENT A VERSION OF THIS UNDER AB ONE OH NINE CRIMINAL JUSTICE REALIGNMENT PEOPLE RELEASED FROM PRISON OPPOSE RELEASE COMMUNITY SUPERVISION WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN ON PAROLE ARE NOW UNDER PROBATION SUPERVISION. THEY CAN HAVE THEIR TERM THEIR SUPERVISION TERMINATED AFTER SIX MONTHS AND MUST HAVE THEIR PROBATION TERMINATED AFTER A YEAR IF THEY'RE NO VIOLATIONS A NEW OFFENSES ALTHOUGH THEIR ORIGINAL TERM SUPERVISION WAS THREE YEARS. AND NOW CALIFORNIA CAN IMPROVE UPON THIS OF THE TO REFRAIN FROM CRIME BUT TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS. AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN IS A WIN WIN WIN. ROLL THESE WILL IMPROVE THEIR OUTCOMES PAROLE AGENTS WILL HAVE IMPROVED WORKLOADS AND THE COMMUNITY WILL BE SAFER I STRONGLY URGE YES FALLS THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME AN ORGANIZATION. KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT. MICHAEL MENDOZA FROM THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION IS STRONG SUPPORT. ERIC ANDERSON FROM INITIATE JUSTICE PROD CO SPONSOR AND SUPPORT.

ROBERT NGUYEN OF ANTI RACISM COALITION ARE STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU ARE VICE CHAIRMAN LACKEY AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I PURCHASED. WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO EXPRESS OUR RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL -- ALTHOUGH WE SUPPORT STRONGLY REINTEGRATION CREDITS THE FACT IS THAT THIS BILL -- EXCLUDES A LARGE GROUP OF P. AND BEFORE I GO ON ME INTRODUCE MYSELF ON JANICE BALUCHI I'M A CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY I'M ALSO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE ALLIANCE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL SEX OFFENSE LAWS. AND WE'RE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT'S DEDICATED TO PROTECTING THE CONSTITUTION. ABOUT THE STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONS AS SUCH WE REPRESENT MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND FAMILIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- AS A BILL AS CURRENTLY WRITTEN ON THERE IS A VERY BROAD EXCLUSION -- THAT BASICALLY SAYS THAT ANYBODY WHO'S EVER BEEN CONVICTED OF A SEX OFFENSE -- WOULD NOT QUALIFY FOR THESE REINTEGRATION CREDITS -- WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUSION AS IMPROPER I'M AND THAT IN FACT -- THE BENEFITS TO PUBLIC SAFETY I REINTEGRATION CREDITS IT MAKES NO SENSE TO DENY -- IT DIDN'T. IT MAKES NO SENSE -- TO BASICALLY -- CARVE OUT FROM THAT PUBLIC SAFETY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF A SEX OFFENSE I'M AGAIN THE WAY THAT THE EXCLUSION IS WRITTEN IT WOULD APPLY TO EVERYBODY WHO WAS EVER BEEN CONVICTED OF A SEX OFFENSE. SO THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED DECADES AGO MAY IN FACT NOT BE THE REASON THAT THEY'RE ON PAROLE TODAY. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO SEX OFFENSES IN CALIFORNIA MANY OF THEM ARE NON CONTACT NONVIOLENT OFFENSES SO AGAIN THE BECAUSE OF THE BROAD LANGUAGE IT WOULD APPLY TO EVERYBODY -- WE HAVEN'T CURRENTLY MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE ON PAROLE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF A SEX OFFENSE. MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND OKAY -- AND NONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS OF FOR THE REINTEGRATION CREDITS AS I SAID SOME OF THEM HAVE IN FACT BEEN CONVICTED OF A NON CONTACT NON VIOLENT OFFENSE. IN ADDITION THERE ARE WELL OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO REGISTER AND WHO ARE NOT ON PAROLE BUT WHO ARE ONE STEP AWAY. FROM A CONVICTION NOT FOR ANOTHER SEX OFFENSE BECAUSE THEY'RE RE OFFENSE RATE FOR SOMEBODY TO COME ANOTHER SEX OFFENSE WHILE ON PAROLE IS LESS THAN 1%. AND THAT IS A STATISTIC FROM CDC ARE IT'S NOT MY PERSONAL OPINION IT'S NOT THE PERSONAL OPINION OF THE ORGANIZATION THIS IS CD CDC OUR STATISTICS. ARE THE CURRENT OUR BILL LANGUAGE ALSO WE BELIEVE WOULD NOT SURVIVE JUDICIAL SCRUTINY -- ANTACID STAFF HAS -- STATED VERY WELL A PAGE SEVEN OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- THERE'S A PROBLEM WITH EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE SO AND UNDER THE EQUAL PROTECTION CLAUSE -- IT DEMANDS THAT LIKE THINGS BE TREATED ALIKE SO IN THIS SITUATION PEARL THEY SHOULD BE TREATED ALIKE AND IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE BEEN CONVICTED OF A SEX OFFENSE AGAIN. I MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED FIFTY YEARS AGO WE HAVE PEOPLE ONOUR SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY WHO'S BEEN THERE FOR MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS I PERSONALLY AWARE OF SOME OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS. SO THE ALSO THE LAWS -- NGUYEN. THINGS ONE LIKE THINGS ARE NOT BEING TREATED ALIKE THE WAY THE pIS THERE A RATIONAL BASIS THE FACT IS THERE IS NO RATIONAL BASIS FOR THIS DISTINCTION -- BECAUSE AS I SAID THE RATE OF RE OFFENSE FOR A SEX OFFENDER IS LOW ON PAROLE IS LESS THAN 1% AGAIN A CDC ARE STATISTIC AND NOT MY PERSONAL OPINION. I'M IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THIS BILL WOULD SURVIVE JUDICIAL SCRUTINY WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT WOULD NOT SURVIVE THE TEST OF TIME. WHAT DO I MEAN BY THAT WELL LET ME ASK YOU THIS WHAT IF THE REINTEGRATION CREDITS WERE NOT MAIL INVALUABLE? TO AFRICAN AMERICANS JAPANESE OKAY MAN. I TODAY SUCH EXCLUSIONS WOULD BE SHOCKING AND CERTAINLY NOT SUPPORTED BUT HOW HOWEVER IN ANOTHER YEAR THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN CATERED CONSIDERED ACCEPTED. ABOUT THE ACCEPTABLE AND SUPPORT USED A FOUR MINUTE SO I'VE IN THE STATE HAS TO FIND. WE LEFT BARELY IN. THIS. ALL. OKAY. WELL I DID NOT FEEL FIVE MINUTES FROM NEW HUNDRED DIFFERENT WAYS YOU SAY IT OKAY. WELL LET ME WRAP IT UP THEN I DIDN'T KNOW THERE'S ANYBODY ALSO SIR A LOT I HAVE THE FULL FIVE MINUTES -- AND SO WHAT I'M ASKING YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IS THIS TO BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY TODAY BE A LEADER NOT A FOLLOWER AND THAT IS TO IN FACT OPPOSED. AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN AS IT'S CURRENTLY WRITTEN THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- LARRY MORSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION RESPECTFULLY OPPOSING ASSEMBLYMAN CARTES AB. TWO SEVENTY SEVEN THIS BILL IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS LAST YEAR'S A. B. NINETEEN FORTY WHICH CD EIGHT ALSO OPPOSED. AS WITH THAT BILL AMONG OUR CONCERNS WITH THE LACK OF DISQUALIFIER IS IN THE BILL. THE ONLY TYPE OF PAROLE THE EXCLUDED FROM ELIGIBILITY FOR THESE XCELERATED REINTEGRATION CREDITS WOULD BE THOSE WERE REGISTERED SEX OFFENDERS. UNLESS CDC R. AND B. P. H. DISQUALIFY CERTAIN PAROLEES EVERY OTHER TYPE OF PAROLE LEE IS ELIGIBLE FOR REINTEGRATION CREDITS. INCLUDING MURDERERS HUMAN TRAFFICKERS AND SCORES OF OTHER VIOLENT OFFENDERS. AND EVEN IF SUCH REGULATIONS ARE DRAFTED THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE. EQUAL PROTECTION LAWSUITS FILED ON BEHALF OF THOSE DISQUALIFIED JUST AS HAS HAPPENED WITH THE REGULATIONS AT CDC ARE WROTE FOR PROP. FIFTY SEVEN PAROLE THAT EXCLUDE SEX REGISTRANTS. CDA A BELIEVES AB. TWO SEVENTY SEVEN IS BAD POLICY. ALL THESE NEED A SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF SUPERVISED PAROLE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THEIR CHANCES OF SUCCESS. AND TO ASSURE THE LAW ABIDING PUBLIC THAT THEY ARE IN FACT REHABILITATED. WE KNOW FROM THE RECENT STUDY BY THE STATE AUDITOR BUT CDC OUR REHABILITATION PROGRAMS ARE DEEPLY FLAWED AND THE CDC OR IS NOT. SUCCESSFULLY REHABILITATING PRISONERS. IN ONE PORTION OF THE REPORT IT STATES THAT IT DID NOT FIND QUOTE AN OVERALL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INMATES COMPLETING COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. AND THEY'RE READ RECIDIVISM RATES END QUOTE. YET THIS BILL OFFERS TWO MONTHS A REINTERPRET IT REINTEGRATION CREDIT TO A FELON ON PAROLE FOR HAVING COMPLETED A COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT PROGRAM. APPARENTLY THE VERY PROGRAM FOUND INEFFECTIVE BY THE STATE AUDITOR. IN VIEW OF THE ALARMING CONCLUSIONS OF THE AUDITOR'S REPORT. IT SEEMS BOTH COUNTER INTUITIVE AND A DANGER TO PUBLIC SAFETY TO PROPOSE ACCELERATING THE TIME IN WHICH PAROLEES MAY BE RELEASED. FROM THE ONLY MEANINGFUL SUPERVISION SEE. TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE ON A PRODUCTIVE PATH. OR OVER SHORTENING ANY PERIOD OF SUPERVISION HERTZ CRIME VICTIMS. LAST TIME ON SUPERVISION MEANS THAT IT IS LESS LIKELY THAT A CRIME VICTIM WILL EVER COLLECT THE RESTITUTION THE DEFENDANT OWES BECAUSE A DEFENDANT WHO IS NOT UNDER ANY SUPERVISION. HAS ZERO INCENTIVE TO PAY. OF EVEN GREATER CONCERNS IT MEANS THAT ANY CONDITIONS OF SUPERVISION THE PROTECT VICTIMS. SUCH AS RESTRAINING ORDERS WILL NOT BE IN EFFECT AS LONG AS THEY SHOULD BE. WE ALL AGREE. THE PAROLEES BEST CHANCE TO AVOID BECOMING A RECIDIVISM STATISTIC IS TO PARTICIPATE IN. AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE A SPECIFIED AMOUNT OF EDUCATION JOB TRAINING COUNSELING AND OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE COUNSELING. NO. ONE IS MORE INVESTED IN CDA IN SUCCESSFUL PAROLE. AS PAROLE FAILURES CREATE MORE CRIME. AND MORE VICTIMS IN OUR COUNTIES AND ONLY OVERCROWDING PROBLEMS. WE ARE CONCERNED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL WILL CREATE MORE FAILURES THAN SUCCESS AND FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB. TWO SEVENTY SEVEN THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION NAME IN OR CAN IS ATION YES YOUR YOUR UP. NAME AN ORGANIZATION. JOINING DOCTOR ALLIGATOR TIRES HAS PSYCHOLOGIST CDC ARE AND A SO SO SEASON WITH EXCEL. OPPOSES BILL BASED SOLELY ON THE SEX OFFENDER. THANK YOU. YOUR MIND SACRAMENTO I PULLED THIS BILL THANK YOU SIR. ROGER ANY CUT BUSINESSMAN FROM MODESTO OPPOSE THIS BILL FOR ANGELES LEE BLOCKING ALL SEX OFFENSES. THANK YOU. CHARLES LOPEZ GROVE I OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. FRIDAY GLEE SANTA CLARA COUNTY I OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. FRANKLIN OR CNET RIVERSIDE COUNTY I OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU SIR. MICHAEL MEADOW ANYA ELK GROVE CALIFORNIA I OPPOSE THIS BILL BASED ON THE SEXUAL. OF THE LEAVING OUT THE SEXUAL OFFENDERS AND I THINK THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED THANK YOU. JERRY SACRAMENTO FAMILY SAFETY FOUNDATION MOTHER AN ABUSE SURVIVOR I CURRENTLY OPPOSE THIS BILL WITH THE KERN EXCLUSIONS THANK YOU. IN AN INTERVIEW CAN EDUCATED FROM SAN MATEO COUNTY I OPPOSE THIS BILL TO TO THE EXCLUSION OF SEX OFFENDERS THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY A WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MR QUIRK -- SO I UNDERSTAND THE POSITION OF THE ALLIANCE FOR CONSTITUTIONAL SEX OFFENSE LAWS. AND I I WOULD EMBRACE IT HOWEVER I MAY BE THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS TO VOTE WHO WOULD. AND FOR THAT REASON I SUPPORT THE BILL AS IS BECAUSE AGAIN I'M UNUSUAL -- YOU MENTION SEX ANY KIND OF A SEX CRIME ON THE FLOOR OF THE SENATE OR THE ASSEMBLY. AND IT JUST DOESN'T. DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE SO THAT'S THE REASON AND I THINK THAT. WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC -- PERHAPS IF THIS PROGRAM IS SUCCESS IF WE ACTUALLY GET IT PASSED WHICH WILL STILL BE DIFFICULT -- AND SIGNED. WE CAN LOOK AT SEX OFFENDERS LATER ON BUT RIGHT NOW -- I MIGHT BE THE ONLY ONE VOTING. FOR SO THAT BEING SAID -- I KNOW THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS HAVE SOME CONCERNS -- MR -- MCCARTY -- PERHAPS YOU COULD TALK TO THEM ABOUT THE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR ARE MENTIONED IN YOUR CLOTHES AS TO WHETHER OR NOT YOU THINK THAT IS APPROPRIATE BUT I THINK ALL THE OTHER. I AND I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU CAN MENTION THAT YOUR CLOTHES AND IF THERE ANY OTHER CONCERNS YOU HAVE. THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S REYES -- I WILL THEN MOVED TO BAIL SEC. HEY MISS. BARKIN. AT SOMEWHERE MCCARTY ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION IT'S MY READING OF THE BILL THAT IT WOULD BE TWELVE MONTHS BEFORE THEY WOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR THESE CREDITS IS THAT RIGHT. OKAY AND I'M. AND I WOULD JUST ECHO ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRKS COMMENTS REGARDING THE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT WHEN I HEAR FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS IS THAT. EDUCATION JOB TRAINING SUBSTANCE ABUSE ALL HELP US REDUCE RECIDIVISM I WANT TO THANK YOU BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO BE DOING. DOING MORE TO HELP REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S WORK THAT IS IMPORTANT IN OUR CHAMBERS BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT WERE INCLUDING CREDITS FOR THINGS. THEY DON'T REDUCE RECIDIVISM I THINK WE SHOULD CONSIDER AMENDING THE BILL MOVING FORWARD SO THAT WERE FOCUSED ON THE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY MAKING AN IMPACT ON PEOPLE. I'LL CALL ADDRESSED THE IN THE END OF INDIAN. IF ANY OTHER COMMENTS COMMITTEE MEMBER. YOU MAY CLOSE WITH MCCARTY YEAH THANK YOU YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO THREAD THE NEEDLE HERE AND OF COURSE -- ADDRESS THIS ISSUE I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE HAD SOME CHANGES IN THAT TO NINETY LAW WITH THE TEARS AS FAR AS PEOPLE WHO ARE REGISTERED SEX OFFENDERS AND SO. I I HEAR THE ARGUMENT WE'RE CONTINUING TO TO THE VALUE WOULD THAT LOOK AT THAT AND IF THIS GETS OUT HERE GOES TO APPROPRIATIONS WILL. WILL LOOK AT AS WELL -- AS THE ISSUES THAT YOU RAISED MISTER QUIRK AND UNISTAR CAN -- THOSE ARE THIS IS THAT IDENTICAL BILL FROM LAST YEAR AND THOSE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT WE WENT BACK AND FORTH WITH SOME CONCERN PARTY'S LAST YEAR AND SO WILL. LOOK AT THAT THIS IS THE STRONGEST VERSION TODAY WERE STARTING THE PROCESS -- I DID WANT TO ALLOW MY WITNESS TO ADDRESS THAT SPECIFIC ISSUE THEM A VERY QUICKLY SO THE CVT COGNITIVE THERAPY THAT WAS REFERENCED ABOVE THE ASSOCIATION ABOUT BEING EFFECTIVE IS SPECIFICALLY IT. INSIDE OF THE PRISON SYSTEM AND HOW IT WAS CONDUCTED INSIDE THE PRISON SYSTEM NOT TO HOW THIS WOULD BE CONDUCTED CD. C. B. T. AS EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF RESEARCH ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS REDUCE RECIDIVISM -- POSSIBLY BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE -- AND IT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM GOING TO A C. B. T. CLASS WHEN YOU'RE OUTSIDE VERSES IN THE CHAOTIC SYSTEM OF INSIDE OF A PRISON. THANK YU THAT'S A GOOD EXPLANATION. AND JUST AYE LASTLY IN CLOSING THANK YOU FOR THAT FOR THE CONSIDERATION IN MOTION THE SECOND. I THINK IF YOU ASK PEOPLE ABOUT PAROLE DO THEY WANT PEOPLE AND FOR ALL TO BE GOING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO BE GOING TO A PROGRAM TO WORKING FOR A COMMUNITY SERVICE ORG -- PROGRAM TO DOING VOLUNTEER WORK THEY SAY YEAH. AND IF YOU ASK PEARL AGENTS WITH A RATHER HAVE THEIR PAROLEES DOING THAT THEY WOULD JUMP UP AND SAY YES OF COURSE I THINK IT'S POWERFUL THEY'RE NOT HERE OPPOSING THIS BILL TODAY BECAUSE THEY REALIZE. THAT THE MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE OFFER PAROLE DOING THIS TYPE A GOOD ACTIVITY THE MORE TIME THEY CAN FOCUS ON THE PEOPLE THAT NEED THE HELP AND SO THIS IS. A SMART POLICY TO REWARD GOOD BEHAVIOR LIKE WE DO INSIDE. THE WALLS OF PRISON ON THE OUTSIDE AS WELL AS MAKING SURE WE FOR YOUR PART TIME FOR ALL OUR PAROLE PERSONNEL TO DO THE WORK YOU NEED TO DO SO WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AN AT AND AS SOMEONE. WHO I DON'T KNOW FLOOR? BLOODIED ON THE FLOOR TRYING TO GET THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY BECAUSE I WAS ASKED BY JACKIE LACEY. THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF LOS ANGELES TO LOOK AT THAT TO TO TEAR IT DO MORE WITH IT -- I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO GET SOMETHING HAS A REFERENCE A SEX OFFENDER -- OUT OF THIS HOUSE -- IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT -- AND SO I COMMEND YOU FOR FOR FOR FOR UNDERSTANDING AND COULD IT IS DIFFICULT AND ALSO WOOD MISTER QUIRK SAID ABOUT -- TRYING TO DO THINGS IN A PERFECT PASSION AND THEN HAVE. THE BILL DIE AND WE DON'T HELP ANYONE. I MEAN THAT'S THAT BOTHERS ME TO NO END WE WE GET A LOT OF HAT -- WITH OUR SPONSORS AND THEN ADVOCATES OUT THERE IN BRAWL WELL MEANING BUT SOMETIMES YOU JUST GOT TO GET SOMETHING DONE TO HELP. AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE WHICH IS WHAT THIS DONE. AND IN LASTLY -- I WANT TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHO ASKED FOR THE AUDIT. OF CDC OUR PROGRAMS LET'S MAKE IT VERY CLEAR. THE PURPOSE OF IT WAS ONE TO FIND OUT OF CDC ARE. COULD QUANTIFY HOW EFFECTIVE IT IS. DAY THEIR PROGRAMS ARE. ONE MAYBE THE PROS ARE HAFTER PROGRAMS DIDN'T HAVE A MECHANISM TO TO DETERMINE WHETHER NOT THEY WERE EFFECTIVE OR NOT AND THOSE ARE ONCE THEY KIND OF SLAM. BUT THE COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR IN SOME OF THEY GOT HIGH MARKS ON STILL NEEDS SOME WORK TO DO TO BE ABLE TO SHOW THEIR EFFECTIVENESS AND THAT WAS A REAL PURPOSE. OF THE AUDIT NOT TO SLAM CDC ARE NOT. TO SAY THAT THEY DON'T DO IT CORRECTLY. BUT AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO FIND OUT WHICH PROGRAMS ACTUALLY WORK AND WHICH ONES WE NEED TO IMPROVE. ME SAY THAT ONE MORE TIME. IT WAS TO FIND OUT WHICH PROGRAMS WORKED SO WE CAN CONTINUE THOSE AND THEN WHICH ONES NEEDED IMPROVEMENT SO WE CONTINUE CONTINUE THOSE. AND IF THERE WAS SOME THAT AFTER ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND MONEY. THAT THEY DIDN'T WORK WE WOULD LET THEM GO BY THE WAYSIDE AND SO THIS THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF REHABILITATION WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS THE BEST NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT BEST IN THE COUNTRY AND HOPE FOR THE BEST IN THE WORLD. THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE AUDIT NOT TO SLAM CDC ARE. AND AND TO MOVE FORWARD THERE WILL BE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BE POURED INTO REHABILITATION THIS IS WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WILL IMPROVE AND CDC ARC. AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS ALL THE CONCERNS. EVEN PEOPLE WHO ARE IN STAN -- THEY HAVE A SPECIAL TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED THAT'S DIFFERENT FROM A REGULAR INMATE AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT ALSO BECAUSE THAT'S WHY WHEN THEY LEAVE THEY HAVE A DIFFERENT PROBATION. THEY CAN'T THEY CAN'T LIVE ANYWHERE THEY WANT THERE'S JUST DIFFERENT AND SO WE NEED TO TAKE THAT ALL IN CONSIDERATION AS MR QUIRK SAID IF WE MOVE FOR WITH SOMETHING ELSE. WE NEED TO TAKE ALL OF THAT IN CONSIDERATION SO THAT WE CAN GET IT PASSED. NOT ONLY IN THIS ASSEMBLY THE SENATE AND ULTIMATELY TO GET THE GOVERNOR TO SIGN SO THE CHURCH RECOMMEND AND I VOTE. ON EIGHTY TWO SEVEN SEVEN BY MCCARTY THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER HI JOHN SIR I LACKEY. LACKEY NO BARRICADE HAN. BAUER-KAHAN I DEEP. HI. DEEP I KAMLAGER-DOVE. KAMLAGER-DOVE I QUIRK. QUIRK I SAN DIEGO SAN DIEGO I WEEKS FIVE WEEKS I THAT MEASURE PASSES JERRY JONES SAWYER YOU MAY BEGIN I'LL MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE THE RESOLUTION THANK YOU NOW GO QUICKLY. AND NOT TALK PASSED THE S. OKAY. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION FIVE URGES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO USE CALIFORNIA IS A MODEL FOR REASONABLE. FIRE ARM SAFETY AS WE WORK TO PASS NATIONWIDE FIREARM SAFETY REGULATION. DATA PROVIDED BY THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION SHOWS CALIFORNIA HAD SOME OF THE WORST GUN HOMICIDES AND GUN DEATH RATES TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. IN COMPARISON THE REST OF THE NATION CALIFORNIA RANKED THIRD IN GUN HOMICIDES AND SIXTEENTH AND GUN DEATHS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES BUT BY TWENTY SIXTEEN APPROVED TO TWENTY FIFTH. AND GUN HOMICIDES. PER CAPITA WITH EIGHTH LOWEST RATE OF GUN RELATED DEATHS NATIONWIDE CALVET CALIFORNIA'S MADE AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE ITS GUN VIOLENCE STATISTICS TO MULTIPLE COMMON SENSE FIREARMS LEGISLATION. WHILE SOME MIGHT ARGUE THIS RESOLUTION IS NOT NEEDED LET ME POINT OUT. POINT THEM TO AN FBI STUDY THAT FOUND 75% OF PARENTS USE IN A MASS YOU JUDY WERE PURCHASED IT LEGALLY. THIS IS WHY AJ ARE FIVE IS NEEDED TO LET FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NO IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC THAT THIS NATION ADDRESSES IS GUN VIOLENCE BY CREATING. UNIVERSAL GUN. SPIRAL I'M SAFETY STANDARDS THAT ARE STRONG AND SENSIBLE STANDARDS LIKE CALIFORNIA'S GUN VIOLENCE COST THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND DIRECT INDIRECT COSTS WHICH IS ROUGHLY ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS PER AMERICAN. CONTINUE TO SUBJECT OUR COMMUNITY SAID THE PAIN THE PROVEN WAY REDUCING GUN VIOLENCE THIS RESOLUTION MAKES IT CLEAR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO TAKE ACTION BY CREATING STRONGER. FIREARM SAFETY STANDARDS BEFORE THE NEXT MASS SHOOTING HAPPENS FOR THIS REASON I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE HERE TO TESTIFY AS AMANDA WILCOX. FROM DO YOU CHANGE YOUR NAME AGAIN CALIFORNIA BRADY UNITED AGAINST GUN VIOLENCE. AND DANNY CAN DO [inaudible] CANADA [inaudible] KAISER. CANDOR SHE GET HYPHENATED NAMES CAN THE KAISER FROM GIFFORD'S LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. UGH GOOD MORNING STILL MOURNING -- YES AMANDA WILCOX FROM. BRADY HEALTH BRADY CALIFORNIA. GUN VIOLENCE DOESN'T ROLL OFF MY TONGUE YET -- IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THE SCHOOLYARD SHOOTING HAPPENED AT CLEVELAND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN STOCKTON CALIFORNIA. AND UNLIKE WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING AT ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TOOK ACTION IN A BIPARTISAN WAY. AND CALIFORNIA PASSED THE FIRST SINCE BàN WE IN ACTIVE UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. ARE A TEN DAY WAITING PERIOD LATER ARE. AND A NUMBER OF THE POLICIES ARE MENTIONED IN THE RESOLUTION THAT MY PREDECESSORS OR I PERSONALLY WORKED ON CALIFORNIA -- AS YOU HEARD WAS DID NOT RANK VERY WELL AMONG -- THE NATION IN TERMS OF GUN DEATHS IN FARM DEATH RATE IN CALIFORNIA. IT TAKES A FEW YEARS FOR OUR LAWS TO BE IMPACT -- IMPLEMENTED INTO START REALIZING THE BENEFITS. BUT WE WENT FROM HIGH IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE TO WHERE WE ARE NOW. WITH THEIR GUN DEATH RATE A DROP OF 55%. THAT'S ALMOST FOUR TIMES GREATER THAN THE DROPPING FIREARM DEATHS FROM THE REST OF THE NATION SO I CONTEND THAT OUR GUN LAWS ARE WORKING -- WE ARE DOING A BETTER JOB OF KEEPING GUNS OUT OF DANGER STANDS AND I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION THAT OUR GUN SALES IN RECENT YEARS HAVE BEEN A RECORD HIGH WE'RE NOT STOPPING LAW ABIDING CITIZENS FROM PURCHASING GUNS. BUT WE'RE DOING A BETTER GUN OUT OF THOSE ARE BETTER JOB KEEPING GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE -- WHO ARE AT RISK OF FEW TRACKS COME VIOLENCE? I WOULD HOPE THAT OUR NATION WOULD FOLLOW CALIFORNIA'S LEAD ON THIS UP WE'VE COURSE ARE IMPACTED BY WEEK GUN LAWS IN THE REST OF THE NATION GUNS DO NOT NECESSARILY STOP AT STATE BORDERS -- MY TWO SONS LIVE IN COLORADO I HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS MICHIGAN. PENNSYLVANIA NEW JERSEY HOLLOW OVER AND I SO THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS STATEMENT THAT ARE CALIFORNIA IS TAKING THE LEAD AND WE WANT THE NATION THE FOLLOWING THEY NEED TO ACT. WE SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION. GOOD MORNING DANIEL KENDO KAISER ON BEHALF OF GIVE FOR ITS LAW CENTER IN IT TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE WE TOO ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE RESOLUTION -- TO ADD TO THE CHAIRMAN'S. STATISTICS THAT HE STATED -- CALIFORNIANS ARE NOW 21% LESS LIKELY TO BE MURDERED WITH A GUN. ACCIDENTAL SHOOTING AND 45% LESS LIKELY TO DIE -- FROM A FIRE ARM RELATED SUICIDE. WE SINCERELY HOPE THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WILL VOTE TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION AND SEND THE MESSAGE TO THE FEDERAL LAW MAKERS. THAT MUCH CAN BE LEARNED FROM CALIFORNIA'S. SUCCESSES THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. BACK BAY AREA STUDENT ACTIVISTS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU I JIM LIMBURG ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU WITNESSES OPPOSITION THEY BEGIN. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND CHAIRMAN -- CHAMP READ AS REPRESENTING GUNNERS CALIFORNIANS AND I ACTUALLY HAD. TO WRITE THIS ONE DOWN TO MAKE SURE I AM IN OUR OUR POINTS -- WE WE OPPOSE A G. R. FIVE FOR THE SAME REASON THAT -- WE OPPOSED A BIASED AND POLITICIZED RESEARCH. OFTEN IT'S ANOTHER NEITHER FACTUAL OR SINCERE IN ITS JUSTIFICATION CALIFORNIA HAS. A G. R. FIVE NOTES HAS SOME OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE AN INTRUSIVE GUN CONTROL LAWS IN THE COUNTRY. AND YET THOSE LAWS OF FAILED TO PREVENT MASS MURDERS AND ACTS OF TERRORISM COMMITTED BY EVIL PEOPLE ASKING CONGRESS TO USE. THE EXAMPLE OF CALIFORNIA GUN LAWS AS A TEMPLATE FOR FEDERAL LAWS WOULD GUARANTEE THE SAME FAILURES ON A NATIONWIDE BASIS. A JUROR FIVE DECLARES THAT THE RATE OF GUN YEARS AT A RATE FASTER THAN THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. AND ATTRIBUTES THAT TO GUN CONTROL LAWS THE RESOLUTION FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CRIME RATES BEGAN TO DROP. WHEN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTED STRONG PENALTIES FOR VIOLENT CRIMES WITH LONGER SENTENCES NO ONE DISPUTES THAT A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION? ACCOUNT FOR MOST OF THE GUN DEBTS IN THE STATE. AFTER SUICIDE. AND IT STANDS TO REASON THAT IF YOU INCARCERATE THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED VIOLENT CRIMES AND KEEP THEM OFF THE STREETS. THE VIOLENT CRIME WILL GO DOWN IN RECENT YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS UNFORTUNATELY RIZ REVERSED THAT TREND OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. AND IS NOW REDUCING -- PENALTIES AND AND SENSES EVEN FOR VIOLENT OFFENDERS WHO USE A GUN TO COMMIT THEIR CRIMES NOT SURPRISINGLY. THE SAME CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL REPORT QUOTED IN THE RESOLUTION STATES THAT CRIMINAL GUN DEBTS. ARE ON THE RISE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A SINCE THE LEGISLATURE IMPLEMENTED EARLY RELEASE -- TYPE POLICIES SO IT'S FOR THESE IN AN AND OTHER REASONS THAT WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSES THIS RESEARCH -- A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD AND RE WITH NATIONAL RIGHT SO SEE XIN IN OPPOSITION -- I BROUGHT. OUR CALIFORNIA GUN LAWS BOOK HERE THIS WAS DRAFTED BUYER ATTORNEYS IT'S OVER SIX HUNDRED PAGES. AND IT DOESN'T COVER EVERYTHING BEING A GUN -- AND I GET CALLS AND I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES HERE GET CALLS EVERY WEEK. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CONFUSED ON HOW TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW THEY WANT TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW. AND THERE ARE TIMES WHERE I GET PEOPLE THAT CALL ME WHO HAVE SOMETHING THAT THEY MAY HAVE LEARNED LEGALLY PURCHASE IN THE STATE AT ONE TIME. THAT'S NOW NO LONGER LEGAL AND THERE THEY MIGHT BE FACING CHARGES ARE THEY INADVERTENTLY VIOLATED SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY A NON VIOLENT ACT JUST BECAUSE OF THIS JUST. ONCE A LOT OF OF SO MANY LAWS ON ON HOW YOU CAN CARRY HOW TO STORE -- WHAT TO PURCHASE WHO YOU CAN LONG TO WHO YOU CAN'T ACCEPT OR ECCENTRIC CETERA? AND I THINK THAT THE PENALTIES REALLY SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THE CRIMINALS AND AND THESE ALSO JUST SO ONEROUS ON THE LAW ABIDING. AND MEANWHILE WE HAVE THIS ACT PROGRAM THAT HAS TEN THOUSAND PLUS KNOWN PROHIBITED PERSONS ON THERE. THAT WE'RE JUST NOT DOING A GREAT JOB OF CLEARING THE BACKLOG AND SO I DON'T THINK THE CALIFORNIA'S THE MODEL ON THAT I THINK WE NEED TO GET TOUGHER ON THOSE PROHIBITED PERSONS AND THOUGHT WHEN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN ROY GRIFFIS SPEAKING ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE ANDPISTOL ASSOCIATION WERE ALSO IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS MARKET REPEAT MY COLLEAGUES ALREADY SAID BUT ONE THING THAT REALLY ANGERS ME MANY OF YOU KNOW MY BACKGROUND THIRTY TWO YEARS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT POOR I TOOK THIS POSITION. KILLING CRIMINALS UNDERSTAND IS TOUGH PENALTIE AND WHO WE ARE MAKING MORE LAWS AGAINST LAW ABIDING WHILE THE SAME. COMMITTEE HERE ROLLED OUT SENATE BILL SIX TWENTY A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHICH JUST ROLLS BACK THE FOLKS THAT CHOOSE IN THEIR MIND. TO USE A FARM THE COMMISSION OF A OF A CRIME AND WE'RE MAKE I'M WE HAD ONE MORE BREAKING THE LAW ABIDING WON'T WON'T FOR THOSE REASONS. WE OPPOSE THIS MEASURE CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MEMBERS ON DíAS. WORKS I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL -- AND REGARDING THE COMMENTS ABOUT HOW DIFFICULT IT IS FOR LAW ABIDING GUN OWNERS.
