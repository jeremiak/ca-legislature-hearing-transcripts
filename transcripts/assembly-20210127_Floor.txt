WE ARE FILLED WITH GREAT EXPECTATIONS FOR THE GREAT NEXT CHAPTER THAT YOU HAD TO BRING. THANK YOU MR HOLDEN CHÃ¡VEZ BURKE YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS I AM HONORED TO RISE ON BEHALF OF THE WOMAN'S POCKETS TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF DR SHIRLEY WEBER FOR SECRETARY OF STATE. DR WEBER IS A FORCE OF NATURE. ONE WE RARELY SEE. AND WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO ELEVATE SOMEONE OF HER CALIBER AND QUALIFICATION RICE WE SHOULD NEVER HESITATE. BECAUSE WHEN SOMEONE LIKE DR WEBER RISES SHE DOES NOT RISE ALONE. AND OUR VOICE IS NOT HERS ALONE IT OCCURS WITH THE WISDOM AND STRENGTH OF THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE HER AND PAVE THE WAY FOR OTHERS TO FOLLOW. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE. WHEN SURELY IS ON THE MIKE. EVERYONE ON THE FLOOR KNOWS TO STOP AND LISTEN. WE START NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE WE WANT TO HEAR WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY. WE STOPPED BECAUSE WE KNOW WHETHER WE AGREE OR NOT WE ARE BETTER FOR HAVING WHICH IS. EACH ONE OF US HAS BEEN INSPIRED BY OUR VOICE IT IS STOOD IN AWE OF HER GRACE UNDER FIRE. EACH ONE OF US HAS BEEN INSPIRED TO BE. INSPIRED BY HER AND I STOOD IN AWE OF HER RECENT APART SHE'S AN EDUCATOR BY TRADE AND AT TIMES THIS TERM IS VERY BUILDING. INTO A CLASSROOM. WE HAVE WITNESSED HER COMPASSION FOR PEOPLE OF EVERY RACE AND ETHNICITY TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT WITH DOCTOR WEBER AND SECRETARY STATE. EVERY VOICE WILL BE HEARD IN EVERY VOTE WILL BE COUNTED. WE HAVE ARRIVED AT THIS MOMENT BECAUSE OF OUR CONTINUED FIGHT AGAINST VOTER SUPPRESSION. BLACK WOMEN IN OUR ABILITY TO BRIDGE THE GREAT DIVIDE AND CREATE ACCESS FOR OTHERS TO TRY TO BLOCK IT HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL TO THE SIDE. OF THIS COUNTRY. WE NEED TO LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THE LATEST ELECTION IN GEORGIA AND TO. TO THE WORK OF PRIOR BY STACEY ABRAMS TO SEE THE EFFECT THAT ONE BLACK WOMAN. CAN HAVE ON THE COUNTRY. DR WEBER WILL BE THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO SERVE AS SECRETARY OF STATE. THIS IS A TRIUMPH AND TRAGEDY. AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO DO. DOCTORS WEBER DEPLOYMENT WITH AN ANSWER TO A CALL LONG IGNORED. HER AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT FOR EQUITY AND JUSTICE LONG BEFORE HER TENURE IN THIS LEGISLATURE HAS EARNED FOR THIS POSITION. AND PARTS OF THE COUNTRY SHOULD BE DISMISSED OUTRIGHT. AND FOR OUR BLACK COMMUNITY. I DON'T VIEW THIS NOMINATION AS AN EXCHANGE BUT AS A PROMISE. THAT THERE WILL BE EQUAL REPRESENTATION IN THE HIGHEST OFFICES IN CALIFORNIA AND FAR BEYOND. THIS I A TREMENDOUS MOMENT. IT IS PROGRESS FOR WOMEN. AND BLACK WOMEN IN PARTICULAR. BUT TRUST ME WHEN I SAY ALL OF CALIFORNIA WILL BENEFIT FROM HER SERVICE. WE STILL OFFICE WENT TO SEE BE SEEN AND LEADERS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE OFTEN PREACH ABOUT CALIFORNIA VALUES. WITH DR WEBBER HE HOME I BELIEVE WE WILL BE THE MODEL FOR ELECTED PARTICIPATION OUTREACH INCLUSIVITY AND DEMOCRACY. DR WEBER WE'VE HEARD TO SAY SO MANY TIMES IF YOU KNOW BETTER YOU DO BETTER. I THINK I SPEAK FOR ALL OF US WHEN I SAY THAT WE ARE BETTER FOR KNOWING HIM. THANK YOU. FOR ALL THAT YOU'VE DONE FOR THE PEOPLE OF THE CALIFORNIA ALREADY. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW YOU CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR WHAT IS RIGHT. AND JUST. A SECRETARY OF STATE. I PROBABLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR DR SHIRLEY WEBER FOR SECRETARY OF STATE. THANK YOU MISS BURKE. MISTER GIBSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS. I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TO RAISE MY MICROPHONE AND SPEAKER SUPPORT A DOCTOR SHIRLEY NASH WEBER CONFIRMATION TO BE CALIFORNIA'S FIRST BLACK SECRETARY OF THIS GREAT STATE. DR SHIRLEY NASH WEBER WON SAID AND I QUOTE I COME OUT. OF A LEGACY THAT SAYS. IF YOU DON'T KICK KICK IF YOU DID YOU'D KEEP KICKING AT THE DOOR YOU WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO WEAR THE DOOR DOWN. OR HAVE IT OPENED. DR WEBER HAS BEEN KICKING IN THE DOOR. DR SHIRLEY WEBER HAS KICKED IN THE DOOR NOW. SHE. TICKET A DOOR OF ETHNIC STUDIES COURSES AT CAL STATE DR WEBER KEEP KICKING IN THE DOOR WHO BROUGHT US A C. FIVE BECAUSE HE KEPT KICKING IN THE DOOR DR WEBER KEPT KICKING IN THE DOOR AND BROUGHT US AB THIRTY ONE TWENTY ONE REPARATIONS THAT WAS SIGNED BY THIS GOVERNOR DR WILBER KEEP KICKING IN THE DOOR AND REIMAGINE A JUST AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BY INTRODUCING ASSEMBLY BILL THREE NINETY TO THE CHANGE THE USE OF DEADLY FORCE. IN THIS STATE. MANY OF YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW THE DOCTOR. SHIRLEY NASH WEBER. LED ARKANSAS WITH HER FAMILY AT FIVE YEARS OF AGE I GREW UP IN THE PROJECTS A SOUTH LOS ANGELES. SHE BECAME A TEACHER AT TWENTY THREE YEARS OF AGE. EARNED HER PHD AT TWENTY SIX SERVICE SAN DIEGO BOARD OF EDUCATION BEFORE COMING TO THIS BODY TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY. I WORKING ON GROUND BREAKING LEGISLATION DR WEBER NEVER BACKED DOWN FROM A CHALLENGE OR FIGHTS. SHE'S BEEN A TRAILBLAZER FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND OTHER COMMUNITIES EMPIRE NEWS AND STOOD AGAINST RACISM DISCRIMINATION. SHE HAS BEEN THE PERSON WHO SPOKE TRUTH TO POWER. ANY TIME ANYTIME DR WEBER SPEAK. WE ALL LISTEN BECAUSE SHE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY. SHE'S EXEMPLARY ACCOMPLISHMENTS. IN THIS NEW OFFICE THAT SHE WILL NOW HOME SHE IS DESERVING OF IT. SHE LEAVES THIS BODY. A DEEP VOICE. IN THE LEGISLATURE AND I HOPE THAT WE COME TOGETHER TO FILL THAT VOID BUT CALIFORNIA IS LOOKING TO HAVE. THIS GREAT THIS GREAT STATE I WANT TO THANK GOD BECAUSE HE MADE IT POSSIBLE. THEN SECONDLY I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE. BUT HEARING THE VOICE AND DID THIS GREAT BODY THAT WE SERVE ON WITH A RESOUNDING I VOTE. MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER AYE VOTE ON THE CONFIRMATION OF DOCTOR SHIRLEY NASH WEBER. THANK YOU MISTER GIPSON. MR BERMAN. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER WHEN I FIRST HEARD THE DOCTOR WEBER WAS UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE APPOINTMENT THEY CALL ME A BIT BY SURPRISE IT WAS A BIT OUT OF THE BLUE. AND THEN I QUICKLY REALIZED JUST HOW MUCH SENSE THE CHOICE MAKES. THE DAUGHTER OF SHARECROPPERS WHO WAS BORN IN THE PRE CIVIL RIGHTS SOUTH- MOVED TO SOUTH L. A. AS A CHILD AND WENT ON TO BEOME ONE OF THE YOUNGEST EVER PROFESSORS AT SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY. FORTY YEARS LATER. DR WEBER IS AN UNQUESTIONED MORAL LEADER. IN ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE. SHE ISN'T AFRAID TO SPEAK TRUTH TO POWER EVEN IF THAT MEANS DISAGREEING WITH THEIR OWN COLLEAGUES IN OUR OWN PARTY. AND WHEN SHE SPEAKS. EVERYONE SHUTS UP AND LISTENS. I EVEN SAW THREE FROM DANA WILLIAMSON YESTERDAY FORMER CABINET SECRETARY TO GOVERNOR BROWN. HE SAID THAT WHEN DR WEBER WOULD SPEAK ON THE FOR GOVERNOR BROWN WHICH JUST EVERYONE IN THE ROOM SO HE COULD LISTEN. MY GUESS IS HE DIDN'T DO THAT FOR THE REST OF US. WE NOW FIND OURSELVES AS A STATE IN THE NATION. AND AN UNEXPECTED TIME WHERE DEMOCRACY IS UNDER ATTACK. LIES AND MISINFORMATION HAVE CONVINCED TENS OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS. AND MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS THAT THEY CAN'T TRUST THE ELECTION RESULTS IN OUR COUNTRY. THE POPLE SPREADING THESE LIES HAVE WEAKENED OUR DEMOCRACY. IT IS ANGRY AS THAT MAKES ME THAT THESE UNSUBSTANTIATED LIES HAVE BEEN SPREAD TO INTENTIONALLY WEAKEN AMERICA THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE. WHICH IS WHY DR WEBER WITH HER UNIMPEACHABLE INTEGRITY AND MORAL CLARITY IS THE RIGHT PERSON TO REPAIR THAT DAMAGE AND THE STRENGTH IN ALL CALIFORNIANS FAITH. IN OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT SHE IS THE RIGHT CHOICE TO BE THE CHIEF ELECTIONS OFFICIAL IN CALIFORNIA DURING THESE TRYING TIMES. AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT DR WEBER'S APPOINTMENT TO THE POSITION OF SECRETARY OF STATE. THANK YOU MR BERMAN. SEEING AND HEARING NO FURTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION MISTER SPEAKER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER MEMBERS COLLEAGUES I RISE TO CALL FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF OUR RESPECTED COLLEAGUE DR SHIRLEY WEBER AS CALIFORNIA'S SECRETARY OF STATE. MANY OF US HAVE WITNESSED THIS CONFIRMATION PROCESS BEFORE. FOUR YEARS AGO ATTORNEY GENERAL CUT CALMLY HARRIS BECAME SENATOR KAMILLA HARRIS. AND WE CONFIRM HAVE YOU EVER SERRA TO TAKE HER PLACE. TODAY HOWEVER IS ABOUT DR WEBER. A LITTLE WHILE AGO I CALLED HER A RESPECTED COLLEAGUE- BUT THAT IS NOT SUFFICIENT SHIRLEY WEBER HAS BECOME THE NEAR LEGENDARY FIGURE IN THE ASSEMBLY SHE IS MORE THAN A LEGISLATOR SHE IS A MORAL GIANT. SHE REPRESENTS MORE THAN ASSEMBLY DISTRICT SEVENTY NINE SHE REPRESENTS EVERY CALIFORNIAN WHO HAS LEFT WHO HAS FELT THE HEEL OF SYSTEMIC OPPRESSION SHE IS MORE THAN AN ASSEMBLY COLLEAGUE SHE IS A MENTOR A ROLE MODEL AND A GUIDING LIGHT SHINING FAR BEYOND. CALIFORNIA WHEN THEY HAVE POLICY DISAGREEMENTS WITH SHIRLEY WEBER BUT I FIND FEW WHO HAVE EVER SAID ANYTHING BAD ABOUT HER. HER MOCKED HER HALLMARK IS TENACITY ON TRULY RIGHTEOUS ISSUES. WE SAW HER LEADERSHIP ON THE REPEAL OF PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE AND WE WILL NEED TO CONTINUE THAT FIGHT. WE SAW HER LEADING US TOWARD PROGRESS ON RACIAL JUSTICE ON JURIES AND REPARATIONS AND WE NEED TO KEEP FIGHTING THERE. WE ALSO NEED TO HONOR HER WORK ON POLICE USE OF FORCE STANDARDS BY CONTINUING THE FIGHT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY REFORM. SHE BELIEVES NO SHE KNOWS THAT HER GOALS CAN BE ACHIEVED BECAUSE THEY MUST BE ACHIEVED. THAT IS THE ARC OF HISTORY. AND HER LIFE'S WORK HAS BEEN TO BAND THAT ARE. IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. ON THIS FLOOR WORK WHERE DEBATE IS OFTEN JUST A MATTER OF STAKING A POSITION. WE HAVE SEEN THE ELOQUENCE AND EXPERIENCE OF DR WEBER CHANGE MINDS. AND I BELIEVE I SAW HER DO THAT ON. SENDING PROPOSITION TWO OH NINE TWO TO REPEAT AS TO ANY PROPOSITION TO A NINE REPEAL TO VOTERS. DR WEBER'S VOICES STRONG BUT IS THE WORD SHE CHOOSES THAT HAVE THE IMPACT. HER WORDS KEEP US ALERT THEY KEEP US ENTERTAINED. AND THEY KEEP US INSPIRED. WE WILL MISS ALL OF THAT. NEVER THE LESS WE KNOW SECRETARY OF STATE SHIRLEY WEBER WILL FOCUS ON VOTING RIGHTS AND MAKING SURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS THROUGH THE BALLOT BOX. THAT WOULD BE TRUE EVEN AS THE BALLOT BOX CHANGES IN THE AGE OF VOTE BY MAIL ONLINE REGISTRATION AND DIGITAL PROGRESS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE.

MADAM SPEAKER AND MY COLLEAGUES AND MY FRIENDS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. IT HAS BEEN MY HONOR TO BE ON THIS FLOOR. SOME OF YOU KNOW EIGHT OR NINE YEARS AGO. I HAD NO REASON TO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS COMING OTHER THAN A FRIEND PUSH ME INTO RUNNING FOR THE ASSEMBLY. AND I THOUGHT I HAD FINISHED MY WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY. BUT I'VE DONE ALL I COULD FOR SO MANY STUDENTS THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS. AT SAN DIEGO STATE AND AROUND THE WORLD AND I FELT I NEEDED A VACATION. OF BUT SUCH WAS NOT TO BE THE CASE. AND SO I CAME WONDERING WHY AM I HERE. AND IT WAS INTERESTING BECAUSE A PERSON PUSH ME TONI ATKINS SOME YEARS AGO. WHISPERED IN MY EAR AS WE WERE PASSING THREE NINE TWO. THIS IS WHY YOU ARE HERE. I DON'T THINK MY FAMILY WHO CAME WITH ME TODAY BY HARD TO MY PROB. MY SON. SOMEWHERE UP THERE AND MY DAUGHTER AKELA MY SON TO KILL IN A KILLER WITH ME AS WELL AS ONE OF MY FAVORITE NEPHEWS DYNASTS JUNIOR. THEY CAME TODAY TO WITNESS ON BEHALF OF MY LARGE FAMILY. THE SEVEN OF US THAT ARE STILL ALIVE THE CHILDREN WILL PROBABLY ALL WATCHING ON TELEVISION. AND I'VE BEEN BLESSED TO HAVE A FAMILY THAT HAS NEVER HAD SIBLING RIVALRY. WE'VE NEVER HAD A FIGHT AGAINST EACH OTHER IN TERMS OF WORKING AGAINST EACH OTHER. AND THEY ARE PROUD OF ME THAT I COULD EVER BE OF MYSELF. THEY CHEER ME ON AND THEY GIVE ME STRENGTH. YEAH THIS IS A BEEN A- A JOURNEY FOR ME AND WHEN I REFLECT BACK ON MY YEARS OF LIFE. AND WHERE I BEGAN SOME OF YOU MENTIONED. WE WERE SHARECROPPERS IN HOPE ARKANSAS. WE OWN THE LAND BUT RACISM DEMANDED THAT MY FATHER AND HIS BROTHERS WORK THE WHITE MAN'S PROPERTY FIRST BEFORE THEY COULD EVER WORK THEIR OWN OR EVEN HARVEST THEIR CROP. WHAT AN UNFAIR AND UNJUST SYSTEM. AND MY FATHER WAS ONE WHO ALWAYS STOOD UP FOR WHAT WAS RIGHT. HE WAS HE WAS ALWAYS CONCERNED THAT HE HAD TO HAVE DIGNITY. AND SO HE FOUGHT BACK AT THE WAY STATION IN AUGUST OF NINETEEN FIFTY ONE. FOUGHT BACK. AND THEY HAD DETERMINED THAT HE WAS TOO DANGEROUS TO BE AROUND EVERYBODY ELSE SO THEY WERE GOING TO KILL HIM. AND SO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. WAS PUT IN THE BACK OF THE WAGON. AND TAKEN FROM HOPE ARKANSAS THE TEXARKANA. AND PUT ON A TRAIN TO COME TO CALIFORNIA WHERE MY MOTHER'S MOTHER HAD COME YEARS BEFORE. HE COULD BARELY READ. BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO GO TO SCHOOL BEYOND THE FIFTH GRADE. HE WAS IN A ONE ROOM SCHOOL HOUSE. AND WE LIVE IN A ONE ROOM HOUSE. HAD NO RUNNING WATER. A CLAPBOARD HOUSE IN HOPE ARKANSAS. AND SO MY FATHER CAME TO CALIFORNIA DETERMINES TO BRING HIS CHILDREN TO A GREAT A LAND OF OPPORTUNITY. UNTIL FOUR MONTHS LATER WE ALL GOT ON A TRAIN. IN HOPE ARKANSAS WE FLAT ALSO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT BECAUSE THEY WOULD HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY DEBT THAT ANYBODY HAD. WE CAME TO CALIFORNIA. IN NINETEEN FIFTY ONE. I WAS THE BABY OF THE FAMILY. I DON'T REMEMBER ALL THE RIDES WITH MY SISTERS AND BROTHERS OF TOLD ME ABOUT IT. AND SO WE CAME TO CALIFORNIA EVENTUALLY WHO LIVED IN THE PROJECTS THE PUEBLOS ARE BEING BUILT THOSE OF YOU WHO LIVE IN LOS ANGELES. AND WE LIVE IN THE PROBLEMS. AND MY FATHER WORKED VERY HARD. FOR ALL OF US BUT HE ALWAYS TOLD US SOME THINGS THAT WERE VERY IMPORTANT. ONE THAT WE MUST GET IN EDUCATION BECAUSE HE WAS DENIED. AND HE SAID IF YOU GET AN EDUCATION THAT IS THE ONE THING IN THIS WORLD THAT THAT THE RACISM COULD NOT TAKE FROM YOU. YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE THAT TO BASICALLY FASTEN YOUR LIFE. AND THE SECOND THING HE SAID AS HE WAS ALWAYS VOTE. YOU MUST ALWAYS VOTE BECAUSE HE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO VOTE IN HOPE ARKANSAS. AND MY GRANDPARENTS MY PUT A PATERNAL GRANDPARENTS IN ARKANSAS. NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO VOTE IN THEIR INTOLERANCE. BECAUSE THEY DIED BEFORE NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. AND SO THAT BECAME A PART OF OUR MANTRA IN HER FAMILY. WE MUST VOTE WE MUST GO TO SCHOOL. AND WE MUST MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND I AM SO PROUD OF WHAT MY FATHER DID FOR ME EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. AND HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE GLORIES OF CALIFORNIA. HARD WORKING JOBS MAKING ENDS MEET. SENDING HIS KIDS TO SCHOOL. MAKING SURE HIS ONE DAUGHTER WHO REALLY WANTED IN EDUCATION AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL GOT IT. SO WHEN I SAID TO HIM DADDY THEY WANT ME TO GET A PHD. THE QUESTION WAS WHAT IS THE ACT. AND I SAID WELL IT'S A LOT MORE SCHOOLING BUT IT'S A HIGHEST DEGREE YOU CAN GET. HIS RESPONSE WAS LET US GO GET IT. WHICH MEANT HE WOULD BE WITH ME EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. AND SO I STAND BEFORE YOU AS A CHILD OF A- SHARECROPPING FAMILY LIVING IN A COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE CARED SO DEEPLY FOR THEIR CHILDREN. GOING TO A CHURCH THAT FOLLOWED ME EVERY STEP OF THE WAY AND MANY OF THEM ARE LOOKING AT THIS RIGHT NOW THE FEDERAL CHURCH OF CHRIST. BECAUSE THEY PRAY FOR ME THEY BELIEVE IN ME. AND I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS OF OLD ALWAYS TALK TO WHOM MUCH IS GIVEN MUCH IS REQUIRED. AND THAT I HAD TO BASICALLY DO THE HARD WORK TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. AND SO WHEN I CAME HERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT MY TO DO THIS WAS IT. AND SO I HAD NO AND I HAVE EVERY INTENTIONS OF RETIRING FROM THIS BODIES. IN THREE AND A HALF MORE YEARS. AND MOVING ON TO GRANDPARENTS WHO WERE I COULD PLAY WITH MY GRANDKIDS AND DO THOSE KINDS OF FUN THINGS. AND WHEN I WAS TAPPED ON THE SHOULDER TO CONSIDER SECRETARY OF STATE. LIKE MOST OF YOU I WAS SHOCKED. I KNOW BUT NO AND I HAD NOT THOUGHT THAT PEOPLE WERE WATCHING. THINK WHY WAS. BELIEVING THAT I COULD DO THINGS THAT SOMETIMES I DIDN'T KNOW I COULD. AND SO AS A RESULT OF THAT. A MUCH HARD THINKING AND LONG THOUGHT I AGREE TO DO THE TEST. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WORK. WHEN A CRISIS RIGHT NOW IN THIS NATION. OUR DEMOCRACY IS SO FRAGILE AND PEOPLE HAVE SUCH MISINFORMATION. AND THE GREATNESS OF THIS NATION THAT WE HAVE TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED FOR SO LONG IS NOW BEING CHALLENGED. CAN WE SURVIVE IT CAN WE REALLY GET BACK TO THE PRINCIPLES WHERE EVERYONE IS AN IMPORTANT AND EVERY VOTE COUNTS AND EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO BE HEARD BUT NOT TO BE HEARD. AND WE HAVE A CHALLENGE TO DO THAT. AND NO MATTER WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST THAT IS OUR MISSION AT THIS POINT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS SMART DEMOCRACY SURVIVES. I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH FEAR IN ELECTIONS AS I'VE SEEN THIS PAST YEAR. AND I'VE BEEN AROUND THE WORLD AND I'VE SEEN COUNTRIES WITH CAN READ HAVE A LEXINGTON EVERYBODY IS NERVOUS. EVERYBODY'S CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND NOW THAT HAS COME TO US. AND WE REALIZE THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY OF THE LEGISLATURE. AND AS CITIZENS OF THE STATE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF EVERYONE TO VOTE. AND THAT EVERY VOTE COUNTS. AND THAT OUR SYSTEM ACTUALLY WORKS. AND THEN WE CAN BASICALLY BILL FOR THE FIRST TIME. A STATE THAT IS MULTICULTURAL WHERE EVERYONE WORKS TOGETHER AND EVERYONE IS RESPECTED. THAT WOULD BE UNIQUE. THAT WOULD BE A CHALLENGE. BUT IT'S ALSO A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY THE MISSION THAT WE HAVE. SO I WANT TO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR BLESSINGS YOU HAVE BLESSED ME SO MUCH. WITH YOUR FRIENDSHIP. WITH YOUR WILLINGNESS TO LISTEN TO ME. UNDERSTANDING OF MY PASSION AND MY DRIVE FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY FOR EVERYONE. AND IT COMES OUT OF THE FACT THAT I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE. WHEN THE WORLD IS NOT FAIR. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU ARE DISCOUNTED. I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO CLIMB A HILL THAT HIGHER THAN ANYBODY ELSE. AND PEOPLE STILL SEE YOU IS BARELY GETTING UP TO MOVE. I HAVE SEEN THAT I HAVE LIVED THAT. AND I'VE HAD THE OBSTACLE OF ME. AND ALL I WANT TO DO IS MAKE IT EASY FOR MY GRANDKIDS TO BE LIVE IN THE STATE. AND KNOW THAT THEIR EFFORTS WILL COUNT. THE KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE VALUED. AND KNOW THAT THEY WILL HAVE A CHANCE AT HAVING A LIFE. AS A RESULT OF HARD WORK THAT IT WILL MATTER IN THE END WHAT THEY'RE DOING. SO I THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME. AND HELP IT WILL IN LIST AND YOU THE IDEA THAT ALL OF US. NOT JUST SOME OF US NOT UST A FEW OF US. BUT EVERY LAST PERSON IN THIS HOUSE. HAS A UNIQUE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THIS STATE. AND THIS NATION SURVIVE. BUT WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO. OPEN OUR MOUTHS AND OPEN OUR HEARTS AGAINST INACCURACIES AND TO TRUST OURSELVES FORWARD. BECAUSE WE ARE IN A CRISIS OF LEADERSHIP. AND WE CANNOT STAND UP WHAT WE KNOW IS TRUE. THEN WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TWO WEEKS AGO WILL CONTINUE TO ROLL ACROSS THIS NATION. AND WE WILL BE THE WORSE FOR IT NOT THE BETTER FOR BEING SILENT. KING OFTEN SAID IS NOT TO PUT THE WORDS OF MY ENEMY SAY. IS THE SILENCE OF MY FRIENDS. A WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT UNIQUE RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE HAVE. I'VE ALWAYS LIVE WITH THE REALITY THAT IF I DON'T DO SOMETHING NO ONE ELSE WILL. AND THAT I WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR NOT HAVING DONE WHAT I CAN. I WANT TO DISCLOSE WITH THE THINGS THAT I'VE SAID ON THIS FLOOR EIGHT YEARS AGO. THAT IS A BIT OF THE SPEAKER PROGRESS USED TO QUOTE. AS I SAID SO OFTEN. THE JUSTICE. QUALITY ALL THOSE GOOD THINGS WE BELIEVE IN DEMOCRACY OR RARE FLOWERS RARE FLOWERS WOULD HAVE TO BE NURTURED AND WATERED AND CARED FOR. HATRED DISCRIMINATION. ALL THOSE THINGS WE DON'T WANT. THERE ARE WEEKS AND THEY GROW BEST IN THE COLLECT. AND AS WE LOOK AT THIS ISSUE WE REALIZE THAT THIS IS A JOURNEY OF A LIFE IF YOU WOULD NOT LEAVE THIS WORLD. EVENTS SAY WE HAVE DONE IT ALL BUT YOU WILL LEAVE BASICALLY KNOWING THAT YOU HAVE DONE THE BEST YOU COULD BECAUSE THE WORK CONTINUES FOR ALL OF OUR LIVES AND IF YOU THINK YOU'RE TIRED. YOU THINK IT'S NOT WORTH IT JUST LOOK AROUND AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE'RE SCIENCE WE REFUSE TO DO THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT. I'M EXCITED ABOUT GOING TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE NOW WASN'T INITIALLY BUT I AM NOW AS I LOOK AT THE TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY. THAT I WILL HAVE TO RAISE THESE ISSUES ARE IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN HAS A VOTE. AND AS I TELL PEOPLE HOW IRONIC IT IS THAT A GIRL WHOSE FATHER COULD NOT VOTE WHOSE GRANDPARENTS NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO VOTE. IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH. THANK YOU DR RUBBER FOR LEAVING US WITH THOSE INCREDIBLE WORDS.
