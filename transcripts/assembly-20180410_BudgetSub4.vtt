00:56:36.292 --> 00:56:38.094 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOOD ON THE TABLE PAY DOWN DEBT.

00:56:38.161 --> 00:56:39.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND EVEN IN SOME CASES PAY FOR

00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:41.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EMERGENCY EXPENSES LIKE FIXING

00:56:41.631 --> 00:56:43.133 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THEIR CAR.

00:56:43.199 --> 00:56:45.268 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE OUR STATE EITC BUILDS ON

00:56:45.335 --> 00:56:47.437 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE FEDERAL EITC AND THE FEDERAL

00:56:47.504 --> 00:56:49.572 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
CHILD TAX CREDIT. THESE THREE

00:56:49.639 --> 00:56:51.074 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
CREDITS COMBINED CAN NEARLY

00:56:51.141 --> 00:56:52.976 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
DOUBLE THE INCOME OF A FAMILY

00:56:53.042 --> 00:56:54.644 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WITH THREE OR MORE CHILDREN. AND

00:56:54.711 --> 00:56:55.478 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
YOU CAN SEE THIS FROM THE FIRST

00:56:55.545 --> 00:56:57.180 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
CHART AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE ONE

00:56:57.247 --> 00:56:58.815 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
OF MY HANDOUT.

00:56:58.882 --> 00:57:00.216 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THESE FAMILIES CONCEALER INCOMES

00:57:00.283 --> 00:57:01.785 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
RISE BY AS MUCH AS NINETY TWO

00:57:01.851 --> 00:57:03.052 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
PERCENT THANKS TO THESE THREE

00:57:03.119 --> 00:57:04.921 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
CREDITS.

00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:06.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FAMILIES WITH FEWER CHILDREN CAN

00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:07.423 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
ALSO SEE THEIR INCOMES RISE

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:09.192 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
SIGNIFICANTLY ALTHOUGH BY A

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:10.693 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SOMEWHAT SMALLER PERCENTAGE AND

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.262 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT'S BECAUSE SMALLER FAMILIES

00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:14.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
QUALIFY FOR SMALLER CREDITS.

00:57:14.564 --> 00:57:16.065 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE KELLY ATC

00:57:16.132 --> 00:57:17.333 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
HAS OVERWHELMINGLY BENEFITTED

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:19.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHILDREN AS YOU CAN SEE FROM THE

00:57:19.569 --> 00:57:20.837 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
CHART AT THE TOP OF PAGE TWO OF

00:57:20.904 --> 00:57:22.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
MY HAND OUT.

00:57:22.872 --> 00:57:23.907 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
MORE THAN NINETY PERCENT OF

00:57:23.973 --> 00:57:26.075 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KELLY A TO SEE DOLLARS WENT TO

00:57:26.142 --> 00:57:28.144 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN IN TWENTY

00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:29.646 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
FIFTEEN AND. AND THIS IS

00:57:29.712 --> 00:57:32.115 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IMPORTANT BECAUSE RESEARCH FINDS

00:57:32.182 --> 00:57:33.483 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT BOOSTING FAMILIES INCOMES

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:35.485 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CAN HELP TO REDUCE THE HARMFUL

00:57:35.552 --> 00:57:37.187 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
LONG TERM EFFECTS OF GROWING UP

00:57:37.253 --> 00:57:39.289 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:28%
IN POVERTY.

00:57:39.355 --> 00:57:40.924 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE COUNTY TO SEE ALSO LARGELY

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:42.792 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
BENEFITS WORKING MOTHERS AS YOU

00:57:42.859 --> 00:57:44.060 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
CAN SEE FROM THE CHART AT THE

00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:45.762 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:48%
BOTTOM OF PAGE TWO.

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:47.797 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WOMEN MAKE UP SEVENTY PERCENT OF

00:57:47.864 --> 00:57:49.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TAX FILERS WITH CHILDREN WHO ARE

00:57:49.699 --> 00:57:51.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ELIGIBLE FOR THE COUNTY EIGHTY

00:57:51.134 --> 00:57:52.936 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
SEE. SO THIS CREDIT IS AN

00:57:53.002 --> 00:57:54.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
IMPORTANT TOOL FOR WORKING

00:57:54.204 --> 00:57:55.605 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
MOTHERS WHO TEND TO EARN LESS

00:57:55.672 --> 00:57:57.073 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAN MEN AND WHO ARE MUCH MORE

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:58.842 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LIKELY TO BE SUPPORTING CHILDREN

00:57:58.908 --> 00:58:00.543 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:33%
ON THEIR OWN.

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:02.278 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND FINALLY THE TABLES ON PAGE

00:58:02.345 --> 00:58:04.047 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THREE OF MY HAND OUT SHOW THOUGH

00:58:04.113 --> 00:58:05.715 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THE CLAIMS DATA FOR THE KELLY A

00:58:05.782 --> 00:58:08.084 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
T. C. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS.

00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:09.285 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THE FIGURES HIGHLIGHTED IN

00:58:09.352 --> 00:58:11.354 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
RED SO THAT AROUND THREE HUNDRED

00:58:11.421 --> 00:58:13.356 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
AND SEVENTY THOUSAND TAX FILERS

00:58:13.423 --> 00:58:14.858 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
BENEFITTED FROM THE COUNTY TO

00:58:14.924 --> 00:58:17.260 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SEE. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND

00:58:17.327 --> 00:58:18.661 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACTUALLY MANY MORE PEOPLE HAVE

00:58:18.728 --> 00:58:19.762 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BENEFITTED FROM THE CREDIT

00:58:19.829 --> 00:58:21.130 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE THE TAX FILER CAN BE A

00:58:21.197 --> 00:58:22.699 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MARRIED COUPLE OR CAN BE A

00:58:22.765 --> 00:58:23.967 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
PARENT WITH CHILDREN IT'S

00:58:24.033 --> 00:58:25.702 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BASICALLY EVERYONE LISTED ON THE

00:58:25.768 --> 00:58:27.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
TAX FOR.

00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:29.138 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
I THIS YEAR THE KELLY ATC HAS

00:58:29.205 --> 00:58:30.707 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
REACHED FAR MORE TAX FILERS

00:58:30.773 --> 00:58:32.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ALMOST EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND AS

00:58:32.976 --> 00:58:34.210 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OF MARK MID MARCH OF THIS YEAR

00:58:34.277 --> 00:58:35.678 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
ABOUT A MONTH BEFORE THE END OF

00:58:35.745 --> 00:58:37.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
TAX FILING SEASON.

00:58:37.313 --> 00:58:38.781 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I AND THAT'S BECAUSE LAST YEAR'S

00:58:38.848 --> 00:58:40.316 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
BUDGET EXTENDED THE CREDIT TO

00:58:40.383 --> 00:58:42.151 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
MANY. MANY MORE PEOPLE OF.

00:58:42.218 --> 00:58:43.853 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
THIS MEANS THE DATA ARE

00:58:43.920 --> 00:58:45.455 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACTUALLY NOT COMPARABLE FOR THIS

00:58:45.521 --> 00:58:46.823 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
YEAR THAT WE HAVE SO FAR TO THE

00:58:46.890 --> 00:58:48.258 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PRIOR YEARS BECAUSE OF THE

00:58:48.324 --> 00:58:49.859 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
EXPANSION OF THE CREDIT.

00:58:49.926 --> 00:58:51.060 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND SO WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING A

00:58:51.127 --> 00:58:52.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LOWER AVERAGE CREDIT SO FAR THIS

00:58:52.996 --> 00:58:54.497 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YEAR AND THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE

00:58:54.564 --> 00:58:55.798 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
BECAME NEWLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE

00:58:55.865 --> 00:58:57.767 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CREDIT THIS YEAR TEND TO QUALIFY

00:58:57.834 --> 00:58:59.936 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
FOR SMALLER CREDITS.

00:59:00.003 --> 00:59:01.204 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
I SO SPECIFICALLY LAST YEAR'S

00:59:01.271 --> 00:59:03.172 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
EXPANSION OF THE KELLY ATC

00:59:03.239 --> 00:59:04.574 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
EXTENDED THE CREDIT TO SELF

00:59:04.641 --> 00:59:06.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EMPLOYED WORKERS AND THIS HELPED

00:59:06.643 --> 00:59:07.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO BRING OUR STATE CREDIT INTO

00:59:08.044 --> 00:59:08.878 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ALIGNMENT WITH THE FEDERAL

00:59:08.945 --> 00:59:09.812 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
CREDIT WHICH HAS ALWAYS

00:59:09.879 --> 00:59:11.314 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
PERMITTED SELF EMPLOYED WORKERS

00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:14.150 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TO QUALIFY. AND THAT SO FAR THIS

00:59:14.217 --> 00:59:14.717 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
YEAR BE WE'VE SEEN ABOUT A

00:59:14.784 --> 00:59:16.920 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND

00:59:16.986 --> 00:59:19.088 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CLAIMS FROM THE SELF EMPLOYED.

00:59:19.155 --> 00:59:20.790 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AT LAST YEAR'S EXPANSION ALSO

00:59:20.857 --> 00:59:22.325 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EXTENDED THE COUNTY EIGHTY SEE

00:59:22.392 --> 00:59:24.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO WORKERS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER

00:59:24.193 --> 00:59:25.628 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
UP THE INCOME SCALE.

00:59:25.695 --> 00:59:27.630 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO PREVIOUSLY PARENTS HAD EARNED

00:59:27.697 --> 00:59:29.632 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LESS THAN ABOUT AYE TEN THOUSAND

00:59:29.699 --> 00:59:31.000 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A

00:59:31.067 --> 00:59:32.902 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
YEAR TO QUALIFY FOR THE CREDIT.

00:59:32.969 --> 00:59:34.270 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
NOW THEY CAN EARN UP TO ABOUT

00:59:34.337 --> 00:59:35.305 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TWENTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A

00:59:35.371 --> 00:59:36.472 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:13%
YEAR.

00:59:36.539 --> 00:59:37.807 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS

00:59:37.874 --> 00:59:39.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PARENTS WORKING FULL TIME OR

00:59:39.409 --> 00:59:40.610 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
CLOSE TO FULL TIME AT THE

00:59:40.677 --> 00:59:42.578 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MINIMUM WAGE CAN NOW BENEFIT

00:59:42.645 --> 00:59:43.880 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
FROM THE CREDIT. AND THAT'S

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:45.348 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
IMPORTANT BECAUSE IN MANY PARTS

00:59:45.415 --> 00:59:47.317 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
OF THE STATE A MINIMUM WAGE JOB

00:59:47.383 --> 00:59:50.687 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
ISN'T ENOUGH TO SUPPORT A
FAMILY.

00:59:50.753 --> 00:59:51.854 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
I FOR WORKERS WHO ARE NOT

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:53.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SUPPORTING CHILDREN THE INCOME

00:59:53.356 --> 00:59:54.524 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
NEEDED TO QUALIFY FOR THE KELLY

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:55.858 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EIGHTY SEE MORE THAN DOUBLED

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:57.126 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FROM JUST UNDER SEVEN THOUSAND

00:59:57.193 --> 00:59:59.262 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DOLLARS A YEAR. TO ABOUT FIFTEEN

00:59:59.329 --> 01:00:00.897 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:43%
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:02.231 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO I THINK THERE'S A STRONG CASE

01:00:02.298 --> 01:00:03.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
FOR CONTINUING TO STRENGTHEN

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:05.101 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:33%
MCCALLIE ITC.

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:06.302 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUR FIRST OF ALL EARNED INCOME

01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:08.972 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
TAX CREDITS ARE PROVEN POLICIES

01:00:09.038 --> 01:00:10.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE FEDERAL EITC HAS BEEN AROUND

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:12.709 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
FOR SEVERAL DECADES AND THE

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:14.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THIS CROWD

01:00:14.210 --> 01:00:14.978 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IT DOESN'T JUST HELP FAMILIES

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:17.113 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GET BY DAY TODAY. IT'S ALSO BEEN

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.348 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
LINKED TO IMPROVED HEALTH FOR

01:00:18.414 --> 01:00:20.483 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
MOTHERS AND BABIES AS WELL AS

01:00:20.550 --> 01:00:21.851 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
HIGHER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:23.553 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RATES AND COLLEGE COMPLETION

01:00:23.619 --> 01:00:25.221 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
RATES FOR CHILDREN. SO IT

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:27.023 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
APPEARS THAT THOSE CREDIT CAN

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:28.958 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
PROVIDE BENEFITS THAT LAST INTO

01:00:29.025 --> 01:00:30.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
THE NEXT GENERATION.

01:00:30.293 --> 01:00:31.494 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
I AND OF INCLUDED A SUMMARY OF

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:32.695 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THIS RESEARCH AT THE BACK OF MY

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:35.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HAND OUT FOR YOUR REFERENCE.

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:37.133 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
I ALSO I THINK THAT WE NEED

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.167 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
POLICIES LIKE A STRONG STEVIE

01:00:38.234 --> 01:00:40.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ITC BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE SIMPLY

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:41.671 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CAN'T COUNT ON THEIR JOBS TO

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:44.207 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
PROVIDE FINANCIAL SECURITY.

01:00:44.273 --> 01:00:45.708 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF FOR EXAMPLE WAGES HAVEN'T

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:47.343 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
KEPT UP WITH THE RISING COST OF

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:48.444 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
LIVING IN PARTICULARLY HIGH

01:00:48.511 --> 01:00:49.846 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
HOUSING COSTS.

01:00:49.912 --> 01:00:51.280 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SO EVEN WHEN OUR MINIMUM WAGE

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:53.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IT'S FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER HOUR IT

01:00:53.116 --> 01:00:54.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WILL BE ENOUGH FOR MANY FAMILIES

01:00:54.083 --> 01:00:55.618 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
TO GET BY.

01:00:55.685 --> 01:00:57.153 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I ON TOP OF THAT MANY PEOPLE

01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:59.655 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CAN'T FIND STABLE FULL TIME JOBS

01:00:59.722 --> 01:01:00.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO THEY HAVE TO PATCH TOGETHER

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:02.959 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
TEMPORARY JOBS OR CONTRACT WORK.

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:04.727 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OR THEY HAVE TO MAKE DO WITH

01:01:04.794 --> 01:01:05.962 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PART TIME HOURS ARE INCONSISTENT

01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:07.163 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
HOURS.

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:08.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO THAT MEANS THEIR EARNINGS ARE

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:10.333 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
JUST IN SUFFICIENT OTHER

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.035 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
UNPREDICTABLE AND THAT MAKES IT

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:12.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HARD FOR THEM TO STAY ON TOP

01:01:12.969 --> 01:01:15.004 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THEIR BILLS AND PUT ASIDE ANY

01:01:15.071 --> 01:01:16.639 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
SAVINGS FOR THE FUTURE.

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:17.740 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SO I THINK STRENGTHENING THE

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:19.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
COUNTY EIGHTY SEEWOULD FURTHER

01:01:19.242 --> 01:01:20.610 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INCREASE ECONOMIC SECURITY FOR

01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:22.512 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:38%
THESE FAMILIES.

01:01:22.578 --> 01:01:23.446 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
SO I WANT TO CONCLUDE BY

01:01:23.513 --> 01:01:24.547 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
HIGHLIGHTING A FEW WAYS YOU

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:26.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COULD CONSIDER TO FURTHER INVEST

01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:27.784 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:38%
IN THIS CREDIT.

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:29.452 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ONE OPTION IS TO ALLOW LOW

THE TRADITIONAL RETIREMENT AGE

01:01:53.976 --> 01:01:56.279 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
OUT OF FINANCIAL NECESSITY.

01:01:56.345 --> 01:01:57.413 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ANOTHER WAY YOU COULD STRENGTHEN

ELIGIBILITY FOR THE CREDIT AS A

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:05.655 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:33%
WOULD SIMPLY.

01:02:05.721 --> 01:02:07.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
REQUIRE RAISING THE INCOME

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:08.858 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:42.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
FIRST ESTABLISHED?

01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:44.412 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE FULL RETIREMENT AGE IS

01:29:44.479 --> 01:29:45.713 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CURRENTLY SIXTY SIX AND FOUR

REFLECT THE ECONOMIC REALITY OF

01:30:36.564 --> 01:30:37.565 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
MISTER CHAIR I I JUST HAVE A

01:30:37.632 --> 01:30:38.800 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
QUESTION DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHAT

01:30:38.866 --> 01:30:40.234 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE POLICY DECISION WAS TO NOT

01:30:40.301 --> 01:30:42.336 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INCLUDE LOW INCOME EIGHTEEN TO

01:30:42.403 --> 01:30:43.905 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TWENTY FOUR YEAR OLDS I MEAN

01:30:43.971 --> 01:30:46.007 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT'S. IT WHO I WORKED ON EITC

01:30:46.073 --> 01:30:48.376 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
LAST YEAR IN MY MIND IS BLOWING

01:30:48.442 --> 01:30:50.478 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
BECAUSE I REALLY I REALIZED IT

01:30:50.545 --> 01:30:50.812 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:33%
THERE'S THAT.

01:30:50.878 --> 01:30:52.313 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SOLUTION AND I JUST WONDERED IF

01:30:52.380 --> 01:30:53.748 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ANYBODY KNEW NUMBER ONE.

01:30:53.815 --> 01:30:54.615 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW THE

01:30:54.682 --> 01:30:55.483 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
RATIONALE AND KNOW THAT

01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:56.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ORIGINALLY WHEN THE CREDIT WAS

01:30:56.818 --> 01:30:58.319 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
CREATED IN THE MID SEVENTIES IT

01:30:58.386 --> 01:30:59.987 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WAS ONLY AVAILABLE TO FAMILIES

01:31:00.054 --> 01:31:01.122 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THE EARLY

01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:03.090 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NINETIES THAT IT WAS EXTENDED TO

01:31:03.157 --> 01:31:03.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WORKERS WHO ARE NOT SUPPORTING

01:31:03.791 --> 01:31:04.826 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:23%
CHILDREN.

01:31:04.892 --> 01:31:06.594 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO I BELIEVE THE AGE LIMIT WAS

01:31:06.661 --> 01:31:07.361 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
PART OF THAT DECISION BUT I I

01:31:07.428 --> 01:31:08.930 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ORIGINAL

01:31:08.996 --> 01:31:10.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
RATIONALE WAS.

01:31:10.164 --> 01:31:11.065 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:11.732 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:13%
THAT.

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:14.068 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IT CURRENTLY ARE ELIGIBILITY

01:31:14.135 --> 01:31:16.304 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SITS ON TOP OF THE FEDERAL EITC

01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:18.306 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AND THINGS WERE DIFFERENT THE

01:31:18.372 --> 01:31:19.440 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
SEVENTIES.

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:22.677 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
LATELY UM SO YOU KNOW BUT WE

01:31:22.743 --> 01:31:24.178 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DON'T NEED TO STAY WITHIN THAT

01:31:24.245 --> 01:31:26.347 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FEDERAL GUIDELINES YES SO THAT

01:31:26.414 --> 01:31:27.548 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE

01:31:27.615 --> 01:31:28.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
IS.

01:31:28.082 --> 01:31:29.750 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WHY DON'T WE MAKE THIS

01:31:29.817 --> 01:31:31.519 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AUTOMATIC I MEAN I UNDERSTAND

01:31:31.586 --> 01:31:33.187 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
ALL THIS ENERGY THAT'S GOING IN

01:31:33.254 --> 01:31:35.089 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
TO TEACH YOU KNOW? TEACHING AND

01:31:35.156 --> 01:31:36.891 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
TRAINING PEOPLE. OUT BUT I LOOK

01:31:36.958 --> 01:31:38.326 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AT THE MAP AND IT'S NONE OF IT'S

01:31:38.392 --> 01:31:39.861 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IN REALLY IN MY DISTRICT RACE

01:31:39.927 --> 01:31:41.395 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
BEEN HEAVILY. IN TERMS OF HEAVY

01:31:41.462 --> 01:31:43.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CONCENTRATION I KNOW THERE'S

01:31:43.164 --> 01:31:45.132 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SOME GREAT BY TO PROGRAMS IN MY

01:31:45.199 --> 01:31:47.068 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
LOCAL REGION I'VE VISITED AND

01:31:47.134 --> 01:31:47.635 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
VISITED THEM DURING THE TAX

01:31:47.702 --> 01:31:49.670 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SEASON. BUT IT IT JUST SEEMS

01:31:49.737 --> 01:31:51.539 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
COUNTER INTUITIVE TO ME TO

01:31:51.606 --> 01:31:53.040 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REQUIRE PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY ASK

01:31:53.107 --> 01:31:54.809 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
FOR MONEY THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED

01:31:54.876 --> 01:31:57.078 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO ANYWAY. AND IF WE JUST MADE

01:31:57.144 --> 01:31:58.579 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IT THE REVERSE WITH A PROCESS

01:31:58.646 --> 01:32:02.450 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WHERE AT THE END OF THE YEAR.

01:32:02.516 --> 01:32:02.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
FDB DETERMINES

01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:03.751 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
HERE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:05.486 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ELIGIBLE GET THEM A CHECK IT

01:32:05.553 --> 01:32:07.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WOULD SEEM TO ME TO BE

01:32:07.588 --> 01:32:10.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ADMINISTRATIVELY MUCH CLEANER.

01:32:10.091 --> 01:32:11.792 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AND WE'D REALLY GET THE MONEY TO

01:32:11.859 --> 01:32:13.928 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WHERE IT'S GOING TO DO THE MOST

01:32:13.995 --> 01:32:16.731 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOOD SO EMPTY AND ANY. I'M I'M

01:32:16.797 --> 01:32:18.366 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
INTERESTED IN THAT I GUESS IS MY

01:32:18.432 --> 01:32:19.200 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
POINT AND I KNOW IT'S GOING TO

01:32:19.267 --> 01:32:20.835 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
COST A LOT MORE BECAUSE IT JUST

01:32:20.902 --> 01:32:22.436 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
MEANS WE'RE PAYING PEOPLE WHO

01:32:22.503 --> 01:32:23.204 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WERE GIVING PEOPLE MONEY THEY'RE

01:32:23.271 --> 01:32:25.139 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
ENTITLED TO AND. SOMETIMES WE

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:26.540 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
TRY TO KEEP.

01:32:26.607 --> 01:32:28.476 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
FROM LETTING PEOPLE KNOW BUT TO

01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:29.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE EXTENT THAT WE REALLY NEED

01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:30.978 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO LET PEOPLE KNOW AND WE HAVE

01:32:31.045 --> 01:32:32.613 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SUCH AN INCOME GAP IN THE STATE

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.181 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
IT JUST SEEMS TO ME.

01:32:34.248 --> 01:32:35.783 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO MAE LOGICAL SENSE AND I

01:32:35.850 --> 01:32:37.385 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%

EVERY DOLLAR MAKES A HUGE

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:44.125 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
DIFFERENCE IN IN THE LIFE OF OUR

01:32:44.191 --> 01:32:45.993 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
FAMILY SINCE I'D LIKE TO FIGURE

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:46.627 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
OUT A WAY TO BE ABLE TO GET GET

01:32:46.694 --> 01:32:48.629 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THE MONEY.

01:32:48.696 --> 01:32:51.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
MR TO.

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:53.200 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
FIRST WHY ONE ECHO THE COMMENTS

01:32:53.267 --> 01:32:54.936 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
OF OUR COLLEAGUE WE WERE JUST

01:32:55.002 --> 01:32:56.137 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHATTING ABOUT WHY IT ISN'T MADE

01:32:56.203 --> 01:32:58.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AMERICAN. AND I TOLD HER SHE WAS

01:32:58.873 --> 01:33:00.007 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
INTERESTED AUTHORED A BILL IN

01:33:00.074 --> 01:33:00.541 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
THAT TO BE HAPPY TO JOINT

01:33:00.608 --> 01:33:02.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AUTHORED THAT BILL. ARM SO I

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:03.210 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
WOULD ASK THE COMMUNITY

01:33:03.277 --> 01:33:04.712 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ADVOCATES IF THIS IS SOMETHING

01:33:04.779 --> 01:33:06.113 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER.

01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:07.882 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
EITHER THIS YEAR IN THE

01:33:07.949 --> 01:33:08.582 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
DISCUSSION AROUND.

01:33:08.649 --> 01:33:11.218 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
EITC REFORMER OR OTHERS.

01:33:11.285 --> 01:33:12.553 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
AND I'VE BEEN A HUGE FAN OF THE

01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:13.955 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT SINCE

01:33:14.021 --> 01:33:15.523 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
MY COLLEGE DAYS AND.

01:33:15.589 --> 01:33:17.491 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IT'S BEEN NOW OVER TWENTY FIVE

01:33:17.558 --> 01:33:19.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YEARS OF OF OF KNOWING THAT THIS

01:33:19.894 --> 01:33:21.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IS LIKELY THE MOST EFFECTIVE

01:33:21.996 --> 01:33:23.931 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ANTI POVERTY. TAX POLICY THAT WE

01:33:23.998 --> 01:33:25.433 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
COULD POSSIBLY HAVE.

01:33:25.499 --> 01:33:28.336 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
AND WE KNOW IT IT IT LIST FOLKS

01:33:28.402 --> 01:33:28.903 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OUT OF POVERTY IT ENCOURAGES

01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:31.639 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WORK. AYE AND AT A TIME WHEN WE

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:33.507 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HAVE THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATE IN

01:33:33.574 --> 01:33:34.108 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE COUNTRY WITH LOCAL HOUSING

AND THE DEEPEST INEQUALITY IN

01:33:35.476 --> 01:33:37.545 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE COUNTRY ARM WE HAVE TO

01:33:37.611 --> 01:33:39.180 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
EXPAND IT SO I WANT TO JUST I

01:33:39.246 --> 01:33:39.947 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
KNOW THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL

01:33:40.014 --> 01:33:41.048 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
ITEM BUT. I'M CERTAINLY

01:33:41.115 --> 01:33:43.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

EXPANDING THIS AND ALL THE

01:33:48.155 --> 01:33:49.223 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DIRECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN.

01:33:49.290 --> 01:33:51.025 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

TYPICALLY FOR IMMIGRANT

01:33:53.794 --> 01:33:55.863 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
COMMUNITIES MY MY ONE QUESTION I

01:33:55.930 --> 01:33:57.498 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
HAD FOR ADVOCATES.

01:33:57.565 --> 01:33:59.467 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HAVE THERE BEEN STUDIES ON THE

01:33:59.533 --> 01:34:00.668 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
IMPACT OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX

01:34:00.735 --> 01:34:02.603 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%

OF GOVERNMENT.

01:34:05.873 --> 01:34:07.441 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WONDERING IF IF THERE HAVE BEEN

01:34:07.508 --> 01:34:09.543 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
STUDIES ON THAT TOPIC BECAUSE I

01:34:09.610 --> 01:34:11.812 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
BELIEVE. THAT MY GUESS IS FOR

01:34:11.879 --> 01:34:13.981 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
EVERY DOLLAR THAT WE SPEND ON

01:34:14.048 --> 01:34:15.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EARNING A TEXTURED OR SAVING

01:34:15.216 --> 01:34:16.984 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
FIFTY CENTS OR OTHERS. IN OTHER

01:34:17.051 --> 01:34:18.319 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AREAS BUT I WOULD LOVE TO BE

01:34:18.386 --> 01:34:21.255 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
ABLE TO QUOTE. NUMBERS ON THAT.

01:34:21.322 --> 01:34:22.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I CAN TIME AND SAY THAT I'VE

01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:23.924 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THE

01:34:23.991 --> 01:34:24.892 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EIGHTY SI AND I HAVEN'T COME

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:26.394 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ACROSS THE STUDY THAT'S LOOKED

01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:27.728 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AT THAT. I WOULD ASSUME THAT

01:34:27.795 --> 01:34:29.030 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
WOULD BE TRUE IN PARTICULAR

01:34:29.096 --> 01:34:30.364 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BECAUSE THERE'S A STRONG BODY OF

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:32.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RESEARCH SHOWING THAT THE EITC

01:34:32.733 --> 01:34:34.235 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
INCREASES EMPLOYMENT.

01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:36.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PROCLAIMING SINGLE MOTHERS WHO

01:34:36.070 --> 01:34:36.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
ARE.

01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:38.639 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THAT LARGEST BENEFICIARIES OF

01:34:38.706 --> 01:34:40.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE ACC SOARED ASSUME THAT WOULD

01:34:40.408 --> 01:34:41.709 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BE TRUE BUT I HAVEN'T COME

01:34:41.776 --> 01:34:42.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
ACROSS ANY RESEARCH.

01:34:43.044 --> 01:34:44.378 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

THERE.

01:46:40.527 --> 01:46:42.529 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THE THE FIRST COMMENT IN

01:46:42.596 --> 01:46:44.831 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
REGARDS TO THE ISSUE OF THE

NUMBER OF STAFF.

01:46:46.933 --> 01:46:48.735 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%

ALL OF US OF BOARD MEMBERS ARE

01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:51.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN AGREEMENT WITH THE ISSUE OF

01:46:51.104 --> 01:46:52.606 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EIGHT STAFF WE THINK WE CAN WORK

01:46:52.672 --> 01:46:53.840 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WITHIN THAT. I KNOW MEMBER

01:46:53.907 --> 01:46:54.908 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
HORTON HAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT

01:46:54.975 --> 01:46:56.443 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OPINION I THINK SOME OF YOU HAVE

01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:58.011 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
RECEIVED MEMBER HORTON'S.

01:46:58.078 --> 01:47:00.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CORRESPONDENTS IN REGARDS TO

01:47:00.313 --> 01:47:01.782 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT ALSO I THINK SOME DETAILED

01:47:01.848 --> 01:47:03.350 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
CORRESPONDS CITIES GIVEN IN

01:47:03.416 --> 01:47:04.417 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
REGARDS TO WHAT HE SEES A SOME

01:47:04.484 --> 01:47:06.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LEGAL CHALLENGES IN REGARDS TO

01:47:06.153 --> 01:47:08.021 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE ISSUE IN REGARDS TO UP.

01:47:08.088 --> 01:47:09.723 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES TO THE

01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:11.124 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
ELECTED OFFICE SO I THINK THOSE

01:47:11.191 --> 01:47:12.793 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ARE YOU GOT THOSE I'M SURE THOSE

01:47:12.859 --> 01:47:14.461 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF THE EFFORT FOR FOR DISCUSSION

01:47:14.528 --> 01:47:16.129 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING. THE

01:47:16.196 --> 01:47:17.097 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
EIGHT STAFF IS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:47:17.164 --> 01:47:18.532 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THINK WE CAN ACTUALLY WORK

01:47:18.598 --> 01:47:19.366 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
WITHIN.

01:47:19.432 --> 01:47:21.168 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
WHAT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

01:47:21.234 --> 01:47:23.003 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT IS THE NATURE THOUGH STAFF?

01:47:23.069 --> 01:47:24.437 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
ALL RIGHT NOW THE WAY THE STAFF

01:47:24.504 --> 01:47:26.173 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
LAYS OUT IS THAT WE HAVE TWELVE

01:47:26.239 --> 01:47:27.407 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
AND THAT WOULD BE.

01:47:27.474 --> 01:47:28.842 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
SIX THAT ARE EXEMPT AND SIX

01:47:28.909 --> 01:47:30.510 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT ARE CIVIL SERVICE UNDER THE

01:47:30.577 --> 01:47:32.179 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RECOMMENDATION THAT'S THERE IT

01:47:32.245 --> 01:47:34.414 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
GOES TO TWO ONE SIX.

01:47:34.481 --> 01:47:35.816 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE A HIGH IN

01:47:35.882 --> 01:47:37.784 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
REGARDS TO THE ISSUE OF TO

01:47:37.851 --> 01:47:40.620 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:68%
EXEMPT IS THE NATURE OF OUR
WORK.

01:47:40.687 --> 01:47:42.923 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AS ELECTED OFFICIALS I THINK

01:47:42.989 --> 01:47:44.191 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
IT'S VERY WE WE NEED SOME

01:47:44.257 --> 01:47:46.459 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
FLEXIBILITY AND I GET LITTLE GO

01:47:46.526 --> 01:47:47.727 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AGAIN THE ISSUE A FIFTY FIFTY

01:47:47.794 --> 01:47:49.029 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
SPLIT GIVES US SOME OF THAT

01:47:49.095 --> 01:47:51.398 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FLEXIBILITY RIGHT NOW. BUT THE

01:47:51.464 --> 01:47:52.966 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LIMIT US THEN TO TO I IN TERMS

01:47:53.033 --> 01:47:55.202 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THE EXEMPT STAFF ISSUES I THINK

01:47:55.268 --> 01:47:57.037 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CREATES AN ADDITIONAL ISSUES FOR

01:47:57.103 --> 01:47:58.572 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
US REGARD STOOD THAT LIMITS THAT

01:47:58.638 --> 01:48:00.574 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
ARE THERE. WHEN IT COMES TO

01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:01.541 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES

01:48:01.608 --> 01:48:03.176 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND THAT'S A CHALLENGE WOULD

01:48:03.243 --> 01:48:04.444 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LIKE TO CONTINUE TO TALK THROUGH

01:48:04.511 --> 01:48:06.413 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
A WE THINK THAT THAT AGAIN WE

01:48:06.479 --> 01:48:08.281 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CAN WORK WITHIN THE CONFINES AND

01:48:08.348 --> 01:48:09.649 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
BE APPROPRIATE REGARDS TO HOW

01:48:09.716 --> 01:48:11.418 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
STAFF ASSIGNMENTS ARE MADE.

01:48:11.484 --> 01:48:13.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU KNOW ONE SINCE I THINK AND

01:48:13.486 --> 01:48:14.788 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
I GUESS I COME BACK TO YOU AS A

01:48:14.855 --> 01:48:15.889 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
FORMER MEMBER BOTH IN THE

01:48:15.956 --> 01:48:17.490 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
LEGISLATURE IN THE IN THE SENATE

01:48:17.557 --> 01:48:19.326 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
AND THE ASSEMBLY. IN THAT I

01:48:19.392 --> 01:48:20.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINK PART OF THE ISSUE THAT'S

01:48:20.961 --> 01:48:21.895 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
UNIQUE IN THAT I HOPE YOU

01:48:21.962 --> 01:48:23.330 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
UNDERSTAND THAT IS WHEN YOU CAME

01:48:23.396 --> 01:48:24.497 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:43%
INTO YOUR OFFICE.

01:48:24.564 --> 01:48:25.999 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
YOU HAD BASICALLY CONTROL OF

01:48:26.066 --> 01:48:27.300 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
YOUR STAFF IN TERMS OF WHO THEY

01:48:27.367 --> 01:48:28.935 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WERE WHAT THEY WERE DOING AS YOU

01:48:29.002 --> 01:48:30.704 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOT ELECTED YOU MADE YOUR CHOICE

01:48:30.770 --> 01:48:32.072 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN THE NOW AND AND AND AND AND

01:48:32.138 --> 01:48:33.373 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
ASSIGNMENTS.

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:34.808 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT'S VERY THAT WE'RE IN THAT

01:48:34.875 --> 01:48:35.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SAME SENSE OF WERE ELECTED

01:48:35.408 --> 01:48:36.576 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
OFFICIALS.

01:48:36.643 --> 01:48:37.644 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AND SO THE START WITH ELECTED

01:48:37.711 --> 01:48:39.079 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OFFICIALS THAT ACTUALLY THAT

01:48:39.145 --> 01:48:41.014 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
HAVE TWO THIRDS OF OUR STAFF.

01:48:41.081 --> 01:48:42.816 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT HERB BETTER BY DESIGNATION

01:48:42.883 --> 01:48:44.084 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
CIVIL SERVANTS MEANS THAT

01:48:44.150 --> 01:48:45.585 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEY'RE ALREADY ASSIGNED TO YOU.

01:48:45.652 --> 01:48:47.420 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT TELL

01:48:47.487 --> 01:48:48.889 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

01:48:48.955 --> 01:48:49.923 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WITH OUR INTERVIEWS OR ANY OF

01:48:49.990 --> 01:48:51.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT PROCESS BUT YET THEY'RE

01:48:51.358 --> 01:48:52.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SERVING YOU THERE YOUR SECTION

01:48:52.359 --> 01:48:53.360 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
S. THERE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

WORKING IN YOUR OFFICE. IN MANY

01:48:55.028 --> 01:48:56.596 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
DIFFERENT HUESO AGAIN MORE

01:48:56.663 --> 01:48:58.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FLEXIBILITY I THINK IS IMPORTANT

01:48:58.098 --> 01:48:59.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE WE THINK THAT THE EIGHT IS

01:48:59.966 --> 01:49:01.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A GOOD NUMBER WE DISAGREE UP

01:49:01.368 --> 01:49:02.669 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
WITH WITH THE LA SHOWS.

01:49:02.736 --> 01:49:04.571 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
WORK WE'VE GIVEN MORE

01:49:04.638 --> 01:49:06.339 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
INFORMATION WE DIDN'T WE WE HAD

01:49:06.406 --> 01:49:08.341 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
NO CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ALEJO

01:49:08.408 --> 01:49:09.809 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:68%
AND I THINK NOW THE OFFICES
DEBT.

01:49:09.876 --> 01:49:10.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
WE HAVE GIVEN THEM THE

01:49:11.044 --> 01:49:12.178 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
INFORMATION THOUGH SINCE THEN

01:49:12.245 --> 01:49:13.513 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DIALOGUE

01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:15.649 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
WITH US ON ON THAT ISSUE.

01:49:15.715 --> 01:49:16.950 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:48%
IN IN REGARDS THAT.

01:49:17.017 --> 01:49:19.085 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE OTHER ISSUE I THINK THAT I

01:49:19.152 --> 01:49:20.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WANT TO SPEAK TO IN REGARDS TO

01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:21.788 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
THE SIZE OF STAFF.

01:49:21.855 --> 01:49:23.189 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHILE THE FOOTPRINT OF THE BE.

01:49:23.256 --> 01:49:24.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WE MET RESPONSIBILITY IS

01:49:24.858 --> 01:49:26.927 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
SMALLER NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT

01:49:26.993 --> 01:49:28.461 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE FACT IS THERE OTHER SERVICES

01:49:28.528 --> 01:49:29.696 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
TO WHICH WE NO LONGER HAVE

01:49:29.763 --> 01:49:29.996 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%

01:49:44.611 --> 01:49:46.212 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
ARRANGEMENTS FOR YOU.

01:49:46.279 --> 01:49:47.614 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%

01:49:48.949 --> 01:49:50.383 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:43%
AN OUTREACH THAT.

01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:51.751 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT WOULD TAKE CARE OF SOME OF

01:49:51.818 --> 01:49:52.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THOSE THINGS WE'RE DOING A

01:49:52.852 --> 01:49:54.754 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SEMINAR THOSE NO LONGER EXISTS

01:49:54.821 --> 01:49:55.989 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

01:49:56.056 --> 01:49:57.023 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
LEGISLATION THERE'S A BIG

FIREWALL PUT UP THERE.

01:49:58.325 --> 01:50:00.026 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

THE ABILITY TO DO THAT.

01:50:24.384 --> 01:50:26.252 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
IN FACT

01:50:26.319 --> 01:50:27.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT THE DEPARTMENTS HAVE TOLD

01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:28.588 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%

IN ORDER TO DO THAT ALL THIS IS

01:50:33.893 --> 01:50:35.462 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PUT MORE DEMAND ON US IN THOSE

01:50:35.528 --> 01:50:36.997 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AREAS NOT LAST SO I WON'T LAY

01:50:37.063 --> 01:50:38.732 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THOSE OUT THERE. THE OTHER ISSUE

01:50:38.798 --> 01:50:39.332 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO

01:50:39.399 --> 01:50:40.567 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:33%
REQUEST LIKE.

01:50:40.633 --> 01:50:41.067 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
AND THAT IS THE ISSUE OF

01:50:41.134 --> 01:50:42.335 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:28%
TRANSITION.

01:50:42.402 --> 01:50:44.137 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WE DO NOT AGREE WITH WHAT THE

01:50:44.204 --> 01:50:45.939 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THOUGHTS WERE IN REGARDS TO TO

01:50:46.006 --> 01:50:47.374 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
FINANCE IN REGARDS TO SOMEHOW

01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:48.441 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THE EIGHT WAS ALREADY DECIDED

01:50:48.508 --> 01:50:49.909 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
LAST YEAR.

01:50:49.976 --> 01:50:51.144 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
NOW WE BELIEVE AGAIN IN THE

01:50:51.211 --> 01:50:52.846 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
CONVERSATIONS THAT TOOK PLACE

01:50:52.912 --> 01:50:54.848 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT THE PURPOSE OF ASKING FANS

01:50:54.914 --> 01:50:56.483 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TO GIVE A REPORT THIS YEAR IN

01:50:56.549 --> 01:50:58.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
APRIL WAS IN ORDER TO MAKE THOSE

01:50:58.251 --> 01:50:59.786 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
DECISIONS THIS YEAR.

01:50:59.853 --> 01:51:01.154 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND SO WE THINK THIS IS AN

01:51:01.221 --> 01:51:02.522 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE WE THINK

01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:03.723 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
WHAT WE NEED TO DO NOW THAT

01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:05.425 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE'VE COME UP WITH THE NUMBER.

01:51:05.492 --> 01:51:06.593 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
THAT WE WE NEED TO DO IS

01:51:06.659 --> 01:51:07.160 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
TRANSITION THEN THROUGH THIS

01:51:07.227 --> 01:51:08.595 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:13%
YEAR.

01:51:08.661 --> 01:51:10.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE FACT IS THAT TAKING TWELVE

01:51:10.730 --> 01:51:11.865 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
PEOPLE ARE TAKING SELF HAPPENED

01:51:11.931 --> 01:51:13.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CUTTING THEM BY. TELLING FOR

01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:14.601 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THEM MEANS A SOME OF THOSE

01:51:14.667 --> 01:51:16.669 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PEOPLE BY BY BASICALLY THE

01:51:16.736 --> 01:51:18.138 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PASSING A BUDGET WILL LEAST LOSE

01:51:18.204 --> 01:51:19.339 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:28%
THEIR JOBS.

01:51:19.406 --> 01:51:20.840 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
IT'S INTERESTING TO SOME OF

01:51:20.907 --> 01:51:22.442 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THOSE PEOPLE INDEED COULD BE

01:51:22.509 --> 01:51:24.210 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
CIVIL SERVICE PEOPLE AND THAT'S

01:51:24.277 --> 01:51:24.778 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WHY I BROUGHT IT IT'S VERY

01:51:24.844 --> 01:51:25.979 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
UNIQUE IN OUR SITUATIONS THAT

01:51:26.046 --> 01:51:27.347 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:63%
MANY OF OUR CIVIL SERVICE
PEOPLE.

01:51:27.414 --> 01:51:29.015 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DON'T DON'T HAVE RETURN RIGHTS

01:51:29.082 --> 01:51:31.217 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
TO THE TAX AGENCIES.

01:51:31.284 --> 01:51:32.619 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AND SO WE HAVE CIVIL SERVICE

01:51:32.685 --> 01:51:33.253 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EMPLOYEES THAT BASICALLY HAVE.

01:51:33.319 --> 01:51:35.255 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
TURN RIGHTS.

01:51:35.321 --> 01:51:37.190 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE BILL WE MEMBERS OFFICE BUT

01:51:37.257 --> 01:51:38.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE POSITIONS HAVE BEEN CUT IN

01:51:38.291 --> 01:51:39.692 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE BE ALWAYS OUT MEMBERS OFFICE

01:51:39.759 --> 01:51:40.727 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SO THEY PERCEIVE THEY ARE CIVIL

01:51:40.794 --> 01:51:42.395 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SERVICE EMPLOYEES WITHOUT RETURN

01:51:42.462 --> 01:51:43.563 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
RIGHTS.

01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:45.165 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OUR AND WE THINK THAT THAT'S A

01:51:45.231 --> 01:51:46.633 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT'S A PROBLEM SO WE THINK

01:51:46.699 --> 01:51:48.802 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AGAIN TRANSITIONING MAKES SENSE.

01:51:48.868 --> 01:51:50.937 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
HELPING US THEN A THEN UP

MAKING THOSE ADJUSTMENTS THEN

FOR JANUARY FIRST MAKES A LOT OF

01:51:55.608 --> 01:51:57.243 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SENSE SO. THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS.

01:51:57.310 --> 01:51:59.145 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%

01:53:59.732 --> 01:54:01.301 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT THE DEAL

01:54:01.367 --> 01:54:01.534 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
WE SEE.

01:54:01.601 --> 01:54:03.036 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF WOULD

01:54:03.102 --> 01:54:04.637 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ABSORB THEM WITHIN THE BILL WE

01:54:04.704 --> 01:54:05.605 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:33%
ORGANIZATION.

01:54:05.672 --> 01:54:06.272 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO THEY NEVER LOSE A POSITION AT

01:54:06.339 --> 01:54:08.107 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:28%
THAT POINT.

01:54:08.174 --> 01:54:09.175 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEY ALWAYS THEN STAY WITHIN THE

01:54:09.242 --> 01:54:09.342 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
BE.

01:54:09.409 --> 01:54:10.510 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
WE THEY WOULD GO INTO

01:54:10.577 --> 01:54:12.412 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
HEADQUARTERS ARE GOING TO

01:54:12.478 --> 01:54:12.979 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DISTRICT OFFICE OR SOMEWHERE

01:54:13.046 --> 01:54:13.913 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
LIKE THAT.

01:54:13.980 --> 01:54:15.381 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AT THAT POINT THEN THERE WOULD

01:54:15.448 --> 01:54:17.283 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
BE A NEW SOLICITATION.

01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:19.352 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
FOR A CIVIL SERVICE POSITION TO

01:54:19.419 --> 01:54:20.887 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WHICH THEN THE BOARD MEMBERS NOR

01:54:20.954 --> 01:54:23.189 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
MEMBER WAS INVOLVED IN.

01:54:23.256 --> 01:54:25.058 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
NOW THE NEWER INTERPRETATION OF

01:54:25.124 --> 01:54:26.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WHAT'S TAKING PLACE AS I

01:54:26.359 --> 01:54:28.228 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNDERSTAND IT IS THAT THAT WAS

01:54:28.294 --> 01:54:29.662 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
NOT A PROPER PROCESS

01:54:29.729 --> 01:54:31.030 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AGAIN IT WAS JUST THE ONE THAT

01:54:31.097 --> 01:54:32.298 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THE PROCESS THAT WAS IN PLACE

01:54:32.365 --> 01:54:34.000 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
FOR AS FAR AS I KNOW FOREVER.

01:54:34.067 --> 01:54:35.902 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
NOW THE PROCESS TIAS FOR CIVIL

01:54:35.969 --> 01:54:37.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SERVANTS WHO ARE EXISTING IN A

01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:38.438 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CERTAIN IN A MEMBER'S OFFICE

01:54:38.504 --> 01:54:40.540 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
LIKE IN MINE. A NEW MEMBER MORE

01:54:40.607 --> 01:54:41.908 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
MEMBER COMES UP IN. THEY

01:54:41.975 --> 01:54:43.676 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BASICALLY HAVE THOSE CIVIL

01:54:43.743 --> 01:54:44.877 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:23%
SERVANTS.

01:54:44.944 --> 01:54:46.613 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE'S NO CHOICES AT THAT POINT

01:54:46.679 --> 01:54:48.681 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEY STAY IN THAT OFFICE YOU

01:54:48.748 --> 01:54:49.682 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO MOVE

01:54:49.749 --> 01:54:51.818 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:68%
THEM OR MAKE THEM OR ABSORB
THEM.

01:54:51.884 --> 01:54:53.086 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
QUITE FRANKLY IT'S A PRACTICAL

01:54:53.152 --> 01:54:54.387 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
ISSUE TO NOW WITH THE SMALLNESS

01:54:54.454 --> 01:54:55.355 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
OF THE VIEW WE THERE JUST NOT

01:54:55.421 --> 01:54:56.623 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THAT MANY PLACES TO PUT SOMEBODY

01:54:56.689 --> 01:54:58.358 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
RIGHT. SO THAT'S PART OF THE

01:54:58.424 --> 01:54:58.558 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:15%
ISSUE.

01:54:58.625 --> 01:54:59.392 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
AND AGAIN.

01:54:59.459 --> 01:55:00.493 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ONE THE ONE OF THE ON IT

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:02.228 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF LAST

01:55:02.295 --> 01:55:03.429 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
YEAR WAS AGAIN THIS ISSUE OF OF

01:55:03.496 --> 01:55:05.665 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
RETURN RIGHTS.

01:55:05.732 --> 01:55:06.666 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
WE'VE CIVIL SERVANTS WHO

01:55:06.733 --> 01:55:07.300 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
BASICALLY HAVE NO RETURN RIGHTS

01:55:07.367 --> 01:55:08.368 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
NOW.

01:55:08.434 --> 01:55:10.303 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND I DON'T AGREE WITH THE

01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:11.638 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
INTERPRETATION THAT HAS BEEN

01:55:11.704 --> 01:55:14.007 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
MADE BY SOME OF THE ARM THREE A

01:55:14.073 --> 01:55:15.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENTS IN

01:55:15.408 --> 01:55:16.576 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
REGARDS THE FACT SOME OF MY

01:55:16.643 --> 01:55:17.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
STAFF WHO ORIGINALLY WERE IT

01:55:17.977 --> 01:55:18.811 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
WOULD BE A WE. SHOULD HAVE

01:55:18.878 --> 01:55:20.246 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
RETURN RIGHTS BACK TO THE TAX

01:55:20.313 --> 01:55:22.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AGENCIES RIGHT NOW THEY DON'T.

01:55:22.548 --> 01:55:24.117 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
AND INTER IN AND SO AS A RESULT

01:55:24.183 --> 01:55:25.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
OF THAT IF THEY WERE TO LOSE

01:55:25.518 --> 01:55:26.986 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEIR POSITION. THEY BASICALLY

01:55:27.053 --> 01:55:28.755 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
END UP.

01:55:28.821 --> 01:55:30.657 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WITHOUT PROTECTION BUT THE SAME

01:55:30.723 --> 01:55:31.291 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THE EMPLOYEES IN THE CAPITAL TO

01:55:31.357 --> 01:55:33.092 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
THOUGH.

01:55:33.159 --> 01:55:34.127 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
RIGHT NOW YOU DON'T HAVE CIVIL

01:55:34.193 --> 01:55:35.028 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
SERVICE IN THE CAPITAL SEE

01:55:35.094 --> 01:55:36.529 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IT YOU'RE

01:55:36.596 --> 01:55:38.131 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
EXACTLY RIGHT A MISTER CHAIRMAN

01:55:38.197 --> 01:55:39.532 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS BUT

01:55:39.599 --> 01:55:40.900 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
YOUR PEOPLE ARE NOT PROTECTED

01:55:40.967 --> 01:55:42.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WITH CIVIL RIGHTS OR CIVIL CIVIL

01:55:42.535 --> 01:55:44.137 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SERVICE PROTECTION. WILL FOURTH

01:55:44.203 --> 01:55:46.839 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
OCCUR AT ITS DEBT PRIOR STATUS.

01:55:46.906 --> 01:55:49.375 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:43%
IN CIVIL SERVICE.

01:55:49.442 --> 01:55:50.543 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THEY COULD GO BACK GO BACK YES

01:55:50.610 --> 01:55:51.744 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BUT HERE'S THE PROBLEM THE

01:55:51.811 --> 01:55:53.279 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
PROBLEM IS IF SOMEBODY FOR

01:55:53.346 --> 01:55:53.946 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INSTANCE WITH SOME PEOPLE ON A

01:55:54.013 --> 01:55:55.715 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
BEEN IN OUR IN OUR OFFICES.

01:55:55.782 --> 01:55:56.749 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PRIOR TO ME THEY'VE BEEN THEY'VE

01:55:56.816 --> 01:55:58.518 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
BEEN IN MEMBERS OFFICES FOR

01:55:58.584 --> 01:56:00.787 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GOODNESS SAKE I THINK GO TO TO

01:56:00.853 --> 01:56:00.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:08%
TO.

01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:02.188 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:03%
.

01:56:02.255 --> 01:56:03.790 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN YEARS THEY

01:56:03.856 --> 01:56:04.691 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
NEVER WORKED WITHIN THE TAX

01:56:04.757 --> 01:56:06.759 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
AGENCY.

01:56:06.826 --> 01:56:07.293 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BUT THEY'VE BEEN A BILL WE

01:56:07.360 --> 01:56:08.661 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:23%
EMPLOYEE.

01:56:08.728 --> 01:56:10.096 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THEY JUST WORK IN OFFICE THEY

01:56:10.163 --> 01:56:12.265 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
HAVE NO PLACE TO RETURN TO THEN

01:56:12.332 --> 01:56:13.599 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
UNDER THIS UNDER THIS SCENARIO

01:56:13.666 --> 01:56:15.468 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SO AGAIN WE THINK IT CAN BE FOR.

01:56:15.535 --> 01:56:16.469 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS TO FIX

01:56:16.536 --> 01:56:17.737 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:40%
THAT NUMBER ONE.

01:56:17.804 --> 01:56:19.405 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IF YOU JUST GIVE RETURN RIGHTS

01:56:19.472 --> 01:56:21.240 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
TO TO BE A WE EMPLOYEES BACK TO

01:56:21.307 --> 01:56:22.475 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE TAX AGENCIES THAT WOULD

01:56:22.542 --> 01:56:24.811 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:48%
SOLVE THAT PROBLEM.

01:56:24.877 --> 01:56:26.279 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THE OTHER ISSUE IS AGAIN GIVE A

01:56:26.346 --> 01:56:27.914 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO THE

01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:29.716 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
INCOMING MEMBER BY TRADING OFF

01:56:29.782 --> 01:56:31.317 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:23%
AT LEAST.

01:56:31.384 --> 01:56:33.019 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YOU KNOW GOING FROM AT LEAST TWO

01:56:33.086 --> 01:56:34.187 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
TO FOUR AND THAT GIVES A LITTLE

01:56:34.253 --> 01:56:35.855 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
MORE FLEXIBILITY BUT STILL MEANS

01:56:35.922 --> 01:56:36.889 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT THE BOARD MEMBERS CAN HAVE

01:56:36.956 --> 01:56:38.024 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO KEEP SOME OF THE STAFF THAT

01:56:38.091 --> 01:56:39.292 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE COME INTO. AS THEY COME INTO

01:56:39.359 --> 01:56:42.628 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
OFFICE.

01:56:42.695 --> 01:56:43.496 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SO JUST JUST TO CLARIFY SO YOU

01:56:43.563 --> 01:56:44.831 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
SEE YOU.

01:56:44.897 --> 01:56:47.533 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU FEEL THAT THE YOU AND SOME

01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:48.534 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
OF THE OTHER MEMBERS NOT NOT ALL

01:56:48.601 --> 01:56:50.169 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
IN THE SAME ITEM. WOULD BE OPEN

01:56:50.236 --> 01:56:53.706 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
TO UP FOR EXEMPT AND FORCE OF.

01:56:53.773 --> 01:56:54.340 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT'S AN IMPROVEMENT OVER WHAT

01:56:54.407 --> 01:56:55.241 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:05%
IS

01:56:55.308 --> 01:56:56.376 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PRESENTED BEFORE US WITH THE

01:56:56.442 --> 01:56:58.111 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FINANCE WORK MANAGING GIVES US

01:56:58.177 --> 01:56:59.078 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY WE WOULD

01:56:59.145 --> 01:57:00.646 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
BELIEVE THAT SO SO YOU'RE NOT

01:57:00.713 --> 01:57:02.715 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
GONNA GET THE MORE FLEXIBILITY

01:57:02.782 --> 01:57:04.183 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE BETTER OF HIM I THINK I'VE

01:57:04.250 --> 01:57:05.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GOT SOME OTHER MEMBERS WOULD SAY

01:57:06.052 --> 01:57:06.652 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEY SHOULD ALL BE EXEMPT RIGHT.

01:57:06.719 --> 01:57:09.222 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BUT I THINK ANY MOVEMENT TOWARD.

01:57:09.288 --> 01:57:10.723 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
TOWARD AN ADDITIONAL NUMBER

01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:12.325 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
GIVES US MORE FLEXIBILITY

01:57:12.392 --> 01:57:13.826 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SO THE IDEAL SITUATION WOULD BE

01:57:13.893 --> 01:57:15.628 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
TO HAVE ALL A. B. EXAM VERY

01:57:15.695 --> 01:57:16.929 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
SIMILAR TO WHAT IT IS THAT YOU

01:57:16.996 --> 01:57:17.397 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
HAVE IN YOUR OFFICE.

01:57:17.463 --> 01:57:19.031 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:25%
THANK YOU.

01:57:19.098 --> 01:57:20.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND I JUST WOULD LIKE TO RAISE

01:57:20.533 --> 01:57:22.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ONE POINT COM FIRST FINANCES ARE

01:57:22.935 --> 01:57:24.203 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PROPOSALS NOT REDUCING THE CIVIL

01:57:24.270 --> 01:57:25.838 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
SERVICE STAFF AT ALL. AND

01:57:25.905 --> 01:57:26.539 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:23%
SECONDLY.

01:57:26.606 --> 01:57:28.341 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
IF FOR SOME REASON THE CIVIL

01:57:28.408 --> 01:57:30.176 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
SERVICE STAFF MEMBER REDUCED IF

01:57:30.243 --> 01:57:31.477 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
YOU'RE HIRED TO THE CIVIL

01:57:31.544 --> 01:57:32.545 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
SERVICE PROCESS SUPPORT

01:57:32.612 --> 01:57:34.247 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
EQUALIZATION AND SUBSEQUENTLY

01:57:34.313 --> 01:57:35.114 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
SIGNED A BOARD MEMBER.

TAKES TIME. JUST BECAUSE WE GET

02:02:12.425 --> 02:02:14.894 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
A CALL ON TAXES DOESN'T MEAN

WE'RE NOT GOING TO HELP OUR

BECAUSE I THINK I AGAIN I THINK

02:02:19.832 --> 02:02:20.900 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THE IDEA OF THE FIRST NARROW THE

SMALLER FOOTPRINT I AGREE WITH

02:02:22.168 --> 02:02:25.871 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE FACT IS. WE DON'T WE DON'T

THOSE AND QUITE FRANKLY WE BACK

02:02:36.148 --> 02:02:37.383 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
YOU GUYS UP IN THAT ISSUE TOO

DEALING WITH THOSE INDIVIDUALS

02:02:42.922 --> 02:02:44.724 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND SO THE IDEA OF ATTACKS

02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:45.324 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
COUNSEL.

THAT WE ALL SHARE AGAIN IF THE I

02:02:55.267 --> 02:02:56.635 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
WANNA GIVE YOU ONE MORE EXAMPLE

02:02:56.702 --> 02:02:57.970 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
ABOUT FOOTPRINT EVEN OUR

02:02:58.037 --> 02:02:59.638 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
FOOTPRINT IS SMALLER. OUR

02:02:59.705 --> 02:03:01.373 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
RESOURCES THAT WE COULD CALL ON

02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:03.542 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
NOW DON'T EXIST FOR INSTANCE IN

02:03:03.609 --> 02:03:05.211 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THE PAST IF I WANTED A BROCHURE

02:03:05.277 --> 02:03:06.212 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
PRINTED.

02:03:06.278 --> 02:03:07.880 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IN ORDER TO TELL PEOPLE ABOUT

02:03:07.947 --> 02:03:09.482 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
PROPERTY RIGHTS FOR VETERANS

02:03:09.548 --> 02:03:11.217 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
I HAD A WHOLE AGENCY THAT WOULD

02:03:11.283 --> 02:03:12.952 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
GO AHEAD AND SET THAT UP WORK ON

02:03:13.018 --> 02:03:14.520 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THAT DEAL WITH THAT. THAT NO

02:03:14.587 --> 02:03:16.589 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
LONGER EXISTS FOR US.

02:03:16.655 --> 02:03:17.857 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ALL THAT HAS TO BE DONE NOW BY

02:03:17.923 --> 02:03:19.291 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
OUR OWN STAFF.

02:03:19.358 --> 02:03:21.761 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
AND SO.

02:03:21.827 --> 02:03:23.062 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AGAIN I GET WITH WITH WHAT WE'RE

02:03:23.129 --> 02:03:23.796 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
TRYING TO DO AND IT WAS

02:03:23.863 --> 02:03:25.431 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ACCOMPLISHED BUT THE SAME TIME I

02:03:25.498 --> 02:03:27.099 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL THAT

02:03:27.166 --> 02:03:28.501 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
WE DON'T GO TOO FAR IN THEN

02:03:28.567 --> 02:03:30.536 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR

02:03:30.603 --> 02:03:32.138 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IT WE

02:03:32.204 --> 02:03:34.273 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
HAVE AWFUL CALLS TO. WRITE

02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:35.107 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
COOPER FOR IN THOSE FOLKS

02:03:35.174 --> 02:03:36.742 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
OBVIOUSLY FROM YOUR PHONE CALLS

02:03:36.809 --> 02:03:38.611 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
REFERRING TO CTF A CERTAIN WELL

02:03:38.677 --> 02:03:39.245 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
KNOW IT WELL AGAIN THERE AGAIN

02:03:39.311 --> 02:03:39.845 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

02:03:39.912 --> 02:03:41.280 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
REFERRING A PHONE CALL AND

02:03:41.347 --> 02:03:42.615 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
HELPING A CONSTITUENT THROUGH

02:03:42.681 --> 02:03:44.683 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THE PROCESS BY IS IF WE GET

02:03:44.750 --> 02:03:45.985 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THOSE SAME CLOCK NO DISTRICT

02:03:46.051 --> 02:03:47.186 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
OFFICES SO. RIGHT JUST BECAUSE

02:03:47.253 --> 02:03:50.289 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
YOU TAKE PHONE CALLS DOES MEAN

02:03:50.356 --> 02:03:50.990 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:13%
THAT.

02:03:51.056 --> 02:03:53.025 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
RESULTS IN THEIR WORK PRODUCT

02:03:53.092 --> 02:03:54.226 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
WELL TO DO A LOT OF REFERRAL

02:03:54.293 --> 02:03:55.427 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
SING FOLKS ELSEWHERE WE ARE

02:03:55.494 --> 02:03:56.195 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THERE SOME PRODUCT THAT RESULTS

02:03:56.262 --> 02:03:57.396 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
FROM THAT BUT. EVERY PHONE CALL

02:03:57.463 --> 02:03:58.264 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:38%
WAS NOT RESULT.

02:03:58.330 --> 02:03:59.632 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
IN WORK BEING DONE WELL I AGREE

02:03:59.698 --> 02:04:01.033 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ALTHOUGH AT LAST YEAR WE HAD

02:04:01.100 --> 02:04:02.201 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
FOUR THOUSAND CONTACTS WITH

02:04:02.268 --> 02:04:03.803 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
CONSTITUENTS OF WHICH MOST OF

02:04:03.869 --> 02:04:04.570 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THEM TOOK MORE THAN ONE PHONE

02:04:04.637 --> 02:04:06.005 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
CALL THEIR INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE

02:04:06.071 --> 02:04:07.139 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HELPING THROUGH A VERY CONFUSING

02:04:07.206 --> 02:04:08.707 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:30%
TAX PROCESS.

02:04:08.774 --> 02:04:10.609 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND AS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE

02:04:10.676 --> 02:04:12.111 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THINGS THAT WE THAT WE USE TO

02:04:12.178 --> 02:04:13.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
BUILD TO DO IS TAKE YOUR

02:04:13.646 --> 02:04:15.247 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CONCERNS AND GIVEN TO US AND

02:04:15.314 --> 02:04:17.149 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
THEN WE WOULD DEAL WITH THE.

02:04:17.216 --> 02:04:18.884 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
ARE AND SO I THINK AGAIN.

02:04:18.951 --> 02:04:20.186 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
I ONLY SAID THE FOOTPRINT HAS

02:04:20.252 --> 02:04:21.687 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
CHANGED BUT IT'S CHANGING A LOT

02:04:21.754 --> 02:04:22.855 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS.

02:04:22.922 --> 02:04:24.423 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
AGAIN GO BACK TO THE BASIC ISSUE

02:04:24.490 --> 02:04:25.457 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WE THINK IT WILL WORK WE JUST

02:04:25.524 --> 02:04:31.664 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:43%
NEED FLEXIBILITY.

02:04:31.730 --> 02:04:33.866 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
IT ALSO HAS BEGUN THIS.

02:04:33.933 --> 02:04:34.400 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
I GOT UP LOOKED OF PUBLIC

02:04:34.466 --> 02:04:36.869 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
COMMENT.

02:04:36.936 --> 02:04:39.572 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:48%
USE OF THIS EFFORT.

02:04:39.638 --> 02:04:40.806 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
I AM LEASE OR NOT A CHIEF OF

02:04:40.873 --> 02:04:42.007 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:58%
STAFF FOR DIANE HARKEY.

02:04:42.074 --> 02:04:43.209 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
AND I COME FROM UNIQUE

02:04:43.275 --> 02:04:44.944 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERSPECTIVE IN THAT I'M A THIRTY

02:04:45.010 --> 02:04:47.046 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
YEAR VIEW EMPLOYEE. WHO HAPPENED

02:04:47.112 --> 02:04:48.180 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TO COME FROM WHAT IS NOW CITY

02:04:48.247 --> 02:04:49.348 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%
TFA?

02:04:49.415 --> 02:04:50.850 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT STAFF I

02:04:50.916 --> 02:04:52.184 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THINK WE NEED TO BE CONSIDERED

02:04:52.251 --> 02:04:54.386 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
I'VE A THIRTY YEAR AUDITOR WHO'S

02:04:54.453 --> 02:04:56.155 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
BEEN TOLD SHE MAY BE SURPLUS TO.

02:04:56.222 --> 02:04:57.990 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AND THAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN OUR

02:04:58.057 --> 02:05:00.159 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STAFF SHOULD GO BACK TO SEA DUTY

02:05:00.226 --> 02:05:01.527 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
IF THEY WHERE THEIR STRENGTHS

02:05:01.594 --> 02:05:03.395 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
AND WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT OLIVER

02:05:03.462 --> 02:05:05.197 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
STAFF SHOULD BE EXEMPT EMPLOYEES

02:05:05.264 --> 02:05:06.632 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
OF VARYING LEVELS SIMILAR TO IT

02:05:06.699 --> 02:05:08.300 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:48%
LEGISLATIVE OFFICE.

02:05:08.367 --> 02:05:08.567 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:20%
SO THAT.

02:05:08.634 --> 02:05:10.336 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
OUR CURRENT STAFF CAN GO BACK

02:05:10.402 --> 02:05:11.837 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TO WHERE THEY CAME OR WHETHER

02:05:11.904 --> 02:05:13.205 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SKILL SET ARE. AND THEN WE COULD

02:05:13.272 --> 02:05:14.473 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
HAVE ON THE STAFF.

02:05:14.540 --> 02:05:16.108 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT WOULD PROVIDE THAT FOR THE

02:05:16.175 --> 02:05:17.343 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
NEXT MEMBER THAT COMES AND COULD

02:05:17.409 --> 02:05:18.777 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
HIRE WHO THEY WANT TO.

02:05:18.844 --> 02:05:27.353 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:10%

OF FINANCE AYE RECOMMENDS WE

02:06:43.829 --> 02:06:44.663 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THINK THERE ARE SOME LEGAL

02:06:44.730 --> 02:06:46.565 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
RESTRICTIONS THAT WOULD NOT

02:06:46.632 --> 02:06:48.100 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
ALLOW MEMBERS TO CONSOLIDATE AND

02:06:48.167 --> 02:06:50.569 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
SHARE STAFF. IN A SACRAMENTO

.

02:06:55.407 --> 02:06:57.710 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
AND AS FAR AS A TRANSITION

02:06:57.776 --> 02:06:58.877 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERIOD REDUCING THIS IS A LITTLE

02:06:58.944 --> 02:07:01.480 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
BIT OF A UNIQUE SITUATION.

02:07:01.547 --> 02:07:03.716 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
POSITIONS ARE CUT IN BUDGET AXE

02:07:03.782 --> 02:07:05.451 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
AND THERE ARE SURPLUS IN S. R.

EXACT POSITION FOR LESS THAN

02:07:15.561 --> 02:07:17.963 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FOUR YEARS. SO I DO UNDERSTAND

02:07:18.030 --> 02:07:20.499 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THERE IS THAT PROCESS IN THIS

02:07:20.566 --> 02:07:21.700 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
CASE LIKE MR RUNNER HAD AN

02:07:21.767 --> 02:07:23.502 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
ILLUSTRATED IS THAT. THESE

02:07:23.569 --> 02:07:25.170 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
EMPLOYEES THAT CIVIL SERVICE

02:07:25.237 --> 02:07:27.673 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
EMPLOYEES THAT MAY BE IMPACTED

02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:29.041 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
BY THE NEXT BUDGET ACT AT THOSE

02:07:29.108 --> 02:07:30.976 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
CIVIL SERVICE POSITIONS CHANGE

02:07:31.043 --> 02:07:34.346 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
OF THEIR EXACT POSITIONS THAT

02:07:34.413 --> 02:07:34.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ARE. SET OF CIVIL SERVICE AND.

02:07:35.047 --> 02:07:38.017 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEY WERE HIRED TO AN AGENCY AND

02:07:38.083 --> 02:07:38.384 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:38%
SO IN THE PAST.

02:07:38.450 --> 02:07:38.517 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:03%
.

02:07:38.584 --> 02:07:40.586 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:03%
.

02:07:40.652 --> 02:07:42.287 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:48%
ASSEMBLY RETAINING.

02:07:42.354 --> 02:07:44.189 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THE AGENCY ACTUALLY HIRED THE

02:07:44.256 --> 02:07:45.891 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
CIVIL SERVICE EMPLOYEES THEY

02:07:45.958 --> 02:07:47.626 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:45%
BELONG TO THE POV.

02:07:47.693 --> 02:07:50.195 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
AND WHENEVER THERE WAS A CHANGE

02:07:50.262 --> 02:07:52.164 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
IN ASSIGNMENT BECAUSE AGENCIES

02:07:52.231 --> 02:07:53.932 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
ARE ALLOWED TO CHANGE CIVIL

02:07:53.999 --> 02:07:55.300 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SERVICE ASSIGNMENTS WITHIN AN

02:07:55.367 --> 02:07:57.870 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AGENCY WITHOUT ADVERTISING IF

02:07:57.936 --> 02:07:59.872 align:middle line:79% position:53% size:68%
THERE IS A NEED TO TRANSFER
THEM.

02:07:59.938 --> 02:08:01.306 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
SOMETIMES THAT DID OCCUR WHEN

02:08:01.373 --> 02:08:02.274 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
BOARD MEMBERS.

02:08:02.341 --> 02:08:04.143 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
TURNED OUT AND LEFT OFFICE IN

02:08:04.209 --> 02:08:05.110 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:50%
NEW MEMBERS CAME IN.

02:08:05.177 --> 02:08:06.745 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:03%
.

02:08:06.812 --> 02:08:07.980 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
BUT THERE WAS NEVER AN ISSUE

02:08:08.047 --> 02:08:09.515 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THERE BECAUSE THEY WERE HIRED BY

02:08:09.581 --> 02:08:10.916 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
THE DOD WHERE MEMBERS

02:08:10.983 --> 02:08:13.385 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
PARTICIPATED IN INTERVIEWS AND

02:08:13.452 --> 02:08:14.953 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THE SELECTION PROCESS. THE

02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:16.588 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
RECRUITMENT OF THOSE THINGS THE

02:08:16.655 --> 02:08:18.524 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
HR MATTERS THE APPROVAL OF THOSE

02:08:18.590 --> 02:08:20.926 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
THINGS THE. UP PROBATIONARY

02:08:20.993 --> 02:08:23.195 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
PERIODS THE PERMANENT STATUS WAS

02:08:23.262 --> 02:08:25.564 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
AT THE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION

02:08:25.631 --> 02:08:27.366 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THERE WAS NOT ANOTHER AGENCY CO

02:08:27.433 --> 02:08:28.801 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%
THAT WAS FOR BOARD MEMBERS

02:08:28.867 --> 02:08:29.868 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:18%
OFFICE.

02:08:29.935 --> 02:08:32.304 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AND SO IN THIS SITUATION I DO

02:08:32.371 --> 02:08:34.073 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
BELIEVE THAT WE'RE INTERPRETING

02:08:34.139 --> 02:08:34.573 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:55%
UNLESS YOU CAN TELL US

02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:37.910 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
DIFFERENTLY. THAT NOW WE ARE

02:08:37.976 --> 02:08:40.312 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FUNCTIONALLY AND BUDGETARY EARLY

02:08:40.379 --> 02:08:41.947 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
INDEPENDENT FROM THE BE A WE AS

02:08:42.014 --> 02:08:44.516 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
AN AGENCY ALMOST CREATING TWO

02:08:44.583 --> 02:08:46.218 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:68%
SEPARATE ENTITIES AND THESE

02:08:46.285 --> 02:08:48.987 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
EMPLOYEES. THAT MAY HAVES AND

02:08:49.054 --> 02:08:49.521 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:60%
STARTED THEIR CAREERS AS

02:08:49.588 --> 02:08:52.224 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
APPEALING PLAY PASS PROBATION AS

02:08:52.291 --> 02:08:55.360 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
A BE A WE EMPLOYEE. AND NOW HAVE

02:08:55.427 --> 02:08:57.229 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ONLY RETURN RIGHTS TO IT WHERE

02:08:57.296 --> 02:08:58.864 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
MEMBERS OFFICE IN A POSITION AT

02:08:58.931 --> 02:09:00.466 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
WAIT MAY HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED SO

02:09:00.532 --> 02:09:01.366 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
THROUGH A BUDGET ACT.

02:09:01.433 --> 02:09:03.268 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
THEIR RETURN RIGHTS HAVE BEEN

02:09:03.335 --> 02:09:05.904 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
ELIMINATED AND SO I WOULD JUST

02:09:05.971 --> 02:09:06.972 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
SAY AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY IF

02:09:07.039 --> 02:09:08.841 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%
ANY THERE ARE BUT I THINK WE

02:09:08.907 --> 02:09:09.475 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%
SHOULD TAKE THAT INTO

02:09:09.541 --> 02:09:11.143 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
CONSIDERATION AS WE LOOK THROUGH

02:09:11.210 --> 02:09:12.678 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:53%

AND.

02:09:13.679 --> 02:09:16.048 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:63%
SO WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU.

02:09:16.115 --> 02:09:17.049 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:65%

HOW WE REALLY FIT WLL I THINK

02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:04.022 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THE GOALS OF THE TOUR DIFFERENT

02:21:04.088 --> 02:21:05.790 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
CALIFORNIA COMPETES IS REALLY

02:21:05.857 --> 02:21:08.827 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
FOCUS ON BRINGING? A NEW JOBS TO

AND THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS A.

02:21:17.902 --> 02:21:18.736 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
CHARACTERISTICS WHERE THEY MAKE

02:21:18.803 --> 02:21:20.705 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:80%
THEM HARD TO HIGHER. SO I THINK.

02:21:20.772 --> 02:21:22.774 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WE WE STILL BELIEVE THAT GOAL

02:21:22.841 --> 02:21:25.109 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:73%
WITH WE THINK THOSE TWO GOALS

02:21:25.176 --> 02:21:25.977 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:35%
ARE DIFFERENT.

02:21:26.044 --> 02:21:27.579 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:70%

THAT.

02:21:33.585 --> 02:21:36.454 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
WE THINK THAT THE THE GOALS OF

02:21:36.521 --> 02:21:38.389 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
THE HIRING CREDIT ARE SEPARATE

02:21:38.456 --> 02:21:39.791 align:middle line:85% position:50% size:75%
FROM THAT AND ARE WORTHY GOALS

02:21:39.858 --> 02:21:40.792 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:13%
THAT.

02:21:40.859 --> 02:21:43.461 align:middle line:85% position:53% size:78%
THAT. WE WANT TO REMOVE SOME OF
