RESTAURANTS AND GROW STORES THE REGIONAL INTENT OF AB THIRTY THIRTY SIX WAS ONLY MEANT TO APPLY TO CERTAIN BY PRODUCTS FROM AGRICULTURAL SOURCES. THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY NOT ENTERED THE WAY STREET. THE BASIC PURPOSE OF THIS BILL AND AB THIRTY THIRTY SIX OR TO ENABLE FARM TO FARM TRANSFERS OF AGRICULTURAL BY PRODUCTS FROM A GROWER.

I THOUGHT WE WERE TRYING TO REDUCE ORGANIC LANDFILLS CURRENTLY AGRICULTURE AND OTHER ORGANIC WASTE IS EFFECTIVELY TURNED INTO NUTRITIONAL AFFORDABLE FEEDSTOCK FOR LIVESTOCK. THIS BILL WOULD RESTRICT WHICH FACILITIES COULD DIVERT BY PRODUCTS FOR THE USE OF ANIMAL FEED AND SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPT THE CURRENT MARKET. INHIBITING FEEDSTOCK OPTIONS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA'S RANCHES AND DAIRIES. THIS BILL COULD VERY WELL PUT RENDERS IN CALIFORNIA OUT OF BUSINESS WHICH WOULD CREATE AN EMERGENCY SITUATION FOR RANCHERS DERRY'S ANOTHER ANIMAL PRODUCERS. MANY AG GROUPS SPONSORED AND SUPPORTED LEGISLATION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN AB THREE ZERO THREE SIX. TO DEFINE ALLOWABLE BY PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE TURNED INTO ANIMAL FEED. THIS BILL ON DOES MUCH OF THAT LEGISLATION AND CAUSES ON NECESSARY CONFUSION.

CORKERY ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE FIFTY FOUR BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROBERT RIVAS ANOTHER SNACK LATER GREENHOUSE GASES MYSTERY THIS THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I AM- PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWO NINE FIVE FOR A SIMPLE STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT AN IMPORTANT BILL. SO THIS LEGISLATION WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER RELEVANT STATE AGENCIES HERE CALIFORNIA AND SOME DEPARTMENTS. TO IDENTIFY IN OVERALL CLIMATE GOAL FOR CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS. ACCORDING TO THE BILL LANGUAGE THIS OVERALL CLIMATE GOAL WILL IDENTIFY ACTIONS TO SUPPORT FOR CARBON REDUCE ATMOSPHERIC GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IDENTIFY PRACTICES POLICY INCENTIVES AND POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS IN BARRIERS THAT WOULD HELP ACHIEVE THIS CLIMATE GOAL FOR CALIFORNIA NATURAL WORKING LANDS. AS WE ALL KNOW HERE CALIFORNIA THE LANDMARK ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS IN THE BILL- THREE TO ESTABLISH A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM ALL FROM ALL SOURCES IN OUR STATE. UNDER THE STATE LAW THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING A SCOPING PLAN THAT IS UPDATED EVERY FIVE YEARS. IT'S A PLAN THAT. IT DESCRIBES THE APPROACH OUR STATE WILL TAKE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES. AND IN PREPARATION FOR THE NEXT COPING PLAN IN TWENTY THOUSAND IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO. THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO ESTABLISH AN OVERALL CLIMB AGO FOR THE STATE'S NATURAL AND WORKING LANCE. THIS EFFORT WILL ENSURE THIS THIS NEXT PLAN UPDATE FULLY THAT IT CONSIDERS AND LEVERAGES THE HUGE POWER OF OUR STATE'S NATURAL WORKING LANDS IN ACHIEVING. CALIFORNIA'S AMBITIOUS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION GOALS SO WHY NOT ESTABLISH AN OVERALL NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS CLIMB GOAL HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHY NOT. THE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN SCOPING PLAN INCLUDES SECTIONS ON CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL WORKING LANDS AND AGRICULTURE. THE RESULT WAS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA FORCE CLIMATE PLAN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SCOPING PLAN FURTHER EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL WORKING LANDS SPECIFICALLY STATING THAT CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE OBJECTIVE FOR NATURAL AND WORKING LANDS IS TO MAINTAIN THEM AS A CARBON SINK. THE PLAN ALSO DIRECTED THE STATE TO QUANTIFY CARBON IMPACTS OF CLIMATE INTERVENTION ACTIVITIES ON CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL AND WORKING LANCE. AS A STATE MAKE NO MISTAKE AS A STATE WE MUST REMAIN STEADFAST IN OUR COMMITMENT AND EFFORTS TO REDUCE NEW EMISSIONS OF CARBON. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING THE PATHWAYS. PATHWAYS TO REMOVE CARBON FROM THE ATMOSPHERE. LEADING RESEARCHERS FROM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AGREE THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO FEND OFF THE WORST IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. WE MUST MAXIMIZE METHODS TO SEQUESTER OR CAPTURE CARBON. NATURAL WORKING LANDS COMPRISE OVER 90% 90% OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSE INCREDIBLE LANDSCAPE. THIS INCLUDES FORESTS RANGELANDS FARMS URBAN GREEN SPACES WETLANDS AND OUR SOILS. THESE LANDS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SEQUESTER SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CARBON. CLEARLY THERE'S NO SILVER BULLET WHEN IT COMES TO REMOVING CO TWO FROM THE ATMOSPHERE THERE'S NO SINGLE TECHNOLOGY OR METHOD THAT EXISTS TO PROVIDE THAT ALL THE CO TWO REMOVAL OTHERS REQUIRE. BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT ONE THERE ARE NATURAL WAY TO CAPTURE IT'S A QUESTION CARBON. TWO THERE ARE WAYS TO CAPTURE CARBON DATING INVOLVE COMPLEX ENGINEERING. AND QUITE HONESTLY WILL REQUIRE A TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGH. A BREAKTHROUGH THAT WILL REQUIRE INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE. AND INVOLVED NUMEROUS LOGISTICAL AND REGULATORY HURDLES. ALL OF WHICH IS POSSIBLE CAN BE POSSIBLE ONE DAY WILL BE POSSIBLE BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME AND MONEY. AND THE SECOND POINT UNDERSCORES OUR NEED TO FULLY LEVERAGE. THE POTENTIAL OF OUR NATURAL WORKING LANDS IN OUR CLIMATE CONVERSATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA. NATURAL SOLUTIONS FOR ACOSTA QUESTRADE OR CAPTURING CARBON A RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE. CAN BE IMPLEMENTED WITH LITTLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND ARE AVAILABLE TO US RIGHT NOW. THESE NATURAL SOLUTIONS INCLUDE LAND MANAGEMENT RESTORATION OF WOODLANDS AND WETLANDS AND OTHER PRACTICES THAT INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF CARBON STORED TREASON SOILS THIRTY SECOND IN ADDITION TO AYE ENSURING THAT WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS SUCH AS APPROVED WATER AND AIR QUALITY FOOD PRODUCTION LACK CONSERVATION. AND WILDFIRE PREVENTION AGAIN PASSAGE OF THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT OF CARP IN ESTABLISHING AN OVERALL CLIMATE CHANGE GOAL FOR THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL WORKING LANDS IN THIS WAY THE BILL WILL ENSURE THAT. NATIONAL LANDS ARE A VITAL COMPONENT OF OUR CLIMATE PLAN HERE IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON AVAILABLE DATA RESEARCH BY ADVANCING NATURAL SOLUTIONS TOP CALIFORNIA CHEAP EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS NOT TO MENTION CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ECOSYSTEMS OVERALL HEALTH.

EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE BY DOCTOR WEBER THE CLERK WILL READ ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE BY SOME REMEMBER WEBER AND OTHERS AN ACCOLADE EDUCATION FINANCE. DOCTOR WEBER CAN YOU MAY OPEN MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS- I PRESENT TO YOU THE TODAY AB- EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE THE SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION GRANT REPORTING BILL. AB ONE EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE WILL REQUIRE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY UNSPENT SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDS FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND USE THOSE ISLANDS AND FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES OF THE INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS. UNDER LC FF CONCENTRATION SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS ARE AIMED AT PROVIDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT TO HELP ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND FOSTER YOU. THESE FUNDS WERE NEVER MEANT TO BE GENERALLY ALLOCATED THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING CAME FROM THE PROMISE WITH THE PROMISE OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT IN ORDER TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. SINCE THE ENACTMENT OF BILL C. F. F. THESE GRANT PROGRAMS TO PAY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO SCHOOL BUT THE PROMISE OF ACCOUNTABILITY NEVER MATERIALIZED. LAST YEAR I REQUESTED AUDIT OF LOW OF HOW LOCAL FUNDING FOR SO AND CONCENTRATE GRANTS ARE BEING SPENT AND THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S REVIEW CHOSE TO AUDIT THREE CALIFORNIAN THAT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT'S CLOTHES OPEN IN SAN DIEGO. UNFORTUNATELY THE AUDITOR'S AND THEIR TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS CONFIRMED WHAT WE FEARED. THE AUDIT FOUND THAT SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND USE THEIR UNSPENT SUPPLEMENTAL AND A CONCENTRATION GRANT AS PART OF THE DISHES GENERAL FUND FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR. THE REASON WHY WE HAVE THIS BILL IS TO ENSURE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE PROPERLY ALLOCATED DUE TO. PASS IMPROPER USE OF SOME BY SOME DISTRICTS. SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN THE SAN DIEGO CLOTHES IN OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. ALL HAVE A LOAN ROLLED OVER TO THREE HUNDRED TWENTY POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION FOR FUNDING INTO THE BASE FUNDS. IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT THE ONLY FUNDS THAT THEY WERE RE DIRECTED BY THESE DISTRICTS WITH THESE FUNDS MEANT TO SERVE THE LOWEST PERFORMING STUDENTS. THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER PROGRAMS THAT MAY SAID THE SPECIAL IT FUNDING ON THE EAST AB SIX OH TWO AND THE COUNCIL PROGRAM THAT COULD PROVIDE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING TO DISTRICTS. BUT THESE RESOURCES ENJOY THE NECESSARY SAFEGUARDS IN PLACE TO PROTECT THEIR PER THEIR PURPOSE. THIS IS THE PURPOSE OF AB THIRTY EIGHT EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE. BECAUSE WE HAVE FAILED TO ACT WE HAVE GIVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS A PERVERSE INCENTIVE. TO IGNORE THE NEEDS OF OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS AND APPROPRIATE. THOSE FUNDS FOR THE PURPOSE. THIS LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY. IT'S A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS BLOW. BROWN LOW INCOME LANE LEARNERS AND SHE- FOR CARE TO BEHIND THE REST OF CLASS. IN THE AFTERMATH MATH OF COVERT NINETEEN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WE FACING A LEARNING LOS UNLIKE ANYTHING THEY HAVE SEEN IN OUR STATE. FUND ALEX FUNDS ALLOCATED TO LOW PERFORMING STUDENTS SHOULD RETAIN THE DESIGNATION IN GOOD AND BAD TIMES. THIS WILL EVEN BE MORE IMPORTANT AS I SAID AS THE POINT OF DOING POST- COLBERT NINETEEN. IN THE STATE WERE ONLY 31% OF BLACK STUDENTS AND 37% OF LATINO STUDENTS MEET STANDARDS IN ENGLISH. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION FUNDS MEANT TO ASSIST THE STUDENTS RETAIN THE DESIGNATION. AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE WILL PROVIDE THE ACCOUNTABILITY NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE CRITICAL EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT. THAT THESE FUNDS PROVIDE. A COW OF THAT MATCH. THE THOUGHT OF CHILDREN IN THE STATE WOULD NOT GETTING. THAT THEY NEED OR DESERVE. STATE OF COULD NOT. TO CALIFORNIA'S. TO EVEN IN LIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC. ESPECIALLY ALIVE IT CASE PLEASE WITH POST PANDEMIC. JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DOWN. N THE MEAN THAT THESE FUN THIS THIS FUNDING THIS. SHOULD BE SPLIT BY THIS IT'S MEDIA. THE BILL HAS ENJOYED BUT PART OF UNANIMOUS SUPPORT IMPALA COMMITTEE AND I RESPECTFULLY. FOR YOUR BOAT. THANK YOU DOCTOR WEBER MISTER. YOUR IN THE REAR OF. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I ASKED ELSE AT THAT PASS ITS- GUN LARA ON. WE'VE MAY A STARTLING LITTLE ON CLOSING GAPS IN PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT WE FOCUS MUCH MORE ON INPUTS THAN WE DO ON OUTPUTS AND EVEN WHEN IT COMES TO INPUTS I AS THE AUTHOR HAS EXPLAINED- WE'VE HAD- FAR TOO LITTLE- ASSURANCE THAT THE ADDED FUNDS THAT WE'RE PROVIDING TO DISTRICTS. ARE BEING USED IN THE WAY THAT THEIR INTENDED TO HELP STUDENTS WHO ARE MOST IN NEED THIS BILL IS A VERY GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND ALIGNS RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STATE AUDITOR I AND I ENCOURAGE AND I'VE- THANK YOU MISTER CAP BAY N. MISS QUIRK SILVA FROM YOUR DESK YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MEMBERS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AS A FORMER CLASSROOM TEACHER AND A JOINT AUTHOR ON THIS NOT ONLY AUDIT. BUT THIS BILL I SEE A MAJOR KNEE NOW ESPECIALLY THROUGH OUR COVERT NINETEEN AS WE SEE CLEARLY. THAT OUR STUDENTS THAT ARE. UP AT RISK OR EVEN MORE AT RISK. IF THAT COULD BE POSSIBLE WHICH MEANS THAT MANY MANY OF OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR. HAVE NOT EVEN LOGGED ON ONE TIME- THROUGH THEIR EDUCATION- SOME BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A BROADBAND AND SO FORTH BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE THE SYSTEM THAT THEY NEED TO PUSH THEM OUT WHERE THEY NEED TO EXCEL IN. OVER TEN YEARS AGO I STARTED AN ACHIEVEMENT GAP GROUP AN ORANGE COUNTY THAT WAS FOCUSING ON THE CHIEF MEANT GAP AND WE DIDN'T HAVE. SOME OF OUR BOARD MEMBERS THAT COULD EVEN USE THE WORD ACHIEVEMENT GAP BECAUSE THEY DID NOT BELIEVE TEN YEARS AGO THAT THE CHIEF MEANT GAP. EXISTED NOW NOT ONLY DO WE SEE T WE SEE THAT IT ALSO PERSISTS AND WE MUST WE MUST USE THAT FUNDING FROM THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA TO GO EXACTLY WHERE THOSE STUDENTS THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE MEANT TO BE. AND IN ADDITION NOT TO ROLL THAT FUNDS OVER INTO THE GENERAL FUND WHERE MANY OF THOSE STUDENTS WILL NOT SEE THAT SUPPORT SO I STAND HERE IN SUPPORT. OF THIS LEGISLATION. THANK NETWORK SILVA MISS PATTERSON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THE SPEAKER MEMBERS. I'M GONNA RESPECTFULLY YEAH LAY OFF THE BILL. BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO EXPLAIN WHY. WE TALK ABOUT INPUTS AND OUTPUTS AND SUCCESS AND ACHIEVEMENT. I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING CLOVIS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY WERE ONE OF THE SCHOOLS THAT OUT WERE IN FACT WHAT IT'D- I HAVE HIGH RESPECT. FOR OUR AUDITOR. WHAT I THINK WE FAIL TO REALIZE IN THIS IS THAT THE USE OF FUNDS BY CLOVIS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS IN FACT CREATED. ONE OF THE MOST SINGULAR SUCCESSFUL APPROACHES TOWARD MOVING ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS OP. AND THOSE WHO ARE IN POVERTY IN FACT CLOVIS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS. LOTS OF FAMILIES AND STUDENTS WHO ARE MOVING FROM OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN TO CLOVIS AT IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE SUCCESS. CLOVIS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT DOES A REMARKABLE JOB. THEY USE SOME OF THOSE DISCRETION FUNDS FOR APPROPRIATE USES THAT HELP. THE STUDENTS ALTHOUGH IT MAY NOT BE CATEGORICALLY PERFECT IT DOES RESULT IN HUGE IMPROVEMENTS WHAT I MEAN BY THAT. CLOVIS UNIFIED HAS A PROGRAM THAT PUTS OUR MENTORS SIDE BY SIDE WITH ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND WITH CHILDREN WHO ARE. IT IN UNFORTUNATELY POVERTY SITUATIONS THE OUTCOMES ARE REMARKABLE THEY IN FACT ACHIEVE AS MUCH OR GREATER THAN ALL OF THE OTHER STUDENTS IN CLOVIS UNIFIED THEY ARE TURNING INTO VALEDICTORIANS THEY ARE TURNING INTO LEADERS. NOW THEY MAY NOT THE FORMULA SUGGESTS. BUT I SUGGEST TO YOU THEY IN FACT DO IT. AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY FACTOR HERE. IS WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE STUDENTS ARE THEY IN FACT LAUNCHING THEMSELVES INTO SUCCESS THE ANSWER TO THAT IS A REMAIN A RESOUNDING YES. SOMETIMES THE COMPLAINT ABOUT CLOVIS UNIFIED IS THAT THERE ARE A- SCHOOL DISTRICT- THAT IS AFFLUENT. THAT JUST DOES NOT SUGGEST THAT THOSE WHO CRITICIZE IT UNDERSTAND. THE REALITY THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT KIDS IN PROPERTY AND SIGNIFICANT ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS THAT ARE IN CLOVIS UNIFIED AND THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS ARE REMARKABLE. AND I WANT TO ALSO SUGGEST WHEN STUDENTS. FAMILIES DECIDE TO MOVE FROM ONE. SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ANOTHER. BUT BECAUSE THE COMMUNITY HAS TALKED TO ONE ANOTHER ABOUT HOW WELL THEIR KIDS PERFORM. I UNDERSTAND THE BASIC NUMBERS ANALYSIS HERE AND I DO UNDERSTAND THE INTENT OF THE MEMBER OF SPONSORING THIS. I DO WANT TO JUST REMIND US THAT THERE ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND CLOVIS IS ONE OF THEM. THAT HAS TAKEN THOSE FARMS AND HAS ACHIEVED REMARKABLE ADVANCE. PER CAPITA BETTER ADVANCEMENTS THAN ANY OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE AREA AND IN FACT MOST SCHOOL DISTRICTS. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YES THEY DO IT DIFFERENTLY YES THEY DO IT WITH MENTORS AND WITH- OF FAMILIES AND WITH THE STUDENT HELD BY A- AND SO I'M GONNA LAY OFF. BUT WE MAKE A MISTAKE IF ALL WE DO IS LOOK AT NUMBERS AND WE DON'T LOOK AT ACHIEVEMENT I'M HERE TO SUGGEST THAT ACHIEVEMENT CLOVIS IS WORTHY OF A THUMBS UP EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE ONE OF THOSE IN THE AUDIT APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS WHAT WE BELIEVE IS WHAT IS REAL IN THE CLOVIS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I'M PROUD TO REPRESENT THEM. AND PROUD TO KNOW SO MANY FAMILIES WHO HAVE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND WHO HAVE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES THAT ARE DOING EXCEEDINGLY WELL IN CLOVIS AND ARE IN FACT MOVING TO THE DISTRICT ON PURPOSE. THANK YOU FOR THE TIME. THERE'S PATTERSON SEEING NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION. DOCTOR EVERY MY CLOTHES RIGHT ARM MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE- AND KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS IS NOT OF THIS IS NOT AN ATTACK ON ANY PARTICULAR DISTRICT THIS WAS RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE AND THEY BRANDON LEE CHOSE CERTAIN DISTRICTS TO LOOK AT OF THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN THE REPORT THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL. DISTRICTS WOULD DO USING THE A MONEY APPROPRIATELY NICOLE WAS MAY HAVE BEEN ONE OF THOSE SO IT'S NOT REALLY AN ATTACK ON CALL WAS THEY WERE JUST THE ONES THAT WOULD CHOSEN TO LOOK AT THEY LOOK AT MY DISTRICT SAN DIEGO AND- THEY SAW SOME GOOD THINGS HAPPENING I SAW SOME THINGS THAT WERE CHALLENGING THAT WERE HAPPENING THE KEY IS THAT WE HAVE AS A LEGISLATURE WE OKAY MONEY PACIFIC. AND WILL WE SAY WHAT IS MY TO FOR. THAT BUT- PERSON IS NOT FORCE. NOT A PENSION FOR. NOT FOR ANY OF OTHER THING BUT IT SHOULD FOR THAT. THEN WE LOOK TO SEE WHETHER NOW AS AN OVERALL. STATE ARE WE DOING THAT AND THEY LOOK AT SPECIFIC. TO SEE HOW THEY MANAGING THE MONEY. AND WHAT WE SAW WAS THAT THERE WAS NO REAL INTENT TO BASICALLY IN SOME CASES TO FOCUS ON THE MONEY ON THE KIDS THAT WERE MOST IN NEED- AND THEN MONEY WAS BEING HELD OVER FOR THE NEXT YEAR AND THEN ROLLED INTO THE GENERAL BUDGET FOR WHATEVER THEY NEEDED IT. AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THE DISTRICTS DON'T NEED DOLLARS THAT THEY DON'T NEED THE RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE. I THINK WHAT IT DOES SAY IS THAT WHEN WE'RE ALLOCATING MONEY FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY GOES THERE. THAT IT DOESN'T GET SHIFTED AROUND. AND WHAT HAPPENED IS EVEN. UNDER CLOVIS PEOPLE SAYING WELL WE KNOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CRISIS WE MIGHT NEED THAT MONEY. AND MY ARGUMENT CONTINUE TO SAY WHAT WOULD IN THAT PARTICULAR VEIN. AND WHEN WE HAD LOTS OF MONEY WE DIDN'T USE IT ON THOSE KIDS. I HAVE NO FAITH THAT YOU WILL USE IT NOW THAT WE'RE IN A- SAYS SO WE HAVE TO PUT SOME GUARD RAILS ON IS. SAY THIS IS MY THAT SHOULD GO TO CLOSE IT. GAP AND MANY DISTRICTS WILL DO GRAY THINGS WITH IT- BUT SOME ARE NOT AND AS A RESULT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THE MONEY GOES WORDS AND- AND IT. WE ASK FOR ACCOUNTABILITY HOUSE. AS FOR WITH. WE MAY. THIS WHICH- ISSUE. WE GOT. CFF BUS BEEN HERE FOR TWELVE YEARS. NO THE- WAS A PART. THE DEAL. THERE WOULD BE SO. ABILITY THAT WE WOULD. THEM THE A FOUR. TO YOU. IT AS A TWO. IF THEY- TO CHOOSE. IF THEY WANT TO. BASE PROGRAMS. THIS IS NOW. A SAFE I WHAT I SAY. THAT THAT ONE ONE. BUT PROGRAM. THE BEST. IN AND THOSE. OF THINGS BECAUSE- WE GAVE THEM. CAN TO BE ABLE TO YOU. THE MY- AND HOW. THEY FELT IT WAS NO. TO IMPROVE THE- ACHIEVEMENT OF KÃT. A CLOTHES MAYBE DOING THAT. RIGHT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE PUT THAT MONEY. IN THE BUDGET FOR THOSE CHILDREN. THAT WE- SURE THE- DEVELOPER. AND HOLDING. FOR THOSE DOLLARS. MAKE A- DIFFERENCE. TO NOT DO THAT. WOULD BE UNFAIR TO ALL OF THE OTHER DISTRICTS WHO DON'T GET CONSTANT. GRANTS WHEN I SIT ON THIS. EIGHT AGO AND TALKED. THIS PARTICULAR BILL. AND PUSHED IT WITH OTHERS. AND ALONG WITH MY- REPUBLICAN COLLEAGUES AT THE TIME WHO WAS THE- OF. WHO IS A- MINORITY. WE PUSH THIS BILL. BECAUSE AND WE SAID THAT WILL BE ACCOUNTABILITY AND AS A RESULT OF. GIVING EXTRA 20% TO BE CERTAIN DISTRICTS. THAT MEANS OTHER DISHES WON'T. THAT ADDITIONAL DOLLARS. AND THAT'S- YOUR TO THE- SISTERS BECAUSE THEY WERE. A COME. TO HELP US. IT GAP WITH A NOT. THAT IT IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE. TO SAY. ANOTHER HELP. IT'S WHAT. WE AGREE. ALL OF US AT THAT TIME. ON FLOOR. THIS DISTRICTS WOULD. THE TWENTY. CENT AND IF. THAT'S GET THAT. AND WITH THE. THAT EFFORT AND SOME OF YOU WHO WERE HERE REMEMBER THAT. WE MADE THAT COMMITMENT AND WE WORK AND WE WERE TOLD. THAT THERE WOULD BE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR WHAT THOSE DOLLARS WENT. AND WENT FROM YEAR TO YEAR TO YEAR AND WE COULD NOT GET THE ACCOUNTABILITY. THIS IS AN EFFORT TO GET THE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE DOLLARS-THAT WE PUT IN PLACE. IT IS NOT ATTACK ON ANY ONE OF THOSE DISTRICTS BECAUSE THEY COULD RUN ANYWHERE. AND PROBABLY FOUND THE SAME RESULTS. SO WE HAVE TO. IF WE MADE THE COMMITMENT. TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IN OUR OTHER DISTRICTS ARE NOT GETTING THOSE EXTRA DOLLARS. WE SHOULD BEEN LIVE UP TO OUR COMMITMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DISTRICTS ALSO KNOW. THAT WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT BEING ACCOUNTABLE. AND RESPONSIBLE AND GOOD CARE TAKERS OF THOSE DOLLARS. ITH THAT IN MIND AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF STRUGGLING FOR ABILITY. I RESPECTFULLY FOR I BILL.

WELL AS I MENTIONED HIS BILL IS NOT VERY BROAD IN SCOPE BUT THIS ISSUE OF PARKING- IS AN IMPORTANT ONE. IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THESE. THE MINIMUMS THAT THAT THAT ARE ATTACHED WITH PARKING HAVE UNINTENDED IMPACTS YOU KNOW THEY CAN DRIVE UP THE COST OF HOUSING THEY CAN REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNITS PRODUCED- AND IN SOME INSTANCES HAVING THIS FLEXIBILITY AS THIS BILL AS IT IT PROPOSES TO STRATEGICALLY REDUCE VEHICLE PARKING SPACES WILL PROMOTE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MOBILITY IN OUR STATE IT COULD BOOST TRANSIT RIDERSHIP WERE ASSESSABLE IN A MOBILE. I ENCOURAGE MORE CYCLING AND PUT TO USE CALIFORNIA'S EXPANDING NETWORK OF BIKE LANES IN GREEN WAYS THIS BILL COULD SERIOUSLY INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF BIKING CARSHARE PARKING A NEW HOUSING PROJECTS CERTAINLY WHAT WE NEED TO STATE AND WELL ALSO. HELP IN IN MANAGE SOME OF THESE UNINTENDED IMPACTS OF. THESE PARKING REQUIREMENTS. I KNOW THAT WE SERVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT. CONSTITUENCIES IN THIS STATE AND WE ALL DO OUR BEST TO BRING STATE GOVERNMENT TO THEM. WE DO OUR BEST TO MAKE SURE STATE GOVERNMENT MORE RESPONSIVE TO THEIR CONCERNS AND I MENTION THIS BECAUSE THIS BILL OF THIS INNOVATIVE APPROACH IN FINDING A WAY TO INCREASE BY PARKING IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR DISTRICTS. WAS AN IDEA FROM A LOCAL CONSTITUENT IN OUR FIRST EVER THERE OUGHT TO BE A LAW PROGRAM. AND SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. THANK YOU MISS RIVAS.

THIS IS AN INNOVATIVE BIPARTISAN APPROACH TO INCENTIVIZE INSURERS TO WRITE MORE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICIES. IN OUR STATES HI FIRE RISK REGION'S. THE APPROACH IS ENTITLED THE INSURANCE MARKET ACTION PLAN. EXISTING LAW LIMITS THE OPTIONS FOR INSURERS DEFINE REASONABLE WAYS TO ISSUE POLICIES IN OUR HIGH FIRE RISK REGION'S. THIS BILL AUTHORIZES AN INSURER TO FILE A PLAN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE THAT ADDRESSES THAT INSURERS PRACTICAL NEEDS. THE BILL DOES NOT IN ANY WAY TO CHANGE OR LIMIT THE AUTHORITY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER TO APPROVE OR REJECT AMERICAN MARKET ACTION PLAN FILING. IF THE PLAN IS APPROVED BY THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. THE INSURER WOULD BE SUBJECT TO A LEGAL MANDATE TO INCREASE THE VOLUME OF POLICIES IT OFFERS TO HOMEOWNERS IN HIGH FIRE RISK REGION'S. THE BILL ALSO ADDRESSES HOW TO MEASURE THE INSURERS COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS THE ISSUE MORE POLICIES AND AGAIN. THIS WILL NOT HAPPEN UNLESS. THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER APPROVED THE PLAN AND THE INSURERS WILL HAVE TO ISSUE MORE POLICIES IN THOSE REGIONS.

THIS BILL WOULD- CAP COPAYS FOR INSULIN AT FIFTY DOLLARS PER THIRTY DAY SUPPLY AND NO MORE THAN A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS TOTAL. PER MONTH REGARDLESS OF THE AMOUNT OR TYPE. THIS BILL ALSO AUTHORIZES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO INVESTIGATE PRICING OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS MADE AVAILABLE TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS CONSIDERING THE ROLE OF EACH ENTITY IN THE ENTIRE SUPPLY CHAIN. TO ENSURE THE ADEQUATE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WITH PRICING. OVER FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS SUFFER FROM DIABETES. FOR MANY CALIFORNIANS WITH DIABETES INSULIN IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF A HEALTHY LIFE. IF YOU HAVE DIABETES YOU MOST LIKELY REQUIRE INSULIN TO SURVIVE. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE PRICE OF INSULIN HAS INCREASED OVER TWO HUNDRED AND INCREASED FIFTY FIVE PERCENT. THIS GUY ROCKETING PRICE IS UNTENABLE OFTEN CAUSING UNDUE BURDEN ON OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND FORCING MANY WHO CAN'T AFFORD THEIR MEDICINE THE SELF RATION. LET'S NOT FORGET THAT THE- MANUFACTURING OF THE MEDICATION HAS NOT CHANGED IN THIRTY YEARS WHILE THE PRICE HAS GONE UP TWO HUNDRED AND 62% ACCORDING TO A STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICINE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NEARLY 26% OF DIABETES PRESCRIBED INSULIN REPORTED COST RELATED UNDER USE LEADING TO POOR GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND POTENTIAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. THAT ARE EVEN MORE COSTLY AND POTENTIALLY DEADLY. AWESOME POLLUTION FOR THE PRICE OF INSULIN HAS HAD A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR PARTICULARLY AFRICAN AMERICANS LATINOS AND CERTAIN NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATIONS AND WHILE DIABETES IMPACTS MEN AND WOMEN EQUALLY. WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO RATION THEIR INSULIN DUE TO ECONOMIC IMPACT. COVERED NINETEEN HAS ONLY EXACERBATED THE NEED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO INSULIN STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT DIABETES DIABETICS ARE AT HIGHER RISK OF CONTRACTING CORBETT NINETEEN AND ARE FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY.

IN EMERGENCY HOSPITAL VISITS WHICH IS ESTIMATED. CONCERT ABILITY CONSERVATIVELY AT ABOUT ONE POINT ONE MILLION. AND WILL NOT RAISE PREMIUMS FOR CALIFORNIANS. ACCORDING TO THE CHIU PURPOSE STUDY THAT CAME OUT TWO MONTHS AGO. FURTHERMORE DOZENS OF OTHER STATES HAVE INTRODUCED OR PASSED SIMILAR LEGISLATION. CALIFORNIA CAN AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO TAKE THE LEAD ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE WITH THAT I ENCOURAGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER IS THERE IN THIS MESS. YOUR REQUEST THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND I THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR ITS AUTHORSHIP MY MOTHER WAS IN FACT ONE OF THOSE WOMEN WHO RATIONED HER OWN INSULIN- WITHOUT ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THEN ONCE YOU BECAME QUALIFIED FOR MEDICAID. SHE DIDN'T HAVE A SINGLE MONTH OF HER LIFE THAT WAS CUT FAR TOO SHORT YOU CAN ACTUALLY AFFORD HER DILLON SHE ALSO DID NOT SHARE THAT WITH MY BROTHERS AND WITH ME SO THAT WE COULD CHIP IN TO HELP. THIS MEASURE IS ESSENTIAL IT IS HUMANITARIAN AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISS WITH. DOCTOR WOULD YOUR ADDRESS THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES. IT'S A SHAME THAT WE HERE WE ARE. LITERALLY ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS SINCE INSULIN WAS PATENTED. AND YET THE PRICE CONTINUES TO SKYROCKET THERE IS NO GENERIC FORM OF INSULIN YET AND THAT IS THAT IS A SHAME. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COP WITH THE DISEASE PATTERN OF THIS OF THIS HORRIBLE DISEASE IS AT LEAST A HEART DISEASE. GUM DISEASE- WOUND PROBLEMS AND FEELING THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT LEADING TO POTENTIALLY APPLICATIONS AT LEAST A VISUAL IMPAIRMENT THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE DISEASE AND IN CALIFORNIA NEARLY 50% OF THE POPULATION IS EITHER DIABETIC OR PRE DIABETIC. SO THE FINANCIAL IMPACTS TO OUR SOCIETY TO OUR OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ARE ARE HUGELY DRAMATIC AS I SAID IN A WEEK OR SO AGO. JUSTIN JUSTIN THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM ALONE WE SPEND THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WITH THE BE- TO TREAT OUR RECIPIENTS THEIR MEDICARE RECIPIENTS WHO HAVE DIABETES FOR ALL OF THE TREATMENT INCLUDING THEIR ASSOCIATED HEALTH CONDITIONS THIS IS A CRITICAL BILL I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE FOR THIS. THE COST TO THE INSURERS IS MINIMAL I BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL IN POTENTIAL IN FOR A PREMIUM INCREASE. VERSUS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY BILLION DOLLARS ARE MADE IN IN PREMIUMS THAT THEY COLLECT THE YEAR TO REALLY MINIMAL REALLY MINIMAL COST FOR REALLY BIG IMPACT AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUE RINGS FOR TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

THERE'S NOT A LOT I CAN DO TO HELP OUR- THIS IS SOMETHING I CAN DO TO HELP. THIS IS SOMETHING I CAN DO TO NOT ONLY SAVE MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY MEMBERS IN MY COMMUNITY. BUT HOPEFULLY.

SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL THAT LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LAW A. B. THREE THIRTY BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE SHRIVER PROGRAM SO THAT MORE CALIFORNIANS CAN BE ASSURED OF MEANINGFUL ACCESS TO JUSTICE THROUGH OUR LEGAL SYSTEM. THIS BILL EXPANDS THE STRIVE A PROGRAM IN TWO IMPORTANT WAYS FIRST THIS LEGISLATION HELPS TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR LEGAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED UNDER THE SHRIVER PROGRAM ONE OF THE FIRST CASES THAT I HANDLED AS A YOUNG ATTORNEY WAS TO HELP AND UNDOCUMENTED MOTHER SECURE A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER. IT WAS A REALLY EYE OPENING EXPERIENCE FOR ME FOR HOW VULNERABLE THIS POPULATION IS AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THEY ARE PROVIDED WITH LEGAL REPRESENTATION IN THESE HIGH STAKE MATCH. SO YOU CAN SEE FULL ACCESS TO THIS. THE SECOND. IS THAT RIGHT. COURT TO CALL AND MAKE AVAIL CERTAIN. RELATED TO FICTION. SEEDINGS INCLUDING AN AND ON LAW THAT PROCEED.

AND IT'S GONNA REQUIRE A LOT OF INVESTMENTS IN RESILIENCY AND IN MITIGATION AND IN RESPONSE FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND FROM THE STATE. BUT THE QUESTION IS WHO'S GOING TO LEASE THOSE THAT THOSE EFFORTS WHERE DO WE PUT OUR DOLLARS WHEN IT COMES TO CLIMATE CHANGE WHEN IT COMES TO SHORELINE RETREAT WHEN IT COMES TO SEA LEVEL RISE TO WILD FIRE. HOW O WE DECIDE WHAT PROJECTS TO PRIORITIZE WILL CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A WEALTH OF RESOURCES IN TERMS OF OUR NATIONAL LABS AND OUR UNIVERSITIES. WHAT AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY ONE DOES IS IT CREATES A TASK FORCE MADE UP OF SCIENTISTS TO MAKE EXACTLY THOSE KINDS OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TO THE GOVERNOR AND TWO OF THE ALL STATE AGENCIES SO THAT ANY INVESTMENTS THAT WE MAKE IN DEALING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE RESPONSE A RESILIENCY. IS MADE BY SCIENTISTS TO STUDY THIS VERY THING SO THAT WE KNOW THAT WE'RE MAKING INVESTMENTS IN THE RIGHT PLACE WITH THIS BILL AS FAR AS WE KNOW HAS NO OPPOSITION.

IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT THAT WELL PLANNED PROJECTS ARE ABLE TO MOVE QUICKLY THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS THE SEQUEL PROCESS IS IMPORTANT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I VERY MUCH RESPECT BUT SOMETIMES IT CREATES UNNECESSARY DELAYS TO BREAKING GROUND ON HOUSING AND OTHER TYPES OF LAND USE PROJECTS. AB THIRTY TWO SEVENTY NINE ADDRESSES COMMON DELAYS IN LITIGATION OVERSEE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> ACTIONS PROMOTE SWIFTER AND MORE EFFICIENT RESOLUTION OF LAWSUITS REGARDING ALL PROJECTS. THE BILL WILL CREATE MEANINGFUL CHANGE THE SUPER PROCESS WILL STILL MAINTAINING ROBUST ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS IN PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO FILE LAWSUITS ON BEHALF OF SEEK WORK.

I APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION'S PERSPECTIVE AND I'VE ATTEMPTED TO UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT THEY BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION NOW WHEN IT COMES TO SEE GROWING DOING ANYTHING TO TRY TO. MAKE A SEQUEL WORK BETTER IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF PUSH AND PULL THE CERTAINLY A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS AND I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE GOT TO BE IN A POSITION OF HAVING COMPROMISED. AND WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO IS TO TAKE ALL OF THOSE CONCERNS SERIOUSLY AND TO. FOSTER AND TO BE A VEHICLE FOR THAT KIND OF COMPROMISE SO THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE AS MANY UNNECESSARY DELAYS- AND PROJECTS WE'RE REALLY COMING TO A RESOLUTION AND HAVING DEVELOPERS ADDRESS COMMUNITIES CONCERNS SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY GOAL.

THAT'S A VERY ISOLATED CASES AND WHAT'S WORSE BECAUSE IT'S GONNA LIMIT OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE AND HE'S OUT OF SCHOOL IN RICHMOND ACTIVITIES FOR OUR NEEDIEST STUDENTS BECAUSE THE BILL SPECIFICALLY WHAT'S A PROHIBITION ON FINANCIAL INCENTIVES SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT MEANS THAT IF THERE'S A FIELD TRIP TO A MUSEUM OR MADE INTO WASHINGTON DC TO WHAT ABOUT GOVERNMENT YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HELP KIDS FROM POOR FAMILIES PAY THE COST OF THAT. I WOULD HOPE THAT SUBMITTED EVERY MEMBER OF THIS BODY SHOULD BE AGAINST ORIGINAL. THANK YOU MISTER KILEY. I BELIEVE MISTER GALLAGHER IS SEEKING RECOGNITION IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER ON THE BILL MR GALLAGHER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED YES THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS AND I REALLY URGE THIS BODY TO PUSH THE PAUSE BUTTON- ON THIS LEGISLATION MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN FAST TRACKED IT THIS TIME- CERTAINLY THINGS RELATED TO COPE WITH NINETEEN- VIRUSES IN RESPONDING AND- AND ALL THOSE THINGS THIS IS CLEARLY NOT ONE OF THOSE THINGS NEED TO BE FAST TRACKED AND AT. THE AS THE PREVIOUS MY COLLEAGUES IN ROCKLIN JUST POINTED OUT THERE'S A LOT OF PROBLEMS HERE- CERTAINLY THERE THERE MAY HAVE BEEN ABUSES OUT THERE WITH IN RICHMOND PROGRAMS BUT LET ME JUST TELL YOU AS THE PARENT. OTHER CHILD THAT IS BENEFITING GREATLY. FROM ONE OF THESE VENDORS THAT UTILIZES THIS PROGRAM. HE'S PUT THE PAS BUT YOU ARE GOING TO PUT ROADBLOCKS IN THE WAY A REALLY GOOD PROGRAMS LET ME JUST TELL YOU QUICKLY A STORY OF. THE MAN THAT I TALKED TO HEAR RECENTLY WHO CONVEYED TO ME BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE TOLD ME IN SCHOOL THAT HEY YOU NEED TO LEARN MATH BECAUSE IT WILL HELP YOU FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH. HOW MUCH FUEL IS GOING TO TAKE TO FILL UP THAT TANK. I HOW MUCH THAT TANK CAN HOLD IF SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE MADE IT PRACTICAL FOR ME. I WOULD HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH MORE IN SCHOOL WELL THAT'S WHAT MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS DO LIKE BIKING WOULD WORKS IN MARYSVILLE CALIFORNIA. THAT'S A WOODWORKING PROGRAM IN THAT PROGRAM THESE KIDS LEARN MATH SKILLS AND OTHER SKILLS WHILE THEY'RE LEARNING HOW TO. CRAFT TO MAKE. WOOD PROJECTS. THEY GET TO SEE THE FRUIT OF THEIR EDUCATION THEY GET THE HANDS ON LEARNING. IN THESE PROGRAMS AND THEIR VENDOR. THAT IS GONNA BE PROHIBITED IF YOU MOVE THIS LEGISLATION FORWARD. AS IT IS TODAY LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT BUTTE CORE CHARTER. I WHICH IS AN AMAZING CORE CHARTER- PROGRAM IN MY DISTRICT- THAT USES A LOT OF THE- IT HAS ISN'T. AND SO THEY HELP KIDS GET THAT PRICE LEARN EXPERIENCES AS MY CALL POINTED OUT I MEAN TALKING ABOUT MONEY THAT COULD BE USED TO HELP A KID TRAVEL TO WASHINGTON DC OR MAYBE RIGHT HERE TO THIS CAPITAL TO LEARN ABOUT GOVERNMENT- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROGRAMS THAT GIVE THAT PRACTICAL REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE YOU'RE GOING TO BE CUTTING THOSE OFFER YOU'RE GOING TO BE PUTTING. UNNECESSARY BURDENS IN THE WAY OF THESE ENRICHMENT PROGRAM SO I JUST I REALLY URGE YOU LET'S NOT PASSES THROUGH TODAY LET'S PUT THE POSITIVES THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSION. BOTTOM RICH MAN PROGRAMS IN ASSURING THERE'S PROPER- OVERSIGHT AND ALL THOSE THINGS. BUT PUSHING THIS BILL THROUGH WHEN IS IT IS NOT CC- AND WHAT IS NOT URGENT TO ANY CRISIS THAT'S IN FRONT OF US.

THINGS ARE HELPING KIDS LIKE MY KIDS MANY FAMILIES ACROSS THIS CUTS ACROSS THE STATE BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE BENEFIT AND I'VE SEEN IT WITH MY OWN SON.

AND FOR US AS A BODY TO STAND HERE AND JUSTIFY SOMETHING WHERE WE KNOW THERE IS RAMPANT WASTE FRAUD AND ABUSE ON BEHALF OF WELL INTENTIONED HOME SCHOOL FAMILIES IN SOME CASES BECAUSE THEY ARE IN A SYSTEM THAT HAS ALLOWED THIS TO GO ON FOR SO LONG IS WRONG WE ARE TALKING ABOUT SERVING COMMUNITIES OF KIDS IN AN UPCOMING SCHOOL YEAR WHERE WE KNOW THAT IF OUT OF CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION IS REQUIRED THESE ARE THE CHILDREN WHO ARE SITTING. IN A BATHROOM TAKING TURNS ON MOM'S PHONE TO DO THEIR EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS AT A MINIMUM WHAT OTHER CHILDREN HAVE THE BENEFIT OF EXPLORATORY AN EXTRA PROGRAMS THAT ARE TIED TO MINIMUM INSTRUCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS THIS IS ABOUT FAIRNESS IN OUR SYSTEM THIS IS NOT ABOUT PRIVILEGE BASED ON CHOICES ARE CREATED BY THE THAT THERE IS A LOOPHOLE IN THAT SYSTEM. THIS CREATES A KOREAN IN WHICH THERE IS FAIRNESS IN WHICH THESE RESOURCES ARE USED TO DEFINE EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS BUT I KNOW A LOT OF KIDS IN TITLE ONE SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE WITH TO HAVE THE PROPERTY HAVE A WORK TRIP TO WASHINGTON D. THE LOT BE ABLE TO GO TO PLAN BUT RIGHT NOW IN THIS UP BUT YEAR I'M EVERY DAY EVERY THAT HAVE GOING TO THOSE KID. BEING ABLE TO BE IF BE COPIED FREE AND EDUCATED THAT'S WHY THIS MEASURES ARE.

THE U. N. MEETS THE CONVENTIONAL BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY EARLY NEXT YEAR AB AND WILL CONSIDER WHETHER TO ADOPT A WORLDWIDE GOAL TO PROTECT AT LEAST 30% OF THE PLANET BY TWENTY THIRTY. WITH AB THIRTY THIRTY CALIFORNIA CAN PROVIDE INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP IN THE EFFORT TOWARDS MEETING THIS IMPORTANT CONSERVATION GOAL AND SET AN EXAMPLE FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. THIS BILL PLACES IN THE STATE POLICY COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. LOCAL COMMUNITIES NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES AND PRIVATE LANDOWNERS TO CONSERVE NATURAL PLACES AND RESOURCES. PROTECTING 30% DOESN'T JUST MEAN MAKING MORE PARKS IN REMOTE CORNERS OF OUR STATE. IT ALSO MEANS IMPROVING ACCESS TO NATURE FOR ALL PEOPLE IN THE STATE. INCLUDING FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THIS BILL COMMITS THE STATE TO DO JUST THAT. BY PURSUING THESE AMBITIOUS BUT ACHIEVABLE CONSERVATION GOALS BECAUSE STILL PREVENT THE MAJORITY OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS ARE GOING EXTINCT.
