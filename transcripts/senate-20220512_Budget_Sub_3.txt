THIS IS SAID PARTY PROPOSAL IS FOR EXAMPLE SHIFTING SOME OF- PROGRAMS FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS OVER TO DTS SO LET'S JUST TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE APPRECIATE MEDIA CAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES FOR THE PART IN PUBLIC HEALTH. SO DETACHED I GUESS THE QUESTION THERE IS THAT- IT YEAH I THINK PART PERHAPS YEAH AND THE CONJECTURE THAT ORIGINALLY WAS AND PART PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE THAT WAS WHERE THE EXPERTISE MAY HAVE MORE LANE IN TERMS OF DOING A PUBLIC HEALTH A COMMUNICATIONS CAMPAIGN- ARE WE JUST SHIFTING MONEY OVER OF THE SHIFTING PERSONNEL OVER WHO WERE CURRENTLY PREVIOUSLY DOING THE CAMPAIGN NOW JUST THE YOU KNOW FROM ONE DEPARTMENT TO THE OTHER- SO I IS SO IN TERMS OF IT'S NOT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE'RE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE TALK ABOUT THE MONEY BUT I'M ALSO. THINKING ABOUT THE EXPERTISE AND CAPACITY CELLS THAT COMING OVER FROM DPH ARE YOU TRYING TO BUILD IT. AGAIN YOU KNOW I WOULD SAY FROM GROUND UP CERTAINLY SEE YOU SEE DTS HAS SOME EXPERTISE IN COMMUNICATIONS BUT HE JUST BE A LITTLE BIT. TO THAT. FIRST THOUGH- YOU KNOW WE ARE ALREADY. THE WITH SHOT IN. YEAH YOU LOOK TO THE LAUNCHING OF THE- OF THE THAT. YOU HAVE THE ADDRESS TO ALL I TO ALL OF THE S. U. V. PROVIDERS TO BENEFICIARIES MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE AWARE. OF HOW TO USE THE TOOL AND HOW TO ACCESS IT THE BIG REALLY GO HAND IN HAND TOGETHER WHICH IS WHY BOTH. THE DOLLARS FOR THE- SYSTEM ITSELF AS WELL AS THE CAMPAIGN AROUND THE LAUNCHING OF. OF SHATTERPROOF I CAME TO DH CS THE PAST COUPLE. OKAY BUT- THIS IS PREVIOUSDID SO DID DPH START THE CAMPAIGN OURS- NO NOTHING EVEN STARTED THERE THAT'S- BEEN STARTED WE HAVE THE CONTRACT FOR THE SHATTERPROOF I THINK IT WAS JUST THAT. A SHIFTING OF. RESPONSIBILITY THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET I RELEASED YOU MAY REVISED SET TO SHIP THOSE OVER TO THE H. YET. WE HAD OUR STARTED THAT WORK OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL I GUESS I JUST AND YOU KNOW STATE GOVERNMENT'S LARGE IS A LOT OF DIFFERENT- CAPACITIES AND WITHIN STATE GOVERNMENT SOMETIMES SOMEBODY RESIDE SOME AGENCIES OR OTHERS. SO I JUST THE- I. THAT IN TURN OF WHY IT RICH WAS TO DEEP H. IT'S AT A- SO I JUST WANNA BE SURE. WE ARE. YOU KNOW BUILDING THAT- YOU KNOW USING CAPACITY THAT'S IN EXISTENCE AND THE STATE GOVERNMENTS- TO DO THAT AND CERTAINLY AND YEAH THAT'S AND DTS CAN'T DO YOU CAN'T DO THAT WORK. ITSELF AS WELL BUT JUST- MIGHT BE SURE THAT- WERE YOU KNOW GAIN DIRECT PEOPLE DO THE RIGHT JOB SO. ALL RIGHT BE SHE THAT- AND THEN THE OTHER QUITE I HAVE IS. THAT IN TERMS OF. THE WORKING ITSELF YOU KNOW MY GOING TO STATE MY IS GOING TO LOCALITIES. IN TERMS OF BEING SURE THAT- SO WHAT KIND OF ROLE IS THE STATE GOING TO I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THAT THE- WHEN THE LOCALES GET THE MONEY THEY GET QUITE A BIT A SAY IN HOW THEY SPEND THEIR MONEY. SO WHAT KIND OF ROLE IS THE STATE GO PLAY WITH WORKING WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES AND SO FORTH FOR THEIR- IN TERMS OF COORDINATING TO BE SURE WE MAKE. VALUE BEST USE OF THESE- DOLLARS. NOT SURE THERE'S A LIST OF I THINK THAT ARE ALLOWABLE TO THE FUNDS TO BE USED IN THE- VARIOUS SETTLEMENTS IN THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT COUNTIES ARE COMPLYING WITH THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT REGARDS TO WHERE THE FUNDS. ARE USED OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ALSO OUTLINED A NUMBER OF OUR KEY PRIORITY AREAS THAT WE WOULD BE PROVIDING EITHER. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- EDUCATION OUR RESOURCES TO CITIES AND COUNTIES IN REGARDS TO YOU AYE THOSE PRIORITIES- ADDITIONALLY I WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR- COLLECTING DATA AND INFORMATION FROM EACH OF THE CITIES AND COUNTIES ANNUALLY AND POSTING THAT. ON DH CS IS WEBSITES THAT WE WOULD BE DOING A SERIES OF DATA COLLECTION INFORMATION GATHERING FROM CITIES AND COUNTIES. I'M COLLATING THAT INTO A REPORT WHICH WOULD THEN BE A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE SO THAT IS DOMINANTLY THE ROLE THAT THE DEPARTMENT WILL WILL PLAY AND I'M SURE THE WILL INVOLVE- IT PROBABLY BE A PRETTY INTENSIVE IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS. AND THEN HE WILL BE ADJUSTING PRIORITIES AND FUNDS AS WE CONTINUE TO GO ADDITIONAL DOLLARS ARE ALLOCATED- IN THE FURTHER OUT YOURS AS WELL WHICH COULD INCLUDE SINCE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IF WE WANTED TO IDENTIFY YOU. STATEWIDE PRIORITIES BUT WE WOULD DO THAT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTIES AND CITIES A TO IDENTIFY OR SET ANY NEW PRIORITIES IN THE FUTURE AS WELL.OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT- I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL TO BE SURE THAT YOU KNOW EACH YEAR AS WE DO THE BUDGET PROCESS. UPDATE ON. OF COURSE THE STATE DOLLARS BEING SPENT BUT THE OVERSIGHT THAT YOU'RE DOING- FOR THE WHOLE. SETTLEMENT IN REGARDS TO WHAT'S HAPPENING CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. COURSE THANK YOU MUCH OKAY- ON TO A NUMBER. SUICIDE PREVENTION VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION FUND. THANK YOU SO THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING TO. OOPS THAT AS EXTRA PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO BE APPROPRIATED AS SUICIDE PREVENTION VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION FUND- FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION TO DH CS EFFECTIVE JULY TWENTY TWO THE PROPOSED AT YOUR CHANGES ARE INTENDED TO ALIGN PROGRAM SUPPORTING CRISIS CENTERS LOCATED IN THE STATE OF THAT ARE ACTIVE MEMBERS OF THE NINETY DAY NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE OF WHICH WILL BE EFFECTIVE JULY SIXTEENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- SPECIFICALLY THIS PROPOSAL WOULD SHIFT BURKE- PROGRAMMATIC RESPONSIBILITIES. I TO DH CS A SINCE DH CS HAS THE EXISTING CONTRACT TO SUPPORT THE LIFELINE CRISIS CALL CENTER NETWORK THAT IS ULTIMATELY AT THE REASONING BEHIND THE SHIFT ADDITIONALLY IT WOULD REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT THAT FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH A GRANT PROCESS- THROUGH THE ANNUAL CALL VOLUME AND REMOVED THE REQUIREMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT REPORTING. A DH YES THEY KNOWLEDGE IS THE NEED TO PRIORITIZE- THE NEED OF THOSE IN RURAL AREAS IN A DESERT COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA- HOWEVER SINCE THE SUICIDE PREVENTION CALL CENTER SERVICES AREN'T MINISTER THROUGH THE STATE CRISIS CALL CENTER NETWORK I IN THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING IN THE ANNUAL FUND IS RELATIVELY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE CALL CENTER NETWORK BUDGET ON IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN MEASURE TO BE DIFFICULT TO ASSURE 50% OF THE DESIGNATED. OF DOLLARS UP OR RURAL AND DESERT COMMUNITIES THEREFORE DH YES IS PROPOSING TO WORK WITH THE CALL CENTER NETWORK TO ENSURE THE FUNDS ARE PRIORITIZED FOR CALL CENTERS SERVING IN THESE COMMUNITIES. AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. THANK VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT FINANCE. I MOUNTAINS NOT TO ADD TO YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO HOW WILL WE ENSURE THEN I MEAN SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING WE CAN'T WE CAN'T INSURE 50% BECAUSE- MARROW QUITE UNDERSTAND BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO THE CRISIS CENTER SO. IT'S HARDER THAN TO BE ABLE TO. TO GET THOSE NUMBERS ARE WHY WHY IS IT MORE DIFFICULT. BECAUSE THE CALLS ARE GOING TO THE CALL CENTER. SURE I THINK IT'S REALLY JUST BECAUSE THE THIS THAT STATEWIDE NATURE OF THE SERVICES THAT THEY WILL BE ANSWERING I'M BUT LET ME ASK- KELLY PFEIFFER HE'S CLOSER IN ADD TO THIS IN REGARDS TO HOW WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR VARIOUS CRISIS CENTERS TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION MORE DIRECTLY KELLY CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION PLEASE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AS YOU KNOW THERE'S A NETWORK OF THIRTEEN CRISIS CALL CENTERS THAT FORMER STATEWIDE CALL CALL NETWORK AND THEY WERE COLLABORATIVELY TO HAS A SHARED MISSION TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL CALLS ARE ANSWERED. AND SOME OF THEM CROSSED RURAL AREAS IN URBAN AREAS SO WILL BE CONTRACTING WITH THE READ- CRISIS CALL CENTER IN REPRESENTING THE NETWORK TO MAKE SURE THE FUNDING IS. CRITICIZED FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES BUT IT JUST WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT. TO MAKE SURE WAS. EXACTLY ALLOCATED TO THAT REPORTING BACK ESPECIALLY SINCE THE PRETTY SMALL- VOLUME YEAR TO YEAR SO JUST THE AMOUNT OF MINISTRY OF WORK IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT RECORDED WITH A- WHOLE FUNDING AWAY FROM. THE NEEDED SERVICES. BUT WE WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO TRACK IT AT SOME LEVEL. HOW MUCH FUNDING IS GOING. TOWARDS THE RULING DOESN'T COMMUNITIES. WE BE ABLE TRACK IT AND DOLLARS DOLLAR THAT'S- WILL SET UP A CONTRACT YOU JUST MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT. IS PRIORITY. FOR THOSE CALL CENTERS THAT ARE I'M SERVING THOSE COMMUNITIES. HI THERE DEPEND. SO JUST TO CLARIFY YOU SAID YOU CAN'T. TRACK IT. BUT KEEP IN MIND THE CALL CENTERS ARE PROPOSING- YOU YOU KNOW FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OR SO ABOUT WRITING CLASS FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR THIS FIND HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN LESS THAN AMILLION DOLLARS SO OKAY WE HAVEN'T YET WORKED OUT THE CONTRACT DETAILS WE HEAR LOUD AND CLEAR THAT SOME OF THE FUNDING SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT AGAIN WE JUST WORRY THAT IT COULD BE SAID THE SMALL PERCENT YOUR BUDGET YOU HAVE TO PUT IN TRACKING MECHANISMS OF JUST OKAY THURMOND THAT MADE ME FEEL STEP BACK- I KNOW WHERE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE AND SO I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT THIS IS A SMALL SUBSET OF THE LARGER FINE. IS THERE A WAY TO TRACK WHAT PROPORTION OF THE SERVICES OF THE CALLS OR SOMETHING ARE. COMING FROM- YOU KNOW. A ROAD HAZARD CRISIS CENTERS ARE WHAT DEGREE. SICEL BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S PROBABLY THE CRUX OF THE MATTER IS WE'D LIKE TO ENSURE THAT THOSE AREAS ARE BEING ADEQUATELY SERVED SO IS THERE SOME SORT OF. REPORTING MECHANISM. FOUR I GUESS THIS IS THE NINE EIGHT EIGHT PROGRAM- WHICH WE CAN BE SURE THAT- ROLE RURAL DESERT AREAS ARE BEING ADEQUATELY SERVE SO WE CAN HAVE SOME FEEDBACK AS TO. THE LEVEL OF ACCESS HAPPENING IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THROUGH- THROUGH NOT ONLY OF COURSE THIS FINE BUT THE LARGER PART OF MONEY THAT WE'RE DEVOTING TO THIS. ABSOLUTELY SO WE SET UP- METRICS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TRACKING-HAD. TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CALLS ARE ANSWERED THAT WE'RE TRACKING- CALL VOLUMES TO LOOK AT- INEQUITIES IN THE LOOK AT INEQUITIES- BY GEOGRAPHY AS WELL REMAIN ISSUES THAT SOME OF THE CALL CENTERS SERVE. RURAL AREAS IN URBAN AREAS AND SO JUST BE HARD TO SAY THIS PARTICULAR DOLLAR HAS TO GO THROUGH THIS PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHY WHEN THE CALL CENTERS COVERING THE WHOLE AREA SO WE CAN DEFINITELY TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. ON THERE NOW AND EVERYBODY'S GEOGRAPHIC OKAY AND THEN THE CREW. AND THEN. YOU CAN REPORT BACK BECAUSE DONE THE NUMBER ON NUMBER CRISIS CENTERS AND THE- IN RURAL DESERT COMMUNITIES RIGHT. SURE WE CAN HELP WE CAN ACTUALLY CAN THIRTEEN CALL CENTERS TO WE CAN. COME BACK TO YOU SHOW. COMMUNITIES OF THOSE CALL CENTERS REPRESENTS. OKAY WELL I THINK THE IDEA AT LEAST IN MY MIND IS THAT WE- EVEN IF. YOU'RE SAYING MINISTRY LEE MAY BE A LITTLE MORE CHALLENGING AND AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO INCREASE OUR OVERHEAD AND TAKE MY MONEY FROM SERVICES. BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE SURE WE HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY. IN TERMS OF AT LEAST THE I GUESS THE INTENT AND SPIRIT OF WHAT THE ORIGINAL REQUIREMENTS WORD THAT TO SHOW THAT WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE PAY ATTENTION TO THOSE ONE BEATING THOUGH SO I'M GLAD PRECIADO PRIORITIZATION. I THINK SOME ACCOUNTABILITY- IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT IN SOME REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THOSE. COMMUNITIES ARE BEING YOU KNOW SERVE THE PROBABLY AS AS EXPECTED AND NOW THE ORIGINAL. STATUE RELEASE AND SPIRIT. OF EIGHTY NINE EIGHTY FOUR THAT WERE MEETING THAT SO- THAT SO YOUR HELP IN AND HELPING US. DO THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY MOVING ON ISSUE NUMBER FOR RESIDENTIAL AND OUTPATIENT LICENSING FUND. IN GREECE. THANK YOU DCS IS REQUESTING TO INCREASE THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER OUR RESIDENTS ARE LICENSURE AND CERTIFICATION FEES DEPOSITED INTO THE RESIDENTIAL AND OUTPATIENT PROGRAM LICENSING FUNDS OTHER PROPOSED FEE INCREASE IS NECESSARY BECAUSE OF THE FEES FOR THE RESIDENTIAL OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER COSTS. INCREASED IS FROM APPROXIMATELY GOVERNOR'S BUDGET 263% IN THE MAY REVISION AND DH CS IS PROJECTING A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND I'M GOING BECAUSE OF PROJECTED RATHER ARE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE ESTIMATED EXPENDITURES AT THIS TIME. OF FEES FOR THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER FACILITIES I WERE LAST INCREASED IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN AND SINCE THAT TIME NINE LEGISLATIVE BILLS HAVE BEEN INACTIVE ARE RESULTING IN AN INCREASED WORKLOAD AND EXPENDITURES FOR AN ADDITIONAL THIRTY ONE POSITIONS WITHOUT AN INCREASE TO THE FEES OF THE FUND- WAS IMPACTED BY PROGRAM CLOSURES AND REQUEST FOR FEE WAIVERS DUE TO THE- A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. ARE THE CURRENT THANK YOU NO LONGER SUPPORT THE H. YES EXISTING STATUTORILY REQUIRED LICENSING OVERSIGHT WITHOUT A FEE INCREASE THAT HAPPENED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU. OKAY- FOR. AND THAT'S AS IT DEPARTS OF FINANCE NOTHING TO OKAY AND EVERY WORK WITH THE WITH THE RESIDENTIAL CENTERS DISK THE FEE AT ME THEY KNOW THIS IS. YES IT WAS A PART OF THE OF THE PREVIOUS GOVERNORS BUDGET WE'RE MAKING- MODIFICATION- HERE IN REGARDS TO THE PROPOSED CHANGE- AND BELIEVE THAT I TELL YOU FIVE OR THIRTEEN HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH DATE OF DISABILITIES. OKAY AND THE FACILITIES DON'T FEEL LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE IN AND- IMPEDIMENT TO BEING ABLE TO OPEN UP. NEW FACILITIES IN A TIMELY MANNER. KELLY I WILL DEFER TO YOU IN REGARDS TO THE DISCUSSIONS THAT YOU GUYS HAVE HAD. YEAH WE- THEY ARE NOT HAPPY WITH THE FRANKLY BECAUSE IT IS CHALLENGING TIMES FOR THEM IN TERMS OF- MAINTAINING ADEQUATE WORKFORCE RESPONDING TO INCREASED DEMAND EMERGING FROM THE PANDEMIC. AND THEY WE HAVE BEEN COMMUNICATING WITH THEM ABOUT THE NEESSITY OF IT AND THAT WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE GIVEN HOW ARE FEES ARE STRUCTURED IN THE REQUIRED TO BE. SELF SUPPORTING. OKAY I MEAN TO DEMEAN. THAT THAT'S PROBLEMATIC IS AS WE'RE TRYING TO OPEN OPEN UP MORE FACILITIES IF THE IF THE LICENSURE AND CERTIFICATION FEES ARE GOING TO BE. AN IMPEDIMENT SO WE'LL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT- MIKE PENCE. BUT SO YOU MENTIONED A PART OF THE REASON FOR THE- FOR THE FARM FUND IS ACTUALLY BECAUSE YOU HAD TO GIVE A FEE WAIVERS AND OTHER- ACTIONS- BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC DID I HEAR THAT CORRECTLY. YES IS MULTI FACTORIAL THEY HAD ME WE'VE HAD SOME SOME FACILITIES CLOSE AS THE SEVENTIES DURING THE PANDEMIC STATES FINANCIAL HARDSHIP AND GET A FEW WAIVERS BUT HONEST THE BIGGEST. ISSUE IS LEGISLATIVE BILL THAT IS ASKING US TO STEP UP OVERSIGHT MONITORING AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH STAFF COST AND SO- WEEK AND NOT REYES WE DON'T HAVE ANY MECHANISM TO RAISE FEES BASED ON ACTUAL LITERALLY WE JUST GOT IN. SO THE QUESTION I HAVE IS THAT OF SO SOUNDS LIKE YOU SAID THERE'S THREE FACTORS RIGHT SO ONE IS CLOSURES SO OBVIOUSLY CLOSED SO HE DOESN'T PAY ANY FEES. TO IS YOU HAVE FACILITIES UNDER STRESS AND SO THEY'RE ASKING FOR FREE WAIVER SO IT CAN CONTINUE OPERATING WHICH YOU KNOW IT'S NOT NAZARIAN APPROPRIATE THE THIRD YOU SAID OF COURSE IS INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO INCREASE REQUIREMENTS THAT MIGHT IMPACT THE LEGISLATURE. OTHER REASONS. CAN YOU. SO IN TERMS OF THE- AND THE FEE WAY. CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT PERCENTAGE OF I GUESS. THE S. LICENSEES WILL FALL UNDER THAT CATEGORY- IN THE LESS SO THAT THEY TWO YEARS AGO WE HAD HOW MANY LICENSEES AND THEN WE'VE LOST HOW MANY FORECLOSURES AND HOW MANY HAVE. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THOSE ARE CLOSE AND WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THOSE HAVE GOTTEN FEW WAIVERS. EVERY AT LEAST GIVE ME A ROUGH ORDER OF MAGNITUDE IS ARE WE TALKING LIKE 10% 20% 30% 50% IT IS A SMALL NUMBER OF CLOSURES RELATIVELY. AFFECTS YOUR VERY SPECIFIC OKAY. SO SMALL NUMBERS TO SMALL AT THE END OF FIVE PERCENTAGE UNDER TEN PERCENTAGE EXACT OKAY AND THEN IN A FEW WAIVERS REPRESENT ROUGHLY WHAT PERCENTAGE IS THAT. AGAIN I NEED TO GET BACK TO THE- AND THE LEGISLATIVE PROCLAMATION I DON'T PROMISE YOU I WON'T HOLD YOU DIRECTLY TO THE EXACT NUMBER- BUT ARE WE ARE WE LOOKING AT THIRD ARE WE LOOKING AT. 10% ARE WE LOOKING AT HALF. YEAH I WHAT I IN MY UNDERSTANDING FROM WORKING WITH MY TEAM CLOSELY ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE ARE DOES THAT AS HAPPY TO INCREASE FEES AS THE BIGGEST ISSUE WAS THAT. GRADUALLY OF STAFF AND INCREASED WITH EVERY LEGISLATION THAT PASSED WE HAVE ADDITIONAL STAFF TO COME WITH AND THAT'S THE BIGGEST IMPACT. BUT I AM IN THE FEE WAIVERS AND THE CLOSURES MUCH SMALLER CONTRIBUTORS THAT CAN DEFINITELY GET BACK TO AMERICANS. ALL RIGHT SO I THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO SORT OF BREAK THAT DOWN AND- GIVE US FEEDBACK ON THAT. BECAUSE OF THE WEEK YEAH WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A- A POTENTIALLY- I GOT SELF HEATING CYCLE IF WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT. WE HAVE CLOSURES AND FEE WAIVERS WHICH THEN OF COURSE DECREASES NUMBER PEOPLE ARE PAYING FEES AND WE'RE TELLING THEM WE'RE GONNA INCREASE YOUR FEES. ETCETERA AND THEN OF COURSE THEN THAT MAKES MORE FACILITY SAY HEY WE NEED THE WAIVERS AT CETERA RIGHT BECAUSE NOW THESE ARE HIGHER. SARAH SO THAT'S THAT THAT WOULD BE A SELF REINFORCING CYCLE THAT WE WOULD NOT WANT TO GET INTO SO I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU'RE REQUIRED BY LAW. SB SELF SUSTAINING GOT THAT- BUT ALSO WANT TO BE SURE WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE DRIVERS BEHIND THIS SO THAT WE DON'T CREATE A SITUATION WHERE ACTUALLY AS WE ARE HAVING GREATER NEED FOR THEIR SERVICES THAT WERE ACTUALLY DRIVING DOWN THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS. AND AND SO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND OUR ROLE IN IN THAT. SO IF YOU CAN HELP US PROVIDE SOME ANALYSIS OF THAT THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. AND I KNOW L. A. L. SAID THEY HAVE NOTHING TO COMMENT UNTIL. ITEM ONE OF ELEVEN OR SOMETHING BUT- IF THEY'RE LISTENING I PRAY ASK THEM IF THEY COULD HELP US OUT WITH TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. AGAIN- WE- THE ROLE DIFFERENT THESE ASPECTS OF THAT. SO THEY WE CAN APPROACH. ADDRESS THE CITY WHETHER WE TO. PLACE TEMPORARY SUBSIDIZE. THIS THIS FUND BECAUSE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OR- ARE SIMPLY DO A FEE INCREASES YOU'RE PROPOSING IT CETERA BUT WE- I THINK THE WE NEED TO LOOK. MORE BROADLY OUR POLICY OPTIONS BE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT CREATING A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE ACTUALLY DRIVING DOWN. THE VERY. PROVIDERS THAT WE NEED. THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BUDGET AND OTHER LEGISLATION TRYING TO DRIVE UP. SO INCREASE CAPACITY THANK YOU. YEAH I WOULD- I WOULD. ECHO THAT SEEM THAT SEEM CONCERNED AND IF. IF WE ARE LIMITED BECAUSE THE- IT NEEDS TO BE SELF SUSTAINING THEM PERHAPS WE JUST WE NEED TO LOOK. AT THAT ISSUE ITSELF- AND FIGURE OUT MAYBE A DIFFERENT. JUST TOTALLY FEE DEPENDENT. BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM TO BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO OUR ULTIMATE GOALS. OF GETTING MORE PEOPLE IN INTO. NOT THE STREETS AND INTO TREATMENT AND- AND MEETING THOSE TO BE EFFECTIVE SO- WILL WILL HAVE MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT AND AGAIN I WOULD A GOOD DOCTOR PANTS REQUEST OF LA WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. AND MAYBE PROVIDE US WITH SOME MORE POLICY OPTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO. BETTER STRUCTURE THAT FUND. OKAY ISSUE NUMBER FIVE A MEDIC CAL TELEHEALTH POLICY. OR ALSO AFTER THE ONSET OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY DH YES IMPLEMENTED- A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR ROWLEY'S COULD CONTINUE RECEIVING ACCESS TO SERVICES- WHEN IN PERSON ENCOUNTERS WERE NOT RECOMMENDED AT THAT TIME OR WERE NOT AVAILABLE OF ALL OF OUR POST PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY POLICIES WHICH ARE IN OUR PROPOSAL- SAID YES YES HAS PUT FORWARD- REALLY GROUNDED IN SEVEN KEY PRINCIPLES AND I MENTIONED THAT JUST BECAUSE I THINK THAT THEY REFLECT GONNA HOW WE FELT THE PROPOSAL ON HOW WE WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS- IT INCLUDES EQUITY ACCESS STANDARD OF CARE YOU SHOULD CHOICE CONFIDENTIALITY STEWARDSHIP. AND PAYMENT APPROPRIATENESS AND WE REALLY USE THOSE TO KIND OF GROUND THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE HAD AS YOU ARE AWARE WE ARE HELD A TELEHEALTH ADVISORY AYE WORKERS BASED ON LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- AGREEMENTS I WHICH CONSISTED OF A NUMBER OF SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS ARE WE CAN BE NOT A VERY- ON A REGULAR BASIS ULTIMATELY. AS I. DO THE REPORT END OF LAST- FOR THEIR ALLEGED AND OTHERS TO UNDERSTAND THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS THAT WERE TALK ABOUT WITHIN THAT- TELEHEALTH OF WORKGROUP. AND THAT IS POSTED ON DH THE ESSENCE WEBSITE AND THEN AS A PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE RELEASED OUR TELEHEALTH POLICY. INCLUDING TRAILER BALL. ALTHOUGH I JUST DO A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING DID NOT. ANSWER THE DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING- TO MAINTAIN MANY OF THE POLICIES THAT WERE INTRODUCED DURING THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY. INCLUDING THE CONTINUATION OF COVERAGE OF SYNCHRONOUS VIDEO AUDIO ONLY AN ASYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH COVERAGE ACROSS MULTIPLE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEMS- EVEN INCLUDING MANY OF OUR WAIVER PROGRAMS. ON BUT ALSO ACROSS OUR BROAD MEDICARE PROGRAM BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS WE ARE ALSO PROPOSING TO CONTINUE ON PARITY AND REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS BETWEEN IN PERSON SERVICES- AND SELECT A TELEHEALTH MODALITIES INCLUDING SYNCHRONOUS VIDEO SYNCHRONOUS AUDIO ONLY- AND ASYNCHRONOUS A STORM BOARDS ESSENTIALLY. IN THE PARITY ACROSS THE BAY AREA IS A MAIN TELEHEALTH MODALITIES RASO- I RECOMMEND YOU TO REMOVE THE SITE LIMITATIONS FOR THREE SEASON RUN HEALTH CLINICS. I ADDITIONALLY WE ARE LOOKING AT- AND PROPOSING TO ALLOW ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW PATIENTS ONLY THROUGH. IN PACE SET IN PERSON FACE TO FACE- OR SYNCHRONOUS VIDEO. SERVICES AS THE ESSENTIALLY THAT WOULD MEAN THAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING TO YOU NOT ALLOW FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW PATIENT PATIENTS ONLY SAYING AUDIO ONLY OR AB ASYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH. AND IN CONSULTATION WITH MANY OTHER MEDICAID DIRECTORS THIS IS A PRETTY CONSISTENT ACROSS THE STATE ARE THERE ARE VERY FEW THAT ARE ALLOWING AUDIO ONLY FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW PATIENTS AT THIS TIME- WE DO. RECOMMEND THIS BECAUSE WE DO THINK IT WILL BE TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE BY STEP MACHINE YOU PATIENTS VIA TELEHEALTH. IN PERSON. AND AS AT THE VIDEO- HOW WE ARE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE WE ARE THE OF. TO I DIDN'T OF THE PAGE AND- THERE BY IMPROVE PROGRAM INTEGRITY ENSURING THE DEEPER LEVEL OF INITIAL OF PATIENT PROVIDE CAN. AND RELATIONSHIP- DURING THAT INITIAL VISIT ON THE OFTEN REQUIRES ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT EVALUATION OR ASSESSMENT THEN AWESOME THE FOLLOW UP VISIT. ADDITIONALLY THROUGH THOROUGH DISCUSSION WITH THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE- AT STAKEHOLDERS WE MADE ONE EXCEPTION WHICH IS NOTED IN OUR PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY OF REFUGEES RURAL HEALTH CLINICS AROUND THE ASYNCHRONOUS TELEHEALTH. OF FOR THE VIRTUAL DENTAL HOME SO WE HAVE MADE THAT EXCEPTION WITHIN OUR RECOMMENDATION AND IS NOT REFLECTED IN OUR AT TRAILER BILL AS WELL. WE ARE ALSO REQUIRING THE USE OF SPECIFIC MODIFIERS TO IDENTIFY THE TELEHEALTH MODALITIES. USED OF INCLUDING INDUCTION OF THE- NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED CPT CODES FOR AUDIO ONLY VISITS I REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST DATA POSSIBLE I TO BE ABLE TO REPORT OUT FUTURE- YOU KNOW QUALITY. IMPACTS OF TELEHEALTH ACCESS TO THE DIFFERENT MODALITIES- AND SO WE AT WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THAT. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING TO ENHANCE A PATIENT PROTECTIONS AS A RELATIVE TO TELEHEALTH. INCLUDING STRENGTHENING CONSENT LANGUAGE FOR PATIENTS INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO FACE TO FACE AS SERVICES I USE OF TELEHEALTH OF BEING AT THE OPTION OF THE BENEFICIARY IS REALLY CRITICAL HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR FROM THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. HOW IMPORTANT THAT WAS ADDITIONALLY ENSURING BENEFICIARIES RECEIVE INFORMATION ON THE AVAILABILITY OF TRANSLATION SERVICES AND MAKING SURE THAT THAT IS CONTINUALLY BEING OFFERED WHEN TELEHEALTH IS BEING OFFERED AS WELL JUSTICE WAS REQUIRED WHEN SOMEONE WAS IN AN IN PATIENT. IMPATIENCE SORRY IN PERSON VISIT. ADDITIONALLY I WE ARE ALL OF RECOMMENDED TO PHASE IN A REQUIREMENT THAT NO SOONER THAN A TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- THAT PROVIDERS ARE OFFERING. INDIVIDUALS THE CHOICE ABOUT VIDEO. OR AUDIO ONLY THEY ARE DUE BOTH SO THE BE IN. OF TO. AND THE I- ONLY OPTIONS ARE IT'S JUST MAKING THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE A CHOICE. OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES.

TWENTY POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND IN THE FISCAL YEAR THE U. S. RECEIVED NINETY SEVEN HERE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR MODERNIZATION OF OUR SYSTEM WHICH ARE CRITICAL FOR ADMINISTERING THE FINAL PROGRAM. THE RESEARCH REQUEST SUPPORT ACTIVITIES THE FOLLOWING APPROVED PROJECT THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AFTER HE CAN YOU WORK TO DEVELOP THE OVERALL. DRIVE MODERNIZATION STRATEGY LIVE FROM THE PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE INTO SOLUTION DESIGN DEVELOPMENT DEPLOYMENT FOR THE NEW CALIFORNIA AUTOMATED RECOVERY MANAGEMENT SOLUTION AND CONTINUE WORKING THROUGH THE PROJECT APPROVAL BY CYCLE FOR THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH MODERNIZATION PROJECT. AND WORK EFFECTIVELY ON STAGE THREE WHICH IS PROJECT PROCUREMENT. TO KEEP PACE WITH SERVICE DELIVERY CHANGES FROM THREE FOR SERVICE AD MANAGED CARE AND TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES WILL RESTART THE QUESTION FOR YOU. THE CASF CHANCE OF MODERNIZATION APPROACH FROM FOCUSING ON INDIVIDUAL TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS ARE PROJECTS. FOCUSING ON THE ENTIRE MEDICAID ENTERPRISE. AND OVER PLAN TO INCREMENTALLY MODERNIZE OUR SYSTEM THE SYSTEM NECESSARY TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT CONTACT AFRICAN WE CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THE SUBJECT THE ROBUST LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT. VIA QUARTERLY BRIEFING IN THE ANNUAL BUDGET. WILL HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FINANCE. INTERCAPITAL BERMAN ON FURTHER. OKAY AND I THINK ELIO HAS SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT THE ONE ALL RIGHT L. L. GOOD MORNING METZGER L. A. I WE HAVE NOTICED APPROVE WITH PROVISIONAL BUDGET BILLING. THERE WERE THAT A TO SAY IT'S A MY- STRATEGY FOR THIS EFFORT VILLAGE- THE MES. EFFORT WILL UPDATE AND REPLACE MANY OF THE I. T. SYSTEMS THAT SUPPORT THE STATE'S MEDICAID PROGRAM. IN THE INITIAL STRATEGY WILL OUTLINE THE GOALS OUTCOMES TARGETS FOR THIS EFFORT DECIDE THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE EFFORT AS WELL AS START TO EXPLAIN HOW ALL OF THE PROJECTS WITHIN THIS EFFORT WILL BE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED. CONSISTENT MEETING THIS DOCUMENTATION TO THE LEGISLATURE WILL HELP TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EFFORT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND MITIGATED. AND HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO COMPLETE THIS EFFORT AS WELL AS AT WHAT COST- IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDERS THIS LANGUAGE TO BE POTENTIALLY DUPLICATIVE OF THE CURRENT BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES QUARTERLY MEETINGS- BUT WE THINK MODIFYING THE LANGUAGE TO SPECIFY THAT THE STRATEGY DOCUMENTATION BE DELIVERED. BY THE END OF THE BUDGET YEAR WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND CLARIFY- THIS EFFORT AS IT MOVES FORWARD THANK YOU. HI THANK YOU AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT RECOMMENDATION AND AN AGREEMENT WITH THAT- CAN. SO CAN YOU- F. DTS SECOND. HE SPEAK TO. A POLICY WE HADN'T NUMEROUS EXAMPLES OF OUTDATED SYSTEMS THAT HAVE FAILED US- DURING CRITICAL MOMENTS- AND- FINDING OUT THAT WE HAVE LEGACY SYSTEMS THERE EVEN WRITTEN AND- YOU KNOW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES THAT- NO ONE LEARNS ANYMORE WE'RE TRYING TO POINT RETIREES. WHO WHO KNOW KOBOL ANOTHER TYPED LANGUAGES WHICH I THINK IF I SHARED THEM WITH THE- PEOPLE WHO ARE MUCH YOUNGER AND I THINK WHAT'S THAT- SO CAN MAYBE SPEAK. WHAT'S THAT STATE OF THE OF SOME OF THESE MEDICAL SYSTEMS ARE WE ARE WE IN THAT SITUATION WITH MEDIC CAL- AND FOR SOME OF OUR SYSTEMS LEGACY SYSTEMS AND THEN ALSO IN TERMS OF THE MODERNIZATION APPROACH- YOU KNOW HOW. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW YOU'RE WORKING WITH- FOR EXAMPLE WELL I MEAN I THINK IN THE- CITY ITSELF IS A VERY LARGE DEPARTMENT BUT WORKING WITH THAT. THE THE PART OF TECHNOLOGY AND WITH THE- WITH THE- I GUESS SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND- THE PART HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ON THESE PROJECTS. YEAH THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION I'M NOT GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER CHRIS RETURN TO GIVE YOU MORE DETAILED. FONG THANK YOU. HEY CHRIS RESEND DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER AND- SO FIRST QUESTION ABOUT THE STATE OF THE SYSTEMS- ABSOLUTELY- D. ACS HAS. HUNDREDS OF BUSINESS APPLICATIONS THAT ARE PART OF HOW WE DO BUSINESS EVERY DAY AND SOME OF THOSE SYSTEMS GO BACK FORTY PLUS YEARS IN TERMS OF HAVING BEEN BUILT. AND THEY'RE STILL WRITTEN IN THE SAME LANGUAGES THAT THEY WERE ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IN SOME OF ITS COBALT- IN FACT WE JUST HAD THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MEDS SYSTEM ONE OF OUR CRITICAL STATE SYSTEM SO- YES WE'RE IN THAT BOAT- NOW JUST BECAUSE IT IS A SYSTEM. THAT IS WRITTEN IN AN OLDER LANGUAGE DOESN'T MEAN. THAT IT IS NECESSARILY OF SIGNIFICANT RISK- I'LL JUST USE MEDS AS AN EXAMPLE IT HAS CONTINUED TO OPERATE- OUR STATE STAFF TO SUPPORT THE SYSTEM DO A GREAT JOB- BUT YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IS A RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO HIRE INDIVIDUALS. AND HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO RUN THOSE OLDER SYSTEMS. I WILL SAY I'VE HEARD OF- RECENTLY- AND WELL MAYBE IN RECENT YEARS ABOUT KOBOL. BEING TALKED ONCE AGAIN IN COLLEGES. HOWEVER I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD BASE OUR FUTURE ON ON THAT LAST THAT SITUATION I THINK IT'S MORE BECAUSE IT CAN BE LUCRATIVE BECAUSE QUITE A FEW ORGANIZATIONS ACTUALLY HAVE- OLDER SYSTEM- IS THAT GOOD FOR YOUR FIRST QUESTION YEAH YOU KNOW THAT THAT THAT'S HELPFUL- SO I GUESS- JUST LOG OUT SWITCH FROM COBALT TO FORTRAN AND NOW EVERYONE'S GOING LIKE WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT I THINK WE'RE REALLY DATING OURSELVES- YES. IN AN HOUR APPROACH FOR THE NEW SYSTEMS IS ABSOLUTELY MODERN- BOTH IN TERMS OF- OUR APPROACH TO BUILDING THOSE SYSTEMS BUT ALSO THE TECHNOLOGY IN THE LANGUAGES THAT WE USED TO BUILD THEM- THE SECOND QUESTION IN TERMS OF THE CURRENT- WORK HAPPENING TO BUILD OUT THE APPROACH IN THE STRATEGY FOR HOW WE CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD ON MODERNIZING ALL OF THESE SYSTEMS- YES WE WORK- CLOSELY. PARTICULARLY WITH- DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY IN FACT WE HAVE REGULAR WORK AT IT THAT'S OCCURRING- FOR US THIS WORK TO PLAN OUT THAT STRATEGY IS NOT AT A PROJECT LEVEL- IT'S AT A HIGHER LEVEL. AND WE HAVE REGULAR INTERACTIONS AND INVOLVEMENTS WITH DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY- THEY ARE INCLUDED IN THE REGULAR UPDATES THAT WE DO- SOMETIMES ON A WEEKLY BASIS SOMETIMES- EVERY OTHER WEEK. AND WE REGULARLY INVITE THEM TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND- COMMENTS ON WHERE WE'RE AT WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON AT THE TIME- BUT OVERALL THE APPROACH AND STRATEGY. IN ADDITION- WE HAVE PROVIDED THEM- IN ESSENCE- WORK PRODUCTS OR DELIVERABLES OUT OF- THIS EFFORT AND- SO THAT THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH BROAD MORE BROADLY WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION AND HOW- FEEDBACK PROVIDED TO US THAT WE CAN TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AS WE CONTINUE TO REFINE. THE OVERALL APPROACH IN THIS IS THIS WILL BE NOT JUST AS WE WORK ON THE APPROACH AND STRATEGY BUT IT'S AN ONGOING RELATIONSHIP AND PARTNERSHIP. THAT WE HAVE WITH THEM SO IT WILL CONTINUE AS WE GO FORWARD ON THIS- VERY BROAD AND- EVERY COMPLEX AND LARGE EFFORTS. IN ADDITION FROM A COW HHS AGENCIES STANDPOINT- WE HAVE SOME VERY SIMILAR RELATIONSHIP IMPACT- SO THE OFFICE OF THE AGENCY INFORMATION OFFICER IS INVOLVED IN THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING- THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT- MAYBE MORE HANDS ON IN CLOSER TO THE WORK- AND- WORKING WITH US TO DEVELOP. WHAT WE HAVE- BUT THEY ALSO PROVIDE REGULAR FEEDBACK COMMENTS AND HELP US TO CONTINUE TO SHAPE WHERE WE'RE GOING- IT'S NOT THE OFFICE OF SYSTEM INTEGRATION THE WE WORK. CLOSELY WITH THEM ON VARIOUS EFFORTS THAT IT THAT ARE TIED TO ALL OF THIS- AND MEETING THE OVERALL. MATT OKAY ALL RIGHT WELL GUESS I GUESS THIS YOU OBSERVE IN AGAIN BRIGITTE L. A. AS RECOMMENDATIONS- BUT UNFORTUNATELY- IT PROJECTS- WHEN THEY GO WELL WE DON'T HEAR MUCH ABOUT HIM- WHEN THEY GO BADLY- THEY MAKE THE FRONT PAGE OF THE NEWS- THEY'RE USUALLY FAIRLY EXPENSIVE SO THERE'S A CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT IN STATE RESOURCES SO I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS JUST PROBABLY JUST SOME AND YOU KNOW THE TWENTY MILLION WERE NOT TALK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. PLANNING AND SO FORTH AND FIGURING THINGS OUT NOT ACTUALLY- BUT I THINK THE OTHER THING IS THAT- WHEN IT COMES TO I. T. AND YOU KNOW YOU TO TALK ABOUT LEGACY SYSTEMS AND SO FORTH AND- AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THE ISSUE ISN'T SO MUCH A LEGACY SYSTEM CAN'T WORK- IS THAT- IS THAT AS YOU POINT OUT AND- THANK OVER TIME- IT MAY BECOME MORE MORE CHALLENGING. TO FOR IN TERMS OF HOW IT LINKS TO OTHER SYSTEMS HAVING FINING THE PERSONNEL TO MAINTAIN IT TOO IF IN CASE SOMETHING DOES HAPPEN. TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS AND SO FORTH AND SO THE EVENTUALLY GONNA NEED A TRANSITION PLAN- TO MORE MMHM THE L. BUT DATED SYSTEM THAT IS GOING TO BE THAT THERE'S GONNA BE MORE MANAGEABLE SO WHAT. ENOUGH URGENT THE WAIT THE GREATER CHALLENGE BE THAT- I THINK IF THE APPROACH IN THE FUTURE IS NOT SO MUCH WHY CALL LIKE YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THAT WE NEED ONE SYSTEM OR ONE VERY LARGE SYSTEM TO THEN TAKE CARE OF ALL OF THAT ACCOUNT ALL RIGHT. IT'S ACTUALLY HOW DO WE BUILD MODULAR SYSTEMS RIGHT SO THAT THERE'S- SO NOT FOR EXAMPLE TRAPPED WITH THE- THE WITH ONLY HAVING. TWO OR THREE VENDORS WHO CAN HANDLE HUGE SYSTEM RIGHT IT'S AT THE HEART OF THE BUILDINGS IN THE MODULAR WAY THAT CAN. AND FRANKLY OF ALL RIGHT SO IT'S NOT ABOUT BUILDING A SYSTEM FOR- YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN FIVE YEARS OR WHATEVER THAT WILL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING AND THEN WE NEED TO REDO IT AGAIN AND THIRTY YEARS AFTER THAT IT'S MORE LIKE IT HOW HOW DO WE BUILD SYSTEMS THAT CAN INVOLVE. THIS TECHNOLOGY EVOLVES RATE SO- AND OUTLINING THAT APPROACH I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT SO HOW DO WE TAKE WHAT WE HAVE NOW HOW DO WE EVOLVE THAT INTO THE FUTURE. HOW DO WE BILL HOW YOU BUILD OUT A- AND I. T- ESSENTIALLY ECOSYSTEM. THAT CAN SERVE THE NEEDS A MEDIC CAL EVEN AS YOU KNOW WE'RE MAKING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO MEDIKAL ITSELF. AND THAT- AND THAT I. T. UP NO WE FOR EXAMPLE. WE'VE HEARD THAT ONE REASONS THAT BEEN GIVEN FOR FREE FOR WHY WE HAVE TO DELAY AND TRYING TO ROLL. UNDOCUMENTED DAHLE SEWER NOT SEE THREE. VILLAGE WELL WE NEED TO HAVE SYSTEMS THAT CAN MOVE AT THE SPEED OF WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE POLICY- AND THEN OF COURSE YOU KNOW YOU DIDN'T WITH CMS AND SO THERE'S- NO POLICY THAT CHANGES RIGHT AND- WHETHER. IT'S GOOD THINGS- LIKE CAL AIM AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AND SOMETIMES THERE'S OTHER REQUIREMENTS AND WE JUST ACTUALLY HAD A VCP ABOUT YOU KNOW INCREASING REQUIREMENTS FOR. TERRA SO- FOR- FOR EVALUATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY RIGHT SO- SO WHAT. WOULD BE HELPFUL IS TO BE ABLE TO SEE AND AGAIN GOING BACK TO WHAT THEY LOW RECOMMENDATION IS THAT. SO WHAT IS THAT. SIR THAT PATH TO BUILDING THAT KIND OF AN IT SYSTEM FOR MEDICARE WHICH OF COURSE ALSO S. INTEGRATE. AND CONNECT WITH ALL THE OTHER SOCIAL SERVICE AND- OTHER HEALTH CARE RIGHT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A- A YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A- YOU KNOW BETWEEN A- PEAK. PAYER DATABASE TO ON THE HEALTH SIDE TO HAVING A- YEAH- THAT THE HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE AND THEN ON THE SOCIAL SERVICE SIDE OF COURSE WITH MEDICARE HOW DO YOU KNOW HOW THAT CONNECT FOR ALL THE ELIGIBILITY STUFF THAT HAPPENS NOT ONLY FOR MEDICARE- BUT FOR OTHER SOCIAL SERVICES AND SO FORTH. SO CERTAINLY MEDICAL SYSTEMS. THEN OF COURSE WE HAVE COVERED CALIFORNIA AS WELL. SO YOU SET THE SET A LITTLE BIT OF A NEXUS OF. HAVING INTERFACE WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT SYSTEMS THAT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF SERVICE NOT ONLY FOR MEDIC CAL ITSELF- BUT ALSO FOR OTHER SERVICES THAT EIGHT THAT THE DEDICATION REYES MAY RECEIVE. AS WELL SO-IT SO I DON'T KNOW THAT SOUNDS OVERLY AMBITIOUS BUT- I THINK THAT'S- WOULD LIKE TO GET SOME FEEDBACK AS TO HOW WE GO ABOUT DOING THAT AND WHAT THE PLANS MIGHT BE. TEMPTED TO ACHIEVE THOSE THINGS. SO DO YOU HAVE ANY. THAT LOOTING AND WHAT ELSE IS IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SECRETLY ATTENDING OUR MEETING SENATOR. HE WHAT YOU EVERYTHING THAT YOU JUST RAN THROUGH IS ACTUALLY RIGHT IN LINE WITH OUR WE ARE DEVELOPING SYSTEMS NEW SYSTEMS AT DH CS- WE ARE THERE IS A REQUIREMENT- IN ESSENCE FROM CMS. THAT WE BUILD MODULAR BUT THAT'S IT THE NATURE AND THE CORE OF OUR WE ARE BUILDING SYSTEM THESE DAYS THESE DAYS FOR GOOD REASON ALL EVERYTHING THAT YOU MENTIONED NOT JUST BECAUSE CMS THINGS THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING AND SO. YEAH EVERYTHING THAT YOU MENTIONED IS THE APPROACH THAT WE'RE USING WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THIS APPROACH THROUGH THE FEDERAL DRAWING REPORTING PROJECT- THAT'S COMING TO A CLOSE THIS JUNE. WE TAKE NOT ONLY IN APPROACH TO DELIVERING- THE SYSTEMS AND MODULES OR COMPONENTS OR SERVICES- WHICHEVER WORDS WE WANT TO USE BUT WE ALSO TAKE AN APPROACH TO DELIVER EARLY AND OFTEN. WE WANT TO GET THE SYSTEMS AND THE FUNCTIONALITY AND OUR PROGRAMS HANDS AVAILABLE FOR YOU SO THAT WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF BUILDING THOSE SYSTEMS THAT'S THE AGILE APPROACH THAT THAT LAURIE MENTIONED WHEN SHE WAS SPEAKING- AND- AND WE DO THAT SO THAT WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB AND EVOLVE IT TO YOUR POINT- WITHOUT A DOUBT. WE TAKE EVERY APPROACH THAT WE CAN AND WE'RE BUILDING THE SYSTEMS TO MAKE THEM ABLE TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE FOR THE FUTURE- SO WERE WERE RIGHT IN LINE WITH. WHAT YOU SAID THAT IS PART OF OUR CURRENT APPROACH AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE PART OF OUR APPROACH GOING FORWARD. OKAY EVERY SHEET THAT- I WAS HAVE NOT BEEN SECRETLY ATTENDING YOUR MEETINGS- I GUESS. TWELVE TWELVE YEAH. A CERTAIN SUBCOMMITTEE FOR WELL AT LEAST ME SOME INSIGHT- YES- BUT IT IT AGAIN IT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DO HAVE SOME REPORTING BACK LANGUAGE- AS THE L. A. O. SUGGESTED SO THAT. YOU CAN AT PRESENT- TO US AT LEAST WHAT THE LATEST THINKING IS AND WHAT. IT AND ALSO WHAT. IS WORK ON IT AND I'M SURE THERE'S GOING TO BE ADDITIONAL ASKS AND LARGER ASKS FOR IT MODERNIZATION. THAT THAT WILL HELP- I GUESS- CONTINUE TO BUILD CONFIDENCE IN THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND THAT- AS WE MAKE- CENTURIES VERY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS AND- IT INFRASTRUCTURE- TWO TWO AGAIN THE THAT THE OUTCOME OF IMPROVING. THE QUALITY OF SERVICE AND- ANDERSON FISSION SEE UP IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM SO AGAIN PRECIADO- BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME CELLS MUCH AS I MAY SEEM LIKE I'M SECRETLY ATTENDING MEETINGS ACTUALLY NEED SOME REPORTS BACK. I KNOW WHAT YOU REALLY GOING ON AND STUFF. AND JUST SO YOU KNOW SENATOR- WE'VE PROVIDED QUARTERLY BRIEFING TODAY- AND WE IN THAT BRIEF SCENE WE PROVIDE AN OVERALL VIEW OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON SO WHILE WE HAVEN'T SORT OF DELIVERED THE OFFICIAL MUSIC CAN ROAD MAP AND- WHERE WE'RE GOING. NUMBER WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE LIKE THE SYSTEMS BASED UPON NEEDS WE PROVIDE THAT MU IN THE BRIEFINGS TODAY AND WE WILL AND WE INTEND TO- BE PROVIDED IT- AND SO THAT'S WHY WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SUFFICIENT LANGUAGE IN PLACE ARE ON THAT- PLUS IT'S JUST PART OF OUR APPROACH- AND THEN THE- PART THAT I. JUST WANT TO BE. ON IN TERMS OF THE DOLLARS IN THE B. C. IS. TO THREE FOUR OF THE DOLLARS THAT ARE IN THIS ONE ARE ACTUALLY ABOUT DELIVERING- THAT SYSTEMS AND PRODUCT. IT'S A SMALL IT'S THE SMALLER PORTION THAT'S RELATED TO THE ACTUAL STRATEGY AND DELIVERY AND THAT'S A PART OF IT RIGHT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DELIVERING NOT JUST WORKING ON. THE ROAD CHEN STRATEGY AND SUCH OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT OKAY THANK YOU. RIGHT ANYTHING ELSE ON ITEM ELEVEN. ANY FINAL CUT X. P. L. A. O. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. NO NO INTERESTING OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT LET'S MOVE ON THE ISSUE TWELVE IN DATA ANALYTICS MANAGEMENT SUPPORT. GREAT THANK YOU. THE EXPANSIVE REQUESTING THIRTEEN PERMANENT POSITIONS AND FUNDING FOR LIMITED TERM RESOURCES FOR AN EXPENDITURE FORTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. WITH A THREE POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND. YES HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATING DATA ANALYTICS MANAGEMENT PROVISIONING REPORTING ACTIVITIES IN ORDER TO IMPROVE DATA LITERACY AND DATA DRIVEN DECISION MAKING NECESSARY TO SUPPORT BUSINESS PROGRAMS AND EVENTS. THE PROPOSAL SUPPORT EXPERIENCE DEPARTMENTAL PROGRAMS THAT HAVE KNOWN GAPS IN DATA LITERACY IN ANALYTICS AND INCREASES CAPACITY RELATED TO DATA TRANSPARENCY IN COORDINATION. DATA VISUALIZATION REPORTING AND ANALYTICAL SUPPORT IN DATA ANALYTICS AND MANAGEMENT WE'RE HAPPY TO DEFINITIONAL QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU AYE FINANCE. OF FORMER IRVINE- THE HOBBIT OKAY HELLO. BECAUSE MORE THAN L. A. NO OF THIS ALL RIGHT OKAY AND THE SO CERTAIN- THANK YOU AGAIN APPRECIATE PRESENTATION I HAVING US FOR LIKE THE PART HEALTHCARE SO- DATA ANALYTICS AND VISUALIZATION OF THINGS WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO HELP SUPPORT THE- STAFF AND HELPING THEM- YOU KNOW MAKE MAKE GOOD DECISIONS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE SYSTEM. YOU YOU DID MENTION THERE UP THERE ARE CERTAIN AREAS IN THE EIGHTY S. THAT HAS A PARTICULAR NEED FOR THESE SERVICES THAT THIS- PROPOSAL WOULD HELP- CAN YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT- WHICH AREAS ARE IN AND DHS- WOULD PARTICULARLY BENEFIT FROM- THAT FROM FROM FROM THIS. NEW STAFF IN THE WORK THAT THEY WOULD BE DOING. YES I BELIEVE WE HAVE BILL HEINRICH. ON THE PHONE THAT CAN AFFECT OKAY TRANSPARENCY GAP ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. SURE THANKS FOR THE QUESTION DOCTOR PANEL- WE DO OR SEEN INCREASE AND- THE WAY MEDIKAL IS RUN BEING MORE DATA DRIVEN YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT JUST PAYING CLAIMS ANYMORE. AND THE NEED FOR DATA EXTERNALLY AND INTERNALLY TO HELP US RUN THE PROGRAM HAS GROWN AND- AND WILL CONTINUE TO GROW- WHEN WE LOOK AT TRENDS IN HEALTHCARE. SO SPECIFIC AREAS ARE PROGRAM AREAS CERTAINLY IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH- IN PROVIDER AREAS PROVIDER ADEQUACY. THOSE ARE SOME EXAMPLES WHERE- THE DATA NEED HAS GROWN. OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT- SO WHAT IT IS I GUESS A COUPLE OBSERVATIONS THE FIRST OF COURSE- NICKNAMES I THINK DHS'S A DATA RICH AGENCY THERE'S A LOT OF DATA COLLECTED BY DATA ISN'T VERY HELPFUL MUCH YOU COULD TURN INTO INFORMATION RIGHT SO SOMETHING COULD ACT ON. SO YOU CAN HAVE A WHOLE HUGE POOL OF DATA THAT SOMEONE ISN'T DOING ANALYTICS ISN'T ABLE TO PROCESS IT IT DOESN'T BECOME VERY HELPFUL FOR DECISION MAKING SO THAT'S- SO CERTAINLY AGREE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THE KIND OF FUNCTIONS ARE DESCRIBED IN THIS PROPOSAL. THE I THINK YOU KNOW SOME OF THE AREAS THAT. CAN BE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IS FOR EXAMPLE BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND LIKE- YOU KNOW RISK POOLS OF AND HAVE IS WE'RE DOING TO PROCUREMENT SO WHAT IT WHAT EXACTLY IS THE ACTUAL. DENNIS LYING- YOU KNOW- THE RISK. AND VARIABILITY THAT OF- IN TERMS OF- NEED- THAT- ARE VARIOUS PLANS AND SO FORTH THEY'RE HAVING CONTRACTS WITH THAT THEY'RE FACING AND SO FORTH ENSURED THAT THE PEOPLE OF THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO PROVIDE THE CARE THEY NEED- SO WELL THEY'RE BEARING RISK WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OF RISK THEY ACTUAR BEARING SO THAT WE CAN MAKE BETTER CONTRACTS- AND ALSO. I THINK RISK ADJUSTMENTS CAN BE CRITICAL TO BE SURE WE ALLOCATE- MEDICARE FUNDS- YOU KNOW THE MOST APPROPRIATELY AS WE HAVE IS BASICALLY OPERATING THROUGH OF A YOU KNOW A LARGE NUMBER OF MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PLANS- AND THEN ALSO TO DRESS EQUITY AS WELL- SO. THAT'S WHICH SOMETIMES ISN'T ALWAYS CAPTURED BY A RISK ADJUSTMENT SO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE EQUITY MEASURES AS WELL SO THAT POINT OUT THAT SOMEONE'S DIABETES. LIVES IN ONE NEIGHBORHOOD MAY NEED FEWER RESOURCES ON DIABETES ANOTHER ONE JUST BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE COMMUNITY RESOURCES AND THAT BECOMES AN EQUITY ISSUE AS WELL- SO HOPEFULLY- THE. THIS- THE YOU CAN HELP OUT AND HELP SUPPORT- THE MEMBERS OF STAFF WHO ARE DOING THIS KIND OF WORK- THAT IS WELL SO. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT SOUND THAT THAT IT. IS THAT. WITH ONE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT THIS GROUP WOULD BE DOING OUR MY OFF BRACE ON THAT. YOU'RE RIGHT ON- EQUITY AND- AND THOSE OTHER ISSUES ARE HIGH PRIORITIES FOR THE DEPARTMENT.
