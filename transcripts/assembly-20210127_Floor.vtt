SIBLING RIVALRY. WE'VE NEVER

00:56:55.612 --> 00:56:57.113
HAD A FIGHT AGAINST EACH OTHER

00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:57.947
IN TERMS OF WORKING AGAINST

00:56:58.014 --> 00:56:59.849

00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:01.518

THIS IS A BEEN A- A JOURNEY FOR

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:10.927
ME AND WHEN I REFLECT BACK ON

00:57:10.994 --> 00:57:12.962
MY YEARS OF LIFE. AND WHERE I

00:57:13.029 --> 00:57:16.599
BEGAN SOME OF YOU MENTIONED. WE

00:57:16.666 --> 00:57:17.133
WERE SHARECROPPERS IN HOPE

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:20.770
ARKANSAS. WE OWN THE LAND BUT

00:57:20.837 --> 00:57:23.039
RACISM DEMANDED THAT MY FATHER

00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:24.374
AND HIS BROTHERS WORK THE WHITE

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:26.442
MAN'S PROPERTY FIRST BEFORE

00:57:26.509 --> 00:57:28.411
THEY COULD EVER WORK THEIR OWN

00:57:28.478 --> 00:57:30.680
OR EVEN HARVEST THEIR CROP.

00:57:30.747 --> 00:57:31.214
WHAT AN UNFAIR AND UNJUST

00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:34.083
SYSTEM. AND MY FATHER WAS ONE

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.651
WHO ALWAYS STOOD UP FOR WHAT

00:57:34.717 --> 00:57:37.854
WAS RIGHT. HE WAS HE WAS ALWAYS

00:57:37.921 --> 00:57:38.454
CONCERNED THAT HE HAD TO HAVE

00:57:38.521 --> 00:57:41.024
DIGNITY. AND SO HE FOUGHT BACK

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:43.493
AT THE WAY STATION IN AUGUST OF

00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:46.429
NINETEEN FIFTY ONE. FOUGHT BACK.

00:57:46.496 --> 00:57:47.630
AND THEY HAD DETERMINED THAT HE

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:49.232
WAS TOO DANGEROUS TO BE AROUND

00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:51.000
EVERYBODY ELSE SO THEY WERE

00:57:51.067 --> 00:57:53.636
GOING TO KILL HIM. AND SO IN

00:57:53.703 --> 00:57:55.371
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. WAS

00:57:55.438 --> 00:57:57.407
PUT IN THE BACK OF THE WAGON.

00:57:57.473 --> 00:57:59.042
AND TAKEN FROM HOPE ARKANSAS

00:57:59.108 --> 00:58:00.844
THE TEXARKANA. AND PUT ON A

00:58:00.910 --> 00:58:03.613
TRAIN TO COME TO CALIFORNIA

00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:04.180
WHERE MY MOTHER'S MOTHER HAD

00:58:04.247 --> 00:58:05.915
COME YEARS BEFORE. HE COULD

00:58:05.982 --> 00:58:08.585
BARELY READ. BECAUSE IT WOULD

00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:09.185
NOT ALLOW HIM TO GO TO SCHOOL

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:10.987
BEYOND THE FIFTH GRADE. HE WAS

00:58:11.054 --> 00:58:13.189
IN A ONE ROOM SCHOOL HOUSE. AND

00:58:13.256 --> 00:58:15.124
WE LIVE IN A ONE ROOM HOUSE.

00:58:15.191 --> 00:58:17.694
HAD NO RUNNING WATER. A

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.194
CLAPBOARD HOUSE IN HOPE

00:58:18.261 --> 00:58:20.730
ARKANSAS. AND SO MY FATHER CAME

00:58:20.797 --> 00:58:22.866
TO CALIFORNIA DETERMINES TO

00:58:22.932 --> 00:58:24.133
BRING HIS CHILDREN TO A GREAT A

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:27.103
LAND OF OPPORTUNITY. UNTIL FOUR

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:27.670
MONTHS LATER WE ALL GOT ON A

00:58:27.737 --> 00:58:30.340
TRAIN. IN HOPE ARKANSAS WE FLAT

00:58:30.406 --> 00:58:31.474
ALSO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

00:58:31.541 --> 00:58:33.276
BECAUSE THEY WOULD HOLD YOU

00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:33.877
ACCOUNTABLE FOR ANY DEBT THAT

00:58:33.943 --> 00:58:35.678
ANYBODY HAD. WE CAME TO

00:58:35.745 --> 00:58:38.081
CALIFORNIA. IN NINETEEN FIFTY

00:58:38.147 --> 00:58:39.649
ONE. I WAS THE BABY OF THE

00:58:39.716 --> 00:58:41.150
FAMILY. I DON'T REMEMBER ALL

00:58:41.217 --> 00:58:42.852
THE RIDES WITH MY SISTERS AND

00:58:42.919 --> 00:58:44.621
BROTHERS OF TOLD ME ABOUT IT.

00:58:44.687 --> 00:58:45.889
AND SO WE CAME TO CALIFORNIA

00:58:45.955 --> 00:58:46.923
EVENTUALLY WHO LIVED IN THE

00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:48.858
PROJECTS THE PUEBLOS ARE BEING

00:58:48.925 --> 00:58:49.525
BUILT THOSE OF YOU WHO LIVE IN

00:58:49.592 --> 00:58:51.427
LOS ANGELES. AND WE LIVE IN THE

00:58:51.494 --> 00:58:54.163
PROBLEMS. AND MY FATHER WORKED

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:56.165
VERY HARD. FOR ALL OF US BUT HE

00:58:56.232 --> 00:58:57.367
ALWAYS TOLD US SOME THINGS THAT

00:58:57.433 --> 00:58:59.602
WERE VERY IMPORTANT. ONE THAT

00:58:59.669 --> 00:59:00.803
WE MUST GET IN EDUCATION

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:02.739
BECAUSE HE WAS DENIED. AND HE

00:59:02.805 --> 00:59:04.107
SAID IF YOU GET AN EDUCATION

00:59:04.173 --> 00:59:05.508
THAT IS THE ONE THING IN THIS

00:59:05.575 --> 00:59:06.943
WORLD THAT THAT THE RACISM

00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:08.978
COULD NOT TAKE FROM YOU. YOU

00:59:09.045 --> 00:59:10.580
WILL ALWAYS HAVE THAT TO

00:59:10.647 --> 00:59:12.615
BASICALLY FASTEN YOUR LIFE. AND

00:59:12.682 --> 00:59:13.950
THE SECOND THING HE SAID AS HE

00:59:14.017 --> 00:59:15.885
WAS ALWAYS VOTE. YOU MUST

00:59:15.952 --> 00:59:17.820
ALWAYS VOTE BECAUSE HE NEVER

00:59:17.887 --> 00:59:18.655
HAD A CHANCE TO VOTE IN HOPE

00:59:18.721 --> 00:59:20.790
ARKANSAS. AND MY GRANDPARENTS

00:59:20.857 --> 00:59:22.258
MY PUT A PATERNAL GRANDPARENTS

00:59:22.325 --> 00:59:24.327
IN ARKANSAS. NEVER GOT A CHANCE

00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:27.263
TO VOTE IN THEIR INTOLERANCE.

00:59:27.330 --> 00:59:28.264
BECAUSE THEY DIED BEFORE

00:59:28.331 --> 00:59:29.866
NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. AND SO

00:59:29.933 --> 00:59:30.900
THAT BECAME A PART OF OUR

00:59:30.967 --> 00:59:33.202
MANTRA IN HER FAMILY. WE MUST

00:59:33.269 --> 00:59:35.505
VOTE WE MUST GO TO SCHOOL. AND

00:59:35.571 --> 00:59:37.273
WE MUST MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:39.242
I AM SO PROUD OF WHAT MY FATHER

00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:40.176
DID FOR ME EVERY STEP OF THE

00:59:40.243 --> 00:59:42.545
WAY. AND HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF

00:59:42.612 --> 00:59:45.548
THE GLORIES OF CALIFORNIA. HARD

00:59:45.615 --> 00:59:47.250
WORKING JOBS MAKING ENDS MEET.

00:59:47.317 --> 00:59:49.252
SENDING HIS KIDS TO SCHOOL.

00:59:49.319 --> 00:59:50.453
MAKING SURE HIS ONE DAUGHTER

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:52.322
WHO REALLY WANTED IN EDUCATION

00:59:52.388 --> 00:59:54.557
AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL GOT IT. SO

00:59:54.624 --> 00:59:56.793
WHEN I SAID TO HIM DADDY THEY

00:59:56.859 --> 00:59:58.294
WANT ME TO GET A PHD. THE

00:59:58.361 --> 01:00:01.264
QUESTION WAS WHAT IS THE ACT.

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:02.832
AND I SAID WELL IT'S A LOT MORE

01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:04.701
SCHOOLING BUT IT'S A HIGHEST

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:07.270
DEGREE YOU CAN GET. HIS

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:10.173
RESPONSE WAS LET US GO GET IT.

01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:10.807
WHICH MEANT HE WOULD BE WITH ME

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:13.142
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. AND SO I

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:14.377
STAND BEFORE YOU AS A CHILD OF

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:18.181
A- SHARECROPPING FAMILY LIVING

01:00:18.247 --> 01:00:19.983
IN A COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE

01:00:20.049 --> 01:00:20.516
CARED SO DEEPLY FOR THEIR

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:22.752
CHILDREN. GOING TO A CHURCH

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:24.287
THAT FOLLOWED ME EVERY STEP OF

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:25.221
THE WAY AND MANY OF THEM ARE

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:27.256
LOOKING AT THIS RIGHT NOW THE

01:00:27.323 --> 01:00:28.791
FEDERAL CHURCH OF CHRIST.

01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:30.460
BECAUSE THEY PRAY FOR ME THEY

01:00:30.526 --> 01:00:31.894
BELIEVE IN ME. AND I HAVE A

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:33.730
RESPONSIBILITY AS OF OLD ALWAYS

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:35.498
TALK TO WHOM MUCH IS GIVEN MUCH

01:00:35.565 --> 01:00:37.600
IS REQUIRED. AND THAT I HAD TO

01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:39.035
BASICALLY DO THE HARD WORK TO

01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:41.270
MAKE THINGS HAPPEN. AND SO WHEN

01:00:41.337 --> 01:00:42.605
I CAME HERE TRYING TO FIGURE

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:44.474
OUT WHAT MY TO DO THIS WAS IT.

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:45.808
AND SO I HAD NO AND I HAVE

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:47.377
EVERY INTENTIONS OF RETIRING

01:00:47.443 --> 01:00:49.545
FROM THIS BODIES. IN THREE AND

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:52.281
A HALF MORE YEARS. AND MOVING

01:00:52.348 --> 01:00:54.517
ON TO GRANDPARENTS WHO WERE I

01:00:54.584 --> 01:00:56.052
COULD PLAY WITH MY GRANDKIDS

01:00:56.119 --> 01:00:56.586
AND DO THOSE KINDS OF FUN

01:00:56.652 --> 01:00:58.688
THINGS. AND WHEN I WAS TAPPED

01:00:58.755 --> 01:01:00.456
ON THE SHOULDER TO CONSIDER

01:01:00.523 --> 01:01:02.492
SECRETARY OF STATE. LIKE MOST

01:01:02.558 --> 01:01:04.694
OF YOU I WAS SHOCKED. I KNOW

01:01:04.761 --> 01:01:06.295
BUT NO AND I HAD NOT THOUGHT

01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:08.164
THAT PEOPLE WERE WATCHING.

01:01:08.231 --> 01:01:10.266
THINK WHY WAS. BELIEVING THAT I

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.667
COULD DO THINGS THAT SOMETIMES

01:01:11.734 --> 01:01:13.669
I DIDN'T KNOW I COULD. AND SO

01:01:13.736 --> 01:01:16.439
AS A RESULT OF THAT. A MUCH

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.574
HARD THINKING AND LONG THOUGHT

01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:20.943
I AGREE TO DO THE TEST. BECAUSE

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:23.546
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WORK.

01:01:23.613 --> 01:01:24.180
WHEN A CRISIS RIGHT NOW IN THIS

01:01:24.247 --> 01:01:26.249
NATION. OUR DEMOCRACY IS SO

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:28.718
FRAGILE AND PEOPLE HAVE SUCH

01:01:28.785 --> 01:01:31.020
MISINFORMATION. AND THE

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:32.055
GREATNESS OF THIS NATION THAT

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:33.589
WE HAVE TAKEN IT FOR GRANTED

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:35.124
FOR SO LONG IS NOW BEING

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:38.594
CHALLENGED. CAN WE SURVIVE IT

01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:39.695
CAN WE REALLY GET BACK TO THE

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:41.697
PRINCIPLES WHERE EVERYONE IS AN

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:43.566
IMPORTANT AND EVERY VOTE COUNTS

01:01:43.633 --> 01:01:45.334
AND EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO BE

01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:47.370
HEARD BUT NOT TO BE HEARD. AND

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:49.605
WE HAVE A CHALLENGE TO DO THAT.

01:01:49.672 --> 01:01:50.773
AND NO MATTER WHAT WE HAVE DONE

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:52.475
IN THE PAST THAT IS OUR MISSION

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:55.011
AT THIS POINT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:01:55.078 --> 01:01:56.913
THIS SMART DEMOCRACY SURVIVES.

01:01:56.979 --> 01:01:58.414
I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH FEAR IN

01:01:58.481 --> 01:02:00.450
ELECTIONS AS I'VE SEEN THIS

01:02:00.516 --> 01:02:02.552
PAST YEAR. AND I'VE BEEN AROUND

01:02:02.618 --> 01:02:03.286
THE WORLD AND I'VE SEEN

01:02:03.352 --> 01:02:04.620
COUNTRIES WITH CAN READ HAVE A

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:07.223
LEXINGTON EVERYBODY IS NERVOUS.

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:09.559
EVERYBODY'S CONCERNED ABOUT

01:02:09.625 --> 01:02:11.227
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND NOW

01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:13.329
THAT HAS COME TO US. AND WE

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:14.797
REALIZE THAT WE HAVE A

01:02:14.864 --> 01:02:15.498
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.567
LEGISLATURE. AND AS CITIZENS OF

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:19.936
THE STATE. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:02:20.002 --> 01:02:21.671
PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF EVERYONE

01:02:21.737 --> 01:02:23.172
TO VOTE. AND THAT EVERY VOTE

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:24.907
COUNTS. AND THAT OUR SYSTEM

01:02:24.974 --> 01:02:26.876
ACTUALLY WORKS. AND THEN WE CAN

01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:27.877
BASICALLY BILL FOR THE FIRST

01:02:27.944 --> 01:02:29.812

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:32.515

WORKS TOGETHER AND EVERYONE IS

01:02:33.182 --> 01:02:34.884
RESPECTED. THAT WOULD BE

01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:36.586
UNIQUE. THAT WOULD BE A

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:38.121
CHALLENGE. BUT IT'S ALSO A

01:02:38.187 --> 01:02:39.222
TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY THE

01:02:39.288 --> 01:02:41.324

JUSTICE AND EQUALITY FOR

01:02:52.802 --> 01:02:55.037
EVERYONE. AND IT COMES OUT OF

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:57.206
THE FACT THAT I KNOW WHAT IT'S

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:57.773

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:18.761
KNOW THAT THEIR EFFORTS WILL

01:03:18.828 --> 01:03:20.496
COUNT. THE KNOW THAT THEY WILL

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:22.498
BE VALUED. AND KNOW THAT THEY

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:24.000
