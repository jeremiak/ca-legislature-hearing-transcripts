SOON WE'RE GONNA TAKE A VOTE THAT WILL SIGNAL AN END TO A NEARLY FIVE DECADES OLD CONFLICT. I'M SPEAKING ABOUT THE MEDICAL INJURY COMPENSATION REFORM ACT KNOWN TO ALL OF US AS MICRO. TODAY WILL BE VOTING ON AB THIRTY FIVE WHICH REPRESENTS A RESOLUTION OF ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT ISSUES TO FACE MULTIPLE GENERATIONS OF LAWMAKERS IN THIS BUILDING. AB THIRTY FIVE IS A COMPROMISE IT WILL PROVIDE FAIR AND SENSIBLE COMPENSATION TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE SUFFERED A HEALTH CARE INJURY OR DEATH. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PROVIDING INTO CONTINUED CERTAINTY AND STABILITY FOR MEDICAL PROVIDERS PATIENTS WHILE PROVIDING PROTECTION FOR PHYSICIANS. AB THIRTY FIVE IS AN EXAMPLE THAT THE FIGHTS THAT APPEARED TO BIND US FOR DECADES ARE ONLY AS IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERCOME AS WE ALLOW THEM TO BE. IN TRUTH I HOPE THAT AB THIRTY FIVE BECOMES A ODEL FOR US AS TO WHAT. HOW WE CAN RESOLVE SOME OF OUR FUTURE ISSUES. WHO'S THAT OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS REALLY WORKS WHEN WE ALL GET TOGETHER AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S BEST FOR THE COMMUNITY. AND THE COMMUNITY HAS MANY STAKEHOLDERS AND WHEN YOU GET ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER. AND REACH AN AGREEMENT FAIR AND EQUITABLE. FINALLY I DO WANT TO THANK THE BROAD COALITION OF STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTING PATIENTS. DOCTORS AND THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY FOR FINDING THIS COMPROMISE I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO SUFFERED THE HANDS OF. PHYSICIANS HOSPITALS THANK THEIR FAMILIES FOR THEIR BRAVERY IN COMING FORWARD AND SHARING THEIR STORY THE LAND OF FACE. TO THE TO THE ISSUE. VERY SPECIFICALLY I THINK I WANT TO NOTE. THAT WHEN YOU HAVE THE ENTIRE. LIST OF STAKEHOLDERS SITTING TOGETHER IN THE GALLERY WHEN A MATTER IS GOING TO BE HEARD. YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD DECISION SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MS REYES MEMBERS A- BRIEF REMINDER PLEASE HIT THE MICROPHONE BUTTON ON YOUR DESKS IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE RAISING A MICROPHONE AND SEEKING RECOGNITION I WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE MR FLORA. YOUR RECOGNIZE AT YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY FIVE AND I THINK IT'S A- IT'S A GREAT DAY. THAT'S A GREAT DAY TO GET THIS DONE AND- THE MAJORITY LEADER HANDED A LOT OF WORK. WHEN YOU. THINK ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR FIVE DECADES. AND WHEN INDUSTRIES COME TOGETHER. FIND A SOLUTION THAT ALLOWS ALL OF US TO WORK TOGETHER. IT'S EXCITING IS ACTUALLY WHAT MAKES THIS. DEMOCRACY WORK. IS WHAT MAKES IT FUN. WE DON'T SEE THIS VERY OFTEN SIZE WAS A THANK YOU. TO THE INDUSTRIES THAT WERE INVOLVED. FOR COMING TO THE TABLE. AND PUTTING TOGETHER A QUALITY PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT I'M VERY PROUD TO SUPPORT SOMETHING. THANK YOU MISTER FLORA MISS WALDRON YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MATT MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I TO RISE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF AB THIRTY FIVE MICRO REFORM HAS BEEN LONG DEBATED FOR YEARS AND HAS FINALLY COME TO A COMPROMISE THROUGH COHESIVE LEGISLATION. AB THIRTY FIVE DOES TWO ESSENTIAL THINGS IT EXTENDS THE LONG TERM PREDICTABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY OF STATE LIABILITY PROTECTIONS FOR THOSE PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE IN CALIFORNIA AND IT PROVIDES FAIR AND REASONABLE INCREASES TO LIMITS ON NON ECONOMIC DAMAGES FOR MEDICAL MALPRACTICE STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THIS IS A MONUMENTAL AGREEMENT THAT ENDS A DECADES LONG BATTLE FOUGHT THROUGH EXPENSIVE BALLOT MEASURES COURT ROOMS AND THEN THE LEGISLATURE AB THIRTY FIVE PUTS PATIENTS FIRST WHILE THE PRIORITIZING BEFORE- ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. MEMBERS IT'S A RARE OCCASION WHEN EVERYONE INVOLVED HAS COME TO AN AGREEMENT AND I'M PROUD TO BE A PART OF IT ALONG WITH ALL THE OTHER. CO AUTHORS AND THE AUTHOR THE PATIENTS DOCTORS AND THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY I STRONGLY ASK YOU TO JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING AB THIRTY FIVE BECOMING A PART OF HISTORY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS WALDRON MR COOLEY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. COLLEAGUES I'M PLEASED TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS I JUST WANT TO OFFER SOME BRIEF COMMENTS REGARDING IT. IT IS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE DONE LEGISLATIVE WORK CONTINUOUSLY FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS MY WHOLE FIELD HAS BEEN INSURANCE- WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. THERE WERE TWO PROMINENT TYPES OF LITIGATION AFFECTED THE INSURANCE SECTOR WHAT THE PROPERTY CASUALTY SIDE ON ON THE- HEALTH INSURANCE SIDE DEAL WITH. RACINE LITIGATION MEDICAL MALPRACTICE SIDE HEALTH INSURANCE. INDUSTRY TO STABILIZE THE MARKET. RESERVE THE TYPE A LAWSUIT ALSO COMING OF THAT TIME THAT WAS NOT ADDRESSED. GOSH THE SPAN OF A DECADE CERTAIN INSURANCE COSTS INCREASED ALMOST DOUBLE. VERY REMARKABLE. SO THERE'S TWO THINGS HAPPEN THE SEVENTIES ONE WAS ADDRESSED BY THE MICROSCOPIC VICE. AND BUT YOU SAW THIS EXAMPLE OF HOW THINGS GO THROUGH THE ROOF IT AFFECTS THE COST AND ACCESS WHAT IS STRIKING. AND VERY IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS BILL. IS IT RE OPENS THE ABILITY TO PURSUE ISSUES OF CONTESTED MEDICAL CARE. ARE VERY VERY IMPORTED OPENS THE DOOR FOR THAT SORT OF THING AT THE SAME TIME IT PUT SOME BOUNDARIES ON IT SO IT WILL NOT OVERWHELM THE SYSTEM WITH COSTS SO THIS IS REALLY A TREMENDOUS BREAKTHROUGH COURTHOUSE FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF ACTIONS BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S BALANCED IN A WAY TO PRESERVE LONG TERM ACCES TO MEDICAL CARE WHICH IS ONE OF OUR MOST FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES- IN CALIFORNIA. SO I THINK THIS IS. A VERY VERY STRIKING SOUND INNOVATIVE RESPONSE. TO A PROBLEM. THAT YOU HAD A BAD SOLUTION WOULD ACTUALLY. HURT LONG TERM ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE. I THINK IT IS A- AS I SAY AN EXCELLENT BALANCED RESPONSE INTERGIRO VOTE. THANK YOU MISS COOLEY DOCTOR WOULD YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS SAYS THAT AS SOMEONE WHO PRACTICED DENTISTRY FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS. AND STILL ACTUALLY CARRY MALPRACTICE INSURANCE FOR THE WORK I DO- IN FORENSIC CONSULTING THIS IS HISTORIC- YOU NEED TO DO YOU DO NEED TO REMEMBER AND REFLECT BACK TO NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE WHEN SKYROCKETING MALPRACTICE PREMIUMS WERE THREATENING TO DRIVE PROVIDERS OUT OF THE STATE. AND THIS STABILIZE THAT- AND UNFORTUNATELY SET UP A FORTY SEVEN YEAR BATTLE- TO CHANGE IT I THINK THE CHANGES ARE APPROPRIATE I THINK THEY'RE FAIR THEIR FAIR FOR PATIENCE I THINK THEY'RE FAIR FOR PROVIDERS AND ACTUARIAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN I BELIEVE. IN THE BACKGROUND THAT THIS ISN'T REALLY GOING TO AFFECT THE MALPRACTICE INSURANCE A MARKET VERY MUCH WE'VE GOT OTHER BATTLES WITH INSURANCE RIGHT NOW THAT WE'RE WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH FIRE- FIRE INSURANCE IN PLACES HAS SKYROCKETED- THOSE ARE OTHER THINGS WE NEED TO MEET NEED TO BE LOOKING OUT BECAUSE OF A CRISIS. AND HOW WE RESPOND TO THOSE- WILL- POTENTIALLY BE TIE TACK. AS WE CONTINUE TO FORWARD SO I'M I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS I THINK IT'S A GREAT DEAL FOR CONSUMERS IT'S A GREAT DEAL FOR A MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE. AYE VOTE. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD. THANK WEBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. GOOD MORNING I RISE THIS MORNING AS A PROUD CO AUTHOR BUT I ALSO RISE AS AN OBGYN ONE OF THE MOST LITIGIOUS MEDICAL FEELS THAT WE HAVE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND UNDERSTANDING THAT IF WE DIDN'T GET THIS RIGHT THERE WAS A TRULY A CONCERN. THAT W WOULD LOSE ACCESS BECAUSE WE LOSE PHYSICIANS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I ALSO RISE AS A BLACK WOMAN. AND UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE WHO ARE BEEN WHO HAVE BEEN MOST HARMED FOR MEDICAL MALPRACTICE TO NOT BEING ABLE TO BE COMPENSATED FAIRLY. HAVE BEEN ARE NOT ARE MINORITIES AND ARE FEMALES AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THOSE WHO CAME TO THE TABLE. TO REALLY MAKE THIS HISTORIC DEAL POSSIBLE. SO THAT WE TRULY CAN PROVIDE THE BEST CARE AND THE BEST ACCESS. FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOC WEBER. I SEE NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION ON THE ITEM. BIZRATE'S YOU MAY CLOSE.
