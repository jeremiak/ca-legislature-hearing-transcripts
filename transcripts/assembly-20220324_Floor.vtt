THE RACE GOT HEATED AND IT WAS

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:35.803

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:37.972
SOMETIMES IT GOT A LITTLE UGLY.

01:34:38.039 --> 01:34:39.707

01:34:39.774 --> 01:34:41.442

01:34:50.818 --> 01:34:52.853
UNITES US THAN DIVIDES US. AND

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:54.155
IN THESE MOMENTS OF POLITICAL

01:34:54.221 --> 01:34:55.689
FIGHTS ESPECIALLY WITH DEMOCRAT

01:34:55.756 --> 01:34:56.791

01:34:56.857 --> 01:34:58.225
IMPORTANT FOR US TO REMEMBER

01:34:58.292 --> 01:34:58.959

01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:00.795

TOGETHER. AND I LET MY SUPPORT

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:08.235
WHEN SHE WAS THE ORGANIZING

01:35:08.302 --> 01:35:08.769

AND SO WE DID WORK

01:35:16.811 --> 01:35:19.313
