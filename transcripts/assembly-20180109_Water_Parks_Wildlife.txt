I WILL BEGIN FIRST WITH THEM A ROCA. EDUARDO GARCIA HASN'T. GALLAGHER. BIGELOW. CORREO. CHOI. CHIU. FRIEDMAN. GLORIA. HARPER PRESENT. KALRA. LEVINE. MATHIS. RUBIO. THOUGHTLESS. WOULD GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL. TWO SEVEN TWO WHICH ENCOURAGE THE CONSOLIDATION OF SMALL MINUTES CYBILL WATER SYSTEMS INTO LARGE SYSTEMS TO IMPROVE A WATER SERVICE FOR CALIFORNIANS. I WOULD LIKE TO. THANK THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE CHAIR TO STAFF WORKING ON WITH ME AND MY TEAM ON THIS BILL I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THE ARM AUTHORS. AMENDMENTS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS. MANY RESIDENTS WITHIN THE STATE CURRENTLY RECEIVES THEIR DRINKING WATER OF FROM SMALL PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS THAT LACKS RESOURCES FUNDING FROM LARGE CAPITAL COSTS. AND EVEN ONGOING COST TO MAINTAIN PROM THE PROJECTS THAT THEY HAVE SMALL PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS CANNOT OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES BY CONSOLIDATING. WITH. OTHER SYSTEMS TO AND SHE OF ECONOMY OF SCALE TO PROVIDE WATER SERVICES ONE BAY AREA TO CONSOLIDATION IS THE. COST OF HOLDING A FULL BLOWN ELECTION TO APPROVE THE SALE OF SMALLNESS WILL WATER SYSTEMS UNDER EXISTING LAW. AREN'T EVEN A SMALL CITY. WITH THE WATER SYSTEM THAT. HAVE ONLY TEN ON SERVICE CONNECTIONS WOULD ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A CONSOLIDATION IN THE SYSTEM I'M WITH ANOTHER. AYE ME COMPLETE ELECTION INCLUDES ALL THE REGISTERED VOTERS. OF THE CITY THAT NEEDS TO BE. PART OF THE. OF THE VOTE BEFORE A SOUL OF THE WATER AGENCY IS ACTUALLY COMPLETED WHILE THE COSTS TO HOLD OF AN ELECTION. MAY NOT BE SIX SIGNIFICANT TO LARGE CITIES ARMS SMALLER CITIES HAS AN EXPENSE OF THE TAXPAYERS. AND ALSO THEIR COMMUNITY THIS BILL SEEKS TO MODIFY THE ELECTION REQUIREMENTS AND ALLOWS CITIES. CELL AND CONSOLIDATE THEIR SMALL WATER SYSTEMS IF THE CITY DETERMINES IF AGAIN THE CITY DETERMINES THAT IT IS NOT IN THE. PUBLIC'S BEST INTEREST TO ALL OPERATE A WATER SYSTEM. THIS CHALLENGE WILL PROVIDE MORE. EXCUSE ME THIS CHANGE WILL PROVIDE MORE CALIFORNIANS WERE CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I HERE WITH ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING. TESTIMONIES ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO A SELF INTRODUCED WHO REPRESENTS THE. WILLOW. AGENCY IT ALSO THE CALIFORNIA WATER SO SEE ASIAN. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN. MY NAME IS WAYNE PEABODY. AND WITH THE THE CITY OF WILLOW'S ON THE CITY MANAGER. ALL THE CITY OF WILLOW'S ISN'T GOING COUNTY. WHERE THE POPULATION WILL OVER SIX THOUSAND PEOPLE WE CONSIDERED A DISADVANTAGE COMMUNITY? THE ENTIRE DRINKING WATER SUPPLY IN THE CITY WILLS IS ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE CHROME SIX. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE CITY RESIDENTIAL WATER PROVIDER CALIFORNIA WATER SERVICE COMPANY RECEIVEDA GRANT FROM THE STATE TO INSTALL TREATMENT OF THE CHROME SIX TO ENSURE SAFE CLEAN WATER FOR. TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED HOMES IN THE CITY OF WILLOW'S. IN ADDITION TO THE RESIDENTIAL SERVICE CONNECTIONS THE CITY OF WILLOW'S OWNS AND OPERATES A SMALL NUMBER OF INDUSTRIAL CONNECTIONS OF OUR OWN SYSTEM. BETTER OUTSIDE OF CAO WATER. RATHER THAN RATHER THAN INSTALLING DUPLICATE AND EXPENSIVE TREATMENT WE BELIEVE THE BEST AVENUE FOR THE CITY IN THE CITIZENS OF WILLOW'S IS TO PARTNER WITH CAL WATER. AND HAVE THEM SUPPLY ALL OF THE SYSTEM. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA STATURE REQUIRES THE CITYWIDE VOTER TO PROVE ALL OF THE TRANSACTIONS. WHICH COULD RESULT IN UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OF AN ELECTION COSTS FOR THE CITY. WE BELIEVE THIS IS NOT REASONABLE FOR A LOW INCOME COMMUNITY. WE WHEN THE SALE MAKES COMPLETE SENSE HELPED ENSURE SAFE CLEAN WATER AND DOES NOT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE CITIZENS OF LOS. THE WILL OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT FULLY SUPPORTS AB TWO SEVEN TWO BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE SALE OF OUR WATER SYSTEM IS TECHNICALLY AND FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE. AND HELPS GUARANTEE THE SAFE CLEAN WATER FOR OUR CITIZENS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. ILLEGALLY YES. OF THE A GOOD MORNING A MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ON MY NAME'S JACK HAWKS. SORRY ABOUT MY VOICE. EXECUTIVE RECORD CALIFORNIA WATER SITUATION ARE GROUP. REPRESENTS THE. PUBLIC WATER UTILITIES ARE REGULATED BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE THE BE PART OF THE A WORKING GROUP. THAT IS ASSEMBLYMEMBER A GIPSON PUT TOGETHER. TO. EXAMINE LEGISLATIVE OPTIONS. WITH RESPECT A CONSOLIDATION THAT WOULD. HELP FURTHER THE A HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER LAW. AND AB TWO SEVENTY TWO AS WAS ONE OF THOSE OPTIONS THAT CAME OUT OF THAT. A DISCUSSION GROUP. IN ADDITION TO ALL THE REASONS HE ASSEMBLYMEMBER. GAVE US AS THE RATIONALE FOR THIS BILL. ONE OF THE MORE PRACTICAL OUTCOMES IS THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE MATTER GAINED WHEN A SMALLER SYSTEM THAT IS TROUBLED. EITHER BY A LACK OF RUBBLE THAT RELIABLE WATER SUPPLY WATER CONTAMINATION. LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. LACK OF ABILITY TO HANDLE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. IS. BEING ABLE TO SPREAD THE COST OF SERVICE OF OVER A LARGER CUSTOMER BASE AND. THAT'S WITH THIS BILL WILL HAVE A HELP FACILITATE. YOU'VE GOT PER ONGOING AND NEEDS FOR CONSERVATION OF WATER FOR A AS A SIMPLE STRUCTURE INVESTMENT. A PIPELINE REPLACE A REPLACEMENT. WATER QUALITY OF COMPLIANCE ALL OF THOSE NEEDS ARE GROWING AND. THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE A BENEFITS WILL HELP MITIGATE THE PRESSURE ON RATES THAT. RESULTS FROM A ALL OF THOSE A AND AT NEEDS. THEY BOTH. A GENTLEMAN MENTIONED THE. OF THAT BARRIER HERE THAT'S IN CURRENT STATUTE WITH RESPECT TO THE CITYWIDE ELECTION. YEAH OUR. VIEW IS THAT CITY COUNCIL WHEN IT PASSES A RESOLUTION. THAT STATES INTO THAT IT IS NOT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. TO CONTINUE TO OWN AND OPERATE A WATER SYSTEM. IT'S FAILING. AND THAT CITY COUNCIL REPRESENTS A HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE ELECTORATE. IT DOESN'T IT REALLY OBVIATES THE NEED FOR A CITYWIDE ELECTION ESPECIALLY FOR A COMMUNITY LIKE AT WILLOW'S HER. OR OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE A FEW THOUSAND PEOPLE FOR THE COST OF RUNNING CITYWIDE ELECTION IS IS REAL MONEY IN A GOOD THEY'LL THE OF ITS MONEY THAT CAN BE. A BETTER USE FOR OTHER. OTHER ACTIVITIES. SO WANTED. INSTEAD OF REPEATING WHAT THEY'VE SAID I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE OF WHAT. AB GO TO SEVENTY TWO DOES IT PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE PROCESS. TO SETTLE WATER SYSTEM THAT GIVES THE RESIDENTS OF THE COMMUNITY MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN THAT PROCESS THERE IS STILL A VERY ROBUST. PUBLIC PROCESS INVOLVED HERE. REQUIRES PUBLIC HEARINGS PUBLIC NOTIFICATIONS A PUBLIC MEETING TO ENSURE THAT RESIDENTS ARE INFORMED ABOUT THE STATE OF THE WATER UTILITY. OF THE BILL IS NARROW IN SCOPE AND IT ONLY APPLIES TO SMALL SYSTEMS THAT'S THIRTY THREE HUNDRED SERVICE CONNECTIONS ARE LEFT STORY ARE POPULATION OF A. TEN THOUSAND OR LESS. THAT HAS AN ONGOING PROBLEM WITH DEFERRED MAINTENANCE LACK OF CAPITAL FOR INVESTMENT ALL OF THE AND NEEDS I MENTIONED EARLIER. IT PROTECTS CUSTOMERS BY ENSURING THAT THE ACQUIRED WATER SYSTEMS CUSTOMERS DO NOT PAY WATER RATES. THAT ARE HIGHER THAN THOSE OF THE CUSTOMERS OF THE WIRING SYSTEM. SO THEY'LL BE ALTOGETHER. THAT'S IMPORTANT A CONSIDERATION. OF BUILT REQUIRES TWENTY FIVE PERCENT THE RESIDENTS OF THE COMMUNITY TO OPPOSE THE SALE. OF THE SYSTEM TO OVERTURN THE CITY COUNCIL'S RESOLUTION AND CONTRAST AS YOU KNOW PROP TWO EIGHTEEN. REQUIRES A FIFTY PERCENT. OPPOSITION TO A A PROPOSED RATE INCREASE. EQUALLY SIGNIFICANT THE BILL DOES NOT MANDATE ANYTHING IT MERELY FACILITATES BUT VOLUNTARY CONSOLIDATION. WHERE THERE ARE WILLING PARTIES THE BILL DOES NOT DECREASE TRANSPARENCY IN FACT IT PROVIDES MORE OPPORTUNITIES AS I AM MENTION FOR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT? THAN THE CURRENT LAW DOES. AND FINALLY THE BILL DOES NOT SUPERSEDE THE AUTHORITY OF LOCAL AGENCY FORMATION COMMISSIONS. OR THAT IN MY CASE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THEIR AUTHORITY TO APPROVE CONSOLIDATIONS. SO I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON AB TWO SEVENTY TWO I THINK IT'S ANOTHER ARROW. IN THE QUIVER FOR. CONTINUE THE MOMENTUM ON. IMPROVE AND ON STRENGTHENING THE A HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER LAW THANK AS OUR GUEST. IS MOTION COULD HAVE A SECOND. I'LL OPEN IT UP ANYONE WANT TO SPEAK IN FAVOR JUST YOUR NAME IN. YOUR POSITION. MORRELL JAKE. PREVENT ME TO SEVENTY TWO THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. BOB NICHOLS THAT I WAS THING DEBORAH VALLEY WATER COMPANY IS CPUC REGULATED UTILITY AND. LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND WE SUPPORT THE BILL AND JUST BRIEFLY I WANT TO SAY WE. HAD EXPERIENCE WITH THE CITY MONTEBELLO THINK REPRESENTATIVE THE CITY. HAD WANTED BE UP HERE WITH THE WEATHER WASN'T ABLE TO MAKE IT BUT. DIDN'T EXPERIENCE THERE WERE THE. CITY. SERVED BY FIVE DIFFERENT WATER SYSTEMS ONE TO SELL THAT THE PORTION OF WITH THE SYSTEM SERVING PORTION OF THE CITY THAT IT OWNS. BECAUSE. THAT THE RATES WERE HIGH BE. BACKLOG OF NEEDED REPAIRS WAS. BIT DAUNTING FOR THEM. IT IN A LIGHT TURNOUT ELECTION THE. IT LOST BY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY VOTES EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NO. OPPOSITION TO IT. AND AND IT JUST. DOES A LOT OF TIME EFFORT MONEY SPENT BY THE CITY ON SOMETHING. THEY THEY ARE STILL HAVING TROUBLE WITH THIS WATER SYSTEM. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW A SITUATION LIKE THAT TO. BE ALLEVIATED. THANK YOU ANYONE WISHING TO. SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SEEN NO ONE. UP THERE IS A MOTION A SECOND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS CHAIR WAS ONE THE STATE'S A COMMITTEE WITH RESPECT LAST LIGHTEN THEM SIDE. MAYBE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU I THINK WHILE HELPING. YES SIR I APOLOGIZE PERSONAL PROBLEM THANK CHAIRMAN I WOULD I WOULD JUST ASK. WILL ANY OF THE WITNESSES AND AUTHOR. THE LAST PUBLIC SPEAKER GOT TO THIS HELP HOW MUCH OF A PROBLEM IS THIS WE HAVE FREQUENTLY R. THINGS PUT TO VOTES AND THEY FAIL. MAKE THE THINGS THAT SEEMS TO BE OF VALUE OUT OF THIS TICKET LEGISLATION IS TO. YOU PROVIDE THAT TO ELECT DECISION MAKERS WHICH I CAN UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT TO PUBLIC SUPPORT. UMP KIND UNDERSTAND HOW BIG A PROBLEM SINCE. SOLID STATE. THERE WERE A COUPLE OF RECENT. IT RECENTLY THAT HAVE A FAILED THERE I BELIEVE THEY'RE ABOUT NINETY. ATTENTIONAL. OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THIS BILL AT LEAST THEY'RE NOT EVEN NOTIFIED DEFINED IN THE PARAMETERS THAT WILL HAVE A RIGHT AND THOUSAND THAT'S ON SO FORTH. WITH NO SENSE OF THE SCOPE OF HOW MANY ACTUALLY WANT TO SELL ARE KIND OF THE DIRE STRAITS YOU'RE DESCRIBING IT NO EXTENT DEBATE IT'S ATTEMPTED AND FAILED AT THE BALLOT RIGHT IT'S EVEN DIFFICULT FOR US TO. ASCERTAIN THAT BECAUSE. BECAUSE THERE'S SOME OF THE CITIES ARE. ARE INTIMIDATED BY THE LAW AND BILL IN MAY AND MAY NOT EVEN WANT TO MOVE. FORWARD BECAUSE I KNOW. YOU KNOW WHAT HURDLE LITTLE BEES SO WE'RE ACTUALLY NOT SURE. ON THAT WE'VE WE'VE DONE A LITTLE RESEARCH TRY TO FIGURE THAT QUESTION NOW. PIPE AYE. I BELIEVE IT WILL IF THIS BILL PASSES WILL BE. OF THE BEING OF A A SIGNIFICANT UPTICK. IN THOSE A LOT OF CONSOLIDATION LIKE I THINK IT WOULD STRAIN THE CASE FOR THE LEGISLATION IF THERE WERE MORE NUMBERS ATTACHED TO. HOW FREQUENTLY THESE IMPOVERISHED AND AND DIFFICULT WATER SYSTEMS ARE UNABLE TO SO TO SEEK THE RELIEF THAT UNDERSTANDS FROM THE COUNTY TO SKILLED DOCTOR WAS TALKING ABOUT? YOU KNOW I'M HAPPIEST WITH THE BILL THE DAVE I THINK THAT WOULD STRENGTHEN THE CASE FOR UNDERSTANDING WHAT PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE HOW SIGNIFICANT PALM THAT REALLY IS. THE OTHER QUESTION IS I GENERALLY HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT EVER. A POTENTIALLY SIGNED OFF PUBLIC ASSETS I'M NOT DON'T BELIEVE THIS BILL SPEAKS TO A PROHIBITION TO SELLING TO PRIVATE ENTITIES THIS IS SIMPLY GOING TO OTHER. PUBLIC AGENCIES RIGHT THANKS TO ITS NOT LET'S. IT'S ANYBODY IT'S ANY NEIGHBORING SYSTEM NAMING SYSTEM PUBLIC SYSTEM I'D ANY THE WATERS IT WHAT COMMUNITY YOU CAN BE BETWEEN EITHER BY. THE BEYOND ALSO YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE IS THIS BILL WOULD FACILITATE THE% SALE OF PUBLIC ASSETS TO PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS OR. THE PUBLIC WILL HIT A RECORD OF THE GOVERNMENT OWNS IT AS WELL. AND I THINK THAT ALSO PROBABLY REQUIRE STATUS OF DIGITAL VETTING PARTICULARLY. NAVICULAR MY OWN CITY THESE ARE TYPICALLY PRETTY GOOD JOBS. THAT. YOU KNOW FOLKS ARE USUALLY PRE HAVE ABOUT MAYBE NOT SO MUCH IN THE CASE OF THE SMALL JURISDICTIONS THEIR PROPS TEETERING ON FINANCIAL. SPORTIMES BUT NOT UNDERSTANDING THAT AGAIN AND UNDERSERVED OUTSTANDING WHAT PRIVATIZATION MAY MEAN. MOST MYSPACE WITHOUT ARE NOT FAVORABLE. AND. ANY KIND BILL TO LOOK FACILITATE THAT IN A NEGATIVE WAY YOU KNOW I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHEN BY MORE ABOUT THAT IN THE PURPOSES OF TODAY'S CONVERSATIONS CHAIRMAN I'M HAVE TO FOLLOW THE RECOMMENDATION. APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WORK ON THIS IN WHICH IS MAKE A PLEA FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE VERY CLEAR. I DON'T KNOW. WHAT THE OFFICIALS MAKING THE DECISION THEY GENERALLY MAKE MOST DECISIONS ANYWAY? AND AT THAT THE LANGUAGE THAT I THINK YOU'RE COMMITTEE PERFORMS CHAIRMAN OF ABOUT YOU KNOW SORT UNCLEAR ABOUT PUBLIC MEETING THAT EARLY FOR. OUR FOLKS TO COME AND MAKE THE COMMENTS KNOWN ABBAS AND FEW THOSE HEARINGS OVER THE YEARS THEIR THEIR. THE PRINT SHALLOW GENE I'M SO TAKE TO SUGGEST THAT SOMEHOW LOW IN THE BOTTOM SO I MEAN AT LEAST OR SOMETHING BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND AN ASSET YOU ARE EVEN KNOW WHAT THE CITY OF WILLOW'S WOULD GET. FOR SOMETHING THAT'S UNDER WATER AND AND NOT NO PUN INTENDED UP BUT BUT BUT IT ALMOST FEELS LIKE YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE AND AND HAVING TO DEFEND YOUR GENERAL FUND CONSTANTLY. TO PULL OUT WHEN YOU SHOULD HAVE UNITS YOU HAVE I SUSPECT YOU HAVE A. OF FUND ALREADY FOR YOUR WATER PLANT AND NOW YOU HAVE TO DIP INTO THAT. RAISING THE RATES. ARE ALWAYS A CHALLENGE AND AND I ALSO DO. UNDERSTAND THAT THE CHALLENGES OF A CITY. AREN'T TAKING SOMETHING LIKE THIS TO THE BALLOT BECAUSE YOU CAN'T REALLY CAMPAIGNED FOR YOUR CASE. SO THAT BECOMES AT BECOMES ANOTHER PROBLEM SO THE FACT THAT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. PROTESTS COULD OVERTURN THIS I THINK IS SIGNIFICANT I THINK THAT'S A POINT THAT'S ONLY A POINT IN YOUR FAVOR. AND SO. BUT I I AM CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW IF WILLOW'S WERE TO SELL OFF THEIR ASSET YOU KNOW. IS IT A ZERO SUM GAME OR ARE YOU OR DOES THE CITY ACTUALLY. GET OUT AT THE STAND TO GET SOMETHING FOR THE FOR THE ASSET. WE HAD AN APPRAISAL DONE APPROXIMATELY SIX YEARS AGO. AND THE APPRAISED VALUE WAS AROUND A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THAT WAS BEFORE IT WAS IDENTIFIED CHROME SIX. SO AT THIS POINT. WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND A CONTAMINATED WATER SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST AND. RAISING RATES OR TREATING THOSE WATERS IS NOT FEASIBLE SPECIALLY WHEN WE'VE ALREADY PLACED. THAT GRAMPUS ON CLOSE TO SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF TREATMENT FACILITIES IN WILLOW'S WHEN WE CAN TIE INTO THAT SYSTEM AND AND TREAT AND. PROVIDE THE WATER DOWN TO THAT SYSTEM THAT'S TREATED IN AND. SAFE FOR CUSTOMERS. AND I GUESS I YOU KNOW FOR MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND THAT WHEN I WAS A AND THE COUNCIL MEMBER THE CITY FEELS PER WEEK. WE WERE ARE ARE ONE OF THE FEW CITIES IN CALIFORNIA I THINK OR ARE THERE THERE PROBABLY QUITE A FEW CITIES BUT. A SMALL CITY TWELVE THOUSAND PEOPLE OWN OUR OWN WATER UTILITY OUR OWN ELECTRIC UTILITY R. WASTEWATER UTILITY OF VERY UNUSUAL FOR A SMALL CITY AND I'M WE OFTEN HAD REQUESTS YOU WANT YOU DIVEST YOURSELF OF YOUR OF THE ELECTRIC UTILITY. ABOUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN YOU DO THOSE CALCULATIONS THE VALUE OF THAT. TO THE PUBLIC WAS REALLY PRETTY MINIMAL AND REALLY NOT WORTH THE EFFORT CPAS AYE THE FACT THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE A LOWER RATE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. SO. WITH WITH A WITH CHALLENGES THERE SO IT'S A PRETTY AYE I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I'M I I DO ECHO SOME OF FUNDS TO GLORIA'S CONCERN SIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THE MEMBER YES JUST AN ADDITIONAL COMMENT. AYE I SEE THIS A PROBLEM A HUGE PROBLEM DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THERE AND MAKE MY CITY IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE FIVE DIFFERENT WATER AGENCIES SERVING. YOU KNOW ONE ONE CITY AND THERE'S ONE IN PARTICULAR THAT REALLY SHOULD JUST. I KALITTA DAY AND. YOU KNOW THEY JUST HAVE SO MANY ISSUES BUT. THIS WOULD HELP. IN THE CONSULATE THE CONSOLIDATION OF THAT ONE SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS FORWARD BUT YOU'RE GONNA GET A LOT OF CHALLENGES. I BELIEVE AYE IF WE EXPAND ON ANY OF THESE. PARAMETERS BECAUSE THERE'S YOU KNOW BUT THE WORD HAS BEEN FOR YEARS AND YEARS THAT ALL THESE WATER AGENCIES SHOULD CONSOLIDATE SO I JUST WANT TO CAUTION YOU. THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PUSHBACK FROM YOU KNOW BIGGER AGENCIES THAT ARE. THERE AND DON'T WANT TO GO AWAY AND I THINK THE PUSH. HASBEEN AT SOME POINT FROM EVEN THOUGH PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO CONSOLIDATE ALL THESE WATER AGENCIES SIDE ONE OPEN THE DOOR. UNIFORM FOR CHALLENGES LIKE THAT'S I JUST WANNA MAKE FACTOR YOU KNOW JUST THE CAUTION BECAUSE THIS OPEN BACK DOOR SOMETHING. THANK YOU THANK YOU WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION VICE CHAIR. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. BUT KNOW FIRST WELL APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR ME OF BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I THINK THERE IS DEFINITELY. THAT THIS COULD BE A TOOL BUT TO HELP LOCAL COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY SMALL AND IN MY UNDERSTAND IS. THAT THIS IS REALLY TARGETED TOWARD SMALL. PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS. AND MANY OF. MAY HAD THIS EXPERIENCE IN MY RURAL DISTRICT WHERE WE HAVE. NEO PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS THAT REALLY DISK CAN'T COVER THE COST. TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THEM. AND IN SOME CASES IT'S MADE SENSE TO YOU KNOW DIE BEST. FROM THEM. AND OBVIOUSLY THE CITY OF WILLOW'S IS IN MY DISTRICT. AND I THINK A MR PEABODY FOR COMING DOWN TODAY. AND IN TALKING ABOUT THIS THIS ISSUE. I THINK THAT THIS LEGISLATION COULD BE HELPFUL FOR COMMITTEES LIKE WILLOW'S WHERE. YOU KNOW REALLY MAKE SENSE TO DO THIS. THERE'S A LOT OF PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR. A WHAT I WHAT I THINK ABOUT IS. YOU KNOW MAYBE SOME SITUATIONS WHERE. YOU NEED TO HAVE PROTECTIONS. IN PLACE. AND WHERE AND WHERE THE PUBLIC MAY NOT BE SO. INCLINED TO SUPPORT DIVESTITURE. ONE THING I'D LIKE TO SEE AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SOMETHING YOU CONSIDERED I KNOW WE'VE. I THINK THE COMMITTEE MEMBER IT'S MAKING A TEN DAY PROCESS FOR THE PROTEST. I THINK WE WOULD NEED MORE TIME THAT I THINK UNDER PROP. TO EIGHTEEN IT'S A FORTY FIVE DAY. PROCESS YOU KNOW FOR THE PUBLIC TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROTEST IF THEY NEED TO. AND I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT MIGHT BE WORTH PUTTING IN HERE IS NOT JUST THE. THE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT THAT WOULD TAKE IT TO AN ELECTION. BUT PERHAPS THE JUST LIKE TWO EIGHTEEN IF IF FIFTY PERCENT PLUS ONE. THAT COME IN AND THAT FORTY FIVE DAY PERIOD IMP AND PROTEST THE SALE. THAT THE CELL WOULD NOT GO FORWARD. NON THE I THINK THAT BE MORE CONSISTENT WITH THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE FOR. YOUR CONSUMERS AND AND TAXPAYERS. TO ENSURE THAT SOMETHING'S NOT GOING FOR THIS GOING TO. YOU KNOW NEGATIVELY AFFECT THEIR RATES POTENTIALLY IN THE FUTURE THAT THINGS LIKE THAT BUT BUT STILL HAVE THE TOOL IN PLACE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO DO A COSTLY ELECTION YOU KNOW I GUESS IS IS. HERE WHEN HEARING WHICH. BUT HAVE THOSE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE AND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'VE CONSIDERED AS ABSOLUTELY MAY WE COULD. INCORPORATED THE BILL GOING FORWARD. MISTER MEMBER ABSOLUTELY. WE'VE CERTAINLY LOOKED AT THE FORTY FIVE DAYS AND SO IT WILL TAKE THAT. AND AND AMEND THE BILL. TO REFLECT THAT. CERTAIN WE'VE BEEN AND APPRECIATE EACH MEMBER OF YOUR ARTICULATION OF THE POINTS THAT YOU LIKE TO SEE AND WE WANT TO MAKE THIS BILL BETTER AND WE WILL MAKE THIS BILL BETTER. SO THAT YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE AFTER THIS COMMITTEE. VOTING ON THE FLOOR.

RIGHT ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK. OPPOSITION OF THE. I CAN'T MAKE BOB HAVE A CALIFORNIA'S FOR TOBACCO HARM REDUCTION IN OPPOSITION. YOU KNOW. THE QUESTIONS COMMITTEE. CLEAN UP YOUR. JIM CLARIFICATION BECAUSE THIS IS A INTRODUCTION OR RE INTRODUCTION OF THE BILL AND I WANT TO SEE WHAT THE DIFFERENCES FROM THE PREVIOUS ONE NOT MAYBE. THIS STILL APPLIES TO ALL STATE PARKS INCLUDING STATE BEACHES. YES OF THE THE DIFFERENCE. IS NOT IN THIS BILL BUT IN THE PRIOR VETO THAT THE GOVERNOR HAD WHERE HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT HOW BROAD THE BILL WAS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE THE PARKS DIRECTOR MORE DISCRETIONON HOW TO. APPLY OR NOT APPLY IT ON. THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE I PERSONALLY DON'T YOU KNOW. AGREE TOO MUCH WITH THAT TYPE OF LEEWAY BUT THAT. PERHAPS FOR GOVERNMENT ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES THERE MAY BE A RATIONALE TO HAVE SOME TYPE OF DISCRETION AND SO THAT IS IN THE LEGISLATION. GOTCHA SO IT COULD APPLY TO EITHER BUT IT'S DISCRETIONARY. AYE THAT'S RIGHT BEYOND DAWN IN IN TERMS OF. OF WHAT IT'S INTENDED TO COVER. IS IT DOES CIGARETTES ONLY IS IT CIGARS IS IT VAPING HOW WHAT WHAT IS IT YOU DOES. IT IS SUCH A BROAD UNIVERSE THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE SAY WHAT IS A SUPPLY TO MARIJUANA AND I THINK THAT I WOULD SAY THAT'S TOO NARROW BECAUSE WE. INCLUDE WE'D OR OTHER PLANT. AND VAPING AS PART OF THAT OKAY. AND SO IT DOES POTENTIALLY INCLUDE CIGARS ELECT RIGHT. THANK YOU FOR CLARIFICATION APPROACH AGAIN WHICH MIGHT BE SO I PERSONALLY. DON'T. FEEL LIKE I WANT BUT I KNOW THAT FROM A POLICY LEVEL IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE FOR CALIFORNIA. YAK IS ON THE LAST IMAGE YOU'RE INTRODUCED UNITED THAT TRY TO DRILL DOWN ON SOME OF THE QUESTIONS BECAUSE. I SOMETIMES IMPOTENCE FOR LEGISLATION LIKE THIS IS THE LETTER QUESTION. I WHICH CIGARS DON'T NECESSARILY APPLY TO BECAUSE THERE'S NOT A FILTER SITUACIóN. WITH THE CIGARS BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY MUCH A BIODEGRADABLE. AYE AND THEN THERE'S THE SECOND HAND SMOKE QUESTIONS SOME PEOPLE HAVE BOTH OF THOSE SOME PEOPLE HAVE ONE OR THE OTHER. AYE AND SO WHAT THAT WAS A PART OF WHAT I. THANK YOU THANK YOU I APPRECIATE IT ANOTHER QUESTION OVER HERE DR. OKAY YEAH A NOT SPECIFICALLY UP AT ANY QUESTION BUT I THOUGHT I AM A STRONG PROPONENT OF A. SMOKING BAN ASSAULT WHEN ON. PUBLIC AREA. INDIA CITY OF IRVINE. MY. IN TERMS THAT I HIRED. ABOUT THE SEVEN EIGHT YEARS AGO AND THAT HE DID A. VERY IN DEPTH A STUDY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS SO AND THAT FOUND OUT THAT THE SECONDARY SMOKING. YOU MAY SMOKER AND HER JAW BODY SO FAMILY UP TO YOU BUT THE SECONDARY SMOKING THE PERSON NEXT TO YOU INHALING. THAT IS ARE SOMETIMES MORE DETRIMENTAL AND THAT THEREFORE WE ADOPTED. NOW KNOW SOME ARE SMOKING ON A PUBLIC PARKS IN THE. IT WAS SO UNANIMOUSLY COM PASSED. A IN THE CITY OF IRVINE AND THEN I THINK THAT IS SO ALSO. A SEEM NOT PRINCIPLE SHOULD APPLY. EVERYWHERE ELSE IN IN DISCUS PARTICULARLY IN INTO PEACHES SO AND ALSO IN THE PARKS AND THAT WHERE. WE HAVE SEEN. MANY MANY TIMES OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF. A DEVASTATING FIRE THAT CAUSING A PROPERTY DAMAGES SO IN THEIR LIVES. SO I THINK THAT THIS IS. A GOOD BEYOND THE ONLY THING THAT I'M. QUESTIONING IS SO IF OUR. GOVERNOR VETOED. A WIDOW WITH THE. LAST YEAR WHEN I WAS HIS. AND UP ALL ON THE NEW GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AWHILE OLD GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF THAT BAND SO YEAH I GUESS. SO HOW WE CAN. PROMOTE THOUGH WHICHEVER THE GOVERNOR IT MAY BE. SO THAT THEY HE WOULD BE CONVINCED US SOME KIND OF A A EDUCATING THIS IS SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT PRINCE POOR. AYE HE VETO DON. JUAN BUT THIS IS A PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE AND THE HEALTH ISSUE IN A PROPERTY ISSUE. I THINK THAT YOU JUST VOICED IN FIRST FALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR CHOI FOR RAISING THE CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE. I THINK YOU JUST RAISED. THE ENCOURAGEMENT THAT GOVERNOR BROWN NEEDS TO DO THE RIGHT THING BEFORE HE LEAVES OFFICE. GOV AND I OWN TO THAT RISING OPPORTUNITY FOR HIM TO HAVE THAT BE PART OF HIS LEGACY. THANK YOU. YOU WALK. BEST WISHES. BARNICLE MOTION THE BILL. I JUST WANNA ADAM I TOLD THE STORY LAST TIME ABOUT MY DAUGHTER. GOING OFF IN THE BEACH WITH HER PALE AND COMING BACK WITH A PAIL FULL OF CIGARETTE BUTTS. AND I THINK A LOT OF US HAVE HAD THE EXPERIENCE OF HAVING TO PICK YOU KIDS UP. CRYING DRAG AWAY FROM THEIR SANDCASTLE AND WHERE THEY'VE BEEN VERY HAPPY BECAUSE SOMEONE SITS DOWN AND DECIDES TO SMOKE A CIGAR. RIGHT NEXT YEAR ON THE BEACH AND LET'S BE HONEST. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE RANDOMLY PATROLLING EMPTY BEACHES LOOKING FOR REPORTER SMOKING THIS IS GOING TO COME OUT THE WAY COMES UP IN A LOT OF OUR CITIES WE'RE GONNA BE COMPLAINT DRIVEN. WHEN SOMEONE'S CREATING A NUISANCE WHEN THEY'RE IN A CROWDED BEACH AND THERE. I'M SMOKING A CIGAR IN HAND SUBJECTING CHILDREN AND. OTHER BEACH GOERS TO SECOND HAND SMOKE OR SOMEONE'S LITTERING THIS IS A TOOL THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN USE. TO TO CRACKDOWN ON THOSE PEOPLE SO I THINK ANYONE IS WORRIED ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU CAN HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT PATROLLING MILES OF. BEACH LOOKING FOR PEOPLE ARE SMOKING YOU KNOW THAT'S PRETTY SERIOUS SILLY WE WE DON'T SEE THAT WITH IN OUR CITIES WE HAVE SMOKING ORDINANCES THAT THAT DEAL WITH PARKS WHEN OCULUS YOU HERE. BUT IT'S GOING TO BE A REALLY GOOD TOOL FOR PER. LAW ENFORCEMENT BE ABLE TO CRACK DOWN PEOPLE BETTER THAT ARE CREATING A NUISANCE AND YOU KNOW MAKE A MUCH BETTER ENVIRONMENT FOR ALL OF US AT THE BEACHES I FELT VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS BILL LAST TIME I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN IT WAS VETOED AND I HOPE THAT YOU. HAVE BETTER LUCK WITH THAT THIS TIME. IT WOULD. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL BACK I I REALLY ADMIRE YOUR PERSISTENCE ON THIS ISSUE. HEAD AS A AS A LONGTIME ADVOCATE FOR HEALTH AND AND. AND SMOKING CESSATION I REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE THAT IN OUR CITY YOU KNOW WE. WE HAD. WE BANNED SMOKING IN PARKS AND AND THINGS VERY EARLY ON IN. AND WE HAD SIMILAR EXPERIENCES GOING AROUND OUR LITTLE IN OUR IN THE CITY FEELS OR HAS A ONE ACRE PARKINSON PLAZA AND WE. I'M I'VE I REMEMBER GOING AROUND WITH ONE OF MY. OF A PHYSICIAN FRIEND OF MINE. COLLECTING CIGARETTE BUTTS FROM THE PARK AND HOW HOW DISTASTEFUL THAT THAT ACTUALLY WAS AND SO. SO WE ALSO WHEN WE IMPLEMENTED THESE BANDS THIS WAS NOT THIS WAS NOT A GOTCHA THERE WAS NO DEDICATED OFFICER TO RUN AROUND IN AND WRITE TICKETS FOR PEOPLE. USUALLY WHAT IT WHAT IT ACCOUNTED FOR WHAT WHAT IT MEANT WAS THAT SOMEONE WOULD SAY YOU KNOW WE I DO HAVE A BAN ON SMOKING IN THE PARTY HAS NOT TO DO THAT AND AND. I DON'T RECALL ANYBODY PUSHING BACK AGAINST SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY DID THAT SO SO IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S I THINK IS COMMON DECENCY IT'S A FUNDAMENTALLY BETTER FOR EVERYONE'S HEALTH AND I REALLY APPRECIATE BRING INFORMED THANK YOU.
