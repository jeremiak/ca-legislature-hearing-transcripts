MOTION PASSES MOTION PASSES FOR A MISTER COOLEY PLEASE BEGIN ON AB TWENTY FIVE NINETEEN. SECOND HAS STATED THIS IS A VEHICLE OF STATE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD WAS CREATED BY THE LEGISLATURE NINETEEN FORTY SIX TO OVERSEE FISCAL MATTERS OF SOCIAL WITH THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT FOR STATE AGENCIES. AND TO SELECT THE REQUIRED REAL PROPERTY FOR STATE FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS IT IS ALSO ALSO THE ISSUER OF LEASE REVENUE BONDS WHICH ARE A FORM OF LONG TERM FINANCING USED TO PAY FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS. AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX BACK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF SIGNED BY GOVERNOR BROWN AUTHORIZES STATE PUBLIC WORKS BOARD ISSUE LEASE REVENUE BONDS OR NOTES PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE ACQUISITION DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A STATE CAPITOL BUILDING ANNEX IN ANY ANCILLARY IMPROVEMENTS TO AFFECT WITH KAPLAN'S PROJECT. THIS BILL MAKES CLEAR THAT THE EXTENT RELIED UPON THE BOND AUTHORITY EXTENDS WALL COST STRUCTURE WITH RELATED OR NESTOR WERE FOR THE PROJECT AUTHORIZED BY GOVERNMENT COULD ANYONE TWELVE INDIGENOUS LANGUAGES PROVIDE BIOLOGIC COUNCILS A VEHICLE. ON HAND OF I WILL SIMPLY NOTE THAT AS INTEREST RATES RISE THERE IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER THAT A USEFUL LEASE REVENUE BONDS IN THE PROJECT IS A GOOD COURSE OF ACTION FOR TAXPAYERS BUT I REQUEST AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU TO HAVE WITH AND WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RACHEL GATES ORANGE COUNTY- HONESTLY. I ACTUALLY DON'T EVEN HAVE WORDS- I AM THOUGHT THAT THANK YOU. OKAY THE RIGHT. ALL THIS SOMEONE TRYING. I GET TWO MINUTES IS THAT RIGHT YES. WHAT'S FUNNY BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING I WANNA READ. FROM ONE OF THE- ACTIVIST FRIENDS OF MINE WHO WAS ARRESTED. BECAUSE HE WAS STANDING UP FOR THE RIGHT TO NOT HAVE THE GOVERNMENT FORCED MEDICAL INJECTIONS INTO HIS VEINS OR HIS CHILDREN'S BRAINS AND YET I CAN'T FIND IT BECAUSE I'M A GOAT FARMER AND IT'S NOT LIKE I LIKE ANY OF THIS TECHNOLOGY. AND SO AS I SCROLL FOR THIS THROUGH THIS THING I COULD JUST TALK OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I COULD ALSO BE QUIET I COULD JUST BE SILENT BECAUSE WOULDN'T THAT BE A WAY TO LIKE USE THE TIME. BECAUSE OF ALL THE NOISE IN OUR CULTURE AND YOU KNOW YOU LEGISLATORS. MAYBE WHAT YOU NEED MAYBE WHAT I NEED MAYBE WE ALL NEED TO JUST SIT AND QUIET I DON'T KNOW MAYBE YOU DON'T NEED ME TO READ SOMETHING FROM THOMAS JEFFERSON MAYBE YOU DON'T NEED ME TO READ SOMETHING FROM- ONE OF OUR FOREFATHERS BECAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE ANY OF YOU SEEM TO BE PAYING ATTENTION TO ANY OF THAT. ANYWAY BECAUSE IF YOU WERE YOU WOULDN'T BE BUILDING A GLASS PALACE TO YOUR OWN POWER BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY HOW I SEE THIS. AND THE TRUTH IS IF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA KNEW THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU WERE DOING I'M CONVINCED THEY WOULD SEE IT THAT WAY TOO. PEOPLE DON'T KNOW YOU'RE DOING THIS THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THE BASICS OF GOVERNMENT YOU'VE TAKEN CIVIC SIDE OF THE SCHOOL THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY HAVE RIGHTS. THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT THEY DON'T KNOW YOU'RE IN HERE SPENDING OUR MONEY. AND IT'S BEEN BY DESIGN AND WE KNOW THIS AND THE PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF IT. LIKE I SAID A MOMENT AGO THEY CAN'T EVEN FILL THEIR GAS TANKS.
