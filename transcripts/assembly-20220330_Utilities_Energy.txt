IN THE MORNING FROM. RIGHT WE'RE NOW GOING TO OUR CALL TO ORDER ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE INFORMATIONAL ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON UTILITIES AND ENERGY INFORMATIONAL HEARING WE'RE HERE TO DISCUSS THE INCREASING ENERGY RATES EXPERIENCED THROUGHOUT THIS WINTER AND SOLUTIONS WE MIGHT IMPLEMENT TO PREVENT THEIR CONTINUED. TO START WE HAVE SOME HOUSEKEEPING TO GO OVER MEAN COURAGE EVERYONE TO PRACTICE PHYSICAL DISTANCE SENIOR WEARING MASKS AT ALL TIMES HERE IN THE ROOM AND THROUGHOUT THE CAPITOL BUILDING. WE HAVE VERY LIMITED SPACE SO SOME OF OUR PANELISTS WILL BE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY ENCOURAGED THOSE WHO ARE WATCHING TO CALL IN DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENT SECTION OF THIS HEARING.

TO MAKE TIME FOR EVERY PERSON WITHOUT WANTING TO COMMENT WE WILL LIMIT REMOTE PUBLIC TESTIMONY TWO ONE MINUTE PER PERSON. ALL RIGHT QUESTIONS REGIS OPENING STATEMENT JUST GO DOWN HERE TO. SECTIONS OKAY. I CAN VEGAS OF. YEAH I'M GOING TO READ THE CHAIR'S OPENING STATEMENT HE'S BEEN INADVERTENTLY- KEPT. ARE KEPT AWAY FROM THE HEARING OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS MANY CALIFORNIANS HAVE EXPERIENCED RECORD HIGH ELECTRIC AND GAS BILLS SOME CUSTOMERS REPORTED A DOUBLING OR TRIPLING OF THEIR BILL EVEN WHEN THEIR USAGE DID NOT CHANGE MOST OF THESE BILLS INCREASES CAME UNEXPECTEDLY SHOCKING MANY CALIFORNIANS ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH INFLATION AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY FOR AN EXTENDED GLOBAL PANDEMIC. THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING IS TO EXAMINE WHAT IS DRIVING THIS CONTINUED INCREASE IN RATES. THE HIGHLIGHT CURRENT THINKING ABOUT SOLUTIONS TO HELP MANAGE THESE COSTS. WE HAVE INVITED A PANEL TO DISCUSS POTENTIAL IMPACTS AND SOLUTIONS TO MANAGE FUTURE HIGH ELECTRIC RATES. WE WILL START WITH SIMON BAKER DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA UTILITIES COMMISSION. I ASK OUR PANELISTS PROVIDE THEIR OPENING STATEMENTS BEGIN THEN TURNED TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS DIRECTOR BAKER. HE WILL BE ON THE SCREEN SO. DIRECTOR BAKER. GOOD AFTERNOON THAT THAT THAT THAT FOUND CHECK CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES AND CAN YOU SEE ME ON THE SCREEN. NO ARE THERE WE GO. WE NOW SEE OKAY. HELLO SO I'M GOING TO ATTEMPT TO SHARE MY FIVE HELP WORK. YEAH REMEMBER WE'RE BEGINNING YEAH WE CAN SEE YOUR LAPTOP WE CAN SEE THE POWER POINT. VERY GOOD I DOING HERE I'M ARE YOU ABLE TO LOOK AT MY TO MY POWER POINT YEAH IT INDICATES WE AT- IT LOOKS GOOD. AT JUST ONE MOMENT PLEASE. WELL WE DID SAID NOW WE ONLY SIERRA. OKAY OUR ARMED GO AGAIN HERE. OKAY. ALL RIGHT. GOOD AFTERNOON ASSEMBLY MEN CORK AND HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. TODAY I'M GOING TO BE- SHARING WITH YOU WHAT WE'RE SAYING IN TERMS OF HISTORICAL TRENDS IN THE LARGE ALECTRA INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY OUT WE ALSO REGULATE A SMALLER MARKETERS FICTIONAL UTILITIES BUT TODAY'S PRESENTATION OF FOCUS ON A LARGE I'VE USED. ALSO WHAT WE'RE pTERM COST DRIVERS IN AND RATES. AND AN OVERALL TRENDS AND- AND CAUGHT. IN RECENT YEARS AND LOOKING FORWARD. SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING TO MITIGATE THOSE RATE AND BILL IMPACT. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IN OUR AFFORDABILITY PROCEEDING. TO REVIEW ADDITIONAL BLUE SKY PROPOSALS INCLUDING SOME- ACTIONS THAT WOULD REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE ACTION. TO FURTHER MITIGATE RATE AND BILL IMPACT. SO- FIFTH TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN WE'VE BEGUN TO SEE A TREND THAT CAN OPERATE BEGINNING TO INCREASE AT A RATE THAT EXCEEDS THE RATE OF INFLATION. AND A BIT SLIDESHOWS- RESIDENTIAL RATE FOR THE THREE LARGE UTILITY. AND WE CAN SEE THAT THE- SOLID COLORED SHADED AREA HERE WHICH IS SHOWING THE HISTORICAL DATA FROM TWENTY THIRTEEN- TO TWENTY TWENTY AND THERE YOU CAN SEE THAT FOR PG&amp;E AND FOR US TO DOANY. REALLY THE- INCREASE IN AND RESIDENTIAL RATE HAS HAS GONE ABOVE THE BLACK LINE WHICH IS THE RATE OF- SPPI INDEX OF INFLATION. ADDISON'S RATE- HAVE STAYED UNDER THAT BLACK LINE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND- BROKE THE TREND AND CUT JOINED TOGETHER UNTIL EIGHT. AND THEN WHAT WE DID- THE STATE ACTUALLY THEY COME FROM- A- SPECIAL STUDY THAT WE DID AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND THE COMMISSION HELD IN ON BOND. WITH SISTER AGENCIES TO BRING ATTENTION TO THAT ISSUE WHICH WE'VE BEEN REPORTING ON AND ARE AB FIFTY SEVEN RECORD INTERESTED SIX NINETY FIVE RECORD- SINCE WE FIRST STARTED TAKING A TREND IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. AND THEN THAT SPECIAL STUDY WE DID A TEN YEAR A GREAT PROJECTION WHICH NECESSARILY REQUIRED A LOT OF MONEY I FUNCTIONS AND WITH UNCERTAINTY. BUT WHAT YOU SEE HERE IN THE HASH MARKS AND IT'S CRAP THAT THE RESULT. OF THAT OF THOSE VERY PROJECTIONS. AND SO WHAT WHAT WHAT WE- IS THAT BY TWENTY THIRTY. BOND OLD PRESIDENTIAL ELECTRIC RATES ARE FORECASTED TO BE. APPROXIMATELY 40% HIGHER FOR PG&amp;E 20% FOR ADDISON AND 70% PERCENT DIEGO ARE THEN RATES WOULD HAVE BEEN AT TWENTY THIRTEEN RATES HAD JUST GROWN AT THE RATE OF INFLATION. AND WHAT THAT MEANS- FOR OUR MONTHLY BILL INCREASES OVER THE COURSE OF TEN YEARS IF THAT FOR PG&amp;E CUSTOMERS AT THE FORTY FIVE DOLLAR INCREASE ADDISON ABOUT THE FAMED AND FOR SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC ALMOST EIGHTY DOLLARS TO. INCREASE NOW. SINCE THE STUDY WITH DONE LAST YEAR USING TWENTY TWENTY DAY THAT WE HAVE. NEW DATA THAT SUGGESTS THAT SIX PROJECTIONS MAY ACTUALLY BE UNDER- AT THE MEETING FOR EXAMPLE PGNIG RECENTLY MADE A GENERAL RATE CASE FILING IN WHICH THEY'RE PROJECTING AND 19% THE ONLY PRE. SO THE THAT THE MAIN CONTRACTOR THAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE SHORT TERM IS DUE TO INCREASE IN NATURAL GAS PRICES. B- THE THREE LARGE UTILITIES PUT CAUGHT INTO RATE IN TWENTY TWENTY. THAT AMOUNTED TO ABOUT A 19% RATE INCREASE FOR PG&amp;E. IN A 100% RATE INCREASE FOR AT A TEN AND 11% FOR SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC. AND ABOUT HALF OF- THAT THOSE THOSE RATE INCREASES ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE AND- FUEL AND PURCHASED POWER COSTS WHICH ARE NOT BE COVERED THROUGH- WHAT'S CALLED THE ENERGY RESOURCE AND RECOVERY ACCOUNT MARK ERA. AND THAT'S WORKING ON PROJECT PART COSTS ARE RECOVERED. AND NATURAL GAS PRICES HAVE BEEN A FACTOR ON ON POWER PRICES BECAUSE FEDERAL GAS FIRED GENERATION IS- ON THE MARGIN AND AFFECT THE PRICE AND WHOLESALE AND WHOLESALE MARKET. THE CHART ON THE LEFT HERE SHOWS A PRICE TRENDS THAT WE'VE SEEN AT HENRY HUB WHICH IS A MAJOR- TRADING HOW. IT'S BEEN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY THAT THAT THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS HAS GONE OUT WHAT'S DRIVING IT IS THE THIRD INCREASED GLOBAL DEMAND PRIMARILY DUE TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY THANK OF THE NINETEEN AND ALSO. WIDESPREAD DECARBONIZATION POLICIES WHICH ARE DRIVING COAL- OUT OF THE ELECTRIC POWER MIX AND BEING SUBSTITUTED BY NATURAL GAS. WE ALSO SAW AN UNUSUAL WEATHER EVENTS- SO CALLED POLAR VORTEX VERY COLD WEATHER IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. AND IT- CREATED COMBINED WITH THE LIVABILITY CONCERNS BUT OFFERED BY OUR- PRESSURE ON WESTERN DELIVERY POINTS. AND THEN FOR SOCAL IMPENDING A CRITICAL GAS AND ELECTRIC BUT PARTICULAR SITUATION THERE IN THE SOUTHERN SYSTEM WHERE AN OUTAGE ON THE EL PASO INTERSTATE PIPELINE IN- INTO MEXICO. AFFECT THEIR AN IMPORTANT REMINDER IS THAT THE PRICE OF FOSSIL NATURAL GAS THAT IS NOT REGULATED TO DETERMINED BY THE MARKET. AND THE PC DOES REVIEW UPDATES GOING PURCHASED POWER COSTS IN THE ERA PROCEEDING WHERE THOSE COSTS ARE COLLECTED. AND THEN WE ALSO REVIEW OTHER COSTS THAT ARE WHAT'S CALLED DEREK THE GENERAL RATE CASE PROCEEDING THAT'S WHERE. THE UTILITY MAKE THE PROPOSAL ON WHAT THEY BELIEVE TO BE THE COPS TO SERVE ELECTRICITE AND REPAIR ADVOCATES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THAN PICK THAT IN- EVIDENTIARY PROCEEDINGS AND- ULTIMATELY APPROVED. A BUDGET FOR THE UTILITY TO OPERATE THEIR SYSTEMS BASICALLY. AND BY THE WAY. SO WHAT DO WE THINK IN TERMS OF THE COST DRIVERS. WATER MITIGATION IS- ONE THE- IF. RIGHT NOW AND MOST OF THAT IS BEING- COLLECTED THROUGH THE DISTRIBUTION CONTENT THE COMPONENTS OF OUR GREAT. WHAT YOU SEE ON THE RIGHT THERE IS- A GRAPH LOOKING AT TRENDLINES FROM TWENTY ELEVEN TO TWENTY TWENTY. FOUR THE COMBINED I OWE YOU. BROKEN DOWN BY TYPE OF- DISTRIBUTION INVESTMENT AND YOU CAN SEE A BIG UPTICK IN TWENTY TWENTY AND OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE. WHAT'S THAT FROM THE VEGETATION MANAGEMENT CLEAR LINES ALSO- LIABILITY INSURANCE POTS. AND THEN ALSO IN TWENTY FIFTEEN YOU CAN EITHER SEND AN UPTICK IN THE RETURN ON RATE BASE AND DEPRECIATION TOLD HER THAT YOU COULD HAVE ELEMENT OF CAPITAL COSTS- BETTER THERE AS WELL. TO PUT IT IN SPECIFIC NUMBERS ADDICT AND- PUT A THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE VENTURE RIGHT ON JANUARY FIRST AND PG&amp;E. HAS BEEN A MARKETING CREATE AN INSURANCE EXPENSES UP FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IT OUT FROM JULY. TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO DECEMBER TWENTY NINETEEN. WELL THE THING THAT ALEXA TREND ABOUT FOR. PICNIC TO INCREASE TAKEN TRAINING SENT TO ELEVEN. AND YOU CAN PLAY ON ON THE RIGHT HERE THERE'S A CHART WHICH BREAKS IT DOWN BY UTILITY IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF THE ANNUAL GROWTH RATE. HE JENNY HAS GROUND THAT 9% OUT OF AND ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF PERCENT AND FANCY A GO ABOUT 5% I THINK TWENTY ELEVEN AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IN PARTICULAR PG&amp;E HAS TRENDED UP SIGNIFICANTLY. THANK TWENTY. SEVEN AT HAS- HELD STEADY. ALTHOUGH IT DID AFTER RECENTLY AND WE'RE SEEING THAT CONTINUE TO OP CHECK AND SEND IT BECAUSE THAT'LL INCREASING. IF YOU THINK THAT ADVOCATE AT BURKE. TO IN TRANSIT TRANSMISSION OWNER RATE CASES. TO HOLD DOWN THE COST AND WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL. IN THAT EFFORT SO THAT RESULTED IN ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS TO REPAIR SAVINGS FOR PG&amp;E CUSTOMER. TWENTY FOUR DOT TWO HUNDRED MILLION FOR ADDISON AND- EIGHTY SEVEN BILLION PER SAN DIEGO GAS ELECTRIC. ANOTHER MAJOR- DRIVER OF A GRADE INCREASES. GROWTH BEHIND THE METER DISTRIBUTOR JUST ENERGY RESOURCES FOR EXAMPLE- ROOFTOP SOLAR. AND THAT'S BECAUSE- THE SAME AMOUNT OF COSTS NEED TO BE COLLECTED- OVER- OVER OVER OVER THE SALE TO THAT THE UK CAN THOSE. THE JURIST UTILITIES- HAVE FAITH THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES BAND GUARANTEED A- RECOVERY- THERE- OF THE CERTAIN AMOUNT OF REVENUE. AND BECAUSE IT TAKES AWAY THE IF YOU DISINCENTIVE OF THE UTILITY TO- OPPOSE CONSERVATION POLICIES SUCH AS ENERGY EFFICIENCY ARE WITH TOP SELLER. THAT SIDE DE COUPLING POTS OF COFFEE COMPANY POLICY THE BEST PRACTICE- BUT WHAT IT DOES MEAN IS THAT AND- THOSE COSTS AND GET SHIFTED OVER TO OTHER CUSTOMERS THAT ARE CONCERNED CONCERT OUR PART DON'T HAVE. ROOFTOP SOLAR. THE STATE AFTER OP FOR EXAMPLE ESTIMATES THAT THE ANYA COST FROM THE THAT ENERGY METERING CHARACTER ENCOURAGE WITHOUT SELLER- THAT COST. ABOUT THE THREE POINT FOUR BILL DOLLARS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE I'M AT THE POINT OF COMPARISON TO THAT 80% OF THE- TWENTY TWENTY ONE TRANSMISSION COSTS AND IN TOTAL. AND THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE ARE PROJECTS THAT THAT THAT WITHOUT REFORMS TO THE CURRENT NET ENERGY METERING POLICY THAT THAT SHIPPED BACK KAUSHIK COULD INCREASE. TO ALMOST SEVEN BILLION BY TWENTY THIRTY. THE IN THE RIGHT THEIR SHIP. UTILITY REPORTED THE IMPACT OF THE CURRENT ENERGY NEARING POLICY ON NON PARTICIPATING- ARE GREAT PLAYERS. WITH RATE IMPACTS FOR PG&amp;E AT 11% GOING UP TO AS MUCH AS 20% 4% DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC pAND THE EFFECT IT HAS ON ANNUAL BILLS FOR. CARE AND NON CARE CUSTOMERS IT IS SHOWN THERE TO THE RIGHT RANGING FROM- ANYWHERE JOSH HUNDRED DOLLARS TO UPWARDS OF A THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS AGAIN EITHER- YOU KILL ANY REPORTED ACCIDENTS BASED ON DATA THEY SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO A- REQUEST. I TO INFORM OUR SB. SIX NINETY FIVE REPORT. I KNOW MAJOR- POPPED IS TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE- AT ELECTRIFICATION INVESTMENT. THE PT HAS AUTHORIZED A TOTAL OF ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS AND REPAIR FUNDING TO SUPPORT THAT ACTIVITY OF WHICH THREE HUNDRED MILLION AT PARTY SPENT BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT- IT'S PROBABLY IMPOSSIBLE OUR IMPACT ON ON RATES AND- OTHER FACTORS. AND THEN FINALLY- IF YOU SEE HAS. IN RECENT YEARS. WE BEEN ORDER VEHICULAR TO PUT YOUR A GENERATION. AND AND DEMAND SIDE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS TO INCREASE CAPACITY ON THE SYSTEM- TO ENSURE THAT- WE HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO. THE SUMMER ALECTRA PEAK DEMAND I PARTICULARLY AN EXTREME HEAT WAVE DOESN'T RESPOND TO THAT TWENTY TWENTY EXTREME HEAT RATE THAT WE THOUGHT AND ADVANCEMENT THAT WE'VE BEEN MAKING SENSE AND- NOW THERE'S BOUND BY THE HOPE THAT- EVENTUALLY WITH THE INCREASE IN TRANSMISSION ENTRANCE TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION AND BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION THAT SALES WILL INCREASE TO A POINT WHERE. IT BEGINS TO OFFSET SOME OF THESE COSTS THAT WE'RE SEEING. WE CAN THANK AT THE MOMENT THAT WE'RE IN SOMEWHAT PERHAPS THAT'S A VALLEY OF DEATH WHERE WE SEE REALLY HIGH COST BUT BUT LOS FAILED AND- AND WHAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE IN THE WORST OF BOTH WORLDS AND SO. THE HOPE IS THAT ONCE WE GET KIND OF TRUE THAT- AND WE INCREASE FAILED TO ELECTRIFICATION THAT WILL BEGIN TO- SOFTEN. THE BLOW ON RIGHT. WHAT IS YOUR MAIN. BY WHICH WE- MITIGATE AND- IN IT ON RATE AND BILL THAT. THE FIRST IS TO REDUCE COSTS AND VOTE THAT THAT'S BASICALLY THE MOST DIRECT WAY- IMPAIR AND IMPACTING THAT'S- ABOUT THE LARGER- IMPACT ON RATES AND BILLS. RELATIVE TO THE OTHER STRATEGY WHICH IS TO CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE ALLOCATE THOSE COSTS FOR EXAMPLE ALLOCATING. MORE COST. TO CUSTOMERS THAT CAN CONSUME MORE. ELECTRICITY RATHER THAN LAST OR- ALLOCATE COSTS PERHAPS YOU- THOSE WHO CAN- ARE IN HIGHER INCOME BRACKETS OR WHAT HAVE YOU SO. THOSE THOSE THOSE COST ALLOCATION METHODS THAT HAVE A MORE INDIRECT IMPACT AND THEY HAVE A MUCH SMALLER- GREAT IMPACT AND BILL IMPACT AND COST REDUCTION STRATEGY BECAUSE THE SAME AMOUNT OF. COST. NEED TO BE RECOVERED OVERALL. THE WHAT THE PEACE BEEN DOWN- TO TRY ADDRESS THAT WORRISOME. BOB SECURITY- ADORED GRANTED BY THE LEGISLATURE IS ONE WAY OF DRAFTING THAT'S BECAUSE THAT ALLOWS. A VEHICLE IF YOU ARE SPREAD OUT THE COST RECOVERY OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME BUT IT DOES HAVE HIGHER TRANSACTION COSTS THAN TRADITIONAL FINANCING. UNDER AB TEN FIFTY FOUR A FORTY THE PC AUTHORIZED ONE POINT SEVEN THREE BILLION AND SECURITISATION A LOT FOR MITIGATION CAPITAL SPENDING. AND. ANOTHER ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION. IT PENDING OPERATE FOR PJ WHILE OUR CAPITAL. HE ALSO AUTHORIZED SEVEN AND A HALF BILLION A PART OF VIRGINIA'S CORPORATE BANKRUPTCY PLAN. AND UNDER CURRENT STATUTE THE PC HAS ADDITIONAL I HAD ROOM TO- ALLOW SECURITIZATION OF UP TO ANOTHER ONE POINT THREE SEVEN BILLION AND WHILE PARK CAPITAL INVESTMENT. WE ALSO HAVE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO- SECURITIZED OCTOBER NINETEEN HUNDRED COLLECTIONS OR A REAR KIDS OUT BUT WE DID NOT REVIEW A REQUEST BY AT AND TO DO THAT AND IT WAS ACTUALLY DENIED. BY THE COMMISSION GIVEN HIGHER COSTS OVER THE LONG TERM ARCHITECTURE IT TIGHT AND ALSO DUE TO INTERGENERATIONAL. EQUITY CONCERNS. ANOTHER STRATEGY THAT WE HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING IT TO REALLY ENHANCE OUR REVIEW OF WILDFIRE INVESTMENT. SO WE DO THAT YOU'RE BETTER TRACKING OF THE WILDFIRE INVESTMENT. THAT THE UTILITIES ARE PROPOSING AND COORDINATING THROUGH THE OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY OUT REVEALING THE UTILITIES THE WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLAN AND THEN SEEING HOW THOSE PLANS AND TRANSLATE INTO SPECIFIC RATE PROPOSALS AND THE GENERAL RATE CASE PROCESS. AND USING OUR FIFTY MODELS THAT THE PROCEEDING AND RISK MITIGATION PROCEEDINGS- TO- TO RANK HOW- SAFETY- INVESTMENT- SHOULD BE PURSUED AND RANK ORDER BASED ON THEIR WRIST BAND EFFICIENCY. THE WE HAVE METHODS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OUT OF THOSE PROCEEDINGS Q. INFORM BASICALLY WHERE THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK- IS NOT FOR THOSE INVESTMENTS. WE'RE ALSO CONSIDERING A PROPOSAL BY DAY UTILITIES TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN SELF INSURANCE POOLS THIS IS BECAUSE THE UTILITIES ARE SAYING SKY ROCKETING INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND SO THAT COULD BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO HAVE REPAIRS ACTUALLY CREATE THEIR OWN INSURANCE POOLS. I'M SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE REVIEWING. THE PFT- IS ALSO CONSIDERING POSSIBLE SPENDING CAPS OR. ONE WAY BALANCING ACCOUNT. TO ACCOMPLISH THEM OF SPAM- ON THE THAT IN. BUT THAT'S AS WELL BECAUSE WE TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE SPEND SB- OPERATING MAKING AND SAFE MANNER. AND I FINALLY. WE ARE WE CAN EXAMINE RETURN ON THAT THAT IS GRANTED TO THE UTILITY- AT AT AS PART OF THE REGULATORY CONTACT IN A CAPITAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ARE BEFORE US AND- STAKEHOLDERS ARE DEBATING- THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF RATE OF RETURN MADE EFFECTIVE FOR RETURN ON EQUITY- ANOTHER STRATEGY IS TO REVIEW OUR NET ENERGY METERING TERROR POLICY AND AS- I'M SURE YOU ARE ALL AWARE WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF DOING THAT. RIGHT NOW. THERE IS A PROPOSED DECISION ADMINISTRATIVE JOB LAW JUDGE IN THE PRECEDING THAT AT ABOUT THE COMMENT NOW AND THAT CAN HAVE THE EFECT OF REDUCING THE COST SHIFT FROM PARTICIPANTS AND NON PARTICIPANTS. IN OUR INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING PROCESS. WE ALSO- TAKE A VERY THOUGHTFUL AND COMPREHENSIVE ANALYTICAL APPROACH TO LOOK AT ALL THE DIFFERENT. RESOURCE OPTIONS YOU NEED OUR GREENHOUSE GAS. AND RELIABILITY AND CLEAN ENERGY GOALS AND TO DO TELESCOPIC ACTIVELY THROUGH A- TECHNOLOGY AGNOSTIC- APPROACH. AND THEN FINALLY WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT BILL PAYMENT RELIEF OPTIONS SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED IN THE LAST. COUPLE YEARS AND- THE I GET CONNECTIONS PROCEEDING IN ANOTHER PROCEEDING TO IMPLEMENT FOR EXAMPLE- PAYMENT PLANS TWELVE TO TWENTY FOUR MONTH PAYMENT PLANS FOR RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS ALSO IN ARREARS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES PARTIAL ARREARS FORGIVENESS. AS PART ABOUT PAYMENT PLAN AND ALSO- WE ARE WE HAVE A FOUR YEAR PAYMENT PLAN PILOT ACROSS UTILITY TO ARMAND. TO TO ESTABLISH THE AMOUNT THAT A CUSTOMER WOULD PAY BASED ON- BASED ON INCOME. THE FINALLY WE OPENED A PROCEEDING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO LOOK AT THE PORTABILITY ISSUE BECAUSE OF THE WORK AND TRANSIT WE'VE BEEN PAYING. AND BUT FAR WE HAVE. DEVELOPED AND ADOPTED A SET OF AFFORDABILITY METRICS AND ALSO AT THAT OF FORECASTING TOOLS. AND IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AS PART OF THAT PROCEEDING WE- WE HELD IN OUR BALK AT THE NATION'S EARLIER. AND AND TRANSMITTED THE RESULT OF THAT IN OUR LIVES REPORT FOR SB SIX NINETY FIVE AND THEN IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR WE AGAIN HAD ANOTHER ON BOND HEARING WITH ALL OF OUR COMMISSIONERS AND SISTER AGENCIES. WHICH REALLY STARTED TO BRING IT OPTIONS IN THE CLEAR FOCUS AND SO STAKEHOLDERS PRESENTED TO- THE PVC AND NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PROPOSALS. AND THESE ARE BEING UNDER CONSIDERATION RIGHT NOW- AMONG THEM ARE SOME THAT ARE WITHIN. FORTY OF THESE INCLUDE THE PERCENTAGE OF INCOME PAYMENT PLAN THAT I MENTIONED- ALSO IN ENHANCING OUR USE OF THESE. RISK SPENDING EFFICIENCY METRICS. THE ALSO- A PER. TO THE UTILITIES TO THE MAT- GENERAL RATE CASE. PROPOSAL ALTERNATIVE THAT ARE BASED ON THE CPI INDEX TO REDUCE THE ANGER BIAS OF A- UTILITY PRINCIPLE PROPOSAL THAT THEY FILE. ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE TO REDUCE UTILITIES AUTHORIZED RETURN ON EQUITY. OF THE- PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD THAT ARE BEYOND A FEW KEY CURRENT AUTHORITY AT LEAST IN PART OR IN WHOLE. ARE NOT MOVING FROM WILDFIRE MITIGATION INVESTMENT TO THE GENERAL FUND OR PER PUBLIC PURPOSE FUNDS- AND IMPLEMENTING AN INCOME BASIC CHARGE WHERE THE AMOUNT. CHARGE WOULD PROGRESSIVELY INCREASE FOR OUR INCOME HOUSEHOLD THAT'S ONE OF THE COCKTAIL OCCASION I'LL TURN IT IS THAT THERE POSSIBLY PAPER TRANSPORTATION EXPECTATION COSTS IN SOME OTHER WAY. DETERMINE IF- ADDITIONAL- FUTURE DIVISION THAT'S ALREADY MAY BE APPROPRIATE FOR ELECTRIFICATION. INVESTMENT PERHAPS ADOPTING A WILDFIRE MITIGATION SURCHARGE ON Q. CHART. AS AN- HI FIRE THREAT AREA MORE I DO TO TACKLE THE RINKER ON TO THE AND REDUCING THE BECAUSE THE OF WILDFIRES BY APPLYING PIECE SAME SPEND EFFICIENTLY METRICS PRINTER BARBARA TO LAND USE AND COURSE MANAGER YOU FOR THREE MANAGED PRACTICES AND IN STATE LAW PLANNING. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PROPERTY TO PURSUE AND- THAT CONCLUDE LINE REMARKS. THANK YOU DIRECTOR. THANKS. THANK YOU DIRECTOR BAKER- LET ME FIRST ASK- IF WE HAVE QUESTIONS FOR DIRECTOR BAKER- WITH ANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS LIKE TO ASK QUESTIONS. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER BAKER- I BELIEVE THAT I HEAR CORRECTLY- AND INDICATING THAT ABOUT 50% OF. VIA THE INCREASES IN ELECTRICITY PRICES ARE DUE TO THE INCREASES IN NATURAL GAS PRICES. THAT'S CORRECT- OKAY- BUT FOR THE SHORT TERM INCREASE THE THIRD THAT WENT INTO EFFECT- EIGHT THIS YEAR. OKAY. I THINK I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY QUESTION I HAVE AT THIS POINT THANK YOU- NO ONE ELSE I HAVE GO HEAD TO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER KRIEL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST WANTED A POINT OF CLARIFICATION FROM DIRECTOR BAKER AS TO WHEN THE EXPECTED DECISION ON NET ENERGY METERING WOULD BE. AB RIGHT NOW THAT'S IN THE HANDS OF THE- I THANK COMMISSIONER TO THE PROCEEDING THAT THE PRESIDENT REYNOLDS. AND SHE IS. CURRENTLY REVIEWING THE RECORD AFTER STATING. AND AT THE NOTED IN A- PROCEDURAL RULING THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE ISSUED. I BELIEVE THAT WAS IN JANUARY- THAT THE JUDGE NOTED THAT- AN UPDATED PROCEDURAL SCHEDULE WOULD BE ISSUED ONCE THE TIME COULD BE FINE. THE TIME COULD BE FOUND FOR ALL FIVE OF THE COMMISSIONERS TO- TO HOLD A HEARING WHERE BY ALL OF THE PARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING COULD- PRESENT THEIR- THEIR FINAL ARGUMENT TO THE FIVE COMMISSIONERS SO THAT IS STILL PENDING- I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC DATE. DATE FOR YOU AT THAT TIME- BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW. THANK YOU AYE I APPRECIATE THE FRANK RESPONSE CAN YOU JUST CLARIFY FOR THE RECORD AGAIN THE COST SHIFT AND HOW MUCH IT'S COSTING MENTIONED IN YOUR PRESENTATION WHEN THAT ENERGY METERING IS NOT ADDRESSED. ALL RIGHT SO IN MY PRESENTATION I PRIDED- ONE POINT THAT IS ON THE RECORD BY THE IF YOU PUBLIC. ADVOCATE OFFICE. AND I SHOULD CLARIFY THAT THERE ARE OTHER POINTS THAT ARE ON THE RECORD AS WELL AND IT IS THAT A DISPUTED ISSUE OF FACT BUT- BECAUSE- THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE- HAS THAT FUNCTION OF LOOKING AT AT CARE IMPACTS- I GAVE THAT AS ONE EXAMPLE OF AN ESTIMATE AND SO. WHAT THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE AT THE MOMENT IS THAT- THE CURRENT PROJECT IS- THREE POINT THREE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND COULD GROW TO AS MUCH AS SIX POINT SEVEN. BILLION IN TWENTY THIRTY. AT LATIMES CHANGED. THANK YOU SUGGEST TO STATE FOR THE RECORD THE COST SHIFTED NOT ADDRESSING NET ENERGY METERING WHICH HURTS RENTERS AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES WOULD BE AT THE TUNE OF SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IF NOT ADDRESSED BY TWENTY THIRTY. CORRECT BASED ON WHAT YOU JUST SAID. YEAH BUT BUT BUT OKAY THANK YOU. ALL. STRUCTURE. TWENTY THE- SERVICE IS BILL CORK AND- I HAVE A QUESTION HERE FIRST F ALL ON YOUR TRANSMISSION. COSTS DOES THAT INCLUDE THE COST OF FIREPROOFING AS WELL AS A NEW TRANSMISSION. YES THE DOCTOR- WE ARE ARE JUST BEGINNING TO HE- SOME COST FOR- TRANSMISSION. SO CALLED GRID HARDENING PROJECT STARTING TO FACE SOME OF THAT SHOWING UP IN AND TRANSMISSION RATES BUT WE'VE ALSO SEEN- A LOT OF- GET. INVESTMENT IN- AGING INFRASTRUCTURE OVER THE YEARS AND AT THAT THE COMBINATION OF THOSE THINGS IF IT'S WHAT WE'RE SAYING. SO THE- INVESTMENTS FOR EXAMPLE BY SDG ANNIE WENT UP THE FACTOR OF TWO AND A HALF OVER TEN YEARS. WHEN FROM FOUR HUNDRED MILLION TO A BILLION. AND FROM AND A DOUBLE FOR PG&amp;E FROM A BILLION TO TWO BILLION. DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHY THAT CHANGE IN INVESTMENT PER YEAR CHANGE SO MUCH. A PARTY GIVEN FOR ME TO GIVE YOU A MORE SPECIFIC RESPONSE AND BREAKDOWN I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST FOR ME TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU SIR- WITH SOME MORE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. ON THAT. I DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER FOR YOU- AND AT THAT. TIME ALL. I'LL SEND YOU SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. ARE AFTER THE HEARING. THANK YOU THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. NO QUESTION COLLEAGUES HOLD THIS HOLD THANK YOU MR I WANTED TO KIND OF GET A SENSE OF HOW OF THE COSTS OF ELECTRICITY AND CALIFORNIA COMPARES TO OTHER SECTORS OF THIS OF THE COUNTRY AND WE'RE WE MAY BE DEALING WITH WILDFIRE MITIGATION ISSUES YOU HAVE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS AND OTHER CREATING A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF IMPACT. ON RELIABILITY- HOW DO WE- I MEAN IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT NOT WITHSTANDING SOME OF THESE BEING COMPARABLE MAJOR COST DRIVERS- THERE STILL MAY HAVE THEIR RATES A LITTLE BIT LOWER THAN CALIFORNIA. WHAT ARE WE AND IF WE WERE TO COMPARE OURSELVES TO MAYBE ONE OF THE OTHER STATES THAT TERMS OF INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS TRANSMISSION OF COSTS- RELIABILITY MITIGATION MEASURES. DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES EVERYTHING THAT YOU LISTED IN YOUR PRESENTATION IF YOU CAN KIND OF GIVE A SENSE ON HOW WE COMPARE TO OTHERS TO OTHER STATES WITHIN THE- THE OF THE WESTERN STATES AND HOW. WE CAN MAYBE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET OUR COSTS MORE IN LINE WITH WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN OTHER AND OTHER STATES. RIGHT YEAH SO- UNFORTUNATELY I BELIEVE THAT CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A BIT OF A CANARY IN THE COAL MINE WHEN IT COMES TO- EXPERIENCING THAT. THE WORST OF TAX- UP CLIMATE CHANGE AND SO WE REALLY ARE SEEING NOW WILDFIRES AND- YEAH WITH. THE THEY AFFECT THAT THAT'S HAVING- ON ON RATES AND THE NECESSARY RESPONSE TO BE ABLE TO- MITIGATED THE EFFECTS OF WILDFIRE- CALIFORNIA ALSO HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT IN OUR INVESTMENT INCLEAN ENERGY STRATEGY AND FOR THE MOST PART THAT HAS. HAS REALLY BENEFITED- CALIFORNIA RATEPAYERS AND THE ECONOMY OUR STRATEGY OF THE SENATE SAID THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY AND BEEN A- FINAL PENA PLEA AND BATH CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGY. AND ALSO HELP CUSTOMERS TO MANAGE THEIR BILLS BY- REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICITY THAT THAT CUSTOMERS CONSUME I MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT- CALIFORNIA GET COUPLING POLICY. AND THE THOUGHT THAT CAN ACCOMPANIED BY THE- EFFICIENCY STANDARDS IN BUILDINGS AND- AND APPLIANCES ALSO TRUE UTILITY PROGRAMS TO HELP CUSTOMERS. TO INVEST IN- ENERGY EFFICIENT. AND SO WHEN WE BENCHMARK CAL. RATE TO- UTILITIES AROUND THE WE YOU FIND CAL HAS SOME OF THE HIGH RATES BUT BECAUSE WE DO SO MUCH TO ENCOURAGE ENERGY EFFICIENCY WE FIND THAT THE- THAT A LECTOR BILLS- ARE MORE ARE MORE MIDDLE OF THE PACK SO THAT'S BEEN ONE OF OUR STRATEGIES TO BE ABLE TO. REALLY OFFSET THAT BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT WHAT CUSTOMERS ARE SAYING IN TERMS OF THEIR BILLS- I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT IN IN RECENT YEARS- WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO BALANCE THAT OUT COMPLETELY. AND SO NOW WE REALLY ARE STARTING TO SEE SOME OF THAT THAT- THAT STARTING TED TO HIT THE CUSTOMER BILLS WHICH IS WHY WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT- THAT FACE YOU AND- TRYING TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN. TO ADDRESS THAT THAT AS NOTED THROUGH THE AFFORDABILITY PROCEEDING TO REALLY LOOK AT BOULDER SOLUTION- THAT HAVEN'T BEEN CONSIDERED YET AND IN CALIFORNIA AS FAR AS SPECIFICALLY HOW WE BENCHMARK AGAINST OTHER UTILITIES IN THE WEST- I GOT TO TAKE THAT BACK IN AND BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO YOU- DOCUMENTARY- SENATOR ON THAT BECAUSE WE- HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND GET BACK YOU. A REAL QUICK WE ALSO TALK ABOUT A COUPLE YEARS. WHEN WE WERE. HAVING HEARING ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS WAS LOOKING AT RATE REFORM. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THE CPUC HAS. ARE LOOKED AT AS A- AN AREA THAT'S WORTHY OF. EXPLORATION YES THAT IS A FAMILY MANDATORY ENTERED OTHER- IT IS ONE OF THE STRATEGIES THAT- THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT SO AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR EXAMPLE- IN AB THREE TWENTY FIVE AND- IN SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON RATE DESIGN AND- AS A RESULT OF THAT WE OPENED THAT RESIDENTIAL RATE WITH ONE PROCEEDING WHICH RESULTED IN. A TRANSITION TOP OF THE- THE SHARPEST INCLINING BLOCK RATE HERE NOW- TIME OF USE RATES AND WE'RE FINDING THAT- THAT IS- WE'RE HAVING SOME SUCCESS WITH THAT. ONE OF THE OTHER- RATE REFORM STRATEGY THAT- WAS MENTIONED AS ONE OF THE STRATEGIES AND- STAKEHOLDERS TO PUT FORWARD AND- AFFORDABILITY ON BONTA IS TO IS TO LOOK OUT. HOW HOW SOME OF THE- X. CLASS- THAT YOU'RE- AND CHARGE AB PRESENTLY RESIDENTIAL FIXED ARE CAPPED AT. 10% PER STATUTE- AND SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT YOU KNOW LEGISLATION TO RE LOOK AT THAT. MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO- CHANGE THE WAY THAT- COSTS ARE ARE RECOVERED AND THAT ACCOMPANIED WITH- YEAH LOOKING AT WAYS THAT- THAT COULD BE DONE WITHOUT WE'RE PROGRESSIVELY- HAVING AN EFFECT ON ON THE LOWER INCOME CUSTOMERS. MIGHT BE A WAY OF GOING ABOUT THAT BUT THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES TO LOOK AT WITH REGARD TO THAT AND ADVOCATING- IT WILL BE LOOKING AT THAT AND- AND AT THAT THING EXTENT TO WHICH WE NEED ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ACTION ON THAT FRONT. BUT YOU THANK YOU OF SOME MEMBERS WHICH- THANK YOU- MISTER BAKER I AM AND LOOKING AT TO. A INFORMATIONAL- HEARING- A WRITTEN BRIEFING- THAT- HAS BEEN DISTRICT DISTRIBUTED TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M NOT SURE IF YOU HAVE A COPY OF THIS BUT- WHAT WHAT ONE THING THAT TO. WAS NOT AWARE OF I PROBABLY SHOULD BE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF BUT- THAT THE STATEMENT IS MADE THAT TO. THAT THE ACTUAL ELECTRIC BILL THAT THE AVERAGE RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PAYS IS ACTUALLY BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE- LARGELY BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOD CLIMATE. AND A STRONG COMMITMENT TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY I THINK THE I THINK YOU. YOU OF GOD INDICATED WE MIGHT BE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACK BUT IT DOES THAT SOUND ACCURATE THAT WE WE'RE WE'RE ACTUALLY BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. YEAH I'M SURE THAT'S ACCURATE I WAS SHOOTING FROM THE HIP A LITTLE BIT WHEN I SAID THAT- METAL ACT I GUESS WORK BY PEOPLE OF THE PACK. OKAY BUT BUT STILL YET- AS AS- THIS DOCUMENT INDICATES AS WELL AS YOUR PRESENTATION I MEAN- CLEARLY WHAT WHEN OUR RATES ARE. DISTINGUISHING ARE THE ELECTRIC RATES FROM THE ACTUAL BILL THE CUSTOMER PAYS- BUT BUT THE RATES BEING DOUBLING AND TRIPLING THAT THAT THAT IS CLEARLY A- CAUSE FOR ALARM AND I DON'T WANT TO. DIMINISH THAT FACT- THE WRITTEN MATERIALS ALSO INDICATES THAT- THAT COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS- ARE CURRENTLY SERVE ABOUT 28% OF THE- I OWE YOU- LOAD- IS THE GROWING PERCENTAGE OF. THE LOAD BEING SERVED BY COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATORS A CONTRIBUTING IN ANY WAY TO THE INCREASES AND- AND- ELECTRIC RATES. AT THE MOMENT IF I MAY I HAVE- ONE OF MY RATES EXPERTS ON THE LINE PULP THE LET'S AND- I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO REFER THAT QUESTION TO HIM IF I MAKE IT SUPERVISOR FOR- OUR ELECTRIC BREAKING. CAN SOMEONE- I'M GONNA KEEP MY CAMERA OFF THIS IS PAUL PHILLIPS I'M HAVING SOME CONNECTIVITY ISSUES WHILE BEING REMOTE SO- AND I BELIEVE YOUR QUESTION IS ABOUT WHETHER A CABINET CHOICE ACT. AGGREGATORS ARE- CREATING MORE PRESSURE ON RATES CENTRALLY THROUGH LOW. IS THAT THE QUESTION YES- I THINK WE CAN SAY IT'S A LITTLE BIT BUT IT'S NOT A PRIMARY FACTOR IN THE RATE PRESSURES THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING SO- YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S EALLY HAPPENING WITH. A CHOICE AGGREGATORS- THAT ARE THERE ARE STILL WORKING THEIR OWN GENERATION PORTFOLIO WHICH GENERALLY IS CHEAPER. R. FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS AND- WHILE MAINTAINING A TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION RATES FROM THE- INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. SO IN DOING SO TECHNICALLY THOSE CUSTOMERS ARE OBVIOUSLY EXPERIENCING ARE POTENTIALLY CHEAPER RATES- BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE NECESSARILY CREATING AS MUCH. PRESSURE ON THE SALES COMPONENT OF RATES AS SAY THE- A ROOFTOP SOLAR CROWD IS SO A DEFECTION TO ROOFTOP SOLAR. IS INCREASING THE ACCELERATION IN DECLINING SALES. OF OUR RATES FASTER THAN THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION OF COMPONENTS OF THE MARKET PLACE YES SO I THINK YOU I WOULDN'T COUNT THAT AS A PRIMARY FACTOR HERE- AS MUCH AS THAT WOULD BE- THAT THE DEFECTION TO. US ON THE ROOFTOP. THE YOU COULD GO. CLARIFY FOR ME LIKE HOW THE DECLINING SALES. MAY TRANSLATE INTO A- AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF INCREASE AND- RATE. AND RATES. SURE SO I MEAN THE BASIC RATE EQUATION- JUST TAKING SORT OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF REVENUE REQUIREMENT FOR AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY AND DIVIDING THAT BY THE KILOWATT HOUR SALES FOR THAT TERRITORY WOULD GIVE YOU A SYSTEM WIDE AVERAGE RATES AND SO THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE'RE BASING THIS ON THAT AS- SMALL PERCENTAGES PER YEAR OF DECLINE IN KILOWATT HOUR SALES RESULTS FROM- GROWTH. IN SOLAR MARKET- MANY CUSTOMERS ARE- PROVIDING THEIR OWN GENERATION FOR THEMSELVES AND THEN YOU KNOW OF COURSE THROUGH THE NET ENERGY METERING TERRACE. OF FEEDING BACK ANY EXCESS GENERATION TO THE GRID AND GETTING A SMALL CREDIT FOR IT- THAT MARKET PLACE IS DRYING YOU KNOW I DON'T OF ITS ON AN INCREASING BASIS BUT IT'S NOT A PRETTY STEADY BASIS- INCREMENTAL DECLINE IN SALES PER YEAR SO AS THE DENOMINATOR. IS SHRINKING- WHILE YOU KNOW REVENUE IS EITHER REMAINING STEADY OR GROWING THOSE RATES ARE INCREASING. OKAY I GET IT- ENTERED AYE MAN YES. YES IF I MADE HIM AND TOOK THE TIME TO MAKE ONE DETECTION SO- WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF CREATED- FAILED TO BROWN- FROM ROOFTOP SOLAR FOR EXAMPLE THOSE- THOSE SAME CAUGHT THEY DON'T NEED TO BE RECOVERED AND SO THERE AND THEN RECOVERED FROM FROM ALL BUNDLED CUSTOMERS- INCLUDING THOSE CUSTOMERS THAT- THAT DON'T HAVE ROOFTOP SOLAR BUT WHEN- WHEN A CUSTOMER GOES TO AT HVGA- IN THEORY THE COSTS GO WITH THEM BECAUSE- WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES THAT- THAT AT SIXTY EIGHT THAT THERE BE A RATEPAYER IN DIFFERENT- A PRINCIPAL THERE- WHEN AT U. K. FORMED IN. SO WE HAVE. VERY COMPLEX AND LITIGIOUS TO REVIEW THE CAUGHT AT TECH WITH THAT EPA CUTS SO CALLED POWER CHARGING WHICH BUT IS AND HOW OF RACE WHICH IS DESIGNED TO DO THAT- BUT THERE ARE THERE- ABOUT- WHICH CONCERT- TO TRANSFER OUT WITH FIFTY KA CUSTOMERS WHEN THEY- WENT OUT LOW DEPART. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- IN TERMS OF ROOFTOP SOLAR. I MEAN IS THERE A- IT IS THERE A THRESHOLD IN TERMS OF THE PERCENTAGE OF ROOFTOP SOLAR AT WHICH WE STARTED SEEING AN IMPACT IN A REDUCTION IN THE TRANSMISSION AND DISPOSITION COSTS. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE. YEAH I DON'T- I DON'T KNOW THAT WE COULD NOT IDENTIFY A SPECIFIC THRESHOLD I THAT AS A RULE OF THUMB- CERTAINLY THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR ROOFTOP SOLAR AND DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES- CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCTION IN TRANSMISSION COSTS AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS AS WELL IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT- THE PC HAS GIVEN A LOT OF THOUGHT TO AND HAS HAS REALLY REVIEWED EXTENSIVELY IN PROCEEDING TO TRY TO DETERMINE IF RELIABLE METHODOLOGY. ANY OTHER QUANTIFY THOSE CAUGHT- COULD BE DEVELOPED AN AND ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION AND FOR THE MOST PART AFTER EXTENSIVE REVIEW REVIEW OF THAT QUESTION HE HAS NOT FOUND THAT THERE ARE- DEFENDABLE METHODOLOGY TO DO THAT AND THAT IS A DISPUTED ISSUE AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE PARTY THAT I BELIEVE THAT THOSE- BUT- THAT. A LARGE AMOUNT OF THOSE COSTS CAN BE AVOIDED WITH KNOWLEDGE THAT SOME OF IT CAN- BUT TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE CAR NOT QUANTIFIED NOT BAD THE CHALLENGE WE DO HAVE A SPECIFIC METHODOLOGY THAT HAPPENED DEVELOP SPORT UTILITY TO FOR EXAMPLE AND- PLANNING THEIR DISTRIBUTION ELECTRIC GRID. BUT LOOK AT THE NEEDS FOR ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE AND TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC PROJECT DONE ON SPECIFIC. A LECTURER. EATERS ARE AREAS OF SYSTEM. THAT COULD ACTUALLY BE DEFERRED- BY A STORAGE PROJECT- AND SO WE HAVE- THE POLICY WHEREBY FUTURE. ARE WE TO GO THE BACK. AND HE YEAH- EXTENT OF THOSE STORAGE PROJECT ANOTHER DISTRIBUTING YOUR RESOURCES COULD BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO BUILDING ANOTHER SUBSTATION OR ANOTHER DISTRIBUTION LINE- WE'VE HAD SOME TALKS WITH BETH AND THAT AREA. AND THOSE ARE EXAMPLES WHERE- WHERE DOES THAT THE BENEFIT OF NOT BUILDING A DISTRIBUTION. A PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE CAN BE SPECIFICALLY TIED TO THE DISTURBING NATURE RESOURCES- BUT- OTHER CONTACT AND BY H. THAT THAT TIE ISN'T SO DIRECT IS WHERE THE DEBATE- CONTINUES TO LIVE- AND- IN THE STAKEHOLDER. COMMUNITY AND THEN ARE PUSHING. BUT IT I UNDERSTAND THAT- IT'S A COMPLICATED ISSUE AND THAT- THE IMPACT OF ROOFTOP SOLAR AS IT RELATES TO. TRANSMISSION COSTS MAY BE YOU KNOW THIS WITHOUT. VERY CONTEXTUAL ESPECIALLY RELATED TO THE PERCENTAGE OF PENETRATION OF ROOFTOP SOLAR- BOB BETTER RIGHT I MEAN IN GENERAL IS THE- YOU KNOW IT IS THERE ANY- AT LEAST CONSIDERATION OF. THE LOWER NEED FOR A TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION FOR ROOFTOP SOLAR THAT'S CALCULATED INTO THE COST SHIFT ANALYSIS- RELATED TO THAT YOU KNOW IN THE ONTEX OF NIGHT NOW SHE METERING. YES SIR- SO WE HAVE- APPRECIATING THAT- A REVIEWS- A METHODOLOGY CALLED A BOYCOTT WHICH BASICALLY LOOK AT- WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS TO THE UTILITY OF REDUCE GENERATION- INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND PURCHASE TO REDUCE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION AS WELL AS THERE ARE METHODOLOGIES AND NETWORKING. THAT QUANTIFY THE BENEFIT OF ABOVE WHAT A TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT I WITH ELABORATING EARLIER IS- BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT THAT AND DISPUTE- AND PARTY THAT BELIEVES THAT THOSE- THOSE. VALUES ARE ARE UNDERSTATED- AND I WAS JUST- ALIVE RATING THAT THAT THE SUBJECT OF- A TECHNICAL. DEBATE ALL RIGHT. THE LAST. FOR MY AND- AS- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO PURSUE ITS GOAL OF HAVING A HUNDRED PERCENT- CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCING OUR ELECTRICITY ARM. IS THAT ARE PROJECTED TO BE- WHY AND AS WE NEED TO EXPAND OUR TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION- GRADE. TO MEET NEW SOURCES OF- SOLAR AND WIND ESPECIALLY OFFSHORE WIND- IS THAT PROJECTED TO BE A- YOU KNOW A- A NAFTA REDUCTION IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW- ELECTRICITY RATES OR A ON A NET INCREASE. I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER WE DID- INTERAGENCY STUDY ON SB ONE HUNDRED AND I'M NOT RECALLING THE TYPICALLY- WHAT THE- THE OVERALL SYSTEM WIDE BILL IMPACT WORD THAT WERE AFFECTED PART OF THAT BODY BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY GET BACK ON THAT I BELIEVE WE HAVE THAT DATA POINT TO GET BACK TO YOU ONE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU THAT THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION- AND I THINK THAT- WITHOUT HAVING LOOKED AT THAT STUDY I WOULD IMAGINE THAT. WOULD PROBABLY ARE ADDING COST- AND SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED TO. FIGURE OUT WAYS TO MINIMIZE THAT- AND- TRANSMISSION IS VERY COSTLY- I THE OF THE- COST ON OTHER- LEGACY- PROGRAMS AT THE CPC WHICH IS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO TAKE A LOOK AT NOT JUST A HONE IN ON THEM I THINK THERE'S A SERIES OF OTHER PROGRAMS WHICH WILL BE A QUESTION FOR THE CPC A COMMISSIONER WITH US AND ACTOR BUT BUT BUT IF WIND AND SOLAR AND WIND AND SOLAR BECOME CHEAPER THAN THAT SAY NATURAL GAS THEN. PERHAPS THAT YOU KNOW IT WOULDN'T BE SO OBVIOUS THAT YOU WOULD BE A CORRECT A DRIVER OF INCREASED HELLO WE ARE ALSO TALKING ABOUT NEW TECHNOLOGIES- THAT WERE WANTING TO INTEGRATE THAT THAT I THINK DESERVE A VERY- THOROUGH ANALYSIS RIGHT- FOR PURPOSES OF LOOKING AT THIS COMPREHENSIVELY BUT THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE STUDY I'M GONNA GUESS NO PROBABLY ABOUT COST CONTACTS YOU KNOW THAT. HEADS OR TAILS WHICH WENT THAT WHICH DIRECTION IS GONNA GO AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY WHAT THE OUTCOME MIGHT BE BUT THAT COULD QUESTIONS TAKE IS A MEMBER- SOME APPRECIATIVE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IT MORE OF A- I THINK POTENTIAL CLOSING COMMENT ON ON THIS ON THIS PANEL BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE SECOND. OR THE SECOND SPEAKER APOLOGIES. YOU KNOW IT JUST IT STRIKES ME THAT WE ARE LIVING IN A TIME IN WHICH TO THE INCREASE OF FOSSIL FUELS AND- ESPECIALLY AT THE- AT THE PUMP. WHEN FOLKS ARE TRYING TO FILL UP THEIR GAS TANK AND- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AS WELL AS THE LEGISLATURE WANTING TO CREATE SOLUTIONS THAT ULTIMATELY HELP PEOPLE BECAUSE COSTS ARE SO EXPENSIVE RIGHT RIGHT NOW AT THE MOMENT. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SEE SOMETHING THAT'S VISIBLE AT SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW YOU ACTUALLY GO YOU FEEL IT IMMEDIATELY. IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT IS DELIVERED IN THE MAIL OR ONLINE WHEN IT COMES TO THE BILLS THAT YOU PAY FOR ENERGY. AND O I'M I'M STRUCK BY THE COMMENTS SHARED BY THE BY THE P. YOU SEE IN TERMS OF NET ENERGY METERING AS RELATED TO ROOFTOP SOLAR. THAT SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN THE P. YOU SEE HAS BEEN MANDATED. TO FIND A FIX FOR THE COST SHIFT. NINE YEARS LATER. THE P. UC HAS STILL NOT ACTED. TO WHEN THEY WILL. IT'S NOW IN JUDICIAL REVIEW IF THEY'RE STILL COMMITTEES THERE'S A NEW DIRECTOR IT'S A CONSTANT HAVING TO START OVER. WHILE RENTERS AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES CONTINUE TO FEEL. THE BURDEN AND YOU KNOW I JUST FIND THAT TO BE A COMPLETE DISREGARD TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO POLICY THAT HAS BEEN SIGNED INTO LAW TO LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WE HAVE BEEN ASKING THESE QUESTIONS FOR MULTIPLE YEARS NOW AND HAVE YET TO ACTUALLY HAVE A CONCLUSION FROM THE P. YOU SEE ON WHEN EXACTLY THEY ARE GOING TO FIX. THE COST SHIFT THAT IMPACTS RENTERS ON LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. THIS FAILURE TO DO SO JUST IS INCREDIBLY TELLING. AT THE LACK OF RESPONSE TOWARDS AGAIN RENTERS ON LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES THAT IS CURRENTLY COSTING THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS AND A PROJECTED COST OF SIX POINT SEVEN BILLION. BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND SO I JUST AGAIN I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT WE HAVE CONTINUOUSLY ASKED THESE QUESTIONS. AND THE PUCT KEEPS DRAGGING AND CHANGING. THE GOAL POST. I'M NOT OKAY WITH THAT AND I DON'T THINK ANY MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE OKAY WITH THE FACT THAT SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN THE PC HAS BEEN MANDATED TO ADDRESS THE COST SHIFT AND HAS FAILED TO DO SO HOW MANY MORE HEARINGS MISTER CHAIR ARE WE GOING TO HAVE BEFORE THEY ACTUALLY DECIDE TO ACT. THAT'S I THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND I WOULD ALIGN MY- COMMENTS WITH THAT YOUR STATEMENTS. I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- MISTER BAKER AND ONE HAS TO DO WITH THE RECENT CQC AUDIT- THE OTHER HAS TO DO MORE SPECIFICALLY TO LEGACY PROGRAMS AND SEE IF. THERE IS. SOME ANALYSIS THAT'S BEEN DONE WE MET WITH THE PRESIDENCY PC HERE NOT LONG AGO- PERHAPS. SOME FOLKS WENT BACK TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT OTHER PROGRAMS MAY BE. LOOKED AT FOR CONSIDERATION GIVEN THE ADDED COST THAT. YOU KNOW WE SEE. TO THE BOTTOM LINE OF UTILITY BILLS. FOR CALIFORNIANS BUT THE FIRST QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH THE RAISE CONCERNS THAT THE AUDIT THAT WAS- DISCLOSE FOR PUBLIC INFORMATION LAST FRIDAY PRESENTS. A RELATED TO WILDFIRE MITIGATION COSTS AND THE RISE. HOW IS THE C. P. U. C. TAKING A LOOK AT- YOU KNOW THE SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE THAT CUSTOMERS. ARE NOT PAYING. MORE THAN WHAT THEY SHOULD AS IT RELATES TO WILDFIRE COSTS THE SECOND QUESTION. HAS TO DO WITH THE LEGACY OF PROGRAMS WE'D LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS. ON WHAT OTHER PROGRAMS WE THE LEGISLATURE. IN COLLABORATION WITH YOU SHOULD BE TAKING A LOOK AT FOR PURPOSES OF- LOOKING AT COSTS. AND REALLY. INVESTING YOU KNOW OUR OUR RESOURCES IN THE AREAS THAT WE'RE- TALKING ABOUT HERE AS A FRONT AND CENTER AGENDA ITEM AND AFFORDABILITY. OF RATES FOR CALIFORNIANS SO THOSE ARE MY TWO QUESTIONS- MISTER BAKER IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO. TAKE A TWO SHOT AT THEM. SO- IN REGARDS TO THE- THE STATE AUDIT FINDINGS- WE'RE IN THE PROCESS- REVIEWING THOSE FINDINGS BAND I'M TAKING ACTION ON THOSE FINDINGS I- TO BE ABLE TO IMPROPER MORE SPECIFICS I'M GONNA HAVE TO- ASK TO GET BACK TO YOU- ARE ON THAT- I DID MENTION EARLIER THAT- WE ARE- OUR- IN OUR REVIEW OF- WILDFIRE WILL RELATED- SPENDING REQUEST WE ARE COLLABORATING EXTENSIVELY WITH OUR SISTER AGENCIES AND WE ARE DEVELOPING METHODOLOGY TO BE ABLE TO TRACK THOSE COSTS AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. AND WE'RE AWARE THAT THAT IS THE MAJOR COST CENTER AND WE WANT WE WANT NEED TO ENSURE THAT THOSE- THOSE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT BEING SPENT WISELY SO HOW TO GET BACK ON THE SPECIFIC- OF OUR RESPONSE BEYOND. THAT- AS FAR THE EYE YOU KNOW WHAT- PROGRAM ARE LOW A PRO THAT- THE- BILL. MAY WISH REVIEW CERTAINLY THERE ARE- A LONG LIST OF- LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED PROGRAMS THAT THEY APPEAR HE IS IMPLEMENTING AN R. AB SIXTY SEVEN UTILITY COSTS RECORD WHICH WAS. KEPT OMITTED ARE ACTUALLY COMMITTED EARLY I BELIEVE OF PERHAPS I KNOW IT'S ON OUR WEBSITE ALREADY- WITH YOU APRIL FIRST- THAT HAS- A FULL ACCOUNTING. OF THOSE COSTS FOR PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAM I'M JUST SCARED CAN NAME A FEW- WE HAD THAT YOU KNOW THAT SPELL- GENERATION AND INCENTIVE- WE HAVE A- NUMBER OF PROGRAMS TO- GIVE ADVANCE THE AT THAT THE PROCUREMENT OF- BIOMASS- WE HAVE- OTHER- TYPES- GREEN POWER PRO. AND SO- DOES DOES DOES DOES PROGRAMS SOME OF WHICH- HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY THE LEGISLATURE PERSPECTIVE A PUBLIC POLICY PURPOSES- AND SOME OF THEM- ARE AUTHORIZED FOR SPECIFIC- YOU KNOW- COST EFFECTIVENESS REASON ENERGY EFFICIENCY AS AN EXAMPLE- THE PC HAS BEEN PURSUING ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS FOR DECADES BECAUSE THERE ARE FOUND TO BE COST EFFECTIVE ALL OF OUR ALL. OF THE REQUIRED TO BE COST EFFECTIVE- AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT PROGRAMS HAVE CAUGHT THE PECTIN THIS REQUIREMENT I THINK WE CAN HAVE SOME INSURANCE THAT- YEAH WE HAVE A APPROACH IS TO ENSURE THAT THAT- DOES PREPARE DOLLARS ARE ARE ARE. BEING- ALLOCATED ACCORDINGLY. THANK YOU I LOOK FOR TO HVING A MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE CONVERSATION. ON THE LONG LIST OF- PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED IN PAGES FIFTY FIFTY NINE OF. OF THAT REPORT- BECAUSE I THINK IT'S- IT'S WORTH THE TIME GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WERE. CONFRONTING OR ATTEMPTING TO CONFRONT HERE- THE CPUC CONTINUES TO APPROVED RATE INCREASES. IN SOME CASES MAY BE JUSTIFIED AND OTHERS QUESTIONABLE- AND SO LOOKING AT ALL OF THE PROGRAMS I THINK- IS MERITED- FOR FUTURE DISCUSSIONS LOOK I KNOW WE HAVE A FISCAL POLICY TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE- BUT I I'M- I'M THINKING THAT THAT. ISSUES THAT COME THROUGH HERE. I THINK THE PRIOR CHAIR COULD POTENTIALLY AGREE WITH THIS IN A LINE WITH THIS OUTLOOK IN THAT WE HAVE TO START LOOKING AT. THE ENERGY UTILITY PUBLIC POLICY IN THIS COMMITTEE THROUGH THE LENS OF WISSICK AND INCREASED COSTS. COM OR OR NOT AND- AND THAT COULD BE AT A THRESHOLD OF HOW WE- LEGISLATE IN THIS COMMITTEE TO. TO HELP OUR APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE- DO SOME PRELIMINARY WORK. BUT ALSO TO HELP CALIFORNIANS WITH THE BOTTOM LINE OF- WHAT THE COST OF UTILITY RATES IN THAT ALSO INTERSECTS WITH OUR- DISCUSSIONS RELATED TO OUR AMBITIOUS CLIMATE AND RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS. AND THAT'S A REAL FACT- AND THAT'S COMING FROM ONE THAT IS AS STRONG SUPPORTER OF. RETIREMENT POLICY CENTER RENEWABLE ENERGY POLICY SO WE JUST HAVE TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR STATE- ARE HURTING AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THINGS THROUGH THAT LENS SO- THANK YOU SO MUCH. MISTER MAKER I HAVE NO OTHER QUESTIONS I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR YOU WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE I WOULD IMAGINE WE WILL SEE YOU. VERY SOON AGAIN- TO HAVE SOME OF THESE- DISCUSSIONS TO GET AN UPDATE TO GET INTO THE WEEDS OF THINGS BUT- AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY I'M GOING TO PAUSE REAL QUICKLY THE INFORMATION HEARING. SO THAT WE CAN GO THROUGH THE LIST OF ADD ONS TO THE TWO BILLS THAT WERE HEARD EARLIER. AND SO FOR THAT WE'RE GOING TO. RECESS ARE HEARING OF FOR PURPOSES OF GOING BACK TO OUR REGULAR A UTILITIES AND ENERGY HEARING- TO CALL THE ROLL ON THE TWO BILLS THAT- THAT WOULD HURT SO MA'AM SECRETARY I THINK I HAVE TO DO. THAT AND THEN- WE ARE NOW- CALLING RECONVENING THE MEETING OF THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE FOR ADD ONS. THE ITEM ONE A. B. NINETEEN SIXTY THE MOTION IS DUE PASS. ITEM NUMBER TWO AB TWENTY THREE ZERO TO THE MOTION IS DUE PASS AS AMENDED TO NATURAL RESOURCES. EDUARDO GARCIA HI. EDUARDO GARCIA I CARILLO. CARILLO I. MAYES REYES SANTIAGO TANG. THAT'S NINE ZERO RELATIVE THE ROLE OPEN ON THAT ITEM. SO WE'RE GOING TO RECESS ARE HEARING AND DIGGING AND DO THAT AGAIN AND THEN WE WILL RECONVENE AS THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING FOR THE TWO IS AN ENERGY COMMITTEE AND WITH THAT I'M GOING TO INVITE OUR NEXT SPEAKER IT'S A MISTER MARK TONY FROM THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK. WELCOME. MY NAME IS MARK TONY I SERVE AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF TURN THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK I WANT TO THANK CHAIR GARCIA FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN ADDRESSING THE MONTHLY BILL AFFORDABILITY CRISIS FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING AND I'D LIKE TO THANK EACH OF YOU FOR ATTENDING TODAY I- YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. WANT THE MOST GREEN FOR THE SCREEN POLLS CONSISTENTLY SHOW OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FOR INVESTING IN STRATEGIES THAT REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS AND SAVE THE PLANET FROM THE RAVAGES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. NOBODY WANTS THE COST OF GREENING THE GRID TO BE CUTTING OFF BLACK BROWN INDIGENOUS ART ANY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES FROM THE GREAT BECAUSE THE PRICES ARE TOO DOGGONE HIGH. YOU KNOW THE THING I HAVE TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT THE RATES VERSUS BILLS DISCUSSION EARLIER BECAUSE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. UTILITY BILLS DO NOT EXIST IN A VACUUM. YOU DO NOT HAVE A GASOLINE BILL IN OTHER WORDS YOU DON'T PAY FOR GASOLINE UNLESS YOU OWN AN AUTOMOBILE OKAY YOU'RE NOT JUST BY SO YOU DON'T HAVE UTILITY BILL UNLESS YOU HAVE A HOME TO LIVE IN. AND SO WHILE IT MAY BE THAT THE COST OF ENERGY BILLS IN CALIFORNIA IS. RELATIVELY LOW COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE COUNTRY I GUARANTEE YOU THAT THE HEALTH THE PRICE THE PRICE OF LIVING. IN CALIFORNIA PERHAPS THE NATION AND YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT UTILITY BILLS AS A BUNDLE UTILITY IS PART OF HOUSING. THE UTILITY BILLS AND WHEN IT OES UP TWENTY DOLLARS A MONTH THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH. FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH LIKE SOME OF THESE PROPOSALS WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. THAT IS WHAT'S HURTING PEOPLE. FOR ALL TODAY I AM GOING TO OFFER FOUR DISTINCT STRATEGIES. FOR CONTAINING COUGH AND CONTROLLING BILLS. EACH THAT ARE WITHIN THE AUTHORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE TO WIN THAT. ONE DEVELOP NON RATE PAIR FUNDING STREAMS FOR ONCE IN A- GENERATION COSTS THAT ARE EXTRAORDINARY. YET URGENT. REPAIRS HAVE ALREADY PAID IN WILDFIRE MITIGATION COSTS SIX POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS WITH BILLIONS MORE PROPOSED. THE LEGISLATURE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE ECONOMIC AND REYES EQUITY BY ADOPTING TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR WILDFIRE MITIGATION TO REPLACE RATEPAYER FUNDING REDUCING WILDFIRE PARTICULAR EMISSIONS ADVANCED STATE CLIMATE GOALS AND HEALTH OUTCOMES ESPECIALLY FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES MOST AT RISK. THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO REPLACE REPAIR FUNDING OF CLIMATE INITIATIVE THROUGH STATE FUNDING. I'D LIKE TO GIVE ONE SPECIFIC EXAMPLE THE LEGISLATURE CAN UTILIZE THE NINE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO MILLION MILLION DOLLARS FOUR BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET TO REPLACE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON REQUEST FOR SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN RAPE THEIR FUNDING FOR BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION THAT'S JUST ONE SPECIFIC EXAMPLE LEGISLATURE COULD ADOPT IS TO REQUIRE THE CPC TO REVIEW INFLATION CONSTRAIN PROPOSALS. AND THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF RATE INCREASE PROPOSALS PRIOR TO APPROVING ANY RATE INCREASE. OVER THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS THE COMMISSION A FLAP EDISON CUSTOMERS WITH A 20% INCREASE BY APPROVING TWO POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN RATE INCREASES. FOR PG&amp;E CUSTOMERS IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO ALONE. IT IS NEARLY 20% INCREASE. AND THAT REPRESENTS ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG BECAUSE THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE 30% PROPOSED. GENERAL RATE INCREASE THAT WOULD START IN TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THE LEGISLATURE CAN REQUIRE UTILITIES TO SUBMIT INFLATION CONSTRAINED RATE PROPOSAL. A LONG FIVE OF THEIR SKY'S THE LIMIT INCREASE PROPOSAL FOR THAT WAY INSTEAD OF THE CPU FREE. ONLY USING THE SKY HIGH PROPOSAL AT THE STARTING POINT AND THEN HAVING TO WORK DOWN. THE PC WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE INFLATION OF THE STARTING POINT. AND REQUIRE THE UTILITY TO JUSTIFY EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR OVER INFLATION. DARTING POINTS MAKE A DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO DO BUDGETING AND IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT RATE PAYERS ON THE SUGGEST THAT HAVING A LOWER STARTING POINT TO START WITH. GIVEN ADVANTAGE TO A STARTING POINT BUT HAS NO LIMIT WHATSOEVER RIGHT NOW THE PROBLEM IS THE UTILITIES CAN ASK FOR WHATEVER THEY WANT ANYTIME THEY WANT. AND THE THREE P. THREE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO GRANT AS LARGE OF AN INCREASE AS IT DEEMS FIT WHENEVER IT WANTS THERE ARE NO CONSTRAINTS AT ALL BUT THE LEGISLATURE CAN AT LEAST HELP PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE. THREE THE THIRD STRATEGY ADOPT POINT OF SALE AND OTHER REVENUE GENERATING STRATEGIES TO HELP CALIFORNIA MEET ITS CLIMATE GOALS. THAT HAVE TO PARTICULAR FEATURES ZERO RATEPAYER DOLLARS LET ME GIVE JUST ONE EXAMPLE. SO TURNER'S BEEN FLOATING A PROPOSAL ON TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION THAT WOULD REPLACE RATEPAYER REVENUE WITH POINT TO FILL REVENUE. AND THIS IS HOW IT WORKS SO THE AVERAGE PRICE OF A NEW CAR IN CALIFORNIA IS ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FORTY EIGHT IN CHANGE BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA FADE FIFTY JUST MAKE THE MAPPING THING. 32% CARBON FEE OKAY MAYBE ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER VEHICLE NOW YOU TAKE THE FACT THAT THERE'S ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION NEW VEHICLES THAT OPERATE BY THE AFFLUENT AND SOLD EVERY YEAR MULTIPLY THAT BY THE THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU GET ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO BUY DOWN THE COST. OF THE V. THE BILL CHARGING STATIONS AND TO DO OTHER INVESTMENTS. NOW THAT HAPPENED TO THE CAR DEALERSHIP THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL FOR THAT IF A CUSTOMER COMPLAINS WHY FOR THE PAY THE THOUSAND DOLLAR FOR THIS CURVE IN FEET. THEY CAN BE DIRECTED TO AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE WHOSE COST IS LOWER BECAUSE OF DEFEAT. I WILL JUST SAY OF THE NOTE THAT THIS PARTICULAR PRO PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT'S LOCATED AT CAR DEALERSHIPS. WOULD EXEMPT PATHOLOGICAL. WHICH I ACTUALLY DON'T NEED ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIES BECAUSE 80% OF CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE TOUGH FOR VEHICLES AND THE FACT IS THAT IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TOUGH FOR WITH THE NUMBER TWO CAR SELLERS IN THE STATE JEFF AFTER TOYOTA AHEAD OF HONDA I DON'T BELIEVE TESLA ACTUALLY NEED SUBSIDIES AT THIS POINT THEY ARE VERY SUCCESFUL L. ONE MYSELF NO SERIOUSLY THEY ARE FOR. THEM TO GO TO- GO TO NUMBER FOUR BECAUSE I WANNA KEEP MY REMARKS RELATIVELY SHORT SO THAT WE CAN- YOU KNOW GET INTO A DISCUSSION. SO THE FOR AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND IT SPEAKS TO WHAT SHERMAN GARCIA JEFF SAID. I'M GOING TO SUGGEST THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATORS TO STOP ADOPTING CLEAN ENERGY MANDATES THAT INCREASE MONTHLY RATE PAYER BILLS. AND I THOUGHT ABOUT THIS A LOT IF I GET UPSET A LOT WHEN I SEE BILLS THAT ARE PASSED BY BY THIS COMMITTEE AND BY YOUR COLLEAGUES THEY'RE GONNA RAISE RAISE RATES BUT WHAT I REALIZE IS ACTUALLY WHAT CHAIR GARCIA DID. BUT A LOT OF TIMES ALL YOU HAVE TO. OPERATE IS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. TO ANALYZE THE COUGH THE BILLS AND THEN ONLY ANALYZE THE COUGH THE STATE AGENCY TO IMPLEMENT THEY DO NOT ANALYZE THE RATEPAYER IMPACT WHICH YOU BROUGHT UP OKAY AND I APPRECIATE THAT I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF A RECENTLY PASSED BILL- AB EIGHT FORTY ONE. WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST WITH THAT IS THAT THE ESTIMATED TOTAL FISCAL IMPACT FOR ADDITIONAL STAFFING COSTS FOR CARD NCPC THE EMPLOYMENT THE BILL THIS IS ABOUT SCHOOL ENERGY EFFICIENCY WITH LEFT A MILLION DOLLARS. NO THAT'S WHAT YOU THOUGHT AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT LESS THAN A MILLION DOLLARS I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING OKAY THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE TOO MUCH. BUT YOU DID NOT SEE THAT SENSE BUT BILL WITH IMPLEMENTED THE ACTUAL COST TO RATEPAYERS HAS BEEN SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS. THE FORMER FOR UNDER MILLION MY RECORD. IS THAT THIS COMMITTEE REQUIRE THE THREE PS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS OR UNITED THEY CAN PASS IT ALONG BUT YOU ASK THEM TO DO A RATEPAYER. IMPACT ANALYSIS ON ALL BILLS THAT MAY HAVE A RATE SO THAT YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION IN FRONT OF YOU YOU NEED IT'S CRITICAL FOR YOU TO HAVE COMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT RATEPAYER IMPACT. SO THAT YOU CAN STOP. ADOPTING RATE INCREASES WITHOUT YOUR KNOWLEDGE WHICH IS WHAT I ACTUALLY BELIEVE HAS BEEN HAPPENING YOU NEED THE INFORMATION THERE THE WAY THEY GET IT BUT YOU'VE GOT TO GET IT DIRECTLY FROM THE P. THREE. AND I DON'T THINK LEGISLATIVE- ANALYSTS OFFICE HAVETHE RESOURCES TO DO THAT MY FINAL COMMENT IS. RAVING THE RATES OF ELECTRICITY TWO HIGH UNDERMINE CALIFORNIA CLIMATE GOALS BECAUSE IT'S A DISINCENTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO WANT TO SWITCH TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO ELECTRIC APPLIANCES IF THE COST OF ELECTRICITY IS MORE THAN THE COST OF FOSSIL FUELS IF WE REALLY WANT TO INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO SWITCH TO ELECTRICITY WE OUGHT TO BE TALKING ABOUT CUTTING THE COST OF ELECTRICITY BY HALF I'M TELLING YOU IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DO. THAT PEOPLE WOULD RUSH SHE SWITCHED ELECTRICITY RIGHT NOW A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS THAT CONFERS WITH GREATLY THANK YOU I'M OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS ANY MEMBER HAVE THANK YOU YOU SOUND LIKE A VERY PASSIONATE UTILITY ADVOCATE- RIGHT PAYER ADVOCATE- AND LET ME BE THE FIRST DAY THAT HE LINE MUST JUST HIT YOU ON TWITTER FOR YOUR COMMENT I'M JUST KIDDING. FACULTY SAID I'VE JUST. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS FROM OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR I'M A REPORT. GOOD TO SEE MARK- FIFTY FIRST OF ALL I DO AGREE IF WE COULD- CUT THE RATE IN HALF THAT WE WOULD GET A LOT MORE- AS A PATIENT WE GET A LOT MORE- PEOPLE WANTING TO GO ELECTRIC THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND- AND- CERTAINLY. MOST YEARS WE DON'T HAVE MONEY IN THE GENERAL FUND THIS YEAR WE DO- CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE SHOULD CONSIDER- IS USING GENERAL FUND MONEY FOR. THINGS THAT PROMOTE OUR CLIMATE GOALS OF RATHER THAN RATEPAYER MONEY I AND I THINK THAT MAKES SOME SENSE WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THOUGH IS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE RATE. ARE HAVING ESSENTIALLY THE C. P. U. C. TECA. A CLOSER LOOK AT THE RATES WHICH IS FINE BUT TO LIMITED TO INFLATION LET'S FACE IT. RIGHT NOW WILL WHILE FIRING MITIGATION IS A BIG COST FOR PG&amp;E ARE WE GONNA TELL THEM UP SORRY YOU CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU THE RATE INCREASE OR SOMETHING ELSE. SO THAT'S MY CONCERN WHAT IS ITTHAT THE FUTILITY IS DON'T DO. THAT THEY MIGHT DO IF YOU ALLOWED THAN THAT LARGER RATE INCREASE AND I CERTAINLY AGREE WE SHOULD LOOK AT EVERYTHING THAT'S BEING DONE. BUT HOW DO WE KNOW HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE. WHAT IS IT YOU THINK THAT THEY MIGHT BE DOING THAT THEY CAN'T DO I GUESS THAT'S THE REAL QUESTION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COURT I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION IT'S A FAIR QUESTION. THERE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF RESPONSES ONE IS THAT. WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE RECENTLY RELEASED- CLIMATE PLAN ZERO- 100% CLEAN ENERGY CLIMATE PLAN THAT WAS RECENTLY RELEASED BY MUD. THE SACRAMENTO MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT. THEY HAVE A COMMITMENT TO REACHING THEIR GOALS AND- STAYING WITHIN- INFLATION IN TERMS OF- OF INCREASES SO I JUST WANT TO GIVE THAT OF THE OF THE QUICK POINT. I THINK PART OF IT IS THAT. THE UTILITIES CAN'T DO IT ALONE I DO THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND I THINK PARTICULARLY WITH BOB FIRE COUGH PART OF MY POINT IS THAT. THE EMISSIONS CAUSED BY WILDFIRES REALLY DRAG US BACK THE WHOLE STATE BACK ALL THE MONEY WE SPEND IT DRAGS US BACK WHEN IT COMES TO REACHING OUR CLIMATE GOALS AND OFF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH GOAL FOR I THINK THAT THERE IS. A CASE TO BE MADE THAT- SOME OF THE WILDFIRE COUGH- AND ALSO BECAUSE WE NEED TO DO IT QUICKLY OKAY WE JUST CAN'T WAIT FOR YEARS AND YEARS. THAT THERE THIS IS THE TYPE OF EXTRAORDINARY ONCE IN A GENERATION URGENT COSTS THAT I AM GOING TO SUGGEST THAT IF APPROPRIATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE. I AM FROM COLLEAGUES THAT ARE WONDERING ABOUT SHOULD WE PUT THE CARE PROGRAM ON. THE STATE BUDGET I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I'M JUST BUT I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW THAT I DON'T THINK THAT SUCH A GREAT IDEA BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A STATE SURPLUS I KNOW THAT FROM BEING. I WOULD RATHER HAVE A SURPLUS BE INVESTED IN SOMETHING THAT PAYS OFF OVER A GENERATION AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF THESE WILDFIRE MITIGATION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WILL PAY OFF FOR GENERATIONS THAT I. I THINK THAT PART OF IT IS THAT YOU'RE RIGHT SOME STUFF UTILITIES WON'T BE ABLE TO DO BUT THAT BACK FROM WHERE WE NEED MORE COORDINATION AND PARTNERSHIP NOW MY GUESS IS. THAT THE STATE BUDGET. BEING LARGER THE WE HAD. GOES AWAY PRETTY QUICKLY BUT I AM THRILLED WITH YOU. I JUST I'M NOT SURE THAT'S A SOLUTION BUT IF WE COULD IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THINGS WERE GOING TO MY RIGHT ANY QUESTIONS FROM ANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES. MISTER MURPHY G. ALL RIGHT- WELCOME MR TONY- FIRST OF ALL I HERE HERE OPENING PHRASE MOST GREEN FOR LEASE SCREEN I THINK WE CAN ALL COULD APPRECIATE THAT BUT- BUT IT BUT THEN YOU KNOW WE AT AND WHEN WE START GETTING INTO A- DID IT TO SOME OF THE- THE ENGINE TO GETTING INTO THE WEEDS I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT GETS MORE COMPLICATED LIKE. LIKE FOR EXAMPLE YOUR YOUR YOUR THIRD PROPOSAL- POINT OF SALE- YOU KNOW YOU COSTS ARE YEAH I MEAN. I THINK I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS BUT- YOU KNOW ME ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD BE A TAX ON GAS POWERED CARS RIGHT YEAH BUT BUT THAT WOULD GO TO THE ECONOMIC REALITY THAT- MISS CARDIO WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER ABOUT. YOU KNOW. FOR MOST WORKING FOLKS. THEY CAN'T AFFORD ELECTRIC CAR AND SO YOU KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE A HIGHER TAX ON. ON WORKING FOLKS DRIVING GAS CARS AS OPPOSED TO YOU KNOW FOLKS DRIVING TESLAS MAN HAVE HAD HOW DO YOU IT SEEMS LIKE A- YEAH IT'S IT SEEMS CONTRADICTORY ON THE ON THE ONE HAND YOUR YOUR AIR ADVOCATING FOR- YOU KNOW MORE MORE AFFORDABLE- UTILITY RATES- BUT ON THE OTHER HAND- OVER INCREASING COSTS IS FOR. IN IN IN IN WAYS THAT THEY THAT THAT WOULD IMPACT WORKING CLASS FOLKS THE MOST. THANK YOU FOR ASKING BETTER ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI SO LET ME GO BACK TO MY EXAMPLE WE'VE GOT I'M TALKING ABOUT NEW VEHICLES IN THE FERRET OUT WITH NOT USED VEHICLES. SO THE FACT IS THAT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IF THE AVERAGE COST OF A NEW VEHICLE. AND I'M TALKING ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BE TACKED ON THE IDEA IS THAT A COMPARABLE ELECTRIC CART WHAT WHAT IF YOU COULD MAKE THE ELECTRIC CAR FORTY THOUSAND THE COMPARABLE OR THIRTY THOUSAND OKAY NOW. WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS MAKING IT ECONOMICALLY VIABLE. THE OTHER THING IS THAT THE COST OF MAINTAINING AN ELECTRIC CAR HE FELL FAR BELOW GASOLINE CAR I MEAN I'M TELLING YOU FROM EXPERIENCE IT'S VIRTUALLY NOTHING AND SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE I UNDERSTAND THE FEARS THAT PEOPLE HAVE. BUT I WILL SAY AS AN ELECTRIC CAR DRIVER THE COST THE ONGOING MONTHLY COSTS ARE FAR LOWER SO I BELIEVE THAT IF WE CAN REDUCE THE COST OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE TO BE LOW THE COST OF A GASOLINE VEHICLE. AND THEN WHAT THE COST OF OWNERSHIP OF AWFUL LOWER. BUT THAT HELPS WORKING FAMILIES. IF I LOOK AT IT. PARAPET YEAH THANK GUESS THE CHALLENGE WOULD BE. WELL I CAN SEE A LOT OF CHALLENGES BUT- I GET YOUR POINT I AND I AND I APPRECIATE YOUR POINT BUT BRING IT BACK TO- ELECTRIC RATES IN AN AWAY FROM FROM FROM FROM CARS- YOUR YOUR YOUR FIRST PROPOSAL ABOUT THE- YOU KNOW. HOW WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR MITIGATIONS LIKE BUILDING ELECTRIC ELECTRIFICATION THROUGH NON RATE PAIR- APPROACHES IN AND THEN YOU MENTIONED. I IT WASN'T EVEN AWARE THIS THING I PROBABLY SHOULD BE BETTER. SO OUR RATE PAYERS BEING CHARGED FOR. FOUR BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION. THERE IS A CURRENT PROPOSAL THAT HAS BEEN SUBMITTED BY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON. TO ELECTRIFY TEN THOUSAND HOMES. FOR THE COST OF SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION RATEPAYER DOLLARS. NOT NOT. HERE'S THE THING. OF ALL THE HOMES IN CALIFORNIA THERE ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION UNITS. IT PRODUCES- 7% OF ALL CARBON EMISSIONS COME FROM RESIDENTIAL WHAT THAT MEANS BASICALLY IF IN ORDER TO HAVE A 1% REDUCTION YOU NEED TO MILLION HOMES TO BE ELECTRIFIED. AND YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I'M LOOKING AT YOU CAN EITHER HAVE TO GO BIG OR GO HOME WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION TEN THOUSAND HOME FOR SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. TO TEN THOUSAND IT YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE- THAT THE PROPOSAL WE'VE BEEN FLOATING. IS WHAT IF YOU REQUIRED AS A CONDITION. OF CLOTHING OFF GROW. ON THE FINGER FAMILY HOME. THAT COULD BE CONVERTED TO ELECTRIC HOT WATER THAT'S FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES A YEAR THAT SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL HOMES THAT ARE FULL IN CALIFORNIA BUT THAT BUT THAT AGAIN YOU KNOWWITH THE SIMILAR TO THE GAS POWERED THE TAX ON THE GAS CARS IT WOULD ADD TO THE AFFORDABILITY AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT IT I WILL SAY THAT FINANCE. THAT CONVERSION AT MORTGAGE RATES WHICH IS ABOUT THE LOWEST KIND OF RATES THAT MOST EVERYDAY CONSUMERS HAVE AVAILABLE TO THEM. IT IT IT. IT'S NOT A PERFECT SOLUTION BY ANY MEANS WHAT IT IS IT'S A BIG SOLUTION IF THE GOAL BIG CONCEPT THE TABLE IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH GO BIG FAT WHAT I'M HOPING IS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE. TURNS GO BIG CONCEPT TO COME UP WITH THEIR OWN GO TO BE CONCEPT SO I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU. SOME OF THE PROPOSALS THAT BURN. WITHOUT IT'S NOT THAT WE THINK IT'S EASY. TO GET ADOPTED OR WE THINK THIS IS THE BEST BUT- WE NEED BIG IDEAS ON THE TABLE HERE'S OUR FONG. AND LAST TO- YOUR YOUR POINT THAT CLEAN ENERGY MANDATE SHOULDN'T IMPACT THE RATE PAYERS. BUT I MEAN YOU WOULD YOU WOULD ADMIT THAT- THAT THIS IS YOU KNOW INTERNALIZING COSTS CAN BE DIFFICULT LIKE HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU HOW DO WE INTERNALIZE THE COSTS YOU KNOW. OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN TERMS OF- OF EVER INCREASING WORLDWIDE FIRE COSTS YOU KNOW PUBLIC HEALTH COSTS OF YOU KNOW THE ALL THE- SMOKE- THAT THAT THAT OUR KIDS ARE BREATHING AND FROM FROM ALL THE WILD FIRES ME IT'S NOT JUST RATEPAYER. IMPACT ANALYSIS RATE I MEAN WE ALSO NEED TO CONSIDER- THAT THE COSTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE- ABSOLUTELY WHAT WHAT WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT RATEPAYERS HAVE ALREADY INVESTED BILLIONS IN DECARBONISING. THE THE GENERATION. IN CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING. DECARBONIZATION AND TRANSPORTATION THAT THE TRANSPORTATION AND BUILDING FACTOR PITCH IN AND PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE OF REVENUE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT IT IS EXACTLY BECAUSE OF THE REASON THAT WILDFIRES IMPACT FAR MORE THAN RATE PAYERS. THAT WE BELIEVE IT IS JUSTIFIABLE TO LOOK FOR REVENUE FROM OTHER FACTORS TO COMPLEMENT WHAT RAPIER FOR PAYING. THAT'S THE BASIC PRINCIPLE. I THANK YOU. THANK YOU QUESTIONS FROM SOME MEMBERS OF THAT YOU HAVE A QUESTION AND WHEN I CAN ADD ON TO THE CONSENT CALENDAR WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED ONCE AGAIN RECESSED. FOR THE HEARING IN A MINUTE AND NOT APPRECIATE THEM THANK YOU AND I DON'T AND I WANT TO APPRECIATE YOUR WORKING IN TERMS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. HELP PREPARE THE TICKLING THOSE WHO ARE STRUGGLING THE MOST IN THE AND I'VE SEEN SOME OF YOUR ADVOCACY OVER THE YEARS AND I'VE LEARNED TO APPRECIATE QUITE A BIT. AS YOU KNOW WE'RE WORKING ON IT WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN OFFICE IN YOUR OFFICE. I'M FROM THE PUBLIC PURPOSE PRO. IS THE ONE. OF THOUGHT IS THAT. CONTROLS ABOUT BILLS IN A IN A HEARING ONE SCHOOL OF THOUGHT IS THAT- IS WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING WHICH IS. WE FIND ANOTHER SOURCE OF INCOME- I'M USING THAT. WORD LOOSELY INCOME- ANOTHER SCHOOL OF THOUGHT IS THAT WE USE A STATE REVENUE THE STATE REVENUES- OR- SURPLUSES THAT- IN ORDER TO. ALLEVIATE A RATEPAYER. N. AND YOU KNOW THE STRUGGLE IS YOU KNOW WHICH REPAIRS TO PAY WHICH ONES. SHOULD PAY FOR WHAT SERVICES AND FOR WHO AND OFTEN TIMES. WHEN WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS. IT IS ONE GROUP OF RATEPAYERS WHO. BURDEN THIS THE MOST AND IN MANY CASES. ARE THOSE WHO ARE LEAST ABLE TO ECONOMICALLY BURDENED THIS THE MOST. FOR THE GREATER GOOD. OUT WITH A PUSH YOU A LITTLE BIT ON ON ON A COUPLE OF THOSE CONTENT HERE. I THINK OUR CULTURE. HAVE PUSHED BUT WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE. TO PUSH BECAUSE- IF IT'S- THIS. REVENUE IS ONE WHETHER WE JUST IT AS A SO TODAY OR WOULD WE DESCRIBED AS ON. REVENUE AND I HEAR YOUR CAUTION I THINK IT'S- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT YOU HAD SAID THAT. IF THERE IS A DIP IN STATE REVENUES WILL THEN WHAT HAPPENS IF PROGRAMS AT THAT I GET THAT. BUT ON THE PUSH A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE STATE REVENUES. A PIECE OF IT- AND IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE- IN PAIN WHEN WE WHEN YOU GO BACK INTO- LIKE MY COLLEAGUE AND- HAD A QUESTION YOU WALKED INTO- THESE- OTHER. THE AREAS WHERE WE CAN INCREASE. OUR REVENUE FORTY SAID PROGRAMS REVENUE AT LEAST FOR ME WOULD BE TO ALLEVIATE THE BURDEN ON THIS POPULATION WHO HAS WHO WHO IS LEAST ABLE TO PAPER PAYS THE MOST IN MANY CASES FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS. I'M A PRESS ON THAT THAT LITTLE BIT LONGER IT AND IF YOU ARE THINKING OF OTHER AREAS- I'M- HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T CONTINUE TO BURDEN. THAT SAME POPULATION. WHO WERE ASKING NOT TO BE BIRD AND LOOK W'VE GOT TO BE. REALISTIC ABOUT THE MOUNTAINS TO CLIMB WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR NEW ADDITIONAL REVENUES TO PAY FOR THESE PROGRAMS EVEN IF THE WELL INTENTIONED. THE IN A MAGIC WORLD. YOU YOU HIT THE GYM IN THE BOTTOM OF THE TICKET THE PROGRAM BECAUSE WE WANT TO HELP A CERTAIN POPULATION. NOT CONTINUE TO LAYER LAYER LAYER LAYER- WHEN THEY DON'T BENEFIT THE MEDIA. THE WELL THEY DON'T REAP THE MANY BENEFITS OF THOSE PROGRAMS. SOME PUSHING A LOT MY SATELLITE BUT BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I HAVE CONFIDENCE. IN YOUR HEAD IN YOUR BILL YOU GIVING YOUR DEEP KNOWLEDGE AND WORK IN THIS AREA THAT YOU GET. YOUR PRETTY LITTLE BIT ON THAT PPP FOR STATE FUNDING AND- OTHER THOUGHTS OF WHAT EQUITY IN MIND AS- WELL ASSEMBLY MEMBER FUND PICKLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION. I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF WAYS TO GO ON THIS. ONE IS. I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT STATE REVENUE CONTRIBUTIONS OKAY. I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO DEPEND ON IT I'M GOING BUT THERE ARE SOME WAYS. SO FOR INSTANCE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT. THESE HUGE CAPITAL PROJECTS- THAT THAT HAVE TO DO WITH UNDERGROUNDING LINES. COVERED CONDUCTORS A LOT OF THE- CAPITAL INVESTMENT FOR WILDFIRE. MITIGATION MANY QATAR FOR SECOND THING I DID NO NO NO NO I'VE- TO SAY. WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING SOME OF THESE GOOD PROGRAMS. THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FIGHTING CLIMATE CHANGE TO OUR FULL ABILITY. FOR THAT TO SAY THAT BE SORRY OKAY I'M SORRY THE PHARMACY CARE TO JUMP IN. OKAY SO. I PART OF WHAT I AM WE'D LIKE TO LARGEST TO CAN IS OUR CERTAIN. AND INVESTMENTS THERE ARE SUITABLE FOR PUBLIC FINANCING THROUGH- THROUGH BOND FOR INSTANCE THAT ARE REPAID THROUGH THAT AT THE END OF THE- YOU KNOW THAT ARE REPAID THROUGH DEDICATED- YOU KNOW REVENUE STREAMS TAXPAYER REVENUE STREAMS THAT'S AS BONFIRE SO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S ONE THING WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT AND THINKING ABOUT. I AT OUTLOOK BROUGHT UP BEFORE THE COST OF THE FOLDER FOR UP THIRTIES. THE OVERPAYMENT IS FAR MORE THAN THE PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAM. IT'S ABOUT DOUBLE RIGHT NOW SO THERE ARE WAYS THERE ARE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE TO KIND OF BRING THINGS BACK A LITTLE BIT MORE INTO KILTER. PROVIDE SOME RATE RELIEF AND PROTECT THE PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME OF CARE CUSTOMERS. I TELL YOU SOMETHING INTERESTING B. FOR THE PANDEMIC. OUR UTILITY SHUT OFF A GROWN TO OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND PER YEAR EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND PER YEAR. AND WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE RESEARCH AND WE LOOK AT WHO'S GETTING SHUT OFF. THE INCREASED RATE WAS ACTUALLY HIGHER AMONG NON CARE CUSTOMERS THE ONES CARE CUSTOMERS PART OF WHAT METHOD I WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE HERE IS THAT THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS ABSOLUTELY EXIST AMONG THEIR CUSTOMERS. BUT ALSO EXIST AMONG MANY MORE CUSTOMERS THE DEATH CARE CUSTOMERS SO PART OF IT IS THAT IN ORDER TO RESOLVE AND ADDRESS THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS WE HAVE TO RIGHT AWAY TO BRING DOWN THE COST FOR EVERYBODY. INCLUDING QUITE FRANKLY V. COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL SECTOR I KNOW THAT NOT RESIDENTIAL BUT I HAVE TO CALL THEM OUT BECAUSE THEY PASS ON THEIR INCREASES. THE FED PEOPLE PAYING THE MONTHLY RESIDENTIAL BILLS FLOW I DO THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TOGETHER AS PARTNERS HOW DO WE GET. A LITTLE BIT OUT OF CONTROL AND PARAMETERS AROUND THESE RATE INCREASES. THANK YOU COULD QUESTION I THINK IT THAT LAST STATEMENT YOU MADE MAY SHED LIGHT ON THE REASON WHY TWO BILLION DOLLARS OF. REAR AGE- EFFORTS- WAS JUST NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE WE WEREN'T LOOKING AT JUST A SMALL POOL OF. CALIFORNIA RATEPAYERS RIGHT THERE'S A LONGER LIST OF FOLKS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT I'D LIKE TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS ASKED MISTER BAKER TO YOU. AS IT RELATES TO THE OTHER LEGACY PROGRAMS THAT WE SHOULD BE- TAKING A SERIOUS LOOK AT YOU MENTIONED CARES AND- AND SHIFTING IT TO THE GENERAL FUND VERSES- ON ON THE LIST OF HOW WE PAY FOR IT NOW. IF YOU CAN ELABORATE- STARTING WITH THAT AND GO DOWN THE LIST OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT YOU THINK. ARE DESERVING OF LEGISLATE CHUR OVERSIGHT- AND ME BE RESTRUCTURING AND THEN THE OTHERS JUST SOME COMMENTS ON THE C. P. C. AUDIT RELATED TO THE FIRE MITIGATION- A DOLLARS THAT SURE RIGHT TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON HIM. I WHAT WE'RE- WE'D BE TURN WOULD BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT CHANGING. THE CARE STRUCTURE. OF BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THEY'RE THE GUARANTEED REVENUE STREAM IF WE SEARCH. I REMEMBER THE YEARS MANY OF YOU REMEMBER. MANY DARK YEARS OF YEAR AFTER YEAR OF BUDGET DEFICIT AND IT WAS BRUTAL HERE. ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL I'M AT. EIGHT I DON'T WANT CARE TO BE PART OF THAT I WOULD RATHER CARE TO BE PROTECTED. BUT LET ME LET LET ME GET TO THE CORE. OF YOUR QUESTION- ADDRESSING THE- I'M SORRY THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION COULD. EVALUATE OKAY THE AUDIT THE AUDIT OKAY. SO WHAT V. THIRTY FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW WITH THE STATE AUDIT SHOWS HAPPENED IS THAT BETWEEN THE WHAT THE PHILIPPINES IS DOING AND WHAT THE OPETH OF ENERGY FIFTIES DOING. REPAIRS ON THE PUBLIC HAVE BEEN CUT OUT OF THE PROCESS. OF WITH AB TEN FIFTY FOUR EIGHT PAIRS LIKE TURN HAVE BEEN CUT OUT OF THE FIFTY CERTIFICATE- WE'RE NOT PART OF THAT PROCESS INTERVENOR COMPENSATION WITH A WAS ELIMINATED FROM THAT FROM THAT PROPOSAL- THERE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE. THE PROPER MITIGATION PLAN WITH OPPOSED TO- BE COVERED UNDER INTERVENOR COMPENSATION ANOTHER THREE PCS ST WHAT WE DON'T THINK SO WE DON'T THINK IT'S COVERED. THE CPSC. WHEN IT INVESTIGATED. THE CAUSE OF WILDFIRES UTILITY INVOLVEMENT IN WILDFIRES THEY USED TO INVESTIGATE IT AND THEN INVITE PARTY FLIGHT TURNED AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES ARE MULTI GRADE ROAD ALLIANCE FORINSTANCE I DEFEND THE A GO TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCEEDINGS IN THE NEGOTIATIONS WELL THIS YEAR FOR THE KINCAID FIRE FOR PG&amp;E AND THE THOMAS FIRE FOR THE CALIFORNIA EDISON IT WAS ALL DONE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS NO TRANSPARENCY. AND IT WAS A BACK ROOM DEAL TURN IS CRITICIZED THE PC ROUNDLY FOR THIS SO I THINK PART OF IT IS THAT IF YOU WANT MORE ACCOUNTABILITY YOU CAN'T KEEP GROUPS LIKE TURN YOU CAN'T KEEP OUR EXPERTS OUT OF THE ROOM I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU MAY WANT OF GROUPS TO BE IN THE ROOM SO THAT IT'S NOT SIMPLY THE UTILITY NEGOTIATING WITH THE REGULATOR. AND THAT FIT. THANK YOU I'M ELECT ELABORATE ON ANY OF THE OTHER LEGACY PROGRAMS YOU FOCUSED ON CARE WHEN YOU FELT LIKE IF YOU HELP ME OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE AT THE C. P. U. C. THAT HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTED IN THERE AB SIXTY SEVEN REPORT- LOOKING AT- HOW STATE. INTERVENES INVESTS SUBSIDIZES- WHATEVER TERMINOLOGY WE WANT TO USE- BUT IS THERE- SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AS WE'VE HONED IN ON MA'AM ARE THERE OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE THE NAME PROGRAM. WE ALL BE TAKING A LOOK AT IT IN IN GENERAL. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER SHOULD BE SHOULD RATEPAYER. BE PAYING FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS ON THEIR BILL SHOULD BE PAYING SHOULD THEY BE PAYING FOR THE CONVERSION OF LIGHT AND MEDIUM DUTY COMMERCIAL VEHICLES ON THEIR MONTHLY BILLS SHOULDN'T THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR BE BE PAYING FOR THAT- I THINK THERE'S A WHOLE LIST OF PROGRAMS THAT RATE PAYERS ARE PAYING FOR THAT WOULD BE BETTER PAID THROUGH OTHER PROGRAMS WE HAVE- SOCALGAS. REQUESTING MONEY FOR DOING RESEARCH ON A BIG HYDROGEN PROJECT AND THERE IS MONEY FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO DO THAT SO THERE ARE A LOT. A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS THAT WE AND I CAN PROVIDE YOU A MORE COMPREHENSIVE LIST- AFTER THE SHOOTING MAYBE A LIST LIKE THIS ONE- WOULD BE COULD AS A FOLLOW UP I REALLY TO WEIGH IN ON ON ON THE- REAL CORE OF- I WAS LOOKING AT ALL PROGRAMS AND NOT JUST. PICKING ON ONE I AGREE WITH YOU AND I APPRECIATE THAT APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THINKING BROADLY. THANK YOU I DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON MY LOOK TO MY LEFT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS. SEEN ON TO MY RIGHT AGAIN I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU VERY MUCH GARCIA WE'RE GONNA ASK- DIRECTOR- OF THE- RAIMEL DEFENSE FUND- MICHAEL COLEMAN TO PLEASE COME FORWARD. BEFORE WE START WITH THAT TESTIMONY WE'RE GOING TO RECESS. THE INFORMATION HEARING WE'RE GOING TO- CALL THE- MEETING TO ORDER AGAIN FOR THE UTILITIES AND ENERGY REGULAR MEETING AND ASKED THAT- THE SECRETARY CALL THE ROLL ON THE OPEN ITEMS ON THE AGENDA. ITEM NUMBER ONE AB NINETEEN SIXTY THE MOTION IS DUE PASS ITEM NUMBER TWO A. B. TWENTY THREE OH TO THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED AS AMENDED TO NATURAL RESOURCES. MAYES REYES SANTIAGO SANTIAGO AYE TANG THAT'S THE ELEVEN ZERO RIGHT WE WILL KEEP THAT ITEM OPEN FOR OTHER MEMBERS TO ADD ON WILL LAST THE SERGEANTS TO GIVE THEM A CALL- AND SO AT THIS TIME WE WILL NOW BEGIN RECESS AT THE UTILITIES ND ENERGY COMMITTEE AND RE OPENED THE PUBLIC- INFORMATION HEARING. OF THE COMMITTEE. DIRECTOR OPENER ROGERS. AT PENTATHLETE THANK YOU SO MUCH. GIVE ME ONE MOMENT TO GET MY TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER HERE THIS I THINK WE CAN I'M OFF THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO. ISN'T THIS AFTERNOON IT'S A REAL HONOR- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO START OFF TO SAY. WE ARE IN VERY UNUSUAL TIMES WHEN IT COMES TO INFLATION CUSTOMERS ARE SUFFERING WE KNOW THIS AND SO ANYTHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE CAN DO TO HELP WITH BILL RELIEF TO HELP CUSTOMERS FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS ENERGY TRANSITION IN A WAY THAT PRESERVES DIGNITY FOR THEM FOR THEIR LIVES FOR THEIR FAMILIES IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND I THINK THAT WAS GETTING MISS FROM PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT I WAS HEARING EARLIER TODAY SO I WANTED TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THAT WAS EMPHASIZED- MY GOAL HERE WAS NOT TO TALK ABOUT ANY ONE SPECIFIC BILL THAT'S CURRENTLY PENDING BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE. BUT TO OFFER UP SOME IDEAS OF THINGS THAT THIS COMMITTEE COULD DO EITHER THE SESSION ON THE FUTURE AND I STAND READY TO HELP. BRAINSTORM WITH ANY AND ALL OF YOU AS MUCH AS I CAN- THE FIRST QUESTION I'D LIKE TO OFFER UP IS YOU HAVE THIS BUT HEARING IS ABOUT RATES AND I THINK THAT'S APPROPRIATE. BUT I'D LIKE TO PUSH ON THAT QUESTION FOR A MOMENT WHY ARE WE FOCUSING ON RATES. AS SIMON BAKER SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS PRESENTATION RATES ARE THE HIGHEST IN THE COUNTRY FOR CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO HAS SOME OF THE HIGHEST ELECTRIC RATES ANYWHERE. BUT RATES IS ONE METRIC- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI TALKED ABOUT THE RATE SOURCES BILLS PART OF IT BUT I ACTUALLY THINK WE NEED TO GO A STEP FURTHER THAN THAT- AND I'M GOING TO SUGGEST SOME IDEAS DURING THIS PRESENTATION OF THE OF MAY BE A BETTER METRIC PRESS TO BE THINKING ABOUT- I DO WANT TO NOTE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE LEGISLATURE AS GIVEN US SOME DIRECTION. AS A STATE SAYING WE WANT TO DECARBONIZE THE ECONOMY AND WE WANT TO DO THAT ON. THE U. USING LEVERAGE OF THE STATE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM TO DO THAT SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A RATE VERSUS BILL INTACT WELL RATES ARE HIGH BUT USAGE IS LOWER BUT NOW WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT INCREASING USAGE. BUT THAT'S A SUBSTITUTE FOR SOMETHING ELSE SO WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT WELL WHAT IF THAT SUBSTITUTION EFFECT AND IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE US TO WHITE IN THAT LENDS A LITTLE BIT. AND SO RATES ARE GONNA GO OUT. THERE ARE WAYS TO CONTAIN THAT USAGE IS GOING TO GO UP THERE WAYS TO CONTAIN NINE BUT OTHER THINGS ARE GOING TO GO DOWN AND WE NEED TO BE THINKING THROUGH THAT. SO MY FIRST GO BOLDER STATEMENT THAT I GUESS I WOULD HAVE TO THIS COMMITTEE IS LET'S NOT FOCUS ON RATES AND LET'S NOT FOCUS ON RATES AND BILLS LET'S FOCUS ON CUSTOMERS AND HOW WE CAN HELP THEM WITH THEIR ENERGY BURDEN- ENERGY BURDEN ITSELF IS A TERM OF ART. THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TALKS ABOUT IT AS THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUR OVERALL INCOME THAT YOU SPEND ON YOUR TOTAL ENERGY BILL. AND I WOULD POSIT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THIS AS HOLISTICALLY AS WE CAN IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT. WHAT WE PLUG IN TO CHARGE YOUR IPHONE THAT ITS THE- THE GAS THAT GOES INTO OUR CAR IT'S ABOUT THE GAS IT'S USING TO POWER HOMES THE PROPANE TANKS ARE- EVERYTHING ELSE THE ENTIRE ENERGY BURDEN HOW MUCH MONEY ARE WE SPENDING THEIR- LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS ON AVERAGE SPEND THREE TIMES MORE. OF AN ENERGY BURDEN THAN OTHER CUSTOMERS TO. THAT'S A REALLY HIGH NUMBER WE NEED TO THINK THROUGH THAT. AND OF COURSE AND I ALSO JUST OBSERVE THAT. I HOPE IT WASN'T SOMETHING I SAID YOU KNOW WHAT. I ALSO OBSERVE JUST AS WE THINK ABOUT ENERGY BURDEN AS A METRIC THAT CALIFORNIANS HAS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND ONE THIRD OF OUR CITIZENS CANNOT AFFORD THEIR ENERGY BILL TODAY WE KNOW THAT AND SO WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE ADOPT THIS METRIC NOT JUST FOR CARE CUSTOMERS BUT HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT IT KIND OF. GOING FORWARD IF WE USE ENERGY BURDEN AS A METRIC WE COULD DESIGN THAT WE COULD THINK ABOUT IT. AS I THINK YOU MIGHT HEAR MISCAST AS TALK ABOUT IN THE NEXT PRESENTATION ALSO. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE AVERAGE CUSTOMER BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DIVIDE DESIGNED THIS TO BE FOR COHORTS OF CUSTOMERS. THE MOST VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS THEIR ENERGY BURDEN IS SO MUCH DIFFERENT THAN. MEDIAN INCOME HOUSEHOLD IN A WEALTHY HOUSE ON HOUSEHOLD INCOME EXCUSE ME. THAN A CUT SMALL BUSINESS EXCEPT OURS WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SEGMENT OUT ENERGY BURDEN. IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND WE TYPICALLY THINK ABOUT IT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CARE VERSUS NON CARE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT READ VERSUS NON RIGHTS IT'S REALLY. HOW DO WE DEFINE. THE QUADRANTS OF CUSTOMERS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE ENERGY BURDEN IS APPROPRIATE FOR EACH QUADRANT THAT'S OUT THERE. THAT'S DOABLE WE KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. BUT IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE SOME WORK AND IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE WANTS. TO THINK THROUGH YOU HAVE TO GIVE THAT DIRECTION- I WEIGHED A SAY AS PART OF THAT DIRECTION IT SHOULD BE THE OVERALL GUIDANCE THAT WE WANT ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU SAID IN TERMS OF INCOME TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO AN AFFORDABLE CLEAN AND SAFE RELIABLE ENERGY SYSTEM THAT SHOULD BE THE MANDATE- IN EACH OF THOSE ARE GOING TO HAVE TRADE OFFS ATTACHED TO IT I COULD BUILD YOU THE MOST AFFORDABLE SYSTEM IN THE WORLD. BUT THERE MIGHT BE A COUPLE OF BLACKOUTS AND MIGHT NOT BE THE BEST OUTCOME WHEN WE'RE ELECTRIFYING THE ECONOMY I COULD BUILD TO THE CLEANEST SYSTEM IN THE WORLD- THAT WOULD WE HAS RELIABILITY ISSUES UNLESS WE OVER INVEST IN CERTAIN WAYS THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE TRADE OFFS BETWEEN EACH OF THESE METRICS THAT I'M SORT OF THROWING OUT THERE BUT I THINK THE RIGHT BALANCE IS GOING TO BE BETWEEN HOW DO WE GET AFFORDABLE CLEAN SAFE RELIABLE SYSTEMS AND MAKE CERTAIN THAT. ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO IT. AND I DID WANT TO PIVOT FROM THAT INTO. SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING- A LITTLE BIT OF WHILE. RATES ARE TOO HIGH WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SLOW DOWN ON OUR CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENTS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO COMPENSATE. I THINK THAT'S THE WRONG APPROACH- I WANT TO UPLOAD SOMETHING THAT MARK TONY SAID OF HOW DO WE GET THE MOST GREEN FOR THE LEAST GREEN. AND I WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT TO GO THROUGH- SOME RECENT WORK THAT ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUNDED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CLEAN AIR TASK FORCE ON. CAN WE ACTUALLY CHIEF ARE SENATE BILL ONE HUNDRED OBJECTIVES CAN WE FULLY DECARBONISE THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM AND DO SO IN AN AFFORDABLE RELIABLE WAY. AND THE ANSWER IS YES TO SKIP DOWN TO THE PUNCH LINE WE CAN DO THAT BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO START MAKING DIFFERENT PROCUREMENT CHOICES AND DIFFERENT CHOICES ON TRANSMISSION AND LOOKING AT WHAT OUR LAND USE IS WHAT OUR PERMITTING PROCESS IS RUN AFTER THINK THROUGH THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE HOLISTICALLY. BUT WE CAN'T DO IT. AND TO ANSWER ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT I HEARD EARLIER THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO MISTER BAKER. AND THE COST OF RENEWABLES NOW IS SO INEXPENSIVE THAT A SYSTEM MODELERS GOING TO SAY WELL LET'S JUST ADD A TON OF THAT LET'S JUST GO ON AND ON SELECT THREE CENTS AND THAT'S THE RIGHT CALL FOR THE MOST PART. BUT JUST LIKE YOUR STOP BUT- PORTFOLIO YOU WANT TO HAVE A BALANCED DIVERSE PORTFOLIO DIVERSITY IS GOING TO ACTUALLY HELP CONTAIN COSTS HERE IN SO WHEN YOU HAVE A REPAIR ADVOCACY GROUP OR WHEN YOU HAVE AN ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP WHEN YOU HAVE ANYONE COMING IN TO YOU AND SAYING THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PROJECT AND IT'S SO CHEAP. WE NEED TO THINK WELL WHAT'S THE COST OF THIS INDIVIDUAL PROJECT AND WHAT'S THE TOTAL SYSTEM COST IF WE CAN THINK ABOUT THE TOTAL SYSTEM COSTS WE MIGHT BE BUYING A COUPLE OF- GENERATIONAL UNITS THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE OR WE MIGHT BE DOING SOME TRANSMISSION LINES THAT ARE NEW. BUT ARE GOING TO BE COST EFFETIVE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT FROM THE WHOLE SYSTEM AND SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A TRADE OFF THEIR OF IS THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE BUT WE'RE DEFERRING FIVE OF THE OTHER CHEAP THINGS AND IS THAT A GOOD INVESTMENT TO MAKE- I. A I APOLOGIZE. I WANTED TO MAKE CERTAIN TO HIGHLIGHT BECAUSE THEY DID REALLY TREMENDOUS WORK FOR US- THIS REPORT. THE LINK IS THERE IT WAS UNDER PINE WITH MODELING WORK FROM PRINCETON STANFORD AND P. THREE- WITH THE BASIC IDEA HERE THAT ONE MODEL GOOD THREE MODEL GETS. IS BETTER- AND REALLY WANT TO HIGHLIGHT HOW FANTASTIC THAT WORK AS- AND I'M NOT AT ALL BIASED BECAUSE MY NAME IS ALSO ON IT BUT- I DID WANT TO HIGHLIGHT HERE. AND AGAIN MY THINKING OF I DON'T THINK THAT WE SHOULD BE SLOWING DOWN. OUR CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENTS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT WE'RE KEEPING THE GREAT AFFORDABLE. AND I APOLOGIZE AT ON THE SCREEN OVER THERE IT IS CUT OFF A LITTLE BIT IT IS SHOWING UP RIGHT ON THE SLIDE SO I HOPE IT'S PRINTING OUT FOR YOU AS WELL OKAY BUT I WILL DO MY BEST TO TALK THROUGH THAT'S- ONE OF THE RESULTS HERE. IS THIS DOTTED LINE IS CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT THIS IS TWENTY TWENTY NUMBER SO IT'S CHANGED SLIGHTLY BUT- I CALIFORNIA'S MARLYS CURRENT. GENERATION AND TRANSMISSION RATE AT ABOUT NINE CENTS IN THE SUGGEST FOR THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. I THAT RATE IS GOING TO GO UP WE'RE GOING TO GO YEAH IT'S GOING TO GO UP A LITTLE BIT- MAY BE BY IF WE WERE TO SEE ON THE PATHWAY THAT WE'RE ON RIGHT NOW AND REALLY GO AFTER OUR FULL DECARBONIZATION GOALS AND THAT INCLUDES DOUBLING THE SIZE OF THE ELECTRIC GRADE TO ACCOUNT FOR ALL THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES FOR ALL THE NEW HOMES THAT ARE GONNA BE ELECTRIFIED FOR EVERYTHING. ELSE REALLY TRYING TO LECTURE FIVE THE ECONOMY AND FULLY ELIMINATE EMISSIONS FROM THAT WE CAN DO IT. IN A WAY BUT IF WE STAY ON THE SHORT DURATION BATTERY PLUS STOLAR ONLY MODEL IN SOLICITING THE CHEAPEST RENEWABLE THAT'S OUT THERE. WE'RE PROBABLY GONNA SEE A DOUBLING OF RATES ON THAT METRIC. BUT IF WE LOOK TO SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE BUT CAN HELP CONTAIN OVERALL SYSTEM COST AND WE'RE TURNING THIS A CLEAN FROM POWER APPROACH. THESE ARE ANY OF THE OPTIONS THAT ARE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE. WE CAN ACTUALLY DO ALL OF THAT WORK AND KEEP RATES MORE OR LESS WHERE THEY'RE AT TODAY. SO GIVING SOME GUIDANCE TO THE TO REGULATORS TO SAY. IT'S OKAY TO LOOK AT AN INDIVIDUAL POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT BUT IT'S ALSO OKAY TO LOOK AT THE TOTAL IMPACT ON SYSTEM COST. AND WHAT THE OVERALL BALANCE THERE'S GOING TO BE. I THINK THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE GUIDANCE IN METRIC THAT WE SHOULD DO- I DO WANNA UP WITH SOMETHING THAT I HEARD BOTH DR TONY AND MISTER BAKER SAY. DURING THEIR PRESENTATIONS. THE SINGLE LARGEST DRIVER OF RATES IS NOT GOING TO BE. NEW GENERATION OR NEW TRANSMISSION IT REALLY IS THE WILDFIRE COST AND SO IF WE ARE LOOKING AT WAYS TO CONTAIN COSTS IN TO GIVE CUSTOMERS AND BILL RELIEF. WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY AFTER THIS REALLY COMPLICATED GRAPH IS. DON'T LOOK TOWARDS THE CLEAN ENERGY AGENDA TO HELP SAVE COSTS THEIR WAYS OF KEEPING THESE COSTS JUST REASONABLE AFFORDABLE. LET'S LOOK AT THE THINGS THAT ARE REALLY MOVING THE NEEDLE ON THE BILL ITSELF. AND TO PICK THAT ONE MORE TIME I DID WANT TO ALSO SAY AS WE ARE THINKING ABOUT WHAT WHAT IS THE GUIDANCE OF THE LEGISLATURE ITSELF CAN DO TO HELP THINK THROUGH AFFORDABILITY I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK THROUGH WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL AND NON MONETARY BENEFITS AND THINGS THAT HAPPEN THAT CUSTOMERS INTERACT WITH ON THEIR ENERGY BILL BUT ALL THE BENEFITS ARE GOING TO BE CAPTURED IN THE RIGHT WAY. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS SLIDE I JUST WANTED TO TALK A MOMENT ABOUT VEHICLE ELECTRIFICATION OR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES MORE BROADLY. AND I REALLY WANT TO FOCUS ON MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES THESE ARE RELATIVELY SMALL BY NUMBER BUT A HUGE BANG FOR THE BUCK FOR REDUCING BOTH LOCAL AIR POLLUTION. THINGS THAT CAUSE ASTHMA AND OTHER HEALTH IMPACTS AND ALSO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. NOW IF WE WERE TO TAKE SORT OF A SCATTERSHOT APPROACH AND SAY SOMETHING LIKE FOR LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES- WE HAVE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE- IT'S REALLY EXPENSIVE AND YOU DON'T ACTUALLY GET TO CAPTURE THAT MANY OF THESE SORT OF EXTRA NON MONETARY BENEFITS RIGHT AWAY. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE TRUCKS AND BUSES THEMSELVES ARE OPERATING IN CONCENTRATING PRIORITIZE YOUR INVESTMENTS IN THOSE AREAS. AND WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE WE KNOW THE VEHICLES ARE REGISTERED WIN OVER THE PORTS ARE WIN OVER THE HIGHWAY CORRIDORS ARE. YOU END UP GETTING AN UP LIFT IT OF REALLY VULNERABLE POPULATIONS EACH OF THESE ARE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AS DEFINED BY COLIN VIRUS SCREEN AND YOU END UP GETTING FOR RELATIVELY MODEST REPAIR INVESTMENT. ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE HUGE BENEFITS ON HEALTH AND ON LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL OF OUTCOMES. IN SO THINKING THROUGH WHERE DO WE MAKE THE INVESTMENTS IN HAVING THE LEGISLATURE GETS SOME SORT OF SENSE OF PRIORITY. IS REALLY IMPORTANT HERE. IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW DO WE FREE UP ADDITIONAL INCOME FOR CUSTOMERS. WHILE GIVING SOME ADDITIONAL INCOME BY REDUCTION AND HEALTH IMPACTS IS A HUGE BENEFIT TO OUT BEDS OUT THERE. AND I KNOW THAT. WHEN IT COMES TO THESE GREAT UPGRADES THE PAST IS NOT GOING TO BE A PREDICTOR OF THE FUTURE WE REALLY DO NEED TO LOOK TO NEW SOURCES OF DATA. THAT'S POSSIBLE WE KNOW HOW TO DO THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO NEED TO GET SOME DIRECTION HERE. AND THIS IS MY LAST FLIGHT BECAUSE I REALLY DO WANT THIS TO BE MUCH MORE OF A DIALOGUE BUT I WANTED TO. OFFER UP A LITTLE BIT OF COMMENTARY- THIS WAS ALLUDED TO BY BOTH OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS SO I DON'T THINK THIS IS. A REVOLUTIONARY CONCEPT BUT WHO IS PAYING AND WHO SHOULD BE PAYING. WELL THERE'S CERTAIN CUSTOMER INVESTMENTS ARE GONNA BE CAPTURED ON BILL SON THAT THE CUSTOMER THEMSELVES ARE GOING TO BE PAYING FOR JUST. ON THEIR CREDIT CARD. OR ON SOME SORT OF PRIVATE FINANCE. THEIR TAXPAYER INVESTMENTS AND THEN THERE ARE SHAREHOLDER INVESTMENTS AND I pGUIDANCE ON. ALL FOR THESE- IF I CAN RESPOND TO SOMETHING. THAT THE FIRST TWO SPEAKERS SAID. I THINK IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE AGAIN TO BE LOOKING TOWARDS WILDFIRE MITIGATION COSTS AT SOMETHING THAT MAY BE TAXPAYERS SHOULD BE PICKING UP THE- BILL FOR. THAT IT IS VERY CLEARLY. A SOCIAL PROBLEM THAT ALL CUSTOMERS. REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU'RE LOCATED ARE BEING IMPACTED BY THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME FOR RATE RELIEF. AND THERE ARE OTHER INVESTMENTS WHERE MAYBE WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT WELL WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE ROLE FOR TAXPAYER AND RATEPAYER MONIES TO BE WORKING TOGETHER- I. HAVE SO MUCH RESPECT FOR DR TONY BUT I DISAGREE WITH HIM WITH HIS RECOMMENDATION ON BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION I ACTUALLY THINK WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE LEVERAGE RATEPAYER MONEY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. DIRECT INCENTIVES IS ONE APPROACH BUT CAN WE GET ADDITIONAL LEVERAGE FROM THOSE INVESTMENTS HAVE REVOLVING LOAN FUNDS HAVE BY DOWNS OF RATES OF LOANS DO OTHER THINGS TO HELP DO THIS. THE SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM THAT'S OUT THERE IS REALLY NO SENSE THAT HATING THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A MAJOR INVESTMENT. I ALSO NOTE THAT WE'RE GONNA WANT TO TARGET THOSE INVESTMENTS NOT JUST TO LOW INCOME POPULATIONS WHICH MAY HAVE TROUBLE PAYING FOR AN UPGRADE AT THE BEGINNING THAT WOULD BE A VERY. THAT WOULD BE A INVESTMENT IT MAKES LOT OF SENSE. BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE OVERALL ENERGY BURDEN. IT SHOULD BE HOW DO WE HELP LOWER INCOME CUSTOMERS AND ALSO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE REMAINING GAS CUSTOMERS WHO AREN'T MAKING THOSE ELECTRIFICATION INVESTMENTS DON'T HAVE THEIR BILLS SKYROCKET BECAUSE AGAIN IT'S OVERALL ENERGY BURDEN THAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT HERE. SO IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN TARGET THE INVESTMENT SO THAT WE CAN RETIRE SOME GAS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE CANTAKES AT LEAST EXPENSIVE COSTS OUT OF RATES- THERE'S SOME OTHER COMMENTARY THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS AS WELL ON SOME OF HE OTHER LEGACY PROGRAMS THAT I KNOW CHAIR GARCIA WAS ASKING ABOUT I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS THOSE IF THE COMMITTEE WANTS BUT I THINK- FOR EACH OF THESE ITEMS I THINK THERE IS A ROLE FOR ALL FOUR SETS OF WALLETS TO BE PAYING- AND WHAT'S APPROPRIATE THE LAST NOTE THAT I WANT TO MAKE HERE- WHEN IT COMES TO LEGACY COST IN LEGACY PROGRAMS. THE SCALE OF INVESTMENT THAT HAS TO OCCUR INCALIFORNIA. IS GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT. AND SOME OF THAT IS GOING TO BE DONE THROUGH THE UTILITY PROGRAMS AND SOME OF THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE IN OTHER WAYS BUT IF WE- ARE GOING TO BE MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS IN MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS AS CHEAPLY AS WE CAN WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM RISKY. LESS RISKY EXCUSE ME WE DON'T WANT TO INCREASE RISK WE WANT TO DECREASE STRESS WE WANT TO MAKE THEM AS CHEAP AS POSSIBLE FROM A RISK PERSPECTIVE. PREDICTABILITY AND SECURITISATION ARE GREAT TOOLS THAT THE LEGISLATURE KNOWS HOW TO DO. ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO LOWER THE COST OF CAPITAL THAT WE CAN DO TO LOWER THE BORROWING COSTS ARE GREAT. IN SAID THAT MAY MEAN WE HAVE TO HONOR THE PROMISES OF THE PAST IN ORDER TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE FUTURE INVESTMENTS ARE AS CHEAP AS POSSIBLE. SO SECURITIZE ING IN TAKING OUT OF RATE BASE IS ONE OPTION OR SAYING LOOK IT WOULD BE GREAT TED TAKE SOMETHING OUT OF RATE BASE AND TO SAY SHAREHOLDERS HAVE TO EAT THAT COST. BUT IT MIGHT BE PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISH TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA LOOK LIKE A VERY RISKY PLACE TO DO BUSINESS IN FUTURE INVESTMENTS FOR DEVELOPERS ARE GOING TO GO UP THE COMPANY OF FAR MORE. SO THERE IS A BALANCE THERE SO AS THE LEGISLATURE'S THINKING THROUGH WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP CONTAIN OVERALL AFFORDABILITY. I WOULD ENCOURAGE TO THINK THROUGH WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP REDUCE RISK FROM SHAREHOLDER INVESTMENTS WHETHER THEY BE UTILITY SHAREHOLDER OR THIRD PARTY SHAREHOLDER INVESTMENTS. ON WITH THAT I THINK THAT'S THE END OF MY PREPARED PRESENTATION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MISTER COLVIN BEFORE WE- PROCEED- WE'D LIKE TO. TAKE CARE OF OUR OUR OUR OUR OUR BUSINESS HERE- IN IN IN REGARDS TO THE BILLS THAT WERE ON THE AGENDA. AND SO LET ME READ MY SKIPPED MY SCRIPT HERE WE ARE NOW GOING TO RECESS OUR REGULAR HEARING TO ALLOW TIME FOR VOTERS ADD ONS- OKAY THE THAT THE RIGHT PARTY SCRIPT. I KNOW THAT WAS AROUND OKAY WHO WE WILL TEMPORALLY RECESS ARE INFORMATIONAL HEARING AND CONVENE OUR REGULAR HEARING TO ALLOW MEMBERS TO VOTE. YES MA'AM CENTER. ITEM NUMBER ONE AB NINETEEN SIXTY THE MOTION IS DUE PASS ITEM NUMBER TWO THE MOTION AS DO PASSES AMENDED TO NATURAL RESOURCES. MAYES REYES REYES I TÍNH. THAT'S TWELVE ZERO. THAT THAT WAS OUT. ALL RIGHT TWELVE ZERO THANK YOU FOR BILLS ARE OUT OKAY I WILL NOW ADJOURN OUR REGULAR BILL HEARING AND PROCEED WITH OUR INFORMATION HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER COLVIN- QUESTIONS FOR- MISTER COLVIN FROM THE COMMITTEE. MS RENTS COLEMAN I PREPARED PAUL DIES IF ASK THIS QUESTION OF BUT- I'LL DO MY BEST ALL RIGHT IN THE COMMITTEE BACKGROUND PAPER THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS THAT WAS LISTED. OF FOR A REDUCING THESE COSTS WAS TO LIMIT THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES RETURN ON EQUITY. AS A WAY TO LIMIT THE COST OF RATES. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT OF COURSE- AND. THE SUIT SO I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE OF OPTIONS THAT ARE REALLY INTERESTING WITH AND THAT'S THE FIRST ONE IS. I RIGHT NOW A COMBINED FUEL UTILITY LIKE SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC. THEY EARN THE SAME AMOUNT OF RETURN. FOR EVERY CAPITAL INVESTMENT REGARDLESS OF ITS TYPE IF THEY MAKE AN INVESTMENT ON A GAS PIPE OR ON A TRANSMISSION WIRE. IT'S THE SAME AMOUNT OF RETURN THAT'S PROBABLY THE WRONG OUTCOME IF WE ARE LOOKING TOWARDS DECARBONIZING THE ECONOMY ON A MAJOR LEVERAGE OF CLEAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE WE MIGHT NOT WANT TO BE GIVING SHAREHOLDERS THE SAME RETURN ON LEGACY GAS INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S IN THE GROUND VERSES NEW GAS PIPELINE INVESTMENTS VERSUS NEW ELECTRIC INVESTMENTS. INTO ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT EDF HAS ADVOCATED FOR ON AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION AND FOR PROCEDURAL REASONS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO RE ASK FOR IT AGAIN NEXT MONTH IN THEIR NEW COST TO CAPITAL PROCEEDING BUT THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE IS TO BIFURCATE HOW SHAREHOLDERS RECEIVE THAT SIGNAL TO SAY LEGACY GAS INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT GET ONE REWARD. AND LEGACY INFRASTRUCTURE AND ELECTRIC MIGHT GET ANOTHER- AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT HERE UP IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA SACRAMENTO CUSTOMERS ARE. SERVED BY PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC FOR THEIR GAS SERVICE SINCE NOT FOR THEIR ELECTRIC SERVICE SAYS YOU'RE WELL AWARE- THE UTILITIES WHEN THEY SAY HERE'S OUR TOP RISKS HERE'S THE TOP AREAS OF WHY CALIFORNIA DESERVES A PREMIUM I DON'T THINK ACTUALLY DESERVE A PREMIUM BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY. THEY ONLY SITE ELECTRIC RISKS IN SO WHY SHOULD GAS ONLY CUSTOMERS THAT ARE HERE IN THIS AREA. HEY FOR A RATE ICREASE WHEN IT'S TO COMPENSATE FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE NOT EVEN RECEIVING THE SERVICE FOR. IN SO WE SHOULD THINK THROUGH WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE ON GAS VERSUS ELECTRIC AND HOW DO WE REWARD SHAREHOLDERS THE OTHER PART OF THAT ANSWER IN MY OPINION IS IF WE WERE TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WE WE'D BE ABLE TO GIVE SHAREHOLDERS A SIGNAL TO SAY HERE'S WHAT YOUR NEXT DOLLARS GOING TO GO AND HERE'S HOW IT'S GOING TO ALIGN WITH THE CUSTOMER INTEREST WITH ENVIRONMENTAL INTEREST. IN SO I THINK ONE OF THE PIECES OF GUIDANCE I COULD BE OUT THERE IS TO SAY. LET'S HAVE RETURN ON EQUITY ACTUALLY REWARD THE RISK FOR THE APPROPRIATE LINE OF BUSINESS NOT THE OVERALL COMPANY STRUCTURE. THIS IS A CONTROVERSIAL PROPOSAL THAT HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY THE COMMISSION YET THAT IT'S ONE WAY. THAT IS CERTAINLY WITHIN THE COMMISSION'S EXISTING AUTHORITY AT THE LEGISLATURE COULD GIVE THEM A KNOWLEDGE AND HELP POINT TOWARD SAYS. THAT WAY TO. REDUCE COSTS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION. THANK YOU ARE ANY OTHER MEMBERS. OKAY ALL RIGHT MISTER COLVIN I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS- SELF- FIRST OF ALL A THE COMMITTEE PROVIDED TO- INDICATES. THAT- SERVICE CENTER- V. ARRIGO. THE CROSS ALL ALL THREE I'LL USE RATES HAVE INCREASED SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN THE GROWTH AND RATES CAN- CAN BE LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO INCREASES FROM FROM- INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND INSIGHTS- IF YOU SEE FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE STUDY- WITH- IDENTIFYING TRANSMISSION BY PG&amp;E AND DISTRIBUTION BY S. C. E. N. S. T. G. N. E. R. WOULD YOU CONCUR WITH THAT- AND I BELIEVE THAT'S I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THAT'S WHAT THE REPORT SAYS I THINK THERE IS A LITTLE BIT OF NEW WANTS HAPPENING WITHIN THOSE NUMBERS THE LARGEST DRIVER FROM MY READ OF THOSE REPORTS AND LOOKING AT THE UNDERLYING SPREADSHEETS REALLY IS THE WILDFIRE COST THIS IS WHERE THEY GET RECORDED- IT'S SORT OF. A DIFFERENT BY EACH UTILITY. AND THE OTHER OBSERVATION THAT I WOULD MAKE. WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THIS IS. WE ARE GOING TO BUILD OUT. OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE NEED TO DO THAT NOW IN ORDER TO LET THE ELECTRIC USAGE ITSELF GO UP THAT WE'RE GOING TO IF WE'RE GOING TO BE ELECTRIFYING EVERY SINGLE VEHICLE IN THE STATE WHICH IS WHERE THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER AS- THERE'S GOING TO NEED TO BE NEW INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD OUT TO THE CAR TOWED TO TIE IT. TO HAPPEN. THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF THAT CAN BE DONE USING OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. ON FEDERATED SIGN YOU MENTION DURING ONE OF THE- EARLIER QUESTIONS SHOULD THERE BE MORE THINKING ABOUT RATE REFORM. MY ANSWER TO THAT IS AN EMPHATIC YES I THINK THERE REALLY IS A LOT THAT CAN BE DONE TO SEND SIGNALS TO CUSTOMERS OF. HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO TO USE YOUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT USE MORE OF THAT AND IF YOU SAT MORE SALES OVER THE EXACT SAME AMOUNT OF FIXED COSTS THE OVERALL BILL WILL BE BETTER AND AGAIN AS YOU THINK ABOUT. WHAT THE ENERGY. BURDEN IS ON CUSTOMERS THE MORE THAT WE CAN DO THAT SUBSTITUTION EFFECT AND LEVERAGE THE EXISTING PLATFORM. THE MORE WE'RE ABLE TO YOU KNOW BASICALLY SAY LUCK.-FIXED INFRASTRUCTURES THOSE COSTS ARE THE SAME NO MATTER WHAT WE'RE USING IT MORE THE PER UNIT COST IS GOING DOWN. THAT'S MORE SAVINGS FOR CUSTOMERS SO I'M NOT AS BOTHERED- BY SOME OF THOSE NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY DID THE OTHER NON WILD CARD NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY ARE SENDING OUT THAT ELECTRIFICATION PLUSH- WHAT I WANT TO ENSURE. IS THAT ALL CUSTOMERS HAVE ACCESS TO THAT ENERGY TRANSITION. IN THAT THE CUSTOMERS WHO AREN'T ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT STRAIGHT AWAY. ARE NOT LEFT WITH SKYROCKETING COSTS. MMHM SO- BUT GOING BACK TO MY- ORIGINAL QUESTION **** SO YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING IT'S A WHAT IS IT A DEFINITIONAL OR OR OR OR ACCOUNTING GOOD DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WELL WHETHER IT'S CLASSIFIED AS A- AS A- INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS OF OVER SUCH A SO THE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS OF WHETHER IT'S ON TRANSMISSION OR DISTRIBUTION I THINK IT IT'S MORE JUST THE NATURE OF THE SERVICE TERRITORY ITSELF WHERE PG&amp;E HAS TO DO MOST OF ITS WORK FOR WHILE PRIME MEDICATION. IS ON THE TRANSMISSION SIDE OF THINGS SO IT'S BEING RECORDED ON THE TRANSMISSION LINE OKAY WHERE EDISON HAS TO DO THEIR WORK I BELIEVE AS A FRONT THE BEST IN MY REVIEW OF THE WILDFIRE MITIGATION PLANS WITH MORE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SIDE SO IT'S JUST WHICH LINE IT GETS WRITTEN DOWN HONOR BUT THE MOTIVATORS THE SAME EITHER WAY YEAH. BUT- I'M AT BUT I THINK THAT'S A- I MEAN IN MY MIND IS THAT THE SAME SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE- IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THE PROBLEM BEING TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS- I KNOW IT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU KNOW WE NEED TO. THE THAT I IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM FOR SO MANY YEARS IT SEEMS LIKE YOU KNOW YOU'RE CHARACTERIZING YOU YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING THAT THAT IT'S ACTUALLY THE EVER GROWING WILDFIRE- CRISIS THAT THAT IS ACTUALLY DRIVING THE AND THAT THE COST NOT SHOULD. NOT LIKE SAY FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE NEED TO BUILD MORE TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE NEW CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS I MEAN IT'S NOT JUST ME SAYING THAT THAT'S WHAT THE PC REPORT THEMSELVES SAY NOT CUT THIS BAKER SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING OF- I. THERE IS I DON'T WANT TO MINCE WORDS SAID THERE IS NEW INVESTMENT THAT IS HAPPENING THAT IS SIGNIFICANT ON DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES ON TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION ON ON EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS MISTER TONY SPOKE SYDNEY DR COUNTY SPOKE TO SOME OF THESE AS WELL- AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE MY OPINION IS THAT. WE GO AFTER THE BIGGEST ITEM FIRST AND THE BIGGEST ITEM IS IN MY OPINION THE WILDFIRE COSTS AND THAT IT'S GOING TO SHOW UP IN DIFFERENT PLACES OF THE BILL. BUT THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK FOR A ONE TIME INVESTMENT FOR TAXPAYER MONEY IT MORE SOMETHING ELSE TO COME IN TO PUT INTO THE PICTURE MMHM. SO GOING BACK TO. DOCTOR TONY SO- ONE OF HIS MAIN POINTS ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW THE- SOME OF THESE COSTS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THE- THIS ESSAY THE GENERAL FUND INSTEAD OF GOING TO RATE PAYERS. ME WHICH WOULD BE- A BETTER CANDIDATE FOR- YOU KNOW. FOR GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. TO ADDRESS- WILDFIRE MITIGATION OR TRANSMISSION INDUSTRY COST. SO AGAIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER I THINK THOSE ARE THE SAME THE SAME THING THAT IT'S THE WILDFIRE COST IN WHICH LINED UP TO GO IN YOU ON THE MIDDLE. IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. MY BUT I THINK THE CORE OF YOUR QUESTION IS WHERE DO WE GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK IF WE WANT TO DO A ONE TIME INVESTMENT. AND I THINK THAT'S THE WILDFIRE- THE WILDFIRE RELIEF BOTH- THE INSURANCE COST AND THE MITIGATION COSTS. AND ONLY DO I THINK IT'S THE APPROPRIATE. AND JUST FROM A AN AFFORDABILITY PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE JUST FROM SORT OF A FAIRNESS PERSPECTIVE- WE ARE ALL PART OF. THE SAME STATE WERE ALL PART OF AN EVER CHANGING CLIMATE. IT'S NOT NECESSARILY CLEAR TO ME THAT- BECAUSE I LIVE IN A MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT I DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR A LOT. OF THE SAME WAY THAT IF I LIVE ONE TAP KERN LIVES IN AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES SERVICE TERRITORY. YEP THIS IS A STATE WIDE PROBLEM AND I THINK IT REQUIRES A STATEWIDE SOLUTION- AND I THINK IT'S VERY PER PURCHASE FROM EQUITY IN FAIR PERSPECTIVE. TO LOOK TOWARDS THE TAX DOLLARS FOR THAT'S THAT TYPE OF INVESTMENT MMHM YEAH THAT THAT'S- OKAY REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE WITH THAT BUT I THINK PUTTING IT ON THE BACKS OF INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES- CUSTOMERS IS PROBABLY THE WRONG OUTCOME. NOW RIGHT- I YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT. CLARIFICATION AND- HELPING WITH MY THINKING I GUESS WHEN I WAS TALKING ABOUT. TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS MEDIC. I KNOW THAT- THERE'S BEEN THERE THERE IS A LOT OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT TO. ABOUT BUILDING OUT MORE OFFSHORE WIND CAPACITY INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA AND THE POINT WAS OFTEN MADE THAT- THAT WE NEED TO EXPAND OUR TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION. INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE NEW- OFFSHORE WIND GENERATION- I THINK THE ANSWER IS YS WE WILL NEED TO DO THAT- AND AGAIN THE IF I POINT YOU BACK TO THE SLIDE THAT I SHOWED YOU SORT OF A FEW MINUTES AGO- IF YOU MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE OF PROCUREMENT POWER- IF YOU DO THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF LOOKING A TOTAL SYSTEM COSTS AS A WAY OF CONTAINING. OVERALL SYSTEM COSTS ABOUT THE GENERATION AND TRANSMISSION PERSPECTIVE. IN KEEPING IT MORE OR LESS WHERE RATES ARE AT TODAY EVEN IF WE DO A MAJOR EXPANSION OF THE GRANTED TO ACCOMMODATE ALL THE NEW ELECTRIFICATION PARTS OF THE SYSTEM SO WILL WE NEED TO INVEST ACTUAL DOLLARS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN YES BUT WE'RE ALSO GOING TO INCREASE OUR USAGE AND SO THE OVERALL BALANCE I THINK WILL WILL COME OUT. AND THERE'S WAYS OF DOING THAT VERY COST EFFECTIVELY ON EDS SUPPORTED THAT OFFSHORE WIND LEGISLATION LAST SESSION AND WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT I NEED TO DO A LOT MORE NEW TRANSMISSION BUILD OUT. BECAUSE WE NEED TO GET THE POWER WHERE IT'S NEEDED WHEN IT'S NEEDED IN ORDER FOR CUSTOMERS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. THERE ARE WAYS OF MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS THAT ARE HIGHLY COST EFFECTIVE- AND AS YOU OPEN THOSE OPPORTUNITIES- MORE CUSTOMERS GOING TO BE ABLE TO ELECTRIFY AND IT WILL COME OUT RHETT RELATIVELY WELL THAT BALLOTS WILL BE THERE. I DO NOTE. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A PERFECTLY TIMED MAJOR TRANSMISSION PROJECT IT'S EITHER GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT TOO EARLY OR A LITTLE BIT TOO LATE- IT'S REALLY HARD TO BUILD THINGS IN CALIFORNIA THE LAST MAJOR TRANSMISSION LINE TOOK SOMETHING LIKE NINE YEARS FROM START TO FINISH. AND BUT EVEN IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK WHAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO RIGHT NOW IS TO SAY. LET'S FIGURE OUT WAYS OF HELPING TO BUY DOWN THE COST OF SOME OF THOSE INVESTMENTS NOT DEFERRED THE INVESTMENT. IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO TO HELP EXPEDITE THE PROCESS HELP DE RISK IF EITHER- AS I TALKED ABOUT. A FEW MOMENTS AGO WITH- ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA IF HER WAYS OF BUYING DOWN THE SHAREHOLDER RESCUE AS A MUCH MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF BUYING DOWN THE INVESTMENT. THAT IS STILL BUT YOU GET THE PROJECT YOU WANT ONLINE AND ON TIME. IT ACTUALLY GIVES YOU MORE AFFORDABILITY THAN JUST SKIPPING THE PROJECT OUT RIGHT. I THINK THE BIGGEST MESSAGE THAT I WOULD GIVE TO YOU OUT OF MY REMARKS THE TODAY IS DON'T SLOW DOWN. YOUR CLEAN ENERGY AGENDA UNDER THE NAME OF AFFORDABILITY MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES. ABOUT MY LAST QUESTION IS- GUY ON THE AGAIN ON THE ISSUE OF. GENERAL FUND VERSES RATEPAYER DOLLARS. IN TERMS OF THE TRANSMISSION- INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD OUT NECESSARY TO SUPPORT NEW OFFSHORE WIND. IS IT IS IT IS IT BETTER TO PUT IT ON RATEPAYERS OR IS IT IS THAT A POSSIBLE CANDIDATE FOR GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. MY I WOULD WANT TO THINK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE MY PRELIMINARY. INITIAL REACTIONS HAVING RIGHT YOUR LIFE WHICH IS ALWAYS SCARY TOGETHER BUT I'M GONNA DO IT ANYWAYS IS I THINK THERE IS A ROLE FOR THE TAXPAYER DOLLAR TO HELP BUY DOWN THE COST. TO MAKE IT SO THAT IT IS A MORE SECURITIZED INVESTMENTS. BUT THAT THE OVERALL KIND OF CORE PART OF THE COST IS PROBABLY STILL APPROPRIATE TO BE ASSIGNED TO RATE PAYERS. SO I THINK IT IS A MATTER OF HOW DO WE LEVERAGE OUR TAXPAYER MONEY TO HELP BY DOWN OUR GRANDSON AND SENATE INTO THE SITUATION BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THE TAXPAYERS SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A 100% OF THOSE COSTS. AND THAT'S MY INITIAL THOUGHT AYE AYE IT WILL COME BACK TO YOU IF I HAVE A DIFFERENT THOUGHT IT TOO IN THE MORNING WHEN I WAS LIKE OH THIS IS HOW WE SHOULD ADVANCEMENT INSTEAD ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU- GREAT QUESTIONS AND I JUST WANTED TO DROP IT FROM THE COMMENTS ON TRANSMISSION AFFORDABILITY THE PDF ALSO PARTICIPATED IN THE ANALYSIS. THAT WAS- IDENTIFYING CITING PERMITTING COST- AND ALL OF THOSE CHALLENGES THAT COME WITH THAT I'M HOPING THAT- EVERY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN ABLE TO SEE THAT- INFORMATION- TRYING TO REMEMBER THE GROUP FOR THE COALITION THAT. PUT IT TOGETHER IF YOU WANT WAS HAVING A HEART- DONE WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE FUND IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CLEANER CAST THANK YOU YEAH THANK YOU I THINK THAT THAT IS TELLING- TO THE DISCUSSION THAT THE THAT THIS COMMITTEE NEEDS ALSO ENGAGE IN. AS IT RELATES TO THIS MISSION. AND THE ACCESS TO COST AND AFFORDABILITY THAT WE JUST HAD AN EXTENSIVE THOUGHT AMOUNT OF. HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR YOU BUT WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND- I DON'T SEE ANYONE ELSE RAISING THEIR HAND AT IT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. TO JEFF THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME I TRIED TO OFFER UP A FEW IDEAS TODAY AND I STAND READY TO HELP WORK WITH ANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IF YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT- EXPLOIT THESE IDEAS FURTHER BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU GONNA ASK- NOW THAT- THE DIRECTOR- OF THE CENTER FOR ACCESSIBLE TECHNOLOGY- BEAR FOR HER REMARKS SHE'S GOING TO BE DOING SO- VIA THE- INTERNET AND SO WE WELCOME HER MELISSA CABINETS IF YOU- WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN. WELCOME YEAH I THINK IT'S THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU WHO STEP AROUND TO THE END OF THIS UP CATTLE WHICH I FOUND VERY INTERESTING OKAY EVERYONE ELSE HAS AS WELL- I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY TELLING YOU ABOUT THE CENTER FOR ACCESSIBLE TECHNOLOGY. AND THE CONSTITUENCY THAT WE REPRESENT. SEE VERY T A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION. DEDICATED TO SUPPORTING THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF TECHNOLOGY. OUR ORGANIZATION PROVIDES DIRECT SERVICES AND WORKS ON BUILDING COMMUNITY CAPACITY TO SUPPORT ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY USERS AND DINNER LET'S SEE WORK WE APPETITE EXTENSIVELY BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION BECAUSE ACCESS TO RELIABLE AND AFFORDABLE UTILITY SERVICE AND PARTICULARLY ENERGY SERVICE. IS CRUCIAL TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR ABILITY TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY. THIS GROUP OF CUSTOMERS CUSTOMERS WITH DISABILITIES MEDICAL NEEDS AND VULNERABILITIES MANY OF WHOM MAY NOT EVEN SELF IDENTIFY THAT WAY. THAT I WANT TO FOCUS YOUR ATTENTION ON IN THESE LAST FEW MINUTES THIS AFTERNOON. THESE CUSTOMERS RELY ON ELECTRICITY. TO POWER ASSISTIVE DEVICES SOME OF WHICH ARE DIRECTLY OBVIOUSLY MEDICAL IN NATURE LIKE CHARGING POWER WHEELCHAIRS ARE POWERED RESPIRATORS. SOME ARE LESS OBVIOUS BUT EQUALLY VITAL THE PERSON WITH DIABETES WHO RELIES ON INSULIN. NEEDS THE REFRIGERATOR FUNCTION FOR THEIR INSULIN TO STAY POTENT AND IF THEY LOSE ACCESS TO POWER FOR THE REFRIGERATOR NOT ONLY WILL THEY SUFFER HEALTH IMPACTS BUT ALSO COSTS IF THEY LOSE ACCESS TO THEIR MEDICATION. PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TEND TO USE HIGH LEVELS OF ELECTRICITY. ARE ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW INCOME. THIS MEANS THAT INCREASING ELECTRICITY RATES PUTS AN EXTRA BURDEN ON THIS CONSTITUENCY. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT AVERAGE COSTS IT'S EASY TO LOSE SIGHT OF CUSTOMERS LIKE THIS WHO ARE AT THE EXTREMES BOTH IN TERMS OF THEIR USE. THEIR INCOME AND THEIR ABILITY TO ADAPT THEIR ABILITY TO INSTALL WHO TOP SOLAR OR TO PURCHASE AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE IS PROBABLY LOWER THAN AVERAGE AND THERE'S A RISK THAT THEY'LL BE LEFT BEHIND AS A LET'S SEE MAKERS DEVELOP INCENTIVES TO MOVE TOWARDS CLEANER ELECTRICITY. UNLESS THERE'S A LOT OF CARE GIVEN TO HOW TO ASSIST THOSE WHO MIGHT BE LEFT BEHIND. UNDER SOME PROGRAMS THAT ARE TARGETED SPECIFICALLY TOWARDS THIS POPULATION INCLUDING THE MEDICAL BASELINE PROGRAM. UNFORTUNATELY THIS PROGRAM ISN'T WELL KNOWN AND IT'S UNDER UTILIZED. BEEN RECENT EFFORTS TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT WHICH ARE WELCOME- BUT NOT SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE CUSTOMERS. SIMILARLY THERE'S TALK ABOUT USING RATES AND RATE DESIGN TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR. I THINK THIS IS A CRUCIAL PIECE OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW. BUT AGAIN NOT EVERY CUSTOMER IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO RATE SIGNALS THAT ARE SENT AND SO CARE NEEDS TO BE TAKEN TO PROTECT THOSE WHO MIGHT NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO SHIFT THE TIME THAT THEY CHARGE THEIR POWER WHEELCHAIR SO THAT IT'S OUTSIDE OF PEAK HOURS OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS THAT MIGHT. BE WHAT A POLICYMAKERS WANT TO ENCOURAGE BUT MAY NOT WORK FOR INDIVIDUAL USERS. THE NEED FOR ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE ENERGY IS A CRUCIAL MATTER OF HEALTH AND SAFETY PARTICULARLY FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS. IN MY CONSTITUENCY DRIVES THIS POINT HOME. SOME EXAMPLES. WELL BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE CALL THE PANDEMIC MY ORGANIZATION BURKE REGULAR CONCERNS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO LINGERED UNCOMFORTABLE AND EVEN UNSAFE TEMPERATURES IN OUR HOMES BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T AFFORD THE COSTS OF HEATING OR COOLING. MOST ACCORDING. WHAT PEOPLE FORCED TO SPEND MORE TIME AT HOME BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. AND UNABLE TO LOOK UP MOVE TO PUBLIC PLACES WITH AIR CONDITIONING DURING TIMES OF EXTREME HEAT. THIS HAS BEEN AN INCREASED RISK AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS IS PARTICULARLY PROBLEMATIC FOR PEOPLE WITH HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT REQUIRE THEM TO MAINTAIN A NARROW RANGE OF TEMPERATURES. SIMILARLY WELL BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE COPA PANDEMIC. MY ORGANIZATION HEARD REGULAR CONCERNS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVE TO SACRIFICE OTHER NECESSITIES SO THAT THEY COULD PAY THEIR POWER BILLS. YOU CAN GO WITHOUT MEDICAL CARE THEY DON'T FILL THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS THEY DON'T USE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES EVEN GO WITHOUT FOOD TO KEEP THEIR POWER. THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE FEDERAL HOUSING SUBSIDIES IF THEIR POWER IS TURNED OFF FOR NON PAYMENT THEIR FIRST HAVING THEIR KIDS TAKE IT AWAY. CUSTOMERS WHO ARE AT RISK MAKE TERRIBLE CHOICES TO KEEP THE POWER BOX. WITH COATED IN PEOPLE BEING FORCED TO SPEND MORE TIME AT HOME THESE PRE EXISTING CONCERNS SEVEN BEEN ACTIVATED. PEOPLE WITH MEDICAL LONGER ABILITIES ARE ARE ALSO AT INCREASED DIRECT RISKS DURING THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE THEY'RE THE MOST LIKELY TO HAVE- HAVE THE WORST OUTCOMES IF THEY IN FACT GET SICK. FOR THESE POPULATIONS THE ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN WORK AND SCHOOL TELL HEALTH AND SOCIAL ACTIVITIES ALL VIRTUALLY CONTINUES TO BE VITAL. AND NOW AS THE STATE IS MOVING AWAY FROM SOME BROAD PUBLIC HEALTH EFFORTS AND TOWARDS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY TO MEDICATE COVERT PRESS THE COSTS OF REMAINING AT HOME INCLUDING INCREASED ENERGY USE. CONTINUE TO BE A CONCERN FOR THE CUSTOMERS WHO FACE THESE CHOICES ALSO A KEY CONCERN FOR PEOPLE WHO DEPEND ON POWER FOR THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY. YOU TELL IT IS RELIANCE ON FIVE G. IN CREATION AND POWER SHUT OFFS AS PART OF A WILDFIRE MITIGATION STRATEGY. INCREASES THE RISK OF HARM TO THESE POPULATIONS. SO THESE ARE THE CUSTOMERS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THESE LAST FEW MINUTES. IN THE BOOK THAT THE BACKGROUND PAPER PRESENTED TODAY- MAKES CLEAR THAT CUSTOMERS ARE EXPERIENCING BILL INCREASES EVEN IF THEIR ENERGY USAGE ISN'T NECESSARILY CHANGING REASONS TO MOVE AWAY FROM VOLUMETRIC BILLS- AND MOVE TOWARDS THINGS LIKE EXTRACTIONS- THE RISKS TO THESE CUSTOMERS EVEN GREATER. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T REDUCE THOSE PORTIONS OF THEIR BILL FOR CONSERVATION. FOR CUSTOMERS WHOSE USAGE IS LOW CHANGES IN RATE STRUCTURE RISK INCREASES IN WHAT THEY HAVE TO PAY WITHOUT ANY CORRESPONDING BENEFITS. SO WHAT CAN THE LEGISLATURE DO UP WITH V. UP INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE THAT I REPRESENT IN MIND. THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IS CHARGED WITH ENSURING THAT ELECTRICITY RATES ARE JUST AND REASONABLE. AND THE LEGISLATURE CAN BE A PARTNER IN WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT MY CONSTITUENCIES NEEDS ARE PART OF THAT EQUATION. THE LEGISLATURE CAN MAKE CLEAR THAT CONSIDERATION OF AFFORDABILITY BILL FORD ABILITY IS PART OF THE CONSIDERATION OF WHETHER RATES ARE JUST AND REASONABLE. THAT MAY SEEM COMMONSENSE BUT IT'S NOT PART OF THE COMMISSION'S EQUATION AT THIS TIME. BUT MAKING THAT CLEAR MIGHT ASSIST THE COMMISSION IN DEVELOPING RATE STRUCTURES THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE CHALLENGES FACING THE MOST VULNERABLE AND LOW INCOME CUSTOMER GROUPS. THIS MAY INCLUDE SOME SUGGESTIONS THE DOCTOR TONY SPOKE OF EARLIER SUCH AS INCLUDING REVIEW OF CUMULATIVE IMPACTS OF RATE INCREASES REQUESTED BY UTILITIES AND SETTING POTENTIAL LIMITS ON THE INCREASE. THE LEGISLATURE CAN ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DIRECT RELIEF TO CUSTOMERS WHO ACCUMULATED ARREARS REACHES DURING THE KOPET PANDEMIC. THE DEBT RELIEF THAT HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN AUTHORIZED IS ONLY EXPECTED TO COVER 38% OF THE CUSTOMER DEBT INCURRED. WELL THIS IS AN ENORMOUS HELP IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF CUSTOMER DATA AT THIS TIME. BUT THERE'S BEEN EXTENSIVE DIALOGUE ABOUT COST THAT COULD BE TAKEN OUT OF RATES AND COVERED THROUGH OTHER ASPECTS OF THE STATE BUDGET. US CENTER FOR ACCESSIBLE TECHNOLOGY ADDS TO THE VOICES SUGGESTING THAT WILDFIRE MITIGATION WOULD BE APPROPRIATE- AS A ONE AS ONE TIME EXPENDITURES THAT COULD BE PAID BY TAXPAYERS RATHER THAN RATEPAYERS. THIS WOULD HAVE ADDITIONAL RIPPLE EFFECT BEYOND THE BENEFITS SPOKEN OF PREVIOUSLY IN THAT STATE INVESTMENT WOULD NOT ADD TO THE UTILITY RATE BASE AND SO THE COSTS OF THE STATE INVESTMENTS WOULD NOT BE PART OF THE UTILITIES UP COST. THE RATE OF RETURN. SO THAT WOULD BE NOT JUST THE IMMEDIATE BENEFIT OF PUTTING COSTS ON TAXPAYERS RATHER THAN RATEPAYERS BUT IT WOULD COULD DECREASE COSTS MOVING FORWARD. JENNIFER ACCEPTABLE TECHNOLOGY ALSO SUPPORTS A BROADER FUNDING OF TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION AND WE THINK THAT THERE ARE INTERESTING SUGGESTIONS WHETHER THAT'S CORRECT. BUT CASHIER FUNDING FOR A TRANSPORTATION SECTOR FUNDING. WE DO NOT SUPPORT THE MOVEMENT OF LOW INCOME SUBSIDIES THE CARE AND FERRE PROGRAM OUT OF REPAIR SUPPORT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE LIE HE PROGRAM IS AN UNFORTUNATE EXAMPLE OF A LOW INCOME SUBSIDY THAT HAS BEEN USED AS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL YEAR UPON YEAR AND FUNDING FOR THAT PROGRAM ISNEVER SHARED. THAT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS WHO DEPEND ON CARE CAN'T HAVE A SITUATION LIKE THAT WHICH IS FACED BY CUSTOMERS WHO RELY ON THE LIGHT HE- SO THE THESE ARE THAT THERE'S ROOM FOR A LOT OF- CREATIVE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO FUND IMPORTANT PROGRAMS THAT SHARE GARCIA I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT REVIEW OF OTHER COMMISSION OF MANAGED PROGRAMS AND- WHILE I HAVEN'T DONE AN EXTENSIVE REVIEW AT THIS TIME I WOULD WELCOME RECONIDERATION OF CERTAIN PROGRAMS- THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR AWHILE TO SEE WHETHER THEY'RE STILL ACHIEVING THE GOALS THAT THEY WERE INITIALLY INTENDED FOR. WE KNOW FROM CONDEMN EXAMPLE THAT IT'S MUCH HARDER TO ELIMINATE THE PROGRAM THAT EXISTS THAN IT IS TO CREATE A NEW PROGRAM- SO LOOKING WITH FRESH EYES MIGHT BE A USEFUL TASK TO UNDERTAKE. AND FINALLY THE LEGISLATURE CAN ADDRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF SHAREHOLDER CONTRIBUTIONS TO AFFORDABILITY SOLUTIONS. YEAH YOU JUST LIKE TO SAY BEFORE THE COMMISSION THAT WERE ALL IN THE CURRENT CRISIS TOGETHER BUT THEY ACTIVELY RESIST MOST EFFORTS TO ENCOURAGE SHAREHOLDER CONTRIBUTIONS SO WHETHER THIS IS THREE RETURN ON EQUITY- THE EVALUATIONS- OR OTHER MEANS MAKING SURE THAT SHAREHOLDERS ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM I'M SORRY. PART OF PART OF THE SOLUTION- IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO TAKE. MY LAST RECOMMENDATION BUT IS LOOKING AT- THE LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENT THAT ESSENTIAL SUPPLIES OF ELECTRICITY MUST BE AFFORDABLE TO CUSTOMERS. RIGHT NOW THAT SECTION THREE EIGHTY TO BE IF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE. SO THE COMMISSION IS AWARE THAT ESSENTIAL SUPPLIES OF ELECTRICITY IT REQUIRED TO BE AFFORDABLE. BUT IT'S NEVER BEEN TO FIND EXACTLY WHAT OTHERS ESSENTIAL SUPPLIES ACTUALLY ARE. THE COMMISSION HAS AUTHORIZED TO STUDY TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT YOU SAID JUST A CENTRAL. WE WERE STRONG PROPONENTS OF THAT STUDY AND APPRECIATE IT. BUT WITH THE MOV TOWARDS INCREASED ELECTRIFICATION TO ADVANCE CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. THE NATURE OF ESSENTIAL USAGE IS LIKELY TO CHANGE RAPIDLY SO IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN CREATING A SHARED UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT MEANS TO EVALUATE THE USAGE THAT'S ESSENTIAL FOR PARTICULAR CUSTOMERS- THESE ARE. BROAD SUGGESTIONS THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR DISCUSSION AND DEBATE. MY ROLE HERE TODAY IS TO MAKE SURE THAT IN THAT DISCUSSION AND DEBATE THE NEEDS OF THE MOST VULNERABLE CUSTOMERS WHO MIGHT HAVE AT LEAST ABILITY TO ADAPT ARE ALL TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AND I THINK YOU'VE DONE EXACTLY THAT AND WE APPRECIATE YOU- CLOSING OUT THE- PANELIST- BECAUSE I THINK- OFTENTIMES. THERE THERE MAY NOT BE- AS CONSIDERATION ON THE FRONT END OF THESE DISCUSSIONS. OF FOR THE IMPORTANT POPULATION THAT THAT WE REPRESENT IN THE YEAR REPRESENTING IN TODAY'S. CONVERSATION SO THANK YOU I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON MY LOOK TO MY RIGHT TO HAVE. MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY QUESTIONS- WE WILL- PROCEED WITH A PUBLIC COMMENT SOMEONE THANK YOU AND ALL THE REST OF THE PANELISTS. WHO HAVE JOINED US TODAY FOR THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING WE'RE GOING TO ASK NOW THAT- WE OPEN UP THE PUBLIC COMMENTS. PUBLIC COMMENTS- WILL BE- RESTRICTED TO A MINUTE AND A PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME THAT WAS A SHE REPRESENT- ONCE WE GO AFTER THE PUBLIC COMMENT HERE IN PERSON WE'LL SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE. REMOTELY WANTING TO SPEAK BOTH FROM A RUMOR FROM THE MODERATORS A TELEPHONE SERVICE SO. WE WILL BEGIN PUBLIC COMMENTS. YEAH HI. ARE YOU READY FOR THE PHONE LINES ARE JUST IN THE ROOM THERE MISTER CHAIR. WE ARE DOING THE IN PERSON- PUBLIC COMMENTS FIRST AND THEN WE WILL CALL ON. THE PHONE LINE- COMMENTS THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU CHECK- MUCH. YEAH THE HEAD THANKS ADAM SMITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON KEEPING IT VERY BRIEF NOTES A LONG DAY- I THINK WE KNOW IT'S- CLEAR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT LONG TERM GOALS CARBON NEUTRALITY SB ONE HUNDRED. AND THOSE ARE NOT GOING TO BE FREE SO I THINK THE REAL QUESTION YOU GUYS TOUCH ON TODAY IS WHO SHOULD PAY. AND ARE THERE WAYS TO KIND OF REDUCED RATES AS WE ALECTRA FI I THINK THIS CAN BE ONE THE CORE THEMES OF THE NEXT YOU KNOW THIRTY YEARS IN THE STATE IS ELECTRIFYING OUR STATE'S ECONOMY. I THINK WE REALLY DO AGREE WITH WHAT WE HEARD FROM EDF AND MICHAEL COLVIN ABOUT THE NEED TO LOOK AT ENERGY SHARE OF WALLET THERE THAT FROM OUR OWN ANALYSIS AND THEIR RESOURCES BOARD IS DOING THE SAME. YOU CAN HAVE INCREASES IN ELECTRIC RATES MAYBE EVEN INCREASES ELECTRIC BILLS BUT THE SAME TIME IF YOU'RE REDUCING YOUR USAGE OF GASOLINE OR NATURAL GAS YOUR TOTAL SPEND THE TOTAL SPEND YOUR HOUSEHOLD AS ON ENERGY COULD BE REDUCED AND IF WE LOOK AT OUR ANALYSIS WHICH IS PUBLIC. GO OUT TO TWENTY FORTY FIVE WE SEE AN INCLUDING INFLATION ALL THOSE AT ALL THE REST- ONE THIRD REDUCTION IN TOTAL ENERGY SPEND THE MONEY AMONG HOUSEHOLDS ACHIEVING CARBON. NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE SO I THINK THERE'S LIKE WE HEARD BEFORE YOU CAN STILL ACHIEVE THE LONG TERM ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS OF THE STATE IN AN AFFORDABLE MANNER. LAST POINT I'LL MAKE BEFORE I LEAVE IS THAT YOU KNOW WE HEARD ABOUT R. B. E. APPLICATION SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON'S BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION APPLICATION- THERE WAS A CLAIM BY MARK TONY I THINK MAYBE IT'S JUST MOVING THROUGH NUMBERS FAST THAT IT WOULD ONLY SUPPORT TEN THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS. WERE ACTUALLY OUR PROPOSAL WOULD WHICH IS PENDING BEFORE THE PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION WOULD INSTALL TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND HEAT PUMPS SO AT MY HOUSE I HAVE ONE HEAT PUMP SO YOU KNOW YOU COULD KINDA DO THE MATH THERE IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER. AND IN FACT SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS WILL RECEIVE PANEL UPGRADE SO IT'S A LOT BIGGER THAN TEN THOUSAND ALL CINNAMON NOTE I KNOW WE HAD A LEAVE BUT I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH THAT. THANKS YOUR TIME IN THE GREATER. THANK YOU. THE GOOD AFTERNOON YET MISTER CHAIRMAN VALERIE TORELLO- PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE HEARING TODAY REALLY APPRECIATE THE FOCUS ON ALL OF THE IDEAS ALL OF THE PROPOSED- SOLUTIONS FOCUS- AND ONE AS THE COMMITTEE TO THINK ABOUT- THE SOLUTIONS AND SOME SHORT TERM AND LONGER TERM VIEWS- THE SO FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A LOT OF MENTIONED TODAY ABOUT RATE DESIGN- AND SOMETIMES THOSE CAN BE- A LITTLE BIT MORE LONGER TERM BUT THEY'RE IMPORTANT LIKE THAT WHAT WAS BROUGHT UP TODAY ABOUT FIXED CHARGES- IT'S- PROBABLY TIME FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO RE EXAMINE THE- THE- CONSTRAINTS IN AB THREE TWENTY SEVEN THAT WAS BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN. THAT WAS DEBATED IN THE LEGISLATURE ON FIXED CHARGES AND OUR STRUCTURES REALLY AREN'T IN LINE NOW WITH OUR ELECTRIFICATION AND CLIMATE GOALS SO THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE OF- SOME MORE DISCUSSION- AND THEN ALSO P. GENIE IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF. THESE NONTRADITIONAL SOURCES OUTSIDE FUNDING- FOR- OUR CUSTOMERS ESPECIALLY THOSE MOST VULNERABLE FOR RATE RELIEF- IT WAS ALSO MENTIONED LAST YEAR. THE ARREARS THE ONE BILLION ON THAT YOU KNOW A LETTER CAN GAS SIDE FOR CUSTOMERS. BECAUSE WE ANTICIPATE OUR LOW AND MODERATE INCOME CUSTOMERS ARE STILL GOING TO HAVE NEEDS SO- THOSE ARE SOME VERY NEAR TERM- AND THAT MONEY IS ALREADY OUT THE DOOR FOR PG&amp;E CUSTOMERS. AND THEN FINALLY- DISCUSSIONS LIKE- GETTING PUBLIC PURPOSE PROGRAM OR PPP CHARGES OFFER THE BILL ARE VERY WORTHY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING MORE DISCUSSIONS WITH THIS COMMITTEE ABOUT THOSE PROPOSALS THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WEEK- I'M BILL JULIAN MEMBER PUBLIC WANTS TO GET IN THE MICROPHONE PLEASE. THE BILL JULIAN I'M A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC I WAS THE CHIEF CONSULTANT TO THIS COMMITTEE OF BACK IN THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES WHEN WE'RE CHAIRED IT. I WAS THE LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION DURING THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY CRISIS. I WANT TO SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS FIRST. MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M VERY IMPRESSED THAT YOU ARE FOCUSED ON. A RIGOROUS APPROACH TO RATE PAYER IMPACTS OFWHAT'S HAPPENING WITH ELECTRIC RATES ELECTRIC COSTS IN THIS STATE. BUT I ALSO WANT TO. TELL YOU THAT SOME OF THE LESSONS THAT WE LEARNED DURING THE ENERGY CRISIS WAS THAT CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO CONTROL THOSE COSTS. IS LIMITED BY THINGS THAT HAPPENED DURING THE REGULATION. SO I WANT TO FOCUS ON WHAT I EMPHASIZE. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. THE STATE AND THE FEDS SO FOR EXAMPLE TRANSMISSION COSTS THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION- CONTROLS THOSE COSTS AND IS EXTREMELY GENEROUS WITH CALIFORNIA RATEPAYER DOLLARS IN A WAY THAT. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO CLARIFY. THAT IS TO SOME EXTENT A QUESTION OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR WHICH IS A CALIFORNIA. NONPROFIT CORPORATION SUBJECT TO CALIFORNIA CONTROL BUT WHICH IS AT THIS POINT IN CONTROL OF WHOLESALE ENERGY MARKETS ONE AND TWO TRANSMISSION COSTS IN CALIFORNIA YOU NEED TO TAKE A VERY CLOSE LOOK AT THAT AND YOU NEED TO HAVE A VERY SHARP PENCIL ON THOSE TRANSMISSION COST. GIVE YOU JUST ONE EXAMPLE. MISTER CORK INDICATED THAT OVER THE LAST. IN IN IN A QUESTION OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. INVESTMENT IN TRANSMISSION AS THE SINGER FROM DISTRIBUTION HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON SAID AND SAN DIEGO GAS AND ELECTRIC THAT'S BECAUSE THE PROFITS AVAILABLE FROM FIRST REGULATION ARE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THEY ARE UNDER CALIFORNIA. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON I HAS A DIFFERENT- SEPARATION BETWEEN TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION DISTRIBUTION AS STATE JURISDICTIONAL AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON'S TRANSMISSION BECAUSE HAVE GREAT HAVE INCREASED AT A MUCH SLOWER RATE. AND HAVE THE OTHER UTILITIES SO THAT ISSUE OF STATE CONTROL OVER THE CALIFORNIA ISO IS SO YOU REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT. SECOND I WANNA. EMPHASIZED REEMPHASIZE CINEMARK TONY SAID WHICH IS TRANSPARENCY OF COSTS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF INFORMATION TODAY ABOUT COST OF CAPITAL ABOUT SECRET DEALS AND SO ON AND SO FORTH IT. ARE YOU NEED TO INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY OF COSTS IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT INCLUDES SPECIFICALLY COSTS AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ONE THING THAT YOU CAN DO. NOW IS TO REPEAL SECTION FOR FIFTY FOUR POINT FIVE G. OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE WHICH CREATES A SECRET PROCESS FOR LONG TERM CONTRACTS AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. I WON'T GO INTO THE WEEDS ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS BUT WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT HOW COSTS OF RENEWABLES FOR EXAMPLE ARE DECLINING WE DON'T KNOW AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER THOSE DECLINING COSTS ARE ACTUALLY REFLECTED IN THE CONTRACTS IF UTILITIES ARE SIGNING- FOR- OF PROCURE IN THEIR PROCUREMENT PROCEEDINGS BECAUSE OF WHAT'S CALLED THE PROCUREMENT REVIEW GROUP WHICH IS AUTHORIZED. BY THAT SECTION OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED FINALLY. THE ISSUE OF TAX PAYER VERSES RATEPAYER DOLLARS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE. A LARGE NUMBER OF. TAXPAYER DOLLARS THAT ACTUALLY GO INTO UTILITY INVESTMENTS THEY'RE CALLED. XCELERATED DEDUCTIONS FOR ACCELERATE DEPRECIATION AND FOR INVESTMENT TAX CREDITS THEIR RATEPAYER PROVIDED DOLLARS HOW THEY ARE ACCOUNTED FOR THE RATEMAKING PROCESS HOWEVER IS VERY OPAQUE I WON'T AGAIN I WON'T GO INTO THE WEEDS BUT YOU NEED TO BE LOOKING AT. THE RATE PAYER CONTRIBUTIONS THROUGH THE TAX SYSTEM THAT ARE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT- THAT- AND YOU NEED IT YOU HAVE REALLY REALLY SHARP PENCIL AND THAT. I WON'T GO INTO AS I SAID I WON'T GO INTO THE WEEDS HAVE PROVIDED A SHORT OUTLINE OF THESE REMARKS TO- TO- MISS SMITH WHO'S ON YOUR- SAYING HONEY I AM HERE- RIGHT. AND TO YOUR- TO TEACH HERE CONSULTANT ALSO I'VE I'VE GOT COPIES WHICH I'LL GIVE YOU BUT- OF THE I'LL JUST I'LL JUST CLOSE WITH THAT TRANSPARENCY AND STATE FEDERAL RELATIONS CRITICAL IF YOU WANT TO CONTROL COSTS IN A IN A PRACTICAL. WAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AS WELL- AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR FEEDBACK AND- IF YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON MY JOKES ALL OF HAPPY TO TAKE THOSE TWO- BUT THAT NO SERIOUSLY THANK YOU FOR THE FEED BACK ON ON THIS- HEARING TODAY. ANY OTHER PERSONS WANT TO MAKE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS HERE IN THE ROOM.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND WE'LL GO LINE THIRTY FOUR PLEASE GO AHEAD. EUROPE IN THIRTY MARKETS WE HEAR YOU WE CAN HEAR YOU. MY NAME IS JENNIFER TANNER INDIVISIBLE CALIFORNIA GREEN TEAM- I'M APPALLED TO HEAR THE STUPID THING MAKING IT SOUND LIKE WITH COUNSELORS THE BIGGER PROBLEM THAN ESCALATING TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS. AND WALDRON MITIGATION IT'S REALLY RIDICULOUS BUT IT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE IF THE PC HAS NOT THAT WELL KNOWN CONFLICT OF INTEREST. IT SAID RECENTLY THAT THE LONG DISTANCE POWER LINES ARE THE MAJOR COSTS WITH ESCALATION.AND I COULD BUY THE FORTY. IT OF THE CAR. EIGHT THREE THE PREFERRED COULD HELP TO THE STATE. THERE CLIENTS INCLUDE PG&amp;E STAMPER AND SO. AND NINE. FIFTY PC USED TO DO FOR ENERGY. AT HOME BERKELEY. BUT IT COULD BE GENIES. CALIF IS A LOOK DIFFICULT AND YOU TO FOCUS. BOB DOLE COALITION HIT MY FROM YOU TO. YOU CONTRACT ALL TO DEFEND PGA. COMPETITOR CHALLENGE LIKELY SO FEEDING LOBBYIST ON THIS ISSUE WITH THIS SIX JUST A FEW AGO EITHER MATHIS OF INTEREST. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW BY RESPECT STUDY READ RESEARCH BY DOC COULD. IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE SO IT CAN ACTUALLY BE GIVES A OF LONG HOW LINE AND IF THEY UP TO HUNDRED DOLLARS THEY PAIRS OF THE NEXT THIRTY. WATCHING WE ARE IN A IN. TALKS OVER A PROVEN TO HELP NOT IN THE POWER. AND WILL HELP WITH THE BY COST OF GAS AS WELL. NINETY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LETTING ME. THANK YOU NEXT UP CALLER. AB YOU ARE OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THIS IS PATRICK WELCH WITH THE CALIFORNIA MISSED LEAD TO THESE SUBJECTS FROM REPRESENT LOCALLY REGULATED PUBLIC ON ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT PROVIDE AFFORDABLE RELIABLE CLEAN ELECTRICITY 25% STATE WE APPRECIATE THAT CHAIRED THE COMMITTEE HOLDING. THIS HEARING TODAY AND FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY THAN THAT ARE YOU COUNTERPARTS YOU MAY DID WRITE DTA TO THE COMMITTEE SHOWING THAT OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES. THE PRICE OF Q. U. ELECTRICITY AND OUTPACED THE NATIONAL RIGHT MCCARTY COPS BY OVER FIFTY PERCENT. AND MOVING FORWARD WE SEE ADDITIONAL RATE INCREASES THAT THE UNAVOIDABLE AS UTILITIES INCLUDING PEER YEARS BACK WHO TRANSITION OF OWNERSHIP 100% CLEAN ELECTRIC GRID. NEW RESEARCH SAYS BILLING AT TRENT. RATHER COST PRESSURES SUCH AS WELL EDUCATION. TRANSACTION A TRANSMISSION AND WHETHER THAT ONE BECAUSE YOU CALL OUR CUSTOMERS BUT WE DO SEE IT AS A SIGNIFICANT COST PRESSURE. AND WE AGREE THAT MORE TRANSMISSION LIKELY NEED TO BE BUILT AND THE PROBLEM YOU'VE GOT GREAT. BUT ONE ANALYSIS WE'VE SEEN OF THE KITE SAYS TWENTY YEAR OUTLOOK SHOWS THAT THE TRANSMISSION ACCESS CHARGE WOULD INCREASE FROM SIXTEEN AND A HALF DOLLARS TODAY PER MEGAWATT HOUR. TO FORTY THREE DOLLARS AFTER MEGAWATT HOUR BY THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY SIX THE COPLEY PASSED ON TO CONSUMERS IT'S NOT A. IT'S NOT A SMALL NOT MARKET YOUR- THERE'S ALSO TO KEEP REVENUE PER. EVERY FOR KOBE NINE. MISTER CHAIR. YOU RIGHT NOW- EARLIER ON AND- THAT COMMITTEE HEARING. THE LEGISLATIVE ENACTED CALIFORNIA RIDGE PAYMENT. IT'S BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL HAVING HELPED OVER THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PA YOU CUSTOMERS YEP TWO HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. IN UNPAID BILLS. BUT THEY'RE STILL UNMET NEED FOR CARE YOUR CUSTOMERS OF FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS WE THINK THERE ARE STILL SUFFICIENT FEDERAL FUNDS ON THE TABLE TO COVER THIS GAP. INCLUDING AT THE WHEN ARE WE PARTY. YOU MAY BELIEVE THAT WRITER. YEAH COMPARATIVE AS CALIFORNIANS INCREASINGLY RHINO CHRISTY FOR MANY FACETS OF THEIR LIVES. DALY IT'S A COPULATE PROPOSED COULD JEOPARDIZE THE STATE'S BROADER CRIME BECAUSE- BECAUSE A GROWING NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS POWER THEIR VEHICLES AS WELL THEIR WATER HEATERS AND HOMES ELECTRICITY. WE AGREE WITH THE CONVERSATION TODAY THAT LOOKING AT ONE TIME SPENDING ON THINGS LIKE A REAR GATE IS. CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENTS IN TRANSMISSIONS IS VERY WORTHY OF. DISCUSSION AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT OKAY LINE EIGHTY ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MICHAEL BOOKER DORO ON BEHALF OF THE AGRICULTURAL ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION- JUST. THINKING BACK A LITTLE BIT I'VE BEEN REPRESENTING AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE P. YOU SEE NOW FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. AND AFFORDABILITY OF RATES HAS BEEN AN ISSUE I THINK IN EVERY ONE OF THOSE YEARS IT'S GROWN TO A CRISIS PROPORTION NOW THOUGH IN TERMS OF NEEDING TO BE ADDRESSED RATES ARE SKYROCKETING CALIFORNIA NOT JUST FOR RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS THIS YEAR HER TODAY. BUSINESS CUSTOMERS INCLUDING AGRICULTURE AND FOOD PROCESSING CUSTOMERS THAT WE REPRESENT. I WE'RE HITTING A TIPPING POINT IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE IN GLOBAL MARKETS WHAT WE MUST COMPLETE. YEAH WE CAN TALK ABOUT RATES AND BILLS AND M. SPOKE TO ONE OF SUGGESTED RATES ARE IMPORTANT GOALS ARE IMPORTANT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT REALLY APPLIES TO THE RESIDENTIAL SECTOR NEVER HAVE BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE RESIDENTIAL SECTOR. TO PAY FAR HIGHER THAN AVERAGE TYPICALLY THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY FOR INLAND EMPIRE OR ONE MORE REGIONS OF THE STATE WERE- CONDITIONING AT SUCH A MAJOR USER ALEXA THREE BUT THE BUSINESS SECTOR THERE'S NO QUESTION RATES ARE IMPORTANT AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTANT BECAUSE- TAKES THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO PRODUCE AN ALMOND OR APPLE OR ANY WIDGET. IN CALIFORNIA AS IT DOES ANYWHERE ELSE MAYBE MORE BECAUSE. WE PUMP GROUNDWATER JUNE. BROKE UP IN THE STATE SO GETTING UNDER CONTROL BECAUSE AS WE MOVE FOR. THERE ARE LITERALLY TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF. RATE INCREASESSPENDING. ATTHE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION RIGHT NOW TODAY. THAT WILL BE ACTED ON IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AND ONCE THEY'RE MOVED INTO RATE BASE. UNWINDING THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE. AND SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT IF WE'RE GONNA DO SOMETHING ABOUT AFFORDABILITY I HOPE UNDER THE NEW LEADERSHIP IN THIS COMMITTEE. HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE IN MR GARCIA AND YOU AS THE NEW CHAIR. BUT I THINK WE CAN MAKE SOME SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARDS FINALLY GETTING THE STRESS. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU NEXT WEEK- THANK YOU WILL BOTTOM LINE TWENTY EIGHT YOU ARE OPEN. WELL DAVID REINER CINEMA HOMEOWNER IN HUNTINGTON BEACH CALIFORNIA. THE CDC KNOWLEDGE IS THE PRIMARY COST DRIVERS FOR ELECTRICITY COSTS HAVE BEEN THE COPS NATURAL GAS AND THE MAINTENANCE OF TRANSMISSION LINES AND ONE PARTICULAR ALSO THE INSURANCE. THAT HAVE BEEN REQUIRED BECAUSE OF THE FIRES THAT ARE. INADEQUATE MAINTENANCE OF THOSE TRANSMISSION LINES. CAPSULAR SO RIGHT YOU DON'T REDUCING GAS YOU DON'T HAVE TRANSMISSION LINE CALL. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE CITY DEMAND OF THE STATE'S INCREASED DUE TO ELECTRICAL CARS AND ELECTRIFICATION OF HOMES REPLACING A GAS FIRED FURNACES AND WATER HEATERS WHICH HE POPS. RATHER THAN DIGGING- COMMISSION OF THOSE WHO HAVE TAKEN THE LEAD IN DECARBONIZATION BY ROUTINE VESTING IN ROOFTOP SOLAR. WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN HELP LOW INCOME- PRESIDENT'S ACCESS ROOFTOP SOLAR AND ALSO TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN ROOFTOP SOLAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT CALLER. WE WILL GO TO LINE FIFTY TWO YOUR OPEN. HI THIS IS ROB CALLING FROM SAN JOSE I'M A MEMBER OF THE SOLAR RIGHTS ALLIANCE THE CPC AGAIN SCAPEGOATS ROOFTOP SOLAR IS A COST DRIVER INTERESTINGLY THERE ARGUMENT FOR KASHIF IS MORE FROM ATM REIMBURSEMENT TO THE RATEPAYERS CONSERVING WEISS OF CPC NOW DEMONIZING CONSERVATION. BEATING LESS POWER BIG TIME SAVES EVERYBODY MONEY EXCEPT THE UTILITIES MISSILES BLESS NEED MEANS LESS TRANSMISSION GEAR TRANSMISSION LINES MEANS PURIFIERS HERE SHUT OFFS AND LOWER COSTS READ THE VIBRANT STUDY WHY IS THIS MESSAGE ABOUT THE MESSENGER HEARING THE CPUC RELIES ON SOURCES THAT ARE FUNDED BY THE UTILITIES. IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO PUT AN END TO SUCH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IF YOU DO NOT ACT EXPECT MANY MORE MEETINGS LIKE THIS ONE WITH YET MORE. EXCUSES THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WEEK- SO THE LIGHTS OF ONE PLEASE GO AHEAD. FIFTY FOUNDER THEN I'M THE FOUNDER OF INDIVISIBLE ROCK VALLEY THE RED OF LYNCH A FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE CPC RECENTLY SAID THAT. CALIFORNIA UTILITIES MAKE MONEY BY RECEIVING A PROFIT ON THEIR ASSETS. THE UTILITY CAN INCREASE ITS PROFIT BY BUILDING MORE ASSETS INCLUDING POWER LINES AND OTHER EQUIPMENT IF THEY CAN KILL ROOFTOP SOLAR THEN THEY NEED MORE TRANSMISSION LINES AND THEY PROFIT EVEN MORE. WHEN HE SAID HE THINKS IT'S REALLY ABOUT WHO TO BLAME FOR HIGH ELECTRICITY RATES. BY BLAMING HIGH RATES ON SOLAR OWNERS UTILITIES AND REGULATORS ARE TURNING ATTENTION AWAY FROM THEIR MANY DECISIONS THAT CONTRIBUTED MUCH MORE TO HIGH RATE. INCLUDING THE COST OF WILDFIRE LIABILITY AND MANY DECISIONS THAT HELP UTILITIES AT THE EXPENSE OF CONSUMERS COMPARED TO THOSE EXPENSES ANY HARDSHIP RELATED TO ROOFTOP SOLAR IS TINY AND TO FOCUS ON THAT IS THE PROBLEM IS DISINGENUOUS AND ABHORRENT HE% SAID. AND I'D LIKE TO SAY I WAS THE CONCERN FOR LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THE AIR POLLUTION HEALTH AND CLIMATE DAMAGE TO THEIR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE UTILITIES FACT THE POOR NOT. THE WEALTHY. YOU'LL LOSE AND PRO POOR COMMUNITIES NOT MIDDLE INCOME WEALTHY. ROOFTOP SOLAR REDUCE ANY FOR FIVE FUEL I'M NOT HELPS WITH. COMMUNITY CLIMATE AND CUT DOWN ON COSTS YOU IN CHRIS. THE CPU LAST YEAR TO THE WHOLE WHITE PAIR SHOWING ESCALATING OF LONG DISTANCE POWER LINES AND WILDFIRE MITIGATION ARE WHAT IS DRIVING UP THE RATE. CPUC ALSO POINTED OUT THAT UTILITIES ARE INCENTIVIZED MORE RATEPAYER DOLLARS ON LONG DISTANCE POWER LINES BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THEY MAKE THEIR MONEY. GIVEN THAT WHY ARE WE NOT TALKING ABOUT HOW TO REDUCE THE NEED FOR AS MANY LONG DISTANCE POWER LINE. AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN RATE PAYERS STATED TWO POINT SIX BILLION IN CANCEL POWER LINE PROJECT THANKS TO ROOFTOP SOLAR AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. I WISH THEM THE CONCERN FOR LOW INCOME RATEPAYERS FROM SOME OF THIS PANEL TOOK INTO ACCOUNT- ALL OF THAT. AND THAT ROOFTOP SOLAR IS THE CHEAPEST CLEANEST FORM OF ENERGY OR THE LEAF SPRING FOR THE MOST BRING THANK YOU WHAT I HEARD. CAN YOU THINK. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. NEXT CALLER. THANK YOU ENSURE WE WILL ALIGN SIXTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. BY SIXTY ARE YOU MUTED. CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES HELLO. REALLY LINES UP WITH THE SOLE RIGHTS ALLIANCE- G. COMMITTEE MEMBERS REGIONAL STATES INFORMATIONAL HEARING IS TRYING TO IDENTIFY LIKE CALIFORNIANS ARE EXPERIENCING RECORD HIGH ELECTRIC AND GAS BILLS. WELL WE KNOW WHY RATES ARE HIGHER THE CBC DESCENT LAST YEAR AND IT'S ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY THE BILL WITH A WHITE PAPER THAT SHOWING HOW THE ESCALATING COSTS OF LONG DISTANCE POWER LINES WATER MITIGATION- WHAT'S DRIVING UP ELECTRICITY RATES. WE ALL KNOW THIS AND UTILITIES HAVE ALSO INSTEAD OF BEING INCENTIVIZED MORE WEIGHT PAYER DOLLARS A NEW LONG DISTANCE PIPELINES BECAUSE HOUSING THAT'S. HOW THEY'RE GUARANTEED THEIR PROFITS. SO BASED ON THIS I FEEL THE SAME WAY THE RENEWABLE PA FOR THE PART STATE IN THE COUNTRY. IS BEING CONTROLLED BY THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY COMPANIES. THAT ARE ONLY INTERESTED IN BOOSTING THEIR BOTTOM LINE. IT IS PROPOSAL. ATTEMPTS TO CREATE A NEW NEW ENTRY GUIDELINES BASED ON POLICY PROVIDED BY ALEC. THE RIGHT WING THINK TANK. AND IS AIMED AT PUNISHING CURRENT AND FUTURE ROOFTOP SOLAR OWNERS WITH A NEW SOLAR TAX. CALIFORNIA REPAIRS COULD SAVE UP TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. VOIDED POWER LINES THINKING IF WE KEEP ROOFTOP SOLAR. AND BATTERIES ALIVE AND GROWING. SO IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT A REAL SOLUTION TO OUR ENERGY COSTS WE NEED TO STOP BLAMING ROOFTOP SOLAR HAVE REDUCE OUR NEED FOR EXPENSIVE LONG DISTANCE POWER LINES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU NEXT CALLER. YOUR NEXT WE'RE GONNA GO TO LINE THIRTY EIGHT YOU ARE OPEN. YES HELLO ERIC YES. GREAT THANK YOU MY NAME IS DAN SCHWARTZMAN THE POLICY MANAGER FOR THE CLEAN. STATE AGENCIES AND I JUST WANTED TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THE NEED FOR A BALANCED PLANNING PROCESS- IN PARTICULAR AS THE TOTAL GROSS LOADING OF THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM HAS GONE DOWN ELECTRIC RATES HAVE CONTINUED TO SKYROCKET AND IF YOU BREAK THAT DOWN FURTHER THE ACTUAL RATE OF ENERGY IS LESS THAN THE COST TO TRANSMIT TRANSMITTING THAT ENERGY AND THAT COMES FACE TO FACE WITH YOU TOLD A CONFLICT OF INTEREST THAT COMES FROM A HIGH RATE OF RETURN TRANSACTION LINES- TRANSMISSION LINES ARE. IN FACT THIRTY TO FIFTY YEAR HELLO IT GETTING DOUBLE DIGIT RETURNS THERE IS A HUGE REASON FOR THEM TO CONTINUE BUILDING MORE TRANSMISSION WHY. EVEN MORE COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS. ARE EASILY AVAILABLE. AVERAGE CAP THAT INVESTMENT IN TRANSMISSION WHICH WOULD BE THE FACE VALUE PROP PROJECT J. TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE LIFETIME OF THE PROJECT TWENTY PUTTING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE COSTS WILL RESULT IN OVER NINE TIMES THAT COST TO THE GREAT PAIR. SO WHAT WE NEED TO BE GETTING IS A MORE BALANCED PLANNING PROCESS THAT VALUES DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES AND MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS THEY CAN BRING TO COMMUNITY- AND SECOND OF ALL WE NEED MORE TRANSPARENCY IN THE TRANSMISSION PLANNING PROCESS. TRANSACTION RATES AND THE RATE OF INVESTMENT HAS GOT OVER BLACK DECADE. IN PARTICULAR OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS THAT RATE HAS INCREASED AND IT'S CONTINUING TO INCREASE. ICHIMI SERVICE TERRITORY MORE THAN 50% OF TRANSMISSION PROJECT OUR SELF APPROVED WITHOUT ANY INVOLVEMENT OR SIGNIFICANT INVOLVEMENT FROM THE STATE IT SUCKS. WE NEED A MORE BALANCED TRANSMISSION PLANNING PROCESS. A PROCESS THAT CONTINUES CONSIDERS LOCAL RESOURCES AND FINALLY NEED TO ALIGN PROFIT WRAPPING UTILITIES WITH THE PEOPLE THROUGH PERFORMANCE BASED METRICS. AND AS A WAY TO- REPLACE THE TRADITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK. NEXT WE'LL GO TO LINE SIXTY THREE YOU ARE OPEN. SIXTY THREE PLEASE GO AHEAD. OH ONE MORE SHOT SIXTY THREE WOULD YOU LIKE TO TESTIFY TODAY OR GET PUBLIC COMMENT. I'M MOVING ALONG WITH OUR LINE FIFTY EIGHT YOU ARE OPEN. WELL YEAH CHARLES ADDAMS ALBION POWER COMPANY BUT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO LOOK AT PRIVATE INVESTMENT IN SOLAR IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT THROUGH THE LENS OF WHAT IT ACTUALLY PROVIDES. IMPORTANT NOTE THE UNITED STATES IS 5% OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION CONSUMING WE'RE DOWN 222% OF OUR LAND LEFT. IS NOT SUSTAINABLE AND SOLAR IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT ADDRESSES THIS UNDER CURRENT NET METERING ROOFTOP SOLAR AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY OR THE SAME DENOMINATOR BOTH ELIMINATE MANY OF THE COSTS YOU'RE DISCUSSING HERE TODAY. NEVER CAUGHT ME CREATES ENERGY AND ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR THE CONSUMER WHICH AND STAY IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY TO BUILD CALIFORNIA GREEN ECONOMIES LOCAL ECONOMIES CREATE LOCAL JOBS DECREASED INEQUALITY INCREASED WAGES HIGHER INCOME GROWTH LOWER LEVELS OF POVERTY HIGHER LEVELS OF CIVIC WELL BEING. AND LOCAL TAX REVENUE THE COMMISSION IS ENCOURAGED TO CONSIDER DAM THREE POINT OH TO DEBATE OF ONE OF MAIN STREET SOLAR VERSUS WALL STREET SOLAR. ROOFTOP SOLAR IS ONLY BEEN DOING THIS FOR FIFTEEN YEARS SO OF COURSE IT'S DISRUPTIVE BUT WE'RE ALSO CREATING 40% OF THE SOLAR THE TICKET IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHILE DESTROYING NONE OF THE ENVIRONMENT. MANY OF THE CPUC CALCULATIONS FOR SENATE BILL ONE HUNDRED DON'T EVEN CLASSIFY ROOFTOP SOLAR A CLEAN ENERGY NOR COUNT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT IN ANY WAY. THIS CUTS FOR IT IS CREATING A LOT OF FUNNY MATH WE ASK YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT ARE YOU USE COULD NOT GO CARPET BOMB ALL THE REMAINING LAND TO BUILD SOLAR FARMS AND BUILD CORRESPONDING TRANSMISSION. THE PREVIOUS CALLER STATED RATE THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE TAX SYSTEM FOR BY TAXPAYERS OF TAX CREDITS TO THE WEALTHIEST 1% WHO ARE FINDING ANSWERS OF THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY. PASS IT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE NO STAKE IN THE PRODUCTION OF THE SYSTEM SOLAR FARMS OR TAX CREDIT MARKET IT IS HARD TO DESTROY THE ENVIRONMENT AND LOCAL ECONOMIES AND CALL THIS EQUITY. SO WE HAVE A SYSTEM CURRENTLY WHERE THE SOLAR FARM DESTROYING. LANDING CANADA COUNTS TOWARD THE ARCHITECT HAD WILL GO A LONG THIRTY TWO YOUR OPEN. THANK YOU THANK YOU MY NAME IS RICK COMPSTAT CRIME- CALLING IN FROM SAN JOSE CALIFORNIA- I HAVE BUT A LOT OF CONCERNS ON. IN YOU KNOW I FEEL IF YOU IF YOU WANT TO CONTROL I ALSO WANT TO REITERATE SEVERAL POINTS THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE MADE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF GOOD POINTS MADE IF YOU WANT TO CONTROL WEIGHT HEIGHT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET GOOD INFORMATION FROM THE CQC OR THEIR CONSULTANTS. THEY ALL HELP CONFIDENTIAL- S. IT WAS SAID THE EACH IS THE PREFERRED CONSULT FOR THE C. CARE CLIENTS INCLUDE THE MOST OF THE OTHER GROUPS CAN YOU TELL SO BROUGH SOLAR COALITION TAKE MONEY FROM UTILITY BILLS BEEN REPORTED ON BY THE LA TIMES AND OTHER NEWS OUTLETS WE WILL BE. REPORT PETER IS A CONTRA. YOU UNION A CONTRACT COOLEY OF OBLIGATED TO DEFEND PG&amp;E FROM COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES LIKE ROOFTOP SOLAR PLEASE LOOK AT THEIR CONTRACT OF PG&amp;E GO OBVIOUS ON THIS ISSUE WITH THE CPUC COMMISSIONER JUST A FEW YEARS AGO WHY ISN'T THIS ILLEGAL THANK YOU SIR THAT WAS AT ALL I HAVE IS THAT- LONG TENTACLES GOT NEXT NEXT CALLER. SEVENTY EIGHT OF THE FOUR. PLEASE PROCEED YOU'RE RIGHT YES SIR YES CAN YOU HEAR ME. ALL RIGHT SO I'M ALAN MARLER MARLING WITH THE SUNRISE MOVEMENT AND- CAN YOU CONSTITUENTS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAR CON. OKAY IF YOU KNOW MISS WHY PG&amp;E IS INCREASING RATE THE CRIMINAL COMPANY IS SO GREEDY WITH CELL ALL CALIFORNIA AND SENATE ON FIRE IF IT MEANT ONE MORE QUARTER OF PROFITS. NOW IT'S FORCING US TO PEOPLE ACROSS THE TENEMENTS AND ANOTHER SECOND DRIVER ACOSTA IS LONG DISTANCE CAROLINE. THE FUTURE IS IN MICRO GRIDS OF SOLAR AND. LOCAL IN WINDFARMS. NOW I CAN BELIEVE I'VE HEARD SAY SHE ON MEASURES ARE BAKER IN EVERYONE ELSE PARROTED THE INDUSTRY TALKING POINTS ACCUSING. SOLAR BUT BEING THE PROBLEM AMIDST A CLIMATE TECH POCKET. THE PROBLEM IS. THAT IT'S AFFORDABLE ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE AND EVERYONE SHOULD GET THE. TOP SELLER YOU KNOW. GIVEN RENTERS IF YOU WANT TO REDUCE. AND CALIFORNIA FROM BURNING ALIVE THE KIND OF CRISIS THE STATE YOU'RE NASSAU ANY WORLDLY TO THE- IN THE PAST THREE THE STEEP. THANK YOU. NINE THIRTY SEVEN BECAUSE- FIND A LOT OF IN YOUR OPEN. GO AHEAD. YES WE CAN HEAR YOU VERY WELL YES WE GARY THANK YOU HI MY NAME'S ALLERGY TABLETS REIMAGINE POWER- THANKS FOR THIS HEARING TODAY IT WAS VERY INFORMATIVE I'M NOT GOINGTO REPEAT ALL OF THE COMMENTS THAT EVERYONE ELSE THAT THEY'RE ALL REALLY- VALID AND SHOULD BE REALLY SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED BY THE COMMITTEE I THINK THE LARGER ISSUE THAT THIS IS RAIN WATER PORTABILITY AND A LOT OF LONG DISTANCE POWER LINES CAUSING WILDFIRES AND BLACKOUT. IT WOULD NEED TO RALLY JUST REVISIT THE ENTIRE UTILITY BUSINESS MODEL WE NEED TO UPDATE IT FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WE ARE STILL OPERATING UNDER OUTDATED MODELS AND THE REGULATORY CONTACTED BEEN BROKEN BY THE UTILITIES IT'S TIME FOR US TO REALLY THINK ABOUT HOW WE MODERNIZE THE UTILITY BUSINESS MODEL FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND THAT INCLUDES REALLY MAKING COMMUNITY LEVEL RESOURCES LIKE MICHAEL GRANT AND DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES A LARGER PART OF OUR ENERGY FUTURE NOT JUST TRYING TO PAY THE DESERT WITH GLASS AND BUILD MORE OF THE COST OF THE- WIRES THAT ARE CAUSING. PROBLEMS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY NEXT CALLER. MY TWO PLEASE CALL AHEAD. HELLO MY NAME IS TIED INTO A LONG TIME AND ENERGY ANALYST FOR THE PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY FOUNDATION I PARTICIPATING SEVERAL PROCEEDINGS OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION INCLUDING PROVIDING EXPERT TESTIMONY ON THE NET ENERGY METERING PRECEDING. CHRISTMAS DAY THE COMMISSION AND COMMISSION STAFF COMPLETED WORK ON A DAILY BASIS BUT BEAUTY IS MADE UP OF PEOPLE AND OCCASIONALLY THEY GET THINGS WRONG JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE THE PROPOSAL THAT ENERGY METERING DECISION IS ONE SUCH INSTANCE. THE REASON I BRING THIS UP IS THAT FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN PUBLISHING INFORMATION LIKE WHAT YOU SAW TODAY IN PRESENTATION WHERE IT SAYS THAT MANIS THE COST OF INCREASED COSTS. ARGAN AND ALSO. AND INTO IMPACT COST OF THEM PROGRAM EQUAL THE BENEFITS. THE BENEFITS ALL CUSTOMERS. THE AVERAGE RESIDENTIAL ROOFTOP SOLAR ARRAY PROVIDES SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS PER YEAR IN BENEFITS. TO THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AS A WHOLE WHEN JUST CONSIDERING A REDUCTION IN TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS. THE HIGH RATE IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT CAUSED BY ROOFTOP SOLAR. HI ELECTRICITY RATES RESULT FROM THE NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING THE UTILITIES CONTINUE TO REQUEST AND THE BILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL PROFITS THE UTILITIES TAKE FROM RATE PAYERS YEAR AFTER YEAR. THAT CONCLUDES MY COMMENTS THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT CALLER. MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE EXHAUSTED THE QUEUE. PRESSURE. WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO REPEAT NO NO NO NO WE'RE FINE. BUT IT OUT ARE YOU CALLING IT A WILL WILL TAKE OF MINE IT LOOKS LIKE THERE ISN'T SO THANK YOU MR MODERATOR AND- PROCEDURE WORKERS GET WHAT R.
