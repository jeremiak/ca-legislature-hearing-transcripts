THE SPILL WE FIND THIS TO A VERY

00:28:32.811 --> 00:28:33.411
IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN

00:28:33.478 --> 00:28:34.712
WORKING ON FOR OVER FIFTEEN

00:28:34.779 --> 00:28:35.880
YEARS TO BRING ATTENTION TO THE

00:28:35.947 --> 00:28:37.415
FACT THAT FOREST BIOMASS WASTE

00:28:37.482 --> 00:28:39.517
CONTRIBUTES A LOT TOWARDS OUR

00:28:39.584 --> 00:28:40.685
AIR POLLUTION. IT DOES WHEN IT

00:28:40.752 --> 00:28:42.620
DECAYS IT EMITS METHANE WHEN

00:28:42.687 --> 00:28:44.155
IT'S LEFT ON THE FLOOR AND BUT

00:28:44.222 --> 00:28:45.857
MOST OFTEN IT'S DISPOSED OF

00:28:45.924 --> 00:28:47.425
THREE PILUM BURNING WHICH IS A

00:28:47.492 --> 00:28:49.694
SIGNIFICANT COULD CONTRIBUTION

00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:51.963
TO AIR POLLUTION ESPECIALLY PM

00:28:52.030 --> 00:28:53.064
TWO FIVE WHICH HAS A VERY

00:28:53.131 --> 00:28:54.799
SERIOUS HEALTH EFFECTS THERE'S A

00:28:54.866 --> 00:28:55.900
RECENT STUDY THAT HAS COME OUT

00:28:55.967 --> 00:28:57.869
FROM UC SAN DIEGO JUST LAST YEAR

00:28:57.936 --> 00:28:59.604
THAT SHOWING THAT PM TWO POINT

00:28:59.671 --> 00:29:00.939
FIVE FROM WILDFIRES IS ACTUALLY

00:29:01.005 --> 00:29:02.507
MUCH WORSE FOR OUR HEALTH THAN

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:05.076
OTHER TYPES OF PM SO WE NEED TO

00:29:05.143 --> 00:29:06.811
PAY EXTRA SPECIAL ATTENTION TO

00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:07.445
THE PM THAT'S COMING OUT FROM

00:29:07.512 --> 00:29:10.081
WILDFIRES ADDITIONALLY THE BLACK

00:29:10.148 --> 00:29:11.516
CARBON THAT'S EMITTED FROM

00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:12.817
WILDFIRES IS A CARBON FORCING

00:29:12.884 --> 00:29:13.985
AGENT WHICH IS HUNDREDS OF TIMES

00:29:14.052 --> 00:29:16.688
MORE POTENT. THAN CO TWO ALONE

00:29:16.754 --> 00:29:18.123
SO FOR BOTH OF THOSE REASONS AIR

00:29:18.189 --> 00:29:19.724
POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICTS TAKE

00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:21.826
VERY SERIOUSLY THE BIOMASS

00:29:21.893 --> 00:29:24.529
ISSUES THAT WE HAVE THAT YOU'VE

00:29:24.596 --> 00:29:28.199
HEARD ABOUT- FROM THE AUTHOR.

00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:29.167
ADDITIONALLY WE WOULD LIKE TO

INVESTED A LOT OF MAN HOURS AND

00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:36.341
TIME AND FINANCE INTO THESE

00:29:36.407 --> 00:29:37.942
PLANS. BUT THEY NEED HELP TO GET

ORGANIZED AND PUT THESE PLANS

00:29:39.878 --> 00:29:40.778
INTO ACTION. THIS SPECIFICALLY

00:29:40.845 --> 00:29:41.946
IS CREATING A NEW PROGRAM AT THE

PROJECTS IN THE CITY. THIS

00:45:44.842 --> 00:45:46.076
HAPPENED EVEN THOUGH THE

00:45:46.143 --> 00:45:47.544
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE

AND THIS MADE BY THIS MEAN

00:46:06.697 --> 00:46:08.332
SPIRITED AND FALSE CLAIM. THIS

00:46:08.398 --> 00:46:09.666

OF DONOR COMMUNITY. THAT HAS

00:46:32.689 --> 00:46:33.991
ALLOWED US TO SETTLE THE CASE

00:46:34.057 --> 00:46:35.692
BEFORE ANY LITIGATION AND MOVE

00:46:35.759 --> 00:46:36.894

HUNDREDS OF OTHERS DEMONSTRATES

00:46:44.434 --> 00:46:45.335
HOW THE UNFAIR AND MISUSE

00:46:45.402 --> 00:46:46.904
APPLICATION OF SEQUEL. ON THE

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:48.605

00:46:48.672 --> 00:46:50.407
EXPENSIVE EFFECT ON THE ABILITY

00:46:50.474 --> 00:46:52.476
OF ALL DEVELOPERS. THERE MUST BE

00:46:52.543 --> 00:46:53.777
A BETTER WAY UNFORTUNATELY

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:08.458
ON MORE ECONOMICALLY MARGINAL

00:47:08.525 --> 00:47:10.394
PROJECTS THAT THAT DID NOT GET

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:11.161
OFF THE GROUND AT ALL. BECAUSE

00:47:11.228 --> 00:47:12.629
THESE DEVELOPERS KNOW THE COULD

00:47:12.696 --> 00:47:14.331
NOT FINANCIALLY SURVIVE EVEN A

DISCOURAGE THESE MOST PRIVILEGED

AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO DEFEAT IN

00:48:18.061 --> 00:48:19.696
HOUSING AND WE'VE HAD A RECENT

00:48:19.763 --> 00:48:21.298
EXPERIENCE WITH THEM- BEING THAT

00:48:21.365 --> 00:48:23.233
OF A PRIVILEGE LAWSUIT THAT IF

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.935
THERE WERE THERAPY TO PROCEED

00:48:25.002 --> 00:48:26.703
WITH A 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:28.872
PROJECT IN THE CITY OF LIVERMORE

00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:30.207
AND LET THEIR FINANCING WINDOW

00:48:30.274 --> 00:48:32.175
WHICH- IT'S HARD TO CALCULATE

00:48:32.242 --> 00:48:34.578
THE DAMAGES BUT THEY HAD A SIXTY

00:48:34.645 --> 00:48:35.912
EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR TAX CREDIT

00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:37.147
ALLOCATION THAT THEY'VE HAD TO

00:48:37.214 --> 00:48:39.516
TURN BACK IN SOLELY AS THE

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:41.351
RESULT OF A OF THE CHECK WHICH

00:48:41.418 --> 00:48:43.687

CAN BE APPEALED AND CONTINUE THE

00:48:44.988 --> 00:48:47.758
DELAY- AND I THINK THE KEY

00:48:47.824 --> 00:48:49.526
MESSAGES THAT THAT THE CHILLING

00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:50.427

IT'S ACTUALLY. DIFFICULT TO

UNFORGIVING BANK FINANCING.

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:17.654
MECHANISMS THAT. IT JUST CANNOT

AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHO WHO STAND

SMITH HERE ON BEHALF OF THE

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:35.365
STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION

00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:36.233
TRADES COUNCIL- AND OPPOSITION

00:50:36.299 --> 00:50:38.902
TO THIS LEGISLATION- YOU KNOW I

00:50:38.969 --> 00:50:39.903
JUST TALKED TO THE ASSEMBLY

00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:41.304
MEMBER A FEW MINUTES AGO. I KNOW

00:50:41.371 --> 00:50:43.440
THIS IS THE FIRST COMMITTEE- BUT

00:50:43.507 --> 00:50:45.642
WE DID NOTE SOME OF SERIOUS

00:50:45.709 --> 00:50:47.244
ISSUES WITH THE BILL AS WE READ

00:50:47.310 --> 00:50:49.980
IT AS OUR TEAM AT AT AT THE AT

00:50:50.046 --> 00:50:51.715
THE BUILDING TRDES- FIRST OF

00:50:51.782 --> 00:50:53.517
ALL- THERE THE RECENT AMENDMENTS

00:50:53.583 --> 00:50:54.918
DO NOT FIX THE PROBLEMS THAT WE

00:50:54.985 --> 00:50:56.853
IDENTIFIED IN OUR LETTER-%

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:57.854
BECAUSE THE BILL STILL ALLOWS A

00:50:57.921 --> 00:51:00.090
COURT. TO REQUIRE PLAINTIFFS TO

00:51:00.157 --> 00:51:01.625
POST A BOND TO COVER COSTS AND

00:51:01.691 --> 00:51:03.093
DAMAGES TO AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.928
PROJECT WHICH AN AGENCY OR

00:51:04.995 --> 00:51:06.630
DEVELOPER CLAIM THEY WANT KERR

00:51:06.696 --> 00:51:08.398
AS A RESULT OF THE LAWSUIT.

00:51:08.465 --> 00:51:10.200
WITHOUT SUPPORTING EVIDENCE.

00:51:10.267 --> 00:51:11.868
THAT THE BILL WOULD ALSO CREATE

00:51:11.935 --> 00:51:13.603
AN UNPRECEDENTED CHANGE A LAW TO

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.639
ALLOW THE TRIAL COURT TO REQUIRE

00:51:15.705 --> 00:51:17.941
A SEQUEL PETITIONER TO POST A

00:51:18.008 --> 00:51:20.043
BOND ON ITS OWN MOTION. WITHOUT

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:22.779
BEING ASKED FOR ONE BY ANY OF

00:51:22.846 --> 00:51:24.815
THE PARTIES IN THE CASE- WE WILL

00:51:24.881 --> 00:51:26.283
REVIEW THIS IS A VIOLATION OF

00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:26.983
THE PETITIONERS DUE PROCESS

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:28.952
RIGHTS BY ALLOWING THE COURT TO

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:30.687
VOLUNTARILY TAKE SIDES WITH THE

00:51:30.754 --> 00:51:32.522
DEVELOPER MYSTICAL CASE BEFORE

00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:35.125
TRIAL. BEFORE REVIEWING THE

00:51:35.192 --> 00:51:36.293
EVIDENCE FOR THE MERITS OF THE

00:51:36.359 --> 00:51:38.195
CASE. IT WOULD ALSO BE A MAJOR

00:51:38.261 --> 00:51:40.063
VIOLATION OF THE COURT'S DUTY TO

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:41.698
IMPARTIALITY IN OF THE COURTS TO

00:51:41.765 --> 00:51:43.467
TEACH OF STAIN FROM RULING ON

00:51:43.533 --> 00:51:46.036
SUBSTANTIVE MATTERS THAT THE

00:51:46.102 --> 00:51:47.938
PARTIES HAVE NOT PLACED BEFORE

00:51:48.004 --> 00:51:49.172
IT. FOR WE JUST BELIEVE THE BILL

00:51:49.239 --> 00:51:51.808
IS UNNECESSARY BECAUSE EXISTING

00:51:51.875 --> 00:51:52.509
LOT. CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE

00:51:52.576 --> 00:51:53.443
FIVE TO NINE POINT TWO- ALREADY

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:54.044
ALLOWS DEFENDANTS TO ASK THE

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.912
COURT TO REQUIRE A BOND IF THE

00:51:55.979 --> 00:51:57.080
COURT FINDS OF THE SEQUEL

00:51:57.147 --> 00:51:58.849
LAWSUIT HAS THE EFFECT OF

00:51:58.915 --> 00:51:59.416
PREVENTING. OR DELAYING AN

AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT AND

00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:02.853
I. WANTED TO CONCLUDE WITH-

AND NINETY FIVE PER YEAR SINCE

00:52:15.832 --> 00:52:17.367
TWO THOUSAND AND TWO. THIS

00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:18.835
REPLICATION FOR CHALLENGES TO

00:52:18.902 --> 00:52:20.170

00:52:24.608 --> 00:52:26.376
OF EVERY ONE HUNDRED PROJECTS.

00:52:26.443 --> 00:52:27.511
WE DON'T THINK THERE'S A THERE

00:52:27.577 --> 00:52:30.413
THERE- I THINK EVERYBODY IN THIS

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.583

00:52:51.601 --> 00:52:53.770

OF. YOU KNOW MERIT TWO AWARDS AT

00:56:35.358 --> 00:56:36.493

TO. ISSUE A BONDING REQUIREMENT

00:56:38.928 --> 00:56:40.997

SUCCESSFUL AND IT'S FOUND THAT

00:56:42.031 --> 00:56:44.567
THIS IS. NOT A MERITORIOUS CLAIM

00:56:44.634 --> 00:56:45.602
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING TO COVER

00:56:45.668 --> 00:56:48.538

THERE'S SOMETHING TO. ACCOUNT

00:57:48.965 --> 00:57:50.900
FOR THAT AND I WILL LOOK IT DOES

00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:52.836

REVIEW PROCESS VIA SEQUEL. WELL

00:59:44.781 --> 00:59:46.849
I GUESS WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT

00:59:46.916 --> 00:59:48.952
IF THERE'S A CASE LIKE THAT

00:59:49.018 --> 00:59:49.953
WHERE YOU KNOW THEIR ADDRESS

00:59:50.019 --> 00:59:51.788
SEEN LEGITIMATE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:59:51.854 --> 00:59:53.723
IMPACTS FROM THE CASE I THINK

00:59:53.790 --> 00:59:54.824
IT'S PROBABLY UNLIKELY THAT

00:59:54.891 --> 00:59:56.259
THERE'S GOING TO BE A BOND

00:59:56.326 --> 00:59:57.060
REQUIREMENT BECAUSE AGAIN THIS

00:59:57.126 --> 01:00:00.129
IS MAY IT'S NOT SHALL REQUIRE A

01:00:00.196 --> 01:00:01.464
BONDING REQUIREMENT FOR EVERY

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:03.833
CHALLENGE. TO AFFORDABLE

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:07.403
HOUSING- PROJECT- I THINK IT IS

01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:08.471
TRYING TO GET OUT THAT LIMITED

01:00:08.538 --> 01:00:10.306
AND AGAIN SOMEONE YOU HAVE TO

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:11.174
PETITION OR THE COURT WOULD HAVE

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.010
TO DO IT ON ITS OWN MOTION- ON

01:00:14.077 --> 01:00:15.211
THE PART ABOUT THE COURT DOING

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:16.512
TIME MOTION IS CERTAINLY

01:00:16.579 --> 01:00:18.147
SOMETHING I'M WILLING TO TALK

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:19.816
ABOUT AND WHEN WE'LL BE TALKING

01:00:19.882 --> 01:00:21.184
ABOUT- IF I MOVE ON TO MISTER

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:24.554
STONES COMMITTEE- AND SO- YOU

01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.488
CAN DEFINITELY LOOK AT THAT

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:29.392
ISSUE- BUT- I DON'T SEE IT AS

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:30.026
BEING AN IMPEDIMENT LIKE IF YOU

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:33.329
HAVE A LEGITIMATE. SEQUEL

01:00:33.396 --> 01:00:34.831
LAWSUIT YOU CAN STILL BRING IT.

01:00:34.897 --> 01:00:36.699
AND YOU KNOW THERE MAY BE A

01:00:36.766 --> 01:00:39.302
BONDING REQUIREMENT REQUIRED-

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:40.436
AGAIN THAT'S NOT USUALLY LIKE

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:42.305
PUTTING UP THE FULL AMOUNT OF

01:00:42.372 --> 01:00:44.874
THE LAWSUIT IT'S A- NO PORTION

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:46.843
PERCENTAGE THERE OF SO I DON'T

01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:48.277
SEE IT IS STOPPING ANY KIND OF

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:50.880
LEGITIMATE. SEQUEL LAWSUIT WHAT

01:00:50.947 --> 01:00:52.915
IT WILL TRY AND DO IS DETER. THE

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:54.584
ONES THAT YOU KNOW AS YOU'VE

01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:55.451
NOTICED IN YOUR OWN COMMUNITY

01:00:55.518 --> 01:00:58.254
THAT ARE- YEP NOT MERITORIOUS

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:00.356
ARE REALLY JUST BEING BOUGHT

01:01:00.423 --> 01:01:01.424
BROUGHT FOR THE PURPOSES OF

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:07.030
DELAY. I HEY MISTER SEYARTO SO

01:01:07.096 --> 01:01:08.931
KIND OF IN RESPONSE TO A LITTLE

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.767
BIT WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING- BUT

01:01:10.833 --> 01:01:12.301
YEAH I'VE SEEN SEVERAL OF THESE

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:14.337
WHERE IT'S THE COMMUNITIES AND

01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:17.740
AFTER ARE BECAUSE THERE IS A-

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:19.308
AND THE DEVELOPMENT THEY DON'T

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:20.676
LIKE GOING INTO WHETHER IT'S

01:01:20.743 --> 01:01:22.745
AFFORDABLE HOW HOMES ARE HIGH

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:25.515
DENSITY HOMES OR WHATEVER AND

01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:28.484
THEY NEVER SEEM TO BE- AT A LOSS

01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:31.087
TO BE ABLE TO FIND AN ATTORNEY-

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:33.322
USUALLY THE ATTORNEY FINDS THEM.

01:01:33.389 --> 01:01:35.291
AND AND SO THEY'RE NOT THE ONES

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.060
THAT ARE KIND OF AT RISK OF

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:39.162
DOING THE SUIT ESPECIALLY IF

01:01:39.228 --> 01:01:41.764
THAT ATTORNEY IS CONFIDENT- THAT

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:44.667
THEY'RE GOING TO- PREVAIL IN A

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:46.602
IN A IN A SUIT THAT'S THAT'S

01:01:46.669 --> 01:01:49.605
FINE BUT WHAT I'VE ALSO FOUND IS

01:01:49.672 --> 01:01:50.606
THAT THESE ATTORNEYS- SOME OF

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:55.044
THEM- ENGAGE AND GET A SMALL.

01:01:55.111 --> 01:01:57.980
YEAH BASICALLY A PALE. AND THEN

01:01:58.047 --> 01:01:59.082
EVERYBODY YOU KNOW AND THE

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:01.150
PEOPLE THERE WERE NOT FOR AND

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:02.552
THEY DON'T HAVE TO PAY ANYTHING.

01:02:02.618 --> 01:02:04.554
THEY JUST LA I MEAN THEY JUST

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.522
DID DEVELOPMENT GOES FORWARD

01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:08.291
REGARDLESS OF THEIR CONCERNS.

01:02:08.357 --> 01:02:10.293
AND YOU KNOW YOU GET TO MORE

01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:12.295
STOP SIGNS PUT IN. AND THE

01:02:12.361 --> 01:02:16.766
ATTORNEY GETS D. V- A

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:19.902
SETTLEMENT- FROM FROM THAT. AND

01:02:19.969 --> 01:02:22.171
SO I DON'T THINK THE PEOPLE THAT

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:24.307
ARE ABLE TO ACCESS WILL BE

01:02:24.373 --> 01:02:26.075
UNABLE TO ACCESS BECAUSE I THINK

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:27.510
THIS PLENTY PEOPLE REPRESENTING

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:30.213
THEM. THAT'LL DO IT WITHOUT-

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:32.915
WITHOUT THEM GETTING CHARGED- SO

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:35.051
I THINK WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO

01:02:35.118 --> 01:02:37.086
HERE THE AUTHORS TRYING TO DO

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:40.623
HERE. IS NOBLE AND TRYING TO GET

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:41.824

AFFORDABLE HOUSING- SITUATION-

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:48.498

WATER AND QUITE FRANKLY FUEL AND

01:30:33.828 --> 01:30:35.196
OF WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW-

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:37.799
MINUTE DROP SO ANYTHING THAT IS

01:30:37.865 --> 01:30:40.301
DONE TO LESSEN. THE POTENTIAL

01:30:40.368 --> 01:30:41.836
WATER SUPPLY I HAVE STRONG

01:30:41.903 --> 01:30:43.905
CONCERNS ABOUT AS WELL AS WE

01:30:43.971 --> 01:30:46.140
HAVE SIX DOLLARS OUR FUEL SIX

01:30:46.207 --> 01:30:47.208
DOLLARS A GALLON FUEL NOT AN

01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:50.011
HOUR. BUT SIX DOLLARS GALLON

01:30:50.077 --> 01:30:53.181
FUEL. YAHOO KIDDING THE CUTTING

01:30:53.247 --> 01:30:54.415
YOU KNOW COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:56.350
BARRELS OF THE FUEL OUT OF THE

01:30:56.417 --> 01:30:57.151
SYSTEM I THINK COULD BE

01:30:57.218 --> 01:30:58.920
DEVASTATING AND IN THE WORLD WE

01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:00.121
LIVE IN RIGHT NOW I THINK THAT'S

01:31:00.188 --> 01:31:02.023
A LITTLE BUT THE WRONG APPROACH

01:31:02.089 --> 01:31:03.324
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING

01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:05.159
TO DO BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT

01:31:05.226 --> 01:31:06.060
RIGHT NOW THERE'S A LOT OF

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:07.895
FEASIBILITY STUDIES AT THE STATE

01:31:07.962 --> 01:31:08.963
WATER BOARD THE LOCAL WATER

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:10.131
DISTRICTS ARE DOING TO MAKE SURE

01:31:10.198 --> 01:31:12.099
THAT THIS WATER CAN BE RECLAIMED

01:31:12.166 --> 01:31:13.901
AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO TAKE

01:31:13.968 --> 01:31:15.603
A PAUSE. AND LET THEM DO IT

01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:17.238
JOBS- BECAUSE IF WE CAN RECLAIM

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:18.406
WATER WASTE WATER FROM OUR

01:31:18.472 --> 01:31:20.274
CITIES AND REVIEWS THAT I FEEL

01:31:20.341 --> 01:31:21.909
LIKE WE CAN GET THE TECHNOLOGY

01:31:21.976 --> 01:31:23.711
RIGHT REVIEWS SOME OF THIS WATER

01:31:23.778 --> 01:31:25.680
FOR OTHER ISSUES OTHER THAN JUST

01:31:25.746 --> 01:31:27.648
AGRICULTURE SO THANK YOU. YES

01:31:27.715 --> 01:31:29.951
SO. AS THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM

01:31:30.017 --> 01:31:32.486
WHICH VÀ SAID. IT'S NOT OUR

01:31:32.553 --> 01:31:34.188
INTENTION AND THAT BELIEVE THE

01:31:34.255 --> 01:31:36.791
BILL AS CURRENTLY BEING AMENDED

01:31:36.858 --> 01:31:38.593
WELL ABSOLUTELY NOT TOUCH

01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:41.128
BENEFICIAL REUSE THE PEOPLE WHO

01:31:41.195 --> 01:31:42.496
SUPPORTED THE PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE

01:31:42.563 --> 01:31:44.999
IT THIS BILL WILL BE COMPLETELY

01:31:45.066 --> 01:31:48.102
NEUTRAL ON THAT. AND WE WILL NOT

01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:50.972
SO FAR AS I CAN SEE CHANGE ONE

01:31:51.038 --> 01:31:53.407
DROP. FROM BENEFICIAL RE USE

01:31:53.474 --> 01:31:54.775
THAT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE

01:31:54.842 --> 01:31:56.644
ABSOLUTELY. SO WHAT WE'RE

01:31:56.711 --> 01:31:59.313
CONCERNED ABOUT HERE IS THE FACT

01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:00.815
THAT THE WATER BOARD REALLY

01:32:00.882 --> 01:32:03.017
DOESN'T REGULATE THESE POTS IN

01:32:03.084 --> 01:32:06.554
AN EFFECTIVE WAY- AND ALTHOUGH

01:32:06.621 --> 01:32:07.521
THE CENTRAL VALLEY REGIONAL

01:32:07.588 --> 01:32:09.056
BOARD HAS DONE A LOT OF HARD

01:32:09.123 --> 01:32:10.992
WORK ON THIS ISSUE. THE CURRENT

01:32:11.058 --> 01:32:13.060
REGULATIONS ROUND ONLINE PICTURE

01:32:13.127 --> 01:32:15.730
EXTREMELY CUMBERSOME FOR ABOUT

01:32:15.796 --> 01:32:16.797
FIVE HUNDRED OF THEM. WERE

01:32:16.864 --> 01:32:18.566
NEGATIVE IMPACTS TO GROUNDWATER

01:32:18.633 --> 01:32:20.434
QUALITY DETECTED THE REGIONAL

01:32:20.501 --> 01:32:22.670
BOARD MUST METICULOUSLY DOCUMENT

01:32:22.737 --> 01:32:25.640
THE IMPACT. AND ISSUE SHE SHOULD

01:32:25.706 --> 01:32:29.610
DESIST ORDERS. IT BY. WITH FIVE

01:32:29.677 --> 01:32:32.780
HUNDRED PIPS. YOU'RE NEVER GOING

01:32:32.847 --> 01:32:34.649
TO GET TO THE END OF THIS.

01:32:34.715 --> 01:32:36.117
REGIONAL BOARD IS ACTED TO SHUT

01:32:36.183 --> 01:32:38.853
DOWN SOME TIPS BUT THEY HAVE TO

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:39.353
ADDRESS EACH SITUATION

01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:42.757
INDIVIDUALLY. AND THE PROCEEDS

01:32:42.823 --> 01:32:44.492
CAN BE DRAGGED OUT BY LITIGATION

01:32:44.558 --> 01:32:46.360
. SO THE STAFF TIME AND

01:32:46.427 --> 01:32:47.762
RESOURCES BEING SPENT BASICALLY

01:32:47.828 --> 01:32:49.697
MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO LOOK AT

01:32:49.764 --> 01:32:51.599
ALL FIVE HUNDRED OF THESE

01:32:51.666 --> 01:32:52.800
THEY'VE GOT A LOOK AT THEM ONE

01:32:52.867 --> 01:32:57.805
BY ONE- IF A- IF THE OPPOSITION

01:32:57.872 --> 01:32:59.140
WANTS TO TALK ABOUT A MORE

01:32:59.206 --> 01:33:01.208
EFFECTIVE REGULATING REGIME WE

01:33:01.275 --> 01:33:03.477
COULD TALK ABOUT THAT. OF BUT

01:33:03.544 --> 01:33:05.980
RIGHT NOW WE DO SEE THE IMPACT

01:33:06.047 --> 01:33:08.015
OF THIS ON WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE

01:33:08.082 --> 01:33:11.686
BE USABLE GROUNDWATER SO WE'RE

01:33:11.752 --> 01:33:14.388
GOING TO TAKE THIS APPROACH IF

01:33:14.455 --> 01:33:17.024
THE OPPOSITION WANTS TO GET HELP

01:33:17.091 --> 01:33:18.192
TAKE ANOTHER APPROACH BUT THE

01:33:18.259 --> 01:33:19.226
CURRENT APPROACH ISN'T WORKING

01:33:19.293 --> 01:33:21.829
AT ALL AND I'D BE GLAD TO TALK

01:33:21.896 --> 01:33:23.531
WITH THE OPPOSITION ABOUT IT SO

01:33:23.597 --> 01:33:26.133
THANK YOU AND- ALWAYS FOR IS

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:29.570
THE- OKAY SO THE AMOUNT OF. OIL

01:33:29.637 --> 01:33:31.439
WERE TALKING ABOUT IS 1% OF

01:33:31.505 --> 01:33:34.108
CURRENT PRODUCTION PRODUCTION.

01:33:34.175 --> 01:33:37.244

01:33:37.311 --> 01:33:38.546
FREE INJECT THE WATER

01:33:38.612 --> 01:33:41.382
UNDERGROUND. AND THAT'S WHAT I

01:33:41.449 --> 01:33:43.017
WOULD EXPECT TO HAPPEN IF THIS

01:33:43.084 --> 01:33:44.618
BILL PASSES THAT INSTEAD OF

01:33:44.685 --> 01:33:45.920
PUTTING IT ONLINE PETS WORK

01:33:45.987 --> 01:33:48.222
CONTAMINATE THE WATER. IN THE

01:33:48.289 --> 01:33:50.324

01:33:50.391 --> 01:33:52.293
INJECTED UNDERGROUND WHICH IS

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:55.096
WHAT WE GET 98299% OF THE

01:33:55.162 --> 01:33:57.498
PRODUCTION. ALREADY DIED SO

01:33:57.565 --> 01:33:59.100
WE'RE JUST ASKING THEM TO DO

01:33:59.166 --> 01:34:00.601
WHAT THE OTHER PEOPLE DO

DIDN'T HEAR ANY WATER DISTRICTS

01:43:01.275 --> 01:43:04.044
IN SUPPORT OF THIS- IT SEEMS

01:43:04.111 --> 01:43:05.846
LIKE WE'VE GONE THROUGH THIS YOU

01:43:05.913 --> 01:43:08.048
KNOW IN THE LAST FORTY YEARS-

01:43:08.115 --> 01:43:10.284
HAVE AND HAVING ALL OF OUR

01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:11.051
PUBLIC AGENCIES AND SCHOOLS

01:43:11.118 --> 01:43:13.587
INCLUDING SCHOOLS SCALE DOWN

01:43:13.654 --> 01:43:16.356
THEIR USE OF WATER. AND A LOT OF

01:43:16.423 --> 01:43:19.092
THAT LED TO. YOU KNOW BASICALLY

01:43:19.159 --> 01:43:20.627
THE PLAYGROUNDS THAT WERE

01:43:20.694 --> 01:43:23.163
PAVEMENT INSTEAD OF GRASS IN THE

01:43:23.230 --> 01:43:24.197
GRASS DIDN'T LAST THAT LONG

01:43:24.264 --> 01:43:26.600
ANYWAY SO HOW DO YOU WORK WITH

01:43:26.667 --> 01:43:29.369
THE WATER DISTRICTS- TO NOT.

01:43:29.436 --> 01:43:31.104
IMPACT THE SCHOOLS FINANCIALLY

01:43:31.171 --> 01:43:33.040
BECAUSE THAT WAS A HUGE BILL

01:43:33.106 --> 01:43:35.142
THAT WAS ONE OF THE INCENTIVES

01:43:35.208 --> 01:43:36.176
FOR THEM NOT TO HAVE ANY MORE

01:43:36.243 --> 01:43:37.244
WAS BECAUSE WATER. KEPT

01:43:37.311 --> 01:43:38.912
ESCALATING IN AND AS LESS AND

01:43:38.979 --> 01:43:40.914
LESS WATER IS AVAILABLE TO BE

01:43:40.981 --> 01:43:44.117
ABLE TO- AT GROVE YOU KNOW AND

01:43:44.184 --> 01:43:48.455
URBAN FOREST- IT IT SEEMS LIKE

01:43:48.522 --> 01:43:51.291
IT MIGHT BE A WASTE OF TIME-

01:43:51.358 --> 01:43:52.326
BECAUSE WE KEEP GOING BACK AND

01:43:52.392 --> 01:43:54.728
FORTH. BETWEEN THE TWO- IT'S NOT

01:43:54.795 --> 01:43:57.097
A WASTE OF TIME TO YOU KNOW I

01:43:57.164 --> 01:43:58.432
OBVIOUSLY BE GREAT TO HAVE THESE

01:43:58.498 --> 01:44:00.867
FOR US BUT IT IT IT DOESN'T SEEM

01:44:00.934 --> 01:44:02.903
LIKE IT'S REALISTIC IN THE WORLD

01:44:02.970 --> 01:44:05.305
WE LIVE IN WITH THE WATER. AND

01:44:05.372 --> 01:44:07.341
AND THE EFFORT THAT HAS GONE ON

01:44:07.407 --> 01:44:09.443
FOR THE LAST FORTY YEARS TO GET

01:44:09.509 --> 01:44:11.278
AWAY FROM THAT USE OF WATER

01:44:11.345 --> 01:44:13.547
BECAUSE OF THE EXPENSE AND THE

01:44:13.614 --> 01:44:15.248
LACK OF THE RESOURCE ITSELF SO

01:44:15.315 --> 01:44:22.022
HOW DO YOU GUYS IN THAT INDUSTRY. DEAL WITH THAT PART OF IT. AT

01:44:22.089 --> 01:44:23.490

01:44:25.792 --> 01:44:26.426

01:44:35.068 --> 01:44:36.403
THINK SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS WELL

01:44:36.470 --> 01:44:38.271
AS NON PROFITS THAT ARE WORKING

01:44:38.338 --> 01:44:40.374

01:44:41.475 --> 01:44:43.243
IT IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:44.211

01:44:45.278 --> 01:44:46.480
FORESTRY PROGRAM AND URBAN

01:44:46.546 --> 01:44:48.181
GREENING THINGS LIKE-

01:44:48.248 --> 01:44:50.183
UTILIZATION OF BIO SWALES AND

01:44:50.250 --> 01:44:52.185
CISTERNS AS A WAY OF CAPTURING

WHENEVER THERE IS. A HEAVY

01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:55.322
DELUDE CAPTURING AS MUCH OF THAT

01:44:55.389 --> 01:44:57.624
STORMWATER ON SITE. TO BE ABLE

01:44:57.691 --> 01:44:59.693
TO USE IT WITHIN THE IRVING

01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:02.195
READING LANDSCAPE. IT IS A KEY

01:45:02.262 --> 01:45:03.430
COMPONENT SOMETHING THAT- I

01:45:03.497 --> 01:45:05.298
THINK A LOT OF THE PROJECT THAT

01:45:05.365 --> 01:45:06.466
WE'VE SEEN. HAVE- ALWAYS

01:45:06.533 --> 01:45:08.101
INCORPORATED AS A WAY OF

01:45:08.168 --> 01:45:09.236
ADDRESSING A PART OF THAT THE

01:45:09.302 --> 01:45:10.904
OTHER PART IS ADDRESSED BY-

01:45:10.971 --> 01:45:13.040
UTILIZATION OF. SOME BEST

01:45:13.106 --> 01:45:14.875
PRACTICES AROUND WHICH KINDS OF

01:45:14.941 --> 01:45:16.810
PLANTS WHICH KIND OF TREES ARE

01:45:16.877 --> 01:45:18.578
THE MOST APPROPRIATE ESPECIALLY

01:45:18.645 --> 01:45:20.013
AS OUR CLIMATE IS CHANGING.

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:21.915

SIMILAR ISSUES AROUND WATER

01:45:27.821 --> 01:45:29.990
SCARCITY AND HOW YOU PRIORITIZE-

01:45:30.057 --> 01:45:31.191
MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE. AND THEN

01:45:31.258 --> 01:45:33.093
I THINK AS WE'VE HEARD YOU KNOW

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.928
THAT THERE'S THAT THE BROADER

01:45:34.995 --> 01:45:36.396
IMPLICATION OF. HOW ARE WE GOING

01:45:36.463 --> 01:45:37.898

USES AND I THINK HERE YOU KNOW

01:45:40.967 --> 01:45:42.035
THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF

01:45:42.102 --> 01:45:46.807
BENEFITING STUDENTS IS ONE THAT.

01:45:46.873 --> 01:45:47.974

FEW YEARS AGO I WORKED ON A

01:46:03.256 --> 01:46:05.592
SIMILAR BILL- AND UNFORTUNATELY

01:46:05.659 --> 01:46:07.928
IT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR-

01:46:07.994 --> 01:46:09.463
AND I WANNA MAKE A FEW COMMENTS

01:46:09.529 --> 01:46:11.832

PRIORITY THIS YEAR WHICH IS

01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:20.941
SOMETHING THAT I'M VERY

01:46:21.007 --> 01:46:22.809
SUPPORTIVE OF- IN THE VETO

01:46:22.876 --> 01:46:25.812
MESSAGE OF MY BILL- THAT THE I

01:46:25.879 --> 01:46:27.380
WAS TOLD THAT THE STATE WAS

01:46:27.447 --> 01:46:29.216
ALREADY INVESTING IN AN OUTDOOR

01:46:29.282 --> 01:46:31.618
EQUITY GRANTS PROGRAM WHILE I AM

01:46:31.685 --> 01:46:33.320
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT GRANT

01:46:33.386 --> 01:46:36.156
PROGRAM. WHAT IT DOES IS TAKE

01:46:36.223 --> 01:46:37.858
STUDENTS THAT LIVE IN OUR

01:46:37.924 --> 01:46:39.960
COMMUNITIES- THAT SUFFER FROM

01:46:40.026 --> 01:46:42.062
EXTREME HATE TO HAVE VERY LITTLE

01:46:42.129 --> 01:46:45.532
GREEN SPACE TAKE THEM OUT ON A

01:46:45.599 --> 01:46:46.166
FIELD TRIP. YOU KNOW SOMEWHERE

01:46:46.233 --> 01:46:48.101
FAR AWAY FROM HOME WHICH IS I

01:46:48.168 --> 01:46:49.903
THINK A GREAT EXPERIENCE BUT

01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:51.671
IT'S NOT THE SAME AS HAVING

01:46:51.738 --> 01:46:53.607
ACCESS TO GREEN SPACE EVERY DAY

01:46:53.673 --> 01:46:56.543
IN YOUR COMMUNITY THIS IS LIKE A

01:46:56.610 --> 01:46:58.912
BASIC RIGHT YOU KNOW I GREW UP-

01:46:58.979 --> 01:47:01.181
ATTENDING LAUSD SCHOOLS WITH

01:47:01.248 --> 01:47:02.783
VERY LITTLE GREEN SPACE SO

01:47:02.849 --> 01:47:04.117
YOU'RE FORCED TO GO OUT AND PLAY

01:47:04.184 --> 01:47:06.219

THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION- AND SO

01:47:16.630 --> 01:47:18.799
I THINK THAT THIS IS WHY I THINK

01:47:18.865 --> 01:47:20.467

WITH PACIFIC FOREST TRUST.

01:57:33.045 --> 01:57:35.448
MORNING UP ON MASON WITH THE

01:57:35.515 --> 01:57:38.684
POOREST TRUST- THIS IS AN AREA

01:57:38.751 --> 01:57:40.186
OF POLICIES EVOLVING VERY VERY

01:57:40.253 --> 01:57:42.455
QUICKLY RIGHT NOW EXPECTED THE

01:57:42.522 --> 01:57:43.523
WORLD WILL LOOK DIFFERENT AFTER

SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT- THE

01:57:50.463 --> 01:57:52.398
AUTHOR HAD REFERENCE THERE. I

01:57:52.465 --> 01:57:55.067
THINK AT THE CORE IS HOW DO WE

01:57:55.134 --> 01:57:56.602
CONTINUE TO REALLY DRIVE TOWARDS

01:57:56.669 --> 01:57:57.870
HAVING MORE GOOD FIRE ON THE

01:57:57.937 --> 01:57:59.338
LANDSCAPE THE PERVERSE OUTCOME

01:57:59.405 --> 01:58:00.773
OF SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:58:00.840 --> 01:58:02.408
A YEAR ON FIRE SUPPRESSION IS

01:58:02.475 --> 01:58:04.076
WORTH LOOKING FOR THE MOST

01:58:04.143 --> 01:58:05.978
DAMAGING FIRES. AND SO WE REALLY

01:58:06.045 --> 01:58:08.281
NEED TO AS A STATE GET OUR HEAD

01:58:08.347 --> 01:58:09.949
AROUND HOW DO WE HAVE MORE FIRE

01:58:10.016 --> 01:58:11.584
THAT HAS THE SORT OF OUTCOMES ON

01:58:11.651 --> 01:58:14.120
THE LANDSCAPE THAT WE WANT. AND

01:58:14.187 --> 01:58:16.088
WE'RE THIS BILL CODIFIES THE

01:58:16.155 --> 01:58:18.057
TARGETS THAT- ARE IN THE

01:58:18.124 --> 01:58:19.459
RECENTLY RELEASED ACTION PLAN

01:58:19.525 --> 01:58:21.527
WHICH ARE MODEST BUT THEN SETS

01:58:21.594 --> 01:58:23.663
MORE ASPIRATIONAL TARGETS ON FOR

01:58:23.729 --> 01:58:26.532

TO A SMALL MOM AND POP TYPE OF

FACILITY OR COMPANY- IT THERE IS

02:23:46.250 --> 02:23:48.319
VERY LITTLE VALUE FORMER TALKING

ABOUT BIG COMPANIES AND WELL

02:23:50.288 --> 02:23:51.723
FUNDED VIOLATORS- IT'S REALLY

02:23:51.789 --> 02:23:53.591
JUST A SLAP ON THE WRIST REST AS

02:23:53.658 --> 02:23:55.493
THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER NOTED THE

02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:56.794
COST OF DOING BUSINESS- AND IT

02:23:56.861 --> 02:23:57.929
ALSO DOESN'T MATTER HOW

02:23:57.996 --> 02:23:59.497
EXTENSIVE THE AIR QUALITY

02:23:59.564 --> 02:24:02.467
VIOLATION IS SO- AS AS THE

02:24:02.533 --> 02:24:04.202
ASSEMBLY MEMBER- AS A MEMBER

02:24:04.268 --> 02:24:06.237
SANTIAGO SEES ME- DISCUSSED THE

02:24:06.304 --> 02:24:08.072
RENDERING FACILITIES SO THEY

TAKE RAW ANIMAL PARKS. AND THEY

02:24:10.508 --> 02:24:12.143
PROCESS THEM IT'S THE SMELL

02:24:12.210 --> 02:24:13.945
BASICALLY OF A ROTTING CORPSE

02:24:14.012 --> 02:24:16.180
SPREADING A CAR ACROSS NOT JUST

02:24:16.247 --> 02:24:17.415
ONE TOWN BUT IT ALMOST OF THE

02:24:17.482 --> 02:24:19.884
REGION- AND IT COULD IMPACT

02:24:19.951 --> 02:24:22.020
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND THAT'S

02:24:22.086 --> 02:24:23.755
JUST TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S

02:24:23.821 --> 02:24:25.356
IT NO MATTER THE SIZE OF IT AND

02:24:25.423 --> 02:24:28.893
SO- WE VIEW THAT AS AS BEING A

02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:31.029
SERIOUS PROBLEM- AND THIS BILL

02:24:31.095 --> 02:24:32.997

02:24:45.510 --> 02:24:47.078
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES- AND I

02:24:47.145 --> 02:24:48.179
THINK I WOULD BE REMISS WITHOUT

NOTING. THAT THIS BILL WILL NOT

02:24:50.014 --> 02:24:52.550

DETERMINING PENALTIES ONE OF

02:25:00.758 --> 02:25:02.160
THEM IS BASICALLY THE ABILITY TO

YOU ONLY GET TO THE SECOND PHASE

02:29:49.780 --> 02:29:50.915
OF THE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. IF

02:29:50.981 --> 02:29:52.550
YOU CAN'T SHOW THAT IT WAS

02:29:52.616 --> 02:29:54.051
SOMETHING BY- YOU KNOW HONEST

TYPICALLY AN EMISSIONS

02:29:58.155 --> 02:29:59.223
VIOLATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

02:29:59.290 --> 02:30:00.591
WHERE THERE'S A RELEASE OR

02:30:00.658 --> 02:30:02.259
SOMETHING FROM A FACILITY AND WE

02:30:02.326 --> 02:30:03.594
CAN MEASURE AND QUANTIFY THE

02:30:03.661 --> 02:30:05.229
EMISSIONS- WE WILL GO TO THE

02:30:05.296 --> 02:30:07.832
SECOND TIER OF THE- STRUCK

02:30:07.898 --> 02:30:09.000
LIABILITY WHICH WOULD BE IN THE

02:30:09.066 --> 02:30:10.301
TEN THOUSAND RANGE- BUT THAT'S

02:30:10.368 --> 02:30:11.736
THE MOST COMMON VIOLATION

02:30:11.802 --> 02:30:13.270
BECAUSE YOU KNOW BUSINESSES ARE

02:30:13.337 --> 02:30:14.972
NOT OUT THERE INTENTIONALLY.

02:30:15.039 --> 02:30:16.707
COMMITTING ENVIRONMENTAL CRIMES

02:30:16.774 --> 02:30:18.809
OR BY MIDDLE OF VIOLATIONS AND

02:30:18.876 --> 02:30:20.144
SO THAT'S WHY WE STICK UP OF THE

02:30:20.211 --> 02:30:22.012
BOTTOM LEVEL- YOU KNOW REASONS

02:30:22.079 --> 02:30:23.981
OF AND SUCH LIKE IN HYPERION-

02:30:24.048 --> 02:30:25.249
THEY HAD SOMETHING WHERE THERE

02:30:25.316 --> 02:30:27.284
WAS A AN OVERFLOW TO THE SYSTEM

02:30:27.351 --> 02:30:28.686
AND SO THAT RESULTED IN FORTY

02:30:28.753 --> 02:30:30.154
ONE DAYS. OF VIOLATION BUT IT

02:30:30.221 --> 02:30:31.856
WAS NOT SOMETHING WHERE THE

02:30:31.922 --> 02:30:34.191
OPERATOR INTENTIONALLY YOU KNOW

02:30:34.258 --> 02:30:34.992
WASN'T MAINTAINING THE SYSTEM OR

02:30:35.059 --> 02:30:36.093
SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SO

02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:38.329
THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

02:30:38.396 --> 02:30:39.196
SAMPLE LIKE THAT. FORTY ONE DAYS

02:30:39.263 --> 02:30:41.198
OF VIOLATION MAYBE YOU GET TEN

02:30:41.265 --> 02:30:42.633
THOUSAND DOLLARS WE DON'T FEEL

02:30:42.700 --> 02:30:44.001
THAT THAT'S REFLECTIVE OF THE

02:30:44.068 --> 02:30:47.271
TYPE OF IMPACT THAT WOULD HAVE

02:30:47.338 --> 02:30:48.105
LIKE ON THE NEARBY CITY LIKE

02:30:48.172 --> 02:30:51.342
ALSO. SO IF THERE WAS LIKE A- A

02:30:51.409 --> 02:30:54.278
SMALLER OPERATION LIKE. YOU KNOW

02:30:54.345 --> 02:30:58.215
NOT A REFINERY BUT- YOU KNOW

02:30:58.282 --> 02:30:59.950
THEY THEY THEY THEY WOULD BE

02:31:00.017 --> 02:31:02.853
POTENTIALLY HELD LIABLE FOR SOME

02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:04.088
OF THESE INCREASE STRICT

02:31:04.155 --> 02:31:06.390
LIABILITY PENALTIES KNOW WHAT OF

THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE THE

02:31:11.529 --> 02:31:12.430
LEGISLATURE IDENTIFIES EIGHT

02:31:12.496 --> 02:31:14.231
FACTORS AT ALL THE ARE DISTRICTS

02:31:14.298 --> 02:31:15.499
POSTED TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATIONS

TO PAY IS ONE OF THOSE FACTORS

02:31:21.105 --> 02:31:22.440
SO THAT'S ONE THAT- WHEN WE

02:31:22.506 --> 02:31:24.308
ENGAGE WITH NEGOTIATIONS WITH

02:31:24.375 --> 02:31:25.810

IT'S VERY UNLIKELY- THAT THIS

02:32:54.465 --> 02:32:56.267
