COMMERCIALIZED AND WHEN THOSE

00:39:00.204 --> 00:39:01.739
OCEAN CONDITIONS CHANGED AND WE

00:39:01.806 --> 00:39:03.374
LOST THE PRIMARY PREDATOR THE

ORIGINS MOVED IN AND I'VE

00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:08.312
CREATED BROAD BEHRENS THAT RUN

00:39:08.379 --> 00:39:10.214
FOR HUNDREDS OF MILES AND IT

00:39:10.281 --> 00:39:11.549
KILLED OFF OUR KELP FOREST.

00:43:49.493 --> 00:43:50.761
CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES

00:43:50.828 --> 00:43:53.897
ACT AS A GENETICALLY DISTINCT

00:43:53.964 --> 00:43:56.467
SUBSPECIES OF MOUNTAIN LION

00:43:56.533 --> 00:43:57.468
THAT WILL BE A SCIENCE BASED

00:43:57.534 --> 00:43:59.103
DECISION MAKING PROCESS BUT WE

00:43:59.169 --> 00:44:00.504
CAMPUS PRINCE PRESUME WHAT WILL

00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:02.439
HAPPEN THERE BUT IT IS BEING

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:05.109
CONSIDERED BY THE DEPARTMENT OR

00:44:05.175 --> 00:44:06.076
THE CAT FOOD FISHING GAME

00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:11.315
COMMISSION. THIS SPRING. BUT

00:44:11.382 --> 00:44:13.517
ALSO IN TO FOCUS ON THREE AREAS

00:44:13.584 --> 00:44:15.085
OUT OF NOT LIONS AND CALIFORNIA

00:44:15.152 --> 00:44:16.186
THAT FIRST DEAF. PERMITS AND

00:44:16.253 --> 00:44:16.820
BEEN WORKING CLOSELY THE RECTOR

00:44:16.887 --> 00:44:19.123
BONHAM TO REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW

00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:20.657
DEPREDATION PERMITS WHICH IS

00:44:20.724 --> 00:44:22.092
THE PERMISSION TO KILL A

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:23.861
PREDATOR THAT'S- KILLING

00:44:23.927 --> 00:44:25.629
LIVESTOCK ETCETERA. HOW THOSE

00:44:25.696 --> 00:44:27.698
ARE TRULY THE LAST RESORT AND

00:44:27.765 --> 00:44:30.734
HOW WE AS A STATE CAN DO MORE.

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:33.037
TO AVOID THAT THE NEED TO ISSUE

00:44:33.103 --> 00:44:34.038
THOSE DEPREDATION PERMITS

00:44:34.104 --> 00:44:35.305
NUMBER ONE THE SECOND IS

00:44:35.372 --> 00:44:36.940
RODENTICIDE WHICH IS AN ISSUE

00:44:37.007 --> 00:44:39.043
YOU'VE LET ON I WHICH IS A LOT

00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:40.544
OF OUR HOUSEHOLD- POISONS TO

00:44:40.611 --> 00:44:42.579
KILL OFF ROUTE THAT CETERA. ARE

00:44:42.646 --> 00:44:44.381
FINDING THEIR WAY INTO THE FOOD

00:44:44.448 --> 00:44:46.517
SOURCES OF THESE OP OF THESE

00:44:46.583 --> 00:44:48.018
MOUNTAIN LIONS AND SO OBVIOUSLY

00:44:48.085 --> 00:44:49.720
WE COULD TALK MORE ABOUT WHAT

00:44:49.787 --> 00:44:50.254
NEEDS TO HAPPEN BUT IT'S

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.856
PARTNERING- ARE- AGENCIES WITH

00:44:52.923 --> 00:44:54.892
YOUR LEADERSHIP TO ACTUALLY.

00:44:54.958 --> 00:44:56.326
REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF IDENTIFIED

00:44:56.393 --> 00:44:57.895
THAT GET IN THE WILD POPULATION

00:44:57.961 --> 00:45:00.631
AND THEN THE THIRD. IS TRAFFIC

00:45:00.697 --> 00:45:02.800
A MAJOR- MORTALITY THREAT FOR

00:45:02.866 --> 00:45:04.234
THESE MOUNTAIN LIONS IS HIGHWAY

00:45:04.301 --> 00:45:06.136
ONE A NE WE'RE REALLY EXCITED

00:45:06.203 --> 00:45:07.871
WITH THIS OVER PASS THAT'S

00:45:07.938 --> 00:45:09.840
BEING CONSTRUCTED OVER HIGHWAY

00:45:09.907 --> 00:45:10.941
ONE A ONE WHICH WILL PROVIDE

00:45:11.008 --> 00:45:12.476
RECREATIONAL ACCESS BUT ALSO

00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:14.311
LINK THAT TO HABITATS OF THESE

00:45:14.378 --> 00:45:16.080
MOUNTAIN LION POPULATIONS. BUT

00:45:16.146 --> 00:45:17.981
CHAIR WEEK WE CAN DO MORE TO

00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:21.518
ACTUALLY PROTECT- THE LAND ARE

00:45:21.585 --> 00:45:23.353
JOINING OR THAT'S CONNECTED BY

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.489
THAT OVER PASS I'M SO THERE MAY

00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:27.925
BE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXT AND-

00:45:27.991 --> 00:45:30.527
OUR OUR OUR- NATURE PRESERVES-

00:45:30.594 --> 00:45:34.798
IN. THAT SORT OF NORTH. AREA OF

00:45:34.865 --> 00:45:36.300
THIS ABOUT A IN ORDER TO.

00:45:36.366 --> 00:45:37.801
REALLY IN THAT. CROSSING TO

THAT IT'S BEING CONSTRUCTED

00:45:47.911 --> 00:45:49.613
WELL IT'S NOT QUITE UNDER

00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.048
CONSTRUCTION SORRY BUT IF THE

00:45:51.115 --> 00:45:52.950
PLANET THAT OPTIMISM WILL HELP

HAPPEN AND HE ACTUALLY. THE

00:46:03.293 --> 00:46:04.628
SITE LAST YEAR AND THIS HAS

00:46:04.695 --> 00:46:05.629
BEEN A PARTNERSHIP OF THE STATE

00:46:05.696 --> 00:46:06.830
WITH PHILANTHROPIC LEADERS AND

00:46:06.897 --> 00:46:08.866
I KNOW THE ONE AREA OF FOCUS IS

00:46:08.932 --> 00:46:10.100
REALLY ENSURING THAT WE CAN GET

00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:12.102
THAT PHILANTHROPIC MATCH- BUT

GOOD WORK TOGETHER ON ALL OF

00:46:19.576 --> 00:46:21.078
THE OF THE BULLET POINTS THAT

00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:23.213
YOU'VE IDENTIFIED FOR US AND

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.382
LET ME CALL NOW ON MISTER FUNK

THE HUNDRED TWENTY NEW

00:46:52.809 --> 00:46:54.044
POSITIONS THAT YOU. THAT YOU'RE

00:46:54.111 --> 00:46:55.712
REQUESTING A THAT DID. RICK A

00:46:55.779 --> 00:46:58.248
YOU. WE HAD X. COVER. ABOUT THE

00:46:58.315 --> 00:47:00.817
PERMIT BACK THAT IS A- THAT. I

00:47:00.884 --> 00:47:02.486
BELIEVE IS STIFLING. THE OF

00:47:02.553 --> 00:47:04.087
ENERGY BUT- AND OUR STATE. DO

00:47:04.154 --> 00:47:06.790
ANY OF A- THE HARD WAY NEW

00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:07.991
POSITION. DO OF IT ADDRESS THE

00:47:08.058 --> 00:47:12.229
BACK. THE GOOD. LET ME ANSWER

00:47:12.296 --> 00:47:12.796
DIRECTLY LET ME JUST GIVE A

00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:13.630
LITTLE CON. WE IS THAT YOU

00:47:13.697 --> 00:47:15.499
WE'VE BEEN. WE'VE BEEN CLEAR

00:47:15.566 --> 00:47:18.168
THAT. AS WE IMPROVE REGULATORY

00:47:18.235 --> 00:47:20.637
OVERSIGHT WE NEED TO PROVIDE

00:47:20.704 --> 00:47:22.639
SORT OF FULL AND FAIR OVERSIGHT

00:47:22.706 --> 00:47:25.409
WHICH MEANS HAVING A CLEAR

00:47:25.475 --> 00:47:26.677
LINES OF COMMUNICATION WITH

00:47:26.743 --> 00:47:28.612
INDUSTRY OPERATORS- WHICH WE

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:32.149
DO- AND WE LEARN FROM INDUSTRY

00:47:32.216 --> 00:47:33.884
OPERATORS THAT THEY REALLY.

00:47:33.951 --> 00:47:35.953
DESIRE TWO THINGS- ONE IS

00:47:36.019 --> 00:47:38.555
CLARITY ON THE RULES THAT

00:47:38.622 --> 00:47:39.823
GOVERN THEIR OPERATIONS AND THE

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:42.492
SECOND IS CERTAINTY- AS

00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:44.094
BUSINESSES THEY NEED TO PLAN

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:46.363
AND REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND-

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:47.898
WHAT IT YOU KNOW WHAT TIME

00:47:47.965 --> 00:47:49.833
LINES ARE REQUIRED IN

00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:51.068
PERMITTING AN OVERSIGHT. SO

00:47:51.134 --> 00:47:52.703
WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO ONE BE

00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:54.838
VERY CLEAR- AROUND THE

00:47:54.905 --> 00:47:56.240
OVERSIGHT WE NEED TO PROVIDE

00:47:56.306 --> 00:47:58.175
AND THEN TO BUILD CERTAINTY SO

00:47:58.242 --> 00:47:59.409
THAT AT LEAST THERE'S AN

00:47:59.476 --> 00:48:01.545
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S WHAT'S

00:48:01.612 --> 00:48:03.413
HAPPENED. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:04.581
AREAS ARE COUPLE TYPES OF

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:06.383
PERMITS- THAT HAVE SLOWED DOWN

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:09.019
RECENTLY. ONE IS HYDRAULIC

00:48:09.086 --> 00:48:11.154
FRACTURING PERMITS- AND THE

00:48:11.221 --> 00:48:12.956
OTHER IS PERMITS RELATED TO A

00:48:13.023 --> 00:48:15.058
PRACTICE CALLED I HIGH PRESSURE

00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:18.128
STEAM INJECTIONS. EACH HAS A

00:48:18.195 --> 00:48:20.464
DIFFERENT REASON FOR BEING- FOR

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:21.798
SLOWING DOWN- THE FIRST

00:48:21.865 --> 00:48:24.234
HYDRAULIC FRACTURING. ARE

00:48:24.301 --> 00:48:25.869
UNDERGOING PERMIT BY PERMIT

00:48:25.936 --> 00:48:27.871
REVIEWS BY AN INDEPENDENT-

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:28.839
OUTSIDE ENTITY LAWRENCE

00:48:28.905 --> 00:48:31.608
LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABS WHILE-

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:33.610
THE THAT PERMITTING PROCESS-

00:48:33.677 --> 00:48:35.579
RECEIVES AN AUDIT FROM THE

00:48:35.646 --> 00:48:36.446
OFFICE OF STATE AUDITS AND

00:48:36.513 --> 00:48:38.682
EVALUATIONS. THIS WAS IN

00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:39.950
RESPONSE TO CONCERNS LAST

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:41.652
SUMMER ABOUT- CAL GEMS

00:48:41.718 --> 00:48:43.186
PERMITTING PROCESS FROM WHERE

00:48:43.253 --> 00:48:44.688
WE SET WE NEED TO BUILD PUBLIC

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:46.023
CONFIDENCE OF THAT THE

00:48:46.089 --> 00:48:47.724
PERMITTING PROCESS THAT CAL JAM

00:48:47.791 --> 00:48:50.394
HAS IN PLACE. IS FULLY

00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:53.497
ADEQUATE- TOWARD PROTECTING-

00:48:53.563 --> 00:48:55.265
YOU DON'T ALL THAT WE NEED TO

00:48:55.332 --> 00:48:56.800
PROTECT WHEN GIVING A PERMIT.

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:57.968
THE SECOND IS- THAT OTHER

00:48:58.035 --> 00:49:00.003
PRACTICEHIGH PRESSURE STEAM

00:49:00.070 --> 00:49:04.074
INJECTIONS. AND THAT. WE WILL

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:05.375
CONTINUE WAS RAISED ABOUT THE

00:49:05.442 --> 00:49:06.943
SO CALLED SURFACE EXPRESSION

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:07.944
FOR THESE OIL LEAKS AT THE

00:49:08.011 --> 00:49:09.579
SURFACE OVER THE SUMMER AND THE

00:49:09.646 --> 00:49:10.747
CORRELATION BETWEEN THAT

00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:12.716
PRACTICE AND THOSE OIL LEAKS.

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:15.619
SO WHAT WE WHAT WE ARE CALTRAIN

00:49:15.686 --> 00:49:17.521
ANNOUNCED IN NOVEMBER WAS-

00:49:17.587 --> 00:49:18.822
PLACING A MORATORIUM

00:49:18.889 --> 00:49:20.991
SPECIFICALLY ON THAT PRACTICE

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:22.859
UNTIL A STUDY IS COMPLETED TO

00:49:22.926 --> 00:49:23.860
REALLY UNDERSTAND THE

00:49:23.927 --> 00:49:25.262
CORRELATION OF THAT PRACTICE TO

00:49:25.329 --> 00:49:27.197
BE SURFACE EXPRESSIONS. SO IN

00:49:27.264 --> 00:49:28.699
CASES THAT'S BEEN A POINT

00:49:28.765 --> 00:49:29.866
STRAIGHT XIN FOR THE INDUSTRY

00:49:29.933 --> 00:49:31.935
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT SEEING

00:49:32.002 --> 00:49:34.237
PERMITS COME THROUGH. AND WE'VE

00:49:34.304 --> 00:49:35.238
BEEN VERY CLEAR WITH THEM THAT

00:49:35.305 --> 00:49:36.873
THIS INDEPENDENT REVIEW IS

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.942
TAKING PLACE AND WE DO

00:49:39.009 --> 00:49:39.876
ANTICIPATE IT ACTUALLY MOVING

00:49:39.943 --> 00:49:42.612
FORWARD AND ENABLING PERMITS TO

00:49:42.679 --> 00:49:44.848
BE ISSUED- AS IT RELATES TO THE

00:49:44.915 --> 00:49:46.016
HYDRAULIC FRACTURING AND THEN

00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:48.985
AS IT RELATES TO THE MORATORIUM

00:49:49.052 --> 00:49:49.486
THE HIGH PRESSURE STEAM

00:49:49.553 --> 00:49:53.056
PRACTICE- WE NEED TO ENSURE

00:49:53.123 --> 00:49:54.358
THAT LAWRENCE LIVERMORE. AND

00:49:54.424 --> 00:49:56.159
CAL JIM CAN ACTUALLY PARTNER ON

00:49:56.226 --> 00:49:58.061
THAT STUDY WHICH WE ANTICIPATE

00:49:58.128 --> 00:50:02.099
pIN THAT THAT STUDY IS POISED TO

00:50:02.165 --> 00:50:03.400
BEGIN WITH AND APART THE

00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:05.335
FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY

00:50:05.402 --> 00:50:07.070
APPROVED A CONTRACT FOR

00:50:07.137 --> 00:50:08.472
LAWRENCE LIVERMORE. I'M IN SO

00:50:08.538 --> 00:50:11.608
WE ANTICIPATE THAT CONTRACT TO

00:50:11.675 --> 00:50:14.311
BE. PROVED ANY DATE NOW. SO IN

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:15.412
DIRECT ANSWER TO QUESTION THESE

00:50:15.479 --> 00:50:16.279
ARE ONE AND TWENTY EIGHT

00:50:16.346 --> 00:50:18.982
POSITIONS DON'T FOCUS ON YEAH I

00:50:19.049 --> 00:50:22.119
INCREASING SPEED OF PERMITTING

00:50:22.185 --> 00:50:24.888
THEY- FOCUS ON ONE HAVING OUT

00:50:24.955 --> 00:50:26.556
MORE INSPECTORS IN THE FIELD TO

00:50:26.623 --> 00:50:29.726
WIN. YES ACTIVITY WITH THE OF

00:50:29.793 --> 00:50:31.661
INDUSTRY OPERATORS RIGHT NOW

00:50:31.728 --> 00:50:33.063
ARE WITNESSING RATES ARE LOWER

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:35.532
THAN THEY NEED TO BE- I THINK

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:36.032
YOU'LL IT WHEN YOU ASKED

00:50:36.099 --> 00:50:37.167
INDUSTRY OPERATORS THEY'LL TELL

00:50:37.234 --> 00:50:39.770
YOU THAT IT'S ACTUALLY. CAN BE

00:50:39.836 --> 00:50:40.337
CONSTRUCTIVE AND HELPFUL TO

00:50:40.404 --> 00:50:42.406
HAVE. A CAL JIM EMPLOYEE WITH

00:50:42.472 --> 00:50:44.741
THEM- TOO AGAIN SOME EYES

00:50:44.808 --> 00:50:46.543

00:57:27.310 --> 00:57:31.548
REALLY LACKED THAT ACCESS- TO

00:57:31.614 --> 00:57:32.115
HELP SORT OF BRING NATURE TO

00:57:32.182 --> 00:57:36.586
COMMUNITIES TO. CERTAINLY

00:57:36.653 --> 00:57:41.558
MISTER PATTERSON. ARE YOU ARE

YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE-

00:57:44.260 --> 00:57:44.694
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

00:57:44.761 --> 00:57:47.664
BERKELEY- ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF

00:57:47.730 --> 00:57:48.598
THE WATER POLICY THE STATE OF

00:57:48.665 --> 00:57:49.899
CALIFORNIA AND ITS EFFECT ON

00:57:49.966 --> 00:57:51.768
CENTRAL CALIFORNIA I SURE AM

00:57:51.835 --> 00:57:54.737
AND THAT KIND OF MIST- WAS ABLE

00:57:54.804 --> 00:57:55.972
TO BRIEF MYSELF AND GOVERNOR

00:57:56.039 --> 00:57:57.774
NEW SOME AND THAT AND A HIGH

00:57:57.841 --> 00:58:00.977
LEVEL CABINET GROUP- UP. ON THE

00:58:01.044 --> 00:58:05.114
STUDY ABOUT A MONTH AGO. HOW

00:58:05.181 --> 00:58:06.749
WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THE

00:58:06.816 --> 00:58:09.285
RESULT OF THAT STUDY. I'M

00:58:09.352 --> 00:58:10.453
LOOKING FOR AN ADJECTIVE HERE

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:17.894
YEAH. WELL I WOULD SAY. I'M I'M

00:58:17.961 --> 00:58:20.063
TRYING TO HONOR YOUR REQUEST

FOR ONE ADDITIVE. HOW BOUT

00:58:22.599 --> 00:58:25.602
CATASTROPHIC. THAT COULD BE ONE

00:58:25.668 --> 00:58:28.371
I WOULD SAY TROUBLING- AND I'LL

00:58:28.438 --> 00:58:31.574
TELL YOU WHY SO. WE UNDERSTAND

00:58:31.641 --> 00:58:36.913
THAT- WATER RELIABILITY IS ALL

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:37.947
IT IS THE LIFE BLOOD THE

00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:40.149
AGRICULTURE AND AGRICULTURE IS

00:58:40.216 --> 00:58:40.984
THE LIFEBLOOD OF THE CENTRAL

00:58:41.050 --> 00:58:44.787
VALLEY SO THEREFORE- WATER

00:58:44.854 --> 00:58:46.522
SUPPLY WATER RELIABILITY IS

00:58:46.589 --> 00:58:48.291
CRITICAL THE ECONOMIC VITALITY

00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:50.226
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND MY

00:58:50.293 --> 00:58:52.228
INTERPRETATION OF THAT STUDY IS

00:58:52.295 --> 00:58:54.697
IT IDENTIFIED- SIGNIFICANT

00:58:54.764 --> 00:58:57.333
IMPACTS- TO THAT WATER SUPPLY-

00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:59.736
BOTH PRESENT AND- AND SORT OF

00:58:59.802 --> 00:59:02.338
POTENTIAL IN THE FUTURE- WHICH

00:59:02.405 --> 00:59:03.072
ONE WOULD YOU AGREE THAT THOSE

00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:05.742
ARE POLICY. CONSEQUENCES IN

00:59:05.808 --> 00:59:07.210
OTHER WORDS PEOPLE ARE MAKING

00:59:07.277 --> 00:59:08.544
THE DECISIONS THAT ARE

00:59:08.611 --> 00:59:11.281
CREATING. THE PROBLEM. ARM WELL

00:59:11.347 --> 00:59:12.248
I WOULD SAY THAT THOSE

00:59:12.315 --> 00:59:15.318
DECISIONS STARTED YOU KNOW IN

00:59:15.385 --> 00:59:17.854
YOU KNOW. WHAT LOOK I DON'T I'M

00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:20.290
NOT GOOD. I WOULD SAY THAT WELL

00:59:20.356 --> 00:59:23.326
PART OF. WHAT IS DRIVING THOUGH

00:59:23.393 --> 00:59:25.228
IT THAT IMPACT HAS BEEN THE

00:59:25.295 --> 00:59:26.296
DECADE- DEPLETION OF OUR

00:59:26.362 --> 00:59:28.064
GROUNDWATER AQUIFERS AND THE

00:59:28.131 --> 00:59:29.132
BROAD NEED THAT WE ALL

00:59:29.198 --> 00:59:30.199
RECOGNIZE TO BRING THOSE

00:59:30.266 --> 00:59:32.368
AQUIFERS BACK INTO BALANCE. I

00:59:32.435 --> 00:59:34.137
THINK- EVERYONE FROM

00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:36.105
CONGRESSMAN COST ON DOWN HAS

00:59:36.172 --> 00:59:38.074
HAS INDICATED THAT.

00:59:38.141 --> 00:59:39.709
IMPLEMENTING SIGMA IS

00:59:39.776 --> 00:59:41.177
ULTIMATELY IMPORTANT TO

00:59:41.244 --> 00:59:42.645
SECURING THOSE WATER SUPPLIES

00:59:42.712 --> 00:59:43.713
FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:46.249
FARMERS AND WE NEED TO DO THAT.

00:59:46.316 --> 00:59:48.785
BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT THAT HAS

00:59:48.851 --> 00:59:51.087
REAL ECONOMIC IMPACT INCLUDING-

00:59:51.154 --> 00:59:53.656
FOLLOWING- IN IN LITTLE

00:59:53.723 --> 00:59:54.757
PORTIONS OF THE SAN JOAQUIN

00:59:54.824 --> 00:59:57.393
VALLEY. AND IT'S WHY- THE STATE

00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:59.762
HAS INVESTED AT THIS POINT

00:59:59.829 --> 01:00:01.331
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:00:01.397 --> 01:00:02.065
INTO SUPPORTING LOCAL

01:00:02.131 --> 01:00:03.566
COMMUNITIES BUILDING THEIR OWN

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:05.134
PLANS TO MANAGE THOSE

01:00:05.201 --> 01:00:06.869
GROUNDWATER BASINS. OB AND THEN

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:07.804
SUPPORTING IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:09.806
THOSE PLANS IT'S WHY WE

01:00:09.872 --> 01:00:11.607
RECOMMEND SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:00:11.674 --> 01:00:13.109
A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND INTO

01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:15.111
THIS BUDGET THAT CAN GET BACK

01:00:15.178 --> 01:00:16.346
INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES VERY

01:00:16.412 --> 01:00:17.814
QUICKLY TO IMPLEMENT CIGNA.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.749
ALSO I RECOMMEND THAT FOUR

01:00:19.816 --> 01:00:20.516
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN A

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:23.419
NOVEMBER OBLIGATION BOND

01:00:23.486 --> 01:00:25.822
DEDICATED TO SEGMENT

01:00:25.888 --> 01:00:26.556
IMPLEMENTATION GET INTO

01:00:26.622 --> 01:00:29.559
COMMUNITY. SO NUMBER ONE IS

01:00:29.625 --> 01:00:30.994
ABSOLUTELY THAT THE- BRINGING

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:31.728
GROUND WATER BASE THEN THE

01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:35.832
BALANCE WILL HAVE YOU CAN MAKE.

01:00:35.898 --> 01:00:39.736
IT IMPACTS. AND YET THAT WAS A

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:41.270
POLICY DECISION ALL I THINK

01:00:41.337 --> 01:00:43.373
APOLLO DECISION THAT EVERYONE

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:45.241
RECOGNIZES. WHICH IS TOP WATER

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:46.642
FOR SENT COMMUNITY FOR DECADES

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:49.912
TO COME. SEC AREA OF. COPPER

01:00:49.979 --> 01:00:52.048
THAT IS IN IS THAT LEAST AS

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:53.149
WITH WHAT WHY. AND HOW DO WE

01:00:53.216 --> 01:00:54.283
BALANCE. THE NEED TO OF THE

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:55.251
EXTINCTION OF OUR SAN AND WHY

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:56.919
MAX. WATER SUPPLY REAL

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:58.121
RELIABILITY FOR THE CENTRAL

01:00:58.187 --> 01:01:00.056
VALLEY. AND THAT'S WHY ARE OUR

01:01:00.123 --> 01:01:01.624
ADMINISTRATION HAS INVESTED A

01:01:01.691 --> 01:01:02.925
LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY IN THE

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:04.494
LAST YEAR ON DEVELOPING THE SO

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.362
CALLED VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS.

01:01:06.429 --> 01:01:07.630
THAT MEET STATE AND FEDERAL

01:01:07.697 --> 01:01:09.165
LAWS TO IMPROVE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:01:09.232 --> 01:01:11.434
CONDITIONS TO ALLOW THOSE FISH

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.202
TO SURVIVE BUT IN WAYS THAT

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:14.570
ACTUALLY WORK WITH WATER

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.439
AGENCIES- IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.241
AND OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE.

01:01:18.307 --> 01:01:21.110
TO REDUCE UNCERTAINTY OF WATER

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:23.413
SUPPLY. SO I CAN TELL YOU THAT

01:01:23.479 --> 01:01:27.850
pANXIETY AND THE CONCERN ABOUT

01:01:27.917 --> 01:01:29.419
THE WATER SUPPLY RELY

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:31.254
ABILITIES- ISSUE COULD YOU KNOW

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:33.189
IT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND

01:01:33.256 --> 01:01:35.091
I'M FOCUSED MYSELF PERSONALLY

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:36.559
THROUGH THE JOB ON TRYING TO

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:38.628
REDUCE THAT THAT WATER BY

01:01:38.694 --> 01:01:41.697
RELIABILITY. WE HAVE TO BALANCE

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:42.765
AND GOVERNOR NEWS HIMSELF HAS

01:01:42.832 --> 01:01:44.333
BEEN VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE NEED

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.469
BALLOT. OUR WATER SUPPLY I

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:49.405
POLICY NOT LEAVE CENTRAL VALLEY

01:01:49.472 --> 01:01:55.678
BEHIND. I'M. YOU MUST OF READ A

01:01:55.745 --> 01:01:59.282
DIFFERENT REPORT THAN I DID.

01:01:59.348 --> 01:02:02.018
THE BASIC FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:04.620
HERE IS BASED ON WHAT CAN ONLY

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:06.155
BE DESCRIBED AS A SCHIZOPHRENIC

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.623
POLICY ON THE ONE HAND THE

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:10.226
STATE IS SAYING IF YOU PUMP THE

01:02:10.293 --> 01:02:10.827
WATER OUT YOU'VE GOT TO PUT IT

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:14.063
BACK. AND OUT OF THE OTHER.

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:15.131
SIDE OF THEIR MOUTH THEY'RE

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:16.933
SAYING WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE

01:02:16.999 --> 01:02:18.167
SUBSTANTIALLY AND SIGNIFICANTLY

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:19.802
THE SURFACE WATER THAT IS

01:02:19.869 --> 01:02:22.705
NECESSARY. TO PUT THE WATER

01:02:22.772 --> 01:02:24.240
BACK IN THE UNDERGROUND AT

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:25.741
THAT'S NUMBER ONE THAT'S THE

01:02:25.808 --> 01:02:29.445
FUNDAMENTAL CORE POLICY THAT AS

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:31.581
ANALYSIS AT AT THE HEART OF

01:02:31.647 --> 01:02:35.051
THIS THAT. THE IDEA THAT YOU'VE

01:02:35.118 --> 01:02:37.587
GOT TO PUT THE WATER BACK BUT

01:02:37.653 --> 01:02:38.154
WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU

01:02:38.221 --> 01:02:39.255
ENOUGH WATER TO PUT IT BACK.

01:02:39.322 --> 01:02:40.923
ARE ARE YOU NOT CONCERNED THAT

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:43.893
THE CONCLUSIONS OF THIS FROM

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:44.460
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:46.896
BERKELEY. THAT A MILLION ACRE

01:02:46.963 --> 01:02:49.065
FEET WILL FALLOW. THAT

01:02:49.132 --> 01:02:51.434
SOMETHING LIKE SIXTY FIVE

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:52.835
THOUSAND JOBS WILL DISAPPEAR

01:02:52.902 --> 01:02:54.036
SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF

01:02:54.103 --> 01:02:58.341
CROP VALUE. HALF HALF A BILLION

01:02:58.407 --> 01:03:00.309
DOLLARS WORTH OF LOST TAX

01:03:00.376 --> 01:03:02.311
REVENUE THAT THERE'S A REAL

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:05.414
POTENTIAL FOR THE- AND

01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:07.650
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN CERTAIN

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:09.318
AREAS OF THE OF OUR- CENTRAL

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:12.622
CALIFORNIA. TO DOUBLE AND WITH

01:03:12.688 --> 01:03:16.726
RESPECT TO THE. IN OTHER

01:03:16.792 --> 01:03:18.861
COMMUNITIES THE AND THE

01:03:18.928 --> 01:03:20.730

MOST I'M SURE YOU SAW THAT THIS

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:28.938
IS A HIGHLY REGRESSIVE.

01:03:29.005 --> 01:03:30.706
CONSEQUENCE IN OTHER WORDS THE

01:03:30.773 --> 01:03:33.109
POOR ARE HURT MORE THAN ANYBODY

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:36.345
ELSE. AND THAT THE COMMUNITIES

01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:38.147
THE PLACES THAT THESE ARE HURT

THE MOST ARE THOSE WHO NEED THE

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:42.852
CLEAN WATER WHO NEED THE FLOWS

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:44.153
TO GET. INTO THE UNDERGROUND

01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:50.493
RIGHT. LOOK WE ALL UNDERSTAND

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.094
THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME

01:03:52.161 --> 01:03:55.364

CATASTROPHIC. WE'VE GOT TO HAVE

01:04:04.707 --> 01:04:07.710
THE GOVERNOR ENGAGED. AND HE'S

01:04:07.777 --> 01:04:09.912

LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

01:17:47.996 --> 01:17:49.498
AND IT'S SO IN REVIEWING THE

01:17:49.564 --> 01:17:51.700
PROPOSAL AND WE DO FIND THAT

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:54.136
THAT CONCEPT OF- COLLECTING

01:17:54.202 --> 01:17:56.605
LIDAR DATA ON THE STATE ON

01:17:56.671 --> 01:17:58.840
APPEARS POMISING- AS AND THAT

01:17:58.907 --> 01:18:00.308
THE AGENCY REPRESENTATIVES HAVE

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:02.577
TESTIFIED. AND THERE'S A LOT OF

01:18:02.644 --> 01:18:04.279
POTENTIAL AND IT REALLY

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:06.214
INTERESTING AND INNOVATIVE

01:18:06.281 --> 01:18:09.518
USES- OF FOR THIS DATA AND

01:18:09.584 --> 01:18:12.354
HOWEVER AND WE RAISED SOME

01:18:12.421 --> 01:18:13.922
CONCERNS THAT THE PROPOSAL

01:18:13.989 --> 01:18:16.491
MIGHT BE PREMATURE AND IS SO AS

01:18:16.558 --> 01:18:18.293
WAS TESTIFIED TO PREVIOUSLY

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.795
THERE IS A WORKING GROUP THAT

01:18:19.861 --> 01:18:22.064
THAT AGENCY IS DEVELOPING. ON

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:23.732
TO LOOK AT EXACTLY HOW THE DATA

01:18:23.799 --> 01:18:25.434
WOULD BE HUGHES WE FEEL THAT

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.502
INFORMATION IS ACTUALLY REALLY

01:18:27.569 --> 01:18:29.171
NECESSARY BEFORE THE

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:30.772
LEGISLATURE MOVES FORWARD IT

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:32.340
WITH ACTUALLY APPROVING A

01:18:32.407 --> 01:18:34.309
SPENDING EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:35.610
FOR A ONE TIME DATA COLLECTION

01:18:35.677 --> 01:18:39.014
AND IS SORT OF A HIGH COST. AND

01:18:39.081 --> 01:18:40.882
IT'S SORT OF UNCLEAR AT THIS

01:18:40.949 --> 01:18:43.285
POINT EXACTLY HOW THE VARIOUS

01:18:43.351 --> 01:18:44.619
DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE OR

01:18:44.686 --> 01:18:46.421
LOCAL PARTNERS OR JUST MEMBERS

01:18:46.488 --> 01:18:47.956
OF THE PUBLIC COULD HAVE ACCESS

01:18:48.023 --> 01:18:49.424
TO THIS DATA WOULD REALLY

01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:52.394
UTILIZE. ON THIS COULD REQUIRES

01:18:52.461 --> 01:18:54.029
CERTAIN PROGRAMMATIC SHIFT

01:18:54.096 --> 01:18:56.598
CHANGES WITHIN VARIOUS STATE

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:57.966
DEPARTMENTS. IN TERMS OF HOW

01:18:58.033 --> 01:19:00.302
THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO AND

01:19:00.368 --> 01:19:02.971
TAKE THE DATE AND CHANGE THE

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:05.140
WAY THEY MAKE DECISIONS ON. FOR

01:19:05.207 --> 01:19:06.508
EXAMPLE WHICH EXPENSE WE FIND

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:08.877
FOR FOREST HEALTH PROJECTS- OR

01:19:08.944 --> 01:19:09.778
HOW THEY'RE MAKING CERTAIN

01:19:09.845 --> 01:19:12.347
PLANNING DECISIONS ON FOR

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:14.416
FUTURE PROJECTS AND SO WITHOUT

01:19:14.483 --> 01:19:15.851
HAVING A GOOD IMPLEMENTATION

01:19:15.917 --> 01:19:18.153
STRATEGY WE FEEL THAT THEPROPOSAL'S PRETEND POTENTIALLY

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:20.555
PREMATURE. GIVEN THE HIGH COST

01:19:20.622 --> 01:19:22.524
I THINK AND IT WAS TESTIFIED TO

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:23.859
THAT U. S. G. S. TYPICALLY

01:19:23.925 --> 01:19:25.994
LIKES TO SEE AN EIGHT YEAR

01:19:26.061 --> 01:19:30.866
CYCLE OF RE COLLECTING THE DATA

01:19:30.932 --> 01:19:31.399
IN OUR DISCUSSION WITH THE

01:19:31.466 --> 01:19:32.367
AGENCY IT SOUND LIKE. THIS

01:19:32.434 --> 01:19:33.635
INITIAL PASSIVE DATA WILL TAKE

01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:35.504
THE FIVE. SO BY THE TIME YOU

01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:36.271
GET TO THE END OF THE AND

01:19:36.338 --> 01:19:39.074
COLLECTION OF DATA YOU'RE GOING

01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:40.375
TO BE COMING UP ON THIS CYCLE

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:43.879
OF NEEDING TO REFRESH THAT DATA.

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:44.946
AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE. WEAK

01:19:45.013 --> 01:19:45.814
THANKS FOR THE AGENCY. TO

01:19:45.881 --> 01:19:47.382
PRESENT INFORMATION TO THE

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:49.117
LEGISLATURE ON WHAT ARE THE

01:19:49.184 --> 01:19:51.319
SPECIFIC USES SOME OF THOSE

01:19:51.386 --> 01:19:53.455
USES AND THAT HE COULDN'T

01:19:53.522 --> 01:19:55.157
REQUIRE KNEADING THE DATA TO BE

01:19:55.223 --> 01:19:56.992
REFRESHED VERY FREQUENTLY-

01:19:57.058 --> 01:19:58.927
OTHERS MAYBE THEY DATA DOESN'T

01:19:58.994 --> 01:20:00.729
NEED TO BE REFRESHED AS OFTEN.

01:20:00.795 --> 01:20:02.797
BUT BEFORE YOU COMMIT TO DOING

01:20:02.864 --> 01:20:03.398
THIS YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO

01:20:03.465 --> 01:20:05.333
HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT EXACTLY ON

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.535
IS THIS GOING TO BE USED FOR

01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:07.402
HOW IS THIS GOING TO FILTER

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:09.137
DOWN INTO PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES.

01:20:09.204 --> 01:20:10.572
AND BETTER DECISION MAKING ON

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:12.774
THE PART OF STATE ENTITIES AND

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:13.942
FOR THOSE PROGRAMS THAT REALLY

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:15.777
HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE TO

01:20:15.844 --> 01:20:17.712
UTILIZE THIS BETTER DATA. HOW

01:20:17.779 --> 01:20:18.747
OFTEN IS THAT GOING TO HAVE TO

01:20:18.813 --> 01:20:20.081
BE REFRESHED IS THIS GOING TO

01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:21.283
BE SOMETHING WHERE THE

01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:22.651
LEGISLATURE IS REALLY GOING TO

01:20:22.717 --> 01:20:24.786
NEED TO APPROVE ANOTHER EIGHTY

01:20:24.853 --> 01:20:27.322
MILLION DOLLARS IN THE NEXT

01:20:27.389 --> 01:20:27.923
FIVE TO TEN YEARS TO CONTINUE

01:20:27.989 --> 01:20:29.457
THE DATA- OR THEIR

01:20:29.524 --> 01:20:31.693
OPPORTUNITIES TO MAYBE. FOCUS

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:32.861
IT ON HIGH JUST SORT OF HIGH

01:20:32.928 --> 01:20:34.963
PRIORITY AREAS WHERE THAT THE

01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:37.365
STATE IS ALREADY MORE GEARED UP

01:20:37.432 --> 01:20:39.367
TO BE ABLE TO USE THE DATA. SO

01:20:39.434 --> 01:20:40.168
BECAUSE OF ALL THAT WE

01:20:40.235 --> 01:20:43.305
RECOMMEND WITHHOLDING ACTION ON

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:45.707
THIS I BELIEVE IT COME AND PULL

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:47.676
THIS THEM OPEN TO A- I'M AND- I

01:20:47.742 --> 01:20:49.311
COMMEND. YOU SEE REPORT BACK

01:20:49.377 --> 01:20:51.012
WITHOUT MORE ROBUST

01:20:51.079 --> 01:20:54.816
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THEY'RE IN

01:20:54.883 --> 01:20:55.684
THE PROCESS OF MOVING TO THE X.

01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:57.719
THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE

01:20:57.786 --> 01:20:59.688
ROBUST IMPLEMENT. A PLAN TO

01:20:59.754 --> 01:21:02.557
YOU. IS BY CYCLE THEN WITH

01:21:02.624 --> 01:21:03.825
COLLECTION REJECTING PULLS UP

01:21:03.892 --> 01:21:04.659
AND ASKING THEM TO COME BACK IN

01:21:04.726 --> 01:21:06.461
A WHEN THEY HAVE A MORE FULLY

01:21:06.528 --> 01:21:10.165
DEVELOPED PROPOSAL. SO THINK

01:21:10.232 --> 01:21:11.700
THE DOCTOR PREPARE TO RE. TO

01:21:11.766 --> 01:21:15.537
MAKE. UNDERSTAND THE ORIGINAL

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:17.105
FROM THE PRESENTATION THAT YOU

01:21:17.172 --> 01:21:20.875
MADE DR GOLD TO THAT YOU WERE.

01:21:20.942 --> 01:21:22.911
RATHER SPECIFIC ABOUT THE A

01:21:22.978 --> 01:21:27.249
VARIETY OF USES THAT- THAT THE

01:21:27.315 --> 01:21:30.919
LIGHT ARE- CAN CAN BE HELPFUL

01:21:30.986 --> 01:21:34.489
WITH. I HINK WHAT I'M HEARING

01:21:34.556 --> 01:21:35.757
FROM LA- WHAT WE'RE HEARING

01:21:35.824 --> 01:21:38.393
FROM LA- IS THAT IT WOULD ALSO

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:40.629
BE HELPFUL TO HAVE A BREAK DOWN

01:21:40.695 --> 01:21:42.864
ON WHEN THE REFRESH DATES FOR

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:48.403
EACH OF THOSE USES- WOULD BE AT

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:49.871
THAT WOULD BE IN ORDER. AND

01:21:49.938 --> 01:21:52.240
JUST PROGRAMMATIC LEE HOW THIS

01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:53.975
PROGRAM IT IS A CONSIDERABLE

01:21:54.042 --> 01:21:54.876
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S BEING

01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:57.212
ASKED FOR. IT IS A NEW PROGRAM

01:21:57.279 --> 01:21:58.880
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT GETS

01:21:58.947 --> 01:22:01.750
OFF THE OFF THE GROUND TO A

01:22:01.816 --> 01:22:04.386
SUCCESSFULLY. OF HOW WOULD YOU

01:22:04.452 --> 01:22:05.854
SUGGEST WE GO ABOUT DOING THAT

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.556
AND- YOU. WILL HAVE PLENTY OF

01:22:08.623 --> 01:22:11.726
TIME BETWEEN NOW AND A REVISED-

01:22:11.793 --> 01:22:13.795
TO- COME BACK WITH MORE

01:22:13.862 --> 01:22:15.764
DETAILED INFORMATION BUT- GIVE

01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:17.232
US AN OVERVIEW ON THAT NOW THAT

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:19.734
WOULD BE GREAT. SO OUR ALL STAR

01:22:19.801 --> 01:22:21.469
DONE EMPLOYED PASSING OVER BET

01:22:21.536 --> 01:22:23.138
ON BREAK IT UP INTO A WALL JACK

01:22:23.204 --> 01:22:26.908
LIFE. ON SO- THANK YOU I HE

01:22:26.975 --> 01:22:28.343
MIGHT MY REMARKS ARE ACTUALLY

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:31.813
MADE ON. KNOWING WHAT THE LA

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:34.482
KNOWS- COMMENTS WERE IN IN SO I

01:22:34.549 --> 01:22:35.750
REALLY WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT

01:22:35.817 --> 01:22:37.285
THOSE USES AND THAT THESE ARE

01:22:37.352 --> 01:22:39.754
YOU SAYS. THAT ON. THE BEING

01:22:39.821 --> 01:22:40.989
USED TODAY THIS IT'S NOT

01:22:41.056 --> 01:22:42.390
PREMATURE IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR

01:22:42.457 --> 01:22:43.591
FORM THIS IS EMERGENCY

01:22:43.658 --> 01:22:45.160
PREPAREDNESS USING THE BEST

01:22:45.226 --> 01:22:46.227
AVAILABLE SCIENCE TO GET US

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:48.096
THERE. I'M IT JUST SO HAPPENS

01:22:48.163 --> 01:22:50.231
THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER USES FOR

01:22:50.298 --> 01:22:51.566
LIGHT ARE OTHER THAN EMERGENCY

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:52.834
PREPAREDNESS BUT WE COULD

01:22:52.901 --> 01:22:54.736
SPEND. OUR WHOLE TIME TALKING

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.504
ABOUT WALL SUBSIDENCE WHAT IS

01:22:56.571 --> 01:22:57.906
THAT GOING TO DO TO OUR WATER

01:22:57.972 --> 01:22:59.074
INFRASTRUCTURE WHAT IT YOU KNOW

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:01.142
WHAT- WE HAVE CLIP CORROSION

01:23:01.209 --> 01:23:02.777
PROBLEMS THE IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:23:02.844 --> 01:23:05.013
SAN DIEGO AREA. ON YOU HAVE

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:07.015
INVESTMENT IN THAT REGION THAT

01:23:07.082 --> 01:23:08.283
THEY'RE THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING

01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:10.085
WHAT OUR FARM OR FREQUENTLY

01:23:10.151 --> 01:23:11.920
BECAUSE THEY'RE SEEN AND IS.

01:23:11.986 --> 01:23:14.155
ARE CURRENTLY AND- STRUCK OF

01:23:14.222 --> 01:23:16.524
THE COST GEOLOGY. ON SUCH A

01:23:16.591 --> 01:23:17.359
FREAK BASIS AND AN WE'VE ALL

01:23:17.425 --> 01:23:19.427
BEEN FOLLOWING ON THE- DOWN

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:22.063
THERE. ON IT WE DON'T NEED TO

01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:23.465
TALK ABOUT WITHOUT FIRE IN THIS

01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:24.499
GROUP FROM THE STATE YOU KNOW

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:26.067
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF WHAT

01:23:26.134 --> 01:23:28.870
RISKS ARE. AND HOW THIS HELPS.

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:30.238
IT'S NOT. THE REASON WHY I

01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:32.207
TALKED ABOUT LINKING WITH OTHER

01:23:32.273 --> 01:23:34.342
SETS OF INFORMATION YOU CAN'T

01:23:34.409 --> 01:23:36.644
JUST LOOK AT LINE ARE ALONE. IN

01:23:36.711 --> 01:23:38.713
A BOX RIGHT IT HAS TO BE USED

01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:41.883
IN CONJUNCTION. WITH OTHER

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:43.518
SORTS OF TOOLS TO REALLY GET

01:23:43.585 --> 01:23:45.387
THE MOST OUT OF IT AND THAT'S

01:23:45.453 --> 01:23:46.721
WHY I GAVE SOME VERY COMMON

01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:52.026
SENSE. EVERY DAY SORTS. OF USES

01:23:52.093 --> 01:23:53.328
AT THE AT ON THE ARE WOULD BE

01:23:53.395 --> 01:23:55.296
WITH WITH ON SET. AND OTHER%

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:58.566
FIXED WING. ON ERR AIRBORNE.

01:23:58.633 --> 01:24:00.435
WERE ABOUT A REMOTE SENSING

01:24:00.502 --> 01:24:02.203
TECHNIQUES. ON THE COULD BE

01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:03.338
TREMENDOUS VALUE WHETHER YOU

01:24:03.405 --> 01:24:05.273
LIVE IN A CITY OR WHERE DO YOU

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:06.508
LIVE ON THE COAST BUT WHAT DO

01:24:06.574 --> 01:24:08.143
YOU LIVE IN A FORESTED AREA OR

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:09.344
AN AREA PRONE TO FIRE THERE

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:11.946
THERE'S- THE USES. ON OUR OUR

01:24:12.013 --> 01:24:15.250
ABSOLUTELY. ON ESSENTIAL FOR

01:24:15.316 --> 01:24:16.484
THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:24:16.551 --> 01:24:18.319
RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROTECTION.

01:24:18.386 --> 01:24:19.654
OF PUBLIC HEALTH FROM THE

01:24:19.721 --> 01:24:20.855
STANDPOINT OF NEXT STEPS I'M

01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:22.757
GONNA PASS ON TO MY- IT CAN YOU

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:25.427
ALSO- ADDRESSED THE NOTION OF-

01:24:25.493 --> 01:24:28.329
WHETHER- THIS IS TIMELY OR

01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:29.531
PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT PREMATURE

01:24:29.597 --> 01:24:30.965
I THINK THAT WAS WHAT. ANOTHER

01:24:31.032 --> 01:24:32.734
POINT THE ALEJO YEAH I THINK

01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:34.235
THAT WAS MY POINT WAS IT'S

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:38.039
NEVER PREMATURE TO BE MOREPREPARED FOR AN EMERGENCY. ON

01:24:38.106 --> 01:24:39.641
IN AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S

01:24:39.707 --> 01:24:41.342
REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AND

01:24:41.409 --> 01:24:42.410
THIS IS GOING TO HELP US. IN

01:24:42.477 --> 01:24:43.945
EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:45.680
ABOUTA HUNDRED DIFFERENT WAYS

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:47.615
ON AND THAT'S THAT'S A REALLY

01:24:47.682 --> 01:24:50.518
ONE EMPHASIZE THAT PART. ON IN

01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:50.985
IT HELPS US ON CLIMATE

01:24:51.052 --> 01:24:53.388
ADAPTATION WHICH IS YOU HEARD

01:24:53.455 --> 01:24:55.390
FROM THE SECRETARY. IS YOU KNOW

01:24:55.457 --> 01:24:56.524
ONE OF THE BIGGEST PRIORITIES

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:58.760
OF THIS ADMINISTRATION IS TO

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:00.962
MOVE FORWARD ON. SO ONE OF THE

01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:03.264
KEY PIECES I'D LIKE TO MAKE

01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:06.034
SURE THAT THAT WE GET OUT ON

01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:09.003
THE TABLE. IS LIGHT ARE- IS A

01:25:09.070 --> 01:25:11.072
NEW BUZZWORD. BUT IT'S NOT

01:25:11.139 --> 01:25:12.974
NECESSARILY NEW TECHNOLOGY. IT

01:25:13.041 --> 01:25:15.210
IS EXISTED AND BEEN IN ACTIVE

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:17.111
USE FOR A LONG TIME. WHAT'S

01:25:17.178 --> 01:25:19.080
CAUGHT UP. IS THE REST OF OUR

01:25:19.147 --> 01:25:21.082
COMPUTING POWER. THE

01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:23.685
UNIVERSITY'S TRAINING STAFF ON

01:25:23.751 --> 01:25:25.954
HOW TO MAKE FULL USE OF IT- THE

01:25:26.020 --> 01:25:28.923
ABILITY FOR. US TO STORE

01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:31.226
TRANSMIT. A PROCESS PARTICULAR

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:32.160
WITH SOME OF THE MACHINE

01:25:32.227 --> 01:25:33.728
LEARNING AND ARTIFICIAL

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:35.897
INTELLIGENCE TYPE TECHNIQUES.

01:25:35.964 --> 01:25:37.832
TO REALLY DERIVE THE DEEPEST

01:25:37.899 --> 01:25:40.602
SETS OF. INFORMATION PRODUCTS

01:25:40.668 --> 01:25:43.872
THAT WE CAN FROM THE DATA IT'S

01:25:43.938 --> 01:25:45.807
OUR GEOLOGISTS IS- IN THE

01:25:45.874 --> 01:25:47.509
DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION

01:25:47.575 --> 01:25:49.177
EVERYWHERE THAT THEY CAN LAY

01:25:49.244 --> 01:25:50.879
THEIR HANDS ON IT RIGHT NOW

01:25:50.945 --> 01:25:53.147
THEY ARE PULLING THIS DATA AND

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:55.316
FOUR LANDSLIDE MAPPING FOR THE

01:25:55.383 --> 01:25:58.319
REVIEW OF TIMBER HARVEST PLANS

01:25:58.386 --> 01:26:00.488
FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF FAULT

01:26:00.555 --> 01:26:02.991
NOT FAULT AREAS THAT MAY MAY

01:26:03.057 --> 01:26:05.827
POSE A RISK. HI IT IS IN VERY

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:08.763
ACTIVE USE RIGHT NOW WHEREVER

01:26:08.830 --> 01:26:10.598
THEY CAN LAY THEIR HANDS ON IT

01:26:10.665 --> 01:26:13.434
HI AND THERE ARE MANY PORTIONS

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:14.836
OF THE STATE FOR WHICH IT IS

01:26:14.903 --> 01:26:18.139
NOT AVAILABLE- THAT- NOW'S THE

01:26:18.206 --> 01:26:20.275
TIME I BELIEVE FOR US TO GET

01:26:20.341 --> 01:26:22.477
AHEAD OF THAT BALL SO THAT WE

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:23.912
CAN START BUILDING THOSE

01:26:23.978 --> 01:26:26.381
INFORMATION PRODUCTS TO MAKE

01:26:26.447 --> 01:26:26.814
THOSE DECISIONS MORE

01:26:26.881 --> 01:26:27.982
EFFECTIVELY. BUT BEEN

01:26:28.049 --> 01:26:30.685
RESPONDING ON THE NEXT STEPS TO

01:26:30.752 --> 01:26:31.686
SELF SAY WHATEVER REACTIONS

01:26:31.753 --> 01:26:34.556
WILL BE DEBT SO NEXT NEXT STEPS

01:26:34.622 --> 01:26:37.358
UP. TRY TO GET TRY TO BRING THE

01:26:37.425 --> 01:26:39.060
DATA IN HOUSE SO THAT WE CAN

01:26:39.127 --> 01:26:41.229
BUILD THIS PRODUCTS GET THEM

01:26:41.296 --> 01:26:41.763
INTO THE DECISION MAKING

01:26:41.829 --> 01:26:44.499
PROCESSES TRACK HOW THOSE

01:26:44.566 --> 01:26:46.301
DECISION MAKING PROCESSES. ARE

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:48.102
CHANGING SO THAT WE CAN

01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:50.405
UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR RETURN ON

01:26:50.471 --> 01:26:51.639
INVESTMENT IS FORCE THIS

01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:54.075
COLLECTION. AND FORECAST MORE

EFFECTIVELY WHAT THOSE WILL BE

01:26:56.110 --> 01:26:57.445
FOR ANY FUTURE COLLECTIONS

01:26:57.512 --> 01:26:59.380
INCLUDING THE PHASING THAT MAY

01:26:59.447 --> 01:27:04.052
BE NECESSARY. IN ORDER TO- TO

ACROSS THE STATE IS HEALTHCARE

01:27:10.758 --> 01:27:11.826
BUT I THINK IN A NUTSHELL WHAT

01:27:11.893 --> 01:27:12.860

OF- OF- THE DEVELOPMENT OF

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.343
LASER TECHNOLOGY MANY DECADES

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:32.246
AGO WHICH I THINK WAS- A FIRST

01:27:32.313 --> 01:27:34.215
INVENTED BACK ENOUGH IN THE

01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:36.384
FIFTIES BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY-

01:27:36.451 --> 01:27:38.720
START TO BECOME BROADLY USED TO

01:27:38.786 --> 01:27:40.555
UNTIL THE SEVENTIES AND THEN

01:27:40.622 --> 01:27:43.024
THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION OF USES

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:45.360
IN TODAY'S TECHNOLOGICAL WORLD-

01:27:45.426 --> 01:27:47.962
LIGHT ARE- ISN'T NEW BUT IT'S

01:27:48.029 --> 01:27:51.933
ALSO NOT THAT OLD YET AND-

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:52.533
WE'RE EXPERIENCING NOW I THINK

AND TO- WE ONLY HAVE A LIMITED

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:08.216
AMOUNT OF TIME IN THE BUDGET

01:28:08.282 --> 01:28:09.684

ITEM BASICALLY TO SUPPORT- A

01:31:14.001 --> 01:31:16.470
LOT OF WHAT IS WAS SAID FIRST

01:31:16.537 --> 01:31:19.307
OF ALL- IT'S A NEW TOOL IT'S A

01:31:19.373 --> 01:31:22.510
NEW SET OF EYE GLASSES FOR-

01:31:22.577 --> 01:31:24.545
NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT NET

01:31:24.612 --> 01:31:26.848
THAT MAY SOUND DIMINUTIVE BUT

01:31:26.914 --> 01:31:29.750
IT IS IT BRINGS US INTO THE

01:31:29.817 --> 01:31:30.484
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY IN TERMS

01:31:30.551 --> 01:31:33.154
OF. IDENTIFYING THE STRUCTURE

01:31:33.221 --> 01:31:34.455
OF VEGETATION ON THE GROUND

01:31:34.522 --> 01:31:37.124
WHICH IS IMPORTANT WHEN WEAR

01:31:37.191 --> 01:31:39.427
IDENTIFYING IN IMPORTANT

01:31:39.493 --> 01:31:41.829
COMPONENTS FOR WILDLIFE WHEN

01:31:41.896 --> 01:31:45.166
WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW TO- DESIGN

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:46.767
A STRICT NETWORK OF STRATEGIC

01:31:46.834 --> 01:31:48.803
FUEL BREAKS ACROSS THE

01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:49.904
LANDSCAPE BECAUSE BOTH NATIONAL

01:31:49.971 --> 01:31:52.673
FOREST IN AND PRIVATE LANDS IN

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:54.909
STATE OWNED LANDS- AND

01:31:54.976 --> 01:31:58.312
PRESCRIPTIONS FOR HOW TO THIN

01:31:58.379 --> 01:32:01.115
FORCED ECOLOGICALLY THAT ALSO

01:32:01.182 --> 01:32:03.751
PROVIDED FIRE HAZARD- REDUCTION

01:32:03.818 --> 01:32:07.555
SO HOW DO WE DO THAT. AND HOW

01:32:07.622 --> 01:32:09.123
DOES LIGHT ARE IMPROVE OUR

01:32:09.190 --> 01:32:11.259
ABILITY TO DO THAT IT GIVES US.

01:32:11.325 --> 01:32:13.761
A THREE DIMENSIONAL VIEW AT A

01:32:13.828 --> 01:32:16.063
VERY FINE SCALE THAT ALLOWS US

01:32:16.130 --> 01:32:17.999
TO GET DOWN TO ACRE AND SO

01:32:18.065 --> 01:32:21.369
BAKER- DESIGNS OF OUR

01:32:21.435 --> 01:32:24.138
TREATMENTS. THAT PREVIOUSLY

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:25.373
WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ITERATIVE

01:32:25.439 --> 01:32:27.775
PROCESS USING WHAT SOMEONE CALL

01:32:27.842 --> 01:32:29.977
I'D ARE WE CAN WE JUMP TO LIGHT

01:32:30.044 --> 01:32:31.846
ARE UP LET ME GIVE YOU ONE

01:32:31.913 --> 01:32:34.982
SPECIFIC EXAMPLE IN MY CASE.

WORKING WITH THE ELDORADO

01:32:35.917 --> 01:32:37.919
NATIONAL FOREST IN THE LAST

01:32:37.985 --> 01:32:40.521
THREE YEARS. WORK THAT HAS

01:32:40.588 --> 01:32:43.157
STARTED IN- THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:45.059
CALIFORNIA THE ACADEMICS

01:32:45.126 --> 01:32:48.095
LOOKING AT- WILDLIFE BEHAVIOR

01:32:48.162 --> 01:32:49.597
THIS CASE CALIFORNIA SPOTTED

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:51.933
OWL AND THEN COMPARING THAT TO

01:32:51.999 --> 01:32:53.434
NEW LIGHT OUR INFORMATION

01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:54.435
THAT'S AVAILABLE. WE HAVE BEEN

01:32:54.502 --> 01:32:56.671
ABLE TO OUR S. RESEARCHERS HAVE

01:32:56.737 --> 01:32:58.906
BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY. AT A SO

01:32:58.973 --> 01:33:02.476
BAKER SCALE. THE HIGH CANOPY

01:33:02.543 --> 01:33:04.578
TOLD THREE ELEMENTS OF A FOREST

01:33:04.645 --> 01:33:06.147
THAT THE SPOTTED OWLS ARE

01:33:06.213 --> 01:33:08.282
ABSOLUTELY USING FOR THEIR

01:33:08.349 --> 01:33:11.385
NESTING. SO NOW WITH LIGHT ARE

01:33:11.452 --> 01:33:13.521
WHERE LIGHTERS AVAILABLE WE CAN

01:33:13.587 --> 01:33:15.156
PICK THOSE COMPONENTS OUT. SO

01:33:15.222 --> 01:33:17.058
THAT WAS THE RESURGENT TWENTY

01:33:17.124 --> 01:33:17.825
SEVENTEEN THAT IS NOW DOWN

01:33:17.892 --> 01:33:19.226
SCALED DOWN TO ACTUALLY TRYING

01:33:19.293 --> 01:33:20.861
TO GET IT DOWN THE FIELD.

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:23.331
GETTING PRACTITIONERS TO USE

01:33:23.397 --> 01:33:25.232
LIGHT ARE WHERE IT'S AVAILABLE

TO FIRST PICK OUT THOSE

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:27.268
ELEMENTS WHERE TIMBER

01:33:27.335 --> 01:33:30.137
HARVESTING AND COMMERCIAL

01:33:30.204 --> 01:33:32.773
THINNING AND FUEL REDUCTION IS

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:34.976
PLANNED. AND FIND THOSE

01:33:35.042 --> 01:33:37.044
ELEMENTS AND CREATE NEW

01:33:37.111 --> 01:33:38.512
TREATMENTS AROUND WHERE THOSE

01:33:38.579 --> 01:33:39.880
ARE IN A MORE EFFECTIVE AND

01:33:39.947 --> 01:33:42.350
EXPEDITIOUS WAY WHICH LASTLY

EXPENDITURES IN A PRETTY

01:51:59.612 --> 01:52:01.081
COMPLICATED BUDGET MOST WOULD

01:52:01.147 --> 01:52:02.615
SAY ONE OF THE MORE COMPLICATED

01:52:02.682 --> 01:52:05.919
BUDGET. AND STATE GOVERNMENT.

01:52:05.985 --> 01:52:07.487
BUT I WANT TO END WITH THE

01:52:07.554 --> 01:52:10.857
STORY. THAT'S MORE THAN JUST

01:52:10.924 --> 01:52:12.959
THIS BUSINESS ANALYTICS IF YOU

01:52:13.026 --> 01:52:14.561
COULD GO BACK TO THE SLIDE

01:52:14.627 --> 01:52:17.197
THAT'S THE PICTURE OF. TWO

01:52:17.263 --> 01:52:17.730
BIRDS WITH A FISH STUCK IN

01:52:17.797 --> 01:52:21.501
BETWEEN. EACH YEAR WE RUN A

01:52:21.568 --> 01:52:24.637
CONTEST WE PICK A PHOTO THE IS

01:52:24.704 --> 01:52:25.705
THE BEST PHOTO OF WILDLIFE

01:52:25.772 --> 01:52:29.275
ACTION. THIS IS THE PHOTO I

01:52:29.342 --> 01:52:31.444
PICKED FIRST EARS DIRECTOR.

01:52:31.511 --> 01:52:32.045
BECAUSE WHEN I LOOKED AT IT I

01:52:32.112 --> 01:52:34.948
THOUGHT. YOU'VE GOT TO BIRDS

01:52:35.014 --> 01:52:36.483
WENT FLYING IN AN OPPOSITE

01:52:36.549 --> 01:52:38.084
DIRECTION EACH WITH ITS TALONS

01:52:38.151 --> 01:52:41.354
IN A BIRD. STUCK IN THE MIDDLE

01:52:41.421 --> 01:52:41.955
AND I THOUGHT THAT'S LIKE LIFE

01:52:42.021 --> 01:52:43.523
IN OUR DEPARTMENT. STUCK IN THE

01:52:43.590 --> 01:52:46.159
MIDDLE. BUT THEN I THOUGHT MORE

01:52:46.226 --> 01:52:48.294
ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT WHAT WHY DO

01:52:48.361 --> 01:52:49.496
WE FIND ARE STILL STUCK IN THE

01:52:49.562 --> 01:52:51.965
MIDDLE ON MANY THINGS MY SENSE

01:52:52.031 --> 01:52:53.233
IS IT'S BECAUSE OUR MISSION IS

01:52:53.299 --> 01:52:57.337
ABOUT NATURE. AND IT'S A NATURE

01:52:57.403 --> 01:52:59.172
THAT EXIST IN A POPULATION OF

01:52:59.239 --> 01:53:00.340
FORTY MILLION PEOPLE THAT'S

01:53:00.406 --> 01:53:02.308
GOING TO FIFTY MILLION. AND

01:53:02.375 --> 01:53:04.410
THIS NATURE IS EVERYTHING IT'S

01:53:04.477 --> 01:53:07.213
B. EASE IT'S BUTTERFLIES IT'S

01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:09.549
WHALES IT'S MOUNT LINES IT'S

01:53:09.616 --> 01:53:12.585
KELP FOREST. AND WE VIEW OUR

01:53:12.652 --> 01:53:14.087
MISSIONS AS PRESERVING THIS

01:53:14.154 --> 01:53:15.388
LAND THIS WATER IN THIS

01:53:15.455 --> 01:53:17.724
WILDLIFE AS PART OF A THRIVING

01:53:17.790 --> 01:53:20.126
ECONOMY. THEY'RE INTERDEPENDENT

01:53:20.193 --> 01:53:22.095
THEY'RE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE

01:53:22.162 --> 01:53:23.963
WITH IT'S A IT'S A FUTURE IT'S

01:53:24.030 --> 01:53:26.566
A NATURE OF SIX HUNDRED AND

01:53:26.633 --> 01:53:28.601

CALIFORNIA BEING THE FIFTH

IS GOING TO HAVE TO WEIGH IN

01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:38.331
HER BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE HOW

01:55:38.398 --> 01:55:39.966
MUCH OF IT AS- DO YOU KNOW

01:55:40.033 --> 01:55:41.701
WHERE. WHERE THIS ALL IS COMING

01:55:41.768 --> 01:55:44.537
FROM BUT- TO JUST T. THIS UP A

01:55:44.604 --> 01:55:49.309
LITTLE BIT. I WAS GONNA SAY WE

01:55:49.375 --> 01:55:50.610
THOUGHT WE HAD A DEAL LAST YEAR

01:55:50.677 --> 01:55:52.378
THERE ACTUALLY WAS A DEAL THAT

01:55:52.445 --> 01:55:57.684
WAS CUT ON- THE BCP FOR THE-

01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:59.152
HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND

01:55:59.218 --> 01:56:03.856
SHIFT- AND- IN THIS. YEAR'S

01:56:03.923 --> 01:56:05.525
BUDGET SOMETHING NEW HAS BEEN

01:56:05.591 --> 01:56:07.994
PROPOSED AND- SO THE

01:56:08.061 --> 01:56:09.796
FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION IS WHAT

01:56:09.862 --> 01:56:13.032
HAPPENED THAT DEAL. CHAIR IF I

01:56:13.099 --> 01:56:16.002
COULD START YEAH. LET ME SET

01:56:16.069 --> 01:56:18.838
THE STAGE ON THE CURRENT BUDGET

01:56:18.905 --> 01:56:21.507
PROPOSAL BUT MAKE SURE I

01:56:21.574 --> 01:56:23.276
CONNECTED TO THE LAST AGENDA

01:56:23.343 --> 01:56:26.846
ISSUE. AND THEN I'M A TURN

01:56:26.913 --> 01:56:27.747
ABOUT BECAUSE THE FINANCE FOR

01:56:27.814 --> 01:56:29.148
THE MORE DIFFICULT PARTY A

01:56:29.215 --> 01:56:31.851
QUESTION. WHAT YOU HAVE IN

01:56:31.918 --> 01:56:34.887
FRONT OF YOU. IS IT I THINK AN

01:56:34.954 --> 01:56:37.957
EXCITING SUBSTANTIVE PROPOSAL.

01:56:38.024 --> 01:56:39.192
IT TAKES THE WORK I JUST

01:56:39.258 --> 01:56:42.528
DESCRIBED. WHILE REALIZING WE

01:56:42.595 --> 01:56:45.231
HAVE A BIGGER BOLDER STILL TO

01:56:45.298 --> 01:56:47.900
COMPLETE SERVICE BASED

01:56:47.967 --> 01:56:49.769
BUDGETING DYNAMIC WE KNOW

01:56:49.836 --> 01:56:52.872
ENOUGH RIGHT NOW BASED ON OUR

01:56:52.939 --> 01:56:55.274
EXTERNAL ADVISORS AND THE DATA.

01:56:55.341 --> 01:56:57.110
TO PROPOSE SOME REALLY SMART

01:56:57.176 --> 01:56:59.078
SURGICAL INVESTMENTS THAT HAVE

01:56:59.145 --> 01:57:00.913
HIGH RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:03.649
CALIFORNIA IT'S SO IN MY MIND

01:57:03.716 --> 01:57:07.186
THE SUBSTANCE IS SOLID. AND

01:57:07.253 --> 01:57:10.056
IT'S A PROPOSAL OF AN

01:57:10.123 --> 01:57:11.524
AUGMENTATION OF THIRTY EIGHT

01:57:11.591 --> 01:57:14.360
POINT NINE MILLION. AN

01:57:14.427 --> 01:57:14.827
ADDITIONAL FIFTY EIGHT

01:57:14.894 --> 01:57:17.864
POSITIONS AND THE CONTINUANCE

01:57:17.930 --> 01:57:19.399
OF THAT PRIOR LIMITED

01:57:19.465 --> 01:57:22.735
AUGMENTATION. WHAT I THINK

01:57:22.802 --> 01:57:27.140
YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT IS THE HOWL

01:57:27.206 --> 01:57:28.040
ONE WOULD DO THAT FINANCING

01:57:28.107 --> 01:57:30.410
INVESTMENT WHICH TRIGGERS AS

01:57:30.476 --> 01:57:33.012
YOU KNOW A COMPONENT OF LIFE

01:57:33.079 --> 01:57:35.448
FUNDS SWAP FOR A PORTION OF

01:57:35.515 --> 01:57:37.917
THIS GENERAL FUND FROM THE

01:57:37.984 --> 01:57:40.153
HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND WHICH

01:57:40.219 --> 01:57:41.487
DIRECTS MONIES TO THE WILDLIFE

01:57:41.554 --> 01:57:45.358
CONSERVATION BOARD. AND INSTEAD

01:57:45.425 --> 01:57:45.925
THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY TO OUR

01:57:45.992 --> 01:57:47.760
DEPARTMENT. MAKING THE

01:57:47.827 --> 01:57:48.895
CALCULATION WHICH I THINK IT'S

01:57:48.961 --> 01:57:52.265
CREDIBLE. YOU COULD POTENTIALLY

01:57:52.331 --> 01:57:53.566
GET GREATER RETURN ON

01:57:53.633 --> 01:57:55.701
INVESTMENT THROUGH PROGRAM

01:57:55.768 --> 01:57:57.637
INVESTMENT AT OUR DEPARTMENT.

01:57:57.703 --> 01:57:59.205
GIVEN THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION

01:57:59.272 --> 01:58:03.209
BOARD HAS A BALANCED BUDGET.

01:58:03.276 --> 01:58:06.012
AND USES THAT EIGHTEEN MILLION

01:58:06.078 --> 01:58:08.247
DOLLARS FOR SMALL ISOLATED

01:58:08.314 --> 01:58:10.149
GRANTS AROUND THE STATE THAT'S

01:58:10.216 --> 01:58:12.418
THE LOGIC THAT'S THE QUESTION

01:58:12.485 --> 01:58:13.786
YOU'RE GETTING AT LET ME TURN

01:58:13.853 --> 01:58:14.654
TO MY COLLEAGUE AT THE

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:15.955
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO TAKE

01:58:16.022 --> 01:58:19.192
IT MORE DIRECTLY. A THIRD- I'VE

DON'T THINK YOU'RE GETTING THE-

01:59:43.843 --> 01:59:45.578
A TO THE HEART OF MY QUESTION

01:59:45.645 --> 01:59:47.280
LAST YEAR DURING THE BUDGET

01:59:47.346 --> 01:59:49.549
PROCESS THERE WAS A VERY

01:59:49.615 --> 01:59:52.451
CAREFULLY- NEGOTIATED

01:59:52.518 --> 01:59:54.053
COMPROMISE THAT EXTENDED THE

01:59:54.120 --> 01:59:56.389
SUNSET DATE FOR THE WILDLIFE

01:59:56.455 --> 01:59:58.524
CONSERVATION FUND RIGHT. I

01:59:58.591 --> 02:00:00.660
EXCUSE ME THAT HABITAT

02:00:00.726 --> 02:00:04.730

IS BEING UNDONE IN THE CURRENT

02:00:07.934 --> 02:00:11.871
BUDGET PROPOSAL. SO WHAT I ATE

02:00:11.938 --> 02:00:15.942

A IT CAN JUST ARBITRARILY BE-

02:00:27.286 --> 02:00:29.689
UNDONE BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY

02:00:29.755 --> 02:00:34.193
IT FEELS TO ME AND I THINK TO-

02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:37.463
BUDGET STAFF- WE HAVE TO BE

02:00:37.530 --> 02:00:39.765

FAITH WITH ONE ANOTHER THERE

02:00:41.601 --> 02:00:44.904
MAY BE VERY VALID REASONS FOR

02:00:44.971 --> 02:00:47.406
ON DOING THIS BUT IT'S A DEAL

02:00:47.473 --> 02:00:48.975
AND IF IT'S GONNA BE UNDONE IT

02:00:49.041 --> 02:00:50.943
OUGHT TO BE ON DONE BY BOTH

02:00:51.010 --> 02:00:52.712

SYSTEM AND SWITCH ALL DIESEL

02:06:11.330 --> 02:06:14.533
PUMPS TO SOLAR ARRAYS. AND THAT

02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:16.302
WILL REDUCE OUR OWN EMISSIONS

02:06:16.368 --> 02:06:18.437
AND AUTOMATE OUR WATER DELIVERY

02:06:18.504 --> 02:06:19.772
TO KEEP WETLANDS WEDDED FOR

02:06:28.614 --> 02:06:30.382
HAVING A PLANE AVAILABLE WITH

02:06:30.449 --> 02:06:32.418
MODERN CONFIGURATION WILL ALLOW

02:06:32.484 --> 02:06:33.752
US TO MONITOR THE OCEAN KEEP

02:06:33.819 --> 02:06:35.821

MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS A

02:09:09.675 --> 02:09:11.110
CONTINUATION OF SORT OF THE

02:09:11.176 --> 02:09:13.078
DEAL THAT CAME TOGETHER THAT

02:09:13.145 --> 02:09:13.712
LAUNCHED INTO THE SERVICE BASED

02:09:13.779 --> 02:09:16.915
BUDGETING EFFORT. HOWEVER AS

02:09:16.982 --> 02:09:17.549
IT'S ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED OUR

02:09:17.616 --> 02:09:20.819
BIG CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS- THE

02:09:20.886 --> 02:09:24.590
DELETION OF THE- SUNSET DATE I

02:09:24.656 --> 02:09:26.458
AND ESSENTIALLY THE ELIMINATION

02:09:26.525 --> 02:09:27.926
OF THE HABITAT CONSERVATION

02:09:27.993 --> 02:09:29.294
COUNTRY TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

02:09:29.361 --> 02:09:31.096
AND ALSO THE FUN SHIFT OF

02:09:31.163 --> 02:09:32.431
HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND

02:09:32.498 --> 02:09:34.133

WHAT ARE EXTREMELY LAUDABLE

02:09:38.137 --> 02:09:39.671
PROGRAM SO LET ME JUST START

02:09:39.738 --> 02:09:41.840
FIRST OF ALL WE DO NOT HAVE A

02:09:41.907 --> 02:09:42.541
PROBLEM WITH WHAT THEY'RE

02:09:42.608 --> 02:09:44.243
PROPOSING TO FIND WITH THE

02:09:44.309 --> 02:09:45.677
EIGHTEEN POINT NINE MILLION AS

02:09:45.744 --> 02:09:46.545
SOMEONE WHO WORKED ON

02:09:46.612 --> 02:09:47.779
ENDANGERED SPECIES ISSUES. FOR

02:09:47.846 --> 02:09:48.780
TWENTY FIVE YEARS THE

02:09:48.847 --> 02:09:50.215
DEPARTMENT IS LONG OVERDUE IN

02:09:50.282 --> 02:09:52.351
GETTING THE STAFFING- FOR THE

02:09:52.417 --> 02:09:53.819
ENDANGERED SPECIES PROGRAM THEY

02:09:53.886 --> 02:09:55.287
HAVE A FULL TIME AT THE

02:09:55.354 --> 02:09:56.421
DEPARTMENT RIGHT NOW JUST THE

02:09:56.488 --> 02:09:57.589
FULL TIME PEOPLE ONLY DOING

02:09:57.656 --> 02:09:59.892
DANGER SPECIES MY UNDERSTANDING

02:09:59.958 --> 02:10:01.293
FIVE PEOPLE FOR THE ENTIRE

02:10:01.360 --> 02:10:02.661
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT'S

02:10:02.728 --> 02:10:04.830
RIDICULOUS SO WE THINK THAT

02:10:04.897 --> 02:10:06.865
THERE'S DEFINITELY AND OF A

02:10:06.932 --> 02:10:08.634
STRONG CASE TO BE MADE FOR WHAT

02:10:08.700 --> 02:10:09.801
THEY'RE PROPOSING TO FIND THE

02:10:09.868 --> 02:10:11.670
PROBLEM IS FUND SOURCE BECAUSE

02:10:11.737 --> 02:10:13.805
AS YOU WELL NOTED LAST YEAR A

02:10:13.872 --> 02:10:15.374
DEAL CAME TOGETHER TO EXTEND

02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:17.176
THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND

02:10:17.242 --> 02:10:19.278
FOR TEN MORE YEARS. TO WRITE

02:10:19.344 --> 02:10:20.212
THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

02:10:20.279 --> 02:10:22.214
OF GUARANTEED FUNDING FOR

02:10:22.281 --> 02:10:23.949
CONSERVATION IN THE STATE OF

02:10:24.016 --> 02:10:25.617
CALIFORNIA THAT IS MONEY THAT

02:10:25.684 --> 02:10:27.019
GOES TO STATE PARKS THAT'S

02:10:27.085 --> 02:10:28.187
MONEY THAT GOES TO OCEAN THE

02:10:28.253 --> 02:10:29.788
COASTAL CONSERVANCY TAHOE

02:10:29.855 --> 02:10:32.090
CONSERVANCY LOCAL PARK DISTRICT

02:10:32.157 --> 02:10:34.526
GRANTS AND A CHUNK OF MONEY THE

02:10:34.593 --> 02:10:36.295
EIGHTEEN POINT NINE TO THE

02:10:36.361 --> 02:10:38.263
WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD.

02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:38.764
WHO USES THAT MONEY AND

02:10:38.830 --> 02:10:40.232
SOMEONE'S WELL SMALL GRANTS

02:10:40.299 --> 02:10:42.234
AROUND THE STATE WELL THOSE ARE

02:10:42.301 --> 02:10:44.269
MONIES THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY

02:10:44.336 --> 02:10:45.037
IDENTIFIED FOR MOUNTAIN LION

02:10:45.103 --> 02:10:47.806
HABITAT CONSERVE. FOR INLAND

02:10:47.873 --> 02:10:49.942
WETLANDS- ACQUISITION

02:10:50.008 --> 02:10:50.409
CONSISTENT WITH STATES

02:10:50.475 --> 02:10:53.545
OBLIGATION. PART AS PART. FOR A

02:10:53.612 --> 02:10:55.614
LOT FAT WHAT'S YOUR VISION AND-

02:10:55.681 --> 02:10:57.015
VALLEY PRO IMPROVEMENT ACT FOR

02:10:57.082 --> 02:10:58.951
RIGHT CARRYING HABITAT. WE

02:10:59.017 --> 02:11:00.986
DIDN'T GO DOWN THIS PATH OF

02:11:01.053 --> 02:11:01.820
WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

02:11:01.887 --> 02:11:03.188
FISH AND WILDLIFE TO GET

02:11:03.255 --> 02:11:04.656
INCREASED FUNDING. IF IT'S

02:11:04.723 --> 02:11:05.857
GOING TO TURN OUT THAT THEY

02:11:05.924 --> 02:11:06.858
WOULD ESSENTIALLY THE

02:11:06.925 --> 02:11:07.893
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD

02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:09.294
ESSENTIALLY RAID ANOTHER FUN

02:11:09.361 --> 02:11:11.163
SOURCE. AND SHIFT THAT MONEY

02:11:11.230 --> 02:11:12.864
OVER THAT'S YOU KNOW ROBBING

02:11:12.931 --> 02:11:15.601
PETER TO PAY PAUL. SO WE WILL-

02:11:15.667 --> 02:11:16.768
WE BELIEVE THAT THE DEAL WAS A

02:11:16.835 --> 02:11:18.570
DEAL LAST YEAR THE TRAILER BILL

02:11:18.637 --> 02:11:20.305
LANGUAGE SHOULD BE REJECTED.

02:11:20.372 --> 02:11:22.140
BECAUSE IT WOULD ESSENTIALLY

02:11:22.207 --> 02:11:24.309
GOT OUT THE FULL THIRTY MILLION

02:11:24.376 --> 02:11:25.811
DOLLARS A YEAR THAT WE BELIEVED

02:11:25.877 --> 02:11:26.578
WAS GOING TO BE GOING TO THE W.

02:11:26.645 --> 02:11:28.880
C. B. AND THEN IT SAYS. THE DIP

02:11:28.947 --> 02:11:30.916
IN THE BEEN IT DOES NOT PROVIDE

02:11:30.983 --> 02:11:32.551
GUARANTEED FUNDING BECAUSE ONCE

02:11:32.618 --> 02:11:35.554
THE HABITAT CONSERVATION FUND

02:11:35.621 --> 02:11:36.321
IS ELIMINATED. AND GOES AWAY.

02:11:36.388 --> 02:11:37.956
THAT BECOMES NOW GENERAL FUND

02:11:38.023 --> 02:11:39.491
MONEY SO WHATEVER ADDITIONAL

02:11:39.558 --> 02:11:40.626
AUGMENTATION TO GO TO THE

02:11:40.692 --> 02:11:41.260
DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND

02:11:41.326 --> 02:11:43.028
WILDLIFE. THAT'S GENERAL FUND

02:11:43.095 --> 02:11:44.663
MONEY AND AS WE ALL KNOW THAT

02:11:44.730 --> 02:11:46.665
MONEY DISAPPEARS. ANY TIME

02:11:46.732 --> 02:11:47.899
THERE'S AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN

02:11:47.966 --> 02:11:50.168
THAT IS NOT CERTAIN FUNDING AT

02:11:50.235 --> 02:11:51.670
ALL FOR THE DEPARTMENT. SO WE

02:11:51.737 --> 02:11:52.771
BELIEVE THAT THE PROPOSAL

02:11:52.838 --> 02:11:55.107
REALLY VIOLATES THE SPIRIT OF

02:11:55.173 --> 02:11:56.008
THIS SERVICE BASED BUDGETING

AT THIS MOMENT. WE KNOW THIS IS

02:14:43.108 --> 02:14:45.944
JUST THE START- WE NEED AN

UNDOING OF THE EXTENSION WOULD

02:15:52.043 --> 02:15:54.145
ABSOLUTELY MAKE IT EASY FOR

02:15:54.212 --> 02:15:56.081
THAT MONEY TO GO. INTO OTHER

02:15:56.147 --> 02:15:58.750

02:17:35.246 --> 02:17:37.616
STATE. THE DIRECTOR SAID SO

02:17:37.682 --> 02:17:38.984
HIMSELF HE WANTS TO SEE A

02:17:39.050 --> 02:17:40.585
DEPARTMENT THAT. IS FOR ALL

02:17:40.652 --> 02:17:42.621
CALIFORNIANS. UNFORTUNATELY

WHAT WE SEEN OUR LEADS FROM

DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS THAT.

02:17:46.858 --> 02:17:49.494
IT'S EASIER TO SUPPLY A LOT OF

02:17:49.561 --> 02:17:53.365
THE MONEY THAT. WOULD JOB BE

DROP BY IF WATER TABLES FELT

02:58:48.551 --> 02:58:49.752

YOU KNOW A CONTINUE DECLINING

03:00:46.969 --> 03:00:49.205
GROUND WATER LEVELS. WHICH IS

03:00:49.271 --> 03:00:50.906
REALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR THE BIG

03:00:50.973 --> 03:00:53.242
THE COMMUNITIES THAT. ARE

03:00:53.309 --> 03:00:55.144

ABOUT GROUND WATER RECHARGE

03:03:09.511 --> 03:03:11.113
PROJECTS I THINK THERE'S SOME

03:03:11.180 --> 03:03:12.448
BOND FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THAT

03:03:12.514 --> 03:03:14.083

THE THINGS THAT WE FEEL IS VERY

03:05:55.410 --> 03:05:56.945
