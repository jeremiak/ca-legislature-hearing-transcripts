SO I I'LL GO AHEAD AND GET

00:30:00.332 --> 00:30:03.302 region:rollup2
STARTED ABOUT.

00:30:01.133 --> 00:30:05.037 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT HOW

00:30:03.302 --> 00:30:06.872 region:rollup2
ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES

00:30:05.037 --> 00:30:08.140 region:rollup2
AFFECT HEALTH AND WHAT WE CAN DO

00:30:06.872 --> 00:30:10.175 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT.

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:12.010 region:rollup2
I'M THIS WORK STARTED FOR ME

00:30:10.175 --> 00:30:13.945 region:rollup2
MORE THAN A DECADE AGO NOW.

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:15.714 region:rollup2
WHEN I OPENED A CLINIC AND ONE

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:17.249 region:rollup2
OF SAN FRANCISCO'S MOST

00:30:15.714 --> 00:30:18.917 region:rollup2
UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOODS

00:30:17.249 --> 00:30:20.152 region:rollup2
BAYVIEW HUNTERS POINT. OUT WHICH

00:30:18.917 --> 00:30:21.119 region:rollup2
IS A NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:30:20.152 --> 00:30:23.155 region:rollup2
WITH.

00:30:21.119 --> 00:30:25.691 region:rollup2
HIGH NUMBERS OF.

00:30:23.155 --> 00:30:27.159 region:rollup2
AT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IT'S

00:30:25.691 --> 00:30:28.393 region:rollup2
ALSO ABOUT ONE OF THE LOWEST

00:30:27.159 --> 00:30:30.462 region:rollup2
INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN SAN

00:30:28.393 --> 00:30:32.764 region:rollup2
FRANCISCO AND IS A PEDIATRICIAN

00:30:30.462 --> 00:30:33.965 region:rollup2
WHAT I WAS OBSERVING WHAT'S THAT

00:30:32.764 --> 00:30:36.835 region:rollup2
MANY CHILDREN WERE BEING

00:30:33.965 --> 00:30:39.304 region:rollup2
REFERRED TO ME. FOR ADHD OR

00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:39.838 region:rollup2
ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY

00:30:39.304 --> 00:30:41.606 region:rollup2
DISORDER.

00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:43.308 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN I DID A THOROUGH

00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:45.077 region:rollup2
HISTORY AND PHYSICAL WHAT I

00:30:43.308 --> 00:30:46.545 region:rollup2
FOUND WAS THAT FOR MOST OF MY

00:30:45.077 --> 00:30:47.813 region:rollup2
PATIENTS I COULDN'T MAKE A

00:30:46.545 --> 00:30:49.715 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSIS OF STRAIGHTFORWARD

00:30:47.813 --> 00:30:51.283 region:rollup2
ADHD.

00:30:49.715 --> 00:30:52.818 region:rollup2
I AND THE REASON FOR THAT WAS

00:30:51.283 --> 00:30:54.820 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MANY OF MY PATIENTS WERE

00:30:52.818 --> 00:30:57.856 region:rollup2
BEING EXPOSED TWO VERY VERY HIGH

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:59.858 region:rollup2
DOSES OF. ADVERSITY.

00:30:57.856 --> 00:31:01.893 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:03.962 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AT THE TIME

00:31:01.893 --> 00:31:05.497 region:rollup2
IT WITH THE DSM FOUR. THEY

00:31:03.962 --> 00:31:06.732 region:rollup2
SHOWED ALL OF THE SYMPTOMS THAT

00:31:05.497 --> 00:31:09.601 region:rollup2
MY PATIENTS WERE HAPPENING BUT

00:31:06.732 --> 00:31:11.803 region:rollup2
AT THE BOTTOM. IT SAID AND THESE

00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:14.506 region:rollup2
SYMPTOMS ARE NOT CAUSED BY ANY

00:31:11.803 --> 00:31:15.907 region:rollup2
OTHER MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER.

00:31:14.506 --> 00:31:17.642 region:rollup2
NOW I'M NOT A MENTAL HEALTH

00:31:15.907 --> 00:31:19.778 region:rollup2
CONDITION I'M A PEDIATRICIAN BUT

00:31:17.642 --> 00:31:21.380 region:rollup2
MY QUESTION WAS WHAT IF THIS IS

00:31:19.778 --> 00:31:22.981 region:rollup2
BEING CAUSED BY SOME OTHER

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.116 region:rollup2
NEUROLOGIC PROCESS.

00:31:22.981 --> 00:31:25.817 region:rollup2
THAT WASN'T NECESSARILY A MENTAL

00:31:24.116 --> 00:31:27.185 region:rollup2
HEALTH DISORDER.

00:31:25.817 --> 00:31:29.121 region:rollup2
AND AS I.

00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:31.022 region:rollup2
MOVE FORWARD IN MY PRACTICE

00:31:29.121 --> 00:31:32.290 region:rollup2
WHAT I NOTICED THAT IT IT WASN'T

00:31:31.022 --> 00:31:34.359 region:rollup2
JUST CHILDREN'S BEHAVIOR.

00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:37.162 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION WHAT WE WERE SEEING

00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:39.064 region:rollup2
UP WAS FOR EXAMPLE AS I WAS

00:31:37.162 --> 00:31:40.899 region:rollup2
MANAGING A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL

00:31:39.064 --> 00:31:42.100 region:rollup2
WITH ASTHMA AND I WAS GOING

00:31:40.899 --> 00:31:43.802 region:rollup2
THROUGH HER ASTHMA TRIGGERS AND

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:46.171 region:rollup2
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE

00:31:43.802 --> 00:31:47.706 region:rollup2
DOING A GOOD JOB OF. NOT

00:31:46.171 --> 00:31:49.441 region:rollup2
PREVENTING HER ASTHMA.

00:31:47.706 --> 00:31:51.042 region:rollup2
I AS I ASKED HER MOM YOU KNOW

00:31:49.441 --> 00:31:52.210 region:rollup2
WHAT DO YOU NOTICE THAT TRIGGERS

00:31:51.042 --> 00:31:54.413 region:rollup2
YOUR DAUGHTER'S ASTHMA BECAUSE

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:55.046 region:rollup2
WE HAD DONE KIND OF ALL OF THE

00:31:54.413 --> 00:31:56.982 region:rollup2
STANDARD PRECAUTION.

00:31:55.046 --> 00:31:58.750 region:rollup2
PRECAUTIONS

00:31:56.982 --> 00:32:00.285 region:rollup2
SHE SAID TO ME. YOU KNOW LOOK

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:02.387 region:rollup2
TOWARD TOWN I NOTICED THAT MY

00:32:00.285 --> 00:32:04.189 region:rollup2
DAUGHTER'S ASTHMA TENDS TO ACT

00:32:02.387 --> 00:32:06.291 region:rollup2
UP EVERYTIME HER DAD PUNCHES A

00:32:04.189 --> 00:32:09.161 region:rollup2
HOLE IN THE WALL.

00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:10.128 region:rollup2
AND FOR ME THAT WAS REALLY WHAT

00:32:09.161 --> 00:32:11.797 region:rollup2
GOT ME INTO LOOKING AT THE

00:32:10.128 --> 00:32:14.666 region:rollup2
SCIENCE ABOUT HOW EARLY

00:32:11.797 --> 00:32:16.835 region:rollup2
ADVERSITY. GETS UNDER OUR SKIN

00:32:14.666 --> 00:32:18.069 region:rollup2
AND CHANGES OUR BIOLOGY AND THAT

00:32:16.835 --> 00:32:19.237 region:rollup2
IS WHAT HAS LED ME TO THE

00:32:18.069 --> 00:32:20.739 region:rollup2
ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES

00:32:19.237 --> 00:32:21.239 region:rollup2
STUDY.

00:32:20.739 --> 00:32:23.675 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:32:21.239 --> 00:32:25.644 region:rollup2
FOR FOLKS WHO MAY NOT BE

00:32:23.675 --> 00:32:27.045 region:rollup2
FAMILIAR OUTSIDE THE ADVERSE

00:32:25.644 --> 00:32:28.747 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES STUDY WAS

00:32:27.045 --> 00:32:30.215 region:rollup2
CONDUCTED NOW TWO DECADES AGO IT

00:32:28.747 --> 00:32:32.317 region:rollup2
WAS PUBLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY

00:32:30.215 --> 00:32:34.519 region:rollup2
EIGHT. AND IT WAS A CONDUCTED IN

00:32:32.317 --> 00:32:35.487 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THAT CENTERS

00:32:34.519 --> 00:32:36.688 region:rollup2
FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND

00:32:35.487 --> 00:32:38.223 region:rollup2
PREVENTION THE CDC AND KAISER

00:32:36.688 --> 00:32:39.691 region:rollup2
PERMANENTE A.

00:32:38.223 --> 00:32:41.860 region:rollup2
AND IN IT THEY ASKED SEVENTEEN

00:32:39.691 --> 00:32:43.462 region:rollup2
AND A HALF THOUSAND ADULTS

00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.930 region:rollup2
ABOUT THEIR HISTORIES OF WHAT

00:32:43.462 --> 00:32:46.631 region:rollup2
THEY CALLED ADVERSE CHILDHOOD

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:48.066 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES.

00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:50.569 region:rollup2
AND THESE INCLUDE PHYSICAL

00:32:48.066 --> 00:32:52.904 region:rollup2
EMOTIONAL OR SEXUAL ABUSE

00:32:50.569 --> 00:32:54.272 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL NEGLECT

00:32:52.904 --> 00:32:55.974 region:rollup2
OR GROWING UP IN A HOUSEHOLD

00:32:54.272 --> 00:32:57.309 region:rollup2
WHERE PARENT WAS MENTALLY ILL

00:32:55.974 --> 00:32:58.944 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCE THE PENDANT

00:32:57.309 --> 00:33:00.478 region:rollup2
INCARCERATED WITH WITH PARENTAL

00:32:58.944 --> 00:33:01.913 region:rollup2
SEPARATION OR DIVORCE. OR

00:33:00.478 --> 00:33:03.715 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

00:33:01.913 --> 00:33:05.884 region:rollup2
AND FOR EVERY YES

00:33:03.715 --> 00:33:07.552 region:rollup2
AN INDIVIDUAL WOULD GET A POINT

00:33:05.884 --> 00:33:08.320 region:rollup2
ON THEIR A SCORE FOR EACH ONE OF

00:33:07.552 --> 00:33:10.121 region:rollup2
THESE CATEGORIES THAT THEY HAD

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.523 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED.

00:33:10.121 --> 00:33:13.191 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THEY FOUND IN THIS

00:33:11.523 --> 00:33:14.125 region:rollup2
STUDY WAS REALLY GROUNDBREAKING

00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:16.027 region:rollup2
AND THERE WERE TWO IMPORTANT

00:33:14.125 --> 00:33:18.029 region:rollup2
THINGS.

00:33:16.027 --> 00:33:20.832 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE WAS THAT.

00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:23.768 region:rollup2
ACES ARE INCREDIBLY COMMON

00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:25.971 region:rollup2
AND THIS REALLY DEFY IT I THINK

00:33:23.768 --> 00:33:28.874 region:rollup2
NOT PREVIOUS COMMON WITH THEM

00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:31.176 region:rollup2
THAT. I CHILDHOOD ADVERSITY ONLY

00:33:28.874 --> 00:33:32.277 region:rollup2
HAPPENS TO CERTAIN PEOPLE IN

00:33:31.176 --> 00:33:33.578 region:rollup2
CERTAIN POPULATIONS.

00:33:32.277 --> 00:33:34.813 region:rollup2
THIS STUDY WAS DONE IN A

00:33:33.578 --> 00:33:36.781 region:rollup2
POPULATION THAT WAS SEVENTY

00:33:34.813 --> 00:33:38.516 region:rollup2
PERCENT CAUCASIAN SEVENTY

00:33:36.781 --> 00:33:40.285 region:rollup2
PERCENT COLLEGE EDUCATED TWO

00:33:38.516 --> 00:33:41.152 region:rollup2
THIRDS OF THE STUDY PARTICIPANT

00:33:40.285 --> 00:33:43.755 region:rollup2
HAD AT LEAST ONE ADVERSE

00:33:41.152 --> 00:33:45.323 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE. AND TWELVE

00:33:43.755 --> 00:33:47.492 region:rollup2
POINT SIX PERCENT ONE IN EIGHT

00:33:45.323 --> 00:33:49.494 region:rollup2
FOLKS HAD FOUR OR MORE ADVERSE

00:33:47.492 --> 00:33:51.630 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES.

00:33:49.494 --> 00:33:53.031 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA OUR DATA SHOWS

00:33:51.630 --> 00:33:54.366 region:rollup2
THAT EIGHTY SAYS DO NOT

00:33:53.031 --> 00:33:56.234 region:rollup2
DISCRIMINATE BY RACE OR

00:33:54.366 --> 00:33:58.904 region:rollup2
ETHNICITY IS FOUND IN EVERY

00:33:56.234 --> 00:34:01.139 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND EVERY POPULATION.

00:33:58.904 --> 00:34:03.708 region:rollup2
AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:34:01.139 --> 00:34:06.144 region:rollup2
ALMOST SEVENTEEN PERCENT OF

00:34:03.708 --> 00:34:10.282 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS HAVE FOUR OR MORE

00:34:06.144 --> 00:34:11.716 region:rollup2
ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES.

00:34:10.282 --> 00:34:13.451 region:rollup2
THE SECOND FINDING FROM THE

00:34:11.716 --> 00:34:16.988 region:rollup2
ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES

00:34:13.451 --> 00:34:18.757 region:rollup2
pWAS THIS VERY STRONG

00:34:16.988 --> 00:34:21.359 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP WHAT THEY.

00:34:18.757 --> 00:34:22.394 region:rollup2
I'VE FOUND WITH A DOSE RESPONSE

00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:23.828 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP

00:34:22.394 --> 00:34:26.865 region:rollup2
BETWEEN ADVERSE CHILDHOOD

00:34:23.828 --> 00:34:29.100 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES AND HEALTH OUTCOMES.

00:34:26.865 --> 00:34:30.201 region:rollup2
SO FOR A PERSON WHO HAS FOUR OR

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.736 region:rollup2
MORE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD

00:34:30.201 --> 00:34:33.438 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES.

00:34:31.736 --> 00:34:35.140 region:rollup2
THEIR RISK FOR ISCHEMIC HEART

00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:37.075 region:rollup2
DISEASE THE NUMBER ONE KILLER IN

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:38.443 region:rollup2
THE UNITED STATES IS DOUBLE.

00:34:37.075 --> 00:34:39.911 region:rollup2
AS COMPARED TO SOMEONE WITH AN A

00:34:38.443 --> 00:34:41.346 region:rollup2
SCORE OF ZERO.

00:34:39.911 --> 00:34:42.914 region:rollup2
HERE WE HAVE A LISTS OF THE TEN

00:34:41.346 --> 00:34:44.449 region:rollup2
LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH IN THE

00:34:42.914 --> 00:34:46.518 region:rollup2
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. AND

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:48.486 region:rollup2
HAVING AND A SCORE OF FOUR OR

00:34:46.518 --> 00:34:51.423 region:rollup2
MORE IS ASSOCIATED WITH A

00:34:48.486 --> 00:34:53.425 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC INCREASE IN SEVEN OUT

00:34:51.423 --> 00:34:54.759 region:rollup2
OF TEN OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF

00:34:53.425 --> 00:34:57.195 region:rollup2
DEATH IN THE UNITED STATES OF

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:59.331 region:rollup2
AMERICA.

00:34:57.195 --> 00:35:00.832 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE UNDERSTAND.

00:34:59.331 --> 00:35:02.968 region:rollup2
THIS

00:35:00.832 --> 00:35:05.370 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE THAT A SAYS ARE

00:35:02.968 --> 00:35:06.771 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY COMMON A NUMBER TWO

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:08.573 region:rollup2
THERE'S A VERY STRONG

00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:11.176 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A SAYS. AN

00:35:08.573 --> 00:35:13.044 region:rollup2
ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES

00:35:11.176 --> 00:35:14.312 region:rollup2
THE NEXT UP IS UNDERSTANDING HOW

00:35:13.044 --> 00:35:16.014 region:rollup2
THIS HAPPENS WHAT IS THE

00:35:14.312 --> 00:35:17.549 region:rollup2
MECHANISM BECAUSE WHEN WE

00:35:16.014 --> 00:35:20.185 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISM WE CAN

00:35:17.549 --> 00:35:23.121 region:rollup2
USE THAT SCIENCE FOR. TO TO

00:35:20.185 --> 00:35:25.190 region:rollup2
DISRUPT THAT PROCESS.

00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:26.491 region:rollup2
AND BIO WHEN THE ORIGINAL

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:28.960 region:rollup2
RESEARCHERS FIRST PUBLISHED

00:35:26.491 --> 00:35:30.695 region:rollup2
THEIR DATA MANY FOLKS THOUGHT OF

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.763 region:rollup2
COURSE THIS MAKES SENSE.

00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:33.798 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A ROUGH CHILDHOOD

00:35:31.763 --> 00:35:35.800 region:rollup2
YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO DRINK AND

00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:37.068 region:rollup2
SMOKE AND DO ALL THE THINGS THAT

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:39.371 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO RUIN YOUR HEALTH.

00:35:37.068 --> 00:35:41.272 region:rollup2
REALLY THIS IS NOT SO MUCH ABOUT

00:35:39.371 --> 00:35:42.807 region:rollup2
HEALTHCARE OR MEDICINE THIS IS

00:35:41.272 --> 00:35:45.644 region:rollup2
REALLY ABOUT BEHAVIOR.

00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:47.812 region:rollup2
BUT FORTUNATELY THERE SOME VERY

00:35:45.644 --> 00:35:48.747 region:rollup2
RIGOROUS SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:50.815 region:rollup2
DONE THE EVALUATION TO DEBUNK

00:35:48.747 --> 00:35:52.484 region:rollup2
THAT MYTH

00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:55.053 region:rollup2
WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IS THAT.

00:35:52.484 --> 00:35:56.855 region:rollup2
PORTION OF THE RISK IS DUE TO

00:35:55.053 --> 00:35:57.722 region:rollup2
HEALTH RISK BEHAVIOR.

00:35:56.855 --> 00:35:58.890 region:rollup2
AND I'M GONNA PUT A LITTLE

00:35:57.722 --> 00:35:59.991 region:rollup2
ASTERISK THERE BECAUSE I'M GONNA

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:01.893 region:rollup2
COME BACK TO IT.

00:35:59.991 --> 00:36:03.194 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN IF YOU DON'T ENGAGE IN

00:36:01.893 --> 00:36:04.529 region:rollup2
ANY HIGH RISK BEHAVIOR EVEN IF

00:36:03.194 --> 00:36:06.197 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T DRINK OR SMOKE YOU'RE

00:36:04.529 --> 00:36:08.299 region:rollup2
NOT IN ACTIVE YOU DON'T EAT JUNK

00:36:06.197 --> 00:36:09.834 region:rollup2
FOOD. YOU'RE STILL AT GREATER

00:36:08.299 --> 00:36:12.370 region:rollup2
RISK FOR DEVELOPING HEART

00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:14.906 region:rollup2
DISEASE COPD CANCER DIABETES

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:16.474 region:rollup2
THAT SARAH. AND THE REASON FOR

00:36:14.906 --> 00:36:19.344 region:rollup2
THAT IS BECAUSE.

00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:22.680 region:rollup2
OF A MECHANISM THAT WE NOW KNOW.

00:36:19.344 --> 00:36:23.915 region:rollup2
CALLED TOXIC.

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:26.017 region:rollup2
AND ESSENTIALLY IT ALL BOILS

00:36:23.915 --> 00:36:27.952 region:rollup2
DOWN TO OUR BODY'S BIOLOGICAL

00:36:26.017 --> 00:36:28.987 region:rollup2
FIGHTER FLIGHT RESPONSE.

00:36:27.952 --> 00:36:30.689 region:rollup2
AND IT WORKS A LITTLE SOMETHING

00:36:28.987 --> 00:36:31.856 region:rollup2
LIKE THIS IMAGINE YOU'RE WALKING

00:36:30.689 --> 00:36:32.691 region:rollup2
IN A FOREST.

00:36:31.856 --> 00:36:34.526 region:rollup2
AND YOU SEE THIS GUY

00:36:32.691 --> 00:36:36.061 region:rollup2
RIGHT.

00:36:34.526 --> 00:36:37.996 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR BRAINS AND

00:36:36.061 --> 00:36:39.397 region:rollup2
BODIES ARE BRAIN SENDS A SIGNAL

00:36:37.996 --> 00:36:41.199 region:rollup2
TO OUR BODIES TO RELEASE STRESS

00:36:39.397 --> 00:36:43.168 region:rollup2
HORMONES?

00:36:41.199 --> 00:36:45.136 region:rollup2
AND THE STRESS HORMONES PERFORM

00:36:43.168 --> 00:36:46.571 region:rollup2
SOME VERY IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS

00:36:45.136 --> 00:36:49.374 region:rollup2
THE INCREASE OUR BLOOD PRESSURE

00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:50.241 region:rollup2
THEY INCREASE OUR BLOOD SUGAR.

00:36:49.374 --> 00:36:52.077 region:rollup2
THEY.

00:36:50.241 --> 00:36:53.978 region:rollup2
SPEED UP OUR HEART RATE THEY

00:36:52.077 --> 00:36:56.815 region:rollup2
DILATE ARE PUPIL THINK OPEN UP

00:36:53.978 --> 00:36:58.249 region:rollup2
OUR AIRWAYS SO THAT WE ARE READY

00:36:56.815 --> 00:36:59.584 region:rollup2
TO EITHER FIGHT THAT BEAR. OR

00:36:58.249 --> 00:37:02.220 region:rollup2
RUN FROM THE PAIR.

00:36:59.584 --> 00:37:03.221 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S GOOD.

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:04.522 region:rollup2
BUT FOR MOST OF US IF WE WERE

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:06.758 region:rollup2
THINK TO THINK ABOUT FIGHTING A

00:37:04.522 --> 00:37:08.693 region:rollup2
BEAR RIGHT IT WOULDN'T SEEM LIKE

00:37:06.758 --> 00:37:10.161 region:rollup2
A GOOD IDEA AND THAT IS WHY THE

00:37:08.693 --> 00:37:11.362 region:rollup2
AMYGDALA THE PART OF THE BRAIN

00:37:10.161 --> 00:37:12.464 region:rollup2
THAT ACTIVATES THAT FEAR

00:37:11.362 --> 00:37:14.866 region:rollup2
RESPONSE.

00:37:12.464 --> 00:37:16.468 region:rollup2
SENSE PROJECTIONS TO THE PART OF

00:37:14.866 --> 00:37:17.869 region:rollup2
OUR BRAIN THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:37:16.468 --> 00:37:20.805 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING IMPULSE

00:37:17.869 --> 00:37:22.574 region:rollup2
CONTROL. AND LEARNING THE

00:37:20.805 --> 00:37:23.975 region:rollup2
PREFRONTAL CORTEX AND IT TURNS

00:37:22.574 --> 00:37:25.543 region:rollup2
IT WAY DOWN

00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:27.278 region:rollup2
RAIN BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT

00:37:25.543 --> 00:37:29.547 region:rollup2
IMPULSE CONTROL GETTING IN THE

00:37:27.278 --> 00:37:31.049 region:rollup2
WAY OF SURVIVAL.

00:37:29.547 --> 00:37:32.517 region:rollup2
AND THE FINAL THING THAT HAPPENS

00:37:31.049 --> 00:37:34.486 region:rollup2
IN THE BODY WHEN OUR WHEN WE

00:37:32.517 --> 00:37:36.421 region:rollup2
ACTIVATE OUR STRESS RESPONSE

00:37:34.486 --> 00:37:38.356 region:rollup2
IS THAT IT ALSO ACTIVATES OUR

00:37:36.421 --> 00:37:40.358 region:rollup2
IMMUNE RESPONSE.

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:42.193 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF WE ARE IN A FOREST

00:37:40.358 --> 00:37:43.795 region:rollup2
AND IF THERE IS A BEAR.

00:37:42.193 --> 00:37:46.464 region:rollup2
IF THAT BEAR GETS ITS CLAWS INTO

00:37:43.795 --> 00:37:49.634 region:rollup2
US WE WANT OUR IMMUNE SYSTEM TO

00:37:46.464 --> 00:37:51.536 region:rollup2
BE PRIMED TO BRING INFLAMMATION

00:37:49.634 --> 00:37:54.439 region:rollup2
TO STABILIZE THAT WOUND. SO THAT

00:37:51.536 --> 00:37:56.975 region:rollup2
WE CAN EITHER. I.

00:37:54.439 --> 00:37:59.677 region:rollup2
LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO TAG BEAT

00:37:56.975 --> 00:38:02.514 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ARE OR GET AWAY.

00:37:59.677 --> 00:38:04.415 region:rollup2
THIS SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED OVER.

00:38:02.514 --> 00:38:06.684 region:rollup2
MILLENNIUM TO SAVE OUR LIVES

00:38:04.415 --> 00:38:09.120 region:rollup2
FROM A MORTAL THREAT.

00:38:06.684 --> 00:38:10.255 region:rollup2
BUT THE PROBLEM IS WHAT HAPPENS

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.190 region:rollup2
WHEN THAT BEAR COMES HOME EVERY

00:38:10.255 --> 00:38:14.659 region:rollup2
NIGHT.

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:17.896 region:rollup2
AND THIS BIOLOGICAL PROCESS.

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:19.931 region:rollup2
IS ACTIVATED OVER AND OVER AND

00:38:17.896 --> 00:38:21.699 region:rollup2
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

00:38:19.931 --> 00:38:23.701 region:rollup2
AND IT GOES FROM BEING ADAPTIVE

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:24.636 region:rollup2
OR LIFESAVING.

00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:26.704 region:rollup2
TO MALADAPTIVE OR HEALTH

00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:29.073 region:rollup2
DAMAGING.

00:38:26.704 --> 00:38:32.010 region:rollup2
AND WHEN CHILDREN ARE EXPOSED TO

00:38:29.073 --> 00:38:34.145 region:rollup2
HIGH DOSES OF ADVERSITY.

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:35.680 region:rollup2
THE RESULT IS LONG TERM CHANGES

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:37.749 region:rollup2
TO THE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.185 region:rollup2
CHILDREN'S BRAINS.

00:38:37.749 --> 00:38:42.120 region:rollup2
OVER ACTIVITY OF THIS FIGHT OR

00:38:40.185 --> 00:38:44.656 region:rollup2
FLIGHT RESPONSE AND DIFFICULTY

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:46.491 region:rollup2
TURNING THIS RESPONSE OFF.

00:38:44.656 --> 00:38:48.927 region:rollup2
CHANGES TO AND I'LL COME BACK TO

00:38:46.491 --> 00:38:50.528 region:rollup2
THE ASTROCYTE MENTIONED EARLIER.

00:38:48.927 --> 00:38:51.896 region:rollup2
CHANGES TO CERTAIN PARTS OF THE

00:38:50.528 --> 00:38:53.865 region:rollup2
BRAIN INCLUDING THE VENTRAL

00:38:51.896 --> 00:38:55.567 region:rollup2
TEGMENTAL AREA AND THE NUCLEUS

00:38:53.865 --> 00:38:56.167 region:rollup2
ACCUMBENS. LEAD TO INCREASED

00:38:55.567 --> 00:38:58.736 region:rollup2
RISK

00:38:56.167 --> 00:39:00.371 region:rollup2
OF.

00:38:58.736 --> 00:39:02.373 region:rollup2
DEPENDENCE OR.

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:04.409 region:rollup2
INCREASED RISK OF ENGAGING IN

00:39:02.373 --> 00:39:05.643 region:rollup2
HIGH RISK BEHAVIOR BECAUSE THEY

00:39:04.409 --> 00:39:08.213 region:rollup2
ARE CHANGES TO THE STRUCTURE AND

00:39:05.643 --> 00:39:09.847 region:rollup2
FUNCTION OF THE PLEASURE AND

00:39:08.213 --> 00:39:11.716 region:rollup2
REWARD CENTER OF THE BRAIN.

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:13.251 region:rollup2
WE ALSO SEE LONG TERM CHANGES TO

00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:14.919 region:rollup2
THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. TO OUR

00:39:13.251 --> 00:39:16.988 region:rollup2
HORMONAL SYSTEMS

00:39:14.919 --> 00:39:18.623 region:rollup2
AND EVEN TO WEIGH EVEN TO THE

00:39:16.988 --> 00:39:20.925 region:rollup2
WAY OUR DNA IS RED AND

00:39:18.623 --> 00:39:23.127 region:rollup2
TRANSCRIBED AND THIS IS WHAT

00:39:20.925 --> 00:39:26.564 region:rollup2
LEADS TO THE LIFELONG CHANGES

00:39:23.127 --> 00:39:29.534 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH TOXIC.

00:39:26.564 --> 00:39:31.569 region:rollup2
SO NOW THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT

00:39:29.534 --> 00:39:32.537 region:rollup2
EARLY LIFE ADVERSITY FILTERED

00:39:31.569 --> 00:39:35.073 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE LENS OF BOTH

00:39:32.537 --> 00:39:36.908 region:rollup2
PROTECTIVE FACTORS AS WELL AS

00:39:35.073 --> 00:39:38.977 region:rollup2
PREDISPOSED VULNERABILITY. LEADS

00:39:36.908 --> 00:39:40.912 region:rollup2
TO CHANGES WITH OUR IT IT TO A

00:39:38.977 --> 00:39:42.413 region:rollup2
CHILD'S ENTIRE DEVELOPING BRAIN

00:39:40.912 --> 00:39:43.881 region:rollup2
AND BODY.

00:39:42.413 --> 00:39:45.216 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS WHAT LEADS TO THE

00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:46.117 region:rollup2
LONG TERM HEALTH OUTCOMES

00:39:45.216 --> 00:39:48.052 region:rollup2
WE CAN USE THE SCIENCE

00:39:46.117 --> 00:39:48.786 region:rollup2
TO.

00:39:48.052 --> 00:39:50.755 region:rollup2
CHANGE OUR PRACTICES FOR OUR

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:52.957 region:rollup2
CHILD.

00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:55.093 region:rollup2
.

00:39:52.957 --> 00:39:57.328 region:rollup2
THE FIRST THING IS UNDERSTANDING

00:39:55.093 --> 00:40:00.131 region:rollup2
THAT SIGNS OF TOXIC STRESS ARE

00:39:57.328 --> 00:40:01.966 region:rollup2
DETECTABLE AS EARLY AS INFANCY.

00:40:00.131 --> 00:40:02.533 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL

00:40:01.966 --> 00:40:05.036 region:rollup2
SOMEONE.

00:40:02.533 --> 00:40:05.937 region:rollup2
UP MOVES INTO THEIR FORTIES AND

00:40:05.036 --> 00:40:08.406 region:rollup2
FIFTIES AND DEVELOP

00:40:05.937 --> 00:40:10.008 region:rollup2
CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE OR CANCER

00:40:08.406 --> 00:40:12.176 region:rollup2
OR CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY

00:40:10.008 --> 00:40:13.077 region:rollup2
DISEASE BEFORE WE CAN BEGIN TO

00:40:12.176 --> 00:40:16.247 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT.

00:40:13.077 --> 00:40:18.616 region:rollup2
REMEDIES FOR THIS ISSUE WE CAN

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:20.084 region:rollup2
BEGIN TO RECOGNIZE SIGNS AND

00:40:18.616 --> 00:40:21.953 region:rollup2
SYMPTOMS OF TOXIC STRESSED AS

00:40:20.084 --> 00:40:24.188 region:rollup2
EARLY AS INFANCY BUT IN ORDER

00:40:21.953 --> 00:40:25.290 region:rollup2
FOR US TO DO THAT WE NEED TO BE

00:40:24.188 --> 00:40:28.026 region:rollup2
ABLE TO.

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:28.593 region:rollup2
TRAIN EVERY PROVIDER ON

00:40:28.026 --> 00:40:30.194 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WHAT DOES THAT

00:40:28.593 --> 00:40:31.663 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE.

00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:32.697 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE FIRST LEARNED ABOUT

00:40:31.663 --> 00:40:34.065 region:rollup2
THE SCIENCE OF MY CLINICAL

00:40:32.697 --> 00:40:36.000 region:rollup2
PRACTICE ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS

00:40:34.065 --> 00:40:37.735 region:rollup2
THAT WE DID WAS WE WENT AND DID

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.237 region:rollup2
A CHART REVIEW OF ALL OF OUR

00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:41.339 region:rollup2
PATIENTS TO UNDERSTAND.

00:40:39.237 --> 00:40:42.907 region:rollup2
WHAT WERE THEIR A SCORES LIKE

00:40:41.339 --> 00:40:45.143 region:rollup2
THE WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT VERY

00:40:42.907 --> 00:40:46.277 region:rollup2
SIMILAR TO THE KAISER STUDY TWO

00:40:45.143 --> 00:40:48.079 region:rollup2
THIRDS OF OUR PATIENTS HAVE

00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:49.414 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED AT LEAST ONE ADVERSE

00:40:48.079 --> 00:40:52.016 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE?

00:40:49.414 --> 00:40:54.552 region:rollup2
AND ONE IT AND TWELVE PERCENT

00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:55.386 region:rollup2
HAD EXPERIENCE FOR ARM OR MORE.

00:40:54.552 --> 00:40:58.256 region:rollup2
NOW THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR

00:40:55.386 --> 00:41:00.358 region:rollup2
POPULATION WITH THAT RATHER THAN

00:40:58.256 --> 00:41:01.492 region:rollup2
IT BEING AN ADULT POPULATION

00:41:00.358 --> 00:41:02.460 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS BEING ASKED WHICH OF

00:41:01.492 --> 00:41:03.828 region:rollup2
THESE THINGS HAPPEN TO YOU WHEN

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:05.830 region:rollup2
YOU WERE A CHILD.

00:41:03.828 --> 00:41:09.701 region:rollup2
THE MEDIAN AGE OF OUR PATIENTS

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:10.968 region:rollup2
WITH EIGHT YEARS OLD.

00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:12.770 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT FOR

00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:13.604 region:rollup2
OUR PATIENTS WHO HAD FOUR OR

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:14.972 region:rollup2
MORE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:17.108 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES.

00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:19.177 region:rollup2
THEY WERE TWICE AS LIKELYTO BE

00:41:17.108 --> 00:41:21.279 region:rollup2
OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE.

00:41:19.177 --> 00:41:22.714 region:rollup2
AND THIRTY TWO POINT SIX TIMES

00:41:21.279 --> 00:41:24.082 region:rollup2
AS LIKELY.

00:41:22.714 --> 00:41:25.650 region:rollup2
TO HAVE LEARNING OR BEHAVIOR

00:41:24.082 --> 00:41:28.019 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS IN SCHOOL.

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:30.655 region:rollup2
AND WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR DATA.

00:41:28.019 --> 00:41:32.190 region:rollup2
FOR OUR KIDS WITH ZERO A SAYS

00:41:30.655 --> 00:41:33.758 region:rollup2
ONLY THREE PERCENT OF THEM HAD

00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:35.793 region:rollup2
LEARNING AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS

00:41:33.758 --> 00:41:37.762 region:rollup2
AND KIDS A IN SCHOOL. AND FOR

00:41:35.793 --> 00:41:39.497 region:rollup2
OUR KIDS WITH FOUR OR MORE ACES

00:41:37.762 --> 00:41:40.798 region:rollup2
FIFTY ONE POINT TWO PERCENT MORE

00:41:39.497 --> 00:41:42.500 region:rollup2
THAN HALF OF THEM HAD LEARNING

00:41:40.798 --> 00:41:43.568 region:rollup2
AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.837 region:rollup2
THIS HAS SIGNIFICANT

00:41:43.568 --> 00:41:47.839 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS FOR EVERY PROVIDER

00:41:45.837 --> 00:41:49.741 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:51.175 region:rollup2
WHO IS CURRENTLY. UP

00:41:49.741 --> 00:41:51.976 region:rollup2
TREATING KIDS WHO ARE BEING

00:41:51.175 --> 00:41:53.544 region:rollup2
PRESENTED TO THAT WITH

00:41:51.976 --> 00:41:55.079 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS.

00:41:53.544 --> 00:41:57.448 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW MOST OF THESE CHILDREN

00:41:55.079 --> 00:42:00.284 region:rollup2
ARE BEING MISDIAGNOSED AS HAVING

00:41:57.448 --> 00:42:00.752 region:rollup2
ADHD WITHOUT THE ROOT CAUSE OF

00:42:00.284 --> 00:42:03.187 region:rollup2
EARLY ADVERSITY BEING

00:42:00.752 --> 00:42:04.922 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZED.

00:42:03.187 --> 00:42:07.091 region:rollup2
AND THE MOST COMMON TREATMENT

00:42:04.922 --> 00:42:08.192 region:rollup2
FOR FOR ATTENTION DEFICIT

00:42:07.091 --> 00:42:10.395 region:rollup2
HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER. IF

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:13.731 region:rollup2
STIMULANTS.

00:42:10.395 --> 00:42:15.800 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:17.468 region:rollup2
TO PROVIDE BETTER QUALITY OF

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.836 region:rollup2
CARE MORE APPROPRIATE CARE TO

00:42:17.468 --> 00:42:20.405 region:rollup2
OUR KIDS.

00:42:18.836 --> 00:42:22.840 region:rollup2
AND RIGHT NOW TEACHERS ACROSS

00:42:20.405 --> 00:42:25.143 region:rollup2
OUR STATE ARE BEING ASKED TO

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:27.645 region:rollup2
EDUCATE KIDS WHO ARE BEING

00:42:25.143 --> 00:42:30.848 region:rollup2
EXPOSED TO A NEUROTOXIN AND IT'S

00:42:27.645 --> 00:42:32.550 region:rollup2
SIMPLY UNFAIR WE WOULD NOT. WE

00:42:30.848 --> 00:42:35.486 region:rollup2
CANNOT ASK TEACHERS TO BE

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:37.221 region:rollup2
DOCTORS TO CURE TOXIC STRESS

00:42:35.486 --> 00:42:39.157 region:rollup2
WHAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS

00:42:37.221 --> 00:42:42.160 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE TO GIVE OUR

00:42:39.157 --> 00:42:43.961 region:rollup2
EDUCATORS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO TO

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.596 region:rollup2
OUR.

00:42:43.961 --> 00:42:48.099 region:rollup2
WORK WITH KIDS WHO ARE GETTING

00:42:45.596 --> 00:42:49.801 region:rollup2
THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT

00:42:48.099 --> 00:42:52.003 region:rollup2
FOR TOXIC STRESS WHICH IS TO

00:42:49.801 --> 00:42:54.038 region:rollup2
REDUCE THEIR DOSE OF ADVERSITY

00:42:52.003 --> 00:42:54.806 region:rollup2
AND ENHANCE THE BUFFERING

00:42:54.038 --> 00:42:57.775 region:rollup2
CAPACITY OF THE CAREGIVERS AND

00:42:54.806 --> 00:42:59.777 region:rollup2
THEIR ENVIRONMENT.

00:42:57.775 --> 00:43:02.013 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE KNOW NOW.

00:42:59.777 --> 00:43:03.681 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT WE LOOK AT

00:43:02.013 --> 00:43:06.551 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

00:43:03.681 --> 00:43:08.453 region:rollup2
WE CAN IMPROVE OUTCOMES WITH

00:43:06.551 --> 00:43:08.886 region:rollup2
ROUTINE SCREENING EARLY

00:43:08.453 --> 00:43:10.955 region:rollup2
DETECTION AND EARLY

00:43:08.886 --> 00:43:13.024 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION.

00:43:10.955 --> 00:43:14.592 region:rollup2
I AT THIS

00:43:13.024 --> 00:43:16.394 region:rollup2
OUR MY ORGANIZATION THE CENTER

00:43:14.592 --> 00:43:18.262 region:rollup2
FOR YOUTH WELL LET'S HAS WORKED

00:43:16.394 --> 00:43:20.097 region:rollup2
WITH PROVIDERS FROM ACROSS THE

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:21.999 region:rollup2
COUNTRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE

00:43:20.097 --> 00:43:22.867 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST BARRIERS TO BEING

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:23.835 region:rollup2
ABLE TO SCREEN FOR ADVERSE

00:43:22.867 --> 00:43:25.536 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AS PART OF

00:43:23.835 --> 00:43:27.772 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE.

00:43:25.536 --> 00:43:30.141 region:rollup2
AND ARE ONE TWO AND THREE

00:43:27.772 --> 00:43:31.142 region:rollup2
BARRIERS ARE TIME.

00:43:30.141 --> 00:43:32.443 region:rollup2
FOLKS DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN

00:43:31.142 --> 00:43:34.946 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A POSITIVE SCREEN AND

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:36.814 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T GET REIMBURSED FOR.

00:43:34.946 --> 00:43:38.883 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE A SCREENING TOOL TO

00:43:36.814 --> 00:43:41.152 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO SCREEN QUICKLY AND

00:43:38.883 --> 00:43:43.354 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY. FOR RISK FACTORS OF

00:43:41.152 --> 00:43:43.888 region:rollup2
TOXIC STRESS IN PRIMARY CARE

00:43:43.354 --> 00:43:45.356 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE DONE IN THREE

00:43:43.888 --> 00:43:46.791 region:rollup2
MINUTES OR LESS

00:43:45.356 --> 00:43:48.793 region:rollup2
WE TWENTY ENHANCE OUR PROTECTIVE

00:43:46.791 --> 00:43:50.862 region:rollup2
FACTORS AND THEN WE NEED TO DO

00:43:48.793 --> 00:43:52.630 region:rollup2
THIS INTERVENTION. BOTH IN THE

00:43:50.862 --> 00:43:54.599 region:rollup2
CLINICAL SETTING AND IN THE

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:55.933 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND ALSO YOUR BRIEF

00:43:54.599 --> 00:43:57.802 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE OF WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE

00:43:55.933 --> 00:43:59.570 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE WRAP UP.

00:43:57.802 --> 00:44:01.606 region:rollup2
SO IN OUR CLINICAL SETTING UP

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:03.975 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THIS IS THE GROWTH

00:44:01.606 --> 00:44:06.477 region:rollup2
CHART OF A PATIENT THAT I CARED

00:44:03.975 --> 00:44:07.979 region:rollup2
FOR. WHO WITH EXPERIENCING

00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:09.714 region:rollup2
FAILURE TO THRIVE AND IF YOU

00:44:07.979 --> 00:44:12.383 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THOSE LITTLE DOTS AS

00:44:09.714 --> 00:44:14.352 region:rollup2
THEY FALL BELOW THAT THE LIGHT

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:16.521 region:rollup2
PART OF THE GRAPH THIS IS A

00:44:14.352 --> 00:44:19.223 region:rollup2
CHILD WHO LITERALLY?

00:44:16.521 --> 00:44:21.759 region:rollup2
HAD GROWTH IMPAIRMENT SHE WAS

00:44:19.223 --> 00:44:23.895 region:rollup2
NOT GAINING WEIGHT OR HEIGHT.

00:44:21.759 --> 00:44:25.196 region:rollup2
AND.

00:44:23.895 --> 00:44:26.964 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIS IS A CHILD WHO HAD

00:44:25.196 --> 00:44:28.499 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY BEEN THIS THIS GROWTH

00:44:26.964 --> 00:44:30.568 region:rollup2
CHART IT'S FROM HER PREVIOUS

00:44:28.499 --> 00:44:32.470 region:rollup2
PEDIATRICIAN.

00:44:30.568 --> 00:44:34.639 region:rollup2
THIS YOUNG UP GIRL CAME TO SEE

00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:36.741 region:rollup2
ME AFTER HER PARA ACT HER FAMILY

00:44:34.639 --> 00:44:38.075 region:rollup2
MOVED TO OUR COMMUNITY.

00:44:36.741 --> 00:44:40.211 region:rollup2
AND AS PART OF HER REGULAR

00:44:38.075 --> 00:44:40.878 region:rollup2
TREATMENT WE ACTUALLY SCREEN HER

00:44:40.211 --> 00:44:42.547 region:rollup2
FOR ADVERSE CHILDHOOD

00:44:40.878 --> 00:44:45.182 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES.

00:44:42.547 --> 00:44:46.717 region:rollup2
HER A SCORE FOR THIS.

00:44:45.182 --> 00:44:48.519 region:rollup2
ALMOST THREE YEAR OLD CHILD WITH

00:44:46.717 --> 00:44:49.820 region:rollup2
A SEVEN SHE HAD EXPERIENCED

00:44:48.519 --> 00:44:51.088 region:rollup2
SEVEN OUT OF TEN OF THE ACES

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:52.823 region:rollup2
THAT I TALKED ABOUT.

00:44:51.088 --> 00:44:54.892 region:rollup2
BUT WHEN WE IMPLEMENTED TRAUMA

00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:56.594 region:rollup2
INFORMED CARE AND IN OUR CASE WE

00:44:54.892 --> 00:44:58.095 region:rollup2
HAD INTEGRATED PRIMARY CARE AND

00:44:56.594 --> 00:44:59.430 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH.

00:44:58.095 --> 00:45:00.698 region:rollup2
THIS CHILD WHO HAD BEEN TREATED

00:44:59.430 --> 00:45:01.999 region:rollup2
WITH ONLY WITH NUTRITIONAL

00:45:00.698 --> 00:45:03.234 region:rollup2
SUPPLEMENTATION WHICH IS

00:45:01.999 --> 00:45:05.036 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO BE THE STANDARD OF

00:45:03.234 --> 00:45:06.304 region:rollup2
CARE FOR FAILURE TO THRIVE WHO

00:45:05.036 --> 00:45:08.072 region:rollup2
HADN'T BEEN GROWING. FOR OVER A

00:45:06.304 --> 00:45:09.340 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:45:08.072 --> 00:45:12.176 region:rollup2
WHEN WE DID.

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:13.811 region:rollup2
ACES INFORMS TREATMENT.

00:45:12.176 --> 00:45:15.680 region:rollup2
WITHIN SIX MONTHS SHE WAS BACK

00:45:13.811 --> 00:45:18.683 region:rollup2
ON THE GROWTH CHARTS.

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:20.284 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION IN THE COMMUNITY

00:45:18.683 --> 00:45:22.453 region:rollup2
WHAT WE SEE IS THAT.

00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:24.088 region:rollup2
MORE AND MORE COMMUNITY BASED

00:45:22.453 --> 00:45:26.591 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS ARE BEGINNING TO

00:45:24.088 --> 00:45:29.260 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT INTERVENTION THAT IS

00:45:26.591 --> 00:45:31.329 region:rollup2
ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:34.031 region:rollup2
STRESS RESPONSE ENHANCE

00:45:31.329 --> 00:45:35.399 region:rollup2
BUFFERING CAPACITIES AND AT WITH

00:45:34.031 --> 00:45:37.568 region:rollup2
INTERVENTIONS LIKE SLEEP.

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:38.569 region:rollup2
EXERCISE NUTRITION MINDFULNESS

00:45:37.568 --> 00:45:40.104 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALTHY

00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:42.173 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP.

00:45:40.104 --> 00:45:44.141 region:rollup2
AND AS AN EXAMPLE SAN FRANCISCO

00:45:42.173 --> 00:45:45.643 region:rollup2
UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT JOHN

00:45:44.141 --> 00:45:47.245 region:rollup2
O'CONNELL HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN

00:45:45.643 --> 00:45:48.813 region:rollup2
ALSO A JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL

00:45:47.245 --> 00:45:50.348 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED A MINDFULNESS

00:45:48.813 --> 00:45:51.749 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION WITH THE GOAL OF

00:45:50.348 --> 00:45:53.251 region:rollup2
CALMING THIS OVER ACTIVE STRESS

00:45:51.749 --> 00:45:54.418 region:rollup2
RESPONSE.

00:45:53.251 --> 00:45:57.321 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS A

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:58.456 region:rollup2
REDUCTION IN SCHOOL VIOLENCE.

00:45:57.321 --> 00:46:00.725 region:rollup2
A SUBSTANTIAL DROP IN THE

00:45:58.456 --> 00:46:02.426 region:rollup2
SUSPENSION RATE.

00:46:00.725 --> 00:46:04.061 region:rollup2
AN INCREASE IN GPA.

00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:05.963 region:rollup2
AN INCREASE AND COMPOSITE STAR

00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:08.132 region:rollup2
TEST SCORES.

00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:10.001 region:rollup2
AND MY FAVORITE DECREASE

00:46:08.132 --> 00:46:13.204 region:rollup2
PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AMONG

00:46:10.001 --> 00:46:15.539 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATORS AND TEACHERS OVER

00:46:13.204 --> 00:46:17.508 region:rollup2
THE COURSE OF THE INTERVENTION.

00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:20.144 region:rollup2
HAVING A TRAUMA INFORMED

00:46:17.508 --> 00:46:23.381 region:rollup2
FRAMEWORK KNOWING WHAT WE ARE

00:46:20.144 --> 00:46:25.383 region:rollup2
TREATING KNOWING THAT WE CAN.

00:46:23.381 --> 00:46:28.052 region:rollup2
WITH ROUTINE SCREENING EARLY

00:46:25.383 --> 00:46:28.919 region:rollup2
DETECTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION

00:46:28.052 --> 00:46:30.955 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY

00:46:28.919 --> 00:46:34.892 region:rollup2
FOR.

00:46:30.955 --> 00:46:36.894 region:rollup2
MILLIONS OF OUR CHILDREN.

00:46:34.892 --> 00:46:39.497 region:rollup2
IS AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL

00:46:36.894 --> 00:46:42.867 region:rollup2
POWERFUL WAY FOR US TO USE THE

00:46:39.497 --> 00:46:44.368 region:rollup2
SCIENCE TO IMPROVE HEALTH.

00:46:42.867 --> 00:46:45.703 region:rollup2
AND LIFE OUTCOMES

00:46:44.368 --> 00:46:47.038 region:rollup2
CHILDREN ACROSS OUR STATE.

WHEN THEY LEARNED THAT I JUST

00:47:33.951 --> 00:47:36.721 region:rollup2
FOLLOWED NAY DEEMED BURKE

00:47:34.485 --> 00:47:37.621 region:rollup2

UNIVERSITY CENTER FOR PULP FOR

00:47:40.224 --> 00:47:43.127 region:rollup2
POVERTY RESEARCH.

00:47:42.259 --> 00:47:44.729 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE OTHER HAT THAT I

00:47:43.127 --> 00:47:46.397 region:rollup2
WEAR IS I'M CURRENTLY PRESIDENT

00:47:44.729 --> 00:47:48.065 region:rollup2

THE HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT OF OUR

00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:53.270 region:rollup2
YOUNGEST CHILDREN AND THEIR

00:47:52.103 --> 00:47:54.705 region:rollup2
FAMILIES AND I VERY MUCH

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:57.108 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:57.775 region:rollup2
SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. I I WILL NOT

00:47:57.108 --> 00:47:59.543 region:rollup2
HAVE POWER POINT SLIDES IN ORDER

00:47:57.775 --> 00:48:00.544 region:rollup2
TO AVERT THE WORST TENDENCIES OF

00:47:59.543 --> 00:48:02.113 region:rollup2
AN ACADEMIC.

00:48:00.544 --> 00:48:03.280 region:rollup2
BUT I WILL SAY THAT IN ORDER TO

00:48:02.113 --> 00:48:04.682 region:rollup2
MAKE UP FOR THAT I THINK YOU

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.218 region:rollup2
HAVE A COUPLE OF ARTICLES THAT I

00:48:04.682 --> 00:48:09.353 region:rollup2
HAD SENT ON FRIDAY. RELATING TO

00:48:07.218 --> 00:48:10.788 region:rollup2
CHILDREN IN STRESS AND SOME OF

00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:12.289 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC POLICY AVENUES THAT

00:48:10.788 --> 00:48:13.057 region:rollup2
CAN HELP TO ADDRESS THAT

00:48:12.289 --> 00:48:16.060 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE AND.

00:48:13.057 --> 00:48:17.495 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT IS THE SUBSTITUTE

00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:18.796 region:rollup2
FOR FOR POWER POINTS PERHAPS.

00:48:17.495 --> 00:48:20.564 region:rollup2
THE RESEARCH PRESENTED BY A BY

00:48:18.796 --> 00:48:22.032 region:rollup2
DOCTOR HARRIS CONCERNING ADVERSE

00:48:20.564 --> 00:48:23.567 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES OF THEIR

00:48:22.032 --> 00:48:24.702 region:rollup2
LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES

00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:26.470 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH IS

00:48:24.702 --> 00:48:28.405 region:rollup2
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT.

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:30.274 region:rollup2
IT DRAWS OUR ATTENTION AGAIN TO

00:48:28.405 --> 00:48:31.442 region:rollup2
THE WAYS IN WHICH EARLY

00:48:30.274 --> 00:48:33.811 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE COULD HAVE A PROFOUND

00:48:31.442 --> 00:48:35.713 region:rollup2
LEGACY FOR LIFELONG DEVELOPMENT.

00:48:33.811 --> 00:48:37.047 region:rollup2
AND IT COINCIDES WITH RESEARCH

00:48:35.713 --> 00:48:38.249 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL RESEARCH THAT

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:39.683 region:rollup2
FOLLOWS CHILDREN FROM VERY EARLY

00:48:38.249 --> 00:48:41.419 region:rollup2
IN LIFE.

00:48:39.683 --> 00:48:42.653 region:rollup2
I ANY EXPERIENCES THEY HAVE AND

00:48:41.419 --> 00:48:43.921 region:rollup2
LOOKS AT WHAT ARE THE LONG TERM

00:48:42.653 --> 00:48:45.356 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES FOLLOWING FROM THOSE

00:48:43.921 --> 00:48:46.724 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES.

00:48:45.356 --> 00:48:47.758 region:rollup2
AS ONE OF STUDY SOCIAL AND

00:48:46.724 --> 00:48:49.360 region:rollup2
EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF VERY

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:50.928 region:rollup2
YOUNG CHILDREN BEGINNING AS

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:52.096 region:rollup2
EARLY A SIX MONTHS OF AGE AND

00:48:50.928 --> 00:48:53.230 region:rollup2
WORKS TO PROMOTE YOUNG

00:48:52.096 --> 00:48:54.865 region:rollup2
CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH DURING

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:55.900 region:rollup2
THE EARLY YEARS OF LIFE.

00:48:54.865 --> 00:48:57.268 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE ARE THREE MESSAGES

00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:58.369 region:rollup2
FROM CURRENT RESEARCH THAT I

00:48:57.268 --> 00:49:00.171 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO DOCTOR

00:48:58.369 --> 00:49:00.971 region:rollup2
HARRIS'S COMMENTS.

00:49:00.171 --> 00:49:03.040 region:rollup2
AND THE FIRST OF THEM IS ONE

00:49:00.971 --> 00:49:03.741 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ALLUDED TO BRIEFLY THAT

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:05.376 region:rollup2
I THINK WE NEED TO DEEPEN A

00:49:03.741 --> 00:49:06.710 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT ON. WHICH IS THAT

00:49:05.376 --> 00:49:08.512 region:rollup2
RESEARCH UP EARLY DEVELOPMENT IS

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:09.580 region:rollup2
SHOWING THE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC

00:49:08.512 --> 00:49:10.781 region:rollup2
STRESS IT IF YOUNGER AND YOUNGER

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.416 region:rollup2
AGES.

00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:13.884 region:rollup2
BOB I'VE LITERALLY BEEN IN THE

00:49:12.416 --> 00:49:18.022 region:rollup2
POSITION OF WATCHING HOW PSALM

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:19.256 region:rollup2
THE THE THRESHOLD FOR THE ON. OF

00:49:18.022 --> 00:49:21.459 region:rollup2
OUR ABILITY TO DETECT

00:49:19.256 --> 00:49:23.127 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT ELEMENTS OF CHRONIC

00:49:21.459 --> 00:49:24.929 region:rollup2
STRESS IS MOVING IT EARLIER AND

00:49:23.127 --> 00:49:25.930 region:rollup2
EARLIER AGES.

00:49:24.929 --> 00:49:27.097 region:rollup2
THERE NOW NEW STUDIES USING

00:49:25.930 --> 00:49:29.133 region:rollup2
NEURO IMAGING METHODS AND

00:49:27.097 --> 00:49:30.634 region:rollup2
CORTISOL ATTACHES ALSACE

00:49:29.133 --> 00:49:32.169 region:rollup2
SHOWING HOW THE BIOLOGICALLY

00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:34.305 region:rollup2
DISRUPTIVE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC

00:49:32.169 --> 00:49:35.472 region:rollup2
STRESS CAN BE SEEN AS EARLY AS

00:49:34.305 --> 00:49:36.607 region:rollup2
THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE. NOT JUST

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:38.809 region:rollup2
INFANCY.

00:49:36.607 --> 00:49:39.743 region:rollup2
THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE.

00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:41.779 region:rollup2
WITH AFFECTS BOTH ON BRAIN

00:49:39.743 --> 00:49:43.647 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONING.

00:49:41.779 --> 00:49:44.582 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO AND BRAIN STRUCTURE.

00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:45.382 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN OBSERVE THROUGH

00:49:44.582 --> 00:49:47.384 region:rollup2
IMAGING STUDIES

00:49:45.382 --> 00:49:48.919 region:rollup2
SIMPLY PUT.

00:49:47.384 --> 00:49:49.820 region:rollup2
JUST AS WE HAVE LONG KNOWN THE

00:49:48.919 --> 00:49:51.689 region:rollup2
BRAIN DEVELOPMENT SHAPED BY

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:52.957 region:rollup2
EARLY EXPERIENCE WE ARE NOW

00:49:51.689 --> 00:49:55.025 region:rollup2
SEEING THE PROFOUND EFFECTS OF

00:49:52.957 --> 00:49:56.527 region:rollup2
EARLY STRESS ON HOW THE BRAIN

00:49:55.025 --> 00:49:59.063 region:rollup2
DEVELOPS AND FUNCTIONS.

00:49:56.527 --> 00:50:01.065 region:rollup2
AS EARLY AS THE FIRST YEAR.

00:49:59.063 --> 00:50:02.533 region:rollup2
EQUALLY IMPORTANTLY I THINK.

00:50:01.065 --> 00:50:03.634 region:rollup2
OF CONCERN TO TO THOSE OF US WHO

00:50:02.533 --> 00:50:04.802 region:rollup2
STUDY YOUNG CHILDREN IS THAT

00:50:03.634 --> 00:50:06.303 region:rollup2
THESE BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF

00:50:04.802 --> 00:50:07.838 region:rollup2
CHRONIC STRESS.

00:50:06.303 --> 00:50:09.240 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN LINKED TO HOW TO TO

00:50:07.838 --> 00:50:11.141 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES IN HOW CHILDREN

00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:12.510 region:rollup2
LEARN AND HOW THEY DEVELOP.

00:50:11.141 --> 00:50:14.211 region:rollup2
ONE STUDY SHOWED FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:15.746 region:rollup2
BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES IN BRAIN

00:50:14.211 --> 00:50:17.181 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE EMERGING DURING THE

00:50:15.746 --> 00:50:18.616 region:rollup2
EARLY YEARS.

00:50:17.181 --> 00:50:20.184 region:rollup2
HELP TO ACCOUNT FOR THE LOWER

00:50:18.616 --> 00:50:21.785 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT TEST SCORES IN

00:50:20.184 --> 00:50:23.187 region:rollup2
PRESCHOOL CHILDREN EXPERIENCING

00:50:21.785 --> 00:50:26.156 region:rollup2
CHRONIC STRESS

00:50:23.187 --> 00:50:27.191 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO THEIR PEERS.

00:50:26.156 --> 00:50:28.392 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO GROWING EVIDENCE A

00:50:27.191 --> 00:50:29.393 region:rollup2
CHRONIC STRESS CAN HELP EVEN

00:50:28.392 --> 00:50:30.961 region:rollup2
EARLIER AFFECTS.

00:50:29.393 --> 00:50:33.130 region:rollup2
IN EFFECT.

00:50:30.961 --> 00:50:34.398 region:rollup2
BEFORE CHILDREN ARE BORN.

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:36.100 region:rollup2
STUDIES OF INFANTS BORN TO

00:50:34.398 --> 00:50:37.301 region:rollup2
MOTHERS WHO EXPERIENCED PERSON

00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:39.270 region:rollup2
STRESS DURING THEIR PREGNANCIES

00:50:37.301 --> 00:50:40.504 region:rollup2
REVEAL THAT IS NEW PARTS THESE

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:42.206 region:rollup2
CHILDREN ARE THEMSELVES MORE

00:50:40.504 --> 00:50:43.574 region:rollup2
EMOTIONALLY REACTIVE INSENSITIVE

00:50:42.206 --> 00:50:44.742 region:rollup2
TO STRESS.

00:50:43.574 --> 00:50:45.910 region:rollup2
WITH FOLLOW UP STUDIES SHOWING

00:50:44.742 --> 00:50:47.544 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE MORE VULNERABLE

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:49.513 region:rollup2
TO EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS

00:50:47.544 --> 00:50:52.016 region:rollup2
DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS

00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:53.784 region:rollup2
IN CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE.

00:50:52.016 --> 00:50:55.920 region:rollup2
THE PRENATAL AFFECTS A MATERNAL

00:50:53.784 --> 00:50:56.887 region:rollup2
STRESS ON THE DEVELOPING FETUS.

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:59.857 region:rollup2
WHAT HAS COME TO BE KNOWN IN THE

00:50:56.887 --> 00:51:01.425 region:rollup2
FIELD AS FETAL PROGRAMMING?

00:50:59.857 --> 00:51:02.393 region:rollup2
IT'S ANOTHER INDICATION OF HOW

00:51:01.425 --> 00:51:04.328 region:rollup2
MUCH THE CHILD'S RAPIDLY

00:51:02.393 --> 00:51:04.795 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING BIOLOGICAL AND

00:51:04.328 --> 00:51:05.930 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL SYSTEMS ARE

00:51:04.795 --> 00:51:07.731 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE.

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:09.133 region:rollup2
T. INFLUENCES SUCH AS STRESSORS

00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:11.201 region:rollup2
EARLY IN DEVELOPMENT EVEN BEFORE

00:51:09.133 --> 00:51:12.970 region:rollup2
A CHILD IS BORN.

00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:14.505 region:rollup2
SO THE ASUS STUDY IS CONSISTENT

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:16.340 region:rollup2
WITH OTHER RESEARCH SHOWING HOW

00:51:14.505 --> 00:51:17.741 region:rollup2
THE STRESSES OF ALL KINDS CAN

00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:19.510 region:rollup2
HAVE EARLY IN AND DURING THE

00:51:17.741 --> 00:51:20.377 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON DEVELOPMENT. WITH

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:22.413 region:rollup2
GREATER AFFECTS THE YOUNGER THE

00:51:20.377 --> 00:51:23.347 region:rollup2
CHILD.

00:51:22.413 --> 00:51:25.482 region:rollup2
BUT I NEED TO SAY THAT THERE'S A

00:51:23.347 --> 00:51:27.351 region:rollup2
SILVER LINING TO THIS DARK CLOUD

00:51:25.482 --> 00:51:29.086 region:rollup2
OF EARLY VULNERABILITY.

00:51:27.351 --> 00:51:30.554 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE SAME BIOLOGICAL AND

00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:31.722 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL SYSTEMS THAT ARE SO

00:51:30.554 --> 00:51:33.190 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE TO THE EFFECTS OF

00:51:31.722 --> 00:51:35.626 region:rollup2
EARLY STRESS.

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:36.627 region:rollup2
ARE ALSO CAPABLE OF REMEDIATION

00:51:35.626 --> 00:51:38.262 region:rollup2
IF THE SOURCES OF STRESS ARE

00:51:36.627 --> 00:51:40.264 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED INDUSTRY

00:51:38.262 --> 00:51:41.832 region:rollup2
THE EDITOR AND ADDRESS.

00:51:40.264 --> 00:51:42.933 region:rollup2
THROUGH EARLY IDENTIFICATION AND

00:51:41.832 --> 00:51:44.868 region:rollup2
TREATMENT THE BRAINS

00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:46.203 region:rollup2
MALLEABILITY OR PLASTICITY IS WE

00:51:44.868 --> 00:51:48.138 region:rollup2
CALL.

00:51:46.203 --> 00:51:49.139 region:rollup2
COMPARE ALLY IN HELPING TO SHIFT

00:51:48.138 --> 00:51:50.708 region:rollup2
THE ODDS TOWARD MORE HEALTHY

00:51:49.139 --> 00:51:51.308 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

00:51:50.708 --> 00:51:53.243 region:rollup2
I'LL BE TURNING TO THAT LITTLE

00:51:51.308 --> 00:51:54.945 region:rollup2
BIT LATER.

00:51:53.243 --> 00:51:56.613 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING SOURCES OF EARLY

00:51:54.945 --> 00:51:58.482 region:rollup2
STRESS REALLY LEADS TO MY SECOND

00:51:56.613 --> 00:52:00.718 region:rollup2
CONCLUSION AND IT IS THIS.

00:51:58.482 --> 00:52:02.753 region:rollup2
THERE ARE MORE SOURCES OF TOXIC

00:52:00.718 --> 00:52:05.122 region:rollup2
STRESS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN THEN

00:52:02.753 --> 00:52:06.824 region:rollup2
FOR OLDER CHILDREN AND ADULTS.

00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:08.726 region:rollup2
AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE TERM

00:52:06.824 --> 00:52:10.227 region:rollup2
TOXIC STRESSING AND WHERE CAN

00:52:08.726 --> 00:52:11.161 region:rollup2
COME FROM FOR CHILDREN WE

00:52:10.227 --> 00:52:12.663 region:rollup2
NATURALLY THINK OF THE

00:52:11.161 --> 00:52:14.131 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES THAT HARM OR

00:52:12.663 --> 00:52:16.500 region:rollup2
THREATEN. OR TERRORIZE

00:52:14.131 --> 00:52:17.434 region:rollup2
I TRAUMATIZE THEM.

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.103 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THE STRESSES THAT

00:52:17.434 --> 00:52:20.270 region:rollup2
ATTRACTED THE ASUS STUDIES SUCH

00:52:19.103 --> 00:52:21.572 region:rollup2
AS PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL OR SEXUAL

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:22.973 region:rollup2
ABUSE

00:52:21.572 --> 00:52:24.775 region:rollup2
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SUBSTANCE

00:52:22.973 --> 00:52:26.744 region:rollup2
ABUSE OR MENTAL ILLNESS IN THE

00:52:24.775 --> 00:52:27.845 region:rollup2
HOME. PARENTS SEPARATION OR

00:52:26.744 --> 00:52:29.413 region:rollup2
DIVORCE OR EMOTIONAL OR PHYSICAL

00:52:27.845 --> 00:52:30.948 region:rollup2
NEGLECT.

00:52:29.413 --> 00:52:32.383 region:rollup2
IT IS IMPORTANT FOR RECOGNIZE

00:52:30.948 --> 00:52:34.284 region:rollup2
THAT THE STRESS IS LIKE THESE

00:52:32.383 --> 00:52:35.552 region:rollup2
ARE MORE PREVALENT AMONG THE

00:52:34.284 --> 00:52:37.688 region:rollup2
YOUNGEST CHILDREN THAN FOR ANY

00:52:35.552 --> 00:52:38.989 region:rollup2
OLDER AGE GROUP.

00:52:37.688 --> 00:52:40.424 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR EXAMPLE

00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:41.892 region:rollup2
NEARLY ONE QUARTER OF CHILDREN

00:52:40.424 --> 00:52:43.027 region:rollup2
AGED THREE AND UNDER LIVED IN

00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:44.261 region:rollup2
POVERTY.

00:52:43.027 --> 00:52:45.295 region:rollup2
AND AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY THREE

00:52:44.261 --> 00:52:47.264 region:rollup2
PERCENT LIVED IN POOR FAMILY

00:52:45.295 --> 00:52:49.133 region:rollup2
HOUSEHOLDS.

00:52:47.264 --> 00:52:49.867 region:rollup2
THESE PROPORTIONS ARE HIGHER FOR

00:52:49.133 --> 00:52:51.535 region:rollup2
YOUNGER CHILDREN LIVING IN

00:52:49.867 --> 00:52:52.903 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:52:51.535 --> 00:52:55.005 region:rollup2
WHICH MEANS HAD MORE THAN HALF

00:52:52.903 --> 00:52:56.673 region:rollup2
OF CHILDREN AGED THREE AND BELOW

00:52:55.005 --> 00:52:58.542 region:rollup2
LIVE IN FAMILIES AND ECONOMIC

00:52:56.673 --> 00:53:00.110 region:rollup2
DIFFICULTY IN OUR STATE NOW. THE

00:52:58.542 --> 00:53:01.045 region:rollup2
REASON I MENTION POVERTY.

00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:02.513 region:rollup2
IS THAT FOR THOSE OF US WHO

00:53:01.045 --> 00:53:04.114 region:rollup2
STUDY THE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC

00:53:02.513 --> 00:53:06.750 region:rollup2
STRESS ON YOUNG CHILDREN POVERTY

00:53:04.114 --> 00:53:08.252 region:rollup2
BECOMES THE EGO TO TEST CASE.

00:53:06.750 --> 00:53:09.920 region:rollup2
BECAUSE A COMBINED SO MANY

00:53:08.252 --> 00:53:11.789 region:rollup2
SOURCES OF STRESS ALL IN ONE FOR

00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:12.956 region:rollup2
YOUNG CHILDREN.

00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:14.858 region:rollup2
IT MEANS THAT YOU NOT ONLY ARE

00:53:12.956 --> 00:53:16.460 region:rollup2
IN A SITUATION OF ON FOOD

00:53:14.858 --> 00:53:18.028 region:rollup2
INSECURITY AND HOUSING

00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:19.663 region:rollup2
INSTABILITY YOUR PARENTS WERE

00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:20.764 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES STRESSED.

00:53:19.663 --> 00:53:22.332 region:rollup2
AND MAY HAVE OTHER DIFFICULTIES

00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:24.568 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.

00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:26.103 region:rollup2
SO POVERTY IS A SOURCE OF TOXIC

00:53:24.568 --> 00:53:27.671 region:rollup2
STRESS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN AND

00:53:26.103 --> 00:53:29.540 region:rollup2
THE YOUNGER THE CHILD THE MORE

00:53:27.671 --> 00:53:31.341 region:rollup2
LIKELY YOU ARE TO BE LIVING IN A

00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:32.943 region:rollup2
LOWER INCOME SETTING.

00:53:31.341 --> 00:53:33.977 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT JUST POVERTY MORE

00:53:32.943 --> 00:53:35.813 region:rollup2
THAN ONE THIRD OF THE VICTIMS OF

00:53:33.977 --> 00:53:37.114 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIATED CHILD MALTREATMENT

00:53:35.813 --> 00:53:38.649 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIFTEEN WERE CHILDREN

00:53:37.114 --> 00:53:39.917 region:rollup2
UNDER THE AGE OF THREE. AND

00:53:38.649 --> 00:53:41.218 region:rollup2
VICTIMIZATION RATE WAS HIGHER

00:53:39.917 --> 00:53:43.053 region:rollup2
FOR INFANTS UNDER ONE YEAR OF

00:53:41.218 --> 00:53:44.788 region:rollup2
AGE.

00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:46.190 region:rollup2
SO SAY IT AGAIN THE YOUNGER YOU

00:53:44.788 --> 00:53:47.691 region:rollup2
ARE THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO

00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:50.461 region:rollup2
BE LIVING IN CONDITIONS

00:53:47.691 --> 00:53:51.328 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH TOXIC STRESS.

00:53:50.461 --> 00:53:53.163 region:rollup2
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS A

00:53:51.328 --> 00:53:55.065 region:rollup2
VIEWS EXPERIENCES ONLY CAPTURE

00:53:53.163 --> 00:53:56.867 region:rollup2
PART OF THE NATURE OF TOXIC

00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:57.935 region:rollup2
STRESS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN.

00:53:56.867 --> 00:53:59.536 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY DEPEND SO

00:53:57.935 --> 00:54:00.771 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY ON ADULTS TO

00:53:59.536 --> 00:54:02.406 region:rollup2
PROVIDE PROTECTION AND

00:54:00.771 --> 00:54:04.708 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE CARE.

00:54:02.406 --> 00:54:05.876 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES CAN ALSO BE TOXIC TO

00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:07.611 region:rollup2
YOUNG CHILDREN WHEN THEY INVOLVE

00:54:05.876 --> 00:54:07.811 region:rollup2
A DEPRIVATION OR WITHDRAWAL OF

00:54:07.611 --> 00:54:09.880 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:11.281 region:rollup2
CARE.

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:12.716 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHY CHILD EMOTIONAL

00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:14.751 region:rollup2
NEGLECT IS INCLUDED AMONG THE

00:54:12.716 --> 00:54:16.653 region:rollup2
ACES AS WELL AS PARENT MENTAL

00:54:14.751 --> 00:54:18.489 region:rollup2
HEALTH PROBLEMS LIKE DEPRESSION.

00:54:16.653 --> 00:54:18.956 region:rollup2
AND HERE AGAIN THE YOUNGEST

00:54:18.489 --> 00:54:20.657 region:rollup2
CHILDREN ARE THE MOST

00:54:18.956 --> 00:54:21.825 region:rollup2
VULNERABLE.

00:54:20.657 --> 00:54:23.260 region:rollup2
MOTHERS HAVE MORE THAN ONE IN

00:54:21.825 --> 00:54:24.528 region:rollup2
SEVEN INFANTS WILL EXPERIENCE

00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:25.996 region:rollup2
MAJOR DEPRESSION IN THEIR

00:54:24.528 --> 00:54:27.498 region:rollup2
CHILD'S FIRST YEAR AND THIS

00:54:25.996 --> 00:54:28.999 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN DIRECTLY

00:54:27.498 --> 00:54:30.567 region:rollup2
TIED TO CHANGES IN THE BABY'S

00:54:28.999 --> 00:54:31.869 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING BRAIN.

00:54:30.567 --> 00:54:33.303 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHEN WE THINK OF TOXIC

00:54:31.869 --> 00:54:35.005 region:rollup2
STRESS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN WE

00:54:33.303 --> 00:54:36.640 region:rollup2
HAVE TO CONSIDER A BROADER RANGE

00:54:35.005 --> 00:54:38.509 region:rollup2
OF EXPERIENCES THAN WE

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:40.344 region:rollup2
ORDINARILY CONSIDER FOR AN OLDER

00:54:38.509 --> 00:54:41.278 region:rollup2
CHILD OR AN ADULT.

00:54:40.344 --> 00:54:42.913 region:rollup2
CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF THREE OR

00:54:41.278 --> 00:54:45.816 region:rollup2
FOUR HAVING TO FACE STRESSFUL

00:54:42.913 --> 00:54:47.751 region:rollup2
SPIRIT EXPERIENCES ALONE WITHOUT

00:54:45.816 --> 00:54:48.952 region:rollup2
SUPPORT IS TOXIC.

00:54:47.751 --> 00:54:53.423 region:rollup2
BEEN DEPRIVED OF NURTURING

00:54:48.952 --> 00:54:55.592 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE CARE IT'S TOXIC.

00:54:53.423 --> 00:54:57.694 region:rollup2
MY LAST CONCLUSION FROM CURRENT

00:54:55.592 --> 00:54:58.962 region:rollup2
RESEARCH ADDRESSES INTERVENTION.

00:54:57.694 --> 00:55:00.764 region:rollup2
THE EFFECTS OF EARLY STRESSES

00:54:58.962 --> 00:55:02.166 region:rollup2
ARE BEST ADDRESSED.

00:55:00.764 --> 00:55:03.767 region:rollup2
THROUGH A COMBINATION OF

00:55:02.166 --> 00:55:05.302 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT BEGIN WITH EARLY

00:55:03.767 --> 00:55:07.137 region:rollup2
IDENTIFICATION BUT WHICH

00:55:05.302 --> 00:55:08.505 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE CHILDREN

00:55:07.137 --> 00:55:10.974 region:rollup2
AND THOSE WHO CARE FOR THEM AS

00:55:08.505 --> 00:55:12.643 region:rollup2
THE CHILD DEVELOPS.

00:55:10.974 --> 00:55:14.278 region:rollup2
BOB PERHAPS THE BEST WAY OF

00:55:12.643 --> 00:55:16.580 region:rollup2
EXPRESSING THIS IS TO STATE WHAT

00:55:14.278 --> 00:55:17.548 region:rollup2
I'M SAYING IN THE NEGATIVE.

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:19.149 region:rollup2
EARLY IDENTIFICATION IS

00:55:17.548 --> 00:55:21.084 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND ESSENTIAL

00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:22.186 region:rollup2
BUT WE CANNOT STOP THEIR. WE

00:55:21.084 --> 00:55:23.287 region:rollup2
ALSO NEED TO INTERVENE

00:55:22.186 --> 00:55:25.556 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY TO ADDRESS THE

00:55:23.287 --> 00:55:26.957 region:rollup2
SOURCES OF STRESS.

00:55:25.556 --> 00:55:28.559 region:rollup2
AN INTERVENTION FOCUS OF THE

00:55:26.957 --> 00:55:29.893 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING CHILD IS IMPORTANT

00:55:28.559 --> 00:55:31.228 region:rollup2
AND ESSENTIAL BUT WE CANNOT STOP

00:55:29.893 --> 00:55:32.529 region:rollup2
THEIR.

00:55:31.228 --> 00:55:33.730 region:rollup2
WE ALSO NEED TO PROVIDE

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:35.399 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE TO THE CHILD'S

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:36.633 region:rollup2
CAREGIVERS ON HOME THE CHILD

00:55:35.399 --> 00:55:38.368 region:rollup2
DEPENDS FOR NURTURANCE AND

00:55:36.633 --> 00:55:39.670 region:rollup2
PROTECTION TO HELP THEM BE

00:55:38.368 --> 00:55:41.138 region:rollup2
SOURCES OF RELIABLE SUPPORT IF

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:43.106 region:rollup2
WE CAN'T.

00:55:41.138 --> 00:55:44.608 region:rollup2
FINALLY INTERVENING EARLY IS

00:55:43.106 --> 00:55:46.510 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND ESSENTIAL BUT WE

00:55:44.608 --> 00:55:48.278 region:rollup2
CAN'T STOP THERE. WE NEED A

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:50.280 region:rollup2
SYSTEM OF CONTINUING SUPPORT TO

00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:51.315 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SEAMLESS AND ONGOING

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:53.784 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE AS THE CHILDREN ARE

00:55:51.315 --> 00:55:55.152 region:rollup2
HEALING.

00:55:53.784 --> 00:55:56.687 region:rollup2
NOW WHAT I JUST DESCRIBED YOUR

00:55:55.152 --> 00:55:57.955 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF

00:55:56.687 --> 00:55:59.256 region:rollup2
INFINITE EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL

00:55:57.955 --> 00:56:01.258 region:rollup2
HEALTH.

00:55:59.256 --> 00:56:01.859 region:rollup2
YES

00:56:01.258 --> 00:56:03.527 region:rollup2
THERE IS A FIELD INFANT MENTAL

00:56:01.859 --> 00:56:04.461 region:rollup2
HEALTH.

00:56:03.527 --> 00:56:05.996 region:rollup2
AND IT DOES NOT CONSIST OF

00:56:04.461 --> 00:56:07.931 region:rollup2
BABIES LYING ON A COUCH RELATING

00:56:05.996 --> 00:56:10.033 region:rollup2
THEIR PROBLEMS TO A PSYCHIATRIST

00:56:07.931 --> 00:56:11.001 region:rollup2
TO SCRIBBLING NOTES NEARBY.

00:56:10.033 --> 00:56:12.736 region:rollup2
INSTEAD IT IS BASED ON THE

00:56:11.001 --> 00:56:14.271 region:rollup2
REALIZATION THAT THERE ARE MANY

00:56:12.736 --> 00:56:15.839 region:rollup2
SOURCES OF TOXIC STRESS IN THE

00:56:14.271 --> 00:56:17.374 region:rollup2
LIVES OF CHILDREN AGED THREE AND

00:56:15.839 --> 00:56:19.476 region:rollup2
UNDER. AND THAT THE STRESSES

00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:22.045 region:rollup2
EXIST EXACT A COST ON THEIR

00:56:19.476 --> 00:56:22.646 region:rollup2
EMOTIONAL WELL BEING AS WELL AS

00:56:22.045 --> 00:56:23.881 region:rollup2
IN THEIR LEARNING AND THINKING

00:56:22.646 --> 00:56:25.449 region:rollup2
SKILLS.

00:56:23.881 --> 00:56:27.417 region:rollup2
TREATING THESE PROBLEMS REQUIRES

00:56:25.449 --> 00:56:29.219 region:rollup2
NOT PSYCHOLOGIST IN CULTURES BUT

00:56:27.417 --> 00:56:30.888 region:rollup2
RATHER SKILLED EARLY CHILDHOOD

00:56:29.219 --> 00:56:32.589 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH PRACTITIONER.

00:56:30.888 --> 00:56:34.424 region:rollup2
WORKING CLOSELY WITH A CHILD AND

00:56:32.589 --> 00:56:36.360 region:rollup2
THEIR CAREGIVERS.

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:37.928 region:rollup2
AND THE REASON FOR THIS

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:39.296 region:rollup2
IS THAT TREATMENT FOR YOUNG

00:56:37.928 --> 00:56:41.265 region:rollup2
CHILDREN IS A TO GENERATIONAL

00:56:39.296 --> 00:56:42.599 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

00:56:41.265 --> 00:56:43.634 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOUNG CHILDREN DEPEND SO

00:56:42.599 --> 00:56:45.202 region:rollup2
MUCH ON THE PROTECTION IN

00:56:43.634 --> 00:56:46.370 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OF THEIR CAREGIVERS THE

00:56:45.202 --> 00:56:47.437 region:rollup2
GOAL OF INTERVENTION IS TO

00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:48.605 region:rollup2
STRENGTHEN THE CHILD'S

00:56:47.437 --> 00:56:50.674 region:rollup2
CAPACITIES FOR LEARNING IN

00:56:48.605 --> 00:56:51.241 region:rollup2
RELATING TO OTHERS.

00:56:50.674 --> 00:56:52.976 region:rollup2
BY IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF

00:56:51.241 --> 00:56:55.112 region:rollup2
CARE.

00:56:52.976 --> 00:56:56.513 region:rollup2
THE CHILD CAN DEPEND ON.

00:56:55.112 --> 00:56:57.447 region:rollup2
IT A POLICY BRIEF COMMISSION BY

00:56:56.513 --> 00:56:58.582 region:rollup2

VARIETY OF EVIDENCE BASED

PROGRAMS WILL BE THAT THAT THAT

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:07.925 region:rollup2
EXISTS TO TRY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS

00:57:05.389 --> 00:57:08.792 region:rollup2

00:59:11.915 --> 00:59:15.118 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD

00:59:13.383 --> 00:59:16.586 region:rollup2
REQUIRE SEVERAL THINGS

00:59:15.118 --> 00:59:18.388 region:rollup2
INCLUDING STRENGTHENING AVENUES

LOCAL COMMUNITIES.

00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:52.355 region:rollup2
IT WOULD ALSO INVOLVE

01:00:00.664 --> 01:00:04.067 region:rollup2
WHAT IS HISTORICALLY NOVEL ABOUT

THE CURRENT MOMENT?

01:00:04.067 --> 01:00:06.369 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT JUST THE WE HAVE MORE

01:00:11.408 --> 01:00:14.845 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT WE CAN TAKE TO

01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:16.646 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES.

01:00:14.845 --> 01:00:18.081 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE MORE EXAMPLES

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:20.617 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY OF STATE

01:00:18.081 --> 01:00:21.918 region:rollup2
BASED BAND LOCAL PROGRAMS THAT

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:23.253 region:rollup2
ARE ALREADY PROVING EFFECTIVE IN

01:00:21.918 --> 01:00:24.721 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING THESE CHALLENGES WE

01:00:23.253 --> 01:00:25.589 region:rollup2
HAVE MORE TOOLS TO WORK WITH.

01:00:24.721 --> 01:00:27.724 region:rollup2
TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM THAT WE

01:00:25.589 --> 01:00:28.492 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND BETTER.

01:00:27.724 --> 01:00:29.893 region:rollup2
SO CREATING THAT SYSTEM IS A

01:00:28.492 --> 01:00:31.795 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING BEFORE CHALLENGE

01:00:29.893 --> 01:00:32.762 region:rollup2
BEFORE US RECOGNIZING THAT BY

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:35.098 region:rollup2
MAKING THESE KINDS OF

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:35.999 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS IN PREVENTIVE AND

01:00:35.098 --> 01:00:37.100 region:rollup2
REMEDIAL SERVICES FOR YOUNG

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:39.135 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WHERE TO BETTER

POSITION TO ENSURE THAT THESE

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:40.704 region:rollup2
CHILDREN GET A HEALTHY START IN

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:41.338 region:rollup2

SOMETHING YEARS AGO OF. ON A

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:23.747 region:rollup2
VERY SIMILAR PATH TO NADINE I

01:01:22.445 --> 01:01:24.814 region:rollup2
READ SOMETHING CALLED THE CENTER

01:01:23.747 --> 01:01:25.982 region:rollup2
FOR THE BOND WILL CHILD AT

01:01:24.814 --> 01:01:28.418 region:rollup2
CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OAKLAND ALL

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:28.952 region:rollup2
WE DID WAS TAKE CARE OF KIDS

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:30.020 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE BEEN ABUSED AND

01:01:28.952 --> 01:01:31.454 region:rollup2
NEGLECTED.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:33.857 region:rollup2
AND SAW LOTS OF THOSE GROWTH

01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:35.191 region:rollup2
TRAJECTORIES WERE KIDS WERE IN

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:37.327 region:rollup2
THE ROTH GOING IN THE WRONG

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:39.596 region:rollup2
DIRECTION. AND WE GOT VERY GOOD

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:41.331 region:rollup2
AT PUTTING TOGETHER SERVICES FOR

01:01:39.596 --> 01:01:42.599 region:rollup2
THEM BUT THAT AT SOME POINT I

01:01:41.331 --> 01:01:43.733 region:rollup2
REALIZED.

01:01:42.599 --> 01:01:45.435 region:rollup2
ARE THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:47.470 region:rollup2
PEDIATRICIANS AND ENOUGH

01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:49.272 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT I HAD TO FIGURE

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:51.207 region:rollup2
OUT HOW TO MOVE UPSTREAM AND

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:52.576 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE STOP THOSE

01:01:51.207 --> 01:01:53.843 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. AND THAT TOO IS

01:01:52.576 --> 01:01:55.679 region:rollup2
TREATED.

01:01:53.843 --> 01:01:56.980 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT I THINK NEEDING TO

01:01:55.679 --> 01:01:58.848 region:rollup2
STAND AS MADE A PALLET FOR

01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:00.250 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT FOR WHY WE NEED TO DO

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:02.218 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TO DO SOMETHING

01:02:00.250 --> 01:02:04.754 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC AND TRANSFORMATIVE. AND

01:02:02.218 --> 01:02:06.690 region:rollup2
ROSS LAID OUT A LOT OF WHAT WE

01:02:04.754 --> 01:02:08.758 region:rollup2
CAN BE DOING AS AS MADE THE AND

01:02:06.690 --> 01:02:10.727 region:rollup2
I'M I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:02:08.758 --> 01:02:13.597 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO THAT. AND

01:02:10.727 --> 01:02:14.164 region:rollup2
WHAT THE POLICY IT SHOULD LOOK

01:02:13.597 --> 01:02:14.431 region:rollup2
LIKE OF WE'RE GOING TO MOVE

01:02:14.164 --> 01:02:16.433 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:02:14.431 --> 01:02:18.268 region:rollup2
WE WERE WE EVER REACH TREATING

01:02:16.433 --> 01:02:20.070 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DREAM I THINK IN THE

01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:21.638 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE HAVE

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.506 region:rollup2
GROWING ADVERSITY BECAUSE OUR

01:02:21.638 --> 01:02:26.076 region:rollup2
HUMAN ACCO SYSTEM IS RADICALLY

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:27.677 region:rollup2
CHANGING RIGHT NOW VERY QUICKLY.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:29.579 region:rollup2
AND IT'S NOT JUST FOR POOR KIDS

01:02:27.677 --> 01:02:31.548 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S FOR ALL CHILDREN WHICH

01:02:29.579 --> 01:02:33.083 region:rollup2
SEEMED DISTRICT AND DEEP CHANGES

01:02:31.548 --> 01:02:34.651 region:rollup2
ARE DISRUPTING FAMILIES AND

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:36.553 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL

01:02:34.651 --> 01:02:38.388 region:rollup2
SCAFFOLDING THE KIDS NEED TO

01:02:36.553 --> 01:02:39.256 region:rollup2
FLOURISH AND THRIVE. IN KIDS ARE

01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:41.658 region:rollup2
KIND OF THE.

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:43.393 region:rollup2
CANARIES IN THE CHANGING GLOBAL

01:02:41.658 --> 01:02:44.894 region:rollup2
COAL MINE THAT'S GOING ON.

01:02:43.393 --> 01:02:46.696 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SYMPTOMATIC PIECEMEAL

01:02:44.894 --> 01:02:48.465 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS THAT ARE COSTLY

01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:50.233 region:rollup2
INEFFECTIVE DISHEARTENING AND

01:02:48.465 --> 01:02:51.301 region:rollup2
OFTEN SELF DEFEATING BECAUSE

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:53.303 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT PUTTING THE PIECES

01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:55.472 region:rollup2
TOGETHER. WE NEED A SYSTEMS

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:57.073 region:rollup2
APPROACH WORKING AT SCALE

01:02:55.472 --> 01:03:00.010 region:rollup2
MEANING THAT WE DID NOT BE DOING

01:02:57.073 --> 01:03:01.878 region:rollup2
DEMOS BUT WORKING AT SCALE IS IN

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:02.379 region:rollup2
A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY WITH

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:04.114 region:rollup2
THE PURPOSE OF A SOCIAL

01:03:02.379 --> 01:03:05.949 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT.

01:03:04.114 --> 01:03:08.285 region:rollup2
AND WHAT YOU HEARD FROM NADINE

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:09.819 region:rollup2
IS A PASS ON THAT SUCH A SOCIAL

01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:10.920 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT THAT WHAT WHAT PURPOSE

01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:12.522 region:rollup2
WOULD BRING.

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:15.091 region:rollup2
A SOLUTION I BELIEVE AS WE NEED

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:17.227 region:rollup2
A UNIVERSAL STRATEGY FOCUSING ON

01:03:15.091 --> 01:03:18.762 region:rollup2
ALL CHILDREN THRIVING AND ALL

01:03:17.227 --> 01:03:20.230 region:rollup2
FAMILIES FLOURISH.

01:03:18.762 --> 01:03:22.532 region:rollup2
WE NEED UNIVERSAL FAMILY

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:24.000 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS BECAUSE THE FAMILIES OF

01:03:22.532 --> 01:03:26.102 region:rollup2
THE ONES THAT ARE STRUGGLING

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.837 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW. AS WELL AS HEALTH

01:03:26.102 --> 01:03:29.305 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION THOSE

01:03:27.837 --> 01:03:32.042 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE UNIVERSAL FOR ALL

01:03:29.305 --> 01:03:34.244 region:rollup2
KIDS WE NEED POPULATION LEVEL

01:03:32.042 --> 01:03:36.313 region:rollup2
DATA AN IMPROVEMENT MANY OTHER

01:03:34.244 --> 01:03:37.981 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES MANY OTHER PLACES HAVE

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:39.549 region:rollup2
THAT DATA WE DON'T. IN

01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:41.518 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WE'VE BEEN RUNNING

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:42.585 region:rollup2
FIRST FIVE MALE FOR ALL CLOSE TO

01:03:41.518 --> 01:03:43.920 region:rollup2
TWENTY YEARS AND WE DON'T EVEN

01:03:42.585 --> 01:03:45.922 region:rollup2
HAVE DATA TO KNOW WHETHER IT'S

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.457 region:rollup2
WORKING AT ALL. SPENT BILLIONS

01:03:45.922 --> 01:03:49.926 region:rollup2
OF DOLLARS WE HAVE NO MEASURES

01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:51.227 region:rollup2
ON THE OUTCOMES FOR THE STATE.

01:03:49.926 --> 01:03:52.495 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BEEN OVER AND WE NEED

01:03:51.227 --> 01:03:54.664 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE FINANCING THAT

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:56.733 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE AS IMMIGRATION

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:58.501 region:rollup2
ACROSS SECTORS IN SILOS AND

01:03:56.733 --> 01:04:00.470 region:rollup2
THERE'S A REAL OPPORTUNITY. TO

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:02.072 region:rollup2
USE THIS CHANGE FROM VOLUME TO

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:03.673 region:rollup2
VALUE FINANCING THEM THE HEALTH

01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:05.241 region:rollup2
CARE SYSTEM WHERE THERE'S FOUR

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:07.010 region:rollup2
BILLION DOLLARS THAT IS A FOUR

01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:08.545 region:rollup2
TRILLION DOLLARS THAT'S GOING TO

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:10.413 region:rollup2
BE SPENT ON TWENTY TWENTY. ON

01:04:08.545 --> 01:04:11.481 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA FOUR

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:13.350 region:rollup2
HUNDRED BILLION IN THE STATE OF

01:04:11.481 --> 01:04:14.584 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA MUCH OF WHICH IS

01:04:13.350 --> 01:04:17.087 region:rollup2
WASTE OF BUT THAT COULD BE

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:19.656 region:rollup2
SHIFTED UPSTREAM TO KIDS.

01:04:17.087 --> 01:04:21.591 region:rollup2
UP IN IN TERMS OF THAT VALUE.

01:04:19.656 --> 01:04:23.093 region:rollup2
AND FOCUS ON CITIES AS UNITS OF

01:04:21.591 --> 01:04:24.594 region:rollup2
INNOVATION IN ACTION AND

01:04:23.093 --> 01:04:26.196 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATION.

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:28.465 region:rollup2
ARE THEY CREATING A LEARNING

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:30.266 region:rollup2
PLATFORM FOR RAPID CYCLE

01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:31.468 region:rollup2
INNOVATION COMMUNICATION MANDATE

01:04:30.266 --> 01:04:33.370 region:rollup2
AT THIS IS MY SORT OF

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:34.704 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTION THAT I THINK FROM A

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:36.973 region:rollup2
POLICY STANDPOINT WE NEED TO BE

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:38.508 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT.

01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:40.310 region:rollup2
IF WE WERE SUCCESSFUL LICENSE

01:04:38.508 --> 01:04:42.645 region:rollup2
WOULD BE DROPPING DOWN PRESIDENT

01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:43.380 region:rollup2
ITALY LOW LEVELS WE'D HAVE LESS

01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:45.448 region:rollup2
NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH JUNE

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:46.783 region:rollup2
WOMAN JUST SO SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:04:45.448 --> 01:04:48.318 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS WOULD BE LESS BURDEN

01:04:46.783 --> 01:04:49.986 region:rollup2
WITH MORE WITH THE KIDS THAT

01:04:48.318 --> 01:04:51.221 region:rollup2
WERE TROUBLE. WE'D HAVE A

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:52.822 region:rollup2
DECREASE PREVALENCE OF THESE

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:54.524 region:rollup2
PREVENTABLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:56.226 region:rollup2
THAT NEED IN I THINK WE COULD

01:04:54.524 --> 01:04:58.461 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DROP OUR HEALTHCARE

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:59.829 region:rollup2
COSTS BY ABOUT A THIRD. IF WE

01:04:58.461 --> 01:05:01.731 region:rollup2
WERE ACTUALLY TO TAKE THIS HAT

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:02.632 region:rollup2
ON A MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE THE

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:04.234 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:05.735 region:rollup2
WE HAVE MORE STABLE HAPPIER

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:07.370 region:rollup2
FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES MORE

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:09.305 region:rollup2
FUNDS TO SPEND ON OTHER STATE

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:10.774 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES AND WE WOULD ACHIEVE

01:05:09.305 --> 01:05:12.275 region:rollup2
THE HUMAN CAPITAL REVOLUTION

01:05:10.774 --> 01:05:14.010 region:rollup2
THAT OUR STATE NEEDS TO FLOURISH

01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:16.112 region:rollup2
IN THE FUTURE. AND I THINK

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:17.580 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE GOAL HERE IS WERE HOW

01:05:16.112 --> 01:05:18.915 region:rollup2
DO WE MOVE TO THIS NEW KIND OF

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:22.685 region:rollup2
FUTURE BY TAKING CARE OF THIS

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:23.953 region:rollup2
REALLY. INSIDIOUS PROBLEM.

01:05:22.685 --> 01:05:25.455 region:rollup2
SO WE KNOW A LOT WOOD THAT'S

01:05:23.953 --> 01:05:26.956 region:rollup2
ALREADY BEEN TALKED ABOUT HOW

01:05:25.455 --> 01:05:29.325 region:rollup2
ADVERSITY TO. REALLY.

01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:30.727 region:rollup2
DAMAGES HUMAN POTENTIAL WE HAVE

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:32.695 region:rollup2
MORE ADVERSITY THAT AN

01:05:30.727 --> 01:05:34.998 region:rollup2
INCREASING AND WHAT I WANT TO

01:05:32.695 --> 01:05:36.800 region:rollup2
MAKE A POINT OF IS THAT IT'S NOT

01:05:34.998 --> 01:05:39.469 region:rollup2
JUST TEMPORE KIDS OR IN LOW

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:41.304 region:rollup2
INCOME KIDS IT'S RISING RIDE UP.

01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:43.173 region:rollup2
THE OF THE.

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:44.107 region:rollup2
INCOME SPECTRUM.

01:05:43.173 --> 01:05:46.176 region:rollup2
IN IT WITH STUDY THAT WE

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:47.610 region:rollup2
RECENTLY SHOWED THAT UP TO FOUR

01:05:46.176 --> 01:05:49.679 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE POVERTY%

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:51.181 region:rollup2
LEVEL YOU HAVE VERY VERY HIGH

01:05:49.679 --> 01:05:53.550 region:rollup2
LEVELS OF BASIS IN THE. IN THE

01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:55.084 region:rollup2
POPULATION AND PART OF THAT HAS

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:57.654 region:rollup2
TO DO WITH THOUGHT WHAT'S GOING

01:05:55.084 --> 01:05:59.355 region:rollup2
ON IN OUR SOCIETY RIGHT NOW.

01:05:57.654 --> 01:06:01.391 region:rollup2
THE TRADITIONAL CAUSES OF BASES

01:05:59.355 --> 01:06:04.327 region:rollup2
ARE POVERTY SOCIAL EXCLUSION

01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:04.861 region:rollup2
RACISM FAMILY DYSFUNCTION ON

01:06:04.327 --> 01:06:05.995 region:rollup2

AN ALCOHOL PROBLEMS ALL THESE

01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:12.235 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE KNOW THAT WOULD

01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:13.970 region:rollup2
SEEM AT FACE VALUE OF THESE

01:06:12.235 --> 01:06:15.438 region:rollup2
THINGS ARE BAD FOR YOU SAID.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:16.739 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARTHY RIGHT

01:06:15.438 --> 01:06:17.674 region:rollup2

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:22.779 region:rollup2
GOOD FOR KIDS AND OTHER LIVING

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:24.414 region:rollup2
THINGS RIGHT WE KNOW THAT.

01:06:22.779 --> 01:06:25.815 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE THESE NEWER DEEPER

01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:28.418 region:rollup2
DRIVERS OF WHAT'S CAUSING

01:06:25.815 --> 01:06:29.752 region:rollup2
ADVERSELY WE'RE MAKING A CHANGE

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:31.054 region:rollup2
OF AGE TO FROM A. FROM AN

01:06:29.752 --> 01:06:33.323 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIAL AGE TO AN INFORMATION

01:06:31.054 --> 01:06:35.258 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY AGE THAT IS CHANGING

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:36.826 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING ON OUR SOCIETY OF

01:06:35.258 --> 01:06:37.794 region:rollup2
PRISA.

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:39.629 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEING MAJOR DE OUT THE.

01:06:37.794 --> 01:06:41.898 region:rollup2
DISRUPTIONS AND ALL OUR BAR

01:06:39.629 --> 01:06:43.266 region:rollup2

01:06:41.898 --> 01:06:45.268 region:rollup2
CHANGES VALUES STREAMS

01:06:43.266 --> 01:06:47.070 region:rollup2
PRODUCTION MODELS WORK MODELS

01:06:45.268 --> 01:06:48.671 region:rollup2
ARE ALL CHANGING RIGHT NOW FOR

01:06:47.070 --> 01:06:49.405 region:rollup2
EVERYONE.

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:51.040 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE SEEING THE

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:53.209 region:rollup2
ACCELERATORS OF THAT CHANGE

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.245 region:rollup2
BEING GLOBALIZATION TECHNOLOGY

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:57.313 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE URBANIZATION

INEQUALITY MASS MIGRATION THIS

01:06:57.313 --> 01:07:01.384 region:rollup2
IS OFF THAT'S A PERFECT STORM OF

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:02.685 region:rollup2
MAJOR TSUNAMIS THAT ARE HITTING

01:07:01.384 --> 01:07:04.120 region:rollup2
OUR SOCIETY AND OUR FUTURE AT

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:05.755 region:rollup2
PRESENT.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:08.057 region:rollup2
AND THIS UNDER COURAGE THAT

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:09.993 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING ON AND THE SPEED OF

01:07:08.057 --> 01:07:12.428 region:rollup2
CHANGE IS ACCELERATING FASTER

01:07:09.993 --> 01:07:13.363 region:rollup2
THAN WE CAN ADAPT TO AT PRESENT.

01:07:12.428 --> 01:07:15.598 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE SEEING THIS

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:18.401 region:rollup2
MISMATCH BETWEEN WHAT WE WERE

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:20.436 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMED OUR ANCESTRAL BIOLOGY

01:07:18.401 --> 01:07:21.638 region:rollup2
AND PSYCHOLOGY IN WHAT WE'RE

01:07:20.436 --> 01:07:23.172 region:rollup2
BEING ASKED TO ADAPT TO. AT

01:07:21.638 --> 01:07:24.374 region:rollup2
PRESENT.

01:07:23.172 --> 01:07:27.010 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING THE

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:28.311 region:rollup2
SUICIDE RATES IN KIDS IN PLACES

01:07:27.010 --> 01:07:29.746 region:rollup2
LIKE PALO ALTO WHERE THEY'RE

01:07:28.311 --> 01:07:31.514 region:rollup2
THROWING THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF

01:07:29.746 --> 01:07:32.749 region:rollup2
TRAINS IT'S NOT POOR KIDS THAT

01:07:31.514 --> 01:07:34.517 region:rollup2
ARE DOING THAT. THESE ARE KIDS

01:07:32.749 --> 01:07:36.052 region:rollup2
THAT ARE IN HIGHER INCOME

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:38.688 region:rollup2
FAMILIES THAT ARE IN MENTAL

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:40.156 region:rollup2
DISTRESS.

01:07:38.688 --> 01:07:41.691 region:rollup2
A PART OF THIS THIS COMES FROM

01:07:40.156 --> 01:07:43.826 region:rollup2
TOM FRIEDMAN'S BOOK WORRY SO

01:07:41.691 --> 01:07:45.828 region:rollup2
SHOWS ARE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES IN

01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:47.897 region:rollup2
HUMAN ADAPTABILITY AND WE HAVE

01:07:45.828 --> 01:07:49.132 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY IN DIGITALIZATION

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:51.034 region:rollup2
STUFF THAT FAR EXCEED WHERE

01:07:49.132 --> 01:07:52.902 region:rollup2
WE'RE AT AT PRESIDENT. AND LOTS

01:07:51.034 --> 01:07:54.370 region:rollup2
OF POOR PEOPLE NOT EDUCATED

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:56.339 region:rollup2
AREN'T UP THERE ON THE

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:58.341 region:rollup2
ADAPTABILITY SIDE OF THIS THING

01:07:56.339 --> 01:08:00.209 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS GONNA JUST GET MORE.

01:07:58.341 --> 01:08:03.046 region:rollup2
AND THE THE REASON I'M MAKING

01:08:00.209 --> 01:08:04.180 region:rollup2
THIS POINT AS THE TSUNAMIS HAVE

01:08:03.046 --> 01:08:07.016 region:rollup2
CHANGE THAT ARE COMING IN AT A.

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:08.151 region:rollup2
AND OCT CHANGING OUR WORKPLACES

01:08:07.016 --> 01:08:09.986 region:rollup2
INCREASING THE WHAT MAN OF ALL

01:08:08.151 --> 01:08:12.155 region:rollup2
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THAT IS

01:08:09.986 --> 01:08:14.190 region:rollup2
GOING TO CHANGE THE THE NATURE

01:08:12.155 --> 01:08:16.726 region:rollup2
OF WORK AND IN CALIFORNIA THE

01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:17.760 region:rollup2
STUFF IS GONNA JUST KEEP COMING.

01:08:16.726 --> 01:08:19.762 region:rollup2
AND IT'S GONNA MAKE PEOPLE THAT

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:21.497 region:rollup2
ARE MARGINALIZED ALREADY AND

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:25.735 region:rollup2
POOR AND ISOLATED EVEN MORE

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:27.270 region:rollup2
MARGINALIZED POOR AND ISOLATED.

01:08:25.735 --> 01:08:29.272 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE THIS GROWING

01:08:27.270 --> 01:08:31.407 region:rollup2
DEBILITATING COMPLEX PROBLEM WE

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:33.476 region:rollup2
HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENTIAL

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:35.845 region:rollup2
LIFELONG A FAX THERE'S NO SINGLE

01:08:33.476 --> 01:08:37.680 region:rollup2
CAUSE AND NO MAGIC BULLET. WE

01:08:35.845 --> 01:08:39.983 region:rollup2
KNOW IT'S AFFECTING LOTSA KIDS

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:42.085 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WERE SEEN RIGHT NOW WE

01:08:39.983 --> 01:08:42.585 region:rollup2
HAVE FORTY PERCENT OF CHILDREN

01:08:42.085 --> 01:08:43.786 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE CHRONIC HEALTH

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:45.288 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS.

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:47.824 region:rollup2
OKAY WHEN I STARTED AS A

01:08:45.288 --> 01:08:49.859 region:rollup2
PEDIATRICIAN TWENTY BOATS TWENTY

01:08:47.824 --> 01:08:51.694 region:rollup2
FOUR CLOSE TO THIRTY FIVE YEARS

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:52.095 region:rollup2
AGO THAT WAS AROUND FIFTEEN

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:54.097 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

01:08:52.095 --> 01:08:55.431 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:08:54.097 --> 01:08:56.899 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A GROWING PREVALENCE OF

01:08:55.431 --> 01:08:58.901 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS TWENTY

01:08:56.899 --> 01:09:01.137 region:rollup2
POINT EIGHT PERCENT OF KIDS

01:08:58.901 --> 01:09:02.305 region:rollup2
ADOLESCENTS HAVE MENTAL HEALTH

01:09:01.137 --> 01:09:04.340 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS WITH IMPAIRMENTS OF

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:05.274 region:rollup2
PRESS.

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:06.342 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE A GREATER

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:07.844 region:rollup2
APPRECIATION OF THESE NARROW

01:09:06.342 --> 01:09:09.979 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEMS AND LOTS

01:09:07.844 --> 01:09:11.814 region:rollup2
OF KIDS WITH MULTIPLE PROBLEMS

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:13.216 region:rollup2
THESE ARE CALLED SIN DEL MIX.

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:14.917 region:rollup2
THESE ARE WHEN IT EPIDEMIC

01:09:13.216 --> 01:09:17.020 region:rollup2
SOURCE ENERGIZING TOGETHER AND

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:18.554 region:rollup2
THEY'RE REFINING THE ROOTS BACK

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:20.757 region:rollup2
TO THE SUPER EARLY ADVERSITY

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:22.792 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE ALL FINDING THEIR

01:09:20.757 --> 01:09:23.993 region:rollup2
WAY BACK TO.

01:09:22.792 --> 01:09:26.029 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE SEEING THE PRUSSIAN

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:28.231 region:rollup2
RATES THAT ARE JUST SKYROCKETING

01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:30.166 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS.

01:09:28.231 --> 01:09:31.834 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THIS

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:33.503 region:rollup2
THING'S JUST CASCADE THEM NADINE

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:35.705 region:rollup2
WAS SHOWING THIS HOW THAT'S JUST

01:09:33.503 --> 01:09:38.241 region:rollup2
CASCADES THROUGH THE LIFESPAN.

01:09:35.705 --> 01:09:41.611 region:rollup2
AND ENDS UP HAVING AN ENORMOUS

01:09:38.241 --> 01:09:43.446 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF FOR OUR SOCIETY.

01:09:41.611 --> 01:09:45.448 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THE SCIENCE AND THE

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:47.383 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE IN THE PROGRAMS AS ROSS

01:09:45.448 --> 01:09:48.851 region:rollup2
WAS TALKING ABOUT NAY DEAN WAS

01:09:47.383 --> 01:09:51.387 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT BAR CURRENT

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:53.823 region:rollup2
APPROACHES PIECEMEAL FRAGMENTED.

01:09:51.387 --> 01:09:55.258 region:rollup2
WE HAVE NO COMMON METRICS GOALS

01:09:53.823 --> 01:09:57.527 region:rollup2
AND STANDARDS AND PART OF THE

01:09:55.258 --> 01:10:00.329 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS HERE. WE'VE MADE LOTS

01:09:57.527 --> 01:10:02.265 region:rollup2
OF POLICIES THAT ACTUALLY.

01:10:00.329 --> 01:10:03.933 region:rollup2
THINGS SEPARATE AND FUN THING

01:10:02.265 --> 01:10:06.969 region:rollup2
SEPARATELY BUT DON'T ALLOW US TO

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:08.571 region:rollup2
PUT RATIONAL SYSTEMS TOGETHER.

01:10:06.969 --> 01:10:10.239 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED A LONG TERM IN THE

01:10:08.571 --> 01:10:12.341 region:rollup2
GREAT A POLICY IN LEARNING

01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:14.277 region:rollup2
STRATEGY THIS HAS TO BE THIS IS

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:15.778 region:rollup2
LIKE FOR FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:10:14.277 --> 01:10:16.879 region:rollup2
THIS IS LIKE PUTTING A WHOLE NEW

01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:18.514 region:rollup2
WATER SYSTEM A WHOLE NEW

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:19.949 region:rollup2
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IN THE

01:10:18.514 --> 01:10:22.652 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE NEED A

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:24.220 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN YEAR PLAN FOR HUMAN

01:10:22.652 --> 01:10:26.589 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM FOR THE CAT

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:27.590 region:rollup2
STATE A CALIFORNIA THAT'S GOING

01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:29.125 region:rollup2
TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:30.626 region:rollup2
IF WE KEEP THROWING MORE MODEL

01:10:29.125 --> 01:10:31.961 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS A LITTLE BIT HERE AND

01:10:30.626 --> 01:10:33.730 region:rollup2
THERE WERE GOING TO END UP WITH

01:10:31.961 --> 01:10:34.564 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT OF KIDS GET THIS IN

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:36.766 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT WHO NEED TO GET

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:39.102 region:rollup2
THAT. AND WE'VE STILL WON'T BE

01:10:36.766 --> 01:10:40.570 region:rollup2
MAKING THE KIND OF PROGRESS.

01:10:39.102 --> 01:10:42.572 region:rollup2
THE WAY THAT WE'VE TRIED TO MAKE

01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:44.173 region:rollup2
THIS VERY SIMPLE TO COMMUNITIES

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:45.908 region:rollup2
ONE WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM AS

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:47.543 region:rollup2
WE SHOW THESE DEVELOPMENTAL

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:49.912 region:rollup2
TRAJECTORIES KITS CAN GO INTO A

01:10:47.543 --> 01:10:51.748 region:rollup2
DILLON LATER DISORDER TRAJECTORY

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:53.649 region:rollup2
OR AT RISK TRAJECTORY. ME UP

01:10:51.748 --> 01:10:55.284 region:rollup2
PROBABLY TEN FIFTEEN PERCENT

01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:57.120 region:rollup2
BELOW US PROBABLY ANOTHER THIRTY

01:10:55.284 --> 01:10:59.255 region:rollup2
TO FORTY PERCENT. AND THE MORE

01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:00.156 region:rollup2
ADVERSITY YOU HAVE THEM WHAT

01:10:59.255 --> 01:11:02.458 region:rollup2
LORD YOU GO ON THE LOWER

01:11:00.156 --> 01:11:04.460 region:rollup2
TRAJECTORIES MORE PROTECTIVE

01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:06.095 region:rollup2
FACTORS YOU HAVE TO GO ON A

01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:07.196 region:rollup2
HIGHER TRAJECTORY.

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:08.331 region:rollup2
KIDS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER INCOME

01:11:07.196 --> 01:11:10.166 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES HAVE MORE THESE

01:11:08.331 --> 01:11:11.834 region:rollup2
PROTECTIVE FACTORS IN FEWER

01:11:10.166 --> 01:11:13.569 region:rollup2
THESE RISK FACTORS SO THE NAME

01:11:11.834 --> 01:11:15.104 region:rollup2
OF THE GAME FROM A PUBLIC POLICY

01:11:13.569 --> 01:11:16.739 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT IS HOW DO WE INCREASE

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:18.274 region:rollup2
THE PROTECTIVE FACTORS. AND

01:11:16.739 --> 01:11:20.343 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE RISK FACTOR SO WE

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:22.378 region:rollup2
HAVE MORE RESILIENCE IN THE

01:11:20.343 --> 01:11:24.080 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND IN THE FAMILY.

01:11:22.378 --> 01:11:25.548 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S ABOUT HAROLD OLD RULE

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:27.483 region:rollup2
SALIENT SOCIAL CONNECTIONS

01:11:25.548 --> 01:11:29.018 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE SKILLS AND THEIR

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:30.787 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS.

01:11:29.018 --> 01:11:32.655 region:rollup2
AND THERE ARE A WHOLE SET OF

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:34.557 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL STRATEGIES THAT WE'VE

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:36.459 region:rollup2
HEARD ABOUT THAT WE CAN DO THAT

01:11:34.557 --> 01:11:38.094 region:rollup2
WE CAN IDENTIFY AND INTERVENE

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:39.529 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A GREAT THERAPIES

01:11:38.094 --> 01:11:41.297 region:rollup2
INFANT MENTAL HEALTH AND OTHER

01:11:39.529 --> 01:11:42.365 region:rollup2
CLIENT. THE MINDFULNESS

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:44.200 region:rollup2
THERAPIES I THINK OR SOMETHING

01:11:42.365 --> 01:11:47.570 region:rollup2
THAT ARE REALLY HAVE LOTS OF

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.570 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS BUT WE NEED TO THINK

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:50.506 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:52.175 region:rollup2
THREE PERCENT OR FIVE PERCENT

01:11:50.506 --> 01:11:53.743 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWENTY

01:11:52.175 --> 01:11:54.777 region:rollup2
THIRTY FORTY PERCENT OF THE

01:11:53.743 --> 01:11:56.612 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

01:11:54.777 --> 01:11:57.747 region:rollup2
AT PRESENT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

01:11:56.612 --> 01:11:59.549 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE START SHIFTING THE

01:11:57.747 --> 01:12:01.517 region:rollup2
CURVE FOR ALL THE CHILDREN HOW

01:11:59.549 --> 01:12:02.585 region:rollup2
DO WE BUILD. COMMUNITIES MORE

01:12:01.517 --> 01:12:04.420 region:rollup2
RESULTS ARE GONNA SHOW YOU THIS

01:12:02.585 --> 01:12:07.824 region:rollup2
IT'S A LITTLE WONKY BUT WHAT

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:08.858 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SEEING HERE AS ANY KIND

01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:10.326 region:rollup2
OF DEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOME.

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:11.828 region:rollup2
AND WHAT YOU SEE ON THE LEFT A

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:13.129 region:rollup2
POOR KIDS THERE ARE IN THE RED

01:12:11.828 --> 01:12:14.764 region:rollup2
THEIR SORT OF.

01:12:13.129 --> 01:12:16.265 region:rollup2
SHIFT TO THE LEFT IN THE RICH

01:12:14.764 --> 01:12:17.800 region:rollup2
ONES YOURSELF TO THE RIGHT NEAR

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:19.035 region:rollup2
YOUR TRAUMATIZED AND VULNERABLE

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:20.937 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

01:12:19.035 --> 01:12:22.505 region:rollup2
AND ONE PART ONE WAY WE DO IS WE

01:12:20.937 --> 01:12:23.706 region:rollup2
GOING ON SCREEN FOR THESE KIDS

01:12:22.505 --> 01:12:25.374 region:rollup2
AND THEN TRY TO MOVE THEM

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:26.776 region:rollup2
THROUGH INDIVIDUAL THERAPY MOVE

01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:28.611 region:rollup2
THEM OVER.

01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:30.780 region:rollup2
ANOTHER WAY IS TO TARGET A WHOLE

01:12:28.611 --> 01:12:31.847 region:rollup2
POPULATION THROUGH TARGETED

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:33.449 region:rollup2
APPROACHES TOWARDS WHOLE

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:34.350 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

01:12:33.449 --> 01:12:36.052 region:rollup2
IF THE PREVALENCE OF GREY THERE

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:37.653 region:rollup2
IN TEN FIFTEEN TWENTY PERCENT

01:12:36.052 --> 01:12:39.155 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SCREEN ANYMORE

01:12:37.653 --> 01:12:41.157 region:rollup2
YOU NEED TO PUT SOMETHING MORE

01:12:39.155 --> 01:12:42.825 region:rollup2
UNIVERSAL IMPLIES.

01:12:41.157 --> 01:12:44.894 region:rollup2
AND ONE IDEA BEEN GETS GREATER

01:12:42.825 --> 01:12:46.629 region:rollup2
THE REAL PUT WAY TO MOVE IS TO

01:12:44.894 --> 01:12:48.564 region:rollup2
USE UNIVERSAL SCURRIED SHIFTING

01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:50.299 region:rollup2
YOU SHIFT THE ENTIRE CREW. IT'S

01:12:48.564 --> 01:12:52.368 region:rollup2
A VERY DIFFERENT STRATEGY TO

01:12:50.299 --> 01:12:53.803 region:rollup2
WORK AT THE MARGIN TO WORK AT

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:55.738 region:rollup2
BRINGING IN THE TAIL OF THE

01:12:53.803 --> 01:12:56.572 region:rollup2
CURVE VERSUS TRYING TO SHIFT THE

01:12:55.738 --> 01:12:57.673 region:rollup2
WHOLE CURVE.

01:12:56.572 --> 01:12:59.075 region:rollup2
AND RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE

01:12:57.673 --> 01:13:01.110 region:rollup2
LEVERAGE AT THE TAIL OF THE

01:12:59.075 --> 01:13:02.979 region:rollup2
CURVE WE CAN'T GET AHEAD OF THIS

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:04.413 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING ON BY JUST MOVING

01:13:02.979 --> 01:13:06.282 region:rollup2
AT THE TAIL WE HAVE TO HAVE

01:13:04.413 --> 01:13:08.184 region:rollup2
MEDIAN RENTS STRATEGIES TO MOVE

01:13:06.282 --> 01:13:10.019 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:13:08.184 --> 01:13:11.687 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT

01:13:10.019 --> 01:13:13.422 region:rollup2
THESE TRAJECTORIES WERE TRYING

01:13:11.687 --> 01:13:15.958 region:rollup2
TO ACHIEVE AND THAT ALL CHILDREN

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:17.693 region:rollup2
NEED FAMILY FOUNDATIONAL KINDS

01:13:15.958 --> 01:13:19.028 region:rollup2
OF SUPPORT READING MINDFULNESS

01:13:17.693 --> 01:13:19.595 region:rollup2
TRAINING HEALTH SERVICES

01:13:19.028 --> 01:13:22.531 region:rollup2
PRESCHOOL ALL KIDS NEED THAT

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:23.766 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:25.234 region:rollup2
KIDS THAT HAVE A HIGHER RISK

01:13:23.766 --> 01:13:26.769 region:rollup2
NEED OTHER KINDS OF SERVICES AND

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:28.638 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE THOSE KIDS

01:13:26.769 --> 01:13:30.506 region:rollup2
ARE AND GET THEM TO WOMAN THEY

01:13:28.638 --> 01:13:31.841 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE SCREENFORM

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:34.110 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD JUST KNOW HOW TO DO

01:13:31.841 --> 01:13:36.212 region:rollup2
THAT. OTHER COUNTRIES DO THIS

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:38.247 region:rollup2
WITH GREAT EASE THE COMPARATIVE

01:13:36.212 --> 01:13:39.282 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:40.082 region:rollup2
AND FOR THOSE THAT ARE HIGHER

01:13:39.282 --> 01:13:41.884 region:rollup2
RISK YOU'RE GONNA NEED

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:43.085 region:rollup2
SPECIALIZED SERVICES SO WE NEED

01:13:41.884 --> 01:13:45.221 region:rollup2
TO FIGURE OUT WHO GETS WHAT AND

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:46.222 region:rollup2
HOW.

01:13:45.221 --> 01:13:48.224 region:rollup2
AND I'M JUST GONNA TALK ABOUT

01:13:46.222 --> 01:13:50.092 region:rollup2
ONE PROGRAM THAT'S ONE OF MY

01:13:48.224 --> 01:13:51.894 region:rollup2
FAVORITE PROGRAMS BECAUSE I

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:53.162 region:rollup2
REALLY THINK THAT THIS HAS TO DO

01:13:51.894 --> 01:13:55.598 region:rollup2
WITH FAMILIES AND REALLY

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:57.433 region:rollup2
SUPPORTING ALL FAMILIES.

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:59.568 region:rollup2
AND BY THINKING ABOUT FAMILIES

01:13:57.433 --> 01:14:00.970 region:rollup2
THAT ADVERSITY IN FAMILIES IS

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:02.772 region:rollup2
MEASURABLE AND CON MEN ACROSS

01:14:00.970 --> 01:14:05.341 region:rollup2
THE INCOME SPECTRUM FAMILY

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:07.476 region:rollup2
CONFLICT THIS CONFLICT THAT. IS

01:14:05.341 --> 01:14:09.312 region:rollup2
MEASURABLE IMPACTS ON CHILDREN

01:14:07.476 --> 01:14:10.713 region:rollup2
AND PART OF THIS IS THAT WE LIVE

01:14:09.312 --> 01:14:12.281 region:rollup2
IN A SOCIETY TODAY WHERE WE'RE

01:14:10.713 --> 01:14:14.283 region:rollup2
NOT MARRIED MARRYING SOMEBODY

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:15.618 region:rollup2
FROM OUR OWN TRIBE ANYMORE WHERE

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:17.753 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE TO NEGOTIATE

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:18.554 region:rollup2
THINGS WE ALL MARY STRANGERS

01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:20.256 region:rollup2
REALLY.

01:14:18.554 --> 01:14:21.691 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE HAVE TO NEGOTIATE

01:14:20.256 --> 01:14:23.159 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING THAT WE DO ONE PARENT

01:14:21.691 --> 01:14:24.460 region:rollup2
TEEN RE PARENTING BURKE SOME

01:14:23.159 --> 01:14:26.329 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT THERE'S LOTS OF

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:29.332 region:rollup2
CONFLICT IN FAMILIES.

01:14:26.329 --> 01:14:30.866 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE FAMILY INCOME

01:14:29.332 --> 01:14:33.970 region:rollup2
INSECURITY THAT BRIAN'S IS RIGHT

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:35.171 region:rollup2
UP TO HALF THE POPULATION IN

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:36.605 region:rollup2
THAT CREATES MORE CONFLICT.

01:14:35.171 --> 01:14:38.207 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT BY

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:40.109 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE PARENT TEAM WE CAN

01:14:38.207 --> 01:14:42.044 region:rollup2
ENJOY UNDER RESILIENCE AND

01:14:40.109 --> 01:14:43.746 region:rollup2
FAMILIES AND IT REALLY. HELP

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:44.814 region:rollup2
THEM MOVE FORWARD.

01:14:43.746 --> 01:14:46.482 region:rollup2
AND THIS A SOMETHING WHEN YOU

01:14:44.814 --> 01:14:48.617 region:rollup2
HAVE TWO PARENTS WORKING IN THE

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:51.220 region:rollup2
STRESS OF TIME AND MONEY THAT

01:14:48.617 --> 01:14:52.488 region:rollup2
FAN ALL FAMILIES NEED RIGHT NOW.

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:54.690 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A THING CALLED

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:56.559 region:rollup2
FAMILY FOUNDATIONS A PROGRAM

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:57.727 region:rollup2
THAT WAS DEVELOPED AT PENN STATE

01:14:56.559 --> 01:14:59.328 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY I HAVE NO STOCK AND

01:14:57.727 --> 01:15:01.831 region:rollup2
IT IT'S JUST. THE ONE THAT'S

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:03.532 region:rollup2
BEEN ADVOCATED BY THE NATIONAL

01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:04.834 region:rollup2
ACADEMY OF MEDICINE IN THEIR

01:15:03.532 --> 01:15:07.236 region:rollup2
REVIEW OF THINGS.

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:09.038 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY CHEAP AND CHEERFUL

01:15:07.236 --> 01:15:11.440 region:rollup2
IT'S DONE LIKE BIRTH CLASSES BUT

01:15:09.038 --> 01:15:13.109 region:rollup2
FOUR CLASSES BEFORE BABY IS BORN

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.377 region:rollup2
FOR AFTER A BABY IS BORN AND

01:15:13.109 --> 01:15:16.479 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT CORPS PARENTING IT'S

01:15:14.377 --> 01:15:18.314 region:rollup2
NOT ABOUT TEACHING MOTHERS TO BE

01:15:16.479 --> 01:15:19.882 region:rollup2
BETTER MOTHERS ABOUT. THE DYADIC

01:15:18.314 --> 01:15:21.784 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP WHICH HAS BEEN A

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:23.119 region:rollup2
LOT OF WHAT INCREMENTAL HEALTH

01:15:21.784 --> 01:15:24.553 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN ABOUT ABOUT. TEACHING

01:15:23.119 --> 01:15:25.321 region:rollup2
PARENTS HOW TO CO PARENT

01:15:24.553 --> 01:15:27.256 region:rollup2
TOGETHER.

01:15:25.321 --> 01:15:28.524 region:rollup2
AND HOW TO WORK TOGETHER AND I

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:30.559 region:rollup2
CAN ALSO WORK WHEN YOU DON'T

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:32.228 region:rollup2
HAVE A CO PARENT YOU CAN DO WITH

01:15:30.559 --> 01:15:33.963 region:rollup2
YOUR GRANDMOTHER OR YOUR AND IF

01:15:32.228 --> 01:15:34.997 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S THE SITUATION.

01:15:33.963 --> 01:15:36.899 region:rollup2
AND THESE ARE THE EFFECTS THAT

01:15:34.997 --> 01:15:38.334 region:rollup2
IT HAS.

01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:40.069 region:rollup2
IT DECREASES PRETERM BIRTH AND

01:15:38.334 --> 01:15:42.338 region:rollup2
LOW BIRTH WEIGHT.

01:15:40.069 --> 01:15:44.373 region:rollup2
CRISIS HOSPITAL STAYS PARENTAL

01:15:42.338 --> 01:15:46.208 region:rollup2
STRESS PARENTAL DEPRESSION.

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:47.777 region:rollup2
IT CHANGES THE WAY THE PARENTS

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:49.545 region:rollup2
PARENT.

01:15:47.777 --> 01:15:50.046 region:rollup2
IT CREATES CONFLICTS IMPROVES

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:52.214 region:rollup2
CHILD MENTAL HEALTH AND

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:53.949 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR.

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:56.118 region:rollup2
CREATES COOPERATION AND AGE

01:15:53.949 --> 01:15:57.586 region:rollup2
EIGHT THESE KIDS WORK MUCH

01:15:56.118 --> 01:15:59.255 region:rollup2
BETTER IN SCHOOL ON THIS A SOME.

01:15:57.586 --> 01:16:00.956 region:rollup2
I OF SOME APPROACH AGAIN THE

01:15:59.255 --> 01:16:02.658 region:rollup2
COULD BE UNIVERSAL.

01:16:00.956 --> 01:16:04.860 region:rollup2
SO THE OTHER THING THAT WE NEED

01:16:02.658 --> 01:16:07.129 region:rollup2
BE SIDE UNIVERSAL THINGS AS WE

01:16:04.860 --> 01:16:09.131 region:rollup2
NEED BETTER DATA AN IMPROVEMENT

01:16:07.129 --> 01:16:11.167 region:rollup2
AND WE NEED TO HELP POPULATION

01:16:09.131 --> 01:16:12.835 region:rollup2
LEVEL COMMUNITY DATA. THAT WE

01:16:11.167 --> 01:16:13.702 region:rollup2
CAN MEASURE THESE TRAJECTORIES

01:16:12.835 --> 01:16:15.404 region:rollup2
TO FOR INTERESTED IN

01:16:13.702 --> 01:16:16.772 region:rollup2
TRAJECTORIES WE HAVE TO BE ABLE

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:18.374 region:rollup2
TO MEASURE OF THEM. THEY'RE

01:16:16.772 --> 01:16:19.842 region:rollup2
MEASURING THEM IN CANADA OTHER

01:16:18.374 --> 01:16:21.577 region:rollup2
MEASURING THEM IN AUSTRALIA

01:16:19.842 --> 01:16:22.978 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE COUNTRY WE'RE JUST

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:24.847 region:rollup2
NOT DOING THAT.

01:16:22.978 --> 01:16:26.515 region:rollup2
HERE'S THE CITY OF PASADENA

01:16:24.847 --> 01:16:28.250 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY'VE MEASURE OF ALL OF

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:29.585 region:rollup2
THE CHILDREN AT AGE FIVE USING

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:31.120 region:rollup2
SOMETHING CALLED THE EARLY

01:16:29.585 --> 01:16:32.021 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT AND THAT.

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:33.689 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE MEASURING THEIR

01:16:32.021 --> 01:16:36.192 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL COGNITIVE

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:37.560 region:rollup2
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND MAPPING

01:16:36.192 --> 01:16:38.861 region:rollup2
AT A NEIGHBORHOOD BY

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:40.996 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL MEN LOOKING

01:16:38.861 --> 01:16:42.164 region:rollup2
AT WHO'S GETTING CHILD CARE AND

01:16:40.996 --> 01:16:43.999 region:rollup2
WHO ISN'T GETTING CHILDCARE.

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:46.035 region:rollup2
SO THEY'RE MAKING POPULATION Y.

01:16:43.999 --> 01:16:47.803 region:rollup2
DECISIONS FOR THE ENTIRE CITY OF

01:16:46.035 --> 01:16:50.039 region:rollup2
PASADENA.

01:16:47.803 --> 01:16:51.740 region:rollup2
AND CHANGING WHAT THEY'RE DOING

01:16:50.039 --> 01:16:54.243 region:rollup2
THEY CREATED AN EARLY CHILDHOOD

01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:56.178 region:rollup2
POLICY FOR THE CITY OF PASADENA

01:16:54.243 --> 01:16:57.546 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A BLUEPRINT NOW OF HOW

01:16:56.178 --> 01:16:59.281 region:rollup2
TO MOVE FORWARD THEY CREATED AN

01:16:57.546 --> 01:17:01.517 region:rollup2
OFFICE OF THE YOUNG CHILD IN

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:03.552 region:rollup2
PASADENA. SIMILAR THINGS GOING

01:17:01.517 --> 01:17:05.221 region:rollup2
ON A LONG BEACH SIMILAR THINGS

01:17:03.552 --> 01:17:06.755 region:rollup2
GOING ON IN SANTA MONICA SIMILAR

01:17:05.221 --> 01:17:08.157 region:rollup2
THINGS HAPPEN IN OTHER CITIES

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:10.526 region:rollup2
AROUND THE COUNTRY THIS IS A

01:17:08.157 --> 01:17:12.728 region:rollup2
CITY STRATEGY USING DATA. FOR

01:17:10.526 --> 01:17:14.597 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE CITY TO MOVE FORWARD.

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:15.498 region:rollup2
AND HAVE A MASTER PLAN FOR

01:17:14.597 --> 01:17:17.266 region:rollup2
PASADENA.

01:17:15.498 --> 01:17:18.334 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE MAGNOLIA COMMUNITY

01:17:17.266 --> 01:17:20.169 region:rollup2
IN THIS SHOULD OF THE LOS

01:17:18.334 --> 01:17:21.637 region:rollup2
ANGELES WHICH IS ABOUT FIVE

HUNDRED SQUARE BLOCKS IN THIRTY

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:25.641 region:rollup2
FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN THIS

01:17:23.772 --> 01:17:27.409 region:rollup2
ISN'T ABOUT BUILDING A LITTLE.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:28.544 region:rollup2
PROGRAM FOR TWO HUNDRED OR THREE

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:30.412 region:rollup2
HUNDRED KIDS THIS IS ABOUT

01:17:28.544 --> 01:17:32.148 region:rollup2
TAKING ALL ALL THE CHILDREN

01:17:30.412 --> 01:17:33.916 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOOD. AGAIN THERE

01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:35.718 region:rollup2
MAPPING ALL OF THE CHILDREN

01:17:33.916 --> 01:17:37.453 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY LIVE THERE LOOKING AT

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:38.254 region:rollup2
HOW WELL THEY SPEAK AND WHAT

01:17:37.453 --> 01:17:39.622 region:rollup2
THEIR LANGUAGE FUNCTION IS AND

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:41.457 region:rollup2
WHETHER THEIR PARENTS ARE

01:17:39.622 --> 01:17:42.591 region:rollup2
READING TO THEM.

01:17:41.457 --> 01:17:43.959 region:rollup2
AND THEN THERE SURVEYING THE

01:17:42.591 --> 01:17:45.494 region:rollup2
PAPER THE PARENTS IN THE

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:47.763 region:rollup2

HAVE RESILIENCE AND SUPPORTS AND

01:17:47.763 --> 01:17:51.901 region:rollup2
VARIOUS THINGS. SO THESE ARE

01:17:49.198 --> 01:17:53.869 region:rollup2
POPULATION STRATEGIES ABOUT

01:17:51.901 --> 01:17:55.504 region:rollup2
SHIFTING THE ENTIRE CREW. THIS

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:57.606 region:rollup2
ISN'T ABOUT THROWING MORE MONEY

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:59.542 region:rollup2
INTO TREATMENT IT'S ABOUT

01:17:57.606 --> 01:18:01.844 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT THIS IS A PUBLIC

01:17:59.542 --> 01:18:04.346 region:rollup2
HEALTH INTERVENTIONS.

01:18:01.844 --> 01:18:05.814 region:rollup2
LASTLY THINKING ABOUT FINANCES

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:07.583 region:rollup2
WE NEED THE BAY HAVING SILO

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:10.052 region:rollup2
BUSTING SOLUTIONS IN VARIOUS

01:18:07.583 --> 01:18:11.754 region:rollup2
STATE INVESTING IN HUMAN CAPITAL

01:18:10.052 --> 01:18:12.988 region:rollup2
LEVERAGING LOTS OF WASTE OF

01:18:11.754 --> 01:18:14.223 region:rollup2
MONEY IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

01:18:12.988 --> 01:18:15.891 region:rollup2
OF PROCESS.

01:18:14.223 --> 01:18:17.026 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO SHIFT MONEY IN

01:18:15.891 --> 01:18:19.061 region:rollup2
THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FROM

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:22.031 region:rollup2
VOLUME TO VALUE OVER THE NEXT.

01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:23.399 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS.

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:27.736 region:rollup2
AND I PLOY BY IPHONE OUT FOR A

01:18:23.399 --> 01:18:29.271 region:rollup2
REASON.

01:18:27.736 --> 01:18:34.944 region:rollup2
TAKE YOUR IPHONE I'M SURE A LOT

01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:36.412 region:rollup2
OF YOU HAVE IPHONES.

01:18:34.944 --> 01:18:38.347 region:rollup2
AND YOU CLICK ON IT EVERYTHING

01:18:36.412 --> 01:18:40.249 region:rollup2
STARTS TO JUGGLE. THAT'S WHAT WE

01:18:38.347 --> 01:18:41.417 region:rollup2
ARE ARE IN THE HEALTH CARE

01:18:40.249 --> 01:18:43.586 region:rollup2
SYSTEM RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN JUNGLE

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:45.521 region:rollup2
MODE. BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING ON

01:18:43.586 --> 01:18:47.323 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IS THE INVISIBLE HAND

01:18:45.521 --> 01:18:49.291 region:rollup2
OF VALUES GOING TO START MOVING

01:18:47.323 --> 01:18:50.693 region:rollup2
THE THINGS IN THE HEALTH CARE

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:52.761 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AROUND SO THAT WE GET. A

01:18:50.693 --> 01:18:55.164 region:rollup2
HIGHER PERFORMING HEALTH SYSTEM

01:18:52.761 --> 01:18:56.932 region:rollup2
IF IT'S LEFT UP TO ORTHOPEDIC

01:18:55.164 --> 01:18:58.968 region:rollup2
SURGEONS IT'LL BE ABOUT BUNDLING

01:18:56.932 --> 01:19:00.436 region:rollup2
PAYMENTS FOR SHOULDERS HER HIPS

01:18:58.968 --> 01:19:02.037 region:rollup2
ARE NEEDS.

01:19:00.436 --> 01:19:04.673 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND THINKING ABOUT HOW

01:19:02.037 --> 01:19:06.175 region:rollup2
WE INCREASE VALUE IN THAT WAY.

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:07.676 region:rollup2
WE COULD ALSO BE THINKING ABOUT

01:19:06.175 --> 01:19:09.244 region:rollup2
HOW WE INCREASE VALUE BY

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:11.180 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT HOW WE INCREASE

01:19:09.244 --> 01:19:12.548 region:rollup2
VALUE BY INVESTING MORE CHILDREN

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:14.350 region:rollup2
EARLY ON.

01:19:12.548 --> 01:19:16.986 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE WAYS TO THINK

01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:19.755 region:rollup2
ABOUT DOING THAT. IS BY THINKING

01:19:16.986 --> 01:19:23.459 region:rollup2
ABOUT BUNDLING PAYMENT SO THAT

01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:25.127 region:rollup2
WE TOOK PAYMENTS AND EXTENT OF.

01:19:23.459 --> 01:19:26.462 region:rollup2
HAVING A BOTTLE FOR A NEW YOUR

01:19:25.127 --> 01:19:27.062 region:rollup2
SHOULDER OPERATION WHAT IF WE

01:19:26.462 --> 01:19:27.730 region:rollup2
HAD A BUNDLE FOR MINUS NINE

01:19:27.062 --> 01:19:30.199 region:rollup2
MONTHS OF AGE TO FIVE YEARS OF

01:19:27.730 --> 01:19:33.869 region:rollup2
AGE. WE PUT ALL OF THE PRIMARY

01:19:30.199 --> 01:19:34.970 region:rollup2
HEALTH SERVICES INTO THAT BUNDLE

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:36.839 region:rollup2
WE PUT PRESCHOOL INTO THAT

01:19:34.970 --> 01:19:37.706 region:rollup2
BUNDLE EARLY INTERVENTION AND WE

01:19:36.839 --> 01:19:38.274 region:rollup2
GAVE IT TO COMMUNITIES AND SAY.

01:19:37.706 --> 01:19:39.675 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE THIS MONEY IT'S

01:19:38.274 --> 01:19:41.543 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED NOW YOU COMPOSED

01:19:39.675 --> 01:19:42.978 region:rollup2
TOGETHER YOU CAN ACTUALLY PUT

01:19:41.543 --> 01:19:44.813 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED SERVICES AND MENTAL

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:46.181 region:rollup2
HEALTH SERVICES WITH PRIMARY

01:19:44.813 --> 01:19:47.916 region:rollup2
CARE THE KIND OF THING THAT

01:19:46.181 --> 01:19:49.685 region:rollup2
NADINE IS A DOING THAT SHE'S

01:19:47.916 --> 01:19:51.387 region:rollup2
FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO. HOW DO

01:19:49.685 --> 01:19:52.788 region:rollup2
WE MAKE THAT UNIVERSAL TITLE WE

01:19:51.387 --> 01:19:54.823 region:rollup2
MAKE ALL THESE MENTAL HEALTH

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:56.325 region:rollup2
SERVICES AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:58.160 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO HAVE A FUNDING

01:19:56.325 --> 01:20:00.229 region:rollup2
STRATEGY TO DO THAT? CITY

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:02.097 region:rollup2
WASHINGTON DC IS CONTEMPLATING

01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:04.099 region:rollup2
THIS RIGHT NOW WORKING WITH THE

01:20:02.097 --> 01:20:06.235 region:rollup2
URBAN INSTITUTE I'M THINKING

01:20:04.099 --> 01:20:06.502 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT A LIFE CORRESPOND TO

01:20:06.235 --> 01:20:07.736 region:rollup2
WOULD BE.

01:20:06.502 --> 01:20:08.804 region:rollup2
AND WE'RE GONNA MOVE TOWARDS

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:10.472 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHIC BOTTLE SO WHAT IF THE

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:11.473 region:rollup2
CITY OF PASADENA GOT THAT BOB

01:20:10.472 --> 01:20:12.775 region:rollup2
DOLE AND SAID WE'RE GOING TO

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:13.976 region:rollup2
PULL THIS ALL TOGETHER FOR ALL

01:20:12.775 --> 01:20:15.544 region:rollup2
OUR CHILDREN.

01:20:13.976 --> 01:20:16.812 region:rollup2
AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ALL GET

01:20:15.544 --> 01:20:17.913 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOL READY TO LEARN

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:19.915 region:rollup2
WITHOUT A SCHISM WITH MORE

01:20:17.913 --> 01:20:21.917 region:rollup2
PROTECTION.

01:20:19.915 --> 01:20:23.552 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY THINK ABOUT CITIES AS

01:20:21.917 --> 01:20:25.988 region:rollup2
THE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE LIVE AND

01:20:23.552 --> 01:20:26.588 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY WITH CITIES CONTROL THE

01:20:25.988 --> 01:20:33.829 region:rollup2
SOCIAL TRANSPORTATION VARIOUS

01:20:26.588 --> 01:20:34.863 region:rollup2
OTHER

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:36.265 region:rollup2
THINGS AND CITIES WHERE WE

01:20:34.863 --> 01:20:38.834 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GET STUFF DONE.

01:20:36.265 --> 01:20:41.437 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE THINKING ABOUT WHAT

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:44.073 region:rollup2
WENT ON ALL CHILDREN THRIVE CITY

01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:45.374 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE WHERE WE CREATED A WAY

01:20:44.073 --> 01:20:46.475 region:rollup2
OF PULLING THINGS TOGETHER FOR

01:20:45.374 --> 01:20:47.943 region:rollup2
CITIES WHAT IF WE HAD TWENTY

01:20:46.475 --> 01:20:50.479 region:rollup2
THIRTY FORTY OR TWO HUNDRED

01:20:47.943 --> 01:20:52.514 region:rollup2
CITIES IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE'RE

01:20:50.479 --> 01:20:54.383 region:rollup2
ALL MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION.

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:56.085 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING IT RIGHT NOW FOR

01:20:54.383 --> 01:20:57.920 region:rollup2
SOMETHING CALLED HE'LL CITIES

01:20:56.085 --> 01:20:59.521 region:rollup2
HEALTHY EATING ACT OF LIVING

01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:00.656 region:rollup2
CITIES THE KAISER PERMANENTE A

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:01.824 region:rollup2
PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES OF DOING

01:21:00.656 --> 01:21:04.593 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TWENTY TWO HUNDRED.

01:21:01.824 --> 01:21:06.762 region:rollup2
HE'LL CITIES IN CALIFORNIA ANY

01:21:04.593 --> 01:21:08.964 region:rollup2
OF MAYORS AND CITY COUNCILS

01:21:06.762 --> 01:21:10.699 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT HEALTHY EATING

01:21:08.964 --> 01:21:12.101 region:rollup2
ACTIVE LIVING BECAUSE OF THE

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:14.036 region:rollup2
OBESITY EPIDEMIC. WHAT IF WE

01:21:12.101 --> 01:21:14.336 region:rollup2
WERE TO DO THIS FOR WHAT WE'RE

01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:16.438 region:rollup2
DOING NOW?

01:21:14.336 --> 01:21:17.673 region:rollup2
SO.

01:21:16.438 --> 01:21:18.307 region:rollup2
AS I SORT OF LOOK TOWARDS THE

01:21:17.673 --> 01:21:20.376 region:rollup2
FUTURE AND THINK ABOUT POLICY I

01:21:18.307 --> 01:21:20.976 region:rollup2
THINK WE NEED TO HAVE CITIES

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:22.144 region:rollup2
THAT ARE THRIVING THAT WE NEED

01:21:20.976 --> 01:21:24.480 region:rollup2
A.

01:21:22.144 --> 01:21:26.181 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN YEAR.

01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:28.183 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW PROP UP PROGRAM FOR THE

01:21:26.181 --> 01:21:29.985 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IF YOU'D

STATE IS CITIES HAVE TENURE

01:21:29.985 --> 01:21:32.454 region:rollup2
BLUEPRINTS AND WE'RE MOVING

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:32.921 region:rollup2
TOWARDS UNIVERSAL FAMILY

01:21:32.454 --> 01:21:35.324 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS PRESCHOOL AND

01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:36.492 region:rollup2
CHILDCARE.

01:21:35.324 --> 01:21:37.559 region:rollup2
HAD DATA FOR INNOVATION HAD

01:21:36.492 --> 01:21:39.728 region:rollup2
INNOVATIVE FINANCING THAT YOU

01:21:37.559 --> 01:21:41.130 region:rollup2
COULD ALLOW THEM TO DO HAD BUT

01:21:39.728 --> 01:21:42.664 region:rollup2
WERE ABLE TO NETWORK WITH OTHER

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:43.999 region:rollup2
CITIES AND HAVE A COMMON

01:21:42.664 --> 01:21:45.467 region:rollup2
PLATFORM WE WOULD HAVE THE

01:21:43.999 --> 01:21:48.270 region:rollup2
THINGS IN PLACE TO ACTUALLY

01:21:45.467 --> 01:21:50.372 region:rollup2
BUILD THE MOVEMENT TO ACTUALLY

01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:52.274 region:rollup2
TAKE THIS PROBLEM ON.

01:21:50.372 --> 01:21:53.609 region:rollup2
THANK YOU DOCTOR.

PEOPLE HAD OF THE EXPERTS AND SO

01:22:03.051 --> 01:22:07.256 region:rollup2

SO WE WILL. FURTHER HERE OF AN

01:27:49.231 --> 01:27:52.634 region:rollup2

DIDN'T WANT TO COMMENT IF I

01:27:57.372 --> 01:28:01.042 region:rollup2
COULD BECAUSE THE IMPORTANCE FOR

DOWNSTREAM AND.

01:28:14.556 --> 01:28:17.058 region:rollup2
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE I HAVE THREE

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:18.860 region:rollup2
YOUNG KIDS MYSELF BUT NO THE

01:28:17.058 --> 01:28:20.896 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE THAT THESE EARLY

YOUNG YEARS HAVE.

01:28:20.896 --> 01:28:24.599 region:rollup2

01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:35.377 region:rollup2
EFFECT OF COMICS STRESS ON.

01:28:33.475 --> 01:28:36.344 region:rollup2
THOSE WHO HAVE YOUNGER RACES MAY

01:28:35.377 --> 01:28:37.279 region:rollup2
LEAD TO DECREASED EDUCATIONAL

01:28:36.344 --> 01:28:39.381 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES.

01:28:37.279 --> 01:28:41.883 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:28:39.381 --> 01:28:44.352 region:rollup2
IDEA IS A POWERFUL ONE IF WE

01:28:41.883 --> 01:28:45.887 region:rollup2

OUR GATE THROUGH TWELVE.

01:28:45.887 --> 01:28:49.024 region:rollup2

01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:50.725 region:rollup2
KIDS WHO START BEHIND STAY

01:28:49.024 --> 01:28:52.127 region:rollup2
BEHIND.

01:28:50.725 --> 01:28:54.362 region:rollup2
AND IF WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

01:28:52.127 --> 01:28:55.897 region:rollup2
HELP THEM TO DEAL WITH THE TOXIC

01:28:54.362 --> 01:28:57.933 region:rollup2
STRESS AT A YOUNGER AGE. I

01:28:55.897 --> 01:29:00.168 region:rollup2
BELIEVE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

01:28:57.933 --> 01:29:01.736 region:rollup2
TO REALLY SOLVE A. CRITICAL

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:03.038 region:rollup2
PIECE OF THE PROBLEM OUR STATE

01:29:01.736 --> 01:29:04.039 region:rollup2
FACES IN EDUCATING OUR

01:29:03.038 --> 01:29:06.141 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES

01:29:04.039 --> 01:29:07.976 region:rollup2
AND THESE ARE MAJOR SYSTEMATIC

01:29:06.141 --> 01:29:10.078 region:rollup2
SHIPS THAT ARE NOT GOING TO BE

01:29:07.976 --> 01:29:12.247 region:rollup2
EASY FOR US AS A STATE.

01:29:10.078 --> 01:29:15.150 region:rollup2
TWO ONE SILO WORDS TO FIGURE OUT

01:29:12.247 --> 01:29:17.285 region:rollup2
HERE TODAY BUT REALLY WANTED TO.

01:29:15.150 --> 01:29:19.287 region:rollup2
HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AMONGST OUR

01:29:17.285 --> 01:29:21.489 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUE SO THAT IT CAN.

01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:23.191 region:rollup2
COME TO OUR THINKING AS WERE

01:29:21.489 --> 01:29:25.093 region:rollup2
TRYING TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:25.627 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD BUT WANTED IF I

01:29:25.093 --> 01:29:27.963 region:rollup2
COULD

01:29:25.627 --> 01:29:29.698 region:rollup2
DOCTOR HELFAND YOU ENDED BY

01:29:27.963 --> 01:29:30.932 region:rollup2
SAYING THAT THERE WERE OTHER

01:29:29.698 --> 01:29:33.201 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES THAT WERE IMPLORING

01:29:30.932 --> 01:29:35.704 region:rollup2
ARE EXPLORING MODELS THAT ARE

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:37.372 region:rollup2
USED AND I'M REALLY FOCUSING IF

01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:40.041 region:rollup2
I CAN ON THE SCALABILITY.

01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:41.576 region:rollup2
HOW DO WE GO FROM ONE COMMUNITY

01:29:40.041 --> 01:29:43.712 region:rollup2
TO EITHER LOOKING AT REGIONAL

01:29:41.576 --> 01:29:45.413 region:rollup2
MODELS OR EXAMPLES BUT WHAT

01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:47.115 region:rollup2
COULD WE AS A STATE BE DOING AND

01:29:45.413 --> 01:29:48.717 region:rollup2
ARE THERE SPECIFIC COUNTRIES

01:29:47.115 --> 01:29:48.984 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT AS YOUR

01:29:48.717 --> 01:29:50.619 region:rollup2
EXPLOITS?

01:29:48.984 --> 01:29:52.654 region:rollup2
YEAH.

01:29:50.619 --> 01:29:54.222 region:rollup2
I THINK THEM TO RESPOND TO BOTH

01:29:52.654 --> 01:29:57.192 region:rollup2
YOUR QUESTIONS THERE ARE.

01:29:54.222 --> 01:29:58.727 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES THAT CAN BE IS THAT

01:29:57.192 --> 01:30:01.263 region:rollup2
LED THE DATA ON THE MONEY YOU'RE

01:29:58.727 --> 01:30:02.864 region:rollup2
REALLY BOTH IMPORTANT DATA BY

01:30:01.263 --> 01:30:03.365 region:rollup2
HAVING MEASURES ON WHOLE

01:30:02.864 --> 01:30:04.799 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

01:30:03.365 --> 01:30:06.167 region:rollup2
WE GET PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT

01:30:04.799 --> 01:30:08.336 region:rollup2
SECTORS TO START TO SEE THE

01:30:06.167 --> 01:30:10.605 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS THE SAME AND THEY

01:30:08.336 --> 01:30:12.474 region:rollup2
START USING THE SAME MEASURE. SO

01:30:10.605 --> 01:30:14.876 region:rollup2
YOU START USING THAT NEEDY AYE

01:30:12.474 --> 01:30:16.378 region:rollup2
THAT HOW HOW ALL OF OUR KIDS ARE

01:30:14.876 --> 01:30:18.146 region:rollup2
DOING WHETHER YOU'RE FROM HEALTH

01:30:16.378 --> 01:30:20.282 region:rollup2
OR EDUCATION OR SOCIAL SERVICE

01:30:18.146 --> 01:30:22.350 region:rollup2
CHILD WELFARE. ALL USING THE

01:30:20.282 --> 01:30:23.285 region:rollup2
SAME MEASURE WHAT WE'RE SEEING

01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:26.121 region:rollup2
IN COMMUNITIES AROUND THE

01:30:23.285 --> 01:30:27.088 region:rollup2
COUNTRY. IS THAT THE CITY STARTS

01:30:26.121 --> 01:30:29.124 region:rollup2
USING A.

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:30.592 region:rollup2
THE PROVIDERS START USING THAT

01:30:29.124 --> 01:30:32.527 region:rollup2
THE PARENTS START USING IT SO

01:30:30.592 --> 01:30:34.329 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU HAVE EVERYBODY USING

01:30:32.527 --> 01:30:36.898 region:rollup2
THE SAME MEASURE YOU'RE TURNING

01:30:34.329 --> 01:30:38.433 region:rollup2
DATA NOT JUST AND INFORMATION.

01:30:36.898 --> 01:30:40.802 region:rollup2
IT BECOMES CURRENCY THAT BECOMES

01:30:38.433 --> 01:30:43.171 region:rollup2
LIKE MONEY IT BECOMES VALUABLE

01:30:40.802 --> 01:30:44.506 region:rollup2
TO EVERYBODY AND IT HAS EXCHANGE

01:30:43.171 --> 01:30:46.308 region:rollup2
VALUE PEOPLE START MAKING

01:30:44.506 --> 01:30:48.276 region:rollup2
DECISIONS. SO ONE WAY TO BREAK

01:30:46.308 --> 01:30:50.145 region:rollup2
DOWN SILOS TO GET EVERYBODY ON

01:30:48.276 --> 01:30:51.746 region:rollup2
THE SAME PAGE ABOUT THE PROBLEM

01:30:50.145 --> 01:30:53.682 region:rollup2
THE OTHER IS OVER IS AROUND THE

01:30:51.746 --> 01:30:55.950 region:rollup2
MONEY ISSUES. AND THERE ARE A

01:30:53.682 --> 01:30:57.585 region:rollup2
WHOLE SET OF STRATEGIES AND

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:59.154 region:rollup2
WAIVERS THROUGH MEDICAID VARIOUS

01:30:57.585 --> 01:31:00.522 region:rollup2
OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:30:59.154 --> 01:31:02.691 region:rollup2
EXPLORING AND ARE DOING ALL OVER

01:31:00.522 --> 01:31:04.092 region:rollup2
THE COUNTRY AND. TRYING THAT WE

01:31:02.691 --> 01:31:05.593 region:rollup2
COULD BE DOING HERE THE

01:31:04.092 --> 01:31:08.063 region:rollup2
COUNTRIES THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:31:05.593 --> 01:31:10.465 region:rollup2
WORKING MOST CLOSELY WITH OR

01:31:08.063 --> 01:31:12.867 region:rollup2
CANADA AND AUSTRALIA. AND THAT

01:31:10.465 --> 01:31:15.070 region:rollup2
CAN'T AUSTRALIA RIGHT NOW

01:31:12.867 --> 01:31:17.472 region:rollup2
MEASURES EVERY SINGLE FIVE YEAR

01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:19.874 region:rollup2
OLD WHEN THEY START SCHOOL USING

01:31:17.472 --> 01:31:22.344 region:rollup2
THAT SAME MEASURE THAT I WAS

01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:25.180 region:rollup2
SHOWING. AND THEY MEASURE THEIR

01:31:22.344 --> 01:31:27.983 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL CAR GOING OF

01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:29.684 region:rollup2
SOCIAL BALLOTS THAT HEALTH OF

01:31:27.983 --> 01:31:32.020 region:rollup2
AND DEVELOPMENT OF EVERY FIVE

01:31:29.684 --> 01:31:33.021 region:rollup2
YEAR OLD. IT PREDICTS.

01:31:32.020 --> 01:31:34.356 region:rollup2
THEIR THIRD GRADE AND.

01:31:33.021 --> 01:31:35.290 region:rollup2
READING AND MATH SCORE SO AND

01:31:34.356 --> 01:31:36.925 region:rollup2
WE'VE JUST DONE A STUDY IN

01:31:35.290 --> 01:31:38.326 region:rollup2
ORANGE COUNTY WITH GREG DUNCAN.

01:31:36.925 --> 01:31:39.361 region:rollup2
WE WERE WE DID THE SAME

01:31:38.326 --> 01:31:40.428 region:rollup2
MEASUREMENT WENT PREDICTS

01:31:39.361 --> 01:31:41.229 region:rollup2
THE KIDS AND ORANGE COUNTY'S SO

01:31:40.428 --> 01:31:42.864 region:rollup2
YOU GET THE START TO SEE WHAT

01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:44.499 region:rollup2
YOUR KIDS ARE DOING SO THERE'S A

01:31:42.864 --> 01:31:47.569 region:rollup2
DATA YOU CAN SEE. AND IN CANADA

01:31:44.499 --> 01:31:49.404 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THEY NOT ONLY MEASURE

01:31:47.569 --> 01:31:51.306 region:rollup2
THE IN VANCOUVER IN BRITISH

01:31:49.404 --> 01:31:53.675 region:rollup2
COLUMBIA THEY MEASURE ALL KIDS

01:31:51.306 --> 01:31:55.744 region:rollup2
AT AGE FIVE. THEY HAVE ANOTHER

01:31:53.675 --> 01:31:57.445 region:rollup2
MEASURE THAT IT'S DOWN AT AGE

01:31:55.744 --> 01:31:59.147 region:rollup2
NINE AND ANOTHER ELEVEN IN THE.

01:31:57.445 --> 01:32:00.982 region:rollup2
GETTING WHAT FOR FIFTEEN SO THEY

01:31:59.147 --> 01:32:02.984 region:rollup2
CAN MEASURE TRAJECTORIES OF

01:32:00.982 --> 01:32:04.219 region:rollup2
CHILDREN AND THEY THEN INTEGRATE

01:32:02.984 --> 01:32:06.221 region:rollup2
THE DATA WITH ALL THEIR

01:32:04.219 --> 01:32:06.988 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE DATA AND PERSONAL

01:32:06.221 --> 01:32:08.623 region:rollup2
DATA.

01:32:06.988 --> 01:32:10.558 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S GOING ON HERE IN

01:32:08.623 --> 01:32:12.460 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ALSO I WAS AT A

01:32:10.558 --> 01:32:13.628 region:rollup2
MEETING JUST LAST WEEK WITH THE

01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:16.264 region:rollup2
INTER OPERATIVE KEPT

01:32:13.628 --> 01:32:18.199 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE. SILICON VALLEY.

01:32:16.264 --> 01:32:20.769 region:rollup2
HOUSE EIGHT SILICON VALLEY

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:22.704 region:rollup2
REGIONAL DATA TRUST THAT'S TAKEN

01:32:20.769 --> 01:32:24.072 region:rollup2
ALL THE SCHOOL DATA CHILD

01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:26.041 region:rollup2
WELFARE DUE TO MENTAL HEALTH

01:32:24.072 --> 01:32:27.509 region:rollup2
DATA AND IT'S ALL BEING COMBINED

01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:30.078 region:rollup2
TOGETHER SO IT'S STARTING TO

01:32:27.509 --> 01:32:31.980 region:rollup2
BREAK DOWN THE SILOS TO DO THAT.

01:32:30.078 --> 01:32:34.315 region:rollup2
SO ALL OVER THE WORLD PEOPLE ARE

01:32:31.980 --> 01:32:35.150 region:rollup2
TRYING TO BREAK DOWN SILOS.

01:32:34.315 --> 01:32:36.885 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S IN ENGLAND OR

01:32:35.150 --> 01:32:39.020 region:rollup2
AUSTRALIA CANADA AND THERE'S

01:32:36.885 --> 01:32:40.655 region:rollup2
OTHER STRATEGIES SO YOU YOU

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:43.024 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE TO REINVENT THE WHEEL

01:32:40.655 --> 01:32:43.925 region:rollup2
SOME OF IT IS SORT OF HARVESTING

01:32:43.024 --> 01:32:45.193 region:rollup2
IN DOING THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:32:43.925 --> 01:32:47.295 region:rollup2
SCREENING OUT. AND SORT OF SEEN

01:32:45.193 --> 01:32:48.830 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THE BEST PRACTICES AND

01:32:47.295 --> 01:32:50.532 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCHCOULD

01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:51.366 region:rollup2
GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS BRINGING

01:32:50.532 --> 01:32:54.102 region:rollup2
YOU THAT INFORMATION.

01:32:51.366 --> 01:32:56.538 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:32:54.102 --> 01:32:58.039 region:rollup2
SOMEONE ANOTHER CARD. YES THANK

01:32:56.538 --> 01:32:59.340 region:rollup2
YOU AND I KNOW WE HAVE IT.

01:32:58.039 --> 01:33:01.376 region:rollup2
ANOTHER PANEL ON THAT

01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:04.079 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS POINT OF VIEW AND

01:33:01.376 --> 01:33:05.547 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS AND SO YOU KNOW IT.

01:33:04.079 --> 01:33:06.247 region:rollup2
JUMPED THERE BUT WHAT I WILL ASK

01:33:05.547 --> 01:33:07.849 region:rollup2
I WILL ASK YOU THIS AND SO.

01:33:06.247 --> 01:33:09.751 region:rollup2
.

01:33:07.849 --> 01:33:11.119 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW CERTAINLY AS WE SEE

01:33:09.751 --> 01:33:13.088 region:rollup2
FROM THE SLIDES AND AND THANK

01:33:11.119 --> 01:33:14.422 region:rollup2
YOU FOR JUST BREAKING IT DOWN IN

01:33:13.088 --> 01:33:15.890 region:rollup2
PLAIN ENGLISH TO TO IT TO US AS

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:16.091 region:rollup2
FAR AS HOW THE BRAIN WORKS.

01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:18.326 region:rollup2
BUT.

01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:19.394 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE HOT THE HIGHER THE

01:33:18.326 --> 01:33:20.695 region:rollup2
SCORED HIGHER THE IMPACTSTHE

01:33:19.394 --> 01:33:22.096 region:rollup2
MORE NEGATIVE THINGS CAN HAPPEN

01:33:20.695 --> 01:33:23.665 region:rollup2
LATER IN LIFE IT AND YOU SEE

01:33:22.096 --> 01:33:26.267 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS LATER LIKE PROBABLY

01:33:23.665 --> 01:33:27.268 region:rollup2
STUFF A TEN YEAR OLD HAS A.

01:33:26.267 --> 01:33:28.803 region:rollup2
HAS A SEVENTIES SCORE MAYBE

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:30.805 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:33:28.803 --> 01:33:33.041 region:rollup2
LIKE THE GARAGE ON FIRE

01:33:30.805 --> 01:33:34.976 region:rollup2
DOING YOU KNOW THAT STUFF AND IN

01:33:33.041 --> 01:33:36.644 region:rollup2
THERE YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON

01:33:34.976 --> 01:33:38.279 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU CALLED THE YOU KNOW

01:33:36.644 --> 01:33:40.215 region:rollup2
RED ALERT TO YOU KNOW FIRED

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:41.983 region:rollup2
ENGINE COMES AND. PUTS OUT THE

01:33:40.215 --> 01:33:42.617 region:rollup2
FIRE WHAT WHAT HAVE YOU.

01:33:41.983 --> 01:33:43.618 region:rollup2
WHERE IS IF YOU'RE A THREE YEAR

01:33:42.617 --> 01:33:45.353 region:rollup2
OLD?

01:33:43.618 --> 01:33:46.221 region:rollup2
YOU COULD SELL THAT FEAR IN THE

01:33:45.353 --> 01:33:48.389 region:rollup2
FIGHTER FLIGHT IT'S HARDEST TO

01:33:46.221 --> 01:33:50.592 region:rollup2
SEE THAT.

01:33:48.389 --> 01:33:51.659 region:rollup2
SO JUSTIN IN YOUNG IN ME I I'VE

01:33:50.592 --> 01:33:52.894 region:rollup2
ALWAYS WONDERED THIS LIKE YOU

01:33:51.659 --> 01:33:54.629 region:rollup2
KNOW I I HAD LITTLE KIDS AND

01:33:52.894 --> 01:33:55.763 region:rollup2
THEIR TWINS IN THE COULDN'T.

01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:56.698 region:rollup2
THEY WEREN'T SPEAKING RIGHT AWAY

01:33:55.763 --> 01:33:58.132 region:rollup2
SO INTO THE PEDIATRICIANS LOCAL

01:33:56.698 --> 01:33:59.434 region:rollup2
MAYBE THEY CAN'T HEAR.

01:33:58.132 --> 01:34:00.869 region:rollup2
ANOTHER TO SPEAK IN THAT WHEN

01:33:59.434 --> 01:34:02.504 region:rollup2
TALKS OVER THAT THAT THREE OR

01:34:00.869 --> 01:34:03.738 region:rollup2
FOUR.

01:34:02.504 --> 01:34:05.373 region:rollup2
THEY WENT WE WENT TO GO SEE A

01:34:03.738 --> 01:34:07.208 region:rollup2
SPECIALIST TO SEE IF WE NEED TO

01:34:05.373 --> 01:34:09.477 region:rollup2
GET IN THE ALTAR REGIONAL YOU

01:34:07.208 --> 01:34:11.846 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT.

01:34:09.477 --> 01:34:12.580 region:rollup2
I'M NOT SURE IT'S CALLED.

01:34:11.846 --> 01:34:13.381 region:rollup2
AND SO I'M I JUST ALWAYS

01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:14.315 region:rollup2
WONDERED IT WILL IF YOU HAVE A

01:34:13.381 --> 01:34:16.417 region:rollup2
THREE YEAR OLD AND DID YOU HAVE

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:18.153 region:rollup2
A FIVE ACES SCORE WIDE ISN'T

01:34:16.417 --> 01:34:20.588 region:rollup2
THAT WHY DO WE HAVE JUST LIKE. A

01:34:18.153 --> 01:34:22.524 region:rollup2
RED BUTTON GOING OFF AND THEN WE

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:23.658 region:rollup2
CALL THE HOTLINE AND THEN WE

01:34:22.524 --> 01:34:25.460 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT WE CAN WELL FIRST YET

01:34:23.658 --> 01:34:26.461 region:rollup2
THAT SCREENING FOR THAT WHICH IS

01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:28.563 region:rollup2
I GUESS.

01:34:26.461 --> 01:34:30.732 region:rollup2
THE CONDITION. BUT THEN YOU KNOW

01:34:28.563 --> 01:34:32.233 region:rollup2
THE INTERVENTIONS THAT TREATMENT

01:34:30.732 --> 01:34:33.968 region:rollup2
AND SO FORTH SO HOW IS IT SO

01:34:32.233 --> 01:34:36.704 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED THAT WE THAT WE

01:34:33.968 --> 01:34:38.306 region:rollup2
CAN'T. FIND THESE LITTLE KIDS

01:34:36.704 --> 01:34:41.176 region:rollup2

HAVE. A REALLY HIGH SCORE AND.

01:34:41.176 --> 01:34:44.812 region:rollup2
AND HAVE SOME TYPE OF ALERT

01:34:43.111 --> 01:34:47.415 region:rollup2
SYSTEM GOING OFFER PROSTITUTE IN

01:34:44.812 --> 01:34:48.049 region:rollup2
ROLE THESE KIDS IN SOME TYPE OF.

01:34:47.415 --> 01:34:49.584 region:rollup2
TREATMENT IS GOING TO HELP THEIR

01:34:48.049 --> 01:34:51.920 region:rollup2
SIX.

01:34:49.584 --> 01:34:54.289 region:rollup2
WELL.

01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:56.157 region:rollup2
WE DO SEE HER. AND A SKILLED

01:34:54.289 --> 01:34:57.659 region:rollup2
EARLY CHILDHOOD TEACHER.

SEES THE RED LIGHTS GOING OFF

01:34:57.659 --> 01:35:00.828 region:rollup2
ALL THE TIME MIGHT MY WIFE IS

01:34:59.394 --> 01:35:02.797 region:rollup2
ONE OF THOSE EDUCATORS SHE IS

01:35:00.828 --> 01:35:04.599 region:rollup2
PART OF WHAT INFORMS.

01:35:02.797 --> 01:35:06.401 region:rollup2
PRACTICALLY THE RESEARCH THAT I

01:35:04.599 --> 01:35:08.670 region:rollup2
WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

01:35:06.401 --> 01:35:09.137 region:rollup2
IT'S A CHILD WHO IS ARE OUT OF

01:35:08.670 --> 01:35:11.339 region:rollup2
CONTROL WITH PHYSICAL

01:35:09.137 --> 01:35:13.575 region:rollup2
AGGRESSION.

01:35:11.339 --> 01:35:14.943 region:rollup2
OUR IT'S A THREE YEAR OLD WHOSE

01:35:13.575 --> 01:35:16.344 region:rollup2
WAY OF EXPRESSING FRUSTRATION IS

01:35:14.943 --> 01:35:17.579 region:rollup2
TO BY OTHER KIDS.

01:35:16.344 --> 01:35:19.514 region:rollup2
OR IT CAN BE A CHILD WHO IS

01:35:17.579 --> 01:35:20.882 region:rollup2
WITHDRAWN.

01:35:19.514 --> 01:35:22.584 region:rollup2
ARE MORE THAN JUST THE SHALL I

01:35:20.882 --> 01:35:24.052 region:rollup2
DISCOVERED CHILD WHO'S JUST

01:35:22.584 --> 01:35:25.920 region:rollup2
TEMPERAMENTALLY.

01:35:24.052 --> 01:35:27.689 region:rollup2
INHIBITED BUT THE CHILD WHO

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:29.390 region:rollup2
WITHDRAWS FROM ACTIVITIES THAT

01:35:27.689 --> 01:35:31.492 region:rollup2
OTHER KIDS WOULD ENJOY DOING.

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:33.494 region:rollup2
ARM IT'S A CHILD WHO HAS

01:35:31.492 --> 01:35:35.530 region:rollup2
DISTORTED ATTACHMENTS TO PARENTS

01:35:33.494 --> 01:35:36.164 region:rollup2
IF PART OF THEIR FACES ARE

01:35:35.530 --> 01:35:37.865 region:rollup2
COMING FROM WHAT'S HAPPENING AT

01:35:36.164 --> 01:35:39.267 region:rollup2
HOME.

01:35:37.865 --> 01:35:40.468 region:rollup2
AREN'T. YOU KNOW THE ADOLESCENTS

01:35:39.267 --> 01:35:42.837 region:rollup2
WHO ARE IN TROUBLE DRAW OUR

01:35:40.468 --> 01:35:44.606 region:rollup2
ATTENTION BECAUSE THAT SOMETIMES

01:35:42.837 --> 01:35:46.774 region:rollup2
NOT ALWAYS BUT SOMETIMES THEY

01:35:44.606 --> 01:35:47.375 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN CONTACT THAT CONDUCT

01:35:46.774 --> 01:35:48.309 region:rollup2
THAT COMES TO THE ATTENTION OF

01:35:47.375 --> 01:35:49.510 region:rollup2
AUTHORITIES.

01:35:48.309 --> 01:35:50.411 region:rollup2
THE PART OF THE REASON THAT THE

01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:51.613 region:rollup2
TEACHERS THAT I WORK WITH ARE

01:35:50.411 --> 01:35:53.348 region:rollup2
SAYING THEY'RE REALLY CONCERNED

01:35:51.613 --> 01:35:55.650 region:rollup2
IS THEY'RE SEEING THE RED LIGHTS

01:35:53.348 --> 01:35:56.251 region:rollup2
GOING OFF. IN THE THREE YEAR OLD

01:35:55.650 --> 01:35:58.486 region:rollup2
SON THAT THEIR CARRY FOR BUT

01:35:56.251 --> 01:36:01.222 region:rollup2
WHAT ABOUT THE RED LIGHT FIRST

01:35:58.486 --> 01:36:02.724 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW EITHER MAYBE KID SAID

01:36:01.222 --> 01:36:04.525 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL PATIENTS OR WHAT. GONNA

01:36:02.724 --> 01:36:07.195 region:rollup2
GOES TO THE LOCAL. PEDIATRICIAN

01:36:04.525 --> 01:36:08.796 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE DOING. AT THE BACK

01:36:07.195 --> 01:36:11.165 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AISER MAKE TRACKS AND

01:36:08.796 --> 01:36:12.533 region:rollup2
WHEN SOMEONE ADDS UP TO FIVE OR

01:36:11.165 --> 01:36:15.470 region:rollup2
MORE IT GOES IN A SPECIAL FILE

01:36:12.533 --> 01:36:15.970 region:rollup2
NEW AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT.

01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:17.105 region:rollup2
YOUNGSTER IN THAT FAMILY

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:18.172 region:rollup2
HAS

01:36:17.105 --> 01:36:20.842 region:rollup2
SOME TYPE IT EXTRA BENEFIT LIKE

01:36:18.172 --> 01:36:22.910 region:rollup2
WE DO IF YOU CAN HEAR YOU CAN'T

01:36:20.842 --> 01:36:24.879 region:rollup2
SEE WE SET OUR HEARTS GOOD

01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:26.414 region:rollup2
VERSUS GOOD FOR SOCIETY TO

01:36:24.879 --> 01:36:28.149 region:rollup2
INVEST EARLIER IN THE SAGA.

01:36:26.414 --> 01:36:28.783 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT'S WHAT WE DO

01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:30.685 region:rollup2
EVERYDAY AT THE CENTER FOR YOUTH

01:36:28.783 --> 01:36:32.820 region:rollup2
WELL THAT'S BUT I WILL TELL YOU

01:36:30.685 --> 01:36:34.856 region:rollup2
WE ARE ENTIRELY PRIVATELY

01:36:32.820 --> 01:36:36.257 region:rollup2
PHILOSOPHICALLY FUND HEAD WE DO

01:36:34.856 --> 01:36:37.625 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE WE RAY THAT OUT OF

01:36:36.257 --> 01:36:39.127 region:rollup2
MONEY TO DO IT AND.

01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:40.561 region:rollup2
AND WE DO IT TO BE ABLE TO PILOT

01:36:39.127 --> 01:36:41.663 region:rollup2
THE TH MODEL SO THAT WE CAN

01:36:40.561 --> 01:36:43.131 region:rollup2
EVALUATE THEM AND RECOMMEND THEM

01:36:41.663 --> 01:36:44.599 region:rollup2
AS BEST PRACTICES. BUT THAT IS

01:36:43.131 --> 01:36:46.534 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS BECAUSE I

01:36:44.599 --> 01:36:48.536 region:rollup2
WILL TELL YOU THAT THAT THE.

01:36:46.534 --> 01:36:50.605 region:rollup2
THAT THREE YEAR OLD CHILD HIT

01:36:48.536 --> 01:36:52.807 region:rollup2
THAT I HAD THE EXAMPLE THAT I

01:36:50.605 --> 01:36:54.309 region:rollup2
GAVE UP WHO WASN'T GROWING. HER

01:36:52.807 --> 01:36:56.444 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT WAS NORMAL HER

01:36:54.309 --> 01:36:57.879 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR WAS NORMAL SOME KIDS

01:36:56.444 --> 01:37:01.849 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:36:57.879 --> 01:37:03.151 region:rollup2
AT BEANO WITHDRAWAL AT. THAT

01:37:01.849 --> 01:37:04.585 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH IN TERMS

01:37:03.151 --> 01:37:05.920 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL SEVEN TIMES AT CETERA

01:37:04.585 --> 01:37:07.155 region:rollup2
AND SOME KIDS HAVE FREQUENT

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:10.124 region:rollup2
INFECTION IN FACT THAT

01:37:07.155 --> 01:37:11.926 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR CHILD HER YOUNGER

01:37:10.124 --> 01:37:13.127 region:rollup2
BROTHER WHO IS NINE MONTHS AT

01:37:11.926 --> 01:37:15.697 region:rollup2
THE TIME. HOW THAT AND A SCORE

01:37:13.127 --> 01:37:17.832 region:rollup2
OF FIVE HE HAD HAD TO PNEUMONIAS

01:37:15.697 --> 01:37:19.801 region:rollup2
AND FOR AARON FACTIONS WITHIN

01:37:17.832 --> 01:37:22.170 region:rollup2
HIS FIRST YEAR OF LIFE AND AFTER

01:37:19.801 --> 01:37:22.370 region:rollup2
WE STARTED THIS TO GENERATION

01:37:22.170 --> 01:37:25.139 region:rollup2
ALL?

01:37:22.370 --> 01:37:26.774 region:rollup2
THAT INTERVENTION TRAUMA

01:37:25.139 --> 01:37:28.876 region:rollup2
INFORMED INTERVENTION HE DIDN'T

01:37:26.774 --> 01:37:31.279 region:rollup2
HAVE A SINGLE OTHER INVASIVE

01:37:28.876 --> 01:37:33.314 region:rollup2
INFECTION HE HAD NO EAR

01:37:31.279 --> 01:37:36.250 region:rollup2
INFECTIONS NO PNEUMONIAS.

01:37:33.314 --> 01:37:39.787 region:rollup2
FOLLOWING THAT AND SO WE NEED

01:37:36.250 --> 01:37:42.223 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO OFTENTIMES THE

01:37:39.787 --> 01:37:45.159 region:rollup2
KIDS WHO HAVE BEHAVIORAL ISSUES

01:37:42.223 --> 01:37:45.693 region:rollup2
ARE THE ONES WHO ARE RECOGNIZED.

01:37:45.159 --> 01:37:46.661 region:rollup2
THE KIDS WHO DON'T HAVE

01:37:45.693 --> 01:37:47.462 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL ISSUES OR THE KIDS

01:37:46.661 --> 01:37:48.629 region:rollup2
WHO ARE OFTEN PREVERBAL.

01:37:47.462 --> 01:37:50.598 region:rollup2
WE DON'T RECOGNIZE THEM UNTIL

01:37:48.629 --> 01:37:53.368 region:rollup2
THE UNTIL THE PROCESS IS PRETTY

01:37:50.598 --> 01:37:54.902 region:rollup2
FAR GONE AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED

01:37:53.368 --> 01:37:57.305 region:rollup2
TO SCREEN EVERY CHILD AS PER A

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:59.874 region:rollup2
ROUTINE PART OF PEDIATRIC CARE.

01:37:57.305 --> 01:38:01.242 region:rollup2
AND HOW WE DO THAT A HAS TO DO

01:37:59.874 --> 01:38:02.410 region:rollup2
IT YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW WE'RE

01:38:01.242 --> 01:38:04.011 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT.

01:38:02.410 --> 01:38:07.048 region:rollup2
CHANGES TO EP SPT THERE TO

01:38:04.011 --> 01:38:09.117 region:rollup2
THINK THAT I CAN RECOMMEND TO

01:38:07.048 --> 01:38:10.084 region:rollup2
THERE'S SO THERE'S ONE.

01:38:09.117 --> 01:38:10.752 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THAT AT A CERTAIN POINT

01:38:10.084 --> 01:38:11.886 region:rollup2
WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO DRAW A

01:38:10.752 --> 01:38:13.054 region:rollup2
LINE IN THE SAND AND SAY EVERY

01:38:11.886 --> 01:38:15.289 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER IN

01:38:13.054 --> 01:38:17.525 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW BY WHATEVER

01:38:15.289 --> 01:38:18.426 region:rollup2
THE YEAR IS TWENTY TWENTY YOU

01:38:17.525 --> 01:38:19.894 region:rollup2
NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE PROTOCOL

01:38:18.426 --> 01:38:20.795 region:rollup2
THAT HOW TO SCREEN AND RESPOND

01:38:19.894 --> 01:38:23.464 region:rollup2
TO IT AND.

01:38:20.795 --> 01:38:25.199 region:rollup2
TO ACES IN YOUR PRIMARY CARE

01:38:23.464 --> 01:38:28.536 region:rollup2
SETTING RIGHT SO YOU KNOW GIVE

01:38:25.199 --> 01:38:29.070 region:rollup2
FOLKS TIME TO BE ABLE TO BUY.

01:38:28.536 --> 01:38:29.670 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW LEARN THE BEST

01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:31.105 region:rollup2
PRACTICES AND TRAIN AND TRAIN

01:38:29.670 --> 01:38:33.341 region:rollup2
THEIR STAFF BUT THAT'S REALLY

01:38:31.105 --> 01:38:35.409 region:rollup2
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. AND YOU

01:38:33.341 --> 01:38:36.544 region:rollup2
KNOW THE WAY WE CONNECT SOME OF

01:38:35.409 --> 01:38:38.646 region:rollup2
THESE LINKS TO OUR SYSTEMS AND

01:38:36.544 --> 01:38:39.814 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'M NOT A POP POLICY

01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:41.416 region:rollup2
SPECIALIST I'M A PEDIATRICIAN I

01:38:39.814 --> 01:38:43.117 region:rollup2
RUN MY ORGANIZATION BUT. YOU

01:38:41.416 --> 01:38:44.318 region:rollup2
KNOW THING THINGS LIKE FOR

01:38:43.117 --> 01:38:45.987 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THERE'S A PIECE OF PAPER

01:38:44.318 --> 01:38:48.456 region:rollup2
THAT SAYS IN ORDER TO GET INTO

01:38:45.987 --> 01:38:50.024 region:rollup2
SCHOOL EVERY CHILD HAS TO HAVE A

01:38:48.456 --> 01:38:50.892 region:rollup2
IT OR TO GET INTO KINDERGARTEN

01:38:50.024 --> 01:38:51.893 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO HAVE A PHYSICAL.

01:38:50.892 --> 01:38:54.395 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO HAVE THEIR

01:38:51.893 --> 01:38:55.563 region:rollup2
IMMUNIZATIONS THEY HAVE TO HAVE

01:38:54.395 --> 01:38:59.500 region:rollup2
A TB TEST AND THAT FORM SHOULD

01:38:55.563 --> 01:39:00.568 region:rollup2
SAY THEY ALSO HAVE TO HAPPEN A

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:01.169 region:rollup2
SCREEN.

01:39:00.568 --> 01:39:03.237 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE TO PUT

01:39:01.169 --> 01:39:05.373 region:rollup2
THE SCORE JUST THAT A PRIMARY

01:39:03.237 --> 01:39:07.275 region:rollup2
CARE CLINICIAN WHETHER IT'S A

01:39:05.373 --> 01:39:08.543 region:rollup2
FAMILY PRACTITIONER PEDIATRICIAN

01:39:07.275 --> 01:39:09.977 region:rollup2
OR A NURSE PRACTITIONER WHOEVER.

01:39:08.543 --> 01:39:11.813 region:rollup2
HAS SCREEN THAT CHILD FOR A SAYS

01:39:09.977 --> 01:39:14.615 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHAT THAT ALLOWS US TO

01:39:11.813 --> 01:39:17.118 region:rollup2
DO IS TO CREATE NUMBER ONE A

01:39:14.615 --> 01:39:19.153 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHERE THE CHILD IS NOT

01:39:17.118 --> 01:39:21.456 region:rollup2
BEING SCREENS. FOR A SAYS THAT

01:39:19.153 --> 01:39:23.357 region:rollup2
AT THEIR AT EVERY VENUE RITE

01:39:21.456 --> 01:39:24.392 region:rollup2
AID'S WHERE WHEN THAT SCREENING

01:39:23.357 --> 01:39:26.394 region:rollup2
IS MEANINGFUL. THEY HAVE THE

01:39:24.392 --> 01:39:27.695 region:rollup2
LEGAL PROTECTION SO THAT WHEN

01:39:26.394 --> 01:39:30.565 region:rollup2
PARENTS ARE DISCLOSING THE THINK

01:39:27.695 --> 01:39:31.766 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S PROTECTED BY HIPAA.

01:39:30.565 --> 01:39:36.704 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND.

01:39:31.766 --> 01:39:36.904 region:rollup2
WE ALSO HAVE A AND. A MECHANISM

01:39:36.704 --> 01:39:40.007 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:39:36.904 --> 01:39:41.676 region:rollup2
BOTH MORAL ETHICAL AND LEGAL

01:39:40.007 --> 01:39:43.477 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY RIGHT THAT THEY

01:39:41.676 --> 01:39:44.879 region:rollup2
WHEN WHEN A CLINICIAN WHETHER

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:47.148 region:rollup2
IT'S A DOCTOR OR.

01:39:44.879 --> 01:39:49.150 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW PRIMARY CARE CLINICIAN

01:39:47.148 --> 01:39:52.119 region:rollup2
THAT WHEN THEY SCREEN.

01:39:49.150 --> 01:39:54.021 region:rollup2
WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE TRAINED TO

01:39:52.119 --> 01:39:56.624 region:rollup2
AND UNDERSTAND I'M WHAT THE

01:39:54.021 --> 01:39:58.459 region:rollup2
IMPACT IS BOTH ON HEALTH.

01:39:56.624 --> 01:40:00.428 region:rollup2
AND ON MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL

01:39:58.459 --> 01:40:02.497 region:rollup2
HEALTH AND ON DEVELOPMENT AND IT

01:40:00.428 --> 01:40:03.664 region:rollup2
IS OUR JOB TO SCREEN SURVEY THAT

01:40:02.497 --> 01:40:05.166 region:rollup2
AND FOLLOW IT UP AND THE GREAT

01:40:03.664 --> 01:40:07.668 region:rollup2
THING ABOUT SCREENING IN PRIMARY

01:40:05.166 --> 01:40:10.805 region:rollup2
CARE. IS THAT WE FOLLOW CHILDREN

01:40:07.668 --> 01:40:13.941 region:rollup2
FROM THE TIME THEY'RE ZERO UNTIL

01:40:10.805 --> 01:40:15.576 region:rollup2
THEY'RE YOU KNOW I THOUGHT SOME

01:40:13.941 --> 01:40:16.644 region:rollup2
TWENTY YEAR OLD THE MY PACKETS

01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:18.980 region:rollup2
RIGHT FIND ANOTHER DOCTOR. GREAT

01:40:16.644 --> 01:40:21.482 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS WE HAVE BOTH A OUT A

AND.

01:45:10.237 --> 01:45:11.872 region:rollup2
THOUGHT THAT WAS REALLY

01:45:10.771 --> 01:45:12.907 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO DO BECAUSE ALL

THESE KIDS WERE FLYING UNDER THE

01:45:12.907 --> 01:45:18.078 region:rollup2
RADAR IN GETTING TH SCHOOL

01:45:13.440 --> 01:45:19.380 region:rollup2
SCREEN KIDS WE DO NOT HAVE

01:45:18.078 --> 01:45:22.283 region:rollup2

HAS A A PROGRAM AND A SERVICE

01:45:33.594 --> 01:45:37.064 region:rollup2
CENTER THAT'S IT IT'S AN

01:45:34.094 --> 01:45:37.631 region:rollup2
OUTLINE.

01:45:37.064 --> 01:45:40.034 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY ELSE IT DOESN'T

01:45:37.631 --> 01:45:41.202 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE SERVICES AND WHEN

01:45:40.034 --> 01:45:41.769 region:rollup2

01:53:32.873 --> 01:53:36.543 region:rollup2
DOCTORS DON'T TREAT THESE THINGS

01:53:34.307 --> 01:53:38.445 region:rollup2
RIGHT THERAPIST. AND SOCIAL

NEAR ENOUGH STOCKS.

01:53:44.918 --> 01:53:47.254 region:rollup2
YOU COULD TAKE ALL OF THE

01:53:46.153 --> 01:53:48.755 region:rollup2

CURRENTLY IN TRAINING.

01:53:48.755 --> 01:53:51.892 region:rollup2
AND THEY WOULD BE SWALLOWED BY

01:53:49.856 --> 01:53:52.726 region:rollup2
KAISER ALONE.

01:53:51.892 --> 01:53:54.695 region:rollup2

PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN WE HAVE

01:53:56.897 --> 01:53:59.132 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT NEW WAYS NOW GO

THROUGH A COUPLE.

01:53:59.132 --> 01:54:01.268 region:rollup2
AND PARTICULARLY ADOLESCENTS

01:54:00.300 --> 01:54:02.235 region:rollup2

PRIMERICA UTILIZATION OF ANY

DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP.

01:54:04.771 --> 01:54:06.773 region:rollup2

01:54:37.404 --> 01:54:40.073 region:rollup2
UNDERPERFORMING AND IT'S NOT

01:54:39.172 --> 01:54:41.208 region:rollup2
JUST OTHER NATIONS THAT AND THAT

01:54:40.073 --> 01:54:43.977 region:rollup2
I NEED TO POINT OUT HERE. THERE

01:54:41.208 --> 01:54:45.112 region:rollup2
ARE THREE STATES LEFT IN THE

01:54:43.977 --> 01:54:45.779 region:rollup2

FROM THE REST OF HEALTHCARE

01:54:58.058 --> 01:55:04.164 region:rollup2
SYSTEM JUST THREE OKAY.

01:55:00.927 --> 01:55:05.365 region:rollup2
I GUESS PRIEST I IN FACT

01:55:04.164 --> 01:55:08.502 region:rollup2

FIFTEEN BE WAIVER.

01:55:13.573 --> 01:55:18.578 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHES A IT'S ACTUALLY

01:55:17.744 --> 01:55:19.980 region:rollup2
CALLED FREEDOM OF CHOICE WEBER

01:55:18.578 --> 01:55:21.481 region:rollup2
BUT IT ESTABLISHES THE AUTHORITY

01:55:19.980 --> 01:55:22.516 region:rollup2
FOR COUNTIES TO RUN THE MENTAL

01:55:21.481 --> 01:55:23.049 region:rollup2
HEALTH BENEFITS SEPARATE

01:55:22.516 --> 01:55:23.884 region:rollup2
DISTINCT FROM MANAGED CARE

PLANS.

01:55:23.884 --> 01:55:26.520 region:rollup2
SO THAT MECHANICS AND STRUCTURE

01:55:25.685 --> 01:55:28.021 region:rollup2
IS DO WHAT FOR NEGOTIATION AND

01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:29.022 region:rollup2

SAY WE DON'T NEED ANYMORE NICE

01:56:37.824 --> 01:56:40.961 region:rollup2
CHRISTMAS TREE ORNAMENTS ON A

01:56:39.292 --> 01:56:42.429 region:rollup2
DEAD TREE RIGHT LET'S LET'S TAKE

01:56:40.961 --> 01:56:43.630 region:rollup2
A LOOK AT THE TREE AND WATER IT

01:56:42.429 --> 01:56:44.664 region:rollup2
AND GOT RIGHT.

01:56:43.630 --> 01:56:45.265 region:rollup2
SO YOUR CURRENT FRAGMENTATION

01:56:44.664 --> 01:56:45.832 region:rollup2
THAT YOU ALL SPOKE TO IS THIS

01:56:45.265 --> 01:56:46.700 region:rollup2
FEDERAL STATE DEVOLUTION TO

01:56:45.832 --> 01:56:47.501 region:rollup2
COUNTIES.

01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:48.168 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE THE PLACE WHERE THE

01:56:47.501 --> 01:56:48.735 region:rollup2
STATE AND FEDERAL DOLLARS BECOME

01:56:48.168 --> 01:56:50.537 region:rollup2
A SERVICE OR A CONTRACT FOR

01:56:48.735 --> 01:56:51.838 region:rollup2
SERVICE.

01:56:50.537 --> 01:56:52.372 region:rollup2
SORT FOR A THINK LEGISLATORS

01:56:51.838 --> 01:56:53.273 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THIS IT REALLY

01:56:52.372 --> 01:56:54.441 region:rollup2
ESSENTIAL.

01:56:53.273 --> 01:56:55.442 region:rollup2
AND THE SYSTEMS LIKE A CHILD

01:56:54.441 --> 01:56:56.409 region:rollup2
WELFARE SYSTEM IS ADMINISTERED

01:56:55.442 --> 01:56:57.010 region:rollup2
AT THE COUNTY LEVEL.

01:56:56.409 --> 01:56:58.678 region:rollup2
WITH STATE AND FEDERAL DOLLARS

01:56:57.010 --> 01:57:00.380 region:rollup2
THAT BECOME A CONTRACTOR SERVICE

01:56:58.678 --> 01:57:01.815 region:rollup2
AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND THE

01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:03.350 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS BE A CHILD WELFARE

01:57:01.815 --> 01:57:04.084 region:rollup2
JUVENILE JUSTICE OR EDUCATION

01:57:03.350 --> 01:57:04.951 region:rollup2
AND I SHOULD HAVE ADDED THE

01:57:04.084 --> 01:57:05.685 region:rollup2
REGIONAL CENTER SO I'LL DO THAT

01:57:04.951 --> 01:57:06.953 region:rollup2
NEXT TIME.

01:57:05.685 --> 01:57:09.656 region:rollup2
THESE ARE FOUR DISTINCT SYSTEMS

01:57:06.953 --> 01:57:12.592 region:rollup2
BUT ONE HOPE THAT WE HAVE IS

01:57:09.656 --> 01:57:13.526 region:rollup2
THAT ALL I DID ADDED THANK YOU.

01:57:12.592 --> 01:57:14.828 region:rollup2
THEY ALSO INCLUDE A MENTAL

01:57:13.526 --> 01:57:15.962 region:rollup2
HEALTH BENEFITS

01:57:14.828 --> 01:57:17.731 region:rollup2
IF INTERESTING IF YOU LOOK OF

01:57:15.962 --> 01:57:18.598 region:rollup2
HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE OVER THE

01:57:17.731 --> 01:57:19.966 region:rollup2
WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CHO FOR

01:57:18.598 --> 01:57:21.301 region:rollup2
JUVENILE JUSTICE THERE'SA

01:57:19.966 --> 01:57:22.435 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT FOR BEHAVE A LEVEL

01:57:21.301 --> 01:57:24.871 region:rollup2
OF BEHAVIOR HOW SUPPORT. AND

01:57:22.435 --> 01:57:27.474 region:rollup2
EVERY CHILD SERVING SYSTEM.

01:57:24.871 --> 01:57:29.309 region:rollup2
EXCEPT NO ONE SAYS WHAT IT IS.

01:57:27.474 --> 01:57:30.577 region:rollup2
IT JUST IT'S BRIGHT.

01:57:29.309 --> 01:57:33.046 region:rollup2
SO IF WE HAD A NEW FRAMEWORK AND

01:57:30.577 --> 01:57:33.647 region:rollup2
WE TO FIND WHAT IT WAS USING THE

01:57:33.046 --> 01:57:34.080 region:rollup2
NEW SCIENCE OF BASIS AND BRAIN

01:57:33.647 --> 01:57:35.115 region:rollup2
SCIENCE.

01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:36.249 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO

01:57:35.115 --> 01:57:37.417 region:rollup2
TRANSFORM THE ENTIRE CHILD

01:57:36.249 --> 01:57:39.953 region:rollup2
SERVING SAFETY NET.

01:57:37.417 --> 01:57:40.553 region:rollup2
IF WE TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY LOOK

01:57:39.953 --> 01:57:41.354 region:rollup2
AT CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH IN

01:57:40.553 --> 01:57:43.390 region:rollup2
ANY WAY.

01:57:41.354 --> 01:57:45.392 region:rollup2
SO WHILE THERE ARE THE TERRIBLE

01:57:43.390 --> 01:57:47.460 region:rollup2
NUMBERS AT A SHOW YOU ABOUT THE

01:57:45.392 --> 01:57:48.428 region:rollup2
CURRENT PERFORMANCE ARE ACCIONES

01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:50.163 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW SYSTEM.

01:57:48.428 --> 01:57:51.364 region:rollup2
IT LOOKED AT AS AN OPPORTUNITY

01:57:50.163 --> 01:57:52.766 region:rollup2
LIKE THE OBSTACLE IS THE WAY IT

01:57:51.364 --> 01:57:53.633 region:rollup2
COULD BE A MOMENT. USING FEDERAL

01:57:52.766 --> 01:57:56.202 region:rollup2
WAIVER OPPORTUNITY ON SPENT

01:57:53.633 --> 01:57:57.103 region:rollup2
STATE DOLLARS

01:57:56.202 --> 01:57:58.071 region:rollup2
TRANSFORM THE EXPENSE OF

01:57:57.103 --> 01:57:59.573 region:rollup2
CHILDREN ARE SAFETY NET AND GET

01:57:58.071 --> 01:58:01.074 region:rollup2
TO A BROAD SOCIAL MOVEMENT LIKE

01:57:59.573 --> 01:58:03.009 region:rollup2
THE ONE WE HEARD ABOUT EARLIER.

01:58:01.074 --> 01:58:04.177 region:rollup2
AND THAT HAS TO BE SAID WHO'S IN

01:58:03.009 --> 01:58:06.079 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM I WON'T GO THROUGH

01:58:04.177 --> 01:58:07.547 region:rollup2
THESE YOU'VE HEARD THIS HORRIBLE

01:58:06.079 --> 01:58:08.815 region:rollup2
DATA BEFORE.

01:58:07.547 --> 01:58:10.617 region:rollup2
THESE ARE LARGELY POOR KIDS

01:58:08.815 --> 01:58:12.652 region:rollup2
LARGELY POOR KIDS OF COLOR WHO

01:58:10.617 --> 01:58:14.988 region:rollup2
ARE SUSPENDED REFERRED TO

01:58:12.652 --> 01:58:16.289 region:rollup2
PROBATION OR IN FOSTER CARE.

01:58:14.988 --> 01:58:17.390 region:rollup2
AND THESE HARSH REALITIES MEAN

01:58:16.289 --> 01:58:18.158 region:rollup2
THAT THIRTY FOUR PERCENT OF

01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:19.426 region:rollup2
YOUTH EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS

01:58:18.158 --> 01:58:20.827 region:rollup2
AFTER LEAVING FOSTER CARE.

01:58:19.426 --> 01:58:22.729 region:rollup2
FORTY FOUR PERCENT OF YOUTH

01:58:20.827 --> 01:58:24.264 region:rollup2
ARRESTED AFTER THE FOSTER CARE

01:58:22.729 --> 01:58:24.798 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FOUR PERCENT OF YOU THAT

01:58:24.264 --> 01:58:26.533 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T JUST SYSTEM ARE

01:58:24.798 --> 01:58:27.434 region:rollup2
REARRESTED. AND WE RANK THIRTY

01:58:26.533 --> 01:58:28.702 region:rollup2
NINTH AT SCHOOL SPENDING PER

01:58:27.434 --> 01:58:29.035 region:rollup2
PUPIL AND THIRTIETH AND SCHOOL

01:58:28.702 --> 01:58:31.905 region:rollup2
ACHIEVEMENT.

01:58:29.035 --> 01:58:35.976 region:rollup2
IN THE NATION.

01:58:31.905 --> 01:58:36.610 region:rollup2
AND I NEED ALSO FEEL RESPONSIBLE

01:58:35.976 --> 01:58:39.446 region:rollup2
AS A SOME IS DONE THIS WORK TO

01:58:36.610 --> 01:58:40.046 region:rollup2
NAME THE REALITY OF STRUCTURAL

01:58:39.446 --> 01:58:41.381 region:rollup2
RACISM IN THE STATE'S POSITION

01:58:40.046 --> 01:58:42.615 region:rollup2
POVERTY.

01:58:41.381 --> 01:58:45.485 region:rollup2
I'M SEVEN OUT OF TEN CHILDREN

01:58:42.615 --> 01:58:46.920 region:rollup2
BORN INTO POVERTY NEVER GET OUT.

01:58:45.485 --> 01:58:48.588 region:rollup2
SO THE EXAMPLES FROM ALAMEDA

01:58:46.920 --> 01:58:49.789 region:rollup2
COUNTY THAT I WON A HIGHLY ARE

01:58:48.588 --> 01:58:51.191 region:rollup2
HOW WE USE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AS

01:58:49.789 --> 01:58:52.592 region:rollup2
A WAY TO TRANSFORM THESE THREE

01:58:51.191 --> 01:58:53.860 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS JUVENILE JUSTICE CHILD

01:58:52.592 --> 01:58:56.496 region:rollup2
WELFARE EDUCATION AND I'M GONNA

01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:57.964 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON EDUCATION.

01:58:56.496 --> 01:58:59.866 region:rollup2
BUT JUST A COMIC QUICKLY IN OUR

01:58:57.964 --> 01:59:01.868 region:rollup2
JOURNAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.

01:58:59.866 --> 01:59:03.903 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WE OPENED UP

01:59:01.868 --> 01:59:05.772 region:rollup2
A NEW JUVENILE HALL WE BUST FOUR

01:59:03.903 --> 01:59:07.540 region:rollup2
HUNDRED EIGHT KIDS UP TO IT.

01:59:05.772 --> 01:59:09.442 region:rollup2
SIX YEARS LATER AFTER DOUBLING

01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:10.210 region:rollup2
THE MENA HOUSE STAFF AND.

01:59:09.442 --> 01:59:12.379 region:rollup2
DURING A TWELVE MILLION DOLLAR

01:59:10.210 --> 01:59:15.048 region:rollup2
EXPANSION SERVICES THERE ARE

01:59:12.379 --> 01:59:16.616 region:rollup2
SIXTY SEVEN KIDS IN OUR CURRENT

01:59:15.048 --> 01:59:19.319 region:rollup2
JUVENILE JUSTICE CENTER SO FROM

01:59:16.616 --> 01:59:21.688 region:rollup2
FOREIGNER NAY TO SIXTY SEVEN

01:59:19.319 --> 01:59:22.522 region:rollup2
KIDS IN DETENTION.

01:59:21.688 --> 01:59:24.157 region:rollup2
AND CHILD WELFARE DURING THAT

01:59:22.522 --> 01:59:25.458 region:rollup2
SAME PERIOD OF TIME WE WENT FROM

01:59:24.157 --> 01:59:26.192 region:rollup2
FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED CHILDREN IN

01:59:25.458 --> 01:59:27.727 region:rollup2
OUT OF HOME PLACEMENT OVER

01:59:26.192 --> 01:59:29.796 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN HUNDRED TODAY.

01:59:27.727 --> 01:59:30.430 region:rollup2
NOW THAT'S NOT JUST PAPER HEALTH

01:59:29.796 --> 01:59:31.064 region:rollup2
BUT OF COURSE BEHAVIOR HEALTH

01:59:30.430 --> 01:59:32.632 region:rollup2
WAS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF

01:59:31.064 --> 01:59:33.800 region:rollup2
THAT EXPERMENT.

01:59:32.632 --> 01:59:34.968 region:rollup2
AND WE ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST

01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:39.005 region:rollup2
PENETRATION RATE IN CHILD

01:59:34.968 --> 01:59:42.442 region:rollup2
pEIGHTY PERCENT OF ALL CHILDREN

01:59:39.005 --> 01:59:42.976 region:rollup2
AND COUNTY COUNTY CHILD WELFARE

01:59:42.442 --> 01:59:44.210 region:rollup2
SYSTEM RECEIVED AMOUNT OF

01:59:42.976 --> 01:59:45.011 region:rollup2
SERVICE.

01:59:44.210 --> 01:59:46.279 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S EDUCATION WHERE WE HAD

01:59:45.011 --> 01:59:47.380 region:rollup2
THE MOST SUCCESS AND IN THIS

01:59:46.279 --> 01:59:49.382 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN YEAR PERIOD TWO THOUSAND

01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:51.284 region:rollup2
TO TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN.

01:59:49.382 --> 01:59:53.787 region:rollup2
NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND I WAS

01:59:51.284 --> 01:59:54.721 region:rollup2
WORKING ACCIONES OAKLAND US OF

01:59:53.787 --> 01:59:55.789 region:rollup2
RANSOM SOCIAL WORKER AND SO WAS

01:59:54.721 --> 01:59:58.658 region:rollup2
TREATING KIDS OF THAT FORTY

01:59:55.789 --> 01:59:59.492 region:rollup2
EIGHT TWENTY FOUR.

01:59:58.658 --> 02:00:00.660 region:rollup2
AND THEN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN OF

01:59:59.492 --> 02:00:02.629 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH DIRECTOR I HAD BEEN

02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:03.029 region:rollup2
FUNDING THE EXPANSION OF THE

02:00:02.629 --> 02:00:04.164 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

02:00:03.029 --> 02:00:07.133 region:rollup2
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE TEN

02:00:04.164 --> 02:00:09.202 region:rollup2
THOUSAND CHILDREN WHO GOT

02:00:07.133 --> 02:00:10.103 region:rollup2
SERVICE GOT IT IN SCHOOL BECAUSE

02:00:09.202 --> 02:00:11.871 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE KIDS ARE RIGHT.

02:00:10.103 --> 02:00:12.439 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT CHALLENGE OF

02:00:11.871 --> 02:00:14.741 region:rollup2
INCREASING CONCENTRATION OF

02:00:12.439 --> 02:00:16.609 region:rollup2
POVERTY IN PUBLIC EDUCATION.

02:00:14.741 --> 02:00:18.378 region:rollup2
A LOT OF MORE MORE POOR KIDS IN

02:00:16.609 --> 02:00:19.079 region:rollup2
THE SAME PLACE THAT'S IT THAT'S

02:00:18.378 --> 02:00:20.580 region:rollup2
IN MANY WAYS A NEGATIVE BUT IT'S

02:00:19.079 --> 02:00:22.582 region:rollup2
ALSO A BENEFIT BECAUSE THAT

02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:23.950 region:rollup2
MEANS YOU CAN PAY FOR SERVICES

02:00:22.582 --> 02:00:25.752 region:rollup2
FOR THEM UNDER MEDICAID. IF YOU

02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:27.387 region:rollup2
KNOW HOW TO USE IT.

02:00:25.752 --> 02:00:29.355 region:rollup2
SO NINETEEN NINETY SIX THERE

02:00:27.387 --> 02:00:31.725 region:rollup2
WERE FOUR SCHOOL HAS SCHOOL

02:00:29.355 --> 02:00:33.059 region:rollup2
HEALTH CENTERS ALL STARTED BY

02:00:31.725 --> 02:00:35.295 region:rollup2
DOCTOR BARBARA STAGGERS BY THE

02:00:33.059 --> 02:00:36.496 region:rollup2
WAY OF A MENTOR OF MINE AND AND

02:00:35.295 --> 02:00:38.932 region:rollup2
FROM CHáVEZ OAKLAND.

02:00:36.496 --> 02:00:39.899 region:rollup2
AND BY CREATIVELY FINANCING THE

02:00:38.932 --> 02:00:42.535 region:rollup2
BRICKS AND MORTAR WAS SCHOOL

02:00:39.899 --> 02:00:43.803 region:rollup2
BONDS SOAP SCHOOL BONDS OF THE

02:00:42.535 --> 02:00:44.337 region:rollup2
MOST POPULAR TAX IMAGE OF

02:00:43.803 --> 02:00:44.971 region:rollup2
AMERICA THAT WAS PASSED.

02:00:44.337 --> 02:00:51.978 region:rollup2
WE WENT FROM AND WE HOPE TO FIND

02:00:44.971 --> 02:00:55.115 region:rollup2
THE NEXUS

02:00:51.978 --> 02:00:56.483 region:rollup2
OF

02:00:55.115 --> 02:00:57.650 region:rollup2
WHAT HEALTH A PUBLIC EDUCATION

02:00:56.483 --> 02:00:58.852 region:rollup2
AGAIN WOULD YOU SCHOOL BONDS TO

02:00:57.650 --> 02:00:59.986 region:rollup2
PAY FOR THE BRICKS AND MORTAR.

02:00:58.852 --> 02:01:00.787 region:rollup2
FOR THE CLINICS

02:00:59.986 --> 02:01:04.190 region:rollup2
WE USE MEDICAID TO PAY FOR

02:01:00.787 --> 02:01:07.060 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE SERVICES

02:01:04.190 --> 02:01:10.230 region:rollup2
THAT AN OPERATIONAL SUPPORTS AT

02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:11.965 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOL CLINICS NEEDED.

02:01:10.230 --> 02:01:13.199 region:rollup2
NEVER HAVE THAT AGAIN I DROP IT.

02:01:11.965 --> 02:01:14.801 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SOME.

02:01:13.199 --> 02:01:15.401 region:rollup2
FROM MEDICAID.

02:01:14.801 --> 02:01:17.303 region:rollup2
ALL YOUR SERVICES ARE TIED TO

02:01:15.401 --> 02:01:19.973 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSTIC

02:01:17.303 --> 02:01:23.076 region:rollup2
CRITERIA RIGHT AND A LOT OF

02:01:19.973 --> 02:01:24.410 region:rollup2
THESE KIDS AS YOU HEARD EARLIER

02:01:23.076 --> 02:01:26.746 region:rollup2
HAVE HAD BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO

02:01:24.410 --> 02:01:28.748 region:rollup2
THEM THEY'RE NOT PATHOLOGICAL.

02:01:26.746 --> 02:01:30.483 region:rollup2
SO IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT THING

02:01:28.748 --> 02:01:31.317 region:rollup2
THE NAME THAT A LOT OF KIDS ARE

02:01:30.483 --> 02:01:32.852 region:rollup2
JUST POOR OR IT HAD BAD THINGS

02:01:31.317 --> 02:01:33.853 region:rollup2
HAPPEN TO THEM. THEY'RE NOT

02:01:32.852 --> 02:01:34.821 region:rollup2
PATHOLOGICAL ARE NOT SICK.

02:01:33.853 --> 02:01:35.588 region:rollup2
SO THE CHALLENGES OF THIS

02:01:34.821 --> 02:01:36.256 region:rollup2
EXPANSION HAVE BEEN HOW TO

02:01:35.588 --> 02:01:37.223 region:rollup2
BALANCE THE NEED TO GET SERVICES

02:01:36.256 --> 02:01:38.091 region:rollup2
TO KIDS.

02:01:37.223 --> 02:01:40.059 region:rollup2
WITH THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

02:01:38.091 --> 02:01:42.929 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO GENERATE THE REVENUE

TO PAY FOR IT AYE WITH ME.

02:01:42.929 --> 02:01:45.165 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKE A CRITICAL ATTENTION

02:01:43.563 --> 02:01:46.699 region:rollup2
IN THE FIELD.

02:01:45.165 --> 02:01:47.801 region:rollup2
I AM SO WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT

02:01:46.699 --> 02:01:49.569 region:rollup2
CLARA COMPETENCE TO WORK WITH

02:01:47.801 --> 02:01:52.372 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS THE LOCAL HEALTH

02:01:49.569 --> 02:01:53.907 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY HAS TO GET HUMBLE

02:01:52.372 --> 02:01:55.809 region:rollup2
RIGHT IF YOU WALK INTO SCHOOL

02:01:53.907 --> 02:01:59.579 region:rollup2
AND SAY HEY YOU'RE DOING A BAD

02:01:55.809 --> 02:02:00.547 region:rollup2

DOCUMENT AS WE HEARD EARLIER I'M

02:02:11.591 --> 02:02:13.927 region:rollup2
AN ESSENTIAL FUNCTION OF THIS

02:02:12.725 --> 02:02:16.963 region:rollup2
WORK IS TO UNDERSTAND WHO GETS

02:02:13.927 --> 02:02:20.200 region:rollup2
WHAT WHEN AND WHERE.

02:02:16.963 --> 02:02:20.833 region:rollup2

THAT'S A FAVOR OF INTERVENTION.

02:02:43.122 --> 02:02:44.724 region:rollup2
WE ALSO KNOW THE TOOL FOR

02:02:43.990 --> 02:02:47.560 region:rollup2
HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT THAT ALL

EXPERIENCE IN THIS IS RIGHT SO

02:02:48.194 --> 02:02:50.029 region:rollup2
ALL CHILDREN COULD BENEFIT FROM

SUPPORT IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT

02:02:50.029 --> 02:02:52.865 region:rollup2
FROM SOMEONE TO TALK TO WHO

02:02:52.332 --> 02:02:53.766 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDS THEIR NEEDS.

02:02:52.865 --> 02:02:54.968 region:rollup2
WE DO KNOW THAT SOME NUMBR OF

02:02:53.766 --> 02:02:55.902 region:rollup2
CHILDREN MEET CLINICAL

02:02:54.968 --> 02:02:57.604 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA THERE ARE

02:02:55.902 --> 02:02:58.671 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY MENTALLY ILL KIDS THEY

NEED SERVICES WE NEED TO LOOK AT

02:02:58.671 --> 02:03:00.807 region:rollup2
HOW TO INTEGRATE THEM WITH

REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. AND WE

02:07:30.376 --> 02:07:33.913 region:rollup2
LEARNED A LOT DURING THAT

02:07:31.777 --> 02:07:35.348 region:rollup2
TRAINING I THINK ONE OF THE MOST

02:07:33.913 --> 02:07:36.549 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THINGS IS THAT WHEN

02:07:35.348 --> 02:07:38.184 region:rollup2
YOU DO THAT TRAINING AND WHEN

02:07:36.549 --> 02:07:40.586 region:rollup2

02:07:38.184 --> 02:07:41.487 region:rollup2
WITH IN YOUR ORGANIZATION. YOU

02:07:40.586 --> 02:07:43.122 region:rollup2
WILL HAVE MANY PEOPLE IN YOUR

02:07:41.487 --> 02:07:44.323 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION WHO THEY THEMSELVES

02:07:43.122 --> 02:07:46.859 region:rollup2
HAVE GONE THROUGH DOMESTIC

02:07:44.323 --> 02:07:48.060 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE BOTH NOW AND PERSON WE

02:07:46.859 --> 02:07:49.228 region:rollup2
HAD MANY PEOPLE COME UP TO ME

02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:50.630 region:rollup2
AFTERWARD AND SAID. I DIDN'T

02:07:49.228 --> 02:07:52.365 region:rollup2
REALIZE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WAS

02:07:50.630 --> 02:07:53.699 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS FOR MY CHILD AND THEY

02:07:52.365 --> 02:07:54.167 region:rollup2
LEFT THEIR MARRIAGES THEY GOT

02:07:53.699 --> 02:07:55.368 region:rollup2
INTO SAFE WE GAVE THEM

02:07:54.167 --> 02:07:56.402 region:rollup2
REFERRALS.

02:07:55.368 --> 02:07:57.670 region:rollup2
YOU HAD PEOPLE THAT STOOD IN

02:07:56.402 --> 02:07:58.838 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAD THE TRAINING I STILL

02:07:57.670 --> 02:08:00.106 region:rollup2
SEE THEM THEY'RE STANDING IN THE

02:07:58.838 --> 02:08:03.009 region:rollup2
BACK AND THERE ARE ONE OF MY

02:08:00.106 --> 02:08:03.609 region:rollup2
LEADERS AND I THOUGHT THE REDUCE

02:08:03.009 --> 02:08:04.410 region:rollup2
INTERESTED I WAS VERY UPSET.

02:08:03.609 --> 02:08:05.845 region:rollup2
ONE THING IS YOU HAVE TO LEARN

02:08:04.410 --> 02:08:07.213 region:rollup2
TO BE NON JUDGMENTAL SO THERE I

02:08:05.845 --> 02:08:08.414 region:rollup2
WAS JUDGING THEM WHY ISN'T SHE

02:08:07.213 --> 02:08:10.716 region:rollup2
INVOLVED.

02:08:08.414 --> 02:08:11.751 region:rollup2
JUST YOU KNOW WE'D WE NOW KNOW

02:08:10.716 --> 02:08:13.452 region:rollup2
THAT THOSE WERE PEOPLE WHO

02:08:11.751 --> 02:08:15.254 region:rollup2
COULDN'T REALLY HEAR ABOUT THAT

02:08:13.452 --> 02:08:16.722 region:rollup2
TO HEAR ABOUT THOSE THOSE ACES

02:08:15.254 --> 02:08:18.558 region:rollup2
AND AND THAT ADVERSITY AND THE

02:08:16.722 --> 02:08:19.992 region:rollup2
CHILD ABUSE AND THE DOMESTIC

02:08:18.558 --> 02:08:21.394 region:rollup2
VIOLENCE AND THE INCARCERATION.

02:08:19.992 --> 02:08:23.029 region:rollup2
AND THE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

02:08:21.394 --> 02:08:24.564 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR FAMILIES SO REALLY

02:08:23.029 --> 02:08:26.532 region:rollup2
ASHER DOING THAT TRAINING YOU

02:08:24.564 --> 02:08:28.534 region:rollup2
NEED TO BUILD A SUPPORT SYSTEM

02:08:26.532 --> 02:08:29.869 region:rollup2
FOR YOUR OWN STAFF. IT'S LIKE

02:08:28.534 --> 02:08:31.304 region:rollup2
PUTTING ON YOUR MAP OXYGEN MASK

02:08:29.869 --> 02:08:33.539 region:rollup2
FIRST BEFORE YOU GIVE IT TO YOUR

02:08:31.304 --> 02:08:35.007 region:rollup2
CHILD YOU HAVE TO DO THAT AND

02:08:33.539 --> 02:08:36.342 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE YOU BILL THAT END AND

02:08:35.007 --> 02:08:37.743 region:rollup2
THAT WAS ADVICE I GOT FROM

02:08:36.342 --> 02:08:39.045 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY WHO WAS TRAINING PRISON

02:08:37.743 --> 02:08:40.680 region:rollup2
GUARDS AND TRUMP INFORMED CARE.

02:08:39.045 --> 02:08:41.914 region:rollup2
IN HAWAII WHO I'D MET WITH

02:08:41.914 --> 02:08:44.417 region:rollup2
SHE SAID PEOPLE DON'T TALK ABOUT

02:08:43.316 --> 02:08:45.751 region:rollup2
THIS AND OF SO I REALLY WANT TO

02:08:44.417 --> 02:08:48.254 region:rollup2

02:09:20.786 --> 02:09:23.589 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO

02:09:22.121 --> 02:09:24.690 region:rollup2

A SCREEN TO THAT INTEGRATED MANY

02:09:39.472 --> 02:09:42.408 region:rollup2
OTHER.

02:09:40.006 --> 02:09:43.275 region:rollup2
VALIDATED TOOLS BECAUSE WE

02:09:42.408 --> 02:09:44.910 region:rollup2
DIDN'T WANT TO JUST LOOK AT

02:09:43.275 --> 02:09:46.679 region:rollup2
ADVERSITY WE WANT TO LOOK AT

02:09:44.910 --> 02:09:47.647 region:rollup2
STRENGTHS I'VE. YOU KNOW I'VE

02:09:46.679 --> 02:09:49.882 region:rollup2
COME THROUGH THE STRENGTHS BASED

02:09:47.647 --> 02:09:51.217 region:rollup2
APPROACH IN MY CAREER AND I

02:09:49.882 --> 02:09:52.785 region:rollup2
REALLY BELIEVE IN THE STRENGTH

02:09:51.217 --> 02:09:54.754 region:rollup2
AND RESPECT THE STRENGTH AND

02:09:52.785 --> 02:09:56.322 region:rollup2
RESILIENCY OF OUR OUR PEOPLE

02:09:54.754 --> 02:09:57.990 region:rollup2
THAT WE SERVE AND OUR STAFF. AND

02:09:56.322 --> 02:09:59.859 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

02:09:57.990 --> 02:10:01.427 region:rollup2
REALIZE PEOPLETHAT GO THROUGH

02:09:59.859 --> 02:10:03.796 region:rollup2
EXTREME ADVERSITY ARE VERY

02:10:01.427 --> 02:10:05.665 region:rollup2
STRONG AND VERY RESILIENT THEY

02:10:03.796 --> 02:10:06.999 region:rollup2
NEED HELP BUT THEY HAVE THEY

02:10:05.665 --> 02:10:08.768 region:rollup2
HAVE BLURRED THEY HAVE SURVIVED

02:10:06.999 --> 02:10:09.935 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE GETTING INTO YOUR

02:10:08.768 --> 02:10:11.404 region:rollup2
OFFICE TO BRING THEIR CHILD IN.

02:10:09.935 --> 02:10:12.471 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE TO REALLY RESPECT

02:10:11.404 --> 02:10:13.673 region:rollup2
THAT AND BUILD THAT INTO OUR

02:10:12.471 --> 02:10:15.508 region:rollup2
PRACTICE.

02:10:13.673 --> 02:10:16.909 region:rollup2
SO WE STARTED SCREENING I HAD

02:10:15.508 --> 02:10:18.210 region:rollup2
AND MEDICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WERE

02:10:16.909 --> 02:10:19.412 region:rollup2
UNABLE TO ACTUALLY GIVE OUT THE

02:10:18.210 --> 02:10:20.680 region:rollup2
SCREENING BECAUSE OF TOO CLOSE

02:10:19.412 --> 02:10:21.347 region:rollup2
TO HOME FOR THEM WE HAVE TO

02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:23.482 region:rollup2
RESPECT THAT AND FIGURE OUT HOW

02:10:21.347 --> 02:10:25.318 region:rollup2
TO DO IT. WE HAD DOCTORS THAT

02:10:23.482 --> 02:10:27.019 region:rollup2
WERE UNCOMFORTABLE REVIEWING IT.

02:10:25.318 --> 02:10:28.387 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY WERE FROM

02:10:27.019 --> 02:10:30.289 region:rollup2
A CULTURE WHERE YOU JUST SUCK IT

02:10:28.387 --> 02:10:31.757 region:rollup2
UP AND MOVE ON. AND THAT WAS

02:10:30.289 --> 02:10:32.792 region:rollup2
VERY HARD FOR THEM BUT THEY

02:10:31.757 --> 02:10:34.960 region:rollup2
STARTED GOING TO NATIONAL

02:10:32.792 --> 02:10:36.662 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE'S WE WERE IN AND.

02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:37.997 region:rollup2
THE STATE KIND OF TALKED ABOUT

02:10:36.662 --> 02:10:39.665 region:rollup2
IT WITH US AND THEY'VE REALLY

02:10:37.997 --> 02:10:40.399 region:rollup2
INTEGRATED IT INTO THE TO THE

02:10:39.665 --> 02:10:41.834 region:rollup2
CARE.

02:10:40.399 --> 02:10:43.135 region:rollup2
WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE

02:10:41.834 --> 02:10:44.637 region:rollup2
PLACES TO REFER TO I THINK ONE

02:10:43.135 --> 02:10:46.472 region:rollup2
OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES THAT IS A

02:10:44.637 --> 02:10:47.073 region:rollup2
POLICY ISSUE IS THESE ARE YOUNG

02:10:46.472 --> 02:10:48.307 region:rollup2
CHILDREN THEY'RE ALL UNDER THE

02:10:47.073 --> 02:10:50.643 region:rollup2
AGE OF FOUR.

02:10:48.307 --> 02:10:51.844 region:rollup2

INTERGENERATIONAL. I MEAN IT'S

GENERATIONAL WHEN I WAS KIND OF

02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:24.443 region:rollup2
TALKING TO MY WITH MY PATIENTS

SURE HOW SHE DO THAT WE REFERRED

02:12:00.579 --> 02:12:04.083 region:rollup2
HER TO PLACES SHE CAME BACK

02:12:02.214 --> 02:12:06.085 region:rollup2
LATER SHE ACTUALLY CAME TO OUR

THE TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS BUT

02:12:19.765 --> 02:12:22.601 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

02:12:21.066 --> 02:12:23.803 region:rollup2
GROUP TO LOOK AT. I BELIEVE

02:12:22.601 --> 02:12:26.472 region:rollup2
THERE ARE TWELVE AND I THINK IT

02:12:23.803 --> 02:12:26.739 region:rollup2
COMES FROM RESTITUTION FUNDS OR

02:12:26.472 --> 02:12:28.407 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL.

02:12:26.739 --> 02:12:30.309 region:rollup2

HEALTH PROVIDERS IN TOWN BE.

02:12:41.487 --> 02:12:44.089 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE EXPANSION

THE DYADIC CARE SO THAT'S VERY

02:12:48.527 --> 02:12:51.764 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT BUT IT'S GETTING THEM

02:17:09.922 --> 02:17:13.192 region:rollup2
STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

02:17:11.256 --> 02:17:14.460 region:rollup2
SERVICES IT IS REQUIRED BY

02:17:13.192 --> 02:17:16.428 region:rollup2
EVERYONE WHO HAS MEDI CAL

02:17:14.460 --> 02:17:17.896 region:rollup2
MANAGED CARE AND MEDI CAL SO WE

GIVE IT OUT TO EVERYONE.

02:17:17.896 --> 02:17:23.602 region:rollup2
AND IT HAS QUESTIONS BY AGE IN

02:17:21.366 --> 02:17:24.970 region:rollup2
THE EARLY YEARS IT DOES NOT HAVE

02:17:23.602 --> 02:17:26.505 region:rollup2
MATERNAL DEPRESSION IT DOES NOT

02:17:24.970 --> 02:17:28.340 region:rollup2
HAVE VIOLENCE IN THE HOME IT

02:17:26.505 --> 02:17:30.242 region:rollup2
DOES NOT HAVE HOUSING IN THE

02:17:28.340 --> 02:17:32.211 region:rollup2
SECURITY OR FOOD INSECURITY.

02:17:30.242 --> 02:17:33.812 region:rollup2
WE WE COULD ACT IN THE OLDER AGE

02:17:32.211 --> 02:17:35.981 region:rollup2
AS THEY DO HAVE A LOT OF THAT

02:17:33.812 --> 02:17:37.816 region:rollup2
AND IN THE ADULTS SO I THINK WE

02:17:35.981 --> 02:17:39.752 region:rollup2
COULD ADD TO THAT AND YOURS YOUR

02:17:37.816 --> 02:17:40.853 region:rollup2

COMMENTS WE COULD ADD TO IT BUT

02:17:48.761 --> 02:17:51.463 region:rollup2
I THINK TO SYSTEMATIZE THAT. BUT

02:17:50.529 --> 02:17:52.564 region:rollup2
THE MOST IMPORTANT TO TRAIN

02:17:51.463 --> 02:17:53.999 region:rollup2
PEOPLE IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO

02:17:52.564 --> 02:17:55.701 region:rollup2

02:17:53.999 --> 02:17:57.369 region:rollup2
AN EXISTING TOOL OUT OF THE

02:17:55.701 --> 02:17:59.171 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES.

02:17:57.369 --> 02:18:00.639 region:rollup2
THAT HAS SOME OF THAT I THINK WE

02:17:59.171 --> 02:18:02.007 region:rollup2
NEED TO ASK ABOUT HOUSING AND

02:18:00.639 --> 02:18:03.842 region:rollup2
FOOD INSECURITY IN ADDITION

02:18:02.007 --> 02:18:05.677 region:rollup2

FAMILIES AND HOUSING AND FOOD

02:18:08.413 --> 02:18:11.083 region:rollup2
INSECURITY.

02:18:09.815 --> 02:18:12.851 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY HARD TO BE A LEVINE

02:18:11.083 --> 02:18:14.453 region:rollup2

02:22:32.010 --> 02:22:36.248 region:rollup2
THE MECHANICS OF MATCHING IT.

02:22:33.779 --> 02:22:38.417 region:rollup2
HAPPENS AT THE COUNTY LEVEL.

02:22:36.248 --> 02:22:41.153 region:rollup2
AND THE CAPACITY OF COUNTIES.

02:22:38.417 --> 02:22:41.920 region:rollup2
ARE DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT.

02:22:41.153 --> 02:22:43.522 region:rollup2
SOME COUNTIES A REALLY GOOD

02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:44.756 region:rollup2
POINT ON THAT FEDERAL MATCH WE

02:22:43.522 --> 02:22:45.157 region:rollup2
HAPPEN TO BE GOOD AT IT NOW ME

02:22:44.756 --> 02:22:47.292 region:rollup2
COUNTY. AT GREAT.

02:22:45.157 --> 02:22:47.893 region:rollup2
PREDECESSORS

02:22:47.292 --> 02:22:49.060 region:rollup2
MANY COUNTIES ARE VERY POOR AT

02:22:47.893 --> 02:22:50.128 region:rollup2
IT.

02:22:49.060 --> 02:22:51.596 region:rollup2
SO THE CHALLENGES AND JUST THE

02:22:50.128 --> 02:22:52.564 region:rollup2
STATE SAYING SO IT'S NOT JUST

02:22:51.596 --> 02:22:54.399 region:rollup2
STATE SAYING SO IN GIVING THE

02:22:52.564 --> 02:22:55.634 region:rollup2
MONEY IT'S A STATE SAYING SO

02:22:54.399 --> 02:22:56.935 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE MONEY AND PROVIDING

02:22:55.634 --> 02:22:59.137 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

02:22:56.935 --> 02:23:01.239 region:rollup2
TO EXECUTE.

02:22:59.137 --> 02:23:03.308 region:rollup2
AS LONG WINDED BUT I HOPE.

02:23:01.239 --> 02:23:03.742 region:rollup2
THAT WAS AN ANSWER NO I.

02:23:03.308 --> 02:23:05.710 region:rollup2
I THINK YOUR ANSWER.

02:23:03.742 --> 02:23:07.078 region:rollup2
.

02:23:05.710 --> 02:23:10.348 region:rollup2
A HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE

02:23:07.078 --> 02:23:12.617 region:rollup2
DIFFICULTIES WE HAVE AS A STATE.

02:23:10.348 --> 02:23:16.288 region:rollup2
THAT OFTENTIMES. A ONE SIZE FITS

02:23:12.617 --> 02:23:18.123 region:rollup2
ALL APPROACH DOESN'T WORK FOR.

02:23:16.288 --> 02:23:19.758 region:rollup2
AND EACH INDIVIDUAL COUNTY WHICH

02:23:18.123 --> 02:23:21.293 region:rollup2
IS ATTEMPTING TO PULL DOWN

02:23:19.758 --> 02:23:23.028 region:rollup2
FEDERAL FUNDS AND THE WAY THAT

02:23:21.293 --> 02:23:24.996 region:rollup2
YOU BRING FOR. BUT I ALSO

02:23:23.028 --> 02:23:26.765 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT WE SERVE IN THE

02:23:24.996 --> 02:23:29.334 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE BRANCH. WHICH MEANS

02:23:26.765 --> 02:23:30.469 region:rollup2
WE SPEND PART OF OUR TIME.

02:23:29.334 --> 02:23:32.537 region:rollup2
CONVINCING IN EDUCATING OUR

02:23:30.469 --> 02:23:34.172 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES ON WHAT ARE THE BEST

02:23:32.537 --> 02:23:37.209 region:rollup2
WAYS TO MOVE POLICIES FORWARD

02:23:34.172 --> 02:23:39.077 region:rollup2
AND. I'M IS WHY I'M SO EXCITED

02:23:37.209 --> 02:23:40.579 region:rollup2
FOR TODAY'S TOPIC AND. THIS

02:23:39.077 --> 02:23:41.146 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE

02:23:40.579 --> 02:23:43.315 region:rollup2
SUBJECT IS.

02:23:41.146 --> 02:23:45.250 region:rollup2
UP.

02:23:43.315 --> 02:23:47.252 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHTING WHAT HAS WORKED IN

02:23:45.250 --> 02:23:49.354 region:rollup2
CERTAIN AREAS AND COMMUNITIES

02:23:47.252 --> 02:23:51.156 region:rollup2
AND LOOKING AT IT AS AN EXAMPLE

02:23:49.354 --> 02:23:51.656 region:rollup2
THAT WE AS A STATE COULD LOOK TO

02:23:51.156 --> 02:23:53.592 region:rollup2
REPLICATE OR SCALE YEAH

02:23:51.656 --> 02:23:54.860 region:rollup2
EXERCISE.

02:23:53.592 --> 02:23:56.128 region:rollup2
IF IT IS NOT GOING COVER THE

02:23:54.860 --> 02:23:57.596 region:rollup2
DOCTOR HOW OFTEN MADE THAT PUTS.

02:23:56.128 --> 02:23:59.197 region:rollup2
THAT SO SENSUAL.

02:23:57.596 --> 02:24:01.132 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO DO

02:23:59.197 --> 02:24:03.702 region:rollup2
SOME STUFF AND ALAMEDA COUNTY I

02:24:01.132 --> 02:24:06.838 region:rollup2
DON'T AT ALL SUGGEST THAT THE

02:24:03.702 --> 02:24:08.840 region:rollup2
STORY I TOLD YOU IS THE ANSWER.

02:24:06.838 --> 02:24:10.509 region:rollup2
WHAT UCLA'S DOINGS ANSWER?

02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:13.311 region:rollup2
BUNDLED VALUE BASED PAYMENT WITH

02:24:10.509 --> 02:24:14.613 region:rollup2
A NEW MECHANISM BUT LITERALLY YA

02:24:13.311 --> 02:24:15.981 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO BREAK IT DOWN START

02:24:14.613 --> 02:24:18.149 region:rollup2
HOPE FOR RIGHT THERE'S IT A

02:24:15.981 --> 02:24:18.750 region:rollup2
REINVENTION OF HOW WE DO BEHAVE

02:24:18.149 --> 02:24:19.684 region:rollup2
OUR HOUSE IS ESSENTIAL IN THE

02:24:18.750 --> 02:24:20.886 region:rollup2
STATE.

02:24:19.684 --> 02:24:22.787 region:rollup2
AND THE COUNTIES ON OPTICAL WAY

02:24:20.886 --> 02:24:23.421 region:rollup2
THERE'S A ROLE FOR THEM TO.

02:24:22.787 --> 02:24:24.756 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

02:24:23.421 --> 02:24:26.291 region:rollup2
REINVENTING RESTRUCTURING IT

02:24:24.756 --> 02:24:28.159 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY IN IN THE CONTEXT

02:24:26.291 --> 02:24:29.227 region:rollup2
OF A BROAD SOCIAL MOVEMENT.

02:24:28.159 --> 02:24:30.529 region:rollup2
SO THE DOCTORS WHO SPOKE BEFORE

02:24:29.227 --> 02:24:31.596 region:rollup2
ME THEY HAD IT RIGHT.

02:24:30.529 --> 02:24:32.764 region:rollup2
AND JUST AS I TOLD YOUR STORY

02:24:31.596 --> 02:24:33.798 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW WE DID IT IN ONE PLACE

02:24:32.764 --> 02:24:35.267 region:rollup2
WITH SOME SOPHISTICATED

02:24:33.798 --> 02:24:35.834 region:rollup2
RESOURCES AND DOLLARS I DON'T

02:24:35.267 --> 02:24:37.335 region:rollup2
WANT THAT TO COME OFF AS THE

02:24:35.834 --> 02:24:37.903 region:rollup2
SOLUTION.

02:24:37.335 --> 02:24:39.070 region:rollup2
THAT WAS A WAY OF MITIGATING

02:24:37.903 --> 02:24:39.671 region:rollup2
HARM.

02:24:39.070 --> 02:24:41.173 region:rollup2
THE SOLUTION IS A MUCH BROADER

02:24:39.671 --> 02:24:42.741 region:rollup2
ONE.

02:24:41.173 --> 02:24:45.176 region:rollup2
AND HAVE TO INCLUDE GHS AND IT

02:24:42.741 --> 02:24:45.477 region:rollup2
HAS TO INCLUDE COUNTIES.

02:24:45.176 --> 02:24:47.145 region:rollup2
WITH THAT.

02:24:45.477 --> 02:24:48.914 region:rollup2
WANT TO THANK THIS PANEL FOR

02:24:47.145 --> 02:24:50.882 region:rollup2
COMING FORWARD AND WE WILL MOVE

02:24:48.914 --> 02:24:52.851 region:rollup2
ON TO OUR SECOND PANEL. TO

02:24:50.882 --> 02:24:53.818 region:rollup2
DISCUSS SOLUTIONS MIA I IT JUST

02:24:52.851 --> 02:24:56.021 region:rollup2
TWENTY I PUT IN.

02:24:53.818 --> 02:24:57.689 region:rollup2
FUTURES WITHOUT VIOLENCE THE

02:24:56.021 --> 02:24:59.057 region:rollup2
CHANGING MINDS PREVENT TEEN AND

02:24:57.689 --> 02:25:01.826 region:rollup2
HEALING CHILDHOOD TRAUMA STATE

02:24:59.057 --> 02:25:02.427 region:rollup2
POLICY GUY. ITS STAPLE TO

02:25:01.826 --> 02:25:04.296 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ELSE IN YOUR PACKET

02:25:02.427 --> 02:25:08.700 region:rollup2
SO.

02:25:04.296 --> 02:25:09.234 region:rollup2
GOT IT AGAIN THANK YOU FOR.

02:25:08.700 --> 02:25:11.503 region:rollup2
FIRST WE WILL HAVE DOCTOR

02:25:09.234 --> 02:25:13.271 region:rollup2
COFFER.

02:25:11.503 --> 02:25:15.273 region:rollup2
BY PRONOUNCE THAT CORRECTLY

02:25:13.271 --> 02:25:31.690 region:rollup2
FOLLOWED BY JOHN POWDERS FRANK

02:25:15.273 --> 02:25:31.690 region:rollup2
MECCA AND DONNA SNEERING

02:25:32.591 --> 02:25:33.959 region:rollup2
.

02:25:32.724 --> 02:25:35.327 region:rollup2
REALLY THRILLED TO BE HERE TODAY

02:25:33.959 --> 02:25:37.162 region:rollup2
TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO

02:25:35.327 --> 02:25:38.863 region:rollup2
ABOUT TRAUMA AND BE PART OF THE

02:25:37.162 --> 02:25:40.465 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS WE'VE HEARD SOME

02:25:38.863 --> 02:25:41.733 region:rollup2
PRELIMINARY SOLUTIONS ALREADY.

02:25:40.465 --> 02:25:42.667 region:rollup2
ON BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT

02:25:41.733 --> 02:25:44.703 region:rollup2
MORE TO STILL ADD TO THE

02:25:42.667 --> 02:25:45.870 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND IN PARTICULAR I

02:25:44.703 --> 02:25:47.806 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S GREAT THAT WE'VE HAD

02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:48.373 region:rollup2
SO MANY PANELISTS WHO COME UP

02:25:47.806 --> 02:25:50.141 region:rollup2
AND TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE

02:25:48.373 --> 02:25:51.343 region:rollup2
SCIENCE. ARMIN TALKED ABOUT

02:25:50.141 --> 02:25:52.310 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL TRAUMA BEAT BUT

02:25:51.343 --> 02:25:53.511 region:rollup2
THERE'S ONE THING THAT I THINK

02:25:52.310 --> 02:25:54.679 region:rollup2
THAT WE STILL NEED TO ADD TO THE

02:25:53.511 --> 02:25:57.248 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

02:25:54.679 --> 02:25:58.183 region:rollup2
AND SO. THAT IS THE CHARM HAS TO

02:25:57.248 --> 02:26:00.885 region:rollup2
BE A PRIORITY.

02:25:58.183 --> 02:26:02.220 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT

02:26:00.885 --> 02:26:03.421 region:rollup2
THE WORD I HAVEN'T HEARD.

02:26:02.220 --> 02:26:04.823 region:rollup2
UTTERED AT LEAST ENOUGH TODAY TO

02:26:03.421 --> 02:26:06.391 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT TOXIC STRESS WE

02:26:04.823 --> 02:26:07.859 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT TRAUMA BUT WE HAVE

02:26:06.391 --> 02:26:09.160 region:rollup2
NOT TALKED ABOUT SAFETY.

02:26:07.859 --> 02:26:12.297 region:rollup2
AND HAVE A TALK ABOUT SAFETY AS

02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:13.365 region:rollup2
BEING ONE OF THE QUARRY NEEDS

02:26:12.297 --> 02:26:14.766 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE A WE THINK OF

02:26:13.365 --> 02:26:16.468 region:rollup2
MASSLIVE HIERARCHY OF NEEDS

02:26:14.766 --> 02:26:17.469 region:rollup2
SAFETY IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH

02:26:16.468 --> 02:26:19.170 region:rollup2
WHAT WE NEED.

02:26:17.469 --> 02:26:21.206 region:rollup2
AND SO WE HAVE TO CONSIDER

02:26:19.170 --> 02:26:21.940 region:rollup2
EMOTIONAL SAFETY IN OUR POLICY

02:26:21.206 --> 02:26:23.808 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES.

02:26:21.940 --> 02:26:25.010 region:rollup2
AND AND AS HAS BEEN ALREADY

02:26:23.808 --> 02:26:27.145 region:rollup2
ARTICULATED YOU KNOW THIS IS A

02:26:25.010 --> 02:26:27.746 region:rollup2
RISK FACTOR FOR BEHAVIORAL FOR

02:26:27.145 --> 02:26:28.446 region:rollup2
PHYSICAL AND FOR MENTAL HEALTH

02:26:27.746 --> 02:26:29.347 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES.

02:26:28.446 --> 02:26:30.782 region:rollup2
WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT

02:26:29.347 --> 02:26:32.183 region:rollup2
THIS AND FRAME IT FROM A SAFETY

02:26:30.782 --> 02:26:33.518 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE AND HOW DO WE

02:26:32.183 --> 02:26:35.186 region:rollup2
RESTORE SAFETY BECAUSE A LOT OF

02:26:33.518 --> 02:26:37.122 region:rollup2
WHAT THE BRAIN AND WITH THE BODY

02:26:35.186 --> 02:26:38.556 region:rollup2
IS DOING IS IT'S WAY OF TRYING

02:26:37.122 --> 02:26:39.791 region:rollup2
TO RE ESTABLISH SAFETY. IT'S

02:26:38.556 --> 02:26:42.260 region:rollup2
JUST I JUST HAPPENS TO BE

02:26:39.791 --> 02:26:44.663 region:rollup2
MALADAPTIVE.

02:26:42.260 --> 02:26:46.197 region:rollup2
SO. OPPORTUNITY NUMBER ONE IS

02:26:44.663 --> 02:26:47.065 region:rollup2
IMPROVE DATA COLLECTION AND THIS

02:26:46.197 --> 02:26:49.300 region:rollup2
IS BEEN TALKED ABOUT.

02:26:47.065 --> 02:26:49.934 region:rollup2
INCOME TO DANCE AROUND A LITTLE

02:26:49.300 --> 02:26:50.502 region:rollup2
BIT DOWN IN TERMS OF WHAT WE MAY

02:26:49.934 --> 02:26:52.070 region:rollup2
NEED

02:26:50.502 --> 02:26:53.405 region:rollup2
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE

02:26:52.070 --> 02:26:55.206 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW IS A RETROSPECTIVE

02:26:53.405 --> 02:26:56.341 region:rollup2
SELF REPORT DATA ON ADULTS.

02:26:55.206 --> 02:26:58.143 region:rollup2
SO THE ASUS STUDY THAT WAS

02:26:56.341 --> 02:27:00.111 region:rollup2
INITIALLY DONE WAS THAT WAS IN

02:26:58.143 --> 02:27:00.745 region:rollup2
ADULTS AND WE HAVE A LOT OF DATA

02:27:00.111 --> 02:27:02.280 region:rollup2
ON THAT AND THAT WE HAVE A LOT

02:27:00.745 --> 02:27:03.948 region:rollup2
OF CLINICAL DATA AND A LOT OF

02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:06.718 region:rollup2
RESEARCH ON CHILDREN. BUT WHAT

02:27:03.948 --> 02:27:08.887 region:rollup2
WE NEED IN A MORE SYSTEMATIC WAY

02:27:06.718 --> 02:27:10.689 region:rollup2
IS POPULATION BASED DATA ON

02:27:08.887 --> 02:27:11.990 region:rollup2
CHILDREN SO NODDED POCKETS NOT

02:27:10.689 --> 02:27:13.258 region:rollup2
PER CORRECT PROGRESSIVE CITIES

02:27:11.990 --> 02:27:14.793 region:rollup2
THAT DECIDE THAT THEY'RE GOING%

02:27:13.258 --> 02:27:15.527 region:rollup2
TO SCREEN AT CERTAIN AGES WE

02:27:14.793 --> 02:27:17.062 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TO DO THIS ON AN

02:27:15.527 --> 02:27:18.763 region:rollup2
ONGOING BASIS. AND HAVE

02:27:17.062 --> 02:27:20.198 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR IT AND THE

02:27:18.763 --> 02:27:21.533 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THAT I WOULD USE FOR WHY

02:27:20.198 --> 02:27:23.168 region:rollup2
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT IS THAT WE

02:27:21.533 --> 02:27:24.102 region:rollup2
THINK ABOUT INFANT MORTALITY AND

02:27:23.168 --> 02:27:25.403 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY

02:27:24.102 --> 02:27:26.938 region:rollup2
CONTRIBUTED TO THAT IS THAT

02:27:25.403 --> 02:27:29.607 region:rollup2
EVERY STATE HAS PREMIUMS OR IN

02:27:26.938 --> 02:27:30.575 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA'S CASE THE MATERNAL

02:27:29.607 --> 02:27:31.209 region:rollup2
AND INFANT HEALTH ASSESSMENT.

02:27:30.575 --> 02:27:32.844 region:rollup2
AND THAT ALLOWED US TO BE ABLE

02:27:31.209 --> 02:27:34.379 region:rollup2
LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ISSUE AND

02:27:32.844 --> 02:27:35.714 region:rollup2
GET TO THE HEART OF WHAT'S GOING

02:27:34.379 --> 02:27:37.782 region:rollup2
ON WITHIN FOR MORTALITY WE'VE

02:27:35.714 --> 02:27:39.718 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SEEN MARKED DECREASES

02:27:37.782 --> 02:27:42.187 region:rollup2
IN INFANT MORTALITY BECAUSE WE

02:27:39.718 --> 02:27:43.888 region:rollup2
HAD. THAT ROBUST POPULATION

02:27:42.187 --> 02:27:45.023 region:rollup2
BASED DATA SET AS WELL AS ONE OF

02:27:43.888 --> 02:27:46.558 region:rollup2
THE THINGS WE REALLY NEED TO

02:27:45.023 --> 02:27:47.726 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON IN TERMS OF A PAY

02:27:46.558 --> 02:27:49.494 region:rollup2
CONCRETE NEXT STEP.

02:27:47.726 --> 02:27:51.696 region:rollup2
THE NEXT IS WE NEED TO THINK

02:27:49.494 --> 02:27:53.732 region:rollup2
ABOUT EXPANDED ACES AND SO WE

02:27:51.696 --> 02:27:54.866 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT THESE MEASURES OF

02:27:53.732 --> 02:27:56.334 region:rollup2
YOUR HOUSEHOLD THE COLLECTIVE

02:27:54.866 --> 02:27:58.169 region:rollup2
ABUSE AND DYSFUNCTION BUT WE

02:27:56.334 --> 02:27:58.703 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT ARE SOME OF

02:27:58.169 --> 02:27:59.404 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE

02:27:58.703 --> 02:28:01.206 region:rollup2
CAUSING TRY.

02:27:59.404 --> 02:28:02.774 region:rollup2
LIKE FOSTER CARE SO WE KNOW THAT

02:28:01.206 --> 02:28:03.775 region:rollup2
POVERTY IS ARGUMENT WE TALKED LA

02:28:02.774 --> 02:28:05.176 region:rollup2
FOSTER CARE

02:28:03.775 --> 02:28:06.811 region:rollup2
BEING IN FOSTER CARE IS THE

02:28:05.176 --> 02:28:08.580 region:rollup2
TRAUMA. I'M HAVING A PARENTAL

02:28:06.811 --> 02:28:10.048 region:rollup2
DEATH IS A TRAUMA IT'S NOT

02:28:08.580 --> 02:28:11.883 region:rollup2
INCLUDED IN THE EIGHTH THE STUDY

02:28:10.048 --> 02:28:14.152 region:rollup2
ON DISCIPLINE AND INCARCERATION

02:28:11.883 --> 02:28:15.553 region:rollup2
OF YOURSELF NOT YOUR PARENT ALSO

02:28:14.152 --> 02:28:17.088 region:rollup2
IS NOT INCLUDED IN ACES AND SO

02:28:15.553 --> 02:28:18.823 region:rollup2
WE NEED ALSO BE THINKING ABOUT.

02:28:17.088 --> 02:28:19.791 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE THE OTHER TRAUMAS THAT

02:28:18.823 --> 02:28:21.259 region:rollup2
ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THOSE COURT

02:28:19.791 --> 02:28:22.827 region:rollup2
TEN THAT ARE PREVALENT IN OUR

02:28:21.259 --> 02:28:24.295 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND THAT ARE

02:28:22.827 --> 02:28:25.597 region:rollup2
IMPACTING HEALTH OUTCOMES?

02:28:24.295 --> 02:28:26.798 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE LAST ONE IN THIS IS

02:28:25.597 --> 02:28:28.066 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO GIVE A

02:28:26.798 --> 02:28:29.768 region:rollup2
LOT OF CREDIT TO HOWARD PINTER

02:28:28.066 --> 02:28:31.336 region:rollup2
HUGHES AT UCSF AND MY SHOULD

02:28:29.768 --> 02:28:33.238 region:rollup2
JACKSON FOR FOR TALKING ABOUT

02:28:31.336 --> 02:28:35.774 region:rollup2
ADVANCING ITS ADVERSE COMMUNITY

02:28:33.238 --> 02:28:36.608 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE AS. SO ALSO EXISTS

02:28:35.774 --> 02:28:37.709 region:rollup2
AND THESE ARE THINGS LIKE RACISM

02:28:36.608 --> 02:28:39.778 region:rollup2
AND VIOLENCE AND OTHER THINGS

02:28:37.709 --> 02:28:40.712 region:rollup2
THAT ARE NOT OF NOT NOT ONLY

02:28:39.778 --> 02:28:42.247 region:rollup2
HAPPENING AT THE INDIVIDUAL

02:28:40.712 --> 02:28:44.048 region:rollup2
LEVEL BUT ARE ALSO HAPPENING AT

02:28:42.247 --> 02:28:46.518 region:rollup2
A COMMUNITY LEVEL BUT EVERYONE

02:28:44.048 --> 02:28:48.419 region:rollup2
IS EXPERIENCING. AND MUCH LIKE.

02:28:46.518 --> 02:28:50.121 region:rollup2
LIKE YOU TO USE VIOLENT EXAMPLES

02:28:48.419 --> 02:28:51.356 region:rollup2
MUCH LIKE A BOMB THAT HAS SORT

02:28:50.121 --> 02:28:53.258 region:rollup2
OF AT THE CENTER AND THEN IT

02:28:51.356 --> 02:28:54.392 region:rollup2
RICOCHETS OUT THE SAME THING IS

02:28:53.258 --> 02:28:56.628 region:rollup2
TRUE FOR ADVERSE COMMUNITY

02:28:54.392 --> 02:28:58.763 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES BUT THERE IS A HEAT

02:28:56.628 --> 02:28:59.931 region:rollup2
POINT WHERE. IT DIDN'T IMPACT

02:28:58.763 --> 02:29:01.166 region:rollup2
THE FAMILY IF THERE'S A SHOOTING

02:28:59.931 --> 02:29:02.300 region:rollup2
OR IF THEY'RE IF I'M SOME SORT

02:29:01.166 --> 02:29:03.802 region:rollup2
OF VIOLENCE THAT HAPPENED THERE

02:29:02.300 --> 02:29:06.304 region:rollup2
BUT IT ALSO ECHOES OUT INTO THE

02:29:03.802 --> 02:29:08.139 region:rollup2
REST OF THE COMMUNITY AND WE

02:29:06.304 --> 02:29:09.374 region:rollup2
NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT AS WEL.

02:29:08.139 --> 02:29:11.176 region:rollup2
THE SECOND AND I THINK THIS IS

02:29:09.374 --> 02:29:13.244 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT IS TRAINING IN

02:29:11.176 --> 02:29:14.512 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AND SO I HAVE BEEN I'VE

02:29:13.244 --> 02:29:15.580 region:rollup2
HAD THE PLEASURE OF BEING ABLE

02:29:14.512 --> 02:29:17.215 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH SEVERAL SCHOOL

02:29:15.580 --> 02:29:17.749 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS AS WELL AS THE

02:29:17.215 --> 02:29:19.784 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

02:29:17.749 --> 02:29:21.119 region:rollup2
EDUCATION. ON THE CALIFORNIA

02:29:19.784 --> 02:29:22.420 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATION OF AFRICAN AMERICAN

02:29:21.119 --> 02:29:23.288 region:rollup2
SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS AND

02:29:22.420 --> 02:29:24.856 region:rollup2
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS.

02:29:23.288 --> 02:29:26.758 region:rollup2
AND TALK TO THEM ABOUT ABOUT

02:29:24.856 --> 02:29:28.393 region:rollup2
TRAUMA AND MUCH LIKE MANY OF THE

02:29:26.758 --> 02:29:30.428 region:rollup2
OTHER PANELISTS HAVE SUGGESTED

02:29:28.393 --> 02:29:31.796 region:rollup2
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS NEW.

02:29:30.428 --> 02:29:33.631 region:rollup2
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY

02:29:31.796 --> 02:29:35.066 region:rollup2
THEY. FREQUENTLY WALK AWAY WITH

02:29:33.631 --> 02:29:36.701 region:rollup2
IF THIS IDEA OF WHAT AM I

02:29:35.066 --> 02:29:37.302 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO DO NEXT AND I'M SO

02:29:36.701 --> 02:29:39.037 region:rollup2
GLAD THAT YOU GAVE ME SOME

02:29:37.302 --> 02:29:39.938 region:rollup2
CONCRETE EXAMPLES IN CONCRETE

02:29:39.037 --> 02:29:41.172 region:rollup2
NEXT STEPS.

02:29:39.938 --> 02:29:42.841 region:rollup2
SO ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THOUGH

02:29:41.172 --> 02:29:45.376 region:rollup2
IS THAT WHEN WE NEED TO CHANGE

02:29:42.841 --> 02:29:46.945 region:rollup2
THE FRAME AWAY FROM BAD KIDS.

02:29:45.376 --> 02:29:48.546 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE THINK OF OF CHILDREN

02:29:46.945 --> 02:29:51.282 region:rollup2
AS BEING BAD WE THINK OF THEM AS

02:29:48.546 --> 02:29:53.084 region:rollup2
BEING INHERENTLY PROBLEMATIC WE

02:29:51.282 --> 02:29:54.686 region:rollup2
WE COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS THAT

02:29:53.084 --> 02:29:55.620 region:rollup2
ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE FRAME THAT

02:29:54.686 --> 02:29:57.322 region:rollup2
WE COME UP WHAT WE THINK ABOUT

02:29:55.620 --> 02:29:59.457 region:rollup2
CHILDREN BEING TRAUMATIZED.

02:29:57.322 --> 02:30:01.359 region:rollup2
WE THINK ABOUT THEIR BEHAVIOR AS

02:29:59.457 --> 02:30:01.960 region:rollup2
A WAY TO RESTORE SAFETY WE SEE

02:30:01.359 --> 02:30:03.027 region:rollup2
IT DIFFERENTLY AND WE RESPOND

02:30:01.960 --> 02:30:04.329 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY

02:30:03.027 --> 02:30:06.030 region:rollup2
IF WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT

02:30:04.329 --> 02:30:07.765 region:rollup2
HOW WE CAN INSTITUTIONALIZE

02:30:06.030 --> 02:30:09.334 region:rollup2
TRAINING FOR ADMINISTRATORS FOR

02:30:07.765 --> 02:30:11.035 region:rollup2
TEACHERS AND FOR STAFF ON

02:30:09.334 --> 02:30:13.104 region:rollup2
ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AN

02:30:11.035 --> 02:30:14.873 region:rollup2
ADVERSE COMMUNITY EXPERIENCES.

02:30:13.104 --> 02:30:15.907 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONS

02:30:14.873 --> 02:30:16.975 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ALREADY DOING A LOT OF

02:30:15.907 --> 02:30:18.109 region:rollup2
THIS WORK FEATURES WITH PILOT

02:30:16.975 --> 02:30:19.043 region:rollup2
WITH WITHOUT VIOLENCE HAVE BEEN

02:30:18.109 --> 02:30:20.445 region:rollup2
MENTIONED.

02:30:19.043 --> 02:30:21.846 region:rollup2
ACES CONNECTION OF THE NUMBER

02:30:20.445 --> 02:30:23.047 region:rollup2
ONE THEIR LOCAL CHAPTERS

02:30:21.846 --> 02:30:24.849 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE THEY'RE

02:30:23.047 --> 02:30:26.050 region:rollup2
DOING SOME OF THIS WORK AND THE

02:30:24.849 --> 02:30:28.219 region:rollup2
TRAINING NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED ON

02:30:26.050 --> 02:30:31.489 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY TRAUMA

02:30:28.219 --> 02:30:33.858 region:rollup2
INCLUDING RACISM VIEWS ARE ALL

02:30:31.489 --> 02:30:35.393 region:rollup2
WORKING TOGETHER. AS A CSUS.

02:30:33.858 --> 02:30:36.961 region:rollup2
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS I JUST

02:30:35.393 --> 02:30:38.563 region:rollup2
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT BRIEFLY OR

02:30:36.961 --> 02:30:40.298 region:rollup2
SOME OF WHAT THOSE CONCRETE NEXT

02:30:38.563 --> 02:30:41.499 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTE BOOK LIKE FOR SCHOOLS.

02:30:40.298 --> 02:30:42.867 region:rollup2
I'M A BIG ONE IS RESTORATIVE

02:30:41.499 --> 02:30:45.570 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE HAVE ONE OF THE WAYS

02:30:42.867 --> 02:30:47.472 region:rollup2
IN WHICH WE OFTEN RE TRAUMATIZED

02:30:45.570 --> 02:30:48.506 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IS IN THE WAY IN WHICH

02:30:47.472 --> 02:30:49.974 region:rollup2
WE DISCIPLINE THEM FOR THE

02:30:48.506 --> 02:30:51.576 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORS THAT ARE ACTUALLY

02:30:49.974 --> 02:30:52.610 region:rollup2
SYMPTOMS OF TRAUMA.

02:30:51.576 --> 02:30:54.045 region:rollup2
AND SO WE NEED TO BEGIN TO

02:30:52.610 --> 02:30:55.480 region:rollup2
REALLY TO RETHINK RESTORE WRIST

02:30:54.045 --> 02:30:57.215 region:rollup2
RETHINK OUR DISCIPLINE AND MAKE

02:30:55.480 --> 02:30:58.917 region:rollup2
IT RESTORATIVE AND THIS IS MODEL

02:30:57.215 --> 02:31:01.286 region:rollup2
THE DESIRED BEHAVIOR REPAIRING

02:30:58.917 --> 02:31:03.721 region:rollup2
HARM. TEACHING LESSONS HAVING

02:31:01.286 --> 02:31:05.924 region:rollup2
PROPORTIONAL AND RESPONSIVE.

02:31:03.721 --> 02:31:07.425 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINE FOR FOR BEHAVIOR

02:31:05.924 --> 02:31:08.426 region:rollup2
THINK BEHAVIORS BETTER

02:31:07.425 --> 02:31:10.261 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE HAVE TO BE

02:31:08.426 --> 02:31:10.862 region:rollup2
ADDRESSED BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO

02:31:10.261 --> 02:31:11.496 region:rollup2
BE ADDRESSED IN A WAY THAT'S

02:31:10.862 --> 02:31:12.897 region:rollup2
DRAMATIC.

02:31:11.496 --> 02:31:14.399 region:rollup2
IN THE CAN BE MUTUALLY AGREED

02:31:12.897 --> 02:31:15.900 region:rollup2
UPON SO THERE'S SORT OF THIS

02:31:14.399 --> 02:31:17.635 region:rollup2
CONTINUUM OF PUNITIVE TO

02:31:15.900 --> 02:31:19.737 region:rollup2
PERMISSIVE AND IT OFTEN.

02:31:17.635 --> 02:31:21.072 region:rollup2
CIRCUMVENTS THE RESTORATIVE BUT

02:31:19.737 --> 02:31:23.007 region:rollup2
WE REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON THE

02:31:21.072 --> 02:31:24.242 region:rollup2
UPPER RIGHT QUADRANT EVERYTHING

02:31:23.007 --> 02:31:25.610 region:rollup2
ABOUT BEING RESTORATIVE. THE

02:31:24.242 --> 02:31:28.279 region:rollup2
NEXT IN THIS IS BEEN IMPORTANT

02:31:25.610 --> 02:31:29.547 region:rollup2
IS MENTORSHIPS TO RESTORE SAFETY

02:31:28.279 --> 02:31:30.982 region:rollup2
AHMED SO. AT MAKING SURE THAT WE

02:31:29.547 --> 02:31:32.650 region:rollup2
HAVE THOSE WITHIN SCHOOLS THIS

02:31:30.982 --> 02:31:34.152 region:rollup2
IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR

02:31:32.650 --> 02:31:35.219 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO MAY BE IN FOSTER

02:31:34.152 --> 02:31:36.621 region:rollup2
CARE OR ME.

02:31:35.219 --> 02:31:38.356 region:rollup2
HAVE TRANSIENT LIVING

02:31:36.621 --> 02:31:38.957 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS WHERE A LOT OF THEIR

02:31:38.356 --> 02:31:40.892 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY

02:31:38.957 --> 02:31:42.493 region:rollup2
CONSTANTLY SHIFTING

02:31:40.892 --> 02:31:43.561 region:rollup2
AND SO HAVING AN ESTABLISHMENT

02:31:42.493 --> 02:31:44.963 region:rollup2
OR HAVING SOMEONE YOU CAN CALL

02:31:43.561 --> 02:31:46.631 region:rollup2
WHEN THAT CHILD IS HAVING A BAD

02:31:44.963 --> 02:31:47.532 region:rollup2
DAY. AND BE ABLE TO HAVE BEEN

02:31:46.631 --> 02:31:48.866 region:rollup2
RESTORED SAFETY OF INCREDIBLY

02:31:47.532 --> 02:31:49.934 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

02:31:48.866 --> 02:31:51.502 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE OTHER ONE THAT'S

02:31:49.934 --> 02:31:52.737 region:rollup2
BEEN MENTIONED I REALLY THINK

02:31:51.502 --> 02:31:54.505 region:rollup2
THE PANELISTS FOR FOR BRINGING

02:31:52.737 --> 02:31:56.207 region:rollup2
THAT UP IS HAVING RESOURCES TO

02:31:54.505 --> 02:31:57.609 region:rollup2
MEET BASIC NEEDS WE KNOW THERE'S

02:31:56.207 --> 02:31:57.909 region:rollup2
FOOD INSECURITY WHEN WE KNOW WE

02:31:57.609 --> 02:31:59.777 region:rollup2
HAVE A HIGH.

02:31:57.909 --> 02:32:01.145 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS AND ISSUE IN THE

02:31:59.777 --> 02:32:02.413 region:rollup2
STATE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:32:01.145 --> 02:32:03.715 region:rollup2
WE'RE RESPONSIVE TO THAT IN OUR

02:32:02.413 --> 02:32:05.049 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AND OUR SCHOOLS ARE

02:32:03.715 --> 02:32:06.117 region:rollup2
RESOURCE TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE

02:32:05.049 --> 02:32:07.652 region:rollup2
BACK BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE IT'S

02:32:06.117 --> 02:32:08.186 region:rollup2
GOING TO SHOW UP. AND OFTEN IN

02:32:07.652 --> 02:32:08.820 region:rollup2
OUR YOUNGEST KID THAT HAS

02:32:08.186 --> 02:32:10.355 region:rollup2
BEEN-MENTIONED THAT'S WHERE SOME

02:32:08.820 --> 02:32:12.156 region:rollup2
OF

02:32:10.355 --> 02:32:13.491 region:rollup2
THE SYMPTOMS ARE GOING ON TO BE

02:32:12.156 --> 02:32:15.193 region:rollup2
DISPLAYED IN WAYS THAT WE MAY

02:32:13.491 --> 02:32:16.427 region:rollup2
NOT UNDERSTAND OR MAY NOT

02:32:15.193 --> 02:32:17.729 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZE AS BEING

02:32:16.427 --> 02:32:19.564 region:rollup2
LINKED TO TRAUMA BECAUSE OF THE

02:32:17.729 --> 02:32:22.100 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE THINK ABOUT. AS

02:32:19.564 --> 02:32:23.368 region:rollup2
BEING TRAUMA SYMPTOMS.

02:32:22.100 --> 02:32:25.403 region:rollup2
AND THEN MEMBER THREE AND THIS

02:32:23.368 --> 02:32:26.838 region:rollup2
IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS HOW WE

02:32:25.403 --> 02:32:28.473 region:rollup2
RESPOND TO OUR PREVENT COMMUNITY

02:32:26.838 --> 02:32:30.742 region:rollup2
TRAUMA.

02:32:28.473 --> 02:32:31.576 region:rollup2
AND SO. AS PUBLIC OF ADVOCATES

02:32:30.742 --> 02:32:33.344 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BEEN A.

02:32:31.576 --> 02:32:34.679 region:rollup2
A PROGRAM CALLED THE HEALTHY

02:32:33.344 --> 02:32:36.114 region:rollup2
EATING ACTIVE LIVING CITIES

02:32:34.679 --> 02:32:38.349 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN AND IT'S IN A HUNDRED

02:32:36.114 --> 02:32:40.184 region:rollup2
NINETY CITIES IN CALIFORNIA.

02:32:38.349 --> 02:32:41.452 region:rollup2
AND IT FOCUSES ON HEALTHY

02:32:40.184 --> 02:32:41.953 region:rollup2
EATING AND ACTIVE LIVING BUT WE

02:32:41.452 --> 02:32:42.487 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THERE IS AN

02:32:41.953 --> 02:32:44.188 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND THIS

02:32:42.487 --> 02:32:46.024 region:rollup2
MODEL.

02:32:44.188 --> 02:32:48.059 region:rollup2
AND AND TO BE ABLE TO ALSO

02:32:46.024 --> 02:32:49.193 region:rollup2
FOCUS ON TRAUMA AND ONE OF THE

02:32:48.059 --> 02:32:50.528 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE SEE WHEN THERE

02:32:49.193 --> 02:32:52.030 region:rollup2
ARE TRAUMAS THAT HAPPEN AT THE

02:32:50.528 --> 02:32:53.898 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY LEVEL IS THAT THE CITY

UP TO GOOD AND YOU KNOW WELL

02:33:33.137 --> 02:33:34.972 region:rollup2
MEANING CITIZENS THAT SHOULD BE

02:33:34.572 --> 02:33:36.074 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT'S

02:33:34.972 --> 02:33:37.341 region:rollup2
INSTITUTIONALIZED AS PART OF

02:33:36.074 --> 02:33:38.776 region:rollup2
THAT WAS.

02:33:37.341 --> 02:33:39.610 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT THAT GOES ALONG TO

02:33:38.776 --> 02:33:41.045 region:rollup2
THE RESPONSE PROTOCOLS OF HOW DO

02:33:39.610 --> 02:33:42.547 region:rollup2
WE

02:33:41.045 --> 02:33:43.748 region:rollup2
FRAME THE ISSUES HOW DO WE MAKE

02:33:42.547 --> 02:33:45.016 region:rollup2
SURE WE ADDRESS THEM IN AN

02:33:43.748 --> 02:33:45.983 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE WAY THAT DOESN'T

02:33:45.016 --> 02:33:48.886 region:rollup2
TRAUMATIZE.

02:33:45.983 --> 02:33:50.121 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES IN THE AFTERMATH OF.

02:33:48.886 --> 02:33:51.255 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE

02:33:50.121 --> 02:33:52.690 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITY

02:33:51.255 --> 02:33:54.859 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE ALSO NEED TO FOCUS

02:33:52.690 --> 02:33:56.160 region:rollup2
ON RESILIENCE AND SO MANY OF THE

02:33:54.859 --> 02:33:57.528 region:rollup2
PANELISTS WHO COME BEFORE ME

02:33:56.160 --> 02:33:59.097 region:rollup2
HAVE TALKED ABOUT. THE ASUS

02:33:57.528 --> 02:34:00.598 region:rollup2
SERVIAN HOW IT HAS THESE TEN

02:33:59.097 --> 02:34:02.133 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ON IT THAT MEASURE

02:34:00.598 --> 02:34:03.901 region:rollup2
ABUSE NEGLECT AND HOUSEHOLD

02:34:02.133 --> 02:34:04.802 region:rollup2
DYSFUNCTION BUT WHAT WE HAVEN'T

02:34:03.901 --> 02:34:06.437 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT IS THERE'S ALSO A A

02:34:04.802 --> 02:34:07.505 region:rollup2
RESILIENT SURVEY THAT TALKS

02:34:06.437 --> 02:34:09.207 region:rollup2
ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS SOME OF

02:34:07.505 --> 02:34:10.441 region:rollup2
THE REASONS WHY WE DO THESE

02:34:09.207 --> 02:34:11.743 region:rollup2
TRAINING. THERE'S ALWAYS

02:34:10.441 --> 02:34:13.144 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY WHO INEVITABLY COMES UP

02:34:11.743 --> 02:34:14.312 region:rollup2
TO YOU AFTER THAT THAT I WAS

02:34:13.144 --> 02:34:15.713 region:rollup2
REALLY WORRIED WHEN YOU TALKED

02:34:14.312 --> 02:34:16.481 region:rollup2
ABOUT ALL YOU KNOW THAT PEOPLE

02:34:15.713 --> 02:34:18.349 region:rollup2
WHO HAVE.

02:34:16.481 --> 02:34:19.417 region:rollup2
ACES ARE A THOUSAND TIMES MORE

02:34:18.349 --> 02:34:20.651 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO PASS THEM ON TO THEIR

02:34:19.417 --> 02:34:21.853 region:rollup2
CHILDREN AND THAT YOU KNOW THEY

02:34:20.651 --> 02:34:23.387 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S THIS INCREASE IN

02:34:21.853 --> 02:34:24.822 region:rollup2
HEART DISEASE AND DIABETES AND

02:34:23.387 --> 02:34:26.357 region:rollup2
SMOKING AND ALL THESE THINGS.

02:34:24.822 --> 02:34:27.992 region:rollup2
AND THEN I REALIZED THAT MY

02:34:26.357 --> 02:34:29.627 region:rollup2
RESILIENT SCORE WAS FOURTEEN AT

02:34:27.992 --> 02:34:30.995 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE

02:34:29.627 --> 02:34:32.363 region:rollup2
TODAY AND HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED

02:34:30.995 --> 02:34:33.131 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT'S WHY I

02:34:32.363 --> 02:34:35.466 region:rollup2
MADE MY BRAIN HAD SOME

02:34:33.131 --> 02:34:36.767 region:rollup2
PLASTICITY AND WAS ABLE TO DO SO

02:34:35.466 --> 02:34:38.236 region:rollup2
MADERA PRUNING IN THE RIGHT WAY

02:34:36.767 --> 02:34:40.404 region:rollup2
FOR THE GRAIN RIGHT MATTER. TO

02:34:38.236 --> 02:34:41.906 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO ALLOW ME TO COPE WITH

02:34:40.404 --> 02:34:44.142 region:rollup2
TO ADAPT I HAD PEOPLE IN MY LIFE

02:34:41.906 --> 02:34:45.943 region:rollup2
WHO BELIEVED IN ME MY COMMUNITY

02:34:44.142 --> 02:34:47.779 region:rollup2
HAD GOAL THERE ALL OF THE THINGS

02:34:45.943 --> 02:34:49.847 region:rollup2
THAT WERE HAPPENING THAT WERE

02:34:47.779 --> 02:34:51.149 region:rollup2
RESILIENT. IF WE NEED TO THINK

02:34:49.847 --> 02:34:52.817 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW DO WE THEN EXPAND

02:34:51.149 --> 02:34:55.219 region:rollup2
THOSE FROM INDIVIDUAL RESILIENCE

02:34:52.817 --> 02:34:58.156 region:rollup2
FACTORS TO BEING COMMUNITY

02:34:55.219 --> 02:34:59.891 region:rollup2
RESILIENCE FACTORS AND SO WE ARE

02:34:58.156 --> 02:35:02.660 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS LIKE THE ADVANCE PEACE

02:34:59.891 --> 02:35:03.094 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WHICH OF THE DRESSING

02:35:02.660 --> 02:35:03.761 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY VIOLENCE.

02:35:03.094 --> 02:35:04.395 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE

02:35:03.761 --> 02:35:05.062 region:rollup2
EXPAND THOSE WE HAVE ECONOMIC

02:35:04.395 --> 02:35:05.563 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS SO IF WE'RE

02:35:05.062 --> 02:35:06.030 region:rollup2
THINKING ABOUT YOU KNOW

02:35:05.563 --> 02:35:06.564 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE

02:35:06.030 --> 02:35:07.131 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS

02:35:06.564 --> 02:35:08.499 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT THAT ARE

02:35:07.131 --> 02:35:09.834 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING HIGH LEVELS. OF

02:35:08.499 --> 02:35:11.469 region:rollup2
UNEMPLOYMENT WE NEED TO GO HOW

02:35:09.834 --> 02:35:12.904 region:rollup2
DO THEY DO WE ADDRESS THOSE AND

02:35:11.469 --> 02:35:14.305 region:rollup2
NOT THINK ABOUT IT JUST FROM THE

02:35:12.904 --> 02:35:16.374 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE OF YOU KNOW THE

02:35:14.305 --> 02:35:17.742 region:rollup2
TYPICAL OUTCOMES BUT HOW THEN

02:35:16.374 --> 02:35:19.310 region:rollup2
DOES THAT ALSO AFFECT THE

02:35:17.742 --> 02:35:20.478 region:rollup2
RESILIENCE WHEN THERE IS A

02:35:19.310 --> 02:35:21.712 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY TRAUMA. WE NEED TO

02:35:20.478 --> 02:35:23.281 region:rollup2
THINK BY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS

02:35:21.712 --> 02:35:24.816 region:rollup2
IN THE SAME WAY AND HOW THAT

02:35:23.281 --> 02:35:26.417 region:rollup2
ALLOWS COMMUNITIES TO CONNECT IT

02:35:24.816 --> 02:35:28.119 region:rollup2
TO BE MOBILE AND THEN HOW THAT

02:35:26.417 --> 02:35:29.387 region:rollup2
ALSO ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE TO

02:35:28.119 --> 02:35:31.322 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT CONNECTION WITHIN THE

02:35:29.387 --> 02:35:32.623 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY. AND MAKING SURE THE

02:35:31.322 --> 02:35:34.258 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES ARE ENGAGED IN

02:35:32.623 --> 02:35:35.893 region:rollup2
PRIORITY SETTING ONE OF THE

02:35:34.258 --> 02:35:36.961 region:rollup2
THINGS ABOUT INTO RESTORING

02:35:35.893 --> 02:35:38.329 region:rollup2
SAFETY IS THAT MANY TIMES THE

02:35:36.961 --> 02:35:39.730 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN TRAUMATIZED

02:35:38.329 --> 02:35:41.232 region:rollup2
THEY FEEL LIKE THE TROUBLE WITH

02:35:39.730 --> 02:35:42.300 region:rollup2
OUT OF THEIR CONTROL. AND SO

02:35:41.232 --> 02:35:43.801 region:rollup2
WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE WHEN THE

02:35:42.300 --> 02:35:45.236 region:rollup2
COMPANIES COMMUNITY TRAUMA THEM

02:35:43.801 --> 02:35:46.337 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALSO OUT OF THEIR CONTROL

02:35:45.236 --> 02:35:47.872 region:rollup2
THERE'S THE SENSE OF

02:35:46.337 --> 02:35:49.540 region:rollup2
HOPELESSNESS THAT BACK NAM TAKES

02:35:47.872 --> 02:35:51.042 region:rollup2
HOLD AND SO REALLY MAKING SURE

02:35:49.540 --> 02:35:52.510 region:rollup2
THAT EVEN IN THE WAY IN WHICH WE

02:35:51.042 --> 02:35:54.078 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN SETTING POLICY

02:35:52.510 --> 02:35:56.013 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES. IS COMMUNITY BASED

02:35:54.078 --> 02:35:56.781 region:rollup2
IN IS INCLUDING PEOPLE SO THAT

02:35:56.013 --> 02:35:58.282 region:rollup2
WERE NOT TRAUMATIZING THEM IN

02:35:56.781 --> 02:35:59.650 region:rollup2
THAT WAY AND THEN OF COURSE

02:35:58.282 --> 02:36:02.019 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT OUR SAFETY

02:35:59.650 --> 02:36:02.353 region:rollup2
POLICY THERE AGAIN NOT

02:36:02.019 --> 02:36:03.588 region:rollup2
DRAMATIZING.

02:36:02.353 --> 02:36:03.788 region:rollup2
AND SO IF YOU THINK ABOUT THAT

02:36:03.588 --> 02:36:05.489 region:rollup2
WHEN.

02:36:03.788 --> 02:36:06.591 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I'D SHOW THEM EXAMPLES

02:36:05.489 --> 02:36:08.426 region:rollup2
HERE OF SOME OF THE COMMUNITY

02:36:06.591 --> 02:36:09.861 region:rollup2
TRAUMAS OF HAVING INTERIOR

02:36:08.426 --> 02:36:11.395 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT FOR AYE EASE OF A

02:36:09.861 --> 02:36:12.830 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW SCHOOL SHOOTINGS ONE OF

02:36:11.395 --> 02:36:14.432 region:rollup2
THE GOOD ONE EXAMPLE THE BAT IS.

02:36:12.830 --> 02:36:16.367 region:rollup2
A SAFETY PROTOCOL FOR THE SCHOOL

02:36:14.432 --> 02:36:17.435 region:rollup2
SHOOTINGS IS TO DO THESE DRILLS

02:36:16.367 --> 02:36:19.136 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVEN'T THOUGHT ABOUT

02:36:17.435 --> 02:36:21.606 region:rollup2
HOW DOING SAFETY DRILLS FOR

02:36:19.136 --> 02:36:22.607 region:rollup2
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS DRAMATIZES MANY

02:36:21.606 --> 02:36:23.207 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

02:36:22.607 --> 02:36:24.809 region:rollup2
AND SO WE REALLY NEED TO THINK

02:36:23.207 --> 02:36:26.611 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN TERMS

02:36:24.809 --> 02:36:28.980 region:rollup2
OF HOW DO WE BALANCE THE NEED

02:36:26.611 --> 02:36:30.114 region:rollup2
FOR PREPARATION WITH ALSO THE

02:36:28.980 --> 02:36:31.549 region:rollup2
NEED FOR SAFETY.

02:37:34.945 --> 02:37:38.249 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HE HAD NO PLACE TO GO.

02:37:36.681 --> 02:37:39.216 region:rollup2

02:38:01.639 --> 02:38:03.407 region:rollup2
PROBABLY BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO

OFFER HIM MONEY IF YOU DON'T

BUT CALIFORNIANS RECEIVED

02:38:23.194 --> 02:38:26.030 region:rollup2
INJUSTICE IS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:38:24.795 --> 02:38:27.798 region:rollup2
REFORM ORGANIZATION THAT'S

02:38:26.030 --> 02:38:29.767 region:rollup2

STANDARDS FOR TRAUMA RECOVERY

02:38:51.722 --> 02:38:54.358 region:rollup2
CENTERS.

02:38:52.790 --> 02:38:55.626 region:rollup2
WE WORKED WITH THE CHAIR HERE

02:38:54.358 --> 02:38:57.094 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR ON AB THREE FORTY

02:38:55.626 --> 02:38:57.862 region:rollup2
WHICH I'M WILL INCREASE

02:38:57.094 --> 02:38:59.463 region:rollup2
SCREENINGS FOR KIDS WHO

02:38:57.862 --> 02:39:01.065 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCED TRAUMA AND MEDICAL

02:38:59.463 --> 02:39:03.067 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS. TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL

02:39:01.065 --> 02:39:05.603 region:rollup2
KIDS HAVE ACCESS TO EARLY.

02:39:03.067 --> 02:39:07.505 region:rollup2
IDENTIFICATION OF TRAUMA.

02:39:05.603 --> 02:39:09.673 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THAT

02:39:07.505 --> 02:39:10.941 region:rollup2
PIPELINE BACK FROM THE PRISON TO

02:39:09.673 --> 02:39:12.643 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHY DO WE HAVE SO

02:39:10.941 --> 02:39:14.678 region:rollup2
MANY FOSTER INVOLVED YOUTH WIDE

02:39:12.643 --> 02:39:15.913 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SO MANY CHILDREN FROM

02:39:14.678 --> 02:39:17.381 region:rollup2
MINORITY LOW INCOME.

02:39:15.913 --> 02:39:19.183 region:rollup2
YOU NO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

02:39:17.381 --> 02:39:20.584 region:rollup2
IN PRISON WHY ARE SO MANY WOMEN

02:39:19.183 --> 02:39:22.853 region:rollup2
WHO ARE IN PRISON IN CALIFORNIA

02:39:20.584 --> 02:39:24.188 region:rollup2
THESE DAYS VICTIMS OF SEXUAL AND

02:39:22.853 --> 02:39:25.823 region:rollup2
VIOLENT ABUSE IN THEIR CHILDHOOD

02:39:24.188 --> 02:39:27.124 region:rollup2
AND ADOLESCENCE.

02:39:25.823 --> 02:39:29.360 region:rollup2
AND THE REALITIES THAT.

02:39:27.124 --> 02:39:30.761 region:rollup2
A LOT OF THE THINGS WE FOUND

02:39:29.360 --> 02:39:32.063 region:rollup2
CAN BE DEALT WITH IN A PLACE

02:39:30.761 --> 02:39:33.330 region:rollup2
THAT WOULDN'T THINK WE'D FIND IT

02:39:32.063 --> 02:39:34.899 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE SCHOOL.

02:39:33.330 --> 02:39:36.167 region:rollup2
AND SO OUR INTEREST IN THIS

02:39:34.899 --> 02:39:37.735 region:rollup2
HEARING WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THE

02:39:36.167 --> 02:39:38.836 region:rollup2
CHAIRS FOR CONVENING IT IS THAT

02:39:37.735 --> 02:39:40.538 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY THINK THE SCHOOL

02:39:38.836 --> 02:39:41.972 region:rollup2
PROVIDES ONE OF THE NEXT STEPS

02:39:40.538 --> 02:39:43.808 region:rollup2
BEYOND FROM RECOVERY CENTERS FOR

02:39:41.972 --> 02:39:44.842 region:rollup2
ADULTS AND. HEALTH SCREENINGS

02:39:43.808 --> 02:39:46.477 region:rollup2
FOR KIDS THAT THE SCHOOLS

02:39:44.842 --> 02:39:48.045 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY A TOTALLY ADEQUATE

02:39:46.477 --> 02:39:49.880 region:rollup2
PLACE AN APPROPRIATE PLACE.

02:39:48.045 --> 02:39:50.481 region:rollup2
A PLACE WHERE CHILDREN SPEND

02:39:49.880 --> 02:39:51.515 region:rollup2
MOST OF THEIR DAY WHEN THEY'RE

02:39:50.481 --> 02:39:53.417 region:rollup2
NOT AT HOME.

02:39:51.515 --> 02:39:55.486 region:rollup2
TO ACTUALLY SCREEN IDENTIFYING

02:39:53.417 --> 02:39:56.987 region:rollup2
TREAT CHILDREN FOR TRAUMAS.

02:39:55.486 --> 02:39:58.522 region:rollup2
A LARGE NUMBER OF TRAUMA

02:39:56.987 --> 02:40:00.558 region:rollup2
SURVIVORS AS I MENTIONED ARE ALL

02:39:58.522 --> 02:40:01.225 region:rollup2
JUSTICE INVOLVED IN AS WE LIKE

02:40:00.558 --> 02:40:03.627 region:rollup2
TO SAY I'M HURT PEOPLE.

02:40:01.225 --> 02:40:05.596 region:rollup2
HURT PEOPLE.

02:40:03.627 --> 02:40:08.065 region:rollup2
AND SO IF WE ARE GOING TO LOOK

02:40:05.596 --> 02:40:09.600 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY AT HOW WE TREAT TRAUMA

02:40:08.065 --> 02:40:10.868 region:rollup2
IN KIDS.

02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:12.770 region:rollup2
IT WITH WE ARE REALLY SERIOUS

02:40:10.868 --> 02:40:14.271 region:rollup2
ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY

02:40:12.770 --> 02:40:14.939 region:rollup2
AND I APPRECIATE THE SAFETY

02:40:14.271 --> 02:40:16.273 region:rollup2
NARRATIVE BEING KICKED OFF AHEAD

02:40:14.939 --> 02:40:18.075 region:rollup2
OF ME. OUT IF WE IF WE REALLY

02:40:16.273 --> 02:40:19.410 region:rollup2
ARE SERIOUS ABOUT SAFETY WE HAVE

02:40:18.075 --> 02:40:20.911 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT THE CYCLE OF VIOLENCE

02:40:19.410 --> 02:40:22.613 region:rollup2
AND REALIZE IT'S.

02:40:20.911 --> 02:40:24.949 region:rollup2
IT'S ACTUALLY BUILT OFF OF THOSE

02:40:22.613 --> 02:40:26.951 region:rollup2
NEUROLOGICAL MECHANISMS DOCTOR.

02:40:24.949 --> 02:40:28.586 region:rollup2
NADINE SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER

02:40:26.951 --> 02:40:30.020 region:rollup2
RELATED TO THAT FIGHT OR FLIGHT

02:40:28.586 --> 02:40:31.455 region:rollup2
INSTINCT.

02:40:30.020 --> 02:40:32.923 region:rollup2
ITS OF IMPLICATIONS TODAY ARE

02:40:31.455 --> 02:40:34.391 region:rollup2
SERIOUS A CHILD WHO IS A VICTIM

02:40:32.923 --> 02:40:36.160 region:rollup2
OF TRAUMA.

02:40:34.391 --> 02:40:38.229 region:rollup2
THE GOES UNDETECTED IN UNTREATED

02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:39.497 region:rollup2
IS LABELED TRUANT TODAY THEIR

02:40:38.229 --> 02:40:41.232 region:rollup2
LABEL ANTISOCIAL MAXED.

02:40:39.497 --> 02:40:42.333 region:rollup2
THEN THERE ARE DELINQUENT

02:40:41.232 --> 02:40:43.701 region:rollup2
THEN THE SCHOOL DECIDES THAT

02:40:42.333 --> 02:40:44.869 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD BE.

02:40:43.701 --> 02:40:46.303 region:rollup2
DISCIPLINED AND WITHHELD FROM

02:40:44.869 --> 02:40:48.472 region:rollup2
RECESS

02:40:46.303 --> 02:40:49.907 region:rollup2
THAT BECOMES A SUSPENSION.

02:40:48.472 --> 02:40:51.375 region:rollup2
THEN THAT'S AN EXPULSION WHEN

02:40:49.907 --> 02:40:52.510 region:rollup2
THEY TURN EIGHTEEN WE SEE

02:40:51.375 --> 02:40:55.246 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THINGS WE CALL THEM A

02:40:52.510 --> 02:40:57.581 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL WE CALL THEM A FELON.

02:40:55.246 --> 02:40:58.649 region:rollup2
WE CALL THEM A RECIDIVIST.

02:40:57.581 --> 02:41:00.618 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA THERE FORTY EIGHT

02:40:58.649 --> 02:41:02.786 region:rollup2
THOUSAND.

02:41:00.618 --> 02:41:03.854 region:rollup2
CIVIL STATUTE PENALTIES THAT

02:41:02.786 --> 02:41:05.723 region:rollup2
PROHIBIT A PERSON WITH A

02:41:03.854 --> 02:41:07.458 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL RECORD FROM ENGAGING IN

02:41:05.723 --> 02:41:08.726 region:rollup2
NORMAL DAILY ACTIVITY.

02:41:07.458 --> 02:41:09.493 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T BECOME A BARBER IN

02:41:08.726 --> 02:41:10.961 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IF YOU HAVE A

02:41:09.493 --> 02:41:13.030 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL RECORD YOU CAN'T BECOME

02:41:10.961 --> 02:41:14.031 region:rollup2
A COSMETOLOGIST.

02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:15.232 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T BE A NURSE YOU CAN'T

02:41:14.031 --> 02:41:17.134 region:rollup2
CARE FOR IT AS A BEEN ADOPTED

02:41:15.232 --> 02:41:18.269 region:rollup2
PARENT FOR ONE OF YOUR. YOUR

02:41:17.134 --> 02:41:19.303 region:rollup2
YOUR NIECES OR NEPHEWS IF THE

02:41:18.269 --> 02:41:20.905 region:rollup2
PARENTAL.

02:41:19.303 --> 02:41:23.140 region:rollup2
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD DIES OR IS

02:41:20.905 --> 02:41:25.376 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE INCARCERATED WE HAVE

02:41:23.140 --> 02:41:26.610 region:rollup2
CREATED A SYSTEM WHERE HURT

02:41:25.376 --> 02:41:28.579 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WILL HURT PEOPLE.

02:41:26.610 --> 02:41:29.914 region:rollup2
AND SO WE BELIEVE THAT THERE

02:41:28.579 --> 02:41:31.248 region:rollup2
ARE A NUMBER OF VERY GOOD

02:41:29.914 --> 02:41:32.950 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERVENTION

02:41:31.248 --> 02:41:34.418 region:rollup2
AND WE'D BE VERY HAPPY TO SPEAK

02:41:32.950 --> 02:41:34.852 region:rollup2
WITH MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE

02:41:34.418 --> 02:41:36.654 region:rollup2
FURTHER ABOUT THOSE

02:41:34.852 --> 02:41:37.955 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES. A LOT OF THEM

02:41:36.654 --> 02:41:39.190 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN SAID ALREADY.

02:41:37.955 --> 02:41:41.225 region:rollup2
BUT ONE OF THE ONES THAT WE

02:41:39.190 --> 02:41:42.126 region:rollup2
WANT TO SEE HAPPEN IS WE WANT TO

02:41:41.225 --> 02:41:43.894 region:rollup2
BREAK THE INTERGENERATIONAL

02:41:42.126 --> 02:41:46.463 region:rollup2
NATURE OF.

02:41:43.894 --> 02:41:48.032 region:rollup2
TRAUMA AMONG CHILDREN IN THE

02:41:46.463 --> 02:41:49.300 region:rollup2
BEST WAY TO DO THAT IS EARLY I

02:41:48.032 --> 02:41:50.401 region:rollup2
MEAN DOCTOR ETIENNE'S FIRST

02:41:49.300 --> 02:41:52.202 region:rollup2
SLIDE WAS THE BEST SLIDE OF THE

02:41:50.401 --> 02:41:53.637 region:rollup2
DAY. YOU KNOW A THREE YEAR OLD

02:41:52.202 --> 02:41:55.272 region:rollup2
CHILD WHOSE GROWTH TRAJECTORY IS

02:41:53.637 --> 02:41:56.273 region:rollup2
ALTERED.

02:41:55.272 --> 02:41:57.775 region:rollup2
BY HAVING ACES AT THE AGE OF

02:41:56.273 --> 02:41:59.176 region:rollup2
THREE. AND SO HOW DO WE DO THAT

02:41:57.775 --> 02:42:00.911 region:rollup2
IN THE SCHOOLS WILL BE FOR A LOT

02:41:59.176 --> 02:42:02.713 region:rollup2
OF GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT.

02:42:00.911 --> 02:42:04.248 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW THE STATE IS SILO

02:42:02.713 --> 02:42:05.082 region:rollup2
DIDN'T STRUCTURE THAT'S VERY

02:42:04.248 --> 02:42:06.817 region:rollup2
TRUE AND NOT YOU KNOW MEMBER

02:42:05.082 --> 02:42:07.751 region:rollup2
MATHIS WAS SPEAKING EARLIER

02:42:06.817 --> 02:42:09.153 region:rollup2
ABOUT HAVING TO.

02:42:07.751 --> 02:42:09.753 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING WORK WITH A WHOLE

02:42:09.153 --> 02:42:10.888 region:rollup2
TON OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND I

02:42:09.753 --> 02:42:12.156 region:rollup2
THINK.

02:42:10.888 --> 02:42:13.424 region:rollup2
ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT YOU

02:42:12.156 --> 02:42:14.358 region:rollup2
KNOW THE TRUMP RECOVERY CENTER

02:42:13.424 --> 02:42:16.126 region:rollup2
MODELED DOES.

02:42:14.358 --> 02:42:17.261 region:rollup2
THERE'S A POINT PERSON EVERY

02:42:16.126 --> 02:42:19.096 region:rollup2
TIME YOU COMMAND IF YOU'RE CRIME

02:42:17.261 --> 02:42:20.097 region:rollup2
SURVIVOR EVERYTIME YOU COME IN

02:42:19.096 --> 02:42:21.999 region:rollup2
THE SAME PERSON.

02:42:20.097 --> 02:42:22.499 region:rollup2
WHO WHO MET YOU THE FIRST DAYS

02:42:21.999 --> 02:42:23.634 region:rollup2
THE PERSON WHO MEETS YOU

02:42:22.499 --> 02:42:25.269 region:rollup2
EVERYTIME YOU COMMAND YOU TO

02:42:23.634 --> 02:42:26.704 region:rollup2
COMPLEMENT OF STAFF TO ASSIST

02:42:25.269 --> 02:42:27.938 region:rollup2
YOU WITH YOUR NEEDS AS YOU GO

02:42:26.704 --> 02:42:30.507 region:rollup2
THROUGH? COUNSELING OR THERAPY

02:42:27.938 --> 02:42:32.610 region:rollup2
ON BUT YOU HAVE A SINGLE SOURCE.

02:42:30.507 --> 02:42:33.911 region:rollup2
FOR CONTACT TO YOUR WHOLE PERSON

02:42:32.610 --> 02:42:35.479 region:rollup2
CARE.

02:42:33.911 --> 02:42:38.015 region:rollup2
AND IN THE SCHOOL SETTING THE

02:42:35.479 --> 02:42:38.916 region:rollup2
SCHOOL REALLY ACTUALLY SERVES

HAPPEN IN THE COMMUNITIES.

02:43:16.420 --> 02:43:19.857 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WHEN ONE CHILD HURTS

ELSEWHERE IN THE COMMUNITY AND

02:43:29.633 --> 02:43:32.936 region:rollup2
BRING THEM TO SCHOOL WE CAN

02:43:31.001 --> 02:43:34.571 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE TEACHERS WHO

EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IT

02:43:48.852 --> 02:43:52.389 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASES THE

LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL BE. A

AND SO.

02:43:56.393 --> 02:43:58.996 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA CUT LEAVE IT AT THAT

02:43:57.795 --> 02:44:00.297 region:rollup2
AT A HIGH LEVEL I COULD GO INTO

02:43:58.996 --> 02:44:01.699 region:rollup2
ALL THE DETAILS OF HOW THE MODEL

02:44:00.297 --> 02:44:03.467 region:rollup2
WORKS IN AND WHERE THE SUPPORTS

02:44:01.699 --> 02:44:05.202 region:rollup2
ARE AT A BASE A LARGE MAJORITY

02:44:03.467 --> 02:44:06.837 region:rollup2
OF THE TIME SPENT ON BUILDING.

02:44:05.202 --> 02:44:08.105 region:rollup2

02:44:08.105 --> 02:44:11.475 region:rollup2
STUDENTS AT A HIGHER LEVEL YOU

02:44:10.274 --> 02:44:12.876 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY GET DOWN TO THE HANDFUL

02:44:11.475 --> 02:44:14.745 region:rollup2
OF STUDENTS WHO REALLY NEED

02:44:12.876 --> 02:44:16.480 region:rollup2
INTENSIVE. TRAUMA INFORMED

02:44:14.745 --> 02:44:18.048 region:rollup2
THERAPIES ON THINGS THAT ARE

02:44:16.480 --> 02:44:20.017 region:rollup2
AKIN TO IEP KIND OF KIND OF

02:44:18.048 --> 02:44:21.318 region:rollup2
STUFF ON AND AND THAT THE MODEL

02:44:20.017 --> 02:44:23.087 region:rollup2
REALLY ACCOMMODATES ALL THOSE

02:44:21.318 --> 02:44:25.289 region:rollup2
THINGS BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY

02:44:23.087 --> 02:44:26.990 region:rollup2
SERVE KIDS INDIVIDUALLY. WITH

02:44:25.289 --> 02:44:28.025 region:rollup2
COUNSELING ONE ON ONE AND SEND

02:44:26.990 --> 02:44:29.493 region:rollup2
THEM TO SCHOOL WHERE THE

02:44:28.025 --> 02:44:30.461 region:rollup2
TEACHERS THESE AND SHOWING UP

02:44:29.493 --> 02:44:31.895 region:rollup2
LATE AND JUST THINGS BELIEVES

02:44:30.461 --> 02:44:33.697 region:rollup2
ABSENT A BILL IS TRUANT. OR

02:44:31.895 --> 02:44:35.332 region:rollup2
BELIEVES IS ACTING OUT IN CLASS

02:44:33.697 --> 02:44:36.166 region:rollup2
WHEN THE TRUTH IS BILLY DIDN'T

02:44:35.332 --> 02:44:38.168 region:rollup2
WANT TO COME TO SCHOOL TODAY

02:44:36.166 --> 02:44:39.269 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HIS MOM HAD A NEGATIVE

02:44:38.168 --> 02:44:40.504 region:rollup2
INTERACTION WITH A NEIGHBOR WHO

02:44:39.269 --> 02:44:42.206 region:rollup2
THREATENED TO CALL THE POLICE

02:44:40.504 --> 02:44:43.307 region:rollup2
AND HAVE REMOVED BY ICE. AND

02:44:42.206 --> 02:44:45.275 region:rollup2
HE'S AFRAID TO GO TO SCHOOL

02:44:43.307 --> 02:44:46.243 region:rollup2
BECAUSE HE'S AFRAID HE'LL COME

HOME HIS MOM WON'T BE THERE.

02:44:46.243 --> 02:44:48.212 region:rollup2
AND SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF

02:44:46.844 --> 02:44:49.747 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT TEACHERS.

02:44:48.212 --> 02:44:51.548 region:rollup2

THINGS AND TEACHERS HAVE THEIR

02:44:56.220 --> 02:44:58.789 region:rollup2
SECOND HAND RIGHT TEACHERS.

02:44:57.921 --> 02:45:01.024 region:rollup2
TEACHERS EXPRESS THAT ALL THE

02:44:58.789 --> 02:45:02.392 region:rollup2
TIME AND AND WE REALLY CAN

02:45:01.024 --> 02:45:04.461 region:rollup2
CREATE GREATER COMMUNITY

02:45:02.392 --> 02:45:06.697 region:rollup2

BELIEVE THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE THE

02:45:09.266 --> 02:45:13.637 region:rollup2
EXISTING. SCHOOL SYSTEM AND THE

02:45:11.368 --> 02:45:15.939 region:rollup2

SOME DON'T SOME WHEAT SOME OF

02:48:01.004 --> 02:48:03.974 region:rollup2
THE FIRST SYSTEM THAT THEY'VE

02:48:01.939 --> 02:48:05.676 region:rollup2
BEEN. IN CONTACT WITH BUT ONCE

02:48:03.974 --> 02:48:07.678 region:rollup2
THEY COME INTO OUR SYSTEM WE

02:48:05.676 --> 02:48:09.079 region:rollup2
BROKER SERVICES THE CHILD

02:48:07.678 --> 02:48:10.614 region:rollup2
WELFARE SERVICES SYSTEM DOESN'T

02:48:09.079 --> 02:48:12.649 region:rollup2
DELIVER HEALTH OR BEHAVIORAL

02:48:10.614 --> 02:48:13.951 region:rollup2
HEALTH SERVICES WE WORK WITH

02:48:12.649 --> 02:48:14.885 region:rollup2
PARTNER AGENCIES PUBLIC AND

02:48:13.951 --> 02:48:16.453 region:rollup2
NONPROFIT TO DELIVER THE

02:48:14.885 --> 02:48:18.455 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

02:48:16.453 --> 02:48:19.690 region:rollup2
SO FROM WE HAVE IT WE HAVE IT AT

02:48:18.455 --> 02:48:21.458 region:rollup2
A GOOD VANTAGE POINT I THINK

02:48:19.690 --> 02:48:23.193 region:rollup2
ARM TO COME TO THE FOLLOWING

02:48:21.458 --> 02:48:26.229 region:rollup2
CONCLUSION AND THAT'S DESPITE

02:48:23.193 --> 02:48:28.098 region:rollup2
TWO DECADES OF RESEARCH.

02:48:26.229 --> 02:48:29.933 region:rollup2
THAT INDICATES.

02:48:28.098 --> 02:48:31.835 region:rollup2
REALLY WHAT PUBLIC AND AND OTHER

02:48:29.933 --> 02:48:33.937 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS OUGHT TO BE DOING

02:48:31.835 --> 02:48:35.572 region:rollup2
THERE'S A HUGE GAP BETWEEN WHAT

02:48:33.937 --> 02:48:36.707 region:rollup2
THE RESEARCH ON ASUS SUGGEST

02:48:35.572 --> 02:48:38.875 region:rollup2
THAT OUR SYSTEM SHOULD BE DOING

02:48:36.707 --> 02:48:40.877 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING.

02:48:38.875 --> 02:48:41.378 region:rollup2
AND TO BE ABLE TO FOCUS ON THAT

02:48:40.877 --> 02:48:43.380 region:rollup2
TO HAPPEN.

02:48:41.378 --> 02:48:44.614 region:rollup2
OFFER SOME SOLUTIONS IS IS A

02:48:43.380 --> 02:48:45.048 region:rollup2
PRIVILEGE THAT I'M THAT I'M

02:48:44.614 --> 02:48:47.050 region:rollup2
QUITE THANKFUL FOR.

02:48:45.048 --> 02:48:48.585 region:rollup2
AT.

02:48:47.050 --> 02:48:49.386 region:rollup2
BOTTOM LINE I THINK WE NEED AND

02:48:48.585 --> 02:48:51.688 region:rollup2
INTENTIONALLY COORDINATED

02:48:49.386 --> 02:48:53.156 region:rollup2
STRATEGY.

02:48:51.688 --> 02:48:54.191 region:rollup2
TO CREATE A TROM INFORM SYSTEM

02:48:53.156 --> 02:48:55.959 region:rollup2
WHERE EVERY TOUCH POINT IN A

02:48:54.191 --> 02:48:57.995 region:rollup2
CHILD'S LIFE

02:48:55.959 --> 02:49:00.297 region:rollup2
LOOKS AT AT A CHILD THE A LENS

02:48:57.995 --> 02:49:02.165 region:rollup2
THAT'S TRAUMA INFORMED.

02:49:00.297 --> 02:49:03.200 region:rollup2
BREAKING DOWN SILOS SHARING

02:49:02.165 --> 02:49:03.700 region:rollup2
INFORMATION IT'S ALL REALLY

02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:05.502 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

02:49:03.700 --> 02:49:07.471 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:49:05.502 --> 02:49:08.405 region:rollup2
BEAT BETWEEN NOW AND THEN WE

02:49:07.471 --> 02:49:11.508 region:rollup2
NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY

02:49:08.405 --> 02:49:13.410 region:rollup2
SINGLE SYSTEM IS INFORMED ABOUT

02:49:11.508 --> 02:49:15.278 region:rollup2
ASUS INFORMED ABOUT TRAUMA. AND

02:49:13.410 --> 02:49:16.213 region:rollup2
LOOKS AT CHILDREN AND IN THE

02:49:15.278 --> 02:49:17.814 region:rollup2
FAMILY ENVIRONMENT FROM THAT

02:49:16.213 --> 02:49:20.017 region:rollup2
CONTEXT.

02:49:17.814 --> 02:49:21.318 region:rollup2
IN THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES

02:49:20.017 --> 02:49:23.353 region:rollup2
SYSTEM BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT

02:49:21.318 --> 02:49:25.122 region:rollup2
THAT WE SERVE ABUSED AND

02:49:23.353 --> 02:49:26.323 region:rollup2
NEGLECTED KIDS WE HAVE.

02:49:25.122 --> 02:49:27.657 region:rollup2
BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT WE HAVE

02:49:26.323 --> 02:49:30.260 region:rollup2
BEEN IMPLEMENTING TROM INFORMED

02:49:27.657 --> 02:49:31.762 region:rollup2
PRACTICES FOR FOR MANY YEARS.

02:49:30.260 --> 02:49:33.096 region:rollup2
ARM AND YET THERE ARE STILL

02:49:31.762 --> 02:49:34.264 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN OUR SYSTEM

02:49:33.096 --> 02:49:35.332 region:rollup2
AND I WANNA I WANNA TALK ABOUT

02:49:34.264 --> 02:49:36.733 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE MAJOR GAPS THAT

02:49:35.332 --> 02:49:38.035 region:rollup2
WE'VE WITNESSED.

02:49:36.733 --> 02:49:39.803 region:rollup2
IN THE CHILD WELFARE SERVICES

02:49:38.035 --> 02:49:41.071 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WE KNOW THAT NINETY

02:49:39.803 --> 02:49:42.639 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE PARENTS IN OUR

02:49:41.071 --> 02:49:44.541 region:rollup2
SYSTEM THEMSELVES EXPERIENCED

02:49:42.639 --> 02:49:46.543 region:rollup2
TRAUMA MANY ABUSED AND NEGLECTED

02:49:44.541 --> 02:49:48.278 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES MANY OTHER TRAUMATIC

02:49:46.543 --> 02:49:50.280 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCES IN THEIR LIVES.

02:49:48.278 --> 02:49:51.715 region:rollup2
BOB WE KNOW THAT PRINT OR TRAUMA

02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:52.949 region:rollup2
MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO

02:49:51.715 --> 02:49:54.684 region:rollup2
TO PROTECT THEIR CHILDREN AND

02:49:52.949 --> 02:49:56.319 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE CHILDREN TO HEAL.

02:49:54.684 --> 02:49:57.788 region:rollup2
BUT THE FEDERAL AND STATE CHILD

02:49:56.319 --> 02:50:00.891 region:rollup2
WELFARE SYSTEM IS REALLY

02:49:57.788 --> 02:50:02.492 region:rollup2
STRUCTURED IN A WAY. THAT WE

02:50:00.891 --> 02:50:04.094 region:rollup2
HAVE VERY LITTLE FLEXIBILITY TO

02:50:02.492 --> 02:50:06.029 region:rollup2
USE FUNDS ON PREVENTION.

02:50:04.094 --> 02:50:07.998 region:rollup2
SO THE VAST MAJORITY OF FUNDING

02:50:06.029 --> 02:50:10.067 region:rollup2
IN OUR SYSTEM BECOMES AVAILABLE

02:50:07.998 --> 02:50:10.901 region:rollup2
ONCE A CHILD IS REMOVED ONCE

02:50:10.067 --> 02:50:12.669 region:rollup2
THEY'VE ALREADY SUFFERED

02:50:10.901 --> 02:50:13.837 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE A SAYS. AND THAT'S AN

02:50:12.669 --> 02:50:15.839 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT THAT WE HAVE TO WORK

02:50:13.837 --> 02:50:17.441 region:rollup2
ON.

02:50:15.839 --> 02:50:18.975 region:rollup2
IN THE PHYSICAL HEALTH BROWN WE

02:50:17.441 --> 02:50:21.678 region:rollup2
WERE HAPPY TO SUPPORT A BILL

02:50:18.975 --> 02:50:23.313 region:rollup2
THAT CSJ SPONSORED AB THREE

02:50:27.918 --> 02:50:32.889 region:rollup2
WHO ARE WHO ARE ON THAT ACCOUNT?

02:50:30.587 --> 02:50:35.325 region:rollup2
THERE'S A REQUIRED SCREENING

02:50:32.889 --> 02:50:38.061 region:rollup2
BASED ON A PERIODICITY SCHEDULE.

02:50:35.325 --> 02:50:39.429 region:rollup2
AND EVERY TIME OPPOSITION SEES

02:50:38.061 --> 02:50:40.897 region:rollup2
A CHILD AN EP STT PROGRAM

02:50:39.429 --> 02:50:42.399 region:rollup2
THEY'RE REQUIRED TO LOOK FOR

02:50:40.897 --> 02:50:44.901 region:rollup2
CYCLE SOCIAL AND BEHAVIORAL

02:50:42.399 --> 02:50:46.269 region:rollup2

02:50:58.949 --> 02:51:02.185 region:rollup2
AND THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BROWN.

02:51:00.984 --> 02:51:03.854 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT OF KIDS IN THE

02:51:02.185 --> 02:51:05.388 region:rollup2
CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM ACCORDING

02:51:03.854 --> 02:51:07.924 region:rollup2

GETTING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

02:51:13.029 --> 02:51:17.100 region:rollup2
I'M IN CALIFORNIA THAT THE.

02:51:16.500 --> 02:51:20.370 region:rollup2
PROGRAM OF.

02:51:17.100 --> 02:51:21.972 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AN

02:51:20.370 --> 02:51:23.540 region:rollup2
INDEPTH BEHAVIOR HEALTH SERVICES

02:51:21.972 --> 02:51:26.143 region:rollup2
FOR PEOPLE WITH SIGNIFICANT.

02:51:23.540 --> 02:51:27.377 region:rollup2
IMPAIRMENTS IS THE BOMB

02:51:26.143 --> 02:51:28.478 region:rollup2
SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM

02:51:27.377 --> 02:51:30.147 region:rollup2
WE CALL IT AND THERE'S A

02:51:28.478 --> 02:51:31.948 region:rollup2
PENETRATION RATE THAT WE

02:51:30.147 --> 02:51:34.084 region:rollup2
CALCULATE. IN CALIFORNIA THE

02:51:31.948 --> 02:51:35.285 region:rollup2
PENETRATION RATE THE NUMBER OF

02:51:34.084 --> 02:51:37.821 region:rollup2
CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE

02:51:35.285 --> 02:51:39.256 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHO HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH

02:51:37.821 --> 02:51:40.657 region:rollup2
THAT SPECIALITY MENTAL HEALTH

02:51:39.256 --> 02:51:42.392 region:rollup2
SYSTEM IS FORTY TWO POINT ONE

02:51:40.657 --> 02:51:44.261 region:rollup2
PERCENT ITS MOST RECENT DATA.

02:51:42.392 --> 02:51:45.495 region:rollup2
THAT INFORMATION THAT NUMBER

02:51:44.261 --> 02:51:46.997 region:rollup2
INCLUDES KIDS WERE ASSESSED BUT

02:51:45.495 --> 02:51:47.964 region:rollup2
THEN NOT.

02:51:46.997 --> 02:51:49.666 region:rollup2
SORT OF NOT REFER TO ANY OTHER

02:51:47.964 --> 02:51:51.168 region:rollup2
SERVICE.

02:51:49.666 --> 02:51:52.269 region:rollup2
THE STATE CALCULATE SOMETHING

02:51:51.168 --> 02:51:54.304 region:rollup2
CALLED THE ENGAGEMENT RATE THE

02:51:52.269 --> 02:51:55.906 region:rollup2
ENGAGEMENT RATE IS THE NUMBER OF

02:51:54.304 --> 02:51:57.774 region:rollup2
CHILDREN HAVE HAD FIVE CONTACTS

02:51:55.906 --> 02:52:00.177 region:rollup2
IN A YEAR AND THAT'S THIRTY ONE

02:51:57.774 --> 02:52:01.945 region:rollup2
POINT SEVEN PERCENT.

02:52:00.177 --> 02:52:03.446 region:rollup2
SO WHY THIS WHY THIS DISCONNECT

02:52:01.945 --> 02:52:05.949 region:rollup2
BETWEEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT

02:52:03.446 --> 02:52:07.551 region:rollup2
ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES.

02:52:05.949 --> 02:52:11.154 region:rollup2
BOB AND THE DAMAGE IT DOES TO

02:52:07.551 --> 02:52:11.822 region:rollup2
KIDS AND THAT PRECEDED

02:52:11.154 --> 02:52:13.290 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND I

02:52:11.822 --> 02:52:14.291 region:rollup2
AT. I THINK IT'S A REALLY

02:52:13.290 --> 02:52:17.127 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT QUESTION.

02:52:14.291 --> 02:52:18.361 region:rollup2
BUT BECAUSE EP STT AS A FEDERAL

02:52:17.127 --> 02:52:18.895 region:rollup2
ENTITLEMENT AND IF YOU LOOK AT

02:52:18.361 --> 02:52:21.031 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL LAW IT'S QUITE

02:52:18.895 --> 02:52:24.067 region:rollup2
BROAD.

02:52:21.031 --> 02:52:24.568 region:rollup2
IT'S EARLY PERIODIC DIE NOW

02:52:24.067 --> 02:52:26.169 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSTIC SCREENING AND

02:52:24.568 --> 02:52:26.403 region:rollup2

02:52:26.169 --> 02:52:27.938 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

02:52:26.403 --> 02:52:29.239 region:rollup2
.

02:52:27.938 --> 02:52:30.607 region:rollup2
AND IF YOU JUST READ THE FEDERAL

02:52:29.239 --> 02:52:32.275 region:rollup2
LAW YOU WOULD SAY WELL THIS IS

02:52:30.607 --> 02:52:33.910 region:rollup2
THE ANSWER TO ISIS.

02:52:32.275 --> 02:52:36.346 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

02:52:33.910 --> 02:52:37.914 region:rollup2
THE ELIGIBILITY IS BROUGHT TO

02:52:36.346 --> 02:52:39.583 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT CAN BE PROVIDED TO

A PRETTY BROAD.

02:52:39.583 --> 02:52:42.452 region:rollup2
BUT IN IN ACTUALITY THE WAY THE

02:52:40.951 --> 02:52:43.820 region:rollup2
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADMINISTERS

02:52:42.452 --> 02:52:45.155 region:rollup2

02:52:57.601 --> 02:53:01.972 region:rollup2
REALLY. IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY

02:52:59.569 --> 02:53:02.939 region:rollup2
CREATES THE GATE INTO.

02:53:01.972 --> 02:53:04.674 region:rollup2

AND SO.

02:53:05.342 --> 02:53:09.412 region:rollup2
THERE THERE IS IN MY OPINION A

02:53:08.712 --> 02:53:10.947 region:rollup2
DISCONNECT

02:53:09.412 --> 02:53:12.582 region:rollup2
BETWEEN.

02:53:10.947 --> 02:53:13.883 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE BIG.

02:53:12.582 --> 02:53:16.086 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT TO CRITICIZE

02:53:13.883 --> 02:53:16.620 region:rollup2
COUNTIES THIS IS THE NATIONAL

THAT ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM

02:53:39.276 --> 02:53:42.012 region:rollup2
PRACTICALLY IT DOESN'T HAPPEN

E..

02:53:42.012 --> 02:53:46.783 region:rollup2
THAT HAPPENS AFTER.

02:53:44.648 --> 02:53:47.651 region:rollup2
THE ACES WAS THE TRAUMA THAT THE

02:54:02.732 --> 02:54:05.335 region:rollup2
THINK THE NOTION OF AB THREE

02:54:04.234 --> 02:54:06.970 region:rollup2

02:54:05.335 --> 02:54:08.638 region:rollup2
OTHER SYSTEM.

02:54:06.970 --> 02:54:11.841 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD TAKE THE IDEA OF A

MANDATORY TRAUMA SCREEN AND TAKE

02:54:11.841 --> 02:54:13.710 region:rollup2

EXPRESSED.

02:54:33.296 --> 02:54:36.733 region:rollup2
HIS AMBIVALENCE OVER SCREENING

02:54:35.465 --> 02:54:38.134 region:rollup2

02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:14.004 region:rollup2
TRAUMA THAT WE IDENTIFY.

02:55:11.868 --> 02:55:15.739 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO MODERNIZE OUR

WELFARE SYSTEM THE WORST THING

02:55:34.190 --> 02:55:38.461 region:rollup2
THAT CAN HAPPEN TO THEM IS TO BE

02:55:36.393 --> 02:55:39.963 region:rollup2

INTO ANOTHER HOME.

02:55:43.466 --> 02:55:46.836 region:rollup2

02:55:45.735 --> 02:55:49.039 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

02:55:46.836 --> 02:55:50.607 region:rollup2

STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH SOMEONE

02:56:16.066 --> 02:56:19.402 region:rollup2
EMOTIONAL ISSUE THERE'S A

02:56:17.500 --> 02:56:20.236 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL ISSUE THERE SOME

02:56:19.402 --> 02:56:20.804 region:rollup2
CRISIS THAT HAPPENS.

02:56:20.236 --> 02:56:23.606 region:rollup2
LARGELY TRIGGERED BY TRAUMA

02:56:20.804 --> 02:56:26.176 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:56:23.606 --> 02:56:28.344 region:rollup2
THAT PERSON CAN CALL A HOTLINE

02:56:26.176 --> 02:56:30.313 region:rollup2
BAKER HAD SOMEONE TRY TO ADDRESS

02:56:28.344 --> 02:56:33.116 region:rollup2

02:56:48.665 --> 02:56:51.568 region:rollup2
IT'S INCREDIBLY PARTNER.

02:56:49.599 --> 02:56:53.470 region:rollup2

YOUNG CHILDREN GETTING BACK TO

02:59:25.855 --> 02:59:28.291 region:rollup2
BACK TO BASICS BACK TO THE

02:59:26.723 --> 02:59:29.559 region:rollup2
BABIES.

02:59:28.291 --> 02:59:30.260 region:rollup2
BIRTH THROUGH THREE THE MOST

02:59:29.559 --> 02:59:31.794 region:rollup2
RAPID PERIOD OF BRAIN

02:59:30.260 --> 02:59:33.696 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT.

02:59:31.794 --> 02:59:35.765 region:rollup2
THEY CAN BENEFIT FROM TYPES OF

02:59:33.696 --> 02:59:37.233 region:rollup2
POSITIVE SUPPORTS THAT COME FROM

02:59:35.765 --> 02:59:38.735 region:rollup2
SEPARATE STABILIZING FAMILY

02:59:37.233 --> 02:59:40.570 region:rollup2
INCOME AND OVERALL COMMUNITY

02:59:38.735 --> 02:59:42.105 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS. AND ACCESS TO HIGH

02:59:40.570 --> 02:59:42.672 region:rollup2
QUALITY CHILDCARE OPTIONS NEEDS

02:59:42.105 --> 02:59:44.874 region:rollup2
TO BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF

02:59:42.672 --> 02:59:46.476 region:rollup2
THIS.

02:59:44.874 --> 02:59:48.244 region:rollup2
I'M DOCTOR THOMPSON WHO SPOKE

02:59:46.476 --> 02:59:50.113 region:rollup2
EARLIER TODAY INCLUDES THE

02:59:48.244 --> 02:59:51.948 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO QUALITY CHILDCARE AS

02:59:50.113 --> 02:59:54.183 region:rollup2
ONE OF HIS PILLARS AND LOOKING

02:59:51.948 --> 02:59:55.351 region:rollup2
AT COMMUNITY BASED SOLUTIONS.

02:59:54.183 --> 02:59:56.786 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE DO HAVE TO

02:59:55.351 --> 02:59:58.354 region:rollup2
CONSIDER THE CHANGING DYNAMICS

02:59:56.786 --> 02:59:59.922 region:rollup2
THAT WERE ALSO DISCUSSED EARLIER

02:59:58.354 --> 03:00:01.457 region:rollup2
TODAY FOR FAMILIES.

02:59:59.922 --> 03:00:03.960 region:rollup2
I MOST FAMILIES HAVE ALL THE

03:00:01.457 --> 03:00:05.161 region:rollup2
ADULTS WORKING.

03:00:03.960 --> 03:00:07.030 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE EITHER A SINGLE PARENT

03:00:05.161 --> 03:00:09.098 region:rollup2
WORKING PARENT OR YOU HAVE TWO

03:00:07.030 --> 03:00:11.734 region:rollup2
PARENTS WORKING WHICH MEANS MOST

03:00:09.098 --> 03:00:14.337 region:rollup2
KIDS ARE IN SOME SORT OF CARE

03:00:11.734 --> 03:00:16.139 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE OF THE HOME EVERYDAY.

03:00:14.337 --> 03:00:17.707 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE ALSO KNOW IS LOW

03:00:16.139 --> 03:00:18.775 region:rollup2
INCOME FAMILIES ARE OFTEN IN

03:00:17.707 --> 03:00:20.643 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE JOBS WITH VERY

03:00:18.775 --> 03:00:22.378 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED SCHEDULES SCHEDULES

03:00:20.643 --> 03:00:24.781 region:rollup2
NONE OF US WOULD WANT.

03:00:22.378 --> 03:00:27.050 region:rollup2
AT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS AT STRANGE

03:00:24.781 --> 03:00:28.518 region:rollup2
HOURS THAT CHANGE WEEK TO WEEK

03:00:27.050 --> 03:00:30.086 region:rollup2
THAT IN ITSELF CAUSES A GOOD

03:00:28.518 --> 03:00:31.587 region:rollup2
DEAL OF STRESS.

03:00:30.086 --> 03:00:32.822 region:rollup2
I'M AT OUR AGENCY ALONE OVER

03:00:31.587 --> 03:00:34.023 region:rollup2
SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE

03:00:32.822 --> 03:00:36.059 region:rollup2
FAMILIES WE SERVE WORK THESE

03:00:34.023 --> 03:00:37.794 region:rollup2
NONTRADITIONAL HOURS AND THEIR

03:00:36.059 --> 03:00:39.195 region:rollup2
IN SERVICE INDUSTRIES. AND THIS

03:00:37.794 --> 03:00:40.697 region:rollup2
CREATES ADDITIONAL STRESSES

03:00:39.195 --> 03:00:42.231 region:rollup2
CONSTANT CHANGE IN PRESSURE TO

03:00:40.697 --> 03:00:44.200 region:rollup2
FIND ARRANGEMENTS FOR CARE ON

03:00:42.231 --> 03:00:45.935 region:rollup2
TOP OF THE EXISTING FINANCIAL

03:00:44.200 --> 03:00:47.603 region:rollup2
STRESSES THAT THEY'RE FACING.

03:00:45.935 --> 03:00:49.272 region:rollup2
WE DO BELIEVE THAT ACCESS TO

03:00:47.603 --> 03:00:51.307 region:rollup2
QUALITY CHILDCARE MITIGATE SOME

03:00:49.272 --> 03:00:53.009 region:rollup2
OF THE STRESSES AND IT CAN BE A

03:00:51.307 --> 03:00:54.977 region:rollup2
PREVENTION AS WELL AS AN EARLY

03:00:53.009 --> 03:00:56.846 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION. AND IF YOU HAVE

03:00:54.977 --> 03:00:57.380 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED CAREGIVERS WHO ARE

03:00:56.846 --> 03:00:59.015 region:rollup2
USING THAT TROMBONE FORMED

03:00:57.380 --> 03:01:00.950 region:rollup2
LANDS.

03:00:59.015 --> 03:01:04.387 region:rollup2
AND THEY CAN HELP IDENTIFY AND

03:01:00.950 --> 03:01:05.988 region:rollup2
MITIGATE SOME OF THESE CONCERNS.

03:01:04.387 --> 03:01:07.256 region:rollup2
SO I DID GO AND LOOK AT SOME OF

03:01:05.988 --> 03:01:10.126 region:rollup2
THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE

03:01:07.256 --> 03:01:11.160 region:rollup2
NATIONALLY AND CHILD TRENDS WHO

03:01:10.126 --> 03:01:12.295 region:rollup2
IS A LEADING NONPROFIT RESEARCH

03:01:11.160 --> 03:01:14.597 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION.

03:01:12.295 --> 03:01:16.232 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE LIVES

03:01:14.597 --> 03:01:17.266 region:rollup2
AND PROSPECTS OF CHILDREN. I'M

03:01:16.232 --> 03:01:18.801 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED SOME KEY

03:01:17.266 --> 03:01:20.536 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR POLICY

03:01:18.801 --> 03:01:22.739 region:rollup2
MAKERS TO SUPPORT THE WORK OF

03:01:20.536 --> 03:01:23.773 region:rollup2
EARLY CHILDHOOD. AND THE COMPLEX

03:01:22.739 --> 03:01:25.408 region:rollup2
NEEDS OF CHILDREN HAVE BEEN

03:01:23.773 --> 03:01:26.676 region:rollup2
EXPOSED TO TRAUMA THEIR

03:01:25.408 --> 03:01:28.111 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE

03:01:26.676 --> 03:01:29.779 region:rollup2
PROVIDING CHILDREN WITH AMPLE

03:01:28.111 --> 03:01:31.447 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY STABLE

03:01:29.779 --> 03:01:32.715 region:rollup2
CARE AND STRONG EARLY LEARNING

03:01:31.447 --> 03:01:34.317 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS.

03:01:32.715 --> 03:01:36.085 region:rollup2
INCREASING EASY PROFESSIONALS

03:01:34.317 --> 03:01:37.987 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE AND RESPOND

03:01:36.085 --> 03:01:39.088 region:rollup2
TO TRAUMA. AND EXPANDED

03:01:37.987 --> 03:01:40.523 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES THAT HELP EARLY

03:01:39.088 --> 03:01:42.892 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS CONNECT

03:01:40.523 --> 03:01:44.193 region:rollup2
FAMILIES TO COMMUNITY SERVICES A

03:01:42.892 --> 03:01:45.628 region:rollup2
FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER TYPE

03:01:44.193 --> 03:01:47.296 region:rollup2
MODEL.

03:01:45.628 --> 03:01:49.298 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE MADE SOME HEADWAY IN

03:01:47.296 --> 03:01:51.400 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IN THE NUMBER OF

03:01:49.298 --> 03:01:52.435 region:rollup2
CHILDREN WE SERVE LARGELY IN OUR

03:01:51.400 --> 03:01:54.070 region:rollup2
EXPANSION OF SERVICES TO FOUR

03:01:52.435 --> 03:01:55.271 region:rollup2
YEAR OLDS.

03:01:54.070 --> 03:01:57.140 region:rollup2
FOR THE BIRTH THROUGH THREE

03:01:55.271 --> 03:01:59.842 region:rollup2
GROUP WE REALLY ARE VERY BARELY

03:01:57.140 --> 03:02:01.344 region:rollup2
SCRATCHING THE SURFACE OF NEED

03:01:59.842 --> 03:02:02.512 region:rollup2
IN THE COMMUNITY. AND THE

03:02:01.344 --> 03:02:04.280 region:rollup2
AMERICANS AND STE IN THE

03:02:02.512 --> 03:02:05.948 region:rollup2
AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH

03:02:04.280 --> 03:02:07.150 region:rollup2
IS DONE A RECENT STUDY THAT

03:02:05.948 --> 03:02:08.451 region:rollup2
SHOWED THAT LESS THAN TEN

03:02:07.150 --> 03:02:09.619 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE VERY YOUNGEST

03:02:08.451 --> 03:02:11.621 region:rollup2
CHILDREN BIRTH TO THREE ARE

03:02:09.619 --> 03:02:13.289 region:rollup2
BEING SERVED. AND THOSE ARE KIDS

03:02:11.621 --> 03:02:15.091 region:rollup2
WHO ARE INCOME ELIGIBLE AND IN

03:02:13.289 --> 03:02:16.993 region:rollup2
THESE COMMUNITIES THAT WE'VE ALL

03:02:15.091 --> 03:02:18.461 region:rollup2
EXPRESS CONCERN FOR AND THIS

03:02:16.993 --> 03:02:21.497 region:rollup2
LEADS WOULD REALLY CRITICAL GAPS

03:02:18.461 --> 03:02:23.566 region:rollup2
FOR FAMILIES.

03:02:21.497 --> 03:02:26.068 region:rollup2
SO TO SOLUTIONS.

03:02:23.566 --> 03:02:27.637 region:rollup2
I CALIFORNIA HAS EXISTING HOUSE

03:02:26.068 --> 03:02:29.372 region:rollup2
ASSETS WHICH ARE AVAILABLE IN

03:02:27.637 --> 03:02:31.674 region:rollup2
COULD BE LEVERAGED AND EXPANDED

03:02:29.372 --> 03:02:33.476 region:rollup2
UPON. I CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY

03:02:31.674 --> 03:02:35.011 region:rollup2
LARGE HEAD START CONTRACT WITH

03:02:33.476 --> 03:02:35.878 region:rollup2
THE FEDERAL OF FEDERAL FUNDS

03:02:35.011 --> 03:02:36.913 region:rollup2
THAT ARE COMING TO LOCAL

03:02:35.878 --> 03:02:38.414 region:rollup2
JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE

03:02:36.913 --> 03:02:39.449 region:rollup2
STATE.

03:02:38.414 --> 03:02:41.117 region:rollup2
I HAVE THERE'S ABOUT A BILLION

03:02:39.449 --> 03:02:42.685 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN HEAD START FUNDING

03:02:41.117 --> 03:02:44.086 region:rollup2
THAT COMES TO CALIFORNIA. AND

03:02:42.685 --> 03:02:46.656 region:rollup2
THE UNIQUE THING ABOUT HEAD

03:02:44.086 --> 03:02:48.090 region:rollup2
START AND EARLY HEAD START IS IT

03:02:46.656 --> 03:02:50.293 region:rollup2
REALLY IS DESIGNED AS A POVERTY

03:02:48.090 --> 03:02:51.894 region:rollup2
ALLEVIATION PROGRAM AND ITS A

03:02:50.293 --> 03:02:52.962 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE SERVICE THAT LOOKS

03:02:51.894 --> 03:02:54.297 region:rollup2
AT MENTAL HEALTH AND FAMILY

03:02:52.962 --> 03:02:56.866 region:rollup2
SUPPORTS BEYOND JUST THE

03:02:54.297 --> 03:02:58.167 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM LEARNING ENVIRONMENT.

03:02:56.866 --> 03:02:59.335 region:rollup2
I THINK IT WOULD BE WORTHWHILE

03:02:58.167 --> 03:03:01.237 region:rollup2
FOR US TO ALL CONSIDER WHAT

03:02:59.335 --> 03:03:02.805 region:rollup2
WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE IF WE

03:03:01.237 --> 03:03:04.674 region:rollup2
OFFERED THAT TO MORE OF OUR

03:03:02.805 --> 03:03:06.275 region:rollup2
CHILDREN IN POVERTY. SO HOW DO

03:03:04.674 --> 03:03:07.510 region:rollup2
WE TAKE THAT BASED ON THE

03:03:06.275 --> 03:03:08.077 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT HAD START IS

03:03:07.510 --> 03:03:10.479 region:rollup2
DOING AND EXPAND THAT EFFORT

03:03:08.077 --> 03:03:12.181 region:rollup2
OUT.

03:03:10.479 --> 03:03:13.950 region:rollup2
I WE OFFICE WE ALSO OFFER A

03:03:12.181 --> 03:03:15.551 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE

03:03:13.950 --> 03:03:17.753 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS IN A VARIETY OF

03:03:15.551 --> 03:03:19.322 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT MODALITIES. I'M FRANK

03:03:17.753 --> 03:03:20.289 region:rollup2
MENTIONED THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM

03:03:19.322 --> 03:03:22.158 region:rollup2
WHERE FAMILIES HAVE AN

03:03:20.289 --> 03:03:24.193 region:rollup2
ENTITLEMENT TO CHILDCARE WE ALSO

03:03:22.158 --> 03:03:26.162 region:rollup2
HAVE A ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT

03:03:24.193 --> 03:03:28.130 region:rollup2
GENERAL CHILDCARE PROGRAM FOR

03:03:26.162 --> 03:03:30.233 region:rollup2
LOW INCOME WORKING FAMILIES. BUT

03:03:28.130 --> 03:03:31.667 region:rollup2
MORE ACCESS IS NEEDED AND THIS

03:03:30.233 --> 03:03:33.469 region:rollup2
IS WHERE MY.

03:03:31.667 --> 03:03:35.137 region:rollup2
MY TWO CENTS FOR THIS YEAR'S

03:03:33.469 --> 03:03:36.706 region:rollup2
ASKS COMES AND I'M WE REALLY

03:03:35.137 --> 03:03:38.708 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY

03:03:36.706 --> 03:03:40.843 region:rollup2
TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR FAMILIES

03:03:38.708 --> 03:03:42.678 region:rollup2
THE SHARE. OF THE FEDERAL BUDGET

03:03:40.843 --> 03:03:44.514 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS RECENTLY SIGNED DOES

03:03:42.678 --> 03:03:45.715 region:rollup2
INCLUDE AN EXPANSION IN THE

03:03:44.514 --> 03:03:47.016 region:rollup2
FEDERAL CHILD CARE AND

03:03:45.715 --> 03:03:48.684 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT.

03:03:47.016 --> 03:03:50.987 region:rollup2
SO THERE SHOULD BE ADDITIONAL

03:03:48.684 --> 03:03:52.321 region:rollup2
ACCESS COMING TO CALIFORNIA AND

03:03:50.987 --> 03:03:54.390 region:rollup2
WE'RE HOPING THAT THE STATE IS

03:03:52.321 --> 03:03:56.225 region:rollup2
ABLE TO MATCH AND GO ABOVE AND

03:03:54.390 --> 03:03:57.693 region:rollup2
BEYOND THOSE EFFORTS.

03:03:56.225 --> 03:04:00.530 region:rollup2
WE ALSO KNOW THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

03:03:57.693 --> 03:04:02.365 region:rollup2
THAT YOU SEE PROFESSIONALS.

03:04:00.530 --> 03:04:04.567 region:rollup2
HAVE ACCESS TO TROMBONE FORM

03:04:02.365 --> 03:04:05.768 region:rollup2
TRAINING AND I ONE OF THE THINGS

03:04:04.567 --> 03:04:07.803 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE DONE KIND OF

03:04:05.768 --> 03:04:10.439 region:rollup2
CROSSING SECTORS IN THIS PAST

03:04:07.803 --> 03:04:12.675 region:rollup2
YEAR IS CREATED A. FOSTER CARE

03:04:10.439 --> 03:04:14.710 region:rollup2
BRIDGE PROGRAM FOR CHILDCARE.

03:04:12.675 --> 03:04:16.746 region:rollup2
AND THE UNIQUE THING ABOUT THAT

03:04:14.710 --> 03:04:19.015 region:rollup2
IS IT INCLUDED TRAUMA INFORMED

03:04:16.746 --> 03:04:20.750 region:rollup2
CARE TRAINING FOR THE PROVIDERS

03:04:19.015 --> 03:04:22.051 region:rollup2
WHO ARE WORKING WITH THE

03:04:20.750 --> 03:04:22.618 region:rollup2
CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE.

03:04:22.051 --> 03:04:23.986 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S A GOOD

03:04:22.618 --> 03:04:25.755 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATION IT'S AN

03:04:23.986 --> 03:04:27.590 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO SEE HOW

03:04:25.755 --> 03:04:29.191 region:rollup2
THIS WORKS AND WE'RE DOING A LOT

03:04:27.590 --> 03:04:31.627 region:rollup2
OF WORK TO TRY TO BUILD. THE

03:04:29.191 --> 03:04:33.629 region:rollup2
BRIDGE BETWEEN THOSE TWO SYSTEMS

03:04:31.627 --> 03:04:35.197 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A

03:04:33.629 --> 03:04:36.899 region:rollup2
PLACE YOU COULD CONTINUE TO LOOK

03:04:35.197 --> 03:04:38.868 region:rollup2
TO BUILD.

03:04:36.899 --> 03:04:40.503 region:rollup2
AND I'M AYE OF ALSO WANTED TO

03:04:38.868 --> 03:04:42.305 region:rollup2
MENTION HOME VISITING I KNOW IT

03:04:40.503 --> 03:04:44.407 region:rollup2
CAME UP EARLIER THAT CALIFORNIA

03:04:42.305 --> 03:04:45.575 region:rollup2
DOES HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

03:04:44.407 --> 03:04:47.643 region:rollup2
HOME VISITING MODELS.

03:04:45.575 --> 03:04:50.079 region:rollup2
AND THEY ARE FUNDED BY A VARIETY

03:04:47.643 --> 03:04:52.882 region:rollup2
OF SOURCES INCLUDING FEDERAL. OF

03:04:50.079 --> 03:04:54.083 region:rollup2
FUNDS EARLY HEAD START LOCAL TO

03:04:52.882 --> 03:04:55.618 region:rollup2
A FIRST FIVE COMMISSIONS.

03:04:54.083 --> 03:04:57.586 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE NOT CONSISTENTLY

03:04:55.618 --> 03:04:59.455 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY

03:04:57.586 --> 03:05:00.456 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT THE STATE I'M AND

03:04:59.455 --> 03:05:02.258 region:rollup2
THESE WOULD BE OTHER POWER

03:05:00.456 --> 03:05:04.026 region:rollup2

03:06:21.237 --> 03:06:22.972 region:rollup2
ERR ON MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE.

03:06:21.871 --> 03:06:24.874 region:rollup2

YOU KNOW.

03:06:33.215 --> 03:06:36.886 region:rollup2
THE MAGIC.

03:06:34.617 --> 03:06:38.821 region:rollup2
THE BOX

MILLION DOLLARS YOU WANT TO DO

03:06:40.423 --> 03:06:44.260 region:rollup2
SOMETHING TODAY BESIDES THE FACT

03:06:42.425 --> 03:06:45.294 region:rollup2
THAT WE KNOW.

03:06:44.260 --> 03:06:46.262 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY FROM THAT WELFARE

03:06:45.294 --> 03:06:48.297 region:rollup2
DIRECTORS AND THAT.

03:06:46.262 --> 03:06:49.565 region:rollup2
CHILD CARE AND

03:06:48.297 --> 03:06:51.600 region:rollup2
DEC WORLD KIND OF WHAT THE ASK

03:06:49.565 --> 03:06:52.802 region:rollup2
OUR WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

03:06:51.600 --> 03:06:54.270 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR REMEDIES WOULD HAVE

03:06:52.802 --> 03:06:55.905 region:rollup2
OUT THERE LET'S SAY ALL OF A

03:06:54.270 --> 03:06:57.506 region:rollup2
SUDDEN EVERY. YOU KNOW

03:06:55.905 --> 03:06:58.641 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTNERS HOW TO SCORE AND

03:06:57.506 --> 03:07:00.242 region:rollup2
AND SOME PEOPLE OFF THE CHARTS

03:06:58.641 --> 03:07:01.977 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO GIVE. GRANTS TO

03:07:00.242 --> 03:07:03.913 region:rollup2
NONPROFITS A SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

03:07:01.977 --> 03:07:04.480 region:rollup2
DO STUFF YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD WE.

03:07:03.913 --> 03:07:07.316 region:rollup2
DO IF ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAD

03:07:04.480 --> 03:07:10.352 region:rollup2
ONE.

03:07:07.316 --> 03:07:11.887 region:rollup2
BUT BASICALLY A DIAGNOSIS FOR

03:07:10.352 --> 03:07:13.956 region:rollup2
ALL THESE KIDS ACROSS CALIFORNIA

03:07:11.887 --> 03:07:14.824 region:rollup2
INTO A POTENTIAL.

03:07:13.956 --> 03:07:18.360 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A SOUND

03:07:14.824 --> 03:07:19.562 region:rollup2
BEST.

03:07:18.360 --> 03:07:20.696 region:rollup2
DURING A FOR SHOWING HER HOW AM

03:07:19.562 --> 03:07:21.363 region:rollup2
I I MEAN THE FIRST THING WE

03:07:20.696 --> 03:07:22.298 region:rollup2
WOULD DO REALLY WOULD BE

03:07:21.363 --> 03:07:24.066 region:rollup2
RESTRUCTURING SCHOOLS AND THE

03:07:22.298 --> 03:07:25.201 region:rollup2
WAYS IN WHICH THEY INTERACT WITH

03:07:24.066 --> 03:07:26.235 region:rollup2
THE STUDENTS.

03:07:25.201 --> 03:07:27.703 region:rollup2
SO THAT MEANS THAT YOU KNOW

03:07:26.235 --> 03:07:29.405 region:rollup2
DOCTOR BURKE HARRIS TALKED ABOUT

03:07:27.703 --> 03:07:30.906 region:rollup2
HAVING MINDFULNESS HAVING THINGS

03:07:29.405 --> 03:07:33.309 region:rollup2
THAT ARE PART OF THE SCHOOL DAY

03:07:30.906 --> 03:07:34.543 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD HELP TO BUFFER THAT

03:07:33.309 --> 03:07:36.112 region:rollup2
TRAUMA THAT STUDENTS ARE

03:07:34.543 --> 03:07:37.980 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING. HELP THEM LEARN

03:07:36.112 --> 03:07:40.249 region:rollup2
HOW TO REGULATE THEIR EMOTIONS.

03:07:37.980 --> 03:07:41.016 region:rollup2
IT IN WAYS THAT WE KNOW ARE

03:07:40.249 --> 03:07:42.384 region:rollup2
PREVENTIVE SO THAT WOULD BE ONE

03:07:41.016 --> 03:07:44.620 region:rollup2
OF THE HARDEST TO HEALTH

03:07:42.384 --> 03:07:45.387 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALS ON FUNDING YES FOR

03:07:44.620 --> 03:07:46.188 region:rollup2
OF AND CERTAINLY THAT WOULD BE

03:07:45.387 --> 03:07:47.523 region:rollup2
NECESSARY BUT THERE ALSO ARE

03:07:46.188 --> 03:07:49.825 region:rollup2
THINGS WE CAN DO AS FROM A

03:07:47.523 --> 03:07:51.260 region:rollup2
POPULATION BASED PERSPECTIVE FOR

03:07:49.825 --> 03:07:52.661 region:rollup2
EVERYONE. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU

03:07:51.260 --> 03:07:54.463 region:rollup2
HAVE SCORED THE YOU KNOW THAT

03:07:52.661 --> 03:07:57.366 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A HIGH LEVEL LEVEL OF

03:07:54.463 --> 03:07:58.634 region:rollup2
CONCENTRATED TRAUMA AND IN MANY

03:07:57.366 --> 03:08:00.503 region:rollup2
INSTANCES WHEN WE DO THE A SCORE

03:07:58.634 --> 03:08:02.805 region:rollup2
AS A REMINDER WE DON'T HAVE THE

03:08:00.503 --> 03:08:04.373 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY TRAUMA AS WELL. SO YOU

03:08:02.805 --> 03:08:06.709 region:rollup2
COULD HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL A SCORE

03:08:04.373 --> 03:08:08.310 region:rollup2
OF ZERO BUT STILL BE TRAUMATIZED

03:08:06.709 --> 03:08:09.478 region:rollup2
BY SOME OF THE COMMUNITY TRAUMAS

03:08:08.310 --> 03:08:11.347 region:rollup2
THAT ARE HAPPENING BECAUSE YOU

03:08:09.478 --> 03:08:13.315 region:rollup2
LIVE WITHIN THAT COMMUNITY AS

03:08:11.347 --> 03:08:14.884 region:rollup2
WELL AND SO THAT THAT WOULD BE

03:08:13.315 --> 03:08:15.784 region:rollup2
REALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT WOULD

03:08:14.884 --> 03:08:17.453 region:rollup2
HAVE A WAY OF BEING ABLE TO

03:08:15.784 --> 03:08:20.422 region:rollup2
PROVIDE. A BUFFER FOR WHAT'S

03:08:17.453 --> 03:08:20.956 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IN ADDITION TO THE

03:08:20.422 --> 03:08:21.490 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMATIC INVESTMENTS.

03:08:20.956 --> 03:08:22.791 region:rollup2
FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

03:08:21.490 --> 03:08:24.527 region:rollup2
CLINICAL.

03:08:22.791 --> 03:08:26.195 region:rollup2
YEAH THAT'S A SOME OF THESE ARE

03:08:24.527 --> 03:08:27.096 region:rollup2
CISPA SUCKS SOCIETAL ON PARTS

03:08:26.195 --> 03:08:28.998 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY IN.

03:08:27.096 --> 03:08:30.065 region:rollup2
IN OUR J. GENERATIONAL POVERTY

03:08:28.998 --> 03:08:31.333 region:rollup2
AND JUST LIKE YOU KNOW MILLIONS

03:08:30.065 --> 03:08:31.867 region:rollup2
AND BILLIONS TO TO IMPACT THAT.

03:08:31.333 --> 03:08:32.935 region:rollup2
BUT BUT LET'S SAY ALL OF A

03:08:31.867 --> 03:08:33.435 region:rollup2
SUDDEN.

03:08:32.935 --> 03:08:35.371 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF YOU DID THIS

03:08:33.435 --> 03:08:36.672 region:rollup2
SCREENING WOULD BE PRIMARILY FOR

03:08:35.371 --> 03:08:38.007 region:rollup2
YOUNGER KIDS WRITINGS OF THE

03:08:36.672 --> 03:08:40.176 region:rollup2

03:10:15.070 --> 03:10:17.773 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE BOARD EVENLY THERE'S

03:10:16.472 --> 03:10:19.008 region:rollup2
NOT CONSISTENCY IN THE

03:10:17.773 --> 03:10:20.643 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT PROGRAM

03:10:19.008 --> 03:10:21.944 region:rollup2
SO ON THE ONE LEVEL IF YOU WANT

03:10:20.643 --> 03:10:23.612 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT SYSTEMIC CHANGES

03:10:21.944 --> 03:10:24.713 region:rollup2
USING THE SYSTEM THAT'S ALREADY

03:10:23.612 --> 03:10:26.782 region:rollup2
IN PLACE THE SYSTEM THAT'S

03:10:24.713 --> 03:10:27.783 region:rollup2
ALREADY IN PLACE IN MY. PERSONAL

03:10:26.782 --> 03:10:28.851 region:rollup2
OPINION I THINK MY COLLEAGUES

03:10:27.783 --> 03:10:29.785 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE AGREEING WITH ME.

03:10:28.851 --> 03:10:31.587 region:rollup2
DOESN'T WORK THE WAY IT'S

03:10:29.785 --> 03:10:32.588 region:rollup2
DESIGNED WORK RIGHT NOW AND SO

03:10:31.587 --> 03:10:34.189 region:rollup2
IF YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY MAKE AND

03:10:32.588 --> 03:10:35.357 region:rollup2
MAJOR IMPACT YOU WANT TO SCREEN

IN THE FAMILY TO KNOW WHAT'S

03:10:39.295 --> 03:10:41.397 region:rollup2
GOING ON THE TRUTH IS THAT

THEY'RE THEY'RE FINDING OUT

03:10:41.397 --> 03:10:43.666 region:rollup2

INTERVENTIONS THEY NEED NOW TO

03:10:59.715 --> 03:11:02.751 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION ABOUT WE HAVE THE

03:11:01.050 --> 03:11:03.619 region:rollup2
SCALE OF COST AND HOW DO YOU HOW

03:11:02.751 --> 03:11:05.487 region:rollup2
DO YOU SKILLED OUT ONE OF THE

03:11:03.619 --> 03:11:06.755 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS WE HAVE THIS YEAR. IS

03:11:05.487 --> 03:11:08.791 region:rollup2
TO MAKE AN INVESTMENT IN SCHOOLS

03:11:06.755 --> 03:11:11.226 region:rollup2
TO PILOT TRYING TO CHANGE THE

03:11:08.791 --> 03:11:13.696 region:rollup2
WAY SCHOOLS OPERATE WITH A

03:11:11.226 --> 03:11:15.197 region:rollup2
TRAUMA INFORM SCHOOL MENTALITY

03:11:13.696 --> 03:11:16.365 region:rollup2
IT DROMUND FROM SCHOOL PROGRAM

03:11:15.197 --> 03:11:17.866 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU BASICALLY COME IN AND

03:11:16.365 --> 03:11:18.834 region:rollup2
YOU CAN MAKE AN INVESTMENT. IN A

03:11:17.866 --> 03:11:19.868 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICT WHERE YOU'RE

03:11:18.834 --> 03:11:21.003 region:rollup2
GOING TO DO THAT YOU COULD

03:11:19.868 --> 03:11:22.938 region:rollup2
SCREEN ALL THOSE KIDS IN THAT

03:11:21.003 --> 03:11:23.839 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICT AT SCHOOL. RIGHT

CRAWL ALL OVER THE MAP PROBABLY

03:11:25.174 --> 03:11:27.409 region:rollup2
RIGHT IN SOME COMMUNITIES ARE

03:11:26.508 --> 03:11:29.712 region:rollup2
GONNA BE VERY HAPPY ON THE DRAMA

03:11:27.409 --> 03:11:30.412 region:rollup2
SIDE. AND THE REALITIES YOU CAN

03:11:29.712 --> 03:11:31.613 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY PUT.

03:11:30.412 --> 03:11:32.181 region:rollup2
AT A MUCH LOWER COST THAN YOU

03:11:31.613 --> 03:11:33.582 region:rollup2
WOULD IF YOU WERE TRYING TO

03:11:32.181 --> 03:11:34.483 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALLY TREAT KIDS OUT IN

03:11:33.582 --> 03:11:36.352 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY IF YOU TRY TO

03:11:34.483 --> 03:11:37.519 region:rollup2
BUILD THE RESILIENCY THAT IMMUNE

03:11:36.352 --> 03:11:39.188 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. ID I KIND OF TRY TO

03:11:37.519 --> 03:11:41.156 region:rollup2
PROMOTE EARLIER YOU ACTUALLY PUT

03:11:39.188 --> 03:11:42.691 region:rollup2
INSIDE THE SCHOOL THE TRAUMA

03:11:41.156 --> 03:11:43.993 region:rollup2
INFORMED PROVIDER THE PERSON WHO

03:11:42.691 --> 03:11:45.060 region:rollup2
WAS THERE AT THE RESOURCE TO THE

03:11:43.993 --> 03:11:46.895 region:rollup2
TEACHERS AS THE RESOURCE TO THE

03:11:45.060 --> 03:11:48.230 region:rollup2
STUDENTS NOT JUST INDIVIDUALLY

03:11:46.895 --> 03:11:49.131 region:rollup2
BUT COLLECTIVELY AND THAT IDEA

03:11:48.230 --> 03:11:50.666 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE

03:11:49.131 --> 03:11:51.834 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY RESILIENCY. OUT OF

03:11:50.666 --> 03:11:53.902 region:rollup2
HAVING ALL THOSE CHILDREN BE IN

03:11:51.834 --> 03:11:56.138 region:rollup2
THE SAME PLACE AND BE AT A PLACE

03:11:53.902 --> 03:11:57.673 region:rollup2
OF EDUCATED ARE OF ELEVATED ON

03:11:56.138 --> 03:11:58.640 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION WITH ONE ANOTHER

03:11:57.673 --> 03:11:59.975 region:rollup2
JUST MAKE ME PRACTICAL LEVEL TO

03:11:58.640 --> 03:12:02.111 region:rollup2
SAY THERE'S AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

03:11:59.975 --> 03:12:02.277 region:rollup2
THAT HAS. FOR KINDERGARTEN CLASS

03:12:02.111 --> 03:12:03.712 region:rollup2
YOU

03:12:02.277 --> 03:12:07.383 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S.

03:12:03.712 --> 03:12:08.684 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE KIDS.

03:12:07.383 --> 03:12:10.686 region:rollup2
ROGER RIGHT LET'S SAY.

03:12:08.684 --> 03:12:11.920 region:rollup2
ARE A QUARTER OF THE KITS

03:12:10.686 --> 03:12:13.856 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T ACES SCORE FIVE

03:12:11.920 --> 03:12:15.090 region:rollup2
BY RACH.

03:12:13.856 --> 03:12:16.325 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU HAD THOSE TWELVE

03:12:15.090 --> 03:12:17.693 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE.

03:12:16.325 --> 03:12:19.528 region:rollup2
GET SO WHAT WOULD YOU GIVE LIKE

03:12:17.693 --> 03:12:20.396 region:rollup2
IT'S KID LIKE.

03:12:19.528 --> 03:12:21.997 region:rollup2
IT'S THE WRONG TERM LIKE A

03:12:20.396 --> 03:12:24.400 region:rollup2
VOUCHER FOR THEY CAN GO LIKE A

03:12:21.997 --> 03:12:26.335 region:rollup2
COUPON TO GO. GET A SERVICE OR

03:12:24.400 --> 03:12:27.803 region:rollup2
WOULD YOU TRY TO BRING SOMEONE

03:12:26.335 --> 03:12:28.837 region:rollup2
IN THE SERVICE WILL IN HOUSE ALL

03:12:27.803 --> 03:12:30.039 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE WOULD BE IN THE

03:12:28.837 --> 03:12:31.774 region:rollup2
SCHOOL WOULD BE A SCHOOL BASED

03:12:30.039 --> 03:12:32.441 region:rollup2
HEALTH SERVICE. THAT THE SAID

03:12:31.774 --> 03:12:34.009 region:rollup2
THE SCHOOL ESSENTIALLY IS

03:12:32.441 --> 03:12:35.411 region:rollup2
GETTING THE SOCIAL WORKER THE

03:12:34.009 --> 03:12:36.512 region:rollup2
CARE PROVIDER WHO HAS THE

03:12:35.411 --> 03:12:38.447 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO BRING IN OTHER

03:12:36.512 --> 03:12:39.014 region:rollup2
RESOURCES IF NECESSARY BUT THAT

03:12:38.447 --> 03:12:40.449 region:rollup2
PERSON IS THE LOCUS FOR THE

03:12:39.014 --> 03:12:41.617 region:rollup2
CARE.

03:12:40.449 --> 03:12:43.085 region:rollup2
IN THE SCHOOL BECAUSE YOU WANT

03:12:41.617 --> 03:12:44.753 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO HAS DAY TO DAY

03:12:43.085 --> 03:12:46.622 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIPS WITH TEACHERS

03:12:44.753 --> 03:12:48.190 region:rollup2
STAFF AND THE STUDENTS BECAUSE

03:12:46.622 --> 03:12:50.059 region:rollup2
PART OF TRAUMA INFORMED CARE IS

03:12:48.190 --> 03:12:51.427 region:rollup2
ABOUT RELATIONSHIP BUILDING AND

03:12:50.059 --> 03:12:53.028 region:rollup2
TRUST AND RIGHT SO YOU'RE

03:12:51.427 --> 03:12:54.096 region:rollup2
ALREADY IN THAT THE SYSTEMS ARE

03:12:53.028 --> 03:12:55.564 region:rollup2
SUPPORTER THERE IN THE SCHOOL.

03:12:54.096 --> 03:12:56.832 region:rollup2
AND VOUCHERS REQUIRES THE FAMILY

03:12:55.564 --> 03:12:58.801 region:rollup2
TO GO FIND CARE PROVIDER AND

03:12:56.832 --> 03:13:00.402 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT THE SYSTEM IS

03:12:58.801 --> 03:13:01.036 region:rollup2
FAILING TO DO RIGHT NOW.

03:13:00.402 --> 03:13:02.538 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO TO GIVE TWENTY FIVE I

03:13:01.036 --> 03:13:03.605 region:rollup2
MEAN JUST TO USE YOUR EXAMPLE IF

03:13:02.538 --> 03:13:05.340 region:rollup2
YOU'VE TWENTY FIVE KIDS OF A

03:13:03.605 --> 03:13:06.675 region:rollup2
SCORE FIVE OR HIGHER YOU ALSO OF

03:13:05.340 --> 03:13:08.477 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE ONE THAT'S FOR THAT'S

03:13:06.675 --> 03:13:10.279 region:rollup2
THREE THAT'S TO THAT SEVEN THAT

03:13:08.477 --> 03:13:11.180 region:rollup2
RIGHT LIKE SO. YOU YOU I MEAN IF

03:13:10.279 --> 03:13:12.347 region:rollup2
YOU IF YOU DON'T WANT TWENTY

03:13:11.180 --> 03:13:13.882 region:rollup2
FIVE PERCENT ARE ALREADY HAD A

03:13:12.347 --> 03:13:15.084 region:rollup2
SCORE FIVE OR HIGHER YOU REALLY

03:13:13.882 --> 03:13:16.351 region:rollup2
NEED TO ALSO BE THINKING ABOUT

03:13:15.084 --> 03:13:18.754 region:rollup2
THE THE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT IN

03:13:16.351 --> 03:13:21.356 region:rollup2
GENERAL AS WELL. NOT JUST

03:13:18.754 --> 03:13:23.358 region:rollup2
LITERALLY A CLASSROOM FULL OF

03:13:21.356 --> 03:13:24.626 region:rollup2
STUDENTS WHO ARE TRAUMATIZED.

03:13:23.358 --> 03:13:27.529 region:rollup2
I WOULD ADD IT SCREENING IS DONE

03:13:24.626 --> 03:13:27.930 region:rollup2
ROUTINELY IN SCHOOLS ARM OR DONE

03:13:27.529 --> 03:13:29.998 region:rollup2
BY PEDIATRICIANS.

03:13:27.930 --> 03:13:31.934 region:rollup2
.

03:13:29.998 --> 03:13:33.669 region:rollup2
THAT REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE

03:13:31.934 --> 03:13:35.771 region:rollup2
SCREENING OCCURS THAT THERE

03:13:33.669 --> 03:13:37.673 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE STRONG CONNECTIONS

03:13:35.771 --> 03:13:38.440 region:rollup2
BETWEEN. THE SCHOOL THE SCHOOL

03:13:37.673 --> 03:13:40.109 region:rollup2
THAN THE PHYSICAL HEALTH

03:13:38.440 --> 03:13:41.143 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AND SOCIAL SERVICES

03:13:40.109 --> 03:13:42.177 region:rollup2
AGENCY

03:13:41.143 --> 03:13:44.146 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD BE EASY FOR THEM.

03:13:42.177 --> 03:13:45.914 region:rollup2
TO HELP.

03:13:44.146 --> 03:13:47.115 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TO CONNECT WITH US TO

03:13:45.914 --> 03:13:49.084 region:rollup2
GET SERVICES TO FAMILIES THAT

03:13:47.115 --> 03:13:50.419 region:rollup2
ARE ALREADY.

03:13:49.084 --> 03:13:51.987 region:rollup2
YOU NO AVAILABLE THEIR THEIR

03:13:50.419 --> 03:13:54.523 region:rollup2
THEIR PEOPLE FOR GOOD BECAUSE

03:13:51.987 --> 03:13:56.258 region:rollup2
THEY LIVE ISOLATED DRAMATIC WAYS

03:13:54.523 --> 03:13:57.693 region:rollup2
WHO ARE DISCONNECTED SO I THINK.

03:13:56.258 --> 03:13:59.228 region:rollup2
I THINK

03:13:57.693 --> 03:14:01.163 region:rollup2
A CONNECTIVE TISSUE BETWEEN THAT

03:13:59.228 --> 03:14:03.432 region:rollup2
FRONTLINE.

03:14:01.163 --> 03:14:06.235 region:rollup2
SCREENER AND THE AND THE THE

03:14:03.432 --> 03:14:07.903 region:rollup2
BACK AND SOCIAL SERVICES I THINK

03:14:06.235 --> 03:14:09.404 region:rollup2
IS THAT IS A COST EFFECTIVE AND

03:14:07.903 --> 03:14:10.873 region:rollup2
PROBABLY.

03:14:09.404 --> 03:14:11.940 region:rollup2
RELATIVELY SMALL AND SORT OF THE

03:14:10.873 --> 03:14:12.407 region:rollup2
GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS TYPE OF

03:14:11.940 --> 03:14:15.177 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

03:14:12.407 --> 03:14:16.178 region:rollup2
.

03:14:15.177 --> 03:14:16.612 region:rollup2
I THINK WE WE ALSO WOULD DO IF I

03:14:16.178 --> 03:14:17.913 region:rollup2
COULD.

03:14:16.612 --> 03:14:19.648 region:rollup2
JUST SORT OF.

03:14:17.913 --> 03:14:21.049 region:rollup2
REPEAT

03:14:19.648 --> 03:14:22.651 region:rollup2
THERE'S THIS THERE'S THIS

03:14:21.049 --> 03:14:25.087 region:rollup2
DISCONNECT NATIONALLY I THINK

03:14:22.651 --> 03:14:26.822 region:rollup2
BETWEEN WHAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

03:14:25.087 --> 03:14:28.290 region:rollup2
MEANS AND WHAT THE H. HAS

03:14:26.822 --> 03:14:30.859 region:rollup2
RESOURCE SAYS.

03:14:28.290 --> 03:14:32.728 region:rollup2
AND AS LONG AS THE BIG GATE

03:14:30.859 --> 03:14:33.595 region:rollup2
TO.

03:14:32.728 --> 03:14:36.365 region:rollup2
SORT OF.

03:14:33.595 --> 03:14:38.333 region:rollup2
INTENSIVE THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS

03:14:36.365 --> 03:14:41.303 region:rollup2
AND FLEXIBLE TYPES OF OPTIONS

03:14:38.333 --> 03:14:42.938 region:rollup2
IS A DIAGNOSIS.

03:14:41.303 --> 03:14:44.173 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT'S IN THE DSM IT'S

03:14:42.938 --> 03:14:46.208 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA WAIT TILL IT TILL

03:14:44.173 --> 03:14:48.544 region:rollup2
IT'S TOO LATE. AND YOU DON'T

03:14:46.208 --> 03:14:50.379 region:rollup2
CURE A SAYS WITH A FIFTY MINUTE

03:14:48.544 --> 03:14:52.981 region:rollup2
HOUR ON MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY.

03:14:50.379 --> 03:14:54.650 region:rollup2
THE IN THERAPY WE NEED FLEXIBLE.

03:14:52.981 --> 03:14:56.485 region:rollup2
CREATIVE

03:14:54.650 --> 03:14:58.353 region:rollup2
SERVICE SAYS THAT ARE BROUGHT TO

03:14:56.485 --> 03:14:59.521 region:rollup2
KIDS WHERE THEY WHERE THEY ARE.

03:14:58.353 --> 03:15:01.990 region:rollup2
AND.

03:14:59.521 --> 03:15:03.091 region:rollup2
AGAIN NO DISRESPECT OR

03:15:01.990 --> 03:15:05.127 region:rollup2
CRITICISM OF EXISTING

03:15:03.091 --> 03:15:06.061 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS WHO ARE WORKING

03:15:05.127 --> 03:15:08.363 region:rollup2
THEIR* OFF EVERY DAY. BUT

03:15:06.061 --> 03:15:10.632 region:rollup2
BUT THIS.

03:15:08.363 --> 03:15:11.200 region:rollup2
THAT THE SYSTEMS MANY SYSTEMS

03:15:10.632 --> 03:15:12.234 region:rollup2
INCLUDING THE CHILD WELFARE

03:15:11.200 --> 03:15:14.036 region:rollup2
SYSTEM

03:15:12.234 --> 03:15:15.270 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN TOO SLOW TO

03:15:14.036 --> 03:15:17.172 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS ACES IS

03:15:15.270 --> 03:15:18.974 region:rollup2
SERIOUS.

03:15:17.172 --> 03:15:20.876 region:rollup2
ARM AND IT IS THE BUSINESS OF

03:15:18.974 --> 03:15:22.678 region:rollup2
CHILD WELFARE IT IS THE BUSINESS

03:15:20.876 --> 03:15:24.446 region:rollup2
OF EDUCATION IT IS THE BUSINESS

03:15:22.678 --> 03:15:26.014 region:rollup2
THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NOT JUST

03:15:24.446 --> 03:15:27.616 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ON THE OUTSIDE THAT WE

03:15:26.014 --> 03:15:29.518 region:rollup2
LOOK AT AND WAIT FOR THINGS TO

03:15:27.616 --> 03:15:30.953 region:rollup2
GET REALLY BAD. BEFORE WE DECIDE

03:15:29.518 --> 03:15:32.254 region:rollup2
TO INTERVENE.

03:15:30.953 --> 03:15:34.356 region:rollup2
AND AND I WOULD SAY THERE'S

03:15:32.254 --> 03:15:36.758 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES IN THE EARLY CHILDHOOD

03:15:34.356 --> 03:15:38.727 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. WHERE YOU COULD TAKE

03:15:36.758 --> 03:15:39.595 region:rollup2
THAT MODEL FROM HEAD START WHERE

03:15:38.727 --> 03:15:41.029 region:rollup2
THERE IS A MENTAL HEALTH

03:15:39.595 --> 03:15:43.098 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONER ASSIGNED TO EVERY

03:15:41.029 --> 03:15:45.200 region:rollup2
CLASSROOM IN EVERY EARLY HEAD

03:15:43.098 --> 03:15:46.268 region:rollup2
START EXPERIENCE WHAT WOULD THAT

03:15:45.200 --> 03:15:47.236 region:rollup2
LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU TOOK IT TO

03:15:46.268 --> 03:15:48.537 region:rollup2
KINDERGARTEN?

03:15:47.236 --> 03:15:49.938 region:rollup2
I I THINK WE NEED TO LEARN FROM

03:15:48.537 --> 03:15:51.106 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT HAVE WORKED AND I

03:15:49.938 --> 03:15:52.941 region:rollup2
WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THE

03:15:51.106 --> 03:15:54.243 region:rollup2
REFERENCE EARLIER TO INFANT

03:15:52.941 --> 03:15:56.445 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH IS CRITICALLY

03:15:54.243 --> 03:15:58.747 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT. AND THE SOONER YOU

03:15:56.445 --> 03:16:00.549 region:rollup2
INTERVENE THE SOONER THERE'S A

03:15:58.747 --> 03:16:02.684 region:rollup2
PLAN THE SOONER WE START

03:16:00.549 --> 03:16:04.953 region:rollup2
MITIGATION AND THE LESS PROBLEMS

03:16:02.684 --> 03:16:06.722 region:rollup2
THERE ARE DOWN THE ROAD. AND

03:16:04.953 --> 03:16:07.489 region:rollup2
WHAT'S MISSING IS THAT THE

03:16:06.722 --> 03:16:09.024 region:rollup2
CRITICAL SUPPORT TO THE

03:16:07.489 --> 03:16:10.525 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS.

03:16:09.024 --> 03:16:12.294 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT IS PART OF EARLY

03:16:10.525 --> 03:16:13.729 region:rollup2
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION CHILD

03:16:12.294 --> 03:16:15.097 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENTS ARE DONE ALL THE

03:16:13.729 --> 03:16:16.765 region:rollup2
TIME.

03:16:15.097 --> 03:16:18.200 region:rollup2
ADDING THIS END TO WHAT IS

03:16:16.765 --> 03:16:19.835 region:rollup2
ALREADY DONE WITH THE

03:16:18.200 --> 03:16:20.402 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE CONNECTION.

03:16:19.835 --> 03:16:22.971 region:rollup2
TO THOSE SERVICES THAT KIDS

03:16:20.402 --> 03:16:27.075 region:rollup2
NEED.

03:16:22.971 --> 03:16:28.510 region:rollup2
WOULD BE A GOOD PATH TO PURSUE.

03:16:27.075 --> 03:16:29.077 region:rollup2
JUST WANT TO ADD ONE THING IN

03:16:28.510 --> 03:16:30.012 region:rollup2
LIGHT OF ALL THE REALLY GOOD

03:16:29.077 --> 03:16:31.880 region:rollup2
COMMENTS

03:16:30.012 --> 03:16:32.948 region:rollup2
SO DOCTOR NADINE BURKE OPEN AND

INVERSES OUT. ONE OF THE THINGS

03:17:24.099 --> 03:17:26.535 region:rollup2
WE DON'T TALK A LOT ABOUT WHAT

03:17:25.567 --> 03:17:28.470 region:rollup2

PRACTICE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

03:17:41.049 --> 03:17:43.552 region:rollup2
ALLEGATION. BECAUSE IT WAS SO

WERE AND HE WAS WEARING THE SAME

03:17:58.533 --> 03:18:01.470 region:rollup2
CLOTHES FOR TWO WEEKS IN A ROW.

03:18:00.235 --> 03:18:02.971 region:rollup2
WHO DIDN'T HAVE FOOD TO EAT?

03:18:01.470 --> 03:18:04.106 region:rollup2
WASN'T SLEEPING WHO WAS UP AT

03:18:02.971 --> 03:18:05.273 region:rollup2
THREE IN THE MORNING BECAUSE

03:18:04.106 --> 03:18:06.842 region:rollup2
THERE IS A FAMILY TRANSFER AT

03:18:05.273 --> 03:18:08.276 region:rollup2
NIGHT THOSE TYPES OF THINGS I

03:18:06.842 --> 03:18:10.479 region:rollup2
KNEW THAT I WOULD HAVE A VERY.

03:18:08.276 --> 03:18:12.147 region:rollup2
HARD TIME BEING RESILIENT IN MY

03:18:10.479 --> 03:18:13.648 region:rollup2
JOB AND THEN GIVING A HUNDRED

03:18:12.147 --> 03:18:14.950 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF MY CARE.

03:18:13.648 --> 03:18:16.685 region:rollup2
TO ALL THE KIDS I HAVE TO DEAL

03:18:14.950 --> 03:18:18.453 region:rollup2
WITH EVERYDAY AND BY HAVING THAT

03:18:16.685 --> 03:18:19.588 region:rollup2
LOCUSTS IN THE SCHOOL THAT

03:18:18.453 --> 03:18:21.089 region:rollup2
TROMBONE FROM PRACTICE IN THE

03:18:19.588 --> 03:18:22.190 region:rollup2
SCHOOL YOU'RE ALSO BUILDING

03:18:21.089 --> 03:18:23.358 region:rollup2
RESILIENCY WITH YOUR TEACHING

03:18:22.190 --> 03:18:24.326 region:rollup2
FORCE. AND THAT MEANS YOU'RE

03:18:23.358 --> 03:18:25.127 region:rollup2
GONNA HAVE BETTER TEACHER

03:18:24.326 --> 03:18:26.428 region:rollup2
PRODUCT AS THEY'RE GOING TO GET

03:18:25.127 --> 03:18:27.462 region:rollup2
THE HEALTH CARE TO IT'S NOT JUST

03:18:26.428 --> 03:18:28.663 region:rollup2
ABOUT KIDS IT'S ABOUT THE

03:18:27.462 --> 03:18:30.031 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THAT COMMUNITY

03:18:28.663 --> 03:18:31.566 region:rollup2
ASPECT. THEY NEED THAT TOO AND

03:18:30.031 --> 03:18:36.671 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S WHY I THINK IT

03:18:31.566 --> 03:18:38.407 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE IN THE SCHOOL.

03:18:36.671 --> 03:18:40.509 region:rollup2
SO I WANTED TO END WITH ONE

03:18:38.407 --> 03:18:42.110 region:rollup2
COMMENT AND THEN WE WILL TAKE

03:18:40.509 --> 03:18:44.379 region:rollup2
PUBLIC COMMENT IF I COULD.

03:18:42.110 --> 03:18:46.782 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I. WAS INTERESTED WHEN

03:18:44.379 --> 03:18:49.684 region:rollup2
YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW INFANT

03:18:46.782 --> 03:18:51.486 region:rollup2
MORTALITY IS A METRIC THAT WE DO

03:18:49.684 --> 03:18:52.921 region:rollup2
FOLLOW. AND EARLIER WE HEARD

03:18:51.486 --> 03:18:54.456 region:rollup2
FROM DOCTOR THOMPSON WHO TALKED

03:18:52.921 --> 03:18:55.490 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE CANARY IN THE COAL

03:18:54.456 --> 03:18:56.425 region:rollup2
MINE.

03:18:55.490 --> 03:18:59.060 region:rollup2
AND OFTENTIMES I LOOK AT OUR

03:18:56.425 --> 03:19:00.295 region:rollup2
INFANT MORTALITY AND. LOOK AT

03:18:59.060 --> 03:19:02.330 region:rollup2
THE TRAUMA THAT HAPPENS TO TOO

03:19:00.295 --> 03:19:04.599 region:rollup2
MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND

03:19:02.330 --> 03:19:06.601 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.

03:19:04.599 --> 03:19:08.470 region:rollup2
WE MUST BE HONEST ABOUT IT.

03:19:06.601 --> 03:19:09.638 region:rollup2
AND I WANTED TO. TALK ABOUT A

03:19:08.470 --> 03:19:12.040 region:rollup2
FEW SOLUTIONS THAT ACTUALLY

03:19:09.638 --> 03:19:12.674 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE ME BECAUSE OFTENTIMES

03:19:12.040 --> 03:19:13.642 region:rollup2
YOU CAN HEAR PRESENTATIONS LIKE

03:19:12.674 --> 03:19:14.209 region:rollup2
THIS.

03:19:13.642 --> 03:19:16.344 region:rollup2
AND.

03:19:14.209 --> 03:19:17.979 region:rollup2
THEY CAN GET YOU DOWN ABOUT THE

03:19:16.344 --> 03:19:19.514 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT FACE OUR

03:19:17.979 --> 03:19:21.483 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES BUT THERE ARE REAL

03:19:19.514 --> 03:19:23.485 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES HERE. AND ONE OF

03:19:21.483 --> 03:19:25.821 region:rollup2

GREATEST NEEDS

COMMUNITIES AND. SOME POTENTIAL

03:19:51.446 --> 03:19:54.950 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS BUT I WANTED TO

03:19:53.348 --> 03:19:56.585 region:rollup2
HIGHLIGHT IF I COULD WHAT I DO

03:19:54.950 --> 03:19:58.854 region:rollup2
THINK IS A POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY

03:19:56.585 --> 03:20:00.255 region:rollup2
AN OVERLAP BETWEEN EDUCATION.

03:19:58.854 --> 03:20:01.423 region:rollup2
WHICH IS SOCIAL EMOTIONAL

03:20:00.255 --> 03:20:03.391 region:rollup2
LEARNING.

03:20:01.423 --> 03:20:05.260 region:rollup2
THIS IDEA THAT YOU HAVE A.

03:20:03.391 --> 03:20:07.095 region:rollup2
ADULT

03:20:05.260 --> 03:20:08.463 region:rollup2
CARING REPRESENTATIVE AT A

THAT. AMOUNT OF NURTURING AND

03:20:12.033 --> 03:20:15.170 region:rollup2
SAFETY.

03:20:13.001 --> 03:20:17.138 region:rollup2
AND.

03:20:15.170 --> 03:20:20.041 region:rollup2
YEAH I'M REMINDED OF WHAT OPRAH

03:20:17.138 --> 03:20:20.675 region:rollup2
SAID AND SINCE SHE'S NOW GOING

03:20:20.041 --> 03:20:21.209 region:rollup2
ON SIXTY MINUTES TALKING ABOUT A

03:20:20.675 --> 03:20:24.045 region:rollup2
SAYS A.

03:20:21.209 --> 03:20:25.514 region:rollup2
PROBABLY TRUE BUT SHE SAID THAT.

03:20:24.045 --> 03:20:27.582 region:rollup2
AT A SCHOOL IS WHERE SHE FOUND

03:20:25.514 --> 03:20:28.617 region:rollup2
AND FELT SAFE.

03:20:27.582 --> 03:20:29.985 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WAS AN ADULT WHO

03:20:28.617 --> 03:20:31.953 region:rollup2
CARED ABOUT HER AND.

03:20:29.985 --> 03:20:33.822 region:rollup2
IS THAT A MODEL THAT WE SHOULD

03:20:31.953 --> 03:20:35.090 region:rollup2

IN THE SAN FRANCISCO SINCE TWO

03:24:44.272 --> 03:24:46.908 region:rollup2
THOUSAND EIGHT NINE WE'VE BEEN

03:24:45.473 --> 03:24:47.542 region:rollup2

03:24:46.908 --> 03:24:49.477 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS IN.

03:24:47.542 --> 03:24:51.412 region:rollup2
IN THE DISTRICT AND.

03:24:49.477 --> 03:24:52.947 region:rollup2
I JUST WANNA SAY THAT WE HAD

03:24:51.412 --> 03:24:54.816 region:rollup2
REALLY GREAT IDEAS AND LOTS OF

03:24:52.947 --> 03:24:55.783 region:rollup2
WONDERFUL COMMENTARY AND I KEEP

03:24:54.816 --> 03:24:57.585 region:rollup2
HEARING PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT

03:24:55.783 --> 03:24:59.320 region:rollup2
MORE SERVICES RESOURCES LIKE

03:24:57.585 --> 03:25:00.421 region:rollup2
THERAPY. AND I THINK THAT

03:24:59.320 --> 03:25:02.257 region:rollup2
THEY'RE JUST WE DON'T HAVE

03:25:00.421 --> 03:25:02.824 region:rollup2
ENOUGH PEOPLE TO ACTUALLY DO

03:25:02.257 --> 03:25:03.725 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK IS A GREAT IDEA

03:25:02.824 --> 03:25:04.826 region:rollup2
AND.

03:25:03.725 --> 03:25:06.494 region:rollup2
AND I ALSO THINK YOU KNOW IN

03:25:04.826 --> 03:25:07.428 region:rollup2
YOUR EXAMPLE ABOUT FIVE KIDS IN

03:25:06.494 --> 03:25:08.963 region:rollup2
EVERY CLASSROOM THAT HAVE HAD

03:25:07.428 --> 03:25:10.131 region:rollup2
FIVE OR MORE ACES THAT DOESN'T

03:25:08.963 --> 03:25:11.766 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THOSE

03:25:10.131 --> 03:25:12.767 region:rollup2
CHILDREN ONLY NEED THERAPY. ARE

03:25:11.766 --> 03:25:14.235 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE YOU HAD THEM IF

03:25:12.767 --> 03:25:16.004 region:rollup2
YOU'VE HAD RESILIENT FACTORS IN

03:25:14.235 --> 03:25:17.372 region:rollup2
YOUR LIFE YOU MAY NOT JUST LIKE

03:25:16.004 --> 03:25:18.339 region:rollup2
MAYA ANGELOU WHO HAD ALL THOSE.

03:25:17.372 --> 03:25:19.507 region:rollup2
THINGS HAPPEN TO HER RIGHT BUT

03:25:18.339 --> 03:25:20.909 region:rollup2
SHE WAS RESILIENT SHE HAD

03:25:19.507 --> 03:25:23.211 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO CARED ABOUT HER.

03:25:20.909 --> 03:25:25.213 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A

03:25:23.211 --> 03:25:25.713 region:rollup2
WHOLE SCHOOL CHANGE WE'RE NOT

03:25:25.213 --> 03:25:28.249 region:rollup2

PROVIDING THERAPY AT TO EVERYONE

03:25:28.249 --> 03:25:30.485 region:rollup2
IN THE SCHOOL WE'RE TALKING

03:25:29.083 --> 03:25:32.120 region:rollup2
ABOUT CHANGING THE COMMUNITY SO

03:25:30.485 --> 03:25:33.454 region:rollup2
THAT COMMUNITY ENHANCES

03:25:32.120 --> 03:25:34.856 region:rollup2
RESILIENCE FACTORS FOR EVERYBODY

03:25:33.454 --> 03:25:37.091 region:rollup2
TEACHERS AS HE WAS AS A JOHN WAS

03:25:34.856 --> 03:25:40.028 region:rollup2
SAYING. AND ALSO FOR STUDENTS SO

03:25:37.091 --> 03:25:41.863 region:rollup2
THAT. IF YOU HAD SOME FIVE KIDS

03:25:40.028 --> 03:25:45.567 region:rollup2
IN IN THE FOR CLASSROOMS THAT IT

03:25:41.863 --> 03:25:47.101 region:rollup2
HAD TRAUMA THEY BE EXPERIENCING.

03:25:45.567 --> 03:25:48.503 region:rollup2
BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ALL DAY LONG
