IF YOU'RE NOT ON TENURE TRACK

YOU TEND NOT TO BE A FULL TIME --

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.112
IN A FULL TIME FACULTY POSITION

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:07.447
FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE A LECTURER

00:04:07.513 --> 00:04:08.881

POSITIONS.

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:12.685
AND THE REASON I AM SUPPORTIVE

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.587
OF EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF FULL

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:16.422

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.957
THESE CATEGORIES ARE OF TENURE

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:19.125
TRACK.

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:22.228
IS HAVING -- TAUGHT AT VARIOUS

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:24.797
UC'S OVER THE YEARS PRIMARILY AS

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:27.667
A PART TIME EITHER LECTURE OTHER

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:28.668
CATEGORY.

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:29.902
I DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICE.

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:31.871
I COULD NOT HAVE OFFICE HOURS

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:32.705
BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAVE AN

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:35.108
OFFICE AND SINCE I WAS ONLY PART

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:37.310
TIME I HAD OTHER JOBS SO MY

00:04:37.377 --> 00:04:39.512
ABILITY TO SPEND TIME WITH ANY

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:42.048
OF MY STUDENTS OUTSIDE OF CLASS.

00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.250
WAS PRETTY RESTRICTED AND AS WE

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:46.219
KNOW STUDENT SUCCESS IS OFTEN

00:04:46.285 --> 00:04:48.121
DEPENDENT ON THEIR ABILITY TO

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:48.888
INTERACT.

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.190
WITH THEIR INSTRUCTOR OR IF IT'S

00:04:51.257 --> 00:04:53.826
A LARGE ENOUGH CLASS THERE TA SO --

00:04:53.893 --> 00:04:54.961
BOTH IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:04:55.028 --> 00:04:57.397
SYSTEM AND OUR UC AND CSU SYSTEM

00:04:57.463 --> 00:04:59.432
I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF OUR

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:01.601
MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE AS MANY

00:05:01.668 --> 00:05:04.704
FULL TIME FACULTY AS POSSIBLE.

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:06.439
BUT TO OUR RESERVATION LOOK AND

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:08.541
I GUESS I SHOULD SAY SOMETHING

00:05:08.608 --> 00:05:10.410
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO OUT ON

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:12.278
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME WORK DONE

00:05:12.345 --> 00:05:14.113
ON ON TEN YEAR CONTINUE TRACK

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.048
THE PROBLEM I THINK WITH MOST

00:05:15.114 --> 00:05:16.516
FOLKS IS THEY MISUNDERSTAND WHAT

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:17.784
TENURE AREAS IN TEN YEARS NO

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:18.618
MORE THAN.

00:05:18.685 --> 00:05:20.486
SAYING YOUR PERMIT FACULTY WITH

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:22.388
CERTAIN RIGHTS NOW IS ONCE YOU

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:23.556
ACQUIRE TENURE IT'S NOT A

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:25.458
PERMANENT THING I'VE KNOWN FOLKS

00:05:25.525 --> 00:05:26.893
WHO'VE BEEN FIRED WHO IT TENURE.

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:28.494
OF LORD NOT DOING THEIRJOB AND

00:05:28.561 --> 00:05:29.696
NOT PERFORMING AT A LEVEL THEY

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:30.863
SHOULD BE A DISMISS THIS

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.565
REGARDING STUDENTS SO IT'S NOT

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:33.399
SOMETHING THAT SAYS YOU CAN

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:34.567
NEVER BE FIRED AGAIN.

00:05:34.634 --> 00:05:35.568
BUT IT SAYS THAT IF THEY'RE

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:37.437
GOING TO DO ANY ACTION ON YOU

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:38.838
YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST DO HAVE DUE

00:05:38.905 --> 00:05:40.306
PROCESS AFTER YEARS OF WORKING

00:05:40.373 --> 00:05:40.840
THERE.

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:42.508
HAVE TO NOTIFY YOU THAT TO TRY

00:05:42.575 --> 00:05:43.810
TO REMEDIATE WHAT'S GOING ON

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:45.011
THAT THAT KIND OF STUFF AND SO

00:05:45.078 --> 00:05:46.646
AS A RESULT IT IS NOT A

00:05:46.713 --> 00:05:47.980
PERMANENT JOB THING BUT IT'S

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:48.214
ABOUT.

00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:49.982
STATUS AS THE ONE OF THINGS THAT

00:05:50.049 --> 00:05:51.851
DID HAPPEN AND AND AND I WENT TO

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:52.518
THE HEARING I'M TRYING TO

00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:54.020
REMEMBER WHAT COMMITTEE DID I

00:05:54.087 --> 00:05:55.621
THINK IT WAS HIGHER IT AND IT

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:56.656
HAD A COMMITTEE.

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:57.890
I HAD A MEETING AT SAN JOSE A

00:05:57.957 --> 00:06:00.793
FEW YEARS BACK CONCERNING ALL

00:06:03.296 --> 00:06:04.697
HELP TO STUDENT SUCCESS.

00:06:04.764 --> 00:06:10.369

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:11.938
DIVERSITY OF FACULTY.

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:12.839
THAT STUDENTS IF THEY HAVE

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:13.873
FACULTY THAT LOOK LIKE THEM THAT

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:14.741
HAVE BASICALLY UNDERSTAND THEIR

00:06:14.807 --> 00:06:15.808
AGENDA AND WHAT'S GOING ON THEY

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:16.342
HAVE A GREATER SENSE OF OF

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:17.276
SURVIVING AND REMAINING IN THAT

00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:18.644
INSTITUTION SO THAT.

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.146
SO THAT WAS REAL CLEAR VERY

00:06:20.213 --> 00:06:21.714
STRONG AMONG COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:06:21.781 --> 00:06:23.049
WELL AS OTHERS.

00:06:23.116 --> 00:06:24.250
IT ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE FACT

00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:26.719
THAT A PART OF BEING FACULTY IS

00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:27.253
MENTORING AND SUPPORTING

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.654

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:54.614
I WAS WE HAD OFFICE HOURS YOU

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.214
COULD HELP TO THOSE KIND OF

00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:55.748
THINGS.

00:06:55.815 --> 00:06:57.483
AND THAT'S CRITICAL IN TERMS OF

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.752
STUDENT SUCCESS -- ALSO WHAT'S

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:01.354
EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.257
INSTITUTIONS SUPPOSEDLY RUN BY

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:05.224
TENURED FACULTY.

00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:06.325
THE WHOLE ISSUE OF FACULTY

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:17.336
SENATE.

00:07:17.403 --> 00:07:19.071
SO WE WERE BASICALLY THE WHOLE

00:07:19.138 --> 00:07:21.240
IDEA OF COLLEGIALITY AND RUNNING

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:22.809

HANDS OF THE TENURED FACULTY --

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:25.444
SO THAT'S A PART OF THEIR

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:27.280
WORKFLOW TO BASICALLY HELP RUN

00:07:27.346 --> 00:07:28.848

OBVIOUSLY MISUSED.

00:07:32.852 --> 00:07:34.587
AND AND IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:36.289

CORRECT THOSE THINGS WHEN THEY

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:39.859
ARE WHEN THAT WHEN THAT TENURE

00:07:39.926 --> 00:07:41.294

HOUSES OPTIONS HERE -- THE FIRST --

00:08:33.112 --> 00:08:36.282
AS WE WOULD NOTE THAT -- THE

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.417
ASSEMBLY ADOPTED A GOVERNOR'S

00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:40.720

ON THE SENATE ALSO ADOPTED THE

00:08:47.393 --> 00:08:48.861

DIFFERENT APPROACHES A WHICH

00:08:58.237 --> 00:08:59.739
SEGMENT YOU'D LIKE TO DIRECT

00:08:59.805 --> 00:09:00.606
FUNDING TO AND WHEN WHETHER

00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:02.541
THERE'S A A WAY TO SORT OF A

00:09:02.608 --> 00:09:05.077
DIVIDE UP THAT FUNDING FOR

00:09:05.144 --> 00:09:06.612
EXAMPLE BASED ON ENROLLMENT.

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.614
SECONDS WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE

00:09:08.681 --> 00:09:10.082
THE PURPOSE OF THE FUNDS COULD

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:11.651
COULD DIFFER DEPENDING ON HOW

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:13.853
THE PROGRAMS INTENDED USE THEIR

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.420
EITHER ON GOING A ONE TIME

00:09:14.487 --> 00:09:15.187
FUNDING.

00:09:15.254 --> 00:09:17.223

WITHIN THEIR SYSTEM SO FOR

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:20.493
EXAMPLE.

00:09:20.559 --> 00:09:23.996
ABOUT HALF OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:26.766
DISTRICTS -- HAVE A A PROGRAM

00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:28.668
AND SO THAT THE DIGITAL FUNDING

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:29.702
FOR SEIZE COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:09:29.769 --> 00:09:31.570
COULD BE USED TO EXPAND TO MORE

00:09:31.637 --> 00:09:32.438
CAMPUSES.

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:35.808
ALTERNATIVELY IF SOME K&lt;c.cyan&gt; SOME&lt;/c&gt;

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:36.409
PROGRAMS MIGHT.

00:09:36.475 --> 00:09:37.043
TRY TO EXPAND MORE SERVICES AT

00:09:37.109 --> 00:09:38.411
THEIR EXISTING CAMPUSES AND SO

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:39.445
THAT THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT

00:09:39.512 --> 00:09:40.546
PRIORITIES AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO

00:09:40.613 --> 00:09:42.581
CONSIDER WHICH OF THOSE MIGHT BE

00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:43.215
YOUR HIGHEST PRIORITY WITH THESE

00:09:43.282 --> 00:09:44.350

THAT THE HOUSE IS DIFFERENT

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:47.453
TERMS OF ON GOING IN ONE TIME

AREA.

00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:09.588
COULD BE VERY HELPFUL.

00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:11.557
MANY INMATES HAVE HAD GREAT

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:13.225
SUCCESS [inaudible]

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:18.030
WITH THEIR PROGRAMS IN CUSTODY.

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:20.332
BUT KEEP TRACK OF WHICH IS ONE

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:22.034
OF THE GREAT DEFICIENCIES OF

00:13:22.101 --> 00:13:23.702
CORRECTIONS HISTORICALLY IN ALL

00:13:23.769 --> 00:13:25.938
PROGRAMMING.

00:13:26.005 --> 00:13:28.374
IS A FAILURE TO KEEP TRACK OF

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.775
THE SUCCESS RATES.

00:13:29.842 --> 00:13:31.243
AND JUST THROW MORE MONEY AND

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:32.978
MORE MONEY MORE MONEY.

00:13:33.045 --> 00:13:34.480
AND WE DID NOT SEE SUCCESSES

00:13:34.547 --> 00:13:37.683
HERE THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.684
BUT IT'S GOT TO BE DIRECTED

00:13:38.751 --> 00:13:40.452
TOWARD SUCCESS AND YOU'RE YOU'RE

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:42.655
DEALING WITH A POPULATION THAT'S

00:13:42.721 --> 00:13:43.923
MORE CHALLENGE MORE

00:13:43.989 --> 00:13:46.425
DISADVANTAGED GOING IN TO THE

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:47.693
COLLEGE LEVEL.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.661
REGIMENT.

00:13:48.727 --> 00:13:51.163
AND LEVELS OF WORK IS QUIET SO

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.366
WE NEED TO KEEP TRACK OF THE

00:13:54.433 --> 00:13:56.168
ROLE OF A JUST A BIT TRY TO

00:13:56.235 --> 00:13:57.102
ANSWER MY COLLEAGUES.

00:13:57.169 --> 00:13:58.504
QUESTION ON REPORTING -- IT'S

00:13:58.571 --> 00:14:01.273
NOT APPARENT FROM THE MATERIAL.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.975
IN YOUR BINDER BUT THE BUDGET

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:05.644
SUBCOMMITTEE ONE WITH RESPECT TO

00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:06.679
PROJECT REBOUND.

00:14:06.745 --> 00:14:08.681
APPROVED SOME OF REPORTING

00:14:08.747 --> 00:14:10.216
LANGUAGE FOR EXAMPLE THAT.

00:14:10.282 --> 00:14:14.620
REQUIRES REPORTING IN APRIL --

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:15.621
ONE TWENTY TWENTY THIS SAYS ON

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:16.722
THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS FUNDING

00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:18.157
SOURCES AND TYPES OF PROGRAMS AT

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:19.525
C. ISSUE CAMPUS IS USED TO

00:14:19.592 --> 00:14:21.060
SUPPORT FORMERLY INCARCERATED

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:22.795
STUDENTS.

00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:24.496
NEXT HOW THE CAMPUS PROGRAMS

00:14:24.563 --> 00:14:25.864
COORDINATE WITH OTHER SUPPORT

00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:27.399
SERVICES IN THE VERY STATEWIDE

00:14:27.466 --> 00:14:29.068
AND LOCAL INITIATIVES FOR

00:14:29.134 --> 00:14:30.669
FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE.

00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:33.239
AND THE OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH

00:14:33.305 --> 00:14:34.773
THIS FUNDING SO THAT REPORTING

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:36.208
LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT IS ON THE

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:37.376
SENATE SIDE.

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:40.045
WITH RESPECT TO PROJECT

00:14:40.112 --> 00:14:45.251
REDUNDANCY ISSUE.

00:14:45.317 --> 00:14:46.218
MADAM CHAIR IF I MAY.

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:46.819
I JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE

00:14:46.885 --> 00:14:48.020
ADMINISTRATION HAS NO CONCERNS

00:14:48.087 --> 00:14:49.054
WITH THE SENATE'S PROPOSED

00:14:49.121 --> 00:14:50.122
REPORTING LANGUAGE FOR PROJECT

00:14:50.189 --> 00:14:54.460
RENOWNED.

00:14:54.526 --> 00:14:56.695
THANK YOU WITH SKINNER.

00:14:56.762 --> 00:14:59.298
THANK YOU --THIS.

00:14:59.365 --> 00:15:00.966
IS CLEARLY MONEY THAT IS WE'RE

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:02.501
DEALING WITH THIS IN EDUCATION

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.603
BECAUSE IT'S EDUCATION MONEY

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:09.208
THOUGH THE IN OUR PUBLIC SAFETY --

00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:10.943
BUDGET SUB FIVE WE'VE HAD A

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.512
NUMBER OF HEARINGS ON BOTH THE

00:15:13.579 --> 00:15:15.414
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS WITHIN

00:15:15.481 --> 00:15:17.182
OUR STATE PRISONS AND THE

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:18.784
REENTRY PROGRAMS.

00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:20.686
AND WE ARE NOW AT THE PIECES IN

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:22.521
THE SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE

00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:24.957
PRESENCE BY RCS USE OUR

00:15:25.024 --> 00:15:26.292
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND A NUMBER

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:27.426
OF UC'S.

00:15:27.493 --> 00:15:29.862
IN MANY MANY OF OUR STATE

00:15:29.928 --> 00:15:31.130
PRISONS.

00:15:31.196 --> 00:15:33.465
AND THE FACT THAT ARE DIFFERENT

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:35.601
HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS

00:15:35.668 --> 00:15:38.804
ARE OFFERING COURSE WORK AT THE

00:15:38.871 --> 00:15:39.972
PRISON LEVEL.

00:15:40.039 --> 00:15:43.342
THEN HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:46.412
PEOPLE WHEN THEY LEAVE PRISON TO

00:15:46.478 --> 00:15:48.781
ENTER THOSE FACILITIES.

00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:51.650
AND WHAT AS HAS BEEN SORT OF

00:15:51.717 --> 00:15:54.453
NOTED OF COURSE SUCH A STUDENT

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.255
DOES NEED SOME MORE SUPPORT THAN

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:57.389
OTHER STUDENTS.

00:15:57.456 --> 00:16:01.293
AND THESE PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE --

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.362
THE CSU PROGRAM -- PROJECT

00:16:03.429 --> 00:16:05.798
RENOWNED WAS STARTED I BELIEVE

00:16:05.864 --> 00:16:08.167
IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE AND IT

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:09.768
WAS PRIMARILY AT SAN FRANCISCO

00:16:09.835 --> 00:16:12.338
STATE UNTIL RECENTLY BUT NOW AS

00:16:12.404 --> 00:16:14.373
DIFFERENT CSU CAMPUSES HAVE

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.542
EXPANDED IN THE STATE PRISONS IT

00:16:16.608 --> 00:16:21.947
MAKES THAT MUCH MORE SENSE --

00:16:22.014 --> 00:16:22.681
FOR PROGRAMS LIKE PROJECT

00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:26.518
REBOUND TO ALSO EXPAND AT THE AT

00:16:26.585 --> 00:16:28.120
THEIR OWN STATE FACILITIES.

00:16:28.187 --> 00:16:30.689
SO I I WOULD ANTICIPATE NO I

00:16:30.756 --> 00:16:32.524
HOPE THAT WHAT PROJECT REBOUND

00:16:32.591 --> 00:16:34.760
HAS IN MIND IS TO DO SOMETHING

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:37.029
SIMILAR AS TO WHAT HAPPENED WITH

00:16:37.096 --> 00:16:38.230
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM

00:16:38.297 --> 00:16:40.432
WHEN IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WHEN

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:42.034
WE APPROVED THE FUNDING FOR THE

00:16:42.101 --> 00:16:43.635
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM.

00:16:43.702 --> 00:16:45.537
THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OPENED

00:16:45.604 --> 00:16:47.106
UP A GRANT PROGRAM AND THE

00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:48.741
DIFFERENT COMMITTEE COLLEGE

00:16:48.807 --> 00:16:51.310
CAMPUSES THAT HAD EITHER STRONG

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:53.846
PRESENCE IN THE PRISONS. FOR A

00:16:53.912 --> 00:16:56.215
GOOD NUMBER OF RE ENTRY FOLKS

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:58.550
ALREADY ENROLLED THEN APPLIED

00:16:58.617 --> 00:17:02.354
FOR FUNDING TO BE ABLE -- TO IN

00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:03.589
OKAY AB MAKE THEIR SUPPORT.

00:17:03.655 --> 00:17:06.525
SERVICES ROBUST AND SO I NOTE

00:17:06.592 --> 00:17:08.227
THE CHEERS POINT THAT THERE'S

00:17:08.293 --> 00:17:10.229
FEWER CS USE THAN WE'D

00:17:10.295 --> 00:17:13.232
POTENTIALLY HOPE BUT I WOULD --

00:17:13.298 --> 00:17:15.801
ANTICIPATE THAT WITH THIS IF WE

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:16.835
WERE TO APPROVE.

00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:18.737
THE FUNDS THAT WE WOULD SEE AN

00:17:18.804 --> 00:17:21.473
EXPANSION OF CSU CAMPUSES THAT

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.409
PARTICIPATED IN THE PROJECT

00:17:23.475 --> 00:17:25.811
REBOUND -- PROGRAM NO IN THE UC

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:26.979
SYSTEM.

00:17:27.045 --> 00:17:28.480
THE UNDERGROUND SCHOLARS WE

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:30.182
STARTED AT UC BERKELEY AND THAT

00:17:30.249 --> 00:17:32.651
PROGRAM NOT ONLY SUPPORTS THE

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:34.686
STUDENTS WHO ARE REENTRY

00:17:34.753 --> 00:17:40.459
STUDENTS AT UC BUT ALSO SUPPORTS.

00:17:40.526 --> 00:17:40.826
THE X..

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:42.428
THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH PROGRAMS

00:17:42.494 --> 00:17:44.062
AT BOTH CSU CAMPUSES AND OTHER

00:17:44.129 --> 00:17:47.733
UC'S. FIVE THERE ARE FEWER OF

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.334
OUR FORMALLY INCARCERATED WHO

00:17:49.401 --> 00:17:51.303
ARE ATTENDING THE UC SYSTEM BUT

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:53.105
INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH A NUMBER OF

00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:54.373
THEM HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.074
SUCCESSFUL AND MANY ARE NOW IN

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:58.010
PHD PROGRAMS.

00:17:58.076 --> 00:18:00.412
SO I CERTAINLY CAN -- ASK

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:02.481
PROJECT -- RATHER UNDERGROUND

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:03.949
SCHOLARS TO GIVE US SOME NUMBERS

00:18:04.016 --> 00:18:07.019
ON THE SUCCESS SO FAR.

00:18:07.085 --> 00:18:09.588
BUT OF WITH THE DIFF SMALL

00:18:09.655 --> 00:18:11.523
NUMBER THAT HAVE BEEN AT THE UC

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.059
SYSTEM THAT THE INTERACTIONS

00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:15.060
I'VE SEEN IN REPORTS I'VE SEEN

00:18:15.127 --> 00:18:16.728
THAT THE SUCCESS RATE IS QUITE

00:18:16.795 --> 00:18:17.629
HIGH.

00:18:17.696 --> 00:18:19.898
BUT I THINK THIS -- THIS

00:18:19.965 --> 00:18:22.167
RELATIVELY MODEST EXPENDITURE IN

00:18:22.234 --> 00:18:24.470
THESE THREE SYSTEMS VERY MUCH

00:18:24.536 --> 00:18:25.471
COMPLIMENTS.

00:18:25.537 --> 00:18:26.805
THE BOTH THE EXPANDED

00:18:26.872 --> 00:18:28.240
REHABILITATION THAT WE'RE DOING

00:18:28.307 --> 00:18:29.675
WITHIN OUR STATE PRISON

00:18:29.741 --> 00:18:32.044
FACILITIES AND OUR FOCUS ON

00:18:32.110 --> 00:18:35.647
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

00:18:35.714 --> 00:18:36.849
SUCCESSFUL REENTRY.

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:37.983
THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:38.317
MISS MCCARTY.

00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:39.284
YEAH THANK YOU YOU KNOW

00:18:39.351 --> 00:18:41.019
CERTAINLY WITH ALL THAT PROGRAMS

00:18:41.086 --> 00:18:42.588
AND EFFORTS FOR DOING CHANGING

00:18:42.654 --> 00:18:43.956
OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WE

00:18:44.022 --> 00:18:47.125
NEED MORE FOCUS ON RE ENTRY --

00:18:47.192 --> 00:18:49.461
THAT'S WHY ALL THESE PROGRAMS

00:18:49.528 --> 00:18:50.696
ARE ARE WORTHY AND I WILL KNOW

00:18:50.762 --> 00:18:52.831
THAT THEY'RE ALL PRUDENT AND I

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:54.066
THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT WITH THAT.

00:18:54.132 --> 00:18:55.367
UC BERKELEY SCHOLARS BUT

00:18:55.434 --> 00:18:56.735
SPECIFICALLY PROJECT RIBBON AT I

00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:58.103
WILL NOTE WITH WITH A LOT OF

00:18:58.170 --> 00:18:58.670
TIME THAT HAPPENS IS

00:18:58.737 --> 00:19:01.139
PHILANTHROPY STARTS A PROGRAM.

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:03.108
AND SEE IF IT WORKS AND THEN THE

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:03.876
DENTIST THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE

00:19:03.942 --> 00:19:05.410
THERE FOREVER ITSELF IT'S A

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:07.346
WORTHY PROGRAM TURN OVER TO THE

00:19:07.412 --> 00:19:09.114
GOVERNMENT TAKE WE TRY THIS IT'S

00:19:09.181 --> 00:19:09.915
PROVEN.

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:11.750
AND THAT THE MILLION THAT'S IN

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.151
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:14.686
WOULDN'T FIND PROJECT READ ON

00:19:14.753 --> 00:19:16.522
THEY HAVE TO CUT BACK AT SOME OF

00:19:16.588 --> 00:19:18.056
THOSE EIGHT CAMPUSES AND SO THIS

00:19:18.123 --> 00:19:18.657
TO SEE.

00:19:18.724 --> 00:19:21.093
THE ASSEMBLY ACTION WITH THE

00:19:21.159 --> 00:19:22.661
THREE POINT THREE ONGOING KEEPS

00:19:22.728 --> 00:19:24.796
THEM WHERE THEY'RE AT TODAY.

00:19:24.863 --> 00:19:25.764
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.933
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IT

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.801
THAT THE ONE MILLION I WOULD

00:19:29.868 --> 00:19:31.203
HAVE THAT HAVE TO CUT SOME OF

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.539
THOSE THE CAMPUSES AND CERTAINLY

00:19:33.605 --> 00:19:34.973
WOULD LIKE TO GROW TO OTHER.

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.175
ISSUES BUT AGAIN THIS ACTION

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:42.114
JUST ONLY ALLOWS A DATE TO KEEP

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:42.514
BROTHER AT TODAY.

00:19:42.581 --> 00:19:43.081
THANK YOU.

00:19:43.148 --> 00:19:44.917
THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS

00:19:44.983 --> 00:19:45.484
OR COMMENTS.

00:19:45.551 --> 00:19:46.752
WILL HOLD THAT ITEM OPEN MOVING

00:19:46.818 --> 00:19:49.054
ON TO ISSUE THIRTY SIX STILL NOT

00:19:49.121 --> 00:19:49.254
REACH.

00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:50.556
ELIA.

00:19:50.622 --> 00:19:51.423
THE ISSUE BEFORE YOU HERE ARE A

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:53.458
SERIES OF ACTIONS TAKEN.

00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:55.093
BY THE GOVERNOR GOVERNOR IN EACH

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.495
OF THE HOUSES REGARDING --

00:19:56.562 --> 00:19:57.029
HIGHER EDUCATION OUTREACH

00:19:57.095 --> 00:19:58.163
PROGRAMS.

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.698
THESE PROGRAMS AT A HIGH LEVEL

00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:01.667
OF PROVIDE SERVICES TO K. TWELVE

00:20:01.733 --> 00:20:03.035
STUDENTS WITH THE OVER ARCHING

00:20:03.101 --> 00:20:05.470
OBJECTIVE OF IMPROVING COLLEGE

00:20:05.537 --> 00:20:07.205

WHY NOT INVEST IN THE CURRENT

00:26:34.993 --> 00:26:37.195
PROGRAM INDOORS IF YOU KNOW WHAT

00:26:37.262 --> 00:26:38.596
THE COMPROMISE OF ONE OR?

00:26:38.663 --> 00:26:42.567
TWO WHEN I GET RID OF IT.

00:26:42.634 --> 00:26:43.635
WHY HAVE A WHOLE NEW?

00:26:43.702 --> 00:26:44.135
PROGRAM WHEN YOU HAVE AN

00:26:44.202 --> 00:26:44.769
EXISTING PROGRAM THAT'S CHARGED

00:26:44.836 --> 00:26:47.872
WITH DOING THIS.

00:26:47.939 --> 00:26:49.374
WE DEFINITELY RECOGNIZE THE

00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:52.110
VALUE IN THE CAL SO PROGRAM IN

00:26:52.177 --> 00:26:53.511
THE EXISTING SORT OF CONSORTIUM

00:26:53.578 --> 00:26:55.613
BASED PROGRAMMING EFFORTS THAT

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.915
THAT PROGRAM PROVIDES.

00:26:56.982 --> 00:26:58.883
HOWEVER THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:00.885
IS MORE TARGETED TO SPECIFICALLY

00:27:00.952 --> 00:27:03.688
TO THE SAN JOAQUIN IN INLAND

00:27:03.755 --> 00:27:05.357
EMPIRE REGIONS OF THE STATE.

00:27:05.423 --> 00:27:06.024
BECAUSE WE HAD IDENTIFIED THOSE

00:27:06.091 --> 00:27:07.859
AS AREAS THAT PARTICULARLY

00:27:07.926 --> 00:27:08.326
NEEDED SOME ADDITIONAL

00:27:08.393 --> 00:27:10.562
INVESTMENT.

00:27:10.628 --> 00:27:11.830
AND I WOULD I WOULD JUST ADD

00:27:11.896 --> 00:27:12.797
THAT ON THE INNOVATION GRANT

00:27:12.864 --> 00:27:14.799
CITED ISN'T JUST FOCUSED ON OUT

00:27:14.866 --> 00:27:16.234
REACH THAT'S INNOVATIVE

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:18.136
STRATEGIES TO HELP WITH STUDENT

00:27:18.203 --> 00:27:19.571
SUCCESS WITH CREATING.

00:27:19.637 --> 00:27:20.872
COLLEGE GOING CULTURES WITH

00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:23.141
FOCUSING ON THIS TWO GENERATIONS

00:27:23.208 --> 00:27:24.809
STRATEGY -- THAT THE

00:27:24.876 --> 00:27:25.977
ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT FORWARD

00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:27.712
WHICH IS HOW CAN WE HELP THE

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:29.681
STUDENTS OF TODAY AND ALSO HELP

00:27:29.748 --> 00:27:31.649
THE STUDENTS OF TOMORROW THAT

00:27:31.716 --> 00:27:33.785
ARE THEIR CHILDREN.

00:27:33.852 --> 00:27:35.120
AND AND AND THAT'S GREAT BUT I

00:27:35.186 --> 00:27:37.622
GUESS WHY NOT JUST PASSED THE

00:27:37.689 --> 00:27:39.524
EXISTING.

00:27:39.591 --> 00:27:41.860
PROGRAM TO GO DO THAT THEN.

00:27:41.926 --> 00:27:42.961
SET UP A WHOLE NEW STRIPPER SAYS

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:44.262
THAT THE HOME TO STRUCTURE AND

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:45.597
FRAMEWORK TO DO IT WHEN WE DON'T

00:27:45.663 --> 00:27:47.699
KNOW IF IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE

00:27:47.766 --> 00:27:49.401
SUCCESSFUL.

00:27:49.467 --> 00:27:51.569
SHOULD I I WOULD GO BACK.

00:27:51.636 --> 00:27:54.339
TO THE CURRENT KELSO PROGRAM IS

00:27:54.406 --> 00:27:56.007
FOCUSED ON STUDENT OUTREACH

00:27:56.074 --> 00:27:57.842
WEARS A THINK WERE WERE FOCUSED

00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:59.377
ON A MORE BROAD STRATEGY THAT

00:27:59.444 --> 00:28:00.712
INCLUDES THIS TO GENERATION

00:28:00.779 --> 00:28:03.148
STRATEGY -- SO IT'S NOT JUST

00:28:03.214 --> 00:28:06.051
TARGETED TOWARD OUTREACH.

00:28:06.117 --> 00:28:06.985
NO UNDERSTOOD BUT THEN WHY NOT

00:28:07.052 --> 00:28:09.454
JUST ASK COUNSEL TO EXPAND THEIR

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:11.356
SCOPE BECAUSE YOU'RE ASKING.

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:12.824
PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T COME FORWARD

00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:14.392
IT.

00:28:14.459 --> 00:28:15.226
TO DO SOMETHING THEY DON'T

00:28:15.293 --> 00:28:17.162
NECESSARILY.

00:28:17.228 --> 00:28:18.063
DO OR WE DON'T KNOW.

00:28:18.129 --> 00:28:20.799
EVEN ACCESS.

00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:22.734
SO I I THINK.

00:28:22.801 --> 00:28:24.736
YOU KNOW CERTAINLY KELSO PASSAGE

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:26.571
ITS FOCUS TODAY AND I THINK --

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:28.907
WE WERE ATTEMPTING TO FOCUS ON

00:28:28.973 --> 00:28:29.474
TWO SPECIFIC REGIONS OF THE

00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:32.143
STATUS AS OPPOSED TO THOSE BROAD

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.844
FIFTEEN CONSORTIUM THAT ARE

00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:34.679
THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO WE WERE

00:28:34.746 --> 00:28:36.081
DEFINITELY MUCH MORE TARGETED IN

00:28:36.147 --> 00:28:38.450
OUR APPROACH -- BUT CERTAINLY

00:28:38.516 --> 00:28:39.851
RECOGNIZE GOD YOU KNOW WHERE

00:28:39.918 --> 00:28:40.852
YOU'RE COMING FROM.

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:43.822
THE COUNTRY JUST ASK HOUSE UP.

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:46.991
TO TARGET AS WELL.

00:28:47.058 --> 00:28:48.526
ANYTIME WE TARGET SOMETHING WE

00:28:48.593 --> 00:28:49.160
NEED TO CREATE SOMETHING NEW OR

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:51.463
COULD WE ACCESS PEOPLE WHO'VE

00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:53.064
BEEN DOING IT FOR A WHILE.

00:28:53.131 --> 00:28:54.466
TO FOCUS A LITTLE BIT.

00:28:54.532 --> 00:28:55.567
CHAU.

00:28:55.633 --> 00:28:57.102
I THINK IN MANY RESPECTS YOU

00:28:57.168 --> 00:28:58.803
HAVE YOUR KELSO PROGRAM AND WE

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.638
WOULD HAVE THIS INNOVATION GRANT

00:29:00.705 --> 00:29:02.507
PROGRAM -- ULTIMATELY THE

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:03.741
INNOVATION GRANTS ARE ALSO

00:29:03.808 --> 00:29:05.710
OPERATED BY A OUR EXISTING

00:29:05.777 --> 00:29:07.812
INSTITUTIONS AS WELL SO WE WOULD

00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:09.380
BE LOOKING AT PARTNERSHIPS WITH

00:29:09.447 --> 00:29:11.049
YOU SEE CSU.

00:29:11.116 --> 00:29:13.418
OCCUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES YOUR K.

00:29:13.485 --> 00:29:14.919
TWELVE SCHOOLS SO IT IN MANY

00:29:14.986 --> 00:29:16.421
RESPECTS WERE ALSO SUPPORTING

00:29:16.488 --> 00:29:19.157
THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE --

00:29:19.224 --> 00:29:21.860
THROUGH THIS PROGRAM.

00:29:21.926 --> 00:29:24.796
THANK YOU SENATOR A THE THING

00:29:24.863 --> 00:29:26.731
ABOUT DRUGS AND JUST WANT TO

00:29:26.798 --> 00:29:28.199
NOTE THAT WHILE I'M.

00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:30.201
AMBIVALENT WITH RESPECT TO NEW

00:29:30.268 --> 00:29:33.471
PROGRAM VERSUS KELSO BY I WOULD

00:29:33.538 --> 00:29:35.807
NOTE FOR THE RECORD THAT -- IN

00:29:35.874 --> 00:29:37.108
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OR THE

00:29:37.175 --> 00:29:40.044
INLAND EMPIRE OF WAS LEFT ON THE

00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:42.147
TRAIN STATION PLATFORM AND TRAIN

00:29:42.213 --> 00:29:43.515
PULLED OUT I DON'T SEE INLAND

00:29:43.581 --> 00:29:45.683
EMPIRE IN THE KELSO PROGRAM SO.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.252
WE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE TO MAKE

00:29:47.318 --> 00:29:48.553
SOME ADJUSTMENTS.

00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:49.954
TO IT WOULD SEEM TO ME FOR THOSE

00:29:50.021 --> 00:29:51.122
OF US WHO COME FROM THAT AREA OF

00:29:51.189 --> 00:29:52.891
FIFTH CAL SOAP IS THE FINAL

00:29:52.957 --> 00:29:54.926
DESTINATION FOR THIS.

00:29:54.993 --> 00:29:55.960
THIS FUNDING.

00:29:56.027 --> 00:29:57.795
THANK MANAGER THANK YOU ANY

00:29:57.862 --> 00:29:59.597
FURTHER QUESTIONS [inaudible]

00:29:59.664 --> 00:30:02.333
THIS OBERNOLTE.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.435
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I I AGREE --

00:30:04.502 --> 00:30:06.237
I THINK PART OF THE REASON FOR

00:30:06.304 --> 00:30:08.840
JUSTIFYING THIS FUNDING IS THAT.

00:30:08.907 --> 00:30:10.875
THESE ARE A COUPLE REASON THE

00:30:10.942 --> 00:30:11.910
STATE THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND.

00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:13.311
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS I THINK

00:30:13.378 --> 00:30:14.045
IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE PROCESS

00:30:14.112 --> 00:30:15.480
DIRECT OUR RESOURCES IN THAT

00:30:15.547 --> 00:30:17.382
DIRECTION SO REGARDLESS OF

00:30:17.448 --> 00:30:18.716
WHETHER OR NOT WE INSTITUTE NEW

00:30:18.783 --> 00:30:20.552
PROGRAM USE EXISTING PROGRAM I

00:30:20.618 --> 00:30:23.788
THINK IT'S ABOUT ON US TO MAKE

00:30:23.855 --> 00:30:24.355
SURE THAT THAT MONEY GOES TO

00:30:24.422 --> 00:30:25.623
WHERE IT'S MOST NEEDED.

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:28.893
THANK YOU ANY FURTHER COMMENTS.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:29.460
WILL HOLD THAT ITEM OPEN.

00:30:29.527 --> 00:30:33.798
LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE THIRTY

00:30:33.865 --> 00:30:35.066
SEVEN CAL GRANTS COMPETITIVE

00:30:35.133 --> 00:30:41.906
SUMMER AND ACCESS AWARDS ALEJO.

00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:42.540
THANK YOU THE STICKING WITH THE

00:30:42.607 --> 00:30:43.942
LA L..

00:30:44.008 --> 00:30:46.277
THIS ISSUE COVER SEVERAL ACTIONS

00:30:46.344 --> 00:30:48.012
RELATED TO THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM.

00:30:48.079 --> 00:30:49.047
BOTH HOUSES REJECTED THE

00:30:49.113 --> 00:30:50.315
GOVERNOR'S NINETY SEVEN MILLION

00:30:50.381 --> 00:30:51.449
DOLLAR PROPOSAL TO PROVIDE

00:30:51.516 --> 00:30:52.951
ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL TO STUDENTS

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:53.885
PARENTS.

00:30:53.952 --> 00:30:55.186
AND INSTEAD REDIRECTED THE FUNDS

00:30:55.253 --> 00:30:58.523
TOWARD OTHER CONTENT PRIORITIES.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.391
THE SENATE BUT MOST OF THESE

00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:02.160
FUNDS BETWEEN TWO MAJOR ACTIONS.

00:31:02.227 --> 00:31:03.494
ONE OF THOSE ACTIONS EXPAND THE

00:31:03.561 --> 00:31:04.629
NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE AWARDS

00:31:04.696 --> 00:31:05.763
WHICH ARE TYPICALLY AVAILABLE TO

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:08.032
OLDER STUDENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE

00:31:08.099 --> 00:31:09.734
FOR THE ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM.

00:31:09.801 --> 00:31:11.102
THE OTHER ACTION WOULD EXPAND

00:31:11.169 --> 00:31:13.338
THE SIZE OF THE AXIS.

00:31:13.404 --> 00:31:14.372
WHICH IS AVAILABLE TO LOWER

00:31:14.439 --> 00:31:16.007
INCOME CAL GRANT RECIPIENTS TO

00:31:16.074 --> 00:31:18.376
ASSIST WITH THE LIVING COSTS.

00:31:18.443 --> 00:31:19.911
ASSEMBLY IN CONTRAST PRIMARILY

00:31:19.978 --> 00:31:21.346
RETRACTED THE FUNDS TOWARD

00:31:21.412 --> 00:31:22.447
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF

00:31:22.513 --> 00:31:23.815
COMPETITIVE AWARDS.

00:31:23.881 --> 00:31:25.783
THE BY A LARGER AMOUNT.

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:27.118
IT ALSO DOCTORTRAILER BILL

00:31:27.185 --> 00:31:28.419
LANGUAGE THAT WOULD PRIORITIZE

00:31:28.486 --> 00:31:31.389
STUDENT PARENTS FOR THOSE AWARDS.

00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:32.624
FINALLY BOTH HOUSES A DOCTOR

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:33.825
POLICY CHANGE THAT WOULD MAKE

00:31:33.891 --> 00:31:35.460
STUDENTS ELIGIBLE FOR CAL GRANTS

00:31:35.526 --> 00:31:36.661
DURING THE SUMMER.

00:31:36.728 --> 00:31:38.263
WITHOUT THIS COMING TOWARD THE

00:31:38.329 --> 00:31:39.163
MAXIMUM TIME LIMIT FOR RECEIVING

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:40.999
AID.

00:31:41.065 --> 00:31:42.567
THE BIGGEST DECISION BEFORE THE

00:31:42.634 --> 00:31:43.401
COMMITTEE TODAY IS HOW TO

00:31:43.468 --> 00:31:44.636
DISTRIBUTE THE AVAILABLE FUNDS

00:31:44.702 --> 00:31:46.170
BETWEEN PROVIDING MORE

00:31:46.237 --> 00:31:47.672
APPLICANTS WITH AWARDS TO THE

00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:49.741
COMPETITIVE PROGRAM.

00:31:49.807 --> 00:31:50.775
AND INCREASING THE SIZE OF THOSE

00:31:50.842 --> 00:31:51.843
AWARDS THROUGH THE ACCESS

00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:53.578
COMPONENT.

00:31:53.645 --> 00:31:55.179
BOTH OF THESE AUGMENTATIONS ARE

00:31:55.246 --> 00:31:56.047
REASONABLE.

00:31:56.114 --> 00:31:57.649
AS MANY OF YOU NOTE REGARDING

00:31:57.715 --> 00:31:59.183
THE COMPETITIVE AWARD PROGRAM

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:00.752
THERE ARE ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED

00:32:00.818 --> 00:32:01.586
THOUSAND ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS

00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:03.821
EACH YEAR FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE

00:32:03.888 --> 00:32:05.223
THOUSAND AVAILABLE WORDS.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:05.990
SUGGESTING THAT THERE IS A LARGE

00:32:06.057 --> 00:32:07.625
AMOUNT OF ON THAT DEMAND FOR

00:32:07.692 --> 00:32:09.427
THIS PROGRAM.

00:32:09.494 --> 00:32:10.395
AS FOR THE ACCESS OR TO MOUNT

00:32:10.461 --> 00:32:12.597
THE CURRENT AWARD OF ABOUT

00:32:12.664 --> 00:32:13.231
SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR

00:32:13.298 --> 00:32:14.966
COVERS A RELATIVELY SMALL SHARE

00:32:15.033 --> 00:32:17.669
OF STUDENTS LIVING COSTS.

00:32:17.735 --> 00:32:19.037
CONSIDERATION WE WOULD RAISES

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:20.672
LEGISLATURE WAYS THESE TWO

00:32:20.738 --> 00:32:22.040
POSSIBLE ACTIONS IS THAT THEY DO

00:32:22.106 --> 00:32:24.042
HAVE DIFFERENT FISCAL

00:32:24.108 --> 00:32:25.910
IMPLICATIONS IN THE OUT YEARS.

00:32:25.977 --> 00:32:28.413
ADDING COMPETITIVE AWARDS IS

00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:30.348
ACTION THAT WAY IT SIMPLY PHASE

00:32:30.415 --> 00:32:31.249
AND OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL

00:32:31.316 --> 00:32:32.950
YEARS AS NEW AWARDS CONVERT TO

00:32:33.017 --> 00:32:33.885
RENEWALS.

00:32:33.951 --> 00:32:34.819
SO THAT THE COST OF FULL

00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:35.887
IMPLEMENTATION COULD BE

00:32:35.953 --> 00:32:37.789
SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER THAN IT IS

00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:39.991
IN YOUR ONE IN CONTRAST

00:32:40.058 --> 00:32:40.992
INCREASING THE SIZE OF THE AXIS

00:32:41.059 --> 00:32:42.160
AWARD WOULD ESSENTIALLY TAKE

00:32:42.226 --> 00:32:43.194
FULL EFFECT IN YOUR ONE THAT'S

00:32:43.261 --> 00:32:44.195
GENERATING.

00:32:44.262 --> 00:32:45.763
SOME LESS COST PRESSURE IN THE

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:46.230
OUT YEARS [inaudible]

00:32:46.297 --> 00:32:48.733
THANK YOU.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.702
THANK YOU FINANCE.

00:32:50.768 --> 00:32:52.203
I MAKE THREE POINTS THE FIRST IS

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:53.671
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:32:53.738 --> 00:32:55.373
GENERALLY -- IS SUPPORTIVE OF

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.141
THE CONCEPT OF INCREASING THE

00:32:57.208 --> 00:32:58.810
NUMBER OF PORTS AND THAT IS WHY

00:32:58.876 --> 00:33:00.278
THE GOVERNOR INCLUDED AN

00:33:00.345 --> 00:33:01.946
INCREASE AND THOSE COMPETITIVE

00:33:02.013 --> 00:33:04.215
AWARDS IN HIS GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

00:33:04.282 --> 00:33:05.083
AND MAY REVISION.

00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:07.018
THE SECOND POINT -- IS IT IS A

00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:08.353
REAL PRIORITY FOR THIS

00:33:08.419 --> 00:33:10.588
ADMINISTRATION TO FOCUS ON A TWO

00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:12.323
GENERATION APPROACH AND BREAK

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.392
THE CYCLE OF POVERTY AND MAKING

00:33:14.459 --> 00:33:15.526
SURE THAT BY INVESTING IN

00:33:15.593 --> 00:33:17.095
STUDENTS WHO ARE PARENTS WE HELP

00:33:17.161 --> 00:33:18.429
THOSE STUDENTS WERE IN SCHOOL

00:33:18.496 --> 00:33:19.931
AND WE HELP THEIR KIDS AND SO

00:33:19.997 --> 00:33:21.065
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

00:33:21.132 --> 00:33:22.667
ESPECIALLY IN AN ENVIRONMENT

00:33:22.734 --> 00:33:23.501
WHERE MANY PEOPLE DO NOT

00:33:23.568 --> 00:33:25.670
RECOGNIZE THAT ALMOST A QUARTER

00:33:25.737 --> 00:33:26.971
OF ALL COLLEGE STUDENTS WHEN YOU

00:33:27.038 --> 00:33:28.239
LOOK BETWEEN TWO AND FOUR YEAR

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:29.607
COLLEGES.

00:33:29.674 --> 00:33:30.141
OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE ALSO

00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:33.044
PERRANCE AND SO WE THOUGHT -- IT

00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:34.445
WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE

00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:35.980
THIS TO GENERATION APPROACH AND

00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:37.115
MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING A

00:33:37.181 --> 00:33:38.783
LOT OF RESOURCES IN A WAY THAT

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.551
CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE BEHAVIOR.

00:33:40.618 --> 00:33:41.486
AND HELPS IN PERRANCE BREAK OUT

00:33:41.552 --> 00:33:42.854
OF THAT CYCLE POVERTY AND CREATE

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.155
A BETTER FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES

00:33:44.222 --> 00:33:45.089
AND THEIR KIDS.

00:33:45.156 --> 00:33:46.591
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

00:33:46.657 --> 00:33:48.059
THESE FAMILIES DEPENDING ON

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:49.527
THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD BE

00:33:49.594 --> 00:33:51.963
ELIGIBLE FOR UP. TO SIX THOUSAND

00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:53.431
DOLLARS IN EIGHTY THREE THE

00:33:53.498 --> 00:33:54.799
PROGRAM AND WE THINK THAT TYPE

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:56.701
OF RESOURCES IS REALLY IMPORTANT

00:33:56.768 --> 00:33:57.602
FOR ACHIEVING THE GOVERNOR'S

00:33:57.668 --> 00:33:59.203
GOALS AND WE HOPE THAT THEY WILL

00:33:59.270 --> 00:34:03.274
BE GIVEN DUE CONSIDERATION.

00:34:03.341 --> 00:34:04.842
THANK YOU MEMBERS [inaudible]

00:34:04.909 --> 00:34:06.444
SENATOR ROBB.

00:34:06.511 --> 00:34:07.512
WELL ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS

00:34:07.578 --> 00:34:09.046
THAT.

00:34:09.113 --> 00:34:11.082
TO ENTERED INTO THE SENATE'S

00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:13.317
PROPOSAL HERE OUT OF BUDGET

00:34:13.384 --> 00:34:14.886
SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER ONE WAS THE

00:34:14.952 --> 00:34:17.722
STATISTICS THAT WE WERE PROVIDED

00:34:17.789 --> 00:34:20.591
THAT INDICATES THAT OUT OF SIXTY

00:34:20.658 --> 00:34:21.225
TWO THOUSAND STUDENT PARENTS WHO

00:34:21.292 --> 00:34:22.927
ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A NEW

00:34:22.994 --> 00:34:25.997
COMPETITIVE AWARD. FORTY FOUR

00:34:26.063 --> 00:34:27.331
THOUSAND DID NOT RECEIVE.

00:34:27.398 --> 00:34:29.634
ONE AND SO IT OCCURRED TO US IF

00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:31.469
WE TOOK THAT MONEY AND WE BUMPED

00:34:31.536 --> 00:34:33.171
UP THE NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE

00:34:33.237 --> 00:34:35.173
GRANT AWARDS WE MIGHT ACTUALLY

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:37.275
HAVE A MAKE A BIGGER IMPACT HAVE

00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:38.176
HAVE.

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:39.877
GET MORE BANG FOR OUR BUCK SO TO

00:34:39.944 --> 00:34:42.313
SPEAK AND AND ACTUALLY PROVIDE

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:45.049
MORE RESOURCES TO STUDENT

00:34:45.116 --> 00:34:46.884
PARENTS TO ALLOW THEM.

00:34:46.951 --> 00:34:48.719
TO DISSIPATING COMPLETE.

00:34:48.786 --> 00:34:50.922
TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS.

00:34:50.988 --> 00:34:52.089
I'LL JUST BRIEFLY COMMENT AND

00:34:52.156 --> 00:34:52.990
THEN LET MY COLLEAGUES WEIGH IN

00:34:53.057 --> 00:34:54.525
AS WELL I THINK IF YOU DO

00:34:54.592 --> 00:34:55.493
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.028
COMPETITIVE AWARDS -- YOU

00:34:57.094 --> 00:34:57.829
CERTAINLY WOULD REACH SOME

00:34:57.895 --> 00:34:58.963
STUDENT PARENTS AND THEY WOULD

00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.997
BE ABLE TO HAVE ADDITIONAL

00:35:00.064 --> 00:35:02.400
RESOURCES I THINK THE ISSUE IS

00:35:02.467 --> 00:35:03.768
THAT THAT RESOURCES ONE

00:35:03.835 --> 00:35:05.303
SPECIFICALLY BE DIRECTED AT THEM

00:35:05.369 --> 00:35:06.604
YOU'RE HELPING A BROADER RANGE

00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:08.673
OF PEOPLE ALL OF WHOM MAY BE

00:35:08.739 --> 00:35:10.141
DESERVING OF HELP IN SOME WAY.

00:35:10.208 --> 00:35:11.342
UP BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY GETS

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:12.577
THAT FCUS OF HELPING STUDENTS

00:35:12.643 --> 00:35:15.079
PARENTS DIRECTLY THROUGH THIS

00:35:15.146 --> 00:35:17.482
PROGRAM.

00:35:17.548 --> 00:35:18.516
YEAH I WOULD I WON'T ADD MUCH

00:35:18.583 --> 00:35:20.318
MORE BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THE

00:35:20.384 --> 00:35:21.486
WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO STEPPED

00:35:21.552 --> 00:35:23.254
VERSUS BREATH SO WE CERTAINLY

00:35:23.321 --> 00:35:25.323
RECOGNIZE THE WE WENT ON A A

00:35:25.389 --> 00:35:26.324
DEEPER VERY.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:28.893
DIED TARGETED APPROACH WHERE'S

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.428
THERE'S A A BROADER APPROACH OF

00:35:30.495 --> 00:35:32.263
SERVING MORE STUDENTS WITH THE

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:33.264
LOWER WORK.

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:36.100
BUT OF COURSE THE UNFORTUNATE

00:35:36.167 --> 00:35:36.901
THING IS WHEN YOU'RE.

00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:38.135
TALKING ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

00:35:38.202 --> 00:35:41.038
THOUSAND PLUS -- APPLICANTS FOR

00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:43.641
A PROGRAM WHETHER IT'S GOT FORTY

00:35:43.708 --> 00:35:45.977
THOUSAND OR THIRTY THOUSAND OR

00:35:46.043 --> 00:35:47.144
FIFTY THOUSAND THE UNFORTUNATE

00:35:47.211 --> 00:35:49.514
THING IS WE'RE NOT REALLY --

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.082
CURRENTLY DOING THE JOB WE NEED

00:35:51.148 --> 00:35:51.983
TO DO.

00:35:52.049 --> 00:35:53.317
IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE AID TO

00:35:53.384 --> 00:35:54.986
FOLKS TO GET INTO SCHOOL GET

00:35:55.052 --> 00:35:56.587
CREDENTIAL THEY NEED AND AND GET

00:35:56.654 --> 00:35:58.189
BACK OUT AND GET A JOB AND WE'RE

00:35:58.256 --> 00:35:59.190
GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE THIS THING

00:35:59.257 --> 00:36:01.225
OUT BECAUSE WE SPENT A LOT OF

00:36:01.292 --> 00:36:02.960
MONEY AND A LOT OF TIME AND AND

00:36:03.027 --> 00:36:04.862
ATTENTION ON CREW.

00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:06.931
TECH EDUCATION AND JOB SKILLS

00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:07.832

00:36:10.301 --> 00:36:11.502
FOLKS.

00:36:11.569 --> 00:36:12.837
I THINK IT'S A FAIR STATEMENT

00:36:12.904 --> 00:36:14.505
WHO DON'T MOVE IMMEDIATELY INTO

00:36:14.572 --> 00:36:16.340
SCHOOL FROM HIGH SCHOOL AND SO

00:36:16.407 --> 00:36:17.675
IF THERE ARE TWO OR THREE YEARS.

00:36:17.742 --> 00:36:20.011
THEY THEY DON'T QUALIFY FOR THE

00:36:20.077 --> 00:36:21.579

ISSUES FOR CONSIDERATION. ONE

00:42:29.546 --> 00:42:30.314
ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH THE

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:31.582
GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF

00:42:31.649 --> 00:42:32.616

EXISTING CHILD SAVINGS PROGRAMS.

00:42:40.858 --> 00:42:43.661
WHICH TEND TO BE CONCENTRATED

00:42:43.727 --> 00:42:44.228
WITHIN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:45.529
STATE.

00:42:45.596 --> 00:42:46.330
IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO

00:42:46.397 --> 00:42:46.964
FIND MORE LOCAL GRANT THAT MAY

00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:48.132
WISH TO MAKE SOME OF THESE

00:42:48.198 --> 00:42:49.433
GRANTS AVAILABLE TO SEE TAUGHT

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.001

THE MORE EVENLY DISTRIBUTED.

00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:56.740
A STATEWIDE APPROACH WOULD BY

00:42:56.807 --> 00:42:57.708
DESIGN ADDRESS THIS CONCERN

00:42:57.775 --> 00:43:01.045
ABOUT GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION.

00:43:01.111 --> 00:43:01.879
THE OTHER CONSIDERATION WOULD

00:43:01.946 --> 00:43:03.180
RATE HAS TO DO WITH TARGETING

00:43:03.247 --> 00:43:05.649
THE FUNDS. SIX CHILDREN FROM

00:43:05.716 --> 00:43:06.650
LOWER INCOME FAMILIES ARE

00:43:06.717 --> 00:43:07.818
CURRENTLY LESS LIKELY TO HAVE

COLLEGE SAVINGS LEGISLATURE MAY

00:43:09.586 --> 00:43:12.423

00:43:21.832 --> 00:43:23.200
IF ON THE OTHER HAND IT TO THE

00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:24.868
STATE WIDE APPROACH IN MAY WISH

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:26.236

NINETY MILLION DOLLARS TO

00:46:36.059 --> 00:46:37.461
FRONT AID. TO STUDENTS PURSUING

SUBJECT AREAS. TO QUALIFY FOR

00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:42.566
THE STATE STUDENTS WOULD NEED TO

00:46:42.633 --> 00:46:44.201
COMMIT TO WORKING IN THE SUBJECT

00:46:44.268 --> 00:46:46.336

00:46:46.403 --> 00:46:48.305
THEIR FUNDS.

00:46:48.372 --> 00:46:49.406
THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO

00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:50.707
HOUSES APPROACHES AS A MATTER OF

00:46:50.774 --> 00:46:52.142
TIMING WHETHER THE AID IS

00:46:52.209 --> 00:46:53.810
AVAILABLE TO TEACHERS WHILE

00:46:58.348 --> 00:46:59.116

AS THEIR COMPLETING THE WORK

00:47:00.551 --> 00:47:04.221
REQUIREMENTS.

00:47:04.288 --> 00:47:07.391
RAISE A COUPLE OF CONSIDERATION.

00:47:07.457 --> 00:47:09.159
ON ONE HAND A PRINT SCHOLARSHIPS

00:47:09.226 --> 00:47:11.361
COULD SERVICE STRONG INCENTIVES

00:47:11.428 --> 00:47:12.496
FOR STUDENTS TO PURSUE CERTAIN

00:47:12.563 --> 00:47:13.730
KERR POTS.

00:47:13.797 --> 00:47:15.098
THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE

00:47:15.165 --> 00:47:16.800
BECAUSE SOME STUDENTS MAY BE

00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:18.735
AVERSE TO TAKING OUT LOANS.

00:47:18.802 --> 00:47:19.670
ON THE OTHER HAND IT MAY BE

00:47:19.736 --> 00:47:20.771
WORTH NOTING THAT UP FRONT

00:47:20.837 --> 00:47:22.072
SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM COULD HAVE

00:47:22.139 --> 00:47:23.640
HIRED MINISTRY OF COSTS AS

BEFORE THEY COMPLETE THE

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:27.678
REQUIRED WORK.

00:47:27.744 --> 00:47:29.713
AND THE ADMINISTERING AGENCY MAY

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:32.916
NEED TO TRACK THE STUDENTS AS

00:47:32.983 --> 00:47:33.517

AND COLLECT THREE PAYMENTS FROM

THE STUDENTS IF THEY DO NOT

00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:39.856
COMPLETE AS REQUIREMENTS.

00:47:39.923 --> 00:47:40.991
WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES

00:47:41.058 --> 00:47:42.059

FRONT SCHOLARSHIP OR LOAN

00:47:44.228 --> 00:47:44.795
REPAYMENT WE KNOW THAT IT DOES

00:47:44.861 --> 00:47:47.197
HAVE OPTIONS TO TARGET THE FUNDS

00:47:47.264 --> 00:47:48.532

IN SCHOOLS FACING SHORTAGES.

00:48:02.679 --> 00:48:03.814
THE LEGISLATURE MAVEN MUST

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:04.581
CONSIDER COMBINING THESE

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:06.450
CRITERIA SAID THAT THE FUNDS GO

00:48:06.516 --> 00:48:07.884

INVESTMENT IN THIS AREA -- BUT

00:48:22.466 --> 00:48:24.268
ULTIMATELY I THINK THE ONE

00:48:24.334 --> 00:48:25.369
IMPORTANT ASPECT FROM THE

I DON'T KNOW IF I'D WANT TO CALL

00:48:56.066 --> 00:49:01.838
IT QUANDARY BUT ON THE ONE HAND.

00:49:01.905 --> 00:49:03.507

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:11.748
TO FORGIVE ALONE.

00:49:11.815 --> 00:49:13.583
HAS THERE'S A LOT OF LOGIC TO IT

00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:15.419
ON THE OTHER HAND.

00:49:15.485 --> 00:49:18.155
WOULD WE BE INCENTIVIZING MORE

00:49:18.221 --> 00:49:20.691

FACT THAT FEWER STUDENTS MAY BE

00:49:32.302 --> 00:49:33.103
MEN TRYING TO PURSUE A

00:49:33.170 --> 00:49:36.740
CREDENTIAL JUST BECAUSE IF THEY

GIVEN THE COST OF THE COLLEGE

00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:40.477
INVESTMENT TO GET THE CREDENTIAL

00:49:40.544 --> 00:49:42.312

00:49:46.983 --> 00:49:50.087
IN RIGHT NOW WITH -- OUR COST OF

00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:52.656
LIVING IN THE LOW UNEMPLOYMENT

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:54.991
AND SUCH THAT MAY BE A BARRIER

00:49:55.058 --> 00:49:56.660
TO ARE GETTING STUDENTS SO I

00:49:56.727 --> 00:49:58.128

OF THE THINGS RECESSION DID WAS

00:50:38.034 --> 00:50:40.003
CERTAINLY CLEARED A LOT OF YOUNG

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:44.674
TEACHERS -- AND YOU WERE MORE

00:50:44.741 --> 00:50:45.409

GO BACK TO TEACHING.

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.215
SO WHY IN WHERE ARE THEY NOW ON

00:50:52.282 --> 00:50:54.117

SO.

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:59.122
OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE A

NEW TEACHER IF THERE'S A

00:51:01.024 --> 00:51:02.993
RECESSION OR IF ENROLLMENT

AND SO THAT.

00:51:10.767 --> 00:51:12.402
THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF TOUGH FOR

00:51:12.469 --> 00:51:14.070
YOUNG KIDS TO TO FACE THE WHITE

TELL YOUR STORY AND HE SAID I

00:58:17.994 --> 00:58:19.429
WAS AT SCHOOL ONE DAY AND I WENT

00:58:19.495 --> 00:58:20.663
TO THE BATHROOM.

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:24.400
AND THERE WAS A YOUNG BOY MY AGE.

00:58:24.467 --> 00:58:25.902
SITTING ON THE FLOOR CRYING

00:58:25.969 --> 00:58:28.938
UNCONTROLLABLY -- I DID NOT KNOW

00:58:29.005 --> 00:58:30.039
WHAT TO DO.

00:58:30.106 --> 00:58:32.442
I TURNED SINCE WE DIDN'T HAVE A

00:58:32.508 --> 00:58:34.177
SCHOOL NURSE OR COUNSELOR.

00:58:34.244 --> 00:58:36.446
ON THE CAMPUS -- I BECAME THE

00:58:36.512 --> 00:58:38.815
COUNSELOR. TO CALM THE YOUNG MAN

00:58:38.882 --> 00:58:39.749
IN.

00:58:39.816 --> 00:58:41.184
GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE HE

00:58:41.251 --> 00:58:43.386
COULD RETURN THE CLASSROOM.

00:58:43.453 --> 00:58:43.987
AND IN THE TEACHER COULD HELP

00:58:44.053 --> 00:58:47.056
THEM.

00:58:47.123 --> 00:58:50.059
HEY IT BECAME A BOTHERSOME TO ME.

00:58:50.126 --> 00:58:51.694
WE HAVE COUNTIES WITH PROP SIXTY

00:58:51.761 --> 00:58:53.229
THREE MONEY.

00:58:53.296 --> 00:58:54.464
RIVERSIDE COUNTY THE LAST TIME I

00:58:54.530 --> 00:58:55.765
CHECKED.

00:58:55.832 --> 00:58:57.233
AT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY

00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:58.167
SIX MILLION DOLLARS SITTING IN

00:58:58.234 --> 00:59:00.003
THE BANK.

00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:01.938
LA PROBABLY AS CLOSE TO A

00:59:02.005 --> 00:59:03.273
BILLION.

00:59:03.339 --> 00:59:05.675
SO THE IDEA HERE IS TO TRY TO

00:59:05.742 --> 00:59:08.044
JUMP START THE SYSTEM.

00:59:08.111 --> 00:59:09.445
AND TO GET COUNTIES.

00:59:09.512 --> 00:59:12.181
ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN WORKING.

00:59:12.248 --> 00:59:13.783
PRIMARILY WITH THE K. THROUGH

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:14.884
TWELVE DISTRICTS AND COUNTY

00:59:14.951 --> 00:59:17.186
OFFICES OF EDUCATION -- TO

00:59:17.253 --> 00:59:20.556
CREATE PARTNERSHIPS. TO PROVIDE

00:59:20.623 --> 00:59:22.792
MENTAL HEALTH AS SINCE.

00:59:22.859 --> 00:59:24.327
ON THESE CAMPUSES PERHAPS MAYBE

00:59:24.394 --> 00:59:26.796
NOT FULL TIME IN ON EVERY CAMPUS

00:59:26.863 --> 00:59:28.131
BUT HAVE SOME SYSTEM.

00:59:28.197 --> 00:59:29.699
SO THAT STUDENTS KNOW WHO TO

00:59:29.766 --> 00:59:32.468
TURN TO PARENTS KNOW WHO TO TURN.

00:59:32.535 --> 00:59:33.937
TO AND TEACHERS IN CLASSROOMS

00:59:34.003 --> 00:59:36.773
KNOW WHO TO GO. TO TO PROVIDE.

00:59:36.839 --> 00:59:39.008
WHAT IS OBVIOUSLY SOME FAIRLY

00:59:39.075 --> 00:59:41.044
BADLY NEEDED SERVICES? TO

00:59:41.110 --> 00:59:43.346
STUDENTS UP TO CLEAN K. TO

00:59:43.413 --> 00:59:45.014
TWELVE BUT IT ALSO -- COULD

00:59:45.081 --> 00:59:48.017
IMPACT TO CC ISSUE AND AND YOU

00:59:48.084 --> 00:59:49.185
SEE AS WELL.

00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:50.753
THAT'S REALLY THE POINT OF THIS

00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:51.854
SOMEBODY HAS TO START DOING

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:53.623
SOMETHING.

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:55.591
NOW SOME COUNTIES -- AND SOME

00:59:55.658 --> 00:59:56.893
COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION ARE

00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.528
ACTIVELY INVOLVED ARE ACTIVELY

00:59:58.594 --> 01:00:00.163
INVOLVED IN PARTICIPATING ON THE

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:01.831
PROP.

01:00:01.898 --> 01:00:02.765
SIXTY THREE COMMITTEES AT THAT I

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:05.435
GUESS EXIST AROUND THE STATE TO

01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:06.069
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DIVIDE UP THIS

01:00:06.135 --> 01:00:07.036
MONEY.

01:00:07.103 --> 01:00:09.038
OTHERS NO PARTICIPATED ALL AND

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:10.640
DISTRICT SUPERINTENDENTS DON'T

01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:12.141
<u>&lt;c.blue&gt;VEN KNOW THAT ASSET TO THEIR&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:14.344
THE TAKEN TAP.

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:15.945
SO WHAT WHAT WE HAVE WE HAVE

01:00:16.012 --> 01:00:17.847
FAILED.

01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:19.415
THIS EDUCATION SYSTEM WHEN IT

01:00:19.482 --> 01:00:20.550
COMES TO ROLLING OUT MENTAL

01:00:20.616 --> 01:00:22.785
HEALTH SERVICES.

01:00:22.852 --> 01:00:24.721
AND WHEN IT BEGINS TO IMPACT.

01:00:24.787 --> 01:00:26.622
OF TWELVE YEAR OLDS.

01:00:26.689 --> 01:00:28.624
ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES BUT THAT'S A

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:31.661
DISGRACE SO I DON'T KNOW IF THIS

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:31.828
IS.

01:00:31.894 --> 01:00:34.731
THE PERFECT WAY TO DO THIS BUT

01:00:34.797 --> 01:00:35.298
SOMEBODY'S GOT TO FIND SOME

01:00:35.365 --> 01:00:36.466
MONEY.

01:00:36.532 --> 01:00:38.334
OR GET A BIG CROWBAR TO PRY

01:00:38.401 --> 01:00:40.003
MONEY OUT OF COUNTIES. TO FORCE

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:43.740
THEM TO INVEST IN SERVICES.

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.108
ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES.

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:46.676
END OF SPEECH PERFECT BUT THANK

01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:47.744
YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:50.546
THANK YOU MANAGER THANK YOU SIR

01:00:50.613 --> 01:00:52.615
FOR SHARING THE STORY.

01:00:52.682 --> 01:00:53.683
MISTER MOORE Là.

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:55.284
MADAM CHAIR I JUST WANT.

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:59.455
TO THANK SENATOR ROSS -- FOR

01:00:59.522 --> 01:01:00.423
WHAT HE'S TRYING TO DO -- BUT

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:01.457
IT'S NICE TO SEE THE GOVERNOR

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:03.259
ASK FOR FIVE POINT THREE MILLION

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:05.428
AND THEN WE RESPOND WITH FIVE

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:07.263
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION --

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.065
THERE'S GOT TO BE AN AWARD IN

01:01:09.132 --> 01:01:11.934
THERE FOR THAT [inaudible]

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:15.605
BUT I'M.

01:01:15.671 --> 01:01:17.774
I AM NOT PRE MED BUT I I HAVE

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:18.541
SPENT A LOT OF TIME.

01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:19.976
MEANWHILE SERVICES ACT OVER THE

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:20.810
LAST.

01:01:20.877 --> 01:01:23.012
DECADE OR SO.

01:01:23.079 --> 01:01:25.415
IN A LOT OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

01:01:25.481 --> 01:01:26.649
YOU REALLY START TO REVEAL

01:01:26.716 --> 01:01:27.984
THEMSELVES WHEN PEOPLE TURN

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:30.753
ABOUT TWENTY ONE SORT OF HAPPENS

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:32.422
IN COLLEGE AND OR SEEING A SHOW

01:01:32.488 --> 01:01:34.657
UP A LOT EARLIER FOR A LOT OF

01:01:34.724 --> 01:01:36.592
INDIVIDUALS.

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:37.660
DURING THE BREAK I HAD THE

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:41.330
CHANCE -- TO OBSERVE A PROGRAM

01:01:41.397 --> 01:01:43.433
IN NEWPORT BEACH WITH HOAG.

01:01:43.499 --> 01:01:46.002
MEMORIAL PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL.

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:47.303
IT'S CALLED A SPIRE AND THEY

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:49.772
TAKE THE PARENTS AND THE KIDS TO

01:01:49.839 --> 01:01:51.107
TAKE HIM OFF CAMPUS IN THEIR

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:52.842
TEACHING BOTH BECAUSE PARENTS

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:53.976
ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:56.145
WHAT IS HAPPENING?

01:01:56.212 --> 01:01:58.848
BUT THEIR CHILD WHEN HE AND IF

01:01:58.915 --> 01:02:01.150
THEY BASED ON A MODEL OUT OF

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:02.585
SANTA CLARA COUNTY.

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:04.520
AND IT WAS VERY IMPRESSIVE BUT

01:02:04.587 --> 01:02:07.423
WHAT WAS MISSING.

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:09.125
FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE WAS THAT

01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:10.259
THE KIDS WOULD LEAVE THE CAMPUS

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:12.695
GO TO THE THE CAMPUS FOR THE

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:13.796
HOSPITAL.

01:02:13.863 --> 01:02:14.831
BUT THEY WOULDN'T GET CREDIT FOR

01:02:14.897 --> 01:02:16.833
THE COURSES.

01:02:16.899 --> 01:02:18.101
AND SO THERE'S GOT TO BE MAYBE

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:19.535
WITH SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:21.037
LOOKING FOR INNOVATION WHICH IS

01:02:21.104 --> 01:02:22.371
WHAT'S BEEN HOLDING UP MENTAL

01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:23.673
HEALTH SERVICES ACT.

01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:25.842
EVERYTHING HAS TO BE INNOVATIVE

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:26.375
AND THERE'S REALLY NOTHING

01:02:26.442 --> 01:02:29.011
INNOVATIVE ANYMORE -- IF IF WE

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:30.713
COULD FOCUS ON JUST DOING MORE

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:33.516
INTEGRATION SEVERAL THE SILOS --

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:36.252
WITH PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE.

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:37.553
AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT NEEDS

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.021
FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

01:02:39.088 --> 01:02:40.022
IT MAY JUST ALREADY BE SITTING

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:41.257
THERE SO IT'S NOT REALLY LIKE A

01:02:41.324 --> 01:02:44.393
NEW REVENUE -- SOURCE BUT MAYBE

01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:46.229
MAYBE WE NEED TO WORK WITH THE

01:02:46.295 --> 01:02:47.930
STEINBERG INSTITUTE MAYBE WE

01:02:47.997 --> 01:02:49.031
NEED IT BECAUSE OF BECAUSE WORK

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:49.499
WERE CHIPPING AWAY.

01:02:49.565 --> 01:02:50.800
BUT WE'RE WE'RE USING MENTAL

01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:53.669
HEALTH SERVICES ACT OUT TO TO

01:02:53.736 --> 01:02:54.270
FIND FOR LAURA'S LAW WHICH IS

01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:55.204
SOMETHING THAT.

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:56.772
SENATOR STEINBERG AND I DID BACK

01:02:56.839 --> 01:02:59.542
IN TWENTY THIRTEEN WITH SB FIVE

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:02.678
EIGHTY FIVE WHAT WORK WERE USING.

01:03:02.745 --> 01:03:04.380
THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE SECTOR.

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:05.781
AS A AS A REVENUE SOURCE FOR

01:03:05.848 --> 01:03:07.283
THAT NO PLACE LIKE HOME PROGRAM

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:09.352
TO WORK WITH CANADA DOING THINGS

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:09.852
RIGHT BUT IT'S ALL GOING

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:10.686
LEGISLATIVELY.

01:03:10.753 --> 01:03:11.354
IT'S A MAYBE WE NEED TO LOOK AT

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:12.722
A A BETTER PACKAGE AND HOW WE

01:03:12.788 --> 01:03:13.489
INTEGRATE THE MENTAL HEALTH

01:03:13.556 --> 01:03:16.425
SERVICES ACT WITH EDUCATION.

01:03:16.492 --> 01:03:17.894
SO WE IDENTIFY THINGS MORE.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.863
EARLIER AND PROVIDE THE STAFFING

01:03:20.930 --> 01:03:22.999
WITH ACCOUNTS ARE NOT ONLY A YOU

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:24.267
KNOW HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES BUT

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:25.635
BUT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES ART.

01:03:25.701 --> 01:03:27.637
I THINK.

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:28.237
THE WEEK WE COULD LOOK AT A

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:29.038
LITTLE MORE.

01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:30.373
BROADLY BECAUSE WE WE HAVE

01:03:30.439 --> 01:03:31.874
RESOURCES.

01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:33.309
AND AND HOW DO WE USE THEM MORE

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:35.244
EFFECTIVELY -- AS OPPOSED TO

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:36.913
JUST ALWAYS BEING.

01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:38.581
LIMITED BY A COMMITTEE THIS

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:39.749
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEES HAS NOW

01:03:39.815 --> 01:03:41.384
THAT'S NOT INNOVATIVE FORGET IT

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:44.220
IT'S LIKE WAY TO SAY WE GOT WE

01:03:44.287 --> 01:03:45.254
GOT TO GET PAST THAT IT'S THAT.

01:03:45.321 --> 01:03:46.789
GET IT TO WHERE IT WORKS.

01:03:46.856 --> 01:03:48.624
AND SO THERE'S MY SPEECH THANK

01:03:48.691 --> 01:03:51.360
YOU AND THANK YOU BOTH AND GOOD

01:03:51.427 --> 01:03:53.596

THEY NEED TO BE BETTER THAN

01:03:54.864 --> 01:03:56.499
THOSE TO MR MCCARTY SO BRING IT

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:58.034

TALK ABOUT IT WE HAD.

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:07.910
A COMPELLING TESTIMONY IN OUR

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:08.578
COMMITTEES WELL ESPECIALLY FROM

THOSE CALLS STUDENTS TALKING

01:04:09.779 --> 01:04:11.581
ABOUT WHAT STUDENTS FACE THESE

01:04:11.647 --> 01:04:14.016
DAYS WITH THEIR FINANCIAL

01:04:14.083 --> 01:04:16.452
PRESSURES AND A NUMBER -- TWO

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:18.888
CAUSE OF DEATH FOR THOSE THIS

01:04:18.955 --> 01:04:19.589

COLLEGE STUDENT SO HE'S BEEN A

01:04:25.962 --> 01:04:27.630
LEADER IN THIS SPACE I THINK THE

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:28.965
ISSUE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT'S

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:30.633
IT'S EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING THESE

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:31.934
COUNTIES ARE SITTING ON THEIR

01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:32.635
MONEY.

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:33.936
BUT THERE IS SOME MONEY AT THE

01:04:34.003 --> 01:04:35.504
STATE LEVEL THAT WE OUGHT TO SET

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:36.939
SOME STATE PRIORITIES AND SO

01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:38.708
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING AND I

01:04:38.774 --> 01:04:39.308

01:25:13.374 --> 01:25:14.642
THAT -- STAFF THERE WILL.

01:25:14.709 --> 01:25:23.117
AND BE GETTING TRAINED ON THE

01:25:23.184 --> 01:25:23.718
PROPER WAY TO DO A PRESCRIBED

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:25.353
FIRE.

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:25.887
SO THE ISSUES THAT ARE IN

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:26.654
CONFERENCE ARE PRIMARILY THAT

01:25:26.721 --> 01:25:27.422
THE C. ONE THIRTY PROGRAM THE

01:25:27.489 --> 01:25:28.690
JANUARY PEACE AS WELL AS THAT

01:25:28.756 --> 01:25:29.991
MAKE PROPOSAL.

01:25:30.058 --> 01:25:31.025
AND ON THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE

01:25:31.092 --> 01:25:31.726
FROM BOTH HOUSES IS ALSO IN

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:32.994
CONFERENCE.

01:25:33.061 --> 01:25:33.595
SO DURING THE COURSE OF THE

01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:34.162
BUDGET CYCLE THERE WERE SOME

01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:35.263
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE COST

01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:37.098
EFFECTIVENESS OF DIFFERENT

01:25:37.165 --> 01:25:38.933
METHODS OF FIGHTING FIRES -- IN

01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:40.101
PARTICULAR IN THE C. ONE

01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:41.703
THIRTIES THERE WAS SOME MEDIA

01:25:41.769 --> 01:25:43.171
REPORTS ABOUT.

01:25:43.238 --> 01:25:44.439
ON THE LARGE AIR TANKERS MAYBE

01:25:44.506 --> 01:25:46.040
NOT BEING THE MOST COST

01:25:46.107 --> 01:25:46.608
EFFECTIVE WAY TO FIGHT FIRES

01:25:46.674 --> 01:25:49.043
BECAUSE IN THE INSTANCES WHERE

01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:50.144
THERE REALLY NEEDED THESE VERY

01:25:50.211 --> 01:25:51.513
LARGE CATASTROPHIC FIRES.

01:25:51.579 --> 01:25:52.780
THEY CAN OFTEN BE GROUNDED

01:25:52.847 --> 01:25:54.782
BECAUSE THE WEATHER CONDITIONS

01:25:54.849 --> 01:25:56.284
WILL ALLOW THEM TO FLY THE WINDS

01:25:56.351 --> 01:25:57.418
MIGHT BE.

01:25:57.485 --> 01:26:00.121
TO GUSTY OR THE SMOKE MIGHT AND

01:26:00.188 --> 01:26:02.290
PREVENT THEM FROM FLYING.

01:26:02.357 --> 01:26:02.924
I'M OUR OFFICE HAD ALSO RAISED

01:26:02.991 --> 01:26:04.559
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT JUST A

01:26:04.626 --> 01:26:06.794
GENERAL LACK OF INFORMATION ON

01:26:06.861 --> 01:26:09.163
THE AND OVERALL.

01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:10.732
ASSESSMENT OF WHICH APPROACHES

01:26:10.798 --> 01:26:12.166
TO FIGHTING FIRES ARE MORE COST

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:13.935
EFFECTIVE -- AND SO WE'D

01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:15.837
ACTUALLY RECOMMENDED AND IT'S

01:26:15.904 --> 01:26:17.071
NOT PART OF THIS ITEM IS PART OF

01:26:17.138 --> 01:26:17.872
YOUR S. ARE A LEGEND OF THAT

01:26:17.939 --> 01:26:18.840
YOU'LL GET TO LEADER.

01:26:18.907 --> 01:26:20.542
BUT WE HAD RECOMMENDED I'M DOING

01:26:20.608 --> 01:26:23.378
AN ASSESSMENT -- OF HAVING HOW

01:26:23.444 --> 01:26:24.212
FAR REALLY LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE

01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:25.213
DIFFERENT YOU KNOW CAUGHT MORE

01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:26.814
COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH AS THE

01:26:26.881 --> 01:26:28.216
ASSEMBLY VERSION OF THE S. R. O.

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:29.617
BUDGET -- INCLUDE SAID

01:26:29.684 --> 01:26:31.319
ASSESSMENT SO WE THINK IF YOU DO

01:26:31.386 --> 01:26:32.453
WANT TO HAVE THAT ASSESSMENT

01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:33.721
DONE IF YOU DO DECIDE TO GO

01:26:33.788 --> 01:26:35.557
FORWARD THAT -- A POTENTIAL

01:26:35.623 --> 01:26:37.425
COMPROMISE HERE -- IF YOU'RE

01:26:37.492 --> 01:26:39.027
INTERESTED IN THAT WOULD BE TO

01:26:39.093 --> 01:26:40.562
MAYBE DO ONE YEAR OF FUNDING FOR

01:26:40.628 --> 01:26:42.297
THE C. ONE THIRTY PROGRAMS AT

01:26:42.363 --> 01:26:43.765
LEAST FOR CERTAIN PIECES OF IT --

01:26:43.831 --> 01:26:45.300
IN PARTICULAR PROVIDING THAT

01:26:45.366 --> 01:26:47.702
EXCLUSIVE USE CONTRACT CLEAN FOR

01:26:47.769 --> 01:26:49.203
A YEAR COULD HELP INFORMING

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:51.105
ASSESSMENT OF HOW FREQUENTLY IT

01:26:51.172 --> 01:26:53.107
WAS USED -- WERE THERE INSTANCES

01:26:53.174 --> 01:26:55.009
WHERE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DESIRE

01:26:55.076 --> 01:26:56.010
TO BE USED BUT ENDED UP BEING

01:26:56.077 --> 01:26:58.413
GROUNDED HOW BECAUSE OF WEATHER.

01:26:58.479 --> 01:26:59.547
AND AND SO THAT COULD BE ONE

01:26:59.614 --> 01:27:01.482
POTENTIAL COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE

01:27:01.549 --> 01:27:02.917
TWO HOUSES -- IF YOU'RE NOT

01:27:02.984 --> 01:27:04.218
GOING TO DO THE ASSESSMENT

01:27:04.285 --> 01:27:05.787
PROVIDING WHEN YOU'RE MAYBE

01:27:05.853 --> 01:27:07.956
DOESN'T HELP THAT MUCH I AM.

01:27:08.022 --> 01:27:09.857
BY IF YOU ARE I'M INTERESTED IN

01:27:09.924 --> 01:27:15.296
MORE INFORMATION THAN THAT AND

01:27:15.363 --> 01:27:15.830
THAT WHEN YOU'RE WOULD BE

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:16.631
HELPFUL.

01:27:16.698 --> 01:27:17.765
THANK YOU FINANCE PLEASE MAKE

01:27:17.832 --> 01:27:18.466
THREE BRIEF POINTS FIRST IS THAT

01:27:18.533 --> 01:27:19.100
THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING

01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:19.968
A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MEASURES

01:27:20.034 --> 01:27:21.102
AS PART OF ITS PACKAGE FOR

01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:22.570
FIGHTING WILDFIRES.

01:27:22.637 --> 01:27:24.405
BUT THE C. ONE THIRTIES ARE AN

01:27:24.472 --> 01:27:26.007
IMPORTANT PART OF THAT AT THESE --

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:27.475
TANKERS ARE BEING TRANSFERRED

01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:29.210
AND RETROFITTED AT NO COST TO

01:27:29.277 --> 01:27:30.712
THE STATE SO ALL THESE ARE

01:27:30.778 --> 01:27:32.447
OPERATIONAL COSTS AND WE THINK

01:27:32.513 --> 01:27:33.881
WE REALLY NEED TO START OUR IN

01:27:33.948 --> 01:27:35.316
THE BUDGET YEAR TO GET THESE UP

01:27:35.383 --> 01:27:36.751
AND RUNNING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:38.386
BECAUSE WE KNOW GIVEN WHAT WE

01:27:38.453 --> 01:27:39.387
SAW LAST YEAR THAT.

01:27:39.454 --> 01:27:40.688
WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED FOR

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:42.056
WHATEVER COMES -- AND SO THE

01:27:42.123 --> 01:27:43.224
SECOND POINT IS WE DO SUPPORT

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:44.425
THE SENATE ACTION ON THIS

01:27:44.492 --> 01:27:46.461
PROPOSAL AND WE ARE COMFORTABLE

01:27:46.527 --> 01:27:48.663
WITH THE SENATE SO -- LANGUAGE

01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:49.430
REGARDING HEALTH AND WLLNESS

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:51.466
REPORTING -- AND THIRD -- FOR

01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:52.867
THAT LANGUAGE -- FROM THE

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:55.269
ASSEMBLY WE BELIEVE THAT REDUCES

01:27:55.336 --> 01:27:57.305
FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF PUTTING

01:27:57.372 --> 01:27:58.406
RESOURCES IN THE HIGHEST NEED

01:27:58.473 --> 01:28:00.174
AREAS OF THE STATE IN TERMS OF

01:28:00.241 --> 01:28:01.576
MOST WILD FIRE RESCUE -- SO FOR

01:28:01.643 --> 01:28:02.944
THAT REASON WE SUPPORT THE

01:28:03.011 --> 01:28:06.247
SENATE PROPOSAL ON THIS ISSUE.

01:28:06.314 --> 01:28:08.650
THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH.

01:28:08.716 --> 01:28:10.852
WELL I ASSUME -- THIS EFFORT IS.

01:28:10.918 --> 01:28:12.186
AN EFFORT TO MODERNIZE YEAR

01:28:12.253 --> 01:28:12.887
FLEET.

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:14.055
WITH THE ACQUISITION OF THE UC

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:15.657
ONE THIRTIES IS THAT IS THAT THE

01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:17.291
PROGRAM.

01:28:17.358 --> 01:28:19.060
THAT'S CORRECT YES.

01:28:19.127 --> 01:28:20.528
WHEN THE AIRFORCE RESERVE IN THE

01:28:20.595 --> 01:28:22.196
AIR NATIONAL GUARD BOWS FLY SEE

01:28:22.263 --> 01:28:23.531
ONE THIRTIES AND?

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:25.033
BOTH HAVE A FIRE FIGHTING

01:28:25.099 --> 01:28:26.901
MISSION.

01:28:26.968 --> 01:28:28.670
HERE IN CALIFORNIA I THINK THE

01:28:28.736 --> 01:28:30.972
AIRFORCE RESERVIST ON COLORADO

01:28:31.039 --> 01:28:33.241
SPRINGS COLORADO.

01:28:33.307 --> 01:28:35.443
A MY RECOLLECTION I WOULD NOT ON

01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:37.078
THIS BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE SO I

01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:39.013
DIDN'T HEAR THE DISCUSSION.

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:41.549
IS OUR CALIFORNIA AIR FLEET IS

01:28:41.616 --> 01:28:44.652
AGING IS THAT NOT CORRECT.

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:47.488
AND THE PROP.

01:28:47.555 --> 01:28:47.989
BENSON BERMAN FINE IT'S

01:28:48.056 --> 01:28:49.624
ABSOLUTELY YES IT IS AND THE

01:28:49.691 --> 01:28:50.825
PROBLEM WITH AN AGING.

01:28:50.892 --> 01:28:54.128
FLEET OF FLYING A FIRE FIGHTING

01:28:54.195 --> 01:28:55.963
MISSION IS THE STRESS ON THE AIR

01:28:56.030 --> 01:28:57.932
FRAME IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT WHEN

01:28:57.999 --> 01:28:58.633
YOU'RE DOING WHAT YOU'RE

01:28:58.700 --> 01:28:59.867
SUPPOSED TO DO TO DROP THE

01:28:59.934 --> 01:29:01.202
RETARDANT.

01:29:01.269 --> 01:29:03.271
WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE?

01:29:03.337 --> 01:29:04.338
AND THE RISK IS THE WING SNAP

01:29:04.405 --> 01:29:06.274
OFF.

01:29:06.340 --> 01:29:08.076
AND THEY DON'T PLAY VERY WELL

01:29:08.142 --> 01:29:10.178
WITHOUT WINGS.

01:29:10.244 --> 01:29:11.679
SO I'M A LITTLE.

01:29:11.746 --> 01:29:14.248
PERPLEXED BY THE DECISION NOT TO

01:29:14.315 --> 01:29:16.551
PROCEED WITH THIS.

01:29:16.617 --> 01:29:18.853
C. ONE THIRTY PROGRAM.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.388
UNLESS WE'RE GETTING OUT OF THE

01:29:20.455 --> 01:29:21.989
AIR TANKER BUSINESS.

01:29:22.056 --> 01:29:23.091
AND WE'RE GOING TO JUST PUT

01:29:23.157 --> 01:29:24.492
BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND HAVE

01:29:24.559 --> 01:29:26.828
HELICOPTERS WITH BUCKETS

01:29:26.894 --> 01:29:27.128
[inaudible]

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:27.762
CAN [inaudible]

01:29:27.829 --> 01:29:29.530
ANYBODY [inaudible]

01:29:29.597 --> 01:29:32.500
ENLIGHTEN ME.

01:29:32.567 --> 01:29:34.335
PROBABLY NOT LET ME GO TO CENTER

01:29:34.402 --> 01:29:35.803
NIELSEN AND THEN BACK TO MR TING

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:37.572
CENTER NIELSEN.

01:29:37.638 --> 01:29:40.041
WE CAN'T JUST BLITHELY SAY THAT.

01:29:40.108 --> 01:29:42.643
THE FIXED WING AIRCRAFT ARE NOT

01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:44.445
APPROPRIATE FOR THE TIMES THEY

01:29:44.512 --> 01:29:45.747
ARE ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR THE

01:29:45.813 --> 01:29:47.682
TIMES.

01:29:47.749 --> 01:29:49.183
AND HAVING BEEN VERY CLOSE TO

01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:51.319
THIS FOR LITERALLY DECADES THE

01:29:51.385 --> 01:29:54.622
FLEET IS IN TROUBLE.

01:29:54.689 --> 01:29:55.723
AND WE DO NEED.

01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:56.357
TO AND THESE PLANES ARE COMING

01:29:56.424 --> 01:29:58.159
AT LITTLE COST BUT WE DO HAVE TO

01:29:58.226 --> 01:29:59.927
HAVE.

01:29:59.994 --> 01:30:02.063
THE THE BEEFING UP OF THE FLEET

01:30:02.130 --> 01:30:04.966
MEETING THE RESILIENCE QUALITY.

01:30:05.032 --> 01:30:06.701
THE SAFETY.

01:30:06.768 --> 01:30:07.935
AND WE DEFINITELY NEED THE

01:30:08.002 --> 01:30:10.605
TRAINING.

01:30:10.671 --> 01:30:11.873
I DON'T MIND SOME LANGUAGE HERE

01:30:11.939 --> 01:30:15.409
BUT THIS IS REALLY CRITICAL TO

01:30:15.476 --> 01:30:18.579
OUR ABILITIES TO RESPOND.

01:30:18.646 --> 01:30:20.081
THERE ARE MOMENTARY

01:30:20.148 --> 01:30:21.716
CIRCUMSTANCES WE SAW ON THIS

01:30:21.783 --> 01:30:23.484
JUST THE LAST YEAR WE'RE BECAUSE

01:30:23.551 --> 01:30:25.286
OF SMOKE.

01:30:25.353 --> 01:30:26.721
SOME OF THOSE FIXED WINGS COULD

01:30:26.788 --> 01:30:29.390
NOT BE DEPLOYED.

01:30:29.457 --> 01:30:29.924
BUT WE NEED TO HAVE THEM

01:30:29.991 --> 01:30:30.691
AVAILABLE.

01:30:30.758 --> 01:30:31.692
AND NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH

01:30:31.759 --> 01:30:33.494
BECAUSE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE

01:30:33.561 --> 01:30:35.029
FIRES THAT WE'RE NOW DEALING

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:36.297
WITH SO I WOULD WANT TO MOVE THE

01:30:36.364 --> 01:30:39.734
SENATE VERSION.

01:30:39.801 --> 01:30:40.334
THANK YOU I THINK WE ALL AGREE

01:30:40.401 --> 01:30:43.638
THAT THE AIR FLEET IS AGING AND

01:30:43.704 --> 01:30:44.205
THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:45.873
ABOUT IT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.241
THE C. ONE FIFTIES THAT WE ARE

01:30:47.308 --> 01:30:49.243
RECEIVING IS THAT THEY'RE ABOUT

01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:50.945
FIFTY YEARS OLD IS THAT.

01:30:51.012 --> 01:30:52.647
CORRECT YOU KNOW THE AGE OF THE

01:30:52.713 --> 01:30:53.347
AIRCRAFT.

01:30:53.414 --> 01:30:54.916
I DON'T KNOW THE ACTUAL AGE OF

01:30:54.982 --> 01:30:56.484
THE ALL OF THE AIRCRAFT I THINK

01:30:56.551 --> 01:30:57.585
SOME OF THEM MAY BE DIFFERENT IN

01:30:57.652 --> 01:30:59.086
AGE THEIR SEVEN OF THEM IN TOTAL

01:30:59.153 --> 01:31:00.354
I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY WERE ALL

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:01.622
WHAT'S THE RANGE OF THE AGE.

01:31:01.689 --> 01:31:03.157
I'M NOT SURE OF TIME AND I CAN

01:31:03.224 --> 01:31:05.193
GET THAT INFORMATION A FIVE

01:31:05.259 --> 01:31:06.661
YEARS OLD TEN YEARS OLD I MEAN.

01:31:06.727 --> 01:31:07.695
I I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER AGAIN

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:09.197
ART ARE UNDERSTANDING THE

01:31:09.263 --> 01:31:11.232
PRESENTATION SUBCOMMITTEE THAT

01:31:11.299 --> 01:31:12.033
THEY WERE FIFTY YEARS OLD BUT

01:31:12.099 --> 01:31:15.469
WHAT'S THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF

01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:16.938
THE STARCRAFT OF THESE AIRCRAFT.

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:18.739
I DON'T KNOW THE LIFE EXPECTANCY

01:31:18.806 --> 01:31:19.440
I KNOW THAT.

01:31:19.507 --> 01:31:20.408
A NUMBER OF THE AIRCRAFT WERE

01:31:20.474 --> 01:31:21.375
ALREADY USING ARE KIND OF

01:31:21.442 --> 01:31:23.077
SIMILAR I KNOW THAT THE AIRFORCE

01:31:23.144 --> 01:31:24.245
IS DOING.

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:26.347
RETROFITS -- TO THESE AIRCRAFT

01:31:26.414 --> 01:31:28.149
SO THAT HELPS -- WITH THE WITH

01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:29.917
LIFE EXPECTANCY WE CAN GET THOSE

01:31:29.984 --> 01:31:31.118
AT THAT INFORMATION FOR YOU.

01:31:31.185 --> 01:31:32.887
AND UNDERSTOOD SIZE SO I THINK

01:31:32.954 --> 01:31:34.522
ARE ARE CONCERNED FROM.

01:31:34.589 --> 01:31:37.725
OUR HOUSE WAS WE TOTALLY AGREE

01:31:37.792 --> 01:31:39.493
THAT WE NEED TO AFRAID TO SLEEP --

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:40.595
THE QUESTION WAS IS THE FOR

01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:41.662
BRINGING AIR AIRCRAFT THAT'S AS

01:31:41.729 --> 01:31:43.497
OLD AS OUR OLD FLEET WHETHER

01:31:43.564 --> 01:31:45.066
THAT WAS ACTUALLY AN UPGRADE IN.

01:31:45.132 --> 01:31:46.434
WITH THAT WAS REALLY THE MOST

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:48.202
APPROPRIATE USE OF MONEY --

01:31:48.269 --> 01:31:50.171
TOTALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT

01:31:50.238 --> 01:31:51.672
WE'RE GETTING THIS FOR FREE.

01:31:51.739 --> 01:31:54.208
I THINK WE WANTED TO STEP BACK

01:31:54.275 --> 01:31:55.910
FOR A SECOND AND ASK THE THE

01:31:55.977 --> 01:31:57.778
BIGGER QUESTION WHICH IS.

01:31:57.845 --> 01:31:59.680
IS THIS REALLY -- ABOUT RATHER

01:31:59.747 --> 01:32:02.216
THAN SPENDING THE MONEY TO

01:32:02.283 --> 01:32:03.150
OPERATE.

01:32:03.217 --> 01:32:04.318
OLD PLANES SHOULD WE ACTUALLY BE

01:32:04.385 --> 01:32:07.088
TAKING MONEY GOING TO BUY NEW

01:32:07.154 --> 01:32:07.622
PLANES WHICH I KNOW WOULD

01:32:07.688 --> 01:32:07.989
OBVIOUSLY BE.

01:32:08.055 --> 01:32:10.157
COSTLIER BUT IN THE LONG RUN MAY

01:32:10.224 --> 01:32:12.894
BE THE BETTER FINANCIAL DECISION.

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.795
SO I THINK THAT WAS OUR CONCERN

01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:16.864
THAT WE WERE INHERITING FIFTY

01:32:16.931 --> 01:32:18.032
YEAR OLD PLANTS.

01:32:18.099 --> 01:32:20.201
THANK YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE.

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:25.273
THANK YOU I'M SURE I COULD

01:32:25.339 --> 01:32:25.907
PROBABLY SAID SHED SOME LIGHT ON

01:32:25.973 --> 01:32:27.875
THIS -- CRAFTER LIKE HOUSES

01:32:27.942 --> 01:32:28.676
THEY'RE NOT LIKE CARS SO IF YOU

01:32:28.743 --> 01:32:29.844
TOTALLY REFURBISHED AIRCRAFT YOU

01:32:29.911 --> 01:32:30.645
CAN REALLY MAKE IT.

01:32:30.711 --> 01:32:32.046
LIKE A NEW AIRCRAFT AND THAT'S

01:32:32.113 --> 01:32:33.247
OFTEN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE

01:32:33.314 --> 01:32:34.282
SOLUTION IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE

01:32:34.348 --> 01:32:35.683
AIRFORCE IS DOING ON ITS LARGE

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:36.117
BOMBERS.

01:32:36.183 --> 01:32:38.219
THEY'RE REFURBISHING BE FIFTY

01:32:38.286 --> 01:32:40.021
TWOS THAT ARE FIFTY YEARS OLD --

01:32:40.087 --> 01:32:40.621
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S THE

01:32:40.688 --> 01:32:41.989
MOST COST OF WHAT EFFECTIVE WAY

01:32:42.056 --> 01:32:44.091
OF MEETING THAT MISSION SO IF

01:32:44.158 --> 01:32:44.725
I'M SURE THAT THEY HAVE CRUNCH

01:32:44.792 --> 01:32:46.160
THE NUMBERS AND IF THEY'RE

01:32:46.227 --> 01:32:47.595
SATISFIED WITH THAT DECISION I'M

01:32:47.662 --> 01:32:49.330
HIGHLY CONFIDENT THAT THE C. ONE

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:50.765
THIRTIES CAN BE.

01:32:50.831 --> 01:32:51.632
RETURNED TO A CONDITION THAT'S

01:32:51.699 --> 01:32:53.167
GOING TO SERVE THE STATE OF

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:54.335
CALIFORNIA FOR MANY YEARS -- I

01:32:54.402 --> 01:32:56.504
DO SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF

01:32:56.570 --> 01:32:57.838
THE ASSEMBLY ABOUT.

01:32:57.905 --> 01:33:00.308
WHETHER OR NOT A LARGE FLEET OF

01:33:00.374 --> 01:33:02.276
C. ONE THIRTIES IS GOING TO HELP

01:33:02.343 --> 01:33:03.177
US IN OUR FIRE FIGHTING MISSION

01:33:03.244 --> 01:33:04.979
BUT I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY THE

01:33:05.046 --> 01:33:07.048
DIRECTION WE NEED TO MOVE AND SO --

01:33:07.114 --> 01:33:08.516
I WOULD SUPPORT.

01:33:08.582 --> 01:33:10.584
EITHER THE SENATE'S PROPOSAL OR

01:33:10.651 --> 01:33:11.953
AT THE VERY LEAST THE LA --

01:33:12.019 --> 01:33:16.590
COMPROMISE THAT WOULD GIVE US

01:33:16.657 --> 01:33:17.224
SOME FUNDING TO GET THAT PROGRAM

01:33:17.291 --> 01:33:18.993
RULING.

01:33:19.060 --> 01:33:20.094
THANK YOU SO MUCH ANY OTHER US

01:33:20.161 --> 01:33:21.462
INTO NIELSEN WELL I WOULD I'D

01:33:21.529 --> 01:33:23.197
LIKE TO ADD THAT.

01:33:23.264 --> 01:33:23.898
ALL THE EGGS ARE NOT IN THE C.

01:33:23.965 --> 01:33:24.699
ONE FORTY BASKET.

01:33:24.765 --> 01:33:26.500
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE'VE.

01:33:26.567 --> 01:33:29.403
EMBARKED ON SOME HELICOPTERS.

01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:31.172
TO A GREAT CAPACITY.

01:33:31.238 --> 01:33:33.307
THEY ARE YOU THEY HAVE A UTILITY

01:33:33.374 --> 01:33:35.676
AND DIFFERENT AREAS AND SOME

01:33:35.743 --> 01:33:37.411
PLACES WHERE THESE FIXED WING

01:33:37.478 --> 01:33:38.879
CANNOT OPERATE.

01:33:38.946 --> 01:33:40.147
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT CAL FIRE IN

01:33:40.214 --> 01:33:42.183
ITS ENTIRETY IT RELATES TO THE

01:33:42.249 --> 01:33:43.017
IN.

01:33:43.084 --> 01:33:44.685
ALL OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT THEY

01:33:44.752 --> 01:33:46.487
USE THE GROUND EQUIPMENT THE

01:33:46.554 --> 01:33:47.755
ENGINES.

01:33:47.822 --> 01:33:49.390
THE SUPPORT EQUIPMENT ON THE

01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:51.192
GROUND AND OF COURSE THE YEAR AS

01:33:51.258 --> 01:33:52.393
WELL.

01:33:52.460 --> 01:33:54.362
AND THIS THIS IS A A GOOD STEP

01:33:54.428 --> 01:33:55.997
IN A IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND

01:33:56.063 --> 01:33:57.898
I WOULD ARGUE VERY VOCIFEROUSLY

01:33:57.965 --> 01:34:00.368
AT AT A VERY CRITICAL TIMING

01:34:00.434 --> 01:34:02.670
MOMENT BECAUSE THE MAGNITUDE OF

01:34:02.737 --> 01:34:04.138
THE FIRES WERE NOW AFTER HAVING

01:34:04.205 --> 01:34:05.973
TO FACE.

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.174
CENTER OFF.

01:34:07.241 --> 01:34:09.110
I WILL ALSO IN A MEANS OF THE

01:34:09.176 --> 01:34:10.644
FACT THAT THE THE AIR FORCE

01:34:10.711 --> 01:34:12.480
STILL USES THE C. ONE THIRTY

01:34:12.546 --> 01:34:14.015
PLATFORM FOR THE FIRE FIGHTING

01:34:14.081 --> 01:34:15.783
MISSION IN VARIOUS.

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:18.619
VERSIONS -- INDICATES TO ME THAT

01:34:18.686 --> 01:34:20.521
IT MUST BE A FAIRLY EFFECTIVE

01:34:20.588 --> 01:34:22.023
PLATFORM TO DELIVER.

01:34:22.089 --> 01:34:24.325
A FIRE RETARDANT AND IS PROBABLY

01:34:24.392 --> 01:34:26.027
SOME ADVANTAGE TO HAVE A A

01:34:26.093 --> 01:34:26.927
SYSTEM THAT'S COMPATIBLE WITH

01:34:26.994 --> 01:34:29.630
THE THE MILITARY WHEN WE DO CALL

01:34:29.697 --> 01:34:31.332
THE MILITARY IN TO HELP --

01:34:31.399 --> 01:34:32.933
SOMEWHAT COMPATIBLE ANYWAY --

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:34.602
IT'S PROBABLY AN ADVANTAGE THERE

01:34:34.668 --> 01:34:36.670
AND I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT --

01:34:36.737 --> 01:34:40.341
WHEN I WAS -- IN THE SERVICE.

01:34:40.408 --> 01:34:41.475
THERE WAS A OF THE C. ONE THIRTY

01:34:41.542 --> 01:34:43.411
PLATFORM AND IT'S VARIATIONS IN

01:34:43.477 --> 01:34:46.213
THEIR MANY OF THEM WAS PART OF A

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:49.316
FAIRLY RIGOROUS -- A PROGRAM TO

01:34:49.383 --> 01:34:51.786
A TO RE HAVE BEEN AND INSURE

01:34:51.852 --> 01:34:53.054
THAT THE WING STRUCTURE THE BOX

01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:56.390
STRUCTURE -- WAS WAS SUITABLE

01:34:56.457 --> 01:34:58.526
FOR MILITARY TACTICAL AIRLIFT

01:34:58.592 --> 01:35:00.161
OPERATIONS WHICH ARE THE THE

01:35:00.227 --> 01:35:01.662
MOST US PASSED ONE OF THE MOST

01:35:01.729 --> 01:35:03.764

01:35:05.299 --> 01:35:06.100
FLEET.

01:35:06.167 --> 01:35:07.201
AND MOST OF THE AIRFORCE

01:35:07.268 --> 01:35:10.438
AIRPLANES UNFORTUNATELY ARE OVER

01:35:10.504 --> 01:35:11.806
FIFTY YEARS OLD SO I I WOULDN'T

01:35:11.872 --> 01:35:13.140
I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM

01:35:13.207 --> 01:35:15.943

COMMENTS CENTER NIELSEN

01:44:57.391 --> 01:44:57.624
[inaudible]

01:44:57.691 --> 01:44:58.492
ANALYSTS.

01:44:58.558 --> 01:45:00.827
THIS WILL RESULT IN MORE

01:45:00.894 --> 01:45:03.630
ACQUIRING OF LANCE.

01:45:03.697 --> 01:45:05.399
AND HAS THE BILL OVER THE

01:45:05.465 --> 01:45:07.668
DECADES A PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA

01:45:07.734 --> 01:45:09.569
OF ACQUIRING LANDS INDOOR

01:45:09.636 --> 01:45:11.038
CONVERSION INTO PARKS OR

01:45:11.104 --> 01:45:12.673
WHATEVER.

01:45:12.739 --> 01:45:13.740
THE STATE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO

01:45:13.807 --> 01:45:16.009
MAINTAIN THESE.

01:45:16.076 --> 01:45:17.544
THIS WOULD APPEAR TO BE A PRETTY

01:45:17.611 --> 01:45:19.780
BOLD PLAN.

01:45:19.846 --> 01:45:21.548
OF TAKING LANDS IN THE STATE

01:45:21.615 --> 01:45:23.550
AUTHORITY.

01:45:23.617 --> 01:45:25.886
BUT IS THERE A PLAN TO MAINTAIN

01:45:25.952 --> 01:45:28.055
THESE PLANTS.

01:45:28.121 --> 01:45:29.856
I THINK OFTEN MANY OF THESE

01:45:29.923 --> 01:45:32.492
GRANTS ARE -- FROM LAND TRUSTS

01:45:32.559 --> 01:45:34.428
OR OTHER NON NONPROFIT OR OTHER

01:45:34.494 --> 01:45:35.896
ENTITIES THAT APPLY FOR THE

01:45:35.962 --> 01:45:37.631
FUNDS IN ORDER TO DO THAT

01:45:37.698 --> 01:45:38.365
THROUGH A COMPETITIVE GRANT

01:45:38.432 --> 01:45:39.566
PROCESS THROUGH WILDLIFE

01:45:39.633 --> 01:45:41.068
CONSERVATION BOARD SO WHILE

01:45:41.134 --> 01:45:43.270
THERE MAY BE SOME CATEGORIES

01:45:43.336 --> 01:45:44.604
WHERE THE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL

01:45:44.671 --> 01:45:46.940
WILDLIFE OR THE STATE PARKS TAKE

01:45:47.007 --> 01:45:48.041
ON THE LAND I DON'T.

01:45:48.108 --> 01:45:49.142
THINK THAT'S EXCLUSIVE FOR ALL

01:45:49.209 --> 01:45:50.510
THESE I THINK MANY OF THEM ARE

01:45:50.577 --> 01:45:52.412
COMING FROM THE FIELD IF YOU

01:45:52.479 --> 01:45:56.016
WELL -- APPLYING TO TIP PUT LAB

01:45:56.083 --> 01:45:57.517
LAND IN CONSERVATION.

01:45:57.584 --> 01:45:58.785
AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE NOT

01:45:58.852 --> 01:46:00.120
MAINTAINED THAT IS A PROBLEM

01:46:00.187 --> 01:46:01.722
THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT

01:46:01.788 --> 01:46:03.356
THE STATE HAS STRUGGLED WITH FOR

01:46:03.423 --> 01:46:04.291
LANDS THAT ARE IN STATE

01:46:04.357 --> 01:46:05.792
OWNERSHIP ONGOING OPERATIONS AND

01:46:05.859 --> 01:46:09.996

[inaudible]

01:46:10.363 --> 01:46:15.335
QUESTION.

01:46:15.402 --> 01:46:17.003
THE NUMBER HOLD OF SADDAM OFTEN

01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:18.071
THANK YOU.

01:46:18.138 --> 01:46:19.673
MOVING ON TO ISSUE TWELVE CAP

01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:25.278
AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN.

01:46:25.345 --> 01:46:31.384
HELLO WHEN YOU'RE READY.

01:46:31.451 --> 01:46:32.719
ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

ANALYST'S OFFICE WE DO HAVE A

01:46:34.454 --> 01:46:35.856
HANDOUT ON THIS ISSUE THAT --

01:46:35.922 --> 01:46:37.090
HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE IN YOUR

01:46:37.157 --> 01:46:38.658
PACKETS ALL GO THROUGH THAT VERY

01:46:38.725 --> 01:46:40.727
BRIEFLY -- SO IF YOU TURN TO

01:46:40.794 --> 01:46:42.229
PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT.

01:46:42.295 --> 01:46:43.430
JUST PROVIDES A HIGH LEVEL

01:46:43.497 --> 01:46:44.598
OVERVIEW OF THE DIFFERENCES

01:46:44.664 --> 01:46:46.032
BETWEEN THE THREE DIFFERENT CAP

01:46:46.099 --> 01:46:47.167
AND TRADE.

01:46:47.234 --> 01:46:49.903
EXPENDITURE PACKAGES ON JUST THE

01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:52.305
REVENUES -- EXPENDITURE AMOUNTS

01:46:52.372 --> 01:46:54.808
AND THEN IN DEAR FUND BALANCES --

01:46:54.875 --> 01:46:56.243
SO A COUPLE THINGS TO HIGHLIGHT

01:46:56.309 --> 01:46:57.978
HERE ON THE REVENUES ABOUT THE

01:46:58.044 --> 01:46:59.179
SENATE AND ASSEMBLY ADOPTED AN

01:46:59.246 --> 01:47:00.714
ASSUMPTION OF HIGHER REVENUES IN

01:47:00.781 --> 01:47:03.717
THE IN THE GOVERNOR DID AND BOTH

01:47:03.784 --> 01:47:05.719
HOUSES ALSO ADOPTED -- SOMEWHAT

01:47:05.786 --> 01:47:07.888
HIGHER SPENDING -- THAN THE

01:47:07.954 --> 01:47:10.323
GOVERNOR DID -- SO THE SENATE

01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:12.092
ADOPTED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED

01:47:12.159 --> 01:47:14.227
MILLION DOLLARS MORE IN THE

01:47:14.294 --> 01:47:15.061
OVERALL SPENDING ON THE

01:47:15.128 --> 01:47:16.263
GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE THE ASSEMBLY

01:47:16.329 --> 01:47:17.864
IS ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

01:47:17.931 --> 01:47:18.965
DOLLARS MORE.

01:47:19.032 --> 01:47:20.167
AND YOU CAN KIND OF SEE THE THE

01:47:20.233 --> 01:47:22.502
AND FUND BALANCES UNDER UNDER

01:47:22.569 --> 01:47:23.069
THE DIFFERENT PLANS AND THE

01:47:23.136 --> 01:47:25.071
TABLE THERE -- SO JUST A COUPLE

01:47:25.138 --> 01:47:27.207
OF QUICK COMMENTS FIRST ON THE

01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:29.943
THE REVENUE -- WE ACTUALLY THINK

01:47:30.010 --> 01:47:30.877
BOTH THROUGH GOVERNOR'S REVENUE

01:47:30.944 --> 01:47:32.412
ASSUMPTIONS AS WELL AS THE

01:47:32.479 --> 01:47:33.847
HOUSES BOTH HOUSES REVENUE

01:47:33.914 --> 01:47:35.248
ASSUMPTIONS ARE REASONABLE THAT

01:47:35.315 --> 01:47:36.383
JUST KIND OF A DIFFERENCE IN.

01:47:36.449 --> 01:47:38.018
THE LEVEL OF RISK ASSOCIATED

01:47:38.084 --> 01:47:39.085
WITH THEM.

01:47:39.152 --> 01:47:40.854
BASICALLY THE GOVERNOR'S --

01:47:40.921 --> 01:47:43.723
ABSTINENCE ASSUME -- PRICES

01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:44.858
CONTINUE IT THE WAY THEY THEN

01:47:44.925 --> 01:47:46.526
ESSENTIALLY COLOR OVER THE LAST

01:47:46.593 --> 01:47:48.328
COUPLE OF YEARS WHERE AS BOTH.

01:47:48.395 --> 01:47:49.896
THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY ASSUME --

01:47:49.963 --> 01:47:51.464
THE MARKET FOR ALLOWANCES AND

01:47:51.531 --> 01:47:52.933
PRICES KIND OF CONTINUE AT THE

01:47:52.999 --> 01:47:55.602
WHAT WAS SEEN IN THE MOST RECENT

01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:56.837
AUCTIONS SO WE THINK FOR BOTH --

01:47:56.903 --> 01:47:58.772
REASONABLE BUT THE SENATE

01:47:58.839 --> 01:48:00.140
ASSEMBLY -- VERSIONS RICHEST

01:48:00.207 --> 01:48:02.275
SOMEWHAT MORE RISKY AND SO IT'S

01:48:02.342 --> 01:48:03.310
IMPORTANT TO KIND OF KEEP IN

01:48:03.376 --> 01:48:05.111
MIND ABOUT KIND OF HOW TO PLAN

01:48:05.178 --> 01:48:05.879
FOR THAT IF YOUR SIM IN SOMEONE

01:48:05.946 --> 01:48:07.180
HIGHER REVENUES GIVEN THE

01:48:07.247 --> 01:48:08.715
UNCERTAINTY IN REVENUES.

01:48:08.782 --> 01:48:10.050
COUPLE THINGS TO THINK ABOUT ONE

01:48:10.116 --> 01:48:11.351
THE FUN CONDITION THAT KIND OF

01:48:11.418 --> 01:48:12.219
THE OVERALL SIZE OF THE FUND

01:48:12.285 --> 01:48:15.222
CONDITION -- IN THE FUN

01:48:15.288 --> 01:48:16.656
CONDITIONS OVER BOTH HOUSES ARE

01:48:16.723 --> 01:48:18.358
ARE SOMEWHAT MODEST -- BUT THE

01:48:18.425 --> 01:48:19.693
ASSEMBLY IS A SLIGHTLY HIGHER --

01:48:19.759 --> 01:48:21.061
ALSO WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:48:21.127 --> 01:48:23.330
CONSIDER BOTH PLANS AS WELL AS

01:48:23.396 --> 01:48:24.865
THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN INCLUDE SOME

01:48:24.931 --> 01:48:26.099
BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THEY GIVE

01:48:26.166 --> 01:48:27.234
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SOME

01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:29.336
AUTHORITY. TO FOR CERTAIN

01:48:29.402 --> 01:48:36.309
PROGRAMS TO ADJUST THOSE

01:48:36.376 --> 01:48:38.144
ALLOCATIONS DOWN WORD OF REVENUE

01:48:38.211 --> 01:48:39.679
COMES IN LOWER THAN EXPECTED SO

01:48:39.746 --> 01:48:40.413
THAT'S A OUT ONE WAY TO CAN

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:41.081
MITIGATE AGAINST THE THE RISK OF

01:48:41.147 --> 01:48:42.515
LOWER THAN EXPECTED REVENUES.

01:48:42.582 --> 01:48:43.116
AND THEN THIRD THE FINAL ISSUE%

01:48:43.183 --> 01:48:44.017
IS JUST ONE THING ABOUT THE

01:48:44.084 --> 01:48:44.684
OVERALL PACKAGE IN THE AMOUNT OF

01:48:44.751 --> 01:48:45.418
SPENDING WE THINK IT'S ALSO

01:48:45.485 --> 01:48:46.253
IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND.

01:48:46.319 --> 01:48:46.887
OUT YOUR REVENUES IN THE LEVEL

01:48:46.953 --> 01:48:47.420
OF RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE

01:48:47.487 --> 01:48:48.755
AVAILABLE BEYOND THE BUDGET YEAR

01:48:48.822 --> 01:48:50.156
AND SO -- OUR VIEW OF KIND OF

01:48:50.223 --> 01:48:51.258
LOOKING AT THE OUT YEAR REVENUES

01:48:51.324 --> 01:48:53.026
THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT THE

01:48:53.093 --> 01:48:54.761
AMOUNT THAT'S AVAILABLE.

01:48:54.828 --> 01:48:56.196
FOR A DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES

01:48:56.263 --> 01:48:57.731
THAT ARE ALLOCATED IN THE BUDGET --

01:48:57.797 --> 01:48:59.032
WILL BE COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY

01:48:59.099 --> 01:49:00.200
LESS THAN KIND OF THE AMOUNT

01:49:00.267 --> 01:49:01.801
THAT'S IN THIS BUDGET AND SO

01:49:01.868 --> 01:49:04.471
THINKING ABOUT -- YEAH REVENUE

01:49:04.537 --> 01:49:05.472
THAT'S AVAILABLE COULD BE YOU

01:49:05.538 --> 01:49:06.806
KNOW AND AND THE RANGE OF A

01:49:06.873 --> 01:49:07.741
BILLION DOLLARS OR LASSEN THESE

01:49:07.807 --> 01:49:09.910
PACKAGES PROVIDE ABOUT ONE POINT

01:49:09.976 --> 01:49:11.344
FOUR BILLION AND SO THINKING

01:49:11.411 --> 01:49:11.978
ABOUT THAT WHEN YOU'RE THINKING

01:49:12.045 --> 01:49:13.513
ABOUT HOW MUCH.

01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:14.080
MONEY TO LEAVE IN THE FUND

01:49:14.147 --> 01:49:16.249
BALANCE FOR FOR FUTURE YEARS WE

01:49:16.316 --> 01:49:16.716
THINK IS AN IMPORTANT

01:49:16.783 --> 01:49:17.884
CONSIDERATION.

01:49:17.951 --> 01:49:21.354
SO -- PAGES TWO AND THREE OF THE

01:49:21.421 --> 01:49:22.322
HAND OUT.

01:49:22.389 --> 01:49:27.694
INCLUDE JUST A SUMMARY OF THE

01:49:27.761 --> 01:49:30.497
WE'LL GO OVER THOSE IN DETAIL --

01:49:30.563 --> 01:49:32.032
IN GENERAL WE JUST.

01:49:32.098 --> 01:49:33.066
ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:49:33.133 --> 01:49:35.335
ALLOCATE IN FUNDING ACCORDING TO

01:49:35.402 --> 01:49:35.902
ITS PRIORITIES AND DIFFERENT

01:49:35.969 --> 01:49:36.736
GOALS.

01:49:36.803 --> 01:49:39.806
A HIGH LEVEL THE ASSEMBLY --

01:49:39.873 --> 01:49:41.074
ALLOCATES MORE MONEY THAN THE

01:49:41.141 --> 01:49:43.043
SENATE DOES TO A COUPLE PROGRAMS

01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:44.511
LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION

01:49:44.577 --> 01:49:45.946
GENERALLY AND I SHOULD SAY.

01:49:46.012 --> 01:49:47.147
FORGET ABOUT THE ASSEMBLY

01:49:47.213 --> 01:49:49.516
PACKAGE -- ALLOCATES MONEY TO

01:49:49.582 --> 01:49:51.284
KIND OF GENERAL CATEGORIES OF

01:49:51.351 --> 01:49:52.953
PROGRAMS AND NOT -- SPECIFIC

01:49:53.019 --> 01:49:54.254
PROGRAMS I THINK WITH THE

01:49:54.321 --> 01:49:55.622
UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE --

01:49:55.689 --> 01:49:57.057
THOSE DETAILS WOULD BE WORKED

01:49:57.123 --> 01:49:58.959
OUT THROUGH THIS PROCESS -- SO

01:49:59.025 --> 01:50:00.527
THE ASSEMBLY ALLOCATES MORE THAN

01:50:00.593 --> 01:50:01.661
THE SENATE TO LOW CARBON

01:50:01.728 --> 01:50:04.297
TRANSPORTATION AND TOXIC ENTRY

01:50:04.364 --> 01:50:06.900
CRITERIA POLLUTANT PROGRAMS --

01:50:06.967 --> 01:50:08.134
OR AS THE SENATE -- TENDS TO

01:50:08.201 --> 01:50:10.670
PRIORITIZE -- FOR ITS --

01:50:10.737 --> 01:50:12.605

01:51:51.271 --> 01:51:52.705
ADDITIONAL SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS

01:51:52.772 --> 01:51:54.407

LAST PROPOSED THAT BEING SAID

01:51:56.443 --> 01:51:57.911
THAT LEVEL IS STILL TENS OF

01:51:57.977 --> 01:51:59.779
MILLIONS OR IN ONE CASE EVEN

THE REVENUES THAT WE EXPECT.

01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:11.458
AND THEN THE SECOND POINT THAT I

01:52:11.524 --> 01:52:13.493
WANT TO MAKE -- IN RELATION TO

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.195
THE LAST COMMENT FROM THE LA --

01:52:15.261 --> 01:52:16.596
REGARDING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

01:52:16.663 --> 01:52:17.997
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A KEY

01:52:18.064 --> 01:52:19.332
COMPONENT OR NEEDS TO BE A KEY

01:52:19.399 --> 01:52:21.134
COMPONENT OF TRANSITION TO A LOW

01:52:21.201 --> 01:52:22.602
CARBON ECONOMY AND SO IT IS IN A

01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:24.003
VERY IMPORTANT PART.

01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:24.871
OF THE GOVERNOR'S CAP AND TRADE

01:52:24.938 --> 01:52:28.408
PLAN AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO

01:52:28.475 --> 01:52:28.908
DISCUSSING THAT WITH YOU

THANK YOU.

OBERNOLTE.

01:52:34.180 --> 01:52:36.816
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- WANTED

01:52:36.883 --> 01:52:38.551
TO JUST DOUG GO OVER A COUPLE OF

01:52:38.618 --> 01:52:41.721
ITEMS HERE IF I IF I CAN -- I

01:52:41.788 --> 01:52:43.056
THINK.

01:52:43.123 --> 01:52:44.958
MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT WHAT WE

01:52:45.024 --> 01:52:45.959
START TO TALK ABOUT CAP AND

01:52:46.025 --> 01:52:48.094
TRADE IT IS A BIT OF A SENSITIVE

01:52:48.161 --> 01:52:50.196
SUBJECT. FOR ME IN FACT I STILL

01:52:50.263 --> 01:52:54.400
HAVE A SCHOLARS -- BECAUSE OF OF

01:52:54.467 --> 01:52:56.202
IT NOW THEY'RE ALL HEALED NOW

01:52:56.269 --> 01:52:57.504
BUT THERE IS SOME THAT'S WHY I

01:52:57.570 --> 01:53:00.406
LET YOU SPEAK FOR A THANK YOU --

01:53:00.473 --> 01:53:03.510
BUT THERE ARE SOME SOME SCHOLARS --

01:53:03.576 --> 01:53:06.546
AND ONE A KILLER -- ITEM THAT

01:53:06.613 --> 01:53:07.881
WAS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT WHEN WE

01:53:07.947 --> 01:53:09.849
DID THE NEGOTIATIONS -- WAS THE

01:53:09.916 --> 01:53:11.885
FINAL SUNDAY THAT -- AND RELIVE

01:53:11.951 --> 01:53:13.586
THE WHOLE THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE --

01:53:13.653 --> 01:53:15.121
BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAD

01:53:15.188 --> 01:53:16.923
FAILED TO DO NUMBERS TO EDUCATE

01:53:16.990 --> 01:53:18.892
FOLKS PRIOR TO THE DEAL BEING

01:53:18.958 --> 01:53:21.828
DONE -- AND IT WAS -- MONDAY HE

01:53:21.895 --> 01:53:23.563
A LATE MONDAY EVENING -- AND THE

01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:25.031
REASON WE DIDN'T GET OUT OF IT

01:53:25.098 --> 01:53:26.466
BEFORE THAT MONDAY EVENING WAS

01:53:26.533 --> 01:53:28.701
ON SUNDAY -- THERE WAS -- NIT

01:53:28.768 --> 01:53:31.371
FINAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH AG A TO

01:53:31.437 --> 01:53:32.472
MAKE SURE THAT THE MEMBERS THAT

01:53:32.539 --> 01:53:33.973
WE HAD IN OUR CAUCUS WE'RE GOING

01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:35.241
TO BE SUPPORT OF THE WHOLE

01:53:35.308 --> 01:53:36.976
CONCEPT WAS THAT AG HAD TO BE.

01:53:37.043 --> 01:53:38.478
A TAKEN CARE OF AND THE FARMER

01:53:38.545 --> 01:53:40.480
PROGRAM -- WHAT WHAT'S NOW THE

01:53:40.547 --> 01:53:44.050
FORMER PROGRAM WAS A BIG PIECE

01:53:44.117 --> 01:53:45.385
OF THAT PUZZLE?

01:53:45.451 --> 01:53:46.252
DURING THE INITIAL THE BUDGET

01:53:46.319 --> 01:53:47.754
THIS YEAR THAT WAS THE GOVERNOR

01:53:47.820 --> 01:53:48.755
SUBMITTED WAS TWENTY FIVE

01:53:48.821 --> 01:53:49.656
MILLION DOLLARS THE FORMER

01:53:49.722 --> 01:53:51.024
PROGRAM I BELIEVE NOW THE MAY

01:53:51.090 --> 01:53:51.925
REVISION.

01:53:51.991 --> 01:53:54.260
IT'S NINETY MILLION -- BUT THE

01:53:54.327 --> 01:53:56.629
LAST YEAR WAS A HUNDRED AND

01:53:56.696 --> 01:53:58.865
THIRTY FIVE MILLION AND AND ONE

01:53:58.932 --> 01:54:00.466
CARD IS DONE THEIR ANALYSIS IT

01:54:00.533 --> 01:54:02.502
IS STILL SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN

01:54:02.569 --> 01:54:03.269
WHAT THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS GONNA

01:54:03.336 --> 01:54:05.605
NEED. TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE

01:54:05.672 --> 01:54:07.140
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND

01:54:07.207 --> 01:54:09.075
OTHER CRITERIA POLLUTANTS IN

01:54:09.142 --> 01:54:11.277
REGARDS -- TO TO AG EQUIPMENT

01:54:11.344 --> 01:54:12.979
AND SO WHY ARE WE FUNDING IT AT

01:54:13.046 --> 01:54:14.747
LEAST A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MEN

01:54:14.814 --> 01:54:17.350
ON REALITY IT NEEDS TO BE MUCH.

01:54:17.417 --> 01:54:20.520
MUCH HIGHER.

01:54:20.587 --> 01:54:21.854
OF METAL ME DEPARTMENT OF

01:54:21.921 --> 01:54:24.924
FINANCE SO JUST FOR CONTEXT --

01:54:24.991 --> 01:54:26.359
LAST YEAR'S CAP AND TRADE

01:54:26.426 --> 01:54:28.261
PACKAGE WAS A ONE POINT FOUR

01:54:28.328 --> 01:54:29.662
BILLION DOLLAR.

01:54:29.729 --> 01:54:32.298
OVERALL PACKAGE IN AS THE ELLIE --

01:54:32.365 --> 01:54:36.502
CORRECTLY NOTED -- THE REVENUES

01:54:36.569 --> 01:54:38.071
FLUCTUATING KIND OVER TIME YOU

01:54:38.137 --> 01:54:39.372
KNOW THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE

01:54:39.439 --> 01:54:40.373
LESS.

01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:42.575
YOU KNOW IN OUT YEARS AND SO THE

01:54:42.642 --> 01:54:43.876
MAY REVISION PACKAGE.

01:54:43.943 --> 01:54:48.047
OVERALL WAS ONE POINT TWO FIVE

01:54:48.114 --> 01:54:49.849
BILLION DOLLARS SO.

01:54:49.916 --> 01:54:53.253
THE FARMER PROGRAM WHILE YOU'RE

01:54:53.319 --> 01:54:54.420
CORRECT IT IS LESS.

01:54:54.487 --> 01:54:55.922
IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT A LOT OF THE

01:54:55.989 --> 01:55:00.526
OTHER CATEGORIES ALSO -- ARE

01:55:00.593 --> 01:55:03.062
LESS COMPARED TO WHAT THEY WERE

01:55:03.129 --> 01:55:05.164
IN PRIOR YEARS SO -- WHAT I CAN

01:55:05.231 --> 01:55:06.833
JUST SAY IS IS THE THAT

01:55:06.899 --> 01:55:07.800
PARTICULAR PROGRAMME WASN'T

01:55:07.867 --> 01:55:09.636
SINGLED OUT IN FOR OR OR

01:55:09.702 --> 01:55:11.638
ANYTHING LIKE THAT THERE IS --

01:55:11.704 --> 01:55:13.439
THE AB SIX SEVENTEEN THE PROGRAM

01:55:13.506 --> 01:55:15.341
FOR EXAMPLE LAST YEAR IS TWO

01:55:15.408 --> 01:55:16.609
FIFTY THIS YEAR IT'S TWO HUNDRED

01:55:16.676 --> 01:55:18.411
THERE'S SOME OTHER EXAMPLES IT

01:55:18.478 --> 01:55:19.846
JUST REFLECTS THE FACT THAT AS

01:55:19.912 --> 01:55:21.447
AN OVERALL PACKAGE.

01:55:21.514 --> 01:55:23.850
THERE'S LESS AVAILABLE AND OF

01:55:23.916 --> 01:55:24.784
GET.

01:55:24.851 --> 01:55:26.519
YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN WHICH

01:55:26.586 --> 01:55:29.122
IS THE ACT DIESEL REPLACEMENT

01:55:29.188 --> 01:55:30.657
CHECKS A LOT OF BOXES AND TURNS

01:55:30.723 --> 01:55:33.092
TO GHG REDUCTIONS IN TERMS OF

01:55:33.159 --> 01:55:35.962
REDUCTIONS IN DISADVANTAGED

01:55:36.029 --> 01:55:37.096
COMMUNITIES. FOR THOSE

01:55:37.163 --> 01:55:38.431
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOSTLY

01:55:38.498 --> 01:55:40.366
IMPACTED AS WELL AS BENEFITING

01:55:40.433 --> 01:55:42.468
THE AG SECTOR SO -- WE DO THINK

01:55:42.535 --> 01:55:43.870
IT'S AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM WHICH

01:55:43.936 --> 01:55:45.238
IS WHY WE HAVE UCH A STRONG

01:55:45.305 --> 01:55:47.940
INVESTMENT BUT IT JUST REFLECTS

01:55:48.007 --> 01:55:48.408
THE AMOUNT OF OVERALL

01:55:48.474 --> 01:55:50.109
AVAILABILITY.

01:55:50.176 --> 01:55:52.378
AND YET WE WERE STILL ADDING IN

01:55:52.445 --> 01:55:53.813
NEW PROGRAMS AS WELL.

01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.682
INTO THIS WAS A JUST A TWENTY

01:55:55.748 --> 01:55:56.582
SEVEN MILLION I MIGHT HAVE

01:55:56.649 --> 01:55:58.718
MISSED THAT SO I'LL SPEAK

01:55:58.785 --> 01:56:00.486
BRIEFLY THEN MAC INFO ON THIS.

01:56:00.553 --> 01:56:02.355
ONE NEW PROPOSAL IS THIRTY FIVE

01:56:02.422 --> 01:56:04.424
MILLION DOLLARS IT'S VERY

01:56:04.490 --> 01:56:05.625
DIFFERENT IN THE SENSE THAT

01:56:05.692 --> 01:56:07.060
THERE ARE THE OTHER PROPOSALS IN

01:56:07.126 --> 01:56:08.394
OUR CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM DO NOT

01:56:08.461 --> 01:56:10.296
HAVE THAT DIRECT FOCUS ON

01:56:10.363 --> 01:56:11.664
TRANSITION TO A LOW CARBON

01:56:11.731 --> 01:56:13.132
ECONOMY FOR WORK FORCE WITH AN

01:56:13.199 --> 01:56:14.634
EMPHASIS ON DISADVANTAGED

01:56:14.701 --> 01:56:16.302
COMMUNITIES BUT AS MATT.

01:56:16.369 --> 01:56:17.670
MENTIONED THE OVERALL PACKAGE IS

01:56:17.737 --> 01:56:21.808
OVER A BILLION DOLLARS OF THIS

01:56:21.874 --> 01:56:23.276
IS ABOUT 3% OF THE OVERALL.

01:56:23.343 --> 01:56:24.243
OKAY.

01:56:24.310 --> 01:56:25.545
AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE MORE

01:56:25.611 --> 01:56:26.412
DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT AND

01:56:26.479 --> 01:56:28.548
THERE'S ONE OTHER ITEM.

01:56:28.614 --> 01:56:30.350
IN LOOKING AT THIS IN REGARDS TO

01:56:30.416 --> 01:56:31.417
FOREST'S.

01:56:31.484 --> 01:56:33.152
THERE'S TWO HUNDRED MILLION FROM

01:56:33.219 --> 01:56:34.354
THE GOVERNOR TWO HUNDRED MILLION

01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:35.722
FROM THE SENATE I THOUGHT THE

01:56:35.788 --> 01:56:37.156
GOVERNOR WAS PROPOSING.

01:56:37.223 --> 01:56:39.359
NOT TO UNDERMINE WITH THREE

01:56:39.425 --> 01:56:40.326
HUNDRED MILLION IS THAT GENERAL

01:56:40.393 --> 01:56:43.730
FUND OR OR OR DID I DID I

01:56:43.796 --> 01:56:45.465
MISUNDERSTAND THIS IS BACK IN

01:56:45.531 --> 01:56:46.733
FEBRUARY.

01:56:46.799 --> 01:56:48.634
TALKING ABOUT THAT WE HAD TO TO

01:56:48.701 --> 01:56:50.803
DO MORE INVESTMENT. FOR FOR FOR

01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:52.472
HEALTHY FORESTS -- I THOUGHT

01:56:52.538 --> 01:56:55.441
WITH WE'RE GONNA LOOK INTO A

01:56:55.508 --> 01:56:56.342
MILLION TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION

01:56:56.409 --> 01:56:56.642
[inaudible]

01:56:56.709 --> 01:56:58.244
THE THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:56:58.311 --> 01:56:59.912
PROPOSAL OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION

01:56:59.979 --> 01:57:03.049
IS A CONSISTENT WITH A SB NINE A

01:57:03.116 --> 01:57:04.550
ONE A FRAMEWORK OF TWO HUNDRED

01:57:04.617 --> 01:57:05.451
MILLION.

01:57:05.518 --> 01:57:07.253
ON AN ONGOING BASIS NOW THAT

01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:08.588
ISN'T TO SAY THAT THERE AREN'T.

01:57:08.654 --> 01:57:11.557
OTHER INVESTMENTS IN THE

01:57:11.624 --> 01:57:13.826
FORESTRY FORCED HEALTH AREA IT'S

01:57:13.893 --> 01:57:15.128
A PORTFOLIO APPROACH AS WE

01:57:15.194 --> 01:57:16.696
TALKED ABOUT THE C. ONE THIRTIES

01:57:16.763 --> 01:57:18.564
WE TALKED ABOUT ADDITIONAL

01:57:18.631 --> 01:57:19.632
ENGINES.

01:57:19.699 --> 01:57:22.602
THE YEAR ROUND ENGINES ALSO HAS

01:57:22.668 --> 01:57:23.803
A FIRE PREVENTION.

01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:25.872
OF BENEFIT IN THE SENSE THAT

01:57:25.938 --> 01:57:27.774
WHEN IT'S OFF OF A OFF PEAK

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:29.242
SEASON THEY'RE ALSO DOING

01:57:29.308 --> 01:57:31.544
ADDITIONAL FUEL REDUCTION WORK.

01:57:31.611 --> 01:57:33.045
SO IT'S KIND OF A A PORTFOLIO

01:57:33.112 --> 01:57:34.447
APPROACH BUT IN TERMS OF THE CAP

01:57:34.514 --> 01:57:36.582
AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN

01:57:36.649 --> 01:57:37.717
THAT'S REALLY TWO HUNDRED

01:57:37.784 --> 01:57:38.151
MILLION.

01:57:38.217 --> 01:57:39.585
OKAY AND THEN DEFINING MADAM

01:57:39.652 --> 01:57:40.353
CHAIR OF THE ONE THING IF I

01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:42.021
COULD ADVOCATE FOR HIS ANY

01:57:42.088 --> 01:57:43.122
FLEXIBILITY IN THIS AT ALL OF

01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:45.391
THE IF WE COULD INCREASE THAT

01:57:45.458 --> 01:57:45.625
FARMER.

01:57:45.691 --> 01:57:48.261
A FARMER AMOUNT.

01:57:48.327 --> 01:57:50.563
SIR -- MR OBERNOLTE FOLLOWED BY

01:57:50.630 --> 01:57:51.798

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO I'D

01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:56.836
LIKE TO TAKE YOU BACK ON THE

01:57:56.903 --> 01:57:58.938
COMMENTS MADE BY MY COLLEAGUE ON

01:57:59.005 --> 01:58:00.473
FOREST'S BECAUSE I WHEN I SERVED

01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:01.941
ON BUDGETS OF THREE I WAS ALWAYS

01:58:02.008 --> 01:58:02.809
AMAZED.

01:58:02.875 --> 01:58:03.509
AT THE DIFFERENCE THE

01:58:03.576 --> 01:58:04.644
DEFICIENCIES WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

01:58:04.710 --> 01:58:06.379
USE OF G. G. R. F. MONEY IF YOU

01:58:06.446 --> 01:58:07.747
LOOK AT THE TO FIND EFFICIENCY

01:58:07.814 --> 01:58:09.982
AS HOW MANY TONS OF CARBON CAN

01:58:10.049 --> 01:58:13.019
WE REDUCE FOR A GIVEN DOLLAR

01:58:13.085 --> 01:58:13.352
THAT WE SPEND.

01:58:13.419 --> 01:58:15.054
BY.

01:58:15.121 --> 01:58:15.755
FUELS REDUCTION WITH AND

01:58:15.822 --> 01:58:17.690
ENFORCED INITIATIVES WERE ALWAYS

01:58:17.757 --> 01:58:19.459
NEAR THE TOP OF THAT LIST.

01:58:19.525 --> 01:58:20.059
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T

01:58:20.126 --> 01:58:21.527
REALIZE.

01:58:21.594 --> 01:58:22.995
THAT A LARGE FOREST FIRE

01:58:23.062 --> 01:58:24.230
REPRESENTS A HUGE DE

01:58:24.297 --> 01:58:26.466
SEQUESTRATION OF CARBON DIOXIDE

01:58:26.532 --> 01:58:29.001
AND THAT ONE FOREST FIRE CAN

01:58:29.068 --> 01:58:30.403
WIPE OUT ALL THE RESTORE CARBON

01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:31.871
REDUCTION EFFORTS AND THROUGHOUT

01:58:31.938 --> 01:58:33.206
THE ENTIRE STATE.

01:58:33.272 --> 01:58:34.974
THE IN IN -- ONE OF THAT FOR THE

01:58:35.041 --> 01:58:36.909
FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR SO I REALLY

01:58:36.976 --> 01:58:38.578
VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE USE OF DID

01:58:38.644 --> 01:58:40.079
YOU ARE A FUNDS FOR THAT AND

01:58:40.146 --> 01:58:40.980
ALSO I THINK THEY'RE CONGRUENT

01:58:41.047 --> 01:58:42.248
WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT.

01:58:42.315 --> 01:58:44.283
STATE PRIORITIES NOT THE LEAST

01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:46.052
OF WHICH IS -- WHEN THE WITH THE

01:58:46.118 --> 01:58:47.787
THE YOU UTILITY PROBLEMS SB NINE

01:58:47.854 --> 01:58:48.955
ONE WE'RE HAVING OBVIOUSLY BUT

01:58:49.021 --> 01:58:50.490
ALSO AIR QUALITY BECAUSE THAT

01:58:50.556 --> 01:58:51.591
BLACK CARBON THAT?

01:58:51.657 --> 01:58:52.892
GETS SUBMITTED BY THOSE FOREST

01:58:52.959 --> 01:58:54.927
FIRES IS -- IN A REALLY THE MOST

01:58:54.994 --> 01:58:56.095
DESTRUCTIVE THING FOR QUALITY

01:58:56.162 --> 01:59:00.967
THAT WITH THAT -- THAT OCCURS SO --

01:59:01.033 --> 01:59:02.034
THE I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO

01:59:02.101 --> 01:59:02.502
CONSIDER.

01:59:02.568 --> 01:59:04.570
A LEVEL OF EXPENDITURE CLOSER TO

01:59:04.637 --> 01:59:06.038
THE SENATE VERSION DOWN WHAT THE

01:59:06.105 --> 01:59:07.607
ADMINISTRATION HAS PROPOSED OR

01:59:07.673 --> 01:59:09.442
WHAT THE ASSEMBLY HAS PROPOSED.

01:59:09.509 --> 01:59:11.110
IN THAT RESPECT.

01:59:11.177 --> 01:59:13.145
I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT -- THE

01:59:13.212 --> 01:59:14.914
PLACEHOLDER PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE

01:59:14.981 --> 01:59:16.482
THE TO THE ASSEMBLY VERSION I

01:59:16.549 --> 01:59:17.283
WONDER IF SOMEONE COULD TALK

01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.984
ABOUT.

01:59:18.050 --> 01:59:19.685
WHAT EXACTLY THE INTENT IS WITH

01:59:19.752 --> 01:59:21.053
THAT BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A BIT

01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:22.822
OF CONFUSION?

01:59:22.889 --> 01:59:25.057
AND THAT'S THAT'S PROBABLY --

01:59:25.124 --> 01:59:25.691
NOT FOR THE DEAL WELL MAYBE THE

01:59:25.758 --> 01:59:28.794

THERE.

02:00:01.561 --> 02:00:03.129
IS SOME INTENT LANGUAGE THAT

02:00:03.195 --> 02:00:05.698

CONSIDERED AN SORT OF THIS --

02:02:03.649 --> 02:02:05.251
THIS A GENERAL DISCUSSION AROUND

02:02:05.317 --> 02:02:07.253
DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES.

02:02:07.319 --> 02:02:11.023
THANK YOU MISTER BROWN BECAUSE I

02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:12.425

AT THAT CLEAR TITLE WITH I CAN

02:02:13.626 --> 02:02:14.360
ASK MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS.

02:02:14.427 --> 02:02:14.927
SO NOW THAT I KNOW OUR HIGH

02:02:14.994 --> 02:02:16.595
SPEED RAIL IS AT THE TAKES CARE

02:02:16.662 --> 02:02:20.766
OF THAT -- BUT THE SERMON

02:02:20.833 --> 02:02:21.667
OBERNOLTE.

02:02:21.734 --> 02:02:23.335
KIND OF ASKED THE QUESTION I

02:02:23.402 --> 02:02:25.104
WANTED TO ASK BUT MAYBE OVER FOR

02:02:25.171 --> 02:02:27.640
DO A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY -- PART

02:02:27.707 --> 02:02:31.210

POWER LINES.

02:02:38.217 --> 02:02:40.119
NOT IN THE CONTINUOUS

02:02:40.186 --> 02:02:41.854
APPROPRIATIONS.

02:02:41.921 --> 02:02:43.589
SO WHERE IS IT IN THE

DISCRETIONARY.

02:02:45.691 --> 02:02:47.059

VARIETY OF PIECES RELATED KIND

02:03:00.239 --> 02:03:01.941

02:03:02.007 --> 02:03:04.510
I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY OF THOSE

02:03:04.577 --> 02:03:06.045
KIND OF SPECIFIC PIECES

02:10:34.626 --> 02:10:36.495
DIESEL POWERED ARE FROM THE

02:10:36.562 --> 02:10:38.564
PARTICULAR MATTER POINT OF VIEW

02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:41.166
THE MOST SERIOUS ONE AND IF SO

02:10:41.233 --> 02:10:43.502
IF PART OF OUR OBJECTIVE IS NOT

02:10:43.569 --> 02:10:46.338
ONLY. TO GET OUT OUR CLIMATE

02:10:46.405 --> 02:10:49.208
PROTECTION GOALS BUT AS OUR AB

02:10:49.274 --> 02:10:49.808
THIRTY TWO LANGUAGE IN EVERY

02:10:49.875 --> 02:10:54.313
SUBSEQUENT WE ALSO INCORPORATE.

02:10:54.379 --> 02:10:55.581
THE AIR QUALITY.

02:10:55.647 --> 02:10:57.749
THE IT PUTS THEN.

02:10:57.816 --> 02:11:01.320
THE THE ROLE OF OUR CLEANING UP

02:11:01.386 --> 02:11:03.055
OR TRANSPORTATION FLEETS.

02:11:03.121 --> 02:11:05.357
NO PUTS OUT A PRETTY HIGH

02:11:05.424 --> 02:11:05.624
PRIORITY.

02:11:05.691 --> 02:11:10.896
AND WHAT AID IS BENNY CONTINUOUS --

02:11:10.963 --> 02:11:12.164
SECOND OMINOUS SAY CONTINUES

02:11:12.231 --> 02:11:14.066
TWICE NO SORT OF AGGREGATION ME

02:11:14.132 --> 02:11:15.834
THAT WE DO NOT HAVE CONTINUOUS

02:11:15.901 --> 02:11:17.536
APPROPRIATION IN THOSE TWO

02:11:17.603 --> 02:11:21.640
CATEGORIES THAT WE WOULD THAT WE

02:11:21.707 --> 02:11:22.808
DON'T SEE THOSE AS ESSENTIAL

02:11:22.874 --> 02:11:24.476
THINGS THAT SHOULD BE IN

02:11:24.543 --> 02:11:26.211
CONTINUOUS PREPARATION NOW.

02:11:26.278 --> 02:11:27.579
THAT IS SOMETHING I THINK BOTH

02:11:27.646 --> 02:11:28.780
OF OUR HOUSES SHOULD ALWAYS

02:11:28.847 --> 02:11:30.082
SHOULD BE CONSIDERING FOR THE

02:11:30.148 --> 02:11:33.752
FUTURE -- BUT I APPRECIATE THE

02:11:33.819 --> 02:11:36.521
ASSEMBLY OVERALL INCREASE IN

02:11:36.588 --> 02:11:38.957
THAT CATEGORY AND WHILE THEY

02:11:39.024 --> 02:11:41.493
DIDN'T BREAK IT OUT.

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:43.328
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

02:11:43.395 --> 02:11:45.764
AN INCREASE IN BOTH OVER THE

02:11:45.831 --> 02:11:47.733
WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDING

02:11:47.799 --> 02:11:49.301
SO CLOSER TO THE SENATE FOR

02:11:49.368 --> 02:11:50.202
HIGHER.

02:11:50.269 --> 02:11:52.537
DEPENDING ON WHAT WE LAND.

02:11:52.604 --> 02:11:55.374
ON BOTH THE CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE.

02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:58.777
AND ON THE CLEAN TRUCKS AND

02:11:58.844 --> 02:12:00.245
BUSES THAT WHAT WE CALL THE

02:12:00.312 --> 02:12:03.448
HEAVY AND MEDIUM DUTY VEHICLES.

02:12:03.515 --> 02:12:05.651
AND ON THE CLEAN VEHICLES -- I

02:12:05.717 --> 02:12:07.853
THINK IT'S ALSO WORTH IT GIVEN

02:12:07.919 --> 02:12:09.788
THAT THERE'S MANY MORE ELECTRIC

02:12:09.855 --> 02:12:11.890
VEHICLES ON THE MARKET THEIR

02:12:11.957 --> 02:12:14.526
RANGES EXPANDING THAT WE LOOK AT

02:12:14.593 --> 02:12:15.961
INCREASING.

02:12:16.028 --> 02:12:18.864
THE WHAT THE RANGE MILEAGES FOR

02:12:18.930 --> 02:12:20.766
OUR REBATE PROGRAM RIGHT NOW

02:12:20.832 --> 02:12:23.235
IT'S AT TWENTY AND MILES IN WE

02:12:23.302 --> 02:12:24.770
MIGHT CONSIDER TWENTY FIVE OR

02:12:24.836 --> 02:12:28.240
SLIGHTLY HIGHER WE WOULD CAPTURE --

02:12:28.307 --> 02:12:29.675
A GOOD AMOUNT OF THE VEHICLES

02:12:29.741 --> 02:12:31.009
THAT ARE ON THE MARKET BUT WE

02:12:31.076 --> 02:12:32.577
WOULD ALSO BE INCENTIVIZING

02:12:32.644 --> 02:12:35.314
THOSE THAT WERE REALLY GETTING.

02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:38.650
A GOOD -- I DO A GOOD INVESTMENT

02:12:38.717 --> 02:12:41.420
FOR IN TERMS OF RANGE IN SUCH --

02:12:41.486 --> 02:12:45.324
BUT ON THE ON THE OFF ROAD WE'VE

02:12:45.390 --> 02:12:47.893
ALWAYS HAD IT AT A MUCH LOWER.

02:12:47.959 --> 02:12:50.429
OR RATHER IN THE THE MEDIUM AND

02:12:50.495 --> 02:12:52.364
HEAVY DUTY WE'VE ALWAYS FUNDED

02:12:52.431 --> 02:12:56.068
THAT AT A LOWER LEVEL THEN THE

02:12:56.134 --> 02:12:57.703
PASSENGER VEHICLE.

02:12:57.769 --> 02:13:00.405
AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO

02:13:00.472 --> 02:13:02.708
START MAKING IT ON PAR AND PART

02:13:02.774 --> 02:13:04.176
OF THAT IS THAT.

02:13:04.242 --> 02:13:06.278
THAT CATEGORY VEHICLES THEIR

02:13:06.345 --> 02:13:08.914
TURNOVER IS FASTER PASSED WE WE

02:13:08.980 --> 02:13:10.749
INDIVIDUALS DON'T BY PASSENGER

02:13:10.816 --> 02:13:13.151
VEHICLES VERY OFTEN SO WE GET

02:13:13.218 --> 02:13:15.921
FAR MORE BANG FOR OUR BUCK IF WE

02:13:15.987 --> 02:13:17.789
INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT.

02:13:17.856 --> 02:13:19.725
IN THE HEAVY MEDIUM DO DO THE

02:13:19.791 --> 02:13:23.328
VEHICLE -- REBATES AND

02:13:23.395 --> 02:13:25.397
INCENTIVES BECAUSE THE CHAIN

02:13:25.464 --> 02:13:26.965
CHANT DATE WE REPLACE THEM MORE

02:13:27.032 --> 02:13:29.334
FREQUENTLY SO WE'RE GOING TO GET.

02:13:29.401 --> 02:13:30.736
BETTER REDUCTION IN BOTH AIR

02:13:30.802 --> 02:13:33.138
POLLUTION AND GREENHOUSE GAS

02:13:33.205 --> 02:13:35.474
EMISSIONS REDUCTION IF WE FIND

02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:36.241
OUT POP BETTER.

02:13:36.308 --> 02:13:39.077
SO I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE CASE FOR

02:13:39.144 --> 02:13:41.213
MY PURPOSE IN SAYING ALL THAT

02:13:41.279 --> 02:13:41.847
WAS TO MAKE THE CASE FOR BOTH OF

02:13:41.913 --> 02:13:47.786
THOSE -- ADDITIONALLY -- THE

02:13:47.853 --> 02:13:49.388
HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM.

02:13:49.454 --> 02:13:51.556
WHAT THE RESEARCH NOW SHOWS IS

02:13:51.623 --> 02:13:53.325
THAT SOILS HAVE?

02:13:53.392 --> 02:13:57.028
A MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN

02:13:57.095 --> 02:14:00.265
CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE THEN

02:14:00.332 --> 02:14:03.769
I OUR OUR FOR CLIMATE ACTION

02:14:03.835 --> 02:14:08.306
PLAN HAS NECESSARILY ACCOUNTED.

02:14:08.373 --> 02:14:10.942
FOR AND GIVEN THE THE RISE IN

02:14:11.009 --> 02:14:12.377
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS NOT

02:14:12.444 --> 02:14:13.945
ONLY IN OUR STATE I MEAN WE'RE

02:14:14.012 --> 02:14:15.013
WE'VE.

02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:16.548
THEY'RE NOT.

02:14:16.615 --> 02:14:18.183
RISING TO THE LEVEL THAT.

02:14:18.250 --> 02:14:19.484
IN OTHER PLACES BECAUSE

02:14:19.551 --> 02:14:20.819
OBVIOUSLY OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE

02:14:20.886 --> 02:14:23.422
DONE BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THINGS

02:14:23.488 --> 02:14:25.524
LIKE THE WILDFIRES IN OTHERS IT

02:14:25.590 --> 02:14:26.525
DOES.

02:14:26.591 --> 02:14:28.827
SET MUCH OF OUR GOOD WORK SO

02:14:28.894 --> 02:14:30.462
WHAT THIS REALLY TELLS US

02:14:30.529 --> 02:14:33.465
GLOBALLY IS THAT WE NEED.

02:14:33.532 --> 02:14:35.367
MORE THAN JUST DIRECT EMISSIONS

02:14:35.434 --> 02:14:37.402
REDUCTION WE NEED ALSO TO

02:14:37.469 --> 02:14:38.670
STRENGTHEN.

02:14:38.737 --> 02:14:42.007
THE THE CARBON -- STORAGE AND

02:14:42.073 --> 02:14:44.209
THAT'S OF COURSE IN OUR FORESTS

02:14:44.276 --> 02:14:45.977
IN OUR OCEANS.

02:14:46.044 --> 02:14:48.513
AND VARIOUS OTHER ARE CORAL

02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:51.650
REEFS BUT IT IS ALSO OUR SOILS

02:14:51.716 --> 02:14:54.186
AND THE HEALTHY SOILS RESEARCH

02:14:54.252 --> 02:14:55.787
SO FAR THE CARD TYPE OF PROJECTS

02:14:55.854 --> 02:14:56.721
WE FUNDED.

02:14:56.788 --> 02:14:58.290
HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT IT'S

02:14:58.356 --> 02:15:01.526
REALLY HAS A GREAT CAPACITY FOR

02:15:01.593 --> 02:15:04.229
CARBON STORAGE SO I WOULD LIKE

02:15:04.296 --> 02:15:07.199
TO SEE THAT -- THE SENATE

02:15:07.265 --> 02:15:09.134
VERSION IS IT THINK A HEALTHIER

02:15:09.201 --> 02:15:11.303
FUNDING LEVEL FOR THOSE HEALTHY

02:15:11.369 --> 02:15:14.072
SOILS -- AND IN THE

02:15:14.139 --> 02:15:16.641
TRANSFORMATIVE COMMUNITIES WHICH

02:15:16.708 --> 02:15:20.145
THE GOVERNOR'S -- RECOMMENDED I

02:15:20.212 --> 02:15:20.846
THINK.

02:15:20.912 --> 02:15:22.614
LET'S SEE IF I GET THAT RATE

02:15:22.681 --> 02:15:24.015
TRANSFERRED COMMUNITIES.

02:15:24.082 --> 02:15:26.051
IS HIGHER THAN EITHER OF OUR

02:15:26.117 --> 02:15:28.920
HOUSES -- NOT SURE WHAT THE

02:15:28.987 --> 02:15:31.256
DEBATE WAS IN OUR OUR TWO HOUSES

02:15:31.323 --> 02:15:32.991
MAYBE THE ASSEMBLIES BECAUSE IT

02:15:33.058 --> 02:15:34.326
DOESN'T BREAK IT DOWN IS MORE

02:15:34.392 --> 02:15:35.460
LIKE THE GOVERNOR'S.

02:15:35.527 --> 02:15:37.462
BUT I THINK THAT WHAT WE'VE SEEN

02:15:37.529 --> 02:15:40.031
IS THAT -- SOME VERY GOOD WORK

02:15:40.098 --> 02:15:42.434
IN THE AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN

02:15:42.501 --> 02:15:44.769
FUNDED SO FAR BUT THE ONE NOTE

02:15:44.836 --> 02:15:46.137
IF WE DO.

02:15:46.204 --> 02:15:48.306
GO WITH FUNDING LEVEL OF THE

02:15:48.373 --> 02:15:48.840
SORT THAT THE GOVERNOR'S

02:15:48.907 --> 02:15:51.343
RECOMMENDING I WOULD LIKE TO SEE

02:15:51.409 --> 02:15:54.145
THAT WE EXPAND THE ELIGIBILITY

02:15:54.212 --> 02:15:56.414
FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION GRANTS.

02:15:56.481 --> 02:15:58.984
TO THE TOP 15% OF CAL AND VIRUS

02:15:59.050 --> 02:16:00.952
SCREEN THE REASON I RAISE THAT

02:16:01.019 --> 02:16:03.822
IS BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU CAN IF

02:16:03.889 --> 02:16:05.690
YOU'RE IN THE TOP 25% YOU CAN

02:16:05.757 --> 02:16:06.391
APPLY.

02:16:06.458 --> 02:16:07.993
SO YOU CAN GET A PLAN GRANT BUT

02:16:08.059 --> 02:16:10.829
THEN OUR CURRENT FUNDING FOR THE

02:16:10.896 --> 02:16:12.030
IMPLEMENTATION IS.

02:16:12.097 --> 02:16:18.503
RESTRICTED ONLY TO THE TOP 5% SO

02:16:18.570 --> 02:16:19.638
BASICALLY WE'RE FINDING PEOPLE

02:16:19.704 --> 02:16:20.171
TO PLAN.

02:16:20.238 --> 02:16:21.373
THEY DO GREAT PLANS.

02:16:21.439 --> 02:16:22.774
REALLY GOOD PROJECTS AND THEN

02:16:22.841 --> 02:16:25.043
THEY CAN'T APPLY FOR MONEY TO

02:16:25.110 --> 02:16:27.112
IMPLEMENTED UNDER THE STRUCTURE

02:16:27.178 --> 02:16:28.480
WE'VE DEVELOPED SO I'D LIKE TO

02:16:28.547 --> 02:16:32.083
SEE THAT STRUCTURE FIXED -- AND

02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:35.053
THEN -- ON THE WASTE DIVERSION

02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:37.589
AND RECYCLING FOOD WASTE I THINK

02:16:37.656 --> 02:16:39.224
WE'VE RECOGNIZED.

02:16:39.291 --> 02:16:41.626
THAT INCREASINGLY FOOD WASTE

02:16:41.693 --> 02:16:43.328
SIMILAR TO YOU KNOW HEALTHY

02:16:43.395 --> 02:16:44.629
SOILS BEING A GREAT.

02:16:44.696 --> 02:16:47.232
CARBON STORAGE THAT FOOD WASTE

02:16:47.299 --> 02:16:49.334
IS A HIGHER IN MOREAND MORE

02:16:49.401 --> 02:16:51.236
SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF OUR

02:16:51.303 --> 02:16:53.104
METHANE EMISSIONS AND THAT THE

02:16:53.171 --> 02:16:55.740
MORE FOOD WASTE WE CAN.

02:16:55.807 --> 02:16:59.044
CAPTURE AN AND IN AFFECT EITHER

02:16:59.110 --> 02:17:01.846
COMPOST RECYCLE OR OR UTILIZED

02:17:01.913 --> 02:17:03.615
IN A WAY OTHER THAN IN THE

02:17:03.682 --> 02:17:06.117
LANDFILL WORK CREATES METHANE.

02:17:06.184 --> 02:17:09.554
THAT THAT IS A A GOOD USE THAN

02:17:09.621 --> 02:17:11.222
WHAT WE'VE SEEN NOW IS A LOT OF

02:17:11.289 --> 02:17:13.592
THE ENTITIES FOUR POINT TO THE

02:17:13.658 --> 02:17:14.225
MONEY.

02:17:14.292 --> 02:17:16.294
THAT IS IN THE FOOD WASTE

02:17:16.361 --> 02:17:18.063
CATEGORY THEY'RE ACTUALLY

02:17:18.129 --> 02:17:19.664
THEY'RE NOT JUST COMPOSTING IT

02:17:19.731 --> 02:17:22.200
THEY ARE GETTING THAT FOOD BACK

02:17:22.267 --> 02:17:23.835
OUT TO FOR NEEDED.

02:17:23.902 --> 02:17:26.071
THEY ARE TAKING -- FOR EXAMPLE

02:17:26.137 --> 02:17:28.273
OUT FROM FARMERS MARKETS FROM

02:17:28.340 --> 02:17:30.241
GROCERY STORES AND SUCH PRODUCE

02:17:30.308 --> 02:17:32.110
THAT IS BEEN DEEMED BY THE

02:17:32.177 --> 02:17:34.279
SELLER NOT TO BE STE SELLABLE

02:17:34.346 --> 02:17:35.547
BUT IS STILL.

02:17:35.614 --> 02:17:38.016
SAFE AND AN EDIBLE AND THEY'RE

02:17:38.083 --> 02:17:39.951
GETTING IT OUT TO WHETHER IT'S

02:17:40.018 --> 02:17:41.920
FOOD BANKS FOR OTHERS SO IT'S

02:17:41.987 --> 02:17:43.455
REALLY IT'S MEETING TWO VERY

02:17:43.521 --> 02:17:45.090
IMPORTANT GOALS ARE HUNGER

02:17:45.156 --> 02:17:47.092
CHALLENGES AS WELL AS OUR

02:17:47.158 --> 02:17:48.760
GREENHOUSE GAS CHALLENGES.

02:17:48.827 --> 02:17:51.863
SO I FEEL THAT THE SENATE'S --

02:17:51.930 --> 02:17:55.100
LEVEL OF A REQUEST FOR THAT FOOD

02:17:55.166 --> 02:18:00.205
WASTE IS -- QUITE IS IS VERY

02:18:00.271 --> 02:18:02.874
JUSTIFIABLE -- AND THEN LASTLY I

02:18:02.941 --> 02:18:06.077
WANTED TO RAISE THAT WE WE DON'T

02:18:06.144 --> 02:18:08.580
HAVE AS FAR AS I CAN TELL IN OUR

02:18:08.647 --> 02:18:11.116
CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN.

02:18:11.182 --> 02:18:12.717
ANYTHING TO DEAL WITH.

02:18:12.784 --> 02:18:13.852
OUR EXISTING BANK OF

02:18:13.918 --> 02:18:15.887
REFRIGERANTS SO WE'RE TALKING

02:18:15.954 --> 02:18:17.322
NOW.

02:18:17.389 --> 02:18:22.260
THE H. CFCS BE -- THE SHORT.

02:18:22.327 --> 02:18:24.062
LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS.

02:18:24.129 --> 02:18:27.332
SENATOR LARA WHEN HE WAS SENATOR

02:18:27.399 --> 02:18:29.267
CARRIED A BILL ON THIS AND MADE

02:18:29.334 --> 02:18:31.202
IT A PRIORITY FOR CARP TO START

02:18:31.269 --> 02:18:33.004
LOOKING AT THESE VARIOUS SHORT

02:18:33.071 --> 02:18:34.539
LIVED POLLUTANTS.

02:18:34.606 --> 02:18:36.474
BUT THEY HAVE A VERY VERY HIGH

02:18:36.541 --> 02:18:38.043
GREENHOUSE GAS POTENTIAL.

02:18:38.109 --> 02:18:39.678
AND THE LATEST RESEARCH

02:18:39.744 --> 02:18:42.514
INDICATES THAT JUST RIGHT NOW UP

02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:44.249
AND DOWN STATE CALIFORNIA IN OUR

02:18:44.315 --> 02:18:46.651
EXISTING AIR CONDITIONERS IN OUR

02:18:46.718 --> 02:18:47.952
EXISTING REFRIGERATORS.

02:18:48.019 --> 02:18:49.154
MEANING BOTH COMMERCIAL AND

02:18:49.220 --> 02:18:50.588
HOUSEHOLD.

02:18:50.655 --> 02:18:54.325
THAT SITTING IN THOSE UNITS.

02:18:54.392 --> 02:18:56.394
IS ENOUGH OF THIS REFRIGERANT

02:18:56.461 --> 02:18:57.829
MATERIAL.

02:18:57.896 --> 02:19:00.031
THAT IF IT WERE TO BE RELEASED

02:19:00.098 --> 02:19:01.066
AT ONCE NOW YOU KNOW I KNOW IT'S

02:19:01.132 --> 02:19:02.834
HYPOTHETICAL IS NOT LIKELY BE

02:19:02.901 --> 02:19:04.602
RELEASED AT ONCE BUT JUST HEAR

02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:05.403
THE POINT.

02:19:05.470 --> 02:19:07.138
THAT IF IT WERE TO BE RELEASED

02:19:07.205 --> 02:19:08.006
AT ONCE.

02:19:08.073 --> 02:19:10.675
IT WOULD CREATE A GREATER GLOBAL

02:19:10.742 --> 02:19:12.544
WARMING.

02:19:12.610 --> 02:19:15.647
AT THE GREATER HIT ON OUR FULL

02:19:15.714 --> 02:19:18.917
CARBON -- CALCULATION THEN FROM

02:19:18.983 --> 02:19:22.320
ALL OTHER SOURCES IN ANY GIVEN

02:19:22.387 --> 02:19:24.222
YEAR IN CALIFORNIA.

02:19:24.289 --> 02:19:28.393
SO THIS IS STUFF THAT IF WE IF

02:19:28.460 --> 02:19:31.429
WE FOCUS ON HOW TO CAPTURE IT.

02:19:31.496 --> 02:19:33.898
INSTEAD OF ALLOWING IT. TO TO BE

02:19:33.965 --> 02:19:35.567
FUGITIVE EMISSIONS [inaudible]

02:19:35.633 --> 02:19:37.402
WE WOULD.

02:19:37.469 --> 02:19:39.037
WE WOULD DO A GREAT DEAL TO

02:19:39.104 --> 02:19:41.139
PROTECT OUR CLIMATE AND WE WOULD

02:19:41.206 --> 02:19:43.742
NOT IF WE JUST IGNORE IT SO I

02:19:43.808 --> 02:19:45.844
THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE THAT

02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:48.113
NEED ATTENTION AND IS NOT

02:19:48.179 --> 02:19:49.547
ANYWHERE IN ANYONE'S PLAN.

02:19:49.614 --> 02:19:53.451
SO JUST WANTED TO GET THOSE OUT

02:19:53.518 --> 02:19:53.752
[inaudible]

02:19:53.818 --> 02:19:55.720
OKAY.

02:19:55.787 --> 02:19:57.455
THANK YOU I DON'T WANT TO START

02:19:57.522 --> 02:19:59.457
ON TO A DEGREE WAS SENATOR

02:19:59.524 --> 02:20:01.126
SCARES COMMENTS AND THEN JUST

02:20:01.192 --> 02:20:02.861
ADD ADD SOME THINGS.

02:20:02.927 --> 02:20:04.496
ON IT IS GOING BACK TO LA -- AND

02:20:04.562 --> 02:20:08.533
FINANCE I THINK ONE OF OUR THE

02:20:08.600 --> 02:20:09.901
REASON OUR THERE ARE PROPOSAL

02:20:09.968 --> 02:20:11.469
PUT MORE MONEY TOWARDS LOW

02:20:11.536 --> 02:20:13.738
CARBON TRANSPORTATION OBVIOUSLY.

02:20:13.805 --> 02:20:15.273
IS THE ONE AREA WHERE WE'RE NOT

02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:16.407
MAKING PROGRESS AND

02:20:16.474 --> 02:20:17.742
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S THE

02:20:17.809 --> 02:20:20.111
EVERYWHERE IF WE DON'T START TO

02:20:20.178 --> 02:20:22.046
TURN THINGS AROUND VERY QUICKLY

02:20:22.113 --> 02:20:23.782
WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MEET

02:20:23.848 --> 02:20:25.416
ALL OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION

02:20:25.483 --> 02:20:27.952
GOAL START WITH THAT WE SET OUT

02:20:28.019 --> 02:20:31.322
ITS. 40% OF TIONS AND YOU'LL

02:20:31.389 --> 02:20:33.892
KNOW THAT 80% OF THE ADMISSIONS

02:20:33.958 --> 02:20:35.527
COMES FROM PASSENGER VEHICLE SO.

02:20:35.593 --> 02:20:37.529
GOING INTO THE CLEAN VEHICLE

02:20:37.595 --> 02:20:40.398
REBATE PROGRAM -- WAS CONCERNED

02:20:40.465 --> 02:20:43.334
BY THE REPORT THAT CAR PUT OUT

02:20:43.401 --> 02:20:44.602
SAYING THAT.

02:20:44.669 --> 02:20:47.806
EVEN IF WE APPROPRIATED THAT THE

02:20:47.872 --> 02:20:49.107
TWO HUNDRED MILLION WHICH IS THE

02:20:49.174 --> 02:20:50.675
THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

02:20:50.742 --> 02:20:51.843
THAT'S IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:53.311
THAT THEY MAY BE.

02:20:53.378 --> 02:20:56.214
OUT OF MONEY WITHIN THE FIRST

02:20:56.281 --> 02:20:57.949
FEW MONTHS OF THE FISCAL YEAR.

02:20:58.016 --> 02:21:00.785
SOMETIMES THE FIRST QUESTION THE

02:21:00.852 --> 02:21:02.053
THE OTHER QUESTION WAS ON SORT

02:21:02.120 --> 02:21:04.889
OF SORT OF GIVEN THAT RATHER

02:21:04.956 --> 02:21:06.858
THAN JUST GIVING.

02:21:06.925 --> 02:21:09.794
MONEY TO A INCENTIVE PROGRAM

02:21:09.861 --> 02:21:11.596
THAT'S SORT OF NOT REALLY ANSWER

02:21:11.663 --> 02:21:12.664
PROGRESS MARK AND TITLE MY

02:21:12.730 --> 02:21:14.566
PROGRAM WHERE YOU JUST GET

02:21:14.632 --> 02:21:15.500
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND

02:21:15.567 --> 02:21:16.668
HE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS

02:21:16.734 --> 02:21:17.902
TODAY YOU GET TWENTY FIVE

02:21:17.969 --> 02:21:19.037
HUNDRED DOLLARS NEXT YEAR OR

02:21:19.103 --> 02:21:23.007
EVEN THE YEAR AFTER -- IN A

02:21:23.074 --> 02:21:23.908
RATHER THAN -- BAILING THAT

02:21:23.975 --> 02:21:25.176
PROGRAM OUT PER SE UNDER THE

02:21:25.243 --> 02:21:27.345
CURRENT STRUCTURE HAS THERE BEEN

02:21:27.412 --> 02:21:29.080
RETHINKING ABOUT SHOULD BE SURE

02:21:29.147 --> 02:21:31.950
WE KIND OF GO TO SEE THE R. P.

02:21:32.016 --> 02:21:33.618
TWO POINT NO ONE REALLY RETHINK.

02:21:33.685 --> 02:21:35.787
HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET TO OUR

02:21:35.854 --> 02:21:37.956
FIVE MILLION?

02:21:38.022 --> 02:21:42.026
A VEHICLE CALL CENTERS.

02:21:42.093 --> 02:21:43.862
YEAH SO ON ON YOUR FIRST POINT --

02:21:43.928 --> 02:21:45.096
YET WE HAVE SEEN THOSE

02:21:45.163 --> 02:21:47.665
PROJECTIONS FROM CAR BUT I MEAN

02:21:47.732 --> 02:21:49.334
THERE'S YOU KNOW AND AS IN MANY

02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:50.235
CASES THERE'S KIND OF A LOT OF

02:21:50.301 --> 02:21:51.636
UNCERTAINTY AND I THINK THIS

02:21:51.703 --> 02:21:52.570
KIND OF UNCERTAINTY AROUND.

02:21:52.637 --> 02:21:54.372
YEAH THE TESLA MODEL THREE ROLL

02:21:54.439 --> 02:21:55.273
OUT IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH SORT

02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:56.808
OF SNOW THAT WILL YOU KNOW THOSE

02:21:56.875 --> 02:21:58.009
HIGHER NUMBERS IN RECENT MONTHS

02:21:58.076 --> 02:21:59.577
MAYBE WILL CONTINUE BUT IT

02:21:59.644 --> 02:22:01.913
CERTAINLY -- AN ISSUE WORSE KIND

02:22:01.980 --> 02:22:03.748
OF FUEL CONSIDERING WHETHER OR

02:22:03.815 --> 02:22:04.849
NOT THEY THEY WILL HAVE ENOUGH

02:22:04.916 --> 02:22:05.783
MONEY OR KIND OF HOW MUCH MONEY

02:22:05.850 --> 02:22:07.185
WILL HELP IN THE IN THE UPCOMING

02:22:07.252 --> 02:22:08.786
YEAR AND THEN I GETS TO YOUR

02:22:08.853 --> 02:22:10.355
SECOND POINT I THINK IS YOU KNOW

02:22:10.421 --> 02:22:11.356
IT AND WE THINK IT'S AN

02:22:11.422 --> 02:22:12.223
IMPORTANT POINT. FOR THE

02:22:12.290 --> 02:22:13.658
LEGISLATURE TO BE CONSIDERING IT

02:22:13.725 --> 02:22:15.827
IS -- YOU KNOW HOW THAT PROGRAM

02:22:15.894 --> 02:22:16.928
SHOULD BE STRUCTURED GOING

02:22:16.995 --> 02:22:19.197
FORWARD AND IF THERE IS GOING TO

02:22:19.264 --> 02:22:21.266
BE THE SORT OF LOWER FUNDING

02:22:21.332 --> 02:22:23.101
AMOUNT THEN -- CARPAL LIKELY

02:22:23.167 --> 02:22:25.103
HAVE TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO

02:22:25.169 --> 02:22:27.071
ITS PROGRAM AND THAT COULD BE IN

02:22:27.138 --> 02:22:27.639
A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS

02:22:27.705 --> 02:22:28.439
WHETHER IT BE.

02:22:28.506 --> 02:22:29.874
CHANGING THE INCOME CAPS

02:22:29.941 --> 02:22:31.509
CHANGING YOU KNOW WHICH CARS

02:22:31.576 --> 02:22:33.211
QUALIFY WERE VARIETY OF OTHER

02:22:33.278 --> 02:22:34.846
THINGS AND SO -- WE DO THINK

02:22:34.913 --> 02:22:36.781
IT'S AN IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE

02:22:36.848 --> 02:22:37.348
LEGISLATURE TO THINK ABOUT

02:22:37.415 --> 02:22:38.716
WHETHER IT WHAT WHAT CHANGES

02:22:38.783 --> 02:22:41.185
CARDS IS CONSIDERING AND WHETHER

02:22:41.252 --> 02:22:42.320
OR NOT THOSE TYPES OF CHANGES

02:22:42.387 --> 02:22:43.521
ARE CONSISTENT WITH IT WITH THE

02:22:43.588 --> 02:22:48.793
LEGISLATORS PRIORITY IN ITS

02:22:48.860 --> 02:22:49.360
VISION FOR THE PROGRAM GOING

02:22:49.427 --> 02:22:51.262
FORWARD.

02:22:51.329 --> 02:22:52.263
THE TREES A CALORIE DEPARTMENT

02:22:52.330 --> 02:22:53.464
OF FINANCE I THINK THAT LINED UP

02:22:53.531 --> 02:22:54.599
WITH THE EXPECTATION OF THE

02:22:54.666 --> 02:22:55.700
FUNDING THAT WAS PUT IN -- FOR

02:22:55.767 --> 02:22:57.435
THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION THAT

02:22:57.502 --> 02:22:58.036
THERE WOULD BE AN EXPECTATION

02:22:58.102 --> 02:22:59.437
THAT THOSE. FIVE ELIGIBILITY

02:22:59.504 --> 02:23:01.372
REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE REVISITED

02:23:01.439 --> 02:23:03.074
WHETHER IT'S INCOME LEVELS ARE

02:23:03.141 --> 02:23:03.274
OTHER.

02:23:03.341 --> 02:23:05.343
PARTS OF THE PROGRAM.

02:23:05.410 --> 02:23:07.879
I SEE SO SO WHO TOOK IT SO GIVEN

02:23:07.946 --> 02:23:11.582
THAT -- IT IS ASSUMING THAT WE

02:23:11.649 --> 02:23:13.518
WE WOULD PAY OUT.

02:23:13.584 --> 02:23:14.786
PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T PAID IN THIS

02:23:14.852 --> 02:23:15.887
FISCAL YEAR UNDER THE CURRENT

02:23:15.954 --> 02:23:17.789
CRITERIA WE WOULD DO THAT AND

02:23:17.855 --> 02:23:19.590
THEN POTENTIALLY UNDER THE NEW

02:23:19.657 --> 02:23:20.825
FISCAL YEAR HAVE TO REVISE OUR

02:23:20.892 --> 02:23:22.927
CRITERIA THAT.

02:23:22.994 --> 02:23:24.262
RIGHT AND IT I DON'T KNOW THAT

02:23:24.329 --> 02:23:25.530
IT WAS SPECIFIC TO AT WHAT POINT

02:23:25.596 --> 02:23:26.864
TO THOSE CRITERIA WOULD BE

02:23:26.931 --> 02:23:28.433
REVISITED BUT YES I THINK THAT

02:23:28.499 --> 02:23:29.934
TECHNICIAN WAS.

02:23:30.001 --> 02:23:31.502
THAT AS THE SALES ARE INCREASING --

02:23:31.569 --> 02:23:33.838
GIVEN THE LEVEL OF MONEY THAT

02:23:33.905 --> 02:23:34.472
THOSE WOULD HAVE TO BE REVISITED

02:23:34.539 --> 02:23:35.473
AT SOME POINT.

02:23:35.540 --> 02:23:37.842
OKAY GREAT THANK YOU CAN IN WAS

02:23:37.909 --> 02:23:40.745
THERE -- WAS THERE A SENSE AND

02:23:40.812 --> 02:23:42.780
HOW LONG THE PROGRAM WOULD HAVE

02:23:42.847 --> 02:23:44.615
WOULD HAVE TO GO ON TO EXIST TO

02:23:44.682 --> 02:23:47.618
GET TO OUR FIVE MILLION VEHICLE

02:23:47.685 --> 02:23:49.520
GOAL LIKE LIKE ANY INCENTIVE

02:23:49.587 --> 02:23:53.157
PROGRAM AT SOME POINT THAT HAS.

02:23:53.224 --> 02:23:54.559
TO STOP I MEAN WE HAVE TO WHAT

02:23:54.625 --> 02:23:56.327
WE HAD A PARTICULAR GOAL WE

02:23:56.394 --> 02:23:58.529
SHOULD BE ABLE TO STOP IT.

02:23:58.596 --> 02:24:00.565
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT I THINK WE

02:24:00.631 --> 02:24:02.800
WERE ENVISIONING AT THE SIMILAR

02:24:02.867 --> 02:24:04.736
TO YOU KNOW SOLAR WHICH WAS YOU

02:24:04.802 --> 02:24:06.304
KNOW AND KIND OF THE BEGINNING

02:24:06.371 --> 02:24:07.772
AS YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCELERATE --

02:24:07.839 --> 02:24:09.941
YOU WANTED TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES

02:24:10.008 --> 02:24:11.776
BUT THEN AS THE COMMERCIAL

02:24:11.843 --> 02:24:14.379
VIABILITY BECAME MORE REAL THAN

02:24:14.445 --> 02:24:15.580
THE NEED FOR THE SUBSIDY WOULD

02:24:15.646 --> 02:24:16.614
DECLINE.

02:24:16.681 --> 02:24:19.684
AND SO THE IDEA BEHIND THE TWO

02:24:19.751 --> 02:24:21.252
HUNDRED MILLION WAS IS THAT --

02:24:21.319 --> 02:24:23.554
AS THE DEMAND WENT UP YOU COULD

02:24:23.621 --> 02:24:25.189
KIND OF FOCUS SAID IN TAYLOR IT

02:24:25.256 --> 02:24:27.291
MORE TOWARDS SAY THE LOW TO

02:24:27.358 --> 02:24:28.793
MIDDLE INCOME.

02:24:28.860 --> 02:24:31.562
EARNERS WHERE THE INCENTIVE HAS

02:24:31.629 --> 02:24:33.297
A GREATER MARGINALIZED THAT ON

02:24:33.364 --> 02:24:34.966
DECISION MAKING THAN SAY HIGHER

02:24:35.033 --> 02:24:36.601
INCOME AS AN AS AN ILLUSTRATIVE

02:24:36.667 --> 02:24:37.502
EXAMPLE.

02:24:37.568 --> 02:24:39.037
NOW YOU ALSO MIGHT RECALL THAT

02:24:39.103 --> 02:24:40.638
LAST YEAR -- THE PRIOR

02:24:40.705 --> 02:24:42.373
ADMINISTRATION HAD AGAIN A

02:24:42.440 --> 02:24:43.908
PORTFOLIO APPROACH WHERE IT

02:24:43.975 --> 02:24:45.543
WASN'T JUST REBATES BUT IT WAS

02:24:45.610 --> 02:24:47.078
ALSO AN INFRASTRUCTURE

02:24:47.145 --> 02:24:49.347
INVESTMENT WHERE -- THROUGH AN

02:24:49.414 --> 02:24:50.748
ENERGY COMMISSION PROGRAM --

02:24:50.815 --> 02:24:52.483
THEY WERE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS

02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:54.852
IN THEIR MISSION INFRASTRUCTURE

02:24:54.919 --> 02:24:56.454
WHICH HELPS.

02:24:56.521 --> 02:24:57.989
AGAIN IN THE CONSUMER DECISION

02:24:58.056 --> 02:24:59.824
MAKING PROCESS WHERE I THINK WE

02:24:59.891 --> 02:25:01.292
TALKED ABOUT RANGING SOCIETY.

02:25:01.359 --> 02:25:02.360
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN

02:25:02.427 --> 02:25:04.562
GET ADDITIONAL CHARGING STATIONS

02:25:04.629 --> 02:25:06.898
SPREAD OUT MORE THAT THEN --

02:25:06.964 --> 02:25:10.601
CREATES -- MORE -- CONFIDENCE

02:25:10.668 --> 02:25:12.236
FROM THE CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE

02:25:12.303 --> 02:25:13.271
THAT THEY WOULD BE CHARGING

02:25:13.337 --> 02:25:16.307
STATIONS AVAILABLE IN MAKING THE

02:25:16.374 --> 02:25:17.642
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES MORE

02:25:17.708 --> 02:25:19.110
VIABLE AND SO.

02:25:19.177 --> 02:25:20.645
WHAT I WOULD SAY THEN IS YOU

02:25:20.711 --> 02:25:22.713
KNOW THERE IS I THINK IT'S GO

02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:29.253
BIZ I HAS A -- KIND OF GROUP

02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:30.088
THAT CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE

02:25:30.154 --> 02:25:31.022
PROGRESS OF ZERO EMISSION

02:25:31.089 --> 02:25:32.156
VEHICLES COLLABORATES WITH

02:25:32.223 --> 02:25:33.591
ENERGY COMMISSION AS WELL AS

02:25:33.658 --> 02:25:34.325
THEIR BOARD.

02:25:34.392 --> 02:25:37.595
AND WILL YOU KNOW -- THEIR BOARD

02:25:37.662 --> 02:25:38.963
OF COURSE -- CONTINUES TO

02:25:39.030 --> 02:25:42.467
JUSTICE PROGRAM YEAR BY YEAR

02:25:42.533 --> 02:25:42.967
BASED ON KIND OF FUNDING

02:25:43.034 --> 02:25:44.202
AVAILABILITY.

02:25:44.268 --> 02:25:45.536
IN THE COURSE WITH WITH RANGE

02:25:45.603 --> 02:25:46.337
ANXIETY PART OF THAT ARE THE

02:25:46.404 --> 02:25:47.405
BIGGEST CHALLENGES FROM THE CAN

02:25:47.472 --> 02:25:48.873
DOWN A MAKERS.

02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:50.274
TO MAKE CARS THAT HAVE REAL

02:25:50.341 --> 02:25:52.110
RANGERS NOW THAT WERE WERE

02:25:52.176 --> 02:25:54.045
MOVING AWAY FROM COMPLIANCE CARS

02:25:54.112 --> 02:25:55.179
AND ACTUALLY.

02:25:55.246 --> 02:25:56.180
THEY'RE BUILDING WILL YOU KNOW

02:25:56.247 --> 02:25:59.050
REAL CARS WITH REAL RANGES OF

02:25:59.117 --> 02:25:59.650
TWO HUNDRED PLUS MILES I THINK

02:25:59.717 --> 02:26:02.153
THAT'S SLOWLY -- MOVED AWAY I

02:26:02.220 --> 02:26:03.554
THINK I THINK THE SOLAR EXAMPLES

02:26:03.621 --> 02:26:05.356
A GREAT EXAMPLE I THINK THE ONE

02:26:05.423 --> 02:26:07.458
BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOLAR AND

02:26:07.525 --> 02:26:08.826
CV OUR P. WAS.

02:26:08.893 --> 02:26:10.761
THEY HAD AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM

02:26:10.828 --> 02:26:12.163
THAT STARTED HIGH AND WENT

02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:14.699
TOWARDS ZERO AND RATCHET DOWN

02:26:14.765 --> 02:26:16.434
BASED ON VOLUME SO ACTUALLY CRY

02:26:16.501 --> 02:26:18.269
THINK IT CREATED.

02:26:18.336 --> 02:26:21.372
MILESTONES AND TARGETS THAT WERE

02:26:21.439 --> 02:26:22.773
HIT ALONG THE WAY AND THAT'S

02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:26.878
WHAT WOULD TRIGGER THE LOWER --

02:26:26.944 --> 02:26:29.514
INCENTIVE.

02:26:29.580 --> 02:26:30.148
SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

02:26:30.214 --> 02:26:30.515
WE SHOULD BE.

02:26:30.581 --> 02:26:31.182
CONSIDERING AS WELL AS TAKING A

02:26:31.249 --> 02:26:32.316
HARDER LOOK AT RATHER THAN JUST

02:26:32.383 --> 02:26:34.285
HAVING A STRAIGHT TWENTY FIVE

02:26:34.352 --> 02:26:35.553
HUNDRED DOLLAR IN ENTITLEMENT.

02:26:35.620 --> 02:26:37.722
THANK YOU.

02:26:37.788 --> 02:26:39.857
I THANK YOU MANAGER.

02:26:39.924 --> 02:26:41.192
FOCUSING ON THE WORK FORCE

02:26:41.259 --> 02:26:42.493
TRAINING PIECE AND I KNOW YOU

02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:43.394
SAID IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

02:26:43.461 --> 02:26:44.929
GOVERNOR BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS I

02:26:44.996 --> 02:26:46.898
MEAN FIRST OF ALL.

02:26:46.964 --> 02:26:48.900
I'M SORT OF ONE WHO WEEK TEND TO

02:26:48.966 --> 02:26:50.334
USE THIS GREENHOUSE GAS

02:26:50.401 --> 02:26:51.802
REDUCTION FUND IS A BANK.

02:26:51.869 --> 02:26:53.871
FROM TIME TO TIME AND I DO THINK

02:26:53.938 --> 02:26:55.940
THAT THE SINCE PEOPLE ARE PAYING

02:26:56.007 --> 02:26:57.308
FOR THIS. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE

02:26:57.375 --> 02:26:58.676
CAN.

02:26:58.743 --> 02:27:00.344
DO SO THE MONEY THAT WE SHOW

02:27:00.411 --> 02:27:01.679
ABOUT THE DOOR NEEDS SHOULD BE

02:27:01.746 --> 02:27:03.047
DIRECTLY RELATED TO GREENHOUSE

02:27:03.114 --> 02:27:05.583
GAS REDUCTION. FOR THAT REASON

02:27:05.650 --> 02:27:07.118
I'M SORT OF SENSITIVE TO WHAT MY

02:27:07.185 --> 02:27:08.653
COLLEAGUE FROM YOUR VALLEY SAID

02:27:08.719 --> 02:27:10.454
IN HIS COMMENTS ABOUT DIESEL

02:27:10.521 --> 02:27:12.023
ENGINE REPLACEMENT A VARIETY OF

02:27:12.089 --> 02:27:13.357
OTHER THINGS MAYBE WE SHOULD.

02:27:13.424 --> 02:27:15.326
BEFORE MOVING THIS MONEY IN THAT

02:27:15.393 --> 02:27:16.260
DIRECTION WHERE THERE'S A DIRECT

02:27:16.327 --> 02:27:17.562
CORRELATION BETWEEN THE

02:27:17.628 --> 02:27:18.829
EXPENDITURE.

02:27:18.896 --> 02:27:20.998
AND THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION

02:27:21.065 --> 02:27:22.266
BUT THE QUESTION [inaudible]

02:27:22.333 --> 02:27:24.468
WORKFORCE TRAINING.

02:27:24.535 --> 02:27:25.536
HOW MUCH MONEY FLOWS TO THE

02:27:25.603 --> 02:27:26.604
LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

02:27:26.671 --> 02:27:28.306
AGENCY FROM THE FEDERAL

02:27:28.372 --> 02:27:30.274
GOVERNMENT THROUGH WE OWE A? FOR

02:27:30.341 --> 02:27:33.277
TRAINING EVERY YEAR AND ONE AND

02:27:33.344 --> 02:27:35.313
TWO WHY DON'T WE TAKE THIS

02:27:35.379 --> 02:27:35.947
THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OUT

02:27:36.013 --> 02:27:38.249
OF THE THE WE OWE MONEY THAT

02:27:38.316 --> 02:27:40.284
COMES TO THE STATE THAT IS THEN

02:27:40.351 --> 02:27:43.421
DISTRIBUTED DOWN [inaudible]

02:27:43.487 --> 02:27:45.623
TO VARIOUS REGIONS.

02:27:45.690 --> 02:27:46.691
SO I CAN SPEAK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE

02:27:46.757 --> 02:27:47.825
SECOND QUESTION AND THEN A

02:27:47.892 --> 02:27:49.660
COLLEAGUE OF MINE CAN SPEAK TO

02:27:49.727 --> 02:27:51.896
THE FIRST SO I THINK. FOR THIS

02:27:51.963 --> 02:27:53.698
THE ADMINISTRATION UNDERSTANDS

02:27:53.764 --> 02:27:55.866
AND IS ALWAYS ON THE PROPOSAL

02:27:55.933 --> 02:27:57.301
THAT IT PRESENTS THE GOVERNOR'S

02:27:57.368 --> 02:27:58.903
BUDGET MAY REVISION VERY CAREFUL

02:27:58.970 --> 02:28:00.471
ABOUT THE USES OF THIS MONEY WE

02:28:00.538 --> 02:28:02.039
UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S FOR A

02:28:02.106 --> 02:28:02.773
SPECIFIC.

02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:05.476
PURPOSE WE TO BELIEVE THAT THIS

02:28:05.543 --> 02:28:07.078
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM AS

02:28:07.144 --> 02:28:08.479
DESCRIBED IS ALIGNED WITH THAT

02:28:08.546 --> 02:28:10.348
PURPOSE IT'S NOT A GENERAL

02:28:10.414 --> 02:28:11.983
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

02:28:12.049 --> 02:28:13.351
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY OPEN TO

02:28:13.417 --> 02:28:15.319
EVERYONE SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON

02:28:15.386 --> 02:28:17.054
THOSE PEOPLE IN THOSE AREAS.

02:28:17.121 --> 02:28:18.756
THAT ARE TRANSITIONING -- TO A

02:28:18.823 --> 02:28:20.458
LOW CARBON ECONOMY AND SEVEN

02:28:20.524 --> 02:28:22.793
THAT SENSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS

02:28:22.860 --> 02:28:24.562
VERY MUCH ALIGNED WITH THE GOALS

02:28:24.629 --> 02:28:26.297
OF THIS PROGRAM WHAT WHAT IS I

02:28:26.364 --> 02:28:28.899
MEAN I'M NOT I DID SIT ON THE

02:28:28.966 --> 02:28:30.801
SUBCOMMITTEE AND GENERALLY DON'T

02:28:30.868 --> 02:28:31.702
TOUCH CAP AND TRADE VERY MUCH

02:28:31.769 --> 02:28:33.437
UNLESS WE HAVE TO VOTE.

02:28:33.504 --> 02:28:34.405
WHAT WHAT WHAT DOES THAT REALLY

02:28:34.472 --> 02:28:35.773
MEAN THOUGH TRANSITIONING TO A

02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:39.310
LOW?

02:28:39.377 --> 02:28:40.678
WOULD YOU SAY LOW.

02:28:40.745 --> 02:28:42.146
OF A CARBON LOW CARBON ECONOMY

02:28:42.213 --> 02:28:43.147
WHAT DOES IT REALLY MEAN IN

02:28:43.214 --> 02:28:45.149
TERMS OF JOB TRAINING I MEAN WE

02:28:45.216 --> 02:28:46.083
TRAINING.

02:28:46.150 --> 02:28:47.685
SOLAR TECHNICIANS WHAT ARE WE

02:28:47.752 --> 02:28:49.487
DOING RIGHT TO AND THAT THE ME

02:28:49.553 --> 02:28:51.122
REVISION PROPOSAL THE THIRTY

02:28:51.188 --> 02:28:52.290
FIVE MINUTE.

02:28:52.356 --> 02:28:53.557
MILLION DOLLARS WAS TO SUPPORT

02:28:53.624 --> 02:28:55.092
THEM HIGH QUALITY SKILLED JOBS

02:28:55.159 --> 02:28:56.927
ACROSS A LOT OF AREAS OF

02:28:56.994 --> 02:28:59.597
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND

02:28:59.664 --> 02:28:59.897
INVESTMENTS.

02:28:59.964 --> 02:29:01.265
M..

02:29:01.332 --> 02:29:03.034
LOOK WHO I AM MAKE SURE THAT THE

02:29:03.100 --> 02:29:04.769
JOBS THAT ARE RELATED TO

02:29:04.835 --> 02:29:06.671
REDUCING GHG EMISSIONS ARE DONE

02:29:06.737 --> 02:29:07.405
BY WELL TRAINED WELL PAID

02:29:07.471 --> 02:29:09.440
WORKERS AND MAKING SURE THAT WE

02:29:09.507 --> 02:29:10.941
CAN ACHIEVE THE BENEFITS FROM

02:29:11.008 --> 02:29:12.843
THOSE PROGRAMS BY HAVING THAT

02:29:12.910 --> 02:29:14.245
HIGHS HIGHLY SKILLED.

02:29:14.312 --> 02:29:16.314
TRAINED JOB FORCE.

02:29:16.380 --> 02:29:17.415
WHAT WE LIKE THOSE WE LIKE THAT

02:29:17.481 --> 02:29:19.183
CONCEPT -- WHERE I COME FROM I'M

02:29:19.250 --> 02:29:20.151
JUST RYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY

02:29:20.217 --> 02:29:21.485
IT'S COMING OUT OF THE

02:29:21.552 --> 02:29:23.120
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND?

02:29:23.187 --> 02:29:26.357
AS OPPOSED TO WHAT I WHAT I

02:29:26.424 --> 02:29:28.326
SUSPECT IS A FAIRLY ROBUST

02:29:28.392 --> 02:29:29.827
AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT FLOWS TO

02:29:29.894 --> 02:29:31.262
THE STATE FOR WORKFORCE TRAINING

02:29:31.329 --> 02:29:32.763
AND DEVELOPMENT.

02:29:32.830 --> 02:29:34.231
RIGHT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING UP AND

02:29:34.298 --> 02:29:35.666
TRYING TO GET THAT THE ANSWER TO

02:29:35.733 --> 02:29:36.934
YOUR FIRST QUESTION ABOUT HOW

02:29:37.001 --> 02:29:38.002
MUCH COMES INTO THE WE ARE FROM

02:29:38.069 --> 02:29:40.204
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR THIS

02:29:40.271 --> 02:29:41.505
AND YOU'RE RIGHT THERE ARE OTHER

02:29:41.572 --> 02:29:44.108
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

02:29:44.175 --> 02:29:45.910
THIS ONE IS PARTICULAR TO I AM

02:29:45.976 --> 02:29:47.878
GETTING THAT SKILLED WORKFORCE

02:29:47.945 --> 02:29:49.347
OUT THERE IN.

02:29:49.413 --> 02:29:51.182
IN ADVANCING OUR GHG EMISSION

02:29:51.248 --> 02:29:52.717
REDUCTION GOALS AND MAKING SURE

02:29:52.783 --> 02:29:53.918
THAT THOSE WORKERS ARE THERE SO

02:29:53.984 --> 02:29:54.919
THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE OUR

02:29:54.985 --> 02:29:56.620
GREENHOUSE GAS.

02:29:56.687 --> 02:29:58.923
EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS.

02:29:58.989 --> 02:30:00.091
I'M NOT BEING CRITICAL I'M JUST

02:30:00.157 --> 02:30:01.892
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN

02:30:01.959 --> 02:30:03.494
ACCOMPLISH THE ADMINISTRATION'S

02:30:03.561 --> 02:30:05.496
OBJECTIVES HERE WITHIN THE

02:30:05.563 --> 02:30:06.797
FRAMEWORK OF THE GREENHOUSE GAS

02:30:06.864 --> 02:30:08.065
REDUCTION FUND AND WHAT WE'RE

02:30:08.132 --> 02:30:09.300
SUPPOSED TO BE DOING WITH THE

02:30:09.367 --> 02:30:11.302
MONEY THEY WERE COLLECTING FOR A

02:30:11.369 --> 02:30:11.936
WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE AROUND THE

02:30:12.002 --> 02:30:15.406
STATE. TO ADD ON TO SENATOR RUSS

02:30:15.473 --> 02:30:17.208
POINT CAN YOU GIVE EXAMPLES OF

02:30:17.274 --> 02:30:20.044
THE KINDS OF JOBS THAT THIS PART

02:30:20.111 --> 02:30:21.479
OF MONEY WOULD TRAIN.

02:30:21.545 --> 02:30:22.213
FOR MAYBE THAT WOULD HELP US

02:30:22.279 --> 02:30:23.581
UNDERSTAND IT WOULD

02:30:23.647 --> 02:30:25.416
DIFFERENTIATE FROM THE WORKFORCE

02:30:25.483 --> 02:30:26.650
DEVELOPMENT.

02:30:26.717 --> 02:30:28.586
BROADER TRAINING THE DANIEL

CENTER NIELSEN TO YOUR QUESTION

02:30:31.322 --> 02:30:34.692
THE STATE RECEIVED ABOUT THREE

02:30:34.759 --> 02:30:35.259
HUNDRED EIGHTY ONE POINT TWO

02:30:35.326 --> 02:30:36.160
MILLION DOLLARS.

02:30:36.227 --> 02:30:39.630
I'M SORRY SENATOR OFTEN FOR YOU.

02:30:39.697 --> 02:30:39.864

MILLION FOR THE MAY TWO THOUSAND

02:30:44.735 --> 02:30:46.570
NINETEEN REVISED OF WHICH ONLY

02:30:46.637 --> 02:30:47.071
FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND IS

02:30:47.138 --> 02:30:48.305
DISCRETIONARY AND THOSE FUNDS

02:30:48.372 --> 02:30:49.473
ARE USED TO THE FOR THOSE

02:30:49.540 --> 02:30:51.008
PROGRAMS EXISTING PROGRAMS IN

02:30:51.075 --> 02:30:53.844
THE WORK FORCE DATA ARENA AND

ALLY C. SO.

02:30:56.380 --> 02:30:58.249
SO FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND IS

02:30:58.315 --> 02:31:00.284
DISCRETIONARY SO THIS MILLION

02:31:00.351 --> 02:31:01.519
FIFTY SEVEN MILLION IS

02:31:01.585 --> 02:31:05.089
DISCRETIONARY I SEE.

02:31:05.156 --> 02:31:06.424
WHEN AT ONE OF THE TWO THOUSAND

02:31:06.490 --> 02:31:07.725
AND ONE OF THE CATEGORIES WE

02:31:07.792 --> 02:31:09.860
TALKED A LOT ABOUT IS -- IS THAT

02:31:09.927 --> 02:31:11.128
THE CONSTRUCTION.

02:31:11.195 --> 02:31:12.696
INDUSTRY WE'VE ALSO TALKED ABOUT

02:31:12.763 --> 02:31:14.965
LOOKING AT A FOCUS ON WORKFORCE

02:31:15.032 --> 02:31:15.833
AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND

02:31:15.900 --> 02:31:16.967
REGIONS THAT HAVE TRADITIONALLY

02:31:17.034 --> 02:31:18.436
BEEN MORE DEPENDENT ON FOSSIL

02:31:18.502 --> 02:31:19.703
FUELS IT'S ALSO REGIONAL

02:31:19.770 --> 02:31:22.640
APPROACH IN ADDITION TO KIND OF

02:31:22.706 --> 02:31:26.977
THE THE SPECIFIC TRAITS -- MAYES

02:31:27.044 --> 02:31:30.014
FOLLOWED BY THREE TO NIELSEN.

02:31:30.080 --> 02:31:35.920
I'LL BE QUICK MADAM CHAIR -- AND

02:31:35.986 --> 02:31:37.621
THEN I WANT TO JUST BOB.

02:31:37.688 --> 02:31:38.456
MAYBE TALK A LITTLE ABOUT WHAT

02:31:38.522 --> 02:31:39.857
MY IN THE LAST THREE OF MY

02:31:39.924 --> 02:31:42.493
COLLEAGUES -- HAVE HAVE SPOKEN --

02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:43.994
SENATOR SKINNER IS ABSOLUTELY

02:31:44.061 --> 02:31:45.996
ACCURATE WHEN SHE SAID THAT BY

02:31:46.063 --> 02:31:47.965
THIS POINT TO REDUCE OUR

02:31:48.032 --> 02:31:49.633
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WE HAVE.

02:31:49.700 --> 02:31:50.868
TO DEAL WITH THE TRANSPORTATION

02:31:50.935 --> 02:31:52.236
SECTOR WHICH IS WHY I'VE BEEN

02:31:52.303 --> 02:31:53.938
ARGUING FOR OF THE FOR THE

02:31:54.004 --> 02:31:55.940
FARMER PROGRAM INCREASING THAT

02:31:56.006 --> 02:31:57.708
THAT NUMBER.

02:31:57.775 --> 02:31:59.210
WE KNOW THAT MOM CLIMATE CHANGE

02:31:59.276 --> 02:32:00.578
IS REAL.

02:32:00.644 --> 02:32:02.112
I DON'T KNOW WHY WE HAVE TO SAY

02:32:02.179 --> 02:32:04.315
THAT ANYMORE IN FACT THAT'S THE

02:32:04.381 --> 02:32:05.483
THAT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS ARE

02:32:05.549 --> 02:32:07.985
STILL A FEW OF MY COLLEAGUES ON

02:32:08.052 --> 02:32:09.320
THE RIGHT NATIONALLY THAT --

02:32:09.386 --> 02:32:10.821
THAT'S A BIG DEAL WHEN THEY SAY

02:32:10.888 --> 02:32:12.356
CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL BUT THE

02:32:12.423 --> 02:32:14.258
FACTS ARE THE FACTS -- ARE

02:32:14.325 --> 02:32:15.826
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS HAVE

02:32:15.893 --> 02:32:16.427
BEEN CONTINUE TO RISE AT THE

02:32:16.494 --> 02:32:17.828
SAME TIME GLOBAL TEMPERATURES

02:32:17.895 --> 02:32:19.930
ARE RISING THE POINT OF THE CAP

02:32:19.997 --> 02:32:21.932
AND TRADE PROGRAM -- WAS TO BE

02:32:21.999 --> 02:32:23.434
ABLE TO USE THE MARKET MECHANISM

02:32:23.501 --> 02:32:24.768
TO REDUCE THOSE GREENHOUSE GAS

02:32:24.835 --> 02:32:27.972
EMISSIONS -- OVER THE OVER TIME

02:32:28.038 --> 02:32:30.040
THE REALITY IS THE FUNDS THAT WE

02:32:30.107 --> 02:32:31.275
RECEIVE THROUGH THE SELLING OF

02:32:31.342 --> 02:32:32.943
THOSE ALLOWANCES IS REALLY JUST

02:32:33.010 --> 02:32:34.478
A BY PRODUCT IT'S ACTUALLY NOT

02:32:34.545 --> 02:32:35.880
THE POINT OF IT.

02:32:35.946 --> 02:32:37.815
TOM IT'S A BY PRODUCT.

02:32:37.882 --> 02:32:39.517
BUT TO MINE -- TO CENTER RAS

02:32:39.583 --> 02:32:42.086
POINT -- HE'S EXACTLY RIGHT THAT

02:32:42.152 --> 02:32:43.687
THERE SHOULD BE A CONNECTION

02:32:43.754 --> 02:32:44.855
BETWEEN THOSE DOLLARS THAT ARE

02:32:44.922 --> 02:32:47.024
RECEIVED TO ACTUALLY REDUCING

02:32:47.091 --> 02:32:49.059
THOSE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

02:32:49.126 --> 02:32:49.560
YOU GET A BANG.

02:32:49.627 --> 02:32:53.397
YOU KNOW YOU GET TWO BIRDS WITH

02:32:53.464 --> 02:32:54.532
ONE STONE WANT ONE STONE.

02:32:54.598 --> 02:32:55.533
SO BACK TO THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL

02:32:55.599 --> 02:32:57.001
AND AND THIS IS WHY I'M TRYING

02:32:57.067 --> 02:32:57.735
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I WOULD BE

02:32:57.801 --> 02:32:59.470
SUPPORTIVE OF ARE NOT SUPPORTIVE

02:32:59.537 --> 02:33:02.406
OF A BECAUSE THE AND IN IT I

02:33:02.473 --> 02:33:03.507
HAVE ANOTHER.

02:33:03.574 --> 02:33:04.909
SHEET HERE THAT ACTUALLY SHOWS

02:33:04.975 --> 02:33:06.977
THE LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION

02:33:07.044 --> 02:33:08.379
WAS SIX HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION.

02:33:08.445 --> 02:33:10.681
AND CLIMATE SMART BAG WAS FORTY

02:33:10.748 --> 02:33:11.916
FIVE MINUTE THINK THAT FORTY

02:33:11.982 --> 02:33:13.784
FIVE MILLION MIGHT BE THE FARMER

02:33:13.851 --> 02:33:14.552
PROGRAM.

02:33:14.618 --> 02:33:15.553
BUT IT'S SEPARATE OUT

02:33:15.619 --> 02:33:17.221
DIFFERENTLY THAN THE SIX HUNDRED

02:33:17.288 --> 02:33:19.089
AND SIXTY MILLION I'M WONDERING

02:33:19.156 --> 02:33:21.625
IF IF THE GOAL OF THAT SIX

02:33:21.692 --> 02:33:23.561
HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION WAS -- FOR

02:33:23.627 --> 02:33:25.829
WHAT WHAT WAS TO INCREASE THAT

02:33:25.896 --> 02:33:28.132
THAT NUMBER -- BUT BECAUSE OUR

02:33:28.198 --> 02:33:29.600
GOAL SHOULD BE TO MAKE

02:33:29.667 --> 02:33:31.302
INVESTMENTS IN THE

02:33:31.368 --> 02:33:32.836
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR TO BILL TO

02:33:32.903 --> 02:33:34.838
REDUCE GREENHOUSE GREENHOUSE GAS

02:33:34.905 --> 02:33:37.141
EMISSIONS -- AND I DON'T KNOW IF --

02:33:37.207 --> 02:33:38.842
IF ANY WOULD IF YOU GUYS CAN CAN

02:33:38.909 --> 02:33:41.579
ANSWER THAT QUESTION -- AND IF

02:33:41.645 --> 02:33:42.913
IF THAT WAS THE CASE WE CAN

02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:44.281
INCREASE THE FORMER PROGRAM AND

02:33:44.348 --> 02:33:46.016
DO MORE INCENTIVES TO BE ABLE TO

02:33:46.083 --> 02:33:47.985
THE DIRT THAT HAVE NEW VEHICLES

02:33:48.052 --> 02:33:49.086
THAT ACTUALLY REDUCE GREENHOUSE

02:33:49.153 --> 02:33:51.722
GAS EMISSIONS I MUSED SUPPORTER

02:33:51.789 --> 02:33:54.158
OF THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL -- SO I

02:33:54.224 --> 02:33:55.859
I THINK PART OF THE ISSUE MIGHT

02:33:55.926 --> 02:33:57.795
JUST BE KIND OF KIND OF HOW THE

02:33:57.861 --> 02:33:58.963
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS ARE

02:33:59.029 --> 02:34:00.864
CATEGORIZED IN I THINK THIS GETS

02:34:00.931 --> 02:34:01.565
TO YOUR POINT LEAD AT LEAST

02:34:01.632 --> 02:34:03.367
PARTIALLY -- SO YOU KNOW FOR

02:34:03.434 --> 02:34:04.868
EXAMPLE THE ASSEMBLY PLAN WHICH

02:34:04.935 --> 02:34:07.004
INCLUDES -- SOME MORE MONEY FOR

02:34:07.071 --> 02:34:08.405
LOW CARBON TRANSPORTATION --

02:34:08.472 --> 02:34:09.974
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THAT PACKAGE

02:34:10.040 --> 02:34:11.342
COULD INCLUDE.

02:34:11.408 --> 02:34:12.943
THINGS THAT THAT THE FOR LIKE

02:34:13.010 --> 02:34:15.346
THE FARMER PROGRAM -- AT YOU

02:34:15.412 --> 02:34:17.381
KNOW WHICH IT WHICH PROVIDE SOME

02:34:17.448 --> 02:34:18.782
INCENTIVE FUNDING FOR YOUNG --

02:34:18.849 --> 02:34:21.085
TRANSPORTATION RELATED EMISSIONS

02:34:21.151 --> 02:34:22.686
RELATED TO AGRICULTURE AND SO --

02:34:22.753 --> 02:34:24.054
PART OF BY THINK PART OF JUST

02:34:24.121 --> 02:34:25.022
KIND OF THINKING ABOUT THESE

02:34:25.089 --> 02:34:26.390
PACKAGES IS KIND OF YOU KNOW ONE

02:34:26.457 --> 02:34:27.224
JUST KIND OF THINKING ABOUT HOW

02:34:27.291 --> 02:34:28.092
YOU KIND OF CATEGORIZE THOSE

02:34:28.158 --> 02:34:29.460
TYPES OF PROGRAMS WHICH I THINK

02:34:29.526 --> 02:34:30.461
COULD KIND OF FALL UNDER.

02:34:30.527 --> 02:34:31.495
JUST BE CLIMATE SMART

02:34:31.562 --> 02:34:33.364
AGRICULTURE CATEGORY OR IT COULD

02:34:33.430 --> 02:34:34.398
BE SOMETHING LIKE THE FORMER

02:34:34.465 --> 02:34:35.466
PROGRAM COULD BE FUNDED OUT OF

02:34:35.532 --> 02:34:37.067
THE THE LOW CARBON

02:34:37.134 --> 02:34:38.035
TRANSPORTATION PART AS WELL.

02:34:38.102 --> 02:34:39.570
SHOULD WE BE ASSIGNING WHAT

02:34:39.637 --> 02:34:40.537
THOSE DOLLARS ARE GOING FOR ITS

02:34:40.604 --> 02:34:42.339
IT IS SAYING IT'S FOR ALL SIX

02:34:42.406 --> 02:34:43.440
HUNDRED AND I'M SIX AND SIXTY

02:34:43.507 --> 02:34:44.842
NOT ANYTHING SHE WOULD BE

02:34:44.908 --> 02:34:48.746
ASSIGNING -- WHAT WHAT THE THAT

02:34:48.812 --> 02:34:50.581
THAT MONEY SHOULD GO TOWARDS?

02:34:50.648 --> 02:34:52.149
I I MEAN I I THINK CERTAINLY FOR

02:34:52.216 --> 02:34:52.683
LEGISLATURE KIND OF HAS

02:34:52.750 --> 02:34:55.019
PRIORITIES ON WHICH PROGRAMS IT

02:34:55.085 --> 02:34:57.021
THINKS ACCOMPLISHES ITS GOALS

02:34:57.087 --> 02:34:59.156
MOST EFFECTIVELY -- AND IT'S

02:34:59.223 --> 02:35:00.057
KIND OF CONSISTENT WITH ITS

02:35:00.124 --> 02:35:01.358
PRIORITIES WHETHER IT BE KIND OF

02:35:01.425 --> 02:35:02.760
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS OR

02:35:02.826 --> 02:35:04.561
LOCAL AIR POLLUTION REDUCTIONS

02:35:04.628 --> 02:35:05.029
THAN.

02:35:05.095 --> 02:35:07.097
SPECIFYING THAT -- IN KIND OF

02:35:07.164 --> 02:35:08.599
THE ALLOCATIONS AND PROVIDING IT

02:35:08.666 --> 02:35:10.501
TO THOSE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS WE

02:35:10.567 --> 02:35:11.135
THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA RATHER

02:35:11.201 --> 02:35:12.269
THAN YOU KNOW GIVEN MORE

02:35:12.336 --> 02:35:13.704
DISCRETION TO THE ADMINISTRATION

02:35:13.771 --> 02:35:15.072
OKAY AND AND THEN FINALLY A

02:35:15.139 --> 02:35:16.640
MANAGER JUST WANTED ALSO.

02:35:16.707 --> 02:35:17.741
ECHO SOME MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS

02:35:17.808 --> 02:35:19.576
IT SEEMS INAPPROPRIATE TO DO

02:35:19.643 --> 02:35:21.845
WORKFORCE TRAINING -- THAT

02:35:21.912 --> 02:35:22.479
THIRTY FIVE MILLION IS AN AWFUL

02:35:22.546 --> 02:35:24.248
LOT OF MONEY SEEMS NAPPROPRIATE

02:35:24.314 --> 02:35:26.216
TO BE USING TO G. R. F. MONEY.

02:35:26.283 --> 02:35:27.317
FOR WORKFORCE TRAINING A BIG FAN

02:35:27.384 --> 02:35:28.919
OF WORKFORCE TRAINING WE NEED

02:35:28.986 --> 02:35:30.621
MORE OF IT NOT LESS OF IT BUT TO

02:35:30.688 --> 02:35:35.459
USE YEAR AFTER HOURS TO DO SO I

02:35:35.526 --> 02:35:36.326
THINK IT'S AN APPROPRIATE.

02:35:36.393 --> 02:35:37.828
THANK YOU ARE CENTER NIELSEN WHO

02:35:37.895 --> 02:35:38.562
WILL BE FOLLOWED BY MR MCCARTY

02:35:38.629 --> 02:35:41.598
SINCE NIELSEN.

02:35:41.665 --> 02:35:43.200
SPEAKING OF THE SOILS.

02:35:43.267 --> 02:35:44.301
MY COLLEAGUE TALKED A LOT ABOUT

02:35:44.368 --> 02:35:45.736
THE THE SWELLS AND THAT IS

02:35:45.803 --> 02:35:48.505
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT.

02:35:48.572 --> 02:35:50.274
THESE CATACLYSMIC FIRES.

02:35:50.340 --> 02:35:54.211
A VERY HARMFUL TO OUR SOILS.

02:35:54.278 --> 02:35:56.213
THEY STERILIZE.

02:35:56.280 --> 02:35:58.182
SOME OF THE LANDS THE HE GETS SO

02:35:58.248 --> 02:36:00.184
HOT.

02:36:00.250 --> 02:36:02.086
THAT THAT LAND WILL BE STERILE

02:36:02.152 --> 02:36:04.588
FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.

02:36:04.655 --> 02:36:06.090
SO WHAT IS THE PREMIUM THERE IT

02:36:06.156 --> 02:36:07.224
IS.

02:36:07.291 --> 02:36:09.526
MAINTAINING AND CLEANING UP OUR

02:36:09.593 --> 02:36:11.829
FORCES IN AWHILE LANDS IN OUR

02:36:11.895 --> 02:36:14.031
URBAN INTERFACE.

02:36:14.098 --> 02:36:15.833
THE LAST TWO ADMINISTRATIONS

02:36:15.899 --> 02:36:17.334
INCLUDING THIS ONE HAVE BEEN

02:36:17.401 --> 02:36:20.204
GOOD ABOUT FINALLY AFTER DECADES

02:36:20.270 --> 02:36:22.773
ATTENDING TO THIS AREA ARE

02:36:22.840 --> 02:36:24.808
PAYING SOME ATTENTION TO IT.

02:36:24.875 --> 02:36:26.176
BUT AS WE LOOK AT THIS CAP AND

02:36:26.243 --> 02:36:27.978
TRADE I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT

02:36:28.045 --> 02:36:29.613
IT'S SUFFICIENT [inaudible]

02:36:29.680 --> 02:36:32.516
EVEN NOW.

02:36:32.583 --> 02:36:34.318
AND YOU DO NOT COMPARE IT WITH

02:36:34.384 --> 02:36:36.120
THE POLLUTION.

02:36:36.186 --> 02:36:38.088
THAT THESE FIRES.

02:36:38.155 --> 02:36:40.057
THEY HAVE CREATED.

02:36:40.124 --> 02:36:41.992
IMPOSED ON US.

02:36:42.059 --> 02:36:44.161
SO WE DO NEED TO GET THE FIRES

02:36:44.228 --> 02:36:46.663
UNDER CONTROL AND UNDER CONTROL

02:36:46.730 --> 02:36:48.398
MEANS MANAGING OUR FORCE AND

02:36:48.465 --> 02:36:50.300
WHILE LANCE SOME OF IT GETS BACK

02:36:50.367 --> 02:36:51.535
TO THE KIND OF PLANES THAT WE

02:36:51.602 --> 02:36:52.936
PUT THE FIRES OUT BUT MOSTLY

02:36:53.003 --> 02:36:54.538
IT'S PREVENTION THAT WE SHOULD

02:36:54.605 --> 02:36:57.007
BE FOCUSING ON IT I'D LIKE TO

02:36:57.074 --> 02:36:57.641
SEE.

02:36:57.708 --> 02:36:59.777
A LOT MORE ATTENTION EVEN IN

02:36:59.843 --> 02:37:04.081
THIS BUDGET TOWARDS THAT END.

02:37:04.148 --> 02:37:05.749
WHERE DO WOOD AND AND I WOULD

02:37:05.816 --> 02:37:07.985
SEE THIS TO BE A IT'S GOT TO BE

02:37:08.051 --> 02:37:11.688
A DECADES OF SUSTAINED EFFORT?

02:37:11.755 --> 02:37:13.223
IS THE ADMINISTRATION.

02:37:13.290 --> 02:37:15.225
REALIZING AND DIRECTING ITS

02:37:15.292 --> 02:37:16.760
ENERGIES TOWARDS THAT SUSTAINED

02:37:16.827 --> 02:37:20.931
PROGRAM OF DIMINISHING.

02:37:20.998 --> 02:37:22.966
THESE GREAT ACCUMULATIONS.

02:37:23.033 --> 02:37:26.136
A FUEL SUPPLIES OF THEM WE

02:37:26.203 --> 02:37:28.138
COULDN'T AGREE MORE THAT THE WE

02:37:28.205 --> 02:37:30.674
WE MIGHT RECALL SB NINE NO ONE

02:37:30.741 --> 02:37:33.510
WHICH THE CAP AND TRADE PACKAGE.

02:37:33.577 --> 02:37:35.846
SUPPORTS WAS ACTUALLY NOT JUST

02:37:35.913 --> 02:37:38.048
TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN NINETEEN

02:37:38.115 --> 02:37:39.783
TWENTY BUT IT WAS A MULTI YEAR

02:37:39.850 --> 02:37:41.151
COMMITMENT AND IS ACTUALLY A

02:37:41.218 --> 02:37:42.886
BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT

02:37:42.953 --> 02:37:45.689
FIVE YEARS. TO GET TO THE VERY

02:37:45.756 --> 02:37:47.057
ISSUE THE THAT YOU'RE RAISING

02:37:47.124 --> 02:37:49.793
AND SO I THINK ONE OF THE IT IS

02:37:49.860 --> 02:37:51.228
SOMETIMES IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:37:51.295 --> 02:37:53.864
CONTEXTUALIZE OF THE THE

02:37:53.931 --> 02:37:55.666
PACKAGES ACCURATE.

02:37:55.732 --> 02:37:56.767
AS THE NUMBERS ARE FOR THE LA

02:37:56.834 --> 02:37:58.502
DOES IT DOES REFLECT JUST KIND

02:37:58.569 --> 02:38:01.605
OF A ONE YEAR SNAPSHOT -- BUT

02:38:01.672 --> 02:38:02.940
IT'S IMPORTANT TO DISTINGUISH

02:38:03.006 --> 02:38:04.341
SAID THERE ARE A COUPLE PROGRAM

02:38:04.408 --> 02:38:06.877
CATEGORY SUCH AS A HEALTHY FORCE

02:38:06.944 --> 02:38:08.745
THAT ACTUALLY WE SELECT A MULTI

02:38:08.812 --> 02:38:10.013
YEAR COMMITMENT WHERE'S MY IN

02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:11.315
SOME OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS ARE

02:38:11.381 --> 02:38:13.917
MORE ON A ON A ONE TIME BASIS SO --

02:38:13.984 --> 02:38:15.519
GETTING YOUR POINT IN TERMS OF

02:38:15.586 --> 02:38:16.820
THE OVERALL INVESTMENT THE

02:38:16.887 --> 02:38:18.121
OVERALL COMMITMENT GIVEN THE

02:38:18.188 --> 02:38:24.394
MAGNITUDE OF THE SITUATION IT IS

02:38:24.461 --> 02:38:24.962
A BILLION DOLLARS OVER FIVE

02:38:25.028 --> 02:38:26.263
YEARS.

02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:27.297
TOWARDS THAT END IN PART.

02:38:27.364 --> 02:38:28.765
IS A NEED TO FOCUS ON CO

02:38:28.832 --> 02:38:31.368
GENERATION CAPACITY.

02:38:31.435 --> 02:38:33.837
THESE FUELS NEED TO GO SOMEWHERE.

02:38:33.904 --> 02:38:36.740
AND OVER DECADES WE HAVE.

02:38:36.807 --> 02:38:38.475
PRETTY MUCH DIMINISH THE TIMBER

02:38:38.542 --> 02:38:41.245
INDUSTRY SO GETTING RID OF LARGE

02:38:41.311 --> 02:38:42.546
TREES AND LOGS.

02:38:42.613 --> 02:38:45.015
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT NOW.

02:38:45.082 --> 02:38:46.950
AND WE HAVE NOT ENCOURAGED IN

02:38:47.017 --> 02:38:49.386
FACT WE DISCOURAGE COGENERATION.

02:38:49.453 --> 02:38:51.221
WHICH CREATES A CAPACITY TO

02:38:51.288 --> 02:38:53.590
REMOVE SOME OF THESE PORTION

02:38:53.657 --> 02:38:55.125
WHILE AND FUELS.

02:38:55.192 --> 02:38:56.293
THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE A

02:38:56.360 --> 02:38:57.494
PART OF THE FUTURE THAT'S NOT A

02:38:57.561 --> 02:38:59.296
PART OF ANYTHING HERE BUT THAT

02:38:59.363 --> 02:39:00.564
DOES NEED TO BE A PART OF OUR

02:39:00.631 --> 02:39:03.867
DIALOGUE AS WE PROCEED.

02:39:03.934 --> 02:39:06.303
SO MARK ME AS YET CONCERNED

02:39:06.370 --> 02:39:08.005
ABOUT HOW FAR WE'RE GOING AND

02:39:08.071 --> 02:39:10.073
HOW MUCH FURTHER WE NEED TO GO.

02:39:10.140 --> 02:39:11.975
AND BIG RUPEE I COMPLIED WITH

02:39:12.042 --> 02:39:13.677
OTHER THINGS TOO THAT CONTRIBUTE

02:39:13.744 --> 02:39:14.845
TO POLLUTION.

02:39:14.912 --> 02:39:16.813
BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THESE FIRES

02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:17.114
[inaudible]

02:39:17.180 --> 02:39:19.583
REGULAR [inaudible]

02:39:19.650 --> 02:39:24.388
IN MY MR MCCARTY.

02:39:24.454 --> 02:39:26.690
YES THANK YOU -- YOU KNOW CAP

02:39:26.757 --> 02:39:28.892
AND TRADE IS A POPULAR TOPIC BY

02:39:28.959 --> 02:39:30.027
WE SPENT.

02:39:30.093 --> 02:39:31.795
AN HOUR HERE RIGHT NOW THAT'S

02:39:31.862 --> 02:39:33.864
WHY LEADERS DOZENS OF BILLS

02:39:33.931 --> 02:39:36.066
INTRODUCED EVERY YEAR CAPTERRA

02:39:36.133 --> 02:39:37.634
BUT HE HAS AN IDEA.

02:39:37.701 --> 02:39:39.469
THIS KIND OF IS IS IS THE P.

02:39:39.536 --> 02:39:41.972
BANK SO -- THAT I'D LIKE TO ONE

02:39:42.039 --> 02:39:43.106
DAY HAVE A CONVERSATION LIKE MR

02:39:43.173 --> 02:39:44.141
MORE LIKE SAID ABOUT THE

02:39:44.207 --> 02:39:46.209
CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION NUMBER

02:39:46.276 --> 02:39:47.778
OF TALKING ABOUT.

02:39:47.844 --> 02:39:49.546
BUT 40% RIGHT HERE.

02:39:49.613 --> 02:39:51.148
THERE ARE 60% THERE'S BIG

02:39:51.214 --> 02:39:52.616
PROJECTS THERE THAT MAY OR MAY

02:39:52.683 --> 02:39:53.583
NOT BE HELPING.

02:39:53.650 --> 02:39:55.686
WITH WHAT OUR ULTIMATE GOALS ARE

02:39:55.752 --> 02:39:56.987
TRYING.

02:39:57.054 --> 02:39:58.689
TO ADDRESS OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT

02:39:58.755 --> 02:40:00.524
IN CLIMATE CHANGE AND SO.

02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:05.562
I GUESS WE'LL HAVE A DISCUSSION.

02:40:05.629 --> 02:40:06.697
NEXT YEAR IS THAT ACCURATE.

02:40:06.763 --> 02:40:07.898
ON THAT.

02:40:07.965 --> 02:40:10.033
ON THE CONTINUOUS FEES -- HIGH I

02:40:10.100 --> 02:40:11.234
MEAN BUT FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE

02:40:11.301 --> 02:40:13.270
THINK THE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

02:40:13.337 --> 02:40:14.538
HAVE THAT DISCUSSION ANYTIME WE

02:40:14.604 --> 02:40:15.772
WOULD LIKE ON KIND OF ON LIKE ON

02:40:15.839 --> 02:40:17.007
THE CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS AS

02:40:17.074 --> 02:40:18.075
WELL AS THE DISCRETIONARY

02:40:18.141 --> 02:40:19.743
EXPENDITURES AND KIND OF WHERE

02:40:19.810 --> 02:40:21.378
IT WHAT IT'S PRIORITIES ARE.

02:40:21.445 --> 02:40:22.713
IT DOESN'T COME UP NEXT YEAR.

02:40:22.779 --> 02:40:23.814
CONTINUOUS THE CONTINUOUS

02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:25.282
APPROPRIATIONS ARE JUST ARE

02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:26.917
CURRENTLY IN LAW THERE IS NO

02:40:26.984 --> 02:40:30.253
SUNSET DATE ON THE CONTINUOUS

02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:31.722
APPROPRIATIONS FACTION.

02:40:31.788 --> 02:40:33.457
BUT THE BIG THING IS IS I I WANT

02:40:33.523 --> 02:40:35.425
I CAN KERR WITH WHAT -- CURTAIN

02:40:35.492 --> 02:40:36.960
SPECIALLY CENTER SKINNER SUMMER

02:40:37.027 --> 02:40:38.562
TING AND IF YOU LOOK AT OUR

02:40:38.628 --> 02:40:40.530
CHALLENGE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S

02:40:40.597 --> 02:40:43.500
REALLY FOCUSED ON ON MOBILE.

02:40:43.567 --> 02:40:45.435
SOURCES AND I THINK WE SHOULD

02:40:45.502 --> 02:40:47.270
FOCUS OUR RESOURCES.

02:40:47.337 --> 02:40:50.007
THERE -- CAN I AM I AM ALL IN IT

02:40:50.073 --> 02:40:51.908
LOOKING AT YOU KNOW THE

02:40:51.975 --> 02:40:54.745
AUTOMOBILE ISSUE AND FOCUSING ON

02:40:54.811 --> 02:40:55.912
HAVING CLEANER.

02:40:55.979 --> 02:41:00.117
PASSENGER CARS -- AS AS WELL AS

02:41:00.183 --> 02:41:02.652
INDUSTRIAL INCLUDING AG CAR CARS

02:41:02.719 --> 02:41:03.954
BUT IT'S NOT JUST ALWAYS THAT

02:41:04.021 --> 02:41:06.356
THE REBATE PROGRAMS BUT IT'S THE

02:41:06.423 --> 02:41:07.791
INFRASTRUCTURE TO I KNOW THAT --

02:41:07.858 --> 02:41:09.259
MISTER TEENS TALKING ABOUT THAT

02:41:09.326 --> 02:41:10.927
FOR EXAMPLE I'M GOING TO THE

02:41:10.994 --> 02:41:12.195
DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION IF YOU ARE

02:41:12.262 --> 02:41:14.498
LIKE MANY OF US WE HAVE ELECTRIC

02:41:14.564 --> 02:41:16.266
VEHICLE DRIVING THERE.

02:41:16.333 --> 02:41:17.868
I'M NOT SURE IN A PARK IN TURGID

02:41:17.934 --> 02:41:19.302
THAT'S THAT'S MY CHALLENGER

02:41:19.369 --> 02:41:20.203
KNOCKS THE DAD'S.

02:41:20.270 --> 02:41:21.705
A RANGE OF TWO HUNDRED MILES

02:41:21.772 --> 02:41:23.173
THAT'S JUST ABOUT THE DISTANCE

02:41:23.240 --> 02:41:23.807
AND SO.

02:41:23.874 --> 02:41:26.543
THOSE ISSUES ARE REAL NOT JUST --

02:41:26.610 --> 02:41:28.912
THE REMAINS SO I THINK THAT WE

02:41:28.979 --> 02:41:29.746
NEED.

02:41:29.813 --> 02:41:30.947
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND

02:41:31.014 --> 02:41:32.549
UNDERSTAND FROM WE TALKED

02:41:32.616 --> 02:41:33.316
EARLIER FROM THE FROM THE

02:41:33.383 --> 02:41:35.819
FINANCE FOREST'S COMPARISONS.

02:41:35.886 --> 02:41:37.854
TO THE SOLAR INDUSTRY AND

02:41:37.921 --> 02:41:40.924
INCENTIVIZE AND JUMP START --

02:41:40.991 --> 02:41:42.626
THIS ANTI AND BUT WE DO HAVE

02:41:42.692 --> 02:41:45.328
THAT -- THE MONEY IN THERE FOR A

02:41:45.395 --> 02:41:47.230
ARE BE TO DO THE RESEARCH ON THE

02:41:47.297 --> 02:41:49.199
INDUSTRY AND COURSE THERE'S

02:41:49.266 --> 02:41:54.004
ISSUES ON BATTERIES AND SO FORTH

02:41:54.071 --> 02:41:56.673
BUT FROM THE LA -- WHAT WHAT

02:41:56.740 --> 02:41:59.409
OTHER?

02:41:59.476 --> 02:42:00.043
WHAT ELSE YOU WOULD BE DOING TO

02:42:00.110 --> 02:42:00.844
IT IF WE ARE TO GET TO THIS

02:42:00.911 --> 02:42:02.579
MAGICAL?

02:42:02.646 --> 02:42:04.414
CALL WHICH IS THE LOFTY AT A

02:42:04.481 --> 02:42:05.315
FIVE MILLION CLEAN VEHICLES IN

02:42:05.382 --> 02:42:06.917
CALIFORNIA.

02:42:06.983 --> 02:42:08.552
IS PLUGGING ALONG AT THIS IS

02:42:08.618 --> 02:42:10.720
THIS ADEQUATE THIS GOING TO GET

02:42:10.787 --> 02:42:13.190
US THERE WERE WHAT ELSE --

02:42:13.256 --> 02:42:15.358
SHOULD BE DOING OTHER THINGS WE

02:42:15.425 --> 02:42:17.661
OUGHT TO BE TAKING A LOOK AT I

02:42:17.727 --> 02:42:18.862
MEAN I I THINK THAT'S A GOOD AND

02:42:18.929 --> 02:42:20.630
AND DIFFICULT QUESTION AS THERE

02:42:20.697 --> 02:42:22.799
IS -- THE STATE I THINK IS

02:42:22.866 --> 02:42:24.734
ALREADY DOING QUITE A BIT SO WE

02:42:24.801 --> 02:42:25.836
HAVE SEVERAL DIFFERENT PROGRAMS

02:42:25.902 --> 02:42:27.304
I MEAN ON IN THIS PACKAGE WE'RE

02:42:27.370 --> 02:42:28.572
LOOKING AT THE CLEAN VEHICLE

02:42:28.638 --> 02:42:30.040
REBATE PROJECT AND KIND OF YOU

02:42:30.107 --> 02:42:31.274
KNOW THE INCENTIVES THAT ARE

02:42:31.341 --> 02:42:32.509
PROVIDED THROUGH THAT -- NO

02:42:32.576 --> 02:42:34.544
STATE HAS OTHER PROGRAMS TO AND

02:42:34.611 --> 02:42:35.846
THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM WAS

02:42:35.912 --> 02:42:37.714
MENTIONED EARLIER -- FOR THE

02:42:37.781 --> 02:42:40.083
EASY CHARGING -- YOUR CARD HAS A

02:42:40.150 --> 02:42:42.552
A REGULATION THAT REQUIRES --

02:42:42.619 --> 02:42:44.254
MANY FACTORS TO PRODUCE A

02:42:44.321 --> 02:42:46.323
CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF ZERO

02:42:46.389 --> 02:42:47.691
EMISSION VEHICLES.

02:42:47.757 --> 02:42:49.860
THE STATE HAS A LOW CARBON FUEL

02:42:49.926 --> 02:42:52.295
STANDARD PROGRAM WHICH YOU KNOW

02:42:52.362 --> 02:42:55.165
INTO PROVIDING SOME SUBSIDIES --

02:42:55.232 --> 02:42:56.266
FOR ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AS

02:42:56.333 --> 02:42:58.135
WELL SO THERE THERE'S KIND OF A

02:42:58.201 --> 02:42:59.870
A SUITE OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS

02:42:59.936 --> 02:43:01.438
THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW -- THAT

02:43:01.505 --> 02:43:03.874
ARE ARE ARE MEANT TO ENCOURAGE.

02:43:03.940 --> 02:43:05.041
YOU ADOPTION OF ZERO EMISSION

02:43:05.108 --> 02:43:06.810
VEHICLES I THINK THE QUESTION OF

02:43:06.877 --> 02:43:07.878
WHETHER OR NOT.

02:43:07.944 --> 02:43:09.412
THAT'S ENOUGH I DON'T KNOW THAT

02:43:09.479 --> 02:43:10.981
THERE HAS BEEN SORT OF AN

02:43:11.047 --> 02:43:12.949
ANALYSIS OF OF WHAT EXACTLY

02:43:13.016 --> 02:43:13.950
WOULD BE NEEDED TO KNOW WHAT WE

02:43:14.017 --> 02:43:14.985
WOULD NEED TO PROVIDE IN TERMS

02:43:15.051 --> 02:43:16.086
OF INCENTIVES OR OR OTHER

02:43:16.153 --> 02:43:17.687
PROGRAMS TO KIND OF ACTUALLY HIT

02:43:17.754 --> 02:43:20.157
THAT GOAL -- SO AT YOU KNOW IT I

02:43:20.223 --> 02:43:21.525
THINK THEY'RE KIND OF MORE WORK

02:43:21.591 --> 02:43:22.159
TO BE DONE AND KIND OF THINKING

02:43:22.225 --> 02:43:23.026
THROUGH YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT

02:43:23.093 --> 02:43:24.561
LEVELS OF FUNDING MIGHT BE

02:43:24.628 --> 02:43:37.641
NEEDED FOR EXAMPLE. EIGHT SEVEN

02:43:37.707 --> 02:43:39.676
OTHER PROGRAMS HE HERE IF WE PUT

02:43:39.743 --> 02:43:42.212
IT ALL TO THAT FOR EXAMPLE IN

02:43:42.279 --> 02:43:42.746
THEM.

02:43:42.812 --> 02:43:44.748
HELLO CARBON TRANSPORTATION FUND

02:43:44.814 --> 02:43:45.782
FOR TWO YEARS YOU KNOW WOULD

02:43:45.849 --> 02:43:47.884
THAT GET US TO A POINT WHERE WE

02:43:47.951 --> 02:43:48.652
GET.

02:43:48.718 --> 02:43:50.120
TO DEFINE ON FIVE MILLION CARS

02:43:50.187 --> 02:43:51.488
OR YOU SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT

02:43:51.555 --> 02:43:52.756
SOMETHING LIKE THAT KNOWING THAT

02:43:52.822 --> 02:43:54.824
THIS IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST

02:43:54.891 --> 02:43:57.661
FACTOR WE NEED TO ADDRESS.

02:43:57.727 --> 02:43:59.896
I MEAN I THINK.

02:43:59.963 --> 02:44:01.264
YOU KNOW IT'S JUST THIS PUTTING

02:44:01.331 --> 02:44:03.600
MORE MONEY INTO THAT PROGRAM IS

02:44:03.667 --> 02:44:06.236
IS ONE OPTION WORTH CONSIDERING

02:44:06.303 --> 02:44:09.039
AND I THINK THAT JUST THE THE

02:44:09.105 --> 02:44:14.377
JUST TO POINT THESE OTHER

02:44:14.444 --> 02:44:14.945
PROGRAMS THAT WOULD PROVIDE

02:44:15.011 --> 02:44:16.146
VALUABLE BENEFITS WOULDN'T GET

02:44:16.213 --> 02:44:19.382
THAT MONEY BUT I THINK THINKING

02:44:19.449 --> 02:44:19.716
BIG.

02:44:19.783 --> 02:44:21.651
AND BIG PICTURE ABOUT KIND OF

02:44:21.718 --> 02:44:22.919
WHAT THE STATE'S ROLE IS AN

02:44:22.986 --> 02:44:23.954
REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS

02:44:24.020 --> 02:44:25.689
EMISSIONS AND HOW THE STATE CAN

02:44:25.755 --> 02:44:27.724
KIND OF YOU KNOW ADOPTED

02:44:27.791 --> 02:44:29.459
POLICIES OR PUSH TECHNOLOGIES

02:44:29.526 --> 02:44:30.794
WHICH THEN CAN BE KIND OF

02:44:30.860 --> 02:44:33.129
EXPORTED TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS

02:44:33.196 --> 02:44:34.531

ACCESS TO CALIFORNIANS.

02:46:28.578 --> 02:46:29.846
THE LEGISLATION WOULD ESTABLISH

02:46:29.913 --> 02:46:31.381
A SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING

PROGRAM IF YOU TURN THE PAGE --

02:47:40.283 --> 02:47:41.584
YOU'LL SEE THAT THE SENATE

02:47:41.651 --> 02:47:43.987
REJECTED THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

02:47:44.053 --> 02:47:45.221
AND I DROPPED THE TRAILER BILL

SENATE BILL.

02:47:58.368 --> 02:47:58.968
TWO HUNDRED WHICH WOULD

02:47:59.035 --> 02:48:00.236
ESTABLISH THAT SAFE AND

02:48:00.303 --> 02:48:01.805
AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER FUND

02:48:01.871 --> 02:48:03.406
TO HELP WATER SYSTEMS PROVIDING

02:48:03.473 --> 02:48:05.308
ADEQUATE AND AFFORDABLE SUPPLIES

02:48:05.375 --> 02:48:06.676
SAFE DRINKING WATER.

02:48:06.743 --> 02:48:08.211
THE ASSEMBLY SET ASIDE FOUR

02:48:08.278 --> 02:48:10.380
POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND

02:48:10.447 --> 02:48:11.981
PENDING FUTURE AGREEMENT ON THE

02:48:12.048 --> 02:48:13.983
ESTABLISHMENT THE SAFE AND

02:48:14.050 --> 02:48:14.651
AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER

02:48:14.717 --> 02:48:15.652
PROGRAM.

02:48:15.718 --> 02:48:17.153
AND DEFERRED ACTION ON THE

02:48:17.220 --> 02:48:19.022
CREATION OF THE PROGRAM IN THE

02:48:19.088 --> 02:48:20.223
FOR THE ISSUE TO THE LEGISLATIVE --

02:48:20.290 --> 02:48:24.127
POLICY COMMITTEES FOR FURTHER

02:48:24.194 --> 02:48:25.261
CONSIDERATION.

02:48:25.328 --> 02:48:26.062
SO WE WE NOTE THAT BOTH HOUSES

02:48:26.129 --> 02:48:27.697
HAVE SHOWN CONSISTENT INTEREST

02:48:27.764 --> 02:48:28.898
IN MOVING FORWARD.

02:48:28.965 --> 02:48:31.568
ON THE POLICY TO PROVIDE ACCESS

02:48:31.634 --> 02:48:33.002
TO CLEAN AFFORDABLE ACCESSIBLE

02:48:33.069 --> 02:48:34.237
DRINKING WATER AT ALL

02:48:34.304 --> 02:48:35.205
CALIFORNIANS.

02:48:35.271 --> 02:48:36.439
AND THEY'RE CURRENTLY BILLS IN

02:48:36.506 --> 02:48:38.308
BOTH HOUSES THAT WOULD IMPLEMENT

02:48:38.374 --> 02:48:41.344
PROGRAM SIMILAR TO WHAT IS BEING

02:48:41.411 --> 02:48:42.378
PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR.

02:48:42.445 --> 02:48:43.813
WE HAVE LOOKED AT ALTERNATIVE

02:48:43.880 --> 02:48:45.615
FUNDING SOURCES FOR THE THE

02:48:45.682 --> 02:48:47.617
PROGRAM A SPECIFIC WILLIE WE'VE

02:48:47.684 --> 02:48:49.352
LOOKED AT BOND FINDING BUT WE

02:48:49.419 --> 02:48:49.853
DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE

02:48:49.919 --> 02:48:50.920
APPROPRIATE.

02:48:50.987 --> 02:48:53.022
BECAUSE BOND PROVIDE ONE TIME

02:48:53.089 --> 02:48:54.390
FIND SOURCES AND SHOULD NOT BE

02:48:54.457 --> 02:48:56.893
RELIED ON AS A SOURCE OF FUNDING

02:48:56.960 --> 02:48:59.295
FOR AN ONGOING PROGRAM -- AND

02:48:59.362 --> 02:49:01.898
ALSO WE LOOKED AT SPECIAL FUNDS

02:49:01.965 --> 02:49:03.099
HOWEVER WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

02:49:03.166 --> 02:49:04.767
IDENTIFY SPECIAL FUND WHERE IT

02:49:04.834 --> 02:49:06.436
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO USE THE

02:49:06.503 --> 02:49:07.637
FUNDS FOR THESE PURPOSES.

02:49:07.704 --> 02:49:09.072
AND IT ALSO HAS A SUFFICIENT

02:49:09.138 --> 02:49:11.841
BALLOTS THAT IT COULD PAY FOR

02:49:11.908 --> 02:49:13.776
THE PROGRAM -- WHEN ALTERNATIVE

02:49:13.843 --> 02:49:14.744
THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT IS THE

02:49:14.811 --> 02:49:16.913
GENERAL FUND AND WE THINK THAT'S

02:49:16.980 --> 02:49:19.182
AN APPROPRIATE -- FUNDING SOURCE

02:49:19.249 --> 02:49:20.116
FOR THE PROGRAM.

02:49:20.183 --> 02:49:21.384
WE WOULD NOTE THAT --

02:49:21.451 --> 02:49:23.353
HISTORICALLY WE'VE HAD CONCERNS

02:49:23.419 --> 02:49:25.355
ABOUT CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS

02:49:25.421 --> 02:49:26.923
BECAUSE THEY TEND TO CONSTRAIN

02:49:26.990 --> 02:49:29.359
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT HOWEVER IF

02:49:29.425 --> 02:49:30.927
THE LEGISLATURE DID.

02:49:30.994 --> 02:49:32.262
CHOOSE TO GO THIS ROUTE.

02:49:32.328 --> 02:49:33.796
THERE ARE SOME OPTIONS THAT

02:49:33.863 --> 02:49:34.664
COULD HELP WITH OVERSIGHT AND

02:49:34.731 --> 02:49:36.799
FUTURE FOR EXAMPLE REPORTING

02:49:36.866 --> 02:49:38.568
REQUIREMENTS I'D BE HAPPY TO

02:49:38.635 --> 02:49:39.903
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

02:49:39.969 --> 02:49:41.271
THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S HEAR

02:49:41.337 --> 02:49:43.273
FROM FINANCE. TO BRIEF COMMENTS

02:49:43.339 --> 02:49:44.874
FIRST THE GOVERNOR CONTINUES TO

02:49:44.941 --> 02:49:46.309
BELIEVE THAT WE NEED A DEDICATED

02:49:46.376 --> 02:49:48.144
ONGOING SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR

02:49:48.211 --> 02:49:49.279
SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING

02:49:49.345 --> 02:49:50.547
WATER.

02:49:50.613 --> 02:49:51.614
AND THE SECOND IN IS MAY

02:49:51.681 --> 02:49:52.649
REVISION PRESS CONFERENCE THE

02:49:52.715 --> 02:49:54.217
GOVERNOR EXPRESSED AN INTEREST

02:49:54.284 --> 02:49:55.485
IN WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU TO

02:49:55.552 --> 02:49:56.653
FIND WHERE THAT ONGOING SOURCE

02:49:56.719 --> 02:49:58.354
CAN BE WE CONTINUE TO STAND

02:49:58.421 --> 02:50:02.258
BEHIND OUR MAY REVISION PROPOSAL

02:50:02.325 --> 02:50:02.892
BUT WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS

02:50:02.959 --> 02:50:04.394
A ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT

02:50:04.460 --> 02:50:04.561
THIS

02:50:04.627 --> 02:50:06.396
INDEED QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS MR

02:50:06.462 --> 02:50:08.264
OBERNOLTE.

02:50:08.331 --> 02:50:10.199
SO I WOULD HOPE I SPEAK FOR

02:50:10.266 --> 02:50:12.001
EVERYONE ON THIS DíAS THAT.

02:50:12.068 --> 02:50:14.270
WE ABSOLUTELY BELIEVE WE NEED TO

02:50:14.337 --> 02:50:15.905
PROVIDE CLEAR AND AFFORDABLE

02:50:15.972 --> 02:50:16.873
DRINKING WATER TO CALIFORNIANS

02:50:16.940 --> 02:50:18.508
AND THE TO THE EXTENT THAT THEIR

02:50:18.575 --> 02:50:19.842
PLACES IN THE STATE WHERE THE

02:50:19.909 --> 02:50:21.210
DOES NOT OCCUR.

02:50:21.277 --> 02:50:22.579
I SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR US.

02:50:22.645 --> 02:50:25.915
BUT WE DON'T WERE RIGHT NOW IN

02:50:25.982 --> 02:50:27.684
HERE WHEN WE'RE PROJECTING A

02:50:27.750 --> 02:50:28.651
TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET

02:50:28.718 --> 02:50:30.053
SURPLUS AND THAT'S WHY SHE IS SO

02:50:30.119 --> 02:50:31.988
DIFFICULT. TO TALK ABOUT

02:50:32.055 --> 02:50:33.690
IMPOSING NEW TAXES ON

02:50:33.756 --> 02:50:34.924
CALIFORNIANS.

02:50:34.991 --> 02:50:37.093
I THINK THE SITUATION MIGHT BE

02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:38.494
DIFFERENT IF.

02:50:38.561 --> 02:50:40.663
WE WERE.

02:50:40.730 --> 02:50:42.198
HEY FACING A DEFICIT AND WE WERE

02:50:42.265 --> 02:50:43.666
HAVING OF CUT OTHER -- OTHER

02:50:43.733 --> 02:50:45.201
PLACES BUT WHICH IS REALLY

02:50:45.268 --> 02:50:46.402
DIFFICULT FOR US TO GO BACK TO

02:50:46.469 --> 02:50:47.670
OUR CONSTITUENTS AND EXPLAIN TO

02:50:47.737 --> 02:50:48.805
THEM WHY.

02:50:48.871 --> 02:50:50.607
WE HAD TWENTY ONE BILLION

02:50:50.673 --> 02:50:53.443
DOLLARS EXTRA AND YET WE ELECTED

02:50:53.509 --> 02:50:55.311
TO ADD A TAX -- AND THE OTHER

02:50:55.378 --> 02:50:56.412
THING I WANT TO SAY ABOUT THE

02:50:56.479 --> 02:50:58.014
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS THAT THIS

02:50:58.081 --> 02:51:00.617
THE TAX AND PARTICULARLY THE TAX

02:51:00.683 --> 02:51:02.051
ON THE COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS.

02:51:02.118 --> 02:51:05.054
WHICH IS THE BULK OF THE REVENUE.

02:51:05.121 --> 02:51:06.422
IT'S IT'S A PARTICULARLY

02:51:06.489 --> 02:51:08.558
REGRESSIVE TAX MEANING THAT IT'S

02:51:08.625 --> 02:51:11.527
DISPROPORTIONATELY BORNE BY THE

02:51:11.594 --> 02:51:12.161
PEOPLE WHO CAN LEAST AFFORD TO

02:51:12.228 --> 02:51:13.963
PAY AT THE ONE WHEN WE ENACT

02:51:14.030 --> 02:51:15.632
THOSE KIND OF TAXES INVARIABLY

02:51:15.698 --> 02:51:16.866
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS RAISING THE

02:51:16.933 --> 02:51:18.401
COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA.

02:51:18.468 --> 02:51:19.302
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I HAVE

02:51:19.369 --> 02:51:20.570
A PROBLEM WITH THAT I THINK A

02:51:20.637 --> 02:51:21.838
LOT OF US HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

02:51:21.904 --> 02:51:23.606
BECAUSE MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS

02:51:23.673 --> 02:51:25.475
ARE ALREADY FACING CHALLENGES.

02:51:25.541 --> 02:51:27.477
IN AFFORDING THEIR BASIC

02:51:27.543 --> 02:51:29.612
NECESSITIES AND OF WHICH WATER

02:51:29.679 --> 02:51:31.247
IS ONE OF THEM SO -- I I'M

02:51:31.314 --> 02:51:34.484
REALLY HOPING THAT WE CAN COME.

02:51:34.550 --> 02:51:35.852
TO SOME KIND OF AGREEMENT THAT

02:51:35.918 --> 02:51:37.787
WERE WE FIND A HUNDRED FIFTY

02:51:37.854 --> 02:51:38.454
MILLION DOLLARS TO FUND THIS ON

02:51:38.521 --> 02:51:40.189
THE GENERAL FUND SO THAT WE

02:51:40.256 --> 02:51:41.157
DON'T HAVE TO IMPOSE THAT TAX.

02:51:41.224 --> 02:51:45.795
ON CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE IT'S A

02:51:45.862 --> 02:51:46.763
VERY DIFFICULT THING TO JUSTIFY.

02:51:46.829 --> 02:51:48.631
THANK YOU MISTER TING.

02:51:48.698 --> 02:51:50.166
THANKS I MEAN I I COMPLETELY

02:51:50.233 --> 02:51:51.300
AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE

02:51:51.367 --> 02:51:53.503
PAIR THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO

02:51:53.569 --> 02:51:54.671
PROVIDE CLEAN AFFORDABLE

02:51:54.737 --> 02:51:56.906
DRINKING WATER FOR EVERYBODY IN

02:51:56.973 --> 02:51:58.408
THE STATE AND FACT I'M.

02:51:58.474 --> 02:52:01.611
SORT OF LITTLE BIT SHOCKED THAT

02:52:01.678 --> 02:52:03.446
SIX YEARS AFTER BEING UP HERE WE

02:52:03.513 --> 02:52:05.515
DOES MY SEVENTY WE HAVEN'T DONE

02:52:05.581 --> 02:52:08.117
IT YET -- HAVING SAID THAT YOU

02:52:08.184 --> 02:52:08.785
KNOW AS WELL NO.

02:52:08.851 --> 02:52:10.987
ONCE WE WAIT AND TELL WATER

02:52:11.054 --> 02:52:12.755
ISSUES ISSUES ARE.

02:52:12.822 --> 02:52:14.157
THEM MOST COMPLEX IN THE STATE I

02:52:14.223 --> 02:52:14.991
DON'T THINK THERE'S AN ISSUE

02:52:15.058 --> 02:52:18.027
THAT'S MORE COMPLEX OR MORE

02:52:18.094 --> 02:52:19.829
CHALLENGING THE STATE THAN WATER.

02:52:19.896 --> 02:52:22.198
HAVING SAID THAT THE THE WATER

02:52:22.265 --> 02:52:24.233
WASN'T POLLUTED BY.

02:52:24.300 --> 02:52:26.202
THE ENVIRONMENT OR BY NATURE THE

02:52:26.269 --> 02:52:27.837
WATER WAS POLLUTED BY.

02:52:27.904 --> 02:52:29.505
PEOPLE.

02:52:29.572 --> 02:52:31.007
AND I THINK THAT THE BIG THE BIG

02:52:31.074 --> 02:52:32.108
CHALLENGES I THINK THE BIGGEST

02:52:32.175 --> 02:52:33.509
CHALLENGE.

02:52:33.576 --> 02:52:35.478
IS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS

02:52:35.545 --> 02:52:36.879
REMEDIATION.

02:52:36.946 --> 02:52:39.082
DONE BY THE PEOPLE IN THE

02:52:39.148 --> 02:52:40.983
ENTITIES THAT.

02:52:41.050 --> 02:52:41.584
CREATED THE POLLUTION I THINK

02:52:41.651 --> 02:52:42.885
THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST

02:52:42.952 --> 02:52:45.221
CHALLENGES ON IS THAT MAKING

02:52:45.288 --> 02:52:47.023
SURE THAT AGAIN.

02:52:47.090 --> 02:52:47.623
WITH MUCH OF OUR REMEDIATION

02:52:47.690 --> 02:52:48.925
WHICH HAS BEEN A LONG LONG TIME

02:52:48.991 --> 02:52:50.226
DISCUSSING CAP AND TRADE THAT

02:52:50.293 --> 02:52:52.829
THERE ACTUALLY IS -- ENSURING

02:52:52.895 --> 02:52:54.163
THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE.

02:52:54.230 --> 02:52:56.399
MEDIATION BY THE POLLUTERS WHO

02:52:56.466 --> 02:52:57.867
BECAUSE THE POLLUTION WHO

02:52:57.934 --> 02:52:59.335
POLLUTED DRINKING WATER WHO MADE

02:52:59.402 --> 02:53:00.870
IT SO THAT THE WATER WAS NOT

02:53:00.937 --> 02:53:02.605
DRINKABLE THE WATER DID NOT

02:53:02.672 --> 02:53:03.473
START OFF THAT WAY.

02:53:03.539 --> 02:53:05.341
ALSO THE OTHER PIECE OF IT IS IS

02:53:05.408 --> 02:53:08.678
WE HAVE ON MANY SMALL WATER

02:53:08.745 --> 02:53:10.513
DISTRICTS UP AND DOWN THE STATE

02:53:10.580 --> 02:53:11.948
WHO REALLY.

02:53:12.014 --> 02:53:13.483
HAVE PROVED.

02:53:13.549 --> 02:53:15.685
INADEQUATE TO REALLY DO THE JOB

02:53:15.752 --> 02:53:18.521
OF MANAGING WATER OR TO

02:53:18.588 --> 02:53:20.256
DISTRIBUTE THE WATER TO

02:53:20.323 --> 02:53:21.924
HOUSEHOLDS TO DIFFERENT PLACES.

02:53:21.991 --> 02:53:24.627
I THINK THAT HARM IN ORDER TO

02:53:24.694 --> 02:53:26.629
ASSURE THAT WE ACTUALLY FIX THIS

02:53:26.696 --> 02:53:28.397
PROBLEM WE CAN'T.

02:53:28.464 --> 02:53:31.868
JUST -- PAY MONEY AND ASSUME

02:53:31.934 --> 02:53:34.103
THIS'LL BE CLEAN CLEAN UP WE

02:53:34.170 --> 02:53:36.272
HAVE TO ENSURE AGAIN THAT THE

02:53:36.339 --> 02:53:37.540
POLLUTERS A PAYING PLAYERS ARE

02:53:37.607 --> 02:53:39.442
POLLUTING LAST AND THEN ON TOP

02:53:39.509 --> 02:53:39.942
OF THAT THAT.

02:53:40.009 --> 02:53:41.611
THERE IS SOME CONSOLIDATION OF

02:53:41.677 --> 02:53:42.745
MANY OF THESE WATER DISTRICTS

02:53:42.812 --> 02:53:44.547
WHO AGAIN DID NOT SOUND THE

02:53:44.614 --> 02:53:46.249
ALARM BELLS TO NOT REALLY RAISE

02:53:46.315 --> 02:53:47.383
THE ISSUE.

02:53:47.450 --> 02:53:48.684
INTEL REALLY GOT TOO LATE I

02:53:48.751 --> 02:53:52.388
THINK THERE HAS TO BE A SORT OF

02:53:52.455 --> 02:53:54.690
A MUCH -- A MUCH BROADER FIX

02:53:54.757 --> 02:53:55.324
THAT THE HOPE IS THE ISSUE THAT

02:53:55.391 --> 02:53:55.958
WE CAN.

02:53:56.025 --> 02:53:56.859
REACH THAT WHETHER TO THE BUDGET

02:53:56.926 --> 02:53:57.794
OR WHETHER IT'S THROUGH A

02:53:57.860 --> 02:53:59.595
SEPARATE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BY

02:53:59.662 --> 02:54:01.664
THINK THE HOPE REALLY IS -- THAT

02:54:01.731 --> 02:54:03.800
WE CAN GET TO THAT GET TO THIS

02:54:03.866 --> 02:54:05.034
ISSUE THIS YEAR.

02:54:05.101 --> 02:54:07.303
AGAIN IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS JUST

02:54:07.370 --> 02:54:08.738
APPROPRIATING MONEY BUT IT'S

02:54:08.805 --> 02:54:10.406
IT'S REALLY TO THE CONSOLIDATION

02:54:10.473 --> 02:54:12.508
OF THESE WATER DISTRICTS THAT

02:54:12.575 --> 02:54:14.477
THERE IS -- GREAT RESPONSIBILITY

02:54:14.544 --> 02:54:18.481
TAKEN BY THOSE WHO BELIEVE WE'RE

02:54:18.548 --> 02:54:19.048
A SLEEP.

02:54:19.115 --> 02:54:20.016
SLEEP AT THE WHEEL AND THEN

02:54:20.082 --> 02:54:21.217
AGAIN MAKING SURE THAT THE

02:54:21.284 --> 02:54:23.920
POLLUTERS WHO POLLUTED THE WATER --

02:54:23.986 --> 02:54:26.956
HAVE TO PAY FOR SOME OF THAT

02:54:27.023 --> 02:54:29.959
REMEDIATION. FOR THE NIELSEN.

02:54:30.026 --> 02:54:31.360
THIS IS A BIG ISSUE AND I

02:54:31.427 --> 02:54:33.162
CERTAINLY WOULD ARGUE FOR THE

02:54:33.229 --> 02:54:34.730
FOR THE SENATE HAS BEEN ON THIS.

02:54:34.797 --> 02:54:37.900
THE DEDICATION OF A GENERAL FUND

02:54:37.967 --> 02:54:39.669
APPROPRIATION. FOR WHERE WE'RE

02:54:39.735 --> 02:54:42.905
AT NOW -- THAT I THINK WE'RE

02:54:42.972 --> 02:54:44.607
PRETTY MATURED AND CERTAINLY BE

02:54:44.674 --> 02:54:46.642
TALKING ABOUT A TAX INCREASES

02:54:46.709 --> 02:54:48.477
AND THOSE ARE NOT WIRED TO

02:54:48.544 --> 02:54:51.280
WILDLY EMBRACED.

02:54:51.347 --> 02:54:52.949
AND MANY THINGS HAVE BEEN DONE.

02:54:53.015 --> 02:54:55.785
THROUGH MANY AUTHORITIES TO GET

02:54:55.852 --> 02:55:00.256
OUT OUR ISSUES OF WATER SUPPLY

02:55:00.323 --> 02:55:00.556
[inaudible]

02:55:00.623 --> 02:55:02.792
WATER QUALITY [inaudible]

02:55:02.859 --> 02:55:05.294
REPLENISHING AQUIFER'S

02:55:05.361 --> 02:55:05.595
[inaudible]

02:55:05.661 --> 02:55:07.997
SERVICE STORAGE.

02:55:08.064 --> 02:55:09.899
CONVEYANCE SYSTEMS.

02:55:09.966 --> 02:55:10.967
IT'S A VERY COMPLICATED

02:55:11.033 --> 02:55:11.267
[inaudible]

02:55:11.334 --> 02:55:14.303
AREA.

02:55:14.370 --> 02:55:17.640
THE END YES THERE ARE PROBLEMS.

02:55:17.707 --> 02:55:18.474
BUT WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC

02:55:18.541 --> 02:55:20.476
ABOUT IT.

02:55:20.543 --> 02:55:22.078
AND IN TERMS OF JUST THE

02:55:22.144 --> 02:55:23.946
SPECIFIC TAX THAT HAS BEEN

02:55:24.013 --> 02:55:25.748
DISCUSSED.

02:55:25.815 --> 02:55:27.283
THERE'S BROAD AND VERY STRONG

02:55:27.350 --> 02:55:28.951
OPPOSITION TO THAT I JUST NEED

02:55:29.018 --> 02:55:31.921
TO GET THAT ON THE RECORD.

02:55:31.988 --> 02:55:37.326
THANK YOU SIR. FOR TO EVER --

02:55:37.393 --> 02:55:38.327
AND I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES

02:55:38.394 --> 02:55:40.496
THE BEEN SEVEN YEARS NOW AND

02:55:40.563 --> 02:55:42.865
EVER SINCE I CAME UP HERE THE

02:55:42.932 --> 02:55:44.300
DISCUSSION HAS BEEN ABOUT WATER.

02:55:44.367 --> 02:55:47.603
AND I HAVE BEEN -- SHOCKED AND

02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:50.840
EMBARRASSED. TO BE A CALIFORNIA.

02:55:50.907 --> 02:55:52.975
AND TO HAVE PEOPLE IN THE STATE

02:55:53.042 --> 02:55:53.576
WHO DON'T HAVE CLEAN DRINKING

02:55:53.643 --> 02:55:54.410
WATER.

02:55:54.477 --> 02:55:56.512
YOU KNOW I CAN GO TO THIRD WORLD

02:55:56.579 --> 02:55:57.847
COUNTRIES AND SEE THINGS

02:55:57.914 --> 02:55:59.248
SOMETIMES LIKE THAT BUT MORE

02:55:59.315 --> 02:56:00.583
THAN LIKELY SEE THINGS BETTER

02:56:00.650 --> 02:56:01.651
THAN THAT.

02:56:01.717 --> 02:56:03.185
AND SO THAT TO ME IS VERY

02:56:03.252 --> 02:56:04.854
ALARMING AND WE'RE STILL

02:56:04.921 --> 02:56:06.322
DEBATING THE ISSUE.

02:56:06.389 --> 02:56:08.991
AND TALKING ABOUT TAXING FOLKS

02:56:09.058 --> 02:56:09.392
WHICH IS.

02:56:09.458 --> 02:56:11.027
YOU KNOW WHICH ARE WHICH ARE THE

02:56:11.093 --> 02:56:12.128
GYM WITH THE FOLKS WHO CAN LEAST

02:56:12.194 --> 02:56:13.696
AFFORD IT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE

02:56:13.763 --> 02:56:15.064
THE AREAS ARE IN THE STATE WERE.

02:56:15.131 --> 02:56:16.666
WE LOOKING AT FOLKS WHO DON'T

02:56:16.732 --> 02:56:18.467
HAVE CLEAN DRINKING WATER AND ON

02:56:18.534 --> 02:56:19.635
THAT WATER TO BE THEN.

02:56:19.702 --> 02:56:21.337
AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND

02:56:21.404 --> 02:56:22.872
AND AT SOME POINT I YOU KNOW I'M

02:56:22.939 --> 02:56:25.875
GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE THEY

02:56:25.942 --> 02:56:27.109
HAS TO COME SOME -- OF

02:56:27.176 --> 02:56:27.843
RESPONSIBILITY AT THE STATE

02:56:27.910 --> 02:56:29.412
LEVEL FOR US TO BELIEVE THAT

02:56:29.478 --> 02:56:30.513
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT

02:56:30.579 --> 02:56:32.081
ARE THAT ARE RIGHT THE PEOPLE

02:56:32.148 --> 02:56:32.682
OUT A HALF.

02:56:32.748 --> 02:56:34.450
IN CALIFORNIA IN THE SAME WAY WE

02:56:34.517 --> 02:56:35.952
THINK EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE

02:56:36.018 --> 02:56:37.853
ACCESS TO A QUALITY SCHOOL.

02:56:37.920 --> 02:56:40.056
YOU KNOW A QUALITY KIND OF OF OF

02:56:40.122 --> 02:56:41.057
LIVING ENVIRONMENT OBVIOUSLY

02:56:41.123 --> 02:56:42.925
BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CAP

02:56:42.992 --> 02:56:43.960
AND TRADE A LOT.

02:56:44.026 --> 02:56:45.061
BUT ALSO BE SOME OF THE

02:56:45.127 --> 02:56:46.529
FUNDAMENTAL THINGS AND I ALWAYS

02:56:46.595 --> 02:56:48.731
THOUGHT WATER CLEAN WATER WAS

02:56:48.798 --> 02:56:50.299
ONE OF THOSE FUNDAMENTAL THINGS.

02:56:50.366 --> 02:56:51.734
THAT WE BELIEVED IN BECAUSE THE

02:56:51.801 --> 02:56:55.037
IMPACT OF NOT HAVING CLEAN WATER --

02:56:55.104 --> 02:56:57.073
IN THE STATE LIKE THIS COULD

02:56:57.139 --> 02:56:59.241
HAVE SOME DEVASTATING EFFECTS ON

02:56:59.308 --> 02:57:00.810
OTHERS WITH REGARDS TO HEALTH.

02:57:00.876 --> 02:57:02.044
AND ALL THOSE THINGS IF WE JUST

02:57:02.111 --> 02:57:03.913
CONSTANTLY KICK THIS CAN DOWN

02:57:03.980 --> 02:57:05.581
THE ROAD IGNORE IT -- WE

02:57:05.648 --> 02:57:07.416
RESPONSIBILITY TO SOLVE THIS

02:57:07.483 --> 02:57:09.418
PROBLEM AND THAT MEANS DEALING

02:57:09.485 --> 02:57:09.919
WITH THOSE WHO DONE THE

02:57:09.986 --> 02:57:11.721
POLLUTION IF THAT MEANS PUTTING

02:57:11.787 --> 02:57:12.989
THE RESOURCES FOR WORK.

02:57:13.055 --> 02:57:15.024
THAT WE HOPE TO RECAPTURE IF

02:57:15.091 --> 02:57:16.625
THERE ARE FOLKS WEAKENED A

02:57:16.692 --> 02:57:17.460
DIGNIFIED THAT HAVE THIS A AN

02:57:17.526 --> 02:57:18.027
ISSUE.

02:57:18.094 --> 02:57:19.929
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE NO CALIFORNIAN

02:57:19.996 --> 02:57:21.897
SHOULD EVER EVER LIVE WITHOUT

02:57:21.964 --> 02:57:23.299
CLEAN DRINKING WATER.

02:57:23.366 --> 02:57:25.368
I MEAN WE SPEND LOTS OF TIME

02:57:25.434 --> 02:57:27.436
MANY OF US WHO ARE PHILANTHROPIC

02:57:27.503 --> 02:57:28.838
GOING TO THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES

02:57:28.904 --> 02:57:30.639
BUILDING WELLS AND ALL THIS KIND

02:57:30.706 --> 02:57:32.508
OF STUFF TALKING ABOUT THE

02:57:32.575 --> 02:57:33.809
IMPACT OF CLEAN WATER.

02:57:33.876 --> 02:57:35.378
ON PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND AND

02:57:35.444 --> 02:57:36.579
THEY'RE ALL THE THINGS THAT GO

02:57:36.645 --> 02:57:38.214
ALONG WITH IT AND THEN WE COME

02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:39.915
HOME AFTER DOING THESE WONDERFUL

02:57:39.982 --> 02:57:42.551
EXPERIENCES IN ANOTHER COUNTRY.

02:57:42.618 --> 02:57:43.953
THE BUILDING WELL SOME PEOPLE

02:57:44.020 --> 02:57:45.454
HAVE CLEAN WATER AND NO HAVE

02:57:45.521 --> 02:57:46.889
CLEAN WATER HERE -- AT SOME

02:57:46.956 --> 02:57:48.624
POINT WE HAVE TO BITE THE BULLET.

02:57:48.691 --> 02:57:50.393
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

02:57:50.459 --> 02:57:51.861
SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WE KNOW WHAT

02:57:51.927 --> 02:57:53.295
THE SOLVE IT IS COMPLICATED BUT

02:57:53.362 --> 02:57:54.730
A LOT OF PIECES TO IT.

02:57:54.797 --> 02:57:56.332
BUT IT'S THE SAME TIME WE SHOULD

02:57:56.399 --> 02:57:57.933
BE ABLE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF

02:57:58.000 --> 02:57:59.735
CLEAN DRINKING WATER IN

02:57:59.802 --> 02:58:00.836
CALIFORNIA.

02:58:00.903 --> 02:58:03.105
AND TO NOT DO THAT IS REALLY

02:58:03.172 --> 02:58:04.273
REALLY IN MY MIND IT'S

02:58:04.340 --> 02:58:05.908
EMBARRASSING AS A STATE WITH ALL

02:58:05.975 --> 02:58:08.210
THE HIGH TECH STUFF WE HAVE IN

02:58:08.277 --> 02:58:09.011
ALL THE WEALTHY PEOPLE WHO LIVE

02:58:09.078 --> 02:58:10.379
IN CALIFORNIA.

02:58:10.446 --> 02:58:11.781
AND THE BEAUTIFUL PRISTINE

02:58:11.847 --> 02:58:13.682
ENVIRONMENT WHICH WE HAVE WE

02:58:13.749 --> 02:58:15.084
HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE WATER THEY

02:58:15.151 --> 02:58:16.352
CAN'T DRINK THAT WAS STILL

02:58:16.419 --> 02:58:17.920
TAKING WATER INTO COMMUNITIES.

02:58:17.987 --> 02:58:20.189
OF WHERE THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO

02:58:20.256 --> 02:58:21.557
TURN ON THE TAP AND SEE CLEAN

02:58:21.624 --> 02:58:22.658
WATER AND TAKE A BATH.

02:58:22.725 --> 02:58:30.800
AND SO I YOU KNOW I YOU KNOW I I

02:58:30.866 --> 02:58:31.901
I SEE THIS AS A BUDGET ISSUE

02:58:31.967 --> 02:58:32.735
THAT OUGHT TO BE IN THE BUDGET.

02:58:32.802 --> 02:58:33.202
BECAUSE TO ME THIS IS

02:58:33.269 --> 02:58:34.270
FUNDAMENTAL FOR CALIFORNIA.

02:58:34.336 --> 02:58:35.104
YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:58:35.171 --> 02:58:35.604
TRYING TO GET EVERYBODY

02:58:35.671 --> 02:58:36.405
HEALTHCARE TRYING TO GET

02:58:36.472 --> 02:58:37.373
EVERYBODY IN PRESCHOOL TRYING TO

02:58:37.440 --> 02:58:38.040
GET EVERYBODY AND WE WOULD WOULD

02:58:38.107 --> 02:58:38.974
THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE'RE

02:58:39.041 --> 02:58:40.109
TALKING ABOUT DOING.

02:58:40.176 --> 02:58:42.745
AND YET WE ARE NOT THINKING THAT

02:58:42.812 --> 02:58:43.512
EVERYBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TO TURN

02:58:43.579 --> 02:58:44.647
ON THE TAP.

02:58:44.713 --> 02:58:46.649
AND GET A CLEAN GLASS WATER.

02:58:46.715 --> 02:58:48.317
NO WE DON'T WANNA BE FLIPPED BUT

02:58:48.384 --> 02:58:50.052
WE'RE MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION.

02:58:50.119 --> 02:58:52.388
AND AND AND AND SO TO ME IT'S

02:58:52.455 --> 02:58:54.090
IT'S AN EMBARRASSMENT AND IT IS

02:58:54.156 --> 02:58:56.092
A RESPONSIBILITY OF US WE NEED

02:58:56.158 --> 02:58:57.493
TO FIGURE OUT OF HIS BUDGET FIND

02:58:57.560 --> 02:58:57.927
THE MONEY.

02:58:57.993 --> 02:58:59.929
GET IT DONE AND IF WE NEED TO GO

02:58:59.995 --> 02:59:01.363
AFTER THE PEOPLE WHO DID IT WE

02:59:01.430 --> 02:59:03.099
GO AFTER BUT NO CALIFORNIAN

02:59:03.165 --> 02:59:05.201
SHOULD EVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

02:59:05.267 --> 02:59:07.036
WATER THAT THEY CANNOT DRINK IN

02:59:07.103 --> 02:59:10.106
THEIR OWN COMMUNITY.

02:59:10.172 --> 02:59:11.440
THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.

02:59:11.507 --> 02:59:13.542
THANK YOU FOR THE SKINNER.

02:59:13.609 --> 02:59:14.610
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF ECHO

02:59:14.677 --> 02:59:16.345
THE COMMENTS OF A MY COLLEAGUES

02:59:16.412 --> 02:59:18.481
IN THE ASSEMBLY.

02:59:18.547 --> 02:59:19.648
AND I AM COMFORTABLE.

02:59:19.715 --> 02:59:21.617
WELL I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO

02:59:21.684 --> 02:59:25.488
HOLD THIS OPEN -- AND I KNOW

02:59:25.554 --> 02:59:25.888
THAT.

02:59:25.955 --> 02:59:28.591
THE BOTH HOUSES REJECTED THE

02:59:28.657 --> 02:59:30.993
BROAD TAX ON EVERY INDIVIDUAL

02:59:31.060 --> 02:59:34.497
WATER USER WHICH HIGH AGREED

02:59:34.563 --> 02:59:36.298
BECAUSE I FEEL THAT.

02:59:36.365 --> 02:59:38.501
THE MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA

02:59:38.567 --> 02:59:41.137
WHO FOR NOW DO NOT HAVE ACCESS

02:59:41.203 --> 02:59:42.671
TO SAFE AND HEALTHY DRINKING

02:59:42.738 --> 02:59:44.540
WATER.

02:59:44.607 --> 02:59:46.041
IT IS DUE [inaudible]

02:59:46.108 --> 02:59:47.576
TO SOME POLLUTERS.

02:59:47.643 --> 02:59:49.044
AND IT'S NOT THE SAME POLLUTER

02:59:49.111 --> 02:59:51.347
BUT IT IS KNOWN POLLUTERS.

02:59:51.413 --> 02:59:53.349
AND SO TO ASK EVERY OTHER

02:59:53.415 --> 02:59:56.152
CALIFORNIA. TO COVER THE COST OF

02:59:56.218 --> 02:59:58.120
THESE KNOWN POLLUTERS IS NOT

02:59:58.187 --> 02:59:59.955
APPROPRIATE IN MY MIND NOW

03:00:00.022 --> 03:00:01.457
SOMEONE COULD SAY WELL FOR USE

03:00:01.524 --> 03:00:03.159
GENERAL FUND IN EFFECT WE'RE

03:00:03.225 --> 03:00:04.426
DOING NOW WE'RE BASICALLY HAVING

03:00:04.493 --> 03:00:06.028
THE TAXPAYER.

03:00:06.095 --> 03:00:07.129
SO I GT THAT.

03:00:07.196 --> 03:00:10.900
AND I WOULD ULTIMATELY WANT TO

03:00:10.966 --> 03:00:11.600
SEE US.

03:00:11.667 --> 03:00:13.502
IN APPLYING THE PRINCIPLE OF

03:00:13.569 --> 03:00:14.904
POLLUTER PAYS.

03:00:14.970 --> 03:00:16.372
HOWEVER.

03:00:16.438 --> 03:00:17.873
THERE IS OF THE PROPOSALS THAT

03:00:17.940 --> 03:00:19.808
HAVE BEEN FLOATED SO FAR AROUND

03:00:19.875 --> 03:00:21.210
POLLUTER PAYS.

03:00:21.277 --> 03:00:25.014
READ LEASES THAT POLLUTER FROM --

03:00:25.080 --> 03:00:26.482
A GOOD DEAL OF RESPONSIBILITY

03:00:26.549 --> 03:00:28.017
AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S A FAIR

03:00:28.083 --> 03:00:30.219
WAY TO GO SO.

03:00:30.286 --> 03:00:32.321
I HOPE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE

03:00:32.388 --> 03:00:33.889
THESE CONVERSATIONS AND WORK

03:00:33.956 --> 03:00:36.225
THIS OUT SO THAT WERE NOT

03:00:36.292 --> 03:00:38.227
NECESSARILY ASKING EVERY

03:00:38.294 --> 03:00:39.261
CALIFORNIANS THROUGH THE GENERAL

03:00:39.328 --> 03:00:42.031
FUND OR THROUGH A FEE ON THEIR

03:00:42.097 --> 03:00:42.798
WATER.

03:00:42.865 --> 03:00:44.266
BUT RATHER WE ARE APPLYING THE

03:00:44.333 --> 03:00:45.901
POLLUTER PAY PRINCIPLES BUT IN

03:00:45.968 --> 03:00:47.570
THE MEAN TIME.

03:00:47.636 --> 03:00:49.338
IF WE HAVE TO FALL BACK THEN I

03:00:49.405 --> 03:00:51.907
WOULD RATHER USE THE GENERAL

03:00:51.974 --> 03:00:52.541
FUND.

03:00:52.608 --> 03:00:54.910
THANK YOU SENATOR OFF.

03:00:54.977 --> 03:00:56.745
THANK YOU MANAGER OF THE MONEY

03:00:56.812 --> 03:00:58.414
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- IS

03:00:58.480 --> 03:00:59.949
NOT GOING TO BE USED FOR CAPITAL

03:01:00.015 --> 03:01:01.183
PROJECTS CORRECT BECAUSE HIS

03:01:01.250 --> 03:01:02.685
BOND MONEY FOR THAT IS THAT

03:01:02.751 --> 03:01:06.755
RIGHT.

03:01:06.822 --> 03:01:08.324
SIR DO I GO TO PART OF FINANCE

03:01:08.390 --> 03:01:09.058
THAT'S CORRECT THERE IS

03:01:09.124 --> 03:01:10.226
CURRENTLY BOND FUNDING AND

03:01:10.292 --> 03:01:11.427
FEDERAL FUNDING THAT GOES FOR

03:01:11.493 --> 03:01:12.695
THE CAP INFRASTRUCTURE.

03:01:12.761 --> 03:01:14.163
AS A PRIMARY FOCUS ON THE

03:01:14.230 --> 03:01:15.731
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE ON

03:01:15.798 --> 03:01:17.066
OTHER KIND OF EMERGENCY DRINKING

03:01:17.132 --> 03:01:19.134
WATER NEEDS -- WHERE THE BOND

03:01:19.201 --> 03:01:20.502
FUNDING AND FEDERAL FUNDING

03:01:20.569 --> 03:01:22.571
CANNOT REALLY BE USED FOR SO THE

03:01:22.638 --> 03:01:24.240
THE MONEY THEY WERE TALKING

03:01:24.306 --> 03:01:25.474
ABOUT WILL BE USED?

03:01:25.541 --> 03:01:27.276
TO HIRE PEOPLE TO MANAGE PROVIDE

03:01:27.343 --> 03:01:28.711
MONEY TO HIRE PEOPLE TO MANAGE

03:01:28.777 --> 03:01:31.247
CLEAN UP IN THE SMALL WATER

03:01:31.313 --> 03:01:32.581
COMPANIES.

03:01:32.648 --> 03:01:34.283
THAT COULD BE PART OF IT -- SUBS

03:01:34.350 --> 03:01:38.821
SUBSIDIZED SUBSIDIZE WATER BILLS --

03:01:38.887 --> 03:01:40.623
IF A PART OF THE WATER SYSTEMS

03:01:40.689 --> 03:01:42.691
TO PAY FOR THEIR ONGOING

03:01:42.758 --> 03:01:44.293
OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE I SEE

03:01:44.360 --> 03:01:44.593
[inaudible]

03:01:44.660 --> 03:01:45.828
SO NO [inaudible]

03:01:45.894 --> 03:01:48.964
IF IF IF WE HANDED YOU A CHECK

03:01:49.031 --> 03:01:50.065
FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

03:01:50.132 --> 03:01:51.200
DOLLARS TOMORROW DO WE HAVE A

03:01:51.267 --> 03:01:54.503
LIST OF WATER COMPANIES.

03:01:54.570 --> 03:01:55.871
THAT NEED IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

03:01:55.938 --> 03:01:57.606
AND THE COST FOR EACH OF THOSE

03:01:57.673 --> 03:02:01.610
COMPANIES -- THE WATER BOARD --

03:02:01.677 --> 03:02:03.245
HAVE A LIST OF THOSE WATER

03:02:03.312 --> 03:02:04.546
SYSTEM THEY ARE CURRENTLY NOT

03:02:04.613 --> 03:02:06.248
MEETING DRINKING WATER STANDARDS

03:02:06.315 --> 03:02:07.716
SO THAT WOULD BE KIND OF ONE OF

03:02:07.783 --> 03:02:08.817
THE KIND OF PRIORITIES LOOKING

03:02:08.884 --> 03:02:10.152
AT WHO CURRENTLY IS NOT MEETING

03:02:10.219 --> 03:02:12.087
DRINKING WATER STANDARDS -- BUT

03:02:12.154 --> 03:02:14.089
THERE ARE OTHER SYSTEMS ARE NOT

03:02:14.156 --> 03:02:15.424
REGULATED BY THE WATER BOARD SO

03:02:15.491 --> 03:02:17.359
THERE IS CURRENTLY -- CONFERENCE

03:02:17.426 --> 03:02:19.061
OF ASSESSING BE CONDUCTED BY THE

03:02:19.128 --> 03:02:20.329
WATER BOARD WITH FUNDING THEY'LL

03:02:20.396 --> 03:02:22.164
PROVIDED LAST YEAR THROUGH THE

03:02:22.231 --> 03:02:24.233
BUDGET -- AND THAT ASSESSMENT

03:02:24.300 --> 03:02:26.735
WILL HELP CAN GET TO WHERE ARE

03:02:26.802 --> 03:02:28.604
SOME OF THOSE PRIORITY TO NEED

03:02:28.671 --> 03:02:29.238
AS PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S

03:02:29.305 --> 03:02:31.640
PLAN -- THAT TO BE A A BI ANNUAL

03:02:31.707 --> 03:02:33.842
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT KIND OF

03:02:33.909 --> 03:02:35.544
HIGHLIGHT THOSE PRIORITY AREAS

03:02:35.611 --> 03:02:36.779
AND THAT'S ALWAYS BASED OFF OF A

03:02:36.845 --> 03:02:38.514
BI ANNUAL ASSESSMENT THE WORLD

03:02:38.580 --> 03:02:40.449
WE KIND OF EVALUATING WHAT THE

03:02:40.516 --> 03:02:40.983
NEED IS.

03:02:41.050 --> 03:02:42.584
AT AND HARD BEING THE DOLLARS

03:02:42.651 --> 03:02:45.587
TOWARDS THAT NEED WHEN WAS THAT

03:02:45.654 --> 03:02:47.423
ASSESSMENT -- STUDY BE COMPLETED.

03:02:47.489 --> 03:02:49.024
I THINK IT'S BEING PHASED IN --

03:02:49.091 --> 03:02:50.092
THERE'S MULTIPLE PIECES OF THAT

03:02:50.159 --> 03:02:53.095
STUDY SO -- WE ANTICIPATE WITHIN

03:02:53.162 --> 03:02:54.530
A YEAR AND A HALF WILL COMPLETE

03:02:54.596 --> 03:02:56.498
EVERYTHING THERE ISN'T A DEFINED

03:02:56.565 --> 03:02:57.933
DATA WHEN EACH COMPANY WILL BE

03:02:58.000 --> 03:02:59.335
COMPLETED BUT THERE MIGHT BE

03:02:59.401 --> 03:03:00.636
SOME COMPONENT THAT I BE

03:03:00.703 --> 03:03:01.937
COMPLETED BY THE END OF THIS

03:03:02.004 --> 03:03:02.137
YEAR.

03:03:02.204 --> 03:03:04.239
BUT SENT ITS MULTIPLE COMPONENTS

03:03:04.306 --> 03:03:05.908
OTHERS MIGHT LIKE UNTIL THE

03:03:05.974 --> 03:03:07.876
FOLLOWING YEAR AND DO YOU EXPECT

03:03:07.943 --> 03:03:08.911
WHEN THAT WHEN THAT ASSESSMENT --

03:03:08.977 --> 03:03:10.212
STUDY IS COMPLETED THAT THERE

03:03:10.279 --> 03:03:11.347
WILL BE.

03:03:11.413 --> 03:03:12.815
A BOTTOM LINE HOW MANY WATER

03:03:12.881 --> 03:03:14.483
COMPANIES NEED ATTENTION AND HOW

03:03:14.550 --> 03:03:20.122
MUCH MONEY IS GOING TO BE

03:03:20.189 --> 03:03:21.090
REQUIRED TO FIX THE PROBLEM.

03:03:21.156 --> 03:03:21.990
I THINK IT WOULD DEFINITELY GIVE

03:03:22.057 --> 03:03:22.991
US A LOT OF BETTER SENSE

03:03:23.058 --> 03:03:24.660
CURRENTLY ARE PROPOSAL WAS BASED

03:03:24.727 --> 03:03:26.195
OFF OF PREVIOUS AT THAT FROM

03:03:26.261 --> 03:03:26.695
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE DID

03:03:26.762 --> 03:03:27.730
HIGHLIGHT APPROX ME HUNDRED AND

03:03:27.796 --> 03:03:29.331
FORTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT

03:03:29.398 --> 03:03:30.899
IS THAT'S ALSO HIGHLIGHTED --

03:03:30.966 --> 03:03:32.601
HOW MUCH OF THAT IS THAT

03:03:32.668 --> 03:03:35.204
POTENTIALLY DUE TO POLLUTANTS

03:03:35.270 --> 03:03:37.406
FROM NITRATES WHICH IS GOING ON

WITH THE V. AGRICULTURE CHARGES

03:03:39.508 --> 03:03:41.176
THAT WE HAVE WITHIN OUR PROPOSAL

03:03:41.243 --> 03:03:43.145
AND THEN WHAT CHORE -- POLLUTION

03:03:43.212 --> 03:03:45.114
IS MORE NATURAL CONTAMINATED

03:03:45.180 --> 03:03:46.482
POLLUTION WHICH IS MORE

03:03:46.548 --> 03:03:48.083
CONSISTENT WITH THE THE WATER

03:03:48.150 --> 03:03:49.385
CHARGES ON THE CONSUMERS.

03:03:49.451 --> 03:03:51.253
YOU KNOW WE HAD A LESSON LAST

03:03:51.320 --> 03:03:52.154
YEAR THE YEAR FORGET THE YEAR

03:03:52.221 --> 03:03:55.557
BEFORE ON TRANSPORTATION FUNDING

03:03:55.624 --> 03:03:56.592
AND AND IN THE IN THAT

03:03:56.658 --> 03:03:58.727
PARTICULAR LEGISLATIVE EFFORT

03:03:58.794 --> 03:03:59.862
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION.

03:03:59.928 --> 03:04:02.364
THERE WERE A LIST OF PROJECTS

03:04:02.431 --> 03:04:05.701
AND DOLLAR TOTALS -- WHERE WE

03:04:05.768 --> 03:04:07.536
KNEW AND THE ADMINISTRATION --

03:04:07.603 --> 03:04:09.571
SPECIFICALLY HOW MUCH MONEY WAS

03:04:09.638 --> 03:04:11.807
GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO FIX THIS

03:04:11.874 --> 03:04:14.843
BRIDGE OF THAT ROAD -- EVEN THAT

03:04:14.910 --> 03:04:18.347
WAS DIFFICULT A DIFFICULT SELL.

03:04:18.414 --> 03:04:19.448
TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC IN OUR

03:04:19.515 --> 03:04:22.718
CONSTITUENTS -- WHEN WE MOVE

03:04:22.785 --> 03:04:25.120
AWAY FROM -- GENERAL FUND

03:04:25.187 --> 03:04:26.388
APPROPRIATION WHEN WE MOVE

03:04:26.455 --> 03:04:28.056
TOWARD A FEE OR A TAX OR

03:04:28.123 --> 03:04:30.058
WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT.

03:04:30.125 --> 03:04:31.593
THAT'S WHERE WE REALLY RUN INTO

03:04:31.660 --> 03:04:33.529
TROUBLE BECAUSE AT LEAST DOWN

03:04:33.595 --> 03:04:35.364
WHERE I COME FROM.

03:04:35.431 --> 03:04:36.265
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TAKE

03:04:36.331 --> 03:04:37.433
MONEY.

03:04:37.499 --> 03:04:39.067
AND SEND IT TO SACRAMENTO TO LET

03:04:39.134 --> 03:04:41.303
IT SIT UNTIL WE FIGURE OUT HOW

03:04:41.370 --> 03:04:42.938
MUCH WE NEED AND WHERE IT'S

03:04:43.005 --> 03:04:44.006
GOING TO GO.

03:04:44.072 --> 03:04:45.707
YOU KNOW THEY EXPECT EVEN THE

03:04:45.774 --> 03:04:46.542
ONES THAT ARE WILLING TO

03:04:46.608 --> 03:04:48.877
COOPERATE EVEN THE ONES THAT

03:04:48.944 --> 03:04:50.345
FEEL THE WAY.

03:04:50.412 --> 03:04:51.880
WE DO UP HERE THAT CLEAN

03:04:51.947 --> 03:04:53.849
DRINKING WATER IS A RIGHT AND WE

03:04:53.916 --> 03:04:56.051
NEED TO FIX PROBLEMS WHERE THERE

03:04:56.118 --> 03:04:56.885
IS A LACK OF CLEAN DRINKING

03:04:56.952 --> 03:04:57.553
WATER.

03:04:57.619 --> 03:05:01.056
EVEN PEOPLE WHO SHARE THAT VIEW --

03:05:01.123 --> 03:05:02.958
DON'T LIKE THE CONCEPT OF

03:05:03.025 --> 03:05:04.493
SENDING MONEY TO SACRAMENTO

03:05:04.560 --> 03:05:05.727
WITHOUT A PLAN.

03:05:05.794 --> 03:05:07.296
AND THAT'S WHY I GUESS MY

03:05:07.362 --> 03:05:07.863
QUESTION I THINK WE'RE GONNA

03:05:07.930 --> 03:05:08.831
HAVE.

03:05:08.897 --> 03:05:10.365
TO FIGURE THIS THING OUT EVEN

03:05:10.432 --> 03:05:11.266
WITH THE GENERAL FUND

03:05:11.333 --> 03:05:12.468
APPROPRIATION I THINK WE NEED TO

03:05:12.534 --> 03:05:14.470
FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE

03:05:14.536 --> 03:05:17.372
NEED OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME.

03:05:17.439 --> 03:05:18.040
AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE

03:05:18.106 --> 03:05:19.741
AND UNTIL WE KNOW THAT I DON'T

03:05:19.808 --> 03:05:20.909
KNOW.

03:05:20.976 --> 03:05:22.544
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE HAVE MUCH OF

03:05:22.611 --> 03:05:23.979
A CONVERSATION.

03:05:24.046 --> 03:05:27.216
ABOUT FEES OR TAXES.

03:05:27.282 --> 03:05:28.317
FRANKLY EVEN THE GENERAL FUND

03:05:28.383 --> 03:05:30.552
APPROPRIATION BECAUSE I'M SURE A

03:05:30.619 --> 03:05:31.086
HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

03:05:31.153 --> 03:05:32.087
DOLLARS WHICH IS.

03:05:32.154 --> 03:05:34.156
IN THE SENATE SIDE IS NOT GONNA

03:05:34.223 --> 03:05:35.624
BE ENOUGH TO FIX THIS PROBLEM IS

03:05:35.691 --> 03:05:37.926
IT.

03:05:37.993 --> 03:05:39.027
WELL I WOULD SAY THAT THE

03:05:39.094 --> 03:05:40.863
MESSAGES PROPOSAL IS BASED OFF

03:05:40.929 --> 03:05:42.164
OF AN ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED TWO

03:05:42.231 --> 03:05:44.132
YEARS AGO WE DID ESTIMATE

03:05:44.199 --> 03:05:46.034
APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND

03:05:46.101 --> 03:05:47.803
FORTY MILLION DOLLARS -- NEEDED

03:05:47.870 --> 03:05:50.839
ON GOING ON GOING YES SO THAT

03:05:50.906 --> 03:05:51.940
MITCHELL PROPOSAL IS.

03:05:52.007 --> 03:05:53.408
CONSISTENT WITH THAT ANALYSIS

03:05:53.475 --> 03:05:54.843
HOWEVER WE ARE CONDUCTING

03:05:54.910 --> 03:05:56.512
ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS TO GET KIND

03:05:56.578 --> 03:05:58.313
OF MORE GRANULAR DETAIL AND THAT

03:05:58.380 --> 03:06:00.148
WOULD HELP US IDENTIFY WHAT

03:06:00.215 --> 03:06:00.916
WOULD BE THOSE KIND OF PRIORITY

03:06:00.983 --> 03:06:01.583
AREAS.

03:06:01.650 --> 03:06:02.618
BUT THERE MIGHT BE DIFFERENT

03:06:02.684 --> 03:06:04.653
APPROACHES IN SOME AREAS WE

03:06:04.720 --> 03:06:06.622
MIGHT FOCUS ON CONSOLIDATION IN

03:06:06.688 --> 03:06:08.023
OTHER AREAS WHERE THERE'S NOT A

03:06:08.090 --> 03:06:09.858
CLOSE ENOUGH WATER SYSTEM THAT

03:06:09.925 --> 03:06:10.859
WE CAN CONSOLIDATE.

03:06:10.926 --> 03:06:12.995
THEN WE WOULD BE FOCUSING ON

03:06:13.061 --> 03:06:13.829
SUPPORTING THEIR OPERATIONS AND

03:06:13.896 --> 03:06:15.964
MAINTENANCE AS THOUGH IT'S NOT

03:06:16.031 --> 03:06:16.798
UNTIL YOU GET TO THE GRAND YOUR

03:06:16.865 --> 03:06:18.467
DETAILS AND WHEN YOU WOULD FOCUS

03:06:18.534 --> 03:06:20.769
ON WHAT SPECIFIC STRATEGY TO

03:06:20.836 --> 03:06:23.038
FOCUS ON WHAT SPECIFIC AREA.

03:06:23.105 --> 03:06:25.173
BUT WE DO HAVE AN INITIAL SENSE

03:06:25.240 --> 03:06:25.707
BASED OFF OF THE PREVIOUS

03:06:25.774 --> 03:06:27.709
ESTIMATE OF WHAT IS THOSE THOSE

03:06:27.776 --> 03:06:32.581
NEEDS AND THAT'S WHY ARE

03:06:32.648 --> 03:06:34.182
PROPOSALS BASED OFF.

03:06:34.249 --> 03:06:34.917
WELL YOU I'M YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

03:06:34.983 --> 03:06:35.551
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP BUT YOU CAN

03:06:35.617 --> 03:06:37.185
UNDERSTAND THE CONUNDRUM WE FACE --

03:06:37.252 --> 03:06:38.520
WHEN WE'RE NOT ABLE TO TALK TO

03:06:38.587 --> 03:06:39.755
CONSTITUENTS DIRECTLY AND

03:06:39.821 --> 03:06:41.890
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHERE THIS

03:06:41.957 --> 03:06:43.659
MONEY'S GOING?

03:06:43.725 --> 03:06:45.460
AND HOW MUCH OF IT IS GOING. TO

03:06:45.527 --> 03:06:47.296
A PARTICULAR PLACE IT'S A RATHER

03:06:47.362 --> 03:06:50.365
GENERAL CONCEPT FRANKLY.

03:06:50.432 --> 03:06:51.466
I READ THE MEDIA AND READ THE

03:06:51.533 --> 03:06:53.335
NEWSPAPERS EVEN THE NEWSPAPERS

03:06:53.402 --> 03:06:56.505
ARE CONFUSED -- ABOUT WHETHER IS

03:06:56.572 --> 03:06:58.407
CAPITAL PROJECTS ARE OPERATING

03:06:58.473 --> 03:06:59.641
SUBSIDIES.

03:06:59.708 --> 03:07:00.943
THERE WAS AN ARTICLE I THINK

03:07:01.009 --> 03:07:02.778
THAT WAS -- AN OP ED BY THE

03:07:02.844 --> 03:07:04.346
HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS

03:07:04.413 --> 03:07:06.014
ASSOCIATION FOLKS WAS TALKING

03:07:06.081 --> 03:07:08.050
ABOUT CAPITAL PROJECTS AND BEING

03:07:08.116 --> 03:07:09.918
PLENTY OF BOND MONEY AND WHY DO

03:07:09.985 --> 03:07:11.286
YOU NEED TO HAVE THIS SORT OF

03:07:11.353 --> 03:07:12.721
CONVERSATION WELL.

03:07:12.788 --> 03:07:13.922
BONWIT THERE IS PLENTY OF BOND

03:07:13.989 --> 03:07:16.325
MONEY AND PROJECTS AND NOT THE

03:07:16.391 --> 03:07:18.493
ISSUE HERE SO I THINK THERE'S A

03:07:18.560 --> 03:07:20.028
COMMUNICATION PIECE THERE'S A

03:07:20.095 --> 03:07:21.563
ASSESSMENT PIECE.

03:07:21.630 --> 03:07:22.798
AND THEN OF COURSE WE GET INTO

03:07:22.864 --> 03:07:24.299
THE FEE TAX OR GENERAL FUND

03:07:24.366 --> 03:07:25.767
APPROPRIATION DISCUSSION I JUST

03:07:25.834 --> 03:07:27.469
WANT YOU TO KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO

03:07:27.536 --> 03:07:30.272

THANK YOU MANAGER.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WAS A

03:07:31.940 --> 03:07:33.909
IMPORTANT ROBUST CONVERSATION I

03:07:33.976 --> 03:07:36.445
HEAR THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY.

03:07:36.511 --> 03:07:39.414
ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES -- ON ONE

03:07:39.481 --> 03:07:41.183
ECHO ON THE SCANNERS POINT ABOUT

03:07:41.249 --> 03:07:43.085
IN ANY CONTEXT IN WHICH WE HAVE

03:07:43.151 --> 03:07:45.053
A POLLUTER PAYS KIND OF

03:07:45.120 --> 03:07:47.055
PRINCIPLE -- IT IT SHOULD NOT

03:07:47.122 --> 03:07:48.957
AND CANNOT YOU KNOW INCLUDING

03:07:49.024 --> 03:07:51.627
THE ALLOWANCE FOR THE POTENTIAL

03:07:51.693 --> 03:07:53.395
CONTINUATION OF POLLUTION OR IN

03:07:53.462 --> 03:07:56.665
THE PROPELS IMMUNITY I JUST

03:07:56.732 --> 03:07:58.166
THINK FUNDAMENTALLY THAT'S NOT.

03:07:58.233 --> 03:08:00.235
A HEALTHY APPROPRIATE DIRECTION

03:08:00.302 --> 03:08:01.203
TO GO AND I'M SURE EVERYONE'S

03:08:01.269 --> 03:08:02.971
PERSPECTIVE ABOUT HAVING ACCESS

03:08:03.038 --> 03:08:04.406
TO WATER BE IN A FUNDAMENTAL

03:08:04.473 --> 03:08:06.141
PERSONAL RIGHT -- YOU KNOW I

03:08:06.208 --> 03:08:08.043
THINK IT'S IT'S IRONIC THAT

03:08:08.110 --> 03:08:09.478
PEOPLE ASSUME WATER STREET.

03:08:09.544 --> 03:08:11.546
AND EVEN THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE

03:08:11.613 --> 03:08:12.948
ACCESS TO CLEAN SAFE DRINKING

03:08:13.015 --> 03:08:15.250
WATER ARE PAYING A PREMIUM FOR

03:08:15.317 --> 03:08:15.751
IT.

03:08:15.817 --> 03:08:17.252
A AND SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE

03:08:17.319 --> 03:08:18.820
THAT'S EVEN MORE OFFENSIVE FOR

03:08:18.887 --> 03:08:20.288
LOOK FOR TO THIS CONVERSATION I

03:08:20.355 --> 03:08:21.723
AGREE WITH YOU DOCTOR WET WEBER.

IN OUR STATE BUDGET IS A

03:08:23.659 --> 03:08:24.926
REFLECTION OF OUR VALUES AS OF A

03:08:24.993 --> 03:08:30.666
LEGISLATIVE BODY AND SO THIS IS

03:08:30.732 --> 03:08:31.967
THE PLACE.

03:08:32.034 --> 03:08:33.902
TO SOLVE THIS PROB PROBLEM.

03:08:33.969 --> 03:08:34.936
ALBEIT TEMPORARY -- BUT IT'S

03:08:35.003 --> 03:08:35.604
IMPORTANT PLACE FOR US TO

03:08:35.671 --> 03:08:36.538
