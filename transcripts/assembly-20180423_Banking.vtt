OF EQUIPMENT OTHER TO I

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.290 region:rollup2
PROVISIONS OF THE BILL WE THINK

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:34.925 region:rollup2
ARE MOST IMPORTANT IS SETTING

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:36.326 region:rollup2
RIGHT THE ORDER BY WHICH YOU

01:01:34.925 --> 01:01:37.694 region:rollup2
WOULD DO ABILITY TO PAY WE'RE

01:01:36.326 --> 01:01:39.629 region:rollup2
VERY STRONG PROPONENTS OF MAKING

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:41.231 region:rollup2
SURE THE UNDERWRITING. IS DONE A

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:42.666 region:rollup2
COMPLETE IN THE ABILITY TO PAY

01:01:41.231 --> 01:01:45.035 region:rollup2
IS VERIFIED PRIOR TO WORK

01:01:42.666 --> 01:01:46.503 region:rollup2
STARTING UNDER CURRENT LAW YOU

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:47.604 region:rollup2
COULD BE INTO A CONTRACTOR FOR A

01:01:46.503 --> 01:01:48.438 region:rollup2
COUPLE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THEN

01:01:47.604 --> 01:01:50.006 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT THAT YOU CAN'T

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:50.674 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY AFFORD IT AND YOU'RE

01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:52.375 region:rollup2
STILL GOING ON THE HOOK FOR THAT

01:01:50.674 --> 01:01:54.211 region:rollup2
MONEY. SO WE FEEL THAT THAT THAT

01:01:52.375 --> 01:01:54.678 region:rollup2
CHANGE IN THIS BILL IS REALLY

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:55.812 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR CONSUMER

01:01:54.678 --> 01:01:57.681 region:rollup2
PROTECTION.

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:59.783 region:rollup2
HIGHS PIECE ASSESSMENTS ARE NOT

01:01:57.681 --> 01:02:00.383 region:rollup2
MORTGAGES BUT THEY LOOK A LOT

01:01:59.783 --> 01:02:02.652 region:rollup2
LIKE A MORTGAGE AND NOT THEY

01:02:00.383 --> 01:02:04.254 region:rollup2
SURVIVE THEY AYE IF YOU DON'T

01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:05.155 region:rollup2
PAY IT YOU CAN LOSE YOUR HOME.

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:06.323 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY AFTER FIVE YEARS OR

01:02:05.155 --> 01:02:08.191 region:rollup2
TEN YEARS THE PANEL HOW THE

01:02:06.323 --> 01:02:09.726 region:rollup2
COUNTY HANDLES IT CONCILIAR LOSE

01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:11.061 region:rollup2
YOUR HOME BUT ACTUALLY A UNLIKE

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:13.163 region:rollup2
MORTGAGES THAT ACTUALLY SURVIVES

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:13.964 region:rollup2
BANKRUPTCY AND TAX SALE SO IF

01:02:13.163 --> 01:02:15.999 region:rollup2
THE HOME HAD A PIECE ASSESSMENT

01:02:13.964 --> 01:02:17.300 region:rollup2
ON IT. AND IT WENT TO TAX BILL

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:18.134 region:rollup2
WHOEVER BUYS IT IS STILL GONNA

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.202 region:rollup2
PICK UP THE REST OF THAT PIECE

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:20.837 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT SO IT IS A VERY

01:02:19.202 --> 01:02:21.571 region:rollup2
STRONG LEAN. AND WE THINK THE

01:02:20.837 --> 01:02:23.340 region:rollup2
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS ARE

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:24.274 region:rollup2
CRITICAL IN THIS AREA THE SECOND

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.775 region:rollup2
PART OF THE BILL THAT WE THINK

01:02:24.274 --> 01:02:27.177 region:rollup2
IS VERY IMPORTANT IS THE

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:28.311 region:rollup2
INSURANCE PIECE. UP CINEMA

01:02:27.177 --> 01:02:29.613 region:rollup2

IN THE FIRES IN THE NORTH BAY.

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:33.917 region:rollup2
AND AT THAT HAD PIECE OF

01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:34.751 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCE ON THEM WE DON'T KNOW

01:02:33.917 --> 01:02:36.386 region:rollup2
HOW FAR INTO THEIR PACE

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:37.287 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT TIME WHEN THEY WORK.

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:39.256 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ARE STILL ON THE HOOK

01:02:37.287 --> 01:02:40.624 region:rollup2
FOR THAT PROPERTY IMPROVEMENT

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:43.093 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF WHETHER NOT EXIST

01:02:40.624 --> 01:02:44.327 region:rollup2
ANYMORE AND WE WE KEEP HEARING

01:02:43.093 --> 01:02:45.595 region:rollup2
THAT THE HOMEOWNERS OR UNDER

THE BILL IS SPECIFICALLY THIS

01:05:57.921 --> 01:06:01.424 region:rollup2
BILL WOULD MOVE THE TIMING OF

AND IF AB TWENTY SIXTY THREE

01:06:02.892 --> 01:06:06.129 region:rollup2

01:06:04.594 --> 01:06:06.763 region:rollup2
MOVE IT UP PRIOR TO THE

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:12.068 region:rollup2
THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY A TECHNICAL

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:13.570 region:rollup2
CHANGE WHEN IT COMES TO PACE IT

01:06:12.068 --> 01:06:15.138 region:rollup2
WOULD TREAT PACE AS A MORTGAGE

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:17.073 region:rollup2

FROM PACE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS

01:06:33.923 --> 01:06:36.326 region:rollup2
TO THEIR HOME.

01:06:35.191 --> 01:06:37.293 region:rollup2
CANCELING PASTE IS NOT

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:38.895 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE

01:06:37.293 --> 01:06:40.497 region:rollup2
HOMEOWNER NEEDS TO CANCEL THEIR

01:06:38.895 --> 01:06:41.664 region:rollup2
HOME IMPROVEMENT CONTRACT AT THE

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:42.899 region:rollup2

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:44.133 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED INDEPENDENTLY OF ONE

01:06:42.899 --> 01:06:45.935 region:rollup2
ANOTHER.

01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:46.936 region:rollup2
FURTHER WHILE THE PROPONENTS OF

01:06:45.935 --> 01:06:47.737 region:rollup2

01:06:58.548 --> 01:07:02.218 region:rollup2
VERIFICATION PROCESS OF THAT

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:03.887 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO PAY TAKES PLACE

01:07:02.218 --> 01:07:05.522 region:rollup2
DURING UNDERWRITING IF THERE'S A

01:07:03.887 --> 01:07:07.590 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT TOP

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:09.359 region:rollup2
LEVEL ANALYSIS AND THE ACTUAL

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:11.261 region:rollup2
VERIFICATION THAT VERIFIED

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:13.296 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF AN ABILITY TO REPAY.

01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:13.796 region:rollup2
UNDER AB TWELVE EIGHTY FOUR WE

01:07:13.296 --> 01:07:14.731 region:rollup2
ARE ON THE HOOK FOR THE

01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:16.366 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE.

01:07:14.731 --> 01:07:18.034 region:rollup2
SO THE LAW THAT YOU HELPED WRITE

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:19.569 region:rollup2

OF RENOVATE AMERICA. RELATE

01:07:40.456 --> 01:07:42.992 region:rollup2
AMERICA'S A SAN DIEGO BASED

01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:44.594 region:rollup2
COMPANY THEY'RE THE LARGEST

01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:45.895 region:rollup2
PROVIDER OF PACE FINANCING MAY

01:07:44.594 --> 01:07:48.331 region:rollup2
WORK WITH OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:49.666 region:rollup2
FORTY LOCAL GOVERNMENT CITIES

01:07:48.331 --> 01:07:51.167 region:rollup2
AND COUNTIES AROUND THE STATE.

01:07:49.666 --> 01:07:53.102 region:rollup2
I AM I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:54.737 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE WHY PACE EXISTS IN THE

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:56.472 region:rollup2
FIRST PLACE WHICH IS THAT. I'M

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:57.774 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RECOGNIZED

01:07:56.472 --> 01:07:59.342 region:rollup2
THAT MORE THAN SEVENTY PERCENT

01:07:57.774 --> 01:08:00.910 region:rollup2
OF THE HOMES IN CALIFORNIA WERE

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:02.278 region:rollup2
BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN EIGHTY AND

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:03.980 region:rollup2
ARE TERRIBLY INEFFICIENT AND

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:06.115 region:rollup2
THAT MEANS WE'RE RUNNING ENTIRE

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:08.117 region:rollup2
POWER PLANTS. SIMPLY TO HEAT AND

01:08:06.115 --> 01:08:09.252 region:rollup2
COOL THE OUTSIDE SO THEY CHOSE

01:08:08.117 --> 01:08:11.054 region:rollup2
TO USE THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:08:09.252 --> 01:08:12.121 region:rollup2
BONDING AUTHORITY TO HELP PEOPLE

01:08:11.054 --> 01:08:14.357 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO

01:08:12.121 --> 01:08:16.926 region:rollup2
THEIR HOME MAKE THE ENERGY AND

01:08:14.357 --> 01:08:18.761 region:rollup2

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:20.396 region:rollup2
YOU HEARD SOME OF THE STATISTICS

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:22.632 region:rollup2
I'M I'LL JUST TO ADD TO THOSE.

01:08:20.396 --> 01:08:24.867 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF CO TWO THAT WE'VE

01:08:22.632 --> 01:08:26.736 region:rollup2
SAVED ANNUALLY IS THE EQUIVALENT

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:28.605 region:rollup2
OF OVER FIVE MILLION ACRES OF

PLACE.

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:53.609 region:rollup2
BUT THE.

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:56.145 region:rollup2
THE LAW HAS TO TELL YOU. THAT

01:11:53.609 --> 01:11:57.780 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO ASSESS THE ABILITY.

01:11:56.145 --> 01:11:59.682 region:rollup2

BEFORE THE ASSESSMENT IS

THAT ABILITY TO PAY

01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:01.430 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION BEING COMPLETED

01:14:59.028 --> 01:15:03.833 region:rollup2
BUT THAT THE B. FRANKA.

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:06.202 region:rollup2
CONTRACTOR YOU WOULD BE MORE

01:15:03.833 --> 01:15:08.437 region:rollup2
ANXIOUS TO SELL THAT TO PRODUCT

SO YOU'LL BE IMPOSING ON ME OR

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:19.382 region:rollup2
HAD THIS OKAY BYE BYE. IN THE

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:21.617 region:rollup2
LATER I FIND OUT AND THAT AND

01:15:19.382 --> 01:15:23.352 region:rollup2
THAT IS ALSO WHAT THE ORPHALI

01:15:21.617 --> 01:15:25.521 region:rollup2
SAID TRYING TO REVERSE A MAKE

01:15:23.352 --> 01:15:27.823 region:rollup2
SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND I HAVE

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:29.558 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO PAY WHAT EXTRA

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:31.127 region:rollup2
AMOUNT TO OUR HAVE TO PAY ALONG

01:15:29.558 --> 01:15:32.228 region:rollup2
WITH THE TAX.

01:15:31.127 --> 01:15:33.095 region:rollup2
RIGHT I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND I

01:15:32.228 --> 01:15:35.431 region:rollup2
THINK YOU KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:37.366 region:rollup2
COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH US

01:15:35.431 --> 01:15:38.434 region:rollup2
AROUND THE LANGUAGE I'M AROUND

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:39.502 region:rollup2
UNDERWRITING AND SO WE LOOK

01:15:38.434 --> 01:15:41.704 region:rollup2
FORWARD TO DOING THAT WITH HER

01:15:39.502 --> 01:15:43.172 region:rollup2
GOING FORWARD.

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:44.507 region:rollup2
YEAH I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT I

01:15:43.172 --> 01:15:46.909 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THAT THE CONTRACTOR.

01:15:44.507 --> 01:15:48.210 region:rollup2
IS NOT THE ONE WHO HAS A

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:49.678 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO DETERMINE

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:51.414 region:rollup2
WHETHER THE HOMEOWNER HAS THE

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:51.881 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO PAY THE ASSESSMENT

01:15:51.414 --> 01:15:53.682 region:rollup2
THAT'S ON THE PROGRAM

01:15:51.881 --> 01:15:55.484 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATORS. AT SO THAT'S

01:15:53.682 --> 01:15:57.286 region:rollup2
ANYTHING NOTHING CAN BE EXECUTED

01:15:55.484 --> 01:15:58.988 region:rollup2
ON OUR END UNTIL THEY GO THROUGH

01:15:57.286 --> 01:16:00.790 region:rollup2
THAT VERIFICATION PROCESS AND

01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:01.857 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:04.060 region:rollup2
THAT WE LAID OUT THE CONFIRM

01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:06.095 region:rollup2
TERMS CALLS. BECAUSE WE HAVE A

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:07.997 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT

01:16:06.095 --> 01:16:09.165 region:rollup2
THAT HOMEOWNER CAN PAY SO THAT'S

01:16:07.997 --> 01:16:11.567 region:rollup2
WHY I'M WONDERING.

01:16:09.165 --> 01:16:13.436 region:rollup2
IF AUTHOR WHAT THE SPECIFIC A

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:14.003 region:rollup2
WAYS SO YOU AND I MAKE SURE THAT

01:16:13.436 --> 01:16:15.905 region:rollup2
I WOULD HAVE LET BILLY TO TO

01:16:14.003 --> 01:16:19.508 region:rollup2
PAY.

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:21.577 region:rollup2
THE FULL I SIGNED UP MY COUNTRY.

01:16:19.508 --> 01:16:23.312 region:rollup2
MADAM CHAIR MAY I ADD THAT THE

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:25.147 region:rollup2
DEL IS. TOTALLY FOR IT.

01:16:23.312 --> 01:16:26.816 region:rollup2
IS INSTITUTED SOME ABILITY TO

01:16:25.147 --> 01:16:28.317 region:rollup2
PAY THE TERMINATION THAT. WHICH

01:16:26.816 --> 01:16:30.219 region:rollup2
I THINK IS VERY SIMILAR TO A

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:32.288 region:rollup2
MORTGAGE EVEN THOUGH AT THIS

01:16:30.219 --> 01:16:34.256 region:rollup2
MORTGAGE. IT'S AND I THINK THERE

01:16:32.288 --> 01:16:35.691 region:rollup2
ISN'T TIME TO. A VERIFY THAT

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:37.593 region:rollup2
THEY CAN PAY THE PROBLEM THAT

01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:39.295 region:rollup2
OBJECTION THAT THE OPPOSITION

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:40.863 region:rollup2
HAS RIGHT NOW IS THAT THEY WANT.

01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:42.631 region:rollup2
THEY ARE THE CONTRACTORS THEY

01:16:40.863 --> 01:16:43.466 region:rollup2
WANT TO CONTINUE TO ALLOW THE

01:16:42.631 --> 01:16:47.937 region:rollup2
CONTRACTORS TO BEGIN WORK ON THE

01:16:43.466 --> 01:16:49.238 region:rollup2
HOME. BEFORE THE FULL ABILITY TO

01:16:47.937 --> 01:16:50.539 region:rollup2
DETERMINE TO OF ABILITY TO REPAY

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:52.575 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN TURMAN SO WHAT COULD

01:16:50.539 --> 01:16:54.243 region:rollup2
HAPPEN TO THE HOMEOWNER. IS THAT

01:16:52.575 --> 01:16:55.878 region:rollup2
THEY MAY ABANDONED PAYS

01:16:54.243 --> 01:16:57.880 region:rollup2
FINANCING BUT THEIR SLOGAN BE ON

01:16:55.878 --> 01:16:59.281 region:rollup2
THE HOOK FOR WHATEVER WORK. GETS

01:16:57.880 --> 01:17:01.984 region:rollup2
DONE ON THE HOUSE

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:03.052 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT IS THE CONCERN THAT.

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:04.253 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT TWENTY

01:17:03.052 --> 01:17:05.588 region:rollup2
SIXTY THREE IF IT'S PARTLY

01:17:04.253 --> 01:17:06.655 region:rollup2
COUNTRY DOES ADDRESS IS MAKE

01:17:05.588 --> 01:17:07.990 region:rollup2
SURE THAT.

01:17:06.655 --> 01:17:08.958 region:rollup2
IT GOES IN ORDER BECAUSE IT

01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:10.359 region:rollup2
SHOULDN'T BE TREATED LIKE IT'S

01:17:08.958 --> 01:17:11.794 region:rollup2
AN IMPULSE BUY THE REGISTER THIS

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:12.728 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THAT SECURED BY OUR

01:17:11.794 --> 01:17:15.431 region:rollup2
HOME AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:16.065 region:rollup2
THAT. ON IT YOU DON'T HAVE YOU

01:17:15.431 --> 01:17:16.999 region:rollup2
CAN BE QUICK BUT YOU DON'T HAVE

01:17:16.065 --> 01:17:19.335 region:rollup2
TO HURRY.

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:22.404 region:rollup2
WHEN HIS BILL IS ADOPTED A CAN I

01:17:19.335 --> 01:17:24.340 region:rollup2
CALL AFTER THEN YOU MISS.

01:17:22.404 --> 01:17:27.343 region:rollup2
JUDGE THE MY ABILITY TO TO PAY

01:17:24.340 --> 01:17:28.644 region:rollup2
WHEN I GO ALL BANKRUPT.

01:17:27.343 --> 01:17:30.079 region:rollup2
SO LET ME I I'LL ACTUALLY TO SAY

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:31.547 region:rollup2
IF YOU WILL NEVER HAVE THE PACE

01:17:30.079 --> 01:17:33.649 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT RECORDED AGAINST YOUR

01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:35.718 region:rollup2
YOUR ABILITY TO PAY AND THAT'S

01:17:35.217 --> 01:17:37.620 region:rollup2
WHAT WE THAT'S WHAT WE.

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:39.421 region:rollup2
I.

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:41.123 region:rollup2
PROHIBITED WHAT WORK I THINK THE

01:17:39.421 --> 01:17:41.290 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING HERE.

01:17:41.123 --> 01:17:42.892 region:rollup2
IS.

01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:44.059 region:rollup2
.

01:17:42.892 --> 01:17:44.627 region:rollup2
BEING OBLIGATED TO THE

01:17:44.059 --> 01:17:46.462 region:rollup2
UNDERLYING HOME IMPROVEMENT

01:17:44.627 --> 01:17:48.631 region:rollup2
CONTRACT.

01:17:46.462 --> 01:17:49.999 region:rollup2
AND THE WAY THAT THE BILLS THAT

01:17:48.631 --> 01:17:52.034 region:rollup2
WE PASSED LAST YEAR.

01:17:49.999 --> 01:17:54.436 region:rollup2
DICTATE THAT THE PACE

01:17:52.034 --> 01:17:57.172 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATOR IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:17:54.436 --> 01:17:58.741 region:rollup2
ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

01:17:57.172 --> 01:18:01.110 region:rollup2
CONCLUSION OF AN ABILITY TO PAY

01:17:58.741 --> 01:18:01.710 region:rollup2
DETERMINATION. AND WHAT WAS

01:18:01.110 --> 01:18:04.146 region:rollup2
ORIGINALLY.

01:18:01.710 --> 01:18:05.814 region:rollup2
CONCLUDED SO WE DO THE ABILITY

01:18:04.146 --> 01:18:07.116 region:rollup2
TO PAY DETERMINATION AND THEN WE

01:18:05.814 --> 01:18:07.883 region:rollup2
HAVE TO GO BACK AND VERIFY THOSE

01:18:07.116 --> 01:18:09.518 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTS SO IF YOU'RE MY

01:18:07.883 --> 01:18:11.053 region:rollup2

HOW WE MAKE OUR INITIAL INITIAL

01:18:15.558 --> 01:18:18.494 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO PAY AND DETERMINATION

01:18:17.626 --> 01:18:20.329 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE TO GO BACK BY

01:18:18.494 --> 01:18:21.597 region:rollup2
STATUTE AND VERIFY ALL OF THOSE

01:18:20.329 --> 01:18:22.965 region:rollup2
THINGS.

01:18:21.597 --> 01:18:24.266 region:rollup2
SO I'M THERE WILL NEVER BE A

01:18:22.965 --> 01:18:25.768 region:rollup2
SITUATION WHICH A HOMEOWNERS ON

01:18:24.266 --> 01:18:27.369 region:rollup2

THE DETERMINATION OF THE

01:26:05.494 --> 01:26:09.097 region:rollup2
WAS PASSED IN THE FIFTIES.

01:26:07.496 --> 01:26:10.766 region:rollup2
AND IT'S ANTIQUATED AND IT DOES

01:26:09.097 --> 01:26:11.833 region:rollup2
NOT RESPECT WHAT WE DO AS AN

01:26:10.766 --> 01:26:13.235 region:rollup2
ONLINE THE GENERATOR DOESN'T

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:14.870 region:rollup2
RESPECT.

01:26:13.235 --> 01:26:16.905 region:rollup2
TECHNOLOGY TODAY THAT IS HELPING

01:26:14.870 --> 01:26:18.507 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS FIND APPROPRIATE

01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:19.074 region:rollup2
LENDERS BUT JUST WANT TO TOUCH

01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:20.275 region:rollup2
ON A COUPLE OF THOSE THINGS

01:26:19.074 --> 01:26:22.844 region:rollup2
BECAUSE.

01:26:20.275 --> 01:26:23.979 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO HAS TO BE RESPECTED

01:26:22.844 --> 01:26:25.313 region:rollup2
AND WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE

01:26:23.979 --> 01:26:27.516 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS WORSE FOR CONSUMERS

01:26:25.313 --> 01:26:29.284 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA?

01:26:27.516 --> 01:26:30.686 region:rollup2
A GOOD LEAD GENERATORS.

01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:32.554 region:rollup2
THAT THEIR LENDERS VERY

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:34.222 region:rollup2
CAREFULLY GOODLY GENERATORS AND

01:26:32.554 --> 01:26:37.192 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT OVER

01:26:34.222 --> 01:26:38.894 region:rollup2
PROMISING AND UNDER DELIVERING.

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:40.328 region:rollup2
GOODLY GENERATORS WILL NOT TELL

01:26:38.894 --> 01:26:41.797 region:rollup2

LOAN THE LOAN THAT'S RIGHT FOR

01:26:43.765 --> 01:26:48.837 region:rollup2
YOU. BECAUSE LEAD GENERATION IS

01:26:46.334 --> 01:26:50.806 region:rollup2
IS REALLY A CONSUMER AGNOSTIC

01:26:48.837 --> 01:26:53.041 region:rollup2
ACTIVITY.

01:26:50.806 --> 01:26:54.376 region:rollup2
THIS IS PART OF THE FUNDAMENTAL

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:56.111 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT WE HAVE WITH THE

01:26:54.376 --> 01:26:57.446 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION AS DRAFTED. IT

01:26:56.111 --> 01:26:59.214 region:rollup2
CONFLATES LEAD GENERATION AND

01:26:57.446 --> 01:27:01.116 region:rollup2
BROKERING.

01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:02.050 region:rollup2
BROKERING AS EVERYBODY KNOWS OF

01:27:01.116 --> 01:27:03.385 region:rollup2
THAT DEALT WITH THE MORTGAGE

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:05.120 region:rollup2
BROKER OR ANY OTHER TYPE OF

01:27:03.385 --> 01:27:07.456 region:rollup2
BROKER BROKERING INVOLVES

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:08.657 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES. THAT ARE DEEPER THAN

01:27:07.456 --> 01:27:09.958 region:rollup2
JUST BRINGING TWO PARTIES

01:27:08.657 --> 01:27:11.993 region:rollup2
TOGETHER

01:27:09.958 --> 01:27:13.895 region:rollup2
BROKERS WILL FIGHT FOR YOU OR

01:27:11.993 --> 01:27:15.897 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD BROKERS WILL SAY LET

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:17.699 region:rollup2
ME FIND THE LOAN THAT IS RIGHT

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:18.700 region:rollup2
FOR YOU LET ME SHOP AROUND AND

01:27:17.699 --> 01:27:20.402 region:rollup2
GET THE BEST RATES AND THE BEST

01:27:18.700 --> 01:27:22.471 region:rollup2
TERMS.

01:27:20.402 --> 01:27:24.706 region:rollup2
LET ME COLLECT DOCUMENTS VERIFY

01:27:22.471 --> 01:27:26.374 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING GET YOUR SIGNATURES

01:27:24.706 --> 01:27:28.677 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITIES THAT

01:27:26.374 --> 01:27:30.512 region:rollup2
A BROKER WILL DO. THAT A LEAD

01:27:28.677 --> 01:27:32.447 region:rollup2
GENERATOR DOESN'T DO.

01:27:30.512 --> 01:27:33.949 region:rollup2
SO JUST TWEAKING THE DEFINITION

01:27:32.447 --> 01:27:36.118 region:rollup2
OF BROKER.

01:27:33.949 --> 01:27:37.919 region:rollup2
TO ENCOMPASS LEAD GENERATORS

01:27:36.118 --> 01:27:39.688 region:rollup2
DOES NOT RESPECTED THE IMPORTANT

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:42.124 region:rollup2
ROLE THAT WE PLAY.

01:27:39.688 --> 01:27:43.291 region:rollup2
BADLY GENERATORS ARE OUT THERE.

01:27:42.124 --> 01:27:45.160 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:47.562 region:rollup2
AND I HAVE PAGE AFTER PAGE AFTER

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:49.498 region:rollup2
PAGE OF EXAMPLES OF WHAT BADLY

01:27:47.562 --> 01:27:50.665 region:rollup2
GENERATORS DO AND THE HARM THAT

01:27:49.498 --> 01:27:52.234 region:rollup2
THEY BRING TO CALIFORNIA

01:27:50.665 --> 01:27:53.702 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS.

01:27:52.234 --> 01:27:55.137 region:rollup2
SO LET ME SEE MONEY STEP BACK

01:27:53.702 --> 01:27:56.605 region:rollup2
AND AND TO STATE SOMETHING

01:27:55.137 --> 01:27:58.340 region:rollup2
THAT'S PROBABLY OBVIOUS.

01:27:56.605 --> 01:28:00.642 region:rollup2
CONSUMERS START THEIR SEARCH

01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:01.510 region:rollup2
MORE OFTEN THAN NOT ONLINE WHEN

01:28:00.642 --> 01:28:03.612 region:rollup2
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR A FINANCIAL

01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:05.814 region:rollup2
SOLUTION.

01:28:03.612 --> 01:28:08.450 region:rollup2
AND CONSUMERS WANT. AN IMMEDIATE

01:28:05.814 --> 01:28:09.684 region:rollup2
ANSWER TO THEIR FINANCIAL NEEDS

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:11.386 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY ONLINE LEAD

01:28:09.684 --> 01:28:13.155 region:rollup2
GENERATION EXIST AND THAT'S ALSO

01:28:11.386 --> 01:28:15.690 region:rollup2
WHY IT'S DANGEROUS.

01:28:13.155 --> 01:28:17.793 region:rollup2
SO YOU CAN EITHER HAPPEN UPON A

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:19.461 region:rollup2
GOODLY GENERATOR WHO'S NOT GOING

01:28:17.793 --> 01:28:21.429 region:rollup2

01:28:19.461 --> 01:28:23.031 region:rollup2
YOU WHO'S GOING TO MAKE SURE

01:28:21.429 --> 01:28:25.934 region:rollup2
THAT THEY KEEP THEIR PROMISES TO

YOU. PROTECT YOUR DATA LIKE IT

01:28:25.934 --> 01:28:29.604 region:rollup2

WORK WITH LENDERS THEY HAVE

01:28:29.604 --> 01:28:32.474 region:rollup2
ADDED THOSE OF THE GOOD GUYS.

01:28:31.039 --> 01:28:34.242 region:rollup2
THE BAD GUYS ARE OUT THERE AND

01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:35.277 region:rollup2

WANT ANYONE SO FAR FOR THEIR

01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:59.301 region:rollup2

01:29:04.105 --> 01:29:06.741 region:rollup2
TO REBUILD MY CREDIT I NEED

01:29:06.074 --> 01:29:09.578 region:rollup2
THESE TYPES OF THINGS GO ON AND

01:29:06.741 --> 01:29:10.178 region:rollup2
ON AND ON. SO MY POINT IS

01:29:09.578 --> 01:29:13.682 region:rollup2
WITH SOME GOES ONLINE LOOKING

SHORT TERM EMERGENCY CREDIT.

01:29:15.717 --> 01:29:19.287 region:rollup2
WE HOPE THEY FIND SOMEONE LIKE

01:29:17.419 --> 01:29:20.855 region:rollup2
US WHO IS VERY CONSCIENTIOUS OF

01:29:19.287 --> 01:29:22.891 region:rollup2

OR THEY CAN FIND THE BAD GUYS.

01:29:30.999 --> 01:29:35.337 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS

01:29:33.134 --> 01:29:36.137 region:rollup2
TAKE A STEP BACK AND SAY WHAT IS

01:29:35.337 --> 01:29:38.039 region:rollup2

WHY YOU ARE A POOR SEEN?

01:34:43.011 --> 01:34:47.048 region:rollup2
IN A TOOL THAT THE ASPECT THAT

01:34:44.946 --> 01:34:48.216 region:rollup2
BILL WOULD FACE A.

ASSEMBLYMEMBER IMANI SO TRY TO

CAN ANSWER IT AND THEN I HAVE

01:34:52.620 --> 01:34:55.490 region:rollup2
SOME FUND WHAT QUESTIONS

SURE I'D BE HAPPY TO THANK YOU

01:34:55.490 --> 01:34:57.725 region:rollup2
DOCTOR CHOI.

01:34:55.823 --> 01:34:59.661 region:rollup2
DO WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THE

01:34:57.725 --> 01:35:01.529 region:rollup2
CONCEPT OF REGULATION OR

01:34:59.661 --> 01:35:03.698 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

01:35:01.529 --> 01:35:05.199 region:rollup2
OUR LICENSE IN CALIFORNIA ONE OF

01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:07.835 region:rollup2
VERY FEW LEE GENERATORS THAT

01:35:05.199 --> 01:35:09.003 region:rollup2
DOES HOLD THOSE LICENSES.

01:35:07.835 --> 01:35:10.338 region:rollup2
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE

01:35:09.003 --> 01:35:11.773 region:rollup2
ARE CLEAR ON THE DISTINCTION

01:35:10.338 --> 01:35:12.240 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS YOU KNOW IT WILL

01:35:11.773 --> 01:35:14.008 region:rollup2
LENDING TREE IS A LEAD

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:16.010 region:rollup2
GENERATOR.

01:35:14.008 --> 01:35:17.946 region:rollup2
IT OPERATES DIFFERENTLY THAN THE

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:19.080 region:rollup2
WAY WE OPERATE.

01:35:17.946 --> 01:35:20.682 region:rollup2
BUT CONSUMERS DO NEED TO

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:21.849 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE DISTINCTION THEY

01:35:20.682 --> 01:35:24.185 region:rollup2
NEED TO KNOW IF THEY'RE WORKING

01:35:21.849 --> 01:35:26.054 region:rollup2
WITH THE. THAT BROKER IS

01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:26.654 region:rollup2
ADVOCATING FOR THEM

01:35:26.054 --> 01:35:28.089 region:rollup2
IF THEY'RE WORKING WITH A LEAD

01:35:26.654 --> 01:35:29.857 region:rollup2
GENERATOR.

01:35:28.089 --> 01:35:31.226 region:rollup2
THIS IS A MARKETPLACE WHERE YOU

01:35:29.857 --> 01:35:33.261 region:rollup2
MAY OR MAY NOT BE CONNECTED WITH

01:35:31.226 --> 01:35:34.629 region:rollup2
THE LENDER THAT YOU WANT.

01:35:33.261 --> 01:35:36.431 region:rollup2
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN HOW LEE

01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:37.966 region:rollup2
GENERATORS AND BROKERS ARE

01:35:36.431 --> 01:35:38.566 region:rollup2
TRADITIONALLY COMPENSATED.

01:35:37.966 --> 01:35:40.201 region:rollup2
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN THE

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:42.637 region:rollup2
TYPES OF DISCLOSURES THAT THEY

01:35:40.201 --> 01:35:43.705 region:rollup2
MAKE SO OUR OPPOSITION IS NOT TO

01:35:42.637 --> 01:35:45.506 region:rollup2
THE CONCEPT OF CONSUMER

01:35:43.705 --> 01:35:48.276 region:rollup2
PROTECTION WE BELIEVE THAT THAT

01:35:45.506 --> 01:35:49.577 region:rollup2
IS NECESSARY. OUR OPPOSITION IS

01:35:48.276 --> 01:35:51.446 region:rollup2
JUST TO SAY RESPECT THE

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:53.348 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES AND LET'S MAKE SURE.

01:35:51.446 --> 01:35:55.316 region:rollup2
WE DON'T.

01:35:53.348 --> 01:35:56.317 region:rollup2
MAKE THE DEFINITIONAL PROBLEMS

01:35:55.316 --> 01:35:57.852 region:rollup2
WITH THE BROKER LANGUAGE NOW

01:35:56.317 --> 01:35:59.220 region:rollup2
WORSE

01:35:57.852 --> 01:36:00.688 region:rollup2
LET'S JUST SPLIT THE TWO AND

01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:01.923 region:rollup2
SAID THIS IS WHAT WE GENERATIONS

01:36:00.688 --> 01:36:04.158 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHAT BROKERING AS. THERE

01:36:01.923 --> 01:36:05.693 region:rollup2
ARE DIFFERENT.

01:36:04.158 --> 01:36:07.362 region:rollup2
THE OBLIGATIONS AND THERE ARE

01:36:05.693 --> 01:36:09.197 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DISCLOSURES THAT WOULD

01:36:07.362 --> 01:36:11.833 region:rollup2
BE NECESSARY THEY'RE SENIOR

01:36:09.197 --> 01:36:13.401 region:rollup2
DISTRICT TRYING TO.

01:36:11.833 --> 01:36:15.336 region:rollup2
ANDY GENERATORS.

01:36:13.401 --> 01:36:16.938 region:rollup2
TO BE LICENSED AND. BROKERS

01:36:15.336 --> 01:36:18.906 region:rollup2
CORRECT.

01:36:16.938 --> 01:36:19.474 region:rollup2
OKAY SO THAT.

01:36:18.906 --> 01:36:21.943 region:rollup2
WOULD PROTECT THE CONSUMERS

01:36:19.474 --> 01:36:23.645 region:rollup2
MORE.

01:36:21.943 --> 01:36:25.680 region:rollup2
IT IT ONLY PROTECTS CONSUMERS

01:36:23.645 --> 01:36:27.882 region:rollup2
MORE IF THE LEAD GENERATION

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:28.950 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA SAYS YES

01:36:27.882 --> 01:36:30.752 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTAND WE NEED TO BE

01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:31.953 region:rollup2
LICENSED AND WERE WILLING TO DO

01:36:30.752 --> 01:36:33.521 region:rollup2
IT. BECAUSE IF THE LEAD

01:36:31.953 --> 01:36:35.289 region:rollup2
GENERATORS PULL OUT THEY IF THEY

01:36:33.521 --> 01:36:36.024 region:rollup2
SAY WE'RE NOT BROKERS.

01:36:35.289 --> 01:36:37.859 region:rollup2
AND THEY EITHER DON'T

01:36:36.024 --> 01:36:39.794 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE OR THE EXIT THE

01:36:37.859 --> 01:36:41.929 region:rollup2
MARKET THEN CONSUMERS WILL BE

01:36:39.794 --> 01:36:42.797 region:rollup2
EXPOSED TO THE BADLY GENERATORS

01:36:41.929 --> 01:36:44.232 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO

01:36:42.797 --> 01:36:45.933 region:rollup2
PREVENT.

01:36:44.232 --> 01:36:46.467 region:rollup2
THE MORE PEOPLE THAT PARTICIPATE

01:36:45.933 --> 01:36:48.836 region:rollup2
THE MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:36:46.467 --> 01:36:50.972 region:rollup2
LICENSED. IN THIS INDUSTRY THE

01:36:48.836 --> 01:36:52.273 region:rollup2
MORE CONSUMER PROTECTION WE HAVE

01:36:50.972 --> 01:36:54.842 region:rollup2
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO PUSH THEM

01:36:52.273 --> 01:36:56.577 region:rollup2
OUT BECAUSE IT'S NOT RIGHT.

01:36:54.842 --> 01:36:58.179 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T FIT THE WAY THEY DO

01:36:56.577 --> 01:36:59.681 region:rollup2
BUSINESS YES SINCE YOU.

01:36:58.179 --> 01:37:02.550 region:rollup2
ASSUME PROTECTOR LEAD GENERATOR

01:36:59.681 --> 01:37:03.584 region:rollup2
SO.

01:37:02.550 --> 01:37:05.853 region:rollup2
THE LENDERS.

01:37:03.584 --> 01:37:08.256 region:rollup2
ARM.

01:37:05.853 --> 01:37:10.858 region:rollup2
THE DAILY ADVERTISER THEIR OWN

01:37:08.256 --> 01:37:12.860 region:rollup2
PRODUCT AGO WAS FARGO BANK

01:37:10.858 --> 01:37:13.728 region:rollup2
AMERICA WHATEVER MIGHT.

01:37:12.860 --> 01:37:16.130 region:rollup2
A.

01:37:13.728 --> 01:37:18.933 region:rollup2
BOTH.

01:37:16.130 --> 01:37:21.602 region:rollup2
BY USING YOU.

01:37:18.933 --> 01:37:23.771 region:rollup2
AND MY NOT PAYING MORE PICASA.

01:37:21.602 --> 01:37:26.541 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD PAY YOU.

01:37:23.771 --> 01:37:28.209 region:rollup2
MELISSA I.

01:37:26.541 --> 01:37:29.877 region:rollup2
GO INTO OUR IN A CONTRACT WITH

01:37:28.209 --> 01:37:32.013 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT THAT THAT IS AN

01:37:29.877 --> 01:37:34.148 region:rollup2
EXCELLENT QUESTION. THAT WE ARE

01:37:32.013 --> 01:37:36.951 region:rollup2
A PART OF A LENDERS MARKETING

01:37:34.148 --> 01:37:39.187 region:rollup2
BUDGET AND NINE NINETY NINE

01:37:36.951 --> 01:37:41.289 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE TIME WE ACTUALLY

01:37:39.187 --> 01:37:42.523 region:rollup2
HELP LENDERS REDUCE THEIR

01:37:41.289 --> 01:37:44.058 region:rollup2
MARKETING EXPENSE.

01:37:42.523 --> 01:37:45.727 region:rollup2
SO THE BOTTOM THE BOTTOM LINE IS

01:37:44.058 --> 01:37:47.295 region:rollup2
COST OF ACQUISITION FOR A NEW

01:37:45.727 --> 01:37:48.563 region:rollup2
CUSTOMER. YOU'RE GONNA PAY TO

01:37:47.295 --> 01:37:50.164 region:rollup2
BRING THAT CUSTOMER IN IF YOU DO

01:37:48.563 --> 01:37:51.265 region:rollup2
YOUR OWN MARKETING YOU CAN PAY

01:37:50.164 --> 01:37:53.234 region:rollup2
BRING THAT CUSTOMER AND IF YOU

01:37:51.265 --> 01:37:55.269 region:rollup2
USE A LEAD GENERATOR. THE ONLY

01:37:53.234 --> 01:37:56.971 region:rollup2
REASON WE EXIST THE ONLY REASON

01:37:55.269 --> 01:37:59.173 region:rollup2
PEOPLE DO BUSINESS WITH US IS

01:37:56.971 --> 01:38:01.409 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE USUALLY ALMOST ALWAYS

01:37:59.173 --> 01:38:04.011 region:rollup2
LOWER THEIR COST OF ACQUISITION.

01:38:01.409 --> 01:38:06.414 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF. WE KNOW MARKETING

01:38:04.011 --> 01:38:07.682 region:rollup2
THEY KNOW LENDING.

01:38:06.414 --> 01:38:09.016 region:rollup2
SO WE SPECIALIZE IN WHAT WE DO

01:38:07.682 --> 01:38:09.884 region:rollup2
THEY SPECIALIZE IN WHAT THEY DO

01:38:09.016 --> 01:38:12.220 region:rollup2
SO THEY ACTUALLY SAVE MONEY

01:38:09.884 --> 01:38:14.255 region:rollup2
USING US BUT THEY DO NOT EVER

01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:15.757 region:rollup2
NOR DO WE. PASS THAT COST

01:38:14.255 --> 01:38:17.158 region:rollup2
DIRECTLY ON TO THE CONSUMER WE

01:38:15.757 --> 01:38:18.993 region:rollup2
NEVER CHARGE THE CONSUMER AND

01:38:17.158 --> 01:38:20.595 region:rollup2
YOU WILL NEVER SEE. A LINE ITEM

01:38:18.993 --> 01:38:22.530 region:rollup2
FOR LEAD GENERATION LIKE YOU

01:38:20.595 --> 01:38:24.198 region:rollup2
MIGHT SEE A BROKER'S FEES.

01:38:22.530 --> 01:38:25.933 region:rollup2
I KIND OF AGREE WITH THAT THAT I

01:38:24.198 --> 01:38:27.301 region:rollup2
I WAS A SHOPPING FOR MY YET NOW

01:38:25.933 --> 01:38:29.804 region:rollup2
AIRLINE TICKET.

01:38:27.301 --> 01:38:31.739 region:rollup2
IF YOU GO TO THE AIRLINE ITSELF.

01:38:29.804 --> 01:38:33.274 region:rollup2
THIS OF COURSE IS MORE.

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:35.710 region:rollup2
BUT BUT THE LIKE US SOME OF THE

01:38:33.274 --> 01:38:37.812 region:rollup2
CAR THEIR CORE EXPEDIA THAT

01:38:35.710 --> 01:38:39.280 region:rollup2
SUPER HIM AND I WENT. AND THEIR

01:38:37.812 --> 01:38:39.947 region:rollup2
VILLAGES SO SO I THINK THAT'S A

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:41.616 region:rollup2
LEAD TO GENERATE YEAH I.

01:38:39.947 --> 01:38:42.917 region:rollup2
I I SEE

01:38:41.616 --> 01:38:44.285 region:rollup2
OKAY MAYBE YOU ONE MORE QUESTION

01:38:42.917 --> 01:38:48.289 region:rollup2
NOW.

01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:49.123 region:rollup2
.

01:38:48.289 --> 01:38:51.292 region:rollup2
WHAT KIND OF A CONSUMER

01:38:49.123 --> 01:38:54.128 region:rollup2
PROTECTION DO WE CURRENTLY HAVE

01:38:51.292 --> 01:38:57.231 region:rollup2
OVER THE CURRENT LAW SO FOR THE?

01:38:54.128 --> 01:38:58.399 region:rollup2
IT GOOD TO THE GENEROUS AND THE

01:38:57.231 --> 01:39:00.802 region:rollup2
BAD.

01:38:58.399 --> 01:39:02.970 region:rollup2
THE GENEROUS A HOW CAN WE.

01:39:00.802 --> 01:39:04.639 region:rollup2
DISCOURAGED BY

01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:05.239 region:rollup2
BAD THE GENERATOR SAID NOT TO

01:39:04.639 --> 01:39:06.507 region:rollup2
ACT AS SUCH.

01:39:05.239 --> 01:39:09.010 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

01:39:06.507 --> 01:39:10.211 region:rollup2
AT.

01:39:09.010 --> 01:39:12.480 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST JUST LIKE ALMOST A

01:39:10.211 --> 01:39:15.049 region:rollup2
CHEATED INTO THAT THAT I DIDN'T

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:15.650 region:rollup2
KNOW. WHO ARE SAID DID WITHOUT I

01:39:15.049 --> 01:39:16.684 region:rollup2
THOUGHT ALSO DEALING WITH THE

01:39:15.650 --> 01:39:18.686 region:rollup2
LENDER?

01:39:16.684 --> 01:39:20.488 region:rollup2
SO AND THEN AND THE DIGGING INTO

01:39:18.686 --> 01:39:23.057 region:rollup2
MY PERSONAL INFORMATION. I HAVE

01:39:20.488 --> 01:39:25.226 region:rollup2
NO IDEA. WHAT THEY HAVE DONE

01:39:23.057 --> 01:39:27.829 region:rollup2
WITH MY PERSONAL INFORMATION?

01:39:25.226 --> 01:39:29.630 region:rollup2
THE THE. THE GOOD NEWS FOR THAT

01:39:27.829 --> 01:39:32.266 region:rollup2
POINT IS THE FEDERAL REGULATORS

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:33.968 region:rollup2
BOTH THE FTC AND THE CFPB USE

01:39:32.266 --> 01:39:36.037 region:rollup2
THERE YOU TAP AUTHORITY WHICH

01:39:33.968 --> 01:39:37.805 region:rollup2
PROHIBITS UNFAIR DECEPTIVE AND

01:39:36.037 --> 01:39:38.105 region:rollup2
ABUSIVE ACTS OR PRACTICES.

01:39:37.805 --> 01:39:40.575 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE.

01:39:38.105 --> 01:39:42.143 region:rollup2
SHOULD SHUT DOWN OR PENALIZED

01:39:40.575 --> 01:39:42.710 region:rollup2
SOME WE GENERATORS FOR MAKING

01:39:42.143 --> 01:39:44.545 region:rollup2
MISREPRESENTATIONS OF THEIR

01:39:42.710 --> 01:39:45.847 region:rollup2
MARKETING.

01:39:44.545 --> 01:39:47.448 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS BUSINESS AND

01:39:45.847 --> 01:39:48.549 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONS CODE SEVENTEEN TWO

01:39:47.448 --> 01:39:50.251 region:rollup2
HUNDRED WHICH SIMILARLY

01:39:48.549 --> 01:39:51.853 region:rollup2
PROHIBITS ON UNTRUTHFUL

01:39:50.251 --> 01:39:52.987 region:rollup2
MARKETING.

01:39:51.853 --> 01:39:54.021 region:rollup2
I HAVE AND THE.

01:39:52.987 --> 01:39:56.657 region:rollup2
FINANCE CODES

01:39:54.021 --> 01:39:58.159 region:rollup2
TEAM.

01:39:56.657 --> 01:39:59.694 region:rollup2
SIXTY ONE TWENTY ONE I BELIEVE

01:39:58.159 --> 01:40:01.696 region:rollup2
ALSO PROHIBITS DECEPTIVE

01:39:59.694 --> 01:40:03.130 region:rollup2
MARKETING SO THERE ARE STATUTES

01:40:01.696 --> 01:40:05.299 region:rollup2
ON THE BOOKS THAT CAN BE USED

01:40:03.130 --> 01:40:07.768 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW TO RAIN AND THE BADLY

01:40:05.299 --> 01:40:09.437 region:rollup2
GENERATORS. AND FROM ME YORK

01:40:07.768 --> 01:40:11.305 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY ASSESSING THAT THE

01:40:09.437 --> 01:40:13.140 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAWS ARE REGULATING

01:40:11.305 --> 01:40:14.675 region:rollup2
DEGENERES.

01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:17.712 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAWS ARE THERE BUT I

01:40:14.675 --> 01:40:18.913 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THEY'RE BEING USED

01:40:17.712 --> 01:40:20.648 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S NOT ON A CD SO THERE

01:40:18.913 --> 01:40:22.083 region:rollup2
ARE LAWS THERE BUT THERE IS NOT

01:40:20.648 --> 01:40:22.950 region:rollup2
A REGULATOR FOR IT.

01:40:22.083 --> 01:40:24.652 region:rollup2
THIS WOULD BE THE ATTORNEY

01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:26.320 region:rollup2
GENERAL OR OR A CITY ATTORNEY OR

01:40:24.652 --> 01:40:27.955 region:rollup2
COUNTY ATTORNEY THAT WOULD HAVE

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:29.290 region:rollup2
TO BRING. A.

01:40:27.955 --> 01:40:31.692 region:rollup2
VIOLATIONS UNDER.

01:40:29.290 --> 01:40:32.960 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL CODE SIXTEEN ONE

01:40:31.692 --> 01:40:34.395 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE OR THE BUSINESS AND

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:36.330 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONS CODE OR YOU CAN HAVE

01:40:34.395 --> 01:40:38.132 region:rollup2
A PRIVATE CAUSE OF ACTION. WHICH

01:40:36.330 --> 01:40:39.467 region:rollup2
WE SUPPORT THEY SHOULD BE.

01:40:38.132 --> 01:40:40.935 region:rollup2
UTILIZED IF THERE'S A WAY TO

01:40:39.467 --> 01:40:42.303 region:rollup2
BRING THE DDO.

01:40:40.935 --> 01:40:43.938 region:rollup2
INTO THE ENFORCEMENT PICTURE

01:40:42.303 --> 01:40:45.273 region:rollup2
THAT'S FANTASTIC

01:40:43.938 --> 01:40:46.474 region:rollup2
BUT AGAIN WE WANT THE CONSUMER

01:40:45.273 --> 01:40:48.743 region:rollup2
PROTECTION WE JUST WANTED TO

01:40:46.474 --> 01:40:50.111 region:rollup2
FIND. WITH RESPECT TO THE TWO

01:40:48.743 --> 01:40:51.512 region:rollup2
DIFFRACTED EASE THAT'S ALL I'M

01:40:50.111 --> 01:40:52.613 region:rollup2
WILLING TO WORK TOGETHER

01:40:51.512 --> 01:40:54.115 region:rollup2
COMPROMISED TO COME UP WITH

01:40:52.613 --> 01:40:56.050 region:rollup2
BETTER OVER WORKING TOGETHER

01:40:54.115 --> 01:40:56.684 region:rollup2
YEAH NO WERE ABSOLUTELY WORKING

01:40:56.050 --> 01:40:58.953 region:rollup2
TOGETHER I MEAN AND I THINK AS

01:40:56.684 --> 01:41:00.688 region:rollup2
MR. I'M ROMMEL JUST MENTIONED

01:40:58.953 --> 01:41:02.123 region:rollup2
IT'S LIKE IT'S NEW SPACE RIGHT

01:41:00.688 --> 01:41:03.925 region:rollup2
IT'S COMPLICATED SO IT'S HAVING

01:41:02.123 --> 01:41:05.593 region:rollup2
A DISCUSSION ABOUT. WHAT THE NEW

01:41:03.925 --> 01:41:07.261 region:rollup2
SPACE LOOKS LIKE WHAT THE ONLINE

01:41:05.593 --> 01:41:09.130 region:rollup2
WORLD AYE LOOKS LIKE AND ALSO

01:41:07.261 --> 01:41:09.730 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT WHAT'S IN

01:41:09.130 --> 01:41:12.900 region:rollup2
STATUTE?

01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:15.136 region:rollup2
DOES DEFINE WHAT THE WORLD OF

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:18.172 region:rollup2
OF LENDING ONLINE AND BUT THAT

01:41:15.136 --> 01:41:19.874 region:rollup2
ALSO DISTINGUISHES ON WHAT A

01:41:18.172 --> 01:41:21.509 region:rollup2
MARKETING PRACTICES VERSUS A

01:41:19.874 --> 01:41:24.111 region:rollup2
BROKER PRACTICE AND I THINK THAT

01:41:21.509 --> 01:41:25.579 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. ON THAT

01:41:24.111 --> 01:41:27.982 region:rollup2
IN THE SPAMMING YOU YOU YOU

01:41:25.579 --> 01:41:28.883 region:rollup2
QUITE HONESTLY GAVE AN EXAMPLE

01:41:27.982 --> 01:41:29.951 region:rollup2
TO.

01:41:28.883 --> 01:41:31.986 region:rollup2
WHY THIS IS NEEDED KANKAN

01:41:29.951 --> 01:41:33.788 region:rollup2
COUNSELOR DID YOU MAKE ANY

01:41:31.986 --> 01:41:35.856 region:rollup2
PROPOSED SOURCE OF TO AMEND THE

01:41:33.788 --> 01:41:36.390 region:rollup2
HER BILL? YES WE WE'VE BEEN

01:41:35.856 --> 01:41:38.726 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH.

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:40.795 region:rollup2
THE CHAIRWOMAN AND HER STAFF

01:41:38.726 --> 01:41:43.397 region:rollup2
VERY CLOSELY WE HAVE WORKED ON

01:41:40.795 --> 01:41:45.366 region:rollup2
SOME ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE HIS

01:41:43.397 --> 01:41:47.068 region:rollup2
EACH ISSUE EXCEPT YOU AMENDMENTS

01:41:45.366 --> 01:41:48.002 region:rollup2
IT I THINK IN THE IN THE

01:41:47.068 --> 01:41:50.504 region:rollup2
COMMITTEES.

01:41:48.002 --> 01:41:52.006 region:rollup2
IN THE ANALYSIS FROM FROM THE

01:41:50.504 --> 01:41:53.474 region:rollup2
STAFF THERE ARE A COUPLE OF

01:41:52.006 --> 01:41:55.209 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT DON'T QUITE

01:41:53.474 --> 01:41:57.678 region:rollup2
FIT TOGETHER THINK THE FIRST ONE

01:41:55.209 --> 01:41:59.447 region:rollup2
IS TO. CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF

01:41:57.678 --> 01:42:01.515 region:rollup2
BROKER TO MAKE IT MORE CLEAR.

01:41:59.447 --> 01:42:03.417 region:rollup2
AND THE LAST ONE I BELIEVE IT'S

01:42:01.515 --> 01:42:05.686 region:rollup2
POINT NUMBER NINE IN THE

01:42:03.417 --> 01:42:06.754 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS IS TO SPLIT THE

01:42:05.686 --> 01:42:08.356 region:rollup2
DEFINITIONS.

01:42:06.754 --> 01:42:09.957 region:rollup2
SO THEY KIND OF ARE ARE LOOKING

01:42:08.356 --> 01:42:11.492 region:rollup2
AT BOTH OPTION

01:42:09.957 --> 01:42:12.393 region:rollup2
THIS AND I THINK SPLITTING THE

01:42:11.492 --> 01:42:14.328 region:rollup2
DEFINITIONS IS THE BETTER WAY TO

01:42:12.393 --> 01:42:15.429 region:rollup2
IT TO PROCEED.

01:42:14.328 --> 01:42:17.698 region:rollup2
S. USE IS NOT THERE YET IT'S NOT

01:42:15.429 --> 01:42:20.134 region:rollup2
THERE YET.

01:42:17.698 --> 01:42:20.968 region:rollup2
MISS BURKE.

01:42:20.134 --> 01:42:22.970 region:rollup2
NO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I

01:42:20.968 --> 01:42:24.705 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND SO ARE ARE WE WORKING

01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:27.008 region:rollup2
TOWARDS A DEFINITION FOR LEAD

01:42:24.705 --> 01:42:29.443 region:rollup2
GENERATION GENERATOR SEPARATE

01:42:27.008 --> 01:42:31.145 region:rollup2
FROM A BROKER OR.

01:42:29.443 --> 01:42:32.179 region:rollup2
WHERE ARE WE PLANNING I JUST

01:42:31.145 --> 01:42:33.614 region:rollup2
WANNA GET IDEA WERE PLAYING

01:42:32.179 --> 01:42:35.483 region:rollup2
ONLINE BECAUSE THEY ARE TWO VERY

01:42:33.614 --> 01:42:37.385 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THINGS I MEAN?

01:42:35.483 --> 01:42:39.153 region:rollup2
I AM A BROKER SO I A LEAD

01:42:37.385 --> 01:42:40.788 region:rollup2
GENERATOR IS IS JUST ESSENTIALLY

01:42:39.153 --> 01:42:41.889 region:rollup2
AN ADVERTISER AND I REALIZED ERA

01:42:40.788 --> 01:42:42.923 region:rollup2
IT ACCESS TO SENSITIVE

01:42:41.889 --> 01:42:44.525 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND I WANT THAT

01:42:42.923 --> 01:42:45.893 region:rollup2
PROTECTED JUST LIKE ANYBODY ELSE

01:42:44.525 --> 01:42:48.696 region:rollup2
ANYONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND.

01:42:45.893 --> 01:42:50.031 region:rollup2
HOWEVER EIGHT I AM CURIOUS ARE

01:42:48.696 --> 01:42:51.766 region:rollup2
WE MOVING TOWARDS A SEPARATE

01:42:50.031 --> 01:42:53.134 region:rollup2
DEFINITION FOR A LEAD GENERATOR

01:42:51.766 --> 01:42:54.869 region:rollup2
AND A SEPARATE DEFINITION FOR A

01:42:53.134 --> 01:42:55.870 region:rollup2
BROKER AND IS THAT PLANNING ON

01:42:54.869 --> 01:42:57.505 region:rollup2
BEING A DIFFERENT KIND OF

01:42:55.870 --> 01:43:00.041 region:rollup2
LICENSE. UNDER A BROKER'S

01:42:57.505 --> 01:43:01.876 region:rollup2
LICENSE OR WHAT IS THAT AND WHAT

01:43:00.041 --> 01:43:03.644 region:rollup2
DO YOU SEE AS THE ANGLE SO WE'RE

01:43:01.876 --> 01:43:05.112 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH DB O. TO ACTUALLY

01:43:03.644 --> 01:43:06.514 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH THIS I THINK THAT

01:43:05.112 --> 01:43:07.648 region:rollup2
THERE IS A SPACE TO LOOK AT

01:43:06.514 --> 01:43:09.150 region:rollup2
THESE AS DIFFERENT THINGS BUT I

01:43:07.648 --> 01:43:10.418 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY JUST WHAT. YOU KNOW

01:43:09.150 --> 01:43:13.688 region:rollup2
BACK TO WHAT WAS SPENT WITH BEEN

01:43:10.418 --> 01:43:14.855 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED IS THERE IS A VERY

01:43:13.688 --> 01:43:16.891 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DIFFERENT IN PRACTICE

01:43:14.855 --> 01:43:18.659 region:rollup2
I MEAN ONE YOU KNOW GIVING OUT A

01:43:16.891 --> 01:43:19.860 region:rollup2
LOT OF THE GENERAL CAN'T ABOUT.

01:43:18.659 --> 01:43:21.262 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S THAT'S

01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:24.598 region:rollup2
THE GOAL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

01:43:21.262 --> 01:43:26.667 region:rollup2
DEFINE THESE IN A WAY AND THAT I

01:43:24.598 --> 01:43:27.802 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. ESSENTIALLY CFL

01:43:26.667 --> 01:43:29.403 region:rollup2
LENDERS WOULD HAVE TO WORK WITH

01:43:27.802 --> 01:43:31.072 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF YOU KNOW LICENSED

01:43:29.403 --> 01:43:37.912 region:rollup2
BROKER AND THAT'S WHAT WE HOPE

01:43:31.072 --> 01:43:39.280 region:rollup2
THE BILL WITH THE.

01:43:37.912 --> 01:43:40.381 region:rollup2
AB I AM I AM BUT I JUST WANNA

01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:42.049 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THE

01:43:40.381 --> 01:43:42.817 region:rollup2
FRIGHT BECAUSE I BEFORE I.

01:43:42.049 --> 01:43:44.018 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I WAS LEANING TOWARDS

01:43:42.817 --> 01:43:45.586 region:rollup2
NOT VOTING BUT IF YOU'RE

01:43:44.018 --> 01:43:47.922 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY MOVING TOWARDS. THE

01:43:45.586 --> 01:43:49.323 region:rollup2
ACTUAL DEFINITION THAT SEPARATE

01:43:47.922 --> 01:43:50.558 region:rollup2
FOR A LEAD GENERATOR THAT'S A

01:43:49.323 --> 01:43:52.760 region:rollup2
THAT'S A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION

01:43:50.558 --> 01:43:54.829 region:rollup2
AND OBVIOUSLY REGULATING THEM IS

01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:56.130 region:rollup2
IS FAIR AND NECESSARY ON BECAUSE

01:43:54.829 --> 01:43:58.132 region:rollup2
OF WHAT THEY'RE.

01:43:56.130 --> 01:43:59.700 region:rollup2
HAVE ACCESS TO SOME JUST DON'T

01:43:58.132 --> 01:44:01.969 region:rollup2
TRY TO FIGURE OUT IS. IS THE

01:43:59.700 --> 01:44:02.870 region:rollup2
GOAL TO HAVE.

01:44:01.969 --> 01:44:05.573 region:rollup2
S. SEPARATE KIND OF.

01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:07.108 region:rollup2
DEFINITION OF THEM UNDER A

01:44:05.573 --> 01:44:08.209 region:rollup2
BROKER'S LIFE LIKE UNDER A

01:44:07.108 --> 01:44:11.846 region:rollup2
BROKER'S LICENSE OR WILL THEY

01:44:08.209 --> 01:44:12.480 region:rollup2
STILL IN YOUR PURVIEW BE LICENSE

01:44:11.846 --> 01:44:13.647 region:rollup2
AS A PROCREATING THOUGH THEY'RE

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:15.349 region:rollup2
NOT DOING BROKER ACTIVITIES.

01:44:13.647 --> 01:44:16.951 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS

01:44:15.349 --> 01:44:18.252 region:rollup2
A BETTER DEFINITION OF BOTH BUT

01:44:16.951 --> 01:44:19.787 region:rollup2
WE ARE ALSO WAITING FOR THE

01:44:18.252 --> 01:44:23.357 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION TO CARVE OUT EXACTLY

01:44:19.787 --> 01:44:25.159 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE.

01:44:23.357 --> 01:44:26.660 region:rollup2
MISTER CALDERON.

01:44:25.159 --> 01:44:28.028 region:rollup2
BOB MONTH THANK EVERYBODY FOR

01:44:26.660 --> 01:44:28.863 region:rollup2
BEING HERE AND FOR THE TESTIMONY

01:44:28.028 --> 01:44:30.030 region:rollup2
IN FOR THE AUTHOR'S WORK ON THIS

01:44:28.863 --> 01:44:32.566 region:rollup2
BILL.

01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:33.868 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW. LEE GENERATOR GOING

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:35.202 region:rollup2
GOOGLE I NEED OF SMALL LOAN

01:44:33.868 --> 01:44:37.705 region:rollup2
LATIMES FIRST THING THAT POPS UP

01:44:35.202 --> 01:44:39.306 region:rollup2
AS A LEAD GENERATOR LA TIMES IN

01:44:37.705 --> 01:44:42.143 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE. BEST LOAN.

01:44:39.306 --> 01:44:43.644 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT IT AND SO I I THINK

01:44:42.143 --> 01:44:45.780 region:rollup2
WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE

01:44:43.644 --> 01:44:47.581 region:rollup2
STATE TO DO IS TO IDENTIFY A

01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:49.083 region:rollup2
REGULATORY BODY THAT HAVE

01:44:47.581 --> 01:44:51.952 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY HAS TO HAPPEN.

01:44:49.083 --> 01:44:53.487 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT IT LEAVES OUT

01:44:51.952 --> 01:44:54.221 region:rollup2
WITHOUT ONE IT LEADS TO

01:44:53.487 --> 01:44:55.656 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL OR.

01:44:54.221 --> 01:44:57.424 region:rollup2
.

01:44:55.656 --> 01:44:59.059 region:rollup2
THE MORE.

01:44:57.424 --> 01:45:00.794 region:rollup2
PREVALENCE OF UNSCRUPULOUS WAYS

01:44:59.059 --> 01:45:03.531 region:rollup2
OF BEING ABLE TO TRACK BUSINESS

01:45:00.794 --> 01:45:06.033 region:rollup2
TO OUR OUTSIDE DIFFERENT LENDERS

01:45:03.531 --> 01:45:07.802 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE LEAD GENERATOR. AND.

01:45:06.033 --> 01:45:08.502 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:45:07.802 --> 01:45:09.937 region:rollup2
THAT OBVIOUSLY PEOPLE'S

01:45:08.502 --> 01:45:11.672 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AND IS PROTECTED

01:45:09.937 --> 01:45:13.541 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY. ARE IMPORTANT

01:45:11.672 --> 01:45:15.543 region:rollup2
PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT WE

01:45:13.541 --> 01:45:17.845 region:rollup2
ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:45:15.543 --> 01:45:20.514 region:rollup2
THERE AS A STATE WE ARE PAYING

01:45:17.845 --> 01:45:22.049 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO WHO IS.

01:45:20.514 --> 01:45:24.785 region:rollup2
OPERATING AS A LEAD GENERATOR

01:45:22.049 --> 01:45:26.787 region:rollup2
AND THE WAY IN WHICH THEY'RE.

01:45:24.785 --> 01:45:28.455 region:rollup2
THERE THE SERVICING WHOEVER AND

01:45:26.787 --> 01:45:30.057 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BEING PAID BY.

01:45:28.455 --> 01:45:31.358 region:rollup2
ARE AND AND THAT'S WHY I THINK

01:45:30.057 --> 01:45:33.260 region:rollup2
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MOVE FORWARD

01:45:31.358 --> 01:45:34.261 region:rollup2
ON YOUR RAN.

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:34.795 region:rollup2
I'D MADAM CHAIR ON THE

01:45:34.261 --> 01:45:37.264 region:rollup2
DEFINITION.

01:45:34.795 --> 01:45:37.865 region:rollup2
.

01:45:37.264 --> 01:45:39.867 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE UNFAIR TO

01:45:37.865 --> 01:45:41.235 region:rollup2
SAY WE WILL.

01:45:39.867 --> 01:45:42.536 region:rollup2
A DEFINITION OF A BROKER YOU

01:45:41.235 --> 01:45:44.772 region:rollup2
HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE YOU'RE

01:45:42.536 --> 01:45:45.973 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIGHT FOR THE BEST.

01:45:44.772 --> 01:45:47.308 region:rollup2
A POSSIBLE DEAL FOR WOULD BE

01:45:45.973 --> 01:45:48.742 region:rollup2
YOUR CLIENT IS WHICH IS SUPPOSED

01:45:47.308 --> 01:45:50.411 region:rollup2
TO BE THE INDIVIDUAL.

01:45:48.742 --> 01:45:52.813 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK.

01:45:50.411 --> 01:45:55.249 region:rollup2
THE THE PIECE IN THIS BILL ALONE

01:45:52.813 --> 01:45:58.219 region:rollup2
ABOUT ESTABLISHING.

01:45:55.249 --> 01:45:59.553 region:rollup2
A REGULATORY AGENCY IS I BELIEVE

01:45:58.219 --> 01:46:00.988 region:rollup2
THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE I THINK

01:45:59.553 --> 01:46:02.389 region:rollup2
DEFINITIONS ARE REALLY A LOT OF

01:46:00.988 --> 01:46:04.191 region:rollup2
TIMES YOU CAN SOLVE DEFINITION

01:46:02.389 --> 01:46:05.726 region:rollup2
BY ADDING A COM OR PERIOD. AT

01:46:04.191 --> 01:46:07.695 region:rollup2
OUT YOU KNOW SEVEN SOME MY BILL

01:46:05.726 --> 01:46:10.064 region:rollup2
SO. YOU KNOW OR MAYBE A ADDING

01:46:07.695 --> 01:46:11.699 region:rollup2
AN AND OR OR SO I DON'T THINK

01:46:10.064 --> 01:46:12.166 region:rollup2
IT'S A THAT'S A HARD HURDLE TO

01:46:11.699 --> 01:46:14.301 region:rollup2
OVERCOME SEEMS PRETTY

01:46:12.166 --> 01:46:15.336 region:rollup2
REASONABLE.

01:46:14.301 --> 01:46:16.604 region:rollup2
ABOUT WE HAVE TO AS A STATE TO

01:46:15.336 --> 01:46:18.806 region:rollup2
SALVAGE A REGULATORY BODY TO

01:46:16.604 --> 01:46:20.007 region:rollup2
OVERSEE THIS AND TO MANAGE IT SO

01:46:18.806 --> 01:46:20.708 region:rollup2
I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE AUTHOR TO

01:46:20.007 --> 01:46:23.244 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE

01:46:20.708 --> 01:46:24.378 region:rollup2
DEFINITIONAL. ISSUES HERE UP BUT

01:46:23.244 --> 01:46:25.613 region:rollup2
THEN ALSO ENCOURAGE THE

01:46:24.378 --> 01:46:27.014 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION TO UNDERSTAND THE

01:46:25.613 --> 01:46:28.949 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF THE VALUE AND THE

01:46:27.014 --> 01:46:30.117 region:rollup2
STATE INTEREST IN IDENTIFYING A

01:46:28.949 --> 01:46:31.051 region:rollup2
STATE AGENCY TO REGULATE THE

01:46:30.117 --> 01:46:33.520 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY.

01:46:31.051 --> 01:46:34.989 region:rollup2
AND HOW BY VERIFIED BUSINESSES

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:36.056 region:rollup2
LIKE YOURSELF YOU KNOW MAYBE

01:46:34.989 --> 01:46:38.092 region:rollup2
CREATE A PROGRAM WHERE YOU GET

01:46:36.056 --> 01:46:39.493 region:rollup2
THE PATH AT A VERIFIED CHECKING

01:46:38.092 --> 01:46:41.695 region:rollup2
VERIFIED.

01:46:39.493 --> 01:46:43.030 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WORD ON YOUR WEBSITE

01:46:41.695 --> 01:46:45.1000 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE AREN'T BEING

01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:47.801 region:rollup2
DUPED BY. OTHERS BAD ACTORS.

01:46:45.1000 --> 01:46:49.136 region:rollup2
YOU NOW YEAH YOU MAY FIND A WAY

01:46:47.801 --> 01:46:50.471 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT AYE THAT

01:46:49.136 --> 01:46:51.805 region:rollup2
CERTAIN THAT WOULD MAKE PEOPLE

01:46:50.471 --> 01:46:54.241 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND ARE NO WITHOUT A

01:46:51.805 --> 01:46:55.209 region:rollup2
DOUBT THAT THEY ARE OPERATING

01:46:54.241 --> 01:46:56.043 region:rollup2
WITH A LICENSED.

01:46:55.209 --> 01:46:57.278 region:rollup2
BUSINESS WITH THE STATE THAT HAS

01:46:56.043 --> 01:46:58.479 region:rollup2
ARE ACTING IN IN IN THE BEST WAY

01:46:57.278 --> 01:46:59.947 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE BUT I THINK THAT THIS

01:46:58.479 --> 01:47:02.716 region:rollup2
BILL IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:46:59.947 --> 01:47:05.152 region:rollup2
JUST ALONE TO ESTABLISH.

01:47:02.716 --> 01:47:05.919 region:rollup2
A REGULATORY AGENCY SO. I AM

01:47:05.152 --> 01:47:07.221 region:rollup2
GONNA BE VOTING FOR THE BILL I

01:47:05.919 --> 01:47:08.822 region:rollup2
MOVE THE BILL HAS ALREADY BEEN

01:47:07.221 --> 01:47:10.291 region:rollup2
BEEN MOVED AND ENCOURAGES

01:47:08.822 --> 01:47:13.827 region:rollup2
SECONDS AND.

01:47:10.291 --> 01:47:14.628 region:rollup2
THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK.

01:47:13.827 --> 01:47:20.200 region:rollup2
THE BILL HAS BEEN REVISED

01:47:14.628 --> 01:47:21.435 region:rollup2
CALDERON.

01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:23.470 region:rollup2
MADAM CHAIR DO YOU HAVE A

01:47:21.435 --> 01:47:24.672 region:rollup2
QUESTION I TRULY APPRECIATE A

01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:26.440 region:rollup2
YOU BRING THIS BILL THWARTED

01:47:24.672 --> 01:47:27.941 region:rollup2
YOU'D THINK THAT THE. DEFINITION

01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:29.443 region:rollup2
OF BROKERS WHO IS OVERLY BROAD.

01:47:27.941 --> 01:47:32.046 region:rollup2
BUT IN TERMS OF READING THIS

01:47:29.443 --> 01:47:35.049 region:rollup2
BILL IT DOES ALSO SEEMED THAT.

01:47:32.046 --> 01:47:36.583 region:rollup2
UNDER THIS CURRENT LANGUAGE THAT

01:47:35.049 --> 01:47:38.218 region:rollup2
LEGIONARIES STILL BE CLASSIFIED

01:47:36.583 --> 01:47:39.119 region:rollup2
UNDER BROKERS BUT IT ALSO SEEMS

01:47:38.218 --> 01:47:41.021 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS DISTINCTLY

01:47:39.119 --> 01:47:42.289 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES OF

01:47:41.021 --> 01:47:43.757 region:rollup2
THESE BOTH DIFFERENT.

01:47:42.289 --> 01:47:45.993 region:rollup2
OPPOSITIONS IF YOU WILL.

01:47:43.757 --> 01:47:47.995 region:rollup2
BUT THAT IS THE CASE.

01:47:45.993 --> 01:47:50.364 region:rollup2
WHY ISN'T THERE A SUPPER

01:47:47.995 --> 01:47:50.831 region:rollup2
DEFINITION FOR BOTH AND IF IT'S

01:47:50.364 --> 01:47:51.999 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE A SEPARATE

01:47:50.831 --> 01:47:53.867 region:rollup2
DEFINITION?

01:47:51.999 --> 01:47:57.071 region:rollup2
WILL IT BE SOMETHING UP REQUIRED

01:47:53.867 --> 01:47:57.905 region:rollup2
TO BE A CHANGE IN THE STATUTE.

01:47:57.071 --> 01:47:58.872 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT

01:47:57.905 --> 01:47:59.840 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO WORK ON ACTUALLY

01:47:58.872 --> 01:48:02.276 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:04.311 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ON WHAT THAT BROKER

01:48:02.276 --> 01:48:05.479 region:rollup2
DEFINITION IS NOW AND WHAT A

01:48:04.311 --> 01:48:08.015 region:rollup2
SEPARATE DEFINITION WOULD LOOK

01:48:05.479 --> 01:48:09.750 region:rollup2
LIKE. ON IT'S ACTUALLY NO I MEAN

01:48:08.015 --> 01:48:10.784 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT AS EASY AS.

01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:11.418 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH WORDS AND PUT THEM

01:48:10.784 --> 01:48:13.454 region:rollup2
TOGETHER IT'S REALLY

01:48:11.418 --> 01:48:15.089 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THE PRACTICE THAT

01:48:13.454 --> 01:48:15.923 region:rollup2
GOES BEHIND AS I AM TO COME UP

01:48:15.089 --> 01:48:17.124 region:rollup2
TOGETHER SO I JUST WANT TO BE

01:48:15.923 --> 01:48:19.126 region:rollup2
CLEAR THAT LIKE IT'S ACTUALLY

01:48:17.124 --> 01:48:20.327 region:rollup2
BEEN. A MUCH MORE THOROUGH IN

01:48:19.126 --> 01:48:23.297 region:rollup2
DEPTH CONVERSATION.

01:48:20.327 --> 01:48:24.932 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WE CAN COME UP WITH

01:48:23.297 --> 01:48:26.367 region:rollup2
DEFINITIONS JUST YOU KNOW BY.

01:48:24.932 --> 01:48:27.267 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE IN AND IN

01:48:26.367 --> 01:48:28.369 region:rollup2
DICTIONARY WITH THESE THINGS

01:48:27.267 --> 01:48:29.937 region:rollup2
MEAN BUT IT'S REALLY

01:48:28.369 --> 01:48:32.139 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE PRACTICE

01:48:29.937 --> 01:48:34.108 region:rollup2
HAS BECOME NOW AND THAT'S WHAT I

01:48:32.139 --> 01:48:35.609 region:rollup2
THINK YOU HEARD BOTH SUPPORTERS

01:48:34.108 --> 01:48:37.011 region:rollup2
AND OPPOSITION SAYING THAT

01:48:35.609 --> 01:48:38.846 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON.

01:48:37.011 --> 01:48:40.481 region:rollup2
AND TO COME UP WITH A DEFINITION

01:48:38.846 --> 01:48:46.553 region:rollup2
NOT JUST THAT DEFINES IT BUT

01:48:40.481 --> 01:48:47.121 region:rollup2
THAT MATCHES WHAT IS HAPPENING.

01:48:46.553 --> 01:48:47.955 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE

01:48:47.121 --> 01:48:49.356 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

01:48:47.955 --> 01:48:50.457 region:rollup2
ANNOUNCING NON.

DOCTOR CHOI.

01:48:53.394 --> 01:48:57.664 region:rollup2
NOT BASED UPON YOUR YOUR

01:48:55.062 --> 01:49:00.434 region:rollup2
EXPLANATION IF YOU AGREE UPON

01:48:57.664 --> 01:49:02.136 region:rollup2
DEFINITION WHAT THE DEGENERATE

01:49:00.434 --> 01:49:05.005 region:rollup2
WHICH GENERATORS ARE. WHAT

01:49:02.136 --> 01:49:07.141 region:rollup2
BROKERS ARE WHAT I HEARD IN THE

01:49:05.005 --> 01:49:08.208 region:rollup2
