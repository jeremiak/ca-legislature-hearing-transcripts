ADAM VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES AB THIRTY TO TWELVE UPDATES AN EXPANSIVE CALIFORNIA MILITARY AND VETERAN'S CHO. TO INCREASE MILITARY CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN ORDER TO MORE EFFECTIVELY SAFEGUARD OUR SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. UNDER CURRENT LAW MANY OF THE PROTECTIONS IN CODE QUICKLY EXPIRE AFTER SERVICEMEN A SERVICE MEMBER LEAVES ACTIVE DUTY AB THIRTY TO TWELVE WILL HELP THOSE WHO STRUGGLE TO RE INTEGRATE AFTER DEPLOYMENT BY EXTENDING THE TIME FRAME. THAT'S MEMBERS RECEIVE PROTECTION FROM EVICTION AND NON JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE UP TO A HUNDRED AND TWENTY DAYS AFTER LEAVING ACTIVE DUTY. THE BILL ALSO ADDS THAT OUR STATE'S FULL TIME ACTIVE COMPONENT PERSONNEL RECEIVE EQUIVALENT PROTECTIONS AS PROVIDED UNDER THE FEDERAL SERVICE MEMBERS. CIVIL RELIEF ACT. IN ADDITION TO EXPANDING THE REACH OF THOSE WHO WOULD BE PROTECTED THE BILL ALSO INCORPORATE CERTAIN PROTECTIONS THAT ARE FOUND ONLY IN THE FEDERAL SCR A. HAVE A COUPLE OF WITNESS HEARS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. GOOD AFTERNOON MR VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHARLES HARVEY ON BEHALF OF THE OFFICE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVE YET ETCETERA. THOSE SPONSORED TO ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY TO TWELVE. AND ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE I'D LIKE TO THANK THE MEMBER IRWIN FOR HER LEADERSHIP. AND THIS AREA FOR AUTHORING IS IMPORTANT BILL. I'M EAGER TO SEE TWELVE THE SENSIBLE CONSUMER PROTECTION MEASURE THAT SEEKS TO EASE THE LEGAL AND FINANCIAL BURDENS PLACED ON CALIFORNIA SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES BROUGHT ON BY THE DEMANDS OF ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE. THE BILL ALSO AIMS TO MAKE HOW FREE A LOT LEAST AS PROTECTIVE FOR SERVICE MEMBERS AS A CORRESPONDENT FEDERAL LAW. AS IT STANDS TODAY AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER ONCE MENTION MANY THE PROTECTIONS CURRENTLY AFFORDED A TO OUR SERVICE MEMBERS UNDER STATE LAW EXPIRE VERY QUICKLY AFTER SERVICE NUMBER THESE ACTIVE DUTY. AND IT'S PROBLEMATIC COURSE BUT CAN'T BECAUSE SERVICE MEMBERS NEED TIME AFTER DEPLOYMENT TO. REINTEGRATE AND MAY FACE FINANCIAL DISTRESS DURING THIS TRANSITION PERIOD. AB THERE'S A TWELVE WOULD EXTEND THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT SERVICE MEMBERS RECEIVE BEARS PROTECTIONS AS NOTED TACKLING THOSE AGAINST DEFAULT JUDGMENT AND NOT JUST FORECLOSURE. TO A TWO HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS AFTER LEAVING ACTIVE DUTY. BILL ALSO INCORPORATES. BEARS PROTECTIONS FOUND ONLY IN THE US YOU ARE A. AYE INCLUDING. RIGHTS FROM THE MOTOR VEHICLE LEASES EXPANDED PROTECTIONS AGAINST LEAN SALES AND MAKING CLEAR. THAT INTEREST ABOVE THE SIX PERCENT CAP ON PRE SERVICE OBLIGATIONS IS FORGIVEN AND NOT MERELY TO FOR. AND FINALLY OUR STATE LAWS CURRENT MILITARY CONSUMER PROTECTIONS APPLY ONLY TO MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE COMPONENTS. THEY DO NOT THEIR BIKES INTO THE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND. ALL TIME MEMBERS OF THE ACTIVE COMPONENTOF THE ARMED FORCES WHO LIVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AB THIRTY TO TWELVE ADDRESSES ITS MISSION BY MAKING THE STATE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AVAILABLE. TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES INCLUDING THESE ACT COMPONENT PERSONNEL. TAKEN TOGETHER THE PROPOSED CHANGES IN THIS BILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARD BETTER PROTECTING CALIFORNIA SERVICE MEMBERS INCLUDING DURING BOTH CRITICAL POST DEPLOYMENT IN POST SEPARATION PERIODS. I'M JOINED HERE BY MY COLLEAGUE. NICK ACRES MEMBER OF THE STATE MILITARY RESERVE AND ALSO SENIOR SEASON ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO OVERSEES THE DOJ'S CONSUMER LAW SECTION. I HOPE YOUR BRIEF REMARKS AND IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. ASK YOUR SUPPORT. GET FILIBUSTERED HELD MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS NICK ACRES I'M THE SENIOR ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL IN CHARGE OF THE CONSUMER LAS ACTION. IN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS MISTER HARVEY INDICATOR NAM ALSO HAVE FIFTEEN YEARS OF SERVICE IN THE STATE MILITARY RESERVE AS A JUDGE ADVOCATE AND SPENT MUCH OF THAT TIME PROVIDING LEGAL ASSISTANCE. TWO SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN AND FAMILIES FROM THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL GUARD. AFTER THE LAST FIVE YEARS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S CONSUMER LAW SECTION HAS UNDERTAKEN A TARGETED EFFORT TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S MILITARY VETERAN COMMUNITY. THAT INCLUDES OUTREACH TRAINING FOR ACTIVE DUTY AND RESERVE COMPONENT JAG OFFICERS AND MILITARY FINANCIAL COUNSELORS AND TARGETED LAWSUITS AND CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS UNDER BOTH MILITARY VETERANS CODE. AND OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS. A NUMBER OF THOSE CASES ARE THE DIRECT RESULT OF REFERRALS FOR OUR PARTNER IN THE MILITARY AND VETERANS COMMUNITY AND PARTICULARLY FROM NAVY AND MARINE CORPS JUDGE ADVOCATES. AND CIVILIAN LEGAL ASSISTANCE ATTORNEYS AT NAVY BASE SAN DIEGO CAMP PENDLETON AND MC RD. I WOULD ALSO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE US DEPARTMENT JUSTICE THE STATE AND FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND OUR OTHER FEDERAL STATE LOCAL AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS ON THESE CASES. AB THIRTY TO TWELVE IS A PRODUCT OF THAT EXPERIENCE AND THE INSIGHTS EXPERIENCE WE RECEIVED BOTH FROM OUR PARTNERS IN THE JAG LEGAL ASSISTANCE AND MILITARY FINANCIAL COUNSELOR COMMUNITY. BUT ALSO FROM INDIVIDUAL SERVICE MEMBERS AND MILITARY FAMILY MEMBERS WHO CONTACTED OUR OFFICE AB THIRTY TO TWELVE IMPROVE CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING MILITARY CONSUMER PROTECTIONS IN TWO WAYS. FIRST IT WOULD MAKE THE EXISTING LOT MORE EFFECTIVE BY FILLING GAPS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN THE COURSE OF OUR WORK. ENSURING THEIR LAW REMAINS AS EFFECTIVE THE FEDERALISTS YOU ARE A AND BY EXTENDING THE DURATION THAT SERVICE MEMBERS RECEIVE CERTAIN PROTECTIONS INCLUDING FORECLOSURE ADDICTION REPOSSESSION PROTECTIONS. AFTER THE TRANSITION BACK TO CIVILIAN LIFE SECOND IT WOULD EXTEND SELECTED PROTECTIONS WHICH CURRENTLY ONLY COVER MEMBERS THE GARDEN RESERVE. TO MEMBERS OF THE ACTIVE COMPONENTS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS LEGISLATION AND WOULD BE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE. ANY OTHER SUPPORTERS. CRAFTING THEIR MINDSET THREE BUT THREE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS MANY OF OUR CLIENTS HAVE NOT RESPONDED THIS LEGISLATION YET HOWEVER THEY HAVE SUPPORTED THIS TYPE OF LEGISLATION IN THE PAST. THANK YOU.

TO SOMEBODY WHO'S ETS AND GOT A MARINE CORPS HAS THAT CAR ISN'T. MAYBE IT'S ALL THE BEHIND ON PAYMENTS IT IT'S NOT GOING TO PROTECT THEM AGAINST ANY FORMER REPOSSESSION BUT IT WILL MEAN THAT A CREDITORS CAN HAVE GOT QUIRK TO REPOSSESS THAT VEHICLE.

POSSIBILITIES OF REFINANCING OR OTHER OPTIONS FOR THAT VEHICLE AND. AND ESSENTIALLY SERGEI. JUST A COOLING OFF PERIOD OF HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS ALLOWED.
