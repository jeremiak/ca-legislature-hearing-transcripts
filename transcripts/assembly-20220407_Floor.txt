ASSEMBLY CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ONE SIXTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER REYES AND OTHERS RELATIVE TO RAMADAN. MS REYES. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS. ACR ONE SIXTY EIGHT RECOGNIZES RAMADAN A MONTH IT IS IMPORTANT TO NEARLY A QUARTER OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION AND OVER ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS. FIVE DAYS AGO WAS THE FIRST DAY OF FASTING FOR CALIFORNIA MUSLIMS. AND FOR MUSLIMS AROUND THE WORLD AS THEY BEGAN THE THIRTY DAYS OF FASTING FROM SUN UP. TO SUN DOWN FOR THE MONTH OF RAMADAN. RAMADAN IS A TIME FOR REFLECTION AND SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE THAT EMBODIES WHAT WE ALL HOLD DEAR WHICH IS DEVOTION TO FAITH. TIME WITH FAMILY AND SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY. A KEY COMPONENT OF RAMADAN IS TO EXPERIENCE HUNGER AND THIRST TO DEVELOP EMPATHY FOR THOSE FACING HARDSHIPS DUE TO POVERTY. THIS EMPATHY EVOLVES INTO AN OBLIGATION TOWARD CHARITABLE GIVING AND COMMUNITY SERVICE FOR THOSE IN NEED. THROUGH THAT SPIRIT OF SERVICE MANY. MUSLIM ORGANIZATIONS STATEWIDE PROVIDE FOOD DISTRIBUTION OTHER RESOURCES TO THOSE IN NEED. OUR OWN ASSEMBLY CHAPLAIN IMAM YASIR KHAN. LEADS AN ORGANIZATION THAT PROVIDES FOOD BOXES TO THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES IN THE SACRAMENTO AND SURROUNDING REGIONS REGARDLESS OF THEIR FAITH. THESE EFFORTS ARE VITAL IN OUR STTE WHERE AS MANY AS ONE IN FIVE CALIFORNIANS CURRENTLY STRUGGLE WITH FOOD INSECURITY. THE MUSLIM AMERICAN COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO BE A PILLAR OF CALIFORNIA MAKING OF CALIFORNIA. MAKING RAMADAN PART OF THE FABRIC OF CALIFORNIA'S DIVERSITY AND HISTORY. MEMBERS I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON ACR ONE SIX EIGHT SO THAT WE CAN COLLECTIVELY WHERE'S OUR MUSLIM FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS A BLESSED RAMADAN. THANK YOU MS REYES MR GABRIEL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER SPEAKER I RISE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ACR ONE SIXTY EIGHT I WANT TO EXTEND THE WARMEST WISHES- AND RAMADAN GREETINGS RAMADAN MUBARAK RAMADAN KAREEM TO ALL OF OUR WITH SOME FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS HERE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE WORLD. AND I KNOW WE ALL OF US I THINK- ARE SO IMPRESSED BY THE INCREDIBLE DEVOTION AND SELF DISCIPLINE THE DEVOTION TO FAITH AND TO COMMUNITY. THAT IT TAKES FOR MUSLIM NEIGHBORS TO OBSERVE RAMADAN TO FAST EVERY SINGLE DAY WITHOUT FOOD OR WATER. AND I READ AN INCREDIBLE ARTICLE LAST NIGHT IN THE WASHINGTON POST ABOUT ALL OF THE SERVICE WORKERS MUSLIM SERVICE WORKERS PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO WORK IN THE FOOD INDUSTRY WHO PREPARE FOOD ALL DAY WHILE THEY'RE FASTING AN INCREDIBLE SELF DISCIPLINE THAT THAT TAKES. AND ALSO AS OUR MAJORITY LEADER SPOKE ABOUT THE WAY IN WHICH OUR MUSLIM COMMUNITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS SO FOCUSED ON GIVING BACK I HAD A DAY OF SERVICE IN MY DISTRICT ON SUNDAY. AND I WAS SO IMPRESSED AND DELIGHTED TO SEE SO MANY MEMBERS OF OUR MUSLIM COMMUNITY IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY THEY CAME OUT EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE FASTING EVEN THOUGH THEY COULDN'T DRINK WATER TO COME DO ACTS OF SERVICE TO WORK. AND THAT KIND OF SPIRIT OF COMMUNITY SPIRIT OF GIVING BACK I THINK REFLECTS THE BEST OF WHAT THE COMMUNITY IS ALL ABOUT IN THE BEST OF WHAT THE VALUES THAT WE ASPIRE TO HEAR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO. ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH CAUCUS ON BEHALF OF THE JEWISH COMMUNITY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- STRONG SUPPORT FOR A C. SAID RAMADAN. THANKS MISS GABRIEL SEE NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION.
