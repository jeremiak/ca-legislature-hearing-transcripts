BUDGET IF THAT'S THEIR THING CAO. AND MISTER REALLY THE PROTAGONIST ITEM ALONG WITH. SOMEONE IRWIN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THIS PROPOSAL WILL CREATE A NEW MORE FLEXIBLE STATE SAVINGS ACCOUNT. TO WHETHER THE STATE'S BOOM AND BUST REVENUE CYCLE IN INSULATOR STATES RESIDENTS FROM CUTS MADE DURING RECESSIONS. THE BUDGET DEFICIT SAVINGS ACCOUNT WILL BE AN ACCOUNT IS COMPLEMENTARY. STATES EXISTING RAINY DAY FUND. FOUR YEARS AGO IN TWENTY FOURTEEN VOTERS OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVED PROPOSITION TWO A MEASURE WHICH STRENGTHEN THE STATE'S EXISTING BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT. BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE STATE CAN SAVE. WHEN THE ECONOMY AND REVENUES ARE HEALTHY. I JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED FULLY FUNDING THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT TO ITS CONSTITUTIONAL CAP OF THIRTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. COURSE WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL TO SAY WELL TIMES ARE GOOD. HOWEVER AS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S RECENTLY POINTED OUT FILLING THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT TO ITS CONSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY. COUNTER INTUITIVELY MAKES PREPARING FOR RECESSION MORE DIFFICULT IN FUTURE YEARS. EVEN WHEN FULLY FUNDED THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT IS LITTLE MORE THAN HALF OF WHAT CALIFORNIA WOULD NEED. TO INDOOR A MILD RECESSION. THE LTO BELIEVES THE STATE WILL ACTUALLY NEED TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN SAVINGS TO BATTLE A MILD RECESSION OR FORTY BILLION IN SAVINGS TO BATTLE A MODERATE RECESSION. ESTABLISHING AN ADDITIONAL RESERVE IS A LONG TERM REFORM THAT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS ARE NOT SADDLED WITH OUR DEBT OR FORCED TO MAKE SEVERE CUTS. TO EDUCATION AND OTHER IMPORTANT PROGRAMS. WITH ME TODAY ARE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS IRWIN AND GRAYSON. WHO WERE AMONG THE NINE JOINT AUTHORS OF THE BILL WHICH WE INTRODUCED LAST MONTH TO STIMULATE THIS DISCUSSION? THANK YOU SIR ONE AND LET THE RECORD REFLECT THAT MISTER BROTHERS JOINED US. I'M A PLEASED TO BE HERE WITH A THREE OF OUR JOINT AUTHORS TO TALK ABOUT AB SEVENTEEN FORTY THIS BILL REFLECTS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITIES OF THAT LEGISLATURE ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA HAS ADEQUATE RESERVES TO PROTECT CRITICAL SERVICES DURING RECESSIONS. CALIFORNIA'S REVENUES FLUCTUATE IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY. AND STOCK MARKET MUCH MORE THAN OTHER STATES LEADING TO DOWNTURNS THAT ARE REFERRED TO AS BUDGET PROBLEMS. BUDGET PROBLEMS AT THE STATE LEVEL MEAN REAL LOSSES TO OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION AND HEALTHCARE AMONG OTHER THINGS. AB SEVENTEEN FORTY CREATES A PATHWAY TO PROTECTING CALIFORNIANS IN LESS PROSPEROUS TIMES. GRAYSON. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THIS MEASURE PROPOSES A SIMPLE MECHANISM TO SAVE BEYOND THE RAINY DAY FUND WHILE WE CONTINUE TO ENJOY BUDGET SURPLUSES. NOBODY IN THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO BE IN THE SITUATION WHERE WE ARE CHOOSING BETWEEN ESSENTIAL SERVICES. LIKE EDUCATION HEALTHCARE SUPPORT FOR SENIORS AND PUBLIC SAFETY. YET CUTS ARE COMING AND EVEN WITH THE RAINY DAY FUND IT IS NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO FULLY INSULATE US FROM OUR REOCCURRING BOOM AND BUST CYCLES. AS MY COLLEAGUE HAS ALREADY POINTED OUT AND COLLEAGUES BOTH THE LA ILL RECENTLY SAID THAT WE WILL NEED AT LEAST TWENTY BILLION TO PREP DEL PROTECT. US AGAINST A MILD RECESSION YET THE THIRTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION PROPOSED WE WILL STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO. AFTER YEARS OF HISTORIC GROWTH WE ALL KNOW REVENUES WILL DROP AGAIN IT'S AN ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY WITH THIS BILL WE SIMPLY ASK THAT YOU HELP OUR CONSTITUENTS OUR FUTURE LEGISLATORS. BY DOING A FIST OF FISCAL FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE THING. AND THAT'S PUTTING MORE BACK AND WE THINK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS EFFORTS IS. LL. FINANCE. NEITHER HART. DEPARTMENT FINANCE NOT WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZE THE INTENT OF THIS LANGUAGE TO BUILD A MORE ROBUST RESERVE TO ADDRESS FUTURE RECESSION NEEDS WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL. AS IT APPEARS TO CIRCUMVENT THE VOTER'S INTENT TO SPEND THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS ABOVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT MAXIMUM ONE IF STRUCTURE PROGRAMS. BUT YOU. ANY FROM THE COMMITTEE DOCTOR CHOI. YEAH SURE HER THEN EMAIL OPPOSE HIS SET AND THAT WE DO HAVE A MECHANISM. TWO YOU WOULD LAST A EXISTING SPECIAL FUND UP FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AYE ACCOUNT DON'T. WHY IS IT NECESSARY IT DOESN'T CREATE THAT ANY ANY ERA? A BUT FANTASIA FOR HAVING JUST PERCENT OF TALENT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. THE ADDITIONAL ACCOUNT WILL GIVE. THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR MORE FLEXIBILITY. IN FUTURE YEARS. ESPECIALLY IF REVENUES CONTINUE TO. THE RECEIVE AT THE LEVELS THEY ARE ARE NOW OCCURRING. THE LA SHOW DID A VERY NICE ANALYSIS. WHICH IN LAYMAN'S TERMS SAYS THAT THAT THAT. A FALSE CHOICE HAS BEEN CREATED. IF THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR WANT TO PUT MORE MONEY IN RESERVE UNDER THE CURRENT STRUCTURE. WE CANNOT THIS WILL ALLOW US TO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL RESERVE. SO WHAT WHAT WAS THE. REQUIREMENT THAT WHY IT CAN'T THE WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE AT THE SUDDEN PUSH NHL. EXCEEDS OUT THAT THE SPURS HANDLE CAO TO RAINY DAY. AND THEN THE US SALES TAX I HAS TO BE UP. OF REDUCED OR IS THAT A NICE THING NAM TO REFUND AND DON'T KNOW WHAT THE. SADDEST TAXA รณ TO OUR TAXPAYERS WITH THE GOAL HERE IS TO IS CREATE THE. POSSIBILITY OF AN ADDITIONAL RESERVE. THERE'S NOTHING THAT THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS PROPOSAL THAT REQUIRES THAT ADDITIONAL RESERVE. TO BE. SOME OF THE BUDGET MONIES BE ALLOCATED TO IT BUT IT DOES GIVE UP THE PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY. THE OPTION. CHOICE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR SHOULD WE. OF THE DECIDE TO PURSUE IT. AYE I GET SOME IDEA TO RIGHT NOW WE CANCER RIGHT NOW IF WE WANT TO PUT MORE MONEY IN RESERVES WE CANNOT. A I I GUESS. MY SIMPER INTERPRETATION OR BE OUT. WHEN. WE HAVE OUR ACCESS AS SUCH SURPLUS A SURPLUS OF NASA NICE TO SAY THAT UNLESS UP WITH THAT THE MONEY ASIDE DOES NOT FOR WHAT RAINY DAY A. AND WE CAN USE THAT THE BUT THE WHEN. ARE. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A SURPLUS IS OUT AND ATTACKED ME AND. OUT WE ARE ASSESSING EXCESSIVE TAX TO OUR CITIZENS PIE. SO AT THE SUDDEN ARE PUT A THRUSH OR JUST OVER THEN WE SHOULD STOP THAT AND THE MAYBE OF REDUCED US YOU KNOW TAX. WHAT WAS CITIZENS US SO FAR SAID WE HAVE COLLECTED THAT THE MONEY OUT ESCAPE IT? AND A CONTINUE TO TAX MORE. REGARDLESS SO FAR. YET EXIST AMOUNT. THAT THE REVENUE AND A SOAP SO PRODUCES SURPLUSES TO WE GENERATE. I THINK THERE IS THIS IS ALLOWING THAT TO STE POLICY DISCUSSION OF WHAT ACTUALLY A OF REASONABLE AND RESPONSIBLE RESERVE IS. THE BUDGET WAS CLOSE TO TWO HUNDRED. BILLION DOLLARS AND THIS IS LESS THAN TEN PERCENT OF THAT. SO IT ALLOWS THE FLEXIBILITY OF. THAT THAT POLICY DISCUSSION TO SAVE TEN PERCENT TO TO SOME OF THE CITIES THINK THAT FIFTEEN PERCENT IS RESPONSIBLE. RIGHT NOW WE'RE STUCK AT THE LEVEL THAT. WAS. PROP TO PASS. OKAY AT EL LA OR MAYBE I YOU CAN EXPLAIN NOT. WHEN WE HAVE A TWO HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR YOU KNOW. IT IS AT THE TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS UP TO ONE TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS SEXIST SO WHAT AMOUNT IS OUR IDEA. OF WHAT THE KIND OF. RECESSION ARE WE ANTICIPATING IT FOR. A RECESSION HIT SO WELL WHAT WILL CUT ABOVE BUDGET THAT ARE WE ANTICIPATING THAT'S THE SHORT THAT WE. NEED THIS EXTRA FUND. ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WE HAVE A SO FAR OF CUMULATED. I ANALYSTS ALEJO. WE DID ANALYSIS RECENTLY WHERE WE LOOKED AT YOU KNOW DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RESERVES THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED. IF LEGISLATURE WANTED TO WHETHER DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RECESSIONS. SO YOU KNOW THE SHORT ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS THERE'S NO RIGHT LEVEL OF PREPARATION THERE'S NO SORT OF MAGIC NUMBER IT DEPENDS. A LOT ON. THE LEGISLATURE'S ASSESSMENT OF HOW BIG THE NEXT RECESSION WOULD BE. AND HOW MUCH THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE WILLING TO MAKE PROGRAMMATIC CUTS ARE REYES PA REVENUES DURING A RECESSION VERSES I WANTING TO RELY SIMPLY ON RESERVES BUT WHAT WE FOUND. IS THAT. TO WHETHER A MILD RECESSION THE LEGISLATURE WOULD MEAN ABOUT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS FROM MODERATE RECESSION IT WOULD NEED ABOUT FORTY BILLION DOLLARS. AND FOR A MORE SEVERE RECESSION LIKE THE ONE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IT WOULD NEED MUCH MORE THAN FORTY. MISTER OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON DOCTOR CHOICE QUESTION BECAUSE. WE'VE GOT TO RESERVE ACCOUNTS NOW WE GOT THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT AND YOU ARE CORRECT WE CANNOT PUT MORE THAN TEN PERCENT OF STATE REVENUES IN THAT ACCOUNT AND THAT WE ARE PROPOSING TO FULLY FUND AT THIS YEAR. BUT WE ALSO HAVE A SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WHICH DOES NOT HAVE A CAP ON IT SO THE QUESTION IS WHY I AND I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NEED TO HAVE MORE RESERVES AND I THINK WE DO NEED TO HAVE MORE RESEARCH I THINK IT'S. VERY CLEAR BUT I QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT YOU NEED TO HAVE A THIRD TYPE OF ACCOUNT BECAUSE THE US AT THE U. DOES NOT HAVE A. A CAP SO WHY NOT JUST PUT THE MONEY IN THE US HAVE YOU. AND THAT'S NOT HOW HOW I READ. THAT'S THE SUBJECT. AS LAID OUT BY THE LA YOU KNOW MAYBE THE LA O. CAN HELP US WITH THAT QUESTION. AND YET SO THERE'S. AS YOU SAID THERE IS TO. TO RESERVE THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT OF A SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT HAS A LIMIT OF ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES. THE SFU DOES NOT HAVE A LIMIT AT HIGHS. TO STATUTORY SALES TAX TRIGGERS. THAT WOULD REDUCE THE BALANCE OUT OF THE AS IF YOU BY ABOUT% ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IF EITHER OF THEM ARE TRIGGERED. THEY WOULD BE TRIGGERED IN THE CASE OF THE ON EITHER THE RESERVE REACHING ON ABOUT FOUR PERCENT OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES OVER THE COURSE OF TWO FISCAL YEARS OR THREE PERCENT OF GENERAL FUND REVENUES. AS WELL AS A DETERMINATION BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT. THE BUDGET. ESSENTIALLY THAT RESERVES HAD GROWN UP BETWEEN MAY AND SEPTEMBER SO I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THOSE PROVISIONS SO IF I CAN RESTATE. I'D. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CREATING A THIRD TYPE OF RESERVE ACCOUNT SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO CUT THE SALES TAX RATE BY A QUARTER PERCENTAGE IS THAT FAIR. I WOULD SAY IT GIVES THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR CHOICES. IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY ANTICIPATE THAT IT SIMPLY GIVES THE WHAT GIVES US FLEXIBILITY AND GIVES US CHOICES. OKAY I MEAN I JUST. I WOULD DARE TO RESIDENTS A FALSE CHOICE THE CURRENT SYSTEM THAT. CREATES A SERIES A FALSE CHOICES. I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE MORE CHOICES. ALRIGHT REFER ENOUGH YOU YOU KNOW I I I THINK WE ARE UNIFIED IN OUR DESIRE TO SAVE MORE MONEY BECAUSE WE ALL AGREE WITH THE LA THOUGH THAT A TEN PERCENT RESERVE IS NOT ENOUGH. HOWEVER. WHEN THE SFU WAS CREATED THIS STATUTORY SALES TAX CUT WAS I PUT HIM BECAUSE. OUT OF RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT. IF WE HAVE A IN A HEALTHY RESERVE THEN MAYBE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE TAXED A LITTLE LESS. AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S ON A REASONABLE CHOICE AND THE ENABLING. LANGUAGE IN THE SMB YOU SAYS THAT IF THE RESERVE ACCOUNT BALANCE WHEREVER TO DROP BELOW. A FOUR PERCENT OF THEM THE OUGHT THIS QUARTER CENT SALES TAX WOULD AUTOMATICALLY BE REINSTATED. SO THAT TO ME THAT SEEMS LIKE A REALLY REASONABLE PROPOSITION AND I WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME EXPLAINING TO MY CONSTITUENTS WHY THEY DON'T DESERVE TO PAY A LITTLE BIT LESS IN TAX USELESS. NEXT YEAR BECAUSE WE'RE TAKING AND SO MUCH REVENUES THAT'S THAT'S MY CONCERN WITH WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE. HILL AYE I THINK KIDDO. BY AGREE WITH THE SPIRIT OF YOUR STATEMENT I THINK CHOICES ARE. A SHOULD BE BROADER AND MORE VARIED THAN. DAN. AS YOU LAID THEM OUT I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT I DO HAVE A CO AUTHORS I SAID I AND IT'S ACTUALLY WE. THE WHO SUPPORT THIS. ALRIGHT WELL THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWER THE QUESTION. MR BROKE. IF WE WERE MOTION ALL SECOND THAT. OR THINK YOU OFFER TO BRING THIS FORWARD NUMBER ONE ONSLAUGHT OF MATTER. WELL HEATHER IF WHILE THE DESERT SESSIONS MATTER WHEN YOU KNOW FROM LAST TIME. NUMBER PROGRAMS NEVER FULLY FUNDED TO THEIR EXTENT PARTLY RECESSIONS I THINK'S IMPORTANT IS TIMELY. AND IT HELPS YOU CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH IN A RAINY DAY FUND. ONLY GOOD OPEN TO PUBLIC COMMENT YOU WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM. CAL CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT. THE CHAIRS ARE CONDITIONAL THIS IS TO ADOPT POLLS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE FOR THE MOTION CLEAN OF LOCAL POLICE. COOPER I BROKE. CABALLERO. CHIU. CHOI. MOST BETH THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THINK TERRACE ARE WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE AS A CANVAS REGULATION IMPLEMENTATION ENFORCEMENT. A RESTORED MEMBERS TESTIMONY FIRST. BUT THE DOCTOR WOODS HERE. MORE PEOPLE. WE COULD HAVE IT WITH A VERY LONG AGENDA. SO HOW ABOUT YOU COME UP AND. THEY'LL GO GET HIM AGAIN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR THANK YOU FOR PATIENTS ARE SIR. START BY THANKING MISTER LACKEY WAS IN HERE BUT I WAS GONNA FOLLOW HIS TESTIMONY. SO REGARDING THE CANNABIS A ENFORCEMENT FUNDING AS YOU KNOW THIS IS AN INDUSTRY IS CRITICAL TO THE ECONOMY OF MY DISTRICT. THE COMPREHENSIVE STATE A SET OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE OF THE ADMINISTRATION THE VOTERS HAVE CREATED FOR THIS INDUSTRY. FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS TO DESIGN TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC'S HEALTH AND SAFETY AS WELL AS UPHOLD STRONG ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS WE ARE PROUD OF IN THE STATE. BUT THIS IS SIMPLY WITH WE HAVE CREATED IS ALSO EXCEPTIONAL EXPENSIVE AND DIFFICULT FOR BUSINESS OWNERS TRYING TO ENTER THE MARKET TO NAVIGATE. WHO WANT BUSINESSES TO COMPLY WE HAVE TO MAKE IT FAIR AND REASONABLE? BUT NOW THE HIGH COST OF COMPLIANCE AND RELATIVELY LITTLE ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST UNCOMMITTED BUSINESSES IS MAKING IS CREATING A PERVERSE INCENTIVE TO STAY OUT OF THE REGULATED MARKET WHICH OF COURSE IS NOT WE HOPE OR INTENDED. WE DON'T CHANGE THAT DYNAMIC WE WILL NEVER HAVE THE HEALTHY REGULATED INDUSTRY THE VOTERS CHOSE TO CREATE. CONTINUE TO COME UP WITH WOEFULLY SHORT A WILL COME UP WOEFULLY SHORT IN THE TAX REVENUE THE VOTERS WERE PROMISED. THIS IS NOT ABOUT LOCKING PEOPLE UP FOR TAKING DOWN THE A OR OR TAKING DOWN THE COURT CARTELS AS MR LACKEY WILL SAY. THIS PROGRAM WAS CREATED BY PROP SIXTY FOUR BUT WON'T BE FUNDED DUE TO A LACK OF. TO LACKLUSTER TAX REVENUE THIS YEAR. THE DOLLARS FOCUS OF THE OF FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE CREATED A PATHWAY TO COMPLIANCE WITH A CANDIDATE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. NEED HELP ENSURING THAT BAD ACTORS ARE NOT SUCCESSFULLY AND UNDERCUTTING LICENSE BUSINESSES WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE. THERE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED LICENSE CANNABIS FARMS IN HUMBLE COUNTY BUT THE SHERIFF IN MY DISTRICT ESTIMATES ARE THIRTEEN THOUSAND AND PERMITTED GROWS IN HUMBLE COUNTY ALONE. HE ONLY HAS FIVE DEPUTIES TO ENFORCE THE LAW. WITHOUT HELP LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WILL CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE TO ELIMINATE UNLICENSED BUSINESSES THE PUBLIC WILL NOT BE PROTECTED THE UNREGULATED PARK MARKET WILL FLOURISH AND LICENSE BUSINESSES WILL SUFFER.

THE CANDIDATES HAVE PACKAGE THERE'S MANY DEPARTMENT REPRESENTATIVES IN THE AUDIENCE TODAY. SO AFTER THE PRESENTATION IF YOU HAVE MORE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS I HAVE THEM JOIN ME AT THE TABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE THANK YOU. AND SO NAY REVISION INCLUDES A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS I RELATED IT TO CANNABIS RELATED PROPOSALS. THERE'S TWO MAIN FUNDING SOURCES THE CANNABIS CONTROL FIND WHICH RECEIVES ITS REVENUES THROUGH A REGULATORY FEES AND THE CANNABIS TAX FUND WHICH RECEIVES MONEY THROUGH AN EXCISE AND CULTIVATION TAX ON CANNABIS. TOTAL EXPENDITURES FROM THE CONTROL FINER EXPECTED TO BE HUNDRED FORTY SIX MILLION AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND SIXTY SEVEN MILLION FROM THE CANNABIS TAX FUND. GIVEN THAT WERE IN THE EARLY IMPLEMENTATION STAGES OF PROP SIXTY FOUR. ALL THE NON STATUTORY LEE. SPECIFY DOLLAR AMOUNTS WERE PROPOSING TO FUND ON A TWO YEAR LIMIT TERM ASIS SO WE CAN COME BACK IN THE FUTURE WITH MORE INFORMATION. AND JUSTIFY ONGOING RESOURCES FOR THESE ACTIVITIES. AND NOW TO GET INTO THE REVENUES HERE. THINK WE ESTIMATED THAT CAMPUS TAX REVENUE TO BE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE MILLION SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN AND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION. AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. THOSE ESTIMATES WERE COMPLETED BEFORE WE HAD OUR FIRST TIME. ACTUAL TAX PAYMENT WHICH IS ABOUT THIRTY FOUR MILLION AT THE END OF APRIL AND THAT NUMBER ON THE SURFACE SUGGESTS THAT TAX REVENUES WILL COMMENCE LATELY. A SLOWER THAN ANTICIPATED. AND ARE CANNABIS CONTROL FUND REVENUES ARE ESTIMATED AT ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY MILLION IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. HOWEVER WE ARE CONCERNED IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE FISCAL YEAR THAT THERE MIGHT NOT BE CASH AVAILABLE SO WE'RE PROPOSING A FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND LOAN. THAT WILL BE REPAID IN NINETEEN TWENTY FROM THE CANNABIS TAX ON. AND TO DATE WE HAVE ACTUALLY ISSUED A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND LOANS TO FUND CANNABIS ACTIVITY THAT'S TAKEN PLACE WHILE REVENUES HAVEN'T BEEN AVAILABLE. THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE REPAID IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FROM THE CANNABIS TAX ON. NOW THAT GIVEN KIND OF A HIGHER LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE EXPENDITURES AND. REVENUES ARE GET INTO SOME MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT'S. SO THE THREE MAIN LICENSING ENTITIES THAT EUROPE CANNABIS CONTROL CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC MEN OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THEIR PROPOSALS MAINLY INCLUDE RESOURCES RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF S. B. NINETY FOUR. THAT INCLUDES RESOURCES FOR LOCAL LIAISON USE IT UNITS TO HELP WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORIZATION PROCESS. VARYING LEVELS OF RESOURCES RELATED TO THE NORTH COAST OFFICE THAT'S REQUIRED TO BE ESTABLISHED IN STATUTE.

SOME UNIQUE COMPONENTS OF THEIR PROPOSALS THAT BE YOUR OF CANNABIS CONTROL INCLUDES ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FOR QUALITY ASSURNCE. MONITORING TEAMS ARE ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED IN SP NINETY FOUR. AND ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. THAT AND HAS TWO FULL APPROACH FIRST TO EXPLAIN TO THOSE NOT IN THE REGULATED MARKET THE BENEFITS OF BEING IN IT. AND SECOND TO EXPLAIN TO CONSUMERS THE BENEFIT OF PERSIAN SING CANNABIS THROUGH THE REGULATED MARKET. THE PART OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE'S BUDGET INCLUDES OUR PROPOSAL INCLUDES ABOUT SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS HER DEVELOPMENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THE APPELLATIONS INCOMPATIBLE ORGANICS PER. PROGRAM THAT WAS INCLUDED IN S. B. NINETY FOUR AND TWO POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS REALLY TO SEE QUITE RELATED WORKLOAD IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND FIELD WORK. THERE SIX POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CAT TAXI AGENCIES MAINLY RELATED TO CASH COLLECTION OF TAXES THAT INCLUDES THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT. OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION AND. EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AND FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR SECRETARY OF STATE RELATED TO CANNABIS AND BUSINESS FILINGS AND TRADEMARK WORKLOAD THAT'S INCREASE IN JANUARY. THERE'S ALSO ABOUT TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS SPREAD ACROSS THEM THREE MAIN LICENSING ENTITIES TO PAY OF THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS ON FOR APPEALS OF LICENSE DENIALS ENFORCEMENT ACTION AND DISCIPLINE CASES. THERE'S ALSO ABOUT ONE POINT FOUR MILLION FOR THE CANNABIS CONTROLS APPEALS APPEALS PANEL I RELATED TO THEIR TWO NEW MEMBERS THAT WERE PROVIDED THAT'S BEEN NINETY FOUR SOME ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. AND THEN ATTORNEY POSITION. THERE'S THAT THE SECOND COMPONENT IS SORT OF PRIORITY TO PROGRAMS THAT WERE CALLING ON THEIR STATUTORILY SPECIFIED IN AT HIGH PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR TO BE PAID. A TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR GOBIZ TO TO PROVIDE A GRANT PROGRAM TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS.

DUE TO HOW PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR WERE STRUCTURED IN THE FUNDING COMPONENT OF THE PRIORITY THREE PROGRAMS WON'T RECEIVE FUNDING INTO NINETEEN TWENTY. I WANT OTHER COMPONENT AS WE HAVE TRAILER BILL RAILING WHICH I RELATED TO THE FBI BACKGROUND CHECKS. FOR CDF A IN CDP H.. SPRITE THE MILLIONS HERE WE BROUGHT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AT THE END OF FEBRUARY EARLY MARCH TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE WHERE THE FBI DOESN'T THINK WE HAVE. A SUFFICIENT STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION FOR THEM TO RECEIVE THAT INFORMATION. WE'VE ACTUALLY. HAVE THAT HAVE DIRECT FEEDBACK FROM THE FBI NOW AND WE'RE PROPOSING TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES IN THE HOPES THAT THEY'LL. AUTHORIZED THE DEPARTMENTS RECEIVING THAT INFORMATION BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR IN THE END TERM WE ARE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD TO TO BE OF THE ISSUE ANYA LICENSES WITH THE ACTUAL. CAN IN TURN PROCESS WHERE WE ONLY DO CALIFORNIA ONLY BACKGROUND CHECKS. THAT INFORMATION WILL THEN ONCE WE HAVE THE FEDERAL BACKGROUND CHECKS WILL BE RUN FINGERPRINTS TO CHECK ON THOSE LICENSEES. SO. I THAT CONCLUDES THAT MY COMMENTS TODAY THANK YOU OKAY I'M A PAUSE AND THINK TESTIMONY FROM US MOVEMENT LACKEY. THANK YOU CHAIR. AND MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO SPEAK TO THIS ISSUE. CENTRO LEGAL BUT DON'T USE SALES BEGAN IN JANUARY. IT'S BECOME QUITE APPARENT THAT UNLICENSED CANNABIS ACTIVITY IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM AROUND THE STATE. AS LONG AS I'M LICENSE ACTIVITY IS ALLOWED TO PROMOTE PROLIFERATE. IT WILL UNDERCUT THE LEGAL MARKET THE PROP SIXTY FOUR SET UP. IN ORDER TO COMBAT THIS CALIFORNIA MUST PROVIDE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AGAINST ILLICIT MARKET UTILIZING LOCAL PARTNERS. PROP SIXTY FOUR STAB WISH. AN ARCHITECTURE FOR CANNABIS TAX REVENUE TO FUND GRANTS TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF LEGAL CANNABIS. HOWEVER THIS FUNDING IS NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED INTEL TWENTY NINETEEN OR TWENTY TWENTY. IN LIGHT OF THE THE TIME SENSITIVE NEED TO SUPPRESS THE ILLICIT MARKET. IT'S REQUESTED THAT THE STATE PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR THAT EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET TO FUND THESE GRANTS. I REQUEST IS FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION IN GRANTS ADMINISTERED BY THE BOARD. STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS WITH THE REQUIRED TWENTY FIVE PERCENT MATCH FROM THE LOCAL FUNDS. TO CONDUCT OF FORSMAN AGAINST ILLEGAL OPERATORS. THIS WILL BE RESTRICTED TO JURISDICTIONS THAT LICENSE RETAIL CULTIVATION A SPECIFIED PROP SIXTY FOUR. THESE GRANTS WOULD SERVICE SEED MONEY FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ASSESS FINES AND PENALTIES FROM LICENSE ACTIVITY BUT COLLECTING THE MONEY FROM THESE TAKES TIME. THESE GRANTS WOULD ALLOW LOCALS TO GET THEIR ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM SET UP WITH THE GOAL OF. USING COLLECTED FINES AND PENALTIES TO FUND FUTURE ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS. WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE BUDGET STAFF FOR A LOT OF THEIR HARD WORK. AND. YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS REQUEST I AM SO I ACTUALLY HAVE ONE RELEVANT COMMENT IN RELATION TO. THAT EFFORT NOT FROM MY PRESENTATION AS WE ARE. PROPOSING FOURTEEN MILLION FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO ESTABLISH FOR INVESTIGATIVE TEAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND ONE INTERDICTION TEAM. WILL BE FOCUSED ON MORE COMPLEX CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS AS IT RELATES TO FINANCIAL AND TAX EVASION INVESTIGATIONS AND CRIMINAL CRAP. AND I'VE COUPLE QUESTIONS CAN EXPLAIN WHY DEAL LEFT SIDE TO FLYNN DOJ ENFORCEMENT OF A PROP FIFTY FOUR MONEY. SO AND. I THINK AS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY POINTED OUT THERE DEFTLY WAS RECENT. RESOURCES CONTEMPLATED IN THE INITIATIVE FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. HOWEVER THOSE WON'T BECOME AVAILABLE TILL NINETEEN TWENTY. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE DECLARATIONS AND FINING IN THE INTENT THERE'S A LOT NO WAY AS IT RELATES TO GETTING RATTLED RID OF CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS PREVENTING ILLEGAL DIVERSION TO OTHER STATES. AND YET THERE WAS NO RESOURCES REALLY DEDICATED TO THOSE SOPHISTICATED CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS SO WE THOUGHT IT WAS REASONABLE TO FIND AT THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE RESOURCES FROM THE CANNABIS TAX FUND. SATYAJIT COMPONENTS OF THEIR FOR TASK FORCES. HOW DO YOU HOW THEY INTERACT WITH LOCAL THAT'S PLAYED IN THE BIG ISSUE WITH IN THE PAST? DOJ AND WHEN THEIR TASK FORCES WHETHER IT'S METHAMPHETAMINE TASSELS FORCES MARIJUANA TASK FORCES. DOJ'S WE SUPPLEMENT THE SMALLER COUNTIES BEER COUNTIES HAD THEIR OWN ADDICTION TEAM SO HOW'S IT GOING OVER TO THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR GOING AFTER THE HIGH LEVEL FOLKS. WELL SO WE ACTUALLY IN OUR TRAILER BILL SO. STATUTORILY REQUIRED THAT THE. INTERACT WITH LOCAL. WITH. LAW ENFORCEMENT STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING LOCALS AND I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFICS ON EXACTLY HOW THOSE. IN INTERACTIONS WILL TAKE PLACE BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE A BENEFICIAL RACE RELATIONSHIP WHERE THERE PROVIDING LEADS FROM THE STATE LEVEL AND THE LOCALS TO THEM SO THAT THEY CAN. IDENTIFY THE APPROPRIATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY TO AND TAKE ACTION AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY IN DEPARTMENT JUSTICE IS HERE TO SPEAK MORE ELOQUENTLY TO THAT BACK AND FORTH MULLIN TALKING MOST LOCALS THEY HAVE. FORCED FORCES IMPLICITLY THE FUNDING TO HELP WITH THEM THEY HAVE THE EXPERTISE THERE THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR SUCH QUITE SOMETIME. IF YOU. HEAD BEING HE'S BEEN GONE EXTINCT FOR. LIKE WHAT EIGHT YEARS NOW REGULAR CAME IN OFFICE STILL HAS BEEN NOTE DOJ KNOWN BUCOLIC ENFORCEMENT SO. IT ALWAYS TO STAND THEM UP IN TIME EGGMAN HIRED DIRECTS HIRINGS GONNA TAKE SOME TIME SO. WHAT'S IT WITH YOU MISTER SLICKER ON THAT. I THINK BECAUSE OF THOSE REASONS WE THOUGHT THEY ARE THE APPROPRIATE ENTITY LONG TERM TO SORT OF INVESTIGATE AND ENFORCE IN THIS AREA THAT'S THE REASON FOR. CHOOSING THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE UNDERSTANDING THAT ANY RESOURCES THAT WE TO ESTABLISH AT THE STATE LEVEL WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME RAIN BUT TIME TO BE READY TO ENFORCE THE LAW. I THINK YOU'RE SORT OF COMPARING THAT TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT MAYBE ART HAVE RESOURCES IN PLACE. BUT. AGAIN BECAUSE THE INITIATIVE ALREADY CONTEMPLATED FUNDING FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. READ IT WELL IN A CIRCUMVENT THAT. SO. CHAIRMAN HAD THIS IS CHRIS RYAN DEPARTMENT JUSTICE THROUGH LISTENING TO THE COMMENTS AND WE UNDERSTAND IT QUESTIONS. AND. IT SIMILAR TO THE STRUCTURE THAT YOU DESCRIBE BEFORE HIM EARLIER YEARS. WE HAD APPROACHED ME SEVEN ONE MILLION DOLLARS AND. IN RESOURCES AVAILABLE. TO WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT BUT IS THAT FINANCE DESCRIBED. WE ARE GONNA BE REESTABLISHING FOUR TEAMS. AND REDEPLOYING THOSE RESOURCES AND TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES. COVERED IN THIS PROPOSITION BUT WHAT MY CONCERN IS RIGHT NOW YOU CAN DO THAT GAMING. YOU'RE BEHIND THAT TWO THOUSAND INVESTIGATIONS IN GAMING SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS. IF YOU GUYS CAN'T. KEEP UP WITH THE GAMING THERE'S OBVIOUSLY IS WHEN THEY'RE FOR GAMING HOW DO YOU PLAN ON KEEPING UP. WITH THE CANNABIS ISSUE. SO. GREAT QUESTION AND AND AND WE ARE HIRING A TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES IN THE GAMING WE ARE WORKING WITH THE INDUSTRY. TO ADDRESS THOSE GAMBLING ISSUES. WE'RE TAKING A LOOK AT THE WORKLOAD AND MARK A CLOSER LOOK AT THE WORKLOAD AND ADDRESSING THE ISSUES HAS ARE COMING OUT SO BILLS COMMITTEE THIS IN MY FOURTH YEAR IN ASSEMBLY NOW. IN THAT. WORKLOAD IS STILL BEEN THERE THE ENTIRE TIME SO I HAVE A LOT OF CONFERENCE THAT DOJ'S GONNA BE ABLE TO. TRANSLATE THAT INTO THE SAME WITH BEING THE ONE WHO ACTUALLY STANDING SOMEBODY IT WAS A BIG ISSUE RIGHT NOW. AND IN OF LOCALS HAVE SOME CONCERNS TO. WILL THE MONEY TRICKLE DOWN AND AND WILL THE EFFECT BE WITH THAT SO. THE IN JUST IN TIME FROM THE LITTLE BIT LEERY ON THAT POINT. AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONCERNED. AND AND YOU MENTIONED THAT THIS IS A AN ISSUE THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR SOMETIME. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THE NEW ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING A NEW LOOK AT THIS AND FOCUSING ON THE THE ISSUES THATYOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WITH THE INDUSTRY. ANNA A CONCERTED EFFORT IS BEING PUT FORWARD TO DEPLOY THOSE RESOURCES SOUND ELSE IN THE PLAYOFFS TUNING UP THOSE TASK FORCES. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CANNABIS TASK FORCES YES SO AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN WILL GO INTO. HIRING AGENTS. AND ADDRESSING THE ISSUES AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN BASED UPON WITH RECRUITMENT RETENTION THE DOJ WE ARE AS THAT MANY STATE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES HAVE BUT YES AT DOJ WE HAVE STILL HAD SOME PROBLEMS ITH RECRUITING. MARTIN I LOVE COMES DOWN TO PAY THE PAY OBVIOUSLY THE LOCAL JURISDICTION. THE PAVE MUCH MORE LUCRATIVE THAN THE STATE. SAW THAT. IS GONNA CONTINUE TO BE A PROBLEM BUT. I'M NOT GONNA. BUT BEFORE THAT TO DESK CHAIR WITH A POINT OF CLARIFICATION I THINK YOU SAID THAT THE. PAY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OR STATE LEVEL AT THAT THAT THE LOCAL LEVELS RIGHT THE LOCAL LEVEL SEEMS TO BE BETTER FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT PAY ABSOLUTELY WE HAVE AN ISSUE AT THE STATE RECRUITING FOR STATE LAW ENFORCEMENT. LET'S THEY WHAT NOT AS DOJ RIGHT CARRILLO HERE. THANK YOU. LL. HOW INCREASING AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SO IN GENERAL WE THINK THAT THE PROPOSAL'S THIS YEAR DO YOU APPEAR REASONABLE AND BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY REVIEW? AYE WE DEFINE THEIR SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE LEVEL OF RESOURCES THAT WILL BE NEEDED ON AN ONGOING BASIS IN LARGE PART BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH A NEW PROGRAM THERE IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE GONNA NEED. AYE SO WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S COMING FORWARD WITH A PROPOSAL THAT'S FOR LIMITED TERM POSITIONS WE THINK THAT. IS VERY HELPFUL BECAUSE IN TWO YEARS WHEN THOSE. START EXPIRING. WE THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE ABLE TO REVISIT THE ONGOING FUNDING LEVELS AND MAKE SURE THAT I THEIR PROGRAM THE BENEFIT OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. SO I THINK THAT'S A. VERY VALUABLE THING I THINK THEY'RE JUST A COUPLE THINGS I WANTED TO FLY QUICKLY FOR YOU. ONE IS A THE APPROPRIATE USES OF PROP SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS I KNOW THERE'S. REFERENCE IN THAT AGENDA AYE TO THAT ISSUE YOU WITH REGARD TO DOJ. THE ISSUE WE'VE JUST BEEN DISCUSSING COMPROMISED FIGHT ANOTHER SMALLER ISSUE. WHICH IS RELATED TO THE AT TO A PIECE OF THREE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD FIND WORKFORCE RELATED ACTIVITIES CITIES ARE THINGS LIKE. I'M HOPING BUSINESSES TO. HIGHER FROM CANNABIS INDUSTRY. AND ALSO HELPING JOB SEEKERS TO TO FIND JOBS WITHIN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY. ARMS IT WASN'T CLEAR OUT TO US IF THAT'S ELIGIBLE UNDER THE PROP SIXTY FOUR WHICH LIMITS THOSE. EDT FUNDS TO APPLYING IN ENFORCING STATE LABOR LAWS SO WE JUST WANTED TO FIGHT THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT COULD BE. FOLLOWED UP ON I'M AND THEN THE SECOND ISSUE WHEN IT'S A FIGHT FOR THE COMMITTEE IS RELATED TO THAT DEPARTMENT ATTACKS IN FEET MINISTRATION. SO WE DO THINK IT'S REASONABLE FOR THEM TO GET ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES THAT. THAT THEY WILL BE UNDERTAKING I'M THERE'S ONE PIECE THAT WE. WE WANTED TO KIND OF FLAG AND THAT PEACE IS RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS I'M SO THE TRAILER BILL FROM LAST YEAR DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF TAX PAYERS THAT DON'T HAVE TO HANDLE. BECAUSE OF THE WAY THAT IT. HAS DISTRIBUTORS DOING TAX COLLECTIONS OF TICKET FROM BELOW TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OF ENTITIES PAYING THESE TAXES TO PROVIDE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED. SO THERE WAS A SOME AYE SOME WHATEVER REDUCTION THAT'S REFLECTED IN THEIR MEN THEIR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL A HUNDRED THOUSAND AND WE THINK THAT PROBABLY A ABOUT AN ADDITIONAL FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND REDUCTION WOULD BE APPROPRIATE THERE. THERE IT'S A GIVEN THAT AUGMENTATION IT WOULD JUST BE OF A TWO POINT ONE MILLION RATHER THAN TWO POINT FIVE MILLION. SO THAT WAS THE SECOND ISSUE IS WANTED TO FIGHT FOR FOLKS. HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS IF IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE. GO ON UP PUBLIC COMMENT WAS ITEM YOU WISH TO SPEAK. SURE MEMBERS RAN MARTIN REPRESENT KHALIFA OUT OF SAN JOSE AND BLACK WERE LOGISTICS BOTH OF WHICH ARE. A. COMPLIANT LICENSED. PROVIDERS OF THE SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA I'M WE SUPPORT THE FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DOJ I'M APPROPRIATION AS WELL AS THE INCREASED APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE THREE REGULATORY BODIES. DESPITE THE THOUGH BUT THE. REPORTS EARLY ON THIS YEAR THAT IT'S GONNA BE A VERY ROBUST INDUSTRY IT HAS NOT TURNED OUT TO BE NEARLY AS ROBUST AS WE HAD HOPED. AND WE ATTRIBUTE A LARGE PART OF THAT TO THE FACT THAT THERE IS STILL A VERY HEALTHY ILLEGAL MARKET OUT THERE. AND WE HAVE STEPPED UP WE ARE COMPLIANT WE ARE LICENSED AND WE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. ALONG WITH THE OTHERS WHO ARE LICENSED I'M AND HOPE THAT WE CAN GET THE ILLEGAL MARKET OUT OF THE BUSINESS SO WE HAVE IT A BIT ABILITY TO TO GROW AND PROSPER AND HEALTH. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON FRIEND MURPHY WITH WE MAPS. STAND IN SUPPORT OF THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY I THINK THAT RESTRICTING THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION TO JUST AREAS THAT OUR LICENSING IS A GREAT IDEA. AND WHILE WE ALL KNOW THAT THE ILLEGAL MARKET IS IS A MASSIVE PROBLEM THE REALITY IS THE LEGAL MARKETS DONE IT IS THERE FOR TWO REASONS ONE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH LOCAL LICENSES. TO POSSIBLY DECREASE AT POINT. EXCUSE ME ONLY EIGHTY PERCENT EIGHTY PERCENT OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE NOT LICENSING RETAIL. IF YOU DON'T HAVE LEGAL ACCESS. CAN ELIMINATE THE LEGAL MARKET WON'T HAPPEN. HOWEVER STEPS IN. TAKING CRACK STEPS DO ENFORCEMENT AND HELP ENFORCEMENT IN AREAS THAT ARE LICENSING RETAIL IS A GREAT IDEA THANK YOU A QUESTION FOR YOU THOUGH USAGE LIMIT TO THE AREAS THAT OUR LICENSING. WELL HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY FOR INSTANCE NO WAY JURISDICTION HAS LICENSE THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO AS WE KNOW SACRAMENTO. PROPER IS NUMBER ONE FOR. BLACK MARKET LABS ARE SEIZURES OF CLANDESTINE AYE MARIJUANA GROWS CAMPUS GROWS INTO NUMBER ONE AND MOST OF THOSE ARE INCURRING. OUTSIDE OF THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO SWISHING THEY'LL GROW OVER A HUNDRED HOMES. NO PASSED TWO YEARS SO. NEWMAN HAS BEEN MONEY LOGISTICS THAT LICENSE MEANWHILE. NEVER JERSEYS THAT DON'T LICENSE. THE USER IF GOD REPETITIONS WITH GROW SO ATTY CORRELATE THE TOO. HOT SUIT THE. THE GENERAL NEXUS IN STATES THAT HAVE LEGALIZED IS THAT THERE'S THERE'S ESSENTIALLY TWO TWO WAYS TO ELIMINATE THE BLACK MARKET TO DECREASE IT. ONE IS THROUGH RETAIL ACCESS AND THE OTHER ONE AS A HEAVY ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM IN CONJUNCTION WITH RETAIL ACCESS. SO YOU HAVE TO EASE THE ANSWER TO THAT I THINK IS HOPEFULLY YOUR INCENTIVIZING ELK GROVE TO DO LEGITIMATE. WORK AND ACTUALLY. LICENSE THE BUSINESSES THE LEGAL BUSINESSES IN THEIR AREA SO ABOUT INCENTIVIZING WE MAPPED JUST TO USE. LEGITIMATE LICENSED DISTRIBUTORS. FOR DELIVERY. AND WE MET US DON'T DO DELIVERY SIR HELL NO OFFENSE. OUT OF STORY OKAY. OKAY. THAT ADVERTISE WITH THEM. THAT ON THE UPSIDE I TAKE THAT BACK ON THE ADVERTISING SO I GUESS THAT NOTHING GOOD COMMENT BUT IF WE COME TO COMPLIANCE WE TALK ABOUT COMPLIANCE HERE. IN READ MAPS SHOULD ALSO LET FOLKS THAT ARE LICENSED. FOR DELIVERY ON THEIR MAPS AND ALERTS YOU KNOW I'M SAYING. YOU GET IT MIGHT JUST RIGHT SWITCH ALL COMMITTEE COMPLIANCE THAT WOULD BE VERY NICE. SO THIS PINNACLES PUBLIC COMMENT. THERE'S NO FOOD QUESTIONS WITH GOV EUROPE I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION BUT I THINK. THAT ONE OF THE THE BIGGEST ISSUES IS HOW DO WE GET THE LOCAL. LAW ENFORCEMENT TO WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH THAT DOJ BECAUSE. IP WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO SHUT DOWN THAT THAT BLACK MARKET IF WE'RE GONNA REALLY SEE THE NUMBERS IMPROVE IN TERMS OF. OF. REVENUE COMING IN AND LICENSING LICENSES. BEING OBTAINED AND THE WHOLE ISSUE OF WHETHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE GOING TO ALLOW. A DISPENSARIES ARE NOT WE LEAVE UP TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO TO KIND OF WORK OUT I THINK ONCE THEY SEE THAT THERE'S A BENEFIT THEN THEY'LL COME ON BOARD I THINK SOME OF THEM WERE JUST REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT THE WHOLE THINKS BUT I. I REALLY WANT TO SUPPORT THE. THE IDEA THAT WE CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY TO FIND LOCAL AND FORCE ME TO DO SOME OF THE WORK AS WELL OR IT WILL COME DOWN TO WE'VE THIRTY THREE PERCENT OF CITIES THAT DO IT RIGHT NOW THEIR LICENSE SO. WHEN A POLICY OR SEVENTY SOME PERCENT I MEAN THIS. YOU GOT GOT A THREE RIDE TO THAT. JUST BECAUSE DON'T AGREE WITH THAT METHOD. SO. WE'RE RECOMMENDATION LA DOT THE MAYBE VISION PROPOSAL AMID THE DOJ PROPOSAL TO FUND IT FROM THE GENERAL FUND NOT PROP SIXTY FOUR. ADOPT TWENTY FINALLY FOR GRANTS TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND UP PLACEHOLDER TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. NOPE SORRY WE HAD TO FIND ALLOW ME TO THINK MY IDEAS CAN I'D SINCE IT'S. GENERAL FUND RESOURCES THAT DEVIATE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S FISCAL PLAN WE WOULD BE IN OPPOSITION AND I WILL BE HAPPY TO HEAR MORE DETAILS ON THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PIECE AND HOW THAT'S GONNA BE FUNDED BECAUSE THAT'LL BE IMPORTANT TO. WHAT POSITION WE TAKE DOING NOTED DR WOODS IT WAS AS WELL THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY ONCE AGAIN I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT? MY ISSUE IS AROUND CULTIVATION I REPRESENT AN AREA THAT MIGHT MY DISTRICT ABOUT SIXTY TO SEVENTY PERCENT PER HISTORICALLY OF CANNABIS CULTIVATION IS HAPPEN IN THAT DISTRICT. AND WHAT WAS WHAT WAS STRIKING TO ME AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THE REALLY OTHER THAN THE FIELD OFFICE WHICH WILL BE ESTABLISHING EUREKA THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY MONEY FOR ENFORCEMENT THERE. AND SO MY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HUMBLE COUNTY IN PARTICULAR. ONCE NEEDS THE RESOURCES ACTUALLY GO OUT AND FORCE AND THEY DON'T HAVE IT AND SO THAT WAS TO US THAT WAS A GLARING GLARING. OMISSION AND.

GENUINE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL TO ADDRESS NEAL AND INCREASE THE COUNTY WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH SP ONE SPD FOR PROFIT THE SIX AND PROP SIXTY FOUR. LL. ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING THAT ONE OF THESE THREE POSITIONS BE FUNDED SOLELY WITH GENERAL FUND ALTHOUGH THAT POSITION WILL BE PERFORMING STATEWIDE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS. ON TYPICALLY THESE POSITIONS WILL BE FUNDED WITH A MIX OF GENERAL FUND AND CENTRAL SERVICE COST RECOVERY FUND. AND WE THINK THAT THAT APPROPRIATE MAKE SHOULD BE USED IN THIS CASE AS WELL. THE QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. THEY WON THE PUBLIC WHICH IS BIG ON THIS ITEM. CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT RECOMMENDATION IS TO PROVE A MAJOR REVISION PROPOSAL THEIR MOTION. WELL THE FIRST AND SECOND ROLL CALL PLEASE COOPER AYE PRO. CABALLERO. CHIU. JOINT. CAN THIS ONE ISSUE NUMBER THREE A CALIFORNIA STATE PAYROLL SYSTEM. SEE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE REQUEST TO CONTINUE NINETEEN EXISTING RESOURCES AND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO SUPPORT THE CALIFORNIA STATE PAYROLL SYSTEM PROJECT IN STAGE TWO OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. PROJECT APPROVAL LIFE CYCLE. ELEVEN OF THE NINETEEN RESOURCES ARE REQUESTED AS PERMANENT. TO SUPPORT CORE PROJECT WORKED THROUGH THE DURATION OF THE CS PS PROJECT. THIS REQUEST ALSO INCLUDES FIVE NEW TO YOUR LIMITED TERM RESOURCES TO SUPPORT STATEWIDE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EMPLOYEE SELF SERVICE PORTAL WEB APPLICATION ALSO KNOWN AS CALIFORNIA EMPLOYEE CONNECT. FINANCE. WE SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL TO CONTINUE THAT REPLACEMENT EFFORT FOR THE PAYROLL SYSTEM INCLUDING THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF FEATURES AND STATEWIDE. SERVICE WEB PORTAL APPLICATION OIL. WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE PREVIOUS RESOURCES ON A TWO YEAR LIMITED TERM BASIS AND ADOPT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO BETTER ALIGN. THE PLANNING PROCESS FOR THIS. PAYROLL PROJECT WITH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THE LEGISLATURE HAS A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN WITH ITS OWN PRIORITIES FOR THIS IT PROJECT WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY BE. VERY COMPLEX AND COSTLY IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU FOR THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IF THESE ITEMS ARE APPROVED. HOW THIS PROCESS ALLOW FOR LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT MOVING FORWARD? YEAH SO WE RESPECT THE ELLIOTTS RECOMMENDATION ON THIS PROPOSAL. COVER WE DO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSIDER OUR REQUEST IS BUDGETED OUR PROPOSAL AS REQUESTED ALLOWS FOR ANNUAL REVIEW AND OVERSIGHT BY THE LEGISLATURE. THE CURRENT REQUEST DOES NOT INCLUDE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE PROJECT EVEN THROUGH THE COMPLETION OF STAGE TO. THEREFORE THE BEST YOU WILL BE BACK IN FRONT OF THIS COMMITTEE. AS EARLY AS NEXT SPRING TO REPORT ON THE PROGRESS OF THE PROJECT INTO SECURE RESOURCES TO COMPLETE A STAGE TO. THEREFORE WE BELIEVE IT IS UNNECESSARY TO LIMIT THE PERMANENT RESOURCE A PORTION OF THIS REQUEST WHICH WILL SUPPORT THE COR PROJECT. THROUGH THE DURATION OF THE PROJECT. IF ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE. THROW THINGS CHAIR. WOULD THE LEGISLATURE BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE SYSTEM. OF THE PAYROLL SYSTEM YES. OKAY BECAUSE ONE FRUSTRATION I HAVE THIS EVERY WEEK I GET A FRANK ENVELOPE FROM THE CONTROLLER WITH THAT PER DIEM PACE AT WHICH. I THINK IT'S HUGE WASTE PAPER ON HOW DOES THAT DOES EVERY STATE EMPLOYEE GET. HARPIST TUBS OF PAPER STUBS CURRENTLY. YES THEY DO. THAT WOULD BE THE SECOND PART OF THE CS PS REQUESTS WE HAVE A FIVE POSITION REQUEST TO CONTINUE THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ARC HELM PLAY CONNECT PORTAL. THE PORTAL ACTUALLY. WE HAVE A PROTOTYPE BUILT ITS IN PILOT INSIDE OF US CO RIGHT NOW AND IT DOES ALLOW FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF THE PRINTING OF THE DIRECT DEPOSIT ADVICES FOR ALL EMPLOYEES. INCLUDING CSU. BUT THE PLAN IS TO. OFFER THAT STATEWIDE SOMETIME IN TWENTY NINETEEN ONCE WE'RE DONE WITH OUR PILOT AND TESTING. OKAY SO THAT YOUR GOAL TO ULTIMATELY GET INTO A SYSTEM ROCKET LAGAAN IF I DON'T KNOW IF I GET A HOME LOAN I CAN PRINT OUT TWO MONTHS OF. PAY STUBS AYE DON'T NEED TO GET PAPER COPIES EVERY NOT THAT THIS IS YOUR GOAL DIRECTED YOU CAN ACTUALLY TO SAVE AN IMAGE OF IT. IF YOU EVER NEED TO. AND AGAIN THESE THINGS ARE THESE ARE THINGS WE WANT TO DO IN ADVANCE OF THE C. S. B. S. PROJECT THAT IS IN ANY TWENTY NEXT YEAR YOU'RE CONSIDERING DOING THIS WE'RE LOOKING AT TWENTY NINETEEN IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT SERVICE. IT'S GREAT NEWS THAT I ACTUALLY USE THAT SERVICE MY PURPLE EFFECT NO COUNTY YOU WAS THE FACT IF. EMPLOYEES GOING ON IN THE JUST GET THE PAPER HITS A SERIOUS. WE'VE SPEND APPROXIMATELY A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR RIGHT NOW PRUNING DIRECT DEPOSIT ADVICES AND ANOTHER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND A YEAR PUTTING W. TO. SELECT AND ASSIST REQUEST ON A LOT OF THIS IS A CONSIDERATION FOR. OUR CHANGING IMPROVING THAT PEER OR SYSTEM PER SE NOT THE INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE MONEY. CORRECT. CALVET A PUBLIC CONCERT YOU. AT FIRST I APPRECIATE MR PEROT'S QUESTION THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK ALL OF A SUDDEN WONDER ABOUT FOR AWHILE. SO THE LA IS RECOMMENDING THAT. WE REJECT THE ONGOING PROPOSAL IN PART SO THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON. FOR ALTERNATIVES TO THE PROJECT SO. BECAUSE I TRY TO READ THIS AND THERE'S A LOT OF BUREAUCRATIC LANGUAGE IN IT. HOW WE ACTUALLY TO HAVE INPUT INTO ALTERNATIVE IF YOU CAN JUST BEFORE WITH AN HONOR YOUR PROPOSED YEAH WE WE CANNOT MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PROJECT WITHOUT YOUR APPROVAL WE'VE WE? MUST COME BACK PRETTY MUCH EVERY YEAR TO REQUEST RESOURCES I'M ALREADY FORMING NEXT YEAR'S REQUEST. YOU WILL DEFINITELY HERE YOU KNOW STATUS UPDATES ONCE WE HAVE YOU KNOW MEANINGFUL NO INFORMATION REPORT. SO YEAH I HAVE EVERY YEAR YOU WILL HEAR FROM OUR OUR PROJECT CIVIL WITH ELIO SAY THAT. SO WE ALSO INCLUDED A RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY. THAT THE SCO WOULD COME BACK IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY I WITH THE RESULTS FROM STAGE TO ANALYSIS. AND WE DID THAT BECAUSE IMPART WE. THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE SCO TO COME BACK IN JANUARY SPECIFICALLY RATHER THAN MAY. AND ONE CONCERN THAT WE WOULD HAVE IS THAT THE REQUEST WOULD COME IN MAY IN THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE ONLY A FEW DAYS. OUGHT TO CONSIDER IT AND TO THINK OVER THESE VERY COMPLEX ALTERNATIVES BEFORE MAKING A DECISION WHICH IS A FEELS LIKE RIGHT NOW. OKAY. I HAVE SEEN TORRENT AYE I. THINK YOUR DEPARTMENT KNOWS MY GENERAL PERSPECTIVE ON A LOT OF THESE PROJECTS NOT SPECIFIC TO YOUR OFFICE BUT. NAM.

WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE RESOURCES REQUESTED HERE ON BUT THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO PROPOSES BUDGET THE LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW DO AFT TO AUGMENT AS CIOS ITEM. IF THERE ARE NEW FEATURES OF A SYSTEM OR ON SOMETHING ELSE THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO ADD TO THE CONTRACT WITH IBM WE THINK A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY MAKES SENSE BUT THAT THAT THERE SHOULD BE A CAP ON THE AMOUNT OF FLEXIBILITY THIS GIVEN TO DO YOU HAVE.

THE MODEST CHANGES REFLECTED IN THIS TWO BILLS CONSISTENT WITH THE EVOLUTION OF CD TEASE ROLE OF PROVIDING STATEWIDE STRATEGIC DIRECTION FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS. CBT HAS EXISTING STATUTORY AUTHORITY FOR OVERSIGHT PROCUREMENTS OF REPORTABLE IT PROJECTS PRIOR TO PROJECTS IMPLEMENTATION. BUT NOT DURING PROJECT MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS PHASE. DRESSED IN THE GPL REFLECT THE MODEST REALITY OF MODERN REALITY OF THE ENTIRE LIFECYCLE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS FROM CONCEPT.

AFTER A FEW YEARS AFTER WE HAD GOT GOTTEN SOME EXPERIENCE OPERATING UNDER THIS NEW SYSTEM. IN THAT SPIRIT. DEVIOUS COLLABORATED WITH CTT TO DEVELOP THE LANGUAGE THAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY. IT'S RELATIVELY MODEST CHANGE. TO EXISTING RULES RESPONSIBILITIES BUT ONE THAT STRENGTHENS A CD TEASE OVERSIGHT. CDT IS GETTING A LITTLE MORE AUTHORITY TO BE A CHECK AND BALANCE ON IT PROJECT RELATED ACQUISITIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY HANDLED BY CUSTOMER DEPARTMENTS. TO BE CLEAR HOWEVER DTS WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY OUT ITS EXISTING RESPONSIBILITIES. WHEN CUSTOMER AGENCIES CONDUCT ACQUISITIONS LATE IT PROJECTS WILL CONTINUE TO OPERATE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THEIR DELEGATIONS FROM TGS. DVS WILL CONTINUE TO SET LIMITS AND STATE CONTRACTING MANUAL PROCEDURES FOR THOSE ACQUISITIONS. I DID YES WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO WARD AND ADMINISTER ALL IT LEVERAGED PROCUREMENT AGREEMENTS. AND I ALSO WANT TO MAKE CLEAR THAT NOTHING IN THIS PROPOSAL CHANGES A COMPETITIVE BIDDING REQUIREMENTS THAT CURRENTLY APPLY.

UPDATE OF CENSUS ADDRESSES THE LOCAL PROGRAM AND THREE MILLION TO BEGIN BUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE STATEWIDE OUTREACH AND COMMUNICATIONS EFFORT. ADDING TO THE GOVERNOR'S CURRENT BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN A FORTY POINT THREE. MILLION DOLLARS BRINGS CALIFORNIA'S TOTAL INVESTMENT TO AN UNPRECEDENTED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. NO OTHER STATE IN THE NATION COMES CLOSE. TO THIS INVESTMENT OR IS IT ADVANCE AS ADVANCED IN PLANNING FOR THE DECENNIAL CENSUS CENSUS. THIS FUNDING WILL BE APPROPRIATED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND AVAILABLE FOR A THREE YEAR EFFORT ENDING IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. CENSUS BUREAU ATTEMPTS TO COUNT EVERY RESIDENT IN THE UNITED STATES ONCE EVERY DECADE THE NEXT GENERATION IS APRIL FIRST TWENTY TWENTY AND I'LL BE THE FIRST TIME THE CENSUS BUREAU RELY HEAVILY ON ONLINE RESPONSES. THE PRIMARY CHALLENGE FACING CENSUS BUREAU CONTINUES TO BE THE UNDERCOUNT A SPECIFIC POPULATION GROUPS FOREIGN BORN RESIDENTS ESPECIALLY UNDOCUMENTED NON WHITE RESIDENTS CHILDREN UNDER FIVE YEARS OLD AND RENTERS COMPRISE THE MOST UNDER COUNTY POPULATIONS. AND CALIFORNIA HAS MORE RESIDENTS IN EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES THAN ANY OTHER STATE. OF. BUT WE WILL FACE AN EFFORTS OF UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES THAT YOU GUYS I THINK I KNOW ABOUT SO WANTED JUST PROVIDES A BRIEF HISTORY ON STATEWIDE PAST EFFORTS. IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR POINT SEVEN MILLION WAS SPENT DURING THE CRITICAL SIX MONTH OUTREACH PROGRAM TIMEFRAME FROM JUNE TO JANUARY TO JUNE TWO THOUSAND. AND CALIFORNIA OUTPACED THE ENTIRE NATION IN OUR RESPONSE RATE. REESE RECITE RE RECEIVED IN KIND COMMITMENT AND SUPPORT FROM STATE AGENCIES FOR LEGAL HUMAN RESOURCES CONTRACTING PROCUREMENT AS WELL AS OUTREACH EFFORTS TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE. WE STEP IS TO CALIFORNIA COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE THAT WAS EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL IN REACHING HARD TO COUNT COMMITTEES COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT TRUSTED USING TRUSTED MESSENGER ENGAGEMENT. BUT THE TWENTY TEN CENSUS CALIFORNIA APPOINTED A FIFTY TWO MEMBER COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE AND OUTREACH DIRECTOR HOWEVER DUE TO THE ONE OF THE WORST RECESSIONS IN RECENT HISTORY ONLY TWO MILLION IN FUNDS WERE INVESTED IN THE PROGRAM. MUCH OF THE SUCCESS OF TWENTY TEN WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT OF FOUNDATIONS THAT FUNDED NEARLY TEN MILLION. OF OUTREACH IN ADVERTISING FROM THEIR OWN COFFERS. SINCE THE TWENTY TWENTY EFFORTS WILL DEPLOY SIMILAR COMBINATIONS OF APPROACHES PREVIOUSLY USE TO REACH CALIFORNIA'S HARD TO COUNT RESIDENTS. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A WELL CONNECTED LOCAL NETWORKS OF TARGETED COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND TRUSTED MESSENGERS WE PARDON OF EFFECTIVE OUTREACH IN ADVERTISING EFFORT. BY INVESTING IN RESEARCH AND MESSAGE TESTING THE PAID ADVERTISING AFRICAN ENSURE RESIDENTS UNDERSTAND THE CRITICAL NEED TO BE COUNTED AND ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE DECENNIAL CENSUS IS A FEDERAL OPERATION AND CALIFORNIA'S ACTIVITIES WILL BE MODIFIED BASED UPON THEIR OPERATIONAL. ADVERTISING PARTNERSHIP AND OUTREACH EFFORTS WHICH THEY ARE CURRENTLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED AND HAVE NOT FULLY ON DISCLOSED. OVER THE LAST YEAR WE'VE COLLABORATED PREVIOUSLY WITH PREVIOUSLY ENGAGED PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS TO DISCUSS A STATEWIDE OUTREACH STRATEGY AND BEST PRACTICES FOR AN EFFECTIVE DEPLOYMENT. WITH THE GOVERNOR'S UNPRECEDENTED VESPIDAE A FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS PRIVATE FOUNDATIONS ONE TO BE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN CONCORDANT WITH US AND THEY'RE CONSIDERING A MATCH OF FUNDS. THE STATE IS PREPARING AND PLANNING TO ADDRESS NEW CHALLENGES FOR A SUCCESSFUL. TWENTY TWENTY I JUST WANNA SAY THAT IN THE LAST FOUR WEEKS WE'VE HANDLED SEVEN REGIONAL CONVENIENCE ARE OUT OF THE THE OVER TWENTY FIVE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE DO IN THE NEXT TWELVE WEEKS. AND WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BETWEEN TRIBAL CONSULTATIONS AND A WE ALSO LOST OUR WEBSITE MY TEAM AND I STAND READY TO PARTNER WITH TRUSTED MESSENGERS ACROSS THE STATE. TO ENSURE A COMPLETE AND ACCURATE COUNT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'LL BE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU FINANCE. THINK YOU'RE BECCA KIRK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WANTED TO REITERATE SOME OF MS DETAINEES COMMENTS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION DEFTLY RECOGNIZES THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS EFFORT. I'M COMBINED WITH CURRENT YOUR RESOURCES OF TEN MILLIONDOLLARS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL. REPRESENTS OF A REQUEST OF FIFTY POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. FOR CENSUS ACTIVITIES WHICH IS AS WITH PICKING MENTIONED A HISTORIC STATE LEVEL INVESTMENT MORE THAN TWICE THAT OF PREVIOUS EFFORTS. FURTHERMORE THE FUNDING THE FORTY POINT THREE MILLION IN THIS REQUEST OR IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS PROVIDED FULLY IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO ENSURE MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY THROUGHOUT THE THREE YEAR EFFORT. ALSO WE WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE COMMITTEE STAFFS PROPOSED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO AUGMENT CENSUS FUNDING AND POSITIONS IF NECESSARY DURING THE FISCAL YEAR WOULD ENHANCE THE ABILITY TO BE RESPONSIVE TO ANY POTENTIAL NEED FOR CHANGES MOVING FORWARD. OUR PROPOSED UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENT BE FLEXIBILITY INHERENT IN PROVIDING THE FUNDS UP FRONT. AND COMMITTEE STAFF PROPOSED PROVISIONAL BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE PROVIDE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES AND FLEXIBILITY AT THIS POINT IN TIME. REGARDING THE RECOMMENDED INCREASE OF TWENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR THIS EFFORT. WE WOULD NEED ADDITIONAL TIME TO DETERMINE WHETHER. THAT FUNDING IS PRUDENT AT THIS TIME AND WHAT IT WOULD NEED TO BE SPENT ON. THANK YOU AND TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT AND NUMBER ONE I'M OBVIOUSLY THIS COMING UP IN IN TWENTY TWENTY. OF THOSE ROOKIES MISSIONS RECORD FUNDING FOR THE CENSUS. WITH ASSISTANCE OF ISSUE IN THE INTERNET ISSUE OFF OF NOT HAVING ACCESS INTERNET. HOW MUCH MORE INFORMATION YOU NEED TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT? BUT AT THE CENTRAL FIGURE OUT WITH ASSISTANCE SHOULD QUESTION IT BEING A PART OF IT. A LOT OF FOLKS NOT HAVING INTERNET JUST A LOT OF FOLKS MY DISTRICT DON'T HAVE IT. S. ADVENTURE MY COLLEAGUES DON'T SO. THAT'S ARE NOT SURE HOW THAT CONNECTS TOGETHER WITH MORE YOU WOULD NEED. RIGHT SO WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS UNCERTAINTY IN THIS EFFORT PARTICULARLY FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS GIVEN AS YOU MENTIONEDA COUPLE OF. A NEW ELEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN THROWN INTO THE MIX. WE DO FEEL THOUGH THAT GIVING THAT FUNDING UP FRONT WOULD ALLOW YOU KNOW REGARDLESS OF THE PROPOSED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO COME BACK IF ADDITIONAL FUNDING WERE NEEDED BASED ON. SOME OF THESE VARIOUS ELEMENTS. ESPECIALLY WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFFS PROPOSED BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD GIVE US THE FLEXIBILITY TO DO SO WITHIN THE FISCAL YEAR WE WOULD HAVE ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY. BOTH TO SPEND THE MONEY AS NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A SUCCESSFUL EFFORT AND TO AUGMENT THAT AS NECESSARY BEEN AND HOW WOULD THAT WOULD UNDER COUNT HARMLESS. IN THE KIND OF THE CENSUS. PARDON SORRY IN ITEMS HELD THAT IT WOULD UNDER COUNTERPART THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SEVEN UNDER COUNTY PLUMAS COULD TAKE YOU MIGHT HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER I THINK IT'S APPROXIMATELY NINETEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. A PER YEAR FOR A TEN YEAR PERIOD THAT WOULD BE LOST FOR UNDERCOUNTED INDIVIDUALS IN FEDERAL FUNDING AS WELL VERSED PER PERSON. RIGHT PER PER UNDERFUNDED INDIVIDUAL. AND THERE'S ALSO THE POTENTIAL FOR IMPLICATIONS FOR THE NUMBER OF SEATS THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. SO AGAIN. OPPOSITE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AGREES THAT THIS EFFORT IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE AND WANTS TO SEE IT BE SUCCESSFUL. LL. RUNNING AT. THOMAS MISTER CHIU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ARE. LET ME ECHO WHAT THE CHAIR SAID AND SOMETHING WE ALL KNOW THIS MAY BE ONE OF THE IF NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT BUDGET DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE AS FAR AS. ARE OUR FUTURE BUDGET IN STATE. AYE AND A I DO VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. THE INITIAL PROPOSALS BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. BUT WE ARE AN UNPRECEDENTED TIMES AND WE HAVE A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT UNFORTUNATE THIS MOMENT IS NOT WORKING PARTICULARLY WELL WITH US HERE. OUGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS COUNTED. WITH THE NEW POLICIES THAT ARE PROPOSED IN THE AND THE LAWSUITS THAT HAVE BEEN SUED. ARM SO ONE ISSUE THAT I HAVEN'T AND I'M I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS IS WELL I APPRECIATE THE SOFT COMMITMENT ON WHAT THE BUDGET WILL LOOK LIKE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. THERE'S BEEN NO CERTAINTY AS TO WHAT. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION FUNDED WILL LOOK LIKE AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. CBO OUTREACH IS POSSIBLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE COULD DO I CERTAINLY WE CERTAINLY EXPERIENCE IN SAN FRANCISCO IN TWO THOUSAND TEN. ARE THE ONLY REASON OUR CENSUS NUMBERS ARE WE. HAD SOME THE MOST ACCURATE COUNTS IN THE STATE WAS WE AS A CITY DEVOTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO TO OUTREACH THROUGH CBO'S. AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT'S PART OF THE PLAN BUT THERE'S NOT A WILLINGNESS AT THIS TIME TO COMMIT TO THAT. OF I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT WE COULD MAKE THOSE COMMITMENTS IF THAT IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE IF THE ISSUE IS. IS IS WHETHER. DEAL WITH HAS A STAFFING TO FIGURE THIS OUT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE NEED TO GIVE THEIR APARTMENT TIME TO DO THAT BUT NOT HAVING A HARD COMMITMENT ON WHAT THAT CBO OUT REACH IS GONNA LOOK LIKE. A I THINK IS IS IS CONCERNING MANY OF US AND AND I'VE CERTAINLY HEARD ALREADY JUST IN THE LAST TWELVE HOURS CONCERNS AROUND STATE ON THIS TOPIC SO. I WONDER IF YOU HAVE A PERSPECTIVE ON ON THAT QUESTION. CERTAINLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL DOES INCLUDE TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS BILL TEN FOR CBO OUTREACH. VOTE CBO OUT REACHES LARGER PORTION OF THIS TWENTY TWENTY CENSUS PLANNED ON A HOUSE BEEN IN SOME PRIOR YEARS RECOGNIZING. THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPORTANCE OF HAVING LOCAL LEVEL OUTREACH INVOLVED IN THIS EFFORT. AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS YOU CAN APPRECIATE THE TWELFTH. THE TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS SAN FRANCISCO SPENT I BELIEVE TEN MILLION DOLLARS JUST ON ONE CITY AND THAT'S HOW WE MADE SURE THAT ARE UNDER COUNT A WAS NOT. DIDN'T INCREASE AND I JUST OF THE QUICK MATH LITERALLY AS YOU'RE SAYING THAT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A DISTRICT IS EQUIVALENT OF. YOU KNOW ONE OR TWO F. T. EASE I DON'T THINK THAT'S A THAT I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S ADEQUATE. NOT GIVEN WHAT'S AT STAKE IF IF WE IF WE DON'T GET THIS RIGHT. SO I JUST WANNA PUT THAT OUT THERE IS A PERSPECTIVE ARE. MY HOPE IS WE MIGHT BE ABLE HOLE THIS OPEN FOR A FEW DAYS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION BUT IN OBVIOUSLY. THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. BROOKE DAVIS CHAIR. YEAH THERE WAS A LOT OF NUMBER SO AROUND I JUST WANNA GO BACK TO. WHAT WHAT HE SAID THE STATE WAS TWO POINT SOMETHING MILLION IN TWO THOUSAND TEN AND THEN FOUNDATIONS CAME IN WITH TEN MILLION SO TWELVE POINT SOMETHING WAS THE TOTAL EFFORT IN TWO THOUSAND TEN? YES AND THEN THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU HAD A LOT OF THE AMERICAN RECOVERY ACT DOLLARS SO THEY ACTUALLY OF HIRED PARTNERSHIP ASSISTANCE. ACROSS THE BORDER MOTHER HOW MUCH THAT WAS FROM THE FEDS I THOUGHT THAT MY REMEMBER ON DECEMBER TWENTY FOURTH TWO THOUSAND NINE IT WAS LIKE THAT HUNDRED MILLION ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THEN THEY WENT OUT AND HIRED SO I DON'T HAVE IT POLKA DOWN TO THE STATE BUT FOR. ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF THE PROPAGANDA NEW BICU MET CHAIR COMMENTS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DO YOU HAVE A DATE WILL WE KNOW WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GOING TO DO ON THIS. SO. I THINK THE LAST THING I SAW WAS THAT IN OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR THE CENSUS BUREAU'S OUR OUTREACH INTEGRATED OUTREACH AND COMMUNICATION PARTNERSHIP PLAN WOULD BE IN FULL SWING THEY ARE NOT SCHEDULED TO HIRE ANY PARTNERSHIP SPECIALS WHICH ARE THE PEOPLE THAT ARE. IN YOUR DISTRICTS. UNTIL OF LATE OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR OKAY AND BASED OFF THE COM. PLAN. IT LOOKS LIKE THIRTY MILLION OF THE FIFTY MILLION IS GONNA TV AND AND NONPROFITS TO DO OUTREACH IS THAT SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'VE DONE IN THE PAST. SO IN A VERY VERY EFFECTIVE IT'S HONESTLY TV IT'S A MULTI LINGUAL AND THAT'S ACTUALLY MICRO TARGETED SO IN THE CAN MEETINGS THAT WERE DOING OUT YOUR COMMUNITY. YOUR COMMITTEES WE'RE MEETING WITH TRUSTED MESSENGERS THERE TO IDENTIFY THOSE REALLY ACTUAL LIKE ETHNIC MEDIA I MEAN THAT IN TWO THOUSAND I DID A LOT OF I WANNA TONGUE IN TALK SHOW WITH. AROUND IN A LOT OF THE ETHNIC MEDIA OUTLETS THAT ARE KNOWN TO HAVE A NIELSEN RATING THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE MOST EFFECTIVE AND SO PART OF OUR CAN MEETINGS IS TO. UNDERSTAND FROM THE COMMUNITY WHO THOSE WHO THE TALENTS ARE YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO A LOT OF THE LEGWORK FIRST WITH COME TAX RETURNS AND OTHER. FISHING LICENSES AND THINGS LIKE THAT CAN YOU GET A LOT OF THE DATA UP FRONT AND THEN YOU. PROBABLY HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF OUR POPULATION AND YOU CAN YOU. MAKE A PLANET JUST TARGET THAT. SO THAT OF THE BROAD STATEWIDE APPROACH GREAT SO THIS AGAIN THE CENSUS BUREAU DOES A LOT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD STUFF OUR ROLE HERE THE STATE. ON WE DON'T DO ANY OF THE COUNTING WERE JUST DOING OUTREACH AND IN IN TWO THOUSAND WE FOCUSED STRICTLY. ARE ON THE HARD TO COUNT AREAS WHICH THERE'S YOU KNOW OWN. BASICALLY A DIFFERENT PARAMETERS ABOUT WHAT MAKES AN AREA OR POPULATION HARD TO COUNT AND I CAN INTEGRATE THROUGH THAT IF YOU WANT ME TO AND SO OUR EFFORTS HERE THE STATE HAVE BEEN ONLY REALLY FOCUSED ON THE HARDEST COUNTING CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU WILL DO KIND OF A A WIDE SWATH OF ADVERTISING ANNOUNCING THIS BILL DO THE MAJORITY OF THE THE NO BIG YEAH FROM. CENSUS FOR OUR OF. TAX FILINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT THEY COLLECT THAT DATA IN THAT IT'S IT'S OUR ROLE AS A STATE. TO DO THE MARKETING ESSENTIALLY TO ARCTIC CALIFORNIANS I THINK WE'VE LEARNED IN THE PAST THAT. THE FOLKS IN IN DC WHEN IT COMES OUT HERE THEY'RE NOT AS EFFECTIVE IN ACTUALLY HAVING MESSAGES THAT ARE CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE OR THAT RESONATE WITH CALIFORNIANS. WELL THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION PERSIA. THANK YOU. GOING OPEN UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT.

PARTICULARLY AS WE HAVE SHARED IN OUR ANALYSIS AND LETTER THAT IT'S GOING TO COST. HUNDRED SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS PLEASE HUNDRED SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS PLUS FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS.

AS WE HAVE HAD IN THE PAST AND SITE WE'RE ACTUALLY WORRY ABOUT A LOWER RESPONSE RATE THAN EVER BEFORE. AND THIS IS WHAT WE ARE I'M HEARING FROM. OR ON ALREADY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES. A IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THIS PROBLEM A STATE MUST INVEST HEAVILY IN THIS YEAR'S. STUMP CENSUS OUT WHICH IMPLANTING IT HAS TO HAPPEN IN THIS FISCAL YEAR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
