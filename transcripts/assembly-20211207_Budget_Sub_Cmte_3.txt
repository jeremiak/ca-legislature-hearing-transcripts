THIS YEAR WE WERE ABLE TO APPROPRIATE CLOSE TO SEVEN YEARS WORTH OF NORMAL SPENDING FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND COMMITTED TO A MINIMUM OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS. BUT OF COURSE DOLLARS AND NO ONE ALONE WILL NOT PREVENT WILDFIRES WE MUST ENSURE THAT THESE FUEL REDUCTION COMMUNITY. PROTECTION PROJECTS ARE DONE IN A TIMELY AND EQUITABLE MANNER. BEFORE WE BEGIN I WITH THE PRESENTATION OF OUR PANELISTS WOULD ANY OF OUR OTHER MEMBERS LIKE TO PROVIDE OPENING REMARKS SHOULD WELCOME MR FONG- OUR BUDGET TO. VICE CHAIR TO THE HEARING AND TO PLEASE PROVIDE YOUR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR- AND YOUR STAFF- FOR- FOR GETTING HIS HEARING- ON THE SCHEDULE- I KNOW THIS HEARING HAS TAKEN A LOT OF COORDINATION AND APPRECIATE IF IT EVER OF YOURSELF IN THE COMMITTEE IN THE PALACE- AND THE STAFF TO RESCHEDULE COME TOGETHER AND ONE OF THE LAST HEARINGS. HERE IN THE CAPITOL ANNEX- THAT THE HARSH WILDFIRES THAT BURNED ALL LAST SUMMER DESTROYED ENTIRE COMMUNITIES. HAVE UP LOW WE'VE EXPERIENCED LIGHT LIVES LOST. I'M IT WAS THAT EXPERIENCE. THAT ARE PUT RISK. OF FIRE SUPPRESSION- WAS COOLEY THE PRIORITY. BUT NOW WE NEED TO PLAN FOR THE NEXT WILDFIRE SEASON WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT WE ARE- WHERE WE WERE AND WHERE WE NEED TO BE. AT WILDFIRES. NATURALLY OCCUR BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE DISASTROUS THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE CATASTROPHIC. WE WANT QUALIFIERS THAT ARE LESS DESTRUCTIVE. THE STATE IS EXPECTING ANOTHER YEAR OUT WITH A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUSES- THIS GIVES THE GOVERNOR. AND THE LEGISLATURE- THE ABILITY. TO CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE WILDFIRE PREVENTION. AT THE CONSUMING IS FUNDING- IS A START BUT THERE ARE STILL MILLIONS OF ACRES LEFT TO TREAT- AND THERE IS STILL FAR TOO MUCH FUEL READY TO BURN. THE STATE IS FACING IS SORT DROUGHT RESULTING IN BONE DRY SHRUBS AND TREES AND FUELS IN OUR FORCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES- AND WE NEED TO ACT WITH A SENSE OF URGENCY- DURING THIS WINDOW THAT WE NOW HAVE TO PREPARE. THE DEVASTATION WE HAVE SEEN HERE AND YOU'RE OUT. MUST STOP AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE PALACE- AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. MR GALLAGHER COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT- WE WILL NOW WELCOME OUR FIRST PANELISTS WHO IS HELEN CHRISTIAN FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. MORNING AND MY NAME IS CHRISTINE AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'M GONNA BE SPEAKING FROM A PRESENTATION WHICH I WAS GONNA LOAD RIGHT NOW. HOPEFULLY YOU CAN SEE THAT ON YOUR SCREEN AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE SLIDES ARE POSTED ON THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET SUB COMMITTEES BACKSIDE. PROPOSED YOU'RE FOLLOWING ALONG AT HOME AS WELL HEARING BY PROVIDING SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION I'M GONNA START MY PRESENTATION WITH A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION ON WILDFIRES MORE GENERALLY AND THEN I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT RECENT WILDFIRES SPENDING. I'M NOT SPECIFICALLY TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF THE RECENT BUDGET ACTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS TAKEN. IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO INCREASE WELFARE RESILIENCE. SO THIS FIRST. SHOWS REALLY FOLLOW THEM LARGEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES HAVE. AND HAVE BEEN CONCENTRATED IN THE LAST FEW DECADES SO THIS GOES BACK TO NINETEEN THE NINETEEN THIRTIES WHEN WE STARTED. REALLY COLLECTING THIS DATA AND YOU CAN SEE THAT- IF WE LOOK AT THE LARGEST THE TWENTY LARGEST AND TWENTY MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES. ARE THE BOTH OF THEM HAVE HAPPENED IN RECENT DECADES AND ACTUALLY IT'S PRETTY. DRAMATIC HERE EIGHTEEN OF THAT AT THAT TWENTY MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES HAVE OCCURRED SINCE TWO THOUSAND. AND FULLY SEVEN AM OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE TWENTY WITH INSTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES WHAT HAPPENED JUST IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. SO WE'VE REALLY SEEN A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THE DESTRUCTIVE ABOUT PRIOR TO THE STATE HAS EXPERIENCED. THIS NEXT SLIDE SHOWS A MAP OF CALIFORNIA WITH THOSE TWENTY AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE LARGEST WILDFIRES ON THE LOCATIONS AND THAT'S WHAT MATTERS. AND THESE ARE THE ONES THAT OCCURRED SINCE TWO THOUSAND. AND YOU CAN SEE HOW THIS IS IN A REGIONAL PROBLEM IT'S NOT JUST A LOCAL PROBLEM IT'S A PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS A WIDE SWATH OF THE STATE. AND OF COURSE THE IMPACTS OF WILDFIRES EXTEND BEYOND JUST THE BORDERS OF THE WILDFIRES- AS WE ALL EXPERIENCED IN RECENT YEARS- WELL THE MOST OF YOUR IMPACTS OUR COMMUNITY AREAS THAT BRING THEMSELVES- IMPACTED AS SMOKE THAT CAN EXTEND WELL BEYOND THE BORDERS OF WILDFIRES THAT REALLY THIS IS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR THE STATE SET TO TACKLE. THIS NEXT SLIDE SHOWS STATE SPENDING ON HEALTH FIRE AND HOW IT'S GOING TO BRING ABOUT THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS AND YOU CAN SEE IT'S PRETTY DRAMATIC FROM ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION. TO THREE POINT FOUR BILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO- IT'S REALLY GROWN PRETTY DRAMATICALLY. THIS FIGURE BREAKS OUT HELLFIRE AND THE CALPERS BUDGET INTO THREE MAIN CATEGORIES. BASED FIRE PROTECTION AND YOU CAN SEE THAT- HAS PRETTY STEADILY INCREASED OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS OR SO- EMERGENCY FIRE SUPPRESSION AND THAT'S BASICALLY WHEN FIGHTERS EXCEED THE INITIAL ATTACK SO WHEN WE HAVE LARGER WILDFIRES- AND HEALTHCARE NEEDS TO IT TO ADD SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO FIGHT THOSE. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT VARIES FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND THAT'S NOT SURPRISING ON MANY YEARS WE HAVE PARTICULARLY SEVERE WILDFIRES WE SEE- ABOUT THE NET EMERGENCY FIRE SUPPRESSION SPENDING. AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FIRE PREVENTION AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THAT WAS PRETTY STEADY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND IT'S INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS WITH THE ADDITION OF FUNDS FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND- OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. AND THAT'S REALLY THAT THIS LIFE THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT FOCUSING ON AT THIS AND THIS HEARING- AND IT IS NOTABLE THAT IT'S AND WE'VE MADE. A LOT OF ADDITIONAL- INVEST INVESTMENTS IN THAT AREA OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS- BUT IT'S STILL IT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL SHARE I'M STILL FIRE PROTECTION AND FIRE SUPPRESSION ARE. ARE LARGER AND IN IN IN TOTAL SO- HOPEFULLY IT GETS A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORICAL CONTEXT NOW I'M GONNA TALK JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FUNDING. THAT WAS PROVIDED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THERE TO. PACKAGES THAT WERE BY THE LATEST IN FOR TWENTY ONE. THE FIRST ONE AS- AND EARLY ACTION WHILE. PASS THAT WEIGHS A THAT PROVIDED FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION FOR A VARIETY OF WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PROGRAMS. ACROSS THE STATE TO EUROPE ABOUT TWO DOZEN DIFFERENT PROGRAMS ACROSS ABOUT FOURTEEN DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS. THAT WAS THE FUNDING AND REALLY THAT FUNDING WAS- IN ADDITION TO THE FUNDING IS PROVIDED IN A TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET- BUT IT WAS REALLY PART OF THAT BUDGET THAT WITH ANOTHER ON PETITIONS THAT BUDGET. MOST OF THE FUNDING WAS PROVIDED FROM THE GENERAL FUND SO IN TOTAL IT WAS I CAN COMPLETE ABOUT TWO FOUR HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION THAT WAS PROVIDED FROM THE GENERAL FUND. HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION WAS PROVIDED FROM G. G. R. AFTER GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND. AND THE IDEA BEHIND THAT WAS TO BRING THE TEACHER OF SPENDING TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS CONSISTENT WITH SB NINE OH ONE. AMEND THAT BILL HAD. INDICATED THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND INTENDED TO SPEND TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. ANNUALLY FOR FIVE YEARS. AND THEN THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE ALSO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE REASON WHY IT WASDONE AS AN EARLY ACTION PACKAGE WISE. BUT THE GOAL IS TO GET THE FINDING OUT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THAT WAS TO DEDICATE THE FUNDS TOWARDS PROJECT THAT WE'RE BASICALLY READY TO GO. AND I CAN GET STARTED IMMEDIATELY AND THAT WAY AND THOSE PROJECT THE IDEA WOULD BE THAT THIS PROJECT WOULD BE IN PLACE ROUGHLY A YEAR SOONER THAN THEY WOULD BE OTHERWISE AND IF. THE FUNDING HAD BEEN AND HAD BEEN INCLUDED IN A TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUDGET. AND I'M GONNA TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET- THAT WAS ANOTHER. HISTORIC AUGMENTATION SO THAT BUDGET PROVIDED AN ADDITIONAL NINE HUNDRED. AND EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. FOR A WIDE RANGE OF PROGRAMS- ABOUT THIRTY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS MANAGED BY ABOUT EIGHTEEN DIFFERENT APARTMENTS. AGAIN MOST OF THAT MONEY WAS GOING TO GENERAL FUND. SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT MILLION. A TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION WAS FROM TEACHER AT. ARE THERE A COUPLE OTHER IMPORTANT ASPECTS AND THAT PACKAGE. SEVEN THERE WAS A TRAILER BILL THAT ADDED LANGUAGE THE CONTINUING. CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATES. I GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION. I'M STARTING IN. TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE THREE TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY NINE SO- I KNOW THAT YOU'RE MENTIONED THAT. BEFORE BUT IT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THAT- BUDGET PACKAGE I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT AGAIN. I THE BUDGET. INCLUDED SOME REPORT LANGUAGE WE THINK IS REALLY I'M REALLY BURKE HIGHLIGHTING AS WELL. AND THAT REPORTING LINK LANGUAGE REQUIRES ADMINISTRATIVE ADMINISTRATION EXCUSE ME TO PROVIDE CERTAIN INFORMATION ON ALL OF THAT. A WILDFIRE RESILIENCE FUND THAT WERE PROVIDED BOTH IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY DEAL AS WELL AS THE EARLY ACTION MONEY THAT WAS PROVIDED IN TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- BUT WILL ELP LEGISLATURE. I UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS FUNDED IT WITH THOSE- THOSE DOLLARS AND- WHAT WHAT AND WHAT WE REALLY GOT FROM FROM ALL THAT HISTORIC INVESTMENT. SO THE NEXT FIGURED THIS IS BY CATEGORY BUT THIS REALLY SHOWS THOSE EARLY ACTION AND BUDGET ACT- PACKAGES. AND IT BREAKS IT OUT BY CATEGORIES THERE ARE FIVE MAIN CATEGORIES THAT RECEIVED FUNDING. YOU CAN SEE THE FUNDS WERE APPROPRIATED AS WELL AS THE- PERCENTAGES HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BASS BAR. AND IT'S I THINK THERE ARE A FEW THINGS I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT ABOUT THIS FIGURE FOR YOU- WHAT YOU CAN SEE HOW THE FUNDING WAS DISTRIBUTED AMONG THOSE GUYS MAIN CATEGORIES OF EXPENDITURES IN THIS AREA. YOU CAN SEE THAT MOST OF THE FUNDING FOR BOTH PACKAGES WENT TO RESILIENT FORESTS AND LANDSCAPES SURPRISE SO PROGRAMS THAT REALLY EMPHASIZE THAT. ON THE SECOND LARGEST SHARE WAS FOR WILDFIRE FUEL BREAKS- AND THEN THEY WERE SMALLER DOLLAR APPLICATIONS FOR COMMUNITY HARDENING. FOR SECTOR ECONOMIC. STIMULUS AND SCIENCE BASED MANAGEMENT- YOU CAN ALSO SEE. THAT A LARGE FRACTION OF A LARGE SHARE OF THE EARLY ACTION FUNDING HAS BEEN COMMITTED EIGHTY SEVEN PERCENT. AND A SMALLER SHARE OF THAT OF THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET DOLLARS HAVE BEEN COMMITTED THAT'S PART ONLY SEVEN PERCENT- NOW THAT'S NOT REALLY SURPRISING. FOR A COUPLE REASONS WHY OF COURSE THE BUDGET- THE BUDGET ACTION BUT LATER IN THE YEAR THAN THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE BUT ALSO. THERE REALLY ACTION PACKAGE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE WAS REALLY FOCUSED ON PROJECTS THAT WERE READY TO GO AND THE IDEA WAS THAT THOSE COULD BE COMMITTED VERY QUICKLY AND SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT WE SAW THOSE DOLLARS. HE COMMITTED MORE QUICKLY. WITH THAT WITH A BUDGET ALLOCATION THE IDEA WAS THAT YOU KNOW THAT THAT FUNDING WOULD PROBABLY BE USED OVER AND OVER A- POTENTIALLY A PERIOD OF A FEW YEARS. AND SO IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT SOME OF THOSE DOLLARS HAVE HAVEN'T. BEEN COMMITTED YET. I'M YOU CAN ALSO SEE THAT. THERE'S VARIATION IN THE PERCENT THAT'S BEEN COMMITTED CATEGORIES SO YOU CAN SEE THAT. OVERALL AND HIGHER SHARE HAS BEEN COMMINGLED FOR THEIR RESILIENT FORESTS AND LANDSCAPES CATEGORY IN THE WILDFIRE FUEL BREAKS CATEGORY. AS WELL AS A SCIENCE BASED MANAGEMENT CATEGORY- THEN FOR EXAMPLE THE COMMUNITY HARDENING AND THE FOUR SECTORS STIMULUS CATEGORIES. SO WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT YOU CAN GET THE OVERALL PICTURE. AND THEN THE NEXT TWO FIGHTS BREAK THESE CATEGORIES OUT INTO THE INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS. THAT'S THAT WAY YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S SOME. SEPARATION AND LOOK AT A DIFFERENT STORY FOR CHRISTMAS. SPECIFIC PROGRAMS. HELLO THIS IS FIRST HALF OF THE TWO PEOPLE INTO TABLE TO SPEAK THERE IS- THERE ARE A OF YOUR- PROGRAMS AND WE CAN IT ALL AND ONE FIVE AND HAVE IT BE. AN WHY. I'M HERE YOU CAN SEE FOR WITHIN WITH. FOR SOMEONE'S. OVER ON 93% OF THE EARLY ACTION FUNDING HAS BEEN COMMITTED THUS FAR. BUT THERE IS VARIATION ACROSS DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SO FOR EXAMPLE THE FOREST HEALTH PROGRAM- YOU KNOW. ALL ABOUT FUNDING HAS BEEN COMMITTED WHERE YOU CAN SEE FOR EXAMPLE THAT AND YOU KNOW RESOURCE NEEDS REFORESTATION NURSERY. URBAN FORESTRY INTERVAL AND GAUGE MEANT ON BEHALF I THINK COMMITTEE YEAH. AND I DID WANT TO NOTE HERE ALSO JUST ON WHAT COMMITTED MEANS THAT SOMETIMES THAT CAN BE A LITTLE BIT OF A CONFUSING TERMS. USUALLY THAT MEANS ALLOCATED TO PROJECTS OR MEDIA GRANT AGREEMENT SAYS IS SIGN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS- IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT THE PROJECT HAS HAS BEEN COMPLETED SO COULD STILL TAKE SOME TIME FOR THIS PROJECT. ACTUALLY THE FULLY IN PLACE AND OPERATIONAL BUT IT DOES MEAN THAT THAT THE MONEY HAS BEEN. ALLOCATED AND IT'S SORT OF YEAH. IT'S IN PLACE AND DEDICATED. I SO THIS IS THE FIRST HAPPEN AT. AND THEN THIS HALF THE TABLE JUST SHOWS- AND THE REMAINING PROGRAMS SO YOU CAN SEE KIND OF THAT THE STATUS OF THOSE AND THEN I. AM THE WAY THAT THAT FUNDING IS GOING OUT AS WELL. SEN AND THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS- THAT MANY HEALTH. THANK YOU- CAN YOU OFFER SOME- COMMENTS ARE JUST- EXPLANATION WHY THERE'S SUCH A DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE BETWEEN- IN TERMS OF THE PERCENT COMMITTED ON THE EARLY ACTION DOLLARS BETWEEN RESILIENT FORESTS AND FUEL BREAKS FOR EXAMPLE AND COMMUNITY HARDENING IN THE FOR SECTOR ECONOMIC STIMULUS THOSE ARE PRETTY DRAMATIC. DROP OFFS. YEAH AND THAT MAYBE SOMETHING THAT- THAT THE MINISTRATION WOULD BE BETTER POSITIONED AND TO- TO TALK ABOUT BUT MIGHT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS TECH AND KNOWS IS THAT SOME OF A LOT OF THE FUNDING IN THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE WENT TO ESTABLISH PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN IN PLACE FOR SEVERAL YEARS- AND THAT. IN GENERAL IT TENDS TO BE EASIER TO GET THAT FINDING OUT A LITTLE MORE QUICKLY- BUT THERE WERE SOME FRIENDS THAT WENT TO RELATIVELY NEW PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE THAT HOME GARDENING A LOT OF THAT COMMITTEE HARDENING DOLLARS WERE RELATED TO THE HOME GARDENING- PROGRAM AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S JUST BEING LAUNCHED. SO AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE MORE INFORMATION BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT'S TAKING SOME TIME TO GET THAT PROGRAMS ARE UP AND RUNNING AND FIGURE OUT ALL THE DETAILS AND WORK WITH. DAVE YOU'RE TRYING TO DO MATCHING FUNDS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT'S I THINK TAKEN SOMETIME AS WELL SO AGAIN THEY THEY AY BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THAT MORE DEPTH BUT I THINK PART OF IT IS JUST THAT CERTAIN PROGRAMS. TAKE A LITTLE BIT LONGER TO GET UP AND RUNNING- AND THEN THEY MAY BE A MORE ESTABLISHED PROGRAM MAKING. JUST ANOTHER GRANT CYCLE OF. GREAT THANK THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MR FONG. I THINK REPORT FOR THE PRESENTATION- I GUESS MY- BUT- TO PIGGYBACK OFF WHAT THE CHAIR SAID IN HIS OPENING REMARKS HOW WOULD YOU OR THE L. A. L. OR HOW SHOULD WE AS A LEGISLATURE AND EVALUATE. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FUNDING SO WHAT IS SUCCESS. BUT WHAT WOULD YOU DO AS SUCCESS. I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND I THINK IT'S I MEAN ULTIMATELY I THINK ARE ALL HER GOAL IS TO HAVE FOREST THAT ARE THAT ARE RESILIENT AND HEALTHY RIGHT AND THAT ARE LESS PRONE TO SEVERE AND DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES- SO I THINK THAT'S A REALLY THAT'S SORT OF THE ULTIMATE GOAL IT'S- SOMETIMES HARD TO MEASURE EXACTLY. EXACTLY THAT BUT I THINK LOOKING AT YOU KNOW HOW MANY AND HOW MANY ANSWER WHICH TYPES OF YOUR ARE WE MEETING OUR GOALS FOR I TREATING ACRES AND ARE IN RETREATING ACRES THAT ARE REALLY PROTECTING AND COMMUNITIES AND HAVING ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS IT'S PROBABLY A MIX OF THINGS BUT I THINK THOSE ARE ALL I THINK THE TYPES OF GOALS THAT- RESISTING. AND CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE I'LL WANT TO AND KEEP AN EYE ON AND I'M I THINK THAT THEIR- WITH ITS REPORTING LANGUAGE THEY'LL BE SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL HELP THE LEGISLATURE KEEP TRACK OF. OF WHAT ACTUALLY IS BEING ACCOMPLISHED WITH THIS FUNDING AND WHETHER THAT'S HELPING TO MEET THOSE GOALS SURE SO I GUESS THAT THEN. THAT THE NEXT QUESTION THEN IS. IN IN OVER. THIS THE FUNDING AND WHAT WAS WHAT HAS BEEN COMMITTED. DO YOU HAVE THAT DATA TO OVERLAID WHAT PROJECTS WERE DONE AND WHAT THEY MIGHT OF ACRES THAT WERE TREATED AND WHETHER THE CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE HAVE IMPROVED- IN TERMS OF HEALTHY FORCE. THOUGHT THAT I'M LOOKING AT I MEAN I'M LOOKING AT THE MAP THAT YOU'VE GOT THE FIRST ONE WITH ALL THE- THAT THE LIST OF THE FIRES I MEAN. DO WE HAVE A LOOK WE HAVE A LIST OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED AND WHERE WHEN WHAT AREAS THERE THERE ARE. SO WE DO HAVE A LIST OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED OF THE MINISTRATION WAS KIND ENOUGH TO PROVIDE AND A LIST OF THE PROJECTS THAT THEY'VE COMMITTED FUNDING TO- WE DO HAVE THAT LIST WE HAVE NOT. AND THAT'S PRETTY EARLY YOU KNOW BUT THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGES WELL ANYWAY IT'S BEEN COMMITTED THUS FAR ON THE- ON THE BUDGET YEAR FUNDING. pIT'S A LITTLE HARD IT'S PROBABLY TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF AN- AN EFFORT TO REALLY DRILL DOWN AND FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHERE EACH PROJECT IS LOCATED. AND FIGURE OUT I THINK THEN YOU HAVE TO DO IS PROBABLY PRETTY COMPLEX AND TO FIGURE OUT AND- EXACTLY WHICH AREAS ARE COVERED- WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT ANALYSIS BUT I. THINK I'M- JUST AND LOOKING AT IT. pPROJECTS THAT WERE FUNDED IN A VARIETY OF AREAS IN THE ADMINISTRATION. MAY WELL HAVE. MORE I HER ABOUT IT ON AND ON EXACTLY DID YOU. JUST OF THE- WELL MAYBE THAT'S THE- AB IF THAT POSSIBLE TO DO AN AWESOME INITIATION AS WELL BUT A BIT OVERLAY- THE PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN FUNDED AND COMPLETED OVER THIS MAP THAT YOU'VE OUTLINED- IN TERMS OF THE MOST DAMAGING WILDFIRES SINCE TWO THOUSAND. COULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY CORRELATION IN TERMS OF WHETHER THEY WERE PROJECTS THAT WERE DONE OR NOT DONE OR CONTINUE TO BE DONE IN THE AREAS THAT ARE HIGH PRONE FOR CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. IS THAT POSSIBLE. YOUR STAFF HE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE I WOULD NOTE THAT THE PROJECT HAD BEEN AND COMMITTED YOU KNOW THAT THAT LIST THAT WE HAVE PROPOSED EARLY ACTION PACKETS AND THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. IN MANY CASES AGAIN THOSE HAVE THE PROJECT HAPPENS- THE SISTERLY THEN COMPLETED SO THOSE ARE THOSE ARE PROJECTS THAT HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING BY. AND THEY MAY STILL BE IN. THE EARLY STAGES SO IT'S NOT THAT THOSE PROJECTS WOULD NECESSARILY. YOU KNOW IT MAY TAKE A FEW YEARS FOR THIS TO ACTUALLY HAPPEN BUT- BUT YEAH WE CAN WORK WITH YOUR STAFF AND SEE AND SEE WHAT'S AVAILABLE. SURE I MEAN I GUESS THAT THAT THE BROADER POINT IS IT'S NOT JUST THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE. IT'S WHAT HAS BEEN DONE WORK. BECAUSE IF THE STRATEGY- WE DON'T GET WE DON'T HAVE A STRATEGIC PLAN THAT'S WORKING RIGHT WE WOULDN'T WANT TO CONTINUE FUNDING. AS YOU GO PLAN THAT ISN'T WORKING SO WE WANNA KNOW WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. YEAH AND I'M NOT SURE BUT INSTEAD OF ALL ON THE ON EXACTLY THE LOCATION OF ALL THE PAST PROJECTS I'VE PROBABLY KNOW THEY'RE AFRAID YOU FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN. JEFF STATE FUNDING TO OF COURSE THERE'S WORK ON PRIVATE LANDS THAT HAPPENS- WITH REGARD TO FOREST HEALTH AS WELL SO- SO IT'S PROBABLY COMPLICATED TECH TO SORT OF GET THAT FULL PICTURE OF EXACTLY WHERE HISTORICAL PROJECT- BUT- CERTAINLY OF. WITH PLEASE ANYTHING THAT'S AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO YOU AS AS YOU AS WE EVALUATE. THE FINDINGS THAT THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF A PRIVATE WORK BEING DONE ON THE WORK BEING DONE THE FEDERAL LANDS. AS WELL AS THE STATE- FACILITIES AND SO WE WANT TO. TO BE ABLE TO GAUGE AS YOU SAID. THE NUMBER OF ACRES TREATED OVERLAY IT WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S BEEN SPENT AND SEE. IF WE'RE GETTING THE MOST BANG FOR OUR BUCK SO I APPRECIATE THAT THE- BUT THE BACK AND FORTH AND- I'LL TURN BACK UP TO THE CHECK. THANK YOU AT- SPEAKING OF- OTHER OPPORTUNITIES- AND NEEDS WHEN IT COMES TO WELFARE PREVENTION THERE IS CURRENTLY A DEBATE GOING ON IN CONGRESS- AROUND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR EXACTLY THAT PURPOSE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM- SPEAKERS- WHO MAY HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF- OUR LOBBYING EFFORTS TO SEE TO IT THAT- THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIA- ARE MAXIMIZED. IN THAT REGARD IT'S- I DON'T THINK THE SECRET TO ANYBODY THAT- THERE'S A- AT A SIGNIFICANT LACK OF- INVESTMENT IN WILDFIRE PREVENTION ON ALL FRONTS- CALIFORNIA'S NOW STEPPED UP IN A IN IN A BIG WAY AND OUR- FEDERAL PARTNERS REALLY NEED TO AS WELL THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS. RIGHT NOW IN THIS MOMENT SO I WOULD LIKE TO. HEAR ABOUT THAT I DON'T KNOW IF- IS KIRSTEN IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THAT BUT- I WANT TO GET IT OUT THERE SO THAT- OUR OTHER. PRESENTERS COULD ADDRESS IT. THANK YOU YEAH I'VE SEEN I'VE- BEEN TRYING TO TRACK A LITTLE BIT THE FUNDING BOTH AND THE BILL BACK BETTER AND OF COURSE- YOU KNOW THE AT THE OTHER IN THE OTHER AND- THE INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN AND- I. YET THERE IS IF THERE IS- FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE AND I THINK- AGAIN YOU KNOW THERE'S OF COURSE SOME CONTINUING NEGOTIATIONS AND CONGRESS AND EXACTLY HOW THIS WILL PLAY OUT I'M NOT SURE AND I'M NOT. I'M NOT REALLY AND- I'VE BEEN TRACKING THE STATE'S LOBBYING EFFORTS SPECIFICALLY SO MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THAT THE NEXT PANEL COULD COVER. THAT MAKES SENSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR- PRISON MR GALLAGHER YOU HAVE A OKAY WE HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION FOR YOU- SO ON THE EARLY ACTION A IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY PROJECTS BUT DO YOU DO YOU HAVE AN IDEA OF HOW MANY ACRES ARE IDENTIFIED IN THOSE COMMITTED. PROJECTS WE HAVE A LIST THE POINT I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER OF ACRES- I CAN SEE IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION COULD PROVIDE- CERTAINLY HAPPY THAT TO- REACH OUT TO THEM OR YOU COULD ASK THE- STATE IF THEY HAVE THAT I KNOW THAT WILL BE PART OF THE REPORTING SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- THAT WILL BE FORTHCOMING I JUST DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY THAT THEY HAVE AT THIS POINT- YEAH I CAN ASK THE NEXT PANEL I JUST WANT TO SEE IF YOU HAD HAD. A COMPILATION OF THAT- AND THEN. THE OFFICE YET UNPRECEDENTED FUNDING- THAT WE'VE BROUGHT ONLINE- AND THAT'S THE REALLY GOOD NEWS I THINK BUT BUT I THINK THE REAL THEME HERE IS THE URGENCY OF THE SITUATION AND THE NEED TO REALLY GET- THIS FUEL REDUCTION MANAGEMENT- PROJECTS MOVING. AND EXPEDITING THEM- BECAUSE WE WANT TO AVOID THE NEXT PARADISE. YOU KNOW THE NEXT BERRY CREEK THE NEXT GREENVILLE- SO URGENCY AND SPEED. N. AS IN THE NARROW WINDOW THAT WE HAVE. WITH LONGER FIRE SEASONS NEED TO DO THIS WORK. YOU KNOW YES STARTING IN NOVEMBER. YOU KNOW GOING INTO THE INTO THE SPRING AND THEN YOU HAVE YOU KNOW WINTER MONTHS IT MAKES IT HARD- SO WE HAVE THIS NARROW WINDOW TO GET. THIS WORK DONE- AND WHEN WE BROUGHT THIS UP ABOUT THE NEED TO STREAMLINED PROCESS SEES THE ADMINISTRATION OFTEN POINTS TO THE CAL B. T. P. PROGRAM AS- WELL THAT'S THE- THAT'S THE PROGRAM THAT'S REALLY GOING TO. SPEED THROUGH AN STREAMLINED SEQUEL ANOTHER PROCESSES TO MAKE THESE PROJECTS HAPPEN. SO IF I COULD JUST ASK YOU HOW OFTEN IS THAT PROP THAT PROGRAM BEEN USED. FOR THESE PROJECTS HAS IT ACTUALLY RESULTED IN A STREAMLINED PROCESS. FOR THEM AND HOW MANY ACRES HAS THAT PROGRAM ACTUALLY. HELP TREAT IN AN EXPEDITED WAY IF THERE IS SUCH AN EXPEDITED PROCESS. YES THAT'S A RELATIVELY NEW PROGRAM THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS LAUNCHED AND SO IT'S ONE THAT IT HASN'T BEEN USED AS AS WE DID AS WE TRY TO LOOK INTO THIS A LITTLE BIT SINCE THE LAST HEARING WEARING THEIR THIS ISSUE WAS ALSO RAISED I'M STILL HAVEN'T BEEN USED- VERY. VERY WIDESPREAD WAY I THINK IT'S MAYBE ABOUT FOURTEEN PROJECT OF OUR CALL CORRECTLY ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO LOOK BACK AT MY NOTES TO DOUBLE CHECK ON THAT BUT IT'S A RELATIVELY- RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT HAVE USED IT AS FAR PROUD BECAUSE IT IS SO NEW- WE DIDN'T FIND CLEAR YOU KNOW CLEAR DATA SHOWING THAT IT HAD AND- I THINK THAT CAN BE EXPEDITED PROJECTS BEGAN ITS IT'S VERY EARLY DAYS HERE. AND SO IT'S UNCLEAR I THINK A LOT OF ONE ONE OF THE THINGS WE HEARD WE TALK TO PEOPLE IS THAT- THERE'S SOME LEARNING CURVE ASSOCIATED WITH LEARNING AND HOW TO USE THE CAL B. T. P. KIND OF PROCESS AND HOW DID AND HOW DID YOU- SORT OF NAVIGATED A LITTLE pMORE WIDELY USED AS WELL AS- MORE HELPFUL IN EXPEDITING PROJECTS- IN THE COMING YEARS BUT THEY'RE SORT OF IT'S SORT OF TBG ON THAT EXACTLY HOW EXACTLY HOW HOPEFUL IT WILL BE AT THIS POINT. THERE ARE PROJECTS THAT WE CAN GET INFORMATION FOR A LOT OF HIS PROJECTS- BASICALLY WHAT WE CAN GATHER WITH THAT THOSE PROJECTS GENERALLY WOULDN'T HAVE USED UP DONE A FULL ER ANYWAY A LOT OF THOSE WOULD HAVE DONE TO BE MITIGATED TACK OR SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT WAS SIMPLER SO. YOU KNOW AGAIN AND CAL BTP MAY SAVE SOME TIME FOR MORE COMPLICATED- KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESS OR LIKE THE- BERMAN PROCESS MAYBE LESS SO IF PROJECTS WERE SMALLER AND ABLE TO USE- A CERTAIN ALREADY MORE AND STREAMLINED PROCESS SO IT PROBABLY DEPENDS ON THE PROJECT ALSO AGAIN IT'S EARLY DAYS TO SEE BUT WE DIDN'T SEE I'M AT THIS POINT A LOT OF A. LOT OF EVIDENCE ON I'M NOT. AND- SORRY YOUR QUESTION WITH THE EIGHT TREATED I DON'T HAVE THAT NOW RIGHT- SO I HAVE ADD TO CHECK AND IF I COULD GET. TO YOU ON THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT WILL MOVE ON TO OUR- REMAINING PANELISTS NOW AND I THINK WE HAVE- TO LET'S SEE. HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE AFTER ALL THE REMAINING PANELS OKAY SO WE HAVE SIX REMAINING PEOPLE AND I THINK WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS HERE FROM- ALL OF THEM AND THEN- THEY'LL STICK AROUND TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AFTER ALL THE PRESENTATIONS OF BEEN MADE. SO WE WILL- PROCEED NOW TO HEAR FROM. JESSICA MORSE FROM THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM- AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IT'S REALLY AN HONOR TO BE HERE WITH ALL OF YOU TODAY AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP IN WORKING WITH US ON THE AYE TACKLING A WILDFIRE CRISIS AT SCHEDULE I'M NOT SURE PRESENTATION NEED TO DATE CODES IN THE SKIES. THE CHECK HE ASKED PERSPECTIVE ON THIS YEAR'S WILDFIRES- A LITTLE BIT OF INSIGHT INTO STRATEGY BEHIND OUR INVESTMENTS AND ALSO BREAK OUT- OUR APPROACH TO WILDFIRE RESILIENCE AND THAT'S BEEN THE BULK OF THE TIME TALKING THREE WHO ARE INVESTMENT ALONG THE LINES OF THE STRATEGIES OF THE RESULTS WERE STARTING. TO SEE. THANK ASSURE COMPLIANCE. BACKGROUND AS ALL YOU KNOW EVERY CALIFORNIA AND HAS BEEN DRAMATICALLY IMPACTED BY THE WILDFIRE CRISIS FROM LOSING COMMUNITIES AND HOMES I'M TO HAVE A LOVED ONE IS DISPLACED TO I'M CHOKING ON THE SMOKE COMING INTO OUR COMMUNITIES EVERY POLICY IN CALIFORNIA IS ALSO BEING IMPACTED BY THE FIRES- IN A WHEN YOU THAT'S UNPRECEDENTED- THE DIXIE FIRE AND THE CALIBER FIRE IN THE TAMARACK FIRE ALL BURN IN CALIFORNIA'S UPPER WATERSHEDS WE HAVE FIRES OVER THE LAST TWO SEASONS THAT DEVASTATED BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY PERCENT- OF OUR LARGE JOINTS WELL YEP POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE SEEN- IT THESE FIRES IMPACTING. AT AN ENTIRE WATERSHED SCALE THE DIXIE FIRE FOR EXAMPLE IS THE LARGEST SINGLE- BUT WILDFIRE IN STATE HISTORY AND IT BURNED ST THREE THE FEATHER RIVER WATERSHED WHICH IS THE HEADQUARTERS FOR THE STATE WATER PROJECT I WE HAD NEVER HAD IN STATE HISTORY FIRES BURN UP AND OVER THE PLANET CREST OF THE SIERRA NEVADA UNTIL THIS YEAR IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE IT HAPPENED TWICE WITH THE DIXIE FIRE AND THE CALDOR FIRE. WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT THESE FIRES ARE DRAMATICALLY IMPACTING CALIFORNIA'S WATERSHEDS- WE ARE WITH 60% OF OUR WATER COMES FROM THIS YEAR NEVADA AND AS YOU CAN SEE- IN THE HSTORICAL FIRE A PERSON THAT REGION SINCE NINETEEN TWENTY- THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE FIRE SEASONS ARE UNPARALLELED- INDICATING THAT WE ARE NOW SEEN OUR THE COMPOUNDING. OF CLIMATE CHANGE ARE WE ARE WE ARE HAVING CATASTROPHIC FIRES WE'RE HAVING HEAT DROUGHT RIGHT CONDITIONS- ON TOP OF DENSE FUEL LOADS READ EXTREME FIRE BEHAVIOR WHICH BURNS NIGHT AT HIGH SEVERITY I HAVE TO THE DIXIE FIREBIRD HYSAN WHICH MADE IT BIRDS OUT- THE AKALA AND DOWN INTO THAT TOP SOIL NOT ACTUALLY WENT FURTHER EXACT STROKING. BY BY OUR WATERSHEDS SO WE'RE NOW SEEING WITH THE FIRE CRISIS ARE COMPOUNDING CLIMATE CYCLES- AND ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS CLIMATE CHANGE THERE. SOME HOPE THEY'LL BE BECAUSE WHAT WE KNOW THAT ON THE- ACROSS FOR WHAT. WE CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THE STRUCTURE. OF THE FOREST YOU BECOME YEAH AND VIRUS. EVEN IN THE HIGH DRIVE CAN. ON THAT WE ARE EXT. SO I I'VE SHOWN YOU RIGHT HERE ON AN OVERLY GOT FOREST WHERE YOU GET LATTER FEW UP INTO THE UPPER TREE CANOPY. BURNS OUT THE ANTI WATER- WHERE IS A YOU GET FORCE INTO. I THEN THE FIRE IN I IN LOW BIRDS UNDER BECAUSE FOR. SO AKAL SHE'S- I FINE A DAY. AND IT'S PROTECT FOR TO COLOR THING CAL. BUT THERE ARE TOOLS THAT WE ARE BRINGING FROM THAT SHE TO BE ABLE TO HELP US. THE INCREASE IN CRIME CHANGE SYMPORTER MEMBER WE CANNOT DO IT ALL. FIFTY SO PERCENT OF. FOR LAND ARE AND MANAGED BY THE STATE GOVERNMENT 3% ARE OWNED BY THE STATE AND 40% ARE PRIVATELY HELD. LAST SUMMER IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY TWENTY WE ARE SHE HAS SIGNED. A SHARED. FREMANTLE THE FEDERAL. THAT A LOT TERM. BASED YEARS. FOR ACHIEVING CALL ME. CALL RIZZO- FOR TWO. LAST THIS ARE EARLY YEAR. THROUGH COUPLE. AND WORK STATE AND OUR FEDERAL. HOW RELEASE BEAT WHILE FORCED RISEN AT PLAN FOR MORE. FORCED RESILIENCE TASK. THIS REALLY OUT THIS. SOLUTION AND THE TO ACTIONS WE TO TAKE. WHERE THE US SERVICE OUR FEDERAL PARTNER AND LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS TO BE ABLE TO TACKLE THIS CLIMATE CRISIS AT SCALE. OUR INVESTMENT OF ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THE PHILS CALIFORNIA'S COMMITMENT TO THAT SHARED STEWARDSHIP- THOSE TARGETS AND GOALS ONE U. FOREST SERVICE AND IT'S- AND WE ARE. EAGERLY ANTICIPATING THE INCREASE DOLLARS FROM THE U. S. FOREST SERVICE SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO INVEST- WITH ICE AT THIS SCALE. SO WE NEED TO TACKLE THIS CRISIS TOGETHER AND WE ARE STARTING TO TACKLE THIS CRISIS AT SCALE TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS THE FIRST TIME WE SAW- DEDICATED FUNDING FOR WILDFIRE RESILIENCE IN CALIFORNIA. SB NINE A ONE AND THAT WAS A BASED BUDGET ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. THIS YEAR WE INVESTED ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS BETWEEN THE EARLY ACTION FUNDS. AND AT THE BUDGET YEAR DOLLARS AND THIS CREATED A HUGE FOUNDATION FOR US TO BE ABLE TO START TACKLING THIS CRISIS AT GAIL. EARLY ACTION DOLLARS WERE CRUCIAL WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR THE LEADERSHIP AND INNOVATION OF THE LEGISLATURE RECORDING EMERGENCY APPROPRIATION IN PLACE. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WILDFIRES DO NOT CAUSE OR THE BUDGET CYCLE AND STILL GETTING US THOSE. EARLY IN US TO GIVE THANK. AT LAST A BASS I. SCALE THE SHOVEL READY PROJECTS TYPE. THAT WERE READY TO GO OUT THE YOU'RE ON THE GO AND YET MOVING SIXTY PROJECTS THAT LARGE WITHIN A MONTHS. ALSO ENABLED US TO START A NEW. SINCE YOU'RE THE ONE WE GOT THE DOLLAR COMMITTED YET SUCH AS I'M NOT ALLOWED TO GET US MONTH START. TO GET THOSE CROSS ROLE. SO THOSE IN THINGS LIKE- BUT CLIMATE. FONG TO GET WHICH LOAN THE- BUSINESS LOAN IN THIS SPACE- IT ALLOW US TO JUMP HARDENING DEFENSIVE SPACE. PROGRAM IN ADDITION. OUR THE ACROSS THE STREET TO DELIVER WHILE RESILIENCE. WE ALSO THEN. ON IN BEING HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS ROUND UP ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION THOSE WERE IN. IN THAT ARE BRING US TO A ARTS STE. I'M THESE ARE GONNA BE LARGER. AND THE ALSO INVEST IN SOME OF THE STRUCTURE- AREAS THAT ARE GOING TO ALLOW US DELIVER RESILIENCE COULD. IN THE LONG TERM. BEING LED BY LOCAL COLLABORATIVE GROUPS- SO THAT WE ARE NOT TAKING A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. TO THE STATE I'M AND ALSO REALLY JUMP STARTING THE BUSINESS SECTOR AGAIN. OR TAKING THE WOODY BIOMASS COMING OUT OF THESE FUEL REDUCTION PROJECTS AND TURNING THAT INTO SOMETHING MORE USEFUL THAN OPEN PILE BURNING. WE STAR ALREADY HAVE SEEN- EARLY RESULTS FROM THESE EARLY ACTION DOLLARS. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE L. A. L. MENTIONED WE AMBASSADOR EARLY ACTION DOLLARS ANTICIPATING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE- A JUMP START ON A YEAR- THAT MOST OF THESE PROJECTS TAKE A YEAR TO START TO FINISH. BUT I WAS AMAZED. THAT ARE I'M CONSERVANCY STATE ENTITIES CAL FIRE WORKED INCREDIBLY HARD AND GOT SOME OF THESE PROJECTS STARTED AND SOME OF THEM FINISHED IN RECORD TIME- THIS IS CORRECT PICTURE OF THE PROJECT. NOW BEEN DONE BY THE STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY DOWN ON THE SANTA BARBARA AREA. AND WHEN I ALSO FIRE- HIT AN AREA THAT THE STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY HAD WATCHED A GRAZING PROJECT THIS SPRING WITH THOSE EARLY ACTION DOLLARS. YOU CAN SEE THAT IT ACTUALLY SAVE THE PRESERVE AND- AND STOP BURNING THE AREA THAT WAS BURNED OUT WAS ABOUT THREE FEET OF MUSTARD. I'M ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT FENCE LINE- ON A NEIGHBORING PROPERTY THAT HAD BEEN CLEARED OUT SO THIS- EARLY ACTION INVESTMENT ACTUALLY CAME INTO PLAY THIS WILDFIRE SEASON WE SAW THE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE YOU SOME OF THEIR EARLY ACTION DOLLARS. UNTILMARCH- OVER FIFTY PROJECTS- AND THEY WERE ABLE TO PICK SOME OF THOSE DOLLARS AFTER THE CALDOR FIRE JUST STOP ROSHAN AND PROTECT. REALLY BAD. SO THESE DOLLARS ARE MAKING A HUGE IMPACT. I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO BREAK DOWN THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING IN A WILDFIRE RESILIENCE WHAT IS WILD BECAUSE LIKE ACTUALLY LOOK LIKE. FOR COMMUNITIES. AND- AND HOW ARE WE. INTERACTION BEST I SCALE SO THERE REALLY THREE. FINE A WILDFIRE RESILIENCE THAT GO. AND WE NEED TO BE IN. IN AROUND COMMUNITY I L. TO BE ABLE TO START HAVING- I'M REALLY OUR CA. NOT JUST YOUR BUT- I'M IN THIS AGE OF CRIME CHANGE SO INVEST ALMOST THREE FRONT FIRST REALLY UP. LAW LAND. WHERE WE ARE WORST. THE NASH CHOIR A CALL SHE TO LANDSCAPES SO WHEN IS BY MISSION. WHEN THEY'RE ON IS A LIE STRIKE. THAT IT. AT ITS WITHIN ITS- NO AND IT'S RIGHT FIRE RETURN INTO. SO THAT IT. HAS A RESEARCH THE IMPACT ON THE FOLLOW. RATHER A DENNIS ONE. THE NEXT AREA IS AROUND CAN. IN THAT Y. LAND IN. THIS IS WEARING AGAINST FUEL BREAKS AND IN. FIRE FIRE THAT TACTIC ADVANTAGE TO BE ABLE TO SLOW FIRE ON ME AND- FIRES. OR STAY A FIRE IF THEY HAVE THAT A BILL. I'M THE LAST AREA IS IN IN HER. INSIDE COMMITTEE. SO THAT ALL. AND DEFENSE SPACE. WE'RE WE ARE HELPING COMMUNITY. BILL LAST ROUND YOU IN- SO THAT THOSE WILDLAND FIRE THEN JOE BECOME URBAN IN. WE ALSO INVITE IN COURT PRINCE AS WELL TO ENSURE THAT ACROSS ALL THREE FRONTS WILD RESILIENCE WERE ACTUALLY MAKE AN IMPACT THAT IS LONG TERM I'M FOR THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS FOR. THAT IS ALSO DRIVING UP ON MY WORK AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITIES AND IS REALLY ANCHORED IN REGIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND SO INVESTMENTS IN THESE FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS ARE ALSO REALLY CRUCIAL TO ENSURING THAT WE ARE SCALING UP OUR EFFORTS FOR WILDFIRE. IT'S WHAT'S EXCITING IS THAT WE'RE STARTING TO SEE EARLY IMPACTS AND THAT HE'S INVESTMENTS WE'RE MAKING ACROSS THE RESPONSE OF FIRE RESILIENCE ARE PAYING OFF. I'M AND THE CALIBER FIRE IS A REALLY GREAT EXAMPLE I'M AS OLD YOU KNOW THAT FIRE THAT BURNED UP HIGHWAY FIFTY FROM POLLOCK PINES. OVER THE ECHO SUMMIT OPEN OVER THE CREST OF THIS YEAR AT DEFINITELY SHE WILL- AND THE DOW INTO THE TAHOE. AND WHY IS- BUT I YOU KNOW CASH MAY A FIRE WE'RE GETTING HIGH. WHAT WE SAW THAT THE INTERVENTIONS THAT WERE ON THE GROUND FLAYED ALIVE ROLE FROM A PROGRAM CALLED FIRE DOCTORS. ALONG HIGHWAY FIFTY THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE BY THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT THROUGH FUNDING FROM CAL FIRE YOUR NEVADA CONSERVANCY AND YOUR SUPPORT SERVICE- THAT ALLOW THE COMMUNITIES APOLOGIZED COMMUNITIES AND HOMES TO BE SAVED WE ALSO SAW A PRESCRIBED FIRE OUTSIDE OF KIRKWOOD CALLED THE PEOPLE'S BURKE. AT MAX WHEN THE CALIBER FIRE HIT THAT AREA ACTUALLY STEER AROUND THE CABLES FIRE ON GIVING FIREFIGHTERS A TACTICAL ADVANTAGE- NEED THE COMMUNITY OF KIRKWOOD SAID THOSE LANDSCAPE SCALE INVESTMENTS DO YOU HAVE A BIG IMPACT. ON THE BEHAVIOR OF THESE MEGA FIRES WE ALSO SAW FUEL BREAKS AROUND- THE AREAS OF. MYERS AND CHRISTMAS BALLY HOW IMPACT AS- I'M SO THE PHONE I'M SURE YOU RIGHT HERE THIS CRAP THANK THE GROUND. IF YOU CAN SEE IT IS WHERE FIRE. THE ORANGE AND YELLOW IS WAY PART IN QUITE HIGH. SO THAT'S WHERE YOU GETTING THOSE HUNDRED PLUS FLAME LINKS AND THIS VEHICLE AREA. I'M WHICH AS YOU CAN SEE ALL THE NAY. THOSE ARE WORK OF FUEL BREAKS FUEL. THAT HAD BEEN MADE. BY I DO FOR STATE AND PARTNERS FIRE. THANKS IT. TAHOE REGIONAL PLANNING. THE U. S. SERVICE TO PARKS I'M IN A ROW THAT TOPPLED. FIREFIGHTER ON THE GROUND REPORT THAT WE- THOSE THAT WERE THAT WERE FIFTY PLUS WHAT FLAME LIKE LET FIFTEEN STORY BUILDING. WHEN THEY THOSE FUEL BRAKES ANY THE STREET IF YOU'RE BREAKING AN AREA JUST KIND AND NOW. TREE. IT DROPPED TO FIFTEEN IN SOME DE TO NEAR. SO FIRE WERE ABLE TO TAKE ITS- OUT IN THOSE AREAS COMMUNITY AND ALSO DONE A GREAT JOB ON DEFENSIBLE SPACE PARDON. AND EARLY IN WHICH- GIVING FOR. AN OPERA TO A STAND- AND PROTECT THOSE CAN. AND HOME WERE LOTS IN THE TAHOE BASIN. SO WE KNOW THESE IN. WERE SO I WANT GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW WE ARE INVESTING ACROSS THOSE THREE FRIENDS OUT. OF RESILIENCE- BECAUSE THIS PROGRAM THAT WE'RE INVESTING IN IT IS ACROSS FORTY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS ACROSS OVER TWENTY DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS SO THERE'S HUGE PARTNERSHIPS ENGAGED HERE AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF TAILOR PROGRAMS. TO MEET THE DIFFERENT LANDSCAPES- AND GROUPS THAT ARE IMPACTING CALIFORNIA- THAT WE NEED TO BE ENGAGED TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THIS RESILIENT LANDSCAPES- AND FIRE RESILIENCE ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE SO ON THAT LANDSCAPE LEVEL CRIMES- THERE'S LOTS OF TOOLS THAT WEREN'T. BURKE MASTICATION ANY PRESCRIBED FIRE THEY OFTEN ALL GO TOGETHER- BUT THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THESE PROJECTS WORKING IN V. EIGHT- MORE COMPLEX FIRE OUTSIDE OF THE TOWN OF QUINCY- I'M- HERE TO. CONSERVANCY HAD INVESTED IN YOUR ACTION PROJECTS- UNDERNEATH THOSE GREEN TREES YOU SEE AND- ARE. NEED MORE COMPLEX FIRE HIT IT WAS CLEARLY BURNING AT HIGH SEVERITY UNTIL IT HIT THAT FUELED BY A MODIFICATION AREA WITHOUT COURSE HAD BEEN BENT. AND FIRED GROUNDED OUT AND BURNED UNDERNEATH THE TREE CANOPY THAT'S THE GOAL WE'RE GOING FOR IS TO BE ABLE TO HOWEVER COURSE STAND OUT. SO THAT WHEN THE FIRE BURNS THROUGH A BIRDS UNDERNEATH AND THE TREES- AND THE ECOLOGY IS LEFT STANDING- AS OPPOSED TO THE HIGH SEVERITY THAT YOU SEE ON THE LEFT. ARE EARLY ACTION DOLLARS ARE HAVING. THIS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE NEED TO DIRECTLY- STATE OAKLAND TO BE STATE PARKS. OFFICIAL WHY. HAVE BEEN GREAT FROM FIRE. TO BE ABLE TO YOU FEEL ACTION. ON NEARLY. THE EARLY ACTION DOLLARS AND THE BY YEAR TO. NOW CREEK TO PROBE. MORE EFFICIENT WHILE ANSTIEG PARKS MISSION WHILE MUCH NEARLY REDUCTION- AROUND THEIR AREAS AND STATE PARKS- IS LAUNCHING PROGRAMS THAT ARE DOING ANY WORK INCLUDING EVER ON CALAVERAS BIG TREES TO PROTECT SME OF OUR OUR MONARCH CIRCLE YES. I'M IN THAT AREA AS WELL I'M SHOWING YOU A PICTURE OF WHAT THE FUEL LOADING LOOKS LIKE- BEFORE. IN THERE. AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE INVESTING IN THESE RESILIENT LANDSCAPES SO FORCED HEALTH GRANTS FROM CAL FIRE. DRAMATICALLY SCALED UP- WE HAVE PROGRAMS FOR SMALL FOREST LANDOWNERS THE FORCED IMPROVEMENT FOR SMALL LANDOWNERS- SUMMED AND ACRONYMS THE FACT OR AT. AND THAT PROGRAM FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IS A HUGE SCALE INVESTMENT- BECAUSE MALL COURSE OF LANDOWNERS ACTUALLY MAKE UP ABOUT 26% SO THOSE ARE FOLKS THAT HAVE FIFTY ACRES ONE HUNDRED ACRES A THOUSAND ACRES- SO THE SMALLER PLOTS. AND THESE GRANTS HELP THEM TREAT THEIR LANDSCAPE SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THIS PATCHWORK IMPACT I'M AND INSTEAD ARE HAVING CONTIGUOUS HEALTHY FORESTS IN THESE AREAS. I'M MORE ALSO INVESTING IN OUR FORCE OUR REFORESTATION NURSERY ARE URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAM AND LAUNCHING A NEW PROGRAM TO INVEST. IN A TRIBALLY LED INITIATIVE- THAT IS PARTNERING WITH THE INDIGENOUS- TRIBAL STEWARDSHIP COUNCIL. THAT IS PART OF OUR REGIONAL FORTUNE. RAMPS THIS IS A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR PROBE. THAT ALLOWS TRIED TO TELL WHAT THEY WANT TO DO ON THE LAN. I'M IN A TRIBE LED. I HER PROGRAM I'M THAT THEY CAN HAVE TO THEN COMPETE FOR ALL OF OUR THERE. L. A. TO CAN FOR OF OUR GREAT BUT THIS IS. A DRAMATIC TRIBE PROGRAM AND WERE SEEN- AND TO. WITH THEM AND THEN THE HUNDREDS OF FIVE BELOW THAT ALL TODAY THE STATE. DEPARTMENT WHILE PRO. SO THOSE LATE SCALE INVESTMENT ARE INVESTING ACROSS OWNERSHIP TYPES AND- AND LAND TYPES. WE ARE ACTUALLY ACHIEVING IT CAN TO AND- BECAUSE WHILE. ARE NOT. AT BOUNDARIES. JERRY WAS INVESTMENTS CAN YOU SO THIS ISN'T A OF KIND OF A GRAPHIC OF WHAT SHE DID FEEL LOOK LIKE- AND IT'S BEEN OUT- ROAD. OFTEN IT TO FIREFIGHTERS IN A VACUUM IT CREATES A SAFE PLACE FOR FIREFIGHTERS TO TAKE A STAND AND CREATE THOSE TACTICAL ADVANTAGES DURING A WILDFIRE SO WE ARE INVESTING IN CALIFORNIA ARE CONTINUING THEIR INCREDIBLE WORK ON THE FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS ARE INCREDIBLE TOOLS TO GET- LOCAL COUNTIES FIRE SAFE COUNCILS- TO BE ABLE TO DO. ARE NOT JUST FUEL BREAKS BUT ALSO FOUGHT HARD NAY DEFENSIBLE SPACE WORK- AND THEN THE POOREST REPORT PROGRAM THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS THE EXECUTE A LOT OF THE SKILL BREAKS- AND FORCE HEALTH PROJECT IN. AND AROUND COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE LAST COMING AND HOME- THIS IS WHERE. PEOPLE DO TO SPACE THERE MAKE IT EASY TO DO THEIR HOMES- DURING FIRE AND AS WE KNOW HOMES. ON THE INSIDE OUT DURING A WILDFIRE SO EMBERS GETTING IN THROUGH FOR ROOF SO EDUCATE HOME- AND GIVING THEM THE TOOLS TO DO HOME GARDENING WORK IS REALLY CRUCIAL SO WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS. I'M INCLUDING THIS FIRE PREVENTION GRANTS I MENTIONED EARLIER- THAT THEY ARE OFTEN HELPING ON THE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH WE ARE INVESTING IN YOUSIF WILDLAND FIRE FIGHT AT UC FIRE ADVISOR. PROGRAM THROUGH THE UC EXTENSION PROGRAM HAS BEEN HELPING OUT WITH THE MASTER GARDENERS PROGRAM ON DEFENSIBLE I FACED AS DISPENSABLE SPACE. I THE CALL STEVE- WHERE THEY'RE HELPING PEOPLE DO. OR DEFENSE SPACE HOMES I'M AARON I'M ALSO ENSURING THAT FIRE WAYS COMMUNITIES FIRE SAFE COUNCILS. HAVE EXPERTS TO BE ABLE TO LEAN ON TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE INTEGRATING THE BEST SCIENCE AROUND HOME HARDENING DEFENSIBLE SPACE LANDSCAPE- PROTECTION THAT THEY'RE DOING- WE ALSO HAVE INVESTMENTS A DEFENSIBLE SPACE INSPECTORS- SURGED BACK PROGRAM WITH THIS BUDGET YEAR DOLLARS AN EARLY ACTION. TO GET OUT AND WORK WITH HOMEOWNERS I'M AND THEN A NEW INITIATIVE WHICH WAS A LOW INCOME DEFENSIBLE SPACE PROGRAM SO THOSE HOMEOWNERS THAT THE EDUCATION TOOLS I'M ARE AND NOT TO GET THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT- THIS IS A TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT THAT WE ARE PARTNERING. WITH FEMA- TO UNLOCK SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FROM FEMA FOR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR PILOTS TO BE ABLE TO DO DIRECT INTERVENTIONS FOR HOME TURNING FOR LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS AND THAT PROGRAM IS LAUNCHING. ON WE'RE ALSO INVESTING ACROSS THE STRUCTURAL AREAS I MENTIONED SO. I JUST WENT THROUGH THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE THOSE THREE FUNDS HAVE DIRECTIONS BILLIONS WHERE WE'RE WE'RE LOWERING THE FUEL INTENSITY AND THAT FIRE INTENSITY ON THE LANDSCAPE RETURNING THOSE NATURAL FIRE ECOLOGY IS WE'RE INVESTING AROUND COMMUNITIES. FOR THAT- SO THAT FIREFIGHTERS HAVE THE TACTICAL ADVANTAGES AND COMMUNITIES HAVE SAFE ESCAPE ROUTES DURING WILDFIRES AND THEN INVESTING INSIDE OF COMMUNITIES TO MAKE HOMES LESS IGNITION PROBLEM WHEN THOSE BIG NUMBERS ARE COMING IN. ON SO THE LAST AREAS ARE REGIONAL INVESTMENTS AND ALSO SITES IN BUSINESS AND I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH SO WE HAVE ALISON JOLLY ON THE PANEL TODAY WHO'S GOING TO GO INTO A LOT OF DATA. ABOUT THE REGIONAL FOREST AND FIRE CAPACITY SHOWGROUND. PROGRAM REALLY ENCOURAGED- MOST OF OUR INVESTMENTS SO WE ARE INVESTING INVEST IN- THE REPORT CONTRABASS IN DISTRESS LOCAL COLLAB. I'M THAT ARE STE GRAY DOLLAR LIKE THOSE FORCED AND BY PREVENT GRANT DOLLARS THAT BIG TICKET ITEMS AND ALSO FOR STATE GERMAN DOLLARS. THE GO TO. INTO WELCOME FUNDING OUR ANCHOR KERR. IN REGIONAL FOR FIRE TO PASS PROBE THE BUT YEAR DAHLE. GOT WHY INVEST. IN THIS REGIONAL EMPIRE COULD PROGRAM SO WE HAVE SORT OF LARGE REGIONS ACROSS THE STATE WHICH ARE CONSERVANCY ANCHOR WE DON'T HAVE SOME BREACH- AND- WHICH ARE OFTEN ASKED OF THE CONSERVATIVES WILL THAT KIND OF BREAK OUT AND THEN WE HAVE A LOCAL COLLABORATIVE. LIKE RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT FOR THE NOTE NORTH COAST PARTNERSHIPS THAT MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS I'LL GIVE YOU A COUPLE EXAMPLES SO THAT THIS ISN'T QUITE SO ABSTRACT SO EARLY ACTION DOLLARS WE'RE REALLY IMPACTFUL WHERE THEY INVESTED. IN A REGIONAL COLLABORATIVES THAT ALREADY BEEN SET UP UNDER THIS REGIONAL FORCING FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM SO THIS IS AN EXAMPLE FROM THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY- WHERE THEY HAD BEEN INVESTING IN A REGIONAL STRATEGY IN THEIR AREA AND SO WHEN THEY GOT EARLY ACTION DOLLARS IT COMPLEMENTED CALIFORNIA FORCED HEALTH GRANTS- AND THEY WERE ABLE TO YOU KNOW. DO YOU ASK YOUR ACTION ALONG HIGHWAY ONE OH ONE WITH THE EARLY. ACTION DOLLARS. TRINA'S SOME OF FINE. THEY SAT EARLY. PROTECTION PROGRAM WHICH THEY HAVE DEPLOYED AS EARLY AS FOURTH OF JULY. I'M AND WE'RE IN TO STOP. SIMILARLY FIRE- AND- THEY WERE ABLE TO ALSO THAT READ INVESTMENT ACROSS THESE LANDS SCALE. AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE FAR LEFT GEORGINA'S LOADING. AND HELP- RESTORATION. I'M ANOTHER GREAT EXAMPLE IS THE SAN DIEGO CONSERVANCY INVESTED IN A PARTNERSHIP THAT ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED WHEN HE ASKED SAN DIEGO RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT. SCHERING YOUR MAP. OF THE SAN DIEGO AREA WITH ALL OF THE DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS THAT'S WHY HE'S REGIONAL INVESTMENTS ARE SO CRITICAL BECAUSE IF WE ALLOW IT TO EACH JURISDICTION OPERATE IN A SILO. THAT PATCHWORK AND WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO A FIRE WOULD JUST BIRD STREET UNIT PATCHWORK ON BY A COHESIVE APPROACH ANCHORED BY THE SAN DIEGO RESOURCE CONSERVATION DISTRICT. AND PARTNERED. WITH THE SAN DIEGO CONSERVANCY. YEAH FUNDING PROMISED FORCES PASS PRO. TO DESIGN OUR REGION STRATEGY SEVERAL YEARS AGO I'M A THEY ALSO WILL GIVE AND STAFF AND- TO BE A TO SEE UP THAT REGIONAL STRATEGY AS WELL. SO THAT WE ARE ACTION DOLLAR TEEN IN THE SAN CA WERE IN TO BOTH COME IN AND MAKING THE- IN LAST. IS REALLY TRIED ARE ALSO REALLY CREWS. TO OUR SPECIAL PARTNERSHIP WE ARE USING THESE AS A JOB GREEN ARROW THAT SAYS GOVERNMENT INVEST. HERE YOU SEEN SAN DIEGO THE FOR SERVICE ALSO MEETING BACK. THIS REGIONAL. WHICH GETS US SOME WORKING. IN ACROSS THE- REGARD OF WHEN. TYPE AND SO AND WE ARE SEEING THIS REPEATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND OUR EXPANDED INVESTMENTS IN THE REGIONAL FORCING FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAMS ARE REALLY ANCHORING THOSE INVESTMENTS SO THAT WE WILL SEE THIS AS- THE NORM- I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE AND THIS'LL BE STUDENT. LAST FIVE MINUTES HERE- TO TALK THROUGH THE OTHER AREAS THAT WE'RE DRIVING ECONOMY AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT HERE SO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE WITH THESE PEOPLE ARE ACTION PROJECT IS WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE DEATH YOU ALL. ON THIS IS ALSO ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE'RE HAVING IN THAT MOST OF OUR MEALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE INVESTING IN MILL CAPACITY THAT IS- THAT THEY THEY'RE DOING POST FIRE SALVAGE SO THERE IS A LOT OF DEAD WOULD DROP CALIFORNIA AND WHAT DO YOU. THE DOESN'T HAPPEN OF BOTH. THAT EITHER WAY WILL BE. CHILD OR BE A HAZARD- IF YOU CAN SEE THIS PHOTO I'M STILL IN THE CORNER THERE JUST AS A SENSE OF SCALE. THIS IS ONE OF MANY SLASH PILES ON THE IN AND AROUND THIS YEAR REGION- AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THEY HAVE TO GET.ENTIRE AND CHIU. DURING SOME OF THESE BIG FIRES ENSURE THAT THESE DIDN'T BECOME- HUGE. THEMSELVES AND SO CREATING. FOR THAT WOODY BIOMASS CREW. AND WE'RE TALKING AGNOSTIC BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT OF SOLUTIONS TO GET THERE BUT WE ARE INVESTING IN THE CLIMATE CATALYST FUND WHICH IS GETTING LOW INTEREST LOANS. TO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO START OUT ON MY FROM MILLS JOB MOST CROSS LAMINATED TIMBER- THE BIO. FUEL ARE PROJECTS THAT WILL CONVERT THOSE WOODY BIOMASS PILES INTO- ON THE START OF CRUDE OIL OR BIODIESEL THAT WERE CONVERTED INTO. YOU ALL OUT AND NOW WE ALLOW UP TO EIGHTEEN STORY BUILDINGS MADE OUT OF COMPRESSED- TIMBER WHICH I WHICH IS REPLACE A SCHEDULING CONFLICT. CONSTRUCTION ON EVEN MY CRIMINALS SO NOW WOULD THAT CAN BE USED- CAN I CAN ACTUALLY BE USED TO HELP MEET THE HOUSING AND- AND RECONSTRUCT SOME OF THESE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE LOST. WE'RE ALSO INVESTING IN WORKFORCE DEVELOP. ACROSS THESE AREAS FROM THE CONSERVATION CORPS- CHU A PROGRAM CALLED THE CHIPS PROGRAM WHICH WORKS WITH TRIAL. THANK YOU. IT'LL ARE. THEM THE WORK FORCE- THERE CAN NOT TO TRY ABOUT ALPINE. SOUTH KOREA READ IN A POINT JUST THIS FUEL PRO AWAY. I'M IN SO AND ALSO COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND ALL YOU KNOW. JEWISH THAT WE ARE CREE CAREER PATHS. ARE COMING IN AS YOU'LL SCORE. AND ABLE TO. I'M THE ATTIC FROM IN THE ENTIRE WE JUST DOLLAR AT THIS CRISIS WITHOUT INVEST IN THE BUSINESSES TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE THESE PROGRAMS AND THE WORK FORCE TO PEOPLE TO BE ON THE GROUND OR DURING THE WORK WE WOULD JUST BE DRIVING THE CAR. THE COST OF PER ACRE THE COST. ON HER HOUSE AND SO WHAT WE WANTED YOU. INVEST IN A ROBUST WORKFORCE THAT TURNS THIS FIRE CRISIS. AND YOUR CAREER OPPORTUNITIES. SO WE'RE- CROSS ALL OF THESE AREAS FROM THE CLIMB CALLOUS FUND- REALLY EXCITING PROGRAMS IN OPR I PILES PROGRAM THAT WE'VE BEEN INVESTING IN WITH A BUNCH YEAR IN OUR ACTION DOLLARS. THE AYE LET'S WOULD BE FOR. BECAUSE WHY OF THE- WE'VE BEEN HAVING IN ITS THIS WHAT HE MEANT. IS CREE A SUPPLIED CAN. SO CREATING V. I LIKE THAT WORK FOR A SAN- SURE FEET STOCKBROKER. THAT WILL BE TO GIVE OUT TWENTY YOUR CAR. I'M AWARE ARE GRAY TEAM PREVIOUS COULD ONLY ABOUT TWO HERE ONE OF EXCITING THINGS LETTER SO DE- THIS BY. IS THAT FOR A LOT OF THE PROBE. THERE'S ACTUALLY SEVEN YOUR LIFE ON THE DOLLARS WHICH MEETS. ARE THOSE THAT ARE DOING LARGE WATER SCALE STUDIES SHOWED WATERSHED SCALE PROJECTS THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY- SPENDS ATTY CAN ACTUALLY GET OUT SEVEN YEAR CONTRACT. I'M ON THE FEEDSTOCK COMING OUT I'M AND ALSO SEVEN YEAR CONTRACTS ON THE WORK FORCE SO WE CHANGED SOME OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES TO BE A STABILIZER IN THIS ECONOMY. I'M FOR THE STATE AND JUST REALLY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP IN ENABLING US TO DO THAT- SO WE'RE ALSO INVESTING IN PERMIT EFFICIENCIES- AND A REMOTE KIND OF THING. OUR THAT THAT- AND IT WE CHANGE THE COUNTY T. PIZZA NOW BE A THREE FOR ONE CONTRACT SO ARE A THREE FOR ONE PERMIT INCLUDES. THE FIRST TIME YOU HAVE SEE QUIET WATER BOARD AND DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE PERMITS- CONDENSED INTO ONE APPLICATION AND- A- TWO MONTH PROCESS ON THE GROUND. SO SO THIS IS REALLY START WE ARE REALLY STARTING TO SEE AN IMPACT ON THE GROUND AS WE'RE SCALING UP THESE EFFORTS. EVEN TALKING ABOUT PART- AND WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR THE PARTNERSHIP AND THE LEADERSHIP- THIS OF BE ATHLETIC. SHE'LL BE ABLE TO ENABLE US. TO HAVE THE TOOLS AND RE- SAYS TO MEET CRISIS I SCALE THAT. ONLY DELIVERS FOR STILL. FOR A COMMUTER SHOULD. STRONG ACCOUNT IS AND STRAW COME. AND STRONG A CALLER. FOR THE NEXT TEN. THANK YOU. THAT'S ALL. THAT'S THAT'S A LOT- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PRISON- I'M STILL I IT'S GOT TO A WHILE TO ALL OF THAT- OUR- NEXT TO SPEAKER ON THIS PANEL IS- CHIEF TOM PORTER. THE DIRECTOR OF CAL FIRE AND I JUST WANT TO SAY AND- INTRODUCING THE- CHIEF PORTER- WHO HAS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED HIS RETIREMENT- WHAT A PLEASURE IT'S BEEN TO WORK WITH YOU CHIEF- AFTER THESE- CALLED TO FEW YEARS SO I'M SURE IT SEEMS LIKE- OF A MULTITUDE OF YEARS SAID- TO YOU AT ANY TIME AS CHIEF- BUT TO ME IT'S BEEN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. BUT YOU'RE A SERVICE TO THE STATE AND EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS OF THEIR HOMES THEIR LIVELIHOODS IS- ARE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED AND- I KNOW LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO MISS YOU UP MYSELF INCLUDED. THANK YOU. NUMBER BLOOM AND- CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE AND ON ALL OF YOU MOVE THEIR PERSONAL WELL AS AS- LISTENING IN- IT HAS BEEN QUITE A RIDE AND- I AM HUMBLED TO HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE AND THANKFULLY A CHANCE TO ADDRESS ALL OF YOU TODAY AS FRIDAY WILL BE MY LAST DAY- IN STATE SERVICE ON END OF THE DAY I WILL BE HANGING UP MY BADGE AND MOVING HOME TO TAKE CARE OF PARENTS AND MOVE ON TO OTHER THINGS BUT I WILL BE THINKING OF YOU ALL- DAILY- AS THIS IS MY LIFE'S WORK. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU IN YOUR EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM- THAT I'VE SPENT A CAREER- WORKING TOWARD AN UNDERSTANDING AND ADAPTING MY OWN MANAGEMENT- THOUGHTS AND IDEAS ABOUT HOW WE- FIX THE PROBLEM. AND I HAVE TO- COMMAND IN MY TERMS RELATIVELY NEW TO THE SPACE OF FOREST MANAGEMENT AND ALL THE HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT NEEDS TO BE- UNDERTAKEN TO GET US WHERE WE NEED TO GO AND HER PRESENTATION WAS VERY VERY ON POINT WITH EVERYTHING. THAT I BELIEVE WE NEED TO DO AND IT'S PART OF OUR COLLABORATION AND ARE WORKING ON THE CROSS GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE SMARTEST BEST SCIENTISTS HELPED US TO DETERMINE WHICH WAY TO GO AND HOW TO GET THERE AND SO. WITH THAT- IT CAN'T BE UNDERSTATED THE VALUE OF THE GOVERNOR'S WILDFIRE- AND FOREST RESILIENCY TASK FORCE. THAT GROUP OF WHICH I AM A CHARTER MEMBER- IS REALLY SETTING THE COURSE WITH NINETY NINE TASKS THAT ARE IN PLACE AND WE ARE MOVING ON. MUCH OF WHICH COVERS WHAT JESSICA JUST- COVERED IN HER PRESENTATION AS WELL AS ITS DOVE TAILED INTO- PREVIOUS BUDGET REQUEST THE ONE POINT FIVE MILLION A BILLION EXCUSE ME. EASY TO MESS THAT UP WITH SOMETHING I'LL TELL YOU IN A MINUTE. BUT THE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION GALLONS OF THE- THE TASK FORCE TASKS OR DOVETAILED AND FUTURE RAFTS- THAT WE- EXPECT WILL BE- IN FUTURE BUDGETS WILL ALSO BE DOVETAILED INTO THAT PLAN. SUPER EXCITING- AND SO. COMING BACK FOR JUST A MINUTE WHY WHY AND HOW HAVE I COME TO THIS CONCLUSION. SIMPLY THIS- I COME FROM A DEEP LINE UP FOR ST STE. MY GREAT GRANDFATHER WAS IN ESTATE IN NORTH CAROLINA. HE ENTERED INTO THAT AFTER A CONVERSATION WITH GIFFORD PINCHOT HE LEFT HIS SURGICAL BUSINESS HE WAS A SURGICAL DOCTOR AND HE LEFT THAT BECAUSE HE BELIEVED SO MUCH IN WHAT GIFFORD PINCHOT WAS TALKING ABOUT. MULTI USE MULTI VALUE. SAVE NATURAL RESOURCES FOR THE NATIONAL GUARD. MY GREAT GRANDFATHER ENTERED THE BILTMORE FORESTRY SCHOOL IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE. EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN. IF YOU CAME TO CALIFORNIA AS THE FIRST. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FORRESTER. IN THE NIGHT IN THE EIGHTEEN NINETIES. AND SPENT SEVERAL YEARS TRANSPLANTS WERE IN BACK BETWEEN COAST TO COAST WASHINGTON DC. CALIFORNIA AND HIS HIS ASSIGNMENT WAS TO SURVEY THE PUBLIC LANDS AND IDENTIFY THESE FOREST RESERVES. FROM THIS THE BORDER WITH MEXICO TO THE BORDER WITH CANADA. HE DID THAT ON HORSEBACK. AND SO I CARRIED THIS WITH ME. MY ENTIRE CAREER AND I'VE- I'M A STUDENT AND A HISTORIAN OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING OVER THAT PERIOD OF TIME. MINING WAS AHEAD OF THAT RIGHT SO WE HAD THE MINERS. PUTTING WOOD INTO SMOKE IN THE AIR FOR SMELTING IN DESTRUCTION IS ON THE LANDSCAPE UNDERGROUND'S TO KEEP TUNNELS FROM COLLAPSING. AND DOING IT TAKING EVERYTHING THAT WAS CLOSEST AND EASIEST TO GRAB. THEN WE ALSO HAD HUMAN CAUSED FIRES INCREASE. WE HAD AND I'M TALKING ABOUT THIS THIS KIND OF EUROPEAN SETTLEMENT POST NOT MEANT FOR MANAGEMENT OF THE RESOURCES AS THE FOREBEARS OF CALIFORNIA INDIGENOUS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DOING FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS PRIOR TO THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT AFTER NOW ALMOST WITH THE SPANISH. A CENTURY OF FIRE SUPPRESSION. AND A CENTURY OF PUTTING- LEGAL ACTION AGAINST PEOPLE WHO WERE STARTING FIRES INCLUDING INDIGENOUS. UP TO THIS POINT OF MINING. THEN MOVING FORWARD A RECOGNITION THAT WE HAVE TO SAVE THESE RESOURCES FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY AND NATIONAL MEETS. THAT'S WHEN THE FOR SERVICE BEGINS I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT A HUNDRED YEARS FORWARD WHAT I'M GONNA TAKE YOU TO NINETEEN TEN. USE IN NINETEEN TEN. AGAIN HOST. SETTLEMENT WE SAW BE WORST FIRE SEASON IN HISTORY. CALIFORNIA HAD FIRES BUT CALIFORNIA WASN'T THE FOCUS IT WAS IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST OUT TO IDAHO LITTLE BIT OF MONTANA AND THEN UP INTO THE BRITISH COLUMBIA. SEVEN MILLION ACRES BURNED. SEVEN MILLION ACRES. THAT WAS IN FIVE STATES. SO NOW FAST FORWARD. NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE. INTERESTING YEAR THAT'S THE FIRST YEAR THAT I STARTED FORESTRY SCHOOL AT UC BERKELEY. I DIDN'T KNOW MY GRANDFATHER HAD BEEN IN IN A FORESTRY SCHOOL HUNDRED YEARS PRIOR BUT I DO NOW. AND I DO KNOW THAT THERE'S SOMETHING IN ME THAT DROVE ME TO THIS PROFESSION THAT DROVE ME TO- WHAT I BELIEVE WE NEED TO BE DOING TO PROTECT OUR RESOURCES. AND PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES. ALL PROTECT OUR FORESTS AND WATERSHEDS. SO FORESTRY SCHOOL. THAT'S OVER THIRTY YEARS AGO RIGHT SO THIRTY PLUS YEAR CAREER FOCUSING ALL MY ATTENTION NEVER HEARING OFF OF THE FORESTRY PATH SINCE THAT TIME. I COME TO YOU. HAVING SEEN HER A TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE HUNDRED AND TEN YEARS AFTER THE BIG BIRD. THAT DWARFED THE BIG BIRD. WE ALMOST MET THE BIG BURNED ACREAGE JUST IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. JYJ'S HUGE CHANGE AND SWING THE POPULATION WHEN MY GREAT GRANDFATHER CAME TO CALIFORNIA WAS AROUND ONE POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE. IN NINETEEN SEVENTY TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE YEAH OVER FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. WE'VE GOT A DIFFERENT SCENARIO WE HAVE TO THINK OF THINGS IN A DIFFERENT WAY. IT IS ABOUT STATE PROTECTING THE RESOURCES IT'S ABOUT PROTECTING THE PEOPLE IT'S CRAP ABOUT PROTECTING- AND HARDENING COMMUNITIES AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT IN WAYS THAT MY GREAT GRANDFATHER NEVER COULD HAVE. WE HAVE THE SCIENCE. AND THE BACKING OF GOOD MANAGEMENT PRACTICES AND THE ABILITY TO ADJUST OUR MANAGEMENT PRACTICES OVER TIME. AND USE THE TASK FORCEWORK AND THE NINETY NINE TASKS THAT ARE THERE AND IT LOOKED GREAT THANK FULL BUDGET REQUEST THAT WERE EVER BUDGETS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON WITH CURRENTLY. TO ADAPT ARE MANAGED AND EVEN GET BETTER OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. AND CARRY THIS INTO THE FUTURE. AND THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT EXCITE ME ABOUT WHERE WE ARE I'D ALSO MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO LEAVE AT THE MOMENT BUT I AM VERY VERY EXCITED ABOUT WHERE THINGS ARE HEADED COME BACK TO GET ME AS THE STATE FIRE CHIEF AND AS THE STATE FORESTER I GET A CHANCE TO INTERACT NATIONALLY WITH MY COUNTERPARTS. IN PARTICULAR. WITH THE STATE FORESTERS. I HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH THEM THANKFULLY ACTUALLY CO THAT HAS BROUGHT US CLOSER TOGETHER BECAUSE WE'RE ABLE TO MEET MORE WITHOUT TRAVEL. AND WE HAVE BEEN MEETING AND TALKING. AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY STRIKING. THAT NATIONWIDE. STATE FORESTERS ARE SEEING VIRTUALLY THE SAME ISSUES ACROSS THE BOARD. NOT ONLY ARE WE SEEING THE SAME ISSUES. WE'RE HAVING THE SAME INTEREST AND EXCITEMENT ABOUT WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS FINALLY GOING TO INVEST. IN THEIR LACK OF MANAGEMENT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. ABOUT THEY STARTED WITH STRONG MANAGEMENT THERE'S BEEN SOME THINGS THAT ARE SLOW THINGS DOWN WE NEED TO GET BACK ON TRACK I SEE IT THE INVESTMENT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ASK. WORKING TO GET BACK ON TRACK. IT'S NOT UNLIKE WE'VE BEEN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THEY'RE JUST A COUPLE YEARS BEHIND. SO I EXPECT THAT THIS INVESTMENT NATIONWIDE. AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT REALLY ELEVATES. THE PRACTICE OF FORESTRY AND FOREST MANAGEMENT A NATIONWIDE THIS IS A TIME THAT FORESTRY IS IN A REVIVAL MODE THAT I COULDN'T EVEN HAVE IMAGINED WHEN I STARTED INTO THE PRACTICE OF FORCED WE ARE AT A POINT IN TIME WHERE WE ARE SEEING A TIDAL SHIFT. THAT IS MUCH LIKE THE BEGINNING. AT EIGHTEEN EIGHTY NINE. NIGHTS EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS PERIOD AND WE HAVE TO. HAVE TO SEIZE THAT MOMENT WE NEED TO PUSH FORWARD WE NEED TO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE GONNA ADAPT AND GET BETTER OVER TIME SO PERFECT IS NOT THAT STRONG WHAT WE'RE STRIVING FOR IN THE FIRST GO. WE ARE STRIVING TO GET THINGS DONE AND ADAPT OUR MANAGEMENT AND GET BETTER AND BETTER AND BETTER SO MY GRAND KIDS AND YOUR GRANDKIDS CAN SEE THE FOR US THAT WE ALL GREW UP. THAT IS IMPORTANT TO ME. WITH REGARD TO- KIND OF SPECIFICS. THEIR BADNESS SOME INVESTMENTS AND THIS COMES BACK TO THAT WORST WORKFORCE- IN SOME RESPECTS WE WE'VE DONE INVESTMENTS AND YOU'VE HEARD PRESENTATIONS ABOUT THE FIRE ADAPTED FIFTY PROJECT HIGHWAY FIFTY GOING UP THROUGH OUR PLACERVILLE SO- SLY PARK AND THEN ON UP TO LAKE TAHOE- JESSICA COVERED VERY WELL KIND OF THE EAST SIDE OF THAT AND THE SOUTHEAST SIDE OF THAT FIRE. WELL AS IT BURNED UP INTO THE BASEMENT. WHAT IS. NOT AS WELL COVERED- BUT IS AT LEAST AS EQUALLY. GREAT IS ALL OF THE WORK THAT WAS DONE IN AND AROUND SLY PARK. I ADAPTED FIFTY WORK ON ALL LANDS PRIVATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WATER DISTRICT A DAY IN THE FOREST SERVICE BROWN ALL IN IN CONJUNCTION WITH EACH OTHER AND CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER. THAT WORK KEPT THAT FIRE FROM BURNING BACK INTO PLACERVILLE SLY PARK PLACERVILLE AND POSSIBLY EVEN DOWN IN EL DORADO HILLS WHERE THESE FIRES HAVE BEEN BURNING ALL OF THAT WAS POSSIBLE. AND I SAW THAT ON SOME OF THE MAPS THAT WERE PROPOSED FOR THE- FIRE PROGRESSION THAT COULD HAPPEN OVER A SEVEN DAY PERIOD. WE STOPPED IT THE ONLY WAY WE STOPPED IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE FUELS WORK THAT HAPPENED DONE. THE BILL BACK EIGHT YEARS WE STARTED THAT PROJECT ROUGHLY EIGHT YEARS AGO. IT TAKES TIME TO GET THERE. WE STARTED THAT PROJECT THAT WE HAD. ONE ONLY ONE CONTRACTOR LOCAL TO CALIFORNIA THAT BID ON THE PROJECT WORK THE REST CAME FROM OUTSIDE THE STATE. OVER EIGHT YEARS WE'VE BEEN ADDING MONEY TO THIS. GUESS WHAT THERE ARE NOW OVER EIGHT CONTRACTORS LOCAL CALIFORNIA CONTRACTORS BIDDING ON THESE PROJECTS EVERY SINGLE TIME. YEAH WE'RE STILL BRINGING PEOPLE IN FROM OUTSIDE THE STATE BECAUSE WE NEED TO WE HAVE SO MUCH WORK TO DO AND WE GOT THE MONEY TO DO IT WE NEED TO KEEP DOING THAT BUT WE BY INVESTING AND CONTINUOUSLY INVESTING WE ARE SEEING. THE GROWTH OF LOCAL BUSINESS LOCAL PEOPLE DOING THE WORK THAT'S PROTECTING THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES WHICH- AGAIN THIS THIS IS SOMETHING. THAT I HAVE BEEN. HOPING FOR MY ENTIRE CAREER. YOU KNOW I SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER INSTANCE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN IN THE IT WITHIN HEALTHCARE. ALLEN I WOULD HAVE KILLED TO HAVE. AS MANY LOCAL CONTRACTORS AVAILABLE AS THERE ARE IN IN EL DORADO COUNTY- IN. ALL OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA LET ALONE ONE COUNTY WE JUST DIDN'T HAVE A WE IMPORTED. CONTRACTORS FROM MORE SAN JUAN NEVADA CITY SONORA TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE EARLY TWENTY TWO TWO THOUSAND IN ORDER TO DEAL WITH THE BEETLE KILL AND THE FIRES THAT WE WERE HAVING THEIR- SO. COME BACK TO THOSE PROJECTS WERE GREAT THERE'S- TWO THOUSAND THREE WHEN I REMEMBER THE CEDAR FIRE. YES LEAN THE LARGEST FIRE IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORY. THAT FIRE BURNED INTO FUELS PROJECTS THAT WE HAD DONE INTO. PRESCRIBED BURNS THAT WE HAD DONE IN THE STATE PARK. WE AMERICA STATE PARK. FOUR HUNDRED ACRES OF TIMBER FOREST. HÌNH FOREST BIG OLD TREES LOOK LIKE ANYWHERE IN SIERRA. WE'RE SAVED THE ONLY STAND OF TREES SAVED IN THAT FIRE ON THAT ON THAT STATE PARK WAS BECAUSE WE DID A FOUR HUNDRED ACRE PRESCRIBED BURN. ON THE OTHER SIDE IN CHAPARRAL CHAPARRAL PROJECTS THAT WERE FUEL BREAKS PRESCRIBED BURNS AND OTHER THINGS KEPT THAT FIRE FROM MOVING FURTHER SOUTH AND SWEEPING INTO- COMMUNITIES ON THE ON THE SIDES OUTSIDE THAT WOULD HAVE. CONNECTED WITH ANOTHER FIRE THAT WAS BURNING IT WAS ONLY FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES OF THE TIME BUT THAT WAS THE- TIME MINE FIRE THOSE FIRES COULD'VE AND PROBABLY WOULD'VE BURN TOGETHER IT HADN'T BEEN FOR FUELS PROJECT WORK. THAT WAS DONE ALONG THE- THE INTERSTATE EIGHTY CORRIDOR SO. WHAT WE NEED TO DO GOING FORWARD WHAT IS THE ONE THING THAT WE HAVE. WHITE RACKED THE NUMBER THAT. MY ASSERTION TO YOU IS WE HAVE WE ARE CRACK IN THE NOT ON EVERY SINGLE THING SAVE ONE. AND WE ARE STARTING TO WORK WORK ON THAT ONE. THAT IS REFORESTATION THAT THERE HAVE BEEN INVESTMENTS WE'RE VERY HAPPY WITH THE INVESTMENTS IN IN OUR REPORT FOR STATION CAPABILITIES ARE SEED BANK AND OUR CEILING CAPABILITIES. BUT REFORESTATION IF WE DON'T PUT THAT AT THE FOREFRONT PARTICULARLY WITH THE LARGE FIRES WE HAVE AND THIS IS BY AND LARGE. A FEDERAL ISSUE WE HAVE OUR SPACE WE ARE PRIVATE LANDOWNERS INDUSTRY'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF ITSELF PRETTY MUCH. BUT WE NEED TO GET TREES BACK IN THE GROUND. IT'S TOO MUCH IT TOO MANY OF THESE FIRES HAVE BURNED INTENSELY AND BURNS THE SEEDBED RIGHT OUT OF THE SOIL WE NEED TO ACTIVELY GO BACK AND PUT TREES IN THE GROUND THAT'S GONNA TAKE SOME EFFORT AND TAKE SOME ATTENTION AND SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS DOWNSTREAM SO. THAT'S ONE THING THAT I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING MORE- MORE IN AND MORE INVEST IN. SO WE'RE TAKING YOU DOWN THIS ROAD AND I STARTED A LITTLE BIT IN THIS SPACE. BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THAT DEEPLY AFFECTS THE STATE'S FORRESTER AND I CAN SAY THAT FOR ANOTHER THREE DAYS PROBABLY AND THEN I'LL BE THE REPORT RETIRED STATE FORESTER. AND I THINK THAT IS. ACTUALLY THE MOST PROUD THING THAT I HAVE- SITTING IN THIS POST STANDING IN THIS POST. BUT MY CAREER ONLY FOCUSED ON FORESTRY FOREST MANAGEMENT AND ALL THAT GOES WITH THAT THE MULTI DISCIPLINARY. KIND OF SPACE THAT THAT TAKES. IT SAYS IT WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY BEING THAT WE ARE ON THE RIGHT PATH. THINGS ARE HAPPENING. AND THEY'RE HAPPENING IN THE RIGHT WAY TO GIVE US A FOOTHOLD. TO KEEP ON GOING AND IT'S ALL OF OUR- RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP IT GOING. WE NEED TO KEEP IT GOING. AND YOU'VE YOU'VE ALL HEARD ME SAY THIS I BELIEVE. IF NOT NO MY ADMONISHMENT MY ADMONISHMENT IS. EVERY ACRE IN CALIFORNIA CAN AND WILL BURN SOME DAY. AND I BELIEVE WHOLEHEARTEDLY. THE LAST FIBER OF MY BEING. THAT GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM'S I ALREADY SAT BY HIS TASK FORCE WILDFIRE AND FOREST RESILIENCY TASK FORCE AND THE NINETY NINE TASKS THAT ARE THERE ARE PUTTING US ON THAT ROAD. WHAT DOES ON THAT ROAD TO BE A READY CALIFORNIA FOR WILDFIRES. THANK YOU. WELL I THANK YOU CHIEF THANK YOU- FOR THE HISTORY LESSON THAT TO BY MY CALCULATION WHICH NOBODY SHOULD RELY ON- TOOK US BACK A HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO YEARS- TO THE PRESENT THANK YOU FOR THE INSPIRATION AND THANK YOU FOR- ALL OF YOUR YEARS OF SERVICE- I'M SURE YOU'LL USE SAID THE NEXT THREE DAYS- IF EFFICIENTLY AS YOU DO WITH WITH WITH ALL OF YOUR TIME BUT I HOPE YOU'LL PAUSE- TO LISTEN TO THE- GRATITUDE OF THOSE THAT YOU WORK WITH AND OF THOSE WHO ARE- RESIDENTS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO WHO- OWE YOU A DEBT OF GRATITUDE FOR YOUR SERVICE.

AFTER THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION WELCOMES ARE. THANK YOU. RIGHT AFTER DINNER I THINK YOU'RE MY NOT ON HEARING THAT LIGHTS NOT ON TRY PUSHING THE BUTTON. I'M NOT A HOLD FOR YOU SEE THAT'S A VERY FAR I BE ABLE TO TRY ALSO. NO. FRAZIER DID I MAKE DID I MEAN YOU AT. IS IT WORKING NOW. TO THINK WHEN YOU SPEAK. I'VE ONLY. TRY AGAIN. ARE YOU GOING TO BE ON TRACK. YOU CAN TURN THE ONE ON THE OTHER SIDE ALL RIGHT THERE. TURN THAT OFF. THE. IT IS A WORK OF. GOOD JUST ONE TWO. GO. IF THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT. I WILL BE ASSISTING TO OUR- SURE THOSE COMMITTEE INTO SOME OF VALLEY MAY DS THE PRESENT ACCOUNT FORESTRY ASSOCIATION AND I- JUST WANTED TO SAY I EXPRESS GRATITUDE TODAY FOR- CALIFORNIA BE REACHED OUT TODAY CALIFORNIA'S REPRESENTS THE GREATEST MAJORITY OF THE FOREST PRODUCTS SECTOR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. INCLUSIVE INCLUSIVE OF THE OF ALMOST ALL THE MILLS OF THE NEAR PLANTS COGENERATION PLANTS AN APPROXIMATE THREE POINT FIVE MILLION ACRES ACROSS THE STATE. I DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE ONE BRIEF SECOND TOOK DOLLARS CHIEF PORTER ARCHIE PORTER'S BEEN A COLLEAGUE OF MINE A FRIEND OF MINE FOR A VERY LONG TIME SO I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS OUR RETIREMENT I KNOW HE'S NOT A MAN OF FANFARE BUT OF THOMAS TO A LISTING I JUST WANT TO SAY I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE. AND I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THE TIME THAT I SPENT WORKING WITH CHIEF PORTER DOES REPRESENT THE- PARTNERSHIP WHICH THAT'S IS NECESSARY THAT PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN. INDUSTRY IN THE STATE IS CLEARLY. HIS GOAL OR THEIR IS CLEARLY CRITICAL ROLE OVER THE OF LAST COUPLE YEAR IN THIS HAS BEEN. WITH WHAT COULD BE NOTHING LESS IN TURMOIL AS IT AS IT RELATES TO WILDFIRE CRISIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OVE THE TWENTY TWENTY FIRST SEASON IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FIRE SEASON PARDON ME- IT NEARLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES OF THE STATE HAVE EXPERIENCED. HIGH MORTALITY- OR WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER HIGH SEVERITY WILDFIRE OR MODERATE SEVERITY WILDFIRE. AND AT THIS POINT- THE PARTNERSHIP THAT THAT THAT'S WELL REPRESENTED MOTION SIR I WELL I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE PARTNERSHIP IS WELL KNOWN THAT WE NEED A AND GOT. A ROBUST INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO MEET OUR GOALS OF TREATING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES ON STATE PROPERTY OR STATE STATE AND PRIVATE LANDS AS WELL AS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES ON. FEDERAL LANDS BUT WE ALREADY TRUE TRIAGE STATE. THE NUMBER OF DEAD TREES OF WHICH THIS INDUSTRY IS TRYING TO METABOLIZE ON IT'S ONLY AND I WAS STANDING OUTSIDE ON. PRIVATE AREN'T EITHER A PRIVATE OR- PUBLIC LANDS- IS THE TREE IS THE MAIN GOAL OF OUR ASSOCIATION AT THIS AND MEMBERS OF OUR ASSOCIATION. FOR INSTANCE IN THE DIXIE FIRE ALONE. UP ON PRIVATE LANDS NEARLY ONE POINT SIX BILLION BOARD FEET HAS BIRD THAT IS ON THE PRIVATE LANDS ONLY THAT IS NOT WITHSTANDING ANY PUBLIC PLANS. ARE STATE PROCESSES ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE BILLION BOARD FEET IN A GIVEN YEAR. THE POINT BEING THAT THAT ONE CONFLAGRATION HAS RESULTED IN MORTALITY OF MORE BOARD FEET ONE FELL SWOOP AND WE ARE ABLE TO PROCESS ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE. IN A ONE THANK AND THAT AND THAT BEEN THE PERIMETER OF THE DIXIE FIRE. IT'S LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN IT UP AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PROCESS IT AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT. AND AGAIN WITH THE WITH THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DESIRE FOR THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PRIVATE INDUSTRY TO MEET OTHER GOALS WE HAVE SET FORTH- IT'S GOING TO BE VERY CHALLENGING. SO WE A LOT ABOUT THE POINT FOR BILLION. FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET AND I WILL SAY. WITHOUT HESITATION CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS THAT ALLOCATION OF FUNDING- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THAT WOULD BE THE BASELINE FUNDING THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER INTO THE FUTURE TO TRY TO COMBAT THE ISSUES OR THE CRISIS THAT WE'RE FACING- WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT FIRE PREVENTION IN THE SPACE OF FORESTRY- WE KNEW THE FIRE PREVENTION FOR DECADES AND FUND IT WOULD NEED TO BE FUNDED AND EXECUTED- BUT WE'VE NOW GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE POST FIRE RECOVERY IS GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY A POINT. ARE IS GONNA HAVE TO PLAY A ROLE IN FUTURE ALLOCATIONS AS RELATES TO THE BUDGET. AND BEYOND THAT WE NEED TO START LOOKING AT ALL THE TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST POST FIRE RECOVERY COUPLED WITH BIOMASS. BIOMASS INDUSTRY TO GET IT UP AND RUNNING AS A BRIDGE AS WE LOOK INTO INVESTMENTS INTO FUTURE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL COME TO SCALE. WE HAVE SEVERAL IDOL BIOGAS PLANTS OF THE STATE CURRENTLY AND EVEN WITH ALL BIOMASS FACILITIES UP AND RUNNING ARE WE STILL DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO GET WHERE WE NEED TO BE BUT TO HAVE I DON'T BOMBYCILLIDAE ASSUMES- SHORT SIGHTED. TO A CERTAIN EXTENT- WE DO WORKFORCE- JUST GOT MORE SAID TOUCHED ON IT- WE NEED FOR FUTURE INVESTMENTS AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WE HAVE BREAKS WE HAVE A GREAT OUR PROGRAM IS SHASTA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. I SAY REPLICATION OF THAT INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS TO OTHER. INSTITUTIONS OF THE J. C. STATUS SYSTEM SPREADING THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WOULD BE A SOLID STEP FORWARD. AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT THAT IN TODAY'S WORLD WE OPERATE IN CALIFORNIA UNDER FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEM AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE TALKING TODAY ABOUT FIRE PREVENTION. BUT WE CANNOT DECOUPLE THE DISCUSSION OF SUPPRESSION AS WELL- WE NEED TO HAVE A ROBUST SUPPRESSION FORCE I THINK IT'S PRETTY WELL UNDERSTOOD THE CALIFORNIA SHORT SEVERAL HAND CREWS THIS YEAR TO THE TO THE PROBABLY SEVENTY TO EIGHTY AND CREWS. THAT SAME PATTERNS EXIST WITHIN OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT BACKFILLING THAT THAT. AIM TO SHORTAGE SO THAT WE CAN GET ON THESE FIRES AND GET THEM OUT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER DURING FIRE SEASON. AGAIN WE'VE INVESTED ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN THE PREVENTION AND IF WE HAVE A ROBUST SUPPRESSION OF FORCE THAT'S ABLE TO GET THESE FIRES OUT EARLY THAT MEANS OF ACRES WILL BE RETAINED AND THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY INVEST THE MONEY AND THAT WE'RE INTENDED TO INVEST IN FIRE PREVENTION. BURNING. HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF ACRES A YEAR. I HIGH INTENSE NEED TO BE. PUTTING THESE FIRES OUT EARLY DURING FIRE SEASON SO THAT WE CAN INVEST IMPROPERLY AS IT RELATES TO- FIRE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. I'VE ALSO HEARD A LOT ABOUT VINCE VERSUS SUCCESS TODAY. AND AGAIN I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR CALIFORNIA IS A VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE INVESTMENTS MADE IN THE SPACE OF FIRE PREVENTION AND WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THAT. BUT THE BENCHMARKS OF SUCCESS I BELIEVE COULD BE. ARE FOCUSED ON LAST HIGH SEVERITY ACRES ACROSS THE STATE. AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT INNOVATIVE WAYS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN AS SOON WE ARE IN AN EXISTENTIAL CRISIS DOWNSTREAM WATERS. THE LONGS OF THE FOLKS IN THE BAY AREA AS WELL SACRAMENTO AND LA BASED SAID. I MEAN THIS WITH WILDFIRES BUT A PART OF FORESTRY FOR A VERY VERY LONG TIME. HISTORICALLY WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO METABOLIZE THAT WE ARE AT A CRISIS THAT HAS GONE BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF THE FOREST PRODUCTS SECTOR OR THE NATIONAL FOREST AND IS NOW AFFECTING EVERYBODY IN THE STATE. AND TAKING ACTION TO TRY TO CHANGE. ASPECTS OF OUR SYSTEM BEFORE THE ONSET OF THIS THAT'S FIRE SEASON WHICH I REMIND EVERYBODY IS REALLY ONLY MONTHS AWAY. SO THAT WOULD CONCLUDE MY REMARKS AND I APPRECIATE THE TIME AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- WILL PROCEED NOW WITH- JOHN ANDERSON FROM MENDOCINO HUMBOLDT REDWOOD COMPANY WELCOME SIR. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR BLOOM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND SOME OF THE MEMBERS SHALL OCCUR- MY NAME IS JOHN ANDERSON DIRECTOR FORCED POLICY FOR MISSING ON HUMBOLDT REDWOOD COMPANIES. HI TWO ONE I THINK CHIEF PORTER FOR A SERVICE- IT WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU AROUND HERE BUT HOPEFULLY WON'T BE A STRANGER. AND LYFT CHIEF PORTER I TOO AM A PROUD FORRESTER- IT BUT IT'S BEEN PAINFUL TO WATCH OUR FOREST DETERIORATE DO THESE WILDFIRES- WHERE WILDFIRES HAVE HAVEN'T REMOVED OVERSTOCK STANDS OR SEEN THE DROUGHT KILLED HUNDRED FORTY MILLION OR SO DEAD TREES EVEN WHEN THAT. AND THAT THAT'S TO THE OVER STOCKING OF THE FORESTERS OF FIRE SUPPRESSION TACTICS. THAT OTHERS HAVE TALKED ABOUT HERE TODAY- THE FUNDING IS ON PRESIDENT- BUT FUNDING ACHIEVED GOALS FOR WHICH THEY WERE ESTABLISHED. SO TODAY I JUST WANT TO TOUCH BRIEFLY ON- FOR TOPICS PERMIT EFFICIENCIES ACCOUNTABILITY FOR GETTING TO THIS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES. A LITTLE BIT ON BIOMASS LITTLE BIT ON FEDERAL LANDS. SO IN CALIFORNIA IF WE ARE GOING TO THIN OUT OF FOREST- TO REDUCE FEELS AND WE'RE GOING TO COMMERCIALIZE SOME OF THOSE TREES WE HAVE A THREE. PERMIT PROCESS HAT IS DUPLICATIVE- WE HAVE TO APPLY FOR THE TIMBER HARVEST PLAN WITH CAL FIRE WE HAVE TO GET. A DEEPER DUPLICATE A PERMIT FROM THE WATER BOARDS. AND ALSO FROM DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND THERE'S BEEN AND NUMBER OF EFFORTS- NONE OF WHICH I HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL AT STREAMLINING THAT PERMIT COMBINING ALL THREE OF THOSE PERMITS INTO ONE NOT HAVING THREE STATE AGENCIES DO THE SAME THING. SO I'M GLAD TO SEE IN THE BUDGET THAT THERE'S FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO. STREAMLINE THE PROCESS FOR PERMIT EFFICIENCY- BUT WE'VE HAD A BAD TRACK RECORD OF TRYING TO GET THEIR THERE'S BEEN. FIVE PASSED DIRECTIVES. TO STREAMLINE THE PERMIT PROCESS THE FIRST ONE WAS. EIGHTY FOURTEEN NINETY TWO AUTHORED BY THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE. THAT REQUIRED AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT EFFICIENCIES IN THE REGULATION OF TIMBER HARVESTING BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN. LIKE I SAID ANY IMPROVEMENTS ON THAT. FOUR OTHER ONES BROWN A FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN HAD AN EXECUTIVE ORDER- THAT. MANDATED VARIOUS AGENCIES TO SYNCHRONIZE AND EXPEDITE THE PROCESS. GOVERNOR NEWSOM IN TWENTY TWENTY- CHARGE THE- THAT'S RESOURCE IS AGENCY TO IMPLEMENT ACTIONS TO INCREASE THE PACE AND SCALE ENVIRONMENTAL REST- RESTORATION- IN IN THE- WILD FIRE FOREST RESILIENCY ACTION PLAN AND THAT CAME OUT IN JANUARY HAD A- KEY ACTION THAT- STATED THAT. THE PERMIT SYNCHRONIZATION WORK PLAN SHALL BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF THE YEAR. THIS YEAR. AND SB FOUR FIVE SIX BY LAYERED CALLED FOR PERMANENT SYNCHRONIZATION AS WELL THAT WAS JUST APPROVED. SO GIVEN THAT WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN ANYWHERE ON THIS- THE COMMITTEE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER SOME KIND OF REPORTING MECHANISM. TO MAKE SURE THAT WOULD REDUCE SPEND THOSE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR PERMANENT SYNCHRONIZATION THAT IT GETS DONE THIS TIME. AND ACCOUNTABILITY ON GETTING TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES- ASSEMBLY MEMBER PHONE YOU HAD MENTIONED EARLIER IN THIS- HEARING THAT- WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING TO HOW MANY ACRES AND HOW MANY PROJECTS HAVE BEEN DONE AND SO WE NEED A POINT PERSON TO BE IN CHARGE OF ALL THE VARIOUS PROJECTS THAT ARE GOING ON BY VARIOUS AGENCIES CONSERVANCY IS FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND HAVE THAT PERSON HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSEEING GETTING TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES PRIORITIZING PROJECTS MAKING SURE THEY'RE GOING IN AREAS AND WE DON'T HAVE THIS- PATCHWORK OF. PROJECTS GOING ON ACRES OF FORESTS IF WE CAN'T GET TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES A YEAR. THAT'S HARD TO SEE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE ANY DENT IN THIS ISSUE SO WE NEED A LARGE LANDSCAPING. PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED- NEED TO HAPPEN NOW AND IT'S BEEN A EXPEDITED MANNER- WE'VE HEARD ABOUT BIOMASS TODAY. OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA HAVE A TON OF IT MILLIONS OF TONS OF BIOMASS- MOST THE TIME THIS IS BURNED OUT IN THE WOODS AND THAT DOESN'T HELP OUR MISSION'S GOALS HERE IN THE STATE- AND SO WE NEED TO GET THE THAT INTO A BIOMASS FACILITY. AND BY OUR ESTIMATE WE NEED ROUGHLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO GET THAT MATERIAL TO A BIOMASS FACILITY- SO THAT'S- CONSIDERING THE COST OF WILDFIRE THAT'S CHEAP INSURANCE. AND THEN- FEDERAL FOREST LANDS- CHIEF PORTER TOUCHED ON REFORESTATION AND YES THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE JUST IN BETWEEN- TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN- FOR SERVICE LAS SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND ACRES OF FOREST THAT BURNED TO A DEFORESTED CONDITION AND ONLY TWENTY NINE PERCENT. WERE REPLANTED AND OF COURSE SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THAT'S- MORE OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER SO- IT WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL FOR THE STATE TO COME UP WITH SOME KIND OF MATCH FUNDING TO HELP OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS GET THOSE REFORESTED BACK TO. THEIR CARBON SEQUESTERING ABILITY SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THESE ISSUES. AND WILL TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT- YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS LAINNYA QUINN DAVIDSON FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. OKAY MORNING EVERYONE AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INCLUDING ME IN THE HEARING TODAY I'M HONORED TO BE HERE- MY NAME IS LINDA QUINN DAVIDSON AND I AM INSPIRED BY IS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BASED UP IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY AND WHILE I'M PHYSICALLY. LOCATED HERE ON THE NORTH COAST- I WORK ON FIRE RELATED ISSUES ACROSS THE STATE AND EVEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND REALLY MY PRIMARY PASSION FOCUSES PRESCRIBED FIRE WITH THE BENEFICIAL USE OF FIRE AS A TOOL- SO I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU HOW IMPORTANT PRESCRIBED FIRES YOU'RE SEEING ALL THE COVERAGE IN THE MEDIA AND- I'M SURE YOU ALL KNOW HOW HOW CRITICAL IT IS FOR OUR FUTURE WITH FIRE HERE IN CALIFORNIA- I THINK THE STARFIRES ALMOST BECOME HOUSEHOLD TERMINOLOGY. IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND REALLY FOR GOOD REASON- YOU KNOW IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE IT'S THE MOST ECOLOGICALLY APPROPRIATE AND COST EFFECTIVE TOOL THAT WE HAVE FOR MAKING OUR LANDSCAPES AND COMMUNITIES MORE RESILIENT- IN THE FACE OF THINGS LIKE WILDFIRE AND DROUGHT AND CLIMATE CHANGE. AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU ALL HAVE THE CHANCE TO SEE THE STRATEGIC PLAN FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCES JUST FINALIZING BUT I CAN HONESTLY SAY IT'S ONE OF THE BEST PLANS I'VE SEEN ON THIS TOPIC I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH THAT PRIORITIES AND STRATEGIES THAT ARE OUTLINED THERE AND MUCH OF THAT CONTENT CAME DIRECTLY FROM THE PRESCRIBED FIRE PRACTITIONER COMMUNITY WHICH I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT- SO YOU KNOW THIS LAST YEAR AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM ALL THE OTHER SPEAKERS. THIS LAST YEAR WAS REALLY MONUMENTAL FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE RELATED WORK- IN IN THE LEGISLATURE WE ADDRESS SOME OF THE MAJOR BARRIERS TO PRESCRIBED FIRE LIGHTING LIABILITY INSURANCE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH AND PROJECT FUNDING AND I WAS SO GLAD TO SEE SO MUCH ATTENTION AND INVESTMENT DIRECTED OFFICE FIRE RESILIENCE WORK ON PUTTING THE FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAMS TO JUST COME. AND IT HEALTHCARE LEADS- HATED FOR THE JUST CALLED MENTION AND OF COURSE THE REGIONAL PARK PASS PROGRAM THAT I THINK WILL TALK ABOUT AFTER I ARE ALL. GETTING TO UNITY THE SUPPORT. THAT TO REALLY TO ACTION THE PUBLIC LEVEL. AND IS SO IMPORTANT AS WE- TRY TO TOWARD THE GOALS WE HAVE A- THE STATE. I WAS ALL REALLY HARD TO SEE TE INVEST. IN THE WORK WE DO WITH YOU KNOW. OF AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL. FOR THE LAST YEARS I HAVE. ON EXTRA ADVICE AND- THE SOLE FOCUS IS ON. AND YOU CAN AND- BEING ONLY BY I IN HARD TO- YOU KNOW WE- OF VISORS SOMETHING ROLE A OF CONNECTION BETWEEN SCIENTISTS. COMMUNITIES REGULATORS- AGENCIES POLICYMAKERS TRIBESMAN MANAGERS WE'RE KIND OF AT THE CENTER OF ALL THAT WE HAVE ALL THOSE. YOU KNOW TRUSTING RELATIONSHIPS AND- WE WORK ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF FIRE SUPER COMPRESSED GOT FIRED FUELS MANAGEMENT TO HOME HARDENING IN COMMUNITY PLANNING. PUBLIC HEALTH AND PUBLIC POLICY- WE'RE JUST REALLY KIND OF JUST YOU KNOW ABLE THAT. ADJUSTER WORKS TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. AND SO I THINK THAT THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WE NOW HAVE THE SUPPORT WE NEED TO BUILD A BIGGER STATEWIDE PROGRAM. AROUND FIRED VISORS AND WE'RE CURRENTLY HIRING THREE MORE PEOPLE INTO POSITIONS LIKE MINE SO I WON'T BE THE ONLY PERSON- AND WE WILL ROLL OUT MORE POSITIONS IN THE COMING MONTHS SO. THESE FIREFIGHTERS ARE GOING TO BE A REALLY HUGE ASSET ACROSS THE STATE I'M WORKING ON DIFFERENT ISSUES DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY ARE YOU KNOW SOME MIGHT BE MORE URBAN MORE RURAL. AND I'M REALLY KIND OF ADOPTED THAT THE NEEDS. I ALSO. LIKE THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR CORPORATION IT WAS NEEDS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PRESCRIBED FIRE LIABILITY PILOT PROGRAM. WHICH WILL BE LIKE A STATE BACKED CLEAN SPONSOR PRESCRIBED FIRE. AND THE LACK OF INSURANCE HAS BEEN A HUGE ISSUE FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE WORK IN CALIFORNIA AND THE STATE BANK BEGINS FUND IS GOING TO BE ESSENTIAL. FOR MAKING SURE THE PRESCRIBED FIRE PRACTITIONERS CAN DO THE WORK THAT THE STATE NEEDS THEM TO DO. SO I THINK THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF CALIFORNIA BEING REALLY CREATIVE IN HOW WE APPROACH IS COMPLEX ISSUE- I MEAN INSPIRE AND INSURANCE ARE CALM. THINGS TO DEAL WITH RIGHT NOW. AND WE WERE TO. LIKE REALLY NEED ACTION AT THE RIGHT TIME SO THIS CLAIMS LAW THAT WE TO SEND DODD SENATE BILL THIRTY TWO. THESE HAVING. BROAD FROM ACROSS THE STATE. INCLUDING FROM RANCHO TRY. AND GROUPS TIMBER IN. SIGN KNOCKABOUT. UNITY MAN- YOU KNOW JUST READ SHOW THAT HE'S IN. IN POLICY ACTION. ARE BLAH SO. AND PRIOR THIS PERSON FIRE WORK HUGE PRIORITY. FOR DIVERSE GROUPS AND HEALTH. REALLY BUT I. WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WHILE WE NEED TO INCREDIBLE AND BRING. BEST USED HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO. AND MONEY IS A CRITICAL PART OF SOLUTION BUT IF THE ACTUAL EMPLOYMENT. OF THE PROGRAM THAT WILL AFFECT THE NEEDED. SO THERE ARE A FEW THAT I WANT TO PLAY FOR YOU. FOR ONE IN TWENTY EIGHT. TWELVE SIXTEEN HUNDRED OF THE- OF THE STATE CERTIFY BURNED BY PROGR. TO CERTIFY AND PROVIDE A- FOR PRIDE PRACTICE. TO PLANET IMPLEMENT PROJECTS. AND I SERVED ON THE CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE FOR THAT PROGRAM. WHICH WAS FINALIZED BY THE STATE EARLIER THIS YEAR A COUPLE YEARS TO DEVELOP THAT CURRICULUM AND TO YOU KNOW MOVE IT TO THE NEEDED APPROVALS. I HOSTED THE FIRST CLASS HERE IN MAY AND I WAS THE ONLY CLASS THAT'S HAPPENED SO FAR. AND EIGHTEEN EXPERIENCED PRESCRIBED FIRE PRACTITIONERS INCLUDING NINE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED BURN BOSSES. WORK FULL CAREERS AND FIRE. I JUST POINT I'M SEVEN MONTHS LATER. NOT A SINGLE PERSON TO BUY CLASSES BEEN CERTIFIED BY THE STATE. AND WE MISSED A TON OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. THERE IS A HUGE NEED FOR QUALIFIED BROWN BOSSES TO PLAN AND IMPLEMENT PROJECTS AND TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT LANDOWNERS. BUT WITHOUT THE STATE CERTIFICATION AND THE PROTECTIONS THAT CAN PROVIDE. MANY OF THOSE FOLKS ARE NOT WILLING TO GO OUT AND DO THAT WORK. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO IRON THIS OUT AND I'M PLANNING TO WORK WITH CAL FIRE AND CONTINUE WORKING STATE FIRE TRAINING TO ENSURE. THAT THIS PROGRAM IS A SUCCESS. BECAUSE ABSOLUTELY S. FOR THIS. OF ALL INVESTING FOR ME IN THIS OF WORK TRACK WITH A VOTE OF THIS. SO AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S JUST WORK ON. THIS IS SUCH A PIVOTAL OF THE PIE WE JUST NOT GONNA GET WORK DONE. YOU KNOW THE INVEST THAT WE'RE- ARE NOT TO OUT. TO LAY OUT A THE GROUND IF WE FIGURE PIECES OUT WE REALLY HAVE TO BE. BROWN THIS WORK WE NEEDED TO. OUR CULTURE. MINISTRY PROBLEM. AT THE SAME TIME MAKING USE. INVESTMENTS AND WE KNOW THE AGE CAN'T DO WITH THE WORK ONE. THEY NEED TO MAKES FOR ALL. HER AN EX TO BE INVOLVED. SO- I JUST WEST ONE OF YOU AGAIN FOR THE GREAT WORK IN THE VISION YOU ALL UP FOR AROUND FIVE. AND BRING THEM OF THE I MAKES. AT UNIVERSE FONG. ARE RESOURCE FOR YOU WE'RE ALL HAPPY TO INFORM. TO YOUR EFFORTS IN FACT. THANKS SO MUCH TO. ALISON FROM THE WATER. RESEARCH AND TRAINING. MEETINGS- MY NAME IS ALL. JOHN AND- TO YOU TODAY AS THE RE. OR AND FIRE CAPACITY PRO. DIRECTOR OF THE WATERSHED RESEARCH TRAININGS. FIRST I THINK TERRIBLE ARRESTED COMMITTEE. YEAH TO SPEAK WITH NO TODAY. THE WATERSHED. IS A NON. ORGANIZATION LOCATED AT. COUNTY WE'VE BEEN IN THE BUSINESS OF FOR A REST. QUALIFY WILL. AND WE'RE- DEVELOPMENT FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS NOW. I TRIED TO TELL YOU THAT WERE ONE OF THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS IN TRINITY COUNTY. WE PLAN AND IMPLEMENT FOREST HEALTH WILDFIRE MITIGATION PROJECTS. YOU'RE AND YOU'RE OUT. WE CALLED NUMEROUS BY GRANT TO. WITH THE RANGE OF STATE FEDERAL. INVESTING WELFARE LEAD. WE ALSO WATERSHED AMERISUR OF YOUR ROLE OF THE STATE AND I LEVEL. DID YOU FROM WORKING ON THE TELL WHILE. FORESTRY TEST FORCE AND IT'S VERY WORKING TOUR PART. WITH THE OF CONSERVATION ON ARCHITECTURE AND IMPLEMENTATION. OF THE REGIONAL FOREST AND FIRE CAPACITY PROGRAM OR ARE FSC. NATIONALLY WE RUN THE FIRE ADOPTED COMMUNITIES LEARNING NETWORK. MY ROLE THE WATERSHED CENTERS OVERSEEING OUR ARGOSY PROGRAM. IN ADDITION OVERSEEING THAT PROGRAM I RECENTLY COMPLETED ANOTHER TOWARD TRAVELING WITH ONE OF ONLY SIXTEEN TYPE ONE FEDERAL. INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAMS IN THE COUNTRY. I TWO A HALF YEARS OF OVERSEE THIS ARE OF SHEEP. YEAH ANOTHER SUMMER FALL WORKING ON ONE. ACROSS THE WAY. INCLUDING WORKING ON THE DIXIE FIRE. AND QUITE FRANKLY ON A PERSONAL LEVEL BEING A FORMER RESIDENT OF GREENVILLE MYSELF. THERE SO MANY THINGS I WISH I'D HAVE TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT TODAY. FIRST I APPRECIATE ALL THE INCREDIBLE STRIDES THAT THE STATE IS MAKING. YES OUR WILDFIRES CONTINUE TO BREAK RECORDS BUT SO DOES OUR COMMITMENT TO FACE THE PROBLEM HEAD ON. WITH THESE UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION TO THE MAGNITUDE OF FUNDING BEING ALLOCATED TO FIRE THE MULTI FACETED NUANCED APPROACHES OR SOMETHING TO BE VERY PRODUCT. SIGNIFICANT SUMS LIKE WHEN YOU MENTION TO TRIBES. GREAT STRIDES WITH PRESCRIBED FIRE LEGISLATION. THINKING AHEAD AND HEARING IMPLEMENTATION FUNDS WITH CAPACITY BUILDING AND PLANNING FUNDS. NO OTHER STATE OR FEDERAL AGENCY TO MY KNOWLEDGE HAS HAD THE FORESIGHT TO INVEST SO HEAVILY IN WILDFIRE CAPACITY IN PARTICULAR AGAIN THINK ABOUT THAT SEAT AND ARGOSY PROGRAM. THE PAST EIGHT ELECT A LEADER MAKING SOME GREAT SO FOR. REGARDING THE CHILD THAT I'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON TODAY. LET'S GO BACK IN TIME TO NINETEEN. AT THE ONSET OF THE ARCHIVE SEE PROGRAM MIGHT ORGANIZATION COMMISSIONED A THIRD PARTY CAPACITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT SEEKING TO ANSWER THE BASIC QUESTION. WHAT DO ENTITIES WORKING IN A LANDSCAPE LEVEL ON FOREST FIRE WORK WITHIN CALIFORNIA MOST NEED. TO SCALE UP THEIR WORK. ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REPORTED NEEDS OF SELVES PAUL OVERHEAD. ALSO KNOWN AS INTER OR ADMINISTRATIVE SPENDING SUPPORT. NOW YOU TO THE CHASE AND SAY OVER IS. PROFIT OVERHEAD IS MONEY KEEP ON THE LIGHTS THE FUNDS THAT COVER ADMINISTER STAFF. IN WHO MANAGES THE BOOKS THE PERSON WHO CUTS THE CHECKS OFFICE SPACE COMPUTERS UTILITY BILLS STOPS WHEN THEY CAN'T BE BUILT TO PROJECTS FOR CRITICAL PARTS OF THE JOB LIKE ATTENDING STAFF MEETINGS PERFORMANCE REVIEWS STRATEGIC PLANNING. ONE I DIDN'T FOR A MINUTE IF YOU COULD NOT ATTEND MEETINGS THAT WERE PARAMOUNT TO YOUR WORK BECAUSE YOU DO NOT HAVE A WAY TO BILL FOR YOUR TIME. THAT IS WHAT SOME OF MY WILD FIRE COLLEAGUES DEAL EVERY SINGLE WEEK. BILLS FOR THINGS LIKE LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING. AUDITS LIABILITY INSURANCE REPAIRING PUBLICATIONS SOLICITATIONS. INVOICING OVERHEAD IN THIS CONTEXT IS THE SUM OF EXPENSES THAT ALLOW ORGANIZATIONS TO FUNCTION LIKE THE HIGH CAPACITY PARTNERS. BUT I KNOW THE STATE WANTS TO BE IN BUSINESS WITH. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS STANDARDIZED METHODS OF WORKING WITH THEIR PARTNERS TO UNDERSTAND THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS IT'S RECALCULATED EVERY ONE TO FIVE YEARS. THAT COSTA COMES IN AGREED TO PERCENTAGE AGAIN BASED ON ACTUAL EXPENSES AND THAT ORGANIZATION BILLS THAT RATE WHEN WORKING DOCUMENTS AND AGREEMENTS WITH FEDERAL AGENCIES. THIS IS CAUGHT IN BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T ENTER COSTS REDEPLOYMENT OR NIAGARA FOR SHORT. MANY OF THE SAME NUMBER STRIVES C. COUNCIL AN RC. WORK ALLEGED TO GET THE FUNDING YOU ALL OF OUR- PREVIOUS AND EARLY ACT. ARE NOW OF THOSE GROUP. THAT YOU'RE COUNTING ON TO DO THE WILDFIRE WORKSHOP. AND RELY THEIR- WHAT SHOULD CENTERS CURRENT MAKERS 2380% HOW DID DOUBLE CHECK WITH MY BOSS FROM BIRCH DURING THAT THEY WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS BUT I WANT TO HAVE TO KNOW. AND MY BE TO WORK WEST SICHUAN THREE POINT EIGHTEEN. MANY OF OUR TRUSTED IN TWENTY OR EVEN HIGHER. YOU KNOW OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM RIGHT IS ON THE- AND THEN LOCAL FIRE. HEARTBREAKS OR EVEN THAN THAT. AGAIN THAT'S THE RATE OF DOING BUSINESS. EVERY WATERSHED CENTER ENTERS THE- THAT OVER IT TAKES WHILE PERCENT. WHICH IS THE KERN HEALTH OVER RATE. YOUR LOSING A OF SENSE ON THE DOLLAR. IN ORDER TO THE DOORS. HEY RON TIME AND BILL PAY. EITHER HAVE TO OPERATE IN THE WHOLE. OR SPEND THESE STUFF TO PASS TO FIND PRIVATE. FOR GETTING. THAT JENNER PROFIT THAT I KNOW THE STATE COUNCIL. OUR PARTNERS INCLUDING SOME TRY WITH THREE IN THE FOR. NEWS THIRTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR ENTERING INTO A CO FIRE AGREE. WELL WE ARE SO THANK TO BE LONG TIME HEALTH GREATER RECIPIENT PARTNER. THAT LOST IS TRANSLATE TO. OF DOLLARS WHEN DEALING WITH THE MOST MILLION GRANT. THIS IS. CONVERSELY THERE BEEN YEARS WHEN I COME 70% SO THE YEARS IF YOU'RE WILLING TO. THE CAPTIVE STATE PER. THE STATE WOULD HAVE BEEN OVER. SO NOW THAT I'VE GOT YOU. PER EARLY ACTION OFFICE FUNDS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE IN MY- THAT ESTATE WHAT PART. IS ALL NEEDS TO CHARGE ACTUAL OVER RATES. THEY'RE KEEPING SIMPLE THERE ARE HONORING GROWTH ALL IN WITH AND OTHER TOP OVERHEAD TWENTY. THIS IS A GREAT. AND MORE AGE NEED TO FOLLOW. THANK A WIN WIN EVERY INVOLVED THE GRANT HE DOESN'T DRINK TO PASS. AND THE GRANT DOESN'T REST OF APAC. THE LAST ONE I WANT TO MAKE ABOUT OVERHEAD RATES REALLY WORK ABOUT. TEAM THAT'S COME UP THAT TIMES TO AND I NOTICED. ON BASIS SINCE OUR- ON THE JOB TRAINING. IS A CORNER OF WORK TO. IN THE THAT MANY OR- SUPPORT THEIR STOCK DOING. IS OVER. WHETHER THAT'S ATTENDING A BIRD BALL COURSE MEDIA MENTION STUDY FOR AN EXAM TO A REGISTERED. FORESTER PERTAINING WHILE THEY EXPRESS ARC WELDING. FOURTEEN A SIMPLE ALL. LIKE MOST PROVIDE. FOREST IN FIREWORKS NEED CONTINUED EDUCATE ENTRY TO DELIVER HIGH PROJECTS. IN ORDER TO MEET THE STATE'S Y. IN SCHOOL I URGE THIS COMMITTEE ENSURE THE FUTURE. FUNDING REGARDLESS THE AGES OR OF THE PROGRAM AND ITS ALLOCATED TO ALLOW ORGANIZATION TO CHARGE THEIR ACTUAL RATE OF DOING BUSINESS. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S MATTHEW KEEP THE SEMPORNA FASHION. BUT WITHOUT THIS CHANGE MANY OF THE ORGANIZATIONS YOU SEEK TO WORK WITH SIMPLY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO DO BUSINESS WITH YEAH. THIS IS A SIMPLE YET CRITICAL WAY TO SUPPORT THE WORK THAT I KNOW WE ALL WANT TO SEE HAPPEN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU FOR MUCH. THANK THANK YOU TO ALL OF OUR PANELISTS FOR- THE VERY INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION THAT- THAT WE'VE HAD OVER THE LAST HOUR OR SO DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS MR GALLAGHER. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AND- I DO HAVE. A FEW QUESTIONS I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU WANT TO. RIGHT AWAY DOLLARS RUN THROUGH THEM AND I KNOW YOU KNOW I RECKON THERE'S- REMIND TO SOME OF YOUR ONE ASK WAS TO. I DO AND I DON'T PEOPLE WENT PRETTY LONG IN THEIR PRESENTATIONS WAS A LOT IN THERE AND AS THE CHAIR SAID THERE'S A LOT TO GO THROUGH THIS. A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND SO I'D APPRECIATE IF JUST I WANT TO GET THROUGH SOME THINGS AND IF YOU COULD TRYING KEEP YOUR ANSWERS. I GUESS IS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE SO WE CAN GET THROUGH. SOME OF THIS- I WANT TO ALSO THINK- CHIEF TOM PORTER FOR HIS GREAT SERVICE TO OUR STATE- AND I APPRECIATED THAT THE HISTORY LESSON- YOU KNOW AND- AS A STUDENT OF HISTORY MYSELF- IF WE HAVE BEEN MNAGING OUR FOREST- LIKE PENSION- TAUGHT. WE'D BE IN A MUCH. BETTER PLACE TODAY IN CALIFORNIA. A PART OF THE PROBLEM IS WE'VE BEEN MANAGING THEM ACCORDING TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF JOHN MUIR. AND THAT HAS BEEN PART OF THE PROBLEM- BUT TO THAT POINT I MEAN AGAIN URGENCY I THINK IS THE ISSUE WE GOT MONEY MONEY TO INVEST. BUT HOW ARE WE DOING ON GETTING PROJECTS DONE WE KNOW THAT WITH THE FIRST. BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN A LONG TIME IN COMING WE HAVEN'T DONE THIS- OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES WE HAVEN'T BEEN IN THAT PENSION. CONSERVATION MULTI USE MANAGEMENT FRAME OF MIND WITH HOW WE MANAGE OUR FORESTS- AND WE'VE GOT A LOT TO MAKE UP FOR RIGHT SO- LAST YEAR. IT CAME OUT THAT YOU KNOW WITH WITH THAT FIRST INFUSION OF DOLLARS THAT WE GOT. WE GOT ELEVEN THOUSAND ACRES TREATED THAT THOSE ARE THE FACTS SO WHAT I WANT TO GET INTO IS HOW ARE WE DOING. SO FAR WITH EARLY ACTION SO TO- MISS MORRIS YOU IDENTIFIED TWO HUNDRED SIXTY PROJECTS- THAT HAVE BEEN FAST TRACKED WITH THE EARLY ACTION. MONEY COULD WE GET A LIST OF THOSE PROJECTS IS ONE THING I'D LIKE TO SEE IF THE COMMITTEE COULD GET A LIST OF THAT AND THEN HOW MANY ACRES. IS THAT TRANSLATE TO ONCE THOSE PROJECTS ARE COMPLETED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND- HAPPY TO SHARE THE LAST- WE'VE SHARED IT WITH THE L. A- AND SO HAPPY TO SHARE THAT- WITH ALL OF YOU AS WELL- AND- ACRES ARE GONNA BE REPORTED BACK FROM ALL OF OUR PARTNERS- ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND- SO WE HAVE A LOT OF PLANNING ACRES BUT AS- WE KNOW ON THE GROUND- ONE CELL WILL REPORT THAT BACK OUT ONCE THEY'RE COMPLETED. THANK YOU DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE THE OF THE PLANNED ACRES I MEAN WE'VE GOT A PLAN IN PLACE. AND I THINK WE HAVE A GOOD PLAN- BUT HOW MANY ACRES ARE WE ESTIMATE WILL BE TREATED ONCE HE'S EARLY ACTION PROJECTS ARE DONE AND THEN I MOVED TO THE- THE MORE SCALED UP PROJECTS. ARE GOING TO BE PART OF THE NINE OR NINETY EIGHT MILLION. SO IN THE PLANET. ACRES WITH LOOKS. SORT OF THE ENTIRE PRINT OF THE PROJECT- WHICH IS WHERE YOU DO YOUR ENVIRONMENT. ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS WHERE YOU DO YOUR IDENTIFICATION OF WHAT AREAS YOU'RE PROTECTING- IDENTIFY WHERE YOU'RE GONNA PUTTING YOUR CHILDREN ACTION- AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE ACTUALLY CALCULATING ACRES TREATED- IS AS COMPLETED THE WAY WE ACTUALLY TRACK THAT IS ACTUALLY BASED ON PHYSICAL VEGETATION REMOVED. SO IT'S ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF THE- THE ACRES THAT YOU'RE PLANNING ON- IN THE TREATMENT SO- WE'RE GONNA REPORT OUT AFTER WE ACTUALLY HAVE THE- ACRES HI AFTER THOSE PROJECTS ARE COMPLETED. AND WILL BE GETTING THOSE BACK FROM OUR PARTNERS AT THE END OF THE YEAR. OKAY WHEN THE PROJECT FOR COMPLETING INTO SOME QUESTION WHAT'S THE- OF THAT. A FOR NOW. I WOULD URGE YOU ARE STATE FORESTER WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THIS MORE AT AND I'M TRYING TO GIVE YOU A TECHNICAL EXPLANATION BUT- I DON'T UNDERSTAND I NEED TO GIVE YOU AN EASIER ONE. AND I UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TREATED I THINK WE'VE BECOME REALLY FAMILIAR WITH WHAT'S TREATED AND WHAT'S PROTECTED- BUT THAT'S ANOTHER PART OF THIS WE NEED REAL TRANSPARENCY ON. YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENCES AND TREATMENTS. AND WHAT IS ACTUALLY PROTECTED AT THE END OF THE DAY. RIGHT AND- WHAT JESSICA ELUDED TO WITHOUT SAYING. AGAIN THE STOP ORDER. STATE FORESTER AND FIRE CHIEF HEALTHCARE. BUT IS THAT THAT THOSE ACRES WILL BE RECORDED AS THEY COME IN- THAT IS THE WAY THE PROCESS WORKS. I GET YOU WITH THE ESTIMATE BUT THE ESTIMATE- I DON'T HOW. AND WE CAN PROVIDE THE LIST. AS JESSICA MENTIONED ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE THERE AND THE DETAIL THAT'S IN THOSE PROJECTS. WELL THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE AT THIS POINT. OKAY SO WE DON'T HAVE AN ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT- HOW ABOUT A MAN ARE YOU GUYS THINKING ABOUT DOING A MAP BUT DIGITAL MAP OF THE STATE THAT WOULD SHOW. BECAUSE I THINK A BIG PROBLEM HERE IS TRANSPARENCY AND REALLY KNOWING GROUND- WITH THIS MONEY. SOMETHING THAT WOULD SHOW LIKE. YOU KNOW WHERE THESE PROJECTS ARE LOCATED HOW MANY ACRES. ARE ULTIMATELY BEING DONE THERE AND THEN WHAT TYPE OF TREATMENT YOU KNOW IS A PRESCRIBED FIRE IS IT SENDING. ARE THESE PRIVATE PROJECTS OR THESE YOU KNOW THESE PRIVATE YOU KNOW. LANDOWNERS OR- COMMERCIAL LOGGING OPERATIONS ARE THEY- FIRE SAFE COUNCIL PROJECTS I MEAN. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU GUYS ARE THINKING ABOUT PUTTING TOGETHER BECAUSE I THINK THAT BE REALLY HELPFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE BUT ALSO FOR THE PUBLIC TO JUST SEE. WHAT ARE WE DOING WHAT TYPES OF PROJECTS ARE THEY WHAT IS IT TRANSLATE INTO IN TERMS OF OVERALL ACRES PROJECT- PROTECTED IS THAT SOMETHING YOU GUYS ARE THINKING ABOUT. YES THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPED- WE HAVE A CAL MAPPER WHICH IS. A PROGRAM THAT CAL FIRE USES FOR THE CALCULATOR PROJECTS AND THE GRANT PROJECTS THAT ARE THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR- DIRECT GRANT. GRANTEES THAT PROGRAM IS BEING EXPANDED UNDER THE- THE TASK FORCES- TUTELAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S AVAILABLE FOR ALL OF. THE STATE- DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES TO UTILIZE TO CAPTURE THOSE- IT'S NOT IT'S NOT COMPLETELY FLUSHED OUT WITH ALL BUT THE PARTNERSHIPS YET BOB. IS THE PLACE WHERE THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. WHO CAN WIN MIGHT BE UP AND RUNNING YOU THINK- CHIEF. WELL WE'RE WORKING ON IT- CURRENTLY AND IT'LL IT'LL PROBABLY BE IN THE NEXT YEAR- TO GET IT FLUSHED OUT AND THEN TO WORK THROUGH SOME OF THE DETAILS AND- NOT MAKING SURE THAT WORK COUNTY. FOR APPLES ANOTHER NEW WANTS TO WHAT YOU JUST ASKED- IN IN DAHLE STATEWIDE MAP IS THAT PART OF THE- STEWARDSHIP AGREEMENT THAT- WE HAVE WITH THE FOR SERVICE THAT JESSICA MENTIONED IN HER PRESENTATION AT THE VERY BEGINNING. AS WELL AS- TASK UNDER THE TASK FORCE OF THE NINETY NINE IS TO HAVE A JOINT PROJECT LIST AND JOINT PROJECT MAP THAT SHOWS. ARE OVER TIME WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT S. ASPARTIC PRIORITIES AND DOING PROJECTS ON THE LANDSCAPE THAT'S UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND PART OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAM SO WE'RE NOW WE'RE NOW KIND OF DOVETAILING INTO THEIR TIME ONE. THAT LOOKS LIKE IT'S COMING TOGETHER SOMETIME IN FEBRUARY OR MARCH. YES YOU CAN- AND THEN BACK TO MISS MORE. I AM VERY INTERESTED IN BY. MEANT THAT'S GOING TO BE A PART OF THIS IS REALLY GETTING PLANTS UP AND HAVING A PLACE TO TAKE WOULD BE WASTE- YOU MENTIONED THAT IN THE WITH THE NINE OR NINETY EIGHT MILLION- THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO JUMPSTART BIOMASS PROJECTS CAN YOU. SPECIFY PROJECTS THAT RIGHT NOW ARE BEING TARGETED FOR BEING JUMPSTARTED- YOU IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. NOW WITH THIS MONEY. SURE THING IN THAT CLIMATE CATALYST FUND WHICH IS A TECHNOLOGY AGNOSTIC SO IT'S CREATES LOANS FOR ANYBODY THAT IS WANTING uSTART A PROGRAM THAT WOULD UTILIZE- WHAT HE BY MASTER FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO START A MASS TIMBER FACILITY- OR IF YOU'RE TRYING TO START- PYROLYSIS- OR DOING SOMETHING MORE TRADITIONAL LAKE UNTIL- SO ANYTHING THAT IS FINDING HIGHER YOU SEVEN OPEN PILE BURNING OF THIS MATERIAL I WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN THE CLIMATE CATALYST FUND- WHICH IS JUST WATCHING THAT WAS FIVE FUNDED IN SEPTEMBER AND I AND IS GOING BEFORE THE INFRASTRUCTURE BANK- AND THEY'RE ALREADY STARTING TO TAKE IN AND THEY HAVE THEIR LIFE ON THEIR WEBSITE TO TAKE. ENQUIRIES AND APPLICATIONS FROM AYE FROM INTERESTED BUSINESSES THAT ARE READY TO START UP- OTHER INVESTMENTS IN THE BILASPUR SO IF FIELD ARE THINGS LIKE I LIKE I MENTIONED THESE- FEEDSTOCK AGGREGATORS SO SAD FIVE PRO AROUND THE STATE ARE TRYING TO RETHINK THE WAY WE MOVE BIOMASS AND THE WAY WE GIVE OFF SUPPLY GUARANTEES SO THAT IT CREATES A MORE STABLE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT TO START UP- THESE AT LARGE CAPITAL INTENSIVE BUSINESSES THAT WILL GET US TO SCALE WE CAN START YOU SAYING AT THE FOREST- MATERIAL. MORE EFFICIENTLY. OKAY AND THEN JUST YOUR ADVENTURE THAT SOME PRO FOR JOHN STARTING I MEAN THERE'S- ONE THAT OF OUR TAKEN A- OF SOME OF THESE. IN OUR AND OUR- STARTED STARTING BREAK OR WERE GETTING DOWN THE ROAD ON THEM. SO THE CLIMATE KALISPELL IS JUST ROLLING OUT I MEAN I CAN POINT TO PREVIOUS INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE- FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A MILLION DOLLAR. GRANT FROM THAT- TIMBER FINE FROM THIS YEAR ABOUT A CONSERVANCY. THAT WENT CHIU- I MIL UP IN CRESCENT MILLS. THAT IS OPENING UP AS WE SPEAK AND- ALLOWS THEM TO BE ABLE TO BUILD LIFE ON. THE DIXIE FIRE FOOTPRINT RIGHT FROM GREENBELT ABOUT FIVE MILES DOWN THE ROAD MILLING. AND THE BRING IT BACK- TO HELP THE CONSTRUCTION OF GREENVILLE I MEAN THAT SHORTENS. YOUR ON TRAVEL TIME AND ALSO OPENS UP- YOU KNOW SOME SMALL MILL CAPACITY- WITH WILL THAT'LL TAKE IN LARGE I AM- TREES- IT RIGHT IN THE MEDIAFIRE. FOOTPRINT OKAY. AND THEN- SO ANOTHER PART WE TALK ABOUT FEDERAL STATE PARTNERSHIP AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- BUT WE ALSO YOU KNOW WE KIND OF BELIEVE OUT OF THAT PRIVATE AND I THINK AS YOU MENTIONED THERE'S FORTY PERCENT. OF THE LAND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS PRIVATELY OWNED EITHER BY YOU KNOW- TIMBER COMPANIES ARE SMALL LANDOWNERS- SAY MAKE UP 40% OF THAT WHAT ARE WE DOING TO HELP STREAMLINE THE PERMITTING PROCESS BECAUSE THAT WAS SOMETHING IDENTIFIED. BY MISTER ANDERSON IS THAT WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT THAT BUT RIGHT NOW YOU GO TO A T. H. P. AND EVEN WITH CAL TREES PROGRAM- YOU GET THE THV PERMIT BUT THEN IT'S NOT STREAMLINED WITH SAY WATER BOARD PERMITS- OR OF FISH AND WILDLIFE PERMITS- HOW CAN WE MAKE THAT JUST ONE PROCESS SO THAT. WE CAN SPEAK FAST TRACK THESE PRIVATE PROJECTS WHICH ARE A BIG PART OF THE ISSUE. SO WITH CALTRAIN IS ASKED WITH THE TIMBER HARVEST PLANS THERE'S A COUPLE OF YEARS A PERMIT SO YOU'VE GOT- A LOT OF. COMPANIES ARE RIGHT NOW USING THE EMERGENCY AN EXEMPTION PERMITS WHICH HAVE GONE ON THE ONLINE TO THIS ONLINE PERMITTING PROCESS THAT WE CALL CAL TREES- AND THAT HAS ABOUT A FIVE DAY TURNAROUND. SO FOR ALL THE SALVAGE LOGGING THAT'S GOING FORWARD WHICH IS THE MAJORITY OF OUR TIMBER HARVEST HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. THERE'S A VERY FAST TRACK FOR THAT- WE ARE WORKING INCREDIBLY HARD TO HAVE CAL TREES TRANSITION. TO BEING THAT SORT OF SINGLE APPLICATION AND THAT JOINT STREAMLINED PROCESS. THIS IS ONE OF THE ACTIONS CALLED OUT IN THE TASK FORCE- AND I AND WE HAVE THE WORKGROUP ESTABLISHED. AROUND IT THAT ARE MOVING FORWARD- AND WE'VE ALREADY SEEN PROGRESS. FROM YEAH AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO WITH THE CHAMBER FIND WE'VE SEEN THE MEDIAN TIME OR- GREEN TREE CAMERAS REVIEWS. GO DOWN FROM SIX MONTHS TO ABOUT THREE MONTHS- AND- AND SO IN THAT TREND HELD OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WHICH IS. I'M GOOD PROGRESS MORE REMEMBER THAT SAID THAT JUDGING HER AS PLAINTIFF A C. CORP ONE POINT. AT THE MARCH WE'RE REALLY LOOKING NOW WE- ARE PERMITS TO. IS WHAT WE IN THE EARLY ACTION. SO I THE- R. THEY COUNTY P. I MENTION EARLIER THIS pWHO ARE. YOU KNOW SPEAKING- AND- IT A TWENTY MILLION EIGHT. PER EMPIRE. RIGHT ACROSS ALL OF THE NEW FAT HIGH. IS LANDING STATE SO SOCIALLY ANYTHING THAT THIS. IS FOR. A FIRE- HAS THIS. SECRET BEFORE SEACOAST. AFTER UP TO YEARS IF YOU DO HAVE. SOME TYPE OF A MORE. EXEMPTION OR- OTHER- FASTER I CATCH. THIS IS THE CAL MENTAL REVIEW. WORKING THE ADVICE. CAN A BOY IT DOWN. TO DOING JUST NEED THE COR BASIC- AND I JUST PUTS ON THE- IN ALLAH YOUR PROJECT HAS TO DO ANYWAY. I AND THIS- AND BRINGS THAT PROP DOWN TO ABOUT TWO MONTHS- DON'T ALLOW US TO A THE STEPS. OF THOSE EMPIRE PROTECT. WITHOUT IN THE LANKY. BUT WHAT'S REALLY IT'S- IS IT IS A FULLY SYNCHRONIZED PERMIT. THAT PART OFFICIAL. FULLY INTEGRATED THE PER STEVE- INTO. WITH THE COUNTY P. SO THAT ANYBODY APPLYING FOR ACROSS. CAN'T ACTUALLY HAPPEN EMPIRE IN THAT'S HOW. THAT WOULD STATE WATER BOARD SAID TO MY DOLLARS THAT WE FIND. EARLY ACTION. AND ABLE. TO STOP BY. WITH NAMES LIST S. WIDE HER NAY THAT IS FULL SYNC. WITH THE CALIBER. SO IT'S AUTOMATIC. HUGE TIME SAVER. IN THIS PROCESS I'M IN ANOTHER THING WE DID SO THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE COMFORTABLE USING IT- AND ENSURING THAT THEY UNDERSTAND HOW TO USE THAT. IS THAT WITH THE EARLY ACTION DOLLARS OUT WE ROLLED OUT A CONTRACT TO DO FORTY PROJECT SPECIFIC ANALYSIS SO ESSENTIALLY FORTY- CAL BTP APPLICATIONS- IN DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE TYPES AND GEOGRAPHIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO THAT ANYBODY IS GOING TO BE USING CAL BTP PROJECT- DOESN'T HAVE TO START FROM SCRATCH THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE. ALREADY DONE PROJECT TEMPLATES- IN YOUR REGION FOR THEIR VEGETATION THAT THEY CAN JUST FOLLOW I'M REALLY CLEARLY AND TAKE THE STEPS. IN ACTION STEPS THAT ARE OUTLINED- WHEN DOING THEIR PROJECTS SO IT'S AN INCREDIBLY FAST- PATH TO GETTING C. CHOIR AND A FULLY SYNCHRONIZED PERMIT. OKAY IS WAS THAT WAS THAT WAS A REALLY LONG ANSWER TO THE QUESTION. BUT I WHAT I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT THINGS SO CAL BTP ALL START THERE- YOU'RE RIGHT IN LA- JUST REPORTED TO US IN THIS HEARING. THAT IS NOT REALLY BEING UTILIZED VERY VERY MUCH AND- AND AS YOU SAID IT ONLY COVERS A STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA. WHICH IS A SMALL PORTION OF THE ACRES THAT WE NEED- TO ALTERNATELY TREATED IT'S IMPORTANT PORTION. BUT THE PEOPLE APPLYING FOR THAT ARE MOSTLY CAL ARE MOSTLY FIRE COUNCILS. NONPROFITS PUBLIC ENTITIES TRYING TO DO THAT WORK. AND THEY'RE REPORTING TO ME. AND OTHERS THAT THE PROGRAM IS TOO INFLEXIBLE AND BURDENSOME. AND THEY END UP OPTING FOR OTHER METHODS. AND SO VTP IS NOT BEING UTILIZED. AND IN FACT STREAMLINING. PROJECTS IN THAT AREA SO THAT'S A PROBLEM RIGHT NOW WITH V. T. P. WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO- YOU KNOW. T. H. FEES YOU KNOW TIMBER HARVEST PLANS THAT PRIVATES- SO YOU KNOW PRIVATE LOGGING COMPANIES OFTEN DO T. H. P.'S TO DO THEIR- TO DO THEIR- COMMERCIAL TIMBER. HARVEST- THEY A TAKE A REAL LONG TIME- AND OFTEN THE FOR IS THE GET A T. H. PERMIT YOU READY TO MOVE FOR AND THEN THE Y. BOARD COMES IN A SAYS ONE I GOT TO GET A PERMIT FROM US OR SOME OTHER ENTITY GETS ANOTHER AND SO THE WHAT THE STREAMLINING MONEY THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED BECAUSE FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. AND THEN WITH THE WITH THE DIRECTION FROM FOURTEEN NINETY TWO GOING BACK TO TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE. HOW DO WE STREAMLINED THAT SO THAT THEY CAN GET A T. H. P. THAT IS THAT CAN INCLUDES ALL THOSE PERMITS SO YOU CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT WORK. AND THEN FOR THE SMALL LANDOWNER THEIR BIGGEST PROBLEM IS THE COST OF DOING THE THP ITSELF IS SO GRAT THAT IT IT MAKES NO FINANCIAL SENSE TO DO IT. AND SO YOU HAVE A- ON THE PRIVATE LANDSCAPE THAT'S THE BIGGEST IMPEDIMENTS TO DOING. MORE OF THE WORK THAT I THINK WE ALL AGREE NEEDS TO BE DONE. AND SO I MEAN ARE WE DOING SPECIFIC THINGS TO. MAKE THAT HAPPEN YOU KNOW TO STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS ON THE THP SIDE. FOR BOTH YOU KNOW COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS IN SMALL LANDOWNERS. THEN AFTER QUESTION I'LL ASK- IF FOR ANY OF OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE QUESTIONS WE CAN COME BACK TO THE TO GALLAGHER IF YOU HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS I WANNA MAKE SURE WE GET EVERYBODY AND. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER SO AND LET ME ANSWER KIND OF BOTH PARTS HERE SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE- WERE AT. NOT COMPLETING BUDGET DOLLARS SO. THAT THE CURRENT STREAMLINING MONEY IN THE BUDGET IS SPECIFICALLY FOR- A WILDFIRE RESILIENCE PROJECTS- THAT ARE LIKE FUEL REDUCTION AND STRATEGIC FUEL BREAKS AND PRESCRIBED FIRE- AND SO THOSE ARE ALL PERMITS STREAMLINING AROUND THE CAL DTP. SO I'M NOT FUNDING TO MILLION IS FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD. WHICH FUNDS THEIR STAFF SO THAT THEY DO NOT CHARGE. AN EXTRA FEE FOR THE AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT PERMIT AND THAT GETS US AGAIN. THE FIRST FULLY SYNCHRONIZED- PERMIT IN CALIFORNIA IT IS A AT LEAST BIRDS PERCEIVE OR PROCESS I DON'T IS BECAUSE I TO MY LINK. BUT IT'S- IT IS IT IS THE CDC CHOIR. WATER BOARDS AND FISH AND WILDLIFE PERMITS ALL IN ONE APPLICATION WITH NO FEET. I'M AND THAT'S WHAT YOUR INVESTMENT HAS HELPED US DELIVER AND- AND DO SOMETHING INCREDIBLY INNOVATIVE IN THIS SPACE. WHAT SUPPORT FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY. AND AND AS MY COLLEAGUE AT THE L. A- MENTIONED. THIS PROCESS IS INCREDIBLY NEW. SO THE STATE WATER BOARD JUST PASSED- THAT AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT THIS JULY. SO THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY NEW PROCESS. AND AND DEAN YEAH IT FORTY FIVE TEMPLATES THAT ARE GOING TO HELP MAKE THIS. MORE USER FRIENDLY AND EASIER FOR PEOPLE. TO NAVIGATE- ARE ROLLING OUT AS WE SPEAK. SO IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO WE HOPE TO SEE THIS BEING. THE NORM THIS IS A MUCH FASTER PROCESS. AND I AND WE ARE EXCITED TO SEE IT ROLLING OUT I THINK. THAT I JUST JACK CONFIRMED WITH MY COLLEAGUES THERE'S- CURRENTLY YOU KNOW JUST DIE SEVENTEEN PROJECTS- IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS HAVE USED. CAL T. P. AND WE ANTICIPATE TO SEE A LOT MORE. ROLLING OUT IN THE FUTURE- AS THESE PROJECTS ARE FUNDED. AND- AND AS THESE ARE- LAID OUT. WEST ON THE CHAMBER HER OKAY IS FUNDED BY THAT IS. BACKROOM STREAMLINING PROCESS IS TACK WE HAVE THAT FOR MANAGED TASK MORE AS WE SPEAK A MECHANISM TO THERAPY IS CALTRAIN THIS ONLINE STUFF TIME WE'VE HOWEVER IN ONLINE SEEK A QUITE A LINK APPLE. CURRENTLY THAT THIS THEY TREES ONLINE NUMBER HARVEST PROCESS- IS PROUD. THE PMR IN A PERMITS OUR FOR HARPER WHICH AGAIN I'M TAKE ABOUT FIVE DAY TURN- AND WHAT WE'RE MORE TO SEE IS THE MA THAT WE THE CAL BTP. WILL MULTI AGENCY SINGLE PROCESS THEN AFTER OVER TO THE HARVEST PLANS WHEN I WITH THE CAL TREES ON APPLE PROCESS SO WE ARE EXCITED TO BE MOVING IN AFTER. AND AND GRATEFUL FOR THE COLLABORATION TO GET THERE BECAUSE WE ARE REALLY COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT GREEN TAPE AND PROCESS DOESN'T SLOW DOWN- OUR PROGRESS. NO THAT'S GOOD AND SO THE INTENT IS TO SAY. THE PROCESS THROUGH K. TREES AS WE- RIGHT. YEAH THAT IS THAT IS THE GOAL GREAT SECUREMENT. THANK YOU BUT WELL MR FONG AND THEN MISTER SMITH. I THINK THIS CHAIR- FIRST LET ME JUST THANK- THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AS WELL- WENT OUT OF MY- ACCOLADES- YOU CERTAINLY HAVE HAD A LOT TO DEAL WITH OVER THE PAST A FEW YEARS BUT OF COURSE THROUGHOUT YOUR WHOLE CAREER- JUST A JOB TO- TO DEPUTY TO. THE DEPUTY SECRETARY MORSE. THE GOAL IS STILL FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRES- TREATED FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THAT CORRECT. THE SCALING UP TO THAT SO WORKING THAT'S THE GOAL LAID OUT BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE OKAY SO WHERE HOW MANY ACRES HAVE BEEN TREATED SO FAR AS IS THAT IN THE STATE. SO I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE FORCE MANAGEMENT TASK FORCE IS LAYING OUT THE MILLIONAIRE- STRATEGY AND- AND IS HELPING US IDENTIFY WHICH OCCURS COUNT WHICH OCCURS- AND HOW WE ARE GOING TO GET TO. THOSE THOSE ACRES AND CHIEF PORTER MAY WANT TO ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT MORE IN TERMS OF- WHERE WE ARE RELATIVE TO THE TARGET. SURE I JUST WANNA KNOW WHERE WE ARE NOW MOVING FORWARD SO CHEAP WATER OR OR- OR MISSED MOST OF WHAT HOW MANY ACRES HAVE BEEN TREATED. NUMBER FONG LET ME LET ME- ANSWER THAT AS- BEST I CAN- WHAT CAL FIRE IS TREATING CURRENTLY AS I MENTIONED IS GOING INTO CAL MAPPER WE HAVE A CLEAR- PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT THAT IS. WHAT WE DON'T HAVE THE IS- SPECIFIC NUMBERS FOR ALL OF OUR PARTNERS- BECAUSE WE'RE STILL RECONCILING APPLES APPLES TO APPLES- TYPE OF- ACCOUNTING. BUT WHAT WE HAVE BEEN- ESTIMATED TO BE AT ON ON THE ON THE STATE SIDE IS BETWEEN. TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ALLEN. THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY. THOUSAND ACRES ON THE STATE SIDE. ON THE FEDERAL SIDE- THEY'VE BEEN ESTIMATING A RIGHT AROUND THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY TO THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY. FIVE BUT YET BUT THIS YEAR. YES CALL TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWO ONE- DISCLOSED AND LYFT ALL NUMBERS ARE LOWER BECAUSE OF THE FIRE ACTIVE SO I HAD THE. TWO FIFTY TO THREE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND. TWO THREE ON TWENTY THOUSAND ACRES- TREATED HOW MUCH OF THAT IS PRIVATE AND HOW MUCH HOW MUCH OF IT IS NOT PRIVATE- WHAT WHAT THE THREE THE THREE FORTY THREE SIXTY THAT I MENTIONED IS ALL FEDERAL. THE REST OF THAT IS IN STATE AND PRIVATE AND I DON'T HAVE THE BREAKDOWN ANYTHING THE CALGARY HOUSING IN CAL MAPPER- BY AND LARGE IS ON. PRIVATE LANDS WITH A SMALL PORTION OF THAT ON STATE LAND AS AS YOU KNOW STATE LANDS ARE ONLY 3% SURE OF THE- WE GET I'M FOR TO- AND IT'S IT. A BASELINE AND I APPRECIATE- YOU KNOW YOUR WORK I'M I'M JUST UNDERSTAND. AS WE MOVE INTO AS WE AS WE WE'VE GOTTEN THROUGH THE PART WHEN THE WORSE AS YOU HAD OUTLINED THE ONE OF THE WORST WILDFIRE YEARS WE'VE HAD. WHERE WE STARTING FROM. SO I CAN CLEARLY SEE THE STATE RIGHT NOW THAT. AT THIS VERY MOMENT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS DONE BUT TO A FIFTY THOUSAND THREE ON TWENTY THOUSAND ACRES TREATED WITH THE MAJORITY OF IT BEING DONE ON PRIVATE LAND. YES AND THAT'S THAT'S THOSE ARE THAT'S AN AVERAGE RANGE OVER THE LAST. THREE TO FOUR YEARS. OKAY SUPPOSED TO AND THEN A MY UNDERSTANDING LOOKING AT THE- THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE FORCED RESILIENCE ACTION PLAN THAT ABOUT TWO AND A FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES IS PRIVATE. MOST LIKELY. FIVE PROBABLY NOT ALL OF THAT STREET- IN THOSE YEARS BACK SO I HAVE SORTED INTO TWO BASKETS FEDERAL. AND PRIVATE RIGHT. WELL BASICALLY- ALTERNATELY GOING TO BE CAL FIRE'S- AND THE TASK FORCE'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR ACCOUNTING FOR THE STATE PRIVATE AND IT'LL BE THE FEDERAL THAT WILL- ACCOUNT FOR THE FEDERAL OKAY WHAT THOSE AS APPLE'S ALL INTO THE SAME BASKET SO WE CAN ACCOUNT FOR THEM AND BE ABLE TO ADJUST FEDERAL FUNDING THAT'S COUPLE WARM THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR STATE AND PRIVATE WORK AS WELL AS ON FEDERAL GROUNDS SO WE SO WE ARE ABLE TO YOU ARE REALLY- EIGHT THE PICTURE. AND HAVING BEEN SOMEBODY WHO LIVES THROUGH- THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT CAME IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR THE BEETLE KILL THERE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS PLUS I THINK IT ENDED UP BEING ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED OVER SEVEN ABOUT SIX. SIX YEARS- THAT MONEY THAT CAME IN- WITH THE GOAL POST KEPT MOVING FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ON WHERE WHAT KIND OF REPORTING WE NEEDED TO DO OVER TIME. WHILE WE'RE WORKING WITH AS I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY WITH- SERVICIOS IDENTIFYING WITH THE TASK FORCE IN PLACE AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I'M WORKING ON WITH MY STATE FORESTERS ACROSS THE NATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL HAVE. THE ABILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR AND UTILIZE PROCESSES WE HAVE IN PLACE. WHAT I FOUND IS THAT THE TASK FORCE IS LIGHT YEARS AHEAD OF ANY OTHER STATE IN THE SPACE AND WORKING WITH. THE REGIONAL FORESTER FROM THE FOREST SERVICE AND THE OTHER FEDERAL LAND. OUT MANAGEMENT AGENCIES. MAKE THAT A WE SO WE ARE. GOING TO DRIVE THIS ON THE NATION'S WATER. WHAT ARE THE GUY I. ONE ECHO WHAT THE CHAIRS AND RESEARCH NEED TO PUSH A FEDERAL PART FOR FUNDING AND WORK TO BE DONE ON THE FEDERAL LANDS. I THINK THE FRUSTRATION THAT THAT THAT WE HAVE AS- AT LEAST I'LL SPEAK FOR MYSELF IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE- HOW WE'RE- TRACKING WHAT WE'RE DOING AS A STATE. IS THAT AND I ASK THAT I ASKED I ASKED THIS QUESTION TODAY MAYBE YOU CAN ANSWER THIS AS WELL IS THAT WHAT IS SUCCESS. I LOOKED AT I MEAN ALL YOUR PRESENTATIONS OF AN INDEPENDENT FUNDING IS IMPORTANT. ALL THE PRESENTATIONS OF OUTLINED THE AMOUNTS BEING SPENT. BUT THE AMOUNTS DOESN'T DEFINE SUCCESS. IT'S THE AMOUNT AND THAT SOMETHING ELSE AT THE LOOK AT THIS TIME ANALYZE WHAT WAS. MENTIONED BY THE VILLAGE OF ANNA'S OFFICE IS ACRES TREATED. AND SO ARE WE TREATING THE ACRES NECESSARY. TO MINIMIZE THESE CATS ARE QUALIFIERS. AND AT THE VERY MOMENT AND WHETHER IT'S- CALVET RADIO OR WHATEVER THEY OUTLET IS OR EVEN FOR US IS THAT WE HAVING A HARD TIME. GETTING THOSE NUMBERS. I GUESS THE BROADER QUESTION IS CAN WE EVEN GET THESE NUMBERS IN REAL TIME. BECAUSE AS AT THE MEET YOU WE CERTAINLY ARE TRYING TO. ADDRESS THIS- SITUATION A VERY NARROW WINDOW I MEAN IS IT POSSIBLE TO TRACK ACRES TREATED IN A REAL TIME FASHION HIS CAL MAPPER THAT- IS THAT THAT THAT PLATFORM. FOUR FUEL REDUCTION TREATMENTS- RACKING EIGHTY HE- THE TIMELINE IS ON A MONTHLY BASIS AND CAL MAPPER IS UPDATED ON A MONTHLY BASIS. OKAY BUT I WASN'T ACCOUNT FOR IS LAG TIME IN REPORTING INTO CAL MAPPER SO IF INSPECTORS ARE OUT ON FIRES OR- OR MADE MR INSPECTIONAL- OVER FIRST ON A PROJECT OR OR HIT IT THAT DAY BEFORE ACTUALLY. FIVE HUNDRED ACRES WAS BURNT- BAND THAT WILL COME BACK INTO THE NUMBERS LATER SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS. I IT BLOCKS THE SCHOOL YEAR CLOSING WHAT WE HAVE TO RECONCILE OUR NUMBERS BEFORE WE WHAT I CALL TOMBSTONE THE ACTUAL NUMBERS FOR THE YEAR. IN AND AROUND SEPTEMBER BECAUSE OF ALL THOSE OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE GOING ON IN JUSTIFICATION OF THE OF THE ACTUAL ACRES THAT WERE TREATED IN THAT FISCAL YEAR SO THAT'S WHERE YOU GONNA SEE YES. RAPPER IS GOING TO GIVE YOU AN ABILITY TO GO ONTO THE CALIFORNIA WEBSITE OR TAG IN THROUGH THE TASK FORCE WEBSITE AND SEE WHAT THOSE NUMBERS ARE INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF PROJECTS NUMBER OF ACRES TREATED. ARE THERE WILL BE QUALIFIERS IN THEIR THAT EXPLAIN WHAT ALL THAT. HOW COULD. I GET THAT. WE JUST NEED TO KNOW THAT THE NUMBER OF ACRES TREATED QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO IMPROVE ON- THAT I GUESS MAYBE I'LL TURN TO A GO TO MY QUESTIONS TO MATT AND TO- JOHN IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM- FROM THE ADMINISTRATION I MEAN IS WHAT SHE'S SAYING THROUGH. THE MAIL ARE THESE PERMITS STREAMLINED BY THEY SYNCHRONOUS. YOU GUYS ARE THAT YOU GUYS REPRESENT MEMBERS WHO ARE USERS OF THIS ARE TRYING TO GET THESE PERMITS AND- TIMBER HARVEST PLANS- IS THE SYSTEM WORK. OKAY WORKS- YEAH AS FAR AS COUNTRIES GOES- THAT CERTAINLY IS HELPING BUT THAT AT THIS POINT IN TIME IS JUST AN ELECTRONIC WAY TO FILE A TIMBER HARVEST PLAN IT'S NOT SYNCHRONIZING WITH THE OTHER PERMITS AND WELL WE HEARD FROM JESSICA SETS A LONG TERM PLAN SO YEAH WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT BUT- WE'RE NOT QUITE THERE YET. YEAH MY CONCERN IS WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND- WE DO HAVE THIS TASK FORCE NOW AND THEY'RE WORKING ON IT SO- THANK. THEM FOR THEIR WORK THUS FAR AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THEM TO SEE THIS THROUGH TO COMPLETION. HOW COULD. I'M IS A DS. I WOULD AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES- IS PERMISSIBLE LININGS ON THE HAS BEEN TARGET FOR SOMETIME I THINK IT WAS MENTIONED FOURTEEN NINETY TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WHICH PERMIT STREAMLINING WAS WINE- JUST ONE OF THE MANY PRIORITIES- THAT PROCESSES BEEN ONGOING FOR A WHILE AND I WOULD ECHO JOHN'S- STATEMENT IN THAT- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MOVE FASTER- WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A BE HOLISTIC IN TERMS OF NOTING ALL THE NECESSARY PERMITTING TOGETHER. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS ON MAKING THAT HAPPEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. OKAY SO THEN I GUESS MY FINAL QUESTION GOING BACK. TO MS MOORE'S IS. IT THE ONLY PREDICTOR OF FUTURE BEHAVIOR IS. PAST BEHAVIOR. THEN WHAT. WHAT TRUST WE HAVE THAT THIS IS GONNA WORK. FOR CAL BTP AND CAL TREES. ASKED ABSOLUTELY SO WE'RE WITH THAT FOR MANAGEMENT FORCE ALREADY SEEING PROGRESS I IN THAT DO HAVE THE ACCOUNT ELECTRONIC PERMITTING- AND- MAYBE WE CAN ASK I- MSTS TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HIS PERSPECTIVE ON THE CAL BTP AS WELL I MEAN THEY BOTH ADDRESSED I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE TWO MARTYRS PLANS WE DO HAVE SOME PROGRESS TO BE MADE AND THAT'S WHAT OUR ACTIONS WITH THE TASK FORCE THAT WE ARE WORKING ON COLLABORATIVELY ON THE QALBI TIKI IS PROBABLY THAT. THEY'RE MORE PRESENT EXAMPLE. OKAY SO. A MUCH BY- BY THE ONE OF THE PREVIOUS PALACE AB FOURTEEN NINETY TWO. FROM TWENTY TWELVE- PROVIDED A CONSISTENT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR STAFF AND REVIEW OF TIMBER HARVESTING ACTIVITIES AND ONE OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS IS AN ANNUAL REPORT. DUE ON OR BEFORE JANUARY TENTH OF EACH YEAR- REGARDING THE- OUTLINING A REGARDING THE ACTIVITIES OF ALL STATE DEPARTMENTS AGENCIES AND BOARDS. RELATING TO FORCED INTO REGULATION. RIGHT SO NOT ONLY IS IT SUPPOSED TO CONTAIN THE CAUSES ISSUE WITH A VIEW BUT ALSO THE NUMBER OF PLANTS AND WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN. THIS REPORT. SINCE. TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO ARE WE GONNA GET ANOTHER REPORT. YES THOSE ARE FORTHCOMING- AND YOU SHOULD SEE THEM IN THE NEW YEAR AND- WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOU ARE WHERE YOU OF THEM AND DISCUSSING THEM WITH YOU. OKAY AND WE'RE GONNA GET EVERY YEAR. YES THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A BACKLOG- FROM THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AND- WE WERE IN THE PROCESS OF CLEARING THAT BACKLOG. WHEN I WAS PANDEMIC AND FIRE CRISIS THAT DIVERTED- EVERYONE AND WE'RE NOW- BACK ON TRACK SO YOU'LL BE GETTING A SERIES OF REPORTS SHORTLY. OKAY SOUNDS GOOD THANK YOU. MISTER SMITH THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SHOW UP LATE BUT THE MERCIA SOUTHWEST I'LL FOLLOW UP WITH THAT WITH THAT NO QUESTION JESSICA. IN REGARDS TO BE IN FIVE YEARS IN THE REAR BECAUSE THAT MEANS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AND BY JANUARY TENTH. OF TWENTY TWO ARE WE GONNA GET ALL FIVE OF THEM. FROM FIVE YEARS BACKLOG. YEAH WELL WE SHOULD BE CAUGHT UP BY EARLY IN THE NEW YEAR- THEY'RE ALL WRITTEN AND IN THE CLEARANCE PROCESS COMING OUT. SOON SO. WE'LL HAVE A LOT OF REPORTS AT TO ENJOY. OKAY AND THEN I JUST WANT TO PUT IT ANOTHER COULD ROSE INTO THE CHIEF. AND HIS RETIREMENT. HOME WELL SERVED OVER THE YEARS- PROBABLY IS A GOOD TIME AT THE LAST TWO YEARS OF WORK IN YOUR OF. TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY IN THESE FIRES THAT WE'VE HAD IN THIS. FIFTH BUT I WANTED TO ASK A QUESTION IN REGARDS TO THE CAL MAPPING. FOR THE CHIEF. IS THAT ALL ONLINE SO ANYONE IN THE PUBLIC CAN GO ONLINE AND LOOK AT THAT MAP AND SEE AS IT'S UPDATED EVERY MONTH THAT YOU SAID. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER YEAH IT IS. IT'S WIRED AND IT'S AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND SO YES. OKAY YEAH SERVICE FOLLOW UP FOR THAT. AND THEN I'M GONNA GO AHEAD SWITCHED GEARS TO. OF MET DIARSE WITHOUT FORESTRY ASSOCIATION DID I HEAR YOU CORRECTLY SAID ONE POINT FIVE MILLION. PEOPLE BOARD FEET BURNED. SO THE TWO NUMBERS I THREW OUT OVER ONE APPROX FREE ONE POINT FIVE BILLION BILLION BOARD FEET ARE PROCESSED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE DATA THAT WERE RUNNING THROUGH ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND THE DATA THAT WERE RUNNING THROUGH RIGHT NOW IT APPEARS THAT ON PRIVATE LAND WITHIN THE PERIMETER OF THE DIXIE FIRE THAT ONE POINT SIX BILLION BOARD FEET BURNED. WHAT IS THE COST OF ONE POINT SIX BILLION. BOARD FEET. IF THAT WAS ECONOMY IF WE WAS TABLED UP. OF MANAGE AND FORCED TO CUT INTO THE TIMBER WHAT WOULD BE THE REVENUE TWO OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESS AND DOLLAR VALUES WELL THAT'S IT THAT'S A COMPANY THAT THAT IS A BIT OF A COMPLICATED QUESTION BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MARKET THAT HAS DIFFERENT SPECIES IN YOUR TAX AND SO ON AND SO FORTH BUT OUR MEMBERS ARE ESTIMATING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS LOST AS IT RELATES TO THE DIXIE FIRE ALLOWED NOTWITHSTANDING THE SHEEP IN THE CALDOR AND THE NORTH COMPLEX FROM LAST YEAR IN THE AUGUST COMPLEX FROM THE YEAR BEFORE THAT LETTER. AND SAID THE YEAR BEFORE THAT LITERALLY WENT UP IN SMOKE. YEAH I MEAN WHAT WHAT THE THAT WHILE FAR IMPAIR ARE SOLD. ON INDUSTRY NOW THAT SOME OF OUR MEMBERS ARE ARE CLEARLY. EVEN CONTEMPLATING THEIR CONTINUED INVESTMENT FOR STRING CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE SEVERAL SEVERAL MEMBER COMPANIES THAT. HAVE LOST NEARLY HALF THEIR ASSETS IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND ARE. ON THE PRECIPICE OF BEING WIPED OFF THE MAP TO A CERTAIN EXTENT AND- YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE TO THINK ABOUT THIS AS IT RELATES TO- NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- CASCADES AND SIERRAS BUT- WE HAVE ONE OF OUR MEMBER COMPANIES LOCATED IN SANTA CRUZ JUST NORTH OF SANTA CRUZ CALIFORNIA. SMALL FAMILY ON MAIL BEEN THERE FOR. ALMOST EIGHTY YEARS OF NOT EIGHTY YEARS ALREADY AND- THE CZ ALIGNING COMPLEXES. ONE OF IT- EVENTS THAT HAS SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED THEIR ABILITY TO BE. I GUESS FLEXIBLE OR OPERATE AT ALL IN IN THE CLIMATE IN WHICH THEY'RE THRUST SO IF IT'S A PROBLEMATIC SHOULD CONTINUE INVESTMENT. AND CALIFORNIA FORESTRY IS I WOULD SUGGEST. QUESTIONED AT BEST. AND THEN PRETTY MUCH FOLLOWED UP WITH THE JESSICA'S COMMENTS THAT SHE'S TRYING TO STREAMLINE THE THREE PER PERMIT PROCESS AND DON'T WANT AND THEN IT SHOULD TAKE A COUPLE MONTHS WE'VE BEEN WAKE IT WENT PRETTY MUCH WORKING ON IT FOR TEN YEARS NOW CAN YOU KEEP US ABREAST IT INFORMED. IF THIS PROCESS DOES HAPPEN MAYBE JUNE OF TWENTY TWO AND NOT ANOTHER FIVE OR TEN YEARS THAT WE KEEP KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD SAY AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE BUREAUCRATS THAT WE'RE GONNA SAY WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT HAPPEN WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT HAPPEN. BUT IT NEVER HAPPENS. WE CONTINUE TO TRACK IT WILL BE HAPPY TO. PROVIDE YOU WITH ANY INFORMATION AS RELATES TO PROGRESS MADE AND I WILL NOTE THAT CALIFORNIA'S IS- IT'S REVOLVING THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE ONGOING RIGHT NOW DELAY TO TRY TO MOVE THE BALL FORWARD. I'M GETTING THERE'S STREAMLINING PROCESS THE CARACTERES PROCESS. FULLY MATURE WHERE WE ARE FULLY INVOLVED IN THAT OKAY AND THEN THOUGH I'LL GO AHEAD NEXT UP MISTER ANDERSON A QUESTION. DIRECTOR OF FORESTRY POLICY MENDOCINO REDWOOD COMPANY. HOW MANY ACRES DO YOU GUYS MANAGE. ARE WE MANAGE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND ACRES OF REDWOODS AND DOUGLAS FIR OKAY IN MANY FIRES IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND YOUR MANAGEMENT BAKERY TO TAKE CARE OF- I'M IN NO NOT LAST THREE YEARS THE LAST TIME WE WERE HIT HARDEST TWO THOUSAND EIGHT- WHEN WE HAD ROUGHLY. TWENTY SEVEN FIRE START OVERNIGHT DUE TO LIGHTNING SO MAYBE WE SHOULD CONTACT WITH YOU AND MAKE YOUR PERMITTED PROCESS IS REAL QUICK SO YOU CAN GET IT DONE AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE WILL NOT KEEP. LIKE WE'RE DOING MANAGING. JUST A COMMENT. FOR THAT STUFF. BUT I COULD. NOT I LIKE TO DISCUSSION I SHOWED UP LATE. BUT I REALLY THINK WE GOTTA GET TO THE POINT. IN CALIFORNIA MY ENVIRONMENTAL FRIENDS. THERE'S NO TREES FOR THE OWLS. THERE'S NOTE ANIMALS LEFT IN THE FOURTH DOCTOR. THAT ARE TAKING CARE OF WE GOT BEARS THAT ARE COMING DOWN AND NEIGHBORHOODS. WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO MANAGING OUR FOREST CONTAINING IT OUT. SO WE DON'T HAVE THE GIANT WILDFIRES IS IT SAID WHEN THE FIRE BROKE DOWN GOT ON THE GROUND. FIRE DIES OUT SO FIREFIGHTERS CAN MANAGE IT. THAT IS A KEY SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET INTO THAT. IN THE MONEY AND RESOURCES THAT WE'VE- SENT TO ALL THE DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE. THAT WE GET IT DONE. AND I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU- I JUST HAVE ONE QUICK COMMENT- FOR- MS QUINN DAVIDSON- AND IT. WHICH IS ACTUALLY JUST A REQUEST TO BE IN TOUCH WITH- MY STAFF WORK FOR MYSELF REGARDING THE INSURANCE ISSUE. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS RAPIDLY BECOMING A CRISIS I HEARD ONLY YESTERDAY- FROM A CONSTITUENT WHO'S- INSURANCE BILL WENT FROM TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN THIS. I THINK IN MY DISTRICT THERE TENDS TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A- ASSUMPTION THAT- EVERYBODY CAN AFFORD TO SELF INSURE OR AFFORD THAT KIND OF A INSURANCE BILL BUT IN FACT- THIS IS GOING TO FORCE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR HOMES. IF WE DON'T FIND A SOLUTION FOR IT. MR FONG DID YOU WANT TO. GET ON ON ON THAT AND I HAVE A QUESTION I FORGOT TO ASK- FOR BITCOIN DAVIDSON AND- YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU HAD A NUMBER OF- INDIVIDUALS HAD GONE THROUGH- CERTIFICATION BUT HAVEN'T GOTTEN APPROVED BY THE STATE CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT. IN TERMS OF WHAT THE HANG UP IS OR WHAT THE- IS THERE SOME WAY THAT WE CAN HELP WITH OR OR OR FACILITATE THAT BECAUSE WE DO NEED. FOR BUSES WE NEED MORE PRESCRIBED BURNING CAN YOU ELABORATE AND GIVE US MORE DETAILS ON THAT. YEAH THANK YOU I'M- SO. I THINK. THE HANG UP IS PRIMARILY IN CONVERSATIONS WITH CAL FIRE I THINK THIS IS A NEW PROGRAM- AND IT'S SORT OF FINE PEOPLE WHO ARE OUTSIDE OF THE AGENCIES ACTUALLY. PRIVATE PRACTITIONERS WHO DON'T WORK FOR CALIFORNIA DON'T WORK TO THE STATE. NECESSARILY AND SO I THINK THERE'S JUST A LOT OF ROOM TO GROWING PAINS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ROLL THIS PROGRAM OUT. AND HOW TO MAKE IT MAKE SENSE IF WITH THE SYSTEM THAT'S IN PLACE- THAT SAID I THINK IT'S ALSO BEEN KIND OF PUT ON THE BACKBURNER AND- AND NOT BEEN GIVEN THE ATTENTION THAT IT NEEDS AND- THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO WORK WITH CAL FIRE JUST TO. MAKE SURE TO ELEVATE THIS AND SAY. YOU KNOW THE CURRENT SYSTEMS THAT ARE IN PLACE ARE NOT GOING TO FACILITATE THIS PROGRAMS WE NEED TO RETHINK THOSE SYSTEMS BECAUSE- WE NEED THESE PEOPLE AND WE CANNOT WAIT ANOTHER YEAR WE CAN EVEN WAIT ANOTHER TWO MONTHS- WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN SO. I DAY I KNOW THEY JUST MET YESTERDAY I HAVEN'T HAD AN UPDATE ON NOT YET BUT I REALLY THINK IT'S ABOUT COMMITTING TO. TO A DIFFERENT WAY OF DOING THINGS AND IT'S A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE PROBABLY FOR THAT YOU KNOW PROFESSIONAL FIRE ORGANIZATION. BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. I CERTAINLY. YOUR A VIRGIN AND I APPRECIATE THE FOR THEM IN. THANK YOU. MISTER AND I JUST. DO I TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COM SO WE CAN. JUST A COUPLE QUICK FALL OF THE AND ON THE PRESCRIBED FIRE IN A THE GALLAGHER AT THE OTHER TO WANTED- A- ALASKA. SO SHE- SHOULD YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- AND MR FONG- FOR THE QUESTION I THINK I THINK- WHEN YOU'RE COVERED IT QUITE WELL- WITH RESPECT TO- THE PERSPECTIVES OF FROM A PRACTITIONER FROM A TRAINER OF- THE- PERSPECTIVES BURN BOSSES. WHAT NEEDS TO BE ALSO A PART OF THIS CONVERSATION IS THIS IS THE FIRST YEAR AND THAT. IS THE FIRST CLASS THAT'S BEEN UNDERTAKEN TO CERTIFY THESE NON AGENCY- BURN BOSSES WERE COMMITTED TO THE PROCESS WE'RE COMMITTED TO WORKING THROUGH- THE CERTIFICATION ISSUES BUT THE IF THE ISSUE IS THAT NONE OF THE- PURCHASE OFFENSE. WERE CERTIFIED AS MEETING THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS BEFORE THE CLASS STARTED NOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE GOING BACK AND DOING HISTORICAL RECOGNITION OF THOSE SKILLS AND ABILITIES THAT. THAT- WHEN YOU HAVE HAD NOT YOU. HI MISTER GALLAGHER BACKED YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OUT ON THEPRESCRIBED FIRE SIDE AGAIN- AT I THINK WE DID SOME GREAT WORK LEGISLATIVE. LEGISLATIVELY THIS YEAR THAT'S GOING TO HELP THAT IMPORTANT TOOL AND I THINK IT'S A KIND OF REDISCOVERING IN SOME WAYS THAT IMPORTANT TOOL- IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE- IN OUR PLAN LIKE DO WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY ACRES HE MIGHT TRY TO- TREAT WITH PRESCRIBED FIRE OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO. AND I'M NOT SURE WHO THAT QUESTIONS DEDICATED TO I WOULD LOVE TO CHIME IN ON IT FOR A MOMENT AND- EIGHT AS YOU'RE A LOT IN THIS. HEARING THAT QUESTIONS AROUND ACRES AND I AM A SUPER TYPE A PERSON AND LOVE NOTHING MORE THAN JUST BEING ABLE TO SIT DOWN AND COUNT SOMETHING UP- THANK YOU JUST ONE ADVOCATE FOR YOU ALL TO REMEMBER THAT THIS PROBLEM ISN'T AS SIMPLE AS JUST TELLING ACRES I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT IT'S ABOUT. YES IT'S ABOUT THE RIGHT ACRES AND GETTING THOSE ACRES OUT BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT A LOT OF QUALITY TO THINGS THAT ARE HARDER TO MAYBE WRAP OUR HEAD AROUND BUT CRITICAL LIKE. BUILDING A QUALIFIED WORKFORCE TO PLAY THESE APPROACHES IT'S ABOUT RESHAPING OUR ECONOMY SO THE PROFESSIONALS CAN EARN A LIVING WAGE IT'S ABOUT CHANGING FEDERAL AND STATE PROCUREMENT MECHANISMS THAT WE CAN DO THINGS IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE IT'S ABOUT. ADJUSTING STATE AGENCIES WAY OF DOING BUSINESS SO THAT YOU'RE NOT TRAINING CAPACITY BY NOT PAYING THEM FOR THE ACTUAL OVERHEAD REACH- I THINK THESE ISSUES ARE REALLY ABOUT INVESTING ORGANIZATIONAL TECHNICAL CAPACITY OF. OVER TWO HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS IN THE STATE WHO WANT TO BE AND WHO ARE PARTNERS TO DO THIS WORK BUT THERE'S FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURAL DESIGN PROBLEMS THAT STOPS THE BOTTLENECK RIGHT. THAT'S WHEN I SEE A WATERSHED CENTER WHEN I SIT DOWN TO ASK OUR FORRESTER ONE STOPPING YOU FROM TAKING ON MORE PROJECTS WHAT'S STOPPING YOU FROM DOING. WORK AT A GREATER SCALE THAT'S THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION I GOT FROM THOSE TWO HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THESE SIMPLE. THINGS LIKE OVERHEAD MIGHT SEEM REALLY I'M COMPILING IT MIGHT NOT BE AS LIKE POLITICAL BUT I THINK TAKE TAKE A STANCE ON IT SOMETHING LIKE PLANNING OR PERMITTING YOUR MONEY TO CONCORD SPENT. I JUST WANT TO SHARE YOU WITH YOU THAT THAT IS. THE WATERSHEDS PERSPECTIVE THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT'S REALLY STANDING LAMP. MORE GOOD WORK GETTING DONE- MALL TYPE APPROACH AND THAT'S KIND OF WHY. MY INITIAL. ON THE PROCESS AND LOT OF THINGS STAND IN WAY- BUT IS THERE AN ESTIMATE ON LIKE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO DO IN TERMS OF ESTIMATED A PRESCRIBED FIRE TREATMENTS. BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT. AND IF YOU GET TO KNOW LIKE WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO DO OVER THE NET IN THE IMMEDIATE. I CAN CHIME IN ON THAT- AND I TOTALLY SECOND WED ALISON SAID BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ACRES ST. IT'S REALLY ABOUT VESTING PEOPLE AND OF THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES BUT- THAT'S SAID THAT STRATEGIC- PLAN FOR PRESCRIBED FIRE THAT I MENTION OF THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE. HAS ONE BEEN WORKING NOT. CLEARLY OUTLINED SOME ACREAGE TARGETS FOR DIFFERENT ENTITIES SO FOR FEDERAL STATE PRIVATE PARTNERS. I'M SO YOU COULD LOOK TO THAT AND SEE SOME PRETTY SPECIFIC NUMBERS THAT ARE LAID OUT- I DID WANT TO CORRECT ONE THING THAT THE CHIEF PORTER SAID ABOUT THE- THE BURN BOSSES BECAUSE- YOU MENTIONED IT. BUT NO ONE WHO HAD A FIGHTER TAKING THE COURSE HAD MET TO MEET THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS AND- THAT'S NOT TRUE IT'S JUST- WE ACTUALLY HAD NINE PEOPLE IN THAT CLASS WHO ARE TYPE TWO. FEDERALLY QUALIFIED BURN BOSSES WITH DECADES OF EXPERIENCE SO ACTUALLY FAR EXCEED THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE STATE CERTIFICATION. I THINK IT'S JUST- WE'RE DEALING WITH MATCHING DIFFERENT SYSTEMS IN. CALIFORNIA HAS THEIR OWN SYSTEMS THEY DON'T REALLY- EASILY MERGE WITH THE FEDERAL QUALIFICATIONS OR WITH THE- PRIVATE SIDE SO I THINK. YOU KNOW THE OLYMPIAN HE'S OR CULTURAL ISSUES THAT NEED TO WORK AROUND BUT A LOT OF ITS WITHIN HEALTHCARE CULTURE AND THAT THEY'RE KIND OF SILO DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN SYSTEMS IN PLACE. AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RECOGNIZE OTHER WAYS OF DOING THINGS. INCLUDING THAT SOME KIND OF PRIMARY PRESCRIBED FIRE QUALIFICATION SYSTEM WHICH IS THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. SO I JUST WANT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS THAT WAS IN THERE. TO CLEAR THE WRECK MEANING SIR. INTO THE PRO. SO THAT'S WHAT'S DONE THERE WE'RE WE ARE READY. THOSE AS WE SPEAK- THERE'S A THE TEAM HAS BEEN PULLED TOGETHER. WHILE THEY'RE FOLLOWING THE- PROCESS THAT WAS PUT IN PLACE BY. THE TEAM THAT LANIER WAS A PARTNERSHIP THAT BUILT THIS PROGRAM. IT'S ALL ON PROGRESS. SO YOU MEANT THAT IS A QUICK QUESTION TO GET IS AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT WE'RE DOING BUT I'LL MOVE TO THE NEXT ONE REALLY I THINK WE CAN MAYBE DO THIS QUICKLY REALLY GOT TO WRAP THIS UP THE- FAST BECAUSE WE DO HAVE PEOPLE WAITING TO SPEAK AND- I WANT PM ADDRESS I'M BEING VERY FAST I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE OTHERS BUT I'M BEING VERY FAST FIVE HUNDRED HIGH PRIORITY FUEL BREAKS WE MOVED WE WENT FROM THE THIRTY FOUR THIRTY FIVE- IN THE PLAN WE IDENTIFY ONE MOVES UP TO FIVE HUNDRED WHERE WE HAD ON THAT CHIEF AND- IT WAS THE STATUS OF. OF DOING THOSE HIGH PRIORITY FUEL BREAKS. ON THE- CAL MAPPER WEBSITE- THE DASHBOARD SHOWS THE NUMBER OF PROJECTS THAT ARE IN PLAY- IN. A VERY US LEVELS OF TREATMENT. ARE THERE ARE OVER FIVE HUNDRED PROJECTS ON THAT CURRENTLY. IN THIS FISCAL YEAR AND THERE WERE LAST YEAR AS WELL SO. THAT WILL BE THE PLACE TO GO AND TRACK THAT. RIGHT WHEN YOU CROSS THE FISCAL YEAR IT'S GOING TO BE A SMALLER NUMBER JUST AT THE BEGINNING BUT IT. RAPIDLY RAMPS UP. OKAY AND THEN JUST ON THE WORK FORCE VERY QUICKLY A DEGREE THAT'S A BIG PART OF THIS- MAYBE TO JESSICA. EXPERTS SORRY. DEPUTY SECRETARY MORSE- THE- THE CCC SEEMS TO ME TO BE A VERY BIG PARTNER. IN HELPING TO DEVELOP THAT. BUT THEY'VE BEEN ACTUALLY CUT BACK THAT RECENTLY I MEAN ARE WE PLANNING TO REALLY. TRY TO REINVIGORATE THAT AND EVEN EVEN THE PRISON CAMPS. I THINK IT'S BEEN A REALLY GOOD PROGRAM WE SHUT ONE DOWN THIS YEAR- YOU KNOW THAT'S- YOU KNOW FOR PEOPLE COMING OUT- THE OF PRISON AND WANTED TO DEVELOP NEW SKILLS AND GET INTO LIKE. A TRADE IN THE FIELD- THAT HAS BEEN AND I THINK A PROVEN SYSTEM. ONE THAT'S BEEN RECOGNIZED BUT THEY GOT BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE BUT- WE'RE SCALING BACK ON THAT ARE THOSE. ARE WE PLANNING TO KIND OF. RE INVEST IN THOSE PROGRAMS- ACTUALLY. BY FOR THE CONSERVATION CORPS IN THE WILDFIRE SPACE- FROM FIVE MILLION DOLLARS I IN THEIR BASE FUNDING FOR FORCED RECORD TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET. I'M WE ALSO INVESTED SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN CHICO- THAT RELAUNCHING THEIR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROGRAM ONE OF THE CONSTRAINING FACTORS WITH THE CONSERVATION CORPS. HAS BEEN AND THEIR LACK OF BED CAPACITY AND SO THIS HELPS INCREASE- CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT WILL- GET THEM MORE SPACE TO BE ABLE TO BRING IN NEW RESIDENTIAL CENTERS- AND EXPAND THE CAPACITY.

BOTH YOU GETTING US AID WELL TRAINED WORKFORCE IN THE SPACE BUT ALSO- SERVE AS SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES RIGHT HERE THEY ARE BRINGING IN OFTEN. USE HILL- HAVE HAD FEWER OPPORTUNITIES- AND THEY ARE COMING INTO A SPACE WHERE THEY ARE GETTING STRUCTURE SUPPORT- AND JUST DOING INCREDIBLE WORK I AM JUST CONSISTENTLY IMPRESSED. WITH THE CONSERVATION CORPS YOUTH THAT I NEED OUT IN THE FIELD AND THEIR DEDICATION TO THE S. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE RETAIN THEM- WITH THESE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT DOLLARS INTO CAREER PATHWAYS. I'M ANOTHER LARGE SUCCESSES ACTUALLY BEEN SOME OF THE TRAINING PROGRAMS AROUND- FORMER INMATES SO THE MENTOR TRAINING CENTER IS A REALLY GOOD MODEL. THAT I WOULD POINT YOU TOWARDS- THE WHERE IT'S A COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE CONSERVATION CORPS CAL FIGHTER ON THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS.

SURE MEMBERS DANIEL BRADHAM OF THE CLUB CALIFORNIA. WE APPRECIATE THE AND THAT THAT THE GUY AND THE LEAD IT'S MADE AND COMMUNITY HARMING AND DEFENSIBLE SPACE WORK WE KNOW THAT BE ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO SAVE LIVES AND PROPERTY DURING A WILDFIRE. THEREFORE WE BELIEVE THAT FUNDING FOR FUEL REDUCTION ACTIVITIES THAT ARE CURRENT MILE BAND AND THEN THE WAY WE- SHOULD BE TIED TO FUNDING THAT ENSURE THAT A CRITICAL MASS OF HOMES AND NEARBY COMMUNITIES. ARE HARD AND HAVE SUFFICIENT DEFENSIBLE SPACE THAT SO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE IS SPENDING MONEY. IT'S MONEY. AND WAYS THAT ARE DARREN TO MAKE COMMUNITIES SAFER DURING INCREASINGLY COMMON WIND DRIVEN FIRES. WHEN THE STATE IS SPENDING MONEY IN THE WILDLAND FOR ECOLOGICAL PURPOSES IT SHOULD PRIORITIZE MANAGEMENT THAT WILL PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND CLOSELY MIMIC NATURAL WILDFIRES. IN THE NORTHERN PART STORAGE TO STAY SHOULD PRIORITIZE PRESCRIBE AND MANAGE FIRES. FINALLY WE HEARD A LOT TODAY ABOUT BIOENERGY AND WHAT PRODUCT PRODUCTS WHICH DAY SHOULD BE PRIORITIZING NON EMITTING USAGE FOR BIOMASS ADDITIONALLY THE STATE SHOULD MAKE SURE THE BIOMASS UTILIZATION PROJECTS THAT BENEFIT FROM PUBLIC FUNDING. ARE ACTUALLY USING BIOMASS BUT IT'S COMING OUT OF THE FOREST AS A RESULT OF ACTIVITIES THAT WILL IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY OR COLLEGE. THE STATE CURRENTLY SOURCES RATEPAYERS TO PURCHASE ENERGY FROM BIOMASS FACILITIES AT EXORBITANT PRICES IN THE BIO GRAHAM PROGRAM. YET THESE FACILITIES BURN ALMOST ENTIRELY COMMERCIAL MOCKING WASTE WHICH IS NOT REMOVED FOR WILDFIRE. MITIGATION OR PUBLIC SAFETY. NEEDLESS TO SAY THE IS NOT GREAT TAX. OR GIGI R.
