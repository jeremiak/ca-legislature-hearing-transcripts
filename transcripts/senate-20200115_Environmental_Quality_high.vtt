00:16:55.114 --> 00:16:57.282

ALL THESE CONCERNS ABOUT THE

00:17:08.761 --> 00:17:11.430
DAY IN THE COTTON AND TAKE OUR

00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:13.198

00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:33.452
POINT ONCE WE VOTE ON THREE

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:34.219
SEVEN TWO AND IT BECOMES LAW

00:17:34.286 --> 00:17:35.554
OKAY THAT'S WHAT I MEANT I WAS

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:36.155

PRIVATE PROPERTY NOT GOVERNMENT.

00:17:43.595 --> 00:17:46.698
WHETHER IT'S AN OLD IT'S A GOOD

00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:49.635
IDEA IS RE USABLE. BOTTLES AND

00:17:49.701 --> 00:17:50.636
WHAT THEY'VE GONE IN INTO THESE

00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:51.970
CRAFT FOR REASON THEY GIVE ME A

00:17:52.037 --> 00:17:52.638
BREAK BECAUSE IT'S A LOWER COST

00:17:52.704 --> 00:17:53.205
FOR THE CRAFT BREWERIES THE

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:54.640
DESIGN THIS IS SOME SORT OF

00:17:54.706 --> 00:17:56.175
WHAT I DON'T KNOW HOW IT THAT

00:17:56.241 --> 00:17:57.643
BUT THEY DECIDED ALL THE CRAFT

00:17:57.709 --> 00:17:59.912
BREWERS AGREED THAT THIS IS

00:17:59.978 --> 00:18:01.647
GOING TO BE THE BEER BOTTLE OF

00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:03.549
OREGON RIGHT. WE CAN DUPLICATE

00:18:03.615 --> 00:18:05.584
WE CAN COPY IT FOR WHATEVER AND

00:18:05.651 --> 00:18:07.786
THEY IN THEIR FIRST YEAR WHEN

00:18:07.853 --> 00:18:10.055
THEY START THIS DAY THEY'VE GOT

00:18:10.122 --> 00:18:11.123

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:15.160
SIX MILLION BY YEAR THREE

00:18:15.227 --> 00:18:16.328
OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN LOOK AT

00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:18.964
CALIFORNIANS SAY THE SAME

00:18:19.031 --> 00:18:19.565
THING. SO WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT

00:18:19.631 --> 00:18:22.935

CONTAINERS YOU KNOW THAT THE

00:18:28.907 --> 00:18:30.375

WINE INDUSTRY HAS COME TO THEM

00:18:46.391 --> 00:18:47.292
VOLUNTARILY BECAUSE ORGANS GOT

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:50.562

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:56.468
TO STATE. CUT PLACE THAT A WAR

00:18:56.535 --> 00:18:57.102
TO DO IT SO THEY'RE NOT PART OF

KNOW THE HAVE BALLS WITH

00:19:02.574 --> 00:19:03.575
THEY'RE GOING TO DESIGN THEIR

00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:04.877
WHOLE THING SAID THAT- SO

00:19:04.943 --> 00:19:06.612
PEOPLE DRINK LAST. DRINK

00:19:06.678 --> 00:19:07.579
RESPONSIBLY SO IT'S GONNA BE A

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:09.014
HALF BOTTLE THAT THEY WANT TO

HAVE IT GO WIN SO THERE AGAIN

00:19:13.018 --> 00:19:15.821
CLOSING THAT LOOP. AND THE

00:19:15.888 --> 00:19:19.391
CARBON BENEFIT. IS A FRACTION

00:19:19.458 --> 00:19:21.126
AS IT SAYS RIGHT THERE OF THE

00:19:21.193 --> 00:19:23.729
EVEN OF THE RECYCLE GLASS IT'S

00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:25.030
ONE OF THOSE THINGS AS WE IT'S

00:19:25.097 --> 00:19:27.866
ALL HANDS ON DECK AND WITH THE

ON BREWERIES OF MICRO BREWERIES

00:19:33.205 --> 00:19:34.840
AND WINERIES AND THIS

00:19:34.907 --> 00:19:36.074
REASONABLE HERE FROM SOME OF

FOR MAJOR REFORM LAID OUT THREE

00:24:37.709 --> 00:24:40.512
PRINCIPLES FIRST TO IMPROVE

BILL ALSO ALLOWS FULL. I'M AN

00:30:31.996 --> 00:30:33.865
AMENDMENT IN THE DEPOSIT LEVEL

00:30:33.932 --> 00:30:35.733
THAT WILL ALLOW AND THAT TO BE

STRATEGY- REQUIREMENT. SO IN IN

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.213
ESSENCE WE SUPPORT THE BILL

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:48.780
IT'S NICE TO MOVE THAT THAT

00:30:48.846 --> 00:30:50.982
RESPONSIBILITY MODEL I'M AND

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:51.716
I'M BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE

00:30:51.783 --> 00:30:53.384
SOME. AMENDMENTS THE NEEDING TO

00:30:53.451 --> 00:30:57.989
THE CURRENT DRAFTING TO MAKE IT

00:30:58.056 --> 00:30:58.590
A SEAT WILL BILL FIVE EXIST BY

00:30:58.656 --> 00:31:04.596
THAT IN CALIFORNIA. I'M SORRY

00:31:04.662 --> 00:31:05.230
MISTER CHAIR I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW

THIS IS JAMIE QUIRK. FROM

00:31:07.265 --> 00:31:08.866
CONSUMER WATCH I DIDN'T LOOK

00:31:08.933 --> 00:31:09.467
OVER I WAS SO GALVANIZED ON MY

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:14.138
SLIDES. MY NEXT WITNESS. HI

00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:14.939
JAMIE COURT PRESIDENT CONSUMER

00:31:15.006 --> 00:31:15.940
WATCHDOG I'LL KEEP IT REAL

00:31:16.007 --> 00:31:16.541
SIMPLE YOU KNOW CALIFORNIANS

00:31:16.608 --> 00:31:17.175
PAY ABOUT A BILLION AND A HALF

00:31:17.242 --> 00:31:17.742
DOLLARS IN NICKELS AND DIMES

00:31:17.809 --> 00:31:19.143
AND WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE LESS

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:21.412
THAN HALF BACK THE OFFICIAL

00:31:21.479 --> 00:31:23.114
REDEMPTION STATE THE NUMBER

00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:25.283
FROM CAL RECYCLE NOW IS SIXTY

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.883
EIGHT PERCENT. WE BELIEVE IT'S

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:28.453
ACTUALLY LOWER. IN OREGON IT'S

00:31:28.519 --> 00:31:31.222
THE 1% IN MICHIGAN IT'S 89% IN

00:31:31.289 --> 00:31:35.927
GERMANY IT'S 98% AND THE REASON

00:31:35.994 --> 00:31:37.295
IS BECAUSE THEY ALL DO ONE

00:31:37.362 --> 00:31:39.464
THING THAT WE DON'T DO AND IT'S

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:40.765
WE TELL THE BEVERAGE COMPANIES

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:42.133
THAT ARE PROFITING FROM THE

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.568
RAPPERS FROM THE CANS BOTTLES

00:31:43.635 --> 00:31:45.236
THAT THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:31:45.303 --> 00:31:47.071
RECYCLING THAT IS THE CONCEPT

00:31:47.138 --> 00:31:47.972
BEHIND THE BILL THAT WE

00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:49.907
SUPPORT. AND WE THINK SHOULD

00:31:49.974 --> 00:31:52.010
MOVE FORWARD AND BECOME LAW AND

00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:52.977
I THINK EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO

00:31:53.044 --> 00:31:55.413
OPPOSE THIS BILL SUPPORT THAT

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.182
CONCEPT SO I REALLY THINK AS WE

00:31:58.249 --> 00:32:00.184
MOVE FORWARD THAT'S THE CONCEPT

00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:02.353
TO KEEP IN MIND THERE ARE

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.055
THINGS WE WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE

00:32:04.122 --> 00:32:05.657
ABOUT THIS BILL AND WE HOPE DO.

00:32:05.723 --> 00:32:07.292
LIKE ALL RETAILERS HAVE TO

00:32:07.358 --> 00:32:10.561
ACCEPT. I WAS ON CAMPUS. AS WE

00:32:10.628 --> 00:32:11.162
BUY BOTTLES AND CANS IN RETURN

00:32:11.229 --> 00:32:11.929
IN THE SAME PLACE THAT WORKS.

00:32:11.996 --> 00:32:12.830
IT'S SIMPLE IT'S CONVENIENCE

00:32:12.897 --> 00:32:14.332
WOULD LIKE THAT TO BE IN THIS

00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:16.768
BILL. WE'D LIKE TO SEE-

00:32:16.834 --> 00:32:18.269
CURBSIDE HOLLERS WERE GETTING

00:32:18.336 --> 00:32:20.204
PAID NOW FOR TWELVE PERCENT. OF

00:32:20.271 --> 00:32:21.205
OUR NICKELS AND DIMES NOT GET

00:32:21.272 --> 00:32:22.907
THAT PAYMENT. BECAUSE THEY

00:32:22.974 --> 00:32:24.275
DON'T GET IN ANYWHERE ELSE AND

00:32:24.342 --> 00:32:25.743
THEY'RE NOT AUDITED I GOT TO

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.078
TALK TO COVER CYCLE ABOUT IT.

00:32:27.145 --> 00:32:28.680
BUT THE CONCEPT OF THIS BILL IS

00:32:28.746 --> 00:32:32.016
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND IF

00:32:32.083 --> 00:32:32.583
WE CAN ALL KEEP THAT IN MIND

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:33.117
EVEN AS YOU'RE HEARING THE

00:32:33.184 --> 00:32:34.752
OPPOSITION. IT'S REALLY

00:32:34.819 --> 00:32:35.820
IMPORTANT TO THE LAST THING

00:32:35.887 --> 00:32:37.055
I'LL SAY THAT I HOPE HAPPENS

00:32:37.121 --> 00:32:38.189
WITH THIS BILL HOPE HAPPENS

00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:39.090
THIS YEAR IS THERE ARE

00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:40.091
RECYCLERS WE HAVE HALF THE

00:32:40.158 --> 00:32:42.493
RECYCLING CENTERS WE DID. YOU

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.962
KNOW A DECADE AGO- AND- THEY'VE

00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:46.264
CLOSED BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT AN

00:32:46.331 --> 00:32:47.999
ADEQUATE PAYMENTS ARE HIGHER

00:32:48.066 --> 00:32:49.133
RENT THEIR SARS MEN WHICH BUT

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:49.767
THE ONES THAT HAVE. HIGH

00:32:49.834 --> 00:32:51.035
QUALITY HIGH VOLUME THESE ARE

00:32:51.102 --> 00:32:53.171
CENTERS THAT ARE PRODUCING. AND

00:32:53.237 --> 00:32:53.938
THEY EXIST IN THE SYSTEM THEY

00:32:54.005 --> 00:32:56.074
SHOULD BE REWARDED. AND UNTIL

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.042
WE TRANSITION TO THE SYSTEM WE

00:32:58.109 --> 00:33:01.079
NEED TO PAY THEM. WE GOT THREE

00:33:01.145 --> 00:33:01.679
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN THE

00:33:01.746 --> 00:33:05.683
BANK FROM HUNDRED TEAM DEPOSIT.

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:06.918
LET'S PAY THEM TO KEEP DOING

00:33:06.984 --> 00:33:09.520
THIS JOB AND WE'LL- DO THIS NEW

00:33:09.587 --> 00:33:12.256
SYSTEM. LET'S MAKE SURE. THAT

00:33:12.323 --> 00:33:14.425
THEY HAVE FIRST DIBS. WITH

00:33:14.492 --> 00:33:15.560
THEM. AND I THINK IF WE- WERE

00:33:15.626 --> 00:33:16.861
GONNA REDUCE A LOT OF THE

00:33:16.928 --> 00:33:18.229
OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL. AND

00:33:18.296 --> 00:33:19.597
WE'RE GONNA CHANGE ASSISTANCE

00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:21.699
TO PEOPLE OR IN A 90% RETENTION

THE VISION FOR THE NEW PROGRAM

00:41:31.789 --> 00:41:34.859
THAT WOULD GO INTO PLACE IN

00:41:34.925 --> 00:41:35.426
TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WERE ALSO

DOLLARS OVER THE LAST SEVEN

00:42:03.587 --> 00:42:04.822
YEARS AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE

00:42:04.889 --> 00:42:06.557

00:42:06.624 --> 00:42:09.526
WHERE THE PAYMENTS ARE DOWN 20%

00:42:09.593 --> 00:42:11.629

MAKE THAT VERY REAL FOR WHY

00:44:12.049 --> 00:44:14.918
THAT PROBABLY IS- IF YOU DID

00:44:14.985 --> 00:44:17.054

THE INCIDENT ALL OF YOU BE IN

00:44:38.375 --> 00:44:40.844
ONE OF ACCESS TO RECYCLING. WE

00:44:40.911 --> 00:44:41.445
FEEL THE DIALOGUE NEEDS TO BE

00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:42.513
FOCUSED ON TWELVE ACCESS TO

00:44:42.579 --> 00:44:44.681
RECYCLING THE CURBSIDE PROGRAM

00:44:44.748 --> 00:44:47.484
WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON THAT-

00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:50.454
I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE.

00:44:50.521 --> 00:44:51.388
MOVING BEYOND THE DEPOSIT

00:44:51.455 --> 00:44:52.723

THIS INSTANTLY COMPLEX AND

00:45:01.231 --> 00:45:03.267
ANTIQUATED SYSTEM THAT WE

00:45:03.333 --> 00:45:05.169
CURRENTLY EXPERIENCE WITH THE

EXISTING BOTTLED. SO I CAN SEE

00:45:08.505 --> 00:45:09.940
THAT WE FIND IT UNFORTUNATE

00:45:10.007 --> 00:45:11.975
THAT THIS BILL WAS INTRODUCED-

00:45:12.042 --> 00:45:13.143

DISTRACT FROM THAT

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:31.028

MARK A PRAYER I'M HERE ON

00:45:48.645 --> 00:45:50.914
BEHALF OF REPUBLIC SERVICES AND

ON THE MEASURE BUT AS WE'VE

00:45:55.252 --> 00:45:57.688
EXPRESSED TO THE AUTHOR WITH

00:45:57.754 --> 00:45:59.423
WHOM WE HAVE A GREAT

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:00.891
RELATIONSHIP A GREAT DEAL OF

00:46:00.958 --> 00:46:03.093
RESPECT WE DO HAVE SOME

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:04.828
CONCERNS WITH THE MEASURE AND

00:46:04.895 --> 00:46:06.497
WE'D LIKE TO EXPRESS THOSE. TO

00:46:06.563 --> 00:46:09.466
THE COMMITTEE. I THE CONCERNS

00:46:09.533 --> 00:46:12.402
THAT WE HAVE IS THAT- I THINK

00:46:12.469 --> 00:46:14.705
THAT THE C. R. V. PROGRAM

00:46:14.771 --> 00:46:16.607
CERTAINLY HAS ITS PROBLEMS AND

00:46:16.673 --> 00:46:19.143
HE THAT IS. WITHOUT THE NILE-

00:46:19.209 --> 00:46:21.879
BUT THAT DESPITE THESE PROBLEMS

00:46:21.945 --> 00:46:23.580
THE CURRENT CRV PROGRAMMING

00:46:23.647 --> 00:46:25.649
CALIFORNIA ACCORDING TO CAL

00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:29.052
RECYCLES LATEST FIGURES. IS

00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:30.087
SEVENTY FIVE POINT EIGHT

00:46:30.154 --> 00:46:32.389
PERCENT. RECYCLING RATE. THAT

00:46:32.456 --> 00:46:34.892
IS HIGHER THAN ANY E. P. R.

00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:36.360
PROGRAM IN THE STATE OF

00:46:36.426 --> 00:46:39.830
CALIFORNIA. AND SO WHEN PEOPLE

00:46:39.897 --> 00:46:42.833
POINT TO OREGON THE SUCCESS IN

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:44.535
OREGON IN OUR OPINION IS NOT

00:46:44.601 --> 00:46:46.937
BECAUSE OF THE ARE IT IS

00:46:47.004 --> 00:46:49.907
BECAUSE IT'S AT TEN CENTS. AT

00:46:49.973 --> 00:46:51.875
AND THAT THAT TEN CENT

00:46:51.942 --> 00:46:56.246
REDEMPTION BY YOU IS WHAT IS

00:46:56.313 --> 00:46:58.415
CAUSING THAT SUCCESS TO A IT

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:02.419
THE E. P. R. OP. ART CONCERN

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:03.453
SHOULD BE EXPRESSED THIS WAY

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:04.621
THAT CALIFORNIA HAS A FORTY

00:47:04.688 --> 00:47:06.557
MILLION OF POPULATION OREGON

00:47:06.623 --> 00:47:08.859
HAS FOUR MILLION. AND THOSE

00:47:08.926 --> 00:47:11.228
COMPARISONS ARE IMPORTANT NOT

00:47:11.295 --> 00:47:12.863
ONLY IN TERMS OF SIZE BUT THE

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:15.799
DIVERSITY OF THE POPULATION AND

00:47:15.866 --> 00:47:18.535
THE LARGENESS OF THE GEOGRAPHY

00:47:18.602 --> 00:47:19.770
IN CALIFORNIA COMPARED TO

00:47:19.836 --> 00:47:21.471
OREGON. AND SO AT THE END WE'D

00:47:21.538 --> 00:47:23.840
LIKE TO SAY THAT WE WOULD BE

00:47:23.907 --> 00:47:25.909

THEY DO. I THINK THAT THAT TO

01:08:56.131 --> 01:08:58.534
SAY THE WITH THAT. OF A-

01:08:58.601 --> 01:09:00.436
POPULATION OF FORTY MILLION CAN

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:02.204
CAN MOVE TO OREGON DID. WHICH

01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:05.841
IS A MIX OF OUR POPULATION LESS

01:09:05.908 --> 01:09:09.545
MILLION IN AND IN. TEN MONTHS

01:09:09.612 --> 01:09:11.714
IS NOT REALISTIC OR POSSIBLE

01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:12.281
AND THE BUILDER EVEN IF IT

01:09:12.348 --> 01:09:13.182
TAKES EFFECT NEXT YEAR IT'S AN

01:09:13.249 --> 01:09:14.149
OCTOBER FIRST TWENTY TWENTY

01:09:14.216 --> 01:09:16.252
ONE. SO WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:17.753
THAT THERE'S- FIRST FALL ANY

01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:18.954
REAL REASONABLE WAY TO EXPECT

01:09:19.021 --> 01:09:20.422
EVER TO HAVE THE DISTRIBUTORS

01:09:20.489 --> 01:09:22.291
BECOME. DISORGANIZATION AND

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:23.726
SPEND. YOU KNOW SENATOR WHITE

HOUSE HIS DREAM FOR THE LAST

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:26.962
FOUR YEARS TO DO THIS SO I'M

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:29.598
AND WE FRANKLY. DISAGREE AND WE

01:09:29.665 --> 01:09:31.200
DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE THE

01:09:31.267 --> 01:09:33.435
RESOURCES OR THE ABILITY TO DO

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:35.738
IT AND WE DON'T CERTAINLY DON'T

01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:38.073
HAVE CONTROL OVER THE PACKAGING

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:38.707
THAT IS BEING DEVELOPED. PLUS

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:42.177
ARM OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH

01:09:42.244 --> 01:09:45.047
THE EXISTING LAW. THAT WE HAVE.

01:09:45.114 --> 01:09:46.015
PACKAGING THAT IS COMING FROM

01:09:46.081 --> 01:09:46.782
OTHER STATES THAT THE MONEY WAS

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:48.784
NEVER RECEIVED HERE AND THAT'S

01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:49.785
AND THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT. N

01:09:49.852 --> 01:09:51.720
FORCE A LAW YOU'D YOU'D HAVE A

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:54.390
LOT BETTER PACKAGING THERE OR

01:09:54.456 --> 01:09:55.891
CONTROLLED IN WHAT WE DO NOW

01:09:55.958 --> 01:09:57.660
BUT BUT FRANKLY IT'S IT. IS NOT

01:09:57.726 --> 01:10:00.129
ENFORCEABLE. OKAY THAT'S YOUR

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:00.963
FOR MISTER QUINN AND I JUST WAS

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:02.164
IN A DOLLAR FOR THE SENATE

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:03.899
RIGHT HILL AND SENATOR STERN IS

01:10:03.966 --> 01:10:06.001
GONNA GET AYE I JUST WANTED TO

01:10:06.068 --> 01:10:08.737
SAY THAT. WE FEEL THAT THE

01:10:08.804 --> 01:10:09.905
CENTRAL CONCEPT OF THIS BILL.

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:11.240
IS RIGHT THAT BEVERAGE

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:12.508
COMPANIES HAVE TO TAKE

01:10:12.575 --> 01:10:13.642
RESPONSIBLE. THE PRODUCTS WE

01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:14.577
THINK COMPANIES YOU MEAN

01:10:14.643 --> 01:10:18.080
DISTRIBUTORS THIS PRODUCERS.

01:10:18.147 --> 01:10:18.681

KNOW PEOPLE CAN REALLY

01:10:19.214 --> 01:10:21.016
DIFFERENT A- WELL IN THE BILL

01:10:21.083 --> 01:10:22.451
IF YOU USE A RAP OR PRODUCT TO

01:10:22.518 --> 01:10:23.686
SELL A PRODUCT YOU'RE

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:25.120
RESPONSIBLE FOR BASICALLY

01:10:25.187 --> 01:10:26.522
MAKING SURE IT'S RECYCLED. AND

01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:29.158
THE POINT IS THAT IF WE GO WITH

01:10:29.224 --> 01:10:29.692
THE CONCEPT THAT MAKES THE

01:10:29.758 --> 01:10:32.628
PEOPLE WHO ARE PROFITING. FROM

01:10:32.695 --> 01:10:35.631
THE SALE OF- THE PRODUCTS IN

01:10:35.698 --> 01:10:36.131
THOSE IN THOSE IN THOSE

01:10:36.198 --> 01:10:39.802
BEVERAGES. BE RESPONSIBLE WE

01:10:39.868 --> 01:10:41.270

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:42.771
THAT'S 98% BECAUSE THEY DID IN

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:45.140
GERMANY OR 89% BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:10:45.207 --> 01:10:46.408
DOING IT IN AN ARGUMENT

01:10:46.475 --> 01:10:48.477
MICHIGAN AND- ALL THE DETAILS

01:10:48.544 --> 01:10:49.979
THAT ARE GOING THAT WE TALK

01:10:50.045 --> 01:10:51.981
ABOUT NOW I REALLY JUST WANT TO

REEMPHASIZE AS CONSUMER

01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.650
WATCHDOG IS A CONSUMER GROUP

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:55.284
WERE ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE THEIR

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:56.485
MONEY. BUT A LOT OF THESE

01:10:56.552 --> 01:10:57.786
DETAILS I DO THINK HAVE TO BE

01:10:57.853 --> 01:10:58.988
WORKED OUT AS WE GO FORWARD IN

01:10:59.054 --> 01:11:00.689
THE PROCESS BECAUSE THIS IS NOT

01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:01.824
A SIMPLE PROGRAM AND I KNOW

01:11:01.890 --> 01:11:03.525

TO THE CONSUMER AND THERE IS A

01:11:12.601 --> 01:11:15.304
SINGLE USE PLASTIC BILL THAT

01:11:15.371 --> 01:11:17.606
HOPEFULLY WILL BE COMPATIBLE

01:11:17.673 --> 01:11:19.808
WITH THIS BUT THERE'S OTHER

01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:21.610
REFORMS THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN

01:11:21.677 --> 01:11:22.911
WITH THIS BILL IS A MUCH AND

01:11:22.978 --> 01:11:25.481
MAYBE MORE CONSUMER BILL AS IT
