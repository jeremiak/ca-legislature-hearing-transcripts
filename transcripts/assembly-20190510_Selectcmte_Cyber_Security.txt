THANK YOU AND AND IF YOU COULD WELL HAVE EVERYBODY WE WOULD APPRECIATE. SO WE'LL SEE SO WELCOME TO CAL STATE CHANNEL ISLANDS HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE. OKAY GOOD SO THROUGH MIX WILL WORST WE'RE DELIGHTED THAT YOU'RE HERE -- WE ARE THE NEWEST AND THE FASTEST GROWING -- CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUS AND WE ARE HONORED TO ONCE AGAIN -- HOST THIS COMMITTEE MEETING AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO EXPRESS -- PARTICULAR NOTE OF APPRECIATION TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- WHEN I'M NOT JUST FOR HER EXEMPLARY LEADERSHIP ON BEHALF OF OUR COMMUNITY? ON AS A WHOLE AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO FOR HER GREAT SUPPORT FOR EXPANDING ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. ON IN SERVICE OF A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT. SHE ACTUALLY PLAYED A VITAL ROLE IN BRINGING OUR NEWEST DEGREE PROGRAM HERE TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MECHATRONICS ENGINEERING -- WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT WORK FORCE NEED AND WILL SERVE AS A WONDERFUL PATHWAY FOR SO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS. TO REALLY INCREDIBLE CAREERS. ON CYBERSECURITY IS IS A TOPIC THAT IS NEAR AND DEAR TO OUR HEART HERE AT CAL STATE CHANNEL ISLANDS ON THE CHAIR OF OUR COMPUTER SCIENCE PROGRAM DOCTOR MICHAEL PSALTIS HE COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY UNFORTUNATELY. BUT HE SITS ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- WINS ADVISORY. CYBERSECURITY ADVISORY BOARD HE ALSO SITS ON THE GOVERNOR CYBERSECURITY TASK FORCE AND THE SO CAL HIGH TECH TECHNOLOGY TASK FORCE HE IS IN ADDITION TO THAT A CYBER WARFARE FELLOW FOR THE OFFICE OF NAVAL RESEARCH. AND HE'S ESTABLISH LASTING RELATIONSHIPS HERE IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT REALLY BUILD TECHNOLOGICAL PROFICIENCY BUT ALSO PROFICIENCY AROUND THE ISSUES THAT YOU'LL BE DISCUSSING TODAY -- ONE GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS WORK IS SOMETHING CALLED -- SEEKERS SO OUR COMPUTER SCIENCE STUDENTS THEY PARTNERED WITH A LOCAL BRANCH OF THE FBI ON END OF INTER COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF ATTAINING. TIMELY FORENSIC EVIDENCE -- FROM COMPUTERS IN A WAY THAT PREVENTS EVIDENCE TAMPERING IS REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IN ONE MONTH A BILL SOMETHING CALLED SEEKER I'M IT'S A PROTOTYPE OF A DIGITAL FORENSIC CRIME PREVENTION TOOL THAT ALLOWS LAW ENFORCEMENT TO COLLECT EVIDENCE IN A MATTER OF SECONDS. I HAD THE GREAT PLEASURE OF WATCHING OUR STUDENTS UNVEILED THIS TECHNOLOGY SITTING NEXT TO FORMER VENTURA COUNTY SHERIFF JEFF DEAN AND HE ALMOST FELL OUT OF HIS CHAIR WHEN HE REALIZED HOW MUCH OF HIS OWN LIFE HE HAD SPENT. TRYING TO OBTAIN THIS KIND OF INFORMATION THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO SECURE IN A MATTER OF SECONDS. AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE MANY EXAMPLES OF WONDERFUL PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE COMMUNITY ALL AROUND ISSUES OF CYBER SECURITY SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE WISHING YOU A PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION -- AND THINK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO FOR CAL STATE CHANNEL ISLANDS WE APPRECIATE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DOCTOR BACK WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND WE DO APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR FACULTIES INVOLVEMENT ON OUR ADVISORY. COMMITTEE MEETING AND THOSE THE STUDENTS HERE ARE TRULY -- INCREDIBLE. AHS SO I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME ALL OF YOU TO OUR SELECT COMMITTEE ON CYBERSECURITY OF MOST OF THESE COMMITTEE MEETINGS ARE HELD IN SACRAMENTO AND WE END UP WITH WE HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF US. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THAT ARE ABLE -- TO JOIN US -- BUT SINCE WE ARE DOING THIS IN THE DISTRICTS BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME SPECIFIC DISTRICT ISSUES WE WANT -- TO DISCUSS WE ARE FILMING TODAY AND WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE TO SHARE THIS WITH THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE -- WE DO HAVE A OUTSIDE A NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING PANEL SO -- I'M REALLY EXCITED TO HEAR EVERYTHING THAT -- THEY HAVE TO SAY AND KNOW WHAT WE REALLY ARE FOCUSES ON ON SMALL BUSINESSES TODAY AND AND HOW THEY ARE ABLE TO HOW THEY CAN BETTER PROTECT THEMSELVES. CYBERSECURITY IT'S BEEN IN THE HEADLINES MORE MORE IN THE PAST FEW YEARS WITH LARGE SCALE BREACHES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION TOUCHING MANY OF OUR LIVES. AND MANY OF US INTRODUCING MORE CONNECTED DEVICES INTO OUR HOMES AND REPORT OF RUSSIAN HACKING INTERFERENCE IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN ELECTION. BUT CYBER SECURITY IS NOT A NEW ISSUE OF THE IMPORTANCE IT HAS BEEN A GROWING THREAT TO AS MORE OF US TO WHAT GOVERNMENTS DO AND MORE OF WHAT BUSINESSES DO DEPEND ON COMPUTERS. AND THE INTERNET TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY. OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS OF MY EFFORTS BOTH IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE UNITED STATES WITH THE NATIONAL CONFERENCE OF STATE LEGISLATURES. I'VE SEEN THAT OUR WORK AT THE STATE LEVEL TO DEFEND AND BECOME RESILIENT IS BEING CONSISTENTLY OUTPACED BY HACKERS. AND NATION STATES FINDING AND USING VULNERABILITIES TO UNDERMINE OUR SECURITY. WITH SO MUCH OF THE CONVERSATION BEING FOCUS ON HOW GOVERNMENTS AND LARGE BUSINESSES ARE BEING IMPACTED. I BECAME INCREASINGLY CONCERNED WITH SMALL BUSINESSES THE TRUE. ECONOMIC ENGINES OF OUR COMMUNITY. AS OUR FIRST PANEL WILL DIVE DEEPER INTO THE CYBER THREATS THAT ARE BEING EXPLOITED TODAY. THAT CYBER THREATS THAT ARE BEING EXPLOITED TODAY DO NOT DISCRIMINATE ON THE BUSINESS THE SIZE OF THE BUSINESS ON THEIR LOCATION OR WHAT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ARE BEING OFFERED. MANY OF THE THREATS ARE BASED ON VULNERABILITIES IN THE SOFTWARE THAT IS WIDELY USED BY BUSINESSES BOTH LARGE AND SMALL. THOSE SEEKING TO EXPLOIT THOSE VULNERABILITIES OFTEN DO NOT KNOW WHO OR WHAT THEIR HACKING UNTIL THEY ARE SUCCESSFUL. MANY OF THE HACKERS ARE USING AUTOMATED TOOLS LITERALLY COMBING THE OPEN INTERNET FOR UNPREPARED NETWORKS AND DEVICES. THE MORE PASSIVE HACKERS DECIDE WHETHER STEALING THE INFORMATION FOR IDENTITY THEFT OR HOLDING THE INFORMATION FOR RANSOM IS MORE LUCRATIVE OFTEN THEY DO BOTH. OTHERS USE THEIR ACCESS TO INSERT THEMSELVES INTO BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS DIVERTING FAT FUNDS OR SENDING A RONIN YES COMMANDS TO EMPLOYEES. THOSE OUTCOMES WHILE DISTRESSING FOR ANY BUSINESS ARE SPECIALLY HARMFUL FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND AND WE OFTEN HEAR THAT SMALL BUSINESSES. AFTER CLOSE AS A RESULT OF THE BIG BREACH. THE ABILITY TO PAY RANSOM WHICH IS STRONGLY DISCOURAGED BY NEW COMPUTERS OR DEVICES OR HIRE PROFESSIONAL RESPONSE TEAMS IS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE AND AS I SAID OFTEN RESULTS IN THE CLOSURE OF SMALL BUSINESSES. IT IS BECOMING CLEAR THAT THE BEST AND MOST ECONOMICAL ECONOMICAL PATH FORWARD FOR SMALL BUSINESSES TO SURVIVE A CYBER ATTACK IS TO BE PREPARED. AND PREVENT AS MANY AS POSSIBLE. AND HAVE AFFORDABLE CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT PREVENT. A REAL WORLD EXAMPLE OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN'S WISDOM AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS WORTH A POUND OF CURE. AND THAT'S WHY I DECIDED TO HOLD THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON CYBERSECURITY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND PROFESSIONALS. MY HOPE IS THAT THIS HEARING WILL HELP PUT THE SPOTLIGHT ON THE ISSUE FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND PROFESSIONALS IN CALIFORNIA TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE TARGETS. ARE SECOND AND THIRD PANELS WILL HELP US IDENTIFY NEXT STEPS TO EMPOWER SMALL BUSINESSES BY DISCUSSING BEST PRACTICES. IN ADDRESSING THE CYBER THREATS AND DISCOVERING HOW TO LEVERAGE EXISTING LINES OF COMMUNICATION WITHIN SMALL BUSINESSES AND PROFESSIONAL COMMUNITIES. TO SHARE THESE BEST PRACTICES OF ALL RIGHT SO WE ARE GOING TO GO TO OUR FIRST PANEL AND THE WRITING IS REALLY SMALL. OPENS RIGHT HERE SO I WOULD OF LIKE TO WELCOME UP. TONY WILL. WHO IS THE SENIOR DEPUTY WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE OF VENTURA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY? AND CHEMO HILL DRESS AN INVESTIGATOR WITH VENTURA COUNTY DA'S OFFICE. DETECTIVE ROBERT ARTHUR FROM THE VENTURA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE. AND DEBORAH CHIANG GREASY DEBORAH HERE -- YES AND DEBORAH IS THE VP OF BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND PUBLIC POLICY FOR HACKER. ONE OF SHE WAS UP IN SACRAMENTO THIS WEEK AND SHE HAS SOME VERY INTERESTING THINGS TO SAY A HACKER ONE IS A VULNERABILITY COORDINATION AND BUG BOUNTY PLATFORM. A THIS PANEL IS GOING TO SEEK TO GATHER INFORMATION ON THE CURRENT THREAD. A THREAT TRENDS THAT ARE TARGETING THE PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES WITH A FOCUS ON SMALL BUSINESSES. AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED -- TO HERE WITH ALL THE PEOPLE HAVE TO SAY SO WELCOME AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR TAKING PART IN. OUR SELECT. THANK YOU. I THINK WHERE TO START WITH TONY RIGHT OKAY GOOD MORNING -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU. TO PICTURE HYPOTHETICAL WHERE A BUSINESS TRANSACTION IS UNDER WAY [INAUDIBLE] AND A THE ONE PROFESSIONAL IS SEEKING TO PURCHASE ASSETS FROM ANOTHER PROFESSIONAL ON IT KEEP IN MIND THIS IS IN THE SMALL BUSINESS CONTEXT. SO IF THE PURCHASER YET OF A SELLER. SO THE PURCHASER HAS AN AGENT THAT WORKS IN THE PURCHASERS OFFICE AND THIS. TRANSACTION IS AN ESCROW. AND AS IT IS NEARING THE END OF THE ESCROW PROCESS. THE PURCHASER THE PURCHASING AGENT KNOWS THAT IT'S ALMOST TIME TO WIRE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY INTO THE SELLERS BANK ACCOUNT. SO THIS -- THIS PURCHASING AGENT IS AWARE THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT THREATS AROUND CYBERSECURITY -- THIS THIS IS PROFESSIONAL THIS AGENT HAS OBTAINED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TRANSACTION -- THE ACCOUNT NUMBERS THAT ARE NOT GOING TO BE USED TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WIRE TRANSFER OF SIGNIFICANT FUNDS FROM. HER EMPLOYER INTO THE SELLER'S ACCOUNT. SO AT THE TIME THAT THIS THESE FUNDS ARE DUE TO BE TRANSFERRED. UP SHE GOES TO EXECUTE THE TRANSACTION BUT IT'S NOT GOING THROUGH. SO SHE DOES WHAT SHE'S BEEN TRAINED TO DO SHOULD PICK UP THE PHONE AND SHE CALLS THE SELLER'S AGENT. AND SHE SAYS TO THE SELLER'S AGENT HEY I'M TRYING TO WIRE. YOUR ROUGHLY HALF A MILLION DOLLARS INTO THIS BANK ACCOUNT SO WE CAN COMPLETE THIS TRANSACTION AND CONCLUDE ESCROW. AND SO THE SELLER'S AGENT LOOKS AT THE WIRING INSTRUCTIONS THAT WERE PROVIDED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE TRANSACTION. AND REALIZES THAT THERE WAS A TYPO AND THAT ONE OF THE ACCOUNT ONE OF THE DIGITS OF THE ACCOUNT NUMBER IS WRONG. SO TELEPHONICALLY THIS A SELLER'S AGENT TELLS THE PURCHASERS AGENT. I'M GOING TO SEND YOU AN EMAIL WITH THE CORRECT ACCOUNT INSTRUCTIONS WITH THE CORRECT ACCOUNT NUMBER. AND THAT HAPPENS. AND SO THE CELL THE PURCHASERS AGENT OPENS UP HER EMAIL SPECIES OKAY HERE'S NEW WIRING INSTRUCTIONS WITH AN ACCOUNT NUMBER. HOWEVER WITHIN SECONDS OF RECEIVING THAT EMAIL. THE PURCHASERS AGENT RECEIVES A SECOND EMAIL SEC I'M SORRY I MADE A MISTAKE. DISREGARD THAT FIRST EMAIL USE THE ACCOUNT NUMBER IN THIS SECOND EMAIL. AND KEEP IN MIND THE PURCHASERS AGENT JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH THE SELLER'S AGENT. AND SO SHE SAYS OKAY MAKES SENSE AND SHE WIRES. JUST OVER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS OUT OF HER EMPLOYERS ACCOUNT INTO WHAT SHE BELIEVES TO BE THE SELLER'S ACCOUNT. OF COURSE. WE ALL KNOW HOW THE STORY ENDS. THAT WAS NOT THE LEGITIMATE ACCOUNT AND JUST OVER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS HAS JUST BEEN SENT SOMEWHERE INTO THE CYBER. YOU KNOW TO THE CYBER NETWORK. AND THOSE FUNDS ARE LARGELY COULD BE. UNOBTAINABLE THEY'RE NOT COMING BACK SO THE QUESTION THAT ALL OF US IN THIS ROOM WOULD BE ASKING AS WELL. HOW DID THE CROOK NOTICE SENT? THIS SECOND EMAIL SO QUICKLY IF THIS IS HOW DID THIS CROOKED THIS IMMACULATE TIMING. AND THE ANSWER IS REAL TIME SURVEILLANCE. THAT IS THE LEVEL OF SOPHISTICATION THAT WE'RE SEEING WITH CYBER CRIMINALS. THE IT'S BELIEVED THAT THE THAT THE CRIMINAL HAD INSTALLED MALWARE EITHER A TROJAN. OR SOME SORT OF REAL TIME SURVEILLANCE SOFTWARE TO ONE BE AWARE THAT THIS TRANSACTION WAS OCCURRING. TO TO KNOW ALL THAT FROM THIS THAT THIS FIRST EMAIL CAME IN AND ACTION NEED TO BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY. AND THE ONLY WAY THAT COULD BE WHICH IS REAL TIME SURVEILLANCE AND WHAT THIS AND UNFORTUNATELY OF COURSE THIS IS A REAL CASE AND THOSE FUNDS WERE TRANSFERRED OUT. AND WHAT IT REPRESENTS IS THE INCREASING AND ASTOUNDING -- SOPHISTICATION OF CYBER CRIMINALS. NOW. THAT IS TYPICALLY CALLED DESCAMPS CALLED BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE AND BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISES WHEN A YOU KNOW IS WHAT IT CRIMINAL HAS PENETRATED SOMEONE'S NETWORK -- TYPICALLY IT IS. IT'S OUR SOME SORT OF PROFESSIONAL THEY'RE AWARE THAT THEIR TRANSACTION IS TAKING PLACE THEY'RE AWARE THAT THEY NEED TO BE VERY VERY PERFECT ON THEIR TIMING. TO HAVE WIRES THAT HAD TO HAVE THE FUNDS WIRED TO THEM. THAT SORT OF COMPROMISE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN COST THE TAXPAYERS OF THIS STATE OVER FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. AND HALF OF THAT FLOWS FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE -- TARGETED A REAL ESTATE CONSUMERS JUST LIKE ME IN YOU NORMAL PEOPLE TRYING TO BUY PROPERTY. AND THEY LOSE THEIR MONEY TO LIFESAVING SEARCHES WIRED OUT -- THE ANOTHER CASE THAT WAS WORK BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE INVOLVED -- ANOTHER SCAMPER SIMILAR TO THE FIRST CAMP THAT I TALKED ABOUT -- BUT AFTER THE FUNDS WERE WIRED OUT -- KEEP THE INVESTIGATOR HILDRETH WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS CASE A LITTLE BIT MORE BUT THE FUNDS WERE WIRED OUT INTO THAT OUT OF STATE BANK ACCOUNT -- THE PERSON THAT RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS THEN CONVERTED THOSE FUNDS INTO A CASHIER'S CHECKS NOT ONE BUT TWO CASHIERS CHECKS THAT WERE THEN PLACED INTO STANDARD US MAIL ACTUALLY TAKE A BACK FED EX. AND THEN SENT TO TWO DIFFERENT DESTINATIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES. AND ONE THOSE -- PACKAGES ARRIVED AT THEIR DESTINATIONS THOSE DESTINATIONS WERE BIG POINT EXCHANGES. SO THE CRIMINAL WAS IN THE PROCESS LITERALLY UP TAKING. A CRIMINAL PROCEEDS THAT THEY HAD STOLEN FROM A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE CAM AND THEN WE'RE LOOKING TO LAUNDER THAT MONEY FROM U. S. CURRENCY INTER CRYPTOCURRENCY WHERE IT WOULD THEN ZERO DISAPPEAR INTO THE CRYPTO CURRENCY MARKETS. WHICH ARE NOT UNTRACEABLE BUT IT'S EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TO TRACE THAT MONEY ONCE IT MOVES INTO THE CRYPTO CURRENCY ROUND SO. THE AS AS YOU ARE AWARE OF THIS IS JUST COULD SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES -- WORLDWIDE IT'S BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS -- THERE IS NOT A FIRM TECHNOLOGY FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM -- OR I WORK IN THE REAL ESTATE FRAUD UNIT I WORK AND I JUST RETURNING GREG TITANS REAL ESTATE FRAUD UNIT -- WE ARE ONE OF THE FEW UP COUNTIES IN THE STATE THAT HAS A DEDICATED REAL ESTATE FRAUD UNIT AND WE ARE HERE TO INVESTIGATE AND PROSECUTE THESE TYPES OF CRIMES. AS PART OF MY MANDATE A TO SPREAD AWARENESS OF BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE SCAMS I TALKED TO A LOT OF REALTORS. AND WE TALKED TO REALTORS BECAUSE AS I SAID 50% OF BC SCAMS IN THIS STATE TARGET. CONSUMERS INVOLVED IN REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE THE MOST COMMON POINT OF PENETRATION THE BREACH FOR REAL ESTATE RELATED BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE SCAMS ARE WITH REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS. AGENTS BROKERS. AND THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE. THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE BECAUSE AS YOU ARE AWARE -- THE VAST MAJORITY OF REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OUR TEN NINETY NINE EMPLOYEES -- BROKERS AGENTS. AND THE PROBLEM WITH THAT THE TECHNOLOGICAL PROBLEMS AT THAT PRESENTS FOR TACKLING BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISES THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE CENTRALIZED IT SUPPORT. THERE'S NO CENTRALIZED. COMPUTER PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE LOCKING DOWN THEIR NETWORKS MAKING SURE THAT THE OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE PATCHED THAT THEY HAVE TO DO IS TO LATEST UP YOU KNOW MALWARE THAT THEIR FIREWALLS ARE PATCHED. THAT THEY ARE RUNNING THE MOST CURRENT BROWSERS WHATEVER THEY USE WHETHER IT'S INTERNET EXPLORER OR GOOGLE CHROME -- BECAUSE THAT'S HOW CRIMINALS OR EXT TAKING ADVANTAGE BEEN. PERFORMING THESE BREACHES IS BY GOING INTO ON PACKED SYSTEMS. SO IT CREATES A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE BECAUSE NOT ALL REAL ESTATE AGENTS ARE TECHNOLOGICALLY SAVVY. I WAS VERY STRUCK WHEN I GAVE A PRESENTATION A FEW MONTHS AGO AND KEEP IN MIND REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS COME FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE ALL BACKGROUND SUMMER TECHNOLOGY. A TECHNOLOGICALLY SAVVY MANY OR NOT. AND AN OLDER REAL ESTATE AGENT RAISED HER HAND SHE SAID HOW MY SUPPOSED -- TO MAKE SURE THAT MY OPERATING SYSTEMS UP TO STOP ON MY TABLET ON MY COMPUTER THAT I'M RUNNING UP YOU KNOW. TECHNOLOGY SECURITY SOFTWARE ON MY PHONE ONE I STILL HAVE TO CALL MY GRANDSON TO ASK HIM TO COME OVER TO MY HOUSE TO ADD. A NEW CONTACT TO MY PHONE. AND THAT REALLY UNDERSCORES THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM IS. CYBER THIEVES ARE EXTRAORDINARILY SOPHISTICATED AND THEY ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF AFFORDABLE POPULATION THAT IS TYPICALLY NOT TECHNOLOGICALLY SOPHISTICATED. THANK YOU THANK YOU. WHO ARE WE GOING TO HAVE? I CAN GO NEXT. I HOPE THAT THE RADIO. YES -- HI MY NAME'S CHEMO HILDRETH -- I'M A COP SO I NEED SOME PICTURES TONY'S OF VERY DEEP INTO THIS VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE -- I FOUND A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE ARE NOT AS AWARE OF BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE SO IF THIS IS OUR MEDIA ALIVE I APOLOGIZE BUT IT SEEMS TO BE HELPFUL -- QUICKLY ABOUT ME I START OUT OF MOLD STARTED RUNNING KING RIGHTS SHIRTS APARTMENT -- NINE ELEVEN HAPPENED I GOT A LOT OF INDUSTRY CERTS -- IN TECHNOLOGY -- TWENTY FIFTEEN I MOVED OUT HERE I NOW WORK FOR THE VENTURA COUNTY DA'S OFFICE AND I'M ON F. B. I. CYBER TASK FORCE. ALL THESE THINGS I TALK ABOUT ARE MY OWN OPINION NOT THAT OF THE U. S. GOVERNMENT OR JACQUI IRWIN OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY. SO BAD JOKES AROUND ME. AND GOOD ONES -- TONY GOT SPOKE ABOUT A COUPLE OF THESE -- LOCAL VICTIMS. I'LL JUST TOUCH ON IT MY DAD WAS BUYING HIS SON HIS FIRST BUSINESS WITH HIS LIFE SAVINGS -- AND HE GOT HIT BY ONE OF THESE BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE ESCROW WIRES THAT TONY MENTIONED AND EVERYTHING'S GONE. NO INSURANCE NOTHING COVERS THAT MONEY'S GONE. THIS ONE HAD A HAPPY ENDING THANKS THE DA'S OFFICE -- VERY GOOD PROSECUTOR WHO'S VERY CLOSE TO TONY HIS WIFE -- KAREN WALLED I WAS ABLE TO GET ALL THE MONEY BACK WELL MINE IS SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS. ANOTHER ONE A LOCAL BUSINESSES TRYING TO EXPAND SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR WIRE -- POOF SAME THING GONE. IT WASN'T SO LUCKY IN THAT CASE. SO WHAT ARE THE STATS LOOKING LIKE WILL LIKELY THE INTERNET CRIME CENTER -- JUST CAME OUT WITH THEIR TWENTY EIGHTEEN STATS A FEW DAYS AGO EVEN THOUGH WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH. TWENTY NINETEEN AND CALIFORNIA LEADS THE WAY WE'RE WINNING AND WE DON'T MEAN WINNING AS FAR AS LAW ENFORCEMENT WINNING. OR ANYTHING ELSE THE BAD GUYS ARE WINNING WE HAVE FORTY NINE THOUSAND PEOPLE FILED CYBER CRIMES -- TO THIS SITE SO PROBABLY TRIPLE THAT IT WAS BRIGHT CLOSE TO THE REAL NUMBER. CALIFORNIA'S ALSO WINNING IN OUR LOSSES FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS LAST YEAR. CYBER CRIMES. AND I PUT THIS NUMBER IN HERE JUST BECAUSE THE NEXT PERSON SPEAKS AND BE MY FRIEND A DEPUTY BOBBY ARTHUR'S IN PART TALK ABOUT MALL WHERE I JUST WANT TO SHOW YOU HOW PALTRY THAT AMOUNT IS COMPARED TO WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE SO. THE NUMBER ONE LEADS THE WAY SOMETHING MOST PEOPLE HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE WITH THE LOSS OF ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS REAL MONEY. AND IT'S ATTACKING SMALL MEDIUM SIZE BUSINESSES WHY BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY IS AND IT CAN BE DEVASTATING. THIS DATA -- MR WHEN REFERRED TO A MINUTE AGO 60% OF SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES THAT ARE HIT. ARE CLOSED WITH A MAJOR PREACHER CLOSE SIX MONTHS LATER. SO YOU CAN HAVE A FAMILY BUSINESS IN IN BUSINESS FOR GENERATIONS AND IT'S GONE. AND THIS IS NOT JUST TV THIS IS REAL WE HAVE PEOPLE CALLING THE FBI OFFICE IN TWO YEARS -- THEY'VE LOST THE GENERATIONAL BUSINESS OR THEY'VE LOST ALL THE MONEY THAT WAS GOING TO GO TO BUY A HOME. IT CETERA. THE REAL PROBLEM SO I'M GONNA TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISED IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM IT'S SOMEONE PRETENDING TO BE THE CEO AT YOUR COMPANY -- ROOM WRITING AN EMAIL AS IF THEY ARE THE CEO TO SOMEONE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE FOR LET'S SAY YOU KNOW TO BUY MILLION DOLLAR -- NEW OFFICE WELL THE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE PERSON WANTING TO GET THERE CHRISTMAS BONUS CHECK AND MAKE THE BOSS HAPPY WILL DO IT WITHOUT EVER TALKING TO THE BOSS JUST BASED ON AN EMAIL. NOW BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE A LOT OF TIMES ARE SUSPECTS ARE OVERSEAS AND WE CAN'T GET THEM OR IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THEM BUT WHAT IS LOCAL IS WHAT WE CALL THE MONEY BILL SOMEBODY HAS TO HAVE A REAL BUSINESS ACCOUNT A REAL BANKING ACCOUNT. THESE ARE MONEY MANY LAUNDERS WE CALL MONEY BILLS -- AND THE MONEY MEALS. A LOT OF TIMES THEMSELVES THIS GETS REALLY TRICKY AND I THINK TONY WENT OVER A LOT OF THIS BUT IT'S VERY CONFUSING SO I LIKE PICTURES SO BEAR WITH ME. SO A LOT OF TIMES THE PERSON WITH THE BANK ACCOUNT IS A VICTIM OF ROMANCE CAM THEMSELF. SO SOMEBODY LIKE THIS LADY AN ACTUAL VENTURE A PERSON OF COLOR JULIET CYBER JULIET IS DATING SOMEONE ONLINE FOR A COUPLE YEARS ME TO MY MATCH DOT COM AFTER HER HUSBAND DIED -- THERE THIS GUY'S TELLING HER EVERYTHING SHE WANTS TO HEAR SHE HAD A LITTLE FOOT SURGERY HE SENDS HER FLOWERS TEDDY BEARS. HE TALKS TO WERE SEVERAL TIMES A DAY MUCH BETTER THAN I AM WITH MY WIFE THAT'S MY JOKE BUT SADLY IT'S TRUE -- AND IN THE END -- ANYBODY WANT TO GUESS HOW MUCH MONEY THIS LADY WAS OUT IN A TWO YEAR RELATIONSHIP. THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. DOES ANYONE WANT TO GUESS -- HER LEVEL OF EDUCATION [INAUDIBLE] PHD. SO OF SOME OF THAT PHD. BEFORE I STARTED INVESTIGATING THIS I THOUGHT THESE PEOPLE WERE ALL SUCKERS THEY'RE NOT. THESE CRIMES ARE VERY -- INVOLVED -- AND WORST OF ALL SHE WASN'T TALKING TO THAT MAN SHE WAS TALKING TO MY SUSPECT IN CHICAGO. SO WHO KNOWS BETTER HOW TO TALK TO A LADY THAT ANOTHER WOMAN HIS MEN WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THAT REALM BUT REMEMBER IT'S MOTHER'S DAY ON SUNDAY. THAT WAS A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT FOR MEN AND SO HOW INTRICATE ARE THESE -- LÀ I GO GIVE YOU QUICKLY TO HELP UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS HOW THE BAD GUY -- MANIPULATES PEOPLE AND I I KEEP REFERRING TO THE VICTIM OF ROMANCE CAM AS A WOMAN -- THERE ARE A LOT OF MEN VICTIMS TOO BUT THEIR CRIMES ARE NOT NEARLY AS INTERESTING BECAUSE ALL THE WOMAN HAS TO DO IS SEND SOME TOPLESS PHOTOS AND THEY GOT HIM HOOK LINE AND SINKER. WHERE IS THE THE WOMEN WHO ARE THE VICTIMS HAVE TO BE -- WOULD A LITTLE MORE SO SO THEY'LL MEET HIM ON LIKE MATCH DOT COM THE VERY QUICKLY TELLEM. LET'S MOVE TO ANOTHER -- ANOTHER METHOD OF COMMUNICATION SOME SORT OF CHATTING -- AND THIS IS WHAT'S CALLED CAT FISHING YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD OF ITS TWENTY TWENTY SIXTY MINUTES -- AND THE BAD GUY WILL HAVE PICKED SOME GOOD LOOKING DUDES OFF. OFF THE INTERNET WHO POST A LOT THAT'S WHY A LOT OF TIMES THE PICTURES ARE MILITARY GUYS BECAUSE THEIR OVERSEAS AND THEY'RE SENDING VIDEO AND SO FORTH BACK TO THEIR FAMILIES BACK HOME. SO THEY JUST NEED A FOLDER OF THEIR GUY IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT POSES SO THEY CAN KEEP SENDING IT TO THE POOR VICTIM. AND THEN IF THE GUY THEIR LOVER OF THEIR CYBER ROMEO SUPPOSEDLY FROM HOUSTON TEXAS. THEY'LL CALL THE VICTIM FROM HOUSTON TEXAS PHONE NUMBER HOW DO THEY DO THAT THESE ARE FREE PHONES MOVING OUT I ALWAYS SAY IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT -- ASK YOUR TEENAGE CHILD. IT'S VERY EASY -- THEY'LL SET UP FAKE BANK WEB PAGES THIS IS A FAKE WHAT WEB PAGE OF CHARTER STANDARD CHARTERED BANK EVERYTHING LOOK REAL. SOMETIMES YOU CATCH SOME SPELLING ERRORS YOU CAN'T SEE IT THAT'S TOO SMALL THERE BUT AND THEY'LL HAVE THE VICTIM IN MY ONE CASE THE VICTIM WAS TOLD TO LOG INTO THE SUSPECTS WEB PAGE. SHE DID THE SUSPECT TRUSTED HER ENOUGH TO GIVE HER HIS USERNAME AND PASSWORD FOR THE WEB PAGE. THE WEBPAGE FAKE BY THE WAY RIGHT SO SHE LOGS IN AND SHE SEES ALL MY GOD NOT ONLY IS THIS GUY. THIS HOT BRAZILIAN SIX WITH TWO WASHBOARD ABS. BUT WHEN SHE LOGGED INTO HIS ACCOUNT HE HAS THREE MILLION POUNDS STERLING SITTING THERE. SO NOW THEY GOT THE VICTIM HOOK LINE AND SINKER BECAUSE SHE'S ALREADY IN LOVE. AND THERE'S THE GREED ELEMENT IT'S A IT'S A COMBINATION THAT CAN'T BE BROKEN -- I OFTEN TO ASK WELL HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU TALK TO THESE PEOPLE I MEAN ARE YOU THERE SAY WE'RE WE'RE LIVE CHATTING I SAID WELL WHEN YOU'RE TALKING TO HIM OUR THEIR MOUTHS MOVING OUR OUR HOW ARE THE BAD GUYS DOING IT WHY FOUND UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON. HAD PUT TOGETHER -- A SOFTWARE. ON OUR LEFT -- IT'S A PRESIDENT OF BROCCO BOMB ON THE VIEW THAT'S REAL ON OUR RIGHT IT'S UP PRESIDENT OBAMA -- WITH A BASICALLY A FAKE MOUTH AND THE BAD GUYS CAN. BE TALKING TO A VICTIM ONLINE AND HAVE THAT -- VIDEO GOING AND HIS MOUTH TO MOVE ACCORDING TO WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IN REAL TIME. SO THAT'S OUT HOW INTRICATE THEY'RE BECOMING HOMELESS I DON'T KNOW IF THIS'LL. YOU GOT AUDIO. WE HAVE ALREADY. WAS VERY GOOD -- WE HAD AUDIO WE TESTED WITH THIS IS HOW IT ALWAYS GOES -- THEY THEY'VE DONE IT FOR A BUNCH OF VARIOUS -- WORLD LEADERS JUST SAID TO THE AS A PROOF OF CONCEPT. BUT HIS MOUTH BASICALLY WE CAN SEE FROM LEFT AND RIGHT HIS MOUTH IS MOVING THE SAME IN BOTH AND IT'S EASY TO TRICK SOMEBODY WITH THIS. I GOT A COUPLE MORE IDEAS IF YOU CAN. HE PUT THE OLD ONE BACK IN -- SO THAT'S WHAT ONE EMAIL THE OTHER STYLE. THE OTHER ONE IS -- WORK AT HOME -- MONEY BILLS A LOT OF COLLEGE STUDENTS GET HIT WITH THESE -- BECAUSE THEY TRY TO MAKE A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY AND THEY'LL STILL FILL OUT A JOB APPLICATION THEY'LL DO A BACKGROUND CHECK SURPRISINGLY THEY'LL PASS. A LOT OF PEOPLE LEISURE VILLAGE GET THIS ONE TO TRYING ON A FIXED INCOME TRYING TO MAKE SOME EXTRA MONEY AND ALL THEY'RE DOING IS RECEIVING MONEY AND AND WIRING IT OUT SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THERE JUST. LAUNDERING STOLEN MONEY BUT THEY HAVE NO IDEA THEY THINK THEY'RE DOING A LEGITIMATE BUSINESS. AND SO I EXPLAIN BOTH OF THOSE TO COME TO THIS SLIDE. I HAD ONE WORK AT HOME -- VICTIM IN HAWAII SENT THREE HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO A ROMANCE CAM VICTIM IN CAMARILLO CALIFORNIA WHO WAS TOLD BY HER CYBER BOYFRIEND TO WIRED TO THREE DIFFERENT PLACES IN WISCONSIN. SO HOW DO WE GET THAT MONEY BACK THIS IS WHERE WE NEED SOME FIXES BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE PUTTING TOOTHPASTE BACK IN A TWO THE MONEY'S ALL OVER THE PLACE IT'S CASH. AND IT MOVES FAST. AND THIS IS ONLY GOING UP THIS IS A TREND MICRO'S THAT I FOUND -- SUPPOSED TO HIT NINE BILLION IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN FBI STATS I READ SAID IT HIT TWELVE BILLION -- THEY'RE HITTING MAJOR. THE MAJOR COMPANIES ONE UBIQUITY UP IN THE BAY AREA GOT HIT IN ONE OF THESE FOR FORTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. OTHER HITTING UNIVERSITIES THE HEADING OUR INVESTMENTS -- THEY'RE GOING AFTER THE COURT SYSTEMS -- I HAVE A REAL ESTATE ABOUT FIVE MINUTE LONG VIDEO WHICH I GUESS GIVEN JUST TALK ALL THE ANSWERS IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF AUDIO WE HAVE AUDIO LET'S SEE -- OKAY. THIS DESCRIBES REAL STAY BCI USE REALISTIC IS THAT AFFECTS ALL OF US BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE HOMES BY HOME SELL HOMES IS FANTASTIC VIDEO [INAUDIBLE] THE YOU HEAR. I HAVEN'T SEEN -- MESSAGE. I'M NOT SURE COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND. HE'S GONE ALL OF IT EVERYTHING WE WORK HARDER. FOR THIS IS A TWO THOUSAND TO JUST DISAPPEAR. THERE MUST BE SOME KIND OF THE STATE THERE'S NO MISTAKE. WHO -- I REALLY STAGE LAWLER. MY HOLES AND HE HAS FOR COMPANIES. TO TIMES WHEN FROM ON THE SENATE RACE TASK FORCE. THE ESCROW COMPANY RUNNING AND TO SEE THAT AND I NEED TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION FROM THE ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING WE CAN DO. FOR STARTERS. I GOT AN EMAIL REQUESTING TO CHANGE THE WIRING INSTRUCTIONS FROM YOUR YEAH I GOT. ONE OF THESE AGO FROM A REAL ESTATE AGENT. THIS IS THE BEST NUMBER YEAH. AND I HAVE. THEY CAN DO THAT. ACTUALLY SEND AN EMAIL FROM HIS ACCOUNT IT'S A FOUR STEP PROCESS THAT I CAN WALK YOU THROUGH IT. IT IS NUMBER ONE THEY REFUSE SOMETHING CALLED AN EMAIL EXTRACTOR SOFTWARE YOU CAN BUY ON THE INTERNET. THAT ENABLES THEM TO COLLECT EMAIL ADDRESSES FOR THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WORKING IN A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY. IN THIS CASE THE REAL. ESTATE. AGENTS BROKERS ESCROW OFFICER. ANYBODY WITH THE REAL ESTATE RELATED EXTENSION. STEP. INVOLVES THE HACKERS IN A FIFTEEN HOUR TWO THOUSAND ADDRESSES THEY JUST HARVESTED. ARE. THE PEOPLE THAT THE ONLY NUMBER CLICKING ON A LINK OR OPENING AND AND SO WE NEED. TO TAKE THEIR NAMES. THAT SOUNDS THREE RESEARCH -- LISTING ADDRESSES SALES PRICES TO ROMANCE S. TITLE COMPANY NAMES EVEN. SOPHISTICATED AND THEN THAT SO [INAUDIBLE] NINE NINE QUESTION JUST CENTER. OR WONDER FIRMS TO A DIFFERENT ACCOUNT. IN. MUST BE TREATED AS SUSPICIOUS AND MUST BE FOLLOWED UP WITH A PHONE CALL TO VERIFY IT'S AUTHENTICITY. NINE COURTESY TO CONTACT YOUR LENDER. RECALL. IT'S A LONG SHOT SIX SEVEN DAYS. IT'S WORKING. WELL IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE WE SHOULD BE DOING [INAUDIBLE] IMMEDIATELY -- THROUGH BECAUSE IT SUMS UP A VERY DIFFICULT -- THING TO UNDERSTAND EASILY SO BASICALLY IT'S A TONY'S SPOKE OF A LOT OF SOME WAYS THEY GET OUR INFORMATION BUT THERE'S MANY WAYS -- THE BAD GUYS LET'S SAY WANT TO TARGET -- BUSINESSES HE CAN BY ONE POINT THREE MILLION FOR EIGHTY FOUR DOLLARS AS LEADS IN THIS IS NOT DARK WEB STUFF THIS IS YOU KNOW LEGITIMATE HE CAN BUY LEADS AND THAT'S HIS LIST OF PEOPLE TO SEND FISHING EMAILS -- TO YOU CAN PICK ALL THE REALTORS AND LA ORANGE COUNTY FOR ELEVEN BUCKS YOU GET TEN THOUSAND OF THEM SOMEONE'S GOING TO BE FISH SUCCESSFULLY AND THEN THE BAG I CAN -- BY ONE OF THESE KIDS TWENTY FIVE BUCKS IF YOU WANT -- YOU KNOW HELP TECH SUPPORT IS FORTY FIVE DOLLARS AND IT HAS ALL THE STUFF YOU NEED -- TO DO THE FISHING -- TO GATHER THE INFORMATION TO VICTIMIZE PEOPLE. AND THEN HE SENDS OUT A EMAIL LIKE THIS WHICH OF FISHING EMAIL WHERE THE A REALTOR WILL ENTER THEIR EMAIL AND PASSWORD OR THE ESCROW PERSON WHOEVER -- AND AND HOW MANY PEOPLE BOUGHT A HOUSE AND USE DOCUSIGN. AND YOU SEE THAT LITTLE THUMBNAIL BUT YOU CAN'T QUITE SEE RIGHT SO THEN YOU SO THIS IS -- AND ANOTHER ONE WE SEEN WHERE THEN YOU CLICK ON THE THUMBNAIL THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE A DOCUSIGN AND THEY WANT YOU TO SIGN IN. HERE AND THEN THEY HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE SPELLING SO. THEY DON'T GET THE SPELLING RIGHT AND IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO THIS EMAIL THIS -- U. R. L. NOT TO DOCUSIGN. AND THEN YOU GET THIS VERY REALISTIC LOOKING SIGN IN YOU ENTER YOUR CREDENTIALS. NOW THE STOLEN IT BUT TO THROW YOU OFF THAT YOU JUST MEN -- HACKED OF THE THROAT THE STOCKY SIGN WARNING SAYING -- OUR SITE ARE YOU KNOW WE TRY AGAIN SO THAT WE THINK -- SOME JUST WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM AND IF YOU NOTICE THE OVEN SPELLED WRONG WRONG THERE -- NOW THE BAG I HAS YOUR STUFF HE LOGS IN AS YOU HE READS YOUR INFORMATION AT WORK FOR MONTHS UNTIL HE KNOWS HOW YOUR OFFICE RUNS. AND THEN WHEN THIS NICE FAMILIES ABOUT TO BUY A HOUSE -- HE CHANGES THE WIRE INSTRUCTIONS LIKE WE SPOKE OF EARLIER AND THEN YOU END UP WANTING IT TO ONE OF THOSE MONEY MEALS -- HERE'S A REAL ONE FROM SANTA THERESA I CHANGE THE NAMES AND SO FORTH BUT I'M I LEFT THAT IN THERE SO YOU POINT OUT TO THE AYE. THE A LOT OF TIMES THE I WILL NOT BE CAPITALIZE THAT THE DEAD -- DEAD GIVEAWAY ALSO IF YOU SEE THE WORD KINDLY USED A LOT -- IT'S PROBABLY FRAUDULENT THIS GUY DIDN'T REALIZE HE'D WIRED THE MONEY THE WRONG PLACE WE MET IN PERSON WITH HIS ESCROW OFFICER AT FOUR FORTY FIVE INDEED WIRED THE MONEY EARLIER THAT MORNING. AND THE ESCROW OFFICER SAID -- WE DON'T USE BE OF A WE USE WELLS FARGO AND THEN THAT WAS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE. AND NOW THE BAG I HAS THE MONEY AND WE HEAR THESE ALL THE TIME PEOPLE LOSING THEIR LIFE SAVINGS IT'S VERY SAD [INAUDIBLE] ONLINE. ALL THE NEEDS OF THAT. IS MONEY [INAUDIBLE] EIGHTY SO THIS IS SO COMMON WE HAVE. YOU KNOW CARTOONS ABOUT IT BUT SO WE HAVE TO START TAKING IT SERIOUSLY AND DOING SOMETHING IS SOCIETY BECAUSE IT IS GOING TO BANKRUPT US. AND THE EASIEST THING FOR ALL YOU TO TELL YOUR FAMILIES -- IF YOU'RE DOING A REAL ESTATE THE BEST WAY TO MITIGATE THIS IS WHAT WE CALL TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION -- BUT THE THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE DONE ON THE ESCROW PERSON SIDE. BUT WHAT YOUR FAMILY CAN DO IS WHAT I CALL TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION WHICH IS BASICALLY MAKE THE PHONE CALL WHEN YOU GET CHANGED WIRE INSTRUCTIONS RIGHT BEFORE CLOSE OF ESCROW CALL AND DON'T CALL THE PHONE NUMBER IN THE EMAIL. CALL THE PHONE NUMBER YOU KNEW FROM THE BEGINNING AND SAY DO YOU GUYS JUST CHANGE BANKS AFTER BEING WITH B. OF A FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS. FOR MY TRANSACTION WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH WELLS FARGO AND THEY'LL SAY NO WE DIDN'T. NOW YOU SAVE YOUR LIFE SAVINGS -- THERE IS INSURANCE THAT PROTECTS AGAINST THIS BUT GENERALLY CYBER INSURANCE IS EXPENSIVE FOR BUSINESSES AND IT DOES NOT GUARD AGAINST THIS KIND OF LOS BECAUSE THIS IS CONSIDERED SOCIAL ENGINEERING. SOCIAL ENGINEERING INSURANCE IS AVAILABLE IT'S EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE IT'S LIKE BUYING EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE SO. BE CAREFUL LIKE A TONY AND JACKIE SAID IT'S PREVENTION IS THE KEY. AND THAT'S IT THANK YOU ANY GRANDKIDS. FULL TO QUESTION OKAY AFTER SINCE WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE. BEHIND THANK YOU CAME OUT. RIGHT FOR ME YES RIGHT. TO THE SEA. IT SHOULD BE ON THE DESKTOP. GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY I MÀ ROBERT ARTHUR. I'M A DETECTIVE WITH THE VENTURA COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE I CURRENTLY WORK -- IN CYBER CRIME INVESTIGATIONS WITH CHEMO AND I WAS ASKED TO COME TO TALK ABOUT -- SOME ADDITIONAL THREATS RIGHT NOW TO THE COMMUNITY TO SMALL BUSINESSES SO IT'S GOING. TO KIND OF PIGGY BACK A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT TONY TALK ABOUT CHEMO TALK ABOUT -- WE'RE GONNA DIVE A LITTLE DEEPER AND A FEW OTHER -- SCHOOL THREATS. SO NOW WE'RE TYSON RANSOMWARE -- YOU MAY HAVE HEARD RANSOMWARE MELBOURNE TASTE MIGHT BE A NEW TERM FOR YOU WILL TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT IS AND THE IDEA BEHIND THESE IS YOUR DATA IS A HOT CAN BE HOSTAGE IT'S GOING TO BE. HELD FOR RANSOM -- AND YOU CAN HAVE TO PAY TO GET THAT BACK OR HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE OTHER SECURITY MEASURES IN PLACE AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE ISSUES COMING UP WITH THIS. SO TEST YOUR STUPIDITY RIGHT THE PROBLEM IS A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU TALK TO THEM ABOUT THESE TYPES OF SCAMS OR YOU KNOW. A RANSOM WHERE THEY GO I'M NOT STUPID ENOUGH TO FALL FOR THAT -- BUT AS CHEMO TALK ABOUT IN IN TWENTY TALK ABOUT WE'RE NOT DEALING FOR THE MOST PART WHICH IS SOME LOW LEVEL -- CRIMINALS RETIREMENT PEOPLE THEY'RE VERY SOPHISTICATED THEY GO TO THE LONG -- THEY TAKE STEPS TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE CRIMES ARE WELL POLISHED AND IT'S VERY EASY TO FALL FOR THESE A MINISTRY SOME EXAMPLES A LITTLE BIT HERE -- AND IT'S VERY EASY FOR JUST ABOUT ANYONE THE COMMUNITY OR BUSINESS TO FALL FOR SOME THE SCAMS IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS TO SPOT SOME OF THESE. THIS IS A SCREEN RIGHT HERE IN IF ANYONE SEEN SCRIPT POP UP ON YOUR COMPUTER ISRAEL BECAUSE IT POPPED UP ON MY COMPUTER AT WORK. SO. WITH LITERALLY ALL FIND I THINK -- WHAT ABOUT COME TO CHECK ON THE WEATHER IN THIS LAST RAINY SEASON AND ALSO AND I GET GOOGLE CHROME CREDIBLE OR THAT? UP. THAT'S INTERESTING OUR ESKIMO TALK ABOUT IT MAY BE A LITTLE HARD TO READ BUT I'M GONNA READ A COUPLE THESE LINES THE VERY FIRST LINE UP THERE. THERE WAS A DANGER IS TRY TO GET AN ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL LOG INS -- ANOTHER ONE HERE THERE IS A GREAT THREAT OF LEAKING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA. I DON'T THE GOOGLE IS GOING TO PUT OUT A NOTICE LIKE THAT OBVIOUSLY RIGHT AWAY I RECOGNIZE THIS IN A LOT OF YOU'LL BE ALL YEAH THAT'S THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A SCAM -- THIS IS WHAT WOULD BE KNOWN AS SCREEN WHERE IT'S A POP UP THAT COMES UP ON YOUR SCREEN AND THE IDEA IS TO SCARE PEOPLE THE IDEA IS TO PUT SOME FEAR. ON TO SOMEBODY THAT ALL MY GOSH SOMETHING REALLY IS WRONG WITH MY COMPUTER -- BUT BEING THAT THEY GOT A HOLD OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS INVESTIGATE CYBER CRIME I THOUGHT I'M GONNA PLAY ALONG SO THERE'S A WHOLE ONE EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER. ONE TOLL FREE NUMBER SO I CALLED -- THESE NEXT FEW SLIDES ARE GONNA GO IS ACTUALLY CONVERSATION I HAD WITH THIS PERSON -- IT IS VERY QUITE SAID RECORDED ON MY PHONE SO WE'LL SEE HOW THE IDEA COMES OUT OF IT DOESN'T COME OUT WELL ALL TO GET THROUGH AND TELL YOU HOW IT WENT. I WANT YOU IF YOU CAN HEAR TO PAY ATTENTION TO MY CONVERSATION WITH THIS THIS LADY -- SHE HAS A THICK ACCENT BUT SHE'S. AGAIN WELL POLISHED SHE'S GOT ANSWERS SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT SHE'S LEADING ME THROUGH MY COMPUTER ON WHERE TO ENTER CERTAIN INFORMATION. ULTIMATELY SHE'S TRYING TO GET ME TO LOG INTO A SERVER. OUT OF THE COUNTRY THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW REMOTE ACCESS FOR HER ONCE THEY HAVE REMOTE ACCESS MY COMPUTER THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT THEY CAN LOCK DOWN MY FILES THEY CAN START -- ADDING VIRUSES MALWARE TO MY SYSTEM I HAVE EVEN GO THAT FAR WITH IT BUT YOU'LL SEE I PLEAD STUPID WITH IT WENT ALONG JUST TO SEE WHAT SHE WOULD DO SO WE'LL SEE IF THIS PLACE TO PAY ATTENTION TO HOW -- HOW SHE IS IN AT THE BEGINNING I'LL TELL YA I? IT WAS LONG CONVERSATIONS I JUST USE CLIPS FROM IT FOR THIS SLIDE BUT SHE DID TELL ME THE BEGINNING I KEPT ASKING HOW MUCH IS GOING TO COST ME AND SHE GETS THAT ALL IT WITH A HUNDRED DOLLARS. SO. WE'LL SEE IF THIS GOES THROUGH YEAH [INAUDIBLE] JOHN. FIRST OF ALL -- WHAT WHAT -- ESTABLISH SUPPORT CONNECTION OKAY. GOOD FIX MY COMPUTER. I'M TALKING A MICROSOFT -- COOL. SHE'S IN FRESNO CALIFORNIA SHE TELLS ME. FOR A YEAR BOB. THEY PAY REALLY WELL. IF YOU'RE VERY SMART -- SEE SHE'S. SHE'S OKAY SHE'S NICE AND SMOOTH POLITE. THAT ARE JUST ARE NOT TO TRUST ME [INAUDIBLE] LATER. SHE STARTS TO FALTER NOW WHAT WHAT [INAUDIBLE] SURE. SO I SEIZE TELL BY THE AND SHE STARTS TO REALIZE THAT I AM START TO QUESTION A LITTLE BIT NOW ALSO IN HER POLISH SCRIPT ISN'T SELLING SO GOOD YOU NOT WHAT SURE WHAT TO SAY. WHEN SHE FIRST TOLD ME OH YEAH THE SERVERS AND FRESNO CALIFORNIA KINDA LAUGHED MYSELF YEAH RIGHT WELL THEN I LOOKED IT UP? SURE ENOUGH APPARENTLY THERE IS A SERVER IN FRESNO CALIFORNIA FOR MICROSOFT SO THAT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU THESE PEOPLE ARE DOING THE RESEARCH -- SHE THAT'S PROBABLY A QUESTION SHE GETS VERY OFTEN I WILL OUT AT ONE POINT SHE DID ASK ME HOW OLD I WAS AND I LIGHT A TOURIST FIFTY YEARS OLD SHOES ALL YOU'RE VERY YOUNG. SO FIFTY IS YOUNG FIRST OFF AND APPARENTLY THE CLIENTELE SHE USUALLY GETS IS OBVIOUSLY MUCH OLDER THAN THAT THEY TARGET ON ELDERLY BECAUSE THEY KNOW. THAT THEIR THE CHEMO SAID THE BRAIN NOT GONNA BE AS TECH SAVVY SO -- THIS WAS A DIFFERENT SITUATION FOR HER. SO LET'S TALK ABOUT A COUPLE THESE ARE NOW OVER TIES INTO RANSOMWARE VÀ MELTER TIES IS BASICALLY MALICIOUS ADVERTISING ONLINE -- HOW MANY GO TO WEBSITES AND YOU'RE JUST BOMBARDED WITH BANNERS AND ADVERTISING WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW THINGS YOU LOOKED UP BEFORE AND THEN IT'S TRACKING -- YOUR INTERESTS EITHER WAY SO MANY WEBSITES ARE NOW USING ADVERTISING FOR INCOME. BUT A LOT OF BAD GUYS ARE NOW REALIZING THEY CAN USE THAT ADVERTISING TO INJECT MALICIOUS -- NOW WHERE IN THERE AND IF YOU CLICK ON IT YOU'RE GONNA START THAT. AS WELL AS SOME OF THESE -- WEBSITES THIS THIS MALWARE CAN ACTUALLY START TO INFECT YOUR COMPUTER EVEN WITHOUT BEING CLICKING ON IT -- THERE'S DIFFERENT SITUATIONS WHERE OBVIOUSLY IF YOU HAVE ADDS THAT MOTION EVERYTHING GOING YOU HAVE LIKE A DEAL BE FLASH RUNNING THERE WAS A BIG -- BRIE -- HOLES IN THE ADOBE FLASH PROGRAM A COUPLE YEARS AGO THE NEED TO BE PATCHED. AS YOU CAN SEE UP THERE THERE'S A FEW VERY POPULAR WEBSITES NEW YORK AND THEN B. C. YOUTUBE SPOTIFY REALTOR DOT COM NOT SAYING DON'T GO THESE WEBSITES. BUT THEY WERE KNOWN TO HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF MALVERN TIES IN. INSIDE THEIR ADS -- AGAIN I'M NOT SAYING DON'T GO TO THESE AS LONG AS YOU HAVE GOOD SECURITY MEASURES YOU KNOW ANTI VIRUS AND YOU'RE NOT CLICKING AND YOU HAVE GOOD ONLINE HYGIENE. YOU'RE PROBABLY OKAY RANSOMWARE RANSOMWARE THE MORE COMMON TERMS AROUND SINCE THE EIGHTIES AND THAT'S THE IDEA THAT YOUR DATA THROUGH MALWARE CAN NOW BE LOCKED DOWN BY THE BAD GUYS IN THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA GET THAT DOWN. GET THAT BACK. IS THROUGH. TRYING TO PAY THEM THEY'RE GOING TO ASK FOR MONEY AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEE YOU'RE GETTING THAT -- THAT INFORMATION BACK THESE -- MALWARE CAN BE STARTED THROUGH PHISHING EMAILS THROUGH THE MAIL FOR TIGHTENING DOWNLOADS WEBSITES -- IT IS A STILL A VERY BIG PROBLEM I KNOW CHEMO SHOWED HIS STATS I THINK YOU MIGHT ASK YOU DOES I CAN'T PROVE THAT YET BUT I'M WORKING ON IT. SO FOR SOME OF THE POP WE GIVE TALK ABOUT HOW -- YEAH I'M NOT STUPID TO FALL FOR THAT KIND OF STUFF BUT YOU KNOW THEY THEY THERE MIGHT BE MISS SOME SPELL WORDS IN HERE BY THE USE A LOT OF THE BOWLS LÀ THE SEALS ARE DIFFERENT AGENCY SO YOU'VE GOT OBVIOUSLY THE FBI SEAL DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THIS WILL BE ANOTHER -- YOU KNOW EITHER A SCREEN LOCKER SCREEN SCREEN WHERE THAT'S BASICALLY SAYING HEY YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT ILLEGAL STUFF ONLINE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY MONEY IT USUALLY GIVE YOU INSTRUCTIONS TO GIVE YOU A TIME LIMIT -- THIS IS MORE OF A RANSOMWARE SITUATION WHERE THE COMPUTER HAS BEEN LOCKED DOWN OR FILES HAVE BEEN LOCKED DOWN IN THIS WOULD POP UP ON YOUR COMPUTER AS YOU CAN SEE IT SAYS IT'S BEEN ENCRYPTED -- IT GIVES A NICE COUNTDOWN FOR YOU IT'S A YOU COMPLAIN BIT COIN AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A MINUTE HERE -- VERY WELL PUT TOGETHER AND OBVIOUSLY GONNA SCARE A LOT OF PEOPLE. A COMMON BLUESCREEN YOU MIGHT SEE ON WINDOWS COMPUTERS WILL THIS ONE WAS CREATED AGAIN BY A SOME HACKERS THAT BASICALLY TRYING TO SCARE PEOPLE SAY YOU GOT A BIG PROBLEM IN YOUR COMPUTER BUT HEY HERE'S A TOLL FREE NUMBER WE WOULD LOVE TO HELP YOU OUT WITH THIS AND IT'S VERY. SIMILAR TO THE PERSON I CALLED ARE GONNA BE THE SAME IDEA -- HERE'S A NICE WELL PUT TOGETHER YOU'VE GOT THREE DIFFERENT AGENCIES LOGOS AT THE TOP THERE TO MAKE IT LOOK VERY OFFICIAL CONSTRUCTIONS. EVEN AS A VERY NICE LITTLE TO TORY ON THE RIGHT SEEN OKAY YOU HAVE TO PAY AS TO GET YOUR FILES BACK STEP. ONE GO TO WALMART OR KMART. WITH YOUR MONEY STEP TO BUY A MONEY PACK STEP THREE COME BACK IN YOU ENTER THE CODE FROM THE BACK OF THE MONEY PACK RIGHT HERE IT'S ALL SPELLED OUT NICE. AND SIMPLE FOR YOU. NOW THIS ONE SAYS YOU NEED TO PAY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS ONE IS USING MONEY PACKED THE LAST ONE WAS USING THAT POINT BUT THE IDEA IS THE SAME. THEY'VE LOCKED DOWN YOUR FILES AND THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA GET BACK SOME OF THESE FILES IS BY PAIN US. NOW WHEN IT COMES TO SMALL BUSINESSES WRITTEN LARGE BUSINESSES YOU KNOW YOUR FILES MAY BE EVERYTHING TO YOU WHETHER IT'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR WHETHER IT'S YOUR YOU KNOW. FAMILY PHOTOS AT HOME. THIS REALLY SCARES A LOT OF PEOPLE IN IT SHOULD. OUR THIS IS A VERY CALM ON THE CAME OUT TO SEE A A SPECIAL AGENT AGAIN THEY'RE SAYING WE HAVE -- YOUR COMPUTER'S FILES ARE LOCKED DOWN THIS ONE IS FUNNY BECAUSE IN THE MIDDLE IT BASICALLY SAYS BUT AN EARLY BIRD SPECIAL ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS IF YOU PAY NOW BUT IF YOU WAIT. IT'S GOING TO GO TO TWO FIFTY AND THEN AFTER THAT IT'S FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS SO -- THESE GUYS ARE ENTREPRENEURS TO WRITE THEY KNOW. PEOPLE ARE GONNA JUMP AT THAT LOWER NUMBER PROBABLY QUICKLY IT RATHER THAN WAITING. ANOTHER BIG POINT. THIS IS AN INTERESTING SLIDE THIS WAS BASICALLY LIKE A LIVE MAP THAT WAS CREATED WHEN ONE OF THOSE -- BAD NOW WHERE RELEASES WENT THROUGH -- THERE WAS -- I TALK ABOUT LIKE ADOBE FLASH HAD A LOT OF HOLES IN THEIR THEIR SOFTWARE AND THEY WERE NOT PATCH SO THIS WAS A LIVE MAP THAT WAS CREATED SHOWING. THE SPREAD OF MALWARE THROUGH UNPATCHED SYSTEMS AS YOU LOT -- EASTERN EUROPE -- IN ASIA AREA JUST AN INTERESTING. VISUAL HOW FAST THESE CAN SPREAD. SO WE TALK ABOUT HAVING TO PAY THESE BAD GUYS -- DO YOU PAY YOUR DO NOT PAY IT IS OBVIOUSLY A RECOMMENDATION LÀ FORTY YOU DO NOT PAY BECAUSE THIS JUST ENCOURAGES THE BEHAVIOR THIS ENCOURAGES -- THE FACT THEY STILL HAVE A MARKET TO DO THAT BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO A LOT OF BUSINESSES DO -- AND A LOT DOESN'T GET REPORTED -- CHEMO SHOULD SOME STATS UP THERE THAT'S JUST WHAT WAS REPORTED WHAT WE KNOW OF OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF THIS IS PR IN SOME COMPANIES DON'T WANT TO HAVE NEGATIVE PUBLICITY SO -- WE DON'T EVEN KNOW OF ALL THE ONES THAT HAVE HAPPENED. SO A COUPLE THOSE WAYS TO PAY THEY SAID HEY GO TO WALMART GET A MONEY PACK. THESE ARE ALL KEY WORDS ARE KEY TERMS THAT SHOULD BE -- KNOWN ESPECIALLY FOR THE COMMUNITY VIEW HERE MONEY GRAMM WESTERN UNION PREPAID MONEY PACK GREEN DOT EVEN ITUNES WE HAD A CASE HERE LOCALLY WITH A POOR LADY -- SENIOR CITIZEN OF GOT MOST POP UPS CALLED HAVE A COMPUTER FIXED ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS LEADER IN ITUNES GIFT CARDS -- WE HAD HER COMPUTER AND WERE. FINDING ALL THESE ITUNES GIFT CARDS OR STAND IN AND BASICALLY THE BAD GUY SO. YOU TOOK A PROBABLY ABOUT A HUNDRED OR A FIVE DOLLAR COMPUTER THE BECAME A THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLAR COMPUTER BECAUSE SHE CONSTANTLY WAS PAYING TO HAVE IT FIXED AGAIN. JUST FALLING VICTIM NOT UNDERSTANDING HOW IT WORKS VERY SAD STORY. ARE AND WHY THESE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COMMON AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BE COMING BECAUSE HOW SIMPLE AS THIS. YOU TELL SOMEBODY OKAY GO TO WALMART BRING YOUR CASH BY THIS. ARE YOU MAY -- PRE -- LOADED CARD WITH YOUR MONEY COME BACK IN ON ALL THE BACK OF THESE ALL THESE CARDS THERE'S GOING TO BE A STE A KEY ON THE BACK OR EIGHT DIGIT -- OF LETTERS AND NUMBERS AND THAT BASICALLY GRANTS ACCESS TO THAT CARD SO ONCE YOU GIVE THAT NUMBER UP THE BAG A THEN CAN ACCESS ALL THE FUNDS IN THOSE CARDS. VERY SIMPLE AS OPPOSED TO TELLING SOMEONE OKAY GO GET A CRYPTOCURRENCY WALLET -- THE LOAD BIG COIN GO THROUGH AN EXCHANGE. THAT IS OUT THERE WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT THIS IS STILL THE SIMPLEST FORM THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE BECAUSE IT IS EASY. WHAT ARE WE SEEING MORE AND MORE THESE DAYS [INAUDIBLE] CRYPTO CURRENCIES. THEY'RE ALL AROUND THE WORLD. THEY'RE USED EVERYWHERE -- BIG COIN IS ON THERE IS WILD LOT OF THE OTHER TYPES A BIT -- CRYPTO CURRENCIES. THEY'RE POPPING OUT BIG COIN IS THE BIG ONE STILL EVERYONE'S BY HEARD A BIT COIN WHAT IS BIG CUENTA WHAT IS NOT A A TALK ABOUT WHAT THE QUEEN IS BUT IT'S BASICALLY [INAUDIBLE] COMPUTER COAT. THAT NICE -- BIT COIN RIGHT THERE THAT IS YOU SOMEONE'S ARTISTIC RENDITION OF IT. IF YOU RECEIVE BIG COINS RUSHING MADE. HAS NO VALUE BESIDES HOW COOL YOU THINK MIGHT BE BIG COIN IS LITERALLY COMPUTER CODE. AND IT'S GOTTEN NO PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES TO IT. WHY DO A LOT OF THESE HACKERS LIKE? CRYPTO CURRENCIES LIKE BIT COIN BY THE WAY THERE'S THERE'S HUNDREDS NOT AND THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT CRYPTO CURRENCIES AGAIN BIT COIN IS THE LARGEST IN THE MOST POPULAR. BUT THERE ARE MANY OUT THERE. THE IDEA BEHIND IT IS. THEIR DECENTRALIZED WHAT IS DECENTRALIZED MEANING THERE'S NO BANK THAT. SEES THESE THERE'S NO GOVERNMENT THAT OVERSEES THESE YOU CAN REMAIN ANONYMOUS ON IT THE IDEA IS IT IS ESTABLISHED ON A PLATFORM OF COMPUTERS. KNOWS ON AND ON THE NETWORK. WE'LL TRACK ALL THE TRANSACTIONS ALL THE ACTIVITIES AND IMPROVE THE APPROVED THE DIFFERENT TRANSACTIONS OF CRYPTO CURRENCIES IT IS NOT IN ANY GOVERNMENT IT'S NOT ONE BANK IT IS SPREAD OUT EVERYWHERE THERE IS NO ONE EIGHT HUNDRED BIT COIN THERE IS NO SUPPORT FOR BIT COIN. IT IS JUST A PROGRAM. AND THAT'S WHY THESE HACKERS AND THESE YOU KNOW DARK WHAT PEOPLE LIKE IT'S BECAUSE THEY CAN REMAIN ANONYMOUS AND THEY'RE NOT UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE BANK OR GOVERNMENT. OUR C. PRICE THINK OKAY YOU KNOW THIS STUFF HAPPEN I'VE HEARD ABOUT IT BUT YOU KNOW THIS IS HOLLYWOOD STUFF WELL IT REALLY IS HOLLYWOOD STUFF BECAUSE HERE SOME HEADLINES HOLLYWOOD HOSPITAL TO PAY SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN BITCOIN. TO HACKERS. MANY BIG CITIES AND EVEN SMALL CITIES HAVE FALLEN VICTIM TO RANSOMWARE BALTIMORE ATLANTA TALLAHASSEE JUST A FEW TO NAME WERE RANSOMWARE HIT THEM THEIR SERVICES WERE SHUT DOWN. THERE -- THEIR FILES WERE LOCKED DOWN A REALLY SLOW -- SHUT DOWN OPERATIONS FOR THE CITIES. FED EX WAS A HIT REALLY HARD WITH ONE THESE BIG -- CYBER ATTACKS THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS LOST. THIS IS AN ENTRY ARTICLE I JUST CAME ACROSS ACTUALLY PREPARING FOR THIS -- THEY PULLED A BUNCH OF SMALL BEATEN AND MEDIUM BUSINESS EXECUTIVES AND OWNERS AND ASK HEY WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO PAY A RANSOM WHERE IF YOU WERE. LOCKED OUT YOUR YOU KNOW DATA AND THE MAJORITY SAID ABSOLUTE YES I WOULD AND THAT IS WHY THESE CRIMINALS STILL HAVE A MARKET BECAUSE THEY KNOW HOW VALUABLE DATA IS. I JUST A FEW STEPS TO GO TO THESE ARE A LITTLE OLDER BUT IN THE BEGINNING A TWO THOUSAND NINE THE FIRST QUARTER ALMOST. ABOUT TWO AND A NINE MILLION DOLLARS OR HE PAID. TO RANT SOMEONE EXPECTED A BILLION DOLLARS. BY THE END OF THE YEAR. OUR 72% OF COMPANIES THAT WERE AFFECTED BY RANSOMWARE COULD NOT ACCESS THE DATA FOR A FEW DAYS AND ABOUT A THIRD COULDN'T EVEN GET IT FOR ABOUT A WEEK. A FEW MORE STAFF AS YOU CAN SEE THESE THINGS ARE NOT SLOWING DOWN THERE INCREASING -- THE NUMBER BUSINESSES TACKED. YOU KNOW IS IT IS GETTING MORE PREVALENT. THIS IS AN ISSUES THAT I THINK IT'S VERY CONSERVATIVE BUT ONE IN FIVE SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES WHO PAID A RANSOM. NEVER GOT THEIR DATA BACK I THINK IT'S MORE LIKE 50% -- THAT'S A PRETTY CONSERVATIVE NUMBERS EVEN IF YOU DO PAY THAT RANSOM THERE'S NO GUARANTEE YOU'RE GET YOUR DATA BACK WHY WOULD THESE CRIMINALS. CARE THEY'VE GOT WHAT THEY WANT THEY'RE GONNA MOVE ON MOBILE RANSOMWARE IS A NEW TREND AS WELL RIGHT EVERYONE'S GOT PHONES EVERYONE IS DOING MOST OF THEIR BUSINESS WHETHER IT'S PERSONAL OR BUSINESS RELATED FROM THEIR PHONE SO. WHAT DO YOU KNOW THE CYBER CRIMINALS THEY KNOW THAT THEY KNOW WHERE THAT THE DAD ANY INFORMATION IS SO THEY ARE FOCUSING ON PHONES TABLETS MOBILE DEVICES NOW? THEY CAN INJECT RANSOMWARE OR EVEN THOSE SCREEN WHERE SCARE TACTICS LIKE I TALKED ABOUT THESE CAN BE SET UP ON PHONES AS WELL. NOW WE'VE JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT NOW FOR TIES IN. AND RANSOMWARE I'M NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER SCHEME TO HEAR ABOUT ALL THE TIME RIGHT SOCIAL ENGINEERING WHERE THESE PEOPLE ARE DOING THEIR BACKGROUND CHECKS THERE KNOWING WHO THEY'RE TARGETING. WE TALK ABOUT LIKE THE WINDOWS A MEDIC YOU KNOW PHONE CALLS YOU CAN GET I MEAN ABOUT PHONE CALL SAYING HEY YOUR COMPUTER IS NOT WORKING. I HAVE A GOOD FRIEND WHO JUST TOLD ME RECENTLY I GET PHONE CALLS ALL THE TIME I TELL PEOPLE I DON'T EVEN OWN A COMPUTER. AND THEY JUST MOVE ON TO THE NEXT PERSON BECAUSE THEY KNOW PLENTY PEOPLE DO. ARE YOUR GRANDSON'S BEEN ARRESTED NEEDS MONEY LOTTERY SCAMS LIKE JERIAN SCANS OF ROMANCE CAM SCHEMA TALK ABOUT IRIS SCANS. ARE GAS PUMP SKIMMERS KEY LOGGERS YOU KNOW THESE ARE ALL STILL THREATS THAT WE ARE SEEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT WILL AFFECT NOT ONLY. THE COMMUNITY BUT BUSINESSES AS WELL. AGAIN I TALK ABOUT BUZZ WORDS TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR WESTERN UNION MONEY GRAM BIT COIN GREEN DOT ITUNES. IF YOU SEE THESE WORDS POP UP NO LEGITIMATE COMPANY ONE ASKING AND ASKING FOR MONEY UP FRONT LET ALONE IN THESE TYPES OF FORMS. SO WHERE IS ALL THIS HEADING THIS IS A CURRENT STAT -- FROM THE IC THREE THE FBI STAT -- IN -- COMPLAINT CENTER AS YOU CAN SEE BETWEEN 200-014-2000 EIGHT IN THE TOTAL LOSS AND FROM CYBER RELATED CRIMES WHAT FROM ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION. TO TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION FOUR YEARS. OBVIOUSLY THE COMPLAINTS HAVE GONE UP NOT AT THE SAME PACE WHICH I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING SO EITHER THAT MEANS THAT. EACH CRIME IS SEEN A BETTER REWARD FOR THESE CRIMINALS OR THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ARE JUST BASICALLY NOT REPORTING FOR THE FACTS WE TALKED ABOUT. IT'S P. BAD PR FOR THE BUSINESS IT'S EMBARRASSING ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT WAYS -- SO THAT'S A LOT OF THROUGHOUT YOUR REALLY QUICK BUT FROM A LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE. THESE ARE VERY COMMON ONLY INCREASING -- AND IT'S PUTTING A GREAT WORKLOAD ON US. THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI. MY NAME IS DEBBIE CHIANG I'M FROM A COMPANY CALLED HACKER. ONE WHICH IS IN SAN FRANCISCO AT THE SUBJECT OF THIS DISCUSSION AND THE TALK IS GOING TO BE -- SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER. THREE HACKER ONE IS FOCUSED ON DIGITAL VULNERABILITIES -- IT AND ITS MISSION IS TO PROTECT THE INTERNET I STILL LIKELY NOT THINGS THAT YOU WILL SEE AND FRIEND -- IN FRONT OF YOU EVERY DAY AS A CONSUMER BUT DEFINITELY AFFECTS YOU. AT THE OTHER -- WAY THAT THIS GUY CONVERSATION IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT IS THAT WHEN I SAY HACKERS I AM TALKING ABOUT THE GOOD ACTORS -- THE WHITE HAT HACKERS -- INDEPENDENT SECURITY RESEARCHERS ETHICAL SECURITY RESEARCHERS INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY RESEARCHERS -- THOSE ARE ALL NAMES. THAT ARE USED TO DESCRIBE WHAT WE CALL AND HACKER WHEN HACKERS SO AND MAKE THAT IMPORTANT DIFFERENTIATION FROM -- HACKERS WHICH I WILL CALL BAD ACTORS IN THIS CASE [INAUDIBLE] ZERO HACKER ONE IS THE WORLD'S LEADING PROVIDER OF HACKER POWERED SECURITY. HACKER ONE OPERATES A BUG BOUNTY PROGRAMS THAT CONNECT COMPANIES AND GOVERNMENTS WITH THE BEST WHITE HAT HACKERS IN THE WORLD TO FIND AND FIX VULNERABILITIES BEFORE MALICIOUS ACTORS EXPLOIT THEM. AS OF MAY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE HAVE OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND WHITE HAT HACKERS WHICH HAVE REGISTERED WITH HACKER. ONE TO DEFEND THE CUSTOMERS THAT WE HAVE AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT INCLUDING THE YOU THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. REMOVING OVER CLOSE TO ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND VULNERABILITIES BEFORE THE BAD GUYS DO AND PREVENTING AN UNTOLD NUMBER OF BREACHES IN THE PROCESS. TODAY CYBERSECURITY PRACTICES ARE SEVERELY OUTDATED IN CONTRAST TO THE CYBER THREATS THAT SOCIETY FACES. WHEN EXPLOITED FOR CRIMINAL PURPOSES EVEN JUST ONE SINGLE AND RELATIVELY AND REMARKABLE SECURITY VULNERABILITY CAN CREATE HAVOC AS THE EQUIFAX DATA BREACH GROSSLY REMINDED US OF IN? TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MANY OTHER PREACHERS HAVE MADE THE PRESS INCLUDING THE WANNA CRY RANSOMWARE ATTACK. I'M AND I THINK A PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID THAT DID THESE ATTACKS. DETRIMENTALLY IMPACT SMALL MEDIUM BUSINESSES BECAUSE 60% OF THE SMALL MEDIUM BUSINESSES GO OUT OF BUSINESS SIX MONTHS. AFTER A DATA BREACH OR SPUR SECURITY INCIDENT SO WE'RE PROUD TO HAVE -- AT MANY SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES AS PART OF OUR PORTFOLIO OF CUSTOMERS. SO NOW ONTO HACKER POWERED SECURITY AND WHAT EXACTLY IT IS IT IS WHAT WE THINK IS A SCALABLE MODEL THAT CAN BE USED TO PREVENT CYBER ATTACKS IN SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. ESPECIALLY FOR ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES WHO MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE EXPENSIVE CONSULTANTS AND PENETRATION TAX. AKA POWERED SECURITY COVERS ANY CYBERSECURITY ENHANCING SERVICES AND AUTOMATION'S THAT ARE PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY PRODUCED BY INDEPENDENTLY OPERATING SECURITY EXPERTS OUTSIDE THE COMPANY OR ORGANIZATION IN QUESTION. IT IS A MODEL THAT INVITES EXTERNAL AND INDEPENDENT SECURITY RESEARCHERS AND ETHICAL HACKERS TO HUNT FOR VULNERABILITIES AND COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS. THESE ARE INDIVIDUAL EXPERTS WHO HAVE SIGNED UP TO HELP CORPORATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS TO DETECT AND FIX THEIR SECURITY THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL FUNCTION OF HACKER POWERED SECURITY IS A VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE PROGRAM ALSO CALLED RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE COORDINATED PHONE ABILITY DISCLOSURE. OF HONOR ABILITY TO SOCIAL PROGRAM IS ESSENTIALLY A NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH FOR SOFTWARE. THE MOTTO IS IF YOU SEE SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING. CONCRETELY IF AND WHEN AN ETHICAL HACKER FINDS A SECURITY VULNERABILITY AND A COMPANY OR GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS WEBSITE OR MOBILE APP. OR OTHER COMPUTER SYSTEM -- THIS PERCENT WILL BE INVITED TO DISCLOSE THE VULNERABILITY FOUND TO THE SYSTEMS OWNER. YOU CAN BE SURE THAT THE BAD ACTORS ARE CONSTANTLY HACKING ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING SO WHY NOT LEVERAGE THE POWER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH TO GET THOSE. VULNERABILITIES BEFORE THE BAD GUYS. TO MOST HUMAN BEINGS ARE READY TO HELP THEIR NEIGHBORS OF THE IMPETUS FOR VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE IS ENORMOUS. SO I ENCOURAGE YOU ALL HERE IF YOU SEE A BUG. IN A OUT WEBSITE OR IN IT HE COMMERCE WEBSITE THAT YOU USE. I HAD TO REPORT IT TO THE COMPANY THAT YOU SEE IT. AS THAT YOU FOUND IT BECAUSE THAT IS LIKELY A BUG THAT A BAD ACTOR WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ISSUES OF LEGALITY AND TRUST HOWEVER MAKE PHONE ABILITY DISCLOSURE MORE COMPLICATED THAN A REGULAR NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE LEADING COMPANIES. HAVE CREATED THEIR OWN POLICY FRAMEWORKS FOR THE DISCLOSURE OF VULNERABILITIES TO THEM AND OTHERS TURN TO COMPANIES SUCH AS HACKER ONE TO ORGANIZE AND COORDINATE SUCH PROGRAMS. WHEN ANTI DID IT ENTITY DECIDES TO OFFER FINANCIAL REWARDS TO FINDERS OF VULNERABILITIES THE VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE PROGRAM IT'S CALLED A BUG BOUNTY PROGRAM? YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THESE IN THE PRESS -- BUG BOUNTY PROGRAMS HAVE EXISTED AT LEAST SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE THE PRACTICE WAS PERFECTED BY GOOGLE FACEBOOK AND MICROSOFT OVER THE PAST HALF DOZEN YEARS. HACKER POWERED SECURITY PROGRAMS HAVE DEBT DEMONSTRATED THEIR EFFECTIVENESS COMPARED TO OTHER METHODS OF ON ABILITY TO DETECTION. HAVE HIRING FULL TIME EMPLOYEES OR EXTERNAL SERVICE OUR PRODUCT VENDORS TO TEST FOR VULNERABILITIES IS MORE EXPENSIVE EXPENSIVE ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM BUSINESSES. NO OTHER METHOD FOR VALIDATING SOFTWARE OR MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS THERE THAT ARE IN USE BY CONSUMERS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO PRODUCE SIMILAR RESULTS. AT SUCH A FAVORABLE ECONOMIC UNIT PRICE. THE QUESTION I GET A LOT IS WHO ARE THESE HACKERS. SECURITY EXPERTS MAY BE DESCRIBED USING A VARIETY OF TITLES INCLUDING ETHICAL HACKER WHITE HAD SECURITY RESEARCHER BOB HUNTER AND FINDER. ONE TITLE IS CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT CRIMINAL. HACKERS ARE NOT CRIMINALS SPECIFICALLY BY BODY PLATFORMS OFFER NO BENEFIT TO SOMEONE WITH CRIMINAL INTENT. ON THE CONTRARY HACKER ONE WILL BE CAUGHT WE WILL RECORD DATA. ABOUT EVERY HACKER ON THE PLATFORM AND ONLY REWARD ACTIONS THAT FOLLOW THE RULES. FOR THESE REASONS CRIMINALS GO ELSEWHERE. HACKERS ARE DRIVEN A VARIETY OF MOTIVATIONS MANY OF WHICH ARE ALTRUISTIC. THE SECURITY ADVOCATES ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION I AM THE CALVARY SUMMARIZES THESE MOTIVE IS THE MOTIVATIONS AS PROTECT. MAKE THE WORLD A SAFER PLACE PUZZLE TINKER OUT OF CURIOSITY PRESTIGE SEEK PRIDE AND NOTABILITY. PROFIT TO EARN MONEY. AND AND PATRIOTISM IDEOLOGICAL AND PRINCIPLED. A TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN STUDY BY THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE. FOUND THAT ONLY 15% OF SECURITY RESEARCHERS EXPECT FINANCIAL COMPENSATION IN RESPONSE TO AVAILABILITY DISCLOSURE. AND NOW I WANT TO THE TYPES OF BUGS THAT OUR GUYS FIND. SO THESE ARE THE TYPES OF VULNERABILITIES -- THAT OUR MOST POPULAR -- POPULARLY FOUND ON OUR A BUYER HACKERS. XSS WHICH IS CROSS SITE SCRIPTING THAT'S THE ABILITY TO RUN CHAVIS JAVA SCRIPT CODE IN A VICTIMS WEB BROWSER -- SO IF YOU HAVE AN EXERCISE BIKE AND G. EMAIL -- THE HAT. A BAD ACTOR OR CRIMINAL CAN DO WHAT YOU WOULD AT WHAT YOU ORDINARILY WOULD DO WHICH IS SENDING READ EMAILS. OF FROM YOUR ACCOUNT. 38% OF OUR HACKERS LIKE SEARCHING FOR THIS ONE SO THIS IS THE MOST COMMON BUT THAT WE FIND FOR CUSTOMERS. SIEGEL INJECTION THE ABILITY TO CONTROL DATABASE QUERIES PASSWORDS ENCRYPTED PASSWORDS AND FINANCIAL DATA. THIS IS SECOND PLACE THIRTEEN POINT 5% OF OUR HACKERS FIND THESE KINDS OF BUGS BEFORE THE BAD GUYS DO. ARE THE MOST COMMON TYPE IN ONE PARTICULAR SEGMENT WHICH IS A FINANCIAL SERVICES AND FAN TACK -- WHICH MADE A COVER SOME OF THE REAL STATES AT BROKERAGE FORM AT FIRMS. IS THAT IS THAT IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION I'M SO AN EXAMPLE OF IMPROPER AUTHENTICATION ISN'T I DOOR ATTACK IT ALLOWS YOU TO SEE ANOTHER PERSON'S RECEIPT -- AND SEE OTHER PEOPLE'S DATA -- BY ACCIDENT BECAUSE THE CODE WASN'T DIDN'T ACCOMMODATE FOR THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION. ANOTHER COMMON BUG IS S. S. R. F. ACCESS TO INTERNAL NETWORK. IF SOMETHING IS HOSTED ON A CLOUD HACKERS COULDN'T ACT COULD GET AN ACCESS KEY TO AUTHENTICATION FOR THOSE INSTANCES. ACCESS INTERNAL TOOLS OF EMPLOYEES AND NOT INSIDERS ACCESS CLOUD INSTANCES AND BASICALLY STEAL DATA. WHY DO THESE BIKES HAPPEN? WE BELIEVE THAT BIKES HAPPEN BECAUSE ENGINEERS -- AREN'T REALLY THINKING OF USER INPUT -- AT THE TIME THAT THEY'RE WRITING THE CODE -- THEIR STRESS FOR RELEASES AND PRESSURE FOR GROWTH SECURITY TENDS TO BE A DEFAULT -- IF THERE'S NO Q. AND A TEAM OR SECURITY TEAM THE RELEASE APPS OR TOOLS BUGS WITH THEM. I AM HOWEVER YOU GUYS COMPANIES CAN LEVERAGE THE POWER OF THE ETHICAL HACKING COMMUNITY TO FIND THESE BIKES BEFORE BAD ACTORS DO. ARE HACKERS ALSO FIND ABOUT HALF OF THE BIKE THAT WE FIND OUR MEDIUM SEVERITY AND 15% ARE CONSIDERED CRITICAL -- SO AGAIN AS PART OF A SMALL MEDIUM BUSINESSES STRATEGY WHO CAN'T NECESSARILY AFFORD TO SECURITY ENGINEERS -- CONSULTANTS -- I'D SUGGEST TURNING TO AT THE HACKING COMMUNITY BY FIRST HAVING OF VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICY. JUST AT A MINIMUM MINIMUM SECURITY AT ADDRESS SO IF YOUR FELLOW NEIGHBOR FINDS A BUG OR YOUR CUSTOMER FINDS A BUG THEY HAVE A WAY TO TELL YOU BEFORE A BAD ACTOR EXPLOITS IT. AND THEN MOVE ON TO HAVING AVAILABILITY DISCLOSURE POLICY. WHICH HAS A COUPLE OF KEY COMPONENTS AND IT'S SPELLED OUT THE RULES OF WHAT IS ALLOWED AND WHAT ISN'T ALLOWED. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY A SAFE HARBOR FOR A COMMUNICATOR OF A BUG. THAT WAY YOU CAN LEVERAGE THE FREE HELP THAT THE SECURITY RESEARCHER COMMUNITY WILL GIVE YOU. I'M AND THEN MOST IMPORTANTLY BE SURE THAT YOU CAN IN TAKE THE BUGS AND FIX THEM. I'M A LOT OF THESE BUGS -- PARTICULARLY IN RANSOMWARE THEY'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF BECAUSE PATCHES WERE NEVER INSTALLED. SO IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO INTAKE THE BUG AND A PLAN TO REMEDIATE THEM. THAT'S WHAT ENCOURAGES AND IS THE MOTIVATION FOR A LOT OF THESE HACKERS TO DO WHAT THEY DO. SO INCLUDE TO CLOSE I REPEAT THE WORD OF NUMEROUS EXPERTS THAT A UBIQUITOUS SEE SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING PRACTICE FOR VULNERABILITIES IS A VITAL AND CRITICAL STEP TOWARDS IMPROVING CYBERSECURITY. FOR CONSUMERS. HACKER POWERED SECURITY HAS MATURED AS A MODEL TO BE READY TO HELP SOCIETY SOLVE ONE OF ITS MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS SABBATH THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND AND REALLY AND EXCELLENCE -- PANEL OF APPRECIATE YOU ALL JOINING US HERE AND WHAT I THINK WE'RE GONNA DO IS BECAUSE WE ARE. SEEM TO BE RUNNING A LITTLE SHORT ON TIME -- WE'RE GOING TO DO QUESTIONS AFTER OR MAYBE IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM IF YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BUT THANK YOU AND CAN WE GIVE A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE TO THIS. A AND THEN I WOULD LIKE TO BRING UP OUR SECOND PANEL WE WE DO HAVE THREE PANELS TOTAL AND I'M ENCOURAGING ALL PANELISTS. TO OF BE A LITTLE WARY OF THE TIME -- SO WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE HEAR EVERYBODY AND SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE TO EDUCATE AND ENCOURAGE ADOPTIONS OF CYBER SECURITY BEST PRACTICES IN CALIFORNIA. AND OUR SECOND PANEL THIS MORNING SEEKS TO GATHER INFORMATION ON THE CURRENT WAYS IN WHICH WE COMMUNICATE ABOUT CYBERSECURITY. AND MORE GENERALLY ABOUT BEST BUSINESS PRACTICES TO HELP LEVERAGE EXISTING LINES OF COMMUNICATION TO EXPAND -- KNOWLEDGE WITH US HERE TODAY -- WE HAVE A KNOWLEDGEABLE PANEL FROM REAL ESTATE SECTOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND THE CYBERSECURITY COMMUNITY. OF I WOULD LIKE -- TO WELCOME JIM KEITH WHO WILL BE SPEAKING FIRST HIS WITH THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE VENTURA COUNTY -- COASTAL ASSOCIATION ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WE ALSO HAVE CHECK LACK FROM DILBERT REAL ESTATE. NANCY HOLE THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE OXNARD CHAMBER AND THEN FINALLY WE WILL HAVE THIS ACTUAL OR WHO IS THE FOUNDER AND CEO OF AN NGO -- THAT WAS THE VIDEO THAT WE SOFT -- EARLIER ON THE VERY COOL VIDEO SO WHAT WE START WITH GEN. I BELIEVE JOKES CYNICAL FIRST OF TRUCK. WELL IF YOU'D LIKE. OKAY RIGHT WELCOME AND THANK YOU FOR ALL OF US PLANNING. HI I'M CHUCK BLACK ON THE BROKER FOR DEAL BUT REALTORS WE HAVE ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AGENTS -- ACROSS NORTHERN LOS ANGELES TWO OFFICES AND HER ACCOUNT -- WE HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH WIRE TO PROBLEMS THAT WERE MAJOR THAT I THEY RESULTED IN SOME SIGNIFICANT SIX FIGURE LOSSES FOR SOME CLIENTS. AND IN TALKING TO OTHER BROKERS FOR THEIR THEIR COMPANIES THIS IS OBVIOUSLY NOT SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY WANTS. TO TALK ABOUT AND SAY OKAY WE HAD THESE HUGE PROBLEM. OF MOST EVERYBODY HAS HAD THESE KINDS OF PROBLEMS. THIS PART -- ONE NOT HAPPEN TO BE WERE -- THE GENTLEMAN WAS IN ESCROW FOR A PROPERTY THAT WAS A LITTLE OVER A MILLION DOLLARS. HE WAS ASKED -- TO BEND IN HIS MONEY HE HAD A YUP -- ABOUT A HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF CASH THAT HE HAD TO SEND TO ESCROW. SO HE SAID THAT -- JUST PRIOR TO ESCROW CLOSING THE ESCROW OFFICER CALLED HIM ON THE PHONE SAID OKAY WE'RE ABOUT TO CLOSE IN A COUPLE OF DAYS WE NEED TO SEND YOUR MONEY. AND HE SAID WELL I ALREADY DID. AND SHE WAS THIS. PERSON STRUCK FOR A SECOND SHIFT AS WELL. WHAT I THINK WE GOT A PROBLEM AND I'VE NEVER CONTACT YOU TO SEND YOUR MONEY? SO SHE SENT THE THE THE F. B. I. A QUICK CALL THE FBI -- CALLED US TO TALK TO US ABOUT IT THIS WAS A LITTLE WHILE AGO SO. THEY DON'T ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS THEY ASKED US WAS DO YOU HAVE TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION -- FIRST THING WE DID WAS GOOGLE IT TO FIND OUT WHAT IT WAS AT THAT TIME. OF THE IT'S IT'S GOTTEN A LOT MORE POPULAR NOW BUT IT WAS DESCRIBED ALREADY THAT THIS IS WE HAVE SIX HUNDRED AGENTS AND THEY ARE ALL INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THEY HAVE EMAILS FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE. BY THE WAY WE ALSO HAD TO HAVE AN ESCROW COMPANY AND THAT ESCROW BENICIA ENDED UP -- ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO OF BEING SHOT DOWN AS FAR AS OUR COMPUTERS WERE CONCERNED WILL PLANTS MORE. THEY HAD A BACKUP. THEY WENT TO THAT BACK UP AND THEN THEY HAD TO WORK THROUGH THE PERIOD OF TIME FROM THAT BACK UP TO CURRENT. IT TOOK THEM TWO WEEKS TO GET THAT DONE. EVERYBODY WORKING OFF A LOT OF OVERTIME AND WE BUT THEY HAVE HIT US A COUPLE OF TIMES. TO THERE'S JUST THE STABBER TORSION THAT WE'VE END UP HAVING -- HOW DO THEY GET IN -- I HAPPEN TO BE LUCKY TO HAVE A BREAKFAST YESTERDAY WITH TO MY GRANDCHILDREN OR JUST CAME BACK FROM COLLEGE. FOR SUMMER VACATION ONCE FROM PURDUE THE OTHERS FROM GEORGIA TECH -- BOTH REALLY GOOD SCHOOLS AT HOME I WAS GOING TO BE SPEAKING THIS MORNING ABOUT THIS AND I ASKED HIM DID DO YOU HAVE THIS. MAYES ARE ALL YEAH YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DO THAT. WHEN WE SIGN IN AND MY GRANDSON SO WHEN I. SIGN IN TO GET A HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT IN A CLASS? I PLAN IN OF THE COMPUTER BUT THEN I HAVE TO GO TO MY PHONE AND YOU KNOW TYPING YES THIS WAS ME. AND ANY KIND OF THOUGHT FOR A SECOND USES WHY WOULD ANYBODY REALLY CARE ABOUT WHAT MY HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT WAS. AND IS THE PHONE YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S JUST BECAUSE THAT'S JUST A WAY TO GET IN A BACK DOOR WAY TO KIND OF LOOK AROUND AND SEE WHAT THEY HAVE -- WE STRIVE TO LOCK UP ARE IN INFORMATION BUT OTHERS SCRIBE REALLY TO TO TRY TO STEAL IT -- THERE ARE TWO SAFEGUARDS ONE IS ELECTRONIC THE OTHER ONE IS HUMAN IT'S US. WE OFTEN TRY TO PROTECT THIS INFORMATION USING PROGRAMS BUT FRANKLY ANY PROGRAM LIKE ANY LOCK CAN ALWAYS BE BEATEN -- I HAPPEN TO HAVE A PROFESSIONAL IT CONSULTANT THAT ALSO WORKS AS AN AGENT IN MY OFFICE. HER HUSBAND IS ALSO AN IT PROFESSIONAL SO I THOUGHT WELL LET ME LET ME CHECK WITH HER TO SEE WHAT THEY DO. USE IT TO PEOPLE WHAT DO YOU DO AT HOME. SO I ASKED WHAT PROGRAM THEY USE THAT SHE'S MY KIND OF SHEEPISHLY AND THEN SHE SAID WE DON'T USE A PROGRAM. AND I SIMPLE. MET DANGEROUS AND THIS IS WHERE TO SAFE GOING ON PROGRAM. THE OTHER ONE IS. ALWAYS HAVE TO CHANGE HE'S. PROGRAM LIKE IT BLOCKS NO SENATE BILL. AND WHAT THE WAS IT KIND OF SERVER CAME FROM AND THAT USUALLY KEEPS US OUT OF TROUBLE. DIFFERENT WAYS DIFFERENT PEOPLE ARE DOING THIS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- WE FOUND ONLINE AT AND IT IT EXPLAINS WHY EIGHTIES SOMETIMES PEOPLE DON'T NOTICE THESE THINGS -- SOMETIMES OUR MINDS CAN MAKE A SEE WHAT WE EXPECT TO SEE. MOST OF YOU CAN GO UP THERE AND START READING THROUGH THAT AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S TERRIBLY TERRIBLY MISSPELLED. IS ALREADY POINTED OUT JUST WITH SPELLINGS AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU CAN READ RIGHT THROUGH THAT -- YOUR YOUR YOUR MIND PUTS THE FIGURES TOGETHER. AND THAT'S WHAT THE TOWN ON WILL SEND SOME OF THESE THINGS THIS IS SIMILAR TO AN EMAIL THEY SENT OUT WAS. AND THE EMAIL THAT THEY HAD WAS WAS PERFECTLY BE. LOCATED EXCEPT. MANY OF THE EMAIL NAMES WERE CHANGED THE ADDRESSES WHAT THEY HAD DONE WAS IS THEY THEY PUT LIKE. YOU KNOW WELL AND RESPECT BY TRUCK LIKE A G. MAIL DOT COM BECAME CHUCK THAT LET THAT G. MAIL AT MSN DOT COM IS A QUICK LOOK NOBODY NOTICED ANYTHING WRONG BECAUSE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU USUALLY DO. IS LOOK AT THOSE -- CHUCK THAT LET IT GO BACK COM BETWEEN TRUCK THAT LACK THAT BILL BACK AT CS DOT COM. THOSE WOULD NOT GO ANYWHERE BECAUSE THOSE AREN'T REAL EMAIL. THE ONLY PERSON THAT GAP THAT EMAIL EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKED LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE WAS COPIED. WAS THE UNFORTUNATE PERSON THAT WAS GOING TO THIS AND OUT MONEY. WE HAVE WE TALKED ABOUT REALTORS AND NOT UNDERSTANDING. AS IT PROFESSIONALS AND SOMETIMES BEING A AND I THINK OUR AVERAGE AGE FOR REALTORS ABOUT FIFTY FOUR YEARS OLD IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE CLIENTS THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME EVER IN THE HISTORY OF LIFE THAT THEY HAVE SPENT OUT A WIRE TRANSFER AND GO UP TO THE BANK SAID I NEED YOUR HELP TO DO THIS AND THIS IS WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO. AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT. SO WE'RE NOT A WE'RE ACTUALLY WHEN PEOPLE ARE WATCHING US AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. OF PEOPLE DO WATCHES THESE TV EMAIL. THEY THEY WILL FOR WRITING AN ENTIRE. THEY HAVE THIS ALL PREPARED THEY ENDED UP THEIR TIMING IS PERFECT AND THEY END UP GETTING THEM UP INSTEAD OF THE THE RIGHTFUL PEOPLE. THIS IS A GREAT MAGAZINE ARTICLE IT WAS MARCH ELEVENTH TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHAT I TRY TO DO. IS WE WE INSTRUCT OUR RATE AND SO ON AND THIS TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION. BUT OF COURSE. THEY'RE USING A LOT OF ELSE. SO EACH ONE IS DONE DIFFERENTLY. WE HAVE A TECH PERSON THAT WE HAVE IN EACH OF OUR OFFICES THAT. ASSIST THEM WE'RE TRYING TO GET THAT DONE ENOUGH HOME WE'VE HAD PROBLEMS THIS IS A BIG PROBLEM IN THE HISTORY MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION. ON YOUR MAILS SO WE LOOK FOR A PROGRAM RIBBON IT'S GOT YOU TWO VIDEOS AND TELL YOU HOW TO DO IT. BUT SMALL IS INTERESTING BECAUSE IT COVERED AN AWFUL LOT OF THE DETAILS SO I DECIDED TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT. IN. IT COOPER G. EMAIL COPY COVERED YABU MAIL COVERED AT AM TEN MALE THEY HAVE TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION. THE CALL GOT VERY LONG BECAUSE AT THAT NECK AS IT KEPT GOING ON THERE'S FACTOR AUTHENTICATION TOOL AND NOT BASED. AND ON INSTAGRAM AT SAP AND TWITTER. FACEBOOK A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE IN REAL ESTATE USE THAT A GREAT DEAL BECAUSE THE HAVING AN OPEN HOUSE IT'S GOING TO BE HERE I HOPE YOU COME TO THAT. AND THAT GUYS TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND THEN START LOOKING FOR THAT ADDRESS IN THEIR EMAILS AS SOON AS IT GOES INTO ASTRO THEY START FOLLOWING THAT AS PRO. AND THEY'RE ABLE TO GET IT AT THE RIGHT TIME BUT THAT'S NOT ALL OF THEM. THEY GO THROUGH APPLE AND MICROSOFT AMAZON WE BUY A LOT OF MATERIAL SEE A YAHOO LINKED IN. A LOT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. SNAPCHAT REDDIT. PINTEREST SLAP DROPBOX ALL OF THESE WERE IN THEIR ARTICLE ALL OF THEM HAVE. TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION DROP BOXES WERE UP BY SHOULDN'T SAY THAT. THIS IS WHERE I KEEP ALL MY EMAILS BUT OF COURSE I'VE GOT THAT CORRECTED. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THOSE SOMEPLACE BECAUSE EACH ONE OF THESE TAKE DIFFERENT EMAILS AND JUST KEEP GOING AND GO. BY THE WAY EVERNOTE VAN -- WHICH IS WHAT YOU DO TO A BY UP A PAL WHICH IS HOW YOU SEND MONEY OUT TUMBLR. AND THERE'S TO SPECIFIC PROGRAM. THAT ARE IN THIS ARTICLE THAT WERE RECOMMENDED BY P. C. MAGAZINE KEEP ALL YOUR EMAIL PASS OFF THEIR PASSWORDS IN AND THEY HAVE TO FACTOR UP AND THE QUE. BY THE WAY THERE'S OTHERS YOU DON'T THINK OF MASKED. OF BRINGING A TEAMVIEWER WORDPRESS GO DADDY. MAILCHIMP WHERE WE HAVE ALL THESE THINGS YOU KNOW ALLOWS PEOPLE TO HEAR WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR HOUSE OR PERHAPS TO SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR HOUSE. THEY HAVE. TO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION TO MAKE BETTER SERVICES MORE SECURE. OF AND FINALLY SQUARE IN KICKSTARTER KICKSTARTER IS A PROGRAM THAT THEY USE. THE SOMEBODY'S GOT A PROBLEM THEY WANT TO SET UP A FUND LIKE GO FOR ME. AND YOU CAN IMAGINE PEOPLE WILL END UP WITH DOING A GREAT JOB RAISING MONEY FOR SOMEBODY AND THEN THE NEXT THING YOU FIND OUT AT ALL IT'S ALL GONE. TURBOTAX THEY'LL LEARN EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU AND SEE A BIG IS SHOPPING. SO CYBER SECURITY IS NOT JUST ABOUT EMAIL SAID ABOUT EVERYTHING WE DEAL WITH. AND WAS CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET POSSIBLY RESPOND REFERRED REFRIGERATOR AND THEN BECOME A DOORWAY TO CYBER CRIMES. IN CLOSING I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU A SHORT STORY ABOUT ONE OF MY AGENTS TRUE STORY. BUT IN THREE YEARS HE'S HAD THREE PROBLEMS. OF WHICH IS MID SIXTIES. YOUR ONE HE CAME HOME TO FIND BOXES OF COMPUTERS ON HIS PORCH SOMEONE HACKED INTO IS CREDIT CARD AND ORDERED A LOT OF EXPENSIVE COMPUTERS. THEY WERE NOTIFIED WHEN THEY WOULD BE DELIVERED AND PLACED ON HIS PORCH -- THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE TO PICK THEM UP BUT GOOD NEWS FOR BUSH HE LIVES IN A GATED COMMUNITY AND THEY COULDN'T GET THROUGH THE GATE. SO HE WAS ABLE TO RETURN ALL THE THINGS AND THEN HE SIGNED UP. WITH -- IN IDENTITY PROTECTION COMPANY AND TRYING TO PROTECT THAT BUT THAT DIDN'T SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS BECAUSE NEXT YEAR. HE SUBMITTED HIS TAX RETURN AND HE GOT A NOTE BACK FROM THE IRS SAYING THAT WELL. YOU KNOW YOU'VE SUBMITTED THE WRONG FORM YOU'VE ALREADY SUBMITTED YOUR YOUR TAX RETURN WE'VE ALREADY SENT YOU THE RETURN AND AND THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE REFUNDED YOU. AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE A DIFFERENT FORM IF YOU'RE GOING. TO MAKE A CORRECTION HE SAYS I NEVER FILED ANY TAXES AND WHEN THEY CHECKED ON IT IT WENT TO SOME PLACE IN KANSAS. NOT TO HIS HOME ADDRESS YEAR. THREE AND BY THE WAY IF SOMEBODY HAS GOT TO MESS AROUND WITH THE IRS THESE PEOPLE HAVE ALL THE COURAGE IN THE WORLD. YOUR THREE BOOKS RECEIVED A LETTER FROM SOCIAL SECURITY IN JUNE -- SAYING THAT THEY WERE ADJUSTING HIS PAYMENTS BECAUSE OF THE YOU KNOW HOW THEY COMPUTER THINGS. HE NEVER APPLIED FOR A PENSION. SO HE CALL THEM AND THEY CHECKED AND THEY WERE SENDING TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR CHECKS EVERY MONTH TO A BANK. IN ATLANTA. SO WHEN THEY CHECK THEIR BANK -- THE ACCOUNT HAD FIFTY DOLLARS AND IT AT THAT POINT AND THAT WAS IT. AND THEN BUSH NEEDED HELP ACTUALLY RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM. FROM A SOCIAL SECURITY HE WAS SO FRUSTRATED THEY TOLD ME TO TAKE TWO YEARS TO STRAIGHTEN THAT OUT AND DURING THAT TIME HE COULD NOT APPLY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY HE WALKED ACROSS THE JULIA BROWNLEE'S OFFICE AND ASK FOR THEIR HELP IN TRYING TO GET IT STRAIGHTENED OUT. ONE PERSON. THREE HUGE PROBLEMS AND THESE ABSOLUTELY HAPPEN TO OWN HE HAS A CLOUD ON IS OVER AS HEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI EVERYBODY MY NAME IS JIM CASE -- I'M WITH BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY. I AM NOW IN THE RISK MANAGEMENT BUSINESS IN THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS -- THIS IS MY FORTY FIFTH YOU'RE IN THE BUSINESS. AND IT'S NOT QUITE THE SAME TODAY AS IT WAS FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO -- OBVIOUSLY THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS WIRE FRAUD BACK THEN -- SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. CAME OUT WITH THE FORM IT'S CALLED A WIRE FRAUD ALERT -- IT'S PROBABLY BEEN AROUND FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS NOW MAYBE SIX AND WHEN I GOT IN THE BUSINESS WHEN A PROPERTY CLOSED ESCROW. THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FIFTEEN SIXTEEN PIECES OF PAPER IN THE FILE. THAT WAS ALL THAT WAS THERE -- THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT BACK THEN WAS A SINGLE PAGE -- TODAY ONE AN ESCROW CLOSES THERE PROBABLY. RIGHT AROUND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PIECE OF PAPER IN THAT FILE -- SO IT'S QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT. AND ONLY ONE OF THOSE PIECES OF PAPER -- DEALS WITH WIRE FRAUD. WHAT WE TEACH OUR PEOPLE AND I'M SURE WHAT CHUCK DOES AS WELL? IS THAT PARTICULAR FORM CANNOT BE TREATED AS JUST ANOTHER PIECE OF PAPER IN THE FILE. THAT IS A FORM OF WHERE YOU WANT TO HAVE A REAL CONVERSATION. WITH. YOUR CLIENT [INAUDIBLE] ON ESCROW COMPANIES DO NOT CHANGE BANK ACCOUNTS THEY DON'T CHANGE WIRING INSTRUCTIONS. IT DOESN'T I'VE BEEN VERY FOR FORTY TWO YEARS TO AN ESCROW OFFICER -- THERE ARE GOING TO BE. EMAILS LEGITIMATE EMAILS GOING OUT TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF AN ESCROW INSTRUCTING PEOPLE TO SEND THEIR MONEY TO SOMEWHERE OTHER THAN. THEY WERE TOLD OF THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE TRANSACTION. SO. IT IS THE REALTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH THEIR CLIENTS -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT -- MULTI FACTOR AUTHENTICATION. OR AUTHORIZATION AND IT'S SOMETHING IS REALLY NEEDED IN THIS INDUSTRY -- TONY WALL FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND I HAVE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME TALKING ABOUT THIS. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO OF MAKE IT SO THAT WOULD BE KIND OF AN AUTOMATIC THING A MANDATORY THING -- THAT'S NOT AN EASY THING TO DO -- YOU -- I KNOW JACQUI HAS WORKED WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WITH OUR PEOPLE IN SACRAMENTO -- I'M NOT SURE WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING THAT -- CORD OR WILL BE LEGISLATED -- IT'S SOMETHING IT'S NEEDED IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT -- IS NOT SOMETHING THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS CAN DO BECAUSE ALL REAL ESTATE LICENSEES ARE NOT A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. OF FOR EXAMPLE IN THE RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE TWO HUNDRED AND AROUND TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN THOUSAND MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. BUT THERE ARE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND REAL ESTATE LICENSEES ALL OF WHOM. CAN SELL REAL ESTATE. BUT THEY ARE NOT -- THEY'RE NOT UNDER OPERATE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF ALL OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. IT'S A PROMISE ONE DISC THIS GOT A MEETING AND IT'S NOT JUST THE BIG IT'S IT'S NOT AS BIG DOLLAR THINGS -- DO YOU HAVE THAT SLIDE. OKAY -- THERE'S AN ORGANIZATION HERE IN VENTURA -- INVENTOR ACCOUNTING THOSE OF YOU IN THE ROOM OR REALTORS I'VE HEARD OF IT SOME OF YOU HAVE NOT. IT'S CALLED REACH OUT THE REAL ESTATE FRAUD ADVISORY TEAM. ALL WE'VE BEEN IN EXISTENCE SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND FIVE IT'S A WONDERFUL PLACE TO GO FOR RESOURCES WE HAVE CONTACT INFORMATION FOR BASICALLY ALL GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES CONTRACTORS LICENSE BOARD. OF CALIFORNIA BAR ASSOCIATION IT CETERA ETCETERA -- WE HAVE -- CONSUMER ALERTS UP THERE BASICALLY EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN PUT OUT BY THE VENTURA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF REAL ESTATE -- BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS OF THE ALL KINDS OF TIPS LIKE I SAID ALL OF THE ALL CYBER CRIME IS NOT IT'S NOT MAJOR STUFF. OF THERE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR AT LEAST SEVEN OR EIGHT YEARS -- A FRAUD SO FAR AS RENTAL PROPERTIES OF OUR OUR CONCERN -- SOMEBODY WILL TAKE -- THEY'LL THEY'LL GO ON ZILLOW ORDER REALTOR DOT COM OR SOME OR OR OR SOMEPLACE LIKE THAT. THEY WILL. STILL THE PHOTOS OF THE HOME THAT IS CURRENTLY ON THE MARKET FOR SALE. THEY WILL PUT IT ON CRAIG'S LIST FOR RENT -- EVERY INCREDIBLE OF AN INCREDIBLY REASONABLE RATE OF RENT TYPICALLY ABOUT 50% OF WHAT THE PROPERTY WOULD NORMALLY RENT. FOR AND BASICALLY ADD WILL SAY THE YOU KNOW THAT EITHER THEIR THE TENANT THAT'S IN THERE THEY'RE LEAVING -- FULL STORY ABOUT THE PERSON -- WHO IS MASQUERADING AS THE OWNER THAT HE HAS SIGNED UP TO BE A MISSIONARY SOMEPLACE IN A THIRD WORLD COUNTRY FOR TWO YEARS HE JUST WANTS SOMEBODY TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF THE HOUSE -- THERE WAS A CASE IN BODEGA BAY IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT'S WERE ALFRED. HITCHCOCK'S THE BIRDS WAS FELT OR RENTED THE SAME. PROPERTY FOR A WEEK IN THE SUMMERTIME. THEY ALL SHOWED UP ON THE SAME SUNDAY MORNING. TO MOVE IN FOR THEIR WEEK SURVEY CATION -- THEY ALL PAID UP FRONT WHICH YOU NORMALLY DO WITH A THING LIKE THAT. SO SOMEBODY COLLECTED -- LIKE THIRTY SOMETHING THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM SIX DIFFERENT FAMILIES IN THE PLACE WASN'T EVEN AVAILABLE FOR RENT TO ANYBODY. SO OF ONE OF THE THINGS AND FOR YOU REALTORS WITH THOSE OF YOU ARE NOT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE FOUND TO BE HELPFUL REAL QUICKLY. IS ONE OF OUR COLLATERAL PIECES. IS THIS AND BASICALLY WHAT IT SAYS IS WARNING THIS PROPERTY IS NOT FOR RENT -- IT'S AVAILABLE HONOR THE IS AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE ANY PROPERTY THAT'S ON THE MARKET ESPECIALLY LIKE A VACANT PROPERTY. ALL WE HAVE OUR AGENTS PULL ONE OF THESE OUR FRONT WINDOW. SO SOMEBODY LOOKING AT THE HOUSE JUST IN CASE IT DOES COME UP ON CRAIG'S LIST FOR RENT -- THEY WILL KNOW THAT THE PROPERTIES NOT FOR RENT AND IT HAS THE INFORMATION. AS TO WHO TO CONTACT OF THE FBI'S. CYBER SITE IC THREE DOT GOV. IS NOTATED ON AUG ON THE PAGE THERE'S ALL KINDS OF GOOD STUFF THERE -- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS -- IF I HAVE ONE MORE MINUTE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THOUGHT ABOUT -- YOU'VE ALL HEARD OF THE CONCEPT OF SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION RIGHT. IT'S BEEN AROUND SINCE. NINETEEN TWENTY NINE YOU KNOW WHERE EVERYBODY THROUGH SIX OR FEWER CONTACTS. WOULD BE APPOINTED WITH EVERYBODY ON THE FACE OF THE PLANET. OKAY WHAT WAS SOCIAL MEDIA NOW. MAYBE IT'S FIVE DEGREES OF SEPARATION MAYBE IT'S FOUR POINT FIVE I DON'T KNOW. YOUR FORTY MILLION PEOPLE ROUGHLY IN CALIFORNIA -- MORE THAN 80% OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE HAVE INTERNET ACCESS. AND MORE THAN 50% -- CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN 50% OR ON FACEBOOK [INAUDIBLE] SO. WHAT I AM PROPOSING EVEN IN THE SMALL ROOM LIKE THIS IS A SMALL LITTLE SOCIAL EXPERIMENT? IF YOU PICKED UP ANY TIDBITS TODAY SO FAR AS WIRE FRAUD OR WHATEVER. FROM TONY OR KI&LT;C.CYAN&GT; OR WHATEVER.&LT;/C&GT; WHY NOT POST THAT? ON YOUR FACEBOOK PAGE OR ON TWITTER OR ANY PLACE ELSE WITH THE HATCH HASH TAG THAT SAYS SOMETHING LIKE. HASHTAG STOP SCAMMERS SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND SEND IT OUT TO ALL OF YOUR ACQUAINTANCES ON WHATEVER SOCIAL MEDIA NETWORK YOU USING WITH A REQUEST THAT THEY SEND THAT. TO EVERYBODY THEY KNOW NOW IT'S NOT GOING TO BECOME VIRAL LIKE A CUTE LITTLE PUPPY ON ON THE INTERNET. BUT IF WE SPREAD THE WORD IF WE TRY TO SPREAD THE WORD AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN. IF WE CAN STOP TWO ONE EVEN ONE PERSON. FROM MAKING THE MISTAKE OF SENDING AWAY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF THE NEVER GOING TO SEE AGAIN. WOULD BE WELL WORTH THE EFFORT. AND I THANK YOU. THANK YOU NANCY. YES GOOD MORNING AND NANCY LYNN HOME CEO THE OXNARD CHAMBER OF COMMERCE -- WELL WE HAVE -- SOME VERY LARGE VERY PROSPEROUS BUSINESSES IN OXNARD THAT PROVIDE. THOUSANDS OF JOBS -- 85% OF OUR MEMBERS AT THE ACTS ARE CHAMBER. HAVE -- TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES OR FEWER. SO AS THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN STATED THAT IN HER OPENING REMARKS A SMALL BUSINESS CERTAINLY IS THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY. SOME AND WE SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW THAT SMALL BUSINESSES DO NOT HAVE SECURITY OR IT PROFESSIONALS ON STAFF -- THEY RELY ON OUTSIDE SERVICES TO ADVISE AND PROTECT THEM -- AND THE OX ARE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IS A SMALL BUSINESS WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE DATA WE COLLECT -- FROM OUR MEMBERS OUR CUSTOMERS JUST AS ANY OTHER SMALL BUSINESS WOULD I'M. COMMUNICATING CYBERSECURITY BEST PRACTICES TO SMALL BUSINESSES IT'S CERTAINLY A CHALLENGE. OF WERE ALL OVERWHELMED WITH. BY INFORMATION THAT WE GET VIA SOCIAL MEDIA. ELECTRONIC NEWSLETTERS EMAILS -- AND GETTING AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE OUT -- BEYOND ALL THE OTHER NOISE IS SOMEWHAT DAUNTING -- WE PUSH OUT A LOT OF WARNINGS TO OUR MEMBERS AND THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. ON ALL KINDS OF TOPICS SUCH AS NEW LABOR LAWS PENDING LEGISLATION. CHANGES TO REGULATIONS LOCALLY -- HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO REALLY CRITICAL ISSUES -- I KINDA GO BACK IN TIME AND I PICK UP THE PHONE -- IT'S IT'S IT'S A TIME CONSUMING THING TO DO. BUT SINCE MANY PEOPLE -- LET THE EMAILS JUST PILE UP IN THE NEWS LETTERS KIND OF GET FILED AWAY. I HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF REALLY GETTING -- AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE THROUGH A VIA A PHONE CALL. AND OF COURSE THESE DAYS NOT MANY PEOPLE COMMUNICATE VIA PHONE SO THAT'S A LITTLE CHALLENGING AS WELL -- AS FAR AS COMMUNICATING THE BEST PRACTICES -- AND CYBERSECURITY I THINK WE NEED. TO REALLY RELY ON THE IT COMPANIES TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR SMALL BUSINESS CLIENTS. I KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY SOMETHING THEY WERE THERE THEY DO ON A REGULAR BASIS BUT TO MAKE THEM AWARE OF THESE SCAMS -- AND ALSO WE HAVE A NEED TO LAUNCH A COORDINATED COMMUNICATIONS PLAN. TO EDUCATE SMALL BUSINESSES -- ON ALL OF THE CYBER THREATS THAT WE CURRENTLY KNOW ABOUT AND WE'RE HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT -- COORDINATED COMMUNICATION EFFORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH [INAUDIBLE] MR SURE. WELL I'M GONNA FOLLOW UP ON THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS -- VERY GOOD AND I THINK -- WE CAN TAKE THAT TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER NOW. WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING ABOUT OUR DISCUSSIONS TODAY IS THAT. WE'RE NOT REALLY TALKING ABOUT HACKERS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SCAMMERS. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO DO SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKS. NOW WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO TALKED ABOUT HACKER ONE AND THE BROWNIES AND ALL OF THAT STUFF AT THE END OF THE DAY. THE WAY THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE GETTING. IS BY TRICKING US. RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S HOW WE'RE GETTING TAKEN IS BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING TRICKED. AND SO THEN YOU ASK YOU SIR YOU ASK YOURSELF THE QUESTION HOW DO WE NOT GET TRICKED [INAUDIBLE] RIGHT. AND SO -- ACCORDING TO VERIZON'S DATA BREACH INCIDENT REPORT TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT JUST CAME OUT 93% [INAUDIBLE] OF BREECHES ARE DUE TO HUMAN ERROR. OKAY. AND SO LET'S FIGURE OUT A WAY TO STOP HUMAN ERROR. AND SECURITY WHERE IT'S IN GENERAL LIKE IF YOU'RE GOING TO A LARGER ORGANIZATION FIVE YEARS AGO. THEY WOULD SHOW YOU A FORTY FIVE MINUTE LONG DEATH BY POWER POINT. WE'RE ALL YOU WANTED TO DO IS GO CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK AND GET TO THE VERY END AS FAST AS YOU COULD. RIGHT. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT WAS A CHECK THE BOX EXERCISE FOR THEM. THAT REALLY DID NOTHING TO EDUCATE THEIR EMPLOYEES ON CYBERSECURITY -- BUT IT MEANT A COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS DOESN'T WORK. AND SO WE HAVE. THREE BIG PROBLEMS. THAT WE FACE IN THE CYBERSECURITY TRAINING WORLD -- THAT NEED TO BE OVERCOME BY OUR SECURITY AWARENESS PROGRAM RIGHT. THE FIRST BIG PROBLEM IS THE HUMAN ATTENTION SPAN IS DOWN 33% FROM THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TO THE YEAR. TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THAT WAS A MICROSOFT ADVERTISING STUDY THAT THEY DID. IT WOULD FROM EIGHT SECONDS TO SIX SECONDS. THE HUMAN ATTENTION SPAN OF A CATERPILLARS EIGHT SECONDS. OURS IS SIX WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. IF WE ARE NOT ENGAGED. IN WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE'RE WATCHING THAT WE'RE LEARNING THERE WERE HEARING ABOUT IN THE FIRST SIX SECONDS. WE'RE GONNA REMIND TO OUR MINDS GO SOMEWHERE ELSE 90% OF THE TIME WHERE THEY GO WE PICK UP OUR FULL. AND SEE JUST HOW MANY LIKE THREE GOT IN OUR LAST INSTAGRAM POST. RIGHT SEC THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM IS IT IS ATTENTION SPAN WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATING [INAUDIBLE] OUR EMPLOYEES. ON CYBER AWARENESS AND SO HOW DO WE SOLVE FOR THAT. WHAT WE SAW FOR THAT BY MAKING THE TRAINING THAT WE DO FUN ENGAGING AND INTERESTING RIGHT AND SO WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE IS SETTING UP? FOR FOR SMALL BUSINESS TO SET UP OR HAVE. EITHER ON YOUR OWN OR WITH THE HELP OF A COMPANY LIKE US TO SET UP A FULL FLEDGED SECURITY AWARENESS PROGRAM FOR YOUR EMPLOYEES. ARM THE SECOND BIG PROBLEM IS THAT HACKERS INNOVATE. THERE ARE A MILLION NEW PIECES OF MALWARE. THAT ARE DEVELOPED. NOT RELEASED OUT TO THE WORLD. A MILLION NEW PIECES OF OUR THAT ARE DEVELOPED EVERY DAY. TO CRAZY STATISTIC. AND THEN THE LAST -- ISSUE THAT WE HAVE IS THAT. WHEN WE DO CYBER AWARENESS TRAINING A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS THEY DON'T HAVE FREQUENCY? THEY DON'T HAVE CONSISTENCY. RIGHT. AND I'M GONNA GIVE YOU KIND OF A CRUDE EXAMPLE OF WHAT I MEAN HERE BY HOW HOW FREQUENCY IS GONNA CURE CURIOSITY CURIOSITY. IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WE HAVE AS HUMANS. AS WE GET THAT EMAIL THAT SAYS WE JUST BEEN TAGGED ON FACEBOOK. AND WE'RE CURIOUS WE'LL SEE WHAT IT IS. BUT IF YOU HOWEVER I HAVE I HAVE OVER THE LINK CLEARLY IT DOESN'T GO TO FACEBOOK WE DON'T TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK AT IT WOULD SO WE CLICK ON IT ANYWAY [INAUDIBLE] RIGHT [INAUDIBLE] AND SO. CURIOSITY IS A BIG PROBLEM SO HOW WE CURE CURIOSITY MATTEL CRUDE STORY. SO LET'S JUST SAY I GET HOME TONIGHT FROM WORK. AND I GET A CALL FROM MY WIFE AND SHE'S CRYING. AND I'M LIKE HONEY WHAT'S WRONG. AND SHE SAYS WELL I JUST REAR ENDED A YOUNG WOMAN IN FRONT OF ME WERE BOTH OKAY I THINK I TOTALED HER CAR -- WE'RE BOTH FIND THAT I'M REALLY SHAKEN UP RIGHT NOW. A CIVIL WHAT HAPPENED. AND SHE SAID WELL I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET MY GIRLFRIENDS FOR DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT I FELT -- A BUZZ GO OFF IN MY PURSE -- IS ON THE FLOOR I REACH DOWN TO GRAB MY PHONE IS BANNED. REREAD THAT PERSON. AND SHE OBVIOUSLY AS SHE SHOULDN'T BE TEXTING AND DRIVING RIGHT. SO THE NEXT DAY COMES I'M ON MY WAY TO WORK. I'M WAITING FOR THIS REALLY BIG DEAL TO COME THROUGH. MY PHONE WAS OFF IN MY POCKET. I'M ABOUT TO REACH FOR IT I DON'T [INAUDIBLE] WHY? BECAUSE OF THE STORY THAT I HEARD FROM MY WIFE LAST NIGHT. THE PROXIMITY OF THE EVENT. CHANGED MY HUMAN BEHAVIOR. OKAY. SIX MONTHS GO BY. INSURANCE IS TAKING CARE OF EVERYTHING EVERYTHING'S COOL. I GET A BUZZ IN MY POCKET. UPON MY PHONE OUT AND I LOOK AT IT. BECAUSE NOW THAT EVENT IS IN THE BACK OF MY BRAIN. MY WHOLE POINT HERE IS THAT. EMPLOYERS SMALL BUSINESSES. NEED TO SET UP A PROGRAM. THAT HAS FREQUENCY WHERE YOU'RE TOUCHING YOUR USERS AT LEAST THREE TIMES A MONTH. WITH SOMETHING. THAT IS ABOUT SECURITY AWARENESS. AND IS SOMETHING THAT IS ENGAGING AND IS GOING TO GET THEIR ATTENTION. RIGHT WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE RUNNING AROUND -- PARANOID. BUT WE DO WANT OUR EMPLOYEES RUNNING AROUND WITH THEIR ANTENNAS UP. THE RADAR GOING. SO THAT THEY ARE A LOT MORE CAREFUL. WHEN THEY'RE SITTING IN FRONT OF THEIR PC? IT THE END OF THE DAY. WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO DO IS CREATE A CULTURE? OF SECURITY AWARENESS WITHIN OUR ORGANIZATION. ONE OF THE WAYS THAT WE DO IT NGO AND I'M GONNA OFFER THIS AT THE EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE HERE. IS WE HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED FAMILY USE RIGHTS. AND SO WHEN YOU'RE SUBSCRIBER TO OUR PLATFORM. YOU CAN ADD UP TO FIVE FAMILY MEMBERS TO RECEIVE OUR VIDEOS THAT VIDEO YOU SAW WE DO ONE OF THOSE EVERY THIRTY DAYS. AND SO YOU CAN -- SUBSCRIBER FOR UP TO FIVE FAMILY MEMBERS TO RECEIVE THIS VIDEO AS WELL. SO NOW THE SPOUSE COMES HOME. FROM WORK SITTING AROUND THE DINNER TABLE. THE YES SIGN EPISODE ON A WATERING HOLE ATTACK ON MALVERN TIES SING OR AND KEYSTROKE LOGGING RIGHT WE'VE GOT ALL OF THOSE EPISODES COVER. AND THEY HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT IT. AND WHAT HAPPENS IS. YOU'VE NOW STARTED THAT CONVERSATION WITHIN THE FAMILY UNIT. OF SECURITY AWARENESS AND CREATING A SECURITY AWARE CULTURE WITHIN THE FAMILY BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY THINK ABOUT IT WE GET HACKED AT WORK. WITH RANSOMWARE WORK WE GET RANSOMWARE HOME WE GET FISH TO WORK WE GET FISHED AT HOME RIGHT. EVERYONE OF THESE BREACHES HAPPENS IN BOTH PLACES. IN THIS PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED IT HOME. WE ARE -- IN A LOT MORE OF A DIRE SITUATION BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE AS MANY BLINKING LIGHTS IN THE DATA CENTER THAT WE DO IT WORK. THERE ARE YOU KNOW PIECES OF SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE TO PROTECT OURSELVES. SO GETTING EMPLOYEES TO MAKE A PARADIGM SHIFT. THAT THE SECURITY AWARENESS TRAINING THAT THEY GET. SURE IT'S DELIVERED BY THEIR EMPLOYER TO PROTECT THEIR EMPLOYER BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WHAT YOU REALLY WANT IS YOUR EMPLOYEE TO TAKE A PERSONAL ATTACHMENT. TO BEING SECURITY WHERE. BECAUSE THEY CAN VAN -- VIEW SECURITY AWARENESS TRAINING FROM YOUR ORGANIZATION AS AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT. IS A FOUR MINUTE BREAK OUT OF THEIR WORK DAY. AND ONCE THAT PARADIGM SHIFT IS HAPPENING THAT EMPLOYEE THE SECURITY OF YOUR ORGANIZATION GOES UP. EXPONENTIALLY. BECAUSE NOW THEY'RE PROTECTING THEMSELVES THEY'RE PROTECTING THEIR FAMILIES THEY'RE PROTECTING THEIR ORGANIZATIONS. AS OF I CAN JUST LEAVE YOU WITH YOU KNOW A FEW THOUGHTS. EVERY ORGANIZATION ON THE PLANET I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE THREE PEOPLE. ARE FIVE PEOPLE. YOU NEED A FORMAL SECURITY AWARENESS TRAINING PROGRAM IN PLACE. IT NEEDS TO BE FUN AND EDUCATING THE SAME TIME IT NEEDS TO BE SERIOUS. IT NEEDS TO HAVE FREQUENCY. SO THE PEOPLE ARE CONSTANTLY REINFORCED ON WHAT THEY'RE BEING TAUGHT. BECAUSE IF YOU DO IT ONCE IN OCTOBER IN SECURITY AWARENESS MONTH AND THEN YOU DON'T TOUCH IT AGAIN UNTIL FEBRUARY. FORGET ABOUT IT SECOND WORK. SO THAT'S A I GUESS MY WORDS OF WISDOM -- FOR THE DAY. OUT. MY EMAIL ADDRESS IF IF ANYBODY WANTS TO WRITE IT DOWN. IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE IT'S ZACK Z. A C. K.. AT NINJA O. N. I. N. J. I. O. DOT COM. IF YOU SEND ME AN EMAIL AND JUST SAY. I SAW YOU AT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS -- WOULD RECALLING THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. PLEASE ADD ME TO FAMILY USE RIGHTS. I WILL ADD YOU. YOU WILL ALL GET ONE OF OUR EPISODE EVERY THIRTY DAYS AT NO COST. JUST FOR YOU AT LEAST SECOND. GIVE EVERYBODY IN THE AUDIENCE HERE SOMETHING. I THOUGHT GOT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND AND THIS WAS AGAIN VERY INFORMATIVE AND AND ZACH I LOVE HOW PASSIONATE YOU ARE ABOUT TO MAKING SURE WE ALL STAY SAFE AND JUST TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN WITH ALL OF YOU IN YOUR ORGANIZATIONS WHETHER IT'S THREE OR THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE. THE EMPLOYEES IN YOUR ORGANIZATION ARE ALWAYS THE WEAK LINK SO. THE REGULAR TRAINING THE REGULAR TOUCHES IS SOMETHING THAT WILL DEFINITELY -- KEEP YOUR BUSINESS MORE SECURE SO -- CAN WE HAVE A ROUND OF APPLAUSE FOR OUR SECOND PANEL PLEASE. AND NOW FOR OUR LAST PANEL -- AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THEM FLYING IN WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE CYBER SECURITY BEST PRACTICES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. AND PROFESSIONALS AND THEIR SO -- YOU GUYS ARE READY M. SEATED WITH US TO HEAR HERE TODAY. TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT YOU HOPEFULLY ANSWER THE QUESTIONS YOU HAVE AS A KNOWLEDGEABLE PANEL FROM LEADING COMPANIES IN THE CYBERSECURITY SPACE. I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME DAVID KOHLBERG WHO IS THE SENIOR DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS -- FOR PALO ALTO NETWORKS AND ROB SYDELL SKI WHO IS THE TRUST AND SECURITY LEAD FOR GOOGLE CLOUD WELCOME GENTLEMEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR JOINING US HERE IN VENTURA COUNTY [INAUDIBLE] THANK YOU [INAUDIBLE] BROUGH [INAUDIBLE] OKAY -- GREAT -- GOOD MORNING AND AND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO TO SPEAK TO THE ASSEMBLY HERE -- MY NAME'S ROB SAID OWSKI -- AS HE SAID I AM THE TRUST AND SECURITY LEAD FOR GOOGLE CLOUD A GOOGLE WHERE I WORK WITH OUR PRODUCT TEAMS WHO DEVELOP SECURITY PRODUCTS AND RUN GOOGLE SERVICES THAT HELP BUSINESSES PROTECT THEIR USERS. THEIR SENSITIVE DATA IN THEIR APPLICATIONS -- OF WORKING INFORMATION SECURITY FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS INCLUDING SERVING ON THE PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY SECURITY STANDARDS COUNCIL BOARD OF ADVISORS WHERE I GOT TO SEE. IN SHAPE A LOT OF FIRST HAND THE REGULATIONS TO PROTECT CREDIT CARD DATA -- HERE IN THE US AND ABROAD WHICH IS A MAJOR FOCUS AS WE'VE SEEN OUR CYBER CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND SOURCE OF DATA BREACHES. AND WHILE THE CYBER THREAT LANDSCAPE CONTINUES TO GROW AND EVOLVE AND PRESENT NEW CHALLENGES FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES ALIKE. BUSINESSES OF EVERY SIZE HAVE NEVER HAD ACCESS TO THE TOOLS AND CAPABILITIES AND TECHNOLOGIES AND EXPERTISE TO HELP THEM DEAL WITH THE BUSINESS CHALLENGE OF CYBER SECURITY. AS THEY DO TODAY AND THAT'LL BE THE FOCUS OF MY REMARKS THE BEST PRACTICES AND CAPABILITIES THAT TODAY'S BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE LARGE AND SMALL. CAN ADOPT TO HELP MAKE THEM MORE RESILIENT IN THE FACE OF CYBERCRIME AND CYBER THREATS -- TO HAVE MY MY VISUALS -- OKAY -- THINGS WERE FINE [INAUDIBLE] BOB PROGRAM [INAUDIBLE] OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT ME TO GO YEAH WHY DON'T YOU GO YES THAT WOULD BE GREAT AT SIX DOLLARS A TIME FOR A WHILE WE'RE LOOKING. FOR SURE -- TO MANAGER THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY -- TO PURE BEFORE YOU DISCUSS THE POLICIES PARTNERSHIPS AND TECHNOLOGY INNOVATIONS -- ENABLING THE CYBERSECURITY OF THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY. ORDER FIRST THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. AND OFFER OUR COMMITMENT TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH YOU AND YOUR STAFF TO SUPPORT THE COMMITTEE'S. OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES -- WE COLLECTIVELY SEEK TO BOLSTER CALIFORNIA'S ENTER NATION SECURITY POSTURE. MY COMMENTS TODAY ARE DESIGNED TO HELP IMPROVE SMALL BUSINESSES ABILITY DEFEND AGAINST INCREASINGLY AGILE. AND SOPHISTICATED CYBER THREATS BY OUTLINING OUR APPROACH TO PREVENTION. IN REVIEWING SOME OF THE KEY INITIATIVES AIMED AT IMPROVING THE OVERALL SECURITY POSTURE OF THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY. FOR EXPAND ON THESE KEY POINTS A LIKE TO BRIEFLY INTRODUCE MYSELF IN THE COMPANY AND PRIVILEGED TO REPRESENT -- AS YOU STATED MY NAME IS DAVID COLE OVER AGAIN I'VE SERVED AS POWER TO NETWORK SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR NEARLY THREE YEARS. IN THIS ROLE I BUILD STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS AND DRY POLICY DEVELOPMENT ALIGNED WITH CALL TO NETWORKS MISSION. TO MAKE THE WORLD A SAFER EACH DAY. BY PROTECTING OUR DIGITAL WAY OF LIFE. A PRIOR TO JOINING PALO ALTO NETWORKS A CERTAIN NUMBER OF POLICY ROLES ACROSS INDUSTRY AND ALSO HAD THE HONOR. OF SERVING FOR NEARLY A DECADE UNITED STATES NAVY. PRIMARILY AS A NAVAL FLIGHT OFFICER -- BUT WITH MY LAST ASSIGNMENT AS A SIGNATURE THE NAVY'S LIAISON OFFICER TO CONGRESS. ALL THE NETWORKS WAS FOUNDED TWO THOUSAND FIVE IN ESSENCE BECOME THE WORLD'S LEADING CYBERSECURITY COMPANY. EMPOWERING OVER SIXTY THOUSAND AND PRICE CUSTOMERS ACROSS ALL SECTORS IN OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE. OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REGARDLESS OF SIZE OR SECTOR. FIND THEMSELVES AT VARIOUS STAGES OF A OF A DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION JOURNEY. FOR SOME DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION MEANS LEVERAGING CLOUD CAPABILITIES TO IMPROVE OPERATIONAL COST EFFICIENCIES. FOR OTHERS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING ARE CRITICAL THE HARNESSING THE POWER AND VALUE OF AN ORGANIZATION'S DATA. TO ENHANCE BUSINESS PROCESSES OR IMPROVE ON THINGS LIKE CUSTOMER SERVICE. WHILE INNOVATIONS EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES LIKE CLOUD A I AND MACHINE LEARNING PRESENTS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES THE ALSO INTERNED INTRODUCED SIGNIFICANT RISK. IN OTHER WORDS DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION CANNOT OCCUR WITHOUT A PARALLEL SECURITY TRANSFORMATION. AND IT'S CRITICAL FOR POLICYMAKERS AND BOTH GOVERNMENT INDUSTRY LEADERS. TO UNDERSTAND THEIR ABILITY TO IMPACT THE SECURITY ELEMENTS OF THIS JOURNEY. ACHIEVING AN EFFECTIVE SECURITY TRANSFORMATION REQUIRES BOTH A STRONG UNDERSTANDING OF THE CURRENT THREAT ENVIRONMENT. AS WELL AS A CLEAR VISION FOR EMPLOYING THE PEOPLE PROCESSES AND TECHNOLOGY ORIA ORIENTED STRATEGIES. THAT CAN BE LEVERAGED TO MITIGATE THESE THREATS. THE NATURE OF THE THREAT WE FACE TODAY CAN MOST EASILY BE DESCRIBED AS A MATH BATTLE. COST OF COMPUTE HAS RAPID IT HAS BEEN RAPIDLY DECLINING ALLOWING OUR ADVERSARIES TO LAUNCH INCREASINGLY AUTOMATED. AND SOPHISTICATED ATTACKS AT MINIMAL COST. IN THE FACE OF THIS AUTOMATED ONSLAUGHT THE NETWORK DEFENDER IS GENERALLY RELYING ON LEGACY SECURITY TECHNOLOGIES. OFTEN COBBLE TOGETHER AS MULTIPLE LAYERS OF POINT PRODUCTS THAT'S ALL DISCRETE PROBLEMS. BUT DO NOT ENTER OPERATE AT THE LEVEL NEEDED TO COUNTER THE THREAT. THIS COMPLEXITY CREATES A DEPENDENCE ON PEOPLE THE LEAST SCALABLE RESOURCE IN ANY ORGANIZATION. TO MANUALLY DEFEND AGAINST AUTOMATED MACHINE GENERATED THE TAX. THE BOTTOM LINE IS THE GOOD GUYS ARE LOSING THEM OUT THAT'LL. LARGELY BECAUSE WE'RE BRINGING PEOPLE TO A SOFTWARE FIGHT. WELL INNOVATION IS CORNERSTONE TO ANY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS STRATEGY. WE ALSO IDENTIFIED HOW IT CAN ADD COMPLEXITY TO YOUR OVERALL RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. WITH THIS IN MIND -- LIKE TO DIVE A LITTLE DEEPER INTO HOW WE MAY IMPROVE EXISTING BEST PRACTICES AROUND INFORMATION SHARING. AND DRIVE MORE EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT INTO THE ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. ONE SUCH PRACTICE AND A FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE FACING SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESSES ALIKE. HE'S KEEPING PACE WITH THE LATEST CYBER THREATS THROUGH INFORMATION SHARING PROGRAMS. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT ROBUST AUTOMATED SHARING PROGRAMS EXIST. YOUR NONPROFIT ENTITIES LIKE THE CYBER THREAT ALLIANCE WERE CYBERSECURITY VENDORS ARE COOPERATING TO WIDELY AND AUTOMATICALLY DISTRIBUTE THREAT PROTECTIONS. DOWN TO SMALL BUSINESS LEVEL. WE'RE PROUD TO BE A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE CYBER THREAT ALLIANCE AND AND NOW INCLUDES TWENTY FOUR MEMBER COMPANIES INCLUDING THE SIX LARGEST CYBERSECURITY VENDORS IN THE WORLD. THE UNDERLYING CHALLENGE WITH SHARING THREAT INTELLIGENCE UNIQUE TO THE SECURITY SECTOR. IS THAT MANY CYBERSECURITY COMPANIES CONTINUE TO BE YOU CYBER THREAT INTELLIGENCE AS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. SO INSTEAD OF SHARING THIS CRITICAL DATA FREELY AND OPENLY. MANY STILL MARKET THE STATE AS PART OF A SALES STRATEGY. OUR COMPANY STANCE IS QUITE SIMPLE. YOU SHOULD COMPETE ON WHAT YOUR TECHNOLOGY DOES WITH CYBER THREAT INFORMATION RATHER THAN THE INFORMATION ITSELF. ONE EASY METHOD FOR GOVERNMENTS TO INCENTIVIZE EFFECTIVE INFORMATION SHARING IS TO SIMPLY ASK BUSINESSES SEEKING CONTRACTS IF THEY ARE MEMBERS OF THE CTA OR ANY ORGANIZATION LIKE IT. AND IF NOT WHY NOT. AND FINALLY WE MUST ALSO KEEP PACE WITH THE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS OF NEW INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGNS TO INCLUDE NEW CAPABILITIES LIKE NEXT GEN. NINE ONE ONE AND SMART CITIES. AND THE RAPID ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES LIKE FIVE G.. FOR EXAMPLE FIVE G. WILL INCREASE SPEED REDUCE LATENCY AND ALLOWS TO SIGNIFICANTLY RAMP UP WHAT RIGHTS ON OUR NETWORKS. A TRADITIONAL BREACH WITH THE NORMAL AND NORMALLY ANTICIPATED INFILTRATION OF PRIVACY WILL NOW INCLUDE PHYSICAL RISKS AND CONSEQUENCES. ON A MUCH GREATER SKILL. WE CAN'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES WE MADE IN THE PAST AND HOPE THE SLAPPING SECURITY ON AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT WILL SUFFICE. THIS IS POTENTIALLY AN AREA OF WHERE THE ASSEMBLY COULD CONSIDER ACTION -- OVERSIGHT TO ASSIST THE PROMISE OF FIVE G. ACCELERATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SMART CITIES CONNECTED CARS MEDICAL DEVICES I TEAM MORE. LEGISLATORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT WHAT FIVE G. OPENS THE DOOR TO EXCITING NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES IT ALSO INCREASES THE NUMBER OF POTENTIAL INTRUSION POINTS. AMPLIFYING THE SECURITY CONCERNS. MEDIC TO MITIGATE THE INCREASED RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FIVE G. WE MUST ENCOURAGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS TO ENSURE COMPLETE VISIBILITY AN AUTOMATED SECURITY. ACROSS ALL NETWORK LOCATIONS. THE SERVER ENVIRONMENT A RISING TIDE TRULY LIFTS ALL BOATS. SO WE'RE ON THE SAME BOAT TOGETHER. MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AND I WOULD FORTY ANSWERING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF THE AND WE'LL SEE IF THERE'S TIME FOR QUESTIONS AT THE END BUT IT IS A THEY ARE WE WE WERE RIGHT ON TO ICLOUD RIGHT. YES HOPEFULLY GOOGLE CLOUD -- FIVE YES GREAT. AND COMMUTE TO THE NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. GREAT -- SO THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US ON ON SO I KEEP GETTING THIS READY -- SO TO TO JUMP BACK IN SMALL BUSINESSES LEVERAGE YOU'LL TO GROW TO STAY SECURE AND SAVE TIME AND MONEY SO NOT ONLY DO THEY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR TOOLS TO COMMUNICATE TO REACH CUSTOMERS BUT INCREASINGLY. THEY DEPEND ON CLOUD SOFTWARE PROVIDERS LIKE GOOGLE AND OTHERS TO HELP THEM PROTECT THEIR BUSINESS. AND RATHER THAN HIRING EXPERTS OR BECOMING EXPERT THEMSELVES BOTH YOU VERY BIG CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF THE INDUSTRY WIDE SHORTAGE OF CYBER SECURITY SKILLS AND WORKERS AND A WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERABLE EXPENSE. THEY RELY ON THE EXPERTISE THE PROTECTION AND POWERFUL SECURITY CAPABILITIES THAT WE AND OTHER PROVIDERS OF BUILT INTO OUR PRODUCTS. IN OUR NEXT SLIDE PLEASE THEY NEED TO BECAUSE AS WE'VE HEARD ALREADY SECURITY THREATS TARGET BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES BUT OFTEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT SMALL BUSINESSES NO THE RESEARCH SHOWS IN WITH THIS IS BEEN CITED BY PREVIOUS. PRESENTERS THAT -- SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OF BREACHES TARGETING SMALL BUSINESSES SPECIFICALLY WHEN YOU COUPLE THIS WITH THE FACT THAT WE HEARD EARLIER THAT ALMOST HALF A SMALL BUSINESSES WOULD EXPECT TO CLOSE PERMANENTLY AFTER A DATA BREACH. THIS HAS SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES ON BOTH OUR ECONOMIES IN PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOODS I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE IF -- THE FACT THAT THE TOOL USED BY ALMOST EVERY SMALL BUSINESS FOR COMMUNICATING WITH EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS EMAIL IS THE MOST COMMON WAY CYBER ATTACKS START SO WE CLEARLY NEED SOLUTIONS. OUR NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. GOOGLE IS HEAVILY INVESTED IN STOPPING THIS MALICIOUS ACTIVITY PROTECTING USERS IN MAKING THE INTERNET SAFER FOR EVERYONE IN OUR SYSTEMS AND PRODUCTS. SO -- GOOGLE STOPS ON THE ORDER OF TEN MILLION SPAM AND MALICIOUS EMAILS A MINUTE ACROSS ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE SKIN ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND WEB PAGES EVERY MINUTE FOR SIGNS OF MALICIOUS INTENT LIKE FISHING OR DISTRIBUTION OF MALWARE. WE PROTECT OVER A BILLION EMAIL ACCOUNTS AND CHECK FOUR HUNDRED BILLION ANDROID DEVICES A DAY FOR MALICIOUS SOFTWARE. AGAIN HELP THE USERS OF THOSE SERVICES AND WE ENCRYPT CUSTOMER DATA AT REST AND IN TRANSIT TO HELP PROTECTED FROM UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. AND WHILE ALL THESE PROTECTIONS ARE HELPFUL. AS WE'VE HEARD BUSINESSES MUST ALSO PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE THEY KNOW THAT THEIR PEOPLE AND DATA AND BUSINESS PROCESSES THEY KNOW THIS IS THE BEST AND THEY'RE IN THE BEST POSITION TO MAKE THE INFORM SECURITY CHOICES AND DECISIONS. THE MATCH UP WITH THEIR BUSINESS NEEDS UNFORTUNATELY PROVIDERS LIKE GOOGLE OFFER VERY POWERFUL IN EASY TO USE SECURITY TOOLS TO HELP BUSINESSES DO THEIR PART. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. AND WHILE EVERY BUSINESS IS DIFFERENT FOCUSING ON THE MOST COMMON THREATS MANY OF WHICH WE'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE PROTECTIONS CAN HAVE THE MOST IMPACT. WE BELIEVE THAT SMALL BUSINESSES SHOULD TRY TO FIRST PROTECT AGAINST EMAIL BORNE THREATS WE'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THIS BEING THE MOST COMMON THREAT FACTOR. SECOND THE SHOULD STE REALLY WORK ON STRENGTHENING PROTECTION FOR THEIR HIGH VALUE USERS THEIR EXECUTIVES THERE FINANCE PERSONNEL THEIR I. T. ADMINS WITH A LOT OF CONTROL IMPACT OVER WHAT HAPPENS. IN THE BUSINESS AND I'LL WELCOME A COMPROMISE WOULD BE VERY SERIOUS. THIRD THEY NEED TO FOCUS ON WHERE THEY'RE SENSITIVE BUSINESS DAY. AND THIS MIGHT BE PERSONAL DATA ON CUSTOMERS OR EMPLOYEES IT COULD BE PAYMENT DATE IT COULD BE HEALTH DATA IT COULD BE LEGAL INFORMATION. AND PROACTIVELY LIMIT THE ON OFF THE RICE HEARING OR ACCESS OF THIS INFORMATION TO PROCESS SEES IN TECHNOLOGY. AND FINALLY AS WE HEARD VERY ELOQUENTLY IN THE LAST PRESENTATION. BUSINESSES MUST ACKNOWLEDGE AND MAKE SECURITY A BUSINESS PRIORITY THEY NEED TO HELP THEIR EMPLOYEES UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE THE FRONTLINE OF DEFENSE -- FOR THEIR BUSINESSES AND TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY SO I'D LIKE TO SPEND A LITTLE TIME ON EACH OF THESE AND DISCUSS HOW CLOUT TECHNOLOGY FOR PROVIDERS LIKE GOOGLE AND OTHERS CAN HELP. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO LET'S START WITH EMAIL BORNE THREATS AS WE'VE HEARD FISHING ATTACKS OR EMAILS THAT IMPERSONATE A TRUSTED SOURCE TO TRICK USERS INTO SHARING INFORMATION OR INSTALLING MALICIOUS SOFTWARE. IS A VERY PERVASIVE PROBLEM. AND LIKE MANY SECURITY CHALLENGES DEFENDING AGAINST PHISHING ATTACKS REQUIRES MULTIPLE LAYERS OF DEFENSE A CONCEPT OF WHAT WE CALL SECURITY DEFENSE IN DEPTH. NOW THE IDEAL DEFENSE IS STOPPING FISHING EMAILS FROM EVER REACHING A USER'S INBOX IF WE CAN DO THAT. IT'S A VERY VERY STRONG PROTECTION BUT THIS REQUIRES SMART SOFTWARE TO FILTER OUT THE DANGEROUS EMAILS BUT LET LEGITIMATE EMAILS THROUGH SO THAT THE BUSINESS IS NOT AFFECTED. STRIKING THIS BALANCE IS DIFFICULT IN EVIL PROVIDERS LIKE GOOGLE HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE IN TECHNOLOGY TO HELP. WE BLOCK MORE THAN NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF SPAM PHISHING AND MALWARE FOR ME FROM REACHING EMAIL INBOXES OF THE USE OF THE SERVICES CAN REALLY HELP. THE SMALL BUSINESSES. THE NEXT LINE OF DEFENSE IS STOPPING USES FROM CLICKING ON THESE MALICIOUS LINKS THAT WE'VE SEEN EXAMPLES OF IF AN EMAIL DOES GET THROUGH. WE OFFER A TECHNOLOGY CALLED GOOGLE SAFE BROWSING THAT WORKS ACROSS OUR PRODUCTS IN POWER SEE FOR BROWSING EXPERIENCES ACROSS THE INTERNET. GOOGLE SAFE BROWSING HELPS PROTECT OVER THREE BILLION DEVICES EVERY DAY BY SHOWING WARNINGS TO USERS WHEN THEY ATTEMPT TO NAVIGATE TO WHAT WE CONSIDER DANGEROUS SITES OR DOWNLOAD DANGEROUS FILES. WHEN YOU SEE THIS FLASHING RED WARNING GENERALLY YOU STOP RIGHT -- SAFE BROWSING ALSO NOTIFIES THE WEBMASTERS THE PEOPLE CONTROL WEB PRESENCES WHEN THEIR WEBSITES MAY BE COMPROMISED IN SO IT HELPS THEM DIAGNOSE AND RESOLVE THE PROBLEM SO THERE VISITORS TO COME TO THEIR SITES AND COMES TO THEIR BUSINESS. CAN STAY SAFER. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. IN VERY RARE INSTANCES WE'VE ALSO HEARD THE GOVERNMENT BACKED ATTACKERS MAY BE NEW TRY TO COMPROMISE USER ACCOUNTS. G. EMAIL CAN EVEN DEFECT -- DETECT THESE TYPE OF ATTACKS AND WARM BUSINESSES OF SUCH A SERIOUS SITUATION HERE WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE WOULD DO THAT -- IN OUR SOFTWARE. BACKSIDE PLEASE. WE ALSO HEARD QUITE A BIT ABOUT BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE IN G. EMAIL HAS VERY SPECIFIC PROTECTION BUILT IN AGAINST THE TACTICS WE'VE SEEN MOST COMMONLY USED IN THESE ATTACKS. SO FOR EXAMPLE HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF HOW WE WARN USERS ABOUT EMAIL THAT TRIES TO SPOOF EMPLOYEE NAMES THAT MAY BE IN THEIR DIRECTORY OR THAT COMES FROM AN ADDRESS THAT LOOKS SIMILAR TO A CUSTOMER'S OWN ADDRESS VERY SPECIFIC. PROTECTIONS THEY DEAL WITH THESE TACTICS THAT WE'RE SEEING. WE ALSO AUTOMATICALLY FLAG EMAILS FROM UNTRUSTED CENTERS THAT MAY HAVE NOT SENT EMAIL TO A USER BEFORE THAT MAY INDICATE -- MALICIOUS ACTIVITY WE SCANNED IMAGES FOR FISHING INDICATORS AND WE EXPAND SOME OF THE SHORTENED EMAIL ADDRESSES ARE YOU ARE A ARE ELSE TO UNCOVER MALICIOUS LINKS. WITH THE PROTECTIONS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE MORE THAN NINETY NINE POINT 9% OF BUSINESS EMAIL COMPROMISE SCENARIOS ARE EITHER AUTOMATICALLY MOVED TO THE SPAM FOLDER OR FLAG WITH WARNINGS TO USERS IN THIS CAN HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. IN MITIGATING THOSE TYPE OF ATTACKS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST PHISHING ATTACKS IS STOPPING ATTACKERS IF AND WHEN THEY MANAGED TO STEAL A PASSWORD. NOW SOME OF THIS CAN BE DONE BY SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR EXAMPLE GOOGLE CHALLENGES MORE THAN ONE MILLION SIGN IN ATTEMPTS EVERY DAY WE'RE AN ATTACKER HAS THE USERS PASSWORD. BUT WERE OTHER FACTORS MAY BE SUSPICIOUS OR UNEXPECTED WE ASK THEM FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BEFORE THEY LOG IN SO THE MORE WE CAN DO THE LESS BUSINESSES NEED TO DO WE CONTINUE TO ADVANCE OUR CAPABILITIES IN THIS AREA. BUT AS WE'VE HEARD FROM OTHER PANELISTS TODAY THE OTHER DEFENSE AGAINST OWN PASSWORD IS ROUTE TO REQUIRE SOMETHING ELSE IN ADDITION TO THAT USER NAME AND PASSWORD TO LOG IN. THIS IS KNOWN AS WE HEARD AS TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION OR AS AT GOOGLE WE CALL IT TWO STEP VERIFICATION. THIS SECOND STEP CAN BE SOMETHING LIKE A CODE FROM AN APPLE ON THE PHONE OR AN APP ON A PC OR CAN BE A TEXT MESSAGE THAT IS SENT WHEN THE USER ATTEMPTS TO SIGN IN. NOW WHILE THIS IS STRONGER THAN THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD ALONE SOPHISTICATED ATTACKERS HAVE FOUND WAYS TO GET AROUND SOME OF THESE TWO STEP VERIFICATION METHODS. AND USERS ALSO DON'T LIKE THE ADDITIONAL FRICTION THIS THIS CREATES IN LOGGING IN SO THEY OFTEN LOOK TO TURN THIS OFFER CIRCUMVENT IT. AT GOOGLE WE PIONEERED THE USE OF A TWO STEP VERIFICATION METHOD CALLED SECURITY KEYS VERY SIMPLE -- THAT IS HIGHLY RESISTANT TO THESE TYPE OF ATTACKS ALL THE USER HAS TO DO IS INSERT -- A HEART A SMALL HARDWARE KEY AND TAP WHEN THEY ARE ASKED TO LOG IN SO. IN THIS WEEK WE INTRODUCED A VERSION OF THIS KEY THAT IS ACTUALLY BUILT INTO MOST MODERN ANDROID PHONES THAT MAKES THIS POWERFUL TECHNOLOGY TO PROTECT ACCOUNTS AVAILABLE TO ALMOST A BILLION USERS. THERE'S A RANGE OF OPTIONS THAT CAN FIT MOST ORGANIZATIONS WE SAY THAT SECURITY KEYS ARE EASY TO DEPLOY. EASY TO USE BUT VERY HARD ON FISHER'S. IN AGAIN TWO STEP VERIFICATION IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO PUT IN PLACE FOR WHAT WE CALL HIGH VALUES THIS WILL LIKELY BE THE TARGET. OF THE SCAMS THAT IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT WE HEARD ABOUT AGAIN EXECUTIVES EMPLOYEES IN FINANCE FUNCTIONS OR IT ADMINISTRATORS. NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. THE FINAL TECHNOLOGY RECOMMENDATION THAT I WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT INVOLVED SOLUTIONS THAT CAN STOP SENSITIVE DATA FROM LEAVING AN ORGANIZATION SYSTEMS. THIS TAPE THIS TECHNOLOGY IS CALLED DATA LOSS PREVENTION OR DLP. IT CAN DETECT SENSITIVE DATA SUCH AS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS CREDIT CARD NUMBERS ACCOUNT DETAILS HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS IN OTHER PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. GOOGLE'S OWN SOLUTION -- IF FOR THIS TECHNOLOGY DETECTS MORE THAN NINETY DIFFERENT SENSITIVE DATA TYPES AUTOMATICALLY AND CAN BLOCK OR WARN USERS AND YOU CAN SEE EXAMPLES OF THIS. WHEN THAT INFORMATION IS BEING SENT OVER EMAIL OR SHARED IN A DOCUMENT? THIS POWERFUL TECHNOLOGIES BUILT INTO GOOGLE'S EMAIL AND COLLABORATION PRODUCTS. DEAL P. CAN STOP INTENTIONALLY MALICIOUS ACTIVITY SUCH AS THAT IS BEING DRIVEN BY BAD ACTORS BUT WE'RE WE SEE THE MOST VALUE -- ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES ISN'T HELPING STOP INADVERTENT DISCLOSURES OF DATA MISTAKES ARE SITUATIONS WHERE USER MIGHT NOT EVEN BE AWARE THAT THEY'RE HANDLING THIS TYPE OF DATA OR SHARING IT OUT. MANY DATA BREACHES THAT WE SEE ARE THE RESULT OF UNINTENDED -- ON INTO UNINTENTIONAL DISCLOSURE IN THIS TECHNOLOGIES PARTICULARLY USEFUL IN ADDRESSING THE SITUATIONS -- NEXT SLIDE PLEASE. SO THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS THAT THE SOLUTIONS I SPOKE ABOUT AND PRIORITIZED ARE FOCUSED ON STOPPING THREATS THAT PRIMARILY TARGET PEOPLE AND WE HEARD THIS POINT. ME VERY STRONGLY IN OUR LAST PANEL CYBER CRIMINALS KNOWS THE USERS NOT THE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE USING A TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR OFTEN THE EASIEST TARGETS. SO BUSINESSES LARGE AND SMALL NEED TO EDUCATE THEIR EMPLOYEES AND MAKE SECURITY A BUSINESS PRIORITY THEY MUST HELP UNDER USERS UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE THE FRONTLINE OF DEFENSE. FOR THEIR BUSINESS AND THEIR ACTIONS MAKE A DIFFERENCE WE CAN'T STIGMATIZE THEM AS VICTIMS WHEN BAD THINGS HAPPEN THAT'S VERY YOU KNOW A BAD PRACTICE. SO TO CONCLUDE. SMALL BUSINESS YOU SHOULD FOCUS ON ADDRESSING EMAIL BORNE THREATS. PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PROTECTION FOR THE HIGH VALUE USERS THREE TWO STEP VERIFICATION AND MINIMIZING UNINTENDED DISCLOSURE OF SENSITIVE DATA. WITH THE HELP OF AFFECTED AND POWERFUL CLOUD BASED TOOLS THAT ARE COST EFFECTIVE. EASY TO IMPLEMENTING USE SMALL BUSINESSES CAN BECOME MORE RESILIENT TO CYBER THREATS. FOCUS ON THEIR CORE BUSINESS RATHER BECOMING SECURITY EXPERTS AND PROSPER AND GROW. WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND SHARE OUR POINT OF VIEW ARE IMPORTANT TOPIC AND WE'LL HANDLE QUESTIONS AS WE DECIDE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND AND AGAIN A A GREAT PANEL AND I APPRECIATE YOU TALKING FAST BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE WERE. A LITTLE BIT. SHORT ON TIME BUT SINCE WE HAVE THE LUXURY OF A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I DO HAVE -- FOR BOTH OF YOU JUST SOME QUICK QUESTIONS A THE WHAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING SO MUCH ABOUT TO STEP OF AUTHORIZATION ON G. MAIL OR VERIFICATION AND VIA TEXT MESSAGE NOW YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT'S NOT A 100%. SECURITY MORE OF HOW IS IT THAT THE HACKERS ARE GETTING AROUND THAT. YEAH SO -- IN THE CASE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO GET AROUND SOME OF THE FORMS OF TWO STEP VERIFICATION. COMMONLY WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT IT REVIEW RELYING ON AN APP THAT IS PRESENT ON A PHONE OR SOMETHING IS SENT VIA TEXT MESSAGE AND SO IF THERE IS MALWARE ALREADY ON THE PHONE IT CAN INTERCEPT THAT CODE. AND SEND IN THAT CODE AHEAD VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THE THE ESCROW SKIM SO THEY CAN THEY CAN DO THAT AND CAPTURE THAT. WE'VE ALSO SEEN IN VERY HIGH VALUE CASES IN AGAIN WITH SOMETHING HIGH DOLLAR VALUE THINGS WITH CRYPTO CURRENCY OR THINGS AROUND ESCROW THEY WILL ACTUALLY GO TO THE PHONE COMPANY. AND ASKED TO SWAP YOUR PROBE -- IMPERSONATE A CUSTOMER AND SAY I NEED TO CHANGE OUT MY SIM CARD AND SO BY GETTING THAT SIM CARD THEY CAN ACTUALLY PUT THAT IN A NEW PHONE AND GET THOSE TEXT MESSAGES WAS RECENTLY A CASE I THINK TODAY -- THAT THE FBI BROUGHT WHERE THEY INDICTED ON NINE INDIVIDUALS AS A RESULT OF PERPETRATING SOME OF THE SIM SWAPPING SCHEMES SO -- AGAIN THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE OFFER IN TERMS OF SECURITY KEYS BECAUSE IT IS A PHYSICAL HARDWARE DEVICE AND DOES SOME -- TECHNOLOGY THAT THAT OUGHT INDICATES BOTH THE USER AGAIN THE SITE IT'S IMMUNE TO THOSE DIFFERENT TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES BUT AGAIN ANY FORM OF TWO STEP VERIFICATION IS MUCH STRONGER THAN A USER NAME AND PASSWORD ALONE AND WE SHOULDN'T DISCOURAGE. THE USE OF ANY OF THOSE FORMS. AND THE MELHAM THAT WE'RE ON THE PHONE THAT MIGHT INTERCEPT THE TEXT MESSAGE WOULD BE THAT YOU CLICK TO LINK IS SATURATED I WOULD BE -- IT COULD BE A LINK THAT WAS CLICKED FOR A USER DOWNLOADED AN APP -- FROM -- YOU KNOW A SOURCE THAT IS NOT FOR EXAMPLE -- THE YOU KNOW THE PHONE MANUFACTURERS APPS STORE WERE MOST OF THE APPS THERE ARE VETTED AND LOOKED OUT FOR SECURITY PURPOSES WE SEE THIS -- THIS PURPOSE OF AS PRACTICE OF SIDE LOADING OR BRINGING IN APPS FROM UNTRUSTED -- UNTRUSTED SOURCES AND THAT'S A THAT'S A REALLY COMMON WAY FOR MALWARE TO GET ON ADVICE OR GET ON THE PHONE OKAY WE ALWAYS ENCOURAGE USERS TO DOWNLOAD APPS ONLY FROM. THE OFFICIAL APP STORES OF THEIR PHONE MANUFACTURER -- OKAY AND THEN THE LAST THING YOU MENTIONED SECURITY PHONE I MEAN THE SECURITY KIDS FOR ANDROID PHONES. NOW FROM G. MAIL YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING FOR IPHONE -- SECURITY SO NOT NOT AT THIS POINT IN TIME BUT WE'RE ACTIVELY LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN EXTEND THIS TECHNOLOGY CONTENT THAT'S THAT'S GREAT INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE WHEN WE DO ALL OUR CYBER TALKS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE TALK ABOUT IS. MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S TWO SEVEN AUTHENTICATION BUT WE ALSO WANT TO TRY TO KEEP AHEAD OF OF SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE COMING UP. SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THEN I JUST WANTED TO ASK -- DAVID YOU HAD MENTIONED ABOUT THE THE AYE AYE. WE WERE HEARING A LOT ABOUT THE THE THE INCREDIBLE POTENTIAL OF FIVE G. BUT ALSO THE RISKS AND I I THINK THE RISKS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE SOMEWHAT LESS THAN THOSE HAVE WHO HAVE. CHOSEN TO GO WITH THE CHINESE TECHNOLOGY. BUT WHAT WHAT YOU MENTIONED THAT LEGISLATORS COULD LOOK AT A LEGISLATION ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT SPECIFICALLY IN CALIFORNIA WOULD THAT HAVE TO BE SOMETHING DONE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. I THINK IT APPLIES ACROSS THE BOARD MA'AM I THINK -- AS WE BEGIN TO ADOPT FIVE G.. I THINK TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS NEED TO BE ENCOURAGED TO FIGURE OUT HOW. TO DESIGN SECURITY ON THE FRONT END OF THAT PROCESS AS OPPOSED. TO KIND OF HOW WE'VE DONE IT FOR THREE G. AND FOUR G.. YOU KNOW FIGURING OUT HOW WE TACK ON SECURITY AFTER THE FACT RIGHT THERE I THINK THIRD I THINK WHAT POLICY MAKERS CAN HELP DO. IS DRIVE YOU KNOW A DEEPER DISCUSSION INTO HOW SECURITY IS GOING TO BE IMPACTED BY FIVE G.. NOT NECESSARILY A A SPECIFIC LEGISLATIVE FIX OR ACTION. BUT JUST PROMOTING KIND OF THE CONVERSATION THAT CONSIDER. AND AND WE HAVE OF LAST YEAR WITH OUR INTERNET OF THINGS BUILT. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT IS THAT ALL THESE FANCY GADGETS THAT WERE. YOU KNOW THAT OUR OUR OUR OUR DOOR BILLS AND ARE. YOU KNOW ALEXA THAT REALLY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE DESIGNERS ARE THINKING ABOUT SECURITY FOR SECURITY BY DESIGN AND SO -- THAT WE WE CERTAINLY BEEN PREACHING THAT PRIORITY YEAH FIFTY BILLION OUT TO DEVICES BY TWENTY TWENTY IT'S OF VERY IMPORTANT AT SOME BASIC SECURITY AND THEIR SELF. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK OUR PANELISTS ESPECIALLY ARE OUT OF TOWN PANELISTS LOVE THE THE BUG BOUNTY DISCUSSION AND AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR JOINING US -- HERE TODAY AND I'VE I KNOW PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE QUESTIONS A LOT OF THE PANELISTS ARE STILL AROUND SO I THINK -- HOPEFULLY AFTER AND THEY CAN INDIVIDUALLY ASK QUESTIONS BUT AGAIN WANT TO THANK OUR THIRD. PANEL AND ALL THE REST OF OUR SPEAKERS TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THAT IS THE END OF OUR SELECT COMMITTEE HEARING THANK YOU
