SENATOR NEWMAN WHEN YOU'RE READY PLEASE PROCEED- THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MR IT SAID THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TO YOUR HOUSE- I AM HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY TO PRESENT SB FOUR FORTY TO A BILL THAT WILL ENSURE THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN CALIFORNIA- ABLE TO SMOOTHLY TRANSITION FROM AT LARGE ELECTIONS TO DISTRICT BASED ELECTIONS WITHOUT ENCOURAGING INCURRING THE PERSPECTIVE COSTS AND DELAYS OF THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT LAWSUIT DURING THAT PROCESS. IN RECENT YEARS THE LEGISLATURE IS ENCOURAGED POLITICAL SUBDIVISIONS SUCH AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ADOPT DISTRICT BASED ELECTIONS WHILE SIMPLIFYING THE PROCESS FOR DOING SO SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE CALIFORNIA VOTING RIGHTS ACT IN TWO THOUSAND ONE TO PROMOTE GREATER REPRESENTATION IN EQUITY IN ELECTIONS. MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED OF CALIFORNIA'S ONE THOUSAND THIRTY SEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE SWITCHED FROM AT LARGE ELECTIONS TO DISTRICT BASED ELECTIONS UNDER CURRENT LAW EDUCATION CODE SECTION FIVE OH ONE NINE ALLOWS COUNTY COMMITTEES THAT OVERSEE SCHOOL DISTRICT ORGANIZATION. TO ESTABLISH TRUSTEER AREA ELECTIONS IN A PROMPT AND INCLUSIVE PROCESS UNFORTUNATELY FOR REASONS HAVING TO DO WITH HOUSE AREA STATE STATUTES AND CODES INTERSECT THE CURRENT CODE MAKES AN EXCEPTION FOR SCHOOL AND COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS THAT ARE GOVERNED BY THE CHARTER OF THE CITY. OR A COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS DURING THIS DESCRIPTION ARE STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO PUT ANY ORDINANCE AND ESTABLISHING TRUSTEE AREA ELECTIONS TO THE ELECTORS IN THE DISTRICT WHICH OFTEN RESULTS IN AN OFFICIAL ELECTION AND SOMETIMES AN OFF CYCLE ELECTION AT SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSE TO THE LOCALITY. IN PRACTICE AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTE SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN BYPASS THIS REQUIREMENT BY SECURING A WAIVER FROM THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION THIS EXTRA STEP HOWEVER STILL LEADS TIME AN ADDITIONAL COST OF THE ADOPTION OF TRUST YEAR ELECTIONS AND THIS DELAY HAS RESULTED IN FURTHER AT LARGE ELECTIONS THAT ARE TECHNICALLY IN VIOLATION. OF THE CVR ACT THESE UNNECESSARY COMPLEXITIES CAN RIP CAN RESULT IN COSTLY LITIGATION AS WELL AS SUBSEQUENT UNLAWFUL AT LARGE ELECTIONS THAT PERPETUATE THE DILUTION OF MINORITY VOTES IN VIOLATION OF EITHER THE SPIRIT OR THE LETTER OF THE CVR RIGHT AS AN EXAMPLE JUST YESTERDAY THE SENATE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE ON WHICH I SIT HEARD ASSEMBLY EDGE CHAU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAO'S AB THROUGH FORTY WHICH WOULD AUTHORIZE THE CITY OF ALHAMBRA. TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL OF A SPECIAL ELECTION TO REMOVE FROM THE CITY'S CHARTER. ALL REFERENCES TO THE ALHAMBRA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THEREBY SOLVING THE SAME PROBLEM THROUGH VERY DIFFERENT MEANS SB FOUR FORTY TWO FIXES THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM. BY ALLOWING ORDINANCES APPROVING A PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH TRUSTEE AREAS. TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY UPON ADOPTION WITHOUT THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL ELECTION. TO AFFIRM APPROVAL UNDER THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL THIS WOULD APPLY TO ALL ELECTIONS FOR GOVERNING BOARD MEMBERS. MORE THAN A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DAYS FOLLOWING ITS ADOPTION. WITH THESE CHANGES AS BEFORE FOR TWO WILL STREAMLINE THE TRANSITION PROCESS WILL ELIMINATING ADDITIONAL COSTS. TO TAXPAYERS RESULTING FROM DELAYS IN PERSPECTIVE LITIGATION THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION.

THE NEXT A PROGRAM IS IN PLACE IN FORTY FIVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES ANNUALLY SERVING TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED CURRENT AND FORMER FOSTER YOUTHS. CURRENTLY TO QUALIFY FOR THIS PROGRAM STUDENTS MUST HAVE BEEN IN FOSTER CARE AFTER THE AGE OF SIXTEEN. BE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX AND BE ENROLLED IN A MINIMUM OF NINE ACADEMIC UNITS. WELL THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE FOR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH RETENTION DEGREE COMPLETION RATES. THE% CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE FOUND IN A REPORT. THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL BARRIERS PREVENTING MANY OF THESE WONDERFUL STUDENTS FROM PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM. TO ADDRESS THESE BARRIERS SB FIVE TWELVE SIX TO DO THE FOLLOWING. FIRST MODIFY THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE PROGRAM OUT ENABLE STUDENTS WHO ARE IN FOSTER CARE AFTER THE AGE OF THIRTEEN TO PARTICIPATE. SECOND CREATE FLEXIBILITY AROUND INCOME REQUIREMENTS FOR STUDENTS TRANSITIONING FROM FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT TO SCHOOL. THIRDS SPECIFYING THAT EXISTING FUNDS CAN BE USED TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO ENROLLED STUDENTS AS IF THEY ARE AS THEY ARE MATRICULATING.

BY INCLUDING STUDENTS WHO ARE IN FOSTER CARE ON OR AFTER THEIR THIRTEENTH BIRTHDAY. ALIGNING WITH THE SAME AGE THRESHOLD USED TO DETERMINE INDEPENDENT STATUS WITHIN FASTER. SB FIVE TWELVE ALLOW US TO BETTER SERVE MORE OF THIS VULNERABLE POPULATION OF STUDENTS AN ADDITIONAL ELEVEN HUNDRED OF THEM WOULD BE SERVED BY THE NEXT UP PROGRAM.

PATH PAST DISEASE AND CONTAMINANTS THAT THREATENED PLANTS AND ANIMALS. BRENT THE INTEGRITY RELIABILITY SUSTAINABILITY AND PROVIDED FOR BOTTOM PROBABILITY OF OUR FOOD SYSTEMS. LEFT UNCHECKED THEY CAN ALSO THREATEN OUR OWN HEALTH. ONE HEALTH IS AN APPROACH TO HEALTH CARE THAT RECOGNIZES THAT THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IS CLOSELY LINKED TO THE HEALTH OF ANIMALS AND OF OUR SHARED ENVIRONMENT THE CDC ESTIMATES THAT THREE OUT OF FOUR EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND PEOPLE COME FROM ANIMALS. CURRENTLY THERE ARE ONE POINT SIX MILLION UNDISCOVERED VIRUSES CIRCULATING IN THE ANIMAL POPULATION. AND AT LEAST HALF OF WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SPREAD TO HUMANS. SB FOUR FIVE THREE PUTS CALIFORNIA AND THE CSU SYSTEM AT THE FOREFRONT OF RESEARCH ON BIO SECURITY. IN DOING SO LAYS THE GROUNDWORK TO BETTER PROTECT OUR STATE AND THE NATION FROM IMPACTS TO OUR FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN AND RECOGNIZES THE LINK BETWEEN THE HEALTH OF OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR OWN HEALTH.

WHY WHY RE FORCED TO SHUT DOWN OUR ENTIRE ECONOMY FURTHER DOCTOR MEETING AFTER TO HELP YOUR BY LOSS OF JOBS AND HEALTH CARE INSURANCE WHY.

THANK YOU CHAIR AND- SENATOR WITHOUT TONE THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT BILL IN LIGHT OFF ALL- TERRIBLE RECORDED NINETEEN- WE HAVE- EXPERIENCE INDUSTRIAL LAW- NOT COMPLETELY- OUT OF- NO CONTROL- UNDER CONTROL- SO YOU STYLE BREACHING BIOSECURITY AND THE AND MERGING. INFECTIONS INFECTIOUS DISEASE OF FUND IS- EXCELLENT IDEA- SO THAT WE- DO A SERIOUS RESEARCH AND TO PREVENT ANY- SUCH. INFECTION THAT WE- ARE UNDER- THE PRESIDENT THROUGH THE NOT GOING ON AND- OF BEING AFFECTED- SO IN THAT- THIS IS- ENCOURAGING- NOT ONLY UP NOW FEDERAL FUNDED WHAT THE LOCAL AND A PRIVATE FUNDS SO ONCE THAT OF- OUR SYSTEM IS ESTABLISHED OF A I'M SURE THERE WILL BE- GREAT TO SUPPORT ALL OF. THIS OF A FUNDA. AND THE CSU- IS- WHAT I'M READING MOSTLY- CSU SYSTEM SO. BUT I WONDER WHAT THE I'M ALL FOR LOOKING OR NOT- UC SYSTEM YES- NOT TO MENTION THAT HERE. WAS THERE ANY REASON WHY IS WAS THE- ANY SEPARATE STUFF- OF FUNDING MECHANISM SET UP FOR UC'S CENTER THIS IS THE FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR ME CSU SYSTEMS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND IF I MAY ADD TO THE CHAIR. YES UP TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION OF WHY NOT UC AND CSU AND REALLY IT'S ABOUT EQUITY ACTUALLY UC DAVIS ALREADY HAS- BIOSECURITY RESEARCH THAT THEY DO THAT THE FOCUS ON WILDLIFE- FROM MY UNDERSTANDING. OF THE REASON WHY THERE IS A FOCUS ON ON AND AGRICULTURE AND AGRICULTURAL REGIONS AND ALSO- THE CSU THAT ARE FOCUSED OR THAT ARE STE YOU KNOW- IN THOSE REGIONS. IS BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF WORD INFECTIOUS DISEASES COME FROM. AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF. DON'T LIKE IT I BELIEVE UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW KALRA NINETEEN CAME ABOUT I MEAN IT THERE'S AN UNDERSTANDING THAT IT CAME FROM- FROM AN ANIMAL RIGHT AND SO. WE REALLY GOT A LOOK AT THOSE THOSE COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDE AN EQUITABLE OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS AND THOSE COMMUNITIES TO DO RESEARCH ABOUT WHAT IMPACTS THEM AS WELL AND SO IT'S REALLY MORE OF AN EQUITY ISSUE- NOT SO MUCH OF. YOU KNOW LEAVING AT A PARTICULAR A SYSTEM OUT- I THINK THIS WILL BRING A BALANCED APPROACH TO OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND REALLY- WHAT THE CLIMATE CHANGING WORLD IT NEEDS TO BE KIND OF AN LL HANDS ON DECK WHEN IT COMES TO SOLUTIONS AND TO REALLY HAVE A TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF DISEASES- SUCH AS THAT YOU KNOW THE EXAMPLE WAS GIVEN EARLIER ON VALLEY FEVER BY DOCTOR BAINES. VALLEY FEVER FOR THE MOST PART HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN SPECIFIC TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY HOW DO WE KNOW THAT THE YOUR VALLEY FEVER MAY NOT BE YOU KNOW MAY NOT BE THE NEXT PANDEMIC HERE IN THE UNITED STATES WELL WE GOT A STUDY THAT RIGHT WE GOTTA MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE INVESTED IN AND WE HAVE A DEDICATED CENTER AND RESEARCH TO THAT- AND NOBODY'S GOING TO KNOW IT BETTER THAN PEOPLE THAT ARE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. THIRTY EIGHT SPECIFIC BUT IT'S ALSO LIKE I SAID IT'S AN EQUITY- IT'S ABOUT HAVING A- THAT EQUITY THROUGHOUT THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND RESEARCH. THANK YOU DR WEBER. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS- FOR THIS BILL AND I'M JUST ASING FOR A POINT OF CLARIFICATION BECAUSE I HAD. ASKED MY STAFF WITH THEM A QUESTION ABOUT THIS BILL IN TERMS OF WHICH SCHOOLS WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR FINDING CELL ARE YOU STATING THAT IT'S ONLY SEE ISSUES WITHIN A CERTAIN REGION. SO IT'S AT THE C. ISSUES THAT ARE WITHIN THE AGRICULTURAL INSTITUTE. OR UNDER THE- AGRICULTURAL THE CSU AGRICULTURAL INSTITUTE WITH MULTIPLE CAMPUSES I THINK THERE'S ABOUT. US SIX OF THEM. DEFENDER I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER OF WHAT PARTICULAR C. ISSUES- BUT I CAN'T BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO YOU. AND THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT THE CSU CURRENTLY HAS AS- WITHIN THAT A PARTICULAR INSTITUTE. I THINK SENATOR TRIAL MY STAFF WILL GIVE YOU THE LIST THERE AND DR WEBBER. ON BESIDES THE LISTS THAT SENATOR TYLENOL HAS- THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL C. ISSUES ADDED. YOU CAN WOULD YOU WANT TO SHARE THE LIST YES OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE INSTITUTE- HAS IT INCLUDES- CAL STATE UNIVERSITY CHICO CAL STATE UNIVERSITY FRESNO CAT CAL STEEP THE POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY POMONA SELES OBISPO AND HUMBLE. AND MONTEREY BAY AND OTHERS SEE ISSUES IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING COULD BE ADDED. I TO THAT ASSOCIATION OR TO THAT- UMBRELLA GROUP THAT IS CORRECT I MEAN THIS IS A BILL THAT'S GONNA GET SOMETHING GOING AND- WITHIN THE CSU- BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S GOING TO EXCLUDE OTHER CAMPUSES EIGHT THERE'S A POSSIBILITY TO HAVE ADDITIONAL CSU CAMPUSES INCLUDED WITHIN THIS. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT POSSIBILITY BECAUSE LIKE YOU SAID WE WANT- THE BEST RESEARCH WE WANT THESE THINGS DISCOVERED QUICKLY. AND EVEN IF IT MEANS THAT IT HAPPENS TO BE IN AN AREA THAT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE ORIGIN. RIGHT WE'VE GOT EBOLA AND BUT WE'RE STARTING AT AROUND THE WORLD NOT NECESSARILY JUST IN THE HOT SPOT- YOU KNOW WE DIDN'T GET THROUGH OR NOT GETTING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC BY JUST FOCUSING ON EVERYTHING AND TRYING TO THE TECHNOLOGY FOR COVERT OR SARS TO SOUTH. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THAT WE DON'T JUST LIMIT OUR POSSIBILITY. COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND EQUITY- BUT WE SHOULD ALSO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE. ALLOWING FOR- THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST TO COME OUT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO SO THAT WE DON'T GO THROUGH SOMETHING LIKE THIS AGAIN SO THANK YOU THANK YOU ANDI WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH YOU AND THAT'S PART OF THE REASON THE PURPOSE OF THIS.

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER COMMENTS IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHT OH TWO AND THE RE AUTHORIZATION OF THE BUREAU FOR PRIVATE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION. THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS HAD A LASTING AND IN EQUITABLE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S LABOR MARKET WHICH UNFORTUNATELY COMES ON THE HEELS OF A LONG PERIOD OF DE REGULATION OF FOR PROFIT SCHOOLS UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. FOLLOWING THE GREAT RECESSION THE OVERLAP OF AN ECONOMIC CRISIS AND THE LACKS POSTSECONDARY REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT LED TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ENROLLMENT AT FOR PROFIT COLLEGES AS PREDATORY PROGRAMS TARGETED VULNERABLE AND HISTORICALLY DISADVANTAGED INDIVIDUALS. WITH AGGRESSIVE RECRUITING EFFORTS. WORRYINGLY WE ARE SEEING SIMILAR TRENDS IN CALIFORNIA TODAY MAKING THE BUREAU'S WORK MORE ESSENTIAL THAN EVER AS THE STATE RECOVERS FROM THE PANDEMIC. A WELL FUNCTIONING BUREAU IS VITAL TO ENSURING STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO EQUITABLE QUALITY EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA. TKS AND THIRTEEN OTHER PARTNERS RECENTLY SUBMITTED COMMENTS IN SUPPORT OF SB EIGHT OH TWO AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD FURTHER STRENGTHEN BUREAU FUNCTION WHICH WE HOPE TO SEE INCORPORATED INTO THE BILL INCLUDING. ONE BY EMPOWERING THE BUREAU TO CREATE MINIMUM OPERATING STANDARDS TO EVALUATE INSTITUTIONS. TO BY EVALUATING THE BY ENABLING THE BUREAU TO COLLECT BETTER DATA TO INFORM THOSE STANDARDS. THREE BY CREATING SURETY BOND REQUIREMENT TO COVER THE COST OF UNEXPECTED SCHOOL CLOSURES AND FOR BY GIVING THE BUREAU MORE DISCRETION ON INSTITUTIONAL APPROVAL. HOWEVER THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO ENSURE THE CONTINUATION OF A SUFFICIENTLY FUNDED STABLE BUREAU WITH THE CAPACITY AND AT THE WORD HE NEEDED TO PROTECT STUDENTS. THE BUREAU MUST BE RE AUTHORIZED IN THE SUNSET DATE SHOULD BE EXTENDED FOR A FULL-TERM OF AT LEAST FIVE YEARS TO ALLOW THE BUREAU THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS ON ITS PRIMARY CHARGE. OF CONSUMER PROTECTION. WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND HOPE TO SEE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS INCORPORATED MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER SUPPORT. THANK YOU.
