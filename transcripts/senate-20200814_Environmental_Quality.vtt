COUPLE CONCERNS EVERYONE IS

00:22:13.198 --> 00:22:15.133
THAT OBVIOUSLY THIS WILL MOVE

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:16.101
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE HAVE

00:22:16.168 --> 00:22:17.436
NO OPPOSITION ON THE BILL AND I

00:22:17.502 --> 00:22:19.171
THINK WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET.

00:22:19.237 --> 00:22:20.706
TO A PLACE WHERE. YOU GOOD

00:22:20.772 --> 00:22:23.308
SOUND RECYCLING WE HAVE NON

00:22:23.375 --> 00:22:25.944
CONTAMINATED THE PROBLEM WITH.

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:27.345
RECYCLING IS YOU HAVE TO.

00:22:27.412 --> 00:22:28.480
PACIFY IT SO IT'S NOT

00:22:28.547 --> 00:22:33.585
CONTAMINATED YOU CAN REUSE. IT

00:22:33.652 --> 00:22:34.152
INTO AN APPROPRIATE MANNER.

00:22:34.219 --> 00:22:35.253
WITH THAT BEING SAID WE IN

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.089
RECENT THE INFORMATION I HAVE

00:22:37.155 --> 00:22:38.256
YOU KNOW WE'VE SEEN MANY

00:22:38.323 --> 00:22:39.691
COUNTRIES THAT ARE NOT TAKING

00:22:39.758 --> 00:22:41.393
OURS WASTE BECAUSE IT'S

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.097
CONTAMINATED THEY CAN'T REALLY

00:22:45.163 --> 00:22:45.664
YOU RIGHT LIKE THEY WANT SO

00:22:45.731 --> 00:22:46.231
THAT THERE'S A IT'S A GLOBAL

00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:48.066
PROBLEMS SOMETHING THAT. MAIN

00:22:48.133 --> 00:22:49.835
TO CALIFORNIA EVEN THOUGH WE

00:22:49.901 --> 00:22:53.538
ARE. FOCUSING ON. YOU KNOW 10%

00:22:53.605 --> 00:22:57.442
BY TWENTY TWENTY TO. 25% BY

00:22:57.509 --> 00:22:58.744
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND THEN.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.579
FIFTY BUT I THINK IT'S 50% BY.

00:23:00.645 --> 00:23:04.116
BY TWENTY THIRTY. SO I THINK

00:23:04.182 --> 00:23:05.751
THE CHALLENGE HERE IS TO

00:23:05.817 --> 00:23:07.419
DETERMINE WHAT IS THAT WHAT'S

00:23:07.486 --> 00:23:09.221
THE AMOUNT WELL I MEAN WE DON'T

00:23:09.287 --> 00:23:11.156
REALLY KNOW BECAUSE WE WE'VE

00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:13.358
BEEN THROWING IT ALL INTO ONE

00:23:13.425 --> 00:23:17.295
GIANT RECYCLING. OF BIN I GUESS

00:23:17.362 --> 00:23:18.063
AND THEN WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:19.631
OUT WHAT IS THAT QUALITY THAT

00:23:19.698 --> 00:23:22.901
IS AVAILABLE TO. RE USE IN A

00:23:22.968 --> 00:23:25.904
SAFE MANNER- AND I THINK THAT'S

00:23:25.971 --> 00:23:27.806
THE GOAL HERE SO. FOR ME I'M

00:23:27.873 --> 00:23:30.876
I'M- I'M THINKING THAT YOU KNOW

00:23:30.942 --> 00:23:32.310
WE'RE WE'RE MOVING RIGHT ALONG

00:23:32.377 --> 00:23:32.978
RIGHT PASSED WE GOT TO

00:23:33.044 --> 00:23:34.179
DETERMINE THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:36.414
GOING TO HOLD THESE. COMPANIES

00:23:36.481 --> 00:23:37.949
ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE

00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:40.018
PERCENTAGES AND MAYBE THAT

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:41.887
AMOUNT IS NOT AVAILABLE. OR

00:23:41.953 --> 00:23:43.688
MAYBE IT IS WE DON'T KNOW MAYBE

00:23:43.755 --> 00:23:45.457
THERE ARE SOME TECHNOLOGY OUT

00:23:45.524 --> 00:23:46.291
THERE SO I GUESS. THERE THE

00:23:46.358 --> 00:23:48.326
CONVERSATION IS I IN THIS IS

00:23:48.393 --> 00:23:49.194
TOO BAD THAT THE AUTHORSNOT

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY. TO

00:23:53.799 --> 00:23:56.168
OUR HALLWAY OFF THE BILL- AND

00:23:56.234 --> 00:23:57.602
SEE WHAT HAPPENS IN APPROACH

00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:59.104

00:23:59.171 --> 00:23:59.938
GET SOME ANSWERS BETWEEN NOW

00:24:00.005 --> 00:24:03.208
AND APPROPRIATIONS. ON YOU KNOW

00:24:03.275 --> 00:24:04.409
HOW WE MOVE FORWARD. BECAUSE

00:24:04.476 --> 00:24:06.611
THAT'S THE KEY IS THAT IF WE

00:24:06.678 --> 00:24:08.780
CAN'T FIND THE MATERIAL. MORGAN

00:24:08.847 --> 00:24:10.782
WE HOLD THESE. THESE WE WANT TO

00:24:10.849 --> 00:24:11.883
FIRST OF ALL THE GOAL IS TO

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:13.185
RECYCLE BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT A

00:24:13.251 --> 00:24:16.521
SAFE MANNER SO. I KIND OF I

00:24:16.588 --> 00:24:17.355
JUST WENT THROUGH HERE AND TRY

00:24:17.422 --> 00:24:19.391

THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY DID

00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:02.367
RAISE. SUCH ACTION TO CENTER

WHITE HOUSE HE'S BILL AND I

00:25:04.269 --> 00:25:05.570

COUNTRY YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:25:12.043 --> 00:25:13.845
SO CALIFORNIA BEVERAGE

00:25:13.912 --> 00:25:16.348
CONTAINERS ARE SEGREGATED FROM

00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:17.883
THE REST OF PLASTIC AND THEY GO

00:25:17.949 --> 00:25:20.285

OTHER THING IS SOME PEOPLE HAVE

00:46:50.641 --> 00:46:52.910

00:47:31.381 --> 00:47:34.785
THE COLLABORATIVES ARE AT THAT.

00:47:34.851 --> 00:47:35.852
POINT WHERE THEY CAN IMPLEMENT

00:47:35.919 --> 00:47:37.588
SOME THINGS AND THEY WANT TO

AND THAT'S GOING TO BE. PART OF

00:47:42.893 --> 00:47:43.927
THE BUDGET PROCESS WHEN THEY

00:47:43.994 --> 00:47:45.829

00:47:45.896 --> 00:47:48.031
YOU GONNA DO I MEAN. BY WILL.

00:47:48.098 --> 00:47:50.968
RECALL FOR. THE GOOD SENATOR

00:47:51.034 --> 00:47:53.537
SHOULD RECALL. THE PARIS

00:47:53.604 --> 00:47:55.872
CLIMATE CONFERENCE IN TWENTY

00:47:55.939 --> 00:47:56.707
FIFTEEN WHICH WAS FIVE YEARS

00:47:56.773 --> 00:47:58.375
AGO AT THAT TIME THE WORLD

00:47:58.442 --> 00:48:01.111
COMMITTED SEVENTY PER. 17% OF

00:48:01.178 --> 00:48:02.546
THEIR DOLLARS THE CLIMATE

00:48:02.613 --> 00:48:05.482
ADAPTATION. YEAH WE PUT A 100%

00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:07.351
INTIMIDATION SO WE'RE A LITTLE

00:48:07.417 --> 00:48:09.853
BIT. NO WE'VE GOTTEN DRIBBLES

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.421
AND TRAVELS OF IT SO THIS IS A

00:48:11.488 --> 00:48:13.657
FORMALIZATION OF THAT. I DON'T

00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:14.691
THINK WE'RE GONNA GET TO

00:48:14.758 --> 00:48:15.826
SEVENTEEN PERCENT- YOU KNOW IT

00:48:15.892 --> 00:48:18.095
BUT THAT'S- BUT THAT'S- SEEMS

00:48:18.161 --> 00:48:19.296
TO BE WHAT THE GOAL IS AND I

00:48:19.363 --> 00:48:20.197
WOULD IMAGINE SOME OF THE

00:48:20.264 --> 00:48:22.065
ADVOCATES WOULD SAY. MAKE IT

00:48:22.132 --> 00:48:24.001
HAPPEN GIVE A 70% OF CAP AND

00:48:24.067 --> 00:48:25.802
TRADE FOR. CLIMATE ADAPTATION

00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:27.537
TO BE GREAT SO THAT'S I THINK

00:48:27.604 --> 00:48:32.309
THAT'S THE FIRST. IMMEDIATE

00:48:32.376 --> 00:48:33.977
MACINNES SAID AND BEING ABLE

00:48:34.044 --> 00:48:35.345
TO. IDEAS INTEGRATED REGIONAL

00:48:35.412 --> 00:48:37.381
PROPOSALS THAN TO HAVE THE

00:48:37.447 --> 00:48:39.650
STATE DO SOME BACKSTOPPING AT

00:48:39.716 --> 00:48:40.984
LEAST GET SOME SOMETHING MOVING

00:48:41.051 --> 00:48:42.452

00:48:42.519 --> 00:48:44.421
COUNTIES ARE NOW STEPPING UP

00:48:44.488 --> 00:48:45.555
TO. TAX THEMSELVES ARE TRYING

00:48:45.622 --> 00:48:48.692
TO BOND THEMSELVES. BUT JUST

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:49.293
ASSUME THAT ALL THIS CAN BE

00:48:49.359 --> 00:48:51.028
SOLVED THE LOCAL LEVEL I THINK

00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:52.963
MISSES THE- MISSES THE MARK ON

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:54.698
THE SALE OF THE PROBLEM SO. I'M

00:48:54.765 --> 00:48:57.467

THE DOWNWARD TRAJECTORY ON OUR

01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:10.512
GREATER CAPACITY. LESSER CARBON

01:24:10.578 --> 01:24:11.713

WE HAVE LEGITIMATELY BEEN VERY

01:33:47.655 --> 01:33:49.357
FOCUSED ON THE PANDEMIC THAT WE

01:33:49.423 --> 01:33:51.525
ARE EXPERIENCING AN ECONOMIC

01:33:51.592 --> 01:33:56.263
DOWNTURN AS A RESULT OF THAT

01:33:56.330 --> 01:34:01.435
AND TO MAKE. HOWEVER IT IS.

01:34:01.502 --> 01:34:04.271
BIGGEST CHALLENGE TO OT ONLY

01:34:04.338 --> 01:34:06.841

THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND IRATE

01:34:13.514 --> 01:34:17.852
WHILE. THE VARIOUS THINGS THAT

01:34:17.918 --> 01:34:22.256

HAVE MULTIPLE SOCKS. IT IS

01:34:26.027 --> 01:34:28.529
IMPERATIVE. ABSOLUTELY

01:34:28.596 --> 01:34:30.898
IMPERATIVE WE HAVE LOST SO MUCH

01:34:30.965 --> 01:34:34.301
GROUND AND WE'RE AT THE POINT

01:34:34.368 --> 01:34:36.670
NOW WHERE THE ICE SHEETS IN

01:34:36.737 --> 01:34:39.306
GREENLAND ARE PAST THE POINT OF

01:34:45.479 --> 01:34:48.215
TO RESTORE THE ICE ON GREENLAND

01:34:48.282 --> 01:34:51.285
WE CANNOT GET TO THAT POINT. IN

01:34:51.352 --> 01:34:51.986
EITHER OF OUR POLLS IN

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:53.754
ANTARCTICA OR THE NORTH POLE

01:34:53.821 --> 01:34:55.790
YOU CAN NOT AFFORD TO GET TO

01:34:55.856 --> 01:34:57.224
THAT POINT. AND WE ARE

01:34:57.291 --> 01:35:00.995
DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THAT POINT

01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:04.131
SO. WELL THIS BILL ALONE WILL

01:35:04.198 --> 01:35:06.767

01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:35.923
CHALLENGE THE- IN A FISH THAT

01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:37.591
WE'VE WE'VE OUT TO IT SO THAT

01:36:37.658 --> 01:36:40.327
THAT ARE IN THAT PROGRAM RUNS

01:36:40.394 --> 01:36:44.999
BY CODIFY. THE NEW. TO I'M

01:36:45.065 --> 01:36:47.368
NEUTRAL IT LET THE AIRPORT OFF

01:36:47.434 --> 01:36:49.303
THE HOOK THAT THEY HAVE TO.

01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:51.005
THAT IN A FEW IN AN ATTIC THAT

01:36:51.071 --> 01:36:51.572
THEY HAVE WITH THE CURRENCY

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:53.040

THAT. AT THAT CONCERNS ME I

01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:09.390
DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE AIRPORT

SHOULD BE THE FINAL SAY ON CRAP

01:37:12.359 --> 01:37:15.329

THE BOARD SHOULD HAVE SOMETHING

01:37:42.690 --> 01:37:45.326
TO DO ON THAT WORK LAND. BUT WE

01:37:45.392 --> 01:37:48.829

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:21.161
INVENTORIES THAT WERE YOU'RE

01:38:21.228 --> 01:38:23.330

BESIDES A CAP AND TRADE X.

01:38:36.043 --> 01:38:40.114
AMENDMENT SHOULD BE REQUIRED

01:38:40.180 --> 01:38:42.716
THAT CARVE DEVELOP. INTO EIGHT.

01:38:42.783 --> 01:38:46.253
THROUGH RULE MAKING AS THAT ARE

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:47.121
TO THEM OFFICIALLY PART OF THE

01:38:47.187 --> 01:38:49.023

THEY CHANGED THAT RULE MAKING

01:39:02.269 --> 01:39:05.072
ANALYSIS AMENDMENT WOULD ALSO

01:39:05.139 --> 01:39:07.708
BE NEEDED. THAT ANY DECISION TO

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:09.810
USE NATURAL WORKING LANDS IN

01:39:09.877 --> 01:39:11.445
THE SCOPING PLAN WILL ACCOUNT

01:39:11.512 --> 01:39:13.414
FOR BOTH SEQUESTRATION AND

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:15.049
EMISSIONS SO RIGHT NOW WE HAVE

01:39:15.115 --> 01:39:16.617

AYE. I DON'T SEE HOW THIS FITS

01:43:32.906 --> 01:43:34.608
IN THE COVE IT AT ALL I THINK

01:43:34.675 --> 01:43:36.610
THIS NEEDS A LOT MORE DEBATE. A

01:43:36.677 --> 01:43:38.812
LOT MORE TO DEBATE FROM.

01:43:38.879 --> 01:43:40.814
PARTIES AT THE TABLE AND I'M

01:43:40.881 --> 01:43:44.384
SAYING IS THE WAY THERE'S A LOT

01:43:44.451 --> 01:43:46.186
OF ROOM TO GROW HERE I THINK WE

01:43:46.253 --> 01:43:48.488
I THINK WE NEED. ABOUT HOW HE

01:43:48.555 --> 01:43:50.524
MANAGED WELLS. BUT WHO DOES

01:43:50.591 --> 01:43:52.426
THAT IS TO ME IN MY MIND IS NOT

01:43:52.492 --> 01:43:55.162
THE AIRPORT. THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:43:55.228 --> 01:43:56.597
THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD NAG THE

01:43:56.663 --> 01:44:00.467
TABLE THERE NEEDS TO BE FARM

01:44:00.534 --> 01:44:02.269
THREE PEOPLE ALL TABLE BUT JUST

01:44:02.336 --> 01:44:04.171
A- PUSHING DOWN ON I'VE BEEN.

01:44:04.237 --> 01:44:06.640
ON THE END OF RISK. A LOT OF

01:44:06.707 --> 01:44:08.875
WHAT I WOULD SAY BAD POLICIES I

01:44:08.942 --> 01:44:10.911
PUSH BACK FOR YEARS. HONOR

01:44:10.978 --> 01:44:13.447
FORESTRY PRACTICES. ON HOW WE

01:44:13.513 --> 01:44:14.514
DO CARBON SEQUESTRATION THE

01:44:14.581 --> 01:44:18.585
FORCED. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT

01:44:18.652 --> 01:44:19.186
OF CALCULATIONS HERE THE NEED

01:44:19.252 --> 01:44:20.487
TO TAKE PLACE. ABOUT THE AMOUNT

01:44:20.554 --> 01:44:24.157
OF CARBON OR THE- MEAN. THERE'S

01:44:24.224 --> 01:44:26.159
OVER 50% OF THE ROOT BASE OF A

01:44:26.226 --> 01:44:27.628
TREE IS IN THE GROUND WHICH IS

01:44:27.694 --> 01:44:28.528
THE QUESTION CAR ONCE GROWING

01:44:28.595 --> 01:44:31.665
BUT WE WANT TO HARVEST THAT TOP

01:44:31.732 --> 01:44:32.466

01:44:32.532 --> 01:44:34.001
OTHERWISE THERE'S A LOT TO BE

01:44:34.067 --> 01:44:36.637
TALKED ABOUT IN THIS POSITION

01:44:36.703 --> 01:44:37.170
THOSE REASONS. I THINK WE

01:44:37.237 --> 01:44:40.440
SHOULD. WE'LL DO IT RIGHT

01:44:40.507 --> 01:44:41.074
THERE'S NO URGENCY TO MOVE THIS

01:44:41.141 --> 01:44:44.077
BILL. FORWARD AND DO IT WRONG

01:44:44.144 --> 01:44:44.978
AND WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THE

01:44:45.045 --> 01:44:46.113
POWER TO THE WRONG AGENCY MY

01:44:46.179 --> 01:44:48.649
MIND AND I SEE THE PEOPLE WHO

01:44:48.715 --> 01:44:50.283
ARE THE STAKEHOLDERS. THE

01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:51.451
GENERATIONS OF THE FAMILY

MEMBERS LIKE MYSELF. ARE IN

01:44:53.553 --> 01:44:55.355
OPPOSITION THIS BECAUSE WE NEED

TO TAKE OUR TIME AND DO IT

01:44:57.391 --> 01:44:57.891
RIGHT SO FOR THOSE IS I NOT

GONNA BE BORING THE BILL TODAY.

01:45:00.394 --> 01:45:02.229

01:45:03.563 --> 01:45:05.432

01:48:13.320 --> 01:48:16.523
IS ACTUALLY THE FUTURE OF

01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:18.358
PROSPERITY IN CALIFORNIA

01:48:18.425 --> 01:48:21.394

DISAPPOINTED I WILL SAY IN THE

01:48:24.764 --> 01:48:26.533
ANXIETY FROM THE OPPOSITION

CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE I THINK

01:48:40.747 --> 01:48:41.581
IT'S COMPLETELY

01:48:41.648 --> 01:48:42.649
