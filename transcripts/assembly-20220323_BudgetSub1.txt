AND I'LL START OFF BY WALKING THROUGH. OUR PROPOSED BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS AND SO WE HAVE THREE BEFORE YOU- THE FIRST BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL IS A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT TO. ADDRESS STAFFING- ISSUES OF DEFICIENCIES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT- AS YOU KNOW CA HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY SMALL DEPARTMENT OF LESS THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY- STAFF MEMBERS- AS SOON AS I MENTIONED WE'VE BEEN GROWING AT. FIVE QUICKLY AND HAVE JUST REACHED OUR TWO HUNDRED STAFF MEMBER. AT BEGINNING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THE DEPARTMENT RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL STAFF. IN ORDER TO HELP. IMPLEMENT DEVELOP- THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING AND IF IT FELL ITS CORE OBJECTIVES AND GOALS- PRIOR TO REQUESTING ADDITIONAL FUNDING OR FISCAL STAFF DID DO AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EXISTING DEPARTMENTAL FUNDING LEVELS. DETERMINE IF EXISTING RESOURCES COULD BE DIRECTED REDIRECTED TO PROVIDE FOR THE ADDITIONAL STUFF THAT WE NEED- AND- IN PARTICULAR THE STRATEGY THAT THEY LOOKED AT IT IS. REDUCING OUR RELIANCE ON TEMPORARY HELP POSITIONS ON THE DEPARTMENT HISTORICALLY. I HAD A HEAVY RELIANCE ON TEMPORARY HELP. WE SCALED BACK THOSE POSITIONS AND I CREATED THE FUNDING THAT WE- NEED TO. ESTABLISH PERMANENT POSITIONS I REQUEST. THAT IN THIS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL. I'M I'M ABOUT SECOND- BUT CHANGE FOR. WHICH IS YOUR ADDRESS MINISTER WORKLOAD- WITH THE OF THE GOT MASTER PLAN FOR A AS WELL AS OUR NEW HD S. M. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE BUDGET ACT INCLUDED FIFTY THREE NEW PERMANENT POSITIONS- FORCE% DEVIATE EMPLOYMENT THE MPA AND H. C. B. S. INITIATIVES- IT IS ONLY IN THIS CURRENT BUDGET REQUESTING- AT TWELVE ADDITIONAL SESSIONS TO FURTHER IMPLEMENT THE MASTER PLAN- CALLS- THREE OUT OF THE FOUR CAUSES. THAT REQUEST YEAR HR POSITIONS- THAT WILL BE CRITICAL IN HELPING US TO RECRUIT HIRE QUALITY STAFF. TO STOP THESE NEW INITIATIVES AS WELL AS LEADING INITIATIVES- THESE NEW POSITIONS WILL HELP US PROVIDE ADEQUATE ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FOR ALL THE NEW PROGRAMS WE'RE STANDING UP. THE EIGHT THIRTY CPA IS TO HELP US CONTINUE WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING- AS WE GO ALONG AND UNDERTAKE NEW INITIATIVES FOR THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING. WHERE I'M EXPANDING OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND STAFF CAPACITY TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR INITIATIVES. I'M IN THIS REQUEST REQUESTING TWELVE NEW POSITIONS BROKEN OUT AS FOLLOWS- FOUR RESEARCH POSITIONS TO BEGIN THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CPA'S RESEARCH AND IT OPERATIONS. TO SUPPORT THEM INITIATIVES AND THE MPA DIASPORA TRANSITION FROM CDPH TO CDA AS WELL AS REDUCE OUR NEED FOR EXTERNAL CONSULTANTS TO HELP US MAINTAIN THE PASSPORT- BY DOING SO THIS WILL HELP THE SPPORT DATA DRIVEN DECISION AND POLICY MAKING. AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DATA INFORMED PROGRAMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE- CD EIGHT IS NOT CURRENTLY HAVE RESEARCH POSITIONS BEYOND ONE CURRENT. RESOURCE AT RESEARCH RESOURCE. THE- SO THIS THAT WERE CHECKING GROUPING OF. I HAVE TO DEAL WITH OUR FOCUS ON EQUITY STILL REQUESTING SHE EQUITY TO ENSURE THAT EQUITY IS EMBEDDED IN ALL AGING PROGRAMS AND NEW MPA INITIATIVES AS WELL. INTERNALLY TO CBA'S HIRING AND RECRUITMENT PROCESSES. WERE ALSO REQUESTING ONE TRIBAL LIAISON THAT WILL PARTNER WITH CALIFORNIA STRIVES. TO ENSURE THAT THE TRIBES ARE WHERE HAVE ACCESS TO ALL AGING PROGRAMS AND THAT THE NEEDS OF TRIBAL ELDERS ARE PROPERLY CONSIDERED IN OUR AGING PROGRAMS. WE'RE ALSO REQUIRED ONE SENIOR STAFF POSITION THAT WILL REPORT COMMITTEE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR AGING POLICY RESEARCH IN EQUITY. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS WILL PROVIDE DAY TO DAY DIRECTION AND OPERATIONS OF THE DIVISION AS WELL AS LEADING HE- AND ITS CBS INITIATIVES. WE'RE ALSO ASKING FOR COMMUNICATIONS POSITIONS TO EXPAND OUR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS ABILITIES AS WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING AND- OUR H. C. B. S. INITIATIVES WE'RE COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT ALL STAKEHOLDERS ARE INFORMED AND ACTIVELY ENGAGED. IN THE I'M GOING TO ELEMENT IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MTA AND THAT THERE ARE ALSO INFORMED AT THE PROGRESS THAT WE'RE MAKING ON OUR INITIATIVES. AND THEN FINALLY THEY WERE REQUESTING ONE POSITION TO ACT AS A LIAISON WITH LOCAL PUBLIC GUARDIAN'S OFFICE IS- WHICH CHANNEL- DISCUSS NOW AS IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION. PRAYER ASK QUESTIONS READ THREE- THE QUESTION IS HOW WILL THE PUBLIC GUARDIAN LAYS ON INSURE PROGRAM CONSISTENCY AND EQUITY OUR OUTCOMES BEING MEASURED AND HOW WILL THIS INFORMATION BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. SO CITY PROPOSES TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP WITH LOCAL MCCARTY AND OFFICE SAYS AS IT RELATES SPECIFICALLY TO PROBATE CONSERVATORSHIP FOR OLDER ADULTS AND THE LOCAL PUBLIC GUARDIANS NOT AS WE KNOW ARE ESSENTIAL FOR ESTABLISHING A SYSTEM OF SUPPORTS FOR VULNERABLE OLDER ADULTS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR WORK IS INTEGRATED WITH ALL THE GREAT WORK THAT WE'RE DOING UNDER THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING- IN PARTICULAR. MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE CLOSELY CO ORDINATED WITH THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING WITH THE ELDER JUSTICE COORDINATING COUNCIL. IN TERMS OF ENSURING EQUITY AND CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE STATE IN SPEAKING WITH THE T. A. P. G. P. C. ASSOCIATION. IT'S CLEAR ABOUT THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS NEEDS TO BE ACQUIRED REQUIRED FULL COMPREHENSIVE DATA ABOUT- PROBATE CONSERVATORSHIP- THAT STATUS CURRENTLY HELD BY THE COURTS- SOMEWHAT COCONSPIRATORS WILL. ALSO COLLECT SOME OF THIS DATA BUT IT'S- ON A VERY AD HOC BASIS SO WE REALLY WANT TO ESTABLISH A STRONG DATA COLLECTION SYSTEM. ON THE NUMBER OF- TOTAL CONSERVATORSHIP IS THERE ARE STATEWIDE BUT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE- WHAT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE POPULATIONS BETTER SERVED AT THREE CONSERVATORSHIP. AND WHAT SORTS OF GAPS IN NEEDS I'M EXIST. THAT ARE DEMONSTRATED THROUGH THE DATA. WE THE LASER POSITION AS CAN BE AND TABLES. ON THE CONSERVATORSHIP PROCESS DISCUSS THE NEEDS AND GAPS OF THE CONSERVATORSHIP PROCESS AND HOW TO STRENGTHEN THE SYSTEM OVERALL- SIMPLISTIC HOLDERS WE SEE AND WHAT IT MEANS TABLES WOULD BE. OF COURSE THE LOCAL PUBLIC GUARDIAN OFFICE SAYS THAT PAP'S GPC ASSOCIATION. THAT IS WHAT COUNCIL CALIFORNIA REPRESENTATIVES FROM LOCAL SUPERIOR COURTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS AND ADVOCATES WE SEE THE OUTCOME OF THESE DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS AND CHECK OLDER DISCUSSIONS. TO BE A LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WILL BUILD TOWARDS IMPROVING STATEWIDE EQUITY AND. CONSISTENCY OF THE PROBATE CONSERVATORSHIP. WELL NOW MOVES YOU- QUESTION FOR WHICH ASKS YOU PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW. OF OUR KEY- H. C. B. S. M. NGA INITIATIVES- IN THE CURRENT YEAR. SO THE- FIRST HERE IT IS ON SENIOR NUTRITION- THAT'S REMAINS STEVIE'S LARGEST PROGRAM IN TERMS OF DOLLARS AND PEOPLE SEARCH. AND WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO REPORT THAT IN EDUCATION AUGMENTATIONS THAT CD RECEIVED BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE HAVE HAD A VERY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON- REDUCING THE MAIL GOT STATEWIDE- FOR OLDER ADULTS. SO PRIOR TO THE PANDA IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE TRIPLE A.'S THROUGH THEIR NUTRITION PROVIDERS SERVED APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN MILLION MEALS A YEAR- IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THE NETWORK WAS ABLE TO EXPAND AND GROW AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL NINE POINT FIVE MILLION MALES- FOR A TOTAL OF TWENTY EIGHT MILLION BALES SERVED- OVER A HUNDRED ANNUAL BASIS. FOR THIS CURRENT YEAR WE'RE EVEN GETTING CREATES OUR MAIL SERVER- EVEN GREATER AND GET UP TO THIRTY TWO MILLION MEALS SERVED SO AS WE CAN SEE THERE HAS BEEN JUST A TREMENDOUS GROWTH AND IMPACT ON- ADDRESSING SENIOR HUNGER NUTRITION STATEWIDE. IN TERMS OF CHALLENGE I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT- FOR THE NUTRITION PROGRAM- DURING THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC. OF THE FIRST ONE OF COURSE WAS THE REQUIREMENT DOROTHY- THE NEED FOR OUR NUTRITION PROVIDERS TO GREATLY GROW AND EXPAND THEIR OPERATIONS- CALVET HEAD AS QUICKLY AND THEY HAVE TO RESPOND QUICKLY- BUT THEY ARE ALL DEFINITELY ROSE TO THE OCCASION AND WITHIN A MATTER OF TWO TO THREE MONTHS- ARE TOOK PLACE YOU'RE ABLE TO. AMEND THEIR NUTRITION CONTRACTS AND OUR PROVIDERS ARE ABLE TO STAFF UP EXPAND THEIR OPERATIONS. CENTER INNOVATIONS LIKE- RESTAURANT PARTNERSHIPS GREATLY EXPAND THEIR OPERATIONS AND SERVICE ALL MALES. SO REALLY CAN'T SAY ENOUGH ABOUT OUR NUTRITION PROVIDERS THEY REALLY- WENT ABOVE AND BEYOND AND IN MEETING THE MOMENT. CALVET THE SECOND CHALLENGE WE HAVE WAS JUST THIS PAST SUMMER- THE H. REPLACE HER POSITION TO REOPEN THEIR IN PERSON AND CONGREGATE MEAL SITES. BUT WITH THE EMERGENCY OF THAT DELTA AND ALL CRIME% VARIANTS THEY HAD A DIFFERENT PLANS- NOW THAT THE CASE RATES ARE DECLINING- ARE TRIPLE A.'S CENTER AS SENIOR- CENTERS ARE NOW LOOKING TO. RESUME THEIR CONGREGATE MEAL SITES AND OF COURSE ALL THE THIS A PLEA- WITH- FOLLOWING PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS- BASS CONFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES. AND ENHANCE EQUIPMENT SPEAKS TO THE NUTRITION GAP IN CALIFORNIA. SO I'D LIKE TO POINT YOU TO RECENT STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED TO ATTEMPT TO QUANTIFY THE NUTRITION GAP IN CALIFORNIA. THE FIRST STUDY IS FROM THE NATIONAL ON PROFIT ORGANIZATION CALLED FEEDING AMERICA AND THEY PUBLISH AN ANNUAL REPORT ON SENIOR HUNGER CALLED THE STATE OF SENIOR HUNGER IN AMERICA. IN THE REPORT THERE'S A TABLE THAT SHOWS THE FOOD INSECURITY RATE BY STATE. THEIR LATEST REPORT WHICH COVERS CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN ESTIMATES THAT SIX POINT 3% OF CALIFORNIA'S OLDER ADULT POPULATION EXPERIENCES SOME LEVEL OF FOOD INSECURITY. AND ONE POINT 9% EXPERIENCED VERY LOW AFTER THE SECURITY. THE SECOND REPORT I'D LIKE TO POINT TWO ITS REPORT COMPLETED BY JANET JOHNSON AND ASSOCIATES AND THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ON BEHALF OF C. FOR A WHICH IS THE FIXATION THAT REPRESENTS LOCAL AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. STUDY ESTIMATED THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN RECOVERED EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY TWO MALES WERE BEYOND THE REACH OF LOW INCOME- OLDER ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA. DO THE EXPANSIONS OF CALFRESH BANKS BUILDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAMS AS WELL AS LEGISLATIVE AUGMENTATIONS. THE STATE WAS SUCCESSFULLY ABLE TO REDUCE THIS GAP. AND THE FOOD GAP HAD SHRUNK- I FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION MEALS TWO THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION MALES. CITY IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS ARE PARTNER DEPARTMENTS TO CONTINUE TO- BETTER REFINE AND DEFINE MAIL CAP IN CALIFORNIA FOR OLDER ADULTS- BUT WE WILL LOOK TO THE SAP RESEARCH. TO GUIDE US IN OUR STUDIES- I WILL NOW MOVE ON TO AND THIS IS P. AND THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS IS PAM THE RECENT- SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS THAT WERE REQUESTED SO THE- CURRENT BUDGET DID INCLUDE A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT FOR MSSP PROVIDERS- TO INCREASE THE RATES THAT REQUESTED SENT TO CMS WE'RE HAPPY TO SAY THAT REQUEST IS APPROVED AND SO THE MSSP RATES AT WILL AND WILL CONTINUE HIGHER RATES- THAT BUDGET ALSO INCLUDED AN EXPANSION OF MSSP SITES RETURN THEM TO THEIR SLOT. LEVELS PRIOR 220-008-2000 TEN RECESSION LEVELS- THE MSSP SITES ARE CURRENTLY STAFFING UP TO- SERVICE OFFICIAL PEOPLE IN RESPONSE AND- HAPPY TO SAY THAT MOST OF THE SITES HAVE A 75280% FILL RATE FOR THEIR SITES SO AS A STEP UP WE DO EXPECT THOSE. PERCENTAGES TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE. ALL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY PROJECT. SO THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP THAT WE'RE ENGAGED IN WITH THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION- TO ALLOCATE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GRANT FUNDS TO COUNTIES IN ORDER TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. FOR OLDER ADULTS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES- PRIMARILY FOR THE PURPOSE OF REDUCING FEELINGS OF SISTER SOCIAL ISOLATION DEPRESSION- THROUGH THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY. THAT WE HAVE HAD TWO MEETINGS WITH CW DA AND- BOLLINGER COUNTY PRESENTERS TO HELP US DEFINE THE SCOPE OF THE PROGRAM- THE REQUIREMENTS. FUNDING ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY AND EVALUATION- RIGHT NOW WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON THE FUNDING ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY. AND WE HOPE TO HAVE DECISIONS MADE ON THAT WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH TO TWO MONTHS- WILL THEN- GO OUT WITH GRANT SOLICITATIONS THE COUNTIES. SINCE THIS IS THE GRANT PROGRAM. AND WE EXPECT RESPONSES BACK BY SUMMER AND TO ACTUALLY ALLOCATE. OUT THE FRANCE BY LATE SUMMER. I'M NOT MOVING. SHE REPRESENTATIVE.

AND WE WILL HAVE A PLANT IN. THE STATE NAY PROGRAM PROVIDES OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO WHICH IS THE COURT ORDER DATE FOR PATIENTS SENSE TO BE AVAILABLE. AT FACILITIES. AND THEN I'D LIKE TO BROAD DATE ON A EIGHTY R. C. PROGRAM WHICH I WILL LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT AS SEASONAL MENTIONED KEYSTONE PROGRAM- ADRC ARTISTS. ESSENTIAL AND CORE TO.

SAN BACKING BECAUSE MY ROOM AND LOOK AT ANY QUESTION YOU MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR K. SWARTS LAND WHOSE EXACT DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CAROL SPORTS LANDER I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING THE COMMISSION IS AN INDEPENDENT ADVISORY BODY ESTABLISHED IN STATE STATUTE TO SERVICE THE PRINCIPLE ADVOCATE BEFORE THE GOVERNOR LEGISLATURE AND STATE AGENCIES ABOUT HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S OLDER ADULTS. COMMISSION MEMBERS ARE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR IN BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE COMMISSIONERS REPRESENT THE STATE'S CULTURAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY AS WELL AS A RANGE OF EXPERTISE WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE FIELD OF AGING. ASIANS BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL REQUESTS TO PERMANENT FULL TIME POSITIONS AND AN INCREASE IN FEDERAL FUNDED THIRTY OF THREE HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND IN FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. AND TWO HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN THOUSAND I'M GOING TO PROVIDE THE COMMISSION WITH RESOURCES NECESSARY TO MEET STATUTORY MANDATES AND AN INCREASED WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THE MASTER PLAN IMPLEMENTATION. SUPPORTING COMMISSION MASTER PLAN PRIORITIES REQUIRES FOCUS STAFF WORK SUCH AS MONITORING STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND RELATED INITIATIVES LIKE CAL AIM AND THE LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE TASK FORCE. CONDUCTING RESEARCH AND POLICY ANALYSIS AND SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF RECORD MADE RECOMMENDATIONS AND DROPPING FACT SHEETS AND POLICY DOCUMENTS. THE REQUESTED POSITIONS ARE NOT ONLY CRITICAL BREASTED EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT MASTER PLAN IMPLEMENTATION THEY'RE ALSO IMPORTANT TO HELP CREATE A PROMINENT SOCIAL PRESENCE TO EDUCATE AND SOLICIT INPUT. FROM FROM DIVERSE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ON DECISIONS THAT IMPACT THEM AND TO PARTNER WITH CDA ON THE CALIFORNIA FOR ALL AGES CAMPAIGN TO ADDRESS AGEISM SUPPORT INCLUSION AND EQUITY FOR OLDER CALIFORNIANS. AND PROMOTE A POSITIVE. IMAGE OF EIGHTEEN ACROSS THE LIFESPAN. IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION ABOUT HOW- THE COMMISSION IS WORKING ON- IMPLEMENTATION FIRST OVER THE PAST TWO AND A HALF YEARS THE COMMISSION WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH AND SUPPORT CDA IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MASTER PLAN. AND TODAY CONTINUES TO SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION BY PROVIDING EXPERT GUIDANCE AND RECOMMENDATIONS AND PARTICIPATING ON MULTIPLE ADVISORY GROUPS SUCH AS THE ELDER AND DISABILITY JUSTICE COORDINATING COUNCIL AND DISABILITY AND AGING COMMUNITIES LIVING ADVISORY COMMITTEE. FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE COMMISSION IDENTIFIED FOR PRIORITY MASTER PLAN FOCUS AREAS OLDER ADULT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND INNOVATIVE MODELS THAT INCREASE ACCESS TO THE COORDINATION. AND ACQUISITION OF LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. TO SUPPORT THESE AREAS THE COMMISSION SUBSTITUTED SUBMITTED A PROPOSAL FOR INVESTMENT TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW LEADERSHIP POSITION FOR GERIATRIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THIS POSITION WOULD PROVIDE SPECIALIZED EXPERTISE TO ASSIST THE DEPARTMENT IN ADDRESSING THE WELL DOCUMENTED UNMET BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS OF OLDER CALIFORNIANS. WE FILL THIS POSITION IS ESPECIALLY CRITICAL TODAY GIVEN THE INCREASED SOCIAL ISOLATION EXPERIENCED BY OLDER ADULTS DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. ASIAN HAS ALSO IS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD ALLOW APPLICABLES RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY OR RCMP'S CURRENTLY SERVING SIX OF YOUR INDIVIDUALS TO NOW SERVE MORE THAN SIX INDIVIDUALS. FROM TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ALMOST FOUR THOUSAND RCMP'S CLOSE THEIR DOORS IN CALIFORNIA. WE EXPECT THIS BILL TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE BEDS ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE THE SMALLER RCMP'S WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE GREATER ECONOMIES OF SCALE. AND FINALLY THE COMMISSION IS SPONSORING A FORM IN MAY FOCUSED ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO JUST THE DIRECT CARE WORKFORCE GERONTOLOGY GERIATRICS IN RELATED FIELDS. AND WE'LL HEAR FROM INDUSTRY LEADERS RESEARCHERS EDUCATORS AND WORKERS THE COMMISSION'S GOAL IS TO DEVELOP AND SUBMIT CONCRETE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE ADMINISTRATION THAT WILL INCREASE DIVERSITY AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY IN THESE FIELDS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM JACKIE BUT OSSEO WITH THE L. L. CHECK A ROSY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE WE'VE REVIEWED THE PROPOSALS- UNDER THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND THE COMMISSION ON AGING AND WE HAVE NO CONCERNS AT THIS TIME. ONE THING THAT WE WOULD FLAG THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING MENTIONED IS- DURING THE PANDEMIC THERE WERE. ONE TIME DOLLARS PROVIDED BOTH BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THE STATE TO INCREASE NUTRITION SERVICES ESPECIALLY- FOR OLDER ADULTS WHO MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS. TO FOOD AT THE TIME. AS THOSE FUNDS RAMPED DOWN- THERE IS A QUESTION OF A- HOW WOULD WE GO ABOUT MAINTAINING SERVICE LEVELS- ACKNOWLEDGING THAT. DURING THE PANDEMIC- SOME FOLKS MAY HAVE EXPERIENCED A TEMPORARY CRISIS AND FOOD ACCESS. BUT ALSO WE KNOW THAT THERE WAS- PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC AN UNMET NEED A FOOD- ACCESS IN GENERAL. SO FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY STILL BE FACING CHRONIC FOOD INSECURITY- POST PANDEMIC- THE SUB COMMITTEE MAY WANT TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION. POLITICAL ABOUT TRACKING. AND THE IMPACT THAT THESE WERE ON THE RAMP DOWN OF THESE ONE TIME DOLLARS MAY HAVE ON SERVICE LEVELS- BUT ALSO WHAT OUR OPTIONS THAT COULD BE MADE AVAILABLE- TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS. THAT WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CHRONIC FOOD INSECURITY- STILL HAVE ACCESS TO SOME LEVEL OF FOOD ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM HELLO MICHAEL COSTA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M MICHAEL COSTELLO AND I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY IN MY ROLE AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE AREA AGENCIES ON AGING OF CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE PRIMARILY TO DISCUSS OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING YOU KNOW CHEATING THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE MASTER PLAN AND HOW THAT FITS WITH OUR FOUNDING MISSION. WHAT WERE ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE IS AN AMENDMENT TO THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE. FUNDAMENTAL TO THEIR PURPOSE WAS AND IS THE GOAL OF HELPING VULNERABLE OLDER ADULTS HOME AND IN COMMUNITY. SERVICES OFFERED BY TRIPLE A SIMPLE FALL FROM A NARROW SET OF COURSE SERVICES INTO A WIDE RANGE OF INFORMATION REFERRAL AND OTHER SERVICES. INCLUDING PROVISION TRANSPORTATION CASE MANAGEMENT AND A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS ADDRESSING SOCIAL ISOLATION. CHIPOTLE'S ACCOMPLISH THIS BY EITHER PROVIDING SERVICES DIRECTLY OR CONTRACTING WITH COMMUNITY NONPROFIT PROVIDERS FORMING INFORMAL AND FORMAL LOCAL PROVIDER NETWORKS IN THE PROCESS. IF YOU LOOK AT IT HISTORICALLY THE TRIPLE LIKE NETWORKS INVOLVED OVER THE SAME PERIOD THE MODERN HEALTHCARE PROVIDER NETWORKS DEVELOPMENT. ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE NEVER TALKED TO EACH OTHER MUCH. TELLING PROVIDES THE VEHICLE FOR THAT CONVERSATION BY PROVIDING THE PLATFORM FOR INTEGRATION OF SOCIAL AND HEALTH CARE SERVICE DELIVERY HE HAD AIMS TO ESTABLISH A TRUE CONTINUUM OF CARE. THAT WOULD ALLOW OLDER CALIFORNIANS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES TO REMAIN INDEPENDENT AND COMMUNITY FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. THERE ARE SOME SUCCESS FACTORS THAT NEED TO BE MET FOR THIS TO REALLY HAPPEN HOWEVER. WHAT IS A GOOD SOCIAL SERVICE AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS NEED TO SHARE THE SAME GOALS. AND THEY NEED TO SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE WHAT IS CASE MANAGEMENT TO A SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS NOT NECESSARILY. DEFINED IN THE SAME WAY AS IT IS FOR A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. AND YOU ALSO NEED TO BUILD THE CAPACITY IN THE FOR AFFECTED MOST OF THE DELIVERY NETWORK. AND RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF SOCIAL SERVICES THAT ARE DELIVERED BY REIMBURSING PROVIDERS ADEQUATELY. OF COURSE THE MASTER PLAN PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR ACHIEVING. THAT AS WELL INTERPOLATION THERE PARTNERS ARE THERE AT THE- OF PROOF SERVICE THAT ADDRESS. MASTER PLAN GOAL. SOME OF THE- MASTERPLAN GOAL NUMBER ONE HOUSING FOR ALL AGES CHEVROLETS PROVIDE HOUSING NAVIGATION AND ASSISTANCE AND HOME MODIFICATION ASSESSMENT AND REMEDIATION NOW. BUT COULD ALSO PROVIDE A VARIETY OF RENT SUBSIDY AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTABLE WITH ADEQUATE FUNDING. GOOD HEALTH REIMAGINED ADDRESS THE EXISTING NEED IS MAINTAIN WILL BE ENHANCED LEVEL OF MEAL PROVISION ACHIEVED DURING THE PANDEMIC BY USING STATE FUNDS TO REPLACE EXPIRING FEDERAL FUNDS AS WELL AS THE SPEAKER- I MEAN WE PUT BEFORE ME MENTIONED I WANTED ACCENTUATE OUT AS WELL THE EXPIRING FUNDS ADDRESSED MUCH OF THE NEED BUT THERE STILL REMAINS A DEFICIT. TO- AN ESTIMATE THREE SEVENTY MEALS A YEAR MILLION A YEAR WHICH SHOULD BE ADDRESSED GOING FORWARD. DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMER'S MAY WELL BECOME THE DEFINING DIAGNOSIS FOR OLDER CALIFORNIANS BUILDING A DIMENSION A DIMENSION APPLICATION PROGRAM CAN START BY DEVELOPING PILOT PROGRAMS FOR DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMER'S NAVIGATION SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE SOMETHING WHICH WE- AS A GROUP. AS AN ASSOCIATION AND OTHERS ADVOCATE. GOAL NUMBER THREE INCLUSION NOT ISOLATION VOLUNTEER TRAINING RETENTION CAN BUILD BACK THE SUPPLY OF VOLUNTEERS FOR MULTIPLE PROGRAMS DECIMATED DURING THE PANDEMIC MANY OF WHICH ARE AWFUL BUT BY TRIPLE A.'S AND THEIR COMMUNITY PARTNERS. WE HAVE A PROPOSED AN APPROACH THAT IS PART OF OUR BUDGET ASK. NUMBER FOR CARE GIVER SUPPORT EXAMPLES OF EXISTING TRIPLE A CAREGIVER DIRECTED SERVICES INCLUDE INFORMATION ASSISTIVE DEVICES CASE MANAGEMENT CARE GIVER COUNSELING LEGAL RESOURCES RESPITE SUPPORT CAREGIVER TRAINING AND HOME ADAPTATIONS. BUT THERE ARE OTHER THINGS TO CONSIDER PUTTING SUBSIDY PROGRAMS THAT ALLOW RECIPIENTS TO PURCHASE RESPITE SERVICES ADULT DAYCARE AND HOUSING ASSISTANCE. IN THE END- TRIPOLI'S OFFER AND ARE PROPOSING IN IN OUR BUDGET ASK- CARE GIVER SERVICES THAT CAN BE BUILT ON GOING FORWARD. CAN WE DO THIS ALONE OF COURSE NOT WE ARE COMMITTED TO STRENGTHENING COLLABORATION WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND WE'VE ESTABLISHED A PRODUCTIVE CLIENT COLLABORATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. ARMS BEEN VERY OPEN TO THAT WE WILL BOTH IT IS. TO ACHIEVE MASTER PLAN GOALS WE ARE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE THAT AVAILABLE IN PIPELINE FUNDING ARE USED WISELY AND WE ARE REASONING TOGETHER TO PLAN AND DELIVER SERVICES MORE EFFECTIVELY. IT'S ESPECIALLY HEARTENING TO SEE THE DEPARTMENT STAFF UP IN A VARIETY OF AREAS. TO BE BETTER ABLE TO PERFORM THEIR VARIOUS ROLES AS IT pFRANKLY TO THEIR INTERACTION WITH THE TRIPLE IT. WE ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE SUFFICIENT FUNDING IS AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT THE SERVICES. BOTH EXISTING AND PROPOSED THAT I MENTIONED. HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM BECKY DUFFY WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ADULT DAY SERVICES. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR DR ARAMBULA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH YOU TODAY AS YOU JUST MENTIONED I'M BECKY DUFFY I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR ADULT DAY SERVICES. IT'S A MEMBER ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING ALMOST TWO HUNDRED COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES AN ADULT DAY PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. OVER FORTY THOUSAND LOW INCOME FRAIL ELDERS AND ADULTS RELY ON OUR SERVICES TO AVOID NURSING HOMES AND COSTLY HOSPITAL VISITS. CENTERS COMBAT SENIOR ISOLATION. AND IT HAS BEEN AT A PEAK DURING COBIT AND IT DOES LEAD TO COGNITIVE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL DETERIORATION. 96% OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN OUR PROGRAMS ARE MEDICARE AL 60% ARE WOMEN VERY ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATION 44% OF OUR PARTICIPATE ARE PARTICIPANTS. LIVE ALONE AND THEY WOULD OTHERWISE NOT BENEFIT FROM CARE AND THE SOCIAL INTERACTION THAT'S PROVIDED AT OUR CENTERS. SINCE THE PANDEMIC BECAME- BEGAN AND CURRENTLY CENTERS HAVE HAD LOTS OF CHALLENGING STAFFING ISSUES I WOULD SAY STAFFING IS THEIR NUMBER ONE ISSUE. THE MAIN PROBLEM THEY HAVE IS THAT THEY CAN'T COMPETE WITH HOSPITALS IN TERMS OF GETTING REGISTERED NURSES AND THEY ARE ALSO DEALING WITH THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN RAISED SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND TWELVE AND WE ALL KNOW HOW THE COST OF LIVING HAS INCREASED. DRAMATICALLY SINCE THEN AND THEY CANNOT OPERATE WITHOUT THE MINIMUM REQUIRED NUMBER OF REGISTERED NURSES AND SOCIAL WORKERS. THE FEDERAL SPENDING PLAN DOES INCLUDE ALLOWANCES FOR HARDSHIPS AND STAFFING AND WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY WITH- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT AGING THEY'VE BEEN A WONDERFUL PARTNER FOR US THEY DO HAVE SOME HELP COMING DOWN THE PIKE FOR WORK FORCE ISSUES HOWEVER AT THIS POINT THOSE PLANS DON'T INCLUDE REGISTERED NURSING STAFF- DID JUST HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH SERWIS DEAN HOUSE AND YESTERDAY ABOUT THAT AND WILL BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH HER. CENTERS ALSO CONTINUE TO FACE CHALLENGES PROVIDING SERVICES TO KEEP PARTICIPANTS AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE POST PANDEMIC. AS WE KNOW FRAIL ELDERS ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE TO COPE IT AND ARE HIGHER RISK OF DEATH FROM INFECTION CENTERS HAVE REMAINED OPEN DURING THE PANDEMIC. BUT THEY'VE HAD TO RELY ON TEMPORARY APPROVED EMERGENCY SERVICES THROUGH THE STATE AND PERHAPS TO HAVE PROVIDED FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING AND INFECTION CONTROL AND INCREASED INFECTION CONTROL TO KEEP THE SENIORS THAT. HAVE BEEN COMING IN POTENTIALLY EVEN ON A ONE ON WAIT ONE BASIS TO THE CENTER SAFELY. SO AS WE MOVE FROM PANDEMIC TO ENDEMIC AND RETURN TO CENTER. THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO RETURN TO CENTER IN FULL CAPACITY. SO THEY NEED TO MAKE NECESSARY MODIFICATIONS TO THEIR PHYSICAL SPACES TO HARDEN THEIR SPACES TO ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. IT INCLUDES IMPROVING VENTILATION SYSTEMS MODIFYING INDOOR SPACES THANK YOU KNOW ALLOWING FOR SOCIAL DISTANCING REPLACING WINDOWS AND UTILIZING OUTDOOR SPACES IN WAYS THEY MAY NOT HAVE HAD TO USE THEM BEFORE. THEY ALSO HAVE THE HARD THE CENTERS IN CASE THERE ARE FUTURE PUBLIC EMERGENCIES. AND EVEN PREPARE FOR THINGS LIKE WILDFIRES. ALL OF THESE ARE UNBUDGETED EXPENSES THAT FACILITIES HAVE HAD TO PAY FOR OUT OF POCKET DURING THE PANDEMIC. ANOTHER HUGE ISSUE THAT THE CENTERS ARE FACING AS TRANSPORTATION AND I HAVE SOME EXAMPLES ON NOT- IN SAN FRANCISCO TO RETURN TO CENTER. TO GET PARA TRANSIT READY FOR PARTICIPANTS IT CAN TAKE UP TO SIXTY DAYS IF IT'S EVEN AVAILABLE- IN OXNARD I HAVE A CENTER. WHERE THEIR DRIVERS ARE BEING STOLEN AT GAS STATIONS AND RECRUITED BY FEDERAL EXPRESS SO THEY REALLY HAVE TROUBLE KEEPING TRANSPORTATION GOING. AND THEN THE L. A. N. ORANGE COUNTY CENTERS HAVE ANOTHER UNIQUE PROBLEM THEIR CATALYTIC CONVERTERS KEEP GETTING STOLEN. AND AS SOON AS THEY REPLACE THEM EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE IN GATED. AND IN THESE AREAS THAT THEY JUST KEEP HAVING TO REPLACE THEM AGAIN. SO ALLOCATING FUNDING IN NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET TO CREATE GRANTS FOR THE FACILITIES TO TACKLE THESE EXPENSIVE CHALLENGES WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT STEP FORWARD. AT THE END OF THE DAY THE STATE NEEDS TO INVEST IN ADULT DAY SERVICES FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THESE SERVICES SAVE LIVES AND KEEP SENIORS OUT OF NURSING HOMES. THEY KEEP THEM OUT OF ISOLATION AND IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE THEY CAN SURVIVE AND THRIVE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS- I WILL KEEP IT HERE AT THE CHAIR. MY FIRST QUESTIONS GOING TO BE FOR DIRECTOR DUMB MORRIS AS WELL AS MISS WARS LANDER I'M TRYING TO REALLY. GET WHAT ARE THE MOST DIRE NEEDS. THAT WE HAVE AT THIS CURRENT MOMENT IS IT- AS AN EXAMPLE EITHER SENIOR HOMELESSNESS SENIOR HUNGER. OR IS IT HEALTH DISPARITIES CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT AND THEN HOW WILL THE MASTER PLAN BE ABLE TO PIVOT TO THESE PRIORITY ISSUES- BASED ON CURRENT EVENTS THAT WE HAVE COMING DOWN HOPING YOU CAN PROVIDE SOME INITIAL COMMENTS. SURE THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I'LL GO AHEAD AND START AND THEN CAROL IF YOU WANTED TO FOLLOW- YOU YOU HEAD ON- EXACTLY WHAT THE LEADING ISSUES ARE AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN SAY THAT THERE IS ONE ISSUE- IF YOU MAP IT TO THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING THE FIRST GOAL AREA IS HOUSING FOR ALL AGES AND STAGES. WE KNOW FOR A FACT THE RESEARCH WORK OUT OF UCSF THAT THE LARGEST AND FASTEST THE FASTEST GROWING DEMOGRAPHIC IN OUR STATE OR- HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IS AMONG OLDER ADULTS. SO WE ARE WORKING- IN WITH- OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND ACROSS AGENCIES AND I DO PARTICIPATE ON THE INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS. AND THAT'S A NEW ADDITION TO HAVE THE VOICE AND PERSPECTIVE OF AGING ON THAT. ON THAT BODY WERE SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION WORK THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. AND DEFINITELY THROUGH THE AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CONNECTIONS AND OUR TRIPLE A PARTNERS WE ARE LINKING INDIVIDUALS AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL WITH HOUSING ASSISTANCE- WHERE WE CAN- IN TERMS OF SENIOR NUTRITION WE ARE VERY PROUD AS MARK BECKLEY MENTIONED. TO HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF MEALS THAT ARE DELIVERED AND WE KNOW THERE ARE STILL GAPS IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE WORK CLOSELY WITH PARTNERS FOODBANKS MEALS ON WHEELS. AND OTHER LOCAL PARTNERS AS PART OF A NETWORK CDA PLAYS A KEY LEAD ROLE AND WE'RE NOT THE ONLY MALE PROVIDER IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES- IN TERMS OF OTHER CHALLENGES THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES FACING OUR NETWORK. I THINK THE GROWTH IN THE COMPLEXITY OF CARE TODAY AS AS PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA LIVE LONGER WE HAVE THE SECOND. LONGEST LIFESPAN IN THE NATION- THAT COMES WITH MORE COMPLEX CARE NEEDS IN THE AIR IN OF SPECIFICALLY AS KAREN MENTIONED- BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ALZHEIMER'S AND DEMENTIA AS MICHAEL COSTA MENTIONED- AND A DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS WHO ARE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT PEOPLE AT HOME. WHICH PLACES A HIGHER RELIANCE ON THE DIRECT CARE WORK FORCE. US TO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE LEADING CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE- WORKING ON AS A DEPARTMENT AND ALSO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. IT WILL MISS WORST WONDER. I'M GONNA CONCUR WITH DIRECTOR DEMAREST THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO CHOOSE ONE- THE COMMISSION HAS A STRATEGIC PLAN AND WE HAD PRIORITIES BUT ACTUALLY WE- AT THE END OF LAST YEAR WE REALIZED ALL THESE NEW ISSUES WERE COMING TO THE FOREFRONT SO THAT'S WHY WE PRIORITIZE THOSE FOUR AREAS. AND IN PARTICULAR OLDER ADULT BEHAVIOR HEALTH I MEAN THE PANDEMIC JUST RAISE THE PROFILE OF THE IMPACT ON OLDER ADULTS THEN HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS ISSUES AND MENTIONED THAT FOR FASTEST GROWING POPULATION IS FIFTH AGE FIFTY AND OLDER AND THEN WORKFORCE THAT REALLY CAME TO THE FOREFRONT SO. IF I HAD TO PICK MY TOP THREE IT WOULD BE THERE BUT ALSO NUTRITION IT S HARD TO CHOOSE THERE'S SO MANY COMPETING NEEDS BUT THAT'S HOW THE COMMISSION PRIORITIZED OUR OUR RESOURCES AND FOCUS- DIRECTOR OMINOUS. WITH SENIOR NUTRITION AND FOLLOW UP ON THE L. A. O.'S QUESTION IF I CAN. WHAT'S GOING TO OCCUR WHEN THESE ONE TIME FUNDS RAMPED DOWN HOW ARE WE GOING TO BE TRACKING WHAT'S- GOING TO BE OCCURRING WITH SENIOR FOOD AND SECURITY WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS- TO THOSE WHO REMAIN FOOD INSECURE AFTER THIS- WE HEARD EARLIER ABOUT THE SENIOR MEALS GAP BEING AT THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY. MILLION WHAT OCCURS POST THE CLIFF WHEN THIS ONE TIME FUNDING RUNS OUT. I'LL TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THAT AND THEN I'LL INVITE MARC BECKLEY TO WHO HAS BEEN MORE- TOGETHER THAN I DO- BUT THAT IS SOMETHING WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON LOOKING AT THE STATE FISCAL YEAR AND THE DIFFERENT FEDERAL SOURCES INCLUDING THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT ARE STAGGERED- SO THERE'S NOT ONE. ONE DATE WHERE THE CLIP WILL HAPPEN IT WILL BE STATE SO I'M GONNA ASK MARK TO ELABORATE A BIT ON ON THE FORECAST THAT WE'VE MADE AT THE DEPARTMENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIS AND I'M HAPPY TO DO SO MISTER CHAIR. SO YOU KNOW FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION OR- PROVIDING ONGOING AUGMENTATION FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN NUTRITION FUNDING- THAT IS DEFINITELY GOING TO HELP- STAVE OFF THE QUICK SOMEWHAT. ALTHOUGH BUT YOU KNOW CLEARLY THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVE THROUGH FEDERAL STIMULUS MONEY- YOU KNOW IT WAS MUCH HIGHER THAN THAT LEVEL. BUT THAT IS GOING TO HELP. A BIT WITH THAT GAP- AND YOU KNOW WILL BE LOOKING FOR OTHER FEDERAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES- OTHER STATE OPPORTUNITIES TO- YOU KNOW IF THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE MAIL GAP IN CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS LOOKING AT OTHER PROGRAMSSUCH AS CALFRESH- THE FOOD ANKS- LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS YOU KNOW WE ALWAYS TRY TO KEEP UP THOSE PARTNERSHIPS. AND COORDINATE OUR ACTIVITIES TO TRY TO CAST PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE. AND IN. NEED OF NUTRITION SERVICES STATEWIDE. THANK YOU FOR THAT ARE I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THIS ISSUE TOGETHER- I'D LIKE TO ASK MY LAST QUESTION IF I CAN ON. EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS AND I WILL ASK IT FOR A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AND UNDERSTAND YOU MIGHT. NOT HAVE THE INFORMATION TODAY. BUT I'LL BEGIN ON PAGE NINE OF THE AGENDA. IN REGARDS TO THE TECHNOLOGY ACCESS PROGRAM. FIRST I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT GOALS DO YOU HAVE AROUND ENSURING WE HAVE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE FUNDS AND SECOND. CAN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING PLEASE PROVIDE US A MAP WHICH SHOWS HOW THE FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED ONCE THOSE DECISIONS ARE MADE. I'D LIKE TO MAKE A SIMILAR REQUEST FOR MAPPING AND DISTRIBUTION. AND UNDERSTANDING HOW IT WAS DECIDED FOR THE SENIOR NUTRITION INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING OF FORTY MILLION. AND FOR THE EIGHTY R. C. INVESTMENTS TO KNOW WHERE THE TWENTY FOUR EIGHTY OR SEIZE ARE LOCATED. CAN THE DEPARTMENT PLEASE PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE ON ATR SEES NOW AND FOR THE TECHNOLOGY ACCESS AND SENIOR NUTRITION INFRASTRUCTURE INVENTS INVESTMENTS ONCE THOSE ARE AVAILABLE. BUT IF YOU COULD PLEASE JUST WALK US THROUGH HOW THE PROCESS FOR IMPLEMENTATION IS MINDFUL OF THOSE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION CALLS. YES THE STRUCTURE AT THIS IS MARC QUICKLY I CAN PROVIDE YOU THE HIGH LEVEL METHODOLOGY THAT WE'RE USING- FOR OUR- NUTRITION ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY- PROGRAMS. AND WHAT WE DO IT'S YOU- STRIVE TOWARDS- EQUITY SO FOR OUR NUTRITION PROGRAM WE- DISTRIBUTE THOSE FUNDS THEY'RE WHAT WE CALL OUR IF FORMULA OR THE FEDERAL INTERSTATE FUNDING FORMULA. THAT ACCOUNTS FOR THE PERCENTAGE OF OLDER ADULTS- AND ARMOR- YES THEY BOUNDARIES AS WELL AS NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS FOR A LOW INCOME RURAL SO THERE'S- A FEW FACTORS THAT WE LOOK AT. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DISPUTING THE FUNDING EQUITABLY- ACROSS THE PSAS AND THAT'S TRUE FOR ALL OF OUR OLDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAMS. UP FOR THE ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY IN DISCUSSIONS- RIGHT NOW WITH CWD A ABOUT. ONE OF THE OPTIONS IS TO DO A- FUNDING FORMULA SIMILAR TO THE F. TO LOOK AT PERCENTAGE OF OLDER ADULTS AND THOSE ARE LOW INCOME- AND THOSE WHO HAVE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS SO WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH THAT PROCESS BUT ONCE WE HAVE THAT. I WANT YOU TO FIND WILL BE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT- AND- WRITTEN. SO LET ME SEE SO TECHNOLOGY- NUTRITION. HOW EIGHTY OUR SEATS SO WITH A EVER SEEN IT IS ALSO IT'S ACROSS- LOOKING AT THE LEVEL ADULTS AMENDED- INTO WITH DISABILITIES AND DIFFERENT OF THE STATE. AND THEN A BASE COMPLEMENTED THAT THEY GET AND THEN ADJUSTING THAT BASED ON THOSE OTHER FACTORS AND ALSO NOTE THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO REFINE THAT FUNDING FORMULA SOMEWHAT WE'RE NOTICING THAT- DEPENDING ON HOW DIFFERENT EIGHTY OUR SEATS OR STAGE IN THEIR GROWTH RATE THEY MIGHT NOT NEED AS MUCH MONEY OR THEY MIGHT NEED MORE MONEY UP FRONT SHE REALLY GET THEIR PROGRAMS OFF THE GROUND. START TRYING TO DO A MORE NUANCED APPROACH WITH HIS INITIAL ALLOCATIONS- AND THEN WILL DEFINITELY. CREATE A STANDARD- OUT OF CARE. YOU SAID IT WAS PERCENT OF OLDER ADULTS- IS THAT OLDER ADULTS INCLUSIVE OF ALL CALIFORNIANS OR ARE THERE LIMITATIONS- SINCE IT'S A FEDERAL PROGRAM. ON HOW WE ARE- COUNTING OLDER ADULTS. RIGHT SO WHAT- UNDER THE- FEDERAL OLDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAM- IT'S BASED ON OLDER ADULTS OR SIXTY PLUS- SO THAT'S THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR THAT SO THAT'S THE POPULATION OF WHERE THAT WE LOOK AT I WILL THE NEXT ASK THE QUESTION EXPLICITLY- CITIZENS VERSUS- OTHER CALIFORNIANS- WE YOU KNOW WE- ARE NOT REQUIRED TO IN ORDER WE ASK ABOUT SOMEBODY'S OR IMMIGRATION STATUS. SO IT'S ALL OLDER ADULTS BEFORE WE GO ON TO THE NEXT ITEM I FIRST WANT TO THANK THIS PANEL FOR HELPING US TO UNDERSTAND THE LANDSCAPE OF WORK INVOLVED IN THE MASTER PLAN OF AGING. INCLUDING THE UPDATES ON INVESTMENTS WHICH WERE MADE AS PART OF OUR RECENT BUDGET WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK CLOSELY AT THESE AREAS AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. ON ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY TO SPENDING PLAN WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD OPEN ISSUES FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING. AND WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO. WITH ISSUE TWO WE WILL BE DISCUSSING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND OVERSIGHT ISSUES FOR THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES IHS US PROGRAM.

I ALSO JUST ADD DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AS WE'RE LOOKING TO IMPLEMENT I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT ONE OF THE INTERNAL OPERATIONAL CHANGES WE'VE MADE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IS TO ORGANIZE OURSELVES IN THE WAY TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN THOSE INTEGRATION OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING.

I ALSO JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHTS THE CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LEGISLATURE TO SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS TO EXPAND SUPPORT SO LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BLIND OR OVER SIXTY FIVE OR WHO ARE DISABLED OR PERSONAL CARE AND OTHER SERVICES.

MISS PHYLLIS IN- JUST- WE HAD A TECHNICAL COLLECTION MISSED THE PAST MAJORITY OF YOUR TESTIMONY THUS FAR I MAY ASK YOU TO BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING IF THAT'S OKAY- AND I APPRECIATE THAT. SURE DEFINITELY CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME NOW. LOUDLY AND CLEARLY THANK YOU PERFECT ALL RIGHT SO I WAS- GOING OVER THE OVERVIEW OF THE HSS BUDGET SO THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET REFLECTS AN INCREASE OF ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS REALLY- DUE TO CONTINUED JAMES SPOKE PRO OSCAR OUR WORK AND THE WORST PER CASE- THIS BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES A FULL YEAR OF COST OF THE INCREASE TO MINIMUM WAGE. TO FIFTEEN DOLLARS PER HOUR. SOME OF THE NEW ITEMS IN THE BUT INCLUDES THE PERMANENT PROVIDERS. THE CONTINUOUS COVERAGE- PHASING IN THE MEDICAL ASSET LIMIT REPEAL. OF A TEMPORARY SIX POINT TWO F. MAP INCREASE RELATED TO OBEY IT AS WELL AS- THE EVENING ETERNAL REDOX. OF HALF OF THE YEAR. I'LL GO AHEAD AND GO TO- NUMBER TWO. WHAT THE RISKS OF MEDICAL REDETERMINATION EXPECTED TO OCCUR JULY TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOUR I JUST AS RECIPIENTS CAN HELP THE FEET THE- ATTEMPTS TO AVOID A POTENTIAL LOSS OF SERVICES PROVIDES US WITH THE- SO OUR PLAN IS TO WORK WITH THE H. C. S. TO REALLY MAXIMIZE CONTENT. CONTINUITY OF COVERAGE FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. ENSURE THAT WE KEEP THE PROCESS AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE FOR OUR JUST AS RECIPIENTS. AND REALLY HUMANS ARE STAKEHOLDERS- COUNTIES CONSUMER ADVOCATES CETERA AS MESSENGERS. AT AND OUR AUTOMATED- MESSAGING COMMUNICATION CHANNELS TO DISSEMINATE OUTRAGE MESSAGING TO REALLY REMIND PEOPLE TO. COMPLETE THEIR MEDICAL RETIREMENT EACH. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT BEACH YESTERDAY TO EXPLORE A NUMBER OF FEDERAL FLEXIBILITY IN THIS AREA AND WE PLAN ON WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH THEM ON ON THESE POLICIES AS IT RELATES TO MEDICAL. REDETERMINATION AND THE NEED FOR POLICY GUIDANCE TO THE. THE QUESTION NUMBER THREE IS WHAT THE ISSUES ARE BEING RAISED REGARDING THE PERMANENT PROVIDER BACKUP SYSTEM AND WHAT IS THE ADMINISTRATION'S RESPONSE. WHAT IS THE STATUS OF STAKEHOLDERS SPECIALISTS AND WINNABLE A NEW VERSION OF TRAILER BILL BEING RELEASED. SO WE'VE SO FAR RECEIVED FEEDBACK FROM OUR LABOR ORGANIZATIONS CAPITAL C. WAMC'S FACT- THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED INCLUDED- ASKING FOR THE WAGE DIFFERENTIAL. UP TO BE ICLUDED IN THE LANGUAGE SIMILAR TO THE EMERGENCY BACK UP PROVIDER SYSTEM FOR KOBE- I THINK THEY'RE FLYING LANGUAGE TO DEFINE TERMS IN CONSIDERATION OF THE INCREASE IN THE EIGHTY HOUR CAP- WE ARE STILL ENGAGING IN FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND WE INTEND TO RELEASE A REVISEDTRAILER BILL BY THE END OF APRIL- WE'RE- AND- OF. AS ALWAYS WE ARE COMMITTED TO IDENTIFIES SYSTEM THAT ENSURES HSS RECIPIENTS RECEIVE THE SUPPORTS THAT THEY NEED A THROUGH THE EMERGENCY BACKUP PROVIDERS SYSTEM. THE NEXT QUESTION IS PLEASE DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCES AND NEED FOR THE I. HSS IMPORTER DEFINITION TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL. SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE LET EVERYBODY KNOW THAT WE CONSIDER THIS TRAILER BILL TO BE TECHNICAL IN NATURE AND IT DOES NOT PROPOSED TO CHANGE EXISTING LAW RATHER CODIFIED- FIELD LABOR CODE THAT THE COUNTING IN THE STATE ARE NOT THE. HERE BEING OF EXISTING IS REALLY TO STOP A- IN WHICH AGENTS RESEARCH HAVE THEM BEING RULES TO HIRE ALL OF I AS- WELL TO THOSE HSS PROVIDERS WERE PART OF THE REGISTRY. EXISTING ONE NEVER INTENDED TO REQUIRE THE STATE'S GOING TO ASSUME LEGAL LIABILITY FOR THE ACTIONS ARE YOU JUST AS RECIPIENTS WHO ACT AS EMPLOYERS IN THEIR OWN HOMES. NEXT QUESTION PLEASE PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE IHS US CAREER PATHWAYS PROGRAM AND SHARE ANY ISSUES OR CHALLENGES OF WHICH THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE AWARE. IN COLLABORATION WITH STAKEHOLDERS WE ESTABLISHED TO GENERAL CAREER PATHWAYS ARE RICH ARE REALLY FOUNDATIONAL IN THE PREPARATION OF OTHER HEALTH CARE FIELDS AND AN ADDITIONAL THREE SPECIALIZED- PATHWAYS WHICH ARE REALLY MEANT TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF SERVICES THAT ARE HSS RECIPIENTS RECEIVE. WE HOSTED THREE I'M LISTENING SESSIONS WITH A MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. OF THE MOST RECENTLY WAS ON MARCH TENTH TWENTY TWENTY TWO A LOT OF REALLY GREAT FEEDBACK FROM I JUST AS PROVIDERS WERE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY WE- HAVE BEGUN WORKING WITH COUNTIES AND PUBLIC AUTHORITIES WEEK SENT A SURVEY- TO FIGURE OUT HOW MANY OF THEM WOULD BE INTERESTED IN BEING PART OF THE CAREER PATHWAYS PROGRAM. IN TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES EXPRESSED INTEREST- SO WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THOSE CHINESE MOVING FORWARD. WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON BRING ON A CONSULTANT WILL ASSIST WITH THE BUILDING OF THE ACTUAL CAREER PATHWAY CATALOG FOR THIS PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE- ASSISTANT AND THOSE TYPES OF. THAT INFORMATION THAT PROVIDERS WILL NEED. AN ALL AND MOST RECENTLY WE ISSUED THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL OR PROPOSAL ON MARCH ELEVENTH- FOR TREATING VENDORS THE R. P. WILL BE- WILL CONCLUDE ON APRIL TWENTY SECOND TWENTY TWENTY TWO- AND IT CAN BE EITHER ON THE KALECKI PORCHER. WEBSITE SO DEFINITELY MORE TO COME. A CAREER PATH THANKS. AND THEN THE QUESTION IS. HOW DOES YOU ASSESS OF THAT IS A PROCEDURES FOR I AS A LINE WITH THE WITH THE MASTER PLAN EACH. HAS OUR PARTNERS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING SPOKE ABOUT WE DEFINITELY WORK WITH THEM VERY CLOSELY ADDITIONALLY WE PARTICIPATED THROUGHOUT THE MATCH UPON AGING PROCESS WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT HSS WAS INTEGRATED INTO THE- HAS BEEN THE- SEVERAL THE- AND INITIATIVES- MY CAREER PATHWAYS- ARE BEING THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON THEM ANYTHING AND- THE REST. WERE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE AS PART OF THE MASTER PLAN. WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS TO FIND OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE SERVICES THAT'S DEFINITELY VERY IMPORTANT TO US AS WELL AS WE ARE ONE OF THE STATE MEMBERS UP ON THE DISABILITY. COMMUNITY LIVING ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHICH IS WORKING ON A LONG LONG TERM SIR SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ALONG WITH OTHER TOPICS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE ARE RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF OUR HSS RECIPIENTS AND AREN'T ALIGNED WITH THE MASK. H. SO THAT INCLUDES THE- THE QUESTIONS ON KA WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINAL. CONFERMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING TO ADD AT THIS TIME HAPPY ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM JACKIE BUT I WOULD THE L. A. HELLO- IT IN RESPONSE TO THE FIRST QUESTION- WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON JUST SOME TECHNICAL BUDGET QUESTIONS BUT- IN OUR INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE I JUST AS BUDGET A FEW THINGS THAT WE WOULD FLAG. IS ONE WE'RE STILL CONTINUING TO SEE THAT THE GROWTH IN H. SAYS PAID CASELOAD AND CONTINUES TO BE SLOWER THAN IT WAS IN PRECOVERED NINETEEN RATES- IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT. ON THIS TREND CAN BE DETAIL RECIPIENT STILL FEELING APPREHENSIVE ABOUT LEADING NON FAMILY NON LIVE IN PROVIDE SERVICES BUT ALSO THIS TREND COULD BE POSSIBLY DUE TO RECIPIENTS HAVING DIFFICULTY. LOCATING AND HIRING PROVIDERS- WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO GET ADDITIONAL DATA ON APPLICATION IN CASE LOAD INFORMATION- TO SEE IF THERE IF WE CAN FURTHER IDENTIFY ANY OTHER POSSIBLE REASONS THAT THIS COULD BE HAPPENING AND WE'LL MAKE SURE TO REPORT BACK TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE- AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. SECOND THING THAT I WOULD FLAG IS- IN OUR ANALYSIS WE ALSO FLAG THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER- THE FUTURE USES OF THE POPE IN NINETEEN PROGRAM FLEXIBILITIES THAT THE STATE IMPLEMENTED IN THE ACCESS PROGRAM SOME OF THESE INCLUDED- WAVING. FINGERPRINTING BACKGROUND CHECKS AND INSTEAD USING NAME BASED BACKGROUND CHECKS OTHERS INCLUDED- ALLOWING COUNTIES TO CONDUCT REMOTE REASSESSMENTS- IN OUR ANALYSIS WE JUST FLAG THAT THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHETHER ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS FLEXIBILITIES MERIT- CONSIDERATION FOR AN EXTENSION. OR ALTERNATIVELY THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO CONSIDER WHETHER IT SHOULD DEVELOP GUIDANCE- AND RULES AROUND POSSIBLY MAINTAINING THESE FLEXIBILITIES THAT COULD THEN BE ACTIVATED- WITH ANY FUTURE COLBERT NINETEEN SEARCHES ARE JUST EMERGENCIES IN GENERAL LIKE. WILDFIRES IN CERTAIN REGIONS. I'M TO GET TO THE SECOND. IN THE AGENDA REGARDING THE CONTINUOUS COVERAGE ISSUE AS THE DEPARTMENT MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES ASSUME THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW THE STATE TO TEMPORARILY WAIVE OUR PA'S MEDICAL REDETERMINATION- THIS FLEXIBILITY HAS AND IT HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS. HOWEVER ONCE THIS FLEXIBILITY EXPIRES- THAT ESSENTIALLY MEANS THAT COUNTIES WILL BE REQUIRED NOT ONLY TO RESTART MEDIKAL REDETERMINATION BUT ALSO GO BACK AND PROCESS THOSE. FROM REDETERMINATION THE- FROM THE PAST TWO YEARS- SEWING COMPLETING THOSE REACH TERMINATIONS WE JUST KNOW NATURALLY SOME INDIVIDUALS MAY SUBMIT THEIR PAPERWORK AND WE MAY FIND THAT THERE ARE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE BASED OFF OF CERTAIN PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY RULES. HOWEVER WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME INDIVIDUALS THAT STILL MAY MEET MEDICAL G. BILITY ROLES. BUT JUST BECAUSE THEY FAIL TO COMPLETE THE PAPERWORK ON TIME AND SUBMIT IT. WILL BE TERMINATED FROM MEDIC CAL. I'M SO FOR THOSE I JUST AS RECIPIENTS WHOSE MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY DUE TO FAILURE TO COMPLETE THE MEDICAL REDETERMINATION PAPERWORK- TO ANSWER THE QUESTION IN THE AGENDA- SOME WAYS IN WHICH- THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER- PROVIDING SOME LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS COULD BE. PROVIDING MORE FRONTEND SERVICES WHEN IT COMES TO ON PROVIDING APPLET. REACH TERMINATION ASSISTANCE IN FILLING OUT THE PAPERWORK- BUT ALSO SOMETHING THAT WE FLAGGED AS THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER PROVIDING TEMPORARY I JUST AS BRIDGE SERVICES. THAT WOULD ALLOW- RECIPIENTS SOME TIME TO SUBMIT THE PAPERWORK- GET BACK ON MEDIC CAL AND THEN TRANSITION BACK TO THE FEDERALLY FUNDED I JUST AS PROGRAM IN THOSE BRIDGE SERVICES. I'M COULD BE OPERATED A COULD BE OFFERED THROUGH THE STATE ONLY I JUST AS PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE. OF COURSE BOTH OF THESE OPTIONS THERE WOULD BE COST CONSIDERATIONS BUT ALSO- ADMINISTRATIVE- COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVE IMPLICATIONS AS WELL THAT WOULD NEED TO BE THOUGHT THROUGH- BUT HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM KATHY SUNDERLAND WITH DONALD LET'S SEE WTF. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY IN PERSON TO TESTIFY KATHY CENTER LIMITADA LET'S SEE WTA. WE WERE ASKED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT COUNTY I TO ASSESS PROGRAMS ARE SEEING ON THE GROUND. AND I THINK IT DOES TRACK VERY MUCH TO WHAT YOU HEARD FROM THE DEPARTMENT AND FROM HIS BRO CO THAT WE SAW LOWER DEMAND DURING THE PANDEMIC NOT SURPRISINGLY- PEOPLE KIND OF HUNKERED DOWN. A LOT OF FOLKS WERE AT HOME AND WE JUST DID NOT SEE AS MANY APPLICATIONS COMING INTO THIS PROGRAM AS WE MAY HAVE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE CALFRESH PROGRAM WE DID SEE. QUITE A SPIKE THAT HAVE STARTED INCREASING BACK UP RECENTLY AS THINGS HAVE RE OPENED WE HAVE SEEN THAT IT'S ON UP TECH AND APPLICATIONS AND I KNOW THE STATE IS PROJECTING ABOUT A TWO AND A HALF 23% INCREASE. IN THE COMING YEAR THAT'S COMPARED TO MORE LIKE 526% HISTORICALLY WHICH IS MORE IN LINE WITH OUR- SORT OF AGING OF OUR POPULATION IS AROUND THAT FIVE TO SIX PERCENT. AS NOTED THAT IS ONLY PAID CASES SO THERE MAY BE MORE INDIVIDUALS COMING ON TO THE PROGRAM WHO IS NOT YET SECURED A PROVIDER AND WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT TO YOU- WE'RE NOT SURE OF COURSE THAT THIS IS MORE OF A SHORT TERM ISSUE WITH THAT PANDEMIC RELATED. IS IT- SORT OF BY PRODUCT WHAT MANY OF US ARE SEEING AND COUNTIES- AT THAT THE WORK FORCE HAS JUST CHANGED AT LEAST TEMPORARILY AND WHO IS AVAILABLE TO WORK IN THESE POSITIONS OR IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE ONGOING OR FOR OTHER REASONS. IT REALLY BEARS LOOKING AT THAT TOGETHER WE THINK WITH STAKEHOLDERS- THAT APARTMENT THE L. A. IT'S SATURDAY I'M TO TRY TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THAT THAT QUESTION. THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES- WE ARE ALSO FACING WORKFORCE ISSUES LOCALLY- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TURNOVER- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF BURN OUT. OF THERE IS DIFFICULTY HIRING RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEEING THAT TO AN COUNTIES JUST AS EVERYONE IS- AND SO WE DO APPRECIATE THE- THAT WE'VE HAD. AROUND OUTCOMES AND SORT OF OUR QUALITY WITH THE- THE STATE WE KNOW AT SOME POINT OBVIOUSLY. THINGS ARE GOING TO GET GOING AGAIN BUT NOT HAVING ENOUGH STAFF IS CERTAINLY GOING TO. AFFECT THE OUTCOME MEASURES WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE KNOW THE STATE KNOWS THAT AS WELL CALLIE'S ARE TRYING I MEAN OUR STAFF THAT WE DO HAVE ARE TRYING. AS HARD AS THEY CAN. AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS THE FLEXIBILITIES- WE WERE ASKED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. I WOULD SAY I'M PRETTY MUCH ANY AND ALL OF THE ONES THAT ARE LISTED IN YOUR AGENDA. WE SUPPORT AND WOULD REALLY LOVE TO SEE CONTINUE. SPECIFICALLY USE SELF ATTESTATION WHEREVER POSSIBLE DOING ASSESSMENTS OR REASSESSMENTS- WHATEVER COULD BE DONE VIRTUALLY WHETHER THAT IN PERSON THAT DOES. NOT ONLY KEEP PEOPLE SAFE AS WE KNOW COVERT HAS NOT DISAPPEARED IN THE POPULATION WE WORK WITH. IS AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION- EVEN STILL THAT ALSO SAVES TIME OF COURSE AS WELL FOR STAFF THEY MAY BE ABLE TO DO. MORE OF THOSE IN A DAY OR A WEEK THAN IF THEY WERE TRAVELING. TO PEOPLE'S HOMES- OF COURSE THERE MAY BE TIMES AND BEING IN PERSON MAKES THE MOST SENSE AND SO WE WOULD WANT TO- THINK THROUGH THAT WITH THAT WITH THE DEPARTMENT. AS WELL- BEING ABLE TO SUBMIT FORMS VIRTUALLY OR BY MAIL OR FAX RATHER THAN HAVING TO COME. TO THE OFFICE TO SUBMIT THEM IN PERSON TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE WE SAW THAT IS VERY USEFUL AND- DON'T REALLY SEE MUCH OF A NEED TAKEN. YOU KNOW KIND OF GET BACK TO THAT IN PERSON SUBMISSION- PEOPLE ARE I THINK USED TO DOING. PROVIDER PROCESS WERE VERY INTERESTED IN THAT OF COURSE- WE AGREE WITH MR LETS YOU KNOW THAT THEIR BEEN PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS. THERE WAS A MEETING JUST YESTERDAY THAT I HAD STAFF AT. AND WE'RE WORKING WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE UNIONS WITH CAP OTHER EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR IS HERE- I WILL NOTE THAT SOME QUESTIONS AROUND ENSURING. SUFFICIENT ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDS FOR THE COUNTIES- WERE NOT AWASH IN FUNDING SO MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE DOING A GOOD JOB WITH THE STATE OF. ESTIMATING THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ON OUR END WOULD BE HELPFUL AS WELL THINKING ABOUT THE START DATE WE WOULD WANT THIS TO WORK WHILE. AND CURRENTLY I BELIEVE- THE- PROPOSED STATE IS- AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR THE STARTOF THE NEW FISCAL YEAR- WERE SUGGESTING YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER. SCOOTING THAT OUT JUST A FEW MONTHS PERHAPS EXTENDING WHAT WE HAVE NOW WHICH THERE IS A BACK UP SYSTEM NOW IT'S JUST NOT SORT OF THE ON GOING- IDEAL SYSTEM. IF IT TURNS OUT THAT IT TAKES US ALL A LITTLE WHILE THE KIND OF LAND. THE PLANE OF THE LANGUAGE AND GET EVERYTHING- PUT TOGETHER FOR THE ON GOING. THE OTHER THING WILL I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION IS JUST- WE ARE PROPOSING. A NEW ASSESSMENT PROCESS OF REASSESSMENT PROCESS. THAT SORT OF BUILDS ON WHAT'S CALLED VARIABLE REASSESSMENTS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS CREATED. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR BUT IS ONLY AVAILABLE FOR A LIMITED- SET OF R. I. H. SETH RECIPIENTS. THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE RECIPIENTS WHO ARE STABLE HAVE VERY LITTLE CHANGE IN THEIR HEALTH CONDITION AND THERE'S VERY LITTLE CHANGE N THEIR HOURS FROM YEAR TO YEAR. AND SO- WE THINK THAT BEING ABLE TO DO MORE OF A PAPER BASED ASSESSMENT. FOR THEM FOR SAY TWO YEARS AND THEN DOING A FACE TO FACE IN THAT THIRD YEAR WOULD MAKE SENSE- WE- I HAVE LEGISLATION THAT WERE WORKING ON- AB TWENTY TWO SIXTY TWO. ON THE OR CO SPONSORING WITH JUSTICE IN AGING THAT WOULD DO THIS AND- WE THINK THAT IT WOULD HELP. SORT OF IN THE VEIN AS WELL AS THE OTHER FLEXIBILITIES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. INSURE THAT WERE ABLE TO FOCUS THE LIMITED SOCIAL WORKER. TIME ON CASES THAT ARE VARIABLE FROM YEAR TO YEAR NEW PEOPLE COMING IN THAT WE REALLY NEED TO FIGURE OUT KIND OF WHAT'S GOING ON OR WHAT DO THEY NEED. AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS SO THAT'S WHERE THAT PROPOSAL COMES FROM. THANK YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM TIFFANY WHITEN WITH THIS YEAR YOU. THANK YOU. ANYWAY WITH AS A YOUTH CAL. THING YOU CHAIR. DA LEADING. I FOR THE APP. TO WITH THE- WE REPRESENT NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND LONG TERM CARE WORKERS REPRESENTED BY SEIU LOCAL TWENTY FIFTEEN. I WAS GIVEN TO QUESTIONS THE ANSWERS I'LL JUST JUMP RIGHT INTO THOSE THE FIRST QUESTION IS HOW CAN THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION. ENSURE THAT THE AGE OF SAYS CAREER PATHWAYS PROGRAM IS SUCCESSFUL FOR EXISTINGAND FUTURE- PROVIDERS. FIRST WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO UPLIFT AND INVEST IN THE HSS WORKFORCE AND IN THE CARE THAT THEY DELIVER TO THEIR CONSUMERS WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP WITH DIRECTOR JOHNSON AND HER TEAM. TO DISCUSS THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE- LEGISLATURE IN THIS COMMITTEE. TO ENSURE SUCCESS WE BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO FIRST MEET THE PROVIDER WHERE THEY'RE AT. I JUST AS PROVIDERS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR IMMIGRANTS. OLDER THAN THE WORKING AGE POPULATION AT LARGE AND HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION OR LESS. ANY TRAINING PROGRAM MUST RECOGNIZE THIS AND ADDRESS THE STRUCTURAL BARRIERS AND INEQUITIES MANY I. HSS PROVIDERS SPACE. THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE MODELED ON EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES THAT FOSTER EQUITY AND ACCESS AND PROMOTE LEARNING RETENTION AND ADVANCEMENT AMONG ADULT LEARNERS. THE PROGRAM WILL UTILIZE AN ONLINE PROGRAM WHICH THERE IS A NEED FOR HOWEVER WE WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE THE OPTION FOR IN PERSON TRAINING AND CLASSES. AS WELL AS A HYBRID APPROACH WE KNOW ALL COUNTIES ARE NOT THE SAME AND IN SOME AREAS ACCESS TO THE INTERNET CAN BE DIFFICULT SO ENSURING TECHNOLOGY AND INTERNET CAPABILITIES. ARE ASSESSABLE AS WELL AS A PHYSICAL SITE ARE ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS. WE WILL EACH PATHWAY SHOULD HAVE LEVELS OR MULTIPLE CLASSES WITH IN IT. EACH STEPS ALLOWED FOR SKILL AND KNOWLEDGE PROGRESSION. BY GIVEN THE PROVIDERS A ROBUST TRAINING PROGRAM WITH STACKABLE CREDENTIALS ALLOWS PROVIDERS TO MOVE ALONG THE CAREER LADDER. AS WAYS OF ADVANCEMENT OUTSIDE OF THE MORE TRADITIONAL COLLEGE PATHWAYS. IN ADDITION WE BELIEVE- RESTRICTED THE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS FOR THE SPECIALIZED CAREER PATHWAY TO ONLY PROVIDERS WHO TAKE ON A NEW CLIENT. ACTUALLY CREATES PERVERSE INCENTIVES SUCH AS GREATER TURN OVER. THE BENEFITS OF A TRAINED I HSS PROVIDER EXTENSIVE BOTH NEW AND EXISTING CONSUMERS. THIS PROGRAM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO MAKE A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE FOR BOTH. PROVIDERS AND CONSUMERS AND WE ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO DISCUSS AS WE ALL HAVE THE HAVE THE COMMON GOAL TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM A SUCCESS. AND ADVANCE HIGH QUALITY HOME CARE JOBS TO DELIVER THE BEST CARE AS POSSIBLE TO THE CONSUMERS. THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHAT- CHANGES WOULD FURTHER SUPPORT HSS PROVIDERS IN ADDITION TO HAVING A HIGH QUALITY HOME CARE JOB PROVIDERS ALSO NEED RETIREMENT SECURITY. CAL SAVERS AS YOU KNOW IS A RETIREMENT PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT THAT DO NOT HAVE AUTOMATIC EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT OPTIONS SUCH AS R. I. HSS PROVIDERS. THE PROGRAM GETS PROVIDERS THE ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS AND THEY CAN OPT IN OR OUT OF THE PROGRAM AS DESIRED. CURRENTLY I HSS PROVIDERS HAVE TO SELF AND ROLL INTO THE PROGRAM AND MANUALLY MAKE THEIR-PAYMENTS EACH MONTH BECAUSE THERE ARE NO AUTOMATIC DEDUCTIONS. JOINTLY WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALDERON- WE PROPOSE TO ALLOCATE THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME- FUNDING TO REPROGRAM SIEMENS THE AGE OF SETS A PAPERLESS SYSTEM. TO DO AUTOMATIC PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS FOR PROVIDERS THAT CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CALIPHATE THIS PROGRAM THIS AUTOMATIC DEDUCTION IS IMPORTANT TO IMPLEMENT AS THERE WILL BE A STEP AND HAVING MORE I HSS PROVIDERS IN ROLE IN THE CALIPHATE FIRST PROGRAM AND ULTIMATELY. TO HAVE RETIREMENT SECURITY IT'S A MODEST APPROPRIATION WITH THE HUGE IMPACT AND WILL GO A LONG WAY TO FURTHER SUPPORT AGES AS PROVIDERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY. THANK YOU NEXT WE WILL HEAR FROM BEVERLY YOU WITH ASKED ME LOCAL THIRTY NINE THIRTY. MISTER CHAIRMAN. REALLY YOU ON BEHALF OF THE LOCAL THREE NINE THIRTY. WE REPRESENT A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND MEMBERS STATEWIDE. THANK YOU FOR THE HEARING TO BE APPRECIATE THAT ACCOMMODATION TO TESTIFY REMOTELY WITH THE QUESTIONS TODAY. BURKE WHAT ARE SOME PARAMETER THE STATION CONSIDER THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ISIS THAT'S OF THE PCS FROM THE BACKUP SYSTEM. IN CREATING A FRAMEWORK FOR CORNERBACK SYSTEM HE W. S. YEAH YOU URGE CONSIDER THE BACK OF SYSTEM A MINIMUM OF A TWO DOLLAR WASTE A FACTUAL THIS PROVISION MUST BE EXPLICITLY LAID OUT ESPECIALLY TO PREVENT A DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS. THE SECOND CONSIDERATIONS THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE LANGUAGE THAT LIMITS CONTRACTORS EXISTING CONTRACT. VOTE SENATE. ANY CONTRACT LOW NEED TO BE WITH THE- STATES LET'S LOOK. I PROCESS THAT SCHOOL BY SECTOR THESE OUR BEING BY A FACTOR PROVIDER ICE OUR- THE TO BE. BY WORKER THIS IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE OF CARE IS PROVIDED I SUFFER. IS ALSO SET STANDARDS FOR CONTRACTORS TO ENSURE THAT THE OPERATE ABOVE BOARD IT'S A GOOD ACTORS WHO ISN'T PUTTING PROFIT. ABOVE PAYING THEIR WORKERS ASKED WE HAVE SEEN SO FREQUENTLY IN THE GIG ECONOMY. WE LOOK FORWARD TO MORE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE SS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. ON THE PROVIDER CONSISTENT. SECOND CLASS. HOW CAN THE STATE'S. NOW OUT PREPARED AND RISK THIS I TO MESSED UP. PROVIDERS MISSISSIPPI GROUP CHAMPION SIMPLY SANTIAGO IMPROVE PREPAREDNESS RESPONSE LIGHT PROGRAM. CURRENTLY OVER FIVE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND I JUST AS PROVIDERS OVERSEE HUNDRED THOUSAND. IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO GEOLOGIC CONDITIONS AND CLIMATE CHANGE WE EXPECT TO SEE EARTHQUAKES LONGER FIRE SEASONS INTENSE WINTER STORMS AN OVERALL INCREASE IN NATURAL DISASTERS. DURING NATIONAL DISASTERS OLDER ADULTS INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES ESPECIALLY THOSE LIMITED RESOURCES LIKE MANY OF OUR ISIS CLIENTS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LEFT BEHIND. THIS WORK IS WHAT TO INDIVIDUAL CARE HEALTH OF FROM NATURAL DISASTER ALSO WORSEN INDIVIDUALS HEALTH CONDITIONS AND THEY ARE NOT FACT WE DIDN'T FIND AND PROVIDED CONTINUITY OF CARE. DURING NATURAL DISASTERS I JUST AS PROVIDERS ARE MANY CASES THE ONLY INDIVIDUALS WHO KNOW THEIR CLIENTS NEEDS AND LOCATION. AND ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO GO CHECK ON THEIR CLIENTS HOLDEN BACKING AWAY AND PROVIDE CARE CLIENTS ARE DISPLACED. I JUST PROVIDERS ARE GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND THE TYPICAL CALL FOR CARE TO ENSURE THEIR CLIENTS ARE HEALTHY AND SAFE. FOR EXAMPLE MANY PROVIDERS THAT WE'RE GOING TO ACTIVE FIRE ZONES TO HELP THE FACT THAT YOUR CLIENTS. EARLY MAKING ALLEN FIND JUST THE CLOTHES ON THEIR BACK AND NECESSARY MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. PROVIDERS ARE TRAVELING WITH THEIR CLIENTS IN YOUR SHELTER OR METALLIC PROVIDING CARE IN A COMPLETELY NEW LOCATIONAL. DURING AFTER DISASTERS ARE PROVIDERS MUST BE RESTORED TO THE SET UP FOR CARE TRYING TO MAKE INTEREST MEALS GOING TO DONATION CENTERS GET SUPPLIES. ONLY ON BEHALF OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR CLIENTS FOR FOOD STAMPS HOUSING. VOUCHERS AND GAS CARTS TO GET AROUND. I LOCATION TO PAYCHECK COVER THE CHILD. BY OUT OF FOR SICKNESS. TO SURVIVE. IN A PROVIDERS NOT WAIT FOR THE CLIENTS TO GET THEIR OUR SUCCESS AND KEYBOARD BECAUSE THERE SIMPLY ISN'T THE LUXURY OF TIME MUCH AS THE RESPONSIBLE PARENT IS UNDER THE ISIS PROGRAM. IS NOT SUFFICIENT ENSURING THE SAFETY OF BOTH HOME CARE PROVIDER FOR THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THEY SERVE. COUNTY OFFICES ARE OFTEN SHUT DOWN THE PHONE LINES ARE JAMMED YOUR EMERGENCY LEADING RECIPIENTS RIGHT COMPLETELY UNDER ISIS PROVIDERS. THIS IS A CONSIDERALE BURDEN FOR BY THE MOBILE WORKFORCE MADE UP PREDOMINATELY. COLOR WE HAVE A VERY MODEST PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU. CAME PROVIDER A MINIMUM OF A TWO DOLLAR BASED DIFFERENTIAL FOR FORTY OF A CLIENT SUCCESS HOURS DURING A DECLARED STATE OF NATURAL DISASTER COUNTY. THIS IS JUST HOPEFULLY A STARTING POINT WE URGE MORE TO BE DONE FEARFUL TO WORK WITH THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. TO HELP OUR PROVIDERS ON A CLIENT'S OUT DURING TIMES OF EXTRAORDINARY MEET INCREASING OPPORTUNITY COMMENT TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE WORK THE LEGISLATURE STATION YES ASKING ALL STAKEHOLDERS DURING. THIS BUDGET PROCESS. THANK YOU. THE YOU NOT WELL HEAR A LIVE. SIR WITH THIS RIGHTS. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON- I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S TIME TODAY AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE OUR COMMENTS WEWILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH DETAILED WRITTEN RESPONSES TO SUPPORT MY TESTIMONY TODAY. SO IN ADDITION TO BEER SKEWS COMMENTS ON THE BACK OF PROVIDERS SYSTEM IN CAREER PATHWAYS I WANT TO FIRST ADDRESS THE CONCERNS WE HAVE WITH THE LABOR CODE CHANGES FURTHER DEFINING THE IRISH ASSASSIN BLOW YOUR COMPLAINT RELATIONSHIP. CDSS IS AWARE OF OUR STRONG OBJECTION TO THIS LANGUAGE WHICH WE FEEL IS AN UNNECESSARY IMPOSING LIABILITY ON I JUST AS CONSUMERS FOR COUNTLESS UNKNOWN ISSUE. AS NOTED BY THE TVL IT APPLIES TO ALL PROVISIONS OF STATE LAW OUTSIDE OF THE WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE AND CAN INVOLVE SERIOUS CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LIABILITIES. CURRENT GUIDANCE I JUST SAYS CONSUMERS REGARDING OBLIGATIONS TO THEIR AYE TO SUCH PROVIDERS DOES NOT INCLUDE INFORMATION ON A WIDE RANGE OF EMPLOYMENT RELATED LEGAL RSPONSIBILITIES THAT WILL BE IMPOSED BY THIS TIME. IF INDEED THIS IS NECESSARY AT SOME POINT IT CANNOT BE PUSHED THROUGH WITHOUT CAREFUL ANALYSIS AND SIGNIFICANT INVOLVEMENT OF STAKEHOLDERS. AND IMPACTED CONSUMERS. BACK UP. AS WE HAVE. THE INCREASE FUNDING. AT THE PUMP. I JUST AS BACKUP SYSTEM. OUR PRIMARY. CONCERN ARE ENSURING IS A- THAT. GETS PEOPLE THE BACK PROVIDER SERVICES THAT THEY NEED INCLUDING ON WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS. YES ASKED WHICH INCLUDE THERE'S NO DEFINITION OF URGENT WHICH MAY CAUSE CONFUSION ABOUT WHEN SOMEONE IS ENTITLED TO A BACKUP PROVIDER. THE BACKUP PROVIDER SYSTEM SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE TRANSITIONING FROM FACILITIES YOU MAY NOT YET HAVE A REGULAR PROVIDER. I NEED FOR AN EXCEPTION TO THE EIGHTY HOUR CAP PER YEAR. AND PROBLEMS WITH HOW THE WORK WEEK EXEMPTION WILL BE RATES WAIT. I'M IN ADDITION WE BELIEVE THAT ANY PROPOSED REQUIREMENTS FIRST USING I JUST SENSE REGISTRY ONE ACCOUNT EUROPEAN I CAN USE THAT CONTRACT MODE FOR BACKUP BUYERS MUST NOT HAVE EFFECTIVELY MADE ACCESS FOR CONSUMERS TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED. WE THINK A WAGE DIFFERENTIAL WILL. HELP IMPROVE ACCESS. PORT APPLE. THE FOCUS OF THE BACKUP SYSTEM SHOULD BE TO ENSURE ACCESS TO CARE AND TO AVOID INSTITUTIONALIZATION. IN TERMS OF THE CAREER PATH WE PROVIDED WRITTEN THAT'S JUST A GUESS HI MARK IN ADDITION TO ENSURING WAX SAYS CONSUMER PROTESTED IT LIMITATION OF THE SPECIALIZED SKILL PATHWAYS TO PROVIDERS WHO WORK WITH NEW PARTICIPANTS WE READ THAT LANGUAGE IN THE STATUTE TO BE BROADER AND ARE CONCERNED THAT PARENT AND FAMILY MEMBER PROVIDERS MAY BE PRECLUDED FROM ADDITIONAL TRAINING. AND COMPENSATION OPPORTUNITIES. AS THE PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED. PLEASE ME TO MY FINAL COMMENTS REGARDING ACCESS ISSUES AND I JUST SAT. EVEN THE SHORTAGES IN PROVIDERS WHICH WE HOPE CAN BE ALLEVIATED BY BOTH THE BACKUP PROVIDER SYSTEM AND CAREER PATHWAYS PROGRAM WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS WE HOPE TO SEE D. R. C. RECOMMENDS THAT CDSS REMOVE BARRIERS TO FAMILY MEMBER PROVIDERS SPECIFICALLY IN RULES RELATED TO PARENTS AND ABLE APPEAL AND AVAILABLE SPOUSES WHICH ROUTINELY MAKE ACCESSING I JUST SAT SERVICES EXTREMELY COMPLICATED. AND GO BEYOND WHAT IS REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL MEDICAID LAW FOR EXAMPLE CURRENTLY CHILDREN FOR I JUST SAYS ELIGIBLE BUT DO NOT HAVE A PARENT WAS LEGAL STATUS TO BE AND I JUST PROVIDER FROM THEM ARE UNABLE TO RECEIVE I JUST SENSEFROM A LONG TERM PROVIDER IN CERTAIN SCENARIOS BECAUSE OF THE WAY CARE PROVIDER WILLS ARE WRITTEN. THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS SHOWN HOW IMPORTANT FAMILY MEMBER PROVIDERS ARE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY MAKING THE PROCESS OF GETTING I JUST THAT SERVICES SERVICES SIMPLER AND MORE ACCESSIBLE IS CRITICAL. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE. IN THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. THANK YOU WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT UP THE DIET I WILL IT HE- AT THE CHAIR. I'M GONNA ASK MY FIRST QUESTION- OF- DIRECTOR JOHNSON IF I CAN I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD'S QUESTION ON PANDEMIC FLEXIBILITIES. SHE HAD STATED- A DESIRE TO HAVE ANY AND ALL FLEXIBILITY IS EXTENDED BEYOND THIS. PANDEMIC THAT I WAS HOPING TO HEAR FROM YOU DIRECTOR WHICH- FLEXIBILITIES YOU WERE LOOKING TO CONTINUE TO EXTEND BEYOND THE PANDEMIC AND IF THERE WERE ANY THAT YOU WERE. NOT GOING TO BE CONTINUING. SURE THANK YOU CHAIR FOR THAT QUESTION AND AT REALLY APPRECIATE THE LIFTING HAPPENED AGAIN THE QUICK WORK OF ALL PARTNERS AT TOP ORIGINAL IS THE MANY FLEXIBILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY RESOURCES WE WERE ABLE. TO WORK ON TOGETHER WE ARE RIGHT IN THE MIDST AT THAT PROCESS TO HAVE A SET THAT STANDARD WITH DONALD'S POINT AROUND OUR WHAT WE AGAIN HAVE WARRANTED WHERE. THERE'S POTENTIAL FOR THE NEED OF THESE FLEXIBILITIES IN THE FUTURE WE ARE AT CERTAINLY LOOKING AT THAT AT TODAY IN TERMS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO CONTINUEON- I APPRECIATE THAT YOUR AGENDA OUTLINES THAT THE DATES BY WHICH SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITIES HAVE EXPIRED AND SOME THAT WILL EXPIRE AT THE END OF. THAT PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY- I THINK THAT AT THE AS WAS NOTED THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE CERTAIN INSTANCES AND TIMES WHERE BEING IN PERSON MATTERS. IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT THOSE ESPECIALLY THE INITIAL ASSESSMENTS ARE ARE ARE DONE IN A WAY THAT IS SUPPORTING AND GIVING TIME AND SPACE. ADD TO ENSURE THAT THAT RECIPIENTS RECEIVING ALL OF THE CARE THAT THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN STAYING HOME SO. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THAT CERTAINLY WE HAVE HAD SOME THAT EXPIRES THAT'S KIND OF THAT I GUESS THE ORIGINAL THAT THE FIRST PIECE OF YOUR QUESTION THAT'S THE ANSWER THERE BUT- IN TERMS OF THOSE THAT ARE CONTINUING INTO IN IN TERMS THAT THEY NEED TO LOOK FURTHER DOWN THE LINE. AB AS TO WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE THE NEED FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY IN THE FUTURE WE ARE. GLAD TO CONTINUE EXPLORING AND HAVING THAT CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD. I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT TIE- ALWAYS THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY'RE OUT TO DO SO THE MORE FLEXIBILITY AS WE CAN GIVE WILL ALLOW US TO DO JUST THAT- I WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON MRS WORKERS COMMENT WITH DRC REGARDING. THE I. HSS EMPLOYER. TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE AND- THIS WE JUST NEED TO BE TRANSPARENT ABOUT IT BUT AFTER HEARING THE TESTIMONY WE HEARD TODAY IT IS UNCLEAR TO ME WHY THIS TRAILER BILL IS NEEDED- IF THE ADMINISTRATION ASSERTS THAT IT IS THEN I WANT TO URGE THE GOVERNOR TO PURSUE THE POLICY PROCESS FOR THIS PIECE SO THAT IT CAN BENEFIT FROM THE REVIEW FROM BOTH THE HUMAN SERVICES POLICY COMMITTEE AND POTENTIALLY THE JUDICIARY AND LABOR COMMITTEES AS WELL- I. WANNA JUST BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT WE HEARD AND THE CONCERNS FROM D. R. C. I TAKE THOSE QUITE SERIOUSLY AND- WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO CONVEY THAT TO YOU HERE TODAY- I WILL ASK MY NEXT QUESTION OF THE PERMANENT BACKUP PROVIDER SYSTEM AND WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON- WHAT MISS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT REGARDING THE START DATE- AS WELL AS I THINK BEVERLY YOU HAD- I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE TIMING AND AGAIN. PURSUANT TO THE TRAILER BILL THAT WE ARE WORKING TO RESOLVE HOW ARE WE GONNA MEET THIS ENVISIONS JULY FIRST DATE WHAT ARE THE ADMINISTRATION'S THOUGHTS ON THE TIMING GIVEN THE NUMBER OF ISSUES AND CONCERNS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AND RESOLVED IN THIS TRAILER BILL AND THE PRACTICALITIES OF OPERATIONALIZE IN ALL OF THIS TIMELY DO WE NEED TO CONSIDER A LEADER IMPLEMENTATION DATES TO ASSURE THAT THIS LAUNCHES APPROPRIATELY WHAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO EXTEND THE CURRENT BACKUP SYSTEM IF MORE TIME IS NEEDED. AND SO I GUESS I'LL TAKE THAT UP SO I THINK WE'RE VERY HAPPY TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS IT THIS WAS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS BROUGHT UP DURING OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS AND WITH- THE COUNTIES IN PARTICULAR- I WOULD. PREFER TO MY FINANCE COLLEAGUES BECAUSE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY GOING TO BE SOME UP BUDGET CONCERNS WITH REGARD TO EXTENDING IT BEYOND THE CURRENT- DEADLINE- SO I WOULD. LIKE TO FOR- FOR SURE ON THAT. NONCONFORMING OPINIONS I THINK OUR INITIAL THOUGHTS IS BECAUSE SOME OF THESE CONVERSATIONS WERE HAD LOTS BUDGET CYCLE THAT WE'D BE ABLE TO REACH A CONSENSUS ON. WITHIN THAT TIME FRAME ON EXTENDING THE CURRENT SYSTEM THROUGH THE END OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR WHEN ENSURE THAT THERE WASN'T A GAP IN THE SERVICES BUT AGAIN. HAVING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS AND TAKE THAT BACK. LOOK FORWARD TO THAT HEARING THE TESTIMONY AGAIN TODAY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE A BACKUP PLAN IF WE'RE NOT READY BY THE FIRST OF JULY AND- I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO. BE WORKING TO INSURE THAT WE HAVE ONE OR THE OTHER. I'M WITH THAT I'M NOW GOING TO TURN TO CONTINUOUS COVERAGE- I KNOW THIS IS AN ISSUE WE'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ON BEFORE BUT I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW WE ARE ABLE TO AVOID INAPPROPRIATE TERMINATIONS FROM THE MEDIKAL AND IHS US FOR THE COMPROMISED POPULATIONS ONCE THE RE DETERMINATIONS DO BEGAN ON THE FIRST OF JULY OF THIS YEAR. OR IF IT'S ANOTHER TIME LATER WHAT ARE WE DOING AS A STATE IN ADVANCE TO ENSURE THAT CONSUMERS DON'T FACE A LOSS OF SERVICES. I'M HEARD SOME HERE TODAY BUT REALLY WANT U TO DIG IN A LITTLE MORE IF I CAN- I. HAVE THIS CONCERN BECAUSE I WANT TO ENSURE THAT WERE VERY ACTIVELY ENGAGED ACROSS ALL OF OUR DEPARTMENTS TO AVOID THE UNNECESSARY STRESS THE TURMOIL AND THE OTHER NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES IF WE DO NOT COORDINATE SIMPLIFY AND EXECUTE WHATEVER IS IN OUR POWER AS A STATE TO FACILITATE THIS CONTINUOUS COVERAGE FOR SENIORS. AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND% NEED WHAT ROLE WILL OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCY. LAY AND PLANNING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU CHAIRED BY QUITE EXPAND A LITTLE BIT AND I JUST WANT TO SAY TO YOU THAT WE SHARE. THE SAME CONCERN THAT AS THE CONFUSION AROUND AT HAVING THE ABILITY TO PAUSE BUT NOT THIS TIME IT REALLY ENSURING THAT EVERY AT PARTICIPATE UNDERSTANDS THAT WE DO NEED THEM TO COMPLETE. THIS PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE FOR THOSE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE IS CERTAINLY A KEY PRIORITY FOR US AS WELL I THINK SOME OF THAT RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND SIMPLIFICATION WAYS IF AT ALL WE CAN BE LOOKING TOWARD SOLUTIONS THAT CAN PRE POPULATE INFORMATION SIMPLIFIED TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN- ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT IT REALLY DO RECOGNIZE- THE ULTIMATE DESIRE TO CONTINUE SERVICES TO NOT DISRUPT SERVICES. TO ANYONE WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THEM SO I WOULD JUST IN THE HOPE THAT AS AS WAS MENTIONED AS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS LOOKING AT A MEMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES AT WITH THE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SIMPLIFY SOME OF THESE PROCESSES WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK AS WAS MENTIONED WITH. ALL ANY AND ALL OF OUR PARTNERS AND THOSE WHO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH AT THE AT A BENEFICIARY TO ENSURE THAT WE ALL HAVE THAT CONSISTENT MESSAGING AND UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS AND TIME LINES FOR THAT BUT I JUST WANT TO HOLD SUMMIT LEAGUE EXPRESS. THAT IT IS TO A PRIORITY FOR US ADD TO ENSURE THERE'S NO DISCONTINUITY AS. THAT CONTINUE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM. MISSPELLED ENOM TO BRING YOU IN HERE WELL AND I WILL REALLY- MOVED WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PERMANENT PROVIDER BACK UP HOW YOU SPOKE ABOUT HOW WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT- WE RECEIVE SUPPORTS THAT OUR COMMUNITY NEEDS I. IN THAT SAME VEIN WANT TO MAKE SURE WITH CONTINUOUS COVERAGE THAT PER PROVIDING THE SUPPORTS THAT OUR COMMUNITY NEEDS- HE YOU WENT THROUGH A NUMBER OF WAYS IN WHICH WE WILL BE DOING OUTREACH TOWARDS COUNTIES AND- COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO HELP US TO COMPLETE THIS. BUT IT IT IT SEEMS AS IF WE WILL HAVE SOME PEOPLE WHO WILL FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS WITH THIS. HOW HOW CAN WE HAVE A GRACE PERIOD OR HOW CAN WE ENSURE- THAT THOSE WHO MIGHT NOT FULLY COMPLETE THEIR REDETERMINATION IS ON TIME ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE THE SUPPORTS THAT THEY NEED. SO AS- SKILL ALLUDED TO- WE DO HAVE A SOMEWHAT OF A SAFETY NET FOR I JUST THAT WAS THAT SO WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN ON THE FRONT END. USE ALL OF OUR COMMUNICATION METHODS THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM. LOSING THEIR MEDICAID. HOWEVER IF SOMEBODY HAS LOSE THEIR MEDICAL BECAUSE THEY DID NOT COMPLETE THEIR REDETERMINATION BUT ACTUALLY-FALL INTO THE RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM. AND AT THAT POINT- OUR CHILDREN'S SOCIAL WORKER FOR I JUST SENSE REALLY. IS A BIG PART OF WORKING WITH THAT INDIVIDUAL AND MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY TO REESTABLISH THAT PERSON'S ELIGIBILITY AND GET MAKE SURE THAT THEY CONTINUE WITH THEIR SERVICES SO THAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO CHANGE. IS THAT THE REDETERMINATION ASSISTANCE- THAT WAS MENTIONED OR IS THAT THE TEMPORARY I. HSS BRIDGE SERVICES. AND DO EITHER OF THOSE PROGRAMS NEED TO BE SUPPORTED AS. WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS TRANSITION. SO THAT IS THE SO THE I US RESIDUAL PROGRAM IS- WHAT WAS ALLUDED TO AS THE TEMPORARY BRIDGE SERVICES OF THOSE ALREADY EXIST TODAY- THEY ARE STATE ONLY FUNDED. AS MS BROOKS HILLS ALLUDED TO AS WELL- SO THAT EXISTS TODAY AS WELL AS I BELIEVE SHE WAS ALSO SPEAKING ON GIVING SOME SUPPORT TO COUNTIES. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE WELL FOR SOMEBODY LOSES THEIR MEDICAL AND THAT WOULD REALLY BE ON THE L. AT THE MEDICAL ELIGIBILITY SIDE. NOT SO MUCH ON THE IHS SIDE FOR US WE RECEIVED INFORMATION AFTER ALL OF THE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN ON THE MEDICAL SIDE SO THIS IS REALLY- UP PROCESS THAT'S OWNED BY R. T. H. U. R. NURSE. M. AND SO THAT'S KIND OF WHAT THE WAY IT WORKS FOR US. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF I MIGHT KATHY SANDERLING CPA- YOU KNOW WE DO MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY TO SIDE WEARING A COUPLE HATS HERE- SO. A COUPLE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT WHAT THE H. C. S. R. THE NEED TO ENSURE THAT CONTACT INFORMATION IS UPDATED. BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS WE DIDN'T ACTUALLY STOP THE REDETERMINATION PROCESS PEOPLE THINK WE DID BUT IN FACT ON OUR COMPUTER SYSTEMS CONTINUE TO TRY. TO RENEW PEOPLE AUTOMATICALLY IN AN EX PARTE WAY END SEND PACKETS TO PEOPLE THEY WERE JUST TOLD DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE PACKETS YOU'RE FINE DON'T SEND THEM BACK. THERE WAS CONFUSION AROUND THIS IT WAS NOT IDEAL BUT IT NEVER STOPPED AND SO THERE'S COMMUNICATION THE NEEDS TO HAPPEN I THINK BOTH TO SAY OKAY NOW IT'S FOR REAL YOU ACTUALLY DO HAVE TO SEND THIS BACK. IF WE'RE NOT ABLE TO DO IT AUTOMATICALLY AND SEND THE PACKET OUT BUT ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THAT CONTACT INFORMATION IS UPDATED SO THAT KIND OF JUST GOT ME THINKING HERE- AND- KIND OF MADE EYES AT THAT BOB IS WHITE IN HERE- PERHAPS WE COULD THINK ABOUT IN ADDITION. TO COUNTY I JUST SAYS ALSO THE THING ABOUT TO USE THE- NOW AND- PROVIDERS. HOW AN INTEREST IN SERVING THEIR- WHICH EITHER FAMILY OF COURSE AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO WORK BECAUSE THAT IS THEIR JOB. SO THERE'S SORT OF MULTIPLE REASONS WHY YOU COULD THINK THAT MAY BE WORKING WITH THE UNIONS AND KAPPA POTENTIALLY STARTED TO YOU INTO THE- OF MISTRUST CHILD BUT- MAYBE THERE'S SOME THINGS WE COULD DO HERE TO DO SOME COMMUNICATION WORK. IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS- SINCE WE DON'T A GOING TO HAPPEN. THAT THE STATE IS SUPPOSED TO GET A SIXTY DAY NOTICE SOMEONE THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT MINIMUM. AND SO WE HAVEN'T GOT IT YET SO IT'S AT LEAST. TWO MONTHS FROM NOW IT COULD BE LONGER I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING IT'S GOING TO BE YOU KNOW SOMETIME DURING THE SUMMER. AND THEN I'LL JUST MENTION IF IT'S ALL RIGHT THE STATE'S ARE BEING GIVEN- BETWEEN TWELVE AND FOURTEEN MONTHS TO DO THE REDETERMINATION WORK- THE WAY IN WHICH WE'VE DISCUSSED WITH THE- YES IS. THAT WE WILL- BASICALLY JUST KEEP PEOPLE ON THEIR SCHEDULE SO YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW PEOPLE WHO ARE IN JUNE OR JULY WE WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN STARTING THE PROCESS FOR THEM. AND SO THOSE FOLKS THEY WON'T BE DUE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE- WILL SORT OF WANTS THAT- THAT TWELVE MONTH PERIOD KICKS IN- IT'LL BE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ABOUT. TWO TO THREE MONTHS OUT WHO WOULD BE WE'D RUN THAT EX PARTE PROCESS THEN THEY WILL GET THE PACK IT WITH PLENTY OF TIME TO SEND IT BACK IN. AND SO FORTH SO- WE HAVE THAT WHOLE TIME- THE TWELVE MONTHS IS TO INITIATE AND THE FOURTEEN MONTH SAYS TO COMPLETE THE KNOWING THAT IT'S A PROCESS THAT TAKES A LITTLE TIME. SO IT'S NOT LIKE EVERYTHING HAPPENS ON DAY ONE. IT'S ODD IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE AND IDEALLY WILL BE AN ORDERLY PROCESS- ONE LAST THING IS JUST TO SAY THAT I THINK DH CS IS REFERRING TO. THE PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO RECRUIT AND ORGANIZATIONS THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO RECRUIT AS AMBASSADORS FOR COVERAGE AT THAT THIS MIGHT BE A WAY. TO SAY HEY LET'S TRY TO WORK WITH THE UNIONS SO TRY TO WORK. NOT JUST WITH OUR COUNTIES WITH OTHER- ORGANIZATIONS AND AGENCIES WITHIN THE COUNTY TO BE THOSE AMBASSADORS. AT SPECIFIC TO THIS POPULATION SORRY TO. SORT OF TAKE OVER BUT I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT BE HELPFUL THOUGHTS. I WAS HOPING TO GET THE ADMINISTRATION'S. TAKE ON THOSE COMMENTS IF WE CAN- NOTHING M. SPECIFIC CHAIR OTHER THAN AGREED TO IN TERMS OF WHAT TO ANDERSON TO THE NEW DOLLAR DONALD OUTLINED IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS STEPS IN. AGAIN WE'LL JUST NOTE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE WE ABSOLUTELY. WILL CONTINUE WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NOT ONLY DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES BUT WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS. TO IDENTIFY ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN BE DOING AT TO GET MEDICATE MEDICATE DESTRUCTION SO. I AGREE WITH WHAT ADAM SANDERLING MCDONALD OUTLINED IN TERMS OF THE PROCESS STEPS AND AS I INDICATED YES THAT CONFUSION AROUND AT DISSEMINATION OF THE- RENEWAL PACKETS IS WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE ALSO THAT LEE IS COMMUNICATED CLEARLY THAT THIS TIME YOU WHAT. ARE OPEN. TO PAY ATTENTION AND GET THE GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO FULLY COMPLETE THOSE. AT ENROLLMENT PACKED THAT THEIR REPUBLIC PACKAGES TO CONTINUE BENEFITS. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I FEEL LIKE WE WILL HAVE MANY MORE CONVERSATIONS ON THIS ISSUE GOING FORWARD- I WILL HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION ON THE- CAREER PATHWAYS PROGRAM PAGE SEVENTEEN OF THE AGENDA THEY HAD DONE A LISTENING SESSION. AND IN IT THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT LANGUAGE ACCESS AND WHETHER TRAINING WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. HAVING HEARD ABOUT THE WORK FORCE AND THE DIVERSITY AND STRENGTH THAT COMES FROM THAT. HOW ARE WE- IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT DSS IS WAITING FOR THE RESULTS OF AN R. F. P. BEFORE CAN TELL US ABOUT LANGUAGE ACCESS AND- THE MEDIUM FOR ITS TRAININGS BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE DEPARTMENTS TO PLEASE SHARE THE DETAILS. WITH BOTH US THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC- ON THE OTHER ASPECTS OF IMPLEMENTATION THAT EMERGE AND AS DECISIONS ARE MADE AND IN ADVANCE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS CAREER PATHWAY PROGRAMS. IS THIS SOMETHING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS AMENABLE TO. ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED TO DO THAT LET ME JUST SAY THAT I APPRECIATE THAT THE LIFTING UP. AT THIS IS A PRIORITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND THE OVER ARCHING CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY SO WE'RE GLAD TO FOLLOW UP.

RIGHT ADD GOOD AFTERNOON- CHEN ARAMBULA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I AM GONNA HAVE MY CAMERA ON FOR RIGHT NOW BUT IF THERE IS SOME KIND OF ISSUE- TECHNOLOGICALLY JUST LET ME KNOW AND I CAN ONLY SEND A- I FELT. I WILL- GO DIRECTLY INTO THE QUESTION REGARDING. THE OBJECTIVE SERVICES PROGRAMS THAT FACTORED IN- AND- SAID IF I ASK THE FIRST QUESTION IS THE PROVIDED OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET FOR THE APS PROGRAM. INCLUDING FEDERAL BECAUSE THEY NINETEEN REALLY FUNDING AND HOW THE COVETED FUNDING WITH YOU. I SO JUST BIRD OVERVIEW- THE APS BUDGET START WITH AS YOU ARE AWARE OF THE PROGRAM WAS RELYING TO THE COUNTIES IN TWENTY ELEVEN. SO THE BOOK OF THE FUNDING COMES FROM THE PROTECTIVE SERVICES SUB ACCOUNTS. I WILL TOUCH ON A FEW OF THE CURRENT ITEMS THOUGH- IT THAT GO BEYOND THAT THE REALIGNMENT FUNDING- WE HAVE- CREDIT RECEIVED AN INFLUX OF FUNDS FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES OVER THE LAST. YEAR YEAR AND A HALF IN THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM THAT ARE VERY NEW TO OUR PROGRAM- I WANT TO START WITH THE SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN STATE GENERAL FUND. AND THAT WILL HAS- A APR AND THE BUDGET ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES EXPANSION. DID APS EXTENSION THAT WAS AN EIGHTY ONE THIRTY FIVE LAST YEAR WHICH WOULD ENABLE THE PROGRAM TO PROVIDE LONGER TERM CASE MANAGEMENT FOR MORE COMPLEX CASES. EXPAND ATS MUMBAI DISCIPLINARY TEAM TO INCLUDE HOUSING REPRESENTATIVE ADDED COUNTY AGES THAT AGENCY. EMPLOYEES AS MANDATED REPORTER. LOWER THE OTHER AGE THE FACT DEATH OF- BUT OF EIGHTY SERVER. FROM AGE FIVE TO EIGHTY SIXTY. AND AT THE WITH THE WORK GROUP TO EXPLORE THE- OF ITS STATE WHY ITEM EIGHT. MANAGEMENT OR WHERE THAT THAT. AND ALL THE ON THE BIT MORE. ON BOTH THE AGE CHANGE FOR EIGHT YEAH AND THEIR TECHNICAL WORK AROUND EIGHT PM. MANAGE SPENDING DATA WAREHOUSE- THE LEADER IN MY COMPANY. YOUR CALL ALSO ABOUT AND REALLY FOR IT WANT TO SERVE THAT RECEIVE FROM THE FUND GOVERNMENT. OUR APRIL TWENTY TWO ONE THE DEPARTMENT REACHED A NINE FOUR MILLION AND ONE TIME FEDERAL. FOR AIDS YEAH FOR KOBE REALLY. I BROKE DOWN DIVERT YOUR OF THE FUNDING. A LOT OF DIRECTLY TO THE COUNTY IS THE PART THAT WAS LEFT BEHIND WITH BIRTH MOM OUT OF THE CHEMISTRY. AT THE STATE LEVEL- BUT FOR- THE COUNTY IF THEY WERE GIVEN BASICALLY A LIST OF PARAMETERS TO WORK AROUND- FOR THIS CODE AGREEABLY. A VARIETY OF DIRECT SERVICES TO VULNERABLE FINANCE WHO WERE VERY ISOLATED DURING DEPEND ON IT- AS WELL AS WITH THAT BACKING YOU NEED. TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER THINGS THAT CAME UP WHEN WE VERY QUICKLY HAVE THE SHIP FROM DOING- IN PERSON VISITS WITH THE VULNERABLE POPULATION YOU HAVING. TO DO THINGS A LITTLE MORE REMOTELY. AND SO AT A RESULT OF THAT I'M COUNTY THE HAVE- MAKE TO MAKE TO SATISFY AND SO FAR THEY DONE A VARIETY OF THINGS WITH THAT THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO OUR DEPARTMENT PROGRAM OCCURS- AND THEY HAVE HELPED APS CLIENT SECURE- LESS RESTRICTIVE EMERGENCY HOUSING OUTSIDE OF HOME SAFE OR OTHER HOUSING PROGRAM. THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUPPLEMENT APS CLIENT RESOURCES BEYOND TOP BRASS AS NEEDED- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SUPPLEMENT THE COST OF TRANSPORTING APS CLIENT NECESSARY APPOINTMENTS- CONTINUED EXPENSE OF ENSURING THE APS CLIENTS HEALTH NEEDS HAVE BEEN MET- BY BEING ABLE TO CONTRACT WITH PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES AND OTHERS WHO ARE ABLE TO VISIT APF CLIENTS IN THEIR OWN HOMES AS WELL. AS ADJUSTING TECHNOLOGY GAP. THE NINE POINT FOUR NINE DOLLARS THAT I'M TALKING EIGHT HERE RECEIVED FROM THAT THAT'S GOVERNMENT FOR RIDLEY. WE DEFINITELY EIGHT POINT SIX MILLION AND ONE TIME FEDERAL FROM AMERICAN RESCUE AT CALIFORNIA. OUR THAT EIGHT POINT SIX DOLLAR. FOR THE WILL BE JUST YOUR TO CAN IF YOU PROGRAMS- TO ALLOW THEM TO CONNECT. THE WORK THAT WE DONE DURING THE AND- ONLY INDICATE I'M NOT JUST GONNA IMPACTED BY KOBE THAT- ANALYSIS TO EVERY- WE ALSO WERE ABLE TO DO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY- HERE TO PUT TOGETHER AN OPERATIONAL PLAN FOR ATF IN CALIFORNIA. THAT WAS REQUIRED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ALL THE ADDRESSING. THAT FURTHER IN MY NEXT QUESTION. ARE WE ARE ALL RELIEVED FOR THAT WERE MAILING ANOTHER FORMER AS THE AMERICAN RED ACT. WHEN MONEY GO TO. EXPANDING OUR SMALL PILOT PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE WITH THE CALIFORNIA SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION CENTER OR WHAT. AND TO EXPAND THE EIGHTY TWO YEAR- PROGRAM FOR MASTER OF SOCIAL WORK STUDENT- WHERE OFFICIALLY THIS IS MODELED AFTER THE CHILD WELFARE PROGRAM. WHERE MASTER OF SOCIAL WORK YOU CAN HAVE PART OF THEIR EDUCATION PAID FOR IN EXCHANGE FOR WORKING IN EIGHTY ACT AFTER THEY GRADUATE. WHICH WE'RE HOPING WILL AND HOW ADDRESS. WORKFORCE SHORTAGES THAT WE'RE. CURRENTLY THINKING AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. AND FINALLY HAVE ALSO ENTERED IN A- WITH THE REAL ARE ARE CONFINED. WITHIN NATIONAL. I DON'T THINK THE SERVICE IS THE SENATE. PUT TOGETHER A PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN AROUND- ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES AND- ELDER ABUSE IN GENERAL THROUGHOUT THE STATE. FINALLY ATS IS A HAVEN THIRTY FEET ANOTHER ROUND AT NINE THROUGH THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT LATER THIS SPRING THAT WILL ALLOW US TO CONTINUE MANY OF THE PROJECT. I'M LIVING IN A SECOND QUESTION HOW ARE THE CHANGES AUTHORIZED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET INCLUDING A REDUCTION AT THE AGE. SIXTY FROM SIXTY FIVE BEING IMPLEMENTED AND ARE THERE ANY ISSUES OR CONFLICTS COMING TO LIGHT. CURRENTLY PROVIDING COUNTIES WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON DETAILS THE PASSWORD AND THE STATUTORY CHANGE. ALTHOUGH AB ONE THIRTY FIVE CHANGES THE ELIGIBILITY AGE FOR ELDER ACCESSING APIS FROM A FIFTY FIVE AN OLDER AGE SIXTEEN AND OLDER THE ELIGIBILITY AGE DID NOT CHANGE FOR THE PENAL CODE FOR ELDER ABUSE. AND IT DID NOT CHANGED MANDATED REPORTING LAW. YES I HAVE YOU WTA COUNTY THEIR CLUB ON SAKSHI AND FOR AT AND EXTERNAL. INCLUDING MANDATED REPORTERS LAW ENFORCEMENT ON THE EXCHANGE. ADDITIONALLY AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED ABOUT OTHER PROGRAMS IN THIS HEARING TODAY. COUNTY THEIR EXPERIENCING DIFFICULTY HIRING ADDITIONAL STAFF TO ADDRESS INCREASE CASELOADS. AND THEY'RE CONCERNED THEY WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE ALLOCATION PRIOR TO THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. LIVING ON YOUR THIRD QUESTION- WHAT ARE THE DEPARTMENT AND OUR LOCAL AGENCY DOING TO ENSURE THAT ADULTS MAYBE THAT SEVEN OF THE BE A STAR COLLECTOR PROTRACTED. ARMED WITH THE WIRES- THE PANDEMIC OBVIOUSLY BROUGHT ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES AROUND BEING ABLE TO PROTECT THE APS POPULATION. AND WE HAVE BEEN COMPLEXITY XIN DURING THE PANDEMIC YEAR WE STARRCADE BUT- CAN'T GET A LITTLE BIT AND NOW WE ARE SEEING- THAT WE ARE HAVING OUR CASES GO BACK UP AGAIN WHICH WE BELIEVE IS LARGELY BECAUSE- INDIVIDUALS ARE BACK IN THE COMMUNITY AND HAVING MORE INTERACTION. WITH MANDATED REPORTERS AND OTHER. I LET SO WE HAVE MADE THE AN EFFORT THOSE ARE THE COURSE THE LAST FEW YEARS TO REACH QUITE AND DIFFERENT. WE WORK WITH AND DEPARTMENT OF AGING CREATE A LIGHT IN HER NUMBER EACH YEAR REPORT. I'M CURRENTLY WEARING. ON AVERAGE ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY CALLS A WEAK STATEWIDE. TO THAT EIGHT HUNDRED NUMBER. AND THAT THE NUMBER THAT FOLKS CAN DIAL TO PUT IN THERE THAT COULD AND THEY'RE DIRECTLY CONNECTED TO THE COUNTY APS AGENCY- BUT WE WERE BEEN ABLE TO SHIFT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN VIRTUAL AND BRICK AND VISIT DIFFERENT COMPANY. THANKS AND AGAIN WE'VE HAD BEEN ABLE TO UTILIZE- THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT HAS COME AND TO BE ABLE TO REACH MORE INDIVIDUALS AND WERE VULNERABLE. INDIVIDUALS AND CREATIVE WAY- QUESTION THE GOVERNMENT REQUIRE CALIFORNIANS HE SAID MAY OPERATE PLAN FOR IT IF YES PROGRAM BY CHANCE. THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY HILL. WE PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE AND DESCRIBE HOW IT WILL ENSUE CONSISTENCY OF SERVICE AT THE CLOCK. THE OPERATIONAL PLAN WITH THE MESSAGE OF THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION FOR COMMUNITY LIVING AND APPROVED ON MARCH FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TALE. THE PLAN WAS DEVELOPED BY C. B. S. S. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COUNTY ATF AGENT THE NCWTS. MEDIA ACCESSIBILITY TO THREE LISTENING SESSIONS IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH CALIFORNIA APFA ENVIRONMENTAL STANCE AND INFORM THE CREATION AND DIRECTION OF THE OPERATIONAL PLAN. THE FIRST SESSION I THE FIRST OPENING SPECIAL ONLY OPEN TO COUNTY APS LEADERSHIP AND STAFF WHILE THE REMAINING SECTIONS WERE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC AND PUBLICIZED IN ADVANCE YOU HUNDREDS OF AGING AND DISABILITY OVER STATE WIDE. BASED ON THE FEEDBACK WE RECEIVED FROM THE LOOKING. AND THE FOLLOWING HIGH LEVEL NEEDS AND GOALS FOR IDENTIFIED. AND WE CAME UP WITH PERFECT DIFFERENT HIGH LEVEL MEETINGS. THE FIRST ONE IS ENHANCING SYSTEM CORONATION AND COMMUNICATION. BOTH DURING. THE AFFAIR BUT SAYS WITHIN AND ACROSS COUNTY. DURING AN ONGOING CASE MANAGEMENT BOOK DURING THE A TF WORKFORCE AND CAPACITY. PUBLIC AWARENESS AND PREVENTION OF ELDER ABUSE IN APS TANGIBLE EMERGENCY NEEDS HOUSING COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES FROM EIGHT COUNTY BUT ONE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE WTA WAS ASSEMBLED TO REFINE THE OPERATIONAL PLAN INCLUDING A VISION AND MISSION AND VALUES AND IDENTIFY CONCRETE IMPROVEMENT PROJECT AMONG THE HIGH LEVEL GOAL AREAS THAT I OUTLINED ABOUT. THE WORKER TO NINE TIMES IN JANUARY FEBRUARY AND IDENTIFIED STATE AND COUNTY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS THAT ALIGN WITH THE SIX HIGH LEVEL NEED THAT ARE LISTED ABOUT. YES THE EXPECTED DURING A LITTLE OVER EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING THREE WOULD BE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACTIVE BRING TWENTY TWENTY TWO- TO EMPLOYMENT THE- PROJECTS THAT WERE OUTLINED IN OUR OPERATIONAL PLANS- BOTH THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION FOR COMMUNITY LIVING AND PDF THAT WILL RELIEVE THE OPERATIONAL PLAN FOR THE PUBLIC LATER THE- RANGE. AND I ALSO PROVIDED THE COMMITTEE- BUT WITH A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE OPERATIONAL PLAN AN EFFORT LIKE THAT. NEXT QUESTION WHAT IS THE STATUS. OF THE CONSULTATION AND TIME FRAME ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STATEWIDE AUTOMATED APS LIGHT MANAGEMENT BUT THAT. I HAVE CREATED A VOLUNTEER WORK GROUP AT TEN ATS COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES FROM BOTH LARGE AND SMALL COUNTY IS. LOOK AT THE CURRENT APS DATA COLLECTION LANDSCAPE. THE WORKGROUP BURKE MET IN LATE JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY HILL AND DECIDED THAT PDFS SURVEY ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ON CURRENT APS DATA COLLECTION PRACTICES AND PREFERENCES. BUT I THINK MY DATA COLLECTION AND OR CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. MEDIA CENTER SURVEY. FROM FIFTH FIVE TO FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY. THE WORK GROUP RECONVENED ON FIFTH TO AN THE FAIRBURY. THE SURVEY SHOWED THAT MANY COUNTY ONE AS STREAMLINED THE WAY TO SHARE ETF DATA BETWEEN COUNTY ALTHOUGH COUNTY FARM NEXT ON THE NEED FOR A STATEWIDE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM EIGHT COUNTY YOU'D EXPECT THEM CREATED BY THE SAME VENDOR. HOWEVER MOST OF THE LARGEST COUNTY TO THE STATE DO NOT USE THAT THAT THE MORE THAT VENDOR. THEY CALL THEIR WORK WILL CONTINUE AROUND THE ISSUE IN THE COMING MONTHS. AND WE WILL BE HAVING A PUBLIC MEETING IN THE COMING NINE AND OUR REPORT ON THE FEASIBILITY OF A STATEWIDE SYSTEM IN. THE LEGISLATURE AND NOVEMBER TWENTY TWENTY YEAH. AND OUR FINAL IF YES QUESTION HOW DID YOU ACCESS THE SURE THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR ATS ALIGNED WITH THE MPA. AT EIGHT ACCESS AT THE STATE AND COUNTY LEVEL HAS BEEN VERY INVOLVED IN THE CREATION OF THE NEW OLDER DISABILITY JUSTICE COORDINATING COUNCIL WHICH CAME DIRECTLY OUT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE NPA. ACCOUNTS HOLDING PROCEEDS TO COUNTY APS REPRESENTATIVE AS WELL AS EASY ACCESS REPRESENTATION- AND THE COUNCIL WILL PROVIDE A FORUM FOR BETTER COORDINATION ACROSS THE STATE FOR. THE EIGHTH. LANDSCAPE AND ADDITIONALLY APR CONTINUE TO PROVIDE DATA TO THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING FOR THEIR EMPTY A DASHBOARD AND WE CONTINUE TO HAVE AN ON GOING- DIALOGUE WITH OUR COLLEAGUES AT DEPARTMENT OF AGING AROUND ANY ELDER DISABILITY JUSTICE ISSUES THAT COME UP AT THE PARK MASTER PLAN. H. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND- THAT COMPLETE MY TESTIMONY THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE WILL ATTEMPT TO GO BACK TO A CLEAR RAMSEY CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR WITH CDSS. HELLO BUT CHAIR CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW. MUCH BETTER THANK YOU. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE EARLY TECHNICAL ISSUES. I WAS GOING TO RETURN WITH MY ANSWER TO QUESTION TWO- SO AS I MENTIONED FEDERALLY ADMINISTERED PROGRAM HOWEVER THE STATE ENTITIES THAT ARE COMMITTED TO ENSURING ALL ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS RECEIVE THE BENEFITS THEY'RE ENTITLED TO- TO DEFEND THE EFFECT DOES NOT HAVE A PROGRAM CALLED THE HOUSING AND DISABILITY ADVOCACY PROGRAM OF THAT WE TRY TO MAKE SURE WE DO SPECIFIC APPLICATION ASSISTANCE AND OUTREACH. TO POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS FROM AROUND AT THE FIGHT AND OTHER DISABILITY BENEFITS- AND WE ARE OPEN TO YOU KNOW WORKING WITH THAT- LEGISLATURE TO THINK OF OTHER POSSIBLE WAYS TO. ENSURE THAT WE'RE MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR AT THE BY RECIPIENT. OF FOR THE APPLICANTS WERE NOT FAMILIAR WITH TECHNOLOGY ON SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION DOES ALLOW FOR IN PERSON APPOINTMENT ON A LIMITED BASIS. SO BOTH OF PDFS AND AFTER THEY HAVE PROVIDED INFORMATION ABOUT USING ALTERNATIVE METHODS TO APPLY AND- WE ARE AT THE MENTION OF MENTION ALSO IN A LATER- ANSWER- WE ARE HOPING THAT THE US SOCIAL SECURITY FIELD OFFICES WILL BE RE OPENING SOON AND THAT WILL ADDITIONALLY MAKE. COMMUNICATION FOR RECIPIENTS. AND APPLICANTS MUCH SIMPLER. I'M ON NOW MOVES TO OUR NEXT QUESTION. WHICH INSTRUCTED MINISTRATION TRACKED THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE AFTER FIVE P. GRANT. AND WHAT APPROXIMATE LEVEL WITH THE GRANT BE OUT FOR INDIVIDUALS AND COUPLES IF THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED EVERY YEAR WHERE FEDERAL HOLD WAS PROVIDED. AND CAN BE TRACKED WITH MOVING FORWARD TO INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY AROUND THE IMPACT NOT PROVIDING STATE COLA. THANK YOU FOR THIS QUESTION WE DO NOT CURRENTLY TRACK THE PURCHASING POWER OF SFI. GRANTS HOWEVER CDS THAT IS GOING TO WORK WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THE BEST WAY TO CAPTURE THIS DATA AND DISPLAYED AND PROVIDE IT TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO HOPING TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU- POSITIONAL INFORMATION- OUR NEXT QUESTION WAS HOW DID MINISTRATION ENGAGE WITH. IFP RECIPIENT AND THEIR ADVOCATES. AND ONE OF THE RECIPIENTS STORY TELLING US ABOUT THE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION SHE- DID. PARTICIPATE IN STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND HAS THROUGHOUT THE PAST YEAR WITH ADVOCACY GROUPS SUCH AS CALIFORNIA FOR AFTER FIVE. AND OTHER AND BESIDES THE P. RECIPIENTS- TO HEAR THEIR FEEDBACK AND WE REALLY HAVE HEARD- FROM THOSE ARE CONSTITUENTS AND FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. HOWEVER THE RECIPIENTS STRUGGLE TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS WHEN AT THE SIDE. OF THE P. R. THEIR ONLY BENEFITS. AND WE ALSO THAT THESE RECIPIENTS STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN THEIR HOUSING- SO WE ARE HOPING TO- THAT ARE GRANT INCREASE THAT WE PROPOSED BUDGET IN. FOUR TWENTY JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WILL HELP. RELIEVE SOME OF THE PRESSURE. ON EFFORT BY RECIPIENTS AND WE'RE ALSO IMPLEMENTING TO A HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS BRANCH THE COMMUNITY CARE EXPANSION PROGRAM WHICH WILL BOTH PRESERVE AND EXPAND THE NUMBER OF BEDS AVAILABLE FOR AT THE BIASES P. AND CAPPY RECIPIENTS STATEWIDE. TROPE ALSO HOPING THAT THAT WILL DO- REAL GAINES FOR PEOPLE TERMS OF PRESERVING HELPING AND MAKING SURE PEOPLE HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO SLEEP. AND THEN A FINAL QUESTION IS HOW DOES THE EFFECT SURE THAT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR EVERYBODY AT THE P. ALIGNED WITH THE MASTER PLAN. SHE PREVIOUSLY MOST OF THE FIGHT AT THE P. POLICIES AND PROCEDURES HOWEVER WE ARE COMMITTED. TO WORKING THROUGH THE MASTER PLAN PROCESS AND THINKING ABOUT ALL THE WAYS THAT WE CAN SUPPORT AS A FIGHT THE- WORK FOR THE MASTER PLAN. PART OF THAT WORK BE CONTINUED BOTH IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AND IN OUR PROPOSAL FOR NEXT YEAR'S BUDGET TO INCREASE GRANT AMOUNT. OF WHICH IS AN MPA PRIORITY. WE ARE ALSO CONTINUING TO ENGAGE AS A MEMBER OF THE DISABILITY AND AGING COMMUNITY LIVING ADVISORY COMMITTEE TO WORK ON ISSUES THAT AFFECT AT THE FIRE THE P. RECIPIENTS. INCLUDING THE NEED FOR INCREASED HELPING. WITH THAT I WILL STOP THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM A NON CON BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AN ONGOING DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD AT THIS TIME BUT HAPPY TO HAVE INTERNET QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM JACKIE BUT ARE STILL WITH THE L. L. YES IN OUR INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE EXERCISES PEAPOD JET- ONE THING THAT WE NOTED IS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES CONTINUE TO ASSUME THAT CASELOAD WILL CONTINUE TO DECLINE. FROM WE ARE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND OF POSSIBLE REASONS WHY THIS MAY BE- AND- HAVE REQUESTED TO GET JUST ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON APPLICATION RATES AN EXIT TRENDS. I'M TO SEE IF WE CAN FIND ANYTHING THERE- BUT WITH REGARDS TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT IS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS THE DEPARTMENT. NOTED IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO SIGNALED ITS INTENT TO PROVIDE TWO HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TO INCREASE S. S. P. GRANT LEVELS BY AN ESTIMATED TWENTY THREE POINT NINE FIVE PERCENT- EFFECTIVE JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- BASED OF OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE PROVISION OF THE TWO NINETY SIX MILLION IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR IS MEANT TO COMPLY WITH INTENT LANGUAGE- THAT THE STATE INCREASE S. S. P. GRANTS BASED OFF OF THE SAME CALCULATION. USED TO DETERMINE THE RECENT GRAND INCREASE THAT TOOK EFFECT THIS JANUARY. OUR CURRENTLY- JUST TWO THINGS THAT WE WERE FLAG IS THAT ONE THE ADMINISTRATION'S S. S. P. GRANT INCREASE REFLECTS ONE OF MANY- SP GRANT GOALS THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD CHOOSE TO PURSUE FOR EXAMPLE WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN TO ASSIST P. GRANT INCREASE- IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR WOULD RESULT IN GRANTS- FALLING ABOVE JANUARY TWO THOUSAND NINE GRANT LEVELS PRIOR TO WHEN- WE BEGAN TO DO THE GRANT REDUCTIONS DUE TO I'M BUDGET CONSTRAINTS- UNDER THE GREAT RECESSION BUT ALSO AMONG WE- AT AT STOPPED PROVIDING ANNUAL COLAS- OTHER- IT WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH TO FULLY RESTORE PURCHASING POWER LOST OVER THOSE YEARS- BUT ALSO IT WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH TO ENSURE THAT. ALL S. S. P. GRANT LEVELS AT LEAST EQUAL A LEVEL ADDITIONALLY WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION- IS NOT PLANNING TO PROVIDE ANY FUNDING I'M TO ALIGN WITH OTHER INTENT LANGUAGE- THAT IS TO RESTORE ANNUAL COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS I'M BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE- SO WITH THAT SAID WE SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE SET ITS OWN GOALS IN TERMS OF WHERE IT WOULD LIKE- ASSESSES PICK GRANT LEVELS TO ALTERNATELY BE THINGS THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER IN FORMULATING THOSE GRANT GOALS INCLUDE WHETHER WOULD LIKE TO PHASE IN THE GOAL FOR MULTIPLE YEARS- WHETHER IT WOULD LIKE TO TARGET RESOURCES. TO PROVIDE GRANT INCREASES TO SPECIFIC GRANT CATEGORIES OR RECIPIENT GROUPS AND THEN ALSO CONSIDER HOW TO MAINTAIN PURCHASING POWER OF. GRAND STUDIO FUTURE INFLATION. SECOND THING THAT WE IN OUR ANALYSIS IS- WHATEVER THE GOAL THE LEGISLATURE ULTIMATELY LANDS ON WE DO SUGGESTS- REVISITING THE EXISTING INTENT LANGUAGE. AND ALIGNING- THE LANGUAGE WITH THE M. GOAL EXPLICITLY ON THIS RECOMMENDATION IS EVEN TRUE TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE CHOOSES TO PURSUE. A WE BELIEVE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLANNED S. S. P. GRANT INCREASE IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- THIS IS BECAUSE- BASED OFF OF JUST OUR READING OF THE LANGUAGE IS. THE LANGUAGE DOES NOT SPECIFY THE EXACT FUNDING AMOUNT OR GRANT INCREASE ALL IT SAYS IS THAT THE GRANT INCREASE SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME CALCULATION. SO WE JUST THINK GIVEN THAT AND CLEAR UP UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE EXACT GRAN INCREASE IF THE LEGISLATURE DID WANT TO. SECURE THE AMOUNT THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS TO PROVIDE IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR- IT COULD REVISE THE INTENT LANGUAGE TO JUST SPECIFY THAT THE TWO HUNDRED NINETY SIX MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE PROVIDED IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. THANK YOU KATHY SANDERLING MCDONALD WITH CWD F. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR KATHY SUTHERLAND REBUTTAL TO THE PDA I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT ABOUT APS AND I WAS ASKED TO TALK FIRST ABOUT THE TRAINING PROGRAM SECOND ABOUT THE AB ONE THIRTY FIVE CHANGES THAT MISS RUTLEDGE A NEW MARIE DID WHICH AS YOU KNOW WAS ORIGINALLY IN EIGHTY SIX NINETY FIVE LAST YEAR- CHAMPION BY YOU SIR AND SO- I CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW THAT'S GOING SO FAR AND THEN THE ALSO TALK ABOUT ABOUT THE AFFECTED DISASTERS ON OUR SENIOR AND A POPULATION OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. THAT WE SERVE TO A PS VITA SASS SO FIRST ON THE TRAINING- I WAS ASKED TO TALK ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF THE TRAINING PROGRAM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THROUGH FOR THE FIRST TIME FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED- IN THE AMOUNT OF THREE MILLION GENERAL FUND WE MATCH THAT TO FEDERAL FUNDS IT BECAME SIX MILLION TOTAL TOTAL FUNDS AND IT WAS AVAILABLE OVER THREE YEARS THAT WAS THEN RE UPPED IN TWENTY NINETEEN FOR FIVE POINT SEVEN MILLION BY GENERAL FUND ELEVEN MILLION TOTAL AND THAT FUNDING EXPIRES JUNE THIRTIETH OF THIS YEAR. SO THE STRUCTURE OF HOW THE TRAINING WAS PUT TOGETHER HAS BEEN VERY THOUGHTFUL WERE UTILIZING THREE ACADEMIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND VARIOUS TRAINING TOPICS ARE AVAILABLE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE DELIVERED MORE THAN ELEVEN THOUSAND EVEN LEARNING COURSES AND THERE WERE ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY- MORE LIVE INSTRUCTOR LED VIRTUAL COURSES AND MORE ON A SIMILAR PATH IN TERMS OF NUMBERS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR. THE VIRTUAL COURSES WITH THE INSTRUCTORS REACHED TWENTY TWO HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS AND WE DO HAVE AN ESTIMATED ELEVEN HUNDRED WORKERS STATEWIDE SO AS YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THEM TOOK MORE THAN ONE OF THE CLASSES I ALSO WANT TO MENTION HERE THAT WE'VE MADE THE TRAINING AVAILABLE TO THE- P. A. P. G. P. C. PARTNERS THAT WE HAVE AT THE COUNTY LEVEL SOME OF OUR MEMBERS AT. C. W. D. . ALSO EITHER- SERVE AS OR WITHIN THEIR AGENCY. THOSE FUNCTIONS BUT IN ALL COUNTIES APS WORKS REALLY CLOSELY WITH THEIR- PUBLIC ADMINISTRATORS PUBLIC GUARDIANS OF PUBLIC CONSERVATORS BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH OVERLAP IN THE POPULATIONS THAT WE SERVE. AND THE NEEDS OF THOSE POPULATIONS SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO THEIR STAFF AS WELL. THEY'RE ACTUALLY REQUIRED I THINK TO GET FORTY HOURS OF TRAINING- AND SO THAT PER HELPS TO PROVIDE THAT FOR THEM. SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF THE AVAILABLE TRAINING OF THAT'S A MORE KIND OF HIGH LEVEL TRAINING INCLUDE- HOMELESSNESS AND APS. DEMENTIA INTERVENTIONS COGNITIVE ASSESSMENTS AND SAFETY PLANNING AND ACHIEVING CONSISTENCY IN KEY FINDINGS FOR OUR APS STAFF. SO WE- CURRENTLY HAVE AN ASK TO CONTINUE THE FUNDING SURE THAT'S NOT SURPRISING SINCE IT IS- EXPIRING. IN THE REQUEST IS FOR FOUR POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND OF COURSE WE WOULD THEN ALSO BE ABLE TO MATCH THAT WITH FEDERAL FUNDS. AND TO DO THAT IN THE EARLY GOING FORWARD- IF WE WERE TO LOSE THE TRAINING WHERE ASKED WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT I MEAN IT I IT SERIOUSLY COULD NOT BE A WORST TIME TO LOSE FUNDING. IT WOULD DISMANTLE ALL OF THIS WORK THAT HAS GONE INTO DEVELOPING THIS VERY PROFESSIONAL LIVES TRAINING AT A TIME WHEN THROUGH THE CHANGES IN AB ONE THIRTY FIVE. AS WELL AS THE OTHER FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE DISCUSSIONS THAT MISS RUTLEDGE WAS TALKING ABOUT ARE WE GOING TO DEVELOP IN CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM HOW DO WE STANDARDIZE AND PROFESSIONAL WISE THIS PROGRAM. THAT'S BEEN IN EXISTENCE NOW FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND IT'S FINALLY JUST GROWING UP TO START TO MEET THE DEMAND THAT WE KNOW IS THERE AND WILL BE GROWING OVER TIME- WE ARE HIRING STAFF FOR INCREASING OUR SERVICES AND THIS WOULD JUST. KIND OF RIPPED THAT AWAY AND MAKE US UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE TRAINING NEEDED WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT AS WE ARE IMPLEMENTING THESE NEW CHANGES IN THE PROGRAM WILL ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT A CORE TRAINING MODEL. THROUGH THIS FUNDING SORT OF LIKE WE DO IN CHILD WELFARE WHERE EVERY COUNTY- HAS THEIR WORKER BUT CHILD WELFARE GO THROUGH THE SAME TRAINING AND WE'RE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT IN A PATH AS WELL WHICH IS NOT BEEN SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT. SO AS FAR AS HOW THE AB ONE THIRTY FIVE- EXPANSIONS ARE GOING- AS YOU KNOW THEY HAPPEN ON JANUARY FIRST. THE QUITE A FEW THINGS THE TWO THAT WE FOCUS THE MOST ON OUR- OF THAT SWITCH AN AGE FROM SIXTY FIVE TO SIXTY WHICH PUTS THAT IN LINE WITH THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT PROGRAMS. AND THEN ALSO THE ENHANCED CASE MANAGEMENT SO THOSE WITH MORE COMPLEX NEEDS ARE ABLE TO. STAY IN THE PROGRAM WITH AN OPEN CASE LONGER AND COUNTIES CAN PROVIDE MORE MORE CASE SERVICES. IT'S STILL VERY NEW AND SO WE'RE JUST GATHERING DATA SO I'M NOT I CAN'T BE QUITE AS DEFINITIVE NOW. BUT I KNOW THAT WE ARE ALREADY SEEING RESULTS WE HAVE ANECDOTAL INFORMATION. I DID WANT TO SHARE- FROM VENTURA COUNTY. THEY RECEIVED A REFERRAL FOR A SIXTY YEAR OLD WHOSE SON WAS VERBALLY ABUSING HER FINANCIALLY ABUSING HER. ODD TAKING MONEY WITHOUT HER CONSENT LOCKING HER OUT OF HER OWN APARTMENT THAT SHE SHARED WITH HIM. AND BEFORE THAT COUNTY WOULD HAVE NEEDED TO REFER THAT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT APS CANNOT OF STEPPED IN BECAUSE OF HER AGE. IN THIS CASE THEY COULD STEP IN THEY INTERVENE THE SON HAS MOVED OUT. NOW THE- THE WOMAN IS HAVING DIFFICULTY AFFORDING THE APARTMENT BECAUSE HE WAS THERE HELPING TO PAY THE RENT. SO YOU DO SEE HOW THINGS CAN KIND OF SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL FOR SOMEONE- THAT COUNTY IS HELPING BOTH WITH TRAUMA INFORMED SERVICES FOR HER. BECAUSE SHE'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN THROUGH A LOT BUT ALSO WORKING TO BRING HOME SAFE THE ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS THAT WE OPERATE FOR A PS TO BEAR. TO HELP HER RELOCATE TO MORE AFFORDABLE AND SAFE HOUSING. SO WE CAN JUST SEE FROM THAT ONE EXAMPLE IT CAN REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE SOME FOR ONE INDIVIDUAL PERSON AND OVER TIME IT'LL BE MORE AND MORE OF THOSE CASES. I WILL MENTION TO YOU THAT THE SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS PROVIDED. ALL WE WILL PROBABLY REACH OUT TO YOUR STAFF AS WELL AS TO DSS. TO TALK ABOUT WHETHER WE COULD ROLL OVER SOME OF THOSE FUNDING FOR THIS YEAR TO NEXT YEAR. BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW IT JUST GETTING STARTED KIND OF MID YEAR AND WE'RE WORKING ON HIRING. OF IT'S EXPECTED THAT WILL WANT TO TRY TO ROLL SOME OF THAT OVER SO WE'LL BE IN TOUCH ON THAT- TO OTHER THINGS THE FIRST IS THAT A RELATED ISSUE WAS A LACK OF MSW THIS I KNOW. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WORK FORCE ISSUES YOU'RE HEARING THAT I THINK IN EVERY PANEL AND EVERY HEARING- YOU HEARD IT ON THE OTHER PANEL FOR ME WE ARE EXPERIENCING THAT. AND ONE OF THE SPECIFIC THINGS BLESS YOU- IS THAT OUR MASTERS IN SOCIAL WORK STUDENTS AND GRADUATES ARE VERY IN DEMAND. ESPECIALLY IN APS OF CHILD WELFARE THAT MASTERS LEVEL OF SOCIAL WORK IS REALLY ABLE TO SUPERVISE OTHERS PROVIDE THAT HIGHER DEGREE OF SERVICE AND THEIR- JUST ARE NOT ENOUGH OF THEM. THE SOCIAL WORK SCHOOLS ARE VERY IMPACTED LONG BEACH STATE FOR EXAMPLE- RECEIVES AROUND TWELVE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS A YEAR THEY HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY SLOTS AND THEIR PROGRAM. AND SO WE ARE- ALONG WITH THE DEANS AND DIRECTORS OF THE SCHOOLS OF SOCIAL WORK AT S. W. AND S. C. ARE YOU. ASKING FOR A HUNDRED EIGHTEEN MILLION OVER TWO YEARS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF NSW'S IN THE PIPELINE- FOR PUBLIC SECTOR AND- ORGANIZATIONS THAT WE PARTNER WITH AND THE INTENT THERE IS TO BOTH INCREASE SLOTS IN THE SCHOOLS OF SOCIAL WORK. FOR NSW'S AND ALSO HOPE TO PROVIDE STIPENDS AND DIRECTLY SUPPORT THE FIELD PLACEMENTS THAT ARE REQUIRED DURING THE TWO YEARS OF THE PROGRAM THOSE ARE OFTEN WITH THE COUNTY OR WITH A NON PROFIT IN THE COMMUNITY. AND BEING MARRIED TO A SOCIAL WORKER I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE THEY ARE AND THEY'RE NEEDED THEY REALLY HELP IN THOSE ORGANIZATIONS BUT ORGANIZATIONS DON'T HAVE A LOT OF ABILITY TO SUPERVISE THEM. THEY'RE OFTEN THEMSELVES ON A LIMITED BUDGET SO THIS WILL HELP WITH THAT. I'M AND THEN FINALLY I. ABOUT A DOES THAT. I AS YOU HEARD FROM THE PRIOR PANEL FROM- YOU W. AND ASKS ME- AND YOU KNOW THERE'S JUST SUCH AN INCREASING NUMBER OF ALL KINDS OF EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS- OUR POPULATIONS THAT WE SERVE IN APS. AND I JUST SASSER AMONG SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE THEY MAY HAVE DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT THAT RELIES ON ELECTRICITY SO THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUTDOWNS AFFECT THEM- HE- EMERGENCIES- EXTREME COLD WILDFIRES WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. GET IN THERE AND HELP GET THEM OUT OF THEIR HOME SAFE. AND SO- WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT COUNTY STAFF. ARE HIRED TO DO OTHER THINGS THEY'RE NOT HIRED TO BE EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT THEY OFTEN GET PULLED AWAY FROM THEIR REGULAR JOBS AND SO THAT. PEOPLE CAN'T GET SERVICES THAT THEY NEED FROM THERE ARE FROM THE PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE WRITING. AND THAT CAN LAST A REALLY LONG TIME. IN PARADISE FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S STILL GOING THROUGH RECOVERY FROM THAT FIRE YEAR YEARS LATER AND THAT WILL BE CONTINUE TO DO SO AT A BUTTE COUNTY THEY CONTINUE TO RE DIRECT STAFF FOR THAT. AND SO- WE'RE SPONSORING A REQUEST TO HELP WITH THAT- ALONG WITH CHILDREN NOW- IT WOULD BE ASSISTING- AND ADULTS PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE USING IHS. FOR HELP RELOCATING SOMEONE- ALLOW OUR I JUST THAT'S PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE HOURS RELATED TO THAT. PROVIDE FUNDING FOR DEDICATED COUNTY STAFF A REVOLVING FUND TO HELP COUNTIES WITH. EXPENDITURES THAT THEY MAKE BUT THEY EITHER HAVE TO WAIT A REALLY LONG TIME TO GET- FINANCE FOR FROM FEMA OR FEMALE WILL NEVER REPAY. AND SO THINKING ABOUT PAYING BACK WHAT YOU GET REIMBURSED FOR AND THEN BEING ABLE TO USE THAT OVER TIME AS WELL TO. REIMBURSE THE COUNTY FOR EXPENDITURES- WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN THAT AND THEN FUNDING TO PROVIDE TRAINING FOR STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS. THERE'S A FEW OTHER COMPONENTS AS WELL. AND SO- JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVE TO COVER. OF THERE'S A OF. ON WORK FORCE AS WELL AS EMERGENCY RESPONSE- AND SO HAPPY TO BE PART OF THOSE AND THINK ABOUT WAYS THAT ARE PROGRAMS CAN BOTH HELP AND BE HELPED BY THE- THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL HEAR FROM MIKE HERALD WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- STAFF- MIKE CARROLL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY ON ON THE ISSUES RELATED TO S. ASIDE. FROM SOME OF THIS GROUND IT'S BEEN COVERED A BIT BUT I HOPE THAT I CAN PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE INSIGHT INTO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE CONFRONTING US ASIDE RECIPIENTS- I THINK- YOU KNOW. WE ALL KNOW ABOUT THE DECLINES THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE SS I GRANT AMOUNTS THAT OCCURRED SINCE 200-010-2000 ELEVEN BUT WHEN YOU LOOK BACK ACTUALLY THOSE DECLINES REALLY STARTED MUCH EARLIER THAN THAT THEY REALLY STARTED BACK. IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE- WIND THE LEGISLATURE- BEGAN TO SUSPEND THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS AND OVER THAT BEGINNING WITH THOSE TIMES MANY YEARS EVEN PRIOR TO TWO THOUSAND TEN NO COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS FOR BEING PROVIDED NO GRANT INCREASES WERE BEING PROVIDED FOR THE PROGRAM. AND SO THE ATTRITION THE AT THE THAT WAS OCCURRING WITH THE PROGRAM SIMPLY GOT ACCELERATED IN TWO THOUSAND TEN IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE DID THE REALLY DRASTIC ACTIONS OF REDUCING THE GRANT BY SEVENTY THREE DOLLARS A MONTH DOWN TO THE FEDERAL MINIMUM. AND THEN PERMANENTLY SUSPENDING THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT RATHER THAN DOING IT ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS IS AS HAD BEEN THE UNFORTUNATE PRACTICE PRIOR TO THAT- AND SO DO YOU KNOW DUE TO THAT WE KNOW THAT THE AT THE VALUE OF THE SS I GRANT HAS REALLY DECLINED OVER TIME- AND- DURING THAT TIME WE'VE ALSO SEEN. HOUSING PRICES IN CALIFORNIA RIGHTS REMARKABLY- AND IN FACT RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOT A SINGLE COUNTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE A STUDIO APARTMENT RENTS. ON AVERAGE FOR IN THE FOR FAIR MARKET RENT WHICH IS 40% OF THE MARKET LEVEL BY THE WAY. RENTS BEFORE LAST DAM THE- SSI GRANT AMOUNT. NOT A SINGLE COUNTY M. IN FACT THE- THE AVERAGE PRICE IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW FOR SINGLE FOR A STUDIO APARTMENT. EXCEEDS FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS NOT PROBABLY IS A BIT OF AN UNDERESTIMATE SINCE. THE DATA TENDS TO- IS A LITTLE BIT BEHIND THE REALITY THAT OF THE MARKET PLACE OUT ON THE STREETS. SO THAT THIS PROBLEM CONTINUES TO REALLY COMPOUND ON A ON A- REGULAR BASIS AND- WE SEE THE RESULT OF THIS- IN HOUSING INSTABILITY OF OUR CLIENTS. INCREASE HUNGER INCREASED NEEDS FOR OTHER KIND OF BENEFITS AND SERVICES- PEOPLE HAVING TO GO TO FOOD BANKS- ENDS AND JUST NOT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD THE BASIC NECESSITIES OF LIFE- SO THIS CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE NEED TO. KEEP OUR EYE ON AND- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WE THINK THE GRANT AMOUNTS ARE INADEQUATE- WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR TO INCREASE FINALLY INCREASE. PARTIALLY RESTORE THE GRANT INCREASE THAT WAS TAKEN IN TWO THOUSAND TEN ELEVEN. WE GOT HALF ABOUT ROUGHLY HALF OF THAT BACK- AND THAT'S A GREAT START BUT I WOULD POINT OUT IN YOUR ANALYSIS WHICH I THINK DOES THIS VERY WELL. THAT HAVE THE EFFECT OF. INCREASING THE- THE VALUE OF THE GRANT TO ABOUT 92% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL NOW. BEFORE ALL THE GRANT INCREASE THE COURTS WERE ABOVE A HUNDRED PERCENT- BUT- WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK IN THE ANALYSIS FROM THE COMMITTEE. IS NEXT YEAR. WHICH SHOWS THE DROP WE'RE DEFERRING THAT SECOND PAYMENT. UNTIL TWO TO TWO THOUSAND TWENTY FOUR SO WE'RE MAKING WE'VE MADE GOOD PROGRESS THIS YEAR NOT ENOUGH PROGRESS WE MADE SOME GOOD PROGRESS. IN TWO TWENTY TWENTY TO INCREASING THE GRANT UP. BUT NEXT YEAR WE'RE GONNA FALL BACK AGAIN. AND WE'RE GOING TO BE ROUGHLY BACK TO WHERE WE WERE PRIOR TO THE IN THE INCREASE IN THE GRANT BECAUSE AS WE KNOW. INFLATION IS VERY HIGH RIGHT NOW. SO THAT THAT THAT IS WHY I THINK YOU CAN- WESTERN CENTER AND CALIFORNIA'S REST ASIDE OR ASKING TO ACCELERATE THE TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY FOUR. INCREASED INTO THE TWO THOUSAND TWENTY THREE TWENTY A TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET. SO THAT WE DON'T FALL BACK SO THAT THE GRANT THE F. P. O. AMOUNT DOES NOT DECLINE BACK CLOSE TO THE LEVEL WHERE WE ARE AT. IF WE WERE TO INCREASE- IF WE WERE TO PROVIDE THE SECOND PAYMENT IN IN THE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE BUDGET. WE'D ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO PUMP UP THE PERCENT OF THE APPEAL TO ABOUT NINETY THREE POINT TWO PERCENT. SO I REALLY THINK THAT'S THE CHOICE THAT'S IN FRONT OF THE LEGISLATURE DO WE CONTINUE TO TAKE A STEP FORWARD OR ARE READ THIS YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE FRANKLY A STEP BACK. AND THEN IS YOUR ANALYSIS POINTS OUT IN TWO YEARS. WE'LL PUT THAT THIRTY SEVEN DOLLARS BACK AND WILL BE BACK EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE TODAY. AND SO I THINK THE LEGISLATURE REALLY NEEDS TO I THINK BE MORE PROACTIVE IN THIS. AND TO REALLY INCREASE GRANTS- ON A REGULAR CONSECUTIVE BASIS SO WE CAN GET THE GRANT LEVELS BACK UP ABOVE A LEVEL AT MINIMUM- SO. YEAH I THINK- THIS IS SOMETHING I REALLY DO THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO TAKE SERIOUSLY. AND CONSIDER- SO THAT WOULD CERTAINLY BE SOMETHING THAT WE'D BE LOOKING TO GET- DONE- THIS YEAR AND ON THIS ISSUE THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT THAT WAS RAISED BY VOEPEL AGO- WE ABSOLUTELY THINK THAT THE- THE- COAL AS IT'S CALLED. OUGHT TO BE MADE PERMANENT THAT WE OUGHT TO GO BACK TO THE DAYS WHERE THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT IS IN THE STATUTE IT'S EXPECTED. WE WANT TO MAINTAIN THE GRANT LEVELS NOT HAVE THEM DECLINE EVERY YEAR. AND THE- THE LEGISLATURE THEN WOULD HAVE THE PREROGATIVE AND NEGOTIATE WITH THE GOVERNOR ON A REGULAR BASIS TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE WHETHER NOT TO PROVIDE THAT COAL OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THE GOVERNOR COMPOSED THEIR BUDGET. BUT THE LACK OF THAT I THINK PUTS OF THE LEGISLATURE IN. A WEAKER POSITION AND I THINK WE WANT TO PUT THE LEGISLATURE IN A STRONGER POSITION GOING FORWARD TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THIS DEBATE ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND THAT THAT MONEY IS ASSUME THAT IT'S GOING TO BE PROVIDED THE LEGISLATURE AND TE GOVERNOR. AND THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE BILL THAT INCREASED INTO THE- INTO THE BUDGET ON A REGULAR BASIS. I'M AND LASTLY I'VE BEEN ASKED TO ADDRESS. AN ISSUE THAT I THINK WE'VE SEEN WE'VE HEARD DISCUSSED BY. BY RECIPIENTS WHEN THEY TESTIFIED IT VARIES HEARING YOU MAY HEAR A BIT OF MORE OF IT TODAY WHEN THEY COME ON IN A FEW MINUTES. AND THAT IS THAT- WE HEAR STORIES OF THAT NGUYEN WE PROVIDE GRANT INCREASES TO- THE RECIPIENTS. THAT THEY OFTEN DON'T SEE MUCH OF THAT ACTUALLY IN THEIR CHECK. AND THERE AND- AND THERE ARE. AND THERE'S A REASON FOR THAT AND THAT IS THAT MANY. MANY RECIPIENTS ARE GOOD NUMBER OF RECIPIENTS LIVING HOUSING WHERE. THE COST OF THEIR HOUSING IS A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME SO AS WE DO THE RIGHT THING INCREASE PEOPLE'S. GRANT AMOUNTS- A HOUSING PROVIDER MAYBE TAKE AN INCREASING PERCENTAGE TAKING THAT SAME PERCENTAGE. SO WE ALL FEEL GOOD AND WE SHOULD ABOUT WHAT WE DO IN TERMS OF INCREASING GRANTS. BUT AT THE FOR THE RECIPIENT IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THEIR LIFE- AND SO- YEAH IT'S GREAT THAT THEY SAY HOUSE- BUT IT'S NOT REALLY GETTING TO WHERE THEY- GETTING MORE DOLLARS IN THEIR POCKET. TO ALLOW THEM TO MEET THE ESCALATING COSTS THAT WERE THERE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW. SIMILARLY WHEN WE SEE A GRAND INCREASED WHAT A GRAND INCREASE COMES THROUGH. IT ALSO HAS THE EFFECT OF SLIGHTLY REDUCING CALFRESH AMOUNTS. AND YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU WORK. VERY HARD A FEW YEARS AGO. AND THE COUNTIES WORKED REALLY HARD AND CDSS WORKED REALLY HARD. AND WHAT WE'VE DONE A REMARKABLE JOB GETTING ASSISTS. CALFRESH TESTIFY RECIPROCAL THINK WERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND RECIPIENTS NOW- WHICH IS. REALLY A REMARKABLE ACCOMPLISHMENT AND ONE THAT WE DON'T TAKE ENOUGH CREDIT FOR. BUT WHEN WE INCREASE THE SFI- AMOUNT IN JANUARY WE HEARD VERY QUICKLY FROM RECIPIENTS THAT WHEN THEY WERE COMING IN FOR THE RENEWALS. FOR A RECERTIFICATION FOR CALPERS. THEY WERE GETTING YOU KNOW A TEN DOLLAR MONTH CUT A FIFTEEN DOLLAR A MONTH CUT. IN THEIR CALFRESH AMOUNTS BECAUSE WE GAVE PEOPLE MORE INCOME. NOT THAT'S JUST THE LAW COUNTIES AREN'T DOING ANYTHING WRONG HERE THIS IS JUST THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS- BUT YOU KNOW THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO I THINK THAT. WOULD BE AN ALTERNATIVE OR SOMETHING FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S CONSIDERATION. WHICH IS LAST YEAR WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE GOLDEN STATE GRANT. TO TO SSI COWART'S RECIPIENTS AND I JUST WANT TO SAY PARENTHETICALLY. THAT THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES DID AN OUTSTANDING JOB. M. COUNTIES IN GETTING OUT THE COWART'S GRANTS AMBIANCES SITE GRANTS. VERY EFFECTIVELY VERY QUICKLY WITH ALMOST NO PROBLEMS. SO YOU KNOW WE CAN DO THIS. AND THE BEAUTY OF PROVIDING THE ONE TIME PAYMENTS. LIKE THE GOLDEN STATE GRANT LAST YEAR. WAS THAT. BECAUSE IT'S A ONE TIME PAYMENT. IT'S NOT TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BY HOUSING PROVIDER BECAUSE IT'S NOT AN INCREASE IN THE GRANT. IT'S JUST A ONE TIME PAYMENT THE GOES INTO PEOPLE'S ACCOUNTS. SO DOESN'T REDUCE PEOPLE OR. DOESN'T INCREASE PEOPLE'S RENT. ALL IT DOESN'T GET INTO ACCOUNT. FOR COVERAGE PURPOSES. SO THE GRANT FOR CALFRESH STAYS THE SAME. SO THERE'S A REAL ADVANTAGE I THINK IN SOMETHING FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WE LOVE THE GETTING WE REALLY INSIST ON GETTING HIGHER GRANT AMOUNTS WE THINK THAT IS THE COURSE. OVER THE LONG HAUL TO GET THERE BUT WE THINK IN A TIME OF SURPLUS WHERE WE HAVE A LOT OF EXTRA MONEY WERE IN A PANDEMIC WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND MONEY. THAT THOSE DOLLARS GETTING IN THE HANDS OF COMMERCE INNOCENCE I RECIPIENTS IS A VERY VERY WISE POLICY CHOICES. AND WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO. CONSIDER ADDING THAT INTO THE BUDGET IS WE GET TO THE MAY REVISE. SO WITH THAT OLD CONCLUDE MY CAUGHT MY COMMENTS THANK. WITH THAT I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DÍAS FOR QUESTIONS AND KEEP IT HERE AT THE CHAIR. I'D LIKE TO STICK WITH THE SS I SS P. GRANT LEVELS FOR THE FIRST NUMBER OF QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE- I'M GOING TO ASK BOTH THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES AND THE L. A. L. TO SEE IF THERE'S A CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SSI. S. S. P. GRANT LEVELS AND THE ENTRY INTO THE SS I SS P. PROGRAM. HOPING YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THOSE TWO. JACQUI RESTED WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH DSS- TO DIG DEEPER ON THIS QUESTION BUT JUST AN INITIAL POT- IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION IS. THE GRANT LEVELS THEMSELVES SERVE AS THE INCOME THRESHOLD- AT MY CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. I'M SO IMPLICIT SO DIRECTLY THAT IN AND OF ITSELF IS AN ELIGIBILITY ROLE SO TO THE EXTENT THAT GRANT LEVELS ARE KEEPING UP WITH INFLATION. IN A WAY- WE'RE JUST- ELIGIBILITY IS THAN JUST FURTHER ERODING OVER TIME AND IT'SJUST BEING REDUCED TO THE MOST POOR- AND- PER PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AND OLDER ADULTS- SAID THAT'S A DYNAMIC- WITH HOW THE GRANT LEVEL SPECIFICALLY TRANS. HOW DO THEY TRANSLATE INTO THE ELIGIBILITY SIDE OF THINGS. I GUESS FOR THE DEPARTMENT AND FOLLOWING UP WITH THE CASELOAD TREND ANALYSIS THAT'S ON THE TOP OF PAGE TWENTY FOUR. DO WE FEEL THAT THIS- IS FURTHER A ROADING ELIGIBILITY. IS THIS WHY WE'RE HAVING THE LOWER CASELOAD. TREND THAT WE'VE SEEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR FOR THE- CONNECTION POINT YEAH WE DO THINK THAT THAT IS ONE THING THAT MIGHT BE DRIVING KEITHSBURG REDUCTION IS THE FACT THAT THE DESTRUCTIVE SAID- THE INCOME ELIGIBILITY LIMIT IS THE MAXIMUM. BUT THERE ARE SOME DISREGARD BUT IT'S BASICALLY THE MAXIMUM GRANT AMOUNT EQUALS THE ELIGIBILITY FOR INCOME. HOWEVER THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS THAT WE THINK- HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE IN CASE WE DO THINK THAT THE CLOSURE OF THE ATHLETIC FIELD OFFICES FOR IT NOW AT THIS POINT. LITTLE VER TWO YEARS- MAY BE CONTRIBUTING AND MAY MAKE IT MORE CHALLENGING FOR PEOPLE TO GET ON TO TESTIFY AT THE PEAK- WE DO THINK THAT THERE ARE- ALSO SOME POSITIVE REASONS THAT THE KIDS BOOK ARTICLE WRITING IN. TERMS OF GREATER AFTER THE HEALTHCARE AND HEALTH INSURANCE FOR PEOPLE- VEHICLE LOCATION SERVICES THAT MAY BE REDUCING THE IMPACT OF FROM DISABILITIES. AND ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY THAT MIGHT BE MAKING IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO. PAY EMPLOYEES AND HAVE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION I'M BUT WE DO AGREE THAT- BOTH THE INCOME LIMITS AND BE OUT THAT LIMITS WITHIN THE AT THE STATE- EIGHTEEN WITH AN EFFORT BY PROGRAMS. LIKELY CONTRIBUTE TO CASE BY. CASE OF THE QUITE WELL CONVERSE WE HAD- EARLIER WITH. REGARD TO USE POVERTY AND HOW HOME. AND HOURS. THAT I'D LIKE TO REALLY. I'M SORRY FOR THE LABORING THE POINT BUT ARE WE ARTIFICIALLY RESTRICTING ACCESS TO THIS PROGRAM. WITH THE SUPPRESSION OF THE GRANT LEVELS BY NOT PROVIDING THE S. S. P. COLA PORTION OF THE GRANT. HAPPY TO HAVE CONTINUED CONVERSATION ABOUT THE- IN DETAIL ON GOING- ACCEPTABILITY OF THE COLOR BUT I DO WANT TO DEFER TO MY- SLOWLY GET FINANCE ABOUT THE FISCAL IMPLICATIONS ABOUT ONGOING- WHOLE INCREASED AND I WHICH IS- MENTIONED THAT. WITH REGARD TO OLDER ADULTS AND HOMELESSNESS WE HAVE BEEN MAKING TREMENDOUS IMPACT- AND INCREASES IN OUR HOUSING SPENDING OVER THE LAST- LAST YEAR TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS. ANOTHER TWO BILLION DOLLARS IS- APPROACH FOR THIS YEAR AND- WITHIN FIGURE IT OUT BUT SELL WE'VE BEEN SIGNIFICANT FUNDING DIRECTED TOWARD OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES TO TRY TO MELIORATE COMMITTEES PROBLEMS AND. WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE CON. YEAH I GET THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- JUST PROVIDES THE- THE PROPOSAL TO INCREASE CURRENT LEVELS IN LINE WITH THE INTENT OF THE- LANGUAGE PROPOSED- AT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT HAPPY TO HAVE ANY. FURTHER CONVERSATIONS. AS THIS IS A COR PROGRAM THAT HELPS US TO SERVE OUR AGE TURN BLIND AND DISABLED RESIDENTS IN THE STATE. I'M VARIAS INTERESTED IN THE RE INSTITUTION OF THE COLA AS A GOOD FAITH EFFORTS TO KEEP GRANT SET PACE WITH INFLATION AND TUITION ENSURE THAT THE ENTRY POINTS TO THE PROGRAM IS MAINTAINED SO THAT WE ARE NOT ARTIFICIALLY SUPPRESSING ELIGIBILITY FOR THIS BASIC NEEDS PROGRAM. HI TO I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THOSE CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS BUT WANTED TO PUT THAT ON THE RECORD. WITH THAT WE WILL CONCLUDE AND THANK THIS PANEL AND NOW TRANSITION OVER TO. PUBLIC COMMENT. BEFORE WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT I AM GOING TO MAKE A QUICK REQUEST FROM THE CHAIR TWO OF ON. FIRST THEY ARE BOTH NOTED ON PAGE TWENTY SIX OF THE AGENDA BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK STAFF TO WORK WITH THE L. A. AND DSS. IN REVIEWING THE COSTS AND LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO REINSTITUTE THE STATE COLA FOR SSI S. S. P. GRANTS I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO DIRECT. STAFF TO WORK WITH THE L. A. AND DSS TO DRAFT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO REQUIRING A PURCHASING POWER DISPLAY SHOWING THE TRENDS OF THESE SS I SS P. GRANT AMOUNTS AGAINST INFLATION. WHICH WILL ALSO AID IN UNDERSTANDING THE CHANGES IN BUDGET DOCUMENTS IN JANUARY AND MAY ANNUALLY. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD OPEN ALL OF THE OTHER BUDGET ISSUES PENDING ACTION AT THE MAY REVISION HEARINGS. WE WILL NOW. MOVE ON TO OUR PUBLIC COMMENT AND AS A REMINDER WE WELCOME PUBLIC COMMENT ON ANY ISSUE WHICH IS IN THE AGENDA WE DO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC. COMMENT AND THEREFORE I WANT TO URGE YOU TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF SO THAT WE CAN HEAR FROM EVERYONE. WE WILL START WITH IN PERSON PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE HEARING ROOM IF YOU CAN. COME FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE AND MAKE YOUR COMMENT. THANK YOU CHAIR ARAMBULA- I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR ADULT DAY SERVICES. WE HAVE SUBMITTED A REQUEST TO THIS COMMITTEE FOR SIXTY ONE POINT FOUR MILLION IN ONE TIME GRANT FUNDING FOR ADULT DAY SERVICES PROGRAMS- IN ORDER FOR. THESE FACILITIES TO HARDEN THEIR INFECTION CONTROL AND BE PREPARED FOR WHEN SHE'S AT THE- SEABASS IN THE EIGHTY H. SEYIN THAT DON'T THEY SERVICE PARTICIPANTS ARE READY TO COME BACK INTO CONGREGATE IN PERSON. CARE SETTINGS THE GRANTS COULD ALSO BE USED TO ADDRESS THE WORK FORCE SHORTAGE ISSUE WHICH IS PARTICULARLY PROFOUND FOR FACILITIES. BECAUSE THEY DO HAVE MINIMUM STAFFING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO NURSING HOMES IN TERMS OF OUR ENDS. SOCIAL WORKERS OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS OTHER PROFESSIONAL STAFF AND THEY ARE SIMPLY UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE COMPETITIVE OF WAGES OR I SHOULD SAY LACK OF COMPETITIVE THEIR WAGES BEING LACK. OF COMPETITIVE BECAUSE OF BE OF HOSPITALS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE INSTITUTIONS THAT CAN PAY MORE FOR THE STAFF AND WE KNOW THAT THE MARKET RATE- LABOR RATE IS EXTREMELY HIGH RIGHT NOW SO. IT WOULD BE USED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PURPOSES AND ALSO TO ADDRESS WORKFORCE SHORTAGE NEEDS AND WE ARE JUST URGING PLEASE AT THE- COMMITTEE ATOP THE REQUEST THANK YOU. THANK YOU KERNAN ON BEHALF OF LEADING H. CALIFORNIA AND AS PARTNERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT TWO ITEMS TODAY FIRST- ABOUT WORK FORCE WHICH CAME UP SEVERAL TIMES TODAY- LEADING AGES WORKING WITH H. CHI TO CREATE TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS AND HOME HEALTH AID WORKERS AND WE'RE HOPING FOR CURRENT YEAR FUNDING TO GET THAT STARTED IMMEDIATELY THE ONE THING WE KNOW IS THAT THERE IS FUNDING NEEDED FOR A CAMPAIGN TO GET TO PEOPLE WHO NEED TO BE RECRUITED AND THAT IS LOOKING AT- DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVE OF PEOPLE WHO. ARE IMMIGRATING TO CALIFORNIA WHO MAY HAVE EXPERIENCE IN THEIR COUNTRIES BUT CAN'T MAKE THEIR WAY AND NEED TRAINING LANGUAGE SERVICES AND SO WE ARE ASKING FOR TWENTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEAR PERIOD TO DEVELOP THIS CAMPAIGN IN ADDITION WE HEARD A LOT TODAY ABOUT DISASTER PREPAREDNESS- LEADING AGE IS WORKING WITH A COALITION OF INDIVIDUALS ORGANIZATIONS ON DEVELOPING THE LONG TERM CARE MUTUAL AID PROGRAM THIS IS THROUGH CAL- YES AND BUT HHS AND DEPARTMENT OF AGING ALL NEED TO BE A PART OF THIS BUT WHEN WE HAVE A DISASTER WHETHER IT'S CODED. OF FIRE WHERE YOU HAVE TO MOVE PEOPLE IN FIFTEEN MINUTES. THERE IS NO SYSTEM IN PLACE FOR SKILLED FACILITIES OR SYSTEM LIVING FACILITIES TO KNOW WHERE THEY CAN MOVE PEOPLE QUICKLY.
