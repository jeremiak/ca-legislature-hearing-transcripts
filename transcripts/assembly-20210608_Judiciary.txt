THE FED WELCOME ASSEMBLYMEMBER SMITH BACK TO THE COMMITTEE IS SITTING IN TODAY FOR MR GALLAGHER RIGHT OUR FIRST BILL IS ITEM NUMBER ONE SB FOUR FIFTY FOUR SENATOR BATES. ONE OF WELCOME. A GOOD MORNING- MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE AND THE SPONSOR ON TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS THAT I DID ACCEPT PRIOR TO THE HEARING THIS MORNING ON THE BILL SB FIVE FIFTY FOUR- FOR FIFTY FOUR WILL RAISE THE STATUTORY THRESHOLD FOR FILING GOVERNMENT CHILD SUPPORT PROPERTY AND PERSONAL LIENS FROM ONE MONTH SUPPORT TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS OR THREE MONTHS IN ARREARS CURRENTLY COUNTY CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES ARE REQUIRED BY STATUTE TO RECORD LEANS AGAINST REAL OR PERSONAL PROPERTY ANY TIME. A CHILD SUPPORT DEBTOR OWES MORE THAN ONE MONTH WORTH OF CHILD SUPPORT HOWEVER IN MOST CASES THE RECORDATION AND EVENTUAL RELEASE OF LEANS PRODUCES NO COLLECTION BECAUSE THE OBLIGATION HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID THIS IN FOR IN FOR ENFORCEMENT TOOL PROVIDES TO BE PROVED TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR VERY SMALL GROUP OF CASES THE MAJORITY OF PROPERTY LIENS COLLECTIONS DERIVE FROM CASES WITH ARREARS BALANCES OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR GREATER IN A MAJORITY OF CASES PARENTS PAYING SUPPORT STAY IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR SUPPORT ORDERS. BUT AS WE ALL KNOW THINGS HAPPEN IN LIFE AND SOMETIMES THE PAYMENT IS MADE A DAY LATE THE FILING OF A LEAN WHEN A PARENT IS ONLY ONE MONTH IN ARREARS IS NOT ONLY A BURDEN ON BOTH CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES BUT ON PARENTS WHO TYPICALLY PAY THEIR CHILD SUPPORT OBLIGATION ON TIME BY RAISING THE THRESHOLD FOR RECORDING LEANS FROM THE CURRENT ONE MONTH TO ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS OR THREE MONTHS IN ARREARS WOULD ELIMINATE OVER 70% OF THE LIENS BEING FILED. THE COST SAVINGS TO COUNTY AGENCIES IN IMPOSITION ON OTHERWISE PAYING SUPPORT A BELIEVE GORE'S WOULD BE SUBSTANTIAL WELL THE IMPACT TO COLLECTIONS IS EXPECTED TO BE MINIMAL I WOULD LIKE TO THANK RENATO EASKEY ADA THE CHIEF COUNSEL FOR THE ORANGE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES IN MARIE OURS OLA THE INTERIM DIRECTOR- OF ORANGE. COUNTY TO SERVICES FOR BEING WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR I DO HAVE THOSE TWO WITNESSES LISTED MARIA ARE SODA AND RONALDO'S GAITA. BOTH WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE ARE EITHER OF YOU HERE. YES WE ARE RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW TO GET THAT WILL TESTIFY OKAY. GO AHEAD PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AMBER NOT TO SKIP THE CHIEF ATTORNEY ORANGE COUNTY CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES AGENCY. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY THIS MORNING ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. HOW DO CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES ARE REQUIRED BY CURRENT STATUTE RECORD LEANS AGAINST REAL PROPERTY ANYTIME A CHILD SUPPORT DEBTOR OWES MORE THAN ONE MONTH'S WORTH OF CHILD SUPPORT. HOWEVER THE RECORD DACIAN AND EVENTUAL RELEASE OF LANES MAY NOT PRODUCE COLLECTION BECAUSE THE OBLIGATION HAS ALREADY BEEN PAID. PROPERTY LIENS PROVED TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR A VERY SMALL GROUP OF CASES. THE MAJORITY OF COLLECTIONS ARE OCCUR THANK CASES WITH THE REAR BALANCES OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR GREATER. FOLLOWING THE LEAN WHEN A PARENT IS ONLY ONE MONTH IN ARREARS IT'S A BIRD AND ON BOTH CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES AND PARENTS WHO TYPICALLY PAY THEIR SUPPORT OBLIGATION ON TIME AND TO STAY IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR SUPPORT ORDERS. EACH YEAR ORANGE COUNTY CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES RECORDS APPROXIMATELY SEVEN THOUSAND NEW LANES. AND RECEIVES OVER SEVEN THOUSAND REQUEST TO RELEASE LANES. OF THOSE RELEASES OVER 90% OR FOR A RELEASE OF LEAN FOR RICHARD INSTALLMENT MEANING THERE WAS NO MONEY OWED ON THE OBLIGATION. STOCK COSTS ORANGE COUNTY CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES OVER A HUNDRED AND FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR IN UNNECESSARY EXPENSE FOR STAFF TIME. STATEWIDE THAT WASTED EFFORT IS ESTIMATED TO BE ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION ADULT. S. B. FOUR FIFTY FOUR WITH THE MAN THE THRESHOLD FOR FILING LIENS TWO ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THREE MONTHS IN ARREARS WHICHEVER COMES FIRST. THIS WOULD REDUCE THE BURDEN ON CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES STATEWIDE ON ENFORCEMENT MEASURE WHICH HAS NOT PROVEN SUCCESSFUL. WITH THE MINIMAL IMPACT ON CHILD SUPPORT COLLECTIONS. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CHILD SUPPORT DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND I STAYED IN THEIR LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE. THEY SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THE MEASURE IN OUR SYSTEM AS WITH TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS. WE ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE ASSOCIATION AND ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THEIR AND PUT. ORANGE COUNTY IS PROUD TO SPONSOR SB FOUR FIFTY FOUR IT IS VERY APPRECIATIVE OF CENTERPIECES INTRODUCTION OF THE MEASURE. AS WELL AS FOR STAFF'S ENGAGEMENT. AND THE ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY STAFF WORK AND ASSISTANCE. SB FOUR FIFTY FOUR IT'S A COMMONSENSE APPROACH TO MANDATE A POLICY THAT IS NOT EFFECTIVE. THEREFORE THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS PURCHASE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. RIGHT AND I TAKE IT MARIE OUR SOUL IS NOT TESTIFYING. AT THIS TIME THANK YOU.

THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CONSULT. I'M GONNA SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY AND I'VE NEVER SUPPORTED AT ANYTHING THAT RELIEVES ANY TYPE OF CHILD SUPPORT OF PEOPLE REALIZED BUT I DO TAKE NOTE WITH A FEW THINGS THAT WERE SAID- IN THE DISCUSSION TO SUGGEST THAT EVEN A DAY LATE CHILD SUPPORT A DAY LATE HAS PROFOUND IMPACT ON- THAT THE RECIEVING- SPOUSE'S LIFE IT CAN MEAN THAT THERE THEN LATE FOR RENT IT CAN MEAN THAT YOU KNOW THEIR CAR GETS REPOSSESS SO I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT WE TALK ABOUT THIS IN A WAY. THAT RESPECTS- THE NEED FOR CHILD SUPPORT TO BE TIMELY EVERY SINGLE MONTH IT IS I UNDERSTAND ONEROUS TO DO A LEAN IF SOMETHING IS A DAY LATE BUT I DON'T IN ANY WAY WANT TO EXCUSE- THAT TYPE OF ACTION- OFTEN OFTEN DONE JUST TO BE OF. CRUEL IN FACT TO THE RECEIVING PARENTS SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S CLEAR BECAUSE THERE WERE A COUPLE- POINTS THAT WERE ACTED LIKE IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL AND SOMEBODY NORMALLY PAYS CHILD SUPPORT BUT IT IS IMPORTANT EVERY SINGLE MONTH CHILD SUPPORT ON TIME. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT'S JUST LIKE US GETTING OUR PAYCHECK LATE.

WELCOME GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT SB TWENTY FOUR WHICH MAKES REVISIONS TO THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER FORM TO PROTECT A CHILD SCHOOL MEDICAL AND DENTAL INFORMATION FROM AN ABUSIVE PARENT. THIS BILL REQUIRES THIRD PARTY INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS SCHOOLS DENTAL OFFICES OR MEDICAL OFFICES TO DEVELOP PROTOCOLS WHEN THEY RECEIVE A COPY OF SUCH A COURT RESTRAINING ORDER. I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU A TRAGIC DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE THAT WAS THE CATALYST FOR SB TWENTY FOUR IT BEGINS WITH THE YOUNG MOTHER CALLIE WHO LIVED IN MADERA WITH THEIR THREE YOUNG BOYS ALL UNDER THE AGE OF SIX. KELLY LEFT HER HUSBAND IN MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY AFTER YEARS OF BRUTAL PHYSICAL EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ABUSE BECAUSE OF THE EMOTIONAL ABUSE SHE WAS ISOLATED FROM HER FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND WAS AFRAID FOR THE SAFETY OF HER VOICE AND FRANKLY BELIEVE THAT- THERE WAS NO ONE THERE TO HELP HER. WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SUPPORT SHELTER SHE OBTAINED A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER AND WENT INTO HIDING WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND FINALLY CONTACTED HER FAMILY FOR HELP. AFTER SUCCESSFULLY HIDING FOR HER HUSBAND FROM HER HUSBAND FOR THREE MONTHS AND GETTING HELP FOR HER AND HER BOYS CAL IMADE AN APPOINTMENT AT A LOCAL HEALTH CLINIC. THE CLINIC CALL TO CONFIRM THE APPOINTMENT AND CALLED KELLY'S HUSBAND. ON HIS CELL PHONE SO THAT HE INADVERTENTLY LEARNED AT THE TIME AND THE LOCATION OF THE APPOINTMENT ON JULY FOURTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY CALORIES A STRANGE STRANGE AND VIOLENT HUSBAND DROVE TO THE CLINIC WAITED IN THE PARKING LOT WHEN SHE ARRIVES SHOT AND KILLED HER IN BROAD DAYLIGHT AND SHE SHIELDED THEIR THREE YOUNG CHILDREN FROM THE BULLETS. I BRING KELLY STORY TO YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE IN THE REALM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THIS LEVEL OF CONTROL PLANNING AND PERPETUAL VIOLENCE IS UNFORTUNATELY NO NOT IN AND CALL. A IT IS PROJECTED THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAS RAVAGED OUR COMMUNITIES AT EVEN HIGHER RATES. SINCE THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC. FOR THOSE IN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS THE RISKS THEY FACE FEET FACE IN LEAVING THEIR PARTNERS MAY BE JUST AS DANGEROUS AS THE RISK OF STAYING PUT. UP 275% OF ABUSED WOMEN. WHO ARE MURDERED ARE KILLED AFTER THEY LEAVE THEIR PARTNER'S. VIOLENT PERPETRATORS TO MURDER THEIR EX PARTNERS GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO TRACT TRACT THEIR VICTIMS AND ONE STRATEGY. UTILIZED BY ABUSIVE PARTNERS IS TO TRACK THE LOCATION OF THE SHARED SHARED CHILDREN. THIS IS WHY OBTAINING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER IS VITAL TO SURVIVORS. THE PROTECTIVE ORDERS REQUIRE THE PERPETRATOR TO REFRAIN FROM HAVING ANY CONTACT WITH THE VICTIM AND THEIR CHILDREN. CURRENTLY A JUDGE CAN GRANT A MULTITUDE OF DIFFERENT PROTECTIONS FOR THE ABUSE PARTY. INCLUDING ORDERS THAT PROTECT THE MEDICAL AND SCHOOL INFORMATION OF THE SHARE CHILDREN. HOWEVER WHILE A JUDGE ALREADY HAS THIS DISCRETION THERE'S NO PLACE ON THE ACTUAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER FORM. THEREFORE WHEN A PROTECTIVE ORDER IS PRINTED AND GIVEN TO THE PARTIES INVOLVED. IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY STATE SAY THAT SCHOOL MEDICAL OR DENTAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE SHARED CHILDREN BE PROTECTED FROM THE PERPETRATOR. THIS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR A SCHOOL OR MEDICAL OFFICE TO ENFORCE IF THERE'S NO CLEAR LANGUAGE STATING OTHERWISE. THEN THESE THIRD PARTY INSTITUTIONS WILL NOT DENY APPARENT THEIR LEGAL RIGHT TO INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR CHILD WHICH IS. IF THIS YOU KNOW THE WHOLE IDEA OF A PARENT HAVING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR CHILDREN IS REALLY A SACRED RIGHT IN. IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO- IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO DECIDE AS A JUDGE THAT YOU WANT. TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN AND THEIR WHEREABOUTS- INCLUDING DENTAL AND MEDICAL VISITS AND OF AN APPOINTMENT. THEN THAT THERE SHOULD BE A PLACE ON THE FORM THAT MAKES IT VERY EASY TO CHECK OFF AND- AND BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE- THE ESCAPING FAMILY MEMBERS. WE HAVE TO OFFER MORE PROTECTION FOR PEOPLE LIKE KELLY SB TWENTY FOUR IS A SIMPLE STEP TO OFFER BETTER PROTECTION. FOR SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THEIR CHILDREN. WITH ME TODAY IS SERRA RODRIGUEZ KELLY'S COUSIN. WHO WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS AND DAN BT FROM THE ALEXANDRA ADVOCACY GROUP TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU I DO HAVE THE TWO WITNESSES SIR ROD REGUS WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE AND DAN BEATTIE. ALSO WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE SERRA RODRIGUEZ. YES THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING ME TODAY I APOLOGIZE FOR MY VOICE. I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME CLEARLY BUT FIRST I WOULD AGAIN LIKE TO THANK THE SENATORS AND THEIR STAFF AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT HELPED. AND SUPPORTED CALLIPHORIDAE FOUR. HIGHER THAN A MEETING PERSON I KNOW WE ALWAYS SAY THAT ABOUT PEOPLE. QALQILYA AS- KELLY LET ROOM HER LAST WAS FELT BY IT MATTERS NOT CONTAINS. AFTER MANY OF ABUSE PHYSICAL MENTAL EMOTIONAL ABUSE CALIFORNIA COURAGE TO ASK FOR HELP. HONESTLY I THINK THAT COURAGE CAME FROM BEING A MOM- PETER HAD BROKERS SO FAR. BUT I THINK. BEING A MOM DAY PROJECT TO BETTER HELP SOMETHING TO SLEEP FOR. WHEN WE HELP TRANSLATE ON MAY FIFTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY JUST OVER A YEAR AGO. SHE WAS ALMOST UNRECOGNISABLE SHE WOULDN'T MAKE EYE CONTACT SHE WOULDN'T HARDLY SPEAK LESS YOU ASKED SOMETHING. EVEN THEN SHE HAD NO OPINION AND MADE NO COMPLAINT AND SHE APOLOGIZED FOR EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING. BUT WHEN SHE INTERACTED WITH THE BOYS YOU COULD BE HER. STILL IN THEIR PLEASE WITH THEM FOR MONTHS AT A TIME. AND JUST LISTENING TO THE HORRIFIC STORIES OF THINGS HE HAD DONE. THINGS YOU'LL ONLY SEE ON TV. SHE TOLD SHE WAS CALLED EVERY DAY HER ONLY PURPOSE BUT THIS THERE CAN. BE COUNTY NEW THAT WASN'T SURE SHE KNEW HER PRACTICE SUCH PROJECTED SOMETHING. KELLY SAID HER BIGGEST FEAR. AND WHAT MADE HER FINAL ME BUT THAT ISSUE DEFINITELY. WOULD KILL THEM ALL SHE WANTED TO END THE CYCLE OF ABUSE SHE LOVED HER CHILDREN AND DID NOT WANT THERE. EVER BE A CHANCE THAT THEY CAN GROW UP ANYTHING LIKE HIM SHE WANTED HER CHILDREN TO KNOW WHAT A LOVING FAMILY WAY. OF LIFE AND WOULDN'T LIKE TO BE A KID. THE LONGER SHE WAS FREE THE MORE SHE WAS RECOGNIZED AGAIN NOT BY JUST US BUT SHE COULD RECOGNIZE YOURSELF AGAIN. YOU CAN SEE HER FIGHTING. COULD BE CREATION. SHEILA YOU THAT IF YOU'RE FOR HER AND HER KIDS HER FAMILY WITH PEOPLE SHEILA AND PEOPLE WHO LOVE THEM. SHE WAS ABLE TO FINALLY TELL HER TREE AND BEGIN HEALING. SHE WAS SO MAKING OF GLOBALIZATION SHE WAS STAYING IN A WOMEN'S SHELTER AND SPOKE HERE. YEAH SHE WAS EXTREMELY CAREFULLY GOING TO COURT HAS TO BE DONE BECAUSE INTO DATE PREPARE. JUST THE STATE. ON JULY FOURTH TWENTY TWENTY. KELLY HAD AN APPOINTMENT CAMARENA HEALTH PLAN EMPLOYEE HAD TOLD HER ESTRANGED HUSBAND OF HER APPOINTMENT.

MISTER KALRA. THANK YOU- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SENATOR FROM THIS FORWARD- I HAVE A RESOLUTION THAT IS LIKELY NOT TO BE TAKEN UP FOR A VOTE OF REGARDING- IT'S SORT OF MORE DIRECT IN TERMS THE CONDUCT OF ICE AND- ICE'S ROLE- IN IN TERRORIZING OUR COMMUNITIES IN BECOMING A ROGUE- THE- ARM. OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- UNDER. NO IT'S BIPARTISAN UNDER BOTH DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS WE'VE SEEN THAT KIND OF CONDUCT- AND I APPRECIATE THIS RESOLUTION BECAUSE ONCE AGAIN IT'S CALLING US THING I THINK WE'VE CALLED ON FOR A VERY LONG TIME. WHICH IS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF IMMIGRANTS I TO OUR STATE TO OUR NATION- I JUST SEE IT AND IT WILL CERTAINLY BE IN THE SUPPORTING IT I JUST HOPE THAT- YOU KNOW THIS IS A WEIRD KIND OF. WE'RE RUNNING IN CIRCLES ALL THE TIME IT COMES IMMIGRATION REFORM BECAUSE DC AND ESPECIALLY IF- YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IF. DEMOCRATS ARE ARE WILLING TO GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER IT JUST SEEMS LIKE YOU KNOW PEOPLE WILL TALK ABOUT IT MORE AND- NOTHING WILL HAPPEN AND SO I'M HOPING AT LEAST GIVEN THE FACT THAT AS A STATE. THAT WE HAVE THE INFLUENCE AND WAIT THAT WE DO. THAT AT LEAST MAKING THE STATEMENT ONCE AGAIN- THAT- YOU KNOW IMMIGRANTS MATTER- HAS SOMETIME BACK BUT IN THE MEANTIME I THINK WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO LOOK AT OUR INTERACTIONS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF BILLS I THINK FALL UNDER THE WIDER UMBRELLA OF WHAT YOU'RE CALLING FOR BOTH IN TERMS OF. TERMINOLOGY THAT'S USING TERMS INTERACTIONS YOU KNOW WITH OUR SUMMER CREEL'S VISION ACT AND HOW WE INTERACT. WITH ICE AND SO- WITH THIS PARTICULAR RESOLUTION I HOPE THAT THAT WE CAN. REALLY PUSH THE TYPES OF VERY DIRECT POLICY INTERACTION OR POLICY LEGISLATION AND INTERACTING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- THAT ACTUALLY LEADS TO TREATING- ARE IMMIGRANTS MORE DIGNITY. SO I JUST OF. THEM I GUESS PART OF MY FRUSTRATION BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN COMMUNITIES AND- IT'S LIKE WE TALK A LOT ABOUT IT THE QUESTION IS WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT IT AND I THINK THIS PLAYS OUT. IN A WIDE MENU OF OPTIONS OF THINGS. THAT WE CAN DO AND THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE CALLING FOR. THANK YOU THREATS. THANK CENTER FOR THIS I- AYE PRE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAINTAINING THE FAMILY STRUCTURE A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP AND ALSO THE DUE PROCESS FOR ALL OF OUR IMMIGRANTS AND I THINK THAT HAVING THOSE THREE PARTS IN YOUR RESOLUTION IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THE PATHWAY TO- COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YEARS- I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THESE ARE CALIFORNIA'S VALUES. I THINK ALL POLLS INDICATE THAT THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT CALIFORNIA VALUES ARE AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DAY WHEN IT BECOMES AMERICA'S VALUES AND THAT CONGRESS ACTS ON IT THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. RIGHT SIGNALED CENTER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I JUST WANNA. I JUST WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT LOOK THE COMMENT I HEAR THE MOST IS THAT- PEOPLE SUPPORT IMMIGRATION AS LONG AS THEY FOLLOW THE LAW AND COME IN LEGALLY. AND THAT IS SAID IN A CONTEXT WHERE IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. TO COME IN LEGALLY BECAUSE OFTENTIMES IT TAKES AS FAR AS FIFTEEN YEARS. TO GO THROUGH THE LEGALIZATION PROCESS AND- IF YOU'RE IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY. OFTEN OF SEEKING EITHER ASYLUM. OR SEEKING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. FIFTEEN YEARS IS JUST UNTENABLE- ONE MY FATHER CAME TO UNITED STATES IN NINETEEN FORTY NINE HE CROSSED LEGALLY AT THE BORDER GOVERNOR OF PERMIT. AND HE DECIDED IN NINETEEN. FIFTY TO THAT HE WANT TO BECOME A CITIZEN IT TOOK HIM A FEW MONTHS TO BECOME CITIZEN. NINETEEN FIFTY TWO. AND- IT TOOK MONTHS. AND IT IT'S A HARD DECISION FOR- PEOPLE TO COME FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY TO SAY I'M GOING TO CHANGE MY SERVICE ON THIS SHIP. BUT IN THAT TIME MY FATHER WAS A VERY PRODUCTIVE MEMBER. OF THE OF THE UNITED STATES HE WAS HE BECAME A BUSINESS NOT A VERY SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS OWNER. HE BECAME A LEADER IN THE COMMUNITY. AND. A VERY OF- AND PART OF OUR COMMUNITY OF COURSE OUR FAMILY WE WERE ALL BORN HERE AND WE ALSO ARE ALSO PROUD TO BE AMERICAN CITIZENS AND PART OF THIS WONDERFUL COUNTRY. AND THAT THAT SHOULD BE A PROCESS THAT SHOULD BE. EASIER TO NAVIGATE THAN HAVING TO WAIT TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AND SO. HOPEFULLY WE COULD AT LEAST AT SOME POINT COUNT FOR THE DROP IN DHAKA THERE ALREADY IN OUR COUNTRY. PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY ABIDING BY THE LAW AND TRYING TO THE STATE TOGETHER WITH THEIR FAMILIES TO SEEK OPPORTUNITY AT THE VERY LEAST. WE SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR THEM TO START- TO PASS A REFORM. THAT WILL SUCCESSFULLY INCORPORATE THEM- LEGALLY INTO OUR SOCIETY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND THE MOTION IS THAT THE RESOLUTION BE ADOPTED CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE AYE STONE AYE CHOW. CHOW I CHIU. DAVIES AB SNOW GONZALEZ GONZALEZ I HOLDEN.

FOR GERMAN MEMBERS IT'S AN HONOR TO BE BACK ON THE GREEN CARPET AND- VISITING TO YOU TODAY SB FIVE SEVENTY EIGHT. WHICH CAR FIVE THE CONSERVATORSHIP PROCEEDINGS UNDER THE LETTERMAN BEATRICE SHORT ACT ARE TO BE HELD IN CLOSED COURT UNLESS THE SUBJECT OF THE PETITION. DEMANDS IT TO BE PUBLIC. SORTS INVERSES SUPERIOR COURT HOLDS LPS CONSERVATORSHIP PROCEEDINGS ARE INHERENTLY NON PUBLIC DESPITE THIS LEGAL PRECEDENT THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT SOME COURTS CONTINUE TO HEAR THESE SINCE THE PROCEEDINGS IN OPEN COURT. THIS PUTS BOTH INDIVIDUALS CONFIDENTIAL MEDICAL INFORMATION AND THEIR PERSONAL REPUTATION AT RISK. THE STATE AUDITOR'S FINDINGS MAKE IT CLEAR THAT COURTS NEED MORE EXPLICIT DIRECTION IN ORDER TO STANDARDIZE CONSERVATIVE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS ACROSS THE STATE. SB FIVE SEVENTY EIGHT SECURES THE PRIVACY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS BY ONLY ALLOWING THE SUBJECT OF THE PROCEEDING TO DEMAND IT TO BE PUBLIC. HOWEVER THIS BILL STILL ALLOWS OTHER PARTIES TO REQUEST A HEARING TO BE PUBLIC IF A JUDGE FINDS A PUBLIC INTEREST OUTWEIGHS THE SUBJECTS PRIVACY INTEREST. FOR THE MORE CONTINUE TO WORK ON LANGUAGE WITH THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE ALL WANT WHAT IS BEST FOR THE CONSERVATIVE. I HAVE WITNESSES ON THE LINE FROM THE DEPRESSION AND BIPOLAR SUPPORT ALLIANCE WHO CAN SHARE THE IMPORTANT ROLE PRIVACY PLEASE WHEN DISCUSSING SENSITIVE MEDICAL INFORMATION. THANK YOU STRUCTURE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND SO I HAVE ONE WITNESS LISTED PAUL SIMONS WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE ARE YOU WITH US.

ACCOUNT 490% OF THE NATION'S SUICIDES EVERY YEAR AND COST TWENTY THREE BILLION IN LOST WORK DAYS AND OTHER WORKPLACE ISSUES. EPSA CALIFORNIA HERE SO IT ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION. FOR CALIFORNIA BASED CHAPTERS. SB FIVE SEVEN IT WOULD REQUIRE A HEARING HELD UNDER LOOK AT FACTS BE PRESUMPTIVELY CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC BUT WOULD AUTHORIZE YOU INDIVIDUAL WHO IS THE SUBJECT OF THE PROCEEDINGS DEMAND THAT THE PUBLIC HEARING. AND HEARING THE PUBLIC AND BE HELD IN A PLACE IN THE FALL SUITABLE FOR TENNIS BY THE PUBLIC. THE DVSA CALIFORNIA SUPPORTS LEGISLATION GIVING PRIVACY TO THOSE WHO ARE SUBJECT TO HEARING ON YOUR LPS AND THE RIGHT. TO OPEN THE HEARING TO THE PUBLIC. I A PAYROLL ORGANISER OF MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMER WHICH- SUPPORT PRIVACY. AND PARTICULARLY SELF DETERMINATION. FOR THOSE WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY CONFIDENTIALITY ARE HALLMARKS OF HEALTHCARE AND THEIR CORE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS WE WOULD LIKE WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO KEEP OUR PERSONAL AFFAIRS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. IN THE CASE OF MENTAL ILLNESS PUBLIC AIRING. OF INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT PROCEEDING SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREASED STIGMA. HAVING A HEARING PLACE IN PUBLIC VIEW AGAINST THE WISHES OF THE SUBJECT THE CLERK ON DUTY STRUCTURES ON THE SUBJECT OF THE HEARING POSSIBLY INCITING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AND POSSIBLY LEADING TO INAPPROPRIATE COMMITMENTS. ON THE OTHER HAND KEEPING HEARING HADN'T HEARING HIDDEN FROM OTHERS AGAINST THE WISHES OF THE SUBJECT COULD ALSO BE A STRESSOR BY INCREASING FEELINGS OF ISOLATION AND HELPLESSNESS THEY'RE ALREADY EXTREMELY FRAGILE. INDIVIDUAL THE BILL WOULD AUTHORIZE THE INDIVIDUAL CONDUCTING A HEARING TO. ENCOURAGE REQUEST BY ANOTHER PARTY TO PROCEEDINGS MAKE THE CURRENT PUBLIC IF THEY FIND THAT THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS IN AN OPEN HEARING CLEARLY OUTWEIGHS THE INDIVIDUALS INTERESTED IN PRIVACY NOW WE RECOGNIZE THERE MAY BE INSTANCES WHERE THE PUBLIC INTEREST MIGHT SEEM TO OUTWEIGH. THAT INTEREST IN PRIVACY BUT AS THE SUBJECT OF THE HEARING HAS RIGHTS RIGHTS TO BE PROTECTED NOT JUST AN INTEREST AND WE DO TRUST THAT THE EVIDENCE TO OVERRULE THE SUBJECTS WISHES WILL BE COMPELLING. INDEED I THANK SENATOR FOR SUPPORTING RIGHTS OF THE MENTALLY ILL AT RISK. ASK YOUR ZIP OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU THIRTY ONE IN THE HEARING WHO'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE SEVENTY EIGHT. SEEING NONE THE REMOTE TESTIMONY STATION. SEE NON OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR ANYONE WHO'D LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FOR SB FIVE SEVENTY EIGHT WE ARE TAKING NAME AFFILIATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF SB FIVE SEVEN EIGHT YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. ONE AND THEN ZERO IF YOU'RE IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO ONE IN SUPPORT AT THIS TIME THANK YOU WILL MOVE TO OPPOSITION I HAVE NO OPPOSITION LISTED IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF SB FIVE SEVENTY EIGHT.

RIGHT THANK YOU ARE PRETTY MAY CLOSE THE LIGHTS ON WHEN TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MR TRUMP THANK YOU VERY MUCH HIS CHAIR I'M GOING TO ABSTAIN FROM VOTING TODAY AND URGED THE TWO SIDES TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATION- I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK WITH THE LATE OPPOSITION YESTERDAY THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT AND I'M- SYMPATHETIC TO HIS- ARGUMENTS SO AND I ALSO HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW THE MATERIALS AS WELL AS THE VIDEO- D. N. I LEARN A LOT MORE ABOUT THE- THIS THE HOLLYWOOD MENTAL HEALTH COURT HOUSING COURT ROOM- IN THAT IT YOU KNOW THE COURT ROOM IS VERY UNIQUE AND IN MANY REGARDS AND- FIRST OF ALL IT IS IT IS- THE ONLY. ARM COURT ROOM IN CALIFORNIA THAT DEALS EXCLUSIVELY WITH MENTAL HEALTH CASES. I HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT IS ALSO VERY CENTRALIZED IN THE SENSE THAT- IT COMBINES A LOT OF THE EXPERTISE ALL UNDER ONE ROOF. UP SO. NOW THEY HANDLE A LOT OF CASES UP OVER THE YEARS I THINK THE AVERAGE IS LIKE SIXTY CASES A DAY. AND YOU KNOW A LOT MORE THAN OTHER COURT ROOMS IN IN THE STATE. AND AS A RESULT- DAY YOU KNOW I THINK. COMPLYING WITH THE TERMS OF THIS LAW. WOULD BASICALLY CHANGE THE ON A DYNAMIC THE CENTRALIZATION. MODELS THAT THEY CURRENTLY HOUSE IN THAT THE STATE WOULD HAVE TO CONTACT YOU KNOW SEEK A SEPARATE COURT ROOM TO HANDLE SOME OF THESE CASES THAT THEY CURRENTLY HOUSE. WHICH WILL BREAK UP THAT CENTRALIZATION MODEL A WHICH IS VERY WHICH HAS PROVEN TO BE VERY EFFECTIVE. AND IN FACT THE CALL AT THE CROWN JEWEL YOU KNOW UP OF THIS PARTICULAR- CASE IS SO. CALM SO I LIKE I SAID I'M A LITTLE SYMPATHETIC TO THE ARGUMENTS. AND I AM. GOOD ASK PERHAPS. YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW THE TWO SIDES TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS RUSSIA AND I THINK THERE'S A WAY TO GET THERE AND IF NOT YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT THEY SUGGESTED SOME AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL AS WELL R. IF THOSE MEMBERS DON'T WORK AND I THINK PERHAPS WHAT YOU COULD DO IS TO PROBABLY. IMPLEMENT SOME KIND OF A DELAY IMPLEMENTATION POP LANGUAGE IN THE BILL SO THAT THEY WOULD BE ALLOWED MORE TIME TO CAN IMPLEMENT YOUR LAW AND I THINK DEFINITELY DOABLE THING TO DO SO WITH THAT I'M JUST GONNA ABSTAINED FROM FROM LOOKING TACKLE BUT I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO A VOTE OF FORD CAUGHT ON FLY. THANK YOU. THANKS THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SENATOR THANK YOU FOR BRINGING-THIS FORWARD I AM AWARE THAT THERE IS A COURT IN LOS ANGELES THAT IS IN OPPOSITION. THE PROBLEM IS WE HAVE A CASE OUT THERE THE SORENSON CASE. WHICH DICTATES HOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO RUN THAT THAT HEARING WERE RUN THAT COURTROOM AND THEY ARE FROM WHAT I CAN SEE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH IT. SO I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THE RULING OF THE COURTS NOR WITH WHAT YOUR BILL IS TRYING TO DO. AND ACTUALLY I WOULD ENCOURAGE LOS ANGELES TO THINK A LITTLE BIT HARDER ABOUT HOW THEY COME INTO COMPLIANCE. WITH WHAT IS IN FACT EXISTING LAW. TO WITH THAT SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND TO MISTER CHOW'S CONCERNS- OF COURSE- WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE WE WE'VE HAD VERY VIGOROUS CONVERSATIONS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS- THEY'VE INVITED ME TO COME DOWN AND TAKE A TOUR OF THE COURTS WHICH I INTEND TO DO WE HAD IT ON THE BOOKS BUT- THINGS GOT CHANGED UP SO- WE'RE GONNA BE GOING DOWN THERE AND- YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY BEFORE THEN THE SESSION TAKE A LOOK AT HOW THEY DO THINGS WE WILL CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. AT THE END OF THE DAY I THINK ALL OF US AGREE THAT THE NUMBER ONE. MOST IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS BILL IS THE CONSERVATIVE E. AND PROTECTING THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND THEIR PRIVACY. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS THANK YOU ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS CHOLERA PLEASE STAND BY STONE AYE CHAU. CHIU DAY. DAVEY I CONSULT. GONZALEZ I HOLDEN HOLDEN AYE KALRA KALRA AYE KILEY KILEY AYE MAIENSCHEIN RIESS SMITH. SMITH HI THANK YOU THE BILLS THAT FIGURES SHERMAN THANK YOU MEMBERS APPRECIATE YOURS- YOU'RE OUT THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR LEYVA THAT BRINGS US TO ITEM NUMBER SIX SB. THREE THIRTY ONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MEMBERS IT'S NICE TO SEE EVERYBODY. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ALL OF YOU BUT I FEEL LIKE IT'S ALREADY JUNE AND WERE ALREADY SWITCHING HOUSES AND PRESENTING OUR BILLS IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S GONE VERY FAST. ALL RIGHT I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THIS BILL AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS LISTED ON PAGE NINE OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATE BILL THREE THREE ONE ALSO KNOWN AS A SAM SNOW MORE ACT EXPANDS THE PROHIBITION ON NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS NDAS TO COVER A CIVIL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS INVOLVING ALL FORMS OF HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION. THIS BILL ALSO EXPANDS THE PROHIBITION ON OVERLY BROAD CONFIDENTIALITY AND NON DISPARAGEMENT CLAUSES IN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS TO COVER WORKERS WHO ARE REQUIRED TO FIND THESE TYPES OF CLASSES AS PART OF A SEVERANCE PACKAGE AGREEMENT. AS MANY OF YOU MAY REMEMBER I AUTHORED AND THEN GOVERNOR BROWN SIGNED SB EIGHT TWENTY ALSO KNOWN AS A STAND ACT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. SB EIGHT TWENTY SPECIFICALLY BANNED NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS IN CASES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT. SEXUAL ASSAULT AND SEXUAL DISCRIMINATION. IMPORTANTLY THE STAND ACT ALSO ALLOWS THE CLAIMANT TO REQUEST CONFIDENTIALITY IF THEY SO CHOOSE. IN PASSING THIS HISTORIC LAW THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZE THAT SETTLEMENTS SECRET SETTLEMENTS WERE HELPING TO PERPETRATE HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENTS BY ALLOWING COMPLAINTS TO BE SWEPT UNDER THE RUG. OF COURSE SECRET SETTLEMENTS PLACE MUCH A ROLE IN PERPETRATING WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT AND BIAS BASED ON RACE ETHNICITY SEXUAL ORIENTATION AGE DISABILITY AND RELIGION. BECAUSE HERE TO COMPLAINTS ARE KEPT SECRET AND THOSE WHO RAISE THE COMPLAINTS ARE EFFECTIVELY SILENCED. MEMBERS IT IS UNACCEPTABLE FOR ANY EMPLOYER TO TRY TO SILENCE WORKERS BECAUSE HERE SHE WAS THE VICTIM OF ANY TYPE OF HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION. THE SILENCE NO MORE ACT WILL EMPOWER SURVIVORS TO SPEAK OUT IF THEY SO WISH SO THE PERPETRATORS CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE WE CAN HOPEFULLY PREVENT ABUSERS FROM CONTINUING TO TORMENT AND ABUSE OTHER WORKERS. WORKERS SHOULD ALWAYS BE ABLE TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THIS DEPLORABLE BEHAVIOR IN THE WORKPLACE WELL TO DEMAND ACCOUNTABILITY AND TO RIP FUTURE ABUSES. BY PERPETRATORS HERE WITH ME TODAY REMOTELY TO SHARE HER OWN PERSONAL STORY AND EXPERIENCE IS THE FORMA AS SOMEWHAT. AS WELL AS PETER RECKON WITH THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU SENATOR I DO HAVE TWO WITNESSES LISTED PETER BROKEN. AND IF YOU'RE A SOBRE FROM RECEIVED BOTH WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE PETER ROQUAN. HI GOOD-MORNING- AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS RICK AND- I'M AN EMPLOYMENT ATTORNEY IN OAKLAND- OVER THE COURSE OF MY CAREER. I REPRESENTED EMPLOYERS PUBLIC ENTITIES EMPLOYEES IN A WIDE VARIETY OF EMPLOYMENT DISPUTES. REVIEWING AND NEGOTIATING SETTLEMENTS AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENT IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF MY PRACTICE- I'M HERE TODAY. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CLINTON LAWYERS ASSOCIATION AND ADMITTED THE SELLER'S ATTORNEY. TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF SB THREE THREE ONE. BUT WHILE NON DISPARAGEMENT CLAUSES AND SEVENTY GRAMS HAVE BECOME MORE COMMON. OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES- IN MY VIEW THEY HAVE LITTLE SOCIAL VALUE I'M JUST. IF I CAN'T USE ONE EXAMPLE- WHY SHOULD CALIFORNIANS LOOKING FOR A SAFE PLACE TO WORK. THE UNABLE TO GATHER INFORMATION ON GLASS DOOR BECAUSE FORMER EMPLOYEES ARE TERRIFIED OF PUBLICLY SAYING TRUTHFUL THINGS. ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE OF HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION. IN FACT RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE AVAILABILITY OF NON ANONYMOUS INFORMATION ON GLASSDOOR ACTUALLY INCREASED AFTER SB EIGHT TWENTY. RESTRICTED THE USE OF SECRET SETTLEMENTS I UNDERSTAND THAT OPPONENTS OF SB THREE THREE ONE ARGUE THAT THIS BILL WILL DISCOURAGE EMPLOYERS FROM PAYING SEVERANCE TO WORKERS A SIMILAR ACCUSATION WAS MADE ABOUT SB EIGHT TWENTY IT WAS SAID THAT IF YOU TAKE AWAY THE NDA PARTIES WILL BE ABLE TO SETTLE CASES. AND THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED. WHEN AND THE AGE WERE TAKEN OFF THE TABLE THEY JUST NO LONGER BECAME A PART OF NEGOTIATION. WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT THE TRUE VALUE IN A SEVERANCE AGREEMENT IT'S THE RELEASE PLANE'S NOT SECRECY PROVISION. A RELEASE AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF MONTHS OR YEARS OF LITIGATION. AND THE POTENTIAL OF AN ADVERSE JUDGMENT. FURTHERMORE IT ARGUES THAT THE SECRECY PROVISIONS ARE EFFECTIVELY UNENFORCEABLE NOW IN MY THIRTY YEARS OR MORE OF LAW PRACTICE THE ONLY ENFORCEMENT ACTION I'M AWARE OF. WHAT DONALD TRUMP'S CLAIM AGAINST ARMY DANIELS. NO RATIONAL EMPLOYERS TO SPEND FORCING NON DISPARAGEMENT CLAUSE BECAUSE DOING SO SIMPLY BE PUBLICIZED. THE ALLEGED COMMENTS. THE TRUE VALUE IN THESE PROVISIONS THE AMERICAN CERAMIC BACKED AWAY TWENTY MILLION EMPLOYEES AND THANKS SILENCE EVEN ABOUT UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT. THIS NOT ONLY HURTS WORKERS IN ENDANGERED PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE PUBLIC- AND DOES A DISSERVICE TO LAW ABIDING EMPLOYERS WHO ARE COMPETING. FOR EMPLOYEES AND THE JOB MARKET SO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CUENTA LURKING SUFFICIENT URGE THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE YES ON SB THREE THREE ONE. THANK YOU AND WE ALSO HAVE MISSISSAUGA. THANK YOU- CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY TODAY MY ENTIRE CAREER HAS BEEN ATTACKED PUBLIC POLICY OFFICIAL ENGAGING WITH OFFICES LIKE YOURS ON BEHALF OF COMPANIES LIKE GOOGLE FACEBOOK AND ENSURE AT MY LAST WORK TRIP BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WHAT THE DEFEAT SEPARATE THAT WORK ON HELP WITH THAT I LAGGED ON HELP WITH INFORMATION. THAT WOULD DAYS BEFORE PINTEREST LAWYERS PRESENTED ME WITH A HIGHLY RESTRICTIVE NONDISCLOSURE AND NON DISPARAGEMENT AGREEMENT MEANT THINKING IF I WENT ABOUT THE RACE AND GENDER DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION CLAIM I'D RAISED OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR WHEN I DECIDED TO COMEFORWARD PUBLICLY I ALONG WITH THE FORMER COLLEAGUE NAMED ERICA ISSUED THE BANKS DID SO WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT WOULD BE COVERED FOR DISCLOSURES RELATED TO GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION UNDER ACT BE EIGHT TWENTY. WHICH I'M SO GRATEFUL TO TENER LEYVA FOR OFFERING DURING THE MEETING WITH MATT UNFORTUNATELY AS A BLACK WOMAN I CANNOT SEPARATE MY RATES FROM MY GENDER WHICH MEANT THAT MENTIONS OF THE RACE DISCRIMINATION I AND DEREK COULD RESULT IN LEGAL RETALIATION NO WORKERS SHOULD BE IN A POSITION WHERE PART OF THEIR IDENTITY EVELYN COVERED WHEN IT COMES TO DISPOSING UNLAWFUL TREATMENT. AND YEARS LIKE THE ONE I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO SIGN OUR USED BY COMPANIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA DISTRICT WORKERS A FUNDAMENTALLY AMERICAN SPEECH RIGHT HOW MANY WORKERS CAN REFUSE TO SIGN THESE AGREEMENTS AT THE EXTENT THAT THE INCOME OR HEALTH INSURANCE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. WHAT'S WORSE IS THAT COMPANIES DON'T EVEN NEED TO AND YET THE KEY PROPRIETARY INFORMATION SAY THAT INFO IS ALREADY PROTECTED USING IT THE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT EMPLOYEES MUST SIGN WHEN THEY'RE HIRED ADDITIONALLY AS PETER MENTIONED LISA CLOSETS AND SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS ENSURE COMPANIES DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LITIGATION FROM OUTGOING EMPLOYEES. FINALLY THIS BILL WOULD ALSO BENEFIT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY BY INCREASING TRANSPARENCY FOR SHAREHOLDERS I'M. NOT THE INDIVIDUAL SPEAK UP AND THAT'S- CAPTAIN OF ABOUT MISSED AT THE- PLAN WHICH THEY HAVE A- STAKE. WE SHOULD ARGUE AGAIN THAT. LET IT PLAY. A LOT ABOUT THOSE AND I. THAT ABOUT THE BILL STYLE. SB THIRTY ONE AND THIS GUY. HER AND ASSAULT BUT MY HOPE IS THAT IT WILL ON BALLOT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU IN WHICH WOULD YOUR FOR A PLEASE.

I HAD TODAY I'D LIKE TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS ONE REQUESTED AMENDMENTS- IN THE SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WE HAD DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR- IN THE COMMITTEE ABOUT THE SCOPE OF THE BILL AND THAT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS RECOGNIZED THAT THERE WAS A CONCERN THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL COULD BE INTERPRETED MEAN THAT EMPLOYEES COULD NOT BE PREVENTED FROM DISCLOSING HOW MUCH MONEY THEY RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF THE SEVERANCE AGREEMENT SO THE AMOUNT TO THE SEVERANCE- THIS IS A CONCERN TO EMPLOYERS- AT THE- COMPARISONS BETWEEN SEVERANCE AMOUNT COULD LEAD TO. POTENTIAL RESENTMENT BETWEEN EMPLOYEES- AND ORGAN SIMPLER FOR ANY DIFFERENCES ULTIMATELY COULD ALSO LEAD TO SOME LEGAL DISPUTES WHICH IS A BIG PART OF WHAT SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS ARE REALLY INTENDED TO POINT OUT THAT ANALYSIS THEREFORE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT WERE EXPECTED TO QUOTE CLARIFIED THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE SEVERANCE PAYMENT MAY BE KEPT CONFIDENTIAL AS PART OF A SEPARATE AGREEMENTS. HOWEVER AND THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE THAT WILL- WITHIN THE AMENDMENT TO SUBSECTION II OF THE RELEVANT- CODES STATE THAT NOTHING PROHIBITS PROHIBITING DISCLOSURE OF THE AMOUNT OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT NOT A SEPARATE AGREEMENT I WHEN WE RACES AFTER COMMITTEE AND WE AUTHORED SPONSORS DECLINED TO ACCEPT THAT AMENDMENT BECAUSE THEY DID NOT BELIEVE THE BILL AT THE TEMPERATE NOW COULD BE READ TO PROHIBIT KEEPING THAT AND THAT CONFIDENTIAL. HOWEVER WE BELIEVE CLARITY IN STATUTORY LANGUAGE ABOUT WHAT ALIVE DOES OR DOES NOT PROHIBIT IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR EMPLOYERS ESPECIALLY THOSE SMALL EMPLOYERS WHO MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO LEGAL COUNSEL- BE ANALYSIS ACTUALLY FROM THIS COMMITTEE AGREED WITH THAT AND I AGREE THAT THE CLARIFICATION WOULD BE BENEFICIAL AND RECOMMENDED THAT THIS AMENDMENT BE CONSIDERED U. S. WAY TREATABLE CONCERNS THAT STATUTES NOT BE READ MORE PROBABLY THAN INTENDED- WE THEREFORE DO REQUESTED. PROTECTION EASY AMENDED TO MAKE CLEAR THAT NOTHING. AND BILL PRESS.

THIS INCREASE IN ABUSE HAS AGAIN HIGHLIGHTED THE CRITICAL NEED. TO ENSURE THAT OUR LAWS ACCURATELY REFLECT AND ADDRESS THE VARIOUS FORMS THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND ABUSE CAN TAKE. LAST YEAR MY COLLEAGUE IN THE JOINT AUTHOR OF THIS BILL SENATOR SUSAN RUBIO EXPANDED THE DEFINITION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TO INCLUDE COERCIVE CONTROL. THOSE OF US WHO HAVE SOME FAMILIARITY WITH THE RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE NOW. THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ISN'T SIMPLY ABOUT ONE PERSON HITTING OR ABUSING ANOTHER IT'S ABOUT A CYCLE OF VIOLENCE AND CONTROL. THAT CAUSES THE VICTIM OR SURVIVOR TO BE IN PERPETUAL FEAR. AND REPRODUCTIVE COERCION IS A KEY FORM OF ABUSE THAT IS PART OF THAT CYCLE. EXPANDING ON THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE FROM LAST YEAR AND BUILDING ON THE WIDE ARRAY OF RESEARCH AROUND REPRODUCTIVE COERCION AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. SB THREE SEVENTY FOUR WOULD CLARIFY THAT REPRODUCTIVE COERCION IS A FORM OF COERCIVE CONTROL. WELL MY WITNESSES WILL PROVIDE A MORE IN DEPTH EXPLANATION WHAT THIS MEANS ON A HIGH LEVEL OF THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE INDICATES REPRODUCTIVE COERCION. WOULD INCLUDE USING FORCE OR THE THREAT OF FORCE TO DO THE FOLLOWING. EXCESSIVELY AND ON RECENTLY PRESSURING SOMEONE TO GET PREGNANT. DELIBERATELY FEAR INTERFERING WITH CONTRACEPTION USE OR ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH INFORMATION. AND USING COERCIVE TACTICS SUCH AS FORCE WITH THREAT OF FORCE TO CONTROL OR TEMP TO CONTROL VARIOUS PREGNANCY OUTCOMES. ALTHOUGH THE TERM REPRODUCTIVE COERCION MAY BE UNFAMILIAR TO MANY OF US THIS ABUSIVE BEHAVIOR IS UNFORTUNATELY ALL TOO COMMON AS PART OF THE CYCLE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. EIGHT TWO THOUSAND STUDY THAT LOOKED AT FIVE FOR A FAMILY PLANNING CLINICS NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. FOUNDED APPROXIMATELY 20% OF DV SURVIVORS AGES SIXTEEN TO TWENTY NINE. HAD EXPERIENCED PREGNANCY COERCION. A TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN STUDY OF FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY SEXUALLY ACTIVE HIGH SCHOOL FEMALES. FOUND THAT NEARLY ONE IN EIGHT HAD EXPERIENCE REPRODUCTIVE COERCION IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS. AND THE NATIONAL HOTLINE INVESTING VIOLENCE FOUND THAT 25% OF WOMEN. HAD REPORTED THAT THEIR PARTNER OR EX PARTNER HAD TRIED TO FORCE OR PRESSURE THEM TO BECOME PREGNANT. REPRODUCTIVE COERCION IS A COMMON FORM OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND YET DESPITE ITS WIDESPREAD IMPACT. IT REMAINS UNNAMED IN CALIFORNIA'S LAWS. I AND THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS THAT IT WOULD PROVIDE ACCESS TO THINGS LIKE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDERS. AND OTHER FORMS OF JUDICIAL RELIEF TO SURVIVORS SEEKING JUSTICE AND PROTECTION FROM OUR DB LOSS. THIS BILL WILL SAVE LIVES. I HAVE WITH ME TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY DAY PROFESSOR JAMES STOVER. WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF UC IRVINE'S DOMESTIC VIOLENCE LAW CLINIC AND THE INITIATIVE TO END FAMILY VIOLENCE. AS WELL AS DR ADAM CROSS HAND. CROSSWIND AND OBGYN TEACHING AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. WHO HAS FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE WITNESSING THIS TYPE OF ABUSE. THANK YOU I DO HAVE THE TWO WITNESSES LISTED PROFESSOR STOVER AND DR CROSSLAND PROFESSOR STOVER. THANK HERE GOOD MORNING TESTIMONY FAMILY MEMBERS MY NAME IS JAMES GALLAGHER AND I GOT PRESENTED TO BE SURVIVORS FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS IN A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE SCHOOL OF LAW. ON BEHALF OF THE UC I LIKE ELECTRIC PILOTS CLINIC IN OUR MANY CLIENTS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED REPRODUCTIVE COERCION. SB THREE SEVENTY FOUR. THIS IS I WOULD REQUIRE BECAUSE WE COERCION NEXT PER. IN HARMFUL AT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WOULD HARM INCLUDING INCREASED TRANSMITTED INFECTION I MEAN CAN THE PREGNANCY AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE INCLUDES HIGH QUALITY FOLLOWING DISCOLORATION. APPOINTED BODY IN TRASH. WE PRACTICAL OCEANS THINK IT'S- PERSON TO ABOUT AND PROJECTION THANK YOU GUYS WRITTEN IN MY AND- IN PART BECAUSE I CAN CERTAINLY. IF HE REMAINED ON HOLD CALIFORNIA'S CONNECTED VIOLENCE. PREVENTION BUT WITH WELL IT'S LARA MEDICAL SOCIAL WE- WHEN APPARENTLY CAN CREATE SIXTY WITH THE NEW THEY FELT WHEN SHE COURAGEOUS ASK THAT I SHARE HER STORY. WE SHOULD TO OUR CLINIC CHIU I BE LOOKING FOR OF THE- FROM HER EX. INCLUDING FOR BACK THAT LEFT HER FOR AND BITTEN. THE TO DATE SHE ALSO COUNTY I SHE WENT BACK HOME YOU CONDOMS I WOULD ARMS WE- BUT HE REFUSED AND TOLD HER JUST PLAIN BE REPORTING PREGNANT. WE SHE BECAME PREGNANT I'M GOING INSISTED THAT SHE HAD BEEN GOING. BUT SHE DIDN'T WANT THE SHOULDN'T THAT. INSTEAD GOT A CRITICS. FOR DIRECT VIOLENCE ORDER. DURING THE RESTRAINING HERE WE ARE TESTIFIED ABOUT THAT WE IRISH. WHAT WE RECOGNIZE AS EVERY COERCION. DETACHED CAN LEVINE. SHE ACROSS CUSTOM. THAT I YOU TALKING ABOUT RIGHT. HI CALIF ON. I CASH BUT IT HAS SO OFTEN. HI EXPERIENCE LIVING I'D MUCH SURVIVE ARE STILL LOCKED D. NIGHT ONLY SAFETY IN HEALTH. AND WHY WOULD CAL PM. SIX FIFTY THREE. EVEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR CROW THE- THANK YOU DOWN COMMITTEE ON THE OF DOCTOR HA AND REPLIED HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ALIKE MY NAME IS DR ADAM CROSSMAN MATERNAL FETAL MEDICINE TELLS SUFFICIENT. REPRODUCTIVE COERCION IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT MY CAREER. WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN A CLINICAL SETTING IS WOMEN ASKING FOR BIRTH CONTROL METHODS THEIR PARTNERS CAN'T SEE OR KNOW ABOUT. THE ASK FOR THE DEPO-PROVERA SHOT A MEDICATION THAT IS INJECTED ONCE EVERY THREE MONTHS SO THAT THEIR PARENTS HAT THEIR PARTNERS CAN'T THROW AWAY THEIR BIRTH CONTROL PILLS OR POKE HOLES IN CONDOMS. THE SPECIFICALLY ASK FOR THE HORMONE FREE INTRAUTERINE DEVICE TO GIVE SOME HEAVIER MORE PAINFUL PERIODS DESPITE HAVING MULTIPLE OF LESS PAINFUL CHOICES. BECAUSE THEY STILL NEED TO HAVE A PERIOD OTHERWISE THEIR PARTNER MIGHT SUSPECT THE DEER USING A CONTRACEPTIVE AND HURT OR PIZZA. YZERMAN WOMEN WHO GET TESTED MORE FREQUENTLY FOR SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS. BECAUSE OF THEIR PARTNERS HAVING MULTIPLE OTHER PARTNERS AND REFUSING TO WEAR A CONDOM. ON DAYS WHEN WE PERFORM ABORTIONS THIS LOOKS LIKE PATIENTS WHO UNDERGO THE PROCEDURE WITHOUT PAIN MEDICATION. IF YOU WANT PAIN MEDICATION YOU NEED A DRIVER TO DRIVE YOU HOME OUT OF FEAR THESE PATIENTS HAVE NO FRIENDS OR FAMILY TO CALL THEY ALSO CAN'T APPEAR SLEEPY OR ALTERED FROM MEDICATION WHEN THEIR PARTNERS COME HOME FOR FEAR OF AROUSING SUSPICION. WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE ON LABOR AND DELIVERY OUR PATIENTS WHO WANT TO STAY PREGNANT AND THEIR PARTNERS OR FAMILY MEMBERS WANT TO TERMINATE. I HAD A PATIENT COME IN THIS PAST WEEK WHOSE PARTNER AND FAMILY MEMBER HAD BEATEN HER PREGNANT ABDOMEN. TRYING TO INDUCE A MISCARRIAGE IT DIDN'T WORK IT RARELY WORKS BUT THIS DIDN'T STOP IT FROM HAPPENING. THIS IS WHAT REPRODUCTIVE COERCION LOOKS LIKE ON A DAILY BASIS AS AN OBGYN AND I GUARANTEE YOU THAT I ONLY SEE THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG. THIS NEEDS TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR WHAT IT IS AN INCREDIBLY POWERFUL FORM OF CONTROL AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND OPERATING MAKE CLOSE ALLY ANSWERING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS. MISCONDUCTS I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE GONNA SUPPORT THIS THERE'S JUST ONE LINE IN THE- ANALYSIS THAT I JUST HOPE WE CAN BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC- THREATENING TO LEAVE A PARTNER IF THEY DO NOT BECOME PREGNANT CAN BE A BIT BROAD BECAUSE I THINK AND- ADULT RELATIONSHIPS THE DECISION TO HAVE CHILDREN SOMETIMES DOES OR NOT HAVE CHILDREN AND COULD RESULT IN IN A PARTNER LEAVING ANOTHER PARTNER- AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY OBVIOUSLY I THINK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND REASONABLE THREAT SIR. YOU KNOW FIRST OF IT JUST SEEMS THAT I CAN THAT ONE STATEMENT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION IS LIKE WITH ANY NOW SYSTEM PERMISSION TO RESPOND IT IS NOW SAYS ON PAGE SIX AT THE VERY BOTTOM AND IS IT IN THE LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE- IT WAS IN THE ANALYSIS I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S AN LEGISLATIVE I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT OF THAT COMES IT IT SEEMS A BIT BROAD- TO DEFINE. THAT IS COURSE- JUST ON ITS FACE IF YOU WELL THE STATEMENT ON ITS FACE. THAT'S A GOOD POINT I AGREE WITH THAT AND I BELIEVE AND I CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THIS LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE IN A DETAIL BUT- I. THINK THAT'S NOT REFLECTED IN THE ACTUAL BILL LANGUAGE WHERE THE BILL LANGUAGE DEFINES- COMPELLING AS- THE OTHER COMPELLING OTHER PARTY BY FORCE THREAT OF FORCE OR INTIMIDATION. INCLUDING THREATS BASED ON ACTUAL OR SUSPECTED IMMIGRATION STATUS TO ENGAGE IN CONDUCT FROM WHICH THE OTHER PARTY HAS A RIGHT TO STAINED. OR UNSTAINED FROM CONDUCT IN WHICH THE OTHER PARTY HAS INCORRECT ENGAGED. I REPRODUCTIVE CONCLUSION CONSISTS OF CONTROL OF THE REPRODUCTIVE AUTONOMY OF ANOTHER THROUGH FOR SORT OF FORCE OR INTIMIDATION. AND MAY INCLUDE BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO ON RECENTLY PRESSURING OTHER PARTY TO BECOME PREGNANT. DELIBERATELY INTERFERING WITH CONTRACEPTION USE OR ACCESS TO REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH INFORMATION. ARE USING COERCIVE TACTICS TO CONTROL OR TEMP TO CONTROL PREGNANCY OUTCOMES OF- IN AND OUT WE HAVE EXAMPLES OF COURSE OF CONTROL INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO ON RECENTLY ENGAGING IN ANY OF THE FOLLOWING. ISOLATING THE OTHER PARTY FROM FRIENDS RELATIVES OR OTHER PARTY SOURCES OF SUPPORT- DEPRIVING OTHER PARTY BASIC NECESSITIES CONTROLLING REGULATING OR MONITORING THE OTHER PARTIES MOVEMENTS COMMUNICATIONS DAILY BEHAVIOR FINANCES. ECONOMIC RESOURCES OR ACCESS TO SERVICES UP I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF IF WE CAN IDENTIFY ANY LANGUAGE THAT WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC IN THE WAY YOU DESCRIBE IT. I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ISOLATE UNREASONABLE COERCIVE BEHAVIOUR I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THE BILL AGAIN IT WAS JUST THAT STATEMENT NAY NOW SAYS THAT CAUSED ME TO PAUSE A BIT- AND THAT'S- NOT REFLECTED IN THE pBILL SO IT JUST. WANTED TO POINT OUT SOMETIMES PEOPLE READ ANALYSIS AND THINK WHERE. SEEMS A BIT- MAYBE. GETTING INTO PEOPLE'S PERSONAL LIVES A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN A WE SHOULD AND SO I JUST WANT TO WANT TO NOTE THAT GIVEN THAT ANALYSIS THAT THAT JUST SEEMED A BIT BROAD- NOT THE BILL ITSELF THE BILL IS. VERY PRO THEY DO THAT THAT'S A GOOD POINT IN IT AND I THINK WITH THE IN HOUSE IS DOING IS POINTING OUT WITH SOME OF THE- LITERATURE IS SAYING. ABOUT THE SITUATION SO. THE POINT I APPRECIATE. THE CLOSE ATTENTION OF THAT AND- I SINCE I'M NEW TO THE SENATE WILL- ASKING. WITH MY- AND COMMITTEE STAFF TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO ADDRESS THE- THAT. PARTICULAR LOT. YEAH I'M NOT SURE THAT THE BILL ITSELF NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. PERHAPS LEGISLATIVE ANALYST YEAH. I THINK YOU'RE- YOU'RE PROBABLY FIVE. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.
