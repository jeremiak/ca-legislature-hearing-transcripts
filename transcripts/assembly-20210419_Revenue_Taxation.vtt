ELECTION- DID COME ABOUT- IN

01:05:17.246 --> 01:05:18.281

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:22.885
PART. IS TRUE BUT WHAT'S

01:05:22.952 --> 01:05:24.553
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND OR BOOK

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:27.523

WATERCRESS ELECTIONS WHICH

01:05:30.893 --> 01:05:32.628
BASICALLY MEANS THAT.

01:05:32.695 --> 01:05:35.364
CALIFORNIA I'M CORPORATION TAP

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:37.099
THE OPTION TO JUST REPORT ON

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:39.468
SEPARATE FROM THEIR FARM

01:05:39.535 --> 01:05:41.504
EARNINGS EVEN THAT IS PART OF

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:42.505
THE ORIGINAL WATERS AT

01:05:42.571 --> 01:05:45.708
SELECTION. CALIFORNIA CONFORMS

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:48.244
TO FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX LAW

01:05:48.311 --> 01:05:50.780
AND BROUGHT IN A SLICE OF

01:05:50.846 --> 01:05:52.415
SUSPICIOUS FOREIGN EARNINGS

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:54.750
KNOWN AS SUBPART AT. THOSE

01:05:54.817 --> 01:05:56.252
ALWAYS THE CASE. THAT

01:05:56.319 --> 01:06:00.089
CALIFORNIA'S WATER. GRADUAL

01:06:00.156 --> 01:06:02.124
ACTION INCLUDED. ALEXION ARE

01:06:02.191 --> 01:06:03.626
INCLUDED INCOME NOMINALLY

01:06:03.693 --> 01:06:06.262
EARNED ABROAD IN THE CALIFORNIA

01:06:06.329 --> 01:06:08.698
TAXPAYERS. SO ALL THIS BILL

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:11.133
DOES IS SAY THAT THE TAX CUTS

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:13.636
AND JOBS ACT RECOGNIZED THAT

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:15.171
THE OLD REGIME INCLUDING SUB

01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:17.073
PAR THAT WAS NOT WORKING VERY

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:18.974
WELL IN TERMS OF COMBATING

01:06:19.041 --> 01:06:21.110

NEW CATEGORY OF INCOME DEEMED

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:26.215
SUSPICIOUS AND LIKELY SHIFTED

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:28.417
OUT OF THE DOMESTIC TAX BASE

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:29.919
AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:06:29.985 --> 01:06:32.555
BRINGS THAT. INCOME BACK INTO

01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:34.623
THE DOMESTIC TAX BASE I THOUGHT

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:36.125
ALL CALIFORNIA WOULD DO WOULD

01:06:36.192 --> 01:06:38.294
BE CONFORMED AND TO DO THE VERY

01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:40.863
SAME THING. BECAUSE CALIFORNIA

01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:42.331

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:28.804
HAVE ONE OTHER QUESTION WHICH

01:08:28.871 --> 01:08:30.873
ACTUALLY I THINK. IT HAS MORE

01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:33.642
TO DO WITH BECAUSE- CERTAINLY

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:35.644
WE HAVE WHICH IS SEEMINGLY

01:08:35.711 --> 01:08:38.113
INTRACTABLE AND CATASTROPHIC

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.615
CHALLENGE ON OUR HANDS WE LOOK

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:41.150
AT OUR OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS.

01:08:41.217 --> 01:08:42.785
AND IF WE LOOK AT THE LACK OF

01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:43.953
PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE AS A

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:45.488
STATE MIKE MY QUESTION REALLY

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:47.389
IS HOW MUCH OF THAT IS. A

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:48.724
REVENUE PROBLEM VERSUS HOW MUCH

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.726
OF THAT IS PERFORMANCE PROBLEM

01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:52.628
AN EIGHT YEAR I THINK MONDAY

01:08:52.695 --> 01:08:53.329
OPPOSITION WITNESSES POINTED

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:55.831
TO. THE AUDITORS FAIRLY

01:08:55.898 --> 01:08:58.300
SCATHING AUDIT THAT. A BIG PART

01:08:58.367 --> 01:08:59.468
OF THE ISSUE IS THAT WE JUST

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:00.970
HAVE A TOTAL LACK OF

01:09:01.036 --> 01:09:02.137
COORDINATION AMONGST OUR

01:09:02.204 --> 01:09:03.973

WHAT'S WORKING AND WHAT'S NOT

01:09:10.813 --> 01:09:12.915
AND- I PRETTY WORRIED THAT IN

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:14.583
THE ABSENCE OF FIXING SOME OF

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:17.586
THE STRUCTURAL ISSUES FIRST.

01:09:17.653 --> 01:09:18.921
KIND OF POURING GOOD MONEY

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:21.156
AFTER BAD SO. AND CAN USE I

01:09:21.223 --> 01:09:23.025
GUESS CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT

01:09:23.092 --> 01:09:25.394

CALIFORNIA HAS A HOMELESSNESS

01:11:43.399 --> 01:11:44.600
CRISIS IS. A HUGE

MAKING REFERENCE TO THE STATE

01:11:53.175 --> 01:11:55.644
AUDITOR'S REPORT. SEEING THE

01:11:55.711 --> 01:11:57.046
THRTEEN BILLION. HAS BEEN

01:11:57.112 --> 01:11:58.414
SPENT ON HOMELESSNESS IN

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.883
CALIFORNIA BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND

01:12:00.949 --> 01:12:02.518
EIGHTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:03.719
TWENTY. SPEAKS VOLUMES TO THE

01:12:03.786 --> 01:12:04.920
FACT THAT YOU HAVE TO ASK

01:12:04.987 --> 01:12:07.189
YOURSELF THE QUESTION. IS

01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:09.258
POURING MORE MONEY INTO THIS

01:12:09.324 --> 01:12:12.761
THE ANSWER OR IS THERE A BIGGER

01:12:12.828 --> 01:12:16.699
ISSUE- THAT WE HAVE. AT HAND I

01:12:16.765 --> 01:12:18.734
THINK THE- THE GREATEST

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:19.835
ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT THIS BILL

01:12:19.902 --> 01:12:23.539
DOES AND IS WORTHY OF SUPPORT

01:12:23.605 --> 01:12:25.074
IS THE FACT THAT. YOU'RE

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.309
LOOKING LONG TERM THIS IS YOUR

01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:28.444
LOOKING FOR A SUSTAINABLE

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:31.480
SOURCE OF REVENUE THAT IS GOING

01:12:31.547 --> 01:12:33.816
TO ADDRESS A CRISIS. IN THE

01:12:33.882 --> 01:12:35.818
LONG TERM RATHER THAN HAVING

01:12:35.884 --> 01:12:37.553
DEPEND ON COMING WITH YOUR HAND

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:39.688
OUT EVERY SINGLE YEAR LOOKING

01:12:39.755 --> 01:12:41.223
FOR A ONE TIME ALLOCATION

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:44.026
HOWEVER HAVING ALLOCATED

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:46.028
THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN A

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:48.130
THREE YEAR PERIOD. AND TO STILL

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:49.498
SEE THE KIND OF CRISIS THAT WE

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:52.434
HAVE RIGHT I HEARD THE URGENCY

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:53.535
THAT CAME FROM WITNESSES

01:12:53.602 --> 01:12:55.571
TESTIMONY THAT WE HAVE MORE

01:12:55.637 --> 01:12:56.305
PEOPLE ENTERING INTO

01:12:56.371 --> 01:12:58.207
HOMELESSNESS. ALL RIGHT NOW

01:12:58.273 --> 01:13:00.175
THEN WE THEN WE ARE TAKING OFF

01:13:00.242 --> 01:13:02.745
THE STREETS. AND THE AND SO I

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:04.813
SEE THAT BUT I ALSO SEE WHERE

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:07.282
THERE'S AN OPEN DOOR TO ADDRESS

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:08.317
A CHALLENGE OR PROBLEM THAT WE

01:13:08.383 --> 01:13:10.085
HAVE IN THE STATE. THAT IS A

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:12.688
REVENUE ORIENTED BUT THAT IS

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:14.623
SERVICE ORIENTED AND SO WHEN WE

01:13:14.690 --> 01:13:16.391
START LOOKING AT THAT WE'VE GOT

01:13:16.458 --> 01:13:17.793
TO FIND OUT WHAT SERVICES ARE

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.194
WORKING AND WHAT SERVICES

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:22.765
AREN'T. SO WITH THAT I MEAN THE

01:13:22.831 --> 01:13:25.200
AUDITOR HAD POINTED OUT THAT WE

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:26.502
HAVE FORTY HOMELESSNESS

01:13:26.568 --> 01:13:28.337
PROGRAMS WITH LITTLE

01:13:28.403 --> 01:13:30.439
COORDINATION BETWEEN NINE STATE

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:32.941
AGENCIES. AND WITH BILLIONS

01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:35.177
THAT ARE BEING SPENT. WE HAVE

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:37.146
THE ISSUE OF REALLY A SYSTEM

01:13:37.212 --> 01:13:38.680
THAT HAS BEEN SET UP TO ADDRESS

01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:40.716
HOMELESSNESS. AND IS FAILING

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:42.451
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE MOST IN

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:44.720
NEED I HEARD THE OTHER SIDE THE

01:13:44.787 --> 01:13:46.655
OPPOSITION AND THEIR TESTIMONY

01:13:46.722 --> 01:13:47.890
AND I CAN UNDERSTAND THE

01:13:47.956 --> 01:13:50.025
FRUSTRATION OF WHY THEY FEEL

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:51.193
WHY DO WE NEED MORE MONEY WE'RE

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:53.028
NOT EVEN. BENEFITING FROM WHAT

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:55.297
WE HAVE AND IT'S BECAUSE THE

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:57.566
SYSTEM REALLY ISN'T GETTING THE

01:13:57.633 --> 01:14:02.037
ANSWER INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:03.038
THAT CAN MEET THE NEED. AND SO

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:05.307
WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING

01:14:05.374 --> 01:14:08.710
THE BILL TODAY BUT- WILL. ONLY

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:10.112
MAKE THE WORD BUT I WILL BE

01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:11.580
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY

01:14:11.647 --> 01:14:14.483
HOWEVER. ALONG WITH BEING ABLE

01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:15.918
TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS

01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:17.753
BILL THERE HAS TO BE SOME

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:21.490
EVIDENCE. OF MEANINGFUL REFORM.

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:23.091
OF AND I APPRECIATE THE BILL

01:14:23.158 --> 01:14:25.561
THAT YOU PROPOSED LAST YEAR AND

01:14:25.627 --> 01:14:27.095
I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE

01:14:27.162 --> 01:14:28.397
ADDITIONAL BILL THAT YOU HAVE

01:14:28.463 --> 01:14:30.132
THIS YEAR. I'M NOT SEEING THE

01:14:30.199 --> 01:14:31.867
STRONG REFORM THAT IS NEEDED IN

01:14:31.934 --> 01:14:33.735
THIS BILL. BUT A TIED I KNOW

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:35.771
YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL AND IN

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:37.372
ORDER TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT

01:14:37.439 --> 01:14:38.740
THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD FROM

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:41.610
THIS COMMITTEE- IF THERE HAS TO

01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:42.845
BE SOME EVIDENCE FROM

01:14:42.911 --> 01:14:45.547
ADMINISTRATION- TO SUPPORT

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:48.350
MEANINGFUL REFORM. SO THAT WE

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:50.352
DON'T CONTINUE WHAT WE'VE BEEN

01:14:50.419 --> 01:14:51.453
DOING FOR THE PAST SEVERAL

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:55.023
YEARS. OF THROWING- MASSIVE

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:57.359
AMOUNTS OF RIGHT- OF MANY TAX

01:14:57.426 --> 01:14:59.728
DOLLARS- INTO A SPACE THAT WE

01:14:59.795 --> 01:15:01.396
CAN ACCOUNT FOR AND IT'S

01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:03.398
OBVIOUSLY NOT MEETING THE NEED.

01:15:03.465 --> 01:15:04.466
SO WITH THAT I WILL BE

01:15:04.533 --> 01:15:07.669
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY BUT

01:15:07.736 --> 01:15:08.237
ALSO LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF

01:15:08.303 --> 01:15:11.006
REFORM. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY

AN AREA I'VE HAD SOME

01:15:22.784 --> 01:15:26.288
EXPERIENCE WITH. MY ENTIRE LIFE

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:28.357
I WAS RAISED IN A CHURCH THAT

01:15:28.423 --> 01:15:30.325
CHOSE TO TAKE ON THE ISSUE OF

01:15:30.392 --> 01:15:32.861
HOMELESSNESS AS THEIR MAIN

01:15:32.928 --> 01:15:35.264
MISSION- WE ACTUALLY WENT SO

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:36.765
FAR AS TO HOUSING PEOPLE IN THE

01:15:36.832 --> 01:15:38.300
CHURCH AT ONE POINT WHEN THE

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:41.270
CITY REFUSED. TO MAKE PROPER

01:15:41.336 --> 01:15:44.640
ACCOMMODATIONS. AND I'VE SPENT

01:15:44.706 --> 01:15:46.308
A GOOD BOOK OF THE TEN YEARS

01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:47.075
I'VE BEEN HERE IN THE STATE

01:15:47.142 --> 01:15:48.677
LEGISLATURE WORKING ON ALMOST

01:15:48.744 --> 01:15:50.812
THIS IN MY AREA WHICH WHICH IS

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:52.915
GRANTED A RURAL COMMUNITY VERY

01:15:52.981 --> 01:15:57.486
UNLIKE. YOUR WHOLE. AND THE

01:15:57.552 --> 01:15:58.253

JUST SO BONTA CLEAR THAT. THE

01:16:03.425 --> 01:16:03.992
ISSUES RAISED FROM MY

01:16:04.059 --> 01:16:06.862
COLLEAGUES HERE. ON ON PROCESS

01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:08.297
AND BUREAUCRACY AND

01:16:08.363 --> 01:16:12.301
COLLABORATION- ARE SO VERY TRUE

01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:15.237
AND FROM. THIS RURAL

01:16:15.304 --> 01:16:16.972
LEGISLATORS POINT OF VIEW WHAT

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:18.907
I SEE AGAIN AND AGAIN IS

01:16:18.974 --> 01:16:21.777
LEGISLATORS FROM LA. WHO WOULD

01:16:21.843 --> 01:16:24.913
JUST AS SOON. SPEND AS MUCH

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:26.348
MONEY AS THEY CAN AND THERE'S

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:27.883
NEVER ENOUGH AND WE ALWAYS NEED

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:29.217
TO RAISE MORE AND THERE'S

01:16:29.284 --> 01:16:30.085
ALWAYS SOMEONE ELSE WE NEED TO

01:16:30.152 --> 01:16:32.821
TAX AND YET I GOT UNDERWAY IN

01:16:32.888 --> 01:16:34.456
SKID ROW JUST GOES ON AS FAR AS

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:36.458
THE EYE CAN SEE. THANK MORE

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:37.693
MONEY WE SPEND THE LONGER THE

01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:42.698
BLOCKS GET. AND IT SEEMS TO BE

01:16:42.764 --> 01:16:43.832
FROM AN OUTSIDER'S PERSPECTIVE

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:45.367
A REFLECTION OF THE FACT THAT

01:16:45.434 --> 01:16:47.102
URBAN LEGISLATORS ARE SO OFTEN

01:16:47.169 --> 01:16:49.972
SO DEEPLY INVESTED IN THE

01:16:50.038 --> 01:16:51.840
SPECIAL INTERESTS WHETHER IT BE

01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:55.711
THE UNIONS OR THE- NRDC OR THAT

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:57.813
WHAT WHATEVER CONSTITUENCY

01:16:57.879 --> 01:16:59.614
PROGRESSIVE AWAY LEGISLATORS

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:01.116
FEEL LIKE THEY CAN'T TAKE ON.

01:17:01.183 --> 01:17:02.451
THEY CAN'T MAKE ANY PROGRESS

01:17:02.517 --> 01:17:03.986
AGAINST THE NAME DAYS THEY

01:17:04.052 --> 01:17:05.487
CAN'T BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:06.955
FOR LESS THAN WHAT IT COST TO

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:10.158
BUILD A MANSION WHERE I LIVE-

01:17:10.225 --> 01:17:11.994
ANY GETS PULLED AND I GUESS

01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:13.228
WHAT I SEE HERE IN THE MIDST

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.197
OF. ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY IN THE

01:17:15.263 --> 01:17:16.732
COVERT CRISIS AND SO MANY

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:18.000
CHALLENGING ISSUES BUT I KNOW

01:17:18.066 --> 01:17:18.967
WE'RE ALL FACING AND OR OR

01:17:19.034 --> 01:17:21.136
COMMUTER FACING. I THINK WHO IN

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:23.171
THEIR RIGHT MIND. WOULD SAY NOW

01:17:23.238 --> 01:17:25.107
IS THE TIME FOR ANY KIND OF TAX

01:17:25.173 --> 01:17:27.576
INCREASE ON ANYBODY. RIGHT IT

01:17:27.642 --> 01:17:28.810
AND WE'RE SPENT THIRTEEN

01:17:28.877 --> 01:17:29.878
BILLION DOLLARS I THINK I

01:17:29.945 --> 01:17:33.682
HEARD. FROM MY COLLEAGUE- AND

01:17:33.749 --> 01:17:35.450
SO IT'S I GUESS IT'S JUST KIND

01:17:35.517 --> 01:17:36.084
OF A HEAD SCRATCHING MOMENT FOR

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:40.022
ME. I APPLAUD YOU FOR TAKE ON

01:17:40.088 --> 01:17:40.655
ISSUES I THINK WE ALL RECOGNIZE

01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:42.824
IS IMPORTANT. I THINK I

01:17:42.891 --> 01:17:44.526
VEHEMENTLY DISAGREE WITH YOU ON

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:46.395
PERHAPS THE APPROACH AND I

01:17:46.461 --> 01:17:49.197
THINK WE NEED TO REALLY DOUBLE

01:17:49.264 --> 01:17:51.867
OUR EFFORTS IN. CREATE YOU KNOW

01:17:51.933 --> 01:17:55.037
STREAMLINING THE PROCESS WHERE

01:17:55.103 --> 01:17:56.805
REVENUE GOES TO IT GOES TO AND

01:17:56.872 --> 01:17:59.007
HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER BETWEEN

01:17:59.074 --> 01:18:02.444
THE COUNTIES THE COCS- THESE

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:03.578
THESE ORGANIZATIONS DON'T WORK

01:18:03.645 --> 01:18:05.080
TOGETHER WE SPENT QUITE A BIT

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:06.348
OF MONEY ON HOMELESSNESS AND

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:08.083
WHAT I'VE DONE IN MY HOME TOWN.

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:10.018
IS ACTUALLY PULLED EVERY CITY

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:16.291
AND THE COUNTY. COLLABORATIVELY

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:17.993
POTENTIALLY MAKING THAT MONEY

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.828
GO AND STRETCH A LOT FURTHER

01:18:19.895 --> 01:18:21.496
AND SO I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA

01:18:21.563 --> 01:18:23.198
BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE DAY THIS

01:18:23.265 --> 01:18:24.800

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:34.910
INACCURATE- BUT I WOULD HOPE.

01:18:34.976 --> 01:18:35.977
THAT IF THIS BILL MOVES

01:18:36.044 --> 01:18:38.713
FORWARD- IF YOU COULD DO

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:41.516

DO CLIMATE CHANGE. POLICIES WE

01:19:04.706 --> 01:19:07.409
CAN'T SOLVE PROBLEMS- AND THEY

01:19:07.476 --> 01:19:08.510
JUST GET WORSE AND WORSE AND

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:11.213

REALLY THOUGHT- BECAUSE AS

01:26:14.602 --> 01:26:15.603
BROADLY AND AS IS

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:18.473
PHILOSOPHICALLY. AS I COULD

01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:21.142
ABOUT. HOW WE TAX IN IN WHAT WE

01:26:21.209 --> 01:26:23.945
TAX WHEN HE FIRST PRESENTED

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:24.846
THIS TO ME IN THERE BUT A LOT

01:26:24.913 --> 01:26:26.781
OF TALK ABOUT. ITS CONFORMITY

01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:29.183
ALWAYS GOOD. IS NOW A RIGHT

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:31.786
TIME TO RAISE TAXES. AND THIS

01:26:31.853 --> 01:26:34.255
IS JUST THE WEIRDEST OF TIMES.

01:26:34.322 --> 01:26:38.359
AND IT'S A IT'S A REALLY-

01:26:38.426 --> 01:26:40.962
AWKWARD TIME. IF YOU THINK

01:26:41.029 --> 01:26:43.865
ABOUT ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES SO

01:26:43.932 --> 01:26:46.935
WE HAVE THIS EXTRAORDINARY-

01:26:47.001 --> 01:26:48.703
EVENT OCCURRING WHERE WE DON'T

01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:49.871
KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO SHAKE

01:26:49.938 --> 01:26:51.839
OUT AND AFFECT PEOPLE- YOU KNOW

01:26:51.906 --> 01:26:53.107
I THINK TWELVE MONTHS AGO WE

01:26:53.174 --> 01:26:54.042
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING TO

01:26:54.108 --> 01:26:55.310
HAPPEN WE PASSED A BUDGET THAT

01:26:55.376 --> 01:26:56.277
WE THOUGHT THIS GUY WAS GOING

01:26:56.344 --> 01:26:58.546
TO FALL- BUT IN FACT. WHAT WE

01:26:58.613 --> 01:27:00.515
SAW WAS THAT THE VERY

01:27:00.582 --> 01:27:01.783
WEALTHIEST AND MOST AFFLUENT

01:27:01.849 --> 01:27:04.652
DID EXTRAORDINARILY WELL- THE

01:27:04.719 --> 01:27:08.723
ECONOMY DID NOT CRATER EXCEPT

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:10.258
IF YOU ARE THE WORKING POOR.

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:11.793
THAT THEY THEY WERE THE ONES

01:27:11.859 --> 01:27:14.529
WHO WERE HURT- THE WORST- AND

01:27:14.596 --> 01:27:16.931
THE MOST. AND SO IF WE'RE

01:27:16.998 --> 01:27:19.634
LOOKING AT CONFORMITY ON.

01:27:19.701 --> 01:27:22.236
CORPORATIONS HIDING MILLIONS OF

01:27:22.303 --> 01:27:24.339
DOLLARS PROFITABLE CORPORATIONS

01:27:24.405 --> 01:27:26.240
HIDING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:27:26.307 --> 01:27:29.811
OVERSEAS. THIS IS THIS IS NOT A

01:27:29.877 --> 01:27:31.379
CAST OF CHARACTERS THAT I'M

01:27:31.446 --> 01:27:33.348
FEELING. GUILTY ABOUT RAISING

01:27:33.414 --> 01:27:37.418
TAXES ON NO PUN INTENDED AND-

01:27:37.485 --> 01:27:38.486
AND IN IT AND IT STRIKES ME

01:27:38.553 --> 01:27:40.655
THAT GUILTY WAS A BIPARTISAN

01:27:40.722 --> 01:27:44.192
COMPROMISE IN WASHINGTON- LED

01:27:44.258 --> 01:27:46.361
BY REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT THAT

01:27:46.427 --> 01:27:48.429
CHAMPIONED YOU KNOW BIG

01:27:48.496 --> 01:27:50.999
BUSINESS AND- AND THOUGHT IT

01:27:51.065 --> 01:27:52.767
WAS APPROPRIATE TO RAISES TAXES

01:27:52.834 --> 01:27:56.137
SO- I DON'T FIND IT

01:27:56.204 --> 01:27:57.372
INAPPROPRIATE FOR CALIFORNIA.

01:27:57.438 --> 01:28:00.008
TO DO THE SAME THING. I THINK

01:28:00.074 --> 01:28:01.175
IT IS INTERESTING THAT WE HAVE

01:28:01.242 --> 01:28:03.544
NEVER HAD MORE REVENUE THAN WE

01:28:03.611 --> 01:28:05.546
DO RIGHT NOW- AND THAT IS

01:28:05.613 --> 01:28:07.548
BECAUSE WELL OUR TAX SYSTEM IN

01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:10.151
CALIFORNIA IS INCREDIBLY FLAWED

01:28:10.218 --> 01:28:10.818
PARTICULARLY IN TRULY BAD

01:28:10.885 --> 01:28:14.389
TIMES. THIS TRULY BAD TIME WE

01:28:14.455 --> 01:28:16.791
TAX THE RIGHT PEOPLE WE TAX THE

01:28:16.858 --> 01:28:18.960
ONES WHO DID THE BEST WITH THE

01:28:19.027 --> 01:28:19.594
STOCK MARKET THAT HAS

01:28:19.661 --> 01:28:22.397
SKYROCKETED- AND CORPORATIONS

01:28:22.463 --> 01:28:23.831
THAT HAVE DONE VERY WELL

01:28:23.898 --> 01:28:26.234
CALIFORNIA DOES WELL AND SO

01:28:26.300 --> 01:28:27.969
WHEN I LOOKED AT WHAT WOULD WE

01:28:28.036 --> 01:28:30.772
DO IF WE RAISED THE GUILTY TAX.

01:28:30.838 --> 01:28:33.207
THAT DIED THAT WHAT COULD WE DO

01:28:33.274 --> 01:28:34.676
FOR CALIFORNIANS IN ONE PLACE

01:28:34.742 --> 01:28:36.344
WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:39.247
DID RAISE TAXES WAS ON- THE

01:28:39.313 --> 01:28:39.981
DEDUCTION FOR STATE AND LOCAL

01:28:40.048 --> 01:28:42.650
TAXES AND WOULD IT WOULD BE

01:28:42.717 --> 01:28:44.819
GREAT TO BE ABLE TO RAISE

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:46.821
TAXES. ON ON THE CORPORATIONS

01:28:46.888 --> 01:28:48.423
THAT DID THE BEST AND THEN

01:28:48.489 --> 01:28:50.858
OFFSET THOSE WHO HAD OF A BIRD

01:28:50.925 --> 01:28:53.461
HIGHER BURDEN PLACED ON THEM-

01:28:53.528 --> 01:28:55.329
BUT YOU FOUND A MORE IMPORTANT

01:28:55.396 --> 01:28:57.165
THING TO SPEND THAT MONEY ON.

01:28:57.231 --> 01:28:59.167
SO YOU HOMELESSNESS IS A HIGHER

01:28:59.233 --> 01:29:01.469
ORDER NEED. AND THAT'S NOT

01:29:01.536 --> 01:29:02.704
SAYING THAT WE'RE NOT SPENDING

01:29:02.770 --> 01:29:04.238
MONEY ON THAT BUT IF WE DIDN'T

01:29:04.305 --> 01:29:05.540
SPEND MONEY ON THAT WHAT WITH

01:29:05.606 --> 01:29:07.642
THE MASS BE. IN OUR STATE. AND

01:29:07.709 --> 01:29:09.010
THEY'RE THEY'RE ALL

01:29:09.077 --> 01:29:10.745
CALIFORNIANS THEY'RE NOT.

01:29:10.812 --> 01:29:12.580
ANGELENOS STATE THEY'RE NOT

01:29:12.647 --> 01:29:14.048
PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THE STICKS

01:29:14.115 --> 01:29:16.284
SIR SKID ROW OR THE CENTRAL

01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:17.819
VALLEY OR THE COAST FOR ALL

01:29:17.885 --> 01:29:19.187
CALIFORNIANS WE NEED TO CARE

01:29:19.253 --> 01:29:20.855
ABOUT EVERYONE. IS THERE'S NO

01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:23.157
TRIBALISM HERE. AND IF THERE IS

01:29:23.224 --> 01:29:26.360
IT'S WRONG. THE AND SO WHEN

01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:28.629
WE'RE LOOKING AT. WHAT'S THE

01:29:28.696 --> 01:29:30.164
TIPPING POINT IN CALIFORNIA IS

01:29:30.231 --> 01:29:32.300
IT HIGHER TAXES DID WE RAISE

01:29:32.366 --> 01:29:34.435
THEM TOO HIGH. OR IS THE

01:29:34.502 --> 01:29:36.704
QUALITY OF LIFE SO BAD THAT WE

01:29:36.771 --> 01:29:37.271
ARE FREE TO STEP OUTSIDE OUR

01:29:37.338 --> 01:29:40.675
DOOR. THAT'S THE TIPPING POINT.

01:29:40.742 --> 01:29:42.110
CORPORATIONS AREN'T FLEEING

01:29:42.176 --> 01:29:43.377
CALIFORNIA THERE IS NO MASS

01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:46.047
EXODUS. IS THE WORKING POOR WHO

01:29:46.114 --> 01:29:47.782
ARE TRYING TO FIND A WAY OUT.

01:29:47.849 --> 01:29:49.317
AS THE MAYBE THE MIDDLE CLASS

01:29:49.383 --> 01:29:51.085
THAT'S SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT.

01:29:51.152 --> 01:29:52.587
MAYBE WE'RE NOT CARING FOR

01:29:52.653 --> 01:29:54.422
PEOPLE ENOUGH IN CALIFORNIA AND

01:29:54.489 --> 01:29:55.890
THIS IS IN A PLACE THAT I WANT

01:29:55.957 --> 01:29:58.559
TO RAISE MY FAMILY. ANY LONGER.

01:29:58.626 --> 01:29:59.527
OR CAN'T FIND HOUSING THAT'S

01:29:59.594 --> 01:30:02.396
AFFORDABLE. AND SO WHEN WE FREE

01:30:02.463 --> 01:30:06.234
OUR- OUR ITIES OR SMALL TOWNS

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:07.869
BECAUSE THERE ARE HOMELESS

01:30:07.935 --> 01:30:09.103
PEOPLE PEOPLE WHO ARE IN GREAT

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:11.272
NEED. THAT THE SOCIAL SAFETY

01:30:11.339 --> 01:30:14.041
NET IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH. EVEN

01:30:14.108 --> 01:30:16.177
WHILE THE WEALTHIEST HAVE NEVER

01:30:16.244 --> 01:30:17.779
BEEN RICHER. EVEN ALL THE

01:30:17.845 --> 01:30:19.714
CORPORATIONS HAVE NEVER BEEN

01:30:19.781 --> 01:30:22.083
MORE SUCCESSFUL. THAT THERE ARE

01:30:22.150 --> 01:30:25.086
STILL MORE CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE

01:30:25.153 --> 01:30:27.421
HURTING. VISIBLY NOT JUST IN

01:30:27.488 --> 01:30:29.624
HIDING. BUT ACTUALLY IN HIDING

01:30:29.690 --> 01:30:31.993
BUT THAT YOU CAN'T SEE. THAT

01:30:32.059 --> 01:30:33.194
THAT WE KNOW THERE ARE PROBLEMS

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:34.996
IN SOCIETY SO WE NEED TO

01:30:35.062 --> 01:30:36.464
REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS WE NEED TO

01:30:36.531 --> 01:30:37.498
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING THE

01:30:37.565 --> 01:30:39.734
BEST INVESTMENTS THAT IS

01:30:39.801 --> 01:30:42.003
HAPPENING CONTINUALLY. I AM NOT

01:30:48.376 --> 01:30:49.777
WHAT THOSE WILL BE IN THE

01:30:49.844 --> 01:30:50.945
FUTURE BECAUSE OUR HEAD COUNTS

01:30:51.012 --> 01:30:51.746
YOU KNOW I HAVE NOT BEEN THE

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:53.414
SAME SINCE THE PANDEMIC AND WE

01:30:53.481 --> 01:30:55.516
KNOW THAT THE PROBLEM IS.

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:58.252
EXTRAORDINARILY SEVERE. BUT YOU

01:30:58.319 --> 01:30:59.687
KNOW WHAT WHEN I WAS ALSO

01:30:59.754 --> 01:31:00.788
THINKING ABOUT THIS HOUSING

01:31:00.855 --> 01:31:02.256
ALSO IN THE BUSINESS GROUPS

01:31:02.323 --> 01:31:03.624

01:31:05.426 --> 01:31:07.929
STAND UP FOR THEIR MEMBERS. WHO

AGAIN ARE ARE MAKING A PROFIT.

01:31:10.398 --> 01:31:11.566
PROBABLY NEVER BEEN AS GOOD FOR

01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:13.601
THEM AS A IT AS IT EVER HAS

01:31:13.668 --> 01:31:17.839

YOU'RE ALL FOR ALL THE HOUSING

01:31:22.176 --> 01:31:24.212

PAYING FOR IT. THEY'RE ALL FOR

01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:28.082
THE HOUSING BILLS WHEN THERE'S

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:29.917
A BOND ON THE BALLOT WE'RE

01:31:29.984 --> 01:31:30.985
PAYING BACK THAT BOND IS THE

01:31:31.052 --> 01:31:32.820
CROWD OUT. SOCIAL SERVICE

01:31:32.887 --> 01:31:34.488
SPENDING COULD YOU KNOW WE GOT

01:31:34.555 --> 01:31:35.323
TO PAY INTEREST SOMEONE THAT WE

01:31:35.389 --> 01:31:36.624

01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:38.426
THOSE BONDS. THEY'RE ALL FOR IT

01:31:38.492 --> 01:31:39.927
WHEN IT COMES OUT HOUSE OUT

01:31:39.994 --> 01:31:42.630
OTHER SPENDING. IN THE BUDGET.

01:31:42.697 --> 01:31:44.966
THEY'RE NOT FOR IT WHEN THEY'RE

01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:47.368
MEMBERS WHO PAY THEIR SALARIES.

01:31:47.435 --> 01:31:50.805
DON'T WANT. TO BUT THERE

01:31:50.872 --> 01:31:52.740
MEMBERS ARE DOING REALLY WELL

01:31:52.807 --> 01:31:54.775
SO IF YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT

01:31:54.842 --> 01:31:57.144
HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS YOU

01:31:57.211 --> 01:31:58.679

01:32:05.119 --> 01:32:07.121
GONNA SQUEEZE OUT THE SPENDING

01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:08.089
THAT ARE CAN ALSO PROVIDE THE

01:32:08.155 --> 01:32:11.058
SOLUTIONS SO I LOOK FOR TO

01:32:11.125 --> 01:32:13.060
VOTING AYE THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

01:32:13.127 --> 01:32:15.329
WE HAVE DOCTOR CORD AND THEN

01:32:15.396 --> 01:32:20.334
THE VICE CHAIR. YES I'LL JUST-

01:32:20.401 --> 01:32:21.903
DISAGREE WITH THE ASSEMBLY

01:32:21.969 --> 01:32:24.672
MEMBER FOR MERCED- LOOK THIS

01:32:24.739 --> 01:32:26.407
REALLY ISN'T A TAX INCREASE

01:32:26.474 --> 01:32:29.010
THIS ISN'T. THIS IS TRYING TO

01:32:29.076 --> 01:32:30.311
DO THE SAME THING THE FEDERAL

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:32.413
GOVERNMENT DID. WHICH IS TO

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:34.015
TAKE MONIES THAT SHOULDN'T BE

01:32:34.081 --> 01:32:36.350
HIDDEN ABROAD AND MAKE SURE

01:32:36.417 --> 01:32:38.386
THAT THEY ARE. ALLOCATED WHERE

01:32:38.452 --> 01:32:39.620
THEY WORK WHICH IS IN

01:32:39.687 --> 01:32:42.256
CALIFORNIA. SO THAT'S ONE POINT

01:32:42.323 --> 01:32:45.259
THE OTHER POINT IS IT REALLY

01:32:45.326 --> 01:32:47.261
DOES COST. BILLIONS AND

01:32:47.328 --> 01:32:49.764
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO MAKE UP

01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:51.198
FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT

01:32:51.265 --> 01:32:53.634
HASN'T BEEN BUILT. AND FURTHER

01:32:53.701 --> 01:32:54.969
SINCE A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE

01:32:55.036 --> 01:32:56.771
HAVE BEEN ON THE STREET FOR A

01:32:56.837 --> 01:32:59.373
VERY LONG TIME. THEY NEED

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:02.510
SOCIAL SERVICES SUPPORT IT'D

01:33:02.576 --> 01:33:03.311
JUST GET USED TO PAYING RENT

01:33:03.377 --> 01:33:05.613
TEN. YOU KNOW HOW HAVING A HOME

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:07.715
IN TREATING IT WELL. THIS WAS

01:33:07.782 --> 01:33:10.017
NOT DONE. IN THE HOUSING

01:33:10.084 --> 01:33:11.852
PROGRAMS THAT WE SAW IN THE

01:33:11.919 --> 01:33:14.922
FORTIES FIFTIES AND SIXTIES.

01:33:14.989 --> 01:33:16.958
AND THOSE PLACES BECAME

01:33:17.024 --> 01:33:19.660
UNACCEPTABLE- SO WE'RE GOING TO

01:33:19.727 --> 01:33:21.395
NEED BOTH THE HOUSING AND THE

01:33:21.462 --> 01:33:23.230
SUPPORT FOR THE PEOPLE IF WE DO

01:33:23.297 --> 01:33:25.433
THIS WE CAN MAKE A REAL CHANGE

01:33:25.499 --> 01:33:27.468
IN CALIFORNIA. BUT IT ISN'T

01:33:27.535 --> 01:33:29.270
CHEAP AND FRANKLY THREE HUNDRED

01:33:29.337 --> 01:33:30.204
MILLION DOLLARS IS A DROP IN

01:33:30.271 --> 01:33:32.006
THE BUCKET COMPARED TO WHAT WE

01:33:32.073 --> 01:33:34.575
HAVE TO SPEND. I WILL ALSO SAY

01:33:34.642 --> 01:33:35.643
THAT THERE WERE CERTAIN

01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:37.044
CERTAINLY THERE WERE PROBLEMS

01:33:37.111 --> 01:33:38.346
WITH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:33:38.412 --> 01:33:39.547
THAT WAS BUILT IN THE FORTIES

01:33:39.613 --> 01:33:40.548
FIFTIES AND SIXTIES AND

01:33:40.614 --> 01:33:43.084
SEVENTIES HOWEVER. AT LEAST WE

01:33:43.150 --> 01:33:45.820
WERE BUILDING AT AND FRANKLY

01:33:45.886 --> 01:33:47.688
THERE WAS LITTLE TO NO.

01:33:47.755 --> 01:33:49.290
HOMELESSNESS AND CERTAINLY

01:33:49.357 --> 01:33:50.891
EVERYONE COULD HAVE A HOME OVER

01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:52.860
THEIR HEADS. WHEN REAGAN CAME

01:33:52.927 --> 01:33:55.029
IN THE FIRST THING THAT WAS CUT

01:33:55.096 --> 01:33:56.297
TO PAY FOR HIS TAXES WAS

01:33:56.364 --> 01:33:58.099
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IS

01:33:58.165 --> 01:33:59.533
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS NEVER

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:01.736
REAL POPULAR BECAUSE YOU HAVE

01:34:01.802 --> 01:34:03.738
TO PUT IT NEAR SOMEBODY. SO

01:34:03.804 --> 01:34:06.507
ANYWAY WE STOP PAIN WE PROBABLY

01:34:06.574 --> 01:34:08.009
SHOULD IF WE'D CONTINUED WITH

01:34:08.075 --> 01:34:10.878
THE PROGRAMS WE HAD WE PROBABLY

01:34:10.945 --> 01:34:11.379
WANT TO SPEND A TRILLION

01:34:11.445 --> 01:34:13.814
DOLLARS BY NOW. OF WHICH A

01:34:13.881 --> 01:34:14.582
HUNDRED BILLION WOULD HAVE GONE

01:34:14.648 --> 01:34:16.450
TO CALIFORNIA AND THEN MAYBE WE

01:34:16.517 --> 01:34:18.586
WOULDN'T HAVE HOMELESSNESS. SO

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:20.888
THIS IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:23.257
FOR YOU TO PROBLEM. BUT IT'LL

01:34:23.324 --> 01:34:24.558

WEEK. I'VE BEEN THERE I KNOW

01:36:04.492 --> 01:36:06.360
IT. BUT WHAT I'VE SEEN THOUGH

01:36:06.427 --> 01:36:08.262
IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO SHUT

01:36:08.329 --> 01:36:10.131
DOWN AND PEOPLE BLAMING THE SO

01:36:10.197 --> 01:36:12.700
CALLED CORPORATION. THAT'S SO

01:36:12.766 --> 01:36:15.236
COOPER CORPORATION. THE ONE

01:36:15.302 --> 01:36:17.671
THAT IS PAYING FORTY PERCENT.

01:36:17.738 --> 01:36:19.940
47% OF OUR STATE BUDGET. THAT'S

01:36:20.007 --> 01:36:21.408
THEIR INCOME THAT'S COMING IN

01:36:21.475 --> 01:36:22.810
SO THE IDEA TO SAY THAT THEY

01:36:22.877 --> 01:36:26.280
DON'T PAY. THEIR FAIR SHARE. WE

01:36:26.347 --> 01:36:27.915
CAN ALWAYS ASK FOR MORE BUT

01:36:27.982 --> 01:36:29.183
PLEASE DON'T SAY THEY DON'T PAY

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:31.986
THEIR FAIR SHARE. AND SECOND IF

01:36:32.052 --> 01:36:32.820
WE KEEP ON SHUTTING THESE

01:36:32.887 --> 01:36:34.388
BUSINESSES. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:36:34.455 --> 01:36:36.457
MORE JOBS IN CALIFORNIA THE

01:36:36.524 --> 01:36:39.460
HIGH PAYING JOBS. I'M NOT

01:36:39.527 --> 01:36:40.961
TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER JOBS.

01:36:41.028 --> 01:36:42.196
NOT THE TOURISM JOB WHICH IS

01:36:42.263 --> 01:36:44.198
GREAT JOBS BUT THEY'RE NOT HIGH

01:36:44.265 --> 01:36:46.200
PAYING JOBS FOR FAMILY TO

01:36:46.267 --> 01:36:49.603
PROVIDE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. WE

01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:52.039
HAVE SPENT IN CALIFORNIA

01:36:52.106 --> 01:36:54.208
THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. IN

01:36:54.275 --> 01:36:58.746
THE LAST THREE YEARS. I'M SORRY

01:36:58.812 --> 01:37:01.715
IT HAS NOT HELPED AT ALL.

01:37:01.782 --> 01:37:04.051
SOMEBODY PLEASE PROVIDE ME WITH

01:37:04.118 --> 01:37:05.286
INFORMATION HOW THE MONEY WAS

01:37:05.352 --> 01:37:06.954
SPENT I'M MORE THAN WILLING TO

01:37:07.021 --> 01:37:10.357
SUPPORT. TO HELP EASE. THE

01:37:10.424 --> 01:37:13.994
SITUATION. BUT MY CONSTITUENTS

01:37:14.061 --> 01:37:16.664
ARE TELLING ME WELL WHAT DID

01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:17.231
YOU DO WITH YOUR MONEY WHERE

01:37:17.298 --> 01:37:19.667
DID IT GO. IT'S WORSE THAN IT I

01:37:19.733 --> 01:37:21.335
MEAN EVEN IF IT'S WASN'T A

01:37:21.402 --> 01:37:23.571
PANDEMIC IT'S STILL IT'S IT

01:37:23.637 --> 01:37:27.641
ACTUALLY WAS IN IN TWO THOUSAND

01:37:27.708 --> 01:37:28.175
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. IT WAS

01:37:28.242 --> 01:37:29.243
REALLY BAD ALREADY BEFORE THE

01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:32.046
PANDEMIC. OF COURSE IT'S GOTTEN

01:37:32.112 --> 01:37:35.449
WORSE. BUT IT'S NOT HELPING

01:37:35.516 --> 01:37:37.284
WHERE DID ALL THE BILLIONS OF

01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:41.488
DOLLARS HAS GONE AND IS IT JUST.

01:37:41.555 --> 01:37:43.991
ONE WATER INTO A GLASS IT'S

01:37:44.058 --> 01:37:46.227
READY FULL OF PROBLEMS JUST

01:37:46.293 --> 01:37:47.728
THROWING MONEY AWAY IS NOT

01:37:47.795 --> 01:37:50.331
GOING TO WORK AND SO I DID I

01:37:50.397 --> 01:37:53.133
MEAN. YOU KNOW WE CAN'T HAVE

01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:53.968

BUT WE ARE JUST THEY'RE LEAVING

01:38:02.042 --> 01:38:03.911

THEY'RE LEAVING OR NOT THEY'RE

01:38:04.845 --> 01:38:06.680
LEAVING. AND THOSE ARE ALL THE

01:38:06.747 --> 01:38:09.883
MANUFACTURING JOBS THAT PACE

01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:21.642
CONCERNS OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO

JUST SPOKE SHARES OF FIRST OF

01:41:24.445 --> 01:41:26.847
ALL WITH IN REGARDS TO HOMELESS

01:41:26.914 --> 01:41:29.116
WE HAVE SPENT BILLIONS OF

01:41:29.183 --> 01:41:31.318
DOLLARS CHASING AFTER

01:41:31.385 --> 01:41:33.187
DISSOLUTION. AND WE HAVEN'T

01:41:33.253 --> 01:41:35.422
FOUND IT YET I WOULD LIKE US TO

01:41:35.489 --> 01:41:37.558
FIND THE SOLUTION AND ONE OF

01:41:37.624 --> 01:41:38.892
THE PROBLEMS IS BECAUSE THERE'S

01:41:38.959 --> 01:41:40.327
SOME DIFFERENT FACETS OF

01:41:40.394 --> 01:41:42.262
HOMELESS AND YOU CAN PRETTY

01:41:42.329 --> 01:41:42.796
MUCH PUT IN FIVE DIFFERENT

01:41:42.863 --> 01:41:45.065
CATEGORIES. AND SOME OF THEM WE

JUST DON'T HAVE THE POLITICAL

01:41:46.366 --> 01:41:48.168
WILL TO TAKE CARE OF IT- THE

01:41:48.235 --> 01:41:50.204
MENTALLY ILL THE DRUG ABUSE AND

01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:51.738
THOSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE THAT

01:41:51.805 --> 01:41:55.108
CAPACITY. AND UNTIL WE DECIDE

01:41:55.175 --> 01:41:57.244
WHAT WE WANT TO DO ABOUT THAT.

01:41:57.311 --> 01:41:58.345
WE CAN THROW ALL THE BILLIONS

01:41:58.412 --> 01:42:00.347
OF DOLLARS IT ALL OF THE YOU

01:42:00.414 --> 01:42:02.182
KNOW THE VARIOUS AGENCIES THAT

01:42:02.249 --> 01:42:03.450
THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO STEP UP

01:42:03.517 --> 01:42:05.252
AND HELP THESE FOLKS. THEY WANT

01:42:05.319 --> 01:42:08.088
BUT IF. WE HAVE IF WE DON'T IF

01:42:08.155 --> 01:42:08.956
WE DON'T SOLVE THAT WE'RE NOT

01:42:09.022 --> 01:42:10.257
GOING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM BY

01:42:10.324 --> 01:42:12.259
GIVING THEM HOUSES OR OR TRYING

01:42:12.326 --> 01:42:14.261
TO PAY RENT FOR THEM- THEY'RE

01:42:14.328 --> 01:42:15.629
STILL GOING TO BE OUT THERE.

01:42:15.696 --> 01:42:17.064
THE HOMELESS ISSUE IN OUR

01:42:17.130 --> 01:42:19.967
REGION HAS GOTTEN WORSE. AND

01:42:20.033 --> 01:42:22.603
AND IT'S NOT AS VISIBLE- YOU

01:42:22.669 --> 01:42:23.370
KNOW PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS

01:42:23.437 --> 01:42:24.538
GETTING BETTER BUT NOW THEY

01:42:24.605 --> 01:42:25.539
JUST LEARNED HOW TO HIDE

01:42:25.606 --> 01:42:27.841
BETTER. AND SO THAT YOU KNOW I

01:42:27.908 --> 01:42:29.610
JUST DON'T SEE THAT AS BEING A

01:42:29.676 --> 01:42:31.645
GOOD REASON TO RAISE TAXES ON

01:42:31.712 --> 01:42:33.080
SOMEBODY TO PAY FOR SOMETHING

01:42:33.146 --> 01:42:34.548
THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER.

01:42:34.615 --> 01:42:35.849
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MAKE

01:42:35.916 --> 01:42:38.318
IT BETTER OR NOT- I WOULD LIKE

01:42:38.385 --> 01:42:39.887
TO SEE A DIFFERENT. A DIFFERENT

01:42:39.953 --> 01:42:41.255
APPROACH WITH THE WITH THE

01:42:41.321 --> 01:42:43.257
COSTS FOR HOMELESS IS. THIS IS

01:42:43.323 --> 01:42:44.858
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO THIS IS HOW

01:42:44.925 --> 01:42:46.827
MUCH IT WILL COST AND THIS IS

01:42:46.894 --> 01:42:47.427
WHERE WE'RE GOING TO FIND THE

01:42:47.494 --> 01:42:49.363
MONEY TO DO IT. ARE IN THIS

01:42:49.429 --> 01:42:51.265
PARTICULAR SITUATION I HAVE

01:42:51.331 --> 01:42:56.270
GRAVE CONCERNS. ABOUT THE

01:42:56.336 --> 01:42:59.339
RAISING OF AGAIN- IT GOING

01:42:59.406 --> 01:43:01.608
AFTER THOSE CORPORATIONS.

01:43:01.675 --> 01:43:03.043
BECAUSE THERE IS THERE IS SOME

01:43:03.110 --> 01:43:04.478
LOSS THERE IS SOME BLEEDING IN

01:43:04.545 --> 01:43:05.879
CALIFORNIA OF SOME PRETTY BIG

01:43:05.946 --> 01:43:07.948
CORPORATIONS THAT HAVE LEFT BUT

01:43:08.015 --> 01:43:09.449
THE BIGGER QUESTION THERE THE

01:43:09.516 --> 01:43:11.818
BIGGER ISSUE IS WE ALSO WANT

01:43:11.885 --> 01:43:13.320
CORPORATIONS TO COME HERE IT'S

01:43:13.387 --> 01:43:15.422
HARD TO LEAVE IT REALLY IS IT'S

01:43:15.489 --> 01:43:16.957
HARD FOR BUSINESSES SET UP AND

01:43:17.024 --> 01:43:18.625
BE HERE FOR FIFTY YEARS AND

01:43:18.692 --> 01:43:20.527
THEN SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE

01:43:20.594 --> 01:43:21.962
PACKING UP WE'RE LEAVING. BUT

01:43:22.029 --> 01:43:23.697
IT'S NOT REALLY HARD FOR PEOPLE

01:43:23.764 --> 01:43:25.499
THAT ARE CONSIDERING WHERE THEY

01:43:25.566 --> 01:43:26.934
WANT TO GROW THEIR BUSINESS

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.168
WHERE THEY WANT TO EMPLOY

01:43:28.235 --> 01:43:30.270
PEOPLE. TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT

01:43:30.337 --> 01:43:32.172
THAT PLACE IS OFF LIMITS WE

01:43:32.239 --> 01:43:33.640
JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT. AND

01:43:33.707 --> 01:43:34.541
THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF

01:43:34.608 --> 01:43:36.710
BUSINESSES. IN THE ECONOMIC

01:43:36.777 --> 01:43:38.078
DEVELOPMENT WORLD IN A LOT OF

01:43:38.145 --> 01:43:39.947
THE CITIES AROUND. THAT'S A

01:43:40.013 --> 01:43:41.381
WERE COMING ACROSS PEOPLE WHO

01:43:41.448 --> 01:43:43.684
SAY WE ABSOLUTELY ARE NOT GOING

01:43:43.750 --> 01:43:45.552
TO DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA.

01:43:45.619 --> 01:43:47.154
AND THIS IS JUST ONE MORE OF

01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:48.722
THOSE THINGS THAT I FEEL LIKE

01:43:48.789 --> 01:43:52.125
IS CAUSING THAT ENVIRONMENT. SO

01:43:52.192 --> 01:43:54.027
SO EASY YEAH I'M I'M I NEED TO

01:43:54.094 --> 01:43:56.763
OPPOSE THIS- BECAUSE I- YEAH I

01:43:56.830 --> 01:43:58.265
DO RECOGNIZE THAT THE PROBLEM

01:43:58.332 --> 01:43:59.299
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE AND

01:43:59.366 --> 01:44:01.134
I LOVED IT. I HOPE SOMEDAY WE

01:44:01.201 --> 01:44:03.537
CAN FIGURE IT OUT. WE HAVEN'T

01:44:03.604 --> 01:44:05.238
DONE IT IN THE TEN YEARS OR

01:44:05.305 --> 01:44:06.540
THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN

01:44:06.607 --> 01:44:08.442
TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS STUFF-

01:44:08.508 --> 01:44:10.844
BUT- I CAN'T KEEP CHASING

01:44:10.911 --> 01:44:13.580
BUSINESSES OUT HERE. THOSE JOBS

01:44:13.647 --> 01:44:15.882
ARE CRUCIAL TO SOLVING PART OF

01:44:15.949 --> 01:44:17.651
THAT HOMELESS ISSUE. ENOUGH AND

01:44:17.718 --> 01:44:19.186
THAT'S THE PART. WHERE THE

01:44:19.252 --> 01:44:21.355
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK. AND

01:44:21.421 --> 01:44:23.223
WHO CAN BE EMPLOYED AND NOW CAN

01:44:23.290 --> 01:44:26.393
AFFORD TO MAKE A HOUSE. PAYMENT

01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:28.762
CAN ACTUALLY DO THAT. RIGHT NOW

01:44:28.829 --> 01:44:30.163
THEY CAN'T AND IF WE DON'T GET

01:44:30.230 --> 01:44:31.798
MORE JOBS HERE FOR THEM THEY'LL

01:44:31.865 --> 01:44:33.000
NEVER BE ABLE TO DO THAT WILL

01:44:33.066 --> 01:44:33.900
NEVER SOLVE THAT PROBLEM

01:44:33.967 --> 01:44:35.669
EITHER. SO THAT'S WHERE I'M

01:44:35.736 --> 01:44:36.803
KIND OF COMING FROM MONEY I

01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:42.109
APPRECIATE. YOUR EFFORTS. AND

01:44:42.175 --> 01:44:45.212
LOOK FORWARD TO HELPING BE PART

01:44:45.278 --> 01:44:45.812
OF THE SOLUTION IN THE FUTURE

01:44:45.879 --> 01:44:52.252
THANK YOU. I THINK I'M LAST.

01:44:52.319 --> 01:44:52.786
FIRST I WANT TO THINK THE

01:44:52.853 --> 01:44:55.055
AUTHOR I KNOW THAT YOU HAD TO

01:44:55.122 --> 01:44:56.423
HEAR A LOT HERE AND I KNOW THAT

01:44:56.490 --> 01:44:59.793
WE HAVE MAIS MYSELF OUR OUR

01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:02.062
COMMITTEE STAFF AND- AND YOU

01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:03.964
AND YOUR COALITION OF I THINK

01:45:04.031 --> 01:45:06.433
ABOUT EIGHTEEN GROUPS- HAVE

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:07.334
SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING

01:45:07.401 --> 01:45:09.236
ABOUT THIS I THINK THAT WE DID

01:45:09.302 --> 01:45:10.437
OUR BEST TO PREPARE YOU FOR

01:45:10.504 --> 01:45:11.738
WHAT WAS PROBABLY GOING TO BE

01:45:11.805 --> 01:45:13.140
SAID TODAY AND SOME OF THE

01:45:13.206 --> 01:45:14.908
POSITIVES AND CONCERNS THAT

01:45:14.975 --> 01:45:15.809
WE'RE GOING TO BE EXPRESSED

01:45:15.876 --> 01:45:17.811
TODAY. I REALIZE OUR GUEST

01:45:17.878 --> 01:45:19.046
ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO WAS

01:45:19.112 --> 01:45:20.113
FINE WITH THE WAY THE BILL WAS

01:45:20.180 --> 01:45:21.581
BEFORE BUT I THINK THAT YOU SEE

01:45:21.648 --> 01:45:22.816
WHY WE HAVE THE AMENDMENTS WE

01:45:22.883 --> 01:45:26.119
DID FOR CLARIFYING PURPOSES- I

01:45:26.186 --> 01:45:27.287
CAN'T REMEMBER WHO SAID IT BUT

01:45:27.354 --> 01:45:29.356
SOMEONE SAID THAT THE CORPORATE

01:45:29.423 --> 01:45:32.225
TAX ACCOUNTS 440% IT'S 10% OF

01:45:32.292 --> 01:45:34.261
OUR BUDGET BUT- JUST TO MAKE

01:45:34.327 --> 01:45:35.796
SURE THAT WERE DEALING WITH

01:45:35.862 --> 01:45:38.165
ACTUAL FACTS HERE- SO I

01:45:38.231 --> 01:45:39.733
APPRECIATE YOUR WILLINGNESS I

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:40.934
KNOW IT'S BEEN A LOT AND YOU

01:45:41.001 --> 01:45:42.335
HAVE BEEN VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT

01:45:42.402 --> 01:45:43.970
THIS ISSUE I KNOW A LOT OF

01:45:44.037 --> 01:45:44.971
PEOPLE ARE TALKING ABOUT

01:45:45.038 --> 01:45:46.339
COLLABORATION AND THAT THERE'S

01:45:46.406 --> 01:45:47.641
NO CENTRAL HUB AND I KNOW YOU

01:45:47.708 --> 01:45:49.209
HAVE WORKED SO HARD ON THAT. IN

01:45:49.276 --> 01:45:50.844
THE PAST AND THAT IS NOT THIS

01:45:50.911 --> 01:45:52.946
BILL SO I WANT TO CLARIFY A LOT

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:53.547
OF THINGS THAT WE'RE SECOND

01:45:53.613 --> 01:45:55.582
TIER TODAY HAD NOTHING TO DO

01:45:55.649 --> 01:45:56.983
WITH THIS ACTUAL PIECE OF

01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:58.652
LEGISLATION AND IS IN FRONT OF

01:45:58.719 --> 01:46:01.922
US- THAT BEING SAID OBVIOUSLY I

01:46:01.988 --> 01:46:03.890
HAVE THE SAME CONCERNS- THAT

01:46:03.957 --> 01:46:05.525
MANY HAVE EXPRESSED IN THAT IS

01:46:05.592 --> 01:46:06.159
MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S

01:46:06.226 --> 01:46:07.394
ACCOUNTABILITY THAT THERE'S

01:46:07.461 --> 01:46:09.129
MEANS TEST FOR ALL THESE

01:46:09.196 --> 01:46:09.930
PROGRAMS THAT DO GET THESE

01:46:09.996 --> 01:46:12.499
FUNDS- BUT WITH THAT I THINK

01:46:12.566 --> 01:46:13.800
THAT WE'VE COME UP WITH A

01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:16.303
REALLY BALANCED OPTION- TWO

01:46:16.369 --> 01:46:18.038
SEATS TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:46:18.105 --> 01:46:19.673
DOING THEIR BEST AND WHO ARE TO

01:46:19.740 --> 01:46:23.944
HAVE SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS RIGHT.

01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:24.544
NOW FOR GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE

01:46:24.611 --> 01:46:25.512
STREETS. YES LIVING IN URBAN.

01:46:25.579 --> 01:46:27.147
IS VERY DIFFICULT AS A MEMBER

01:46:27.214 --> 01:46:28.915
FROM URBAN COMMUNITY I KNOW HOW

01:46:28.982 --> 01:46:32.052
HARD IT IS- WE HAVE STRUGGLED.

01:46:32.119 --> 01:46:33.620
WE HAVE STRUGGLE TO ALLEVIATE

01:46:33.687 --> 01:46:35.822
THIS PROBLEM AND NO MONEY IS

01:46:35.889 --> 01:46:36.590
NOT GOING TO BE THE ONLY THING

01:46:36.656 --> 01:46:38.658
TO FIX IT. BUT I THINK THIS IS

01:46:38.725 --> 01:46:40.460
ONE SMALL STEP IN THE DIRECTION

01:46:40.527 --> 01:46:41.762
OF MAKING THINGS A LITTLE BIT

01:46:41.828 --> 01:46:43.063
BETTER FOR THOSE YOUNG KIDS

01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:44.064
THAT LIVE ON THE STREET RIGHT

01:46:44.131 --> 01:46:45.332
NOW WHO DON'T GET A SECOND

01:46:45.398 --> 01:46:46.833
CHANCE OF BEING AND KIDS. WITH

01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:49.770
THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE.

01:46:49.836 --> 01:46:51.404
THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR

COALITION THAT IS BEHIND THIS

01:46:58.111 --> 01:47:00.247
BILL- FROM ALL PARTS OF THE

01:47:00.313 --> 01:47:02.616
STATE- YOU KNOW. THIS

01:47:02.682 --> 01:47:05.919

THING IS WE- ALL. CARE ABOUT

01:47:18.799 --> 01:47:21.968
SOLVING THIS CRISIS- ALL OF

01:47:22.035 --> 01:47:24.137
YOU. I COULD HEAR IT. IN YOUR

01:47:24.204 --> 01:47:26.273
COMMENTS HOW PASSIONATE. YOU

01:47:26.339 --> 01:47:28.742
ARE. ABOUT GETTING TO A

01:47:28.809 --> 01:47:31.545
SOLUTION- AND WHETHER YOU'RE

01:47:31.611 --> 01:47:35.415
FROM. A RURAL AREA. URBAN AREA.

01:47:35.482 --> 01:47:36.817
SUBURBAN AREA THE INLAND

01:47:36.883 --> 01:47:39.386
EMPIRE. THE BAY AREA. WE ALL

01:47:39.452 --> 01:47:42.689
CARE IT'S- A PROBLEM. THAT HAS

01:47:42.756 --> 01:47:44.958
UNFORTUNATELY. DEVASTATED ALL

01:47:45.025 --> 01:47:47.093
PARTS OF THE STATE. AND WHILE I

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:48.762
AM PROUD. TO BE AN LA

01:47:48.829 --> 01:47:51.398
LEGISLATOR. RIGHT I KNOW THAT

01:47:51.464 --> 01:47:52.699
THIS IS NOT JUST AN ALLEY

01:47:52.766 --> 01:47:56.102
PROBLEM. AND WHEN I. DEVELOP

01:47:56.169 --> 01:47:58.138
THIS BILL AND LISTEN TO ALL OF

01:47:58.205 --> 01:47:59.973
YOU FOR FEEDBACK AND MADE THE

01:48:00.040 --> 01:48:02.075
AMENDMENTS. BASED ON YOUR

01:48:02.142 --> 01:48:04.678
REQUESTS. IT WAS BECAUSE IT HAS

01:48:04.744 --> 01:48:06.413
TO WORK FOR ALL OF US ACROSS

01:48:06.479 --> 01:48:09.115
THE STATE. RIGHT AND ONE THING.

01:48:09.182 --> 01:48:10.717
THAT HAS BEEN MISSING. IN

01:48:10.784 --> 01:48:12.586
HOMELESSNESS IS AN ON GOING

01:48:12.652 --> 01:48:14.654
FUNDING SOURCE. THAT DOESN'T

01:48:14.721 --> 01:48:17.157
RELY. ON THE FISCAL HEALTH OF

01:48:17.224 --> 01:48:19.793
THE GENERAL FUND. RIGHT BECAUSE

01:48:19.860 --> 01:48:21.061
WHILE WE'RE DOING WELL THIS

01:48:21.127 --> 01:48:22.863
YEAR AND SEVERAL OF YOU

01:48:22.929 --> 01:48:25.165
MENTIONED AND I AGREE. ON THAT

01:48:25.232 --> 01:48:26.800
IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE THAT

01:48:26.867 --> 01:48:28.435
MANY OF YOU HAVE SERVED MUCH

01:48:28.501 --> 01:48:30.203
LONGER THAN I HAVE. IN THE

01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:32.572
LEGISLATURE. AND WHAT WE'RE

01:48:32.639 --> 01:48:36.276
PROPOSING TO DO. IS TO COME. TO

01:48:36.343 --> 01:48:38.545
A FEDERAL TAX. THAT WAS

01:48:38.612 --> 01:48:40.513
IMPLEMENTED. DURING THE TRUMP

01:48:40.580 --> 01:48:43.350
ADMINISTRATION. A REPUBLICAN.

01:48:43.416 --> 01:48:48.688
PRESIDENT CAME UP WITH THIS TAX

01:48:48.755 --> 01:48:49.222
I DON'T INVENTED ARE COLD

01:48:49.289 --> 01:48:51.758
CHINDIT. WE ARE CONFORMING JUST

01:48:51.825 --> 01:48:53.994
LIKE WE DID IN TWENTY NINETEEN

01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:57.864
WHEN WE MOST OF US VOTED FOR AB

01:48:57.931 --> 01:49:00.100
NINETY ONE LED BY OUR CHAIR-

01:49:00.166 --> 01:49:02.636
THAT CONFORMS. IN ORDER TO FIND

01:49:02.702 --> 01:49:04.738
THE KELLY I. T. C. FOR OUR

01:49:04.804 --> 01:49:06.339
NEEDY FAMILIES THAT'S WHAT

01:49:06.406 --> 01:49:09.142
WE'RE DOING TODAY. AND I THINK

01:49:09.209 --> 01:49:12.078
WHILE- I KNOW THERE WAS A LOT

01:49:12.145 --> 01:49:14.180
OF CRITICISM ON THIS REVENUE

01:49:14.247 --> 01:49:16.583
SOURCE- I THINK THE BEST THING

01:49:16.650 --> 01:49:18.318
IS THAT IT DOES NOT RELY ON THE

01:49:18.385 --> 01:49:20.787
GENERAL FUND. TO IT'S SOMETHING

01:49:20.854 --> 01:49:22.188
THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DID

01:49:22.255 --> 01:49:25.525
IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN- AND ALSO

01:49:25.592 --> 01:49:29.129
IT ONLY AFFECTS A SMALL NUMBER

01:49:29.195 --> 01:49:31.131
OF LARGE MULTINATIONAL

01:49:31.197 --> 01:49:33.733
COMPANIES THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:35.802
TO AVOID TAXES BY SHIFTING

01:49:35.869 --> 01:49:39.039
PROFITS OVERSEAS. IT'S VERY

01:49:39.105 --> 01:49:41.241
TARGETED RATE I'M LIKE I SAID I

01:49:41.308 --> 01:49:43.510
DID NOT INVENT THIS OF THIS IS

01:49:43.576 --> 01:49:45.946
SOMETHING THAT WAS PASSED UNDER

01:49:46.012 --> 01:49:48.048
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND

01:49:48.114 --> 01:49:49.849
NOW THIS IS A CHANCE TO CATCH

01:49:49.916 --> 01:49:51.584
UP FOR CALIFORNIA TO COME

01:49:51.651 --> 01:49:54.120
FORWARD TO IT. AND USE THAT

01:49:54.187 --> 01:49:56.690
REVENUE. FOR TO TARGET

01:49:56.756 --> 01:49:58.792
HOMELESSNESS AND I KNOW A LOT

01:49:58.858 --> 01:50:01.294
OF US MENTIONED THAT WE'VE

01:50:01.361 --> 01:50:02.662
SPENT X. AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:50:02.729 --> 01:50:03.663
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON

01:50:03.730 --> 01:50:05.432
HOMELESSNESS AND IT HASN'T

01:50:05.498 --> 01:50:08.401
WORKED. BUT I HAVE VISITED.

01:50:08.468 --> 01:50:10.337
PLACES WHERE IT HAS WORKED

01:50:10.403 --> 01:50:12.138
WHERE PEOPLE ARE BEING HOUSE

01:50:12.205 --> 01:50:13.640
AND WE DON'T SEE THEM BECAUSE

01:50:13.707 --> 01:50:15.308
NOW THEIR HOUSE. THEY'RE

01:50:15.375 --> 01:50:16.609
GETTING THE SERVICES THEY NEED

01:50:16.676 --> 01:50:18.445
RIGHT I'M FORTY THE PROBLEM

01:50:18.511 --> 01:50:20.747
CONTINUES TO GROW AND IT IS

01:50:20.814 --> 01:50:23.817
STILL VISIBLE. RIGHT BUT THAT

01:50:23.883 --> 01:50:26.720
MONEY HAS BEEN USED TO PROVIDE

01:50:26.786 --> 01:50:29.422
SERVICES TO HOUSE PEOPLE TO

01:50:29.489 --> 01:50:31.524
HELP CHILDRENAND FAMILIES THAT

01:50:31.591 --> 01:50:33.526
DID NOT HAVE A STABLE HOME IN

01:50:33.593 --> 01:50:36.563
OUR STATE. WHERE CORPORATIONS

01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:38.631
CONTINUE TO THRIVE AND I

01:50:38.698 --> 01:50:40.066
SUPPORT THAT I SUPPORT GOOD

01:50:40.133 --> 01:50:42.002
JOBS I HAVE SERVED ON THIS

01:50:42.068 --> 01:50:44.537
COMMITTEE- FOR ALMOST THREE

01:50:44.604 --> 01:50:47.107
YEARS AND I HAVE SUPPORTED TAX

01:50:47.173 --> 01:50:49.509
CREDITS THAT BRING JOBS TO ALL

01:50:49.576 --> 01:50:51.811
OF OUR CMMUNITIES. RIGHT BUT

01:50:51.878 --> 01:50:55.448
THIS TAX THIS SPECIFIC TAX. OF

01:50:55.515 --> 01:50:57.884
IT JUST TARGETS A SMALL NUMBER

01:50:57.951 --> 01:50:59.252
IT DOES NOT TARGET SMALL

01:50:59.319 --> 01:51:03.757
BUSINESSES- IF YOU DON'T HAVE

01:51:03.823 --> 01:51:04.858
FOREIGN ASSETS. THAT CORP THOSE

01:51:04.924 --> 01:51:06.893
CORPORATIONS ARE NOT AFFECTED

01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:09.629
RIGHT IT'S VERY TARGETED AND I

01:51:09.696 --> 01:51:12.732
THINK. OF WE LIKE I SAID WE LL

01:51:12.799 --> 01:51:14.334
SHARE THE PASSION FOR
