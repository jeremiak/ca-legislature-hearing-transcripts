ONE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. TODAY IS APRIL EIGHTH. AND I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH. ISSUE NUMBER ONE AFFORDABILITY AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PROPOSALS AND ASKED OUR PANELISTS PLEASE COME UP EVERYTHING. ALL RIGHT I I WOULD ASK THAT WE GO IN THE ORDER LISTED AND I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE. AN ADDITIONAL PERSON. YOUR THE CONSUMER TELL ME YOUR NAME PLEASE [inaudible] CLEAR [inaudible] COST [inaudible] ALL RIGHT [inaudible] KATY REBEL. SEE CAN YOU HEAR ME. THAT'S A NOON THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS APOLOGIES FOR MY BACK. UP FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT PROVIDED A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET THROUGH A COMBINATION OF MARKET REFORMS AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE. SUBSIDIES TO MAKE PREMIUMS AN OUT OF POCKET COSTS MORE AFFORDABLE AND PROGRAMS TO BALANCE RISK BETWEEN PLANTS. SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN CALIFORNIA'S MADE REMARKABLE PROGRESS UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BY REDUCING THE RATE OF THE UNINSURED TO HISTORIC LOWS THROUGH EXPANSION OF MEDICARE AND COVER CALIFORNIA. DESPITE THESE GAINS AFFORDABILITY OF COVERAGE REMAINS A VERY REAL CHALLENGE FOR CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION. RECENT FEDERAL POLICY ACTIONS THREATEN TO TAKE US IN THE WRONG DIRECTION [inaudible] ABSOLUTELY. PURSUANT TO OUR LEGISLATIVE MANDATE COVER CAL BETTER. COVER CALIFORNIA DEVELOPED AND SUBMITTED A SET OF POLICY OPTIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE GOVERNOR AND THE COUNCIL ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. AND IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY FOR LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME CONSUMERS. THE BULK OF THIS WORK I WOULD JUST NOTE WAS DONE AT THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO BEFORE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL BUT WE THINK IT HAS SOME HELPFUL TAKEAWAYS WHICH A HIGHLIGHT TODAY. OF THE OPTIONS THAT WE PRESENTED WERE DEVELOPED THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WITH THE STAKEHOLDER WORK GROUP COMPRISED OF CONSUMER ADVOCATES. PLANS PROVIDERS ASSOCIATIONS AND LEGISLATIVE STAFF. THE MODELING IN THE REPORT WAS PERFORMED BY ECONOMIST DR% WESLEYAN AT UCLA. AND DR NICOLAS TELAMON AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS. THE WORK GROUP CONSIDERED A VARIETY OF OPTIONS BUILDING ON THE TOOLS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT INCLUDING PREMIUM AND COST SHARING SUPPORT. AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WITH A PENALTY AND REINSURANCE. WE PROVIDED OPTIONS UNDER TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES. AN APPROACH ONE WE MODELED ENHANCE PREMIUM AND COST SHARING SUBSIDIES WITHIN LAYERED ON A PENALTY AND FINALLY WE LAYERED ON REINSURANCE. PLEASE OPTIONS WERE DESIGNED TO BUILD ON EACH OTHER TO INCREASE AFFORDABILITY FOR EVERYONE PURCHASING COVERAGE IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET. I WOULD NOTE THAT THE FIRST TWO OPTIONS CAN BE ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE INDEPENDENTLY BUT THE THIRD OPTION REINSURANCE WOULD REQUIRE FEDERAL ENGAGEMENT THROUGH A WAIVER PROCESS. IN APPROACH TO WE DEVELOPED A SERIES OF DISCRETE OPTIONS TARGETED TO SPECIFIC INCOME GROUPS. OUT OF A RECOGNITION THAT POLICYMAKERS WOULD BE TO MAKE TRADE OFFS DUE TO BUDGET CONSTRAINTS. THESE OPTIONS WERE PROJECTED TO COST LESS THAN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IN THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION AND WOULD INCREASE ENROLLMENT BY ABOUT FIFTY TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. OF THE STAFF ANALYSIS THAT YOU HAVE SUMMARIZES THE IMPACT OF SEVERAL OF THE OPTIONS SO I WILL JUST PROVIDE SOME HIGH LEVEL TAKE AWAYS FROM OUR WORK. OF FIRST REINSTATEMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT WHEN PAIRED WITH POLICIES THAT MAKE PLANS MORE AFFORDABLE. IN ADDITION TO GENERATING OFFSETTING REVENUE. AND INDUCES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF NEW ENROLLMENT WHICH CAN IN TURN PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PREMIUM INCREASES. AND IT INDUCES MORE FEDERAL FUNDING BECAUSE THOSE WHO ENROLL WITH INCOME BELOW 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WILL RECEIVE FEDERAL PREMIUM TAX CREDITS IN ADDITION TO NEW STATE SUBSIDIES. BUT AS WE KNOW PREMIUM AND COST SHARING SUBSIDIES MAKE COVERAGE MORE AFFORDABLE AND CREATE SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN ENROLLMENT. THIS IS THAT ADDRESS THE TAX CREDIT CLIFF FOR WHICH WE MODELED SEVERAL. OF THE POINT AT WHICH FEDERAL SUBSIDIES ABRUPTLY AND MEAN THAT PEOPLE ABOVE 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WOULD RECEIVE HELP PAYING FOR THEIR PREMIUMS FOR THE FIRST TIME. THE IMPACT OF THIS POLICIES PARTICULARLY STRIKING FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN HIGH COST REGIONS AND APPROACHING MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY. FOR THOSE UNDER LEVEL BIGGER SUBSIDIES DO MATTER AND GENERATE SIGNIFICANT NEW ENROLLMENT. AS EXPECTED OR MODELING SHOWS THAT PREMIUM SUBSIDIES GENERATE GREATER ENROLLMENT GAINS AND COST SHARING SUBSIDIES BUT COST SHARING SUBSIDIES ARE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO INDUCE CONSUMERS TO ENROLL MORE GENEROUS COVERAGE. WITH THAT HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY I WILL CLOSE WE HOPE THAT THESE OPTIONS HELP INFORM YOUR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS AFFORDABILITY IN CALIFORNIA'S INDIVIDUAL MARKET. WE STAND READY TO WORK WITH YOU IN THE ADMINISTRATION THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] JACOB LAMB. GOOD AFTERNOON JACOB LAMB DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO I THINK THE AGENDA DOES A GOOD JOB OF SUMMARIZING THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL RELATED. TO AFFORDABILITY ON THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET PLACE AND REINSTATE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE SO TO BE BRIEF. THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO BEGIN THE MANDATE AND THE SUBSIDY PROGRAM BEGINNING JANUARY -- ONE TWENTY TWENTY AND WE BELIEVE THAT THESE TWO PROPOSALS WILL WORK IN TANDEM TO INCREASE AFFORDABILITY. INCREASE ACCESS TO COVERAGE KEEP THE UNINSURED RATE LOW. AND SLOW PREMIUM GROWTH -- AND DESIGNING THIS PROPOSAL WE MADE A FEW KEY POLICY DECISIONS -- FIRSTLY OUR MANDATE AND SOLVE THE PROGRAM RELY HEAVILY ON THE FEDERAL FRAMEWORK THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE OUR PROPOSAL LOOKS TO BUILD UPON THE SUCCESS OF THE ACA. AND SO WE MODELED A LOT OF OUR PROPOSALS BASED OFF WHAT'S CURRENTLY IN FEDERAL LAW -- NEXT IN TOWN THE ADMINISTRATION'S THE FUN THE SUBSIDY PROGRAM WITH ANY PENALTY REVENUE GENERATED BY THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE -- BASED ON IRIS TAX YOUR DATA. FOR TWENTY SIXTEEN CALIFORNIANS PAID APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. FOR THE FEDERAL MANDATE -- KIND OF BASED OFF ADDITIONAL RESEARCH WE'VE DONE WITH FTP AND THE DIFFERENCES IN THE FEDERAL -- FILING THRESHOLDS FOR CALIFORNIA. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THESE RUN A PROJECTIONS MAY BE A LITTLE BIT TOO HIGH THE FEDERAL FALLING AT THRESHOLD IS 26% LOWER THAN CALIFORNIA'S SO FEWER CALIFORNIA'S WOULD BE PAYING THE PENALTY UNDER. OUR PROPOSAL. UP. NEXT WITH THIS PROPOSAL WE INTENDED TO BE AN ANNUAL GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION SO THIS WOULD NOT BE AN ENTITLEMENT PROGRAM -- WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE REVENUE ESTIMATES MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR FOR THE THREE YEARS OF THIS PROPOSAL -- WE ARE CURRENTLY ADDRESS LOOKING AT CONCERNS RELATED TO VERY ABILITY IN THE SYSTEM AND HOW THAT MIGHT IMPACT INDIVIDUAL SUBSIDY AMOUNTS. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER OF WAYS WE CAN LOOK AT THIS WEATHER WE'RE LOOKING AT IT IN THE BUDGET YOU'RE ONLY -- FOR LOOKING OUT OVER THE THREE YEAR FORECASTS PERIOD I THINK LOOKING AT THAT THREE YEAR FORECAST PERIOD WILL HELP US INFORMED. WHAT SUBSIDIES ARE ULTIMATELY -- BUILT INTO THE BUDGET ACT THIS YEAR. AND THEN. THERE HAVE BEEN QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR SUBSIDY PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY SO WE'RE PROPOSING TO OFFER SUBSIDIES TO INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY AND SIX ARE PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL LEVEL -- RECEIVE A FEDERAL SUBSIDY HOWEVER THE SUBSIDIES ARE NOT PARTICULARLY GENEROUS. FOR INDIVIDUALS ABOVE 4100% OF THE FPL WE WOULD BE THE FIRST DAY IN THE NATION TO OFFER SUBSIDIES TO THIS INCOME RANGE. OF RELATED TO WHY WERE. OF PROPOSING TO BEGIN THE SUBSIDY THAT TWO HUNDRED PER PERSON 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LIMIT -- IT'S FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR THOSE UNDER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY WHILE. THERE MAY BE CONCERNS AND SPECIFIC INSTANCES ARE RELATIVELY GENEROUS COMPARED TO THOSE ABOVE 210050% THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. BUT ALSO NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT. PROPOSALS TO ADDRESS AFFORDABILITY MORE GENERALLY -- AND HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION OTHER HEALTH PROPOSALS -- ALSO FOR A STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAMMER PROPOSING TO SUB THAT THE PROGRAM BEGINNING DECEMBER. SUNSET THE PROGRAM DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY TWO ALL WERE PROPOSING THE SUNSET PERIOD BECAUSE WERE A KNOWLEDGE JING THAT WITHOUT FURTHER FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP IN ACTION IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS THE BROADER AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES THAT WE CURRENTLY ARE SAYING ON THE MARKET PLACE. AND WE'RE HOPING THAT. WITH THIS SUNSET PERIOD WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RE EVALUATE THE PROGRAM TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ACCOMPLISHING. OUR GOALS OF MAINTAINING AFFORDABILITY ON THE MARKET PLACE. FINALLY OUR PROPOSAL WOULD ALLOW DATA SHARING BETWEEN FTV AND COVERED CALIFORNIA. SO I HAVE TO BE WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL COVER CALIFORNIA WHAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO A PENALTY. AND HOPEFULLY THAT WOULD FACILITATE -- COMMUNICATION TO GET TO LOWER THE UNINSURED RATE FURTHER -- WITHOUT HAVING TO ANSWERING QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU PROP ME [inaudible] THANK YOU. ALEC POLEMIC. THE MAC -- I COVERED FOR BOTH OF US WELL THEN WE'LL JUST CROSS ALEC OUT [inaudible] WELL. BETH CAPELL HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA FIRST TO SAY HOW PLEASED WE ARE TO ONCE AGAIN BE IN THIS ROOM WERE LAST YEAR. THE ASSEMBLY TOOK THE STEP OF COMMITTING A BILLION DOLLARS TO GET CALIFORNIA TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. OF APPRECIATED DOCTOR WOODS LEADERSHIP ON THAT IN THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ASSEMBLY THAT WAS A GOOD SOLID FIRST STEP TOWARD UNIVERSAL COVERAGE WE AGREE WITH YOU. THINK I'M USUALLY AGREE WITH YOU. I CAN'T THAT PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I WAS A LOT OF WORK COME FROM DOCOR WOULD DOCTOR ARAMBULA. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF SPEAKER ANTHONY RENDON ABSOLUTELY AND WE'RE PLEASED TO BE HERE BECAUSE WE COMPLETELY WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH YOU MADAM CHAIR THAT IT WAS THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ASSEMBLY THAT SET THE STAGE FOR THE PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR -- AND WE SHARE THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL OF GETTING TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE AND WE SHARE THE GOAL OF GETTING TO IT. IN THE REASONABLY FORESEEABLE FUTURE -- WE WERE ALSO VERY PLEASED THAT THE ASSEMBLY LANDING CREATED THE AB EIGHTEEN TEN AFFORDABILITY WORKGROUP WITH THE WORK. THE RESULTS THAT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT FROM COVERED CALIFORNIA WHAT THEIR ANALYSIS SHOWS IS THAT IT TAKES A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT TO REALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED TO CUT THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED IN HALF. IN THE INDIVIDUAL MARKET WOULD. REQUIRE SOMETHING ON THE ORDER OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS WE UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S NOT LIKELY TO HAPPEN IN A SINGLE YEAR BUT WE HOPE OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. THE TRUST AS CALIFORNIA MADE A COMMITMENT TO IMPROVE CAL WORKS AND A COMMITMENT MULTI YOUR COMMITMENT TO IMPROVE THE MINIMUM WAGE SIMILARLY WE CAN MAKE A COMMITMENT TO GETTING TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE [inaudible] SPECIFICALLY -- WITH RESPECT TO OF THEM. WE ALSO SUPPORT THE MANDATE PENALTY AND THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT PART OF A BALANCED PACKAGE WE HOWEVER DO NOT THINK THAT THE MANDATE REVENUE. ALONE IS SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF AFFORDABILITY THAT IS NECESSARY ONE OF THE THINGS WE LEARNED IN THE AFFORDABILITY WORK GROUP IS THAT ABOUT A THIRD OF THE PEOPLE WITH INSURANCE AS INDIVIDUALS. SAY THEY HAVE A TROUBLE AFFORDING FOOD AND AFFORDING RANCH AND THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE PREMIUMS AND THEY CAN'T THEY HAVE TROUBLE AFFORDING THE% COPAYS AS WELL. WITH RESPECT TO PEOPLE BELOW HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WE THINK FOLKS IN THAT THOSE INCOME LEVELS. NEED HELP AS WELL WE HAVE CALIFORNIANS WHO MAKE LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND 38% OF POVERTY THAT'S ABOUT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. MOST OF THEM ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE ALL BUT A SMALL NUMBER OF THEM OUR EYES ARE THERE LAWFUL IMMIGRANTS OR P.. PEOPLE MOSTLY WOMEN WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE AND WHO HAVE TO PAY 2% OF THEIR INCOME FOR PREMIUMS WHICH DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A LOT OF MONEY UNLESS YOU'RE TRYING TO LIVE ON FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AND MORE FOR COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES. AND SIMILARLY WHEN PEOPLE HIT THAT HUNDRED AND 38% OF POVERTY THEY GO FROM ZERO PREMIUM MEDI CAL AND ZERO COPAY MEDI CAL TO PAYING 2% OF INCOME. AGAIN THAT'S NOT FOLKS MAKE IT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU'RE NOT MAKING A LOT OF MONEY. THERE'S ANOTHER CLEAR FOOT 2100% OF POVERTY PEOPLE DON'T GET VERY MUCH HELP PAYING FOR COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES THERE ARE. A LOT OF THEM BY WHAT'S CALLED BRONZE COVERAGE WHICH HAS A DEDUCTIBLE. OF ARE YOU READY FOR THIS SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS AND THE ONLY THING YOU GET BEFORE THE DEDUCTIBLE ARE THREE DOCTOR VISITS AT SEVENTY FIVE OR EIGHTY DOLLARS A VISIT. THEY MAKE THAT CHOICE BECAUSE THE PREMIUMS ARE LOWER THAN THE STANDARD COVERAGE WHICH HAS A TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR DEDUCTIBLE. SO WE THINK THE PEOPLE BELOW ALSO THINK THAT PEOPLE LIKE MISS HAAS IS GOING TO SPEAK NEXT. UP COR ABOVE 4100% OF POVERTY NEED HELP AS WELL AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- WE ARE A LITTLE TROUBLED THAT THERE'S A SUNSET ON THE AFFORDABILITY HELP BUT NOT A SUNSET ON THE PENALTY THAT SEEMS ODD TO US. WE UNDERSTAND SUNSETS FOR PRETTY COMMON IN THIS TOWN. FOR NEW PROGRAMS BUT IT DOES SEEM ODD TO US THAT THERE WOULD BE A SUNSET ON ONE PIECE AND NOT THE OTHER SO. WE HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION APPRECIATE -- UNDERSTANDING BETTER THEY'RE THINKING -- AND LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU MADAM CHAIR AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN THE OTHER HOUSE AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE BUDGET PROCESS [inaudible] THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS CLARE HOSP -- I LIVE IN OAKLAND. AND BEFORE THE ACA I KNEW THAT I NEEDED A JOB THEY GAVE ME HEALTH CARE -- I HAVE MITRAL VALVE PROLAPSE WHICH IS A HEART MURMUR THAT DOESN'T CAUSE ME ANY CHALLENGES AT ALL IN MY LIFE -- BUT WAS THE PRE EXISTING CONDITION THAT DENIED INSURANCE TO ME FROM AN INSURANCE COMPANY -- BUT NOW THAT WE HAVE COVERED CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR I LEFT MY JOB AS A NONPROFIT ADMIN -- AND I STARTED MY OWN BUSINESS AND I KNEW THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO GET HEALTH CARE -- MY HUSBAND IS AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR HE GOT A PHD FOUND A JOB TEACHING -- BUT GETS PAID VERY LOW AS L. ADJUNCT TO AND DOES NOT GET ANY BENEFITS -- IF WE WERE NOT MARRIED WE WOULD BOTH QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIES -- INDIVIDUALLY WE A INCOME IS WITHIN THE THRESHOLD THAT WE WOULD GET A SUBSIDY BUT BECAUSE WE'RE MARRIED -- INCOME JUST EXCEEDS THAT SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP AND WE DON'T GET ANY SUBSIDY AT ALL. AND THE GRATES ARE KEEP GOING UP EVERY YEAR -- SO I ENROLLED IN COBRA FROM MY FORMER EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER BECAUSE IT WAS ACTUALLY A BETTER VALUE. AND MY HUSBAND AND ROLE THAN THAT BROWN'S PAYMENT PLAN THAT BETH WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT -- AND TOGETHER WE PAY MORE THAN NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH AND HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS. THAT COMES OUT TO A LITTLE OVER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR -- IT'S ABOUT 15% OF OUR INCOME. AND IT'S FOR PREMIUMS IT'S NOT FOR ACTUAL HEALTH CARE IT'S JUST TO PAY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES -- SO EVERY MONTH WHEN WE HAVE TO PAY OUR BILL WE HAVE THE CONVERSATION AGAIN OF SHOULD WE JUST GET DIVORCED -- BECAUSE THEN WE WOULD GET SOME SUBSIDY AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY SO MUCH FOR HEALTH CARE. WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT GOING WITHOUT. HEALTH INSURANCE AND EVEN IF THERE WAS A PENALTY -- WITHOUT IT BEING MORE FOR AFFORDABLE THAT WOULD. PROBABLY BE BETTER FOR US -- HEALTHCARE IS A GUY IT SHOULD BE QUALITY IT SHOULD BE FREE -- AND IF IT'S NOT FREE AT AT LEAST SHOULD BE VERY AFFORDABLE -- ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS I HAVE ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS THE VARIABLE FUNDING LEVELS FROM YEAR TO YEAR -- AS A SELF EMPLOYED INDIVIDUAL THE THOUGHT THAT I COULD GET A SUBSIDY THAT WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO HELP ME ONE YEAR. AND THAT THEN THE NEXT YEAR IT COULD GO AWAY -- SEEMS LIKE. BOTH REALLY DIFFICULT TO TO MANAGE IN TERMS OF PREDICTABILITY -- BUT IT ALSO SEEMS LIKE A BIG IT WOULD JUST BE VERY HARD TO SUDDENLY NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD IT -- SO I THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND I I REALLY WOULD LIKE IT'S NOT SUNSET AND THREE YEARS I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW THAT I HAVE AFFORDABLE. COVERAGE FOR THE LONG TERM SOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS HAD CHEN FLORI WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY -- I AGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT MS KAPELL SAID REGARDING -- YOU KNOW WHO STILL CAN'T AFFORD HEALTH CARE -- YOU KNOW WE UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ABOVE 4100% THEY HAVE A REAL CLIP FOR THEIR GETTING NO HELP -- BUT IT WILL TAKE CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT FOR HEALTH CARE TO TRULY BECOME AFFORDABLE -- WE DO HAVE CONCERNS AS WESTERN CENTER REINSTATING THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WITHOUT GIVING MORE AFFORDABILITY ASSISTANCE -- IRONICALLY THE PROPOSAL THAT TIES THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE TO THE STATE FILING THRESHOLD DOES ALLEVIATE A LOT OF OUR CONCERNS IN THAT AREA BECAUSE A LOT OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE. SUBJECT TO THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE BUT THEY STILL WOULDN'T HAVE COVERAGE THAT THEY COULD AFFORD SO WE THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER -- YOU KNOW AS LONG AS WE'RE DOING THIS HALL IT'S DO THIS TOGETHER SO THAT -- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT -- MISS CAPELL MENTIONED THERE'S THE GROUP BETWEEN BELOW 138% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY ANYTHING FOR HEALTH CARE AND STILL PAY FOR RENT AND FOOD -- THESE PEOPLE BUT FOR THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE AL -- THEIR QUALIFIED -- THEY'RE LAWFULLY PRESENT IMMIGRANTS WHO JUST DON'T HAPPEN TO BE TECHNICALLY QUALIFIED UNDER THE MEDIC HOW RULES -- AS BETH MENTION THERE'S A SMALL SUBSET OF PEOPLE WHO QUALIFY WHO ARE OVER SIXTY FIVE WHO QUALIFY FOR NEITHER MEDI CAL NOR MEDICARE WHO ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THIS RULE -- AND THEN FOR THOSE GOING JUST ABOVE 138% THE PARTICULARLY IF YOU CONSIDER THAT A LOT OF THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOVING FROM MEDIC HAL INTO INDIVIDUAL MARKET COVERAGE -- IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TYPICALLY GO FROM MEDIC HOWTHE EARNING A LOT OF MONEY AND IN FACT A LOT OF THEM HAVE A LOT OF UNMET NEEDS THAT THEY'VE BEENGOING WITHOUT FOR QUITE SOME TIME. BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN LIVING BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL -- SO. YOU THEY GO FROM BEING A ELIGIBLE FOR FREE CARE TO HAVING MONTHLY PREMIUMS AND OUT OF POCKET COSTS AND IF THEY ENROLL IN THE RIGHT PLAN THEY GET CONSIDERABLY MORE ASSISTANCE BUT MANY OF THEM SEE THAT ONE DOLLAR PREMIUM ON THE BRONZE PLAN THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR AND THEN. THEY FIND THEMSELVES SUBJECT TO VERY HIGH OUT OF POCKET COSTS SO. IT'S A TOUGH CHOICE EITHER WAY AND THEN FINALLY THERE'S THAT OTHER CLIFF -- I THINK WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION IS TALKING ABOUT THERE'S QUITE A LOT OF HELP AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE BELOW 210050% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. PART OF WHAT THEY'RE REFERRING TO IS THE COST SHARING REDUCTIONS BUT THE DIFFERENCE IN WHAT YOU PAY. FOR YOUR SILVER PLAN WHETHER YOU'RE A BETWEEN AT LEVEL OR 210050% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IS NOT A LOT -- PEOPLE WHO ARE AT 210050% OVER IT THEY WOULD ENROLL IN A SILVER SEVENTY PLAN WITH AN ACTUARIAL VALUE OF SEVENTY PEOPLE WHO ENROLL AT 2100% WOULD ENROLL IN A SILVER SEVENTY THREE PLAN WITH AN ACTUARIAL VALUE ON AVERAGE OF THAT DIFFERENCE IN 3% SOMETIMES IT'S JUST FIVE DOLLARS IN A CO PAY -- SO YOU INSTEAD OF PAYING THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR YOUR PRIMARY CARE YOU PAY FORTY DOLLARS FOR PEOPLE AT THESE INCOME LEVELS THAT'S NOT REALLY A SUBSTANTIVE DIFFERENCE AND SO IT'S PEOPLE STARTING AT 2100%. THAT REALLY NEED QUITE A LOT OF EXTRA SYSTEMS -- TO A PREVIOUS STUDY THAT ACTUALLY WAS CITED IN THE AB EIGHTEEN TEN A REPORT OF INDIVIDUAL MARKET ENROLLEES -- TALKING ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO AFFORD THEIR PREMIUMS AN OUT OF POCKET COSTS FOUND THAT PEOPLE EARNING BELOW 210050% REPORTED THE EXACT SAME DIFFICULTY AND AFFORDING PREMIUMS ARE USING THEIR HEALTHCARE. DESPITE ALL OF THIS EXTRA ASSISTANCE BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY HAVE LESS MONEY. ON THE FLIP SIDE WHEN THEY DID THE MODELING FOR THE UPTAKE IF WE GIVE PEOPLE ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE PEOPLE AT THE LOWEST END OF THE INCOME SCALE ARE ALSO THE MOST PRICE SENSITIVE AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENROLL EVEN WITH SMALL AMOUNTS OF ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE. SO -- WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT AFFORDABILITY THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IT IN TOTALITY AND NOT JUST ON WHO'S GETTING HELP AND WHO'S NOT GETTING HELP. BUT IN WHO ACTUALLY NEEDS HELP AND IT'S QUITE A LOT OF CALIFORNIANS AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME OF TIONAL INVESTMENT BEYOND WHAT THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTIES WILL GENERATE. MADAM CHAIR IF I COULD JUST ADD ONE OF THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. IS THE STRUCTURE THAT THEY HAVE PROPOSED TO CREATE WHICH IS THAT YOU WOULD APPROPRIATE ANNUALLY AND THEN COVERED CALIFORNIA. WHICH HAS A HISTORY OF WORKING VERY COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE HEALTH PLANS. AND WITH THE CONSUMER ADVOCATES WOULD THEN DEVELOP WOULD THEN LOOK AT HOW -- TO MAKE THAT AFFORDABILITY MONEY WORK AND SO THAT STRUCTURE OF THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IMPOSES THE PENALTY COVERED CALIFORNIA DESIGNS THE AFFORDABILITY HELP. THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE BEEN DOING EVERY YEAR SINCE GOSH -- TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IT'S AN ANNUAL PROCESS CALLED BENEFIT DESIGN WORK GROUP WE DO WITH SO WE DO WE FIGURE OUT HOW TO DESIGN WHAT THE FEDERAL HELP WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR CONSUMERS. AND THIS WOULD ADD ON THE STATE HELP AND SO THAT BASIC STRUCTURE THAT IS PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S TRAILER BILL MAKES A LOT OF SENSE I THINK TO THE ADVOCACY COMMUNITY. AND IT'S SOMETHING WE THINK COULD WORK WELL WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT AS THEY'RE DOING THAT THEY HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO HELP PEOPLE. BELOW THE LOWEST INCOME THE PEOPLE BELOW 210050% AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE 2100526100%. AND THEIR COURSE FEW OTHER CHANGES WOULD LIKE IN THE TRAILER BILLS WE INDICATED BUT THAT THAT BASIC STRUCTURE WE THINK IT'S VERY SOLID WARY -- APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING THANK YOU. I THINK RYAN. YOUR LAST. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR RYAN WILL SAY THAT. THANK YOU RIGHT. WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- IN EARLY FEBRUARY -- OUR OFFICE RELEASED A REPORT WITH PRELIMINARY COMMENTS ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO IN STATE AN INDIVIDUAL MANDATE FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE. AND TO PROVIDE SUBSIDIES -- THAT THAT REPORT WAS PRESENTED AT A JOINT HEARING THAT THIS COMMITTEE PARTICIPATED IN -- I'M HAPPY TO WALK THROUGH THOSE COMMENTS AT YOUR DIRECTION BUT WANTED TO DEFINITELY HIGHLIGHT -- SOME ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO NOW THAT MORE DETAILS -- HAVE AS HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ARE NOW AVAILABLE ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD ECHO IS -- SOMETHING'S BEEN MENTIONED ALREADY ABOUT HOW VERY CLOSELY TYING THE AMOUNT OF SUBSIDIES TO THE AMOUNT OF PENALTY REVENUES GENERATED COULD RESULT. IN SOME SWINGS IN THE AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE THAT'S AVAILABLE THAT COULD CREATE SOME UNCERTAINTY AND CONFUSION -- FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FOR THE SUBSIDIES. WHEN I AM WE WOULD JUST NOTE HOWEVER THAT-- THE STRUCTURE THAT IT'S BEEN PROPOSES THAT THE PENALTY REVENUES WILL GO INTO THE GENERAL FUND AND THEN THE COST OF THE SUBSIDIES WILL ALSO COME OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND SO FROM A TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE. THERE'S NO REASON WHY YOU HAVE TO TIE THE AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE -- SO CLOSELY TO THE AMOUNT OF PENANCE PENALTY REVENUES SO. THE LEGISLATURE COULD CHOOSE. TO SET THOSE -- SUBSIDY LEVELS THAT MORE CONSISTENT AMOUNT -- AT THAT THAT WOULDN'T HAVE TO CHANGE NECESSARILY TO REFLECT. CHANGES IN PENALTY REVENUES. THE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO NOTE IS THAT -- IT'S BEEN MENTIONED THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS TO MODEL VERY CLOSELY ON THE FEDERAL STRUCTURE -- AS PART OF THAT THE ASSISTANCE WOULD BE PROVIDED IN THE FORM OF TAX CREDITS. THAT IS OF COURSE AND THE WAY THAT THE FEDERAL ADVANCE PREMIUM TAX CREDIT WORKS HOWEVER. IN -- SOME STATES THAT HAVE STATE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE ON THIS ASSISTANCE IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE FEDERAL ADVANCE PREMIUM TAX CREDIT EXCEPT THAT. IT IS NOT ACTUALLY A TAX CREDIT FOR EXAMPLE IN IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. ADDITIONAL STATE ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDED -- DIRECTLY TO INSURANCE COMPANIES UP FRONT MUCH LIKE THE ADVANCE FROM TAX CREDIT WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT THERE IS NO NEED TO RECONCILE THE AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE THAT WAS ADVANCED EARLIER IN THE YEAR. AT TAX FILING TIME. THIS MEANS IS THAT IF A PERSON HAS A SITUATION THAT CHANGES DURING THE YEARS SAY THEY START EARNING MORE OR LESS MONEY THAN THEY DID. WHEN THEY ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED THEIR ASSISTANCE AMOUNT? THEY WOULD PROSPECTIVELY HAVE A DIFFERENT AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE THAT THEY WOULD RECEIVE BUT THERE WOULD BE NO -- ATTEMPT MADE BY THE STATE TO GO BACK AND RECONCILE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ANNUAL INCOME WAS VERY CLOSELY. TIED TO THE AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE RECEIVED -- IN THE CASE OF MASSACHUSETTS IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS DESIGN DECISION WAS MADE. FROM A RECOGNITION THAT IT WOULDN'T BE WORTH IT FOR THAT STATE TO TO DO THE RECONCILIATION THAT WAY. THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO BE THE CASE FOR CALIFORNIA -- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS PREPARING AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST FOR FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO ADMINISTER THIS TAX CREDIT. AND WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD ASK THE ADMINISTRATION TO FURTHER CONSIDER WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPLICATIONS OF PURSUING THIS ASSISTANCE NOT OF THE TAX CREDIT. WE COULD POTENTIALLY SAVE SOME MONEY IN TERMS OF ADMINISTRATIVE COSS BUT ON THE OTHER HAND WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPLICATIONS ON THE AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE IS PROVIDED. AND IN THE LEGISLATURE COULD MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THE CORRECT COURSE OF ACTION ON THAT. VERY GOOD THANK YOU [inaudible] WOULD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR -- JUST -- COUPLE THINGS I LIKE WE'VE OBVIOUSLY BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR QUITE A WHILE NOW -- AND AFTER A SELECT COMMITTEE AND THAN THE BILLS WERE INTRODUCED -- SHORTLY AFTER THAT FEBRUARY I BELIEVE OR MARCH I CAN'T MEMBERS THAT MARCH OF LAST YEAR -- AND SOME OF THE BILL'S MADE IT SOME OF THEM DIDN'T MAKE IT -- AND WE WERE ABLE TO MAKE A A LITTLE BIT OF PROGRESS THIS YEAR I'M CARRYING A BILL AB ONE SEVENTY FOUR WHICH MIRRORS IN SOME SOME RESPECTS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON AFFORDABILITY -- AND WE ARE STILL WORKING WITH THE NUMBERS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE BEST POSSIBLE RANGE BUT IT IS. A SIMILAR TO TO WORK WE HAVE WE HAD ANTICIPATED BASED ON OUR FINDINGS -- OVER A YEAR AGO NOW. SO I AM A COUPLE THINGS I AM I I I I DO -- WOULD AGREE THE SAME TO THE LA -- THAT MAYBE THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER OPTION OTHER THAN A TAX CREDIT -- I DO WONDER IF THERE'S ANOTHER WAY TO DO THAT -- UNLESS I'M MISUNDERSTANDING TAX CREDITS -- YOU DON'T GET THAT CREDIT UNTIL AFTER THE FACT SO YOU'RE PAYING UP FRONT -- AND IF IF I'M MISUNDERSTANDING THAT -- I'D LIKE TO KNOW THAT BUT BUT IT IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AFFORDABILITY IN PEOPLE'S MONTHLY OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES. NOT SURE THAT HELPS IN THE WAY WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT HELP THE SUBSIDY. AS THE OF SOME SORT OF SUBSIDY THAT IS. YEP MORE CONSISTENT OR OVERTIME MIGHT MIGHT BE I THINK A MORE VALUABLE WAY TO DO THAT. BECAUSE I THINK IT ONE OF THOSE CHALLENGES PEOPLE HAVE IS ACTUALLY WRITING THAT CHECK ON A MONTHLY BASIS. SO THEY'RE WAITING FOR A TEMP FEDERAL TAX CREDIT TO COME BACK AND IF I'M MISUNDERSTANDING THIS PLEASE RYAN -- OR SOMEBODY HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHAT THE VISION IS HERE BECAUSE I'M I'M A LITTLE UNCLEAR QUITE FRANKLY -- SUBJECT LAND APARNA FINANCE SO THE TAX CREDITS PROBABLY A BIT OF A MISNOMER WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS ENVISIONING WITH THE PROPOSAL IS THAT. ON BENEFICIARY WOULD ENROLL FOR COVERAGE AND COVER CALIFORNIA DURING OPEN ENROLLMENT GET THEIR SUBSIDY AMOUNT DETERMINED. AND WHAT THAT SUBSIDY AMOUNT IS DETERMINED COVERED CALIFORNIA WOULD BE PAYING THOSE HEALTH PLANS ON A MONTHLY BASIS. TO READ USE THOSE. OKAY PREMIUM COSTS FOR THOSE CONSUMERS -- AT THE END OF THE YEAR WHEN THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE REPORT THEIR ACTUAL INCOMES TO F. THREE B. THEN WE WOULD GO BACK AND RECONCILE TO THE ACTUAL INCOME COMPARED TO THEIR REPORTED INCOME. OF BETH BELL HEALTH IF MANAGER WITH BETH CAPELL HEALTH ACCESS -- SO THE RECONCILIATION OF THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT WHICH IS IN FACT IN INCOME TAX CREDIT -- IS MAKES SOME SENSE TO US BECAUSE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TO GET A LOT OF HELP YOU KNOW THE KIDS IT CAN BE AS MUCH AS A THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH. HOWEVER AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SUGGEST IN THIS CASE FOR MANY PEOPLE IT WILL BE MORE ON THE ORDER OF TWENTY OR THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH. AND SO DEPENDING ON WHETHER WE HAVE THE ADMINISTRATION'S REVENUE PROPOSAL OR SOMETHING CLOSER TO WHAT THE ASSEMBLY CONTEMPLATED BLASTER. BUT WE WE HAVE QUESTIONS WE DON'T THINK TECH RECONCILIATION ON YOUR INCOME TAXES NECESSARILY MAKE SENSE OR IS NECESSARY. AND IT SAID MEN AS LA -- INDICATED ITS ADMINISTRATIVELY BURDENSOME AND AND EXPENSIVE. FOR PEOPLE ARE GETTING A LOT OF HELP WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO TRUE UP BUT WE WOULD ALSO REMIND CHIU THAT MOST PEOPLE USE ABOUT HALF OF THOSE WHO ARE IN COVERED% CALIFORNIA -- THERE FOR LESS THAN A YEAR. AND FOR EVERYONE ELSE THERE'S AN ANNUAL INCOME RE DETERMINATION WHEN THEY RE ENROLL SO THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE COULDN'T DO WHAT MASSACHUSETTS AND VERMONT ACTUALLY BOTH DO WHICH IS TO NOT USE THE INCOME TAX STRUCTURE. WHAT AND I ADMIT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE TAX CREDIT PART OF IT IS IN OUR BILLS WELL BUT WE'RE STILL WE'RE STILL SOMEWHAT IN FLUX AND IS HOW HOW WE COULD MAKE? US TO MAKE THIS WORK -- THIS THE THE MANDATE AS I UNDERSTAND IT WOULDN'T TAKE EFFECT UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT BY LAW BUT THE REVENUE WOULDN'T COME UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY ONE BECAUSE YOU BECAUSE OF THE FOR THE WAY TAXES ARE FILED. SO THAT MEANS. A COUPLE YEARS OF SO SIGNIFICANT GENERAL FUND SO BACK FROM MECHANICALLY HOW THIS WOULD WORK YES WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT IT WOULD THERE BE A GENERAL FUND -- SHOULD THE JENNIFER WILL BE ON THE HOOK FOR THE FIRST FEW YEARS BEFORE THOSE PENALTY REVENUES -- ACTUALLY ACCRUED TO THE GENERAL FUND BASED OFF THE THE FIRST YEAR THE MANDATE PENALTY AND SO I THINK. THE REASON WHY THE ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSING TO DEPOSIT PENALTY REVENUE INTO THE GENERAL FUND AND PAY FOR THE SUBSIDY PROGRAM OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND. I NATIONALLY WE HAD CONTEMPLATED SETTING UP A SPECIAL FUND TO DO THIS BUT BECAUSE OF THE TIMING DELAYS WITH THE KIND OF ONE THE REVENUE WOULD ACTUALLY -- COME INTO THE STATE WERE HIS ONE WE'D WANTED TO START THIS PROGRAM THAT DATES JUST DIDN'T OUTLINE. SO SO IS MY IS MY UNDERSTANDING AND THAT THE THE THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN IS THAT THE BUT IS THERE ANY WOULD THERE BE ANY GENERAL FUND. EXPENDITURE -- BE ON THE PENALTIES IN TO HELP WITH THE WITH THE AFFORDABILITY. RIGHT NOW THERE ISN'T DOES NOT INTEND RIGHT NOW THE ANTENNAS THAT TRACK IS CLOSER TO THE PENALTY REVENUE AS POSSIBLE WITH THE TIMING ISSUE OBVIOUSLY THE FIRST YEAR IS GOING TO BE BASED HEAVILY ON THOSE REVENUE. ESTIMATES THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THAT TO BE TO DEVELOP RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT A MULTI YEAR REVENUE ESTIMATE -- BASED OFF THE PROPOSAL WE HAVE IT MAKES SENSE TO LOOK AT THE REVENUE WE THINK WE COLLECT IN THE FIRST YEAR. SECOND YEAR AND THIRD YEAR TO KIND OF HAVE A YOU -- OVER ARCHING REVENUE ESTIMATE TO BEST DESIGN THAT SUBSIDY PROGRAM -- BUT YOU ARE CORRECT THERE WOULD BE SOME TIMING ISSUES IN TERMS OF ON THE DOLLARS WOULD COME IN AND WHEN THE SUBSIDY PROGRAM WITH FIRST START. MAKING THOSE PAYMENTS. SO OTHER THAN ADMINISTERING THIS IT'S NOT THERE REALLY ISN'T -- THE STATE IS IS THERE TO HELP YOU IT'S IT'S WE'RE HERE. TO USE THE PENALTY MONEY TO PAY FOR THIS [inaudible] SO. AM I MISSING SOMETHING HERE THAT. I THINK. AGAIN WITH THE SAUCE THE PROGRAM GENERALLY THE ANTENNAS TO HELP THE BROADER ISSUE AFFORDABILITY BUT WITH THIS PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR HAS IDENTIFIED A PARTICULAR FUNDING SOURCE FOR THIS PROPOSAL AND THAT'S IT IT IS ENTIRELY SO THERE'S NO THERE'S NO INTENT NO INTENTION FOR ADDITIONAL MONEY. TO HELP WITH AFFORDABILITY IT'S JUST GONNA BE BASED ON THE PANEL. WHICH WON'T BE FOR AWHILE YET SO SO HOW HOW WAS HOW WAS HOUSING ADMINISTRATION GOING TO HOW HOW IS THE ADMINISTRATION GOING TO PROJECT. HOW MUCH REVENUE WILL BE AND AND WHAT HAPPENS IF IF IT'S? UNDER PROJECTED ROBERT OVER PROJECTED I'M A NO I WOULD DO WE REALLY KNOW WE NEED WE MIGHT I MEAN MAYBE THIS QUESTION FOR CANCER COVER CALIFORNIA. DO WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT WHAT THE WHAT THE PANEL WELL GUESS WHAT THE PENALTY IS GOING TO BE. AND WHAT KIND OF REVENUE IT WOULD GENERATE. AND AND SO WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE F. T. B. AND COVER CALIFORNIA MODEL WHAT THAT PENALTY REVENUE WOULD LOOK LIKE AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY. WE HAVE THE IRS DATA THAT IS OUR ACTUAL FOR WHAT CALIFORNIA'S PAY FOR THE FEDERAL PENALTY BECAUSE WE'RE NEARING THE FINAL FEDERAL PENALTY SO CLOSELY THAT'S A GOOD STARTING POINT. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME VERY ABILITY WITH OUR DIFFERENT FILING THRESHOLDS -- LACKING THE MANDATE FOR A YEAR HOW WHAT IMPACT THAT HAD ON THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE INSURANCE SO THAT. AMOUNT PROBABLY INCREASE COMPARED WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IF WE HAD MAINTAINED THAT PENALTY ON GOING. AND I THINK. I THINK MODELING THIS WERE BEING VERY COGNIZANT OF THE FLUCTUATION OF VERY ABILITY CONCERNS OUT THERE ARE. RELATED TO CHANGING THAT SUBSIDY AMOUNT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. AND SO THERE ARE MULTIPLE. OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO DESIGN A SUBSIDY PROGRAM THAT. LOOKS AT THE THREE YEAR PERIOD OF AVAILABLE FUNDING AND TRYING TO MODEL IT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IN A WAY THAT. MAYBE LIMITS THAT VARIABILITY YOUR TWO YEAR. SO WHAT IS THE IS SO WE'RE WE'RE IN THE PROCESS THE MODELING NOW SO WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA OF WHAT FOOT ROUGHLY WHAT THAT'S GOING TO BE. AT THIS TIME THE ONLY NUMBER I CAN SHARE WITH YOU IS THAT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ESTIMATE LESS 26% FOR THE CALIFORNIA FILING THRESHOLD WERE HOPING TO HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WE WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL NUMBERS TO SHARE WITH YOU I'M A REVISION. AND THAT POTENTIALLY -- HELPS WITH WHAT TWENTY TO THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH IS THAT ROUGHLY WHAT WE'RE PROJECTING AS FAR AS I THOUGHT I GET THAT SO MAKE NEXT QUESTION GOING TO BE. TO THANK YOU I JUST WANT NO I MEAN IS IT GONNA HELPERS AGAIN OUT TWENTY THIRTY DOLLARS A MONTH IS THAT GOING TO HELP. IN WORK KATY REBEL COVER CALIFORNIA WERE ALSO PROVIDING SUPPORT TO THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS I THINK THE FUNDING WILL LOOK DIFFERENT THE AMOUNT OF STATE SUPPORT WILL LOOK DIFFERENT UNDER 4100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WERE WILL BE ADDING. TO AN THAT FURTHER ADDING TO THE FEDERAL CAP THAT EXISTS. OVER 4100% WILL BE PUTTING A CAP IN PLACE RIGHT NOW SO CONSUMERS TODAY PAY ANY PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME THAT IT WORKS OUT TO THE PREMIUM AS A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR INCOME. WILL BE PUTTING IN A CAP AND SO THOSE CONSUMERS WILL THEN HAVE THE BENEFIT OF A SIMILAR STRUCTURE THAT PEOPLE DO WITH THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT TODAY. THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT POINT THANK YOU. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BUT THEN MY FINAL QUESTION THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR I I APOLOGIZE FROM TAKING UP TOO MUCH TIME HERE. SO THE THE MANDATE PENALTY IS GOING TO GO ON IN PERPETUITY. BUT THE PROGRAM SUNSETS IN. TWENTY TWENTY TWO I'M SORRY I'M I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. SO I THINK WITH THESE WITH THE SUBSIDY PROGRAM HAVING THE SUNSET PERIOD AND TWENTY TWENTY TWO ALLOWS TO ASSESS WHETHER OR NOT THE PROGRAM IS ACHIEVING THE BROADER GOALS OF AFFORDABILITY THAT WE'VE LAID OUT. REGARDING THE PENALTY SIDE -- YOU ARE CORRECT THAT THE PENALTY ITSELF DOES NOT SUNSET TO TWENTY TWENTY TWO THERE IS LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT WOULD TIE IT. THAT WOULD ADJUSTED AUTOMATICALLY IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WERE TO REINSTATE A PENALTY AT THEIR LEVEL AND SO THE CALIFORNIA PENALTY WOULD DECREASE CORRESPONDINGLY. I THINK. OVERALL AS NOTED BY THE GOVERNOR -- ADDRESSING THESE AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGE WILL TAKE FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP IN FEDERAL ACTION I THINK THAT THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN TRYING. TO ADDRESS THESE AFFORDABILITY OF AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES WERE WE CAN BUT IT WILL. TAKE FOR THE CORONATION AND FOR THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO TRY TO BROADEN THE ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY. SO I GUESS I GUESS WHAT I'M WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS IS WHITE WIRE. WITH WHY NOT HAVE LANGUAGE THAT SAYS THAT -- THAT LEAVES A MORE OPEN ENDED I MEAN THE LAST. WITH THE SUNSET THAT REQUIRES YOU GONNA HAVE TO COME BACK WITH ANOTHER BILL AT SOME POINT IF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOESN'T. GET THEIR ACT TOGETHER OR OR WE DON'T BUT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO COURT AND AND I'M NOT SURE. IF WE DON'T GET A COOPERATION WE DON'T GET SOMETHING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS NOT THAT FAR AWAY AND AND SO -- IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO COLLECT TO THE THE THE REV THE PENALTY REVENUE -- AYE AYE I JUST. IS THERE A WAY TO STRUCTURE THIS SO THAT THE LANGUAGE WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW THIS IF IF THE IF IF THEREIS NO AGREEMENT THAT THE PROGRAM CAN CONTINUE RATHER THAN. HAVING TO GO BACK AND RE RE INSTITUTE THIS THIS OVER AGAIN AS HAS THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER THAT -- I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THOSE COMMENTS BACK AND AND WE CAN. WE WILL DEFINITELY CONSIDER THE COST THERE MAKING RIGHT NOW WE HAVE CERTAINLY HEARD THOSE COMMENTS FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDERS REGARDING THE SUNSET PERIOD FOR THE SUNSET FOR THE SUBSIDY PROGRAM SO IN MY FINAL QUESTION -- SO WHAT HAPPENS TO THE REST OF THE REV PENALTY REVENUE -- IF THE PROGRAM SUNSETS WORDS AGO AT THIS TIME I DON'T THINK THAT WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL DETAILS TO SHARE ON THAT THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION FROM WHAT YOU'RE GIVEN COLLECTED BUT BUT YOU SO THERE'S WAS GONNA GO SOMEWHERE ALL RIGHT NOW IF IF THE PROGRAM SUNSET AT DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THE MANDATE STATE AND AFFECT POST TWENTY TWENTY TWO YES THOSE WERE PENALTY REVENUES WOULD BE DEPOSITED DIRECTLY INTO THE GENERAL FUND FOR USE FOR HEALTH CARE OR SOMETHING ELSE THERE'S NOTHING IN THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD THAT WOULD SPECIFIC PURPOSE IT WOULD DIE I GUESS WHICH IS ASSN MAYBE THE MINISTRATION CONSIDER THAT THAT FUNDING BE USED FOR ADDITIONAL HEALTH CARE AFFORDABILITY THANK

NUMBER THREE I THINK FOR ME OKAY SORRY TRYING TO RAIN ON ANYBODY'S PARADE WE HAVE TWO PANELS LET'S BEGIN WITH THE FIRST PANEL IF YOU WOULD PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON TURN MEMBERS -- MY NAME IS DEEPENING EGNATIA REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER OF THE PROPOSAL TO EXTEND MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY TO ALL ADULTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS OUR FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR PROPOSING A MEDICAL EXPANSION TO AGE TWENTY FIVE I AM AND IT'S JANUARY BUDGET CALIFORNIA IS THAT THE POLICY IN ADVANCING BOLD PRO IMMIGRANT POLICIES INCLUDING THE PASSAGE OF HEALTH FOR ALL KIDS WHICH TO DATE HAS AND ROLLED OVER TWO HUNDRED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN AND LIFESAVING HEALTHCARE THROUGH MEDICARE THESE CHILDREN WILL AGE OUT OF THE MEDICAL SYSTEM AT AGE NINETEEN WITHOUT ANY OPTIONS TO CONTINUE OR MAINTAIN THEIR COVERAGE I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ONE IN SIX CALIFORNIA CHILDREN HAS AT LEAST ONE UNDOCUMENTED PARENT SADLY THESE PARENTS ALONG WITH OLDER SIBLINGS AND GRANDPARENTS CONTINUE TO BE SYSTEMATICALLY EXCLUDED FROM ACCESSING COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE AMONG THE MANY STORIES THE FAMILY'S DEVASTATED BY THEIR LACK OF HEALTH INSURANCE AS THAT OF MARIA AND HAVE THEIR PARENTS TO THREE CHILDREN WHO LIVE JUST OUTSIDE OF SAN FRANCISCO WHEN HOW THERE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES HE AND HIS WIFE TRAVEL TO MEXICO FOR DOCTOR VISITS AN INSULIN LAST YEAR THEY CROSS THE BORDER SIMPLY FOR INSULIN AND THEY'RE UNABLE TO RETURN TO THEIR CHILDREN AND COMMUNITY THIS STORY IS WELL COUNTLESS OTHER SHOWS THE PAINFUL REALITY THAT FAMILY SEPARATION IS NOT JUST A RESULT WITH OTHER RESULT OF WALLS AND BANDS FAMILY SEPARATION CAN ALSO RESULT FROM DEEP INEQUITIES IN OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AN INVISIBLE INVISIBLE BUT CRITICAL REASON FOR ASKING FOR THE COMMITTEES SUPPORT -- IS BECAUSE OF THE SUBSTANTIAL CONTRIBUTION UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS MAKE TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY THROUGH THEIR WORK. THEY CONTRIBUTE THREE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS EVERY YEAR AND STATE AND LOCAL TAXES AND MAKE UP CLOSE TO ONE TENTH OF OUR STATE'S WORK FORCE. FROM AGRICULTURE CONSTRUCTION THE MAX DOMESTIC WORKERS JUST SERVICE WORK IMMIGRANT WORKERS ARE HEAVILY REPRESENTED IN INDUSTRIES THE HIGH RISK OF INJURY ON THE JOB AND A LOW RATE OF EMPLOYER PROVIDED BENEFITS INCLUDING HEALTH INSURANCE. IN THE RECENT WILDFIRES WHO HEARD FROM MANY IMMIGRANT WORKERS WERE EXPOSED TO THE TOXIC WILD FIRE SMOKE -- WHICH CAN REDUCE LUNG FUNCTION IN CAUSE CANCER AND EVEN PREMATURE DEATH. IT EXPANDED MEDICAID OUT WOULD ENSURE THAT WE PROVIDE LIFESAVING TREATMENTS THAT SIMPLY ALLOWED THESE FAMILIES TO SURVIVE. UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS CAN CONSTITUTE THE THE SINGLE LARGEST GROUP WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S REMAINING UNINSURED POPULATION AND CALIFORNIA STANDS AS A BEACON OF HOPE AND A MOMENT WHILE THE FEDERAL ATTACKS IN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. REMAIN RELENTLESS AND FOR THESE REASONS WE DO RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR SUPPORT OF THE STATE COLOR PROPOSAL THANKS SO MUCH. NEXT GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS RONALD COLMAN HERE BEHALF OF THE BEHALF OF HEALTH ACT OF CALIFORNIA WE THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER REYES AND SUBCOMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING US TO PRESENT IN THE EXPANSION TO UNDOCUMENTED CALIFORNIANS. HEALTH ACCESS IF THE STATE WIDE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION COMMITTED TO QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT GOVERNOR NEWSOME'S PROPOSAL EXPAND FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL TO ALL UNDOCUMENTED YOUNG ADULTS UP TO AGE TWENTY FIVE WITH AN INVESTMENT OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS BUILDING ON HEALTH FOR ALL KIDS IN COVERING UP TO A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND MORE LIVES. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL CALIFORNIA WOULD BE THE FIRST STATE TO PROVIDE COVERAGE TO AN ADULT POPULATION OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IN THEIR STATE MEDICAID PROGRAM WE ARE THRILLED THAT DH CS HAS ALREADY BEGUN EFFORTS. TO MOVE IMPLEMENTATION FORWARD OF THIS PROPOSAL IDENTIFYING THE NEED THE VARIOUS SUBPOPULATIONS AND THE PROCEDURAL HURDLES FOR THEM AS WE TRY TO OPEN ENROLLMENT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER JULY FIRST. TWENTY NINETEEN WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S VISION AND COMMITMENT TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE AND ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATURE TO BUILD ON THIS PROPOSAL WITH A TWO BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT AS WE ALL KNOW ADULT UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS CONTINUE TO SUFFER. FROM BEING LOCKED OUT OF ACCESS TO CARE DUE TO THESE EXTRA. THESE DISCRIMINATORY EXCLUSIONS. UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS OVER AGE TWENTY SIX ARE THE CARETAKERS THE PARENTS THE GRANDPARENTS OF THE KIDS AND THE YOUNG ADULTS WHO WOULD BECOME ELIGIBLE WHAT BUT WOULD STILL BE LOCKED OUT OF ACCESS TO CARE. THEMSELVES EXPANDING MEDICAID TO ALL LOW INCOME ADULTS REGARDLESS OF AN IMMIGRATION STATUS WOULD EXTEND APPROXIMATELY WOULD EXTEND ELIGIBILITY TO APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT ONE FIVE MILLION. UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS BY TWENTY TWENTY REDUCING CALIFORNIA'S UNINSURED RATE BY AT LEAST A QUARTER. ONE POINT ZERO FIVE MILLION WOULDN'T ROLL IMMEDIATELY THROUGH FROM A RESTRICTED SCOTT MEDI CAL OFTEN OVERLOOKED MANY UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ACTUALLY HAVE EMPLOYMENT BASED JOB COVERAGE BUT MANY LOW INCOME UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ARE NOT OFFERED SUCH. WORKERS ARE UNINSURED COMPARED TO JUST 10% OF THEIR LAWFULLY PRESENT COUNTERPARTS ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IS EXTREMELY LIMITED CURRENTLY THE UNDOCUMENTED ALREADY ELIGIBLE FOR EMERGENCY RESTRICTED GOT MEDI CAL. CERTAINLY THAT IS ONLY FOR EMERGENCIES ONLY STABILIZES THE YOU IT DOES NOT TREAT YOU FOR WHAT COULD BE A CHRONIC DISEASE IT DOESN'T COME WITH A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER DOESN'T COME WITH A MEDICAL HOME. DOESN'T COME WITH PREVENTIVE CARE OR ANY ACCESS O PRESCRIPTION DRUGS DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY LIVE. UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS CERTAINLY MAY HAVE ACCESS TO A COUNTY PROGRAM BUT OFTEN IN MANY RURAL AREAS SERVICE IS LIMITED SOME SIMPLY GO WITHOUT CARE AND RESORT TO HOME REMEDIES PEOPLE WHO ARE -- UNINSURED OFTEN LIVE SICKER A DIE YOUNGER HAVE WORSE HEALTH OUTCOMES LACK OF HEALTH INSURANCE ALSO MEANS THAT YOU COULD BE ONE INJURY AWAY FROM SERIOUS FINANCIAL CALAMITY OR MEDICAL DEBT. CALIFORNIA WILL LIKELY NEVER BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF POVERTY IF IT DOESN'T FIND A WAY TO ADDRESS HOW ECONOMIC SUPPORT AND PUBLIC PROGRAMS MAKE IT TO THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION AND FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOU. TO MAKE INVESTMENTS TO BUILD ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO ENSURE THAT NO ONE IN OUR STATE SUFFERS OR DIES FROM EASILY TREATABLE ILLNESS SIMPLY BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY WERE BORN THANK YOU THANK YOU. I LET'S -- GO TO PANEL TO PLEASE. I MADAM CHAIR MARY CAMPBELL DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO JUST BRIEFLY TO TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING -- WE ARE PROPOSING AN EXPANSION OF A FULL SCOPE MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR THOSE WHO ARE UP TO THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX UP THROUGH AND INCLUDING TWENTY FIVE AND I WOULD ALWAYS GETS CONFUSING. SO IF YOU'RE TWENTY FIVE YES IF YOU'RE TWENTY SIX NO JUST TO BE PERFECTLY CLEAR -- MET THIS IS REALLY BUILDING ON THE PREVIOUS EXPANSIONS THAT HAVE HAPPENED UNDER PRIOR ADMINISTRATION AND AGAIN I THINK AS YOU'VE HEARD THE GOVERNOR TALK ABOUT HE REALLY DOES SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF COVERAGE FOR ALL PEOPLE AND REALLY THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL DOWN PAYMENT ON THAT AS WE TRY. TO WORK TOWARDS THAT GOAL WHILE ALSO RECOGNIZING THE LIMITATIONS THAT WE HAVE WITH STATE FUNDING -- IN TERMS OF OVERALL FUNDING WE ARE ESTIMATING A NET COST TO THE GENERAL FUND OF A HUNDRED NINETY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS. FOR A FULL YEAR OF AND ROMANCE -- IN ESTIMATING ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD BECOME ENROLLED IN FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL I WILL SAY THAT WE ARE WORKING ON REFINEMENTS TO THESE ESTIMATES BOTH FROM AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF JULY. ONE GIVE AND SORT OF THE TIMING THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOR US TO MAKE THE SYSTEM CHANGES AS WELL AS RECOGNIZING SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE LA -- IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAME UP WITH OUR ESTIMATE SO WE ARE REFINING THAT AND CERTAINLY WILL HAVE UPDATED NUMBERS IN MAY TWO IT HOPEFULLY ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED [inaudible] THANK YOU. LARA ALLOWED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AS HE DID WITH THE GOVERNOR IS A PROPOSAL -- THE FISCAL ANY FISCAL QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. WONDERFUL THANK YOU [inaudible] FOR THEN JOHNSON -- YEP AND JOHNSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- THE ONLY THING I WOULD NOTE IS -- YET WE DID REYES -- SOME CONCERNS AROUND THE COST ESTIMATE BEING -- PROT LIKELY NOT BEING ABLE TO BE IN THAT POLICY NOT BEING ABLE TO BE IMPLEMENTED ON JULY FIRST AS WELL AS PERHAPS AN OVER ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO DIDN'T ROLL AND SO HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS. IS TAKING THOSE CONCERNS AND AND DEVELOPING NEW ESTIMATES THERE -- WE WE WE DID PRODUCE AN ANALYSIS OF OF THE PROPOSAL AND I I WON'T RICK RECAPITULATE THAT HERE BUT WE DO JUST SHARE THAT THIS DOES PRESENT AN OPPORTUNITY LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AMONG HIS PRIORITIES IN IN THE EXPANSION OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE [inaudible] THANK YOU. TO BRING IT TO THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] DOCTOR WOULD. I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY I'M SUPPORTIVE -- IT'S I I'M I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A FIRM BELIEVER THAT -- FINDING A WAY HAVE EVERYBODY COVERED -- IS THE BEST POSSIBLE WAY FOR THE SYSTEM TO WORK -- AND WE DO LESS ANYONE IS PEOPLE. SEEKING CARE IN THE MOST EXPENSIVE WAY POSSIBLE THROUGH EMERGENCY ROOM SO. AT THE PREVENTIVE CARE -- EARLY EARLY INTERVENTION FROM CHRONIC DISEASES THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE BIG -- BIG POTENTIAL -- COST SAVERS AND QUALITY OF LIFE -- ISSUES FOR SO MANY PEOPLE SO I I AM I AM SUPPORTIVE -- I I WILL -- I WILL POINT OUT -- AN ONGOING CONCERN AND THAT IS AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE -- SOMETHING I TALK ABOUT FOR A LONG TIME -- AND MISTER COLEMAN I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT CHALLENGES AND RURAL COMMUNITIES WE HAVE CHALLENGES FOR PEOPLE ACCESSING CARE IN LARGE URBAN AREAS AS WELL -- THERE OFTEN COULD PLACES IN -- LARGER URBAN AREAS WHERE IT'S DIFFICULT TO FIND PROVIDERS -- TO CARE FOR POPULATIONS OF FOLKS THAT ARE ACTUALLY IT'S PRETTY ACCESSIBLE PHYSICALLY ACCESSIBLE FOR THEM TO BE THERE -- WHICH WHICH MEANS WHICH IS POINTS TO THE HUGE CHALLENGES WE HAVE WITH WORKFORCE. WE STRUGGLED MIGHTILY WITH PRIMARY CARE WORK FORCE IN GENERAL AND IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND -- SIMPLY TELLING PEOPLE YOU NOW HAVE COVERAGE AND YOU HAVE NOWHERE TO GO ON BECAUSE THERE IS AN ADEQUATE CUTS OF PROVIDER NETWORK THERE ISN'T GOING TO HELP AND SO WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO FOCUS ON THAT AS WELL. SO I THANK YOU FOR THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD. I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME.

SAY THEY AGREE WITH THIS WE NEED TO PROVIDE. THE HEALTH COVERAGE TO EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS THAT'S AS IT SHOULD BE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. AND I WOULD LIKE TO CALL UP -- THE PANEL ISSUE NUMBER FOUR WELCOME. MERRY CAM TWELVE LET'S START WITH YOU. I WILL ACTUALLY DEFERRED TO MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE COLLEAGUES TO PRESENT THIS ITEM VERY GOOD. CHANNING WHEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO NINETEEN NINETY ONE RE ALIGNMENT. TODAY WE WILL BE WILL BE SPEAKING SPECIFICALLY TO A. B.. EIGHTY FIVE IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO INCREASE THE REDIRECTION AMOUNTS OF THE COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAM BOARD AND CERTAIN OTHER. COUNTIES INDIGENT HEALTHCARE REALIGNMENT RABBANI. THIS WOULD RESULT IN SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL FUND SAVINGS IN THE COW WORKS PROGRAM. AT THE STATE TAKES ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR PROVIDING HEALTHCARE TO UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS COUNTIES COST AND RESPONSIBILITIES ON A DIGIT HEALTHCARE ARE EXPECTED TO DECREASE. AS SUCH THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD NOT IMPACT THAT THIRTY FOUR CM MUSKY COUNTIES BUT ONLY TWO THAT'S HIM AS HE POURED. WHICH HAS A SIGNIFICANT OPERATING RESERVE OF OVER THREE HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS. AS FOR THE OTHER. FIVE COUNTIES THAT ARE IMPACTED OTHER SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS APPROXIMATELY 24% OR FOURTEEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE RE DIRECTED FROM THOSE COUNTIES. WE HAVE HEARD THE CONCERNS AROUND OUR PROPOSAL AND WE'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT WHILE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD BE DIRECT ADDITIONAL REALIGNMENT REVENUES FROM COUNTIES. OF THE REDUCTION OF COUNTIES I EACH AS ASKED AMMO YOU COST IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WOULD RESULT IN TWO HUNDRED FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN COUNTY SAVINGS [inaudible] THANK YOU. NEXT COME BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- WE WE ANALYZE THIS ISSUE IN A COUPLE OF REPORTS ONE ON THE MEDI CAL SPECIFICALLY AND ONE ON THE GENERAL REALIGNMENT STRUCTURE. AND WE FIND THAT -- FOR THE A. B. EIGHTY FIVE PROPOSAL THAT SOME INCREASE IN THE RE DIRECTION -- IS LIKELY APPROPRIATE. TO A HELP -- PAY FOR THE COST OF THE EXPANSION BUT MORE SO TO ACCOUNT FOR SOME OF THE COSTS THAT THE STATE HAS TAKEN ON FOR EXPANDING COVERAGE -- WE BELIEVE IT'S APPROPRIATE GIVEN -- THAT HOW HOW INDIGENT CARE CASELOADS HAVE GONE DOWN AND ALSO FOR THE REASON THAT -- THE CMS P. BOARD HAS ACCUMULATED A LARGE RESERVE THAT WOULD TAKE MANY YEARS TO SPEND DOWN -- EVEN UNDER ITS CURRENT BUDGET WITH THAT WITH THE COVERAGE EXPANSION. THAT SAID WE DO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE SCOPE AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROPOSED INCREASE IN THE REDIRECTION -- FIRST WE BELIEVE IT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON CERTAIN COUNTIES NOT NOT THE C. M. S. P. COUNTIES BUT FIVE OTHER COUNTIES -- ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THEIR EXISTING PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES AND THEN SECOND EVEN WITH REGARD TO THE CMS BE IT THE THE PROPOSAL DOES CALL INTO QUESTION ITS VIABILITY GOING FORWARD. AS THE C. M. S. P. BOARD -- WHICH DELIVERS ENGINE HEALTHCARE ON BEHALF OF THE PARTICIPATING COUNTIES WOULD RECEIVE -- NO FUNDING -- FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE -- EVENTUALLY MAYBE THERE WOULD BE HAVE TO BE CHANGES -- TO TO THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE OR SO FORTH TO ALLOW IT TO HAVE FUNDING GOING FORWARD SHOULD THERE BE A REMAINING UNINSURED POPULATION THAT WE WHICH I BOARD TO SERVE SO HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] THANK YOU. WHICH KEPT OVER. PETER BE LONESOME HI. HUNTER PETERBILT SEMIREGULAR THIS TIME. SORRY AND DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY ONE OF THE FOUR COUNTIES THAT ARE. PARTICULARLY -- AFFECTED BY THIS WEEK'S TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE IDEA BEHIND THIS IN TERMS OF INCREASING COVERAGE FOR THE UNDOCUMENTED YOUNG FOLKS. IN FACT WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT AND MORE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND BECAUSE OF THIS REALIGNMENT -- BECAUSE WHAT WE CALL THE CALL BACK -- IT REALLY IMPACTS OUR SERVICES TO UNDOCUMENTED FOLKS WE SERVE. FOUR THOUSAND ADULTS ENDS WITH A UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS ARE HEALTHY PARTNERS PROGRAM CURRENTLY **** COME COMPLETELY FUNDED. RUN BY THE COUNTY OF SACRAMENTO. AND ONLY ONE HUNDRED OF OUR FOUR THOUSAND FOLKS ARE UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE OR TWENTY FIVE OR UNDER IS ONLY TWO POINT 5% WOULD BENEFIT FROM THIS PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR. NINETY SEVEN POINT 5% OF OUR FOLKS WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE A HIT. IN TERMS OF SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED TO THEM IN FACT WE HAVE TO CUT ABOUT 75% OF ALL SERVICES. TO ARE UNDOCUMENTED FOLKS WHO ARE OLDER THAN TWENTY FIVE IN ADDITION WE THINK THAT THE AMOUNT OF ALLOCATED TO THE SLICE OF THE POPULATION. IS SOMEWHAT OVERESTIMATED BECAUSE AS THE AS THE WHERE YOU FROM L. L. L.. L. L. SO WHERE YOU FROM. HELLO. I USED TO SAID [inaudible] SORRY. THE THIS POPULATION IS LESS EXPENSIVE THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION THEY TEND NOT TO COME IN FOR CARE. FOR A FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL REASONS MAINLY WHEN THEY THE THING THAT THEIR MOST AT RISK FOR IN TERMS OF A HIGH COST SERVICES -- BE CARE WHICH IS COVERED BY MEDICARE AL. SO WE THINK ACTUALLY IN ADDITION TO THIS BEING IN A TRIP TO THE FOR COUNTIES THAT ARE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED -- IN PARTICULAR SACRAMENTO BECAUSE WE PROVIDE THE UNDOCUMENTED CARE IN ADDITION TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH ASPECTS THAT ARE THAT THESE CUTS WILL ALSO WRITTEN ENTAIL -- THAT IT IS THERE'S A BETTER WAY POTENTIALLY OF GETTING THE FUNDING FOR THIS POPULATION. AND I SHOULD JUST AT REAL QUICKLY ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE STANISLAUS AND HE SEES ME US. GLASSER STANISLAUS SANTA BARBARA AND SACRAMENTO COUNTY WILL BE PARTICULARLY AFFECTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH RAINY REALM IN ADDITION TO THIS ON DOCUMENTS SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE. IN TERMS OF STD CLINICS BEING CLOSED AND COMMUNICABLE DISEASE INVESTIGATORS. BEING SHUT DOWN AT PARTICULARLY AT A TIME WHEN WE NOW HAVE MEASLES CASES IN THE REGION AND WE DON'T WANT TO BE SENDING THOSE SERVICES DOWN. SIDE RESPECTIVELY RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THIS BUDGET. THE AMOUNT OF FOURTEEN FIFTEEN BILLION COME FROM SOME OTHER SOURCE [inaudible] THANK YOU -- WELL LOOK AMONG THREE GUESTS. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS WHETHER LOOK THE MAGIC AS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- WE ARE EVALUATING DATA AND HAVE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH COUNTIES TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS OF OUR OUR PROPOSAL THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. OKAY WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THAT THAT WOULD BE DONE THE EVALUATION OF THE DATA DATA. IT'S AN ONGOING DIALOGUE OF COURSE WE HAVE OUR UPDATE -- AT ME REVISION -- BUT JUST JUST TO PUT IT OUT THERE THAT WE HAVE HER WE HAVE HEARD THE CONCERNS ON ON OUR PROPOSAL. VERY GOOD ESPECIALLY FROM THE COUNTY'S MOST THAT WOULD BE MOST AFFECTED. YEAH WE MET WITH SACRAMENTO COUNTY. THEY'RE THE CLOSEST ONE RIGHT. ALL RIGHT WONDERFUL -- QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS. ALRIGHT LET'S OPEN IT UP -- MADAM CHAIR. IT'S JUST A REAL QUICK ON THE COUNTIES CONCERNS IS THIS THE THE THE LIST THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY SANTA BARBARA -- SACRAMENTO YOLO COUNTY AS ARE OTHER COUNTIES ALSO INCLUDED IN THAT. WESTERN STANISLAUS. SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE IMPACT THAT IT WILL HAVE ON COUNTIES WERE ACTUALLY -- DOING A BROAD LOOK AT THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES A SERRA WE JUST DOING A SAMPLE OF THOSE ARE RAISING CONCERN SO. DOES LIKE MY COLLEAGUE NOTED THAT CM. THIRTY FOUR CMS BEATS MSP COUNTIES WILL NOT BE IMPACTED BECAUSE OF THE WAY -- THE THE BOARD -- SORT OF WHAT WE CALL IT A CONGLOMERATION IT'S UNDER SORT OF THE THE PORTS FOR REVIEW -- DESPITE THE CIVIC COUNTIES -- FOR A. B. EIGHTY FIVE PURPOSES -- ITSELF FOR A SIXTY FORTY A SIXTY FORTY BUT PERCENT FORMULA ONE MEAN IN TERMS OF THEIR REACH -- AB FIVE A DIRECTION. THE OTHER COUNTIES -- WE EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE IMPACTS -- IN TERMS OF DECREASES TO INDIGENT CARE BUT THOSE OTHER COUNTIES THEIR FORMULA BASED COUNTIES AND THE AB EIGHTY FIVE EVERY DIRECTION HAPPENS TWO YEARS DOWN THE ROAD SO WE EXPECT THAT THAT THOSE COUNTIES WILL BE IMPACTED ON THE NATURAL. SO OUT OF THE FIFTY EIGHT HOW MANY DO YOU THINK WILL BE IMPACT. WELL IN NINETEEN TWENTY IT'S THE CMS KEYBOARD AND AND FIVE FIVE COUNTIES. I THINK IT IS CLEAR AND TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY THAT. THIS WOULD BE TERRIBLE FOR THOSE COUNTIES. AND WE DO HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO BE ABLE. TO IT'S TO DO WITH WHAT WE WANT TO DO BUT TO NOT TO BECAUSE THE HARM THAT IS BEING CAUSED. BY THE LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE SO WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO. AND I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE COUNTIES THAT WILL BE MOST AFFECTED BY THIS -- VOICING THEIR CONCERNS SO THAT HE COULD THEN BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] SEEING NONE. I THANK YOU ALL FOR FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. WILL MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER. FIVE I'M SORRY PUBLIC COMMENT THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF MY APOLOGIES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M FAIR MAKE THEY TING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES REPRESENTING ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. I THINK. THIS IS A COMPLICATED ISSUE OBVIOUSLY BUT IF YOU TOTAL IT UP IT'S THIRTY NINE COUNTIES THAT WOULD BE AFFECTED IT'S THE ARTICLE THIRTEEN COUNTIES IN THE C. M. S. P. COUNTIES. AND WHILE THIS ADVERSELY AFFECTED ADVERSELY AFFECTED THE SAME AS PEOPLE WARD THIS. CHANGE IN RATIO FROM SIXTY FORTY TO SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE WOULD AFFECT THE SAME MUST BE BORED BUT THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY AFFECT THE SAME SP COUNTIES AND THE PATH TO HEALTH PROGRAM YOU HEARD ABOUT. ALSO ARE -- ALL THIRTY NINE COUNTIES -- IN VARIOUS WAYS ARE OFFERING SOME SERVICES TO UNDOCUMENTED FOLKS AS WELL AS CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES WHICH YOU HEARD FROM MISTER BE LAINSON AND OTHERS. AND SO THIS PROPOSAL THIS CHANGE FROM SIXTY FORTY TO SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE IS ARBITRARY. IT'S NOT REALLY BASED ON ANY MATH THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE -- WE DO REALIZE THAT WITH THE EXPANSION -- BUT THERE COULD BE SOME SAVINGS ON THE COUNTY SIDE BUT AGAIN -- MANY COUNTIES ARE OFFERING SERVICES TO THESE FOLKS AND SO -- WE LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE IN THE CONVERSATIONS WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND OTHERS TO FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO DO THIS AND THEN LASTLY WE WANT TO SAY THAT -- WILL TWO THINGS SORRY -- THIS IS SEPARATE FROM THE HSS PROPOSAL THAT WAS MENTIONED BY THE FIRST SPEAKER -- THIS IS A MET IN THE HEALTH REALM AND DOES ISN'T IS SEPARATE FROM AYE HSS PROPOSAL. ANY COUNTY SAVINGS ON I JUST PROPOSAL SIDE COUNTY STILL DO CONTRIBUTE THEIR REALIGNMENT TIE IT TO ASSESS SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A SAVINGS PER SE. AND THEY'RE DIFFERENT POTS OF MONEY SO EVEN IF YOU DID SAVE SOMEONE I'D JUST ASIDE WHICH WILL NEVER HAPPEN YOU WILL NEVER SAVE -- YOU CAN'T USE IT FOR THE SORTS OF SERVICES OVER HERE SO IT'S VERY COMPLICATED -- BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OTHERS WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. THANK YOU. MICHELLE GIVENS OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND I THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO WALK BACK IN REAL RECOGNIZE HOW NINETEEN NINETY ONE HEALTH REALIGNMENT IS USED SO IT'S BOTH INDIGENT CARE SERVICES AND THE PROVISION OF THOSE BUT IT'S ALSO. FOR THE PROVISION OF PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES WHICH IS AT PROVIDED TO EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF YOUR CITIZENSHIP STATUS AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE WHEN COUNTIES OPTED FOR THE SIXTY FORTY OUR UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT 40% UNDER THIS DEAL OF AB EIGHTY FIVE IS THAT THAT 40% WOULD BE RETAINED FOR PUBLIC. HEALTH SERVICES AND FOR ANYTHING ELSE THAT THE COUNTIES CHOSE TO DO BUT IT WAS NOT GOING TO BE SWEPT EVERY TIME THERE WOULD BE -- EXPANSION OF MEDIC HOW IN SOME SORT AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO JUST RECALL THAT UNDER THE AB EIGHTY FIVE CONSTRUCT THERE'S A FORMULA AND WITHIN THAT FORMULA THE JURISDICTIONS THAT OPTED TO USE THAT. THERE IS A IS A PROTECTION THERE IT'S A MECHANISM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T -- SWEEP MORE THAN THEIR HISTORICAL MADAM OF MONEY THAT WAS USED FOR INDIGENT SERVICES SO THERE'S AMOUNT OF MONEY OUR PERCENTAGE IT'S ALWAYS RETAIN FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. THESE FIVE JURISDICTIONS THAT WERE NAMES AND JUST PREVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE THAT PROTECTION AND BECAUSE OF THAT THE MONEY THAT WOULD BE A VOTED IN TAKEN BACK AND WOULD DEFINITELY HARM THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CAN'T DO BURKE WITH THE HEALTH OFFICER'S ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HERE TO ECHO THE CONCERNS OF OUR COLLEAGUES AT C. SACK AND SHE ACT. AND TO SAY THAT WE DO SUPPORT EXPANSION OF MEDICARE ALL TO UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS IMMIGRANTS BUT IT'S VITAL THAT WE DO SO WITHOUT HARMING PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THINK YES THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AGAIN KAREN LAYING ON BEHALF OF THE PLASTER AND STANISLAUS COUNTY BOARDSOF SUPERVISORS BOTH WITH STRONG CONCERNS. THE JACKSON'S OF AB EIGHTY FIVE I CHANGE FROM SIXTY FORTY TO SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE THE PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY THAT ARE. THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE KIND AND PLASTER AND STANISLAUS AFFECT. REALLY IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS THAT DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH HEALTH CARE THEY'VE ALSO DONE -- MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS ON WHAT THEY THINK THEY MIGHT SAVE FOR SAYS WHAT ARE THE STATE MIGHT SAVE WITH THE EXPANSION AND THE NUMBERS JUST DON'T ADD UP SO WE WOULD ASK THAT THE COMMITTEE CONTINUE TO PUSH ON DURING THE ANALYSES OF WHAT THEIR REAL SAVINGS ARE. NOT ON THE UP AGAIN OF THE FAMOUS P. COUNTIES YES THERE IS A RESERVE A LOT OF THAT RESERVE IS A ONE TIME PAYMENT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BECAUSE CMS P. SPENT THEMSELVES ALMOST INSOLVENT. TO DO EARLY IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SO YES THERE'S A RESERVE WE'RE TALKING TO THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT IT BUT I IF YOU START OUT THE BOARD. THE BOARD'S DOING THE WORK OF THIRTY FIVE COUNTIES THAT'S IT'S WHY WAS DESIGNED THAT WAY TO FISH AT SO WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE READER ACTION THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING AND AN EXPANSION OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO UNDOCUMENTED PERSONS NOW AND SO WE HAVE TO TAKE ALL THAT A CONSIDERATION. WHEN YOU COME BACK AFTER THE REVISION THANK YOU [inaudible] Q.. MADAM CHAIR CLIFF BURKE HERE BEHALF OF SANTA BARBARA COUNTY I JUST WANT TO ECHO THE CONCERNS YOU'VE HEARD -- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES ALL THE MONEY THAT WOULD BE CUT CURRENTLY GOES TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SANTA BARBARA COUNTY WE'VE CALCULATED THE NUMBERS THE MEDI CAL EXPANSION SAVE THIS LIKE SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND THE CUT IN THE REALIGNMENT FUNDS WILL COST US TWO POINTONE MILLION DOLLARS COMING OUT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SO I MEAN NOT EVEN CLOSE. REALLY DEVASTATING IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH [inaudible] THANK YOU. RAIN X. CALIFORNIA'S DISABILITY RIGHTS FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE MEDI CAL OR MEDICARE SERVICES RIGHT NOW COUNTIES ARE THE LAST DITCH EFFORT FOR THEM TO GET SERVICES IT REALLY AS A PRIMARY CARE CLINIC IS WHERE THEY GO. AND IF DAVID DUKE DO THIS CALL BACK PRIMARY CARE CLINICS WOULD GET HURT ESPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH AND YOU KNOW MENTAL HEALTH IS ALWAYS BEEN SHORT. SHORT SHAFT ALL THE TIME SO. I I BELIEVE YOU CAN HAVE TO FIND A WAY DIFFERENT REVENUES THAT WOULD BE NICE OKAY THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON RONALD COMMON HERE BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA WELL SOME COUNTIES PROVIDE LITTLE OR NO ASSISTANCE TO THE UNDOCUMENTED CERTAINLY THERE ARE COUNTIES THAT DO PROVIDE A MEDICAL HOME OR SOME TYPE OF ACCESS TO UNDOCUMENTED POPULATIONS. CERTAINLY WE SEE THAT IN SACRAMENTO AND YOLO COUNTY SPECIFICALLY -- ADDITIONALLY WE WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE SAME AS P. PATHWAY TO HELP PROGRAM THAT DOES PROVIDE SERVICES FOR ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS WE CERTAINLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT COUNTIES ARE IN THE POSITION OF BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE TO SERVE THE REMAINING UNINSURED INCLUDING THE UNDOCUMENTED IF THEY'RE DOING. SO TODAY AND ALSO BE ABLE TO SERVE THE PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS WE DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO PULL THE RUG OUT OF SOME UNDOCUMENTED COMMITTEE MEMBERS THAT ARE ABLE TO GET SERVICES -- AT AT THE COUNTY LEVEL EVEN IF IT IS JUST A PATCHWORK OF COUNTIES TO DO THIS EXPANSION AND WHATEVER'S LEFT LEGISLATURE -- TO FIND GENERAL FUND -- DOLLARS TO DO SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. WE'RE DONE WITH PUBLIC COMMENT NOW WE CAN MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FIVE GOOD LET'S BEGIN WITH YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT THE BUDGET PROPOSAL TO RAISE THE INCOME LIMIT AT THE AGED AND DISABLED MEDI CAL PROGRAM TO A HUNDRED AND 38% OF THE FEDERAL FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. CREATING PARITY BETWEEN SENIORS AND THE DISABLED MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND OTHER MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE ACA MOST ADULTS CAN NOW QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL IF THEY HAVE AN INCOME BELOW 110038% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. THE ACA HOWEVER DID NOT CHANGE THE INCOME LEVEL FOR THE MEDI CAL AGED AND DISABLED PROGRAM WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO A HUNDRED AND 22% OF THE FEDERAL PART OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. THIS MEANS THAT A SIXTY FOUR YEAR OLD ADULT WITH FREE MEDI CAL CAN LOSE IT. THE DAY THEY TURN SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD. THE SENIOR WITH AN INCOME OF EVEN ONE DOLLAR OVER THE 122% OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL THRESHOLD IS ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE. WITH EXPENSIVE SHERIFF COST THE ONLY WAY FOR SENIORS WITH INCOMES ABOVE A HUNDRED AND 22% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL TO ACCESS MEDI CAL BENEFITS IS TO PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS. IN A MONTHLY MEDI CAL SHARE CROC COST OF OVER SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS PER MONTH WHICH MANY SENIORS SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY. THIS CREATES A SIGNIFICANT BERRY FOR SENIORS TO EXCESS AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. RATED THE AGED RAISING THE AGED AND DISABLED INCOME LIMIT TO A HUNDRED AND 38% OF THE FAR FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE. AND COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO ENSURE LOW INCOME SENIORS HAVE ECOBILL EQUITABLE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE. THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL WOULD ENSURE THAT THE VULNERABLE POPULATION OF LOW INCOME SENIORS ARE TREATED FAIRLY. AND COULD HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE MEDICAL CARE WITHOUT THE SENIOR PENALTY. HERE WITH ME TODAY IS -- LINDA WAY WITH THE WESTERN CENTER FOR LAW AND POVERTY. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERING THIS PROPOSAL. IT IS UNFAIR THAT SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES ARE SUBJECT TO A LOWER INCOME ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLD OF ABOUT A HUNDRED SIXTY DOLLARS LOWER A MONTH TO QUALIFY FOR FREE MEDI CAL IF A SENIOR PERSON. WITH DISABILITY HAS AN INCOME OF MORE THAN TWELVE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO DOLLARS A MONTH HERE SHE CAN ONLY GET FREE MEDIC. CAN GET MEDICARE WITH A SHARE OF THE COST I SHARE CAST IS THE AMOUNT AN INDIVIDUAL MUST PAY FOR THEIR HEALTHCARE BEFORE MEDI CAL KICKS IN. A PERSON'S SHARE COST IF THEIR MONTHLY INCOME MINUS SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS THIS IS BASED ON THE ANTIQUATED IDEA THAT PEOPLE CAN LIVE OFF OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. THIS MAY MADE SENSE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE WHEN THAT THRESHOLD WITH THAT BUT CERTAINLY DOESN'T MAKE SENSE NOW. EVERY YEAR THERE AGING DISABLED INCOME LIMIT LOSES GROUND BUT IS ESPECIALLY HARD FELT THIS YEAR I LEGAL AID ADVOCATES REPORT AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CLIENTS WHO ARE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR FREE MEDI CAL. SIMPLY BECAUSE OF A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT IN THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY. THE AVERAGE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT INCREASE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY IS THIRTY NINE DOLLARS FOR THIS YEAR TEN DOLLARS HIGHER THAN THE AGING DISABLED INCOME INCREASE FROM LAST YEAR. MANY OF THESE RETIREES WOULD HAPPILY GIVE UP THAT EXTRA THIRTY NINE DOLLARS IN INCOME RATHER THAN PAY A SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLAR SHERIFF COST. FORCE BETWEEN PAYING FOR RENT AND FOOD OR THEIR MEDI CAL SHARE OF COSTS MANY FOREGO NEEDED MEDICAL SERVICES PROMPTING THEM TO MOVE INTO A SKIRT SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AT A HIGH COST TO THE STATE. AND EVEN HIGHER PERSONAL COSTS TO THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND WELL BEING. WE URGE THE SECOND SUBCOMMITTEE TO BRING SOME MUCH NEEDED PARITY. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. MERRY. MERRY CAM ALL THE PART OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES SO JUST FROM -- TECHNICAL OPERATION STANDPOINT CERTAINLY IF THE PROPOSAL IS SOMETHING THAT THE STATE COULD SEEK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE ARE FISCAL ISSUES THAT I'LL DEFER TO MY DEPARTMENT FINANCE COLLEAGUE. JUST A COUPLE THINGS TO NOTE ONE WE WOULD OBVIOUSLY NEED FEDERAL APPROVAL TO DO THIS EXPANSION AND THE OTHER BEING THAT -- BECAUSE AS THIS COMMITTEE WEALTH KNOW WHO'S AS DO THE PEOPLE SITTING AT THIS TABLE MEDI CAL BEING AS COMPLICATED AS IT IS. IT'S NOT EXACTLY PARITY BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT INCOME DISREGARD SO I THINK WE WOULD WANT TO UNDERSTAND -- OF WHAT IS THE END GOAL IN TERMS OF IS IT PEOPLE WHO AT THE END AFTER THEIR INCOME DISREGARDS ARE IT'S PARITY SO I THINK THERE'S SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES WE WOULD NEED TO WORK THROUGH SO THAT WE COULD PRESENT THOSE. TO SEE A MASS TO THE DEGREE THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR ENDED UP INCLUDING THE FINAL BUDGET BUT I'LL DEFER THE FISCAL ISSUES TO LARA. LORI L. AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE DON'T HAVE AN UPDATED THE FISCAL ESTIMATE AT THIS TIME BUT WE WANTED TO KNOW. THAT -- FOR THIS PROPOSAL LAST YEAR THE COSTS WERE APPROXIMATELY THIRTY FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND IN THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION RISING TO JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION -- AT FULL IMPLEMENTATION AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S WORKING ON REVISING HAS -- SPOKEN WITH STAKEHOLDER TO STAKEHOLDERS AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THEIR FEEDBACK AND WILL BE REVISING THE ESTIMATE BUT WE JUST WANTED TO NOTE OUR CONCERNS GIVEN THIS WOULD CREE ADDITIONAL COSTS NOT INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET [inaudible] THANK YOU. ONE OF THE COMMENTS FROM A AN ADVOCATE. SAID TO ME THAT THIS ABSOLUTELY LOOKS LIKE. OUT RIGHT AGE DISCRIMINATION. AND IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE VERSUS THE 110038% ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THE OTHER OTHER ELIGIBILITY ISSUES. VERY GOOD ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS. I'M SORRY. I SUPPOSE WE SHOULD BE ASKING THAT TO WE HEAR FROM YOU RIGHT. I APOLOGIZE. RON WE'LL SEE THANK YOU MANAGER AROUND WITH THE WITH THE LA -- DON'T HAVE A LOT TO ADD HERE JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT -- WE REVIEWED THE FISCAL ESTIMATES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTION FROM LAST YEAR -- AND FOUND THEM TO BE LARGELY REASONABLE THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED ABOUT A COUPLE OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT I UNDERSTAND THE DEPARTMENT IS. IS LOOKING AT AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO TO SEEING AN UPDATED ESTIMATE TO TO REVIEW THAT AND CAN PROVIDE FEEDBACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AT THAT TIME WONDERFUL THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. I JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR CONSIDERATION WHEN THE TIME COMES THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH DOCTOR WOULD AND AS A VOTING MEMBER HERE I'M SURE THAT. IT'LL BE GIVEN DUE CONSIDERATION. NOW LET'S OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON RONALD COMING HERE BEHALF OF HEALTH TEXAS CALIFORNIA WHERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL WE DO NOT SEE ANY POLICY RATIONALE HERE AND KNOW THAT SENIORS AND DISABLED POPULATIONS ARE PAYING.

SO THIS AFFECTS FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN THE HOME AS WELL NOT JUST SENIORS AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES BUT A BROAD RANGE OF COMMUNITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HEAVY ARMOR IS ON BEHALF OF LATINO CUSHION FOR HEALTHY CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. WELL THANK YOU -- PANELISTS -- WE'RE GOING. TO MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX IT'S TIME OKAY. LINDA HOW DO YOU PRONOUNCE YOUR LAST NAME. TEN THEIR WITS. OKAY DINNER WEEKS VERY GOOD. WELL LET'S BEGIN WITH YOU LINDA. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- LINDA TO NARROW ITS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK WE ARE YOU STATEWIDE HEALTH ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS TO ENSURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO HELP THE LIVELIHOODS. TO HELP QUALITY HEALTHCARE AND EQUITABLE CONDITIONS WE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT OUR PROPOSAL TO FIND HEALTH COVERAGE OUTREACH ENROLLMENT AND NAVIGATION ASSISTANCE AND HARD TO REACH COMMUNITIES. ARE ASK IS FOR FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR FOR TWO YEARS WHICH WOULD DRIVE DOWN A FEDERAL MATCH FOR A TOTAL OF SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS TO GO TOWARDS THIS CRUCIAL WORK. THE FUNDING STRUCTURE FOR THIS PROGRAM WOULD MIMIC THE AB AT TO PROCESS WHICH WAS ADOPTED IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN WHICH DISPERSED FUNDS COUNTIES BASED ON POPULATION. EIGHT COUNTIES THEN MADE GRANTS AVAILABLE TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO OUTREACH WORK TO HELP FACILITATE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE AND NAVIGATION ASSISTANCE. UNFORTUNATELY THIS FUNDING EXPIRED IN JUNE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND SO DID THAT MORE ROBUST OUTREACH WORK. ACCORDING TO A RECENT UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER BLOG WE KNOW APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO WERE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL DID NOT ENROLLING COVERAGE IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN THIS IS DUE IN PART TO ON AWARENESS THAT OPEN ENROLLMENT IS YEAR ROUND OR THAT COVERAGE IS PREMIUM FREE. WE ALSO HAVE SEEN A CHILLING EFFECT SWEEPING THE STATE AS WELL AS A RESULT OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S ANTI IMMIGRANT RHETORIC WHICH IS HINDERED PEOPLE FROM USING PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. WE FEEL THAT THE TIME IS RIGHT TO INVEST IN OUR COMMUNITY WORKERS WHO ARE TRAINED AND EQUIPPED TO ENSURE THAT POPULATIONS FACING SOME OF THE GREATEST ADVERSITY GET THE INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE THEY NEED TO GET AND STAY COVERED. DOES YOUR COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF WHAT THIS FUNDING MEANS I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY SHARE TWO STORIES ON BEHALF OF MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH ACCESS ABOUT TWO OF THEIR CLIENTS. MISTER MARTINEZ IS A SEVENTY TWO YEAR OLD MAN IN SEVERE PAIN IN SEVERE PAIN AND BOUND TO A WALKER AS A RESULT OF A BRUTAL ASSAULT SIX YEARS AGO. HE HAD RESTRICTED SCOPE COVERAGE UNDER MEDICARE. HE CAME TO US IN PAIN WITH LITTLE HOPE OF EVER WALKING AGAIN. THERE ARE THOROUGH SCREENING WE DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD BEEN ELIGIBLE FOR FULL SCOPE MEDI CAL ALL ALONG. DUE TO HIS VICTIM. DUE TO HIS VICTIM OF CRIME YOU VISA STATUS. WE WORKED ON FIXING HIS MEDI CAL AND WITHIN DAYS HE WAS GRANTED FULL SCOPE COVERAGE. HE CAME TO US AND THANK DOES JUST TWO MONTHS LATER WALKING UNASSISTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SIX YEARS. HE HAD BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE SPINAL SURGERY AND THERAPY WHICH ENABLED HIM TO WALK. THE SECOND CLIENT MISSED HERNANDEZ IS A SINGLE MOTHER OF FOUR US CITIZEN CHILDREN THE YOUNGEST WITH CEREBRAL PALSY. IN THE PROCESS OF ADJUSTING HER IMMIGRATION STATUS SHE WAS ADVISED BY A NORTH AUDIO OR A FAKE IMMIGRATION ATTORNEY TO TERMINATE ANY AND ALL PUBLIC BENEFITS TO AVOID THE RISK A PUBLIC CHARGE. SHE HAD FOLLOWED HIS ADVICE AND TERMINATED ALL OVER CHILDREN'S BENEFITS INCLUDING HER SICK CHILD SSI BENEFITS. AS A RESULT OF THIS SHE FELL DEEPER INTO FINANCIAL TROUBLES TOOK ON A SECOND JOB AS AN UBER DRIVER. YET STRUGGLE TO PAY RENT AND FEED HER CHILDREN. SHE SUFFERED A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN AND LANDED IN THE HOSPITAL. SHE CAME TO US STRESSED IN TEARS AND A MEDICAL THAT. WE COMFORTED HER AND GOT HER THE MEDI CAL BENEFITS BACK ON AND RETROACTIVELY GOT HER HOSPITAL BILLS COVERED. WE REFERRED HER TO OUR CALPERS SPECIALISTS WHO ALSO GOT HER HER NUTRITIONAL BENEFITS BACK. AND THEN TO AN SS I LIAISON TO HELP HER REAPPLY FOR HER CHILD'S LOST AS A SIDE BENEFITS. SO THOSE ARE JUST A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF HOW CRUCIAL THIS OUTREACH WORK AS THE TROUBLESHOOTING AND NAVIGATION SUPPORT WE PROVIDE IS UNIQUE IT'S LIKE NO OTHER. AND ENSURES THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ONLY. ARE NOT ONLY INVOLVED IN COVERAGE BUT ARE ABLE TO UTILIZE THEIR BENEFITS AND ACCESS THEIR SPECIALTY CARE. SO FOR THESE REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT TO FIND COMMUNITY BASED OUT REGION ENROLLMENT EFFORTS IN THE STATE BUDGET AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. MY DEAR FROM METAMORA. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE.

THIS REQUEST IS TO BUILD UPON OF RECENT PAST RECESSES OF THE ENROLLMENT -- IN SUPPORT THE PROPOSED EXPANSION OF MEDICAL COVERAGE AND DEFENSE AGAINST EFFORTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS A REFERENCE TO THAT IS PUBLIC CHURCH. IN -- YEAH OR HER WORK IS HERE TO SUPPORT THE VERY MUCH NEEDED OP OUTREACH AND EDUCATION THAT IS NEEDED BEFORE THAT INDIVIDUAL CHOOSES TO SUBMIT THAT APPLICATION THROUGH THE COUNTY SYSTEMS OR THE CAL HERE SYSTEM THROUGH COVER CALIFORNIA. THE WORK OF THE A SISTER IS THERE TO HELP THEM NAVIGATE THE BERIA'S -- SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE FOR OUR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE WILL COVER CALIFORNIA AND BY THAT I MEAN. THE CAL HERE'S THE CALL SALAS SYSTEMS AND IMCLONE APPLICATION PROCESS AND IN PERSON PROCESS. THAT OBVIOUS CUMBERSOME -- IN IT IT WORKS DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT AREAS COUNTIES -- ACROSS THE STATE [inaudible] THANK YOU. CAMPBELL THE PART OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- I WAS NOT A PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SO ASIDE FROM THE FISCAL -- THAT'S ALREADY BEEN MENTIONED I THINK WE WOULD JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE HAVING IF TO THE DEGREE THIS WAS INCLUDING THE FINAL BUDGET THERE ARE LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE LAST TIME. THAT WE HAD THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM I THINK THERE WERE SOME ADMINISTRATIVE COMPLEXITIES AS WELL AS I'D I DON'T THINK IN THE END WE GOT AS MANY PEOPLE TO RETAIN COVERAGE AND I THINK THAT'S LAID OUT IN THE AGENDA PRETTY WELL THAT WE WOULD HAVE HOPED. IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS AT THE END OF THE DAY AND SO CERTAINLY TO THE DEGREE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE FINAL. BUDGET WITH BETWEEN HE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE WORK WERE LEARNING FOR WHAT WE DID LAST TIME AND SEE IF WE COULD -- IMPROVE ON THOSE RESULTS IF IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE [inaudible] THANK YOU. QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I I DO WANT TO ASK -- C. C. H. I.. TO PLEASE EXPLAIN HOW YOUR PROPOSAL IS DIFFERENT. FROM OR SUPERIOR TO THE C. P. H. AND PROPOSAL. THANK YOU -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER RIGHT YES -- WE AS MERRY NOTED -- BECAUSE OF THOSE COMPLICITY SO -- THAT TOOK PLACE -- WERE REQUESTING THAT THAT IF IN FACT WE DO HAVE A MEDI CAL EXPANSION OR FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR CB ELSE. THAT EQUALS THREE THIRD PARTY ENTITY THAT CAN HELP GET THOSE FUNDED OUT TO THE CV ELVES ARE WORKING WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS DIRECTLY. THAT WILL BE THE MAIN -- DIFFERENCE THAT WE SEE. IT DOES AND DOES YOUR PROPOSAL -- INVOLVE KEEPING A PORTION OF THE FUNDS -- IF SO FOR WHAT PURPOSE FOR MINISTRATIONS TRADE. MORE THAN ANYTHING PARTNERSHIP ADMINISTRATIVELY SO THAT WE CAN KEEP TRACK AND BUT BILLS THAT WE HAVE. WHILE THE THIRD PARTY OR THE SORT OF COOL BE A MINISTRY IN THAT -- YOU KNOW I WILL THINK IT'S IT WILL BE UP TO THE THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE HERE -- BUT IT WILL BE FOR IT AND MINISTRY BILLS ONCE AND GETTING BILLS OUT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE -- IS THERE A PERCENTAGE THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE -- UTILIZE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES -- FROM THE THIRTY THOUSAND THIRTY MILLION. THIRTY THIRTY BILLION -- I YOU KNOW -- I DON'T HAVE THE PERCENTAGES IN FRONT OF ME BUT I BELIEVE -- THE CONVERSATION HAS BEEN IN THE 5% 210% AT THE MOST. ANY WILL BE MIRROR -- WITH OTHER FUNDING -- AND SORT OF OPEN FOR RECOMMENDATIONS ON THAT. AND YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES CAN SPEAK TO THAT -- TOO I DON'T KNOW IN TERMS OF WHEN THOSE MONIES WERE ALLOCATED FOR THE A. B. EIGHTY TWO HOW MUCH WAS IT THAT THE STATE KEPT. FOR YOU NOTICE READING THOSE FUNDING. GET IN IT THEN ANOTHER QUESTION IS HOW DOES. THIS METHOD. INCREASE EFFICIENCY WITH HEALTH MANAGERS. AND BY EXTENSION INCREASING ACCESS TO MEDICAL [inaudible] HELP MANAGERS. THOSE WHO ARE GOING TOWARD THE NAVIGATORS THE NAVIGATORS CAN YOU REPEAT THAT AGAIN I'M SORRY HOW HOW IS THAT YOUR PROPOSAL -- BETTER IN MAKING SURE THAT -- THAT THE NAVIGATORS CAN GET TO THE PATIENTS OR THE CONSUMERS -- BETTER CARE ESPECIALLY THROUGH ACCESS FOR MEDI CAL. YES SO -- IN. YOU KNOW WERE C. C. H. I. HAS BEEN AROUND FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS OR SO OFFICIALLY UNOFFICIALLY -- BUT YOU KNOW THE AS SISTERS THAT WORK WITH THE FAMILIES DIRECTLY OUR TRADE INDIVIDUALS THAT DO THE WORK ON THE GROUND -- IN TERMS OF GETTING THE MONEY DIRECTLY TO THEM THEY WILL IT WILL GO TO THE CBO. TO STAFF THEM AND TO SUPPORT THEM -- STEP MANY OF THIS A SISTERS ARE FUNDED BY VARIOUS STREAMS SO THEY'RE LIKE CASE MANAGERS OUT THERE WITHIN THE FAMILY SUPPORT -- FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS THE CV ELSE -- THAT ARE PROVIDING OTHER SERVICES SUCH AS CAL FRESH -- WHICH SERVICES AND AND SO ON LIKE ALL THE THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND THOSE PROGRAMS THAT. ARE ARE THERE FOR FAMILIES -- SO MANY TIMES THE HELL THAT CIS IS SISTERS ARE CARRYING MULTIPLE HATS SO IN THIS CASE IT WILL SUPPORT THAT THEY BECOME FULL TIME EMPLOYEES AND AND THAT THEY CAN HELP THEM NAPA HELP THAT FAMILIES NAVIGATE THE HEALTH INSURANCE -- PROCESS THE END. THE THE ISSUES THAT WERE DESCRIBED EARLIER THE C. P. H. AND R. THEIR SHOES THAT CAN BE RESOLVED. THROUGH THIS PROCESS OR DO YOU THINK THERE THEY ARE ISSUES THAT CANNOT BE OVERCOME AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE RECOMMENDING IT COMPLETELY -- DIFFERENT NAVIGATOR. NOT NAVIGATOR -- OR ST -- STRAIGHT DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS OR WHAT DO YOU MEAN IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS WITH THE C. P. HM. AND IF THE PROPOSAL NOW IS TO HAVE SU CHI DO IT. BECAUSE THERE WERE ISSUES WITH C. PAN. ARE THE ISSUES WE SEE PAN SO GREAT THAT THEY CANNOT BE OVERCOME OR CAN -- CAN NEW PROCESSES BE IMPLEMENTED TO REMEDY WHATEVER PROBLEMS THERE WERE THROUGH THE INITIAL -- THROUGH THE SB MANAGERIAL YES -- I THINK IN SOME COUNTIES THE SB EIGHTY TWO PROCESS WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL LOS ANGELES ORANGE COUNTY -- AND OTHERS -- IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL TO FOR COUNTIES TO A MAN THERE CUT CONTRACT THAT THEY HAD FOR OTHER SERVICES -- AND THEY WERE ABLE TO DISTRIBUTE THOSE FUNDINGS IMMEDIATELY TO CV ELSE OR ON THEIR SCHEDULE RIGHT. BUT ANOTHER COUNTY SUCH AS SOME BUT ON THE OTHER RIVERSIDE AND OTHERS SAN DIEGO YOLO COUNTY AND OTHERS -- IT WAS NOT AS SUCCESSFUL AND AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE RECOMMENDING IT AND WE DO SUPPORT THE THE CURRENT PROPOSAL BY SEA PEN. AND MATERNAL TELEHEALTH ACCESS AND COMMUNITY -- HEALTH COUNCILS BUT WE BEAT TRUTHFULLY BELIEVE THAT -- EITHER A MERGER OR A WE SEE IT AS A COMPLEMENTARY PROCESS -- BUT WE DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT SEE FEELS WILL BE. ACROSS THE STATE WILL BE SERVED BY BY GETTING ESPECIALLY IF WE HAVE A MEDI CAL EXPANSION -- JULY FIRST TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN THAT SEE FEELS WILL WILL BE.

RONALD COMING HERE ON BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL BY SEE PAN MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH ACCESS AND ALSO COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WITHOUT THE GNOMON CHAIR INCOMPETENT MY NAME IS HALEY MORALIS I'M DOOR WITH H. CHI AND I THOUGHT FROM WHAT THE WHAT I SUPPORT THESE ON THE TOOL -- PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MARIA CRUZ RCH I PROMOTE THE RECORD COUNTY. IN AS A PROMOTER OR NOT WE SUPPORT THESE BOTH ON THANKS THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS LUCY QUESTION ELLA I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH AXIS TODAY IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF THE C. PEN PROPOSAL. I'M ELATED TO HEAR SUCH STRONG CONSENSUS ABOUT THE ESSENTIAL FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE OF THIS WORK. UNDER BOTH PROPOSALS THE COMMUNITY WORKERS WHO DO THIS CRITICAL SERVICE. IT'S THE SAME THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT THAT WAY OR A CLINIC CONSORTIUM IF YOU WANT TO THINK OF IT THAT WAY OR PROMOTE THE WATER. UNDER BOTH PROPOSALS ALL OF THESE TYPES OF WAYS OF DELIVERING SERVICE IN THE COMMUNITY WOULD BE COVERED. THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO PROPOSALS AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I DO NOT SEE THEM AS COMPLEMENTARY THEY ARE DIFFERENT. THE KEY DIFFERENCE IS THAT UNDER THE C. PEN PROPOSAL THERE'S A BUILT IN STRUCTURE OF TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. UNDER THE OTHER PROPOSAL THERE'S A SUGGESTION THAT IN INTERESTED AND TO TEA RECEIVE THE FUNDS AND MAKE THE DISTRIBUTION. AND I HAVE A FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM WITH THAT I HOPE THE MEMBERS CAN ALSO SEE THAT FOR TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY WE CAN'T BE GRANTING THE FUNDS TO ONE OF THE INTERESTED ORGANIZATIONS. I ALSO WANTED TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE COMMENTS BY THE DEPARTMENT UNDER THE A. B.. EIGHTY TO PROCESS THAT WE HAD IN CALIFORNIA WHERE THESE FUNDS WERE DISTRIBUTED. A MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE MAIN COMPLEXITY FOR THE DEPARTMENT WAS THAT IT INITIALLY STARTED WITH TWO TYPES OF PROGRAMS ONE WAS GRANTS FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT WERE ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE COUNTIES. AND HAD REPORTING FROM THE COUNTIES THE OTHER WAS DIRECT THE INVOICING BY INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY WORKERS WHO WERE PROVIDING ASSISTANCE. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN SACRAMENTO AND NOT STILL APART RAPIDLY BECAUSE IT WAS JUST BEYOND THE CAPACITY. OF THE DEPARTMENT TO DEAL WITH SO I AM EAGER TO LEARN FROM THE DEPARTMENT. IF THERE WERE OTHER COMPLEXITIES THAT IT'S REFERRING TO WE WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE KNOWING THAT. OUR MAIN GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMUNITY IS SIR THAT EVERYONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS WHO'VE SPOKEN HERE TODAY GETS GOOD TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THEIR ASSOCIATION. ABOUT THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITY AND GETS TO WORK WITH THEIR COUNTY TO GET THE MONEY OUT THE DOOR IN THE RIGHT WAY -- WE WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO SEE IN THE TRAILER BILL WITH THIS MEASURE WHICH WE REALLY HOPE WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE STATE BUDGET WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE A STRENGTHENING. OF THE CORE STRUCTURE THAT WE HAD IN PLACE WITH A. B. EIGHTY TWO SO FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR A LONG TIME. TO HAVE A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS INCORPORATED SO THE DEPARTMENT CAN HEAR FROM THE COMMUNITIES ABOUT WHAT THEY NEED TO FEEL MORE SECURE ABOUT THE PROGRAM WE'D ALSO LIKE MUCH MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THEIR ASSOCIATIONS SO THEY KNOW ABOUT THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITY AND THE DEADLINES. ON ANOTHER ISSUE HERE IS THE LEGISLATION IN THE PAST GAVE SMALL COUNTIES THE OP THE OPPORTUNITY THE OPTION TO GROUP TOGETHER. AND GO THROUGH THE COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAM MORE THE SAME S. P. PROGRAM BOARD AND GET THEIR FUNDING ADMINISTERED THAT WAY FOR EFFICIENCY AND MANY GROUPS JUST DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY GETTING FUNDED. BUT IT WAS COMING THROUGH THE SAME AS PEOPLE ARE SO IN CONCLUSION I URGE MEMBERS TO THINK ABOUT TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY THE FUNDS REALLY SHOULDN'T GO TO AN INTERESTED PARTY THEY SHOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE THROUGH THE COUNTIES FOR EVERYBODY'S BENEFIT. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE NUMBER [inaudible] VERY GOOD. LET'S MOVE THANK YOU PANELISTS -- LET'S MOVE NOW TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN OKAY LET'S BEGIN WITH KRISTEN GOLDEN TESTER. I ASSEMBLY -- I'M CHRIS SINGLETON TESTER AND I WANT TO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR ALLOWING US TO PRESENT OUR PROVIDE COVERAGE ENROLLMENT PROPOSAL. AND THIS IS -- WE'RE REQUESTING THAT THE LEGISLATURE INCLUDE IN THEIR BUDGET THE CREATION OF A WICK TO MEDI CAL EXPRESS LANE PATHWAY THIS IS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S COVERAGE PROPOSAL WHICH INCLUDES THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP CHILDREN NOW. UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIA AND C. C. H. I. AS WELL AS ON MARCH OF DIMES -- SO WE ESTIMATE THAT THIS WILL BE ABOUT -- FIVE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND IN THE BUDGET YEAR. RIGHT NOW THERE'S UP ABOUT HALF OF THE TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THAT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND UNINSURED KIDS AND CHILDREN AND CALIFORNIA. ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE ALL RIGHT NOW SO REALLY THE WORK IN ON BEHALF OF COVERAGE FOR CHILDREN INVOLVES MAXIMIZING ENROLLMENT GOING TO THE PLACES WHERE THEY ARE -- ONE SMART STRATEGY THAT WE'VE COME ACROSS IS GOING TO OTHER PROGRAMS IN THE STATE WHERE ARE THESE CHILDREN ARE FINDING WHICH ONES ARE NOT ENROLLED IN MEDICAID OUT AND ROLLED ENROLLING LARGE NUMBERS OF THEM THERE -- FOR EXAMPLE THE WICK PROGRAM WHICH IS A NUTRITIONAL PROGRAM FOR PREGNANT MOTHERS INFANTS AND CHILDREN -- HAS RIGHT NOW ABOUT NINETY THOUSAND OR AND THE MOST RECENT DATA WE GOT WAS EIGHTY FOUR THOUSAND CHILDREN THAT ARE RIGHT NOW ON WAY BACK THAT ARE NOT ROLLED IN MEDI CAL. BUT BECAUSE OF THE ELIGIBILITY RULES EVERYONE OF THEM SHOULD BE ENROLLED SIMILARLY THERE'S ABOUT ELEVEN THOUSAND PREGNANT WOMEN ON THE WICK PROGRAM THAT ARE NOT ENROLLED. IN MEDICAID I'LL AND AGAIN THEY'RE ALL ELIGIBLE. SO -- THAT'S KIND OF CONCERNING AS YOU CAN IMAGINE BECAUSE THE STATE WE KNOW -- THE NAMES AND CONTACT INFORMATION OF ALL OF THESE THOUSANDS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN THAT ARE ELIGIBLE BUT NOT ENROLLED BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THERE'S A REALLY SMART STRATEGY THAT WE COULD UTILIZE TO ENROLL THEM QUICKLY. USING THE INFORMATION THAT'S ALREADY BEEN COLLECTED FROM WORK THIS IS CALLED A OF FEDERAL MEDICAID LAW -- CALLED EXPRESS LANE ELIGIBILITY HOW THAT WORKS IS THAT -- THE WICK INFORMATION CAN BE USED AS FINDINGS FOR MEDI CAL SO MEDI CAL DOESN'T NEED TO RE ASK THESE QUESTIONS AS A NEED TO RECALCULATE IN COMICS THAT ARE A WE CAN USE THAT INFORMATION ALREADY COLLECTED FROM WAY BACK. TO START A MEDICAID APPLICATION AND EXPRESS AND ROLL THEM. JUST QUICKLY ON THE BUDGET NUMBERS WE ESTIMATED FIVE MILLION -- ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT ARE A LOT OF THE FIRST YEAR WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH SYSTEM MODIFICATIONS OF WHICH THERE'S A NINETY TEN MATCH IN MEDICAID THIS IS A MEDICAID. ENROLLMENT SYSTEM SO MEDICAID WOULD COVER ALL OF THOSE COSTS -- OTHER NINETY TEN MATCH -- AND THEN IN WHEN IT'S IMPLEMENTED LET'S SAY IT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN THE FINAL QUARTER OF THE BUDGET YEAR THAT WOULD BE COVERAGE FOR THOSE CHILDREN THAT OTHERWISE WERE NOT ENROLLED OF COURSE ALL OF THEM ARE ELIGIBLE THEY JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ROLLED. AND THEN IN THE NEXT YEAR THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH IT WOULD BE THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COVERAGE OF THOSE CHILDREN. NOW AGAIN -- THIS IS A COMMITMENT THAT THE STATE HAS ALREADY MADE ON THIS BEHALF SO WE'VE REALLY ALREADY INVESTED IN COVERING CHILDREN THIS IS JUST A MATTER OF FOR FILLING THAT PROMISE AND CLEARLY THE GOVERNOR'S INTENT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT -- THESE CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR ARE GETTING EARLY ACCESS TO CARE WHEN THEY'RE INFANTS AND SO GOING TO WHERE THEY ARE MAKES A LOT OF SENSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. AMERICAN ALL THE PART OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WILL DEFER TO MY DEPARTMENT FINANCE COLLEAGUES ON ANY FISCAL ESTIMATES THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD HAVE -- FROM AN OPERATIONAL STANDPOINT THERE WOULD BE SYSTEM CHANGES AND THINGS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE MADE -- GIVEN THAT THE DATA STREAMS RIGHT NOW ARE NOT ACTUALLY CONNECTED BUT CERTAINLY THOSE ARE THINGS THAT COULD BE WORKS THROUGH WHETHER THOSE COSTS ADMINISTRATIVELY WE HAVE NOT COSTS ABOUT THAT AMOUNT SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT EXACT COST BUT THEN. DEFERRED TO MISSILE FOR ANY OTHER FISCAL. LORI L. AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BASED ON THIS PROPOSAL LAST YEAR THE ESTIMATED GENERAL FUND COSTS FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION WERE BETWEEN. TEN TO TWENTY MILLION GENERAL FUND -- INCREASING TO UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION GENERAL FUND THAT FULL IMPLEMENTATION AND IN ADDITION TO THESE FISCAL CONCERNS ALL THE FOR TO MY COUNTERPART FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO SPEAK. TO SOME IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS [inaudible] THANK YOU. WE ARE ALMOST APARTMENT A FINANCE SO FOR THE SIMILAR PROPOSAL IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THAT OUR PUBLIC HEALTH HAD ESTIMATED APPROXIMATELY. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND GENERAL FUND TO MAKE SOME CHANGES TO AN EXISTING WICK PROGRAM. EXISTING WICKS SYSTEM AT APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION GENERAL FUND TO MAKE CHANGES TO A NEW WORK SYSTEM WE NOTE THAT -- BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF THIS PROPOSAL THAT WOULD ONLY MEAN NEED TO BEING CHANGES MADE TO THE NEW SYSTEM NOT THE EXISTING. SYSTEM AS WAS LAST YEAR -- WE DO WANT TO NOTE SOME TIMING CHALLENGES ON AS A LEGISLATURE ABOUT WITH THIS PROPOSAL -- WE WOULD ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER INAPPROPRIATE IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE. THE CURRENT PROPOSAL REQUIRES AN IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE OF APRIL TWENTY TWENTY WHICH WE NEED MEAN THAT WE WOULD NEED TO MAKE SYSTEM MODIFICATIONS IN THE BUDGET YEAR THAT COULD POTENTIALLY JEOPARDIZE PUBLIC HEALTH'S FEDERALLY MANDATED IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE FOR THEN YOU WAKE SYSTEM. IF THE SYSTEM FAILS TO ME IT'S IMPLEMENTATION DEADLINE THE US DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE COULD IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES ON THE STATE. OF THE TIMELINE SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER THE NEED FOR YOU AS THE A APPROVAL OF THE MODIFICATIONS OF THE NEW WORK SYSTEM. AND FOR PUBLIC HEALTH TO AMENDED ITS EXISTING VENDOR CONTRACT WE NOTE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. MAY REQUIRE INFORMATION RECIPROCITY BETWEEN THE MEDICAL SYSTEM IN THE WAKE SYSTEM. TO INCREASE WHICH PENETRATION FOR ELIGIBLE BUT NOT AND ROLLED PARTICIPANTS OF THE CURRENT PROPOSAL DOES NOT INCLUDE INFORMATION RECIPROCITY THANK YOU. CAN I RESPOND SOME OF I'M SORRY COULD I RESPOND TO SOME OF THE FISHER CAM -- ON ON THE THE ESTIMATES -- THAT ONE I THINK IN THAT -- PART OF FINANCE ESTIMATE FROM LAST YEAR THE THE NOW THIS IS FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAID THAT THAT WAS AN OVER ESTIMATE. AND IT EITHER KIND OF SHOWS IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS OF ENROLLMENT THAT THAT'S BASED ON IT SHOWS THAT WE'RE EITHER WILDLY SUCCESSFUL IN AND ROLLING MORE CHILDREN THAT WE ESTIMATE ARE. IN FACT UNINSURED OR WE'VE IDENTIFIED AND OR WE'VE IDENTIFIED A BIGGER PROBLEM THAT MORE CHILDREN ARE UNINSURED AND NOT ENROLLED AT NEED TO BE ENROLLED SO IT. I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE IT IS BUT I IF THERE IS A BIGGER PROBLEM AND THERE'S THAT MANY UNINSURED. THEN WE HAVE A BIGGER PROBLEM AND THIS IS A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN WE THOUGHT -- ON THE ON THE WEAK SIDE WE ARE -- TALKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT THE TIME LINE AND ON THIS IS ALSO A BILL AB-- FIVE TWENTY SIX PETRA NORRIS AND SO ON THE AUTHOR IS TALKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE US THE TIME LINE THAT WOULD BE FEASIBLE BASED ON THEIR THEIR ROLL OUT OF THEIR EXISTING SYSTEM CHANGES [inaudible] THANK YOU. I BEN JOHNSON [inaudible] VERY GOOD. DID YOU WANT TO ADD SOMETHING OKAY. ALL RIGHT TO QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ALL RIGHT LET'S HEAR PUBLIC COMMENT THEM. HELLO THOUSAND IS FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND OF CALIFORNIA AND STRONG SUPPORT WERE ACTUALLY ALMA A CO SPONSOR OF LEGISLATION AND WE THINK IT IS -- TERRIFIC WAY TO IDENTIFY CHILDREN WHO ARE ALREADY ELIGIBLE -- BUT AN INSURED AND THIS IS GOING TO HELP -- ALL THE CHILDREN THAT WE CAN REACH AND THEIR AND THEIR FAMILIES THANK YOU.

HOWEVER ADULTS OVER AGE SIXTY FIVE IN MANY PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES ARE STILL SUBJECT TO THE OLD PROGRAM RULES. RULES THAT ARE BASED ON SSI ELIGIBILITY RULES. BY SIMPLIFYING THE INCOME DETERMINATION AND ELIMINATING THE ASSETS TEST COUNTIES ARE ABLE TO ADMINISTRATIVELY VERIFY ELIGIBILITY IT RE DETERMINATION FOR MANY RECIPIENTS UNDER THE NEW RULES BUT VERY FEW UNDER THE OLD RULES. FOR EXAMPLE IN SEPTEMBER THE MOST RECENT MONTH FOR WHICH WE HAVE DATA. LA COUNTY ADMINISTRATIVELY VERIFIED AT RENEWAL ALMOST A HUNDRED THOUSAND CASES USING THE NEW RULES BUT NO CASES OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE PROGRAM SERVING ADULTS OVER AGE SIXTY FIVE AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. PRECISELY THOSE WERE MORE LIKELY TO LIVE ON A FIXED INCOME CREATION WE COULD DO A LOT MORE TO ALIGN THESE TWO SIDES OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM [inaudible] HOWEVER. ABSENT THAT COOPERATION. THERE ARE STILL THINGS THAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO AS AUTHORIZED BY FEDERAL STATUTE ONE OF THEM AS YOU HEARD EARLIER IS RAISING THE INCOME TEST FOR OUR AT PEOPLE ON THE A AND D. PROGRAM. ANOTHER WOULD BE ELIMINATING A RAISING THE ASSETS LIMIT. AS WELL AS SIMPLIFYING THE RULES USED TO DETERMINE ASSETS. FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THAT STATES HAVE AN ASSET LIMIT THAT IT'S NO MORE RESTRICTIVE THAN THE LIMIT FOR SSI. FEDERAL GUIDANCE FROM CMS HAS CLARIFIED THAT THE NO MORE RESTRICTIVE TEST INCLUDES ELIMINATING ASSETS CONSIDERATIONS FOR SUMMER ALL OF THE PROGRAM'S COMPLETELY. WHAT CALIFORNIA HAS ADDED SOME EXCLUSIONS TO ITS ASSET LIMIT? AT THE OVERALL CAP JUST LIKE THE OVERALL. FEDERAL ASSET CAP FOR FED FOR SSI HAS REMOVED MADE AT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL OR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A COUPLE SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THE CURRENT ASSET LIMIT PREVENT SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES FROM HAVING ADEQUATE RESOURCES OR WHETHER CRISIS SUCH AS AN EVICTION A LEAKING ROOF OR MAJOR VEHICLE REPAIR. THE INEQUITIES BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM ARE HIGHLIGHTED AS MANY PEOPLE ARE NOW AGING INTO THIS PART OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. ONE OF OUR PARTNERS REPORTED HELPING A WOMAN WHO LOST HER MEDI CAL WHEN SHE TURNED SIXTY FIVE BECAUSE SHE HAD AMASSED A SMALL AMOUNT OF SAVINGS TO PAY FOR TERMINALLY ILL HUSBANDS FUNERAL THAT SHE WAS UNWILLING TO GIVE UP. SURE REMAIN OFF MEDI CAL UNTIL SHE ACTUALLY SPENDS THAT MONEY. OTHER PART ANOTHER PARTNER REPORTS HELPING AN ELDERLY INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS EVICTED TO OBTAIN A RELOCATION FEE TO FIND A NEW APARTMENT. BUT BECAUSE HE WAS NOT ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY FIND A NEW PLACE HE HAD TO SPEND DOWN THE RELOCATION MONEY IN ORDER TO KEEP IS MEDI CAL. BECAUSE THE COST OF HEALTH CARE SO HIGH AND LOW INCOME SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES HAVE SO FEW ASSETS TO BEGIN WITH WHEN FACED WITH A MEDIC WITH THE OUTDATED MEDI CAL ASSET RULES. PEOPLE SIMPLY SPEND DOWN THEIR ASSETS OFTEN ON HEALTH CARE UNTIL THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE. THIS PUTS THEM AT RISK OF FURTHER INSTABILITY ARE HOMELESSNESS WHEN FINANCIAL CRISES HAPPEN. FURTHERMORE THESE RULES ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY PUNISHED SENIORS OF COLOR BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE CASH STATE SAVINGS INSTEAD OF AN EXEMPT HOME. FOR EXAMPLE A LOW INCOME SENIOR WHO OWNS OUT RIGHT AN EXPENSIVE HOME IN THE BAY AREA CAN QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL. BUT A RENTER WITH THE SAME INCOME WOULD NOT GET MEDI CAL IF THEY HAD TWO THOUSAND AND ONE DOLLARS IN THE BANK. SYDNEY SIGNIFICANTLY RAISING THE MEDI CAL ASSET LIMIT WILL INCREASE FINANCIAL STABILITY SO SENIORS CAN SAVE FOR CRISIS AND DECREASE RACIAL INEQUALITY SAID SENIORS OF COLOR ARE PUNISHED FOR RACIAL DISPARITIES IN HOMEOWNERSHIP. ACCORDING TO A TWO HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN STUDY BY THE BY THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION. TWELVE STATES PLUS WASHINGTON DC RAISE THEIR ASSETS TEST AND SOME DID SO SIGNIFICANTLY IN SUMMER ALL OF THEIR MEDICAID PROGRAM SERVING SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. ARIZONA ELIMINATE AS ITS ASSETS TEST COMPLETELY TO SIMPLIFY ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS AFTER FINDING ADMINISTRATIVE SAVINGS LARGELY OFFSET BY ANY INCREASE ENROLLMENT. WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING THREE CHANGES WOULD DRASTICALLY DECREASE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THE MEDICARE ASSETS TEST. FIRST WE SHOULD INCREASE THE OVERALL CAP ON ASSET SO PEOPLE CAN SAVE MONEY FOR EMERGENCIES AND INDEX IT SO IT GOES UP EVERY YEAR. SECOND SIMPLIFY THE EXISTING ASSETS EXCLUSIONS TO DECREASE THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN OF RENEWING MEDI CAL EVERY YEAR. MANY PEOPLE SUBJECT TO THE ASSETS TEST HAVE TO GET CONSIDERABLE HELP INTERPRETING FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS OR OBTAIN ASSESSMENTS ON LOW VALUE PROPERTIES IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR MEDI CAL. WE THINK LARGER CATEGORIES OF ASSETS CAN BE EXCLUDED ENTIRELY. AND THIRD ELIMINATE THE ACID TEST ASK. ASSETS TEST FOR THE MEDICARE SAVINGS PROGRAM. THESE ARE PROGRAMS OR MEDI CAL JUST PAYS FOR THE MEDICARE COSTS RATHER THAN AND ROLLING THE INDIVIDUAL AND MEDIC HOUSE. SEVEN STATES PLUS DC HAVE GONE THIS ROUTE FOR SUMMER ALL OF THEIR MEDICAL SAVINGS PROGRAMS. BECAUSE THE STATE IS NOT ON THE HOOK FOR SOME OF THE MOST COSTLY EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH END OF LIFE CARE FOR THESE PROGRAMS. IT COULD BE AN IMPORTANT TESTING GROUND FOR A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS AS WHETHER AN ASSET TEST CONTINUES TO MAKE SENSE AT ALL. WE SHOULD NOT AS A STATE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROMOTE THE VALUE OF SAVINGS WHILE PUNISHING THOSE WHO ATTEMPT TO SAVE BY TAKING AWAY THE ONLY HEALTH CARE THEY CAN AFFORD [inaudible] Q. [inaudible] THANK YOU. CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE SERVICES SO OBVIOUSLY NOT A PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS NO SPECIFIC -- POSITION ON IT I WOULD SAY FROM AN IMPLEMENTATION STANDPOINT WE CERTAINLY AGREE THAT THERE ARE FEDERAL AVENUES THAT WOULD PERMIT SOME OF THESE CHANGES WHETHER TO THIS DEGREE YOUR HOW MUCH I THINK. THE DEPARTMENT HAS NOT HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE EN MASSE -- THERE IS I WOULD SAY SOME SUBJECTIVITY ON THE CMS SIDE AS TO WHAT THEY COULD APPROVE AND SO WE WOULD HAVE TO WORK THROUGH THOSE AND AGAIN WE HAVE NOT HAD ANY OF THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT IN ADDITION THAT OBVIOUSLY THERE WOULD BE FISCAL COST FROM HAVING ADDITIONAL. PEOPLE ON THE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE NOT HAD A FISCAL ANNOUNCES OF THAT DONE AT THIS POINT. QUESTIONS COME. TO THIS IS JUST GOING BY WHAT WHAT WAS THE ORIGINAL LOGIC WITH THAT. ASSET TESTING YOUR OPINION. AT THAT TIME ALL PUBLIC PROGRAMS HAD AN ACID TEST -- MORE RECENTLY WE GOT RID OF THE ACID TEST FOR MOST OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM -- IN ADDITION FOR OUR FOOD STAMPS PROGRAM CAO FRESH WE FUNCTIONALLY HAVE GOTTEN RID OF THE ASSETS TEST FOR ANYONE BELOW LEVEL -- THE LOGIC AT THAT TIME THOUGH WAS JUST MUCH MORE PUNITIVE ON WHO WAS ELIGIBLE FOR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND THE IDEA WAS THAT YOU NEVER WANTED ANYBODY WITH ANY SORT OF MEANS GETTING FOR THAT PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. WHEREAS NOW WE'VE MOVED TO LOOKING AT PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AS A WAY TO HELPING FAMILIES STABILIZE AT TO HELPING PEOPLE ACTUALLY SUSTAIN THEMSELVES. I I ALWAYS SAID IF WE KIND OF SAID WE HAD AN ASSET TESTING FOR PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO PUT MONEY INTO A FIVE TWENTY NINE THE COUNTER PEOPLE WANT TO SAVE MONEY TO AN IRA I MEAN. YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE ANYBODY DOING THOSE THINGS BECAUSE IT'S SO SO DRACONIAN TO NOT ONLY HAVE THE TO DO AN ACID TEST BUT ALSO ALL THE PAPERWORK YOU HAVE TO FILL OUT SO. ON THIS SAME SORT OF LONG OVERDUE IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN ORDER TO STREAMLINE STREAMLINE IT I THINK THERE ARE -- REASONABLE CONCERNS ABOUT THE FISCAL FISCAL SITUATION BUT HAVING SAYS GIVING THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE EXTRAORDINARY HIGH LEVELS OF POVERTY IN OUR STATE. KNOWING THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT IF THEY'RE NOT ON THAT ACCOUNT MAYBE THEY'RE DOING OTHER THINGS LIKE GOING INTO THE EMERGENCY ROOM OR THEY'RE NOT. THEY'RE NOT OUT COOLEY TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES WE HAVE TO PICK UP THE COST SOMEWHERE ELSE IT SEEMS LIKE. ON WALL THAT MIGHT. BE AN INCREASE IN COST OF MEDICAL AYE IT'S PROBABLY BETTER FOR THE OVERALL HEALTH. HEALTH OF THE STATE. MY ONE QUESTION WAS DO YOU DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE PROPOSAL AND MISS CAREERS BUILD THE TEN THOUSAND FIVE DOLLARS IT'S REALLY HIGH ENOUGH GIVEN THE HUGE COST OF LIVING. IN THE STATE YOU KNOW LIKE TEN pYOU KNOW I MEAN A GOOD CHUNK OF THAT COULD EVEN BE FIRST AND LAST MONTH'S RENT DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU WORKED WHICH PART OF THE STATE YOU'RE RENTING IT. WE WOULD LIKE TO LEMONADE ENTIRELY. IF I'M HONEST -- WITH WHICH YOU CAN'T DO BUT THE QUESTIONS ARE JUST CURIOUS WHY YOU CHOSE THIS TWO NUMBERS WELL EITHER. TAKING IN CONSIDERATION WITH THE OTHER PIECES OF THE PROPOSAL THAT ARE EXCLUDING BROAD CATEGORIES RETIRE EARLY -- SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU BROUGHT UP RETIREMENT RIGHT NOW RETIREMENT IS OFTEN EXCLUDED BUT IT DEPENDS IF YOU'RE TAKING THE DISBURSEMENTS AND A LOT OF OUR LOW INCOME CONSUMERS ARE HESITANT TO TAKE DISBURSEMENTS WHEN THEY HAVE A VERY TINY. RETIREMENT BUCKET TO BEGIN WITH SO WE PROPOSE EXCLUDING ENTIRELY AND THERE ARE OTHER THINGS LIKE LIFE INSURANCE POLICIESWE PROPOSE ENTIRELY -- BUT WE WOULD NOT BE OPPOSED TO ANY PROPOSAL THAT RAISES IT EVEN FURTHER. GREAT THANK YOU I MAKE IT JUST IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IF WE ACTUALLY -- WANT BETTER PUBLIC HEALTH WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE INSURED AND AND THIS SEEMS TO HAVE COUNTER INTUITIVE TO KEEP THEM. KEEP THEM OFF MEDI CAL AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS FOR THE YOU KNOW I MEAN I AGAIN I THINK -- OBVIOUSLY AT THE END THE DAY AT THE DECISION THAT WOULD NEED TO BE MADE AS PART OF THE BUDGET I THINK WHERE I JUST COME IN AT THE CAUTION IS. HOW WHAT THE A MESSAGE RESPONSE WOULD BE ON WHAT'S REASONABLE AND HOW DO WE DEMONSTRATE WHAT'S APPROPRIATE AND SO THAT'S JUST WHERE WE HAVE NOT HAD THAT CONVERSATION SO I? I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHETHER CMOS WOULD BE FINE WITH THIS OR SOMETHING HIGHER SOMETHING LOWER I THINK YOU KNOW THEY'RE PROBABLY ONLY A COUPLE FEET THAT HAVE. AROUND THESE TYPES OF LEVELS -- NEW YORK BEING ONE OF THEM -- THAT IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THAT WHAT'S PROPOSED IN THE BILL BUT IT MOST STATES ARE AROUND OUR LEVEL SO IT'S JUST THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WHAT SUBJECTIVITY THEY HAVE AN APPROVING SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IN IN THEIR ONLY RESTRICTIONS AT THAT WE HAVE A LIMIT THEY DID THEY DO THEY HAVE SAID AFTER PROVE OUR LIMIT AB SURVEY DO SO ANY CHANGE IN OUR PROPOSED ASSET LIMITS IN ANY EXEMPTIONS ARE ALL REQUIRED TO GO THROUGH A FEDERAL APPROVAL PROCESS. THAT WAS BEFORE. ALWAYS FIND. OKAY. I I I THINK THAT WE WHATEVER WE COULD DO TO I THINK SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS IT WOULD BE GOOD -- TO GET FROM FINANCE SOME ESTIMATES OF COSTS EVEN WITH THIS AYE AYE SOMEONE TO GO TO THIS BILL YOU START TO GET SOME. THAT'S NO COST BUT WOULD BE GOOD SO THAT WE CAN REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT OF SARS FINANCE COMING UP. MY GOD GOOD. NOT GONNA SPEAK FOR FINANCE. YES. THANK YOU -- BUT I'M CHAIR MEMBERS SO GIVEN YOU KNOW OUR LIMITED RESOURCES AND MAYOR VISION A WORKLOAD WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF ON A PARTICIPATION APPROACH ON ON TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THANK YOU. ON THE ESTIMATES I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE AN ESTIMATE TO PUT ON THE TABLE EITHER BUT OUR AREAS OF WORKING WITH CLIENTS WHEN WE TELL THEM THEY CAN HAVE MEDI CAL OR THEY CAN HAVE -- AMOUNT OF ASSETS OVER THE LIMIT. THEY GET RID OF THOSE ASSETS AND GO ON MEDI CAL -- IT'S JUST NORMAL LOW INCOME PEOPLE CAN AFFORD HEALTHCARE YEAH AND AGAIN THAT WHICH IS WHICH IS LIKE A HORRIBLE DECISION. BECAUSE IT MEANS THAT THEY ARE PUTTING. THEIR FAMILIES AT MUCH GREATER RISK RIGHT IT'S NOT THAT'S NOT THE BEHAVIOR WERE. WE WALKED RIGHT WE'RE NOT SAYING DON'T DON'T HAVE A CAR WHEN I THINK DON'T PICTURE CARD DON'T DON'T. DON'T WHATEVER RIGHT IT JUST THAT THAT DOES MAKE A SENSE. OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BUT IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR FINANCED OF IF YOU COULD. HELP US THINK THROUGH WHAT WHAT A WHAT A NUMBER OF MIGHT BE THAT BE GREAT. THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER JUST ONE QUESTION WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE FEDERAL PROCESS FOR APPROVAL HOW LONG IS THAT [inaudible] SORRY. LAUGHED OUT LOUD. IT CAN VERY SO JUST SO YOU UNDERSTAND OUR PROCESS SO ONCE WE SUBMIT A PROPOSED STATE PLAN AMENDMENT TO CMS THEY HAVE NINETY DAYS. TO RESPOND WITH EITHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS WHICH I IN MY EXPERIENCE 95% OF THE TIME THEY HAVE QUESTIONS -- ONCE THEY SEND THOSE QUESTIONS THE CLOCK STOPS. AND WE HAVE TO RESPOND TO THEM -- ONCE WE ARE ABLE TO SUBMIT THAT THE AGAIN HAVE NINETY DAYS SO IT WE HAVE STATE PLANS THAT CAN BE APPROVED IN THE NINETY DAY TIME PERIOD AND WE HAVE STATE PLANE AMENDMENTS. DATING BACK. TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN SO I SO SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THREE MONTHS AND THREE YEARS. SO GOOD ESTIMATE FOR IT. IT REALLY HAS TO DO WITH SORT OF THE FEDERAL PROCESS AND HOW -- BOTH WHAT WHAT ARE THE EFFORTS REQUIRED ON OUR SIDE BUT REALLY SORT OF WHAT'S THE EFFORT ON THE FEDERAL SIDE AND IF THEY HAVE A LOT OF CONCERNS OR ISSUES TYPICALLY THE DOING ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS IS A IS A METHOD FOR DELAYING THE IMPLEMENTATION. DO YOU GENERALLY SEE THE QUESTIONS A COME BACK OR A MATTER OF JUST TRYING TO BE RELEVANT OR ARE THEY ACTUALLY AFFECT FACTUAL QUESTIONS FOR ME OR THEY JUST WANT TO PROLONG. THE BUREAUCRACY BECAUSE I MEAN THIS IS THIS IS AFFECTING PEOPLE'S LIVES. BUT AGAIN I WOULD SAY IT VARIES I THINK IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE ISSUE -- AND HAVING NOT PERSONALLY GONE THROUGH A STATE PLAN PROCESS WITH RESPECT TO ASSETS UP MYSELF I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S VIEWPOINT IS OR WHETHER. THE PROCESS WOULD BE COMPLICATED OR NOT I THINK IT IT REALLY IS IT IS A YOU KNOW AS WITH ANYTHING IF YOU CAN DELAY A PROCESS BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THE THE OUTCOME THAT IS A YOU KNOW A TACTIC THAT SOMETIMES IS TAKEN SOMETIMES IT'S JUST THAT IT'S COMPLICATED -- AND EVEN ON THE FEDERAL SIDE REGARDLESS OF THE PROGRAM STAFF JUST LIKE HERE YOU KNOW WHEN OUR STATE OUR DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES STAFF -- THAN THERE ARE THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO GO THROUGH THEIR LEGAL COUNSEL AND THERE AND BUDGET IMPACT AND STUFF LIKE THAT THAT I THINK CAN DELAY THE PROCESS JUST BECAUSE OF DEPENDS ON WHAT LAYER OF LIKE APPROVAL HAS TO GO THROUGH WHETHER IT'S SORT OF MORE. STANDARD OR UP THROUGH THE HIGHER LEVEL SO IT IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY JUST BECAUSE IT IS IT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE AT LEAST I HAVE NOT DONE. IN MY EXPERIENCE IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS AND SO I JUST I CAN'T SAY WHETHER IT WOULD BE SOMETHING EASIER HARDER IN BETWEEN. ALL I CAN SAY IS APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE. THANK YOU. SO DEPARTMENT FINANCE THEN YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH -- CHAIR TING STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THAT INFORMATION. YES I'LL BE WORKING WITH THEM. MISS MARGOLIS ON THAT. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT PUBLIC COMMENT -- MADAM CHAIR AND MISTER CHAIR I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT WHEN THE ASSET TEST WAS PUT IN PLACE GEORGE DEUKMEJIAN WAS GOVERNOR -- WHICH TELLS YOU HOW LONG IT'S BEEN IN PLACE AND ON CHANGED AND I CAN'T QUITE PULL UP ON MY CELL PHONE OUT HOW MUCH INFLATION WE'VE HADN'T HEALTHCARE IN THOSE YEARS. BUT IT'S BEEN A LOT HUNDREDS OF PERCENT AND SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL AND PARTICULARLY THE REQUIREMENT THAT IT AUTOMATICALLY ESCALATE OVER TIME THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. RAINY X. CALIFORNIA DISABILITY RIGHTS THIS. AND MYSELF THIS ACTUALLY AFFECTS ME BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS EVERY TIME WE DO A MEDICARE RENEWAL WE HAVE TO FILL OUT THE FORM. AND EVERY TIME TO FILL OUT THAT FORM YOU HAVE TO MENTION EVERY BIT OF CASH CHECK MONEY ANYTHING YOU GET SO WHEN THEY FILL A NEW GUY TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HAVE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN THE BANK TO BEGIN WITH. BUT YOU CAN HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF ASSETS EITHER SO PEOPLE CAN'T BE GIVING YOU MONEY. BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO ROUTE DECLARE IT YOU CAN'T BE WINNING MONEY YOU HAVE TO DECLARE IT. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS IF YOU GO OVER THE AMOUNT YOU'LL GET A LETTER FROM. CMS THIS IS NOW YOUR SHARE OF COSTS HIS DEATH. AND THAT IS THERE SHE'S RIGHT MORE PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO EITHER A QUIT THEIR JOB. OR SELL OUT THEIR ASSETS OR GIVE EVERYTHING AWAY JUST SO THEY CAN HAVE MEDICAL COVERAGE AND AS BETH CAPELL. HEALTHCARE COSTS HAVE GONE UP AND AM NOT PASTE UP DID WITH THE HOW MUCH YOUR ACID TEST IS SO AS A PERSON WHO KNOWS THIS. AND I HAVE TO FILL THAT FORM EVER QUARTERLY. I CAN TELL YOU WE NEED DESKS. THANK YOU. KURT CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WHERE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. ON A HASSELBLAD WITH UNITED WAYS WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT -- AND YOU KNOW I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALLY THINK ABOUT IN OUR WORK IN COMMUNITIES IS THE ABILITY TO TO ACTUALLY BUILD ASSETS INTO T&lt;c.cyan&gt; AND&lt;/c&gt; HEALTH COVERAGE IN CARE -- WITH FINANCIAL STABILITY -- AND ENDED INDEPENDENCE -- AS WE BELIEVE THIS PROPOSAL HELPS GET AT THAT AND TAKES CARE OF SOME -- UNNECESSARY COMPLICATIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU. REBECCA GONZALEZ NE SW CALIFORNIA ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. ELIZABETH HAS BEEN -- SOME BEHALF OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT SEASON COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI MICHELLE CABINET I WITH SCA YOU CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. HI SEAN OFTEN WITH MOLINA HEALTH CARE OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. THANK YOU. HI KELLY MAC MILLAN MY BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU AND I WANT TO THANK OUR PANELISTS -- THIS IT IS LONG OVERDUE. OF I'D LIKE TO NOW WELCOME THE TWO PANELS FOR ISSUE NUMBER. EIGHT THE FINAL ISSUE. ALL RIGHT LET'S DO PANEL. ONE LET'S BEGIN WITH JENNIFER CAM. HELLO GOOD EVENING -- SO. I THINK YOUR AGENDA DOES THAT REALLY -- NICE JOB OF LAYING OUT THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER BUT JUST FOR KIND OF A QUICK OVERVIEW THERE ARE THREE AND STREAMS OF WORK THAT ARE BEING DONE PURSUANT TO THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER -- THE FIRST -- IS UNDER WAY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES AROUND THE BOOK PURCHASE SEEN -- AND FOR FOLKS THAT ARE NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH. HOW WE AND DDS ARE VERY DIFFERENT -- I LIKE TO EXPLAIN IT IN SIMPLE TERMS AND THAT TGS PURCHASES DRUGS FOR INSTITUTIONALIZED POPULATIONS AND SO IF YOU ARE A JAIL A COUNTY JAIL OR DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS OR DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS OR ONE OF THOSE STATE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS -- YOU WORK WITH THE GS TO PURCHASE A CERTAIN KIND OF DRUG IN A CERTAIN AMOUNT THEY GO THEY NEGOTIATE THE CONTRACT BUT THEY DELIVER THE DRUG TO THAT INSTITUTIONAL FACILITY AND IT'S DISTRIBUTED TO PATIENTS ACCORDINGLY -- AS A PAYER --SO IN TERMS OF HOW MEDI CAL OPERATES WE DON'T PURCHASE DRUGS -- AS A AS A HARD AS YOU KNOW KIND OF COST IS WHAT WE DO IS WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH MANUFACTURERS -- A PATIENT WILL GET A SCRIPT FROM A PHYSICIAN THEY WILL GO TO A PHARMACY THE PHARMACY WILL FILL THE PRESCRIPTION WE REIMBURSE THE PHARMACY BOTH THE ACQUISITION COST IN THE DISPENSING FEE -- WE HAVE TWO KINDS OF REBATES THAT WE NEGOTIATE -- ONE IS A FEDERALLY MANDATED REBATE FOR ALL DRUGS BOTH FEE FOR SERVICE AND MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE. AND THEN WE AS A STATE HAVE NEGOTIATED SUPPLEMENTAL REBATE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR WITH MANUFACTURERS IN FEE FOR SERVICE AND SO ANY DRUG THAT IS SOLD -- IN A CALIFORNIA PHARMACY -- AND WE HAVEN'T SUPPLEMENTAL REBATE IN PLACE WE GET IT AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF FUNDING ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT THE MANDATED FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS ARE -- I THINK ONE OF THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECTS OF HAVING A PRESCRIPTION DRUG DISCUSSIONS IS THE THE WAY THE PRICING WORKS -- EACH PURCHASER HAS DIFFERENT APRES SAYS THAT THEY CAN NEGOTIATE -- A LOT OF THOSE ARE -- OBVIOUSLY CONFIDENTIAL AND THEN -- AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES WE GET SIGNIFICANT -- MANDATORY REBATES -- AND SOME SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES -- FOR THE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE. WHEN THE GOVERNOR I SIGNED THE% EXECUTIVE ORDER -- WE HAVE TO SEPARATE WORK STREAMS ON TOP OF WHAT THE WORK IS THAT TGS IS CURRENTLY DOING ONE OF WHICH IS AN INITIAL FIRST STEP TO CARVE OUT -- THE PHARMACY BENEFIT FROM OUR MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS AND RETURN IT AS A FEE FOR SERVICE BENEFIT. THE SECOND WORKSTREAM WAS TO LOOK ACROSS NOT ONLY OUR PROGRAM BUT ACROSS ALL PURCHASERS ALL PEERS IN CALIFORNIA. ALL PROGRAMS UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS THAT WE AS A STATE CAN USE OUR ECONOMIC LEVERAGE SO TO SPEAK TO DRIVE LOWER DRUG PRICES I THINK -- WE WOULD NOT WANT TO SAY THAT JUST GETTING -- SAVINGS AND MEDIC COW IS ENOUGH -- FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT WE ARE A VERY KIND OF UNIQUE PURCHASER BECAUSE OF OUR FEDERAL AND STATE PROTECTIONS AROUND REBATES AND MEDICAID BEST PRICE. SO THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER IS REALLY CHALLENGING US TO WORK ACROSS THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS -- TO COME UP WITH RECOMMENDATIONS TO LOWER DRUG PRICES NOT ONLY FOR OUR PROGRAM BUT FOR OTHER PURCHASERS INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS AND THE STATE AND SO THAT IS A SEPARATE -- AND DISTINCT PART OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT WERE ALSO WORKING ON FOR PURPOSES OF THE AGENDA AND THE QUESTIONS -- FOR THE CAR ABOUT -- OF THE PHARMACY BENEFIT FROM THE MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS -- THE REASONS FOR THIS ARE -- THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR THIS THE FIRST IS -- WE HAVE -- REALLY -- STRONG INTENTION OF STANDARDIZING THE MEDICAL BENEFIT ACROSS THE MANAGED CARE MARKET SO WE HAVE -- WAIVERS THAT ARE COMING DUE AND TWENTY TWENTY A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE AS A STATE PROGRAM WOULD LIKE TO DO AS IT TURNED AS IT -- TALKS ABOUT WHOLE PERSON CARE AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF INITIATIVES IT REALLY REQUIRES US TO STANDARDIZE THE BENEFIT -- IN A WAY THAT WE CAN START TO DO MORE REGIONALI STRAIGHT AND SIMPLIFY SOME OF OUR RATE SETTING. BY PULLING OUT THE PHARMACY BENEFIT AND STANDARDIZING NOT ACROSS THE MARKET THAT ACHIEVE CERTAINLY THAT GOAL -- AS IT PERTAINS DIRECTLY TO THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER -- WE ONLY RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES ON THE FEE FOR SERVICE POPULATION TODAY WHICH HAS DRAMATICALLY SHRUNK -- IN SOME CASES -- DOWN TO VERY SMALL POPULATIONS -- ELIGIBLE FOR FULL SCOPE BENEFITS A LOT OF OUR FEE FOR SERVICE POPULATION ARE THOSE THAT ARE ON RESTRICTED SCOPE -- MEDI CAL WITH ONLY ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES -- THE OTHER POPULATION THE OTHER LARGEST POPULATION FEE FOR SERVICE ARE DUAL ELIGIBLES -- I FEEL REALLY OLD WHEN I TALK ABOUT -- LOOKING BACK ON TWO THOUSAND SIX WHEN WE SAW THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MEDICARE PART D. BENEFIT AND ON A SINGLE DAY APPROXIMATELY A MILLION DUAL ELIGIBLES HAD THEIR COVERAGE CHANGE FROM OUR PHARMACY BENEFIT AS A STATE MEDICAID PROGRAM. OVER TO THE MEDICARE PART D. BENEFIT IN WHICH A LOT OF BEEN FISHERIES HAD NO UNDERSTANDING OF HOW WHICH PLAN THEY WERE IN ROLLED AND HOW DID THEIR DRUG PLAN WORK. AND SO. I'M A LOT OF OUR RESIDUAL FEE FOR SERVICE POPULATION IS REALLY NOT GENERATING THE SAME KINDS OF SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES THAT IT ONCE DID AND I THINK -- PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER IS CERTAINLY -- IN THE SHORT TERM INTERESTED IN RETURNING THAT THIRTEEN MILLION MEMBER POPULATION INTO FEE FOR SERVICE SO THAT WE CAN BE -- KIND OF GENERATING AND RECEIVING THE FULL LEVERAGE OF THOSE SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES THAT WE OTHERWISE DON'T HAVE TODAY. AND THEN LASTLY I THINK THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT DRUG PRICES ALL TOGETHER WE ARE DEPARTMENT THAT SPENDS APPROXIMATELY TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS. IN PHARMACEUTICAL COSTS A YEAR -- COMBINED ACROSS MANAGED CARE AND FEE FOR SERVICE AND CERTAINLY TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN -- EXTRICATE ADDITIONAL SAVINGS IN THAT AREA IT OBVIOUSLY HAS -- IF THOSE ARE BIG DOLLARS AND SO ANY SPUR CENTERS THAT WE CAN SAVE A CERTAINLY -- SIGNIFICANT FROM BOTH A SHORT TERM IN A LONG TERM GOAL GOING FORWARD SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS BUT THOSE ARE THOSE THE EFFORTS THAT WERE UNDER WAY WITH THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY HAS A LITTLE. AND YOU WANT TO PRESENT ALRIGHT. HI JENNY HANDLES ELIGIBILITY I'LL I'LL TAKE. ALL RIGHT [inaudible] IS -- JENNY -- WELL ABOVE THE COVER FOR DAILY YEAH HUNDRED GUESS YOU LET SOMEONE TAKE AS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO WE DO KNOW THAT THE PROPOSAL DOESN'T HAVE A FISCAL IMACT IN -- NINETEEN TWENTY DAMAGE AT THAT MINISTRATION IS WORKING ON EVALUATING THE FISCAL IMPACT WHICH WILL -- HAVE OCCUR AT A LATER TIME IN -- TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AND ALSO THAT MINISTRATION IS EVALUATING THE ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES THAT WILL BE REQUIRED -- AS PART OF UP AS PART OF THE TRANSITION -- STRICTER CAN'T DESCRIBE. VERY GOOD THANK YOU. BEN JOHNSON WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE LAST WEEK WE RELEASED A REPORT ANALYZING THE CARVE OUT OF PHARMACY SERVICES WITHIN MEDI CAL AND WE FOUND THAT -- THE CAR ABOUT WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN SAVINGS FOR THE STATE BUT OF AN UNKNOWN MAGNITUDE -- THE SAVINGS -- WE THINK OF LEND ITSELF LEND THEMSELVES TO THE LEGISLATURE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING THIS ACTION AND AND I'LL DISCUSS SOME OF THE MEANS FOR OVERSIGHT HERE AND IN JUST ONE MINUTE -- BUT A SIGNIFICANT OF THE PORTION OF THE SAVINGS WE THINK COULD COME FROM THAT THREE FORTY BE -- ELIGIBLE ENTITIES SUCH AS HOSPITALS AND CLINICS AND SO FORTH THAT ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE FEDERAL DRUG DISCOUNTS. AND THAT SOME OF THE SAVINGS COULD ALSO COME FROM THE SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES AND OTHER SORT OF REDUCE COST UNDER THE CARVE OUT -- SUCH AS REDUCE COSTS IN MANAGED CARE -- WE DO FIND THOUGH THAT THE CAR ABOUT WOULD ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON A MAJOR MEDICAL STAKEHOLDERS -- FROM FIRM A BENEFICIARY PERSPECTIVE WE BELIEVE THAT THE CARVE OUT WOULD SERVE TO STANDARDIZE THE BENEFIT -- CURRENTLY -- IF -- MEMBERS WHICH IS MANAGED CARE PLANS FOR EXAMPLE -- THEY MIGHT HAVE A LIST OF DRUGS AT DIFFERENT LIST OF DRUGS THAT ARE READILY AVAILABLE TO THEM AND AND WHILE I BELIEVE THERE ARE SOME PROTECTIONS IN PLACE FOR THEM THERE COULD BE SOME AND ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS THAT THEY WOULD. HAVE TO GO THROUGH -- THAT SAID -- WE DO RAISE SOME QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS IN THE REPORT ABOUT. WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE ON THE CARE COORDINATION ACTIVITIES THAT THAT PLANTS HAVE SUCH AS THEIR DISEASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS -- FOR PARTICULARLY HIGH NEED POPULATIONS AND SO FORTH THEY DO TRACK -- MEDICATION ADHERENCE AND SO -- WE WOULD WE DO WE DO REYES CELLS CONCERNS AN ASTON MINISTRATION TO COME UP WITH A PLAN -- TO INSURE SOME OF THOSE ACTIVITIES CAN CONTINUE OR EVEN BE IMPROVED ALSO NON CONSUMER STAKEHOLDERS WOULD LIKELY BE EFFECTIVE AFFECTED BY THE BY THE BY THE EXECUTIVE ORDER MANAGED CARE PLANS FOR WHAT FOR EXAMPLE WOULD RECEIVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FUNDING GOING FORWARD -- THOUGH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS REDUCTION IN FUNDING WOULD REFLECT THEIR REDUCE RESPONSIBILITIES RELATED TO PAYING FOR THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS UTILIZED BY THEIR MEMBERS. AND THEN -- PROVIDERS THAT PARTICIPATING THREE FORTY B. AND OTHERS COULD NOT RECEIVE LASSEN EARNINGS ON UNDER THE FEE FOR SERVICE APPROACH. THE ADMINISTRATION ASSERTS THE NO STATUTORY CHANGES ARE NEEDED -- TO AFFECT THIS CARVE OUT AND GET SAYING THAT CURRENT LAW PERMITS THE DIRECTOR OF DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- WIDE LATITUDE IN DETERMINING WHICH SERVICES ARE DELIVERED THROUGH MANAGED CARE OR DELIVERED THROUGH FEE FOR SERVICE. WE WE DON'T QUESTION -- THE AUTHORITY TO DO SO NEVER THE LESS WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS AUTHORITY IN AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PROVIDE INPUT INTO HOW PHARMACY SERVICES ARE DELIVERED GOING FORWARD -- WE BELIEVE THE DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT NEW RESOURCES -- THE STATE OPERATIONS LEVEL -- TO AT IMPLEMENT THIS CARVE OUT FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT IS LIKELY GOING TO NEED EITHER IN HOUSE OR CONTRACT STAFF -- TO COMPLETE TREATMENT AUTHORIZATION REQUESTS FOR DRUGS THAT -- ARE ARE NOT ON THE STATE'S PREFERRED DRUG LIST AND THEY'RE ALSO COULD BE SOME. IT SYSTEMS IMPROVEMENTS AND SO FORTH -- TO INSURE BETTER COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE STATE AND MANAGED CARE PLANS -- AROUND DRUG UTILIZATION INFORMATION. SO GIVEN THE THE NEED FOR THE DEPARTMENTS NEW RESEARCH SO RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE CARVE OUT THE LEGISLATURE HAS A CLEAR OPPORTUNITY THIRDS APPROVAL OR REJECTION OF THESE RESOURCES -- TO PROVIDE INPUT INTO BOTH WHETHER AND HOW THE THE THE BENEFIT IS DELIVERED AND MEDI CAL -- THE DEPARTMENT HASN'T COME AT THIS TIME -- WITH THE RESOURCE REQUEST BUT WE WOULD EXPECT ONE TO COME IN THE FUTURE. FINALLY JUST NOTE THAT MANY IMPORTANT DETAILS ON THE PROJECTED IMPACT AS WELL AS THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN OF THE CARVE OUT HAVE YET TO BE -- RELEASED AND GIVEN THAT WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE WITHHOLD APPROVAL OF THE OF ANY FUTURE RESOURCE REQUEST BY THE ADMINISTRATION UNTIL THIS KEY INFORMATION IS PROVIDED -- THIS KEY INFORMATION -- IN OUR IN OUR ANALYSIS IS AT ONE A ROBUST FISCAL ANALYSIS WHICH I OUR UNDERSTANDING IS ONE IS EXPECTED TO COME IN MAY -- THIS YEAR'S MAYOR AROUND THE TIME OF THIS YEAR'S MAY REVISION THOUGH IT IS -- FOR FOR AN OUT YEAR -- WE WOULD ALSO -- HOPE TO SEE A PLANNED UPGRADE THE STATE'S IT INFRASTRUCTURE TO ALLOW THE GREATER -- TRANSFER OF DRUG UTILIZATION AND TO MANAGED CARE PLANS TO ALLOW -- CARE COORDINATION ACTIVITIES TO CONTINUE -- GUIDANCE AIMED AT MAINTAINING OR IMPROVING BENEFICIARY CARE UNDER THE CARVE OUT SUCH AS ANY CONTINUITY OF CARE PROTECTIONS I THINK SOME STAKEHOLDERS ARE GOING TO BRING UP LATER. AS WELL AS AN ANALYSIS OF FEASIBLE ALTERNATIVES TO THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH -- THERE ARE WE DO LAY OUT A FEW -- ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES SOME OF WHICH HAVE RECEIVED CONSIDERATION -- PREVIOUS IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND THEY ALL COME WITH DIFFERENT TRADE OFFS I VIS A VIS EACH OTHER AND VIS A VIS -- THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH AND SO WOULD -- WANT -- THIS THIS -- ACTION TO BE CONSIDERED -- IN LIGHT OF THOSE ALTERNATIVES SO HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. ALL RIGHT LET'S OPEN IT. TOO OF PUBLIC COMMENT -- EXCUSE ME LET'S GO TO PANEL TO AND THEN WE'LL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER PANEL [inaudible] TO THANK YOU. WE OFFERED YOU CAN ALL STAY BUT I THINK THIS WILL SQUEEZE THANK YOU. BEGIN WITH THAT [inaudible] DOCTOR CON. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR -- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE COMMENT THIS AFTERNOON -- MY NAME IS SEYED KHANDAN THE CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR MOLINA HEALTH CARE OF CALIFORNIA -- CARE COORDINATION IS REALLY PARAMOUNT TO FUNCTIONS THAT HEALTH PLANS PERFORM IN FACT I WOULD SAY THAT. IT RISES TO THE TOP VERY QUICKLY IN TERMS OF ACTIVITIES THAT HEALTH PLANS TO IN TERMS OF BRINGING VALUE. TO PATIENTS AND MEMBERS -- A LOT OF THE CARE COORDINATION ACTIVITIES RELY HEAVILY ON DATA AND ON REAL TIME DATA AND ONE OF THOSE KEY COMPONENTS IS REAL TIME PHARMACY DATA. NOT ALL CARE COORDINATION ACTIVITIES REQUIRE REAL TIME BUT MANY OF THEM DO AND I I THINK GIVING A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES QUICK EXAMPLES MAY HELP ILLUSTRATE -- SOME OF THE DEPENDENCE ON THIS TYPE OF DATA. AND HOW -- FAIRLY NIMBLE ADJUSTMENTS TO MEDICATIONS ARE RECOMMENDED BY THE HEALTH PLAN TO THE PRESCRIBER. ONE EXAMPLE IS IN THE TREATMENT OF I ASTHMA CHILDHOOD ASTHMA WHICH IS VERY PREVALENT IN THE MEDI CAL -- ADOLESCENT IN YOUTH POPULATION -- VERY QUICKLY IT'S TREATED BY TWO INHALERS THERE'S THERE IS LONG ACTING AND SHORT ACTING INHALERS. THE LONG ACTING IS THE CONTROLLER AND BY -- FIVE MONITORING THE USAGE OF TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF MEDICATIONS THAT PLAN. CAN I UNDERSTAND WHETHER A CHILD OR WHETHER A PATIENT IS BEING COMPLIANT IS ACTUALLY TAKING THE MEDICATION FILLING THE MEDICATION NUMBER ONE BUT THEN ACTUALLY TAKING IT. AND THEN PROVIDING THAT FEEDBACK TO THE PROVIDER OR IN SOME CASES ACTUALLY MAKING INTERVENTION THEMSELVES TO REACH OUT TO THE MEMBER. AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HEY YOU'RE TAKING THE WRONG MEDICATION THE WRONG WAY IT'S A FAIRLY SIMPLE -- CHRONIC ILLNESS TO TO CONTROL THAT DOES RELY ON REAL TIME PHARMACY DATA BECAUSE FREQUENTLY MEMBERS WILL FILL THEIR THEIR MEDICATIONS MORE THAN ONCE A MONTH PARTICULARLY FOR CONTROLLER TYPE OF MEDICATION. THE OTHER EXAMPLE IS ONE IN WHICH INTERVENTION CAN BE DONE WITH REGARD -- TO EITHER COMPLEX DISEASE DOT COMPLEX MEDICATION REGIMENS OR WITH REGARD TO DANGEROUS MEDICATION REGIMEN SO THAT WAS THE CASE BOB VERY RECENTLY THAT I WAS INVOLVED IN REVIEWING. OF A PATIENT WHO WAS GETTING A PROCEDURE DONE FOR LOW BACK PAIN. AND IN PART OF THE REVIEW PROCESS IT'S OUR PROTOCOL TO REVIEW ALL THE MEDICATIONS THAT WERE FILLED -- FOR THAT MEMBER IN THIS PARTICULAR MEMBER HAPPENED TO BE TAKING AN OPIOID AND BENZODIAZEPINE WHICH IS A A GENERALLY SPEAKING A CONTRACT -- CATION THAT THEN PROMPTS US TO REACH OUT TO THE DIFFERENT PRESCRIBERS BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT PRESCRIBED BY THE SAME PRESCRIBER IN THIS CASE. AND UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WERE PRESCRIBED AND THEN MAKE INTERVENTIONS IS APPROPRIATE -- TO MINIMIZE THE RISKS OF THE REAL ISSUE WHAT THE REAL CONCERN THAT THE HEALTH PLANS HAVE IS. TIMELY ACCESS TO REAL THIS TIME PHARMACY DATA AND UTILIZING THAT INFORMATION. TO HELP. COURSE CORRECT AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO PATIENTS REGARDING THEIR CARE THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU -- JONATHAN. I AM IN PLACE OF JONATHAN MY NAME IS AB PATTERSON I AM -- WITH CALIFORNIA HELPLESS ADVOCATES YET TO STEP OUT -- SO I'VE EXCUSE ME AS I TAKE SOME OF HIS COMMENTS AS WELL AS SOME ANOTHER ONE OF OUR HEALTH CENTERS COMMENTS AND ALL READ THEM ON HIS BEHALF -- SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR PERSPECTIVE ON THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER TO CREATE A SINGLE PURCHASER SYSTEM FOR PHARMACEUTICALS IN CALIFORNIA. THE COST OF DRUGS ONE OF THE FASTEST RISING CROSS COSTS IN HEALTHCARE TODAY. HEALTH CENTERS AND OTHER SAFETY NET PROVIDERS REMAIN COMMITTED TO FINDING MORE WAYS TO LOWER THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AS THESE IN. AND TO THE AS THESE IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE WE ASK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE KEEP IN MIND. THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN SAFETY NET HOSPITALS THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE THREE FORTY B. DRUG PRICING PROGRAM FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS. I'M GONNA SHARE A LITTLE BIT -- A FROM WELL SPACE AS WELL AS WELL AS ONE COMMUNITY HEALTH -- BUT OUR COMMENTS ARE REALLY REFLECTIVE ON BEHALF OF COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS THIRTEEN HUNDRED PROVIDING CARE SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ONE IN -- SIX AS WELL AS OUR PARTNERS AT THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS IN URBAN AND RURAL CALIFORNIA -- SO WHILE SPACE THEY USE THEIR THREE FORTY B. DRUG -- ONE COMMUNITY HEALTH THREE FORTY B. DRUG DISCOUNT PROGRAM SUPPORTS THE FOLLOWING SERVICES. IN HOUSE PHARMACY -- WHICH IS STAFF TO WORK WITH INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS TO GUARANTEE ADHERENCE OFTEN COMPLEX MEDICATION REGIMENS -- THE DOCTOR CON JUST MENTIONED AND PROVIDE FREE SHIPPING AND DELIVERY. IT ALSO FUNDS. INDIGENT MEDICAL AND DENTAL CARE SUPPORT TO THE UNINSURED PATIENTS FOR PRIMARY MEDICAL DENTAL MENTAL HEALTH CARE CLINICAL PHARMACY OUT REACH CASE MANAGEMENT MENTAL HEALTH. SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT NUTRITION AND HEALTH EDUCATION SERVICES ALL -- AIM TO INTEGRATE CARE FOR BETTER PROVEN -- HEALTH OUTCOMES AND MOST OF THESE WOULD ALL HAVE TO BE SCALED BACK OR COMPLETELY ELIMINATED OF THIS PROPOSAL GOES THROUGH AND THREE FORTY BE SAVINGS ARE ELIMINATED -- AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL THREE FORTY B. CONGRESS CREATED THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO TO ENABLE THE SAFETY NET HOSPITALS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS TO SCRAP TO STRETCH. SCARCE FEDERAL RESOURCES AS FAR AS POSSIBLE REACHING MORE ELIGIBLE PATIENTS AND PROVIDING MORE COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES. IN CALIFORNIA HUNDREDS OF HEALTH CENTERS AND A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY HOSPITAL'S PARTICIPATE AND RELY ON THE THREE FORTY B. DRUG DISCOUNT PROGRAM. IN ORDER TO QUALIFY AN ORGANIZATION MUST BE CONSIDERED A COVERED ENTITY FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS -- ARE ELIGIBLE AS WELL AS HOSPITALS THAT ARE EITHER NONPROFIT OR PUBLICLY OWNED AND SERVE A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PATIENTS. THE ADMINISTRATION ARGUES THAT THE PROPOSAL LOWER THE COST OF DRUGS AND BRING MORE MONEY TO THE STATE. AND WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THE GOAL TO LOWER THE COST OF DRUGS WE WANT TO POINT OUT THOUGH THAT AND THREE FORTY BE A HELP. WE WANT TO POINT OUT THOUGH THAT THREE THOUGHT FORTY BE HEALTH CENTER PATIENTS OF WHICH THERE ARE SEVEN MILLION ARE ALREADY RECEIVING LOW TO NO COST DRUGS. AND THE SAVINGS ACCRUED FROM THREE FORTY B. R. 1100% INVESTED BACK INTO THE PATIENT CARE AND SERVICES. SHOULD THE STATE ELIMINATE OUR ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE AND THREE FORTY BE MANAGED CARE AND REQUIRE THAT DRUGS BE PURCHASED IF YOU FOR SERVICE ACTUAL ACQUISITION. WE ESTIMATE THAT AT LEAST A HUNDRED MILLION SAVINGS AND I CAN SAY THAT CONFIDENTLY AND HAVING HEARD BACK FROM 50% OF THE HEALTH CENTERS. AND IT'S ALREADY NINETY MILLION. THAT WILL BE A LOSS TO HEALTH CENTERS ALONE ACROSS THE STATE RESULTING IN A REDUCTION OF STAFF SERVICES AND HOURS OF OPERATION. LAST YEAR WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SOME OF THE RURAL HEALTH CENTER SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO CLOSE SOME OF THEIR SITES AT THREE FORTY ONE AWAY. WE WANT TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE AS THIS PROPOSALS DEVELOP TO ENSURE CALIFORNIA'S CRITICAL SAFETY NET HOSPITALS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER ESSENTIAL SERVICES THAT THEY DO TODAY. THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING A SPACE FOR THIS IMPORTANT CONVERSATION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. THAT I FELT. BETH BILL WITH HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA HERE IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT ARE WORKS OR NOT AIM. TO OUR FRIENDS IN THE COMMUNITY CLINICS OR THEIR THEIR GOOD WORK. OF INSTEAD WHAT WE'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IS HOW EFFECTIVE CALIFORNIA WAS IT MAXIMIZING DRUG SAVINGS WHEN THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM. NEGOTIATED SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES WE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST STATES IN THE NATION TO DO THAT. OVER THE YEARS WE SAVED BILLIONS AND BILLIONS NOT MILLIONS BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. BY HAVING A SUPPLEMENTAL DRUG REBATE THAT WAS NEGOTIATED ON TOP OF THE MANDATORY REBATE FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THAT THE MEDICAID PROGRAM GET THE BEST PRICE. AS WE TRANSITION TO PEOPLE INTO MANAGED CARE WE GAVE UP THOSE SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES ON THE SCIRI. THAT THE MANAGED CARE PLANS WOULD DO A BETTER JOB NEGOTIATING WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT WHAT MANAGED CARE PLANS DO IN NEGOTIATING DRUG PRICES IN THE COMMERCIAL SPACE AS A RESULT OF SB. SEVENTEEN OTHER PIECES OF LEGISLATION. AND BY AND LARGE WERE NOT VERY IMPRESSED -- WE THINK THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHE HAD A MUCH BETTER TRACK RECORD IN PART DRIVEN BY THE NEEDS OF OUR STATE BUDGET. IN ORDER TO BE THE MOST EFFICIENT WE COULD BE IN TERMS OF NEGOTIATING SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT STATE AND FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THAT THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM GIVE PEOPLE ACCESS TO MEDICALLY NECESSARY DRUGS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A PREFERRED DRUG LIST. LITERALLY. THE MEDIC CAL PROGRAM NEGOTIATED WITH DRUG MANUFACTURERS IN ORDER TO GET ADDITIONAL REBATES IN ADDITION TO THE 23% MANDATORY REBATE AND THEY ALL. ABOUT DOUBLE THAT AMOUNT THAT'S A LOT OF SAVINGS THAT GOT HANDED OFF TO THE MANAGED CARE PLANS IN THEORY IT'S REFLECTED IN THEIR RATES. WE CAN'T TELL WHAT'S ON THE MEDI CAL SIDE BUT ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE WE KNOW NOW. THEY MOST THEM. DON'T BARGAIN HARD AT LEAST AS BEST WE CAN TELL. WE HAVE A NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND HAVE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH THEM ON HOW THEY CAN BE EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THEY WERE IN THE PAST WE SUGGEST FOR EXAMPLE. THAT THEY THINK ABOUT A FORMULARY THAT'S BY CONDITIONS SO IF YOU HAVE ASTHMA THAT THEY NEGOTIATE A COUPLE OF THE INAPPROPRIATE FORMULAR A FOR THE ASTHMA DRUGS IF YOU HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. THEY HAVEN'T ACOSTA ENOUGH GENERICS IN EACH CATEGORY TO TREAT HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE BUT NOT EVERY DRUG. AND THAT THEY NEGOTIATE BUT CONDITION WE'VE ALSO SUGGESTED THAT SOMETHING THAT THE HEALTH PLANS THEMSELVES ARE REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW TO HAVE A EIGHT WHAT'S CALLED A PAEAN TO COMMITTEE OF PHARMACEUTICAL IN THERAPEUTICS COMMITTEE WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO HELP THEM WITH. THESE CLINICAL DISCUSSIONS. AND CERTAINLY PRESCRIBING INFORMATION IS SOME OF THE MOST REAL TIME INFORMATION THAT WE HAVEN'T HEALTH CARE IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN REAL TIME IT'S ALL IT'S ALMOST ALL OUR TRONIC AND HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME SO. THAT MAKES SENSE TO US AS WELL. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS PEOPLE ARE GIVEN ACCESS TO MEDICALLY NECESSARY DRUGS THAT THERE'S A PROCESS THAT INVOLVES CLINICIANS IN MAKING THAT DECISION. FOR MANAGED CARE WE HAVE THE INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW PROCESS IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR MEDI CAL WE WOULD HOPE THAT IS THIS IS DEVELOPED THERE WE COULD HAVE SOMETHING THAT INVOLVES CLINICIANS WITH THE RELEVANT EXPERTISE. SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS SALES MUST SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS LUPUS WHATEVER THE CONDITION IS THAT WE HAVE THE EXPERTISE THAT'S NECESSARY. SO YOUR ANALYSIS OF NOTES A NUMBER OF OTHERS WERE WE MADE SUGGESTIONS -- BUT THE HOURS LATE AND WE WILL. LEAVE HE WE WERE SURE YOU'VE DONE YOUR READING SO WE WERE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND ALL OF THE COMMENTS -- WERE VERY IMPORTANT I THINK ALL OF THOSE ARE GOOD SUGGESTIONS [inaudible] QUESTIONS COMMENTS [inaudible] DOCTOR WOULD. HI I'M JUST YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE HEARD I'VE HEARD FROM. MANY MANY CLINICS IN MY DISTRICT ABOUT SIX THEIR CONCERN HERE -- AND SO. ARE THERE MEETINGS HAPPENING WITH. I DIED AT TO TRY TO RESOLVE. RESOLVE THE CONCERNS. YES SO WE HAVE MET WITH THE CLINICS THE HOSPITALS THE PLANS -- I THINK IN SOME CASES IT'S BEEN ASKING QUESTIONS YOU KNOW FOR CLARITY AROUND WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER IS AND HOW WE'RE PROCEEDING -- I THINK WE HAVE CHALLENGED THE PLANS IN THE HOSPITALS AND THE CLINICS -- TO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S A PROPOSAL OR A COUNTER PROPOSAL -- THAT MEETS THE GOVERNOR'S OBJECTIVES AROUND PRICE SCENE AND GREATER TRANSPARENCY AROUND THE THREE FORTY B. -- REVENUES THAT WE WOULD BE OPEN TO SEEN THAT AND SO I THINK IN SOME CASES THERE'S AN ONGOING DIALOGUE AS IT PERTAINS TO THE DATA ISSUE WITH THE HEALTH PLANS -- WE'VE HAD BOTH GROUP DISCUSSIONS WITH THE PLANS AS WELL AS WE HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH A COUPLE. OF OUR MANAGED CARE PARTNERS THAT WE RELY PRETTY HEAVILY ON FOR TECHNICAL FEEDBACK SOMETIMES I THINK THAT WE HAVE HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR THAT DATA. AND REAL TIME DATA IS IS THE IDEAL AND WE AGREE AND SO I THINK WE INTERNALLY YOU'RE LOOKING AT OUR SYSTEMS THAT ARE CAPACITY IN CAPE CAPABILITY TO DO THAT SO. I THINK YOU KNOW WE ARE OPEN TO A DISCUSSION AS LONG AS IT IS HITTING SOME OF THE OBJECTIVES THAT WE NEED IN TERMS OF THE STATE'S PROPOSAL AROUND. GREATER SAVINGS GREATER LEVERAGE -- TO ACHIEVE SUPPLEMENTAL REBATES TO THE EXTENT THAT DRUGS REMAIN IN THE MANAGED CARE PROGRAM WE LOSE ALL OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL REBATE DISCUSSION SO THERE IS. AN ATTENUATED -- NEED TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHAT OTHER PEOPLE ARE THINKING FOR CONSIDERATION THERE. WELL I GUESS MY CONCERN IS AND THE I'VE HEARD THIS SENSE ALMOST. INSTANTLY SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE THE GOVERNOR'S PLAN AND AND I AM CONCERNED IS IS. YOU KNOW. I'M NOT AND I'M NOT IN THE BEST POSITION TO JUDGE ARE THERE IS THE POTENTIAL. FOR CLINICS TO CLOSE BECAUSE OF THIS CHANGE IN POLICY. THAT WOULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE -- AND SO I'M I'M I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING THE RESOLUTION OF THESE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE AT A TIME WHEN YOU KNOW WE WE DESPERATELY NEED -- CLINICS AND TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CARE AT THE THOUGHT THAT WE MIGHT LOSE SOME OF THEM BECAUSE OF A CHANGE IN POLICY. I'D I'D I NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER SO I WILL I WILL LOOK FORWARD -- TO RESPONSE AT SOME POINT AND I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY -- OF SUPPORTING AND BUILDING THE SAFETY NET GREAT YOU KNOW WE WE NEGOTIATE ENTIRE MEDICAID WAIVERS TO BRING IN ADDITIONAL YOU KNOW BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO SUPPORT -- OUR SAFETY NET AND SO IT'S NOT OUR INTEREST NOR OUR INTENTION TO HARM THAT WE FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE CLINICS PROVIDE THE BACKBONE OF OUR PRIMARY CARE SYSTEM IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. I THINK WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS -- SAID IS THAT IN THIS KIND OF AND IT HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A PAINFUL DISCUSSION IN TERMS OF THE REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM. IS COME TO US AND SHOW US WHAT -- THE CLINICS BOTH. I RECEIVE THE REVENUE FOR AND WHAT YOU USE IT FOR AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THE STATE COLLECTIVELY SEES. THAT IN A IN A MORE TRANSPARENT WAY IT'S A POLICY DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW THE STATE WANTS TO PRIORITIZE THOSE FUNDS AND AND THE TYPES OF SAFETY NET INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS THAT WE WANT TO COLLECTIVELY SUPPORT AND SO. I THINK THAT'S THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE WILLING TO HAVE AND SO WOULD CERTAINLY BE HAPPY TO TO WORK WITH YOU AS WELL AS OTHERS ON THAT. AND I TEND TO TALK ABOUT CLINICS -- COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS -- THAT WE ARE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A TRANSPARENCY PROPOSAL SINCE LAST YEAR -- TO AND KNOWING THAT THAT'S BEEN A TOUGH. PLACE TO TALK ABOUT AND WORKING ON IT SINCE EVERYBODY DOES A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY THE NOTES I HAVE HERE SHOW TO HEALTH CENTERS DOING A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY -- BUT WE WANT TO BE TRANSPARENT AND THE SAVINGS MEANS SO MUCH TO US AND ARE ABLE TO SUPPORT. THINGS LIKE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THINGS LIKE CARE COORDINATION ALL THE THINGS -- I THINK THE PROBABLY THE MOST EXCITING THINGS ABOUT HEALTHCARE ARE IN THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM AND SO WE DON'T WANT THEM TO GO AWAY AT ALL AND IF WE CAN BE MORE TRANSPARENT AND DELIBERATE AND CLEAR BACK TO THE STATE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING. WE'RE MORE THAN WILLING TO DO THAT. THANK YOU I I WANT TO SAY THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE GOVERNOR CAME IN AND HE KNEW THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM. DRUG PRICES ARE TOO HIGH AND WE KEEP HEARING. ESPECIALLY WITH FAMILIES AND WITH OUR SENIORS THAT THEY HAVE TO DECIDE OR DO I FEEL THE PRESCRIPTION OR DO I PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. A SITE I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT HE SAW HOW SERIOUS IT WAS AND THAT SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT IT. I TOO HAVE BEEN HEARING FROM MY COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS -- THEY ARE SOUL IMPORTANT IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND WE WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T BECOME THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE. BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE DEVASTATING TO THE COMMUNITIES -- THE TRANSPARENCY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT SO IF IF THE ADMINISTRATION IS SAYING WE WANT TO EVALUATE. BUT DON'T GIVE A SANTA DON'T ONLY INFORMATION GIVE US HARD FACTS -- THEN THE VALUATION CAN BE PROPERLY MADE -- AS OPPOSED TO YES WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE DOWN. SHOW ME THE NUMBERS SHOW ME EXACTLY WHY YOU WOULD BE CLOSING DOWN -- IF IF WE WERE TO IMPLEMENT THIS -- HOW IMPORTANT IS A THREE FORTY PROGRAM HOW MUCH MONEY IS COMING IN? AND I THINK THAT. AS OPPOSED TO DOING IT ANECDOTALLY IF WE HAVE TOTAL TRANSPARENCY THE INFORMATION IS PROVIDED. THEN THE SOMETHING THE ADMINISTRATION COULD SAY -- THAT MAKES SENSE NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU SAY YOU MAY CLOSE DOWN BUT IF THE CLINICS ARE SAYING. WE MAY HAVE TO CLOSE DOWN BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART THE REBATE TO SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART -- I CAN SEE THE PUSH BACK I CAN UNDERSTAND THE PUSH BACK SO I WOULD HOPE LIKE DOCTOR WOULD DO THAT. THE CONVERSATIONS WOULD CONTINUE. BECAUSE WHAT THE GOVERNOR DID WAS VERY BOLD AND THE WE HAVE TO WE HAVE TO GET FULL CREDIT. FOR FOR HIS COURAGE TO TO DO THAT. WE ALSO WANT TO BE SURE. AND HE WOULD BE JUST AS CONCERNED ABOUT COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS. WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT ARE A COMMUNITY CENTERS COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS DO NOT CLOSE DOWN. SO THE INFORMATION I THINK HAS TO BE PROVIDED FOR FOR FOR FOR FOR FULLY VALUATION [inaudible] ANYTHING FURTHER. NO I I AGREE I THINK -- WE ALL SHARE THE VISION OF THE GOVERNOR THE GOVERNOR'S VISION OF FINDING A WAY TO REDUCE DRUG PRICES I MEAN THAT'S SOMETHING OF TEMPERATE AND THAT'S THE DAY I GOT HERE AND YES -- AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT BECAUSE IT YOU KNOW AT AS DRUG PRICES CONTINUE TO RISE. AT THE HIGH AT FASTER THAN ANY OTHER SECTOR OF HEALTH CARE -- WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND THIS AND SO I I APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS IN AND THEY JUST. MY CONCERN IS IS IS NOT WANTING TO HAVE AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE AND AND LOSE PROVIDERS BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF THAT. SO I'M CONFIDENT THAT THERE WILL BE. EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE IT DIDN'T HAPPEN WILL YOU WILL YOU GIVE ME ONE ANECDOTE WILL YOU ALLOW ME ONE ENACTED. YES OKAY. SO -- WE HAVE I ASK QUESTIONS OF MY DEPARTMENT BECAUSE I REALLY LIKE DATA AND I ASKED A QUESTION OF MY DATA ANALYTICS PEOPLE A FEW YEARS AGO AND SAID WHAT. WHAT IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE PERSON IN MY PROGRAM RIGHT I KNOW HOW MUCH ONE PERSON THERE'S GOT TO BE ONE PERSON THAT HAS? HAS RECEIVED A LOT. AND WE HAVE ONE PERSON THAT HAS RECEIVED IN THE IN THAT YEAR -- TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THEY WERE THEY COST US TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS I HAVE FIVE PEOPLE THAT OF COST OVERTEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND YOU CAN HAVE THESE THEORETICAL CONVERSATIONS AROUND YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IS HEALTH CARE COST IN IS IT TOO MUCH AND ARE YOU DOING A BETTER JOB YOU KNOW WHY DON'T PEOPLE TAKE MORE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR COSTS YOU KNOW WHATEVER. AND WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THAT I IMMEDIATELY PUSHED BACK AND SAY BUT IF WHAT IF THAT TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLAR PERSON WITH YOUR CHILD. AND THEY SAY OH MMHM AND THEN THEY USUALLY QUIETLY WALKWAY AND DON'T ASK ME MORE QUESTIONS. WE HAVE DRUGS THAT HOURS WITHIN BEING APPROVED BY THE FDA. WE HAVE A REQUEST FROM PROVIDERS TO AUTHORIZE THAT FOR CHILDREN IN SOME CASES WE HAVE DRUGS RELATING TO MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY TRADITIONS. THAT ARE HALF A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR -- WHICH WITHIN HOURS WE HAVE REQUEST FOR AUTHORIZATION I MEAN WE DO SOME REALLY AMAZING AND INCREDIBLE THINGS I THINK WE RECOGNIZE HOW IMPORTANT -- THE AVAILABILITY AND ACCESS TO PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IS. THERE'S NO ONE ELSE THAT CAN SUPPORT A TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLAR INDIVIDUAL OTHER THAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE PROGRAM THAT WE RUN -- THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE AND AS AN EMPLOYER BASED COVERAGE ON IT WOULD CRIPPLE SOMEONE WITH AN INDIVIDUAL POLICY AND SO I THINK WE'RE EXTREMELY MINDFUL OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BENEFIT. BUT ALSO WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE USING ALL OF THE POWER OF OUR DEPARTMENT AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE STATE. ARE IN THE IN THE IN THE WORLD TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE NEGOTIATE BETTER PRICING AND SO I THINK YOU HEAR A COMMITMENT FROM US WHICH IS. WE VALUE THE BENEFIT WE SEE THE IMPORTANCE FOR INDIVIDUALS BUT WE ALSO ARE KEENLY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE MOVING TO MARKET SHARE. AND SO THAT IS THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE WANT TO WORK ON WITH BOTH THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHERS AS WE KIND OF MOVE FORWARD ON THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER. WONDERFUL THANK YOU KNOW UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES I NEED MY COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS. TAKE CARE OF EVERYBODY I THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH -- I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP. FOR A PUBLIC COMMENT NOW. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WERE NEUTRAL ON THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL BUT DO SEE IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE. FEE FOR SERVICE CARVE OUT SYSTEM AB PARTICULARLY WE'D LIKE TO SEE ANY CAR ABOUT RECOGNIZE THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION PROCESS INTERNALLY HAS UNDERGONE AND PROVIDE CONTINUITY OF CARE -- ELIMINATE THE SIX DRUGS OFF CAP -- IT ENSURE TIMELY ACCESS SIMILAR TO WHAT'S REQUIRED IN STATUTE FOR MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS. AS WELL AS I DO PROCESS RIGHTS AND ACCESS TO AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEW OR SOME EXTERNAL A PROCESS SIMILAR TO THAT -- IN ADDITION -- RECOGNIZING THE THE THE WORK -- MOVING FORWARD ON THIS ISSUE A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING JENNIFER ALLEY WITH CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH PLANS AND WE REALLY DO APPLY THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE RISING COSTS OF PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION. I'M SKYROCKETING DRUG PRICES BEEN A MAJOR ISSUE THAT IMPACT THE OVERALL COST TO HEALTH CARE -- OUR MEMBER HEALTH PLANS WHATEVER YOU HAVE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE EXECUTIVE ORDER AND HOW IT WILL IMPACT THE HEALTH PLANS ABILITY TO MANAGE AND COORDINATE CARE FOR MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES -- WE'VE YOU THE PHARMACY BENEFIT THERE'S MORE THAN JUST PURCHASING DRUGS -- HEALTH PLANS UTILIZE PRESCRIPTION DATA TO MANAGE OF THE AN OR AN UNRELEASED CHRONIC CONDITIONS AND MONITOR REFILLS FOR SPECIFIC MEDICATIONS -- IS UNCLEAR -- HOW THE SERVICES WILL BE IMPACTED BY THE CAR ABOUT AND HOW IT WILL ULTIMATELY LOWER THE COST OF CARE DRUG PRICES THANK YOU? THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS ELIZABETH ESPINOSA HERE THIS EVENING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS -- LIKE OTHERS WHO SPOKE BEFORE ME WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORT TO REDUCE OF PHARMACY COSTS AS AS I THINK -- WE ALL SHARE AS AN OBJECTIVE BUT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW SOME IMPACTS THAT ARE MEMBERS I WOULD EXPERIENCE -- AS A RESULT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE ALL PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS ARE ELIGIBLE THREE FORTY BE PROVIDERS. AND WOULD BE AFFECTED INDEED BY THE MOVE A PHARMACY TO MEDI CAL -- FEE FOR SERVICE OUR MEMBERS USE THESE DRUG DISCOUNTS TO PROVIDE BETTER ACCESS TO DRUGS FOR ALL OF OUR PATIENTS. PUBLIC HOSPITALS ALSO ADMINISTER CRITICAL CRITICAL PROGRAMS THAT PATIENTS MAY NOT FIND ELSEWHERE INCLUDING HABSI TREATMENT HEMOPHILIACS SERVICES HIV AND SPECIALTY SERVICES. FOR OTHER FORMER VULNERABLE PATIENTS SO AT AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM OTHERS BEFORE US WHO SPOKE BEFORE ME WE DO LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE ADMINISTRATION TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES -- IT TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THE THREE FORTY PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING I CHAIR AND MEMBERS MITCHELL GOT IT I WITH SCA YOU CALIFORNIA WE LIKE THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER BECAUSE WE THINK IT FORCES INDIVIDUAL STAKEHOLDERS TO REALLY STRETCH THE LIKELIHOOD OF GENERATING. SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH WE CAN THEN REINVEST TO WHERE THERE ARE LEGITIMATE AT EXTRA SERVICES BEING PROVIDED BY THE SAFETY NET TO BACK FILL AND HOLD THEM HARMLESS WE THINK WE CAN DO BOTH THINGS. AND WE AGREE THAT HEALTH PLANS DO NEED TIMELY ACCESS. TO THE DATA BUT WE ALSO NEED A PROCESS AT THE STATE LEVEL TO ENSURE THAT WHAT WE ARE PROVIDING THE MOST EFFECTIVE DRUGS TO MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES AND SO WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OURSELVES WITH HEALTH ACCESSES COMMENTS AND URGE YOU TO CONSIDER MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS PROPOSAL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING BARBARA GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION WE DO SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO LOWER DRUG COSTS I THINK WE ALL SUPPORT THAT. BUT WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT TO ON SOME OF OUR HOSPITALS OF THETHREE FORTY P. PROGRAM AND AND WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN. APPROXIMATELY HUNDRED EIGHTY HOSPITAL'S PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM OUT OF ABOUT. FOUR HUNDRED IN THE IMPACT WOULD VERY DEPENDING ON A PARTICULAR HOSPITAL AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR PHARMACIES WE DO WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT A RURAL HOSPITALS BECAUSE A NUMBER OF A NUMBER OF THEM I THINK WOULD BE IMPACTED GREATLY BY THIS. SO WE APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU HAVE DISCUSSED AND THAT YOU WILL BE LOOKING AT THE TOTAL IMPACT ON OUR PROVIDERS -- AND WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU I ALSO WANT TO MENTION THAT -- AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION JUST THIS YEAR.

GOOD EVENING LEN ACKERMAN TO THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE TWO WOULD LIKE TO APPLAUD THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS UNWILLINGNESS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE OF AND THE NEW ADMINISTRATION. AND COMING INTO OFFICE WE DO ALSO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSED CARVE OUT -- PHARMACY SERVICES ARE CENTRAL TO PATIENT CARE. AND WE'RE CONCERNED THAT -- FULLY CARVING THEM OUT OF MANAGED CARE I'M COULD POTENTIALLY JEOPARDIZE CARE COORDINATION AND CARE MANAGEMENT -- AND WE DO THINK THESE -- THESE ARE CRITICAL FOR HEALTH PLANS TO MAINTAIN -- OVERSEEING IN THE PROGRAM AND SO WE ALSO DO THINK THAT ALTERNATIVES EXIST AND WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND LEGISLATURE. ABOUT HOW TO BOTH LOWER THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AS WELL AS ENSURE THAT -- CLINICAL OUTCOMES CAN CONTINUE TO RAIN REMAIN AS HIGH AS THEY ARE ON THROUGH THE COORDINATION OF CARE THAT OUR PLANS DELIVER THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
