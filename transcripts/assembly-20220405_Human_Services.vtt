INTO THE STATE AND WHAT THAT

02:10:11.303 --> 02:10:13.172
REALLY SHOWED WAS THE LACK OF

02:10:13.238 --> 02:10:15.307
CRISIS CARE FOR SOME OF OUR MOST

02:10:15.374 --> 02:10:16.975

HIGHEST NEEDS. THERE IS AN

02:10:18.443 --> 02:10:20.712
EFFORT LAST YEAR THAT WE RAN IN

02:10:20.779 --> 02:10:21.914
AND UP WORKING THROUGH THE

02:10:21.980 --> 02:10:22.948

02:10:23.015 --> 02:10:25.450

02:10:30.756 --> 02:10:32.558
DOES NOW IS IT IT EXPANDS THOSE

02:10:32.624 --> 02:10:35.794

02:10:38.730 --> 02:10:40.499
TO SUPPORT KIDS IN CRISIS.

02:10:40.566 --> 02:10:42.534
REGARDLESS OF HOW WE CATEGORIZE

02:10:42.601 --> 02:10:45.170
THEM WHETHER THEIR PROBATION

02:10:45.237 --> 02:10:48.373
WHETHER THEIR DEPENDENCY. OR ANY

02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:50.242
OTHER HOMELESS AT ANY OTHER

02:10:50.309 --> 02:10:52.678
CATEGORY WHAT WE NEED TO DO SO

02:10:52.744 --> 02:10:54.780
IS PROVIDE SUPPORTS FOR KIDS AS

02:10:54.846 --> 02:10:56.281

02:10:56.348 --> 02:10:58.217
BILL IS DOING IS EXPANDING THAT

02:10:58.283 --> 02:11:01.453
CRISIS CAPACITY TO KIDS ON

02:11:01.520 --> 02:11:02.955

KIDS WHO ARE MEDICARE ELIGIBLE

02:11:09.027 --> 02:11:10.362

02:11:10.429 --> 02:11:11.463
WE'RE WORKING PRETTY CLOSELY

02:11:11.530 --> 02:11:13.732

DEAL WITH KIDS. AT THE HIGHEST

02:11:28.113 --> 02:11:30.616
LEVEL OF NEED. AND TO EXPAND IT

02:11:30.682 --> 02:11:33.785
SO THAT WE ARE LESS INCLINED TO

02:11:33.852 --> 02:11:35.621

02:11:35.687 --> 02:11:37.856
