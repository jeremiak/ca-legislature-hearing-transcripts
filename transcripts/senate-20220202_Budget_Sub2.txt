WITH THE- EQUITY- HOLDERS COMPETING IN THE MARKET I MEAN IT'S NICE TO TALK ABOUT THE HISTORIC. LAWS SAPHIR APPROACH THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE BUT ANY CASUAL OBSERVER WHAT WENT ON THE MARKET HAS TO BE PAY SOME ATTENTION TO THE OUTSIDE PLAYERS THEY'RE NOT PARTICIPATING OUR EQUITY MARKET I MEAN OR CAP AND TRADE. THEY'RE DOING IT IN EUROPE. WHY THE INSISTENCE ON. THE LITTLE THE AMOUNT OF FOR SINCE WE HAD TO BE DOLLAR IN THE- THAT YOU HAPPEN TO COMPARE WITH THE WITH THEM AND THIS. YOU KNOW. THE PROCESS YOU YOU. YOU CALL ABOUT OF. SIX SIGNAL SEVEN MAY. IT SEEMS IT SEEMS WERE ON A DIFFERENT DAY THAT THAT BOAT HAS SAILED THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SIT THERE WE'RE NOT GOING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT IT EQUITY PLAYERS ARE LOOKING AT THE FEBRUARY MARKET LOOKING AT THE FEBRUARY AUCTION AND- WE KNOW FROM NOVEMBER THE FUTURES ALLOWANCES FOR THIRTY FOUR DOLLARS. YEAH HOW DO I KNOW THAT THE ADMINISTRATION MAINTAINS. A CONSERVATIVE APPROACH AND NOT WANTING TO SPEND ANY MARKET. FROM THE ADMINISTRATION YEAH DURING. THE GROUND YOU HAVE MET A COW OR- WHAT HAS BEEN OCCURRING. AT THE WEEPING BAD DOES PROVIDE A GREATER LEVEL OF INTEGRITY AND THE OXEN AUTHORED BY NOT HAVING. THE STATE HANDLES MARKET SIGNALS HOWEVER WHAT I WILL KNOW IS. ONE OF THE DOCTORS DO OCCUR AND THE ADDITIONAL REVENUES ARE AVAILABLE BEEN DOES BECOME AVAILABLE.

WELL THE SYSTEM PROGRAMMING AG I KNOW YOU KNOW% THE TO IS MY YEARS BEING THE BY CHAIR. AND WE HAVE A RICHEST. HERE IN THE SENATE OF NOT HAVING MANY OF OUR PRO FUNDED MANY OF OUR PROGRAMS MANY OF OUR PRIORITIES FUNDED. AS WITNESSED BY THE EXPENDITURE PLAN THAT YOU HAVE NONE NONE OF THE SENATE PRIORITIES THAT WERE CALCULATED LAST YEAR AND MANY OF THEM. THAT DID NOT GET FUNDED OR GOT TO GOT FUNDED FOR ONE YEAR HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S DISCRETIONARY. BUDGET SO I'LL JUST LEAVE IT THERE BECAUSE WE GOT THE AIRPORT COMING IN AND- THAT WE HAVE. SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT WELL THE PROGRAMS MAY ADVANCE EQUITY WE REALLY LIKE TO FOCUS AND LEAST THAT THE ON DUTY REDUCE CARBON WITH THE THEY KNOCKED REDUCE CARBON ARE THEY AYE CRITERIA POLLUTANTS- POLLUTION PROGRAM.

PAY FOR ALL THE BILLS I MEAN YOU'VE OUTLINED THE BENEFITS OF AIR POLLUTION YOU KNOW I WAS THE CHAIR OF THE QUEUE WHEN WE NEED TO PASS. SB SIX ONE SEVEN THERE WAS ZERO FUNDING FOR THAT. IT WAS A GIANT LEAP THAT WE SAID WE WANT TO DO THIS AND THERE WAS ZERO FUNDING WHY ARE YOU NOT USING SOME OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH MONEY WHY IS IT NOT PART OF THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL PROGRAM. WHY IS CAP AND TRADE PAYING FOR A 100% OF THE CEREMONY THE PROGRAMS WHEN THIS IS A DESIGN TO REDUCE CARBON. YOU KNOW INSURANCE MY APARTMENT A STANCE COLLEAGUES ON THE HEALTHCARE SHE QUESTION. I MEAN I'M NOT I'M NOT I'M NOT A PROBLEM I WON'T DISPUTE THAT IT WOULD BE A FINE PROGRAM I'M JUST SAYING YOU'VE COME HERE WITH THE HUNT PERCENT BEING FUNDED THROUGH CAP AND TRADE PROCEEDS. AND ALL THE NEW PROGRAMS. AND THINGS COMING FROM THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUND. FOR INSTANCE OR PUBLIC HEALTH FUND. GET WERE URGENT. FROM OF FINANCE I'LL GIVE KNOW THAT MYSTERY USED. CAP TRADE PLAN HOLDEN WE- ARE WE'RE- ARE NOT- ONLY. A FULL COVERAGE BEVERAGE. GOT MISSION BROUGHT DELIVERED OPEN. I INCLUDING PUBLIC L. AT THE- PARTICULAR AND- BACKING A- NOW ALL KNOWS. YOU KNOW WITH IN BUDGET IS BUDGET. TALKING ABOUT THE ENTIRE. BUDGET WHICH IS ABOUT TWENTY TWO. FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. I COMBINED LAST YEAR'S ABOUT THIRTY SEVEN BILLION. THERE ARE A LOT OF PROGRAM DAHLE. FEET A LARGE GENERAL FUND FUNDING. FOR- THAT THEY DELIVER SOME OF THE BENEFIT. ARE PARTICULARLY LOOK AT THE BUDGET WITH THAT PACKAGE. MOST OF THAT FACT. ACTUALLY GENERAL FUND IT WITH A PIECE OF IT COMING FROM FROM THE CAP AND TRADE- BUT WE DO. DEFINITELY LOOK AT OTHER FUNDS AREN'T THAT THAT SUPPORT. I'M THESE PROGRAMS. NOW I THINK WHEN HAD TALKING TO. B. EVERY. DOC AND FIND. YOU KNOW. THEIR FOR PATROL FUND DOES HEAVILY. ON ONE THANK OAK THE RED. THAT RESULT. FROM DEMONSTRATION COMMITTEE THAT MAINTAINING A- RESERVE THEIR- AND YOU KNOW THE ARE. ALWAYS KIND OF A- GOING. TO DO ON. THOSE OUT THE REFUSE MATURE. THOUGH THAT THAT DOES CREATE. SOME PRESSURES ARE. THEIR I MEAN WHAT HAVE. IS THAT YOU TO AWAY LETTER. TO TRY TO. CARBON RICH. PROGRAMS OF ALL THE MONEY IS TAKEN FOR AIR POLLUTION I. UNDERSTAND COURTROOM. POLLUTANTS IS AN IMPORTANT. ROLE BUT- YOU GOBBLED UP ALL THE DOUGH. ON A DISCRETIONARY GO. TOE TO. EXPAND ON THESE AIR POLLUTION PROGRAMS AND WE'VE GOT. NATURAL WORKING LAND WEEK THERE'S NOTHING HERE ON METHANE REDUCTION. THERE'S NOTHING HERE BUT NOTHING TOO HUGE. A HUGE PROBLEM AND WE DON'T CUT IT A PENNY HERE. YET YOU'RE THESE FROM. SIX WHERE'S THE BALANCE WHERE'S THE WHERE'S THE BASKETS AT LEAST AT LEAST ON YOUR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE TRUCK YOU ARE GETTING A HUGE. CRITERIA POLLUTANTS IMPROVEMENT BUT WE ARE REDUCING CARBON. SOLVED LOOKING STIPULATED THAT BUT THE OTHER WAS A REALLY. ALL THE- MONITORING AND EXPERT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND ALL THAT I DON'T SEE THE CARBON DIVIDEND. YEAH SO I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN EARLY POINT DEMONSTRATION LOOK THAT OUR OUR CLIMATE FUNDING POLITICALLY. WHICH INCLUDE MULTIPLE FUNDING FOR NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY- JOB FINDER FROM THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND THERE'S ACTUALLY ALREADY FUNDING INCLUDED AND IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET- INTO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE PROPOSED BUDGET AND IN SOME CASES IN THE TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR BUDGET ASSOCIATED WITH THE MULTI YEAR AFTER THAT. FROM LAST YEAR'S WEATHER TO GRAPPLE MAPPING PROGRAMS- LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. WE'RE THE METHANE ONE DAY THERE'S FORTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE GENERAL FUND BILL AND TWO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE I WHICH IS THE- BUT THAT THE COMING BUDGET THE FARMER PROGRAM THERE'S A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS BILL AND- IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FOR THE POWER PROGRAM- SAME GOES FOR URBAN GREENING- AND URBAN GREEN HAS TWO MORE YEARS OF BINDING TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AT TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR- THERE IS ALREADY FUNDING. FROM THE GENERAL FUND THAT WE ALLOCATED IN ACROSS MULTI YEAR PERIOD BUT MINISTRATION LOOK AT OUR CLIMATE BUDGET CLIMATE FUNDING POLITICALLY WHICH INCLUDES MULTIPLE FUNDING FOR IT THOUGH EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T THE BILL PROGRAM UNDER CAP AND TRADE. THEY ARE FUNDED. FROM THE GENERAL. VERY GOOD WE ALL. WELL LET GET ON TO THE NEXT PRESENTER CENTERS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST HAD A QUICK FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT WE'RE DIGGING DEEP ON THE AIR MONITORING- ISSUES- AND MAYBE IT'S A- POLICY CLARIFICATION FROM THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD BUT- CAN IS THE PROPOSAL TO BE ABLE TO USE THIS AIR QUALITY MONITORING FUNDING- COULD IT BE ESSENTIALLY USED FOR- ENTITIES THAT HAVE COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT OR UNDER- SB THIRTY TWO SUCH THAT. WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE OFFSETTING LEGAL OBLIGATIONS OF ENTITIES TO DO KIND OF AIR MONITORING ALREADY IN OTHER WORDS- TO SUBSIDIZING POLLUTERS COMPLIANCE ACCOUNTS BECAUSE MY BIG CONCERN IS WE JUST HADN'T ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY OF A OF A SETTLEMENT AROUND AIR MONITORING WHEN IT COMES TO LISA CANYON- AND IT TOOK A MASSIVE LAWSUIT FROM THE COMMUNITY TO ACTUALLY START TO GET SOME CONTINUOUS AIR MONITORING IN THE REGION EVEN THOUGH. WE KNOW IT'S BEEN LEAKING SINCE IT BLEW OUT IN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT SUBSIDIZING WERE PROPOSING TO SUBSIDIZE THAT KIND OF COMPLIANCE ACTIVITY FROM AN ENTITY LIKE THE GAS COMPANY WITH THIS ACCOUNT- THAT DOES SEEM LIKE. A SMART USE OF GREENHOUSE GAS DOLLARS AND IT ALSO SEEMS TO CONTRAVENE THE UNDERLYING DIRECTIVE IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE THAT WE SORT OF LAID OUT HIS FIRST PRINCIPLES RIGHT THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE THERE SHOULD BE ADDITIONAL EMISSIONS WERE ACHIEVING NOT JUST SUBSIDIZING COMPLIANCE AS YO AS YOU. AS IT WORK SO THE ANY ANY SENSE WHETHER THERE'S RESTRICTIONS ON THIS FUNDING- TO SORT OF NON COME. ENTITIES OR NON COMPLIANCE RELATED ISSUES. ANSWERING THIS IS EATING CHECK ON THEIR RESOURCES BOARD AND I CAN TAKE THAT QUESTION SERVICES THAT THIRTY MILLION. AT B. C. P. OR THE MONITORING THE INTENSE AND THAT THE CITY IS TO CONDUCT MOBILE MONITORING IN COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE. TO DEVELOP BASICALLY A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT YOUR QUALITY LOOKS LIKE AROUND THE ENTIRE STATE SO IT'S REALLY AT A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT- PROGRAMS. WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO. SO IS THAT PROGRAM STILL PROVIDING FUNDING THAT THE ONE I'M REFERRING TO. WHEN YOU SAY THAT PROGRAM IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT FIXED- FOR IN FOR NON MOBILE IS THAT IN IS THERE ARE THERE NON MOBILE ELEMENTS TO THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR AIRMATA IN THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL WE HAVE ANY EXISTING MONITORING NETWORK WITH. AND THERE'S A STATIONARY MONITORS THAT ARE ACROSS THE STATE AS WELL AS SORT OF SPECIAL PROJECTS THAT REDUCE A SPECIAL PROJECT MONITORING LIKE IN THIS PROGRAM THAT MONITORS IN COMMUNITIES IN ORLAND GAS FACILITIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT THERE IS NOT FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS LIKE THAT IN THIS REQUEST BUT THERE IS PASSED FUNDING FROM PASSED CAP AND TRADE THAT SORT OF AS AS A- ARE. THE GENTLEMAN FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAID THAT SORT OF ALREADY BUILT. INTO THE SYSTEM IS THAT'S RIGHT HOW TO LOOK AT IT. A PAST MANY HAS APPLE TREE YES SO WE ARE WE ALREADY. DOLLARS IN YEARS. THAT'S CURRENTLY SUBSIDIZING THAT ACTIVITY EVEN IF IT'S NOT IN THE CURRENT BUDGET ITEM. AND I JUST WANNA BE CLEAR WHEN YOU SEE THAT ACTIVITY JEANINE STATIONARY SOURCE MONITORING BAT- YEAH FOR LIKE SHIP COMPLIANCE FOR SIT. FOR ENTITIES THAT ARE AT ALL THE PRETTY UNDERSTATED TITLE FIVE OPERATING PERMIT OR SOME OTHER CLEAN AIR REQUIREMENTS. BOB IS I KNOW. THERE NOT BEEN. I'M GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FIND MONEY FOR THOSE KINDS OF PURPOSES. THERE IS MONITORING FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW AS- AT MISTER SIEGEL TALKED ABOUT THERE IS MOEY THAT HAS GONE FROM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION PLANS FOR EXAMPLE OR- EIGHTY SIX ONE SEVEN PROGRAMS AND SOME OF THE- THERE IS AN- ELEMENT OF EIGHTY SIX ON SEVEN OF. COMMUNITY ARE MONITORING PROGRAMS- BUT THERE ARE NOT AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER GREENHOUSE GASREDUCTION PROGRAMS AND IT PAID FOR. I'M COMPLAINTS ENTITY MARCHING. OKAY THANK YOU. YEAH LET'S WILL GO TO A QUESTION FROM SEN MCGUIRE AND THEN- CENTER DALIAN AND I'M I'LL JUMP OVER TO THE ALLEY AND LYFT FORGOT TO. GET THE ALLY OWES OVER SATAN JUST SO EVERYBODY'S ON THE SAME PAGE. THIRTY TWO WHICH THREE. EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR FROM CAP AND TRADE TO GO TO MEDICATION EXPIRED AT DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. SO WE'VE BEEN IN TWELVE MONTHS OF THE LOOSEN. AB THREE NINE EIGHT WHERE YOU CAN SPEND IT ON. PURSES AND EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN SO I JUST WANT TO REFRESH EVERYBODY'S MEMORY THAT WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO SPEND THESE MONIES UNDER THE OLD AB THIRTY TO. A REGIME WHICH IS THIS IS OUR THIRTEENTH MONTH UNDER AB THREE NINE EIGHT SAN REQUIRE I DON'T THINK YOU SO MUCH OF MISTER CHAIR IN A REALLY GOOD POINT IN THAT AND I WANT TO. GO BACK TO WHERE THE CHAIR WAS IN A VERY BRIEF RESEARCHER IN REGARDS TO THE ISSUE OF METHANE BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST- LOOK I THINK BOTTOM LINE IS UNDERSTANDING THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING A CONSERVATIVE APPROACH WHEN IT COMES TO CAP AND TRADE FUNDING. I THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABOVE AND BEYOND THE TWO POINT SIX TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION- WHERE THE- ADMINISTRATION THINKS THAT WE'RE GONNA LAND WITH THAT FINE. NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO ON PAGE NINETEEN IN REGARDS TO AT THE BOTTOM. OF THE CENTRALIZING NEXT MANY MODERN. ONE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIRTY MILLION- WON'T BE SUFFICIENT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A STATE WIDE APPROACH. FOR THAT COMMUNITY MONITORING. AND WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING I KNOW WE MAY NOT GET IT HERE TODAY MISTER CHAIRMAN FOLLOW UP. OF HOW THEY INTEND TO BE ABLE TO ROLL THIS OUT IN MORE RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE NUMBER ONE. THE OTHER. HAPPY TO BE ABLE TO TAKE. IN ON BOTH OF THE AT ONCE. IS A- SERGIO FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCING HE SO MUCH SIR FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. I UNDERSTAND THAT METHANE REDUCTION ESPECIALLY. CAN'T MINORE MANAGEMENT. HAS BEEN IN NINE CAP AND TRADE FUNDS BUT THAT'S JUST BE REALLY CANDID.THE ONLY WAY THAT WE'RE GONNA HIT THE THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE COMMITMENT A 40% REDUCTION. BY TWENTY THIRTY IS THAT DAIRIES ARE EITHER CLOSING. OR THEY'RE LEAVING THE STATE. THAT'S THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA HIT THAT AND WE'VE UNDERFUNDED CONSISTENTLY- WHEN IT COMES TO MANURE MANAGEMENT IN BOTH LARGE AND SMALL GEHRY SITES WE CONTINUE TO DO THAT IN THIS BUDGET AS WELL. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WE'RE GONNA COME BACK AND HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT A COMMITMENT THAT WAS MADE AT TO THIS INDUSTRY UNDER THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE AND HOW WE CAN HELP THEM AHIEVE AT 40% REDUCTION WITHOUT THEM EITHER. BUT THE CALLES INTO U. HAUL. ARE CLOSING THEIR DOORS. TO HAVE A COMMENT FROM FINANCE. I DON'T TOLERATE YOU'RE JUST KIND OF THE- LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING DISCUSSION THEN AND AGAIN AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THERE WILL BE ANOTHER BIG IT REVENUE AT THE END OF YOUR VISION THE REFLECT KIND OF ANY ADDITIONAL OXFORD BROOKES B. FROM FROM THE ACTUAL THAT OCCUR OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS SO- YOU KNOW I DO. DIGITAL DISCUSSION. BUT AND- THIS IS A FRIENDLY THIS BEEN A PER OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE FOR THREE FOUR YEARS ON ON- METHANE AND- CHESTER'S MANURE MANAGEMENT CENTER DOLLY. WELL THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN I HAVE A ITS KIND ALONG THE LINES OF THE U. S. SENATOR FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT JUST MENTIONED SO. YOU KNOW. THE QUESTION I WANT TO ASK IS IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED IN CALIFORNIA THAT. THE COST OF LIVING IS SKYROCKETING. WE HAVE FUEL PRICES THAT ARE FOUR DOLLARS A GALLON YOU IT'S A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD AN APARTMENT. WE HAVE SINCE WE PAY THAN AVERAGE IN THE NATION. AND A LOT OF THAT IS DIRECTED BACK TO THE POLICIES THAT COME OUT OF THIS CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD RIGHT HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE HE AND THEN OUR- YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION THEN FIX OUR PRIORITIES BUT I BUT BUT MY QUESTION IS. AND THIS MY QUESTION ACROSS ALL THE ITEMS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS HOW DO YOU. COME UP WITH. THE REDUCTION IN CARBON WHO ACTUALLY MEASURES WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET FOR WHAT WE'RE PAYING FOR. YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN VERY LOUD ABOUT. CARBON IN THE STATE I WANT TO LEAD IN ACTUALLY REDUCING CARBON AND I DON'T THINK THE PRIORITIES OF THESE BUDGETS ACTUALLY IT THAT WE'RE WE'RE PAYING FOR A FERRARI BUT WE'RE GETTING A BICYCLE WITH A FLAT TIRE. I MEAN SOMEBODY TELL ME. HOW MUCH CARBON YOU'RE ACTUALLY REDUCE WE SPEND IN THIS IN THIS IN THIS PROPOSAL WE'RE GONNA SPEND FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR ONCE AGAIN. ON THE TRAIN DOES THE HIGH SPEED TRAIN THE COST OF GAS AND DIESEL. AND IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED IF THE LOW AND EVEN WE TALK ABOUT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IF YOU COULD REDUCE THE COST OF A GALLON OF GAS BY A DOLLAR THAT HELPS DISADVANTAGED LOW INCOME PEOPLE RICH PEOPLE IN THE STATE CAN AFFORD TO PAY THAT AND THEY CAN AFFORD TO DRIVE AN SUV. IT THE SAP. ZERO EMISSIONS VEHICLE SO TELL ME HOW YOU MEASURE AND HOW YOU COME UP WITH THE PRIORITIES BECAUSE THE PRIORITIES ARE ABOUT REDUCING THE CARBON AND ACTUALLY HELP IN THE ENVIRONMENT. AIRPORT AIRPORT CAN WE HAVE A RESPONSE. CERTAINLY SO I'LL DEFERRED US ON ALLEGATIONS OF COURSE BUT AS FAR AS MEASUREMENT GIRLS WE TRACK THIS VERY CLOSELY FOR EACH PROGRAM WE SPEND A GREAT DEAL OF TIME ENSURING THAT WE CAN QUANTIFY ITS GREENHOUSE GAS AND CRITERIA BENEFITS AND WE TRY TO REPORT THAT VERY TRANSPARENTLY EVERY YEAR INDEED RESPONSE TO RECENT AUDIT WE FOUND EVEN FURTHER CONTRACTED CALLIN OTHERS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE REST MASTERS CLEAN THERE IS THE CANDIDATE WHAT I CAN SAY WITH REGARD TO COST THIS IS SOMETHING WE THINK A LOT ABOUT WHENEVER REALLY CORE PRIORITIES PROGRAM DESIGN INSURING THAT REGULAR FOLKS. BUT ONLY GET ACCESS TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES FOR THAT THE WHOLE TRANSITION IS JUST CLEAR INNOVATIVE WE CAN BE THAT'S ONE REASON WHY WE'RE SO EXCITED FROM THAT WELL OVER HALF OF OUR FUNDS ARE GOING TO DISADVANTAGED OR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES- ON WHY WE CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE INVESTMENTS IN SMALL FLEETS ON ORDINARY X. ALONE CAN KILL. I WE WORK SO. WHEN SURE THAT. I'M SURE A FEELING AT THIS IS DISTRIBUTED AT. SO A HUGE. PRIORITY FOR US THAT COMPLIANCE WITH THE BEST WORK TRAINING TO CARE DEEPLY ABOUT. AND I'M IN CONTINUE TO WORK TO ENSURE. THAT OUR PROGRAM JUST DEEP AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. AND DRIVE INNOVATION SO SOME OF THE AREAS THAT YOU'RE ABOUT IN TERMS OF. RESEARCH INNOVATION HERE POINT I'M REALLY GO TO THAT POINT TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE JUST ENSURING THAT FOLKS HAVE ACCESS TO ZERO MISSION CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY NOW REGIONAL COST. BUT ALSO ON ALLOWING US TO KEEP BUILDING TECHNOLOGY TOMORROW AND HAVE THE SHOTS BEING CALIFORNIA TO. GOING FORWARD AND JUST ONE LET YOU KNOW THAT WE ALWAYS REALLY FOCUSED ON HONING HIS ESTIMATES AND FOCUSES EVERY YEAR. AND THE PUBLIC PROCESSES WE WORK THROUGH WHETHER IT'S ON THE FUNDING PLAN OR PARTICULAR PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS ALWAYS HOW WE'RE GETTING GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY. OUR ENSURING THAT EVERYBODY BENEFITS BY THE CHICHI CARE PLANTS ARE TOXICS AND THAT WILL LOOK AT THE WHOLE PICTURE WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR GUIDANCE ON YOU KNOW ISSUES WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT. HE CONSIDERATIONS WE GO FORWARD SO I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION WITH IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES TO IT. MAYBE YOU CAN HELP US OUT ON THE I'M NOT A GUN MISTER DALI TECHNIQUE I SEE THINK US FOR QUANTIFICATION SO IT WHAT WHAT STE I THINK DRINKING WATER PROGRAM HOW MANY METRIC TONS OF CARBON WE COULD REDUCE WITH THE HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION TO GO CENTER WHAT IS AT WORK AFTER. A DOLLAR PER TON. I CAN'T SPEAK. TO THE DRINKING. PROGRAM TODAY AND HAPPY HASSELT LOOK INTO IT I CANCER. TO EVERY HOUSE GOT PRODUCTION. FOR ANYTHING PROBLEMS IN THE BUDGET THOUGH AND GIVE ME A SENSE. EACH ONE OF THEM COMES WITH MANY MILLIONS OF REDUCTIONS. AIR POLLUTION SO. HAPPY SHARE THAT WITH COMMITTEE. IN ANY FORM IS USEFUL. I JUST HI I CANNOT TELL YOU HOW FRUSTRATED I AM THIS IS MY- THIRD YEAR ON THIS THIS COMMITTEE AND- YOU KNOW I DEEPLY CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT AND I'VE I'VE- FIVE AUG I WILL NOT GIVE UP ON THINGS THAT I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT AND THEN I BELIEVE ARE JUST- WRONG. WRONG ABOUT HOW WHAT'S THE TRUTH. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS. YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE POLICIES THAT COME OUT OF THIS THIS COMMITTEE AND THIS LEGISLATURE ARE DRIVING THE COST UP OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT WE GETTING FULL YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL ME HOW YOU HAVE A THERE'S NO PROCESS EVEN MAJOR HOW MUCH CARBON REDUCTION REDUCING. I'D LIKE TO KNOW FOR THE- YOU KNOW BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE SPENT SO FAR. ON THE HIGH SPEED TRAIN TO NOWHERE. HOW MUCH CARBON WE CAN REDUCE I MEAN LAST YEAR WE HEARD AND I'M ON BUDGET AND WE HEARD THAT. IT MAY BE ONLY ONE LANE TRACK NOW AND IT MAY NOT EVEN BE ELECTRIC. SO THE I'M ABOUT THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT WHAT WERE PASSED ON TO OUR KIDS ARE WE REALLY DO SOME CARPET NO WE DON'T WE DON'T COUNT THE CARBON OUTPUT FROM FOREST FIRES BUT WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE POINT TILLMAN WE WANT TO TAX THE PEOPLE WHAT IT WHAT IS SUCH A NEW LOOK AT ALL THE SMOKE LOOK AT THE AIR QUALITY IS COMING FROM FOUR STARS BUT THIS BUDGET HAS A COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN IT. FINALLY BUT- BUT LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE S. THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE COVERED IN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WERE SUPPOSED TO HELP BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THAT'S NOT VERY FAR. WE'RE GONNA HAVE ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA. REALLY LAST SUMMER HE TOLD US DON'T PLUG ME IN BECAUSE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE ISN'T SET UP FOR. OUR LETTERING SYSTEM IS NOT SET UP FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES SO MAYBE WE OUGHT TO THINK ABOUT. THE INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE CAN HELP ELECTRIC VEHICLES BEFORE WOULD MANDATE ELECTRIC VEHICLES FOR EVERYBODY. WE HAVE A FAILING INFRASTRUCTURE WE WERE WE WERE TOLD IN THE NINETIES AND IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN WE SAW WHEN WE PASSED AB THIRTY TWO THAT WHEN THE STATE PASSED SB THIRTY THE FIRST. GREEN IN THE LEADING THE WORLD CALIFORNIA LEAD THE WORLD AND WHAT WE HAVE NATURAL GAS TO BRIDGE OURSELVES INTO. SOLAR AND WIND AND ALL THESE OTHER CLEAN ENERGY I'M ALL pHAVE SOLAR MORE SOLAR WE'RE ACTUALLY PAYING OTHER STATES TO TAKE OUR SOLAR AND ARE. BARLOW DISADVANTAGE INCOME PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE CLASS ARE PAYING THEIR ELECTRIC RATES TO PAY FOR THAT MONEY TO GO TO ANOTHER STATE THAT'S THE FAX. AND FOR GOD'S SAKES GIVE US. A PLAN HOW ABOUT A PLAN THAT ACTUALLY SAYS THIS IS HOW MUCH CARBON YOU'RE GONNA REDUCE. BY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY CALIFORNIANS ARE PAYING PEOPLE ARE FLEEING THE STATE BUSINESS RIPPLING THE STATE THAT MEANS REVENUE SLING THE STATE. WE'RE NOT LEADING THE WORLD. STE FOR SOMEBODY HAVE IT THEY HAD A PLAN OUT HOW THESE ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO WORK. WE'RE TAKING ALL KINDS OF MONEY IN. TONS OF MONEY AND THERE'S NO PLAN HERE. I READ TO THESE SEVENTY FIVE PAGES I GOT LAST NIGHT. AND WHAT WE GOT. WE'RE GONNA SPEND WE'RE GOING TO PROMISE THE WORLD TO CALIFORNIA AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO DELIVER. IT'S WRONG. I'M SORRY AND I CAN'T TAKE IT ANY LONGER THIS IS RIDICULOUS GIVE US A PLAN OF HOW MUCH CARBON RUSSIAN REDUCE. AND AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL SUPPORT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. D. MISTER MISTER ROSS SCHOOL WHAT THE ENERGY COMMISSION DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THE ELECTION OR I GUESS OF THIS FUEL PROGRAM ALL RIGHT I EVIDENTLY THE PUBLIC COMMENT PHONE NUMBER I HAVE TO REPEAT HIS SITES I SENATE INCORRECT. EIGHT FOUR FOUR TWO NINE ONE SIX THREE SIX FOUR- LET'S BEFORE WE GO. LET'S GO TO THE L. A. L. BECAUSE I FORGOT I WAS REMISS ABOUT ASKING THE ALLEY- ABOUT THE GENERAL DIRECTION THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL ON CAP AND TRADE IN THE REVENUE DISCUSSION. MISTER BROWN GOOD MORNING. MORNING THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- SO THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALREADY SORT OF DESCRIBE THEIR- PROPOSAL FOR DISCRETIONARY CAP AND TRADE EXPENDITURE PLAN- OUR OFFICE RELEASED OUR INITIAL ANALYSIS LAST WEEK- THAT'S AVAILABLE UP ON OUR WEBSITE- AO DOT CA DOT GOV- ALSO THE- I THINK THE LARGE MAJORITY OF IT IS ALSO A COPY AND PUT IN YOUR AGENDA TODAY. SOME SOME TRY TO HIT ON SOME OF THE HIGHLIGHTS FROM THAT INITIAL TAKEN ANALYSIS FIRST ON THE REVENUE AND AVAILABLE FUNDS WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN TOPIC OF SOME DISCUSSION- I THINK FIRST THING TO SAY IF YOU WANT TO. BECAUSE I WHAT I MISSED. IT IS THERE IS A LOT UNCERTAIN AROUND. REVENUE AND I'M- ALL THE MEMBERS AND COMMITTEE OR KIND OF AWARE THAT GOVERNOR'S ASSUMPTIONS ARE. AND YEAH THERE'S A THERE'S A WIDE VARIATION BUT WE DO THINGS- THERE'S LIKELY TO BE- ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS OR MORE IN KIND OF. A CAP AND TRADE REVENUE OVER BOTH THE CURRENT YEAR AND THE BUDGET YEAR- AND SO AFTER KIND OF SOME OF THAT MONEY WOULD BE- CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED THAT WOULD LEAVES. ROUGHLY SEVERAL HUNDRED SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR DISCRETIONARY SPENDING SORT OF ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT THE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ASSUMES- BUT I ALSO JUST SORT OF REITERATE AGAIN THAT YOU KNOW THESE ARE SUBJECT TO A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY. AND WE WILL UP BY COMPLICATED. REVENUE ESTIMATES INFORMATION AROUND THE TIME OF THE NAY REVISED ONE SALES. I'M MORE UP TO DATE INFORMATION ON KIND OF MORE RECENT ARCHIVE. SUBSEQUENT OPTIONS OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. SO THE- SO THING I WANTED TO ON QUICK AS- REALLY MORE HONEST. SIDE AND JUST AN ISSUE THAT. THE COME UP QUITE AS MUCH IN THIS DISCUSSION BUT ONE THING WE DO THINK THE LEGISLATURE ONE I KIND OF THINK ABOUT IS THE- CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS SO A LOT OF THE DISCUSSION AND USE. AND CAN BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARINGS ARE RUN AROUND THROUGH THE DISCRETIONARY PACKAGE BUT WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT. THOSE CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS 65% OF THEM ROUGHLY SORT OF SORT OF THE REVENUES CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED- AND SUPPORTING CONNECT- DID YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT WHETHER THOSE ARE. THE LEGISLATURE IS HIGHEST PRIORITIES. MOST OF THOSE CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS WERE AGREED UPON AS PART OF THE TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEEN BUDGET PACKAGE OWN PRIORITIES CAN CHANGE- SO WE THINK IT'S ALWAYS. IMPORTANT THE LEGISLATURE TO KIND OF CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THOSE- ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT- IN A WORLD WHERE REVENUES ARE HIGHER. AND QUITE A BIT HIGHER. THE PAST TO WONDER ARE GONNA. BASELINE REVENUE AS- CONTINUES A PROGRAM. AND ROUGHLY TWICE AS HIGH AS THEY HAVE BEEN IN MANY GREAT. YEAR SOME SORT. OF THAT MAKES IT WE THINK SORT OF MORE TO KIND OF CONTINUE TO AT THOSE THINK ABOUT WHETHER THOSE. CONTINUE TO REFLECT WHAT PRIORITIES. UNDER DISCUSSION EXPENDITURE PLAN OF COURSE THERE'S A LOT OF THIS ALWAYS COMES DOWN TO. PRIORITIES BETWEEN. THE LEGISLATURE NOT PRIORITIZES GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS VERSUS LOCAL AIR POLLUTION. AND OTHER FACTORS- I GOT THINKING ABOUT THIS YEAR IN PARTICULAR THINKING ABOUT HOW IT SORT OF FITS IN WITH OTHER FUND SOURCES THAT ARE OUT THERE THAT ARE PAYING FOR MANY OF THESE ACTIVITIES. AS AIRPORT WENT THROUGH NOT A LOT OF MONEY IN THAT ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE SPACE FROM OTHER FUND SOURCES OF THINKING ABOUT HOW THE- GREENHOUSE GAS PIECES FIT TOGETHER WITH THE GENERAL FUND USES ANOTHER FUND SOURCES. THE LAST THING AND I JUST WANNA TOUCH ON REAL QUICKLY IS THE THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR ONE TIME ALSO FOR MOBILE MONITORING THIS IS REALLY. THE ONLY NEW PROPOSAL AS PART OF THIS YEAR'S- BUDGET I G. R. F. BUDGETS- WE DO THINK THAT YOU KNOW AND CONCEPT BETTER. AIR QUALITY MONITORING AND KIND OF BETTER INFORMATION AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OF AIR QUALITY- IS- IS SOMETHING THAT HAS. BEEN AMERICA- I THINK- OUR MAIN QUESTIONS ARE WE THINK IT'S REALLY COMMON CLEAR. WHY THIS A PROPOSED APPROACH IS THE BEST APPROACH TO KIND OF GETTING THAT TYPE OF INFORMATION. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I THINK WE WANTED TO FIGHT FOR THE COMMITTEE WHICH- AND I WANT TO KIND OF- ASKED THE ADMINISTRATION TO. COMMENT MORE ON IT WHICH IS WHY IS WHY KIND OF ABOUT THE SORT OF NEW MOBILE. MONITORING APPROACH RATHER THAN. SOME OF THE OTHER EXISTING- EFFORTS WE HAVEN'T. LIKE THAT SIX. MY UP JUST OF EXPANDING UPON THAT- WHY DON'T YOU RELY. MONITORING RIGHT THAN SORT OF STATION MONITOR. TO DO SOME OF THAT WERE. AND WHY A KIND OF FOCUS ON THIS ONE TIME STRUCTURE- AND- YOU KNOW HOW HOW CAN CAN GOT IN FOR. REALLY USED AS OF MONITOR CHANGE OVER TIME- THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SORT OF THOSE TWO. WHAT A WINE SO SORT OF WHAT YOUR WHAT WHAT WOULD BE GETTING FROM THIS ONE TIME STOCKS ON HOW THAT HELP US. KIND OF AN ON GOING BASIS. SO AGAIN WE SORT OF YOU KNOW THE SUGGESTED THE COMMITTEE KIND OF EXPLORE THOSE QUESTIONS PERHAPS IN THIS HEARING OR AND- SUBSEQUENT MEETINGS AND IF YOU KNOW DOESN'T REDUCE OR SATISFACTORY RESPONSES TO THOSE QUESTIONS BUT I THINK IT. MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER- REDIRECTING SOME OF THE FUNDS FROM THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL TO OTHER. EXISTING EFFORTS ARE PROGRAMS THAT ARE HIGH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES SO. I WILL- IN MY COMMENTS THERE ARE NONE. OF COURSE. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU. PERHAPS WE CAN HAVE THE ERROR- COM. ON WHY THE PROGRAM AND ALSO IN PAGE TWENTY FOUR OF OUR STAFF REPORT WE TALK ABOUT THE FOURTEEN EXISTING. A COMMUNITY LEVEL AIR QUALITY. AIR QUALITY MONITORING NETWORK SO. WHY THE MOBILE ONE THIS TIME WHAT'S WHAT'S THE EXTRA. X. SHARE AD THIS IS AJ AT THEIR RESOURCES WERE NOT HAPPY TO TAKE THAT QUESTION SO THE MOBILE MONITORING WELL LET ME LET ME START WELL THEN- MONITORING IS REALLY DESIGNED FOR A DIFFERENT PURPOSE THAN WHAT. WE'RE DOING AND IT MAY EVEN SIX ONE SEVEN PROGRAM SAID THAT IN THE EIGHTY SIX ONE SEVEN PROGRAMS THERE ARE I NATION'S COMMUNITY AIR MONITORING PROGRAMS THAT ARE GOING ON IN MOST OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN SELECTED. AND THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE COMMUNITY STERN COMMITTEES IN EACH ONE OF THE BURNERS AND COMMUNITIES WORKING WITH THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS. VERY VERY HIGHLY TAILORED THE QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMUNITIES ASKING THEIR VERY INDIVIDUALIZED I'M PROGRAMS BASED ON WHAT THE COMMUNITY WANTS TO KNOW- ARE THEY CONCERNED IT HAPPENED ABOUT A SPECIFIC SOURCE ARE THEY INTERESTED IN BEING ABLE TO. FIND OUT IF KIDS CAN GO OUT YOU KNOW PLATE RECESS SO THEY'RE VERY VERY SORT OF TAILORED AND SPECIFIC. WE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS REALLY DIFFERENT IT'S REALLY TO GET A SNAPSHOT. OF AIR QUALITY AT A VERY GRANULAR LEVEL THAT STARTED A BLOCK BY BLOCK LEVEL AROUND THE ENTIRE STATE. AND SO THE GOAL OF THIS IS REALLY TO JUST TAKE THAT SNAPSHOT TO BE ABLE TO LET COMMUNITIES KNOW WHAT'S THE AIR QUALITY LIKE IN YOUR COMMUNITY. IN THIS. ONE TIME SORT OF WAY. I GUESS THE IS WHY- YOU KNOW THERE ARE MY- THE QUICK THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE. TAKING GET A THEIR MOBILE UNIT AND DRIVE AROUND AND GIVE YOU THE- CALL THE NUMBER BUT CAN ALSO GIVE YOU THE METHANE NUMBER WHICH IS WHICH IS THERE THEY CAN GIVE YOU OVER. TOXIC NUMBER THAT THAT'S THERE SO THEY GIVE YOU A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT THINGS- AT THE DATA THAT'S IMPORTANT MAYBE THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES NOT ASKING ABOUT IT. MAYBE THE LOCAL COMMUNITY TO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A HIGH METHANE SO WIDE LIMITED JUST TO THIS ONE. MEASUREMENT VERSUS ALL THESE OTHER TOXICS AND HAZARDOUS AND METHANE AND CARBON NUMBERS MAY BE SKY HIGH WHAT WAS YOUR THINKING. WILL BE INTENSE IS ACTUALLY THAT WE WOULD BE MORE. FOR STARTED I'M GONNA CALL THEM LIKE MAJOR GASHES POLLUTANTS. FOR TOXICS AND MANY OF THE SYSTEMS ALSO TO MONITOR FOR METHANE SO I THINK THAT THOSE ARE THINGS THAT COULD BE ROLLED INTO THIS. OBVIOUSLY WE BEGAN TO CHARACTER PROCESS TO DEVELOP A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL AND WORK WITH CONTRACTORS ON WHAT IS. IN THE REALM OF THE POSSIBLE ON THIS AND SO BUT THE INTENT IS TO INCLUDE MORE THAN JUST. AND SORT OF MAYBE IF YOU'RE THINKING LIKE JUST OZONE OR JUST YOU KNOW PARTICULATE MATTER THE INTENT IS TO INCORPORATE AND- TOXICS AND METHANE AND OTHER. ADDED AS WELL DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY OF BC'S. I HAVE. WHO'S MY PER. DEPUTY DIRECTOR ROSCHMANN EITHER. FIVE GOOD MORNING SHARED CHIU FRIEDMAN HAS HAD TO STEP AWAY TO ATTEND THE ASSEMBLY SUB THREE COMMITTEE HEARING I'M VERY SORRY TO SAY THAT MY NAME IS ANGELA SOME ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CLIMATE AND ENERGY- AND WORK DIRECTLY FORTY FRESHMAN I'M HAPPY TO- TO- ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SHE DON'T HAVE A PRESENTATION- NO WE WERE NOT AS TO PROVIDE A PRESENTATION OKAY FIVE THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE LET'S GO TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN TAYLOR WITH THE COASTAL COMMISSION I'M ALSO HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO BE HAPPY TO MAKE A BRIEF PRESENTATION IF YOU'D LIKE. BRING IT BACK TO OTHER MEMBERS SENATOR STERN WE HAD A QUESTION APPROPRIATIONS. YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THERE'S SOME. I DON'T THINK IT'S IT MAY JUST GO BACK TO THE RESEARCH SUPPORTER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT- IT IS ONE OF OUR CONTINUES APPROPRIATIONS TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES FUND. WHO WHO'S THE- RIGHT PERSON TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT SORT OF PERFORMANCE OF THAT. FUND THUS FAR IN WHAT WE'VE SEEN OUT OF THAT PROGRAM. THEIR DRUG OUR PARTY FINANCING I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY PARTY- FROM THE AGENCY ON THE DATE THAT QUESTION BE COULD TAKE ANY QUESTIONS BACK. THE ONE THING I DID WANT TO JUST POINT TO WHICH I CAN GET YOUR QUESTION- ANSWERED ALL THESE. BELOW THE ADMINISTRATOR BUT FELL AN ANNUAL REPORT ON THE CAP AND TRADE FUNDING WHICH ACTUALLY INCLUDE OUTCOMES- ON THE PROJECT- FUNDED. THE LEVEL OF GST REDUCTION THE FILIPINO WITH THE COMMUNITY COMMUNITY IMPACT OF THE DIFFERENT SOURCES OR THE DIFFERENT ABOUT THE FUNDING PROVIDED EACH PROGRAM. AT THOUGH FOR THE CABIN PRE FUNDED PROGRAMS THERE IS ACTUALLY AN ANNUAL REPORT THAT IT PUT OUT PUBLICLY IDENTIFIED A LOT OF THE OUTCOME OR THE SPECIFIC PROGRAM. AND ALSO GET A LOT OF LIKE READING ABOUT BOTH OF THE THINGS THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE DOING. DON'T HAVE DETAILS ON SOME OF THE OUTCOME- WE'RE WE'RE DEFINITELY HAPPY TO SHARE THAT- BY WORKING YOU DON'T HAVE. I THINK A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT TO SPEAK IT IN DETAIL ON THAT PARTICULAR CONTINUE REPEATED PROGRAM. OKAY I YEAH I WOULD JUST IVU I SAW THAT. WHAT THREE FOUR DAYS AGO I THINK EIGHT HUNDRED EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS WAS AWARDED. UNDER RECENT- A RE FOR SEVEN DIFFERENT FOR ALL OVER THE STATE- AND ACTUALLY WHAT I WILL SAY IS I HAVE A I GUESS A SIMILAR- MAYBE IT SOUNDS LIKE A SIMILAR QUESTION BUT A VERY DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON ON THE PROGRAM AND THE REPORTING THIS FAR SO- TO MY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YEP MY CONCERN IS NOT THAT YOU'RE NOT TRACKING- DOLLARS OR EMISSIONS I THINK YOU KNOW THE STRICTURES BE PUT IN PLACE IF ANYTHING- YOU KNOW PUT A THE- OVERLY. AS WELL OVERLY WAITING THE GREENHOUSE GAS DOLLAR PER TON METRIC- THAT WE USED TO SORT OF. BE OUR OSTENSIBLE THESIS FOR SPENDING THIS FUNDING SO I DON'T I DON'T ACTUALLY THINK WE'RE NOT TRACKING THE NUMBERS AND I. WOULD REJECT THAT PREMISE I ALSO THINK THAT YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS LIKE- COUNTY FOREST CARBON- THAT THAT THAT WOULD BE. A FINE FINE CONCEPT- ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANTED TO INTEGRATED INTO THE OVERALL INVENTORY. AND MAKE THAT SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS LIKE THE OTHER REPORTING ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT TO BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT. THAT NECESSARILY IS IN THE INTEREST OF THAT INDUSTRY AT THIS POINT SO WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT KIND OF PROPOSAL TAKE ANY SHAPE SO I DON'T CONSIDER THE SENATE- VERARCHING CRITIQUE NECESSARILY OF HOW THE- ADMINISTRATION OF THE AIRPORT'S TRACKING THE DOLLARS I. THINK IT'S VERY DETAILED AND METICULOUS- MY QUESTION WAS JUST MORE ABOUT WHAT PERFORMANCE WE SEEN HOW MANY UNITS FOR INSTANCE ARE HOW MANY BEDS WE THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET BUILT OUT OF THE- THE NEARLY BILLION DOLLARS WE JUST SPENT AND HOW WE'RE DOING ON A- SORT OF DOLLAR PER BED BASIS NOT NECESSARILY A DOLLAR PER TON BASIS- BECAUSE- LOWEST DOLLAR PER TONNE EX. INVESTMENTS AREN'T ALWAYS THE SMARTEST FOR THE PUBLIC TO BE MAKING IT STUFF THAT ACTUALLY PRIVATE SECTORS IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO BE MAKING. AND I OFTEN THINK WE SHOULD BE REACHING- WE ARE IN THE FUNDING THE LOW INCOME HOUSING FUNDING AND THINGS THAT. MAY NOT LOOK LIKE THE LOWEST DOLLAR PER TIME BUT ACTUALLY ARE THE BIGGEST GAP IN THE BIGGEST NEEDS SO. IF THERE'S ANY WAY TO GET SOME ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK ON IT- WHAT WASN'T AWARDED DURING THE LAST OF HSE AND WHAT'S ANTICIPATED FOR THE FUTURE FUNDING ROUNDS- THAT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTING TO ME AND ESPECIALLY HOW IT INTERFACES WITH THE GOVERNOR'S. COMMITMENT ON INFILL- FUNDING AROUND AFFORDABLE HOUSING I THINK THERE WAS AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS SO. MY QUESTION% JUST FOR FOLLOW UP IS ABOUT HOW THE CHSE PIECE WELL SORT OF INTERACT WITH- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR SURE MORE INITIAL TRANSIT ORIENTED AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENTS. AND WHETHER THOSE TWO PROGRAMS ARE TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND WHETHER- WHETHER ALSO THE EXTREME HEAT STRESS. CONCERT INTEGRATED SO ARE ALL THOSE ARE TODAY PROGRAM TALKING TO OTHER SO HOPEFUL FOR FUTURE. BY IN WRITING HEARING WE CAN GET INTO TO OUR OUR COUNTERPART- INDUSTRY THAT PROGRAM AND I GUESS DIGITAL DIESEL. I MISS IT. HI YOU'LL GET BACK TO US LATER PART LET'S GO THE SENATE MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR LOOK I KNOW THAT WE'RE LOOKING INTO CONTINUOUS- APPROPRIATION WITHIN CAP AND TRADE- THE ONE ITEM I JUST THINK THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BE ABLE TO FLAG AS WE MOVE FORWARD. IS ON SEA LEVEL RISE. AND IT MAY BE TIME AT CANDIDLY IT'S PAST DUE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT SEA LEVEL RISE. IN THE DOLLARS THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PLAN FOR THAT CRISIS THAT'S KNOCKING ON OUR DOOR. THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF CARE RIGHT CASKEY IN THIS BUDGET SUB LAST YEAR. THIRTY ONE MILLION ONE TIME WAS APPROPRIATED TO THE COASTAL COMMISSION. ON SEA LEVEL RISE AND PROVIDING LOCAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS- BOTTOM LINE IS THIS IS A DROP IN THE BUCKET. WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT IS GOING TO BE LAPPING UP AGAINST. COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE CALIFORNIA COAST. AND THE NEED IS BEYOND GREAT SO I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A FURTHER CONVERSATION ABOUT. I KNOW THAT IT WOULD. ADD ANOTHER PERMANENT CATEGORY. AND AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH- THE LONGER WE WAIT THE WORSE IT'S GOING TO GET WE HAVE LITERALLY TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS CHEST IN PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE. LET ALONE AND THE IMPACT IT IS GOING TO HAVE ON HOUSING. AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WITH BUSINESSES SUGGEST SOMETHING ALONG THE FLAG. AND THIRTY ONE MILLION SIMPLY IS NOT GOING TO CUT IT BUT THE COST COMMISSION.SHORT TERM ESPECIALLY LONG TERM. AB OF. SWEDEN I KNOW WE HAVE TO MOVE ON HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE L. A. L. ON THE IDEA OF A RESERVE THAT WE WOULD USE. LET'S LET'S STIPULATE THAT IT'S A VOLATILE MARKET. NOBODY WANTS TO PUT THE CRYSTAL BALL AND SEE WHAT THE OPTIONS COULD BE LIKE IN TWO WEEKS BUT IT IS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. AND YOU SUGGESTED IF WE IF WE GET FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OR FIVE BILLION DOLLARS 210% RESERVE WOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED TO. FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT WE WOULD WE WOULD YOU SERVE WHY WOULDN'T WE TAKE THAT OUT OR STRUCTURE IT AS PART OF THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION SO THAT THE DISCRETIONARY NUMBERS. TO FUND THESE. NEW PROGRAMS WHAT WITH THAT WHY WOULD THAT NOT BE A BETTER. ARCHITECTURAL STEP TO TAKE RATHER THAN TAKE IT OUT OF THE DISCRETIONARY FUNDS. I MEAN I THINK A LOT OF IT JUST SORT OF COMES DOWN TO AGAIN KIND OF- PRIORITIES I MEAN SORT OF THE WAY AS YOU'RE SORT OF I THINK YOU'RE REFERENCING SORT OF THE WAY IT'S SET UP NOW IT'S SORT OF- YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE SORT OF SHUTTERS. REVENUE VOLATILITY THE CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS DO LIKE OF REVENUE WERE DROPPED FOR EXAMPLE THAT CONTINUES TO GROW CREATIONS. DO AUTOMATICALLY DON'T GO DOWN SO IT DOES SORT OF HAVE A- BUILT IN MECHANISM THERE WHERE IT KIND OF HELPS THAT SORT OF BOTTOM LINE RESERVE. FUND SO IT THAT'S KIND OF ALREADY. BUILT IN THERE BUT THEN THE REST OF THE STATIONARY PROGRAM SORT OF YOU KNOW HAVE TO KIND OF HAVE A RESERVE IN THE FUNDS TO KIND OF COVER. IT WHATEVER THEY MIGHT LOSE ANY REVENUE DROPS SO. BLOOD SUGAR COULD SORT OF YOU KNOW KIND OF- RE SHRINKS OUT I MEAN THAT'S PART OF THE KIND OF DISCUSS ANY ANY DISCUSSION THAT MIGHT OCCUR AROUND CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS- I THINK A LOT OF IT JUST DEPENDS ON. HOW ONE WHICH PROGRAMS YOU PRIORITIZE AND TWO IF YOU ARE GOING TO CONSPIRACY APPROPRIATE MONEY. MAYBE THINKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT. FOR THOSE HIGH PRIORITY PROGRAMS WHETHER YOU WANT THEM TO COME OUT. AUTOMATICALLY GET A SORT OF LOWER OR HIGHER SURE REVENUE DEPENDING ON AUCTION PROCEEDS BY KIND OF HAVING A PERCENTAGE OR- YOU KNOW ANOTHER OPTION WOULD BE TO ANNOUNCE. CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATE A CERTAIN DOLLAR AMOUNT SET KIND OF WHATEVER THOSE. HIGHEST PRIORITY PROGRAMS ARE LIKE WE'VE DONE WITH- LIKE THE LEGISLATURE IS DONE WITH- FOREST RELATED- ACTIVITIES AND SO THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS TO CONSTRUCT. YOU KNOW HOW TOKIND OF GET THAT REVENUE VOLATILITY AND HOW YOU. CAN MAKE SURE WHATEVER YOUR HIGHEST PRIORITY. TARGETS TO THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT YOU'RE- THAT YOU TO GO TO GO TO THEM- SO I THINK THAT'S JUST KIND OF PART OF THAT BIGGER BROADER CONVERSATION WE'RE HAPPY TO KINDA- YOU KNOW PROVIDE KIND OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. THROUGH WHAT THOSE PRIORITIES ARE AND- HOW YOU WANT TO KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT YOUR HIGHEST PRIORITY PROGRAMS TO KIND OF GET WHATEVER MONEY IS AVAILABLE. YOU YOU ALSO RECOMMEND THAT WE CONSIDER SETTING ASIDE A PORTION OF. THIS FOR A FUNDING FOR- LET'S SEE A REPEAT. TO ALL. FOLKS MAYBE- REDUCTION AND RE. ELECT RAY. WERE SOME TAX- CHANGES. ARE YOU. WE DIRECT. A IS A ABOVE THE LINE IS THERE CAN HIGH PRICES. THE AND TRADE PROGRAM UP TO. SIX SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AT FOLKS YOU CAN BE HIT OR IS WOULD THAT BE. A DISCRETIONARY- ELEMENT THAT WE WOULD FIGHT EACH YEAR WITH THE- ASSEMBLY AND ALSO. THE DEPARTMENT FIGHT. AND HOWARD HOW MUCH IS HOW MUCH IS ENOUGH. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE KIND OF A RECOMMENDATION ON WHETHER IT SHOULD BE CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED OR ARTIST KIND OF DISCRETIONARY. SPENDING PLAN I THINK IN GENERAL AS AN OFFICE- KIND OF PREFER TO HAVE THINGS DONE THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS BECAUSE THAT JUST KIND OF BEEN SHORES. MORE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT- THANK GOODNESS YOU KNOW CAN'T CONTINUE TO KIND OF LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT THAT SORT PARTICULAR MIX OF FUNDING MAKES SENSE BUT- COULD BE DONE THROUGH A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION AS WELL AND I THINK THAT THAT. JUST OVERALL RECOMMENDATION I THINK GETS TO SOME OF SENATOR DOLLIES POINT SURROUNDS- THE HIGH COST OF LIVING AND YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT WAYS WHERE WE CAN KIND OF STRUCTURE THE MIX OF PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE IN A WAY THAT. WAS KIND OF REDUCE EMISSIONS AND DO IT IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY AS WELL AS TRY TO OFFSET SOME OF THE- OTHER COSTS THAT- THAT. HOUSEHOLDS AND BUSINESSES ARE OCCURRING WITHIN KIND OF THE REBATE OR- OR TAX REDUCTION STRATEGY MIGHT BE ONE GOOD WAY TO DO THAT- SHE HAD A CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. I CAN'T SPEAK FOR MY COLLEAGUES BUT I WOULD IMAGINE SOME OF THEM WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE ELECTRICAL BILL SAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED THIS REBATE RATHER THAN THE ENERGY COMMISSION ANNEX C. P. U. C. BUT THAT'S- THAT'S TO BE DETERMINED LATER- OUR STAFF RECOMMENDATION IS TO HOLD THIS MATTER OPEN. WILL CONCLUDEOUR DISCUSSION ON ISSUE NUMBER. TWENTY FIVE MOVED TO ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY SIX THE D. T. S. C. GOVERNANCE AND FISCAL REFORM PROPOSAL. TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY NEW POSITIONS WE DID QUITE A BIT IN THE- BUDGET REFORM SO- GOOD MORNING- DIRECTOR- WILLIAMSON I GUESS CHIEF- DEPUTY DIRECTOR. DEGREE WITH THE TSC- A FINANCING YOU WANT TO START OFF FIRST MISTER AGUILAR AND GO TO. DETAILS HERE. AVERAGE ME. FOR THIS ONE- THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE A THE AGE THANK THERE'S A LOT GET THROUGH. GOOD MORNING ACT HAS. RIGHT MY NAME IS MEREDITH WILLIAMS THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL THANK YOU TO YOU AND TO CENTERS REQUIRE STERN AND DALITS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. THE ITEMS IN OUR BUDGET ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON PROTECTING THOSE COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA TO CARRY A HEAVY ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN. AND ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO POLLUTION. AS YOU WELL KNOW LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED KEY GOVERNANCE AND FISCAL REFORMS TO IMPROVE DGSE TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY AND FISCAL STABILITY. WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE COOPERATIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP THAT WE DEVELOPED WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO PROPOSE REFORMS IN PLACE AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT CORPORATION. AS WE IMPLEMENT THE REFORMS. ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF THE FISCAL REFORM PACKAGE WAS THE RESTRUCTURING AND RESETTING OF THE FEES THAT SUPPORT EACH YES HE'S WORK. THE FEAR IT'S ESTABLISHED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET PROVIDED FOR THE FIRST TIME TO STAY IN A WILL REVENUE FOR DGSE WHILE SUPPORTING INCREASES N OUR SERVICE. THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WILL BUILD ON THAT FOUNDATION BY FILLING GAPS IDENTIFIED IN THE ANALYSIS OF THE WORKLOAD IN OUR THREE PRIMARY PROGRAMS. THAT ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF PRIORITY MANDATES AND ACTIVITIES THAT WERE EITHER UNDERFUNDED OR ENTIRELY ON SUNDAY. THE REFORM PACKAGE SIXTY RATES TO GENERATE AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS TO BEGIN TO PAY FOR INCREASED LEVEL OF SERVICES. CALIFORNIA THE PACKAGE OF BCPS IS CONSISTENT WITH LAST YEAR'S REFORM DISCUSSIONS BCG'S THOSE APPROVED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET AS WELL AS THOSE PROPOSED IN THE GOVERNOR'S TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE JAN TEN BUDGET DOCUMENT HOW DGSE PLANS TO SPEND THE ADDITIONAL REVENUE GENERATED FROM INCREASED FAVORITES. THIS ADDITIONAL REVENUE IS A DOWN PAYMENT ON BETTER PROTECTIONS FOR CALIFORNIA. OF THE FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS A TOTAL OF SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM OUR HAZARDOUS WASTE. CONTROL ACCOUNT AND TWO POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS FROM THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT WERE APPROPRIATED IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. AN ADDITIONAL SIXTEEN POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS FROM H. W. CA M. THIRTY THREE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FROM TOSCA ARE PROPOSED IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. THESE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WILL BE USED TO SUPPORT CRITICAL PROGRAM NEEDS INCLUDING PERMANENT FUNDING FOR THE NEW BOARD OF ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY. EAST ENFORCEMENT AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION ACTIVITIES PARTICULARLY IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES INFORMATION IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR VIOLATIONS SCORING PROCEDURE. FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. INCREASES IN DTS HE'S CRITICAL LEGAL I. T. AND OTHER SUPPORT PROGRAM RESOURCE VITAL TO DELIVERING DGS UNIFORM. PERMANENT FUNDING TO SUPPORT OTHER IMPORTANT ACTIVITIES INITIALLY FUNDED FROM GENERAL FUND LAST YEAR SHE INCLUDING OUR CLEAN UP IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES INITIATIVE AND DEVELOPMENT OF A MODERNIZED HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT. THE CLEAN UP IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES INITIATIVE FUNDING INCLUDES FUNDING TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN CLEANUP ACTIVITIES ON TWENTY TWO OR FRIENDS SIDES WITH A HIGH POTENTIAL FOR RELEASE OF HARMFUL CHEMICALS. THERE IS FUNDING FOR PERMANENT POSITIONS TO SUPPORT AND ONGOING SITE DISCOVERY AND INVESTIGATION PROGRAM AND A GRANT PROGRAM THAT INCENTIVIZES CLEAN UP AND INVESTMENT IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. INITIATIVE FUNDING WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT COMMUNITIES THROUGH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS AND TECH TRAINING AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT. THIS WILL PROVIDE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WITH JOBS TO ASSIST WITH THE CLEANUP AND REDEVELOPMENT OF REMEDIATED SITES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION DEPENDS ON ROBUST PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITIES PLAN FUNDING WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO RE ENVISION HOW WE TACKLE HAZARDOUS WASTE IN CALIFORNIA. THE GENERATION AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTE PRESENTS AN EQUITY ISSUE FOR COMMUNITIES WHERE HAZARDOUS WASTES ARE GENERATED AND FACILITIES ARE OPERATED. THESE RESOURCES WILL YOU WILL BE USED TO CREATE A ROAD MAP FOR REDUCING PERSONAL SOCIETAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS FROM HAZARDOUS WASTE. FOR EACH OF THESE INITIATIVES DGSE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD ON ITS PROGRESS TOWARD GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. WE ARE EXPANDING ON THE PERFORMANCE METRICS TIED TO OUR STRATEGIC PLAN AND ARE DEVELOPING DASHBOARDS AND METRICS THAT WILL TRACK PROGRESS ON THESE INITIATIVES. WE ARE COMMITTED TO HEARING WITH YOU AND OUR OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THE PROGRESS THAT WE'RE MAKING ON THE SPANISH. THIS FUNDING WILL ALLOW US TO PROTECT THE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES TO HER WERE ACCOUNTABLE. WE COUNT ON CONTINUING OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WE WORK TOGETHER SHE PURSUED ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION. CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR FRANCESCA NERI AND I ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT. OKAY THANK YOU WILL- WE'LL GET TO THOSE QUESTIONS LET'S MOVE TO THE LA YOU KNOW YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS. GENERALLY OF. THE LEGISLATION LAST YEAR IN THE B. B. C. P.'S- PROPOSED. YES GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FRANK MENACE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- IN REGARD TO THE PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS HAVE RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED A PACKAGE OF REFORM IMPOSED IMPLEMENTATION PROPOSALS WE FIND THAT THE PROPOSAL'S ALIGNED WITH THE EXPENDITURE PLAN THAT THE APARTMENT PROVIDED LAST YEAR. WHAT'S THE LEGISLATURE USE AS THE BASIS FOR IMPROVING THE GOVERNANCE AND PHYSICAL REFORMS THAT WERE ENACTED LAST YEAR. APPROVING THESE EXPENDITURES WILL BETTER ENABLE THE DEPARTMENT TO ENFORCE HAZARDOUS WASTE LAWS AND NOT REMEDIATE CONTAMINATED SITES THROUGHOUT THE STATE- AS PART OF THIS WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE USED BUDGET INSURE BUDGET HEARINGS TO CONDUCT OVERSIGHT. OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE REFORM PROPOSALS BEING HEARD TODAY TO ENSURE THAT THE DEPARTMENT'S OUTCOMES ARE LEARNING WITH THOSE THAT THE LEGISLATURE. EXPECTED ONE ACTING. THE GOVERNANCE AND PHYSICAL REFORM. I'M FINE DIRECTOR THE LEAD. TRACK BE OUTCOMES REMAINING WORK LOTUS. WITH A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION PROVIDED TO THE APARTMENT LAST YEAR TO ADDRESS BROWN FIELDS- INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS BEING HEARD TODAY ARE THE STAFF NECESSARY TO CARRY OUT THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. SAYS THE DEPARTMENT EXPANDS THIS FUNDING BUT NEED FOR THIS ONGOING STAFF WILL DECREASE IN THE FUTURE- IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO TRACK OUTCOMES BECAUSE AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE- HAVE TO CONSIDER WHETHER TO. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO ADDRESS BROWN BUILDS TO MATCH THE CURRENT ON GOING STAFF THAT'S BEING REQUESTED. REDISTRIBUTE FUNDING BETWEEN STAFF AND- BROWN FILLED ACTIVITIES SO- THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY PROVIDE A MORE DOWNSIZE PROGRAM OR JUST REDIRECT STAFF BINDING TO ANOTHER PRIORITY SO TRACKING THESE OUTCOMES OVER TIME WILL ENABLE THE LEGISLATURE. AND PUT IN A GOOD POSITION TO. MAKE THAT DECISION AS- THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION IS EXPANDED OVER TIME. I'M HAVING TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. I GUESS THE GAME LET'S START OFF WITH THE BROWN FEELS ALTHOUGH I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ON THE- ENHANCING VIRAL PROTECTION FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AS WELL. AS YOUR LEGAL STAFF. SO HELP IS CLEAN- WHAT THE WHAT'S THE GAME PLAN WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF THESE BROWN'S FIELD SITES IN YOU KNOW. WHAT I THINK THE CONCERN IS THAT WE DO FOR REALLY GOOD AND THEIR PRISTINE AND THAT THAT COMMUNITY IS LOVE SAID BUT THE OTHER AREAS DON'T GET THE ATTENTION BECAUSE- THE L. A. TIMES AND PICKED UP AN ARTICLE OF THE CHRONICLES NOT WRITING ABOUT IT WHAT'S YOUR GAME PLAN FOR ALL THE- BROWNFIELD SITES IN THE WORKLOAD WITH THESE SEVENTY SIX SIR. THIRTY NINE PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA BE WORKING THERE WHAT'S WHAT'S- YOUR ONE TWO AND THREE HOW DO YOU EXPECT HOW DO YOU EXPECT TO SPREAD ACROSS THE STATE. I'M GOING TO TAKE THE FIRST PART OF THAT QUESTION AND THEN- PERHAPS FOR INTEREST IN AGREEING CAN ANSWER. THE SECOND PART OF THE QUESTION IN TERMS OF. THE PROCESS OF INDUSTRY YEARS GENERALLY SPEAKING THESE CLEANUPS WILL BE CONDUCTED NO DIFFERENTLY THAN ANY OF OUR COMMUNITY WHICH IS TO SAY THAT WE USE. STANDARDIZE RISK AT RISK ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK CHOI TO DETERMINE WHAT. WHAT LEVEL OF CLEAN UP WOULD PROVIDE ADEQUATE PROTECTION TO THE COMMUNITY- FROM POTENTIAL EXPOSURES TO ANY CONTAMINATION THAT IS THERE SOMETIMES CONTAMINATION IS IN FACT LEFT ON SITE THERE IF THE ROUTES OF EXPOSURE ARE CONTROLLED WELL ENOUGH FOR ELIMINATED- THROUGH THROUGH APPROPRIATE MEANS. SO WITH THAT IN MIND- THERE IS. YOUR POINT IS VERY WELL TAKEN THAT CLEANING UP TO- S. DEGREED WHERE THERE IS ZERO RISK MAY NOT MAKE SENSE OR WOULD NOT MAKE SENSE. IS IT CAME AT THE EXPENSE OF CLEANING UP OTHER SITES WHERE OTHER COMMUNITIES MIGHT BE EXPOSED SO CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF NARAL NEVER DID TALK A BIT ABOUT THE MARKUPS TO WORK OVER THE COMING THREE YEARS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE BEFORE YOU TODAY CHIEF AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR FRANCESCA AND ANGRY SO- WITH APPLICABLE LOCAL COMMUNITIES INITIATIVE RE IN ADDITION TO THE TWENTY TWO SITES THAT WE'VE ALREADY IDENTIFIED- WHERE. WE ARE ENGAGED AND CAN ENGAGE NOW WITH THESE FUNDS IN CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES WE HAVE. YOU KNOW SITE DISCOVERING INVESTIGATION PROGRAM THAT WE'RE GONNA BE TARGETING TOWARD- DRY CLEANERS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD- RELEASES OF CHEMICALS- THROUGHOUT THAT YOU KNOW THE DURATION OF THEIR OPERATION. AND SO AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE DRY CLEANING- SUBSET OF. THE SITE- THAT EXIST THROUGHOUT THE STATE CALIFORNIA'S BECAUSE WE YOU KNOW WE HADN'T INFORMATION ABOUT THE TYPES OF CHEMICALS- THESE DRY CLEANERS HAVE RELEASED OVER YEARS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDING P. C. E. N. T. C. E. AND SO WE'RE GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON A SITE DISCOVERED INVESTIGATION PROGRAM RELATED TO THOSE SITES AND BEING. USED SOME OF THE FUNDS FOR CLEAN UP WHERE WE CAN AND THEN THROUGH OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE IDENTIFY CLEANUP COSTS FOR NOON OR FAN SITE CAN MPL SITES- AND MANAGE THE ONGOING WORKLOAD THAT WAY. SO AND THE ARK WILL BE YOU KNOW TO IMMEDIATELY ENGAGE IN CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES THOSE ORPHANED SITES WE'VE IDENTIFIED AND THEN CONDUCT LIKE DISCOVERING INVESTIGATION FOR. YOU KNOW A SUBSET OF THOSE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND SITES WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. WHERE WE HAVE KNOWN CONTAMINATION WE KNOW- YOU KNOW HOW IT OPERATES HOW IT MIGRATES. AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT TO HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MONITOR IT BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN WE WERE CLEANING UP GASOLINE STATIONS. AND YOU KNOW WE DEALT WITH THE COOPERS AND WE DEALT WITH THE REGIONAL WATER BOARD AND EVERY REGIONAL WATER BOARD HAD A DIFFERENT IDEA YOU COULD HAVE TO GASOLINE STATIONS. ACROSS COUNTY LINE AND ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN. CLEARED THREE YEARS AGO I AND THE OTHER IS STILL TO MINOR AND SEE DOING TO. ON AND ON AND ON AND I WANT TO HARM PEOPLE BUT IT I THINK THAT SUCH WE- A RICHEST. OF HAVING DIFFERENT OUTCOMES WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF WORK AND YOU KNOW IT'S A FULL EMPLOYMENT ACT FOR SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT MONITORING WHICH IS IT'S JUST A DIFFERENT ISSUE BUT WE'RE JUST STARTING ON THIS AND WE'VE GOT LOTS OF. DIFFERENT PROJECTS THAT. EVEN YOU KNOW JUST INITIALLY GETTING THE THAT HAZARDOUS MATERIAL OFF THE SITE AND DISPOSE OF IS A GIGANTIC STEP FORWARD SO- WILL BE PAYING ATTENTION THAT ON ON THE- ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION FOR VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES YEAR I GOT SIXTEEN PERMANENT POSITIONS. CAN YOU SHED SOME LIGHT I MEAN. WHICH COOPER ARE NOT DOING THEIR JOB I MEAN WE'VE STREAMLINED YOUR AGENCY AND WE'VE GIVEN MORE MONEY TO DO THE WORK BUT- WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE EDUCATING THEM AND THE COUNTRY THE BUSINESSES WHO ALREADY. SHOULD KNOW WHAT TOXIC MATERIAL THEY'RE PRODUCING- TELL ME HOW THAT'S GONNA WORK FOR ME NEITHER. THAT SPIRIT HE'S BETWEEN SOME COOPER SAID ARE DOING A GOOD JOB ENFORCING THE CURRENT LAW AND SOME OF THEM. IS IT A- RESOURCE POWER TO DO NOT HAVE THE FULL TO DO WOULD WERE SUGGESTED THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CURRENT. A LOS ARE. THERE ARE THERE ARE A VARIETY OF REASONS WHY- AND- BECAUSE- SOME COMPANIES MAY STRUGGLE WITH DELIVERING- THEIR PROGRAMS AND IT'S DIFFERENT WORLD GROUP HAS HAD DIFFERENT ISSUES AND URBAN COOPER AS- AND SO. YOU KNOW WE ARE RESPONSIBILITIES SHOULD GO OUT AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY- ARE TRAINED TO CONDUCT INSPECTIONS AND GENERATORS AND TO- PROVIDE THEM WITH- THE INFORMATION THEY NEED IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THEIR PROGRAMS WE DID THIS IN CONCERT YOU KNOW THAT THAT- CALIFORNIA BERMAN A PROTECTION AGENCY OVERSEES THE COOPER PROGRAM. SO WE DO THE SAME CONCERT WITH OTHER BOARDS AND OFFICES AND DEPARTMENTS UNDER KELLY PA WE DON'T DO IT YOU KNOW INDEPENDENTLY BUT- THERE IS. THEY ARE- THEY'RE NOT MANDATE IT THERE SO THERE IS A UNIQUE SITUATION OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THEM HAVE A LACK OF RESOURCES AND OTHERS NEED ADDITIONAL TRAINING AND SUPPORT IN ORDER TO SET TO IMPLEMENT THEIR PROGRAMS ACTIVELY. RIGHT IT'S NOT THAT I CAN IF I CAN I MAY I WOULD ADD THAT WE DO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT EVALUATES THE DIFFERENT COMPOSED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO SEE WHICH ONES ARE PERFORMING WHERE THEY'RE JUST FISH AND REALLY GET A BETTER HANDLE ON ANY DISPARITIES AND DIFFERENCES. RIGHT I MEAN THE ACTIONS WE TOOK WORK GOVERNANCE OF THE TSC AND FISCAL REFORM IT WAS IN THE UNDERLYING LAWS STILL BEEN THE SAME SO THE COMPLETE SHOULD BE EITHER ENFORCING THE LAW FOR. YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG. CENTER DOLLY YOUR QUESTION LET ME HELP YOU. SO SOMEBODY FROM A RURAL COUNTY WITH SO YOU DON'T HAVE THE COOPERS DON'T I WAS A CASE OF OUR SIXTEEN YEARS INTO HUGE PROBLEM AND IF YOU'RE IN ALPINE COUNTY. VERSUS SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY YOU YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BUSINESSES TO SPREAD THE COST EVEN HAVE THE REGULATOR IN YOUR COUNTY. AND SO. YOU HAVE TO HAVE ENOUGH BUSINESSES THAT ARE UNDER THAT REGULATION TO HELP PAY THE COST FOR YOUR PERSON THAT EVEN GOES OUT THERE SO THERE'S MANY COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. THAT DON'T HAVE THE VOLUME QUITE FRANKLY NOTS THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE DISPARITIES ON. THE YOU KNOW DIFFERENT PRACTICES BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH BUSINESSES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO SPREAD THAT COST AND THAT'S THAT'S THE STRUGGLE- WITH ONE SIZE FITS ALL LEGISLATION THAT COMES OUT A YEAR OR- MORE REGULATION. ACROSS CALIFORNIA BECAUSE CALIFORNIA IS VERY DIVERSE AND IT AND IT AND DOESN'T ISN'T THE PLAYING FIELDS NOT LEVEL. SO THE SIXTEEN POSITIONS ON THE BCP ARE GOING TO BE SPRINKLED. IN THE OVER WORK AREAS THAT HAVE LOTS OF HAZARDOUS TOXIC. ACTIVITY AND THE- SPARSE AREAS THAT WOULD HAVE MADE SOME TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT DON'T HAVE THE- FROM VOLUMES TO- JUSTIFY. THE EXPENDITURES AT OR AT LEAST A LOOK INTERNAL EXPENDITURES. THAT OVERSIMPLIFICATION NO THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT IT'S TO IS TO STRENGTHEN OUR SUPPORT OF ALL COOPER AS AND SPECIFICALLY TO IT WHICH INCLUDES SENDING A TEAM OF OUR INSPECTORS TO RURAL COULD BEST TO ASSIST WITH- THEIR INSPECTIONS YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE COUPLES HAVE- DISSENTERS POINT HAVING ONE PERSON MANAGING THE ENTIRE PROGRAM. AND SO YOU KNOW WE SPENT TIME ON PROVIDING TRAINING CONDUCTING INSPECTIONS WALKING- BUT DOING IT SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE COOPER INSPECTORS AND I'M PROVIDING THAT GENERAL SUPPORT AND- INFORMATION ABOUT THE HAZARDOUS WASTE CONTROL LAWS THAT THEY NEED TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT OUR PROGRAM. OKAY I KNOW IT'S A THE- JURISDICTION WE'LL TALK WITH THEM- WHEN THEY WHEN THEY COME UP ON MAYBE THERE IS A NEED FOR. GOVERNANCE CHANGE IS HOW THE COOPERS ARE ORGANIZED TO MAKE SURE THEY DO THEIR WORK THE MISSION CHARGE WHAT'S GOING TO THE P. C. P. TWENTY FOR PERMANENT POSITIONS FOR ILLEGAL STAFF. AND I KNOW WE HAVE. I WANT TO BRING UP A SORE SUBJECT BUT I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN SENT BILLS THAT THEY OWE MONEY TO T. T. S. C. AND THEY WERE NEVER COLLECTED FOR. YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS IS. THIS ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE THESE PEOPLE GOING TO BE DOING. MMHM DEBT COLLECTING OR THEY COULD BE. ASSISTING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IF THERE'S A SUIT. OR ARE THEY GOING TO BE GOING- TO. THE AT THE TRIAL TO BE A- EXPERTS WHAT IS THE OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL WITH ANTI TO SEE WHAT'S THE EXPANSION GOING TO BE LOOKING LIKE. I WOULD SAY THAT. THIS REFLECTS THE IMPORTANCE WE PLACE ON ENFORCEMENT AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AND THAT- SH AND THAT ARE ARE REGULATED COMMUNITY STAYS IN COMPLIANCE AND THAT'S BEEN A AN EMPHASIS FOR THE FOR THIS ADMINISTRATION AND SECRETARY. SH I YOU NAMED QUITE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT REQUIRE LEGAL LEGAL EXPERTISE AND LEGAL RESOURCES AND SO THERE'S NO ONE SIMPLE ANSWER TO WHAT THEY'LL BE DOING BUT- YOU KNOW WE DO WE HAVE. WE HAVE A SENSE OF URGENCY ABOUT DOING MORE ENFORCEMENT WORK MORE INSPECTION WORK IN OUR- LOCAL pGOING TO REQUIRE MORE ON. MORE RESOURCES WE HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING OUR VIOLATIONS SCORING PROCEDURES. PROCEDURE WHICH HAS LED TO QUITE A NUMBER OF LEGAL ACTIONS- AND THERE MAY BE CASES WHERE OUR LEGAL STAFF TAKES ON A MATTER INDEPENDENTLY VERSUS WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE IT'S QUITE A VARIETY- CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING TO THAT I THINK YOU'RE I THINK YOU'RE PRIMARILY COVERED IT WHEN WE HAD CONVERSATIONS WITH- YOUR TEAMS LAST YEAR ABOUT THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN YOU KNOW OUR ENFORCEMENT PRESENCE AND DISPOSE THAT'S JUST PART OF THE CALCULUS IN PART OF- YOU KNOW THAT- THAT A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE FEES WOULD COVER I'M TO TAKE MORE TIMELY- ENFORCEMENT ACTION REQUIRES YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE GOAL SUPPORT AND ENGAGEMENT SO. SO SOME OF THOSE WERE- YOU KNOW POSITIONS ABSOLUTELY WILL BE TO- SUPPORT- AGENT'S OFFICE AND ADDITION TO YOU KNOW ALL THE OTHER- PROGRAMMATIC. REFORM THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE YOU KNOW THEY'LL THEY'LL NEED SOME ADDITIONAL- LEGAL SUPPORT AS WELL AS AN EXAMPLE- YOU KNOW IF WE IF WE- CONDUCT ADDITIONAL TRANSPORTER INSPECTIONS AND WE TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTION OR IF WE CONDUCT. ADDITIONAL GENERATOR INSPECTIONS FOR THAT- AND ENHANCING ENVIRONMENTAL- AND PROTECTION OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THOSE LEAD TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS THAT REQUIRE LEGAL SUPPORT SO CROSS THE BOARD YOU KNOW OUR INTENT IS TO STRENGTHEN OUR ENFORCEMENT- ACTIVITIES. AND JUST TO REALLY. WHAT A FINE POINT ON IT BUT IF WE IN THE PAST AS WE DONE TRANSPORTER INSPECTIONS WE SEEN A VIOLATION RATE THAT'S SOMETIMES AS HIGH AS 70% IT'S THE NORMAL SWING HIGH AND SO IT'S INEVITABLE THAT THERE WILL BE ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS REQUIRED AS A RESULT OF INCREASING THOSE INSPECTIONS. I WILL ALSO JUST SAY YOU YOU BROUGHT UP COST RECOVERY AND- COST RECOVERY STILL CONTINUES TO BE A PRIORITY FOR US AS WE- AND AT A DOZEN TALES SOME VERY COMPLEX LEGAL. ANALYSIS AND- LEGAL RESOURCE. I DON'T WANT TO OVERSIMPLIFY UPDATED MISTER DALI BUT YOU HAVE THE INSPECTOR GOES OUT THE INSPECTOR SAYS SHE DID THIS THIS THIS THIS WRONG. THEN LEGAL WITH FOLLOW UP YOU KNOW AND SAYING OKAY HAVE YOU DONE THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS AND THIS THIS THIS AND THIS AND STAY ON OF AND YOU'VE GOT TO FIND IT YOU GOT TO PAY. AND PAY THE FINE AND SORT OF COMPLETE THE- TRANSPORTATION INSPECTION AND HAZARDOUS WASTE INSPECTION. WHAT DO YOU SEE THE LEGAL TEAM GOING IN THERE WITH THAT. THE TALENTED GOD CHEMICAL PERSON HAZARDOUS WASTE PERCENT IDENTIFYING WHAT THE VIOLATIONS HAVE BEEN. I DON'T THINK OUR LEGAL STAFF DOESN'T GO ON THE INSPECTIONS- IN SPECTOR'S DO THAT THEY HAVE THE EXPERTISE THEY COLLECT THE INFORMATION AND DOCUMENTED IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS THE ENFORCEMENT PROCESS BUT BACK SAID OUR LITTLE TEAM REALLY IS VERY INTEGRAL AND INVOLVED WITH OUR- CAREENING INTERNS- TEAM EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. IN THE SENSE THAT THEY YOU KNOW AS WE DOCUMENT THE VIOLATIONS. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE TRYING THOSE VIOLATIONS TO THAT TO THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE AND- ON MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE- YOU KNOW WHO BASIS FOR OUR- OUR VIOLATIONS IS CONSISTENT WITH- YOU KNOW DID IT HAS GOOD STRONG LEGAL. DEFENSE ABILITY AND THEN AS WE MOVE FURTHER AND FURTHER IN THE PROCESS THE BURDEN ON OUR- OUR OFFICE OF LEGAL COUNSEL BECOMES MORE AND MORE- PRONOUNCED HAND SO THEY END UP TAKING MORE MORE. WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THE ENFORCEMENT'S WHETHER THAT'S- LITIGATION. DEVELOPMENT OF ORDERS- SOMETIMES SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS BASED ON SOME VIOLATIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE MAY HAVE SOUND AGAINST A CORNER. BUT ARE THE ONLY. I A REALLY MINERAL IN THIS PART OF THE YOUR OPERATION. SIMPLY BECAUSE BUT CALIFORNIA ARE ILLEGAL AND- YOU KNOW WE YOU EVEN FOCUSING I THINK MAINLY ON PERMITTED BUSINESSES BUSINESSES A GAS STATION OR A- SOMEBODY WHO MANUFACTURES OR THE COOPER'S RAINBOW BUT HOW DO YOU- YOU KNOW I THINK THE BIGGEST ENVIRONMENTAL THE TRAGEDY WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS THE POLLUTION OF OUR WATERSHEDS IN OUR IN THE ILLEGAL GROWS ARE HUGE IN CALIFORNIA SO WHAT. WE'RE WHERE DO YOU WAY AND HOW DO YOU WORK WITH THE AG'S OFFICE OR D YOU WORK WITH THE AG'S OFFICE ON GOING OUT TO THESE BUSINESSES THAT RE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING ILLEGAL BUSINESS OUT THERE THAT ARE AREN'T IN THE PERMITTED PROCESS AND LEGAL I MEAN THE FRUSTRATION I THINK THAT WE SEE IS A YOU KNOW A BY A FARMER SO I'M REGULATED BY. DEPARTMENT TOXIC SUBSTANCE I I'M MEETING DO HAMMERED ON YOU KNOW REGULATIONS AND REPORTING AND YOU KNOW UPSTREAM FOR ME THERE ARE MARIJUANA GROWS THAT ARE DUMPING ALL KINDS OF STUFF ON THE GROUND USING ALL KINDS OF CHEMICALS AND THERE'S- NO KNOWN FORSMAN AND NO WAITED LIKE RAIN THURMOND AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY YOU KNOW DOING A LOT OF DAMAGE TO OUR ENVIRONMENT. REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR THIS ISSUE IS CONCERNED WE HAVE BEEN BROUGHT IN. TO PARTNER WITH. THE WATER BOARD OR THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE- FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN ON SPECIFIC CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES AND ENFORCEMENT WE DO NOT HAVE A SYSTEMATIC. EFFORT TO ON TO LOOK AT MARIJUANA GROWS NOR DO WE HAVE AN EFFORT TO REALLY ANALYZE THE BOYER. WHAT BUSINESSES ARE FOLLOWING FALLING UNDER REGULATIONS THAT COULD BE CREATING POLLUTION I THINK. ON THE AMERICAN MARIJUANA ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROWS. IS A VERY POWERFUL EXAMPLE BUT I THINK THERE ARE OTHER SECTORS OUT THERE THAT SIMILARLY HAVE- ARE A FLYING UNDER THE RADAR. WITH RESPECT TO- NOT BEING REGULATED AND HAVING IMPACTS NOT JUST ON COMMUNITIES BUT ON OTHER BUSINESSES- AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THAT. LEVEL PLAYING FIELD SOMEHOW. IN NEW. YOU'RE RAISING A VERY POINT THAT- WE'RE HAPPY GIVES ADDITIONAL CONCERT. ABOUT INTO THE FUTURE I DON'T KNOW SHE DOESN'T AND FEEL FREE TO ASK. YOU KNOW I THINK YOU'VE COVERED A- DOCTOR AND SO YOU KNOW WE DO WORK WITH LOCAL FOR AGENTS- OFFICE OF CRIMINAL. PARTNERS WITH LOCAL ON AGENCIES ONE- SITUATION BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION AND WE BRING OUR EXPERTISE TO- THOSE TYPES OF CASES BUT YOU'RE YOU'RE BRINGING UP A VERY GOOD POINT THAT THERE'S A YOU KNOW A LARGER ISSUE- THAT WE DON'T HAVE THIS YOU KNOW AND A COMPREHENSIVE- STRATEGY TO ADDRESS. THAT MEASURE JUST FOLLOW UP BY I'M REALLY FOCUSED IN ON THE STORY I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIANS AREN'T REALLY AWARE OF IN ITS IT'S- TRAGEDY- SO DOES THE EIGHT. I THINK THE EIGHT SO AGAIN AT. YEAH HERE WE AWARE THOSE MOST OF THESE ARE. RURAL COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE A LOT OF- ENFORCING PEOPLE THE LOCAL SHERIFF IS TAXED WITH. A LOT OF THINGS AND DOESN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES DOES IT AND WE'VE BEEN PUSHING ON- LEASES THAT. THE FOLKS IN THE NORTH STATE THAT ARE I THINK. WE'VE BEEN PUSHING FOR THE AG TO GET MORE INVOLVED OR AND BRING SOME RESOURCES ACTUALLY TO HELP OUT. BUT DO YOU CAN EVEN COMMUNICATE WITH THE AG'S OFFICE AT ALL. ON THE ON THESE ISSUES. WE COMMUNICATE WITH THE AG'S OFFICE WHEN THERE IS A CASE WHERE- WENDY TSC IS BROUGHT IN TO ASSIST LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION INTO. ILLEGAL ACTIVITY WE PERFORM. YOU KNOW- A ROLE CERTAINLY IN THAT INVESTIGATION AND WE WOULD THEN ENGAGE WITH THE AG AS APPROPRIATE- YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON THE CASE AND WHO'S HANDLING THE CASE AND ALL OF THAT SO- SO IN THAT SENSE WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS BUT THE NGOS OFFICE- BUT I THINK. TO YOUR POINT THERE IS YOU KNOW THERE ISN'T A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY AND- THAT TEACHES HE IS PARTICIPATING IN. TO DO WITH THE SPECIFIC CONCERNS. WITH THIS SPECIFIC CONCERN AND SOME OF. SOME OF THE PROBLEM ALSO- HAS TO DO WITH WHERE THE YOU KNOW EAGLE ILLEGAL GROW IS LOCATED SOME OF THESE ILLEGAL GROWS ARE ON. LANCE'S AN EXAMPLE INTO SOMETIMES OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS ARE CALLING US. AND TO HIS CHEST ON OCCASION SO IT'S- IN ORDER TO A VERY CALM- PROBLEM AND WE REALLY ARE. YOU BRINGING UP. THANK YOU. WORKING BETTER BROWN FEELS THE L. A. O. PRODU THAT THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S IN THERE IS GOING TO LAST ABOUT FIVE YEARS AND THEN. PRESUMABLY WILL HAVE CLEANED UP SITES IN THE APPROPRIATION ARE NECESSARY MONEY WILL GO DOWN DO YOU AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH THAT- ANALYSIS. YES WE AGREE THAT YOU KNOW WELL FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO JUST AND EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE FOR THE PARTNERSHIP- WITH THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR AND- AND FOR THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO CLEAN UP CONTAMINATED OR TO BEGAN SECOND DESTINATION DISCOVERY ANSWERED- CLEAN UP CONTAMINATION VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES SO AS WE AS WE- AS YOU KNOW I INDICATED EARLIER YOU KNOW AS WE WORK THROUGH THE FUNDS AND CLEAN UP SOME SITES AND USE SOME OF THOSE FUNDS FOR SITE INVESTIGATION DISCOVERY. WE WILL BE- COMMUNICATING COSTS RELATED TO CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES TO THE LEGISLATURE IN OUR ANNUAL- AND PL AND ORGAN SITE- REPORT SO- TO THE L. A. AS POINT OVER TIME AS WE IDENTIFY THOSE COSTS YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT PROPOSING- WHAT THE FUNDING SOURCES WILL BE FOR CLEAN UP ACTIVITIES IN THOSE AREAS BUT WE WILL BE COMMUNICATING TO THE LEGISLATURE- WHAT THOSE COSTS WILL BE TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DISCOVER THEM TO THAT- TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SITE DISCOVERING IMPLEMENTATION. SCIENTISTS AND INVESTIGATION PROGRAM. FOR ME BECAUSE ONE THINGS THEY SUGGEST THAT WE DO AN OVERSIGHT HEARING IT'S A POPULAR THING FOR PEOPLE TO SUGGEST THAT WE DO OVERSIGHT HEARING CENTER CAN APPEAL HERE IS THAT ALL THE MONEY OUT. I AM SOMEBODY DOESN'T TELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE AN OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY HEARING. DO YOU THINK THAT WE CAN INTEGRATE THAT YOU KNOW HOW MANY SITES THEY ARE HOW MUCH WORK HAS BEEN DONE INTO THE TO THE NORMAL WORK LOAD- THAT WHEN YOU COME UP BUT GIVEN THAT TO THE BEST THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. RATHER THAN HAVING A SEPARATE. ANALYSIS OF THAT THAT THAT BE AND- INTO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING THESE ARE THE SITES THAT WE COMPLETED THIS IS THE- YOU KNOW AVERAGE TIME YEAH THE DATA THAT THE INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE. OKAY FORGET ALL RIGHT THAT'S ALL I HAVE ON MY- BLESSED THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL CONCLUDE THAT STAFFER CONDITIONS TO HOLD OPEN ITEM NUMBER TWENTY SIX AND WITH THAT WE WILL CLOSE AT THANK YOU AND MOVE ON BRING BACK THE AIR BOARD AND A WEE HOT THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT ON GOVERNOR'S BCPS ON RACIAL EQUITY PROPOSAL. AND I HAVE. CHEVELLE FLETCHER THE EXECUTIVE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OVER CARDS. GOOD MORNING OUR STATE FINANCE WANTS TO DO A PRESENTATION. MISTER MERRETT DO YOU HAVE A PRESENTATION OR- MISS FLETCHER. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO. KICK IT OVER TO THE DEPARTMENT OKAY FORGET GO AHEAD PROCEED. I CAN HEAR YOUR MUTE. THERE WE GO BUDGET YELLOW FILLING ACCESS LIKE IS IN THESE DAYS ALSO WEDNESDAY GOOD MORNING AGAIN GERMAN LIKE CASKEY AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS JANELLE FLETCHER MEMBER DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT OUR PROPOSAL TO OPERATIONALIZE RACIAL EQUITY. THE CARD IS REQUESTING ONE POINT EIGHT FOUR SEVEN MILLION AN ONGOING FUNDS TO CREATE AN OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY FOR MANY OF US TWENTY TWENTY WAS A YEAR OF RECKONING WITH THE REALITY OF RACISM PARTICULARLY ANTI BLACK RACISM IN OUR COUNTRY. DESPITE THE FACT THAT FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ENGAGED IN DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES SUCH AS REDLINING WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO LOW INCOME CANADIANS COLOR BEING DISPROPORTIONATELY EXPOSED TO HIGHER LEVELSOF AIR POLLUTION THIS TYPE OF STRUCTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL RACISM IS SOMETHING THAT MANY OF US DID NOT TALK ABOUT MUCH LESS ORGANIZED TO THIS DENTAL IN OUR OWN POLICIES IN OUR OWN INSTITUTIONS. FOR CARPET THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY AND A LETTER FROM BLACK EMPLOYEES SHOWED US THAT WE NEEDED TO ACT AND IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY OUR BOARD SIGNED A RESOLUTION TO THIS RESOLUTION TWENTY THIRTY THREE DIRECTING CARD TO ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY TO COORDINATE WITH OUR OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND ARE DIVERSE IN. RACIAL EQUITY TASK FORCE. AND COMMUNITY OF ITS FORMS WITH IN CAR. SERVICE OFFICE ONCE CREATE WILL- OVERSEE ALL OF CARBS AFTER TO ADDRESS RACIAL EQUITY. IN ITS PROGRAMS POLICY AND RIGHT. IT WILL HELP OPERATIONALIZE AND IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES THE BOARD DIRECTED THE ORGANIZATION TO MAKE. THE FOLLOWING INCLUDES-DEVELOPING A RACIAL EQUITY LINES FOR ALL OF OUR REGULATIONS AND POLICIES. BUT INCLUDES CREATING BOTH FORMAL SPACES SUCH AS TRAINING AS WELL AS INFORMAL SPACES JUST EIGHTY GROUPS. TO ENSURE THAT CARP STAFF REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE TO LEAVE WITH REYES TO ADDRESS THE NECKLACE. IT WILL ALSO BE CRUCIAL FOR THIS OFFICE TO PARTNER CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITIES DEVELOP CLEAR GOALS AROUND RACIAL EQUITY AS WELL AS METRICS. TO ASSESS AND MONITOR PROGRESS. ARBUS COMMITTED TO REDUCE THE- EXPOSURE TO AIR. AND RESULTING IMPACTS AND DISADVANTAGED. AND LOW INCOME OF CALIFORNIA THAT CONTINUE TO DISPROPORTIONATELY SUFFER FROM HISTORIC ENVIRONMENTAL RACIST AND OTHER SOCIAL BURDENS. KRISHNAMACHARYA SAYS VITAL FOR US STOCKS ALLIANCES COMMITMENT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. GUESSED THE IN OUR STAFF REPORT. CHALLENGES THE AIRPORT ON ONE. THE PER OF THE PROGRAM BE INCORPORATED INTO THE PROGRAMS ANY ORGANIZATION SAID EXISTS WITHIN FIFTY EIGHT WE HAVE. THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION WITH EXECUTIVE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE YOU HAVE THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENT WHICH- JUSTICE. YOU HAVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE TASK FORCE THE COORDINATES COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF EPA YEP THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PROGRAM WHICH COVERS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. DESIGNATED IN THE CAL SCREEN AND HAVE THE CALIFORNIA JUSTICE AND RACIAL EQUITY A PROGRAM WITHIN EPA ON THE PROGRAM PRINCIPLES OF FAIRNESS AND- THE CALLS FOR YOU KNOW. OUR FAIRNESS REGARDLESS OF RACE COLOR AND- WHEN CHRIS COLOR NATIONAL ORIGIN SO YES WE ALL AGREED THAT THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES WELL AWARE THAT WHY A NEW OFFICE WHY NOT SHE IS INTEGRATED INTO. THE. ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE OFFICES THAT WE HAVE ALREADY PUT IN CARP. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND SO I THINK I WOULD I WOULD CLARIFY SOME OF THOSE POINTS I THINK SOME OF THOSE OFFICES THAT WERE REFERENCED ARE NOT WITHIN CARP RIGHT SOME OF THOSE OFFICES ARE WITHIN THE CALIPARI GA AND SO I THINK WHAT WE DO HAVE WITHIN CARP RIDES WE HAVE THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND- WHAT WE HOPE TO CREATE AS THE OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY. AND SO PART OF I THINK WHAT IS SO IMPORTANT AND SO VITAL AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS IS REALLY THINKING ABOUT AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE TRUSTING IN RESPONDING TO THE COMMUNITIES OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS I THINK MANY OF YOU PROBABLY HAVE HEARD FROM I THINK MEMBERS OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT HAVE REALLY CALLED OUT CARBON SAID. QUITE EXPLICITLY YOU KNOW WE WANT TO SEE WHAT KERR WAS DOING ON RACIAL EQUITY WEAKNESS FROM OUR OWN YOU KNOW LETTERS BACK PLEASE AS WELL THAT'S ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS WORK WE'RE TALKING THAT THIS EFFORT OF COURSE IT'S DEFINITELY GONNA WORK CLOSELY WITH I THINK HOW THE PA OF THE OFFICES THAT THEY HAVE CREATED. BUT IT'S REALLY MEANT TO FOCUS ON WHEN WE ARE CARP DEVELOPING OUR REGULATIONS ARE POLICIES WHAT PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITIES HOW ARE WE DOING THAT IN A WAY WHERE WE ARE DISMANTLING AND READING OUT I THINK I'M PRACTICES THAT I JUST MENTIONED AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING RACE AND RACISM IN ALL ITS FORMS. AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT THIS TO NEED ADDITIVES AND I THINK I CAN GIVE AND I THINK THE CRIME AND I THINK AS YOU ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGED RIGHT. WE NEED THIS KIND OF TYPES OF OFFICES MUZAFFER X. MORE THAN EVER IF WE REALLY ARE GOING TO BE SERIOUS ABOUT RACISM AND REALLY ADDRESSING IT WITHIN OUR OWN INSTITUTIONS BUT WHAT WHAT DO YOU DO DIFFERENTLY I MEAN YOU HAVE WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES THEY HAVE TWENTY SEVEN. OR THE AGENCY THE SECRETARY OF NATURAL RESOURCES THEY HAVE TWENTY SEVEN DIFFERENT AGENCIES THAT GO ON WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICE OF EQUITY RACIAL EQUITY IN EACH OF THE DEPARTMENTS WE HAVE THE RESOURCE AGENCY HAS SAID DAVE. DEREK AND CONTROL OF ALL THE AGENCIES YOU GUYS ARE UNDER EPA I MEAN ARE THESE- AS THE SECRETARY THIRTY AS A CHARGE TO YOU SINCE YOU KNOW THE ENVIRONMENTAL RACIAL JUSTICE EQUITY PROGRAM THAT HE HAS OF HIS. IF HE WHY WOULD YOU I GUESS GUESS IF. A NEED. WHY WOULD YOU NOT TO HELP SERVICE PROVIDE TO CAL RECITE. WHICH ALSO UNDER CAL WHY WOULD YOU JUST SAY ONLY. GETS THIS. SIR IF IT'S AN IN. SERVE RATHER THAN. THE WHOLE. AGENCY IF THAT'S A GOAL. I MEAN I DON'T SPEAK FOR EVERY AGENCY BUT WHAT I WILL SAY- AND HOPEFULLY THIS IS NOT AN HONEST ANSWER I WOULD SAY ONE AYE AYE. I BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW CARVE AS A ARE RULES ARE RULES TO IMPLEMENT RIGHT AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON I THINK WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND I WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT I DO THINK THAT WE NEED OFFICE IS A RACIAL EQUITY ACROSS THE BOARD AND THAT MEANS THAT I THINK YOU KNOW WE DO A HAVE KELLY K. NOT COORDINATING ROLE BUT- I WOULD SAY THAT WE ALL OF THE DOUBTS SOMEONE THAT'S LOOKING AT. AND ASSESSING AND MAKING SURE THAT THE POLICIES AND THE PROGRAMS THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE COMING OUT ARE ACTUALLY ADDRESSING AND THINKING THROUGH THE IMPACT THEY'RE HAVING ON COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT RACIAL LINES AND RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE IT I THINK THAT'S WHAT COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN PUSHING AND CALLING OUT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING I THINK YOU KNOW OUR NATIONAL LEVEL WE'RE SEEING AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL AND WE'RE SEEING IT RIGHT NOW EVEN LOCALLY. AND SO THE MORE THAT I THINK WE CAN BE RESPONSIVE THE MORE THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW IF WE IF WE DON'T HAVE A FOCUSED RIGHT NOW WHO IS GOING TO FOCUS ON IT RIGHT NOBODY AND THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS IS SO IMPORTANT I WILL ALSO JUST KIND OF PLAYING OUT THAT RIGHT NOW OUR CURRENT YOU KNOW OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IS HONESTLY UNDER RESOURCE. AND OVERSTAFFED AND THAT IS REALLY AT THE TYPICAL OF MOST ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PROGRAMS SO THIS REALLY WOULD BE I THINK IN SOME WAYS A HUGE A MODEL FOR OTHER DEPARTMENTS OTHER AGENCIES ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE SEEING I THINK THE RECEPTIVENESS AND THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LEGISLATURE BIKE WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THE SUPPORT GROUP WE WANT TO SUPPORT THIS ONLY WANT TO SEE OTHERS FALL. THIS MODEL AS WELL. AND YOU DON'T THINK THAT THE- ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE. WHICH IS POSTED- IT RACIAL EQUITY AND TO TRY AND CHOSE IN A JUDY HEATING. AND FOR OUT REACH AND INFORM PARTNERSHIP GREEK BUILDING IS IN THE ATTIC TO DO WHAT. I THINK I WOULD SAY THAT. THE MORE RESOURCES THAT WE CAN DEVOTE TO THIS THE BETTER I WOULD SAY THAT I THINK OF SOME GREAT LIKE SO I DO OVERSEE THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A STAFF OF FIVE PEOPLE FOR AGENCY OF SEVENTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE SUIT JUST TO PUT THAT IN THE CONTEXT RIGHT I MEAN THAT IS. YOU'RE ASKING LIKE FIVE SIX PEOPLE TO LOOK AT OPTIONS AND THE THINK ABOUT HOW I THINK SEVENTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE ARE REALLY INCORPORATING IN ADDRESSING BOTH OF OUR MAIL JUSTICE AND RACIAL EQUITY AND ALL THOSE THINGS ARE CORRELATED RIGHT THEY'RE NOT THE SAME THING- THAT IS A BIG ASK AND SO I THINK PART OF WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THINK IT'S FOR P. Y. I'M NOT EVEN PROBABLY HONESTLY IN THE LAST. BUT IT WILL REALLY HLP AND I THINK SUPPORT AND AMPLIFY THIS OFFER OKAY I MEAN WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE SPENDING 35% OF OUR OUR CAP AND TRADE FUNDS INVESTED OR AND CARPENTERS TO CATCH COMMUNITIES WERE SPENDING OVER FIFTY SO. IT'S SORT OF IMPLICIT IN THAT IS THAT WE'RE DOING MORE THAN WHAT WE'RE REQUIRED TO DO BY LAW BUT. WE HAVE CENTER DOLLY HAS A QUESTION. PERSONAL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR- PRESENT TODAY I'M VERY VOTE IN ON THIS AREA AND I THAT TOM HILTON THE CENTER OF HOUSE CURATOR IS PRODUCTS. SOME POINTS BUT- SOME I'VE BEEN TRACKING IS GOES AND- WHAT COMMUNITIES IT GOES TO. AND YOU KNOW THERE WAS SOME STUDIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE- IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE ON IT SO QUITE FRANKLY JUST JUST BECAUSE- IF YOU FOLLOW THE MONEY LET'S JUST PUT IT THIS WAY IF YOU FOLLOW THE MONEY MOST OF THE MONEY WENT TO. PLACES LIKE THE BAY AREA. MOST THE MAJORITY OF MONEY ONE OF THE BAY AREA VERSUS PLACES LIKE. FRESNO AND SALINAS AND PLACES WHERE WE HAVE LIKE REALLY. A HIGHER CONCENTRATION OF POLLUTION AND THOSE COMMUNITIES ARE ALL UP FOR AND SO I WILL MY QUESTION TO YOU IS- WHAT WHAT IS THE WHAT'S THE PLAN HOW ARE YOU GOING TO THE MALL A- GAUGE IT AND HOW ARE YOU WHAT WHAT IS THE OUTCOMES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR OBVIOUSLY- WE WANT TO SEE. A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- HAVE THE SAME EQUAL FOOTING AS OTHER COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE AND IT'S QUITE FRANKLY NOT THAT WAY- IN ALL GIVEN EXAMPLE IS A LOT OF IT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE WAS YOU KNOW MANY TAX CREDITS GIVEN OUT FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES. AND WE SAW THE MOST THOSE TAX CREDITS GO TO WEALTHIER PEOPLE THAT COULD AFFORD TO BUY- DESERVES LUXURY VEHICLES AND THE POOR PEOPLE DIDN'T SO MUCH. AND THE REASON BEING IS THAT. WEALTHY PEOPLE CAN AFFORD THOSE KIND OF CARS AND THEY HAD THE ACCESS TO CHARGING STATIONS AND OTHER THINGS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THAT- MANY FOLKS IN THE- IN THE MORE POOR COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA WERE ABLE TO- TAKE TAKE THAT THE SAME. OPPORTUNITY SO CAN YOU KIND OF GIVE ME A LIKE A LAYOUT PLAN WHAT WHAT YOU THINK THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE IN THIS AREA. ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK I'M IN TERMS OF LIKE THE FUNDING ALLOCATIONS RIGHT ALL ALL TO FORGET TO DO I FIND THAT BUT I ACTUALLY. COMPLETELY AGREE SENATOR WITH I THINK WE ARE ASSESSMENT IS RIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- ZADZIM TALKING ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE SEEING AND I THINK WE HEAR FROM THE COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW. IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW HOW OR IF THE FORD ABILITY RIGHT SORT OF LED AND ACCESSIBILITY I THINK ARE KEY POINTS I KNOW THAT WHEN I AM. A FELLOW DEPUTY CRACK ALSO ABOUT THOSE PLANS AS WELL SO THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY ABSOLUTELY WHAT WE WANT TO SEE WHAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT. IS HOW ARE WE MAKING SURE AS THESE POLICIES ARE ROLLING OUT RIGHTS AS WE'RE GETTING KIND OF LIKE THESE- THESE CLEAR MANDATES AROUND STATUS AND WHAT WE WANT TO SEE HAPPEN. HOW ARE WE MAKING SURE THAT THOSE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT ARE KIND OF FUN CENTER RECEIVING THOSE BENEFITS AND THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY REDUCING THE BURDENS AROUND LIKE ACCESS AND COST AFFORDABILITY FOR THEM. AND SO TO ME PART OF WHAT'S BEAUTIFUL ABOUT HOW TO GET OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY WITH AND CARP WHICH IS THAT WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY AND WE ARE MAKING SURE THAT THE POLICIES ARE BEING DEVELOPED WE REALLY DO YOU HAVE THAT RACIAL EQUITY LANDS RIGHT WE'RE LOOKING AT. IMPACTS LOOKING AT BURDENS WILL GET UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES I WOULD BE ON TOP OF THAT WE REALLY DO HAVE A ROBUST COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT PROCESS WHERE I THINK YOU KNOW OUR OUR STAFF ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITIES TO SHAPE AND DEVELOP THESE. AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THAT THAT'S NOT HAPPENING RIGHT NOW BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THE OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY WHAT IT REALLY DOES IS REALLY HELP TO KIND OF REALLY FOCUSING THOSE EFFORTS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A CLEAR. TRANSPARENT PROCESS BUT I THINK YOU KNOW SENATORS HERE AS WELL AS COMMUNITIES CAN UNDERSTAND IN TRACK AND SEE. EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE DOING ON THAT FRONT. WELL I WILL BE. FOLLOW THIS VERY CLOSELY. SOME I'M DEFINITELY PASSIONATE. IN THE BILITY TO BE ABLE TO- TRACTOR FOR. AND WHO. AND THERE'S TWO WAY TO LOOK. IT EITHER. YOU KNOW IT THE COST OF LIVING IS SKYROCKETING CALIFORNIA PEOPLE ACTUALLY IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO THOSE JUST OF ENGINEERS ARE PAYING. 60% HIGHER. ELECTRICITY RATES IS SOMETHING I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. AND ALSO PAYING. A LOT MORE FOR THEIR FUEL- AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE INCOME. THAT OTHER P. SOME OTHER PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE THAT ARE BENEFITING. AND SO. THESE PROGRAMS ALL OF WHAT WE DO IT. AT CAL IN THE LEADING CALIFORNIA IN THE WORLD IN CLIMATE CHANGE DRIVE UP THE COST OF LIVING. FOR DISADVANTAGED FOLKS NOW SOME PEOPLE THAT ARE WEALTHY CAN OFFSET THAT AND THEY CAN LIVE IN CALIFORNIA THEY FEEL GOOD ABOUT. YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE HEADED WITH THE CLIMATE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IF WE- ARE NOT TAKING A CLOSE LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY. TO THE- LOW INCOME AND THE MIDDLE CLASS FOLKS. THAT HAVE TO QUITE FRANKLY COMMUTE FURTHER TO THEIR JOBS. AND LIVE IN POOR COMMUNITIES- THAT'S NOT FAIR AND THEY'RE GETTING THEY'RE PAYING THE BILL NOT MAY BE DIRECTLY- BUT THEY'RE PAINTED INDIRECTLY THROUGH. THE REGULATIONS THAT DRIVE UP THE COST OF LIVING AND SO- I'M THIS IS AN AREA THAT I THINK IS. NOT THE TRUTH IS NOT REALLY LAID OUT VERY. MAINLY IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT. WHO'S PAYING AND WHOSE BENEFITING. AND THE NUMBERS THAT WE'VE SEEN OR THE WEALTHY ARE BENEFITING MORE THAN THE THAN A NON WEALTHY- AND SO I JUST AND WOULD WANT TO SAY TO YOU THAT TIME THIS IS MERRY I THINK THAT. THAT NEEDS DAYLIGHT A LOT OF DAYLIGHT AND- I'M GONNA BE FONG NECESSARY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S- NOT FAIR IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE PEOPLE THAT. ARE ACROSS THE BOARD PAYING THE BILL AND NOT GETTING THE BANDAGE OF. THE PERKS THAT COME OUT OF THE LEGISLATURE AND IN REWARDS TO GETTING. US GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WITH CLIMATE. OKAY I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER HANDS I GUESS. I WANTED WHICH WE'RE GOING TO HOLD THIS MATTER I GUESS ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WORK TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT EARLIER TODAY ON ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY FIVE WE HAD CAP AND TRADE AND WE HAD CLEAN CARS FOR ALL. CLEANS CARPETS FOR ALL WE PUT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION IN FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO PROTECT THAT ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE RACIAL EQUITY RIGHT THE ADMINISTRATION'S ASKING FOR SEVENTY SIX MILLION MORE ON TOP OF THAT FOR THIS PROGRAM. IS THE OFFICE OF IS THE OFFICE THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING IS THAT GOING TO MONITOR THAT IS OR SOMETHING OUR PEOPLE THE PICK THE PARTICIPANTS ARE YOU SOON ARE MEET ALL THE CATEGORY RIGHT THE ARE LOW INCOME THEY- THERE LIVE IN A NON. AREA ECCENTRICS YOU SEE THAT THIS OFFICE SOMEHOW GOING TO MONITOR. THE OTHER. ALL THE PRO. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING IT RIGHT. IF I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I HATE THAT I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION SENATOR ARE YOU ASKING ME. IN RELATION TO I THINK THAT- THE CAP AND TRADE B. C. Q. THAT WE SHARED ARE YOU ASKING ME IF THE OFFICE OF RACIAL LIKELY WE WILL BE MONITORING. THE ACTIVITIES THAT WE OUTLINED IN THE CAP AND TRADE B. C. P. MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY BEING EQUITABLE. RABY YOU'RE THE SUGGESTION AS WE NEED THIS NEW PROGRAM TO OPERATIONALIZE RACIAL EQUITY SO WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT'S ALREADY DESIGNED FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE DISADVANTAGED MANY RACIAL EQUITY WITHIN WITHIN KERR. SAID THERE COULD BE THE VANCE RACIAL EQUITY EFFORTS HOW WOULD BE A SYSTEM THAT WE ALREADY HAVE THE PROGRAM JUST IT'S JUST PICKING THAT PROGRAM. IF THE CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH. OR THERE'S A QUALITY. I'M SO SORRY I THINK I CAN WITH WHICH I'M SO SORRY WHICH PROGRAM THIS IS CLEAN CARS FOR ALL. CREEK CLEAN CARS FALL CALPERS FOR ALL TO BE GENERATED IT'S RUN BY CAR IT'S ONLY A LIMITED GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT PARTICIPATE IN IT WHAT WOULD THIS. ADDITIONAL MONITORING THAT CAR. NOT NOT DEALING WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL THE EPA MONITORING HOW IT IS HERE IT LEVEL OF REDUNDANCY I GUESS I'M- ASKING. GASTAUT I GOT IT SORRY ABOUT THAT THAT WAS HELPFUL SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WOULD PROBABLY JUST KIND OF THAT TO UNDERSCORE IS THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY FOR US IT'S MUCH BIGGER RATE THAN JUST THE G. CARE ACT PROGRAMS AND- AND SO YOU KNOW YES YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT WE DO HAVE A YOU KNOW CLEAN CARS FOR ALL. AND THERE IS THAT PROGRAM WE HAVE OTHER PROGRAMS WITH THEM LIKE RIGHT THE TEACHER OF THE WEEK WE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE HAVE EIGHTY SIX DEGREES WE HAVE THESE PROGRAMS THAT ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON AND THINKING ABOUT EQUITY AND HOW DO WE OPERATIONALIZE THAT- MORE TALKING ABOUT THE OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY WE REALLY DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT'S MUCH BIGGER AND MUCH LARGER IN SCOPE. ONLY THINK ABOUT IT AS A PLACE WHERE WE REALLY ARE THINKING ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR RANKS ABOUT MID OF OUR POLICIES OUR SHIPPING OUR OWN CULTURE INTERNALLY WITH OUR STAFF OUR BUILDING THAT COMPETENCY AND UNDERSTANDING AROUND RACIAL EQUITY AND HOW WE'RE PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITIES AND SO I THINK THAT IN SOME WAYS I WOULD SAY IT'S JUST. DIFFERENT THAN TO WHAT WE'RE DOING I THINK IN TERMS OF THE G. CARE ACT BECAUSE YES RIGHT THERE IS A POINT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WITH- YEAH OFFICE RACIAL EQUITY BEING VERY TRANSPARENT AND CLEAR AND HOW WE GET CARP ARE ASSESSING FOR RACIAL EQUITY WITHIN OUR REGULATIONS ON WITHIN OUR PROGRAMS AND THAT WILL LEAD TO KIND OF GREATER TRANSPARENCY I THINK RIGHT NOW BUT THE LEGISLATURE FOR COMMUNITIES. AND I THINK IT'S MUCH QUICKER AND THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW ARE WE DEVELOPING OUR RAGS HOW ARE WE THINKING ABOUT FROM THE FRONT AND ABOUT BURDENS CONSEQUENTLY UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IMPACTS. THOSE PIECES RIGHT I THINK BY DOING THAT WORK RIGHT THAT'S ALSO GOING TO GRADUATION I COULD BE THINKING ABOUT OUR STAFF MAKING ABOUT PEOPLE THAT WERE% BREAK AGAIN AND HOW REBUILDING A CULTURE WHERE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TO BE A GREAT RACE THESE ARE HISTORIC INEQUITIES THAT OUR OWN COUNTRY HAS A PICTURE HIT IT RIGHT AT ITS STATE LEVEL FEDERAL LEVEL. AT A LOWER LEVEL AND WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE DISPENSED BY AS A COVER AGENCY I THINK I'M TO KIND OF PAINT THE PICTURE OF IS THAT YES ABSOLUTELY BECAUSE THAT THE PROJECT THAT WE HAVE A MOST AND THAT FOR US THIS IS A FAR AWAY. IN SCOPE AND REALLY KIND OF COST YOU A LOT OF LIKE I SAID THE RESTRUCTURING WE'VE SEEN THAT HAPPENING AT THE NATIONAL. LEVEL AND HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM THE OFFICE OF AND FOR. JUSTICE DPA. BECAUSE AGAIN YOU'VE GOT. AB SIX ONE SEVEN WE GOT WE'RE GOING. WE'RE DOING SURE READ WITH THE CAN. WERE TO CA. CAN THEIR INPUT. HE TRANSFORM CLIMATE. OF VISIBILITY. CHARETTE THAT WERE. OUT TO TALK WITH COMPARE AND FORTH. AND IT SEEMS AS THOUGH. AT LEAST PEOPLE. ARE HAPPY. THOSE I MEAN. WHETHER SPENDING ENOUGH MONEY OR- THAT. SHE COME OUT AND- GIGI ARE F. IS A DIFFERENT. BUT THE OFFICE OF AN- JUSTICE. WHY CAN'T THEY DO THAT WHY IS THAT WHAT WILL BE DIFFERENT I GUESS. RIGHT IT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO I THINK I'M AND I'LL I'LL SAY REALLY GREAT SO I CAN'T SPEAK. LAST WEEK THAT TENANTS ARE COMING COMMUNITIES LETTER OR ORDER TO CUT DOWN- AND I ALLOCATE DOES HAVE ITS OWN ENVIRONMENT JUSTICE FOR BUT I CAN SPEAK TO I THINK OFFICE BAYERN JUSTICE KERR. OR SOMETHING THAT I DO I OVER- AND WE I WOULD SAY IS EXACTLY POINT FOR YOUR SAYING RIGHT ARE WITH THAT THERE HAVE WITH THE EFFORTS THAT WERE DEALING. AT THE SAME TIME. I'LL COMMITTEE CAN A THAT POINT THAT HAVING PEOPLE FOR A STAFF OF SEVENTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE FOCUS ON ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HEARING AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND ADDRESSED ME WHY CASE IN POINT. THOSE FIVE STAFF BETWEEN EMAIL AND BASICALLY LIKE BEING A KIND OF CONVENER FOR EIGHTY THIRTY TO ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVISORY COMMITTEE RETURNING ARE KIND OF COMMUNITY AIRCRAFT PROGRAM BETWEEN KIND OF OVERSEEING OUR BORDER EFFORTS AT CARP. AND THEN I THINK NOW CLEARLY OUR TRIBAL EFFORTS AS WELL I MEAN THAT RIGHT THERE ALONE TAKES UP. A LOT OF THE WORK THAT OUR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE YOU KNOW TEAM IS DOING AND I THINK ON TOP OF THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING OUT COMMUNITIES KIND OF LIKE THINKING ABOUT HOW WE'RE BUILDING UP RELATIONSHIPS HAVING TOWARDS. SO PART OF WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THE OFFICE OF RACIAL EQUITY TO DO AGAIN I THINK IT'S REALLY ADDED AFTER WHAT YOU ARE SHARED. IS REALLY THINK ABOUT COMPREHENSIVELY HOW ARE WE ANALYZING ASSESSING. RACIAL EQUITY WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE IT WHAT DOES IT MEAN OVERTOPPING OUR RAGS TO ACTUALLY THINK THROUGH THE IMPACT FROM THE BURDENS AT THE FRONT END WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO HAVE CLEAR METRICS CLEAR GOALS AROUND HERE IS WHAT WE ARE CARP. ARE GOING TO DO YOUR EQUITY THIS IS OUR KIND OF OUR PLAN HERE THE MEASURE THAT YOU CAN TRACK AND WAS LOOK LIKE FOR US TO KIND OF CONTINUALLY UPDATE BUT THE COMMAND WHICH LATER ON NOT. AND SO I CAN'T I REALLY DO YOU SEE THIS IS REALLY ADDITIVE TO WORK THAT WERE ALREADY DOING BOTH IN OUR PROGRAMS AND WITH OUR OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL. IN TERMS OF REALLY MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE REALLY ROOTING OUT I THINK EMBRACES AGAIN LIKE IN ALL ITS FORMS I THINK I'D MENTIONED A LETTER FROM BLACK EMPLOYEES. ALL JUST REINFORCE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT OTHER. RIGHT EVEN WHAT IT FEELS LIKE INTERNAL. AND SOME FOR BLACK EMPLOYEES RIGHT THE ONES THAT WERE THAT LETTER. AND OF WHAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH RIGHT SUCH LIKE. YOU TO HAVE THAT KIND OF. OFF OF RACIAL I. IT DOESN'T AT BOTH THE IN. AND THE X. AND THAT TO ME IS OUT OF THE- ALL BUT YOU'VE ALREADY SHE CONDITION THIS WHOLE THIS MATTER OPEN. WE HOLD IT OPEN BE TALK. WITH YOUTH YOU FOR THE- THAT'S- CONCLUDES. NUMBER TWO- SEVEN GO TO. ISSUE NUMBER TWO. EIGHT AND THIS IS THAT THE- OF RE. FOR AND RECOVERY- I IN KNOW THAT. AND WE HAVE. DIRECTOR WAGNER GOOD MORNING I KNOW THAT THAT. WE'RE ONLY GOOD AT DISCUSS THE- ARE BIODEGRADABLE PRODUCT LABELING HIM IMPLEMENTATION EVITA. AT TWELVE OH ONE I KNOW SENATOR STERN WHO IS LEFT THAT DAY HAS HAD SOME QUESTIONS ON- FIRE- WORK THAT'S DONE AT ON SITE SAID HE WANT TO ASK IN A DIRECT WHERE WAGNER WHILE I HAVE YOU HERE I JUST WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. DECIDED TO FIRE HIM FOR STUFF THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONSTERNATION ABOUT THE BOTTLE BILL THE VERY LARGE SURPLUS IN THE BEVERAGE CONTAINER- OF FUN AS NOTED IN THE SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE A RECENT. ARTICLE I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT- RIGHT NOW IS NOT THE RIGHT TIME TO DO THIS INQUIRIES SO- I'M GONNA LOOK FOR TO AGO PRESENTED IN A LETTER TO YOU SEE YOU KNOW THAT IT'S WORTH COMING I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR RESPONSE. AND I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT LEAVE IT AT THAT FOR TODAY- BUT LET'S GET INTO. PRODUCT LABELING REQUIREMENTS AND BIODEGRADABLE- PROGRAM YOU'RE ASKING FOR- ONE BABIES. ONE B. C. P.

THANKS SENATOR AND JUST OPEN AND% BASS OF COURSE I AM HAPPY TO AND TALK TO YEAR- AND SOME MEMBERS SAID THE BUDGET COMMITTEE ABOUT- OUR BEVERAGE CONTAINER RECYCLING PROGRAM- OUR WELFARE PROGRAM AND ALL OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT CAN RECYCLE AND AS YOU WOULD LIKE SO I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT ISSUE TODAY HAPPY TO DO THAT IN WRITING WHATEVER IS MOST CONVENIENT FOR YOU OR ANSWER QUESTIONS TODAY IF YOU HAVE THEM. AND WE HAVE SEEN ONE AND PROPOSAL FOR YOU TODAY I IS FOR ONE Q. Y. DATA IMPLEMENT AB TWELVE A WINE ADDED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM AS YOU KNOW THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT YOU ALL AND THEY DID ON LAST YEAR IT GOES TO THE CONFIDENCE IN CALIFORNIA. AND UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS GOING TO FALL AND GOES HAND IN HAND WITH OUR SENATOR ALLEN SPELL ENTREES AND LABELING ON WHAT IS RECYCLABLE AN INDUSTRY WHERE IT REALLY DOES SEEM THE WORKLOAD ON EACH SIDE OF THE LINE. ZERO DO YOU OVERSIGHT OF THE FEASIBILITY STUDY- THAT IS YOUR QUESTION AB TWELVE OH ONE ON AND ON AND ADVICE FOR CHANGING THE WAY STRAIN BUT MORE OVER TO DO THE RESEARCH THE OVERSIGHT AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. I'M TO YOUR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND OUR OTHER STAKEHOLDERS AND TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT AS WE ARE DOING CONTEMPLATION OF COMPOSED ABILITY AGAIN AND AS WE DO ON YOU KNOW. ON AND ADDRESS REALLY REGULAR BASIS I THINK WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION OVER THE LAST DECADE A COUPLE OF TIMES WE MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THIS INFORMATION RIGHT AND THAT WE ARE I'M CONTINUOUSLY UPDATING THAT INFORMATION AND UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACTS ON- COMPOSTING WHICH AS WE ALL KNOW IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE IS GOING TO BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT THAT WE STREAM. IS CLEAN AND THAT OUR COMPOST OR CRYING PROVIDING TO- PRIMARILY TO OUR AGRICULTURAL. PARTNERS JEAN AND THE COMPANIES THAT WE ARE YOU. AND IS FREE OF CAN. AND SO WE THINK THAT THIS LEGISLATION WAS I'M REALLY. AND INCREASED THE LEAD. LEADERSHIP AND IN PASSING THIS LET. I THAT THE I OPPOSITION AT YOUR- FROM RCI C. OVER THE C. C. WAS MORE A MYSTERY. OR MISS AT. BETWEEN ITS- AND ARE C. R. C. OVER WHAT OUR RATE. AUTHORITY IS AND I KNOW THAT MEMBER TEAMS FAR WITH CLEAN UP MY- THIS YEAR. THE CTA'S REFER. WHAT THE- SAYS- BUT OF COURSE OUR INTENTION IS TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS AROUND LABELING. AND TO BE VERY INTENSE AND OF THE LEGISLATURE AND OF THE AUTHOR I'M TO HAVE THOSE REGULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LABELING. I'M NOT CREATING A NEW BIFURCATED SYSTEM AND AS THAT IS NOT THE AND THE INTENSE AS. COMMUNICATED BY THE LEGISLATURE THAT AND- BUT JUST SEEING WHAT WE WILL WE WHAT WE PASS SELECTED OKAY SO WE WERE OBVIOUSLY WERE HOLDING THIS OPEN TO DEAL WITH THE INCONSISTENCY AND I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO SEE IF THIS ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING IS ACTUALLY PUT A BILL ACROSS THE- ACROSS THE DESK YET- THANK YOU FOR THAT EXPLANATION- THE L. A. O. DO WE HAVE A COMMENT. BOB ROSS BROWN AGAIN WITH THE L. A. O. IS YOUR AGENDA NOTES AND AS DIRECTOR OF WAGNER MENTIONED WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S ONGOING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT. IN THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT KIND OF CLARIFYING THE INTENT OF THE BILL AND THAT IT WOULD ONLY IS FOR THE TRUST PRODUCT LABELING AND NOT NECESSARILY A BIFURCATED COLLECTION SYSTEM SO. WE'RE USING IT MAKES SENSE TO WITHHOLD ACTION ON THIS FOR NOW TO ALLOW TIME TO SORT OUT. IF WE COULD ONLY IMPROVE THE SEPARATION AND SORTING OF ALL OUR WASTE IN OUR RECYCLABLES AND ORGANICS AND- IT'LL PUT OF TRUMP COULD THROW INTO EDUCATING THE PUBLIC IN. WHAT TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS AND WHAT'S WHAT IS RECYCLABLE WHAT'S% NOT RESPECTFUL BUT- THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE BEFORE US- OKAY. IF I COULD JUST SAY THAT REGARDLESS OF THAT REGULATORY AND ACTION THAT MAY BE TAKEN BY THE DEPARTMENT THE WORKLOAD AND THEN THEY NEED FOR THE P. Y. WILL BE NECESSARY FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LEGISLATION REGARDLESS OF THE REGULATIONS. SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT NOTE IS PART OF YOUR CONCERTS. AND IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTISTS. LOOKING FOR WORK. MAYBE THERE ARE. OKAY I DON'T SEE ANY MEMBERS HAVING ANY QUESTIONS THAT'S ALL I HAD I JUST WANTED.
