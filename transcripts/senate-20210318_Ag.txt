ARE WILL NOT BRING DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS ON COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS. INQUIRIES YEAH WE HAVE A MOTION OF THE BILL I DO HAVE A- AND THAT WAS BY SENATOR CAFIERO I SAW THAT. YOU GET THE HANG OF THIS NOW- I THINK I JUST WANTED TO ASK- HIM WE AT THERE SEEMS TO BE A TREND- NOT JUST WITH THIS COMMISSIONER THAT BOARD BUT ACROSS ON THE ENTIRE LANDSCAPE THAT LEGISLATORS AND COMMUNITY FOLKS ARE WE SHOULD HAVE MORE REPRESENTATION PUBLIC REPRESENTATION ON THESE BOARDS- IN I KIND OF WANTED TO FIGURE OUT. SO THIS WOULD GO FROM WHAT DO YOU SAY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN. YES AND ONE TO TWO I WANTED TO PUBLIC MEMBERS ON THE OVERALL MEMBERSHIP- PUBLIC WOULD STILL BE OUTVOTED BY ABOUT SIX BUCKS. OKAY NOW THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO THE HAVE TO HAVE ANY QUALIFICATIONS AND- EDUCATIONAL OR PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND TO BE APPOINTED TO THE PEST CONTROL BOARD AS A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC NOT CALLED OUT IN IN THE EXISTING STATURE AND IT'S NOT CALLED OUT IN THE BILL. THIS IS ONE OF THE ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE IS- I DO WANT. I DO WANT PUBLIC PARTICIPATION HìNH I ENCOURAGE IT. I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THOSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE A BACKGROUND THAT IS. APPROPRIATE FOR. THE COMMISSION OR BOARDS JURISDICTION- HE HAS THERE BEEN ANY ISSUE THAT. WE WERE NOT AWARE OF THAT NECESSITATES THE EXPANSION FROM ONE TO TWO PUBLIC MEMBERS YES THERE BEEN SO MANY DEFERRED PAST ISSUES FROM AROUND THE STATE WHEN YOU HAVE A STATE OF ALMOST FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. AND AS YOU SAID IN YOUR OPENING COMMENTS THE LARGEST AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY AMONG THE FIFTY STATES IT'S HARD TO PICK ONE PERSON FROM ONE PART OF THE STATE AND BRING THE FULL. OP BOB PANOPLY OF WHAT THE ISSUES ARE TO THE GROUP AND SO. THIS WOULD ALLOW SOMEBODY FROM. THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND MAY BE FROM THE CENTRAL COAST OR MAYBE FROM NAPA SONOMA COUNTY DOES WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE DIFFERENT INTERESTS AND DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS IN AGRICULTURE TO BRING THAT TO THIS COMMITTEE. DO YOU CONSIDER DIVIDING UP ON THE STATE TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL THAT YOU WOULD HAVE. PERHAPS SOMEONE FROM THE U. S. RESOURCES SECRETARY I INHERITED A LOT OF LAWS LIKE THAT THEY WERE NIGHTMARES. BECAUSE THERE WERE GENERALLY. ARE EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE FROM ONE AREA THAT WANT TO PARTICIPATE AND NONE FROM THE OTHER AND YOU WERE ALWAYS HAMPERED IN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO SO THAT'S. WHY I THINK THERE'S SOME FLEXIBILITY. GETTING BACK TO THAT MY FINAL PATTERN THAT COMMENT WILL DRAW. FORMER SECRETARY CA CRAZY BECAUSE HA HA HA OUR SYSTEM THE OTHER EVERY BILL WAS ABOUT RESOURCES SOME HALF HEARTED WEALTH ARMAMENTS GONNA MAKE A FRIENDLY- RECOMMENDATION FOR YOU TO CONSIDER OBVIOUSLY- NOT HERE NOW BUT MOVE AS THIS PROCESS MOVES FORWARD. WOULD YOU CONSIDER. ADDING SOME INSTRUCTIONAL LANGUAGE THE BILL THAT- THIS ADDITIONAL POSITION ARE THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL HAVE SOME BACKGROUND IN A RELEVANT FIELD. BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN SOME BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS IS THAT THE MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC- IS COMING IN FRESH WITHOUT CONTEXT WERE ANY INSIGHTS INTO THE INDUSTRY OR COMPLICATIONS THAT CAN BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY THEIR DECISIONS- I THINK THAT'S GOOD GOVERNMENT FROM MY STANDPOINT. I WOULD JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER THAT. SO ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION- BY SENATOR CAFIERO TO MOVE THE BILL- CENTER WHICH LIKE TO A CLOSE FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALL RIGHT- THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED- BUT FIRST THE MAN IN RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS- CONSULTANT CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FOR CENTER BURGESS HI WE'RE JUST OUTSIDE HER TADO I'M RETIRED OF AYE CABALLERO HI. FEBRUARY EIGHTH. EGGMAN AYE GLAZER AYE THESE ARE HIGH ARE A BILL OUT WITH FIVE LINES. THANK YOU MISS REGULATIONS HELLO FORWARD TO THE NEXT TO IT OR- OF THIS BILL. OUR NEXT BILL IS FILE ITEM NUMBER FIVE SB FIVE FOUR SEVEN OR BY OUR OWN SENATOR GLAZERS. CENTER GLAZER I THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. AND MEMBERS. YOU SHOULD THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT SB FIVE FORTY SEVENTY TODAY THIS THIS BILL WOULD GIVE CALIFORNIA A WORLD CLASS VETERINARY EMERGENCY TEAM. TO HELP THE STATE PREPARE FOR DISASTERS AND RESPOND TO THEM AND THEN THE FIRST THANK- MY GIANT MIGHT CO AUTHORS. HERE ON THE PANEL SENATOR PORGES CABALLERO AND HER TADO AND ALSO SENATOR DIED NIELSEN AND WILK. SAVING THE LIVES OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS AND LIVESTOCK IS A WORTHY MISSION IN ITSELF. BUT THIS BILL IS ABOUT MORE THAN THAT. FIRST RESPONDERS KNOW THAT PEOPLE WITH ANIMALS ARE LESS LIKELY TO EVACUATE IN A DISASTER UNLESS THEY KNOW THAT THEIR ANIMALS WILL BE SAFE. THIS PUTS THE RESIDENTS IN GREATER DANGER. AND MAKES THE JOB OF FIRST RESPONDERS- EVEN TOUGHER AS PEOPLE REMAIN BEHIND FIRE LINES OR OTHERWISE IN HARM'S WAY. THE STATE'S PROGRAM FOR EVACUATING AND CARING FOR ANIMALS IN DISASTERS IS KNOWN AS CARES AND HAS STRUGGLED FOR AT LEAST A DECADE. AT TIMES IT HAS BEEN OVERWHELMED. TO THEIR CREDIT THE NEWSOME ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CAT CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE HAVE ADDED MORE RESOURCES AND FOCUS TO THE PROGRAM. IT GAPS STILL REMAIN TWICE IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS HAD TO CALL ON A VETERINARY EMERGENCY TEAM FROM TEXAS A AND M. UNIVERSITY TO HELP CARE FOR OUR ANIMALS WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE THEIR AID BUT CALIFORNIA CAN AND SHOULD FIELD ITS OWN MOBILE VETERINARY TEAM CAPABLE OF RESPONDING ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. THE UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE IS KNOWN AND RESPECTED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. IT'S A PERFECT PLACE TO HOST SUCH A TEAM. DURING DISASTERS THIS TEAM WOULD ROLL OUT WITH MOBILE CLINICS STAFFED BY VETERINARIANS AND STUDENTS TO HELP LOCAL AGENCIES THAT REQUEST ASSISTANCE. THEIR WORK WILL BE COORDINATED THROUGH A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH CDFA AND THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. TO ENSURE THE LINES OF AUTHORITY OR CLEAR. BETWEEN DISASTERS THE PROGRAM WILL CONDUCT RESEARCH AND TRAINING BOTH OF FUTURE VETS. AND VOLUNTEERS FROM AROUND THE STATE. THE PROGRAM WOULD ALSO BE A BOON TO THE SCHOOLS EXISTING SHELTER MEDICINE PROGRAM AND WOULD BE INCORPORATED INTO CURRICULUM FOCUSED ON EMERGENCY MEDICINE. MEMBERS AS WE HAVE SEEN CALIFORNIA IS PRONE TO DISASTERS THE REASON WILDFIRES HAVE BEEN CATASTROPHIC AND ARE GETTING WORSE. BUT CERTAINLY FLOODS AND EARTHQUAKES ARE ALSO LIKELY UNFORTUNATELY. LIKELY IN OUR FUTURE WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREPARE THIS PROGRAM WILL PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN THAT PREPARATION AND INTERVENTIONAL RESPONSE.

KERR A VETERINARIAN- FROM MY DISTRICT WHO HAS VAST EXPERIENCE WITH THIS TYPE OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR CONSIDERATION.

MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS WE ARE PLEASED TO BE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE RESPONDING TO NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS THE WILD FIRES WE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED. OUR PRIMARY CONCERN FIREFIGHTERS ON THE SCENE IN THE PRESERVATION OF HUMAN LIFE- NEED EFFORTS TO PRESERVE LIFE RATED THROUGH EVACUATION WARNINGS AND ORDERS WHICH ARE CRITICAL TO ENSURE THAT OUR CREWS CAN CHECK. IF THEIR EFFORTS ON PROTECTING PROPERTY AND SUPPRESSING FIRE RATHER THAN ENGAGING IN DANGEROUS RESCUE EFFORTS. HOWEVER WE KNOW. WHAT REDUCE WILDFIRE THAT SHOWN THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO FOLLOW EVACUATION ORDERS WHEN THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE WELFARE OF THEIR DOMESTIC AND LYFT ANIMALS AND LIVESTOCK I'M NOT VERY MUCH COMPLICATES THE WORK OF FIREFIGHTERS WHO ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO HANDLE. LARGE ANIMALS. WELL SB FIVE FORTY SEVEN PROVIDE. ADDITIONAL SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT TO ENSURE THE CALIFORNIANS HE'D EVACUATION ORDERS AND HEAD TO SAFETY SO THE FIREFIGHTERS CAN BATTLE THESE BLAZES.
