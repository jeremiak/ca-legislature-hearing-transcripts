01:22:08.623 --> 01:22:09.891
MANY OF THESE COMPOUNDS ARE

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.660
KNOWN TO BE TOXIC TO HUMAN

01:22:11.726 --> 01:22:13.862
HEALTH CARCINOGENIC CAUSE

01:22:13.928 --> 01:22:15.196
RESPIRATORY HARM.

01:22:15.263 --> 01:22:16.731
OR OUR ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING

01:22:16.798 --> 01:22:18.833
CHEMICALS MEETING THE ALTER THE

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:20.835
BODY'S HORMONE SYSTEM AT VERY

01:22:20.902 --> 01:22:22.470
LOW LEVELS OF EXPOSURE WHICH

01:22:22.537 --> 01:22:25.006
CAUSES LONG TERM DEVELOPMENTAL

01:22:25.073 --> 01:22:26.341
OR REPRODUCTIVE HARM.

01:22:26.408 --> 01:22:27.642
WHICH IS A CONSIDERABLE

01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:29.077
CONSIDERATION FOR HEALTH ACROSS

01:22:29.144 --> 01:22:30.145
GENERATIONS.

01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:31.346
THERE'S A GROWING BODY OF

01:22:31.413 --> 01:22:32.781
RESEARCH TO SPEAK TO THE POINT

01:22:32.847 --> 01:22:34.115
HERE TODAY THAT LOOKS AT THE

01:22:34.182 --> 01:22:35.817
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PROXIMITY

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:37.385
OF THESE FACILITIES AND HUMAN

01:22:37.452 --> 01:22:38.286
HEALTH.

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:39.988
MOST OF THESE DISTANCES FURTHER

01:22:40.055 --> 01:22:41.456
AWAY THAN ARE BEING CONSIDERED

01:22:41.523 --> 01:22:42.490
TODAY.

01:22:42.557 --> 01:22:43.958
THE BASIC FINDING FROM THIS

01:22:44.025 --> 01:22:45.126
GROUP OF STUDIES IS THAT

01:22:45.193 --> 01:22:46.828
PROXIMITY MATTER IT'S LIVING

01:22:46.895 --> 01:22:48.697
CLOSER TO AN OIL AND GAS

01:22:48.763 --> 01:22:50.398
DEVELOPMENT SITE IS WORSE FOR

01:22:50.465 --> 01:22:51.466
YOUR HEALTH.

01:22:51.533 --> 01:22:52.867

PREGNANCY AND BIRTH OUTCOMES

01:22:56.604 --> 01:22:57.806
SUCH AS LOW BIRTH WEIGHT AND

01:22:57.872 --> 01:23:00.041

01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:11.486
PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS.

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:13.021
THERE IS ALSO A HIGHER BURDEN OF

01:23:13.088 --> 01:23:15.023
CANCER MORTALITY IN COMMUNITIES

01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:17.359

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:23.598
WORSE.

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:24.666
THE UPSTREAM OIL AND GAS

01:23:24.733 --> 01:23:26.234
INDUSTRY ALSO HAS ONE OF THE

01:23:26.301 --> 01:23:28.503
HIGHEST RATES OF SEVERE INJURIES

01:23:28.570 --> 01:23:29.904
FOR WORKERS IN THE COUNTRY.

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:31.005
THESE AREAMONG OUR COUNTRY'S

01:23:31.072 --> 01:23:32.273

TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

01:23:35.810 --> 01:23:37.212
THESE WORKERS ARE AT HIGH RISK

01:23:37.278 --> 01:23:38.880
FOR BOTH DEADLY ACCIDENTS AND

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:41.082
TOXIC EXPOSURES AND WORKERS HAVE

01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:42.684
BEEN MEASURED WITH HIGHER LEVELS

AND A RANGE OF INJURIES BUT

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:47.555
FURTHER SETBACKS HAVE BEEN SHOWN

01:23:47.622 --> 01:23:48.890
TO BE A MEANINGFUL PUBLIC HEALTH

01:23:48.957 --> 01:23:50.592
POLICY APPROACH TO LIMIT HUMAN

CONTAMINANTS.

01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:54.562
THERE IS MEANINGFUL PRESIDENT

01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:55.897
HERE WHEN THE OVERWHELMING

01:23:55.964 --> 01:23:57.899
SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE HAS POINTED

01:23:57.966 --> 01:23:59.667
TO THE NEED FOR POLICY ACTION.

01:24:02.337 --> 01:24:03.605
EITHER GOOD EXAMPLES WHERE

01:24:03.671 --> 01:24:05.407
POLICYMAKERS TOOK ACTION AND

01:24:05.473 --> 01:24:07.142

EXACTLY HOW EXPOSURE HAPPENS IN

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:18.453
ORDER TO BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.921
THAT THESE HEALTH IMPACTS EXIST.

01:24:19.988 --> 01:24:21.156
THAT'S SOMETHING SCIENTISTS CAN

01:24:21.222 --> 01:24:22.757
POTENTIALLY TEASE OUT BUT WE

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:23.792
ALREADY KNOW THESE HEALTH

01:24:23.858 --> 01:24:25.160
IMPACTS EXIST AND I THINK

01:24:25.226 --> 01:24:26.394
THERE'S ALREADY MORE THAN ENOUGH

01:24:26.461 --> 01:24:27.729
EVIDENCE FOR POLICY MAKERS TO

01:24:27.796 --> 01:24:28.763
TAKE ACTION.

01:40:48.976 --> 01:40:50.344

01:40:50.411 --> 01:40:52.146
IF WE WERE IN A COURT OF LAW.

01:40:52.212 --> 01:40:54.248
I WOULD HAVE TO OBJECT --

01:40:54.314 --> 01:40:55.916
BECAUSE WE'RE ASSUMING FACTS NOT

01:40:55.983 --> 01:40:57.117

01:40:57.184 --> 01:40:58.485

DIRECT STATEMENT.

01:41:00.287 --> 01:41:03.657

IMPACTS -- TO COMMUNITIES.

01:41:08.061 --> 01:41:09.563
AS IF IT'S FACTUAL WHEN IN FACT

01:41:09.630 --> 01:41:11.398
IT IS NOT.

01:41:11.465 --> 01:41:13.734
WHAT I SPENT MY A A SPRING BREAK

01:41:13.801 --> 01:41:17.104
DOING IN -- TO NOT EXACTLY WHAT

01:41:17.171 --> 01:41:18.272
I EXPECTED BUT I READ REPORTS I

01:41:18.338 --> 01:41:19.139
READ THE OIL CHANGE

01:41:19.206 --> 01:41:20.674
INTERNATIONAL REPORT WHICH IS

01:41:20.741 --> 01:41:22.042
THE BASIS FOR THIS BILL.

01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:23.310

HUNDRED FOOT BUFFER.

01:41:25.279 --> 01:41:26.680
A SEARCH THE SAME -- FALSE

01:41:26.747 --> 01:41:28.382
STATEMENTS BUT ACTUALLY DID

01:41:28.449 --> 01:41:29.716
SOMETHING I READ THE REPORT AND

01:41:29.783 --> 01:41:31.752
I READ THE FOOTNOTES BUT I WAS

01:41:31.819 --> 01:41:33.020
TAUGHT TO DO THAT IN LAW SCHOOL.

01:41:33.086 --> 01:41:34.288
I READ THE FOOTNOTES AND THAT

01:41:34.354 --> 01:41:37.024
LED ME TO THE CCSD REPORT PAGE

01:41:37.090 --> 01:41:37.925
CITED.

01:41:37.991 --> 01:41:40.394
THE SPECIFIC PAGE CITED BY THE

01:41:40.461 --> 01:41:41.829
OIL CHANGE INTERNATIONAL REPORT.

01:41:41.895 --> 01:41:43.397
SPECIFICALLY TELLS YOU THAT THE

01:41:43.464 --> 01:41:44.698
FINDINGS DO NOT APPLY TO

01:41:44.765 --> 01:41:46.266

01:41:46.333 --> 01:41:47.634
CALIFORNIA IMPACTS MAY BE

01:41:47.701 --> 01:41:49.670
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BUT HAVE

01:41:49.736 --> 01:41:51.271
NOT BEEN MEASURE.

01:41:51.338 --> 01:41:53.807
SO WE ARE MAKING STATEMENTS AS

01:41:53.874 --> 01:41:56.643
THE AS IF THEY ARE FACT WE ARE

01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:58.078
PROPOSING TO SHUT DOWN.

01:41:58.145 --> 01:41:59.980
THOUSANDS OF WELLS IN CALIFORNIA

01:42:19.066 --> 01:42:20.400
SO I SAID WELL IT'S NOT THE CCS

01:42:20.467 --> 01:42:22.436
T. REPORT BECAUSE THAT CLEARLY

01:42:22.503 --> 01:42:24.805
DOESN'T SAY THAT THERE ARE --

01:42:24.872 --> 01:42:26.940

CLEARLY CONCLUDES.

01:42:37.317 --> 01:42:38.819
THAT THE LITERATURE IS UNABLE TO

01:42:38.886 --> 01:42:40.454

WE CANNOT ACCEPT.

01:43:51.124 --> 01:43:52.793

01:44:06.907 --> 01:44:08.108
LAST POINT?

01:44:08.175 --> 01:44:09.343
WAS THAT THERE WERE CONCERNS

01:44:09.409 --> 01:44:11.211

01:44:22.489 --> 01:44:23.423
THAT IS A SPECIFIC SET OF

01:44:23.490 --> 01:44:25.292

02:16:44.396 --> 02:16:45.430
THING I LEARNED A LAW SCHOOLS

02:16:45.497 --> 02:16:46.998

02:16:55.707 --> 02:16:56.942
SO WITH HIS BILL ONE OF THE

02:16:57.008 --> 02:16:58.410
THINGS THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

02:16:58.476 --> 02:16:59.911
AND THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN.

02:16:59.978 --> 02:17:02.380
WE CAN DISCUSS THAT -- LOOK AT A

02:17:02.447 --> 02:17:03.481
LATER TIME BECAUSE I DO HAVE.

02:17:03.548 --> 02:17:05.250
CONCERNS THAT THIS IS GOING TO

02:17:05.317 --> 02:17:07.485
LIMIT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF IN

02:17:07.552 --> 02:17:09.754

FORWARD IN THE FUTURE A AND

02:17:11.323 --> 02:17:12.924
EQUALLY OUT FOR FOLKS THAT HAVE

02:17:12.991 --> 02:17:14.426
PROPERTY RIGHTS WHERE THEY HAVE

02:17:14.492 --> 02:17:15.560
THE MIDDLE RIGHT.

02:17:15.627 --> 02:17:16.161
THAT'S WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THE

02:17:16.227 --> 02:17:17.862
GROUND THAT WILL ALSO BE A HUGE

02:17:17.929 --> 02:17:19.664
CONCERN SO NOW WE'RE DEALING

02:17:19.731 --> 02:17:21.466
WITH THE PRIVATE PROPERTY ISSUE.

02:17:21.533 --> 02:17:22.901
BUT DOES THIS THING PROGRESSES.

02:17:22.968 --> 02:17:24.369
IT IS FASCINATING THAT

02:17:24.436 --> 02:17:25.370
EVERYTHING THAT WE DO IN THE

02:17:25.437 --> 02:17:26.771
STATE WE TALK ABOUT THE LOAN

02:17:26.838 --> 02:17:28.306
COMMUNICATE WITH LOW INCOME

02:17:28.373 --> 02:17:30.108
COMMUNITY AND ALL THAT WE NEED

02:17:30.175 --> 02:17:30.675
TO DO TO SUPPORT AND PROTECT

02:17:30.742 --> 02:17:32.744
THEM. ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT

02:17:32.811 --> 02:17:34.879
THAT DRIVES UP THE COST AND THE

02:17:34.946 --> 02:17:36.114
COST OF LIVING IN THE STATE IS

02:17:36.181 --> 02:17:37.582
QUITE FRANKLY FOOD THE COST OF

02:17:37.649 --> 02:17:39.784
FOOD THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION.

02:17:39.851 --> 02:17:41.820
SO IF THERE IS ANY ASPECT OF

02:17:41.886 --> 02:17:43.221
THIS BILL THAT LIMITS IN STATE

02:17:43.288 --> 02:17:44.889
OIL PRODUCTION.

02:17:44.956 --> 02:17:46.658
AND DRIVES UP THE COST WILL BE

02:17:46.725 --> 02:17:48.727
TRANSPORTATION OR THE COST TO

02:17:48.793 --> 02:17:50.762
FARM THE COST. TO TO PUT A

02:17:50.829 --> 02:17:51.997
PRODUCT IN THE SUPERMARKET THAT

02:17:56.835 --> 02:17:57.769

AND SO ANYTHING THAT WE DO ON

02:17:58.803 --> 02:17:59.404
THAT -- I AM CONCERNED AS WELL

02:17:59.471 --> 02:18:00.271
AS ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE OF

02:18:00.338 --> 02:18:01.373
IT IF WE SHUT DOWN THE IN STATE

02:18:01.439 --> 02:18:03.008
OIL PRODUCTION WHERE WE GONNA

02:18:03.074 --> 02:18:04.442
SUPPLEMENT THAT FROM.

02:18:04.509 --> 02:18:05.577
IT'S GONNA BE FROM OVER SORT OF

02:18:05.644 --> 02:18:06.645
FOREIGN OIL.

02:18:06.711 --> 02:18:07.812
WE HAVE THE ABILITY IN

02:18:07.879 --> 02:18:09.280
CALIFORNIA THE MOST REGULATED

02:18:09.347 --> 02:18:12.083
OIL INDUSTRY ANY ATTIRE COUNTRY.

02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:13.251
THAT'S THE SAFEST PLACE THAT WE

02:18:13.318 --> 02:18:15.120
CAN GET THIS OIL IS RIGHT HERE

02:18:15.186 --> 02:18:15.654
BELOW US IN THE STATE OF

02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:16.655

TAKE THIS IN MIND WE TALK ABOUT

02:18:20.925 --> 02:18:21.993
THE LOW INCOME COMMUNITY BUT

02:18:22.060 --> 02:18:24.262
LET'S REALLY FOCUS ON WHAT.

02:18:24.329 --> 02:18:25.330
THE ASPECT AND WHAT THIS

02:18:25.397 --> 02:18:27.632
ACTUALLY MEANS BECAUSE IF WE DO

02:18:27.699 --> 02:18:28.667
NOW I PERSONALLY BELIEVE IT'S

02:18:28.733 --> 02:18:30.101
GONNA SHUT DOWN ABOUT 12% OF THE

02:18:30.168 --> 02:18:31.069

02:18:33.304 --> 02:18:34.439
IT'S NUMBER THAT I BELIEVE IN.

02:18:34.506 --> 02:18:36.174
AND IF THAT IS THE CASE.

02:18:36.241 --> 02:18:37.409
WE'RE GONNA SEE A SIGNIFICANT

02:18:37.475 --> 02:18:38.977
COST OF LIVING INCREASE THAT IS

02:18:39.044 --> 02:18:40.345
GOING TO HURT THE LOW INCOME

THERE'S LESS REBATE MONEY TO GO

02:38:28.198 --> 02:38:30.000

02:38:30.067 --> 02:38:32.202
REBATES IN THE PLACES WHERE THE

02:38:32.269 --> 02:38:34.104

THAT HE IS WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE

LESS AFFLUENT.

02:38:39.810 --> 02:38:42.312
AND SO BY HAVING THE INCOME CAP

02:38:42.379 --> 02:38:44.314
WE RESERVE THOSE REBATES FOR THE

02:38:44.381 --> 02:38:45.449
PEOPLE FOR WHOM THEY WILL MAKE

02:38:45.515 --> 02:38:46.550
THE MOST DIFFERENCE.

02:38:46.617 --> 02:38:49.152
AND THAT WAY WE CONTINUE TO

02:38:49.219 --> 02:38:50.520

02:42:00.444 --> 02:42:01.445
TO ACCEPT MOST OF OUR RECYCLED

02:42:01.511 --> 02:42:03.346

WE KNOW THAT'S A PROBLEM NOW

02:42:25.936 --> 02:42:27.838
THERE'S NO MARKET AND SO IT IS

02:42:27.904 --> 02:42:28.972

EXISTING LAW.

03:06:51.233 --> 03:06:53.068
THIS IS A BILL THAT DOES HARDEN

03:06:53.135 --> 03:06:55.437
DOWN THE IDEA THAT THE CPC HAS

03:06:55.504 --> 03:06:58.273
POWER. TO COMPEL PROCUREMENT ON

03:06:58.340 --> 03:07:00.309

03:20:46.300 --> 03:20:47.635
DEVELOPMENT.

03:20:47.702 --> 03:20:49.337
BEING THE OPTIMAL TERM.

03:20:49.404 --> 03:20:50.538
IF WE AREN'T WISELY DEVELOPING

03:20:50.605 --> 03:20:51.973
OIL AND GAS AND THAT'S BEEN

03:20:52.039 --> 03:20:53.541
REMOVED FROM THE BILL THAN WHAT

03:20:53.608 --> 03:20:55.576
WE GOING TO DO IN SO FAR AS

03:20:55.643 --> 03:20:57.245
DEVELOPING FALLING GAS.

03:20:57.311 --> 03:20:58.413
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MEDIAN NEEDS

03:20:58.479 --> 03:21:00.882

03:21:00.948 --> 03:21:02.850

IF THE POLICY IS TO KEEP IT IN

03:21:17.598 --> 03:21:19.133

03:21:19.200 --> 03:21:20.735
CLEAR AND THEN WE CAN HAVE THAT

03:21:20.802 --> 03:21:22.670

03:22:26.267 --> 03:22:26.734
STATUTE.

03:22:26.801 --> 03:22:28.569
I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

03:22:28.636 --> 03:22:29.337
NOTE THAT.

03:22:29.403 --> 03:22:31.272
CALIFORNIA HAS A HISTORY OF

03:22:31.339 --> 03:22:33.241
DEVELOPING ITS.

03:22:33.307 --> 03:22:34.976
HYDROCARBON RESOURCES IT HAS HAD

03:22:35.042 --> 03:22:36.711
A HISTORY AND HAD A GROWTH

03:22:36.777 --> 03:22:39.447
BECAUSE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF

03:22:39.514 --> 03:22:41.883
ITS HYDROCARBON RESOURCES.

03:22:41.949 --> 03:22:43.084
WHEN THIS BILL LANGUAGE IS PUT

03:22:43.150 --> 03:22:44.619
IN STATURE TO WISELY DEVELOP ITS

03:22:44.685 --> 03:22:46.053
RESOURCES?

03:22:46.120 --> 03:22:47.555
A COUPLE THINGS WILL SAID AS WE

03:22:47.622 --> 03:22:48.089

WE BUILT ADEQUATE DUCT WE BUILT

03:22:51.492 --> 03:22:53.361
A HIGHWAY SYSTEM WE DID A LOT OF

03:22:53.427 --> 03:22:55.296
MONUMENTAL THINGS IN CALIFORNIA

03:22:55.363 --> 03:22:56.564
IN A LARGE PART DUE TO THE

03:22:56.631 --> 03:22:58.399
RESOURCES THAT WERE DEVELOPED IN

03:22:58.466 --> 03:22:59.500
STATE.

03:22:59.567 --> 03:23:01.602
SO WE WE APPRECIATE THE IDEA OF

03:23:01.669 --> 03:23:03.037
MODERNIZING OUR STATUTE.

03:23:03.104 --> 03:23:04.305
BUT WE DON'T MODERNIZE BY GOING

03:23:04.372 --> 03:23:05.940
IN AND JUST EXCISING A PIECE OF

03:23:06.007 --> 03:23:06.874
THE STATUE WE DO A BY

03:23:06.941 --> 03:23:08.242
RECOGNIZING.

03:23:08.309 --> 03:23:10.011

STRUCTURE?

03:23:11.045 --> 03:23:12.680
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS.

03:23:12.747 --> 03:23:14.048
THE DEVELOP THE PRODUCTION OF

03:23:14.115 --> 03:23:15.950
OIL AND GAS IS UNDERGONE A

03:23:16.017 --> 03:23:17.418
TREMENDOUS TREMENDOUS --

03:23:17.485 --> 03:23:19.720
RESTRUCTURING.

03:23:19.787 --> 03:23:21.222
MANY OF BILLS THAT YOU ALL VOTED

03:23:21.289 --> 03:23:24.325
FOR SB FOUR SB.

03:23:24.392 --> 03:23:24.926
TWELVE EIGHTY ONE THE PUSH FOR

03:23:24.992 --> 03:23:26.761
THE COMPLETELY RESTRUCTURING OF

03:23:26.827 --> 03:23:27.662
THE UNDERGROUND TRACTION CONTROL

03:23:27.728 --> 03:23:29.630
PROGRAM WE HAVE COMPLETELY

03:23:29.697 --> 03:23:31.999

03:23:33.334 --> 03:23:35.002
YEARS.

03:23:35.069 --> 03:23:36.203
AND THAT'S NOT BECAUSE WE GO

03:23:36.270 --> 03:23:37.405
BACK TO THE DIGITAL OIL AND GAS

03:23:37.471 --> 03:23:40.274
AND AND EXCISE OUT PART OF ITS

03:23:40.341 --> 03:23:41.475
MISSION WE ADD TO THAT WE'VE

03:23:41.542 --> 03:23:43.110
ADDED.

03:23:43.177 --> 03:23:46.047

PROTECTION OF OUR RESOURCES.

03:24:02.063 --> 03:24:03.297
SO IT'S NOT SIMPLY LOOKING AT

03:24:03.364 --> 03:24:05.399
THE DAHLE MANDATE -- THAT WOULD

03:24:05.466 --> 03:24:06.567

WE'VE ADDED AN ENTIRELY NEW

03:24:11.973 --> 03:24:13.874
REGULATORY STRUCTURE ON TOP OF

03:24:32.994 --> 03:24:34.295
HERE YOU'RE GETTING SO MUCH DATA

03:24:34.362 --> 03:24:35.596
ABOUT WHERE YOU TO WHERE YOU

03:24:35.663 --> 03:24:37.431
PRODUCE WHERE THE WATER IS THE

03:24:37.498 --> 03:24:38.099

OF OIL PRODUCTION IS COMPLETELY

03:24:55.983 --> 03:24:56.751

THIS ONE TO GIVE A COUPLE OF

03:34:15.409 --> 03:34:16.543
VERY CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF HOW

03:34:16.610 --> 03:34:18.111
WE'VE GOTTEN TO A PLACE WERE

03:34:18.178 --> 03:34:19.379
REALLY IMPORTANT PIECE OF OB

03:34:19.446 --> 03:34:21.081
LEGISLATION. TO PROTECT THE

03:34:21.148 --> 03:34:22.783
ENVIRONMENT IT CAN OFTEN BE

03:34:22.849 --> 03:34:24.618
WEAPONIZED TO DO ALMOST THE

03:34:24.685 --> 03:34:26.253
EXACT OPPOSITE OF WHAT IT WAS

03:34:26.320 --> 03:34:27.721
MEANT TO DO.

RIGHT SO WE KNOW ON ALMOST EVERY

03:34:30.557 --> 03:34:32.092
EVERY RESPECTFUL ENVIRONMENTAL

03:34:32.159 --> 03:34:34.995
GROUP LOOKS TO SEE WHAT AND SAYS

03:34:35.062 --> 03:34:39.166

MORE URBAN INFILL HOUSE LIKE.

03:34:40.867 --> 03:34:43.203
BUT 87% A SEQUEL LAWSUIT

03:34:43.270 --> 03:34:44.371
LAWSUITS ARE TARGETED AT URBAN

03:34:44.438 --> 03:34:46.173
INFILL HOUSING.

03:34:46.240 --> 03:34:48.809
SO THERE IS THE WEAPONIZATION OF

03:34:48.875 --> 03:34:51.345
MISUSE OF THE C. QUOTE THAT IS

03:34:51.411 --> 03:34:52.779

03:35:03.323 --> 03:35:05.025
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WAY PEOPLE

03:35:05.092 --> 03:35:06.994
BEHAVE ONLINE THEY DON'T HAVE TO

03:35:07.060 --> 03:35:08.295
PUT THEIR NAME ON SOMETHING IT

SAY IN THE SEAPORT PLAN -- THERE

04:31:26.770 --> 04:31:28.472

04:31:28.538 --> 04:31:30.007
WE'VE HAD BILLS LIKE THIS IN THE

04:31:30.073 --> 04:31:31.141
PAST WITH RESPECT TO OTHER PORTS

04:31:31.208 --> 04:31:32.809
IN THE BAY AREA -- THERE HAVE

YOU'RE ACTUALLY STILL BUILDING

IN THE BACK -- SO THAT'S WHY THE

04:31:49.793 --> 04:31:51.862
CDC WORD RETAINS JURISDICTION

04:31:51.928 --> 04:31:53.063

DANGEROUS PRECEDENT FOR

URBANIST HOUSING AN INFILL

04:59:22.611 --> 04:59:24.112
RATHER THAN SUBDIVISIONS.

04:59:24.179 --> 04:59:25.881
AND THIS WOULD PREVENT URBAN

04:59:25.947 --> 04:59:27.983
SPRAWL BUT IN CHICO PLANNING

04:59:28.050 --> 04:59:29.751

INFILL DEVELOPMENT.

04:59:35.757 --> 04:59:38.060
IT ALREADY HAS AN EXPENSIVE

04:59:38.126 --> 04:59:39.594
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE.

04:59:39.661 --> 04:59:41.096
AND WOULD OFFER POSSIBILITY OF

04:59:41.163 --> 04:59:42.664
EFFICIENT PUBLIC TRANSIT WALK

04:59:42.731 --> 04:59:46.601
ABILITY AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING --

04:59:46.668 --> 04:59:48.303
THIS KIND OF INFILL ALSO

04:59:48.370 --> 04:59:50.339
ADDRESSES I THINK ONE OF THE KEY

04:59:50.405 --> 04:59:56.545
FACTORS WHICH IS CLIMATE CHANGE --

04:59:56.611 --> 04:59:57.813
SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT ARE

04:59:57.879 --> 04:59:58.714
ARE.

04:59:58.780 --> 04:59:59.848
UP.

04:59:59.915 --> 05:00:00.449
RIGHT NOW CUMULATIVE LEE WOULD

05:00:00.515 --> 05:00:02.951
ACTUALLY GIVE TWENTY THREE

THOUSAND CAR TRIPS A DAY.

05:00:04.386 --> 05:00:06.188
AND CANNOT MITIGATE THEIR CARBON

05:00:06.254 --> 05:00:11.460
EMISSIONS -- SO -- FOR I THINK

05:00:11.526 --> 05:00:12.627
FOR TO WORSEN THE CLIMATE CHANGE

05:00:12.694 --> 05:00:14.262
IN AIR QUALITY THEY SHOULD NOT

05:00:14.329 --> 05:00:15.163
BE ALLOWED.

05:00:15.230 --> 05:00:16.465
AND THE IRONY WOULD BE TO

05:00:16.531 --> 05:00:18.734
APPROVE THAT BILL AB FOR THIRTY

05:00:18.800 --> 05:00:20.068

05:00:21.536 --> 05:00:22.738
OF DEVELOPMENTS WHICH WOULD

05:00:22.804 --> 05:00:24.539
ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE. TO MORE

05:29:23.009 --> 05:29:24.344
TECHNICAL I THINK THAT THEY'RE

05:29:24.411 --> 05:29:25.912
TRYING TO JUST SORT OF IT'S

05:29:25.979 --> 05:29:27.013
ALMOST LIKE I WAS IT IS SORT OF

05:29:27.080 --> 05:29:28.515
LIKE TECHNICAL CLEANUPS OF

05:29:28.582 --> 05:29:29.049
THINGS THAT JUST WEREN'T

05:29:29.116 --> 05:29:29.816
ANTICIPATED IN.

05:29:29.883 --> 05:29:31.084
SOME OF THE PASSED STREAMLINING

05:29:31.151 --> 05:29:32.686
BILLS THAT WERE DONE AS THEY'RE

05:29:32.752 --> 05:29:34.921

PEOPLE VOTED ON THIS

05:29:39.025 --> 05:29:39.926
ANTICIPATING THAT THESE PRODUCTS

05:29:39.993 --> 05:29:40.994
WILL GET BUILT.

05:29:41.061 --> 05:29:42.195
AND THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE

05:29:42.262 --> 05:29:42.796
SURE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE

05:29:42.863 --> 05:29:44.698
SORT OF ADMINISTRATIVE KIND OF

05:29:44.764 --> 05:29:46.066
HANG UPS IN THE PROCESS.

05:29:46.133 --> 05:29:47.767

05:29:47.834 --> 05:29:49.202
THE VOTERS OF LOS ANGELES RIGHT

05:29:49.269 --> 05:29:53.173
AND AND I GET THAT I GUESS I'M --

05:29:53.240 --> 05:29:53.974
AND I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THIS IDEA

05:29:54.040 --> 05:29:57.244
AND JUST WHEN WE GO BACK IN TIME

05:29:57.310 --> 05:29:58.345
TO THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE GO

05:29:58.411 --> 05:29:59.312

05:30:03.750 --> 05:30:05.018
APPROVED I THINK THAT'S A

05:30:05.085 --> 05:30:06.119
BACKWARDS WAY OF DOING THINGS

05:30:06.186 --> 05:30:08.021
WHICH IS WHAT SEEMS LIKE WHAT

05:30:08.088 --> 05:30:08.822
HAS HAPPENED HERE.

05:30:08.889 --> 05:30:09.856
THOUGH I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE

05:30:09.923 --> 05:30:11.758

HAVEN'T BEEN DISTRICTS SPECIFIC

05:30:21.668 --> 05:30:24.137
BUT I GUESS I DON'T WANT TO SEE

05:30:24.204 --> 05:30:27.007
A PATTERN OF GOING BACK IN TIME

05:30:27.073 --> 05:30:28.608
AND SORT OF TRYING TO FIX THINGS

05:30:28.675 --> 05:30:29.709

05:32:33.767 --> 05:32:35.602
THE SEQUESTERING LINING FROM THE

HOUSING PROJECT WHERE UNDER

05:32:51.785 --> 05:32:53.453
CURRENT LAW THE HOUSING PROJECT

HAS A SICK WAS STREAMLINING.

05:32:56.890 --> 05:32:57.757
BUT THE ORDINANCE THAT WOULD

05:32:57.824 --> 05:32:59.092
CREATE.

05:32:59.159 --> 05:33:01.194
THAT HOUSING PROJECT MAY NOT

05:33:01.261 --> 05:33:02.329
UNDER CURRENT LAW SO THEY WANTED

05:33:02.395 --> 05:33:04.464
TO CLARIFY THAT IT WOULD ALSO

05:33:04.531 --> 05:33:05.165
HAVE IT.

05:33:05.231 --> 05:33:07.067
AND THE FINANCING PART FOR THAT

05:33:07.133 --> 05:33:08.902
SAME EXACT PROJECT THE PROJECT

05:33:08.968 --> 05:33:10.837
WE KNOW THE BUILDING OF THE

05:33:10.904 --> 05:33:11.938
PROJECT HAS A SECRET

05:33:12.005 --> 05:33:14.107
STREAMLINING BUT THE CREATION OF

05:33:14.174 --> 05:33:15.675

THE WE KNOW THE BUILDING THE-CONSTRUCTION OF THE BUILDING

05:33:31.191 --> 05:33:32.625

05:33:32.692 --> 05:33:34.461
DOESN'T CHANGE THAT BUT IT DOES

05:33:34.527 --> 05:33:35.862

05:33:35.929 --> 05:33:36.696
NOW TO THE PASSING OF AN

05:33:36.763 --> 05:33:37.731

ARE PART OF THE STORE TO PLAN

05:43:54.747 --> 05:43:55.848
CALLED CARE.

05:43:55.915 --> 05:43:57.249
I JUST LIKE MAKE ONE CORRECTION

05:43:57.316 --> 05:43:58.584
THERE IS CURRENTLY AN APPROVED

05:43:58.651 --> 05:44:00.586
PLAN THAT CARE IS OPERATING

05:44:00.653 --> 05:44:01.821
UNDER AND THAT WAS APPROVED

05:44:01.887 --> 05:44:03.856
EARLIER THIS YEAR BY CAL RECYCLE

05:44:03.923 --> 05:44:05.291
I THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT

05:44:05.358 --> 05:44:06.158
THEY ARE TRYING TO MEET BY

05:44:06.225 --> 05:44:07.526
SEPTEMBER FIRST AND WE HAVE A

05:44:07.593 --> 05:44:10.596
RECYCLING RATE OF 24% OR CARE.

05:44:10.663 --> 05:44:11.831
DOES BY THE END OF THIS YEAR.

05:44:11.897 --> 05:44:13.532
I AGREE WITH THE WITH THE

05:44:13.599 --> 05:44:15.434
SOMEONE AND THAT WE NEED TO HAVE

05:44:15.501 --> 05:44:16.969
A CONTINUATION OR BRIDGE PLAN

05:44:17.036 --> 05:44:18.537
OUR CONCERN WHICH WAS REYES --

05:44:18.604 --> 05:44:20.539
BY JASON IS PUTTING THIRTY

05:44:20.606 --> 05:44:21.907
MILLION DOLLARS INTO AN ESCROW

05:44:21.974 --> 05:44:23.442
OR TRUST ACCOUNT AND OUR

05:44:23.509 --> 05:44:24.543
QUESTION IS WHERE DOES THAT

05:44:24.610 --> 05:44:25.911
MONEY COME FROM.

05:44:25.978 --> 05:44:27.413
THE MONEY THAT IS CURRENTLY IN

05:44:27.480 --> 05:44:29.148
THE CARE ACCOUNT IS GOING TO BE

05:44:29.215 --> 05:44:30.983
SPENT DOWN WHATEVER SURPLUS WE

05:44:31.050 --> 05:44:32.785
HAVE IT IS PART OF THE PLAN.

05:44:32.852 --> 05:44:33.586
THAT IS GOING TO USE FOR

05:44:33.652 --> 05:44:35.187
SUBSIDIES IT'S GONNA BE USED FOR

05:44:35.254 --> 05:44:35.755
GRANTS.

05:44:35.821 --> 05:44:37.223
IN IN DISCUSSIONS WITH CAL

05:44:37.289 --> 05:44:38.891
RECYCLE THEY WANTED TO HAVE A

05:44:38.958 --> 05:44:40.426
TWO MONTH RESERVE AND THAT'S

05:44:40.493 --> 05:44:41.994
WHAT WE'LL BE SPENDING DOWN THE

05:44:42.061 --> 05:44:43.596
SURPLUS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW

05:44:43.662 --> 05:44:44.730
SO WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT AN

05:44:44.797 --> 05:44:46.665
ADDITIONAL FEE AND CONSUMERS. TO

05:44:46.732 --> 05:44:47.800
CREATE ANOTHER THIRTY MILLION

05:44:47.867 --> 05:44:50.436
DOLLAR ACCOUNT IS WARRANTED --

05:44:50.503 --> 05:44:51.937
THIS ASSESSMENT AND CARBON HAS

05:44:52.004 --> 05:44:54.907
BEEN INCREASED GETTING BACK IN

05:44:54.974 --> 05:44:56.275
TWENTY ELEVEN FROM FIVE CENTS IT

05:44:56.342 --> 05:44:57.510
WAS JUST INCREASED -- NOW IT'S

05:44:57.576 --> 05:44:59.145
AT THIRTY FIVE CENTS THE LATEST

05:44:59.211 --> 05:45:00.279
INCREASE IN JANUARY FIRST OF

05:45:00.346 --> 05:45:01.547
THIS YEAR.

05:45:01.614 --> 05:45:02.581
THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL THAT

05:45:02.648 --> 05:45:04.316
WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IS

05:45:04.383 --> 05:45:05.918
ABOUT THE FINES HE USED TO BE

05:45:05.985 --> 05:45:08.120
THAT IF YOU WERE FIND UP TO TEN

05:45:08.187 --> 05:45:09.255
THOUSAND DOLLARS THERE HAD TO BE

05:45:09.321 --> 05:45:10.489
A STANDARD OF CONDUCT THAT HAD

05:45:10.556 --> 05:45:10.890
BE SHOWN.

05:45:10.956 --> 05:45:12.224
YOU HAD TO BE SHOWN THAT YOU'RE

05:45:12.291 --> 05:45:13.692
NEGLIGENT THERE'S INTENTIONAL

05:45:13.759 --> 05:45:15.194
MISCONDUCT OR KNOWING THIS

05:45:15.261 --> 05:45:16.762
CONDUCT WE BELIEVE THAT IS VERY

05:45:16.829 --> 05:45:17.897
IMPORTANT.

05:45:17.963 --> 05:45:19.031
BECAUSE WHEN YOU APPARATUS THE

05:45:19.098 --> 05:45:20.633
STEWARDSHIP PLAN YOU DON'T HAVE

05:45:20.699 --> 05:45:22.301
ANY DIRECT CONTROL YOU'RE

05:45:22.368 --> 05:45:24.336
WORKING WITH PROCESSORS TO

05:45:24.403 --> 05:45:25.571
WORKING WITH RECYCLERS YOU'RE

05:45:25.638 --> 05:45:27.006
WORKING WITH -- COLLECTORS AND

05:45:27.073 --> 05:45:28.240
MANUFACTURES.

05:45:28.307 --> 05:45:29.442
YOU'RE WORKING WITH THEM AND

05:45:29.508 --> 05:45:30.643
YOU'RE GETTING AGREEMENTS WITH

05:45:30.709 --> 05:45:31.710
THEM SAYING THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE

05:45:31.777 --> 05:45:33.846
PROMISING TO DO CERTAIN THINGS

05:45:33.913 --> 05:45:35.614
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS WHAT WE SEEN

05:45:35.681 --> 05:45:37.216
AS WE MAY HAVE AN EQUIPMENT

05:45:37.283 --> 05:45:38.417
FAILURE SOME OP PROCESS OR MAY

05:45:38.484 --> 05:45:39.685
HAVE AN EQUIPMENT FAILURE.

05:45:39.752 --> 05:45:41.320
WE HAD ONE COMPANY THIS YEAR

05:45:41.387 --> 05:45:42.321
THAT SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE

05:45:42.388 --> 05:45:44.023
ABLE TO TAKE THIRTY MILLION

05:45:44.090 --> 05:45:45.558
POUNDS OF CARPET.

05:45:45.624 --> 05:45:47.193
AND THEN THE COMPANY WAS SOLD

05:45:47.259 --> 05:45:48.427
AND SO THAT FACILITY IS NO

05:45:48.494 --> 05:45:49.995
LONGER RECYCLING CARPET THAT'S

05:45:50.062 --> 05:45:51.864
SOMETHING BEYOND OUR CONTROL SO

05:45:51.931 --> 05:45:53.265
WE BELIEVE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

05:45:53.332 --> 05:45:55.067
TO HAVE A STANDARD OF CONDUCT

05:45:55.134 --> 05:45:56.102
WHERE TO MINISTER TO LECTURE.

05:45:56.168 --> 05:45:58.537
JUDGE CAN LOOK TO SEE WHERE YOU

05:45:58.604 --> 05:45:59.538
NEGLIGENT IN YOUR DUTIES.

05:45:59.605 --> 05:46:00.606
IN YOUR DUTIES WERE YOU

05:46:00.673 --> 05:46:02.908
INTENTIONALLY WRONGFUL IN THE

05:46:02.975 --> 05:46:04.376
WAY YOU CONDUCTED YOUR BUSINESS

05:46:04.443 --> 05:46:05.444
SO WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IT'S

05:46:05.511 --> 05:46:07.680
VERY ARBITRARY -- WE THINK THAT

05:46:07.746 --> 05:46:10.049
THAT SHOULD BE REINSTATED AND IF

05:46:10.116 --> 05:46:16.489
GORDON MISTER SMELTER THAT YOU

05:46:16.555 --> 05:46:18.390
KNOW WE IN THE WEST OR CHIP PLAN

05:46:18.457 --> 05:46:20.025
THAT THEY HAVE -- THAT STANDARD

05:46:20.092 --> 05:46:20.659
THEY REMOVE THAT STANDARD BUT I

05:46:20.726 --> 05:46:21.160
WOULD JUST SAY THAT THE

05:46:21.227 --> 05:46:21.794
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY I THINK

05:46:21.861 --> 05:46:22.394
IT'S PROBABLY A HUNDRED TIMES

05:46:22.461 --> 05:46:23.062
BIGGER THAN THE CARPET INDUSTRY.

05:46:23.129 --> 05:46:23.696
AND SO THE NUMBERS THAT ARE IN

05:46:23.762 --> 05:46:24.363
THAT BILL I DON'T THINK COULD BE

05:46:24.430 --> 05:46:25.464
APPLICABLE TO HEAR FINALLY I'D

05:46:25.531 --> 05:46:27.333
LIKE TO CONCLUDE IS THAT OVER

05:46:27.399 --> 05:46:28.968
THE LAST -- DURING THE MOUNT OF

05:46:29.034 --> 05:46:30.436
THIS PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE GIVEN

05:46:30.503 --> 05:46:31.303
AWAY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN

05:46:31.370 --> 05:46:33.305
GRANTS FORTY FIVE MILLION

05:46:33.372 --> 05:46:35.007
DOLLARS IN SUBSIDIES AND WHILE

05:46:35.074 --> 05:46:36.375
THE CARPET RATE CONTINUES TO

05:46:36.442 --> 05:46:37.643
INCREASE WE HAVE SEEN THE

05:46:37.710 --> 05:46:38.878
DIFFICULTIES OF LIKE CAL

05:46:38.944 --> 05:46:40.312
RECYCLING TRYING TO MEET THE

05:46:40.379 --> 05:46:41.514
OVERALL RECYCLING RATE OF THE

05:46:41.580 --> 05:46:42.081
STATE WHICH IS.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM POWER

05:50:43.789 --> 05:50:44.723
CYCLE I THINK.

05:50:44.790 --> 05:50:46.458
THE IDEA IS WE WANT TO TALK TO

05:50:46.525 --> 05:50:47.960
THE OPPOSITION AND SAY WHAT WHAT

05:50:48.026 --> 05:50:49.995
MAKES SENSE PART WE HAVE TO

05:50:50.062 --> 05:50:51.430
REMEMBER AN EPR PROCESSES.

05:50:51.497 --> 05:50:53.399
IF THEY DISAPPROVE CARES PLAN

05:50:53.465 --> 05:50:54.199
AND THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS

05:50:54.266 --> 05:50:55.701
OF DOING ANOTHER PLAN THEY'RE

05:50:55.768 --> 05:50:56.935
GOING TO HAVE TIME LINES THAT

05:50:57.002 --> 05:50:58.003
ARE IN THE BILL THERE'S GOING TO

05:50:58.070 --> 05:50:59.471

REVIEW THE PLAN.

05:51:01.540 --> 05:51:03.275
SO IT COULD TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS

05:51:03.342 --> 05:51:05.144
TO A YEAR -- TO GET THE NEXT

05:51:05.210 --> 05:51:07.279
PLAN IN PLACE AND MOVING SO I

05:51:07.346 --> 05:51:09.148
THINK I CAN'T SPEAK FOR POWER

05:51:09.214 --> 05:51:10.716
CYCLE OF OBVIOUSLY NOT THAT --

05:51:10.783 --> 05:51:12.084
BUT I THINK THE IDEA WAS TO MAKE

05:51:12.151 --> 05:51:13.385
SURE THAT THERE WAS ENOUGH MONEY

05:51:13.452 --> 05:51:15.354

WHILE THE STATE WAS KIND OF

05:51:20.759 --> 05:51:21.293
FIGURING OUT ITS BUSINESS WITH

IS NOT IN PLACE THE MONEY WILL

05:51:43.749 --> 05:51:44.349
STILL KEEP FALLING INTO

05:51:44.416 --> 05:51:46.685
CALIFORNIA YOU CANNOT SELL

05:51:46.752 --> 05:51:48.287
CARPET IN CALIFORNIA.

05:51:48.353 --> 05:51:49.855
UNLESS YOU PAY AN ASSESSMENT SO

05:51:49.922 --> 05:51:51.056
THAT MONEY WILL CONTINUE TO FLOW

05:51:51.123 --> 05:51:53.058
IN THE CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT GOING

05:51:53.125 --> 05:51:54.726
TO STOP SO THERE WILL BE A FINE

05:51:54.793 --> 05:51:56.395

TO BE SITTING THERE IS GOING TO

05:52:34.800 --> 05:52:36.335
BE THIS WOULD BE THE SAME NO

05:52:36.401 --> 05:52:37.636
MATTER WHAT WHETHER IF IF CARE

05:52:37.703 --> 05:52:43.141
STILL EXISTS AFTER SEPTEMBER

05:52:43.208 --> 05:52:44.443
SECOND.

05:52:44.510 --> 05:52:46.245
NOT NOTHING CHANGES CHARACTERS

05:52:46.311 --> 05:52:46.979
GOES FORWARD THEY THEY DON'T

05:52:47.045 --> 05:52:48.080
NECESSARILY THEY WON'T

05:52:48.146 --> 05:52:48.614
NECESSARILY NEED A BIGGER

05:52:48.680 --> 05:52:50.148
RESERVE AND ANY NEW STORESHIP

05:52:50.215 --> 05:52:51.617
ORGANIZATION ISN'T GONNA

05:52:51.683 --> 05:52:52.150
NECESSARILY NEED A BIGGER

05:52:52.217 --> 05:52:52.718
RESERVE.

05:52:52.784 --> 05:52:53.919
AND AND JUST AS A MATTER OF

05:52:53.986 --> 05:52:55.687
EQUITY NO CHARACTER STARTED

05:52:55.754 --> 05:52:56.188
THEIR STASHED STARSHIP

05:52:56.255 --> 05:52:58.290
ORGANIZATION FROM SCRATCH NOBODY

05:52:58.357 --> 05:52:59.091
KNOWS.

05:52:59.157 --> 05:53:01.560
NOBODY -- NOBODY FOR PRE FUNDED

05:53:01.627 --> 05:53:02.995
THEM IN SAID HEY GET GET ROLLING

05:53:03.061 --> 05:53:04.196
I MEAN THEY STARTED FROM SCRATCH

05:53:04.263 --> 05:53:05.964
AND AND YOU KNOW AND IT'S HARD

05:53:06.031 --> 05:53:07.266
AND THEY'RE THEY'RE WORKING NOT

05:53:07.332 --> 05:53:11.436
THEY'RE WORKING ON YOU KNOW

05:53:11.503 --> 05:53:14.072
FINING AND MARKETS.

05:53:14.139 --> 05:53:15.807
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS

05:53:15.874 --> 05:53:18.210
MONEY YOUR RIGHT IT'S KATE CALM

05:53:18.277 --> 05:53:20.212
AND AND WE JUST WANTED TO PUT

05:53:20.279 --> 05:53:22.314
THAT INTO A TRUST ACCOUNT.

05:53:22.381 --> 05:53:23.048
JACKSON YOU HAVE.

05:53:23.115 --> 05:53:25.651
BUT I THINK THE PROBLEM --FROM

05:53:25.717 --> 05:53:26.151
THAT JUST A BUREAUCRATIC

05:53:26.218 --> 05:53:26.752
PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THERE'S

05:53:26.818 --> 05:53:27.419
NOTHING IN THE CURRENT LAW THAT

05:53:27.486 --> 05:53:28.053
SAYS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MONEY

05:53:28.120 --> 05:53:28.720
THAT INTO THE IN THE POSSESSION

05:53:28.787 --> 05:53:30.589
OF A STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION IF

05:53:30.656 --> 05:53:31.990
IT IS NO LONGER APPROVED BY

05:53:32.057 --> 05:53:32.824
CARMICHAEL.

05:53:32.891 --> 05:53:34.159
THERE'S NOTHING HAT SAYS WHAT

05:53:34.226 --> 05:53:36.328
HAPPENS TO THE CALIFORNIA FEW

05:53:36.395 --> 05:53:38.397
MONEY IF IT'S IN AN ACCOUNT IN

05:53:38.463 --> 05:53:41.133
GEORGIA IT JUST IT DOESN'T SPEAK

05:53:41.199 --> 05:53:46.538
TO IT.

05:53:46.605 --> 05:53:48.840
WHICH WHICH IS MY UNDERSTANDING

05:53:48.907 --> 05:53:49.841
THAT THAT'S PART OF THE INTENT

05:53:49.908 --> 05:53:51.243
OF THE BILL TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

05:53:51.310 --> 05:53:54.079
HAPPENS THERE -- AND WE'RE GOOD

05:53:54.146 --> 05:53:54.379
WITH THAT.

05:53:54.446 --> 05:53:55.647
YEAH.

05:53:55.714 --> 05:53:57.449
AND SO I MEAN IN THAT THERE

05:53:57.516 --> 05:53:58.517
SEEMS TO BE SOME COMMON GROUND

05:53:58.584 --> 05:54:00.285
AT LEAST ON ON THAT PART OF THE

05:54:00.352 --> 05:54:02.654
PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE.

05:54:02.721 --> 05:54:04.723
THE DOLLAR AMOUNT WHETHER IT'S A

05:54:04.790 --> 05:54:05.757
WHOLE YEAR'S WORTH OF PERCENT

05:54:05.824 --> 05:54:07.092
ESTIMATE THAT IS WHERE WE HAVE A

05:54:07.159 --> 05:54:08.527
DISCONNECT THEM.

05:54:08.594 --> 05:54:09.161
I WOULD HOPE YOU GUYS KIND OF

05:54:09.227 --> 05:54:10.729
COMING DOWN ON THAT WHERE YOU

05:54:10.796 --> 05:54:12.364
MIGHT NOT BE HAPPY BUT IT'S

05:54:12.431 --> 05:54:13.765
SOMETHING MAYBE A LITTLE LESS

05:54:13.832 --> 05:54:15.467
HERE THAN WHAT THEY'RE ASKING.

05:54:15.534 --> 05:54:16.301
FOR AND SO I KNOW RIGHT NOW YOU

05:54:16.368 --> 05:54:16.935
KIND OF TELL ME NO BUT I HOPE

05:54:17.002 --> 05:54:18.570
YOU MOVE CLOSER THAT DIRECTION

05:54:18.637 --> 05:54:21.740
AND AND THERE'S A SPACE BECAUSE

05:54:21.807 --> 05:54:23.041
BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH

05:54:23.108 --> 05:54:23.709
WORK AND THERE IS A BOOM IS THAT

05:54:23.775 --> 05:54:25.277
NEED TO HAPPEN HERE.

05:54:25.344 --> 05:54:27.012
ALONG THE WAY.

05:54:27.079 --> 05:54:28.246
AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION OF

05:54:28.313 --> 05:54:31.550
MY FINAL QUESTION IS ABOUT THE

05:54:31.617 --> 05:54:34.052
INTENTIONAL NEGLIGENT NEGLIGENCE

05:54:34.119 --> 05:54:35.520
AND WE ARE REMOVING THAT.

05:54:35.587 --> 05:54:37.255
IN THIS BILL.

05:54:37.322 --> 05:54:39.758
IN FOR FOR THE SPONSOR AND THE

05:54:39.825 --> 05:54:41.994
DOCTOR EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THAT'S

05:54:42.060 --> 05:54:43.528
IMPORTANT TO HELP US DO A BETTER

05:54:43.595 --> 05:54:45.464
JOB AND RECYCLING.

05:54:45.530 --> 05:54:46.999
MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE

05:54:47.065 --> 05:54:48.634
NEGLIGENCE JUST VERY DIFFICULT

05:54:48.700 --> 05:54:51.003
TO PROVE.

05:54:51.069 --> 05:54:52.371
SO THAT THAT'S WHY WERE CUT WILL

05:54:52.437 --> 05:54:55.007
HAVE TO CONSIDER AND PRETTY MUCH

05:54:55.073 --> 05:54:57.409
GIVE THE THE THE THE LAW JUDGES

05:54:57.476 --> 05:55:01.346
OF MORE DISCRETION ON HOW MUCH --

05:55:01.413 --> 05:55:03.615
THEY FIND A ONE OR TWO IN --

05:55:03.682 --> 05:55:08.654
IMPOSE ON ON A DAILY BASIS.

05:55:08.720 --> 05:55:10.322
SO IN THE EXISTING BILL THERE IS

05:55:10.389 --> 05:55:11.823
EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE COMPLAINING

05:55:11.890 --> 05:55:13.358
ABOUT NOW JUST AT A LOWER LEVEL

05:55:13.425 --> 05:55:15.594
THERE IS AN EXISTING ONE

05:55:15.661 --> 05:55:16.194
THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY THAT

05:55:16.261 --> 05:55:17.596
DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT THE MAVS

05:55:17.663 --> 05:55:19.264
BACK ON INTENTIONAL KNOWING OR

05:55:19.331 --> 05:55:20.565
NEGLIGENT SO THE STANDARD IS.

05:55:20.632 --> 05:55:22.467
IN CURRENT LAW RIGHT NOW AND IT

05:55:22.534 --> 05:55:24.469
IS IN CURRENT LAW AND SB TWO ONE

05:55:24.536 --> 05:55:26.171
TWO FOR PHARMACEUTICALS AT TEN

05:55:26.238 --> 05:55:27.372
THOUSAND DOLLARS I THINK.

05:55:27.439 --> 05:55:29.207
THE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE AND

05:55:29.274 --> 05:55:30.308
I'M NOT HERE TO KEEP ANYBODY OUT

05:55:30.375 --> 05:55:31.877
BUT WE'VE BEEN IN THIS ENDLESS

05:55:31.943 --> 05:55:32.744
ENFORCEMENT LOOP WITH THE

05:55:32.811 --> 05:55:37.115
INDUSTRY 201-320-1420. FIFTEEN

05:55:37.182 --> 05:55:38.550
TO TWENTY SIXTEEN PLAN WERE THE

05:55:38.617 --> 05:55:39.551
PLAN THAT'S IN THE PLACE RIGHT

05:55:39.618 --> 05:55:42.054
NOW IS ON A CONTINGENCY BASIS.

05:55:42.120 --> 05:55:43.922
IN SEPTEMBER COVER CYCLES GOING

05:55:43.989 --> 05:55:45.057
TO TRY TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT

05:55:45.123 --> 05:55:46.058
THEY'VE DONE THEIR JOB AS

05:55:46.124 --> 05:55:47.659
DESCRIBED IN THE PLAN IF THEY

05:55:47.726 --> 05:55:48.560
DON'T.

05:55:48.627 --> 05:55:49.528
WE'RE GONNA BE IN THIS POSITION

05:55:49.594 --> 05:55:50.562
WHERE WE'RE GONNA BE EITHER

05:55:50.629 --> 05:55:53.865
DISAPPROVING A PLANNER REPEALING

05:55:53.932 --> 05:55:56.601
A PLAN AND YOUR EARLIER POINT.

05:55:56.668 --> 05:55:57.502
I THINK I OBVIOUSLY CAN'T SPEAK

05:55:57.569 --> 05:55:58.103
ON BEHALF OF THE DEPARTMENT I

05:55:58.170 --> 05:55:59.304
THINK THERE'S A DESIRE FOR MORE

05:55:59.371 --> 05:56:00.839
TEETH IN THE ENFORCEMENT.

05:56:00.906 --> 05:56:02.674
MECHANISM THAT'S IN CURRENT LAW.

05:56:02.741 --> 05:56:04.076
BECAUSE I THINK WE CAN ALL ADMIT

05:56:04.142 --> 05:56:05.043
THAT THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM

05:56:05.110 --> 05:56:05.944
THAT'S IN CURRENT LAW RIGHT NOW

05:56:06.011 --> 05:56:08.046
IS NOT WORKING BECAUSE WE'VE

05:56:08.113 --> 05:56:08.513
BEEN IN THIS AND LET'S

05:56:08.580 --> 05:56:09.915
ENFORCEMENT LIVE. FOR YEARS AND

05:56:09.981 --> 05:56:12.417
YEARS AND YEARS.

05:56:12.484 --> 05:56:13.719
SO IF I'M INTERPRETING CORRECTLY

05:56:13.785 --> 05:56:15.520
YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT BY

05:56:15.587 --> 05:56:16.755
REMOVING THIS OR CHANGING THIS

05:56:16.822 --> 05:56:18.423
LANGUAGE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

05:56:18.490 --> 05:56:20.225
BETTER ENFORCEMENT.

05:56:20.292 --> 05:56:21.326
BUT IT'S STILL GOING TO BE THE

05:56:21.393 --> 05:56:22.961
LEGAL PROCESS NONETHELESS AND IS

05:56:23.028 --> 05:56:26.898
STILL RIGHT.

05:56:26.965 --> 05:56:28.066
YES CORRECT THE MET AND THAT'S

05:56:28.133 --> 05:56:29.167
MY MY INTERPRETATION OF THE

05:56:29.234 --> 05:56:31.770
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT WE

05:56:31.837 --> 05:56:33.772
RECEIVE YES.

05:56:33.839 --> 05:56:34.706
HI I JUST SAID TO ME WHAT YOU'RE

05:56:34.773 --> 05:56:36.308
DOING HERE THAT IF YOU MISS ONE

05:56:36.374 --> 05:56:38.110
DEADLINE YOU COULD BE FINED TEN

05:56:38.176 --> 05:56:39.377
THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY.

05:56:39.444 --> 05:56:41.179
YOU CAN MISS AN ANNUAL REPORT BE

05:56:41.246 --> 05:56:42.681
FINED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY

05:56:42.748 --> 05:56:44.716
THE WAY IT'S SET UP RIGHT NOW

05:56:44.783 --> 05:56:46.818
AND AS CHASIN INDICATED.

05:56:46.885 --> 05:56:48.587
YES -- IS NOT REALLY YEARS WE

05:56:48.653 --> 05:56:49.855
HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO

05:56:49.921 --> 05:56:51.022
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE WITH A

05:56:51.089 --> 05:56:52.257
FINE HE'S LOOK AT ALL THE

05:56:52.324 --> 05:56:54.626
INFORMATION AND HE DETERMINED

05:56:54.693 --> 05:56:55.927
THAT WE WERE NOT NEGLIGENT.

05:56:55.994 --> 05:56:57.395
BECAUSE HE REALIZED THAT WE HAVE

05:56:57.462 --> 05:56:58.797
THEIR CONTRACT WITH THIRD PARTY

05:56:58.864 --> 05:57:00.465
TO KNOW TO DO CERTAIN THINGS.

05:57:00.532 --> 05:57:02.534
SO IN HIS RULINGS HE HAS FOUND

05:57:02.601 --> 05:57:04.369
THAT WE WERE NOT NEGLIGENT OR

05:57:04.436 --> 05:57:05.370
THERE IS NO INTENTION MISCONDUCT

05:57:05.437 --> 05:57:06.304
WHICH WE BELIEVE IS VERY

05:57:06.371 --> 05:57:07.172
IMPORTANT.

05:57:07.239 --> 05:57:08.507
IF YOU'RE GONNA YOU KNOW WE HAVE

05:57:08.573 --> 05:57:09.608
LOTS OF PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA

05:57:09.674 --> 05:57:11.209
CAL RECYCLE ARE WE ALL GOING TO

05:57:11.276 --> 05:57:11.810
HOLD EACH OTHER TO THAT SAME

05:57:11.877 --> 05:57:12.644
STANDARD.

05:57:12.711 --> 05:57:16.848
BECAUSE VERY HARD TO DO THAT

05:57:16.915 --> 05:57:17.449
WHEN YOU'RE RELYING UPON THIRD

05:57:17.516 --> 05:57:21.086
PARTIES -- I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR

05:57:21.153 --> 05:57:26.324
FOR THE BILL TODAY I I DO YOU.

05:57:26.391 --> 05:57:28.293
HAVEN'T HAD STATIONS ABOUT.

05:57:28.360 --> 05:57:32.664
REMOVE INTENTIONAL NEGLIGENCE.

05:57:32.731 --> 05:57:33.765
THERE'S TIME FOR SALE WE SHE

05:57:33.832 --> 05:57:34.432
LITTLE BETTER WE SHOULD BE DOING

05:57:34.499 --> 05:57:36.168
IT BETTER BUT WE STILL SCREW UP

05:57:36.234 --> 05:57:37.068
I JUST GOT A LETTER ABOUT

05:57:37.135 --> 05:57:38.003
SOMETHING I TURNED IN TWO DAYS

05:57:38.069 --> 05:57:39.504
LATE AND AM I HAVE TO DEAL WITH

05:57:39.571 --> 05:57:41.306
THAT AND MY FIRST GUT REACTION

05:57:41.373 --> 05:57:42.107
US LIKE I SHOULD KNOW BETTER.

05:57:42.174 --> 05:57:43.074
BUT THEN THEY WERE LIKE YOU

05:57:43.141 --> 05:57:45.110
ACTUALLY WERE WAITING FOR LEGAL --

05:57:45.177 --> 05:57:46.611
OPINION AND THAT'S WHY I TOOK HE

05:57:46.678 --> 05:57:48.380
TOOK TWO DAYS AND SO CYCLE OKAY

05:57:48.446 --> 05:57:49.548
WELL THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF AND

05:57:49.614 --> 05:57:52.851
STILL GETTING TING.

05:57:52.918 --> 05:57:54.419
RIGHT AN SO.

05:57:54.486 --> 05:57:55.320
IT JUST REMINDS YOU OF WHY

05:57:55.387 --> 05:57:56.021
INTENTIONAL NEGLIGENCE AND

05:57:56.087 --> 05:57:57.489
SOMETHING THAT I DO THINK IT'S

05:57:57.556 --> 05:57:58.723
SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT HELLO

05:57:58.790 --> 05:57:59.357
FOR THE BILL TODAY I DON'T KNOW

05:57:59.424 --> 05:57:59.724
IF.

05:57:59.791 --> 05:58:01.960
AS THIS BILL MOVES WITH THAT

05:58:02.027 --> 05:58:02.594
PIECE I'M GOING TO BE OKAY WITH

05:58:02.661 --> 05:58:03.195
THAT DOWN THE ROAD [inaudible]

05:58:03.261 --> 05:58:05.697
THANK YOU.

05:58:05.764 --> 05:58:07.265
AND JUST TO BE CLEAR THE FINE IS

05:58:07.332 --> 05:58:08.867
UP TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A DAY

05:58:08.934 --> 05:58:10.135
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT HAS TO

05:58:10.202 --> 05:58:11.670
BE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS.

05:58:11.736 --> 05:58:13.939
SO IT DOES GIVE -- OF

05:58:14.005 --> 05:58:15.640
FLEXIBILITY TO LOOK AT EACH

05:58:15.707 --> 05:58:18.276
PARTICULAR INSTANCE AND TO SAY.

05:58:18.343 --> 05:58:19.177
IS IT SOMETHING THAT'S AGREE

05:58:19.244 --> 05:58:20.712
JUST ARE NOT IS IT SOMETHING

05:58:20.779 --> 05:58:21.746
THAT REALLY WARRANTS THAT KIND

05:58:21.813 --> 05:58:24.549
OF FINE OR WAS THERE SOMETHING

05:58:24.616 --> 05:58:25.417
THAT HAPPENED THAT WAS OUT OF

05:58:25.483 --> 05:58:26.918
THEIR CONTROL SO THERE CAN

05:58:26.985 --> 05:58:29.087
CERTAINLY BE A LOT OF DISCRETION --
