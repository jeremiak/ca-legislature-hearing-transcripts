RATE TO A GIVEN PLANT SAVES

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:17.468

00:41:04.195 --> 00:41:05.729
THIS TECHNOLOGY COMING IN MORE

00:41:05.796 --> 00:41:10.100
MORE. WITH A WORKER. SHORTAGE IS

00:41:10.167 --> 00:41:11.769

00:41:18.442 --> 00:41:20.110
MAKE IT SO TOUGH ON AG WE'RE

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:21.846
DRIVES UP COSTS FOR THE

00:41:21.912 --> 00:41:23.781
CONSUMER. IT MAKES IT SO MUCH

00:41:23.848 --> 00:41:24.915
MORE EXPENSIVE I MEAN FOR

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:26.016

THAT'S DIFFICULT FOR SOMEONE AG

00:41:34.725 --> 00:41:36.393

THIRTY MILLION DOLLAR- BIOMASS

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:11.715
PLANT IS OUT THE RICE HOLDING

00:44:11.782 --> 00:44:14.118
COMPANY IN WILLIAMS. AND THEY

QUITE FRANK WITH ME THIS IS

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.935
THAT'S THE PROBLEM. IS TRYING TO

00:44:32.002 --> 00:44:33.971
FIND THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE

00:44:34.038 --> 00:44:35.539
BECAUSE THESE ARE BIG COMPUTERS

00:44:35.606 --> 00:44:37.775
AND TECHNOLOGY. TO RUN THE

00:44:37.841 --> 00:44:40.911
PLANT. AND HE OBVIOUSLY

00:44:40.978 --> 00:44:42.813
SUGGESTED. LOG COMMITTEE

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:44.314
COLLEGES NEED TO FUNNEL MORE

HIGH SCHOOLS NEED TO FUNNEL MORE

00:44:49.019 --> 00:44:50.721
KIDS IN BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY

BUSINESS- AND THE OTHER ONE IS

00:44:57.428 --> 00:44:59.296
WE TALKED ABOUT- THE SUPPLY

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:01.065
CHAIN. AND THE ISSUE THAT'S

00:45:01.131 --> 00:45:03.000
HAPPENING AT THE PORTS AND NOT

00:45:03.067 --> 00:45:04.034
BEING ABLE TO GET OUR EXPORTS

00:45:04.101 --> 00:45:06.370
OUT. AND IF HE SAID IF THERE WAS

00:45:06.437 --> 00:45:08.906
DATA COLLECTION AND TECHNICAL

00:45:08.972 --> 00:45:11.008
EXPERTISE TO BE ABLE TO TRACK

00:45:11.075 --> 00:45:12.876
YOUR PRODUCT FROM THE MINUTE IT

00:45:12.943 --> 00:45:14.078
LEAVES OUR WAREHOUSE TO THE

00:45:14.144 --> 00:45:16.013
MINUTE IT ARRIVES. AT ITS

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.714
DESTINATION IT WOULD BE HELPFUL

00:45:17.781 --> 00:45:18.615
TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE A

00:45:18.682 --> 00:45:20.117

PART OF THE ANSWER LIES IN ONE

00:48:51.862 --> 00:48:53.430
EMBRACING NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT

OUR WORKFORCE THE PEOPLE WHO

00:49:01.204 --> 00:49:03.607
WILL INVENT OPERATE IN SEWER

00:49:03.674 --> 00:49:05.842
INDUSTRY IN A BETTER FUTURE. THE

00:49:05.909 --> 00:49:07.377
EMERGING AD TECH INDUSTRY HAS

00:49:07.444 --> 00:49:09.446
EXPERIENCED EXPLOSIVE GROWTH IN

00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:10.781
THE LAST TEN YEARS AS WAS

00:49:10.847 --> 00:49:12.149
MENTIONED IN THE INVESTMENT IS

00:49:12.215 --> 00:49:13.917
INCREASING FOR SOLUTIONS FOR

SUSTAINABLE FARMING HEALTHY FOOD

00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:17.821
AND SUPPLY CHAIN RESILIENCE

00:49:17.888 --> 00:49:19.356
AMONG OTHER THINGS. THIS HAS

00:49:19.423 --> 00:49:21.458
BEEN DRIVEN BY BOTH BY LARGER

00:49:21.525 --> 00:49:23.894
FARMING FOOD INCUMBENTS BUT ALSO

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.762
BY SILICON VALLEY INVESTORS AND

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:28.065
TECHNOLOGISTS. AND MUCH OF MY

00:49:28.131 --> 00:49:30.133
AND OTHERS IN THIS ROOM TO WORK

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.635
IS TO BRIDGE THE VERY LARGE

00:49:31.702 --> 00:49:33.570
BUSINESS AND CULTURAL GAPS.

00:49:33.637 --> 00:49:35.539
BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND

00:49:35.605 --> 00:49:37.541
TECHNOLOGY. BUT THE WRITINGS ON

00:49:37.607 --> 00:49:40.243
THE WALL. INNOVATIONS SUCH AS

00:49:40.310 --> 00:49:41.912
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

00:49:41.978 --> 00:49:43.714
BIOLOGICAL ADVANCES OF SUCH AS

00:49:43.780 --> 00:49:46.450
CRISPR. IN CLOUD COMPUTING ARE

00:49:46.516 --> 00:49:48.118
DEMONSTRATING THAT AGTECH IS

00:49:48.185 --> 00:49:51.021
HERE TO STAY. AND WILL CONTINUE

00:49:51.088 --> 00:49:53.890
TO TRANSFORM THE WAY WE GROW UP

00:49:53.957 --> 00:49:55.525
AND AS WELL AS CONSUME FOOD.

00:49:55.592 --> 00:49:56.727
THAT MEANS CALIFORNIA'S

00:49:56.793 --> 00:49:58.895
AGRICULTURAL WORKFORCE MUSH MUST

00:49:58.962 --> 00:50:01.064
LOOK MUCH DIFFERENT IN THE

00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:02.699
COMING YEARS AND WE MUST PREPARE

00:50:02.766 --> 00:50:03.734
FOR THAT STARTING WITH TODAY'S

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.969
PROFESSIONALS. AS WELL AS OUR

00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:06.937
COLLEGE LEVEL INVENTORS AND

OPERATORS AND OUR YOUNG SCHOOL

00:50:08.605 --> 00:50:10.674
CHILDREN. IT'S A CHALLENGE TO

00:50:10.741 --> 00:50:11.975
ATTRACT YOUNG PEOPLE INTO THE AG

00:50:12.042 --> 00:50:14.144
INDUSTRY AS THEY IMAGINE OR HEAR

00:50:14.211 --> 00:50:15.479
STORIES FROM PARENTS ABOUT

00:50:15.545 --> 00:50:17.481
BACKBREAKING WORK AND LOW PAY.

00:50:17.547 --> 00:50:19.282
THE REALITY IS THERE ARE MANY

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:20.917
HIGH PAYING REWARDING CAREERS IN

00:50:20.984 --> 00:50:23.253
AG INDUSTRY. AND AS THE FOOD AN

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:26.456
ACTIVE SECTORS- BECOME MORE

00:50:26.523 --> 00:50:27.023
DIGITISED THERE WILL BE MANY

00:50:27.090 --> 00:50:30.127
MORE. THE NEED WE SEE IS THAT

00:50:30.193 --> 00:50:32.195
THAT WORKERS AT ALL LEVELS FROM

00:50:32.262 --> 00:50:33.797

NEED TO HAVE SKILLS THAT SPAN

00:50:43.273 --> 00:50:46.009
AGRICULTURE BIOLOGY COMPUTER

00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:47.778
SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING. WE NEED

00:50:47.844 --> 00:50:49.346
TO HAVE FARM EXPERTISE AND KNOW

00:50:49.413 --> 00:50:51.314
HOW TO USE ABSENT MACHINES AND

00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:53.750
EVENTUALLY ROBOTS. THESE

00:50:53.817 --> 00:50:55.252
DISCIPLINES ARE TRADITIONALLY

00:50:55.318 --> 00:50:57.654
ODD BEDFELLOWS AND I'VE SEEN

00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:59.489

MENTIONED I CREATED A NEW

00:52:04.654 --> 00:52:05.956
EXAMPLE AFTER THE MENTION ABOUT

00:52:06.022 --> 00:52:09.159
SMALL FARMS- AND A SMALL FARMS

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:11.161
IS OBVIOUSLY A VERY. IMPORTANT

00:52:11.228 --> 00:52:13.630
COMPONENT IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO

00:52:13.697 --> 00:52:14.631
THERE'S A VARIETY OF NEW

00:52:14.698 --> 00:52:15.866
PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON

00:52:15.932 --> 00:52:17.267
LIKE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW

00:52:17.334 --> 00:52:20.470
FOOD HUB- IN- IN YOLO COUNTY AND

00:52:20.537 --> 00:52:21.671
FOOD HUBS ARE ARE POPPING UP

00:52:21.738 --> 00:52:23.707
AROUND THE STATE AS WELL. AS

00:52:23.773 --> 00:52:26.576
WELL AS A SMALL- FARM TECHNOLOGY

LENDING LIBRARY IN THE FRESNO

00:52:28.578 --> 00:52:30.347
REGION- LET OUT OF OUR CURRENT

00:52:30.413 --> 00:52:34.017
FACILITY- NEAR PARLAY- IT'S

00:52:34.084 --> 00:52:35.085
PROGRAMS LIKE THAT THAT WE'RE

00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:36.853
WE'RE TRYING TO HELP US SMALL

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:37.721
FARMERS THERE'S A WILL THERE'S-

00:52:37.787 --> 00:52:39.089
A VARIETY OF OTHER EXAMPLES I

00:52:39.155 --> 00:52:41.591
COULD GIVE. THESE ARE IMPORTANT

00:52:41.658 --> 00:52:42.859
BUT ONLY A DROP IN THE BUCKET OF

00:52:42.926 --> 00:52:44.361
WHAT'S NEEDED TO TRANSFORM OUR

00:52:44.427 --> 00:52:45.795
FOOD NICK WORKFORCE.

00:52:45.862 --> 00:52:48.098
OPPORTUNITIES THERE NOT ONLY TO

00:52:48.164 --> 00:52:50.000
MAKE- TODAY'S AGRICULTURE

00:52:50.066 --> 00:52:51.501
ECONOMY MORE SUSTAINABLE AND

00:52:51.568 --> 00:52:53.570
PROFITABLE. BUT I BELIEVE THE

00:52:53.637 --> 00:52:55.105
NEXT GENERATION OF AGTECH CAN

00:52:55.171 --> 00:52:56.206
CAN COMPLETELY TRANSFORM

00:52:56.273 --> 00:52:58.241
CALIFORNIA'S RURAL ECONOMIES

00:52:58.308 --> 00:53:00.744
BIOBASED PRODUCTS AND MATERIALS

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:03.547
THAT USED- WASTE AS INGREDIENTS

00:53:03.613 --> 00:53:05.148
. NEW CROPS AND FARMING METHODS

00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:06.650
LIKE STRAWBERRIES GROWN VERTICAL

00:53:06.716 --> 00:53:08.952
FARMS NEW FOODS LIKE ALTERNATIVE

00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:10.220
PROTEINS ARE ALL YOU KNOW

00:53:10.287 --> 00:53:12.055
DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE OF A BIG

00:53:12.122 --> 00:53:13.356
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FUTURE OF

00:53:13.423 --> 00:53:14.991
CALIFORNIA'S ROLE ECONOMIES IN

00:53:15.058 --> 00:53:16.226
PARTICULAR IF WE CAN TAKE

00:53:16.293 --> 00:53:19.029
LEADERSHIP OF THE OPPORTUNITIES

00:53:19.095 --> 00:53:20.130
AND INVEST IN THE WORKFORCE.

00:53:20.196 --> 00:53:21.164
I'LL LEAVE YOU WITH COUPLE

00:53:21.231 --> 00:53:22.966
THOUGHTS ABOUT WHAT STILL NEEDED

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:23.433
FOR CONSIDERATION THIS

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:25.569
COMMITTEE'S WORK- TO HELP US GET

00:53:25.635 --> 00:53:27.537
READY TO GO. ONE NEED TO

00:53:27.604 --> 00:53:29.072
CONTINUE TO INVEST IN EDUCATION

00:53:29.139 --> 00:53:31.207
ALL LEVELS GRADE SCHOOL THROUGH

00:53:31.274 --> 00:53:33.109
UNIVERSITY BY SUPPORTING THOSE

00:53:33.176 --> 00:53:35.211
PROGRAMS. THAT ARE WORKING AND

00:53:35.278 --> 00:53:37.080
ARE BRINGING NEW YOUNG PEOPLE TO

00:53:37.147 --> 00:53:39.182
THE MANY PATHWAYS INTO THE FOOD

00:53:39.249 --> 00:53:41.151
BANK SECTOR- MANY PROGRAMS TO

00:53:41.217 --> 00:53:42.218
GET STARTED TO GRANT FUNDING

00:53:42.285 --> 00:53:43.987
WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME

00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:45.789
SUSTAINING AND SCALING. BUT

00:53:45.855 --> 00:53:47.591
SECOND TRAIN NEXT GENERATION OF

00:53:47.657 --> 00:53:49.526
YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS AND FUSING

00:53:49.593 --> 00:53:51.161
THEM WITH THE SKILL SETS TO

00:53:51.227 --> 00:53:52.195
SOLVE CALIFORNIA'S BIGGEST

00:53:52.262 --> 00:53:53.630
CLIMATE AND FOOD SYSTEM.

00:53:53.697 --> 00:53:54.998
RESILIENCE TO CHALLENGE IT IS

00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:57.567
VERY IMPORTANT. I NEED TO FOCUS

00:53:57.634 --> 00:53:58.635
ON A RURAL COMMUNITIES SO THESE

00:53:58.702 --> 00:54:00.203
YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS CAN BUILD

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:01.137
THESE GLOBALLY LEADING COMPANIES

00:54:01.204 --> 00:54:03.373
OF THE FUTURE THE GOOGLE FOR AG

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.609
I'M FROM THE RURAL COMMUNITIES

AND REVITALIZE OF THE COLONIES.

00:54:07.277 --> 00:54:09.012
LAST CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE IS

00:54:09.079 --> 00:54:10.413
WORTH FIGHTING FOR AND THE

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.215
FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE AMONG

00:54:12.282 --> 00:54:14.050
THE BEST IN THE WORLD. OUR

ABILITY TO FEED OUR STATE AND

00:54:15.251 --> 00:54:17.354
OUR NATION. NATIONAL SECURITY

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:18.855
THROUGH FOOD SECURITY IS A

00:54:18.922 --> 00:54:20.757
WORTHY AND IMPORTANT GOAL. IN

00:54:20.824 --> 00:54:21.925
CALIFORNIA PRODUCES THE FOOD

00:54:21.992 --> 00:54:22.993
THAT WE SHOULD BE EATING MORE

00:54:23.059 --> 00:54:26.029
FRUITS VEGETABLES AND NUTS. WE

00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:27.797
NEED TO WORK FORCE TODAY. A

00:54:27.864 --> 00:54:29.132
WORKFORCE THAT DRIVE THE NEXT

00:54:29.199 --> 00:54:30.100
GENERATION OF FARMING FOOD

00:54:30.166 --> 00:54:31.334
PRODUCTION AND THE FUTURE

00:54:31.401 --> 00:54:33.870
BIOECONOMY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:54:33.937 --> 00:54:35.271
TIME I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR

00:54:35.338 --> 00:54:37.007
QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION. AND

00:54:37.073 --> 00:54:40.210
HOSTING A FARM TOURS IN ANY OF

00:54:40.276 --> 00:54:41.978
YOUR DISTRICTS THANKS. ANY

00:54:42.045 --> 00:54:45.782
QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. I'M JUST

00:54:45.849 --> 00:54:46.916
A QUICK QUESTION COULD YOU

00:54:46.983 --> 00:54:49.185
ELABORATE MORE ON THE SMALL FARM

00:54:49.252 --> 00:54:51.955
LENDING HOW THAT'S HOW THEY YEAH

00:54:52.022 --> 00:54:54.190
SO THAT PROBLEM IS- IS NOT

00:54:54.257 --> 00:54:55.492
GOTTEN OFF THE GROUND JUST YET

00:54:55.558 --> 00:54:57.293
WE'VE GOT WE HAVE A UC SMALL

00:54:57.360 --> 00:55:00.096
FARMS NETWORK WHICH HAS- SMALL

00:55:00.163 --> 00:55:01.998
FARMS ADVISORS THAT ARE LOCATED

00:55:02.065 --> 00:55:02.832
ACROSS THE STATE ONE IN

00:55:02.899 --> 00:55:05.068
PARTICULAR IN FRESNO COUNTY-

00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:06.302
RUTH DAHLQUIST WILLARD WHO WORKS

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:08.638
WITH- SMALL FARMERS PARTICULARLY

00:55:08.705 --> 00:55:11.508
FARMERS OF COLOR- IN CREATING

00:55:11.574 --> 00:55:13.610
NEW PRODUCTS- SHE HAS REALLY

00:55:13.677 --> 00:55:16.279
SEEN THE NEED- FOR TRAINING

00:55:16.346 --> 00:55:18.214
SMALL FARMS ON THE USE OF WHAT

00:55:18.281 --> 00:55:19.015
YOU WOULD CALL APPROPRIATE

00:55:19.082 --> 00:55:20.383
TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGY COULD

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:22.519
SCALE DOWN AND COST EFFECTIVE

00:55:22.585 --> 00:55:24.387
ENOUGH FOR SMALL FARMS TO USE.

00:55:24.454 --> 00:55:25.922
BUT THEY'RE STILL A BARRIER IN

00:55:25.989 --> 00:55:28.091
KNOWING WAT'S AVAILABLE HOW TO

00:55:28.158 --> 00:55:29.793
USE IT AND THEN ACQUIRING IT AND

00:55:29.859 --> 00:55:31.361
SO THE IDEA IS THAT WE'RE

00:55:31.428 --> 00:55:32.629
WORKING ON NOW THAT WE'RE GOING

00:55:32.696 --> 00:55:34.164
TO LIKELY FUNDS FOR SOME GRANT

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:36.166
ENTERPRISE IS TO GET A

00:55:36.232 --> 00:55:38.068
COLLECTION OF THIS TECHNOLOGY

00:55:38.134 --> 00:55:40.503
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY THEN WENT

00:55:40.570 --> 00:55:42.472
OUT TO FARMERS IN THE REGION- WE

00:55:42.539 --> 00:55:47.343
CAN TRAIN ON HOW TO USE IT.

00:55:47.410 --> 00:55:50.580
DON'T HAVE TODAY. THAT SOUNDS

00:55:50.647 --> 00:55:52.849
REALLY GREAT THANK YOU. THE

00:55:52.916 --> 00:55:56.019
OTHERS ON SCENE AND- I DO HAVE A

00:55:56.086 --> 00:55:58.722
QUESTION FOR YOU MISTER C. LIKE

00:55:58.788 --> 00:56:01.057
HOW EARLY SHOULD WE BEGIN

00:56:01.124 --> 00:56:03.526
TEACHING I MEAN I KNOW I'M SURE

00:56:03.593 --> 00:56:05.061
UNIVERSITIES ARE WORKING ON THIS

00:56:05.128 --> 00:56:07.964
BUT I'M TALKING AND IN THE- HOT

00:56:08.031 --> 00:56:10.967
WHAT'S THAT WOULD WELL EARLY AGE

00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:12.702
YOU KNOW- OUR BUYER DIVISION

00:56:12.769 --> 00:56:14.070
RUNS THE- ONES. H. FOR THE STATE

00:56:14.137 --> 00:56:15.205
OF CALIFORNIA SO I THINK WE

00:56:15.271 --> 00:56:17.006
BELIEVE THAT SHOULD BEGIN VERY

00:56:17.073 --> 00:56:18.908
EARLY IN GRADE SCHOOL. AND I

00:56:18.975 --> 00:56:20.176
THINK YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR THINK

00:56:20.243 --> 00:56:22.378
SOME GREAT EXAMPLES OF

00:56:22.445 --> 00:56:23.179
NONTRADITIONAL EDUCATION THAT

00:56:23.246 --> 00:56:25.181
GETS KIDS INTO GET DICK

00:56:25.248 --> 00:56:28.618
LEARNING- SPACES- REALLY AT THE

00:56:28.685 --> 00:56:30.153
GRADE SCHOOL LEVEL I DON'T I

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:31.955
THINK IT'S NOT EVER TOO EARLY TO

00:56:32.021 --> 00:56:33.289
START AND I THINK IF WE REALLY

00:56:33.356 --> 00:56:35.291
WANT TO GET KIDS INTERESTED IN

00:56:35.358 --> 00:56:37.093
TRAJECTORY TRULY IN. CAREERS OF

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.995
THE FUTURE HE REALLY TO CAPTURE

00:56:39.062 --> 00:56:40.063
THEIR IMAGINATION AND GRADE

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.398
SCHOOL SO I THINK TO ME GRADE

00:56:42.465 --> 00:56:44.100
SCHOOL IS THE PLACE TO BEGIN.

00:56:44.167 --> 00:56:46.102
AND THEN YOU KNOW ASSEMBLY WORK-

00:56:46.169 --> 00:56:48.404
THROUGH THROUGH- UNDERGRADUATE

00:56:48.471 --> 00:56:50.573
GRADUATE EDUCATION I UNDER

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:54.244
PERCENT AGREE WITH YOU I MEAN WE

00:56:54.310 --> 00:56:56.713
- IN OUR- WE- OUR FARM BUREAU.

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:59.382
DOES ORGANIZE- EVENTS WITH

00:56:59.449 --> 00:57:02.385
SCHOOLS THAT EARLY AGE IN THE-

00:57:02.452 --> 00:57:04.120
IT'S FUN TO WATCH THE KIDS

00:57:04.187 --> 00:57:06.189
REALIZE THAT YOU KNOW EVERYTHING

00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:07.724
THEY'RE TOUCHING EVERYTHING THAT

00:57:07.791 --> 00:57:10.794
THEY'RE EATING IS LITERALLY. YOU

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.629
KNOW COMING FROM A FARM AND

00:57:12.695 --> 00:57:14.497
THEY'VE THEY'RE FASCINATED RIGHT

00:57:14.564 --> 00:57:16.232
BUT THE FAST THE BECAUSE THEY

00:57:16.299 --> 00:57:18.301
DON'T HERE IN SCHOOLS RIGHT AND

00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:19.836
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

00:57:19.903 --> 00:57:21.871
NEED TO DO MORE OF. IT DOESN'T

00:57:21.938 --> 00:57:22.872
HAVE TO BE PARTICULAR HIGH TECH

00:57:22.939 --> 00:57:24.908
EITHER IT REALLY JUST BE EX YOU

00:57:24.974 --> 00:57:28.645
KNOW THEM EXPERIENCING- FARM AND

00:57:28.711 --> 00:57:29.979
WHERE THEIR FOOD COMES FROM IN A

00:57:30.046 --> 00:57:31.648
VERY VERY SIMPLE WAY TO CAPTURE

00:57:31.714 --> 00:57:33.116
THAT IMAGE AND IMAGINATION FROM

TECHNOLOGY BEING. THE BRIDGE. TO

00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:13.049
THE FUTURE M. AND WE CERTAINLY

00:59:13.116 --> 00:59:14.517
AGREE WITH THAT AND WE AND WE

ATTENTION TO SOME OF THE THINGS

00:59:19.022 --> 00:59:21.524
WE'RE TRYING TO DO AS A- AS WELL

00:59:21.591 --> 00:59:23.192
AS WESTERN GROWERS I DO RUN

00:59:23.259 --> 00:59:24.160
WESTERN GROWERS CENTER FOR

00:59:24.227 --> 00:59:26.930
INNOVATION AND- AND TECHNOLOGY.

00:59:26.996 --> 00:59:28.364
I'M THE PROVERBIAL SALES BEEN

00:59:28.431 --> 00:59:29.866
MARRIED TO A FARMER'S DAUGHTER

00:59:29.933 --> 00:59:31.834
SO I WAS IN THE DEAL AS WE LIKE

00:59:31.901 --> 00:59:32.568
TO SAY IN SALINAS FOR THIRTY

00:59:32.635 --> 00:59:34.871
YEARS- AND I BELONG TO ALL OF

00:59:34.938 --> 00:59:36.506
THE GROUPS WHETHER IT'S PMA

00:59:36.572 --> 00:59:38.174
UNITED OR WESTERN GROWERS. AND

00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:39.309
WESTERN GROWERS IT'S SOMETHING I

00:59:39.375 --> 00:59:40.944
THINK PARTICULARLY IN THE

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:42.245
COMPLEX REPORT ABOUT FIVE OR SIX

00:59:42.312 --> 00:59:44.414
YEARS AGO. WHERE WHERE THEY

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:47.450
SAID. THEY SAID WE NEED TO JUMP

00:59:47.517 --> 00:59:48.985
INTO THE INNOVATION. AND

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:51.888
TECHNOLOGY AND BE PROACTIVE IN

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:54.524
RATHER THAN. REACTIVE TO THE

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:57.160
FUTURE. AND WHEN YOU WHEN YOU

00:59:57.226 --> 00:59:58.227
THINK ABOUT AG TECH AND THAT'S

00:59:58.294 --> 00:59:59.495
WHAT THAT'S REALLY ABOUT THAT

00:59:59.562 --> 01:00:02.966
PHRASE- YEAH CAN BE RENEWABLES%

01:00:03.032 --> 01:00:04.267
THAT CAN BE ROBOTICS THAT COULD

01:00:04.334 --> 01:00:06.002
BE SOFTWARE SERVICE. SO IT'S

01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:07.804
REAL IT'S REALLY KIND OF A KIND

01:00:07.870 --> 01:00:11.341
OF A CATCH ALL- AND WE- I MAKE

01:00:11.407 --> 01:00:13.376
NO DOUBT- EVEN THOUGH YOU VISIT

01:00:13.443 --> 01:00:15.011
ALL THOSE FORMS WE DO COMPETE A

01:00:15.078 --> 01:00:16.980
LITTLE BIT AMONGST OURSELVES BUT

01:00:17.046 --> 01:00:17.981
WE DO COOPERATE PRETTY WELL ON.

01:00:18.047 --> 01:00:20.049
TECHNICAL ISSUES REGULATORY

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:21.351
ISSUES AND FOOD SAFETY ISSUES

01:00:21.417 --> 01:00:25.621
AMONG WE RECOGNIZE. WHEN IT CAME

01:00:25.688 --> 01:00:28.157
TO TECHNOLOGY- AND THEN. THAT

01:00:28.224 --> 01:00:30.893
THAT'S- COOPERATE. WERE ALSO

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:33.029
BORN GOING TO MATTER. AND I

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:34.197
APPRECIATED YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:36.232
SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND IT MAY BE A

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:37.734
LITTLE COUNTER INTUITIVE BUT YOU

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.869
KNOW WESTERN GROWERS- OUR

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:42.438
MEMBERSHIP REPRESENTS YOU KNOW

01:00:42.505 --> 01:00:44.073
THE FIGURES YOU LAID OUT. ON

01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:45.708
AVERAGE TO DEPEND UPON THE CROP

01:00:45.775 --> 01:00:48.578
SOME 5260% OF NORTH AMERICA'S

01:00:48.644 --> 01:00:50.947
FRESH FRUIT AND VEGETABLE AND

01:00:51.014 --> 01:00:53.850
THAT PRODUCTION AND- NEARLY HALF

01:00:53.916 --> 01:00:55.018
OF THE ORGANIC PRODUCTION OF

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:58.821
THOSE CATEGORIES. AS WELL. AND

01:00:58.888 --> 01:01:00.423
WE'RE OPERATING IN SOME THIRTY

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.058
TWO STATES IN THIRTY COUNTRIES

01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:03.026
TO GET THAT DONE BECAUSE THE

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:04.560
MARKET PLACE EXPECTS US TO BE IN

01:01:04.627 --> 01:01:07.930
ON A- YEAR ROUND BASIS SO WE'RE

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:10.466
THE SPECIALTY CROP CROWD. IT'S A

01:01:10.533 --> 01:01:13.536
GLOBAL PLATFORM- IT MAY BE A

01:01:13.603 --> 01:01:15.304
LITTLE COUNTER INTUITIVE BUT-

01:01:15.371 --> 01:01:17.206
THERE'S- EVERYTHING YOU JUST.

01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:19.075
LAID OUT ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S TRUE

01:01:19.142 --> 01:01:22.045
THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE- WE HAVE

01:01:22.111 --> 01:01:25.114
ENORMOUS ADVANTAGES BUT BECAUSE-

01:01:25.181 --> 01:01:26.182
AND I'M SPEAKING AS THE

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:28.051
SPECIALTY CROP CROWD. A LOT OF

01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:31.120
THE THINGS WE NEED TO GET DONE.

01:01:31.187 --> 01:01:32.889
BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY CROPS.

01:01:32.955 --> 01:01:35.124
AND SO MUCH DIVERSITY WE DON'T

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:37.393
NECESSARILY HAVE THE SCALE WE

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:40.163
NEED TO GET CERTAIN THINGS DONE

01:01:40.229 --> 01:01:41.898
UNLESS WE WORK TOGETHER. SO I

01:01:41.964 --> 01:01:42.932
MAY BE A LITTLE COUNTER

01:01:42.999 --> 01:01:43.966
INTUITIVE BUT ONE OF THE WAYS TO

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:45.368
HELP THE SMALLER FARMERS PROTECT

01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:46.035
WE WANT TO COME TO THE

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:48.704
TECHNOLOGY. IS THAT THAT THE

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:51.974
LARGER PLAYERS. ARE GOOD AT GOOD

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:54.444
PLACE OF AGGREGATION TO GET SOME

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:56.779
TECHNOLOGY DON AND CREATE SCALE

01:01:56.846 --> 01:01:59.348
AND BATTLE WITH. THAT- THAT

01:01:59.415 --> 01:02:01.617
WORKS ON BEHALF OF EVERYBODY SO

01:02:01.684 --> 01:02:04.487
FOR INSTANCE- I DON'T AT. CAN

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:06.422
MENTIONED OUR GLOBAL HARVEST

01:02:06.489 --> 01:02:08.357
AUTOMATION. INITIATIVE ONE OF

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:10.359
THE THINGS WE FOUND OUT AS WE

01:02:10.426 --> 01:02:16.032
LOOKED AT. THE LABOR ISSUE. AT

01:02:16.099 --> 01:02:16.999
AS IT IS THAT. WE WERE DOING

01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:19.569
PRETTY IN CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES

01:02:19.635 --> 01:02:20.903
SUCH AS SPENDING ON WHEAT IN THE

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:23.106
MARKET PLACE WAS WORKING AS I

01:02:23.172 --> 01:02:24.907
LIKE TO TELL PEOPLE. THANK R.

01:02:24.974 --> 01:02:27.477
TWO D. TWO. REPETITIVE MOVIE

01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:29.378
MOVING UP AND DOWN FIELDS. BUT

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:30.313
WHEN YOU START THINKING ABOUT

01:02:30.379 --> 01:02:33.015
HARVEST CP THREE OUT I TALKING

01:02:33.082 --> 01:02:35.118
ABOUT REPLICATED EGGMAN BIT.

01:02:35.184 --> 01:02:37.053
DIFFERENT CONVERSATION MUCH

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.755
HIGHER LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY. AND

01:02:39.822 --> 01:02:41.624
DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE

01:02:41.691 --> 01:02:45.094
SCALE. CROP BY CROP. FOR A

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:49.565
CUSTOM AUTOMATION. SOLUTION SO

01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:50.967
ONE OF THE THINGS WE SAID WAS

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:52.201
WELL LET'S LOOK AT SOME

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:55.271
CALIFORNIA ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:57.073
. AND WE TOOK THE TOP DOZEN OR

01:02:57.140 --> 01:02:58.241
SO CROPS THAT WE GROW HERE AND

01:02:58.307 --> 01:03:01.210
SAID OKAY. ON AVERAGE WE ON A

01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:05.281
GLOBAL. SCALE WE REPRESENT LET'S

01:03:05.348 --> 01:03:06.916
SAY 50% OF THE MARKET GIVE OR

01:03:06.983 --> 01:03:08.851
TAKE SO THAT MEANS WE REPRESENT

01:03:08.918 --> 01:03:11.187
SCALE. SO PROOF OF CONCEPT HAS

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:13.222
TO HAPPEN HERE SO CALIFORNIA HAS

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:14.657
THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BE THE

01:03:14.724 --> 01:03:17.160
GLOBAL LANDING SPOT. FOR A LOT

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:19.128
OF TECHNOLOGY WE THINK THAT'S A

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:21.230
HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA.

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:23.833
FOR OUR INDUSTRY FOR RURAL RURAL

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:27.570
ECONOMIES AND SO WE AGGREGATED.

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:29.238
AND WHAT WE BASICALLY DID WAS WE

01:03:29.305 --> 01:03:31.674
LOOKED AT- SPECIALLY CRAFTED

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:32.808
SAID THREE THINGS ARE HAPPENING

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:34.610
YOU'RE GETTING THINGS OFF THE

01:03:34.677 --> 01:03:35.278
GROUND OUT OF A TREE A CLIP FROM

01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:38.114
A BY. NOW HOW DO YOU GET THAT

01:03:38.181 --> 01:03:39.849
DONE SO FOR INSTANCE ONE OF OUR-

01:03:39.916 --> 01:03:41.484
AND JUST PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE

01:03:41.551 --> 01:03:44.253
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S- FOOD FOR

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:45.621
THOUGHT A LITTLE BIT FOR ALL OF

01:03:45.688 --> 01:03:47.089
US. ONE OF OUR FAVORITE BRADLEY

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:49.125
GROWER SHIPPERS WE HAD AMAJOR

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:50.760
JAPANESE CORPORATION ROBOTICS

01:03:50.826 --> 01:03:52.562
PLAYER IN THE FIELD. THIS

01:03:52.628 --> 01:03:54.564
COMPANY REPRESENTED 25% OF THE

01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:55.932
U. S. BROCCOLI FLORETS

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:57.567
FOODSERVICE MARKET OPPORTUNITY

01:03:57.633 --> 01:03:58.634
AND I LOOK AT THE GIRL AND I

01:03:58.701 --> 01:04:00.069
SAID NOW TELL TELL THEM HOW MANY

01:04:00.136 --> 01:04:01.704
YOU'RE GOING TO BUY AND I

01:04:01.771 --> 01:04:02.371
THOUGHT THE ANSWER WAS GOING TO

01:04:02.438 --> 01:04:05.775
BE BIGGER. AND HE SAID TO. FIVE

01:04:05.841 --> 01:04:08.244
SO WHAT'S GREAT THE ADDRESSABLE

01:04:08.311 --> 01:04:09.812
MARKET IS TEN. TRUST ME WHEN I

01:04:09.879 --> 01:04:11.847
TELL YOU. DOWN THERE AND MAKE

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:15.618
INTO. SO NOW BUT- THAT'S ALSO

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:19.021
OUR OPPORTUNITY. BECAUSE WE

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:20.957
BECAUSE TO WILL GET MAY. THE

01:04:21.023 --> 01:04:23.092
QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU MARRY.

01:04:23.159 --> 01:04:25.494
SMALL NUMBERS WITH SOPHISTICATED

01:04:25.561 --> 01:04:27.563
TECHNOLOGY BUT THAT BECOMES OUR

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:30.566
OPPORTUNITY. AND IF AND YOU KNOW

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:32.702
SO WE THANK AND WE APPRECIATE

01:04:32.768 --> 01:04:36.472
CAN POINTING THIS UT THAT IF WE

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:38.307
CAN STEP IN AS INDUSTRY. AND

01:04:38.374 --> 01:04:42.078
PROVIDE CLEAR DIRECTION OF

01:04:42.144 --> 01:04:44.213
HERE'S WHAT WE NEED THAT'S

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.515
HELPFUL. AND THAT ACCELERATES

01:04:46.582 --> 01:04:47.984
ACCELERATES THE PROCESS SO

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.151
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THE

01:04:49.218 --> 01:04:50.820
GLOBAL HARVEST AUTOMATION

01:04:50.886 --> 01:04:52.321
INITIATIVE IS TRYING TO DO. I

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:54.056
RUN WESTERN GROWERS INNOVATION

01:04:54.123 --> 01:04:55.925
CENTER AND ORIGINALLY STARTED

01:04:55.992 --> 01:04:57.727
WITH A PRETTY SIMPLE IDEA LET'S

01:04:57.793 --> 01:04:59.962
GET TECHNOLOGY TOGETHER WITH

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:03.466
GROWERS AND- STUFF WILL HAPPEN

01:05:03.532 --> 01:05:05.635
REAL FAST RON. MUCH MUCH SLOWER

01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:07.803
PROCESS TAKES A LITTLE LONGER.

01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:08.938
THAN WE DAHLE PREFERRED SO WE

01:05:09.005 --> 01:05:12.074
REALIZED WE NEEDED TO START WORK

01:05:12.141 --> 01:05:13.109
MORE STRATEGICALLY. AND

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:15.478
INTENTIONALLY. AND IN THAT

01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:17.546
PROCESS IT BECAME VERY VERY

01:05:17.613 --> 01:05:21.050
CLEAR. THAT THE FOLKS. TO THE

01:05:26.322 --> 01:05:27.690
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. NEEDED TO

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:29.859
BE ADDRESSED SOONER RATHER THAN

01:05:29.925 --> 01:05:31.460
LATER. AND WE NEEDED TO BE

01:05:31.527 --> 01:05:33.462
INTENTIONAL AND WE NEED TO SEE

01:05:33.529 --> 01:05:35.564
IF WE COULD ACCELERATE THAT SO

01:05:35.631 --> 01:05:37.867
PART OF WHAT WE DO. AT WESTERN

01:05:37.933 --> 01:05:38.934

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:54.383
DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY WHAT

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:55.518
HAPPENS WHEN YOU READ THE TWO

01:05:55.584 --> 01:05:56.752
STICKS TOGETHER THE SALINAS

KAREN. AND THAT WITH THEM WHAT

01:06:28.918 --> 01:06:30.853
WAS REALLY KIND OF BORN OUT OF

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:33.522
THAT IS. CAN WHY DON'T WE- TAKE

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:35.224
A YEAR FOCUS. AND MOVE

01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:36.559
THROUGHOUT THE STATE USING

01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:37.927
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS THE

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:40.196
PLATFORM AN APP FOR

01:06:40.262 --> 01:06:42.298
CONVERSATIONS AND WE CHOSE

01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:45.034
COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR A REASON

01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:46.202
BECAUSE WE THINK THEY'RE THE

01:06:46.268 --> 01:06:50.139
PERFECT INTERSECTION. FOR ALL

CHAIN THEY'RE ALSO IN THE UP

01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:56.312
SKILLING BUSINESS OF PROVIDING

01:06:56.379 --> 01:06:58.848
CERTIFICATES THEY'RE A PERFECT

01:06:58.914 --> 01:07:02.051

FFA IS AND THAT SORT OF THING SO

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.595
WE THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE. THE

01:07:12.661 --> 01:07:15.131
PERFECT. VEHICLE TO DO SO WE

01:07:15.197 --> 01:07:16.999

THIS VERY CONVERSATION. AT IT

01:07:50.332 --> 01:07:51.700
AND IF YOU LOOK ON THE BACK PAGE

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:53.936
THE FORMAT IS BASED BASICALLY

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:55.204
THE SAME WE'RE GONNA BRING IN

01:07:55.271 --> 01:07:57.306
INDUSTRY. AND THEY'RE GOING TO

01:07:57.373 --> 01:08:00.042
SAY. THIS IS WHAT WE NEED LOUDLY

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:02.311
AND CLEARLY. THAT WE'RE GONNA

01:08:02.378 --> 01:08:03.078
BRING IN EDUCATION WORKFORCE

01:08:03.145 --> 01:08:05.881
DEVELOPMENT. AND SAY THIS IS

01:08:05.948 --> 01:08:09.919
WHAT WE'RE DOING OR INTENDED TO-

01:08:09.985 --> 01:08:11.787
AND THE IDEAS YOU KNOW THE

01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:14.089
REGIONAL COLLEGE. IS THE HOST

01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:15.624
BUT WE HAVE TO WE BRING IN THE

01:08:15.691 --> 01:08:16.892
OTHER PLAYERS CELESTIALS WAS

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:20.196
THERE- UC MERCED CAME DOWN THAT

01:08:20.262 --> 01:08:21.897
THAT TYPE OF THING- POM

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:23.332
WONDERFUL HAS A CHARTER SCHOOL

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:26.035
SO THE IDEA IS TO REPRESENT. THE

01:08:26.101 --> 01:08:28.237
YEAH YOU KNOW THE WHOLE AREA

01:08:28.304 --> 01:08:30.172
WHO'S DOING WHAT AND SO WE'LL

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:31.073
MOVE THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO DO

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.575
THAT AND THEN WE HAVE A CEO

01:08:32.641 --> 01:08:37.112
PANEL WHICH IS IMPORTANT. TO

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:38.314
SAVE ON BEHALF OF INDUSTRY

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:41.150
LEADERSHIP. AND THE SPEECH NEEDS

01:08:41.217 --> 01:08:41.984
TO BE GIVEN TO OURSELVES

01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:43.953
SOMETIMES IS INDUSTRY THIS IS

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:46.989
IMPORTANT. THIS NEEDS TO HAPPEN.

01:08:47.056 --> 01:08:49.058
AND WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF IT. AND

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.125
THEN AND THEN KAREN AND I'VE CAN

01:08:50.192 --> 01:08:51.293
FINISH UP WITH A WITH A

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:53.195
CONVERSATION. AND THESE ARE

01:08:53.262 --> 01:08:54.363
THESE ARE TWENTY FOUR HOUR

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:55.564
CYCLES AND THEN THE NEXT MORNING

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.800
WE WILL. SPEND TIME WITH

01:08:57.867 --> 01:08:59.435
GENERALLY STUDENTS BECAUSE WE

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:01.170
WANT TO WE WANT YOUNG PEOPLE TO

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:04.173
BE EXCITED ABOUT AG. BUT IT'S A

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:07.009
MUCH DEEPER. THAT THE PROPERTIES

01:09:07.076 --> 01:09:08.544
ARE BROADER DEEPER MORE ROBUST

01:09:08.611 --> 01:09:11.046
THAN THEY OFTEN OFTEN REALIZE

01:09:11.113 --> 01:09:15.751
SO- AND- THE IDEA WILL BE. WHAT

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:16.919
OF WHICH ONE WE GET BACK HERE TO

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:19.421
WOODLAND WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.423
AND WHERE THE GAPS WHAT DID WE

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:22.758
LEARN AND READ LIKE SO YOU'VE

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:24.226
ALREADY ASKED THE QUESTION HOW

01:09:24.293 --> 01:09:26.962
SOON DO WE START SO ONE OF THE-

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:28.831
SCHOOLS WE HAD UP THERE WAS THE

01:09:28.898 --> 01:09:31.500
MCFARLAND DISTRICT AND IF YOU

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:33.135
LIKE- KEVIN COSTNER TRACK. GUESS

01:09:33.202 --> 01:09:35.204
WHAT ONE OF HIS LEVY THIS WAS

01:09:35.271 --> 01:09:35.905
THEY HAVE A GREAT ROBOTICS

01:09:35.971 --> 01:09:37.039
PROGRAM AND SO THE

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:40.943
SUPERINTENDENT TOOK US THROUGH

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:42.778
AND KAREN HAVE THIS FOR THE

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:45.080
GRAMMAR SCHOOL THE MIDDLE SCHOOL

01:09:45.147 --> 01:09:46.582
BY HIGH SCHOOL THE GRAMMAR

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:50.219
SCHOOL HAS THREE MAKERSPACES. SO

01:09:50.286 --> 01:09:52.955
YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF YOUNG.

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:55.057
CHILDREN WHO WERE EXCITED MAKING

01:09:55.124 --> 01:09:56.492
THINGS AND ALREADY GETTING THAT

01:09:56.559 --> 01:09:58.060
STEM BASED EDUCATION SO WHAT DID

01:09:58.127 --> 01:09:59.728
WE LEARN START AS SOON AS

01:09:59.795 --> 01:10:00.863
POSSIBLE BUT ONE OF THE OTHER

01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:02.631
THINGS WE'RE LEARNING IS THERE'S

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:05.000
GOING TO BE A TEACHER GAP. WHO'S

01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:06.869
GONNA TEACH THIS STUFF. BECAUSE

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:08.938
YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF TERRIFIC.

01:10:09.004 --> 01:10:13.108
TEACHERS BUT THEY ARE YOU KNOW

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:14.476
YOU MENTIONED IRRIGATION THEY

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:15.077
MAY HAVE A BACKGROUND IN YOUR

01:10:15.144 --> 01:10:17.546
NATION THAT THAT THAT DOES NOT

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:18.881
NECESSARILY GETS READY TO GO TO

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:20.683
TALK TO TALK ABOUT ROBOTICS AND

01:10:20.749 --> 01:10:24.520
AI BUT BUT WE ALSO SO RELAY FOR

01:10:24.587 --> 01:10:26.622
INSTANCE IS BRINGING IN INDUSTRY

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:28.290
PEOPLE THEY FACILITATE THE

01:10:28.357 --> 01:10:30.159
CONVERSATION. TO START THE

01:10:30.225 --> 01:10:31.860
PROCESS BUT THIS ISSUE OF

01:10:31.927 --> 01:10:35.230
TEACHING. JOB SHADOWING. IT'S

01:10:35.297 --> 01:10:37.232
GOING TO BE AN ISSUE SO WHAT WE

01:10:37.299 --> 01:10:38.767
TRY TO DO IS FIGURE OUT WHERE

01:10:38.834 --> 01:10:39.902
THE ISSUE IS ONE OF THE GAPS

01:10:39.969 --> 01:10:41.570
WHAT ARE. WHAT ARE THE WHAT'S

01:10:41.637 --> 01:10:43.339
THE ACTUAL BANDWIDTH BECAUSE

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:45.040
BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A WORLD. OF

01:10:45.107 --> 01:10:48.277
SCALE- AS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:50.279
BOB SO. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WE

01:10:50.346 --> 01:10:52.047
GONNA NEED AND HOW WE THINK HOW

01:10:52.114 --> 01:10:54.350
DO WE FIGURE THIS OUT SO THOSE

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:56.919
ARE A COUPLE OF. TAKEAWAYS AND

01:10:56.986 --> 01:10:57.553
THEN THE OTHER THING I THINK YOU

01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:00.556
SHOULD. WILL BE BE. EXCITED

01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:01.757
ABOUT IT THEN I GOT A FEW PHONE

01:11:01.824 --> 01:11:02.791
CALLS AS YOU MIGHT IMAGINE HEY

01:11:02.858 --> 01:11:04.193
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T BITE ME AND-

01:11:04.259 --> 01:11:06.061

A LOT WELL YOU KNOW. THAT YOU

01:11:08.731 --> 01:11:11.400
CAN GET THE EVERYONE BUT- WE

01:11:11.467 --> 01:11:12.201
HEARD FROM SUCH A SMALL

01:11:12.267 --> 01:11:15.104
COMMUNITY. IN SANGER. THAT A

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:16.572
GROUP OF PARENTS. AND THE

01:11:16.639 --> 01:11:18.207
SCHOOL. GRAMMAR IN A GRAMMAR

01:11:18.273 --> 01:11:19.975
SCHOOL DISTRICT. THEY WANT TO

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:22.645
BUILD A CASE THROUGH AGE.

01:11:22.711 --> 01:11:25.814
DEDICATED GRAMMAR SCHOOL THAT IS

01:11:25.881 --> 01:11:27.883
SOLELY BASED ON ITS OWN IT'S

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:28.784
ALMOST LIKE A LAND GRANT

01:11:28.851 --> 01:11:29.918
UNIVERSITY WE'RE WE'RE GONNA

01:11:29.985 --> 01:11:31.954
HAVE THE EQUIVALENT OF A AG AT.

01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:33.622
GRAMMAR SCHOOL METAL BE

01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:36.825
FOUNDATIONAL THAT WAS PRETTY

01:11:36.892 --> 01:11:38.894
IMPRESSIVE IN PRETTY EXCITING.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.596
YOU KNOW THAT THE PRINCIPLE- YOU

01:11:40.663 --> 01:11:42.297
KNOW I COULD PUT HIM ON A SUNDAY

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:43.132
MORNING WITH ANY OF ANALYST

01:11:43.198 --> 01:11:46.035
PRETTY GOOD. OFF START THE KIDS

01:11:46.101 --> 01:11:47.169
YOUNG SO THOSE WERE THINGS WERE

01:11:47.236 --> 01:11:48.704
LEARNING AND FIND IT OUT SO IT'S

01:11:48.771 --> 01:11:50.339
VERY EXCITING TO MOVE THROUGH

01:11:50.406 --> 01:11:54.043
THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND- AND

01:11:54.109 --> 01:11:54.610
WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO REALLY

01:11:54.677 --> 01:11:55.477
BRING IT BACK. THAT KIND OF THAT

01:11:55.544 --> 01:11:57.846
COMPOSITE. PICTURE TO YOU ALL.

01:11:57.913 --> 01:12:00.783
BY THE TIME WE GET TO A- GET GET

01:12:00.849 --> 01:12:03.619
THE WOODLAND. SO THAT'S THE

01:12:03.686 --> 01:12:07.823
NATURE OF THE PROGRAM. WE ASKED

01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:10.526
THAT SAME QUESTION. YOU ASKED

01:12:10.592 --> 01:12:12.194
SEVERAL MONTHS AGO AND SAID HOW

01:12:12.261 --> 01:12:13.629
DO WE GET THAT KIND OF WORKERS

01:12:13.696 --> 01:12:14.496
BECAUSE OF BECAUSE WE KNOW WE

01:12:14.563 --> 01:12:15.864
HAVE TO HAVE THAT AND THE OTHER

01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:18.000
THING THAT TIPPED ME OFF WAS WE

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:19.134
STARTED TO GET A LOT OF YOUR-

01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:21.470
ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY. AND

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:22.304
THEY SAID WE CAN'T FIND SALES

01:12:22.371 --> 01:12:24.006
PEOPLE. OKAY SO I CAN MAKE

01:12:24.073 --> 01:12:25.908
STUFF. BUT IF I CAN'T GET IT

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:28.944
SOLD GET IT SERVICE SO SEVENTY

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.846
SO WE AND SO IT'S NOT JUST A

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:32.781
QUESTION OF. TECHNOLOGY IN A

01:12:32.848 --> 01:12:35.350
VACUUM YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:36.919
STUFF THAT GOES WITH IT. AND LET

01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:38.587
ME JUST CLOSE WITH THAT SINCE I

01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:39.788
LISTEN TO SOME OF YOUR COMMENTS

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:43.158
I AM A FORMER MAYOR AND- MY

01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:44.593
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY.

01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:46.862
CONSISTS SALINAS IS A RELATIVELY

01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:49.098
AT THE TIME. JUST BECAUSE OUR

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:50.933
STRUCTURAL BORDERS. WAS A

01:12:50.999 --> 01:12:52.901
RELATIVELY POOR CITY. IN TERMS

01:12:52.968 --> 01:12:55.804
OF- OUR OUR GENERAL FUND DOLLARS

01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:57.973
SO MY THOUGHT WAS OK HOW IF I

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.242
HANG OUT UP NORTH AND IT WAS A

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:04.513
CITY AVERAGE AGE OF TWENTY SIX.

01:13:04.580 --> 01:13:05.347
YEARS OLD HOW DO WE CREATE.

01:13:05.414 --> 01:13:08.350
OPPORTUNE THE OPPORTUNE. TO

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:10.953
BRING AG TACK. AND MAINTAIN THE

01:13:11.019 --> 01:13:14.123
HEALTH OF THE WORLD ECONOMY IS.

01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:16.792
IT IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE

01:13:16.859 --> 01:13:18.761
STATE. AND WHERE YOU HAVE A

01:13:18.827 --> 01:13:20.796
HEALTHY AG COMMUNITY. AND IF YOU

01:13:20.863 --> 01:13:21.897
THINK ABOUT ALL THE TRANSITIONS

01:13:21.964 --> 01:13:23.932
WERE GOING THROUGH WHETHER

01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:24.833
EXACT. THERE TENDS TO BE

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.635
EDUCATION THERE TENDS TO BE

01:13:26.702 --> 01:13:28.170
HEALTHCARE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:29.805
THINGS THAT TIME LINE UP WHEN AG

01:13:29.872 --> 01:13:32.074
IS HEALTHY. AND I AND I THINK WE

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:33.142
HAVE SOME HUGE OPPORTUNITIES

01:13:33.208 --> 01:13:36.345
FOR. CUSTOM MANUFACTURING. AND

01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:37.379
THEN I WOULD JUST SHARE AND I

01:13:37.446 --> 01:13:40.382
THINK GAVE MADE A TERRIFIC POINT

01:13:40.449 --> 01:13:42.184
. THERE IS WAY MORE TALENT THAN

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:44.753
I THINK PEOPLE SOMETIMES EXPECT

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:46.088
TO FIND IN THESE. IN THIS

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:48.090
COMMUNITY IN MONTANA AND- MY

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:50.526
DIRECT EXPERIENCE IS THE YOUNG

01:13:50.592 --> 01:13:52.795
PEOPLE WHOSE FAMILY HAS FARMED

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:54.630
WORKED IN THE FIELDS. HAVE THAT

01:13:54.696 --> 01:13:57.833
HAVE A MARVELOUS INTO IT SOUNDS.

01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.501
FOR AGRICULTURE. AND THE TRICK

01:13:59.568 --> 01:14:01.937
IS GETTING CITED ABOUT A FUTURE

01:14:02.004 --> 01:14:04.006
NAG AS OPPOSED TO WHAT I WANT TO

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:05.440
DO WITH MY FOLKS AND- GUESS WHAT

01:14:05.507 --> 01:14:06.074
THE FOLKS PROBABLY DON'T WANT

01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:08.010
YOU TO DO IT EITHER. YEAH BUT

01:14:08.076 --> 01:14:11.613
THEY BUT THAT THE BLACK. THERE

IS. SOMETHING TO BE GOING FROM

01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:14.249
THAT EXPERIENCE THAT THEY ALL

01:14:14.316 --> 01:14:16.485
HAD. AND IF WE CAN BUILD UPON

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:17.786
THAT COMMUNITY BY COMMUNITY I

01:14:17.853 --> 01:14:20.956

01:14:21.023 --> 01:14:22.925

NOWADAYS ARE NEVER WHO EVER

01:16:54.242 --> 01:16:57.212
THOUGHT OF GOING INTO THE ACT.

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:58.981
BUT THEY WILL THINK ABOUT TECH

01:16:59.047 --> 01:17:02.150
RIGHTRIGHT SO I'M THINKING HOW

01:17:02.217 --> 01:17:04.386
HOW DO WE HOW DO WE ENGAGE THAT

01:17:04.453 --> 01:17:06.955
ON A VOCATIONAL LEVEL. THAT'S

01:17:07.022 --> 01:17:08.890

. NOW FOR THAT NOT LATER NOW

01:17:20.068 --> 01:17:22.137
WELL I THINK I THINK THE STATE

01:17:22.204 --> 01:17:23.772
IS ALREADY DOING A LOT OF TRIPS

01:17:23.839 --> 01:17:24.806
TERRIFIC THINGS FOR INSTANCE I

01:17:24.873 --> 01:17:26.208
HAD A CHANCE TO VISIT WITH KAREN

01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:27.676
YESTERDAY AND I KNOW I KNOW

01:17:27.743 --> 01:17:29.311
THEY'RE STARTING TO BE DOLLARS

01:17:29.378 --> 01:17:30.545
AVAILABLE SPECIFICALLY FOR

01:17:30.612 --> 01:17:32.848
FARMWORKERS I THINK THAT'S-

01:17:32.914 --> 01:17:35.384
TERRIFIC- I DON'T THINK THERE'S

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.486
ANY QUESTION YOU ALL. WILL GET

01:17:37.552 --> 01:17:40.455
GREAT- ADVICE AND

01:17:40.522 --> 01:17:42.424
RECOMMENDATIONS WERE TO TARGET.

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:45.060
EDUCATE EDUCATIONAL DOLLARS BUT

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:46.094
BUT I WOULD TAKE VERY VERY

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:49.097
SERIOUSLY. HOW DO WE START- YANG

01:17:49.164 --> 01:17:51.700
BUT TO YOUR POINT. OUR CURRENT

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:55.203
WORK FORCE- AND UPSKILLING A

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:57.639
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND LABOUR

01:17:57.706 --> 01:17:59.541
DOLLARS AN APPRENTICESHIP

01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:03.412
OPPORTUNITIES. WE NEED TO BE ALL

01:18:03.478 --> 01:18:04.413
OVER THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO

01:18:04.479 --> 01:18:06.415
EXPAND THE PRODUCTIVE LIVES OF

01:18:06.481 --> 01:18:08.083
OUR CURRENT WORKFORCE WHERE

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:09.284
WHERE WHERE WE CAN'T AND THESE

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:12.154
TYPES OF JOBS ALSO WILL LEAD TO

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.022
. BETTER WORKING IT OUT BETTER

01:18:14.089 --> 01:18:15.791
WORKING CONDITIONS AND HIGHER

01:18:15.857 --> 01:18:18.126

LEARNING TRACK THAT I MEAN I

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.001
SUSPECT AT SOME LEVEL WE'RE ALL

01:18:26.068 --> 01:18:27.269
WAKING UP AND I UNDERSTAND AND

01:18:27.335 --> 01:18:28.637
I'M NOT THAT'S WHY THESE RURAL

01:18:28.703 --> 01:18:32.040
pCOLLEGES ARE PRETTY. ARE REALLY

01:18:32.107 --> 01:18:33.475
REALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE IT THEY

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:35.343
ARE THE PLACE YOU CAN MAKE THE

01:18:35.410 --> 01:18:36.111
CONNECTION THAT YOU KNOW IS

01:18:36.178 --> 01:18:38.880
BROADBAND COMES INTO PLAY HERE.

01:18:38.947 --> 01:18:40.015
PEOPLE HAVE GOT MORE USED OF

01:18:40.082 --> 01:18:42.217
WORKING ONLINE. AND YOU KNOW IF

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:44.786
YOU LOOK AT THE SAN JOAQUIN-

01:18:44.853 --> 01:18:45.954
ABOUT YOU KNOW AND I MEAN I

01:18:46.021 --> 01:18:47.689
BEGAN TO APPRECIATE IT A LITTLE

01:18:47.756 --> 01:18:49.324
BIT MORE AS A MAYOR BECAUSE YOU

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:50.492
CAN ALWAYS HEAR TWENTY EIGHT

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:51.359
CITIES AND HOW DOES THAT WORK

01:18:51.426 --> 01:18:52.194
AND THEN WHEN YOU GET OVERSIGHT

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:54.162
SPENDING TIME AND SEE. HOW THAT

01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:56.231
REGION FUNCTIONS BUT YOU KNOW IF

01:18:56.298 --> 01:18:58.967
YOU'RE WORKING AND RELATE. YOU

01:18:59.034 --> 01:18:59.768

01:18:59.835 --> 01:19:02.104
HOME. HELLO MORE SOMEWHERE ELSE

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:03.538
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO

01:19:03.605 --> 01:19:05.373
BACK TO THAT SOMEWHERE. WHAT AT

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.075
NIGHT IF RIDLEY HAPPEN YOU CAN

01:19:07.142 --> 01:19:09.344
DO IT ONLINE SO I THINK THIS

01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:11.346
ISSUE OF ACCESSIBILITY. IN TERMS

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:13.281
OF EDUCATION LIFELONG LEARNING

01:19:13.348 --> 01:19:15.884
AND A REAL REAL FOCUS ON CURRENT

01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:18.820
WORK FORCE. IS IMPORTANT I BUT I

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:20.755
ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE. YOU KNOW

01:19:20.822 --> 01:19:22.924
WITH WITH BROADLY KNOW WHAT TO

01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:24.559
DO THE ISSUE BECOMES ARE WE

01:19:24.626 --> 01:19:28.396
DOING IT ON SCALE ON A

01:19:28.463 --> 01:19:30.165
SUSTAINABLE BASIS. REALLY YOU

01:19:30.232 --> 01:19:31.600
KNOW IT'S THE SO IT'S STRUCTURE

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:34.436
SCALE. SUSTAINABILITY SPILLED AT

01:19:34.503 --> 01:19:35.470
THE SENSIBILITY OF NUMBERS

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:37.139
ENOUGH. I'LL GIVE YOU A VERY

01:19:37.205 --> 01:19:38.607
SIMPLE EXAMPLE WHEN I WAS THE

01:19:38.673 --> 01:19:42.410
MAYOR. WE HAD- YEAH WE HAD SOME

01:19:42.477 --> 01:19:43.411
YOUTH VIOLENCE CHALLENGES IN THE

01:19:43.478 --> 01:19:44.412
CITY AND WE WANT TO THE BOYS AND

01:19:44.479 --> 01:19:45.881
GIRLS CLUB AND THEY WERE GOING

01:19:45.947 --> 01:19:47.282
TO GO INTO A DIFFERENT ZIP CODE.

01:19:47.349 --> 01:19:50.185
AND THEY COULD SERVICE FOUR

01:19:50.252 --> 01:19:52.420
HUNDRED. CATS OF LIKE WHAT'S

01:19:52.487 --> 01:19:54.389
GREAT I GOT SIX THOUSAND

01:19:54.456 --> 01:19:55.824
TEENAGERS IN THAT ZIP CODE. THE

01:19:55.891 --> 01:19:57.225
SERVICE FOUR HUNDRED WE KNEW

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:59.094
WHAT TO DO. BUT IT WASN'T

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:02.164
SUFFICIENT. SCALE ON BANDWIDTH

01:20:02.230 --> 01:20:05.133
SO I'M I'M KIND OF A- I MEAN I'M

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:08.370
REALLY BULLISH ON THIS IDEA OF.

01:20:08.436 --> 01:20:08.970
NOT JUST STRATEGY GET NUMBERS

01:20:09.037 --> 01:20:11.239
AROUND. AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE

01:20:11.306 --> 01:20:12.707
CAPACITY WHAT'S THE DEMAND THEM

01:20:12.774 --> 01:20:15.110
AND UNDERSTAND THAT BUT BUT I

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:16.878
THINK YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.

01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:20.081

01:20:20.148 --> 01:20:23.218
LIFE GET UP I THINK. YOU'VE GOT

01:20:26.188 --> 01:20:27.889
LIKE APPRENTICESHIPS BUT I'LL

01:20:27.956 --> 01:20:29.124
TELL YOU THE ONE THING I WOULD

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:30.525
REALLY TAKE VERY VERY SERIOUSLY

01:20:30.592 --> 01:20:32.794
THERE'S GONNA BE A TEACHER ISSUE

01:20:32.861 --> 01:20:33.762
. THE PROPOSAL IS GOING TO TEACH

01:20:33.828 --> 01:20:35.297
THE STUFF AND I GREW TO AND THAT

01:20:35.363 --> 01:20:37.098
AND THAT I THINK THAT'S GOT TO

01:20:37.165 --> 01:20:37.933
BE ADDRESSED AND YEAH THAT IS NO

01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:39.234
REFLECTION ON THE TEACHING

01:20:39.301 --> 01:20:42.737
RECORD IN PLACE IT'S JUST. THE

01:20:42.804 --> 01:20:44.472
JOBS OF TOMORROW OR THE JOBS OF

01:20:44.539 --> 01:20:46.708
TOMORROW. HE ALSO HAS A LIVES

01:20:46.775 --> 01:20:48.043
ARE GONNA REQUIRE NEW SKILLS AS

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:49.144
ANY I DON'T HAVE GOOD TASTE

01:20:49.211 --> 01:20:51.880
FOCUS ON RETRAINING FOR EXAMPLE

01:20:51.947 --> 01:20:53.615
ALSO ARE ALREADY IN THE CAREER

01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:56.151
YEAH. IN THE MID CAREER RIGHT

01:20:56.218 --> 01:20:58.119
YEAH AND FRANKLY I THINK A LOT

01:20:58.186 --> 01:21:01.556
OF TEACHERS WOULD BE EXCITED TO

01:21:01.623 --> 01:21:02.557
DO SOMETHING NEW. YOU KNOW SO IT

01:21:02.624 --> 01:21:04.259
THAT IF SAME PER. COULD APPLY

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:06.494
THERE. YOU KNOW YOU KNOW IT'S

01:21:06.561 --> 01:21:09.231
HELPFUL. TO GET FOLKS WHO ARE

01:21:09.297 --> 01:21:11.266
FAMILIAR WITH THE TERRAIN. THEN

01:21:11.333 --> 01:21:13.068
CAN WE GET THEM EXCITED ABOUT

01:21:13.134 --> 01:21:13.835
THE WEATHER TO PROVIDE

GOLDEN STATE CALIFORNIA. THIS IS

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:24.032
SAY CALPERS ICONIC WINE INDUSTRY

01:23:24.099 --> 01:23:25.834
IS PROUD OF OUR RICH HERITAGE.

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:27.535
AND A CONTRIBUTIONS THIS AMAZING

01:23:27.602 --> 01:23:29.237
STATE AND OUR NATION. WITH THAT

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:30.038
IN MIND THIS MORNING I'LL

01:23:30.105 --> 01:23:31.773
DISCUSS TWO ISSUES RELATIVE TO

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:33.908
THE IMPORTANCE OF TECHNOLOGY. IN

01:23:33.975 --> 01:23:35.610
CALIFORNIA'S WINE INDUSTRY.

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:36.845
FIRST ALL DISCUSSED THE NEED TO

01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:38.613
SHIFT TO MORE AUTOMATION AND

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.415
MECHANISATION IN VINEYARD

01:23:40.482 --> 01:23:41.816
MANAGEMENT. AND THEY'LL DISCUSS

01:23:41.883 --> 01:23:43.418
THE CHALLENGES AROUND MAKING

01:23:43.485 --> 01:23:45.587
THAT SHIFT. FIRST TO UNDERSTAND

01:23:45.653 --> 01:23:46.888
THE NEED TO SHIFT TO AUTOMATION

01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:48.690
AND MCAT AND MECHANIZATION NEED

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:50.225
TO CAREFULLY LOOK AT OUR

01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:52.060
EXISTING WORKFORCE CHALLENGES.

01:23:52.127 --> 01:23:52.894
THERE COULD BE NO QUESTION THAT

01:23:52.961 --> 01:23:55.063
CALIFORNIA'S VINEYARDS WORKFORCE

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:57.031
IS SHRINKING. AND ANNUAL SURVEY

01:23:57.098 --> 01:23:59.134
VIDEO OWNERS 54% WAS A LABOR

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.402
SHORTAGE AND COST IS ONE OF THE

01:24:00.468 --> 01:24:02.303
MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES TWENTY

01:24:02.370 --> 01:24:04.105
TWENTY. AND TWENTY NINETEEN

01:24:04.172 --> 01:24:04.973
LABOR SHORTAGE ACROSS WERE

01:24:05.039 --> 01:24:08.143
NUMBER ONE OVERALL CONCERN FOR

01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:09.144
WHITE GRAPE GROWERS. THERE'S

01:24:09.210 --> 01:24:10.378
SEVERAL REASONS FOR THAT CONCERN

01:24:10.445 --> 01:24:12.247
BUT I WANT TO BE CLEAR THIS IS

01:24:12.313 --> 01:24:14.015
NOT AN ISSUE OF A SHORTAGE OF

01:24:14.082 --> 01:24:16.117
GOOD PAYING JOBS. ANY ASSERTION

01:24:16.184 --> 01:24:18.253
OF THAT FAILS TO RECOGNIZE DATA

01:24:18.319 --> 01:24:20.989
AND FACTS. FOR EXAMPLE SOME

01:24:21.055 --> 01:24:22.290
NORTH COAST BEEN YEARS THIS YEAR

01:24:22.357 --> 01:24:24.459
PAID AS MUCH AS THIRTY DOLLARS

01:24:24.526 --> 01:24:25.927
PER HOUR DURING HARVEST. AND

01:24:25.994 --> 01:24:27.328
THEY STILL CANNOT FIND ENOUGH

01:24:27.395 --> 01:24:29.197
PEOPLE TO DO THE WORK. THAT'S

01:24:29.264 --> 01:24:31.366
THE PUBLIC TO SIXTY THREE

01:24:31.433 --> 01:24:31.900
THOUSAND DOLLARS AN ANNUAL

01:24:31.966 --> 01:24:34.469
SALARY. ADDITIONALLY COMPETITION

01:24:34.536 --> 01:24:36.271
FOR LABOR FROM OTHER INDUSTRIES

01:24:36.337 --> 01:24:38.473
IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. MANY

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:40.308
PEOPLE JUST DON'T WANT TO WORK

01:24:40.375 --> 01:24:41.776
IN AGRICULTURE ANYMORE MANY AG

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:43.144
WORKERS CAN FIND EMPLOYMENT IN

01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:45.480
OTHER INDUSTRIES WHERE THE WORK

01:24:45.547 --> 01:24:47.782
IS LESS DEMANDING. PHYSICALLY

01:24:47.849 --> 01:24:48.950
DEMANDING WE CAN ALSO SEE A

01:24:49.017 --> 01:24:50.685
SHORTAGE WE ALSO SEASHORES A

01:24:50.752 --> 01:24:52.387
SEASONAL LABOR DUE TO FEDERAL

01:24:52.454 --> 01:24:53.988
IMMIGRATION POLICIES AND THE

01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:56.224
STATE'S EFFORTS TO MAKE IT MORE

01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:57.459
DIFFICULT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:24:57.525 --> 01:24:58.660
H. TWO A. GUEST ADVOCATE

01:24:58.726 --> 01:25:01.729
PROGRAM. FOR MOST OF OUR GROWERS

01:25:01.796 --> 01:25:03.264
THAT PROGRAM IS TOO EXPENSIVE

01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:04.632
AND IT'S A BIT CANNOT AFFORD

01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:06.234
IT'S JUST NOT REALISTIC. BUT FOR

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:07.302
THOSE BUT FOR THOSE GROCERY

01:25:07.368 --> 01:25:09.904
CAPITA TO PAY. THOSE EMPLOYERS

01:25:09.971 --> 01:25:11.773
PROVIDE FREE TRANSPORTATION FREE

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.142
HOUSING COMPARED OF BENEFITS AND

01:25:14.209 --> 01:25:16.044
WAGES. AND DO ALL THAT TO

01:25:16.110 --> 01:25:17.679
ATTRACT EMPLOYEES ANOTHER

01:25:17.745 --> 01:25:19.113
CHALLENGE FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE

01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:19.981
VINEYARDS ARE OFTEN

01:25:20.048 --> 01:25:22.217
GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED SITUATED

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:24.219
ERRORS ARE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR

01:25:24.285 --> 01:25:26.387
CRYSTAL THEM. IN A COMMUNITY

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:27.755
KEEP IN MIND THE VINEYARDS ARE

01:25:27.822 --> 01:25:30.625
RURAL INDUSTRY AND OFTEN AND NOT

01:25:30.692 --> 01:25:32.193
CLOSE TO POPULATION CENTERS.

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:33.928
THIS B. AS A REPLACEMENT DRIVE

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:35.964
LONG DISTANCES TO GET TO WORK IS

01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:37.732
WELL DOCUMENTED THAT TOO MANY

01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:40.602
AGGRAVATE OVERCROWDED HOUSING.

01:25:40.668 --> 01:25:42.036
THE THEY CANNOT FIND OF HOUSING

01:25:42.103 --> 01:25:43.938
IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SO THEY

01:25:44.005 --> 01:25:45.607
SCRAMBLE INTO THE BEST THEY CAN.

01:25:45.673 --> 01:25:47.575
WITH THIS REALITY IN MIND MANY

01:25:47.642 --> 01:25:49.077
GROWERS WANT TO HELP AB WORKERS

01:25:49.143 --> 01:25:50.712
BY PROVIDING HOUSING FOR THEIR

01:25:50.778 --> 01:25:52.947
EMPLOYEES. BUT THIS IS A

01:25:53.014 --> 01:25:54.215
UNBELIEVABLY CHALLENGING ISSUE

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:55.984
IN CALIFORNIA THIS CALIFORNIA

01:25:56.050 --> 01:25:57.385
LAW MAKES INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT

01:25:57.452 --> 01:25:59.254
TO BUILD HOUSING. MORE RECENTLY

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.522
COVERED RESTRICTIONS FOR HOUSING

01:26:00.588 --> 01:26:03.091
TREAT A HOUSE LIKE A WORKPLACE

01:26:03.157 --> 01:26:05.059
MAKING IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO

01:26:05.126 --> 01:26:06.961
PROVIDE HOUSING. DISCOLORATIONS

01:26:07.028 --> 01:26:08.296
DON'T RECOGNIZE AN EMPLOYER

01:26:08.363 --> 01:26:09.998
PROVIDED HOUSING IS INSPECTED

01:26:10.064 --> 01:26:13.601
ANNUALLY IS SAFE AND AS HEALTHY

01:26:13.668 --> 01:26:14.102
. WHERE THE STATE IS AN

01:26:14.168 --> 01:26:16.037
OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH

01:26:16.104 --> 01:26:17.038
EMPLOYERS AND INDUSTRY TO

01:26:17.105 --> 01:26:18.940
PROVIDE HOUSING THE STATE HAS

01:26:19.007 --> 01:26:20.308
INSTEAD MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT.

01:26:20.375 --> 01:26:21.843
LABOR SHORTAGES THAT THE ENTIRE

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:24.045
PROBLEM ANOTHER CONSIDERATION OF

01:26:24.112 --> 01:26:25.980
FACTORS TECHNOLOGY IS INCREASING

01:26:26.047 --> 01:26:27.849
SIZE OF CALIFORNIA VINEYARDS.

01:26:27.916 --> 01:26:29.017
THE AVERAGE CALIFORNIA VINEYARD

01:26:29.083 --> 01:26:32.053
IS APPROACHING CLOSE TO TWO

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.254

BUSINESS CANNOT PRACTICALLY BE

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:39.327
MANAGED WITH LABOR MANUAL LABOR

01:26:39.394 --> 01:26:42.030
ALONE. IS ALSO INTERESTING TO

01:26:42.096 --> 01:26:43.398
NOTE THE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE

01:26:43.464 --> 01:26:44.666
MECHANIZATION OF MEDICATIONS

01:26:44.732 --> 01:26:46.000
IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE

01:26:46.067 --> 01:26:47.869
GRAPES. AND THE CONSISTENCY OF

01:26:47.936 --> 01:26:49.737
THE GREAT FROM BLOCK TO BLOCK

01:26:49.804 --> 01:26:51.072
WITHIN THE VINEYARD. SO THE NEED

01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:53.107
IS CLEAR WE NEED TO MOVE TOWARDS

01:26:53.174 --> 01:26:54.375
GREATER USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN

01:26:54.442 --> 01:26:56.244
VINEYARDS. THAT FACT IS WITHOUT

01:26:56.311 --> 01:26:58.346
QUESTION. THEREFORE LET ME

01:26:58.413 --> 01:26:59.781
ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES. IN

01:26:59.847 --> 01:27:02.617
MAKING THE SHIFT TO AUTOMATION

01:27:02.684 --> 01:27:04.018
AND MECHANISATION. THE

01:27:04.085 --> 01:27:04.986
MECHANIZATION CALIFORNIA

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:06.120
VINEYARDS BEGAN MORE THAN FIFTY

01:27:06.187 --> 01:27:07.255
YEARS AGO WITH THE CHEMICAL

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:10.258
HARVESTING GRAPES TODAY 90% OF

01:27:10.325 --> 01:27:11.025
CALIFORNIA'S VINEYARDS ARE

01:27:11.092 --> 01:27:12.427
MECHANICALLY HARVESTED AND

01:27:12.493 --> 01:27:13.795
THERE'S BEEN A MAJOR FOCUS OF

01:27:13.861 --> 01:27:16.931
MECHANIZATION. HOWEVER

01:27:16.998 --> 01:27:17.865
HARVESTING IS JUST THE START.

01:27:17.932 --> 01:27:19.367
COMING TO MAKE IT AS PRACTICES

01:27:19.434 --> 01:27:21.302
CAN ALSO INCLUDE PRUNING SHOOT

01:27:21.369 --> 01:27:23.071
THINNING BASIL LEAF REMOVAL

01:27:27.775 --> 01:27:29.077
MECHANICALLY PRE PROVEN WELL

01:27:29.143 --> 01:27:32.046
OTHER PRACTICES DO NOT USE AS

01:27:32.113 --> 01:27:33.514
MUCH MECHANIZATION FOR EXAMPLE

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:35.350
ONLY 45% OF VINEYARDS HAVE

01:27:35.416 --> 01:27:38.319
MECHANIZED LEAF REMOVAL 7% HAVE

01:27:38.386 --> 01:27:40.822
MECHANIZED SHOOTING. ONLY 7% OF

01:27:40.888 --> 01:27:42.190
VINEYARDS HAVE FRUIT REMOVAL

01:27:42.256 --> 01:27:45.660
ONLY 2% OF IN YEARS HI SHOOT

01:27:45.727 --> 01:27:47.395
POSITIONING. RAP ADVANCES IN

01:27:47.462 --> 01:27:49.330
MACINNES OF ALSO OCCUR DUE TO

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:51.766
THE COEVOLUTION OF MACHINES BY

01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:52.867
TRADING SYSTEMS AND BEEN YOUR

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:54.636

DEVELOPMENT. OF INTEGRATED

01:27:57.305 --> 01:27:58.873
PRODUCTION SYSTEMS. CURRENT

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.141
MECHANIZATION RESEARCH IN

01:28:00.208 --> 01:28:01.676
CALIFORNIA IS FOCUSED ON THE

01:28:01.743 --> 01:28:02.910
DEVELOPMENT OF AUTOMATED CROP

01:28:02.977 --> 01:28:04.746
LOAD MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES

01:28:04.812 --> 01:28:06.848
UTILIZING SENSORY TECHNOLOGY

01:28:06.914 --> 01:28:08.549
SIMULTANEOUSLY MEASURE AND

01:28:08.616 --> 01:28:11.953
MANAGE CANOPY AND CROPSCIENCE.

01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:13.054
PLEASE REMEMBER THOUGH THAT THE

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:15.089
CUSTOMISATION IS NOT CHEAP FOR

01:28:15.156 --> 01:28:16.491
SOME GROWERS IT COULD TAKE FIVE

01:28:16.557 --> 01:28:18.059
TO TEN YEARS TO PAY OFF THAT

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:19.560
INVESTMENT. KEEP IN MIND THAT

01:28:19.627 --> 01:28:20.328
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF

01:28:20.395 --> 01:28:21.863
CALIFORNIA FARMERS WITH BONE

01:28:21.929 --> 01:28:24.265
YARDS BEHIND THE SHOP FEEL WITH

01:28:24.332 --> 01:28:25.133
THE BENCHES THAT JUST DIDN'T

01:28:25.199 --> 01:28:27.468
WORK OUT OVER A COMPLETE LOSS.

01:28:27.535 --> 01:28:29.070
ADDITIONALLY THERE'S A COST OF

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:30.338
THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT

01:28:30.405 --> 01:28:32.907
THAT TECHNOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE IF

01:28:32.974 --> 01:28:34.042
YOU'RE MOVING FROM DIESEL TO

01:28:34.108 --> 01:28:35.410
ELECTRIC THAT MEANS UPGRADING

01:28:35.476 --> 01:28:37.278
YOUR LEFT WILL CHARGING CAPACITY

01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:39.013
THIS MAY INCLUDE SOLAR PANELS

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.481
AND POWER STORAGE THIS COULD

01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:42.250
ALSO INCLUDE GENERATORS THAT

01:28:42.316 --> 01:28:43.951
COULD BE USED IN REMOTE AREAS.

01:28:44.018 --> 01:28:45.653
THIS ALSO MEANS SERVICING THE

01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.188
NEW ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT SOME

01:28:47.255 --> 01:28:48.823
ROADS WE NEED A HIGHER ELECTRIC

01:28:48.890 --> 01:28:50.892
MOTOR MECHANICS OR TECHNICIANS

01:28:50.958 --> 01:28:52.326
VERSES TRADITIONAL DIESEL

01:28:52.393 --> 01:28:54.862
MECHANICS. ADDITIONALLY IF A

01:28:54.929 --> 01:28:56.030
GIRL WANTS TO RETROFIT AN

01:28:56.097 --> 01:28:57.365
EXISTING TRACTOR TO BECOME A

01:28:57.432 --> 01:28:59.400
THOMAS THIS IS A ONE TIME

01:28:59.467 --> 01:29:00.635
INVESTMENT OF THE HARDWARE TO DO

01:29:00.702 --> 01:29:02.637
THAT AND THEN I'M GOING ANNUAL

01:29:02.704 --> 01:29:04.605
PAYMENT OF THE SOFTWARE THIS

01:29:04.672 --> 01:29:08.342
QUICKLY GETS IN THE TENS. OF

01:29:08.409 --> 01:29:09.077
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS PER TRACTOR

01:29:09.143 --> 01:29:10.011
. ON THE PLUS SIDE THOUGH

01:29:10.078 --> 01:29:11.946
MECHANIZATION REDUCE THE DEMAND

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:13.981
FOR LABOR. WHEN A GROWER SPACE

01:29:14.048 --> 01:29:15.349
OF NOT ENOUGH A PLACE TO DO THE

01:29:15.416 --> 01:29:16.951
WORK MECHANIZATION CAN BE A

01:29:17.018 --> 01:29:19.087
LIFESAVER. MECHANICAL PUTTING

01:29:19.153 --> 01:29:19.987
FOR EXAMPLE A LUMINOUS A DAY FOR

01:29:20.054 --> 01:29:21.456
LABOR BY AS MUCH AS EIGHTY

01:29:21.522 --> 01:29:23.157
PERCENT. MECHANICAL PUTTING

01:29:23.224 --> 01:29:25.059
COULD SAVE BETWEEN 6280% OF

01:29:25.126 --> 01:29:28.329
LABOR OPERATION COST PER ACRE.

01:29:28.396 --> 01:29:29.731
COMPARED TO MANUAL PRUNING.

01:29:29.797 --> 01:29:31.232
HOWEVER THIS IS JUST DOT THIS IS

01:29:31.299 --> 01:29:33.634
NOT JUST ACROSS ISSUE WE ALSO

01:29:33.701 --> 01:29:35.169
CREATING HIGHER PAYING JOBS.

01:29:35.236 --> 01:29:36.971
WITH MECHANIZATION WITH ON THE

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:38.339
JOB TRAINING AND THE CONDITION

01:29:38.406 --> 01:29:40.208
OF TECHNOLOGY EMPLOYERS HAVE

01:29:40.274 --> 01:29:41.843
INCREASED OPPORTUNITIES TO GET

01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:44.078
THE NECESSARY SKILLS. FOR THOSE

01:29:44.145 --> 01:29:45.246
HIGHER PAYING POSITIONS.

01:29:45.313 --> 01:29:46.981
EMPLOYERS CAN CLIMB THE LADDER

01:29:47.048 --> 01:29:48.750

01:29:50.351 --> 01:29:52.220
SYSTEM MAY NOT A PROVIDER FOR

01:29:52.286 --> 01:29:54.322
THEM. IS ALSO INTERESTING TO

01:29:54.388 --> 01:29:55.957
NOTE. THE MECHANIZATION CAN

01:29:56.023 --> 01:29:57.892
INCREASE THE INCOME OF THE

01:29:57.959 --> 01:30:00.094
WORKER. KEEP IN MIND THE GRAPES

01:30:00.161 --> 01:30:01.262
TAKE THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME TO

01:30:01.329 --> 01:30:03.030
MANAGE REGARDLESS OF THE MOTIVE

01:30:03.097 --> 01:30:04.065
MANAGEMENT. WELL WITH

01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:06.067
MECHANIZATION A GIRL CAN GET

01:30:06.134 --> 01:30:07.802
MORE DONE WITH FEWER PEOPLE.

01:30:07.869 --> 01:30:09.837
THOSE EMPLOYERS ARE GETTING MORE

01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:11.672
HOURS WITH GREATER INCOME.

01:30:11.739 --> 01:30:13.341
CONSEQUENTLY WITH THE DECLINING

01:30:13.407 --> 01:30:15.743
AG WORKFORCE MECHANIZATION MEANS

01:30:15.810 --> 01:30:19.914
LESS LABOR INTENSIVE WORK. AND

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:21.048
HIGHER LEVELS OF INCOME. MEG IS

THE FOLLOWING. WE CAN SAVE WATER

01:33:19.093 --> 01:33:20.795
BY USING THIS TECHNOLOGY TO

01:33:20.861 --> 01:33:21.862
MEASURE WHEN AND WHERE

01:33:21.929 --> 01:33:23.831
IRRIGATION IS NEEDED. WE CAN

01:33:23.898 --> 01:33:25.232
REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT BY

01:33:25.299 --> 01:33:26.934
MOVING FROM DIESEL TO ELECTRIC.

01:33:27.001 --> 01:33:27.868
WE CAN REDUCE THE USE OF

01:33:27.935 --> 01:33:29.804
PESTICIDES THEY USE THIS

01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:32.139
TECHNOLOGY TO CLOSELY MONITOR

01:33:32.206 --> 01:33:33.474

OF OUR CURRENT TECHNOLOGY. THOSE

01:33:51.792 --> 01:33:52.927
REGULATIONS ALSO SERVE AS A

HELP DISPOSE OF OLD VINES

01:34:27.995 --> 01:34:29.663
WITHOUT BURNING THEM. THIS IS A

01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:31.465
HUGE ISSUE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN

01:34:31.532 --> 01:34:32.566

ABOUT THE VINES OF THE OLD VINES

01:35:22.016 --> 01:35:23.384
THEY'RE STACKED UP ALTHOUGH A

01:35:23.451 --> 01:35:25.086
RECENT TOUR DOWN THE VALLEY AND

01:35:25.152 --> 01:35:26.520
I SAW STACKS AND STACKS OF OLD

01:35:26.587 --> 01:35:28.789
LINE'S BEEN TORN UP AS WELL AS

01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:30.458
TREES BECAUSE THEY ONLY HAVE A

01:35:30.524 --> 01:35:32.460
CERTAIN LIFE SPAN THEY DON'T

01:35:32.526 --> 01:35:35.429
LAST FOREVER NOT FOREVER THEY

01:35:35.496 --> 01:35:36.497
KEEP STACKING UP AND THAT'S

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:37.364
REALLY BEEN A BIG ISSUE FOR YOU

01:35:37.431 --> 01:35:39.500

HAVE SOME GRANT PROGRAMS

01:35:55.216 --> 01:35:55.916
AVAILABLE TO HELP GROWERS IN THE

01:35:55.983 --> 01:35:57.818
SHORT TERM BUT THE LONG TERM WE

01:35:57.885 --> 01:35:59.186
STILL TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS

01:35:59.253 --> 01:36:01.222
TO DEAL WITH- WITH WHAT WE DO

01:36:01.288 --> 01:36:03.157
TAKE OUT OF AND I'LL SPEAK TO

01:36:03.224 --> 01:36:04.325
THE VENUE PART OF IT- THE OTHER

01:36:04.391 --> 01:36:06.093
PROVIDERS HAVE ISSUES AS WELL.

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:08.596
BUT REMEMBER WHEN YOU TAKE OUT A

01:36:08.662 --> 01:36:09.897
VINEYARD THE VINEYARD HAS HAS

01:36:09.964 --> 01:36:11.632
SHOP LIKE A TWENTY FIVE THIRTY

01:36:11.699 --> 01:36:12.299
YEARS WHATEVER IT IS AND NOW

01:36:12.366 --> 01:36:14.034
IT'S NOT PRODUCING ANYMORE WHEN

01:36:14.101 --> 01:36:15.369
YOU TAKE IT DOWN YOU TAKE OUT

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:16.570
EVERYTHING THAT'S PART OF IT SO

01:36:16.637 --> 01:36:18.873
ALL OF THAT METAL THAT IS THOSE

01:36:18.939 --> 01:36:21.275
INSIDE THE BANK COMES DOWN AND

01:36:21.342 --> 01:36:22.910
YOU CAN'T PULL IT OUT OF THE-

01:36:22.977 --> 01:36:23.978
OUT OF OUT OF OUT OF THE BY

01:36:24.044 --> 01:36:26.280
BECAUSE IT'S TOO LABOR INTENSIVE

01:36:26.347 --> 01:36:27.414
SO ALL THAT GOES INTO A BIG

01:36:27.481 --> 01:36:29.250
STACK. YOU CAN'T BE A CHIP THAT

01:36:29.316 --> 01:36:31.619
YOU CAN'T BECAUSE OF THE METAL

01:36:31.685 --> 01:36:33.888
AND IT YOU CAN'T BURN IT BECAUSE

01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:35.422
WERE MOVING QUITE ACT BURN SO

01:36:35.489 --> 01:36:36.423
THAT LEAVES YOU WITH VERY FEW

01:36:36.490 --> 01:36:38.025
OPTIONS AND WE NEED TO REALLY

01:36:38.092 --> 01:36:40.928
PURSUE A SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM

01:36:40.995 --> 01:36:42.863
SOLUTION TO THAT CHALLENGE AND

01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:44.198
WE'RE WORKING ON THAT BUT WE

01:36:44.265 --> 01:36:45.533
HAVE THREE YEARS BASICALLY TO

01:36:45.599 --> 01:36:46.667
FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO

01:36:46.734 --> 01:36:47.902
WITH THOSE VINEYARDS AND IT'S A

01:36:47.968 --> 01:36:56.043
BIG. ISSUE DISTRICTS. I YOU.

01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:58.112
SELECT THANK VERY MUCH OF A MR

01:36:58.179 --> 01:36:59.480
MILLER- WAS A STRICT TO COME HE

01:36:59.547 --> 01:37:00.781
MADE WITH WITH RESPECT HOUSING

01:37:00.848 --> 01:37:01.916
AND ISSUE THE IMPACT THE WORK

01:37:01.982 --> 01:37:03.217
FOR BUT ASK YOURS TO SEE IF THEY

01:37:03.284 --> 01:37:06.387
CAN SO OF ONE GROWERS- TAKE-

01:37:06.453 --> 01:37:08.088
EFFORTS TO HELP ADVOCATE FOR A

01:37:08.155 --> 01:37:10.090
NUMBER OF THE HOUSING

01:37:10.157 --> 01:37:11.091
LEGISLATION THAT WE HAD IN THE

01:37:11.158 --> 01:37:11.959
LEGISLATURE IN THE PREVIOUS

01:37:12.026 --> 01:37:13.427
YEARS WE HAVE ACTUAL WORK

01:37:13.494 --> 01:37:15.362
CLOSELY WITH- THIS IS YOUR CURRY

01:37:15.429 --> 01:37:18.365
WAS SENATOR DODD- TWO OR THREE

01:37:18.432 --> 01:37:20.100
DIFFERENT HOUSING BILLS PLUS WE

01:37:20.167 --> 01:37:21.835
WORKED WITH THE- CAL OSHA ON

01:37:21.902 --> 01:37:24.038
THEIR PROGRAMS TO DO WITH HOW

01:37:24.104 --> 01:37:25.839
YOU TREAT THE OF THE- THE

01:37:25.906 --> 01:37:27.141
HOUSING SITUATION WHERE IT'S A

01:37:27.208 --> 01:37:28.943
PART OF OUR HOUSING RELATIVE TO

01:37:29.009 --> 01:37:30.144
WORKPLACE SAFETY THOSE KINDS OF

01:37:30.211 --> 01:37:31.545
THINGS SO EVEN. IF THE PUTTING

01:37:31.612 --> 01:37:33.013
ASIAN APPROACH AND THAT AND THAT

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:34.448
AND THAT WILL DISCUSS OF GREAT

01:37:34.515 --> 01:37:36.383
IN THE STORE THEN CONTINUE LEAD

01:37:36.450 --> 01:37:37.618
TO BE ADVOCATING FOR A NUMBER OF

01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:40.120
HOUSING BILLS- TO THE LET ME

01:37:40.187 --> 01:37:41.255
VERY MUCH LIKE THAT YES IT'S

01:37:41.322 --> 01:37:43.657
GREAT AND THEN THE OTHER- POINT

01:37:43.724 --> 01:37:45.893
THAT YOU MADE WAS- WITH FACT TO

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:48.963
A TONS VEHICLES- AND YOU

01:37:49.029 --> 01:37:50.397
REFERENCED A POINT THAT THAT

01:37:50.464 --> 01:37:51.865
MANY OF THE TECHNOLOGIES ARE

01:37:51.932 --> 01:37:53.234
HOME GROWN HERE IN CALIFORNIA

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.902
WHICH IS VERY TRUE TO. HAVE YOU

01:37:54.969 --> 01:37:55.936
BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH THE

01:37:56.003 --> 01:37:56.704
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

01:37:56.770 --> 01:37:59.740
OTHER ENTITIES TO HELP ADVOCATE

01:37:59.807 --> 01:38:00.908
TO BEGIN THE FRAME WORK TO HELP

01:38:00.975 --> 01:38:02.443
SUPPORT SUCH TECHNOLOGIES AS WE

01:38:02.509 --> 01:38:03.644
WERE WORKING MORE WITH THE

01:38:03.711 --> 01:38:05.179
MANUFACTURERS DIRECTLY OKAY BUT

01:38:05.246 --> 01:38:07.281
IT TO ANY WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO

01:38:07.348 --> 01:38:09.283
HAVE ANY OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO

01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:10.150
THE REASON I ASK IS BECAUSE I

01:38:10.217 --> 01:38:11.318
I'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH

01:38:11.385 --> 01:38:13.087
SOME OF THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES

01:38:13.153 --> 01:38:15.022
ALSO IN SILICON VALLEY AND TO

01:38:15.089 --> 01:38:16.957
HEAR YOUR ENGAGEMENT AND SUPPORT

01:38:17.024 --> 01:38:18.959
OF THAT AS WELL I THINK TO HELP

AMPLIFY THE MESSAGE OF THE

01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:20.828
IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING THE

01:38:20.894 --> 01:38:22.696
TECHNOLOGY HERE. OUR BOARD OF

01:38:22.763 --> 01:38:23.931
DIRECTORS MET JUST A FEW WEEKS

01:38:23.998 --> 01:38:25.899
AGO WE DISCUSSES A SHOW LIKE IS

01:38:25.966 --> 01:38:27.735
ONE OF OUR HIGHEST PRIORITIES AT

01:38:27.801 --> 01:38:29.103
TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND WE ARE

01:38:29.169 --> 01:38:37.011
ENGAGED AND. ARE VERY HELPFUL.

01:38:37.077 --> 01:38:38.445
OBESITY IS A THAT YOU HAVE YEAH

ONE'S GOING THAT I GET THAT

01:38:39.513 --> 01:38:40.314
THAT'S NOT. BEEN OF HAVING THIS

01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:41.248
HEARING TO. BECAUSE I DIDN'T I

01:38:41.315 --> 01:38:42.883
IT WAS MADE AWARE THAT THE- THIS

01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:43.484
. HAVE THIS IS A TWO PRIORITY

01:38:43.550 --> 01:38:44.685
WELL TO AN- OF COURSE. A NUMBER

01:38:44.752 --> 01:38:46.320
OF THE- MANY IN THE INDUSTRY.

01:38:46.387 --> 01:38:47.621
ARE LOOKING AT OTHER STATES IN

01:38:47.688 --> 01:38:49.156
WHICH THEY'RE ROLLING OUT THE

01:38:49.223 --> 01:38:50.224
RED CARPET IN SAYING HERE. THE

01:38:50.291 --> 01:38:51.992
RULES RAGS AND DOES NOT BEEN.

01:38:52.059 --> 01:38:53.260
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT

01:38:53.327 --> 01:38:55.129
WE'VE ANTICIPATED BUT- IT

01:38:55.195 --> 01:38:56.864
JUSTICE BGGLES OUR MIND THAT WE

01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:57.931
MIGHT NOT SUPPORT THAT HERE

01:38:57.998 --> 01:38:59.667
GIVEN ITS- HOME GROWN

01:38:59.733 --> 01:39:01.168
TECHNOLOGIES. THAT COULD AGREE

01:39:01.235 --> 01:39:04.104
MORE EFFORT FOR WINE GRAPES AND

01:39:04.171 --> 01:39:05.306
BEING. WE ARE ABLE. IN YOU KNOW

01:39:05.372 --> 01:39:06.974
INDUSTRY WE COMPETE WITH. I

01:39:07.041 --> 01:39:08.375
THINK WE'RE THE FIFTH LARGEST

01:39:08.442 --> 01:39:09.677
CALIFORNIA'S THE FIFTH LARGEST

01:39:09.743 --> 01:39:11.378

DOING IT THE OLD WAY A LOT OF

01:42:29.042 --> 01:42:30.477
THEM ARE TRYING TO LOOK INTO

01:42:30.544 --> 01:42:33.714
THINGS LIKE SYSTEMIC MONITORING-

01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:35.616
TO LOOK AT BASICALLY SOIL

01:42:35.682 --> 01:42:38.118
PROFILES THROUGHOUT THEIR AREA

01:42:38.185 --> 01:42:40.354
HOW MUCH WATER IS IN THE GROUND

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:41.922
IN ONE PLACE VERSUS ANOTHER

01:42:41.989 --> 01:42:43.924
HUMIDITY IN THE AIR THAT CAN

01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:45.025
EVEN. WITH THE MODERN

01:42:45.092 --> 01:42:47.728
TECHNOLOGY. CHECK THE GRAVE

01:42:47.794 --> 01:42:49.830
RIGHT THIS. BUT FOR THE MOST

01:42:49.897 --> 01:42:51.231
PART THEY'RE DRIVING A TRACTOR

01:42:51.298 --> 01:42:52.332
AROUND WITH THE PERSON IN IT

01:42:52.399 --> 01:42:54.668
LOOKING TO CHECK. OR LOOKING FOR

01:42:54.735 --> 01:42:57.771
MILDEW AND ROT WHICH IS A BIG

01:42:57.838 --> 01:43:00.274
ISSUE- YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:02.776
GENERALLY JUST DOING SPRING

01:43:02.843 --> 01:43:06.313
WEATHER THIS MILDURA. AT ALL.

01:43:06.380 --> 01:43:08.315
AND I THINK TECHNOLOGY THAT IS A

01:43:08.382 --> 01:43:10.617
HUGE AREA FOR HELP IN THAT

01:43:10.684 --> 01:43:13.420
REGARD. BUT YOU KNOW ONCE AGAIN

01:43:13.487 --> 01:43:15.255
WE HAVE THOSE BARRIERS ARE HOW

01:43:15.322 --> 01:43:17.724
ARE PEOPLE GOING TO. ACCESS SAID

01:43:17.791 --> 01:43:19.192
HOW THE GOING TO BE TRAINED TO

01:43:19.259 --> 01:43:22.195
USE IT AND- YOU KNOW THE COST

01:43:22.262 --> 01:43:25.566
SO. THIS IS THE COMMON. THANK

01:43:25.632 --> 01:43:28.502
YOU SEE AREA- MISTRAL QUESTION.

01:43:28.569 --> 01:43:30.637
ON YOUR PROFESSIONAL OPINION DO

01:43:30.704 --> 01:43:34.341
YOU SEE TAX ELIMINATING JOBS. NO

01:43:34.408 --> 01:43:35.776
I REALLY DON'T I SEE TECH IS

01:43:35.842 --> 01:43:37.878
ACTUALLY CREATING JOBS FOR A

01:43:37.945 --> 01:43:39.813
NUMBER OF REASONS ONE IS. WHAT

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.882
WHAT DO YOU LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE

01:43:41.949 --> 01:43:43.283
IN A WORKFORCE IT'S AN AGING

01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:45.085
WORKFORCE. AND YOU DON'T HAVE A

01:43:45.152 --> 01:43:46.587
LOT OF NEW YOUNGER PEOPLE COMING

01:43:46.653 --> 01:43:48.121
IN AND IT'S A LOT BECAUSE THEY

01:43:48.188 --> 01:43:49.923
THEY THEY CAN GET. LESS

01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:51.258
PHYSICALLY DEMANDING JOBS AND

01:43:51.325 --> 01:43:53.226
OTHER INDUSTRIES OKAY. AT THE

01:43:53.293 --> 01:43:54.561
SAME TIME THEIF YOU WANT TO

01:43:54.628 --> 01:43:56.763
TRACK THOSE NEW EMPLOYEES INTO

01:43:56.830 --> 01:43:58.732
THIS INDUSTRY AND WORKING IN A

01:43:58.799 --> 01:44:00.767
IN A VINEYARD. GIVE THEM THE

01:44:00.834 --> 01:44:03.236
ABILITY TO ONE IS A TRANSFERABLE

01:44:03.303 --> 01:44:04.705
SKILL WHICH IS YET TECHNOLOGY IF

01:44:04.771 --> 01:44:06.273
YOU'RE IF YOU REMOTE CONTROL

01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:09.076
OPERATING OF MACHINERY YOU'RE OR

01:44:09.142 --> 01:44:11.244
YOU'RE ANALYZING. ENTIRE VENUE

01:44:11.311 --> 01:44:12.713
FOR THE- IRRIGATION ISSUES PAST

01:44:12.779 --> 01:44:14.915
ISSUES OR WHATEVER. YOU'RE

01:44:14.982 --> 01:44:16.149
LEARNING THIS TECHNOLOGY AS A

01:44:16.216 --> 01:44:18.218
TRANSFERABLE SKILL. ON TOP OF

01:44:18.285 --> 01:44:20.153
THAT IF YOU'RE DOING THIS IN

01:44:20.220 --> 01:44:21.488
THAT USINESS THIS UPWARD

01:44:21.555 --> 01:44:23.156
MOBILITY WITHIN IT THAT BEARD

01:44:23.223 --> 01:44:25.826
OPERATION. SO IF ANYTHING I SEE

01:44:25.892 --> 01:44:27.728
TECHNOLOGY AS BEING SOETHING

01:44:27.794 --> 01:44:29.863
THAT WHILE THE TRACK RECORDS TO

01:44:29.930 --> 01:44:32.366
AGRICULTURE BECAUSE IT'S MORE

01:44:32.432 --> 01:44:33.233
OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM. IT'S

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:34.201
HIGHER PAID JOBS FOR THE

01:44:34.267 --> 01:44:38.872
POTENTIALLY. AND IT'S LESS.

01:44:38.939 --> 01:44:39.906
PHYSICALLY DEMANDING WORK. THIS

01:44:39.973 --> 01:44:42.476
YEAR. BAKER IS RUNNING THANK YOU

01:45:28.755 --> 01:45:30.490
OF THIS TIMELESS CONNECTION

01:45:30.557 --> 01:45:31.892
BETWEEN AGRICULTURE AND

01:45:31.958 --> 01:45:34.194

OVER HIS SHOULDER AT AN

01:45:52.846 --> 01:45:54.981
AIRPLANE. THE PHOTO WAS TAKEN ON

01:45:55.048 --> 01:45:57.050
A RANCH IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES

01:45:57.117 --> 01:45:59.152
BACK IN WYOMING. THEN IN THE

01:45:59.219 --> 01:46:01.421
BOOK. THAT PHOTO IS USED TO

01:46:01.488 --> 01:46:04.257
SYMBOLIZE. THAT THE COWBOYS ARE

01:46:04.324 --> 01:46:05.492
KIND OF LOSING THE BATTLE TO

01:46:05.559 --> 01:46:08.462
TECHNOLOGY. BUT THE TRUTH IS

01:46:08.528 --> 01:46:10.964
EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE. MY GREAT

THEY CAN CIRCLE AROUND AND LOOK

01:46:17.237 --> 01:46:19.139
FOR STRIDES I WHEN THEY SEE

01:46:19.206 --> 01:46:20.907
STRAYS THEY TIP THEIR WINGS AND

01:46:20.974 --> 01:46:22.809
YOU KNOW WHERE THE CAMERA YOU

01:46:22.876 --> 01:46:23.443
DON'T HAVE TO WRITE AROUND ALL

01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:25.912
THE TIME. NOWADAYS IF WE MOVE

01:46:25.979 --> 01:46:29.049
FORWARD NOWADAYS THAT'S A DRONE

01:46:29.116 --> 01:46:30.117

01:46:34.421 --> 01:46:36.823
RIGHT BACK TO THE OFFICE. AND SO

01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:38.892
WHEN WE REALLY LOOK AT THIS

01:46:38.959 --> 01:46:40.260
AGRICULTURE'S DEMAND FOR

01:46:40.327 --> 01:46:44.231
TECHNOLOGY IS A CONSISTENT FORCE

01:46:44.297 --> 01:46:45.999
WHERE WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT

01:46:46.066 --> 01:46:49.169
HOW CAN WE REDUCE OUR INPUTS

01:46:49.236 --> 01:46:52.839
INTO AGRICULTURE. ONE OF THOSE

01:46:52.906 --> 01:46:54.641
INPUTS IS EDUCATION AND WE

01:46:54.708 --> 01:46:55.942
STARTED TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION

01:46:56.009 --> 01:46:57.778
HERE TODAY AND HOW DO WE PREPARE

01:46:57.844 --> 01:47:00.013
THIS WORK FORCE THAT CAN DESIGN

01:47:00.080 --> 01:47:02.115
IMPLEMENT AND OPERATE. THAT

01:47:02.182 --> 01:47:05.185
TECHNOLOGY. AND CONTINUE TO

01:47:05.252 --> 01:47:07.254
UPSKILL THE WORK FORCE THAT WE

01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:10.657
HAVE TO KEEP THEM IN OUR WORK

01:47:10.724 --> 01:47:13.627
FORCE AND KEEP THEM. EVOLVING

01:47:13.693 --> 01:47:15.262
WITH THIS RAPIDLY CHANGING

01:47:15.328 --> 01:47:18.098
TECHNOLOGY. AT HARTNELL COLLEGE

01:47:18.165 --> 01:47:20.200
IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO GO

01:47:20.267 --> 01:47:22.135
OUT THERE AND COMMUNICATE NOT

01:47:22.202 --> 01:47:24.070
ONLY WITH THE LARGE EMPLOYERS

01:47:24.137 --> 01:47:25.572
BUT ALSO WITH THE FOLKS THAT ARE

01:47:25.639 --> 01:47:27.374
STARTING AND CREATING THIS

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:29.843
TECHNOLOGY. WE NEED TO

01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:32.212
UNDERSTAND. IN ORDER TO PREPARE

01:47:32.279 --> 01:47:34.848
THE WORKFORCE. SO THAT THEY CAN

01:47:34.915 --> 01:47:36.283
OPERATE THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE

01:47:36.349 --> 01:47:38.718
HAVE ON THE FARM TODAY. BUT SO

01:47:38.785 --> 01:47:40.353
THEY CAN ALSO WE'VE ALL WITH THE

01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:43.323
TECHNOLOGY AS IT CONTINUES TO

01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:46.760
MOVE. A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS

01:47:46.827 --> 01:47:47.794
A CONVERSATION WE'RE HAVING

01:47:47.861 --> 01:47:50.497
RIGHT NOW WITH UC SANTA CRUZ AND

01:47:50.564 --> 01:47:52.065
SO UC SANTA CRUZ CAME OVER TO US

01:47:52.132 --> 01:47:53.767
AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT HEY

01:47:53.834 --> 01:47:55.769
LET'S CREATE. THIS DRONE

01:47:55.836 --> 01:47:57.337
PROGRAM. AND DO WE NEED A

01:47:57.404 --> 01:47:59.139
LICENSING THING AND WE REALLY

01:47:59.206 --> 01:48:03.310
LOOK AT IT A DRONE A SATELLITE-

01:48:03.376 --> 01:48:05.011
A FIXED WING AIRPLANE. IT'S

01:48:05.078 --> 01:48:07.981
REALLY ABOUT GOING OUT THERE AND

01:48:08.048 --> 01:48:09.683
GATHERING A LARGE AMOUNT OF

01:48:09.749 --> 01:48:11.585
INFORMATION AND THEN UTILIZING

01:48:11.651 --> 01:48:13.453
THAT INFORMATION TO MAKE THOSE

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:16.122
QUALITY DECISIONS. SO WHAT WE'RE

01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:17.724
REALLY DOING IS GOING TO ADJUST

01:48:17.791 --> 01:48:18.925
THAT AND TRY TO RUN THAT

01:48:18.992 --> 01:48:20.927
TECHNOLOGY ACROSS MULTIPLE

01:48:20.994 --> 01:48:22.195
PROGRAMS SO IT'S NOT THAT

01:48:22.262 --> 01:48:24.364
TARGETED THING OF JUST A DRONE

01:48:24.431 --> 01:48:26.766
BUT HOW CAN WE USE THAT. SO MY

01:48:26.833 --> 01:48:29.236
FOCUS AT HARTNELL IS HOW DO WE

01:48:29.302 --> 01:48:31.605
DEVELOP THESE HIGHLY

01:48:31.671 --> 01:48:35.342
SOPHISTICATED WORK FORCE. MANY

01:48:35.408 --> 01:48:37.110
OF OUR DEGREE DEGREE SEEKING

01:48:37.177 --> 01:48:39.746
STUDENTS ARE FIRST GENERATION.

01:48:39.813 --> 01:48:41.982
LATINA X. FAMILIES THAT COME

01:48:42.048 --> 01:48:43.617
FROM YOU KNOW THE FARM WORKING

01:48:43.683 --> 01:48:47.287
WORLD. SOMETIMES THEY ARE GOING

01:48:47.354 --> 01:48:48.889
TO SHY AWAY FROM AGRICULTURE

01:48:48.955 --> 01:48:50.190
BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY LOOKING

01:48:50.257 --> 01:48:51.725
AT GOING INTO AN ENTIRELY

01:48:51.791 --> 01:48:53.827
DIFFERENT DIRECTION. SO PART OF

01:48:53.894 --> 01:48:56.029
OUR CHALLENGE IS HELPING THEM

01:48:56.096 --> 01:48:58.331
SEE THIS INCREDIBLE CAREER

01:48:58.398 --> 01:49:00.934
OPPORTUNITY THAT AWAITS THEM IN

01:49:01.001 --> 01:49:04.104
AGTECH. AND THESE CAREERS ARE

01:49:04.170 --> 01:49:05.639
RIGHT THERE IN THEIR BACKYARD.

01:49:05.705 --> 01:49:07.574
NOW AND MOVING FORWARD INTO THE

01:49:07.641 --> 01:49:10.176
FUTURE. LEARNING HOW TO

01:49:10.243 --> 01:49:11.878
IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGIES THAT

01:49:11.945 --> 01:49:15.115
INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND YIELD

01:49:15.181 --> 01:49:17.183
WHILE DECREASING IMPORTS AT THE

01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:19.920
SAME TIME MAKING AG JOBS MORE

01:49:19.986 --> 01:49:22.022
HIGHLY SKILLED AND MORE

01:49:22.088 --> 01:49:22.489
ATTRACTIVE TO THE NEXT

01:49:22.555 --> 01:49:26.126
GENERATION. FOR EXAMPLE A SELF

01:49:26.192 --> 01:49:26.960
GUIDED TRACTOR WITH A VARIABLE

01:49:27.027 --> 01:49:29.496
RATE APPLICATION CAN TRACK THE

01:49:29.562 --> 01:49:33.266
INPUT APP THE INPUTS. THAT CAN

01:49:33.333 --> 01:49:35.268
BE USED TO DETERMINE THE MOST

01:49:35.335 --> 01:49:38.171
EFFICIENT WAY TO APPLY THOSE

01:49:38.238 --> 01:49:38.672
DIFFERENT INPUTS SUCH AS

01:49:38.738 --> 01:49:42.909
FERTILIZERS. WE THEN. CAN TAKE

01:49:42.976 --> 01:49:44.110
AND KEEP A LOG OF THOSE

01:49:44.177 --> 01:49:45.812
APPLICATIONS AND SO WE TRULY

01:49:45.879 --> 01:49:48.248
KNOW EXACTLY THAT SITE SPECIFIC

01:49:48.315 --> 01:49:51.217
CONCEPT OF WHERE AND HOW MUCH

01:49:51.284 --> 01:49:53.787
FERTILIZER WAS USED ON THAT FORM

01:49:53.853 --> 01:49:55.088
AND THEN WE CAN DO ABOUT JUST

01:49:55.155 --> 01:49:57.157
LIKE WE BALANCE OUR CHECKBOOKS

01:49:57.223 --> 01:49:58.358
WE CAN DO THAT NUTRIENT BALANCE

01:49:58.425 --> 01:50:02.562
RIGHT OUT THERE. THESE AND THERE

01:50:02.629 --> 01:50:04.564
THERE'S AN ENTIRE SEGMENT OF

01:50:04.631 --> 01:50:06.299
PLANT GENETICS FOR EXAMPLE

01:50:06.366 --> 01:50:08.969
DEVELOPING PLANS THEY CAN STAND

01:50:09.035 --> 01:50:11.371
UP COLLAR SO THAT THESE HARVEST

01:50:11.438 --> 01:50:13.006
THESE AUTOMATED HARVEST MACHINES

01:50:13.073 --> 01:50:14.841
CAN GO OUT THERE AND HARVEST. OR

01:50:14.908 --> 01:50:16.443
WORKING WITH PLANTS THAT ARE

01:50:16.509 --> 01:50:19.980
TRULY DESIGNED TO BE GROWN IN

01:50:20.046 --> 01:50:21.815
CLIMATE CONTROLLED GREENHOUSES.

01:50:21.881 --> 01:50:28.088
DRISKELL BERRIES S A LARGE-

01:50:28.154 --> 01:50:31.858
ALYSS GROWTH AND THERE FARMING

01:50:31.925 --> 01:50:33.059
TECHNICIANS ARE WORKING

01:50:33.126 --> 01:50:35.662
ALONGSIDE THE GENETICS TEAM TO

01:50:35.729 --> 01:50:37.097
REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT THOSE

01:50:37.163 --> 01:50:39.032
QUALITIES BEST SUIT FOR THOSE

01:50:39.099 --> 01:50:40.800
PLANTS TO BE GROWN IN THAT IN

01:50:40.867 --> 01:50:42.969
THAT TYPE OF LOCATION.

01:50:43.036 --> 01:50:44.237
INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT

01:50:44.304 --> 01:50:45.772
REQUIRES TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF

01:50:45.839 --> 01:50:47.841
TECHNOLOGY TO IDENTIFY THE

01:50:47.907 --> 01:50:50.010
INFESTATION AND THEN PROVIDE

01:50:50.076 --> 01:50:51.911
JUST IN TIME AROUND AT. THE

01:50:51.978 --> 01:50:54.314
RATIFICATION WITH THE LEAST

01:50:54.381 --> 01:50:57.050
IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT. MOST

01:50:57.117 --> 01:50:58.418
OF ARE STILL MOST OF OUR

01:50:58.485 --> 01:51:02.956
STUDENTS- ARE REALLY LOOKING AT

01:51:03.023 --> 01:51:05.191
AGRICULTURE CAREERS THAT FIFTEEN

01:51:05.258 --> 01:51:07.227
YEARS AGO WE WOULDN'T EVEN I

01:51:07.293 --> 01:51:09.896
IDENTIFY AS AGRICULTURE. THEY

01:51:09.963 --> 01:51:12.065
WILL JOIN THE WORK FORCE IN WITH

01:51:12.132 --> 01:51:13.900
IN WHICH MATHEMATICIANS

01:51:13.967 --> 01:51:15.935
ENGINEERS BIOLOGISTS SALES

01:51:16.002 --> 01:51:18.171
PRODUCTION CREWS WORK TOGETHER

01:51:18.238 --> 01:51:21.241
TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. WE ALREADY

01:51:21.307 --> 01:51:23.276
HAVE SEEN THIS THROUGH THE OUR

01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:24.878
EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNSHIP

01:51:24.944 --> 01:51:26.780
PROGRAM AT HARTNELL WHERE WE

01:51:26.846 --> 01:51:28.148
TAKE OUR MATH STUDENTS AND

01:51:28.214 --> 01:51:29.182
THEY'RE WORKING ON YIELD

01:51:29.249 --> 01:51:31.284
FORECASTING FOR SPECIFIC

01:51:31.351 --> 01:51:33.386
SOFTWARE WE'RE HAVING OUR

01:51:33.453 --> 01:51:35.255
BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY STUDENTS

01:51:35.321 --> 01:51:37.824
WORKING ON AN E. COLI GENETICS

01:51:37.891 --> 01:51:39.426
PRODUCTS SO AGAIN GETTING THEM

01:51:39.492 --> 01:51:41.494
IN THERE AND TRULY SEEING WHAT

01:51:41.561 --> 01:51:47.100
THE SCIENCE. IS OUT THERE DOING. IN THE KEY WITH THE

01:51:47.167 --> 01:51:48.968
INTERNSHIPS IS BECAUSE AS WE

01:51:49.035 --> 01:51:50.670
TALKED ABOUT EARLIER WITH THREE

01:51:50.737 --> 01:51:51.204
TO FOUR HUNDRED DIFFERENT

01:51:51.271 --> 01:51:53.740
COMMODITIES WITH. TWO HUNDRED

01:51:53.807 --> 01:51:54.574
DIFFERENT JOB TITLES PER

01:51:54.641 --> 01:51:56.009
COMMODITY. THAT COULD BE A

01:51:56.076 --> 01:51:57.544
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF COLLEGE

01:51:57.610 --> 01:52:00.413
CLASSES SO THESE INTERNSHIPS ARE

01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:03.016
REALLY THIS GREAT WAY TO REDUCE

01:52:03.083 --> 01:52:05.051
THAT CREATION OF A MYRIAD OF

01:52:05.118 --> 01:52:07.887
COLLEGE COURSES. STUDENTS GAIN

01:52:07.954 --> 01:52:09.456
REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE IN THE

01:52:09.522 --> 01:52:12.192
INDUSTRY IS PROVIDED A WELL

01:52:12.258 --> 01:52:14.260
TRAINED QUALIFIED WORKFORCE.

01:52:14.327 --> 01:52:15.795
THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS WERE

01:52:15.862 --> 01:52:17.430
REALLY FOCUSED ON TO TRY TO

01:52:17.497 --> 01:52:19.966
REDUCE THE BRAIN DRAIN FROM THE

01:52:20.033 --> 01:52:23.203
SALINAS VALLEY. MANY OF OUR

01:52:23.269 --> 01:52:24.737
STUDENTS TO CHOOSE STEM FIELDS

01:52:24.804 --> 01:52:26.339
DO THAT PER PACK PRECISELY

01:52:26.406 --> 01:52:28.108
BECAUSE THEY'RE LOOKING AT THESE

01:52:28.174 --> 01:52:31.077
OTHER AREAS. INTERNSHIPS ARE THE

01:52:31.144 --> 01:52:33.646
APPLIED LEARNING EXPERIENCES

01:52:33.713 --> 01:52:34.948
THAT THOSE STUDENTS THAT ARE

01:52:35.014 --> 01:52:36.182
INTERESTED IN ENGINEERING

01:52:36.249 --> 01:52:38.751
BIOTECH COMPUTER SCIENCE CAN

01:52:38.818 --> 01:52:39.819
DISCOVER THAT CALIFORNIA

01:52:39.886 --> 01:52:41.187
AGRICULTURE ISN'T WHAT THEY

01:52:41.254 --> 01:52:46.059
IMAGINE. THEY GET TO USE THEIR

01:52:46.126 --> 01:52:47.961
THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE IN THESE

01:52:48.027 --> 01:52:52.132
HIGH. TECH AREAS- AND TO GET TO

01:52:52.198 --> 01:52:54.234
WORK IN THEIR BACKYARD. THE

01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:56.402
INTERNSHIPS ARE PAID SO THAT THE

01:52:56.469 --> 01:52:59.072
STUDENTS CAN SCHEME CAN GAIN THE

01:52:59.139 --> 01:53:01.541
RELATIVE SKILLS. BUT THEY ALSO

01:53:01.608 --> 01:53:03.409
NEED TO THAT WAGE TO SUPPORT

01:53:03.476 --> 01:53:06.546
THEIR FAMILIES. ANOTHER

01:53:06.613 --> 01:53:07.847
IMPORTANT GROUP AND I LOVE IT

01:53:07.914 --> 01:53:09.082
THAT THIS GROUP IS ALREADY

01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:10.917
TOUCHING ON THIS. IS A STE THE

01:53:10.984 --> 01:53:12.785
PEOPLE THERE ALREADY WORKING IN

01:53:12.852 --> 01:53:15.054
OUR AG INDUSTRY. I TEND TO CALL

01:53:15.121 --> 01:53:16.289
THOSE STUDENTS AND GRANTS IN

01:53:16.356 --> 01:53:17.957
THAT WORLD. THE INCUMBENT

01:53:18.024 --> 01:53:21.094
WORKERS. WE HAVE JOINED WITH

01:53:21.161 --> 01:53:22.962
EMPLOYERS TO OFFER NON CREDIT

01:53:23.029 --> 01:53:24.998
COURSES THAT PREPARE THAT

01:53:25.064 --> 01:53:27.000
WORKFORCE FOR THESE NEW ROLES

01:53:27.066 --> 01:53:31.104
AND THEIR COMPANIES ARE ABLE TO.

01:53:31.171 --> 01:53:33.239
START TO EXPAND THEIR TECHNOLOGY

01:53:33.306 --> 01:53:35.542
AND THEIR AUTOMATION AS THEIR

01:53:35.608 --> 01:53:37.810
WORK FORCE GAINES THESE NEW

01:53:37.877 --> 01:53:40.313
THESE NEW THIS NEW TRAINING.

01:53:40.380 --> 01:53:41.981
THEY CAN TAKE THE COURSES IN THE

01:53:42.048 --> 01:53:43.383
EVENINGS AND GAIN NEW SKILLS

01:53:43.449 --> 01:53:45.185
THAT QUALIFY THEM FOR THESE NEW

01:53:45.251 --> 01:53:48.087
OPPORTUNITIES. WE ARE ABLE TO

01:53:48.154 --> 01:53:49.088
LEARN NEW THINGS SUCH AS

01:53:49.155 --> 01:53:50.657
MECHATRONICS AND SO RIGHT NOW

01:53:50.723 --> 01:53:52.492
OUR COLLEGES IS STARTING A BRAND

01:53:52.559 --> 01:53:54.127
NEW MECHATRONICS PROGRAM IN

01:53:54.194 --> 01:53:56.496
JANUARY. AND WE'VE INSTALLED A

01:53:56.563 --> 01:53:57.830
TWO MILLION DOLLAR SMART

01:53:57.897 --> 01:54:01.067
FACTORY. WHERE STUDENTS CAN

01:54:01.134 --> 01:54:03.203
FOCUS ON INTEGRATED LOGISTICS

01:54:03.269 --> 01:54:04.837
COMMUNICATION MECHATRONICS

01:54:04.904 --> 01:54:07.040
ROBOTIC ASSEMBLY AND

01:54:07.106 --> 01:54:09.676
TROUBLESHOOTING CAPACITIES. NOT

01:54:09.742 --> 01:54:12.045
ONLY WAS THIS TECHNOLOGY FUNDED

01:54:12.111 --> 01:54:15.215
BY A PRODUCE LEADER TAYLOR FARMS

01:54:15.281 --> 01:54:17.183
THAT'S HEAD QUARTERED IN SALINAS

01:54:17.250 --> 01:54:19.986
BUT WE ALSO TOURED A LOT OF

01:54:20.053 --> 01:54:21.120
ADVANCED FOOD MANUFACTURING

01:54:21.187 --> 01:54:23.523
FACILITIES MET WITH EMPLOYERS

01:54:23.590 --> 01:54:25.692
AND REALLY FOCUSED ON WHAT IS

01:54:25.758 --> 01:54:28.194
THE ENDGAME TO CREATE WHERE WE

01:54:28.261 --> 01:54:31.764
WANTED TO GO. WE SPECIFICALLY

01:54:31.831 --> 01:54:34.167
DESIGNED OUR TRAINING LAB IN OUR

01:54:34.234 --> 01:54:36.936
CURRICULUM TO ADDRESS BOTH

01:54:37.003 --> 01:54:39.105
OUTSIDE IN THE FIELD BUT ALSO IN

01:54:39.172 --> 01:54:42.141
THE PROCESSING OF THAT FOOD. SO

01:54:42.208 --> 01:54:44.077
STUDENTS CAN UNDERSTAND THE AGRA

01:54:44.143 --> 01:54:47.447
NAMIK MANAGEMENT OF THE SOIL AND

01:54:47.513 --> 01:54:49.048
THE WEATHER BUT ALSO THE

01:54:49.115 --> 01:54:50.383
INTEGRATION OF THIS NEW

01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:52.185
TECHNOLOGY AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

01:54:52.252 --> 01:54:53.686
WE WANT TO GIVE OUR STUDENTS

01:54:53.753 --> 01:54:56.322
THAT HANDS ON SKILLS SO THEY CAN

01:54:56.389 --> 01:54:58.057
HIT THE GROUND RUNNING. THE

01:54:58.124 --> 01:55:00.059
SIMPLE FACT IS MANY OF OUR

01:55:00.126 --> 01:55:01.728
STUDENTS ONCE THEY GET OUT FROM

01:55:01.794 --> 01:55:03.229
OUR COLLEGE PROGRAMS ARE

01:55:03.296 --> 01:55:06.132
EXPECTED TO. COME IN AND REALLY

01:55:06.199 --> 01:55:08.234
TURN A PROFIT WITHIN THE FIRST

01:55:08.301 --> 01:55:11.170
TWO WEEKS SO GIVING THOSE TRUE

01:55:11.237 --> 01:55:12.972
HANDS ON SKILLS ARE SO IMPORTANT

01:55:13.039 --> 01:55:14.374
. WE ALSO WANT TO GIVE OUR

01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:15.775
STUDENTS GREAT UNDERSTANDINGS OF

01:55:15.842 --> 01:55:18.077
FLUID DYNAMICS ELECTRICITY AND

01:55:18.144 --> 01:55:19.379
OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THAT CAN

01:55:19.445 --> 01:55:21.314
HELP THEM SO THAT AS SYSTEMS

01:55:21.381 --> 01:55:23.149
INVOLVED OVER THE NEXT FIVE TO

01:55:23.216 --> 01:55:24.751
SEVEN YEARS. THEY'RE READY TO

01:55:24.817 --> 01:55:26.986
MEET THOSE CHALLENGES. WE ALSO

01:55:27.053 --> 01:55:29.289
RECOGNIZE THAT NOT. THAT WE ALSO

01:55:29.355 --> 01:55:31.758
RECOGNIZE. THAT NOT JUST OUR AG

01:55:31.824 --> 01:55:33.192
TECH STUDENTS BUT STUDENTS

01:55:33.259 --> 01:55:35.361
HOLISTICALLY NOW ARE REALLY

01:55:35.428 --> 01:55:38.298
LIFETIME LEARNERS. NGUYEN THEY

01:55:38.364 --> 01:55:39.999
MAY HAVE TAKEN THE SOILS CLASS

01:55:40.066 --> 01:55:41.234
OR PLANT SCIENCE CLASS IN THE

01:55:41.301 --> 01:55:45.071
PAST. BUT OVER THE LAST THREE

01:55:45.138 --> 01:55:46.773
FIVE SEVEN YEARS SO MANY THINGS

01:55:46.839 --> 01:55:48.541
HAVE CHANGED SO WE SEE A LOT OF

01:55:48.608 --> 01:55:50.276
THE STUDENTS COMING BACK IN

01:55:50.343 --> 01:55:52.245
NEEDING TO RETAKE THOSE CLASSES.

01:55:52.312 --> 01:55:53.146
TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY CAN

01:55:53.212 --> 01:55:55.081
INTEGRATE THE TECHNOLOGY WITH

01:55:55.148 --> 01:55:55.648
THE THEORY THAT THEY'VE USED

01:55:55.715 --> 01:55:57.216
BEFORE AND THIS IS WHERE

01:55:57.283 --> 01:55:58.618
COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS SUCH A

01:55:58.685 --> 01:56:00.420
GREAT ADVANTAGE BECAUSE WE'RE

01:56:00.486 --> 01:56:02.322
RIGHT THERE IN THEIR BACKYARDS-

01:56:02.388 --> 01:56:04.557
BUT WE DO NEED TO RE EXAMINE

01:56:04.624 --> 01:56:06.092
SOME OF THE RESTRICTIONS THE

01:56:06.159 --> 01:56:08.394
COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE. BECAUSE

01:56:08.461 --> 01:56:10.930
MANY MANY OF OUR CLASSES ARE YOU

01:56:10.997 --> 01:56:16.769
TAKE A ONCE AND THEN YOU'RE DONE. BUT REALLY THIS IS ALREADY

01:56:16.836 --> 01:56:17.937
STARTING TO HAPPEN AND MOST OF

01:56:18.004 --> 01:56:19.305
OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN SAY

01:56:19.372 --> 01:56:22.241
SIMILAR STORIES. AT HARTNELL WE

01:56:22.308 --> 01:56:24.410
HAVE A FOOD SAFETY PROGRAM FOR

01:56:24.477 --> 01:56:26.446
ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR STUDENTS.

01:56:26.512 --> 01:56:28.281
HAVE A BACHELORS DEGREE IN

01:56:28.348 --> 01:56:30.416
SOMETHING LIKE AG BUSINESS OR

01:56:30.483 --> 01:56:32.785
MICROBIOLOGY BUT BECAUSE OF A

01:56:32.852 --> 01:56:34.721
CAREER CHANGER PIVOT THEY'RE

01:56:34.787 --> 01:56:35.955
COMING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY

01:56:36.022 --> 01:56:37.957
COLLEGE TO UNDERSTAND. HOW DO I

01:56:38.024 --> 01:56:40.093
DO THAT PAPERWORK WHAT AM I

01:56:40.159 --> 01:56:41.928
GONNA EXPECT WHEN THE AUDITOR

01:56:41.994 --> 01:56:47.433
COMES ON TO OUR ONTO OUR FARM.

01:56:47.500 --> 01:56:49.035
AND THAT IS WHERE HARTNELL AND

01:56:49.102 --> 01:56:51.003
OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES CAN CAN

01:56:51.070 --> 01:56:53.172
REALLY HELP BECAUSE WE CAN COME

01:56:53.239 --> 01:56:54.874
IN AND TEACH THOSE HARD SKILLS.

01:56:54.941 --> 01:56:56.476
SO WHEN WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT

01:56:56.542 --> 01:56:58.077
OUR STUDENTS IT'S REALLY A

01:56:58.144 --> 01:57:00.279
BIFURCATED APPROACH AND ONE IN

01:57:00.346 --> 01:57:01.948
WHICH WE WANT TO EMBRACE OUR

01:57:02.014 --> 01:57:04.984
TRADITIONAL STUDENTS THOSE HIGH

01:57:05.051 --> 01:57:05.518
SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT JUST

01:57:05.585 --> 01:57:07.120
GRADUATED. BUT WE ALSO REALLY

01:57:07.186 --> 01:57:09.455
NEED TO EMBRACE AND ATTRACT THE

01:57:09.522 --> 01:57:11.724
ADULT STUDENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:57:11.791 --> 01:57:12.291
OUT THERE WORKING FOR TEN OR

01:57:12.358 --> 01:57:14.761
FIFTEEN YEARS. THE EIGHTEEN AND

01:57:14.827 --> 01:57:16.195
NINETEEN YEAR OLDS THEY NEED TO

01:57:16.262 --> 01:57:18.030
SEE HOW THEY FIT INTO THIS

01:57:18.097 --> 01:57:19.966
CONTINUE ON THE BACK PRODUCTION

01:57:20.032 --> 01:57:21.701
. THE EXPERIENCE WORKERS ALREADY

01:57:21.768 --> 01:57:23.970
UNDERSTAND THAT PART BUT THEY

01:57:24.036 --> 01:57:25.972
NEED HOSE ADDITIONAL HARD TO

01:57:26.038 --> 01:57:27.140
FIND SKILLS THAT WILL QUALIFY

01:57:27.206 --> 01:57:29.308
THEM FOR THE HIGHER PAYING ROLES

01:57:29.375 --> 01:57:31.411
AS A TECHNICIAN. OR HOW THEY CAN

01:57:31.477 --> 01:57:33.646
INCORPORATE THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY

01:57:33.713 --> 01:57:35.782
INTO THEIR CURRENT JOB. AT A

01:57:35.848 --> 01:57:37.583
COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL WE'RE

01:57:37.650 --> 01:57:39.118
EXCITED. TO MEET THESE

01:57:39.185 --> 01:57:40.953
CHALLENGES AND WE RECOGNIZE THE

01:57:41.020 --> 01:57:43.122
CENTRAL ROLE IN MEETING THIS

01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:45.358
WORKFORCE NEED FOR THE AG

01:57:45.425 --> 01:57:47.226
INDUSTRY. FIRST WE MUST WORK

01:57:47.293 --> 01:57:48.928
EVEN HARDER TO HELP OUR STUDENTS

01:57:48.995 --> 01:57:50.863
SEE THEMSELVES IN THIS HIGH TECH

01:57:50.930 --> 01:57:53.132
TECHNOLOGY. AND STEPPING INTO

01:57:53.199 --> 01:57:55.802
THESE INTO THIS FUTURE.

01:57:55.868 --> 01:57:57.870
ACHIEVING THIS ON A LARGE SCALE

01:57:57.937 --> 01:57:59.806
MAY REQUIRE A STATE WIDE

01:57:59.872 --> 01:58:01.908
AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. NOT UNLIKE

01:58:01.974 --> 01:58:03.876
WHAT MUST MANY OF THE RUST BELT

01:58:03.943 --> 01:58:05.244
STATES DID FOR ADVANCED

01:58:05.311 --> 01:58:08.981
MANUFACTURING. SECONDLY WE ARE

01:58:09.048 --> 01:58:11.017
INCREASINGLY HELPING EMPLOYERS

01:58:11.083 --> 01:58:12.752
SHIFT THEIR CURRENT EMPLOYEES

01:58:12.819 --> 01:58:14.921
INTO AUTOMATED HARVESTING AND

01:58:14.987 --> 01:58:17.323
PROCESSING AND THEN TRAINING

01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:18.825
THEM ALL THESE DATA DRIVEN TO

01:58:18.891 --> 01:58:21.461
DATA. DRIVEN DECISIONS AND JUST

01:58:21.527 --> 01:58:24.163
IN TIME MANAGEMENT. AND FINALLY%

01:58:24.230 --> 01:58:25.965
WE ARE ALSO GRAPPLING WITH THE

01:58:26.032 --> 01:58:28.835
OTHER REALITY THAT I MENTIONED.

01:58:28.901 --> 01:58:31.471
AG EDUCATION CAN NO LONGER BE A

01:58:31.537 --> 01:58:34.073
ONE AND DONE THING. TECHNOLOGY

01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:36.943
THAT COMPANIES RELY ON TODAY CAN

01:58:37.009 --> 01:58:38.845
QUICKLY BECOME OUTDATED SO WE

01:58:38.911 --> 01:58:40.379
HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN

01:58:40.446 --> 01:58:42.715
PROVIDE CAREER LONG TRAINING TO

01:58:42.782 --> 01:58:45.518
HELP WORKERS REMAIN RELEVANT.

01:58:45.585 --> 01:58:47.286
OUR TEACHING TECHNOLOGIES THAT

01:58:47.353 --> 01:58:49.922
WE HAVE ALSO HAVE TO KEEP UP

01:58:49.989 --> 01:58:52.925
WITH THIS CONTINUAL IMPROVING

01:58:52.992 --> 01:58:54.861
AND CYCLE THAT THAT

01:58:54.927 --> 01:58:57.263
AGRICULTURE'S MOVING THROUGH. WE

01:58:57.330 --> 01:58:59.065
KNOW THERE'S NO SUBSTITUTE FOR

01:58:59.131 --> 01:59:00.800
HANDS ON LEARNING AND CAREER

01:59:00.867 --> 01:59:05.137
DEVELOPMENT- BUT THAT OFTEN CAN

01:59:05.204 --> 01:59:07.306
OCCUR IN THOSE INTERNSHIPS THAT

01:59:07.373 --> 01:59:10.109
I'VE DISCUSSED. HOWEVER SCALING

01:59:10.176 --> 01:59:12.612
UP THERE THE AVAILABILITY FOR

01:59:12.678 --> 01:59:14.413
PAID INTERNSHIPS WILL REQUIRE

01:59:14.480 --> 01:59:16.182
FUNDING AT HARTNELL COLLEGE WERE

01:59:16.249 --> 01:59:18.117
EAGER TO SEE MORE AND MORE OF

01:59:18.184 --> 01:59:21.754
OUR STUDENTS. PURSUING REWARDING

01:59:21.821 --> 01:59:23.122
CAREERS IN AG TECH AND THEY'RE

01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:25.157
CLOSE TO HOME IN ADDITION WE

01:59:25.224 --> 01:59:26.826
WILL CONTINUE TO COLLABORATE

01:59:26.893 --> 01:59:28.628
WITH EMPLOYERS EAGER TO SHARPEN

01:59:28.694 --> 01:59:31.130
THEIR EXISTING WORKERS ABILITIES

01:59:31.197 --> 01:59:33.099
TO THRIVE IN THIS RAPIDLY

01:59:33.165 --> 01:59:34.300
CHANGING INDUSTRY. DOING THESE

01:59:34.367 --> 01:59:36.335
THINGS WELL AND MAKING THEM ON A

01:59:36.402 --> 01:59:38.304
LARGE SCALE ACROSS CALIFORNIA

01:59:38.371 --> 01:59:40.907
WILL REQUIRE INVESTMENT. THE L.

01:59:40.973 --> 01:59:45.645
SO. WHAT I'M HERE TO SAY IS A

01:59:45.711 --> 01:59:47.179
I'M HERE ASKING THE SAME THING

01:59:47.246 --> 01:59:48.514
THAT MY GREAT GRANDFATHER DID

01:59:48.581 --> 01:59:50.516
FROM THAT AIRPLANE PILOT AND IF

01:59:50.583 --> 01:59:51.717
YOU GUYS CAN REALLY LOOK AT THIS

01:59:51.784 --> 01:59:54.420
AND HELP US OUT IDENTIFY SOME OF

01:59:54.487 --> 02:00:01.928
THOSE LOST FUNDS THANK YOU. FOR

02:00:01.994 --> 02:00:05.364
ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS- THANK YOU

02:00:05.431 --> 02:00:06.966
VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION

02:00:07.033 --> 02:00:08.868
I'M A BIG COMMUNITY COLLEGE

ADVOCATE THEM HIGH SCHOOL-

02:00:11.804 --> 02:00:15.107
AGRICULTURAL CLASS BECAUSE I'M

02:00:15.174 --> 02:00:18.077
SO I ADMIRE WHAT YOU'RE DOING IT

02:00:18.144 --> 02:00:21.247
HARD NOW- KILL OTHER COMMUNITY

02:00:21.314 --> 02:00:25.184
COLLEGES TAP INTO YOUR CLASSES-

02:00:25.251 --> 02:00:29.422
FOR THE CLASSES ONLINE- IN OTHER

02:00:29.488 --> 02:00:31.123
COLLEGES COLLABORATING BECAUSE

02:00:31.190 --> 02:00:33.359
THIS THIS IS NOT A ONE THIS IS

02:00:33.426 --> 02:00:34.660
ALMOST NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL

02:00:34.727 --> 02:00:36.963
BUT- A LOT OF THE AG TECHNOLOGY

02:00:37.029 --> 02:00:40.099
IS KIND OF ONE SIZE- SO CAN YOU

02:00:40.166 --> 02:00:41.734
GIVE ME SOME IDEAS WHAT YOU

02:00:41.801 --> 02:00:43.202
MIGHT BE DOING WITH OTHER

02:00:43.269 --> 02:00:45.438
COLLEGES IN MY RURAL. COLLEGES I

02:00:45.504 --> 02:00:46.439
DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE DOING

02:00:46.505 --> 02:00:48.074
THIS AND SO SHAME ON ME I WILL

02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:50.443
FIND OUT BUT- DIFFERENCE THERE

02:00:50.509 --> 02:00:52.078
THERE'S COLLABORATION VAULT AND

02:00:52.144 --> 02:00:53.646

TOGETHER BE ABLE TO DO AYE I

02:00:55.247 --> 02:00:55.948
KNOW SOME OF THESE CLASSES COULD

02:00:56.015 --> 02:00:57.016
BE ONLINE THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE

02:00:57.083 --> 02:00:59.385
ON THE FIELD SO. ARE YOU WILING

02:00:59.452 --> 02:01:03.189
TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION IT

YES- SO. CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY

02:01:04.890 --> 02:01:06.926
COLLEGES A PRETTY SMALL NETWORK-

02:01:06.993 --> 02:01:09.261
AND SO WE WORK. REALLY CLOSELY

02:01:09.328 --> 02:01:09.996
TOGETHER SO DENNIS WAS

02:01:10.062 --> 02:01:11.797
DISCUSSING. KIND OF THAT

02:01:11.864 --> 02:01:13.366
COLLABORATIVE OF REALLY KIND OF

02:01:13.432 --> 02:01:15.534
LOOKING AT NORTH SOUTH THE

02:01:15.601 --> 02:01:17.436
CENTRAL VALLEY AND SALINAS. HAS

02:01:17.503 --> 02:01:19.171
KIND OF THAT APPROACH IN THOSE

02:01:19.238 --> 02:01:19.672
THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED

02:01:19.739 --> 02:01:22.074
MULTIPLE TIMES- A LOT OF US GET

02:01:22.141 --> 02:01:23.342
TOGETHER WORK ON THAT WE WORK

02:01:23.409 --> 02:01:25.211
ON. ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW ONE OF

02:01:25.277 --> 02:01:27.346
THE DOWNSIDES WHEN THE HARD.

02:01:27.413 --> 02:01:31.550
REALITIES OF. IT UP WITH GRANTS

02:01:31.617 --> 02:01:33.052
. IS NUMBERS AND WHEN YOU'RE

02:01:33.119 --> 02:01:34.920
RURAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE. YOU

02:01:34.987 --> 02:01:36.722
JUST CAN'T HIT THE NUMBERS THAT

02:01:36.789 --> 02:01:38.391
A LOT OF URBAN COLLEGES CAN HIT

02:01:38.457 --> 02:01:39.425
WHEN YOU'RE APPLYING FOR A

02:01:39.492 --> 02:01:41.794
GRANT. SO THE ONLY WAY WE CAN

02:01:41.861 --> 02:01:44.430
REALLY BE COMPETITIVE. IS BY

02:01:44.497 --> 02:01:46.032
WORKING TOGETHER ACROSS TO. YOU

OF DIFFERENT THINGS AND SO LIKE-

02:02:03.215 --> 02:02:04.850
I JUST FINISHED WITH A- NATIONAL

02:02:04.917 --> 02:02:07.253
SCIENCE FOUNDATION- GRANT WHERE

02:02:07.319 --> 02:02:08.954
WE TOOK. ALL OF OUR FOOD SAFETY

02:02:09.021 --> 02:02:11.824
CLASSES. AND STE- PUT THOSE IN A

02:02:11.891 --> 02:02:13.225
CANVAS CARTRIDGE SO YES THEY'RE

02:02:13.292 --> 02:02:15.261
ONLINE. AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES

02:02:15.327 --> 02:02:16.295
ARE USING A SOFTWARE CALLED

02:02:16.362 --> 02:02:18.297
CAMPUS. AND SO THEY- THEY CAN

02:02:18.364 --> 02:02:19.231
ACTUALLY JUST DOWNLOAD IT AND

02:02:19.298 --> 02:02:20.833
UPLOAD RIGHT INTO THEIR THEIR

02:02:20.900 --> 02:02:22.601
THEIR CLASSES. SO THE ONLY TO

02:02:22.668 --> 02:02:23.569
RUN THAT THROUGH THEIR ACADEMIC

02:02:23.636 --> 02:02:24.970
SENATES IN THOSE KIND OF THINGS.

02:02:25.037 --> 02:02:26.172
WE ALSO TAKE THAT SAME

02:02:26.238 --> 02:02:28.074
INFORMATION AND NOW THAT CAN BE

02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:29.275
INTEGRATED RIGHT INTO THOSE HIGH

02:02:29.341 --> 02:02:30.843
SCHOOL CURRICULA. BUT A LOT OF

02:02:30.910 --> 02:02:33.079
THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING AND

02:02:33.145 --> 02:02:33.713
WE KIND OF TOUCHED ON IT EARLIER

02:02:33.779 --> 02:02:36.048
YES. WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THAT

02:02:36.115 --> 02:02:38.918
STUDENT. GRADUATES HIGH SCHOOL.

02:02:38.984 --> 02:02:40.052
TO START THINKING ABOUT SOME OF

02:02:40.119 --> 02:02:43.789
THESE AREAS- AND AGAIN MANY OF

02:02:43.856 --> 02:02:47.159
OUR HIGH SCHOOL INSTRUCTORS.

02:02:47.226 --> 02:02:48.561
THEY'RE TEACHING LIKE TWELVE

02:02:48.627 --> 02:02:49.995
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES WITHIN

02:02:50.062 --> 02:02:52.031
AGRICULTURE RIGHT SO WE'VE GOT

02:02:52.098 --> 02:02:53.032
TO GIVE THEM THOSE TOOLS THAT

02:02:53.099 --> 02:02:54.333
THEY CAN PULL OUT OF THE BOX AND

02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:57.403
USE RIGHT IN THE CLASSROOMS SO-

02:02:57.470 --> 02:02:59.138
WE USE ONLINE IT'S A GREAT

02:02:59.205 --> 02:03:01.340
STRATEGY- THERE CERTAIN THINGS

02:03:01.407 --> 02:03:03.876
THAT WE NEED OUR HANDS ON- BUT

02:03:03.943 --> 02:03:05.745
BUT AS A WHOLE WE'RE TRYING TO

02:03:05.811 --> 02:03:06.212
USE ALL THE DIFFERENT

02:03:06.278 --> 02:03:08.881
STRATEGIES. SO WE REMEMBER THE

02:03:08.948 --> 02:03:10.783
FEW MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE IS THE

02:03:10.850 --> 02:03:12.818
I THINK WE SHOULD- MAKE SURE

02:03:12.885 --> 02:03:14.019
THAT WE GET THE FUNDING TO THE

02:03:14.086 --> 02:03:15.755
PARTICULAR THIS HIGH SCHOOL

02:03:15.821 --> 02:03:17.857
AGRICULTURAL TECHNICAL-

02:03:17.923 --> 02:03:19.859
EDUCATION CLASSES BECAUSE ONCE

02:03:19.925 --> 02:03:21.794
AGAIN THIS IS WHERE WE CAN GET

02:03:21.861 --> 02:03:23.295
SOME OF THOSE KIDS TO GET. LOST

02:03:23.362 --> 02:03:26.065
IN THE SHUFFLE AND ONE TEACHER

02:03:26.132 --> 02:03:28.400
IN A SMALL COMMUNITY THE ONLY A

02:03:28.467 --> 02:03:30.236
ONE ACT TEACHER THERE'S NO ONE

02:03:30.302 --> 02:03:31.470
ELSE TO DO IT AND THEN IT JUST

02:03:31.537 --> 02:03:33.405
TAKES THE BASICS AND NOT SOME IS

02:03:33.472 --> 02:03:35.141
TECHNOLOGY THAT WE NEED. OUT IN

02:03:35.207 --> 02:03:37.109
THE FIELD SO- I THINK WE NEED TO

02:03:37.176 --> 02:03:38.844
REALLY RELATE THIS TO MAKE SURE

02:03:38.911 --> 02:03:40.045
THAT WE GET THE FUNDING TO

02:03:40.112 --> 02:03:42.581
SUPPORT TECHNICAL- SO TECHNICAL

02:03:42.648 --> 02:03:44.984
SUPPORT IN THOSE HIGH SCHOOLS.

02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:47.853
EIGHT EXACT AND SEEING THAT THE

02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:49.388
SHOPS ON THAT SIDE OF IT STAY

02:03:49.455 --> 02:03:51.690
OPEN WEEK WE SEE PROGRAMS BUT

02:03:51.757 --> 02:03:54.560
NOW THEY HAVE. AN AG TEACHER BUT

02:03:54.627 --> 02:03:55.761
IT'S NOT THE SAME TYPES OF

02:03:55.828 --> 02:03:56.996
THINGS THAT I WENT THROUGH WHEN

02:03:57.062 --> 02:04:00.800
THERE WAS A ROBUST. HIGH SCHOOL

02:04:00.866 --> 02:04:02.301
PROGRAMS OUT THERE. MYSTERIES

02:04:02.368 --> 02:04:03.202
AND I APPRECIATE THE

02:04:03.269 --> 02:04:06.605
PRESENTATION THE COMMENTS AND-

02:04:06.672 --> 02:04:08.307
YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW HAVING THE

02:04:08.374 --> 02:04:09.942
OPPORTUNITY TO REPRESENT THE

02:04:10.009 --> 02:04:12.311
SALINAS VALLEY- AND YOU KNOW

02:04:12.378 --> 02:04:13.279
HAVING A FIRST HAND

02:04:13.345 --> 02:04:15.481
UNDERSTANDING OF THE INCREDIBLE

02:04:15.548 --> 02:04:17.716
SUCCESS THAT HARD NOW. I HAS

02:04:17.783 --> 02:04:22.354
HAD- WITH THEIR AG PROGRAMS- A

02:04:22.421 --> 02:04:23.889
LOT OF THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE

02:04:23.956 --> 02:04:25.124
WITHOUT THE SUPPORT FROM THE

02:04:25.191 --> 02:04:26.592
INDUSTRY INDUSTRIES PLAYED A

02:04:26.659 --> 02:04:29.762
SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN MAKING THIS

02:04:29.829 --> 02:04:31.397
POSSIBLE I AND SO IF YOU COULD

02:04:31.463 --> 02:04:32.765
SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TOO I THINK

02:04:32.832 --> 02:04:33.966
YOU ALLUDED TO IT IN YOUR

02:04:34.033 --> 02:04:34.867
COMMENTS BUT YOU SPEAK A LITTLE

02:04:34.934 --> 02:04:37.236
BIT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING

02:04:37.303 --> 02:04:39.205
THAT PARTNERSHIP. AND IT REALLY

02:04:39.271 --> 02:04:40.139
IS A MODEL FOR OTHER

02:04:40.206 --> 02:04:41.740
AGRICULTURAL REGIONS ACROSS THE

02:04:41.807 --> 02:04:43.609
STATE LEVERAGING OUR JUNIOR

02:04:43.676 --> 02:04:45.277
COLLEGE SYSTEM TO MAKE THIS

02:04:45.344 --> 02:04:48.113
POSSIBLE TELL IT'S I'M I HAVE

02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:49.014
GOOSE BUMPS JUST BECAUSE I'M

02:04:49.081 --> 02:04:51.116
THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW I MEAN.

02:04:51.183 --> 02:04:52.384
THEIR KIDS WHAT WHAT THE

02:04:52.451 --> 02:04:55.721
AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY'S DID.

02:04:55.788 --> 02:05:00.526
INSULIN IS EXTREMELY RARE

02:05:00.593 --> 02:05:02.461
THROUGHOUT THE NATION YOU SEE IT

02:05:02.528 --> 02:05:05.698
AT LAND GRANT UNIVERSITIES BUT-

02:05:05.764 --> 02:05:08.167
I HAVEN'T BAG STEERING I HAVE TO

02:05:08.234 --> 02:05:10.703
AG STEERING MEETINGS A YEAR.

02:05:10.769 --> 02:05:12.304
THIS IS C. LEVEL EXECUTIVES

02:05:12.371 --> 02:05:14.540
OWNERS PEOPLE WITH NAMES ON THE

02:05:14.607 --> 02:05:17.877
BUILDING. WE CAN LIVE IN A WORLD

02:05:17.943 --> 02:05:19.612
WHERE IT'S A LOT EASIER TO HAVE

02:05:19.678 --> 02:05:21.113
A BIG COMPANY WRITE YOU A CHECK

02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:22.314
THEN HAVE SOMEONE COME IN AND

02:05:22.381 --> 02:05:26.886
SAT DOWN. AND TRULY EXPLAIN WHAT

02:05:26.952 --> 02:05:29.955
THEIR COMPANY NEEDS. VACANCY

02:05:30.022 --> 02:05:31.757
AROUND THE CORNERS THEY CAN SEE

02:05:31.824 --> 02:05:33.592
THINGS THAT FOR ME I CAN WALK

02:05:33.659 --> 02:05:34.927
THROUGH THE FACTORY A THOUSAND

02:05:34.994 --> 02:05:36.896
TIMES AND I'M NOT GOING TO SEE

02:05:36.962 --> 02:05:38.497
ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND TO BE

02:05:38.564 --> 02:05:40.599
ABLE TO HAVE THAT THAT FRONT

02:05:40.666 --> 02:05:43.235
THOSE PEOPLE COMING IN THAT

02:05:43.302 --> 02:05:45.070
MAKES A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE. AND

02:05:45.137 --> 02:05:47.840
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS VERY

02:05:47.907 --> 02:05:49.141
DIFFICULT TO REPLICATE IT'S

02:05:49.208 --> 02:05:51.677
AMAZING TO SEE IT IN SALINAS AND

02:05:51.744 --> 02:05:53.879
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT CHALLENGE

02:05:53.946 --> 02:05:56.015
FOR THE REST OF THE STATE OF

02:05:56.081 --> 02:05:57.883
CALIFORNIA TO TRULY BE THAT

02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:59.952
ENGAGED. THE THING THAT THEY

02:06:00.019 --> 02:06:01.287
THEY ARE ABLE TO GIVE US THAT

02:06:01.353 --> 02:06:03.322
HUGE VISIONING BELL LOT OF

02:06:03.389 --> 02:06:04.590
PLACES THAT HAVE ADVISORY

02:06:04.657 --> 02:06:07.259
COMMITTEES AND THAT'S IMPORTANT

02:06:07.326 --> 02:06:07.860
ADVISORY COMMITTEES ARE THOSE

02:06:07.927 --> 02:06:09.762
THOSE. A LOT OF TIMES AT SEA

02:06:09.828 --> 02:06:10.696
LEVEL EXECUTIVE DOESN'T

02:06:10.763 --> 02:06:12.131
NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT TYPE OF

02:06:12.197 --> 02:06:14.033
SERVO VALVE THEY'RE USING OUT IN

02:06:14.099 --> 02:06:16.468
THE IN THE PLANT. SO WE WANT

02:06:16.535 --> 02:06:17.870

SKILLS THAT WE WANT TO USE. AND

02:06:24.777 --> 02:06:25.945

02:06:26.011 --> 02:06:28.781
HARTNELL- I WAS ABLE TO COME

02:06:28.847 --> 02:06:30.849
OVER AND BE PART OF THAT. AND SO

02:06:30.916 --> 02:06:32.952
THERE THERE AND THEN BECAUSE OF

02:06:33.018 --> 02:06:34.153
THAT THAT GIVES US A COMPETITIVE

02:06:34.219 --> 02:06:35.487
ADVANTAGE WHEN WE'RE APPLYING

02:06:35.554 --> 02:06:37.690
FOR GRANTS. IT GIVES US ALL OF

02:06:37.756 --> 02:06:40.492

BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:06:48.267 --> 02:06:49.501
DON'T TALK ABOUT A LOT ABOUT

02:06:49.568 --> 02:06:51.870
INTERNSHIPS RIGHT IS. YOU TAKE

02:06:51.937 --> 02:06:53.539
AN INTERN AND YOU PUT HIM IN A

02:06:53.605 --> 02:06:57.042
IN A IN A JOB PLACE. THAT TAKES

02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:59.111
THAT EXCELLENT EMPLOYEE AND MAKE

02:06:59.178 --> 02:07:00.012
SOME ABOUT HALF AS EFFICIENT AS

02:07:00.079 --> 02:07:02.982
THEY WERE BEFORE. BUT IF YOU DO

02:07:03.048 --> 02:07:04.817
THAT LONG ENOUGH AND WE CAN

02:07:04.883 --> 02:07:06.585
SCALE IT MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WE

02:07:06.652 --> 02:07:07.786
CAN GET THEM OUT THERE AND AGAIN

02:07:07.853 --> 02:07:09.621

BROADBAND INTERNET HOLLYWOOD

02:19:12.043 --> 02:19:13.111
FORTY YEARS AGO BECAUSE I'VE

02:19:13.178 --> 02:19:14.479
BEEN PREACHING TO THE CHOIR IN

02:19:14.546 --> 02:19:15.480
THIS BUILDING FOR YEARS WE

02:19:15.547 --> 02:19:17.348
FINALLY GOT THE BILL THROUGH BUT

02:19:17.415 --> 02:19:18.950
LIKE ANYTHING IT TAKES TIME TO

02:19:19.017 --> 02:19:20.518
IMPLEMENT BUT WE'RE WE'RE DOING

02:19:20.585 --> 02:19:23.455
IT SO. BUT YOU KNOW- I WAS

02:19:23.521 --> 02:19:24.756
TALKED EARLIER ABOUT ONE OF THE

02:19:24.823 --> 02:19:25.623
CLIENTS I WENT OUT TO

02:19:25.690 --> 02:19:27.726
CONSTITUENTS YESTERDAY CUSTOM

GET IN INTERNET FROM TO HIS

02:19:30.662 --> 02:19:32.831
BUSINESS AND BREAKS MY HEART

02:19:32.897 --> 02:19:35.800
THAT HE HAD TO GO DO THAT AND

02:19:35.867 --> 02:19:36.434
HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO. DO

02:19:36.501 --> 02:19:38.136
SOME KIND OF INCENTIVES FOR SOME

02:19:38.203 --> 02:19:39.270
OF THE- OTHER POINT THAT YOU

02:19:39.337 --> 02:19:40.205
BROUGHT UP THAT I THINK THAT WE

02:19:40.271 --> 02:19:43.241
pAGING WORKFORCE. THEIR WORK

02:19:43.308 --> 02:19:44.676
FORCES OUT IN THE FIELDS RIGHT

02:19:44.743 --> 02:19:46.344
NOW THEY'RE NOT AS MANY BUT THE

02:19:46.411 --> 02:19:48.146
WORK FORCE'S OLDER. AND THEN WE

02:19:48.213 --> 02:19:51.149
DO NEED TO BACK FILL WITH SOME.

02:19:51.216 --> 02:19:52.917
TECHNOLOGY AND STUDENTS AND-

02:19:52.984 --> 02:19:54.886
PEOPLE THAT UNDERSTAND THAT

02:19:54.953 --> 02:19:56.821
AGRICULTURE IS A REALLY GOOD

02:19:56.888 --> 02:19:59.124
VIBRANT JOB. AND FOR ME I'VE

02:19:59.190 --> 02:20:01.126
OWNED A FARM WITH MY BROTHERS

02:20:01.192 --> 02:20:01.760
AND THERE'S NOTHING BETTER THAN

02:20:01.826 --> 02:20:04.062
THE FRESH AIR. TO BE OUTSIDE THE

02:20:04.129 --> 02:20:05.730
TOUCH THE DIRTAND PLANT

02:20:05.797 --> 02:20:07.031
SOMETHING AND WATCH IT GROW I

02:20:07.098 --> 02:20:10.235
MEAN I HAVE THIS WHOLE DIFFERENT

02:20:10.301 --> 02:20:10.835
FEELING THAT MAYBE SOME PEOPLE

02:20:10.902 --> 02:20:12.170
DO. ONE OF THE THINGS I'M

02:20:12.237 --> 02:20:14.305
LOOKING AT HIM I. WOULD LOVE TO

02:20:14.372 --> 02:20:16.341
HAVE. YOUR COMMENTS AND I THINK

02:20:16.407 --> 02:20:18.143
THE NEXT THREE. IS THAT THERE'S

02:20:18.209 --> 02:20:20.612
A LOT OF FAMILY FARMS THAT ARE

02:20:20.678 --> 02:20:23.214
PRETTY LARGE. AND THEIR SISTER

02:20:23.281 --> 02:20:25.316
THEY WERE HOPING TO PASS IT DOWN

02:20:25.383 --> 02:20:27.552
TO THE FAMILY. AND THEIR

02:20:27.619 --> 02:20:29.821
CHILDREN. QUITE APART NECESSARY

02:20:29.888 --> 02:20:32.056
INTERESTED. AND THEY DON'T WANT

02:20:32.123 --> 02:20:33.792
TO LOSE IT SO YOU KNOW AS WE GET

02:20:33.858 --> 02:20:35.360
OLDER WE WANT TO HOLD ON TO OUR

02:20:35.426 --> 02:20:39.764
LAND- LOOKING AT MAYBE- DOING.

02:20:39.831 --> 02:20:43.001
SMALLER FARMS PLUS. AND MAYBE

02:20:43.067 --> 02:20:45.804
GIVING THE A FARMER OF THE MAIN

02:20:45.870 --> 02:20:48.239
PROPERTY- OWNER A TAX CREDIT. TO

02:20:48.306 --> 02:20:50.675
MAYBE DO A LEASE FOR MAYBE

02:20:50.742 --> 02:20:52.710
THIRTY OR FORTY ACRES ON THEIR

02:20:52.777 --> 02:20:54.679
PROPERTY. I'M TRYING TO THINK

02:20:54.746 --> 02:20:55.914
OUTSIDE THE BOX BECAUSE I DON'T

02:20:55.980 --> 02:20:57.916
WANT TO LOSE MY FARMS. AND I

02:20:57.982 --> 02:20:59.717
DON'T WANT TO ALL TO BE SOLD TO

02:20:59.784 --> 02:21:00.952
CORPORATIONS BUT I'D LIKE TO BE

02:21:01.019 --> 02:21:03.421
ABLE TO KEEP THAT YOU HAVE ANY

02:21:03.488 --> 02:21:04.656
THOUGHTS ON THAT. YOU KNOW WEEK

02:21:04.722 --> 02:21:06.057
WE PROBABLY SEE MORE FARMS FOR

02:21:06.124 --> 02:21:09.460
SALE. LARGE LARGER FAMILY FARMS

02:21:09.527 --> 02:21:10.094
FOR SALE THAT I'VE EVER SEEN IN

02:21:10.161 --> 02:21:12.363
MY LIFETIME. THERE IS A THERE'S

02:21:12.430 --> 02:21:14.566
A JEFF DEFINITE GENERATIONAL

02:21:14.632 --> 02:21:17.168
CHANGE HAPPENING. THAT COUPLED

02:21:17.235 --> 02:21:19.804
WITH- I THINK A LOT OF THE

02:21:19.871 --> 02:21:22.941
FARMERS HAVE JUST- HAD ENOUGH OF

02:21:23.007 --> 02:21:25.877
THE REGULATIONS- IT'S TOUGH

02:21:25.944 --> 02:21:27.912
FARMING IN CALIFORNIA MORE SO

02:21:27.979 --> 02:21:28.479
THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE

02:21:28.546 --> 02:21:30.915
UNION. I THINK WE HAVE TO BE

02:21:30.982 --> 02:21:33.318
CREATIVE. WE WANT TO KEEP THE

02:21:33.384 --> 02:21:34.786
LAND AND PRODUCTION AS WELL AS

02:21:34.853 --> 02:21:37.055
WE CAN AS YOU KNOW THE WATER

02:21:37.121 --> 02:21:38.156
ISSUES IN CALIFORNIA ARE

02:21:38.223 --> 02:21:40.925
TREMENDOUS. ASHLEY DOWN AND IN

02:21:40.992 --> 02:21:43.428
OUR REGION- WERE WERE IN A

02:21:43.494 --> 02:21:45.330
CRITICALLY OVER DRAFTED BASIN.

02:21:45.396 --> 02:21:48.366
SO I WOULD THINK ANY OPPORTUNITY

02:21:48.433 --> 02:21:51.669
TO KEEP THE FARM. IN PRODUCTION.

02:21:51.736 --> 02:21:53.838
IF IT IF IT MEANS SPLITTING IT

02:21:53.905 --> 02:21:56.808
UP LEASING GROUND- TO OTHER

02:21:56.875 --> 02:21:58.610
FARMERS GIVING THEM THE

02:21:58.676 --> 02:22:01.179
OPPORTUNITY TO FARM I THINK

02:22:01.246 --> 02:22:03.748
FANTASTIC. WE GET IT IS A

02:22:03.815 --> 02:22:06.217
DIFFICULT CHALLENGE IT'S HUGE

02:22:06.284 --> 02:22:06.851
CHALLENGE ROOM BECAUSE THE PRICE

02:22:06.918 --> 02:22:09.587
OF EQUIPMENT COMPUTERS THE NEW

02:22:09.654 --> 02:22:11.856
WATER YOUR ATTENTION SYSTEMS BUT

02:22:11.923 --> 02:22:14.058
I LOOK AT- A GROUP THAT'S HERE

02:22:14.125 --> 02:22:15.226
NOR THE CALIFORNIA CENTER FOR

02:22:15.293 --> 02:22:16.895
BLAND BUT BIT PLAN BASED

02:22:16.961 --> 02:22:18.296
LEARNING AND THEY'RE TEACHING

02:22:18.363 --> 02:22:20.198
PEOPLE TO BE FARMERS EXACTLY AND

02:22:20.265 --> 02:22:21.933
THEY'RE GONNA BE FAR IN BUT THEY

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:23.701
CAN'T AFFORD THE LAND THEY CAN'T

02:22:23.768 --> 02:22:25.103
GET THE FINANCING IN THE YOU

02:22:25.169 --> 02:22:27.005
KNOW. SO I'M JUST TRYING TO

02:22:27.071 --> 02:22:28.072
THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX IS HOW CAN

02:22:28.139 --> 02:22:30.909
WE KEEP THE LAND THE LAND THAT I

02:22:30.975 --> 02:22:33.077
LOVE IN MANY LOVE. AND KEEP IT

02:22:33.144 --> 02:22:34.846
VIABLE THING MAKE SURE X. THREE

02:22:34.913 --> 02:22:36.714
MEANS OF PRODUCTION SO YOU KNOW

02:22:36.781 --> 02:22:38.483
WHAT I IF YOU HAVE ANYWHERE IN

02:22:38.549 --> 02:22:39.851
THE NATION THIS DOING SOMETHING

02:22:39.918 --> 02:22:41.753
CREATIVE OR I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR

02:22:41.819 --> 02:22:44.322
THAT BUT- ONE OF MY GOOD FRIENDS

02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:45.356
RICHARD ROMINGER WHO RECENTLY

02:22:45.423 --> 02:22:47.492
PASSED AWAY WAS A VERY I ADAM

02:22:47.558 --> 02:22:48.826
AND WORKED WITH ME IS TRYING TO

02:22:48.893 --> 02:22:50.628
FIGURE OUT HOW WE COULD DO THAT.

02:22:50.695 --> 02:22:52.363
AND SO- I WOULD APPRECIATE ANY

02:22:52.430 --> 02:22:53.932
KIND OF INPUT THE MOVE YOU OR

02:22:53.998 --> 02:22:56.200
OTHERS MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE US

02:22:56.267 --> 02:22:57.802
NO I AGREE THAT RICHARD WAS A

02:22:57.869 --> 02:22:59.904
FRIEND OF MINE AS WELL YEAH.

02:22:59.971 --> 02:23:02.073
VERY WONDERFUL PERSON AND I AM

02:23:02.140 --> 02:23:03.441
NOT UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT OF

02:23:03.508 --> 02:23:07.812
EXPERIENCE IN THE AND WISDOM.

02:23:07.879 --> 02:23:09.380
YEAH BUT- I SEE THERE ARE YOU

02:23:09.447 --> 02:23:11.549
KNOW TO GET INTO FARMING DON'T

02:23:11.616 --> 02:23:12.150
AS YOU SAID YOU. HAVE TO THE

02:23:12.216 --> 02:23:15.353
LAND. YOU CAN LEASE LAND. AND

02:23:15.420 --> 02:23:17.455
THERE'S IN SECURITY WITH THAT.

02:23:17.522 --> 02:23:19.324
BUT IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT MATCH

02:23:19.390 --> 02:23:21.359
UP. I THINK I THINK IT'S A

02:23:21.426 --> 02:23:23.328
VIABLE OPTION IT'S A GOOD WAY TO

02:23:23.394 --> 02:23:24.896
GET PEOPLE INVOLVED IN IT IN IN

02:23:24.963 --> 02:23:28.333
FARMING- IACTUALLY HAD NO FORM

02:23:28.399 --> 02:23:31.970
BACKGROUND- BEFORE I GOT

02:23:32.036 --> 02:23:33.538
INVOLVED IN AGRICULTURE. AT IT

02:23:33.604 --> 02:23:35.773
AS YOU SAY THERE'S SOMETHING

02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:36.741
ABOUT BEING OUT THERE PLANTING

02:23:36.808 --> 02:23:39.877
SEEDS WATCHING THINGS GROW

02:23:39.944 --> 02:23:41.946
PRODUCING CROPS THAT REALLY THAT

02:23:42.013 --> 02:23:44.449
FEED THE WORLD AND- IT'S VERY

02:23:44.515 --> 02:23:46.484
SATISFYING. AND I WOULDN'T TRADE

02:23:46.551 --> 02:23:50.254
IT FOR ANYTHING YEAH THAT BUT

02:23:50.321 --> 02:23:50.888
YOU KNOW THAT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN

02:23:50.955 --> 02:23:52.690
TO SOME. LET'S FACE IT TO A HIGH

02:23:52.757 --> 02:23:55.994
SCHOOL STUDENT. OR TO SOMEONE-

02:23:56.060 --> 02:23:58.830
EARLY IN THEIR COLLEGE CAREER-

02:23:58.896 --> 02:24:00.331
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO DO A

02:24:00.398 --> 02:24:03.401
BETTER JOB OF. OF BRINGING

02:24:03.468 --> 02:24:06.337
PEOPLE INTO AGRICULTURE. I SEE.

02:24:06.404 --> 02:24:08.006
AND I THINK THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

02:24:08.072 --> 02:24:10.508
THE COMMONALITY I THINK THAT

02:24:10.575 --> 02:24:13.144
THOSE WHO LIVE IN A FARM

02:24:13.211 --> 02:24:15.246
ENVIRONMENT. TEND TO TAKE IT FOR

02:24:15.313 --> 02:24:17.181
GRANTED THEY DON'T LOOK AT IT AS

02:24:17.248 --> 02:24:21.686
AN OPPORTUNITY AS A CAREER PATH-

02:24:21.753 --> 02:24:22.553
I THINK THAT IF THEY LOOK BEYOND

02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:25.890
THAT. AND SOMEHOW WE NEED TO

02:24:25.957 --> 02:24:26.524
MAKE THE CHANGE WE NEED TO SHOW

02:24:26.591 --> 02:24:29.027
THEM THAT- THAT IT CAN BE

02:24:29.093 --> 02:24:30.928
EXCITING AND IT CAN BE REALLY

02:24:30.995 --> 02:24:33.097
REALLY REWARDING AND A GREAT

02:24:33.164 --> 02:24:37.268
PLACE TO WORK IN A LOT OF. IT IS

02:24:37.335 --> 02:24:38.002
A CHALLENGE I WOULD REMEMBER

02:24:38.069 --> 02:24:40.638
NINE CHANGE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT

02:24:40.705 --> 02:24:41.205
THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:24:41.272 --> 02:24:44.042
COMMENTS. YEAH RICH WAS VERY

02:24:44.108 --> 02:24:47.111
DIFFERENT WHEN TO. DISTRIBUTE

02:24:47.178 --> 02:24:47.879
THANK YOU I WOULD JUST LIKE TO

02:24:47.945 --> 02:24:49.380
MAKE A COMMENT ON- YOU KNOW I

02:24:49.447 --> 02:24:50.782
SHARED EARLIER THAT I'VE VISITED

02:24:50.848 --> 02:24:53.051
ABOUT ELEVEN FIVE OF ELEVEN I'VE

02:24:53.117 --> 02:24:55.186
BEEN ON ELEVEN TEARS- TO TWO

02:24:55.253 --> 02:24:56.654
DIFFERENT FARMS AND- YOU KNOW I

02:24:56.721 --> 02:24:58.322
HEAR THE SAME THINGS OVER AND

02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:58.823
OVER AGAIN HOW ABOUT HOW

02:24:58.890 --> 02:25:00.324
DIFFICULT IT IS BUT- YET WHEN I

02:25:00.391 --> 02:25:02.427
SPEAK TO YOU AND TO. THOSE OF

LIGHT UP WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

02:25:05.096 --> 02:25:06.998
WHAT YOU DO AND SO I THINK PART

02:25:07.065 --> 02:25:09.167
OF THE MESSAGE IS NOT GETTING

02:25:09.233 --> 02:25:10.301
ACROSS TO THE YOUNGER

02:25:10.368 --> 02:25:13.204

IT IS AND SOLD AT YOU KNOW I

02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:17.308
DON'T CLAIM TO HAVE A SOLUTION

02:25:17.375 --> 02:25:19.644
TO THAT OBVIOUSLY BUT- I THINK

02:25:19.710 --> 02:25:22.647
YOU KNOW WILL THE- ADVANTAGES OF

02:25:22.713 --> 02:25:23.948

HIGHLIGHTED- MORE OFTEN AND- NOT

02:25:26.918 --> 02:25:28.820

REST OF THE COUNTRY THAT'S

02:25:32.890 --> 02:25:35.026
REALLY SOMETHING IMPORTANT AND

02:25:35.093 --> 02:25:36.527
CRITICAL IF YOU KNOW A WHOLE

02:25:36.594 --> 02:25:38.696
BUNCH WAS GIVEN TO. POLITICS

02:25:38.763 --> 02:25:40.598
MAINLY TO HELP SOMEBODY RIGHT

02:25:40.665 --> 02:25:41.899

02:25:41.966 --> 02:25:43.868
OF THE DEVIL CALIFORNIA AND THE

02:25:43.935 --> 02:25:45.036

THAT INFORMATION TO NEW FARMERS

02:28:36.807 --> 02:28:37.842

THE DEPLOYMENT OF SMART AND

02:35:07.364 --> 02:35:09.033
CLEAN. TECHNOLOGIES ARE

02:35:09.099 --> 02:35:10.768
PRINCIPALLY ARE ZERO EMISSION

02:35:10.834 --> 02:35:15.305
TRACTOR. WE'VE HIGHLIGHTED-

02:35:15.372 --> 02:35:16.774
THREE OF MANY CHALLENGES THAT

02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:19.243
FARMERS ARE FACING TODAY-

02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:20.644
PRINCIPALLY- LABOR SHORTAGES

02:35:20.711 --> 02:35:22.980
WHICH WE'VE DISCUSSED. HERE WITH

02:35:23.047 --> 02:35:25.115
SOME OF THE OTHER PANELISTS-

02:35:25.182 --> 02:35:26.784
BOTH FROM A ABSOLUTE SENSE IN

02:35:26.850 --> 02:35:27.951
TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF WORKERS

02:35:28.018 --> 02:35:29.820
AS WELL AS THE SKILL SETS. THAT

02:35:29.887 --> 02:35:31.822
ARE NEEDED NOW AND MOVING INTO

02:35:31.889 --> 02:35:34.091
THE FUTURE OF AGRICULTURE. WE'RE

02:35:34.158 --> 02:35:35.592
ALSO SEEING INCREASED SCRUTINY

02:35:35.659 --> 02:35:38.395
ON OUR FOOD ECOSYSTEM OUR-

02:35:38.462 --> 02:35:39.496
PEOPLE WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE

02:35:39.563 --> 02:35:41.665
THEIR FOOD COMES FROM- WHAT KIND

02:35:41.732 --> 02:35:43.634
OF CHEMICALS AND PROCESSES ARE.

02:35:43.701 --> 02:35:44.835
DONE TO ACTUALLY PRODUCE THAT

02:35:44.902 --> 02:35:46.070
FOOD AND WHAT THE EMISSIONS

02:35:46.136 --> 02:35:47.771
IMPACT OF THAT FOOD PRODUCTION

02:35:47.838 --> 02:35:51.075
AREAS ARE ESPECIALLY. AS WE

02:35:51.141 --> 02:35:52.810
START TO. RESTAURANTS AROUND

02:35:52.876 --> 02:35:53.711
CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHAT WE'RE

02:35:53.777 --> 02:35:56.013
GONNA DO ABOUT IT. AND FOR SOME

02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:57.481
CONTACTS THERE- YEAH I'M A

02:35:57.548 --> 02:35:58.582
FORMER FIRST AND I NEVER

02:35:58.649 --> 02:36:00.050
IMAGINED MYSELF INVOLVED IN A

02:36:00.117 --> 02:36:01.251
TECHNOLOGY COMPANY BUT I'M

02:36:01.318 --> 02:36:03.854
INCREDIBLY EXCITED- MY FIRST

02:36:03.921 --> 02:36:05.055
GOAL WAS TO FIND A WAY THAT WE

02:36:05.122 --> 02:36:06.924
COULD BRIDGE AWAY FROM DANGEROUS

02:36:06.990 --> 02:36:09.093
CHEMICALS ON FARMS. I HOW CAN

02:36:09.159 --> 02:36:09.893
GET AWAY FROM HERBICIDES AND

02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:11.128
UNIQUE IT'S A NOISE TO PROTECT

02:36:11.195 --> 02:36:12.396
OUR FARM BIOLOGY ARE SOIL

02:36:12.463 --> 02:36:14.398
MICROBIOMES PROTECT ACT YOU KNOW

02:36:14.465 --> 02:36:15.599
WHAT THE BEES FROM COLONY

02:36:15.666 --> 02:36:16.734
COLLAPSE DISORDER IN. THE

02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:17.468
MONARCH BUTTERFLIES ARE

02:36:17.534 --> 02:36:21.071
DISAPPEARING AND- THEN IN TWENTY

02:36:21.138 --> 02:36:22.005
FIFTEEN MY FAMILY LOST HALF OF

02:36:22.072 --> 02:36:23.407
OUR CROP DUE TO DROUGHT AT MY

02:36:23.474 --> 02:36:29.012
FAMILY'S IN THE WINE BUSINESS I. 201730% DUE TO WILDFIRE.

02:36:29.079 --> 02:36:30.714
TWENTY TWENTY A 100% OF OUR CROP

02:36:30.781 --> 02:36:32.382
DUE TO SMOKE TAINT. AND QUICKLY

02:36:32.449 --> 02:36:35.018
REALIZED THAT. IF WE DON'T

02:36:35.085 --> 02:36:35.786
PROTECT OUR CLIMATE AND THE

02:36:35.853 --> 02:36:37.454
PLANET. THAT WHO CARES ABOUT THE

02:36:37.521 --> 02:36:38.889
FATE SO I COMBINED WILL HAVE A

02:36:38.956 --> 02:36:41.625
FORM THE FORM ON. IT I QUICKLY

02:36:41.692 --> 02:36:42.726
REALIZED WE NEEDED TO WORK ON

02:36:42.793 --> 02:36:44.628
THAT- MARC IS AN ALL ELECTRIC

02:36:44.695 --> 02:36:46.897
DRIVER OPTIONAL SMART TRACTOR.

02:36:46.964 --> 02:36:48.232
BY TEEN DRIVER OPTIONAL WERE

02:36:48.298 --> 02:36:49.833
ABLE TO BRIDGE A LOT OF THE

02:36:49.900 --> 02:36:50.868
DIVIDES THAT SEPARATE CLEAN

02:36:50.934 --> 02:36:53.003
FARMING- FROM FROM CONVENTIONAL

02:36:53.070 --> 02:36:55.105
FARMING- BY BEING ELECTRIC WERE

02:36:55.172 --> 02:36:56.073
ABLE TO BRIDGE THE CARBON

02:36:56.140 --> 02:36:57.841
FOOTPRINT ASSOCIATED- AND THEN.

02:36:57.908 --> 02:36:59.743
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT THE LABOR

02:36:59.810 --> 02:37:01.879
POOL- MY BIGGEST GOAL IS TO

02:37:01.945 --> 02:37:04.181
PROTECT OUR OUR FARM TEAMS. SO

02:37:04.248 --> 02:37:05.516
RIGHT NOW. I GREW UP MY FIRST

02:37:05.582 --> 02:37:07.885
JOB AND FARMING. WAS AYE AYE

02:37:07.951 --> 02:37:09.686
MECHANIC'S ASSISTANT. AND HE

02:37:09.753 --> 02:37:10.888
WOULD ALWAYS TELL ME THE MOST

02:37:10.954 --> 02:37:11.955
DANGEROUS PLACE ON THIS FARMS

02:37:12.022 --> 02:37:13.357
THE TRACTOR SEAT. AT NOT JUST

02:37:13.423 --> 02:37:14.892
FROM POTENTIALLY IT ROLLING

02:37:14.958 --> 02:37:16.894
OVER. UT ALSO YOU HAVE T PUT

02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:18.162
ON A HAZMAT SUIT EVEN TO SPRAY

02:37:18.228 --> 02:37:19.563
ORGANIC CONTEXT REYES NOT TO

02:37:19.630 --> 02:37:20.531
MENTION THE VERY DANGEROUS

02:37:20.597 --> 02:37:22.166
CONVENTIONAL SPRAYS THAT CAN BE.

02:37:22.232 --> 02:37:24.001
QUITE THE WORST TO BREED. AND

02:37:24.067 --> 02:37:26.003
SO- BY BEING A THOMAS WERE ABLE

02:37:26.069 --> 02:37:27.404
TO PROTECT OUR FARMERS AND THAT

02:37:27.471 --> 02:37:28.906
WAY. PROTECTED FROM THE DANGERS

02:37:28.972 --> 02:37:30.507
POSITION IN THE SEAT- AND THEN

02:37:30.574 --> 02:37:33.043
ALSO- DEAL A BIT WITH THE LABOR

02:37:33.110 --> 02:37:35.646
SHORTAGE WHICH IS- NOT.

02:37:35.712 --> 02:37:36.346
BENEFICIAL YEAH OUR SERVICE

02:37:36.413 --> 02:37:37.981
CARLOS TO OUR FARMERS ARE

02:37:38.048 --> 02:37:39.383
LOOKING FOR AUTOMATION ACTUAL

02:37:39.449 --> 02:37:40.851
INSIGHTS BASED ON REAL DATA

02:37:40.918 --> 02:37:42.920
COLLECTED ON FIELD ARE AND HOW

02:37:42.986 --> 02:37:45.622
MUCH VACATION. AND SO ARE WE

02:37:45.689 --> 02:37:46.824
BUILT ON OUR TRACTOR PLATFORM I

02:37:46.890 --> 02:37:48.058
ASK OUR LOADED IT'S A FULLY

02:37:48.125 --> 02:37:49.860
ELECTRIC COMPACT TRACTOR- FORTY

02:37:49.927 --> 02:37:52.095
HORSEPOWER ARE MOSTLY SEEN. IN

02:37:52.162 --> 02:37:54.131
THE VENDOR MARKETS BUT WE DO R.

02:37:54.198 --> 02:37:56.266
I SEE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY

02:37:56.333 --> 02:37:57.201
FIVE THOUSAND UNITS. PRODUCED

02:37:57.267 --> 02:37:58.202
AND WE ARE HERE IN THE UNITED

02:37:58.268 --> 02:38:00.237
STATES. ARE HERE WE'VE BUILT

02:38:00.304 --> 02:38:01.572
FROM THE GROUND UP USING

02:38:01.638 --> 02:38:02.873
EXISTING COMPONENTS AND-

02:38:02.940 --> 02:38:04.908
LEVERAGING THE AUTOMOTIVE AND

02:38:04.975 --> 02:38:06.543
AGRICULTURAL SUPPLY CHAINS ARE.

02:38:06.610 --> 02:38:08.445
ALSO ADDING MANY OF THE COOL

02:38:08.512 --> 02:38:10.113
SENSORS THAT ENABLE THE DRIVER

02:38:10.180 --> 02:38:12.349
OPTIONAL. TECHNOLOGY AND SO WE

02:38:12.416 --> 02:38:14.151
HAVE ALL OF THE SAME INPUTS THAT

02:38:14.218 --> 02:38:15.485
YOU SEE ON AN EXISTING DIESEL

02:38:15.552 --> 02:38:17.120
TRACTOR. OUR FARMERS CAN GET ON

02:38:17.187 --> 02:38:18.155
AND AN OPERATOR AFTER JUST IKE

02:38:18.222 --> 02:38:19.756
THEY WITH THEIR TRADITIONAL ONE.

02:38:19.823 --> 02:38:21.558
BUT IT'S ALSO ABLE TO EXECUTE

02:38:21.625 --> 02:38:22.793
SOME OF THESE ROUTES ARE

02:38:22.860 --> 02:38:31.368
AUTONOMOUSLY AND DO SOME WORK. I

02:38:31.435 --> 02:38:32.936
WITHOUT AN OPERATOR ON BOARD. I

02:38:33.003 --> 02:38:34.605
AM BECAUSE OF THIS. TO LOOK AT

02:38:34.671 --> 02:38:35.572
SOME PRETTY SO. IMPACTS ARE TO

02:38:35.639 --> 02:38:38.008
THE FARM ARE NOT. ABOUT TWO

02:38:38.075 --> 02:38:39.042
THOUSAND. A YEAR AND A- SAVINGS

02:38:39.109 --> 02:38:41.879
AND- THREE. OF CO TWO A- ARE

02:38:41.945 --> 02:38:43.447
BEING RE. ON A TRACTOR PER YEAR

02:38:43.513 --> 02:38:44.982
. BASIS AND SO- THIS. QUICKLY

02:38:45.048 --> 02:38:47.651
START TO ADD UP TO SOME SERIOUS

02:38:47.718 --> 02:38:50.254
NUMBERS- AND QUICKLY WERE BACKED

02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:52.222
BY SOME OF THE BIGGEST NAMES IN

02:38:52.289 --> 02:38:54.358
AGRICULTURE- MR CASE NEW HOLLAND

02:38:54.424 --> 02:38:55.893
INDUSTRIAL IS ONE OF THE LARGEST

02:38:55.959 --> 02:38:58.061
AGRICULTURAL. PRODUCERS OF

02:38:58.128 --> 02:38:59.696
MACHINERY AND THE OF WORLD ARE

02:38:59.763 --> 02:39:00.530
THEY HAVE INVESTED IN MODERN

02:39:00.597 --> 02:39:02.699
TRACTOR AS WELL AS MUSASHI WHO

02:39:02.766 --> 02:39:03.634
IS A TIER ONE AUTOMOTIVE

02:39:03.700 --> 02:39:05.135
SUPPLIER. TRIMBLE WHO DOES A

02:39:05.202 --> 02:39:07.004
VARIETY OF AG TAX SOFTWARE AND

02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:09.406
HARDWARE- HAS A- A RARE

02:39:09.473 --> 02:39:11.375
SATELLITES TO BE USED FOR RTK

02:39:11.441 --> 02:39:13.710
CORRECTIONS. AND VEACH V. S. T.

02:39:13.777 --> 02:39:15.812
R. WHO DIES ARE- ONE OF THE MAIN

02:39:15.879 --> 02:39:17.214
MANUFACTURERS OF TRACTORS OUT OF

02:39:17.281 --> 02:39:19.383
INDIA. RECENTLY WE ALSO

02:39:19.449 --> 02:39:22.152
ANNOUNCED THAT CNH HAS LICENSED

02:39:22.219 --> 02:39:23.320
THE MONARCH TRACTOR TECHNOLOGY

02:39:23.387 --> 02:39:25.155
AND WILL BE APPLYING IT TO THEIR

02:39:25.222 --> 02:39:26.356
PRODUCT LINES. IN THE COMING

02:39:26.423 --> 02:39:27.925
YEAR SO WE REALLY ARE SEEING

02:39:27.991 --> 02:39:29.660
THIS TECHNOLOGY START TO I COME

02:39:29.726 --> 02:39:31.295
INTO ITS OWN AND- AND START

02:39:31.361 --> 02:39:32.562
PERSONALLY YEAH THIS IS SO

02:39:32.629 --> 02:39:34.398
IMPORTANT BECAUSE- YOU KNOW.

02:39:34.464 --> 02:39:35.899
OVER A QUARTER OF OUR PLANET'S

02:39:35.966 --> 02:39:37.000
CARBON FOOTPRINTS COMING FROM

02:39:37.067 --> 02:39:39.002
AGRICULTURE SO HAVING- THE

02:39:39.069 --> 02:39:40.203
SECOND LARGEST TRACTOR COMPANY

02:39:40.270 --> 02:39:41.038
IN THE WORLD LICENSE OUR

02:39:41.104 --> 02:39:42.339
TECHNOLOGY WILL HELP US MEET OUR

02:39:42.406 --> 02:39:44.074
SUSTAINABILITY GOALS. NOT JUST

02:39:44.141 --> 02:39:46.076
WITH AND MARK AS A COMPANY BUT-

02:39:46.143 --> 02:39:48.111
AS A PLANET AS WE- FIGHT TO.

02:39:48.178 --> 02:39:49.012
DEAL WITH WHAT WE'RE DEALING

02:39:49.079 --> 02:39:51.815
WITH YEAH. SO WHAT WE SEE IS

02:39:51.882 --> 02:39:54.117
TECHNOLOGY IS NOT A BARRIER TO

02:39:54.184 --> 02:39:56.720
ADOPTING THIS FORMAL EDUCATION.

02:39:56.787 --> 02:39:58.956
OUR FARMERS THAT WE TALK TO THEY

02:39:59.022 --> 02:40:00.490
SAY THAT THEY NEED REGULATIONS

02:40:00.557 --> 02:40:02.059
ALIGNS WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF

02:40:02.125 --> 02:40:04.328
TECHNOLOGY WHICH WILL GONNA DIVE

02:40:04.394 --> 02:40:05.595
INTO A LITTLE BIT FURTHER HERE.

02:40:05.662 --> 02:40:07.130
ARE THEY ALSO NEED INCENTIVES TO

02:40:07.197 --> 02:40:09.099
SWAP OUT THEIR EXISTING DIESEL

02:40:09.166 --> 02:40:10.434
EQUIPMENT. FOR NEW ZERO EMISSION

02:40:10.500 --> 02:40:12.035
ONE SIDE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

02:40:12.102 --> 02:40:13.370
FOR A ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE ARE

02:40:13.437 --> 02:40:15.272
HIGHER ON THE OFFSET- BUT WE DO

02:40:15.339 --> 02:40:17.441
MAKE THAT MONEY BACK TO- BUT

02:40:17.507 --> 02:40:18.875
FARMING IT'S ARE. A LOW MARGIN

02:40:18.942 --> 02:40:20.210
BUSINESS AND SO IT'S DIFFERENT

02:40:20.277 --> 02:40:21.778
SOMETIMES REFORMS TO ACTUALLY

02:40:21.845 --> 02:40:23.413
MAKE THE TRANSITION. UP

02:40:23.480 --> 02:40:24.715
INCENTIVES AND WE'VE HAD GOOD

02:40:24.781 --> 02:40:27.551
SUPPORT FROM OUR OUR CARBON AND

02:40:27.617 --> 02:40:28.752
THE CC ARE THERE STARTED TO

02:40:28.819 --> 02:40:31.188
THINK ABOUT HOW TO RUN OUR ZERO

02:40:31.254 --> 02:40:32.122
EMISSION EQUIPMENT IN. THE

02:40:32.189 --> 02:40:33.690
CURRENT PLAN WORKS AND WHAT THE

02:40:33.757 --> 02:40:35.025
FRAMEWORKS OF THE FUTURE LOOK

02:40:35.092 --> 02:40:35.926
LIKE TO INCENTIVIZE THE

02:40:35.993 --> 02:40:38.695
TRANSITION- AND ADDITIONALLY

02:40:38.762 --> 02:40:39.830
FARMERS ARE ASKING FOR

02:40:39.896 --> 02:40:40.964
INFRASTRUCTURE AND CHARGING

02:40:41.031 --> 02:40:42.599
SUPPORT- SO THAT WE CAN

02:40:42.666 --> 02:40:44.067
ACTUALLY. DEPLOY THESE

02:40:44.134 --> 02:40:45.569
TECHNOLOGIES AT SCALE YEAH AND

02:40:45.635 --> 02:40:46.636
YOU KNOW THERE'S A RECENT

02:40:46.703 --> 02:40:55.212
MCKINSEY- STUDY THAT SHE- DECK

02:40:55.278 --> 02:40:56.480
BY ELECTRIFY. FARMING IT'S THE

02:40:56.546 --> 02:40:57.147
SINGLE GREATEST THING THE WE CAN

02:40:57.214 --> 02:40:58.048
DO. TO HELP- DEAL WITH THAT

02:40:58.115 --> 02:40:59.016
CARBON FIBER ON THE ON THE

02:40:59.082 --> 02:41:01.151
IMPLEMENTS. ON THE ON THE- SIDE

02:41:01.218 --> 02:41:03.253
SEES ME- ANOTHER THING THAT'S

02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:03.887
IMPORTANT IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:41:03.954 --> 02:41:05.088
LAW. DECADE I FOR BEEN FORMER

02:41:05.155 --> 02:41:06.289
FOR A HUNDRED. ELASTICATED A

02:41:06.356 --> 02:41:07.090
DECADE THAT WE'VE HAD. SOME

02:41:07.157 --> 02:41:09.026
SEVERE. GIVEN EVERYTHING TO TAP

02:41:09.092 --> 02:41:11.828
. IT'S A- AT HAD ENOUGH SUBS YOU

02:41:11.895 --> 02:41:12.829
KNOW THESE ARE LEGACY.

02:41:12.896 --> 02:41:13.897
INVESTMENTS THAT WE AS A FARMING

02:41:13.964 --> 02:41:15.298
COMMUNITY AND TO OUR TRACTOR

02:41:15.365 --> 02:41:16.366
EQUIPMENT AND ALL OF OUR

02:41:16.433 --> 02:41:17.501
EQUIPMENT- THEY'RE MEANT TO LAST

02:41:17.567 --> 02:41:19.169
A LONG TIME. AND SO GETTING THE

02:41:19.236 --> 02:41:21.905
SUPPORT FROM. THE GOVERNMENT TO

02:41:21.972 --> 02:41:23.874
BE ABLE TO SUBSIDIZE THE TO BE

02:41:23.940 --> 02:41:26.176
ABLE TO MIGRATE AWAY. FROM THE

02:41:26.243 --> 02:41:28.145
FOSSIL FUEL KIND OF. TRACTORS

02:41:28.211 --> 02:41:30.147
AND EQUIPMENT AND TO- CLEAN

02:41:30.213 --> 02:41:31.448
TECHNOLOGY I THINK WILL BE

02:41:31.515 --> 02:41:33.450
MASSIVELY SUPPORT OF- AND

02:41:33.517 --> 02:41:35.719
HELPFUL FOR US TO MAKE THIS

02:41:35.786 --> 02:41:37.921
HAPPEN. ABSOLUTELY FIVE. ON THE

02:41:37.988 --> 02:41:39.823
REGULATORY SIDE ARE WE WANT TO

02:41:39.890 --> 02:41:41.658
SPECIFICALLY HIGHLIGHT TITLE

02:41:41.725 --> 02:41:43.126
EIGHT SECTION THREE FOUR FOUR

02:41:43.193 --> 02:41:44.461
ONE B. WE SEE THIS AS THE

02:41:44.528 --> 02:41:46.863
PRIMARY REGULATORY ROADBLOCKS. I

02:41:46.930 --> 02:41:48.098
TO THE LARGER ADOPTION OF THIS

02:41:48.165 --> 02:41:50.967
TECHNOLOGY IN CALIFORNIA. R.

02:41:51.034 --> 02:41:52.436
THREE FOUR ONE ONE B. IS

02:41:52.502 --> 02:41:53.870
AMBIGUOUS TO AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS

02:41:53.937 --> 02:41:55.238
ARE IT IT DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR

02:41:55.305 --> 02:41:56.406
TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGICAL

02:41:56.473 --> 02:41:58.375
ADVANCES THAT HAVE HAPPENED OVER

02:41:58.442 --> 02:42:00.243
THE LAST FIFTY YEARS. OUR AND WE

02:42:00.310 --> 02:42:01.344
BELIEVE THAT CHANGE IS NEEDED TO

02:42:01.411 --> 02:42:06.183
THIS REGULATION AND IT'S. TIME

02:42:06.249 --> 02:42:08.085
SENSITIVE AS WELL. I THREE FOUR

02:42:08.151 --> 02:42:09.219
ONE FOUR. ONE B. R. THE STATE'S

02:42:09.286 --> 02:42:10.854
THAT ALL SELF. EQUIPMENT SHALL

02:42:10.921 --> 02:42:12.456
WIN UNDER ITS OWN POWER IN IN

02:42:12.522 --> 02:42:13.657
MOTION. HAVE AN OPERATOR

02:42:13.723 --> 02:42:15.025
STATIONED AT THE BEHEST OF OUR

02:42:15.092 --> 02:42:16.526
CONTROLS. ARE AND THIS CREATES A

02:42:16.593 --> 02:42:18.295
LOT OF AMBIGUITY IT'S UNCLEAR IF

02:42:18.361 --> 02:42:19.663
VEHICLES THAT ARE CONTROLLED.

02:42:19.729 --> 02:42:21.364
THROUGH AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS OR

02:42:21.431 --> 02:42:22.532
ARE CONTROLLED BY REMOTE

02:42:22.599 --> 02:42:24.634
OPERATOR. I NEED A STANDARD OR

02:42:24.701 --> 02:42:26.002
IF THE STANDARD IT HERE EVEN

02:42:26.069 --> 02:42:28.338
APPLIES TO. ARE THESE VEHICLES

02:42:28.405 --> 02:42:29.272
WHEN THEY'RE IN THE FIELD

02:42:29.339 --> 02:42:32.275
WITHOUT ANY SORT OF HUMAN BEINGS

02:42:32.342 --> 02:42:33.477
IN THE VICINITY. AND IS THIS

02:42:33.543 --> 02:42:35.245
DOES DIRECTLY AFFECT OUR OR SO

02:42:35.312 --> 02:42:37.380
MY LEVINE FOURMILE BY BEING ABLE

02:42:37.447 --> 02:42:38.381
TO HAVE A TANAMI WERE ABLE TO DO

02:42:38.448 --> 02:42:40.217
THE EXTRA PASSES TO GET INTO THE

02:42:40.283 --> 02:42:41.151
CLEAN AROUND THE FARMING WITHOUT

02:42:41.218 --> 02:42:42.352
THE CARBON FOOTPRINT MIGHT BE

02:42:42.419 --> 02:42:43.854
ELECTRIC. ANOTHER BIG THING IS

02:42:43.920 --> 02:42:46.156
ALSO- BY BEING ABLE TO HAVE AN

02:42:46.223 --> 02:42:47.991
OPERATOR ELEVATED INTO A MANAGER

02:42:48.058 --> 02:42:49.392
POSITION THAT IS AWAY FROM THE

02:42:49.459 --> 02:42:51.194
TRACTOR ACTUALLY PROTECTING THAT

02:42:51.261 --> 02:42:53.897
THE OPERATOR. I AND THE TEAMS SO

02:42:53.964 --> 02:42:55.198
IT'S SOMETHING THAT I FIND YOUR

02:42:55.265 --> 02:42:56.466
AND YOUR PROTECTING MY FAMILY'S

02:42:56.533 --> 02:42:58.869
FARM TEAM. AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW

02:42:58.935 --> 02:43:00.036
THE GREATER AGRICULTURAL

02:43:00.103 --> 02:43:01.204
COMMUNITY SO IT'S AN IMPORTANT

02:43:01.271 --> 02:43:03.006
THING THAT. WE KNOW I MEAN I'VE

02:43:03.073 --> 02:43:05.041
I'VE BEEN OUT OF TO OF WINERY

02:43:05.108 --> 02:43:08.011
AND FRANCE WHEN A TRACTOR ROLLED

02:43:08.078 --> 02:43:09.880
AND- AN OPERATOR WAS WAS

02:43:09.946 --> 02:43:10.947
TRAGICALLY KILLED SO THIS IS.

02:43:11.014 --> 02:43:12.849
NOT A SAFE PLACE TO BE SO HOW DO

02:43:12.916 --> 02:43:14.518
WE DO THAT SAFELY AND WE ARE ON

02:43:14.584 --> 02:43:16.319
PRIVATE PROPERTY- WHEN WE'RE

02:43:16.386 --> 02:43:17.854
LOOKING AT FARMING AGRICULTURAL

02:43:17.921 --> 02:43:18.955
LANDSCAPES THIS ISN'T A FREEWAY.

02:43:19.022 --> 02:43:20.924
OR OR THE CITY SO IT'S THAT IT'S

02:43:20.991 --> 02:43:22.225
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO REALLY

02:43:22.292 --> 02:43:23.660
CONSIDERED HOW CAN WE GET

02:43:23.727 --> 02:43:25.162
THROUGH THIS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE.

02:43:25.228 --> 02:43:26.930
THIS PROGRESS FOR OUR

02:43:26.997 --> 02:43:28.632
AGRICULTURAL. AND FOOD TO

02:43:28.698 --> 02:43:30.767
SPEAKER SYSTEMS YEAH I KNOW A

02:43:30.834 --> 02:43:31.368
COUPLE IMPORTANT POINTS THEIR

02:43:31.434 --> 02:43:33.003
CARLO AND- THE REGULATIONS

02:43:33.069 --> 02:43:34.404
WRITTEN BACK IN THE NINETEEN

02:43:34.471 --> 02:43:36.072
SEVENTIES ARE PRIMARILY AROUND

02:43:36.139 --> 02:43:37.607
THE ARAB WORLD ADEQUATE. WHICH

02:43:37.674 --> 02:43:40.210
IS ESSENTIALLY. THAT A ALONG

02:43:40.277 --> 02:43:42.879
DITCH I TO STEER EFFECTIVELY ARE

02:43:42.946 --> 02:43:44.247
HOWEVER SNAPPER. FARMERS FROM

02:43:44.314 --> 02:43:46.049
ATOP THE MODERN DAY CITY

02:43:46.116 --> 02:43:47.517
TECHNOLOGY ARE THAT PREVENTS

02:43:47.584 --> 02:43:48.885
TRACTOR ROLLOVERS CHEMICAL

02:43:48.952 --> 02:43:51.721
EXPOSURE. AND ALSO P. T. O. N.

02:43:51.788 --> 02:43:53.190
IN SOME OF THE DANGEROUS. PART

02:43:53.256 --> 02:43:55.992
OF OUR BEING ON. ARE AND THAT

02:43:56.059 --> 02:43:57.928
TECHNOLOGY IS A VERY MUCH TOP TO

02:43:57.994 --> 02:44:00.130
BE I'LL TALK. IN SERVICE THAT

02:44:00.197 --> 02:44:01.965
CAN VISIONS SORRY IT'S THE INTEL

02:44:02.032 --> 02:44:04.201
. OF THE PLATFORM IN THE MACHINE

02:44:04.267 --> 02:44:05.202
BEING ABLE TO HOUSE FULL CONTROL

02:44:05.268 --> 02:44:07.070
OF WHAT'S GOING ON THE MACHINE-

02:44:07.137 --> 02:44:08.972
SO IT IS VERY MUCH COUPLE TO-

02:44:09.039 --> 02:44:10.207
WHAT WE'RE DOING ON A LARGER

02:44:10.273 --> 02:44:12.375
SCALE HERE. ARE MOTOR TRACTOR-

02:44:12.442 --> 02:44:14.311
WE STARTED TO ENGAGE WITH CAL

02:44:14.377 --> 02:44:16.346
OSHA BACK IN THE END OF TWENTY

02:44:16.413 --> 02:44:17.113
NINETEEN ARE IN ORDER TO.

02:44:17.180 --> 02:44:18.882
EDUCATE THEM AND START TO THINK

02:44:18.949 --> 02:44:20.383
ABOUT HOW WE INTENTIONALLY

02:44:20.450 --> 02:44:21.952
DEPLOY THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND IN

02:44:22.018 --> 02:44:24.788
A SAFE WAY- WE'VE BEEN APPROVED

02:44:24.854 --> 02:44:26.189
NOW FOR A TEMPORARY EXPERIMENT

02:44:26.256 --> 02:44:28.124
VARIANTS TO DEPLOY. OUR THREE

02:44:28.191 --> 02:44:29.893
TRACTORS AT TWO DIFFERENT SITES

02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:36.933
IN CALIFORNIA- BUT IT'S ONLY.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:37.467
FOR A SINGLE CROP TYPE AND

02:44:37.534 --> 02:44:39.836
THERE'S A- YES. A LIMITATIONS

02:44:39.903 --> 02:44:41.838
ARE STUCK ON TOP OF THAT- THE

02:44:41.905 --> 02:44:43.607
CURRENT. A REGULAR AND- REQUIRE

02:44:43.673 --> 02:44:45.675
. A VERY TO BE A LOT OF. TO

02:44:45.742 --> 02:44:47.777
EVERY. FAR THAT WANTS TO. DEPLOY

02:44:47.844 --> 02:44:48.945
THIS KIND OF. ARE AGAIN BECAUSE

02:44:49.012 --> 02:44:50.580
OF THE AND- IN THE SYSTEM-

02:44:50.647 --> 02:44:52.082
HOWEVER THE TECH. IS HERE I WILL

02:44:52.148 --> 02:44:53.750
ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES. TO POINT

02:44:53.817 --> 02:44:56.386
A TECHNOLOGY CALIFORNIA- AND WE

02:44:56.453 --> 02:44:57.621
HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH

02:44:57.687 --> 02:44:59.856
CALIFORNIA TO CONTINUE- TO

02:44:59.923 --> 02:45:00.857
UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS

02:45:00.924 --> 02:45:06.396
WORK OUT AT A LARGER. THIS

02:45:06.463 --> 02:45:15.272
QUESTIONS. RIGHT RIGHT. AND IF

02:45:15.338 --> 02:45:16.906
LOVE THIS TECHNOLOGY- I'D LOVE

02:45:16.973 --> 02:45:19.309
TO SEE A WORKING LIKE TO SEE

02:45:19.376 --> 02:45:21.411
WHEN YOU'RE WHERE YOU HAVE IT-

02:45:21.478 --> 02:45:23.313
BECAUSE LOOK AT THIS IS GREAT

02:45:23.380 --> 02:45:25.582
FOR START SO NOT GOING TO BE

02:45:25.649 --> 02:45:29.853
CRITICAL MISSING IN A GREAT.

02:45:29.919 --> 02:45:33.757
GRAPE ORCHARD GOING FROM BY A

02:45:33.823 --> 02:45:41.164
BIGGER. THANK THAT THEY WOULD BE

02:45:41.231 --> 02:45:43.033
- AND SO THAT MAKES WILL BE THAN

02:45:43.099 --> 02:45:47.137
SOME OTHER USES WHAT'S- HOURS

02:45:47.203 --> 02:45:49.139
FOR USE ON A CHARGE ON A TRACTOR

02:45:49.205 --> 02:45:50.240
YES SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT A TEN

02:45:50.307 --> 02:45:52.275
HOURS OF TIME I REALLY DEPENDS A

02:45:52.342 --> 02:45:54.010
LOT ON THE TO DOING SOMETHING

02:45:54.077 --> 02:45:54.911
THAT'S GROUNDING IT'S GOING TO

02:45:54.978 --> 02:45:57.080
BE CLOSER FOUR OR FIVE HOURS IF

02:45:57.147 --> 02:45:58.181
IT JUST AROUND IN COLLECTING

02:45:58.248 --> 02:45:59.816
WITH THE SAN. ARE YOU LOOKING

02:45:59.883 --> 02:46:01.318
TWENTY HOURS OF RUNTIME ARE THE

02:46:01.384 --> 02:46:03.286
CHORE TIME FOR SINGLE BAD ARE IS

02:46:03.353 --> 02:46:05.155
ANY FROM FOUR TO FIVE HOUR-

02:46:05.221 --> 02:46:08.158
AGAIN THERE'S ARE COMPLEX AROUND

02:46:08.224 --> 02:46:09.459
WHAT THEY'RE WHAT GOING TO TRIP

02:46:09.526 --> 02:46:10.360
LOOKS LIKE A THE FARM THINGS OF

02:46:10.427 --> 02:46:12.495
THAT. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE SOME

02:46:12.562 --> 02:46:14.764
BATTERY SYSTEM SO I DOES I

02:46:14.831 --> 02:46:17.367
WRITTEN. RUN MARK STONE TEN

02:46:17.434 --> 02:46:19.703
MINUTES BETWEEN THE YEAH HOLD ON

02:46:19.769 --> 02:46:22.405
JUST SAY MY GUY I TALKED YARD WE

02:46:22.472 --> 02:46:24.107
ALREADY HAVE ALL THE ELECTRICAL

02:46:24.174 --> 02:46:26.943
THERE WE THIS WAS WE NEED. SO

02:46:27.010 --> 02:46:29.045
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE- KIND A

02:46:29.112 --> 02:46:30.647
STRUCTURE WE EASILY TRACK IN

02:46:30.714 --> 02:46:33.316
THAT FOUR TO FIVE HOUR TIME

02:46:33.383 --> 02:46:34.584
PERIOD ALSO THE BASED ON A ZERO

02:46:34.651 --> 02:46:36.419
TO FULL WELL ALMOST NEVER TO TRY

02:46:36.486 --> 02:46:39.723
TO THE ARTS ZERO BE LIKE 10% YOU

02:46:39.789 --> 02:46:43.193
KNOW BY PER OF RIGHT DOWN YEAH.

02:46:43.259 --> 02:46:44.828
YEAH WHAT'S A GOOD IT'S ABOUT

02:46:44.894 --> 02:46:47.664
FOR- YOU PEOPLE TO GET A BECAUSE

02:46:47.731 --> 02:46:49.466
AS WE STILL LIVE IN THE

02:46:49.532 --> 02:46:50.266
WINTERTIME WE'RE USUALLY WORKING

02:46:50.333 --> 02:46:54.437
ON OUR BOB BARR TRACKED IN OUR-

02:46:54.504 --> 02:46:56.439
OUR QUICK MAY ENOUGH AND FIX

02:46:56.506 --> 02:46:59.843
THEM. BUT THE SAME STUFF THAT

02:46:59.909 --> 02:47:02.746
DOESN'T NOW YEAH SYSTEM WOULD DO

02:47:02.812 --> 02:47:19.662
THIS. ONE NO QUESTIONS- YEAH I

02:47:19.729 --> 02:47:22.532
MEAN JUST JUST ECHOING WITH THE

02:47:22.599 --> 02:47:24.734
MEMBER JUST MENTIONED. IT WAS

02:47:24.801 --> 02:47:26.703
MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT NEVER

02:47:26.770 --> 02:47:28.138
GONNA NEED MORE TEACHERS MORE

02:55:04.827 --> 02:55:06.863
LOW PAY ON HARD WORK WAS ALSO

02:55:06.929 --> 02:55:08.130
REFLECTED IN THE PROCESSING

02:55:08.197 --> 02:55:10.032
FACILITIES IN THE PAST AND THAT

02:55:10.099 --> 02:55:12.668
IS CHANGING. ALONG WITH THE

02:55:12.735 --> 02:55:13.970
CHALLENGES OF THE AGING

02:55:14.036 --> 02:55:16.038
WORKFORCE AND THE LACK OF STAFF

02:55:16.105 --> 02:55:17.640
HAS ACCELERATED THIS PROCESS IN

02:55:17.707 --> 02:55:20.910
RECENT TIMES NO I DID PROVIDE-

02:55:20.977 --> 02:55:23.246
SOME SLIDES FOR YOU AND I WON'T

02:55:23.312 --> 02:55:24.513
GO THROUGH EACH ONE OF THEM BUT

02:55:24.580 --> 02:55:25.982
I DID WANT TO MAKE COMMENTS ON A

02:55:26.048 --> 02:55:28.184
FEW OF THEM THE FIRST FLIGHT IS

02:55:28.251 --> 02:55:29.752
OUR HIGH PRESSURE STEAM BOILER

02:55:29.819 --> 02:55:31.187
WE PUT THAT IN OUR WOODLAND

02:55:31.254 --> 02:55:33.856
PLANT- TWO YEARS AGO. AND THAT'S

02:55:33.923 --> 02:55:35.625
PROBABLY THE MOST STATE OF THE

02:55:35.691 --> 02:55:37.126
ART BOILER IN THE STATE OF

02:55:37.193 --> 02:55:39.996
CALIFORNIA IT'S- VERY ENERGY

02:55:40.062 --> 02:55:42.031
EFFICIENT AND THE PROTECT THE

02:55:42.098 --> 02:55:43.766
PEOPLE WHO OPERATE THOSE BOILERS

02:55:43.833 --> 02:55:46.302
ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE MORE HMI

02:55:46.369 --> 02:55:48.070
HUMAN MACHINE INTERFACE WORKING

02:55:48.137 --> 02:55:49.739
WITH SCREENS WORKING WITH DATA

02:55:49.805 --> 02:55:51.407
THE AIR QUALITY REGULATIONS OF

02:55:51.474 --> 02:55:53.142
COURSE BECOME MORE DETAILED AND

02:55:53.209 --> 02:55:56.279
SO WE NEED TO EDUCATE OUR BOILER

02:55:56.345 --> 02:55:57.780
OPERATORS TO BE MORE

02:55:57.847 --> 02:56:00.349
SOPHISTICATED- THE NEXT SLIDE IS

02:56:00.416 --> 02:56:02.585
THE OPTICAL SORTING TECHNOLOGY.

02:56:02.652 --> 02:56:04.186
SO IN THE PAST THIS WOULD HAVE

02:56:04.253 --> 02:56:06.222
BEEN A BELT WITH PEOPLE ALONG

02:56:06.289 --> 02:56:08.257
SIDE THE BUILT RESORT MANUALLY

02:56:08.324 --> 02:56:10.693
SORTING THANK YOU AWESOME AND IF

02:56:10.760 --> 02:56:11.794
YOU LOOK AT THE NEXT PAGE IT

02:56:11.861 --> 02:56:14.764
SHOWS YOU WITH THE- PROGRESSION

02:56:14.830 --> 02:56:16.465
OF THE TECHNOLOGY WHERE THE

02:56:16.532 --> 02:56:18.301
CAMERAS CAN SEE AS WELL AS THE

02:56:18.367 --> 02:56:21.037
HUMAN EYE AND THOUGH FRUITS GOES

02:56:21.103 --> 02:56:22.438
THROUGH THE MACHINES VERY

02:56:22.505 --> 02:56:24.340
QUICKLY ON THEM THE MACHINE

02:56:24.407 --> 02:56:26.642
IDENTIFIES A BLEMISHED FRUIT

02:56:26.709 --> 02:56:29.312
AND- PUFFS AIR. THAT THE FRUIT

02:56:29.378 --> 02:56:31.280
TO KNOCK IT DOWN BELOW THE BELT

02:56:31.347 --> 02:56:32.315
THAT'S GOING ON INTO THE

02:56:32.381 --> 02:56:34.016
PROCESSING IT'S REALLY A QUITE

02:56:34.083 --> 02:56:37.420
INTERESTING. AND FASCINATING

02:56:37.486 --> 02:56:38.254
TECHNOLOGY- THE NEXT PAGE THAT

02:56:38.321 --> 02:56:41.490
SEE ON THE AUTOMATED TOMATO FLOW

02:56:41.557 --> 02:56:43.292
. THERE'S GENERALLY PEOPLE

02:56:43.359 --> 02:56:44.961
OPERATING ALL OF THESE POINTS

02:56:45.027 --> 02:56:47.063
OF- TRANSFERENCE WHERE THE

02:56:47.129 --> 02:56:49.165
TOMATOES COME INTO THE PLANTS

02:56:49.231 --> 02:56:50.967
ARE TRANSFERRED BY FLAMES AND

02:56:51.033 --> 02:56:52.034
RINSED AND GO UP THE ELEVATORS

02:56:52.101 --> 02:56:53.936
INTO THE PLANTS THIS WILL ALL BE

02:56:54.003 --> 02:56:56.038
AUTOMATED AND SO. HAS SOME OF

02:56:56.105 --> 02:56:57.039
THE DISCUSSION YOU'VE HEARD

02:56:57.106 --> 02:56:59.108
BEFORE ABOUT THE AUTO REMOTE

02:56:59.175 --> 02:57:01.243
OPERATING GATES AND REMOTE

02:57:01.310 --> 02:57:03.079
MONITORING OF QUALITY AND THINGS

02:57:03.145 --> 02:57:04.547
LIKE THAT IS WHERE WE'RE HEADED

02:57:04.613 --> 02:57:06.248
WITH OUR PLANTS AS WELL. THE

02:57:06.315 --> 02:57:07.883
NEXT PICTURE THE PL SEASON

02:57:07.950 --> 02:57:09.719
OUTPUT DISPLAYS IS JUST TO SHOW

02:57:09.785 --> 02:57:12.521
YOU WHAT THE THIS CHANGES IN OUR

02:57:12.588 --> 02:57:14.056
PLANTS WE HAVE NOW YOU KNOW

02:57:14.123 --> 02:57:16.058
HIGHLY AUTOMATED DIGITAL READ

02:57:16.125 --> 02:57:18.127
OUT SO THAT. ULTIMATELY WE WOULD

02:57:18.194 --> 02:57:23.032
LIKE TO GET TO A LIVE REAL TIME-

02:57:23.099 --> 02:57:25.201
READ OF THE PRODUCT GOING

02:57:25.267 --> 02:57:26.902
THROUGH OUR PLANS AT THE MOMENT

02:57:26.969 --> 02:57:28.304
SO THAT YOU CAN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS

02:57:28.371 --> 02:57:29.972
BASED ON THE QUALITY OF THE

02:57:30.039 --> 02:57:32.041
PRODUCT AT THE TIME SO THAT WILL

02:57:32.108 --> 02:57:32.742
MAKE US MORE EFFICIENT AND

02:57:32.808 --> 02:57:35.077
AGAIN. IT JUST INCREASES THE

02:57:35.144 --> 02:57:37.847
NEED FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN WORK

02:57:37.913 --> 02:57:38.280
WITH THESE TYPES OF

02:57:38.347 --> 02:57:42.084
TECHNOLOGIES- THERE'S MORE

02:57:42.151 --> 02:57:43.586
SLIDES ABOUT OUR OUR CASE

02:57:43.652 --> 02:57:45.921
STACKING ROBOTICS WHICH MAKES

02:57:45.988 --> 02:57:48.057
THE WORK LESS MANUAL FOR PEOPLE

02:57:48.124 --> 02:57:48.958
WHICH IS A GOOD THING IT'S HARD

02:57:49.025 --> 02:57:51.994
WORK. OR PALLETIZER AUTOMATION.

02:57:52.061 --> 02:57:53.896
AND OUR CANS STACKING ALL OF

02:57:53.963 --> 02:57:58.134
THESE- REQUIRE. PEOPLE WHO CAN

02:57:58.200 --> 02:57:59.668
SERVICE THESE MACHINES SO WHEN

02:57:59.735 --> 02:58:01.003
YOU EARLIER ASKED ABOUT

02:58:01.070 --> 02:58:03.005
TECHNOLOGY ELIMINATING SOME JOBS

02:58:03.072 --> 02:58:04.273
I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW THEY

02:58:04.340 --> 02:58:05.808
PROBABLY WILL ELIMINATE SOME

02:58:05.875 --> 02:58:07.643
JOBS IT'LL ELIMINATE MAYBE THOSE

02:58:07.710 --> 02:58:09.245
SORTING JOBS OR THE SANITATION

02:58:09.311 --> 02:58:11.113
JOBS WHERE YOU'RE THERE WITH THE

02:58:11.180 --> 02:58:12.648
HIGH PRESSURE WAND. CLEANING

02:58:12.715 --> 02:58:14.650
EQUIPMENT BUT WHAT IT WILL

02:58:14.717 --> 02:58:15.985
CHANGE THAT TO IS YOU NEED THE

02:58:16.052 --> 02:58:17.853
PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN THE EQUIPMENT

02:58:17.920 --> 02:58:19.188
YOU NEED PEOPLE TO PROGRAM THE

02:58:19.255 --> 02:58:22.091
CONTROLS TO READ THE CONTROLS TO

02:58:22.158 --> 02:58:23.926
MAKE UP THE APPROPRIATE

02:58:23.993 --> 02:58:25.361
DECISIONS OFF OF THE DATA THAT

02:58:25.428 --> 02:58:28.464
THEY GET FROM THAT TECHNOLOGY IN

02:58:28.531 --> 02:58:30.299
ORDER TO RUN THE OPERATIONS. SO

02:58:30.366 --> 02:58:32.568
CAN I JUST INTERRUPT YOU YES OF

02:58:32.635 --> 02:58:34.103
COURSE I MEAN. IT WILL HOW DO

02:58:34.170 --> 02:58:36.272
YOU RECRUIT WE'RE WORRIED

02:58:36.338 --> 02:58:36.839
GETTING YOUR LABOR FORCE FOR

02:58:36.906 --> 02:58:42.011
THIS. SO CURRENTLY WE HAVE IT'S

02:58:42.078 --> 02:58:43.446
A CHALLENGE SO WE HAVE A VARIETY

02:58:43.512 --> 02:58:46.949
OF WAYS OF RECRUITING WE-

02:58:47.016 --> 02:58:52.421
pOF OUT OF STATE- ENTITIES

02:58:52.488 --> 02:58:53.722
THERE'S A PERRY TECHNICAL

02:58:53.789 --> 02:58:55.891
INSTITUTE UP IN YAKIMA

02:58:55.958 --> 02:58:57.993
WASHINGTON THAT HAS A- STE-

02:58:58.060 --> 02:58:59.995
INSTITUTE THAT SPECIFICALLY

02:59:00.062 --> 02:59:01.964
TARGETED TOWARDS CONTROLS TAX AN

02:59:02.031 --> 02:59:03.933
INSTRUMENT TAX. AND YOU GO TO

02:59:03.999 --> 02:59:04.900
THEIR JOB FAIRS AND THERE'S

02:59:04.967 --> 02:59:07.002
ACTUALLY NATIONAL EMPLOYERS THEY

02:59:07.069 --> 02:59:07.903
ARE LOOKING FOR THE SAME THING

02:59:07.970 --> 02:59:09.672
THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR I WAS

02:59:09.738 --> 02:59:11.407
VERY ENCOURAGED TODAY TO HEAR

02:59:11.474 --> 02:59:12.274
THE GENTLEMAN FROM HARTNELL

02:59:12.341 --> 02:59:15.044
COLLEGE AND- MAYBE TALKING TO

02:59:15.111 --> 02:59:16.512
HIM AFTERWARDS BECAUSE I WAS

02:59:16.579 --> 02:59:18.380
VERY INTERESTED IN HIS PROGRAM.

02:59:18.447 --> 02:59:20.816
AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE

02:59:20.883 --> 02:59:24.019
STATE HELPS SUPPORT THE EXPORT

02:59:24.086 --> 02:59:25.221
OF THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS TO

02:59:25.287 --> 02:59:26.922
OTHER COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE

02:59:26.989 --> 02:59:30.059
I THINK IT'S TRUE THAT PEOPLE IN

02:59:30.126 --> 02:59:32.294
OUR INDUSTRY LIKE TO STAY WHERE

02:59:32.361 --> 02:59:34.630
THEY ARE AND SO WE NEED TO GET

02:59:34.697 --> 02:59:36.365
THE EDUCATION TO THEM SO THAT

02:59:36.432 --> 02:59:37.833
THEY KNOW THAT THERE'S GOOD JOBS

02:59:37.900 --> 02:59:39.902
IN THEIR COMMUNITY. THAT THEY

02:59:39.969 --> 02:59:42.004
CAN HAVE- YOU KNOW WELL PAYING

02:59:42.071 --> 02:59:43.239
JOBS WITH BENEFITS THAT THEY CAN

02:59:43.305 --> 02:59:44.907
SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY ON AND THEY

02:59:44.974 --> 02:59:46.876
CAN STAY WHERE THEY ARE SO YOU

02:59:46.942 --> 02:59:48.944
KNOW I THINK THAT'S- THAT'S VERY

02:59:49.011 --> 02:59:51.280
HELPFUL WE ALSO YOU KNOW DO WHAT

02:59:51.347 --> 02:59:53.082
EVERYBODY ELSE DOES AND PUT JOBS

ON INDEED AND MONSTER AND ALL

02:59:54.950 --> 02:59:58.988
THOSE SORTS OF THINGS- SO- IT.

02:59:59.054 --> 03:00:01.090
IT'S A CHALLENGE IT'S A

03:00:01.157 --> 03:00:02.458
CHALLENGE TO RECRUIT. THANK YOU

03:00:02.525 --> 03:00:03.792
FOR THESE TYPES OF AND AGAIN I

03:00:03.859 --> 03:00:05.861
THINK IT'S BEEN SAID EARLIER AG.

03:00:05.928 --> 03:00:07.730
AND FOOD PROCESSING IS NOT

03:00:07.796 --> 03:00:11.133
NECESSARILY A DESIRED CAREER-

03:00:11.200 --> 03:00:12.201
PEOPLE WANT TO GO WORK FOR

03:00:12.268 --> 03:00:13.435
GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK AND THINGS

03:00:13.502 --> 03:00:15.137
LIKE THAT SO WE NEED TO MAKE

03:00:15.204 --> 03:00:18.474
OUR- JOB OPPORTUNITIES. MORE

03:00:18.541 --> 03:00:20.009
MARKETED TO PEOPLE SO THAT THEY

03:00:20.075 --> 03:00:21.343
UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME GOOD

03:00:21.410 --> 03:00:23.546
OPPORTUNITIES. AND WE DO A GOOD

03:00:23.612 --> 03:00:25.781
THING WE FEED THE NATION WE FEED

03:00:25.848 --> 03:00:28.017
THE WORLD IT'S NOT- IT'S NOT A

03:00:28.083 --> 03:00:29.485
NEGATIVE TO BE IN THE FOOD

03:00:29.552 --> 03:00:34.290
PROCESSING INDUSTRY- SO AS FAR

03:00:34.356 --> 03:00:37.026
AS YOU KNOW LOOKING FORWARD. AS

03:00:37.092 --> 03:00:37.860
TO WHAT TO DO NOW WE'VE

03:00:37.927 --> 03:00:39.195
PARTICIPATED IN SOME LOCAL

03:00:39.261 --> 03:00:41.197
PROGRAMS ARE LOCAL CHAMBER OF

03:00:41.263 --> 03:00:43.165
COMMERCE HAD A PROGRAM WHERE WE

03:00:43.232 --> 03:00:45.034
TRIED TO GET OUR MECHANICS AND

03:00:45.100 --> 03:00:46.669
OUR ELECTRICIANS TO GO TO THE

03:00:46.735 --> 03:00:48.704
SCHOOLS TO THE HIGH SCHOOLS AND

03:00:48.771 --> 03:00:50.339
TALK TO THE- STUDENTS THERE

03:00:50.406 --> 03:00:52.141
ABOUT HEY YOU KNOW YOU CAN GO TO

03:00:52.208 --> 03:00:53.475
A COMMUNITY COLLEGE GET AN

03:00:53.542 --> 03:00:54.877
EDUCATION AND HAVE A GOOD JOB

03:00:54.944 --> 03:00:57.213
HERE. AND THAT'S- BEEN SOMEWHAT

03:00:57.279 --> 03:00:58.347
SUCCESSFUL BUT AGAIN IT'S A

03:00:58.414 --> 03:01:00.382
QUESTION OF SCALE- AND IT'S A

03:01:00.449 --> 03:01:02.084
QUESTION OF RESOURCES TO DO

03:01:02.151 --> 03:01:04.753
THAT- THE LITTLE HOOVER

03:01:04.820 --> 03:01:06.722
COMMISSION WELL I'M- SURE YOU

03:01:06.789 --> 03:01:07.990
PROBABLY ARE WELL FAMILIAR WITH

03:01:08.057 --> 03:01:11.060
DID A REPORT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

03:01:11.126 --> 03:01:13.462
TALKING ABOUT- THE AUTOMATED

03:01:13.529 --> 03:01:15.431
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ITS

03:01:15.497 --> 03:01:17.299
IMPACT ON THE WORK FORCE. AND IN

03:01:17.366 --> 03:01:19.435
THAT REPORT THEY READ MADE

03:01:19.501 --> 03:01:21.270
SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND A

03:01:21.337 --> 03:01:23.272
COUPLE I FELT WERE RELEVANT TO

03:01:23.339 --> 03:01:25.374
THE ISSUE TODAY AND ONE OF THOSE

03:01:25.441 --> 03:01:27.243
WAS THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD

03:01:27.309 --> 03:01:29.278
IMPLEMENT CHANGES TO IMPROVE ITS

03:01:29.345 --> 03:01:31.213
DATA COLLECTION ON JOBS AND

03:01:31.280 --> 03:01:33.349
SKILLS FOR FUTURE WORKERS SO

03:01:33.415 --> 03:01:35.384
THAT A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF

03:01:35.451 --> 03:01:36.218
WORKFORCE AND EMPLOYMENT NEEDS

03:01:36.285 --> 03:01:38.954
TRANSISTORIZED AND PLANNING. FOR

03:01:39.021 --> 03:01:40.189
EXAMPLE THE HOOVER COMMISSION

03:01:40.256 --> 03:01:41.757
REFERRED TO THE CALIFORNIA

03:01:41.824 --> 03:01:43.092
COMMUNITY COLLEGE CENTERS OF

03:01:43.158 --> 03:01:45.227
EXCELLENCE FOR LABOR MARKET

03:01:45.294 --> 03:01:46.829
RESEARCH THE CENTER OF

03:01:46.895 --> 03:01:48.130
EXCELLENCE CONDUCTS SPECIAL

03:01:48.197 --> 03:01:49.698
PROJECTS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND

03:01:49.765 --> 03:01:51.367
THE NEEDS OF THE WORKFORCE IN

03:01:51.433 --> 03:01:53.168
EVOLVING AND EMERGING INDUSTRIES

03:01:53.235 --> 03:01:54.303
BY CONDUCTING POINT IN TIME

03:01:54.370 --> 03:01:56.405
SURVEYS AND TALKING TO EMPLOYERS

03:01:56.472 --> 03:01:58.073
AND CONTROLLED WAYS THE CENTER

03:01:58.140 --> 03:01:59.942

TIME INFORMATION ON JOB TRENDS.

03:02:01.844 --> 03:02:03.812
SO THAT WOULD BE AN EXISTING

03:02:03.879 --> 03:02:06.415
RESOURCE THAT COULD BE UTILIZED

03:02:06.482 --> 03:02:08.617
TO HELP PLAN FOR HOW TO HOW TO
