WHERE MATING FOR MEMBERS TO COUNSEL AND START WITH A SUBCOMMITTEE GOOD MORNING GREAT WE CAN NOW BEGIN AS A? SUBCOMMITTEE. ITEM. OF WHICH MISTER CHAU. ITEM NUMBER THREE AB TWENTY TEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. I LIKE TO START BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS ARE LISTED ON PAGE SIX OF THE ANALYSIS. THE AMENDMENTS WOULD PROVIDE A TO YOUR FACE AND PERIOD BEFORE TAKING EFFECT. IN ORDER TO GIVE COUNTY PROBATION AND CDC OUR TIME TO PROVIDE TRAINING ON DE ESCALATION AND CRISIS INTERVENTION TECHNIQUES FOR THEIR OFFICERS. THIS BILL AB TWENTY TEN WOULD LIMIT THE USE OF CHEMICAL SPRAY IN JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES AND REQUIRED THAT ALL SITUATIONS. INVOLVING ITS USE BE FULLY DOCUMENTED. CALIFORNIA LAW SPECIFICALLY WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION EIGHT FIFTY ONE PROVIDES AT JUVENILE HALL SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE NO WOULD BE TREATED AS. A PENAL INSTITUTION. IT SHALL BE A SAFE AND SUPPORTIVE HOME LIKE ENVIRONMENT. ADDITIONALLY EXISTING LAW ALSO PROVIDES THAT MINERS IN CUSTODY SHOULD RECEIVE CARE TREATMENT AND GUIDANCE CONSISTENT WITH THEIR BEST INTERESTS. THE USE OF CHEMICAL SPRAYS IN JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES IS BECOMING A RARE OCCURRENCE NATIONALLY. THE MOST RECENTLY AVAILABLE STATISTICS PROVIDE THAT CALIFORNIA IS ONLY ONE OF SIX SPEAKS. IN THE ENTIRE NATION THAT ALLOW OFFICERS TO CARRY AND USE CHEMICAL SPRAY ON CHILDREN IN DETENTION FACILITIES. THE THREAT OR USE OF CHEMICAL AGENTS INCLUDING PEPPER SPRAY. CANS SUBJECT YOU'VE TO PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL PAIN. IT ALSO CREATES A CHALLENGE FOR THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM SU REHABILITATE OF A MISSION. STUDIES ALSO INDICATE THAT INDIVIDUALS WOULD. COMPROMISE OUR RESPIRATORY SYSTEMS SUCH AS THOSE SUFFERING FROM ASTHMA OR BRONCHITIS MAYBE AT PARTICULAR RISK FOR RESPIRATORY ARREST RESULTING FROM CHEMICAL SPRAY. EXPOSURE. FURTHERMORE CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO CHEMICAL SPRAY MAY RESULT IN CHRONIC RESPIRATORY AILMENTS. THESE RISKS MAY BE EXACERBATED BY MENTAL ILLNESS INSUFFICIENT AIR CIRCULATION AND REPEATED EXPOSURE. ALL CONDITIONS THAT MOST LIKELY EXIST IN JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES. ADDITIONALLY THE USE OF CHEMICAL AGENTS INTERFERE WITH OF THE REHABILITATION BECAUSE. IT AFFECTS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND STAFF. A SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE COUNCIL OF JUVENILE CORRECTIONAL ADMINISTRATORS IN TWENTY ELEVEN DEMONSTRATED THAT WORK CHEMICAL SPRAY IS USED. STAFF AND YOU FEAR FOR THEIR SAFETY MORE THAN AVERAGE. AND THAT STATES AUTHORIZING THE USE OF CHEMICAL RESTRAINTS ALSO TEND TO HAVE ADOPTED A MORE PUNITIVE. ADULT CORRECTIONS LIKE APPROACH TO JUVENILE DETENTION. THIS BILL AB TWENTY TEN THIS AMENDED WOULD PROHIBIT STAFF IN JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES FROM HAVING CHEMICALS RATE IN THEIR POSSESSION. STARTING IN THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. HOWEVER IT WOULD PROVIDE EXCEPTIONS FOR STAFF TO OBTAIN AND USE CHEMICAL SPRAY IN ORDER TO SUPPRESS THE RIOT. OR IN SITUATIONS WHERE DE ESCALATION TACTICS OF FAILED OR ARE NOT NEW REASONABLY POSSIBLE. ADDITIONALLY AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED TO INSURE THAT OFFICERS HAVE A TWO YEAR PERIOD. IN WHICH STATE AND COUNTY OFFICERS WILL BE TRAINED IN DE ESCALATION AND CRISIS INTERVENTION TECHNIQUES. FINALLY THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THAT ALL SITUATIONS INVOLVING THE USE OF CHEMICAL SPRAY BE DOCUMENTED AND INCLUDE INFORMATION RELATED TO THE USE. OF THE REASONABLE USE THE AUTHOR IS IT AUTHORIZATION DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURES AS WELL AS FOLLOW UP. VISITS WITH MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS WITH ME TODAY I HAVE TWO WITNESSES SO ABA JUNIOR CARDIGANS OF THE WILL YOU'VE LAW CENTER AND ALSO AGAR IBARRA OF THE MILL PA COLLECTIVE. THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS VIRGINIA COREGONUS STAFF ATTORNEY WITH THESE LAW CENTER AND I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR HIS SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT BELL. ON AND THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALSO TOUCHED ON THE REASONS WHY THIS BILL IS SO IMPORTANT. CHEMICAL AGENTS WE KNOW ARE HARMFUL FOR CHILDREN BOTH PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY THERE ESPECIALLY HARMFUL FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED TRAUMA. WHICH IS VIRTUALLY EVERY IF NOT EVERY YOUNG PERSON AREN'T IN OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. CHEMICAL AGENTS ARE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IN THEIR ANTI REHABILITATIVE. THE GOAL OF CALIFORNIA'S JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS REHABILITATION AND SECURE JUVENILE FACILITIES ARE TASKED WITH PROVIDING A SAFE AND SUPPORTIVE HOME LIKE ENVIRONMENT. FUN AND PROVIDING EFFECTIVE REHABILITATION WE KNOW. IT SUPPORTS PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE ABLE TO DEVELOP TRUSTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH STAFF ARE ABLE TO DEVELOP THOSE SKILLS THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO. BECOME PRODUCTIVE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. ON. BUT THOSE RELATIONSHIPS ARE DAMAGED AND TRUST IS IMPOSSIBLE WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE KNOW THAT THEY ARE CONSTANTLY THREATENED WITH THE USE OF DANGEROUS AND HARMFUL CHEMICAL AGENTS. LET ALONE THEIR ACTUAL USE ON THEM. I'M MORE WHAT I WANNA SPEAK MOST ABOUT IS IS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE FACT THAT CHEMICAL AGENTS ARE NOT NECESSARY TO RUN EFFECTIVE AND SAFE JUVENILE FACILITIES. AND AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TOUCHED ON OUR MOST RECENT DATA SHOWS THAT ONLY SIX STATE RUN JUVENILE INSTITUTIONS JUVENILE CORRECTIONAL SYSTEMS USE ON CHEMICAL AGENTS. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THEM. OTHER STATES HAVE ELIMINATED THE USE OF CHEMICAL AGENTS IT SAFELY AND SUCCESSFULLY TO NAME JUST A FEW EXAMPLES. OKLAHOMA HAS BANNED THE USE OF CHEMICAL SPRAYS AND ALL OF ITS JUVENILE FACILITIES. SINCE THE BAN ONE YEAR AGO THEY'VE HAD NO INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ASSAULTS OR INJURIES EITHER TO YOUNG PEOPLE OR TO STAFF. THE BAND INCLUDES THE FACILITY HOUSING THE YOUTH WHO HAVE COMMITTED THE MOST SERIOUS DEFENSES IN OKLAHOMA INCLUDING MURDER AND RAPE. ON AND ONCE AGAIN THEY ARE NO LONGER USING CHEMICAL AGENTS AND THEY'RE RUNNING THE FACILITY SAFELY. STAFF INCLUDING FEMALE STAFF ARE STILL ABLE TOSECURE THOSE FACILITIES WITHOUT THE USE OF SPRAY. OHIO NEW YORK IN LOUISIANA HAVE ALSO RECENTLY UNLIMITED ELIMINATED THE USE OF CHEMICAL AGENTS AND TEXAS LIMITS THE USE OF CHEMICAL AGENTS. I'M SIMILAR TO SIMILAR TO HOW THIS BILL WOULD LIMIT IT. ON. BASICALLY ONLY IN RIOT SITUATIONS IN WITH THE APPROVAL OF ADMINISTRATORS AND CALIFORNIA'S PROBATION OFFICERS AND COUNSELORS INCLUDING OUR FEMALE PROBATION OFFICERS AND COUNSELORS ARE JUST AS COMPETENT. AND JUST IS ABLE TO MAINTAIN FACILITY SAFELY AS THOSE OFFICERS AND COUNSELORS AND OTHER STATES. WE KNOW OTHER INTERVENTIONS CAN BE YOU SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY. ON IN OKLAHOMA JUVENILE FAT FACILITIES STAFF ARE EMPOWERED TO HANDLE THINGS DIFFERENTLY AND NO ONE HAS ASKED TO BRING SPRAY BACK INSTEAD STAFFER BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH YOUNG PEOPLE WORKING WITH YOUNG PEOPLE BEFORE THEY GET TO THE BLOW UP STAGE. HELPING THEM THINK BEFORE THEY ACT AND ENCOURAGING THEM TO ASK FOR HELP WHEN THEY NEED IT. THIS BILL IS A SENSIBLE SOLUTION THAT MOVES CALIFORNIA IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TOWARDS THE USE OF BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS AND SUPERVISION MODELS THAT WILL OBVIATE THE NEED FOR CHEMICAL AGENTS. THE TWO YEAR TRANSITION PLAN WILL ALLOW OUR PROBATION OFFICERS YES TICKET. TO BE TRAINED IN THESE ALTERNATIVE METHODS FOR SAY FACILITY MANAGEMENT THANK FUTURE NEVER GOT STATES TWO MINUTES INTO AND YOU WILL OVER THOUGHT I HAVE. A GIVE YEAR TO. HELLO GOOD MORNING WHIMS EDU BAHRAM WITH MEAT BY AND OF SALINAS IN NAM. I DO WANNA THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND ALL THOSE WHO ON. PUT INPUT AND MAKING THIS BILL PUT IT OUT THERE AND JUST WANTED TO SHARE SOME EXPERIENCES OF BEING ACTUALLY. SPRAYED WITH MULTIPLE AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF OF CHEMICAL AGENTS SPRAYS. WHILE I WAS INCARCERATED AS JUVENILE IN THAT DJJ AND OTHER FACILITIES AS WELL AS JUST THE. FIRST EVERYBODY HAVE THIS MISCONCEPTION THAT. YOU GET SPRAYED AND YOU GO THROUGH A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT IN YOUR FACING YOUR GOOD. YOU DON'T YOU DON'T BURN NO MORE YOU KNOW YOU GET A DECONTAMINATION WELL AS ONE X. SAY THAT NO. THAT'S NOT TRUE IT TAKES WEEKS. SOMETIMES DEPENDING ON WHAT KIND OF SPRAY THE SPREE WITH. AND THEY SPRAY WITH THIS THE HEADLESS AND THE INTRODUCED EXCUSE BY WHILE I WAS THERE IT'S LIKE A A GOOD LIKE SUBSTANCES STICKS TO YOU. IS SITES NOW LIQUID. IT'S NOT. JUST A SPRAY KNOWS GOO. AND THAT MY PERSONAL REACTION MY BODY PERSONAL REACTION TO IT WAS. I HAD BLISTERS AYE BOILED. AYE GOT BOILS AND MY SKIN PEELED. AND THIS IS NOT JUST A DAY OR TWO LATER BECAUSE OF THE PROLONGED. PROCESS FOR ALMOST A MONTH AND I WENT TO THE NURSE THE NURSES SEEN THIS IS DOCUMENTED IN THEIR THE NURSES SEEMINGLY TREATED ME FOR ALL THIS TYPE OF. OUR SIDE EFFECTS FROM THIS ANNA. PEOPLE JUST CLICK CONTINUOUSLY AND SOMETIMES THEY PUT IN THE REPORTS ALL IS SET TO IT THREE SECOND BURST. OF THIS TYPE OF CHEMICAL AGENT TO WHICH A CHILD WHICH I WAS AT THE TIME I WAS ONLY FOURTEEN AND FIFTEEN YEARS OLD AT THE TIME. NO THE SOMETIMES THEY UNLOADED THE WHOLE CANISTER ON ME AND SOMETIMES I WAS ON THE GROUND ALREADY RESTRAINT. AND THEN LOADED THE WHOLE CAN. SPRAINING. BUT OUT BASICALLY NO CONSENTED CONTINUE TO SCREAM YOU KNOW. I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT ALSO WAS AT THE TIME IS HARD I DIDN'T KNOW THIS PERSON WHO SPRING AND HE WORKED THERE. HE WAS A COUNSELOR AND SUPPOSED TO HELP ME OUT. BUT THE SAME TIME AFTER THE FACT I FELT. A STRONG DISLIKE TOWARDS MAN OR THE WOMAN. WHO SPREADING BECAUSE? I KNOW THEY WENT OVERBOARD. CLICK CREATED THE DISTRESS THAT WAS ALREADY THERE AND YOU JUST AND INTENSIFIED. TO HOLD DIFFERENT EXTREME WHICH IT WAS. AT A POINT WHERE WHATEVER THEY TOLD ME OR TRY TO TALK TO ME WHEN IT WAS WHENEVER IS NEEDED TO DE ESCALATE THE SITUATION. HE WAS NOT GOING TO HELP ALREADY HAVE THEIR SET IN MY MIND THIS PERSON DID ME WRONG. HE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF ME WHEN I WAS IN A BOIL POSITION IS ALREADY BAD ENOUGH THAT I'M. DEALING WITH REJECTION TRAUMA FROM MY HOME IN HOWARD BROUGHT UP IN THAT TO COME INTO A SITUATION WHERE I'M. BEING ABUSED MORE WITH CHEMICAL AGENTS. AND IT'S KIND OF JUST THROW MY LIFE AND I STILL DO DEAL WITH THIS TODAY. AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT IT'S JUST. I HOPE THIS KIND OF CAUSE AND EFFECT BECAUSE I'VE STILL GOT A FAMILY IN THE SYSTEM. AND I DON'T WANT TO GO THROUGH TO. THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. POKER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING GOING BACK AS FEEL A BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN SUPPORT. HELLO ANGELINA ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE CALIFORNIAN CHUNKS PART. GOOD MORNING MARGO TORCH FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU.

JIM WYNNE BURGER ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION THAT OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. ANY. WITNESSES AND UP. POSITION. ANOTHER SUPPORT. OF A GOOD. GOOD MORNING SABINE ACROSS CITY WITH ALL OF US ARE NONE IN STRONG SUPPORT. YOU. ME WITNESSES YOU HAVE. REALLY READY MISTER TO RECOUP MEASUREMENT GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME SOBRE O. TRICKLED ON APPEARED ON BEHALF OF THE STATE COALITION PERMISSION ORGANIZATIONS. IN OPPOSITION AB TWENTY TEN. ALTHOUGH WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS TODAY. THE BILL WILL IN ESSENCE RESULT IN A BAND OF THE USE OF PEPPER SPRAY CALIFORNIA'S YOUTH FACILITIES. THE REALITY IN ANY FIRST RESPONDER SITUATION WHETHER WE'RE TOM OF FIREFIGHTERS. PARAMEDICS POLICE OFFICER OR PROBATION OFFICERS IS THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS TYPE. THE PROBATION OFFICER LOVE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CARRY PEPPER SPRAY ON THE PERSON. YOU'RE PUTTING THE SAFETY OF JUVENILES AND STAFF IN DANGER MOTHER RETREAT PEPPER SPRAY. FROM PRESUMABLY A LOCKED CABINET AFTER RECEIVING AUTHORITY TO DO SO. UNLIKE THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL WOULD RECOGNIZE THE REALITIES INHERENT IN JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES. PARTICULAR CALIFORNIA FACILITIES. CONTRARY TO THE SEARCHES FOR IMPLICATIONS MADE BY SUPPORTERS OF THIS BILL PEPPER SPRAY IS TYPICALLY USED UNDER EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES. USING MY TOUR MORE JUVENILES ARE ENGAGE IN PHYSICAL ALTERCATION. MOST COUNTIES HAVE STRICT POLICIES GOVERNING IN RESTRICTING THE USE OF PEPPER SPRAY. SECOND. THE SPONSORS POINT TO A STUDY OF THE COUNCIL OF JUVENILE CORRECTION MINISTRIES FROM TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN. IN ARGUE THAT ONLY TWENTY NINE PERCENT AGENCIES A LOT FOR THE USE OF CHEMICAL RESTRAINTS. HERE IS SOMETHING THE SPONSORED NOT TELL YOU FROM THE SAME STUDY. OF THE STATE TO DO PROHIBIT PURPOSE FOR ONLY TEN ALSO PROHIBIT ISOLATION OR SOLITARY CONFINEMENT OF THE JUVENILES. SIXTEEN FAITH OF BANNED THE USE OF PEPPER SPRAY CONTINUED UP ISOLATION AS AN OPTION. EVERY MONTH I REMIND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JUST THREE YEARS AGO THESE VERY SAME SPONSORS WERE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTING. SIGNIFICANT LIMITS ISOLATION CALIFORNIA. THIS IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE REALITY IN JUVENILE FACILITIES THAT THE PROBATION OFFICERS. NEEDED DETERRENT TO BE ABLE TO ASSURE THE SAFETY OF THE GERMAN OFFICE STUFF LIKE. IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR JUVENILES TO ONE FACT IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR SEVERAL JUVENILES TO FIND AT THE SAME TIME. SITUATION LIKE THIS COMMUTER IT VERY QUICKLY. TIME IS NOT A LUXURY AFFORDED TO OFFICERS IN THESE SITUATIONS IT IS NOT REALISTIC OR PRACTICAL TO PRESUME. THAT IT OFFICER WILL HAVE TIME TO SEEK AUTHORIZATION TO RETREAT PURPOSE BAY FROM A LOCKED CABINET IN ANOTHER AREA. THERE ARE OTHER PRACTICAL REALITIES THAT SEPARATE CALIFORNIA FROM OTHER STATES. JUVENILE FACILITIES CURRENTLY HOUSE MINERS THAT ARE CHARGING SENSE AS ADULTS CHARGES CENTS WITH SEVERAL SEVENTY SERIOUS FELONIES AS A RESULT CALIFORNIA IN ALL LIKELIHOOD. HAS MORE DANGEROUS YOU'RE WRONG JUVENILES ARE SOLUTION OTHER STATES THIS POPULATION IS SET TO EXPAND AND LET OF GOVERNOR BROWN'S BUDGET PROPOSAL TO RAISE THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX. PERCENT AS JUVENILES TO REMAIN IN JUVENILE FACILITIES. SUPPORT OF THE BILL ALSO SITE OKLAHOMA'S AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT TO DO AND THE BENEFIT OF USING DE ESCALATION TACTICS OF COURSE. WE SUPPORT AND USE SUCH TACTICS EVERYDAY. HERE'S A THOUGHT THAT SUPPORTERS OF NOT SHARED ABOUT OKLAHOMA. THEIR STAFFING RATIOS ARE ONE OFFICER PER TWO TO SIX JUVENILES. MANY STATES HAVE ADOPTED FEDERAL STANDARDS OF ONE EIGHT JUVENILES CALIFORNIA IS NOT ONE OF THEM. OUR RATES WITH EITHER ONE TO TEN OFFICERS. OR ONE TO FIFTEEN. MY FINAL COMMENT THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF PROBATION OFFICERS IN THE FIELD BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE IN REHABILITATION IN FACT MOST JUVENILES. WINTER THE FACILITY AND LEAVE NEVER COME BACK CONTRARY TO THE ADULT SYSTEM. THE JUVENILE RESTRICT RECIDIVISM RATE IS EXTREMELY LOW. THAT IS A TESTAMENT TO THE WORKS COUPLE MEMBERS TO EVERYDAY. AND MANY FACILITIES MAJORITY OFFICERS ARE WOMEN. THESE WOMEN ARE TASK SUPERVISING JUVENILES THE ROUGH AND FULLY GROWN MEN. EXTRA TO OVER TWENTY POUNDS THEY DO SO EVERY DAY. IF AB TWENTY TENANTS ELECTED. YOU WILL BE PUTTING A RISK THE SAFETY OF THE JUVENILES AND STAFF IF YOU'RE NOT THEY BE TWENTY TEN. THEN SURE BE PREPARED TO LOWER THE STAFFING RATIOS RATIOS REPEAL THE RESTRICTIONS ON ROOM CONFINED AND SEPARATE MORE SERIOUS OFFENDERS FROM OTHER JUVENILE OFFENDERS. AND YOU SHOULD BE PART EXCEPT THAT THE ONLY MEANS OR LEAVING OFFICERS TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF ALL JUVENILES IN THE FACILITIES. IS PHYSICAL FORCE AN INTERVENTION. THAT IS THE REALITY THIS BILL CREATE NOT A VIOLENCE FREE NEVADA. SPONSORED PORTRAIT LIKE YOU. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BRIAN RICHARD I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS A CALIFORNIA'S WELL AS MYSELF BITCHY PROBATION OFFICER BELL DORADO COUNTY. I'M HERE YOU KNOW VOTE TODAY ON AB TWENTY TEN SO WELL INTENTIONED PIECE OF LEGISLATION BUT IT'S PREMATURE AND IT IS POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS. BEFORE I GET TO THE REASONS FORTY MY POSITION AT LIKE TO OFFER YOU SOME PERSPECTIVE. NO DOUBT YOU'RE AWARE THE JUVENILE JUSTICE IN CALIFORNIA HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST DECADE. BEGINNING WITH THE JUVENILE JUSTICE REALIGNMENT ACT TEN YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA PROBATION INDUSTRY HAS RETOOLED INTO AN EVIDENCE BASED PROFESSION. AS A RESULT WE'VE SEEN A SIXTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN DETENTION NUMBERS. A SEVENTY THREE PERCENT REDUCTION IN JUVENILE ARRESTS AND A NINETY PERCENT. AND NINETY PERCENT OF ALL JUVENILES WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE COMMUNITY ARE BEING TREATED IN THAT COMMUNITY. AS A REFERENCE THIS COLOSSAL SHIFT IN IT IN OUTCOMES STEMS FROM THE ADOPTION OF AN EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH TO CORRECTIONS. WE SHIFTED FROM DOING WHAT FEELS RIGHT TO WHAT IS RIGHT. RESEARCH HAS PROVEN THAT CONTINUED DETENTION CAN BE AND OFTEN IS HARMFUL TO YOU. WHEN ALTERNATIVES TO DETENTION ARE PERMISSIBLE WE USE THEM. WE UNDERSTAND THE DELINQUENCY OFTEN RESULTS FROM A HISTORY OF TRAUMA. WE STRIVE TO REDUCE TRAUMA IN THE LIVES OF YOUTH INCLUDING SYSTEMS INDUCED DRAMAS LIKE DETENTION. WE HAVE LEARNED TO TREAT THE ENTIRETY OF THE USE CONDITION RATHER THAN SIMPLY RESPONDING TO THEIR BEHAVIOR AND DELINQUENCY. WHEN YOU HAVE TO REMAINING CUSTOM TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC OR TO PROTECT YOU. WE USE COGNITIVE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS. SUCH AS MORE RECOGNITION THERAPY AND AGGRESSION REPLACEMENT THERAPY. WE USE PRESS SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT TRAUMA INFORMED CARE SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT AND EDUCATION. WE DO THESE THINGS OUR INSTITUTIONS AND WE DO THEM IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT IS TO SAY WE IDENTIFIED IN ADOPTED THOSE PRACTICES THAT SCIENTIFICALLY LEAD TO BETTER OUTCOMES WE ABANDON THOSE THAT DON'T. AND WE HAVE SEEN IMPROVED OUTCOMES AS A RESULT. WITH RESPECT AB TWENTY TEN AND THE AUTHORS WELL INTENTIONED GOALS THERE'S SIMPLY NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE CLAIMS MADE ABOUT THE USE OF CHEMICAL RESTRAINTS IN DETENTION FACILITIES. BUT THE FCC JUST COMPLETED ITS REVISION OF THE REGULATIONS GOVERNING FACILITY OPERATIONS AND THE USE OF O. C. WAS HEAVILY MODERATED THIRTY SECONDS THANK YOU BY MANY PRACTITIONERS AND ADVOCATES. THE REGULATIONS CONTINUE TO PERMIT USE AND PROVIDE FOR REASONABLE MEASURED REQUIREMENTS ON TRAINING REPORTING. THE BOARD'S DISCUSSIONS RELATED TO SEE USE USE FOCUSED ON THE FACT BEFORE CHANGE THE POLICY IS MADE THERE'S A NEED TO STUDY THE USE OF OC. TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS A DETRIMENT OR IN FACT A HARM REDUCTION TOOL IN FACILITIES. IN MY FACILITY ITSELF WE'VE HAD A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOR EVENTS DOCUMENTED THAT WERE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIABLE USES OF FORCE. WE HAD SIXTY EIGHT ASSAULTS IN THE FACILITY THAT WERE EITHER YOU THOUGHT ON YOUTH OR YOU FOUND STAFF. WE HAD FIFTY SIX USES OF FORCE AS A RESULT OF THOSE ASSAULTS. ZERO INSTANCES OF PEPPER SPRAY OVER THE LAST YEAR AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MY STAFF CARRIES PEPPER SPRAY ON THEM. BUT WE ARE HEAVILY RESTRAINED IN ITS USE IN OUR FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW IT AND THAT'S THE POWER WE EXERCISE. THANK YOU COULD HOLD UP FOR SECOND RATE STEPS UP WARM. MUCH LIKE TO RECALL ROLE.

GOOD MORNING JESSICA ELEVEN TEN THE UP YOU HAVE TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. JEAN SOLD AT ALL. I HAVE WORKED IN THE JUVENILE DEFENSE I STRONGLY OPPOSE. THANK YOU. ANNE. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. A QUIRK. SO I'M HAVING A HARD TIME WITH THIS BILL. LONG I ED MISTER TRIGO FEW COULD COME UP. AND I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE OF THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THIS. SO OTHER STATES. DO ALLOW SOLITARY CONFINEMENT BUT FRANKLY I DOUBT THAT THAT. YELLING AT SOMEONE IF YOU DON'T STOP YOU'RE GOING TO GO INTO SOLITARY CONFINEMENT WOULD HELP STOP THE FIGHT. I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S THE WAY KIDS WHO GET INTO A FIGHT. THINK. SO THE QUESTION IS. IF OTHER STATES DON'T NEED PEPPER SPRAY. STOP A FIGHT. WHAT DID THEY DO IT APPARENTLY THERE'S ONLY? A HANDFUL OF STATES THAT DO ALLOW IT. IF YOU. I MEAN. YOU HAVE A RESPONSE TO THAT I CAN ALSO ASK THE SUPPLY I DO I DO HAVE A RESPONSE WAS PART OF MY COMMENTS. FIRST. SEVERAL STATES THAT TO HAVE BANNED THE USE PEPPER SPRAY CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE RUMORS PICTURE SOLITARY CONFINEMENT THAT'S ONE. POSSIBLE TOOL. OR DETERRENT EFFECT. THE OTHER FACTOR IS THAT MANY OTHER STATES HAVE ADOPTED THE. LOWER HOME STAFF RATIOS SHE HAVE MORE STAFF AVAILABLE SO THERE'S OUTCOME THERE'S A COMBINATION OF FACTORS. THAT ALLOW THE STAFF TO HAVE. ALRIGHT A GREATER ABILITY TO CONTROL SITUATION. EGGMAN EASILY OUT OF HAND SO IN CALIFORNIA NEW RATIOS ARE ONE TO TEN. THE PODS ARE TYPICALLY TWENTY OR THIRTY JUVENILE SO RIGHT YOU HAVE TO STAFF TO TWENTY KIDS PER THREE STEP THIRTY KIDS. THAT COULD POTENTIALLY GET DETERRENT IN A REAL HURRY. SPECIAL IF YOU DON'T HAVE SOLITUDE YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO. BUT THE KIDS IN A ROOM STRUCTURE SITUATION ORDERED TO SAY ANNOUNCE. WE ARE ABOUT THE PEPPER SPRAY. THEN IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THE CITRUS AND CONTROL. ALRIGHT OF WHAT TO THE SUPPORTERS HAVE TO STAY WHAT IS DONE IN OTHER STATES. IT'S IT'S NOT REALLY A MYSTERY WHAT WHAT TO DO IN IS AND. AYE I BELIEVE YEAH OF THE PROBATION OFFICERS IN THE STATE ARE ALSO TRAINED TO DO SOME OF THESE THINGS ALREADY YEAH. IT'S CREATING A FACILITY CULTURE WHERE. INTERVENTIONS ARE DONE IN ADVANCE. IT IS CREATING A CULTURE WHERE YOUNG PEOPLE FEEL SAFE ALREADY IN THERE NOT AS INCLINED TO. START ON STATE SITUATIONS I THINK EDGAR CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TO THAT. IT'S KNOWING THE TRIGGERS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE BEFORE THEY ARE OUT. YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S NOT A MAGIC BULLET IT'S IT'S HARD WORK AND BUT OTHER STATES HAVE DONE IT I I DISAGREE WITH THE IDEA THAT CALIFORNIA'S YOU THERE SO MUCH WORSE. THEN THE YOUTH AND OTHER STATES WE HAVE YOUTH AND OTHER STATES WHO ARE ALSO. DETAINED FOR VERY SERIOUS OFFENSES FOR MURDER FOR ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON. AND YOU KNOW WE KNOW WHAT TO DO THOSE FACILITIES ARE DOING IT SAFELY THERE'S NOT REALLY A REASON WHY CALIFORNIA CAN'T. MOM ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS A REASON MR TARIQ I JUST GAVE WHICH IS THAT THEY HAVE BETTER STAFFING RATIOS. SORRY I YEAH I WAS CONFUSED GUY HEADS DAMN BETTER STAFFING RATIOS WHAT ABOUT THAT ARGUMENT. WELL I MEAN I. DO THINK IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR. TEAR THAT ARGUMENT I YOU KNOW. I. DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT WE HAVE. ANY CONCRETE NUMBERS ON STAFFING RATIOS FOR EVERY STATE THAT DOESN'T USE PEPPER SPRAY HAVE HEARD SORT OF THE ASSERTION THAT MANY PLACES DO HAVE BETTER STAFFING RATIOS BUT I. HAVEN'T SEEN ANY. ANY INFORMATION TO REALLY BACK THAT UP BY I DON'T KNOW THAT TO BE THE CASE ON EVEN SO IF YOU KNOW THAT THAT POINTS TO. A DIFFERENT OPTION OUR STAFFING RATIOS ARE NOT MANDATORY. SYSTEMS IN THIS IN THE STATE ARE FREE TO HIGH HER MORE MORE PROBATION OFFICERS MORE PROBATION COUNSELORS IF THEY FEEL THAT THEY CAN'T RUN THEIR FACILITY SAFELY FOR YOUTH. WITH THE CURRENT STAFFING RATIOS THEY HAVE. ON THE THAT'S A FLOOR NOT A CEILING AND SAID SO IT'S MAY REQUIRE REALLOCATION OF RESOURCES BUT. I BELIEVE THAT THAT THE SAFETY OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR FACILITIES IS WORTH THAT. WELL CLEARLY WHAT THE OTHER WITNESSES SAID IT I MEAN YOU WERE PIANIST THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND. IF FEWER RESTRAINED. SOMEONE WAS USING PEPPER SPRAY THAT'S JUST PLAIN ABUSE. YOU KNOW IN TALKING WITH OUR ALAMEDA COUNTY PROBATION. I KNOW THAT. THEY FELT IT WAS ESSENTIAL AND I KNOW THOSE PEOPLE AND THEY'RE GOOD PEOPLE. AND. THEY JUST FEEL IT'S ESSENTIAL. ARM AND I KNOW HOW MUCH THEY LOVE THE PEOPLE IN THEIR CARE. SO I'M TRYING TO RECONCILE THAT WITH WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HERE. ABSOLUTELY AND AYE EAT AYE I'M NOT SEEING ANY OF MY TESTIMONY TODAY TO CAST ASPERSIONS ON THE FOLKS WHO ARE STAFFING THESE FACILITIES AT MANY OF WHOM GENUINELY CARE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN GOING TO THIS LINE OF WORK. FOR ALL THE RIGHT REASONS. I THINK IT IS THE CASE WHEN ONE HAS A TOOL ONE BECOMES ACCUSTOMED TO USING THAT TOOL. ON AND WHILE IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO ENVISION DOING THE JOB WITHOUT IT WE KNOW THAT THAT STAFFER ADAPTABLE AND ARE ABLE TO DO IT I'M YOU KNOW WE'VE. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH DOCTOR GRISSOM WHEN HE WAS HERE VISITING BUT. STAFF IN OKLAHOMA WERE ALSO VERY ACCUSTOMED TO USING PEPPER SPRAY THEY HAD A TWO YEAR SCHEDULE FOR ELIMINATING ITS USE. ON THAT SCHEDULE WAS ACCELERATED BECAUSE STAFF FOUND THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO ADAPT ON AND AND SO I I BELIEVE THAT THE THE STAFF HERE IN CALIFORNIA ARE JUST AS DEDICATED TO YOUNG PEOPLE WHERE WAS THAT. OKLAHOMA. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. MR DRACO SAID MR. CHOW. WAS THAT PRESUMABLY THE PEPPER SPRAY HAS HAD LOCKED AREA. A. AND YOU'RE ALLOWING IT FOR CERTAIN EMERGENCIES. ARE HOW WOULD YOU ENVISION THAT. MORE ON THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF THE DETAILS. OF YOU KNOW WOULD STILL HAVE TO BE WORKED OUT AS TO WHAT THE STORY IS GOING TO BE BUT I THINK IF I COULD RESPOND TO YOUR PREVIOUS QUESTION AND THAT IS SO. UP YOU KNOW. I THINK IT ALL COMES OUT OF BALANCING ACT I MEAN I THINK A YOU KNOW WHAT. WE KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE THAT'S BEEN RACES THAT WISE AT THAT CALIFORNIA IS ONLY ONE OF THE FEW ONE OF THE ONLY SIX STATES THAT STILL WOULD. ARE ALLOW THE USE OF PEPPER SPRAY SO WE LOOK TO OTHER STATES AS TO WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN DOING ALL TO ALLEVIATE THE SITUATION AT. AND ARE YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT TAKING THE THE THE TEMPLE AWAY FROM THE OFFICE IT WAS TO SENSIBLY SAYING THAT. ARE YOU CAN STILL USE IT YOU KNOW INSERT CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THEY NEED TO USE IT TO DE ESCALATE THE SITUATION FOR EXAMPLE IS A RIOT OR SOMETHING. UP. BUT WE WANT TO LOOK AT YOU KNOW IT'S A BALANCING ACT SO WHAT WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT WE ARE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELL BEING OF THAT BUT. ONCE YOU PUT YA THE THAT ON ON ONE SIDE OF THE EQUATION AND THEN THE HARMFUL AFFECTED WHAT THE PURPOSE PAY WOULD PUT ON. A THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND ALSO. SO SO YOU KNOW AS TO WHAT WHAT IS IT THAT WHAT IS THE FINE LINE THAT WE DRAWING SO SO THAT IS THAT THAT IS THAT YOU KNOW THE. THE. YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS THE CHALLENGE AND WE ALSO HEARD. THAT ARE YOU KNOW YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE A FEAR. FOR THEIR SAFETY MORE THAN AVERAGE OF THIS REALLY IS AN ANSWER TO MY QUESTION ABOUT I'D I'VE HEARD THOSE ARGUMENTS FROM YOU BREAK FOR SO I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO GO FURTHER INTO THAT THERE'S ARE ON. LONG DAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. I'M SORRY. EDU FINISH RICH WITH. AND MISTER SANTIAGO. YEAH NOT THINK YOU ARE THE SPONSORS AND AND THE AUTHOR. AND HERE'S WHY STRUGGLE WITH RIGHT. DO I FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE A BETTER ENVIRONMENT TO I FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE. THAT WE NEED TO ELIMINATE THAT SORT OF CULTURAL SOMEBODY. IS DETAINED THEM EMPTIVELY WE WANT THEM THEIR CAREER REHABILITATE. I DO. AND I'M ALWAYS A FAN OF THE CARROT THE STICK I'M. BUT I WHAT I ENVISION THIS RIGHT I THINK ABOUT IF THIS WOULD BE TO BE IMPLEMENTED WHAT I WHAT MY THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE. WITHIN THOSE FACILITIES I NOTICED THAT SOUNDS. A BIT WILD SAY BUT I STRUGGLED. A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND I FIRST GOT HERE AND WE HAD THAT CONVERSATION ABOUT SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. AND I AND A VOTING FOR IT. BUT THEY WERE MARRIED CONVERSATION COMMITTED THERE WAS MERITED POLICY POINTS AS TO WHY. IT'S STILL NEED TO BE ENACTED AND I FIND MYSELF. HERE AGAIN STRUGGLING BECAUSE. AS I UNDERSTOOD THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN. IF ADMINISTRATOR HAS TO PROVE IT IF IT'S IN A LOCKER. LET ME EXPLAIN SUFFER SECOND SCENARIO A. A FIGHT OCCURS. PULL UP THE PEPPER SPRAY FOLKS GET DOWN. WHAT'S THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THAT PEOPLE CAN GET HURT. TEN FIFTEEN SECONDS. THE PLACE OUT A SECOND COUSIN AREA. BUT BREAKS OUT. GO GET ADMINISTRATOR LET'S GET APPROVAL LET'S GO TO THE LOCKER. A MINUTE OF OF OF OF FOLKS BEAT EACH OTHER UP. AND THAT'S BRUTAL. I TWO EXTREMELY BRUTAL SCENARIO TO ALLOW THAT TO HAPPEN. AND THAT THAT'S WHY STRUGGLE WITH IT BECAUSE. I. I WANT TO AIR ON WHAT'S THE MORE HUMANE THING TO DO. WITHOUT THE WITHOUT ALL THE NEGATIVE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE AN INDIVIDUAL. INSIDE AIR IT THE I DON'T WANT HIM TO GET HURT AND. AND I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT THAT SORT OF. BEATEN DOWN ON KIDS ARE MISUSING IT OR THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF IT. BUT IF I WANT TO TAKE. STRUGGLE WITHIN THE HIM MOST MOST MORE HUMANE APPROACH TO DO IT. IS WHEN THIS BREAKS OUT. I WANT THAT TO BE CLEAR AND TEN SECONDS FIFTEEN SECONDS EVEN OF A MEAN SPRING. DO THAT REQUIRE BETTER TRAINING DOES THAT. WHEN INCLUDING COULD NOT BE USED A AND WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH THAT CONVERSATION WHEN IT COMES A USE OF FORCE IN THIS BUILDING. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A. MAYBE YOU SAW FOR THE THE USE OF SPRAY IS PROBABLY A BETTER PLACE TO BEGIN THAT SORT OF CONVERSATIONS I WON'T REITERATE STAFFING WHICH I WILL REITERATE ALL THESE. ALL THESE OTHER THINGS BUT THAT'S REALLY RIGHTS TROUBLE MISTER CHAIRS IN TERMS OF. WHAT'S THE MORE HUMANE THING TO DO. PLAYED OUT. AND I WONDER IF YOU MAY BE THE IF THE SPONSORS CAN SPEAK TO THAT OR THE AUTHOR COULD DIRECT RESPONSES TO TO SPEAK TO THAT IF. IF APPROPRIATE. HA WHICH IS THE REASON WHY WE ARE DELAYING IMPLEMENTATION OFFER TWO YEARS I THINK. FOR. FORCED TO CUT YOU KNOW COME UP WITH A TRAINING ARE PLANNED TO YOU KNOW TO BASICALLY. TRAIN THE OFFICERS ON ON DE ESCALATION METHODS I THINK YOU KNOW IT IT YOU KNOW THE SAME ANSWER THAT I GAVE EARLY IT'S A BALANCING ACT I MEAN ON ONE HAND. WILL YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE HARM IN ON THE OTHER HAND WHAT IS THE GOOD SO. ARM WE BELIEVE THAT TO US LIKE I SAID WE'RE NOT TAKING. THE CHEMICAL SPRAY AWAY FROM THE OFFICE OR WAS IT SIMPLY SAYING THEY CANNOT CARRY THE SPRAY ON THEIR BODY ON THEIR PUT IN A DEPOSITION. AND SO ARM. SO SO WHERE WHERE IS THE LINE I MEAN I THINK THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE SO. WHERE ALLOWING TWO YEAR PERIOD TO TRAIN THE OFFICERS OF SO THAT WE CAN ALL KIND OF FACE SEDAN AND IN THE MEANTIME WE LOOK AT ALL THE SEATS WERE PUT TO BEEN DOING? SO WHAT IS THE MOST HUMANE WAY OF DOING IT SO SO THAT IS THE. AND. MATT MATT I ASKED. SO MUCH OF THE QUESTION I HAVE REMAINING WOULD BE THE LET LET'S SAY SEVERE DOES BREAK OUT. AND IT ESCALATES. WHAT WOULD? HOW YOU THE VISION THAT HAPPENING TEHAMA HOW MUCH TIME HOW MANY KIDS GET HURT? WELL THAT'S A. VERY. SUBJECTIVE LA QUESTION I I THINK I YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK WE WANT DON'T LIMIT THE THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND WE DON'T WANT TO SPECIFY. IS YOU KNOW AS TO HOW LONG WE SHOULD. I THINK IT'S A JUDGMENT CALL ON ON THE PART OF THE OFFICER I THINK IF THE OFFICER DEEMS IT NECESSARY TO RESORT TO USING THIS RATE I THINK THAT'S WHEN. YOU KNOW WHEN HE OR SHE SHOULD DO THAT. ARM SO. YOU KNOW IT IT DEPENDS ON THE SITUATION I MEAN THERE'S NO FOUNTAIN YOU KNOW. RULE AND IN IN DETERMINING DOT I I BELIEVE SO IT ONE TIME AND THAT'S ALL. I JUST LIKE TO SAY AT YOU KNOW. WHAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST MENTIONED RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE HARD AND FAST RULES ABOUT ABOUT HOW SPACE SHOULD BE USED THEIR A COUNTIES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED PROTOCOLS AND COUNTIES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED RESTRICTIONS AND? ENDS. THAT'S THAT'S FANTASTIC I THINK THAT CONVERSATION DOES NEED TO HAPPEN BY THE WAY I DO YEAH LUNCH SHOULDN'T SHOULDN'T WE ARE ABSOLUTELY OPEN TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION. BUT. WHAT I THINK WE? SHOULD RECOGNIZE IS THAT THERE'S A WIDE VARIATION ACROSS THE STATE BOTH IN TERMS OF WHAT THE FACILITIES LOOK LIKE AND WHAT THEIR POLICIES ARE. AND SO IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO SORT OF. AT THIS POINT SAY. WITH OUR BILL WHAT'S THAT WHAT'S THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IT A YOUTH MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIGHT. IS. I WANTED TO POINT OUT I THINK I THINK WE KEEP HEARING FACILITY ADMINISTRATOR ITS FACILITY ADMINISTRATOR OR DESIGNEES. SO IT IS POSSIBLE TO PUT PROTOCOLS INTO PLACE THAT. WOULD MAKE THAT DOESN'T NEED VERY EASILY ACCESSIBLE THAT WOULD HAVE THE PEPPERS RESTORED IN AN EASILY ACCESSIBLE LOCATION THAT IS NOT PHYSICALLY ON THE OFFICERS I THINK WHEN WE'RE ENVISIONING A SYSTEM WHERE WE'RE HAVING TO CALL. THE CHIEF YOU KNOW THE HEAD OF THE FACILITY AND RUN TO A DIFFERENT ROOM GRAB THIS BREAK COME BACK. THAT DOESN'T THAT'S NOT REQUIRED BY THIS BILL AYE AYE FULLY CONFIDENT IN THE ABILITY OF FOLKS TO COME UP WITH PROTOCOLS THAT FIT WITHIN THIS BILL THAT WILL. REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME EXCUSE ME. BEFORE BEFORE IT CAN BE USED APPROPRIATELY MISTER JIM ASKING A QUESTION. OKAY. THEN I. I WILL MAKE IT MY LAST THAT'S OKAY WITH MISTER. AND SO HERE'S THE OTHER POINT THAT STRUGGLE WITH RIGHT. RIGHT NOW SCENARIO BREAKS OUT. I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THAT THAT. OFFICER SPRAY SPRING HERE THAN TO ENGAGE. IF YOU ENGAGE. IT DID THAT LEADS TO AIM A MUCH WORSE PASS IN TERMS OF RELATIONSHIPS AT THE MENTION PEOPLE GET HURT NOT TO MENTION. BUT IT ESCALATES THE SITUATION. SOMEONE ME LIES IN THAT BETTER TO HAVE A CARE IN THE STICK. THEN TO HAVE BUT NOT THAT HAVE AN OFFICER ENGAGE. I UNDERSTAND THAT CONCERNED. BUT I THINK THAT IT POINTS TO SORT OF A FALSE DICHOTOMY I I DON'T THINK. IN SITUATIONS THAT I'VE REVIEWED THAT I'VE HEARD. FROM FOLKS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED IT IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF ARE WE GOING TO SPRING IN THE AIR OR ARE WE GOING TO PHYSICALLY INTERVENE PHYSICAL INTERVENTION OCCURS WHEN SPRAYS USE. IN IN MANY IF IN MANY CASES.% AND SO IT'S NOT AS THOUGH SPRAY IS STOPPING PHYSICAL INTERVENTIONS FROM HAPPENING ON IT'S IT'S USED IN TANDEM. AND SO I THINK THE IDEA THAT THERE'S JUST A SIMPLE SPRING THE ARIES IS IS NOT EXACTLY HOW IT ACTUALLY WORKS IN FACILITIES I THINK. OKAY. ANYMORE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE MACHINE. MIKLOS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS LET LET ME CLOSE BY SAYING THAT I I HAVE THEM UTMOST RESPECT FOR OUR OFFICERS WHO STAFF FOR JUVENILE FACILITIES AND. AND A FULLY UNDERSTAND HOW TO OF THE JOB CAN BE. ARE YOU KNOW AS I STATED BEFORE THE INTENT OF THE BILL EYES NOT TO PUT THE OFFICER OR TO THE YOUNG PERSON IN HARM'S WAY BUT RATHER TO FOCUS ON THE. OTHER FOSTERING A BETTER ENVIRONMENT. AND RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE OFFICER AND THE YOUNG PERSON. AND. YOU KNOW AS I SEATED AGAIN I MEAN WE'RE NOT COMPLETELY BANNING THE CHEMICAL. IN THESE FACILITIES. WOULD MERELY SAYING THAT OFFICER SHOULD NOT HAVE. TO THOSE COMPOSED RIGHT ON THEIR BODY NOW AS TO THE QUESTION EARLIER. LOCAL JURISDICTION CAN MAKE THEIR OWN DETERMINATION AS TO WHEN AND WHAT THEY WE HOW LONG BEFORE THE USE THAT THE CHEMICAL. SO ARM SO I THOUGHT I THINK AGAIN IS A BALANCING ACT AND AND I THINK OUR YOU KNOW IT IT. LET ME JUST REITERATE THE FACT THAT ALL THE THE. THE OBJECTIVE OF SENDING OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO THESE FACILITIES IS NOT TO PUNISH THEM BUT ARE JUST RATHER TO HELP THEM TO OUR HELP THEM REHABILITATE. AND AND SO THAT THEY BECOME PART OF THE CITY THE SOCIETY AGAIN. ANTS SO WE WANT TO PROVIDE E. A. L. ENVIRONMENT THAT'S CONDUCIVE FOR THEM TO TO FOSTER THAT RELATIONSHIP SO I THINK ON BALANCE I THINK OUT. YOU KNOW THIS IS A GOOD TO A GOOD BALANCE. THE U. BETWEEN THE TWO SO WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK HER ABOUT. AND THANK YOU ARE NOT YET YOU KNOW THIS IS BEEN A DIFFICULT ONE AS I'VE GONE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE PROPONENT. AND THE SUPPORTER. AND. IN SOME WAY DON'T APOLOGIZE TO THE. TO THE AUTHOR TO THE SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS THAT. MY FIRST SUGGESTION. WHICH WAS TO DO A STUDY. BECAUSE AS DE SUPPORTERS CAME IN AND TOLD ME ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES THAT USING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THAT WE NEEDED TO TO STUDY IT SORT IT WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN MOVING FORWARD. OF BUT AS. AS SOMEONE IS ALWAYS TRYING TO GET TO THE IDEAL UTOPIA DID YOU HAVE REALITY. AND HERE WE HAVE REALITY BUMPING UP AGAINST. EACH OTHER AND I KNOW BOTH SIDES HAVE NOT ALWAYS. COMMUNICATED AND NOT WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE WHICH MIGHT FULL INTENT WHICH. WAS TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO FORCE BOTH SIDES. COME TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH THE PLAN. AND STATE OF. BATTLING BACK AND FORTH ABOUT WHAT IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE MEANS EVEN. SOME OF THEM THEY'D THE OPERATIONS AND LA COUNTY WHERE THEY WAY THE PAPER PEPPER SPRAY AFTER. THERE'S AN INTERACTION WITH WHAT DID YOU LEARN HOW SEEM LIKE A A A GOOD SOLUTION. BUT AGAIN I STUDY HERE MORE SOLUTIONS AND SO. YOU KNOW LIKE I I ASKED AYE PIT AYE WITH WITH AMENDMENT BECAUSE I WAS PUSHING. TO MAKE SURE THAT ON DOES TIME FOR IMPLEMENTATION IT'S TIME FOR BY IN. FROM THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO IMPLEMENT IF. I AM EXTREMELY CONCERNED WHEN TO DON'T HAVE COMPLETE BY AND FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO IMPLEMENT IT. BECAUSE OF. MANY TIMES WE DON'T GET. WHAT YOU ULTIMATELY WANT? AND SO OP. ED. EIGHT IT IN ANY CAN SEE THE. HOW EVEN MEMBERS HERE ARE CONFLICTED BETWEEN THE SAFETY OF OFFICERS? THE SAFETY OF YOUNG PEOPLE. AND AND JUST MAKING SURE WE DIDN'T TAKE THIS TO THIS NEXT LEVEL. AREN'T WE ALL WANT TO TAKE TO THE NEXT LEVEL. AND AND I PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE. TOLD STUCK. EARLY ON WITH THE AUTHOR THAT WE NEEDED TO REALLY DO SOME KIND OF COMPREHENSIVE STUDY ON THIS AND SO ON. IF HE GETS OUT. I WILL. STILL PUSH FOR SOME KIND A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY IF IT DOESN'T GET OUT. DO WE DEFINITELY NEED TO HAVE. COMPREHENSIVE STUDY ON IS GOOD IS IMPORTANT. AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE TO THAT NEXT LEVEL. OF OF INCARCERATION FOR OUR YOUTH. AND HAS TO BE A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT. IT REALLY HAS TO BE A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT. AND SO. MEN SECRETARY CALLED.

BUILDING UP WELL THANK THANK WAS CHAIR. MISS MELENDEZ. AB THIRTY TWENTY SIX GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I BELIEVE THE LAST TIME THAT DOTSON HAD TO COMMITTEE HEARING CLEAR SOMETHING UP I WAS THE VICE CHAIR OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WITHOUT. I DON'T YOU KNOW IT'S TRADITION. IT'S TRADITION. YEAH WHAT'S UP THE MIKES A VERY LOW. BUT LOW VOLUME IS. PRETTY LOW. OKAY SO GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB THREE ZERO TWO SIX THIS MORNING. WHILE THE LEGISLATION BEFORE YOU TODAY A POLL TO SECOND AMENDMENT AND AWESOME FORCES WHAT WAS WRITTEN IN THE UNITED STATES DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WHICH IS THAT WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF EVIDENT. THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL THAT THEY ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS. UNDER CURRENT LAW A PERSON MAY PASSED A RIGOROUS BACKGROUND CHECK INCOMPLETE NUMEROUS HOURS OF SAFETY TRAINING REQUIREMENTS BUT THEY CAN STILL BE DENIED A CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT. SHERIFF'S DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEONE HAS GOOD CAUSE TO RECEIVE A CCW PERMIT AND THIS HAS BEEN INTERPRETED INCONSISTENTLY ACROSS ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SACRAMENTO COUNTY ISSUED SIX THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR CCW PERMITS LOS ANGELES COUNTY YOUR COUNTY ISSUED ONLY FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR WHILE SAN FRANCISCO ISSUED ONLY FOR. KEEP IN MIND LOS ANGELES COUNTY IS ALMOST TEN TIMES LARGER IN POPULATION IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND SAN FRANCISCO HAS A POPULATION OF NEARLY ONE MILLION PEOPLE. AB THREE ZERO TWO SIX IS THE SIMPLE BELL. IT GUARANTEES THAT EVERY LAW ABIDING CITIZEN NO MATTER THEIR RACE RELIGION SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR POLITICAL AFFILIATION HAS THE RIGHT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES WITH THE CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT. AFTER PASSING ALL OTHER BACKGROUND IN SAFETY REQUIREMENTS. THIS BILL WOULD DEFINE SHARES DISCRETION OF GOOD BECAUSE AS THE NEED FOR SELF DEFENSE DEFENDING THE LIFE OF ANOTHER OR PREVENTING CRIME IN WHICH HUMAN LIFE IS THREATENED. IF A CITIZEN PASSES THE STRINGENT BACKGROUND CHECK COMPLETES UNNECESSARY FIRING TRAINING SAFETY REQUIREMENTS AND IS DEEMED TO BE A. TO HAVE GOOD CAUSE AND OF GOOD MORAL CHARACTER UNDER THIS STATUTE THEY SHALL BE ISSUED A CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WOULD ALSO GREAT INDIVIDUALS LIVING OUTSIDE CALIFORNIA THE ABILITY TO APPLY FOR CCW PERMIT UNDER SHERIFF'S DISCRETION. THERE IS NO ACCEPTABLE REASON TO DENY THEM A CCW BECAUSE SELF DEFENSE IS A RIGHT. AND IS NOT A PRIVILEGE. THIS BILL IS SUPPORTED BY VARIOUS GROUPS INCLUDING THE PINK PISTOLS THE LIBERAL GUN CLUB THE NRA GUN OWNERS OF CALIFORNIA JUST TO NAME A FEW. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT TODAY IS NIKKI STOLID FROM THE PINK PISTOLS AND RAIN SHERMAN WITH RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO MY WITNESSES AND ASK YOU TO CAREFULLY CONTEMPLATE THIS MAGNIFICENT BILL THANK YOU. YOU. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY YEAH HI I'M THE KEYS TO OUR. I'M CALIFORNIA THINK PISTOLS OUR MODEL OUR GAZE ON GET BASH WE'RE STRONG SUPPORT ARMED SELF DEFENSE. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL. THIRTY TWENTY SIX. OKAY NOW. BARREMIAN MAKE COUNTIES I LIKE GOOD CAUSE FOR CCW PERMIT DOESN'T MATTER THEM HIGH RISK A HATE CRIME ATTACKS. MOST OF WHICH HAPPEN OUTSIDE THE HOME AND WITH NO PRIOR WARNING. WHEN OUR LIVES ARE STEAK AND EFFECTIVE SELF DEFENSE CHOICES ARE DENIED BY LAW. THE LAWS NEED TO CHANGE. NATIONWIDE SIXTEEN MILLION PEOPLE HAVE CCW PERMITS. THEY ARE THE ONE THE MOST LAW ABIDING DEMOGRAPHICS IN THE COUNTRY. SHE SHE W. HOLDERS WERE PUBLIC SAFETY MANAGE WHO ARE HARD OF LONG BY NOW. SHALL ISSUE CCW LAWS ARE REASONABLE BALANCE BETWEEN SELF DEFENSE IN PUBLIC SAFETY. DON'T CALIFORNIANS DESERVE THE SAME SELF DEFENSE CHOICES THAT AMERICANS IN FORTY OTHER STATES HAVE HAD. NOW FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS EQUAL RIGHTS HAS BEEN THE CORE RIGHT OF ALL CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENTS. REGARDLESS OF WHO WE ARE WE ALL DESERVE EQUAL TREATMENT UNDER THE LAW. THIS BILLS REFORM WILL BRING EQUAL RIGHTS TO ARE UNEQUAL CCW PERMIT SYSTEM. FOR FREE QUALITY VOTE FOR ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY TWENTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AS CHAIR MEMBERS TRYING SOME OF THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION. WE REPRESENT THE THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS OF THE RIVERSIDE. LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUP. AND WE STRONG SUPPORT AB THIRTY TWENTY SIX THAT WOULD ALLOW QUALIFIED SCREENED AND TRAINED RESIDENTS TO OBTAIN A DOJ APPROVED PERMIT. TO LAWFULLY CARRY CONCEALED WEAPON AS YOU KNOW AB THIRTY TWENTY SIX IS DESPERATELY NEEDED IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY BECAUSE OUR SHERPAS FAILED. TO FULFILL HIS SWORN DUTY TO PROTECT THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA OF RIVERSIDE COUNTY. FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS OUR RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO UNACCEPTABLE IT UNACCEPTABLY. HIGH LEVELS OF CRIME INCLUDING VIOLENT CRIME. THE INABILITY OF OUR SHERIFF TO PROTECT OUR RESIDENTS COMPELS THEM TO TAKE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES. AB THIRTY TWENTY SIX WILL ENSURE THAT ALL QUALIFIED RESIDENTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND OTHERS. AFTER COMPLETING THE REQUIRED PAPERWORK MANDATORY BACKGROUND CHECK AND PAYING THE REQUIRED FEES THE TOLL PROCESS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY TAKES ABOUT TWO YEARS. TO GET OF THE APPROVAL. TO LIVE TO THE SHERIFF AND IF HE DOESN'T LIKE THE UPHILL OR FOR SOME OTHER REASON THE SHERIFF MAY DENY IT FOR ANY OTHER REASON THE SHERIFF MAY DENY THE ISSUANCE OF THE PERMITS. MRS RESULTED IN THE DENIAL OF CCW PERMITS FOR MANY QUALIFIED APPLICANTS WELL THOSE WITH PERSONAL POLITICAL OR FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR SHERIFF. HAVE THE CCW PERMITS APPROVED AN EXPEDITED. SHERIFF'S WASN'T HERE TO A CLEAR CONSISTENT AND OBJECTIVE POLICY. FOR THE ISSUANCE OF THE CCW PERMITS PERSONAL PREFERENCE MUST NOT DETERMINE WHETHER SOMEONE GOES TO THE FRONT OR BACK OF THE PERMIT LINE. OR MORE IMPORTANTLY WHERE THE CCW AB CAN RESULT MEDLEY APPROVED. PERSONAL PROTECTION CANNOT BE LEFT TO THE WHIM OF ONE ELECTED OFFICIAL. RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION APPRECIATES THE EFFORTS HERE. TO ESTABLISH A STATEWIDE STANDARD FOR ISSUANCE OF CCW PERMITS THEREBY ALLOWING CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS TO BETTER PREPARE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND OTHERS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT.

MINUTES APIECE WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE UP MY NAME IS ARIF I LICK COMPETE ON APPEARING ON BEHALF OF GIFFORD'S LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. NOW ABOUT FORMER CONGRESSWOMAN GABBY GIFFORDS AND HAVE TO MARK KELLY ORGANIZATION HAS WORKED FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO ENACT EVIDENCE BASED POLICY REFORMS TO SAVE LIVES FROM GUN VIOLENCE. AND WHERE REGRETFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO DETERMINE WHO IN THEIR COMMUNITIES SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO CARRY CONCEALED LOADED WEAPONS. IN PUBLIC OUR STATE. HISTORICALLY ALMOST EVERY STATE PROHIBITED ARE STRICTLY LIMITED THE CARRYING OF CONCEALED LOADED WEAPONS IN PUBLIC PLACES. THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE AMONG THE EARLIEST GUN LAWS ADOPTED THE UNITED STATES. IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY SOME STATES INCLUDING OURS BEGIN TO GRANT LAW ENFORCEMENT SOME DISCRETION TO ISSUE CCW LICENSES TO RESIDENTS WHO PASSED THE BACKGROUND CHECK RECEIVED FARM SAFETY TRAINING AND OR DEMONSTRATED. A PARTICULAR NEED TO CARRY HAD UNLOADED GUNS IN PUBLIC. AT THE BEHEST OF THE GUN LOBBY AND ACTIVISTS HOWEVER MANY SEATS IF WE CAN THESE LICENSING REQUIREMENTS IN RECENT YEARS. THANKFULLY CALIFORNIA HAS NOT BEEN AMONG THEM. UNDER EXISTING CALIFORNIA LAW MUNICIPAL POLICE CHIEFS AND COUNTY SHERIFF'S MAY ISSUE CCW LICENSES TO RESIDENTS OF THEIR JURISDICTION IF THE LICENSING AUTHORITY DETERMINES THAT THE APPLICANT IS A GOOD MORAL CHARACTER. AND THAT GOOD CAUSE EXISTS FOR ISSUING LICENSE. THIS LEGISLATION WE CAN THESE REQUIREMENTS BY INSTEAD MANDATING THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT APPROVED THESE APPLICATIONS IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES. IT ALSO FUNCTIONALLY REPEAL STATE LAWS GOOD CAUSE REQUIREMENT BY REQUIRING LICENSING AUTHORITIES TO ACCEPT. AN APPLICANT'S QUOTE STATED COULD CAUSE WITH ADDITIONAL INQUIRY. IF HE OR SHE STATES THAT THEY DESIRE CCW LICENSE FOR SELF DEFENSE OR CRIME PREVENTION PURPOSES. THIS BILL WOULD AFFIRMATIVELY PREVENT LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM REQUIRING ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE FROM SUCH APPLICANTS REGARDING ANY SPECIFIC A UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES PERTAINING TO THE COURT STATED COULD CAUSE. BECAUSE THIS BILL WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKEN LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO PROTECT THE COMMUNITIES. WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. THANK YOU. A GOOD MORNING AMANDA WILCOX HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. I WILL BE BRIEF. THIS CONCEPT HAS BEEN BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. MANY MANY TIMES AND IT HAS FAILED EACH TIME AND. I SHOULD DO SO AGAIN THE KEY QUESTION THAT THIS LEGISLATION PRESENTS AS SHE CALIFORNIA. MOVE FROM BEING AND MAY ISSUE. OUR CCW STATE TO A SHALL ISSUE IN UNDER THE SHALL ISSUE SCHEME LAW ENFORCEMENT ESSENTIALLY WOULD LOSE THEIR DISCRETION ON DETERMINING WHO CAN CARRY A LOADED HIDDEN. GUN IN PUBLIC UP WE BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN. S. QUESTION AREN'T REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT TO HAVE A SPECIFIC IDENTIFIED THREAT. INSTEAD TO JUST ARE ALLOWED TO BE GENERAL. SELF DEFENSE WHICH SOMETIMES MEANS I'M ON TO CARRY GUNS IN PUBLIC THAT IS NOT AND GOOD ENOUGH REASON. UP CONSIDERING THE RISKS INVOLVED WITH HAVING MORE LOADED HITTING GUNS HONORS IN OUR STREETS AND IN OUR CITIES IN CALIFORNIA. NO CREDIBLE STATISTICAL EVIDENCE EXISTS TO SHOW THAT PERMISSIVE CARRY LAWS REDUCE CRIME IN FACT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT PERMISSIVE CCW LAWS MAY ACTUALLY INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF SOME TYPES OF CRIME. AND I WOULD JUST THAT BAD IF MORE GUNS REALLY RESULTED IN LESS CRIME THAN THE UNITED STATES SHOULD BE THE SAFEST COUNTRY IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD. IT IS NOT. I URGE YOU TO OPPOSE THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY. HELLO I'M SABRINA CHRIS SAID HE WITH ALL OF US ARE NINE IN STRONG OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. PARTY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SENIOR NON. YOU MAY CLOSE. WHAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL TODAY AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE WITNESSES YOU CAME TO TESTIFY TODAY? VERY OFTEN WE ARE ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THIS ISSUE BUT I CERTAINLY RESPECT YOUR POINT OF VIEW. I WILL SAY THOUGH I WANT TO POINT OUT A FEW FLIES IN THE TESTIMONY OF THE OPPOSITION AND THAT IS THAT IT WOULD WEAKEN LAW ENFORCEMENT'S ABILITY TO SCREEN. PEOPLE. IN AND DECIDE WHO IS. WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET THESE PERMITS AM THAT IS FALSE? BECAUSE THEY STILL HAD TO GO THROUGH A BACKGROUND CHECK THEY STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL OF THE OTHER STANDARDS THAT ARE REQUIRED RIGHT NOW FOR C. CW'S. SO THAT IS JUST FLATLY FALSE. I THIS IS I WILL REMIND EVERYONE AGAIN A RIGHT. TO OWN A WEAPON NINETY PRIVILEGE. I NOTICED ALSO THAT THERE WAS TWICE. THE PHRASE. LOADED HIDDEN GUN IN PUBLIC. WHICH SOUNDS VERY SINISTER TIMMY AM PERHAPS THAT'S BY DESIGN BUT LET'S REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AMERICANS WHO HAVE CARRIED A LOADED HIDDEN GUIDE IN PUBLIC AND ACTUALLY SAVED LIVES AND I'D. I WOULD CHALLENGE YOU TO GIVE ME. I DON'T A HANDFUL ANVIL OF CASES IN WHICH A CCW HOLDER. COMMITTED HARM AGAINST ANOTHER FELLOW HUMAN BEING WITH THAT LOADED HIDDEN GUN. THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND WE KNOW THAT CCW HOLDERS ARE ARE AMONG THE MOST LAW ABIDING WHEN IT COMES TO GUN OWNERSHIP. WE KNOW THAT THOSE ARE FACTS. THOSE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT THE PEOPLE WE ARE MORE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT ARE THE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE GUNS. MY REQUEST IS VERY SIMPLE IF THEY CAN PASS THE BACKGROUND CHECK IF THEY ARE OF GOOD MORAL CHARACTER AND BECAUSE AND STANDING BY THEIR LOCAL SHERIFF'S. THEY SHOULD BE ISSUED A CCW PERMIT ITS ACTIVE UP THERE SOMETHING IN THE RECORD. THAT SHOULD KEEP THEM FROM BEING ABLE TO POSSESS THAT WEAPON WITH THE CCW. THEN SO BE IT BUT I THINK THIS IS RIDICULOUS TO ALLOW FIFTY DIFFERENT COUNTIES TO ASSIGN DIFFERENT STANDARDS. AND IT NO CONTINUITY ACROSS THE BOARD FOR WHO CAN HOLD A CCW PERMIT AND WHO CANNOT. I JUST THINK THAT'S WRONG THIS IS AGAIN THIS IS A RIGHT IT IS NOT A PRIVILEGE. WITH THAT I WOULD ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. AND DANK UNITE AND NO YOU. YOUR PASSION ABOUT DESIGN YOU BROUGHT JUST BEFORE AND ALL OF TOLD YOU. THAT ARE EXTREMELY PROUD OF THE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. UMPIRES ARE CALIFORNIA CC W. PERMIT HOLDERS. I'LL DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER GROUP THAT HAS A ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. POLICY. WOULD IS NO PROPS WE HAVEN'T HAD ANY PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA CCW HOLDERS AND I THINK BECAUSE ASSIST EXISTING. SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE AND WINDED WAY LAW ENFORCEMENT HANDLE SINK YES. I EVEN MIGHT EVEN MY COUNTY WE'VE HAD. SOME CCW HOLDERS BECAUSE OF POLITICAL REASONS THAT WERE ISSUED DUMP. IT'S STILL CARRY WEAPONS PERMITS BUT EVEN THEN. WE HAVE HAD ANY INCIDENTS THAT I KNOW OF HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO UP MY NOSE MORE OF LET'S NOT. NEXT I CHANGE SOMETHING A FORMULA THAT IS WORKING EXTREMELY WELL THERE'S PROBABLY GOOD REASONS WHY IT SACRAMENTO THERE'S MORE CCW HOLDERS ARE PERMITS LET OUT. THEN CAP AND IN LOS ANGELES THEY MAY BE VERY GOOD REASONS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT NO. AGAIN I PROVING AIR ON THE SIDE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THEY KNOW BETTER THAN I DO ABOUT WHO SHOULD HAVE CCW. PERMIT AND WHO SHOULD NOT AND SO UP AGAIN GRETA BILLY AND I KNOW YOU YOU FEEL PASSION ABOUT IT AND I. AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR PASSION. BUT I I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE SOMETHING THAT IS. WORK WHERE PERFECTION CCW LAWS WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THAT JUST AUTOMATICALLY ASK FOR IT BUT NO OF WELL I HAVEN'T GOTTEN IT MOTION CHAIRMAN QUIRK CUT THOUGH IT WE'RE DONE. WORK WELL AS A COURTESY TO A COLLEAGUE I WOULD ASK THAT I DID JUST MAKE IT UNDONE NO COMMENT WHAT YOU THAT. EVERY MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE WHEN THEY GO TO A PUBLIC EVENT PLEASE DON'T TURN OFF MY MICROPHONE WOULD DONE THAT. EVERY MEMBER IN THIS LEGISLATURE WHO GOES TO A PUBLIC EVENT AS SOMEONE THERE WITH A GUN TO PROTECT BATTLE AND OTHER CALIFORNIAN SHOULD HAVE THAT RIGHT AS WELL. THE SECOND IN. ON A. B.

THE MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE GLENN BACCHUS ON BEHALF OF DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE. WHEN WE FIRST SAT DOWN TO ANALYZE THIS BILL WE GET RECOGNIZE IT WITH A NEW TASK FORCE THAT WAS STACKED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. PERSONNEL LONG FORCED AND REPRESENTATIVES WHO OPPOSED PROP SIXTY FOUR OPPOSED ALMA BUT WE THOUGHT PERHAPS. IF YOU'RE. FAVOR. POST. WE THOUGHT PERHAPS THE COMMITTEE COULD BE. THAT NEW TASK FORCE WE BALANCED TO ADD SOME. PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS OTHER STUDENTS IN THE CONTROL. PRESS. BUT THEN AS WE REVIEWED ALMA THE PROP SIXTY FOUR WE REALIZE THAT WE'RE SPENDING. TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR TO DO WHAT THIS ACT. DESCRIBES. THIS ACT WANTS TO INCREASE. THEY WERE IN THE BILL AS ATTACKS ON ILLEGAL MARIJUANA. BUT. PROP SIXTY FOUR ARE HE SPENDS TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR. ON STATE PERSONNEL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO ATTACK ILLEGAL MARIJUANA IT HASN'T EVEN BEEN GIVEN A CHANCE TO REALLY RAISE REVENUE AND MATURE AND OPERATE. BUT THE ACT ITSELF. CREATES.

NUMBER OF MARIJUANA PLANTS INVESTIGATORS SUSPECT THE FIRE WAS CAUSED BY THE ILLEGAL MODIFICATION OF ELECTRICAL PANELS. TWO CHILDREN PRESENT AT THE HOME WERE TAKEN THE PRICKS CUSTODY WHILE BOTH PARENTS WERE ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF FELONY CHILD ENDANGERMENT.

AB THREE TO AWAY IT'S A NARAL BILL AND A NARAL PROBLEM FOR A LIMITED TIME BASIS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE. WITH ME TODAY IS. A CAPTAIN TIM O'BRIEN VEAL GROW POLICE DEPARTMENT. AND WE'VE ALSO GOT FOLKS FROM CITY SACRAMENTO FABLES AND KENNEDY PRESIDENT SACKED SOUTHEAST VILLAGE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION. INTERMINGLE PRESIDENT THE AVONDALE WHEN ELDER NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION. YES WHEN THE REWRITING REPORT MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OUT MY NAME IS TIM ALBRIGHT NAM A CAPTAIN WITH THE APPROPRIATION PERMIT. AS PART OF MY DUTIES I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO OVERSEE OUR INVESTIGATIONS UNIT. WHICH INCLUDES OUR NARCOTICS UNIT. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX OUR CITY HAS BEEN COMBAT IN THE PROLIFERATION OF ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROW HOMES WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. OUR LAST TWELVE YEARS WE HAVE DISMANTLED HUNDREDS OF ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROW HOMES ONLY TO SEE THEM REAPPEAR. ON NEW RESIDENTIAL STREETS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY. THIS CYCLICAL PRESENCE OF ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROW HOMES WITHIN THE CITY VELCRO. AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND COMPROMISES PUBLIC SAFETY FOR OUR CITIZENS. THESE PROPERTIES POSE SIGNIFICANT FIRE SAFETY HAZARDS. I AND ATTRACT A CRIMINAL ELEMENT TO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. AS YOU'RE AWARE THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR ALLOWS FOR SMALL AMOUNTS OF MARIJUANA TO BE GROWN FOR PERSONAL USE. ALTHOUGH WHAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING OAK GROVE IS FAR DIFFERENT. WE ARE EXPERIENCING SOPHISTICATED INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE ENGAGING. IN LARGE SCALE ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROWS. AND THEN EXPORTING THAT YIELD ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. THIS IS THE TYPE OF ILLEGAL OPERATION TARGETED UNDER THIS LEGISLATION. LAST YEAR TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT THE ELK GROVE POLICE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE. ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE CALLS FOR SERVICE INVOLVING THE AFOREMENTIONED ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROWS. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALONE THEY'LL GROW POLICE DEPARTMENT DISMANTLED FORTY ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROW OPERATIONS. WE ARE ON PACE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO FAR EXCEED THAT NUMBER. WHAT THE OVERSIGHT OF DUE PROCESS A. B. THIRTY TWO OH EIGHT WILL PROVIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH ANOTHER VERY USEFUL TOOL TO PROTECT OUR RESIDENTS? AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE WITHIN OUR CITY. OUR BALANCED APPROACH ALLOWS FOR LAWFUL MARIJUANA GROW OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO TAKE PLACE. WHILE TARGETING THE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED UNSAFE AND ILLEGAL GROW OPERATIONS WHICH COMPROMISE THE SAFETY AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU TO A SETTLEMENT COOPER FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS BILL. AND THE CITY OF OAK GROVE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON A. B. THIRTY TO AWAIT THANK YOU.

MY STREET MADE HISTORY ON APRIL FOURTH MIGHT ONE OF MY CROSS THE STREET NEIGHBORS WAS ONE OF THE ILLEGAL. OF GROW HOUSES THAT WAS TARGETED BY THE FBI I CAME HOME BETWEEN MEETINGS ONLY TO BE STOPPED BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE F. B. I. I COULD NOT ENTER MY STREET. BECAUSE THE HOUSE DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM ME WAS THE ILLEGAL GROW HOUSE I WAS SHOCKED. BUT NOT SURPRISED IT IS ONLY. THAT HOUSE ON APRIL FOURTH AND IN TWO YEARS AGO HOUSE DIRECTLY ACOSTA ST FOR ME WHICH WE SUSPECT IT WAS ALSO LEAGUE A LIVE. IT ILLEGAL GROW HOUSE BOTH HOMES WERE LOCATED ONE BLOCK FROM A LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE PARK. IN OUR COMMUNITY GARDEN WHICH WE ENJOY. BOTH HOMES SIT SAT. THINK WE SORT. CRIME BLIGHTED UP. THE GARAGE DOORS WERE REMOVED NOW WE'RE WORKING WITH TRYING TO FIND OWNERS OF THE HOME. TO. TO REMOVE THAT. ALSO WOULD WE FACE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD I LIVE IN. IS NOT ONLY ILLEGAL GROW HOMES BUT ALSO A LARGE NUMBER OF LEGAL MARIJUANA BUSINESSES. DISTRICT SIX IN PARTICULARLY HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL GROW HOMES. GOING ON THAT'S REALLY INFECTING OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IN WE'RE VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT IT SO WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL AND LIKE THAT THINK ASSEMBLYMAN COOPER FOR SPONSORING IT.

OKAY. ALL FLOOR YOU HAVE ALL THREE OF YOU HAVE FOUR MINUTES OR. OKAY. HOW I AM ELLEN COMP WITH CALIFORNIA NORMAL NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR THE REFORM OF MARIJUANA LAWS WERE MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION? WE GOT FOR FUTURE REFORM AT THE STATE LEVEL BECAUSE OF THE ABUSES OF FORFEITURE IT HAPPENS WITHOUT DUE PROCESS BEFORE A PERSON IS CONVICTED. EVERYTHING IS SEIZE THAT THEY OWN IF WE START OPENING UP FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO WILL TO DO FORFEITURE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE'RE GONNA SEE TERRIBLE ABUSES ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE CITIES AND COUNTIES. ARE PASSING VERY PUNITIVE LAWS AGAINST GROWING EVEN SMALL AMOUNTS OF MARIJUANA WITH HUGE FINES INVOLVED PUTTING LIENS ON PEOPLE'S HOUSES. FOR FUTURE IF IF THE CARTOONS OPERATIONS THEY'RE DESCRIBING COULD BE FORFEITED ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS A HUNDRED HOUSES JUST HAVE BEEN IN SACRAMENTO WE DON'T NEED THE LOCALS TO HAVE THIS KIND OF POWER THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST MIKE THAT DOCTOR OFF ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA HERE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO A. B. THIRTY TWO OO EIGHT. THIS BILL SEEKS TO CIRCUMVENT THE CRITICAL DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS THE LEGISLATURE PUT IN PLACE LESS THAN TWO YEARS AGO WHEN IT PASSED S. B. FOUR FOUR THREE. SENATOR MITCHELL'S ASSET FORFEITURE REFORM BILL INSTEAD THE SPELL BREATHES NEW LIFE INTO CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE OF REMNANT OF THE FAILED WAR ON DRUGS AND AT A TIME WHEN THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS SEEKING TO REINVIGORATE THE PROGRAM. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AS MANY OF YOU REMEMBER THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AS BEFORE FOR THREE. IT WAS A BILL DESIGNED TO CURB ABUSES OF THE ASSET FORFEITURE PROCESS AND IT WAS DESIGNED TO CURB ABUSES THAT FELL DISPROPORTIONATELY ON. LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR AT THE HEART OF AS BEFORE FOR THREE IT WAS THE REQUIREMENT THAT BEFORE THE GOVERNMENTCAN PERMANENTLY TAKE AWAY SOMEBODY'S PROPERTY. THERE MUST BE A CONVICTION AND AN UNDERLYING CRIMINAL CASE. S. BEFORE FOR THREE RECEIVED BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND THE FINAL BILL THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED WAS THE RESULT OF SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATIONS THAT RESULTED IN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION THE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION AND THE POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION ALL REMOVING THEIR OPPOSITION. AB THIRTY TWO EIGHT SEEKS TO UNDO ALL OF THAT WORK BY PERMITTING THE CITY OF ELK GROVE TO BYPASS STATE LAW. AND CONFISCATE AND SEEK AN ORDER OF FORFEITURE FOR ANY PERSONAL OR REAL PROPERTY WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING A CONVICTION. INVESTIGATIONS HAVE CONSISTENTLY FOUND THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AT RISK OF HAVING THEIR PROPERTY TAKEN BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PUT INTO THE ASSET FORFEITURE PROCESS. AND THAT LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE ALSO PARTICULARLY HARD HIT. BY A CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE BECAUSE THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO CARRY CASH FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THE SPELLING ASK YOU TO VOTE NOW. THANK YOU. CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS CRAIG PAGE WITH A CALIFORNIA LAND TITLE ASSOCIATION. WE REPRESENT THE TITLE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA WERE ALSO IN OPPOSITION. WE WERE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO CONCERNS THE WORD THAT WERE RAISED EARLIER BY THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL NAY AUTHOR. AND WHY WE THINK IT'S WELL INTENDED WE THINK THE SWEEPING IMPACT OF THIS IS PRETTY PROFOUND. OF THE SINCE LEAGUE SEEDINGS STATE CONTROL CONSTITUTIONAL. OVERSIGHT TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT WERE BASED ON LANGUAGE IS PRETTY VAGUE UNITS AND TEN. AND I KNOW THAT THEIR OR OR THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN AND I KNOW THAT THEIR IT'S INTENDED TO TO TARGET SPECIFICALLY GROW HOUSES. THE WAY IT'S CURRENTLY DRAFTED WOULD BE A VIOLATION OF ANY ORDINANCE IN THE CITY OF. A VELCRO. ANECDOTALLY WE HAD A GROUSE ACROSS MY IN MY HOUSE WHERE I LIVE IT DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT WAS THERE. AND WHEN THEY FINALLY FOUND IT HELL WHEN THE WHEN THE ATTENDANCE FLED. OF THEY HAD TO DO TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS REPAIR WORK AND IT WAS A NEIGHBOR THAT I KNEW SO HE WAS HE WAS AN INNOCENT LANDHOLDER. WHO DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THERE WAS A GROW HOUSE IN HIS IN HIS ARM? IN HIS HOME AND I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY IN MANY CASES THEY'RE GOING TO BE INNOCENT LAND LANDLORDS WERE PROVIDING. HOMES TO PEOPLE IN MANY CASES FROM A LOW INCOME. WORD OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WILL NOT KNOWING AND NOT HAVING THE ABILITY TO MONITOR THEIR OWN HOMES THEY CAN'T TELL WHETHER THIS CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. AND TO BE ABLE TO COME AND SWEEP AND SEIZE THEIR HOMES I THINK IS IS A IS A IS A STRETCH AND AND AND AND UNFORTUNATE. EXPANSION OF THE LOCAL POWER. A WE WOULD. WE WE THINK THAT THE EARLIER BILL. WITH THE TASK FORCE TARGETING THIS MORE SPECIFICALLY AND FOCUSING ON HOW CAN WE. DO THIS IS IS A BETTER WAY TO TO HANDLE THIS AND SEAL TAY'S IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING GOING BACK IT'S OUR DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE WE WORKED WITH THE INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE ACO YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER HADLEY IN SENATOR MITCHELL'S WE AUTHORS OF THE BILLS THAT RECEIVED OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. TO BETTER CONTROL. CIVIL ASSET FORFEITURE INCOME LAST SUPPORT DURING THE STATE. WE DO NOT WANT TO GO BACKWARDS ONE. TOWN AT A TIME ALLOWING HOMES CARS CASH JEWELRY. TO BE TAKEN WITHOUT DUE PROCESS WITHOUT A CONVICTION. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO VOTE. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES OPPOSITION NAME AN ORGANIZATION. TIFFANY RIGHT WITH THE SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION IN OPPOSITION FOR ALL THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED THINKING. THANK YOU. JIM WEINBERG ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION OF CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION. CAROL STRICT MEN. ON BEHALF OF LEGAL SERVICES FOR PRISONERS WITH CHILDREN IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. OUR ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE MOST COOPER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I THINK IT'S VERY INTERESTING SO THE STATEMENTS THAT WERE MADE. THIS IS ORGANIZED CRIME IS NOT STREET LEVEL DRUG DEALERS AS YOU KNOW THESE HOMES. ELOISE HOMES ARE BOUGHT BY ORGANIZED CRIME ON THE EAST COAST IN NEW YORK. BEING OUT CHINESE IMMIGRANTS. THE FARM IS HOUSES ARE PUTTING TYPICALLY UNDER THOUSAND DOLLARS DOWN ON THE HOUSES. NICK INVERTING AND INDOOR GROW SO IT IS ORGANIZED CRIME AND IT WAS ALSO INTERESTING IN THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO. FOR THAT ONE DISTRICT DISTRICT SIX THEIR SIXTY SIX THOUSAND RESIDENTS PRIMARILY PEOPLE OF COLOR AND OVER ONE THOUSAND ROLES IN THAT AREA. IN THE CANNELLA GRILL THE NUMBER OF GIRLS KNOW GROVER BEEN QUITE A BIT QUITE A BIT. EVERYONE THESE ONCE THE TESTIFIED HAS NOT COME TO MY OFFICE TO OFFER. LANGUAGE TO AND TAKE AMENDMENT SIR OFFER SUGGESTIONS ON HOW TO DO THIS BUT IT IS AFFECTING THE RESIDENTS OF SACRAMENTO IT HAS BEEN FIFTEEN RISEN SECOND FOR SOMETIME NOW. AND. THERE'S DUE PROCESS IS BUILT INTO THE BILL. AND THAT'S WITH A BIG ISSUE AND ALSO WITH THIS PRODUCT. CALIFORNIA HAS A LEGAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY WHERE THERE'S TRACK AND TRACE IT IS TESTED TO MEASURES NOT PESTICIDES SO WE DON'T WANT MARIJUANA GOT GOING OUT. TO HAVE RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT IS DANGEROUS AND SELL ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY AND HEALTH AND THAT'S OUR CONCERN WITH THAT SO WE SAY THAT AND ONE GERMAN TALKED ABOUT HOUSES BEING FEES FIRST OF ALL. NOT GONNA SEE THE HOUSE FROM SOMEONE WHO'S ILLEGITIMATE HOMEOWNER USER BEING BOUGHT BY STRAW OWNERS FOR THAT SO WHEN THAT INDIVIDUAL GET PER SE THAT'S JULIE DISINGENUOUS. WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS THE DISTRICT BILL THE FOR THE CITY SACRAMENTO? TESTIFIED OF THIS IS AN ISSUE WITH THEM. SIMILAR GERA IS OFFICES HERE THAT CONCERNS THEM YOU'VE HAD A REPRESENT OF LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT COME FORT AND TESTIFY. AND TALK ABOUT THE ISSUES NO GROWTH IS RAMPANT NOT TO MENTION THE FIRE ISSUE BECAUSE THEY RE WIRE THE HOUSES. BECAUSE THE HIGH POWER DEMAND NOT TO MENTION. THE DRUG REPULSIVE HAD WE'VE SEEN HERE YOUR REPORT FROM THE FED CITY HERE SAYS SACRAMENTO'S GROUND ZERO SACRAMENTO GROVE AREA. SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL INDOOR GROWS IN THIS COUNTRY. CAME OUT THESE AREAS THESE FOLKS NEED AN OPTION. TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS IN FIX SIX. SO TO ME WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT ASSET FORFEITURE THIS IS APPLES TO ORANGES COMPARISON IS THERE ORGANIZED CRIME FOLKS WHO ARE DOING THIS IS NOT A MOM AND POP INTO OPERATION. ON THE THE DOCUMENTATION THERE TO PROVE THAT SO. I GUESS WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS WE DO SOMETHING FEES RESIDENTS ARE BEING AFFECTED BY THESE AREAS THE DOROTHY DAY IN AND DAY OUT AND IS DANGEROUS. SO WE NEED OPTION THIS IS AN OPTION TO DEAL WITH IT AND REALLY HIT THESE FOLKS WORDS HURTING. NOT TALK ABOUT TIME HERE. IT'S TO HIM WHERE HURTS IN THE POCKETBOOK. AND I IT COMES BACK TO ORGANIZED CRIME MEANS YOU'RE NOT STREET DEALERS WITH THIS. SO IS FULFILL APPEARANCE THEY WOULD EVERYONE. AND THEIR AGAINST EVERYTHING BUT YOU DON'T LIVE IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS IN OUR PERSONS OF COLOR IT DOES NOT AFFECT YOU HAVE THE HOMEOWNER HER TALK ABOUT IT AFTER AMERICAN LEVI'S HER NEIGHBORHOOD. PREDOMINATELY AFRICAN AMERICAN THEY DEAL WITH IT DAY IN AND DAY OUT THEY DON'T DRIVE HOME TO SOME RICH NEIGHBORHOOD AND SIT THERE. SO THAT'S MY BIG ISSUE WITH THIS. LET'S HELP PEOPLE TO HELP THEM AND RULE INTO TO TRY AND. FIX THE BILL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES BUT IT IT'S WORTH IT. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. OKAY AND. I DO NOT SEE SEE YOUR YOUR PASSION. ON NOV SEE YOU. YOU WILL DO ONE PROTECT YOUR COMMUNITY AND I ADMIRE YOU FOR THAT. THIS IS A STATEWIDE PROBLEM. THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPORTING YOUR ILLEGAL MARIJUANA TASK FORCE BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE. POLICY ON THIS. I MAY BE ONE OF THE FEW. THAT ALSO BELIEVED IT ASSET FORFEITURE. WHEN IT COMES TO ILLEGAL CANNABIS MIGHT BE AN EFFECTIVE WEAPON. AND GETTING RID OF THE ILLEGAL. MARIJUANA BUSINESSES AND CALIFORNIA. RECYCLING MARIJUANA BECAUSE I DON'T UPGRADE INTO CANNABIS THAT'S HOW MUCH I DISLIKED ILLEGAL. I'M AFTER AMERICAN. I HAD THE SAME PROBLEM MY DISTRICT IN LOS ANGELES A HUNDRED THREE LEGAL ONES OVER EIGHTEEN HUNDRED ILLEGAL. SELECT CROSSES ALL COMMUNITIES ALL COLORS. EVERYONE'S AFFECTED BY THE ILLEGAL CANNABIS MARKET RIGHT NOW. AND SO ON. I THINK THIS THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE I DO WE MAY HAVE A POTENTIALLY WE WILL EVENTUALLY GET. TO AN EFFECTIVE ARM PROGRAM OF GETTING RID OF ILLEGAL YOU LIVE YOU TALK ABOUT THE TASK FORCE ALONG WITH MISTER LACKEY. WITHIN THE BOTTOM. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO ALSO DEAL WITH IT BECAUSE IT IS AN EMERGENCY AND NEED TO BE DEALT WITH. NOW NOT NEXT WEEK. NOW. AND. UNTIL WE. CREATE JUST TASK FORCE INTO WE COME UP WITH SOME. SOME A PLAN THAT WILL NOT HARM PEOPLE WHO ARE INNOCENT. THAT THE MONIES THAT YOUR OFFICERS. ULTIMATELY WILL GET FROM THIS WILL GO BACK TO COMBATING CANNABIS AND MAYBE SOME GO BACK TO COMBATING. ON DRUG ABUSE OF TO WE FIGURE OUT HOW WE DO THAT WITH ASSET MANAGEMENT UNFORTUNATE TO RECOMMEND A NO VOTE. I BELIEVE WE ARE WE DON'T WANT THE RIGHT TRACK. WITH THIS BUT WE'VE WE'VE GOT TO DO WE'VE GOT LOOSE MORE PLANNING AND I THINK. YOUR AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY IS OF LITTLE WAITED TO GET US THERE. IS THERE A MOTION. IT'S HELD IN COMMITTEE FOR LACK DILEMMA. AFTER RECONSIDERATION. EXCERPTED ACCEPTABLE WOULD WITHOUT A VOTE SO I HAVE. FONG. IF YOU GO. THE LAST YEAR. I KNOW I BELIEVE A LITTLE BIT. IT THANK YOU MISTER FUNG FOR FOR FOR GREEN TO TESTIMONY ONLY I. ABSOLUTE TO GIVE ME CHAIR REALLY APPRECIATE CYPRESS OUTLOOK FOR WORKING WITH THE U. S. US ON THIS BILL. BUT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY FOUR WHICH HOLDS DUI OFFENDERS ACCOUNTABLE ENSURING THAT A PRIOR FELONY DUI CONVICTION. EVEN IF IT IS A WAY TO REDUCE A MISDEMEANOR REMAINS A FELONY FOR PURPOSES OF THE TERMINATION OF A SUBSEQUENT DUI OFFENSE. BY THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION. A MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING THE KERN COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE AND MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS. EVERY YEAR THOUSANDS OF LIVES ARE NEEDLESSLY LOSS IN DO YOU AYE RELATED ACCIDENTS. AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN ALONE ONE THOUSAND FIFTY NINE CALIFORNIANS LOST THEIR LIVES TO DRUNK DRIVING ACCIDENTS. AN ASTOUNDING AND TRAGIC REALITY. SINCE POINTS AND NINETY PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED INCURRING COUNTY DO YOU DO TO TEA Y. RELATED ACCIDENTS. A MOTHER AND DAUGHTER DIED AT THE HANDS OF REPEAT DO YOU AYE OFFENDER JUST LAST YEAR BAKERSFIELD. AND THERE ARE TRAGEDIES LIKE THIS HAPPENING THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. CURRENT LAW HAS ALLOWED REPEAT OFFENDERS TO EVADE PENALTIES DESIGNED TO CLAMP DOWN ON INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE REPEAT YOU AYE OFFENDERS. WITH A NUMBER OF REPEAT YOU WIFE UNDERSTANDING AT OVER TWENTY SIX PERCENT OF ALL CASES. IS CRITICAL THAT THIS LOOPHOLE IS CLOSE. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW ORIGINAL FELONY CONVICTIONS TO STAND AS FELONIES IN LIGHT OFNEW DO YOU Y. VIOLATIONS. EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN SUBSEQUENTLY REDUCED TO MISDEMEANORS THIS WILL HOLD REPEAT TO YOU Y. OFFENDERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND HELP SAVE LIVES. NOW AFTER SPEAKING WITH THE COMMITTEE IN MY STAFF I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE NARROWING IN CLARIFYING THIS BILL TO ONLY CAPTURE DO YOU WISER ORIGINALLY CHARGED AS A FELONY. AND ARE LATER REDUCED TO A MISDEMEANOR. NOT IDEA WHY THAT IS ORIGINALLY CHARGED A MISDEMEANOR. IT NOW WITH ME TO TESTIFY AND AND AND THE PRESENT IN SUPPORT ISSUES IN PRICE FROM THE ORANGE COUNTY JUST RETURNEES. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE THANK YOU I AM A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR OFFERING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN THIS BILL A LITTLE BIT FURTHER. I'M I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT THE APPLICATION OF THIS BILL IS ACTUALLY A VERY NARROW APPLICATION IT ONLY APPLIES TO SITUATIONS WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL HAS PLAYED TO AND BEEN CONVICTED OF AND SENTENCED TO A FELONY. THEY GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF REHABILITATION COMPLETING THE OBJECTIVES OF THEIR SENTENCE ONCE THEY'VE COMPLETED THAT THEY WILL GO BACK TO THE COURT AND ASK FOR A REDUCTION TO A MISDEMEANOR SO THAT THEIR RECORD NO LONGER REFLECTS A FELONY. THAT'S A GOOD THING WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE THAT AND WE WANT COURTS TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO REDUCE THOSE FELONIES TO A MISDEMEANOR FOR ALL PURPOSES TO ALLOW AN INCENTIVIZE REHABILITATION. HOWEVER IN THE ONE AREA WHERE THE FELONY WON'T BE REDUCED TO A MISDEMEANOR IT WILL BE REDUCED TO MISDEMEANOR AND ALL OTHER AREAS BUT IF THE PERSON. IF THE PERSON SHOULD PICK UP A NEW D. Y. OFFENSE THEN THE PRIOR FELONY EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN REDUCED TO A MISDEMEANOR WILL STILL BE CONSIDERED A FELONY FOR THE PURPOSE OF CHARGING THE NEW DO YOU WHY. AND THAT IS COME CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS. CONSISTENTLY FOR DECADES FELT IS IMPORTANT WHICH IS. OF LOOKING AT RECIDIVISM AND THE HIGH RATE OF RECIDIVISM INDIE Y. FATALITIES AND ADDRESSING THOSE AND CURBING THOSE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WHAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS SAID IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO TREAT REPEAT OFFENDERS. DIFFERENTLY AND ENHANCED PENALTIES FOR REPEAT OFFENDERS INDIE Y. CASES THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW US TO CLOSE A LOOPHOLE THAT AGAIN WOULD ONLY APPLY TO A NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNT OF INDIVIDUALS. IF THE CASE IS TRIED AS A FELONY TO BEGIN WITH AND CHARGES OF FELONY DUI TO BEGIN WITH IT'S USUALLY SUCH AN ELEVATED CRIME THAT IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE REDUCED TO A MISDEMEANOR ANYWAY. BUT IN THE RARE SITUATION WHERE THE COURT WILL USEITS DISCRETION AND REWARD REHABILITATION AND PROGRAMMING WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL RECEIVES IN THEIR LIFE THAT THEY CAN GO ON AND HAVE AND A RAP SHEET THAT'S FREE OF THE FELONY THAT THEY CAN HAVE A PLAYMATE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY REBUILD THEIR LIVES. THIS ONLY KICKS AND IF THEY PICK UP A NEW DIY IF THEY PICK UP A NEW DEAL AYE THEN THE DA WILL BE ABLE TO CHARGE THE NEAT NEW DIY AS A FELONY. BECAUSE THE INDIVIDUAL IS A REPEAT OFFENDER WHO WAS ONCE CONVICTED OF A FELONY DE WHY IT'S A VERY NARROW LOOPHOLE IT WILL HAVE A NEGLIGIBLE FISCAL AND PRACTICAL IMPACT BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH A LOW NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHO QUALIFY FOR THIS MOST PEOPLE WHO GET THEIR SEVENTEEN BE AND GET THEIR REAP TO THEIR CRIME REDUCED FROM MISDEMEANOR ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE LEARNED AN IMPORTANT LIFE LESSON WHO ARE NOT REPEAT OFFENDERS THAT'S WHY THE COURT IS WILLING TO REDUCE THEM? SO WE ASK THE COMMITTEE TO PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THIS IS THIS IS NOT A A BILL THAT'S ENHANCING SENTENCES OR PUNISHING PEOPLE HARSHLY THIS IS A BILL THAT IS SQUARE IN LINE WITH THE IT INTENT OF THIS LEGISLATURE. IN TREATING REPEAT DI Y. OFFENDERS DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF DUI FATALITIES THAT WE SEE BECAUSE BY REPEAT TO YOU AYE OFFENDERS AGAIN THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE IN THE PAST. THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE FOR THAT NEGLIGIBLE NUMBER OF AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS IS AT MOST EIGHTEEN MONTHS BUT IT'S UNLIKELY THAT THEY WOULD GET EIGHTEEN MONTHS IT WOULD LIKELY IF THEY DIDN'T GET PROBATION AND WERE SENTENCED TO PRISON. GET THAT MID TERM OF ADDITIONAL YEAR AGAIN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND NEGLIGIBLE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THIS IS A VERY VERY SMALL LOOPHOLE DE WIFE FELONIES ARE RARELY DO REDUCED TO A MISDEMEANOR. THAT RARE SITUATION WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL HAS DEMONSTRATED PROGRAMMING AND REHABILITATION THE COURT SHOULD HAVE THE DISCRETION TO REWARD THAT PERSON WITH A MISDEMEANOR BUT SOCIETY SHOULD NOT BE HARMED BY HAVING THAT REPEAT DI Y. OFFENDER BE CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR THE SECOND TIME AROUND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COURTESY. AND INDULGING ME IN MY COMMENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE INDIA WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. TIFFANY MAP IS ONLY HALF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. I ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING. MARCO GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION I APOLOGIZE FOR MY VOICE THURMOND WILL HORSE THIS MORNING. THIS BILL IS ALMOST AN EXACT REWRITE OF SB SIXTY SEVEN WHICH DIED IN COMMITTEE LAST YEAR. AND. WE OPPOSE THIS BILL BECAUSE AT ONE TIES JUDGE'S HANDS JUDGES HAVE DISCRETION. TO AS ON. THAT PROPONENTS SAID SEVENTEEN BE UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION SEVENTEEN BE. REDUCED SO. A WHAT IS KNOWN AS A WAFFLER TO A MISDEMEANOR. AND FELONIES THAT ARE CHARGED AS FELONIES. ON THEM GO TO A PRELIMINARY HEARING AND ASK THAT HEARING THE JUDGE HEARS THE EVIDENCE. AND HAS THE DISCRETION AT THAT POINT TO REDUCE THE OFFENSE TO A MISDEMEANOR. BASED ON THE FACTS OF THE CASE. SO BAD THIS IS NOT JUST REDUCING IT AFTER SOMEONE HAS BEEN CONVICTED THIS IS SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY HERE'S THE EVIDENCE AND FEELS THAT. THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE OUTCOME. YOU KNOW I'M NOT SURE IF THE BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED IF IT HAS THE MONEY APPLAUD BAT BUT THE WAY IT WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IT WAS ACTUALLY. PRECLUDED. THE JUDGE. REDUCING IT AT THAT POINT. IT TIES THE JUDGE'S HANDS AND IT SAYS. AHLAM IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN CHARGED WITH A FELONY DUI. AND TEN YEARS LATER YOU GET CHARGED WITH THE NEW FELONY DE. VIGNETTE YOU WILL BE PUNISHED WITH A FELONY. AND THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE. IT GIVES INSTEAD OF GIVING POWER TO BOTH. THE. JUDICIAL SYSTEM THE JUDGE AND TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY IT VIOLATES THE SEPARATION SHIFTED TO THE PROSECUTOR TO DECIDE. IT ALSO REDUCES THE. THE INCENTIVE FOR. PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN CONVICTED. OF FELONY DE YOU WISE TO REHABILITATE THEMSELVES. BECAUSE EVEN IF THEY'RE AWARDED LATER FOR THEIR EFFORTS. AND IT'S REDUCED AFTER THAT CONVICTION. ALL IT WILL STILL REMAIN PRIOR BULL AND FOR TEN YEARS LATER. SO WE'RE ASKING FOR YOU TO VOTE NO THIS BILL DIED LAST YEAR. A SIMILAR BILL MORE ASKING YOU TO VOTE NO THIS YEAR THANK YOU THANK YOU. YES. KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. AB TWENTY EIGHT THIRTY FOUR WOULD MAKE AN UNPRECEDENTED EXCEPTION TO THE PROVISION OF PENAL CODE SECTION SEVENTEEN BE THAT PROVIDES THAT A REDUCTION TO A MISDEMEANOR UNDER THAT SECTION. MAKES THE CRIME A MISDEMEANOR FOR ALL PURPOSES. AND EVEN AS I UNDERSTAND THAT THE BILL IS TO BE AMENDED THAT THAT IS STILL AN UNPRECEDENTED EXCEPTION. ON I WOULD ALSO JUST TURN AROUND WHAT THE WITNESS I IN SUPPORT OF THE THE BILL SAID AND SAY. IN THE VERY RARE CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE SOMEONE WAS CHARGED AND SENTENCED TO A ON A FELONY DUI AND IT'S LATER ABLE THROUGH EVIDENCE OF THEIR REHABILITATION TO. GET THE JUDGE TO REDUCE IT TO A MISDEMEANOR WHICH IS HOW I UNDERSTAND IT WOULD APPLY NOW. THAT THAT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT PERSON THAT THAT THE JUDGE IS RECOGNIZING AND THAT SHOULD CARRY FORWARD EVEN IN THE SITUATION WHERE WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS. THEY ARE CHARGED WITH ANOTHER DUI OFFENSE WE WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE. QUESTION. ABOUT IT OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR DOING THE SPELL. I THINK YOU KNOW AND I AM AN ADVOCATE FOR. ALLOWING PEOPLE TO FIX THEIR MISTAKES. BUT DO YOU AYE IS COMPLETELY AVOIDABLE AND I THINK IN THOSE RARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE YOU DO HAVE A SITUATION. AND A FELONY DO YOU I AM PARTICULAR MEANS. YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD SOMEBODY. AND THOSE RARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE SOMEBODY MADE THAT MISTAKE THE FIRST TIME AND AND DID GET THAT REDUCED. THEY'RE ON NOTICE FOR THEMSELVES AND THERE'S A LOT YOU CAN DO TO AVOID. EVER AGAIN RISKING THE LIVES OF COUNTLESS INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE HAVING CARRIED YOU I LEGISLATION BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THE EFFECTS OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOMEBODY DRIVES DRUNK THE WRONG WAY OR SOMEBODY DRIVES DANCING KILLS. YOUNG LIVES THIS UNLIKE SO MANY CRIMES AND CRIMES OF OPPORTUNITY CRIMES OF NECESSITY CRIMES OF PASSION THIS ONE IS COMPLETELY COMPLETELY AVOIDABLE EVEN IF YOU SUFFER FROM ALCOHOLISM YOU CAN AVOID GETTING BEHIND A CAR AND DRIVING A CAR SO I THINK IF IT'S LEGISLATION I THINK AT SOME POINT. LEGISLATION I HOPE WE FIGURE OUT A WAY WE CAN BUT FOR. APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. MISTER LACKEY. YEAH ELLE. CLEARLY I ECHO THE SENTIMENTS JUST EXPRESSED A VERY VERY THANKFUL FOR THIS. COMMONSENSE LEGISLATION BECAUSE THINK ABOUT THIS. THERE'S A REASON WHY. FIRST TIME OFFENDERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR WHAT RECKLESS PLEA. AND HOW IN THAT INSTANCE. IF YOU DON'T RE OFFEND YOU DON'T EVER HAVE. HE HAD TO DO YOU AYE CONVICTION BUT IF YOU DO. DID A DOES COUNT AS A OF A PROBABLE OFFENSE IN THE SAME IS TRUE IN THIS INSTANCE. YOU GOTTA REMEMBER WH WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE WITH THIS PARTICULAR BILL. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY THAT HAS BEEN CAUGHT KAT NOT OFFENDED BUT CAUGHT. A FOURTH. THANKS. THAT ASSEMBLY THAT IS SUCH A HIGH RISK. TO OUR PUBLIC. THAT THE ONLY REASON. THEY GET HELP. BECAUSE OF THIS DRASTIC FELONY CIRCUMSTANCE. REBUILD TASTE IS ALWAYS OUR GOAL. BUT SO IS THE PROTECTION OF OUR PUBLIC AND SO. VERY THANKFUL FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK IT DOES BOTH AND I APPRECIATE YOU BRING FORWARD THANK YOU. OKAY AND YOU MAKE. CLOSE WAS TWICE WHEN I SAY THAT. WHO WERE ST THIS SUPPLY BILL WOULD APPLY ONLY AFTER THE PERSON IS CONVICTED AND WE HAVE CERTAINLY WE ARE HAPPY TO AMEND THE BILL TO REFLECT THAT BUT I JUST WONDER TO JUST CONCLUDE BY SAYING? WE'RE DEALING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SECOND FELONY DUI. CONVICTION AND A TF FELONY DUI IS ENOUGH THAT OF OFFENDER. IS HAS A FOURTH OR SUBSEQUENT DO YOU AYE OFFENSE IF ID Y. CAUSES SERIOUS INJURY THAT YOU AYE WAY PERSON IS KILLED WITH THE OFFENDER HAS PROVES HE COMMITTED A FELONY Y. AND SO. THIS BILL IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO SAVE LIVES AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIR AND THE STAFF TO TO REFLECT TO REFLECT ANY CHANGE IN THE BE MADE TO. MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL WAS FORD THANKS VERY MUCH. AND KNOWS TESTIMONY ONLY AND WHAT I WILL SUGGEST. TO THE OPPONENT TO LISTEN CAREFULLY TO WHAT MISTER. THE VICE CHAIR SAID AND. JEEZ ASSEMBLY WOMAN FROM SAN DIEGO SAID THAT. THEIR POSITION ON THIS THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THAT YOU WORK WITH FONG BECAUSE HE'S WILLING TO TAKE. A MEMBERS TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T. TAKE AWAY JUDGES' DISCRETION OVER WE LIMIT THEM SO. THIS GIVES YOU A WEEK. TO WORK IT OUT. AND DUBBED AS. AND THEN AS YOU CAN SEE NOW DID THERE'S A WILLINGNESS. BONTA COMMITTEES PART TWO OF. AND HIS WILLINGNESS FROM THE AUTHOR. TO WORK OUT SOME SOME RESOLUTION SO OF I I WOULD. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE OPPONENTS TO BILLS TO ACTIVELY WORKED WITH MR FONG WHO'S GRACIOUSLY NAM. THE CITY WANT TO WORK THROUGH THIS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OKAY. MISTER HOLDEN ESTIMATES VARY AND SAID. YOU'RE A LOT TALLER THAN HE IS HE LET YOU GO FIRST. I'M HOPEFUL. WE CAN BE VERY EFFICIENT IN PRESENTING THIS BILL AND I APPRECIATE. THE STUDENTS ARE IN AND WHOSE. GENEROSITY. I'M HERE TO PRESENT OUR GREAT AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY NINE. TO DO THE OFFICIAL. BUT YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'M HERE REPRESENT. AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY NINE A BILL THAT WILL INCREASE THE AMOUNT. OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE BY CLEARING. YOUR RECORD. LAST YEAR I JOINT AUTHORED A BILL WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. STOP EMPLOYERS FROM ASKING APPLICANTS ABOUT THEIR CRIMINAL HISTORY AND GIVE THEM A BETTER CHANCE AT EMPLOYMENT. I SUPPORTED THAT BILL BECAUSE A PERSON SHOULD BE ABLE TO RESTART THEIR LIFE AFTER THEY SERVE THEIR SENTENCE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO DO THAT IF PEOPLE IDENTIFY YOU ONLY BUY YOUR CRIMINAL HISTORY. WITH THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION FORTY SEVEN AND NEW LAWS CREATED BY THIS BODY. THERE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR A PERSON TO HAVE THEIR RECORD CLEARED. IF THEY ARE CONVICTED MORE PEOPLE THAN EVER HAD THE CHANCE TO SEEK EXPUNGEMENT. EXPUNGEMENT OF THEIR RECORDS. IF THEY ARE ARRESTED AND NOT CONVICTED MANY DO NOT KNOW THE IMPACT OF THAT THEIR ARREST THE REST ON THE RECORD OR THAT IT CAN BE SEALED. AND THERE'S A THAT DONE THIS BILL WILL INCREASE AWARENESS OF THE OPPORTUNITIES BY ADDING INFORMATIONAL SIGNAGE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND DURING PROBATION PROCESS. THERE WAS AN INCIDENT IN MY OWN DISTRICT WHEN YOUNG MAN WAS ARRESTED AND LATER. A LOT GO FOR A CRIME HE COULD PROVE HE DID NOT COMMIT. HOWEVER IT WAS NOT UNTIL LATER. HE REALIZE THAT THE ARRESTS WAS STILL ON AS BACKGROUND CHECKING AFFECTING HIS JOB PROSPECTS. THANKFULLY FOUND OUT IN TIME AND COMPLETED THE PROCESS THE DIFFICULT PROCESS. OF SEALING HIS RECORD. BUT NOT EVERYONE FINDS OUT THAT THEY CAN STILL THE RECORD OR THEY DON'T FIND OUT IN TIME. THIS BILL SIMPLY MAKE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE POINT OF ARREST AND TELLS THEM WHERE TO GO FOR NEXT STEPS. NO ONE SHOULD BE DEFINED SOLELY BY THEIR PAST BUT THEY SHOULD BE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO CREATE A FUTURE THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES COULD BE PROUD OF. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU OR ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AND. SECOND. MARGOT GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WHERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS DANIEL SANCHEZ ON BEHALF OF THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA. HERE IN OPPOSITION STAGE YOU WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS OFFICE FOR HAVING VERY PRODUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH US. OUR SPECIFIC CONCERN IS RELATIVE TO THE PROVISION IN THERE THAT TALKS ABOUT. PROBATION HAVING TO INCLUDE THIS IN A PRE SENTENCE REPORT. UNDER PENAL CODE TWELVE A THREE POINT FOUR OTHERS ARE THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE THAT SAYS THE DEFENDANT IS ALREADY REQUIRED TO RECEIVE INFORMATION ON THIS TYPE OF RELIEF. AYE SPECIFICALLY IT SAYS IN HIS ARE HORROR. PROBATION PAPERS AND SO THE. INFORMATION ON THIS TYPE OF RELIEF BEING SOUGHT IS ACTUALLY RD BEING PROVIDED OUGHT TO THE DEFENDANT. THAT I THINK THE CONCERN FOR US IS THAT THE PRE SENTENCE REPORT REALLY IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS. THAT'LL LET AND. CHIEF DAHLE IS SPEAK TO. SO WHERE WERE REQUESTING THAT DOT DOT SPECIFIC PROVISION BE STRICKEN ON BECAUSE IT'S. ESSENTIALLY RD BEING ACHIEVED UNDER EXISTING LAW I DO WANT TO INTRODUCE AYE CHIEF JIM SALLY POCKET ALSO THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICER OF SAN LUIS OBISPO. YES GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FEET TALL THREE POINT FOUR ALLOWS FOR AND IT REQUIRES THE ADVISEMENT IN THE PROBATION PAPERS WHICH IS A MUCH MORE GENERIC TERM THAN PROBATION REPORT. AS A MATTER OF PRACTICE PROBATION DEPARTMENTS PROVIDE THAT A AYE BITES ME IN THE PROBATION ORDERS THAT EVERY DEFENDANT IS GIVEN. THAT CLEARLY TAKES. CARE OF. HAVE BEEN THAT ADVISEMENT BEING DONE. YOU CAN CERTAINLY HAVE ABOUT HAVING IT ALSO INCLUDED IN THE PROBATION REPORT IS NOT EVERY. PROBATION CASE GETS A PROBATION REPORT IN FACT MANY COUNTIES THE COMMON PRACTICE IS TO WAIVE THE PROBATION REPORT  SIMPLY PROVIDE PROVIDE THE ORDERS OF PROBATION TO THE COURT FOR THE COURT TO SIGN. SO THE LAW CLEARLY AS AS AS IT STANDS NOW PROVIDES FOR THAT ADVISEMENT IN PROBATION ORDERS. THAT IS THE PRACTICE ACROSS THE STATE BY PROBATION DEPARTMENT SO THE DEFENSE ARE GETTING THAT ADVISEMENT NOW IN THE ORDERS THAT ARE GIVEN TO THEM. AS A TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THEIR PROBATION. THANK YOU. A. DO ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU KNOW I JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT. I THINK THAT. THE POSITION THAT OF THE THE CHIEF PROBATION OFFICERS HAVE TAKEN IS ONE THAT I FIND TO BE VERY IMPORTANT. OF SUCH AS IT IS THEIR DUTY TO TO CARRY OUT THIS PROVISION. AND I WOULD BE HOPE THAT YOU'D BE SENSITIVE TO OF WHAT THEY'VE JUST SAID. IT'S THE ORDERS LAW AS LONG AS THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED I THINK THAT SHOULD BE THE GOAL ANATA TO CREATE THIS CONFUSION. YES MISS GONZALEZ FLETCHER I'VE A QUESTION THAT I DON'T KNOW I DON'T IMAGINE THE AUTHOR COULD TELL ME BECAUSE THAT WOULD EXPECT YOU KNOW EVERYBODY ELSE'S BILL. BUT AND THIS. WE HAD A TEAM BILL THAT WENT MUCH FURTHER BUT THESE BILLS CAMP BOTH PASS AND BE SIGNED RIGHT THESE DON'T. GO TOGETHER. ON EXPUNGED AUTOMATIC IS FUN TO IS THAT RIGHT. I DON'T KNOW TIME TRYING TO GET MY FUTURE WORK RIGHT HERE IN COMMITTEE BUT DOES ANY AYE. THE PROBATION JOKES IT THIS IS STAFF KNOW. BUT THIS IS JUST NOTICE THIS IS JUST NOTICE BUT IF THERE'S AUTOMATIC EXPUNGEMENT YOU WOULDN'T NEED NOTICE. DID TO THE PROBATION FOLKS REMEMBER THAT BILL. YEAH FIGHT AGAINST IT CERTAINLY COULD THE CHAIR UP I CAN'T SPEAK. SPECIFICALLY AS TO WHETHER WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE TWO BUT I DO THINK AND AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK A CONCERN FOR US AS WELL AS A FOR HAVING THAT MORE GLOBAL DISCUSSION ON HOW BEST TO REMOVE BARRIERS BECAUSE. OPERATION IT'S A POX CERTAINLY SUPPORTS REMOVING BARRIERS AND AND WORKING WITH OUR FOLKS TO TO SEEK THE RELIEF THAT THERE UP ELIGIBLE FOR I DO THINK THERE COULD CERTAINLY BE CONFLICTS AND ARE ONE OF THESE NOT BEEN ABLE TO WORK IN LIGHT OF THE OTHER. DO YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE ARE THE TWO BILLS. I THINK I THINK THIS PARTICULAR BILL AND WE BELIEVE IT'S RD ACTUALLY BEING DONE UNDER CURRENT LAW. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S PROVISIONS ON WHAT THE COUNTY JAILS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO NOTICE UNDER THIS THAT SEPARATE FROM OUR P. SO. WE BELIEVE THAT EVEN IF THAT PROBATION REFERENCE IN THIS BILL STRICKEN DOT IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING AND THEREFORE THAT WOULD NOT CONFLICT WITH ANY OTHER MEASURES HAPPENING. IN LIKE A COMET THROUGH THE CHAIR I THINK THE DISTINCTION AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS THE OTHER. HAD TO DO WITH CONVICTIONS AS OPPOSED TO A REST I THINK THAT'S A VERY DISTINCT DIFFERENCE. IT IS ALSO A SURPLUS IS MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S POSTING SO THAT THE INDIVIDUAL KNOWS THEY CAN SEE AND READ AND BE CLEAR ASSIST MORE INFORMATION BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS. THAT THERE ARE STILL FOLKS OUT THERE THAT DON'T KNOW YOU SO IT MIGHT BE DONE IN MAY BE COVERED IN CURRENT LAW BUT THIS GOES THE EXTRA STEP TO SAY. WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN TAKE AN ADDITIONAL EFFORT TO POST THE INFORMATION. JUST LIKE YOU WOULD POST AND LET THEM KNOW THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A CALL. TO ALERT IF THEY WERE ARRESTED AND LET SOMEONE KNOW CAN PICK MY CHILD UP TODAY THAT YOU HAVE THAT RIGHT. OF THE SAME WOULD APPLY HERE THAT YOU HAVE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY. OF THAT. EXPUNGEMENT IS IT MAY NOT BE AUTOMATIC BUT THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY GO THROUGH A PROCESS AND A LOT OF TIMES. YOU FIND THAT. INDIVIDUALS ONCE THEY DO FIND OUT THEN THEY'LL GET A LAWYER. AND A LOT OF PAY FOR THE LAWYER AND STYLES OF DOLLARS TO GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS SO WE CAN CHECK THE BOX AND SAY. YEAH THEY THEY SHOULD KNOW. OR THERE IS A PROCESS BUT YOU GO THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND WHEN MADE IF THEY FIND OUT IN TIME. IT COULD COST THEM MORE MONEY IT COULD BE OP PUT THEM IN A. SITUATION WHERE ARE THEY JUST. DON'T GO FORWARD AND DO IT ALL AND SO WE'RE JUST TRYING TO. ARE CREATE. AN EXTRA STUFF. WILL BE AN EXTRA STEP. BUT WE THINK TO THE BENEFIT. OF THOSE WHO NOW. WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK OUT AND REHABILITATE THEIR LIFE AND THAT MEANS TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE FOR A JOB. OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO AFFECTED WE COMPETE. OFF FOR AND HAVE A FAIR LEVEL PLAYING CHANCE TO TO. OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO RENT A HOME. AND SO THESE ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS HAVE BECOME THE BUILDING BLOCKS FOR THEM TOO. OUGHT TO REALLY BE ABLE TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET AND BECOME PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS IN THE MORE WE CAN DO TO HELP EDUCATE I THINK IS A GOOD THING. I I LIKE THE BILL THAT WAS NOT MEANT TO. TO SAY ANYTHING EXCEPT LIKE THIS BILL AND I THINK THEY'RE BOTH GOING TO APPROPRIATIONS AND THIS SOUNDS LIKE A MUCH LESS EXPENSIVE BILL SO PERHAPS. YOU MISTER TEAM CAN TALK ABOUT HIGHER BILLS TALK TO EACH OTHER I LIKE TALKING TO MISTER TO I. THINK YOU THEN THAT NIGHT DENIED. WITHOUT THAT IS YOUR CLOTHES I WOULD THAT IS MY CLOTHES. AND AND I AGREE IT IF YOU IF YOU TALK. WITH TO CHOI PROBATION OFFICERS OH WITHOUT A JOB. I THINK YOUR POINT IS MAKING SURE. IT'S DONE. AS OPPOSED TO WE ALREADY DO IT AGAIN ANNALISA. SUBTLE DISTINCTION BUDDAH AS WE KNOW A GOVERNMENT. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO DO SOMETHING IS TO ENSURE THAT IT GETS OUT. BUT WE HAVE NOTICES ALL OVER THIS CAPITAL MOUNT SEXUAL HARASSMENT BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. PEOPLE KNOW. BEAR RIGHTS AND AND AND. AND WHAT OUR OBLIGATIONS ARE A AND IT'S POSTED. EVERYWHERE NOW SO. THAT'S TO MAKE SURE THAT IT GETS DONE I THINK THAT'S WHERE MR HOLDEN. AND AND THE SPONSOR THIS BILL ARE ARE WORKING TOWARDS LIKE TO KEEP TO BECOME TOGETHER AND WORKED OUT SUCH AS RECOMMENDED AYE VOTE. FOR SIX. THE EMOTION DEPRESSED BUT PROBABLY. AB TWENTY FIVE NINETY NINE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE JOXER AYE LACKEY. GOD LEO. GONZALEZ FLETCHER GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE KILEY. QUIRK. QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO AYE. THE MEASURE PASSES. AND MR QUIRK LOST HIS VOICE. AND YOU NEVER SUPPORT. THANK YOU. AND THE GENTLEMAN. WHO ALLOWED MR HOLDEN TO GO FIRST? WITH IN HIS AREA. I HAVE. AB TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY THREE AND A. B. THIRTY FORTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COLLEAGUES. A TRAMP PRESENTING A FIRST THE AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE. THIS BILL ENSURES THAT HUMAN TRAFFICKER AND RAPISTS SERVE THEIR FULL SENTENCES BY ADDING HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND RATE TO THE LIST OF VIOLENT CRIMES. HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS A FORM OF MODERN SLAVERY AND SUBJECTS INCREASING NUMBERS OF VICTIMS. THE SEXUAL EXPLOITATION IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. IN CALIFORNIA ALONE STARTING NUMBER STARTLING NUMBERS OF CHILDREN ARE FORCED INTO LABOR AND SEX TRAFFICKING EACH YEAR. MAKING. THEM SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST EXPLOITED AND VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS. VICTIMS ARE OFTEN SUBJECTED TO RAPE ABUSE ISOLATION CONFINEMENT AN EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL TRAUMA. THE SERIOUSNESS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND RAPE. SHOULD REQUIRE THAT THE PUNISHMENT FIT THE CRIME. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF SINCE THE PASSING OF PROP FIFTY SEVEN THE PERPETRATORS OF THESE CRIMES WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY PAROLE. FOR INSTANCE BROCK TURNER. A FORMER COLLEGE ATHLETE CONVICTED ON THREE COUNTS. OF FELONY ASSAULT AND SEXUAL ASSAULT WOULD HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE FOR EARLY RELEASE. HAD HE BEEN SENT TO STATE PRISON. AB TWENTY TWENTY THREE STRENGTHENS THE PURPOSE OF PROP FIFTY SEVEN WHICH WAS INTENDED TO ALLOW. NON VIOLENT REHABILITATED OFFENDERS ELIGIBILITY FOR EARLY RELEASE AND NOT PERPETRATORS OF VIOLENT CRIMES. A WITH ME I HAVE DAN FELIZ OTTO WITH THE LA DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. GOOD MORNING. MORNING SICKNESS RETIREMENT. DAN FELIZ AUTO ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION THIS MORNING. OF AS THE MRS AREA AND. POINTED OUT. THIS BILL IS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE UNINTENDED. CONSEQUENCES PROP FIFTY SEVEN. WHEN THE GOVERNOR INITIALLY DID HIS REGULATIONS FOR PROFITING SEVEN. THESE INDIVIDUALS WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE OPPORTUNITY FOR. EARLY PAROLE IN A PROFIT TO SEVEN. RECENTLY THE. SACRAMENTO SUPERIOR COURT. RULED THAT. ONLY OFFENSES ARE ACTUALLY LISTED AND. ARE VIOLENT FELONY SECTION OR COVERED BY. PROP FIFTY SEVEN. THEREFORE. IN ORDER TO EFFECTUATE WHAT. YOU KNOW WAS. THE UNDERSTANDING OF. THE PROPONENTS WHEN THE CAMPAIGN FOR PROP FIFTY SEVEN THEY SAID THAT THESE RAPISTS SEX OFFENDERS HUMAN TRAFFICKING. OFFENDERS WOULD NOT BE RELEASED EARLY UNDER PROFITABLE. THERE WAS SOME DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS TRUE. BUT THAT WAS WHAT THE PROPONENTS. CAMPAIGNED ON. LIKE SAID THE SUCCUBUS SUPERIOR COURT RECENTLY. RULED THAT THAT WAS AND IN FACT THE CASE. THIS BILL WILL FIX THAT. PROBLEM THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS BILL. OF LAST YEAR WHEN OUR OFFICE SPONSORED. OF THE TEARS SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE ALL MOVED INTO THE LIFETIME. REGISTRATION SECTION BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE OFFENSE THE DANGER CSUS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS HUMAN TRAFFICKING. YEAH. IS BAD IN OF ITSELF BUT THERE'S ALL THE ASSOCIATED CRIMES THAT GO ALONG WITH IT YOU KNOW. ALMOST ALWAYS YOU HAVE. INDIVIDUALS BEING PROVIDED WITH SOME TYPE OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE. INDIVIDUALS ARE BEATEN RAPED ROBBED. THAT IS A REGULAR OCCURRENCE. THE IDEA OF A YOU KNOW RAPING AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON OR SOMEBODY WHO SO INTOXICATED THAT THEY CANNOT. I EITHER CONSENT OR DEFEND THEMSELVES. TO ME THAT IS A VIOLENT RAPE. AND I THINK THAT THE PUBLIC WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT AS A FORM OF VIOLENT CRIME. THIS BILL SIMPLY CODIFIES WHAT. IS THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROPONENTS OF PROP FIFTY SEVEN WHAT I THINK THE GENERAL PUBLIC WOULD VIEW AS VIOLENT CRIMES. AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW FOR THE. PILL CHO TO ADDRESS THAT. SO WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF AN IMAC IS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES OF SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING. FISHER FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. BY ADDING CRIMES TO THE LIST OF VIOLENT FELONIES AB TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY THREE WOULD PERPETUATE CALIFORNIA'S EXPENSIVE AND INEFFECTIVE OVER RELIANCE ON INCARCERATION. INTERJECT DIRECT CONTRADICTION TO WHAT THE VOTERS INTENDED WHEN THEY ENACTED PROP FIFTY SEVEN. AB TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY THREE ALSO SINGLES OUT HUMAN TRAFFICKING FOR TREATING UP FOR TREATMENT AS A VIOLENT FELONY A CRIME FOR WHICH INCREASED PENALTIES HAVE JUST RECENTLY GONE INTO EFFECT. THIS IS NOT A BILL THAT PICKED FIXES A MISTAKE OR PUT TEND TO AFFECT THE TRUE INTENT OF THE VOTERS. IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS DISCUSSED IN IN THE ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST PROP FIFTY SEVEN THE VOTERS KNEW WHAT THEY WERE VOTING FOR. THE VOTERS UNDERSTOOD THAT LAYS LENGTHY PRISON SENTENCES DO LITTLE TO PREVENT THE TYPES OF CRIME FOR WHICH THEY ARE IMPOSED. THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT THE CHOICE THAT THEY WERE MAKING WAS WHAT WAS NEEDED TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON PRISON COSTS. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD NOT SECOND GUESS THAT CHOICE. SERIOUS PENALTIES ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE FOR ALL OF THE CRIMES ADDRESSED IN AB TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY THREE WE URGE YOUR NOVEL. YES ANY OTHER WITNESS YES. MARCO GEORGE FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU. ARM. I'M I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT UMAN TRAFFICKING WHICH IS A MODERN DAY FORM OF SLAVERY AND THAT'S WRONG. BUT THIS BILL IS UNNECESSARY. THE UNDERLYING CRIMES FOR THE MOST PART ARE READY ARE FELONIES. OF THE SENTENCING RANGE INCLUDES LIFE IN PRISON FOR SOME OF THE OFFENSES. OUR LENGTHENING PRISON SENTENCES DOES NOT MAKE THE PUBLIC SAFER. IT RESULTS AS WE'VE SEEN AND MASS INCARCERATION. ARE ARE COMMUNITIES BECOME DEVASTATED. BECAUSE SCARCE PUBLIC RESOURCES AND UP BEING DEVOTED TO BUILDING MORE PRISONS. AND INCARCERATING MORE PEOPLE. INSTEAD OF SCHOOLS HOUSING AND HEALTHCARE. AND YOU KNOW AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER I HAVE REPRESENTED ON OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN CHARGED. WITH. THESE OFFENSES I'VE ALSO REPRESENTED. VALLEY MEN AND WOMEN WHO WERE THE VICTIMS. AND VAGUE BUT DON'T NEED A FALSE PROMISE OF LOCKING UP THE THE PERPETRATORS FOR LONGER AND LONGER PERIODS OF TIME. INSTEAD THEY NEED HOUSING EDUCATION COUNSELING. AND A WAY TO GO HOME AGAIN. AND THIS BILL DOESN'T OFFER THAT. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU KNOW FOR. GOOD MORNING GOING BACK IS FOR ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE INCREASE SPENDING ON MENTAL HEALTH AND TRAUMA CARE AND WE OPPOSE INCREASE SPENDING ON MASS INCARCERATION. AND WE STRONGLY OPPOSE ANY EXPANSION OF THREE STRIKES AS A REMEDY FOR THE STATE'S PROBLEMS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE MISSIONS AREA. THANK YOU I AM. I I WOULDN'T AT AT AT TIME WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO DECREASE. THE OVER POPULATION OF PRISONS AND TRY TO REHABILITATE AND PUT PEOPLE BACK INTO NORMAL SETTINGS IN SOCIETY. A AND I'VE BEEN A. VOCAL IS WELL AS VOTING ADVOCATE OF THESE MEASURES. I WOULDN'T BRING SOMETHING LIKE THIS FORWARD IF I DIDN'T SEE THAT THERE WAS A NEED TO ADDRESS SOMETHING. THAT THEY MAY HAVE BEEN SOME OVERSIGHT ON AT THE END OF THE DAY. IT'S HUMAN BEINGS THAT RIGHT THESE LAWS. AND SOMETIMES THEY NEED TO BE TWEAKED OR CHANGED. A EVEN IF IT'S AS SHORT AS WITHIN THE TWO YEAR PERIOD BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE BEEN SOME THINGS THAT WERE OVERLOOKED OR. IN AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS IT IN A COURT IT WENT THE OTHER WAY. WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT. WAS UNEXPECTED EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT HAPPENED. SO. THIS IS A VERY SMALL STEP IN TRYING TO CAPTURE A VERY SPECIFIC AREA. A THAT THE. WAS MEET ME OF SHOULD HAVE SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN TAKEN OUT. AND THAT JUST TO CORRECT SOME OF THE PREVIOUS STATEMENTS. THIS WAS THIS DOES NOT LINK. ANYONE'S PRISON. TERM VISSER SIMPLY PLACES BACK A SEVERAL DIFFERENT AREAS OF VIOLENT SEXUAL CRIMES THAT WERE TAKEN OUT BY PROP FIFTY SEVEN. SO WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THEM CHAIR CALLED ROLE. VICTOR. OKAY.

IN ADDITION THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE COURT TO ORDER THAT CONVENE A CONVICTED PERSON TO REFRAIN FROM. FROM CONTACT WITH ANIMALS AND WOULD REQUIRE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT TO BE ISSUED.

WHAT WILL MISTER BONTA YOU READY TO PRESENT AND SHARE CARILLO? IF YOU HAVE TO BUILD UP. WOULD YOU AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE YOU MADAM CHAIR CAN I START WITH AB SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE THE CANNABIS EXPUNGEMENT BILL. BOTH. THE BALLOT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR COLLEAGUES AND STAFF AB SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE CREATES A SIMPLER AN EXPEDITED PATHWAY FOR CALIFORNIANS. TO TURN THE PAGE BY HAVING CERTAIN CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS FOR CANNABIS RELATED OFFENSES AUTOMATICALLY REMOVED FROM OR REDUCED. ON THEIR RECORDS PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR WHICH VOTERS PASSED WITH FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT APPROVAL IN IN NOVEMBER TWENTY SIXTEEN CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT. NOT ONLY PROSPECTIVELY REDUCED OR ELIMINATED MANY CANNABIS LAW VIOLATIONS BUT MADE THOSE CHANGES RETROACTIVE THIS MEANS PEOPLE WITH FELONIES MISDEMEANORS FOR CANNABIS RELATED OFFENSES THAT WERE CHANGED BY PROP SIXTY FOUR ARE NOW. LEGALLY ENTITLED TO PETITION THE COURTS TO EXPUNGE REDUCE THOSE CONVICTIONS THAT IS THEIR RIGHT TO SUBSTANTIVE RIGHT THAT WAS GIVEN BY PROP SIXTY FOUR. MY BILL DOES NOT CREATE ANY NEW SUBSTANTIVE RIGHT AT ME AND REALLY CHANGES THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW THE PROCESS REQUIRES. INDIVIDUALS WANT TO KNOW THAT THEIR ELIGIBLE TO TO. PETITION AND PAY A FEE FOR FINGERPRINTS AND. FOR FILING IN THE TAKE TIME OUT OF THE DAY POTENTIALLY TO TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE HEARINGS. ALL OF WHICH MAKES THE SUBSTANTIVE RIGHT THAT'S BEEN GRANTED. FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY FROM INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE ENTITLED TO ITSELF MY BILL PROPOSES? AND. AT MORE EFFICIENTPROCESS I THINK IT'S A GOOD GOVERNMENT APPROACH WHEREBY. THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL SEARCH THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD DATABASE TO IDENTIFY ALL. ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS AND THEN PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO THE COURTS. THE COURTS WILL THEN BE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY THAT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES THE PROSECUTORS. TO ALLOW THEM TIME TO REVIEW EACH OF THE CASES AND AS IS THEIR RIGHT UNDER PROP SIXTY FOUR AND IS NOT CHANGING WITH THIS BILL I CHALLENGE ANYONE OF THE CASES THAT THEY WISH. IF IN THEIR VIEW THAT INDIVIDUAL PRESENTS UNREASONABLE RISK OF DANGER TO PUBLIC SAFETY. AND THEN AFTER THE REVIEW PROCESS THE COURT AND THEN MODIFY THE RECORD IF THERE'S NO CHALLENGE BY THE PROSECUTION SO WE WE THINK THIS IS. A BETTER WAY TO YOU KNOW WE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE ONLY. A FEW THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WHO'VE APPLIED SO FAR UNDER THE EXISTING SYSTEM THAT LEAVES HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS. WHO CAN HAVE THEIR RECORDS EXPUNGED? OR REDUCED WHO ARE NOT GETTING ACCESS TO THIS RIGHT AND WE BELIEVE THEY SHOULD. AGAIN IT DOES NOT CREATE A AND A NEW SUBSTANCE A RIGHT IT JUST BRINGS THAT RIGHT CLOSER TO INDIVIDUALS AND IS THAT. EXAMPLE OF OF GOVERNMENT DO WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE PROVIDING THE RIGHTS THAT. CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY ENTITLED TO TO THIS CALIFORNIANS. WITH ME HERE IS. YOU AND ME SEIZE HERNANDEZ OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY COORDINATOR WITH DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE. GREAT THANK YOU GOOD MORNING. HONORABLE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS OWN USES ARE NOT THIS. CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY COORDINATOR WITH THE DRUG POLICY ALLIANCE A LOCAL NATIONAL NONPROFIT WORKING ON A POLICIES AROUND HARM REDUCTION CRIMINAL JUST REFORM AND CANNABIS REGULATION. I'M HERE TODAY TO URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON AB SEVENTY. SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE A BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE AUTOMATIC A PROP SIXTY FOUR RELIEF FOR PEOPLE QUALIFY. WHICH IS HUNDRED OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF PROP SIXTY FOUR. I'VE ORGANIZED SEVERAL DOZEN EXPUNGEMENT FAIRS MANY. IN YOUR DISTRICTS. AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF PEOPLE HAVE COME IN FOR PROP SIXTY FOR RELIEF DUE TO A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF THESE PROVISIONS. OF AVAILABLE LEGAL SERVICES IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC BARRIERS. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME CONTEXT AROUND MARIJUANA PROHIBITION CALIFORNIA IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THERE HAVE BEEN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND MARIJUANA ARRESTS ARE MOST OF THESE WERE BLACK AND BROWN. YOUNG PEOPLE. WE SEE THAT BLACK LATINO Y. PEOPLE SELLING USE CANNABIS AT SIMILAR RATES BUT BLACK AND LATINOS A BLACK PEOPLE MIGHT BE KNOWS. ARE TWO TOP TWO TO FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED FOR CANNABIS OFFENSE I THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE A NOT ONLY FOR ADULTS GUY THIS IMPACTS YOUTH A LOT. IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WE'VE SEEN THAT. YOUTH UNDER EIGHTEEN HAVE COMPROMISED HAVE COMPRISE TWO THIRDS OF ALL CANNABIS ARE ARRESTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO THIS IS NOT ONLY AN ADULT ISSUE IT IMPACTS YOU THEN A LOTTA YOU'D HAVE A KIND OF HIS CONVICTIONS I NEED A DRESS THAT I NEED TO GET ADDRESSED. I'M I'M SURE THAT YOU ALL THE WHERE I AM PREACHING TO THE CHOIR BUT HAVING A CRIMINAL CONVICTION BECAUSE A LOT OF BARRIERS FOR PEOPLE. OF CLOSING THE DOOR TAKEN. EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES HOUSING AND OTHER SUPPORTIVE SERVICES ARE THE RECORD CHANGE PROVISIONS OF THE PROP SIXTY FOUR HELP RE OPEN THE DOORS TO SOME OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. OTHER RECORD CHANGE PROCESS IS NOT EASY AYE AND IT AND IT'S PRETTY EXPENSIVE IF YOU HAVE AN ATTORNEY WELL FIRST OFF YOU NEED AN ATTORNEY TO TELL YOU IF YOU'RE ELIGIBLE AND I YOU CAN DECIDE WHETHER YOU ARE THAT'S A LEGAL PRACTICE. ARE YOU NEED TO GET A COPY OF ALL YOUR RECORDS YOU NEED TO SUBMIT ALL THESE DOCUMENTS THIS IS JUST SACRAMENTO PACKET. THIS IS THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL PACKET THESE ARE ALL CRIMINAL FORMS OF PEOPLE NEED TO FILL OUT THAT REGULAR FOLKS DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO. AND SO THESE ARE SOME OTHER BARRIERS. YOU NEED A VOTING EACH COURTHOUSE WERE YOU CONVICTED. TO SUBMIT THESE DOCUMENTS YOU NEED TO HAVE A THIRD PARTY SUBMIT THE PROOF OF SERVICE SO THAT'S ALSO DIFFICULT TO HAVE SOMEONE ELSE YOU KNOW GET OUT OF THE JOBURG SCHOOL TO GOING TO SUBMIT THESE DOCUMENTS. YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT COURTHOUSE WHO WERE CONVICTED YOU NEED TO KNOW HOW MUCH CANNABIS WAS INVOLVED IN THE OFFENSE NORMAL FOLKS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT AREAS YOU NEED TO GO TO. SO DOES LAW ENFORCEMENT OPERATION OTHERS TO GET THAT INFORMATION I'LL BE OF THEM ALL BE FAST. SO THIS DIFFICULT PROCESS IS KEPT THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS FROM OBTAINING PROP SIXTY FOUR RELIEF AS OF LAST YEAR'S SEPTEMBER ONLY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE YOUTH CASES HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED FOR PROP SIXTY FOUR REALLY ONLY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE. AND FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FOUR ADULTS WE KNOW THAT THERE'S ABOUT A MILLION CASES IN CALIFORNIA COULD POTENTIALLY QUALIFY FOR PROP SIXTY FOR RELIEF. US EMBASSIES AND SO THIS IS NOT NEW DOING AUTOMATIC PROP SIXTY FOUR RECORD CHANGE SOME FRANCISCO IS DOING IT THE DA'S PUSHING FOR ACTS OF THE EAGLE OTHER DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ALSO MOVING FORWARD. THAT'S GONNA HELP ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS A VERY. VERY SMALL DROP IN THE BUCKET COMPARED TO THE MILLION THAT QUALIFY. NOW THE CALIFORNIA. AND ITS LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARE PROFITING AND ITS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE PROFITING OFF THE SALES OF RECREATIONAL CANNABIS A WE MUST INVEST IN HELPING THOSE IMPACTED BY MARIJUANA PROHIBITION. THIS IS RACIAL JUSTICE AND I URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON SEVENTEEN NINETY THREE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BONTA. THANK YOU. YOUR THING BY RUN FOR OFFICE. YEAH YEAH EVERY COUPLE YEARS. WHERE THEY WERE BEFORE I START IT WOULD DISTRIBUTE LIVE? YEAH Y. YOU OUT THERE THAT. YEAH YOU GOT A LONG WAY TO GO. PEOPLE. JUST LOOK AT THAT. BUT BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE PRETTY CHEAP PROVISIONS. MICHAEL CALIFORNIANS ARE NOT ONLY THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD LEGAL SERVICES CURRENTLY THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS IN RURAL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA WHERE THERE ARE NO PUBLIC DEFENDER OFFICES WHERE THEY CAN'T JUST GOING GET SERVICES. AND A LOT OF LOW INCOME PEOPLE THAT WILL NEVER GET ACCESS TO HAVING AN ATTORNEY PRIVATE ATTORNEYS TRIED TO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO DO THIS AND THEY'RE ONLY IN IT TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK WEAVER FROM PUBLIC DEFENDERS ACROSS THE STATE. THAT THERE'S BEEN MANY FILINGS WITH ERRORS SUBMITTED BY PRIVATE ATTORNEYS INSTEAD OF GETTING A FULL JUST MITCHELL FOR PROPHECY PORKY'S WHICH ENTITLED TO THE. ENTITLED TO UNDER THE LAW THERE'LL BE SUBMITTING FOR LIKE REDUCTIONS YEAH THAT'S THAT'S A ONE ADVOCATE THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALERT ANY OTHER WITNESSES THE SUPPORT. HI ELLEN COME WITH CALIFORNIA NORMAL WHERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL A BIG REASON PEOPLE VOTED IN FAVOR OF PROP SIXTY FOUR WAS THAT IT WAS GOING TO BRING JUSTICE TO ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN CONVICTED.

EXPENDS THESE RECORDS. HOWEVER WE'VE HAD AN ON GOING DOLLAR DIALOGUE WITH THE MEMBERS OFFICE WE LOOK CAN LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO. LOOK FOR WAYS TO MAKE THE BILL MORE EFFICIENT AND. NOT BE SO BURDENSOME ON THE COURTS THANK YOU THANK YOU. BUT. OUR NIC. QUESTIONS FROM. COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE MOST BONTA. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND IN COLLEGE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS BILL WILL FOR THE CREATE REAL DIFFERENCES IN PEOPLE'S LIVES BRING THEM CLOSER TO JOBS CLOSER TO HOUSING AND OTHER SERVICES AND. WE ALL KNOW THAT. THAT VULNERABLE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE WAR ON DRUGS THIS WILL PROVIDE SOME SEMBLANCE OF JUSTICE. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. DEAR MOTION. MISTER QUIRK MOVEMENTS CARILLO SECOND. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY THREE THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE AYE DANCER AYE LACKEY. CARILLO. CAVIAR AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. KILEY QUIRK HI QUIRK I SANTIAGO SANTIAGO AYE. THAT MEASURE PASSES THANK YOU. AND NOW WE HAVE MR ALLEN OLD MISS ABOUT YOU HAVE. I THINK A BILL I'M SORRY UP IN A HURRY I SAW. WE HAD OUR SECOND TO BEGIN MAYBE RATE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS IS AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY FIVE. WHICH. WOULD DEPOLITICIZE INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY IN THE PARDON AND COMMUTATION PROCESS IN CALIFORNIA INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CONVICTED OF A CRIME MAY APPLY FOR UP A GUBERNATORIAL PART IN OR COMMUTATION. IF THEY HAVE DEMONSTRATED EXEMPLARY BEHAVIOR THE PARDON RESOURCES SPECIFIED RIGHTS THAT PEOPLE LOSE BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY SUCH AS THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN A PROFESSIONAL LICENSE. A PARDON ALSO ALLOWS FOR IMMIGRANTS THREE OPENED THEIR DEPORTATION CASES. ALTHOUGH THOSE CONVICTED OF CRIMES MAY SPEND YEARS REHABILITATING THEMSELVES INTO PRODUCTIVE AND LAW ABIDING RESIDENTS IMMIGRANTS ARE FACED WITH THE RISK OF BEING. SENT TO COUNTRIES WHERE THEY HAVE LITTLE OR NO TIES TO THE SHARP INCREASE IN IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT ARRESTS ONE OF THE PRIMARY REASONS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SEEKING PART IN THIS. IS TO OBTAIN POTENTIAL RELIEF FROM DEPORTATION PARDONS ARE ONE OF THE ONLY AVAILABLE AVENUES OF RELIEF FOR IMMIGRANTS FACING DEPORTATION. SINCE THE SO CALLED TOUGH ON CRIME POLICIES WERE ENACTED IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES CALIFORNIA GOVERNORS HAVE GRANTED VERY FEW PARDONS FROM NINETEEN NINETY ONE TO TWENTY TEN THREE CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR'S GRANTED A TOTAL OF JUST TWENTY EIGHT. PARDONS BY CONTRAST GOVERNOR BROWN HAS GRANTED ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN PARDONS THUS FAR IN HIS THIRD AND FOURTH TERMS. GOVERNOR BROWN RECENTLY ISSUED SEVERAL PARDONS TO IMMIGRANTS FACING IMMINENT DEPORTATION WE APPLAUD. THESE ACTIONS OF THAT GOVERNOR BROWN FOR THIS FUTURE GOVERNORS MAY NOT BE WILLING TO GRANT PARDONS ESPECIALLY IN THEIR FIRST TERM THERE'S ALSO LITTLE TRANSPARENCY. AROUND THE PART IN PROCESS INDIVIDUALS WHO APPLY FOR PARDONS DO NOT KNOW IF THE REQUEST IS RECEIVED THEY DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BEEN REVIEWED OR IF OR WHEN A DECISION WILL BE MADE. TWENTY EIGHT FORTY FIVE WOULD CREATE A PART IN AND COMMUTATION PANEL. TO PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE GOVERNOR ON PARDONING COMMUTATION REQUESTS. AB TWENTY FORTY FIVE WOULD ESTABLISH A TIMELINE FOR RECOMMENDATIONS ON PARDON REQUEST INCLUDING AN EXPEDITED PROCESS FOR URGENT PARTING REQUEST SUCH AS THOSE OF THE PENDING DEPORTATION ORDER. THE PANEL WOULD ALSO PROVIDE NOTIFICATIONS TO APPLICANTS WHEN THEY RECEIVE APPLICATION BEGIN THE INVESTIGATION. AND ISSUE A RECOMMENDATION. SO WE THINK WE THINK THAT. THIS NEW PROCESS THAT'S BEEN PROPOSED PRICE MORE TRANSPARENCY MORE EXPERTISE MORE TIMELINESS MORE RESPONSIVENESS TO PARDON REQUESTS. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A AYE VOTE AT THIS. TIME WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY OPPOSITION. BOB WITH ME HERE TODAY IS HAFSA ALAMEDA COORDINATOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COALITION OF WOMEN PRISONERS A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. AND ALSO SUPPORT IS DANIEL MAY HER WHO WAS RECENTLY PARDONED BY GOVERNOR BROWN AND WAS REPRESENTED BY ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE ANOTHER CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU. QUIRK SECOND. MR SATO MOVED. YES WITNESSES YOU HAVE. FOUR MINUTES BUT WHERE WERE YOU IN A. BREAK IT UP. I THINK MISTER CHAIRMAN KENNEDY MY NAME IS DANIEL MEYER I'M HERE BEFORE YOU TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FORTY FIVE. OF THE BILL IS NEEDED TO MAKE THE PARDON PROCESS MORE ACCESSIBLE AND TRANSPARENT SO THAT MORE PEOPLE CAN BENEFIT FROM THIS IMPORTANT AVENUE FOR IMMIGRATION RELIEF. MY STORY I WAS THREE YEARS OLD WHEN MY FAMILY LEGALLY IMMIGRATED FROM ACCOUNT TO THE UNITED STATES. AS I GOT OLDER I FELL IN WITH THE WRONG CROWD A DECISION TO CHANGE MY LIFE. AT THE AGE OF TWENTY I PARTICIPATED IN ARMED ROBBERY I WAS ARRESTED CONVICTED AND SERVED MY SENSE IN THE STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. UPON COMPLETION OF MY SENTENCE I WAS TRANSFERRED TO AN ICE DETENTION FACILITY IN EL CENTRO CALIFORNIA WORLDS PLACED ON TRIAL AGAIN. THIS TIME IN IMMIGRATION COURT AND ORDERED REMOVED FROM THE UNITED STATES ESSENTIALLY IMMIGRANTS HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UNITED STATES IS YOUNG CHILDREN. ARE FACED WITH A RISK OF BEING DEPORTED TO COUNTRIES WHERE THEY HAVE LITTLE OR NO TIES OF THIS IS IT SENATE SINCERELY MIKE MY SITUATION WHERE. I LOOKED AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE I BASICALLY HAVE NO INFORMATION NO WAY OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT WOULD LIFE BE OVER THERE. OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT REFUSED TO RECOGNIZE ME THE CITIZEN TO DO THE HAND OVER NINETEEN NINETY NINE. AND REFUSE TO ISSUE TRAVEL DOCUMENTS SO I'M BASICALLY HERE WITHOUT A COUNTRY. I WAS PLACED ON SOMETHING CALLED INDEFINITE DETENTION. AND FOR THE NEXT ONE HALF YEARS I WAS EVENTUALLY RELEASED ON AN ORDER OF SUPERVISION PENDING REMOVAL. THAT REMOVAL ORDER HAS BEEN STANDING FOR SIXTEEN YEARS WITHOUT RELIEF. AND DURING THAT TIME KNOWING THAT THE DEPORTATION ORDER CAN BE ACTIVATED ANYTIME PROVIDED THE COUNTRY WAS. WILLING TO ACCEPT ME. IT STILL DIDN'T MATTER I'D ALREADY TURNED MY LIFE AROUND WHILE I WAS ALREADY IN PRISON. GOT A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AND CONTINUE TO WORK ON SELF HELP PROGRAMS AND AS I WAS RELEASED I CONTINUE TO GIVE BACK TO COMMUNITY AND PROVIDE ANY KIND OF SUPPORT THAT I COULD TO. ENCOURAGE GROWTH IN MY OWN LIFE AND OTHERS. TWO WEEKS AGO AS YOU HEARD EARLIER WAS FORCED TO BE GRANTED A FULL PARDON BY OUR GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN. I CANNOT THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR THIS. THIS IS ACTUALLY GOOD SECOND CHANCE IN LIFE FOR ME BECAUSE NOW THIS GIVES ME THE OPPORTUNITY CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING SO FOR. THE PART ALSO JEWEL LOT OF CRITICISM. BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND HIS SUPPORTERS. OUT MULTI RECOGNIZE THE IMMIGRANTS ARE THE BACKBONE OF MANY HARD WORKING COMMUNITIES. WE ARE SUBJECTED TO HARSH CHARACTER ATTACKS SIMPLY FOR SEEKING A BETTER LIFE FOR OUR FAMILIES. SOME SUCH AS MYSELF HAVE MADE MISTAKES BUT I FOUND NEW PURPOSE IN THE SERVICE OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. AB TWENTY FORTY FIVE WOULD ALLOW OTHERS SUCH AS MYSELF WHO HAVE DEMONSTRATED COMMITMENT TO POSITIVE CHANGE AND SERVICE TO THEIR COMMUNITY FIND A PATHWAY TO A NORMAL LIFE THROUGH A GUBERNATORIAL PARDON. SPECIFICALLY IT WOULD INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY AND TRANSPARENCY IN THE PARDON PROCESS WHICH CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE. WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO OR CANNOT AFFORD COUNSEL? AND IT WILL BUILD ON GOVERNOR BROWN'S LEGACY OF ISSUING A RECORD NUMBER OF PARDONS BY ESTABLISHING A PANEL. DEDICATED TO REVIEWING IN MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS ON PARDON AND COMMUTATION APPLICATION. SO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE MY STORY PLEASE VOTE YES ON AB TWENTY FORTY FIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THERE. OF MY NAME IS HASA ALUMINIUM.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE CHAIR MEMBERS THIS IS ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE ZERO FOUR WHICH REQUIRES LGBT. SPECIFIC TRAINING FOR PEACE OFFICERS AND DISPATCHERS. WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE. OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ON THE IMPORTANCE OF RESPECTING DIVERSITY AMONGST COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS. WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT AIR IS GREGORY REALITY PROFESSOR OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN LGBT STUDIES IN A RETIRED POLICE OFFICER AND DAMIEN SAN VAULT ERECTOR. OF POLICE ACADEMY IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE TRAINS INNER AT NAPA VALLEY COLLEGE. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. THE MORNING EVERYONE AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING US MY NAME IS GREAT MORALE YEAH I'M A PROFESSOR OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AND LGBT STUDIES A NAPA VALLEY COLLEGE. AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE OH FOR. I BEGAN MY LAW ENFORCEMENT CAREER AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. AND I KNEW FROM THE MOMENT I WALKED INTO THE DOOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT I WAS GAY BUT I DID NOT HAVE ANY IDEA ABOUT WHAT I WOULD FACE. INSIDE THOSE DOORS BUT I LEARNED QUICKLY THAT I COULD NEVER COME OUT. AFTER COMING OUT IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR I'VE WRITTEN THREE BOOKS ABOUT SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY MINORITIES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND OVER THE LAST DECADE I HAVE TALKED WITH NUMEROUS GAY LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS ABOUT THE HARASSMENT AND DISCRIMINATION. THEY'VE SUFFERED WHILE WORKING AT CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. HAVE ALSO SERVED AS AN EXPERT WITNESS IN SEVERAL UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION CASES INVOLVING LAW ENFORCEMENT. OFFICERS WHO ARE GAY. WELL YOU WOULD THINK THAT WHAT I EXPERIENCE BACK IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WOULD NOT BE THE CASE TODAY. SADLY IT IS. TODAY WITH US IN THE AUDIENCE AS A DEPUTY SHERIFF FROM THE EAST BAY. WHO RIGHT NOW IS SUFFERING FROM THE KIND OF HARASSMENT DISCRIMINATION THIS BILL WILL ADDRESS? HE IS A DECORATED COMBAT VETERAN AND A CAPTAIN IN THE U. S. MARINE CORPS. HE WAS A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH FORSMAN OFFICER UNTIL HIS SUPERVISORS DISCOVERED THAT HE IS GAY. AND WALL THINGS HAVE. GOTTEN BETTER THE WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT FOR LGBT POLICE EMPLOYEES AND LAW ENFORCEMENT'S EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE LGBT COMMUNITY IS NOT GOOD. WHEN COMMUNITY GROUPS SEEK TO EXCLUDE EVEN LGBT MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM PARTICIPATING PRIDE EVENTS. BECAUSE THEY LACK TRUST IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AS A WHOLE SOMETHING IS WRONG. AND WOULD HATE CRIME IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS ARE AFRAID TO CALL THE POLICE BECAUSE THEY FEAR RIDICULE SOMETHING IS WRONG. MY TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT THIRTY YEARS EXPERIENCE AS A TEACHER HAS TAUGHT ME THAT TRAINING IS THE KEY TO CHANGING THE LAW ENFORCEMENT CULTURE. AND TO BEGIN BUILDING TRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE LGBT COMMUNITY WE CAN DO THIS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL WILL GIVE US THE FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE THAT EVERY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER AND DISPATCHER OR GIVEN THE KNOWLEDGE THEY NEED TO SUPPORT LGBT CO WORKERS AND OUR COMMUNITY AND I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU YES SIR. GOOD MORNING AND I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE MY NAME'S DAMIAN SADDLE I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE TRAINING CENTER AND POLICE ACADEMY. THAT NAPA VALLEY COLLEGE. AND I'M ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY DIRECTORS' ASSOCIATION. I'M A CAREER MEMBER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HAVE AND HAVE BEEN TEACHING CULTURAL DIVERSITY IN WORKPLACE HARASSMENT PREVENTION CLASSES FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS. I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE OH FOR. THIS BILL REQUIRES A UNIQUE TRAINING SUBJECT NOT CURRENTLY COVERED. BY ANY EXISTING LAW. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA POST TRAINING AND TESTING SPECS. FOR BASIC TRAINING IN THE AREA OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND COMMUNITY POLICING MAKE NO MENTION OF LGBT PEOPLE. THE TRAINING REQUIRED BY THIS BILL CAN BE EASILY PROVIDED WITHIN THE EXISTING HOURS A BASIC TRAINING REQUIRED FOR PEACE OFFICERS AND DISPATCHERS. THERE ARE AMPLE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AROUND THE STATE. WHO ARE WILLING AND ABLE TO FACILITATE THE DELIVERY OF THIS TRAINING? THIS BILL INSURERS. NEW LAW ENFORCEMENT EMPLOYEES ENTERING THE PROFESSON WILL RECEIVE AT LEAST A FOUNDATIONAL. TRAINING ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND GENDER IDENTITY. IT ALSO ENSURES THAT THE NINETY SIX THOUSAND CURRENT EMPLOYEES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. RECEIVE A COMMON CORE CURRICULUM. AND DISPATCHERS AND OFFICERS WILL RECEIVE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MORE EFFECTIVELY SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES. THIS WILL GO A LONG WAY. TO RESTORING THE KIND OF TRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT WANTS. COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE THE BACKBONE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING. AND THERE DOES EXIST ALREADY A FUNDING MECHANISM TO HELP PAY FOR THIS TRAINING. IN FACT A NAPA VALLEY COLLEGE WE'VE ALREADY SECURED AWAY OF AND. OF USING ENHANCED NONCREDIT APPORTIONMENT. TO PROVIDE THIS TRAINING IN OUR REGION. CURRICULUM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED AND IS READY TO SHARE WITH PROVIDERS IN THE STATE. I BELIEVE IT'S TIME FOR US TO MOVE FORWARD. AND I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME HERE TODAY. THANK YOU.

GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUCH ARE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION I LET ME BE VERY CLEAR THAT WE DO NOT ARGUE WITH THAT. MORE AT TRAINING AYE REGARDING SENSITIVE SENSITIVITY TO THESE ISSUES. WILL BE USELESS WE THINK YOU'LL BE VALUABLE THAT ALSO LET ME BE VERY CLEAR. THAT GIVING AT THE COST OF DEVELOPING AND PROVIDING TRAINING AS WELL AS THE COSTS OF TRAVEL AND OFFICER BACK FAILED. THAT ARE ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH MOST TRAININGS WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT UNFUNDED MANDATE THAT THIS BILL REPRESENTS. IN CONJUNCTION WITH POSTS CURRENT FISCAL CHALLENGES AS YOU KNOW. THIS BILL WILL PUT EVEN MORE PRESSURE ON A SYSTEM THAT IS IN DESPERATE NEED OF APPROPRIATE RESOURCE SAYS. I'M ALSO WE WANNA BE CLEAR THAT. WE ARE I AM NOT SURE THAT THE TOPICS THAT ARE CONTEMPLATED BY DISPEL ARE NOT CURRENTLY THE SUBJECT OF THE VALUABLE OR REQUIRE TRAINING. SO RIGHT NOW WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THAT MEASURE AND ASKED WE ARE NOBLE THINK YOU. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARCTIC QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE COMMENT. I'D LIKE TO. GIVE YOU MAKE A QUICK COMMENT. THAT. FIRST OFF. I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR AS WAS INDICATED BY THE. OPPOSITION THAT WE ALL AGREE THAT THE LGBT POPULATION DESERVES. GREATER UNDERSTANDING AND SENSITIVITY. AND. WE WE NEED TO SUPPORT THAT EFFORT VERY GENUINELY BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT. POST FUNDS ARE IN MAJOR JEOPARDY RIGHT NOW. AND HAVING WHAT WE'RE HAVING A VERY SERIOUS. DIFFICULTY MEETING THE CURRENT OBLIGATIONS THAT. ARE ALREADY EXPECTED TO BE ACCOMPLISHED AND SO. MY OPPOSITION TO THIS IS MERELY BECAUSE I THINK THAT. THE PATHWAY IS NOT DOABLE AT THIS TIME. AND I THINK THE POST FUNDS. ARE VERY PROBLEMATIC RIGHT NOW IS THE FUNDING WITH WITH MANY THINGS ARE. AT OUR GREAT STATE BUT. AND ALSO JUST AS A CONSIDERATION PUSH FUNDS ARE USUALLY. USED FOR TRAINING. FOR PUBLIC AND I UNDERSTAND THAT LGBT IS PART OF OUR PUBLIC AS WELL. BUT I THINK. PART OF THE FOCUS OF I UNDERSTAND IT CORRECTLY USED TO ALSO ADDRESS. THE INNER WORKINGS WITH THOSE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO ARE LGBT. AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TO FOCUS ON. BUT I'M NOT SURE THE POST FUNDING IS THE WAY TO DO THAT AND SO I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOU MAY BE AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT A PATHWAY THAT. MIGHT BE A LITTLE MORE DOABLE. BECAUSE I CERTAINLY THINK THE TOPIC IS A LEGITIMATE ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEAR QUESTIONS. YOU MAY CLOSE MR LOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND OF IF AT OF VIA THE CHAIR IF I MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS YOU'RE OF MISTER LIKE IT AS WELL AS. THE EXPERT TESTIMONY VERY BRIEFLY. TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS BUT I'M JUST AS OF YESTERDAY THE COMMISSION OPPOSE CERTIFIED A COURSE. THAT MET ALL THE REQUIREMENTS AND THE TRAINING OF THE BILL AND THE CONTENT IS COMPLETING CAN BE DELIVERED. WITHIN HOURS OF FOR THE BASIC CAN CREEK ONE WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL. SUB SUPPORT NEEDED TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE FISCAL CONSIDERATIONS BUT IF I MY BILL TO ALSO AND GRIMACES TO ADDRESS ADDITIONAL CONCERNS THERE AS WELL.% THANK YOU. UP WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMMUTER COLLEGE SYSTEM HAS A FUNDING MECHANISM IN PLACE IT ALREADY PROVIDES FUNDING TO PAY FOR A GREAT DEAL OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING SUCH AS REQUIRED BY OTHER SECTIONS IN THIRTEEN FIVE NINETEEN WE THINK THIS ONE. IS ALSO APPLICABLE FOR THOSE FUNDS THERE IS AN EXISTING ONLINE COURSE THAT'S ALREADY DEVELOPED THAT COULD BE EASILY CERTIFIED AND DELIVERED. BY LOCAL TRAINING PROVIDERS WITH LITTLE OR NO IMPACT ON THE CALIFORNIA POST. THANK YOU. BOB BEGIN I WANT. RUSSIA CLOSE BUTTERY. GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF. THE CHAIR IS RECOMMENDING LIVE VOTE DO WE GET MOTION. I'M. DEVOTION THE BILL IS REMOVED AFFECTED IN THAT FACTORY CALLED ROYAL. AB TWENTY FIVE OF FOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER I TOLD HER I LACKEY. LACKEY NOCARDIA. CAVIAR AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE KILEY. KILEY NO QUIRK. I QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO AYE. THAT MEASURE PASSES REGULATIONS. AND. FINALLY ITEMS OUT TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY. AND TWENTY NINE FORTY EIGHT. THE CRICKET. THIS YEAR WE TOLD YOU LIKE FIRST. DO IT IN AMERICORPS TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY. YOU'RE MUCH. THIS BILL REMOVES A SET OF OWNERS FIREARMS REGULATIONS ON LAW ABIDING CITIZENS BY REPEALING THE MISGUIDED AND MISLEADING. UNSAFE HANDGUN LAW. THE SAFETY OF A FIREARM IN IS AND HOW IT IS USED NOT IN ITS MANUFACTURE OR ITS DESIGN. GUN CONTROL MEASURES LIKE THE UNSEEN GUN LAW DO NOT MAKE THE PUBLIC SAFER. THEY MAKE GUN CONTROL ADVOCATES FEEL GOOD ABOUT THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY THINK THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING. BUT IN REALITIES THESE LAWS ARE ONLY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR LAW ABIDING CITIZENS TO OWN A FIREARM. AND THEY DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO STOP CRIMINALS. THE TRAGEDY THE FLORIDA HIGH SCHOOL THE WE ALL WE READ THAT WELL RECENTLY WITNESSED ACROSS THE NATION. WAS THE FAILURE OF GOVERNMENT IF EXISTING LAWS IT BEEN ENFORCED THE TRAGIC WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED. IF DEPUTIES ACTUALLY DONE THEIR JOB WHEN THEY WENT TO THE THIS TROUBLED TEENS HOUSE THIRTY NINE DIFFERENT TIMES THIS TRAGEDY WOULD NOT OCCURRED. IF THE FBI HAD DONE ITS JOB IT WAS NOTIFIED THAT THERE WAS AN UNSAVED PERSON WITH UNSAVED DESIGNS. THIS TRAGEDY WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED IF THE ARM TO GET BT. THEY IT WAS OUTSIDE OF THE SCHOOL AND DID NOTHING TO HELP. THE STUDENTS IN DANGER. IF HE HAD ACTUALLY ACTED. NONE OF THESE THINGS WOULD HAPPEN. BUT LET'S BE VERY CLEAR. LAWS THAT HAMPER LEGAL GUN OWNERSHIP WHICH PROTECT PROTECTED BY THE SECOND AMENDMENT DO NOT MAKE US SAFER. THE UNSAFE HANDGUN LAW PROVIDES THE ILLUSION OF SAFETY. WHILE VIOLATING OUR CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOMS. AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY RESTORE SOME THAT LIBERTY BY REPEALING THIS MISGUIDED UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND ULTIMATELY INEFFECTIVE LA. THANK YOU YOU ARE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANNE. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IT'S GOOD AFTERNOON NOW. AMANDA WILCOX WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTERS OF THE BRADY CAMPAIGN TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE. MY PREDECESSORS WORKED EXTREMELY HARD IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES TO GET THE ORIGINAL. UNSAFE HANDGUN ACT. S. B. FIFTEEN IT WAS THEN. PASSED. AND WE HAVE FOUND THAT LAW TO BE STUNNINGLY SUCCESSFUL. FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TRUE HOPE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THAT RATE OF ACCIDENTAL SHOOTING DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA FELL BY MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT. ACCORDING TO CDC DATA THERE MAY BE MANY REASONS FOR THAT BUT I WOULD OFFER ONE OF THE REASONS IS HANDGUNS ARE NOW SAFER. DID THE ORIGINAL ACT. REQUIRE THAT HANDGUNS MEET BASIC CONSUMER SAFETY STANDARDS SUCH AS PASSING A DROP TEST. AND AND MISS OF FIRING TESTS. COMMONSENSE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUNS AND I THAT ACT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL IN. REMOVING THE. THE NUMBER OF VERY CHEAP JUNK CONSOLE CALL JUNK GUNS FOR SARAH NIGHT SPECIALS THAT WERE VERY PREVALENT AT THE TIME. AND COMMONLY USED IN CRIME SO I WOULD SAY THE LAW HAS BEEN A SUCCESS. IN ITS ORIGINAL INTENT SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE OTHER PROVISIONS WERE ADDING COLLUDED. ARE OTHER REQUIREMENTS WERE ADDED INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT FOR CHAMBER LOAD INDICATOR OR MAGAZINE. PREVENT ACCIDENTAL SHOOTINGS AND THEN LATER THE MICROSCOPIC REQUIREMENT WAS ADDED. THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE TO FURTHER PREVENT ACCIDENTS SHOOTINGS AND ACTUALLY TO HELP IN TERMS OF SOLVING CRIME. AND APPREHENDING ARMED CRIMINALS BEFORE THEY DO MORE HARM AS WE'VE DISCUSSED ALOT THAT EARLY. EARLIER HEARING REGARDING THE MICROSCOPIC REQUIREMENT. THERE'S DEBATE ON THAT OF WE DISAGREE ABOUT THAT. WHETHER IT CAN BE DONE OR NOT. AND IS CURRENTLY IN THE COURTS AND. MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO LET THE COURTS DECIDE ON THIS AND LET IT PLAY OUT WE STILL BELIEVE THAT IS VERY GOOD POLICY WANNA SEE THAT ON FUTURE FIREARMS. FOR SALE IN CALIFORNIA ARE AND I THEREFORE ASK YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IF UP HAVE OF GIFFORD'S LAW CENTER TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE MEANS ARE FAIRLY ALSO RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION. A FEDERAL LAW IMPOSES NO DESIGN SAFETY STANDARDS ON DOMESTICALLY PRODUCED FIREARMS AND THEREFORE EFFECTIVELY CREATES A PROTECTED MARKET FOR JUNK GUNS DO TO POOR CONSTRUCTION ARE DESIGNED CAN OFTEN JAN MISS FIRE OR MALFUNCTION. THREATEN THE SAFETY OF OF THE SHOOTER AND BYSTANDERS ALIKE. RESEARCHERS FROM A REPORT ON THIS TOPIC FROM JOHNS HOPKINS CENTER FOR GUN POLICY AND RESEARCH CONCLUDED THAT QUOTE ALTHOUGH UNINTENTIONAL ACCIDENTAL SHOOTINGS ACCOUNT FOR A SMALL SHARE OF FARM RELATED MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY. THESE DEATHS AND INJURIES ARE HIGHLY PREVENTABLE THROUGH PROPER DESIGN A FIREARMS. WE ARGUE THAT THE DATA SHOWS AS AMANDA MENTIONED THAT THE ANSWER CAN CONNECT TO IN CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN IMPACTFUL. WE BELIEVE ARE STATES PROGRESS IN REDUCING THE INCIDENCE OF EXCEL SHOOTING SHOULD BE CELEBRATED AND BUILT UPON NOT UNDERMINED. OR REPEALED IN ITS ENTIRETY WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL PROPOSES AND SO WE ARE REGRETFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU. ARE. THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YOU MAY CLOSE WITHOUT PAYING VERY MUCH VALUE TO SEARCH UNPROVEN CONTENTIONS THIS IS NOT ABOUT DROP TESTING UNSAFE HANDGUNS. WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IS ABOUT RESTRICTING? FIREARM SALE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE MANUFACTURER FEELING TO PAY A FEE TO PERMIT THEM TO CONTINUE TO BE SOLD OR BECAUSE THE POSTER TO OUR TWENTY THIRTEEN MAKE AND MODEL DOES NOT INCORPORATE MICROSCOPIC TECHNOLOGY. LADIES A JOURNALIST A VERY CLEAR THE UNSAFE HANDGUN ROSTER IN CALIFORNIA DOES NOTHING BUT LIMIT OUR ABILITY OF WHAT HAS LAW ABIDING. SECOND AMENDMENT HOLDING CALIFORNIA CITIZENS TO ACTUALLY ENGAGE IN OUR SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS DO NOT RIGHTS. THAT'S EXCUSE ME THESE NOT PRIVILEGES THESE OUR RIGHTS THEY SHALL BE INFRINGED. THIS LAW IS NOT ONLY. WRONG. IT IS INEFFECTIVE AND IS OVER AND CONSTITUTIONAL. I URGE YES ONE TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY. FROM FROM MR ALLIED JUST BEEN. IF YOU READ YOUR BILL AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY HAS INTRODUCED TRAVIS ALLEN FARMS AND SAFE GUNS EXISTING LAW SUBJECT TO EXCEPTIONS. GENERALLY MAKES IT AN OFFENSE TO MANUFACTURE SELL A HANDGUN THAT IS NOT SAFE. EXISTING LAWS STABS CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING IF A HANDGUN IS UNSAFE. IS LISTING LAW GENERALLY REQUIRES MANUFACTURERS TO SUBMIT SAMPLES OF NEW HANDGUN MODELS FOR TESTING TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE UNSAFE OR MAYBE APPROVED FOR SALE AS SPECIFIED. EXISTING LAW REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE COME TO COMPILE A ROSTER LISTING ALL THE HANDGUNS THAT HAVE BEEN TESTED. AND DETERMINED NOT TO BE SAFE. THIS BILL. WHAT REPEAL ALL THESE PROVISIONS? SPECIFICALLY THIS IS ABOUT UNSAFE GUNS. YOU KNOW I. I MET MY GRANDFATHER. IN. JUNE OF NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO. I LOST MY FOR GRANDFATHER IN AUGUST OF NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO. BECAUSE HIS SATURDAY NIGHT PISTOL FELL ON THE GROUND AND KILLED THEM. YET UNSAFE WEAPON. OBVIOUSLY THIS ISN'T NO FOR ME FOR PERSONAL REASONS BUT I ALSO KNOW FOR EVERYONE THAT. I'M NOT TRYING TO RESTRICT OUT THINK THIS COMMISSION RESTRICT ANYONE FROM HAVING. A FIREARM. BUT WE DEFINITELY DO NOT WANT UNSAFE FIREARMS UP THERE SO CHAIR IS RECOMMENDING A NO VOTE. THOUGH. THERE IS A MOTION. AND CHAIR CHLORAL. AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTY THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER NO JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY VOTING. LACKEY NOT VOTING GUBBIO.

RESTRICTIVE DEFINITION OF WHICH OFFENSES ARE INCLUDED WORK COMMUNICATIONS ARE PERMITTED. IT IS A LOUD LOW ROGUE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LIKE SAN FRANCISCO TO TO IMPOSE EVEN STRICTER RESTRICTIONS ON COOPERATION. AND IN DANGER THE REST OF OUR STATE BY PERMITTING INDIVIDUALS A SERIOUS FELONY CONVICTIONS TO REMAIN IN CALIFORNIA. S. B.

ANGELINA ON BEHALF OF ASIAN AMERICANS ADVANCING JUSTICE CALIFORNIA SPEAKING SOME OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY NINE FORTY A TWELVE MEMBER OF. THE STATE WHY I THOUGHT OF CALIFORNIA COALITION WHICH STRONGLY SUPPORTED SB FIFTY FOUR AND ROSA SPONSORS OF CHOI SECOND SHIFT OCT AND A BETWEEN A FORTY EIGHT IT'S CONTRARY TO EXISTING LAW THAT SETS LIMITS ON LOCAL ENTITLEMENT. WITH FEDERAL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND RAISES CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS STARTING TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN CALIFORNIA BEGAN DISENTANGLE IN STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC.

AYE WELL TRODDEN MISSION HAS RECENTLY FILED A LAWSUIT CHARLIE SHEEN PORTIONS OF AS BEFORE. IN FEDERAL COURT THIS LAWSUIT RIDLEY DOES NOT CHALLENGE PROVISION OF AS BEFORE DEPENDS ON IMMIGRATION HOLD REQUESTS. I'M CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY EXPERIENCED DEVASTATING FISCAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF ON IMMIGRATION CHRISTIAN CANNERS AS WELL AS NOTABLY THAT FEDERAL IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT ON OUR COMMUNITY THINGS REALLY HARMED OUR COMMUNITIES.
