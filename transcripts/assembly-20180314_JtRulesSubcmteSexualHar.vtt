AT THIS POINT WHEN THE NEXT

DISABILITY AFTER SPRING RECESS.

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:38.959 region:rollup2

I'M ASSEMBLY MEMBER AREAS.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.751 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR RIGHT ON A

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:12.219 region:rollup2
HAVE TO SAY THAT I REALLY I

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:15.222 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IS BEEN SUCH AN

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:16.656 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT JOINT. COMMITTEE TO

00:04:15.222 --> 00:04:18.825 region:rollup2
TACKLE SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE.

00:04:16.656 --> 00:04:20.827 region:rollup2
UP AS WAS MENTIONED.

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:22.762 region:rollup2
BY SENATOR MITCHELL WE'VE HEARD

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:24.531 region:rollup2
FROM TWENTY ONE TWENTY ONE

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:26.700 region:rollup2
TWENTY ONE EXPERTS AND WE'VE

00:04:24.531 --> 00:04:27.334 region:rollup2
LEARNED SO MUCH I THINK ONE OF

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.301 region:rollup2
THE.

00:04:27.334 --> 00:04:30.570 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE KEY THINGS LIKE MY

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:32.639 region:rollup2
TAKE AWAY IS THE NEED FOR THE

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.608 region:rollup2
CHANGE IN CULTURE. I THINK THAT

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.810 region:rollup2
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND I

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:39.279 region:rollup2
THINK THAT I ONE. DAY I WANTED

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.514 region:rollup2
TO COMMENT ALSO THAT. WE FOUNDED

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.815 region:rollup2
THAT'S OR LEAST I FOUND THAT

00:04:40.514 --> 00:04:44.050 region:rollup2
THERE IS SUCH A DIFFERENCE

00:04:41.815 --> 00:04:46.453 region:rollup2
BETWEEN MANAGING AN OFFICE OR

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.655 region:rollup2
MANAGING AN INSTITUTION. AND

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:50.791 region:rollup2
SHOWING LEADERSHIP IN AN OFFICE

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:52.459 region:rollup2
OR IN AN INSTITUTION. I THINK

00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:54.327 region:rollup2
THE THE THE EMPHASIS HAS TO BE

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:56.763 region:rollup2
IN LEADERSHIP AND SETTING THE

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:58.665 region:rollup2
TONE WHETHER IT'S IN IN THIS

00:04:56.763 --> 00:05:00.967 region:rollup2
INSTITUTION OR IN OUR RESPECTIVE

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:04.171 region:rollup2
OFFICES. AND FROM THAT WE

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:04.738 region:rollup2
LEARNED SO MUCH BECAUSE IT SETS

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:04.971 region:rollup2
THE TONE FOR THE REST OF THE

00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:05.772 region:rollup2
STAFF.

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:07.274 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:09.643 region:rollup2
THANK YOU SENATOR MORLOCK THANK

00:05:07.274 --> 00:05:10.677 region:rollup2

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:12.946 region:rollup2
MITCHELL ANSWERED MY QUESTION.

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:13.914 region:rollup2
BUT MAYBE I COULD.

00:05:12.946 --> 00:05:15.782 region:rollup2
ASK A LITTLE MORE.

00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:18.218 region:rollup2
.

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:20.520 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SELECTED A VENDOR YES

00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:22.822 region:rollup2
AND DO WE HAVE A TIME LINE

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.957 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC.

00:05:22.822 --> 00:05:25.759 region:rollup2
LET ME GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT

00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:28.395 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I I DON'T KNOW THAT WAS

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:29.229 region:rollup2
A PART OF THE INITIAL SCOPE OF

00:05:28.395 --> 00:05:31.331 region:rollup2
WORK.

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:33.066 region:rollup2
I'M ASSUMING IN SOME OF THE

00:05:31.331 --> 00:05:34.668 region:rollup2
CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS THAT MAY

00:05:33.066 --> 00:05:37.003 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN A PART OF IT WE'VE NOT

00:05:34.668 --> 00:05:39.806 region:rollup2
BEEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THAT.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:43.176 region:rollup2
RULES PASS.

00:05:39.806 --> 00:05:44.644 region:rollup2
BUT I AM NOW INSERTING MYSELF

00:05:43.176 --> 00:05:46.146 region:rollup2
UP TO CLEAN GIVEN THE DELAY AND

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:47.881 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT IT'S HAVING ON THE

00:05:46.146 --> 00:05:50.016 region:rollup2
WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND SO

00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:52.219 region:rollup2
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:55.222 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW WHAT WITH REGARD

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:56.823 region:rollup2
TO TIMELINE. AS MYSTERY OF SAID

00:05:55.222 --> 00:05:59.192 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW I I THINK WE ALL HAVE

00:05:56.823 --> 00:06:01.294 region:rollup2
HEARD IN AGREE THAT CULTURE AND

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:02.362 region:rollup2
CULTURE SHIFT IS AN INTEGRAL

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:03.763 region:rollup2

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:42.802 region:rollup2
I WOULDN'T BE HERE SPEAKING TO

IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM.

00:11:57.450 --> 00:12:01.387 region:rollup2
SURE BELIEVES THE ONE MAJOR STEP

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:02.722 region:rollup2
IN FIXING THE BROKEN SYSTEM.

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:04.424 region:rollup2
THAT THE LET THE CALIFORNIA

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:05.959 region:rollup2
LEGISLATORS FACING IS TO

00:12:04.424 --> 00:12:07.193 region:rollup2

00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:11.397 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINER SUCH

00:12:09.963 --> 00:12:12.865 region:rollup2

CONDUCTING WORKPLACE TRAINING

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:16.569 region:rollup2
SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY.

00:12:14.701 --> 00:12:18.137 region:rollup2
OVER TIME WE HAVE SEEN AWARENESS

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:20.573 region:rollup2
OF THE EMPLOYEE AND SUPERVISOR

00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:22.308 region:rollup2

00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:23.910 region:rollup2
SENIOR MANAGEMENT LEVEL.

00:12:22.308 --> 00:12:25.445 region:rollup2
WITH THE PASSAGE OF AB EIGHTEEN

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.380 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE IN TWO THOUSAND SIX

00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:28.448 region:rollup2
SENIOR MANAGERS. HAVE BEEN

REQUIRED TO TAKE SEXUAL

00:12:28.448 --> 00:12:31.351 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT TRAINING EVERY TWO

00:12:29.515 --> 00:12:32.752 region:rollup2
YEARS.

00:12:31.351 --> 00:12:34.420 region:rollup2
SINCE THE LAW'S ENACTMENT ARE

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:36.122 region:rollup2
PRACTICES SEEN A SIGNIFICANT

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.691 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT IN SENIOR MANAGEMENT

00:12:36.122 --> 00:12:39.859 region:rollup2
AWARENESS OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS.

00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:41.494 region:rollup2
IF ANY TRAINING IS TO BE

00:12:39.859 --> 00:12:42.862 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL SENIOR MANAGEMENT

00:12:41.494 --> 00:12:44.564 region:rollup2
AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF

00:12:42.862 --> 00:12:46.666 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING IS

00:12:44.564 --> 00:12:48.268 region:rollup2
NECESSARY.

00:12:46.666 --> 00:12:50.036 region:rollup2
THE FOLLOWING ARE AYS IN WHICH

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:52.338 region:rollup2
AN ORGANIZATION CAN CREATE AN

00:12:50.036 --> 00:12:54.674 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THE SUCCESSFUL.

00:12:52.338 --> 00:12:56.142 region:rollup2
TRAINING PROGRAM.

00:12:54.674 --> 00:12:58.211 region:rollup2
SO WE NEED MANAGEMENT BY END AT

00:12:56.142 --> 00:12:59.479 region:rollup2
THIS TIME IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY

00:12:58.211 --> 00:13:01.080 region:rollup2
MORE THAN ANY TIME BEFORE WE ARE

00:12:59.479 --> 00:13:02.415 region:rollup2
FINDING THAT SENIOR MANAGERS ARE

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.183 region:rollup2
TAKING A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN THE

00:13:02.415 --> 00:13:05.952 region:rollup2
TRAINING AND TAKING A PROACTIVE

00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:07.687 region:rollup2
ROLE IN SUPPORTING. A RESPECTFUL

00:13:05.952 --> 00:13:09.155 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

00:13:07.687 --> 00:13:10.289 region:rollup2
WHEN LEADERSHIP TAKES ON THE

00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:12.759 region:rollup2
ROLE OF MODELING OR CIRCLE A

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:14.460 region:rollup2
RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE THE REST OF

00:13:12.759 --> 00:13:16.729 region:rollup2
THE WORKPLACE WILL FOLLOW.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.196 region:rollup2
AS OUR ELECTED STATE LEGISLATORS

00:13:16.729 --> 00:13:18.631 region:rollup2
WE LOOK TO YOU FOR OUR

00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:20.299 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:21.934 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY HERE IN THE CAPITAL BUT

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:23.336 region:rollup2
THROUGHOUT OUR STATE.

00:13:21.934 --> 00:13:24.470 region:rollup2
ATTENDING AND PARTICIPATING IN

00:13:23.336 --> 00:13:26.172 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING IS

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.940 region:rollup2
ELECTED OFFICIALS WILL SEND A

00:13:26.172 --> 00:13:29.409 region:rollup2
STRONG MESSAGE.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.177 region:rollup2
BUT THE LEGISLATOR TAKES THIS

00:13:29.409 --> 00:13:32.745 region:rollup2
ISSUE SERIOUSLY.

00:13:31.177 --> 00:13:34.614 region:rollup2
SO TOO WILL ENSURING THAT SENIOR

00:13:32.745 --> 00:13:36.349 region:rollup2
LEVEL EMPLOYEES FULLY

00:13:34.614 --> 00:13:38.084 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN TRAINING WHEN

00:13:36.349 --> 00:13:39.185 region:rollup2
SENIOR STAFF EVADE TRAINING ON

00:13:38.084 --> 00:13:40.653 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT DO TO WORKLOAD

00:13:39.185 --> 00:13:43.122 region:rollup2
SCHEDULING CONFLICTS OR OTHER

00:13:40.653 --> 00:13:43.990 region:rollup2
STATED REASONS. EMPLOYEES NOT

00:13:43.122 --> 00:13:45.925 region:rollup2
ONLY DISMISS THE TRAINING AS

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.760 region:rollup2
WELL BUT THEY MAY NOT TAKE ANY

00:13:45.925 --> 00:13:49.195 region:rollup2
TRAINING. BURKE HARASSING

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.630 region:rollup2
CONDUCT IN THE WORKPLACE

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:51.497 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY EITHER.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.499 region:rollup2
IN ORDER FOR TRAINING TO BE

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:56.302 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE IT MUST BE ENDORSED BY

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:57.603 region:rollup2
THE LEADERS.

00:13:56.302 --> 00:14:00.073 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALSO SEEN THAT LIVE

00:13:57.603 --> 00:14:00.573 region:rollup2
TRAINEES HAS HAS EXCEEDED ONLINE

00:14:00.073 --> 00:14:02.208 region:rollup2
TRAINING INEFFECTIVENESS

00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:03.509 region:rollup2
OVERALL.

00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:05.011 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THIS IS DUE TO THE

00:14:03.509 --> 00:14:06.379 region:rollup2
INTERACTION OF THE LIVE CLASS

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:08.414 region:rollup2
AND THE ABILITY OF PARTICIPANTS

00:14:06.379 --> 00:14:10.149 region:rollup2
TO ASK QUESTIONS RECEIVE ANSWERS

00:14:08.414 --> 00:14:11.984 region:rollup2
ENGAGE IN DISCUSSION IN REAL

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:13.886 region:rollup2
TIME.

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:15.521 region:rollup2
SOME COMPANIES HAVE SUCCESS HAVE

00:14:13.886 --> 00:14:16.789 region:rollup2
SEEN SUCCESS A BLENDED APPROACH

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:17.290 region:rollup2
AND THAT INCLUDES SOME LIFE

00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:18.758 region:rollup2
TRAINING AND SOME ONLINE

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.992 region:rollup2
TRAINING.

00:14:18.758 --> 00:14:21.561 region:rollup2
THE ONLINE TRAINING CAN BE USED

00:14:19.992 --> 00:14:23.363 region:rollup2
A SUNDAY UNIFORM MESSAGE ACROSS

00:14:21.561 --> 00:14:24.931 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION AND

00:14:23.363 --> 00:14:26.299 region:rollup2
REACH SOME EMPLOYEES THAT DO TO

00:14:24.931 --> 00:14:28.167 region:rollup2
UNIQUE SCHEDULES WOULD NOT BE

00:14:26.299 --> 00:14:29.936 region:rollup2
ABLE TO TAKE THE LIVE TRAINING.

00:14:28.167 --> 00:14:31.270 region:rollup2
DURING NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS.

00:14:29.936 --> 00:14:32.872 region:rollup2
THE LIVE TRAINING COMPONENT CAN

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:34.841 region:rollup2
THEN BE USED TO BUILD OFF THE

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:36.275 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION STEP BY THE ONLINE

00:14:34.841 --> 00:14:37.810 region:rollup2
TRAINING. WITHOUT THE SPECIAL

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:39.445 region:rollup2
NEEDS OF A LARGER REMOTE

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.780 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD

00:14:39.445 --> 00:14:42.315 region:rollup2
STRONGLY CONSIDER CONDUCTING

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.083 region:rollup2
LIVE TRAINING TO ALLOW FOR MORE

00:14:42.315 --> 00:14:46.652 region:rollup2
ROBUST INTERACTION BETWEEN

00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:48.187 region:rollup2
TRAINER IN PARTICIPANTS.

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:49.956 region:rollup2
WE ALSO WANT ADDRESS BYSTANDER

00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:51.090 region:rollup2
TRAINING IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT

00:14:49.956 --> 00:14:52.392 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES FREQUENTLY BECOME

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:55.094 region:rollup2
AWARE OF HARASSMENT ISSUES LONG

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:56.963 region:rollup2
BEFORE MANAGEMENT.

00:14:55.094 --> 00:14:58.498 region:rollup2
YET THEY OFTEN FAIL TO REPORT.

00:14:56.963 --> 00:15:00.066 region:rollup2
THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR THIS

00:14:58.498 --> 00:15:00.833 region:rollup2
OUR RELUCTANCE TO BECOME

00:15:00.066 --> 00:15:02.668 region:rollup2
INVOLVED LEST THEY BECOME THE

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:04.036 region:rollup2
TARGET.

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:06.005 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTIONS OF SOMEONE ELSE WILL

00:15:04.036 --> 00:15:09.275 region:rollup2
REPORT IT.

00:15:06.005 --> 00:15:10.910 region:rollup2
UNAWARE OF REPORTING PROCESS.

00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:12.011 region:rollup2
AND THE MERE THEIR PEERS SO OF

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.913 region:rollup2
THEIR PEERS STAY SILENT SO WILL

00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:15.915 region:rollup2
THEY.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:17.450 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES NEED TO BE TRAINED ON

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.851 region:rollup2
THEIR ROLES AS BYSTANDERS IN THE

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:20.553 region:rollup2
AVENUES THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE

00:15:18.851 --> 00:15:22.722 region:rollup2
TO THEM FOR REPORTING ANY

00:15:20.553 --> 00:15:24.123 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE HARASSMENT.

00:15:22.722 --> 00:15:24.891 region:rollup2
TRAINING PROGRAMS NEED TO

00:15:24.123 --> 00:15:26.859 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE EMPLOYEES

00:15:24.891 --> 00:15:28.961 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES IN HELPING TO

00:15:26.859 --> 00:15:30.663 region:rollup2
FOSTER HARASSMENT FREE WORKPLACE

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:33.733 region:rollup2
HOW EMPLOYEES FILE REPORT AND

00:15:30.663 --> 00:15:35.435 region:rollup2
THE INSURANCE OF NO RETALIATION.

00:15:33.733 --> 00:15:36.803 region:rollup2
BYSTANDER TRAINING CAN EASILY BE

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:37.904 region:rollup2
INCORPORATED INTO THE HARASSMENT

00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:39.505 region:rollup2
PREVENTION TRAINING WHICH

00:15:37.904 --> 00:15:43.209 region:rollup2
ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR

00:15:39.505 --> 00:15:44.410 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL TRAINING COURSES.

00:15:43.209 --> 00:15:46.712 region:rollup2
SO WE ALSO HAVE THE ISSUE OF

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.814 region:rollup2
IMPLICIT BIAS.

00:15:46.712 --> 00:15:49.515 region:rollup2
AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE

00:15:47.814 --> 00:15:50.783 region:rollup2
UNCONSCIOUS IMPLICIT BIASES THAT

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:52.351 region:rollup2
EVERYONE BRINGS INTO THE

00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:54.353 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE AND THAT TRAINING IN

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:56.355 region:rollup2
THIS AREA IS NECESSARY. FOR

00:15:54.353 --> 00:15:57.557 region:rollup2
CREATING A POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT.

00:15:56.355 --> 00:15:58.958 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THE TRAINING WE HAVE

00:15:57.557 --> 00:16:01.494 region:rollup2
SEEN IN THE PAST HAS FOCUSED ON

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:03.029 region:rollup2
DEFINING WHAT IMPLICIT BIAS IS

00:16:01.494 --> 00:16:03.763 region:rollup2
AND TELLING PEOPLE THAT THEY

00:16:03.029 --> 00:16:05.665 region:rollup2
NEED TO BE AWARE OF THEIR

00:16:03.763 --> 00:16:07.133 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR. AND THAT IT MAY BE A

00:16:05.665 --> 00:16:08.935 region:rollup2
PRO BEEN APPROPRIATE.

00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:09.502 region:rollup2
HOWEVER EFFECTIVE TRAINING NEEDS

00:16:08.935 --> 00:16:10.703 region:rollup2
TO BE MORE THAN JUST SIMPLE

00:16:09.502 --> 00:16:12.405 region:rollup2
AWARENESS.

00:16:10.703 --> 00:16:14.474 region:rollup2
IT MUST INCORPORATE METHODS FOR

00:16:12.405 --> 00:16:16.142 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING WHAT IMPLICIT BIAS

00:16:14.474 --> 00:16:17.510 region:rollup2
LOOKS LIKE IN ACTION.

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:18.544 region:rollup2
AND THE OPPORTUNITIES TO PUT

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.745 region:rollup2
INTO PRACTICE A DIFFERENT

00:16:18.544 --> 00:16:21.280 region:rollup2
APPROACH THAT HELPS EMPLOYEES TO

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:22.248 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:23.416 region:rollup2
TRAINING PARTNERED WITH AN

00:16:22.248 --> 00:16:24.584 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT THE VALUES EACH

00:16:23.416 --> 00:16:25.852 region:rollup2
PERSON EQUALLY AND THE

00:16:24.584 --> 00:16:27.353 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP THAT FOSTERS A

00:16:25.852 --> 00:16:28.955 region:rollup2
RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE ON ALL

00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:32.425 region:rollup2
LEVELS WILL PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT

00:16:28.955 --> 00:16:35.328 region:rollup2
AND SUSTAINABLE CHANGE.

00:16:32.425 --> 00:16:36.596 region:rollup2
SO I CAUTION YOU.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:37.830 region:rollup2
AGAINST USING COST AS A

00:16:36.596 --> 00:16:40.600 region:rollup2
DETERMINING FACTOR WHEN YOU'RE

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:42.268 region:rollup2
CHOOSING A TRAINING PROP FORM.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.103 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE TRAINING SHOULD

00:16:42.268 --> 00:16:46.505 region:rollup2
INVOLVE ALL HAVE HOLES OF

00:16:44.103 --> 00:16:49.041 region:rollup2
PERSONNEL INCLUDING INTERNS PAID

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:50.276 region:rollup2
STAFF AND ELECTED OFFICIALS.

00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:51.544 region:rollup2
TRAINING FOR MANAGERS AND

00:16:50.276 --> 00:16:53.312 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVES HOWEVER SHOULD BE

00:16:51.544 --> 00:16:53.946 region:rollup2
SEPARATE SHOULD BE SEPARATE FROM

00:16:53.312 --> 00:16:55.514 region:rollup2
THE TRAINING FOR THE REST OF THE

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:56.983 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES.

00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:58.618 region:rollup2
AS MUCH AS YOU MAY WANT TO

00:16:56.983 --> 00:16:59.952 region:rollup2
CREATE A UNIFORM PROGRAM.

00:16:58.618 --> 00:17:01.988 region:rollup2
MANAGERS HAVE SPECIAL

00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:02.588 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES AND NEED TO BE

00:17:01.988 --> 00:17:04.323 region:rollup2
EDUCATED ON THESE

EMPLOYEES.

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:13.499 region:rollup2
SO HOW DO WE OVERCOME TRAINING

00:17:11.564 --> 00:17:14.967 region:rollup2
OBSTACLES WILL. AT IT ONE OF THE

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:17.069 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT MANY ORGANIZATIONS

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:18.404 region:rollup2
RUN INTO WITH REGARD TO SEXUAL

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:20.406 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT TRAINING IS BOREDOM.

00:17:18.404 --> 00:17:21.407 region:rollup2
REDUNDANCY.

00:17:20.406 --> 00:17:22.909 region:rollup2
OR A LACKLUSTER ATTITUDE FROM

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:25.244 region:rollup2
THE EMPLOYEES.

00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:26.679 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED.

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:27.880 region:rollup2
ONE SOLUTION IS TO SPREAD

00:17:26.679 --> 00:17:29.515 region:rollup2
TRAINING OVER THREE OR MORE

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.083 region:rollup2
SHORT WORKSHOPS THAT ARE HELD

00:17:29.515 --> 00:17:32.985 region:rollup2
ONCE PER QUARTER INSTEAD OF ONE

00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:34.887 region:rollup2
LONG DAY OF TRAINING.

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:36.289 region:rollup2
SOME ORGANIZATIONS HAVE ENTICED

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:37.723 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES AND OFFERED BREAKFAST

00:17:36.289 --> 00:17:40.059 region:rollup2
OR LUNCH OR EVEN DRAWINGS FOR

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:41.294 region:rollup2
GIFT CARDS.

00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:42.428 region:rollup2
AND AS I STATED EARLIER

00:17:41.294 --> 00:17:43.496 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES WILL ASSUME THE

00:17:42.428 --> 00:17:44.964 region:rollup2
ATTITUDE OF THE LEADERS IN THE

00:17:43.496 --> 00:17:47.166 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION IF THEY SEE THE

00:17:44.964 --> 00:17:49.769 region:rollup2

TRAINING. THEY WILL FOLLOW.

00:17:49.769 --> 00:17:53.172 region:rollup2
SO TO CONCLUDE THERE IS NO DOUBT

00:17:51.938 --> 00:17:54.807 region:rollup2
THAT TRAINING IS AN INTEGRAL

00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:56.542 region:rollup2
PART OF ERADICATING HARASSMENT

00:17:54.807 --> 00:17:57.910 region:rollup2

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:16.542 region:rollup2
TRAINING.

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:18.277 region:rollup2
MANDATES SINCE AS I PREVIOUSLY

00:21:16.542 --> 00:21:19.545 region:rollup2
MENTIONED IN MY ROLE AS A MEMBER

00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:21.413 region:rollup2

AUTHOR OF IMPLEMENTING

00:21:22.581 --> 00:21:26.152 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS RELATED TO THESE

00:21:23.883 --> 00:21:27.853 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS. AND I ALSO HELPED

00:21:26.152 --> 00:21:29.588 region:rollup2
DRAFT REGULATIONS RELATED TO

SEXUAL HARASSMENT GENDER

00:21:29.588 --> 00:21:32.658 region:rollup2
IDENTITY AND GENDER EXPRESSION.

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:33.359 region:rollup2
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER SPECIFIC

00:21:32.658 --> 00:21:36.262 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS BUT IN THE INTEREST OF

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:37.696 region:rollup2
TIME ALL MOVE ON TO HOW WE GOT

00:21:36.262 --> 00:21:39.365 region:rollup2
HERE AND HOW WE CAN MAKE THINGS

00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:42.301 region:rollup2
BETTER.

00:21:39.365 --> 00:21:44.670 region:rollup2
SO FIRST WHAT HASN'T WORKED.

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:45.704 region:rollup2
MIMI NERD BY NATURE SO WHEN

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.373 region:rollup2
ADDITION TO BEING.

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:49.842 region:rollup2
AN EMPLOYMENT ATTORNEY I ALSO

00:21:47.373 --> 00:21:51.377 region:rollup2
HAVE BECOME VERY WELL VERSED IN

00:21:49.842 --> 00:21:53.679 region:rollup2
PSYCHOLOGY AND OTHER.

00:21:51.377 --> 00:21:55.714 region:rollup2
AREAS SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY THAT

00:21:53.679 --> 00:21:56.815 region:rollup2
TALK ABOUT OTHER OF RESEARCH

00:21:55.714 --> 00:21:59.251 region:rollup2
THESE TOPICS.

00:21:56.815 --> 00:22:00.052 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE

00:21:59.251 --> 00:22:01.554 region:rollup2
KNOW.

00:22:00.052 --> 00:22:03.656 region:rollup2
HAVE GOTTEN US WHERE WE ARE

00:22:01.554 --> 00:22:05.157 region:rollup2
TODAY AND WHAT DOESN'T WORK IN

00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:06.859 region:rollup2
TERMS OF TRAINING INCLUDE.

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:08.394 region:rollup2
NUMBER ONE A CHECK THE BOX

00:22:06.859 --> 00:22:10.362 region:rollup2
MENTALITY.

00:22:08.394 --> 00:22:10.930 region:rollup2
SO TRAINING HAS BEEN INEFFECTIVE

00:22:10.362 --> 00:22:12.631 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT HAS FOR THE MOST

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:14.700 region:rollup2
PART.

00:22:12.631 --> 00:22:16.335 region:rollup2
FOCUS SOLELY ON ISSUES RELATED

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.570 region:rollup2
TO LEGAL COMPLIANCE.

00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:19.738 region:rollup2
THIS CONCLUSION WAS EXPRESSED

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:21.273 region:rollup2
POWERFULLY IN A TWO THOUSAND

00:22:19.738 --> 00:22:23.309 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN REPORT ISSUED BY THE

00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:24.910 region:rollup2
EEOC SELECT TASK FORCE ON

00:22:23.309 --> 00:22:25.945 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT PREVENTION.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:27.780 region:rollup2
WHEN THE MESSAGE GIVEN TO

00:22:25.945 --> 00:22:29.582 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES IS THAT WERE ONLY

00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.649 region:rollup2
INTERESTED IN COMPLYING WITH THE

00:22:29.582 --> 00:22:32.418 region:rollup2
MINIMUM LEGAL STANDARDS BUT

00:22:30.649 --> 00:22:33.452 region:rollup2
NOTHING ELSE.

00:22:32.418 --> 00:22:35.854 region:rollup2
THE DATA SHOWS THAT THE TRAINING

00:22:33.452 --> 00:22:36.622 region:rollup2
WILL NOT ONLY BE INEFFECTIVE BUT

00:22:35.854 --> 00:22:39.291 region:rollup2
WILL ACTUALLY HAVE A BACKLASH

00:22:36.622 --> 00:22:40.559 region:rollup2
EFFECT.

00:22:39.291 --> 00:22:42.328 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ROOT CAUSE IS STANDALONE

00:22:40.559 --> 00:22:44.029 region:rollup2
TRAINING.

00:22:42.328 --> 00:22:45.564 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT PREVENTION TRAINING

00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:47.700 region:rollup2
DOES NOT ACHIEVE THE DESIRED

00:22:45.564 --> 00:22:49.635 region:rollup2
EFFECT IF IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.537 region:rollup2
INCLUSION OF NECESSARY TOPICS

00:22:49.635 --> 00:22:52.838 region:rollup2
SUCH AS IMPLICIT BIAS. DIVERSITY

00:22:51.537 --> 00:22:54.840 region:rollup2
IN EQUITY.

00:22:52.838 --> 00:22:56.775 region:rollup2
ABILITY AND RESPECT.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.377 region:rollup2
BYSTANDER TRAINING COMMUNICATION

00:22:56.775 --> 00:23:00.145 region:rollup2
TRAINING AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION

00:22:58.377 --> 00:23:01.447 region:rollup2
TRAINING.

00:23:00.145 --> 00:23:02.848 region:rollup2
SINCE THESE TOPICS CAN'T BE

00:23:01.447 --> 00:23:05.184 region:rollup2
COVERED IN THE REQUIRED TWO

00:23:02.848 --> 00:23:06.585 region:rollup2
HOURS THREE USUALLY IGNORED.

00:23:05.184 --> 00:23:09.355 region:rollup2
THAT ALL EMPLOYEES AND MANAGERS

00:23:06.585 --> 00:23:12.124 region:rollup2
LEARN. IS THE LEGAL LANGUAGE OF

00:23:09.355 --> 00:23:13.959 region:rollup2
UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT.

00:23:12.124 --> 00:23:15.694 region:rollup2
UNREALISTIC EXAMPLES. WE HEAR

00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:17.263 region:rollup2
OVER AND OVER FROM EMPLOYEES AND

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:20.332 region:rollup2
MANAGERS ALIKE THAT WORKPLACE

00:23:17.263 --> 00:23:23.202 region:rollup2
SCENARIOS WHETHER LIVOR ONLINE.

00:23:20.332 --> 00:23:24.703 region:rollup2
INCLUDE UNREALISTIC EXAGGERATED

00:23:23.202 --> 00:23:26.605 region:rollup2
AND OBVIOUS EXAMPLES OF

00:23:24.703 --> 00:23:27.873 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE MISCONDUCT.

00:23:26.605 --> 00:23:29.675 region:rollup2
WORDS I'VE HEARD TO DESCRIBE

00:23:27.873 --> 00:23:30.709 region:rollup2
THIS TYPE OF TRAINING WILL RANGE

00:23:29.675 --> 00:23:32.778 region:rollup2
FROM BORING.

00:23:30.709 --> 00:23:34.847 region:rollup2
CHEESY.

00:23:32.778 --> 00:23:36.348 region:rollup2
AND THEY ALL POINT TO A FEELER

00:23:34.847 --> 00:23:38.017 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY TO PAY ATTENTION BUT

00:23:36.348 --> 00:23:39.518 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THERE'S NO LEARNING

00:23:38.017 --> 00:23:40.085 region:rollup2
BEING INVOLVED WINDOWS OF THE

00:23:39.518 --> 00:23:41.487 region:rollup2
TYPES OF SCENARIOS THAT ARE

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:43.756 region:rollup2
BEING USED.

00:23:41.487 --> 00:23:45.624 region:rollup2
ANOTHER IS NOT BEING FOCUSED ON

00:23:43.756 --> 00:23:47.192 region:rollup2
TRUE UNDERSTANDING. AND BEHAVIOR

00:23:45.624 --> 00:23:48.294 region:rollup2
CHANGE

00:23:47.192 --> 00:23:50.129 region:rollup2
THE RESEARCH SHOWS IS THAT

00:23:48.294 --> 00:23:52.331 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT THAT PUTS THE BLAME

00:23:50.129 --> 00:23:54.066 region:rollup2
ON ONE SIDE AND FAILS TO PROMOTE

00:23:52.331 --> 00:23:55.834 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING EMPATHY AND

00:23:54.066 --> 00:23:58.270 region:rollup2
CLARITY. HAS ZERO EFFECT ON

00:23:55.834 --> 00:24:00.439 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR.

00:23:58.270 --> 00:24:02.975 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ISSUE IS THE LACK OF

00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:05.911 region:rollup2
AUTHENTICITY.

00:24:02.975 --> 00:24:07.179 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE WHO AREN SUCCEED AND

00:24:05.911 --> 00:24:08.614 region:rollup2
TRADING IS BECAUSE THEY ALREADY

00:24:07.179 --> 00:24:11.016 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IF THEY WORK FOR AN

00:24:08.614 --> 00:24:12.518 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION THAT VALUES AT SIX

00:24:11.016 --> 00:24:14.320 region:rollup2
RESPECT AND INCLUSION.

00:24:12.518 --> 00:24:15.187 region:rollup2
WITHOUT THAT FOUNDATION THE

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.722 region:rollup2
TRAINING IS VIEWED AS

00:24:15.187 --> 00:24:18.524 region:rollup2
INAUTHENTIC AND IS THEREFORE

00:24:16.722 --> 00:24:19.892 region:rollup2
INEFFECTIVE.

00:24:18.524 --> 00:24:21.760 region:rollup2
AND ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT WHERE

00:24:19.892 --> 00:24:23.929 region:rollup2
THE VIEW IS THAT REPORTING IS

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:25.564 region:rollup2
FUTILE.

00:24:23.929 --> 00:24:28.400 region:rollup2
ASK YOURSELF DO YOU HAVE A

00:24:25.564 --> 00:24:31.270 region:rollup2
POSITIVE CYCLE OF REPORTING

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:32.504 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATING AND RESOLVING.

00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.605 region:rollup2
IF NOT THEN EMPLOYEES ARE GONNA

00:24:32.504 --> 00:24:35.674 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IT THEIR COMPLAINTS WILL

00:24:33.605 --> 00:24:37.676 region:rollup2
BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND TRAINING

00:24:35.674 --> 00:24:40.679 region:rollup2
IN THIS ENVIRONMENT DOES NOTHING

00:24:37.676 --> 00:24:42.281 region:rollup2
TO MOVE THE NEEDLE.

00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:43.916 region:rollup2
WHAT'S CHANGED WHY ARE WE HERE

00:24:42.281 --> 00:24:45.150 region:rollup2
TODAY.

00:24:43.916 --> 00:24:47.019 region:rollup2
SO NOT EVERYTHING THAT IS FACE

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:49.888 region:rollup2
CAN BE CHANGED BUT NOTHING CAN

00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:51.190 region:rollup2
BE CHANGED UNTIL IT IS FACED.

00:24:49.888 --> 00:24:53.625 region:rollup2
AND ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CERTAINLY

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:56.528 region:rollup2
A NUMBER OF LEGAL SOCIOLOGICAL

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:57.863 region:rollup2
HISTORICAL. AND OTHER ROOT

00:24:56.528 --> 00:24:59.598 region:rollup2
CAUSES.

00:24:57.863 --> 00:25:02.067 region:rollup2
THAT EXPLAINED THIS VERY COMPLEX

00:24:59.598 --> 00:25:03.736 region:rollup2
ISSUE. WE NEED TO FACE THE

00:25:02.067 --> 00:25:05.838 region:rollup2
REALITY THAT TODAY.

00:25:03.736 --> 00:25:08.207 region:rollup2
WE ARE AT A VERY IMPORTANT

00:25:05.838 --> 00:25:09.908 region:rollup2
MOMENT IN TIME.

00:25:08.207 --> 00:25:11.176 region:rollup2
SO AS I MENTIONED AT THE OUTSET

00:25:09.908 --> 00:25:13.278 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MANY HATS I'VE WORN

00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:13.812 region:rollup2
DURING MY PROFESSIONAL CAREER IS

00:25:13.278 --> 00:25:14.513 region:rollup2
THAT OF WORKPLACE PROBLEM

00:25:13.812 --> 00:25:16.248 region:rollup2
SOLVER.

00:25:14.513 --> 00:25:18.117 region:rollup2
I CONDUCTED IN EXCESS OF TWELVE

00:25:16.248 --> 00:25:19.585 region:rollup2
HUNDRED WORKPLACE INVESTIGATIONS

00:25:18.117 --> 00:25:21.587 region:rollup2
DURING MY CAREER.

00:25:19.585 --> 00:25:23.088 region:rollup2
I HAVE A LOT OF STORIES.

00:25:21.587 --> 00:25:25.090 region:rollup2
MY INVESTIGATIONS COVER EVERY

00:25:23.088 --> 00:25:26.892 region:rollup2
TYPE OF SEXUAL HARASSER EVERY

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:29.495 region:rollup2
TYPE OF ALLEGATION AND MOST OF

00:25:26.892 --> 00:25:31.830 region:rollup2
THEM CONCERN SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

00:25:29.495 --> 00:25:33.298 region:rollup2
AND WHILE I'VE HAD EVERY VERSION

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:35.601 region:rollup2
OF ALLEGATION YOU CAN IMAGINE.

00:25:33.298 --> 00:25:37.069 region:rollup2
INVOLVING DIFFERENT GENDERS

00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:38.570 region:rollup2
INVOLVING SAME GENDER ETCETERA.

00:25:37.069 --> 00:25:40.906 region:rollup2
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:42.674 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT CLAIMS STILL HAVE TWO

00:25:40.906 --> 00:25:43.709 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS IN COMMON.

00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:45.110 region:rollup2
THE PERSON COMPLAINING IS A

00:25:43.709 --> 00:25:45.944 region:rollup2
WOMAN.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:47.846 region:rollup2
AND THE PERSON THEY'RE

00:25:45.944 --> 00:25:50.949 region:rollup2
COMPLAINING ABOUT IS A MAN IN A

00:25:47.846 --> 00:25:51.617 region:rollup2
GREATER POSITION OF POWER.

00:25:50.949 --> 00:25:53.786 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT AS A BACK TO BACK

00:25:51.617 --> 00:25:55.287 region:rollup2
DROP HERE'S SOME OF THE ISSUES

00:25:53.786 --> 00:25:56.054 region:rollup2
THAT I'VE SEEN OVER AND OVER

00:25:55.287 --> 00:25:58.257 region:rollup2
AGAIN IN THE WORKPLACE THAT I

00:25:56.054 --> 00:26:00.259 region:rollup2
THINK EXPLAIN HOW WE GET TO THIS

00:25:58.257 --> 00:26:01.593 region:rollup2
ME TO IN TIMES OF MOMENT THAT WE

00:26:00.259 --> 00:26:02.995 region:rollup2
FIND OURSELVES AND.

00:26:01.593 --> 00:26:05.697 region:rollup2
WHEN I TALKED ABOUT ALREADY AND

00:26:02.995 --> 00:26:07.566 region:rollup2
THAT IS COMPLIANCE BLINDERS OR A

00:26:05.697 --> 00:26:08.801 region:rollup2
CULTURE OF COMPLIANCE.

00:26:07.566 --> 00:26:10.169 region:rollup2
BORROWING FROM ONE OF MY

00:26:08.801 --> 00:26:11.737 region:rollup2
FAVORITE COMEDIAN SETH MEYERS I

00:26:10.169 --> 00:26:13.906 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY THAT.

00:26:11.737 --> 00:26:15.307 region:rollup2
I LOVE WORKING FOR A CULTURE OF

00:26:13.906 --> 00:26:17.409 region:rollup2
OUR COMPANIES THAT VALUES

00:26:15.307 --> 00:26:19.645 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE WITH SAID BY NO

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:21.680 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE EVER.

00:26:19.645 --> 00:26:23.015 region:rollup2
SO THROUGH OUR EMPHASIS IN

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.117 region:rollup2
PROVIDING HARASSMENT FREE

00:26:23.015 --> 00:26:26.785 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE WE'VE MISSED THE MARK

00:26:25.117 --> 00:26:28.053 region:rollup2
AND FAILED TO FOCUS ON WHAT

00:26:26.785 --> 00:26:29.621 region:rollup2
REALLY MATTERS WHICH IS

00:26:28.053 --> 00:26:31.090 region:rollup2
PROVIDING A HEALTHY WORKPLACE

00:26:29.621 --> 00:26:32.524 region:rollup2
CULTURE.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.792 region:rollup2
ONE THING I FAILED TO MENTION IN

00:26:32.524 --> 00:26:35.894 region:rollup2
MY INTRODUCTION OF THAT I'M A

00:26:33.792 --> 00:26:37.696 region:rollup2
NATIVE OF EL SALVADOR. AND SO AS

00:26:35.894 --> 00:26:39.498 region:rollup2
A RESULT DE CHOSE WHICH OR

00:26:37.696 --> 00:26:41.066 region:rollup2
SAYINGS IN SPANISH ARE A BIG

00:26:39.498 --> 00:26:42.601 region:rollup2
PART OF MY CULTURE AND SO I COME

00:26:41.066 --> 00:26:44.169 region:rollup2
UP WITH A LOT OF SORT OF PITHY

00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:45.471 region:rollup2
SAYINGS. AND ONE OF THE ONE THAT

00:26:44.169 --> 00:26:48.807 region:rollup2
I COME UP FOR THIS CULTURE OF

00:26:45.471 --> 00:26:49.775 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE IS. IN PROMISING A

00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:51.543 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT FREE WORKPLACE.

00:26:49.775 --> 00:26:53.412 region:rollup2
IN MANY WAYS IS SIMILAR TO A

00:26:51.543 --> 00:26:54.947 region:rollup2
RESTAURANT SAYING WE PROMISE NOT

00:26:53.412 --> 00:26:56.682 region:rollup2
TO GIVE YOU FOOD POISONING.

00:26:54.947 --> 00:26:58.350 region:rollup2
SO WE'LL DO THE MINIMUM. BUT

00:26:56.682 --> 00:27:00.119 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALL WE'RE GONNA DO. NOT

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:01.220 region:rollup2
EXACTLY THE TYPE OF COMPANY THAT

00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:02.654 region:rollup2
YOU WANT TO WORK FOR ENTITY ONE

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:05.791 region:rollup2
OR FOURTH.

00:27:02.654 --> 00:27:07.392 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AND. ROUTE ISSUE IS NO

00:27:05.791 --> 00:27:08.594 region:rollup2
EARLY INTERVENTION.

00:27:07.392 --> 00:27:10.529 region:rollup2
BECAUSE TRAINING AND MANY

00:27:08.594 --> 00:27:12.431 region:rollup2
CORPORATE PRACTICES FOCUSED ON

00:27:10.529 --> 00:27:15.033 region:rollup2
THE PREVENTION AND RESOLUTION OF

00:27:12.431 --> 00:27:16.034 region:rollup2
UNLAWFUL. CONDUCT.

00:27:15.033 --> 00:27:17.703 region:rollup2
WE'VE DEVELOPED AN OVERALL

00:27:16.034 --> 00:27:19.838 region:rollup2
CULTURE THAT IGNORES PROBLEMS AT

00:27:17.703 --> 00:27:22.140 region:rollup2
AN EARLY STAGE WHEN PROBLEMS ARE

00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:23.141 region:rollup2
STILL FIXABLE.

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.943 region:rollup2
IN THE REGULATIONS THAT WE

00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:26.778 region:rollup2
DRAFTED FOR THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT

00:27:24.943 --> 00:27:29.481 region:rollup2
HOUSING COUNCIL SOMETHING I

00:27:26.778 --> 00:27:30.949 region:rollup2
INSISTED ON WAS REALLY ROOTED IN

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:32.384 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE LEGISLATIVE

00:27:30.949 --> 00:27:34.052 region:rollup2
HISTORY IN LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE.

00:27:32.384 --> 00:27:35.787 region:rollup2
OF AN EMPLOYER'S OBLIGATION TO

00:27:34.052 --> 00:27:37.623 region:rollup2
TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO PREVENT

00:27:35.787 --> 00:27:39.057 region:rollup2
INCORRECT HARASSMENT.

00:27:37.623 --> 00:27:41.159 region:rollup2
WHAT I INSIST ON WAS LANGUAGE

00:27:39.057 --> 00:27:42.661 region:rollup2
THAT TRACKED DOT STATUTORY ON

00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:44.096 region:rollup2
HISTORY?

00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:46.265 region:rollup2
AND SAID THAT EMPLOYERS OUR

00:27:44.096 --> 00:27:46.732 region:rollup2
OBLIGATED TO TAKE STEPS TO TAKE

00:27:46.265 --> 00:27:49.401 region:rollup2
ACTION AND TO CORRECT

00:27:46.732 --> 00:27:51.336 region:rollup2
MISCONDUCT.

00:27:49.401 --> 00:27:53.238 region:rollup2
NOT UNLAWFUL CONDUCT

00:27:51.336 --> 00:27:53.839 region:rollup2
IF YOU WAIT UNTIL IT'S UNLAWFUL

00:27:53.238 --> 00:27:56.708 region:rollup2
WE'VE WAITED TOO LONG AND IT'S

00:27:53.839 --> 00:27:58.710 region:rollup2
TOO LATE.

00:27:56.708 --> 00:28:01.513 region:rollup2
AND IN ADDITION TO THAT BEING

00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:03.549 region:rollup2
THE LAW IT'S GOOD BUSINESS.

00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:05.117 region:rollup2
A CULTURE OF COMPLICITY.

00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:06.351 region:rollup2
TRAINING A CORPORATE CULTURE

00:28:05.117 --> 00:28:09.021 region:rollup2
THAT TOLERATES BAD BEHAVIOR

00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:10.522 region:rollup2
SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK.

00:28:09.021 --> 00:28:12.090 region:rollup2
AN IMBALANCE IN POWER AS I

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:13.692 region:rollup2
MENTIONED EARLIER.

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:15.594 region:rollup2
IS A HALLMARK OF MOORE'S MOST

00:28:13.692 --> 00:28:16.962 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT CLAIMS AND WE'VE SEEN

00:28:15.594 --> 00:28:18.463 region:rollup2
THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN DURING

00:28:16.962 --> 00:28:19.231 region:rollup2
THE ME TO MOVEMENT.

00:28:18.463 --> 00:28:20.832 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT THERE IS AN

00:28:19.231 --> 00:28:22.267 region:rollup2
IMBALANCE IN POWER IS THE ROOT

00:28:20.832 --> 00:28:24.203 region:rollup2
CAUSE OF MANY OF THE WOMEN WHO

00:28:22.267 --> 00:28:25.704 region:rollup2
HAVE COME FORWARD.

00:28:24.203 --> 00:28:27.506 region:rollup2
THIS IS SEEN IN ISSUES RELATED

00:28:25.704 --> 00:28:28.707 region:rollup2
TO PAY INEQUITY.

00:28:27.506 --> 00:28:29.608 region:rollup2
AS WELL AS A SMALL NUMBER OF

00:28:28.707 --> 00:28:31.009 region:rollup2
WOMEN IN KEY LEADERSHIP

00:28:29.608 --> 00:28:32.945 region:rollup2
POSITIONS.

00:28:31.009 --> 00:28:33.845 region:rollup2
SO COMBINING AN IMBALANCE OF

00:28:32.945 --> 00:28:36.148 region:rollup2
POWER WITH THE CULTURE OF

00:28:33.845 --> 00:28:38.116 region:rollup2
COMPLICITY. MEANS THAT TARGETS

00:28:36.148 --> 00:28:40.285 region:rollup2
OF BAD BEHAVIOR ARE DOUBLE

00:28:38.116 --> 00:28:41.920 region:rollup2
VICTIMIZED FIRST BY THE

00:28:40.285 --> 00:28:43.622 region:rollup2
PERPETRATOR. AND THEN BY AN

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:45.757 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION THAT TURNS THE

00:28:43.622 --> 00:28:47.492 region:rollup2
OTHER WAY AND FAILED TO ADDRESS

00:28:45.757 --> 00:28:48.860 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES EARLY.

00:28:47.492 --> 00:28:50.862 region:rollup2
THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN THE

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.497 region:rollup2
PERPETRATOR IS SEEN AS A HIGH

00:28:50.862 --> 00:28:55.234 region:rollup2
VALUE EMPLOYEE WHO SIMPLY CANNOT

00:28:52.497 --> 00:28:57.202 region:rollup2
BE LOST.

00:28:55.234 --> 00:28:59.004 region:rollup2
THEN ANOTHER ISSUE IS A FAILURE

00:28:57.202 --> 00:29:00.439 region:rollup2
TO REPORT.

00:28:59.004 --> 00:29:02.040 region:rollup2
SO STUDIES INDICATE THAT

00:29:00.439 --> 00:29:03.208 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY FIVE AND

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.610 region:rollup2
SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF WOMEN

00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:06.545 region:rollup2
WHO WERE SURVEYED SAY THAT

00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:07.079 region:rollup2
THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO SOME

00:29:06.545 --> 00:29:08.180 region:rollup2
TYPE OF SEXUALLY HARASSING

00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:10.315 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR.

00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:11.917 region:rollup2
WHY THE DISPARITY IT DEPENDS ON

00:29:10.315 --> 00:29:13.919 region:rollup2
HOW THE QUESTION OF IS ASKED IF

00:29:11.917 --> 00:29:15.721 region:rollup2
THE QUESTION IS SIMPLY HAVE YOU

00:29:13.919 --> 00:29:16.989 region:rollup2
BEEN SEXUALLY HARASSED? THEN WE

00:29:15.721 --> 00:29:18.323 region:rollup2
TEND TO SEE NUMBERS IN THE LOWER

00:29:16.989 --> 00:29:19.291 region:rollup2
RANGE.

00:29:18.323 --> 00:29:20.525 region:rollup2
IF ON THE OTHER HAND THE

00:29:19.291 --> 00:29:22.060 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS VERY SPECIFIC HAVE

00:29:20.525 --> 00:29:23.462 region:rollup2
YOU BEEN EXPOSED TO THIS TYPE OF

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:25.364 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR.

00:29:23.462 --> 00:29:27.466 region:rollup2
THEN THE NUMBER SHOOT UP.

00:29:25.364 --> 00:29:28.900 region:rollup2
THE LESSON IS CLEAR THAT IT IS

00:29:27.466 --> 00:29:30.769 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT UNFORTUNATELY

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:32.371 region:rollup2
DOES STILL HAPPEN IN THE

00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:33.772 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE VERY OFTEN.

00:29:32.371 --> 00:29:35.674 region:rollup2
NOW GIVEN A NUMBER OF INTERNAL

00:29:33.772 --> 00:29:36.975 region:rollup2
REPORTS AND LAWSUITS.

00:29:35.674 --> 00:29:38.143 region:rollup2
THIS MEANS THAT THE VAST

00:29:36.975 --> 00:29:39.444 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF INSTANCES OF

00:29:38.143 --> 00:29:41.480 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR ARE NEVER

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:42.447 region:rollup2
REPORTED.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.815 region:rollup2
EVEN ASSUMING THAT A FAIR

00:29:42.447 --> 00:29:45.284 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE OF THOSE EXAMPLES OF

00:29:43.815 --> 00:29:47.886 region:rollup2
BAD BEHAVIOR ARE RESOLVED IN

00:29:45.284 --> 00:29:49.321 region:rollup2
SOME WAY. IT STILL LEAVES A HIGH

00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:51.356 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF CONCERNS UNADDRESSED

00:29:49.321 --> 00:29:51.857 region:rollup2
AND INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD

00:29:51.356 --> 00:29:52.891 region:rollup2
THAT THAT BEHAVIOR WILL

00:29:51.857 --> 00:29:53.859 region:rollup2
ESCALATE.

00:29:52.891 --> 00:29:55.761 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY IN A CULTURE OF

00:29:53.859 --> 00:29:57.963 region:rollup2
COMPLICITY WORD THE MESSAGE SENT

00:29:55.761 --> 00:29:59.898 region:rollup2
IS NOT ONLY TO ACCEPT YOUR

00:29:57.963 --> 00:30:01.133 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR WE ENCOURAGE IT.

00:29:59.898 --> 00:30:03.635 region:rollup2
THE OTHER REASONS FOR FAILING TO

00:30:01.133 --> 00:30:06.705 region:rollup2
REPORT INCLUDE FEAR RETALIATION.

00:30:03.635 --> 00:30:08.206 region:rollup2
A FEELING OF OF FUTILITY. OF

00:30:06.705 --> 00:30:09.975 region:rollup2
FEAR OF BEING LABELLED AS A

00:30:08.206 --> 00:30:12.411 region:rollup2
TROUBLEMAKER.

00:30:09.975 --> 00:30:14.680 region:rollup2
OR FRANKLY JUST NOT KNOWING HOW

00:30:12.411 --> 00:30:15.914 region:rollup2
TO DO IT.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.948 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CORPORATE DISCONNECT

00:30:15.914 --> 00:30:18.917 region:rollup2
AS WELL THAT I THINK IS

00:30:16.948 --> 00:30:20.152 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO TALK ABOUT.

00:30:18.917 --> 00:30:21.186 region:rollup2
WE HAD AND TRAIN RECENTLY

00:30:20.152 --> 00:30:22.621 region:rollup2
PERFORMED A SURVEY WE'RE IN THE

00:30:21.186 --> 00:30:24.456 region:rollup2
PROCESS OF WRITING A WHITE PAPER

00:30:22.621 --> 00:30:26.792 region:rollup2
ABOUT IT. AND ONE OF THE THE

00:30:24.456 --> 00:30:28.360 region:rollup2
REALLY STARK FINDINGS FOR ME WAS

00:30:26.792 --> 00:30:30.095 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE PRELIMINARY QUESTIONS

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:33.865 region:rollup2
THAT WE ASK GENERAL COUNSEL AT

00:30:30.095 --> 00:30:35.701 region:rollup2
CORPORATIONS WAS HOW. OFTEN DO

00:30:33.865 --> 00:30:36.234 region:rollup2
YOU THINK SEXUAL HARASSMENT

00:30:35.701 --> 00:30:37.469 region:rollup2
OCCURS IN YOUR PARTICULAR

00:30:36.234 --> 00:30:38.837 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

00:30:37.469 --> 00:30:40.305 region:rollup2
AND OVER FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR

00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:42.107 region:rollup2
RESPONDENTS SAYS IT NEVER

00:30:40.305 --> 00:30:44.109 region:rollup2
HAPPENS OR IT RARELY HAPPENS.

00:30:42.107 --> 00:30:45.277 region:rollup2
IT SOUNDS GOOD.

00:30:44.109 --> 00:30:46.945 region:rollup2
UNTIL YOU GET TO ABOUT TEN

00:30:45.277 --> 00:30:48.780 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS AFTER THAT.

00:30:46.945 --> 00:30:51.083 region:rollup2
AND THE QUESTION WAS.

00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:52.684 region:rollup2
ON A SCALE OF VERY COMFORTABLE

00:30:51.083 --> 00:30:54.386 region:rollup2
TO NOT COMFORTABLE AT ALL.

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:55.754 region:rollup2
WHERE WOULD YOU RATE THE COMFORT

00:30:54.386 --> 00:30:57.989 region:rollup2
LEVEL THAT YOUR EMPLOYEES HAVE

00:30:55.754 --> 00:30:59.624 region:rollup2
REPORTING? BAD BEHAVIOR IN THE

00:30:57.989 --> 00:31:01.360 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

00:30:59.624 --> 00:31:02.327 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE PERCENT SAID THAT

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.862 region:rollup2
THEIR EMPLOYEES WERE VERY

00:31:02.327 --> 00:31:06.164 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE ARE COMFORTABLE.

00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:07.499 region:rollup2
THAT'S A DISCONNECT.

00:31:06.164 --> 00:31:08.800 region:rollup2
YOU ALL KNOW THAT HARASSMENT IS

00:31:07.499 --> 00:31:10.335 region:rollup2
OCCURRING BECAUSE NO ONE'S

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.737 region:rollup2
TELLING YOU ABOUT IT AND THE

00:31:10.335 --> 00:31:13.805 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS WHY AREN'T THEY

00:31:11.737 --> 00:31:15.674 region:rollup2
TELLING YOU ABOUT IT.

00:31:13.805 --> 00:31:18.443 region:rollup2
THESE STATISTICS SUPPLY.

00:31:15.674 --> 00:31:20.679 region:rollup2
A PRIVATE PUBLIC FOR PROFIT NOT

00:31:18.443 --> 00:31:22.180 region:rollup2
FOR PROFIT. UNIONIZED AND NON

00:31:20.679 --> 00:31:23.882 region:rollup2
UNIONIZED PLACES ALIKE WORK

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:26.385 region:rollup2
PLACES LIKE.

00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:27.886 region:rollup2
SO.

00:31:26.385 --> 00:31:29.187 region:rollup2
WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE WHAT

00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:31.256 region:rollup2
DOES WORK WHAT DOES EXPERIENCE

00:31:29.187 --> 00:31:31.857 region:rollup2
SHOW US?

00:31:31.256 --> 00:31:33.425 region:rollup2
NOW THAT WE KNOW THE CURRENT

00:31:31.857 --> 00:31:34.893 region:rollup2
STATE OF AFFAIRS LET'S TURN OUR

00:31:33.425 --> 00:31:36.228 region:rollup2
ATTENTION TO WHY WE'RE HERE TO

00:31:34.893 --> 00:31:37.462 region:rollup2
FIND SOLUTIONS.

00:31:36.228 --> 00:31:39.297 region:rollup2
AND SOLUTIONS THAT WILL NOT ONLY

00:31:37.462 --> 00:31:41.366 region:rollup2
BE EFFECTIVE BUT SOLUTIONS THAT

00:31:39.297 --> 00:31:42.534 region:rollup2
ARE DOABLE.

00:31:41.366 --> 00:31:44.369 region:rollup2
SO HERE ARE SOME OF THE

00:31:42.534 --> 00:31:45.871 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I HAVE.

00:31:44.369 --> 00:31:47.839 region:rollup2
THE FIRST IS OBVIOUSLY WE'VE

00:31:45.871 --> 00:31:49.141 region:rollup2
BEEN FOCUSING ON TODAY AND I

00:31:47.839 --> 00:31:51.276 region:rollup2
THINK WHAT THE COMMITTEE HAS

00:31:49.141 --> 00:31:51.843 region:rollup2
BEEN FOCUSING ON WRIT LARGE

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:52.811 region:rollup2
SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS

00:31:51.843 --> 00:31:54.813 region:rollup2
WORK.

00:31:52.811 --> 00:31:56.248 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS FOSTERING A POSITIVE

00:31:54.813 --> 00:31:58.049 region:rollup2
RESPECTFUL AND INCLUSIVE

00:31:56.248 --> 00:31:59.451 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE CULTURE.

00:31:58.049 --> 00:32:01.987 region:rollup2
WE HAVE BEEN TREATING THE

00:31:59.451 --> 00:32:03.221 region:rollup2
SYMPTOMS AND NOT THE DISEASE AND

00:32:01.987 --> 00:32:04.990 region:rollup2
THAT'S A REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT

00:32:03.221 --> 00:32:05.857 region:rollup2
PART OF THIS.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:07.325 region:rollup2
YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:32:05.857 --> 00:32:08.794 region:rollup2
WHATEVER Q. WORK YOU IMPLEMENT

00:32:07.325 --> 00:32:10.328 region:rollup2
FOR ALL WE KNOW IS A DISEASE

00:32:08.794 --> 00:32:12.197 region:rollup2
WHICH IS SEXUAL HARASSMENT.

00:32:10.328 --> 00:32:14.266 region:rollup2
THAT IS ACTUALLY IN LINE WITH

00:32:12.197 --> 00:32:15.667 region:rollup2
OTHER PIECES OF THE PUZZLE.

00:32:14.266 --> 00:32:17.836 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE DEAR POLICIES AND

00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:20.806 region:rollup2
PRACTICES FOCUS SOLELY ON LEGAL

00:32:17.836 --> 00:32:23.241 region:rollup2
ISSUES. I HAD THE HONOR OF

00:32:20.806 --> 00:32:24.810 region:rollup2
RECENTLY REVIEWING I AM AND HAVE

00:32:23.241 --> 00:32:26.344 region:rollup2
FRIENDS WITH KEVIN KISHI WAS A

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:28.447 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR OF THE DFP AGE. AND HE

00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:31.116 region:rollup2
SENT TO ME WHAT THE UP PROPOSED

00:32:28.447 --> 00:32:31.750 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE IS FOR A MODEL POLICY.

00:32:31.116 --> 00:32:33.552 region:rollup2
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'M

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:34.719 region:rollup2
DISCUSSING WITH HIM ESPECIALLY

00:32:33.552 --> 00:32:36.354 region:rollup2
IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:37.355 region:rollup2
THE CUTTING EDGE STATE THAT

00:32:36.354 --> 00:32:39.758 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY LOOKS TO AS A AS AN

00:32:37.355 --> 00:32:41.493 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT

00:32:39.758 --> 00:32:43.094 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT ONLY PROMISING THAT

00:32:41.493 --> 00:32:44.629 region:rollup2
WILL DO SOMETHING OF BEHAVIOR

00:32:43.094 --> 00:32:46.798 region:rollup2
THAT IS ILLEGAL IS SOMEHOW

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:48.266 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED. TO REALLY BE CUTTING

00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:49.534 region:rollup2
EDGE AND TALK IN OUR POLICIES

00:32:48.266 --> 00:32:51.837 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO

00:32:49.534 --> 00:32:52.671 region:rollup2
BEYOND THAT WHAT EMPLOYEES READ

00:32:51.837 --> 00:32:54.206 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY READ A POLICY THAT

00:32:52.671 --> 00:32:55.707 region:rollup2
SAYS. WE DON'T TOLERATE

00:32:54.206 --> 00:32:58.410 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT THAT IS BASED ON A

00:32:55.707 --> 00:33:00.011 region:rollup2
PROTECTED CATEGORY IS BECAUSE OF

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:01.813 region:rollup2
ITS NOT BASED ON A PROTECTED

00:33:00.011 --> 00:33:02.681 region:rollup2
CATEGORY. BUT IT'S FOR A GAME

00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:04.382 region:rollup2
AND WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE

00:33:02.681 --> 00:33:06.351 region:rollup2
THAT WHATEVER WE DO IN TERMS OF

00:33:04.382 --> 00:33:08.787 region:rollup2
POLICIES AND PRACTICES. FALLS IN

00:33:06.351 --> 00:33:09.387 region:rollup2
LINE WITH SOME OF THE BIG

00:33:08.787 --> 00:33:09.955 region:rollup2
PICTURE IS THAT WE'RE TALKING

00:33:09.387 --> 00:33:12.123 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

00:33:09.955 --> 00:33:13.592 region:rollup2
EMBRACING A CULTURE OF TRUTH

00:33:12.123 --> 00:33:15.260 region:rollup2
TELLING THIS TO ME IS A VERY

00:33:13.592 --> 00:33:17.162 region:rollup2
VERY KEY.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.730 region:rollup2
IN A WORKPLACE THAT IT EMBRACES

00:33:17.162 --> 00:33:20.065 region:rollup2
THE IDEA OF BEING HEALTHY

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:22.501 region:rollup2
RESPECTFUL INCLUSIVE AND

00:33:20.065 --> 00:33:24.002 region:rollup2
PRODUCTIVE. REPORTS OF POSSIBLE

00:33:22.501 --> 00:33:25.203 region:rollup2
MISCONDUCT SHOULD BE WELCOMED

00:33:24.002 --> 00:33:26.137 region:rollup2
AND SHOULD BE SEEN AS AN

00:33:25.203 --> 00:33:27.873 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE

00:33:26.137 --> 00:33:29.274 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

00:33:27.873 --> 00:33:30.408 region:rollup2
FAILURE TO WELCOME COMPLAINTS

00:33:29.274 --> 00:33:32.577 region:rollup2
AND FAILURE TO ADDRESS THESE

00:33:30.408 --> 00:33:34.880 region:rollup2
CONCERNS DOES NOT MAKE THE

00:33:32.577 --> 00:33:36.615 region:rollup2
ISSUES GO AWAY IT SIMPLY ROBS US

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.550 region:rollup2
OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS

00:33:36.615 --> 00:33:39.684 region:rollup2
THEM AND TO FIX THEM.

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:41.286 region:rollup2
AND ONE THING THAT IS

00:33:39.684 --> 00:33:44.256 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY TRUE IN TRAINING IS

00:33:41.286 --> 00:33:45.557 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS A FALLACY THAT

00:33:44.256 --> 00:33:47.359 region:rollup2
GOOD TRAINING SHOULD MEAN LESS

00:33:45.557 --> 00:33:49.361 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS.

00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:50.629 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT ALWAYS TRUE SOMETIMES

00:33:49.361 --> 00:33:52.497 region:rollup2
GOOD TRAINING MEANS THAT PEOPLE

00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:53.398 region:rollup2
ARE COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO COME

00:33:52.497 --> 00:33:54.866 region:rollup2
FORWARD AND ACTUALLY LODGE

00:33:53.398 --> 00:33:56.401 region:rollup2
CONCERNS AND ESPECIALLY IF

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:57.569 region:rollup2
THEY'RE COMFORTABLE DOING SO. AT

00:33:56.401 --> 00:33:59.938 region:rollup2
THE EARLY STAGE FOR SOMETHING

00:33:57.569 --> 00:34:01.273 region:rollup2
CAN BE DONE.

00:33:59.938 --> 00:34:02.741 region:rollup2
ANOTHER ISSUE IS TEACHING A NEW

00:34:01.273 --> 00:34:03.942 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE AND PROVIDING TOOLS TO

00:34:02.741 --> 00:34:05.610 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATE PRECISELY AND

00:34:03.942 --> 00:34:07.078 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY.

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:08.713 region:rollup2
NOT DEFENSIVELY AND IN A

00:34:07.078 --> 00:34:10.415 region:rollup2
CONFRONTATIONAL WAY.

00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:12.984 region:rollup2
WHEN WE ONLY TEACHER EMPLOYEES

00:34:10.415 --> 00:34:14.252 region:rollup2
AND MANAGERS LEGAL LANGUAGE IT'S

00:34:12.984 --> 00:34:15.320 region:rollup2
REASONABLE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

00:34:14.252 --> 00:34:17.289 region:rollup2
THE TOOLS AND LANGUAGE NECESSARY

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:19.190 region:rollup2
TO REPORT BEHAVIOR. AT THE POINT

00:34:17.289 --> 00:34:21.860 region:rollup2
WHERE IT CAN BE RESOLVED AS AN

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:23.295 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE RELATIONS ISSUE. RATHER

00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:26.498 region:rollup2
THAN IN THE PUBLIC RELATIONS

00:34:23.295 --> 00:34:27.799 region:rollup2
SPHERE OR AS A LEGAL ISSUE.

00:34:26.498 --> 00:34:29.401 region:rollup2
AND FINISHING IT OFF A COUPLE OF

00:34:27.799 --> 00:34:31.036 region:rollup2
OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS MICRO

00:34:29.401 --> 00:34:32.704 region:rollup2
LEARNING MANY LESSONS GUIDE

00:34:31.036 --> 00:34:34.005 region:rollup2
SUMMARIES SCRIPTS.

00:34:32.704 --> 00:34:35.740 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO SUPPLEMENT FORMAL

00:34:34.005 --> 00:34:37.175 region:rollup2
LEARNING SESSIONS WITH BURSTS OF

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:39.077 region:rollup2
LEARNING TO REINFORCE WHAT IS

00:34:37.175 --> 00:34:39.878 region:rollup2
TAUGHT IN FORMAL TRAINING.

00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:41.046 region:rollup2
THE TRAINING NEEDS TO BE

00:34:39.878 --> 00:34:42.781 region:rollup2
PERSONALIZED ALLOWING FOR

00:34:41.046 --> 00:34:44.082 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED.

00:34:42.781 --> 00:34:45.750 region:rollup2
AND FOR PROVIDING ACCURATE

00:34:44.082 --> 00:34:47.686 region:rollup2
PRACTICAL AND REAL WORLD ANSWER

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:48.753 region:rollup2
TO THOSE QUESTIONS.

00:34:47.686 --> 00:34:50.555 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO TAKE A PROGRAMMATIC

00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:52.924 region:rollup2
APPROACH SO FOR EMPLOYEES AND

00:34:50.555 --> 00:34:53.959 region:rollup2
MANAGERS. AND IN THE CONTEXT OF

00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:55.760 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD

00:34:53.959 --> 00:34:57.362 region:rollup2
INCLUDE LEGISLATORS CHIEFS OF

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:58.363 region:rollup2
STAFF AND OTHER STAFFERS.

00:34:57.362 --> 00:34:59.664 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD BE TRADE AT THE VERY

00:34:58.363 --> 00:35:02.033 region:rollup2
LEAST SOME WHAT I CALL THE FIVE

00:34:59.664 --> 00:35:04.035 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALS HARASSMENT PREVENTION

00:35:02.033 --> 00:35:06.204 region:rollup2
IMPLICIT OR UNCONSCIOUS BIAS.

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:07.372 region:rollup2
DIVERSITY INCLUSION BELONGING

00:35:06.204 --> 00:35:09.274 region:rollup2
CONFLICT RESOLUTION AND

00:35:07.372 --> 00:35:11.242 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION SKILLS.

00:35:09.274 --> 00:35:11.843 region:rollup2
FREE CHARTER WOULD ADD ONE MORE

00:35:11.242 --> 00:35:13.144 region:rollup2
AND THIS WOULD BE IN THE RULES

00:35:11.843 --> 00:35:14.980 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE.

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:15.947 region:rollup2
WITHIN THEIR PURVIEW AND THAT IS

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.748 region:rollup2
TRAINING ON HOW TO RECEIVE

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:18.216 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE AND RESOLVE

00:35:16.748 --> 00:35:19.484 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS.

00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:21.920 region:rollup2
THE SURVEY THAT ARE REFERENCED

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:23.054 region:rollup2
EARLIER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT LESS

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:24.255 region:rollup2
THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF

00:35:23.054 --> 00:35:26.157 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATORS.

00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:28.193 region:rollup2
AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THESE.

00:35:26.157 --> 00:35:29.694 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SURVEYED. ARE ACTUALLY

00:35:28.193 --> 00:35:32.464 region:rollup2
WELL TRAINED IN HOW TO

00:35:29.694 --> 00:35:35.133 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS.

00:35:32.464 --> 00:35:37.369 region:rollup2
SO. THE BUDDHIST TEACHER SYLVIA

00:35:35.133 --> 00:35:39.104 region:rollup2
BORNSTEIN SAID WHEN WE SEE

00:35:37.369 --> 00:35:39.671 region:rollup2
CLEARLY WE BEHAVED IMPECCABLY.

00:35:39.104 --> 00:35:41.373 region:rollup2
THAT IN MY VIEW THE TASK AT

00:35:39.671 --> 00:35:43.575 region:rollup2
HAND.

00:35:41.373 --> 00:35:45.010 region:rollup2
IT'S TO CHANGE ISN'T TO CHANGE

00:35:43.575 --> 00:35:46.378 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR BUT RATHER TO THINK

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:48.913 region:rollup2
CLEARLY.

00:35:46.378 --> 00:35:50.382 region:rollup2
AND AS A BY PRODUCT.

00:35:48.913 --> 00:35:51.883 region:rollup2
BURNING BEHIND WILL BE HERE.

00:35:50.382 --> 00:35:54.085 region:rollup2
AND AS A BY PRODUCT OF THAT

00:35:51.883 --> 00:35:54.853 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING.

00:35:54.085 --> 00:35:57.155 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY WILL SEE BEHAVIOR

00:35:54.853 --> 00:35:57.956 region:rollup2
CHANGE.

00:35:57.155 --> 00:36:01.993 region:rollup2
SO THE FINAL THING THAT I

00:35:57.956 --> 00:36:03.094 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND.

00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:04.963 region:rollup2
IS THE COLLECTION AND USE OF

00:36:03.094 --> 00:36:06.331 region:rollup2
DATA.

00:36:04.963 --> 00:36:08.199 region:rollup2
I DEAL TRAINING WILL INCLUDE A

00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:08.833 region:rollup2
WAY TO TRACK ISSUES RELATED TO

00:36:08.199 --> 00:36:11.102 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE.

00:36:08.833 --> 00:36:12.370 region:rollup2
SUBJECT MATTERS THAT CAN BE

00:36:11.102 --> 00:36:13.938 region:rollup2
ANALYZED AND USED TO CREATE A

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:15.240 region:rollup2
POSITIVE CYCLE OF REPORTING

00:36:13.938 --> 00:36:17.175 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATING AND RESOLVING

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.610 region:rollup2
ISSUES EARLY.

00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:20.712 region:rollup2
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR GIVING ME

00:36:18.610 --> 00:36:21.780 region:rollup2
THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE.

00:36:20.712 --> 00:36:24.916 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ON THIS TIMELY AND

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:27.085 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TOPIC.

SOME QUESTIONS THAT ARE MOVED TO

00:36:29.521 --> 00:36:33.024 region:rollup2
THE SUBCOMMITTEE.

00:36:30.155 --> 00:36:34.759 region:rollup2

00:36:37.429 --> 00:36:39.631 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH IN LINE WITH WHAT

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:41.466 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM OTHERS

00:36:39.631 --> 00:36:42.934 region:rollup2
SPEAKERS ABOUT. OF THE

00:36:41.466 --> 00:36:44.803 region:rollup2
IMPORTANCE OF CULTURE CHANGE.

AND WORKING ON THOSE UNDERLYING

00:36:44.803 --> 00:36:48.640 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT MAKE I'M. MAKE FOR

00:36:47.505 --> 00:36:50.208 region:rollup2
AN UNPLEASANT WORKPLACE ANNA AND

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:52.077 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE IT'S NOT PROTECTIVE OF

00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:53.411 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES OR THAT VALUES OF

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:02.320 region:rollup2
HAS TALKED ABOUT AND OTHERS IS

00:37:00.218 --> 00:37:04.689 region:rollup2
FINDING A WAY TO REINFORCE GOOD

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.024 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOUR. BY HAVING WAY BY

00:37:04.689 --> 00:37:07.125 region:rollup2
MAKING IT CLEAR THAT WE ARE

00:37:06.024 --> 00:37:08.460 region:rollup2

SUPERVISORS TO.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:12.497 region:rollup2
EMBODIED THE TYPE OF.

00:37:10.462 --> 00:37:14.165 region:rollup2
THE BEHAVIOR WE WANTED ALSO CAN

00:37:12.497 --> 00:37:15.867 region:rollup2
CREATE THE ATMOSPHERE THAT WE'RE

00:37:14.165 --> 00:37:17.335 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR IN THE VALUES THAT

00:37:15.867 --> 00:37:18.636 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO BRING TORN PLEASE SO.

YOU CAN FORMALIZE AND ENCOURAGE

00:37:21.272 --> 00:37:26.311 region:rollup2
THE PROMOTION OF MANAGERS AND

00:37:23.475 --> 00:37:27.445 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS. THAT DO CREATE THE

00:37:26.311 --> 00:37:29.481 region:rollup2
TYPE OF WORKPLACE THAT WOULD

00:37:27.445 --> 00:37:31.249 region:rollup2
LIKE TO SEE HOW DO YOU KIND OF

00:37:29.481 --> 00:37:31.850 region:rollup2
WRITE THAT INTO YOUR POLICIES

00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:35.353 region:rollup2
ARE MAKE THAT SOMETHING THAT'S

00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:36.688 region:rollup2
DONE.

00:37:35.353 --> 00:37:38.223 region:rollup2
YOU BOTH KNOW THAT YOU'RE GONNA

00:37:36.688 --> 00:37:40.091 region:rollup2
GET IT OUT OF THE TO GO KEEPING

00:37:38.223 --> 00:37:42.427 region:rollup2
IN MIND THAT WE TEND TO REWARD.

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:44.028 region:rollup2
SORT OF TYPE A BEHAVIOR ARE YOU

00:37:42.427 --> 00:37:45.263 region:rollup2
KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO YOU

00:37:44.028 --> 00:37:46.731 region:rollup2
KNOW ARE KIND OF GOOD AT GETTING

00:37:45.263 --> 00:37:48.366 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THROUGH WORK KNOW

00:37:46.731 --> 00:37:49.767 region:rollup2
ABOUT PARTICULAR ISSUES THAT

00:37:48.366 --> 00:37:51.202 region:rollup2
THAT BECOMES A THING HERE

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:52.137 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THAT SCENE IS THE MOST

00:37:51.202 --> 00:37:54.506 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

00:37:52.137 --> 00:37:56.040 region:rollup2
QUALITY TO HAVE AN END THAT'S

00:37:54.506 --> 00:37:57.809 region:rollup2
NOT UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES

00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:58.910 region:rollup2
UNCERTAINLY AS A LAWYER I I SEE

00:37:57.809 --> 00:38:01.412 region:rollup2
THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE WERE VERY

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:03.381 region:rollup2
GOOD AT. A UNDERSTAND THE LAW.

00:38:01.412 --> 00:38:05.216 region:rollup2
AND AND LITIGATING CASES I'M

00:38:03.381 --> 00:38:05.950 region:rollup2
ALSO GET PROMOTED IN OTHER

00:38:05.216 --> 00:38:06.618 region:rollup2
ARENAS

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:08.052 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WERE TECHNICALLY GOOD AT

00:38:06.618 --> 00:38:09.721 region:rollup2
THEIR JOBS GET PROMOTED WITHOUT

00:38:08.052 --> 00:38:12.123 region:rollup2
REALLY PAYING ATTENTION TO THIS.

00:38:09.721 --> 00:38:13.191 region:rollup2
PART OF THE SKILL SET SO TO

00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:13.691 region:rollup2
TOOL THAT I THINK ARE REALLY

00:38:13.191 --> 00:38:15.894 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND ARE UNDER

00:38:13.691 --> 00:38:18.496 region:rollup2
UTILIZED.

00:38:15.894 --> 00:38:19.731 region:rollup2
ONE IS A PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

00:38:18.496 --> 00:38:21.132 region:rollup2
SYSTEM AND THERE'S CERTAINLY A

00:38:19.731 --> 00:38:22.367 region:rollup2
LOT OF DEBATE WITHIN THE CHURCH

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:24.002 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY WHETHER. THAT

00:38:22.367 --> 00:38:24.769 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO BE AN ANNUAL REVIEW

00:38:24.002 --> 00:38:26.171 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:38:24.769 --> 00:38:27.539 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE DONE MORE OFTEN I FALL

00:38:26.171 --> 00:38:28.673 region:rollup2
ON THE SIDE OF IT SHOULD BE DONE

00:38:27.539 --> 00:38:30.775 region:rollup2
MORE OFTEN THAN THAT.

00:38:28.673 --> 00:38:34.179 region:rollup2
BUT IN WHATEVER MANNER THAT YOU

00:38:30.775 --> 00:38:35.380 region:rollup2
DO IT HAVING VERY MEASURABLE AND

00:38:34.179 --> 00:38:38.516 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:40.185 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS BOTH OF BACKWARDS

00:38:38.516 --> 00:38:41.986 region:rollup2
LOOKING FORWARD LOOKING MEANING.

00:38:40.185 --> 00:38:43.054 region:rollup2
AT YOU KNOW AT THE OUTSET IS A

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:44.189 region:rollup2
BASELINE YOU SAY HERE'S WHAT I

00:38:43.054 --> 00:38:45.423 region:rollup2
EXPECT FROM YOU OF COURSE I

00:38:44.189 --> 00:38:47.091 region:rollup2
EXPECT TO BE TECHNICALLY

00:38:45.423 --> 00:38:48.793 region:rollup2
PROFICIENT IN YOUR JOB. BUT IF

00:38:47.091 --> 00:38:50.094 region:rollup2
YOU ARE LOOKING TO BE IN A

00:38:48.793 --> 00:38:51.896 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT POSITION AND ACTUALLY

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:53.031 region:rollup2
OVERSEEING PEOPLE THAN THAT PART

00:38:51.896 --> 00:38:54.699 region:rollup2
OF IT IS ALSO GOING TO BE

00:38:53.031 --> 00:38:55.066 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND HERE'S WHAT WE

00:38:54.699 --> 00:38:56.634 region:rollup2
EXPECT.

00:38:55.066 --> 00:38:58.102 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:59.337 region:rollup2
BACKWARD LOOKING IS ONCE YOU'VE

00:38:58.102 --> 00:39:00.438 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED THAT EXPECTATION

00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:02.240 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE MEETING

00:39:00.438 --> 00:39:02.974 region:rollup2
THAT. SO USING THE PERFORMANCE

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.475 region:rollup2
EVALUATION.

00:39:02.974 --> 00:39:05.610 region:rollup2
OR PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

00:39:04.475 --> 00:39:07.478 region:rollup2
SYSTEM I THINK IS ONE REALLY

00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:08.646 region:rollup2
UNDER UTILIZED TOOL THE OTHER

00:39:07.478 --> 00:39:10.215 region:rollup2
UNDER UTILIZED TOOL WOULD BE

00:39:08.646 --> 00:39:11.850 region:rollup2
JUST THE JOB DESCRIPTION WHICH

00:39:10.215 --> 00:39:13.117 region:rollup2
GOES HAND IN HAND WITH THAT. AND

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:15.086 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT THOSE

00:39:13.117 --> 00:39:17.689 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS ARE MADE.

00:39:15.086 --> 00:39:19.858 region:rollup2
EXCEEDINGLY CLEAR TO THE PEOPLE

00:39:17.689 --> 00:39:21.860 region:rollup2
WHO ARE SEEKING THOSE POSITIONS.

00:39:19.858 --> 00:39:24.295 region:rollup2
AND FRANKLY THAT DAD THOSE

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:25.163 region:rollup2
TOOLS ARE THEN USED TO EITHER.

00:39:24.295 --> 00:39:26.664 region:rollup2
.

00:39:25.163 --> 00:39:28.433 region:rollup2
AND.

00:39:26.664 --> 00:39:29.601 region:rollup2
ASSIST IN THE PROMOTION IN OTHER

00:39:28.433 --> 00:39:30.969 region:rollup2
WORDS YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE DOING A

00:39:29.601 --> 00:39:32.003 region:rollup2
GOOD JOB YOU GET REWARDED AS A

00:39:30.969 --> 00:39:33.204 region:rollup2
RESULT OF MEETING THOSE

00:39:32.003 --> 00:39:34.973 region:rollup2
EXPECTATIONS.

00:39:33.204 --> 00:39:36.140 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:39:34.973 --> 00:39:37.876 region:rollup2
IF IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE AN

00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:38.443 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT PART OF JOB JOB

00:39:37.876 --> 00:39:40.345 region:rollup2
DESCRIPTION AND PERFORMANCE

00:39:38.443 --> 00:39:41.646 region:rollup2
MANAGEMENT THEN YOU ALSO GET

00:39:40.345 --> 00:39:42.480 region:rollup2
DIDN'T FRANKLY IF YOU'RE NOT

00:39:41.646 --> 00:39:44.148 region:rollup2
DOING THAT.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.416 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S KIND OF THE IDEA OF

00:39:44.148 --> 00:39:47.619 region:rollup2
THE HIGH VALUE EMPLOYEE THAT I

00:39:45.416 --> 00:39:49.387 region:rollup2
TALKED ABOUT IS THAT TOO OFTEN

00:39:47.619 --> 00:39:50.755 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WILL OVERLOOK.

00:39:49.387 --> 00:39:52.290 region:rollup2
DEFICIENCIES WHEN IT COMES TO

00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:53.524 region:rollup2
PEOPLE MANAGEMENT IF YOUR

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:56.361 region:rollup2
EXCELLENT TECHNICALLY AND THAT'S

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:57.195 region:rollup2
GONNA CHANGE.

00:39:56.361 --> 00:39:59.197 region:rollup2
I'M WE HEARD ON OUR LAST.

00:39:57.195 --> 00:40:01.1000 region:rollup2
.

00:39:59.197 --> 00:40:03.368 region:rollup2
A HEARING FROM OF SOMEBODY WHO

00:40:01.1000 --> 00:40:05.203 region:rollup2
WORKS IN THE RESTORED OF JUSTICE

00:40:03.368 --> 00:40:06.537 region:rollup2
SERENA AND WHAT WAS INTERESTING

00:40:05.203 --> 00:40:08.072 region:rollup2
WAS THAT THEY WERE PRESENTING

00:40:06.537 --> 00:40:09.908 region:rollup2
THE RESORT OF JUSTICE TECHNIQUES

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:11.843 region:rollup2
NOT JUST AFTER THERE WAS AN

00:40:09.908 --> 00:40:13.411 region:rollup2
ISSUE AS A PATH TO. YOU KNOW

00:40:11.843 --> 00:40:15.213 region:rollup2
KIND OF HEALING FOR VICTIM AND

00:40:13.411 --> 00:40:15.647 region:rollup2
FOR THE YOU KNOW THE BETTER LACK

00:40:15.213 --> 00:40:16.748 region:rollup2
OF A BETTER WORD THE

00:40:15.647 --> 00:40:17.949 region:rollup2
PERPETRATOR.

00:40:16.748 --> 00:40:19.317 region:rollup2
BUT THEY ALSO TALKED ABOUT BRING

00:40:17.949 --> 00:40:21.486 region:rollup2
RESTORATIVE JUSTICE TECHNIQUES

00:40:19.317 --> 00:40:24.956 region:rollup2
INTO THE TRAINING AND USING THE

00:40:21.486 --> 00:40:26.324 region:rollup2
TYPES OF. OF MORE FACE TO FACE

00:40:24.956 --> 00:40:28.927 region:rollup2
AN INTERACTIVE.

00:40:26.324 --> 00:40:30.295 region:rollup2
TRAINING AS A WAY TO HELP AND

00:40:28.927 --> 00:40:32.297 region:rollup2
I'M WONDERING IF YOU'VE SEEN

00:40:30.295 --> 00:40:33.631 region:rollup2
THAT DONE IN LARGE ORGANIZATIONS

00:40:32.297 --> 00:40:35.066 region:rollup2
AND WHAT YOUR EXPERIENCES AND IS

00:40:33.631 --> 00:40:36.768 region:rollup2
THAT SOMETHING THAT'S NOW BEING

00:40:35.066 --> 00:40:38.503 region:rollup2
LOOKED OUT MORE TO COME. AS A

00:40:36.768 --> 00:40:40.104 region:rollup2
WAY OF MAKING THE TRAINING MORE

00:40:38.503 --> 00:40:41.673 region:rollup2
VALUABLE.

00:40:40.104 --> 00:40:42.707 region:rollup2
SO ALL OF OUR TRAINING THAT WE

00:40:41.673 --> 00:40:44.309 region:rollup2
DO A TRAINING TODAY IS

00:40:42.707 --> 00:40:46.010 region:rollup2
INTERACTIVE SO ON THE HANDOUTS

00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:47.445 region:rollup2
THAT WE GAVE JUST GOOD TO

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:48.913 region:rollup2
DELIVER TO YOU.

00:40:47.445 --> 00:40:50.548 region:rollup2
THE AUSSIE PLAYING CARDS ON EACH

00:40:48.913 --> 00:40:52.216 region:rollup2
SLIDE.

00:40:50.548 --> 00:40:54.352 region:rollup2
BECAUSE SUPERVISORS HAVE A

00:40:52.216 --> 00:40:55.520 region:rollup2
TENDENCY TO SIT IN THE BACK WITH

00:40:54.352 --> 00:40:57.121 region:rollup2
THEIR HEAD DOWN IN THEIR TEXTING

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:58.389 region:rollup2
WHILE THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THIS

00:40:57.121 --> 00:40:59.891 region:rollup2
MANDATED TRAINING THAT THEY ALL

00:40:58.389 --> 00:41:01.826 region:rollup2
DISLIKES THAT WE FIGURED OUT A

00:40:59.891 --> 00:41:02.961 region:rollup2
WAY NO YOU HAVE TO ENGAGE IN YOU

00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:04.629 region:rollup2
HAVE TO. BE PART OF THIS

00:41:02.961 --> 00:41:05.263 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION.

00:41:04.629 --> 00:41:07.532 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO LEARN WHAT WE NEED

00:41:05.263 --> 00:41:08.099 region:rollup2
TO LEARN AND TAKE IT BACK TO

00:41:07.532 --> 00:41:09.167 region:rollup2
YOUR WORKPLACE AND ACTUALLY

00:41:08.099 --> 00:41:10.435 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT IT.

00:41:09.167 --> 00:41:12.103 region:rollup2
SO THE PLAYING CARDS MAKE THEM

00:41:10.435 --> 00:41:13.471 region:rollup2
BE A LITTLE INTERACTIVE BUT IT

00:41:12.103 --> 00:41:15.173 region:rollup2
ALSO TAKES WHEN THEY FIRST SIT

00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:17.308 region:rollup2
DOWN IN THE ROOM. THEY SEE THESE

00:41:15.173 --> 00:41:18.543 region:rollup2
PLAYING CARDS AND IT TAKES.

00:41:17.308 --> 00:41:19.644 region:rollup2
THE DREARY NESTS OUT OF THE

00:41:18.543 --> 00:41:21.312 region:rollup2
TRAINING THAT THEY THINK THEY'RE

00:41:19.644 --> 00:41:23.748 region:rollup2
COMING TO AND MAKES A LITTLE

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:25.216 region:rollup2
MORE FUN AND WE HAVE EXPERIENCED

00:41:23.748 --> 00:41:26.517 region:rollup2
HUGE INTERACTION.

00:41:25.216 --> 00:41:28.152 region:rollup2
AND A LOT OF CHANGE IN

00:41:26.517 --> 00:41:28.720 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:41:28.152 --> 00:41:29.887 region:rollup2
GOING THROUGH THIS TRAINING

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.656 region:rollup2
TODAY.

00:41:29.887 --> 00:41:32.990 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK THAT THEY IT

00:41:31.656 --> 00:41:34.525 region:rollup2
WASN'T SO MUCH THAT IT WAS

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:36.094 region:rollup2
INTERACTIVE TO IT WAS A TYPE OF

00:41:34.525 --> 00:41:37.829 region:rollup2
OF SORT OF EMPATHY TRAINING AND

00:41:36.094 --> 00:41:38.830 region:rollup2
GETTING AT THE ROOT OF WHAT YOU

00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:39.897 region:rollup2
KNOW THE TWO OF THE IT.

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:41.232 region:rollup2
INTERPERSONAL DYNAMICS THAT

00:41:39.897 --> 00:41:43.401 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BRING THE THINGS IN A WAY

00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:45.269 region:rollup2
THAT WAS. NOT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT

00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:46.971 region:rollup2
ANY. ABOUT ANY KIND OF

00:41:45.269 --> 00:41:48.139 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT THE WAY THE TYPICAL

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:49.374 region:rollup2
SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING IS

00:41:48.139 --> 00:41:51.976 region:rollup2
BUT REALLY ABOUT MAKING PEOPLE

00:41:49.374 --> 00:41:52.543 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER'S FOR

00:41:51.976 --> 00:41:53.144 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVES AND COMMUNICATE

00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:55.146 region:rollup2
BETTER.

00:41:53.144 --> 00:41:56.881 region:rollup2
SO AT ON OF THOUGHTS AND HOW DID

00:41:55.146 --> 00:41:59.384 region:rollup2
THAT DELIVERS THAT CONVERSATION

00:41:56.881 --> 00:42:00.485 region:rollup2
SO WHEN YOU MAKE IT MORE

00:41:59.384 --> 00:42:02.453 region:rollup2
INTERACTIVE AND THEY'RE MORE

00:42:00.485 --> 00:42:03.554 region:rollup2
ENGAGED WE. ARE TRAINING

00:42:02.453 --> 00:42:05.790 region:rollup2
TYPICALLY WE TELL THEM THAT'S

00:42:03.554 --> 00:42:06.858 region:rollup2
MANDATED TWO HOURS I HAVE YET IN

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:07.959 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO DO

00:42:06.858 --> 00:42:09.594 region:rollup2
TRAINING LESS THAN THREE HOURS

00:42:07.959 --> 00:42:10.328 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THEIR QUESTIONS NOT

00:42:09.594 --> 00:42:12.497 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF OUR TRAINING.

00:42:10.328 --> 00:42:13.731 region:rollup2
AND THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY OPEN

00:42:12.497 --> 00:42:15.967 region:rollup2
ABOUT THEIR CONVERSATIONS WELL

00:42:13.731 --> 00:42:17.535 region:rollup2
WHAT IF THIS HAPPENED. AND WHAT

00:42:15.967 --> 00:42:19.203 region:rollup2
IF YOU SAW THIS

00:42:17.535 --> 00:42:20.505 region:rollup2
AND WE TALK ABOUT IT AND IT

00:42:19.203 --> 00:42:21.406 region:rollup2
COULD BECOMES MORE REAL TO THEM

00:42:20.505 --> 00:42:22.974 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IS ABOUT WHAT'S

00:42:21.406 --> 00:42:23.908 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IN THEIR WORKPLACE

00:42:22.974 --> 00:42:25.376 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A POINT OF REFERENCE

00:42:23.908 --> 00:42:27.278 region:rollup2
THAT THREE.

00:42:25.376 --> 00:42:29.213 region:rollup2
AND SO IT DOES MAKE A CHANGE.

00:42:27.278 --> 00:42:29.814 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE OPEN

00:42:29.213 --> 00:42:30.782 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESSING THAT AND I THINK

00:42:29.814 --> 00:42:32.083 region:rollup2
THAT'S.

00:42:30.782 --> 00:42:34.218 region:rollup2
PART OF WHERE THE IMPLICIT BIAS

00:42:32.083 --> 00:42:35.887 region:rollup2
COMES INTO BECAUSE WE HAVE THAT

00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:37.055 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WHERE PEOPLE GO.

00:42:35.887 --> 00:42:39.157 region:rollup2
WELL YOU KNOW THIS HAPPENED AT A

00:42:37.055 --> 00:42:40.691 region:rollup2
PLACE I WORKED.

00:42:39.157 --> 00:42:42.393 region:rollup2
YEAH THIS HAPPENED TO A FRIEND

00:42:40.691 --> 00:42:44.062 region:rollup2
THAT I KNOW AND IT'S THEIR OWN

00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:44.729 region:rollup2
BIAS IN THERE'D DO IN A CHECK

00:42:44.062 --> 00:42:46.898 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING A SELF TECH LIKE

00:42:44.729 --> 00:42:48.433 region:rollup2
IS THIS. A MILE IN THE FINE LINE

00:42:46.898 --> 00:42:50.134 region:rollup2
HERE AND SO IT OPENS UP THAT

00:42:48.433 --> 00:42:51.302 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION. LIKE I REALLY

00:42:50.134 --> 00:42:52.470 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID WHAT

00:42:51.302 --> 00:42:53.337 region:rollup2
YOU SAID ABOUT MAKING THE

00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:54.439 region:rollup2
TRAINING RELEVANT TO YOUR

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:55.973 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE WE HAVE A PRETTY

00:42:54.439 --> 00:42:57.809 region:rollup2
UNIQUE WORKPLACE HERE. AND THE

00:42:55.973 --> 00:42:59.277 region:rollup2
TRAINING THAT THAT WE DO IS NOT

00:42:57.809 --> 00:43:00.077 region:rollup2
AT ALL UNIQUE TO OUR WORKPLACE

00:42:59.277 --> 00:43:01.045 region:rollup2
IT'S.

00:43:00.077 --> 00:43:02.313 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT'S VERY DATED AND

00:43:01.045 --> 00:43:03.581 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY GENERIC AND IT'S YOU

00:43:02.313 --> 00:43:06.184 region:rollup2
KNOW BOB IN TEEN AT THE WATER

00:43:03.581 --> 00:43:08.753 region:rollup2
COOLER IN. AND WE HAVE SOME I'M

00:43:06.184 --> 00:43:10.421 region:rollup2
OFTEN TINA LITERALLY FOUGHT OFF

00:43:08.753 --> 00:43:10.822 region:rollup2
ROBIN TINA I KNOW THEM.

00:43:10.421 --> 00:43:12.457 region:rollup2
AND.

00:43:10.822 --> 00:43:13.558 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW US TRYING TO CREATE

00:43:12.457 --> 00:43:14.625 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AT LEAST YOU KNOW

00:43:13.558 --> 00:43:16.060 region:rollup2
MAYBE S. A DIFFERENT TRAINING

00:43:14.625 --> 00:43:17.695 region:rollup2
FOR MEMBERS THAT REALLY FOCUSES

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:19.030 region:rollup2
ON THE TYPE OF EXPERIENCES THAT

00:43:17.695 --> 00:43:20.498 region:rollup2
WE HAVE THAT'S DIFFERENT AND

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:22.900 region:rollup2
PUTTING US IN SOME OF THOSE.

00:43:20.498 --> 00:43:24.335 region:rollup2
MORE PROBLEMATIC SITUATIONS AND

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:24.669 region:rollup2
KIND OF WORKING THIS THROUGH

00:43:24.335 --> 00:43:25.937 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE.

00:43:24.669 --> 00:43:27.805 region:rollup2
.

00:43:25.937 --> 00:43:29.774 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS AYE AYE VISITORS

00:43:27.805 --> 00:43:31.909 region:rollup2
RIFIC IDEA AND I'M VERY GLAD

00:43:29.774 --> 00:43:34.212 region:rollup2
THAT YOU. YOU KNOW BROUGHT THAT

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:34.812 region:rollup2
TO THAT TO THE FOREFRONT OF KIND

00:43:34.212 --> 00:43:35.780 region:rollup2
OF HOW IRRELEVANT THE TRAINING

00:43:34.812 --> 00:43:37.148 region:rollup2
IS.

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:38.816 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE FROM UP FROM A

00:43:37.148 --> 00:43:40.751 region:rollup2
CONTENT PERSPECTIVE I THINK THAT

00:43:38.816 --> 00:43:42.520 region:rollup2
THE AYE SPECIFIC ITEMS THAT YOU

00:43:40.751 --> 00:43:43.654 region:rollup2
MENTIONED ARE REALLY IMPORTANT.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.523 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S YOU KNOW WHAT I REFER

00:43:43.654 --> 00:43:46.224 region:rollup2
TO AS SORT OF MY FIVE ESSENTIALS

00:43:45.523 --> 00:43:48.960 region:rollup2
OF THE LIBRARY.

00:43:46.224 --> 00:43:50.128 region:rollup2
IT WILL NECESSARILY INCLUDE

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.629 region:rollup2
WITHIN THEIR OWN IN

00:43:50.128 --> 00:43:53.297 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION BROUGHT TRAINING

00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:54.532 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE A LEVEL OF

00:43:53.297 --> 00:43:56.300 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING AND EMPATHY SO

00:43:54.532 --> 00:43:58.836 region:rollup2
THAT LEVEL YOU KNOW RATHER THAN

00:43:56.300 --> 00:44:00.671 region:rollup2
SEEKING. TO TO CHANGE SOMEONE'S

00:43:58.836 --> 00:44:02.874 region:rollup2
MIND TO CHANGE THEIR BEHAVIOR TO

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:05.843 region:rollup2
REALLY DO THINGS IN A WAY THAT

00:44:02.874 --> 00:44:07.178 region:rollup2
THE TRAINING. LETS PEOPLE SEE.

00:44:05.843 --> 00:44:08.880 region:rollup2
THE OTHER SIDE THE POINT LET'S

00:44:07.178 --> 00:44:11.182 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SEE WHAT ANOTHER PERSON

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.783 region:rollup2
MIGHT VIEW SO DELIVERING IT IN A

00:44:11.182 --> 00:44:14.652 region:rollup2
WAY THAT I THINK REALLY FOCUSES

00:44:12.783 --> 00:44:16.387 region:rollup2
ON THAT EMPATHY. THE TRICK WOULD

00:44:14.652 --> 00:44:17.922 region:rollup2
BE TO DO IT IN A WAY THAT IS

00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:19.390 region:rollup2
RELEVANT TO THE WORKPLACE SO THE

00:44:17.922 --> 00:44:20.224 region:rollup2
RESTORATIVE JUSTICE ISSUES I

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:22.493 region:rollup2
THINK ARE.

00:44:20.224 --> 00:44:24.595 region:rollup2
ANALOGOUS BUT THEY'RE NOT.

00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:25.696 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATELY ANALOGOUS YOU YOU

00:44:24.595 --> 00:44:27.365 region:rollup2
HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU PUT

00:44:25.696 --> 00:44:28.266 region:rollup2
THEM IN THE CONTEXT THAT IS

00:44:27.365 --> 00:44:29.934 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE.

00:44:28.266 --> 00:44:31.202 region:rollup2
RELEVANT TO THE WORKPLACE THE

00:44:29.934 --> 00:44:32.703 region:rollup2
OTHER WAY IN WHICH IN ADDITION

00:44:31.202 --> 00:44:34.372 region:rollup2
TO TRAINING THAT I SEE THE

00:44:32.703 --> 00:44:36.474 region:rollup2
CONCEPT OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE

00:44:34.372 --> 00:44:38.676 region:rollup2
USED REALLY EFFECTIVELY. IS AND

00:44:36.474 --> 00:44:40.344 region:rollup2
WHAT I CALL WORKPLACE MEDIATIONS

00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:41.112 region:rollup2
AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:41.979 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO BE.

00:44:41.112 --> 00:44:43.114 region:rollup2
THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE

00:44:41.979 --> 00:44:44.582 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS ESTABLISH WHETHER

00:44:43.114 --> 00:44:45.983 region:rollup2
IT'S HERE AT THE LEGISLATURE OR

00:44:44.582 --> 00:44:49.253 region:rollup2
IN PRIVATE.

00:44:45.983 --> 00:44:50.988 region:rollup2
ENTITIES HAVING.

00:44:49.253 --> 00:44:53.891 region:rollup2
AND ON THAT'S PERSON HAVING

00:44:50.988 --> 00:44:55.826 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY WHO WAS REALLY ABLE TO.

00:44:53.891 --> 00:44:57.328 region:rollup2
MEDIATE DISPUTES AT AN EARLY

00:44:55.826 --> 00:44:58.930 region:rollup2
STAGE IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT

00:44:57.328 --> 00:45:00.798 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT RESTORATIVE

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:03.601 region:rollup2
JUSTICE PERSPECTIVE IS IS

00:45:00.798 --> 00:45:05.937 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THERE. I WHEN I FIRST

00:45:03.601 --> 00:45:07.405 region:rollup2
STARTED DOING REPLACE MEDIATIONS

00:45:05.937 --> 00:45:09.840 region:rollup2
I ACTUALLY HAD A CONVERSATION

00:45:07.405 --> 00:45:11.142 region:rollup2
WITH A COLLEAGUE OF MINE WHO HAD

00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:12.944 region:rollup2
BEEN A FEDERAL MAGISTRATE AND

00:45:11.142 --> 00:45:16.981 region:rollup2
HAD IT WAS NOT DOING PRIVATE

00:45:12.944 --> 00:45:19.450 region:rollup2
MEDIATIONS. AND THAT HE CAPTURED

00:45:16.981 --> 00:45:22.887 region:rollup2
PERFECTLY HE SAID YOU KNOW PATTY

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:25.323 region:rollup2
WHAT I DO IS TO FORCE A

00:45:22.887 --> 00:45:27.391 region:rollup2
COUNSELING WHAT YOU DO IS

00:45:25.323 --> 00:45:30.928 region:rollup2
MARRIAGE COUNSELING.

00:45:27.391 --> 00:45:32.330 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN WE CAN'T MAKE TOO

00:45:30.928 --> 00:45:36.300 region:rollup2
MANY ANALOGIES BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:39.236 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS BUT IT

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:40.571 region:rollup2
IT RANG TRUE THAT WHAT I'M DOING

00:45:39.236 --> 00:45:42.740 region:rollup2
IS TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE

00:45:40.571 --> 00:45:45.176 region:rollup2
TOGETHER WHEN I'M TRYING TO DO

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:50.081 region:rollup2
IS. INCREASE AT LEVEL OF EMPATHY

00:45:45.176 --> 00:45:50.815 region:rollup2
AND FAIRS REMINDING THAT MEMBERS

00:45:50.081 --> 00:45:52.083 region:rollup2
COME

00:45:50.815 --> 00:45:53.718 region:rollup2
I HEAR FROM MANY DIFFERENT

00:45:52.083 --> 00:45:55.353 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVES OUT A LOT OF

00:45:53.718 --> 00:45:56.287 region:rollup2
MEMBERS HAVE NEVER MANAGED OUT

00:45:55.353 --> 00:45:57.722 region:rollup2
BEFORE AND WE MAKE THE

00:45:56.287 --> 00:45:58.289 region:rollup2
ASSUMPTION THAT THEY'RE CAPABLE

00:45:57.722 --> 00:45:59.223 region:rollup2
OF DOING THAT WITHOUT GIVING

00:45:58.289 --> 00:46:00.591 region:rollup2
THEM.

00:45:59.223 --> 00:46:02.093 region:rollup2
THE BACKGROUND THE TRAINING TO

00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:02.994 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE YOU

00:46:02.093 --> 00:46:04.795 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THEY REALLY UNDERSTAND

00:46:02.994 --> 00:46:06.197 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT REQUIRES AND AND EVEN

00:46:04.795 --> 00:46:07.698 region:rollup2
CHIEFS A LOT OF OUR CHIEFS COME

00:46:06.197 --> 00:46:09.066 region:rollup2
TO US THROUGH CAMPAIGNS THROUGH.

00:46:07.698 --> 00:46:10.868 region:rollup2
ALL KINDS OF OTHER WORK AND I

00:46:09.066 --> 00:46:12.303 region:rollup2
THINK THAT OFFERING THAT TO OUR

00:46:10.868 --> 00:46:13.771 region:rollup2
CHIEFS TO OUR MEMBERS.

00:46:12.303 --> 00:46:15.339 region:rollup2
IS SOMETHING THAT COULDBE

00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:16.874 region:rollup2
EXTREMELY VALUABLE HARM TO US

00:46:15.339 --> 00:46:18.209 region:rollup2
NOT JUST WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT

00:46:16.874 --> 00:46:19.810 region:rollup2
BUT HAVING A BETTER FUNCTIONING

00:46:18.209 --> 00:46:21.312 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE AND TO DISTRICT

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:22.313 region:rollup2

00:46:24.815 --> 00:46:26.917 region:rollup2
WOULD THEY DON'T COME TO THIS

00:46:25.616 --> 00:46:28.552 region:rollup2
POSITION TO THE NATURAL

00:46:26.917 --> 00:46:30.354 region:rollup2
SELECTION NATURAL SELECTION

00:46:28.552 --> 00:46:32.356 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT OTHER SUPERVISORS

DO OF WORKING THEIR WAY UP THE

00:46:32.356 --> 00:46:35.393 region:rollup2
RANKS AND HAVING TO DEMONSTRATE

ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COME UP

00:46:51.475 --> 00:46:56.314 region:rollup2
WHEN WE DISCUSS THIS CULTURE

00:46:53.544 --> 00:46:57.581 region:rollup2
IDEA. WHICH ARM YOU KNOW I THINK

00:46:56.314 --> 00:46:59.950 region:rollup2
IS REALLY.

00:46:57.581 --> 00:47:01.519 region:rollup2
THE WAY ULTIMATELY IT'S GONNA

NEED NEED TO BE ADDRESSED.

00:47:01.519 --> 00:47:05.289 region:rollup2
BOB YOU KNOW I TRY TO VISUALIZE

00:47:02.987 --> 00:47:07.291 region:rollup2
WHAT WOULD THAT CULTURE BE AND

00:47:05.289 --> 00:47:09.060 region:rollup2
IT'S YOU KNOW THE TRAINING BUT

00:47:07.291 --> 00:47:10.327 region:rollup2
THEN EVERYONE WALKS OUT OF

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:11.662 region:rollup2
TRAINING AND THEN THERE AND WORK

00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:13.431 region:rollup2
IT'S KINDA LIKE GOING TO CHURCH

00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:14.799 region:rollup2

HOW DO YOU MAINTAIN THAT

00:47:18.302 --> 00:47:21.338 region:rollup2
CULTURE BECAUSE YOU KNOW I TRY

00:47:39.757 --> 00:47:43.861 region:rollup2
INCIDENT OCCURS MAY BE. A VERY

00:47:42.059 --> 00:47:45.896 region:rollup2
SLIGHT INCIDENT. BUT.

TO KEEP YOU KNOW TO TRY TO

00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:09.520 region:rollup2
CREATE AND WE'VE EMPLOYEES

00:48:06.917 --> 00:48:11.422 region:rollup2
COMMON GOAL ALL THE TIME.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:13.224 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SOME VERY YOUNG STAFF OR

00:48:11.422 --> 00:48:15.025 region:rollup2
INTERNS THEY'RE ONLY THERE FOR A

00:48:13.224 --> 00:48:18.596 region:rollup2
FEW MONTHS AND THEN THEY'RE GONE

00:48:20.464 --> 00:48:24.602 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE SEEN SO.

OF OF RESOURCES WE PUT TOGETHER

00:48:28.405 --> 00:48:31.108 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK MIGHT BE REALLY

00:48:29.507 --> 00:48:32.843 region:rollup2
HELPFUL TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

00:48:31.108 --> 00:48:34.078 region:rollup2
ONE IS A LOT OF AT LEAST PART OF

00:48:32.843 --> 00:48:35.279 region:rollup2
CORPORATIONS HAVE BEEN TAKING A

00:48:34.078 --> 00:48:37.081 region:rollup2
STEP WHICH I THINK IS A STEP IN

00:48:35.279 --> 00:48:37.681 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT THEM AND

00:48:37.081 --> 00:48:39.617 region:rollup2
EXECUTING IT AS WELL AS THEY

00:48:37.681 --> 00:48:41.452 region:rollup2
SHOULD. OF SENDING A LETTER FROM

LOOK WE CARE ABOUT THIS ME TO

00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:45.523 region:rollup2
SITUATION WE UNDERSTAND WE

00:48:44.221 --> 00:48:47.191 region:rollup2
REALLY WANNA BE DIFFERENT.

00:48:45.523 --> 00:48:48.526 region:rollup2
BUT FRANKLY IT'S THE SAME OLD

00:48:47.191 --> 00:48:50.060 region:rollup2
SAME OLD AND SO IT'S A LETTER

00:48:48.526 --> 00:48:51.462 region:rollup2
THAT SAYS WE REALLY CARE ABOUT

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:54.064 region:rollup2
NOT HAVING UNLAWFUL ARRESTS IN

00:48:51.462 --> 00:48:55.533 region:rollup2
THE WORKPLACE. HERE'S A COPY OF

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:56.867 region:rollup2
OUR POLICY THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

00:48:55.533 --> 00:48:58.869 region:rollup2
I'VE WRITTEN SENATE TEMPLATE

ARE GOING TO TEACH A COMMON

00:49:05.142 --> 00:49:07.711 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE WHERE WE CAN

00:49:06.143 --> 00:49:09.180 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER IN A

00:49:07.711 --> 00:49:11.315 region:rollup2
WAY THAT MAKES SENSE?

00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:12.583 region:rollup2
ONE OF OUR SIGNATURE TOOLS AT

00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:14.218 region:rollup2
AND TRAIN IS SOMETHING WE CALL

00:49:12.583 --> 00:49:16.854 region:rollup2
THE WORKPLACE COLOR SPECTRUM AND

00:49:14.218 --> 00:49:17.788 region:rollup2
IT IS A WAY OF TAKING LEGALLY

00:49:16.854 --> 00:49:20.825 region:rollup2
CHARGED.

00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:22.126 region:rollup2
DEFENSIVE OF LANGUAGE THAT

00:49:20.825 --> 00:49:23.761 region:rollup2
COULD INCREASE THE TEMPERATURE

00:49:22.126 --> 00:49:24.962 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF DECREASE SAID AND

00:49:23.761 --> 00:49:26.864 region:rollup2
BRING IT DOWN TO A LEVEL WHERE

00:49:24.962 --> 00:49:28.399 region:rollup2
EVERYONE CAN UNDERSTAND IT SO

00:49:26.864 --> 00:49:31.836 region:rollup2
IT'S LITERALLY A COLOR SPECTRUM

00:49:28.399 --> 00:49:33.971 region:rollup2
ECHOES FROM GREEN. TO. YELLOW TO

00:49:31.836 --> 00:49:35.239 region:rollup2
ORANGE TO RED AND A WE GIVE

00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:37.741 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES WHERE RATHER THAN

00:49:35.239 --> 00:49:39.510 region:rollup2
SAYING YOU BIG JERK WHAT YOU

00:49:37.741 --> 00:49:42.179 region:rollup2

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:44.181 region:rollup2
HARASSING YOU SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT

00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:46.083 region:rollup2
BOB THAT WAS.

00:49:44.181 --> 00:49:47.351 region:rollup2
ORANGE A COMMENT AND AND IT'S

00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:49.620 region:rollup2
REALLY SOMETHING THAT IS.

00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:51.555 region:rollup2
OFFENSIVE TO ME AND PROBABLY TO

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:53.490 region:rollup2
OTHERS SO IT NOT ONLY PROVIDES A

00:49:51.555 --> 00:49:54.758 region:rollup2
REALLY EASY WAY FOR THE PERSON

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:58.462 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO.

00:49:54.758 --> 00:50:00.297 region:rollup2
EXPRESS ANY TYPE OF OF CONCERN

00:49:58.462 --> 00:50:02.333 region:rollup2
IT ALSO PROVIDES A REALLY EASY

00:50:00.297 --> 00:50:04.468 region:rollup2
WAY FOR BY SANDERS TO BE ABLE TO

00:50:02.333 --> 00:50:06.237 region:rollup2
SAY HEY WAIT A MINUTE EVEN IF

00:50:04.468 --> 00:50:08.539 region:rollup2
THAT PERSON DIDN'T SPEAK UP THAT

00:50:06.237 --> 00:50:11.175 region:rollup2
WAS A DARK YELLOW YOU KNOW GOING

00:50:08.539 --> 00:50:12.676 region:rollup2
INTO ORANGE COMMENT. ON THE

00:50:11.175 --> 00:50:14.912 region:rollup2
OTHER THING THAT WE FOUND THAT

00:50:12.676 --> 00:50:17.414 region:rollup2
IT DOES IN THIS GOES BACK TO THE

00:50:14.912 --> 00:50:19.183 region:rollup2
EMBASSIES UNDERSTANDING. IS THAT

00:50:17.414 --> 00:50:20.618 region:rollup2
WE HAVE FOUND AND ESPECIALLY

00:50:19.183 --> 00:50:22.386 region:rollup2
VERY VERY SPECIFICALLY ON THE

00:50:20.618 --> 00:50:25.222 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT WE

00:50:22.386 --> 00:50:25.422 region:rollup2
DON'T ALL SEE THE WORLD THE SAME

00:50:25.222 --> 00:50:26.090 region:rollup2
WAY.

00:50:25.422 --> 00:50:26.624 region:rollup2
AND SO ME SAYING THAT SOMETHING

00:50:26.090 --> 00:50:27.291 region:rollup2
IS ORANGE.

00:50:26.624 --> 00:50:28.092 region:rollup2
THE PERSON WHO MADE THE

00:50:27.291 --> 00:50:28.893 region:rollup2
STATEMENT MIGHT SAY THAT WAS

00:50:28.092 --> 00:50:29.493 region:rollup2
GREEN TO ME.

00:50:28.893 --> 00:50:29.994 region:rollup2
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:31.228 region:rollup2
DISCONNECT IS.

00:50:29.994 --> 00:50:31.962 region:rollup2
A STATISTIC THAT I OFTEN SITE

00:50:31.228 --> 00:50:32.863 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF MY INVESTIGATIONS

00:50:31.962 --> 00:50:33.530 region:rollup2
ARE CONDUCTED PEOPLE ARE OFTEN

00:50:32.863 --> 00:50:34.198 region:rollup2
SURPRISED TO KNOW THAT THE VAST

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:36.133 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF THEM. HAD NO FACTUAL

00:50:34.198 --> 00:50:38.769 region:rollup2
DISPUTE IT WASN'T A HE SAID SHE

00:50:36.133 --> 00:50:40.905 region:rollup2
SAID SITUATION IT WAS THIS IS

00:50:38.769 --> 00:50:41.472 region:rollup2
WHAT'S ALLEGED THE PERSON

00:50:40.905 --> 00:50:41.739 region:rollup2
ACCUSED SAYS YES THAT'S WHAT

00:50:41.472 --> 00:50:43.707 region:rollup2
HAPPENED.

00:50:41.739 --> 00:50:45.075 region:rollup2
SO WHAT.

00:50:43.707 --> 00:50:47.678 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS TRULY JUST A

00:50:45.075 --> 00:50:50.614 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE IN PERCEPTION AND IN

00:50:47.678 --> 00:50:52.016 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING OR FEELING WHAT

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:52.416 region:rollup2
ONE PERSON FELT WAS APPROPRIATE

00:50:52.016 --> 00:50:53.050 region:rollup2
THE OTHER FELT WAS

00:50:52.416 --> 00:50:54.852 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE.

00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:57.221 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW CREATING A COMMON

00:50:54.852 --> 00:50:59.490 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE HAVING TOOLS THAT GO

00:50:57.221 --> 00:50:59.857 region:rollup2
BEYOND JUST YOUR POLICY THE TALK

00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:03.127 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

00:50:59.857 --> 00:51:04.662 region:rollup2
PAT BUT THE UNLAWFUL CONDUCT.

00:51:03.127 --> 00:51:06.130 region:rollup2
I THINK SLOWLY OVER TIME WITH

00:51:04.662 --> 00:51:08.098 region:rollup2
ALL OF THESE THINGS PUT INTO

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:09.433 region:rollup2
PLACE OF THE MICRO LEARNING

00:51:08.098 --> 00:51:10.668 region:rollup2
LESSONS WOULD WE'VE BEEN WORKING

00:51:09.433 --> 00:51:11.802 region:rollup2
ON A NEED TO CAMPAIGN FOR

00:51:10.668 --> 00:51:14.171 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THAT ADDRESSES EACH

00:51:11.802 --> 00:51:15.873 region:rollup2
CONSTITUENCY. SO THE FIRST VIDEO

00:51:14.171 --> 00:51:17.474 region:rollup2
THAT WE PUT OUT A VERY SHORT TWO

00:51:15.873 --> 00:51:18.142 region:rollup2
MINUTE VIDEO THAT WENT OUT TO.

00:51:17.474 --> 00:51:20.778 region:rollup2
ALL OF OUR.

00:51:18.142 --> 00:51:22.246 region:rollup2
OUR AUDIENCE WAS INTRODUCING

00:51:20.778 --> 00:51:23.247 region:rollup2
THIS CONCEPT OF A LOT OF THE

00:51:22.246 --> 00:51:25.182 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT I TALKED ABOUT

00:51:23.247 --> 00:51:27.051 region:rollup2
EARLIER. THE NEXT ONE WAS WHAT

00:51:25.182 --> 00:51:28.452 region:rollup2
IF ON A TARGET AND IT'S OFFERING

00:51:27.051 --> 00:51:30.588 region:rollup2
ACTUAL PRACTICAL LANGUAGE A

00:51:28.452 --> 00:51:33.190 region:rollup2
SCRIPT FOR WHAT YOU MIGHT SAY IF

00:51:30.588 --> 00:51:34.625 region:rollup2
YOU WERE EXPOSED MISCONDUCT. AND

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:35.459 region:rollup2
THEN A HANDOUT THAT SAYS IF

00:51:34.625 --> 00:51:37.428 region:rollup2
YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE DEALING

00:51:35.459 --> 00:51:40.164 region:rollup2
WITH IT YOURSELF WHEN YOU GO TO

00:51:37.428 --> 00:51:41.932 region:rollup2
A CHARTER SAY THIS NOT THAT.

00:51:40.164 --> 00:51:43.767 region:rollup2
SO WOULD ACTUALLY AGAIN

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:44.602 region:rollup2
DECREASES THE TEMPERATURE. WE'VE

00:51:43.767 --> 00:51:45.436 region:rollup2
ANOTHER VIDEO AT A DESK

00:51:44.602 --> 00:51:46.470 region:rollup2
ADDRESSES WHAT IF YOU'RE A

00:51:45.436 --> 00:51:49.106 region:rollup2
BYSTANDER HERE SOME VERY

00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:51.075 region:rollup2
PRACTICAL UP WORDSTHAT YOU CAN

00:51:49.106 --> 00:51:53.277 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY USE TO ACTUALLY DEFUSE

00:51:51.075 --> 00:51:54.178 region:rollup2
A SITUATION. WHAT IF I'VE BEEN

00:51:53.277 --> 00:51:56.280 region:rollup2
ACCUSED?

00:51:54.178 --> 00:51:57.681 region:rollup2
AGAIN ALL VERY PRACTICAL

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.549 region:rollup2
INFORMATION ON WAYS THAT YOU CAN

00:51:57.681 --> 00:52:00.250 region:rollup2
AVOID BEING ACCUSED IN THE FIRST

00:51:58.549 --> 00:52:02.820 region:rollup2
PLACE AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:04.989 region:rollup2
ACCUSED. I'M AN ATTORNEY BUT ONE

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:06.457 region:rollup2
OF THE THINGS I SAY IS HOW PUT

00:52:04.989 --> 00:52:07.091 region:rollup2
YOU APOLOGIZE.

00:52:06.457 --> 00:52:07.925 region:rollup2
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN

00:52:07.091 --> 00:52:10.127 region:rollup2
DO.

00:52:07.925 --> 00:52:11.695 region:rollup2
SO REALLY I THINK OFFERING A

00:52:10.127 --> 00:52:13.230 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF WAYS IN WHICH

00:52:11.695 --> 00:52:15.532 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING POINTS.

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:17.368 region:rollup2
TO THE SAME DIRECTION WHICH IS

00:52:15.532 --> 00:52:18.502 region:rollup2
IMPROVING THE CULTURE. IT

00:52:17.368 --> 00:52:19.069 region:rollup2
TRICKLES DOWN AND EVERYTHING

00:52:18.502 --> 00:52:20.070 region:rollup2
ELSE JUST SORT OF FALLS INTO

00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:21.238 region:rollup2
PLACE.

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:22.873 region:rollup2
I MEAN BECAUSE ONE YOU KNOW

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:24.208 region:rollup2
HEREABOUTS THE.

00:52:22.873 --> 00:52:26.276 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE VICTIMS THAT HAVE

00:52:24.208 --> 00:52:28.178 region:rollup2
COME FORWARD.

00:52:26.276 --> 00:52:30.114 region:rollup2
THEA YOU KNOW JUST THE STRENGTH

00:52:28.178 --> 00:52:32.383 region:rollup2
IT TOOK TO DO THAT BECAUSE THEY

00:52:30.114 --> 00:52:34.852 region:rollup2
WERE JUST LEAVING IT ALONE I

00:52:32.383 --> 00:52:36.854 region:rollup2
MEAN THERE WAS NO PEER SUPPORT

00:52:34.852 --> 00:52:39.156 region:rollup2
HER HINAULT. THAT STOOD UP FOR

00:52:36.854 --> 00:52:40.457 region:rollup2
THEM AND THEY WERE ACTUALLY IN A

00:52:39.156 --> 00:52:42.393 region:rollup2
WAY ISOLATED.

00:52:40.457 --> 00:52:44.028 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW WE REALLY WANTED TO

00:52:42.393 --> 00:52:45.729 region:rollup2
THE OFFICES.

00:52:44.028 --> 00:52:48.599 region:rollup2
AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE CONSIDER

00:52:45.729 --> 00:52:50.267 region:rollup2
IT YOU KNOW THE POWER SITUATION

00:52:48.599 --> 00:52:51.502 region:rollup2
THAT'S PERCEIVED IN ONLY OF WHAT

00:52:50.267 --> 00:52:53.570 region:rollup2
THE SENATOR SAY WORLD FOOD

00:52:51.502 --> 00:52:55.406 region:rollup2
SUMMIT PERSON AND. YOU KNOW AN

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:57.474 region:rollup2
INTERN OR A YOUNG PERSON AND

00:52:55.406 --> 00:53:00.377 region:rollup2
THINGS OCCUR AND STAFF PEOPLE

00:52:57.474 --> 00:53:00.978 region:rollup2
AROUND MIGHT SEE BUT THAT WHO'S

00:53:00.377 --> 00:53:04.481 region:rollup2
GOING TO STEP IN AND I THINK.

00:53:00.978 --> 00:53:07.785 region:rollup2
EMPOWERING THE VICTIM.

00:53:04.481 --> 00:53:09.253 region:rollup2
NO IN A WAY. THAT THE PEER OVER

00:53:07.785 --> 00:53:11.588 region:rollup2
THERE AND THEY STEP IN ONE THE

00:53:09.253 --> 00:53:12.923 region:rollup2
OTHER ONE CAN FOR EVERYONE LIKE

00:53:11.588 --> 00:53:14.224 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SAYING THE CULTURE.

00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:16.493 region:rollup2
STARTS TO GROW SO THEY

00:53:14.224 --> 00:53:17.428 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THOSE LEVELS OF YOU

00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:19.430 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT LEVEL WAS THAT.

00:53:17.428 --> 00:53:20.531 region:rollup2
STEP IN.

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:22.666 region:rollup2
AND THAT PREVENTS IT FROM

00:53:20.531 --> 00:53:24.535 region:rollup2
ESCALATING TO A POINT WHERE THEN

00:53:22.666 --> 00:53:26.470 region:rollup2
WE REALLY HAVE.

00:53:24.535 --> 00:53:28.639 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE SITUATION.

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:29.506 region:rollup2
SO BUT I JUST JUST ONE QUICK

00:53:28.639 --> 00:53:32.342 region:rollup2
OTHER RUN.

00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:34.478 region:rollup2
YOU TALK ABOUT DATA AND YOU

00:53:32.342 --> 00:53:36.046 region:rollup2
KNOW HAVING DATA WHAT TYPES OF

00:53:34.478 --> 00:53:38.315 region:rollup2
DATA WOULD.

00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:39.650 region:rollup2
WE LOOK TO COLLECT FROM TO

00:53:38.315 --> 00:53:43.220 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT THAT KIND OF DATA

00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:45.089 region:rollup2
DRIVEN PROGRAM.

00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:46.790 region:rollup2
WEALTH I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT

00:53:45.089 --> 00:53:49.126 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT ARE OR APPROACHES THE

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:50.227 region:rollup2
WATER SOLUTION IS.

00:53:49.126 --> 00:53:51.528 region:rollup2
AND IN OUR.

00:53:50.227 --> 00:53:52.629 region:rollup2
IN OUR CURRENT TRAINING

00:53:51.528 --> 00:53:53.964 region:rollup2
PLATFORMS WE ACTUALLY HAVE A

00:53:52.629 --> 00:53:56.266 region:rollup2
VERY ROBUST

00:53:53.964 --> 00:53:57.935 region:rollup2
Q. AND A SECTION WHERE SUBJECT

00:53:56.266 --> 00:53:59.303 region:rollup2
MATTER EXPERTS ACTUALLY RECEIVE.

00:53:57.935 --> 00:54:00.971 region:rollup2
REAL LIFE QUESTIONS FROM THE

00:53:59.303 --> 00:54:03.307 region:rollup2
LEARNERS AND WERE ABLE TO ANSWER

00:54:00.971 --> 00:54:05.342 region:rollup2
THEM IN A. ACCURATE BUT BUT ALSO

00:54:03.307 --> 00:54:07.544 region:rollup2
VERY PRACTICAL WAY. AND WE ARE

00:54:05.342 --> 00:54:08.312 region:rollup2
ABLE TO THEN COLLECT DATA ON THE

00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:10.514 region:rollup2
TYPES OF QUESTIONS ARE BEING

00:54:08.312 --> 00:54:11.215 region:rollup2
ASKED HOW MUCH TIME PEOPLE ARE

00:54:10.514 --> 00:54:12.749 region:rollup2
SPENDING ON THE QUEUE IN A

00:54:11.215 --> 00:54:13.817 region:rollup2
SECTION. HOW MUCH TIME THEY'RE

00:54:12.749 --> 00:54:15.319 region:rollup2
SPENDING ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF

00:54:13.817 --> 00:54:16.854 region:rollup2
THE TRAINING SESSION AND IT'S

00:54:15.319 --> 00:54:17.988 region:rollup2
REALLY VERY VERY INFORMATIVE IN

00:54:16.854 --> 00:54:20.290 region:rollup2
TERMS OF?

00:54:17.988 --> 00:54:21.925 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL BLIND SPOTS WHERE YOU

00:54:20.290 --> 00:54:23.994 region:rollup2
KNOW THINGS MIGHT BE GOING AWRY.

00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:25.562 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AN UNCONSCIOUS BIAS

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:27.064 region:rollup2
TRAINING COURSE THAT ASKS THEM

00:54:25.562 --> 00:54:29.433 region:rollup2
REALLY REALLY FASCINATING

00:54:27.064 --> 00:54:31.568 region:rollup2
POLLING UESTIONS AND IN THE END

00:54:29.433 --> 00:54:33.103 region:rollup2
RESULT IN A IN A DATA ANALYTICS

00:54:31.568 --> 00:54:33.971 region:rollup2
REPORT THAT SAYS THINGS LIKE.

00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:36.073 region:rollup2
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOUR

00:54:33.971 --> 00:54:36.774 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES FEEL LIKE THEY BELONG

00:54:36.073 --> 00:54:38.208 region:rollup2
IN YOUR?

00:54:36.774 --> 00:54:39.309 region:rollup2
INDUSTRY OR EXCUSE ME IN YOUR

00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:40.043 region:rollup2
COMPANY.

00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:42.179 region:rollup2
IT HAS.

00:54:40.043 --> 00:54:43.814 region:rollup2
SOME COMMENTS THAT WE AGGREGATE

00:54:42.179 --> 00:54:45.015 region:rollup2
AND SAY YOU KNOW WE SEE A

00:54:43.814 --> 00:54:46.250 region:rollup2
PATTERN OF.

00:54:45.015 --> 00:54:47.584 region:rollup2
ALL SHARE ONE WITH YOU THAT WE

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:49.419 region:rollup2
DID RECENTLY WITH A CLIENT WHERE

00:54:47.584 --> 00:54:51.054 region:rollup2
WE SAY YOU KNOW SIX DIFFERENT

00:54:49.419 --> 00:54:52.022 region:rollup2
WOMEN SAY THAT THEY FEEL LIKE

00:54:51.054 --> 00:54:53.490 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT HEARD DURING

00:54:52.022 --> 00:54:55.225 region:rollup2
MEETINGS DESPITE THE FACT THAT

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:57.127 region:rollup2
THEIR LEADERS. THAT'S A TREND

00:54:55.225 --> 00:54:59.096 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO WATCH FOR.

00:54:57.127 --> 00:54:59.763 region:rollup2
WE ARE COMING OUT WITH A NEW

00:54:59.096 --> 00:55:02.132 region:rollup2
SOLUTION.

00:54:59.763 --> 00:55:02.733 region:rollup2
A TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION THAT'S

00:55:02.132 --> 00:55:03.534 region:rollup2
REALLY GOING TO TAKE THAT THE

00:55:02.733 --> 00:55:05.903 region:rollup2
NEXT STEP.

00:55:03.534 --> 00:55:07.304 region:rollup2
TO AGGREGATE ISSUES RELATED TO

00:55:05.903 --> 00:55:09.339 region:rollup2
Q. IN A SO THAT WE CAN THEN

00:55:07.304 --> 00:55:11.208 region:rollup2
SHARE THAT WITH EMPLOYERS TO

00:55:09.339 --> 00:55:12.276 region:rollup2
AGAIN SAY HERE'S AREAS THAT YOU

00:55:11.208 --> 00:55:13.410 region:rollup2
REALLY NEED TO BE CONCERNED WITH

00:55:12.276 --> 00:55:14.812 region:rollup2
THAT WHETHER THAT MEANS

00:55:13.410 --> 00:55:15.979 region:rollup2
INCREASED TRAINING IN THAT AREA

00:55:14.812 --> 00:55:19.082 region:rollup2
WHETHER THAT MEANS PAYING

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:20.984 region:rollup2
ATTENTION. THEREARE DEFINITELY

00:55:19.082 --> 00:55:23.120 region:rollup2
WAYS THAT AGAIN FOR ME IT'S THAT

00:55:20.984 --> 00:55:25.455 region:rollup2
IDEA OF CREATING A POSITIVE

00:55:23.120 --> 00:55:28.091 region:rollup2
VICIOUS CYCLE NOW YOU'VE GOT

00:55:25.455 --> 00:55:30.427 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE ADDRESSING THINGS

00:55:28.091 --> 00:55:33.463 region:rollup2
EARLY. THEY'RE GETTING TAKEN

00:55:30.427 --> 00:55:36.166 region:rollup2
CARE OF THEY FEEL TRUSTS OF IT

00:55:33.463 --> 00:55:37.768 region:rollup2
THEY CAN REPORT THOSE THINGS AND

00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:39.469 region:rollup2
IN THE EVENT THAT SOMETHING

00:55:37.768 --> 00:55:41.171 region:rollup2
SLIPS THROUGH THE CRACKS.

00:55:39.469 --> 00:55:43.841 region:rollup2
THERE'S STILL COMFORTABLE

THAT WE WERE THE FIRST SECTION

THAT WE COVER IS THE BASIC

00:57:02.085 --> 00:57:05.088 region:rollup2
FOUNDATION OF THE LAWS OF WHY WE

00:57:03.854 --> 00:57:08.859 region:rollup2

THAT IT'S MANDATED IN PART OF

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:15.666 region:rollup2

HE AGE PAMPHLET I MEAN.

00:57:29.646 --> 00:57:32.349 region:rollup2
IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE HOW TO SUE

00:57:30.514 --> 00:57:33.483 region:rollup2
YOUR HEART.

00:57:32.349 --> 00:57:35.018 region:rollup2
SO IT'S THEIR RIGHTS IT'S A

00:57:33.483 --> 00:57:36.253 region:rollup2
NOTICE OF THEIR RIGHTS AND IF

00:57:35.018 --> 00:57:38.188 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A COMPLAINT THAT THEY

00:57:36.253 --> 00:57:40.090 region:rollup2
CAN COMPLAIN TO THE DEVIATION

00:57:38.188 --> 00:57:41.591 region:rollup2
HOW THEY FILE A COMPLAINT.

00:57:40.090 --> 00:57:43.927 region:rollup2

PLAYING CARDS ON SLIDE HIM.

00:57:43.927 --> 00:57:47.331 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN I I

00:57:45.796 --> 00:57:49.800 region:rollup2
HADN'T HEARD OF THAT BEFORE SO

00:57:47.331 --> 00:57:51.535 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO IS WE LITERALLY PASS

00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:53.704 region:rollup2
OUT CARDS.

00:57:51.535 --> 00:57:55.439 region:rollup2
EVERY PARTICIPANT HAS AT LEAST

00:57:53.704 --> 00:57:56.073 region:rollup2
TWO OR THREE CARDS DEPENDING ON

00:57:55.439 --> 00:57:57.007 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF THE PEOPLE IN THE

00:57:56.073 --> 00:57:58.809 region:rollup2
ROOM.

00:57:57.007 --> 00:58:00.377 region:rollup2
AND WHEN YOUR CARD COMES UP ON

00:57:58.809 --> 00:58:01.611 region:rollup2
THE SLIDE SO THEY DON'T SEE THAT

00:58:00.377 --> 00:58:03.246 region:rollup2
THE WHOLE SLIDE THE BEGINNING WE

00:58:01.611 --> 00:58:05.449 region:rollup2
ASK THE QUESTIONS AND AND IT

00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:06.984 region:rollup2
BECOMES A VERY LIVELY AND AND

00:58:05.449 --> 00:58:08.785 region:rollup2
KIND OF INTERACTIVE TRAINING

00:58:06.984 --> 00:58:10.721 region:rollup2
PROCESS BUT THEY LEARN FROM IT.

00:58:08.785 --> 00:58:12.422 region:rollup2
AND THEY SHARE THEIR OWN STORIES

00:58:10.721 --> 00:58:12.956 region:rollup2
WHICH MAKES IT MORE REAL.

00:58:12.422 --> 00:58:16.026 region:rollup2
PHILIP I HAVE THE KING OF

00:58:12.956 --> 00:58:17.461 region:rollup2
HEARTS.

00:58:16.026 --> 00:58:19.629 region:rollup2
IN MY HAND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL

00:58:17.461 --> 00:58:22.099 region:rollup2
ON ME THE INNER.

00:58:19.629 --> 00:58:24.134 region:rollup2
YOU ARE OKAY OKAY. SO JUST.

00:58:22.099 --> 00:58:25.802 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ONE. THING YEAHBUT NO

00:58:24.134 --> 00:58:26.903 region:rollup2
I. I JUST I'M JUST TRYING TO I'M

00:58:25.802 --> 00:58:29.339 region:rollup2
JUST TRYING TO GET IT.

00:58:26.903 --> 00:58:30.507 region:rollup2
.

00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:34.811 region:rollup2
WHAT IS YOUR OPINION OF CLIMATE

00:58:30.507 --> 00:58:35.712 region:rollup2
SURVEYS?

00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:37.948 region:rollup2
I THINK THEY'RE USEFUL.

00:58:35.712 --> 00:58:38.982 region:rollup2
.

00:58:37.948 --> 00:58:40.450 region:rollup2
BUT YOU HAVE TO TAKE IN THE

00:58:38.982 --> 00:58:42.119 region:rollup2
CONTEXT THE PERSONALITIES IN THE

00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:42.986 region:rollup2
WORK ENVIRONMENT TO AND SURVEYS

00:58:42.119 --> 00:58:44.821 region:rollup2
ARE JUST LIKE ANYTHING ELSE

00:58:42.986 --> 00:58:46.423 region:rollup2
PEOPLE SAY WHAT THEY THINK

00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:48.358 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES YOU WANTED THEM TO SAY

00:58:46.423 --> 00:58:50.360 region:rollup2
SO IMPLICIT BIAS. IS A GOOD

00:58:48.358 --> 00:58:50.994 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE WHEN WE ASK PEOPLE

00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.762 region:rollup2
THINGS ALSO AND I WOULD NEVER DO

00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:53.797 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:58:51.762 --> 00:58:54.831 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY DO IT.

00:58:53.797 --> 00:58:56.433 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT BECAUSE THEY THINK

00:58:54.831 --> 00:58:57.300 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA DO THAT THEY

00:58:56.433 --> 00:58:58.969 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW THAT THAT IS THEIR

00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:00.270 region:rollup2
BIAS.

00:58:58.969 --> 00:59:02.239 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY UNCONSCIOUS AND IT'S

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:03.673 region:rollup2
BURIED VERY DEEPLY SO IT'S NOT

00:59:02.239 --> 00:59:06.410 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT THEY.

00:59:03.673 --> 00:59:08.145 region:rollup2
WOULD. NECESSARILY SAYING OH

00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:09.980 region:rollup2
YEAH DOUBTS WOMEN BE SO WHEN YOU

00:59:08.145 --> 00:59:11.681 region:rollup2
DO ALL THE DATA YES THE DATA IS

00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:14.484 region:rollup2
HELPFUL BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO

00:59:11.681 --> 00:59:16.186 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE PERSONALITY OF THAT.

00:59:14.484 --> 00:59:18.488 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL ORGANIZATION SO TO

00:59:16.186 --> 00:59:20.524 region:rollup2
PATTY'S POINT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

00:59:18.488 --> 00:59:21.291 region:rollup2
WHO IT IS WHERE TRAINING.

00:59:20.524 --> 00:59:22.926 region:rollup2
WHEN I DO SEXUAL HARASSMENT

00:59:21.291 --> 00:59:24.561 region:rollup2
TRAINING FOR HOT AGENCY THEIR

00:59:22.926 --> 00:59:26.163 region:rollup2
CRAZY PEOPLE THERE FUND IN THEIR

00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:26.797 region:rollup2
CREATIVE AND THEY DON'T

00:59:26.163 --> 00:59:27.664 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHY THEY HAVE TO HAVE

00:59:26.797 --> 00:59:29.733 region:rollup2
RULES.

00:59:27.664 --> 00:59:31.868 region:rollup2
IT'S REALLY JUST.

00:59:29.733 --> 00:59:33.937 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITE OF HOW THEY WORK.

00:59:31.868 --> 00:59:35.338 region:rollup2
AND IF I GO INTO A BANK AND I DO

00:59:33.937 --> 00:59:37.107 region:rollup2
IT THEY'RE ALL ABOUT RULES.

00:59:35.338 --> 00:59:38.742 region:rollup2
SO THEN I ADDRESS IT DIFFERENTLY

00:59:37.107 --> 00:59:40.677 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE TO SPEAK DIFFERENTLY

00:59:38.742 --> 00:59:42.412 region:rollup2
TO THE DIFFERENT. AUDIENCE IF

00:59:40.677 --> 00:59:43.947 region:rollup2
YOU WILL THAT WE ARE TRAINING.

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:46.016 region:rollup2
THE DOUBT IS HELPFUL BECAUSE

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:47.684 region:rollup2
THEN WE KNOW IS THE TRAINING

00:59:46.016 --> 00:59:49.519 region:rollup2
BEING EFFECTIVE.

00:59:47.684 --> 00:59:51.621 region:rollup2
DO WE SEE A CHANGE IN THE NUMBER

00:59:49.519 --> 00:59:53.156 region:rollup2
OF COMPLAINTS THAT WERE GETTING.

00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:54.758 region:rollup2
ARE PEOPLE ACTUALLY CHANGING THE

00:59:53.156 --> 00:59:56.193 region:rollup2
CULTURE ARE WE HEARING LESS AND

00:59:54.758 --> 00:59:58.228 region:rollup2
LESS ABOUT OWN MAN THIS BOX THAT

00:59:56.193 --> 01:00:00.030 region:rollup2
I WORK FOR.

00:59:58.228 --> 01:00:00.864 region:rollup2
AND YES I THINK IT IS A VERY

01:00:00.030 --> 01:00:03.033 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT THAT YOU

01:00:00.864 --> 01:00:05.102 region:rollup2
HAVE HERE BECAUSE OF THE COMINGS

01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:07.971 region:rollup2
AND GOINGS OF PEOPLE BECAUSE.

01:00:05.102 --> 01:00:10.173 region:rollup2
OF LITTLE ELECTED VERSUS HIRED.

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:12.943 region:rollup2
TYPE OF OF STAFF THAT YOU HAVE

01:00:10.173 --> 01:00:14.978 region:rollup2
SO. YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT TO

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:16.480 region:rollup2
THE DATA IS DEFINITELY HELPFUL

01:00:14.978 --> 01:00:18.882 region:rollup2
FROM YOUR LEVEL BECAUSE.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:20.917 region:rollup2
IT IT.

01:00:18.882 --> 01:00:22.519 region:rollup2
GIVE SOME FOUNDATIONAL.

01:00:20.917 --> 01:00:24.087 region:rollup2
REASONING FOR WHY WE DO WHAT WE

01:00:22.519 --> 01:00:25.522 region:rollup2
DO BT IT CAN'T BE EXCLUSIVE OF

01:00:24.087 --> 01:00:26.990 region:rollup2
ANYTHING ELSE.

01:00:25.522 --> 01:00:29.126 region:rollup2
YOU DO IT AT THE BEGINNING AND

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:30.360 region:rollup2
THEN MAYBE ABOUT SIX MONTHS

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:33.163 region:rollup2
LATER TO SEE IF THERE'S BEEN A.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:34.197 region:rollup2
IMPROVED.

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:36.867 region:rollup2
CLIMATE CHANGE I GUESS WOULD BE

01:00:34.197 --> 01:00:38.435 region:rollup2
THE. SO MOST OF OUR CLIENTS

01:00:36.867 --> 01:00:39.402 region:rollup2
RETURNS BUT.

01:00:38.435 --> 01:00:40.070 region:rollup2
BUT THAT HAVE THEY BEHAVED

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:42.672 region:rollup2
BETTER.

01:00:40.070 --> 01:00:44.107 region:rollup2
MOST OUR CLIENTS ACTUALLY READ

01:00:42.672 --> 01:00:45.275 region:rollup2
THEY RETAIN S. JUST TO DO THE

01:00:44.107 --> 01:00:47.444 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT TRAINING AND THEN

01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:48.378 region:rollup2
AFTER THE TRAINING IS DONE THEY

01:00:47.444 --> 01:00:49.746 region:rollup2
RETAIN THIS OF CONSULTANTS.

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:51.248 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE AN ONGOING

01:00:49.746 --> 01:00:52.949 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM TO HELP

01:00:51.248 --> 01:00:54.851 region:rollup2
COACH AND COUNSEL THEM INTO THAT

01:00:52.949 --> 01:00:55.952 region:rollup2
BETTER BEHAVIOR. AND I THINK

01:00:54.851 --> 01:00:57.888 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY KEY YOU CAN TRAIN

01:00:55.952 --> 01:01:00.056 region:rollup2
ALL DAY LONG.

01:00:57.888 --> 01:01:01.358 region:rollup2
BUT YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:03.226 region:rollup2
FOLLOW THROUGH AND THAT MEANS

01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:05.428 region:rollup2
THAT CULTURE HOUSE TO START

01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:06.530 region:rollup2
BEING IN PLACE. THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:07.697 region:rollup2
ONCE THEY'VE BEEN TRAINED NOT

01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:08.932 region:rollup2
AFRAID TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT

01:01:07.697 --> 01:01:10.433 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT RIGHT PLEASE DON'T

01:01:08.932 --> 01:01:11.835 region:rollup2
SAY THAT DON'T DO THAT.

01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:13.169 region:rollup2
AND THAT THEIR PEERS AROUND THEM

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:15.138 region:rollup2
CAN CALL PEOPLE OUT AND IT'S SO

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:15.705 region:rollup2
IT HAS TO GO HAND IN HAND I

01:01:15.138 --> 01:01:17.107 region:rollup2
DON'T SEE HOW IT WORKS IF IT

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:17.841 region:rollup2
DOESN'T.

01:01:17.107 --> 01:01:20.744 region:rollup2
WHISPERS DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:01:17.841 --> 01:01:21.878 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ON CLIMATE SURVEYS.

01:01:20.744 --> 01:01:22.412 region:rollup2
I'M LOOKING DIFFERENT AD I

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:24.247 region:rollup2
THINK THAT.

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:25.682 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IDEA OF IT BEING A

01:01:24.247 --> 01:01:27.284 region:rollup2
SNAPSHOT AND KIND OF YOU KNOW

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:27.884 region:rollup2
YOUR BASELINE YOU START FROM

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:28.985 region:rollup2
THERE AND THEN SEEING IF THERE

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:30.954 region:rollup2
ARE.

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:32.155 region:rollup2
CHANGES THAT MAKE I THINK

01:01:30.954 --> 01:01:34.424 region:rollup2
THEY'RE THEY'RE.

01:01:32.155 --> 01:01:35.959 region:rollup2
AS GOOD AS THEIR DEVELOPMENT SO

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:37.761 region:rollup2
IF THE QUESTIONS ARE GOOD YOU

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:39.863 region:rollup2
KNOW DATA IN GOOD DEAD IN WILL

01:01:37.761 --> 01:01:40.697 region:rollup2
PRODUCE GOOD DEBT OUT.

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:43.333 region:rollup2
SO.

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:44.367 region:rollup2
YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR INTRO

01:01:43.333 --> 01:01:44.868 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HAD DONE SO MANY

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:46.903 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS THAT THE

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:49.072 region:rollup2
MAJORITY.

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:49.806 region:rollup2
OF VICTIMS WERE FEMALES.

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:51.675 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF PERPETRATORS FOR

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:52.842 region:rollup2
MALES. I'M DO YOU HAVE OR HAVE

01:01:51.675 --> 01:01:54.611 region:rollup2
YOU.

01:01:52.842 --> 01:01:56.780 region:rollup2
BUILT A.

01:01:54.611 --> 01:02:00.350 region:rollup2
A OUT A PORTFOLIO OF VICTIM

01:01:56.780 --> 01:02:02.352 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS.

01:02:00.350 --> 01:02:04.521 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE SOME I THINK

01:02:02.352 --> 01:02:05.355 region:rollup2
THERE IS A. AND NOT I'M NOT A

01:02:04.521 --> 01:02:07.557 region:rollup2
PSYCHOLOGIST BY TRADE BUT I FEEL

01:02:05.355 --> 01:02:07.824 region:rollup2
LIKE I PLAY ONE ON TV. AND THERE

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:10.260 region:rollup2
ARE SOME.

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:13.029 region:rollup2
CHARACTERISTICS THAT I DID SEE

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:14.397 region:rollup2
BOTH END OF THE VICTIMS AND IN

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:16.466 region:rollup2
SOME CASES IN THE PERPETRATORS.

01:02:14.397 --> 01:02:18.201 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW NOT TO THE POINT WHERE

01:02:16.466 --> 01:02:20.437 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU WITH WITH

01:02:18.201 --> 01:02:22.205 region:rollup2
PSYCHOLOGICAL PRECISION. BUT THE

01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:22.839 region:rollup2
ONE THAT I MENTIONED I THINK IS

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:24.307 region:rollup2
THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE WHICH IS

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:26.610 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:02:24.307 --> 01:02:27.978 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE IN POWER CREATING A

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:29.412 region:rollup2
DISCOMFORT.

01:02:27.978 --> 01:02:32.515 region:rollup2
OF FEAR.

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:33.683 region:rollup2
A CONCERN OF YOU KNOW WHERE I

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:35.352 region:rollup2
MIGHT GET A REPORT IT NOW BE

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:36.586 region:rollup2
VIEWED AS A TROUBLEMAKER WHO'S

01:02:35.352 --> 01:02:38.021 region:rollup2
GONNA BELIEVE ME ANYWAY BECAUSE

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:38.922 region:rollup2
THIS PERSON IS MORE POWERFUL

01:02:38.021 --> 01:02:41.391 region:rollup2
THAN I AM.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:43.326 region:rollup2
I DON'T HAVE ANY WITNESSES IT'S

01:02:41.391 --> 01:02:45.695 region:rollup2
ALL GONNA BE HE SAID SHE SAID.

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:47.030 region:rollup2
SO ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:49.332 region:rollup2
THAT COME TO MIND THERE'S NOT

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:50.700 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY ONLY ONE TYPE OF

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:52.535 region:rollup2
WOMAN BUT I THINK THOSE ARE THE

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:53.436 region:rollup2
COMMON FEELINGS THAT THEY HAVE

01:02:52.535 --> 01:02:55.205 region:rollup2
THAT MIGHT.

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:56.740 region:rollup2
MAKE THEM RELUCTANT TO COME

01:02:55.205 --> 01:03:00.610 region:rollup2
FORWARD.

01:02:56.740 --> 01:03:03.847 region:rollup2

MORE THAN I WANT TO THINK I HAD

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:25.268 region:rollup2
TO GO TO.

01:03:22.866 --> 01:03:27.370 region:rollup2

01:03:36.446 --> 01:03:39.549 region:rollup2
THERE'S LEGISLATION THAT COMES

01:03:37.547 --> 01:03:41.284 region:rollup2
THROUGH HERE SO THERE WAS

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:42.552 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THAT. WAS PUTTING

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:44.821 region:rollup2
REGULATION ON THE ADULT FILM

GRAPHIQUE INFORMATION THAT WAS

01:03:51.895 --> 01:03:54.731 region:rollup2
FLOATING AROUND THIS BUILDING

THESE CHAMBERS.

01:03:58.034 --> 01:04:01.338 region:rollup2

WHERE WE HAVE SITUATIONS COME TO

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:05.308 region:rollup2
US THAT ARE NOT NORMAL THINGS

01:04:03.606 --> 01:04:08.645 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD HAPPEN IN AND BEEN.

01:04:05.308 --> 01:04:09.145 region:rollup2

USING FOR PROTECTIONS?

01:04:16.753 --> 01:04:20.023 region:rollup2
LIKEWISE PEOPLE IN PRISON WHAT

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:21.524 region:rollup2
THEY SHOULD BE.

01:04:20.023 --> 01:04:22.859 region:rollup2

THIRTEEN.

01:04:24.494 --> 01:04:27.363 region:rollup2
FOURTEEN I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:29.232 region:rollup2
IT WAS BUT ABOUT THE CURRENT THE

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:30.834 region:rollup2
EAST AND IT SO YOU HAVE STAFF

WORK ENVIRONMENT AND AND SOME

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:44.981 region:rollup2
CASES WHERE. THINGS YOU WOULDN'T

01:04:43.413 --> 01:04:46.483 region:rollup2
I'M SURE YOU WOULDN'T SEE EVEN

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:47.684 region:rollup2
IN YOUR LINE OF WORK FOR YOUR

I MAYBE YOU HAVE.

01:04:49.419 --> 01:04:53.556 region:rollup2
SO WHAT MY QUESTION IS.

01:04:51.321 --> 01:04:55.225 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU CHECK HOW DO YOU SET

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:56.993 region:rollup2
US UP FOR SUCCESS?

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:58.695 region:rollup2
IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE IT ISN'T

01:04:56.993 --> 01:05:00.430 region:rollup2
THE NORM IT ISN'T SOME THINGS

01:04:58.695 --> 01:05:02.065 region:rollup2
JUST AREN'T THE NORM HERE AND WE

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:05.368 region:rollup2
WORK WITH OUR.

01:05:02.065 --> 01:05:06.970 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES AND OUR STAFF IN.

01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:08.938 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS WHERE THEY'RE

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:10.373 region:rollup2
UNCOMFORTABLE THINGS YET TO.

01:05:08.938 --> 01:05:11.374 region:rollup2
REVIEW AND TALK ABOUT BECAUSE

01:05:10.373 --> 01:05:14.410 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GONNA BE MAKE THE

01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:15.845 region:rollup2
DECISION ON THOSE THOSE VOTES.

01:05:14.410 --> 01:05:17.147 region:rollup2
THE OTHER THING DE THE SECOND

01:05:15.845 --> 01:05:18.915 region:rollup2
QUESTION TWO IS THAT I WANTED TO

01:05:17.147 --> 01:05:21.084 region:rollup2
ASK AND I'VE ASKED THIS ALMOST.

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:21.785 region:rollup2
EVERY PANEL THAT WE'VE HAD.

01:05:21.084 --> 01:05:24.687 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE.

01:05:21.785 --> 01:05:26.222 region:rollup2
THERE'S BLOGS THAT YOU TALKED

01:05:24.687 --> 01:05:27.557 region:rollup2
ABOUT THAT AND THEN PASSED IN

01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:27.991 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE DOESN'T. BLUFF

01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:30.627 region:rollup2
ALWAYS.

01:05:27.991 --> 01:05:32.529 region:rollup2
THE.

01:05:30.627 --> 01:05:34.464 region:rollup2
WE WE DON'T HERB BUT WHEN IT WE

01:05:32.529 --> 01:05:36.166 region:rollup2
DON'T CONFORM TO LAWS WE PASS

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:37.634 region:rollup2
SOME EVEN EXAMPLE.

01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:38.735 region:rollup2
WE DON'T PAY TIME AND A HALF

01:05:37.634 --> 01:05:39.169 region:rollup2
WHEN WE WORK OVER EIGHT HOURS

01:05:38.735 --> 01:05:41.671 region:rollup2
FOR OUR EMPLOYEES.

01:05:39.169 --> 01:05:42.605 region:rollup2
AND IT'S.

01:05:41.671 --> 01:05:44.974 region:rollup2
BEEN SOMETHING THAT I HAVE

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:46.576 region:rollup2
PERSONALLY THOUGHT WAS.

01:05:44.974 --> 01:05:47.544 region:rollup2
KIND OF CRAZY I HAVE TO ABIDE BY

01:05:46.576 --> 01:05:48.912 region:rollup2
THESE LAWS A HOME BUT I DON'T

01:05:47.544 --> 01:05:50.113 region:rollup2
HAVE TO ABIDE BY THESE LAWS HERE

01:05:48.912 --> 01:05:52.148 region:rollup2
AND WE PASS LAWS THAT WE DON'T

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:53.082 region:rollup2
HAVE TO. ABIDE BY WHICH MAKES NO

01:05:52.148 --> 01:05:55.385 region:rollup2
SENSE TO ME.

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:57.053 region:rollup2
IF IT'S GOOD FOR.

01:05:55.385 --> 01:05:58.455 region:rollup2
EVERYBODY ELSE IN CALIFORNIA I

01:05:57.053 --> 01:06:00.356 region:rollup2
THINK SOMEONE SHOULD BE GOOD

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:01.357 region:rollup2
HERE AND THEN MAYBE SOME OF THE.

01:06:00.356 --> 01:06:02.692 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO PASSED LAWS IN OUR

01:06:01.357 --> 01:06:04.527 region:rollup2
STEAD HELPED SOMETIMES ARE

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:04.694 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE.

01:06:04.527 --> 01:06:07.697 region:rollup2
SO.

01:06:04.694 --> 01:06:08.298 region:rollup2

YOU THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:10.800 region:rollup2
SHOULD?

HAVE PIECES OF LEGISLATION TO

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:20.143 region:rollup2
COME THROUGH THERE JUST REALLY

01:06:19.576 --> 01:06:22.979 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT.

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:23.913 region:rollup2

THE STUFF THAT GOES ON IN THE

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:50.106 region:rollup2
WORKPLACES IS PRETTY INCREDIBLE.

01:06:47.337 --> 01:06:52.542 region:rollup2

01:06:50.106 --> 01:06:53.977 region:rollup2
AS FOR FOURTEEN YEARS I ACTUALLY

01:06:52.542 --> 01:06:55.211 region:rollup2

VAST MAJORITY OF THIS WORK AND

01:06:56.980 --> 01:07:01.017 region:rollup2
SO IN MY INTERVIEW PROCESS I

01:06:58.982 --> 01:07:02.252 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAD TO SIT DOWN WITH. A

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:03.186 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE LEGAL ASSISTANCE

01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:04.821 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE ADMINISTRATIVE

ASSISTANTS AND SAY.

01:07:04.821 --> 01:07:08.491 region:rollup2
PART OF YOUR JOB IS GOING TO BE

01:07:06.623 --> 01:07:09.826 region:rollup2
TO DO POINT SEARCHES FOUND PART

01:07:08.491 --> 01:07:11.528 region:rollup2
OF YOUR JOB IS GOING TO BE TO

01:07:09.826 --> 01:07:14.330 region:rollup2
THE WEBSITES THAT ARE VERY.

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:14.898 region:rollup2
ENOUGH DISTASTEFUL AND AND THAT

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:16.199 region:rollup2
MIGHT INSULT YOU.

01:07:14.898 --> 01:07:18.001 region:rollup2
SO VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT I'VE

01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:19.769 region:rollup2
ALSO I'M DELIGHTED TRAINING

01:07:18.001 --> 01:07:21.471 region:rollup2
SESSIONS A LOT OF CONSULTING

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:22.872 region:rollup2
WITH OF WHERE THIS COULD THIS

01:07:21.471 --> 01:07:24.541 region:rollup2
QUESTION COMES UP WHEN IT COMES

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.909 region:rollup2
TO MIND IS A. GENTLEMAN CAME UP

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:27.777 region:rollup2
TO ME AFTER TRAINING AND SAID I

01:07:25.909 --> 01:07:29.746 region:rollup2
WORK FOR AN AMBULANCE COMPANY SO

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:31.781 region:rollup2
PART OF MY JOB IS TO BE EXPOSED

01:07:29.746 --> 01:07:33.216 region:rollup2
TO REALLY GORY STUFF AND SO. BY

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:34.717 region:rollup2
NECESSITY OF MEN HAVE TO TALK

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:36.052 region:rollup2
ABOUT SEXUAL STUFF.

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:38.454 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW HOW HE QUITE MADE

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:40.156 region:rollup2
THAT CONNECTION BUT IT LEADS ME

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:42.158 region:rollup2
TO KIND OF THE TWO POINTS I

01:07:40.156 --> 01:07:43.893 region:rollup2
THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT. ONE IS

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:44.961 region:rollup2
THAT THERE IS A REALITY THAT

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:47.697 region:rollup2
THERE IS.

01:07:44.961 --> 01:07:49.766 region:rollup2
A NECESSARY COMPONENT OF A JOB

01:07:47.697 --> 01:07:51.401 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS TO JUST BE ADDRESSED

01:07:49.766 --> 01:07:53.136 region:rollup2
EARLY ON SO JUST LIKE I WOULD

01:07:51.401 --> 01:07:54.304 region:rollup2
SAY TO MY POTENTIAL CANDIDATES

01:07:53.136 --> 01:07:55.872 region:rollup2
YOU'RE GOING TO BE EXPOSED TO

01:07:54.304 --> 01:07:57.807 region:rollup2
SOME UNSEEMLY STUFF YOU KNOW

01:07:55.872 --> 01:07:59.242 region:rollup2
THAT'S PART OF THE JOB. I THINK

01:07:57.807 --> 01:08:00.743 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:01.945 region:rollup2
YOU SET THOSE EXPECTATIONS. THE

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:03.079 region:rollup2
SECOND PART THOUGH I THINK IS

01:08:01.945 --> 01:08:04.213 region:rollup2
THE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT PART

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:06.449 region:rollup2
WHICH IS.

01:08:04.213 --> 01:08:07.917 region:rollup2
YOUDON'T THAT YOU STILL HAVE TO

01:08:06.449 --> 01:08:10.153 region:rollup2
WORK WITHIN THE CONFINES OF

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:12.221 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALISM AND RESPECT

01:08:10.153 --> 01:08:13.289 region:rollup2
SO WHEN THE GENTLEMAN SAID TO ME

01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:14.958 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHEN I SORT OF

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:15.825 region:rollup2
PROSELYTISM Y. SAID I TOTALLY

01:08:14.958 --> 01:08:17.327 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND YOU WORK FOR AN

01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:19.028 region:rollup2
AMBULANCE COMPANY POLY UP TO SEE

01:08:17.327 --> 01:08:21.030 region:rollup2
REALLY GORY STUFF. BUT EXPLAINED

01:08:19.028 --> 01:08:23.700 region:rollup2
TO ME HOW THAT GOES INTO SEXUAL

01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:24.534 region:rollup2
CONTENT WELL YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.702 region:rollup2
TO STRIP SOMEONE MAKE IT I MEAN

01:08:24.534 --> 01:08:26.636 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THEIR

01:08:25.702 --> 01:08:27.837 region:rollup2
BODY PARTS.

01:08:26.636 --> 01:08:30.406 region:rollup2
HOW WAS THAT RELATED TO YOUR

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:31.140 region:rollup2
WORK AS YOU KNOW AN EMT WHAT'S

01:08:30.406 --> 01:08:32.675 region:rollup2
NOT BUT I'M JUST SAYING IT

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:35.111 region:rollup2
HAPPENS WILL YOU ANSWER THE

01:08:32.675 --> 01:08:37.280 region:rollup2
QUESTION IT'S NOT? AND SO IT'S

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:39.916 region:rollup2
TAKING THAT STEP FURTHER SO

01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:41.451 region:rollup2
BEING EXPOSED TO YOU KNOW ISSUES

01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:43.653 region:rollup2
IN THE ADULT INDUSTRY.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:45.188 region:rollup2
FILM INDUSTRY MIGHT BE ONE

01:08:43.653 --> 01:08:47.757 region:rollup2
THING SITTING AROUND AND

01:08:45.188 --> 01:08:48.725 region:rollup2
LAUGHING ABOUT PICTURES IS A

01:08:47.757 --> 01:08:50.660 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THING SO I

01:08:48.725 --> 01:08:51.527 region:rollup2
THINK MAKING SURE THAT YOU

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:53.730 region:rollup2
MAINTAIN THAT.

01:08:51.527 --> 01:08:55.565 region:rollup2
THEORY VERY CLEAR AND AND THICK

01:08:53.730 --> 01:08:57.433 region:rollup2
LINE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS IS

01:08:55.565 --> 01:08:58.635 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT. THE SECOND AND THIS

01:08:57.433 --> 01:08:59.636 region:rollup2
IS CERTAINLY WHAT I DID IN MY

01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:02.138 region:rollup2
OWN PRACTICE.

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:04.073 region:rollup2
IS BEING VERY RESPECTFUL AND SO

01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:05.208 region:rollup2
I DIVIDED UP CERTAIN THINGS THAT

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:07.076 region:rollup2
WERE NECESSARY IN SOME THAT

01:09:05.208 --> 01:09:08.211 region:rollup2
WEREN'T AND ONE VERY SPECIFIC

01:09:07.076 --> 01:09:10.079 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE THAT COMES TO MIND AS I

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:10.747 region:rollup2
HAD A. YOUNG LADY WHO CAME TO

01:09:10.079 --> 01:09:12.715 region:rollup2
WORK WITH ME AS A LEGAL

01:09:10.747 --> 01:09:14.450 region:rollup2
ASSISTANT WOULD VERY VERY DEEP

01:09:12.715 --> 01:09:16.386 region:rollup2
RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS THAT MADE

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:17.854 region:rollup2
HER EXTREMELY UNCOMFORTABLE. SO

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:19.322 region:rollup2
I CARVED SOME THINGS OUT OF HER

01:09:17.854 --> 01:09:20.890 region:rollup2
JOB DUTIES THAT WERE NOT

01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:22.558 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY NECESSARY.

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:23.292 region:rollup2
THAT OTHER PEOPLE WERE HAPPY TO

01:09:22.558 --> 01:09:25.461 region:rollup2
DO.

01:09:23.292 --> 01:09:27.330 region:rollup2
JUST OUT OF RESPECT FOR YOU CAN

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:29.532 region:rollup2
STILL DO THE JOB YOU JUST WILL

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:30.099 region:rollup2
HAVE TO VISIT A PORN SITE OR YOU

01:09:29.532 --> 01:09:31.267 region:rollup2
WON'T HAVE TO LOOK AT SOME

01:09:30.099 --> 01:09:33.669 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT. LIKE I SAID

01:09:31.267 --> 01:09:36.606 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY IN MY LINE OF WORK

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:38.374 region:rollup2
ARE AN EVERYDAY OCCURRENCE.

01:09:36.606 --> 01:09:39.676 region:rollup2
LIKE A PART TO.

01:09:38.374 --> 01:09:41.811 region:rollup2
WELL YOU'RE VOTERS WOULD

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:43.513 region:rollup2
PROBABLY SAY YES YOU HAVE TO

01:09:41.811 --> 01:09:45.748 region:rollup2
FOLLOW THE SAME LAWS WE DO.

01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:47.850 region:rollup2
IS YOU KNOW THE THING IS THIS

01:09:45.748 --> 01:09:48.384 region:rollup2
IT AS I TELL A LOT OF MY CLIENTS

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:49.385 region:rollup2
YOUR POLICIES HAVE TO MAKE

01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:50.420 region:rollup2
SENSE.

01:09:49.385 --> 01:09:52.088 region:rollup2
SO WHATEVER POLICIES AND

01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:53.423 region:rollup2
PROCEDURES YOU PUT IN PLACE THEY

01:09:52.088 --> 01:09:53.990 region:rollup2
HAVE TO MAKE SENSE FOR THE WORK

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:55.358 region:rollup2
THAT YOU DO IN THE WORKPLACE

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:56.125 region:rollup2
YOU'RE IN.

01:09:55.358 --> 01:10:00.129 region:rollup2
NOT EVERYBODY'S GOING TO HAVE

01:09:56.125 --> 01:10:01.464 region:rollup2
THE SAME RULES IF YOU WILL. AND.

01:10:00.129 --> 01:10:03.266 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT'S KEY IS THAT

01:10:01.464 --> 01:10:04.767 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO STILL WORK WITHIN

01:10:03.266 --> 01:10:07.437 region:rollup2
THE CONSTRAINTS OF.

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:09.939 region:rollup2
WHAT IS NORMALLY DECENT?

01:10:07.437 --> 01:10:11.708 region:rollup2
TO PATTY'S POINT. YEAH IF YOU

01:10:09.939 --> 01:10:13.643 region:rollup2
CAN IF YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO

01:10:11.708 --> 01:10:14.177 region:rollup2
CARVE THINGS OUT WHERE SOMEONE

01:10:13.643 --> 01:10:15.611 region:rollup2
WHO IS UNCOMFORTABLE IN A

01:10:14.177 --> 01:10:17.146 region:rollup2
SITUATION.

01:10:15.611 --> 01:10:19.916 region:rollup2
CANNOT BE IN THAT SITUATION IT

01:10:17.146 --> 01:10:22.251 region:rollup2
IN CAN DO SOMETHING ELSE GREAT.

01:10:19.916 --> 01:10:24.187 region:rollup2
IF YOU DON'T.

01:10:22.251 --> 01:10:25.621 region:rollup2
THEN YOU KNOW IT'S IT BECOMES A

01:10:24.187 --> 01:10:27.056 region:rollup2
BIGGER PROBLEM AND THEN IS THAT

01:10:25.621 --> 01:10:29.625 region:rollup2
PERSON.

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:31.194 region:rollup2
SOMEHOW. PUSHED OFF TO A

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:33.129 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT POSITION SOMEWHERE

01:10:31.194 --> 01:10:34.931 region:rollup2
ELSE OR LET GO WELCOME

01:10:33.129 --> 01:10:36.599 region:rollup2
ALTOGETHER. THAT IS SOMETHING

01:10:34.931 --> 01:10:38.234 region:rollup2
THAT HAS TO BE DECIDED AND I

01:10:36.599 --> 01:10:39.702 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH WHAT PATTY SAID.

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:41.404 region:rollup2
YOU CAN HAVE CONVERSATIONS THAT

01:10:39.702 --> 01:10:42.905 region:rollup2
ARE UNCOMFORTABLE AND YOU CAN

01:10:41.404 --> 01:10:44.440 region:rollup2
ANALYZE THINGS ARE UNPLEASANT.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:46.876 region:rollup2
WITHOUT MAKING IT THE JOKE OF

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:48.444 region:rollup2
THE DAY. AND STARTING TO MAKE

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:49.912 region:rollup2
THOSE THE UNCOMFORTABLE REMARKS

01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:51.180 region:rollup2
AFTERWARDS.

01:10:49.912 --> 01:10:52.281 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHERE CROSSES THE

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:54.050 region:rollup2
LINE IF IT'S BUSINESS ITS

01:10:52.281 --> 01:10:56.486 region:rollup2
BUSINESS.

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:58.688 region:rollup2
I'VE SEEN MY FAIR SHARE OF

01:10:56.486 --> 01:11:00.022 region:rollup2
HORRID THINGS IN HARASSMENT

01:10:58.688 --> 01:11:02.024 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS AND THEY'RE NOT

01:11:00.022 --> 01:11:03.693 region:rollup2
PLEASANT AND I'VE WATCHED VIDEOS

01:11:02.024 --> 01:11:04.994 region:rollup2
WHERE SOMEONE THAT HE WAS

01:11:03.693 --> 01:11:06.629 region:rollup2
INCREDIBLY IN LOVE WITH THE GIRL

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:07.964 region:rollup2
AT ANOTHER COMPANY. ANY CENTER

01:11:06.629 --> 01:11:09.966 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE VIDEOS AND WE GOT

01:11:07.964 --> 01:11:10.600 region:rollup2
TO WATCH HIM FOR LIKE THE FIRST

01:11:09.966 --> 01:11:12.568 region:rollup2
TWENTY SECONDS I DIDN'T NEED TO

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:14.704 region:rollup2
SEE MORE.

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:16.005 region:rollup2
BUT IF THE EXTENSION OF THAT IS

01:11:14.704 --> 01:11:17.206 region:rollup2
TO MAKE OUR HEARTS ABOUT HIS

01:11:16.005 --> 01:11:18.674 region:rollup2
BODY PARTS OR TO MAKE JOKES

01:11:17.206 --> 01:11:20.977 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

01:11:18.674 --> 01:11:21.477 region:rollup2
HIS AMOROUS INTENTIONS WITH HER

01:11:20.977 --> 01:11:22.879 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE THE LINE IS

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:24.046 region:rollup2
CROSSED.

01:11:22.879 --> 01:11:25.548 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE YOU CREATE A

01:11:24.046 --> 01:11:28.117 region:rollup2
CULTURE OF THIS IS BUSINESS AND

01:11:25.548 --> 01:11:29.452 region:rollup2
WE STOPPED THERE.

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:31.320 region:rollup2
BOB APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS I I

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:32.655 region:rollup2
WAS MORE HEADING TOWARDS I GET

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:34.223 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHOULD CARVE OUT AND WE

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:36.726 region:rollup2
WERE TO PROTECT.

01:11:34.223 --> 01:11:38.761 region:rollup2
ANYBODY WHO. IS NOT COMFORTABLE

01:11:36.726 --> 01:11:40.530 region:rollup2
IN ANY SITUATION. BUT WHAT I'M

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:41.631 region:rollup2
ASKING YOU AT SOME POINT THIS

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:44.200 region:rollup2
COMMITTEES GONNA GIVE

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:46.135 region:rollup2
SUGGESTIONS TO. THE REST OF THE

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:47.737 region:rollup2
THAT BOTH HOUSES AND OF IT WILL

01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:49.939 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH SOME GOOD POLICY.

01:11:47.737 --> 01:11:51.908 region:rollup2
IN.

01:11:49.939 --> 01:11:53.643 region:rollup2
CRAFTING TRAINING IS WHAT I MATT

01:11:51.908 --> 01:11:55.912 region:rollup2
MY POINT WAS ON THAT IS THERE.

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:56.979 region:rollup2
SUITED NO THE X. DIFFERENT KINDS

01:11:55.912 --> 01:11:58.314 region:rollup2
OF CIRCUMSTANCES A COME FORWARD

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:59.649 region:rollup2
HERE IS A IS KIND LIKE THE

01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:00.983 region:rollup2
AIMLESS SIXTEEN SITUATION WE

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:02.752 region:rollup2
HAVE WE'RE GOING TO SEE

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:04.487 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THAT IS.

01:12:02.752 --> 01:12:05.354 region:rollup2
GIVE ME A CUP OF OR SOME.

01:12:04.487 --> 01:12:06.389 region:rollup2
BUT WE NEED TO BUILD A TRAIN

01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:07.456 region:rollup2
THEM BEFORE WE GET TO THAT

01:12:06.389 --> 01:12:09.559 region:rollup2
PROCESS THAT HE WOULD

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:10.226 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION GIVES YOU THAT'S.

01:12:09.559 --> 01:12:11.794 region:rollup2
BUT YOU DON'T WORK OUT WITH YOU

01:12:10.226 --> 01:12:13.162 region:rollup2
NEED A LOT SOMEBODY KNOW THAT

01:12:11.794 --> 01:12:14.630 region:rollup2
THIS IS GONNA BE A COUPLE OF AND

01:12:13.162 --> 01:12:15.565 region:rollup2

AN ISSUE THAT SPECIFIC?

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:35.518 region:rollup2
IS TO PRESENT TO EXTREME.

01:12:33.049 --> 01:12:37.820 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES THAT I THINK REALLY

01:12:35.518 --> 01:12:38.721 region:rollup2

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:11.454 region:rollup2
SO SIMILARLY I THINK THAT

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:13.489 region:rollup2
THERE'S WAYS THAT YOU CAN SAY.

01:13:11.454 --> 01:13:15.691 region:rollup2

01:13:13.489 --> 01:13:17.493 region:rollup2
BE SOME TOPICS THAT ARE GOING TO

01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:20.129 region:rollup2
BE NECESSARILY INVOLVING.

01:13:17.493 --> 01:13:23.332 region:rollup2
SEXUAL. ACTIVITIES.

TRAINING KIND O DOING BOTH

01:13:31.474 --> 01:13:35.244 region:rollup2
EXTREMES MAKES PEOPLE GO. ALL I

01:13:33.476 --> 01:13:38.381 region:rollup2

VERY IMPRESSIVE RESUMES.

01:13:46.322 --> 01:13:50.226 region:rollup2
I GUESS WHERE I AM WITH SO WHERE

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:51.827 region:rollup2
WAS BEEN THROUGH OVER THE LAST

01:13:50.226 --> 01:13:53.596 region:rollup2
SEVERAL MONTHS IS THAT.

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:54.864 region:rollup2
STILL VERY FRUSTRATING TO KNOW

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:56.232 region:rollup2
WHAT DIRECTION WE'RE GONNA TAKE

01:13:54.864 --> 01:13:58.167 region:rollup2
AS A COMEDIAN.

01:13:56.232 --> 01:14:00.269 region:rollup2
HEARING OF WHAT WE'VE LEARNED

01:13:58.167 --> 01:14:02.638 region:rollup2
HERE WITH THEM SO THAT WE CAN

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:03.906 region:rollup2
CRAFT A POLICY. OUR POLICY

01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:06.075 region:rollup2
STARTED WITH ZERO TOLERANCE

01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:07.510 region:rollup2
NOBODY BASICALLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT

01:14:06.075 --> 01:14:10.212 region:rollup2
IS THAT MEAN YOU KNOW IF YOU

01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:11.480 region:rollup2
MAKE A. COMMENT CHAU DISLIKE YOU

01:14:10.212 --> 01:14:13.449 region:rollup2
LOOK GREAT IN THAT DRESSING YOUR

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.983 region:rollup2
CURVES IS ABOUT SOMETHING

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:15.985 region:rollup2
BETWEEN PEERS IN THE SAME

01:14:13.983 --> 01:14:18.087 region:rollup2
OFFICE.

01:14:15.985 --> 01:14:18.854 region:rollup2
WHERE'S THAT FROM A SUPERVISOR

01:14:18.087 --> 01:14:20.823 region:rollup2
TO A SUBORDINATE

01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:23.059 region:rollup2
IT'S A DIFFERENT SITUATION.

01:14:20.823 --> 01:14:24.593 region:rollup2
SO THE SUPERVISOR HAS TO REPORT

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:26.796 region:rollup2
YOU REPORT TO YOUR SUPERVISOR

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:27.930 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW JIM SAID THAT TO ME AND

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:29.498 region:rollup2
I'M OFFENDED THEN THE SUPERVISOR

01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:31.067 region:rollup2
HAVE SAY SOMETHING TO JIM DON'T

01:14:29.498 --> 01:14:33.235 region:rollup2
SAY THAT AGAIN. BUT IT DOESN'T

01:14:31.067 --> 01:14:33.669 region:rollup2
SEEM THAT RISES TO THE LEVEL OF

01:14:33.235 --> 01:14:34.837 region:rollup2
REPORTING AND FOR AN

01:14:33.669 --> 01:14:36.605 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION.

01:14:34.837 --> 01:14:38.741 region:rollup2
BUT IF IT'S A SUPERVISOR WHO

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:40.076 region:rollup2
SAYS IT TO APPEAR IN THAT COMES

01:14:38.741 --> 01:14:42.078 region:rollup2
ACROSS STATUS.

01:14:40.076 --> 01:14:43.779 region:rollup2
YOU NO HARASSMENT BECAUSE THE

01:14:42.078 --> 01:14:45.414 region:rollup2
SUPERIOR TO THE SUBORDINATE WHO

01:14:43.779 --> 01:14:47.216 region:rollup2
STARTING TO BE INTIMIDATING AND

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:48.684 region:rollup2
SHE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FEEL

01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:50.119 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE TO REPORT. MY

01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:51.454 region:rollup2
SUPERVISORS MAKING INAPPROPRIATE

01:14:50.119 --> 01:14:53.155 region:rollup2
COMMENTS IN.

01:14:51.454 --> 01:14:54.390 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE DILEMMA I SEE FOR

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:55.825 region:rollup2
ALL OF US IS DETERMINING THAT

01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:57.760 region:rollup2
CONTINUUM.

THE CULTURE BASED ON THE DATA

01:15:03.933 --> 01:15:06.469 region:rollup2
YOU'RE COLLECTING AND THAT WHAT

01:15:05.134 --> 01:15:08.871 region:rollup2

DEMANDS AND SOMETHING'S WORKING

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:29.058 region:rollup2
IN SOMETHING ISN'T BASED ON THE

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:31.093 region:rollup2
FEEDBACK THAT YOU GOT WITH

01:15:29.058 --> 01:15:32.528 region:rollup2

TWENTY YEARS I'VE HAD. THIS

01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:53.849 region:rollup2
TRAINING AS A LOCAL GOVERNMENT

BABY STEPS?

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:27.483 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT IN DOING SOMETHING

01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:29.752 region:rollup2
THAT BASICALLY STARTS TO GET TO

01:16:27.483 --> 01:16:31.087 region:rollup2
THE POINT OF PER.

01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:32.388 region:rollup2

BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:45.367 region:rollup2
COMPANIES COLLEGE YOU FORWARD.

01:16:41.497 --> 01:16:46.802 region:rollup2

WEEKS WE'RE GOING TO BE ASKED

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:53.109 region:rollup2
BACK. NO QUESTION WELL I THINK

01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:56.078 region:rollup2
THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS.

01:16:53.109 --> 01:16:58.180 region:rollup2
YEAH. THE ISSUE OF OF THAT

01:16:56.078 --> 01:17:00.249 region:rollup2
HARASSMENT.

01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:01.851 region:rollup2
IN ANY FORM. IS SYSTEMIC IN YOUR

01:17:00.249 --> 01:17:03.252 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE WOULD HAVE TO START

01:17:01.851 --> 01:17:04.820 region:rollup2
WITH YOUR CULTURE.

01:17:03.252 --> 01:17:06.055 region:rollup2
IT HOUSE TO BE WHERE PEOPLE ARE

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:07.590 region:rollup2
NO LONGER ACCEPTING THAT

01:17:06.055 --> 01:17:09.992 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR AT ALL LEVELS.

01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:12.461 region:rollup2
SO IN THE ORGANIZATIONS I WORK

01:17:09.992 --> 01:17:14.563 region:rollup2
WITH THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:16.031 region:rollup2
THAT WE REALIZADA OF WE COME IN

01:17:14.563 --> 01:17:18.501 region:rollup2
THERE FROM A VERY LEGALISTIC

01:17:16.031 --> 01:17:20.402 region:rollup2
THOU SHALT NOT TYPE OF TRAINING.

01:17:18.501 --> 01:17:21.237 region:rollup2
NO ONE'S LISTENING AND THEY DO

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:22.771 region:rollup2
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'VE ALL

01:17:21.237 --> 01:17:24.473 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE THEY GO TO THE TO OUR

01:17:22.771 --> 01:17:25.975 region:rollup2
TRAINING THEY GO OUT THEY GO SH.

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:27.910 region:rollup2
I COULD'VE BEEN DOING EMAIL YOU

01:17:25.975 --> 01:17:28.477 region:rollup2
KNOW AND THEY DON'T THINK

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:30.179 region:rollup2
ANYTHING ABOUT IT AFTER THE

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:31.981 region:rollup2
FACT.

01:17:30.179 --> 01:17:34.016 region:rollup2
WHEN WE APPROACH IT IN A

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:35.985 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAY OF SAYING LOOK WE

01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:37.386 region:rollup2
GET IT YOU'RE HUMAN.

01:17:35.985 --> 01:17:38.487 region:rollup2
BUT SO ARE THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU

01:17:37.386 --> 01:17:40.756 region:rollup2
AND YOU HAVE TO RESPECT THEIR

01:17:38.487 --> 01:17:41.557 region:rollup2
SPACE IF WE DON'T. GO IN AND SAY

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:42.958 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING HARASSMENT

01:17:41.557 --> 01:17:44.026 region:rollup2
PREVENTION TRAINING WE GO IN AND

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:45.461 region:rollup2
SAY WE'RE DOING RESPECT IN THE

01:17:44.026 --> 01:17:47.363 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE TRAINING.

01:17:45.461 --> 01:17:48.831 region:rollup2
AND IT CHANGES THE MIND SET FROM

01:17:47.363 --> 01:17:50.833 region:rollup2
THE VERY BEGINNING.

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:52.001 region:rollup2
AND WE TALK ABOUT ALL OF THE

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:53.102 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:55.171 region:rollup2
IN THE YOU BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:17:53.102 --> 01:17:58.574 region:rollup2
FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS.

01:17:55.171 --> 01:18:00.609 region:rollup2
AND. IT COMES DOWN TO THIS.

01:17:58.574 --> 01:18:02.177 region:rollup2
NOW THE SENIOR MANAGERS CEOS

01:18:00.609 --> 01:18:03.612 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVES ARE TAKING THIS MORE

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:05.014 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY AND UNFORTUNATELY IT

01:18:03.612 --> 01:18:06.515 region:rollup2
DID HAVE TO HAPPEN WITH ALL THE

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:07.283 region:rollup2
NEWS THAT WE'VE SEEN LATELY THAT

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:10.286 region:rollup2
NOW THEY'RE STARTING TO. TAKE

01:18:07.283 --> 01:18:11.453 region:rollup2
NOTICE.

01:18:10.286 --> 01:18:13.155 region:rollup2
THEY HAD TO COME TO THAT FOR

01:18:11.453 --> 01:18:15.391 region:rollup2
THEM TO MAKE THE CHANGE BECAUSE

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:15.824 region:rollup2
UNTIL THEY MAKE THE CHANGE.

01:18:15.391 --> 01:18:16.659 region:rollup2
NOBODY ELSE IN THEIR

01:18:15.824 --> 01:18:18.861 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION.

01:18:16.659 --> 01:18:20.863 region:rollup2
SO.

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:22.598 region:rollup2
FOR YOUR LEVEL YOU THAT YOUR

01:18:20.863 --> 01:18:23.966 region:rollup2
LEADERS HAVE TO TAKE THAT CHANGE

01:18:22.598 --> 01:18:25.301 region:rollup2
THE INTERNS.

01:18:23.966 --> 01:18:26.335 region:rollup2
YOU'RE RIGHT IF AN INTERN SAYS

01:18:25.301 --> 01:18:28.003 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO ANOTHER

01:18:26.335 --> 01:18:29.271 region:rollup2
INTERN IT'S REALLY NOT THE SAME

01:18:28.003 --> 01:18:31.340 region:rollup2
THING BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:33.075 region:rollup2
POWER OVER EACH OTHER.

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:34.810 region:rollup2
BUT THAT SENATOR FOR THAT IS HOW

01:18:33.075 --> 01:18:37.246 region:rollup2
WE PERSON ABSOLUTELY CAN DESTROY

01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:37.746 region:rollup2
THEIR CAREER.

01:18:37.246 --> 01:18:39.014 region:rollup2
AND IT'S THE SAME IN THE

01:18:37.746 --> 01:18:40.449 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:42.885 region:rollup2
IF I'M A RECEPTIONIST AND THE

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:44.653 region:rollup2
CEO SAID SOMETHING.

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:45.921 region:rollup2
AND INAPPROPRIATE TO ME. YEAH

01:18:44.653 --> 01:18:46.989 region:rollup2
I'M PROBABLY GONNA SAY QUIET

01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:50.025 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I'M JUST STARTING IN THE

01:18:46.989 --> 01:18:51.694 region:rollup2
WORKPLACE AND I NEED A JOB.

01:18:50.025 --> 01:18:52.661 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S JUST DOES THE FACTS

01:18:51.694 --> 01:18:54.563 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK WE'RE SEEING A SEA

01:18:52.661 --> 01:18:55.831 region:rollup2
CHANGE NOW BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:57.166 region:rollup2
IN THE NEWS AND AND IT'S

01:18:55.831 --> 01:18:58.500 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATE THAT IT HAD TO

01:18:57.166 --> 01:19:00.336 region:rollup2
HAPPEN THAT WAY.

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:02.571 region:rollup2
BUT IF THAT'S WHAT IT TOOK TO TO

01:19:00.336 --> 01:19:04.540 region:rollup2
MAKE SOCIETY CHANGE. YEAH AND I

01:19:02.571 --> 01:19:05.140 region:rollup2
THINK A SOCIETY CHANGES WE'RE

01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:06.475 region:rollup2
GONNA HOLD EVERYBODY ELSE MARK

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:07.810 region:rollup2
COUNTABLE.

01:19:06.475 --> 01:19:09.979 region:rollup2
IF HAVE IN THE COMPANY'S YOU

01:19:07.810 --> 01:19:11.981 region:rollup2
WORK WITH IS THE FEEDBACK THAT

01:19:09.979 --> 01:19:13.782 region:rollup2
WOULD THE TRAINING YOU GIVEN.

01:19:11.981 --> 01:19:15.017 region:rollup2
HAVE HELPED DRAMATICALLY. IT'S

01:19:13.782 --> 01:19:16.285 region:rollup2
HOPE FROM THE FOR A LOT OF THE

01:19:15.017 --> 01:19:18.187 region:rollup2
FEEDBACK THAT I GET FROM MY

01:19:16.285 --> 01:19:19.154 region:rollup2
CLIENTS IS.

01:19:18.187 --> 01:19:20.055 region:rollup2
FIRST OF ALL THAT'S THE BEST

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:21.624 region:rollup2
TRAINING THEY'VE EVER HAD THAT'S

01:19:20.055 --> 01:19:22.725 region:rollup2
NOT ABOUT ME THEY JUST LIKE THE

01:19:21.624 --> 01:19:24.526 region:rollup2
APPROACH BETTER THAT IT'S NOT.

01:19:22.725 --> 01:19:26.462 region:rollup2
HARSH.

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:27.930 region:rollup2
AND THE SECOND PIECE IS. THAT

01:19:26.462 --> 01:19:29.798 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT POINTING FINGERS AT

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:31.333 region:rollup2
ANYBODY NOPE WE DON'T. APPROACH

01:19:29.798 --> 01:19:33.869 region:rollup2
AT THE YOUR HORRIBLE PERSON HOW

01:19:31.333 --> 01:19:35.537 region:rollup2
DARE YOU. OF ALL THAT COULD BE

01:19:33.869 --> 01:19:37.072 region:rollup2
SOME OUT THERE BUT. WE APPROACH

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:38.307 region:rollup2
IT FROM A SENSE OF LUCK YOU NEED

01:19:37.072 --> 01:19:40.275 region:rollup2
TO BE AWARE NEED TO MAKE THOSE

01:19:38.307 --> 01:19:41.844 region:rollup2
CHANGES AND HERE'S WHY HERE'S

01:19:40.275 --> 01:19:43.412 region:rollup2
HOW IT HELPS YOUR PRODUCTIVITY

01:19:41.844 --> 01:19:44.279 region:rollup2
IN YOUR. BOTTOM LINE IN YOUR

01:19:43.412 --> 01:19:46.081 region:rollup2
COMPANY AND.

01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:47.783 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT. NOBODY EVER WANTS

01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:49.785 region:rollup2
TO COME TO WORK.

01:19:47.783 --> 01:19:50.386 region:rollup2
AND FEEL LIKE OH MY GOD I HAVE

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:52.621 region:rollup2
TO WORK WITH THAT PERSON AGAIN

01:19:50.386 --> 01:19:54.123 region:rollup2
TODAY.

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:55.791 region:rollup2
AND NO COMPANY WANTS TO LOSE

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:57.926 region:rollup2
THEIR BEST TALENT BECAUSE THIS

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:58.527 region:rollup2
PERVASIVE IN THEIR ORGANIZATION.

01:19:57.926 --> 01:20:01.196 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS PEOPLE

01:19:58.527 --> 01:20:02.931 region:rollup2
WILL LEAVE.

01:20:01.196 --> 01:20:04.233 region:rollup2
SO YOU KNOW I'VE DONE I'M SURE

01:20:02.931 --> 01:20:05.768 region:rollup2
PATTY IS IN THE SAME THING WE'VE

01:20:04.233 --> 01:20:06.935 region:rollup2
SEEN MANY PEOPLE LOSE GREAT

01:20:05.768 --> 01:20:08.704 region:rollup2
TALENT.

01:20:06.935 --> 01:20:10.973 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT ONE PERSON WHO THEY

01:20:08.704 --> 01:20:13.475 region:rollup2
JUST COULDN'T DO WITHOUT.

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:14.009 region:rollup2
IS STILL THERE AND SO THEY LOSE

01:20:13.475 --> 01:20:15.944 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE OF THEIR BEST

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:17.246 region:rollup2
PEOPLE.

01:20:15.944 --> 01:20:18.614 region:rollup2
AND EVENTUALLY PEOPLE GO ON ALL

01:20:17.246 --> 01:20:20.115 region:rollup2
THE SOCIAL MEDIA THEY SAY DON'T

01:20:18.614 --> 01:20:21.250 region:rollup2
WORK FOR THAT COMPANY BECAUSE

01:20:20.115 --> 01:20:22.685 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHERE KATHY WORKS AND

01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:24.386 region:rollup2
SHE'S A HORRIBLE BOSS. AND

01:20:22.685 --> 01:20:26.388 region:rollup2
HERE'S WHAT SHE DOES.

01:20:24.386 --> 01:20:27.923 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS IT GOES ALL THE WAY

01:20:26.388 --> 01:20:28.891 region:rollup2
DOWN THE LINE AND THAT COULD BE

01:20:27.923 --> 01:20:30.225 region:rollup2
IN YOUR ORGANIZATION TO DON'T

01:20:28.891 --> 01:20:33.796 region:rollup2
WORK FOR THAT SENATOR. AND

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:35.698 region:rollup2
HERE'S WHY.

01:20:33.796 --> 01:20:36.131 region:rollup2
SO I'VE GOTTEN MUCH MORE TO SAY

01:20:35.698 --> 01:20:38.534 region:rollup2
ON TRAINING EXCEPT.

01:20:36.131 --> 01:20:40.736 region:rollup2
TO REITERATE THE POINT THE

01:20:38.534 --> 01:20:42.137 region:rollup2
TRAINING HAS TO BE A PIECE OF

01:20:40.736 --> 01:20:44.707 region:rollup2
THE PUZZLE. NOT THE PUZZLE

01:20:42.137 --> 01:20:45.307 region:rollup2
ITSELF AND SO IT IT'S JUST NOT

01:20:44.707 --> 01:20:46.141 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE EFFECTIVE IF IT'S

01:20:45.307 --> 01:20:48.377 region:rollup2
TODD.

01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:50.379 region:rollup2
A SMALL PART OF A MUCH MORE

01:20:48.377 --> 01:20:52.414 region:rollup2
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN SO WITH THAT

01:20:50.379 --> 01:20:54.016 region:rollup2
IN MIND VERY VISUAL AND SO FOR

01:20:52.414 --> 01:20:56.018 region:rollup2
ME ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

01:20:54.016 --> 01:20:57.619 region:rollup2
THINK IS. HELPFUL TO VISUALIZE

01:20:56.018 --> 01:21:00.189 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT AN

01:20:57.619 --> 01:21:01.790 region:rollup2
OVERHAUL. IS PRE REPORT AND POST

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:04.126 region:rollup2
REPORT.

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:04.693 region:rollup2
SO PREBOR PORT TO ME IS WHERE

01:21:04.126 --> 01:21:05.594 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:06.995 region:rollup2
DONE.

01:21:05.594 --> 01:21:09.098 region:rollup2
AS THE STATISTICS THAT I SHARED

01:21:06.995 --> 01:21:09.932 region:rollup2
SHOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:21:09.098 --> 01:21:11.100 region:rollup2
COMPLAINTS START EVERITT

01:21:09.932 --> 01:21:12.368 region:rollup2
REPORTED THEY NEVER GET TO A

01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:14.136 region:rollup2
POINT WHERE WE WERE GIVEN AN

01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:15.671 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY. NOW IN SOME CASES

01:21:14.136 --> 01:21:17.206 region:rollup2
THAT'S OKAY IT'S BECAUSE. THAT

01:21:15.671 --> 01:21:18.340 region:rollup2
WE ARE HOPEFULLY EMPOWERING

01:21:17.206 --> 01:21:19.808 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SOLVE

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:21.243 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS ON THE ROAD AND THAT'S

01:21:19.808 --> 01:21:23.045 region:rollup2
A REALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENT.

01:21:21.243 --> 01:21:24.513 region:rollup2
DOTS WERE TOOLS LIKE A WORKPLACE

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:25.948 region:rollup2
COLOR SPECTRUM THAT'S FOR TOOLS

01:21:24.513 --> 01:21:27.349 region:rollup2
LIKE COMMUNICATION SKILLS I

01:21:25.948 --> 01:21:28.851 region:rollup2
THINK IT REALLY GOAL LONG WAY

01:21:27.349 --> 01:21:30.753 region:rollup2
TOWARDS HELPING TO DIFFUSE

01:21:28.851 --> 01:21:31.954 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS VERY EARLY. SO THERE

01:21:30.753 --> 01:21:33.789 region:rollup2
ARE WAYS THAT I THINK.

01:21:31.954 --> 01:21:35.924 region:rollup2
YOU CAN VERY EFFECTIVELY CREATE

01:21:33.789 --> 01:21:37.292 region:rollup2
A CULTURE OF TRUTH TELLING NOT

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:38.961 region:rollup2
ONLY IN TERMS OF TELLING THE

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:40.629 region:rollup2
TRUTH IN A FORMAL REPORT. BUT

01:21:38.961 --> 01:21:42.398 region:rollup2
BEING TRUTHFUL WITH EACH OTHER

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:43.999 region:rollup2
BEING SUPPORTIVE OF EACH OTHER

01:21:42.398 --> 01:21:45.667 region:rollup2
AND HAVING A CULTURE WHERE NOT

01:21:43.999 --> 01:21:46.969 region:rollup2
ONLY THE VICTIM SPEAKS UP BUT

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:49.037 region:rollup2
THE.

01:21:46.969 --> 01:21:50.773 region:rollup2
BYSTANDER SPEAK UP AND AND THEN

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:53.442 region:rollup2
A KEY COMPONENT IS WHERE THE

01:21:50.773 --> 01:21:55.811 region:rollup2
PERSON ACCUSED IS MATURE ENOUGH

01:21:53.442 --> 01:21:58.480 region:rollup2
TO SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT. I'M SORRY

01:21:55.811 --> 01:21:58.947 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT AND I'M

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:01.417 region:rollup2
GONNA LEARN FROM IT.

01:21:58.947 --> 01:22:03.185 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S SORT OF THE PRE REPORT

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:04.319 region:rollup2
THE POST REPORT YOU KNOW I'VE

01:22:03.185 --> 01:22:05.821 region:rollup2
COME UP WITH A REALLY SIMPLE

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:07.623 region:rollup2
THREE STEP PROCESS OF YOU DO

01:22:05.821 --> 01:22:09.792 region:rollup2
RECEIVE A REPORT. YOU TAKE IT

01:22:07.623 --> 01:22:11.360 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY YOU INVESTIGATE IT

01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:13.962 region:rollup2
WELL AND YOU FIX THE PROBLEM.

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:15.764 region:rollup2
I'VE SEEN TO MANY INSTANCES

01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:18.033 region:rollup2
WHERE SOMEBODY COMES TO.

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:19.134 region:rollup2
THAT THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITY

01:22:18.033 --> 01:22:20.702 region:rollup2
IF YOU WILL AND SAYS YOU KNOW I

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:23.138 region:rollup2
HAVE SOMETHING TO REPORT.

01:22:20.702 --> 01:22:24.673 region:rollup2
AND THE REACTION IS WELL THAT'S

01:22:23.138 --> 01:22:27.009 region:rollup2
JUST BOB YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:28.710 region:rollup2
WHAT BOB IS. SO TAKING IT

01:22:27.009 --> 01:22:30.212 region:rollup2
SERIOUSLY OF THE VERY FIRST STEP

01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:32.414 region:rollup2
THE NEXT IS PERFORMING A REALLY

01:22:30.212 --> 01:22:34.216 region:rollup2
THOROUGH AND FAIR INVESTIGATION.

01:22:32.414 --> 01:22:35.250 region:rollup2
BUT WHERE I SEE.

01:22:34.216 --> 01:22:36.752 region:rollup2
.

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:38.353 region:rollup2
THE BIGGEST ISSUES IS ON THE

01:22:36.752 --> 01:22:40.389 region:rollup2
THIRD STEP WHICH IS FIXING IT.

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:42.991 region:rollup2
SO THE HIGH VALUE EMPLOYEE ISSUE

01:22:40.389 --> 01:22:44.526 region:rollup2
COMES AND A VERY PRACTICAL TOOL

01:22:42.991 --> 01:22:46.428 region:rollup2
THAT I'VE AND PROVIDE ITS MIKE

01:22:44.526 --> 01:22:47.563 region:rollup2
TWO THINGS THAT PROVIDE TO MY

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:49.364 region:rollup2
CLIENTS ONE IS.

01:22:47.563 --> 01:22:50.566 region:rollup2
PUT THE BEHAVIOR BEFORE YOU EVEN

01:22:49.364 --> 01:22:51.967 region:rollup2
START THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOUR

01:22:50.566 --> 01:22:53.001 region:rollup2
SOLUTION IS GOING TO BE. IN A

01:22:51.967 --> 01:22:54.770 region:rollup2
RANGE

01:22:53.001 --> 01:22:56.305 region:rollup2
SO IF IT'S ON A SCALE OF ONE TO

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:58.640 region:rollup2
TEN IS THE MISCONDUCT THAT WE'RE

01:22:56.305 --> 01:23:00.409 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT A ONE OR TWO.

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:01.877 region:rollup2
RISEN IN EIGHT OR NINE BECAUSE

01:23:00.409 --> 01:23:03.745 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY GOING TO INFORM

01:23:01.877 --> 01:23:05.514 region:rollup2
WHAT IS THAT YOU'RE GONNA DO IS

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:06.014 region:rollup2
THIS SOMETHING THAT'S POSSIBLY A

01:23:05.514 --> 01:23:07.015 region:rollup2
TERMINATION INTERMINABLE

01:23:06.014 --> 01:23:08.283 region:rollup2
OFFENSE.

01:23:07.015 --> 01:23:10.118 region:rollup2
OR ARE WE TALKING ABOUT TWO

01:23:08.283 --> 01:23:12.488 region:rollup2
INTERNS WHO BAPTISM YOU DO

01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:13.856 region:rollup2
NOTHING BUT IT MEANS THAT YOUR

01:23:12.488 --> 01:23:16.458 region:rollup2
ULTIMATE REMEDY IS GOING TO BE A

01:23:13.856 --> 01:23:17.459 region:rollup2
VERY DIFFERENT THING THAN IF THE

01:23:16.458 --> 01:23:18.494 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR IS MUCH MORE CREATURES.

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:20.562 region:rollup2
TAKE OTHER FACTORS INTO

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:22.264 region:rollup2
CONSIDERATION IS THIS THE FIRST

01:23:20.562 --> 01:23:23.565 region:rollup2
TIME OR IS IT THE TWENTIETH TIME

01:23:22.264 --> 01:23:25.000 region:rollup2
THAT THIS PERSON HAS ENGAGED IN

01:23:23.565 --> 01:23:27.436 region:rollup2
THIS TYPE OF CONDUCT. AND ALL

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.004 region:rollup2
THAT WHAT I THE FREEZE THAT I

01:23:27.436 --> 01:23:30.439 region:rollup2
THAT I CLEAN FOR MY CLIENTS AS I

01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:31.640 region:rollup2
WOULD GIVE THEM WHEN I CALLED

01:23:30.439 --> 01:23:33.942 region:rollup2
MYSELF WHICH ABILITY SCALE.

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:35.711 region:rollup2
SO ARE BY SALVAGEABLE HE READING

01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:37.512 region:rollup2
OUT SO AFTER I SPOKE TO THE

01:23:35.711 --> 01:23:38.547 region:rollup2
PERSON ACCUSED OF MISCONDUCT.

01:23:37.512 --> 01:23:40.716 region:rollup2
I WOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD READ

01:23:38.547 --> 01:23:42.517 region:rollup2
ON IS THIS PERSON UNDERSTANDING.

01:23:40.716 --> 01:23:43.819 region:rollup2
.

01:23:42.517 --> 01:23:44.920 region:rollup2
THE SEVERITY OF THE BEHAVIOR

01:23:43.819 --> 01:23:46.088 region:rollup2
THAT THEY ENGAGE CENTER THEY

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.890 region:rollup2
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT ARE

01:23:46.088 --> 01:23:49.258 region:rollup2
THE STUFF AWARE ENOUGH. TO

01:23:47.890 --> 01:23:51.393 region:rollup2
REALLY BE WILLING TO MAKE SOME

01:23:49.258 --> 01:23:52.794 region:rollup2
CHANGES UP OF COURSE IN THE IN

01:23:51.393 --> 01:23:53.295 region:rollup2
THE CASES WHERE I FOUND THAT

01:23:52.794 --> 01:23:54.096 region:rollup2
THERE WAS SOME LEVEL OF

01:23:53.295 --> 01:23:56.164 region:rollup2
MISCONDUCT.

01:23:54.096 --> 01:23:57.733 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S THE PART WHERE I THINK

01:23:56.164 --> 01:24:01.370 region:rollup2
WE REALLY NEED TO BE.

01:23:57.733 --> 01:24:03.739 region:rollup2
METICULOUS ABOUT THE FACT THAT

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:05.374 region:rollup2
THERE IS A RANGE AND A PERSON

01:24:03.739 --> 01:24:07.276 region:rollup2
WHO IS YOU KNOW ACCUSED EVER

01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:08.911 region:rollup2
FOUND TO ENGAGE IN MISCONDUCT

01:24:07.276 --> 01:24:10.579 region:rollup2
THAT'S A ONE. IS NOT GONNA

01:24:08.911 --> 01:24:12.981 region:rollup2
RECEIVE A DISCIPLINARY MEASURE

01:24:10.579 --> 01:24:14.049 region:rollup2
THAT'S A TEN. AND CONVERSELY

01:24:12.981 --> 01:24:15.684 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO IS FOUND TO ENGAGE

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:16.919 region:rollup2
AN EGREGIOUS BEHAVIOR SHOULDN'T

01:24:15.684 --> 01:24:18.253 region:rollup2
GET A ONE.

01:24:16.919 --> 01:24:20.355 region:rollup2
THE FINAL THING I'LL SAY ON THAT

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:20.889 region:rollup2
WHERE I THINK ENTITIES IN

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:22.324 region:rollup2
GENERAL WHETHER PUBLIC OR

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:23.225 region:rollup2
PRIVATE.

01:24:22.324 --> 01:24:24.459 region:rollup2
I REALLY HAVE BEEN HIS

01:24:23.225 --> 01:24:26.295 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE DOES

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:27.963 region:rollup2
SEEM TO BE THIS IDEA THAT YOU

01:24:26.295 --> 01:24:29.064 region:rollup2
EITHER DO NOTHING. OR YOU FIRE

01:24:27.963 --> 01:24:30.699 region:rollup2
SOMEONE.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:32.701 region:rollup2
THERE A MILLION THINGS IN

01:24:30.699 --> 01:24:34.736 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THAT CAN BE DONE THAT

01:24:32.701 --> 01:24:36.038 region:rollup2
ARE EFFECTIVE AND PART OF THAT

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:36.872 region:rollup2
SALVAGEABLE THE READING THAT I

01:24:36.038 --> 01:24:39.174 region:rollup2
WOULD GIVE TO MY CLIENTS WOULD

01:24:36.872 --> 01:24:40.943 region:rollup2
BE. HERE'S WHAT I FOUND OUT

01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:43.211 region:rollup2
ABOUT FOR A DURING MY INTERVIEW

01:24:40.943 --> 01:24:45.247 region:rollup2
HE IS MOTIVATED ALMOST SOLELY BY

01:24:43.211 --> 01:24:47.282 region:rollup2
PRESTIGE AND MONEY. AND SO YOU

01:24:45.247 --> 01:24:49.318 region:rollup2
STANDING UP TO ONE HOUR TRAINING

01:24:47.282 --> 01:24:51.119 region:rollup2
SESSION IS GOING TO DO NOTHING.

01:24:49.318 --> 01:24:53.088 region:rollup2
YOU DEMOTING HIM. YOU TAKING HIS

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:54.923 region:rollup2
BONUS AWAY YOU TAKING AWAY A

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:56.658 region:rollup2
CHAIRMANSHIP BORROWER OR SOME

01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:58.126 region:rollup2
OTHER IMPORTANT POSITION NOW

01:24:56.658 --> 01:24:59.194 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO SEND A MESSAGE.

01:24:58.126 --> 01:25:01.029 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK REALLY BEING

01:24:59.194 --> 01:25:02.798 region:rollup2
METICULOUS ABOUT HOW IT IS THAT

01:25:01.029 --> 01:25:03.966 region:rollup2
WE APPROACH NOT JUST. THE

01:25:02.798 --> 01:25:06.101 region:rollup2
RECEIVING OF COMPLAINTS IN THE

01:25:03.966 --> 01:25:07.269 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATING OF COMPLAINTS BUT

01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:07.936 region:rollup2
RESOLVING THEM.

01:25:07.269 --> 01:25:09.471 region:rollup2
THE KEY THAT HELPS A LOT IN

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:10.906 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE.

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:12.374 region:rollup2
THE CONTINUE OF CONSEQUENCE

01:25:10.906 --> 01:25:14.042 region:rollup2
BRITAIN WHETHER THAT STARTS TO

01:25:12.374 --> 01:25:16.611 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE CULTURE KNOWING THAT

01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:18.714 region:rollup2
YOU IF YOU ARE THE PERPETRATOR.

01:25:16.611 --> 01:25:20.749 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW HERE'S HERE'S THE AYE

01:25:18.714 --> 01:25:24.720 region:rollup2

THANK YOU.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:27.356 region:rollup2
THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:29.992 region:rollup2
THE PANEL.

01:25:27.356 --> 01:25:31.560 region:rollup2
SENATOR MITCHELL DIDN'T.

01:25:29.992 --> 01:25:34.062 region:rollup2
GLAD I MADE IT BACK BUT TO HEAR

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.631 region:rollup2
SENATOR BATES QUESTION WITH

01:25:34.062 --> 01:25:38.066 region:rollup2
REGARD TO CULTURE.

01:25:35.631 --> 01:25:39.568 region:rollup2
AND I IN HEARING YOU ARTICULATE

01:25:38.066 --> 01:25:41.970 region:rollup2
YOUR QUESTION.

01:25:39.568 --> 01:25:42.471 region:rollup2
SENATOR BATES SAID IT I REALIZED

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:45.540 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:25:42.471 --> 01:25:47.075 region:rollup2
LONELY START THIS PROCESS.

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:48.243 region:rollup2
I HAD A GENERAL IDEA OF WHAT I

01:25:47.075 --> 01:25:49.711 region:rollup2
THOUGHT THE INSTITUTION SHOULD

01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:53.281 region:rollup2
DO.

01:25:49.711 --> 01:25:55.417 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE HEARING PROCESS AS

01:25:53.281 --> 01:25:57.219 region:rollup2
FAR AYE THEN MOVED TO A PLACE OF

01:25:55.417 --> 01:25:58.520 region:rollup2
OVERWHELM BASED ON ALL THE

01:25:57.219 --> 01:26:00.655 region:rollup2
INFORMATION WE ARE RECEIVING.

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:03.258 region:rollup2
.

01:26:00.655 --> 01:26:05.527 region:rollup2
AND I FEEL THAT I'VE COME FULL

01:26:03.258 --> 01:26:07.295 region:rollup2
CIRCLE.

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:10.132 region:rollup2
TO A PLACE WHERE.

01:26:07.295 --> 01:26:12.334 region:rollup2
IF WE. THIS COMMITTEE IS GOING

01:26:10.132 --> 01:26:13.902 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THE COLLECTIVE COURAGE

01:26:12.334 --> 01:26:16.371 region:rollup2
TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO THE

01:26:13.902 --> 01:26:19.107 region:rollup2
JOINT RULES.

01:26:16.371 --> 01:26:21.810 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGING A NEED FOR CULTURE

01:26:19.107 --> 01:26:24.479 region:rollup2
CHANGE THAT WE HAVE TO PROPOSED

01:26:21.810 --> 01:26:25.781 region:rollup2
RADICAL CHANGE.

01:26:24.479 --> 01:26:28.884 region:rollup2
AND IN HEARING THE EXAMPLES

01:26:25.781 --> 01:26:30.886 region:rollup2
TODAY ABOUT TRAINING THAT WORKS.

01:26:28.884 --> 01:26:32.821 region:rollup2
AND HOW DIFFERENT IT IS FROM THE

01:26:30.886 --> 01:26:35.223 region:rollup2
TRAINING WE EXPERIENCE.

01:26:32.821 --> 01:26:37.059 region:rollup2
I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT IF

01:26:35.223 --> 01:26:37.559 region:rollup2
WE.

01:26:37.059 --> 01:26:40.262 region:rollup2
LOOK AT CULTURE LOOK AT

01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:42.764 region:rollup2
TRAINING.

01:26:40.262 --> 01:26:44.266 region:rollup2
AND REALLY HAVE A HOLISTIC VIEW

01:26:42.764 --> 01:26:46.101 region:rollup2
OF OF IT BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT

01:26:44.266 --> 01:26:46.601 region:rollup2
BUT WE HAVE LEARNED IN THESE

01:26:46.101 --> 01:26:49.738 region:rollup2
FIVE HEARINGS HAVE BEEN

01:26:46.601 --> 01:26:51.273 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT. IF WE CHOOSE TO DO

01:26:49.738 --> 01:26:53.575 region:rollup2
SOME DIFFERENT IT WILL BE ON US

01:26:51.273 --> 01:26:55.877 region:rollup2
NOT BECAUSE THE MESSAGES WE

01:26:53.575 --> 01:26:57.679 region:rollup2
SEEMED WERE NOT CONSISTENT. IN

01:26:55.877 --> 01:26:59.081 region:rollup2
TERMS OF WHAT RESEARCH AND WHAT

01:26:57.679 --> 01:27:00.949 region:rollup2
PRACTICE.

01:26:59.081 --> 01:27:02.117 region:rollup2
IS TELLING US WHAT WORK AND SO

01:27:00.949 --> 01:27:05.454 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO BE UP TO US TO

01:27:02.117 --> 01:27:07.322 region:rollup2
REALLY DECIDE TO RECOMMEND

01:27:05.454 --> 01:27:08.256 region:rollup2
RADICAL CHANGE.

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:09.658 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT WE DO

01:27:08.256 --> 01:27:11.493 region:rollup2
HAVE WITH THE TWO NAMES AT THE

RIDICULOUSLY LAME EXAMPLE IN OUR

01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:26.308 region:rollup2
TRAINING AND IT'S NOT GERMANE TO

01:27:24.439 --> 01:27:27.642 region:rollup2
WHAT WE DO. AND AND WHILE WE

DIFFERENT. AND WE ARE AND

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:35.450 region:rollup2
THEREFORE OUR TRAINING SHOULD

01:27:35.150 --> 01:27:36.585 region:rollup2
REFLECT THAT

01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:37.953 region:rollup2

BURSTS WE CALL THEM IS IT A WAY

01:28:20.262 --> 01:28:23.798 region:rollup2
OF STRENGTHENING OF REINFORCING

01:28:22.697 --> 01:28:25.333 region:rollup2

01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.896 region:rollup2
REFERENCED ALREADY IS A GUIDE

01:28:53.628 --> 01:28:56.698 region:rollup2
THAT I HAVE FOUR PEOPLE WERE

01:28:54.896 --> 01:28:58.934 region:rollup2
TARGETS AND SO IN ADDITION TO

01:28:56.698 --> 01:29:01.269 region:rollup2
THE VIDEO THERE'S ACTUALLY HAND

01:28:58.934 --> 01:29:02.804 region:rollup2
OUT THAT SAYS. HERE'S THREE

01:29:01.269 --> 01:29:04.206 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT WAYS THAT YOU MIGHT BE

01:29:02.804 --> 01:29:06.575 region:rollup2
ABLE TO SAY TO SOMEBODY IF YOU

01:29:04.206 --> 01:29:08.944 region:rollup2
FIND YOURSELF IN A POSITION.

01:29:06.575 --> 01:29:11.980 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU'RE BEING EXPOSED TO

01:29:08.944 --> 01:29:14.216 region:rollup2
SOME TYPE OF BEHAVIOR ABOUT WHAT

01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:17.118 region:rollup2
WE FOUND IS THAT PEOPLE

01:29:14.216 --> 01:29:19.988 region:rollup2
OFTENTIMES JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT

01:29:17.118 --> 01:29:22.357 region:rollup2
TO SAY OR HOW TO SAY IT? AND SO

01:29:19.988 --> 01:29:24.492 region:rollup2
THIS IS A SCRIPT THAT SAYS IF

01:29:22.357 --> 01:29:26.928 region:rollup2
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE DEALING WITH

01:29:24.492 --> 01:29:27.529 region:rollup2
IT YOURSELF HERE SOME EXAMPLES

01:29:26.928 --> 01:29:29.297 region:rollup2
OF THE WAYS YOU CAN DEAL WITH

01:29:27.529 --> 01:29:32.834 region:rollup2
IT.

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:34.803 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE NOT AND YOU GO TO HR

01:29:32.834 --> 01:29:37.305 region:rollup2
HERE'S A SCRIPT FOR WHAT TO SAY

01:29:34.803 --> 01:29:39.908 region:rollup2
OR NOT SAY SO THAT'S ANOTHER

01:29:37.305 --> 01:29:43.345 region:rollup2
MICRO LEARNING LESSON IS A WAY.

01:29:39.908 --> 01:29:47.415 region:rollup2
OF AGAIN JUST REINFORCING WHAT'S

01:29:43.345 --> 01:29:49.584 region:rollup2
BEEN DONE SO AT LEAST FROM OUR

01:29:47.415 --> 01:29:53.455 region:rollup2
VIEW THOUGH THEY HAVE TO BE.

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:56.057 region:rollup2
RELEVANT AND AGAIN ALL SORT OF

01:29:53.455 --> 01:29:58.393 region:rollup2
POINT TO NOT ONLY WORKPLACE

01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:58.894 region:rollup2
CULTURE BUT.

01:29:58.393 --> 01:30:07.035 region:rollup2
THESE FIVE LESSONS TO TO

01:29:58.894 --> 01:30:08.770 region:rollup2
COINCIDE WITH AND REALLY

01:30:07.035 --> 01:30:09.638 region:rollup2
REINFORCE THOSE THINGS. THAT WE

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:12.507 region:rollup2
THOUGHT IT WAS.

01:30:09.638 --> 01:30:13.775 region:rollup2
IT IT WAS BUT I WANT TO BE SURE.

01:30:12.507 --> 01:30:15.277 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS I SHARED WITH WITH

01:30:13.775 --> 01:30:16.811 region:rollup2
MADAM CHAIR AS I'M LISTENING TO

01:30:15.277 --> 01:30:19.547 region:rollup2
YOU AND HEARING.

01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:20.715 region:rollup2
ABOUT ABOUT FRAMING.

01:30:19.547 --> 01:30:22.217 region:rollup2
THAT YOU DON'T FRAME AS IF

01:30:20.715 --> 01:30:23.918 region:rollup2
YOU'RE COMING TO HEAR THAT YOU

01:30:22.217 --> 01:30:26.121 region:rollup2
KNOW TO LEARN THE LAW. AND

01:30:23.918 --> 01:30:26.922 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE KIND

01:30:26.121 --> 01:30:29.424 region:rollup2
OF.

01:30:26.922 --> 01:30:31.092 region:rollup2
.

01:30:29.424 --> 01:30:32.961 region:rollup2
ORGANICS THE WRONG WORD BUT BUT

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:35.530 region:rollup2
BOTH CAUCUSES IN BOTH HOUSES

01:30:32.961 --> 01:30:36.831 region:rollup2
HAVE. WEEKLY CAUCUSES.

01:30:35.530 --> 01:30:38.833 region:rollup2
IT'S A PART OF OUR CULTURE OUR

01:30:36.831 --> 01:30:40.068 region:rollup2
EXISTING CULTURE WHERE WE GO

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:41.503 region:rollup2
WITH MEMBERS TO RECEIVE

01:30:40.068 --> 01:30:41.936 region:rollup2
INFORMATION LEARN NEW

01:30:41.503 --> 01:30:43.972 region:rollup2
INFORMATION EXCHANGE

01:30:41.936 --> 01:30:45.707 region:rollup2
INFORMATION.

01:30:43.972 --> 01:30:47.275 region:rollup2
AND SO I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT THE

01:30:45.707 --> 01:30:49.444 region:rollup2
MICRO LEARNING PIECE WAS BECAUSE

01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:52.314 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. IN ADDITION

01:30:49.444 --> 01:30:54.949 region:rollup2
TO OUR ONCE A YEAR ARE MANDATED

01:30:52.314 --> 01:30:56.952 region:rollup2
WE CAN USE THESE EXISTING

01:30:54.949 --> 01:30:57.552 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES.

01:30:56.952 --> 01:30:58.954 region:rollup2
ONCE A MONTH ONCE EVERY OTHER

01:30:57.552 --> 01:31:00.889 region:rollup2
MONTH.

01:30:58.954 --> 01:31:02.791 region:rollup2
TWO HAVE THE MICRO LEARNING

01:31:00.889 --> 01:31:04.492 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE AROUND CULTURE.

01:31:02.791 --> 01:31:07.028 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S NOT A SEPARATE

01:31:04.492 --> 01:31:09.130 region:rollup2
SCHEDULE TIME WHERE WE.

01:31:07.028 --> 01:31:10.765 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT IF CAUCUSES ON

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:12.901 region:rollup2
EVERYONE'S CALENDAR IN BOTH

01:31:10.765 --> 01:31:15.603 region:rollup2
HOUSES EVERY WEEK.

01:31:12.901 --> 01:31:17.505 region:rollup2
AND SO FIGURED OUT WAYS IN WHICH

01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:21.543 region:rollup2
WE CAN INTEGRATE.

01:31:17.505 --> 01:31:23.011 region:rollup2
LEARNING. NEW WAYS OF THINKING

01:31:21.543 --> 01:31:24.879 region:rollup2
INTO OUR EXISTING KIND OF

01:31:23.011 --> 01:31:26.681 region:rollup2
PATTERN AND PRACTICE.

01:31:24.879 --> 01:31:27.983 region:rollup2
MAY BE HELPFUL SLEPT WELL AND

01:31:26.681 --> 01:31:29.617 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT WHAT

01:31:27.983 --> 01:31:31.052 region:rollup2
MICHAEL LEARNING WHAT TO SEE IF

01:31:29.617 --> 01:31:33.154 region:rollup2
THAT MADE SENSE AND IF I COULD

01:31:31.052 --> 01:31:34.122 region:rollup2
JUST ADD ONE THING BECAUSE I

01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:34.889 region:rollup2
THINK THAT'S A FABULOUS IDEA.

01:31:34.122 --> 01:31:36.391 region:rollup2
ANOTHER.

01:31:34.889 --> 01:31:37.125 region:rollup2
VERY PRACTICAL WAY IN WHICH I

01:31:36.391 --> 01:31:39.227 region:rollup2
FOUND.

01:31:37.125 --> 01:31:40.362 region:rollup2
THIS THIS WORKS WELL AND I

01:31:39.227 --> 01:31:42.697 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY INCORPORATED INTO MY

01:31:40.362 --> 01:31:44.566 region:rollup2
MY TRAINING IS USING EITHER REAL

01:31:42.697 --> 01:31:45.800 region:rollup2
LIFE EXAMPLES OR IN MY CASE I

01:31:44.566 --> 01:31:46.568 region:rollup2
CAN USE REAL LIFE EXAMPLES

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:48.036 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I'VE DONE SO MANY

01:31:46.568 --> 01:31:49.671 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS AND NO ONE KNOWS

01:31:48.036 --> 01:31:50.839 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY'RE FROM. BUT I'LL

01:31:49.671 --> 01:31:52.741 region:rollup2
GIVE YOU REALLY QUICK ONE I HAVE

01:31:50.839 --> 01:31:54.943 region:rollup2
A AN INVESTIGATION I CONDUCTED

01:31:52.741 --> 01:31:55.710 region:rollup2
WHERE A SUPERVISOR SAID TO HIS

01:31:54.943 --> 01:31:58.246 region:rollup2
YOUNG AS.

01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:59.647 region:rollup2
ASSISTANT HEY MY FLIES OPEN

01:31:58.246 --> 01:32:00.949 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU TELL ME MY FLY WAS OPEN

01:31:59.647 --> 01:32:03.351 region:rollup2
HE SAID IT TWICE.

01:32:00.949 --> 01:32:04.386 region:rollup2
I STOPPED THERE AND I GET A

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:05.520 region:rollup2
WILL SAY TO THE PEOPLE ON TRAIN

01:32:04.386 --> 01:32:06.855 region:rollup2
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT. AND

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:08.256 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING

01:32:06.855 --> 01:32:09.758 region:rollup2
THINGS IS IT REALLY STARTS A

01:32:08.256 --> 01:32:11.259 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION WHICH IS REALLY THE

01:32:09.758 --> 01:32:12.494 region:rollup2
MAIN POINT I WANT TO MAKE ABOUT

01:32:11.259 --> 01:32:13.628 region:rollup2
THIS MICRO LEARNING LESSON IS IT

01:32:12.494 --> 01:32:14.229 region:rollup2
STARTS PEOPLE IN A VERY

01:32:13.628 --> 01:32:15.764 region:rollup2
COMFORTABLE WAY TALKING ABOUT

01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:16.998 region:rollup2
IT.

01:32:15.764 --> 01:32:17.899 region:rollup2
PEERS Y. THIS PARTICULAR

01:32:16.998 --> 01:32:19.367 region:rollup2
HYPOTHETIC OR NOT HYPOTHETICAL

01:32:17.899 --> 01:32:20.335 region:rollup2
FACT PATTERN IS IS REALLY

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:23.004 region:rollup2
INTERESTING.

01:32:20.335 --> 01:32:24.406 region:rollup2
WHAT I SAY I STOP THERE AND GET

01:32:23.004 --> 01:32:26.241 region:rollup2
MORE FACTS AND I SAY WHAT DO YOU

01:32:24.406 --> 01:32:28.009 region:rollup2
GUYS THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE

01:32:26.241 --> 01:32:31.513 region:rollup2
CONDUCT IS THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE

01:32:28.009 --> 01:32:31.813 region:rollup2
RISING TO UP MORE THAN JUST AN

01:32:31.513 --> 01:32:31.946 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE?

01:32:31.813 --> 01:32:33.014 region:rollup2
%

01:32:31.946 --> 01:32:34.349 region:rollup2
IT'S PRETTY UNIVERSAL THAT WOMEN

01:32:33.014 --> 01:32:35.016 region:rollup2
WILL SAY TO ME THAT'S GROSS AND

01:32:34.349 --> 01:32:35.683 region:rollup2
I DON'T WANT MY BOSS TELLING ME

01:32:35.016 --> 01:32:36.284 region:rollup2
TO YOU KNOW LOOK AT THAT PART OF

01:32:35.683 --> 01:32:37.519 region:rollup2
HIS BODY. AND I'VE HAD A SMALL

01:32:36.284 --> 01:32:38.686 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE BUT A PERCENTAGE OF

01:32:37.519 --> 01:32:39.554 region:rollup2
MEN WHO WILL SAY TO ME WELL

01:32:38.686 --> 01:32:41.656 region:rollup2
BEFORE I CAN TELL YOU IT'S

01:32:39.554 --> 01:32:42.257 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE OR NOT. I NEED TO

01:32:41.656 --> 01:32:42.690 region:rollup2
KNOW IF HIS FLIGHT WAS REALLY

01:32:42.257 --> 01:32:45.126 region:rollup2
DOWN.

01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:47.028 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF IT WASN'T DOWN THEN

01:32:45.126 --> 01:32:48.696 region:rollup2
HE'S A CREEP BUT IT WAS DOWN

01:32:47.028 --> 01:32:50.065 region:rollup2
THEN MAYBE WAS JUST LEGITIMATELY

01:32:48.696 --> 01:32:52.233 region:rollup2
TRYING TO I'VE NEVER HAD A WOMAN

01:32:50.065 --> 01:32:54.035 region:rollup2
SAY THAT TO ME. SO I USE THIS

01:32:52.233 --> 01:32:55.703 region:rollup2
HYPOTHETICAL ON WHERE THE STOCK

01:32:54.035 --> 01:32:57.939 region:rollup2
PATTERN ON PURPOSE TO REALLY

01:32:55.703 --> 01:32:59.507 region:rollup2
START HIGHLIGHTING THAT YOU KNOW

01:32:57.939 --> 01:33:01.476 region:rollup2
WE SEE THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY.

01:32:59.507 --> 01:33:04.612 region:rollup2
AND SO IT IT REALLY.

01:33:01.476 --> 01:33:07.415 region:rollup2
NOW IS A ROBUST AND HONEST

01:33:04.612 --> 01:33:08.349 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION AGAIN NOT BLAMING NOT

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:09.918 region:rollup2
SAYING YOU'RE A BAD GUY YOU'RE A

01:33:08.349 --> 01:33:11.653 region:rollup2
GOOD GUY BUT STARTING THIS

01:33:09.918 --> 01:33:13.188 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION I THEN MOVE ON TO

01:33:11.653 --> 01:33:15.323 region:rollup2
GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE FACTS AND

01:33:13.188 --> 01:33:17.258 region:rollup2
WITHOUT. GOING INTO THE INTO IT

01:33:15.323 --> 01:33:18.560 region:rollup2
TOO DEEPLY IT TURNS OUT THAT THE

01:33:17.258 --> 01:33:21.229 region:rollup2
THE GENTLEMAN WHO ENGAGE IN THE

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:22.564 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR WAS ABOUT THIRTY YEARS

01:33:21.229 --> 01:33:24.566 region:rollup2
OLDER THAN THE YOUNG LADY AND

01:33:22.564 --> 01:33:26.134 region:rollup2
TALKED CONSTANTLY. ABOUT HOW HIS

01:33:24.566 --> 01:33:28.269 region:rollup2
PREFERRED DEMOGRAPHIC WAS

01:33:26.134 --> 01:33:29.804 region:rollup2
EXACTLY THIS YOUNG LADY AND SO

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:31.206 region:rollup2
IT PUTS THINGS IN CONTEXT NOW

01:33:29.804 --> 01:33:33.675 region:rollup2
SUDDENLY IT'S NOT JUST HIM

01:33:31.206 --> 01:33:34.709 region:rollup2
SAYING OF MY FLY OPEN. IT IS HER

01:33:33.675 --> 01:33:35.777 region:rollup2
SAYING.

01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:36.845 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S HITTING ON

01:33:35.777 --> 01:33:37.846 region:rollup2
ME BUT I SURE KNOW THAT OUR

01:33:36.845 --> 01:33:39.414 region:rollup2
PHONE TWO WAS DEMOGRAPHIC

01:33:37.846 --> 01:33:41.349 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU KNOW HE TALKS ALL

01:33:39.414 --> 01:33:42.951 region:rollup2
THE TIME NOT ABOUT SEX. BUT

01:33:41.349 --> 01:33:44.052 region:rollup2
ABOUT LIKING WOMEN MY AGE SO

01:33:42.951 --> 01:33:46.087 region:rollup2
MAYBE MAYBE HE'S OUT THERE

01:33:44.052 --> 01:33:47.188 region:rollup2
FISHING FOR IT. AND NOW SUDDENLY

01:33:46.087 --> 01:33:49.023 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE IN THE TRAINING

01:33:47.188 --> 01:33:49.657 region:rollup2
SESSION OR LIKE ALL THAT'S ALL

01:33:49.023 --> 01:33:51.693 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ONCE YOU PUT IT INTO

01:33:49.657 --> 01:33:53.294 region:rollup2
CONTEXT SO THAT'S ANOTHER

01:33:51.693 --> 01:33:54.929 region:rollup2
MICHAEL LEARNING LESSON IT'S A

01:33:53.294 --> 01:33:56.431 region:rollup2
TEN MINUTE CONVERSATION. BUT IT

01:33:54.929 --> 01:33:59.067 region:rollup2
OPENS UP A DISCUSSION THAT

01:33:56.431 --> 01:33:59.667 region:rollup2
REALLY IN A WAY THAT'S NOT

01:33:59.067 --> 01:34:00.902 region:rollup2
BLAMING IN A WAY THAT'S NOT.

01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:02.370 region:rollup2
DEFENSIVE.

01:34:00.902 --> 01:34:03.872 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WALK OUT OF THERE SAYING

01:34:02.370 --> 01:34:05.306 region:rollup2
HE I GUESS MAYBE I SEE THE WORLD

01:34:03.872 --> 01:34:07.575 region:rollup2
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY AND

01:34:05.306 --> 01:34:09.110 region:rollup2
CONTEXT REALLY MATTERS.

01:34:07.575 --> 01:34:10.411 region:rollup2
AND IT DOES MATTER AND AND THE

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:12.514 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES YOU'VE GIVEN LET US

01:34:10.411 --> 01:34:14.916 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT SO MUCH OF OUR LIVES

01:34:12.514 --> 01:34:17.785 region:rollup2
ARE IN THE GRAY AREA. AS OPPOSED

01:34:14.916 --> 01:34:18.987 region:rollup2
TO THE REALLY KIND OF SIMPLISTIC

01:34:17.785 --> 01:34:20.522 region:rollup2
CAN I FILL GIVE COPS.

01:34:18.987 --> 01:34:22.190 region:rollup2
DOUBLE THE COMPLIMENTS WERE

01:34:20.522 --> 01:34:23.858 region:rollup2
PERFECT BECAUSE THEY'RE VERY

01:34:22.190 --> 01:34:25.560 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT

01:34:23.858 --> 01:34:26.728 region:rollup2
AS MY FATHER WOULD SAY STEVIE

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.262 region:rollup2
WONDER COULD SEE THE DIFFERENCE

01:34:26.728 --> 01:34:30.365 region:rollup2
IN THOSE TO HOW THEY WERE

01:34:27.262 --> 01:34:30.365 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

01:34:30.431 --> 01:34:33.334 region:rollup2
FOR ME MADAM CHAIR.

01:34:31.733 --> 01:34:35.036 region:rollup2
IN THE HANDOUT YOU SHARE WITH US

01:34:33.334 --> 01:34:37.972 region:rollup2

ACCEPTABLE SO IF WE HAVE DONE AN

01:35:57.518 --> 01:36:00.221 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATION OR EVEN IF WE'VE

01:35:59.087 --> 01:36:01.956 region:rollup2
JUST HAD THAT INITIAL

01:36:00.221 --> 01:36:02.357 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION SAYING LOOK YOUR

YOUR COMMENTS WERE

01:36:02.357 --> 01:36:04.292 region:rollup2
INAPPROPRIATE.

01:36:03.791 --> 01:36:05.760 region:rollup2

01:36:10.865 --> 01:36:15.103 region:rollup2
AREA AND NOW HARASS THE PERSON

01:36:13.368 --> 01:36:16.371 region:rollup2
WHO JUST REPORTED THIS.

01:36:15.103 --> 01:36:17.939 region:rollup2
NO BECAUSE THEY FELT

01:36:16.371 --> 01:36:19.507 region:rollup2
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH YOUR WORDS.

01:36:17.939 --> 01:36:20.575 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE DOCUMENT SO IT'S

01:36:19.507 --> 01:36:22.744 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE A

01:36:20.575 --> 01:36:24.712 region:rollup2
RECORD OF THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW

01:36:22.744 --> 01:36:26.114 region:rollup2

THESE THINGS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME

01:36:26.114 --> 01:36:30.351 region:rollup2
AND IF THEY'RE NOT DOCUMENTED

01:36:27.715 --> 01:36:32.020 region:rollup2
IT'S YOUR WORD AGAINST THEIRS.

01:36:30.351 --> 01:36:33.054 region:rollup2

POINT OF SAYING IF MY EMPLOYEE

THIS IS WHAT I HAVE SEEN AND I

01:37:57.305 --> 01:37:58.673 region:rollup2
THINK THERE DEFINITELY IS A

01:37:57.872 --> 01:38:00.308 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:37:58.673 --> 01:38:01.809 region:rollup2
ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE HELPFUL

01:38:00.308 --> 01:38:03.177 region:rollup2

WE WANT THAT DOCUMENTATION

01:38:11.519 --> 01:38:15.022 region:rollup2
MOSTLY BECAUSE PEOPLE'S MEMORIES

DO INVESTIGATIONS. THEY'RE NOT
