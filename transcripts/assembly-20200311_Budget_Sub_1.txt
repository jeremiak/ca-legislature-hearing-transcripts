SOMEONE HEARING ON MARCH ELEVENTH OF TWENTY TWENTY TODAY WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THE AGING AREA AND THE PROGRAMS FOR SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. THIS IS A PROMISING TIME FOR CALIFORNIA AS THE GOVERNOR HAS TAKEN EXTRAORDINARY STEPS LAST YEAR TO BEGIN A MASTER PLAN OF AGING PROCESS WHICH HAS BEEN VERY OPEN DELIBERATIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE. WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE WHERE THIS WILL LEAD AND WHAT CALIFORNIA CAN DO TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND SERVICES FOR CALIFORNIA'S AGING POPULATION. WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A DIRECT NEXUS BETWEEN THE FORCES OF A THE HIGH COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA AND BEAT HOW ARE PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICES WORK TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXTREMELY LOW INCOME AND IN NEED. AND SEE THE DISK THE DISGRACE OF RACING HOUSING INSTABILITY AND STREET HOMELESSNESS AFFECTING ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE CAN PURSUE IMPROVEMENTS AND INVESTMENTS THAT FORTIFY THE SAFETY NET COUNTERACTS INCREASING HOMELESSNESS AND TO PREVENT THE CRISES FROM SPENDING EVEN FURTHER. BURGEONING HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS WITH SENIORS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND CHILDREN IS UNACCEPTABLE IN THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. AND UNDER OUR COLLECTIVE MORAL LEADERSHIP. THE PROGRAMS WE WILL DISCUSS TODAY THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES SS I SS P. AND THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES ARE PART OF OUR FRONTLINE DEFENSES AGAINST SENIOR POVERTY AND POVERTY AT LARGE IN OUR STATE. TODAY IT WILL HEAR MANY ADVOCACY PROPOSALS THAT SHARE THE THEME OF FORTIFYING THE SAFETY NET I'D LIKE TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TO PLEASE BE PREPARED TO OFFER TECHNICAL AND SUBSTANTIVE FEEDBACK TO AID US AS WE WILL ALL TOGETHER CONSIDER THESE INVESTMENTS. IN THE ENTRANCE OF STRENGTHENING THE PUBLIC SOCIAL SERVICE APPROACH TO COMBATING HOMELESSNESS. HUMAN SERVICE INVESTMENTS ARE ABSOLUTELY PART OF THE ANSWER. IF THE INVESTMENTS ARE GENUINE AND GENEROUS. I HOPE WE CAN PLACE OUR COLLECTIVE INTENTION IN THAT DIRECTION AS WE HEAR ABOUT WAYS TO BUILD UPON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO INVITE OUR FIRST PANEL TO PLEASE COME TO THE WITNESS TABLE FOR ISSUE ONE THE UPDATE ON THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING AND THE LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS SUBCOMMITTEE REPORT.

OF REASONS AS WE AGE. IN ORDER TO LIVE. MANY MAY YEARS A AGING SIXTY SEVENTY A NINETY. ALL LOOKS DIFFERENT FOR OURSELVES AND OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES. SO WE'RE LEARNING A LOT WE'RE HEARING ABOUT PRIORITY TOPICS GOD NO SURPRISE HERE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS ARE AMONG THE TOP PRIORITY.

GREAT THANK YOU- NEXT WE HAVE THE SKIN FOUNDATION. IT'S INTRODUCED HERSELF AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY MY NAME IS SERRA STEEN HAUSEN I'M SENIOR POLICY ADVISER WITH THE SCAN FOUNDATION AND I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORT SUBCOMMITTEE I'M GOING TO PROVIDE A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE L. TSS SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS AND OF THE REPORT. THE OUT THE SUBCOMMITTEE IS REPRESENTED BY A VERY DIVERSE GROUP OF CONSUMERS L. TSS PROVIDERS ADVOCATES IN CARE GIVERS. AND OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS WE'VE BEEN TASKED WITH DEVELOPING A ROOF REPORT THAT REFLECTS THE VIEWS OF THE SUB COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND EXAMINES THE CHALLENGES WHILE IDENTIFYING THE POLICY OPPORTUNITIES RELATIVE TO OUR STATES L. TSS SYSTEM. THROUGH THIS PROCESS THE SUB COMMITTEE EXAMINED HOW THE SYSTEM IS AND ISN'T WORKING FOR OLDER ADULTS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES CARE GIVERS AND FAMILIES AND HOW WE MIGHT BUILD A STRONG FOUNDATION PURPOSE FOR A PERSON CENTERED SYSTEM OF CARE THAT ENSURES THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN LIVE WHERE THEY CHOOSE AND WITH THE NECESSARY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THEY NEED. IN SO DOING ALL OF THAT THE REPORT IDENTIFIES FIVE KEY OBJECTIVES. THE FIRST OBJECTIVES AND ALL OF THESE CAN BE FOUND ON PAGE TWELVE TO THIRTEEN OF YOUR AGENDA- THE FIRST OBJECTIVE IS A SYSTEM THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS CAN EASILY NAVIGATE. THE SECOND OBJECTIVE IS ACCESS TO L. T. S. AS IN EVERY COMMUNITY. THE THIRD OBJECTIVE IS AFFORDABILITY AND AFFORDABLE L. TSS CHOICES WITH A FUNDING STREAM THAT ENSURES THOSE CHOICES ARE MATT. FOURTH A HIGHLY VALUED AND HIGH QUALITY WORK FORCE. AND THE FIFTH OBJECTIVE IS STREAMLINED STATE AND LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURES. THE SUBCOMMITTEE FEELS THAT THESE FIVE OBJECTIVES ARE ALL CRITICAL TO MEETING THE POPULATIONS L. TSS NEEDS SO EACH OBJECTIVE IS INTERDEPENDENT AND NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE STATE'S VISION. THE REPORT PROVIDES A BROAD TEN YOUR VISION FOR L. TSS IN CALIFORNIA WHILE MAKING CONCUR CONCRETE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW TO MOVE FORWARD WITH TO LOOK TO THAT VISION. AND WHILE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS REPRESENT LONGER START TERM STRATEGIES- OTHERS CAN BE ACTED UPON IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE. SO RECOGNIZING THE M. URGENCY FOR ACTION AND THE NEED TO START ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES NOW THE SUBCOMMITTEE EIGHT IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE RIGHT FOR ACTION. AND SYSTEM WIDE INVESTMENTS WHICH WE HOPE THE LEGISLATURE AND ADMINISTRATION WILL CONSIDER FOR THIS YEAR. THANK YOU I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.

JEFF HARDY KIA- ADVOCATE- KERA OWL OTHER ISSUES THROUGH HERE AS I SAID AT THE FIRST MEETING AND ARE YOU JUST MISSED THE LAST MASTER PLAN MEETING- THROUGH THE IN MAINTAINING A WATCHING THESE THINGS THE THING I WILL OFFER TO YOU IS THIS IS IT'S WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT YOU NEED TO KNOW AND WITH A LESS THAN BASICALLY HAPPEN MILLION SENIORS. THAT ARE YOU USING SERVICES WHEN YOU HAVE MORE THAN TWO OR THREE YOU HAVE NO TEN MILLION THAT YOU'RE LIKELY TO EXPECT WITHIN TEN YEARS- YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE OTHER THINGS CLIMATE AND OTHER INVOLVEMENTS- THINGS THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED WITH THESE PEOPLE THIRTY FIVE PEOPLE IN THE OTHERS HAVE DONE IS LIKE A SURGEON AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS THEY CAN RECOMMEND YOU DO THE THINGS THAT THEY KNOW. BUT IF YOU'VE TALKED TO A CONSUMER THEY WILL TELL YOU THE TINGS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHY CALL HAVING TO RELOCATE BECAUSE OF HOUSING COSTS TO GET CARE GIVERS AND OTHER THINGS TO HELP THEM OUT BECAUSE THEY CAN NO LONGER LIVE IN THE SITUATION CURRENT LIVING. AND GET THE SERVICES THAT THEY- MUCH LESS WHAT TEMPERATURE GO. FIVE OR TEN DEGREES. THE OTHER FACTORS THAT WILL INVERSELY IMPACT SENIORS. THANK YOU SIR.

AND THEN WE GOT TO DO THE HARD WORK OF ACTUALLY GETTING THEM FUNDED AND ENACTED- BUT I WAS ASKED BY SOME A SENIOR'S GROUP THAT DIDN'T WANT TO SEND FOLKS HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF THE COLOR RED- IT. SITUATION I WAS ASKED TO SHARE STORIES BUT I'M JUST GONNA PICK ONE- THIS IS ISABEL FROM BOULDER CREEK CALIFORNIA WHO IS A FAMILY CARE GIVER FOR HER FATHER. MY LOVE IS MY GARDEN BUT I DON'T SPEND MUCH TIME THERE THESE DAYS SAYS ISABEL WHO HAS BEEN THE MAIN PERSON PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR HER FATHER JACK. DIAGNOSED WITH ALZHEIMER'S FOUR YEARS AGO. ISABEL COOKS CLEANS TRACKS FINANCES DRIVES IN A COMPANIES JACK TO MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS. JACK'S MIDDLE CLASS SAVINGS ARE ALL BUT DEPLETED BY MEDICAL COSTS TO THE POINT WHERE HE NOW QUALIFIES FOR MEDI CAL AND I JUST US. IN SPITE OF THIS SUPPORT ISABEL AND HER TWO SIBLINGS ARE STILL CONTRIBUTING ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED A MONTH EACH TO HELP COVER JACK'S HOUSE PAYMENTS FOOD MEDICINE AND OTHER COSTS. BEING HIS PRIMARY CARE MANAGER ISABEL HAS LOST HER FULL TIME JOB AND IS NOW TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW SHE'S GOING TO SAVE FOR HER OWN RETIREMENT. WITHOUT THE INCREASE WITH THE INCREASED COST CARING FOR HER FATHER ISABEL SHARES MY HUSBAND SAYS I WORRY ABOUT YOU ISABEL BECAUSE HE SEES HOW MUCH TIME. I PUT INTO CARING FOR MY FATHER AND HOW LITTLE TIME I GIVE TO MYSELF. A UNIVERSAL LONG TERM CARE SOCIAL INSURANCE PROGRAM WOULD HELP COVER JACK'S DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND FREE IS A BILL UP.

WE CAN START DOING SOME OF THIS NOW AND WE WOULD URGE YOU TO HAVE CONSIDERATION OF THOSE. THANK YOU SIR. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS HAVE ANYONE WITH THAT THE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA. I'M REALLY APPRECIATE THE ROBUST AND ENGAGE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS- DEFINITELY ONE LIKE TO THINK THE DIRECTOR FOR ALL YOUR LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS YOU MISTER CHAIR AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED WORKING WITH YOU OFF. THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. HELLO MY NAME IS ROBERT COLLIDE LONG TO THAT DOCTOR. THIS BILL IF YOU'RE RIGHTS GROUP HERE IN SACRAMENTO AND THE POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN WITH MORE NATIONAL GROUP. YOU CAN HAVE THE BEST PLAN THE WORLD. BUT IF YOU DON'T PROPERLY FUND THAT WOULD COULD. BURN THE PROGRAM THEN THE FUNDING THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE SUB COMMITTEE TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I'M I'M A START IF I CAN WITH YOU DIRECTOR MCCOY WADE- JUST GENERALLY WHAT KINDS OF SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS ARE RISING AS A HIGHER PRIORITY. GIVEN THAT THERE ARE PRESSURES WITHIN THE AGING COMMUNITY AND OUR DEMOGRAPHIC PROJECTIONS. THE BOOK THANK YOU ARE THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. BUT YOU KNOW AGAIN- WHAT ONE OF OUR RULES OF DATING APARTMENTS TO BE THAT PERSON CENTERED FOCUS ACROSS MULTIPLE SYSTEMS SO IS CLEARLY THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR- UP ALL OF US AS WE AGE WHICH ARE AT HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND SOCIAL SERVICES AN AGING. OF THE NEED FOR MORE PERSON CENTERED CARE SO THAT THOSE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE EVERY COUNTY AND THEY'RE AFFORDABLE- IS CLEARLY. IN PART BECAUSE THIS REPORT WAS DUE FIRST HAS COME UP LOUD AND CLEAR BUT IN PART BECAUSE IT'S A REAL CRISIS WE HEAR IT EVERY FORUM OF PEOPLE WITH A TERRIBLE CHOICES IN TERRIBLE OUTCOMES AND SO THAT NO DOUBT I'D SAY ON THE THREE OTHER ONES THAT ARE. VERY STRIKING OR AGAIN THE VIEW CYNICAL ACT- BOTH IN TERMS OF THE FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION OFTEN- FAMILY OFTEN ONLINE OFTEN HOME IMPROVEMENT AND THEN AGAIN I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THIS TERM OF SELF NEGLECT BECAUSE IT REALLY IS THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE PERSON'S HARMING THEMSELVES WHEN IN FACT WHAT IT IS A LACK OF RESOURCES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RESOURCES FINANCIAL RESOURCES. SO THOSE ARE VERY CONCERNING TO ME THOSE URGENT CASES- WERE ALWAYS KEEPING OUR MIND ON EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE FOR ACCESSAND FUNCTIONAL NEEDS WHETHER ITS FIRES EARTHQUAKES POWERSHOT OFFICE I'M WORKING WITH YES THERE'S MORE WE NEED TO DO TO HELP US ALL PREPARED- YOU KNOW IMAGINING HAVING TO GO THROUGH THE ACTIVATION ORDER WHEN YOU NO LONGER CAN DRIVE WHAT IS A REAL PLAN FOR THAT AND GIVEN THE RISK OF FIDELITY IS WITH OLDER ADULTS. AND THEN I THINK WE'RE ALL WRESTLING WITH THIS NOTION OF WHAT YOU CALL ISOLATION OR AGEISM. BUT THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOT FULLY MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITIES AS WE AGE AND WE ARE EXCLUDED FROM WORK OR FROM PUBLIC SPACES ARE LEADS TO ALL KINDS OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. IMPACT AND SO. RANGING FROM THE PRESS ALL THROUGH TO. RISING SO. RATES AMONG OLDER ADULTS. AND SO WHEN YOU THOSE ARE ALL. PERSON CENTERED- CRISES THAT REQUIRE ALL OF US TO COME TOGETHER IN NEW WAYS SO WE HAVE NEW EFFORTS ON L. TSS WE HAVE NEW BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TASK FORCE WE HAVE. BETTER THAN EVER EMERGENCY COORDINATION. I'LL BUT CLEARLY THERE'S MORE TO DO SO ALL OF THOSE POINTS. AND THEN AND I WOULD JUST A CROSS CUTTING. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE INCREASING COGNITIVE ISSUES IS STRAINING ALL OF OUR SYSTEMS. THE NONE OF OUR SYSTEMS WELL WE'RE REALLY BUILT FOR HIGH NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA IS AND COGNITIVE HEALTH. AND SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO- HAVE THE SPACES IN THE PLACES ON THE WORK FORCE AND THE CARE GIVING AND THE AND THE MONEY. TO CARE FOR ALL OF US AS WE AGE AND EXPERIENCE- AND OF COURSE pWELL. BUT I THINK THOSE ARE SOME OF THE MOST- HEARTBREAKING AN URGENT ISSUES THAT I HEAR WHEN I'M AROUND THE STATE- DIRECTOR MCCOY WAY DO YOU SEE ANY CHANGES TO AYE HSS WITH THE MASTER PLAN. UPDATE WELL I WOULD CERTAINLY DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES AT CDS OUT TO RUN THAT PROGRAM AND CONDUCTED. A REALLY WONDERFUL SO ASSET OF LISTENING SESSIONS AROUND THE STATE AND HEARD LOTS AND LOTS OF. YOU KNOW STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS CROWN JEWEL OF OUR HOME CAN BE BASED SERVICES- AND THEN ALSO SOME OF THE SAME PRESSURES PRESSURES ON THE WORK FORCE. PRESSURES ON THE CHANGING% POPULATION- YOU KNOW I THINK WAS SO INTERESTING THAT WHAT SESSIONS WITH A NUMBER THE GROWTH OF CHILDREN. I TEST PROGRAM. PROGRAM HAS BECOME. TO SUCH PERSON. PEOPLE THAT WAS DEFINITELY HOW TOPIC IN A- AM GLAD I JUST IS ON THE IN THE LATER FOR CDS US. ADDRESS WELL I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO. THANK pOF OUR SENIORS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS AS THAT WILL. ALSO HAVE AN EFFECT WITHIN OUR HSS POPULATIONS AND- ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO HAVE SACRIFICED FOR MANY OF OUR SUCCESSES WILL HAVE. AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE CARED FOR AS WELL WHERE THEY STAND SO- WITH THAT IF I CAN FOR- SERRA. SERRA PLEASE. ANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OR OBJECTIONS WITHIN YOUR L. TSS REPORT WHICH NEED TO BE FAST TRACKED- GIVEN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM GAPS. SO I WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE GIVEN A LOT OF THOUGHT ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE ABOUT HOW THEY NEED TO REALLY LOOK ACROSS THE FIVE OBJECTIVES AND- ADDRESS THE PRIORITIES AND THE MORE THE IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS WITH IN EACH OF THOSE SO. MORE SPECIFICALLY THERE IS A CHART HERE THIRTY SEVEN IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS THAT CAN BE ACTED ON AND- I WOULD SAY THAT THERE'S REALLY NOT A LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE THAT HAS BEEN SUCH A SIGN TO EACH BUT THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES IS RIGHT NOW PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO GET THE INFORMATION THEY NEED TO MAKE DECISIONS. THAT'S WHAT THE ISSUE BUT ONE IF THEY HAVE THE RIGHT INFORMATION THEY CAN'T ACCESS THE SUPPORTS THEY NEED SO WE HAVE MANY AREAS IN THE STATE WE A LACK OF SERVICES. SO PEOPLE CAN'T EVEN GET WHAT THEY NEED IF THEY HAVE THE RIGHT INFORMATION BUT THEN THIRD AS HAS BEEN DISCUSSED AS PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO. THERE RUSHED AND IF WE ARE FOURTH WE A TRUE WORK FORCE CHALLENGE WITH THE WE FOCUSED ON THE DIRECT CARE WORK FORCE SO WAYS TO INCREASE THE LABOR SUPPLY AND HOT WITH HIGH QUALITY JOBS BUT THEN ALSO IMPORTANTLY I'M KIND OF OVER ARCHING ALL THIS IS THE NEED FOR LEADERSHIP AND THAT ALIGNS WITH KIND OF LOOKING AT BETTER WAYS TO STREAMLINE AT THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVEL- AND A LOT OF WITH THOSE CATEGORIES THERE ARE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAN BE ACTED ON NOW EITHER THROUGH THE BUDGET OR THROUGH LEGISLATION. OR THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE ACTION. SO WELL TO. ANY OF THOSE WITH YOU AND- AS YOU NEED- I BELIEVE WE WILL FOLLOW UP SPECIFICALLY AS THEY REGARD TO THE BUDGET AND I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO HEAR A NUMBER OF THE PROPOSALS LATER TODAY AND SO. INPUT YOU CAN GIVE FORM WHAT IS LIMITED RESOURCES ALLOWS US TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP WONDERFUL- AGAIN NO IT'S NICE HAVING A NEW DIRECTOR AND AN ADMINISTRATION THAT'S LEANING AND ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE- AND REALLY WAS. FINE THIS AS A VERY HELPFUL UPDATE- AS IT OFFERS US AN IMPORTANT CONTEXT. AS WE HEAR WHAT IS THE BALANCE OF THE AGENDA FOR THE REMAINDER OF TODAY. I DO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION THE PLEASE KEEP US ABREAST AND INCLUDED. AS WE PROGRESS AND MOVE FORWARD OR TALKED OVER FOR. REPORT HAS. CHANGED OUR- ALMOST DAILY NOW WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT OF AGING SO. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE WILL OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TOO AT THAT SEE PROPOSALS. AND I MATH THE SERGEANTS THE CALLED MEMBERS TO. I'M ARE PRESENT PLEASE PROPOSALS.

LETTERS BY EIGHTY ARE SEIZE YES OKAY GREAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS- EIGHTY RC MODEL IS SOMETHING I'VE CHAMPION AND IS ONE OF THE PRIORITIES RECOMMENDED IN THE DRAFT MASTER PLAN FOR AGING ADR SEES ALLOW OLDER CALIFORNIANS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ACCESS TO SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THEY NEED WHEN NEEDED- THIS FUNDING ALLOW SKI WHITE EXPANSION OF THE E. D. R. C. PROGRAM GETTING TIMELY AND ACCURATE INFORMATION IS CRITICAL TO. AVOIDING COSTLY INSTITUTIONAL CARE THIS FUNDING ALLOWS THE EXPANSION OF THE EIGHT YEARS HE TO ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES- THE REQUEST PROVIDES FOR A THREE PHASE AND WITH ME IS CLAY C&lt;c.cyan&gt; SECULAR&lt;/c&gt; DIRECTOR OF SENIOR. A CASTLE OF SANTA CRUZ AND SAN BENITO COUNTIES. SIR JUST A INTO THAT- I ALSO THANKS FOR LETTING ME BE HERE- IN ADDITION TO MY ROLE I'M ALSO- LEGISLATIVE CO CHAIR FOR CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF AREA AGENCIES ON AGING. AND A MEMBER OF THE- MASTER PLAN FOR AGING STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY. COMMITTEE SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SERRA STEAM HOUSING MENTIONED IN TERMS OF WHAT THAT LOW HANGING FRUIT AN IMMEDIATE ACTION IS. THIS IS ONE OF THEM. AND THE STORY I LIKE TO TELL ABOUT THIS IS YOU KNOW WE REALLY NEED A RIDE NO WRONG DOOR SYSTEM IN OUR STATE WE NEED A WAY FOR PEOPLE TO FIND WHERE TO GET SERVICES WHEN THEY NEED THEM IF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GET THE SERVICES THEY REALLY DON'T EXIST. SO THE GOAL BEHIND A. B. R. C.'S IS TO DO A NO WRONG DOOR APPROACH WHERE YOU TYPICALLY HAVE A DESIGNATED. MAIN ENTRANCE POINT BUT YOU PARTNER REALLY CLOSELY WITH THE KEY ORGANIZATIONS IN YOUR COMMUNITY SO EACH AND KNOW ABOUT EACH OTHER AND CAN DO EASY REFERRAL AND IMPROVE TOWARD. TREMENDOUS PLUS THE MOST IMPORTANT. SAID IN. MULTIPLE THIS IS INSURED PEOPLE SIR CAN. GET TO THEM. SO LAST YEAR WE HAD A BILL WHICH STARTED THIS PROCESS FOR CALIFORNIA AND RIGHT NOW AS A RESULT OF THAT WE HAVE SIX FULLY OPERATIONAL- A. B. R. C.'S IN OUR STATE AND THEN THERE'S TEN THAT ARE EMERGING OUR GOAL WITH THIS COMING REQUEST IS. AS STATED TO GET EIGHTY ARE SEIZE ALL AROUND THE STATE SO IT'S A THREE YEAR- PROCESS TO GET US UP TO THAT LEVEL- YOU CAN SEE THE NUMBERS ON HERE NINETEEN MILLION. THIRTY MILLION AND FIFTY ONE GOING TO GET THERE AND IF WE DON'T DO THIS WE JUST END UP STOP WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW SO WE'LL HAVE TEN ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE MERGING TO BE EIGHTY R. C.'S. BUT WITH FLAT FUNDING BILL NEVER BECOME FULLY OPERATIONAL OR THEY WILL BE UNDER FUNDED WHEN THEY'RE PERFORMING THAT ROLE SO WE'RE TRYING TO MOVE THOSE TAN INTO COMPLETE OPERATING AB R. SEES. AND THEN BRING ON ADDITIONAL AGENCIES EACH YEAR WITH THE PLAN TO HAVE THEM TRANSITION FROM NOT BEING ANY PLACE AND THEN HAVING YOU KNOW THE EMERGING STATUS AND THEN FOR THE- FUNDING ON. THESE PROGRAMS ARE I REGULATION PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS AND AREA AGENCIES ON AGING SO WE HAVE A REAL NICE PROSPER NURSE SHIP THERE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND OLDER ADULTS. AND I JUST THINK IT'S A MODEL PROGRAM AND HOPE YOU CAN SUPPORT. USER ARE DIRECTOR CALL WAY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA ON. JUST CHECK KNOWLEDGE EIGHTY C. IS A PROGRAM THAT CITY A WORKS ON MUCH VERY MUCH A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE TRIPLE A IS AN INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS AND ARE PREPARED BY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE ON SUCH AN EXPANSION. THANK YOU. PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE BE. MR CHECKER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WHERE SHE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSAL THANK YOU SIR MARTY MOTO FAMILY MEMBERS CITY CAN STRONG SUPPORT. THE JORDANS OF THE OUR COMMUNITY TO PROPOSE A CALIFORNIA COLLABORATION AND STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. PLEASE A COMMON WITH CAO CAO IN SUPPORT. HYSTERICAL AS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF AREA AGENCIES ON AGING OBVIOUSLY. VERY SUPPORTIVE THIS IS A MAN A PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE THAT SUPPORTIVE OF FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. THANK YOU SIR. CAROL SOURCE LETTER CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING IN SUPPORT THANK YOU MA'AM. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT TOM BRING IT UP TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR ANY COMMENTS THAT WE MAY HAVE- I DON'T SEE ANY NOW- I WILL JUST BRIEFLY ASK YOU IF I CAN THE LOGIC BETWEEN GOING FROM SIX TO FIFTY EIGHT OUR IS FIFTY EIGHT THE- APPROPRIATE NUMBER FOR US TO BE LOOKING AT IS THAT BASED OFF OF. THE NUMBER OF COUNTIES THAT WE HAVE HOW DID YOU DECIDE AND WHAT IS THE RIGHT NUMBER AND IT IS BASED OFF THE NUMBER OF COUNTIES WE HAVE AND PART OF THAT IS THE REALIZATION THAT INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE IN OPTIONS COUNSELING. IT'S A LOCAL KNOWLEDGE AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT CONSUMERS BE ABLE TO- GET HELP FROM A TRUSTED ENTITY ONE THE NOW AND THEN THE OTHER PART OF THAT. A LOCAL MAN CITY HAS MUCH BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THEIR COMMUNITY INCLUDING WHICH PROGRAMS ARE ACT TO PASS TO BE THAT IT'S KIND OF FEUDAL TO MAKE REFERRALS TO. I'M JUST OUT OF MY HAND CURIOSITY AND I CAN'T HELP MYSELF SOMETIMES BUT- DOES ONLINE WORK IS THERE AN ADVANTAGE TO. HAVING SOURCES FLOW THROUGH AN ONLINE PORTAL THAT COULD ALSO TOO SIMILAR FUNCTIONS. ONLINE IS CERTAINLY AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF IT BUT IT'S NOT ALL INCLUSIVE I ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IS THE INTERACTIVE DIALOGUE THAT A CONSUMER WILL HAVE WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S ASSESSING WHAT OPTIONS THEY HAVE- WHEN NEEDS THEY HAVE FOR CARE SO ONLINE GREAT RESOURCE BUT LACKS THAT INTERACTIVE COMPONENT AND OFTEN IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS WE FIND WHAT THE PERSON IS CALLING ABOUT. IS ONLY A VERY SMALL PORTION OF WHAT THEY REALLY NEED. GREAT WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE BE OPEN AND IF WE MAY ASSEMBLYMEMBER NECESSARY AND WE CAN MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ISSUED TO SEE EXTEND FALLS PREVENTION PROGRAM ALSO. ALSO A SPONSORED BY C. FOUR EIGHT. AT THE FUNDING PROVIDES FOR A COMMUNITY BASED INTERVENTION PROGRAM THAT ADDRESSES CRITICAL ISSUES OF SENIORS FALLING FUNDING ESTABLISHED IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET BECOMES ON GOING THROUGH THIS PROPOSAL- THE FUNDING ALLOWS THE PROGRAM TO BE EXPANDED TO ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES- THE PROGRAM IS BEING CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING. AND AGAIN CLAY KEMPF FOR MORE DETAILS. THIS ONE IS PRETTY SELF EXPLANATORY YOU KNOW I'M FALLS PREVENTION AS A AS A SIMPLE CONCEPT BUT DIFFICULT TO IMPLEMENT. SO IT'S BRAND NEW FOR US RIGHT NOW BUT WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT WE'VE GOT SOME NICE EMERGING PARTNERS FIRST RESPONDERS FOR EXAMPLE. OFTEN GO OUT ON CALLS IN FACT IN SOME FIRE DEPARTMENTS THE MAJORITY THEIR CALLS ARE TO PICK SOMEBODY UP WHO DOESN'T NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL. SO WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM TO FIND WHO THE FREQUENT FOLLOWERS ARE AND ASSESS WHAT'S GOING ON AN EXAMPLE OF A SIMPLE STE GEN. I'M YEARS AGO- WE USED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE GRAB BARS IN BATHROOMS HOME MODIFICATION- THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE AS PART OF A OUR USE OF FELT DOLLAR. THAT AN OLD PASSED. FEDERAL FUNDS CAN'T BE USED FOR THAT AT THIS TIME SO WE'RE HAVING TO YOU KNOW DEVELOP OTHER FUNDING SOURCES AND OTHER SYSTEMS AND THIS IS A PERFECT USE OF THAT AND- I THINK IT'S FAIRLY OBVIOUS HOW EFFECTIVE A GRAB BAR CAN BE IN JUST. A FALL IN HOSPITALS AND BROKE IT THE- THANK YOU. PARTMINER FINAL LA ANY COMMENTS A PUBLIC COMMEN ON TO SEE. ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SOCIETY AND MS IS A CHRONIC AND OFTEN DISABLING DISEASE AND OVER 50% OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH THEM MASS FALL- BETWEEN IN A THREE TO SIX MONTH PERIOD AND OVER THIRTY PERCENT. ALL MULTIPLE TIMES AT PERIOD HI THIS FUNDING WILL HELP PROVIDE ACCESSIBILITY FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH EN MASSE AND KEEP THEM SAFE IN THEIR HOME AND WE URGE YOU TO INCLUDE THIS AND BUDGET THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. JEFF HARDY KIA. AND TO YOUR PREVIOUS ONE I WOULD OFFER SAY IS THIS YOU NEED A SOLID INTERNET CONNECTION THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR SENIORS. PUT TO THIS AS AN EXAMPLE IS THIS I FELT THE DATE JUST OUTSIDE WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING. AND BECAUSE OF HAVING A KAISER PROGRAM THAT DID WITH ABOUT FALL WOULD JUST DIDN'T PREVENT I FELL. BUT SHOWING WHAT YOU DO SO YOU DON'T HURT YOURSELF WHEN THIS OCCURS IS EQUALLY AS IMPORTANT IN FALL PREVENTING FALLS FROM OCCURRING. THANK YOU SIR AND I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY. YES KEEP THE MODEL CALIFORNIA LINES FOR RETIRED AMERICANS WHEN THEY CONSIDERING SOME OF THE PROGRAMS I THINK IT'S REAL IMPORTANT TO. TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT YOU'RE SAVING BY. IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM AND WHAT YOU MAY DO WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THAT PARTICULARLY IN THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES SIDE IS. SCORE THE SAVINGS THERE AND FUND THE PROGRAM SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT KIND OF RECOMMENDATION BECAUSE THESE THESE THESE PROGRAMS ARE GOING TO SAVE A LOT A- LOT OF THE PROGRAMS WERE- LOOK AT A SAVE A LOT OF DOLLARS ON ONE END. MY HOPE. WHEN YOU TO THE BUT TERRY PROCESS YOU THINK LET'S AUGMENTATION NO IT'S A SAVING BECAUSE YOU LIKE WITH WHAT WAS INDICATED BEFORE- IF- OBJECTED TO GO THROUGH THE PROGRAM AT KAISER UP PROBABLY A BROKE LEG HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS WOULD HAVE COST JUST A- GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND GO THROUGH ALL THE TREATMENT NECESSARY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. HERE THEIR ACCOUNT YOU CAN RECEIVE SEE FOR A- HAVE FALLS IS A CRITICAL ISSUE WITH OUR OLDER PEOPLE- THE- FOLLOWING OFTEN RESULTS IN BROKEN HIPS. PRO CAN HELP FIX- AND THESE PEOPLE THEN HAVE TO GO TO A NURSING HOME. AND IN SOME CASES THEY NEVER RETURNED BACK HOME SO PREVENTING FALLS FOR OUR OLDER A CALIFORNIANS I THINK IS. A REAL ISSUE FOR US AND ONE WE NEED TO ADDRESS. THANK YOU SIR. HOW MONEY WITHDRAW RECALL MY COMPLEX HAS ONE OF THOSE THAT BARS IN THE BATHROOM BUT WE ALSO GOT A PULL CHAIN THAT ALERTS THEIR NEIGHBORS ONE DEFINITELY DOES HAVE A BALL OR SOME OTHER KIND OF EMERGENCY. AND THE ONLY KNOCK ON THE DOOR DID UP THERE STAFF WAR WE CALL NINE ONE ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. HI LISA COLEMAN WITH CHALCO WE LOOK AT THIS IS A WORK DETERRENT- PEOPLE THAT ARE ABLE TO IT TO REMAIN LIVING SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF THE SKILLS THEY'VE LEARNED. THIS IS YOUR OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS WORTH A POUND OF. SOMEWHERE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MA'AM SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS- I MAY WANT TO. ASK JUST. TO UNDERSTAND HOW MUCH OF THE FIVE MILLION. ONE TIME FUNDING FROM LAST YEAR IS ALREADY GONE OUT IS THIS PROGRAM. OVER PRESCRIBED IS THIS. SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE AN ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDING. FOR IS A ONE TIME APPROACH ASIAN. IT TOO HOW MUCH IS USE LAST YEAR. I CAN START THE ANSWERING CLAY CAN ADD ON THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS JUST COMPLETED ISSUING THE MONEY TO ALL THE LOCAL PROVIDER SO I BELIEVE LOCAL PROVIDERS ARE JUST BEGINNING TO SPEND. SET RIGHT. THAT'S CORRECT- SO THE FULL FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION HAS BEEN- RECALL YESTERDAY. DO DO WE HAVE A UNDERSTANDING OF HOW MUCH ROAD HOW MANY REQUESTS THERE WERE AND WHETHER WHAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE NEXT STEPS THAT TRYING TO. WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON THAT BECAUSE THE PROGRAM'S ROLLING OUT BUT I CAN GIVE ONE EXAMPLE WHICH I TOUCHED ON BEFORE- WE HAVE A- A VOLUNTEER PROGRAM THAT INSTALLS GRAB BARS LABORS FREE THEY JUST NEED TO MATERIALS. AND THEY'RE ALREADY- HAVE DOCUMENTED THEY NEED A FIFTEEN THOUSAND NOW JUST TO PURCHASE TO GRAB BARS AND LONGER RAILS SO IT'S ONLY ONE SMALL COMPONENT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING BUT THE DEMAND IS CERTAINLY THERE. WITH THAT WE HOLD THIS CHAIR CO. AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE A DE. TO THE INCREASING THE BASELINE ALLOCATION FOR AREA AGENCIES- ON AGING THERE'S SPENT MISTER CHAIR THERE'S BEEN NO ADJUSTMENT TO BASED ON FUNDING SINCE THE INCEPTION OF AREA AGENCIES FIFTY YEARS AGO. CURRENTLY BASED ON FUNDING IS FIFTY THOUSAND PER YEAR AND ALL FEDERAL DOLLARS THERE IS KNOWS THE GENERAL FUND DOLLARS FOR BASELINE FUNDING TO ASSIST THE- TRIPOLI'S IN ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES. I THINK THE REQUEST WOULD BE FOR. OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND. FOR EACH OF THE THIRTY THREE TRIPLE A LOCATIONS CENTERS. SO AN ANNUAL THREE POINT THREE MILLION REQUEST. THANK YOU- MR KEMP HAS A TRIPLE A DIRECTOR- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I'M BIASED BUT IT'S REALLY CRITICALLY NEEDED MONEY I'M GOING BACK FORTY YEARS I DIDN'T GO BACK FIFTY BUT- IN NINETEEN EIGHTY WITH FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YOU COULD BUY A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF TODAY'S SERVICES. USING BY FIGURES USING CALIFORNIA FIGURES IT'S MORE LIKE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND SO TRYING TO PROVIDE WHAT WE DID FORTY OR FIFTY YEARS AGO WITH LESS THAN A THIRD OF ACTUAL BUYING POWER PUTS TRIPLE A.'S IN AN EXTREME- BIND- WE'VE WE KNOW WE NEED AT A MINIMUM TO HAVE A FISCAL OFFICER- PLANNER CONTRACTOR- IN MY **** PERSON AND PROGRAM DIRECTOR AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE WEAR MULTIPLE HATS TO DO THAT. SO IF FIFTY THOUSAND WE CAN MAKE A DENT IN IT- I THINK ALL THE GREAT THINGS THAT RE COMING OUT TO WITH MASTER PLAN FOR AGING AND BY THE WAY ALL JOINED THE GROUP AT GOING YOU KNOW KIM'S PRAISES IN TERMS OF HOW INCREDIBLE THAT HAS BEEN BUT THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF HOW MUCH WE NEED TO DO. AND HOW AN AGENCY DOES THAT WITH ABOUT THIRTY PER OF THE RE TO THE A THE OUT IT NOW VERY REALISTIC. AND THEN IF WE HAVE UNEXPECTED CHRIST COME BY PERHAPS THE CORONA VIRUS WHERE WERE YOU KNOW CHIU TO HOW IMMEDIATE TO A CRISIS THAT ALL OUR SERVICES ARE FACE ING THERE'S NO RESEARCH AS WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW STAFF THAT PORTS SO WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT MAKING THAT TRIPLE A SYSTEM JETZT. NOT A STRONG BUT SERVICE. AS HOW IT WORKS DOLLARS THANK YOU SIR DEPARTMENT OF ANSEL. COMMENTS PUBLIC COM ON. TO I'M WENDY PETERSON MY DIRECT THE SENIOR SERVICES COALITION OF ALAMEDA COUNTY AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT OUR OF OUR CUNY IS HIGHLY COLLABORATIVE AND THE- TRIPLE A IS ONE OF OUR COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS AND IF THEY ARE. IT TAKES MONEY TO BE ABLE TO PUT ENERGY INTO COLLABORATION- AND WE EXPECT MORE COLLABORATION COMING IN THE FUTURE FROM THE MASTER PLAN FOR EATING SO WE HIGHLY STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BUT QUEST. GOOD AFTERNOON THEN LEASE A COMMON WITH CALCUTTA. WE ARE IN SUPPORT THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAMS- ARE EITHER HOUSED IN THE TRIPLE A.'S OR CONTRACTS WITH THE TRIPLE LAYS AND SO HAVING THAT- CONTRACTING EXPERTISE IN THAT BUILDING. IN THAT ENTITY MEANS THAT THE NUMBERS GET THAT MONEY THE RESOURCES THAT MUCH FASTER TO GET THE FEEL THAT MUCH FASTER SO WE DEFINITELY NEED STRONG TRIPOLI'S IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MA'AM. YES TERREL COACH WITH THE HEARING AGENCIES ON AGING. HOW WELL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE BASS LINE FUNDING IS JUST WAS IS TO TAKE TO OPEN UP THE DOORS. IN A CAN BE AN AGENT THE WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO FIND. HE KNOWS KEY STAFF WHO CAN WHO CAN AT LEAST DO THE MINIMAL PART OF THE JOB AND WE HAVE SOME AREA AGENCIES. IN THIS. AT LEAST. TO HAVE THE FUNDS TO KEEP THE DOORS OPEN. THANK YOU SIR. JEFF HEARD A KIA- I'M NOT A GREAT ONE FOR ADVERTISING FOR MORE ADMINISTRATION BUT AT THE SAME TIME PROTECT ME FROM THE RURAL SITUATION. YOU NEED TO PROVIDE AND IN THE FUTURE BETTER SERVICES MORE SERVICES SO I ACTIVELY SUPPORT THIS THANK YOU SIR SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS. SEEN NOT- THIS DOES SEEM A VERY REASONABLE REQUEST IN LIGHT OF A MASTER PLAN FOR AGING AND INCREASING RESPONSIBILITIES ONTO MANY OF THE TROUBLE IS AND SO I JUST DO THINK WITH THIS WILL HAVE TO BE A BIG PART OF THE CONVERSATION AS WE GO FORWARD AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENCE. ON THIS. NOW MOVES ISSUED TO E. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR ESTABLISHING THE OFFICE OF THE PATIENT REPRESENTATIVE- THANK YOU BYE. ALZHEIMER'S AND OTHER FORMS OF DEMENTIA ARE DISEASES WITH NO KNOWN TREATMENT I'M SORRY. JERRY I'M A PATIENT REPRESENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. CURRENTLY WHEN SKILLED NURSING FACILITY PATIENTS ARE DETERMINED BY THEIR PHYSICIAN TO LACK THE CAPACITY TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES AND DO NOT HAVE FAMILY OR FRIENDS TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS FOR THEM THAN MEDICAL DECISIONS ARE MADE BY IN THE DISCIPLINARY TEAM MADE UP OF NURSING STAFF AT THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AND THE PATIENT'S PHYSICIAN CALIFORNIA BUT OF APPEALS RECENTLY ISSUED A DECISION UPHOLDING THAT PROCESS BUT- THAT PROCESS BUT CLARIFIED THAT A PATIENT REPRESENTATIVE MUST PARTICIPATE IN THE INTERDISCIPLINARY MEETINGS. THE COURT ALSO PROHIBITS THESE PATIENT REPRESENTATIVES FROM BEING PAID FOR OR EMPLOYED BY THE NURSING FACILITY IF THERE'S NO PATIENT REPRESENTATIVE AVAILABLE MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS CANNOT OCCUR WITH THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY RESIDENT THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS FOR THAT RESIDENT TO GO TO A HOSPITAL FOR THEIR CARE IT IS IMPERATIVE THE STATE ECONOMY RESPONSIBILITY OF A STEP. STEM WHEREBY SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES RESIDENTS THIS TWO PIECE AND IF THAT IS PROPERLY AND A TESTABLE TO OUR- IN THE IN. TEAM MEETING. TODAY WITH ONE APPROACH TO THIS. WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING TO ESTABLISH AN OFFICE OF PATIENT REPRESENTATIVE TO FACILITATE AND TRAIN AVAILABLE AVAILABLE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. WITHME- IS JENNIFER SNYDER- TO ANSWER.FOR THE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU. JENNIFER CENTER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES AND JUST TO MAKE A COUPLE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AND TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS- INFORMATION THAT HE PROVIDED TODAY I THINK- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A- A STATUTE THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO ALMOST THIRTY YEARS- THAT. CREATES A PROCESS BY WHICH- A GROWING NUMBER OF PATIENTS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO HAVE SOMEONE MAKE MEDICAL DECISIONS FOR THEM WHEN THEY DON'T HAVE THAT CAPABILITY AND THEY DON'T HAVE A FAMILY OR FRIEND THAT'S AVAILABLE TO HELP THEM WITH THAT. AND THE COURT RULING UPHELD THAT PROCESS- AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO KNOW THAT THAT PROCESS CAN'T CONTINUE I AM IT'S JUST THEY REQUIRED TO THINGS OR AT LEAST CLARIFY THAT TWO THINGS NEED TO HAPPEN WITHIN THAT PROCESS ONE IS IT. THAT THERE'S CLEAR NOTIFICATION TO THE PATIENT AND TO THE FRONT OR FAMILY OR A INTO DOES IT. AND ME SURE THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THE PHYSICIAN HAS DETERMINED THAT A PATIENT IS INCAPACITATED AND THE SECOND PART IN THE PART OF THE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE TODAY- IS THAT THERE. IS A CLEAR- DIRECTION FROM THE COURT THAT IN ALL CASES WHEN THERE IS A DECISION MAKING PROCESS THAT HAPPENS IN THAT DECISION MAKING PROCESS IS ACTUALLY DEAL WITH. THOSE MEDICAL END INCLUDING THE PHYSICIAN AND THE MEDICAL TEAM AT THE SCHOOL THAT SAUDI BUT NOW THAT THERE'S A THERE NEEDS TO BE A PATIENT REPRESENTED PART OF THAT. THEY ARE IN A CERTAIN MAKER THEY ARE NOT. A QUARTER CONSERVATIVE. ISN'T IT SYSTEM IS SET UP IN. TEAM HEALTH IS BECAUSE- IT'S ALL POSSIBLE. FINE AND GET THAT DONE SO THIS IS A PREPPER THAT. CAN'T BE PAID FOR OR AFFILIATED WITH THE NURSING FACILITY WHICH IS JUST FINE IT IT PROBABLY A PROCESS SHOULD BE THERE BUT BECAUSE OF THAT SOMEBODY ELSE IS GONNA HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAKING SURE THAT THOSE PATIENTS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WHICH AGAIN DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES. THERE'S SOMEBODY THAT CAN CARRY ON THEIR GOAL FOR THEM- NEITHER THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STATED NOR- MY CLIENT CODE FOR SUSPICION HEALTH IS LEASES WENT TO THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE BEFORE YOU TODAY- WE ACTUALLY FELT THAT MAYBE THAT THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE IN THE OFFICE OF THE OMBUDSMAN THAT LOW ON BUT IT'S BEEN COULD TAKE ON THIS. I'M AT LEAST FROM WHAT WE UNDERSTAND- OF AT LEAST THE STATE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN SEEMS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT SO WE HAVE PROVIDED AN OPTION- THAT WE THINK REALLY DOES FIT WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING- AND- WE ARE LOOKING FOR. DIRECTION FROM THE ADMINISTRATION- WE'VE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS HELP- AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THIS DIALOGUE WITH THE SENATE COMMITTEE AND SINCE FOR THESE TO SPEAK THOUSAND HAVE NOT TO SPEAK FOR THEM THANK YOU. THE FINANCE LA. PUBLIC COMMENT ON TO HE. JEFF STARTED YEAH APPLICANTS HEALTHCARE OF VARIOUS OTHER BUT I WILL ALSO OFFER IN THIS ONE THEY SPY MUSCLE SURVIVOR SO WHAT MEANS IN A SENSE I HAVE NO DIRECT FAMILY TO MAKE THAT CONNECTION SO I WILL HAVE THAT NEED IN THE FUTURE TO SEE WHAT DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE AND I WILL OFFER A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE IN THIS LAST WEEK IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. HAD SOMEBODY THAT DIED. BUT THE DOCTORS WERE NOT WILLING TO TELL THE PERSON THAT WAS REPRESENTING THE FAMILY. THAT INDEED THAT PERSON WAS DYING IT TOOK OTHERS COMING IN AND A NURSE TO SAY GET THE FAMILY HERE HE IS GOING TO BE DEAD WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS. BUT THAT IS THE THING THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKING CARE OF THIS IS THAT SOMETIMES YOU KNOW FOR PATIENT. THE CORRECT DECISION NEED TO BE MADE AND THE CORRECT QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ASKED MAY NEED TO BE SOMEBODY OTHER THAN THE MEDICAL PROFESSION. SO THAT'S WHY THIS OFFICE NEEDS TO GET ESTABLISHED. THANK YOU SIR. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KERR CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA I THINK HAS IS SPEND NOTED THE COURT OF APPEAL HAS STATED THAT THESE ARE CRITICAL POSITIONS THAT- SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ASSIST IN THE DECISION MAKING AND I HAD TO ADD NOT ONLY JUST CRITICAL BUT CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED- WE EAT WE SUPPORT THIS- PROPOSAL AND WE THINK THAT THE APPROACH THAT'S BEEN LAID OUT HERE NOW ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME OPPORTUNITY TO WORK THROUGH THIS AND REFINE IT IS ACTUALLY THE RIGHT ONE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE AN OFFICE OF. PATIENTS REPRESENTATIVES AND WHAT THAT WILL ALLOW IS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TRAINED AND PROFESSIONAL GROUP THAT CAN ACTUALLY SERVE ACROSS STRAIGHT ACROSS THE STATE TO PROVIDE THESE SERVICES THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. THIS FEATURE MEMBERS RAN MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF OF LEADING AGE CALIFORNIA- WE APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY THIS IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF IMPLEMENTING THIS DECISION- WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE I'M AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO FIND THE RIGHT FIT. I'M TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE THIS PATIENT REPRESENTATIVE- FOR THEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. PLAY CAM SENIORS COUNSELLORS SANTA CRUZ AND SAN BENITO COUNTY IS AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE RIGHT FIT FOR THIS IS EITHER WHETHER THIS IS IT OR NOT I WON'T COMMENT TOWARDS THAT. BUT I WILL SAY THIS IS MAYBE THE MOST FREQUENT POLICY ISSUE. THAT LOCAL NURSING HOMES BRING TO ME THAT THEY HAVE SITUATIONS WITH UNREPRESENTED ELDERLY WHO- AREN'T CAPABLE OF MAKING DECISIONS ON THEMSELVES AND THEY NEED TO TAKE. ACTION IN IN TERMS OF MEDICAL CARE AND LEGALLY THEY CAN'T DO IT SO- I GET THE CALL SAYING HELP ME WHAT CAN I DO. UNFORTUNATELY RIGHT NOW MY ANSWERS I DON'T KNOW NOTHING. I THINK IT'S. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS JOE RODRIGUEZ CALIFORNIA STATE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN I DO AGREE THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR AN OFFICE OF THE PATIENT REPRESENTATIVE AND AS WAS STATED EARLIER- I AM IN OPPOSITION TO THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM TAKING THAT RESPONSIBILITY ON FEDERAL LAW AND REGULATIONS- PROHIBIT ON WAS IN PROGRAMS TO ENGAGE IN CIRCUIT DECISION MAKING. FOR RESIDENTS OF LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES AND WHILE THE PATIENT REPRESENTATIVE ISN'T A SURROGATE DECISION MAKER IN AND OF HIMSELF. WHEN PAIRED WITH THE WORK OF THE ITT THE INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM YOU ARE ENGAGING IN CIRCUIT DECISION MAKING FOR RESIDENTS- WE THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM AGAIN. UNDER FEDERAL REGULATIONS IS ALSO PROHIBITED FROM RESIDING IN AN ENTITY THAT ENGAGES CIRCUIT DECISION MAKING FOR RESIDENTS SO I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND I'M NOT GOING TO I'M SPEAKING FOR THE OFFICE OF THE STATE LONG TERM CARE BUT IT'S BEEN. I WOULD HAVEGRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE OFFICE BEING LOCATED IN THE SAME DEPARTMENT THAT WERE HOUSED WITHIN. I'M WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY OTHER POSSIBILITIES AND- DO AGREE THOUGH THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AN OFFICE OF THE PATIENT REPRESENTATIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU MARTY MOTO FAMILY MEMBER US YOU CAN'T HELP ME DISABILITY YOU'RE COMING ACTION NETWORK MY SISTER WAS AN ALPHA SILLY ACTION OR NURSING HOME. FOR BRIEF PERIODS IN OUR LIFE AND SO AGAIN MY FAMILY AND OTHER PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES UNDERSTAND. THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING ONE'S RIGHTS- SUPPORT THE CONCEPT AND- AND FOR ALL FOR ALL THE REASONS GIVEN. NOT NOW ALSO MEANT TO SAY I SUPPORT THE ITEM DE ON THE BASELINE FUNDING THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. GOOD AFTERNOON LISA COLEMAN WITH CALCUTTA AND I'M NOT STANDING IN SUPPORT. I DON'T KNOW THAT I'M STANDING IN OPPOSITION TO THE OFFICE OF THE PATIENT ADVOCATE. BUT I DO CHALLENGED THAT I. AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH WITH A BIT DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS. IF THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE THING TO DO TO CREATE YET ANOTHER STATE OFFICE- WE WOULD ARGUE THAT THESE PEOPLE NEED TO BE CONSERVED AND THE CONSERVATIVE TEA PROCESS AS IT IS TODAY TAKES TOO LONG. BUT BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WE HAVETAKES TOO LONG IS NOT NECESSARILY A JUSTIFICATION FOR THE CREATION OF YET ANOTHER STATE ENTITY. I DO THINK THAT- THERE'S DUELING LAWYERS OPINIONS AT THIS POINT ON WHAT THIS COURT CASE SAYS AND THAT RATHER THAN DECIDING. A COURSE OF ACTION THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK WE NEED TO ASK THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT THIS DECISION WE NEED TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF A PUBLIC HEALTH TO DO A CENSUS OF POINT AND COUNT. A POINT IN TIME COUNT HOW MANY RESIDENTS ARE WE REALLY TALKING ABOUT WE DON'T HAVE. I MAY BE WRONG BUT I DO NOT BELIEVE WE HAVE A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY IN EVERY COUNTY SO WHY WOULD WE WANT TO HAVE AN OFFICE OF A PATIENT ADVOCATE IN A COUNTY THAT DOESN'T HAVE A NURSING FACILITY. WE CAME BEFORE YOU FOR SO MANY YEARS TO GET FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. I AM I'M JUST CONCERNED IS THIS REALLY THE BEST APPROACH- BUT I DO RECOGNIZE THAT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE. FUNDAMENTALLY AT THE END OF THE DAY A PERSON THAT HAS NO VOICE AND HAS NO ONE TO SPEAK FOR THEM IS THE MOST VULNERABLE PERSON AND SO. I DON'T THINK WE WOULD EVER SAY THAT THEY DON'T NEED TO BE REPRESENTED BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS THE BEST APPROACH. THANK YOU MA'AM. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE SUB COMMITTEE. AND IF I CAN I'D LIKE TO ASK THE SPONSORS FIRST. HAVE YOU BEEN GIVEN ANY FEEDBACK FROM THE TRIPLE A.'S ON WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED- ON THE LOCAL SIDE TO THIS CONCEPT. I CAN SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MY CLIENT CALPERS DECISION HELPLESSLY AS WE DID WE HAVE MET WITH THE TRIPLE A AS I KNOW THAT- THERE'S ALSO- SENATOR PAN HAS EGISLATION SB TEN FORTY THREE THAT'S ALSO LOOKING AT THE PRACTICALITIES OF IMPLEMENTATION AND THEY'VE BUT THEY WERE INVOLVED IN A RECENT MEETING- I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE TRIPLE A.'S BUT I HAVE NOT. THE LEAST THE INITIAL RESPONSE WAS NOT OPPOSITION TO THIS IDEA- I THINK THE ENVISIONING IS THAT. THIS THIS THIS OFFICE WOULD NOT BE A LARGE STRUCTURE OF ANY KIND IT WOULD JUST BE A- FACILITATOR OF MAKING SURE THAT IN EVERY. IN AREAS WHERE IT'S NEEDED- IT COULD DEPEND ON THE STRUCTURE OF EACH COUNTY HOW THEY CURRENTLY HANDLES THEIR THEIR AGING OR SENIOR PROGRAMS THAT THERE IS SOMEBODY THERE THAT CAN TAKE ON THAT RESPONSIBILITY FOR NURSING HOME GIVE THEM A CALL- SO- I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE TRIP LAZILY SOME. OUR INITIAL DISCUSSIONS WE HAVEN'T HEARD STRONG OPPOSITION TO THAT- TO BOTH THE- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING AS WELL AS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GIVEN THIS COURT DECISION HAS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OFFICE OR SOMETHING. THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS. ACTIVELY CONSIDERING GOING FORWARD. WITH YES AS OTHERS HAVE SAID THAT THE LEAD ON THIS IS THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY BECAUSE IT INVOLVES. A PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF AGING THE OFFICE A LONG TERM CARE BUT SEVERAL PARTS OF OUR AGENCY FAMILY AND WE HAVE HAD ONGOING CREATIVE COLLABORATIVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW TO INTERPRET THIS. DECISION AND HOW TO BEST RESPOND TO AND I BELIEVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE- ANY INSIGHT YOU CAN PROVIDE ON HOW THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING WHICH ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE PROPOSAL WE'RE HEARING HERE TODAY. THIS IS ONE OF THE ONES IN THE MIX I THINK AS AS MY FELLOW PANELISTS HAVE SAID IT'S- WE'RE WORKING THROUGH THE OPERATIONAL THE LOGISTICAL LEGAL. FISCAL IT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY IN THE MIX IN THIS CONVERSATION A FAIR REFLECTION OF AND- I'VE HEARD IT ALLUDED TO WHEN I DON'T MEAN TO ASK. LONG TERM- BUT THE MAN TO TAKE ON MORE RESPONSIBILITIES THAN. ARE ALREADY BEFORE THEM AND THEY MAY BE PRECLUDED FROM IT. BUT I AM SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT WE WILL FINALLY GAVE THEM AN INCREASE LAST YEAR AND WILL BE ASKING. MUCH MORE IF WE WOULD ASK THEM TO TAKE ON THIS RESPONSIBILITY IF THEY COULD EVEN TO THIS AND SO- DO THINK WE NEED SOMEONE WHO'S- ADVOCATING AT THE BEDSIDE AND JUST WOULD ASK- THE DEPARTMENTS TO WORK WITH US TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE COULD DO BEST WITH THAT. SO WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE. TO EAT OPEN AND MOVE ON TO TWO F. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. NOW GOING TO F. CREATING A THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM ON DEMENTIA CARE GIVER EDUCATION. ALZHEIMER'S AND OTHER FORMS OF DEMENTIA DISEASES WITH NO KNOWN TREATMENT TO SLOW OR STOP THE PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE OFTEN WHEN THE FAMILY GETS A DIAGNOSIS OF ALZHEIMER'S OR DEMENTIA THEY'RE LEFT WITH MANY QUESTIONS AND NOT MUCH INFORMATION. THIS BUDGET REQUEST A FIVE MILLION WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED BY AB TWO THOUSAND ONE WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH A THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM FOR DEMENTIA CARE GIVER EDUCATION IT WOULD FUND TEN SITES TO CREATE AND IMPLEMENT CARE GIVER EDUCATION PROGRAMS. AN EMPHASIS WOULD BE MADE ON SITES THAT WILL SERVE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES IN VARIOUS GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS ACROSS THE STATE PRIORITY WOULD BE GIVEN TO PROGRAMS THAT ARE CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE AND LINGUISTICALLY ACCESSIBLE. BECAUSE OF OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES ARE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES ARE AT HIGHER RISK AND HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS IF WE KEEP CARE GIVERS HEALTHY AND SUPPORTED THEY CAN KEEP THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AT HOME LONGER. AVOIDING COSTLY NURSING HOMES INDIVIDUALS WITH DEMENTIA COST MEDI CAL TWENTY THREE TIMES MORE. THAN THE AVERAGE MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS. WITH OUR INCREASING OLDER POPULATION ADULT POPULATION WE KNOW THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA IS GOING TO INCREASE EXPONENTIALLY MEANING THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES CARING FOR SOMEONE WITH DEMENTIA. IS ALSO GOING TO INCREASE EXPONENTIALLY IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE INVEST IN OUR CARE GIVERS NOW- WITH ME. IS MONICA MILLER. ATTEST TO. PROVIDE SOME COMMENTS ON THIS AS WELL THANK YOU. MISTER TURNER- MIKE THE TIGER THE BOYS SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT- BUT FOR SOMETHING FOR HAVING US% TODAY MONICA MILLER AND I REPRESENT ALZHEIMER'S LOS ANGELES ALZHEIMER'S WHICH COUNTY AND ALL TIME SAN DIEGO WHO BROUGHT THIS PROPOSAL FORWARD WHEN I POINT OUT THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD NOT DIRECTLY. GO TO ON ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE IT JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE WITHIN THE TEN SITES ON ALZHEIMER'S IS A PROGRESSIVE DISEASE IT GETS WORSE IT DOESN'T GET BETTER WE FIND THAT THESE CARE GIVERS STRUGGLE IN TERMS OF FINDING RESOURCES RESPITE CARE SUPPORT SERVICES PARTICULARLY. ON AND IF THEY'RE NOT IF IT MEANS TO HAVE SOMEONE TO COME INTO THE HOME TO HELP THEM SO WE HAVE A GREAT SUCCESS WITH THESE PROGRAMS WITH ABOUT FORTY STATE WIDE ON AND ALZHEIMER'S LOS ANGELES OF HIM CITY AGO AT ALL TIMES ORANGE COUNTY REPRESENT- SEVEN CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY AND AGAIN WE KIND OF THESE PROBLEMS ARE VERY SUCCESSFUL WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS TAKEN STATEWIDE IT WOULD BE A FIFTY THREE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM THAT WOULD SUNSET IN FIVE YEARS- AND THEN WE COULD LOOK AT THE DATA AND SEE. WHAT THE IMPACTS WERE AND SEE HOW WE CAN HELP THIS COMMUNITY BECAUSE THESE CHARACTERS DESPERATELY NEED HELP WE FOUND THAT WHEN WE DO PROVIDE THESE PROGRAMS THAT THEY ARE BETTER SERVED QUICK TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANAGE THE PRESS HI MAN. THE THAT DEALING WITH. HOW TO MANAGE. LIFE AND BECAUSE IT IS A VERY STRESSED SO. PARTICULARLY WHEN A CLOSE MEMBER. HOW TO ANSWER ANY. AGAIN THIS PART AB TWO. ONE SO THERE IS A LOT. CA AND LET JUST ON THE LIPS OF COMPLEX PACIFIC RECESSED. UPON APPROPRIATION. ON FROM THE BUDGET SO THIS BILL WOULD NOT BE ACTED AT THE FUNDING IS NOT APPROVED. IF THAT HAPPENED ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MA'AM- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA. PUBLIC COMMENT ON TWO F. SEEING NONE I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE COMMITTEE. WE WILL HOLD THIS OPEN AND MOVE ON TO TWO G. THAT'S OKAY. THIRD IN THIS AREA AND I MAY ASK- YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME TO STAY THERE UNTIL ISSUE FOR BUT WE ARE GOING TO DO TO G. BEFORE. TO JEAN OKAY AND I GOT A HORSE THANK YOU. I WILL BE BACK OKAY. GOOD AFTERNOON- CHERRY MEMBERS MY NAME IS SHERRY DREW SO I AM THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR FOR THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION I'LL BE SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THIS ITEM AND INCREASE THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING BUDGET OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A ONE TIME FUNDING TO UPDATE A GUIDE FOR CONSUMERS WHO MAY HAVE ALZHEIMERS OR DEMENTIA CALLED PARTNERING WITH YOUR DOCTOR- WHICH IS A COMPANY AT WHICH IS AN ACCOMPANYING BUDGET REQUEST WITH US ONLY MEMBER LOW MOANS BILL AB TWENTY FORTY EIGHT- BUT FIRST LET ME ECHO COMMENTS FROM EARLIER AND SAY HELP. OUR ASSOCIATION IS TO THE WORK BEING DONE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING INDIVIDUALS WITH ALZHEIMER'S AND DEMENTIA DEPEND ON SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT WHETHER THAT BE THE TRIPLE A.'S- THEIR HEALTH PROMOTION WORK THE LONG TERM CARE ON A LONG TERM I'M SORRY LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM AND THE FAMILY KERR CARE GIVER RESOURCES AND SO MUCH MORE- BUT IT ADDITIONALLY AS- EVERYBODY IS AWARE- IS A VERY SPECIAL YEAR AS THE DEPARTMENT ENGAGES IN THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING- COLLABORATIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT THAT WE BELIEVE WELL- MEET THE NEEDS OF. CALIFORNIA'S ASIAN. THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION IS A PARTOF THAT MASTER PLAN PROCESS WE'RE EXCITED TO CONTINUE- TO ENGAGE IN THAT WORK AND TO ADVOCATE FOR THAT WORK. WITH RESPECT TO THIS BUDGET ITEM- AS MANY- NO ALZHEIMER'S AS A DEEP IMPACT ON OUR STATE NEARLY SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS N OUR STATE. HAVE ALZHEIMER'S- THERE IS NO KNOWN CURE. AND IT IS CURRENTLY- THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH- HERE IN CALIFORNIA- ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES FACING THOSE WITH ALZHEIMER'S. IS NOT BEING ABLE TO RECEIVE A TIMELY DIAGNOSIS. NATIONALLY LESS THAN HALF OF INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVING WITH THE DISEASE HAVE BEEN GIVEN A DIAGNOSIS AND THIS PREVENTS THEM. FROM BEING ABLE TO CARE PLAN- LIFE PLAN WITH THEIR FAMILY AND CARE AND LOVED ONES AND TO ENGAGE IN CRUCIAL CLINICAL TRIALS THAT WILL LEAD TO A CURE. THIS YEAR OUR ASSOCIATION IS PRIORITIZING POLICY SOLUTIONS THAT HELP- MORE INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE A TIMELY DIAGNOSIS WHICH INCLUDES THE POLICY IN BUDGET ITEMS UPDATED STATE DEVELOP GUIDE. CALLED PARTNERING WITH YOUR DOCTOR. THIS GUIDE WAS CREATED IN TWO THOUSAND THREE BY THE STATE'S HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN COLLABORATION WITH ALL TIMES ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION. AND IT HELPS PREPARE CONSUMERS FOR CRUCIAL DOCTORS VISITS IT HELPS GUIDE PEOPLE THROUGH THE COMPLICATED AN EMOTIONAL PROCESS OF SEEKING AND RECEIVING A DIAGNOSIS. WHILE WE BELIEVE MUCH OF THE CORE OF THIS GUIDE IS STILL VALUABLE MUCH HAS CHANGED IN SEVENTEEN YEARS. I IN PARTICULAR WE BELIEVE WE MUST FOCUS ON CULTURAL COMPETENCY AS WE UPDATE THIS GUIDE. NOT ONLY IS CALIFORNIA GETTING OLDER AS- AS WAS STATED EARLIER BUT OUR AGING POPULATION CONTINUES TO GROW MORE DIVERSE. IF RESOURCES LIKE THESE DON'T SPEAK TOWARD DIVERSE COMMUNITIES INDIVIDUALS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO UTILIZE RESOURCES LIKE THIS GUIDE AND IT WILL NOT HAVE THE DESIRED IMPACT THAT WE BELIEVE IT CAN HAVE. WE ARE AGAIN I'M PROPOSING A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT THE DEPARTMENT IN THIS WORK A TO UPDATE THE GUIDE TO ENSURE THAT IT IS A VALUABLE RESOURCE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS- AND WE LOOK TO CONTINUE TO COLLABORATE WITH THE DEPARTMENT ON THIS WORK AS WELL AS- THE MASTER PLAN AN AGING PROCESS. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SIR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HELLO. PUBLIC COMMENT ON TWO G. LISA CALLING WITH CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION WE BELIEVE THAT THIS- FUNDING EFFORT IS A WORK DETERRENT FOR US IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE IT'S ALLOWING THE- PERSON TO MAKE DECISIONS AND GET THEIR- AFFAIRS IN ORDER SO THAT WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE WHATEVER OFFICE OF WHATEVER WE'RE GOING TO CREATE BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY EXPRESSED THEIR WISHES SO WE ARE STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU MA'AM- FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND FOR DEAL LAUGH IS THE UPDATING OF THIS GUIDE BOOK POSSIBLY SOMETHING THAT COULD BE DONE OR ABSORBED WITH EXISTING RESOURCES. THAT WHAT I HAVE TO DEFER TO THE DIRECTORY. WE HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY ALZHEIMER'S DEDICATED STAFF WERE COMMUNICATIONS DEDICATED STAFF SO WELL WELL WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THE VISION I WOULD HAVE TO SOME MORE WORK ON THAT GREAT WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TWO G. OPEN AND RETURN TO TWO WAY IF WE MAY ASSEMBLYMEMBER POWER CAN. YEAH. NO WAY. SAFETY FIRST RIGHT. THEY WERE LIKE MY EXCITEMENT. WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AS SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT THE POPULATION OF OLDER CALIFORNIANS EACH SIXTY FIVE HAS GROWN BY OVER 40% TO FIFTY FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS WILL GROW BY ANOTHER 60% AN OLDER PEOPLE REPRESENT MORE THAN 20% OF THE CALIFORNIA POPULATION. IS THE AGING POPULATION IT HAS GROWN IT IS ALSO BECOME POOR 49% OF CALIFORNIANS OVER SIXTY FIVE ARE LIVING BELOW 20% OF THE FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY LEVEL. ECONOMIC AND SECURITY OF OLDER ADULT HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA INCREASES WITH AGE JUST TO SENIORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS PHYSICAL OR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT THEY ARE LESS ABLE TO AFFORD THE SUPPORT OF INNER INTERVENTIONS THAT WILL KEEP THEM STABLE WITHOUT SUPPORTS STRESSORS ILLNESS RELATIONSHIP BOSS ISOLATION CAUGHT IN JULY THE CLUB IN A BIG BILL CAN STABILIZE THEM PUTTING AT RISK FOR REPEAT REALIZATION. NURSING HOMES AND HOUSING LOSS AND HOMELESSNESS AND NOW MORE THAN EVER WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING PEOPLE HOME IT OF OUR HOSPITALS IF POSSIBLE. THIS IS WHY SENIOR HOMELESSNESS IS ON THE RISE A LARGE AND GROWING POPULATION OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION ARE OVER FIFTY AND HOMELESS FOR THE FIRST TIME. COMMUNITY BASED SUPPORTIVE SERVICES ADDRESSES THE STRESSORS FOCUSING THEIR HIGH TOUCH APPROACH ON ISSUES COMMON TO LATER LIFE STAGES. FOR EXAMPLE INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE HELPS PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START OR HOW TO FIND SERVICES OR SOLUTIONS. CASE MANAGEMENT SUPPORTS PEOPLE WITH COMPLEX ISSUES IT COMPLEMENTS MEDICAL CARE CONNECTS CLIENTS WITH PUBLIC AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES AND HELPS BUILD TO RECONNECT NETWORKS OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY. SENIOR CENTERS KEEP PEOPLE CONNECTED TO COMMUNITY BUILDING FRIENDSHIPS AND PROMOTING LEARNING LAUGHTER IN INTERACTIVE DISCUSSION. THROUGH MEALS HEALTH EDUCATION INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE CLASSES AND AFFINITY GROUPS. VISITING PROGRAMS REDUCES FEELINGS OF ISOLATION ANXIETY AND LONELINESS. ADULT DAYCARE PROVIDE SAFE WELCOMING ENVIRONMENTS AND MONITORING OF COMPLEX MEDICAL CONDITIONS AS WELL AS STIMULATING SOCIALIZATION AND THERAPEUTIC ACTIVITIES. OFTEN IT ENABLES FAMILY CAREGIVERS TO WORK. SB GIVES FAMILY CAREGIVERS THE BREAK THEY NEED TO RECHARGE AND TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN HEALTH. LEGAL ASSISTANCE DEFEND THE SENIOR RIGHTS PROTECTS ASSETS IN ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND PUBLIC BENEFITS BITES EVICTIONS RESTRUCTURES LEANS. MEDIATES TENANTS SITUATIONS AND SUPPORTS FAMILY UNITY. CALIFORNIA HAS PROVIDED ZERO FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM FOR A DOZEN YEARS THEY EXIST BECAUSE THE FEDERAL FUNDING THAT HAS REMAINED MOSTLY FLAT THIS IS CONSTRAINED LOCAL EFFORTS TO GROW CAPACITY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR GROWING AGING POPULATION. BUT IN AMOUNTS TO ANNUAL REDUCTIONS AS THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS CONTINUE TO RISE. WELL SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE STEPPED UP TO AUGMENT GROWING FUNDING GAPS LOCAL FUNDING IS NOT ENOUGH TO INCREASE CAPACITY TO MEET THE NEED. IN FACT THE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS SERVED BY THE CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM DROPPED FROM NINETEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE IN TWO THOUSAND AND 721-100-0100 THIRTY NINE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. FOR ADULT DAYCARE. I WANT TO INTRODUCE TWENTY PETERSON FROM THE ALAMEDA SENIOR SERVICE COALITION WHO WILL SPEAK ON THIS BUDGET ASK. HEARD OF THANK YOU. I NEED HELP- GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS- I AM- I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER- IT IS OUR OUR- I WON IT EXPRESS OUR GRATITUDE FOR- HER SPONSORSHIP OF OUR BUDGET REQUEST. AND IT'S A REAL HONOR TO BE SITTING NEXT TO HER TODAY- I JUST WANTED TO ELEVATE- ONE POINT WHICH IS WHY IS THIS SEEMINGLY SIMPLE. SO THE PROGRAM SO CRITICAL- AND I THINK THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SPOKE TO THAT BUT I WANTED TO I WANTED TO POINT OUT TO YOU YOU HAVE A- GRATEFUL ORDERS THAT WERE HANDED OUT EARLIER- YOU KNOW WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THE HOUSING CRISIS RIGHT NOW HOUSING AND SECURITY IS INCREASINGLY A SENIOR CRISIS- AND A LARGE AND GROWING PORTION OF. THE POPULATION OF HOMELESS PEOPLE IS OLDER- IN OUR REGION OF THE BAY AREA PEOPLE AGE. IN SOME CITIES AT LEAST PEOPLE AGE FIFTY PLUS MAKE UP- ALMOST HALF OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION AND PEOPLE SIXTY PLUS MAKE UP FOURTEEN OR MORE PERCENT OF THE TOTAL POINT IN TIME COUNT- AND THE MOST HOLY IN FACT I THINK. IS ABOUT ALL THREE QUARTERS OF FOUR TO SIX ONE QUARTER OF THESE PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS FOR THE FIRST TIME. SO IN YOUR FOLDER YOU'LL SEE THEIR THEIR PROFILES OF OLDER PEOPLE WHO WE'VE MET IN THE COURSE OF STUDY IN THIS PHENOMENON IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ALAMEDA COUNTY AND MANY STAKEHOLDERS- AND I WANT TO POINT TO A GRAPHIC- IN THE PACKET THAT IS ESSENTIALLY A MAP OF THE- OLDER ADULT HOUSING CRISIS IT SHOWS THE UNDERLYING ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. THAT MAKE UP. THAT THAT REALLY MAKES SENIORS VULNERABLE. AND THE STRESSORS THAT CAN HIT A NEAT MAY DESTABILIZE A PERSON AND WITHOUT INTERVENTION CAN LEAD TO DISPLACEMENT- HOUSING INSTABILITY AND ALL TOO OFTEN HOMELESSNESS. WELL THE CDA SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY ARE EXACTLY EXACTLY THE PROGRAMS THAT CAN INTERVENE IN THIS PROGRESSION- ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT POOR ENOUGH YET- TO QUALIFY FOR PUBLIC PROGRAMS THEY OFTEN REPRESENT LIFELINES FOR OLDER PEOPLE WHO ARE ECONOMICALLY INSECURE- BUT NOT POOR ENOUGH- AND ISOLATED. OF THE ADDRESS THOSE STRESSORS- WITH IT WITH A HIGH TOUCH APPROACH- ELLAND. THEIR ABILITY TO STABILIZE AN INDIVIDUAL IN A FAMILY- AND KEEP THEM FROM DISPLACEMENT AND- AND HOMELESSNESS IS PROFOUND. SO WE REALLY NEED SERVICE CAPACITY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- AND- THAT THAT'S REALLY WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT CALIFORNIA INVEST IN THE- DEPARTMENT ON ANSWER QUESTIONS. BERMAN FINANCE L. L. PUBLIC COMMENT ON TO A. YES IT HAS A WORK DETERRENT FOR US KEEPING PEOPLE IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT THAT IS SAFE AND IF IT IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE THAN IT'S A JUST A DOUBLE WIN ALL THE WAY AROUND SO WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT.

ON EVERYDAY TOPICS TO ACTUALLY GOING ON A WALK OR MAYBE- EVEN SOME SHOPPING ERRANDS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE BUT IT REALLY DOES ADDRESS THE ISOLATION ISSUE THAT TO THAT WE FACE NOW. AND THERE WAS- THERE WAS A STUDY COMPLETED WHAT FOR BE. HAS THE SAME. AS SMOKING SIX FIFTEEN A DAY PHYSICALLY MENTALLY AND EMOTIONALLY SO IT HAS A VERY TRAGIC- CONSEQUENCE FOR THOSE THAT ARE ISOLATED IN THIS IS ONE PROGRAM THAT CAN HELP ALLEVIATE THAT- CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IS VERY SIMILAR- DOES HAVE A COUPLE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS WERE ACTUALLY PUT TOGETHER A CARE PLAN FOR THE SENIORS BASED ON THEIR IMMEDIATE NEEDS.

I WANT TO CLARIFY LITTLE BIT I THOUGHT YOUR COMMENT WAS ON COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS REGARDING. THE PROPOSAL THAT'S BEFORE US BEING COST NEUTRAL AND SO JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE ABOUT THAT SIR. YES THE PROPOSAL IN ITSELF DOESN'T HAVE ANY FISCAL IMPACT THE LIKE THAT BECAUSE WE DON'T- PREDICT- IN OUR MULTI YEAR FUNDING WE DON'T PREDICT. NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN COUNTIES AND- BECAUSE RIGHT NOW COUNTIES HAVE A SHARE OF COSTS ONE WAY. WHEN THEY HAVE A NEW INCREASE IN THEIR WAGES SO BUT WE DON'T MAKE THOSE PREDICTIONS BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA. HAPPEN WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO ISSUE FOR D. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN THE SAME VEIN OF ENSURING THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AT LOCAL LEVELS ARE HAPPENING IN A REASONABLE TIME AND WITH GOOD FAITH EFFORTS WE REQUESTED COUNTIES BE REQUIRED TO PUBLICLY DISCLOSE VENDOR CONTRACTS ASSOCIATED WITH AYE HSS NEGOTIATIONS. UNFORTUNATELY IS COME TO OUR ATTENTION THAT SOME COUNTIES CONTRACT WITH ANTI UNION LAW FIRMS TO REPRESENT THEM AND I HSS NEGOTIATIONS AND THESE OF COURSE ARE FUNDED BY TAXPAYERS TRANSPARENCY ON THESE ISSUES IS PARAMOUNT PARTICULARLY ONE TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE INVOLVED THIS IS WHY WE ARE REQUESTING THAT THERE BE A MANDATE OF PUBLIC DISCLOSURE REGARDING COSTS PAID BY COUNTIES FOR VENDOR CONTRACTS USED FOR AYE HSS NEGOTIATIONS WE MUST KNOW HOW COUNTIES OR SPEND THESE DOLLARS. HOW MUCH THEY ARE SPENDING TO NEGOTIATE THESE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. THIS PAST SUMMER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I REALIZE I DIDN'T INTRODUCE MYSELF BEFORE A CRISTINA BOSS HAMILTON- WITH YOU YOU W. ASKED ME REPRESENTING HUNDRED SIXTEEN THOUSAND I JUST AS PROVIDERS AND TWENTY ONE COUNTIES I DO WANT TO ALSO SAY THAT WE- DIDN'T BRING OUR FOLKS TODAY BECAUSE OF CONCERNS AROUND A COAL BID. NINETEEN SO. YES SO THIS ISSUE HAS TO DO WITH THE PHENOMENON AND THIS IS IN IN EVERY COUNTY BUT A NUMBER OF THEM WERE THEY WILL OUTSOURCE THE ACTUAL NEGOTIATIONS TO- USUALLY A LAW FIRM THERE IS- ANOTHER VENDOR THAT IS NOT A LAW FIRM BUT- AS A STAND SIMPLY THEY- ARE OUTSOURCING THE- ACTUAL NEGOTIATIONS BUT- IN CASES WHERE THESE. NEGOTIATIONS GO ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS. OUR CONCERN IS THAT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THEY'RE PAYING ESPECIALLY TO THE LAW FIRMS WHO CHARGE TO THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS AN HOUR WHEN YOU ADD THAT UP COMPARE TO WHAT THE COST WOULD HAVE BEEN TO JUST INCREASE. THE WAGES OF THE WORKERS THAT YOU ACTUALLY DON'T FIND THAT MUCH OF A FISCAL DIFFERENCE THERE AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE PROPOSING DISCLOSURE IS BECAUSE WE HAVE FILED FOR. THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUESTS TO ACTUALLY DETERMINE WHAT THE COSTS ARE AND IT'S BEEN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT BASED ON WHAT WE RECEIVED AND WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL COUNTIES THAT REFUSED TO SEND IT TO US- TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHAT THE A LINE ITEM IS FOR I JUST AS- BARGAINING SO WE BELIEVE. THAT IN CASES FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU COUNTY WERE BURNING HAS BEEN GOING ON SIX YEARS AND YOU KNOW THERE ARE FOR THAT REPRESENT MULTI COUNTIES. THAT THE ACTUALLY CREW A VERY. EIGHT BIT IS PLAN. FOR JUST TRAINING A CON SOURCE OF INCOME BY VIRTUE OF THESE NEGOTIATIONS JUST GOING ON AND ON THANK YOU. CAN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ARE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TELL US WHAT YOU THINK OF THIS PROPOSAL. HI. BUT DALY DIFFERENT WE DON'T HAVE ANY. POSITIONS ON THIS PROPOSAL THAT THE TIME. DOES THE DOES THE MANDATE ON COUNTIES WORK FOR FROM THE STATE ADMINISTRATION PERSPECTIVE. WHAT WHAT THE 80% MANDATE WORK FOR STATE ADMINISTRATION. NOT QUITE SURE WHAT I'M GETTING QUIRK AGAIN THAT SIR- THE PROPOSAL REQUIRES TRANSPARENCY IF IT'S GOING TO EXCEED 80% OF THE TOTAL COST OF WAGE AND BENEFIT INCREASES THAT SOMETHING THE- ADMINISTRATION. DO. I'M NOT SURE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU I THINK OF ROTH THE MANDATE THE COUNTY TO DO ANYTHING THERE'S A COSTS ABOUT PEACE THERE FOR THEM TO DO THE ACTIVITY BUT- YEAH WILL HAVE TO GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BUT I. CAN'T GIVE YOU A DIFFERENT ANSWER MOM- AS WITH THE PREVIOUS ON THE FOLLOWING PROPOSAL THE ADVOCATES ASSERT THAT THERE'S NO GENERAL FUND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS AND SO WE JUST. ASK THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE SOME TECHNICAL- EXPERTISE IF YOU CAN SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO ASSERTIF THAT'S A REALITY. I WOULD JUST BELIEVE THAT ON WILL HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS TO BUT OVERALL I THINK ON THE STATE THERE MIGHT NOT BE AND BUT IF YOU'D LIKE THAT IF YOU'D REQUIRE THE COUNTY TO DO ANYTHING AND- THERE WILL BE A FISCAL IMPACT THE TO LOCAL MANDATE SO. JUST TAKING THAT TO CONSIDERATION. AT THE END OF THE DAY I'D RATHER. PAY WORKERS THAN LAWYERS JUST AS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE AND SOME WITH THAT AS A LAWYER I THINK THAT'S STILL A GOOD IDEA. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO MOVE ON TO FORTY PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WELL WE DISCUSS FINDINGS TO WAKE I'M SORRY WELL WE DISCUSS FINDINGS FINDING WAYS TO MAKE THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS MORE FEASIBLE AND TRANSPARENT WE ALSO MUST ENSURE THAT WE ARE FINALLY INCENTIVIZING WAGE AND BENEFIT INCREASES FOR OUR AYE HSS PROVIDERS. I HSS WORKERS PROVIDE A CRUCIAL SERVICE WHILE SERVING OVER SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND I HSS RECIPIENTS THEY'RE ALSO MAJORITY OF WOMEN OF COLOR WHO MAKE ON AVERAGE ABOUT THIRTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR AND HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO HEALTH AND RETIREMENT BENEFITS. THIS IS LEADING TO A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF AYE HSS PROVIDERS AROUND THE STATE DURING THE TIME WHEN WE NO THE POPULATION OF RECIPIENTS IN NEED OF AYE HSS IS GROWING. SOME WOULD SAY IT IS CRIMINAL THAT THESE PROVIDERS WHO ARE SO IMPORTANT TO KEEPING COUNTLESS CALIFORNIANS LIVING WITH DIGNITY ARE BEING PAID SO LITTLE. ONE HAS TO WONDER IF THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THIS WORKFORCE FOR DIFFERENT WOULD WE STILL BE HAVING TO DISCUSS IN ADEQUATE COMPENSATION AND WOULD WE STILL HAVE TO ENCOURAGE GOOD FAITH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING SO MANY YEARS LATER. REINSTATING XCELERATED CASELOAD GROWTH APPROACH WILL HELP INCENTIVIZE WAGE AND BENEFIT INCREASE FOR THESE PROVIDERS WHO FOR TOO LONG HAVE BEEN DOING INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO WORK FOR LESS THAN A LIVING WAGE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY WOULD COST THE STATE NOTHING. THANK YOU CHRISTINE ABOUT. THIS VERY SIMPLY JUST GETS REALIGNMENT DOLLARS INTO THE HANDS OF COUNTIES AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO SERVER A COMMON ARGUMENT THAT WE HERE AT THE BARGAINING TABLE WHICH IS THEY CAN'T WAIT. THE TRADITIONAL EIGHTEEN MONTH PERIOD IN ORDER TO GET THOSE FUNDS AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY THEY CAN'T DO WAGE INCREASES THANK YOU. THE HIGHER EARLY RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT PROPOSALS APPEAR FROM ADVOCATES I DO GOT TO RAISE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL MORE FROM ADMINISTRATIVE- CONCERN FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCES SIZZLE THIS IS A TV A PROP PROCESS. IN TERMS OF GETTING THE DATA AND THE NETWORK AROUND THE SO ALTHOUGH WE- DON'T HAVE A POSITION AT THE MOMENT WE DO THINK THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME- NEED FOR IT RESOURCES LEASE AT DEPARTMENT FIND SO I HAVE TO CONSULT WITH MY- FOLKS AT CONTROLLER. CONTROL OFFICE ON THIS BUT THIS IS THE VERY TEDIOUS PROCESS IN ORDER TO. BE TO STATUS WITH THAT SO WOULD YOU VERIFY THAT THERE'S COST NEUTRALITY WITH THIS PROPOSAL OR DO YOU THINK THERE IS A COST WITH THIS IN IN THE CONTEXT OF THE REALIGNMENT SHIFT THERE IS NO CAN JUMP ON IMPACT AND THE LIKE THAT IF THERE IS THIS THIS IS ADDITIONAL WORK LOW THAT WILL HAVE TO TAKE UPON AND THAT FOR THE FIRST GOING BACK WOULD BE. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE LAG TIME THAT THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT REGARDING. CASELOAD GROSS AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT- EXACERBATES ISSUES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- MEANT WE- THERE IS A LAG TIME TO THE HOW IT WORKS BUT THIS IS HOW IT'S ALWAYS WORKED FOR. A LONG TIME SINCE SINCE NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT WE DIDN'T MAKE A CHEF. RECENTLY AT ONE WITH THE- WE ADJUST THE JETTA NAME A WEEK THAT THE CCI. BUT WENT BACK TO THE OLD WAYS OF DOING THINGS AND IF. YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IS A LAG TIME. SO RECOGNIZE THAT- BUT OVERALL. THIS OUR REALIGNMENT FUNNY SO THERE IS NO IMPACT ON. A LEASE TO TRY AND SIGN. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FOR E. OPEN AND MOVE ON TO FOR HALF. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I JUST SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE WORKING WITH RECIPIENTS WHO HAVE A DIVERSE ARRAY OF MEDICAL EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL NEEDS FURTHERMORE EACH COUNTY WILL HAVE A SLEW OF REQUIREMENTS WERE EXPECTATIONS FOR EACH IHS US FIGHTER IN ADDITION TO STATE REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS WE WANT TO SET UP OUR EIGHT AYE HSS PROVIDERS FOR SUCCESS WHICH IS WHY WE PASSED SB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN. AS A PILOT PROGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE BILL TO PROVIDERS TO NEGOTIATE THE STRUCTURE TIME AND OF ACCESS TO NEW EMPLOYEE TRAINERS IS CRUCIAL IN ENSURING AYE HSS PROVIDERS ARE RECEIVING THE NECESSARY INFORMATION TO SUCCESS IN THEIR JOBS. I BELIEVE ORIENTATIONS ARE IMPERATIVE TO ANY GROUP SUCCESS THIS IS WHY WHEN WE GET NEW STAFF THEY ARE SENT OFF TO A MYRIAD OF ORIENTATIONS AND TRAININGS AT THE CAPITOL INSTITUTE. OR ONE STUDENT OF STUDENT ENTERS. A NEW COLLEGE UNIVERSITY THEY HAVE DAYS OF ORIENTATION IT'S BECAUSE WE KNOW THE PEOPLE CAN'T BE EXPECTED TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM SYSTEMS WITHOUT THE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION AND TRAINING. THAT IS WHY WE ARE ASKING THE SUCCESSFUL THREE COUNTY PILOT BE MADE PERMANENT AND EXPANDED TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S COUNTIES GIVING PROVIDERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE TO NEGOTIATION. TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE ORIENTATION NEEDS ARE WILL BETTER SUPPORT THEM AND THE AYE HSS RECIPIENTS IN THE LONG RUN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THIS OF BASIC THIS PROPOSAL OF IS VERY BASIC TO EXPAND THE PILOT TO ALL COUNTIES AND MAKE IT PERMANENT BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL THANK YOU. SIMILAR QUESTION AS WE'VE HAD BEFORE CAN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES OR FINANCE VERIFY THE COST NEUTRALITY OF HIS PROPOSED. YEAH THEY'RE BASED ON MY UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE DID WITH THE PILOT THERE IS NO COST TO THE STATE PUTS AN END. KIND OF- MEDICATION EFFORT WILL BE PAID FOR BY THE COUNTIES AND PAY FOR BY LABOR UNIONS AS THEY SEEK BILLS. SERVICES WITH THAT THIS IS WELL RECEIVED AND WILL MOVE ON TO FOUR G. THANK YOU. FINALLY THE INCREASED AS G. IS TO INCREASE THE PENALTY FOR COUNTY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IMPASSES. LAST YEAR WE WERE ABLE OF SORRY WE WERE ENGAGED IN LONG CONVERSATIONS SURROUNDING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IMPASSES BETWEEN COUNTIES AND I HSS PROVIDERS SOME HAD BEEN WITHOUT A NEW CONTRACT FOR SIX YEARS. HOURS OF DISCUSSIONS IN THIS VERY ROOM ON HOW WE WOULD BEST INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES TO ENTERED TO THESE MUCH NEEDED COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH THE IMPERATIVE WORKFORCE THAT IS A TO SAYS I HSS PROVIDERS. OUR CONCLUSION WAS TO ESTABLISH A ONE TIME FISCAL PENALTY OF 1% OF THE COUNTIES I HSS MOE FOR COUNTIES WHO DID NOT ENTER INTO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS PRIOR TO A CERTAIN DATE. UNFORTUNATELY THE STILL VERY LITTLE TO MOVE MOST COUNTIES TO ENTER INTO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WHILE THE STICK VERSUS CARROT APPROACH WOULD BE HELPFUL IN THEORY THE REALITY IS A ONE TIME PENALTY OF THAT SIZE DID NOT WORK AS AN INCENTIVE FOR MANY COUNTIES. IN SOME CASES IT WAS CHEAPER TO PAY THE 1% PENALTY RATHER THAN NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH. THIS IS WHY WE ARE ASKING THAT THE ONE TIME FISCAL PENALTY BE SHIFTED TO AN ANNUAL PENALTY OF M. O. E. THIS WILL HOPEFULLY PUSHED COUNTIES WHO PREVIOUSLY WORKED FINALIZING THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. TO FINALIZE THEM. WE CANNOT KEEP PUSHING OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS FOR A WORKFORCE THAT IS SO CRUCIAL FOR SO MANY CALIFORNIANS IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE TAKE EVERY STEP TO SUPPORT AYE HSS FIGHTERS. IN THE IMPORTANT WORK THEY ARE DOING. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU A- THANK YOU- AGAIN MISTER CHAIR AT EIGHTY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE THIS FROM A HOLISTIC PERSPECTIVE- WE HAVE ACTUATION SO WHERE COUNTIES HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT THEY DO NOT PRIORITIZE I JUST SAYS THEY ACTUALLY BUYS THE FACT THEY HAVE TO I AGES. DON'T BELIEVE FAMILY MEMBERS SHOULD GET PAID FOR DOING I JUST A SERVICES AND THERE'S VERY LITTLE THAT WE CAN DO TO FORCE THEIR HAND IF THEY ARE THE MAJORITY ON THEIR COUNTY BOARDS AND SO IT PUSHES US TO COME TO THE STATE YEAR IN AND YEAR OUT AND CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS I CAN'T COUNT TIMES I'VE BEEN ON THIS THIS I WISH THIS WAS NOT THE SITUATION BUT THIS IS WHERE WE ARE. WE TO MAKE IT CLEAR FROM THE STATE'S PERSPECTIVE THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE COUNTY LEVEL IS NOT ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE WHAT IS HAPPENING IS RESULTING IN A WORK FORCE CRISIS WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOT INCENTIVIZED TO DO THIS WORK BECAUSE THEY CAN GO TO THE IN N. OUT BURGER AND MAKE TWO DOLLARS MORE AN HOUR AND A HALF. BATHS NO ONE IS GOING TO TAKE ON THE JOB AND I JUST SAYS WORKER FOR MINIMUM WAGE UNLESS THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND THEY- DO SO OUT OF THE KINDNESS OF THEIR HEART. AND SO WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS INSURE WITH OUR AGING POPULATION THAT THERE'S ENOUGH FOLKS OUT THERE WILLING TO DO THIS WORK AND THE ONLY WAY YOU DO IT IS BY MAKING THE WAGES COMPETITIVE AT LEAST COMPETITIVE. WITH RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT CREATING A SCENARIO WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE YEARS OF DRAGGING THESE THINGS ON. AND TO CONCLUDE. THE REASON WE HAVE BEEN GETTING SUCCESS IN SOME OF THESE COUNTIES WE HAVE WRAPPED UP A NUMBER OVER THE LAST YEAR IS BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THINGS THAT HAVE HAPPENED. POLITICAL PRESSURE. YOU KNOW I NEED NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT HAVE HAD TO TAKE PLACE AND FEAR THAT WE WILL ACTUALLY GET THIS NEW PENALTY WHICH IS MOTIVATING THEM TO GET THIS STUFF RESULT. YOU SHOULDN'T TAKE BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS TO GET TO THIS POINT THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY AND RESOURCES THAT ARE EXPENDED. WHEN THEY COULD JUST BE INVESTING INTO THE WORK THAT IS FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE IN SOCIETY WE CAN BY PASS ALL OF THIS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU MISS SOMETHING. EIGHT SING THEIR WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK IN REACTION TO THIS PROPOSAL SINCE IT DIRECTLY IMPACTS COUNTIES- ON I THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR HER COMMITMENT DEVICE AS PROVIDER WORKFORCE. AND SPONSORED ALL THESE PROPOSALS. OVERALL COUNTIES REMAIN GRATEFUL FOR THE NEW AND WE STRUCTURE THAT WAS ENACTED LAST YEAR THAT PREVENTED A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF REALIGNMENT SHORTFALL IN ANOTHER MESSAGE THAT CAME ACROSS CLEARLY WITH THAT WAS THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTS AND SEEN AN INCREASED NUMBER. OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH ISAF PROVIDERS AND I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT THAT IS WHAT'S HAPPENING COUNTIES- THE OTHER. COUNTY NARRATIVE THIS OUT THERE THAT I'M SEEN FIRST HAND IS THE COMMITMENT OF A NUMBER OF COUNTY SUPERVISORS TO THIS IMPORTANT PROGRAM. TO PROTECT AND AVAILABLE RESIDENTS INTO MOVING FORWARD- WAGE INCREASES FOR I JUST PROVIDERS THERE'S BEEN FOURTEEN NEW. AGREEMENT SINCE JULY FIRST IS FAR ABOVE THE IN STORE PASTIES ARE AGREEMENTS AND URBAN SUBURBAN AND RURAL COUNTIES FRESNO. THE SAN BERNADINO. RIVERS MARIPOSA HUMBOLDT I'M- COUNTIES- SO COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF REACH NEW AGREEMENTS IT TOTAL COUNTIES ARE INVESTING MORE THAN FORTY MILLION DOLLARS. IN CASH FUNDING WAITING. TO GO TO TAKE EFFECT THIS HAS ON MORE THAN SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS IN NINETEEN INVESTED. FOR WAGE INCREASES THAT WAY THE FACT. HERE STATEWIDE IT WENT OUT A POINT WHERE I NEARLY NINE IN TEN ISIS PROVIDERS WORKING COUNTY THAT HAS A CURRENT AGREEMENT SO WE'RE REALLY PROUD OF THE PROBLEM THE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN MADE. I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE STILL NOT COUNTY WHERE THERE. REMAINS. WERE SO. FULL IN. REACH TO INITIATE BARGAIN. BARGAINING WE HAVE SOME COUNTIES IT TRIED TO REACH ON IT IN ADVANCE OF HAVING AN EXPIRED COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT BUT THE UNION WASN'T READY TO ENGAGE AND THAT'S FINE AND NOW THEY'RE STARTING THOSE NEGOTIATIONS AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL SEE AGREEMENTS THERE. AND THEN THERE ARE SMALL LIMITED NUMBER OF COUNTIES- WITH THIS BEEN ACTIVE- NEGOTIATIONS FOR A NUMBEROF YEARS AND THEY STILL DON'T HAVE AN AGREEMENT- THAT DOESN'T MEAN COUNTY. BARGAINING BAD FAITH. BARGAINING IN GOOD pSTATE WAGES OUR WAGE INCREASES THERE DOES NOT THE OFFERS THAT UM. THE UNION. KENYAN SO THERE'S SOME DISAGREEMENT THERE BETWEEN WHAT'S BEING OFF ON IT SO. THERE IS A- FOR THAT PLAY OUT WHAT WE KNOW. LAST YEAR IT'S A FOR STEP. COUNTY HAS A AN X. AGREEMENT THEY MUST GO TO MEDIATE. FACT FINDING- THERE'D FACTFINDER MUST YOU RECOMMEND. MORE FAVORABLE TO THE UNION AND THE NEXT NINETY DAYS TO REACH A FINAL AGREEMENT. FOR COUNTIES THAT WEREN'T ALREADY IT IMPACTS PRIDE THE NEW. WE HAPPENED YET TEST THIS. OR ONLY IT STEP ONE OF FOUR. AND IS VERY. AMOUNT OF CASH THAT MAKE THEIR- WE THINK THAT PROCESS. HAS IT TO WORK AS A TO. PROVIDE COUNTY. TOLD GET TO AN ANGRY. AND WE WOULD. STRONGLY WAS INCREASING THE PEN AMOUNT. THE PRICE HAS. EVEN TO. AND I GUESS THE OTHER I WOULD SAY IS I BELIEVE THERE WOULD. A FOR COSTS OF THIS FROM I THINK THE ADVOCATES. INDICATE THAT THE- OF ALL THOSE TWO IN. THE OF COLLECTIVE. AGREEMENTS AND IF HAPPENS EVERY TIME. COUNTIES INCREASE WAY TO THERE IS JUST GENERAL FOR COSCO THE STATE PAY A PART OF THE AS WELL SO JUST IN TERMS OF CAN. OF THE PROPOSED WE BELIEVE VIA. ACOSTA WHICH IS NOT A- ME. IN THIS ONE THOUSAND TIMES I WISH NOW THAT I'M WITH THAT THANK YOU FOR CONSIDERATION. DEPARTMENT LA AND THEY THOUGHT. YOU KNOW IF I pI THIS NEEDS TO AND INTO THE COLLECT BARGAINING SPACE AND GET US A WAVE FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT IN A- AND BORDER SUPER AND SO WHAT ENCOURAGE US PART. AS WE MOVED A NEW WAY WE OUR OLD FUN THE FOR THE STATE TO RECONSIDER THE PROPOSAL AND THAT MAY HELP TO ALLEVIATE OF THE CONCERNS AM. APPRECIATIVE THAT IT TOOK. THE LETTERS WORK THOUGH GETTING ARRESTED FOR FRESNO COUNTY TO RECEIVE AN A CONTRACT. BUT I DO THINK WE HAVE TO DO MORE SO THAT COUNTIES LIKE KERN AND COUNTIES THROUGHOUT. THE STATE ARE ABLE TO DO IT I AM APPRECIATIVE THAT NINE OUT OF TEN. LACES I HSS WORKERS ARE NOW IN CURRENT CONTRACTS THAT IS MOVING THE NEEDLE FORWARD FROM WHERE WE WERE LAST YEAR- BUT WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE. FOUR G. OPEN FOR NOW AND WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AGAIN ON ALL PROPOSALS UNDER ISSUE FOR THIS TIME. I'M JUST TRYIN- BE SPECIFIC IF YOU CAN REGARDING WHICH PROPOSAL IT'S ON. JEFF TORTILLA I NOT RECEIVE I US BECAUSE THERE IS MUCH PAPERWORK TO START IT OUT. HOPEFULLY THAT WILL IMPROVE BUT THIS NEEDS TO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE HE POPULATION THAT'S NEEDED THE NEEDS ARE FAR GREATER THAN YOU WHICH YOU HAVE THE JOB POPULATION. THANK YOU SIR. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS HAVE ANYONE WITH THAT THE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA ON BEHALF OF OUR THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND LONG TERM CARE MEMBERS IN SUPPORT OF ALL ISSUE ITEMS UNDER NUMBER FOUR EIGHT THREE G. I WOULD ONLY LIKE TO NOTE- THAT WE HAVE PUT IN A RECOMMENDATION TO THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING FOR STATEWIDE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND WHAT ALSO NOTE THAT LASSEN IS THE ONLY COUNTY THAT TOLD US DIRECTLY THAT THEY WOULD RATHER JUST PAY THE PENALTY.

UNLESS THIS INCREASE IS PART OF THE BUDGET THIS YEAR AND IN THE YEARS AHEAD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM.

I BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE OBVIOUS BUT THIS ISSUE. IS IMPORTANT FOR ALL FOR US ALL TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE LAST MAJOR CUTS THE STATE MADE DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. THAT WE HAVE YET TO RESTORE. AS EACH YEAR PASSES THE IMPACT OF THIS CUT. COMPOUNDS ON ITSELF MAKING IT MORE MORE DIFFICULT FOR SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES NOT JUST AFFORD TO LIVE BUT TO SURVIVE. RECIPIENTS FIND FAR BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL AND FACING SERIOUS AND LIFE CHANGING DECISIONS ON HOW TO PAY FOR DAY TO DAY LIVING EXPENSES RENT. FOOD MEDICATION ELECTRICITY AND SO ON. IN FACT SS I SS BE RECIPIENTS WERE ALREADY NEAR HOMELESS BEFORE THESE CUTS WERE MADE. AND THIS CUT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE ARE FACING A HOMELESSNESS CRISIS TODAY ESPECIALLY AMONGST OUR SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. WITHOUT AN INCREASE IN SB GRANT THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL CONTINUE TO FACE A GREATER RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS AND FACE HUNGER AND POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES. WE SHOULD NOT WAIT CANNOT WAIT HAS BEEN MORE THAN TEN YEARS. IT IS TIME TO SIX NEVER CAN STEP RESTORE THE STATE'S SHARE THE SS I SS P. AND NOT ALLOWED TO BECOME AN ACCEPTED REALITY OF THE BUDGET.

BRO WHICH IS THE HOMELESS VOUCHERS THAT IS PAID FOR BY THE FRESNO CITY. I WAS PUT ON THAT VOUCHER IN TWO THOUSAND DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN. DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN. MY RENT INCREASED WHICH I CANNOT AFFORD. AS SO I HAD TO END UP MOVING AGAIN. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN MY SS I WAS ALSO TAKEN AWAY BECAUSE I WASN'T PAYING THE RENT. I WASN'T PAYING RENT BECAUSE I WAS HOMELESS DURING THAT TIME. I'M STILL FIGHTING TO GET THAT IS A SITE BACK TODAY. SINCE MY EXPERIENCE WITH HOMELESSNESS I BECAME AN ACTIVIST AND AN ADVOCATE TOO MANY LIVING ON THE STREETS AND IN POOR LOW INCOME HOUSING. MANY OF THESE BEING ON SSI. I HAVE WORKED WITH AROUND FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR ABOUT TO BECOME HOMELESS OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS OF MY ADVOCACY. AND I WOULD SAY ABOUT HALF OF THEM ARE ON SSI. IF I GET MY AS A SIDE BACK HIM FOR THE PEOPLE I WORK WITH IT WILL HELP US WITH BASIC NECESSITIES SUCH AS FOOD TRANSPORTATION AND MEDICATION. THESE ARE THINGS WE ALL NEED BUT MANY OF US ARE GOING WITHOUT. AS OF TODAY I AM RECOVERING FROM SURGERY I HAVE FIVE DAYS AGO THIS WAS BROUGHT ON BY HEART ATTACKS. I HAD THESE WITHIN THE LAST YEAR. I HAVE MANY MORE TESTS TO COMPLETE IF I GET. I AS A SIDE BACK PLUS AN INCREASE OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS I CAN POSSIBLY PAY AND CATCH UP ON MY COPAYMENT FEES AND GET SOME OF THE MEDS THAT I HAVE NOT EVEN BEEN PICKING UP. AS OF APRIL TWENTY TWENTY I WILL BE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AGAIN NOT BECAUSE I WANT TO. BUT BECAUSE MY RENT INCREASE FROM SEVEN SEVENTY WHICH IS MY VOUCHER. TWO NINE SEVENTY FIVE.

GOOD EVENING LISA COLEMAN WITH CAL COMMA. AND WE GO BACK TO WE'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THIS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM AT THE I'M ASSOCIATION IS VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THE PATCH. WHEN WE ARE ASKING PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE- ASSISTED LIVING SERVICES. AT THE NON MEDICAL OUT OF HEALTH POCKET BUT A THOUSAND SIXTY NINE DOLLARS A MONTH. WE ARE ENCOURAGING FACILITY ADMINISTRATORS TO CUT CORNERS WE ARE ENCOURAGING THEM TO SKIRT PASSED THE LAW. WE WILL ULTIMATELY FIND THE SAME RESIDENTS AND SKILLED NURSING. STILL ON MEDI CAL BUT AT A MUCH HIGHER RATE OF REIMBURSEMENT. IT IS EXPENSIVE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT I GO BACK TO YOUR POINT BEFORE WE WILL PAY FOR THIS ONE WE ARE ANOTHER ENCOURAGES TO LOOK AT THIS IS THE IDEA OF RESPECT AND DIGNITY AND INCREASE THE PATCH. THANK YOU MA'AM SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE SIX. I WILL BRING IT BACK FORWARD AND- AGAIN WANTS TO APPRECIATE DOES MARTINEZ FOR COMING TO SHARE YOUR STORY AS MANY. PEOPLE HERE OF SHARED YOUR STORY- I BELIEVE LAST TIME I SAW YOU WE WERE AT MY CHURCH TGETHER AND- SPEAKING ON A HOMELESS PANEL- BEFORE THE ACLU SO. JUST WANT TO RECOGNIZE YOU FOR TAKING TIME. I DID WANT TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IF I COULD JUST TO PROVIDE SOME FEEDBACK ON THE PROPOSAL- AND IT ANY SUGGESTIONS YOU MAY PROVIDE. HOUSE AT THE AMY DIFFERENT FINANCE AS WAS MENTIONED THIS IS A VERY. COSTLY PROPOSAL- EVERYONE PERCENT INCREASE THIS AMOUNT TO TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS. AND GENERAL FUND COSTS. SO NO JUST STATING THE FACTS ENTRANCE OF THE FISCAL IT THAT WHERE WE ARE AT THE MOMENT WITH THE SITUATION- BUT IF TO ACCEPT THAT THAT IS A PRIORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE. HAPPY TO PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. I'M I GUESS TO ADD MORE SPECIFICITY TO THE QUESTION WE'VE CURRENTLY- PUT IN. TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT THE COAL- FOR S. S. P. IS TO START IN TWENTY TWO. TWENTY THREE AND I GUESS MY QUESTION IS ARE ARE WE ADEQUATELY BUDGETING FOR PARENTS FOR THAT- AND- WHEN WOULD THAT NEED TO BE REFLECTED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND- SO. THE LANGUAGE SO IT SAYS THAT SUBJECT IN PREPARATION SO BASED OFF OF OUR CURRENT BUDGET ARCHITECT WE DON'T MAKE ANY ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT- FUNDING TO ANY KIND OF COAL IS AT THE MOMENT- ORGAN AT THE WEIGHT AND- TELL THEM TO SEE WHAT THE REVENUES LOOK LIKE. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE IS A CAPACITY WITH. REVENUES TO DO SO WILL HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. I'M I BRING IT UP BECAUSE I'M QUITE SENSITIVE TO THE COMPOUNDING NATURE OR THAT THE LACK OF THE COAL- HAS HAD IN TERMS OF CONTINUING TO GROW THAT DIVIDE AND. BUT WANTED JUST TO MENTION THAT- THIS COMMITTEE IS TRYING TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARDS ESTABLISHING THE COLA- WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SIX A OPEN AND APPRECIATE ASSEMBLYMEMBER CALL FOR BRINGING UP FOR. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ISSUE SIX BE. THANK. GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS HIS PROPOSAL MY NAME IS GONNA SEE LEGACY- CRANKS AND I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF GRIFFIN STEVENS AND THE CONSULTING WHO REPRESENTS THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA UNDER THE CURRENT LAW A STATE ME ADMINISTER ITS OWN STATE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT OR ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE FEDERAL SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION PAYMENTS AND PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE. IF SSA ADMINISTERS THE PROGRAM THE STATE MUST PAY PER TRANSACTION A FEE THAT IS ADJUSTED ANNUALLY AND INCREASED FOR INFLATION FOR FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THE ADMINISTRATIVE FEE IS TWELVE DOLLARS AND FORTY ONE CENTS PER TRANSACTION THIS MEANS THAT CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY PAYS A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. ENTER THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA. AUTHORIZE THE STATE TREASURY AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WELFARE TO ASSUME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PROCESSING THEIR OWN S. S. P. PAYMENT PROGRAM. THE PAYMENTS WERE PREVIOUSLY AS ME ADMINISTERED BY SSA. THIS HAS BEEN A COST SAVING MEASURE TO THE STATE AND NOW BASED ON ITS SUCCESS THEY ACTUALLY HAD A LEGISLATION PASSED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN AUTHORIZING THE STATE THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT IN PENNSYLVANIA TO ENTER INTO CONTRACTS WITH OTHER STATES. THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA IS TO WOULD LIKE TO ENGAGE WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND OFFER THE SERVICES AND PROVIDE THE ABILITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO SAVE MONEY BY HAVING THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA ADMINISTER THE SS BE PROGRAM. SO WHAT THE PROPOSAL THAT WE ARE BRINGING FORTH WOULD BASICALLY. CHANGE CURRENT LANGUAGE RIGHT NOW UNDER EXISTING LAW DSS HOUSE TO CONTRACT WITH THE UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TO MAKE THE PAYMENTS. THE PROPOSAL THAT WE ARE PUSHING FORWARD IS BASICALLY LANGUAGE THAT WOULD SIMPLY AUTHORIZE BUT NOT REQUIRE DSS TO CONTRACT WITH EITHER AS A STATE OR ANOTHER STATE THAT IS CAPABLE OF ACTUALLY HANDLING THE SERVICE. THIS AUTHORIZATION WOULD ONLY COME INTO PLAY IF THE STATE MADE THE DETERMINATION THAT CONTRACTING WITH ANOTHER STATE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO CALIFORNIA AND TO THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. DSS DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE SIX BE. SEEING NONE I'LL BRING IT BACK- FOR THE SPONSORS IF I MAY CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT EFFECT THIS WOULD HAVE FOR RECIPIENTS. WELL ONCE IF CALIFORNIA DECIDED TO PURSUE THIS TYPE OF A CONVERSATION WITH THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA PENNSYLVANIA WOULD HAVE TO MAKE MORE OF AN ANALYSIS AS TO THE TYPE OF INFORMATION THEY WOULD NEED AND CARRY FORWARD BUT THE IDEA WOULD BE THAT THE ACTUAL- TRANSITION WOULD SEEM BE SEAMLESS AND THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA WOULD ASSUME ALL UP FRONT COST. AND TO JUST MAKE SURE AGAIN IF THIS IS IT MOST OF THIS IS DONE ELECTRONICALLY SO IF ALL OF THAT IS FIGURED OUT THE IDEA WOULD BE THAT ONCE PENNSYLVANIA FOR EXAMPLE HOUSE ALL OF THE ACCOUNTS AND DEPOSITING INTO THAT. TO THE BANK ACCOUNTS NOTHING WOULD MOVE FORWARD UNTIL TESTS WERE RUN TO ENSURE THAT THE BENEFICIARIES WOULD NOT BE IMPACTED. I THINK MY QUESTION IS REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD RECEIVE ONE CHECKER TOO. THEY WOULD RECEIVE TWO CHECKS THEY WOULD BASICALLY RECEIVE ONE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND ONE. FROM CALIFORNIA. SO PERCEPTION FROM THE RECIPIENTS MAY BE THAT THERE- THAT THERE THAT IT WENT DOWN BUT THE REALITY BEING TWO CHECKS WOULD TOTAL THE SAME AS WAS BEFORE THAT IS CORRECT. BASED ON THIS DOES THE DEPARTMENT OR FINANCE HAVE ANY COMMENTS REGARDING THIS PROPOSAL. NOT AT THIS TIME I KNOW WHAT YOU'E NOT ANALYSIS WE'RE LOOKING AT IT WE'RE TALKING TO FOLKS BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SUGGEST AT THIS TIME. YEAH GIVEN THAT IT'S- POTENTIAL STATE SAVINGS I MAY ASK. TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE- AN APPROPRIATE ANALYSIS FROM. BOTH DEPARTMENT SO THAT WE CAN- AND SEE IF THIS IS A WAY WE COULD. HELP TO REINVEST IT WOULD BE APPRECIATED SO. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SIX BE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE SEVEN. THANK YOU. OUR BEING JOINED BY ANOTHER MEMBER OF OUR STAFF JUST GIVE US A CALL OKAY. WE SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH CHAIRS FRANK IF YOU WANNA COME FORWARD. THIS OKAY I'M WITH THAT I AM HERE TODAY TO ASK THIS COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE A HUNDRED MILLION IN STATE FUNDS ON AN ONGOING BASIS FOR THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM AS WE HAVE HEARD THE AGING POPULATION IS GROWING IN THAT HAS HAD A DIRECT IMPACT ON LOCAL APS PROGRAMS THIS POPULATION COMES WITH COMPLEX HEALTH NEEDS NOT ONLY ARE THEY OLDER THEY ARE ALSO VULNERABLE DUE TO TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES AND DEMENTIA AND A GROWING NUMBER ARE HAVE BEEN FINANCIALLY EXPLOITED. COUPLED THAT WITH CALIFORNIA'S UNPRECEDENTED HOUSING CRISIS AND THE RESEARCH OUT OF UCSF BY DOCTOR MARGOT CRUCIAL SHOWS THAT ADULTS OVER AGE FIFTY ARE THE FASTEST GROWING COHORT OF HOMELESS ADULTS WITH NEARLY HALF BECOMING HOMELESS AFTER THE AGE OF FIFTY. CLEARLY CALIFORNIA HAS REACHED A BOILING POINT IN OUR HOUSING CRISIS AND WE TRULY NEED A MULTI FACETED APPROACH AND ONE THAT BUILT ON OUR EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS LIKE A PS. THIS APS PROGRAM HAS A PROVEN RECORD OF SUCCESS IN SERVING OUR HOMELESS POPULATION AND THIS PROGRAM HAS EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE KNOWS HOW TO WORK WITH OLDER ADULTS WHO HAVE COMPLEX NEEDS. AND WORKS WITH PARTNERS ACROSS DIFFERENT AGENCIES INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE PUBLIC GUARDIAN. THIS PROPOSAL HAS THREE COMPONENTS WHICH WILL BE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAILS BY OUR PRESENTERS. THANK YOU GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS PAUL DONE AWAY AND I'M THE DIVISION DIRECTOR OF ADULT NEEDING SERVICES AND SONOMA COUNTY WHICH IS A PART OF THE HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT THANK YOU. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND A COALITION OF STAKEHOLDERS TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO REDUCE OLDER ADULTS HOMELESSNESS BY EXPANDING AND ENHANCING THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES PROGRAM. WE ARE REQUESTING A HUNDRED MILLION ONGOING STATE FUNDS. THIS PROPOSAL TARGETS FUNDING IN SEVERAL KEY WAYS. INCREASED STAFFING WILL ALLOW FOR LONGER TERM CASE MANAGEMENT AND FOR CASE WORKERS TO INTERVENE WHETHER MOST VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS AT AN EARLIER POINT HELPING TO AVERT SOME OF THE MORE DIFFICULT AND MORE COSTLY CRISIS SITUATIONS. DOLLARS INVESTED IN A HOME SAFE PROGRAMS WILL DIRECTLY SERVE THOSE IN OUR PROGRAM WHO ARE FACING HOMELESSNESS. IT WILL ALSO HELP ALL COUNTIES TO CREATE CROSS SYSTEM TEAMS THAT WORK CLOSELY WITH LOCAL PARTNERS TO TACKLE THE MOST COMPLEX CASES. AT THE TIME THE APS WAS ESTABLISHED OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO THE OLDER ADULT POPULATION WASN'T WHAT IT IS TODAY. IN CINEMA COUNTY OLDER ADULTS MAKE UP. MORE THAN. ONE QUARTER OF THE TOTAL POPULATION. IT'S PROJECTED THE CALIFORNIA OLDER ADULTS OLDER ADULTS WILL SURPASS THOSE OF MINORS IN THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY SIX. THAT HAPPENED IN CINEMA COUNTY IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN AND THAT'S TWENTY FIVE YEARS AHEAD OF THE PROJECTED TIME FRAME. AND I KNOW THAT SONOMA COUNTY IS NOT ALONE. THE INDIVIDUALS THAT WE ARE SAYING HAVE MORE COMPLEX NEEDS AND NEED MORE HELP THAN WE CAN GIVE THEM. THE CURRENT FUNDING WHICH IS MOSTLY COUNTY REALIGNMENT DOES NOT COVER THE DRAMATIC INCREASES IN POPULATION WITH GREATER COMPLEXITIES. WE'RE ALSO IN CONSTANT COMPETITION FOR THIS FINITE RESOURCE. LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA RECEIVED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND REPORTS OF ABUSE TO OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE DISABILITIES. CINEMA COUNTY HAS SEEN A 46% INCREASE BETWEEN THE YEARS OF TO THOR TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND THAT'S JUST FIVE YEAR TIME. THE COMPLEXITY OF CASES CAN BE MEASURED IN THE NUMBER OF ALLEGATIONS. CINEMA COUNTY SAW 37% INCREASE IN IN ALLEGATIONS IN THE SAME TIME FRAME. SO MY COUNTY APPLIED FOR AND RECEIVED FUNDING TO ADMINISTER THE HOME SAFE PROGRAM WHICH STARTED IN JULY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN NINETEEN. EIGHT MONTHS IN WE HAVE NOW SERVED SIXTY INDIVIDUALS AND HAVE MANY SUCCESS STORIES. I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ONE OF THAT OF LAND. LYNN IS A SIXTY ONE YEAR OLD DEPENDENT ADULT WHO IS NON AMBULATORY AFTER SUPPER- SUFFERING A DISABLING STROKE MANY YEARS AGO. LYNN WENT THROUGH A DIVORCE HAD TO SELL OUR HOME AND EVENTUALLY FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY. AFTER UNDERGOING INTENSIVE REHABILITATION SHE MOVED IN WITH A FRIEND. IT WAS A PLACE TO LIVE BUT FAILED TO MEET YOUR BASIC NEEDS. SHE MOVED INTO A HOTEL SPENDING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS. OVER THE COURSE OF SEVERAL YEARS A. P. S. HAD A NUMBER OF REPORTS ONLINE. AFTER HOME SAFE WAS IMPLEMENTED LYNN WAS ASSIGNED A SPECIALIZED WORKER IN THIS PROGRAM. WITH A COMBINATION OF KEY CONTRACT SUPPORT PROVIDERS LIKE LEGAL ASSISTANCE. A BUDGET TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR LARGE EXPENSES LIKE SECURITY DEPOSITS AND RENTAL PAYMENTS. LOWER CASE LOADS AND LONGER TERM CASE MANAGEMENT HOME SAFE IS A SUCCESS FOR HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE AND STILL IN ITS YEAR AND ITS FIRST YEAR OF ACTIVITY. WHEN IS NOW LIVING IN INAPPROPRIATE HOUSING TO MEET HER NEEDS AND HAS A CARETAKER. QUANTIFYING THE COST SAVINGS COMPARED TO LAND BEING HOMELESS MAY BE IMPOSSIBLE BUT THIS IS ONE PERSON WHO IS OVERCOMING SERIOUS CHALLENGES AND NOW IT DOESN'T HAVE TO ADD THE CHALLENGE OF BEING HOMELESS. SERVICES IS ALREADY CHALLENGING EXISTING RESOURCES. ONE CONSEQUENCES INCREASED ORDERED ALL POPULATION LIVING WITHOUT A HOME. APS IS A KEY PARTNER IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE THIS FUNDING WILL KEEP THAT SUPPORT AVAILABLE AS WE CONTINUE PARTNERING WITH OTHER SAFETY NET SERVICES. WE BELIEVE THAT FINDING A PS PROGRAM IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESSING BOTH THE ISSUES OF OLDER DAHLE HOMELESSNESS AND THE GROWTH IN OLDER ADULT POPULATIONS THAT CALIFORNIA'S FACING. WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT.

GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CONNIE DEMAND AND I AM IN A RP VOLUNTEER. ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA'S THREE POINT THREE MILLION MEMBERS AGE FIFTY AND OVER WE'RE GLAD TO SUPPORT THE AUGMENTATION TO APS. THIS REQUEST INCLUDES INNOVATIVE APPROACHES THAT WILL ALLOW A PS TO DEAL WITH POTENTIAL CHALLENGES FOR AT RISK POPULATIONS. MOST NOTABLY IT WOULD LOWER THE ELIGIBILITY AGE FOR A PS FROM SIXTY FIVE TO SIXTY TO MATCH ELIGIBILITY IN THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT. IT WOULD ON MEN AND EXPAND THE HOME SAFE PROGRAM BEYOND ITS CURRENT COUNTIES AND ENHANCE THE TOOLS TO ASSIST THOSE AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS AND ENACT LONG TERM MULTI DISCIPLINARY CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES NEEDED FOR MORE INTENSIVE CASES. AS CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION OF OLDER ADULTS CONTINUES TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE APS SERVICE THOSE WHO ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO PREMATURE DEATH% THROUGH ABUSE AND NEGLECT. AS WE KNOW APS WORKERS PROVIDE FRONTLINE RESPONSE TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK AND MUST BE PROPERLY TRAINED TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS ON COMPLEX CASES.

INITIAL COUNTIES FOR THE PILOT. SO THE HOME SAFE PROGRAM ISN'T% ADMINISTERED OUT OF OUR DIVISION BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY- GET THAT INFORMATION AND PROVIDE IT TO YOU.
