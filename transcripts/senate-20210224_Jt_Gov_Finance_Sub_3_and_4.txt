IN BIG CITIES AND SMALL HOMELESS RESIDENTS SLEEP ON THE STREETS EVERY NINE. HUNDRED FIFTY ONE THOUSAND RESIDENTS. LIVE ON THE STREETS EACH DAY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MORE THAN ANY STATE IN THE NATION. AND AS I SAID BEFORE AND I THINK THAT ALL OF YOU AGREE IT'S SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. IT'S DISGRACEFUL AND IS THE FAILURE OF GOVERNMENT AT ALL LEVELS. THE COBY NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS MADE THE SITUATION ON OUR STREETS EVEN WORSE. AS RESIDENTS OFTEN HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO THE SERVICES AND SUPPLIES THEY NEED TO STAY HEALTHY. IN ADDITION A RECENT REPORT BY THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE HAS HIGHLIGHTED SERIOUS CONCERNS SERIOUS CONCERNS AT ALL LEVELS OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT ABOUT IT JUST JOINTED APPROACH TACKLING THIS CRISIS. EVEN THOUGH THERE HAS BEEN RECORD RESOURCES INVESTED IT'S BEEN HIGHLIGHTED THAT THE STATE AND LOCAL RESPONSE IS BEING HAMPERED BECAUSE AND I QUOTE THERE IS NO SINGLE ENTITY. IN CALIFORNIA OVERSEEN EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND THERE ISN'T A SINGLE STATEWIDE STRATEGIC PLAN. FURTHER THE AUDITORS REPORT STATES THAT LOCAL AGENCIES SERVING HOMELESS DO NOT KEEP TRACK OF WHERE THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT ARE BEING INVESTED. ARE INVESTED IN. THE FAILED TO FOLLOW FEDERAL GUIDELINES IN DON'T TRACK OUTCOMES. NINE BILLION SEES CONCERNS THIS MORNING NOT AS IN A GOTCHA BUT BECAUSE THE STAKES ARE SO HIGH. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HUMAN LIVES. ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT ARE MOVING FAST TO TACKLE THIS CRISIS. IN THE AUDIT DOES ADVANCE POINTS THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT. END I'M A FIRM BELIEVER THAT ALL INVOLVED IN THIS FIGHT ARE DOING THIS BECAUSE THEY WANT BETTER OUTCOMES. THE ONE INEFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO TACKLE THE CRISIS WE WANT A CONSISTENT APPROACH FROM TOP TO BOTTOM. AND THEY WANT TAXPAYER MONEY TO BE INVESTED SMARTLY. THROUGH THIS HEARING INTO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE COMMITTEE CHAIRS IN THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WE'RE GOING TO DIG DEEPLY THIS MORNING. INTO RECENT STATE AND LOCAL EFFORTS HAD TO BE TO COMBAT THE CRISIS THE CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS IN FOCUS ON THE PARTICULAR CHALLENGES. FISHING AT FACING TRANSITION AGE YOUTH THE COMMITTEES WILL FIRST RECEIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS DURING THE PANDEMIC. AND THEIR PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGH AT THREE TWO. PROJECTS PROJECT ROOM KEY AND HOME KEY SECOND THE COMMITTEES WILL HEAR FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE ADOPTED STRATEGIES TO CONFRONT HOMELESSNESS IN ADDRESS THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION. DURING THIS PANDEMIC FINALLY THE COMMITTEES WILL HEAR FROM DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS AND INDIVIDUALS WITH- TRUE EXPERIENCE AND WHAT IS AND IS NOT WORKING WHEN IT COMES TO THE SPECIFIC CHALLENGES. TRANSITION AGE YOUTH FACE WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM EACH OF OUR PANELISTS NOW AND TURN IT OVER TO EACH OTHER COMMITTEE CHAIRS. THE START US OUT WITH OPENING COMMENTS WE'RE NOW GOING TO YIELD THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR WIENER CHAIR OF THE SENATE HOUSING COMMITTEE. MISTER CHAIR. GOOD MORNING THE FLOOR'S YOURS. BY THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS CHAIRMAN AND YOU FOR ALL US WORKING TOGETHER. ON AND FOR- YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS AND OF COURSE COVE IT HAS SHOWN A HUGE LIGHT. ON SO MANY PRE EXISTING PROBLEMS ARE LARGELY NOT NEW PROBLEMS ARE PROBLEMS OF ALWAYS BEEN WITH US- AND NOW THEY'RE EITHER JUST GETTING WORSE OR THERE ARE MORE VISIBLE- AND THE QUESTION FOR US IS- AS WE MOVE PASSAGE PANDEMIC WHICH WE WILL. ARE GOING TO GO BACK TO THE OLD BAD NORMAL OR WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT IT TAKES- TO SOLVE. THESE PROBLEMS THAT AGAIN HAVE BEEN FESTERING FOR MANY MANY MANY MANY YEARS- AND ARE NOW BEING SHOWN FOR WHAT THEY ARE AND THE HARM THAT THEY'RE CAUSING INTO CALIFORNIANS. EVERY DAY AND AMONG THOSE- IS HOUSING AND WE SEE THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE WITH. PEOPLE STILL CAN'T AFFORD HOUSING HOUSING IS STILL INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE IN SOME WAYS MORE EXPENSIVE. PEOPLE ARE STILL GETTING AFFECTED AND BECOMING HOMELESS- AND ARE HOMELESS- NEIGHBORS ARE ARE BECOMING SADLY MORE NUMEROUS- THAN THEY WERE. BEFORE AND I KNOW THAT A BIG FOCUS IS THAT HEARING- AND I SUPPORT THIS IS THE TRIAGE. OF HELPING PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS WHETHER THEY'RE ON OUR STREETS LIVING IN CARS- COUCHSURFING- OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE WITH THE TRIAGE. OF HELPING GETTING THEM STABILIZE AND THE HOUSING. THAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. BUT WE ALSO AS WE DO THAT WE CAN NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF WHY IT IS A CALIFORNIA HAS SO MANY HOMELESS PEOPLE. CALIFORNIA HAS COUNTRY THIRTEEN PERCENT. BY POPULATION AND A MAJORITY OF THE NATION'S UNSHELTERED HOMELESS POPULATION. 13% OF THE POPULATION IS COUNTRY BUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. OF THE NATION'S HOMELESS POPULATION AND A MAJORITY. OF THE UNSHELTERED HOMELESS POPULATION I SAID THAT TWICE BECAUSE IT IS SHOCKING AND APPALLING. AND IT'S NOT JUST RANDOM. THAT WE HAVE SUCH A DISPROPORTIONATE HOMELESS POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA COMPARED THE REST OF THE COUNTRY THAT IS RANDOMLY HAPPENED. IT WAS AN ACT OF GOD IT WASN'T JUST RANDOM IT WAS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA. IT HAS A PROFOUND HOUSING SHORTAGE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS HAD ADOPTED AN AWFUL HOUSING POLICY OVER THE LAST FIFTY YEARS. WE DECIDED THAT IT'S NOT A PRIORITY TO HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED IT AND NOT JUST PUSHES EVERYONE DOWN IT MEANS THAT FAMILIES THAT USED TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO BUY A HOME CAN'T AFFORD TO BUY A HOME ANYMORE MEANS OF FAMILIES AND MAY HAVE HAD A LARGE ENOUGH APARTMENT FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR FIVE. NOW HAVE A VERY SMALL APARTMENT OR HAVE TO DOUBLE UP WITH OTHER FAMILIES. SENATE MEANS THAT PEOPLE WHO IN THE PAST WILL BE ABLE TO AT LEAST AFFORD SOME SORT OF APARTMENT WHETHER IT'S A SINGLE ROOM OR A SMALL APARTMENT- OR WITH A ROOMMATE. ARE NOW LIVING IN CARS OR COUCH SURFING OR ON THE STREETS OR IN A HOMELESS SHELTER IT PUSHES EVERYONE DOWN- AND SO AS WE WORK ON THIS TRIAGE. TO HELP GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS. LET'S KEEP IN MIND ALWAYS AT THE BROADER WORK THAT WE'RE DOING IN THE SENATE IN THIS LEGISLATURE ON HOUSING- ONE ON TRYING TO SPUR THE PRODUCTION OF MORE HOUSING. WHEN TRYING TO REMOVE THE OBSTACLES TO HAVING ENOUGH HOUSING. THAT THAT TIES DIRECTLY. INTO PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE IT IS MUCH BETTER TO PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING. THEN THEY HAVE TO TRIAGE. ONCE IT'S HAPPENED SO IT'S ALWAYS REMEMBER THAN A CONNECTION THAT'S WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT THIS HEARING NUMBER INTER CONNECTING EVERYTHING. AND FINALLY I JUST WANT TO NOTE% THAT I'M REALLY THRILLED THAT WE ARE LOOKING SPECIFICALLY. AROUND HOMELESSNESS AND AMONG OUR MOST AT RISK YOUTH. ARE HOMELESS. YOUTH YOUTH EXITING THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM YOUTH EXITING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM- WE KNOW THAT MOST CALIFORNIA COUNTIES DO NOT EVEN HAVE YOU SPECIFIC HOMELESS PROGRAMS. WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET MORE RESOURCES OVER THE YEARS FROM THE STATE I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT WORK. WE'RE TAKING ANOTHER RUN AT IT THIS YEAR. WITH A SPECIFIC SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT HOUSING FOR MOST AT RISK YOUTH- FOR TO DISCUSSIONS TODAY TO THE WORK I HAD THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MISTER SENATOR IN FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE. AND CENTER WIENER BROUGHT UP A GREAT POINT WE HAVE EVERY COMMITTEE WHETHER IT'S THE FISCAL. END OR THE POLICY HERE IN ONE ROOM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SPEAKING THAT WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO SENATOR ACHING. SHE IS THE CHAIRWOMAN FOR SENATE BUDGET BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE THREE FOCUS ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BETTER CHAIR IT IS AN HONOR TO PARTNER WITH YOU. ON THIS CRITICAL HEARING THANK. YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK TO FLOOR IS YOURS MA'AM. THANK YOU MUCH. SENATOR THANK YOU FOR LEADING THIS TODAY I THANK ALL OF MY SENATORS FOR BEING HERE. AND EVERYBODY WHO WILL BE MAKING A PRESENTATION- SO I GIVE BLOOD MY PROFESSION HAS BEEN AS A SOCIAL WORKER ANDIN TEACHING ABOUT SOCIAL WORK WE ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THE RIVER RIGHT AND I THINK AT THIS POINT RIGHT NOW. WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE POINT WHERE WE ARE JUST TRYING TO PULL AS MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE DROWNING OUT OF THE RIVER AS WE POSSIBLY CAN IT IS EXHAUSTING. OUR SYSTEM WAS NOT DESIGNED IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT WHEN WE WENT TO HOLD LIKE LET'S LET'S LET'S CREATE A WHOLE SHELTER SYSTEM. THAT WAS ANOTHER BANDAID TO A LARGER ISSUE RIGHT I MEAN DEVELOPING MORE SHELTERS. SHOULD NOT BE OUR GOAL OF FINDING PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO LIVE IN A IN A MORE PERMANENT FAMILY COMMUNITY STRUCTURE. SHOULD BE OUR GOAL AND AS LONG AS WE KEEP JUST PULLING PEOPLE OUT OF THE RIVER VERSUS GOING UPSTREAM. AND IDENTIFYING WHY SO MANY ARE FALLING IN. IT WILL WE'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO TRULY MAKE. GAINS ON THIS ISSUE- I COME AT THIS FROM BOTH A- WE NEED TO DEVELOP MORE HOUSING AND IF YOU JUST THINK ABOUT. THE ANALOGYOF A BUYING IN BUK RATE AND PEOPLE GO TO. TO BIGGER BOX STORES BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO HAVE LOWER PRICES BECAUSE THERE'S MORE OF THEM. VERSUS IF YOU GO TO A SMALL LITTLE BOUTIQUE YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE PAYING MORE BECAUSE IT HAS MORE VALUE BECAUSE THERE ARE FEWER OF THEM. WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT WITH HOUSING WITH THE MORE WE HAVE THE PRICES WILL COME DOWN. ON PEOPLE COULD STILL HAVE THE BIG MASS OF A SINGLE FAMILY HOMES NO ONE SAYING THAT YOU CAN'T. BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE MOE SUPPLY. WE HAVE OUR MORE YOUTH ON THE STREET BECAUSE FAMILIES ARE MORE UNSTABLE THE MORE UNSTABLE FAMILIES ARE THE MORE YOU THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ON. ON THE STREET SO FROM A MENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. WE HAVE TO START ADDRESSING AT THIS FROM THE FAMILY LEVEL. IN OUR SCHOOLS. AND THEN ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE SYSTEM. IT IS- IT IS. IT IS IT IS SOMEONE WHO COMES FROM A FAITH TRADITION IT FEELS LIKE A SIN EVERY TIME I DRIVE DOWN THIS THREE. AND SEE SOME PEOPLE. ON THE STREETS A CLEARLY MENTALLY ILL CHILDREN ARE SENIORS- WE ARE CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE STRONG. SO WE HAVE WE HAVE WE HAVE OF. A LARGER BIG BOX OF PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE TO SOLVE. THE GOOD NEWS IS I THINK WE HAVE EVERYBODY IN THE ROOM WHO CAN ACTUALLY ONE WANT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION I LOOK FORWARD TO US COMING UP WITH REAL SOLUTIONS. NOT CONTINUE TO JUST PUT BANDAIDS-AND PULL PEOPLE FROM THE RIVER. THAT WILL EXHAUST ALL OF US- AND EVERYBODY COMING OUT OF THE RIVER IT DOESN'T COME OUT THE WAY THEY FELL IN. WE HAVE TO GO UPSTREAM WE HAVE TO BECAUSE IT. ADDRESS THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES. THAT THAT EXIST IN OUR SOCIETY IN ORDER TO REALLY MAKE GAINS ON THIS. AND UNTIL WE MAKE GAMES ON THIS. CALIFORNIA IT WILL NEVER GET IT WHAT THE NONE OF US WILL EVER. BE ABLE TO BEAT ARE FULL AND SELVES AND IF WE CAN'T BE OUR FULL SELVES THAN OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR SOCIETY CAN NEVER BE OUR FULL SELVES. SO I AM A- I AM. THANKFUL FOR THIS HEARING TODAY. I AM.

THIS INCLUDES SENIORS AND PEOPLE WITH UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN HOUSED IN LARGE NUMBERS TO THIS EFFORT AND THAT'S WHERE I WILL FOCUS MY REMARKS. EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC THE GOVERNOR ESTABLISHED A ROADMAP TO RECOVERY THAT NOT ONLY ADDRESS THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT OF THE VIRUS AND CALIFORNIANS BUT ALSO THE HISTORIC DESTRUCTION IN THE ECONOMY THAT HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON LOW WAGE WORKERS IN AND THERE'S EXPERIENCING POVERTY.

MISTER DIRECTOR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WORDS TO ADD TO YOUR ENTIRE TEAM'S WORK AS THEY HAVE BEEN MAKING THEMSELVES AVAILABLE OVER THESE PAST MANY MANY MONTHS WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE GOING FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM. EACH OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS THE RESPECTIVE SENATORS WE'RE GOING TO ASK THAT EACH OF OUR PANELISTS DEPUTY DIRECTOR CERTAIN DIRECTOR JOHNSON DIRECTOR VELASQUEZ IF YOU COULD PLEASE KEEP YOUR CAMERAS ON AT THIS POINT. AS WE'RE GONNA BE GOING TO QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE GONNA START OUT WITH A MYSTERY CASSIE IN BERGEN GOING TO CHEER CABALLERO THAT'S RIGHT CASTING THE FLOOR'S YOURS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M DELIGHTED TO SEE HERE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THAT THE FEMA PROGRAM IS GOING TO PAY A 100% REIMBURSEMENT. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S RETROACTIVE TO HAVE SOME IDEA OF WHAT THAT NUMBER IS RETROACTIVELY AND WHAT'S THE GAME PLAN WITH THIS. AS SOME HAS DETERMINED. UNCLEAR FRAGMENTED HOMELESS RESPONSE WILL HAVE HAPPENED THEN AND THEN THE OTHER SECOND QUESTION THE ANSWER BOTH OF THEM IS OF THE ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION- I DIDN'T SEE. A ARE AN ELEMENT IN THERE FOR A CONSTRUCTION OF EIGHTY USE I KNOW THAT WE TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIVERSALITY BUT HE WANTS TO BUILD IT FOR HALF A MILLION DOLLARS AND WE KNOW THAT. ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS A GARAGE CONVERSION CAN BE AS LOW AS EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A REGULAR STANDALONE HUNDRED SIXTY SO. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE GAME PLAN IS PARTICULARLY WHEN WE'RE GOING TO BUY PROPERTIES IN REHAB THEM IF THAT'S IF TO ADDITIONAL EIGHTY USES. INCLUDED THAT MR CARE. THANK YOU SO MUCH BY CASKEY AT LET'S HERE WHY DON'T WE TO. A DEPUTIES. AT TO BE ABLE TO START OUT IN IN MADAM DEPUTY SECRETARY IF YOU WANT TO PASS ON THAT ANY SPECIFICS TO EITHER DIRECTORS DEPUTY SECRETARY ON CENTER BY CATHY'S COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS. YEAH ABSOLUTELY I ADD WILL SORT OF THE INTERNET QUESTION I THINK YOU WERE ASKING AROUND. AND SOME OF THAT DESTROYED SYSTEM BEING IT BEING DISCUSSED IN THE AUDIT- WE DEFINITELY BELIEVE WE HAVE MORE WORK TO BE. DOING IN THIS AREA- BUT WE DO FEEL LIKE SOME OF THE GUYS WE PUT OUT THIS YEAR PARTICULARLY THAT. THE STATEWIDE- STRATEGIC SPENDING GUIDE FOR STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING WAS INTENDED TO HELP LOCAL COMMUNITIES THINK ABOUT HOW TO BREAK THOSE RESOURCES TOGETHER AT THE GROUND LEVEL. I THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT WAYS TO USE THAT FUNDING SO WE'VE BEEN DOING SOME WORK LIKE THAT. ON THE ACTUAL PLAN I MENTIONED ALSO HAS A EXPLICIT WORKING GROUP THAT WILL BE WORKING ON HOW TO MAXIMIZE AND COURTNEY STATE RESOURCES THAT WILL BE GETTING OUT. AS SOON AS THAT THAT ACTUALLY MANAGED APPROVED IDEALLY NEXT MONTH- SO WE DON'T KNOW THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE THERE BUT WE REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT WERE REMOVING AS AS- DIRECTOR DIES BECAUSE THAT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- IN REGARDS TO THE FEMALE QUESTION PARTICULAR. I WILL- SAY THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING A LOT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THAT AREA BUT I THINK IT MIGHT BE BEST FOR DIRECTOR JOHNSON TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ON THAT- IN SOME OF THE WORK THEY'VE BEEN DOING IN THAT SPACE AND THEN- IF IT'S OKAY FOR EIGHTY A QUESTION RIGHT. HAND THAT OVER TO JOHN DIRECTOR OF. AFTER. SURE RELATED TO THIS. A QUESTION AG JUST. THE LADY AT THIS INCREASE IN THE HUNDRED. BECAUSE SHARE OP. WOULD AGAIN WILL LEVERAGE. A NUMBER OF RESEARCH. TO SECURE. IN A- IS NECESSARILY A NUMBER. AT THAT WE CAN GET YOU INTO. ABS OF WHAT WILL BE DRAWN DE. AS THAT SO. BUT A CERTAIN X. AND HE- OUR- TO FOR. AT THE SERVICE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME GOING TO BE EACH BASED ON L. COSTS- IN AND HOW THAT WORKS WHOSE FORWARD. I WE ARE. US IN. AMOUNT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THIS FRONT AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IN IN ALSO JUST REALLY WONDER PRE SHAPE THE PARTNERS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS TO HAVE ALSO BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE IN HELPING. LOCAL COMMUNITIES NAVIGATE AT THEIR ABILITY TO. COMPLETE THE PROJECT WORKSHEETS AND DO THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMPONENTS TO ALLOW FOR THAT AT RESOURCE. TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO THEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH LIKE TO GO BACK TO CENTER MY CAST CINEMA CASKEY- QUESTIONS- OR ANY FOLLOW UP ON- THE DIRECTOR OR THE DEPUTY SECRETARY. HI I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE TWO CHAIRS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE CENTER HERE IN THIS AREA BUT I'M SURE THEY WILL BE. EAGER TO KNOW WHAT THAT EXPECTATION OF THE NUMBER IS AND HOW THE WORK PLAN IS IF IT IS. IF IT'S GOING TO BE DIRECTED AT. CORRECTIONS THAT WE KNOW OR- IMPROVEMENTS IN THE DELIVERY OF SERVICES WHETHER IT'S HOME KEY ROOM KEY SOCIAL SERVICES. EIGHTY USE WHATEVER WHATEVER THAT THERE THERE IS A NUMBER OUT THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS SENATOR WE'LL DO IS WE'LL ASK FOR THE DIRECTOR TO BE TO RESPOND TO THAT- AFTER I CHAIRWOMAN CABALLERO SPEAKS- CHAIRWOMAN THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR- LET ME SEE IF I CAN DO IT MY GOOD COLLEAGUE- FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY DID. IT WHICH IS TO KIND OF GET IT ALL OUT AND SEE WHO IT IS THAT CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION- YEAH. THAT WOULDN'T THE FIRST QUESTION I HAVE IS WHAT WHAT EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE- THROUGH THE- EITHER THE- PROJECT ROOM CARE HOME KEY. TO MAKE SURE THAT SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES CAN ACCESS THE RESOURCES. ON THOSE COMMUNITIES GENERALLY SPEAKING ARE LESS NIMBLE. AND HAVE LESS STAFF. THAT DEALS SPECIFICALLY WITH- THE HOMELESS ISSUES. AND SO AND I'M CONCERNED BECAUSE I TOOK A LOOK AT THE LIST OF. OF THE GRANT AND- A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE GRANTS WENT TO THE BIG WELL ACTUALLY. AT LARGE A LARGE PERCENT. PERCENTAGE WENT TO THE BIG CITIES. AND A HUGE PERCENTAGE- I HAD A NUMBER BUT CAN'T FIND IT WENT TO LOS ANGELES WE KNOW THAT ALI HAD. A TERRIBLE. ISSUE BUT WE ALL DO AND SO THE QUESTION BECOMES. HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT RURAL CALIFORNIA KING CAN ACCESS THESE FUNDS AS WELL- WHY THE HIGH VCANCY RATE- I IT SOMEWHERE I READ THAT 65% OF THE UNITS ARE OCCUPIED SEEMS TO ME. THAT MOTEL ROOMS ARE MOVABLE HE CAN MOVE IN AND YES YOU'D PROBABLY WANT TO. READ TO THEM A LITTLE BIT- BUT BUT WHY DO IT NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC WHY NOT. GET JUST GET PEOPLE IN A BAD. IN THEN I WANT THIS IS NOT THE SUBJECT OF A OF. THE HEARING TODAY BUT IT IS PROBABLY JUST AS IMPORTANT WHICH IS THAT WE'VE BEEN FUNNELING A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE RESOURCES THAT THE STATE GRANTS THROUGH OUR BUDGET. TO THE COMMUNITIES OF CARE CECILIA SIS AND ON AND- THERE THERE ARE THIS YEAR SHE WAS SET UP. BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND IN MY MIND LEAVE SOME REAL ISSUES. UNRESOLVED BECAUSE IT'S NOT A PUBLIC BODY NECESSARILY THEY DON'T HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE BROWN ACT OR ANY OF THOSE KINDS OF REQUIREMENTS. AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY REQUIRED THAT IF YOU WANT TO GET A GRANT YOU CAN'T SERVE ON THE BOARD TO FOR EXAMPLE YOU CAN SERVE ON THE BOARD AND SAY HEY WE ARE AGENCY NEEDS MONEY AND- IT CAN BE GRANTED AND THAT. OBVIOUSLY IS A SITUATION THAT CREATES. CHALLENGES AND THEN WE DON'T REQUIRE THEM TO REPORT INFORMATION TO US IN A WAY THAT GIVES THE SENATE THE ABILITY TO SEE WHETHER THEY'RE- ACTUALLY TAKING PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS WHETHER THEY'RE SATISFYING- AND WITH THAT REQUIREMENTS SAID THAT OF THE GRANT IS AND IT SO IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE'S A WHOLE LOT OF. OF INFORMATION THAT WE SHOULD REQUIRE AS PART OF THIS GRANT SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AND DETERMINE WHETHER SOME COMMUNITIES ARE DOING A BETER JOB IN THE COMMUNITY SO. THAT THAT- I'M I'M CONCERNED THAT WE AS WE DEVELOP OUR PACKAGE THAT IT MAKES SENSE THAT WERE USING OUR MONEY WISELY AND THAT WERE ACTUALLY GETTING PEOPLE OFF THE STREET. MORE IMPORTANTLY GETTING THEM OFF THE STREET PERMANENTLYTHANK YOU VERY MUCH MR THANK YOU SO MUCH- MADAM CHAIR THERE ARE THREE ISSUES IF WE COULD ADDRESS THAT- SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES ACCESS TO FUNDS. TO ON THAT VACANCY RATES THREE ON TRACKING METRICS IN REGARDS TO THE. CONTINUED CARE SCRIPTED MANAGER. THANK YOU SO MUCH IF WE CAN START WITH ACCESS FOR SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES- WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE BECAUSE AFTER. POLICE MISTER I CAN I CAN. I CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION- VERY HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION SO LET ME JUST- SENATE HOW GYRO I THINK- PLEASE KNOW THAT AB EIGHT AT REGIONAL IN A IN IN MANY OTHER- FORMS LIST WAS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS WE WERE DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING PUMPKIN I'M I'M BUT- NOT TOUCH. KEY BECAUSE- WE DESIGNED A PRIORITY UPTICK. TO CREATE A I CAN GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY THROUGHOUT STICK CREATING EIGHT GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS AND SETTING ASIDE A PROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF FUNDS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. AND THOSE AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS BASED ON AFFORDABILITY FACTORS AND RATES AT THAT TIME OF COMING IN A COMMON INFECTION AND ALL EIGHT REGIONS WERE. FULLY SUBSCRIBED I MEAN WE RECEIVED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INTEREST FROM ALL THE REASONS BUT JUST TO PUT IN CONTEXT- D. MENTIONED YOU KNOW IT. AS A WHEN YOU AT THE KEY A. B. BALA ALL IT'S GOING TO HOMELESS BASED ON THE TWENTY TIME COUNT IS THE I. THE WAY THEY GENERALLY- THE COUNTRY IN THE STATE MAY. AT HOME IS IN THE- YOU KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT A WITH CLOSED PER OF THE- POPULATION OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE- HONKY. THE NEW ON THE FOR THAT WAS ROUGHLY 2% WHEN YOU LOOK AT SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY WHICH- ROUGHLY A POPULATION OF THESE AT. THE END IN THESE POPULATION HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS ROUGHLY SIX PERCENT. 80% D. THE AMOUNT OF DOLLARS AND SUPPORT AT HOME KEY- I GAVE TO THE TO THE BALLOT SO IT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE- NOTHING IS PERFECT IN THE DISTRIBUTION BUT WE INTENTIONALLY. WE REALLY INTENTIONALLY ENSURE THAT REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION EQUITY IN THAT REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION WAS- WAS TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AND WE WORK WITH WITH EVERY COMMUNITY WE UNDERSTAND THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES HAD LESS CAPACITY. IT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED EVEN THOUGH. WE WERE DEALING WITH SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WAS TREMENDOUS WITH EACH JURISDICTION. EACH AND EVERYONE OF THE NINETY FOUR PROJECTS THAT RECEIVED AWARDS ACT END OBVIOUSLY LOOK FORWARD AS AS POTENTIALLY THIS PROJECT CAN CONTINUE THIS YEAR. WITH MORE TIME NOW THAT WE WILL AT POTENTIALLY HAVING. OUR HANDS NOT JUST FIVE MONTHS. TO DO. AT AT STAKE IS FOCUSED ON THE EAST OF REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION AND A IN GENERAL THE THAT'S WHERE IMPORTANT. FOR US AND I THE VACANCY RATE IS SOMETHING WITH ROOM TO- WILL HAVE- DIRECTOR JOHNSON. THANK YOU. GLAD TO SO A COUPLE THINGS TO THAT ARE RATE AT THE HOTEL SO THAT HOTEL AND MOTEL COUNT YOUR EVERY SIX THIS NOT NEXT. MEAN THAT WERE FOR EACH OF ROOM RIGHT SOME OF THE AGREE FROM INTENTIONAL SAYING WE LIKE EIGHT OF COURSE I ALSO WANT TO SUPPORT THAT THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES REALLY HELP FACILITATE THE IDENTIFICATION OF WILLING HOTEL AND MOTEL OWNERS TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT- IN IDENTIFYING IN EACH SCREEN THAT WE COULD THEN SHARED WITH THE- LOCAL COUNTY ADMINISTRATORS AND IN TERMS OF WHO. THAT WAS RUNNING THE PROGRAMS BACK AGAIN SO THAT'S KIND OF THE MAXIMUM CAPACITY OF ROOM SECURED AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS AND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING- AND THEN- OCCUPANCY- IS WHAT ARE BEING UTILIZED SO OF COURSE AS THE TRANSMISSION OF THE VIRUS- OVER THE COURSE OF THESE LAST AT AT YEAR. TWELVE MONTHS YEAR I'M HAS CHANGED CERTAINLY THAT'S BEEN DIFFERENT ACROSS COMMUNITIES IN TERMS OF HOW MANY ARE ACCESSING BUT I WOULD JUST SAY THAT WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT DIRECT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO ENSURE THAT THIS TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY. TO SUPPORT ME AGAIN AS AS WE HAVE SAID THIS REALLY GOOD IS IT REALLY IS A BY STATING THAT MEASURE WAS ABLE THAT. PARTICIPATE THE CENTRAL VALLEY AT TASK FORCE THAT WAS DEPLOYED BY THE GOVERNOR A LAST YEAR'S WELL AND WE'RE HEARING DIRECTLY FROM THE HOSPITAL DIRECTORS AND OTHERS ABOUT JESS- THAT THAT THE DIFFERENCES MADE IN TERMS OF I INDIVIDUALS THEY KNOW WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE SHOWN UP I IN THE E. ARE. AND HAVE THIS AFTER HAS SUPPORTED THEM SO AGAIN WE REALLY ENCOURAGE ASKING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EFFORTS TO HAVE THESE AT ROOMS UTILIZED ATWITHIN THE EXISTING PARAMETERS TO SUPPORT I INDIVIDUALS I ALSO JUST A LAST- FOR IN TERMS OF RURAL COMMUNITIES FOR PROJECT ROOM HE AGAIN IT WAS THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN SUPPORT BUT ALSO THAT. DEPLOYMENT OF TREATMENTS THAT WAS. OUT TIONS FOR I CAN. THAT WAS MORE SO. IN SOME CAN. AS SOME OF THE COMMUNITY SO. I AND THEN FINALLY JUST WANT TO. AS CENTER BY POUNCEY IN THE AGAIN IT IS THE- SO WILL BE- APPLYING FOR IT JUST. THE SB MARIA. SO IT'S THE IT'S THE LOCALS BE DRYING DOWN THE STATE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAME DIRECT OF WHAT WE'D LIKE TO BE DO TO GET THE FINAL WORD TO. COPY CENTER I KNOW YOU WANT TO HAVE A FOLLOW UP. I THINK THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR I GUESS THAT. WERE WHAT'S BECOME. TO ME. THROUGH THE ANSWER IS THAT THESE. ARE YOU KNOW IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WERE PURCHASING THROUGH ONE OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE PURCHASING HOTELS. AND USING THEM AS- A CONVERSION TO PERMANENT HOUSING. OR OR USING THEM AS AT. AN INTERIM HOUSING AND TELL. INDIVIDUALS COULD BE PLACED IN PERMANENT HOUSING. NOW IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS RUNNING ROOMS. AND AND SO IT'S NOT A PERMANENT SOLUTION OR IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT GIVES US NEW. HOUSING UNITS. AND THAT'S- THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND. SO IF I AM RIGHT MY CONCERN IS THAT WE REALLY. WE'VE WE'VE SOLVED THE TEMPORARY PROBLEM. WHICH IS A HEALTH CARE ISSUE. RELATED TO KOBE BUT WE HAVEN'T PERMANENTLY. SET UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO USE THOSE. HOUSING UNITS AS PEOPLE MOVE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING AND THAT HAS ME GREATLY CONCERNED. BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY WE'RE RENTING ROOMS AND THAT'S EXPENSIVE- IT IS THE HUMANE AND JUSTTHING TO DO AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT IN TIME BUT- BUT THAT MEANS WEEK WE'VE REALLY GOT TO. UP OUR GAME AND IT REALLY GETS BACK TO THE ISSUES THAT MY- MY GOOD FRIEND CENTER RIGHT BECAUSE HE BROUGHT UP WHICH IS THAT. YOU KNOW WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING FOR THAT THE CHEAPEST ALTERNATIVE. TO GET US HOUSING UNITS IMMEDIATELY. AND WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT THE BUDGET AND THAT WAY AS WELL. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS CENTER COVER ON AND TURN IT BACK OVER TO DIRECTOR VELASQUEZ BECAUSE I THINK THAT. IT DEPENDING ON THE JURISDICTION WHAT WE'VE BEEN SEEN FROM A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS AND PLEASE PUSH BACK ON THE MISTER DIRECTOR. IS THAT THERE'S A TWO STEP PROCESS NUMBER ONE- IT'LL GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE THAT WE SEEN IN CINEMA COUNTY OR MENDOCINO COUNTY. COUNTIES WILL AT PLACE INDIVIDUALS. OFF THE STREETS. INTO THE ROOMS. AT THEN THERE'LL BE A REFURBISHMENT ADVANCED. I TO BE ABLE TO PUT IN FOR EXAMPLE KITCHENETTES SO THAT THEY CAN BECOME. MORE PERMANENT PLACE. TO LIVE BUT THERE'S REALLY A TWO STEP PROCESS OF GETTING FOLKS OFF THE STREETS. IN IN GETTING THEM PERMANENTLY HOW'S THE MISTER DIRECTOR I DON'T WANNA. PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH AND CENTER CABALLERO AYE BRINGS UP SOME VALID CONCERNS SO MISTER CHARACTER IF YOU COULD PLEASE COMMENT ON THAT. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY- THIS. OP I'M GONNA USE- NUMBERS A LITTLE BIT JUST TO- REALLY PUT A FINE POINT ON THIS ISSUE ALL OF. ASSIST BERMAN AND HOUSING- HONKY WAS MAN- I DO I CHOIR THESE. AND HAVE THEM FOR OCCUPANCY WITHIN NINETY DAYS AFTER THE ACQUISITION IN FACT AS OF NOW SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT CLOSED- AT THE VERY LAST AT POINT OF THE MONTH OF DECEMBER THAT THERE IS STILL YOU KNOW BECOME WE ARE STILL HAS NOT AT THE NINETY DAY. AB PLAN HAS NOT EXPIRED YET NOW I'M WITH THE AFTER THISOCCUPANCY IT HAPPENS THEY ARE THERE'S A SMALL PORTION OF THE. SIX THOUSAND AGAIN THIS IS SIX THOUSAND. THE NEW DOORS HOUSING THAT WILL BE AVE- IT ONLY A SMALL PORTION DOES A THOUSAND OF THEM. WILL BE FOR INJURING HOUSING PURPOSES AND THE VAST MAJORITY WILL BE- THURMAN IN HOUSING SO THESE UNITS WILL BE PERMANENTLY FOR THESE POPULATION FOR UP TO FIFTY FIVE YEARS IN THE IN THE IN THE FUTURE HORIZON SO. WE ARE AT CENTER TOMA EUROPE CREATING VAST MAJORITY OF THESE FOR PERMANENT HOUSING IN THESE UNDER THE MODEL PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WE HAVE AN ADDRESS THE ISSUE THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE SERVICES ON SITE THAT WILL THESE PROPERTIES HI EIGHT A WAY TO- ASSISTING ABILITY IN THE LONG TERM- THROUGH ALL OPERATING- A CAPITOL IN CONCERT WE- IT IS IT IS IMPORTANT TO. CLARIFY THAT DOES THIS IS A PROJECT AIMED AT PERMANENT HOUSING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR THE FUTURE A THERE WILL BE SOME ENGINE HOUSING AT THE BEGINNING THERE WILL BE SOME ENGINE HOUSING FOR ACTS MORE MAJORITY OF THESE SIX THOUSAND WAS UNITS BUT THE MAJORITY IS PERMITTED WILL BE PERMANENT UNITS FOR THE HOMELESSNESS POPULATION OF PEOPLE A RISK. AT RISK OF HOMES THANK YOU AND AT THIRTY SECONDS MISTER DIRECTOR THEN I'M GONNA GO TO ENSURE EGGMAN THE OTHER COMPONENT THIS IS AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PASTOR THOSE UNITS. FOR SERVICES AS WELL. YOU WANT TO COME ON THAT THIRTY SECONDS PLEASE SIR. YES SHORT ANSWER YES HI DAN ALL RIGHT THAT SAID LET'S THAN FIVE. YOU MISTER AT LET'S GO TO ENSURE WE EGGMAN MADAM THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THEN GOING FROM- THE VERY FINE BUT MIKE POLICY QUESTIONS BACK. BACK TO A MACRO VIEW FOR A MOMENT- BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE ALL STRUCK AS I AS I LOOK AROUND THIS ROOM AND I AND I LOOK AT EVERYBODY. WE ALL. WE ALL GOT DRESSED THIS MORNING WELL LOOK IN THE MIRROR WE ALL THOUGHT YEAH I THINK I'M YOU KNOW. I THINK I'M READY TO. TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD. AND AS I DROVE FROM MY HOUSE AND STOCK AND I PASSED AND AT LEAST ONE MAN I HAD THIS I HAD TO SLOW DOWN HE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD. CLEARLY HOMELESS CLEARLY. HAVING SOME. MAJOR ISSUES GOING ON I HAD TO WAIT FOR. FOR HIM TO MOVE. IN ALL. FORTY YEARS AGO I WOULD'VE STOPPED AND HELPED. BUT NOW BUT NOW YOU UNDERSTAND. IT YOU KNOW. IF I. IF I STOP THERE'S NOT. REALLY PRACTICAL HELP I CAN DELIVER RIGHT NOW. AS I DROVE UP I FIVE I SAW. AT LEAST. AT LEAST THREE. I CAN'T MEANT SEVEN CAMINO FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN CARS AND A COUPLE MOTOR HOMES. ON THE SIDE I FIVE. AND THEN AS I DROVE IN SACRAMENTO I. YOU KNOW I LOOK TO STOP AT A STOP LIGHT AND THERE'S A MAN LYING ON THE STREET. WITHIN TOUCHING DIFFERENT DISTANCE OF ME WHO DIDN'T HAVE A SHIRT ON. THIS HAND DOWN HIS PANTS. ANOTHER MAN SITTING NEXT TO HIM. CLEARLY THAT'S WHERE THEY LIVE RIGHT THERE ON THE SIDE OF THE STREET IN DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO. IN I SIDE OF THE CAPITOL. AND I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE LIKE TO GOT UP IN THIS MORNING TO AND LOOKED IN THE MIRROR AND- THOUGHT IF THEY LOOKED OKAY TO GO OUT IN THE WORLD BUT- THAT WAS THAT'S NOT THE REALITY. THEY AND WHEN I SEE THEM I SEE CALIFORNIANS. WHEN I SEE YES I SEE CALIFORNIANS. RIGHT WE ARE ALL DESERVING OF THEIR THE RICHES OF THIS OF THIS GOLDEN STATE OR AT LEAST A PLACE TO LAY YOUR HEAD THAT IS NOT. ON THE STREET OR ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. SO MY QUESTION GOING BACK TO THAT KIND OF MACRO ISSUE. SO LET'S SAY. WE ALL WOKE UP TOMORROW AND WE WENT OUTSIDE. AND THERE WERE PEOPLE LIVING ON THE STREET. THERE WERE PEOPLE CAMPING ALONG THE WAYS THERE WEREN'T. PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES GOING ON. IN PLAIN SIGHT. MY QUESTION TO ALL OF YOU BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT MILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE USED TO ADDRESS THIS. I GUESS FOR INTERVIEW WHAT THING IF WE WOKE UP TO THAT WORLD WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY LIVING ON THE STREETS IN CALIFORNIA ANYMORE WHAT WOULD HAVE CHANGED WHAT POLICY WHAT WOULD HAVE CHANGED IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN. THREE THINGS WHAT THREE THINGS WOULD HAVE CHANGED IN ORDER FOR THAT TO OCCUR SO MANY GUESS I'M ASK EACH OF YOU FROM WORK YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE GOOD FOR MULTI PEOPLE HERE TODAY. I'M ASK EACH OF YOU TO WHAT ONE THING FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WOULD HAVE CHANGED IN ORDER FOR US TO WAKE UP. TOMORROW MORNING WITHOUT ALL THE PEOPLE ON THE STREET.

ESTABLISHED THAT RIGHT HOW WE ARE ALL CONNECTED TOGETHER I'M SO YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT IT IS IT IS A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH IS EVERYTHING THAT YOU ALL AS OUTLINED IN IN THIS CONVERSATION. BOTH THE AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING BUT ALSO THEN HOW WE ARE CONNECTING INTENTIONALLY- INDIVIDUALS TO THE COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS BUILT OVER TIME SO IT'S MAKING SURE THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL. AND THOSE IN THE NEEDS OF THAT INDIVIDUAL ARE MET IN SUPPORTING THE CONCEPTS THAT WE ALL TOGETHER HAVE BEEN FORWARDED IN THE HOUSE AND FORCE FIRST CONCEPTS SO I WILL. I WILL BECAUSE THEY ARE IN IN IN DEFERRED MY COLLEAGUES THANK YOU SO MUCH LET'S GO TO- MISTER DIRECTOR AND WILL GO TO MADAME DEBBIE. CENTER MISTER DIRECTOR. SURE- THANK YOU I'LL- A COUPLE.

THE SECOND. WHICH IS POLICIES THAT CAN EXPECT I. X. KNEW HOW. FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THE LEGISLATURE SAUDI URGENCY OF THE MOMENT WITH ONE KEY AND WE AB EIGHTY THREE PASS KEY POLICY PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW US TO MOVE QUICKLY THAN THE TRADITIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS ALLOW SO CONTINUING THIS PROGRAM AND ALL THEIR SIMILAR TO THESE WILL ALLOW FOR THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE NEED THE ASSISTANCE AND AGAIN LOOK NO FARTHER THAN EIGHTY EIGHTY THREE TO KNOW WHY THIS PROGRAM HUNKY HUBBY SUCCESS THAT INDEED AND IS JUST TRYING TO REPLICATE THINGS LIKE THAT. THANK YOU MISTER DIRECTOR MAY DE SECRETARY THEY WERE GONNA GO TO CHAIRWOMAN EGGMAN FOR FINAL COMMENT TO APLEY MADAM DEPUTY. YEAH VERY MUCH APPRECIATE RUSSIAN AS WELL AND WITH REITERATE ALL THE DIRECTORS INSTEAD YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA IS PROBABLY A HOUSING FIRST STATE AND WITH THAT MEANS THAT WE NEED TO BRING NEW HOUSING ONLINE AS WELL AS SORT OF. I THINK MY COUNTY RIGHT NEW UNITS BUT ALSO IN MAKING ABOUT HOW TO REPEAT THIS YEAR'S INTO ARE YOU BECAUSE- THEY STARTED USING RENTAL ASSISTANCE USING LANDLORD INCENTIVES THINGS OF THAT NATURE TO. TRY TO ACCESS THE PRIVATE HOUSE MARKET BUT ALSO QUITE TO THE FACT THAT SENATOR MENTION AND YOU MENTION IF YOU HERE AS WE HAVE THE LARGEST UNSHELTERED HOMELESS POPULATION. IT IS WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BALANCE CRISIS RESPONSE WHICH ARE PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS AND SO BEING ABLE TO HOLD WEEK FOR BOTH OF THOSE AND I WOULD POINT TO OUR ACTION PLAN AND YOU'RE IN THE MIDST OF DRAFTING. WITH SORT OF THE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES THAT NEED TO BE BELIEVE AS CALIFORNIA'S RIGHT FOCUSING ON RACIAL EQUITY AND JUSTICE FOCUSING ON THE FACT THAT PEOPLE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES VARIETY COME HOMELESS I HAD A RANGE OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF INTERVENTIONS AND SUPPORTS THEY NEED TO FIND PERMANENT HOUSING. SO THIS IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL IT IS MULTI PRONGED WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT PEOPLE HAVE VERY DIFFERENT REASONS FOR BEING WHERE THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY NEED TO GET OUT OF IT. AND WE NEED TO BE DOING THAT WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING AND EXPERTISE AND PEOPLE BATTLING SIX PERIODS I'M SO IT NEEDS TO BE MORE PROMINENT NEEDS TO BE VERY REALISTIC AND NOT JUST A ONE. UNFORTUNATELY WE ALL WISH THERE WAS- BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS NOT A ONE A ONE SO ONLY SOLUTION FOR A PROBLEM.

SELENA SAID THE BILL BILL BUILD WE MORE HOUSING WE NEED MORE HOUSING AND YES WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO. TO CARE FOR UNSHELTERED BUT- HI I LOOK FOR THIS CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD BECAUSE I DON'T THINK. JUST MORE THE SAME IT IS GETTING US OUT OF THIS. IT WOULD THEE WAS A STORM BEFORE THE STORM IT'S BEEN IT'S BEEN RAINING AND HAILING FOR AWHILE. THANK YOU SO MUCH READING CHAIR WANTED TO QUIT TIME CHECKING ALL SORT NINE FORTY THREE. WHAT WOULD I DO WE HAVE TO DO IS GET TO OUR NEXT PANEL. A LITTLE BEFORE ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT THAT'S THE NEXT PANEL IS GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. SO WE HAVE TO CURRENTLY IN THEIR QUEUE CENTER CORTESE. CENTER DORADO IN THE MAJORITY LEADER HERTZBERG. SO WE'RE GONNA TURN IT OVER TO CENTER CORTESE AT FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS. GOOD MORNING SIR. THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIRMAN- I'M GONNA JUST CONFINE MY QUESTIONS TO SCALE- AND SEGMENTING AND HOW WE'RE GOING ABOUT THAT JUST TO. GET SOME MORE CLARITY ON THAT FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR. THE INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED. A PRIOR TO TODAY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK THUS FAR WITH VERY LIMITED RESOURCES IN IN MY OPINION. IN I THINK WE SHOULD LOSE SIGHT- THAT WHICH IS A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHERE THERE WEREN'T NOT LINE ITEMS ARE APPROPRIATIONS FOR THIS KIND OF WORK- AVAILABLE TO DO THE WORK AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT SECRETARY SUTTON I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH- YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT HAVING A BALANCE- IN AS I HEARD THEM HOW TO BALANCE INVESTMENT ABLE PURPOSE PART OF HOUSING. AND SHELTER TO DO IT ALL WE CAN HELP PEOPLE WITH AN INCREASE IN UNDERPASSES AND SO FORTH AS WE IS DESCRIBED. BY MY COLLEAGUE WAITING FOR PERMITS SPORT HOUSING TO BE BUILT IT WE HAVE TO BUILD IT. WITH THAT IN MIND- I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT WORK HAS BEEN DONE IN TERMS OF. IN TERMS OF EXTRAPOLATING FOR SCALING THE BUDGETARY APPROPRIATIONS THAT WOULD BE NEEDED- TO BUILD THE NECESSARY PERMITS SUPPORT HOUSING FOR THIS POPULATION WHICH FOR TODAY'S SNAPSHOT IS A HUNDRED FIFTY ONE THOUSAND. AND SIMULTANEOUSLY HOW MUCH. OF A OF AN APPROPRIATION WOULD BE NEEDED. HI TO SHELTER THOSE WHO WERE WAITING FOR THAT PURPOSE PART OF HOUSING WHILE THEY'RE WAITING. I KNOW IT'S A LOT MORE MONEY THAN WHAT YOU HAVE ALL YOU HAVE AVAILABLE TO YOU RIGHT NOW WHAT THE LEGISLATURE TO THE GOVERNOR'S- PAST EFFORTS HAVE HAVE PROVIDED FOR. WHATEVER REASONS GOOD REASONS RELATED TO WHAT WORK HAS BEEN DONE TO EXTRAPOLATE THAT IT LET ME JUST SAY FOR CONTACTS IN SENECA COUNTY WAS RECENTLY A COUNTY SUPERVISOR WE PASSED THE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR EXTREMELY LONG HOUSING BOND. WHICH EXTRAPOLATED OUT WITH A THREE TO ONE INVESTMENT MATCH BETWEEN DEVELOPERS MUNICIPALITIES AND SO FORTH- IS ON SCHEDULE TO HOUSE ABOUT FORTY HUNDRED FOLKS IN PURPOSE PORT OF HOUSING. I WILL ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IN THAT COUNTY THERE'S REALLY NO SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FOR SHELTERING- THE EIGHT THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL. IN KANSEN AND CREEKS WAITING FOR THAT PURPOSE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND THAT IS THE CONTEXT FOR THAT QUESTION I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO SCALE AT A STATEWIDE LEVEL. LASTLY LET ME JUST ASK IN IT AND ALL SIT DOWN STRUCTURE WHAT- HAS BEEN DONE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SEGMENTATION. IN THAT SCARY FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE DIFFERENT TOOLS AVAILABLE M. PARTNERS AVAILABLE A WITH REGARD TO. ENDING VETERANS HOMELESSNESS. I THAN THERE IS FOUR X. FOUR OTHER DEMOGRAPHICS FOR EXAMPLE. AM I INTRODUCED A BILL. SB. SEVEN THIRTY NINE. WHICH TALKS ABOUT BASIC INCOME. A FOR FOSTER YOUTH TRANSITION AGE FOSTER YOUTH THE POPULATION. AT REPRESENTS ABOUT 40% OF THE YOUTH HOMELESSNESS NOW. IN ABOUT ONE IN FOUR TRANSITION AGE FOSTER YOUTH ARE HOMELESS TODAY- SO AGAIN CONTEXT I'M JUST ASKING FOR CONTEXT ARE PROVIDING CONTEXT IN TERMS OF MY QUESTION HOW MUCH SHOULD WE LOOK AT ATTACKING SEGMENTS DEMOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS BASED ON VARIOUS TOOLS WE HAVE AVAILABLE THANK YOU THE STRUCTURE THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATORS SO- WHAT WE'RE GOING TO ASK IS THE DEPUTY SECRETARY TO BE ATTORNEY. TAKE THREE QUESTIONS AND WE'RE GONNA DO A LITTLE BIT OF A LIGHTNING ROUND JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHER SENATORS WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK SO IF YOU CAN TALK ABOUT. HOW MUCH IS NEEDED. TO SHELTER THOSE HUNDRED ONE FIFTY ONE THOUSAND. WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN TO BE A TO SCALE THE BUDGET. AND THEN WHAT WITH APPROACH WOULD BE IN REGARDS IS SEGMENTING THE HOMELESS POPULATION WHETHER IT'S- WOMEN AND KIDS- VETERANS THOSE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE X. ADDRESS IF YOU COULD DEAL WITH THOSE THREE SPECIFICS- CENTER CORTESE THANK YOU SO MUCH READING DEPUTY SECTOR THE FLOOR'S YOURS. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- I THINK YOU ARE GOING TO BE VERY INTERESTED AND THE HOME DATA INTEGRATION SYSTEM THAT WE ARE LAUNCHING HERE. IN ABOUT A MONTH AND SO I WILL MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW UP AND MAKE SURE YOU GET A DEMONSTRATION OF THAT I THINK THAT IS OUR BEST CHANCE AT THIS STAGE- NEED TO REALLY UNDERSTAND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ACCESSING HOMELESSNESS SERVICES ACROSS THE STATE. AND SO IT WELL IT WON'T TO GET AT A WHOLE GAS ASSESSMENT REMAINS OF THAT NATURE IT VERY MUCH WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ACCESSING SERVICES HOW MANY FOLKS ARE STAR ARE STILL. UNABLE TO MOVE THROUGH THE SYSTEM AS ME BUT AT MEDIA AND QUICK WAY- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THAT HOMELESSNESS IS NOT STATIC AND SAID THERE ARE WHAT WE CALL INFLOWS. AND AS IT IS FOR THIS IS FROM THE SYSTEM REALLY AND SO REALLY BEING MINDFUL OF HAVING A FULL SYSTEM FROM CHILDREN ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO PERMANENT HOUSING IS REALLY CRITICAL SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE A BETTER DAY. HIS FORM THOSE KINDS OF QUESTIONS HERE IN JUST A MONTH AND SO WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO BE ABLE. TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU ALL AND WITH THAT I ALSO WILL GET SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MEDITATION AT THAT AGE I ASKED SYSTEM WILL ALLOW US TO TRACK. ON VETERANS HOMELESSNESS. MANY USE ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS THAT HAD- HAD REPORTED ITEMIZING VIOLENCE. AND WE WILL BE ABLE TO REALLY SEGMENT OUT WHAT IS WORKING FOR. AND BE ABLE TO BETTER TARGET OUR POLICY THAN PHYSICAL DECISIONS BASED ON THAT SO WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING THE SYSTEM FOR ALMOST EIGHTEEN MONTHS IT LAUNCHES NEXT MONTH IN YOUR INCREDIBLY EXCITED BY. THE OPPORTUNITY THAT IT PRESENTS- YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF OTHER SEGMENTATIONS I WOULDN'T KNOW WE DO HAVE YOU SET ASIDE FINDING WHEN HE BEHALF WE HAVE SEEN THAT CAN BE VERY USEFUL. IN GETTING THAT POPULATION THE ATTENTION IT NEEDS AND THEN OUR RESIDENTS RESPONSE SYSTEM- AND SO I THINK WE'LL BE ABLE THAT HIGHLIGHTS AND MORE OF THAT. IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS. THE QUESTION. FINDING PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THROUGH A HOME KEY ADDITIONAL TEMPORARY IN HIS ROOM KEY OR- OTHER. SOURCES THIS. DATA SYSTEM IS GONNA TELL US HOW MUCH WOULD BE NEEDED- IN WHAT THE APPROACH SHOULD BE IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. I THINK IT WILL HELP INFORM ACTION I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO RESEARCH ACCESS PRINTER ARE QUITE EXTENSIVE KIANA AND RESPONSIBLE WAY BUT I THINK THAT YEAH I ASK WILL START IT'S ON A PATH TO HAVE. A VERY GOOD ANSWERS TO BE GETTING ACCESS YES. IF IT'S IN THE INTEREST OF EACH OF THE COMMITTEE CHAIRS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I THINK ANY WOULD BE HELPFUL IS- IN THE NEXT SIXTY TO NINETY DAYS THAT WE CAN HOST. A BRIEFING ON THAT SO THAT MEMBERS CAN HAVE.

ON THOSE PROGRAMS BEFORE WE GET INTO IT THOUGH WITH ACTIVATED TURN THE FLOOR OVE. TO THE CHAIRWOMAN OF THE SENATE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE THAT SENATOR HER TITLE. I TO BE ABLE TO GIVE SOME OPENING REMARKS SHE HAD ANOTHER MEETING AT THE START WHICH WE KNEW ABOUT CENTER HER TITLE. THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. YOUR LAST YEAR I LEARNED I CAN EASILY BLAME OTHERS FOR THE PROBLEMS WE ARE FACING HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OR I CAN BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. WE KNOW THAT MODELS HERE. AND REALLY ACROSS THE NATION HAVE NOT BEEN WORKING AND I REALLY DON'T WANT TO PUT BLAME ON ANYONE- BUT I GUESS I WILL ASK EVERYONE HOW CAN WE BETTER HOW CAN WE BE BETTER LISTENERS AND HOW CAN WE BETTER COORDINATE TO FIND SOLUTIONS. AND THE REALITY IS THAT THROWING MONEY AT A PROBLEM WITHOUT REALLY FULLY UNDERSTANDING. THE ISSUE AT THAT WE HAVE AT HAND IS. IS JUST THROWING MONEY AT SOMETHING THAT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE ANYTHING AND- EVERYTHING IS REALLY INTERCONNECTED RIGHT FOR TALKING ABOUT HOMELESSNESS AND HOW TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS AND THE HOUSING ISSUE THAT WE HAVE HERE. BUT I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THIS HEARING IS A GREAT START ON HOW DO WE GET TO SOLVE ANY PROBLEMS FOR CALIFORNIANS BUT- HILL I WAS READING AN ARTICLE NOT TOO LONG AGO AND- IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT HOW TO APPROACH. ALL THE POPUP ALL THE DIFFERENT PROBLEMS UP WITH THE WERE HAVING HERE TODAY. IN CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND AND THAT'S- CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION- WE NEED TO. BE ADAPTING RATHER THAN TRYING TO PREVENT WHAT IS ALREADY HERE. AND I WAS READING THROUGH THE ARTICLE THE GREAT CLIMATE MIGRATION- THAT WAS- POSTED ON THE NEW YORK TIMES. AND IT MENTIONS THE STORY OF A- OF A SMALL FARMER OUT OF GUATEMALA. AND HOW THE DROUGHT BASICALLY FORCED HIM AND HIS FAMILY OUT OF OUT OF THIS COUNTRY- THEY WERE FACING STARVATION THEY WERE- DIDN'T HAVE ANYWHERE TO. AT YOU KNOW TO SLEEP- AND IT MADE ME THINK A LOT ABOUT WHAT WE'RE FACING HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE FIRES AND PEOPLE BEING DISPLACED IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT JUST EVEN RECENTLY MY SISTER WHO I HAVE ACTUALLY ENTIRE FAMILY THAT LIVES IN TEXAS AND HOW THEY'VE BEEN DISPLACED BECAUSE OF THE- EXTREME. WEATHER THAT THE FEAST THERE WITHOUT ELECTRICITY WITHOUT WATER. AND THE REALITY IS THAT IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION IN THE CAR ACROSS THE WORLD BUT HOW DO WE ADAPT TO BEASTIES. TO THIS NEW THIS IS NEW CIRCUMSTANCES. AND I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S- WHAT'S WHAT AMALA- IT'S FAR AWAY THEY'RE MIGRATING NORTH. THE REALITY IS THAT IT'S HAPPENING HERE IN CALIFORNIA- WHERE I THINK PEOPLE ARE MIGRATING BECAUSE OF THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT. CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALREADY CREATING AND I THINK- ABOUT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE PRINT HOW DO WE PREVENT PEOPLE FROM STARVATION HOW DO WE- IT'S A TOPIC WE HAVE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT IT AS A WHOLE AND NOT JUST IN IN AND SILOS. AND I REALLY APPRECIATE- EVERYONE IN THE WORK THAT THEY DO BUT I REALLY BELIEVE THAT. ARE THE RIGHT ONE OF THE- RECOMMENDATIONS COMING OUT OF THE ALLEY- IN THE STATE AUDITOR. WAS TO BE I AM A BIT MORE CLEAR LESS FRAGMENTED AND TO A LONG TERM STRATEGY FOR ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND I THINK THAT- THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON WITH THAT AND I THINK THAT TODAY I HOPE THAT WE ALL THINK ABOUT IT- AND YOU KNOW THAT WE THINK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THAT SENSE THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH READING CHAIR VERY GRATEFUL AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP IN THIS CRITICAL. BUT HEARING TODAY LADIES AND GENTLEMEN COMMITTEE WE'RE NOT GONNA BE MOVING ON TO OUR NEXT PANEL WHICH IS GOING TO BE FOCUSING ON THE LOCAL VIEW SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES WITH PARTS OF ROOM KEY AND HOME KEY THAT WE'RE GOING TO START THE PANEL OFF WITH JIM PREVENTIVA BUT SHE IS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR IN THE GREAT COUNTY OF YOLO BUT WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT SUPERVISOR PREVENTIVA IS WITH US TONIGHT SUPER THE PRESENT PREVENT THAT YOU HAVE THREE TO FIVE MINUTES I'LL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND PROMPT. IS A SUPERVISOR THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR. MISTER PRESIDENT OF THE- EGO. GOT YOU OFF ME BUT HE DIDN'T SURPRISE US VERY GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME THANK YOU. IT'S VERY GOOD TO BE HERE. AND I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THE PROJECT- A ROOM KEY AND PROJECT HOME HE HAD BEEN A GODSEND FOR YOLO COUNTY. WE DON'T HAVE. OBVIOUSLY IS A SMALL COUNTY AT. LITTLE OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. THE RESOURCES SET TO HOUSE THAT MANY PEOPLE. IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND IT WAS. AN. EMERGENCY CONTINUES TO BE AN EMERGENCY. WE WERE A TO. US HUNDRED AND SEVEN HOMELESS PEOPLE IN HOTELS MOTELS THAT WERE RENTED. IN THE CITY OF DAVIS THE CITY OF WOODLAND AND THE CITY OF WEST SACRAMENTO. BUT WE WERE ABLE TO DO THIS QUICKLY AND- IN DOING THIS WE WERE ABLE TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE IT WAS OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVE DURING THE PANDEMIC TO PREVENT OUTBREAKS INVITE. USE THEM FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED TO HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO NEED TO BE ISOLATED WE ALSO. WERE PROTECTING THE MEDICALLY VULNERABLE SO PEOPLE OVER AGE SIXTY FIVE WHETHER UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS. WHO WERE UN HOUSED WELL WE'RE PLACED IN THE HOTELS WE BELIEVE THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PLACE EVERYBODY IN THAT CATEGORY THAT- THAT WANTED TO BE PLACED. BUT THAT ALSO RELIEVED PRESSURE AT THE SHELTERS BECAUSE THERE WAS LESS LESS DEMAND ON THE SHELTERS. FOR DISTANCING AND WE WAS AND ALSO IN THOSE WHO REMAIN HOMELESS AND HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS WE WERE ALSO ABLE TO INTRODUCE HEALTH MEASURE THERE AND KEEP THEM SAFE AND WE DID. AVOID AN OUTBREAK. SO IT WAS SIX HUNDRED HOMELESS PEOPLE. SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND. NIGHTS SHOW. AND WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER VERY SIX PROGRAM I WAS NOT SURE WHEN WE WENT INTO THIS- HOW THINGS WOULD GO DOWN BOTH THE MOTELS WE USED IN DAVIS I REPRESENT DAVIS. WERE IN MY DISTRICT AND I WAS PREDICTING- A LOT OF COMPLAINTS FROM NEIGHBORHOODS AND PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN THE AREA. I RECEIVED NONE. RIGHT OFTEN RECEIVE COMPLAINTS IN OTHER AREAS WHERE WE'RE AT HOMELESS OR NOT HOUSE IN THIS SITUATION ONE OF THE REASONS IS ONE OF THE COMPLAINTS THE VERY SIMPLE THINGS ALL DAY THEY GO TO THE BATHROOM- IN PUBLIC WORDS THEY GO AROUND ASKING FOR MONEY BECAUSE THEY NEED FOOD. WELL GUESS WHAT WE HAD IN THE MOTELS WE HAD A PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER CITIES WITH THE FOOD BANK WITH ALL THE SOCIAL SERVICES AND WRAP AROUND SERVICES SO THEY HAD A PLACE TO USE THE RESTROOM THEY HAD FOOD THEY HAVE HOT MEALS NOT ALWAYS BUT MOST OF THE TIME WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE HOT MEALS FROM LOCAL RESTAURANTS. ARE WE READING ABLE TO USE THE FOOD BANK TO DELIVER FOOD WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE HEALTH SERVICES THROUGH COMMUNITY CARE FUNDED BY DIGNITY HEALTH AND CENTER. AND THIS WAS ALL DONE VERY VERY RAPIDLY I THINK BECAUSE OF OUR PRIOR RELATIONSHIPS BECAUSE THAT WE HAD DONE THIS WORK ALREADY IN OUR HOUSING FIRST PROGRAM AND WE HAD THE CITIES AND THE COUNTY WORKING TOGETHER THEN THE COUNTY BY THE WAY. IS LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR PEOPLE LIVING IN THE RURAL AREAS OF THE UNINCORPORATED. YOLO COUNTY. ONE APART ONE IN OKAY THANK YOU WE ARE ALSO NOW- ENTERING HOME SHE- THE CITY OF WEST SACRAMENTO HAS PURCHASED A HOTEL CITY OF DAVIS HAS RENTED ON LONG TERM LEASES SOME APARTMENT BUILDINGS TO OFFER AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND WE ARE WORKING ON PERMANENT HOUSING WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO. PLACE EIGHTY FIVE PEOPLE IN PERMANENT HOUSING AND WE HOPE TO INCREASE THOSE NUMBERS DRASTICALLY I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER ONE QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED DURING THE PRIOR PANEL WHAT WOULD WE HAVE TO ELIMINATE A TOURNAMENT OF. THE HOW HOMELESS WORK A PROBLEM WITH OUR IN HOUSE PERSON SAID I WOULD SAY PROPERTY ALREADY IS THE GOAL AND WE ARE DOING A PILOT PROJECTS SOON THAT WILL PROVIDE BASIC INCOME THAT MEANS TAKING PEOPLE OUT. OF POVERTY. WHO HAVE CHILDREN ZERO TO FIVE- AND GIVING THEM ENOUGH MONEY A BASIC INCOME AND SEEING WHAT THAT DIFFERENCE THAT MAKES. OVER A PERIOD OF A YEAR AND I THINK INTEREST PASTA SENATOR HERTZBERG. SUGGESTION OF BOLD MOVES THAT MAY OR MAY NOT WORK I THINK THIS PHONE BILLS THAT CATEGORY ARE COUNTY WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU AND DEVELOPING SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND FOR ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM MEANS A LOT TO US THANK YOU. IT'S SUPERVISORS SO GOOD TO SEE YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND WE'RE GRATEFUL YOU'RE WITH US AND WE APOLOGIZE THAT IT'S TAKEN A LITTLE TIME TO BE A TO GET TO THIS PANEL AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. IN NOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE GOOD MAYOR FROM THE CITY OF EL CENTRO HER NAME IS CHERYL VIEGAS WALKER IN ADDITION TO HER DUTIES AS MAYOR SHE IS ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CITIES.

ON ALL ISSUES OF SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES WITH PROJECT ROOM KEY AND HOME KEY THE FLOOR IS YOURS NOT A MATTER. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND GOOD MORNING CHAIRS AND MEMBERS IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY- ON SUCH AN IMPORTANT TOPIC. I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT THROUGH THE LEADER CALIFORNIA CITIES CITY LEADERS HAVE ABSOLUTELY MADE IT A PRIORITY TO ADDRESS A HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS AS WELL AS HOMELESSNESS. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND CERTAINLY PROJECT ROOM KEY AND HONKY HAVE PROVIDED CITIES WITH ADDITIONAL TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH THOSE TWO TO HORRIFIC ISSUES WE'RE DEFINITELY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE I COULD NOT BE MORE PLEASED WITH THE TESTIMONY. AND QUESTIONS I'VE HEARD SO FAR THIS MORNING SENATOR WIENER IS ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON WE HAVE A PROFOUND HOUSING SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED SENATOR EGGMAN ABSOLUTELY WE HAVE GOT TO ADDRESS THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES. AND IF YOU ASK ME WHAT I NEED RIGHT AWAY I NEED ACCESS TO. HEALTH SERVICES AND SO OF CAL. IN ORDER- CAVALEIRO I AGREE ABSOLUTELY THERE HAVE TO BE METRICS INVOLVED ACCOUNTABILITY AND EQUITY COMING FROM A RURAL COMMUNITY THAT WAS MUSIC TO MY EARS AND SENATOR TITLE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TALKING ABOUT- BETTER COLLABORATION AND STRATEGY. JUST TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT BECAUSE I JUST WANT TO GIVE A BIG THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU TO KNOW THE LIFE CHANGING IMPACTS THAT YOUR LEADERSHIP HAS HAD. IN OUR COMMUNITY- COUNTY WERE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND PEOPLE WE ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY ISOLATED IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE LOCATED. THINK ABOUT HOW I CAN SEE MEXICO FROM MY BACKYARD WE ARE IN THE SOUTH EASTERN CORNER OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE WERE STRUGGLING WITH AN 18% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE ONE IN FOUR OF OUR- RESIDENTS LIVES IN POVERTY. WE ARE 84% THE LATINO COMMUNITY- OUR AVERAGE SALARY IS FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS WE HAVE ONE. COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN OUR COUNTY WE HAVE ONE. SATELLITE CAMPUS OF THE CSU. AND WE HAVE LESS THAN 20% OF OUR RESIDENTS TO HOLD A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND GIVEN THOSE DYNAMICS WHY BEING ABLE TO PARTNER WITH ARE ONLY COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR HOMELESS STUDENTS WITH A TARGET ON FOSTER YOU. HAS JUST BEEN A GAME CHANGER AND AGAIN. THANKS TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. WHAT TALK ABOUT HOW THIS WAS FUNDED THE CITY OF ALL CENTRO RECEIVED TWO POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN GRANT FUNDS FROM PROJECT HUNKY FOR CONSTRUCTION. IMPERIAL VALLEY COLLEGE RECEIVED FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND. DOLLARS FROM IMPERIAL COUNTY. FROM I KEEP FINDING. AND THEN THE CITY OF ALL CENTURY IN A- FIVE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN GRANT FUNDING FROM ENTERPRISE WHICH IS GOING TO FIND TWO YEARS OF OPERATION. AND OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH IMPERIAL VALLEY COLLEGE WE LEARNED THAT THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED AND TEN SELF IDENTIFIED HOMELESS STUDENTS. MAKING US FOR THE SITE ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS IS GOING TO BE PROVIDED BY THE IMPERIAL VALLEY COLLEGE FOUNDATION ONE MINUTE NATION IS GOING TO BE. RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING ON SITE AND OFF SITE CASE MANAGEMENT. THE RENT IS GOING TO BE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS PER STUDENT PER MONTH AND STUDENTS WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE TEN HOURS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE. HOURS PER MONTH PROJECT IS GONNA SERVE STUDENTS WITH EXTREMELY LOW INCOME AND PRIORITIZE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. I CENTER REQUIRE ACCESS TO WHAT WE THOUGHT WORKED WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WHAT WORKED WELL THEY DIRECT ALLOCATION OF MONIES TO CITIES THE SEQUEL EXEMPTIONFOR SITE ACQUISITION- THE ABBREVIATED TIME FRAME BECAUSE WE COULDN'T JUST DILLY DALLY AROUND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS. WHAT WAS GOING TO WORK WE HAD TO GET THOSE STUDENTS HOUSE RIGHT AWAY- WHAT ALSO HELPED A LOT WAS THAT THE AVERAGE COST TO PROVIDE THIS HOUSING IS A FRACTION. OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS WHAT IS NOT WORKING AS WELL AS WITH REGARD TO PROJECT ROOM K&lt;c.cyan&gt;. FUNDING BEING- KIND&lt;/c&gt; OF TARGETED TO THE COUNTY AND YET IN OUR COUNTY ONLY 21% OF OUR RESIDENTS LIVE IN THE COUNTY THE REST RESIDE IN CITIES AND ALL OF THOSE HOTELS ARE LOCATED IN THE CITIES AND THEN THERE'S NOT. GOOD COORDINATION WITH WRAPAROUND SERVICES- COMING OUT OF COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SO IF THERE IS ONE THING THAT I WOULD CHANGE- WITH REGARD TO PROJECT BRING KEY IS THAT THERE BE GREATER COLLABORATION AND INCLUDE THE CITY'S BEST PART OF THAT CONVERSATION. AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE THANK YOU FOR YOUR GREAT WORK AND YOUR LEADERSHIP.

GET TO THESE KIDS QUICKLY CUT THEM STABILIZE GET THEM IN THE HOUSE AND GET THEM ON TRACK- THEY'RE GONNA YOU KNOW BE ABLE TO HAVE GREAT LIVES BUT IF WE- DON'T INTERVENE AND DON'T HELP THEM AND DON'T PROVIDING THE SUPPORT THEY NEED- WE COULD BE. ARE HELPING CREATE THE NEXT GENERATION OF CHRONIC LONG TERM HOMELESSNESS THE LAST THING THAT WE NEED- AND SO AS I MENTIONED THE BEGINNING. MOST CALIFORNIA COUNTIES DO NOT HAVE YOU SPECIFIC HOMELESS PROGRAMS. HI WHEN YOU CERTAIN GROUPS YOUTH INTO THE ADULT HOMELESS SYSTEM- THAT JUST DOES NOT GET ON THE SUPPORT. BY THE DATE THAT THEY NEED- IN ADDITION THE STATE UNTIL ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO WAS INVESTING ALMOST NOTHING. AND YOU SPECIFIC HOMELESS NEEDS ARE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE OUT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS BUT IT IS NOT NEARLY WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE- I WILL MENTION THAT- WITH SENATE BILL TWO THIRTY FOUR THIS YEAR WE'RE TRYING TO GET. A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THE STATE. I IN THE HOUSING FOR YOUTH EXITING HOMELESSNESS FOSTER CARE SYSTEM A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM- AND WE REALLY REALLY NEED TO GET ON TOP OF THIS AND HELP THESE KIDS. NOT TO SURVIVE BUT THRIVE AND I KNOW THAT WE CAN DO THAT- SO I WILL NOT HEAR FROM- GOMEZ AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS CONVERSATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR EMIGRATE FROM THE CHAIR FOR HIS PARTNERSHIP IN FOR PLANNING.

I AM A LAUNDROMAT AND I'M ONE YEARS OLD I'M- LIVING IN CINEMA COUNTY I'VE EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS AND BETTER FORMER FOSTER YOUTH. AND I NOW WANT TO ANY. TO RECYCLE. NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF BUT FOR MY COMMUNITY PEERS LOCAL STATEWIDE AND BEYOND. I GREW UP IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM SINCE AGES SIX AND IT'S FROM MATIC EXPERIENCE I NEVER HAD SUPPORT COMING OUT OF THE FOSTER CARE SYTEM WHAT THE PARENTS WOULD ADOPTED ME. WAS TO RECEIVING MONEY FROM MY ADOPTION AND I WAS TOLD I WASN'T ELIGIBLE FOR ANY. EXTENDED FOSTER CARE PROGRAM. WE MUST DO BETTER ACCESS. EXITING BOX. KIDS I. REALIZING THAT THEY THAT THEY NEEDS ESPECIALLY AT THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE THAT I NEVER GOT I AM NOW TWENTY ONE AND I'VE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS MY GOALS WELL I WASN'T ELIGIBLE FOR ANY EXTENDED FOSTER YOUTH PROGRAMS I WAS ABLE TO GET HELP YOU CAN DO SUPPORT NETWORK OF WHICH IS FOR MENTAL HEALTH. ONCE CALL BUT HEY I LOST MY JOB AND I WAS WORRIED THAT I WASN'T ABLE TO GET ANY SUPPORT SAYS AS A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH WE DO NOT HAVE. THE ABILITY TO HAVE PARENTSTO GUIDE US THROUGH THINGS AND- THAT WAS A BIG PART OF THE STRUGGLE THAT I FACED. I ALSO HAVE FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO EXPERIENCESSAME HOMELESSNESS A YOUNG AGE AND STRUGGLE TREMENDOUSLY THIS IS WHY I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT DOING THIS WORK. MY PRIMARY GOAL IN LIFE IS TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM TO SUPPORT YOU WITH PREDOMINANTLY BLACK INDIGENOUS AND PEOPLE OF-COLOR. AND THE LGBTQ PLUS COMMUNITY FOR OVER PRESENTED AND ARE HOMELESS POPULATION BECAUSE WE'VE MISSED OPPORTUNITIES TO SIR AND MEET THEIR NEEDS. AND THE PAST. BLACK INDIGENOUS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE THE FIRST ONES TO BE HERE. THE LAST ONES TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE FIRST ONES TO BE REJECTED. ONE IF THEY DO ANYTHING. AND THAT IS WHY I WAS SO INTERESTED AND COMMITTED INTO JOINING WANT OTHER DAY. AND ALLOW ME TO. THE CINEMA SYSTEM. TO ENSURE THAT SO TAKES. I HAD WHEN I WAS YOUNGER AND THE LACK OF HELP I EXPERIENCED. ONCE I WAS OUT OF THE SYSTEM DON'T HAPPEN TO MY PEERS. AND THE LACK. AND THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT WE- HAVE TO FACE I'M SORRY I'M READING THIS BUT IF I'M GONNA BE HONEST. TO SAY THAT- THE ONE WHO DO YOU HELPS ME A LOT TO REALIZE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO FACE AND- SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. ARE THE RULES REGARDING- LAKE COUNTY SHOPPING AND REGARDING WHEN IT COMES TO FUNDING. AND I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN HELP THOSE SOCIETIES FUNDING THESE PROGRAMS FOR THESE YOUTH ESPECIALLY ONES THAT WERE ADOPTED AT SIXTEEN. OR THAT WERE ADOPTED ONCE THEY WERE IN THE SYSTEM- THE SYSTEM WAS JUST IN A PLACE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO HELP ME. AND A FEELING ME. AND I THINK OUR GREATEST SOLUTION TO ENDING HOMELESSNESS IS STARTING BY PREVENTING IT. IF YOU WANT TO HELP OLDER PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE HOMELESS YOU NEED TO HELP THE YOUNG ADULTS BECAUSE WE ARE THE FUTURE WE ARE THE. NEXT GENERATION. AND I AM THE FUTURE THAT'S THIS A- THANK YOU BUT IT'S ALRIGHT. WITH GO MAYES. WE ARE SO APPRECIATIVE YOU TAKE THE TIME TO BE A TO BE WITH US TO NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO TO BE TO SHARE YOUR STORY.

AS WELL AS- URBAN. CONTI'S AS WELL IN SPEAKING OF THAT WE ARE GRATEFUL THAT HEIDI MARTIN IS WITH US HE IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LOS ANGELES HOMELESS SERVICES AUTHORITY. A JPA. MISS MARTIN HAS VERY SMALL JOB- IT HERE AND- SHE IS THE COORDINATOR OF THE GPA BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE COUNTY HE'S GOING TO BE TALKING TO US ABOUT THE SUCCESSES. THE CHALLENGES IN WHAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO BE A SEA CHANGE AS WE MOVE FORWARD WHEN IT COMES TO PROJECT ROOM KEY AND HOME KEY. ALL RIGHT MISS MARTIN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR LOS ANGELES HOMELESS SERVICES AUTHORITY FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES YOU'LL GET A ONE MINUTE AND THIRTY SECONDS FROM THE MORNING. GOOD MORNING FACE SO MUCH OF REALLY FOR. YOU ALL HAVING HERE- AGAIN MY NAME IS MARCIN I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LOS ANGELES HOMELESS SERVICES AUTHORITY. WE ARE THE LEAD AGENCY FOR THE LOS ANGELES CONTINUUM OF CARE AND WE'RE ALSO JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. AS YOU ALL KNOW WELL HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT ALL MORNING OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS ACROSS ALL OF CALIFORNIA. BEFORE PROBATED THERE WERE A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. AND OVER SIXTY SIX THOUSAND OF THOSE WERE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE. WE ALL KNOW THAT KOBE IS VERY LIKELY TO MAKE THIS CRISIS WORK. I TENS OF THOUSANDS OF HOUSEHOLDS HAVE THEIR LIVES TURNED UPSIDE DOWN BY FINANCIAL. DIFFICULTY ILLNESS OR DEATH. MEANWHILE LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVING RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO THE CRISIS HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE IN LA WHERE WE RELY ON MEASURE H. SALES TAX REVENUE TO THE STATE ARE HOMELESS WITH THEM. WE HAVE A PROJECTED SEVENTY ONE MILLION DOLLAR SHORTFALL I DO TO THE PANDEMIC AND SPENDING BEING DOWN. DESPITE THOSE CHALLENGES THROUGH COLLABORATION WITH OUR GOVERNMENT PARTNERS WE LEVERAGE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL RESOURCES TO RESPOND OKAY NINETEEN. IN LESS THAN SIX MONTHS WE'VE BROUGHT OVER EIGHT THOUSAND OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE NEIGHBORS INSIDE THROUGH PROJECT ROOM HE AND OTHER JOINT EFFORT. BUT WE KNOW THAT OUR WORK DOESN'T STOP THERE AND SO NOW OUR FOCUS IS TO PERMANENTLY HOUSE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SHELTERED COVE IN NINETEEN AND THOUSANDS MORE USING OUR RECOVERY ROADMAP THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED ITH OUR CITY AND OUR COUNTY PARTNERS. WHAT WE ALL AGREE ON IS THAT WE CANNOT GO BACK TO STATUS QUO POST CODE AND WE NEED TO TAKE THE MOMENTUM REBUILT. AND CONTINUED BUILD AN EXPLORATION MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE WE HAVING. OF MANY BROKE OFF BALL. IN L. A. COUNTY ARE CONTINUUM OF CARE HAS BILL IN EFFECT RATE. WHICH OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS A LOT THE HOUSE SIX ONE. NINE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT PEOPLE WHICH IS NEARLY THE SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS DURING THE LAST COUNT WAS ABOUT ABOUT SIXTY SIX THOUSAND. WE'VE DONE THAT BY IMPROVING COURTNEY HERE IN OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT PARTNERS. BUT DESPITE ALL OF THIS LAST YEAR ALONE TWO HUNDRED FIVE PEOPLE EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR HOUSE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY BUT TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE FELL INTO HOMELESSNESS EACH DAY. TO TRULY ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS WE NEED AN EQUALLY POWERFUL HOMELESS PREVENTION MACHINE THAT KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES AND I'M MATH OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUPPLY MACHINE THAT CREATES YOUR NECK ON THE BACK AND- THAT WE HAVE THE STOCK WILL BE IN FLOW AND- HALF OF. THAT WOULD WORK. OKAY BUT STILL. WE ALSO WANTED TO DO THINK THIS FOR THE- IN HEAT. SINCE RISK HE FUNDING AT THE BEGINNING OF TWENTY. AND L. A. SERVED OVER SEVEN FIVE PEOPLE ACROSS OUR CONTINUE ON. WE USE OUR KEEP DOLLARS TO STAND UP PROBLEM SOLVING FUNDS THAT GIVES FLEXIBLE INFUSIONS OF CASH TO PEOPLE TO QUICKLY RESOLVE PROBLEMS THAT COULD LEAD TO OFFER A LONG MOMENT. HELLO THAT'S LIKE. PAYING BACK RENT. HI THAT CAR REPAIR. WE ALSO CHEAP TO ME CORE PARTS OF OUR SYSTEM LIKE. YOU SHELTER BAD SOLD PLACE THE FAN AND- HOW. ARE HOW. WITH YOUR RECEIVED IN THE SPRING TWENTY TWO HAS ALL. SERVED THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH SIMILAR INTERVENTIONS. BUT WE NEED THE STATE TO PROVIDE ONGOINGFUNDING WHAT WE CAN'T DO IS CONTINUE TO HAVE THE SAME BUDGET FIGHT EACH YEAR AND EXPECT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS STAND OUT NEW PROGRAMS WITH NEW REQUIREMENTS. THAN EXPECTED DATEABLE LASTING REDUCTIONS IN HOMELESSNESS. WE ALSO NEED TO BRING CONTINUES OF CARE TO THE TABLE TO HELP INFORM OUR REGIONAL POLICIES STRATEGY THAT GOES ACROSS DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. UC'S ARE CRITICAL IN MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS THROUGH A REGIONAL APPROACH PARTICULARLY IN LANDSCAPES LIKE LA THAT HAVE A HOST OF OVERLAPPING JURISDICTION. PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS SHOULDN'T BE SERVER BASED ON WHAT SIDE OF THE STREET THEY'RE ON AND THE C. O. C. CAN HELP COORDINATE WITH THE COUNTIES AND THE CITY IS TO LEVERAGE CRITICAL HEALTH CARE AND SAFETY NET RESOURCES- ALONG WITH THE CITIES THAT REGULATE LAND USE AND BRING ALL THIS TOGETHER FOR A HOLISTIC APPROACH. ADDITIONALLY PROVIDING FUNDING TO BUILD OUT AND ENSURE LONG TERM SUCCESS OF PROJECT HOME HE IS CRITICAL TO ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS. PROJECT FROM KEY REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT LEAP FORWARD- WE COMMEND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FIRST YEAR HEADING THAT EFFORT. BUT WE NEED TO CREATE ONGOING FUNDING TO SECURE LONG TERM SICK BACK ONE MINUTE. WE ALSO NEED TO KNOW THAT HOME HE ISN'T THE RIGHT SOLUTION FOR ALL OF OUR POPULATIONS ALMOST YOU FOR EXAMPLE ARE NOT THE MAIN TARGET POPULATION FOR THE INTERVENTION AND THERE'S CONTINUE NEED FOR TAYLOR FUNDING AND SERVICES TO ADDRESS OUR STATE YEAR. THE STATE SHOULD ALSO PUT FORWARD ARCHING VISION A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS FEET WIDE A REPORT FROM THE STATE AUDITOR EARLIER THIS MONTH SHARED THAT WHILE THE STATE HAS MADE CONSIDERABLE. CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENTS IN HOMELESSNESS. THERE HAS BEEN OVER ARCHING STE. OR VISION GUIDE THE INVESTMENT. I BILLS LIKE AB SEVENTY ONE IT WOULD PROVIDE FUNDING THAT WE NEED TO HELP SCALE UP INTERVENTIONS THAT WE KNOW WORK IT WOULD ALSO INCREASE COLLABORATION BETWEEN COUNTIES AND YES. LIKE WE'VE BEEN LIKE I'VE BEEN SAYING NEEDS TO HAPPEN ACROSS THE BOARD AT THE END OF THE DAY IF WE WANT TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT CITIES COUNTIES AND COCS ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO IMPLEMENT A REGIONAL COMPREHENSIVE PLAN THAT ADDRESSES THE NEEDS OF THE ENTIRE. THE ROAD GUIDING VISION THAT WE TO STAY TO BRING WITH WHILE. ONE IS GROUNDED IN AB BASED. WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT COUNT ABILITY AND MEASURABLE GOALS AND COLLABORATION FOR THIS. ACCIDENT THIRTY THAT WE- APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S TIED AND LOOKING FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH ALL OF YOU AND THE WORK THAT WE HAVE. THIS MARCIN THANK YOU SO MUCH- FOR- HANGING WITH THIS FOR YOUR- TODAY. KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN A LONG HEARING AND WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP. I KNOW THAT MISS MARCIN IS GOING TO HAVE ANOTHER MEETING HERE COMING UP AROUND ELEVEN ELEVEN FIFTEEN SO WE'RE GONNA. TRY TO GET THAT QUESTIONS TO HAITI FIRST IN JUST A BIT BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT WE'RE SPANNING THE STATE WE'RE GOING FROM- THE- EAT THE U. S. MEXICO BORDER. NOW UP TO THE CALIFORNIA- OREGON BORDER JUST SOUTH OF THAT AND WE'RE GONNA TURN THIS OVER TO CONNIE BACK COUNTY BACK IS THE DIRECTOR. OF THE HUMBLE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SHE'S GOING TO GIVE US A RURAL COUNTY PERSPECTIVE WE JUST HEARD FROM IN IRVINE COUNTY WE'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR FROM DIRECTOR BACK. FROM HUMBLE- ON HOW. PROJECT ROOM KEY IN HOME KEYS ROLLED OUT THE SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES. DIRECTOR BECKY GOOD MORNING TO YOU IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO SEE YOU ATTHE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES. TO GET A ONE MINUTE AND THIRTY SECOND PROMPT. GOOD MORNING THANK YOU. I AM CALLING BACK HEALTHY. SERVICES DIRECTOR FOR HUMBOLDT. WHEN IT COMES TO HOMELESSNESS WE ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN ANY OF THE BIG CITIES. WHEN YOU DRIVE DOWN HIGHWAY ONE A ONE. DAY YOU WILL SEE MANY OORWAYS OF OUR STOREFRONTS OCCUPIED BY PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TITLE THAT. TRYING TO SLEEP AND STAY WARM. SOME OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE WHEELCHAIRS AND MANY MORE HAVE NO ILLNESS OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. CONGREGATE SHELTERS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO REDUCE CAPACITY AND PEOPLE ONCE AGAIN STARTED RETREATING INTO THE WOODS AND GRAIN BELT. WITH SO MANY LOSING SHELTER PROJECTS ROOM CAN HOME HE HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE DURING THE PANDEMIC. WHEN THE PANDEMIC BEGAN HUMBOLDT COUNTY ACTED FAST TO IMPLEMENT THREE ROOM CHEMO CAL MOTELS ACROSS OUR GEOGRAPHICALLY VAST COUNTY. OUTRAGE WAS SWIFT AS WE EXPERIENCED OUTRAGE PROFESSIONALS AND NO SHORTAGE OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS WITH SEVERE PHYSICAL RISK OF CODING. OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE WITH RICKY HAS BEEN STOPPING. BUT HOW WILL MANY COUNTY SAID EXPERIENCED ACUTE STAFFING CHALLENGES DURING THE PANDEMIC WITH WORKERS HAVING TO CARE FOR CHILDREN AT HOME. OTHERS BEING HIGH RISK THEMSELVES AND STILL OTHERS BEING DEPLOYED ELSEWHERE TO ASSIST WITH COUNTY EMERGENCY OPERATIONS. NONETHELESS RING HERE TO SERVE MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND HUMBOLDT COUNTY REPRESENTING MORE THAN NINETEEN THOUSAND THAT NIGHT. THE INTENT WAS TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET AND INTO NON CONGREGATE SHELTER QUICKLY WHICH WE DID. NOW COMES THE HARD PART RE HOUSING. IN RURAL HUMBOLDT COUNTY THE RENTAL MARKET HAS TIGHTENED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE PANDEMIC. WITH YOUR AVAILABLE UNITS AND RENTS INCREASING DRAMATICALLY AS REMOTE WORKERS FROM OTHER PLACES HAVE CHOSE TO MOVE HERE. WITH LIMITED STAFFING YOU HAVE RENTALS AVAILABLE DWINDLING ROOM HE FINDS AN ONGOING PANDEMIC. WE ARE FEELING THE PRESSURE OF THE SITUATION. THE MOST HELPFUL THING FOR COUNTIES IS FLEXIBLE FUNDING THAT COULD BE USED ACROSS HUMAN SERVICES AND HOUSING PROGRAMS THREE ENTITIES APPLIED FOR HOW HOME KEY AND HUMBOLDT COUNTY TO OUR SUCCESSFUL AND THIS WILL RESULT IN SIXTY NEW UNITS. FOR THE FIRST PROJECT THE COUNTY PARTNERED WITH A LOCAL HOSPITAL SYSTEM THAT PURCHASED A RAM CANNOT TELL THE RESULT WILL BE FORTY TWO NEW PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING UNITS AND SIX OUTPATIENT RECUPERATIVE CARE SO THAT. FOR PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. OKAY FUNDS WERE COMBINED WITH HOUSING FOR A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA HHA HE AND CDBG FUNDING TO MAKE THE PROJECT CANCEL OUT. IMPORTANTLY THE HOSPITAL AGREED TO PROVIDE ALL THE SUPPORT AND SERVICES FOR FUTURE TENANTS WHICH THE COUNTY COULD NOT HAVE AGREED TO THAT COLLABORATION WITHOUT SINCE WE SIMPLY DO NOT HAVE ON GOING FUNDING. OR CAPACITY TO STOP ANOTHER PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROJECT. IN FACT WE DID NOT APPLY FOR THE LATEST ROUND AND NO PLACE LIKE HOME HOME FUNDING FOR THAT SAME REASON. THE SECOND SUCCESSFUL HUNKY APPLICATION WAS SUBMITTED BY THE YUROK TRIBE WHICH IS PARTNERED WITH A LOCAL NONPROFIT SERVICE PROVIDER TO PURCHASE A METALLIC EIGHTEEN BASS. SIGNIFICANTLY BOTH OF THESE HUNKY PROJECTS AND LEAD TO ADDITIONAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE HOSPITAL AND THE TRIBE THAT DID NOT EXIST BEFORE STRENGTHENING THE LOCAL CONTINUUM OF CARE. I MUST NOTE THAT MANY SMALL COUNTIES WERE NOT ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ROOM HERE HUNKY OFTEN BECAUSE OF LACK OF CAPACITY TO PROVIDE THE SUPPORT SERVICES. WHAT ARE THE INSURANCE AND LIABILITY CARRIERS. HOWEVER IMPOSSIBLE IF MORE HUNKY FUNDING IS MADE AVAILABLE OUR CITIES IN LOCAL NONPROFIT STAND READY TO APPLY ONE MINUTE. LASTLY HUMBLE IS THE SMALLEST COUNTY THAT MAINTAINS A SIXTEEN BED PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH FACILITY IN CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS. AS EMERGENCY ROOMS ACROSS THE STATE STRUGGLE WITH CAPACITY DURING BECAUSE OF IT THEY ARE ALSO STRUGGLING TO ADMIT PATIENTS TO PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED INVESTMENT IN BOARDING CARE UNITS IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH HOUSING IT'S ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. SO IS THE STATE'S EFFORT TOWARDS AN IMD WAIVER WAIVER WE MUST EXPAND THE PLACEMENT AND CRISIS RESIDENTIAL OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS ACROSS THE STATE. ENGAGING PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS HASN'T BEEN THE PROBLEM FINDING THE APPROPRIATE THAT TASK. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AND TO BE A PART OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT CONVERSATION. MAN OF DIRECTOR THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS BACK IN ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE WANTED TO HAVE HUMBLED ON NOT ONLY ARE THE RULE BUT BASED OFF OF THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN POINT IN TIME COUNT. HUMBOLDT COUNTY HAS THE HIGHEST POPULATION OF HOMELESSNESS PER CAPITA. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PER CAPITA IN ITS THE THIRD HIGHEST PER CAPITA IN THE NATION- AND UNDERSTANDING THE CHALLENGES THAT RURAL CALIFORNIA FACES. WE'RE NOW GOING TO BE MOVING TO ANOTHER PART OF THE STATE IN THAT'S IN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. WE ARE SO GRATEFUL THAT WE HAVE THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR TURNING POINT THAT WITH US TODAY HER NAME IS JODY CATCH INSIDE AND JODY IS GOING TO BE TALKING TO US ABOUT HER PERSPECTIVE. FROM THE CENTRAL CALIFORNIA REGION ON A PROJECT ROOM KEY AND HOME KEY THAT MADAM EVERY JUDGE RECTOR THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S JERRY CATCHES SIGHT ON THE REGIONAL DIRECTOR FOR TURNING POINT OF CENTRAL CALIFORNIA I SERVE AS THE VICE CHAIR OF THE FRESNO MADERA CONTINUUM OF CARE I ALSO SERVE AS A CSU REPRESENTATIVE ON THE STATE'S ALMOST COORDINATING AND FINANCING COUNCIL ADDITIONALLY I AM THE BOARD CHAIR FOR THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YOUTH AND PARTICIPATE IN THE KINGS TULARE CONTINUUM OF CARE. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY BEFORE CO LEAD OUR REGION HAD THE HIGHEST UNSHELTERED RATE AND THE CAT IN THE COUNTRY WITH OTHER LARGELY- BANK IN THE EIGHT LARGELY URBAN COCS CATEGORY. EMICH STARTED MY STAY HAS BEEN ON TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF HOMELESS CALIFORNIANS AND THAT HAS BEEN A JOB. WITH PROJECT ROOM Q. FUNDS LARRY COUNTY. WAS ABLE TO SHELTER TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE PEOPLE AND THREE MOUNT CHARLES. AND THE CITIES OF TULARE PORTABLE AND BY CELAYA. DURING THE PANDEMIC AT KINGS TULARE CONTINUUM OF CARE PARTICIPATED IN. SIX OF HAD SATURDAY TO ADDRESS YOUTH ALMOST. CHALLENGE TOOK PLACE FROM JUNE TWENTIETH TO OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY- ROOMS THAT WERE UNUSED IN THE ROOM CAME ON TOP OR UTILIZED FOR THIS EFFORT BUT DURING THIS TIME WE WERE ABLE TO HOUSE FORTY YOUTH AND LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR YOUTH ADVISORY BOARD. THAT WILL LAUNCH IN JUNE TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE HAVE USED OUR YOUTH FUNDING TO SET ASIDE BEDS AND NAVIGATION CENTERS. BRIDGE HOUSING AND PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROJECT PROJECTS YES OUR CATIONS WERE VERY SMALL AND RURAL COMMUNITIES TO PUT THIS IN SOME CONTEXT OREO- THAT PORTER VILLE. OUR FOR THE 5% YEARS YOU'RE SATISFIED WITH HE WAS ONLY TWENTY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS. SO WHILE THAT THOSE FUNDS WERE NOT NECESSARILY INTENDED TO DO SATISFIED BEDS THAT'S REALLY ALL THAT COULD BE DONE. WITH THE FUNDING WAS SUCH A SMALL ALLOCATION. REFER HOME CAME. AND KINGS COUNTY TO MOTELS WERE PURCHASED WITH HOME HE FINDS ONE BY THE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY AND ONE BY A PROVIDER. IS ABOUT CHARLES- ARE OPERATING UNDER INTERIM HOUSING CURRENTLY. BUT THEY WILL BE CONVERTED INTO PERMANENT HOUSING WITHIN THE EIGHT YEAR ALLOTTED PERIOD. THE DIFFICULTY AND TULARE COUNTY AS THAT THOUGH THE AWARDS FOR HOME HE ONLY COVER THE ACQUISITION AND SO THEY ARE CURRENTLY SEEKING FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO FINISH THE REHAB SINCE THEN I'M HERE WORD WON'T COVER THAT. SETTING ASIDE CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR YOUTH ONLY PROGRAMS WOULD BE A SUGGESTION MIGHT MAKE SUCH AS WHAT SENATOR WIENER'S PROPOSING THROUGH. HIS S. B. TWO THIRTY FOR CHALLENGING FOR YOUTH PROGRAMS TO COMPETE FOR THE CAPITAL DOLLARS LOCALLY- VARIOUS APPS AND SOMETIMES POLITICAL REASONS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE USING KEEP CASH IN CITY GENERAL FUNDS WE CREATED A PROGRAM IN THE SMALL OWN OF PORTERVILLE WHERE THERE WERE PREVIOUSLY NO SERVICES FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. ESTABLISH A NAVIGATION CENTER WHEREAS. AB TODAY WE HAVE SERVED EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY UNDUPLICATED INDIVIDUALS WITH DAYTIME SERVICES SUCH AS BILLS IN CASE MANAGEMENT OPTS SHELTERED OVER THIRTY ONE INDIVIDUALS. AND SEE AN AVERAGE OF EIGHTY PEOPLE COME THROUGH THE DOORS DALY OUR PERSPECTIVE PORTABLES TWENTY TWENTY POINT IN TIME COUNT NUMBERS WERE JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED UNSHELTERED PEOPLE. PROBABLY KNOW THE PIT COUNTS ARE NOT A PERFECT MEASURE OF HOMELESSNESS IMPOSE SPECIFIC CHALLENGES ESPECIALLY WITH COUNTING HERE THEY DO PROVIDE A WAY FOR COCS TO MEASURE PROGRESS BORDER CROSSING SHELTERED AND UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS ONE IN. IN FRESNO COUNTY JUST ALLOW WEEK WHERE HAVE OPENED. THREE NEW SHELTERS UNDER PROJECT TOM HE FUNDS THAT WILL BE CONVERTED. AT A LATER DATE TO PERMANENT HOUSING AND WITHIN THE FIRST FEW DAYS OF OPENING THERE WERE ALREADY SHELTERING OVER FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE NINETY OF THOSE BEING. CHILDREN SO AS YOU CAN SEE THE ALLOCATION DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RURAL AND URBAN. AREAS CAN BE A- CHALLENGE FOR GETTING THINGS UP AND GOING AND BEING ABLE TO USE THE FUNDS. AND SHELTER PEOPLE QUICKLY. TECHNICALLY THEY ARE RARE THEY ARE AYE RURAL AREAS ARE NOT ENTITLEMENT AREAS WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO IT GET THE FUNDS THAT THEY NEED TO ACTUALLY CONTINUE PROGRAMS AND NOT HAVE TO SHOT THEM. YOU'RE AFTER YOU'RE AS THEY WAIT FOR CONTRA. THANK YOU. GREAT JOB THANK YOU MISTER CATCH SIGHT WORDS SO WE SO APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US AT LEAST IN JENIN IN THE COMMITTEES WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE A TO OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR OUR LOCAL PANELISTS WE'RE GOING TO ASK ALL OF THE PANELISTS FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO PLEASE TURN ON YOUR SCREENS AND WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE QUESTIONS WITH SENATOR DORADO THEY WERE GONNA GO TO CENTER NIELSEN SENATOR PAN THANK YOU SO MUCH I CENTER DRAWS ON THE FLOOR IS YOURS.

THANK YOU SO MUCH OKAY. I'M SORRY EIGHT GOING FINISH YOUR THOUGHT WE'RE GONNA DAY TURNED OUT I WAS JUST GONNA ASK THROUGH WORKING WITH OUR COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT SIR DRAWS- ANY FOLLOW UP ON THAT NINE THANK YOU SO MUCH AND ADDRESS A FOR THAT LAYS IN GERMAN OF THE COMMITTEE WERE NOW BEEN TURNED OVER TO SENATOR NIELSEN. THEY WERE GONNA GO TO SENATOR PAN YOU'RE GONNA GO TO CHAIRWOMAN. HER TITLE. THANK YOU THE PRESIDENT AND- MY- PROTEST. AT THIS. IS MORE. IT OF A- THAN A- BUT IF ANY OF THE LOCAL GUY PRESENTERS WOULD WANT TO COMMENT IT WOULD HELPFUL. I SHOULD WAIT TO TALK IN THIS SECTION BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF OUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS. WITH HOMELESSNESS THE FALLS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND I. WILL POINT TO VARIOUS EXECUTIVE BRANCHES OVER MANY YEARS. N. LEGISLATURES OVER MANY YEARS WHICH OF HELP CREATE THIS PROBLEM. HOW BY DOING A KIND OF A PUNCHES PILOTS TAKING THE PROBLEMS OF THE FALL AND STATE GOVERNMENT AND DUMP IT. ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THAT'S HAPPENED AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THE MOST RECENTLY THE LONG PERIOD OF TIME WHICH IS BEEN CALLED REALIGNMENT. THE REAL ESSENCE OF REALIGNMENT HAS BEEN DUMPING THE STATE'S PROBLEMS. ON THE CITY'S MECHANICS. AND I SPEAK IN THIS SECTION BECAUSE I'M MORE OF A COUNTY PERSON THAN A CITY PERSON. WHAT DO I MEAN. CANDIES HAVE MORE MANDATES. THE FALL ON THEM THE CITIES AND LESSER RESOURCES TO ACCOMPLISH THAT BILITY. TO FIND RESOURCES THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE WELL OFF THEY ARE THEY SET FOR JUST TO SAY. IT OVER THE YEARS THIS STATE IN REALIGNING. AS DR SO MANY. INTO OUR COMMUNITIES MANY OF HOME HAD BECOME THIS GROWING BURGEONING. AN OPPRESSIVE POPULATION. OF HOMELESSNESS. ENDED UP BEING THAT HAS OCCURRED WITHOUT. COMMENSURATE ASSIGNMENT OF RESOURCES TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES COUNTIES CITIES. TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION. THIRTY THREE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS FOR EXAMPLE. AND DANGEROUS INDIVIDUALS HAVE IN ARE BEING PLACED IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND THEY HAVE LITTLE ABILITY TO DEAL WITH THEM. I HEAR WHAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT PEOPLE SAY. AND THEIR FRUSTRATION AT NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO PRO FRIDAY ACCOMMODATIONS IN THE TREATMENT. GENERAL INCULCATED THEN AND WHATEVER WE DO REGARDING. THE HOMELESS. WE NEED TO COUPLE THAT. WITH RESOURCES TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS NOT SIMPLY FIND SHELTER. THAT'S KIND OF A HOLLOW PROMISE. BUT A DRESS SOME OF THE PERSONAL NEEDS OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. I ENVISION SOMETHING LIKE IN THE DUCATION THE I. E. P. INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PLAN MORE BY. THAT INDIVIDUAL HOMELESS PERSON. HIS CHEST AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHAT ARE THEIR NEEDS BEYOND JUST SHELTER. AND THEN HELPED DEVISE A PLAN FOR THAT INDIVIDUAL. TO DEVELOP CAPABILITIES TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES. BE ON THE STREET. AND TO ASSIST THEM. WITH SOME OF THEIR NEEDS. IT WOULD BRING TO PEOPLE'S ATTENTION A CLASSIFICATION OF COUNTIES. OFTEN IT JUST THOUGHT. URBAN AND RURAL. FIVE POINT A NEW TERM NOW THERE'S ALSO BEEN CALLED SUBURBAN COUNTIES. BUT ONE TERM THAT I'VE INVENTED MYSELF THE SUPERVISING COUNTIES THOSE ARE COUNTIES LIKE CONTRA COSTA MAYBE FORTY FIFTY YEARS AGO. OR SOLANO COUNTY MORE RECENTLY THAT I WANT TO REPRESENT THAT ARE TRANSITIONING FROM BEING BASICALLY RURAL COUNTIES. INTO SUBURBAN AND THEN MET WITH EVEN SOME CASES SEVEN CASH. AND THOSE COUNTIES HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS OF NEEDS A PARTICULAR HAVE A HEARTFELT CARING OF THE RURAL. COUNTIES HAVE REPRESENTED NINETEEN DIFFERENT COUNTIES. IN MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE SENATE FROM SANGER WE BOTH GREW UP IN THE SAME TOWN AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE KNOW. THE LACK OF THOSE WHO LIVE IN THOSE VALLEY CITIES AND COUNTIES. SO THE FUNDAMENTAL MESSAGE THAT I MAKE AND IF ANYONE WANTS TO COMMENT I WELCOME. STATE LEGISLATURES AND GOVERNORS. ADMINISTRATIONS NEED TO PAY HE- TWO ONE THREE ALLEVIATE SOME OF OUR BURDENS. AND THEN WE OPPOSE THEM ON OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES WITHOUT SUFFICIENT RESOURCES. TO ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS OF THAT SO CALLED REALIGNED POPULATION. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SO MUCH THE DEAN OF THE SENATE CENTER NIELSEN WE'RE GOING TO QUICKLY GO TO- SUPERVISOR PROVINS REPRESENTING A YELLOW COUNTY SUPERVISOR IF YOU DON'T MIND SIXTY SECOND RESPONSE TO SENATOR NIELSEN PLEASE. YES THANK YOU A CERTAIN NIELSEN I THINK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE AND I'M IN AGREEMENT WITH YOU ABOUT NOT SHIFTING PROGRAMS TO THE COUNTIES THAT WILL RESULT IN A IN A MANDATE AND ADDITIONAL EXPENSES. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LIKE ABOUT THE PROGRAMS LIKE PROJECT ROOM KEY- DURING THE PANDEMIC IS THAT THEY WORK ENTIRELY FINANCED- SO WE DIDN'T HAVE A LOCAL MANAGE BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE WERE ABLE TO ADD% TO THOSE PROGRAMS THAT FOR EXAMPLE RECRUITING LOCAL RESTAURANTS. READ RECRUITING LOCAL SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SERVICES AND- HELP TO THE HOMELESS THAT THAT WASN'T OTHERWISE. COVERED AND I THINK THAT'S AN APPROACH THAT'S PROVING SUCCESSFUL. PROVIDING A PRO TO LOW GOVERNMENT AND ACTUALLY PAYING FOR NINE I WOULD AGREE THAT THAT IS- IS SOMETHING THAT. WE SHOULD DO GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU SO MUCH SUPERVISOR PREVENT THAT FROM YELLOW COUNTY WERE NOW GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MAYOR VIEGAS WALKER FROM THE CITY OF EL CENTRO. I SIXTY SECONDS PLEASE ON THE CENTER. YEAH HE PROBABLY COULDN'T SEE ME WHILE I WAS DOING IT BUT I WAS GIVING US SENATOR NELSON IS A STANDING OVATION I THINK THAT HE HEARKEN BACK TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY. SENATOR EGGMAN EARLIER ON WHICH IS WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS. OF THE FOLKS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT ALREADY. GET TO THE PERSONAL ROOT CAUSES S TO SOME OF THESE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. LIKE IN LIKENING IT TO AN I EP FOR THE HOMELESS I THINK THAT THAT'S ABSOLUTELY. CRITICAL WE DON'T HAVE A CRISIS RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM WITHIN IMPERIAL COUNTY SITE UNITS ARE ALMOST NONEXISTENT THERE'S NO BEDS AVAILABLE FOR THE FOLKS THAT REALLY NEED THEM. PROVIDING HOUSING ONLY IS NOT THE SOLUTION WE HAD A- BAD- REYES KATIE- PERSON COME IN AND DO FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF DAMAGE TO A HOTEL ROOM. THAT'S BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT IT SHOULD THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN SCREENED OUT THEY WERE NOT PROVIDED WITH THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES THAT THEYNEED IT SO. IT'S NOT JUST ENOUGH WE ALL KNOW IS NOT JUST ENOUGH TO. GIVE SOMEONE OF PLACE TO. TO SHOWER AND GET READY TO FACE THE DAY WE REALLY HAVE TO PROVIDE THEM. WITH THAT- WRAPAROUND SERVICE COMPONENT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU SO MUCH MAYOR. ALL RIGHTY THANK YU VERY MUCH SOONER. A LAYS IN GERMAN COMMITTEE WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO SENATOR PAN. HE'S VERY MUCH- OF A SHARE AND- CENTERS AS WELL- I GUESS EVAN DID WANT TO TOUCH ON- ISSUE DOES RAISE BY- THIS- VEGAS WALKER TO MAYOR MAYOR IS WALKER AND FIRST OF ALL THE SLICE BEGAN ASSN DO I RECOGNIZE THE SUPERVISOR PREVENTS- WHO- HIS SUPERVISOR AND YELLOW COUNTY WHICH- PART OF WHICH I DO REPRESENT- SO. ONE THREE THE END THIS HERE WE START OFF BY TWO ABOUT. THE FACT THAT WE NEED A GREATER SUPPLY OF HOUSING- IN MANY CASES NOT ALL OF THOSE DECISIONS BUT- THOSE ASIANS ARE LAND USE DECISIONS MADE BY CITIES AND SOME ARE MADE BY COUNTIES- SAME TIME WE TALK ABOUT WRAPAROUND SERVICES- AND I KNOW THAT IS- SOMEONE DO WITH THE PASTURE OF- BUT JUST SOME THREE THAT. A LOT OF THAT IS ACTUALLY DELEGATED TO COUNTIES AND APPRECIATE- CENTER NIELSEN BRING UP SOME OF THAT ISSUE AS WELL- SO. I GUESS THE QUESTION I HAVE IS THE INTEGRATION BETWEEN CITY DECISION MAKING WHICH INVOLVES LAND USE AND- YOU KNOW HOUSING. WITH COUNTY CELLS COUNTY SOMETIMES AS HAVE COUNTY PROPERTY IN OKAY. IT THAT THAT THAT HAS LAND USE OF SCARCE COUNTY LAND BUT THEN THERE'S THE CITIES AND THEN BUT YET. ALSO TO SOCIAL SERVICES AT LEAST AMPLE MENTAL HEALTH OF MEDICARE HOW. BASICALLY FOR SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH- BASICALLY DEPENDS ON COUNTY. BEHAVIOR HEALTH PLANS- THAT'S- THAT'S HOW WE IN FACT WE GIVE QUITE A BIT OF AUTONOMY TO COUNTIES IN TERMS OF. THE COUNTY HEALTH. BEHAVIOR HEALTH PLANS- SO HOW DO SOME TO AND SOMETIMES HAT TO DON'T COME TOGETHER AND I SPENT FORTY SEEN THIS IN MY OWN DISTRICT- SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO GET BETTER COLLABORATION BETWEEN CITIES AND COUNTIES AND OTHER LOCAL ENTITIES IN TERMS OF TRYING TO. ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND BE SURE YOU HAVE THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES WHICH ARE OFTEN TIMES THE RESOURCES ARE DIRECTED TO COUNTIES. HOW DO WE GET BETTER LAND USE DECISIONS- THAT HELP US INCREASE HOUSING SOME OF WHICH ARE DONE BY COUNTIES BUT ACTUALLY SEE- DONE BY CITIES- AND FOR EXAMPLE MICE AND SEE HERE SACRAMENTO ACTUALLY FORTUNATELY DID TAKE STEPS TO TRY TO INCREASE- HOUSING BY ALLOWING. US TO THEIR ZONING DECISIONS- ALLOWING- HILLS AND. SINGLE FAMILY HOME AREAS TO HAVE- TO HAVE DUPLEXES AND- IN SO FORTH- THIS WHAT WHAT CAN WE TO BRING THESE THINGS TO- WHEN IT COMES TRYING TO DRESS BOTH HOMELESS. AND OF COURSE FLAT HOUSING THAT IS DRIVING HOME LISTED ALSO IS ONE OF THE DRIVERS OF HOMELESSNESS. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER PAN- WE'RE GOING TO FIRST GO TO. MAYOR VIEGAS WALKER- MAYOR PLEASE. WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU SIXTY SECONDS FOR EACH OF THE- QUESTIONS SO FIRST AND FOREMOST. WHAT CAN BE DONE TO HAVE BETTER COLLABORATION BETWEEN CITIES AND COUNTIES. N. E. POINTED OUT THAT YOU'RE TAKING THE BALL COMPARE FREEZING HERE CITIES ARE TAKING THE BULK OF THE ROOMS IN REGARDS TO PROJECT ON KEY. AND THEN THE SECOND PIECE IS WHAT CAN CITIES DO- THEY HAVE- BETTER DECISION MAKING WHEN IT COMES ELAINE USED TO BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE HOUSING AS WELL SO LET'S GO TO THAT FIRST ONE IMMIGRANTS A COLLABORATION SIXTY SECONDS IN SIXTY SECONDS FOR. EXPEDITING HOUSING. AGAIN I THINK I WANT TO COME BACK YOU JUST GOT A WHOLE LOT OF BRILLIANCE IN THE ROOM EARLIER ON SENATOR CAVALEIRO TALKED ABOUT METRICS ACCOUNTABILITY EQUITY AND I'M GOING TO ADD A- FOURTH ONE AND THAT IS TRANSPARENCY AND I WOULD JUST SIMPLY GO BACK OUT TO THE COUNTIES AND SAY. HOW ARE YOU COLLABORATING WITH YOUR CITIS. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IT WOULD BE COUNTY BUT THERE NEEDED BY THE CITIES TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES RELATED TO HOMELESSNESS HOW IS THAT COLLABORATION- OCCURRING. THIS WEEK WE CAN HAVE ARE HANDLED BUT IN LESLIE COUNTY IS WILLING FOR THOSE DOLLARS TO FLOW INTO OUR COFFERS WERE TO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN SO I WOULD I WOULD JUST ASK FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE COUNTY LEVEL. SAYING HOW ARE YOU COLLABORATING- WITH YOUR WITH YOUR UNCLE COOL COOL PART SAID THAT AT THE- AT THE CITY LEVEL. AND THEN WITH REGARD TO LAND USE THAT'S THAT'S ABSOLUTELY SPOT ON WE KNOW THAT IN A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS WITHIN THE CITY. AND IT MAKES MUCH MORE SENSE FOR THAT THE RESIDENTS TO BE RESIDING WITHIN THE CITIES TO PREVENT THE URBAN. SPRAWL AND EVERYTHING ELSE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SO. I REALLY. THINK THAT THE LAND USE. AND HOUSING GOES HAND HAND IS. THERE NEEDS TO BE THE- INTO. FOR K. TO ON TO WORK DIRECTLY WITH CITIES ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PEACE. THANK YOU SO MUCH- IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH CENTER PAN WERE NOW GOING TO GO TO SUPERVISOR PREVENTIVA AT BETTER COLLABORATION BETWEEN COUNTIES AND CITIES WHEN IT COMES TO THESE PROJECTS IN WHAT CAN BE DONE TO BE A INCENTIVIZE. HOUSING SUPERVISOR BERMAN SAID YOLO COUNTY. BETWEEN THE CITIES AND THE COUNTY AND THE REASON WE WERE ABLE TO LISTEN WE WERE ALREADY COLLABORATING ON HOMELESS ISSUES WE MEET REGULARLY. ON HOMELESS ISSUES THAT CITY AND THE COUNTY- ALL THE CITIES AND THE COUNTY MEET REGULARLY AND- WE PROVIDE THE SOCIAL SERVICES. AND THEN THE CITY WILL UP PURCHASE- THE BUILDINGS OR RENT THE BUILDINGS- THAT THEY TOOK CARE OF THE HOTEL ROOMS PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY OF DAVIS DID A- A DAY CENTER FOR THE HOMELESS- COUNTY PAID HALF THE COST. AND THEN ALSO PROVIDED THE SOCIAL SERVICES WE DON'T LOOK AT IT AS A CITY OR COUNT ISSUE WE LOOK AT IT AS SOMETHING THAT WE JOINTLY DO TOGETHER. AND ARE R. C. A. O. IN OUR CITY MANAGER SIT DOWN AND DISCUSS WHO'S GOING TO DO WHAT AND THEN WE DO IT. AND BECAUSE OF THAT ONE WHEN WE WENT INTO THE PROJECT ROOM KEEP WEEK WE WERE SET UP FOR THAT WE ALREADY HAD. THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND I THINK WHAT CAN BE DONE TO ENCOURAGE IT IS AT THE LEVEL LOCAL LEVEL- THERE NEEDS TO BE A COMMITMENT TO FOCUS ON PROBLEMS S. AS A REGIONAL PROBLEM WITH IT RATHER THAN AS A CITY. OR COUNTY PROJECT IT CAN BE IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DO BUT WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT AND I'M GOING BASIS. I THINK IT'S SO LESS OF A CHALLENGE. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF A VISOR GOING TO TURN IT BACK OVER TO- SENATOR PAN QUICKLY ON YET SO I GUESS MY IN THE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT FOR EXAMPLE YELLOW COUNTY I'M GLAD YOU'RE DOING THAT ARE READY. WHAT HAPPENED WHAT SHOULD WHAT SHOULD THE STATE TO I'M ASKING VOCAL BILL BECAUSE WE WANT YOUR INPUT. AS TO TOO FAR LIKE WHAT CAN WE DO TO FOSTER MORE THAT COLLABORATION SO IT'S GREAT FOR ITS HAPPENING THE PROBLEM IS WHEN IT'S NOT HAPPENING. THE REAL PROBLEMS AND SO WHAT WHAT IS IT I MEAN WE DON'T HAVE THE CAMERAS AT PEOPLE BUTWHAT SHOULD WE BE DOING AS AT THE STATE TO. GET MORE PEOPLE TO DO THAT LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING ANY OTHER COUNTY SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER MAYBE WHAT SOME OF THE OTHER SPEAKER WANT OTHER SPEAKERS MY WHITE DRESS THAT WOULD BE MY HAVE LAMAR CHALLENGE. WITH THIS COLLABORATION. ABSOLUTELY SO LET'S OPEN IT UP I'M WORKING ASK. FOR THIRTY SO RESPONSE IS JUST. OF AND I- WE- HAD A MARTIN LA. HAD TO ANOTHER. BUT WHEN OF THE ITEMS THAT. SHE IS BEEN HAVING. IS THEY HAVE A JOB. JOY POWER AUTHORITY. BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE COUNTY ON DECISION MAKING IN FINDING. OUT WHICH- HAS HELPED STREAMLINE. BUT THAT'S THE TURN IT OVER TO- IS CRITICIZED. FROM TURNING POINT. WHAT CAN THE STATE DO TO HELP EXPEDITE SERVICES AND HOUSING- EXCEL IN. IN MY NECK OF THE WOODS WE HAD. A REALLY GOOD EXPERIENCE WHEN WE HAD FUNDS THAT WERE ALLOCATED TO. THE CONTINUUM OF CARE AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE- BOTH THE COUNTIES AND THE CITY AND ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE. YEAH OF THE CONTINUE ON THE ABILITY TO. YOU KNOW LOOK AT AT WHAT THE NEEDS WERE LOOK AT THE DATA AND BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT. WHAT TYPES OF INTERVENTIONS WERE NEEDED AND THIS IS WITH KEEP AND CASH AS THOSE WERE. ZERO C. ALLOCATIONS WE'RE ABLE TO LOOK AT WHAT WAS NEEDED. AND THEN THE CITIES AND THE COUNTIES CAME TO THE C. O. C. WITH. A PLANAND THE C. O. C. VOTED. ON IT. SO IT WAS. IT IT WHAT IT WAS LIKE A NATURAL COLLABORATION BECAUSE IT WAS A REQUIREMENT THAT THE COCS BATTED WHAT THE FUNDING WOULD BE USED FOR- AND THAT CAN BE DONE IN OTHER WAYS LIKE IF THE IF THE MONEY IS NOT ALLOCATED TO THE CEO SEEN. CITIES AND COUNTIES COULD BE REQUIRED WHEN THEY PUT IN APPLICATIONS TO GET A LETTER FROM THE CEO SEE VERIFYING THAT THEY DIDN'T RUN IT THROUGH. INTERNET RUN THEIR PLAN THROUGH THIS YEAR- STANDBY INPUT. BACK FROM THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING THE SERVICES- AND ANOTHER MODEL THAT WORKS WELL IN JURISDICTIONS I THINK THAT WHERE THE CITY AND THE COUNTY. MAY NOT PLAY AS NICE TO GATHER IS ONE NON PROFITS ARE OFTEN ARE OPERATING THE PROGRAM THEN THEY HAVE THE PARTNERSHIPS TO MAKES THOSE. SERVICES ACCESSIBLE TO THE EIGHT RESIDENTS OUT OF ANY PROGRAM- AN EXAMPLE IS WITH OUR HOME HE FINDS WE- ARE HOUSING AUTHORITY BOUGHT THE BUILDINGS TURNING POINT AS AN AGENCY THAT'S OPERATING THREE OF THEM AND WE LIKE FOLKS THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. SO AND THAT IS ARE YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN WORK REALLY WELL IN THE PAST. YES HE DID GIVE HIS CONSENT AND BRINGING TANGIBLE EXAMPLES TO THE TABLE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT RESPECT WE'RE GOING TO ASK YOU- SENATOR PAN **** BEST WAYS WOULD EXPEDITE HOUSING- WITH CITIES AND COUNTIES- YOUR PERSPECTIVE PLEASE WE'RE GONNA ASK FOR THIRTY SECONDS. EXCUSE. ME SIXTY SECONDS APOLOGIZE. THANK YOU I. AM HUMBOLDT COUNTY I THINK WE- WORK PRETTY WITH TO LARGER CITIES IN. I'M HAVE SOME PRETTY GOOD PROGRAMS. AND I. FEEL LIKE THEY CONTINUE OF CARE STRUCTURE AND- I THINK THAT WE COULD WORK ON NOT STRUCTURE SO THAT ALL COUNTIES HAVE A GATE CONTINUUM OF CARE I THINK THAT THERE ARE AND SOME STRUCTURES THAT DON'T WORK AS WELL AS OTHER OTHERS SO I THINK THAT THAT THAT MAY BE AN OPTION AND- I DO LIKE AND THAT ALL. OF OUR NON PROFITS AND FOLKS THAT WORK AND WITH THE COUNTY AND THE CITIES ACTUALLY ARE A PART OF THAT CONTINUUM OF CARE AND NOT DECISION MAKING PROCESS I THINK THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL. AND YEAH THANK YOU SO MUCH READING DIRECTOR ALL RIGHT THANK YOU TO THAT THE PANEL ON THAT WE NOW GOING TO GO DO THANK YOU SENATOR PAN OUT FOR THE REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED TODAY VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT SIR- THAT'S TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR PER TILE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I GUESS I'M JUST IT'S NOT SO MUCH OF A QUESTION BUT JUST TRYING TO GET MORE OF AN UNDERSTANDING I USED TO BE I COME FROM THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND I GET THE UNDERSTOOD THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE WHEN IT COMES TO GROWTH WHEN IT COMES TO. MORE HOUSING BUT I AM TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE THAT. LAST GOAL PLEASE AND IN TERMS OF GROWTH AND- OUT WHEN IT COMES TO. A BUILDING MARK EIGHT- HOMES OR OR OR JUST BEING ABLE TO. SUSTAIN THE GROWING POPULATION THAT WE HAVE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO THE RISING HOMELESSNESS- SITUATION WOULD HAPPEN IN THE STATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS CENTER TIDO. LET'S GO TO IF IT'S ALRIGHT AT ANY COMMENTS- TO SEND HER TITLE MISS CATCH INSIDE. FROM TURNING POINT. THIRTY MARK AND I AM SORRY. EXACTLY YEAH THE FLOOR IS YOURS MA'AM. AND I THINK THAT. NOT REALLY I MEAN TO BE HONEST I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW TO RESPOND TO HER COMMENTS AND- I DO THINK OF THAT. CONTINUUM'S OF CARE ARE AN IMPORTANT PART AS THE DECISION MAKING AND JURISDICTIONS- AND I AM I MEAN ULTIMATELY LIKE I THINK. I'VE COVERED A LOT IN TERMS OF WHAT HER COMMENTS WERE SO IS THERE A SPECIFIC QUESTIONS NO IT'S GOOD YOU'RE GOOD JUDY THANK YOU SO MUCH SUPERVISOR PREVENTIVA YOLO COUNTY- COUNTY WITH THE CONTINUED CARE ANY COMMENTS ON THAT. YOUR NEED SIR I'M SORRY. GOOD OKAY THANK YOU I THINK THE CONTINUUM OF CARE IS THAT A GOOD CONCEPT I WHO ONE OF OUR PROBLEMS HAS BEEN BIFURCATION OF FUNDING- IN VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND THEN BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE COUNTY AND I THINK THAT'S FUNDING A REGIONAL EFFORT THAT MIGHT INCLUDE CONTINUUM OF CARE IS PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA. WE WERE STRUGGLING WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO ESTABLISH CITY COUNTY. OPERATION BECAUSE OF THE BIFURCATION CARE MORE RECENTLY- THAT THE PROJECT ROOM KEY WE WERE WE WERE ABLE TO GET REIMBURSEMENT FROM ALMOST EVERYTHING WE DID INCLUDING- WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND BY COOPERATION THAT THAT THAT EXISTED I HAVE A STRONG PROGRAM BUT I THINK THE BIFURCATION OF FUNDING CURRENTLY- CAN BE A PROBLEM AND- IF THERE WAS A- A REGIONAL APPROACH TO FUNDING I THINK YOU SEE MORE RAD MORE OF A REGIONAL EFFORT. UP I'M NOT AWARE OF LASKO HAVING A ROLE THEY HAVEN'T HAD A ROLE IN OUR COUNTY- BUT- I THINK THE HOUSING AUTHORITIES AND SO FORTH SO WE WORK WITH- AS WELL AS RECOGNIZING THE DIFFERENT ROLES OF GOVERNMENT AND- WORKING TOGETHER TO TRY TO ACHIEVE A COMMON GOAL I DO UNDERSTAND- THE ISSUE OF- MAYBE HOUSING NOT BEING APPROVED. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE ALL STRUGGLE WITH THAT KIND OF THE NBS OF THE CURRY SOMETIMES I THINK THAT'S- CHANGING SOMEWHAT BUT- IF WE DON'T BUILD HOUSING. WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIS. I DID IS BEING- IT. CONVERSATION WITH LEADERS WHERE THEY'RE FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEADERS FROM NONPROFIT AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAMS IN THE SERVICES ON THE GROUND WITH PROJECT RONCHI ROOM KEY AND HOME KEY WE WANT TO SAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU TO SUPERVISOR PREVENTS THAT THANK YOU TO MAYOR VIEGAS WALKER THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS MARTIN FROM. LOS ANGELES WE WANT TO THANK YOU I DO MISS GETS ASSIGNED REPRESENTING TURNING POINT IN OF COURSE MISS BACK REPRESENTING THE COUNTY OF HUMBOLDT. WE OWE YOU A DEBT OF GRATITUDE WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR INCREDIBLE WORK DURING THESE CHALLENGING TIMES AND THIS IS BEEN A WONDERFUL PANEL THANK YOU SO MUCH. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN OF THE COMMITTEE WE HEARD FROM- THE STATE WE'VE HEARD FROM LOCAL LEADERS AND NOW WE'VE GOT TO BE TO TURN IT OVER TO SUPERVISOR OR A SUPERVISOR SENATOR WIENER FORMER SUPERVISOR I MIGHT ADD- TO BE ABLE TO RUN OUR LAST PANEL. ON TRANSITIONAL USE. THE FOR SURE SIR. THANK YOU ONE A SUPER. OR IS- SO I ALREADY A PREVIEW INTRODUCED- THE PANEL WHEN I'M IS A GOMEZ- SPOKE ABOUT THE NEEDS OF OUR TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH IN TERMS OF HOMELESSNESS- AND SO WE NOW WILL GO TO THE- OTHERS SPEAKERS ON A PANEL ROBIN ROSE HAMMER WHO'S THE DIRECTOR OF HOUSING SERVICES AT THE SACK SACRAMENTO LGBT. COMMUNITY CENTER I DO JUST WANT TO KNOW- THAT- ONE OF THE MANY REASONS THAT I'VE BEEN SO INVOLVED OVER THE YEARS AROUND YOUTH HOMELESSNESS- IS ON MY OWN COMMUNITY THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY IS HEAVILY OVER REPRESENTED AMONG HOMELESS USE- ABOUT 40% OR MORE OF HOMELESS YOUTH IDENTIFY AS LGBTQ. SO THIS IS A CRISIS FOR YOUTH IN GENERAL BUT PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNG LGBTQ PEOPLE WHO ARE SO DEEPLY AT RISK- EITHER ARE RUNNING AWAY FROM HOME OR BEING KICKED OUT OF THEIR HOME- AND- AND SO IT'S REALLY US STRUGGLING AND LOCKING THE SUPPORT THAT THEY- NEED SO SACRAMENTO LGBT COMMUNITY CENTER THOSE TERRIFIC WORK AS- DO OTHER LGBT. CENTERS AND PROGRAMS AROUND THE STATE- SO WITHOUT WILL TURN OVER. TO ROBIN ROSE HAMMER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR KIND INVITATION MY NAME IS ROBIN ROSE HAMMER AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF HOUSING SERVICES FOR THE SACRAMENTO LGBT COMMUNITY CENTER. I'D LIKE TO THINK OF ON WATSON CAN LUIS FROM THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YOUTH FOR RAISING THESE ISSUES AND SOME RESEARCH SAY FOR THAT KIND OF ATTENTION TO SPEAK TODAY. YOUR BACKGROUND PAPER PRESENTED REFLECTS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES IN IDENTIFICATION AND QUANTIFICATION OF THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL LAYER FOR TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH AS THEY DO NOT FIT THE HOMELESS DEFINITION DEFINITION PRESCRIBES BY HEAD AND FREQUENTLY COUCH SURF. OR REMAIN INVISIBLE FOR SAFETY. THERE ARE VERY DIFFERENT NEEDS FOR TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH THEIR AGES AND STAGES DICTATE. A CERTAIN LEVEL OF. SUPPORT THAT IS NOT TYPICALLY PROVIDED IN PROGRAMS AND I'M SURE THAT THOSE OF YOU WHO'VE EVER LIVED WITH OR NOT A TEENAGER ARE KEENLY AWARE OF THE UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT THEIR AGE GROUP PRESENTS IN TERMS OF EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT. THIS OCCURS IN COHABITATION IN CONJUNCTION AND IT'S EXACERBATED BY ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. GENERATIONAL TRAUMA AND POVERTY. THERE IS A REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH HAS BEEN WIDELY DISCUSSED HERE TODAY BUT IT PUTS A DOWNWARD SQUEEZE ON THE LESS ADEPT AT NEGOTIATING THOSE COMPLEX SYSTEMS. TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE CHOSEN AS A CANDIDATE FOR THOSE HOUSING PROGRAMS AS THEY HAVE LESS ESTABLISH CREDIT SHORTER EMPLOYMENT HISTORY AND GREATER TRANSIENTS. IN SACRAMENTO WE HAVE FANTASTIC CHALLENGES AND WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE MANY DIVERSE PROGRAM PROGRAMS WHICH IS FANTASTIC BUT THERE ARE TOO FEW SPOTS IN THOSE INNOVATIONS WHICH IS REALLY NOT GOOD. THE TOTAL OF SPOTS IS NOT IS LESS THAN 25% OF THE IDENTIFIED YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS FROM THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN POINT IN TIME COUNT. WHICH HAS POSTULATED TO HAVE BEEN AS MUCH AS A 75% UNDER COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS DUE TO THE NATURE OF YOUTH HOMELESSNESS WHICH IS HIGHLY INVISIBLE. WE HAVE HAD AN INCREASE NEED FOR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING AS YOUTH IN THE SHELTER HAVE NO WHERE TO EXIT. WE RECEIVED USED INTO OUR SHELTER FROM OTHER SHELTERS AS MANY OTHER LOCAL PROBLEM PROGRAMS HAVE THE SAME EXIT CHALLENGES. AND WE BELIEVE THAT COATED STANDS TO EXACERBATE THIS IS CURRENTLY HOUSED FAMILIES ARE BECOMING UNSTABLE. TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH ARE VULNERABLE BECAUSE THEY'RE ADULTS AND SO FAMILIES PEELED OFF IN AN EFFORT TO STATE HOUSE PARTICULARLY WHEN THEY'RE COMBINING HOUSEHOLDS WITH OTHER UNSTABLE FOLKS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT FROM THE LAST RECESSION YOUNG PEOPLE PARTICULARLY AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LGBTQ YOUTH WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY DISADVANTAGED AND WE STAND TO REPEAT THIS RECENT HISTORY WITHOUT PROACTIVE ACTION. SO WHAT DO WE NEED. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN USE IDENTIFIED AS THE SECOND HIGHEST PRIORITY AFTER MORE HOUSING EMPLOYMENT. SOLID RELIABLE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMING THAT LEADS TO TANGIBLE EMPLOYMENT. EASY TO ENTER EASY TO ACCESS AND PROGRAMS THAT FOLKS CAN BENEFIT FROM WITH PROGRAM CONSIDERATIONS THAT INCLUDE THINGS LIKE TRANSPORTATION. STIPENDS AND PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES. TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH HAVE MULTI FACETED NEEDS AND THAT'S WHY PROGRAMS HAVE TO BE CREATED AND DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO MEET THEM WHERE THEY ARE. THE DATA SUGGESTS THAT UPWARDS OF 50% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DESIGNATED CHRONICALLY HOMELESS NOW WE'RE HOMELESS AS YOU. THIS IS A SOLVABLE PROBLEM IF YOU START NOW BY PRIORITIZING YOU. WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING AS OPPOSED TO. IT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR YOUTH PROGRAMS. AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE APPRECIATE THOSE WHO UNDERSTAND AND DIFFERENT DIFFERENTIATE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN HOW THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. AND THE DEEPENING NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. OUR CURRENT CONCERN IS DEFINITELY BOTH ENDS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH OF FOR THOSE ELOQUENT COMMENTS AND WE SO APPRECIATE YOU BEING WITH US TODAY AND HANG IN WITH US- DURING THIS HEARING IS WELL ALL RIGHT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE COMMITTEES WITH ACTIVATED OPEN IT UP FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- I KNOW I HAVE A COUPLE BUT WE WANT TO SEE THOSE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. BY THE COMMITTEE AT THIS TIME QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ALL RIGHT AT WOULD LIKE TO BE TO SEE MISS ROSE HAMER CAN YOU TALK TO US ABOUT. THE SO MUCH OF THE FUNDING IT'S COMING DOWN. IS THAT LET'S FOCUS ON PROJECT ESPECIALLY HAVING A TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH BEING ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE UNITS NUMBER ONE- AND BEING CHRONIC HOMELESS SIX ADDRESS TALK TO US ABOUT THE CHALLENGES IN FUNDING HAD TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS HOUSING IN THIS FORMULA IN WHICH THE STATE HAS ADDRESSED. SO IN YOU VERY ABSOLUTELY HIT THE NAIL ON THE HEAD TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH DO NOT ACCESS PROJECT TWENTY THE BOTTOM LINE IS THOSE PROGRAMS ARE TYPICALLY ACCESSED THROUGH ADULT SHELTERS. AND ADULTS- OUTREACH YEP AND USE ARE NOT FOUND IN THOSE SPACES SO UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF RESOURCES BEING ALLOCATED TOWARD THE MILLION RATIONS OF. THE HOMELESSNESS ISSUE BUT THAT DOES NOT TOUCH TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH AS THEY'RE NOT IN THOSE SPACES. YEAH AND I THINK THAT'S THE AGAIN AND I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH AND DIRECTOR BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE CHALLENGES FACED BY TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH THE GAP NOW JUST GOTTEN WIDER BUT I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH SO. TALK TO US IN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. SO THE REALITY IS THAT THE- PARTNERSHIPS THAT. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVE. THE POPULATION OF TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH AND PARTICULARLY LGBT YOUTH. THANK IN PARTICULAR- THAT ROLE CAN'T BE UNDERSTATED AND THERE ARE LOTS OF REALLY GREAT USES FOR GOVERNMENT AND LARGE PROGRAMS LIKE ONE BY CITIES AND COUNTIES. BUT THE REALITY IS THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND FOLKS THAT WORK WITH YOUTH. ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS ARE THE ABSOLUTE BEST STRATEGY FOR BEING ABLE TO. REDUCE AND ELIMINATE YOUTH HOMELESSNESS. AND GETTING RESOURCES INTO THE HANDS OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING THOSE PROGRAMS SHOULD BE A PRIORITY. AREAS HAS BEEN AN 88% SET ASIDE THAT WAS DESIGNATED. BY STATUTE FOR BOTH KEEP AND HAPPY. AND THAT IS COMPLETELY INSUFFICIENT TO BE ABLE TO- ADDRESS AND- NEGOTIATE. THE PROBLEM. I THINK THE OTHER PIECES HE SAID AT SO MANY OF THESE. YOUTHS ARE POTENTIALLY COMING OUT OF THE FOSTER SYSTEM HERE. IN CALIFORNIA IN THIS JUST BE CANDID- UNDERFUNDED AS WELL- ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO SERVICES AFTER THE AGE OUT OF THE SYSTEM. SO IN ADDITION TO HAVING TO TRY TO SECURE. SHELTER SHOULD SECURE- A ROOM. AT THE VERY MINIMUM. THEY'RE DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES DETENTION CENTERS ABUSE. I MEAN IT'S- A LIFETIME OF CHALLENGES IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON. THAT AND THEN WE'LL GO TO SENATOR WIENER. I'D BE HAPPY TO. THE RIYADH IS THAT OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM DOES THE VERY BEST YOU CAN WITH THE RESOURCES THAT IT HAS AVAILABLE BUT IT'S A POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR- NATURAL AND- ORGANIC FAMILIES. AND ANYONE OF US IS RAISED A CHILD KNOWS THAT THE COST IS NOT JUST FINANCIAL THERE'S ALSO ALMOST ON PSYCHOLOGICAL COSTS FOR RAISING A CHILD AND IF THERE AREN'T FOLKS AROUND TO BE ABLE TO POUR INTO THE YOUNG PEOPLE. WHO ARE LIVING IN THEIR HOMES OR THOSE HOUSES ARE DYSFUNCTIONAL IT ONLY EXACERBATES THE PROBLEMS. THAT ARE EXPERIENCED BY TEENAGERS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST GOING THROUGH THE NORMAL PSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTAL CHALLENGES OF BEING A YOUNG PERSON- THE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO TRANSITION A YOUNG PERSON FROM BEING. FULLY CARED FOR IN A HOME TO. I CALL IT LAUNCHING INTO ADULTHOOD ARE TREMENDOUS AND ALMOST NOT QUANTIFIABLE IF YOU'RE ADDING A DOLLAR FIGURE TO IT SO THERE IS A DEEP NEED FOR QUALITY PROGRAM DEVELOPMENTS. THAT ADDRESSES ALL OF THE ASPECTS OF LAUNCHING AND MOST OF OUR FOSTER CARE PROGRAMS DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AND OR THE BAND WITH TO BE ABLE TO CREATE THAT KIND OF COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAMMING. ALSO NGUYEN YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MOVING INTO OTHER SYSTEMS LIKE HIGHER EDUCATION THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT THOSE SYSTEMS ARE INTACT AND FOLKS GO INTO HIGHER ED AND HEAD OFF TO THE COLLEGE OF THEIR CHOICE AND THEN THERE'S NOT HOUSING THERE. FOR THEM TO GO TO THAT AND THEN ADDS AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF STRESS AND THAT AND YOU CAN'T FIND HOUSING WHERE YOU'VE DECIDED O GO TO COLLEGE. SO HIGHER ED HAS THAT CHALLENGES WELL IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE SUPPORTING. INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING NO THANK YOU SO MUCH I DID NOT MEAN TO I CUT YOU OFF I JUST READ ABOUT FIVE MINUTES LEFT- AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE CENTER. WIENER I AND I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU CENTER WIENER FOR A- THIS PAIN. RIGHT TO THE HARING IT WAS THREE YEARS. SO CENTER WINNER THE FLOORS ARE. THANK YOU ARE THE I WAS VERY- PUBLIC I WANT TO ECHO- FRANKLY THE FRUSTRATION. ON THAT CALIFORNIA. REALLY HAS NOT EVEN COME CLOSE TO A NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF COMMITTING. FIVE TO END YOUTH HOMELESSNESS WHICH WE CAN DO. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE HOMES IS CONSIDERED SO DAUNTING IN SO MANY WAYS. WE HAVE IT WITHIN OUR POWER TO AND USE HOMELESSNESS. AND THE STATE HAS SIMPLY CHOSEN NOT TO DO SO- I MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT FIVE SIX YEARS AGO. CALIFORNIA WAS SPENDING APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN DEDICATED YOUTH HOMELESS FUNDING. ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE ENTIRE CITY CALIFORNIA. WE WERE ABLE TO GET UP TO TEN MILLION A YEAR WE'VE GOT IT ALL MORE FROM THERE BUT IT IS STILL. QUITE LOW COMPARED TO WHAT WE NEED AND THEY MENTIONED EARLIER MOST COUNTIES A COUPLE YEARS AGO WITH TWO THIRDS OF CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. LITERALLY HAVE NO. USE SPECIFIC ALMOST PROGRAMS. THE KIDS SUPPOSED TO ONE OF HIS FIRST DO. I WAS IN FRESNO YOU YEAR AND A HALF AGO FOR THEIR PRIDE CELEBRATION. AND I MET A GENTLEMAN WHO JUST. RUNS A YOUTH NONPROFIT. HE OPENED UP FRESNO'S FIRST USE HOMELESS SHELTER WITH TWENTY FIVE BEDS ON THE FIRST NIGHT FOUR HUNDRED KIDS SHOWED UP FOR THOSE TWENTY FIVE DEBTS. AND SO WE ARE AND EVERY YEAR IN THE BUDGET WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THAT YOU SET ASIDE BUT YOU JUST HEARD. WE HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT IN THE BUDGET EVERY YEAR FOR THAT ADEQUATE SET ASIDE SO WE NEED TO WE HAVE WE HAVE SOME FUNDING FLEXIBILITY THIS YEAR THANKFULLY- WE NEED TO. HAVE SOME SOME MORE ONE TIME FUNDING FOR HOUSING. BUT WE NEED TO RETURN THAT TO YEAR AFTER YEAR MAKING INVESTMENTS WE NEED. TO REALLY AND YOUR HOME SO IT IS A MORAL FAILURE THAT. WE HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE LIVING ON OUR STREETS.

CONTRIBUTE ANNUALLY OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING FOR CAROLINE AND HOMELESSNESS SERVICES. NOT INCLUDING FEDERAL FUNDING IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WITHIN THE BROADER HOMELESSNESS POPULATION SOMEWHERE BETWEEN EXPERIENCING ALMOST HALF OF YOUR MENTAL ILLNESS. THIS IS A RELATIVELY SMALL BUT A COUPON PORTION OF THE BROADER POPULATION WHILE PROJECT ROOM HE ASKED HOUSE MORE INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE DURING THE PANDEMIC.
