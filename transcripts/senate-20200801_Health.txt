ITEM NUMBER TWO EIGHTY NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX. GOOD MORNING SENATORS SAID MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE TODAY- I THINK IT'S ALL GONNA GO SMOOTHLY AS I'M DRIVING DOWN AND ALL THE LIGHTS TURN GREEN ALL THE WAY DOWN SO I TAKE THAT AS A GOOD SIGN FOR ALL OF US HERE TODAY. AT TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WHICH UPDATES AND EXPAND SOME ASPECTS OF LAURA'S LAW WENT HOME AGAIN WANT TO START BY THANKING THE CHAIR FOR HEARING THIS BILL TODAY AND ALSO GLADLY ACCEPTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AMENDMENT TO AT THE DELAY IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. THIS IS THE SECOND BILL I INTRODUCED THIS YEAR AS PART OF MY MENTAL HEALTH PACKAGE WELL BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE ALREADY HAD A PANDEMIC ON OUR STREETS. DEALING WITH HOMELESSNESS AND MENTAL HEALTH. AND THIS IS ONE STEP OF MY THAT MAKING MY QUESTION ALL OF OUR QUEST TO TRY TO ADDRESS THIS. ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT OR LAURA'S LAW IT'S AN EVIDENCE BASED COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES TREATMENTS. TO THOSE WHO OTHERWISE MAY BE UNABLE TO ACCESS COMMITTEE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES VOLUNTARILY. DUE TO THEIR SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THIS BILL WOULD EXPAND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF. ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT STATEWIDE WHILE STILL PROVIDING LOCAL CONTROL THROUGH THE FLEXIBILITY. TO ALLOW COUNTIES TO OPT OUT BY LOCAL BOARDS. AND THIS WILL ALSO ALLOW COUNTY THAT MIGHT BE SMALLER TO COLLABORATE WITH EACH OTHER- AS THEY AS THEY MOVE TOWARDS IMPLEMENTATION. AS WELL AS REPEALING THE SUNSET DATE. AFTER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF THIS BEING IMPLEMENTED WE FEEL LIKE IT IS AND AGAIN EVIDENCE BASED HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE EIGHTEEN YEARS. AND WHILE WE'RE REMOVING A SUNSET DATE. DISTILLING TO BE REPORT DONE TO THE STATE EVERY SINGLE YEAR. NONE OF US ARE STRAIN TO THE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT ARE IN OUR STATE IN OUR COUNTRY THAT PLAGUE OUR STREETS AND THE FAMILIES THAT WE KNOW ARE BEHIND EVERY PERSON. THAT WE SEE OUT THERE. THIS WEEK THE STATE AUDITOR RELEASED A- AUDIT ON LPS THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN ANTICIPATING FOR MONTHS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT SOONER BUT WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL THAT IT. IS ARRIVE ANNA AND I AND IT HAS GO EVEN FOR THAN THIS BILL DOES AND I AM CERTAINLY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT. BUT WE HAVE THIS BILL IN FRONT OF US TODAY AND AS YOU ALL KNOW WHEN WE GET TO TE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS OF REVIEWING AND BOUGHT IT THAT MAY TAKE MONTHS HERE'S- A TIME RIGHT NOW WE HAVE SOMETHING IN FRONT OF US THAT WILL ACT AS ONE MORE TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX. DO I THINK ASSISTED APERTURE TREATMENT SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED STATEWIDE YES I DO BUT THIS PROVIDES A FIRST STEP THAT CONTINUES TO WRITE LOCAL CONTROL. TO COUNTIES- IF WE DECIDE TO HAVE MORE CHANGES LATER WE CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT. THIS BILL ALSO. MAKE SURE THAT NO FUNDS THAT ARE CURRENTLY USE FOR OTHER PROGRAMS ARE DEFERRED TO BE ABLE TO USE FOR THIS. ESPECIALLY THOSE DEALING WITH CHILDREN. THAT EXPANDING LOWERS LAW WOULD HOPEFULLY MEET EARLIER INTERVENTION. AS WE KNOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY GET TO THE POINT WHERE THEY HAVE TO BE HELD AGAINST THEIR WILL IT IS REACHED A CRISIS POINT WE KNOW THE COST OF PEOPLE CIRCLING IN AND OUT OF OUR EMERGENCY ROOMS IN OUR JAILS BEHIND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES WE KNOW THIS IS AN EFFECTIVE IMPLEMENTATION- THEN WE KNOW THAT. POTENTIALLY LOWER WILCOX WITH HIS BILL IS NAMED AFTER WOULD STILL BE ALIVE WITH US TODAY IF THIS TREATMENT HAD BEEN IN PLACE- AGAIN THIS IS A ROBUST PROGRAM EVERY MEMBER HERE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THAT DOCTOR PAN AND THE VICE CHAIR ALREADY HAVE THIS PROGRAM IN THEIR COUNTIES- IMAGINE I'M SURE YOU STILL SEE THE PROBLEMS ON YOUR STREETS IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD BE IF THEY DIDN'T HAVE THIS THIS TOOL AS WELL- WE STILL HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO.

GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM RANDALL PICKER- I DO REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHE ASSOCIATION THE SPONSORS OF THIS JUST REAL QUICKLY TO KIND OF REMIND US ABOUT WHAT ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT IS A PROGRAM THAT'S BASICALLY COURT SUPERVISED INTENSIVE TREATMENT IT'S MEANT FOR A SMALL GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS. WHO TYPICALLY LACK INSIGHT- BAY MAY RECESSES BECAUSE OF THAT A REFUSE OR BE ABLE BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO SICK TO ACTUALLY COMPLY WITH TREATMENT BECAUSE OF THAT- IT'S NOT SURPRISING THEY GET ARRESTED THEY HAVE HOSPITALIZATIONS THEY MAY NEED HE ALSO ENGAGE IN A PRESS FOR ACTS OF VIOLENCE AND THIS IS A REVOLVING DOOR PATTERN FOR THEM BASED ON RESEARCH THIS KIND OF PROGRAM SHOWS YOU CAN GET VERY GOOD OUTCOMES UNDER TWO CONDITIONS. ONE IS THAT IF YOU TREAT PEOPLE PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS THAT'S ONE UP FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS YOU CAN REDUCE HOSPITALIZATIONS WRAPS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE VIOLENCE- THEY ALSO RETAIN STABLE HOUSING IN AN ASSISTED OUTPATIENT PROGRAM I'M PROBABLY JUST AS IMPORTANT AS ANYTHING ELSE IF NOT MORE SO BEAR MEDICATION COMPLIANCE. IN THE PROGRAM THE STATUTE HAS SUBSTANTIAL PROCEDURAL DUE PROCESS- THESE INDIVIDUALS OFTEN FACE A CHOICE WHEN ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT IS AVAILABLE IT'S AN ALTERNATIVE TO JAIL POSSIBLY PRISON BUT CERTAINLY JAIL OR HOSPITALIZATION IT IS A COURT SUPERVISED PROGRAM IS A SAD- IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING ONCE YOU'RE DONE WITH THE COURT PROCESS YOU GET TO GO HOME AND SLEEP IN YOUR OWN BED AT NIGHT IT IS A COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAM. AND AS I SAID IT HAS- VERY REMARKABLE AND SOMETIMES DRAMATIC RESULTS FOR PEOPLE IT'S BEEN DEMONSTRATED FOR OVER EIGHTEEN YEARS IT IS DESERVING- STATEWIDE APPLICATION AND NOW WE HAVE A VERY POWERFUL- SENTIMENTS ON THE PART OF THE- AUDITOR. THAT THE SHOULD GHOST EVEN THOUGH NOT WHAT WE HAD SHE WITH THIS WE BELIEVE IT'S VERY CONSISTENT WITH THAT PART OF THE AUDITOR'S REPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- I UNDERSTAND MISTER WILCOX AND FOURTEEN IS NOT CALLED BACK BUT MODERATELY PLEASE CHECK AGAIN TO SEE IF MISTER WILLCOX IS AVAILABLE TO TESTIFY. YEAH I AM ON THE LINE THANK YOU WELCOME. PLEASE BEGIN. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH A GOOD AFTERNOON I HAD ORIGINALLY WRITTEN GOOD MORNING BUT IT IS AFTERNOON- MY NAME IS NICOLE COCCI I'M CALLING IN THIS MORNING AND I IN SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX- BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER HOW SUSAN EGGMAN- THIS STILL REMOTE THE SUNSET CLAUSE FROM LARS VON THE- COUNTIES. TO IMPLEMENT THE LAW UNLESS THEY AFFIRMATIVELY OPT OUT. MY WIFE AMANDA AND I BEEN AND IN THIS ISSUE SINCE TWO THOUSAND ONE. WHEN AB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WAS FIRST UNDER CONSIDERATION IN THAT YEAR. OUR DAUGHTER LAURA WAS A VICTIM IN A RAMPAGE SHOOTING PERPETRATED BY A MAN WITH SEVERE UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS. WE UNDERSTOOD EARLY THAT MANY WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS DO NOT RECOGNIZE OR ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR CONDITION THEREFORE DO NOT ENGAGE IN TREATMENT. LARGE LAW WAS AN ATTEMPT TO CREATE A LEGAL STRUCTURE AND A TREATMENT PROGRAM TO ENGAGE SUCH INDIVIDUALS. WE ENCOUNTER STRONG OPPOSITION AT THAT TIME IN ORDER TO MOVE THE ISSUE FORWARD ASSEMBLY MEMBER HELEN THOMPSON. ORIGINAL AUTHOR OF THE FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE AGREED TO A FIVE YEAR SUNSET CLAUSE IN TWO THOUSAND TWO. WHEN OUR OWN COUNTY- WHICH IS NEVADA COUNTY WAS THE FIRST TO FULLY IMPLEMENT LARGE LAW IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT SINCE THEN MANY COUNTY SO FOLLOWED SUIT NOW OVER HALF OF. BUT IT CAN COUNTIES THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE LAW. THE LEGISLATURE HAS EXTENDED THE SUNSET ON THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS SINCE THAT TIME. THE DIRE CONSEQUENCES OF THE LOG THEIR OPPONENT'S PREDICTED AT THE OUTSET HAVE NOT MATERIALIZED. IN OUR COUNTY THE OUTCOMES HAVE BEEN BETTER THAN WE HAD EVER ENVISIONED THE PRODUCTIONS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS INCARCERATION AND HOMELESS. THE COURT ORDER ITSELF HAS NOT BEEN UTILIZED AS FREQUENTLY AS WE HAD EXPECTED MISTER. FANTASTIC ARTICLE SHORTLY. HAS THAT. IS IT IN OVER 50% OF CASES CORRIDORS ARE ARE UNNECESSARY AND PEOPLE ENGAGING TREATMENT VOLUNTARILY AFTER INTERACTION WITH THE JUDGE. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE HAD HOPED FOR AFTER ALL THE GOAL OF MOORE'S LAW IS NOT TO BE PUNITIVE BUT TO ENGAGE PEOPLE AND LONG TERM TREATMENT SO THAT THEY MAY START ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY. WE BELIEVE THAT LEARNING LONG HAS NOW PROVEN AND THE TIME IS COME TO MAKE IT PERMANENT AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO YOU CAN MORE CALIFORNIANS. PROVIDING QUALITY MENTAL HEALTH CARE IS THE HUMANE THING TO DO A CUTS AND EASIER AT BEST INTEREST TO SIGN. ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS OVER THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS PEOPLE HAVE APPROACHED AMANDA NINE INSTRUMENT CUTS AND THEN ASKING DENTAL RECORDS PLEASE.

EIGHT THANK YOU HONORABLE MEMBERS I'M ELLIE OKAY APPLE THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION THE LPS AUDIT REFERENCE PREVIOUSLY LOOKED AT INVOLUNTARY SERVICES ARE OPPOSITION AB NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX IS REALLY BASED ON CONCERNS RELATED TO THE IMPACT THE BILL'S GOING TO HAVE A VOLUNTARY COMMUNITY BASED HEALTH SERVICES UNDER THEM FRONT IN THE QUIRK AND THEY'LL ACT THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM WAS CREATED TO ENSURE VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS HAVE ACTED THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE. CLIENT CENTERED SERVICES THAT PROMOTE SELF DETERMINATION AND PERSONAL RIGHT THESE VALUES OF THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE REFLECTED IN THE EXISTING AIR Q. ROLE WHICH HOLD THAT THIS COURSE OF SERVICE A COUNTY OPTION ADOPTED ONLY AFTER A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE IMPACT ADOPTING THIS PROGRAM CURRENTLY REQUIRES A COUNTY HIS BELLY WITH THE IMPACT ON VOLUNTARY SERVICES FOR ADULTS AND ANY SERVICES FOR CHILDREN ONLY AFTER A COUNTY DEMONSTRATE NO ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SERVICES. KENNY COUNTY INTO PROVIDING A KEY AB NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX IN THIS PROCESS AND WOULD ALLOW IN OUR COULD WE'RE CONCERNED THAT IT WOULD ALLOW HIM POLITICAL DYNAMICS IT TAKE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FIRST OF THE AFOREMENTIONED COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION ADDITIONALLY UNDER THE CURRENT BUDGET KLEIN NETWORK COMPANIES ARE EXPECTED TO SEE A ONE BILLION DOLLAR DROP IN REVENUE THAT THE FADING REDUCTIONS IN SERVICES AND PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE WRONG KIND OF PRESSURE COUNTY IMPLEMENTED NEW PROGRAM OR EXPAND ON AN EXISTING ONE COUNTIES ARE ALREADY FEELING THE PRESSURE TO SERVE THE ADDITIONAL ONE POINT TWO MILLION NEW MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES WHILE OUR REVENUE SEARCHES ARE PLUMMETING RIGHT NOW THE UPTAKE OF AOKI IS WORKING IN A MANNER THAT IT NEEDS TO WORK IN A REPORT. THAT ENVIRONMENT AND UNFORTUNATELY AB THAT SEVENTY SIX NOTHING TO ADDRESS. THE REAL. SENDING A- WHICH IS THE LACK REPORT. BECAUSE OF THE KERN BUDGET. IN CONCERN WITH THE BIT THAT THIS MAKE. OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING. HE A STRONGLY URGES HEALTH COMMITTEE. NO ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK THANK YOU OF NEXT WHAT THE STATUS OF IS MISTER CHILD. GOOD AFTERNOON DOCTOR BILLION AND MEMBERS OF- OF THE COMMITTEE WE AGREE WITH AND CHILLING IN THE TESTIMONY OF OUR COLLEAGUE FROM OTHER COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WE HAD INITIALLY HAS AN OPPOSING COMMANDED POSITION ON BILL FIRST WE BELIEVE THAT IN THE EVENT THAT. A MULTI COUNTY PROGRAMS THAT WOULD NOW BE AUTHORIZED SERVICES SHOULD BE PROVIDED WHERE THE RECIPIENT RESIDES OR IN THE IN AN AREA READILY ACCESSIBLE TO THE SERVICES AND THAT THE BILL WOULD NEED TO REFLECT THAT- SECOND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL HASN'T BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE NATURE OF THE PROGRAM FROM- FROM BEING AN OPTIONAL TO A MANDATORY PROGRAM. AND BY ALLOWING THE MULTI COUNTY ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICE DELIVERY SO WE THINK IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE- TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A SUNSET REMAIN IN THE ACT SO THAT THE IMPACT OF THIS REVISED PROGRAM CAN BE EVALUATED UNDER THAT NEW STRUCTURE AND BE SUBJECT TO FURTHER EVALUATION. HOWEVER WITH THE RELEASE OF THE STATE AUDITOR'S AUDIT OF THE LPS SYSTEM THIS WEEK WE'RE NOW OPPOSED TO THE BILL- THE AUDITOR'S FINDING MADE CLEAR THAT THE STATE SHOULD NOT BE MAKING IT EASIER TO FORCE MENTALLY ILL. CALIFORNIANS IN THE TREATMENT RATHER SHOULD BE OUR BALL TREATMENT AND THE DELAY OF SIR. THE AUDITOR'S SOME IN WHERE THAT IVOLUNTARY- TREAT WHICH SHOULD NOT BE EXPANDED AND SHE ANALYZE VIDEO TV- WITHIN THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS SO WE BELIEVE THAT THE OTHERS- RECOMMENDATIONS- DESERVE SOME CAREFUL EVALUATION WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE ENTIRE MENTAL HEALTH LITTLE EVERY SYSTEM ND WE SHOULD IMPLEMENT A SINGLE PIECE SUCH AS THIS BILL. WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE IMPACTS OF THE MULTIPLE CARDS ON THE SYSTEM PARTICULARLY WHEN IT CONCERNS COLOR SLEEP INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT LIKE THIS BILL- DOES. AS THE COMEDIAN NOW I WAS IS PROPERLY NO FOR THE COMMITTEE SHOULD TAKE A LOOK WHETHER IT IS INDEED PREMATURE WE BELIEVE THAT IF THEY AND AGAIN THAT THE- YEAH. EGGMAN VERY ARE OF THE OF THE AUDITOR'S PEOPLE THAT IT LOOKS POLICE. AN AS LIKELY TO NOTED IN THE TO COMMITTEE SCORE OF THE- WE CIVIL RIGHTS ARE. IMPLICATED AS THEY ARE IN THIS BILL THAT'S WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL WOULD THREATEN THE DELIVERY OF SERVICE USING THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT. AND SHOULD BE FULLY THAT AND CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE AUDITOR'S REPORT SO FOR THESE REASONS WE SPECIFICALLY OPPOSE THE BILL AND- OKAY THANK YOU. WE ARE NOW- HEAR FROM- OPPOSITION.

AND WE'RE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY. THE OVERARCHING CONCERN WE HAVE AND THE REASON FOR THE OPPOSITION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION AND CREATION OF THE TELEHEALTH PROGRAM THAT OUTLINED THE NAVY TWENTY THREE SIXTY. IT NATIONALLY TO HAVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION AND CREATION IN THOSE COSTS ARE GOING TO BE PASSED ON. TO THE INSURED THE PARTICIPANTS THE HEALTH PLAN. THE CALIFORNIA. WHICH MEANS INCREASE CREAMY FOR EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES IN THAT STATE SO. MOST OF YOU HAVE LIKELY SEEN THE COVER CALIFORNIA REPORT THE RECENTLY CAME OUT WHERE THEY ANTICIPATE. PREMIUMS ARE GOING TO RUN INTO TWENTY ONE ANYWHERE FROM 4240% BECAUSE OF THE UNANTICIPATED COBERLY ACOSTA FROM THIS YEAR. AND SO IF WE'RE LOOKING AT A LANDSCAPE WHERE PREMIUMS ARE POTENTIALLY INCREASING UP 240% NEXT YEAR WE'RE GONNA BE LAYERING. MORE COST ON TOP OF THAT IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT THAT MUCH MORE AND MANAGE UNMANAGEABLE PARTICULARLY THAT WERE PURCHASED IN THE HEALTH PLAN SO. I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND- THE RELEVANT TO TIME IN THE BILL IT IS A GREAT IDEA TO DISCUSS AT THIS POINT HI AND- WE'RE LOOKING AT MEDICINE FROM A DISTANCE BUT- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE WHOLE PICTURE. NOW MAY NOT BE THE BEST TIME TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING LIKE THIS. CONSIDERING STRUGGLING INDIVIDUALS BUSINESSES SMALL BENEATH THE EMPLOYEES EMPLOYERS.

SEVENTY SIX- WELL WE UNDERSTAND AT THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS FUNDAMENTALLY ALTERED NEARLY EVERY FACET OF EVERYDAY LIFE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS.

LASTLY I. ME Q. THE- THEY ARE CONCERNED. ABOUT THE KING OF THE IMPACT. OF BENEFIT MANDATE SOME PREMIUM. PARTICULARLY AS WE FACE THE INHERENT PRESSURES ON THE BALL AND THEY WILL MARKET. BECAUSE THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS ONLY ELEVATED HOW CRITICAL IT IS TO MAINTAIN AFFORDABLE PREMIUM AND NOT A NECESSARILY DRIVE. UP THE COST OF CARE.
