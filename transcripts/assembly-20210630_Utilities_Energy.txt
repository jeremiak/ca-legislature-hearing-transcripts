A BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION AND ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING SENATOR BAKER WELCOME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CARE MEMBERS. THIS BILL IS ABOUT REDUCING THE BARRIERS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO HELP US ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE GOALS. UNFORTUNATE WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO SWITCH TO ELECTRIC HEATING OR INSTALL VEHICLE CHARGERS OR ENERGY STORAGE EQUIPMENT GOVERNMENT FACE HIGH COSTS AND LONG DELAYS. WE NEED PEOPLE TO BE MAKING THESE CHANGES SO WE SHOULD MAKE IT A LOT EASIER FOR THEM. TO DO SO. HI THIS BILL ATTACKS THE BERRIES BY PROVIDING BETTER INFORMATION. AND SUPPORTING R&amp;D EFFORTS FOR TECHNOLOGY MAKE THIS CHEAPER AND EASIER. FIRST IN INFORMATION CONTRACTORS OFTEN HAVE LITTLE EXPERIENCE WITH ELECTRIC HEATING AND NEW DEVICES. PEOPLE IN THE BEING TALKED OUT OF ELECTRIFYING BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT OR THEY END UP DOING COSTLY PANEL UPGRADES. THAT COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. LOCAL BUILDING DEPARTMENTS ALSO MAKE IT UNNECESSARILY EXPENSIVE. SO THIS BILL DIRECTS ENERGY COMMISSION TO GATHER AND PUBLISH BEST PRACTICES. TO HELP GET BETTER INFORMATION OUT THERE SO BUILDING OWNERS THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN DO THIS MORE. EFFICIENTLY A SECOND TECHNOLOGY WE NEED TO DRIVE DOWN THE COST OF ELECTRIFICATION- SOME TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN AVOID THE NEED TO ACTUALLY FOR PANEL UPGRADES. AND MAKE IT FASTER AND EASIER TO HAVE HANDLES UPGRADES IF NEEDED. BUT IT'S RELATIVELY NEW AND NOT WIDELY DEPLOYED AND IT'S AN AREA WHERE ARE DEFINING COULD HELP. THIS BUILDING ADDS TECHNOLOGY TO. REDUCE THE COST OF BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION TO LIST OF CHALLENGES THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED FOR AFFECT FUNDING. COMBINED WE BELIEVE BETTER INFORMATION BETTER TECHNOLOGY WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR OWNERS TO LECTURE FIVE- ENERGY USE IN BUILDINGS AND PROVIDE CHARGES FOR THE VEHICLES SUPPORTING OUR STATE GOALS. AT TO SUPPORT US HERE TODAY WE HAVE TO WIN ESTES HERE TO FORGE FROM ENERGY C. AND CHEN PEPPER THE CO PENCIL CLEAN ENERGY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MODERATOR WILL TURN TO CHEN PEPPER WITH PENINSULA CLEAN ENERGY YOU WILL PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. IF YOU'RE ON THE LINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN. OKAY CAN YOU HEAR ME RIKA. OKAY GREAT THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR HOLDEN AND HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM JAN PEPPER CEO OF PENINSULA CLEAN ENERGY AND WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT SB SIXTY EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THESE COMMENTS TODAY. BUT IN FOR A CLEAN ENERGY IS A JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY OF TWENTY TWO CITIES TOWNS AND THE COUNTY RUNNING A COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATOR PROGRAM SERVING ROUGHLY. SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS AND SALMON TAIL COUNTY AND EXPANDING TO LOS BANOS AND WE'RE SAID COUNTY IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. WE ARE NOT FOR PROFIT AGENCY AND PROVIDE TO ALL OF OUR CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION WE DEVELOP AND ADMINISTER LOCAL PROGRAMS TO FURTHER REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY EXPANDING EXPANDING BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION AND ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING FOR ALL OF SAN MATTEO COUNTIES RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES. WE FUND THESE PROGRAMS BY REINVESTING OUR REVENUES INTO ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY. OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SUPPORTED OUR MEMBER CITIES TO ADOPT LOCAL REACH CODES FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION TO TRANSITION FROM NATURAL GAS TO CLEAN ELECTRICITY. FOR SPACE AND WATER HEATING AND PROVIDE FOR EASY CHARGERS. SO FAR- LEVIN OVER TWENTY ONE MEMBER AGENCIES IN THE COUNTY HAVE ADOPTED THESE REACH CODES WHICH REPRESENT A QUARTER OF THE STATE'S TOTAL WITH MORE IN PROGRESS. YOUR THIS WORK WE HAVE IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS BARRIERS INCLUDING THE NEED FOR MORE EDUCATION AMONG PRACTITIONERS AND THE CHALLENGE OF LONG TIME LINES FOR UTILITY SERVICE WORK. SOME CITIES HAVE DELAYED ADOPTING REACH CODES BECAUSE OF CONCERNS FROM RESIDENTS ABOUT DELAYS. OF THREE TO EIGHT MONTHS FOR PG&amp;E TO RESPOND TO INCOMPLETE ROUTINE SERVICE UPGRADE REQUEST. SB SIXTY EIGHT WILL HELP US DO MORE THE BILL WILL HAVE THE CDC AND OTHER STATE AGENCIES PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND BEST PRACTICES. THIS BILL WILL FIND MORE WORK TO BRING INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO THE MARKET FASTER AND THIS BILL WILL HELP BUILDING OWNERS GET UPGRADES AND FASTER AND AT LESS COST. WE WANT TO WORK WITH THE STATE TO REDUCE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF OUR BUILDING AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT SB SIXTY EIGHT AND WANT TO THANK SENATOR BECKER. AUTHORING THIS IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT AND SB SIXTY EIGHT. THANK YOU THANK YOU OUR NEXT WITNESSES PIERRE DAHLE FORGE WITHIN OUR DC YOU MAY PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU TO HOLDEN AND ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY. MIAMI GATHER FOR SOME OF THE FACTORS WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL OR NRDC. TESTIFYING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB SIXTY EIGHT. THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD IN CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP IN ADDRESSING THE CLIMATE AND AIR POLLUTION EMITTED BY ITS BUILDINGS AND TRANSPORTATION. ELECTRIFICATION OF HEATING EQUIPMENT AND CALL IT A KEY STRATEGY FOR THE COMPANY I THINK CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY CANNOT AFFORDABLE MANNER. AND FOR REDUCING THAT POLLUTION IN UPSTATE. HOWEVER ONE OF THE KEY CHALLENGES FACING HOMEOWNERS WHO WANT TO ELECTRIFY THE BUILDINGS AND VEHICLES AND THE BUILDING PROFESSIONALS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO SUPPORT THEM. IF THE LACK OF CLEAR AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE INFORMATION ABOUT COST EFFECTIVE ELECTRIFICATION STRATEGIES. PARTICULARLY ON HOW TO AVOID COSTLY ELECTRIC PANEL UPGRADE. WHICH ARE A MAJOR COST FACTOR. THEY ALSO NEED TO TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION TO BETTER MANAGE GROWING ELECTRIC LOADS WITHOUT INFLICTING GREAT COST. THIS BILL IDENTIFIED AND REDUCES BARRIERS TO HOMEOWNERS WHO WANT TO TRANSITION TO USING CLEAN ELECTRICITY TO HEAT THEIR HOMES AND SHOT THAT CAUGHT. DEVELOPING AN MAKING ACCESSIBLE GUIDANCE AND BEST PRACTICES TO BETTER ENABLE CALIFORNIANS TO OVERCOME THESE BARRIERS. IF THE VITAL TO MAKING PROGRESS ON REDUCING EMISSIONS AND ALL STATE. DIRECTING RESEARCH FUNDS TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WOULD LOWER THE COST OF THE TRANSITION TO CLEAN ENERGY IN BUILDINGS AND VEHICLES FOR EVERYONE. THE BILL MAKES PROGRESS FUNDED ISSUES BY BETTER UTILIZING AND MAKING ACCEPTABLE EXISTING FUNDING AND EXPERTISE. THEREFORE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I THOUGHT THANK YOU.

I WILL NOW TURN TO ITEM THREE SB- TO TWENTY TWO DODD WATER RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. SENATOR THAT YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS. SB BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENT ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS. MEMBERS SB TWO TWO TWO WOULD ESTABLISH THE WATER RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM TO HELP PROVIDE ASSISTANCE FOR BOTH DRINKING AND WASTEWATER SERVICES TO LOW INCOME RATEPAYERS EXPERIENCING ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS. SOME OF YOU MAY RECALL IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN I AUTHORED LEGISLATION AB FOUR OH ONE ASKED THE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD TO STUDY THE ISSUE OF A LOW INCOME WATER RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM OR WATER ZERO. THE BOARD IS DONE THAT IN SB TWO TWO TWO TAKES THE NEXT STEP OF MOVING FORWARD TO ENACT SUCH A PROGRAM. IN ADDITION TO COMPLETING THE WATER LIVER STUDY THE WATER BOARD RECENTLY SURVEYED HUNDREDS OF COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS AROUND THE STATE TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH WATER DEBT. WATER GET WATER SYSTEM CUSTOMERS WERE CREWING. AND THE RESULTS WERE VERY WELL. FRANKLY INCREDIBLY SOBERING. EXAMPLES OF HOW SERIOUS THE PROBLEM OF WATER UNAFFORDABILITY HAS ACTUALLY BECOME. OVER ONE AND A HALF MILLION HOUSEHOLDS ARE BEHIND ON THEIR WATER BILLS THAT'S OVER FIVE MILLION PEOPLE STRUGGLING TO PAY FOR CLEAN SAFE DRINKING AND WASTEWATER. HAVE A DEBT OF AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND OF THESE HOUSEHOLDS HAVE DEBT GREATER THAN A THOUSAND DOLLARS. Q. MINIMALLY CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCRUED ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF WATER DEBT AND THAT NUMBER IS INCREASING ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN PRE PANDEMIC OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS HAD ALREADY LOST THEIR WATER SERVICE DUE TO THE INABILITY TO PAY WATER BILLS. THE NUMBER HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED DURING THIS PANDEMIC. GROWING WATER DEBT IS ALSO A PROBLEM FOR WATER SYSTEMS SOME WATER SYSTEMS OF WATCHED AS MUCH AS THAN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS ARE FACING FINANCIAL COLLAPSE DUE TO THE INABILITY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS TO PAY WATER BILLS. CALIFORNIA HAS A LOW INCOME RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS UTILITIES. IN NOT WITHSTANDING STATE POLICY THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. THERE IS NO COMPARABLE WATER RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR PUBLICLY OWNED AND COMMUNITY OWNED WATER SYSTEMS. IT'S ABOUT TIME WE HAVE A STATE WIDE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WHO STRUGGLE TO PAY FOR DRINKING AND WASTEWATER. SB TWO TWO TWO IS NARROWING ITS FOCUS ON DIRECT WATER RESISTANCE. WATER CRISIS ASSISTANCE AND RENTER'S CREDIT. THE BILL REQUIRES THE COMMUNITY SERVICES DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP AN EXPENDITURE PLAN THAT WOULD IDENTIFY THE FUNDING THE FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. WELL I'M GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR- BEFORE HE PROPOSED A ONE BILLION DOLLARS WATER DEBT RELIEF THE TRUTH IS THE PROBLEM WATER AFFORDABILITY FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WILL PERSIST. THIS BILL DOES NOT IDENTIFY A FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE RESISTANCE PROGRAM THAT IS A PARALLEL CONVERSATIONS BEGINNING TO TAKE PLACE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES ON THE PHONE WHO ARE READY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IT AT THE PROPER TIME MISTER GERALD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THIS CRITICALLY NEEDED PROGRAM. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD WILL TURN TO OUR TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. I WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES- MODERATOR IF YOU CAN RECOGNIZE JENNIFER CLARY OF CLEAN WATER ACTION YOU MAY PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR HOLDEN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JENNIFER CLARY AND I'M THE CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR FOR CLEAN WATER ACTION OUR ORGANIZATION IS A SPONSOR CONNECT UP TO TWENTY TWO I AM ALSO SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF MY FELLOW SPONSORING ORGANIZATION. COMMUNITY WATER CENTER IN LEADERSHIP COUNSEL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN ARMS ARE GOING TO PATIENTS STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL BUT YOU FINALLY PUT INTO PLACE A FRAMEWORK FOR COMPREHENSIVE STATEWIDE LOW INCOME WATER MADE% ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE OUR YEARS ADVOCATING FOR SAFE DRINKING WATER HAVE TARGETED MAKING WATER SAFE IS ONLY HALF THE BATTLE IT HOUSEHOLDS COMMUNITY CAN'T AFFORD THE WATER FROM THEIR TAPS THE WATER IS STILL NOT ACCEPTABLE. THE WATERGATE CRISIS GENERATED BY THE PANDEMIC ALSO HIGHLIGHTED A LONG STANDING PROBLEM THE SAFETY NET THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED FOR OTHER UTILITIES ARE VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT FOR THOSE STRUGGLING TO PAY THEIR WATER BILLS. FOR INSTANCE ONLY ABOUT HALF OF THE STATE'S POPULATION IT SERVED BY PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM THAT EVEN OFFERS A LOW INCOME RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND THOSE PROGRAMS HAVE LIMITED ENROLLMENT. LARGELY BECAUSE THE COUNTRY TEAM REQUIREMENTS THE RESULT IS THAT FEW ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS ACTUALLY BEAT THE SYSTEM. OUR WATER BILL. IN EXCEPTION. THE COMMISSION TO THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO PUNCTUATE CHANGE AND THREE THEY ALSO REGULARLY SHARE ELIGIBILITY DATA WITH INVESTOR OWNED ENERGY UTILITY IT. IS LONG STANDING AFFORDABILITY PROGRAM AND ROLE MORE THAN 80% OF ELIGIBLE HOSPITALS. WATER PHILIP APPLICABILITY AS AN ISSUE IN EVERY PART OF THE STATE MALRAUX COMMUNITIES SUBURBS URBAN CENTERS. STATE ACTION IS NEEDED TO BRIDGES AFFORDABILITY GAP SENATE BILL G. TWENTY TO CREATE A POT FULL AND TRANSPARENT FRAMEWORK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STATEWIDE PROGRAM. THANK.

NEVER REDUCE OF THE COUNTY WE KNOW FROM TOO MANY ORGANIZATIONS STEPPED OUT TO THE PEOPLE OUR CUSTOMERS ARE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS. DO NOT HAVE REPAIRS IN PROGRAMS AT ANY TIME. FINALLY THRIVENT ARE BEING EXTREMELY HIGH RATE FOR THE WATER AS WELL AS THE SCENE WATER QUALITY ISSUES EXISTING PROGRAMS LIKE WHY HE- ARE NOT ABLE TO DRIVE RESIDENCE WATER THAT. WE'RE GRATEFUL TO OUR ALEX YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR YEARS AND FOR THE LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR DODD. AND THE BILL'S CO OPERATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WE- ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK FOR YOUR TESTIMONY WE HAVE NOW TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION TO TESTIFYING BY PHONE PHONE MODERATOR IF YOU CAN ALERT CINDY TALK WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES YOU MAY. PROCEED WITH HER TESTIMONY. THANK YOU TERRY HOLDEN IN MEMBERS CINDY TECH WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON SB TWO TWO TWO. WE AGREE WITH SENATOR DODD THAT THERE SHOULD BE A WATER LOW INCOME WATER RATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA. THE JUNE SEVENTEENTH VERSION OF THE BILL ADDRESSED ANOTHER ISSUE THAT WE HAVE RAISED AND WE APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR DODD HAS BEEN MAKING AMENDMENTS. TO MAKE THE BILL MORE WORKABLE. I'D LIKE TO RAISE TWO ISSUES TODAY THE FIRST IS IN SECTION ONE ONE SIX NINE THREE ONE POINT ONE- SEE THAT'S ON PAGE SIX. THIS PROVISION WOULD HAVE THE FUND EXPENDITURE PLAN IDENTIFIED THE FUNDING NEEDS OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS EVIDENTLY ACROSS THE STATE IT'S UNCLEAR EXACTLY WHAT THIS PROVISION WOULD BE USED FOR OVER HOW WE OPERATE. WE THINK THERE IS A MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO DETERMINE WHAT THE SUBSIDY UNDER THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE WE HAD A MEETING WITH THE DOCTOR STAFF AND SPONSORS LAST- GET THE END OF LAST WEEK. AND THEY ARE WILLING TO WORK ON THAT ISSUE SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO TRYING TO GET THAT ISSUE WORKED OUT THANK YOU FOR THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. THE SECOND ISSUE IS- REGARDING SECTION ONE ONE SIX NINE THREE ONE POINT ONE TWO. THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE- PROPOSAL WHERE THE P. YOU SEE WOULD DEVELOP A MECHANISM. FOR THE ELECTRIC AND GAS CORPORATIONS TO SHARE THEIR CUSTOMER DATA. AND WE APPRECIATE THAT- COMMITTEES WORK IN THE OFFICE WORK ON THE PRIVACY PART OF THAT. BUT- OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE THINK THE STATE ALREADY KNOWS INCOME LEVELS FOR HOUSEHOLD. SO IS THIS REALLY NEEDED IT THANK THE CONCERNED ABOUT CARE IS THAT THE ENROLLMENT ELIGIBILITY DOES NOT HAVE RIGOROUS VERIFICATION. SO THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY CORPORATE THERE SO WE SUGGEST DELETING THAT PROVISION OR LATER COVERS THE OTHER REMAINING ISSUES THAT WE HAVE. IN AGAIN WE APPRECIATE SENATOR DODD- YEAH AND THAT TEAM THAT HE HAS WORKING ON THIS- WORKING WITH THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. WILL TURN TO NIKOLINA FERNANDES WITH SEMPER. YOU MAY PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU CAN MEMBERS NICKEL AT THAT CENTER ENERGY AND THAT ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT HAVE A FORMAL LETTER OF OPPOSITION SUBMITTED WE DID RAISE THAT LIMITATION CONCERNS WITH THE AUTHORED MAINLY RELATED TO PRIVACY AND ALSO THE DEFINITION OF LOW INCOME LIKE THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED- THE BILL REQUIRES. ELECTRICAL OPERATIONS TO SHARE CUSTOMER ENROLLMENT DATA OUT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT. AND THE COMMITTEE'S ANALYSIS DISCUSSES THIS ISSUE IS THAT JACKSON SHOULD INFORMATION PRIVACY ACT WHICH WE DO NOT OBJECT TO IT BUT- IN ORDER TO PROTECT CUSTOMER CONFIDENTIALITY IT IS BEST PRACTICES TO CLARIFY WHAT TYPE OF DATA. IS BEING SHARED SECURELY SO. TEMPERATURES BUT- WHAT THE CUSTOMER HI INFORMATION IS THE DATA THAT'S BEING SHARED. AND THEN BECAUSE IT'S LIKELY THAT ARE CARE COVERAGE THEY RECEIVE OUTRAGE BY THE DEPARTMENT- ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS WE NEED PROTECTION FROM THAT DIRECT MARKETING ALSO KNOWN AS THE SUNSHINE ACT. WHILE I'M AT THE OTHER THAT RECOMMEND WONDER THANK- THE CARE CUSTOMER CONTACT INFORMATION THAT IS SHARED WITH pFOR PURPOSES THAT- THIRD PARTY DIRECT MARKETING UNDER CIVIL CODE SECTION ONE. SEVEN NINETY THREE POINT EIGHT THREE. AND I FOR THE LOW INCOME DEFINITION- AB FOR IMPLEMENTATION- CONSIDERATION. NOW WE DO NOT HAVE THEM- INFORMATION BASE ON A MEETING HOUSEHOLD- THE CARE ELIGIBLE IS BASED ON THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES SO AS THAT. OPERABLE COMMITTEE SHOULD THE- KIDDING FATHER WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE AT THE GYM I KNOW WHAT YOU REALLY NEED TO BE ATKINS. ALIGNED WITH BACK TO ENSURE WE COORDINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION. I JUST AS THE FINAL REMARK ON IT THINK THE OTHER STAFF- FOR THE BUBBLE CONSIDERATION WE DO SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL CUSTOMERS AND OTHER CUSTOMERS AB HARDSHIPS. AGAIN WE'RE NOT FORMALLY OPPOSED BUT YOU HOPE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE OTHER AND CAPTAIN JACK THESE TECHNICAL. AND OPERATIONAL ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

THE COMMITTEE'S HARD WORK ON THIS AND THE OTHER ITEMS THAT I THINK IS ON YOUR CAN SECOND COMMITTEE RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS YOU GUYS YOU ALL CAN LOOK- PAGE SEVEN PAGE NINE- DEFINING FIRM ZERO CARBON RESOURCES TO INCLUDE GEOTHERMAL REFLECTOR. ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN LONG DURATION ENERGY STORAGE A MULTI DAY ENERGY STORAGE- AND THEN TO STRIKE A FAIR BIT OF THIS LEGISLATION AND JUST TO BE CLEAR A FAIR BIT IS BEING TAKEN OUT HERE- AND THE REAL FOCUS IS GOING TO BE ON THIS C. E. C. ASSESSMENT SO. FOR THOSE OF YOU FOLLOWING ALONG IN THE IN THE DETAILS- IN SECTIONS TWO FIVE SIX AND SEVEN- THOSE ARE GOING TO BE STRUCK. AND SECTIONS AT WE'RE GONNA FOLD SECTIONS THREE AND FOUR INTO THE ASSESSMENT AND ESSENTIALLY THE GOAL HERE IS NOT TO- MAKE SOME- AND UNNECESSARY INTERVENTION INTO THE PUC'S I. R. P. PROCESS- OR TO PUT ANY THUMBS ON ON THAT SCALE- BUT TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT- THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION IS LOOKING AT. A VARIETY OF THESE FIRM ZERO CARBON. RESOURCES TO BRING BALANCE AND DIVERSITY TO OUR PORTFOLIO SO HOPEFULLY WHEN WE HAVE THESE EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS- VERY VERY HOT DAYS WE'RE EXPERIENCING NOW AND IN THE FUTURE IT HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON OUR SYSTEM AND- ALL KINDS OF VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AND HOW TO HAVE THAT BALANCE SYSTEM WILL STILL CHEATING ARE- ARE AGGRESSIVE RENEWABLES AND EMISSIONS GOALS I THINK IS THE GOAL OF THIS LEGISLATION WE DO NOT WANT TO. BUILD OUT THE FUTURE OF OUR POWER GRID TO BE LIKE TEXAS I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO LIVE. ON AN ISLAND IN CALIFORNIA WHERE- WE'RE RELYING SOLELY ON FOSSIL FUELS AND HOPING THAT'LL GET US THROUGH IT DIDN'T GET TEXAS THROUGH AND IN IN OUR STATE IT'S BEEN ACTUALLY A LOT OF THESE OTHER- STRONG NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT I'VE MENTIONED THAT.

PROCESS DID NOT INCLUDE A VALUATION OF A RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE THINK AND OTHERS THINK- NEED TO BE PART OF THAT THE DISCUSSION- BILLS INCLUDE MULTI DAY AND SEASONAL STORAGE. GEOTHERMAL OFFSHORE WIND. ON THE NEED FOR DIVERSITY AND BALANCE IN OUR PORTFOLIO WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE ENERGY COMMISSION ON THE SP ONE HUNDRED REPORT- AND SUGGESTIVE. BOTH THE NEED FOR A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO OF RENEWABLES AS WELL AS FIRM ZERO CARBON RESOURCES. THAT COULD HELP US BALANCE THE GRID AND THIS BALANCE AND DIVERSITY IS KEY ALONG WITH. INCLUDING ATTRIBUTES. THAT THE SYSTEM NEEDS AND ONE OBSERVATION WE HAVE FROM OUR EXPERIENCES THAT. NOT EVERY RESOURCE HAS TO HAVE ALL THE ATTRIBUTES THAT THE GRID NEEDS BUT THE- COMBINED PORTFOLIO. OF ATTRIBUTES HAS TO PRODUCE WHAT'S NEEDED AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO. TO BROADEN OUR THINKING A LITTLE BIT- OUR OUR ORIGINAL GOAL WAS TO INFLUENCE THE PLANNING PROCESS ON THE OTHER P. AND THE RESOURCE ADEQUACY BOTH OF WHICH NEED TO BE UP TO DATE. WITH THESE KINDS OF. TECHNOLOGIES BUT FOR THE MOMENT WE'RE LEFT WITH THIS ASSESSMENT OF THE CDC.

THAT- FOR TEN YEARS YOU KNOW THE CPC THE ENERGY COMMISSION. THEY THEY THEY THEY HAD TEN YEARS TO PLAN FOR THE- DECLARED A DEADLINE TO SHUT DOWN THE ONCE THROUGH COOLING NATURAL GAS POWER PLANTS- THE BASE THE STATE WATER BOARD ESTABLISHED THE POLICY IN NINETEEN TEN IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SHUT DOWN BY. THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY BUT WE WERE HIT WITH THESE- EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE A COMBINED WITH OF COURSE YOU KNOW ANOTHER SEASON OF A OF A TERRIFYING WILDFIRES. NOTED TO COME THIS YEAR AND SO.
