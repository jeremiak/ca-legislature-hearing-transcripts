00:23:18.296 --> 00:23:20.365
SELF STUDY WHICH MEANS WE NOW

HAVE A BRAND NEW NURSING

00:23:21.266 --> 00:23:23.502
PROGRAM- WHEN I STARTED AT THE

00:23:23.568 --> 00:23:25.771
BOARD IN TWENTY FIFTEEN WE HAD

00:23:25.837 --> 00:23:27.405

00:23:39.651 --> 00:23:41.253
IS A AN ARDUOUS. FOR BOTH THE

LIKE TO JUST. PROVIDE TO THAT

00:23:48.293 --> 00:23:50.529
WE ARE DOING THAT AND WE ARE

00:23:50.595 --> 00:23:52.898
SEEING IMPROVEMENT. THE BILL

00:24:03.341 --> 00:24:06.311
THAT'S STATEWIDE SO DO YOU HAVE

00:24:06.378 --> 00:24:07.746
YOU DO YOU HAVE THOSE NUMBERS

00:24:07.813 --> 00:24:11.883
BROKEN DOWN BY REGION. I DID

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:13.618
NOT COME PREPARED FOR THEM TO

00:24:13.685 --> 00:24:15.921
BE BROKEN DOWN BY REGION I

00:24:15.987 --> 00:24:17.222
CAN'T GET THAT INFORMATION TO

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:20.225
YOU- WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:21.993
OUT THOUGH THAT WHEN THEY ARE

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.830
PRESENTED. TO THE NURSING-

00:24:24.896 --> 00:24:27.132
BOARD THE BOARD MEMBERS DO

00:24:27.199 --> 00:24:29.267
RECEIVE REGIONAL DATA TO SEE

00:24:29.334 --> 00:24:30.669
WHETHER OR NOT THE WORKFORCE

00:24:30.735 --> 00:24:32.838
SUPPORTS THAT AND WHETHER THE

00:24:32.904 --> 00:24:34.372
CLINICAL PLACEMENT SUPPORT THAT

00:24:34.439 --> 00:24:35.540
AND THE BOARD MEMBERS MAKE

00:24:35.607 --> 00:24:36.575
THEIR DECISIONS BASED ON THE

00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:39.377
DATA THAT YOU PRESENTED SO-

00:24:39.444 --> 00:24:41.313
THERE WOULD BE A NEED IN THAT

00:24:41.379 --> 00:24:43.615
AREA WHERE THE SCHOOLS WERE

00:24:43.682 --> 00:24:45.984
APPROVED- AND THAT WOULD BE THE

00:24:46.051 --> 00:24:47.519
PROCESS THAT WE WOULD FOLLOW.

00:24:47.586 --> 00:24:48.553
THROUGH YEARS OF THAT I

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.488
UNDERSTAND THAT A MYERS MOVE

00:24:50.555 --> 00:24:52.224
INFORMATION IHAVE IS THAT THE

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:53.058
BEER AND HAS SHARED DATA THAT

00:24:53.124 --> 00:24:55.360
ANNUALLY THERE ARE AT LEAST

00:24:55.427 --> 00:24:55.961
TWENTY TWO THOUSAND QUALIFIED

00:24:56.027 --> 00:24:57.662
STUDENTS WERE UNABLE TO ENTER

00:24:57.729 --> 00:24:59.898
INTO PROGRAMS. BECAUSE THE BEER

00:24:59.965 --> 00:25:01.633
AND HAS CAPTAINED ROMANCE BUT

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.001
IN ALL IS ALSO CLAIMED THAT

00:25:03.068 --> 00:25:04.336
THERE IS NO SHOULD BE NO

00:25:04.402 --> 00:25:06.037
NURSING SHORTAGE IN MANY AREAS

00:25:06.104 --> 00:25:07.739
IS THAT STILL THE POSITION TO

00:25:07.806 --> 00:25:09.708
BE IRAN OR DO YOU ACKNOWLEDGE

00:25:09.774 --> 00:25:10.742
THAT THERE ARE SHORTAGES.

00:25:10.809 --> 00:25:12.677
GANKING CRITIC AND CRITICAL

00:25:12.744 --> 00:25:14.746
NEEDS IN AREAS OF THE STATE AND

00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:17.449
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE-

00:25:17.515 --> 00:25:22.654
EXPANDED PROGRAMS AND EXPENDED.

00:25:22.721 --> 00:25:23.255
BRIDGE PROGRAMS AND EXPANDED A

00:25:23.321 --> 00:25:24.589
ROMAN. THERE ARE CERTAIN. IN

00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:27.926
AREAS THAT- THERE IS SHORTAGE

00:25:27.993 --> 00:25:29.527
OF NURSES THAT IS ABSOLUTELY

00:25:29.594 --> 00:25:31.529
CORRECT IN DO YOU AGREE WITH

00:25:31.596 --> 00:25:32.364
THAT AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:35.267
WE HAVE SHARED. I DO WANT TO

00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:37.736
PASS THAT IN- I BELIEVE OUR

00:25:37.802 --> 00:25:40.238
FIRST AS SUNSET REPORT IT WAS

00:25:40.305 --> 00:25:44.809
SURE TO EIGHT NOW HAVE. ON LINE.

00:25:44.876 --> 00:25:47.412
SERVICES WE'RE AT THE DENTAL

00:25:47.479 --> 00:25:49.614
STUDENT CAN ACCESS AN ONLINE

00:25:49.681 --> 00:25:51.583
APPLICATION A SINGLE ONLINE

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:53.051
APPLICATION AND THEIR

00:25:53.118 --> 00:25:55.387
APPLICATION IS SENT OUT TO

00:25:55.453 --> 00:25:57.555
UPWARDS TO TWO HUNDRED NURSING

00:25:57.622 --> 00:26:00.392
SCHOOLS- FOR THAT STUDENT TO

00:26:00.458 --> 00:26:03.161
APPLY. SO I THINK WE NEED TO

00:26:03.228 --> 00:26:05.530
CLEAN THE DATA TO FIND OUT

00:26:05.597 --> 00:26:07.032
EXACTLY HOW MANY NURSING

00:26:07.098 --> 00:26:10.602
STUDENTS ARE INDIVIDUAL- UNIQUE

00:26:10.669 --> 00:26:12.938
REQUEST VERSUS MULTIPLE

00:26:13.004 --> 00:26:14.506
REQUESTS GOING OUT TO THE

00:26:14.572 --> 00:26:16.675
SCHOOLS- PRIOR TO THAT

00:26:16.741 --> 00:26:19.644
TECHNOLOGY IT WAS EASY TO SAY

00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:21.980
THIS PERSON WENT TO. THIS

00:26:22.047 --> 00:26:24.316
SCHOOL AND THIS WAS IN- NOW WE

00:26:24.382 --> 00:26:25.917
NEED TO LOOK AT IT FROM A MORE

00:26:25.984 --> 00:26:29.354
TECHNOLOGY GOAL EIGHT WHERE- WE

00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:31.323
MIGHT BE TRACKING BY VARIOUS

00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:33.191
IDENTIFIERS SO THAT WE CAN

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:35.193
PROVE THAT IT IS AN INDIVIDUAL

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.295
AND UNIQUE REQUEST VERSES ONE

00:26:37.362 --> 00:26:39.631
STUDENT BLANKING OUT TWO

00:26:39.698 --> 00:26:41.399
HUNDRED SCHOOLS. THE REQUESTED

00:26:41.466 --> 00:26:43.101
GIRL NOW THAT THERE'S THE

00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:45.270
TECHNOLOGY TO SPREAD OKAY WELL

00:26:45.337 --> 00:26:47.105
I WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IF

00:26:47.172 --> 00:26:48.974
YOU COULD SHARE THAT THE DATA

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.109

00:30:41.606 --> 00:30:43.775
WORK IN CALIFORNIA THAT THAT

00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:46.778
WOULD BEHOOVE YOU TO TRAVEL IN

00:30:46.844 --> 00:30:48.513
AND OUT- WHAT THAT DOESN'T

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.582
ANSWER IS WHEN THE NURSE MOVES.

00:30:50.648 --> 00:30:52.784
CALIFORNIA WHEN THEY MOVED TO

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:55.286
CALIFORNIA AND THEY TAKE UP

00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:57.622
RESIDENCE HERE THEY HAVE TO

00:30:57.689 --> 00:30:58.223
CHANGE THEIR PRIMARY STATE OF

00:30:58.289 --> 00:31:00.391
RESIDENCE. WHEN I PRIMARY STATE

00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:02.327
OF RESIDENCE IS CHANGE THAT'S

00:31:02.393 --> 00:31:04.295
DONE THE RAM DOOR SAME PROCESS.

00:31:04.362 --> 00:31:06.297
WHAT WE HAVE TO DO HERE IS FLOW

00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:11.369
THROUGH EVALUATION OF THEIR AT.

00:31:11.436 --> 00:31:13.137
TRANSCRIPTS TO ENSURE THAT THEY

00:31:13.204 --> 00:31:15.073
MEET OUR EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS.

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:16.241
RECEIVE THEIR FINGERPRINT

00:31:16.307 --> 00:31:17.442
RESPONSE BACK FROM THE

00:31:17.508 --> 00:31:20.345
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. WE ALSO

00:31:20.411 --> 00:31:22.347
NEED TO CHECK THEIR LICENSE

00:31:22.413 --> 00:31:23.648
VERIFICATION THROUGH NURSES

00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:25.216
WHICH WE ARE A MEMBER OF WE ARE

00:31:25.283 --> 00:31:27.018
A MEMBER OF NURSES AND WE DO

00:31:27.085 --> 00:31:27.752
GET OUR LICENSE VERIFICATION

00:31:27.819 --> 00:31:31.723
THROUGH THEM. AND THEN THEY WE-

00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:32.657
MAKE SURE THAT OUR CURRENT AN

00:31:32.724 --> 00:31:34.559
ACTIVE LICENSE AND ONCE THEY'VE

00:31:34.626 --> 00:31:36.894
MET ALL THAT WE ENDORSE IN THE

00:31:36.961 --> 00:31:38.863
CALIFORNIA. THE ONE THING THAT

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:40.598
WE ADDED DURING THIS PANDEMIC

00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:42.233
WHICH I THINK IS THAT BENEFIT

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.135
IS- WHEN WE REVIEW THE

00:31:44.202 --> 00:31:46.604
APPLICATION ONCE WE RECEIVE IT

00:31:46.671 --> 00:31:47.872
A BIGGER PRICE BACK WHICH IS

00:31:47.939 --> 00:31:49.307
TYPICALLY THE BIGGEST DELAY

00:31:49.374 --> 00:31:50.608
BECAUSE THAT IS A LENGTHY

00:31:50.675 --> 00:31:54.479
PROCESS TO ANOTHER AGENCY- IF

00:31:54.545 --> 00:31:56.147
THEY'RE- HAVING ISSUES MEETING

00:31:56.214 --> 00:31:57.615
OUR LICENSE REQUIREMENTS FOR

00:31:57.682 --> 00:31:59.717
EDUCATION. AND THEN A TEMPORARY

00:31:59.784 --> 00:32:01.919
LICENSE. TEMPORARY LICENSE IS

00:32:01.986 --> 00:32:03.788
GOOD FOR SIX MONTHS- THEY CAN

00:32:03.855 --> 00:32:05.256
USE THAT SIX MONTHS TO CLEAR UP

00:32:05.323 --> 00:32:07.358
ANY EDUCATIONAL DEFICIENCIES.

00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:08.359
AND THEN THEY HAVE THE ABILITY

00:32:08.426 --> 00:32:09.861
TO EXTEND THAT ADDITIONAL SIX

00:32:09.927 --> 00:32:11.696
MONTHS TO EQUAL ONE YEAR. IF

00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:14.098
THEY HAVE. CLASSES THAT NEED TO

00:32:14.165 --> 00:32:15.466
BE CLEARED UP SO THEY CAN BE

00:32:15.533 --> 00:32:17.168
LICENSE THEY CAN PRACTICE IN

00:32:17.235 --> 00:32:18.770

TEMPORARY LICENSE AND WE DO

00:32:20.805 --> 00:32:22.407
PROVIDE THAT TO THEM RIGHT NOW-

00:32:22.473 --> 00:32:25.076
WAIVER- WE- WITHOUT THEM HAVING

00:32:25.143 --> 00:32:26.611

ARE IN STATE SCHOOLS- WHEN

00:37:00.351 --> 00:37:01.686
LOOKING AT THE DATA COMPARISON

00:37:01.752 --> 00:37:03.854
FROM FROM OUT OF STATE TO IN

00:37:03.921 --> 00:37:05.790
STATE WOULD PROBABLY ABOUT

WE HAVE THAT PROCESS IN PLACE

00:37:58.409 --> 00:37:59.644

THAT IS STILL SOMETHING THAT WE

00:38:38.049 --> 00:38:40.685
WOULD HAVE TO. TAKE INTO

00:38:40.751 --> 00:38:41.318
CONSIDERATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL

00:38:41.385 --> 00:38:43.154
BASIS THE OTHER THING THAT

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:44.221
WOULD REQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL

00:38:44.288 --> 00:38:45.956
ARGUE IS IF THEY HAD

00:38:46.023 --> 00:38:48.626

00:38:48.693 --> 00:38:50.661

MAYBE NOT MAYBE PERCEPTION. BUT

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.435
HERE'S A SITUATION WE WATCHED

00:41:44.501 --> 00:41:46.637
ON TV WHERE NURSES ARE JUST

00:41:46.704 --> 00:41:48.706

IS IT TAKING SO LONG SO I'M

00:42:01.318 --> 00:42:03.153
PIGGY BACKING ON THAT. WHEN

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.722
SOMEONE GRADUATES FROM THE

00:42:04.788 --> 00:42:08.025
SCHOOL AND- IS GOOD PROCESSING

00:42:08.092 --> 00:42:09.660

TOLD IT TAKES UP TO SIX MONTHS

00:42:11.662 --> 00:42:13.430

00:42:13.497 --> 00:42:15.399
GRADUATING THEY GRADUATE RATHER

EMPLOYMENT AND HERE YOU GO SIX

00:42:18.469 --> 00:42:21.372

GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRACTICE-

00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:26.977
IN SO I HAVE TO EMPHASIZE THAT

00:42:27.044 --> 00:42:29.413
YOU MUST FIND A WAY TO EXPEDITE

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.549
THIS- OBVIOUSLY YOU MENTIONED

00:42:32.616 --> 00:42:33.684
THAT YOU'RE DOING A LITTLE BIT

00:42:33.751 --> 00:42:35.486
BETTER JOB. BUT WE'VE GOT TO DO

00:42:35.552 --> 00:42:37.354
SOMETHING IS IT JUST THAT

00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:39.123
TERRIBLE PERCEPTION THAT THE

00:42:39.189 --> 00:42:40.557
PUBLIC HAS THAT THERE ARE NOT

00:42:40.624 --> 00:42:42.526
ENOUGH NURSES WE HAD BRING

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:45.129
NURSES FROM OUTSIDE THE STATE-

00:42:45.195 --> 00:42:46.697
AND OF COURSE THE HOSPITALS HAD

00:42:46.764 --> 00:42:48.866
TO PAY MORE MONEY- FOR THEIR

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:50.167
TRAVEL THEIR STAY AND

00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:52.202
EVERYTHING ELSE WHEN WE HAVE A

00:42:52.269 --> 00:42:53.737
AN ABUNDANCE OF NURSES IN

00:42:53.804 --> 00:42:56.173
SCHOOLS THAT HAVE GRADUATED

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.242
THAT WE COULD'VE EXPEDITED AND

00:42:58.309 --> 00:43:03.547
GOTTEN INTO THE SYSTEM. SO.

00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:04.148
YOUR COMMENTS ON THAT PLEASE.

00:43:04.214 --> 00:43:05.015

ANSWER WITH THAT- WE ALREADY

00:43:08.018 --> 00:43:09.286
SEES WORK WITH OUR NURSING

00:43:09.353 --> 00:43:10.621
DEANS AND DIRECTORS WITH THE

00:43:10.688 --> 00:43:12.289
GETTING EDUCATION OUT WHAT WE

00:43:12.356 --> 00:43:14.291
SEE TYPICALLY HAPPENS IS THE

00:43:14.358 --> 00:43:16.460
NURSING STUDENT IS. VERY VERY

00:43:16.527 --> 00:43:18.162
EXCITED TO GRADUATE THEY GOING

00:43:18.228 --> 00:43:19.563
TO BE PRETTY BREEZE ACCOUNTS

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:24.134
AND THEY APPLY. THAT CAN BE TWO

00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:24.702
TO FOUR WEEKS IN ADVANCE OF

00:43:24.768 --> 00:43:26.537
THEM GRADUATING. AND ONCE THEY

00:43:26.603 --> 00:43:28.839
GRADUATE THE DEAN OR DIRECTOR

00:43:28.906 --> 00:43:30.607
HAS TO ACTUALLY GRADUATE

00:43:30.674 --> 00:43:32.309
STUDENTS OUT OF THEIR SYSTEM

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:33.477
THAT GOES TO THE REGISTRATION

00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:35.713
PROCESS OF THE SCHOOL. AND THEY

00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:37.281
PROCESS THAT THAT CAN TAKE UP

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:39.049
TO FOUR WEEKS FOR. US IS THAT

00:43:39.116 --> 00:43:40.918
AND YET THEIR TRANSCRIPTS OUT

00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:43.187
AND ISSUE THEM A DEGREE. THEN

00:43:43.253 --> 00:43:45.656
WITH THAT THEY UPLOAD THOSE

00:43:45.723 --> 00:43:48.592
TRANSCRIPTS TO THE CLOUD AND WE

00:43:48.659 --> 00:43:49.793
ACCESS AND THERE AND THEN WE

00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:51.662
START TO PROCESSING. WITH THE

00:43:51.729 --> 00:43:53.564
STUDENT DOESN'T UNDERSTAND IS

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:54.865
THAT TWO TO FOUR WEEKS THAT

00:43:54.932 --> 00:43:56.300
THEY'VE APPLIED PRIOR TO

00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:57.968
GRADUATION WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING

00:43:58.035 --> 00:43:59.737
WITH THEY HAVEN'T MET THE

00:43:59.803 --> 00:44:00.337
REQUIREMENTS THEY HAVE A RIGHT

00:44:00.404 --> 00:44:02.506
TO BE TO THE PROGRAM. THEN WITH

00:44:02.573 --> 00:44:04.041
THE NURSING PROGRAM HAVING

00:44:04.108 --> 00:44:05.409
AFTER ABOUT FOUR WEEKS TO GET

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:07.411
TRANSCRIPTS THAT'S AN EIGHT

00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:08.679
WEEK DELAY THAT THE STUDENT IS

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:11.081
SEEN PRIOR TO US EVEN RECEIVING

00:44:11.148 --> 00:44:11.949
AND PROCESSING YOUR

00:44:12.016 --> 00:44:14.852
APPLICATION. SO THAT IS WHY ONE

00:44:14.918 --> 00:44:15.753
OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED

00:44:15.819 --> 00:44:17.688
ABOUT IS WHAT WE DO TO NOT HAVE

00:44:17.755 --> 00:44:19.223
TO USE A TRANSCRIPT AND THAT'S

00:44:19.289 --> 00:44:20.457
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT DOING

00:44:20.524 --> 00:44:22.459
THAT GRADUATE CANDIDATE ROSTER.

00:44:22.526 --> 00:44:24.028
WE'RE ALL THE NURSING THREE

00:44:24.094 --> 00:44:25.462
DIRECTORS HAVE TO DO IS SUBMIT

00:44:25.529 --> 00:44:28.032
A LIST OF NAMES THAT DEGREE

00:44:28.098 --> 00:44:29.800
THAT THEY RECEIVED THAT LASTED

00:44:29.867 --> 00:44:31.135
OF ATTENDANCE AND THE DEGREE

00:44:31.201 --> 00:44:33.804
DATE THAT THAT WAS- ACQUIRED.

00:44:33.871 --> 00:44:36.373
SO THAT WAY WE CAN FIX THAT THE

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.207
OTHERTHING THAT I WANT TO

00:44:37.274 --> 00:44:39.510
BRING OUT- SO THAT YOU GUYS ARE

00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:41.445

01:02:20.236 --> 01:02:21.938
DIFFICULT THOUGH BECAUSE AS YOU

01:02:22.004 --> 01:02:23.005
HAVE POINTED OUT WHICH IS

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:24.841
ACTUALLY CORRECT IS THE ABILITY

DIVIDE AND THAT IS PROBLEMATIC.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:50.166
YOU KNOW BECAUSE IF. THEY

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:51.801
USUALLY REQUIRE. REIST EXPIRY-

01:02:51.868 --> 01:02:52.768

THAT THE BEER AND IS LOOKING

01:03:10.353 --> 01:03:11.254
OUT ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.256

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:26.795
REGIONAL LICENSURE- SURPRISE

01:14:26.862 --> 01:14:27.396
THE AGREEMENT SIGNED I THINK

01:14:27.462 --> 01:14:29.932
PROBABLY DUE TO THE COMPACT NOW

01:14:29.998 --> 01:14:32.201
THAT THE CONTACT HAS GROWN

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:34.336
ACROSS THE COUNTRY- THE NEED

01:14:34.403 --> 01:14:35.504
FOR THOSE REGIONAL CONTRACTS

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:37.239
JUST AREN'T THERE YOU KNOW

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:40.943
QUITE AS MUCH. THERE IS A NEW.

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:42.377
OUR PROPOSAL I NOT JUST

01:14:42.444 --> 01:14:44.346
PROPOSAL AND HAS BEEN ENACTED

01:14:44.413 --> 01:14:46.782
IN SOME STATES THAT IS. KIND OF

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:48.951
THE- HERMAN THIS UNIVERSAL

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:51.587
LICENSURE- IT WAS FIRST ENACTED

01:14:51.653 --> 01:14:54.423
IN ARIZONA AND WE HAVE SEEN IT-

01:14:54.489 --> 01:14:57.159
I BELIEVE MISSISSIPPI ADOPTED

01:14:57.226 --> 01:15:00.062
IT HAS BAD- FILE IS BUILDING

01:15:00.128 --> 01:15:02.264
MANY STATES OVER THE LAST

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.867
COUPLE OF YEARS- IT'S DIFFERENT

01:15:04.933 --> 01:15:06.535
FROM THE COMPACT AND THAT

01:15:06.602 --> 01:15:09.404
TYPICALLY WELL FIRST OFF IT'S-

01:15:09.471 --> 01:15:10.973
THERE'S NO MODEL LANGUAGE EACH

01:15:11.039 --> 01:15:13.041
STATE IS DOING IT. WHO IN YOUR

01:15:13.108 --> 01:15:14.509
THAT ARE INTRODUCING BILLS ARE

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:15.477
DOING IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT

01:15:15.544 --> 01:15:17.546
WAY- I KNOW AT LEAST WITH

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:19.348
ARIZONA'S WHICH WAS AGAIN THE

01:15:19.414 --> 01:15:23.418
FIRST AND FULLY FUNCTIONAL NOW-

01:15:23.485 --> 01:15:25.454
BEFORE THAT. WHAT UNIVERSE LIFE

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.189
AND THE PEOPLE CAN BE ISSUED

01:15:27.256 --> 01:15:29.057
THEY THEY'RE STILL NEED TO BE A

01:15:29.124 --> 01:15:31.460
CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK DONE-

01:15:31.526 --> 01:15:32.728
AND THEY'RE STILL NEEDS TO HEAD

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:34.496
THERE ARE STILL BEING- KIND OF

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:35.530
REQUIREMENTS THAT NEED TO BE

01:15:35.597 --> 01:15:37.366
MACRO FOR THAT LICENSE CAN BE

01:15:37.432 --> 01:15:40.035
GRANTED SO. WELL IT'S A ONE WAY

01:15:40.102 --> 01:15:44.139
FOR- ARIZONA TO. HOW DO WE

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:46.041
STREAMLINED SOME THINGS IT'S

01:15:46.108 --> 01:15:47.276
NOT GETTING PAST SOME OF THE

01:15:47.342 --> 01:15:48.744
BIGGEST HURDLES AS WERE ALREADY

01:15:48.810 --> 01:15:51.613
MENTIONED WHICH IS- THIS TIME

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:52.948
CONSUMING CRIMINAL BACKGROUND

01:15:53.015 --> 01:15:56.018
CHECKS- AT THAT TRUST SO. AND

THAT HAS BEEN ENACTED IN

01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:00.989
ARIZONA I BELIEVE THERE MAY BE

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:03.091
THREE OR FOUR STATES NOW BUT IT

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:06.495
HAS NOT- NEED NOT IN THE

01:16:06.561 --> 01:16:10.065

PRACTICE IT IMMEDIATELY YOU

FOR THAT DISASTER DECLARATION.

01:17:30.545 --> 01:17:31.613
ONE OF THE REASON THE I'LL BE

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:34.049
REALLY HELPED THOSE STATE

01:17:34.116 --> 01:17:36.084
DURING COLD READ IS THAT. IT

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:37.819
WILL WORK NUMBER ONE ONE OF THE

01:17:37.886 --> 01:17:39.521
BIG GRIEVANCES THERE WAS NO

01:17:39.588 --> 01:17:41.690
WAITING SO. EVEN THOUGH

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:42.958
ULTIMATELY ALL OF THE GOVERNOR

01:17:43.025 --> 01:17:44.626
DID ISSUE THOSE LICENSURE

01:17:44.693 --> 01:17:46.194
EXAMINATIONS IT WASN'T

01:17:46.261 --> 01:17:48.797
IMMEDIATE- THERE WERE SURGES AT

01:17:48.864 --> 01:17:49.965
DIFFERENT TIMES AND GOVERNOR'S

01:17:50.032 --> 01:17:51.700
TOOK ACTIONS AT DIFFERENT TIMES

01:17:51.767 --> 01:17:54.002
SO. IT WASN'T AS THOUGH YOU

01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:55.837
KNOW- IMMEDIATELY WHEN THE

01:17:55.904 --> 01:17:58.507
FIRST COALBED. CASE HENCE. THE

01:17:58.573 --> 01:18:00.008
LICENSES WERE IN A LIFE CHANGER

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:01.510
WITH EXAM TODAY IT TOOK A

01:18:01.576 --> 01:18:03.211
LITTLE BIT OF TIME. AND THEN

01:18:03.278 --> 01:18:04.880
ALONG THOSE SAME LINES THOSE

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:07.682
LICENSURE. EXECUTIVE ORDERS AS

01:18:07.749 --> 01:18:11.053
EXTENSION NEEDED TO BE- RENEWED

01:18:11.119 --> 01:18:12.120
IF YOU WELL MOST OF THOSE

01:18:12.187 --> 01:18:13.789
EXECUTIVE ORDERS LASTED FOR A

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:15.557
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND

01:18:15.624 --> 01:18:17.492
THEN THEY WOULD BE EXTENDED

01:18:17.559 --> 01:18:18.860
HOWEVER THE NURSES WHO ARE

01:18:18.927 --> 01:18:20.529
PRACTICING UNDER THOSE LICENSE

01:18:20.595 --> 01:18:25.500
OR EXEMPTIONS DIDN'T. KNOW FOR

01:18:25.567 --> 01:18:26.334
SURE WINNER IF THOSE. EXEMPTION

01:18:26.401 --> 01:18:28.203
WOULD BE EXTRA. OFTENTIMES I

01:18:28.270 --> 01:18:29.171
KNOW THAT THIS IS JUST AN

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:31.306
EXAMPLE FROM NEW YORK BUT THERE

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:32.441
WERE NURSES AND HOSPITAL THAT

01:18:32.507 --> 01:18:33.675
WE'RE FINDING OUT THE DAY

01:18:33.742 --> 01:18:36.778
BEFORE. THAT THE THOSE

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:38.747
EXEMPTIONS WOULD BE EXPECT

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:40.582
EXTENDED AND THEREFORE THEY

01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:42.317
COULD KEEP TREATING PATIENTS

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:44.186
ADMITTED IT WAS JUST A VERY.

01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:47.055
STRESSFUL TIME ON TOP OF AN

01:18:47.122 --> 01:18:49.024
EXTREMELY STRESSFUL TIME DURING

01:18:49.091 --> 01:18:51.827
THE PANDEMIC- SO THAT STABILITY

01:18:51.893 --> 01:18:53.061
WITH THEIR- THE OTHER REALLY

01:18:53.128 --> 01:18:53.995
IMPORTANT THING TO HIGHLIGHT

01:18:54.062 --> 01:18:55.997
ABOUT THE COMPACT IS THAT THERE

01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:57.666
IS A REQUIREMENT OF CRIMINAL

01:18:57.732 --> 01:18:59.234
BACKGROUND CHECK REQUIREMENTS.

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:00.635
SO WHEN CONTRACTORS HAS COME TO

01:19:00.702 --> 01:19:02.704
PRACTICE IN YOUR STATE THEY ARE

01:19:02.771 --> 01:19:04.539
ABLE TO IMMEDIATELY PRACTICE

01:19:04.606 --> 01:19:05.474
AND YOU KNOW THAT THEY'VE

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:07.042
ALREADY BEEN CRIMINAL BACK

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:08.310
CRIMINALLY BACKGROUND CHECKS

01:19:08.376 --> 01:19:10.912
BECAUSE THEY HAD TO DO THAT. IN

01:19:10.979 --> 01:19:13.148
ORDER TO ATTAIN THEIR COMPACT

01:19:13.215 --> 01:19:16.017
LICENSE. SO DURING THE PANDEMIC

01:19:16.084 --> 01:19:18.320
WHEN THE GOVERNOR'S DID EXEMPTS

01:19:18.386 --> 01:19:20.589
LICENSURE. THEY YOU KNOW THERE

01:19:20.655 --> 01:19:22.023
WAS NO TIME TO DO CRIMINAL

01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:24.059
BACKGROUND CHECKS OF COURSE SO.

01:19:24.126 --> 01:19:26.027
I DON'T MEAN TO NECESSARILY

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:28.063
IMPLIES THAT. A LOT OF THE

01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:29.464
NURSES CROSSING STATE LINES

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:31.233
WERE DOING ANYTHING CRIMINAL OR

01:19:31.299 --> 01:19:33.568
WORK ANY KIND OF BAD ACTORS BUT

01:19:33.635 --> 01:19:35.770
YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW IT IT DOES

01:19:35.837 --> 01:19:38.440
HAPPEN. RIGHT AND THIS IS ONE

01:19:38.507 --> 01:19:40.375
KIND OF WAY TO MAINTAIN THAT

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:42.911
PUBLIC PROTECTION- BY. KNOWING

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:43.712
THAT THE CRIMINAL BACKGROUND

01:19:43.778 --> 01:19:46.848
CHECKS HAVE BEEN DONE IN THOSE

01:19:46.915 --> 01:19:47.449
NURSES DO NOT HAVE A CRIMINAL

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:49.985
PAST. BUT WE GOT HE SAID THAT

01:19:50.051 --> 01:19:52.154
SO THE NLC. PROVIDES SOME

01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:55.190
CERTAINTY AND STABILITY- BUT MY

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:56.725
SECOND QUESTION IS THE B. R.

01:19:56.791 --> 01:19:57.726
AND HAS CITED CONTINUING

01:19:57.792 --> 01:19:59.461
EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS AS A

01:19:59.528 --> 01:20:02.898
REASON FOR WHY. CALIFORNIA MAY

01:20:02.964 --> 01:20:04.199
NOT BE FIT FOR PARTICIPATING IN

01:20:04.266 --> 01:20:05.934
THE CONTACT. IN YOUR OPINION

01:20:06.001 --> 01:20:08.937
HAVE DISCREPANCIES IN

01:20:09.004 --> 01:20:09.504
CONTINUING EDUCATION LEAD TO

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:13.074
ANY. PROBLEMS OR ISSUES- WITH

01:20:13.141 --> 01:20:17.579
ANY PARTICIPATING STATE. NOW IT

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:19.981
HASN'T- IT HASN'T AND IT YOU

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:22.250
KNOW WITH THIRTY FOUR STATES

01:20:22.317 --> 01:20:24.252
AND TERRITORIES PARTICIPATING

01:20:24.319 --> 01:20:27.122
NOW THEY THE C. E. REDACTING

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:29.090
EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS ARE

01:20:29.157 --> 01:20:31.459
VARIED ACROSS THOSE STATES- I

01:20:31.526 --> 01:20:33.461
THINK ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS

01:20:33.528 --> 01:20:35.530
WHY THIS HASN'T BECOME AN ISSUE

01:20:35.597 --> 01:20:37.866
IS THAT TYPICALLY EMPLOYERS

01:20:37.933 --> 01:20:39.734
REQUIRE TEACHING EDUCATION AND

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:41.403
PACKAGING EDUCATION AS MUCH

01:20:41.469 --> 01:20:44.439
MORE SPECIFIC TO- THAT NURSE'S

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:46.041
EMPLOYMENT AND YOU KNOW WHAT

01:20:46.107 --> 01:20:46.908
HERE SHE IS DOING ON A DAILY

01:20:46.975 --> 01:20:49.010
BASIS SO. I THINK THAT'S PART

01:20:49.077 --> 01:20:50.645
OF THE REASON IT'S NOT AS IF

01:20:50.712 --> 01:20:53.081
THE STATE DOESN'T REQUIRE SEED

01:20:53.148 --> 01:20:54.082
IT'S NOT AS IF THE NURSES ARE

01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:56.384
DOING SEE IT'S JUST THAT IT'S

01:20:56.451 --> 01:20:59.955
NOT REQUIRED. BY THE BOARD OF

01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:03.491
NURSING FOR RIGHT NOW ALL- OKAY

01:21:03.558 --> 01:21:04.259
I GOT THAT AND THAT THAT

01:21:04.326 --> 01:21:05.493
CERTAINLY- A VERY INTERESTING

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:08.997
POINT AND WHAT NOTING- IN TERMS

01:21:09.064 --> 01:21:12.167
OF- I CERTAINLY OF AN I'M MORE

01:21:12.234 --> 01:21:12.767
OF A NATIONAL EXPERIENCE BUT

01:21:12.834 --> 01:21:14.436
CERTAINLY FOR I DON'T KNOW IF

01:21:14.502 --> 01:21:15.403
YOU'VE EVER BEEN TO THE CENTRAL

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:16.771
VALLEY IN CALIFORNIA OR OTHER

01:21:16.838 --> 01:21:18.807
REAL REGIONS- WE HAVE-

01:21:18.873 --> 01:21:20.809
CHALLENGES AND STAFFING. AND

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:21.776
I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF OTHER

01:21:21.843 --> 01:21:23.612
PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES TO

01:21:23.678 --> 01:21:26.615
HAVE SIMILAR- CHALLENGES. HOW

01:21:26.681 --> 01:21:28.984
HAS THE NLC BENEFITTED RULE

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:32.087
REGIONS- AND THEN. IS THERE A

01:21:32.153 --> 01:21:34.556
IS THERE TIED TO- TELEHEALTH

01:21:34.623 --> 01:21:36.358
AND WOULD BE IN ENTERING INTO

01:21:36.424 --> 01:21:38.360
AN L. AND L. C. INTO THEM AS A

01:21:38.426 --> 01:21:40.528
CONTACT. HAS IT HELPED EXPAND

01:21:40.595 --> 01:21:43.665
TELEHEALTH AND IN THE COMPACT

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:46.401
STATE. YEAH ONE OF THE BIG WAYS

01:21:46.468 --> 01:21:48.703
THAT IT HELPS IN RURAL AREAS

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:52.507
IT'S FILLING- GAPS IN CARE SO

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:54.175
FOR YOU KNOW THERE IS A WIDE

01:21:54.242 --> 01:21:55.610
NURSING SHORTAGE OF GENERAL

01:21:55.677 --> 01:21:57.445
NURSING SHORTAGE THAT. A LOT OF

01:21:57.512 --> 01:21:58.713
AREAS AND A LOT OF STATES ARE

01:21:58.780 --> 01:22:01.583
EXPERIENCING. BUT SOME OF THE

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:06.688
MOST- URGENT NEED IS WITH

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:09.190
SPECIALTY NURSES SO WHEN I SEE

01:22:09.257 --> 01:22:11.793

SPECIALTY TRAINING AND YOU

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:16.998

RECRUIT. ANY ARE AND TO FILL

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:20.702
THOSE SPOTS. SO WE'VE SEEN

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:22.070
ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS THAT

01:22:22.137 --> 01:22:23.104
MAY HAVE A HARDER TIME

01:22:23.171 --> 01:22:25.173
RECRUITING IS SPECIALTY NURSES

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.574
WITH THE I DON'T SEE IS

01:22:26.641 --> 01:22:30.545
EXTREMELY HELPFUL- HELPING-

01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:31.446
HEALTHCARE INSTITUTIONS IN THAT

01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:34.683
AREA GREEN AND TRAVEL TEMPORARY

01:22:34.749 --> 01:22:38.620
ITS SPECIALTY NURSES. TO KIND

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:39.387
OF FILL THOSE GAPS AND KERR. AS

01:22:39.454 --> 01:22:41.723
FAR AS TELEHEALTH- IT HELLO HOW

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.391
HAS BEEN EXPANDING NOW FOR

01:22:43.458 --> 01:22:45.360
YEARS BUT THE PANDEMIC HAS

01:22:45.427 --> 01:22:49.531
REALLY. REALLY- MADE A LOT OF

01:22:49.597 --> 01:22:51.366
OUR LOT OF CONSUMERS BECOME

01:22:51.433 --> 01:22:52.600
MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE WITH

01:22:52.667 --> 01:22:53.935
TELEHEALTH BECAUSE THEY'VE

01:22:54.002 --> 01:22:55.804
THEY'VE USED IT OVER THE LAST

01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:58.173
YEAR THEY'VE BEEN FORCED TO AND

01:22:58.239 --> 01:23:00.742
REALIZE THAT THIS IS- WELL I

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:01.276
DON'T KNOW SOME MAY HAVE

01:23:01.343 --> 01:23:02.477
REALIZED THAT THIS IS A GREAT

01:23:02.544 --> 01:23:04.746
JANET PARTICULARLY FOR RURAL

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:07.716
AREAS. SO I THINK THAT WE'RE

01:23:07.782 --> 01:23:08.783
GOING TO ONLY SEE MORE

01:23:08.850 --> 01:23:10.452
EXPANSION I KNOW THAT ACROSS

01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:11.720
THE COUNTRY THEY'RE BAD MORE

01:23:11.786 --> 01:23:14.322
AND MORE LAWS- TO EXPAND THE

01:23:14.389 --> 01:23:15.457
TELEHEALTH ITS COVERAGES

01:23:15.523 --> 01:23:18.193
REIMBURSEMENT. AND THE COMPACT

01:23:18.259 --> 01:23:19.327
FACILITATE THAT IN THE SENSE

01:23:19.394 --> 01:23:21.496
THAT A NURSE COULD BE IN ONE

01:23:21.563 --> 01:23:22.997
STATE TO THE OWNERS CAN BE IN

01:23:23.064 --> 01:23:24.632
CALIFORNIA. BUT COULD BE

01:23:24.699 --> 01:23:26.334
PRACTICING ON TELEHEALTH ON

01:23:26.401 --> 01:23:28.870
PATIENTS- IN ANY CONTEXT STATE

01:23:28.937 --> 01:23:31.306
ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO A IN ONE

01:23:31.373 --> 01:23:33.341
WITH HER ONE LICENSE WHEREAS

01:23:33.408 --> 01:23:35.377
RIGHT NOW IF THAT NURSE WANTED

01:23:35.443 --> 01:23:37.245
TO PRACTICE TELEHEALTH IN. FIVE

01:23:37.312 --> 01:23:38.747
DIFFERENT STATES ACROSS THE

01:23:38.813 --> 01:23:40.014
COUNTRY HE WOULD NEED TO BE

01:23:40.081 --> 01:23:42.283
LICENSED AND- HEY LOOK LICENSE

01:23:42.350 --> 01:23:45.887
OR FEES FOR NEW THE LICENSE AND

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:49.090
THOSE FIVE STATES. SO- SO I A I

01:23:49.157 --> 01:23:49.958
JUST WANTED TO DIVE A LITTLE

01:23:50.024 --> 01:23:51.393
DEEPER EASY SPECIALTY NURSES

01:23:51.459 --> 01:23:53.094
AND WE AS IT WAS EVERYWHERE IN

01:23:53.161 --> 01:23:55.096
THE COUNTRY BUT A LOT OF US IN

01:23:55.163 --> 01:23:56.197
CALIFORNIA UNDERSTOOD THE

01:23:56.264 --> 01:23:58.166
IMPORTANCE OF AN ICU NURSE.

01:23:58.233 --> 01:23:59.567
WHICH IS VERY DISTINCT FROM

01:23:59.634 --> 01:24:01.035
ANOTHER NURSING IN THE MIDDLE

01:24:01.102 --> 01:24:02.470
OF THE PANDEMIC THAT WAS KIND

01:24:02.537 --> 01:24:03.772
OF WHAT WAS DRIVING A LOT OF

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:05.874
OUR STAFFING CAPACITIES. SO

01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:07.142
WHEN YOU SAY SPECIALLY ORDERED

01:24:07.208 --> 01:24:09.711
NURSES ICU NURSES ARE INCLUDED

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:11.346
IN THAT CORRECT. CRACKED AND

01:24:11.413 --> 01:24:13.381
ICY YOU EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT

01:24:13.448 --> 01:24:18.253
NURSES- OBGYN NURSES YEAH.

01:24:18.319 --> 01:24:20.221
PERFECT I THINK THAT'S THE ONE

01:24:20.288 --> 01:24:23.057
OF THE I GUESS TO ME IS A

01:24:23.124 --> 01:24:24.192
COMPELLING REASON FOR

01:24:24.259 --> 01:24:24.893
CALIFORNIA TO ENTER INTO THE

01:24:24.959 --> 01:24:26.694
CONTRACT IS THAT WELL WHEN WE

01:24:26.761 --> 01:24:28.163
NEED THOSE THOSE SPECIALTY

01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:29.631
NURSES ESPECIALLY IN THE RURAL

01:24:29.697 --> 01:24:31.966
REGIONS AND WE CAN'T HAVE THEM

01:24:32.033 --> 01:24:33.935
MAKING IT EASIER FOR NURSES TO

01:24:34.002 --> 01:24:35.770
COME INTO OUR REGION TO PROVIDE

01:24:35.837 --> 01:24:38.072
THAT CRITICAL. SAFETY NET AND

01:24:38.139 --> 01:24:40.575
HEALTHCARE ACCESS IS- ESSENTIAL

01:24:40.642 --> 01:24:42.143
AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION IS IN

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:44.045
A TIGHT TO THE POINT WHERE THE

01:24:44.112 --> 01:24:46.815
NLC HELP UNDERSERVED HOSPITALS

01:24:46.881 --> 01:24:47.982
MAINTAIN A STABLE SUPPLY OF

01:24:48.049 --> 01:24:51.786
NURSES IN THEIR FACILITIES IN A

01:24:51.853 --> 01:24:52.387
MORE COST EFFECTIVE MATTER IN

01:24:52.454 --> 01:24:54.722
YOUR OPINION. YEAH AND IN MY

01:24:54.789 --> 01:24:56.891
OPINION YES BECAUSE AGAIN

01:24:56.958 --> 01:24:59.928
THERE'S JUST NO.WAITING PERIOD

01:24:59.994 --> 01:25:02.864
TO BRING NURSES AND- SO I THINK

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.999
THAT IS WHERE. THE EXACT KIND

01:25:05.066 --> 01:25:06.868
OF STABILITY KNOWING THAT YOU

01:25:06.935 --> 01:25:08.269
WILL YOU HAVE A POOL OF NURSES

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:11.272
THAT CAN BE USED- IT IS HELPFUL

01:25:11.339 --> 01:25:15.710
FOR. EMPLOYERS AND- IT REDUCES

01:25:15.777 --> 01:25:17.912
LICENSURE FEES FOR NURSES AS AS

01:25:17.979 --> 01:25:19.280
WELL AS FOR EMPLOYERS OF

01:25:19.347 --> 01:25:22.450

AND CONTINUED EDUCATION AND

01:25:30.692 --> 01:25:31.392
PROBABLY ONE OF THE REASONS

01:25:31.459 --> 01:25:32.894
WHY. MANY WOULD ARGUE

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:34.596
CALIFORNIA ISN'T FIT FOR

01:25:34.662 --> 01:25:36.397
PARTICIPATING AS YOU MENTIONED.

01:25:36.464 --> 01:25:37.932

THEY MISSED ANYTHING ABOUT ONE

01:27:36.584 --> 01:27:37.585
LAST ONE DOES LIMITING

SO LIMITING ENROLLMENT ON THE

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:58.806
CURRENT ISSUE STUDENTS HAS ONE

01:27:58.873 --> 01:28:01.609
EFFECT- IF WE LIMIT IN ROMANCE

01:28:01.676 --> 01:28:03.277
OR I WOULD WANT TO SEE LIVING

01:28:03.344 --> 01:28:05.980
COSTS IF WE- MONITORING ROLEX

01:28:06.047 --> 01:28:08.416
OF THE OTHER SCHOOLS IN THAT

01:28:08.483 --> 01:28:11.185
REGION. IT HELPS ENSURE THAT

01:28:11.252 --> 01:28:12.120
THAT STUDENT WHO IS ALREADY

01:28:12.186 --> 01:28:14.222
ENROLLED CAN COMPLETE THEIR

01:28:14.288 --> 01:28:16.758
EDUCATION PROCESS AND COMPLETE

01:28:16.824 --> 01:28:18.059

ENROLLED IT DOES NOT HAVE A

01:28:24.232 --> 01:28:26.167
NEGATIVE EFFECT. THE NEXT

01:28:26.234 --> 01:28:29.303
QUESTION IS HOW DO WE NOTIFY

01:28:29.370 --> 01:28:33.241
OUR SCHOOLS IF WE'RE GOING TO

01:28:33.307 --> 01:28:34.108

01:28:42.684 --> 01:28:45.053
REGULATIONS- THAT INFORMATION

01:28:45.119 --> 01:28:46.621
IS BROUGHT TO THE BOARD. IF

A LOT OF IN LICENSURE

01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:40.180
REQUIREMENTS THAT A NURSE MUST

01:38:40.247 --> 01:38:40.848
MEET BEFORE SHE COULD BE

01:38:40.914 --> 01:38:43.350
ISSUED. A COMPACT LICENSE AND

01:38:43.417 --> 01:38:45.586

WHATEVER IS REQUIRED FROM THE

01:38:47.554 --> 01:38:50.157
STATE THAT SHE'S APPLYING FOR

LICENSURE AND- ONE OF WHICH IS

01:38:53.160 --> 01:38:55.129
A SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER AND-

01:38:55.195 --> 01:38:57.164
UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE MOST OF

01:38:57.231 --> 01:38:58.899
THE THINGS NOT EVERYTHING BUT

01:38:58.966 --> 01:39:01.135
MOST OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE

01:39:01.201 --> 01:39:03.871

THE STATES ARE JOINING

01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:11.779
TOGETHER. SO STATES CAN

01:39:11.845 --> 01:39:13.847
UNILATERALLY DECIDE WHAT

01:39:13.914 --> 01:39:15.616
THEY'RE GOING TO KIND OF TAKE

01:39:15.683 --> 01:39:17.985
OUT AND YOU KNOW OR ADD AN

01:39:18.052 --> 01:39:20.421
ADDITIONAL BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS

01:39:20.487 --> 01:39:21.055

01:39:21.121 --> 01:39:24.625

THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER

01:39:26.627 --> 01:39:28.462
REQUIREMENT IS IN SPECIFICALLY

01:39:28.529 --> 01:39:30.230
IN THE STATUTE- THAT WOULD NOT

01:39:30.297 --> 01:39:31.198
BE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE

01:39:31.265 --> 01:39:33.033
CHANGED TO UNILATERALLY BY

01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:35.169

01:39:35.235 --> 01:39:36.870
CERTAINLY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:39:36.937 --> 01:39:38.405
TO FIGURE OUT AROUND HERE IS.

01:39:38.472 --> 01:39:40.441
WHAT ASPECT OF OUR POPULATION

01:39:40.507 --> 01:39:42.476

CALIFORNIA. ARE OPERATING WITH

01:39:44.111 --> 01:39:47.848
AYE TENS AS OPPOSED TO

01:39:47.915 --> 01:39:49.416
SOMETHING ELSE TO DETERMINE-

01:39:49.483 --> 01:39:50.584

TO THE POPULATION PERCENTAGE

01:39:58.692 --> 01:40:00.294
THAT WILL NOT LET ME ASK

01:40:00.361 --> 01:40:01.528
ANOTHER QUESTION I WANT TO MAKE

01:40:01.595 --> 01:40:03.564

01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:05.566
BACKGROUND PAPER THAT WE WERE

01:40:05.632 --> 01:40:07.668

01:40:07.735 --> 01:40:09.536
THAT THE MULTI STATE LICENSES

01:40:09.603 --> 01:40:11.405

LICENSE AND COULD COME TO

01:40:31.058 --> 01:40:32.559

01:40:32.626 --> 01:40:35.396
ORDER FOR A NURSE INSTEAD OF

TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:40:52.579 --> 01:40:53.914
WOULD THAT REQUIRE THEN THAT

01:40:53.981 --> 01:40:56.016
NURSE TO OBTAIN LICENSURE IN

01:40:56.083 --> 01:40:58.652

WHERE YOU NOW RESIDE. SO IT

01:41:32.553 --> 01:41:33.887
WOULD EASE THE PROCESS AND THAT

01:41:33.954 --> 01:41:35.722
THE NURSE COULD CONTINUE TO

01:41:35.789 --> 01:41:38.225

ABOUT- THE PERCEIVED OR REAL

01:49:18.251 --> 01:49:22.255
NURSING SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA.

01:49:25.025 --> 01:49:27.360
FOCUS ON SUPPLY AND DEMAND

01:49:27.427 --> 01:49:28.962
SUPPLY IS EASIER TO UNDERSTAND

01:49:29.029 --> 01:49:30.030
THE NUMBER OF GRADUATES

01:49:30.096 --> 01:49:32.032
ENTERING THE WORKFORCE THE

01:49:32.098 --> 01:49:33.033
NUMBER OF NURSES ENDORSING FROM

01:49:33.099 --> 01:49:35.001
OUT OF STATE STATE AND THE

01:49:35.068 --> 01:49:36.870
NUMBER OF RETIREES OR PEOPLE

01:49:36.937 --> 01:49:39.439
LEAVING THE STATE. BUT WHEN WE

01:49:39.506 --> 01:49:40.573
THINK ABOUT THE NURSING

01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.008
SHORTAGE WE ALSO THINK ABOUT

01:49:42.075 --> 01:49:44.911
THE DEMANDS. AND DEMAND ON THE

01:49:44.978 --> 01:49:47.180
OTHER HAND IS MUCH HARDER. IF

01:49:47.247 --> 01:49:48.848
WE LOOK AT THE MAN'S FACTORS

01:49:48.915 --> 01:49:50.450
SUCH AS THE PARK PERCENT

01:49:50.517 --> 01:49:52.519
OCCUPANCY OF ACUTE CARE

01:49:52.585 --> 01:49:54.654

WORK FORCE AND RATIOS PLAN

01:49:58.591 --> 01:50:01.194
IMPORTANT PART IN DETERMINING

01:50:01.261 --> 01:50:02.662
THE DEMAND FOR WORKFORCE. WE

01:50:02.729 --> 01:50:03.797
KNOW THAT THEIR REGIONAL

01:50:03.863 --> 01:50:05.665
SHORTAGE OF NURSES AND THE

01:50:05.732 --> 01:50:06.666
SEVERITY OF THE SHORTAGE

01:50:06.733 --> 01:50:08.401
DEPENDS ON THE METHODOLOGY OF

01:50:08.468 --> 01:50:11.604
CALCULATING SUPPLYING DEMANDS.

01:50:11.671 --> 01:50:14.841
BOTH UCSF WORKFORCE CENTER AND

01:50:14.908 --> 01:50:17.344
ALSO HAD PROJECTIONS ILLUSTRATE

01:50:17.410 --> 01:50:19.913
REGIONAL SHORTAGES DESPITE

01:50:19.980 --> 01:50:21.448
DIFFERENCES IN METHODOLOGIES.

01:50:21.514 --> 01:50:23.116
AS AN EXAMPLE WHEN WE LOOK AT

01:50:23.183 --> 01:50:25.051
THE US HAD TO BALANCE THIS FROM

01:50:25.118 --> 01:50:27.454
LAST YEAR SOME OF THE MARKETS

01:50:27.520 --> 01:50:29.089
THE LISTS ARE VERY SMALL AND WE

01:50:29.155 --> 01:50:31.191
KNOW THAT NURSES OFTEN COMMUTE

01:50:31.257 --> 01:50:33.994
ACROSS CITIES AND COUNTIES. AND

01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:36.863
THAT IS REALLY SPECIFIC AND

01:50:36.930 --> 01:50:38.531
THEY DID A GREAT JOB. TRYING

01:50:38.598 --> 01:50:42.268
TO. ANALYZE SENT FORTY MILLION

01:50:42.335 --> 01:50:45.605
NUMBER OF. EIGHT THOUSAND NINE

01:50:45.672 --> 01:50:48.608
HUNDRED AND AREAS- THE OSHKOSH

01:50:48.675 --> 01:50:51.144
METHOD ASSUMES HOWEVER THAT THE

01:50:51.211 --> 01:50:53.480
CORRECT LEVEL MAN'S IS THE

01:50:53.546 --> 01:50:54.748
NATIONAL TWENTY FIFTH

01:50:54.814 --> 01:50:56.516
PERCENTILE WHICH IS THE LEVEL

01:50:56.583 --> 01:50:59.285
OF DEPLOYMENTS WE'VE EVER HAD

01:50:59.352 --> 01:51:00.987
IN CALIFORNIA. WE DON'T KNOW IF

01:51:01.054 --> 01:51:02.655
EMPLOYERS REALLY WANT OR NEED

01:51:02.722 --> 01:51:04.190
THAT NUMBER OF NURSES TO MEET

01:51:04.257 --> 01:51:05.759
THE CARE NEEDS OF OUR

01:51:05.825 --> 01:51:08.561
POPULATION. SO IN SUMMARY ABOUT

01:51:08.628 --> 01:51:11.598
THE STATE WIDE OPEN REGIONAL

01:51:11.664 --> 01:51:13.500
UNDERSINK SHORTAGE WE DO HAVE

01:51:13.566 --> 01:51:15.035
NURSING SHORTAGES THAT ARE

01:51:15.101 --> 01:51:17.904
REGIONAL- AND THAT IN SOME

01:51:17.971 --> 01:51:22.275
PLACES ARE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT.

01:51:22.342 --> 01:51:24.210
I ALSO WANTED. I TEND TO BUY

01:51:24.277 --> 01:51:25.845
SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT

01:51:25.912 --> 01:51:28.681
WERE RAISED TODAY- AND TALK

ABOUT HOW YOUR RENDON AS IT

01:51:31.284 --> 01:51:33.753

OPINION THE R. AND PLAYS A ROLE

01:51:35.889 --> 01:51:37.657

RESULTING IN AN EMPTY REVIEW.

02:54:46.108 --> 02:54:47.743
ALSO A RECENT STUDY JUST

02:54:47.810 --> 02:54:50.012
PUBLISHED THIS MONTH WAS ONE OF

02:54:50.079 --> 02:54:51.981
THE FIRST STUDIES TO QUANTIFY

02:54:52.048 --> 02:54:53.783
THE QUALITY AND SAFETY OF NEW

02:54:53.850 --> 02:54:55.685
GRADUATE NURSES THAT WAS

02:54:55.751 --> 02:54:57.520
CONDUCTED PRE PANDEMIC. THE

02:54:57.587 --> 02:55:00.122
STUDY FOUND THAT 1100% OF NEW

02:55:00.189 --> 02:55:01.991
GRADUATES MADE ERRORS AND

02:55:02.058 --> 02:55:04.560
FAILED TO RESCUE THEIR PATIENTS

02:55:04.627 --> 02:55:06.562
HOWEVER THE RESEARCHERS USED AN

02:55:06.629 --> 02:55:08.497
ONLINE SIMULATION PROGRAM TO

02:55:08.564 --> 02:55:10.233
IMPROVE THE CLINICAL REASONING

02:55:10.299 --> 02:55:11.701
AND DECISION MAKING AND THERE

02:55:11.767 --> 02:55:13.269
WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN

02:55:13.336 --> 02:55:14.770
THE QUALITY AND SAFETY OF THE

02:55:14.837 --> 02:55:16.973
NEW GRADS. THIS IS A CONCRETE

02:55:17.039 --> 02:55:19.542
EXAMPLE OF SIMULATION OF THE

02:55:19.609 --> 02:55:22.712
VALUE OF SAM. IN CONCLUSION WE

02:55:22.778 --> 02:55:24.347
NEED TO USE SCIENCE BASED

02:55:24.413 --> 02:55:25.514
TEACHING AND LEARNING METHODS

02:55:25.581 --> 02:55:28.084
POST PANDEMIC AND NOT GO BACK

02:55:28.150 --> 02:55:29.151
TO THE WAY WE WERE PREPEND

02:55:29.218 --> 02:55:30.753
EMMETT AS WE HAVE LEARNED SO

02:55:30.820 --> 02:55:32.788
MUCH OVER THE PAST YEAR AND WE

02:55:32.855 --> 02:55:34.490
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO APPLY.

02:55:34.557 --> 02:55:36.025
EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE

02:55:36.092 --> 02:55:38.160
ACCORDINGLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR

02:55:38.227 --> 02:55:41.097
TIME. THANK YOU MA'AM COULD YOU

02:55:41.163 --> 02:55:42.365
MAYBE YOU MENTIONED IT AND I

02:55:42.431 --> 02:55:44.166
MISSED TO SPEAK ABOUT THE COST

02:55:44.233 --> 02:55:46.669
OF SIMULATION HOW DOES THAT

02:55:46.736 --> 02:55:51.540
DOES THAT VERY AND IF SO. HOW.

02:55:51.607 --> 02:55:53.109
FIRST OF ALL THE COST OF

02:55:53.175 --> 02:55:55.811
SIMULATION- VARIES

02:55:55.878 --> 02:55:59.415
SIGNIFICANTLY ON WHAT- TYPE OF

02:55:59.482 --> 02:56:00.883
EQUIPMENT THAT YOU WOULD WOULD

02:56:00.950 --> 02:56:03.052
PURCHASE AND SOME OF THE US I

02:56:03.119 --> 02:56:04.120
THINK EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE

02:56:04.186 --> 02:56:06.822
SCHOOLS IN THE STATE HAS SOME

02:56:06.889 --> 02:56:09.926
SORT OF EQUIPMENT. AND IN TWO

02:56:09.992 --> 02:56:11.193
THOUSAND AND FIVE WHEN WE BEGAN

02:56:11.260 --> 02:56:13.329
OVER TRAINING THE REASON WE DID

02:56:13.396 --> 02:56:14.330
THE TRAINING WAS THROUGH A

02:56:14.397 --> 02:56:15.998
GRANT BECAUSE EVERYONE HAD

02:56:16.065 --> 02:56:19.735
STIMULATORS AND AT THAT TIME WE

02:56:19.802 --> 02:56:20.269
WERE VERY FOCUSED ON THIS

02:56:20.336 --> 02:56:22.204
MANNEQUIN. OVER TIME WE

02:56:22.271 --> 02:56:24.807
REALIZED THE MANNEQUIN IS ONLY

02:56:24.874 --> 02:56:27.243
ONE TYPE OF STIMULATION. AND

02:56:27.310 --> 02:56:28.844
THOSE AMERICANS RANGING IN

02:56:28.911 --> 02:56:31.580
PRICE FROM TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND

02:56:31.647 --> 02:56:32.148
TWO MAYBE A HUNDRED THOUSAND

02:56:32.214 --> 02:56:33.783
DOLLARS. WE HAVE TO ASK

02:56:33.849 --> 02:56:37.353
OURSELVES WHAT TYPE OF. HELLO

02:56:37.420 --> 02:56:39.588
G. MODALITY DO WE NEED FOR OUR

02:56:39.655 --> 02:56:40.323
STUDENTS TO ACHIEVE THE

02:56:40.389 --> 02:56:42.391
LEARNING OUTCOMES IN AN I SEE

02:56:42.458 --> 02:56:44.794
YOU FOR AN UNKNOWN ANASTASIA

02:56:44.860 --> 02:56:46.429
ENVIRONMENT YOU MIGHT NEED A

02:56:46.495 --> 02:56:47.830
VERY VERY HIGH FIDELITY

02:56:47.897 --> 02:56:50.266
EXPENSIVE AMERICAN BUT IN A PRE

02:56:50.333 --> 02:56:52.668
LICENSURE COMMUNITY COLLEGE YOU

02:56:52.735 --> 02:56:54.203
MAY NEED A MIDDLE LEVEL.

02:56:54.270 --> 02:56:56.372
MANNIKIN AND SOME STANDARDIZED

02:56:56.439 --> 02:56:57.840
PATIENTS AND IT CAN BE

02:56:57.907 --> 02:57:00.042
DETERMINED TO BE A RESOURCE

02:57:00.109 --> 02:57:01.844
ALLOCATION AND YOUR BUDGET AND

02:57:01.911 --> 02:57:04.747
THE LEARNING OUTCOMES NOT BY

02:57:04.814 --> 02:57:05.982
THE EQUIPMENT. WELL IT SEEMS

02:57:06.048 --> 02:57:07.950
SPEAK THE STANDARDS AND TO THE

02:57:08.017 --> 02:57:08.851
POINT THAT WE DON'T HAVE

02:57:08.918 --> 02:57:12.455
STANDARDS- OR IF WE DO. IF WE

02:57:12.521 --> 02:57:13.422
DON'T HAVE STANDARDS WHAT

02:57:13.489 --> 02:57:14.724
STANDARD SHOULD BE SAID AND IF

02:57:14.790 --> 02:57:16.759
WE DO HOW SHOULD OUR STANDARDS

02:57:16.826 --> 02:57:18.894
BE REVISED IN WHO SHOULD DO IT.

02:57:18.961 --> 02:57:19.895
RIGHT WELL THEY'RE ALREADY

02:57:19.962 --> 02:57:20.963
STANDARDS OUT THERE AS I

02:57:21.030 --> 02:57:24.100
MENTIONED AND OUR OUR OUR GROUP

STANDARDS AT ALL SCHOOLS WHO

02:57:35.711 --> 02:57:36.679
ARE DOING SIMULATION. SO THAT

02:57:36.746 --> 02:57:40.249
THEY COULD CAN- INSURE QUALITY

02:57:40.316 --> 02:57:41.751

BARRIERS ARE NOT JUST THE

02:58:42.445 --> 02:58:45.381
EQUIPMENT ALONE. BECAUSE YES

SIMULATORS MANICKAM BASED AND

02:58:53.255 --> 02:58:54.723
THEN THERE'S A VIRTUAL RELITY

02:58:54.790 --> 02:58:57.359
AT. WHERE IT'S ALL AUGMENTED

HUNDRED DOLLARS PER PERSON SO

03:00:08.097 --> 03:00:10.232
IF I HAVE TWENTY FIVE THAT

03:00:10.299 --> 03:00:12.801
MEANS NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS

TIMES TWENTY. PLUS THEIR TIME

03:00:14.770 --> 03:00:16.205
THAT THEY SPEND IN THAT

03:00:16.272 --> 03:00:19.475
TRAINING. ZERO YES A LOT OF IT

03:00:19.542 --> 03:00:21.110
THERE'S A LOT OF ENCOMPASSING

03:00:21.177 --> 03:00:24.113
THINGS WE WOULD LOVE TO DO 50%

03:05:52.908 --> 03:05:55.210
ARE AWARE OF THAT. BUT IT WOULD

03:05:55.277 --> 03:05:57.913
BE HELPFUL IN SITUATIONS WHERE

03:05:57.980 --> 03:05:58.714
WE NEED IT LIKE IT'S LIKE

03:05:58.780 --> 03:06:00.349
MENTAL HEALTH. I DON'T THINK

03:06:00.415 --> 03:06:01.416
I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET

03:06:01.483 --> 03:06:03.552
ENOUGH SITES FOR FALL SO IT

03:06:03.619 --> 03:06:04.853
WOULD BE NICE TO CONTINUE WITH

03:06:04.920 --> 03:06:08.657
THAT. 75% SIMULATION 25% DIRECT

03:06:08.724 --> 03:06:10.792
HERE BUT OF COURSE IF WE ARE

03:06:10.859 --> 03:06:14.830
ABLE TO- YOU KNOW I HAVE SITES

03:06:14.897 --> 03:06:16.164
FOR MEDICAL SURGICAL NURSING WE

03:06:16.231 --> 03:06:17.900
WOULD. WE WOULD WANT TO HAVE

03:06:17.966 --> 03:06:19.601
THE HIGHEST THAT WE WERE ABLE

03:06:19.668 --> 03:06:21.236
TO HELP FOR DIRECT CARE HOURS.

03:06:21.303 --> 03:06:23.138
IN TERMS OF COST IT HASN'T

03:06:23.205 --> 03:06:24.573
REALLY BEEN AN ISSUE IT IS

03:06:24.640 --> 03:06:26.074
DOCTOR WAXMAN MENTION.

03:06:26.141 --> 03:06:27.776
SIMULATIONS CHANGED OVER THE

03:06:27.843 --> 03:06:31.513
PAST TWELVE YEARS OR SO. YEAH

03:06:31.580 --> 03:06:32.281
IT'S NOT ALL AMERICAN BASED

03:06:32.347 --> 03:06:34.416
AND- WHEN THE PANDEMIC FIRST

03:06:34.483 --> 03:06:36.518
HIT IN MARCH OF TWENTY WE HAD

03:06:36.585 --> 03:06:38.487
TO JUMP TO REMOTE. LEARNING FOR

03:06:38.554 --> 03:06:40.188
OUR CLASSROOMS AND WE ALSO

03:06:40.255 --> 03:06:42.524
JUMPED TO REMOTE. AN ONLINE

03:06:42.591 --> 03:06:44.359
SIMULATION THAT WORKED ACTUALLY

03:06:44.426 --> 03:06:46.995
REALLY REALLY WELL. AND WHICH

03:06:47.062 --> 03:06:49.064
THOSE PRODUCTS THAT WE HAVE.

03:06:49.131 --> 03:06:51.233
FOR ONLINE SIMULATION. WE CAN

03:06:51.300 --> 03:06:56.038
ACTUALLY. SERVE THOSE WHO ARE

03:06:56.104 --> 03:06:58.106
REMOTE FROM FAR AWAY- AND YOU

03:06:58.173 --> 03:06:59.374
CAN HAVE THEM PARTICIPATE IN

03:06:59.441 --> 03:07:02.311
SIMULATION FROM A DISTANCE SO.

03:07:02.377 --> 03:07:03.912
THERE'S A LOT OF OPTIONS OUT

03:07:03.979 --> 03:07:05.847
THERE THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND-

03:07:05.914 --> 03:07:07.616
IT WOULD JUST BE NICE TO HAVE

03:07:07.683 --> 03:07:09.785
THE FLEXIBILITY. YOU KNOW AS

03:07:09.851 --> 03:07:11.753
EDUCATORS WE KNOW WHAT'S BEST

03:07:11.820 --> 03:07:15.591
FOR STUDENTS. AND WE CERTAINLY

03:07:15.657 --> 03:07:17.359
WOULDN'T WANT TO. NOT HAVE A

03:07:17.426 --> 03:07:19.394
HAVE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WHEN

03:07:19.461 --> 03:07:22.264
IT WAS AVAILABLE. THANK YOU FOR

03:07:22.331 --> 03:07:23.799
THAT THE RESPONSE MAYBE I'LL

03:07:23.865 --> 03:07:26.335
ASK- EVERYONE TO JUMP IN AT

03:07:26.401 --> 03:07:27.836
THIS POINT ANYONE WHO STILL ON

03:07:27.903 --> 03:07:29.972
THE LINE LET ME ASK. ONE I

03:07:30.038 --> 03:07:32.274
THINK FINAL QUESTION HAS TO DO

03:07:32.341 --> 03:07:34.176
WITH CLINICAL PLACEMENTS YOU

03:07:34.242 --> 03:07:35.777
KNOW- GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE

03:07:35.844 --> 03:07:37.312
NEED MORE NURSES AT LEAST I

03:07:37.379 --> 03:07:39.114
THINK THAT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED.

03:07:39.181 --> 03:07:40.649
CERTAINLY IN SOME PARTS OF THE

03:07:40.716 --> 03:07:43.852
STATE FOR SURE AND PERHAPS POST

03:07:43.919 --> 03:07:44.653
COVERED IN EVEN MORE PARTS OF

03:07:44.720 --> 03:07:49.091
THE STATE- WHAT CAN WE DO.

03:07:49.157 --> 03:07:50.459
WHETHER IT'S THE B. R. N. OR

03:07:50.525 --> 03:07:52.194
ANY OF THE REST OF YOU ON THE

03:07:52.260 --> 03:07:54.463
LINE WHAT CAN WE DO TO DEAL

03:07:54.529 --> 03:07:55.030
WITH THIS CLINICAL PLACEMENT

03:07:55.097 --> 03:07:58.000
ISSUE. ROSS THE BOARDS SO WE

03:07:58.066 --> 03:08:00.102
ENSURE THAT. OUR COMMUNITY

03:08:00.168 --> 03:08:01.703
COLLEGE NURSING PROGRAMS IN THE

03:08:01.770 --> 03:08:03.271
STUDENTS IN THOSE PROGRAMS THE

03:08:03.338 --> 03:08:05.540
STUDENTS IN OUR- CALIFORNIA

03:08:05.607 --> 03:08:07.509
STATE UNIVERSITY. SYSTEM

03:08:07.576 --> 03:08:10.445
PROGRAMS- STUDENTS AND OTHER.

03:08:10.512 --> 03:08:12.981
PUBLIC INSTITUTION PROGRAMS IN

03:08:13.048 --> 03:08:15.217
THE STATE AND CERTAINLY ARE- A

03:08:15.283 --> 03:08:17.185
NOT FOR PROFIT AND PROFIT TO

03:08:17.252 --> 03:08:18.687
THE PRIVATE SECTOR STUDENTS.

03:08:18.754 --> 03:08:19.955
WERE ABLE TO SECURE THE

03:08:20.022 --> 03:08:21.356
CLINICAL PLACEMENTS THAT THEY

03:08:21.423 --> 03:08:23.325
NEED IN ORDER TO. FINISH

03:08:23.392 --> 03:08:26.328
PROGRAMS AND- SECURE A

03:08:26.395 --> 03:08:27.729
LICENSURE IN THE STATE OF

03:08:27.796 --> 03:08:30.666
CALIFORNIA ANY TAKERS- I'D LIKE

03:08:30.732 --> 03:08:32.000
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS

03:08:32.067 --> 03:08:34.703
AND IF I MAY- I THINK ONE OF

03:08:34.770 --> 03:08:36.805
THE SOLUTIONS WOULD BE TO ALLOW

03:08:36.872 --> 03:08:39.474
THE SCHOOLS. THAT HAVE.

03:08:39.541 --> 03:08:41.610
RESOURCES AND HAVE TRAINED

03:08:41.677 --> 03:08:45.280
FACULTY- TO MOVE 250% BECAUSE

03:08:45.347 --> 03:08:46.281
THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE

03:08:46.348 --> 03:08:48.483
STANDARDS. IN THE MEANTIME WITH

03:08:48.550 --> 03:08:50.652
FUNDING FOR THE OTHERS. TO GET

03:08:50.719 --> 03:08:52.721
MORE FOLKS TRAINED AND THEN

03:08:52.788 --> 03:08:54.723
MOVED TO THE FIFTY PERCENT. I

03:08:54.790 --> 03:08:57.826
ALSO WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE

03:08:57.893 --> 03:08:59.761
INS SIMULATION WE CAN GUARANTEE

03:08:59.828 --> 03:09:02.297
A CLINICAL EXPERIENCE. IF WE

03:09:02.364 --> 03:09:04.966
NEED OUR STUDENTS TO. LEARN

03:09:05.033 --> 03:09:07.836
ABOUT- CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE

03:09:07.903 --> 03:09:09.071
AND THAT PATIENT ISN'T

03:09:09.137 --> 03:09:10.272
AVAILABLE IN THE CLINICAL

03:09:10.338 --> 03:09:11.773
SETTING. AND THEY DON'T GET AN

03:09:11.840 --> 03:09:14.376
OPPORTUNITY TO- CARE FOR THAT

03:09:14.443 --> 03:09:16.111
PATIENT WE CAN SET UP A

03:09:16.178 --> 03:09:18.280
SCENARIO IN SIMULATION TO

03:09:18.346 --> 03:09:20.382
GUARANTEE THOSE EXPERIENCES.

03:09:20.449 --> 03:09:22.784
AND I THINK ABOUT WHAT'S WHAT A

03:09:22.851 --> 03:09:25.087
BIG DIFFERENCE IS NOW AS IT WAS

03:09:25.153 --> 03:09:26.488
TWENTY THIRTY YEARS AGO. WE

03:09:26.555 --> 03:09:27.723
WHEN PATIENTS WERE IN FOR A

03:09:27.789 --> 03:09:29.958
LONG TIME IN A HOSPITAL. WE CAN

03:09:30.025 --> 03:09:32.728
NOW- GUARANTEE THAT. THAT

03:09:32.794 --> 03:09:34.963
EXPERIENCE IN SIMULATION AND

03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:36.064
NOT WORRY ABOUT THEM NOT

03:09:36.131 --> 03:09:37.299
GETTING THAT EXPERIENCE IN A

03:09:37.365 --> 03:09:39.334
HOSPITAL SETTING. SO THAT WOULD

03:09:39.401 --> 03:09:41.236
BE MY FIRST SUGGESTION IS THAT

03:09:41.303 --> 03:09:43.305
THE SCHOOLS AND LIKE- DOCTOR

03:09:43.371 --> 03:09:45.273
ALERT KELLY SCHOOL WHO HAVE

03:09:45.340 --> 03:09:47.442
TRANSACTION TO RESOURCES. ALLOW

03:09:47.509 --> 03:09:49.511
THEM THE FLEXIBILITY TO MOVE

03:09:49.578 --> 03:09:51.213
250% IN THE MEANTIME. WE CAN

03:09:51.279 --> 03:09:53.081
HELP GET EVERYONE ELSE IN THE

03:09:53.148 --> 03:09:57.886
STATE TRAINED. TO- MEET THOSE

03:09:57.953 --> 03:09:59.621
STANDARDS ONE BEFORE I. REALLY

03:09:59.688 --> 03:10:01.556
LOWER RIVER DEALS TO ON. PILOTA

03:10:01.623 --> 03:10:03.658
I COULD SAY. DO WE HAVE ANY

03:10:03.725 --> 03:10:04.993
REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT THE

03:10:05.060 --> 03:10:08.130
MOVE 250% SIMULATION WOULD

03:10:08.196 --> 03:10:08.697
SOLVE THE CLINICAL PLACEMENT

03:10:08.764 --> 03:10:11.566
ISSUE. SENATOR ROB THIS IS

03:10:11.633 --> 03:10:12.734
LAURIE FROM THE BOARD OF

03:10:12.801 --> 03:10:13.835
REGISTERED NURSING I CAN

03:10:13.902 --> 03:10:15.370
PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT INTO THAT

03:10:15.437 --> 03:10:17.672
THANK YOU- HOPING YOU JUMP IN

03:10:17.739 --> 03:10:19.508
HERE. THANK YOU WELL I'VE BEEN

03:10:19.574 --> 03:10:20.675
WAITING PATIENTLY I WANTED

03:10:20.742 --> 03:10:21.843
EVERYBODY ELSE HAVE A CHANCE TO

03:10:21.910 --> 03:10:23.912
SPEAK- YOU KNOW I STUDIED UNDER

03:10:23.979 --> 03:10:26.548
KßT WAXMAN- BACK IN TWENTY

03:10:26.615 --> 03:10:28.717
TEN I TOOK SUMMER COURSES AND-

03:10:28.784 --> 03:10:30.752
WHEN I WAS ENROLLED IN A PHD

03:10:30.819 --> 03:10:32.053
PROGRAM MY DISSERTATION IS

03:10:32.120 --> 03:10:34.890
GONNA BE A SIMULATION. HOWEVER-MY MOM FELL ILL AND I HAD TO

03:10:34.956 --> 03:10:37.025
DROP OUT SO I HAVE NOT YET

03:10:37.092 --> 03:10:37.626
FINISHED WITH THAT THAT'S IN

03:10:37.692 --> 03:10:39.628
THE FUTURE. IF WE ARE AND

03:10:39.694 --> 03:10:40.495
ESTABLISHES MINIMUM

03:10:40.562 --> 03:10:42.497
REQUIREMENTS. RIGHT NOW THAT WE

03:10:42.564 --> 03:10:44.966
ARE IN A SILENCE ON SIMULATION

03:10:45.033 --> 03:10:46.034
WE DON'T HAVE ANY REGULATIONS

03:10:46.101 --> 03:10:48.236
OVERSTIMULATION SO IN FACT OUR

03:10:48.303 --> 03:10:49.838
SCHOOLS CAN DO WHATEVER THEY

03:10:49.905 --> 03:10:52.274
WANT. WITH THOSE HOURS THAT ARE

03:10:52.340 --> 03:10:54.176
NOT IN DIRECT PATIENT CARE AND

03:10:54.242 --> 03:10:56.144
DO SIMULATION IT THE ABILITY TO

03:10:56.211 --> 03:10:57.646
SUPPORT THAT THEY CAN ALSO DO

03:10:57.712 --> 03:10:59.347
OTHER LEARNING MODALITIES THAT

03:10:59.414 --> 03:11:01.049
MEET THEIR CLINICAL OBJECTIVES.

03:11:01.116 --> 03:11:02.517
I THINK THAT WE ARE IN FROM

03:11:02.584 --> 03:11:04.252
BIARRITZ PERSPECTIVE THE GOAL

03:11:04.319 --> 03:11:06.221
IS TO ESTABLISH A MINIMUM

03:11:06.288 --> 03:11:09.224
CRITERIA. RIGHT NOW NCSP AND

03:11:09.291 --> 03:11:11.126
WHO WAS ON THAT CALL IS DOING A

03:11:11.193 --> 03:11:13.061
STUDY. BIERSTADT WISHING

03:11:13.128 --> 03:11:17.799
MINIMUM. DIRECT PATIENT CARE

03:11:17.866 --> 03:11:18.867
HOURS. I BELIEVE BY. TO THE

03:11:18.934 --> 03:11:21.002
PEOPLE C-SPAN THAT BABEL THAT

03:11:21.069 --> 03:11:22.838
DATA OUT TO US AS SOON AS THIS

03:11:22.904 --> 03:11:26.474
FALL. THAT DATA IF THEY STATE

03:11:26.541 --> 03:11:28.109
THAT THE MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT

03:11:28.176 --> 03:11:30.245
CARE HOURS ARE FIVE HUNDRED

03:11:30.312 --> 03:11:32.080
THEN I THINK CALIFORNIA CAN

03:11:32.147 --> 03:11:33.415
MOVE TOWARDS ESTABLISHING A

03:11:33.481 --> 03:11:34.883
MINIMUM DIRECT PATIENT CARE

03:11:34.950 --> 03:11:36.885
HOURS OF FIVE HUNDRED. AND THEN

03:11:36.952 --> 03:11:38.620
THE SCHOOLS CAN DO AS MUCH

03:11:38.687 --> 03:11:40.522
SIMULATION ABOVE THAT AS THEY

03:11:40.589 --> 03:11:42.557
CHOOSE TO DO SCHOOLS THAT HAVE

03:11:42.624 --> 03:11:45.961
THE ABILITY 225% CAN BE 25%

03:11:46.027 --> 03:11:48.563
SCHOOL THAT ABILITY TO THE 550%

03:11:48.630 --> 03:11:50.599
CAN DO FIFTY PERCENT. SCHOOLS

03:11:50.665 --> 03:11:53.034
HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO 75% CAN

03:11:53.101 --> 03:11:56.037
DO 75% WHAT WE ESTABLISH IS A

03:11:56.104 --> 03:11:57.906
DIRECT PATIENT CARE OUR AND WE

03:11:57.973 --> 03:12:00.141
STAY SILENT ON SIMULATION SO

03:12:00.208 --> 03:12:01.943
THAT THE VARIOUS PEOPLE THAT

03:12:02.010 --> 03:12:03.778
STAND BY THEIR SIMULATION

03:12:03.845 --> 03:12:05.814
STANDARDS. AND THEIR ABILITY TO

03:12:05.881 --> 03:12:06.848
SUPPORT THE SIMULATION

03:12:06.915 --> 03:12:08.617
STANDARDS CAN MOVE FORWARD AND

03:12:08.683 --> 03:12:11.386
HAVE THEIR UNIQUE CRITERIA THAT

03:12:11.453 --> 03:12:12.053
MEANS THAT THERE REGIONAL

03:12:12.120 --> 03:12:13.722
NEEDS. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

03:12:13.788 --> 03:12:16.825
NCSP UNSTEADY ON 50% SAM BAY

03:12:16.892 --> 03:12:19.027
ESTABLISHED SIX HUNDRED HOURS

03:12:19.094 --> 03:12:21.596
AS THE MINIMUM HOUR REQUIREMENT

03:12:21.663 --> 03:12:24.532
ON THAT STUDY SO IF WE COME IN

03:12:24.599 --> 03:12:26.001
ANYWHERE NEAR THERE WE'VE GOT

03:12:26.067 --> 03:12:28.203
THAT IF WE LOOK AT TODAY'S

03:12:28.270 --> 03:12:30.805
CURRENT ESTABLISHED NUMBERS. WE

03:12:30.872 --> 03:12:34.142
MEET THAT WE ARE AT. OR BELOW

03:12:34.209 --> 03:12:35.277
SIX HUNDRED HOURS IN A

03:12:35.343 --> 03:12:37.979
REQUIREMENT ON A RIDICULOUSLY

03:12:38.046 --> 03:12:40.181
ELABORATE- THE EQUATION IN OUR

03:12:40.248 --> 03:12:42.250
REGULATIONS THAT WE SHOULD

03:12:42.317 --> 03:12:44.920
REALLY BE PROACTIVE AND FIX-

03:12:44.986 --> 03:12:47.656
INNER APR AND RAISED IN

03:12:47.722 --> 03:12:49.190
FOURTEEN EIGHTY FOUR WE STATE

03:12:49.257 --> 03:12:49.758
FIVE HUNDRED DIRECT PATIENT

03:12:49.824 --> 03:12:50.492
CARE HOURS FOR NURSE

03:12:50.558 --> 03:12:52.060
PRACTITIONERS. I THINK THAT'S

03:12:52.127 --> 03:12:53.662
SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA CAN

03:12:53.728 --> 03:12:55.664
CONSIDER WHEN LOOKING AT IT IS

03:12:55.730 --> 03:12:57.365
JUST STATE YOU KNOW FIVE

03:12:57.432 --> 03:12:58.233
HUNDRED HOURS DIRECT PATIENT

03:12:58.300 --> 03:13:00.268
CARE HOURS AND THEN BE DONE-

03:13:00.335 --> 03:13:01.670
THAT ALLOWS FOR THAT

03:13:01.736 --> 03:13:02.971
FLEXIBILITY THAT ALLOWS FOR THE

03:13:03.038 --> 03:13:05.206
COMMUNITY COLLEGES IF THEY

03:13:05.273 --> 03:13:06.041
DON'T HAVE FUNDING FOR

03:13:06.107 --> 03:13:08.076
SIMULATION. THEY MEET THE FIVE

03:13:08.143 --> 03:13:08.944
HUNDRED HOURS THEY'RE DONE THEY

03:13:09.010 --> 03:13:11.246
WALK IF YOU DO HAVE A FACILITY

03:13:11.313 --> 03:13:12.714
THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT

03:13:12.781 --> 03:13:15.050
SIMULATION THEN THEY CAN DO A

03:13:15.116 --> 03:13:17.052
SIMULATION ON TOP OF WHAT WE

03:13:17.118 --> 03:13:18.620
STATUS AS A STANDARD FOR

03:13:18.687 --> 03:13:20.488
LICENSE. ANOTHER THING THAT IT

03:13:20.555 --> 03:13:27.162
BECAME REALLY AFFECT. THE

03:13:27.228 --> 03:13:28.196
CLINICAL PLACEMENTS. IS THE B.

03:13:28.263 --> 03:13:29.998
R. ESTABLISHES MINIMUM OF UNITS

03:13:30.065 --> 03:13:31.466
WE HAVE EIGHT YEAR THAT WORK.

03:13:31.533 --> 03:13:33.668
FOR THE TOLD PROGRAM TO BE

03:13:33.735 --> 03:13:36.304
DINING IN CLINICAL. WE ONLY

03:13:36.371 --> 03:13:38.340
HAVE OF SMALL PORTION OF

03:13:38.406 --> 03:13:40.408
STUDENTS OF SORRY ACADEMIC

03:13:40.475 --> 03:13:41.343
INSTITUTIONS THAT MEET THAT

03:13:41.409 --> 03:13:43.812
MINIMUM SEVERAL AND I'M I'M

03:13:43.878 --> 03:13:45.013
TRYING TO STRESS THAT WORDS

03:13:45.080 --> 03:13:47.115
SEVERAL GO ABOVE THE MINIMUM

03:13:47.182 --> 03:13:48.984
REQUIREMENTS WHEN WE LOOK AT

03:13:49.050 --> 03:13:51.353
OUR AB AND PROGRAMS. THIRTY OF

03:13:51.419 --> 03:13:53.488
THE NINETY ONE MEET EIGHTEEN

03:13:53.555 --> 03:13:56.091
UNITS THE REST ARE ABOVE THE

03:13:56.157 --> 03:13:57.325
EIGHTEEN UNITS IF WE LOOK AT

03:13:57.392 --> 03:14:00.295
RBS SAID FIVE OF THE FORTY ONE

03:14:00.362 --> 03:14:01.830
MEET OUR MINIMUM THE RESTAURANT

03:14:01.896 --> 03:14:04.065
BOB THE MINIMUM. WE LOOK AT OUR

03:14:04.132 --> 03:14:06.568
ENTRY LEVEL MASTER'S FIVE MEET

03:14:06.634 --> 03:14:08.503
THE MINIMUM. OF THE TWELVE THE

03:14:08.570 --> 03:14:11.306
REST ARE ABOVE WHEN YOU LOOK AT

03:14:11.373 --> 03:14:13.708
ONE UNITS THAT'S IN EXCESS OF

03:14:13.775 --> 03:14:15.343
THE B. R. IN REQUIREMENTS

03:14:15.410 --> 03:14:16.578
THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL FORTY

03:14:16.644 --> 03:14:17.779
EIGHT HOURS THAT THAT STUDENT

03:14:17.846 --> 03:14:19.748
IS OUT IN THE CLINICAL SETTING.

03:14:19.814 --> 03:14:21.816
YOU MULTIPLY THAT BY A HUNDRED

03:14:21.883 --> 03:14:25.420
STUDENTS WHICH IS AT YOU KNOW

03:14:25.487 --> 03:14:26.054
SOME DIFFICULT MOMENTS FOR SOME

03:14:26.121 --> 03:14:28.390
OF OUR SCHOOLS. THAT'S FOUR

03:14:28.456 --> 03:14:29.024
THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED HOURS IN

03:14:29.090 --> 03:14:31.092
A CLINICAL SETTING THAT IS NOT

03:14:31.159 --> 03:14:33.161
REQUIRED BY THE B. R. AND- SO I

03:14:33.228 --> 03:14:35.230
THINK OUR SCHOOLS. AS MENTIONED

03:14:35.296 --> 03:14:38.199
BEFORE OKAY STANDARD CURRICULUM

03:14:38.266 --> 03:14:39.567
WITH WE DID A INIMUM

03:14:39.634 --> 03:14:41.569
REQUIREMENTS. AND THAT'S ALL

03:14:41.636 --> 03:14:43.705
THAT THEY MET. THEN IT AND THEN

03:14:43.772 --> 03:14:45.273
WE ESTABLISHED A MINIMUM DIRECT

03:14:45.340 --> 03:14:47.409
PATIENT CARE WITH ABSENT IN

03:14:47.475 --> 03:14:49.044
SILENT LIKE WE CURRENTLY AREN'T

03:14:49.110 --> 03:14:50.879
REGULATIONS SILENCE ON THE

03:14:50.945 --> 03:14:53.181
SIMULATION. I THINK WE CAN MAKE

03:14:53.248 --> 03:14:55.250
A HUGE MOVES AND HAVEN'T AND

03:14:55.316 --> 03:14:57.118
EQUITABLE SOLUTION FOR OUR

03:14:57.185 --> 03:14:58.920
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND OUR

03:14:58.987 --> 03:15:01.122
PRIVATE COLLEGES- ARE EIGHTY

03:15:01.189 --> 03:15:02.524
AND AS WELL AS OUR B. S. SENATE

03:15:02.590 --> 03:15:04.392
ELN BECAUSE AGAIN WE DON'T HAVE

03:15:04.459 --> 03:15:05.660
TO BE AROUND ESTABLISH

03:15:05.727 --> 03:15:07.695
GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS. WE

03:15:07.762 --> 03:15:08.897
ESTABLISHED LICENSE

03:15:08.963 --> 03:15:11.132
REQUIREMENTS WHICH IS MUCH MUCH

03:15:11.199 --> 03:15:13.501
LESS- AND THAT ALLOWS FOR THE

03:15:13.568 --> 03:15:14.769
DEANS AND DIRECTORS WHO ARE THE

03:15:14.836 --> 03:15:16.538
EXPERTS IN THIS KNOW WHAT THEIR

03:15:16.604 --> 03:15:18.039
STUDENTS NEED TO. KNOW WHAT

03:15:18.106 --> 03:15:19.574
CURRICULA BEST SUITS THEM KNOW

03:15:19.641 --> 03:15:20.809
WHAT RESOURCES THEY HAVE

03:15:20.875 --> 03:15:22.577
INCLUDING THE FACULTY TO GO

03:15:22.644 --> 03:15:25.113
AHEAD AND STAB WISH WHAT SERVES

03:15:25.180 --> 03:15:27.082
THE BAND AND THEIR COMMUNITY. I

03:15:27.148 --> 03:15:28.349
THINK WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON

03:15:28.416 --> 03:15:29.717
THIS I THINK WE HAVE SOME GREAT

03:15:29.784 --> 03:15:30.852
DISCUSSIONS I THINK WE HAVE A

03:15:30.919 --> 03:15:32.220
LOT OF GOOD EVIDENCE COMING

03:15:32.287 --> 03:15:33.555
OUT. AND I THINK WHEN WE KIND

03:15:33.621 --> 03:15:34.889
OF STICK WITH THE PERCENTAGE

03:15:34.956 --> 03:15:37.025
WE'RE TYING OUR HANDS. I THINK

03:15:37.092 --> 03:15:38.560
THAT WE ARE IN AS A REGULATORY

03:15:38.626 --> 03:15:40.562
BODY IF WE JUST PUT A MINIMUM-DIRECT PATIENT CARE

03:15:40.628 --> 03:15:42.297
REQUIREMENTS. AND THE SCHOOLS

03:15:42.363 --> 03:15:43.331
THAT ARE ABLE TO DO WHAT THEY

03:15:43.398 --> 03:15:45.300
NEED TO A SIMULATION WE'VE

03:15:45.366 --> 03:15:46.968
ESTABLISHED A MINIMUM DIRECT

03:15:47.035 --> 03:15:47.802
PATIENT CARE REQUIREMENT WHICH

03:15:47.869 --> 03:15:49.471
ESTABLISHED PATIENT SAFETY

03:15:49.537 --> 03:15:51.239
WHICH IS WHAT OUR FOCUS IS A B.

03:15:51.306 --> 03:15:54.008
R. N. AND THEN BEYOND THAT. IS

03:15:54.075 --> 03:15:55.310
SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO

03:15:55.376 --> 03:15:56.945
GET INTO THE WEEDS ABOUT. SO

03:15:57.011 --> 03:15:58.379
PARTICULARLY FOR THE COMMUNITY

03:15:58.446 --> 03:16:00.248
COLLEGES OR COMMUNITY COLLEGE

03:16:00.315 --> 03:16:02.117
NURSING PROGRAMS. THAT ARE ARE

03:16:02.183 --> 03:16:03.418
IN A BIT OF A DIFFERENT

03:16:03.485 --> 03:16:06.454
SITUATION- THAN THAN THE OTHER

03:16:06.521 --> 03:16:08.189
PROGRAMS THAT ARE PARTICIPATED

03:16:08.256 --> 03:16:10.158
TODAY. BASED ON THE FUNDING

03:16:10.225 --> 03:16:12.227
LEVEL AND THE FEES CHARGED OR

03:16:12.293 --> 03:16:14.362
NOT- THE FUNDING OF THE

03:16:14.429 --> 03:16:15.830
PARTICULAR PROGRAMS THE WAY

03:16:15.897 --> 03:16:17.265
COMMUNITY COLLEGES GENERALLY

03:16:17.332 --> 03:16:18.967
ARE FUNDED IN THE LIMITATIONS

03:16:19.033 --> 03:16:20.368
ON BRICK AND MORTAR AND-

03:16:20.435 --> 03:16:23.338
FACULTY ALIKE. THOSE THAT ARE

03:16:23.404 --> 03:16:29.077
ABLE TO GO ABOVE. THE MINIMUM

03:16:29.144 --> 03:16:30.011
BECAUSE OF THE THERE ARE

03:16:30.078 --> 03:16:30.578
SITUATIONS IN THE REACH IN

03:16:30.645 --> 03:16:31.246
TERMS OF ACUTE ON. THAT ARE TO

03:16:31.312 --> 03:16:33.114
MAKE LOTS OF A- LIKE. FOR FREE

03:16:33.181 --> 03:16:35.483
TO SO THOSE THAT. NOT FOR SOME

03:16:35.550 --> 03:16:37.752
REASON SECURE THOSE A DIRECT

03:16:37.819 --> 03:16:38.987
PATIENT CARE OPPORTUNITIES

03:16:39.053 --> 03:16:42.590
ABOVE THE MINIMUM THEY COULDMOVE TO OTHER SOURCES. IF THEY

03:16:42.657 --> 03:16:43.892
WANT TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL

03:16:43.958 --> 03:16:45.693
TRAINING FOR STUDENTS BEFORE

03:16:45.760 --> 03:16:48.296
THEY GRADUATE THE- ABSOLUTELY

03:16:48.363 --> 03:16:49.797
WE HAVE OUR PATIENTS SAFETY WE

03:16:49.864 --> 03:16:51.466
ARE NURSING STUDENTS TAKING

03:16:51.533 --> 03:16:53.001
CARE OF AND SAFETY AND PROVIDED

03:16:53.067 --> 03:16:54.869
WITH AN ADEQUATE TRAINING. THAT

03:16:54.936 --> 03:16:56.004
IS THE DIRECT PATIENT CARE

03:16:56.070 --> 03:16:57.672
THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY WANTS YOU

03:16:57.739 --> 03:16:59.607
CAN'T YOU CAN'T LEARN TO SMELL

03:16:59.674 --> 03:17:00.808
INFECTION WHEN YOU'RE STANDING

03:17:00.875 --> 03:17:02.243
IN FRONT OF A MAN I CAN'T YOU

03:17:02.310 --> 03:17:04.479
CAN'T JUDGE A BODY LANGUAGE

03:17:04.546 --> 03:17:05.613
WHEN YOU WALK INTO THE ROOM YOU

03:17:05.680 --> 03:17:07.949
NEED A SERVICE. A SOCIOLOGY I'M

03:17:08.016 --> 03:17:10.618
SORRYA PSYCHOLOGY CONSULTATION

03:17:10.685 --> 03:17:11.786
BECAUSE SOMEBODY FLINCHED WHEN

03:17:11.853 --> 03:17:13.421
HE WALKED IN THE ROOM THOSE ARE

03:17:13.488 --> 03:17:14.088
THINGS THAT ARE REQUIRED BY

03:17:14.155 --> 03:17:16.024
DIRECT PATIENT CARE- EXPERIENCE

03:17:16.090 --> 03:17:17.759
AND WE CAN ESTABLISH THAT

03:17:17.825 --> 03:17:18.693
MINIMUM WE CAN ASSURE THAT

03:17:18.760 --> 03:17:20.295
THEIR STATE. THERE'S NOT MUCH

03:17:20.361 --> 03:17:21.496
THAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE WITH OUR

03:17:21.563 --> 03:17:23.064
REGULATIONS TO DO THAT AND IT

03:17:23.131 --> 03:17:25.066
OPENS THE DOOR FOR THE

03:17:25.133 --> 03:17:26.034
INDIVIDUAL ACADEMIC

03:17:26.100 --> 03:17:28.636
INSTITUTIONS TO IMPLEMENT WHAT

03:17:28.703 --> 03:17:29.337
THEY CAN'T AND WHAT SERVES

03:17:29.404 --> 03:17:30.838
THEIR REACH. AND WE'RE

03:17:30.905 --> 03:17:32.340
CERTAINLY I THINK YOU'RE IN THE

03:17:32.407 --> 03:17:34.042
LEGISLATURE GOING TO HAVE TO

03:17:34.108 --> 03:17:35.176
FOCUS NOT ONLY ON OUR

03:17:35.243 --> 03:17:36.744
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY

03:17:36.811 --> 03:17:38.446
PROGRAMS BUT CERTAINLY ON OUR-

03:17:38.513 --> 03:17:40.281
COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS TO

03:17:40.348 --> 03:17:41.950
MAKE SURE THAT. WE PROVIDE THE

03:17:42.016 --> 03:17:44.185
RESOURCES- THAT WE PROBABLY

03:17:44.252 --> 03:17:45.954
HAVE NOT PROVIDED IN THE PAST

03:17:46.020 --> 03:17:47.889
FOR THOSE PROGRAMS TO GIVE.

03:17:47.956 --> 03:17:49.857
THOSE PROGRAMS AN EQUAL CHANCE

03:17:49.924 --> 03:17:52.160
OF SUCCESS FOR THEIR PROGRAMS

03:17:52.227 --> 03:17:52.694
AND FOR THE STUDENTS THAT

03:17:52.760 --> 03:17:54.262
ENROLL IN THEM. ANYONE ELSE

03:17:54.329 --> 03:17:55.697
WANT TO JUMP IN ON THAT LAST

03:17:55.763 --> 03:17:59.667
QUESTION WHAT DO WE DO. WITH

03:17:59.734 --> 03:18:00.635
THE CLINICAL PLACEMENT ISSUES.

03:18:00.702 --> 03:18:03.538
I DON'T YES MA'AM I THINK WE

03:18:03.605 --> 03:18:04.505
ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT SOME OF

03:18:04.572 --> 03:18:06.908
THE OTHER REGULATIONS RELATED

03:18:06.975 --> 03:18:09.978
TO CONCURRENCY AND- WAS REMOVED

03:18:10.044 --> 03:18:11.012
BROWN'S OVERSIGHT WITH THE

03:18:11.079 --> 03:18:12.547
CLINICAL CLINICAL PLACEMENT

03:18:12.614 --> 03:18:16.017
APPROVALS I THINK THAT ALSO

03:18:16.084 --> 03:18:17.485
NEEDS TO BE EXAMINED. WHAT

03:18:17.552 --> 03:18:18.620
ABOUT THE COULD CURRENT ISSUE

03:18:18.686 --> 03:18:20.922
CLINICAL TRAINING VERSUS THEORY

03:18:20.989 --> 03:18:23.691
COURSES AND- I KNOW IN OTHER

03:18:23.758 --> 03:18:26.761
PROFESSIONS OF. YOU'RE ABLE TO

03:18:26.828 --> 03:18:29.497
SEPARATE CLINICAL FROM THEORY

03:18:29.564 --> 03:18:31.599
FRONT LOAD SOME BACK LOAD

03:18:31.666 --> 03:18:33.701
OTHERS I UNDERSTAND THERE'S

03:18:33.768 --> 03:18:36.137
SOME ISSUES. HERE IN THE STATE

03:18:36.204 --> 03:18:39.274
OF CALIFORNIA NURSING PROGRAMS

03:18:39.340 --> 03:18:44.412
THAT FORCE THEM- WELL IT'S BEEN

03:18:44.479 --> 03:18:44.979
DIFFICULT FOR US DURING THE

03:18:45.046 --> 03:18:47.148
PANDEMIC. BECAUSE THE STUDENTS

03:18:47.215 --> 03:18:48.516
WHO WERE UNABLE TO COMPLETE

03:18:48.583 --> 03:18:50.118
THEIR CLINICAL HOURS DURING A

03:18:50.184 --> 03:18:51.486
PARTICULAR SEMESTER THAN WE

03:18:51.552 --> 03:18:53.788
WERE WE'RE STRUGGLING WITH- THE

03:18:53.855 --> 03:18:55.023
CONCURRENCY OF THEIR DEGREE

03:18:55.089 --> 03:18:57.058
COURSE IN THE SUMMER OR THE

03:18:57.125 --> 03:19:00.194
SUBSEQUENT SEMESTER. AND IT

03:19:00.261 --> 03:19:01.796
JUST ADDED TO THE COMPLEXITY OF

03:19:01.863 --> 03:19:03.431
THE ISSUES WE WERE FACING WITH

03:19:03.498 --> 03:19:06.134
HAVING STUDENTS MOVE FORWARD-

03:19:06.200 --> 03:19:09.570
AND THEN ALSO RELATED TO- ORDER

03:19:09.637 --> 03:19:11.372
THROUGH ALL ADDITIONAL APPROVAL

03:19:11.439 --> 03:19:13.308
FOR CLINICAL SITES- SOMETIMES

03:19:13.374 --> 03:19:16.144
THAT THAT LIMITS US. IN TERMS

03:19:16.210 --> 03:19:17.345
OF GETTING ADDITIONAL SITES

03:19:17.412 --> 03:19:19.814
ESPECIALLY SINCE NURSING IS

03:19:19.881 --> 03:19:21.349
LOOKING MORE TOWARDS. A

03:19:21.416 --> 03:19:23.084
POPULATION BASED HEALTH CARE

03:19:23.151 --> 03:19:25.753
AND AMBULATORY CARE SOMETIMES

03:19:25.820 --> 03:19:27.121
JUST THE RED TAPE AND THE

03:19:27.188 --> 03:19:28.489
BUREAUCRACY OF GETTING

03:19:28.556 --> 03:19:30.091
ADDITIONAL SITES APPROVED

03:19:30.158 --> 03:19:32.393
THROUGH THE B. R. AND- IS NOT

03:19:32.460 --> 03:19:34.295
ENCOURAGING TRUSTOR CHANNEL

03:19:34.362 --> 03:19:35.363
SITES EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY BE

03:19:35.430 --> 03:19:37.098
THERE SO. I JUST WOULD LIKE TO

03:19:37.165 --> 03:19:39.033
SEE THAT THOSE THOSE ISSUES ARE

03:19:39.100 --> 03:19:40.301
LOOKED AT AND I DID SEE THEM IN

03:19:40.368 --> 03:19:42.103
THE REPORT SOMETHING. I

03:19:42.170 --> 03:19:43.805
APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU SEE

03:19:43.871 --> 03:19:45.907
THAT I HAVE SOME INPUT ON THAT

03:19:45.973 --> 03:19:47.208
TOO IF YOU'LL GIVE ME A CHANCE

03:19:47.275 --> 03:19:48.976
HERE MOBERLY OF THE DEANS AND

03:19:49.043 --> 03:19:50.878
DIRECTORS WITH THEIR CREDITORS

03:19:50.945 --> 03:19:53.181
AND- ONE IT IS ONE THAT WE

03:19:53.247 --> 03:19:55.049
NOTICED IN REGULATION AS WE DO

03:19:55.116 --> 03:19:56.918
NOT HAVE A REQUIREMENT TO RE

03:19:56.984 --> 03:19:58.886
APPROVED CLINICAL PLACEMENTS.

03:19:58.953 --> 03:20:00.388
SO IF WE DID ONE CLINICAL

03:20:00.455 --> 03:20:12.266
APPROVAL FOR AN INSTITUTION-

03:20:12.333 --> 03:20:12.867
AND THEY HAD IT IN A DAY BANK

03:20:12.934 --> 03:20:14.669
IS SOMETHING WE'RE AT- THEY THE

03:20:14.736 --> 03:20:15.837
SCHOOL COULD ACT THE DATA AND

03:20:15.903 --> 03:20:17.939
STATE WAS STILL ALREADY- I

03:20:18.005 --> 03:20:19.240
COULD SEE SCHOOLS THERE AND

03:20:19.307 --> 03:20:20.908
THEN THAT WAY WE HAVE. THAT A

03:20:20.975 --> 03:20:23.211
THE PROPLACE. AND ADDITIONAL

03:20:23.277 --> 03:20:25.246
CLINICAL OF ARE NOT NEEDED- IT

03:20:25.313 --> 03:20:26.314
COULD BE A ONE IN DONE IT IN

03:20:26.381 --> 03:20:27.648
SCHOOL CAN YOU ONE EIGHT

03:20:27.715 --> 03:20:29.350
CLINICAL APPROVAL- IT JUST THAT

03:20:29.417 --> 03:20:30.318
WE DONE THE INITIAL PROBE TO

03:20:30.385 --> 03:20:31.419
MAKE SURE THAT IT'S A- FOR AND

03:20:31.486 --> 03:20:37.225
IT'S SAFE. YEAR. PERFECT

03:20:37.291 --> 03:20:37.859
REPUBLICAN TO TOUCH A THE CAN.

03:20:37.925 --> 03:20:40.027
ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S A REC. THAT

03:20:40.094 --> 03:20:41.362
BUT IN THE PHYSICIAN TRAINING

03:20:41.429 --> 03:20:43.464
FIELD AND PERHAPS OTHERS. ON

03:20:43.531 --> 03:20:46.567
OCCASION. CLINICAL SPORTS FROM

03:20:46.634 --> 03:20:50.304
THREE. YOU CAN FRONT LOAD ONE.

03:20:50.371 --> 03:20:51.939
MAYBE NOT THE OTHER. HAS IT

03:20:52.006 --> 03:20:54.242
BEEN ANY THOUGHT TO CHANGING

03:20:54.308 --> 03:20:55.943
THE RULES ON THE CONCURRENCE

03:20:56.010 --> 03:20:58.579
ISSUE AS IT PERTAINS TO NURSING

03:20:58.646 --> 03:21:01.349
EDUCATION. CURRENT ISSUE IS A

03:21:01.416 --> 03:21:03.551
LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT TO KIND

03:21:03.618 --> 03:21:05.853
OF TOUCH ON BECAUSE- CLINICAL

03:21:05.920 --> 03:21:07.255
BUILDS ON PIRI PIRI BILLS AND

03:21:07.321 --> 03:21:09.457
CLINICAL IT'S A VERY SYMBIOTIC

03:21:09.524 --> 03:21:13.327
RELATIONSHIP- AND I RECEIVED

03:21:13.394 --> 03:21:14.729
COMPLAINTS FROM STUDENTS ON A

03:21:14.796 --> 03:21:16.364
REGULAR BASIS SOME THAT I

03:21:16.431 --> 03:21:18.833
FAILED OUT- AND SOME THAT ARE

03:21:18.900 --> 03:21:21.068
HAPPEN TO CONTINUE IN SCHOOL

03:21:21.135 --> 03:21:21.936
ONE OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT

03:21:22.003 --> 03:21:23.304
STANDS OUT IN MY HEAD WAS A

03:21:23.371 --> 03:21:24.138
WOMAN THAT CALLED ME AND SHE

03:21:24.205 --> 03:21:26.808
WAS IN TEARS. SHE SAID SHE WAS

03:21:26.874 --> 03:21:29.377
TAKING CARE OF A BABY THAT WAS

03:21:29.444 --> 03:21:31.746
JAUNDICED WHO HAD- WHAT'S

03:21:31.813 --> 03:21:33.514
CALLED A BILLION LIGHT ON HAND

03:21:33.581 --> 03:21:35.216
IF SHE HADN'T HAD THE THEORY ON

03:21:35.283 --> 03:21:37.718
IT YET. AND SHE DID NOT KNOW

03:21:37.785 --> 03:21:39.053
THAT THAT BABY WAS SUPPOSED TO

03:21:39.120 --> 03:21:41.823
HAVE- SOME GLASSES ON IT'S A AS

03:21:41.889 --> 03:21:44.258
A PAPER PIECE THAT GOES OVER

03:21:44.325 --> 03:21:46.494
THERE I. AND IT'S SO SHE CARED

03:21:46.561 --> 03:21:47.795
FOR THE BABY SHE WAS UNDER THE

03:21:47.862 --> 03:21:48.830
BILL THE LIKES AND IT DIDN'T

03:21:48.896 --> 03:21:50.131
HAVE THE SUNGLASSES ON SHE

03:21:50.198 --> 03:21:51.299
FAILED A CLINICAL BECAUSE SHE

03:21:51.365 --> 03:21:52.934
HADN'T HAD THE THEORY ON IT.

03:21:53.000 --> 03:21:54.802
AND SHE WASN'T NECESSARILY

03:21:54.869 --> 03:21:55.803
CONCERNED ABOUT FILLING OUT A

03:21:55.870 --> 03:21:57.371
CLINICAL WHICH SHE WAS CURRENT

03:21:57.438 --> 03:21:58.840
STARTED WAS IT SHE MIGHT HAVE

03:21:58.906 --> 03:22:00.141
BECAUSE THAT CAMPAIGN TO BE

03:22:00.208 --> 03:22:02.176
BLIND AND HAVE VISUAL PROBLEMS

03:22:02.243 --> 03:22:04.412
FOR THE REST OF ITS LIFE- THE

03:22:04.479 --> 03:22:07.248
DANGER IS THERE. SO HAVING

03:22:07.315 --> 03:22:08.983
CLINICALS CONCURRENCE WITH

03:22:09.050 --> 03:22:10.117
EERIE IS SOMETHING THAT IS

03:22:10.184 --> 03:22:12.420
SUPPORTED IN THE EVIDENCE-

03:22:12.487 --> 03:22:14.288
PATRICIA BANNER THAT IS ONE OF

03:22:14.355 --> 03:22:15.323
OUR NURSING CARE SETTINGS

03:22:15.389 --> 03:22:18.426
COMPLETELY- WORLD RENOWNED-

03:22:18.493 --> 03:22:21.162
TALKS ABOUT- HOW CLINICAL FEEDS

03:22:21.229 --> 03:22:22.997
ON VERY VERY FEES AND CLICK ON

03:22:23.064 --> 03:22:24.899
HOW TO SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP.

03:22:24.966 --> 03:22:26.267
HOW MANY DRESSES THAT THEORY

03:22:26.334 --> 03:22:27.869
PRACTICE GAP THAT WE DO SEE

03:22:27.935 --> 03:22:31.472
WITHIN OUR STUDENTS- AND WE DO

03:22:31.539 --> 03:22:32.607
A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN A

03:22:32.673 --> 03:22:35.243
SEMESTER. AT IT IS YOU CAN

03:22:35.309 --> 03:22:37.845
FRONT LOAD BE COURSE THE STATE

03:22:37.912 --> 03:22:38.746
TO SIXTEEN WEEK SEMESTER THE

03:22:38.813 --> 03:22:40.448
FIRST EIGHT WEEKS COULD BE. A

03:22:40.515 --> 03:22:41.849
SECOND EIGHT WEEKS CAN BE KIND

03:22:41.916 --> 03:22:44.252
OF CALL- YOU CAN THAT YOU CAN

03:22:44.318 --> 03:22:45.453
DO THAT THERE'S PLENTY OF

03:22:45.520 --> 03:22:46.787
PROGRAMS OUT THERE THAT DO IT I

03:22:46.854 --> 03:22:48.489
DO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT HAD A

03:22:48.556 --> 03:22:49.690
SIXTEEN WEEK SEMESTER. THE

03:22:49.757 --> 03:22:51.592
FIRST FOUR WEEKS FOR THEORY THE

03:22:51.659 --> 03:22:54.028
SECOND TWO WEEKS FROM LAB AND

03:22:54.095 --> 03:22:55.196
THE REMAINING WEEKS FOR

03:22:55.263 --> 03:22:57.331
CLINICAL PRACTICE- IN SO THEY

03:22:57.398 --> 03:22:58.633
CAN BE FLEXIBLE WITH THE IN

03:22:58.699 --> 03:23:00.468
THAT TIME FRAME TO ALLOW FOR

03:23:00.535 --> 03:23:01.536
THEIR SCHEDULING AND THEIR

03:23:01.602 --> 03:23:03.037
OUTCOMES THAT GO TO SCHOOL THEY

03:23:03.104 --> 03:23:04.906
DID THAT WERE FANTASTIC. THERE

03:23:04.972 --> 03:23:10.645
AND CLICK PASSAGE WERE. THEY

03:23:10.711 --> 03:23:12.213
WERE HAPPY WITH THE GRADUATES

03:23:12.280 --> 03:23:14.282
TO BE PRODUCED AS WELL- SO

03:23:14.348 --> 03:23:15.750
THERE ARE FLEXIBILITY BUT I

03:23:15.816 --> 03:23:17.051
THINK WE STILL NEED BE VERY

03:23:17.118 --> 03:23:17.885
CAREFUL WITH THAT BECAUSE WITH

03:23:17.952 --> 03:23:20.288
THE NURSING CARE RESEARCH REST.

03:23:20.354 --> 03:23:21.689
YOUR HUGE BREASTS THERE'S A

03:23:21.756 --> 03:23:23.891
HUGE RISK FOR OUR STUDENTS- AND

03:23:23.958 --> 03:23:25.159
I KNOW THAT IT'S BEEN

03:23:25.226 --> 03:23:26.694
INTERESTING SIMULATION AND

03:23:26.761 --> 03:23:27.828
SIMULATION IS THERE AND IT'S

03:23:27.895 --> 03:23:30.364
ABSOLUTELY HELPFUL- AND THAT'S

03:23:30.431 --> 03:23:32.900
WHY WHEN AB. TWENTY TWO EIGHTY

03:23:32.967 --> 03:23:34.035
EIGHT WAS WRITTEN THEY WROTE

03:23:34.101 --> 03:23:36.470
INTO IT THAT THE SIMULATION

03:23:36.537 --> 03:23:38.239
PART. NEEDED TO BE CONCURRENT

03:23:38.306 --> 03:23:39.674
WITH GARY AND THEN THAT THE

03:23:39.740 --> 03:23:41.008
CLINICAL CAN FOLLOW BECAUSE

03:23:41.075 --> 03:23:43.044
THEY WERE VERY MUCH AWARE OF-

03:23:43.110 --> 03:23:45.179
NEEDED TO HAVE. THAT

03:23:45.246 --> 03:23:47.949
CORRELATION SO- THAT'S THAT'S A

03:23:48.015 --> 03:23:49.550
DIFFICULT QUESTION BECAUSE IT

03:23:49.617 --> 03:23:53.588
IS SUCH A RISK. THAT YOU WHEN

03:23:53.654 --> 03:23:55.056
YOU GO TO CLINICALS AND YOU'RE

03:23:55.122 --> 03:23:56.891
JUST HAD GARY THANK CREATES

03:23:56.958 --> 03:23:58.259
QUESTIONS WHEN YOU'RE IN

03:23:58.326 --> 03:23:59.393
CLINICALS YOU HAVE THOSE

03:23:59.460 --> 03:24:00.461
EXPERIENCES YOU BRING IT BACK

03:24:00.528 --> 03:24:02.263
TO THAT AREA SECOND SEE THIS IS

03:24:02.330 --> 03:24:03.364
WHAT I EXPERIENCED. CAN YOU

03:24:03.431 --> 03:24:04.999
EXPLAIN THIS AND THEN THEY GO

03:24:05.066 --> 03:24:06.767
MORE IN DEPTH WITHOUT WITH FURY

03:24:06.834 --> 03:24:08.603
SO I HOPE THAT THAT HELPS. AND

03:24:08.669 --> 03:24:11.772
ALL BUT A REAL TENSOR WOMAN'S

03:24:11.839 --> 03:24:15.910
MOBILE I GUESS- COMPLETELY

03:24:15.977 --> 03:24:16.644
UNDERSTAND THAT. THESE

03:24:16.711 --> 03:24:17.244
PARTICULARLY AT THE- COLLEGE

03:24:17.311 --> 03:24:18.379
CALL LEVEL THE NATURE THE

03:24:18.446 --> 03:24:20.681
STUDENT. WHO GRAVITATES TOWARD

03:24:20.748 --> 03:24:22.717
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE- NURSING

03:24:22.783 --> 03:24:26.053
PROGRAM. IT IS THERE ANY

03:24:26.120 --> 03:24:27.521
POSSIBILITY TO CONSIDER THE

03:24:27.588 --> 03:24:28.556
SEPARATION OF THEORY AND

03:24:28.623 --> 03:24:29.857
CLINICAL IN THAT THE THREE

03:24:29.924 --> 03:24:31.926
COMES FIRST. BUT IF A STUDENT

03:24:31.993 --> 03:24:34.996
IS NOT ABLE TO SECURE A- A

03:24:35.062 --> 03:24:36.764
CLINICAL PLACEMENT BECAUSE THE

03:24:36.831 --> 03:24:38.466
COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAM CAN'T

03:24:38.532 --> 03:24:40.234
FIND ONE. IN THAT PARTICULAR

03:24:40.301 --> 03:24:42.703
SEMESTER IS THE STUDENT ABLE

03:24:42.770 --> 03:24:45.373
TO. FINISH THE CLINICAL IN THE

03:24:45.439 --> 03:24:48.743
FOLLOWING SEMESTER. HAVING

03:24:48.809 --> 03:24:51.679
TAKEN THE THEORY FIRST. AND I

03:24:51.746 --> 03:24:53.381
THINK WHAT WE COME INTO AN

03:24:53.447 --> 03:24:55.950
ISSUE WITH THAT IS IT IT IT'S

03:24:56.017 --> 03:24:58.285
KIND OF LIKE A BAD PAYDAY LOAN.

03:24:58.352 --> 03:25:00.187
IS THEN YOUR TAKING CLINICAL

03:25:00.254 --> 03:25:01.622
TIME FROM THE NEXT SEMESTER

03:25:01.689 --> 03:25:03.124
THAT THAT CLINICAL IS NEEDED

03:25:03.190 --> 03:25:05.593
AND THE STUDENTS COMING IN. SO

03:25:05.660 --> 03:25:07.128
IT IT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE

03:25:07.194 --> 03:25:08.496
PIPELINE OF NURSING IF YOU'RE

03:25:08.562 --> 03:25:10.698
LOOKING AT PROGRESSION OF ALL

03:25:10.765 --> 03:25:12.166
OF THE CLASSES THAT ARE COMING

03:25:12.233 --> 03:25:13.567
IN AND THE CLASSES THAT ARE

03:25:13.634 --> 03:25:15.336
MOVING OUT. YOU NEED TO

03:25:15.403 --> 03:25:15.836
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S

03:25:15.903 --> 03:25:17.538
CLINICAL REQUIREMENTS EACH ONE

03:25:17.605 --> 03:25:19.373
OF THOSE SEMESTERS SO IF YOU

03:25:19.440 --> 03:25:21.409
HOLD OVER TWENTY HOURS OF

03:25:21.475 --> 03:25:23.077
CLINICAL FROM A SEMESTER AND

03:25:23.144 --> 03:25:24.912
ADDED TO THE NEXT ONE. YOU

03:25:24.979 --> 03:25:25.913
STILL HAVE YOUR SEMESTER

03:25:25.980 --> 03:25:27.581
REQUIREMENT ALREADY THERE OF

03:25:27.648 --> 03:25:29.617
THE CLASSES YOU'RE GOLDEN AND

03:25:29.684 --> 03:25:30.217
THEN YOU HAVE TO PICK UP THE

03:25:30.284 --> 03:25:32.119
ADDITIONAL TWENTY AND THAT'S

03:25:32.186 --> 03:25:34.188
ALREADY IN A CLINICAL PLACEMENT

03:25:34.255 --> 03:25:36.190
THAT'S ALREADY HIGHLY IMPACTED.

03:25:36.257 --> 03:25:38.159
SO IT'S LIKE YOU'RE BORROWING

03:25:38.225 --> 03:25:39.694
FROM PETER TO PAY PAUL I DON'T

03:25:39.760 --> 03:25:41.429
KNOW THAT THAT STEPS NECESSARY

03:25:41.495 --> 03:25:43.097
TO SOLUTION AND THAT'S WHERE

03:25:43.164 --> 03:25:44.365
THE BOARD IS COMING IN

03:25:44.432 --> 03:25:45.633
REPEATEDLY WHEN WE LOOK AT

03:25:45.700 --> 03:25:47.601
RESOURCES. IS DO YOU HAVE THE

03:25:47.668 --> 03:25:49.370
CLINICAL PLACEMENTS TO SUPPORT

03:25:49.437 --> 03:25:50.604
THE STUDENTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY

03:25:50.671 --> 03:25:52.540
ENROLLED IN YOUR PROGRAM. AND

03:25:52.606 --> 03:25:54.408
IF NOT WE NEED TO TAKE A LOOK

03:25:54.475 --> 03:25:57.244
AT THAT- THERE ARE OPTIONS

03:25:57.311 --> 03:25:58.179
THERE ARE ANY SEIZE WORKED

03:25:58.245 --> 03:26:00.047
TIRELESSLY WITH THE PROGRAM

03:26:00.114 --> 03:26:01.515
DIRECTORS WHEN THEY CALL AND

03:26:01.582 --> 03:26:03.084
SAY HEY I LOST A CLINICAL SITE

03:26:03.150 --> 03:26:04.652
CAN YOU HELP ME. AND WE PROVIDE

03:26:04.719 --> 03:26:07.555
THEM SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES- AND

03:26:07.621 --> 03:26:09.457
OPTIONS IN ORDER TO DO THAT- I

03:26:09.523 --> 03:26:11.158
DON'T KNOW THAT THERE'S A ONE

03:26:11.225 --> 03:26:12.660
ANSWER FOR THIS BUT I DO

03:26:12.727 --> 03:26:15.429
CAUTION YOU. ONLINE THE

03:26:15.496 --> 03:26:17.665
CONCURRENCY INFERI SEPARATION

03:26:17.732 --> 03:26:19.967
THAT OPENS UP TO A LOT OF RISK

03:26:20.034 --> 03:26:21.669
THAT OPENS UP TO A LOT OF

03:26:21.736 --> 03:26:23.471
DISPLACEMENT ISSUES. AND IT

03:26:23.537 --> 03:26:25.039
TRULY WILL IMPEDE THE

03:26:25.106 --> 03:26:26.440
PROGRESSION OF THE STUDENT

03:26:26.507 --> 03:26:29.143
VERSUS. HELPING THEM PROGRESS

03:26:29.210 --> 03:26:31.445
BECAUSE WHEN YOU BORROW FIFTY

03:26:31.512 --> 03:26:32.813
BUCKS FROM YOUR NEXT PAYCHECK

03:26:32.880 --> 03:26:34.215
IN YOUR ALREADY SHORT. YOU

03:26:34.281 --> 03:26:35.449
SUCKED IT PAY THAT COULD BE

03:26:35.516 --> 03:26:36.951
BUCKS BACK AND ADD THAT NEXT

03:26:37.017 --> 03:26:38.486
PAYCHECK AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT

03:26:38.552 --> 03:26:40.087
COMES INTO EACH OTHER CRITICAL

03:26:40.154 --> 03:26:41.989
REQUIREMENT THAT NEXT SEMESTER.

03:26:42.056 --> 03:26:43.157
YOU DON'T WANT TO ADD CLINICAL

03:26:43.224 --> 03:26:44.658
HOURS TO THAT NEXT SEMESTER

03:26:44.725 --> 03:26:50.631
BECAUSE THAT JUST. CAUSES MORE

03:26:50.698 --> 03:26:51.665
ABOUT DEMANDS. COOPER HAS THE

03:26:51.732 --> 03:26:53.200
ONE THAT CAN BE CAN. IN WE

03:26:53.267 --> 03:26:54.802
ESTABLISH A- EIGHTEEN UNITS. WE

03:26:54.869 --> 03:26:55.836
DO NOT STAY YOU HAVE TO HAVE TO

03:26:55.903 --> 03:26:57.905
YOU OF P. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A-

03:26:57.972 --> 03:27:00.708
UNITS OF. LIKE WE LET THE

03:27:00.775 --> 03:27:02.743
SCHOOLS DECIDE WE JUST EIGHTEEN

03:27:02.810 --> 03:27:03.711
UNITS SO IF THEY'RE HAVING A

03:27:03.778 --> 03:27:05.880
DIFFICULT TIME. GETTING

03:27:05.946 --> 03:27:07.248
CLINICAL PLACEMENTS IN SIGHT.

03:27:07.314 --> 03:27:08.582
THEN MAYBE THEY CAN CONSIDER

03:27:08.649 --> 03:27:10.050
THAT THEY ONLY NEED A SMALLER

03:27:10.117 --> 03:27:12.553
AMOUNT A UNIT. IN THAT SITE TO

03:27:12.620 --> 03:27:15.389
ADEQUATELY MEET THEIR OUTCOMES-

03:27:15.456 --> 03:27:17.591
AND THAT AGAIN DECREASES AGAIN

03:27:17.658 --> 03:27:19.560
EVERY UNIT IS FORTY EIGHT

03:27:19.627 --> 03:27:22.029
HOURS. IN A CLINICAL THAT CAN

03:27:22.096 --> 03:27:24.999
BE MOVED AROUND FROM A STUDENT.

03:27:25.065 --> 03:27:25.900

AND- PERHAPS THE SCHOOLS THAT

03:27:34.909 --> 03:27:36.510
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF

03:27:36.577 --> 03:27:38.078
SIMULATION THAT'S PERMITTED IN

03:27:38.145 --> 03:27:39.914

ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS. OF COURSE

03:46:02.982 --> 03:46:04.550
THIS IS OLD NEWS BUT IT IS NOT

03:46:04.617 --> 03:46:06.519
OLD NEWS TO ME A JOSEPH MORRIS

03:46:06.586 --> 03:46:08.021
IS THE ONE WHO HANDED DOWN THE

03:46:08.087 --> 03:46:09.689

OFFENSE RECORD SHE INQUIRED AT

03:46:11.457 --> 03:46:12.959
THE LOWEST POINT IN OUR LIFE.

03:46:13.026 --> 03:46:15.028
ABSOLUTELY BOGGLES MY MIND HOW

03:46:15.094 --> 03:46:16.629
THESE MEN WHO ACTED UNETHICALLY

03:46:16.696 --> 03:46:17.830
ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE THE

03:46:17.897 --> 03:46:19.465
AUDACITY TO TREAT MY FIANCE

03:46:19.532 --> 03:46:21.701
LIKE A CRIMINAL. WHICH THE CBR

03:46:21.768 --> 03:46:23.036

03:46:23.102 --> 03:46:24.837
BASED ON JOSEPH MOORE'S

03:46:24.904 --> 03:46:26.973

03:46:28.641 --> 03:46:29.876
CASES OF THESE PROBATIONARY

03:46:29.943 --> 03:46:31.744

AND ORDER SIGNED BY JOSEPH

03:46:32.879 --> 03:46:35.148
MORRIS. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

03:46:35.214 --> 03:46:36.182
TO ME THAT MY FIANCE WAS

03:46:36.249 --> 03:46:37.450

03:46:44.757 --> 03:46:46.025
WHAT ACCURATE AGGRAVATE THE

03:46:46.092 --> 03:46:47.026
FURTHER IF THAT THE

PROBATIONARY NURSES ARE HELD TO

03:46:48.761 --> 03:46:50.697
A GOD STANDARD WHICH NO OTHER

ESPECIALLY THE BOARD. I

03:46:53.866 --> 03:46:54.901
RECENTLY LEARNED ABOUT A

03:46:54.968 --> 03:46:56.002
PROBATIONARY NURSE WHO HAD TO

03:46:56.069 --> 03:46:57.870
TAKE A URINE TEST AS SHE WAS IN

03:46:57.937 --> 03:46:59.272
