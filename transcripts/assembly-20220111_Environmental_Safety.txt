SUFFICIENT OKAY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL HI YOUR BILL IS ON THE SOUTHERN LOS ANGELES OCEAN CHEMICAL WASTE COMMUNITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL. ALL RIGHT PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB FIFTEEN FIFTY THREE WHICH WILL ESTABLISH THE SOUTHERNMOST SANDALS OCEAN CHEMICAL WASTE COMMUNITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL I DID NOT GIVE WITH THAT NAME- WHICH WILL OVERSEE THE STUDY AND MITIGATION OF CHEMICAL WASTE IN THE ST PETER BASIN. THOSE ARE THE OCEANS OFF LONG BEACH- PALACE VERDES CATALINA. IN TWENTY NINETEEN SCIENTISTS FROM UC SANTA BARBARA PUBLISHED THEIR FINDINGS FROM A MULTI YEAR EXAMINATION OF A SITE ON THE OCEAN FLOOR. IN THE SAMPEDRO BASIN. THROUGH THE USE OF UNDERWATER SUBMERSIBLES THESE SCIENTISTS DISCOVERED A LONG FORGOTTEN DUMPING GROUND FOR TOXIC WASTE INCLUDING DDT WASTE BYPRODUCTS AND SEVERAL OTHER WAYS CHEMICALS THAT HAVE YET TO BE IDENTIFIED. RECENT MAPPING OF THE SITE SURE THAT MORE THAN TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND BARRELS OF WASTE ON THE OCEAN FLOOR MAKE THIS SITE ONE OF THE LARGEST SOURCES OF CONTAMINANTS IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN. MITIGATING THE DAMAGE FROM THE CHEMICAL WASTE AT THIS SITE WILL BE A COMPLICATED. MULTI YEAR EFFORT THAT WILL REQUIRE COORDINATION BY SCIENTISTS ACTIVISTS ELECTED OFFICIALS. AND MULTIPLE GOVERNMENTAL AND NON GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES. TO PROPERLY PERFORM THIS NECESSARY WORK THESE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS NEED A WAY TO COLLABORATE AND COOPERATE THAT ALLOWS FOR TRANSPARENCY. AND PUBLIC INPUT. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY THREE WILL PROVIDE A PUBLIC VENUE FOR THIS COLLABORATION BY CREATING A COUNCIL TO BRING TOGETHER STAKEHOLDERS EXPERTS AND POLICY MAKERS. TO OVERSEE THE STUDY AND MITIGATION OF CHEMICAL WASTE. OFF OUR SHORES. TESTIFYING BY PHONE TODAY WITH ME MISTER CHAIR IS KATHERINE PEASE WITH HEAL THE BAY. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION ARM PHONE MODERATOR COULD WE HEAR FROM CATHERINE PIECE. I CURRENTLY DON'T SEE HER DIAL THERE CATHERINE IF YOU ARE ON THE PHONE LINE YOU MAY PRESS ONE ZERO AND I WILL YOUR LINE. ONE MOMENT HERE. THANKS TO HIS SESSIONS INCLUDE OKAY. FROM A PRETTY WIDE OPEN. THANK YOU.% GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR PARK AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DR KATHERINE PEASE MAN THE DIRECTOR OF SCIENCE AND POLICY AT HEAL THE BAY HILL THE BAY AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL NONPROFIT DEDICATED TO MAKING THE COASTAL WATERS AND WATERSHED THE GREATER LOS ANGELES FACE HEALTHY AND CLEAN WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB FIFTEEN FIFTY THREE AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL ON THE BILL. HEAL THE BAY HAS BEEN WORKING TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC FROM DDT CONTAMINATION AT THE WELL KNOWN PALACE VERDES SHELF YOU BURKE ON SITE FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. THE DISCOVERY OR REDISCOVERY OF THE DEEP WATER DUMPING OF DDT WAS A COMPLETE SHOCK TO US DESPITE HAVING WORKED ON THIS ISSUE FOR SO LONG IMPACTING COASTAL RESOURCES AND PEOPLE ACROSS THE WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. PEOPLE WHO EAT SEAFOOD FROM THIS REGION OFTEN SUBSISTENCE ANGLERS FEEDING THEIR FAMILIES AND AMONG OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS ARE AT RISK OF DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS REPRODUCTIVE HARM AND CANCERS. WE KNOW THE ANIMALS SUCH AS FISH AND MARINE MAMMALS. THEY MAY INGEST TOXINS DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THE FOOD CHAIN AND THEY CARRY THOSE POLLUTANTS IN THEIR BODY BODIES AS THEY TRAVEL OR MIGRATE. EIGHTEEN IMPACT IN THE PAST AND ARE SEEING IMPACTS TO WILDLIFE TODAY. IT WILL TAKE A WELL COORDINATED EFFORT BY STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES AND STAKEHOLDERS TO BEGIN TO ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM. CURRENTLY IT IS HARD TO OBTAIN INFORMATION AND UPDATES ON THE ISSUE EVEN FOR A GROUP LIKE KILL THE BAY THAT HAS SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE AND CONTACTS ON THE- MATTER. FURTHER NO ONE AGENCY HAS TAKEN CLEAR LEADERSHIP AND THERE'S NO SYSTEM TO ENSURE ACCOUNTABILITY. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY THREE WILL EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY CREATING A COMMUNITY OVERSIGHT COUNCIL ON THE DUMPING OF TOXIC PDT WASTE IN THE DEEP OCEAN. AB FIFTEEN FIFTY THREE IS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP AN INCREASE IN COMMUNICATION TRANSPARENCY REBUILDING PUBLIC TRUST. AND TACKLING THIS PROBLEM THAT HAS REPERCUSSIONS FOR HUMAN AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. PUBLISHING THE COUNCIL WILL ALLOW THE PUBLIC AND STAKEHOLDERS TO BE INFORMED AND HAVE A VOICE. AN ISSUE OF SUCH URGENCY CENTRALIZED EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE GOOD COMMUNICATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND PROGRESS ON THIS ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH DISASTER. ELEVENTH STRONGLY SUPPORTS EIGHTY FIFTEEN FIFTY THREE AND WE URGE ABOUT IT TODAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. THANK YOU- WE DO NOT HAVE A PRIMARY- WITNESS IN OPPOSITION SO PHONE MODERATOR- PLEASE SEE IF WE HAVE ANYONE ON THE PHONE.

YOUR CONCERNS- REGARDING- THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE DDT- BARRELS ARE JUST SITTING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN FLOOR- YOU KNOW FEARS WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS RIGHT AWAY I MEAN I LIKE TO GO SURFING RIGHT NEARBY AT TO. THAT ARE APPROPRIATELY NAMED RAT BEACH AND THEN IN TORRANCE AND- IT- JUST TO CONFIRM THAT THAT IT WAS SAFE- NOT ONLY FOR MYSELF BUT FOR MY FAMILY MY- MIGHT MY CONSTITUENTS AND- YOU KNOW WHY. ALL THE TESTS INDICATED THAT- THAT THE DDT HASN'T- IT ESCAPE TO THE LEVEL THAT IT POSES A THREAT TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC- STILL YET JUST THE THOUGHT OF HAVING HUNDREDS OF BARRELS OF DDT LYING ON THE FLOOR- IS OBVIOUSLY UPSETTING AND CONCERNING TO ALL OF US- MISTER DON I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF- IF YOU CAN. CONSIDER DDING ME AS A AS A JOINT AUTHORS TO HIGH UP OF- AUTHOR AS YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE AND ADDING ME I KNOW YOU DID ALL THE WORK AND- AND I APPRECIATE TO HEAR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS- BUT- I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE- I'M GONNA REYES WHO JUST TO CONCERN OF MY OWN. WE REALLY. PLEASE CONSULT WITH OUR COMMITTEE STAFF I AM CONCERNED THAT THERE'S NO LEAD AGENCY AND WHILE IT'S GREAT TO HAVE A COORDINATING COMMITTEE THIS GOES THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS WHETHER. YOU KNOW IT SEEMS TO ME WE'VE GOT THERE SHOULD BE A CORE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY TAKING THE LEAD HERE. MAYBE NOT BUT- LET'S LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS AFTER WE PASSED THE BILL. ARE ALSO ARMED. WITH SO IF WE END UP WITH A LOT OF AGENCIES INVOLVED. I'M WORRIED ALL THE PAPERWORK WILL TAKE. MONTHS OR YEARS BEFORE WE DO SOMETHING SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO. IT MAY BE A CONVERSATION WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IT MAY BE ANOTHER BILL. THAT WOULD LOOK AT IN IN MARCH OR APRIL- BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT WE GET THIS DONE POST HASTE. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS COUNCIL CAN DO IT. I'M ALSO WORRIED ABOUT GET THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE ON THAT THAT THE COSTS WILL APPEAR TO BE LARGE- SO. THERE'S A VARIETY OF THINGS AND I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU AND YOUR WITNESS THAT THIS IS TOP PRIORITY AND WITH MR MERITS YOU CHEATED. EVERYONE ELSE ON THIS COMMITTEE. THIS IS GOT TO BE A VERY HIGH PRIORITY- DDT COULD LAST VIRTUALLY FOREVER. AND SO AWARE OF THIS IS THIS IS A BIG DEAL. BOB YOU MAY CLOSE YES THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FOR YOUR THOUGHTS AND CONCERNS AND CERTAINLY WILL TAKE THEM INTO ACCOUNT AS THE BILL MOVES TO THE PROCESS BY THE EFFORT OF THOSE OF THE BILL AT A MINIMUM IS TO ENSURE- COMMUNICATION.
