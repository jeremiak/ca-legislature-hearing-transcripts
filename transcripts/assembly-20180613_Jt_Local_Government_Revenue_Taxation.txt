TO THE VOTERS IN THE NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION. ACCORDING TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S TITLE AND SUMMARY THIS INITIATIVE IF PASSEDBY THE VOTERS WOULD EXPAND REQUIREMENTS FOR SUPERMAJORITY APPROVAL TO ENACT NEW LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUE MEASURES. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING THE LIVELY DISCUSSION FROM OUR PANELISTS AND TO GAINING A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE VOTER INITIATIVE. YOU USE ALL CERTAINLY HAVE YOUR WORK CUT OUT FOR YOU TRUST ME. THANK YOU FOR THE CHAIR OF REVENUE TAX ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE. AND HER COMMITTEE STAFF AND OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR JOINING US TODAY. AS FOR KRYCEK TO SEND SOME COOLER. GOOD AFTERNOON YOU ARE MUCH MORE POLITE AND I AM LIVELY WAS A VERY KIND WORDS I I WANNA THINK YOU. AND THE COMMITTEE ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS THE MEMBERS AND THE SPEAKERS FOR TAKING THE TIME TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS VERY IMPORTANT. A INFORMATIONAL HEARING AS WE LISTEN TODAY THE SPEAKERS I'M INTERESTED IN HEARING WHY FROM THEIR PERSPECTIVE IN SIXTEEN LIES INEFFICIENT. BY PROTECTING THE PUBLIC FROM HIGHER TAXES AYE I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM ALL OF YOU AND HAVING A AND BALANCE DEBATE. I AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO ASK OUR MEMBERS YOU ALL TO PLEASE HOLD OFF ON QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER THE SPEAKERS HAVE COMPLETED THEIR PRESENTATIONS. WITHOUT LET'S START TO HEAR FROM RYAN MILLER FROM ELLIOT OFFICE MISTER MILLER WOULD YOU MIND COMING FOREIGN. THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIRS MEMBERS RYAN MILLER FROM THE LA SHOW -- SERGEANT IS -- DISTRIBUTING A HANDOUT THAT WE'VE PRODUCED I'LL BE PROVIDING A AN OVERVIEW OF AN INITIATIVE THAT CHANGES THE RULES AND VOTE THRESHOLDS FOR INCREASING TAXES AND FEES. I WANTED TO START WITH A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF OUR OFFICES ROLE IN THE IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT FROM -- ARE TYPICAL ROLE IN REVIEWING NO BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS AND AND OTHER POLICY MATTERS -- THE VOTERS TASK OUR OFFICE WITH PROVIDING AN IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS OF EACH MEASURE THAT APPEARS ON THE BALLOT -- AND SO WHILE IN OTHER CONTEXTS WERE OFTEN ABLE -- TO COMMENT ON THE MERITS OF AN IDEA -- IN THIS -- HEARING -- WE WOULD HAVE TO DO QUESTIONS TO THE PROPONENTS AND OPPONENTS -- THE FIRST PART OF OUR ROLE IS TO PRODUCE A AND A LETTER ALONGSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- THAT PROVIDES AN ESTIMATE OF THE FISCAL EFFECTS OF OF A MEASURE THAT'S DISTRIBUTED WITH THE TITLE AND SUMMARY THAT GOES. OUT FOR SIGNATURES -- MY COMMENTS TODAY WILL LARGELY REFLECT OUR ANALYSIS IN THAT LETTER BECAUSE WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THE SECOND PART OF OUR TASK WHICH IS TO PRODUCE. I'M IMPARTIAL ANALYSIS THAT WILL APPEAR IN THE VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE. ON PAGES TWO AND THREE WE HAVE SOME -- BASIC BACKGROUND INFORMATION ABOUT STATE AND LOCAL FINANCES I WANTED TO FOCUS IN PARTICULAR. ON RULES IN VOTE THRESHOLDS -- AT THE STATE LEVEL THE STATE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THAT INCREASES IN TAXES RECEIVE. A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF EACH HOUSE OF THE LEGISLATURE -- NOW THE LEGISLATURE CAN INCREASE FEES -- WITH THE MAJORITY VOTE -- VOTERS ON THE OTHER HAND -- CAN INCREASE TAXES OR FEES WITH A SIMPLE MAJORITY OF THE STATEWIDE ELECTORATE. BY COMPARISON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TEND TO FACE ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS AND INCREASING TAXES THEY REQUIRE VOTER APPROVAL -- FOR INCREASING TAXES AT SOME MEASURES REQUIRE A MAJORITY VOTE PAUL OTHERS REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE. I GENERALLY SPEAKING -- TAX REVENUES OVER WHICH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE MORE DISCRETION IN THEIR USE -- ONLY REQUIRE A MAJORITY VOTE OF THE ELECTORATE -- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- REGARDING FEES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HE'S WITH A WITH -- WITHOUT VOTER APPROVAL. ON PAGE FOUR WE HAVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE KEY PROVISIONS OF THE MEASURE -- THIS MEASURE WOULD EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF ATTACKS IN THE STAKE IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION SPECIFICALLY IT WOULD EXPAND THE DEFINITION TO INCLUDE SOME TYPES OF CHARGES THAT THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN CURRENTLY IMPOSE AS FEES -- THIS WOULD MEAN THAT MORE TYPES OF STATE LOCAL REVENUE GENERATING MEASURES WOULD BE SUBJECT TO HIGHER VOTE THRESHOLDS FOR TAXES. THE MEASURE ALSO INCREASES SOME VOTE THRESHOLDS FOR LOCAL TAXES GENERALLY ANY INCREASE IN LOCAL TAXES WOULD HAVE TO BE APPROVED BY EITHER A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE LOCAL GOVERNING BODY IN A TWO THIRDS VOTE. OF THE ELECTORATE IN THAT JURISDICTION. OR A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE ELECTORATE IN THE CASE OF CITIZEN INITIATIVES -- THE MEASURE REQUIRES THAT -- ALLOWABLE USES OF TAX -- REVENUES BE SPECIFIED -- IF IF A MEASURE FOR EXAMPLE -- WOULD ALLOW -- REVENUES TO BE USED FOR ANY PURPOSE -- THE STATE OR LOCAL LIVE IMPOSING THAT TAX WOULD HAVE TO STATE -- WHO AT THE STATE SO -- AND LASTLY ON THAT PAGE -- THE MEASURE INCREASES VOTE THRESHOLDS FOR SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENT FEES -- SPECIFICALLY -- TWO THIRDS VOTE IN THE CASE OF A OF A LOCAL GOVERNING BODY IN THE CASE OF LOCAL FEES. OR A TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE ELECTORATE IN THE CUT CASE OF LOCAL CITIZEN INITIATIVE FEES -- ALSO NOTABLY THE MEASURE WOULD ALLOW. FEES IMPOSED BY LOCAL GOVERNING BODY TO BE SUBJECT TO CITIZEN REFERENDA -- REGARDING THE FISCAL EFFECTS OF THE MEASURE -- THE FISCAL AFFECTS WOULD DEPEND ON VARIETY OF FUTURE -- DECISIONS BY THE COURTS -- BY THE LEGISLATURE LOCAL GOVERNING BODIES BY VOTERS -- FOR EXAMPLE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE MEASURE WOULD EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF TAXES AYE AND US THE NUMBER OF MEASURES SUBJECT HIGHER VOTE THRESHOLDS. WOULD DEPEND A LOT ON FUTURE COURT DECISIONS -- HOWEVER BECAUSE REVENUE MEASURES AFFECTED BY THE VERVE RIGHT BECAUSE THE MEASURES AFFECTED BY THAT INITIATIVES ARE SUCH A SMALL PART OF THE STATE BUDGET WE THINK THAT THE FISCAL EFFECTS ON THE STATE LIKELY WOULD BE MINOR -- ON THE OTHER HAND -- FISCAL EFFECT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD ALSO DEPEND ON FUTURE COURT DECISIONS AND AND SIMILAR FACTORS -- WE NOTE IN THE HANDOUT HOWEVER THAT -- ROUGHLY HALF OF THE MAJORITY VOTE TAX MEASURES THAT HAVE BEEN ENACTED SINCE. TWENTY TWELVE AYE WHICH RAISED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF I DID NOT RECEIVE THE TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE ELECTORATE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED HAD THE MEASURE BUT THERE FOR THE FUTURE REDUCTION AND LOCAL TAX REVENUE COULD BE SAID. AND THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A MOTHER ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE YES MISTER PER CUSTOMER WORK. YES. THE WHAT'S A FEE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOES THAT INCLUDE THINGS LIKE CHANGES IN THOUGH WERE OUT WATER BILLS -- SEWER SEWER FEES IT CETERA WOULD THAT INCLUDE THOSE -- SO PROPOSITION TWENTY SIX WITH IT'S PAST AND TWENTY TEN SPECIFICALLY EXAMS A FEW DIFFERENT TYPES OF FEES -- BUT THERE ARE SO THERE ARE ALSO SOME FEES THAT IT CAN BE IMPOSED UNDER DIFFERENT BY THE CONSTITUTION MY COLLEAGUE CAROL IN CHIU CONSPIRATOR OKAY BY CAROLINE TO ELLIOT THAT SO. THE MEASURE -- PROPERTY RELATED FEES WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY PROPOSITION -- TWO EIGHTEEN COULD BE READ AS BEING EXEMPT FROM THIS MEASURES AFFECTS [inaudible] THERE ARE. AT SOME PLACES HOWEVER WHERE ONE COULD READ THE MEASURE AS TO INCLUDE THEM I'M SO THAT MAY BE A DECISION THAT COURTS WOULD HAVE -- TO TO WAY IN ON LATER ON YOU ALSO COULD US THAT THE PROPONENTS OF THE MEASURE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY INTENDED TO AFFECT -- BUT LOCAL FEES THAT ARE PART OF THE PROP TREATING ARGUE BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY INTEND WHAT MATTERS IS HOW THE COURT A COURT ORDER TO PREDICT THAT'S FOR AND IN FEE IF YOU REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE. TO INCREASE WATER BILL WATER BILLS WATER CHARGES SEWER CHARGES. THERE'S SOME DISTRICTS ARE GONNA HAVE WATER AND SEWER JUST ST. MY DISTRICT PROBABLY FINE WE TYPICALLY GET SEVENTY OR 80%. ACTUALLY I SHOULDN'T SAY THAT IN SOME AREAS OF THE NORTHERN PART OF MY DISTRICT. SEVENTY OR 80% IS NORMAL. THE OTHER PARTS OF MY DISTRICT THEY DEAF TO GIVE UP ON HAVING WATER AND SEWER. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. I THINK AT THIS TIME WHAT WE'LL DO IS WE'LL BRING UP THE PROPONENTS AND HAVE THEIR DISCUSSION SO IF YOU DON'T MIND STICKING AROUND TO FREE OF ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AND I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE. QUITE A FEW QUESTIONS AFTER WE GET THROUGH EACH ONE OF THE PANELS. IN SAW THANK YOU FOR YOUR INFORMATION AT THIS POINT AND LET'S SEE HOW THE PROPONENTS AND LEFT -- WE HAVE -- MISTER BELL DEVIOUS. CITY COUNCIL MEMBER FROM THE CITY OF SAN BERNARDINO. A MISTER ROBERT LAPSED THE PRESIDENT IN THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE. IN MISTER HURT BENITO PARTNER AND NIELSEN REC SUMMER. AND WE WELCOME YOU REALLY HAVE A LOT OF YOU FIFTEEN MINUTES TO BE SPLIT BETWEEN THE THREE WILL. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR IS MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HERE TODAY. AND WE WILL. KEEP EXACTLY WERE FIFTEEN MINUTES SO THANK YOU SO. WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY THIS GAS ATTACKS FAIRNESS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF TWENTY TWO EIGHTEEN WHICH IS CURRENTLY ON TRACK TO APPEAR ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. CALIFORNIA'S HIGH TAX DATA TO STAY LOCAL GOVERNMENT LEVEL WE ALL LIVE WITH THAT. BUT THE PUSH FOR MORE REVENUES NOT JUST TAXES BUT ALSO FEES CONTINUES TO GROW. AND THAT IS ON TOP OF OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH. THAT HAS GIVEN US RECORD REVENUES AND A SEVENTEEN BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET SURPLUS. FORTUNATELY CALIFORNIANS ARE VERY GENEROUS. IN SUPPORTING ADDITIONAL TAX REVENUE TO THE STATE AND THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. BUT THEIR SUPPORT FOR THESE TAX INCREASES HAS ALWAYS BEEN TIED TO A SERIES OF VOTER APPROVED TAXPAYER PROTECTIONS INCLUDING PROP THIRTEEN IN. NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT PROP TWO EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN NINETY SIX AND PROP TWENTY SIX IN. TWO THOUSAND TEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN WITH THESE TAXPAYER PROTECTIONS IN PLACE. STATE TAX AND FEE REVENUE HAS INCREASED BY SEVENTY THREE BILLION TO PROJECTED A HUNDRED NINETY FIVE BILLION THIS YEAR. LOCAL GOVERNMENT TAX AND FEE REVENUE HAS INCREASED BY FORTY SEVEN BILLION. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO AGAIN A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION AND LOCAL REVENUE. AND TWENTY SIXTEEN AND THAT'S GOOD NEWS THAT IS VERY GOOD NEWS. BUT THE BAD NEWS IS THAT SEVERAL COURT DECISIONS. IF SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKENED PROPS TO EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY SIX LEAVING CALIFORNIA TO VULNERABLE. TO NEW AND HIGHER TAXES AND FEES WITH LESS ACCOUNTABILITY. OVERSIGHT AND CONTROL OVER HOW THEIR MONEY IS BEING SPENT. THE LOOPHOLES CREATED BY THESE COURT DECISIONS ARE ALREADY BEING EXPLOITED BY CITIES. THE CITY SAN FRANCISCO TOOK TO THE BALLOT A PARCEL TAX LAST WEEK. THAT REQUIRED JUST MAJORITY SUPPORT. UNDER VOTER APPROVED PROP TO EIGHTEEN THIS SHOULD HAVE REQUIRED A TWO THIRDS VOTE TO PASS. BUT THE CITY USE ONE OF THESE LOOPHOLES TO UNDERMINE THE CLEAR WILL OF THE VOTERS. I REQUIRE ONLY MAJORITY SUPPORT FOR PASSAGE. THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING. THAT IS WHY THE SAME BROAD BASED COALITION THAT CAME TOGETHER PASSED PROP TWENTY SIX EIGHT YEARS AGO. S. COME BACK TOGETHER THIS YEAR SUPPORT THE TAXPAYER PROTECTION ACT. THIS MEASURE GIVES VOTERS THE OPPORTUNITY ONCE AND FOR ALL REAFFIRMED THEIR SUPPORT. FOR INCREASED TAXPAYER PROTECTIONS. WITH EVEN STRONGER ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY PROVISIONS. THE TAXPAYER PROTECTION ACT HAS THREE KEY PROVISIONS TO RESTORE THE PROP THE PROTECTIONS. PROPS TO EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX IT REQUIRES ELECTED OFFICIALS TO CLEARLY IDENTIFY HOW REVENUES CAN BE SPENT. BEFORE ANY TAX OR FEES AND ACT. IT REQUIRES NEW REVENUE TO ONLY BE SPENT WHERE VOTERS APPROVED AND NOT BE DIVERTED TO OTHER PURPOSES. AND BY MANDATING THESE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY PROVISIONS IT MAKES ALL NEW LOCAL TAXES INTO SPECIAL TAXES. WHICH ALREADY REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE TO PASS UNDER CURRENT LAW AND REFORM BY THIS MEASURE. THESE PROVISIONS ARE NOT NEW CONCEPTS. I HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY CALIFORNIANS FOR DECADES. THIS MEASURES CARE OF CAREFULLY CRAFTED TO RESTORE VOTER APPROVED TAXPAYER PROTECTIONS. AND BRING MUCH NEEDED ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AND HOW OUR FUTURE TAX DOLLARS ARE SPENT. SO TAKE FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. MAYOR STEINBERG WANTS TO INVEST IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HELP DISADVANTAGED COMMUNICATE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND DEDICATED MORE RESOURCES TO POLICE FIRE AND OTHER VITAL SERVICES. THESE ARE ALL GOALS WE CAN SUPPORT. THE MAYOR'S ASKING FOR PERMANENT TAX INCREASES TO IMPLEMENT HIS VISION OF POLICIES. BUT WILL THE NEXT CITY COUNCIL AND MAYOR SHARE THOSE SAME GOALS. COMMITTED OF ELEMENT REQUIRES LONG TERM INVESTMENT. BUT WITHOUT THE LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE USE OF FUNDS. PROVISION THAT IS INCLUDED TAXPAYER PROTECTION ACT. AND WITH THE LOOPHOLES CREATED BY RECENT COURT DECISIONS. THOSE INVESTMENTS MIGHT ONLY LAST AS LONG AS THE MAYOR'S TENURE IN OFFICE. ARE COMMUNITIES POLICE OR FIRE SERVICES DOES OR DESERVE LONG TERM FUNDING GUARANTEES. AS I CLOSE I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON WHAT THIS MEASURE DOES NOT DO. IT DOES NOT AFFECT CITY'S EXISTING REVENUE STREAMS. NOR THE DECISION MAKING. AUTHORITY OVER REVENUE THEY HAVE TODAY [inaudible] EVERYTHING STAYS THE SAME. THIS MEASURE ONLY APPLIES TO NEW AND HIGHER REVENUE MEASURES PASSED AFTER JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY EIGHTEEN BY APPLYING INCREASED ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY PROVISIONS. IT DOES NOT STOP CITIES FROM BEING ABLE TO RAISE REVENUE IN THE FUTURE. SENSE TWO THOUSAND AND TEN CITIES HAVE PLACED OVER SIX HUNDRED AND THIRTY TAX MEASURES WHICH ALREADY REQUIRED US TWO THIRDS VOTE. ON THE BALLOT. ALMOST 60% PASSED. CLEARLY THE HIGHER THRESHOLD HASN'T DISSUADED CITIES FROM RAISING REVENUE THIS WAY AND MOREOVER VOTERS HAVE A HISTORY OF STRONG SUPPORT FOR TAX MEASURES. THAT PROVIDE CLEAR DIRECTION ON HOW NEW TAX REVENUE WILL BE SPENT. PROP. SIXTY NINE IT'S JUST CREATED A LOCK BOX FOR NEW S. B. ONE TRANSPORTATION TAX REVENUE. PASSED LAST WEEK WITH AN OVERWHELMING 81% SUPPORT SO. FOR THOSE WHO OPPOSED MEASURE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK WHY. BUT CALIFORNIANS ALREADY FACING SOME OF THE HIGHEST COST OF LIVING IN THE COUNTRY. WHAT IS WRONG WITH IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY? AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND GIVING RESIDENTS MORE CONTROL. OVER HOW NEW TAX DOLLARS ARE SPENT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES NOW. WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUE MISTER CORONADO -- WHO'S GOING TO GO INTO GREATER DETAIL ON THE COURT CASES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE COCKER NETTO HERE ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION SUPPORTING THE TAXPAYER PROTECTION ACT. COLLEGES FOLLOW ONE WITTE THE COMETS IT NOT ROB JUST PROVIDED. A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ON THE WAY OUR COURTS HAVE TREATED THESE PROVISIONS -- AND OUR STATE CONSTITUTION AT A BY VOTERS GOING BACK OVER. THE LAST FORTY PLUS YEARS -- THE TAXPAYER PROTECTION ACT IS SIMPLY THE LATEST CHAPTER IN THIS LONG STANDING TUG OF WAR BETWEEN VOTERS ON THE ONE HAND AND COURTS ON THE OTHER -- REGARDING THE NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN HOW NOT TAX DOLLARS ARE SPENT AS ROB POINTED OUT. NOW THIS BEGAN IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WITH THE ADOPTION OF PROP THIRTEEN WHICH CAP PROPERTY TAXES. RECORDED TWO THIRDS VOTE OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR STATE TAXES. AND RECORDED TWO THIRDS VOTE ELECTRIC FOR ALL SPECIAL TAXES. HOWEVER JUST FOUR SHORT YEARS LATER. VOWED SUPREME COURT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO IN THE LOS ANGELES VERSES RICHMOND'S HAND SERVICES COVERAGE THAT'S FOR ALL DECISIONS INTERPRETED. PROP THIRTEEN AYE IN THE END NEAR WORST POSSIBLE MANNER -- NAY TREATED SEVERAL LOOPHOLES NOW THAT ALLOW THE THE TWO THIRDS VOTE FOR SPECIAL TAX. A REQUIREMENT OUT TO BE ELIMINATED AND IN MANY INSTANCES IN ORDER TO PLUG THOSE LOOPHOLES. THE COURT ARE THE THE VOTERS ARE FORCED TO COME BACK IN IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX WITH PROP. SIXTY TWO AND AS ROB MENTIONED PROP TWO EIGHTEEN IN. NINETEEN NINETY SIX IN ORDER CLARIFY THAT THE OF THE IMPOSITION OF TAXES FEES. AND ASSESSMENTS OUR SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED RULES IN THE CONSTITUTION INCLUDING THE TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT. FOR SPECIAL TAXES AND ALL LOCAL DISTRICTS IN AGENCIES NO EXCEPTIONS -- UNFORTUNATELY SHORTLY AFTER THE ADOPTION OF PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN A PRACTICE DEVELOPED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHERE. MANY TAXES WERE PLACED ON THE BALLOT WITH ZERO LEGAL RESTRICTION ON HOW THE REVENUES FROM -- THOSE TAXES COULD BE SPENT -- BUT DAY A A NON BINDING PROMISE WOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS FOR THE MEASURE ARE POTENTIALLY -- IN A COMPANION ADVISORY MEASURE STATING A PREFERENCE AND HOW THE MONEY SHOULD BE SPENT -- WITH THE APPARENT INTENTION OF OF CREATING THE BELIEF AMONG VOTERS IF THERE WERE SOME LEGAL RESTRICTION ON HOW THE ON HOW MONIES COULD BE SPENT WHEN IN FACT THERE'S THERE'S NO LEGAL RESTRICTION AT ALL -- SO WHAT'S THE TAX WAS PASSED INTO THAT SORT OF ASSUMPTION THAT THE MONEY HAD SOME LEGAL RESTRICTIONS ON ITS USE -- THE MONEY COULD ACTUALLY BE DIVERTED TO ANY ANY -- LEGAL PURPOSE -- THE COURTS EVENTUALLY BLESS THIS THIS MECHANISM EVEN THOUGH IT WAS. IN VIOLATION OF THE SPIRIT OF PROP THIRTEEN PROP TWO EIGHTEEN IN A NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT TAKES CALLED. COLEMAN VERSUS CITY OF SANTA CLARA. AT THE STATE LEVEL OF AT THE SAME TIME -- THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN DECISION FROM OUR STATE SUPREME COURT THE SINCLAIR PAIN VERSUS BOARD OF EQUALIZATION DECISION IT ALSO CARVED OUT A LOOPHOLE FROM FOR PROP THIRTEEN IS A TWO THIRDS VOTE REQUIREMENT FOR TAXES AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND THIS WOULD TO A SURGEON HIDDEN TAXES -- THAT THE VOTERS FOUND THE CORRECTED WITH THE ADOPTION OF PROPOSITION TWENTY SIX IN. TWO THOUSAND TEN AS ROB MENTION NOW THAT WAS ONLY ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO. BUT THE TUG OF WAR CONTINUES TODAY BETWEEN THE VOTERS IN THE COURTS. AS ROB MENTIONED OUT SYSTEM THESE IN THE SHORT YEAR SINCE THE ADOPTION OF PROPOSITION TWENTY SIX WE'VE HAD NO FEWER THAN. THREE DECISIONS FROM OUR COURTS THAT HAVE HAVE IN SOME WAY TO GET UNDER MY PROPOSITION -- TWENTY SIX THE FIRST BEING THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE VERSES AIR RESOURCES BOARD CASE WHICH CREDITED GIANT CARVE OUT TO THE REQUIREMENTS [inaudible] STATE LEVEL -- THE SHAMIR VERSES LOS ANGELES COUNTY CASE WHICH CREATED A CARVE OUT UNDER PROP TWENTY SIX FOR CHARGES THAT THE GOVERNMENT MANDATES BE PAID OVER TO A NON GOVERNMENT PARTY THAT CARRIES OUT GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS. AND PERHAPS MOST EGREGIOUS IS THE THE TASTY CITY OF UPLAND CASE THAT ROB ALSO ALLUDED. TO WHICH IMPLIED THAT PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEENS REQUIREMENTS MIGHT NOT APPLY TO LOCAL TAXES THAT ARE PLACED ON THE BALLOT. BY VOTER INITIATIVES -- YEAH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE NOT AS ROB MENTIONED -- WAITED AROUND FOR THE COURTS TO MAKE A RULING ON THAT -- TO CLARIFY THEY HAVE GONE FORWARD AND PLACED -- MAJORITY VOTE SPECIAL TAXES ON THE BALLOT FOR VOTER SIGNATURES. AND ALLOW THOSE TO BECOME LAW IN THE DIRECTION OF ON A SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTER APPROVAL INSTEAD OF THE TWO THIRDS VOTE -- SO -- THE PURPOSE OF THE TAXPAYER PROTECTION ACT IS. TO IS TO RESTORE AND REINFORCED THE VOTER APPROVED PROTECTIONS AND PROP THIRTEEN PROP TWO EIGHTEEN AND PROP. TWENTY SIX AND TO REVERSE THESE COURT DECISIONS THE THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE LAST EIGHT YEARS. I'M SO THE VOTERS HAVE THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT THEY THAT THEY'VE BEEN SEEKING SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WITH THE ADOPTION OF PROP THIRTEEN THANK YOU. THANK OVER MUCH MADAM CHAIR LIKE TO INTRODUCE IF I COULD -- I'VE MISTER JOHN BELL D. VIA IS A CITY COUNCIL FOR THE CITY OF SAN BERNARDINO HE'LL DISCUSS FURTHER THE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. I THINK YOU ROB BUT MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS JOHN BELL D. VIA AND I SERVICE AMBER MEDINA CITY COUNCILMAN. IT'S AN HONOR TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH I WAS RAISED AND BORN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY TO OFFER MY PERSPECTIVE ON THE FOR ON THE TAX FAIRNESS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHICH IS ALSO REFERRED TO AS THE TAXPAYER. PROTECTION. I MEET WITH PEOPLE ON A DAILY BASIS OUT AND ABOUT IN MY CONSTITUENCY MY COMMUNITY WHO TELL ME ABOUT THE MANY ECONOMIC CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE. BE IT IN RUNNING THEIR BUSINESS HAVING TO WORK LONGER HOURS TO MAKE ENDS MEET. THE COST OF A INCREASED GAS OR HOW MUCH GOES TO HOW MUCH COSTS WELL INCREASE BECAUSE IT IT IS TO REGISTER THEIR BUSINESS FLEET. AS ONE OF THE HIGHEST TAXED STATES IN THE NATION MANY CALIFORNIA FAMILIES LIKE THOSE IN SABATINO. ARE ALREADY FINANCIALLY OVERBURDENED AND STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. THAT'S WHY I WAS VERY PLEASED ABOUT THE COUNT ABILITY IN TRANSPARENCY PROVISIONS IN THE TAX PAYER PROVISION ACT. IT WILL ENSURE THAT NEW TAX REVENUES WILL BE USED FOR THE PROGRAMS THEY ARE INTENDED TO SUPPORT. AND ARE NOT DIVERTED ELSEWHERE WITHOUT THE PUBLIC'S PERMISSION. CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE CONSISTENTLY DEMANDED ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE RIGHT TO VOTE ON THE AMOUNTS OF TAX INCREASES THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PAY TO STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AS HIGHLIGHTED PREVIOUSLY WITH PROPOSITION THIRTEEN PROPOSITION TWO EIGHTEEN AND RICK MOST RECENTLY IN TWENTY TEN WITH PROPOSITION. TWENTY SIX UNFORTUNATELY THESE PROTECTIONS HAVE BEEN UNDERMINED BY A NUMBER OF ILL ADVISED COURT DECISIONS. THE TAXPAYER PROTECTION THAT NOT ONLY CLOSES THESE ON FAIR I LEGAL LOOPHOLES AND RESTORES VOTER APPROVED TAXPAYER PROTECTIONS BUT IT ALSO PROVIDES GREATER PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY. AND ACCOUNTABILITY. I KNOW THAT SEVERAL OF YOU. SERVED IN A A AS A FORMER LOCAL OIL ELECTED OFFICIAL ACROSS OUR STATE. I'M APPRECIATIVE FOR YOUR SERVICE YOU ALSO HAVE THOSE SAME CONCERNS ABOUT THE LOOK ABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO RAISE NECESSARY REVENUE TO SUPPORT THE MANY DEMANDS ARE CITIES FACE. THE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURE WILL MAKE ALL LOCAL TAXES SPECIAL TAXES. ALREADY REQUIRE TWO THIRDS VOTE TO PASS. THIS THRESHOLD WAS PASSED INTO LAW BY VOTERS MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO. HOWEVER THIS MEASURE WAS CAREFULLY DRAFTED SO THAT IT DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY EX EXISTING REVENUES PASSED BEFORE JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THE OVERWHELMING BULK OF LOCAL. OF FINANCES ARE COMPLETELY UNAFFECTED. ONLY NEW TAXES AND FEES ARE AFFECTED. EVEN THEN THE IMPACT IS VERY LIMITED. NOTHING I REPEAT NOTHING IN THIS MEASURE WILL AFFECT ANY CITY'S ABILITY TO USE EXISTING TAX DOLLARS WITH THE SAME FLEXIBILITY AND DISCRETION IT HAS TODAY [inaudible] IN FACT ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE BIGGEST GENERATORS OF NEW TAXES WERE SPECIAL AND PARCEL TAXES. WHICH ARE UNAFFECTED BY THIS MEASURE AS THEY ALREADY REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE. SINCE JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN UP UNTIL LAST WEEK'S ELECTION ELEVEN LOCAL REVENUE MEASURES HAVE BEEN PASSED BY VOTERS. AND THEY WERE ALL APPROVED BY GREATER THAN A TWO THIRDS VOTE. AND WOULD THEREFORE BE UNAFFECTED BY DESTINATION OF RESTORING PREVIOUSLY APPROVED TAXPAYER PROTECTIONS AND PUSHING FOR GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY. ON HOW NEW TAX REVENUE BILL WILL BE SPENT ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IN KEEPING COSTS DOWN. FOR OUR HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS. LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS SHOULD NOT BE FEARFUL OF THIS TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT IN FACT THE TAXPAYERS DESERVE TO KNOW WHERE THEIR TALK TAX DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MANY MEMBERS THREE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS JUST -- MISTER CROW SORRY SO -- WILL JUST HAVE TO DISAGREE AGREE TO DISAGREE I'M NOT. YOU'RE KIND A CONSTITUENT BUT THAT'S THAT'S OKAY DECODERS WILL DECIDE. WHAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE QUESTION I ASKED LEDGE COUNCIL AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR INTENTION WAS -- ABOUT REQUIRING IT WHETHER OR NOT YOU WOULD WANT TO REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE. FOR I ANY INCREASE IN -- CHARGES FOR WIDER ISSUE WHERE -- SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THAT IS COULD YOU RESPOND. SO I'VE I THINK IT RESPOND THAT QUESTION -- FIRST I WOULD AGREE WITH MISTER MILLER FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THAT. COURTS FRICKLEY -- HOW TO DECIDE THESE QUESTIONS BECAUSE FRANKLY THEY ALWAYS END UP DECIDING THIS QUESTION SEVEN HOPEFULLY I LAY THAT OUT -- BUT IN TERMS OF THE THE PROVISIONS OF THE MEASURE -- ARTICLE THIRTEEN D. CHARGES -- CHARGES A PROPERTY RELATED CHARGES AND FEES OF THOSE ARE CATEGORICALLY EXEMPT UNDER THE MEASURE THAT'S IT AS AS ELIOT MENTIONED AS A SEPARATE. PROVISION TO CONSTITUTION ARTICLE THIRTEEN D. THAT IS UNAFFECTED BY THIS MEASURE THIS MEASURE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OF DEALS WITH ARTICLE THIRTEEN SEE EVEN IN THE HYPOTHETICAL SCENARIO WHERE THEY WOULD BE COVERED BY ARTICLE THIRTEEN C. OVER THIS MEASURE OUT LIVES IN OUR NOT. OTHERS EXISTING NOT EXEMPTIONS FROM THE DEFINITION OF TAX FOR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE CONSTITUTION SINCE. TWENTY TEN OUR THAT EXCLUSION -- FROM THE DEFINITION OF TAX FOR SERVICES AND PRODUCTS -- IS CONTINUED ON IN THIS MEASURE. PASO ANY SERVICE LIKE WATER SERVICE SEWER SERVICE EVEN UNDER THE MOST EXTREME YOU KNOW -- INTERPRETATION OF THE MEASURE -- SO THERE'S REALLY NO SCENARIO WHERE -- STUFF PROPERLY CHARGES COULD BE COVERED BY THE MEASURE WOULD BE TURNED INTO A TAX OKAY SO ARMED THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. AND THAT'S FINE AND I'M I'M VERY GLAD THAT THAT'S YOUR OPINION. I AM CONCERNED THAT OTHERS READ IT DIFFERENTLY. AND IF YOU COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS PROCESS [inaudible] TO JUST MAKE THAT LITTLE BIT MORE CLEAR AND I BELIEVE YOU ARE ABLE TO DO THAT THROUGH THIS PROCESS. FIND OUT WHY THEIR QUESTIONS AND MAKE THAT MORE CLEAR. I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT. CHUCK I THINK THERE'S ALWAYS ALWAYS QUESTIONS AND WHEN IT COMES TO CONSTITUTIONAL INITIATIVES AND IN THE INTENT OF THE MAJORS NOT TO COVER ARTICLE THIRD OKAY WELL FEES INTERMITTENTLY YOU AGREED TO TALK TO THE LA O. AND OTHERS WHO HAVE THIS CONCERN AND SEE IF THERE IS A WAY. THAT WE CAN ABSOLUTELY. A BE SURE THAT THAT WON'T HAPPEN. SO MISTER QUIRK WE WE HAVE HAD DISCUSSIONS WE WILL FOLLOW UP WILL HAVE MORE DISCUSSIONS SO YES SIR OKAY THANK YOU THAT'S ALL I CAN ASK AND WE JUST ARE GOING TO AGREE TO DISAGREE UNDERSTOOD AND WE VERY APPRECIATE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. YES WOULDN'T US SOME BROKE TAKING THAT CHAIR JEALOUS THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION OF I GUESS THE THING THAT JUMPED OUT ON ME PREPARING FOR THIS HEARING IS. JUST THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- EIGHTY TWO BILLION AND LOCAL CHARGES SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN ELECTRICS CHARGES UP FIVE POINT SIX BILLION A 30% INCREASE WATER CHARGES UP FOURTEEN BILLION OF GARBAGE RECYCLING UP SIX POINT SIX BILLION A TWENTY SIX POINT PARKS IRAQ'S PUBLIC. PARKING DOCUMENT FEES TRANCE TOT TAXES -- THESE NUMBERS ARE INCREASING SOMETIMES A HUNDRED AND 30% JUST A IN THIS DECADE -- AND I SERVED ON CITY COUNCIL AND SOMETIMES THESE ENTITIES DO THIS FUND BUDGETING FUND MANAGEMENT BUDGETING AND IT'S EASY TO HIDE THINGS THAT. AREN'T MEANT FOR THEIR PURPOSE AND FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE IN ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE -- IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WE ASKED THE VOTERS TO APPROVE MEASURE RAM. IT'S ABSENT SALES TAX FOR TRANSPORTATION. AND IT WAS REAUTHORIZED AND THAT HE HAS WIDE SUPPORT. BECAUSE CTA THE TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITIES DON WHAT THEY TOLD PEOPLE THEY'RE GONNA DO THEY SPENT THE MONEY ON ROADS AND BRIDGES AND IT'S A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM. AND NOW MY TIME IN THE LEGISLATURE I'D HAVE TO RUN. A LEGISLATION I HAD TO RUN A BILL FOR MEL REUSS. BUT DISTRICTS THAT RECEIVING BOND MONEY A BECAUSE IT WAS NO TRANSPARENCY HOMEOWNERS CAN FIND OUT. WHAT THE BALANCE ON THE BOND WHY THE PAYMENTS WERE GOING UP? LAW SCHOOLS WOULD REPURPOSE BONDS AND USE THEM FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD AUDIT SPECIAL DISTRICTS NOT BECAUSE OF A MOVING MONEY AROUND FOR THEIR UNINTENDED PURPOSES AND SO I THINK. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE TRANSPARENCY WHAT WHAT WAS YOUR MISSILE ACTUALLY SAID 60% A TWO THIRDS [inaudible] MEASURES PASS YES THERE'S A FEW THOUSAND TEN YEAH SO CLEARLY THE VOTERS IF YOU GIVE THEM -- SOMETHING AND EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO THEIR GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF IT BUT IT MAKES ALL OF US LOOK BAD AS GOVERNMENT. WHEN? THESE THINGS GET SPENT AND OTHER PURPOSES AND IT REALLY AROSE TRASH THE VOTER SO. I LIKE THE APPROACH OF YOU KNOW I'LL YOU KNOW GET ON THE BALLOT I'LL BE PUSHING THE LEVER IN SPORT IN -- IN NOVEMBER BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RESTORE TRUST WITH THE TAXPAYERS. AND MAKE MONEY GO WORK SUPPOSED TO GO NAY IN INTENDED PURPOSES SO THANKS AGAIN FOR BEING HERE TODAY THANK YOU. THE OTHER QUESTIONS. I HAVE A FEW -- SO WHAT IS THE YOUR INTENTION IN SPECIFYING THAT ONLY THE ACTUAL COSTS CAN BE IMPOSED FOR CHARGER IFFY. AND HOWARD LOCALS GOING TO BE ABLE TO PROVE ITS APPROVED THE BILL THE ACTUAL COST. BUT IT MANAGER THANK YOU -- THE THE BUT THAT THAT'S A CHANGE IN THE LAW FOR PROP TWENTY SIX REQUIRE REASONABLE COSTS ARE THE STANDARD THERE WAS -- IT ONLY HAD TO BE -- THAT THE STANDARD TO DETERMINE IF AS A RESULT BECAUSE IT HAD TO BE A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT IT IS REASONABLE. THAT STANDARD REALLY PROVIDED KNOWS NO STANDARD AT ALL SORT OF IN THE EYES OF THE BEHOLDER -- THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN A REQUIREMENT FOR GOVERNMENT TO SHOW. WHAT DO TO SHOW THEIR WORK -- BEFORE IT WAS A REASONABLE STATEMENT REASONABLE COST NOW THEY'RE DISCONNECT TO SHOW ACTUAL COSTS -- SO THE THEY THE GOVERNMENT HAS INFORMATION ON ON BUT THEY PUT INTO YOU KNOW PROGRAM A PROGRAMMATIC CHARGE -- THAT'S THAT'S A THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO SHOW UNDER THE INITIATIVE. BUT THE ACTUAL COSTS IS DETERMINED INCORRECTLY. I'M SORRY IF IF THE ACTUAL COSTS IS DETERMINED INCORRECTLY WELL THAT THAT WOULD. DEPEND ON WHAT WOULD HAPPEN SOUTHERN RUSSIAN -- AND THAT DEPENDS IF THERE'S A CHALLENGE TO THE TO THE TO THE CHARGE AND IT THEN IT COULD BE CORRECTED. THIS THIS IT MAKES ME NERVOUS IS INITIATIVE AND I AND I APPRECIATE WE'RE GOING WITH IT BECAUSE I THINK THIS EVERYONE HERE THAT SPONSORING THE ME ACCOUNTABLE AND WHERE IS THE MONEY GOING. I WORRY ABOUT MY RURAL COMMUNITIES AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT'S MY NUMBER ONE THING WHAT WORKS IN ONE PLACE MAY NOT WORK IN ANOTHER. AND I LOOK BACK ON THE DAYS WHEN I WAS SITTINGON THE DIET SO AS BEING A MAY HAVE A VERY SMALL TOWN. IS TWO THIRDS IS VERY DIFFICULT. AND THAT WORRIES THAT WE WE HAVE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE THINKING OF OUR SMART SMALLER COMMUNITIES I MEAN YOU KNOW I I FRET. OVER WHAT WE COULD DO TO GET SOME OF THE PROJECTS WE WOULD ONE OF GOT GOTTEN DONE -- I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE IS NOT ALWAYS INCLUDED IN SOME OF THESE THINGS SO I'M JUST A REAL FRETFUL ON IT -- AND THE OTHER ONE WAS IS THAT -- THE MEASURE. SAYS ELIMINATES THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN GENERAL AND SPECIAL TAXES. REQUIRED TO TWO THIRDS VOTER APPROVAL FOR ALL LOCAL TAXES REQUIRES A SEPARATE STATEMENT. IN A TAX ORDINANCE OF HOW FUNDS MAY BE USED. I USED IF THE GENERAL GOVERNMENT IF FOR GENERAL GOVERNMENT THE TAX MUST STATE. UNRESTRICTED GENERAL REVENUE PURPOSES THE MEASURE IS RETROACTIVE TO JANUARY ONE SO TAXES BALLOTED THIS YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SHOULDN'T CLOSE THOSE WORDS SO MANY OF THE BUT THE TAXES THAT CAME TO THIS PASSED LAST WEEK. DO WE HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THOSE AGAIN. MUCH MADAM CHAIR US SOME OF THOSE TAXES FOR EXAMPLE THE ONES IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT WAS LOTT TO REFERRED -- TO NO THE ARE ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT CITY FOR UPLAND LOOPHOLE -- ENTER DISAGREE JUST ABUSE OF PROP TWO EIGHTEEN A PROP TWENTY SIX TODAY I I THINK -- NO VOTERS HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO EXPECT A PARCEL TAXES OSMOND CASE FOR LAST TWENTY TWO YEARS WOULD BE APPROVED BY A TWO THIRDS VOTE. SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S THERE'S BY ANY REASON THAT THEY SHOULDN'T READ -- THE THE REASON THAT HAD TO BE INCLUDED IN THE MEASURE IS YOU KNOW THAT THAT THE THAT PERIOD FOR AND INITIATIVE MAJOR TO APPEAR ON THE BALLOT THIS YOU KNOW ABOUT A YEAR -- SOAKED IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THAT IS NOT A RUSH ON THE BALLOT TO TO VETO BEAT THE MEASURE TO THE PUNCH TO ENSURE THAT THESE PROVISIONS -- THE VOTERS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THIS INITIATIVE BEFORE THEY GET BOMBARDED WITH TAXES TO TRY. TO BEAT HIM TO THE FINISH LINE. THE PROVISION WAS AND INSERTED THE MEASURE THAT IS THE SAME -- THAT WAS DONE IN A PROP TWENTY SIX IT HAD A TWELVE MONTH LOOK BACK IMPROMPTU EIGHTEEN HAD A TWO YEAR LOOK BACK YOU ALL TAXES PASSING THE PRIOR TWO YEARS HAD TO CONFORM WITH PROP TWO EIGHTEEN TO THIS. PRISONERS MUCH MORE MODERATE NOT IN THAT REGARD BUT STILL DON'T FEEL LIKE IS UNDERMINING THE WILL OF THE VOTERS. IT'S PAST YEAR SO MADAM CHAIR IN TERMS OF THE CONSISTENCY OF THE APPROACH WHEN IT COMES TO THESE WE WE LOOK TO BE CONSISTENT. AS AS WAS TORNADO JUST STATED. SO IT WAS NOT WITH ANY INTENT TO UNDERMINE THE WILL OF THE VOTERS MOST IMPORTANT WHEN YOU LOOK AT SAN FRANCISCO EXPECT THERE'S GOING TO BE COURT CHALLENGES. ON THOSE PROVISIONS -- WHICH ARE GOING TO BE A WHOLE DIFFERENT DEBATE -- THAN WHAT WE HAVE TRIED TO INCLUDE AS WE ACTUALLY WERE TRYING TO BE TRANSPARENT. WE ARE TRYING TO BE FAIR AND WE ARE TRYING TO BE BALLOTS. THAT WAS OUR INTENT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YEAH WELL NOW THAT WE'VE HAD THE FRONT PROPONENTS I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME THE OPPONENTS PANEL UP BLOOM. A I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME MAYOR SACRAMENTO MR DEL STEINBERG. MR DISTINCT CHARACTER.

THAT. IT CARRIES BALANCE BETWEEN STATE AUTHORITY LOCAL CONTROL. AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND IN RESPECT OF THE IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES IN THE DEBATE WHICH PLAYED OUT HERE -- ON THE DAIS IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES ABOUT WHETHER WE ARE OVERTAXED. OR DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES BRIBE PUBLIC SERVICES THAT PEOPLE DEMAND. BUT I MUST TELL YOU I'M ANGRY ABOUT THIS INITIATIVE. AND AND I'M ANGRY ABOUT IT BECAUSE AS A NEW MAYOR. WHO'S ACTUALLY TRYING TO RAISE SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC CAPITAL TO GROW. MY CITY'S ECONOMY. IN MY VIEW THIS IN IT INITIATIVE IS BOTH DISINGENUOUS AND A GROSS OVER REACH. AND SO LET'S TELL IT LIKE IT IS HERE HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. THAT UP A DECISION THAT WAS REFERRED TO A COUPLE OF TIMES CREATED SOME AMBIGUITY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. I INDUSTRY SPECIFIC TAXES COULD BE PAST. BOB BY A MAJORITY VOTE -- BEFORE. ABOUT A BODY OF LOCAL VOTERS. AND SO RATHER THAN TRYING TO FIX A SMALL PROBLEM. WHAT THE INITIATIVE PROPONENTS HAVE DONE HERE IS TO TRY TO DRIVE AYE AN IDEOLOGICAL MACK TRUCK? THROUGH AN OPENING. TO REALLY UPHOLD THEIR IDEOLOGICAL VIEW OF THE WORLD AND IT'S MOST UNFORTUNATE. IF THE ARGUMENT IS THAT NO INDUSTRY SPECIFIC TAX. SHOULD BE PASSED ON A MAJORITY VOTE. OKAY FOR THIS IS SUPPORTED STRONGLY BY THREE INDUSTRIES THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY THE ALCOHOL INDUSTRY. AND THE OIL INDUSTRY IF THAT'S THE ARGUMENT. I COULD ACTUALLY NOT ONLY RESPECTED I MIGHT STAND BEHIND IT ESPECIALLY IF IT WERE A COMPROMISE. JUXTAPOSED TO WHAT THIS IS THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'VE DONE. THEY HAVE WIDENED THEIR GRAFT GRASP TO SAY THAT EVEN IF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WANTS TO RAISE A SALES TAX. WHICH A TRIED AND TRUE WAY. TRYING TO RAISE REVENUE FOR CITY THAT IT NOW WILL REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS VOTE WHAT A DAMAGING OVERREACH WHAT AN ABUSE OF AUTHORITY ACTUALLY AND I RESPECT THE INITIATIVE PROCESS I ALSO DID THE INITIATIVE REFORM. THAT WOULD GIVE THIS LEGISLATURE THE NEXT TWENTY OR THIRTY DAYS OR SO. TO WRITE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AND SUBSTITUTE IT POTENTIALLY FOR WHAT'S ON THE BALLOT WITH THEIR WITH THEIR CONCURRENCE OF THE INITIAL BROWN'S HAVE TALKED TO THEM NUMBER TIMES ARE NOT INTERESTED. BECAUSE THIS IS IDEOLOGICAL. AND I'M NOT IDEOLOGICAL NEVER HAVE BEEN AYE BUT A STRONG. DEMOCRAT APPEAR I WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS AND WE DID EVERYONE I'M REALLY UPSET ABOUT THIS. BECAUSE THE WORST THING THAT BUT INITIATIVE PROPONENT NO MATTER WHAT SIDE OF THE FENCE THEY COME% FROM. IS TO TAKE A SPECIFIC PROBLEM. INSTEAD OF SEEKING JUST TO SOLVE IT. TO GO SO OVER BROAD. THAT IT HAS REAL CONSEQUENCES WHO ARE TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING? AGAIN I GOT WE PASS MEASURE YOU IN -- TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN IN. SACRAMENTO WE GOT LESS THAN TWO THIRDS BUT WELL OVER A MAJORITY. IT WAS IN THE MID SIXTIES. NOW WE WANT TO GO BACK NOW ONLY WE KNEW WHAT WE WANT TO EXPAND IT SO THAT WE CAN INVEST DIRECTLY IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. DO I THINK WE MIGHT GET A TWO THIRDS YOU BETTER BELIEVE A SPECIAL WITH THE THREAT OF THIS THING. THAT WE'RE GONNA TRY. BUT IF WE DON'T. AND WE GET 6465% WE'RE GONNA HAVE A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR HOLE IN OUR BUDGET AND YOU BETTER BELIEVE THAT'S GOING TO RESULT IN PINK SLIPS FOR FIREFIGHTERS AND COPS. AND ALL THE OTHER THINGS YOU GUYS CARE ABOUT. ITS I JUST GONNA CALL IT LIKE IT IS AND I GUESS MY URGING TO YOU AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THIS CONSISTENT. NECESSARILY WITH THE OPPOSITION CAMPAIGN BUT I'M JUST SPEAKING FOR MYSELF. I WOULD URGE YOU TO TAKE THE NEXT TWENTY DAYS AND STEP IN. AND TRY TO SCALE THIS THING BACK IN A WAY THAT GAVE THEM THE WHEN THEY WON WHAT DO TWO THIRDS VOTE FOR INDUSTRY SPECIFIC TAXES AND SAY THAT. REGARDLESS WHETHER IT'S FOR GENERAL PURPOSES OR FOR SPECIFIC PURPOSES TWO THIRDS I'M NOT SPEAKING FOR THESE GUYS. THESE GENTLEMEN HERE AYE AYE. NO I COULD I COULD LIVE WITH THAT YOU TAKE THE SALES TAX AWAY FROM US YOU TAKE THE OTHER ABILITY TO RAISE. GENERAL PURPOSE TAXES TO BE ABLE TO STRENGTHEN OUR CITIES THAT'S JUST PLAIN WRONG. IT'S GOING TO HAVE REAL CONSEQUENCES SO [inaudible] I RESPECT THE IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCE IN THE BUILDING THAT'S WHAT CALIFORNIA'S FINE. SOLVE YOUR PROBLEM. DON'T TAKE OUT YOUR BROAD IDEOLOGY ON THE REST OF US WHO ARE TRYING TO BUILD MODERN ECONOMIES. AND INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN OUR CITIES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TO SWING NEXT MET -- I'LL. I HAVE A FRIEND THE WHERE WITH ALL TO FOLLOW THE MAYOR -- THANK YOU MADAM MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS TERRY BRENNAN BEHALF SERVICE EMPLOYEES INTERNATIONAL UNION. WE REPRESENT. SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND TAXPAYING HARDWORKING PUBLIC EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS IN CALIFORNIA. ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OF THEM WORK IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT SPECIAL DISTRICT CITY -- COUNTY EMPLOYEES ALL THE WAY DOWN A MOSQUITO ABATEMENT TAT EMPLOYEES -- ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OF THEM THERE IT AND THE HOUSE CARE INDUSTRY AND THAT'S ONE OF THINGS THAT ONE DAY AND ON MUCH OF THIS REVENUE IS USED IN THE COUNTY. AND LOCAL SERVICES. THAT IT'S AT JEOPARDY HERE -- BASICALLY COMBATING SOME OF THE IMPACTS. OF THE FUNDERS OF THIS INITIATIVE -- MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT THIS IS NOT A TAXPAYER REVOLT. 80% THE MONEY RUNNING THROUGH MISTER LAPSED LEASE COMMITTEE IS COMING FROM THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY. SOME OF IT'S COMING FROM THE WINE INDUSTRY AND A FEW OTHERS LIKE TOBACCO AND AND ALCOHOL BUT THE BULK OF ITS COMING FROM THE SONY INDUSTRY -- THIS IS A THINLY DISGUISED -- EFFORT BY THEM TO THWART LOCAL EFFORTS. TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF THEIR BEHAVIOR ON OUR COMMUNITIES. TO SUGGEST THAT. THIS IS -- IDEA I'VE BEEN SORT OF INCREDULOUS TO SUGGEST THAT THIS IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY IN THERE. FUNNELING CAMPAIGN DONATIONS THROUGH THE BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE AND PRETENDING LIKE IT'S A TAXPAYER REVOLT IS SPEED COMICAL AT BEST IF NOT JUST [inaudible] DISINGENUOUS -- MUCH OF THE THAT TAX IS APPLIED IN FEES REYES ARE USED TO COMBAT. THE ILLS OF THESE INDUSTRIES LIKE OBESITY DIABETES POLLUTION TOBACCO RELATED DISEASES ALL OF THIS WILL BE MUCH HARDER. IT RAISING COMBAT FOR THAT REASON WHERE STRONGLY OPPOSED THINK RESTORING. I THINK YOU ARE UNABLE CHAIR IN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE DID ACCURATE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CITY SOME ALSO STEP IN TODAY FOR MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES SUZANNE AND ABLE TO BE HERE TODAY. BUT SAID THE LEAGUE IN C. SOCK OR ARE STRONGLY UNITED IN OR OPPOSITION TO IT TO THIS MEASURE WHICH IS WE VIEWED AS A DEVASTATING ATTACK ON THE ABILITY OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES DELIVER SERVICES TO TO THEIR RESIDENTS. A MERE STEINBERG MANY GREAT CASE ABOUT HOW THIS MEASURE COULD IMPACT -- THE PRIORITIES OF THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO AND TO AS WAS TOUCHED ON A LITTLE BIT EARLIER A COUNTIES ARE OF COURSE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THIS A IMPACTS SOME OF THE SAFETY NET SERVICES THEY DELIVER. WHETHER IT'S HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH LAW ENFORCEMENT OTHER OTHER A CRITICAL SERVICES. NOW WE HEARD THE PROPONENTS EARLIER TALK ABOUT HOW THE IMPORTANCE THE VOTERS AND I ALSO HEARD THEM SAY DOESN'T HAVE ANY IMPACT ON ON LOCAL REVENUES OR CITY REVENUES. WILL JUST LAST TUESDAY AS I THINK THE CHAIR TOUCHED ON VOTERS WENT TO THE POLLS IN APPROVED TWENTY FIVE LOCAL BALLOT MEASURES IS WORTH MAJORITY VOTES THAT THE THAT THE VOTERS WHEN AND THEIR IN INTO THE APPROVED IT ALL OF THESE MEASURES ALL OF THEM. ARE GONNA BE UNDONE -- BY IN HIGH END HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A A IN TERMS OF COMMITTEE INVESTMENTS ARE GONNA BE UNDONE -- BY THIS MEASURES RETROACTIVE PROVISIONS ON IN TERMS OF A LOSS UP BEYOND ALL THE WORK THAT HAS TO BE DONE IN TERMS OF PREPARING AND PUTTING MEASURES ON THE BALLOTS IN CONDUCTING ELECTIONS AND ALL THAT. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS -- IN IN LOCAL VOTER APPROVED TAXES THAT THAT CAN BE WIPED OUT AND AS WE ALL KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE MANY MORE A MEASURES ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND MANY OF THOSE WILL. BE IMPACTED AS WELL A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF IT IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY THAT WERE TO TAXES A ONE WAS A HOTEL TAX -- ONE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS PASSED BY MID MAJORITY DIDN'T QUITE GET TWO THIRDS BUT THAT THAT'S UNDONE A CANNABIS TAX IS A LOT OF INTEREST IN THIS BUILDING AND IN CANNABIS IS THAT. THAT INDUSTRY ARE A TAKES HOLD IN CALIFORNIA -- THERE WAS A CHAMPION OF COUNTY HAVE A CANNABIS TAX WITH ABOUT THREE POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR THAT'S UNDONE IN THE CITY OF RIALTO WHICH I THINK IS PRETTY CLOSE TO THE CITY OF SAN BERNIE DINO -- THEY PASSED A WITH THE 60% -- APPROVAL -- A THAT'S ABOUT FOURTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ABOUT UNDONE. SO ON IS SO EVEN IF SOME OF THESE MEASURES THAT THAT ARE ON BETTER ON THE BALLOT NOVEMBER EVEN IF THEY GET A TWO THIRDS MAJORITY. THEY GOTTA WATCH IT BECAUSE THERE'S SOME LANGUAGE IN THE BALLOT MEASURE IF YOU DON'T WRITE YOUR BALLOT MEASURE EXACTLY AS THEY THE ATTORNEYS HAVE DROPPED IT THE CAN BE UNDONE EVEN IF YOU GET A TWO THIRDS. ARM IN THAT I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK IN THE IN THIS BUILDING A LAST COUPLE YEARS ABOUT NIMBIS AND AND AND HOW THEY CAN KIND OF FRUSTRATE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT OTHER. OTHER DEVELOPMENT -- WATCH WHAT THEY CAN DO WITH THE FEE PROVISIONS IN THIS MATTER -- YOU FIRST OF ALL IT THERE'S ABOUT FOUR HOOPS AND HURDLES YOU AFTER A GO THROUGH NOW TO ADOPT A FEE AND AND BASICALLY WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO MEAN IS YOU'RE NOT COULD BE OVER COVER YOUR FULL COST OF OF HUB DELIVERING THE SERVICE SO YOU EITHER HAVE TO SHIFT. THE BURDEN ON LOCAL TAXPAYER UP OR OR I OR CUT THE SERVICE THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUT BEYOND THAT YOU HAVE FOR AVERAGE CITY COUNCIL OR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FIVE MEMBERS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FOUR FOUR OUT OF FIVE MEMBERS ACTUALLY HAVE TO VOTE FOR THE FEE NUMBER. ONE AND THEN TO THIS IS WHERE THE NAVY'S COMING AND ONLY 5% OF THE VOTERS IS A NEW REFERENDUM PROVISION IN HERE 5% OF THE VOTERS CONSIGNED TO SIGN A PETITION AND BASICALLY FUND UNDO THE MEASURE AND FORCE A VOTE BASICALLY FREEZE THE FEE AND FORCE A VOTE I THINK THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF OUR DISRUPTION THAT WILL BE BECAUSE WITH WITH THAT PROVISION. WELL IT'S REALLY CLEAR IS THE MERE TOUCHED ON THIS OBVIOUSLY THIS THIS MEASURE OBVIOUSLY FAVORS THE INTERESTS OF THE CORPORATIONS IS WERE SPONSORED IT. ABOUT WE THINK IT IS A VAST AND HARMFUL OVER REACH IT'S GONNA DRASTICALLY UNDERMINE THE ABILITY OF OUR CITIES COUNTIES SPECIAL DISTRICTS WHO I WOULD ARGUE ALREADY OR OF LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT THAT IS EXTREMELY ACCOUNTABLE -- TO THE PUBLIC A DELIVER -- HOST SERVICES TO OUR RESIDENTS AND FOR THOSE REASONS ARE OF SEE BOTH ON BEHALF OF THE CITIES OF THE STATE AS WELL AS THE COUNTIES BUT WE STRONGLY OPPOSES MEASURING THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. THIS SUMMER LACKEY EFFORT MAYOR STEINBERG. VOICE IN THIS SUB DISINTERESTED WOULD HELP ENSURE YOUR VISION. FOR THE CITY'S PROPOSED TAX INCREASE WILL CONTINUE AFTER YOU LEAVE OFFICE. OF COURSE I PLAN TO BE AROUND FOR AWHILE -- EVER HIT. WELL I'LL BE HONEST SO HERE'S WHO WE WANT TO DO I MEAN THE FIRST ALL WANNA DO A GENERAL TAX I CANNOT BE SPECIFIC ABOUT HOW WE WOULD SPEND THE MONEY BUT FOR EXAMPLE I HAVE A VISION. WHERE WE WOULD TAKE A QUARTER SAID AGAIN SUBJECT TO TH DISCRETION OF THE COUNCIL -- WITHOUT ANY PROMISES AHEAD OF TIME. WHERE WE WOULD SECURITIZED? ONE QUARTER CENT IN CREATED CAPITAL FUND. A FOUR TO FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO ACTUALLY INVEST IN JOB CREATION MY CITY WHERE GOVERNMENT TOWN. ARE LEAST KNOWN AS ONE BUT WERE RAPIDLY SEEKING TO CHANGE THAT TO DIVERSIFY OUR ECONOMY. AND WE LACK CAPITAL. AND I WANT PUBLIC CAPITAL SO ACTUALLY IF I HAVE MY WAY I WOULD TIE UP. A BUNCH OF THE MONEY SO THAT IT COULD BE SPENT ON THE DIRECT SERVICES ARE THE PENSIONS ARE THE OTHER THINGS THAT. I KNOW YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT BUT WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT. OF COURSE WITH THIS TWO THIRDS TO ACTUAL. IN THIS ENVIRONMENT IS THAT -- WILL WE'RE GONNA GET STRONG MAJORITY. WE END UP WITH 6263% NOT ONLY CAN'T I REALIZE THAT VISION OF MORE CAPITAL. WHICH IS A BUSINESS PROPOSITION IN MY CITY. BUT ALSO THEN I'M GONNA HAVE TO CUT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF WITH THOSE BASIC SERVICES AND SINCE MOST OF THE BUDGET OF COURSE MY CITY AND OTHER CITIES IS PUBLIC SAFETY. IT'S GONNA BE POLICE AND FIRE THAT'S WHY I'M UPSET ABOUT THIS BECAUSE IT'S A GROSS OVER REACH YOU COULD HAVE. PROPONENTS COULD HAVE DEALT WITH THE INDUSTRY SPECIFIC TAXES. AND YOU KNOW THAT. MY FRIEND HERE MIGHT STILL POSE I MIGHT EVEN OPPOSE IT BY TELL YOU THIS I WOULDN'T BE IN THIS ROOM HERE. I I WOULDN'T I GOT YOU KNOW IS WHEN. IT IS WHAT IT IS THAT'S A FIX OKAY. AGREE OR DISAGREE. THIS IS NOT NECESSARY. WHY ME GOT IMPOSED A TWO THIRDS VOTE ON SALES TAXES FOR FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES WHY? THAT YOU SECURITY ILLOGICAL. AND THAT STANDS IN THE WAY OF OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE PRO BUSINESS MAYORS HAVE PRO BUSINESS AGENDAS. WHO WANT -- TO RAISE A TAX TO HELP CREATE CAPITAL TO BE ABLE TO DO MORE JOB CREATION IN OUR CITY. I UNDERSTAND THEM COMPROMISE IN WHAT HAPPENS IN IN THE BUILDING AND WHAT HAPPENS EVEN WITH INITIATIVES YOU GOT A CHANCE TO YOU KNOW. SO I KNOW THIS IS -- HEARING IT'S REQUIRED BY LAW. AGAIN UNDER INITIATIVE REFORM TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY THERE. TO WITHDRAWN INITIATIVE LATER IN THE GAME I KNOW THEY HAVE NO INTENT TO DOING SO BECAUSE THEY'RE BENT ON AN IDEOLOGICAL AGENDA I JUST NOT HAPPY ABOUT IT. AND YOU KNOW LUCKILY WE'VE GOT FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS HERE WHO ARE GOING TO POINT OUT JUST WHAT THESE GENTLEMEN SAID THAT. YOU CAN'T HAVE A COUPLE OF INDUSTRIES. ESSENTIALLY REMOVED THE ABILITY OF ALL CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO DEFINE THEIR OWN DESTINY AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. GOT A PRO BUSINESS MAYOR. THIS THIS HINDERS ME AND LIMITS MY ABILITY. TO GROW MY MY CITY'S ECONOMY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- MAYOR STEINBERG LIKE YOU THIS JUST MAKES ME ANGRY HAS A AS A FORMER MAYOR -- OF THE CITY THAT HAS CONSISTENTLY TRIED TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND WHOSE VOTERS HAVE CONSISTENTLY VOTED -- TO I INCREASE FEES OUT WHEN THEY'VE BEEN ASKED. TO AND HAVE DONE IT BY SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITIES AND AT MADAM CHAIR YOU ASKED A QUESTION OF THE PROPONENTS EARLIER ABOUT DOESN'T DISTORT THE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE YOU BET IT DOES. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT'S INTENDED TO DO IT WANTS TO BLOCK THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. AND WHAT KIND OF A DEMOCRACY DO WE LIVE AND WHERE WE ARE TRYING TO INSTITUTIONALIZE THAT AND INSTITUTIONALIZE IT AT THE INSTANCE OF A FEW CORPORATIONS THAT WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN OUT. OF YOU KNOW WHY IS THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY SO INTERESTED IN THE SENATE -- ISSUE AND PUT UP 80% OF THE MONEY SO FAR THAT WE KNOW ABOUT IF -- I UNDERSTAND THE STATISTIC CORRECTLY WELL THERE'S FOUR CITIES OUT OF ALL THE CITIES IN CALIFORNIA FOR CITIES HAVE VOTED TO IMPLEMENT. A FEE ON SODA. NOW WHY HAVE THEY DONE THAT. THEY DID THAT IN FURTHERANCE OF WHAT IS THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF THEIR CITIZENS BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THE CITY COUNCIL JUST AT IT. THIS IS A VOTE OF THE PEOPLE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT PASSED BY SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY TO PASS BY TWO THIRDS NO [inaudible] AND VATS WHY. THE BEVERAGE COMPANIES ARE SPENDING THAT KIND OF UNDER GODLY AMOUNTS OF MONEY THAT THEY'RE SPENDING IN ORDER TO QUALIFY THIS AND THEY'LL BE DOING THAT. TO PUSH IT THROUGH TWO NOW LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS IN ONE COMMUNITY AND I I THINK MOST EVERYBODY HERE KNOWS THAT. I YOU KNOW A AND A PICKLE LONG WITH THAT MAYOR STEINBERG AT WAS A PROPONENT OF OF THE HELPING. TO RAISE REVENUE TO COMBAT -- DE ID THIS -- THE EPIDEMIC OF DIABETES AND HEART DISEASE THAT'S AFFECTING OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT IN BERKELEY THAT THAT FEES RAISED ONE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S BEING USED TO ADDRESS CHILD NUTRITION AND COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS. NOW. YOU KNOW WE KNOW THE TAXES AND FEES FOR DECADES HAVE BEEN INEFFECTIVE PUBLIC HEALTH TOOL. OUT WE SEEN THEM WORK WITH TOBACCO AND NOW WE'RE SEEING IT AS A AS I JUST MENTIONED IT'S WORKING WITH SODA BUT SINCE. NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT LET'S LET'S JUST THINK ABOUT THIS ADULT SMOKING HAS DECLINED OVER AND WE CAN CURRENT CREDIT I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY DOUBT ABOUT THIS AND IT'S BEEN STUDIED. WE CAN CREDIT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THAT IMPACT TO THE TOBACCO TAXES THAT CALIFORNIA'S HAVE BEEN PASSING SINCE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. AND THOSE WERE STATEWIDE MEASURE SO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE BUT I'D LIKE US ALL TO IMAGINE A SCENARIO WHERE THOSE TAXES WOULD HAVE REQUIRED. A TWO THIRDS MAJORITY AND NEVER PASSED WHERE WOULD WE BE TODAY ON THE ISSUE OF SMOKING. IF WE HAD NOT HAD THAT REVENUE AND THE ABILITY TO SPEND THAT MONEY TO ADDRESS A DIFFERENT PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN. SO WE'VE GOT THESE FOUR CITIES NOW. I AND I IN IN BERKELEY. SUGAR SWEETENED BEVERAGE SALES HAVE DROPPED BY 10% BUT WATER IS GOING UP BY 16% FOLKS. PEOPLE ARE STILL BUYING BEVERAGES. ANOTHER STUDY SHOWED THAT OF THE SUGARY BEVERAGE CONSUMPTION DECREASED BY 21% IN BERKELEY'S LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS AND LET THAT'S A REMINDER. THAT THE EPIDEMIC OF DIABETES AND HEART DISEASE AFFECTS LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE. PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE MORE AFFECTED BY THIS EPIDEMIC. SO FEES A BIT AND IT A POWERFUL TOOL JUST AS THE TOBACCO TAXES BEEN NOT JUST FOR CHANGING BEHAVIOR BUT FOR GENERATING. THE KINDS OF REVENUE IT TAKES. TO A A CREATE PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT. OUR COMMUNITIES I HEARD A LOT ABOUT ABOUT YOU KNOW TRANSPARENCY -- AND ACCOUNTABILITY WELL WHAT ABOUT THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WE ARE SWORN TO PROTECT AS ELECTED OFFICIALS SO. I I WANT TO THANK ALL THREE OF YOU FOR MAKING YOUR PRESENTATIONS HERE TODAY THIS IS AN ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT ISSUE. AND I YOU KNOW OF BE THERE WITH YOU FIGHT IT TOOTH AND NAIL A FOR IF IT HASN'T CHANGED AND A OF A WHEN WE SEE IT IN THE A IN THE UPCOMING ELECTION. THANK YOU -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR BUT GENERALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND SORT OF ASKING SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON WHAT KIND OF PAINT A PICTURE AND THE MAYOR STEINBERG I'M KINDA LIKE YOU FROM THE CONSERVATIVE DISTRICT BUT I COME UP AND I WORK WITH EVERYBODY AND TRY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS [inaudible] SO -- AND I UNDERSTAND THE MAJORITY PARTY WE HAVE FOR ENORMOUS ITEMS TO TAKE UP MOST OF OUR BUDGET SO WE ALWAYS NEED TO FIND NEW REVENUE. AND I TRIED TO DO THAT WE TRY TO DO THAT MY FIRST YEAR I DID A AN AMNESTY WE HAD DONE IT SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOR THE THREE TAX AGENCIES ARE SET NOT TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS. EASY MONEY OFF THE TABLE TO GET IT AND TRIED TO GET IN ORDER TO STAY BUILDINGS WORK REALTORS GET TENANTS IN THERE ARE KNOWN ORANGE COUNTY WE HAVE LIKE LAST. STERN 2% OCCUPANCY RATE SO BUT THAT'S WHAT I'VE TRIED TO DO TO COME UP IT IN SACRAMENTO -- BUT THE OTHER THING THAT THAT FRUSTRATES ME IS. ISSUES COME UP LIKE THE HOUSING CRISIS NOBODY GOES DOWN. AND ASK THE QUESTION WHY DO WE HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS IN THE PART OF IT IS. DEVELOPER IMPACT FEES LUMBER TAXES CAP AND TRADE THAT COST CONCRETE AND STUCCO PRICES TO GO UP NOW P. YOU SEE PUT SOLAR MANDATE ON NEW HOMES IT'S ACTUALLY EXPENSIVE JUST TO BUILD A HOUSE [inaudible] AND I THINK PEOPLE ARE HURTING. I MEAN WE JUST SAW AN ORANGE COUNTY SENATOR WAS REMOVED FROM OFFICE FOR A FOR A TAX VOTE -- ALL THESE THINGS ADD UP ADD UP ADD UP TO THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA. AND AS I MENTIONED ONE I SPOKE TO THE SUPPORTERS JUST WHAT JUMPED OUT AT ME IS THE AND THE ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT'S INCREASED THE LOCALITY SINCE. TWO THOUSAND TEN AND IT IN MY OPINION. ITS OF A LOT OF TIMES IT'S A PRIOR IS NOT A REVENUE PROBLEM LIKE HEARING IN SACRAMENTO SOUGHT A REVENUE PROBLEM IT'S BEEN A SPENDING PROBLEM SO. I I JUST THINK CALIFORNIANS ARE YOU NO NICKEL AND DIME TO DEATH AND YOU KNOW. WE GOT TO GIVE ME A BREAK AT SOME POINT. IF I MAY. MAY JUST. SO I JUST THINK THAT THEY RESPECT YOUR POINT OF VIEW OF COURSE AND I I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING A STATE LEGISLATOR. AND VOTING -- TO OPPOSE -- OR SUPPORT ANY REVENUE OR TAX MEASURE. VERSUS TAKING AWAY THE ABILITY OF LOCAL [inaudible] GOVERNMENT. TO BE AND LOCAL VOTERS TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN FUTURES WHY CAN'T THEY MAKE THAT DECISION. RIGHT I THINK THAT'S REALLY IT THERE IT COULD BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IDEOLOGICALLY I KNOW WE WE MIGHT NOT EVER AGREE ON WHETHER. THE STATE OVERTAXED VERSES UNDER RESOURCE THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S WHY WE YOU KNOW HAVE THE PARTIES AND WHY WE HAVE THE THAT THE DEBATES THE ELECTIONS IN THE ARGUMENTS. BUT THERE'S A DIFFERENT IDEOLOGICAL ISSUE THAT I I FEEL LIKE THE PROPONENTS. AGAIN ARE BEING A BIT HYPOCRITICAL. AND THAT IS IF GOVERNMENT IS TO TALK DOWN HERE FROM THE STATE LEVEL. WHILE YOU TAKE AWAY THE ABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DETERMINE THEIR OWN DESTINY OF THE VOTERS ONE IT. THEN THE VOTERS WANT IT. IF THEY DON'T WANT IT THEY DON'T WANT YOUR COMMUNITY MIGHT SAY YES. OR KNOW MY COMMUNITY MIGHT SAY YES OR NO. AND LOCAL CONTROL IS BEEN SUCH AN IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE OF YOUR PARTY AND AND YOUR PHILOSOPHY AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THAT. IT'S KIND OF EASILY GETS IGNORED. YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE VOTERS -- IN YOUR CITY AN ORANGE GET WIT AND WHICH WOULD CITY BUT IN ORANGE COUNTYDON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. MY SACRAMENTO SALES TAX TO BUILD. MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMY. SO WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THAT TOOL AWAY FROM MY VOTERS [inaudible] THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE PART THAT I THINK IS [inaudible] INCONSISTENT HERE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS MISTER OSAMA REALIZING CLARIFYING COMMENT. WHY IS IT? WHEN YOU WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOUR PUBLIC WANTS TO DO SOMETHING WHY IS TWO THIRDS [inaudible] SITTARD. THE DOOR SHUT. ITS NOT A DOOR SHUT BUT IT SAID DOOR THAT IS -- AT LEAST HALFWAY CLOSE BECAUSE U. CAN THWART THEM AT THE WILL OF A VERY STRONG MAJORITY I'M TELLING YOU IN TWO THOUSAND AND THIRTEEN OUR MAJOR YOU SALES TAX NOT IN INDUSTRY SPECIFIC TAX GOD I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER SIXTY TWO OR 63%. THAT WOULD BE A FIVE QUOTE FAILURE UNDER THIS INITIATIVE I WOULD MAYBE WE DISAGREE BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT SHOULDN'T BE A FAILURE. THAT SHOULD BE A SIGNAL FORWARD TO THE VOTERS WANT TO INVEST IN. IN THEIR COMMUNITIES IN THE VARIOUS WAYS THAT THERE MAYOR LAYS OUT IN THE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN MY HOPE NEXT ELECTION. TO SPENDING THE MONEY EXACTLY HOW I PROMISED WHEN I WHEN I CAMPAIGN FOR IT. SO I DO THINK THAT SAID IT IF IT'S NOT A DOOR SHUT. IT'S A DOOR A BARELY AJAR. CLINCHER FIGHT IT OUT ON DO THAT I MEAN THERE'S ALREADY A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RULES THAT APPLY TO THE STATE AND AND IT'S A REVENUE OUR ABILITY -- IT YOU KNOW IT AS YOU KNOW IN THIS BUILDING TO RAISE THE TAXES TWO THIRDS OF THE BODY AND A GOVERNOR SIGNATURE THERE ISN'T REQUIREMENT THEIR HOUSE TO GO TO THE BALLOT. A IF THIS BODY PUTS A HOUSING BOND APART BONTA  <u><c.green>SOMETHING</c></u> ON THE BALLOT IT'S A MAJORITY VOTE OF THE STATE'S VOTERS OUT WHEN WE GO TO THE BALLOT ALREADY EVERY TAX EVERY SINGLE TAX A LOCAL GOVERNMENT DOES TODAY HOUSE TO BE APPROVED BY THE VOTERS. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN. AND IT IS I THINK IT'S ALREADY BEEN TOUCHED ON WORKSTREAM ACCOUNTABLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT'S IT MAY BE A YES SIR ARE LEGISLATORS OCCASIONALLY THAT THAT LEAVE OFFICE OFTENTIMES IF A LOCAL OUR ELECTED GET OUT OF STEP WITH THEIR ELECTORATE. THERE QUICKLY REMOVED FROM OFFICE SO I MEAN WE'RE ALREADY ACCOUNTABLE AND THIS HURDLE THE TWO THIRDS IS REALLY GOING TO DEVASTATE CITIES AND COUNTIES GOING FORWARD AND ALSO MAKE THEM MORE ARE COMING UP TO SACRAMENTO LOOKING FOR A FOR RESOURCES BECAUSE OF THEIR OWN ABILITY TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN. NEEDS. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ASSEMBLYMAN BLOOM FORMAT ONE QUICK COMMENT AND THAT IS SO. I DON'T THINK THE PROPONENTS OF THIS MEASURE WOULD ACCEPT TWO THIRDS SIR. A REQUIREMENT FOR THEIR MEASURE AND THERE'S A REASON THAT THEY WOULDN'T ACCEPT THAT IT'S BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T PASS UP. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS ALL THREE OF YOU AND I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY THAT'S BEEN HERE MY CONCERN AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IS I THINK OF THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I THINK OF THE RULE IN SMALLER CITIES AND I AM I I WANT TO ALWAYS SAY. I WOULD SAY TO MYSELF DON'T FORGET WHERE YOU CAME FROM AND I CAME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND I'VE SEEN RIVER SITTING AT THE DYESS MANY TIMES THINKING WHY DON'T THESE HAIR BRAINED THINGS COME UP FROM THE STATE AND NOT. REALLY REALIZE WHAT'S HAPPENING IN MY CITY MY VOTERS WANT TO VOTE ON THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THEM. SO I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF ALL YOU OF ALL MADE TODAY -- I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS WILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT IF WE'D LIKE A PUBLIC COMMENT IN THOSE THAT WOULD LIKE TO COME OUT EVEN TO HEAR MEMBER. COMMITTEE I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU FOR COMING TODAY AND I THINK. SO YOU STEP UP THE MICROPHONE SAY YOUR NAME IN THE ORGANIZED ORGANIZATION YOUR REPRESENT AND LIMITED TO ONE MINUTE PER PERSON WHEREVER YOU LIKE SITS ANYTHING [inaudible] ONE OF OKAY HERE. THIRTY MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AYE GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WOLFE THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OF THE TAXPAYER PROTECTION ACT AND THANKS FOR LETTING SAID HERE TODAY -- MEMBERS BENJAMIN FRANKLIN ONCE SAID DEMOCRACY IS TWO WOLVES AND A SHEEP DECIDING WHAT'S FOR DINNER. INCREASINGLY THE TAXPAYERS ARE THE SHEEP AND THEY DESERVE TO BE PROTECTED. A TWO THIRDS THRESHOLD ACCOMPLISHES THAT ESPECIALLY PROGRESSIVE EXACTIONS LIKE SALES TAXES THAT IMPACT PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME PEOPLE. MEMBERS I WANT TO STRESS AGAIN THAT THIS IS NOT AN IMPOSSIBLE CRUSH HOLD TO HIT. 70% OF EDUCATION PARCEL PAXIL SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE HAVE INDEED PASSED WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE. MEMBERS WHAT KICKED ELVIS OFF% PROPOSITION THIRTEEN KICKED US OFF FORTY YEARS AGO THIS MONTH. OKAY VOTERS APPROVED OF THAT LANDMARK CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WITH 64% SUPPORT IT REMAINS OVER 60% TODAY IN POPULARITY AND I THINK THAT SPEAKS. JUST HOW MUCH VOTERS VALUE THE TWO THIRDS VOTE PROTECTION. MEMBERS IN CLOSING AND TO BE CLEAR. OUR JOB IS TO RESPOND TO THE WILL OF THE TAXPAYERS. VOTERS HAVE AMENDED THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION THREE TIMES OVER THE LAST THIRTY YEARS AS MISTER ANNATTO MENTION PROP SIXTY TWO PROP TWO EIGHTEEN PROP. TWENTY SIX TO UNDENIABLY STATE POLLING. NUMBER ONE THAT THEY WILL PROTECT PROPOSITION. THIRTEEN NUMBER TWO THAT THEY WANT TO VOTE ON TAX INCREASES AND BENEFIT ASSESSMENTS. AND NUMBER THREE THAT THEY WILL RESPOND TO WHAT THEY PERCEIVE TO BE OVERREACH BY THE JUDICIAL I AM EACH. AND THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT THE MEASURE THINKING MADAM CHAIR. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISTY VELMA A BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS HERE TO MAKE A FEW COMMENTS IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE -- THIS IS A BIT OF A SCAM OR A TRICK I THIS IS A A MEASURE SPONSORED NOT BY THE PEOPLE BUT AS WAS MENTIONED THIS HEARING SOME VERY WELL. FINANCED A INDUSTRIES THAT ARE OF FRUSTRATED BY THEIR EXPERIENCES AT THE LOCAL BALLOT. UP SO THOSE OF THE TAXPAYERS THAT THIS MEASURE SEEKS TO PROTECT AND I GUESS OFFER THEM SOME LEVEL OF THEIR VIEW OF FAIRNESS AND TRANSPARENCY. BUT I WOULD ARGUE THAT. THEY NEED TO SEEK. THE ENHANCEMENT OF THEIR BOTTOM LINES AND IT'S NOT THEIR JOB NECESSARILY TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT HOW. WHAT THEY'RE DOING IMPACTS OUR COMMUNITIES ITS GOVERNMENTS JOB TO GOVERN AND REGULATE AND INTERVENE IN PROTECTION OF CALIFORNIANS AND IN CITIES AND COUNTIES IN DISTRICTS THAT THEIR TAX PAYERS [inaudible] SO. I THINK IN WITH RESPECT TO FIREFIGHTERS I WAS A SAY THAT INFRASTRUCTURE ROADS EGRESS BUILDING STANDARD SCHOOLS HOMELESS OF HOUSING ALL OF THAT IMPACTS THE JOB THE FIREFIGHTERS DO. SO THIS IMPACTS FIREFIGHTERS WERE POST THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON SHAUN THOSE THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS REPRESENTING A VERY BROAD DIVERSE CROSS SECTION OF INDUSTRIES IN OUR IN OUR SUSPICIONS SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND IF HE DOES NOT HAVE A FORMAL POSITION ON THIS INITIATIVE UNTIL IT -- FORMALLY IS CERTIFIED FOR THE BALLOT BUT WE DID WANT TO PROVIDE. A COUPLE QUICK BULLET POINTS MY RESEARCH OUR MEMBERS WHICH IS REFLECTED I THINK OF MANY SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE STATE -- WHICH ABOUT OUR MEMBERS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND IN EVERY STATE ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO GIVES US A GOOD -- INSIGHT AS TO SOME TRENDS AND WE CAN COMPARE THEM TO DIFFERENT STATES I WANNA SHARE COUPLE QUICK POINTS -- NFIB MEMBERS IN A RECENT SURVEY NATIONALLY RANKED STATE AND LOCAL TAXES EITHER AS OUR NINTH MOST SIGNIFICANT ISSUE A BURDEN AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL BUT IN CALIFORNIA THEY READ AS OUR FOURTH MOST SIGNIFICANT BURDEN OR ISSUE IT'S A SIGNIFICANT. DEVIATION FROM THE NATIONAL TREND ALSO IN A VERY RECENT SURVEY JUST LAST MONTH 87% OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE SAID THAT -- THEY FIND IT RECENT FEDERAL TAX REFORM. 75% OF BUSINESSES THINK THAT WILL HAVE A DIRECT POSITIVE IMPACT ON THEIR BUSINESS THE POINT IN THESE DATA POINTS. IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S TAX CLIMATE IS A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN FOR ANY BUSINESS BUT ESPECIALLY FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND OUR MEMBERS TELL US IT'S NOT JUST THE HIGH STATE INCOME TAX RATE OR STATE SALES TAX RATE. OR HIGHEST GAS TAKES GAS PRICES ADMITS WHEN YOU ADD ALL OF IN FOR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS WHEN YOU ADD A HALF CENT SALES TAX OR LOCAL FEVER SPECIAL PROJECT. IS SUFFOCATING SMALL BUSINESS OWNER SO WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION AT THIS POINT I'M BUT WE DO SUPPORT AN ADDITIONAL TAX FOR PROTECTION FOR ALL TAXPAYERS AND SMALL BUSINESS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS BRIAN RAYMOND I MAKE COUNCIL MEMBER FROM THE CITY ABOUT WATER AND I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE TAXPAYER PROTECTION ACT. TAXPAYERS DESERVE TO KNOW HOW THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS THEIR TAX DOLLARS AND COMING FROM A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SUCH AS THAT WATER. I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND HOW HIDDEN TAXES AND FEES AFFECT THE YEAH HARD WORKING RESIDENTS DATED DAY. AND IT'S IT'S IT'S UNACCEPTABLE WE NEED [inaudible] TO VOTE YES ON THIS AYE I HEARD YOU GUYS WERE THIS IS WELL SO WE CAN GET IT AT A COMMITTEE. INTO OR OUT. ON THE BALLOT. I THINK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS JOSH WILL WILL GO WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES.

ON THE PROP THIRTEEN IS OFTEN BROUGHT UP IN THIS DISCUSSION I'D BE REMISS IF WE DIDN'T WISH THAT IT TOO REQUIRED A TWO THIRDS VOTE -- AND MAYBE ARE PURE PER PEOPLE SPENDING WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER THAN IT IS TODAY -- WE THINK THIS WILL BE SEVERE BURDEN ON LOCALITIES NINE WHICH SCHOOLS OFTEN RELY ON SOME JOINT. OUR EFFORTS TO BRING BETTER OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS AND SO WE WILL BE HERE WE ARE OFFICIALLY IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE MATTHEW MOSON WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE AND WE ARE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. I THINK WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM ASSEMBLYMAN BLOOM THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT THIS MEASURE WOULD HAVE. IN REMOVING THE ABILITY OF LOCAL MINISTER TO RESPOND SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. NOT JUST AS A STATE BUT AS A NATION AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT THESE ON JUST HEALTH CHALLENGES. THESE ARE ALSO CHALLENGES THAT WILL UNDERMINE OUR ABILITY AS A STATE. AND AS COMMUNITIES TO RESPOND AND BE ECONOMICALLY COMPETITIVE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. SO IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL THAT WE OPPOSE THIS MEASURE. AND ENSURE THAT CITIES AND COUNTIES AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE CAN HAVE THE TOOLS AT ITS DISPOSAL TO RESPOND TO THESE REALLY CRITICAL HEALTH CHALLENGES WHETHER THAT'S POOR AIR QUALITY IMPACTING ASTHMA.
