MEETINGUTILITY AND ENERGY COMMITTEE. WE HAVE OUR AUTHOR WHO IS HERE WE HAVE TO MEMBERS THAT WOULD GET US TO A QUORUM I WAS HOPING THAT WE NEED ONE MORE -- SO THAT WE CAN JUMP RIGHT INTO THE THE MEAT OF THIS BUT MR CHIU IF YOU'D LIKE. TO COME FORWARD YOU HAVE A. B. SEVEN THAT'S BEFORE US TODAY RECOMMENDATION -- FROM THE COMMITTEES TO PASS TO THE FLOOR. HEY YOU CAN BEGIN. THANK YOU I WAS GONNA MISS RICHARD THING FROM THE MEMBER. NOW I ARE HERE 2% A. B. SEVEN WHICH WAS SET CALIFORNIA ON DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME ALL YEAR ROUND. PENDING FEDERAL APPROVAL. IF PASSED THIS BILL WILL GO INTO EFFECT THE MARCH FOLLOWING THE FEDERAL AUTHORIZED THE XIN. IN NOVEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA VOTERS EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT TO ELIMINATE THE BI ANNUAL TYING SWITCH -- WITH THE MORE MORE THAN 60% APPROVAL OF THE BALLOT MEASURE AUTHORIZING THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER THIS ISSUE THAT'S WHY WORK HERE. AND DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME WAS ADOPTED DURING THE WAR TIME TO SAVE ENERGY HARDLY EVER DID RESEARCH SHOWS THE THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION PATENT HAS CHANGED. LOCAL BOOK QUITE A BIT IN AND THE LAST. YEARS -- DOES PRACTICE IS NO LONGER A DOES SHOW. AND ASKED TO COME MEDIA ANALYSIS POINT OUT YOU'RE WRONG DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME COULD EVEN HAVE POTENTIAL POSITIVE IN THE G. IMPACT. FOR THE ALIGNMENT OF SOLAR PRODUCTION. ADDITIONALLY A STUDY HOW. LONG SHOWN THE NEGATIVE EFFECT OF BI ANNUAL TIME SWITCH INCLUDING THE INCREASE TRAFFIC AND TO WORKPLACE ACCIDENT. HEART ATTACK A STROKE AND OWN ON ON THE DAY FOLLOWING THIS SPRING FORWARD. SO WE WE ARE NOT ALONE IN CONSIDERING THIS PRACTICE. EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN AFTER CALL TWENTY OF HOUSE TO OF PROSTITUTION. SEVEN THIRTY NINE EIGHT ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION EXPRESSING INTEREST IN ELIMINATING THE BI ANNUAL TIMES WHICH INCLUDING OUR NEIGHBORS. OR ARE ON OREGON AND AND AND THEIR NEIGHBORS TO WASHINGTON STATE. DOES YOUR THREE DIFFERENT PIECES ALL FEDERAL LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED. TWO PLAYS TO COUNTY ON DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME YOU'RE WRONG OR GIVEN THE STAYED THE DISCRETION TO CHOOSE STANDARD TIME MORE DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME. ALRIGHT STATE RECORDS AND MY MY A OF STATE REPRESENTATIVE ROLE CONNER. IS A CO SPONSOR OF ALL ONE OF THE BUILDING AND INTRODUCED IN THE HOUSE A REPRESENT A REPRESENTATIVES. AND MARCO RUBIO PHAM OF FLORIDA IS ALSO AUTHORED A BILL IN THE SENATE. AND LAST YEAR. THIS BODY PASS A BILL TO ALLOW VOTERS TO CONSIDER. THE PRACTICE OFFICE REGION OR CLOCK. AND THE VOTER HAS SPOKEN. I AM I WITH ME TODAY AND BY THE A JOINT AUTHOR. AS THE MISTER. BUT OBERNOLTE YOU HAVE A CLUE HOW MUCH -- IF WE COULD BEFORE YOU MAKE YOUR COMMENTS SENATE MEMBER WE DO HAVE A QUORUM SO LET'S.

OKAY BILLS BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED -- WILL TURN TO YOU MISTER OBERNOLTE FOR YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M A PROUD TO BE A JOINT AUTHOR OF THE OF AB SEVEN ASSEMBLYMAN SHE WHAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR FOUR YEARS NOW THIS ISSUE -- AND IT'S REALLY GRATIFYING TO SEE IT HAVE COME THIS FAR. THIS BEING UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE I WANTED TO AMPLIFY SOME OF THE ASSEMBLYMAN COMMENTS REGARDING THE POTENTIAL ENERGY SAVINGS THAT THIS ACTION COULD UNLOCK. I'M SURE WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR ON THIS COMMITTEE WITH A DARKER -- THAT THE FACT THAT WE OVER PRODUCE RENEWABLES DURING THE DAYLIGHT HOURS AND UNDER PRODUCE THEM IN THE EVENING HOURS. WHEN DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME WAS FIRST INSTITUTED THE PEAK ENERGY CONSUMPTION OCCURRED DURING THE AFTERNOON ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN EVERYONE RAN THEIR AIR CONDITIONERS BUT AS A VERY DIFFERENT SITUATION NOW NOW WE HAVE THIS PROBLEM? WHERE WE ARE UNDER PRODUCING RENEWABLES IN THE EVENING WHEN PEOPLE ARE TURNING ON THEIR LIGHTS SO THAT'S WHY SWITCH TO DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIMES FULL TIME WELL REALLY -- HELP WITH THAT SITUATION FACT THE LATEST FIGURES THAT I'VE SEEN SAY THAT A SHIFT TO FULL TIME DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME WILL SAVE. ABOUT A THREE THOUSAND MEGAWATT HOURS OF ELECTRICITY EVERY DAY THAT WILL SAVE CALIFORNIA REPAIRS OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- IN ELECTRICITY CHARGES EVERY YEAR IN ADDITION TO HELPING. OUR STATE MEDIA IT'S CLEAN ENERGY GOALS SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I THINK THAT THE TIME HAS COME FOR THIS CHANGE IN CALIFORNIA AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ANYONE FROM THE AUDIENCE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL SAY NONE AT OPPOSITION. SAY NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONSMISTER MAYES. I JUST WANT TO SAY I THINK THIS IS A FANTASTIC BILL IT'S LONG OVERDUE THANK YOU GUYS FOR DOING THE WORK -- I WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR. IF YOU'D. THANK YOU BE INTERESTED. YES THANK YOU YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB FOR SYSTEM PAYS OFF AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD -- TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS THAT COULD COME OUT OF THIS AS WELL -- WE HAVE A MOTION -- THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE FLOOR A ROLL CALL.

NO ACTION TO BE TAKEN ON THIS BUT WE WELCOME ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURKE TO PRESENT -- A. B. ELEVEN FORTY THREE QUIRK THIS IS A ENERGY RENEWABLE GAS PROGRAM. NUMBER THEN -- TO BE SURE. THANKS FOR THAT -- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M PRESENTING AB ELEVEN FORTY THREE ON BEHALF OF DOCTOR CORRECT DOCTOR QUIRK WOULD LIKE TO THINK -- THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH HIS OFFICE AND OUR CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO IMPROVE THIS MEASURE. HIS MOTIVATION AND WANTING TO PRESENT TODAY IS TO START A CONVERSATION DOCTOR QUIRK WOULD ALSO LIKE TO STATE FOR THE RECORD THAT HE WILL BE LIMITING THIS BILL TO RENEWABLE GAS PRODUCED IN STATE. IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS. AB ELEVEN FORTY THREE WITH LEVERAGE EXISTING UTILITY INFRASTRUCTURE TO DEVELOP A MORE RESILIENT AND COMPREHENSIVE DE CARBONIZATION STRATEGY FOR BUILDINGS WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY HELPING A CHEAP ORGANIC WEEKS WASTE DIVERSION SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS. AND AIR QUALITY GOALS. THIS MEASURE CREATES A PROGRAM TO INCENTIVIZE CUSTOMERS TO USE RENEWABLE GASES FOOLS FUELS INCLUDING RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS RENEWABLE HYDROGEN AND RENEWABLE PROPANE INSTEAD OF FOSSIL FUELS. I IN ITS MOST RECENT SCOPING PLANNING CALIFORNIA RUSHES OF RESOURCES BOARD STATED THAT WE MUST MOVE TOWARDS CLEANER HEATING FUELS. THIS STARTS WITH EFFICIENCY AND DEMAND REDUCTION INCLUDING BUILDING AN APPLIANCE ELECTRIFICATION WHERE THESE ADVANCE ADVANCEMENTS MAKE SENSE AND INCLUDING USING MORE RENEWABLE GAS. REPLACING FOSSIL FUELS WILL WITH RENEWABLE GAS CAN REDUCE POTENT SO SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS AND STATE POLICY SHOULD SUPPORT IN THIS EFFORT. USING DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS AND MOVING TOWARDS RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS WELL CALIFORNIA ACHIEVE ITS TWENTY THIRTY CLIMATE TARGETS TESTIFYING ANSWERING TECHNICAL QUESTIONS WITH ME TODAY IS NINA COMPORT WITH THE COALITION FOR NOBLE NATURAL GAS. AND TIM CARMICHAEL A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN HOLDEN AND MEMBERS IN A COOPER AND THE DIRECTOR OF STATE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE COALITION FOR RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AND WITH THE SPONSORS OF THIS LEGISLATION. AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE DESCRIBED BUILDING D. CARBONIZATION HAS BECOME A KEY CLIMATE PRIORITY FOR THE STATE WHILE THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD HAS EXPLICITLY RECOMMENDED A TWO PRONGED STRATEGY. OF BOTH APPLIANCE ELECTRIFICATION AND THE USE OF RENEWABLE GAS THAT'S FAR THE LEGISLATURE HAS ONLY DIRECTED STATE AGENCIES TO PURSUE A APPLIANCE ELECTRIFICATION. WE UNDERSTAND THE DESIRE TO FOCUS ON ELECTRIFICATION AS AN EXCITING AND EMERGING OPPORTUNITY BUT RENEWABLE GAS ALSO HAS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE TO PLAY IN THE SECTOR. SPECIFICALLY A RENEWABLE GAS IS AVAILABLE TODAY TO BE USED TO DE CARBONIZED EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE ORIGINALLY BUILT TO TRANSPORT FASA NATURAL GAS. DEVELOPMENT EVER NOBLE GAS FROM ORGANIC WASTE RESOURCES IS CRITICAL IF WE ARE TO ACHIEVE THE STATE START OF CLIMATE PUTTING CALLS. AND SCENARIO WORK BY NAVIGANT CONSULTING CLEARLY SHOWS THAT I'M PLAYING RENEWABLE GAS ALONG SIDE ELECTRIFICATION WHERE APPROPRIATE CAN LEAD TO MORE COST EFFECTIVE OUTCOMES IN THE BUILDING SECTOR. AB ELEVEN FORTY THREE IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO OVER NOBLE GAS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS FOR RESIDENTIAL CONSUMERS. AS YOUR EXCELLENT COMMITTEE BACKGROUND DOCUMENT POINTS OUT THE CC IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NOTED THAT RENEWABLE GAS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO NATURAL GAS VEHICLES IN THE SHORT TERM. WE'RE PLEASED TO REPORT TODAY THAT WE ARE APPROACHING A 100% SATURATION IN THE VEHICLE SPACE. AND YET WE STILL HAVE A GREAT VOLUME OF METHANE WE NEED TO FIND A HOME FOR IN ORDER TO MEET OUR STATUTORY REQUIREMENT OF A TWENTY THIRTY USING IT TO DISPLAY SOME OF THE ONE TRILLION CUBIC FEET OF NATURAL GAS THAT WE USE IN OUR BUILDINGS TODAY IS A COMMON SENSE PLACE TO START. WE APPRECIATE THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEES WINE IS TO WORK WITH US IN THE INTERIM TO DESIGN AN OPTIMAL CONSUMER FACING PROGRAM. I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS MIGHT HAVE TODAY AND IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR HOLDEN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE TIM CARMICHAEL IS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY. IN THE FIRST TECH GO ON IN HIS COMMENTS ABOUT -- OUR P. SHE XIN -- WORKING WITH THE CHAIR IN CHAIRS OFFICE ON THIS ISSUE AND RECOGNIZING THAT -- HOPEFULLY MANY MORE DISCUSSIONS TO COME OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR --% SO CAL GAS IS AN ARDENT SUPPORTER OF RENEWABLE GASES -- WE HAVE A TEAM WORKING ON RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS WE HAVE A TEAM WORKING ON HYDROGEN -- EFFORTS WE SEE -- BOTH OF THESE AS INTEGRAL TO THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY. STRATEGY -- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF BUZZ ABOUT ELECTRIFICATION AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WE CAN ACCOMPLISH WITH BATTERIES AND ELECTRICITY BUT WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT IT MAKES SENSE TO HAVE A PORTFOLIO APPROACH. WHETHER YOUR GOAL IS ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS -- RESILIENCY IN OUR ENERGY SYSTEM. COST SAVINGS FOR ONE OF OUR BIG CHALLENGES THAT I THINK THERE'S A GROWING AWARENESS ABOUT IS WHAT WE GONNA DO ABOUT ENERGY STORAGE -- BATTERIES ARE DEFINITELY GONNA PLAY A ROLE BU ARE THEY GOING TO MEET ALL THE NEEDS AND THEIR I THINK THERE'S A GROWING AWARENESS NOT ONLY IN IN EUROPE BUT ACROSS AMERICA. THAT -- WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT OTHER -- LONGER TERM ENERGY STORAGE OPTIONS AND RENEWABLE GASES WE BELIEVE COMPLACENT AFRICAN ROLE IN THAT. THERE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS IN THE BRIEFING PAPER THAT I JUST WANT. TO SPEAK TO A A COUPLE OF THOSE -- THERE. THERE'S THERE'S A BROAD QUESTION ABOUT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO MOVE AHEAD WITH THIS EFFORT AT THIS TIME ARE THERE OTHER -- EFFORTS THAT NEED TO PLAY OUT FIRST RATHER LEGISLATION THAT NEEDS TO PLAY OUT FIRST BEFORE WE MOVE AHEAD WITH. A STRATEGY LIKE THIS A PROGRAM LIKE THIS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS APPROACH -- DEVELOPING A CONSUMER ORIENTED INCENTIVE FOR THE USE OF A NOBLE GASES IS COMPLEMENTARY TO AT OTHER EFFORTS UNDER WAY. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE EFFORTS THAT ARE ACTIVE RIGHT NOW ARE INCENTIVES TO PRODUCE -- RENEWABLE GASES IN CALIFORNIA NOT NECESSARILY TO CONSUME THEM AND NOT DIRECTED AT THE THE CONSUMERS AND WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE BOTH. JUST LIKE WE'VE DONE OVER TIME IN THE RENEWABLE ENERGY SPACE WE HAD INCENTIVES TO PURGE TO PRODUCE MORE SOLAR AND WIND AND WE INCENTIVES FOR CONSUMERS. TO TO BUY THAT -- THAT ENERGY OR THAT ELECTRICITY GENERATED FROM THE SOURCES -- ONE OTHER POINT I WANT TO MENTION -- RELATES TO A COMMENT IN REFERENCE TO AB THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO WHICH IS A MISS FRIEDMAN BILL FROM LAST YEAR. THIS IS A THE REFERENCE IN THE IN THE BRIEFING PAPER IT. WE THANK -- CONTINUES A COMMON MISPERCEPTION ABOUT A FEW BILLS THAT PASSED IN THE LAST YEAR. TO THEY WERE AND IF YOU IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE LANGUAGE THEY ARE -- AND D. CARBONIZATION OF BUILDING DE CARBONIZATION BILLS. THE AGENCY SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA AGENCIES HAVE CHOSEN TO FOCUS ON BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION. BUT THE LEGISLATION -- THAT PASSED WAS BUILDING D. CARBONIZATION. UNDER THAT UMBRELLA WE THINK WE'RE NOBLE GASES ARE -- TODAY AND CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR BUILDING D. CARBONIZATION ELECTRIFICATION IS ONE STRATEGY. NOBLE GASES IS ANOTHER STRATEGY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FOR YOUR ATTENTION THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS. THANK YOU -- IS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE WHO WOULD LIKE. TO HELLO AND THEIR THEIR VOICE. TO THE SUBJECT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AND YOUR AUNTS WEEK HERE ON BEHALF OF THE WESTERN PROPANE GAS ASSOCIATION. WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR THROUGH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE INCLUDING RENEWABLE PROPANE. AND WHAT'S ENVISIONED A FOR THIS BILL GOING FORWARD WE'D LIKE TO CONTINUE TO BE A STAKEHOLDER AS A CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE INTO NEXT YEAR. WE SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KATE ON WHO DROWNED THE CALIFORNIA STATE COUNCIL LABORS ALSO IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MATT CRIMMINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEVADA CONFERENCE OF OPERATING ENGINEERS HAPPY TO BE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. ARE THERE OTHERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WITH HER. OKAY WILL WELCOME YOU. THANK YOU CHEN MEMBERS NIKITA CROWDED WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL BUT APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS -- INTEREST IN ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE FALL TO PAY BETTER ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE. BOB I AM I THINK IS A VALUABLE RESOURCE IN CALIFORNIA TO BOTH REDUCE OUR METHANE EMISSIONS AND DISPLAYS FOSSIL FUEL USE ALL THE HOUSES WE'VE REVIEWED. SO FAR IDENTIFY THAT THERE'S AN EXTREMELY LIMITED SUPPLY BY METHANE RELATIVE TO CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA'S DEMAND FOR METHANE GAS. AND THAT SOME OF THE SOURCES ARE VERY HIGH COST WE NEED TO GET CLEAR ON HOW MUCH REALLY EXISTS AT WHAT COST AND IMPORTANTLY WHAT THE BEST USE OF THIS LIMITED RESOURCE AS FAR AS THE EYE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT. THERE SEVERAL ONGOING PROCESS THE THAT SHOULD PROVIDE MORE INSIGHT ON THESE QUESTIONS. THE CZ IS EXPECTED TO RELEASE RESULTS FROM THE EPIC FUNDED STUDIES STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT OF THE LONG TERM ROLE OF NATURAL GAS IN CALIFORNIA LATER THIS YEAR. THE CBC'S ALSO ASSESSING OPTIONS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND BUILDINGS BY 40% BY TWENTY THIRTY AS DIRECTED IN AB THIRTY TO THIRTY TWO AS YOU HEARD EARLIER. WHICH IS PART OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN I PER AND IN ADDITION THERE SHOULD BE A PC ACTIVITY TO CONSIDER BY A MYTH THAT METHANE PROCUREMENT. AS DIRECTED BY SB FOURTEEN FORTY WORK WERE WE ARE CONCERNED THAT AS YEAH AB ELEVEN FORTY THREE PRE JUDGES THE RESULT IN IMPLICATIONS OF THESE EFFORTS WHICH MIGHT END UP WORKING AT CROSS PURPOSES WITH OTHER STATE POLICY. POLICY THAT ARE AIMED AT REDUCING DEPENDENCE ON GAS INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING THROUGH BOTH THESE EXISTING FORMS AND WHAT THE AUTHOR AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS -- ON TOPICS RELATED TO BEST USING CALIFORNIA'S METHANE AND BY MATH AND RESOURCES THANK YOU. AND THEN MICHAEL BOOKER ON BEHALF OF THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATIONAL TRYING TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE -- OUR CLIENTS REPRESENT -- FOLKS THAT ARE NOT ONLY IN THE BUSINESS OF DEVELOPING BY METHANE PROJECTS AND SO WERE HIGHLY SUPPORTIVE. THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE OF THAT BY A METHANE THOSE S. TRANSPORTATION FUEL NOT FOR USE IN BUILDINGS NOT FOR USE IN HOMES NOT FOR USE IN BUSINESSES. BUSINESS COMMUNITY CAN'T AFFORD TO USE BY METHANE IN OUR FACTORIES PERIOD. IT'S FIVE TEN FIFTEEN TIMES AS EXPENSIVE. AS RENEWED AS CONVENTIONAL NATURAL GAS SO IT'S NOT AN OPTION FOR US AND WON'T BE AN OPTION FOR US. AND THAT GETS LOST IN THIS DEBATE A LOT IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS ARE GOING TO BE CONSIDERING AT SOME POINT THIS YEAR. IS COST CONCERNS ABOUT ELECT RISING ELECTRICITY PRICES FROM ALL OF THE ISSUES RELATED TO WILD FIRE. AND IT IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO ELECTRIFY BUILDINGS GOING FORWARD IF OUR ELECTRICITY PRICES ARE SUPER HIGH. BUT USING BIO METHANE AND BUILDINGS THAT HAS THE EXACT SAME EMISSIONS PROFILE. DOES CONVENTIONAL NATURAL GAS SO IT'S NOT A SOLUTION TO REDUCE CO TWO FROM BUILDINGS. NOT NOW NOT TEN YEARS FROM NOW AND IT'S NOT COST EFFECTIVE FORCE WERE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF IT DON'T GET ME WRONG MY DERRY'S ARE PRODUCING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF BY METHANE. IT'S ALL GOING INTO TRANSPORTATION FEEL AND IT HAS A VERY VALUABLE BENEFITS THEY'RE NOT ONLY REDUCES NOTHING ITS CARBON NEGATIVE. IT ALSO HAS A TREMENDOUS BENEFIT WHEN REPLACES DIESEL IS TRANSPORTATION FEEL. GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE FIFTY MILLION GALLONS. EXCUSE ME DIESEL GALA QUOTE ONCE ARE GONNA BE PRODUCED BY JERRY BIO DIED JESTERS. IN THE NEAR TERM. USING THAT AND HEAVY DUTY FREIGHT AS A REPLACEMENT FOR DIESEL. WILL REDUCE EMISSIONS OF KNOX BY ELEVEN HUNDRED TONS PER YEAR. ABOUT THREE TONS PER DAY IT'S HUGE IT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT THAT'S THE HIGHEST AND BEST USE OF BY A METHANE. NOT FOR REPLACEMENT OF NATURAL GAS AND HOMES BUILDINGS ARE BUSINESSES. THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE. TO A SURE THEIR THOUGHTS ON THIS INFORMATIONAL ITEMS. HEARING NONE AND SEEN ON ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE TO THE WITNESS. WELL THANK YOU AGAIN MISS WORK YOU'VE STEPPED IN AND THANK YOU FOR ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUES WE AGAIN. YEAH. YOUR OFFICIAL DESIGNATED HITTER. BUT I THINK IT IS AN IMPORTANT SUBJECT AND AS WE SHARED WITH DOCTOR QUIRK -- WHEN WE WERE VIEW AND THEN -- ANALYZING THE BILL THAT THERE IS OPPORTUNITY -- FOR FURTHER REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AND HOW THAT COULD BE INNER INTEGRATED -- BUT WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THERE'S STILL A LOT OF MOVING PARTS AND SO WE APPRECIATE -- WHO IS WORKING WITH US -- AND ALL INTERESTED PARTIES -- OVER THE NEXT YEAR -- WE WILL -- THIS. HAVING THE ITEM ON THE AGENDA TODAY AS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING IS ALSO. TO INDICATE OUR INTERESTED AND WANTED TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND TO BE ABLE TO GIVE IT. TO THE APPROPRIATE CONVERSATION THAT IT'S IT'S A DESERVE. SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BEING IF YOU HAVE ANY I JUST WANT IT REALLY QUICKLY I'LL JUST RESPOND A LITTLE BIT TO THE OPPOSITION -- FIRST OBVIOUSLY WE ALL KNOW DR COURT TO BE VERY PRICE SENSITIVE SO I THINK THAT ANYTHING THAT COMES OUT WE ALL KNOW THAT THAT IT WILL TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION ALSO I BELIEVE. THANK YOU FOR THE COMMITTEES. WILLINGNESS TO EVEN HAVE THE CONVERSATION I KNOW HIS GOAL IS NOT TO GET AHEAD. OF ALL OF THE PROCESS GOING ON SI PC IS IN THE PROCESS OF SOME THINGS I WAS WE'VE HEARD OTHERS -- I THINK HIS HOPE IS TO MOVE IN TANDEM WITH THAT AND I THINK THIS IS HIS OPPORTUNITY HAVE THAT IS TO TO BEGIN THAT CONVERSATION -- AND THEN ON THE TRANSPORTATION I THINK HE WANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE REALIZE THAT NATURAL GAS IS BEING PUSHED OUT OF THAT TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AND SO. THERE ARE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT THAT. ARE USEFUL -- HE BELIEVES THAT DECOMPOSITION IS SIGNIFICANT ISSUE AND WILL GREATLY BENEFIT FROM A FULL INFORMATIONAL HEARING WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE AND WITH THAT. THANKS FOR HAVING ME OKAY. ALL RIGHT IN HERE -- WE WERE GOING TO WE'RE GONNA TURN BACK -- TO A. B. -- SEVEN WE HAVE A AND GO BACK THROUGH THE ROLE -- FOR MEMBERS TO ADD ON THAT BILL IS ON CALL AND THAT'S CHIU DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME. SO -- WILL CALL THE ROLL -- FOR MEMBERS TO TAKE A VOTE ON A. B. SEVEN UP PATTERSON. PATTERSON NOT VOTING -- CARILLO CARILLO I CRISTINA GARCIA CRISTINA GARCIA I EDUARDO GARCIA. TING. TING I THE BILL HAS. PLUS TEN VOTES THE BILL IS OUT -- WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN. FOR MOMENT FOR OTHERS TO ADD ON AND THEN WE WILL -- WE HAVE THE CONSENT CALENDAR ITEM -- ITEMS -- ALL THE ROLE. ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR ITEMS AND IT HAS THE REQUISITE VOTES SO IT IS OUT THIS IS JUST ADDING ON PATTERSON. THIS CONSENT YES. PATTERSON I CARILLO. CARILLO I CRISTINA GARCIA. CRISTINA GARCIA HI EDUARDO GARCIA. JEAN. TING HI. THERE ARE TWELVE VOTES IN FAVOR THE CONSENT CALENDAR. IT IS ADOPTED BUT WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR ANY ABSENT MEMBERS TO ADD ON TO AB SEVEN AND CONSENT WILL OVER THAT OPEN FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES RIGHT FUNDS. OKAY WE'RE GONNA RECORD THE THE LAST ROLE AS THE FINAL AND WE ARE RICHER. THE OTHER THE OTHER TWO ARE
