NOW I WOULD LIKE TO ASK OUR COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS TO PLEASE CALL ROLE. HERE MATHIS WE'RE- RAMOS YEAH HEAR WHAT YOU'RE. I HAVE A FEW BRIEF OPENING REMARKS AS WE BEGIN THIS HEARING. GIVEN ALL OF OUR CHALLENGES AS A CALIFORNIA AND THE WORLD COMMUNITY DEALS WITH KOPET NINETEEN PANDEMIC WE HAVE LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES TO HOLD SOMEONE HEARINGS. TODAY'S HEARING IS ON A CRITICAL SUBJECT THAT WE PUSHED HARD TO CONVENE THIS GROUP OF LAWMAKERS TO DISCUSS. THE ADMINISTRATION IS DEVELOPING A PROPOSAL THAT COULD MEAN DRAMATIC CHANGES IN OUR MEDIC CAL LONG TERM LANDSCAPE. WE DON'T KNOW THE SETTLED DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL AND THIS IS A MAJOR REASON WHY ARE WE WHY WE ARE ASKING FOR A TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FORMAL PUBLIC AND DELIBERATIVE PROCESS TO PROPERLY VET WHAT AT WHAT EVER COMES FORWARD FROM THE pADMINISTRATION. THIS IS KEY AS A PROPOSAL NOT AS A SETTLED PIECE OF POLICY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION MOVES FORWARD TO IMPLEMENT WITHOUT US. THE CONTENT OF ANY NEW BENEFIT IS CRITICAL OF COURSE. BY THE DEFINITION OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OF OUR CALIFORNIA ELDERLY AND DISABLED THAT IT WILL IMPACT. BUT THE PROCESS TO ACHIEVE ANY POLICY OUTCOME IS THE SEED AND ROOT OF THAT POLICY. AND IF WE DON'T HAVE A PROCESS OUTLINED FOR THIS THAT IS ACCEPTABLE. AGAIN A MAJOR GOAL OF THIS HEARING IS TO UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION ON THIS AT THIS TIME AND TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE WANT A PUBLIC LEGISLATIVE PROCESS FOR ANYTHING THAT HAS DECIDED IN THIS AREA. NOW WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE ARE AT RISK AND DYING TODAY IN NURSING HOMES AND OTHER CONGREGATE SETTINGS WE NEED ACTION FROM THE STATE NOW TO SAVE LIVES. THE LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORT SUB COMMITTEE OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING IS A GROUP OF WELL RESPECTED LEADERS ACROSS THE AGING CONTINUUM OF CARE. THESE LEADERS HAVE PUT FORWARD RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTIONS THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING SERIOUSLY. WE APPLAUD THAT WORK AND WOULD ASK FOR MORE FOCUS AND ATTENTION AND INVESTMENT THERE. IT IS CRITICAL THAT OUR CORE PROGRAMS IN HOME SUPPORTIVE SERVICES OR IT TEST SAYS COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES SEABASS MULTI PURPOSES SENIOR SERVICES PROGRAM MSSP AND CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTERS ARE STRENGTHENED AND THAT THEIR CAPACITY IS EXPANDED. IF WE ARE BY DESIGN TRYING TO ENSURE THAT MORE OF OUR OLDER ADULTS IN NEED ARE STAYING AT HOME AND IN THAT THEIR COMMUNITIES. AVOIDING CONGREGATE SETTINGS LIKE NURSING HOMES DURING THE COPA NINETEEN CRISIS WE HAVE TO RECOMMIT TO THESE CORE PROGRAMS. BEFORE I ASK OTHER MEMBERS TO HAVE OPENING REMARKS I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF THIS OVERSIGHT HEARING. WE WANT A PUBLIC PROCESS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE FOR THE PURPOSE AND CONSIDERATION OF ANY PROPOSAL THAT COMES FORWARD ON LONG TERM CARE AT HOME AND WE'RE ASKING FOR CONTINUE CONTINUED SERIOUS ENGAGEMENT ON THE STAKEHOLDER CRISIS RECOMMENDATIONS. THAT HAVE BEEN PUT FORWARD TO REDUCE PRESSURE ON NURSING HOMES AND TO KEEP OLDER ADULTS WITH CHRONIC NEEDS SAFE AND IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE ARE BEING VERY DIRECT ABOUT THESE OBJECTIVES WE ARE ASKING TO HEAR CLARITY AND RESPONSE FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. I'M GOING TO ASK NOW IF OTHER MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO MAKE OPENING REMARKS BEFORE WE BEGAN TO LISTEN TO OUR PANELS I'D LIKE TO WELCOME THE CHAIR OF OUR BUDGET COMMITTEE. CHAIRED TEAM AS WELL AS CHAIR NECESSARY IN OF AGING AND CHAIR RAILS OF HUMAN SERVICES I'D LIKE TO START BY OFFERING TO SEE IF ANY MEMBERS HAVE OPENING COMMENTS. COURAGEOUS. THANK IN THIS HEARING. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH MY COLLEAGUES ON THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE AS WE ASSESS THE LONG TERM CARE AT HOME BENEFIT. POSTAL AN IMMEDIATE NEEDS FOR OUR POPULATION IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. THE DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING TODAY AFFECTS THE LIVES OF SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS ARE ELDERLY AND LOW INCOME POPULATIONS AND WE HAVE TO SEEK SOLUTIONS TO THE ISSUES THAT THEY'RE FACING. THE CURRENT CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT NEW SOLUTIONS ARE NECESSARY TO CARE FOR THOSE ALREADY IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND THOSE WHO WOULD TRANSITION INTO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. WHAT IS ALSO BEEN MADE CLEAR IS THAT WE NEED BOTH IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS CONCERNS RELATED TO THE CURRENT PANDEMIC AND WE ALSO NEED TO DEVELOP LONG TERM STRATEGIES TO HELP PEOPLE TRANSITION FROM A FACILITY TO THE COMMUNITY. AS THE CHAIR OF THE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE MANY PEOPLE IN THESE POPULATIONS. AND WANT TO INSURE THAT THEY RECEIVE SERVICES FROM MULTIPLE PROGRAMS INCLUDING THOSE INSOCIAL SERVICES AND WE MUST BE MINDFUL THAT ANY SOLUTIONS THAT ARE FORMULATED DO NOT DISRUPT THE SERVICES THAT ARE ALREADY BEING RECEIVED. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO OUR OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES THROUGHOUT THE CURRENT CRISIS. I WOULD LIKE TO URGE THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE ONGOING DIALOGUE AND INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE WELL VETTED STRATEGIES. DURING THE HEARING I LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE LONG TERM BENEFIT LONG TERM CARE BENEFITS. AND STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE THE CURRENT CRISIS THE PENTOMIC HAS CREATED. I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT THE PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT THAT HAS OCCURRED THUS FAR AND PLANS FOR FUTURE INVOLVEMENT WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND THE LEGISLATURE. AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS INVITATION THANK ALL WHO HAVE JOINED US TODAY. THIRTEEN THE VICTIM IS A TO REALLY VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS HEARING IT WE KNOW THAT THIS IS A- THIS IS A ANOTHER HEARING IN A SERIES OF HEARINGS THAT WE'VE HAD ON THIS ISSUE AND THE REASON THAT. THIS COMMITTEE IS SO FOCUSED ON THE ISSUE IS. WE'VE SEEN THAT. IN RELATION TO COPE WITH GAS TO OF THE MAJOR CAUSES OF COBIT DASHED AND INFECTIONS HAD BEEN WITHIN- DIRECT PURVIEW OF THE STATE. ONE IS OUR CORRECTION SYSTEM THOSE ARE VERY WELL PUBLICIZED AS TO- VERY MUCH FOR DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE THAT INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INFECTIONS ACROSS OUR CORRECTION SYSTEMS. AND ANOTHER IS REALLY OVER THE REGULATION OF OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WITH THE STATE LEVEL AND WALL THESE ARE MOSTLY PRIVATE- ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE COMPANIES. THE STATE HAS DIRECT PURVIEW OVER THE REGULATION OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS IN AS MUCH- WE ARE ONE OF THE PRIMARY FUNDERS BECAUSE MANY OF THE RESIDENTS OF THESE FACILITIES ARE EITHER A MEDIC CAL OR MEDICARE- THEY ARE RECEIVING A PUBLIC SUBSIDIES. AND SO- WELL WE'RE NOT RUNNING THESE FACILITIES WE ARE PAYING FOR THESE FACILITIES I THINK WHAT'S BEEN MOST- DISCOURAGING IS. THE ATTITUDE OF THE ADMINISTRATION IN TERMS OF- THE PUBLIC INPUT AS WELL AS LEGISLATIVE INPUT OR LACK THEREOF- I THINK IT IS. I THINK IT IS GOOD THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SEEMS TO BE WORKING WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND WORKING WITH THE PROVIDERS WHICH IS. I BELIEVE VERY APPROPRIATE BUT WHAT HAS BEEN MISSING IS THE VOICE OF THE CUSTOMERS YOU HEAR HOW FAMILY MEMBERS CAN'T GET ANSWERS EITHER FROM THE FACILITIES OR FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AT TIMES- AND IN TERMS OF LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALSI THINK WE- HAVE PUT FORWARD A VARIETY OF PROPOSALS THAT. HAVEN'T BEEN AGREED UPON OR WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. WORK TOGETHER. AND I THINK THIS IS WHY- ARE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE SAID IN A SERIES OF HEARINGS WE HAVE ONE ON EDT AGAIN LATER THIS WEEK. THE TERM URGE THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS TO. SEEK A MORE COOPERATIVE. STANCE WITH THE LEGISLATURE PARTICULAR. AND I THINK THE PUBLIC AS WELL. WE KNOW THAT THIS- THIS CALL THE PANDEMIC IS EXTRAORDINARILY TOUGH- WE DON'T IMAGINE THAT ANYBODY HAS ALL THE RIGHT SOLUTIONS ARE THAT EVEN. THAT WE'RE GONNA BE MAKING ALL THE RIGHT DECISIONS- AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME. BUT THE KEY IS TO BE MAKING THOSE DECISIONS TOGETHER. TO BE DOING THEM IN A COLLABORATIVE MANNER. TO BE REALLY WORKING TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY. OUR MESSAGE TODAY- WELL WE HAVE QUESTIONS. IT IS NOT TO- QUESTION- WILL ONLY WITH THE STATE IS DOING BUT REALLY TO. WORK TO FIND WAYS THAT WE CAN TAKE RESPONSIBILITY GATHERED THAT WE CAN WORK COOPERATIVELY. YEAH I THINK WE- WE DID GOT TOGETHER IN OUR BUDGET PROCESS WE WERE ABLE TO CRAFT A BUDGET THAT ALL OF THE MINISTRATION THE LEGISLATURE CAME TOGETHER ON. AND WE WANT TO VERY MUCH COULD SURE THAT. WE ARE CONTINUING TO HELP AND TAKE CARE OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE- SOME OF THOSE PROTECTIONS THAT WE WERE PROUD TO DO IN THE BUDGET WAS TO ENSURE THAT CRITICAL PROGRAMS. FOR SENIORS LIKE IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES. C. BASS AS WELL AS M. S. S. P. WE'RE NOT CUT BECAUSE OTHER CRITICAL PROGRAMS. THAT SENIORS RELY ON. SO TODAY I'M JUST VERY MUCH WANT TO THANK. CHEN ARAMBULA I KNOW CHAIR WOULD HAS ALSO CONVENE HEARINGS AS WELL BUT TO CONTINUE TO DO OUR JOB TO PROVIDE THE PROPER PUBLIC OVERSIGHT OVER. THE THIS AGENCY BUT ALSO OVER THE NETWORK OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT AGAIN THE STATE IS PRIMARILY FUNDING. I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY APPROPRIATE IN AGAIN TO URGE THAT THESE FACILITIES AND- IN THE VARIOUS AGENCIES CONTINUE TO. TRY TO FIND WAYS TO WORK BETTER WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND TO TRY TO WORK BETTER WITH THE PUBLIC IN AGAIN TO TRY TO THINK DOCTOR RAMBLER FOR. CONVENING THIS AND VERY MUCH LOOK FOR TO HEAR. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD. THANK YOU DOCTOR REGULAR AND THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS HEARING TOGETHER I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL- I COMPLETELY CONCUR THAT- WE WOULD LIKE TO BE A PROCESS ACTUALLY WE'RE WE'RE REQUESTING TO BE A PROBLEM A PART OF A PROCESS IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO REALLY DIVE INTO THIS- SOME PEOPLE MAY REMEMBER- THERE WAS A LOT OF FRUSTRATION THAT ARE MAY REVISE HEARING WHEN WE HEARD THAT MSSP AND SEA BASS AND- WE'RE GOING TO BE ELIMINATED- WITH NO BRIDGE WITH NO AND THEN. A FEW DAYS LATER WITH THIS NEW PLAN ROLLED OUT WHICH WE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT. AND THAT'S THE KIND OF LACK OF COMMUNICATION WITH US THAT WE FINDING EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING AND- WHILE IT YOU KNOW THERE ARE THINGS I THINK THIS NEW BENEFIT COULD BE A REAL WIN FOR EVERYONE- THERE ARE STILL LOTS OF QUESTIONS AND FOR ME ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS WILL WILL REMAIN AT THE TOP OF THE LIST. IS IF WE ACTUALLY ARE ABLE TO DO THIS HOW DO WE TRANSITION- HOW DO WE MAKE THIS WORK FOR PEOPLE- AND- IT IS I GUESS WHAT YOU'RE HEARING PROBABLY THE MOST IS FRUSTRATION OVER PROCESS. LESS ABOUT THE CONTENT AND SO- WE WILL CONTINUE IN OUR OVERSIGHT ROLE TO PUSH ON THIS- BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS THIS COMMITTEE AS CHAIRS OF THE COMMITTEES- AND PEOPLE SERVE ON THESE COMMITTEES TO LOOK OUT FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT- AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOMES AND SERVICES SO- I'LL HAVE. LOTS OF QUESTONS TODAY AND SOME OF THEM WILL BE PRETTY DIRECT WHICH IS KIND OF MY NATURE. BUT BUT IT COMES FROM A PLACE OF REALLY WANTING TO DO THE BEST WE CAN FOR THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT- THERE IS HUGE FRUSTRATION- AND CONCERN OVER WHAT'S HAPPENED IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THERE IS HUGE FRUSTRATION AND CONCERN WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH CDC ARE- THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE- WE CAN DO BETTER. WE HAVE TO DO BETTER. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING A PART OF THE PROCESS THAT ENSURES THAT WE DO BETTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- DOCTOR GRAHAM YEAH THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING- AND INVITING THE OTHER CHAIRS HERE I THINK IT'S VERY VITAL IS ALREADY BEEN SAID THAT- WE TAKE A DEEP DIVE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRANSITIONING FROM ONE. PROGRAM AND JUST GETTING RID OF IT OVER TO SOMETHING ELSE THAT HASN'T BEEN FULLY DISCUSS INCOMPLETELY VETTED OUT- YOU KNOW IN MY DISTRICT WE GOT HIT VERY HARD WITH COVIDIEN ESPECIALLY IN OUR NURSING HOMES. AND I THINK ONE OF THE BIGGEST FRUSTRATIONS WAS THAT IT WAS STATE CONTROLLED. IN THAT ARE COUNTIES. WHO ARE THE ONES TRYING TO DEAL WITH AND MAKE DECISIONS STARK COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND. EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH. I FELT COMPLETELY HELPLESS IN REGARDS TO THESE CARE FACILITIES THE STATE CONTROLLED FACILITIES AND I THINK PART OF THIS PROCESS- MIGHT BE TO GIVE OUR LOCAL CONTROL A LITTLE BIT MORE TEETH. IN DEALING WITH BAD FACILITIES THAT WE THEY HAVE A MECHANISM BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT HERE. REALLY FROM THE FAMILIES OF THOSE THAT ARE IN THESE NURSING HOMES- THERE ON THE GROUND MORE. AND I THINK YOU KNOW I GOTTA AGREE WITH OUR BUDGET CHAIR MISTER TEAM IN REGARDS TO THAT FACT THAT THE VOICES OF THOSE ON THE HOMES AND THE VOICES OF THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS DEFINITELY NEED TO BE HEARD IN NEED TO BE FELT ESPECIALLY BUYER EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND I AGREE WITH DR WOODS THAT. YOU KNOW THE PURPOSE OF THESE HEARINGS IS TO SHOW THAT TRANSPARENCY TO SHOW THE PUBLIC THAT. YOU KNOW WE ARE DOING OUR JOBS AS LEGISLATORS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH ISN'T JUST WHIPPING THE PAN WITH YET ANOTHER EXECUTIVE ORDER. TO CHANGE THE WAY FAMILIES ARE TAKEN CARE OF HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT EVERYTHING IS BALANCED THAT. THE INTENT IS TO ENSURE BETTER CARE FOR. OUR SENIORS FOR OUR FAMILY MEMBERS FOR GRANDMA AND GRANDPA THAT ARE IN THESE FACILITIES ARE MOM AND DAD. THEN WE CAN DO BETTER BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IN MARCH AND HAS HAPPENED TO OUR SENIORS IN THESE HOMES IS. HORRIBLE AND- WE'VE SEEN THAT WITH THE STRIKE TEAMS GOING DOWN AND SPECIALLY IN OUR SOUTH VALLEY AREA- DR EMIL I KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT OF THE SAME CONCERNS WE LOSING THE STRIKE TEAMS COME IN. BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN RESULTS TURN AROUND QUITE AS QUICKLY AS I THINK WE WOULD ALL HOPE. SO I'M SURE HE WILL HAVE A VERY DELIBERATE DISCUSSION WITH LOTS OF QUESTIONS- AND I DO APPRECIATE A DOCTOR WOULD VERY POINTED THREE FOUR QUESTIONS AS WELL SO I LOOK FOR TO THE HEARING AND THANK YOU FOR PUTTING IT TOGETHER. AND THE FINAL MEMBER OPENING REMARKS TRINITARIANS. THANK YOU CHEN ARAMBULA- A VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOU CALLING ALL OF US TOGETHER AND BRINGING ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT AND TIMELY MATTER- AND QUITE FRANKLY. AND OVERLOOKED ISSUE FOR MANY DECADES- THAT'S JUST BEEN EXASPERATED EXACERBATED BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT PANDEMIC. TO BRING US ALL TOGETHER SO THAT WE CAN- CONTINUE- PROVIDING THE OVERSIGHT NECESSARY WHETHER IT WAS THROUGH THE POLICY COMMITTEE HEARING THAT WE HAD A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO ARE NOW THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AS WELL. SO COUPLE OF POINTS THAT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE- SENIORS HAVE BEEN THE AGING COMMUNITY HAS BEEN OVERLOOKED- FOR MUCH TOO LONG AND IT SEEMS THAT NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN PUTTING SOME ATTENTION. WITH WITH THE- OF LONG TERM PLAN AND- VARIOUS BUDGETARY MOVEMENTS WE'VE TRIED TO TAKE STEPS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE NEEDS BUT- IT'S STILL A PATCHWORK. THAT HASN'T BEEN SYSTEMATIZED AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW WE CAN CREATE A CATCH ALL DIRECTORY A PATH OR BEING WORKING ON THE PATH OF NO WRONG DOOR OR MAKING SURE THAT THE SYSTEM OF- SENIOR AND DISABLED KEREN SERVICES WORKS RATHER THAN. ADD YET ONE MORE PROGRAM WHICH WE WILL KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT WOULD FIT IN. WE'RE WE'RE NOW LOOKING AT A WHOLE NEW PROGRAM WITHOUT A LOT OF- DEPTH OR OR DETAIL. SO I DURING THIS HEARING I'M GONNA BE LOOKING AT SOME QUESTIONS HAVING TO DO WITH DATA COLLECTION. SPECIFICALLY FINDING OUT. WHAT IS THE DATA THAT'S EVEN DRIVING US TO GET TO THIS POINT WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. AND WHY IS IT WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO OVERCOME AND BASED ON WHAT DATA. IF WE'RE NOT EVEN SEEING THOSENUMBERS I'M JUST WONDERING HOW SOME OF THESE DECISIONS ARE. BEING DETERMINED NEXT IS THE BENEFIT FRAMEWORK AND TARGET POPULATION AGAIN HAVING TO DO WITH THE CRITERIA- CURRENT NEEDS WHICH ALSO IS GOING TO BE BASED ON DATA COLLECTION. AND THEN THE OVERSIGHT AND LEGISLATIVE ROLE SO THESE ARE THE AREAS THAT I'M GONNA BE LOOKING AT CAREFULLY AND I WILL. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ALL OF YOU HERE AS WELL SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MEMBERS WITH THAT I WANT TO BEGIN OUR FIRST PANEL WHO ARE WAITING FOR US AND THE WITNESS VIDEO ROOM. ANDFOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REPRESENTATIVE JACOB LAMB WHO IS ON THE DL LAUGH WHEN THIS VIDEO RUN. OUR FIRST PANEL WILL CONSIST OF WILL LIGHT BORN DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. KIM MCCOY WADE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND JACOB LAMB PRINCIPLE PROGRAM BUDGET ANALYST WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. MORNING IN. I WILL LIKE TO WARN AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND DR ARAMBULA IT IS A REAL PLEASURE TO BE WORKING WITH YOU ONCE AGAIN. TICKET COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS WELL- AND SURE WAS VERY ANCIENT RENTS. AND LOOK FORWARD TO. OUR WORKING RELATIONSHIP WE BEEN ASKED NOT TO. ESPECIALLY PRISON THE LONG TERM AT HOME PROPOSED BENEFIT. BUT RATHER RESPOND TO THE SERIES OF QUESTIONS ABOUT SO I. START FROM THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE COMMITTEE ON AND THE CHERISHED I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO READ OUR- ARMED CENTURY VERSION TO DOCUMENT THIS IN THE ASSEMBLY PACKAGE- OF JUST A NOTE ON THERE WILL BE A VERSION THREE DOCUMENT IN SEPTEMBER WHICH AGAIN RESPONSE TO THE- INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND THE- DOZENS AND DOZENS OF. MEETINGS ARE HOLDING AROUND THIS AND I ANTICIPATE THAT THE FOLLOWING OF. SCHERING THAT DOCUMENT WITH STAKEHOLDERS WITH OUR PROVIDER COMMUNITY CENTER. AT ALL WE WILL. HAVE A FOURTH DOCUMENT PROBABLY LET'S WAS SEEMING THAT THE DETERMINATION TO THE PROPOSED BENEFIT IS FEASIBLE- IT WOULD BE A DESIGN DOCUMENT THAT WOULD BE ULTIMATELY SUBMITTED ON A HOUSE- NINETEEN FIFTY NINETEEN FIFTEEN I- STATE PLAN AMENDMENT OF THE DODD TO GET TO WE DEEP AT THE POINT OF DOING IT AS A STATE PLAN AMENDMENT. IS THAT IS AN UNCAPPED BENEFIT THAT IS CAN BE MADE AVAILABLE ON STATEWIDE AT THE PACE AT WHICH ALL CAPACITY IS DEVELOPED ALL SO WITH THAT SORT OF. THING MINIMAL OF THE OF THE GOLD LET ME. ADDRESS THE QUESTIONS IN. BOTH BY THE COMMITTEE STAFF ON. FIRST BEING HOW DOES THIS RESPOND TO THE COPIOUS NINETEEN AND DUMPED ALL IN VERY LARGE PART THIS WAS MOTIVATED BY THE NEED TO REDUCE- OUR POPULATION IN SKILLED NURSING BOTH BY MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WHO COULD EXIT. ALONG WITH A STRONG BLEND OF SOCIAL CARE SERVICES LIKE I'VE JUST S. PLUS SKILLED MEDICAL CARE ALONG TO. EXIT THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES FOR NOT GO INTO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES- FOLLOWING HOSPITAL DISCHARGE OR ALL HEALTH DETERIORATION WHILE LIVING IN COMMUNITY THE GOAL OF COURSE IS TO. MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE TO BE LIVING AT HOME LIVING IN COMMUNITY PARTICIPATING FULLY ALL BUT HAVING THEIR- REAL NEEDS MET SO THAT THEY ARE SAFELY DOING SO. AMONG THE. THIS QUESTION WAS POSED TO US WOULD BUT JUST GO BACK TO THE FIRST QUESTION WHILE THAT WAS THE INITIAL BE CERTAINLY BE ORIGINATING IN THE IMPETUS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE BENEFIT. ON LONG TERM CARE HOME WILL PROVIDE THE MISSING PIECE IN THE CARE CONTINUUM DOT ON CERTAINLY THE HUMAN SERVICES. SOCIAL WORK PROFESSIONALS LONG LOOKED FOR WHICH IS YOU KNOW THE UP THE ABILITY NOT TO HAVE PEOPLE HAVE TO CHOOSE. WELL I HAVE NO CHOICE AND TO WIND UP IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY IF THAT IS NOT WHAT THEY WANT AGAIN THIS IS NOT A- IN ANY SENSE A MANDATORY PROGRAM FOR ANYONE BUT- IT WILL POVIDE. THE OPTION FOR. ALL WHO PREFER TO LIVE WITH SERVICES BROUGHT INTO THEIR HOME AND INTO THE COMMUNITY. HELLO D. R. SECOND QUESTION WAS POSED BY THE- OF THE STOCK WAS IS THIS PROPOSAL ABOUT COST CONTAINMENT THE ANSWER IS NO I MEAN IT IS. INTENDED AS I SENT TO BOTH DECOMPRESS- THE SKILLED NURSING POPULATION AT THE TIME OF AN INFECTION RATES ARE DANGEROUSLY AUDIENCEARE AND THEN YOU NO LONGER TERM TO HAVE THE- ALTERNATIVE GOING INTO. THE FUTURE. FOUR OUR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE HOICES ON IT IS OBVIOUSLY BE THE METHOD BY WHICH IS FINANCED IS. MEDIC CAL RATES FOR SKILLED NURSING CARE WHICH YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF FACILITY RANGE BETWEEN ABOUT TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY DOLLARS PER DAY TO FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DOLLARS A DAY- SO THERE'S YOU KNOW. THERE THE ABILITY TO CREATE A- PER DIEM RATE FOR LONG TERM CARE TOLL EXISTS WITHIN THAT. THE FACT THAT COST FRAMEWORK. THE THIRD QUESTION WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO ADDRESS IS THE FACT THAT THIS PROGRAM WOULD HAVE ON ALL MAJOR BASED SERVICES LIKE MSSP C. BASS C. C. T. IT'S R. O. FRANKLY THAT THERE ISN'T A DIRECT EFFECT IN. THOSE CASES- IT WAS NEVER INTENDED TO BE OF A SEA BASS OR NEMESIS P. REPLACEMENT YOU KNOW THE- TIMING IS EVERYTHING I SUPPOSE AND THE FACT THAT THE PROPOSAL EMERGED WHEN IT DID. I THINK HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED IN PEOPLE'S MINDS WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS THAT IS NOT THE ADMINISTRATION'S ATTENTION WELL. AGAIN IT'S INTENDED AS A NEW OPTION THAT NONE OF THOSE CAN FULLY SERVE TODAY. NOW IN TERMS OF WHAT I SEE IN THIS ANTICIPATE WE WILL SEE AS WE IMPLEMENT LONG TERM CARE TO ALL SHIPPING FEES. IS THAT A NUMBER pMAY ACTUALLY BE PROVIDERS IN THE LONG TERM CARE BENEFIT STRUCTURE I MEAN IF YOU THINK I MEAN CERTAINLY I OBSESS CONTINUES TO BE A- TOP PROVIDER. ON PARTICULARLY IF YOU THINK OF PROGRAMS LIKE THE PACE ORGANIZATIONS ALL WHO DO ALL ON A SMALL SCALE VERY MUCH ON WHAT LONG TERM CARE HOME IS ON THE THAT IS. ALMOST SIMPLY RICK REQUIRES ANOTHER LINE OF BUSINESS FOR THEM THE SAME I THINK IT'S TRUE OF SEA BASS ON BUT THEY ARE VERY LIKELY TO BE PROVIDERS IN IT FOR CARE COORDINATION PURPOSES. MSSP MAY HAVE A ROLE AGAIN IN EACH INSTANCE THOUGH. THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE DOING A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT LINE OF BUSINESS THAN THEY'RE DOING NOW BECAUSE THE- PARTICIPANTS COULD NOT BE IN. BOTH A WAIVER PROGRAM AND THE- STATE PLAN PROGRAM AT THE SAME TIME SO ON BUT IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH OF THE PROVIDER NETWORK SO CARAPACE OF PHOTOGRAPHY I THINK THERE'S YOU KNOW. A COMPLETE APPRECIATION OF THE FACT THAT THEY'RE THEY THEY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ROLE TO PLAY IN THIS MOVING FORWARD. THE FOURTH QUESTION WE WERE ASKED TO. ADDRESS IT. AND HIGHLIGHTED THIS MORNING IN AN OPENING REMARKS IS WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION IS WILLING TO DELAY THE PROPOSAL TO NEXT YEAR SO THAT IT CAN BE- CHARACTER WITH A POLICY BUDGET BILL PROSPECTS. ALL DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES HAS ALREADY AS YOU KNOW ALL DEBATE THE FLOW OF THE OF THE PROCESS PRECISELY SO AS TO. GET MORE ROBUST. ENGAGEMENT WITH STAKEHOLDERS CONSUMER REPRESENTATIVE GROUPS ETCETERA ALL AND THE WE FULLY INTEND TO. INCORPORATE THAT IN PUT THAT AWARENESS INTO THE- INTIMIDATED A PROGRAM DESIGNED THE BENEFIT DESIGN AS IT GOES FORWARD- WE'RE CERTAINLY. ARE YOU OPEN TO- CONTINUING TO INFORM THE LEGISLATURE CUTS OFF THE LEGISLATURE ON COME BACK IN BUDGET HEARINGS REPORT ON PROCESS ALONE INFORMED JAIL BE SEAT BEFORE THEY OF. STATE PLAN AMENDMENT IS ESTIMATED SO LONG. I'M GOING TO DEFER AUSTIN FIVE ON WHICH IS THE FISCAL- TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. CHECK A BLANK- FOR. GOOD MORNING CHAIRING COMMITTEE MEMBERS JACOB ONE PARMA FINANCEIN REGARDS TO YOUR FIFTH QUESTION ABOUT THE FISCAL ANALYSIS THE PROPOSAL I THINK DIRECTOR LIKE PORN IS NOT A GOOD JOB EXPLAINING WHAT THE GENESIS OF THE PROPOSAL WAS AND HOW IT'S AIMED AT TRANSITIONING INDIVIDUALS OUT OF A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY INTO THE COMMUNITY IDENTIFYING INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TRANSITIONING OUT OF THE HOSPITAL AND POTENTIALLY INTO A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AND INTERCEPTING INDIVIDUALS WERE IN THE COMMUNITY AND LIKELY TO END UP IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. AT THIS TIME WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC FISCAL ANALYSIS TO SHARE WITH YOU BUT BASED OFF THE TRANSITION OF INDIVIDUALS FROM SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES TO THE COMMUNITY WE THINK THAT WILL HAVE A NET SAVINGS AFFECT ON THE STATE EXPENDITURES. FOR THIS PROGRAM. WHEN WE GO TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ASK FOR APPROVAL FOR BENEFITS SUCH AS THIS WE NEED TO DEMONSTRATE COST NEUTRALITY. AND THE WAY I DESCRIBE IT WOULD SHOW THIS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT. IT IS ON AVERAGE LESS EXPENSIVE TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY THAT IS TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. OBVIOUSLY ANY SAVINGS GENERATED FROM THIS PROPOSAL WOULD NEED TO BE. WHAT HAVE TO OFFSET ANY STATE OPERATION COSTS OR COST TO PROVIDE THIS BENEFIT IN THE COMMUNITY. AS A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS CONTINUES TO DEVELOP AND THE FINAL BENEFIT DESIGN THIS PACKAGE WILL HAVE A MUCH BETTER IDEA OF WHAT THOSE POTENTIAL COSTS WOULD BE AND WHAT THOSE POTENTIAL SAVINGS WOULD BE. AGAIN THE DIFFICULT PART FOR THIS IS IDENTIFYING WHAT PORTION OF THE POPULATION IS MOVING DIRECTLY OUT OF A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY INTO THE COMMUNITY. VERSUS THE- THE COST AVOIDANCE THAT WE WHICH WHAT IS SHE FROM INDIVIDUALS MOVING OUT OF. FROM INDIVIDUALS MORE FROM THE COMMUNITY INTO A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY. SO THOSE ARE THE TYPESOF QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE LOOKING INTO RIGHT NOW I'M TRYING TO. PIN DOWN SO WE CAN HAVE A MUCH MORE SPECIFIC FISCAL ANALYSIS FOR YOU ALL AND WE WILL BE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU AS THE BENEFIT. DESIGN IS FINALIZED THROUGH THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. THANKS. SO BEING BACK TO THE MAIN QUESTIONS OF THE PROPOSED ON. FIFTY UNDERLYING QUESTION OF COURSE IS WHAT ARE THE- SHORT TERM IMMEDIATE THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE- TO HELP. ADDRESS ISSUES OF CROWDING IN FACILITIES SUTTER AND- WE SHARED WITH THE LEGISLATURE LATE LAST WEEK- DHS'S SORT OF ACTION PLAN FOR ADDRESSING THE PARTICULAR URGENCY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- AS YOU KNOW THE- SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CASES AND- JAMES CARVILLE SAID MADERA FRESNO STANISLAUS ANIMAL KINGDOM TOMORROW ON HAS BEEN A- MAJOR FOCUS OF THE ADMINISTRATION TO TRY TO ALONG I HAVE ON THE GROUND RESPONSES. ALL IN THE- PROGRAMS THAT DH CS IT HAS A RESPONSIBILITY FOR ONE WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING WITH FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS UP TO PURSUE YOU ALL ACTION ITEMS THAT LEVERAGE OUR EGGS EXISTING HOME COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. ALONG TO REDUCE AND AVOID NURSING HOME. POPULATIONS AND WHAT WHAT I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE RIGHT NOW ARE THE THINGS THAT ALONG OR WITHIN OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS ALREADY ALONG AND WITHIN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT ALL. BECAUSE WE WOULD BE APPROACHING THESE HAS ON DISASTER. THE EMERGENCY WAIVER REQUEST TO CMS WE BELIEVE WE CAN SUBMIT THEM PROBABLY HAVE. COMPLETED VERY QUICKLY ARM THE THERE ARE FOUR THINGS I'M GOING TO QUICKLY RUN THROUGH THAT WE ARE DOING THE FIRST IS ALL OF A CENTURY SETTING UP A SORT OF A RAPID RESPONSE INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ALMOST SORT OF A ROAD TO HOME IN WHICH- WE'RE WORKING WITH THE MANAGED CARE PLANS WELL AND THE H. C. B. S. ROVIDERS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES ALL TO. QUICKLY IDENTIFY PEOPLE WHO ARE IN MOVEMENT BETWEEN STAGES OF CARE TO TRY TO ENSURE ABOUT ALL TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE THE EXISTING PROGRAMS PARENT WITH THE CHANGES ALL AT THE MOMENT- CAN BE LINKED TO THEM. AVOID ALL. BLENDING IN WINDING UP IN THE S. ALL. THE NEXT OF THESE OF BEGINS PROCESS OF EXPANDING THE CAPACITY OF. EDITED BEGINS FIRST BY EXPANDING THE ABILITY OFF THE- INSTITUTIONAL TRANSITIONS TO BE RE PRIORITIZED COVERS THE ALL. OUR TIES ASIAN REQUIREMENTS THAT EXIST FOR THE- IT SHOULD BE S. R. PROVIDERS PARTICULARLY ALL THE- ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER PROGRAMS CENTER IS THAT IT MUST BE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS FOR GREATER THAN SIXTY DATES ON IN FACT THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE QUICKLY MAY BE OFFER PEOPLE WORK BUT THEY'RE SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. AND SO THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS WE WILL ALL BE MOVING ALL QUICKLY TO TRY TO DO ALL. FOR THE ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER ON. SLOT CAPACITY IS LIMITED BUT. IT IS STILL AVAILABLE I MEAN THEY'RE THE IT'S NOT EXHAUSTED- HOWEVER IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY THE WAIVER IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN FRESNO KERN AND SAN JOAQUIN SO TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF RESIDENTS AND OTHER OF CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES. WE WOULD HAVE TO. INDIVIDUALS WOULD HAVE TO BE WILLING TO SORT OF RELOCATE AND- RECEIVE THEIR SERVICES IN KAREN FRESNO STOCKTON OR OR BAKERSFIELD. ALL RIGHT THIS IS SOMETHING UP MENTION PROBABLY A COUPLE OF TIMES MORE ALONG WITH THE EXISTING- HOME COMMITTEE BASED SERVICES ON THERE ARE NOT STATEWIDE FOOTPRINTS IN ALL OF THE WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT BE. OF LONG TERM CARE HOMES IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN I PROGRAM WOULD ULTIMATELY BE STATEWIDE- BENEFIT SYSTEM. FOR THE. MSSP PROGRAM. WE'RE WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT ON AGING DIRECTOR WAIT FOLLOW ME HERE- ON THE TRUTH IDENTIFIED ON USED MSSPS LOTS OF AND OF. TO THE EXTENT THERE IS CAPACITY TO OPERATE THEM TO MOVE THOSE INTO THE HIGH IMPACT COUNTIES. ALL AND THEN WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH ALL TO PARTNER WITH THE PACE ORGANIZATIONS ARM TO GET SOME MODIFICATIONS IN THE REGULATIONS THAT GOVERN HOW THEY CAN FUNCTION ON TROOP TO ALLOW THEM TO RESPOND MORE READILY- SO. WORKING ON THE SORT OF IT. THE CONNECTION BETWEEN PACE AND OF COMMUNITY CARE TWENTY COULD. CALIFORNIA CONTINUITY TRANSITIONS ON PROGRAM WHICH OF COURSE IS THE- CORRECT. TRANSACTION SERVICES THAT CAN SUPPORT OF HOME BASED MODIFICATIONS AND- I DON'T LIKE THAT- PARTNERING WITH- TASTE TO REDUCE THE ASSISTED LIVING WAIT LIST- BY FACILITATING TARGETED MAILERS TO INDIVIDUALS ALL OF TO. WORK WITH THEM AND WITH ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES AND WORKING WITH CMS TO OBTAIN WHAT'S CALLED A BENEFITS IMPROVEMENT AND PROTECTION ACT WAIVER CURRENTLY. UNDER THE BENEFITS IMPROVEMENT PROTECTION ACT PACE ORGANIZATIONS CANNOT RECRUIT FOR CLIENTS THEY CAN'T ADVERTISE ON WHAT WE WILL BE DOING IS SEEKING A WAIVER FROM.% CMS SO THAT THE PACE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE CAPACITY CAN. B. DIRECTLY WORKING WITH HOSPITAL DISCHARGE SYSTEMS AS WELL- SKILLED NURSING OF SYSTEMS TO MOVE PEOPLE INTO THE EXISTING PACE KERA TOLD SYSTEMS OF SERVICE. WITH THAT I THINK I'LL CONCLUDE MY- RESPONSES TO THE QUESTIONS AND DOES. I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE DIRECTOR OF WADE THROUGH. TO RESPOND. THANK YOU MEMBERS AND SHARE. I THANK YOU MOST OF ALL FOR CONVENING THIS FORUM TO FOCUS ON OUR OLDEST RESIDENTS AND PEOPLE DISABILITIES WHO ARE BEARING THE BRUNT OF THE KIND OF VIRUS PANDEMIC A WE ARE VERY MINDFUL THAT THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC WORTH GRATEFUL FOR THE HEARING ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD CALL TWO WEEKS AGO AND CALL US BCK TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION. AND REALLY BROUGHT IN THE LANDS TO LOOK BOTH AT WHAT WE CAN DO WITHIN THE FOUR WALLS OF THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND I'M GLAD YOU'VE ALSO CALLED MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE PRIVATE PUBLIC HEALTH TO SPEAK TO ALL THE EFFORTS THERE WE ARE EXTRAORDINARILY MINDFUL OF THE LOSS OF LIFE THE THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED PLUS PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED IN RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. AND THE HUNDRED THIRTY PLUS- WORKERS WHO HAVE DIED AS WELL SO THIS IS TOP OF MIND FOR ALL OF US IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE STRATEGIES- A PACE UP WITHIN THE FOUR WALLS DOUBLE TALK ABOUT MORE IN THE SECOND PANEL BUT ALSO HOW DO WE KEEP PEOPLE HOME THE COMMUNITY AS THEY WISH HOW DO WE SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES. THEIR HOUSING NEEDS THEIR ISOLATION NEEDS THEIR HEALTHCARE NEEDS HAVE ALL BEEN TOP OF MIND SO I'LL SPEAK BRIEFLY TO QUESTION SIX AND SEVEN SO WE CAN THEN OPEN. THE FORM. AS I MENTIONED THE IMMEDIATE ACTIONS ON WITHIN SNIFFS OF COURSE ARE WITHIN CITY PH AND THEY WILL. SPEAK MORE TO THE INFECTION CONTROL THE ENFORCEMENT THE TESTING AND THE DATA STRATEGIES THAT THEY HAVE BEEN DEPLOYING AND CONTINUE TO DEPLOY. BUT IT'S EIGHTY EIGHT WOULD BE LOOKED UP THREE THINGS THAT WE HAVE FOCUSED ON. OF COURSE BECAUSE THE LONG TERM CARE- LET'S WE WILL ALSO HEAR FROM THE ASSOCIATION LATER TODAY. BUT OUR PRIMARY FOCUS RIGHT NOW IS ONE. CONTINUING TO RECEIVE. COMPLAINTS AND CALLS AND CONCERNS AND INVESTIGATING BY TELEPHONE AND BY VIRTUAL. A FOLLOW UP BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT AS RE ENTRY. GUIDANCE WAS ISSUED IN JUNE PROVIDING FOR SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS FOR REENTRY BUT- WE ARE ALL STRUGGLING TO GET MORE EYES AND EARS INTO THE FACILITIES AND OUR- DOCTOR EXPLORING NEW PILOTS PARTICULARLY THE CENTRAL VALLEY POSSIBLY LOS ANGELES COUNTY. TO TRY TO GET MORE OF OUR OWN BUT- AND ALLIED STAFF. INTO FACILITIES FOR EYES AND YOUR WELLNESS CHECKS ISOLATION CHECKS- WE KNOW THE VIRTUAL- IS WORKING BUT WE ALSO KNOW WE NEED TO DO MORE. ON THE SECOND THING THAT WE ARE DOING IS. A HEARING MORE FROM ALL THE EXPERTS ON CONGREGATE CARE CDA WAS. UNFORTUNATE WITH AGENCY TO CONVENE A BRIEFING IN JULY. APPLY SURELY TERRINGTON FROM UCSF AND OTHER ACADEMICS WHO HAD. PROPOSED MULTIPLE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE ADMINISTRATION. AND SINCE THEN WE'VE STARTED AWEEKLY GERIATRIC ADVISORY CIRCLE WITH UCSF AND USC EXPERTS TO. BE THAT SOUNDING BOARD TO THE ADMINISTRATION. AND WE ALSO JUST CONVENE- A GROUP OF TEN EXPERT STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTING FAMILIES. RESIDENTS STAFF AND OPERATORS I WILL BE BE CONVENING THEM AGAIN AND- AGAIN FOR THAT CONTINUED COLLABORATION PROBLEM. SOLVING IN THIS CRISIS MOMENT. AND THEN AGAIN AS YOU OF IN OTHER FORMS WE HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LIFT UP IS OUR HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. DEPARTMENT OF AGING LIKE ALL ACROSS AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN REDESIGNED TO MEET THE MOMENT. A COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES HAVE GONE REMOTE AND DOORSTEP. I'M M. S. S. P. AGAIN ON MAKING ORE PHONE CALLS ARRANGING FOR MORE DELIVERY OF MEDICINE AND DELIVERY OF FOOD- ENGAGING IN MORE ISOLATION PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. ALL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SERVICES CONTINUE AND THEN WITH THE pSPENDING EXPAND. TO MEET NEW AND DEEPER NEEDS AND LIKE EVERYONE IN THE ADMINISTRATION WHAT WE ARE WORKING STATEWIDE WE ARE ALSO FOCUSING MORE ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND OF CONVENE. ON GROUPS FROM OUR AREA AGENCIES ON AGING- BUT OUR MSSP INTERCITY BUS PROVIDERS AND CENTRAL VALLEY TO HEAR WHAT THEIR PROBLEMS ARE AND TO TRY TO. PROBLEM SOLVE WITH THEM AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THE OTHER THING I WANT TO SPEAK TO A QUESTION SEVEN ABOUT HOW WE CAN DO MORE TO ENSURE THE FOLKS ARE AGING. IN PLACE SAFELY DURING THE COVER CRISIS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER NAZARIAN SAID IF PASSED WOULD BE OPEN TO HEARING AND TALKED ABOUT THE PATCHWORK OF AGING SERVICES WHICH IS WHY THE GOVERNOR CALLED. FOR A MASTER PLAN FOR AGING IN THE EXECUTIVE ORDER LAST YEAR. THAT PATCHWORK HAS MANY MANY BRIGHT SPOTS BUT IT IS NOT A COORDINATED INTEGRATED SYSTEM. THAT WE NEED FOR THE FUTURE AND THAT WE NEED FOR THIS MOMENT. AND SO THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER AND THAT WORK CONTINUES APACE WITH HUNDREDS OF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM STAKEHOLDERS PRESENTED LAST TUESDAY'S. MEETING BUT WE'RE NOT JUST PLANNING WE'RE DOING OP PLANNING WILL NOT FEET PEOPLE AND KEEP PEOPLE SAFE RIGHT NOW SO WE ARE DOING. ON ADDITION TO ALL THE HOME COMMUNITY SERVICES WE JUST SPOKE ABOUT WERE ALSO LIFTING UP OUR WORK ON ISOLATION. AS OLDER ADULTS STAY HOME THE LONGEST I'M PROBABLY WILL BE HOME THE LONGEST- GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH. SO WITH CHECKING CAMPAIGNS POSTCARD MAILINGS WITH A. R. P. TO THE TWO MILLION PEOPLE OVER EIGHTY IN OUR STATE. THE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN FRIENDSHIP LINE TO CALL ANY TIME WHEN YOU'RE ADULTS. AND NEW ISOLATION WORK WITH DIGITAL DIVIDE THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER ON FRIDAY SPECIFICALLY CALLING OUT OLDER ADULTS. AND THE NEED TO BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIGITAL DIVIDE THERE AND AGAIN MORE CARE SPENDING GOING. SO MORE HAS BEEN HAPPENING MORE IS COMING BUT THERE'S STILL MORE TO BE DONE WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION. TODAY WITH YOU ABOUT THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DIRECTOR TO ONE OF SEE IF JACOB LAMB WHO. ANY BEFORE WE WENT TO MEMBER QUESTIONS. AND NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. DO MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS OF THIS PANEL. DOCTOR WHAT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE PANEL- APPRECIATED- I GUESS THE FIRST QUESTION I HAD WOULD BE FOR DIRECTOR LIGHTFOOT AND THAT WAS- BECAUSE I WILL BE HONEST WITH YOU IT WASN'T REALLY CLEAR US WHEN THIS BEGAN TO ROLL OUT THIS FELT LIKE THIS WAS GOING TO BE A REPLACEMENT FOR A LOT OF PROGRAMS BUT WHAT I HEARD DIRECTOR LIFE WOULD SAY WAS THAT THIS IS ANOTHER. OPTION PART LIGHT LIGHT POOR EXCUSE ME I'M SORRY I'M THINK YEAH. MY APOLOGIES DIRECTOR LIKE FOREIGN. I ANSWER LIGHT ANYTHING. HI IT'S NOT INTENDED AS A REPLACEMENT- IT AND IT WOULDN'T DO THE SAME THINGS THAT THOSE PROGRAMS ARE DOING- THE SORT OF KNOWLEDGE ON TIMELINESS PERHAPS ITS EMERGENCE BUT- I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS IS NOT INTENDED AS A REPLACEMENT FOR. THE EXISTING HOME COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT- YOU'RE STILL CONSIDERING WHETHER OR NOT TO INCLUDE THE DUAL ELIGIBLES IN THIS WITH TWO THIRDS OF MEDICAL RESEARCH SENIORS THE RECIPIENTS BEING DUAL ELIGIBLES WHERE ARE YOU IN THAT PROCESS. I THINK THAT THAT DECISION HAS BEEN TAKEN THAT WE WILL DEFINITELY BE INCLUDING THE DO A LOT OF TROUBLES- AND THE- YEAH IF IT WAS AMBIGUOUS AND VERSION TWO. ALL IT WILL BE UNAMBIGUOUS AND VERSION THREE SO THERE WILL BE A SAVINGS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DO WE GET A SHARE OF THAT. WELL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK WITH. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DEFINE HOW- THE MEDICARE. BENEFIT INTERACTS WITH OF THIS AYE AYE I HONESTLY DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER YET. SO AND THEN SO WHO IS GONNA BE PROVIDING THE SERVICES BECAUSE BY IN THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL- THERE WAS GOING TO BE A LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS AND NOW WITH THE WITH THE SPA. YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO BY PASS THAT SO I HAVE A COUPLE CONCERNS WHO'S GONNA BE BY THE SERVICES AND THEN WHERE IS THE OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT OF REGULATIONS. ON ON THOSE PEOPLE BECAUSE IF IT DOESN'T GO THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND DOESN'T GO THROUGH REGULATION- THE FEELS LIKE YOU COULD HAVE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE RIDING SERVICES WITH NO OVERSIGHT. SO CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT ONE. THE PROVIDERS THAT WE ARE ANTICIPATING BEING INVOLVED IN THIS ARE ALREADY SORT OF INCENSE LICENSED AND CREDENTIALED ALL IN. THE SPACE OF HOME HEALTH AND IN THE CASE OF THE H. BE US ALL PROGRAMS ALL. IN THEIR SPECIALITIES IN THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE. REQUIREMENT ALONG WITH THE OF COURSE LOOKING TO THE- PLANS TO PLAY THE SORT OF THE COORDINATOR. OF AN OVERSIGHT ROLE IN THE FEE FOR SERVICE ARENA THOSE BE DIRECT RELATIONSHIPS AND CONTRACTS BETWEEN DH CS AND ALL PROVIDERS IN. EACH LOCALITY THAT WERE CARRYING IT OUT. SO I GUESS AND THEN THE FINAL QUESTION IS. AND THE PART THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST VAGUE TO US IS WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS- AND YOU KNOW HOW ARE THEY GOING TO BE YOU KNOW DIFFERENT FROM WHAT'S CURRENTLY PROVIDED THROUGH- OTHER PROGRAMS. THE BENEFITS LET ME BE CLEAR OUR BLEND OF BOTH. ALL SOCIAL CARE SERVICES THAT ALL. I JUST S. AND ATTENDANT CARE ASSISTANCE WITH DAILY LIVING ALL OF ALL MODIFICATIONS THOSE SORTS OF SERVICES. WILL THE AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED MEDICAL CARE WHICH IS NOT AVAILABLE IN MOST INSTANCES CURRENTLY HAVING THE AVAILABILITY OF PHYSICIANS TO SORT OF REFER INTO THE LONG TERM CARE AT. HAS EIGHT OF. NEXT STEP SORT OF REFERRAL PROGRAM AND SO HAVING THE CARE SERVICES THEN BUNDLED FOR THAT PERSON- THERE WOULD BE AN ELEMENT OF SPECIFIC OF. CARE MANAGEMENT FORMING THAT WOULD BE PERSON CENTRED ALONG WITH IT WOULD NOT BE A SORT OF A UNIVERSAL ALL THE BACKGROUND DOCUMENT IN THE WHICH IS SORT OF THE FIRST TO DOCUMENT IN THE- COMMITTEE BINDER. ALL DESCRIBE YOUR DESCRIBES SOME OF THE- KINDS OF MEDIC SERVICES THAT WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE ALL THE ONLY SORT OF SERVICES THAT WOULD REALLY SORT OF NOT BE. FOR A MEDICAL PERSPECTIVE ALL. INCLUDED WITHIN THE PACKAGE WOULD BE HOSPICE SERVICES IF. AND IF SORT OF. END OF LIFE PLANNING WAS OCCURRING THEN THE HOSPICE BENEFIT WOULD REPLACE THE LONG TERM CARE HOME AND BUT THE EXPECTATION OF THE SYSTEM THE COMBINATION OF SERVICES UNDER. A LONG TERM CARE AT HOME BOTH ENABLE LIVING AT HOME. BUT ALSO NOT NOT JUST WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO BE CAPTIVE PORTAL- THE GOAL IS TO HAVE THE KINDS OF SERVICES THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO PARTICIPATE IN COMMUNITY HOME IS WHERE THEY WILL RECEIVE. CARE BUT COMMUNITIES WHERE HOPEFULLY THERE WITH LIPS. AND I APOLOGIZE I DID HAVE ONE FINAL FINAL QUESTION AND THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE THIS THIS IS HELPFUL I AM CURIOUS YOU YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR COMMENTS THAT YOU. YOU KNOW YOU'RE WILLING TO INFORM AND CONSULT WITH THE LEGISLATURE. SO WE'RE GETTING INFORMATION BUT I'M NOT FEELING THE CONSULTATION PART OF IT QUITE FRANKLY- AND- AND THE INFORMATION. YOU KNOW HEADS TO DATE HAS BEEN MORE. ABOUT US PRODDING IN ASKING FOR IT RATHER THAN IT BEING NECESSARILY YOU KNOW. FORTHCOMING AND SO THERE ANALYZE PART OF THE PROBLEM. A HUGE PART OF THE PROBLEM FOR US. BECAUSE WHEN THE ORIGINALLY WE HEARD ABOUT THE PROPOSAL. IT WAS A ALMOST A MONTH BEFORE LANGUAGE CAME OUT- ON JUNE TWELFTH. THAT LANGUAGE HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE HAS BEEN WITHDRAWN WE'VE GONE THROUGH VARIOUS ITERATIONS. AND I GUESS WHAT. YOU KNOW WHAT WE- WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE REACTING AND NOT A PART OF THE PROCESS YET. THIS IS A HUGE ISSUE FOR US IN THE LEGISLATURE AND- SO WHAT IS. YOUR VISION OF INFORM AND CONSULT. BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT VISION BASED ON WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW. WELL LET ME BEGIN BY- SORT OF. OBSERVING THAT AT THE TIME THAT THE BENEFIT WAS BEING DISCUSSED DESIGNED WITH AND INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE I WAS HERE BUT I CAUGHT UP ON THE HISTORY ON IT THERE WAS A REAL SENSE OF URGENCY TO. MOVES QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE GIVEN THE- INSPECTION RATES IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND STATE AND SO IF IN FACT. URGENCY THERE WAS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION OR A LACK OF OPEN STREAMS ALL IT CERTAINLY NO ONE TOOK TIME TO TALK TO KEEP PEOPLE IN THE DARK. AND NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE I'M HERE BUT I THINK IT'S THE DEPARTMENT'S COMMITMENT NEW CONSTRUCTION COMMITMENT TO CONSULT HOUSE WIDELY COMPLETELY AND FULLY WITH EVERYONE. AS POSSIBLE AND OBVIOUSLY DEFINITELY INCLUDES ALL OF THE INTERESTED LEGISLATORS. ON THE- AT AT THE SAME SAME. ALL THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WE HAVE DO TO MOVE THIS INTO BEING A- NOT KNOWING WHETHER IT IS A PHYSICAL. FAST AND HAVING FOR DISCIPLINE BENEFIT WELL IS IT IS IT IS IN OUR HOUSE AND THE- IF ONE LOOKS SORT OF THE LIST OF THE STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AND- CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE ALREADY OCCURRED. AND THE- I MEAN FOR THE NEXT THREE OR FOUR MONTHS OF IT IT IS. ONE THREE- THERE'S A BILL HE WORKED ON AND CERTAINLY THROUGHOUT ALL OF THAT WE WILL BE SHARING ALL SORT OF GENERATIONS OF DOCUMENTS AND THEY WILL CHANGE I WANT TO EMPHASIZE TO SOME EXTENT THERE'S BEEN A BIT OF CRITICISM OVER THAT CHANGED. BUT THAT'S WHAT CONSULTING DOT COM IT. IT THIS CHANGE THE DEPARTMENT IS BY ALL. OF MUCH ANY RACING THOSE TO. ALL THERE. THAT WILL CONTINUE I HATE IT IF WE'RE POINT WHERE WE THINK WE HAVE A FEASIBLE. OF BETTER DECIDE THEN PERHAPS OKAY SERVE REPORTED OUT ALONE AND OF NOTIFY THE LEGISLATION THE LEGISLATURE UNANSWERED QUESTIONS PEOPLE HAVE. SIX AUSTIN POLICE TO HAPPEN. THANK YOU. KERN IS THERE M. FOLLOWED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MAP. THANK YOU SIR MISTER CHAIR- THANK YOU FOR THE LAST LINE OF QUESTIONING I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP A LITTLE BIT GIVEN THE QUESTION THE LAST QUESTION. DOCTOR WHAT HAD ON OVERSIGHT AND CONSULTATION. THE LANGUAGE GIVES THE DEPARTMENT DO THIRTY TO MODIFY ANY REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIED TO THE EXTENT IT DEEMS NECESSARY SO HOW WILL THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE OVERSIGHT. IN IN. GIVEN THE CONSULTATION ASPECT OF WANTING TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS. IT THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE. AS I SAID WE WILL BE COMMUNICATING SOLELY COMPLETELY IS CONSTANTLY AS POSSIBLE IN. OKAY IN COURT CONCERNS WILL BE ADDRESSED COMPLETELY ALL TOOK TOOK TO THE NTH DEGREE- SO I THAT'S I WOULD I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IN SOME OF THE LEGISLATURE WILL WILL INFORM THE OVERSIGHT THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OF THEM UNDER THE MEDICAID PLAN. OKAY OKAY SO. WE'LL COME BACK TO THAT AT SOME POINT AT NOW GOING BACK TO A COMMENT YOU HAD MADE EARLIER ABOUT THE NEED TO REDUCE NUMBERS AND SNAPS AND THAT THIS WAS OF URGENT MATTER. THAT WE ADDRESS. IT SEEMS THAT AND I WANTED I WAS GONNA SAY I FEEL BUT IT ALSO SEEMS I. THINK MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES WOULD AGREE THAT IF WE WERE GONNA TAKE URGENT STEPS FORWARD ONE OF THE THINGS WE WOULD TRY TO IMPLEMENT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WAS THE TESTING OF THE STAFF AT. SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. DURING THE HEARING FROM SEVERAL WEEKS AGO THAT THE PROPOSAL WAS THAT IT WOULD BE A CERTAIN SEGMENT OF EMPLOYEES EVERY CERTAIN NUMBER OF WEEKS AGO I THINK IT WAS EVERY OTHER WEEK. OR MAYBE IT WAS EVEN MONTHLY. AND A- WHERE ARE WE WITH THAT. B. UP WHY IS IT. WHY IS THE RATE OF FREQUENCY SO OF LOW MILEAGE WISE AND IT ON A WEEKLY BASIS WISE AND IT WEEKLY BASIS OF ALL STAFF. C. WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF DELAYS NOW. AND WHY ARE IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES STAFF AT THE LEVEL OF IMPORTANCE AND RAPID RESPONDING TO TESTING AS HOSPITAL STAFF. FOR CHERNOW'S ARE AND WORK WITH RESPECT OR COULD I ACTUALLY HAVE TO THE FOR A RESPONSE TO OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WELL IT THIS IS NOT WITHIN THE AMBIT OF BOTH THE DEPARTURE HEALTHCARE. IS. OKAY THEY'LL DENTAL OKAY YOU'RE RIGHT I WILL- I'LL COME BACK ON THIS QUESTION LATER ON IT JUST AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. FOCUSING ON NUMBERS AND REDUCING THE INDIVIDUALS AND SNIFFS I JUST WOULD THINK THAT THE FIRST THING THAT WE WOULD DO AND SNIFFS WOULD BE TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF HOW. SNIFFS WERE CONTAMINATED IN THE FIRST PLACE WE KNOW THAT IT WAS EMPLOYEES. AND SO WHY AVEN'T WE BEEN MORE AGGRESSIVE IN TESTING THE EMPLOYEES BUT- BUT THAT'S TRUE I NEED TO ASK THIS QUESTION- THE REITERATE THIS QUESTION LATER ON AS WELL. YEAH. I WOULD DIRECTOR WADE WANNA STEP IN AND RESPOND TO THAT. LET ME DEFERRED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER NAZARIAN I WOULD ONLY ASSURE THAT THAT HAS THE ISSUE OF TESTING AND SNIFF TEST IS A TOP PRIORITY AND HAS COME TO US FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE GERIATRICIANS AND I DO THINK THAT THE DIRECTOR SIGNED OF COURSE THE BEST ONE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND SHE IS HERE FOR THE SECOND PANEL OUT SECOND TOPIC FOR THE PANEL WHEN YOU'RE READY. OKAY IF SHE'S THERE NOW SHE CAN ANSWER IT NOW INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR THE PANEL PRESENTATION. WE WILL ASK HER TO COME TO THE FRONT MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU DON'T MIND ME TAKING THINGS OUT OF ORDER. ALL RIGHT. BUT LATER ON IT JUST AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT. FOCUSING ON NUMBERS AND REDUCING. THAT I COULD WE THINK THAT THE FIRST pTHING THAT WE WOULD DO. NEXT WOULD BE. ACTUALLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF HOW. IF WORKING IN THE FIRST PLACE. WE KNOW THAT IT WAS. SO WHY THE MOST INTEGRITY OF BUT- HI GOOD. THE I'M HEIDI STEIN OCCUR EVERY DRAW OF THE CAL DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC AND- EVEN THOUGH. I WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR MORE QUESTIONS ON ME AND PRESENTATION REGARDING SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I RECEIVED- I WILL GO AHEAD IN ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE DONE AT THIS POINT AT THE HEARING AS WELL. SHOULD I BELIEVE THAT THAT J. REPEAT THE QUESTION OR- I KNOW THAT'S OKAY IF I CAN BY MAY I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN IS AROUND TIME THE FREQUENCY OF TESTING THE PRIORITIZATION OF TESTING PARTICULARLY IN SKILLED NURSING HOMES- WE HAVE- SENSE- BUT MAY WE ASK THAT ALL. AND SNIFFS TO THEIR BASELINE TESTING THEY SUBMITTED THEIR BASELINE TESTING SO ALL SNIFFS DID- TEST ALL RESIDENTS AND STAFF INTO THEIR BASELINE TESTING. AND ALL OF THOSE WE HAD ABOUT TWO POINT 9% OF BASELINE TESTING OF THE HEALTH CARE WORKERS WERE POSITIVE AND ABOUT 7% OF THE RESIDENTS WERE POSITIVE BASED OFF OF THE BASELINE TESTING. IT WAS A FACILITY THAT HAD A SINGLE POSITIVE THEN THEY WENT INTO WHAT'S CALLED RESPONSE TESTING WHERE THEY DO RESPONSE TESTING EVERY WEEK THEY TEST ALL OF THEIR NEGATIVES IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO COPE PART BECAUSE OF COURSE THE KEY WHAT TESTING ISN'T THE ACTUAL TEST ITSELF SINCE THAT'S A POINT IN TIME. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF THAT TEST IS THAT YOU HAVE THE RESULTS AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO ACTION ON THEM AND TO BE ABLE TO COHORT PROPERLY WITHIN A FACILITY. UP THEN IF YOU WERE A FACILITY WHO HAD ZERO HOSTAS YOU HAD BOTH FOR YOUR PRESENCE AND YOUR STAFF YOU WENT INTO WHAT'S CALLED SURVEILLANCE TESTING WHERE WE TEST- 25% OF THE HEALTH CARE WORKERS EVERY. WEEK AND SO YOU'RE YOU'RE CONSTANTLY HAVING THAT CADENCE OF- OF RESPONSE TENSING IRK SURVEILLANCE TESTING WEEKLY- AND THAT WAS BASED OFF OF- SOME OF OUR AND OUR EXPERT GUIDANCE FROM OUR INFECTION CONTROL TEAMS ON WHAT WOULD BE THE PROPER CADENCE FOR- FOR SURVEILLANCE TESTING- AND WE DO KNOW THAT THERE HAVE BEEN- IN THE PAST WHEN WE UPPED THAT AMOUNT OF TESTING IN THE TATE. THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH HAVING ENOUGH- THREE ANTIGENS THERE IS ENOUGH ISSUE WITH HAVING TESTING KIT SUPPLIES AND- SWAPS AT SOME POINT WHICH. IS WHY WE WERE SEEING SOME DELAYS WE WERE. ON THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH WORKING IN HAND WITH THE GOVERNOR'S TESTING TASK FORCE- HOME SOME OF OUR STAFF SERVE ON THAT IN THAT CAPACITY- SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE TESTING TASK FORCE TO ENSURE THAT- THEY'RE CONSTANTLY ADDING. MORE ADDITIONAL OPTIONS FOR TESTING- AS WELL AS MORE LABS WE DO HAVE A TESTING TASK FORCE WEBSITE THE LAB LIST IT'S CONSTANTLY BEING UPDATED. TO MATCH THE INFORMATION THAT'S NEEDED TO BE ABLE TO MATCH FACILITY. WITH THOSE LABS WE KEEP ON STRESSING TO LAB TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE GOING BEYOND JUST YOUR REGION OR YOUR COUNTY. AND LOOKING AT OTHER PRIVATE LABS OR OTHER OPTIONS BECAUSE WE FOUND THAT THERE ARE SOME LABS. THAT REALLY WERE BEING UNDER UTILIZED AND HAD A LOT OF CAPACITY STILL- BUT THEY MIGHT BE IN A FARTHER DISTANCE SPACE WE'VE NOW ADDED. THANK YOU SENATOR SO THAT THEY CAN BE ABLE TO KNOW HOW MANY THANK YOU. LET ME LET ME LET ME GET TO THE HEART OF THE ISSUE AGAIN. RIGHT NOW OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES DO THEY FALL DOES THEIR TESTING FALL WITHIN THE SAME TRACK. OF EXPEDITED RESPONSE AS HOSPITALS DO. SO THEY ARE ASKED TO BE PRIORITIZED ARE HELL ARE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE ASKED TO BE PRIORITIZED AND I DO KNOW THAT THE TESTING TASK FORCE DID RECENTLY RELEASE NEW- PRIORITIZE ATION GUIDELINES. AND I BELIEVE THAT THEY HAD PLACED HOSPITAL- THEN SKILLED NURSING FACILITY THAN OTHER TYPES OF COMMUNITY AND WHETHER WAS A SYMPTOMATIC SYMPTOMATIC SPRATT- SO THERE IS NEW TESTING GUIDANCE AND PRIVATIZATION BUT THEY ARE PRIORITIZED AND WE'RE ASKING. LAPS TO PRIORITIZE THOSE TESTS TO GIVEN THE URGENCY OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN AND SKILLED NURSINGFACILITIES AND I APOLOGIZE MISTER CHAIR I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND ME- WHY WOULD. THE TESTING AND SNIFFS NOT BE A PRIORITY RIGHT NOW. WHY IS IT. I WOULD ASSUME AGAIN GOING BACK TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT THE LEVEL OF URGENCY. AND WE'RE URGENTLY TRYING TO PUT TOGETHER A WHOLE NEW PROGRAM HERE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ACTUALLY ADDRESSING WHAT'S KILLING PEOPLE. RIGHT NOW THE TESTING IS STILL NOT THE PRIORITY THAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND WE DISCUSSED ABOUT THIS JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO. SO WHY IS IT NOT EVEN ABOVE AND BEYOND WHERE HOSPITALS ARE BEING RANKED RIGHT PRIOR TASTE RIGHT NOW. SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT BUT I WILL TAKE THAT INFORMATION BACK TO THE TESTING TASK FORCE. ABOUT THAT PRIORITIZATION NO BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU TAKING SOMETHING BACK THIS IS ABOUT THE LEADERSHIP THAT E NEED TO PROVIDE. AS AN ADMINISTRATION AND AS ELECTED OFFICIALS. AGAIN I DO NOT HAVE THE- THEY DID NOT PROVIDE INPUT INTO THAT DOCUMENT I DO NOT- BUT I CAN DEFINITELY TAKE THAT INFORMATION BACK TO THE TESTING TASK FORCE WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT PRIORITIZATION LIST BUT I DO KNOW THAT ARE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE- RIGHT UP AT THE TOP AND THEY ARE NOT- CURRENTLY YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT WHEN I LOOKED AT THAT LAST DOCUMENT LAST YEAR ABSOLUTE RIGHT THAT GENERAL Q. CARE HOSPITAL- STAFF ARE LISTED ON ONE. OF HIS FIRST AND SKILLED NURSING ONE WAS SECOND ON THAT LIST- BUT I WILL DEFINITELY TAKE THAT INFORMATION BACK TO SO LITERALLY TWO MONTHS AFTE WE'VE HAD OUR FIRST HEARING. THE RESPONSE WE'RE GETTING IS THAT SNIFFS TESTING IS STILL. SECOND RANKED EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE PRODUCED OVER 40% OF THE DEATHS DURING THIS PANDEMIC. TITISEE YES THAT THAT ISN'T IT. WELL I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I CAN SAY AT THIS POINT- WHAT WE CAN SAYWHAT YOU CAN SEE IS THAT. WE HEARD THE LEGISLATURE AND WE'RE GOING TO PRIORITIZE IT. SO THAT BY THE THIRD HEARING WE HAVE AND I DO HOPE THAT ALL OF OUR CHURCH TOGETHER. COME TOGETHER AND WE HAVE A THIRD HEARING MAYBE IN SEPTEMBER. MAYBE IN OCTOBER IT SEEMS LIKE WE NEED TO DO IT ON A MONTHLY BASIS. TO PLACE A CERTAIN LEVEL OF FIRE BEHIND EVERYONE SO THAT WE CAN GET TO THE RESULT THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR. TO THE RIGHT ANSWER WOULD BE YES THIS IS A PRIORITY AND WE ARE URGENTLY MAKING SURE THAT THE TESTING IS HAPPENING. THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO HEAR THAT I THINK THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR. ABSOLUTELY HERE THAT ABSOLUTELY FREE WITH THAT AND AGAIN I WILL TAKE THAT BACK TO THE TESTING TASK FORCE WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING. THOSE CHOICES AND I WILL DEFINITELY LETTER ADMINISTRATION NO- I THINK OBVIOUSLY SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE A HUGE PRIORITY AND WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS EVIDENT IN ALL OF OUR DOCUMENTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. WITH THE FOLLOW UP WE HAVE CHURTON. I DO AND I APOLOGIZE I WANNA LIVE IN THIRTY MINUTES IN THE STOMACH OR ONE- BUT BEFORE YOU LEAVE. QUICK FOLLOW UP THERE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE DIRECTORS- EITHER THERE WAS AN ARTICLE IN THE BE- TALKING ABOUT THE I BELIEVE YOU HAVE A STRIKE TEAM THAT VISITS THE FACILITIES- WHEN THERE ARE SITUATIONS IS THAT CORRECT AND I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE UNDER YOUR EMPLOYEE OR THEY'RE UNDER. DIRECTOR WAITING FOR YOU. I'D I BELIEVE THE STRIKE TEAMS REFERRING TO OUR INFECTION CONTROL OUR HAI STRIKE TEAMS AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE. OUR AND SURVEYORS ARE LICENSE AND CERTIFICATION SURVEYORS I HAVE BEEN OUT OF FACILITIES- SO. YES THAT THAT IS UNDER- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH GOT IT. THE ORDER ARTICLE MENTIONED THAT- DID THE STAFF THAT. DOES THE SITE VISITS DOESN'T. GET TESTED IS HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED. YES SO WE DO TEST OUR STAFF- WE ACTUALLY SUBMITTED THE SAME WEEK THAT WE SUBMITTED TO THE- ALL FACILITIES LETTER TO ALL OF THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THE FIRST WEEK OF JUNE. THAT REQUESTED- OR THAT SET OUT THE TESTING PLAN FOR ALL OF OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WITH THE SAME WEEK THAT WE SUBMITTED- ARE TESTING STRATEGY THAT MERE STAFFER OWN STAFF THROUGH OUR CAL HR PROCESSES. I DID TAKE SOME DELAY THROUGH OUR REGULAR HR BARGAINING UNIT AND LABOR PROCESSES BUT WE WERE ABLE TO COMPLETE THAT POLICY THAT REQUIRES ALL OF OUR STAFF TO DO THAT SEEM TESTING KIT. SO HOW OFTEN ARE THEY GETTING TESTED NOW. SO ALL OF OUR STAFF HAVE TO BE TESTED- THE SAME CADENCE WHICH IS THAT 25% EVERY WEEK- AND- WE DO HAVE- OBVIOUSLY THERE AT THE OTHER STATE HEALTH INSURANCE BUT THEN WE ALSO- HAVE CONTRACTED WITH OTHER- TESTING LABS AS WELL TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO TESTING. GAGAN IT SO THEN IF THEY IF THEY TEST POSITIVE THEN THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO VISIT THE FACILITIES. THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY THANK YOU. HI I JUST I JUST HAD- SOME FOLLOW UP WITH DIRECTOR LIKE PORN. IT'S GOOD TO SEE AGAIN DIRECTOR CAN CAN YOU JUST REFRESH THE COMMITTEES- MEMORY I KNOW YOU'RE NEW TO THIS POSITION BUT HOW LONG YOU'VE BEEN WORKING. FOR THE STATE AS HEAD OF D. E. S. S. WELL I WAS THERE FOR. EIGHT YEARS BOTH OF. JONES TURNS ME ON THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT I DON'T. YOU ARE YOU YOU SAID YOU ARM FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE HISTORY AROUND THE LONG TERM CARE. AT HOME THE PROPOSAL SO LAW YOU WEREN'T INVOLVED- WITH THAT- YOU YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH. YEAH SO WHAT POINT WAS THE YOU YOU GET A MY COLLEAGUE DR WOULD MENTION THE SORT OF A LACK OF. CONSULTATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE WHICH YOU- SAID IF IT IF AT ANY POINT WAS ACCIDENTAL- BUT I GUESS EVEN AFTER THE POINT WAS MADE. THERE HAS BEEN NO- NO DISCUSSION OR REALLY NO PROPOSAL TO COME FORWARD TO ACTUALLY NOT JUST CONSULT WITH THE LEGISLATURE BUT TO REALLY WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO CRAFT A PROPOSAL IS THAT. CORRECT. HE BOTH THE SORT OF ORIGINAL WHAT I'M HER FRIEND WAS VERSION OF ONE OF PROGRAM DESIGN WAS SHARED WITH ALL. STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING YOU KNOW LEGISLATIVE STAFF- VERSION TWO DOCUMENT BY THAT POINT I KNEW I WAS ON BOARD AND MEMBER I'M SORRY I GUESS I WAS SAYING LEGISLATE TORS. SO I MEAN I MEAN THIS IS YOUR FIRST TIME AT A- BUDGET HEARING IN RECENT HISTORY BUT- I TRIED TO- THE PUBLIC LOOKS AT LEGISLATORS DIFFERENTLY THAN LEGISLATIVE STAFF. SO WHEN WE SAY LEGISLATIVE CONSULTATION I DON'T. UNTIL YOU'VE CONSULTED ME I DON'T REALLY COUNT MY STAFF BUT OTHER PEOPLE OTHER LEVEL OF THE LEGISLATURE SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. BUT AT LEAST FOR ME. I'M STILL WAITING FOR MY CALL. ALL RIGHT. WHAT WAS GOING TO SAY IT'S IRONIC BECAUSE FREQUENTLY WHEN THE STUFFS BECAUSE THEY SAY ON BEHALF OF OUR MEMBER BUT- LET'S NOT GO THERE- NO I TO SPEAK FOR MYSELF SO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I THINK YOU CAN ASK ME TO GREAT I'D BE HAPPY TO COME BY AND- WHAT DO YOU THROUGH THE DETAILS AS WE GO THROUGH VERSION TWO VERSION THREE VERSION FOR BECAUSE I DIDN'T NOTICES THERE WAS. YOU WHEN YOU MENTION. STAKEHOLDERS I DIDN'T HEAR ANY. LEGISLATOR INVOLVED IN THAT STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT WHAT STAKEHOLDERS ARE INVITED. THE LARGE LARGELY THE- POPULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE- FORMAL MEETINGS HAVE BEEN A LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS COMMITTEE OF THE MASTER PLAN ON AGING IF SERVED IN AN EXPANDED WAY BECAUSE AT THE LAST CALLED WE DID I THINK WE HAD THREE HUNDRED OR FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE ON THE LINE. THIS WAS MY RECOLLECTION INCLUDING- ADVOCACY GROUPS ALL LATER ALL. THE OF PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS THAT CENTER- IF YOU IF ANY MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO BE INCLUDED ON THE ACT OF CALL GROUP I'D HAPPILY DO SO BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I OFFERED THAT TO. BE HAPPY TO SEE MYSELF IN THE MEDICAID DIRECTOR WHO UNFORTUNATELY IS OUT OF TOWN TO THE STATE TODAY LONG AND CAN SPEAK MUCH FOR ELOQUENTLY TO THIS- BUT WE'D BE HAPPY TO COME AND MEET WITH ANY OF INTERESTED PARTIES IN THE LEGISLATURE AND I TAKE THE DIFFERENCE LEGISLATE TORE. VERSUS STOP. SO I THINK YOU WOULD YOU FROM FROM MY COLLEAGUE DR WHAT EARLIER THAT THEY WERE JUST- YOU KNOW NOT ONLY HAS THERE NOT BEEN ENGAGEMENT THAT THAT THERE'S BEEN ONLY INVOLVEMENT WHEN WE'VE SORT OF ASKED TO BE INVOLVED. ALSO AS VICE CHAIR OF. THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE I WOULD JUST. CAUTION YOU USING THAT PROCESS THAT PROCESS IS REALLY MEANT FOR- WHAT I WOULD SAY VERY TECHNICAL CHANGES TO- CURRENT BUDGET AUGMENTATIONS AS YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS. THERE WAS NO BUDGET PROPOSAL THERE WAS NO. TRAILER BILL THERE IS NO- LANGUAGE- THIS IS STILL- IT'S A IT'S A PROPOSAL BUT IT'S NOT A- WHAT I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT A- TRADITIONAL STATE PROPOSAL AS AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE. IF SOMETHINGS ARE A REAL PROPOSAL WE SEE IT IN TRAILER BILL OR RECEIPT IN LEGISLATIVE LANGUAGE INCIDENT THE LEGISLATIVE BILL. TO BE DELIBERATED BY THE PUBLIC TO BE- VIEWED AND DISCUSSED BY OUR CONSTITUENTS AND TO REALLY HAVE A- ROBUST PUBLIC PROCESS AND I THINK THAT. I THINK IS THAT IS SORT OF WHAT'S LACKING AT THIS POINT IN MY OPINION. HISTORICALLY AND TRADITIONALLY- CHARTING ALONG WITH HIM THE- STATE MEDICAID PLAN. THE PROCESS OF- CONSULTATION HAS BEEN A LONG BOTH OF. ORGANIZED BY THE DEPARTMENT WITH KNOWN INTERESTED PARTIES ANYONE WHO EXPRESSES INTEREST WE HAVE A STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR THE WHOLE DEPARTMENT THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STAKEHOLDER VISOR COMMITTEE FOR LONG TERM CARE HOME GOT A STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEE ALL. WHEN A PLAN WHAT A PLAN AMENDMENT DESIGN IS. AT THE POINT WHERE THE DEPARTMENT FEELS IT IS IMPLEMENTABLE IT IS THEN POSTED FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON IT IT IS WHAT THE DOCTOR IS A REQUIRED PART OF THE C. S. PROCESS. ALONG AND HOWEVER THE- IF THERE IS NO STATUTE NEEDED TO IMPLEMENT. THEN THE PRACTICES BETTER SO LONG AS IT IS. OPERATING WITH IN THE BUDGET CONSTRAINTS THAT ALREADY ADOPTED THAT THE DEPARTMENT PROCEEDS OBVIOUSLY WITH GUIDANCE FROM AGES FROM THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE ALL ADD IN CONSULTATION WITH. ALL INTERESTED PARTIES THE DEPARTMENT PROCEEDS- TO IMPLEMENT ALL THE PRODUCT OF THE BENEFITS HAVE BEEN CHANGED NUMEROUS TIMES HELLO IN THIS WAY- THIS IS UNUSUAL. ARE EXCEPT THAT THIS IS UNUSUAL AND IT IS UNUSUAL BECAUSE FOR SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE THE LINKED IN OUR MINDS WITH OTHER PROGRAMS AND THIS OVER FOR TO PUT DIRECTOR LET'S JUST BECAUSE I MEAN. LET'S NOTLUMP ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER. RIGHT I MEAN YOU ARE LOOK I THINK WE YOU ARE DISCUSSING IN GENERAL IN MY OPINION AND ALL DISTRICT RESIDENTS WE ARE ARE FAIRLY TECHNICAL CHANGES THAT I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. WHICH IS VERY GOOD AND WE THINK FOR THE MOST PART IT WORKS BUT THIS TYPE OF CHANGE IS A FAIRLY LARGE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. AND I THINK EVEN AFTER THERE WAS LEGISLATIVE CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED IN IN MY OPINION THIS IS JUST ONE ONE LEGISLATORS OPINION. THAT THAT CONCERN WAS IGNORED- AND WAS LARGELY DISMISSED AND EVEN IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS. IT WAS DISMISSED THE SENSE THAT YOU SAID THE WAY YOU WERE GOING TO INFORM THE LEGISLATURE WAS A LETTER. TO JAIL BC. IT AND AGAIN THAT IS NOT THE PROCESS WHEN THERE WAS A MAJOR MAJOR CHANGE. USUALLY WHEN THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE THE PROCESS EITHER GOES THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS OR IT GOES THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. THIS IS NOT EXCUSE GIVE ME I'M NOT DONE. IT'S NOT DONE IN SECRET IT IS NOT DONE WITHOUT PUBLIC INPUT AND I THINK YOU WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM. MYSELF AND THE NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES IS THE CONCERN OF REALLY WHAT YOUR INTENTION IS AROUND THIS PROCESS AND RELEASE CIRCUMVENT LEGISLATURE. YOU'LL RECALL CHARGING THAT WHAT I SAID AT THE OUTSET OF WAS WE WOULD ARM BE HAPPY TO REPORT OUT THE BRIEF- IN BUDGET HEARINGS. AFTER THE GENTLEMAN BUDGET- AND THEN PRIOR TO SUBMISSION. OF A STATE PLAN AMENDMENT IF IT WOULD BE. OF ANY SORT OF USE OR VALUE BECAUSE YOU KNOW NOTIFY GENTLY SEE IF IT'S AND IF THAT'S NOT NEEDED FIVE. DOT COM THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO EVADE I MEAN THIS IS NOT BEEN CARRIED OUT SECRET THIS IS THE MOST PUBLIC SECRET I'VE EVER SEEN- THE- WHAT WHAT IF WE'RE GOING TO PURSUE THIS IT IS AN ENORMOUS LEFT AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF WORK THAT HAS TO TAKE PLACE OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. THAT REALITY IF WHAT I CHARACTER COULD THAT SORT OF WORK. ON A POSSIBLE THAT AT SOME FUTURE POINT. THERE MAY BE IT MAY BE PROVED BASED ON WHAT HAPPENS TO SOME OTHER PROGRAM. CENTRALLY WHAT THE LANGUAGE THAT CAME OVER. ALL FROM BUDGET STAFF IMPLIED. I CAN'T DO THAT I MEAN IF YOU KNOW. WE CAN'T WE CAN'T COMMIT THAT SORT OF RESOURCE. WHAT WHAT ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES DID WANT ME TO ASK YOU FAR FAR- STAFF COULD BE PART OF THAT WORKING PROCESS BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME. DISCUSSION BUT THEY HAVE NOT REALLY BEEN A DIRECTLY INVOLVED. ABSOLUTELY AND I FRANKLY THOUGHT THAT I HAD HEARD THEM ON SOME OF THE CALLS BUT IF THE PROBLEM WRONG MY DAD AND WE WILL DEFINITELY. THANK YOU- WERE. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS AGAIN. PERHAPS YOU FEEL LIKE THIS HAS BEEN A FAIRLY PUBLIC PROCESS BUT THERE IS ONE BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT THAT IS DISAGREEING WITH YOU. SO I THINK LET'S JUST REITERATE THAT AT THAT PERHAPS IT'S A MATTER OF PERCEPTION. BUT AGAIN IN IN THIS IN THIS ROUND WE OFTEN KNOW THAT PERCEPTION IS REALITY. JUST A QUICK QUESTION BECAUSE I AFTER- APOLOGIZE I'VE TO GO TO A MEETING YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT. DATE DH CS ACTION PLAN OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN WRITING BECAUSE I KNOW THAT. THERE WAS A PHONEOUR STAFF BUT WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING IN WRITING. HI FORGIVE ME I THOUGHT THAT AGENCY CENTERED OVER. ON FRIDAY THURSDAY OR FRIDAY YEAH WE WILL GO AND DOUBLE CHECK THAT BUT OKAY BUT IF FOR ANY REASON IT WASN'T MY APOLOGIES AND WE'RE WE WILL RESET IT BUT NO IT. I BELIEVE IT WAS SENT. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. SOMANY- QUESTIONS THE TO GO OFF OF BUT I THINK I'LL PICK UP WHERE. MR TING LEFT OFF. DIRECTOR LABOR AND THAT'S CORRECT LATE ONE YES- YOU YOU DO STATED THAT- HISTORICALLY. THAT IF THERE'S NOT A STATUE YOU WON'T INFORM US AND AS NOTED EARLIER BY MY COLLEAGUE- MISTER NAZARIAN- UNDER THE CURRENT PROPOSAL THERE ISN'T A STATUTE. THAT REQUIRES YOU ALL TO BRING THAT INFORMATION BACK TO THE LEGISLATIVE BODY AND I THINK GAS. PART OF THE PROBLEM. THAT THE LEGISLATIVE BODY IS HAVING AS STATED BY. SHARE TíNH IS THAT. WE ARE BEING CONSULTED ON BUT YET WHERE THE BODY THAT IS DESIGNED TO MAKE PUBLIC POLICY AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE. IS POLICY BEING DONE BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH THROUGH THE BUDGET WITH MECHANISMS PUT IN PLACE WHERE THERE ARE NO STATUTES TO THEN BRING THAT POLICY BACK. THROUGH A POLICY COMMITTEE HEARING PROCESS SO WALL YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO POST THE INFORMATION PUBLICLY ANNOUNCE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WE'RE COMPLETELY GOING AROUND THAT PUBLIC PROCESS THROUGH THE POLICY HEARINGS IN HAVING TESTIMONY HAVING. COMMUNITIES AND PUBLIC BE ABLE TO COMMAND HEARING ALL SIDES IN HAVING OPEN DISCUSSIONS. LAW WHICH IS A HUGE PART OF WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE BODIES DESIGNED TO DO. SO IT AGAIN IS. SHARE TEAM JUST STATED YOU KNOW I KNOW I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE IN. THE FRANKLY I'D LIKE TO REMIND YOURSELF AND THE. EXECUTIVE BRANCHES IN THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THERE ARE. TWO PARTIES HERE IN SACRAMENTO EVEN THOUGH THERE MIGHT BE A MAKE A MAJORITY BUT- THE VICE CHAIRS IN THE REPUBLICAN CAUCUS AND ALSO HAS INPUT AS WELL. AND YOU KNOW REALLY. THIS HASN'T BEEN PUBLIC WE DON'T NEED CONSULTED TO. OUR FRANKLY WE ARE THE POLICY MAKERS AND- A I BELIEVE THAT'S THE MAJOR FRUSTRATION HERE SIR IS THAT. INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH A SHARING PROCESS WHERE WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER COMMUTATIVE. TO LOOK AT WHAT'S BEST FOR OUR NON. POPULATION WHAT'S BEST TO DO WITH THESE NURSING HOMES IN THESE OUTBREAKS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH GO THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AN INJURY RAMROD WHAT THEY WANT. AND IT. WITH NO ILL INTENT BULLETS THE PROCESS AND THE PROCESS HERE MATTERS BECAUSE THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE CLEARLY BEING MESSED ON AS STATED WITH YOU KNOW WE ARE 40% OF THE OUTBREAKS HAPPENING ON OUR NURSING HOMES WE GET THEIR STAFF FOR TIER TWO WITH TESTING TO GET A RESULT WE'RE SEEING THESE THINGS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. IN YOU KNOW DIRECTOR WE NEED TO FIX THAT AND THAT FIX IS GOING TO COME FROM YOUR SIDE. AND I WANNA HEAR WHAT YOU INTEND TO DO. BESIDES JUST CONSULT FOR US BECAUSE WHEN YOU SAY CONSULTA SAID. IT MIGHT JUST BE THIS LEGISLATORS OF OPINION BUT IT FEELS LIKE- YOUR YOUR PATENT CHILD ON THE HEAD SAYING IT'S OKAY ALL THAT YOU NOW. BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT WORKS IN YOU KNOW STARTED HAVING THAT CONVERSATION WITH OUR STAFF IT IS HAVING A TRUE POLICY CONVERSATION TO ENSURE. A FULL IN PLACE SO WHAT WHAT IS YOUR PLAN MOVING FORWARD BESIDES JUST THE CONSULTING IN REGARDS TO THIS. WILL SOMEONE AYE I WOULD CONSIDER THAT THE SHARING THAT WE'RE HAVING TODAY IS ALL AN ACT OF LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT ON THE- WAS NOT A REQUEST FOR A SORT OF A DEEP DIVE INTO THE- DETAILS OF A OF A PLAN BENEFIT BUT I'M HAPPY TO COME BACK AT ANY TIME. I'M PERFECTLY BRING ALONG MY MEDICAID. TO DO THE DEEP DIVE WHATEVER WELCOME SO PLEASE DON'T DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE WEEK THAT WE COME HERE RELUCTANTLY ALL NOT AT ALL OF THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP WE WILL. WE WILL IMPROVE WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO BY THE DIALOGUES ALONE BUT IT'S- GOING TO IT ON A- KEEPS MOVING FOR. ON SO LONG AS THE BROUGH OF A DIFFERENT OFFICE WE STILL I MEAN UP. THAT'S QUITE. MALHAM I'M GLAD HEAR THAT AND DO UNDERSTAND THE EX SO. WITH A PANDA. OTHER THAT I HAVE FOR YOU. YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW- FOR THE NEW PROGRAM WE'RE GOING TO DO CONTRACTS WITH PROVIDERS- TO PROVIDE THE IN HOME CARE SERVICE- AS YOU ALL ARE LOOKING AT HOW THOSE CONTRACTS ARE GOING TO BE PUT TOGETHER ARE YOU LOOKING AT LESONS LEARNED- THROUGH OTHER IN HOME CARE. PROVIDERS IN THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN THEIR- LOOKING AT ISSUES WITH THE- HOW THESE CONTRACTS WORK IN THE PAST. WITH OTHER PROVIDER RELATIONSHIPS WE'VE ALWAYS HEARD FROM THE PUBLIC. THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE GREAT PROVIDERS WE HAVE GREAT SERVICES BUT KEEPING. THE STAFF THERE ENSURING THAT THEY'RE PAID WELL ENOUGH TO EVEN BE ABLE TO DO THE COMMUTE- EXPRESSLY IN A REMOTE AREAS- WHAT WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT AS FAR AS LESSONS LEARNED- TO ENSURE THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. ON THAT PATH- THAT THE PROVIDERS AND THE FOLKS THAT WORK FOR THEM. WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE THERE BECAUSE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT- IN HOME CARE WE'RE LOOKING AT FOLKS WITH ALZHEIMER'S REALLY GONNA FOCUS A LOT ON THE DIFFERENT ISSUES. AND AGAIN THOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH THAT PROVIDER ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THIS IS SOMETHING WE LOOK AT A LOT WITH OUR ON. DISABLED COMMUNITY ON A IN ASSURING THEIR ART RELAPSES AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT LOOKING AT AS FAR AS ENSURING THAT AS THEY MOVE FORWARD WITH THOSE CONTRACTS ARE ACTUALLY GONNA HAVE PEOPLE THERE IN THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY GONNA STICK. IN THOSE JOBS AND CAREERS. IT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION. ALL THE ALL AND FOR MOTOR DON'T I'M NOT GOING TO SIT. ACROSS THEIN HOME SERVICES PROGRAM. ISSUES BECAUSE THAT'S AND- MY DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES BUT- AS WE LOOK AT THE SORT OF THE NON FINANCIAL SO PORTION OF THE- LONG TERM CARE TOOL. THE SORTS OF LESSONS I THINK WE WANT TO DRAW. AND REALLY. ON AND LIFT UP. ON THE GREAT EXAMPLE OR THE- WHERE. OR WHO REALLY DON'T. TO IN OF PUTTING TOGETHER THE IN. SO CRY. DISCIPLINARY TEAMS. THAT MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR TO LIVE SAFELY COME. AT HOME FOR YOU KNOW. ALMOST ARE A LOT ALL. THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF ALL AND I THINK WE DEFINITELY WILL TO THE BILL UPON THIS WEEK AS WE- FOR. ALL OUR. IT OUR EXT. IN SORT OF THE ALL RIGHT HER HOME COMMUNITY BASED. OF SUPPORT SYSTEM. A SORT OF A- PER DIEM FEE FOR SERVICE OF PAINT ON THE ABILITY TO REIMBURSE PROVIDERS AT A REASONABLE LEVEL ALL IS BUILT INTO IT ALL AND THE YOU KNOW I THINK IT WILL TAKE AWHILE FOR THE CAPACITY TO TRULY COME UP STATEWIDE. THIS IS NOT GONNA HAPPEN OVERNIGHT OF BIG BANG EVERYWHERE BUT HOME AS THAT CAPACITY IS BUILT OF ICE I THINK IT CAN BE AN ENGINEERING AND STRONG. BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN ALL THE LOCATIONS OF THE COMPARABLE SEARCH PROGRAMS. OKAY AND THEN- ONE LAST QUESTION FOR YOU TALKED ABOUT. SLOTS FOR THE ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER AND HOW THEIR LIMITED- ESPECIALLY IN THE- SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY YOU NOTED FRESNO STOCKTON BAKERSFIELD- MY DISTRICT HAPPENS TO BE KINDA RIGHT RIGHT BETWEEN THE- BAKERSFIELD AND FRESNO AREA GOING ALL THE WAY OUT TO INYO COUNTY- IN EVEN THE PORTIONS THAT I HAVE OF KERN ARE YOU KNOW ONE HOUR AWAY. FROM BAKERSFIELD WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR GETTING SLOTS FOR OUR RURAL AREAS. TO ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW THE THESE ARE POPULATIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE AWAY. ON OFTENTIMES HOURS AWAY FROM LOCAL HOSPITALS. ND YET THE PROBLEMS STILL PERSIST IN AS WE'VE SEEN- COVERED HAS A WAY KIND OF GETTING AROUND EVERYWHERE. SO WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT- FOR ENSURING THAT WE'RE ABLE TO GET TO THOSE AREAS AND NOT LEAVE- A PATCHWORK OF- PLACES ESPECIALLY IN OUR HARD HIT AREAS OF LEFT. OPEN TO KOBE. BECAUSE WHERE WE'RE DOING ALL THESE EFFORTS ARE DOING THESE THINGS BUT- WE STILL HAVE POPULATIONS THAT ARE ARE HOURS AND HOURS AWAY FROM ANA. THESE AREAS THAT ARE GETTING HELP SO ON ON THE NEWS ARE PEOPLE REALLY GREAT YOU KNOW WE'RE READING FIFTY TWO MILLION WERE GETTING STRIKE TEAMS WERE GETTING ALL OF THIS. BOY IN FACT THERE ARE. LARGE SWATHS OF HUGE POPULATION CENTERS- THAT ARE DEEMED RURAL. ALI VICE CELLULAR TULARE- WE HAVE AN OUTBREAK IN THE INDICT NUBA. YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT'S BEING DONE IN THESE AREAS SO THAT WAY THEY'RE NOT GETTING LEFT BEHIND. NO I SO UNFORTUNATE REALITY IS THAT THAT'S WHY WOULD HAVE SORT OF MAKING MY COMMENTS ABOUT THE REQUESTS THERE STILL BEING AVAILABLE CAPACITY BUT IT WOULD REQUIRE A LONG. JUST TO MOVES TO AND ACCEPT SERVICE IN FRESNO BAKERSFIELD ALL SAN JOAQUIN THERE ARE ACTORS THE PROBLEM IS THAT A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE IN THESE RURAL AREAS CAN'T AFFORD TO JUST PICK UP AND MOVE. WANT IN AND HE HAD A PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT. AND I THINK FOR ME. WE FIRST NOTED ISSUES WITHIN OUR NURSING FACILITIES BACK IN MARCH. AND WE ASK FOR STRIKE TEAMS TO COME AND I KNOW I HAVE THOSE PERSONAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENTS WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. ASKING BEGGING FOR STRIKE TEAMS TO COME IN. AND HERE WE ARE MONTHS LATER. AND OKAY STRICTLY IN OLD PEOPLE READ THE NEWS SECTION TO COME THE SILICON VALLEY. BUT DIRECTOR YOU SAID WE NEED TO ASK PEOPLE TO MOVE TO DIFFERENT AREAS THAT'S NOT. EXACTLY I MEAN I'M NOT AGAIN I MEAN. I'M A BROKEN RECORD BUT THAT IS WHY. THE IMPORTANCE OF DOING LONG TERM CARE HOME AS A MEDICAID STATE PLAN BENEFIT MEANS IT'S AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE IT'S NOT HAS. NOT BEEN BUILT ON INDIVIDUAL WAIVER PROGRAMS ONE OF WHICH IS HERE AND THEN ONE OF WHICH IS SIXTY MILES OVER THERE IN THE NEXT ONCE YOU. BACK BEHIND US YOU KNOW IT THERE'S A POINT AT WHICH WHAT WE WHAT WE MUST HAVE IS A STATE WIDE. CAPACITY TO SERVE PEOPLE. AND TOOK. PLACE THEY THE WAIVER. PROGRAMS BECAUSE THOSE ARE HIGHLY SPECIALIZED VERY CAPABLE THEY DO WHAT THEY DO BUT TO. BUILD A SORT OF A DEEPER BENCH BEHIND TOWARD IT AND I AGREE THAT THE THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT PROGRAM. AND WHAT ARE WE DOING RIGHT NOW IN THE IMMEDIATE WHAT ARE WE DOING TO. ENSURE ACCESS TO CARE. SPECIFICALLY FOR MIKE. IN THIS RURAL AREA- WHILE WE WAIT FOR. EVERYTHING ELSE TO GO ALONG. IT PROBABLY AT THIS POINT THE MOST RELIABLE EFFORT WE CAN DO IS THE- INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT BETWEEN THE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THE H. CPA IT'S DBS PROVIDERS WHERE THEY ARE ALL BUT THAT IS LIMITED TO WHERE THEY EXIST AND HAVE CAPACITY THEY'RE NOT GOING TO. SPROUT UP THE NEW ALL IN THE SHORT TERM I MEAN I'M SORRY FOR THAT ANSWER THE TRUTH. WHAT DO YOU SEE IS A WAY TO HELP. EXPEDITE THAT THEY'LL BECAUSE WE KNOW WE CAN'T JUST WAVE A WAND AND HAVE THESE AREAS SPROUT UP BUT WHAT WHAT IS IT THAT THE STATE CAN DO THAT THE DEPARTMENTS CAN DO THAT THE GOVERNOR CAN DO WITH HIS EXECUTIVE POWERS. TO MOVE FORWARD TO GET. IT AND NOT JUST MY HAIR I KNOW DOCTOR WOODS IS. VERY RURAL AND- WE HAVE AREAS HE EVEN IN LA THAT ARE OFTEN FORGOTTEN. SO WHAT IS IT THAT CAN BE DONE ADMINISTRATIVELY. JOINT HELP GAIN ACCESS TO GET MORE SLOTS TO GET THESE FOLKS TAKEN CARE OF. WELL YOU KNOW WHAT I SKIPPED OVER- SHOULDN'T BUT I WAS TRYING TO STAY PRETTY. STARTING THE SPRING OF THE DEPARTED HEALTHCARE SERVICES PRESS YOU. A RAFT OF DISASTER WAIVERS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ALL TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO FLEXIBLY PROVIDE SERVICES ON IN COMMUNITY IN HOMES. AND SO FOR ALL OF THE. WAIT FOR PERSONAL CARE SERVICES WHICH IS SORT OF AN INTENSIVE HOME CARE PROGRAM FOR THE ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER C. BASS FOR MSSP FOR PACE ALL OF THEM RECEIVE WAIVERS STOPS AT RAREST PIECE IN THE PAST FOR EXAMPLE IS PROVIDING SERVICES AND THEN A CENTER AND SO WAS SEABASS NOW IT IS BEING PROVIDED IN HOMES THAT CAN BE EXTENDED. TO TRUE. SORT OF. B. R. THE SORT OF WALLS IF YOU THINK ABOUT OF SYSTEM CAPACITY SO THOSE ARE THE- THINGS WE CAN DO IMMEDIATELY ADDED TO A MEDIA AND- THE PROVIDERS. OF IT'S A QUESTION OF THE REACH REALLY I MEAN I'S BUT- THE ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER IS THE ONE WHICH PARTICULARLY IS. LOCATION BASED ON THE SO THAT ONE. IT IT IT. IT'S A AWFUL THING TO SAY BUT THAT THE SITUATION OF THE PERSON MOVING TO THE PLACE NOT THE THINGS INTO THE FIRST ALL THE REST THOUGH. SORT OF RECEIVE WAIVERS THAT I THINK GIVE THEM OF UNUSUAL DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY NOW THIS IS FLEXIBILITY NOT ONLY. LASTS WHILE THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY CONTINUES UP. AS A FEDERALLY DECLARED A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY ALL. CURRENTLY THAT IS I BELIEVE THROUGH OCTOBER TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN OF ONE US ALL HOPE THAT IT IS TO BE EXTENDED ALL BOOKED.IT THERE THAT'S PROBABLY A VARIETY OF LOCAL. CALCULATIONS WHAT ARE NOT ARMED. THE SO EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE SORT OF TRYING TO LOOK AT WHAT WE PUT IN PLACE GOING FORWARD HAS TO BE THINGS THAT ARE NOT RELYING ON THESE DISASTER WAIVERS BUT RATHER THINGS THAT WE CAN DO THROUGH THE STATE MEDICAID PLAN. BECAUSE WE CONTROL THAT AND WITH CMS APPROVAL OF MODIFICATION ALL THAT'S WE CAN SERVE OUR PUBLIC AS FULLY AS POSSIBLE. OR IN DIRECTOR LASTING ARE YOU DOING COMMUTE. TO THE PUBLIC USE ELIGIBLE- FOR THESE OPTIONS AND WHAT WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT DOING TO LET THEM KNOW THAT HE HERE ARE YOUR OPTIONS. AND I THINK THAT'S- ANOTHER REASON WHY THE PARTNERSHIP WITH YOUR LEGISLATIVE BODY. COMES INTO PLAY TO ELIMINATE ITS HOW THIS MESSAGE GETTING DOWN TO- EVERYBODY BACK HOME BECAUSE- WHEN I GET PHONE CALLS AND- HALF THE PEOPLE I TALK TO HAVEN'T EVEN HEARD OF ANY OF THIS AND WE'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW THE LENGTHY PROCESS OF. YOU KNOW. STATE I HAVE NO PROBLEM HAVING MY STAFF TO USE CONSTITUENT SERVICES WE DO ALL THE TIME BUT IT'S IF THE INFORMATION IS THERE AND IT MAKES MORE SENSE AND IT'S BEING COMMUNICATED. TO FAMILIES. I HELP THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR OPTIONS ARE SO WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT DOING TO GET THAT MESSAGE OUT. THE SHORT TERM IS THE SORT OF. INTENSIFIED CASE MANAGEMENT COORDINATION THERE WE'RE DIRECTING THE MANAGED CARE PLANS TO CONVENE. ON SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE AREA SO THAT THE. MEDICAL PROVIDERS THROUGH THE PLANS AND THE H. C. B. S. PEOPLE ARE CLEARLY TALKING ON SOMETHING WHICH WAS NOT IN YOUR BACKGROUND PACKAGE ALSO SHORT JUST FOR A SECOND BECAUSE IT I THINK IT HELPS EXPLAIN WE DIDN'T CHART PUTS THE CONTINUUM OF ALL OF THE- HE BASED SERVICES. AND IS THIS BILL WILDERNESS SOME BEWILDERING NETWORK THAT PEOPLE READ IT AND SAID WELL YOU KNOW I'M A- FRESHMAN I'M NOT SURE I COULD WORK MY WAY THROUGH THIS. ALL AND THAT IS A PROBLEM AND SO AGAIN. BACK. TO THE ADVANTAGE TO DOING A- MEDICAL PLAN IS THAT IT THEN BECOMES EIGHT WIDELY ACCESSIBLE EASILY AFTER SYSTEM IN WHICH THERE SERVICES ARE. DEVELOPED ON UP ON A PERSON CENTRED BASE. BOTH SOCIAL SERVICES PARENT HEALTH SERVICES THANK IS DIRECTLY LINKED FOR ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS I KNOW ON. AT LEAST IN MY TENURE BEING IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY'S BEEN ASKING FOR A STREAMLINED MAPPING A USED TO GET CRITICISM FOR SAYING WHERE WHERE'S THE APP FOR THAT AND HOW CAN WE HELP PEOPLE GO TO OURAPP AND- GET THINGS DONE AND HAVE A LESS CONFUSING AND NOW WITH ELVIS SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY'S GONE WELL WHERE'S THAT HAPPEN. WE ASK FOR IT YEARS AGO SO LET'S SEE WHERE WE GO NOW. THANK YOU. CORRECT. THANK YOU DIRECTOR LIFE FORM. FIRST THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF KEEPING PEOPLE AT HOME KEEPING THEM IN THEIR COMMUNITY YOU'RE GOING TO GET SUPPORT FROM ALL OF US ON THAT OUR LONG TERM CARE AT HOME IT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA I REMEMBER WITH OUR AGING A LONG TERM CARE COMMITTEE. CHAIR NAZARIAN HAD A HEARING SPECIFICALLY ON THE ISSUE. SO THE CONCEPT. IS A GREAT CONCEPT. AND JUSTICE CHAIR. OURHEALTH CHAIR HAD MENTIONED IT'S THE PROCESS. WE DO EED TO BE THAT NOT JUST CONSULTED PARTNERS IN THIS WHOLE PROCESS WE DO HAVE A VOICE AND WE REPRESENT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO LOOK TO US AND EXPECT US TO TELL THEM WHAT IS HAPPENING I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME CON. PART OF WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IS THAT IN CONSULTATION WITH BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS HAS NOT BEEN DONE IN CONSULTATION WITH. THE LEGISLATURE I DO WANT TO ALSO SAY THAT IN THE DOCUMENT THAT WE RECEIVED. IT IS NOT JUST A CENTRAL VALLEY THAT HAS THE HOT SPOTS BUT THE INLAND EMPIRE THAT I REPRESENT. AND I WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE DON'T FORGET THE INLAND EMPIRE THAT IS SUFFER TREMENDOUSLY- I ON A PERSONAL NOTE I LOST MY UNCLE. HE'S ONE OF THOSE STATISTICS. AND FOR MY UNCLE HE IT BECOMES A STATISTIC BUT IT'S VERY PERSONAL FOR MYSELF AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. IT'S PERSONAL FOR THEM THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR LOVED ONES. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK HAS BEEN MISSING AND I KNOW THAT WILL HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE OTHER PANELS IS THE PEOPLE THAT WILL BE WORKING AND- MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS. WE KNOW THERE'S BEEN THERE'S BEEN A SHORTAGE IN SOME OF THE HEARINGS WE'VE HEARD FROM S. YEAH YOU YOU D. W. THEY'RE THE ONES PROVIDING SO MUCH OF THE- IN HOME. SUPPORT SERVICES. THEY'RE THE ONES HELPING KEEPING HELPING TO KEEP PEOPLE AT HOME. YET THEY'VE BEEN STRUGGLING TO GET BENEFITS AT A PROPER RATE. PROPER BENEFITS BENEFITS FOR THEMSELVES. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CLEARLY NEED TO ADDRESS IN ALL OF THIS AND I'M NOT SURE. FROM WHAT I HAVE READ. THAT THAT HAS BEEN ADDRESSED. SO I WANT TO BEGIN WITH THAT IS. THOSE WHO ARE EXPECTED. TO HELP PEOPLE STAY AT HOME AND IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WHAT SPECIFICALLY IS BEING DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS. WITH RESPECT CHAU REYES ALL THE RIGHT TO SUCH PROGRAMS YOU KNOW IS PART OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES NOT PART OF THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES ON HOWEVER I'M OBVIOUSLY VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROGRAM SERVED OVER THERE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS ALL. THE I THINK OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE SEEN A STRENGTHENING OF. IN MANY RESPECTS THE WAY OF RIGHTEOUSNESS PROGRAM OF EXTENDED STANDARDS CARE GIVING. WORKFORCE ALL HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED ALL. COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS PUBLIC AUTHORITY STRUCTURE SYSTEMS ALL THE YOU KNOW. WHETHER INADEQUATE WAGE INCREASES THE ALL RIGHT AHEAD OF MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES SO THE- ALL OF THAT ONE HOPES CONTINUES GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR JOB THAT'S NOT ONE THAT I'M SORT OF ON THE THAT I HAVE THE I HAVE THE DIAL. ON WHAT RAISING IT I THINK POINTS TO. ONE OF MY BIG CONCERNS AS WE MOVE FORWARD IF THE LONG TERM CARE HOME BENEFIT GETS LINKED. CONCEPTUAL TO RESOLVING EVERY OTHER OUTSTANDING ISSUES. THAT CAN BE RAISED MANY OF STATUS IS THE CAMPAIGN RAISED THEM WE SHOULD ABANDON IT NOW BECAUSE WE CAN'T POSSIBLY. RECONCILE WITH WE CAN'T CARRY ALL ON THIS. ON THE STREETS OF THE THERE ARE MANY OTHER SETTINGS WHERE ALL THE BARGAINING RIGHTS OF I'VE JUST SUCH WORKERS. WILL BE. CONSIDERED DEBATED IN BUDGET SETTINGS THAT ARE NOT IN MY DEPARTMENT- BUT I HAVE TO BE POINTED. EVEN A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE IN DE LINKING ISSUES THAT IF LINK. SENSUALLY TAKE A LONG TERM CARE HOME PROPOSAL AND TAKEN HOSTAGE TO OTHER SHIPS DIRECTOR IF I MADE THEM WHO ARE THE WORKERS THAT ARE GOING TO HELP KEEP OUR PEOPLE AT HOME AND IN THEIR COMMUNITY. IN THE IN A LARGE PART OF THE PROGRAM THAT WILL SERVE THE SYSTEM DATE. ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING ALL WILL BE THE IHS US WORKS AND I HOPE AND THEY WILL COLLECTIVELY BARGAIN AND GET ALL MY HOPE GOOD WAGES AND HEALTH BENEFITS NOW IT IS YOU KNOW THOSE VERY FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY. THERE ARE MADE COUNTY THAT I LOST SERVED AT SANTA CLARA COUNTY WE PROVIDED FULL HEALTH COVERAGE FULL DENTAL COVERAGE ANY COUNTY CAN DO. THAT PLEASE TALK TO THE ACCOUNTING. I RECOGNIZE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE VERY PEOPLE WERE GOING TO DEPEND ON WE DO HAVE WE CANNOT D. LINK THEM I DON'T SEE HOW WE COULD POSSIBLY DO LINK THEM THEY HAVE TO BE PART OF THIS ENTIRE CONVERSATION BUT I JUST I WANT TO IT I KNOW YOU SAID YOU KNOW THIS BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE THIS ON THE SCREEN. BUT THIS IS WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT WE'RE SO GLAD THAT CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA CALLED THIS SPECIFIC HEARING YEAH THE PAST CHAIR OF HUMAN SERVICES YOU OF THE PRESENT CHAIR OF HUMAN SERVICES YOU HAVE THE CHAIR OF OUR HEALTH YOU THE CHERUBAGING LONG TERM CARE THE CHAIR BUDGET YOU HAVEN'T WON THE SERIES ADVOCATES OF DISABILITIES AND OF COURSE TO THE SHARE OF SUB ONE. THIS IS HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS THAT A SONOS CHEER ARAMBULA TOLD US HE WAS CONVENING THIS HEARING WE ALL WANTED TO BE HERE WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING SO THAT WE CAN THEN PROVIDE INPUT AND BE INVOLVED. IN THIS AND BE MORE THAN JUST. CONSULTED AT WITH ANOTHER QUESTION IF I MAY. IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE WOULD WITNESS DURING THE PANDEMIC IS THE CEAR INTERSECTION BETWEEN% OUR STATE SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS AND NURSING FACILITIES. HOW DO YOU SEE THIS BENEFIT IMPACTING THOSE PROGRAMS SUCH AS MS US P. C. BELLS I HSS AND IN THE FUTURE. WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF THE RECESSION IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. RIGHT NOT TO PREDICT WHAT I CAN'T CONTROL ALL OF THE- LET ME REITERATE WHAT I WAS SAYING EARLIER IN THE PRESENTATION OF. THE LONG TERM CARE HOME. BENEFIT WOULD NOT AFFECT MSSP SEA. HYDROCEPHALUS. WELL DONE RECIPROCAL ST BECAUSE I JUST S. IS A BIT DIFFERENT ARTISTS AS BENEFIT CAN BE PART OF LONG TERM CARE TO HELP PEOPLE D. CLIENTS WHO SOMEONE CHOOSES LONGER GERITOL IT'S A CHOICE. COULDN'T CAN ALSO WILL. PROBABLY ALSO HAVE OUR JUSTICE BENEFITS IN ORDER AND SERVICES PROVIDE. WITH C. BOSTON MSSP DOC BECOMES BECAUSE THERE. RELATED PROGRAM BECAUSE THEY'RE WITHIN THE SAME FUNDING STREAM. PEOPLE COPYING BOOKS SO- BENEFICIARY WOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE WHAT THEY- WANT TO BE IN A SPEECH OR TO THE ONE FIFTY BASS OR DO THEY WANT TO BE A LONG TERM CARE TAL. NOPE AS FAR AS IT THE IMPACT ON THE EXISTING SEA BASS AND ALSO SPEAK PROGRAMS. I DON'T SEE AN IMPACT OLDER THEN ALL STEP. DAUGHTER FOR SOME REASON THE SOME CONSUMER CHOOSE NOT TO USE THEM ALL. VERSUS LONG TERM CARE TALK THAT MARCH QUESTION I DON'T KNOW WE CAN GET INTO WELL CERTAINLY FOR. THOSE PROGRAMS AND PACE WHAT SORT OF THE BEGINNING I OULD BE SHOCKED IF WE DIDN'T SEE THOSE PROVIDERS STARTING TO SORT OF SPECIALIZED A- NEW BRANCH OF THEIR SERVICES BECAUSE THEY'RE GOOD IT SHOULD ACTUALLY BE PART OF THE CONTRACTORS FOR THE LONG TERM CARE HOME SO IN FACT ASSIST I. SEE THAT IT'S LIKELY TO BE AN EXPANSION OF THEIR- THERE MODEL HOME BUT IT WOULD BE AGAINST THEIR TRUCKS I MEAN WE'RE NOT. MAKING IT BUT IT IS NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE THEM IN ANY FASHION. THE IF I COULD JUST I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAIDWHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE COMMITMENT ALL THE PEOPLE ON THE- LEGISLATIVE DíAS TODAY ON THE COMMITTEE SAID ONE LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY- DISTRICT WHEN I STARTED OUT IN THE FIELD IT WAS A LONG LONG TIME AGO IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES. IN SAN FRANCISCO WHEN I WORKED FOR CATHOLIC CHARITIES AND I WORKED IN IN THE AGING SIDE OF THE FIELD AND WE DID HOUSING FOR THE ELDERLY YOU HAVE YOUR OTHER CATHOLIC NURSING HOMES FOR THE ELDERLY SYSTEMS OUT WHAT THERE NEVER WAS THAT WE HAD WE NEVER SUCCEEDED. IN FINDING OUT HOW TO HOLD PROGRAM THAT COULD REALLY KEEP PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN MEDICALLY SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL. IN THEIR HOMES AND THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED UNTIL I SAW. IN CHINATOWN OF DOCTOR G. O. CREATE. WHAT WAS THAT IT WAS STILL CALL UNLOCK WHICH REALLY WHAT'S THE FIRST OF THE PACE PROGRAMS AND IT WORKED. IT WAS AN ENORMOUS SUCCESS. AND SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS IS FULFILLING GOSH WHAT A SIGNAL MOST FORTY FIVE PLUS YEARS OF WHAT I. WANTED TO SEE HAPPEN ALL. BUT AVAILABLE. IN THE MEDICAID PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE YOU KNOW DEDICATED MEDICAL MEDICAID MEDICARE WORKS AS WELL ALL. THE WHOLE BENEFIT SO THE BLOCKS. IF I SEEM A LITTLE IMPASSIONED AND NOT WILLING TO STOP A SLOWDOWN. THERE'S A BOAT SO LET ME LET ME EXPRESS MY PASSION IN THIS ALSO. THE REASON THAT I ASK THAT IS THAT THERE WAS A PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY TO ELIMINATE SEA BASS AND MSSP WITH A NO BRIDGE. YOU'RE SAYING THIS PROGRAM IS NOT. INTENDED TO ELIMINATE THEM SO IMAGINE OUR CONCERN WITH THIS AND THE FACT THAT WE AREN'T INCLUDED IN THIS PROCESS- AND ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE ARE. BEING PROPOSED. AND THEY HAVE GREAT IMPACT ON THE VERY PEOPLE WE REPRESENT YEAH WE DON'T GET TO% GIVE OUR INPUT WE WOULD WE AREN'T CONSULTED WE AREN'T PARTNERED WITH- THIS IS A REALLY BIG DEAL. AND I RETURN TO WHAT I SAID I'VE IDENTIFIED THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE WHO ARE ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT THIS IS THE BEST PROGRAM POSSIBLE. NOTE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME. SOME SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOUSE DIVIDING IT INTO DOING THE URGENCY- ISSUES NOW RELATED TO COVE IT AND THEN HAVING THE STAKEHOLDER- MEETINGS AND THE LEGISLATORS MEETINGS AND CONSULTATIONS TRUE CONSULTATIONS ARE PROVIDING FOR TRUE TRANSPARENCY SO THAT IN TWENTY IT NEXT YEAR WE THEN PUT TOGETHER THE BEST PROGRAM POSSIBLE WITH TRUE INPUT IS THAT STILL A POSSIBILITY. SEE IT IT'S NOT A BINARY CHOICE IT'S NOT ANY THE ROLE I MEAN WE'RE GOING TO PURSUE THOSE SHORT TERM OF ITEMS THAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER. HOPEFULLY WITH SOME PEOPLE FIND THE DOCUMENTS WERE SENT OVER ON THE DESCRIBES THEM ALL THAT JUST HAPPENED SPENT AND TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE INLAND EMPIRE OUR INTENTION IS TO SORT OF. USE IT AS A TEMPLATE AND THEN. SUMIT WE SEE SOME SUCCESS FROM IT MOVE INTO OTHER AREAS. OF IN YOUR HIGH IMPACT ON. AT THE SAME TIME PARALLEL TRACK IS. THIS PROCESS WITH LONG TERM CARE HOME WHICH AS I SAID I'M HAPPY TO COME BACK HERE. EVERY MONDAY- BUT I'LL BRING THE TECHNICAL STUFF NEXT ON AND- CLICK THROUGH THE DETAILS WITH INTERESTED LEGISLATORS ON CHILL EVERY TIRE HAS BEEN KICKED. ALL WHAT A CHARACTER. IS AMID ALL OF THAT WORK ALL OF THAT STAKEHOLDERS STILL ALL THAT SYSTEM DESIGNED TO BAN. HOWEVER WELL MAYBE YES MAYBE NO DECISION. AFTER THE AFTER JANUARY ALL WHICH AS WE JUST FOUND OURSELVES TALKING ABOUT A FEW MOMENTS AGO CAN SO EASILY GET LINKED TO OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE. NOT INHERENTLY CENTRAL TO IT SO. I HOPE I'M BEING HONEST AND CLEAR ABOUT THIS OF. I'D LIKE I MEAN IT WHEN I SAY IT WILL COME BACK EVERY MONDAY. I DON'T. I DON'T QUESTION YOUR YOUR YOUR HONESTY YOUR RECIPE I DON'T QUESTION THAT ONE BIT. I THINK THOUGH THAT- JUST AS YOU'RE NEW TO THAT POSITION. THERE MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE IS NEW TO THE POSITION WILL FORGET WHAT IT IS YOU TOLD US YOU WOULD YOU'D BE DOING EVERY MONDAY. SO WHAT CAN BE PUT INTO THE PROPOSAL TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS SPECIFIC OVERSIGHT FROM THE LEGISLATURE. L. AS THE PROCESS GOES FORWARD AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DETAILS. OF THE BENEFIT TO CONTINUE- I THINK THAT THE TIMELINE FOR THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN SO RAPID. THAT THE CHANNELS OF COMMUNICATION THE CHANNELS OF FEEDBACK THIS CHANNELS OF A CONSULTATION- HAVE BEEN- THAT HAVE NOT BEEN THE- HAVE NOT BEEN UTILIZED COMPLETELY OR PROPERLY. SO WHAT IS IT THAT YOU CAN PROPOSE SHOULD THIS MOVE FORWARD. WHAT IS IT YOU CAN PROPOSED TO ENSURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE OVERSIGHT IS PART OF THE PROCESS. IN WRITING. I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THE. WILL YOU WILL YOU GIVE SOME THOUGHT TO THAT- AND IN YOUR DISCUSSION AS PART. I PROJECT BORDERS AS I DON'T THINK THERE IS AN ANSWER TO THE OUT OF HOME. IT'S I JUST COMMITTED TO. CONSTANT CONVERSATION ABOUT SELECT IS NEEDED. OKAY SO BESIDES CONVERSATION AND THAT THAT I JUST IF I MAY UM NOT TO BELABOR THE ISSUE BUT- THIS. CONVERSATION THIS CONSULTATION ONLY HAPPENED BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH CHAIR ARAMBULA REQUESTED IT AND THIS ISN'T THE WAY IT SHOULD BE DONE THANK YOU MISTER DIRECTOR THANK YOU RICHARD. THANK YOU AND- SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS I FIRST JUST WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS FOR THEIR THOROUGH QUESTIONS AND AMOUNT OF DETAIL THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO FLUSH OUT. AS DIRECTOR LIGHT BORN TALKED ABOUT HIS HISTORY I FIRST ONE ACTUALLY THANK HIM THIS IS THE FIRST MEETING THAT- I HAVE SEEN YOU PRESENT THAT AS- YOU IN YOUR CURRENT POSITION AND I COULDN'T THINK OF A BETTER PERSON TO SIT IN THAT SEAT NOW I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO COMBINE SOCIAL SERVICES AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAST EIGHT YEARS AS DIRECTOR. YOUR DIPLOMACY AND YOUR COMMITMENTS TO PROCESS WILL BE NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THE APPROPRIATE POLICIES ARE BEING PUT FORWARD FOR US AS A STATE. I DO WANT TO BRING MY EXPERIENCE IF I CAN TO THE TABLE AS WELL. BECAUSE I BELIEVE AS A DOCTOR IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM DOCTOR ONE OF THE SKILLS I HAD TO LEARN. QUICKLY WAS TO TRIAGE. AND IT APPEARS THAT WHAT I'M SEEING FROM YOU IS. PUTTING A NEW OPTION ON THE TABLE. AND I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE IS THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH THE CRISIS THAT WE HAVE AT HAND WHICH IS COVERED NINETY. AND THE ORIGINAL PRESENTATION OF THIS PROPOSAL SEEMED TO LINK THIS BENEFIT WITH COVERT NINETEEN. AND I'M NOT. SURE I CAN GO THERE BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT. THIS POLICY NEEDS TO SLOW DOWN AND IS BEING RUSHED AND SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO DIRECTLY TO COVERT NINETEEN. AND BECAUSE OF THAT I HAVE A I STRUGGLE A LITTLE BIT WITH WANTING TO PROVIDE THE URGENCY THIS YEAR AT ALL. I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED THE PUBLIC PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE WE ARE ANSWERING ALL THE APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS. NOW WHAT I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IS YOUR ASSESSMENT DIRECTOR WHICH IS THAT WE DO HAVE A PATCHWORK OF AGING SERVICES THAT WE DO NOT HAVE A COORDINATED INTEGRATED SERVICE THAT THERE'S A NEED FOR US TO TALK ABOUT ET AND HOSPITAL DISCHARGES AND WHERE PEOPLE GO AND WHAT TRANSITION LOOKS LIKE AND THAT WE NEED TO WORK TOWARDS A STATE WIDE CAPACITY. I SEE WHERE IT IS THAT YOU'RE DRIVING TOWARDS WITH THE NINETEEN FIFTEEN HI WAIVER LOOKING TO CREATE AN UNCAPPED BENEFIT BUT I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE DO IS IN MEDICINE WE ALWAYS SAID YOU MEASURE TWICE AND CUT ONCE. AND SO I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE- ARE DOING OUR DUE DILIGENCE AND- IF I CAN. I THINK WHAT CHAIR RAILS WAS TRYING TO GET TO AND IF I CAN JUST ASK A DIRECT QUESTION. GIVEN HOW MUCH THE PROPOSAL IS CHANGING. CAN THE ADMINISTRATION COMMITS TO BRINGING US A STABLE PROPOSAL FOR CONSIDERATION IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND ALLOWING FOR A PUBLIC DELIBERATIVE PROCESS. IF IN BRINGING A STABLE OUR FIRST IF IT ISN'T A STABLE PROPOSAL BY THEN IT WILL BE BECAUSE FRANKLY. CONCLUDED THAT IT'S NOT FEASIBLE ALL. THEREFORE I HAD WHAT I ANTICIPATE IS THAT BY THE TIME WE ARE IN JANUARY BUDGET HEARINGS WILL BE ABLE TO REPORT OUT EITHER THAT. YES THIS WE HAVE A STATE PLAN BENEFITS THAT CAN BE. MADE AS A AS A NINETEEN FIFTEEN I AM AMENDMENT AWAY FOR MANY TO THE STATE. ALL OR OR WE DON'T- THAT IS THE COMMITMENT ALLIF. PRECISE BECAUSE- HONESTLY BETWEEN ALWAYS BEEN IMPORTANT ALL IF THE QUESTION IS WILL BE WELL I MIGHT BE SAYING WE WILL BRING UP FOR A VOTE OF SOME SORT DOWNTURN. NOW WHEN I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT THE PROPOSAL THAT'S PUT BEFORE US IS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CONSULT AND CONTINUE TO WASSAN AND DELIBERATE ON THROUGH THE NEXT YEAR I JUST AM TRYING TO ROAD MAP OUT A LITTLE BIT WHAT SOME OF THOSE NEXT STEPS ARE AND THEN THAT TEAM I HAVE THREE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS AND THEN I MAY MOVE US FROM THE PAST. AND APPRECIATE THE STAMINA AND WHICH YOU HAVE GIVEN US BUT IT BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT A SOCIAL SERVICES LANDS WHAT PERSON CENTRED ACCOUNTABILITY AND OUTCOME MEASURES WILL BE USED TO SHOW THAT THIS BENEFIT IS HELPING AND NOT HURTING AFFECTED MEDICARE RECIPIENTS. THE EVALUATION IS GOING TO OCCUR IN AT LEAST TWO OF THE- ON THAT FIRST IS ON. HEALTH ACUITY MEASUREMENTS ARE UP OR PEOPLE STAINED. WELL ARE BECAUSE THEY'RE HEALTH STABILIZED ARE THEY- NOT HAVING TO GO REPEATEDLY TO EMERGENCY CARE FROM HOME I MEAN WHAT THE GOAL IS TO HAVE STABLE HEALTHCARE THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS SAYING TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE IF SOMEBODY NEEDS TWENTY FOUR HOUR MEDICAL CARE THAT. THIS PROGRAM WILL WORK FOR THEM THAT NEED TO BE IN AN INSTITUTIONAL SETTING BUT ASSUMING THAT THEY CAN BE MAINTAINED WITH LOOK LET'S YOU KNOW SORT OF A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF HOURLY CARE. ALL OF THAT WILL BE A LOT OF DAILY HERE ALL THAT THEN WILL. BE ONE SECOND MEASURES ALL ARE THE HAPPY. WITH SOME UP WITH THAT QUESTION WE PEOPLE ON IF THEY- CAME FROM THE NURSING. TOOK THE LONG TERM CARE. ARE THEY MORE SERVICE ARE LESS WITH THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THEIR DAVID. ON IF THEY CHECK IF THEY MOVED FROM ALL POSSIBLE DISCHARGE. TO OUR TOTAL IN THEIR HOMES OR THEY SATISFIED WITH ARTICULATE CONFIDENT THAT THEY ARE GETTING AND WILL GET THE CARE THEY NEED- DOT SO THAT IT'S GOING TO BE A CRITICAL PIECE TO IT AND FINE TUNE WITHIN THOSE TWO ON THE I REALLY LOOK TO THE YOU KNOW THE- HAPPINESS PART OF IT HOUSE TOOK OUR THAT'S WHERE THEIR SOCIAL CARE IS GOING TO COME INTO- ARE THEY FEELING THAT. THEY WERE IN CONTROL OF THEIR ENVIRONMENT. THEY'RE ALL. OKAY DAY LIVING IN. SO ABOUT THOSE LAWS OF THE PORT THOUGHT WERE I THINK WE- SOCIAL. AND MEDICAL CARE TO ONE PACKAGE. YOU KNOW I'M I'M REALLY INTERESTED BY ONE OF THE COMMENTS YOU HAD WHICH IS. IF YOU NEED US TO FOCUS ON THIS NEW OPTION AND NOT TO FIX ALL THE OTHER ISSUES WITHIN THE PROGRAMS. AND I BELIEVE WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT FIX FOR ME IS TO ACTUALLY SAY THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM ISN'T WORKING FOR ALL PEOPLE. AND WHERE I GO IS TO THINK BACK TO MY DAYS ON THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WHERE IF YOU WERE JUST CHARGING SOMEONE YOU DON'T ALWAYS HAVE A STABLE. LACED TO GO WITH SYSTEM THAT WORKED WITHIN NOT ONLY JUST YOUR COUNTY BUT ACROSS COUNTY LINES WHICH IS. WHY I SEE THE LOGIC FOR BUILDING THE STATE WIDE CAPACITY. BUT I WANTED IF YOU COULD TO HAVE YOU EXPLAIN HOW THIS BENEFIT THE SHARES A PROPER AND COORDINATED. HOSPITAL DISCHARGE AND CASE IT'S INHERENT TO TOOK THE DESIGN OF IT I MEAN IF IT'S IF IT'S THE- INDIVIDUAL. PERSON THE PERSON WAS THE CENTER OF ALL THIS IF IT'S YOU KNOW THEIR DOCTOR IS CONCLUDING THAT EITHER THEY NEED TO GO TO SKILLED CARE OR ALTERNATIVELY HAVE LONG TERM CARE TOLD. AND THEN. IS MAKING THAT REFERRAL INTO. WHOEVER IS DOT LOCAL CONTRACTOR FOR THE LONG TERM CARE TO PROGRAM ALL WAS THEM DOING THE INDIVIDUAL WORKING WITH THE DOCTOR THE PHYSICIAN DURING THE INDIVIDUALIZED PERSON CENTERED CASE PLAN ALL AND THEN SORT OF SAYING WHAT ARE THESE RANGE OF NEEDS I'M IS THERE THE NEED FOR WOUND CARE IS THERE THE NEED FOR GI TO HAVE MAINTENANCE IS THERE THE NEED TO. GO DOWN THE LIST AND THEN COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF IT THE SOCIAL COMES ON TO SAY AND FOR THE PERSON DOES OR DOESN'T HAVE EIGHT AVAILABLE CARE GIVER IN THE WHOLE OF THEIR THAT CARE GIVERS CAPACITY IS WALKED OFF IF THEY ARE WORKING ON. SCHOOL DAY SHIFTS AND ARE NOT HOME DURING THE DAY. THAT IS THERE A DEVELOPER OF ALL OF THREE CARE GIVER. PRESENCE THE WHOLE AND THEN WHAT IS REALLY THE- OF THE HOME CARE GIVERS AND THEY HAVE TO BE BROUGHT INTO THE CONVERSATION TO THIS IS WHERE THE CARE GIVER RESOURCE ALL NETWORKS COME INTO PLAY ON. IT TOP CONVERSATION BUT PEOPLE MAY NOT BE TOTALLY UP FRONT ABOUT WHAT THE TENANT CARE ACT ASSIST ALL AND THAT HAS TO BE FACTORED INTO A CARE PLAN AND IF THEY CARED IF THERE IF WE CAN'T COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE CARE GIVER PLAN THEN IT DOESN'T PROBABLY WORK FOR THE CLIENT BUT IF WE CAN EITHER THROUGH THE CARE GIVER WAS AT HOME WITH SUPPORT OR ALTERNATIVE CARE GIVER UP THAT MAYBE IT IS WORKING AND THEN. THE CCT PROGRAM THEY NEED TO COME IN TO DO QUALIFICATIONS TO MAKE MAKE THE PACKAGE WORK THAT'S THE WAY IN WHICH I THINK THE WHOLE COMES TOGETHER- BUT IT'S BECAUSE- ALL THOSE PIECES. KERN OPERATE. IN AN INTEGRATED FASHION AS OPPOSED TO THE PATCHWORK WHERE IF SOMEBODY LINKS UP WITH ONE PROGRAM VERSUS ANOTHER PROGRAM TO LOOK AT SOME OF THAT NEED MET BUT MAYBE NOT ALL. I'M AND I WILL COMMAND THE DEPARTMENT FOR LOOKING FOR FLEXIBILITY SPECIFICALLY THE ONE REGARDING GREATER THAN SIXTY DAYS STAYS WITHIN US WAS AN EASY ONE. FOR US TO HIGHLIGHT BUT I DO BELIEVE THERE WERE MULTIPLE THAT YOU WORKED IN JUST ONE ARE COMMENDED FOR THAT. NOW I WILL AND THANK THIS PANEL BUT I DO WANT TO STATE I'VE- MADE IN MY LIFE MISSION TO WORK TOWARD HEALTH EQUITY. AND SO I DO WANT TO HAVE A LANDS OF AN EQUITY LINE IS TO ASK THE DEPARTMENT IF. FOR WHAT POPULATIONS IN PARTICULAR WOULD THIS AFFECT AND WITH THIS MAGNIFY RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES THAT ARE ALREADY WIDE EVEN FURTHER. WELL WE SHARE THE I ALREADY RUN HEALTH EQUITY ALL THAT IS SORT OF MY MANTRA ONE AND EVERYTHING IN THE PREPARATORY WORK ON RIGHT. OKAY AND THE DESIGN THAT WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS HAS TO ADDRESS THAT ALONG THERE G. E. O. BEST PART ON AGING LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS HOUSE OF EQUITY SO GROUP THAT WE'RE IN DIALOGUE WITH THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP WE'VE- BROADENED IT TO INCLUDE VOICES. WHO CAN ALL SHORTLY POINT US TO PLACES WHERE IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE THE PIECES WHERE I THAT I KNOW HAS WEEKS OF GONE BACK TO LOOK AFTER. ALL ARE THESE ARE GETTING THE RIGHT NOTES ON A LIST OF AT ONE POINT THERE WAS ALL SORT OF A- AN ASSUMPTION THAT OF LONG TERM CARE AT HOME COULD NOT BE PROVIDED IN OF ASSISTED LIVING SIDE. I THINK THAT IS NO SORT OF. BEING REQUESTED PRECISELY BECAUSE DEPENDING ON- PEOPLE'S INCOME LEVELS. RESOURCES OUTSIDE. THE INSTITUTIONAL SETTING ALL. WE NEED TO BE SENSITIVE TO WHAT IS A REALISTIC FOR PEOPLE AND I WAS A LOOK AT THAT I KEEP PUTTING IT ON THE ICE OFF ARE THERE. SITUATIONS THAT ARE. THAT PEOPLE OF COLOR. LOWEST INCOME RECIPIENTS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCESS SO WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT WE CAN ACCESS. ALL THAT'S OF. ALL OF THE GATE WHAT HAPPENED. WITH THAT I WANTED TO THANK THIS FIRST PANEL AND WE WILL MOVE ON. TO STAKEHOLDER REACTION PANEL WE WILL FIRST HEAR FROM PATTY BERG THE FORMER STATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FORMER CHAIR OF ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE NUMBER ONE AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON AGING AND LONG TERM CARE. WE ALSO HAVE CARING KIESLER THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES FOR IHS US AND TIFFANY WHITTON LONG TERM CARE DIRECTOR S. CI YOU CALIFORNIA. MODERATOR IF YOU COULD CONNECT OUR FIRST PANELIST. PINE IS OPEN. BURGER BELIEVE YOU THE FIRST PANELIST YOUR LINE IS OPEN IN THE SPEECH. ALL CAN YOU HEAR ME TOO YES YES WE CAN GO AHEAD ALL GREAT I'M SO SORRY OKAY GOOD MORNING THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TUESDAY AND SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S LONG TERM CARE AT HOME PROPOSAL WELL I HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS I DO FEEL THAT THE PROGRAM STATED GOAL TO PROVIDE A MORE COORDINATED SET OF MEDICAL AND HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES IT'S A LOT OF ONE. WE ALL KNOW THAT OUR LONG TERM CARE SYSTEM IS BROKEN CALIFORNIA'S OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES STRUGGLE TO ACCESS STREAMLINED COORDINATED CARE AND BUSINESS DUE TO MANY ISSUES INCLUDING LACK OF CAPACITY WORKFORCE CHALLENGES AN UNDERFUNDED SYSTEM AND FRAGMENTATION ACROSS SILOS OF CARE I HAVE WRITTEN AND BEEN INVOLVED WITH THREE MASTER PLANS ON AGING FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND MOST RECENTLY AS A MEMBER OF THE LTSS SUBCOMMITTEE. THE ISSUE ADDRESSED IN THIS PROPOSAL NAMELY THE TRANSITION CARE BETWEEN HOSPITAL TO HOME A NURSING HOME TO HOME IT'S NOT A NEW ONE IN OTH THE TWENTY FIFTEEN MASTER PLAN AND THE TWENTY TWENTY LTSS REPORT THE ISSUE OF CARE TRANSITION TO WHAT THE DRAFT WITH CONCRETE RECOMMENDATIONS I HAVE IDENTIFIED CONCERNS RELATED TO THIS PROPOSAL MY FIRST CONCERN RELATES TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THE TARGET POPULATION PARTICULARLY MEDICARE RECIPIENTS WHO NEED LONG TERM CARE SERVICES. THIS DATA INDICATES THAT QUOTE NOT ALL MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WHO REQUIRE LONG TERM CARE SERVICES WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS BENEFIT UNQUOTE WHY IS THE PROGRAM CALLED LONG TERM CARE AT HOME IF PEOPLE NEEDING LONG TERM. CARE MIGHT NOT BE INCLUDED. FURTHER IT UP IN. THAT QUOTE MANY OF THE LONG TERM CARE. FOR UNDER THE BENEFIT. MAY BE AVAILABLE OTHER AVENUES AND OUR PROGRAMS AND WELL. THIS SEEMS TO BE CONFUSING AND APPEARS TO ADD ON TO THE SIDE OF THE FRAGMENTATION OF THE CURRENT SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. WHEN I LOOK AT THE EXAMPLES LISTED ON PAGE THREE AND FOUR OF THE REPORT APPROVAL WOULD BE SERVED UNDER THIS PROGRAM I HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT WORKFORCE SERVICE DELIVERY AND COST NEEDED TO CARE FOR THAT POPULATION IN A HOME SETTING. THIS RELATES TO MY SECOND CONCERN REGARDING INFRASTRUCTURE AND ENSURING WE HAVE THE SERVICE SOMEPLACE BEFORE TRANSITIONING INDIVIDUALS HOME. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LACKS A STATEWIDE INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING WORKFORCE CAPACITY TO ACHIEVE THE VISION OF THIS PROPOSAL MULTISPECIALTY IN RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE LIKE WHERE I LIVE OUT OF. MY THIRD CONCERN FOCUSES ON WORKFORCE CAPACITY AND THE AVAILABILITY OF BOTH PAID CARE GIVERS AND UNPAID FAMILY CAREGIVERS WHO WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM. THE PROPOSAL WITH THREE PRIMARY CATEGORIES HAVE SKILLED NURSING CARE THAT MAY BE PROVIDED IN THE HOME ALL OF THOSE IDENTIFIED IN THESE CATEGORIES WILL INITIALLY NEED TWENTY FOUR SEVEN DAYS A WEEK SHARE BINDING BEST CARE ESPECIALLY NOW IN THE PANDEMIC ENVIRONMENT. IS PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING AND IT'S ALSO VERY COSTLY. ADDITIONALLY UNPAID FAMILY OR FRIEND CARE GIVERS OFTEN FACE SITUATION WHERE THEY ARE CHALLENGED TO PERFORM HEALTH MAINTENANCE STAFF FOR LOVED ONES IN THE HOME. INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO TUBE FEEDINGS VENTILATOR CARE OSTOMY CARE AND OTHER. IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER FAMILY CARE GIVERS WILL BE ASKED TO PERFORM THESE TASKS OR WHETHER NURSES OR LPNS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BARRIERS TO OBTAINING THE SERVICES INCLUDING WORKFORCE SHORTAGES. AND COST OF CARE. I FOURTH CAN CENTER ON BY UP AND EXTRA HOUSING FOR THE WHO HAVE NO HOME RETURN TO. THE CURRENT PROPOSAL LACKS A CLEAR STRATEGY TO ENSURE THE HOUSING STOCK WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR POPULATIONS NEED. BIKE PATH CONCERN CENTERS ON THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE IN DEVELOPING A FRAMEWORK THAT THIS PROPOSAL AND THEN OVERSEEING ITS IMPLEMENTATION. WE NEED A TRANSPARENT PROCESS THAT HAD BEEN FULLY VETTED BUT ALL INVOLVED STAKEHOLDERS THAT STOP FULLY ADDRESSES THE ISSUE. AND ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS THAT ARE POSED HERE TO PAY. WE ALL WANT SOUND PUBLIC POLICY TO COME OUT OF THIS EFFORT BUT IT CURRENTLY APPEARS RUSHED FOR IMPLEMENTATION IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ENCLOSING MY HOPE IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION CAN TAKE MORE TIME TO DEVELOP THIS PROPOSAL IN CONCERT WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE. ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OUTLINED HERE TODAY. AND BEFORE THE PROGRAM CAN BE IMPLEMENTED WE NEED AN ADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. OTHERWISE WE RISK PUTTING THE CART BEFORE THE HORSE AND ENDANGERING LIFE. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER MODERATOR IF WE CAN GO TO MISTER KIESLER. HE FIRED BUT CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES. I WANT TO SAY THAT I WANT TO THANK YOU THE MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND THE LEADERSHIP FOR SAVING OUR PROGRAMS IN THE LAST UDGET FIGHT EXACTLY GOVERNOR'S LAND ON THEIR BUDGET PROPOSAL BUT YOU DID WAS FALL AND ARE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED A CONCERN. THAT I HAVE HERE AND I THINK MANY OF YOU HAVE COVERAGE SAID IS ON THE PRICE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS. PARKING IS CONFLATING TWO DIFFERENT THINGS ONE IS A CRISIS REACTION TO KOBE AND THE OTHER IS THE OVERHAUL OF OUR LONG TERM CARE. SYSTEM AND THERE'S DIFFERENT THINKING THAT SHOULD BE APPLIED TO THOSE TWO DIFFERENT GOAL. IN MY FORTY YEARS AS AN ADVOCATE WORKING OF LONG TERM CARE AND HAVE A LOBBYIST- IN CALIFORNIA MANY EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO REFORM OUR LONG TERM CARE. SYSTEM VERY FEW BEEN SUCCESSFUL- LONG TERM CARE- THERE ISN'T THE COURTS STAKEHOLDERS VERY MUCH WELCOME THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE NEW BENEFIT THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HELP PEOPLE AVOID PLACEMENT AND NURSING HOMES BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF. CONCERNS THE NUMEROUS QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CURRENT PROPOSAL INCLUDING WHY IS THE ADMINISTRATION DRIVING TO HAVE A STATE PLAN AMENDMENT. SUBMITTED BY THE END OF THIS YEAR- I AM COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF ANY PARTICULAR DEADLINE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS UP AGAIN. THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED THAT THIS STATE PLAN AMENDMENT BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF THE YEAR THERE ARE OTHER WAIVERS. OTHER MEDIC CAL AGREEMENT THAT THERE ARE TIMELINE BOND I'M NOT AWARE OF ANYTHING THAT SAYS THE TASK TO BE DONE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. GOOD AND LONG LASTING REFORM WILL FOLLOW GOOD CRISIS RESPONSE. ON THE OTHER HAND BAD REFORM. CAN CREATE A NEW CRISIS. I DIRECTOR MORE SAID THAT CAN BE DONE IN BY IN. WAY BUT THE ACT. THREE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT. WILL PROVIDE THEY COLDER THERE KIND ABOUT. WANTED CRIED RESPOND TO THIS ABOUT THE- A PATH TO MEET REFORM. THE THIRD THAT WE BURKE. IS THAT THE- RAT OF THE BUDGET. ARE CLEARLY THIS. WAS POORLY TIME IN A- IT IN THE OF THE MAIN. THAT PROPOSED IMPLEMENT. DEMOCRATS P. THE- REVIEWS I THANK CARE GIVE READ CENTERS IN YOUR CHRISTIAN AGE ON THE- RESOURCE CENTERS AND BUT SERVICE. IT TOOK ME YEARS OF EFFORT BUILD UP THE M. OF THE IS AND OTHER. LONG TERM CARE PROGRAM IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO A LEMONADE OR REDUCE THESE PROGRAMS. THAT HAVE BEEN A WHOLE AND OURS SO. THAT'S ONE NOW DURING THE WHOLE BIT- AND THAT ADMINISTRATION. TOWARDS COMPLETION OF A STATE PLAN AMENDMENT BY THE END OF THE YEAR JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WHAT WE SHOULD. BE SO FOCUSED ON. CHRYSLER THREE NOW. TURNING TO THAT. PROPOSED IT'S NOT CLEAR AT ALL TRANSIT THIRD. WOULD WORK AND HOW IT WOULD WORK WAR HELLO. OR WITH EXISTING SUCCESSFUL CALIFORNIA CAN YOU TRENDS. PROGRAM BOB MANY OF US ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD BE A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL RIGHT NOW WHERE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO AUTHORIZE. THAT CCTV COMMANDING CARE CALIFORNIA COMMITTEE TRANSITIONS PROGRAM TWO THIRDS MEDICARE BENEFICIARY TO OBTAIN THEM FOR LESS THAN NINETY DAYS WE KNOW THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF. SKILLED NURSING FACILITY RESIDENTS ARE SHORTER TERM AND WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON DECOMPRESSION NOW- IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE WHY THE ADMINISTRATION WOULD BE FOCUSING ON CENTRAL VALLEY CRISIS RESPONSE. BUT I WANT TO REMIND THE ADMINISTRATION THAT THE INITIAL THIRDS WITHIN THE BAY AREA AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THE NEXT CRISIS. IS GOING TO BE AND THAT E SHOULD BE IN OUR CRISIS RESPONSE THINKING ALSO BE FOCUSED ON THE BALLOT STATEWIDE. ALREADY KNOW TO BE ABLE TO EFFECT PEOPLE GETTING. OUT OF NURSING HOME. I WAS SPECIFICALLY FOR IN HOME SERVICES PRO DURING COUNTRY NOW AND POTENTIALLY. OUT THERE BENEFIT. I AS A WEIGHT CONSUMERS TO GET MORE HOURS WHEN WE'RE STILL UNDER THREAT INSTEAD TO HAVE THE ARE YOU KEEP THE PROGRAM OUR THREE BY SEVEN PERCENT. AND THAT HOW DO THEY LOG YOU TAKE A FACT ON JULY ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY IT'S ALSO NOT CLEAR THE FIFTH COULD MAKE ARE ALREADY COMPLICATED I JUST THAT FUNDING MORE COMPLICATED- THE THAT THE RATE THAT IS BEING DESCRIBED HERE I THINK THE BUNDLE EVERYTHING INCLUDING I CHECKED THAT- IT WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE- PROPOSAL TO EXPLICITLY HOLD. COUNTY HARMLESS AND TO ALSO PROVIDE ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR THE ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES BOTH OF THE EXISTING PROGRAM AND ANY POTENTIAL NEW ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES AND THEN I WANT TO CLOSE ALSO AGAIN THEY'RE HERE ON TIMELINE IT'S NOT REALISTIC TO IMPLEMENT A STATEWIDE BENEFIT AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND CAN DO. THE RIGHT. I TOTALLY I OF WHAT DID NEED TO BE BY THE END OF THE YEAR AND WOULD AFTER THE ADMIN. WILL PROVIDE MORE INFO ON. ALSO THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IT FELT SHOULD BE MORE TRANSPARENT DIRECTOR OF WHITE BORN AND I APPRECIATE THAT HE SAID THAT THE BILL BE ISSUING THE PAPER IN SEPTEMBER AND OF THE ADDITIONAL. STAKEHOLDER MEETING BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PUBLIC THEY LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WEBSITE WHERE IT SHOWS THERE WOULD ONLY BE THREE MEDIUM AND THAT THOSE THREE MEETINGS ARE BEHIND US WITH A LAUGH HAVING DONE.

HI THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ACCOMMODATING MY SCHEDULE THANK YOU ALSO FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY HONORABLE CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS. VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION. SO I AM DENISE LIKE A VICE PRESIDENT OF INDEPENDENCE AT HOME- PAKISTAN COMMUNITY SERVICE LOS ANGELES COUNTY. WE HAVE AN MSSP PROGRAM AND OTHER SERVICES THERE TODAY MY COMMENTS WILL BE- AROUND BOTH MSF P. AND I'M ALSO REPRESENTING THE BATHS- TO DAY. IN ORDER TO BRING SOME COLOR TO THE CONVERSATION. FIRST FOR THE REACTOR IT'S A TO ECHO THE- I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE CONCERNS OF THE HONORABLE MEMBERS AND PRIOR PANELISTS. REGARDING THE LTC AT HOME BENEFIT SOMETHING THAT I WANT TO POINT OUT HERE IS. THAT THE INABILITY TO FIND THE ISSUE AT HAND WILL END WHILE ADDING FRAGMENTATION OR AN ADDITIONAL FILO INTO THE EXISTING SYSTEM A CARE. BY PROPOSING A NEW PRODUCT TO OVERLAY INSTEAD OF UNIFYING STRENGTHENING AND EXPANDING THE CURRENT PROGRAMS. AND CARE DELIVERY BY COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDERS WHO HAVE THE EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO DELIVER THE CRITICAL SERVICES IN COORDINATION NEEDED. JUST BEAMS BACKWARDS AND WHAT I APPRECIATE TODAY AND I KNOW THE NEXT PANEL WHICH WERE WHERE I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ON IS REALLY GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT A PATH FORWARD. A SHORT TERM AND I KNOW THAT THE LTSS THAT THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO SUBCOMMITTEE. SHORT TERM PLAN THAT THEY HAVE BROUGHT FORTH TODAY THAT MYCOLLEAGUE CLLR RAMSEY WILL GO INTO DETAIL NEXT ON. AND THEN ALSO THE LTFS SUBCOMMITTEE IS WORKING ON A LONGER TERM PLAN FORWARD- TO PROPOSE IN ORDER TO REALLY. STRENGTHEN AND LIFT UP WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE PROGRAMS CAN BE EXPANDED IN CAN BE MADE STATEWIDE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT WOULD NEED TO BE DONE FOR THAT. BUT LET ME TRANSITION TO. ELEMENT TRANSITION TO THE MATTER AT HAND TODAY. ON THE NEXT PANELISTS WILL YOU WILL BE DESCRIBING TO THE TWELVE RECOMMENDATIONS I BELIEVE THE CALLS ON THE BINDER THAT THE LTSS SUBCOMMITTEE. HAS BROUGHT FORTH AND UP TO DATE TODAY WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO OUR- SUPPORTING ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO. BOTH EMMA FIFTY AND THE SEA BASS MODEL OF CARE. I REALLY DO WANT TO ALSO ECHO- MY ONE OF MY FORMER BUT ONE OF THE PANELISTS COMMENT ABOUT THANKING YOU FOR YOUR- STRENGTH DURING THE BUDGET CYCLE BECAUSE. I'M A FIFTY ANTI BASS WERE TO PRO GRAMS UP FOR ELIMINATION. BUT I BELIEVE IF WE TAKE A STEP BACK. FROM THE BUDGETARY CAN. AND WE WERE LOOK AT VALUE OF THESE MODELS THERE'S MORE THAN FORTY YEARS OF DEEP KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE POPULATIONS WE SERVE AS- WELL AS KNOWLEDGE OF THE COMMUNITY AND THE GROUND LEVEL. WE KEEP PEOPLE OUT OF SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES FROM OUR WORK WHETHER IT'S IN OUR CENTER. WHETHER IT'S BEEN IN THE HOMES OR UNDER COPE ITH WHETHER IT'S BEEN IN THE ADAPTED STYLE WE HAVE BEEN DELIVERING. WE HAVE BEEN HELPING PEOPLE FOR YEARS STAY IN THE COMMUNITY. HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE FOR THOSE WHOM WE SERVE IS AT THE FOREFRONT OF BOTH PROGRAMS. THIS BECAME AN EX EXTREMELY IMPAIR UP EXTREMELY APPARENT DURING THE PANDEMIC. WE DO COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT CARE PLANS COORDINATION AND SERVICE DELIVERY WHICH ARE ALL HALLMARKS OF OUR MODEL. WE ARE INTENSIVE HIGH TOUCH TO ENSURE CRITICAL NEEDS ARE MET. TO ENABLE SUCCESSFUL LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY. WE ASSESS AND SUPPORT BOTH THE CLIENT AND THE CARE GIVER. AND I HEARD DIRECTOR LIGHT ONE TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR STABLE STRONG CARE GIVING AT HOME IN THE COMMUNITY AND HE IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. AND WE WORK WITH IHS US AND OTHER AND THE CARE GIVER RESOURCE CENTER AS WELL AS TO OUR OWN STAFF AND THEIR COMPETENCIES TO HELP SHORE UP THAT CARE GIVING. AND FOR MSSP IN PARTICULAR WHERE IS THE GAP WHERE THERE'S A GAP WE HAVE. THE ABILITY TO USE WAIVER SERVICES TO PURCHASE OF THAT GAP AND SEE BASS HAS THE ABILITY. TO BRING SERVICES TO HELP WITH THOSE GAPS. EVEN COVERED WE HAVE PIVOTED EXT. ARM OF CARE WORKING WITH THE CHALLENGES OF THE PANDEMIC TO CONTINUE. TO ENSURE HEALTH SAFETY AND WELLNESS FOR EXAMPLE THE BASS IS GOING TO CREATED THE CENTER WITHOUT WALLS. THEY'RE DELIVERING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THROUGH TELEHEALTH. EXPANDED PERSON CENTERED CARE WITH REMOTE AND IN CENTER WORK. AND THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO FURTHER THEIR RELATIONSHIP AND SUPPORT FOR THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. FOR MSSP WE'RE ALSO USING TELEHEALTH TO CONNECT AND COORDINATE. FREQUENCY OF CALLS HAVE ALSO INCREASED TO ENSURE NEEDS ARE MET. AND WE ALSO AREN'T DO FRONT PORCH VISITS TO DROP OFF CRITICAL SUPPLIES SUCH AS FOOD AT THE AS- DIRECTOR WAITED TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. ARE WAVERED SERVICES FUND THAT WHICH IS THE BEST A PORT COMPONENT OF THE NINETEEN FIFTY THREE WAIVER FOR MSSP. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO USE THAT TO SHIP TO FILL MAJOR GAPS DURING COPE AT. SUCH AS PAIN FOR SUPPLEMENTAL CARE GIVERS GIVING WHEN THE I JUST WORKER. DIED JUST CARE GIVER HAS NOT BEEN AVAILABLE. AND BEING ABLE TO KEEP THEM AT HOME AND PREVENT THEM FROM GOING. TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM BY GETTING THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. THESE MODEL ARE PROOF. AND NEEDED MORE THAN EVER. WE ARE FOSTERING CONNECTIVITY SECURITY WHILE COMBATING LONELINESS AND ISOLATION WHILE DE LEVERAGING OUR DEEP RELATIONSHIPS THAT IS FOSTERED BY OUR MODEL CARA PRINCIPLES. THE LESSON LEARNED FOR REACHING BEYOND OUR MODEL. DURING THE COPA CRISIS SHOULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED PART OF THESE PROGRAMS MOVING FORWARD. WE CAN REACH WE CAN REACH PEOPLE BETTER IN THE SITUATIONS. AND IT WOULD LEAD TO THE CONVERSATION OF HOW WE PUT THESE SERVICES MORE AND MORE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED US. WE IN THE PROPOSAL THAT YOU'LL SEE FROM THE LTFS SUB COMMITTEE THERE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND BOTH THE BATSMEN MSSP TO CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE THESE MODELS. IN NEW WAYS AND IT MOVING FORWARD YOU WILL SEE THE MSSP WE ARE ASKING FOR RATE IMMEDIATE RATE STABILIZATION AND SLOT RESTORATION. FOR THE IMMEDIATE SHORT TERM. THEREARE THE NOTE THAT THAT WOULD HELP US BE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO BE ACTIVE FOR THE RESPONDING TO COVET AND MAKING SURE OUR RATES ARE THERE TO PAY OUR PROVIDERS. S. WE EXPECT LOOKING FOR EXPEDITED ENROLLMENT PROCESS AS OUTLINED IN THE PROPOSAL THAT WILL ENABLE FASTER ENROLLMENT. CARE PLANNING AND DELIVERY OF INTERVENTIONS TO THE COMMUNITY. WHAT WE BOTH THE BATON MSSP ARE ALSO WELL POSITIONED I HEARD DIRECTOR LIGHT BORN ALSO TALK ABOUT. HOW THE MSF PNC BASSES MAY NEED TO LEVERAGE THEIR COMPETENCIES AND DIFFERENT WAYS AND POSSIBLY IT AND NEW STRUCTURES AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN TERMS OF SERVING THE STATE. WHAT THE HE BATH AN MSSP ARE ALREADY EXPERIENCED TO PROVIDE RAPID RESPONSE CARE MANAGEMENT ON THAT IF THE IN TERMS OF THE- IN THE RECOMMENDATIONS WHERE WE HAVE OUTLINED- CASE MANAGEMENT- OPTIONS TO BE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO DO THE ASSESSMENT AND HELP DO THE ANY NATIONAL CARE PLANNING AND GET PEOPLE TO THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. NOT EVERYBODY MAY NEED THE SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PRESENTED TODAY BUT WE CAN HELP IN THAT PROCESS OF BEING ABLE. TO DO THAT ASSESSMENT AND MOVE THEM FORWARD. SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR DEFINITELY ALLOWING US TO SPEAK AND REMOVE IN MY TIME SO THAT I COULD SPEAK TODAY. AND REALLY ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER THOUGHTFULLY A PATH FORWARD ESPECIALLY AS WE GO TOWARDS THE NEXT BUDGETING TO THE STATEMENT. AND FOR NOW THE BEST NUMBER TO BE STAND READY TO HELP THE STATE IN THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE ON THE GROUND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISSED LIKE OUR I WOULD LIKE TO ASK IF MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL. AND IF THEY DO I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DIRECT YOUR QUESTION TO A SPECIFIC PANELISTS. AND FOR THE PANELISTS PLEASE ON YOU YOURSELVES WHEN YOUR NAME IS CALLED AND RE MUTE. ONCE YOU'VE CONCLUDED. WE THAT. DOCTOR WHAT. JUST CUT. JUST COMMENTS PERSONAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE PANEL- VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR PERSPECTIVE AND- SPECIALLY ONCE A HIGH TO PADDY. OUT THERE. I KNOW SHE'S UP IN EUREKA HER HOPE SHE'S UP IN EUREKA BUT- AND WHO'S A REAL WHO'S BEEN A REAL EXPERT IN REAL ADVOCATE FOR- FOR- SENIORS- IT THROUGHOUT HER ENTIRE CAREER SO I THINK YOU FOR YOUR INPUT. AND WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE TAKING NOTES AND- AND I SUSPECT OTHERS ARE TAKING NOTES AS WELL BUT- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE FOR THE INFORMATION. AND THE PASSION AND WHAT YOU DO ALL OF YOU- WE'RE HERE TO SUPPORT YOU AND- SUPPORT MORE IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT THOSE PEOPLE WHO NEED WHO NEED TO THE SERVICES AND MAKE SURE WE GET THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH. CARESS I TOO WANT TO THANK OUR PRESENTERS- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BURKE IT YOU ARE VERY SPECIFIC IN YOUR FIVE CONCERNS SO I THINK THAT THOSE ARE CONCERNS WE SHARE THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THEM PUTTING THEM SOSA SIMPLY- I THINK NUMBER FIVE OBVIOUSLY IS THE ONE THAT I'M MOST CONCERNED WITH AND THAT IS THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE TO OVERSEE THE PROCESS SO EXTREMELY IMPORTANT IN ALL OF THIS. I WANT TO THANK ALSO KAREN KIESLER- I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT TO IT'S THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT- IT'S LOOKING AT THIS IS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS THE CRISIS- THEY WERE DEALING WITH THE NOW WITH COVERT AND THE OVERHAUL OF THE ENTIRE SYSTEM- AND- THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE AND DISTINCT THINGS AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT THEM THAT WAY AND TIFFANY IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO HEAR YOU. AND DO ALWAYS HERE. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE YOU SPEAK FOR FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND I HSS WORKERS. I THINK THAT IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT I WAS A WE GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS. THAT I HSS WORKERS BE INCLUDED IN THESE CONVERSATIONS BECAUSE IN THE END WE ARE GOING TO RELY ON ALL OF THOSE WORKERS TO HELP US IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM BUT I AGREE IS A WONDERFUL PROGRAM. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO DO THE WORK AND I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO RELY ON YOU AND ALL OF YOUR MEMBERS AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE AT THE TABLE WHEN WE'RE COMING TO DECISIONS REGARDING IT. SO THANK YOU ALL THREE OF YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. BALLS KEEP IT SHORT AND SWEET MISTER CHAIR REALLY LIKE TO THANK THE PANEL FOR TAKING THE TIME ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I THINK NOT JUST MYSELF BUT- ALL OF- MY COLLEAGUES TRULY APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT AND- THE QUESTIONS PRESENTED AND THE CONCERNS I THINK WE ALL SHARE THOSE AND ARE ALL LOOKING AT THOSE MOVING FORWARD SO AGAIN. THANK YOU TO THE PANELISTS. WHAT THANK THANK YOU THANK YOU UP FOR YOUR INDULGENCE I POSIT I DO WANT TO ADD ONE ONE OTHER FACTOR HERE THAT I THINK IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT- CERTAINLY- ALL EVERYBODY SITTING UP HERE RIGHT NOW IS- REPRESENT REPRESENTS AREAS WHERE THERE ARE HUGE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE ISSUES- AND- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY AS A SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS A LOT OF A LARGELY RURAL AREA A LOT OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE NOT JUST WORKFORCE BUT ALL OF THE OTHER ISSUES- TEND TO GET MAGNIFIED AND THEN WE WERE DEALING IN A CRISIS LIKE WE ARE NOW. IT'S DOUBLY MAN MAGNIFIED AND SO WE ARE AT THE END OF THE DAY ONE BE SURE WHATEVER BENEFIT WE GET IS THAT IT IS PROPER IT IS PROPORTIONATELY FAIR FOR EVERY PART OF THE STATE AND- AND SO THAT WE GET THE EVERYBODY GETS THEIR FAIR SHARE RESOURCES AND THAT IS SOMETHING WE ALWAYS STRUGGLE WITH IN OUR IN OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES AND OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THAT THAT DINNER UNDERSERVED SO. SO JUST WANT TO PUT AN EXCLAMATION POINT ON THAT PART OF IT AND THANK YOU AGAIN. THANK YOU TO WOULD BECAUSE I THINK YOU ACTUALLY BEAT ME TO- BE ADDED TO IT BECAUSE- I DO HAVE BEEN. WANTING TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE WORKFORCE TO DEAL WITH THIS IN OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES. I WANT TO FOCUS I WILL HAVE TWO QUESTIONS FOR THE PANEL AND THEY WILL BE FOR- FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURKE AS WELL AS- USE KIESLER. AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABOUT THE TIMING OF THE PROPOSAL. YOU KNOW I'MKIND OF FOCUSED ON IT I USED TO. SURGICAL TERM EARLIER IT COULD HAVE BEEN A CARPENTRY TERM AS SOMEONE REMINDED ME. BUT I DO BELIEVE THERE IS THIS IDEA THAT YOU CAN DO IT RIGHT. YOU CAN DO IT CHEAP OR YOU CAN DO IT ON TIME. YOU CAN DO TWO OF THE THREE. AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM THEM MAJORITY OF US'S LET'S SLOW DOWN THE PROCESS SO WE CAN DO IT RIGHT. AND I BELIEVE AND WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS WHAT IS OR WHAT ARE YOU REQUESTING IN TERMS OF TIMING FOR THIS PROPOSAL. I DON'T IT IS PATTY BURKE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES MA'AM. MMHM OKAY I DON'T- I MEAN I JUST THINK THERE'S A LOT OF PRELIMINARY WORK THAT HAS TO HAPPEN FIRST- YOU KNOW THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY THAT I'M AWARE OF PRELIMINARY WORK DONE TO IDENTIFY THE PATIENT POPULATION THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS BENEFIT NOR WHAT CRITERIA WILL BE USED TO DECIDE WHICH PATIENTS COULD BE SAFELY DISCHARGE. I HAVE TO SAY THAT I'VE HAD- FORTY SEVEN YEARS EXPERIENCE WITH SKILLED NURSING AND CERTAINLY CRAIG CORNET CAN ADDRESS THAT- IN A GREAT WAY BUT- I HAD TWO HIP REPLACEMENTS IF I HADN'T HAD TWENTY FOUR HOUR CARE AT HOME I WOULD HAVE HAD TO RUN INTO A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AND I'VE VISITED BROWN TO APPLYING TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AFTER HIP REPLACEMENT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYBODY AT HOME TO PROVIDE THE CARE. AND THE WORK FORCE ISSUES ARE GOING TO BE HUGE HERE AND THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS I MEAN I LOVE THAT OUR LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORT SHOP COMMITTEE HAS DEVELOPED IN THE CONCRETE RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR YOU AS IT RELATES TO WHAT WE COULD BEGIN DOING NOW AND I JUST THINK THAT THERE IS I THINK THERE LOT OF WAR OTHERWISE I MEAN I CAN ABOUT LIABILITY ISSUES I'M CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE HOME TOO QUICKLY WITHOUT THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEEDED AND- AND DYING ESSENTIALLY I AM JUST VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT I JUST THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE WE REALLY HAVE TO TAKE TIME YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THE WORK FORCE. AND THAT IS THAT IT THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE BOTH THE UNPAID CAREGIVERS ESPECIALLY AT IT AS WE'RE DEALING WITH THIS PANDEMIC AS WELL AS- AS WELL AS THOSE THAT ARE PAID CARE GIVERS- AND THERE'S A REAL SHORTAGE AND CERTAINLY IN RURAL AREAS WHERE I LIVE SO. I DO THINK WE HAVE TO GO SLOWLY I DON'T THINK WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ANYTHING TO BE ABLE TO OFFER TO DO ESSENTIALLY THE WORK THE PRELIMINARY WORK HAS TO BE DONE NOW AND THEN MAYBE WE CAN HAVE SOMETHING IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT BUT I BE TRYING TO RUSH IT WITH OUT THE LEGISLATURE BEING INVOLVED EVERY STEP OF THE WAY IS- IT IT IT JUST FELT. DISASTER COMMITTEE. I WOULD GUARANTEE WHAT WHAT CALIFORNIA. OF PUBLIC AUTHORITIES YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION WAS WHAT IS OUR OUR- SO I TO ONE IS FOR THE- TO A- WHY. THIRTY FIRST WOULD BE THERE TIME LINE. THAT YOU COMPLETE THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPOSAL AND WITH THE MEDICINE FIVE AND THE SECOND IS FOR THEM TO INCLUDE THEIR PROPOSAL AND THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET. FOR IT YOU GO THROUGH THE REGULAR BUDGET PROCESS. AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE DEVELOPMENT IN THE OUT YEARS THERE IS NO WAY THAT WE CAN DEVELOP A RESPONSIBLE STATEWIDE BENEFITS THAT. WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED NEXT YEAR. NOW I HEARD HOW DO I SUPPORT WHAT CAN JEFF BET AND THE PATTY BURKE CAN TOTAL SUPPORT THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE THAT THAT WAS OUR FIRST- OUR FIRST OBJECTIVE LOGIC AT THE EVERY STRUCTURE OF SERVICES IN PLACE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PRIOR TO DOING TRANSITION I MEAN THIS IS BIG FOR THE COLD IN THE CALL THAT CRISIS BUT- IN ADDITION HAPPENED LATE. IN THE GAME AFTER WE HAD. SERVICES IN PLACE AND THAT ALSO INCLUDES WORKFORCE. THAT'S AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT POINT- MISS BERGEN ONE THAT'S NOT LOST ON THIS COMMITTEE IS THAT DESPITE THE EFFORT. LED BY THE ADMINISTRATION IMPLEMENTATION SENATE LAWRENCE AND THAT DOES NOT APPEAR TO SHOW CAPACITY WITHIN OUR CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE I'M I HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THE QUESTION MIS KEYS LEARN TO PLAN ON ASKING THE ADMINISTRATION UNDER OUR FOURTH PANEL. AND DO BELIEVE WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS AS THE LEGISLATURE MAKING SURE THAT THIS IS PROPOSED IN THE JANUARY BUDGET AND THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE LANGUAGE TO WORK OFF OF IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO- PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY WHEN WE DON'T HAVE A TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE ACTUALLY BEFORE US THAT WE CAN SPEAK TO. SPECIFIC POINTS. RIGHT WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO. I HAVE MY FINAL QUESTION FOR THIS PANEL BEFORE MISS WHITE HOOD AND YOU KNOW I EARLIER I HAD ASKED- DIRECTOR LIGHT BORN ABOUT WHAT OUTCOMES AND METRICS HE BELIEVED NEEDED TO BE LOOKED AT. AND WANTED TO SEE IF YOU- HAD ANY SPECIFIC METRICS AND OUTCOMES THAT YOU THOUGHT SHOULD BE INCLUDED AS PART OF A NEW BENEFIT AND JUST AS A REMINDER DIRECTOR LIGHT BORN FELT THAT THE TWO PILLARS WERE HEALTH ACUITY AND ARE THEY HAPPY AND WANTED TO. BE ABLE TO SEE- IF YOU HAD ANY METRICS ARE. YOU THOUGHT WOULD BE IMPORTANT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION- RICHARD I WOULD SAY YES- DIRECTOR LIGHT GOING HEAD ON TWO PILLARS I WOULD SAY THOSE ARE PROBABLY VERY IMPORTANT- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN SEE IF THEY'RE HAPPY BUT I ALSO THINK- THAT THAT IS THE- A LARGER QUESTION. NEEDS TO BE- I DIRECTED YOU TO LOOK AT METRICS LIKE- ACCESS. TO QUALITY CARE YOU NEED TO LOOK AT YOU ALREADY BUT- EQUITY- THE EQUITY DEBT. THE THIRTY BILLION EQUITY SO WE NEED TO START LOOKING AT MEASURES THAT WE NEED TO START LOOKING AT- I THINK THAT CAN HELP BUILD INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNT OF ACCOUNTABLE AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY ASKING ARE YOU HAPPY BUT ARE YOU THE- FOR THE SERVICES THAT YOU NEED. ARE YOU RECEIVING THEM IN A TIMELY MANNER ARE YOU WHERE ARE YOU SEE THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT YOU FELT- ARE NECESSARY FOR YOUR CONDITION AND NOT JUST BEING TOLD PEOPLE ARE THEY- I THOUGHT I WOULD. JACKSON THE HOST OF QUESTIONS AND METRICS THAT NEED TO BE APPLIED- WAIT AND MET WITH SOME ACCOUNTABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE- ACTUALLY GETTING BE CONCERNED WITH THE- QUALITY. CARE THAT THEY- I AM SURE THE- WE CAN FOLLOW UP OFF. BUT PART OF THE A- ACCESS TO. CARE IS FOR US MAKE SURE WE HAVE. A WORKFORCE IS. AND BELIEVE THAT NEEDS TO BE. A LARGE PART OF THE CONVERSATION TO MAKE SURE WE CAN. WORK TOWARDS- WHAT IS CURRENTLYBEING PROPOSED. WITH THAT I DIDN'T. CHAU ONE FINAL QUESTION YES FOR MS WHITE AND- DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE ADEQUATE FEEDBACK FROM YOUR FROM THE INDIVIDUALS YOU REPRESENT WITH THE PROPOSAL TIMELINE AND HOW DO YOU FEEL THIS STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT PROCESS COMPARED TO OTHERS IN THE PAST. THANK YOU FOR THE- QUESTION I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE HAD THE ADEQUATE TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT I CAN'T LOOK AT A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS SO MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN CHECK AN EXAMPLE ON THE ON VERY IMPORTANT TO US. WE LEARNED ABOUT THE PROGRAM ON THE DAY THAT IT WAS PUT OUT LIKE THE DRAFT WE PUT OUT WE WERE TOLD ABOUT IT SO WE WEREN'T GIVEN ANY TYPE OF HEADS UP SO THAT WE CAN HAVE ANY TYPE OF INPUT HAVING THE LANGUAGE THAT OUR MEMBERS CAN ACTUALLY TAKE A LOOK AT TO THE CHECKPOINT WITH SOMETHING THAT IS VITAL TO THE DOCTOR COMES IN THAT WE CAN REFLECT DR- RATHER THAN JUST. A DRAFT. THANK YOU. WITH THAT I WANT THE THINGS THIS PANEL MOVING ON TO PENALTIES THREE DISC NURSING FACILITY RESPONSE WE WILL START WITH CLEAR RAMSEY SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY FOR JUSTICE IN AGING WE WILL THEN HAVE LIZA COLEMAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION FOLLOWED BY CRAIG CORNET CEO AND PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES MODERATOR IF YOU CAN QUEUE UP OUR FIRST PANELIST. ONE IS OPEN. THANK YOU I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND INVITED ASSEMBLYMEMBERS MY NAME IS CLAIRE RAMSEY AND I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY WITH JUSTICE IN AGING AND I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING LTSS SUB COMMITTEE I'M HERE TO DAY TO PRESENT ON THE TWELVE CRISIS RESPONSE RECOMMENDATIONS CREATED BY THE OUTFIT THAT SUBCOMMITTEE. THAT ARE SPECIFIC TO WHAT WE THINK CAN BE DONE FOR HOME AND COMMUNITY SERVICES NOW. HE CRISIS RESPONSE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS TO HELP OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AVOID A NURSING HOME PLACEMENT. ORDER SUPPORT THEM TO TRANSITION OUT OF A NURSING HOME. EXITING A NURSING HOME WITH THE GOAL OF SAVING LIVES. BY REDUCING PRESSURE IN NURSING HOMES NOW. WE CRAFTED THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THREE MAJOR CRITERIA IN MIND. FIRST WE WANTED TO MAKE USE OF OUR EXISTING HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS ACTUALLY VERY BROAD. THANK YOU WE WANTED TO BE VERY PRACTICAL AND CONCRETE NURSING IN OUR RECOMMENDATIONS. AND TO CHOOSE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COULD BE QUICKLY IMPLEMENTED. AND THIRD HE WANTED TO HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAD THE ABILITY TO BE TARGETED. TO COMMUNITIES WITH THE HIGHEST. AND WE KNEW THAT IT A LOT OF SENSE OF THAT MIGHT BE. THAT MIGHT BE COMMUNITIES BASED IN PARTICULAR HEALTH DISPARITIES AND WE THINK THESE RECOMMENDATIONS CAN BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH AND NIMBLE ENOUGH TO MEET THE NEEDS. AND WE KNOW THAT CONTAINING COVER NINETEEN SAVING LIVES IS A COMPLICATED. AND SERIOUS TASK AND WE KNOW IT REQUIRES A MULTIFACETED APPROACH BUT WE BELIEVE TE TRIAL RECOMMENDATIONS CAN BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND A CARBON IMMEDIATE SOLUTION THAT YOU ARE NOW LOOKING FOR. SO I'M GOING TO QUICKLY WALK THROUGH ITS RECOMMENDATION. THEY ARE NOT LISTED IN PRIORITY ORDER AND WHAT WE BELIEVE THEY DO BUILD UPON AND STRENGTHEN EACH OTHER WE BELIEVE THAT DOING A FEW OR SEVERAL OF THEM. WOULD ALSO BE IMPORTANT. AND HELP PEOPLE AND SAVE LIVES. TO BE GROUP RECOMMEND. INTO THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES THE FIRST CATEGORY IS THE VERSION AND TRANSITION SERVICES. TO THE FIRST YOU HEARD REFERENCE TO BY KAREN KIESLER WOULD BE TO CREATE A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY TRANSITION PROGRAM. WE ALREADY HAVE THE FIFTY P. PROGRAM THAT IS EXCELLENT. SUCCESSFUL AND COST SAVING AND WHAT WE THINK WE CAN ADD TO THAT IT'S ALLOWING IT TO WORK FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED IN NURSING HOMES FOR LESS THAN NINETY DAYS. SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT THREE MONTHS. BEFORE THEY CAN GET TRANSITION BACK HOME. CURRENTLY THERE IS ACTUALLY A VEHICLE TO DO THIS SB TWO FOURTEEN WHICH IS AUTHORED BY SENATOR DODD AND IS BEING AMENDED. TO MAKE THIS CHANGE. THANK YOU FOR RECOMMENDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMUNITY LIVING FUND WHICH WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES TO PEOPLE CAN STAY IN THEIR HOMES. AND DO NOT NEED TO GO TO NURSING HOMES IN THE FIRST PLACE DEFINED COULD SERVE NON MEDICAL. AND NON MEDICAL ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS THOSE ON MEDI CAL. AND THE THIRD ARGUMENTATION IN THIS CATEGORY IS THE RAPID RESPONSE INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT. I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY THE SAME AS WHAT- DIRECTOR LIGHT DURING HAD PROPOSED BECAUSE I'VE JUST GOTTEN THAT EMAIL WITH THAT INFORMATION TODAY. DURING THE HEARING BY. OUR IS TO BASIC USE EXISTING PROGRAMS TO FILL A SPECIFIC ROLE IN H. BE A CONTINUOUS CARE BASICALLY WORK WITH HOSPITAL DISCHARGE PLANNER TO HELP MOVE PEOPLE FROM HOSPITAL TO HOME AND MAKE SURE THEY HAVE SERVICES IN THEIR HOME FROM DAY ONE AND DO NOT HAVE A GAP WHICH COULD CAUSE INJURY OR DEATH OR- CONTINUED ELEMENT. AND WE THINK THIS COULD BE TARGETED SPECIFICALLY IT SPECIFIC COMMUNITY SO WOULD NOT HAVE TO BE THE THING IT SHOULD BE A PROGRAM USED IN EACH COMMUNITY. NEXT WE HAVE A GOOD RECOMMENDATION AROUND ACCESS TO INCREASING ACCESS TO H. C. B. S. SERVICES. AND AGAIN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS VERY CLEAR WE ARE NOT SIMPLY SUGGESTING THAT JUST SIMPLY INCREASING WHAT. IS ENOUGH BUT WE INSTEAD THINK. THAT IF WE INCREASE FOUGHT AND LEVERAGE THE FLEXIBILITY AND MAKE THE ADMINISTRATION SIMPLER AND FASTER. AND THEN TO TARGET THESE EFFORTS SPECIFICALLY DID THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED THEM WE CAN HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON SLOWING TRANSMISSION OF COBIT AND KEEPING PEOPLE SAFE IN THE HOME. THE FIRST YOU WANT TO PROPOSED. THE ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER SOUGHT BY TEN THOUSAND FOUGHT. AND INCREASING THE NUMBER OF COUNTIES. THAT ARE SERVED BY THIS PROGRAM SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO MOVE-FARTHER. YOU GET THE CARE THEY NEED WE THINK THIS IS THE QUESTION SPECIALLY NEEDED FOR THOSE WHO CANNOT LIVE ALONE OR CANNOT LIVE IN A HOME. WITH ME AND. WHO DON'T HAVE A HOME TO RETURN TO. YEAH YOU WANT TO SEE IN BY FIVE THOUSAND OF THE H. B. A WAIVER SPOT AND AGAIN WE CAN BE IN TARGET THE HOT SPOT AND THOSE PROVIDE VERY HIGH LEVEL SERVICES FOR PEOPLE COMING OUT OF NURSING HOMES OR PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE AT VERY HIGH RISK OF MOVING IN. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY CAN GIVE ADDITIONAL PERSONAL CARE SERVICES OUR WHICH ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE. NEXT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE INCREASED USAGE AND PRIORITIZATION OF HFS IS. RIGHT EXCUSE ME PULMONARY ASSESSMENT. LEADERS SUBSTANCE WHICH CAN TAKE PLACE IN HOSPITALS R NURSING FACILITIES. AND BASICALLY CAN ENSURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE AGES THAT APPROVED SERVICES TO FROM DAY ONE. OF THE RETURNED HOME. IT'S ALREADY EXISTS WE JUST THINK IT NEEDS MORE PRIORITIZATION AND ADDITIONAL. FLEXIBILITY ADDED TO IT. FOR THE RESTORED THOUGHT AND STABILIZED IN AMATEUR PRO WHICH TO THE CYCLE RT NINE. NEXT IF YOU AND FLEXIBILITY AND STABILIZE FUNDING FIRST DEVELOPED PROGRAMS WHICH CAN YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT. NEXT WOULD BE TO. INCREASE FOR CHARACTER. RESOURCE CENTER. SO THEY CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL RESPITE SERVICES TO HELP SUPPORT ALL THE UNPAID FAMILY AND FRIEND CARE GIVERS TOWARD WORKING SO TIRELESSLY DURING A PANDEMIC. AND LASTLY WOULD BE A LOT TO ALLOW FOR RAPID INVOLVEMENT IN PACE AND TO PROVIDE FOR SHORT TERM SUPPLEMENTAL WAIT. WE BELIEVE THAT COMBINATION CAN REALLY- BEEN MOBILIZED IN TARGETED WAYS THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND CAN. BE USED SPECIFICALLY WHAT COULD HELP IN PARTICULAR AREAS AND EVERYTHING DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE. LASTLY ONE HAVE A GROUP OF CATEGORIES EXCUSE ME A GROUP OF pOF INCREASING HEALTH AND SAFETY. WE WANT TO RECOMMEND THAT WE REQUIRE HOGAN TESTING BEFORE SOMEONE MAKE THE HOSPITAL WHICH IS NOT REQUIRED RIGHT NOW. WHETHER THEY'RE ABOUT TO GO HOME OR TO A FACILITY TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CARING FOR THEM CAN TAKE CORPORATE PRECAUTION AND THAT THE PEOPLE LEAVING THE HOSPITAL CAN BE APPROPRIATELY CARED FOR. UNLESS WE WANT TO RECOMMEND INSURING ADEQUATE PP FOR IT SHOULD BE A PROVIDER. LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO NEED THE SERVICES AND THE PEOPLE PROVIDING THE SERVICES ARE PROTECTED FROM INFECTION. I KNOW I'VE JUST COVERED A LOT OF INFORMATION VERY QUICKLY BUT I'M VERY HAPPY TO ANSWER SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT ANY OF THESE AFTER THE OTHER PANELISTS HAVE PRESENTED. AND I THINK LTSS COMMITTEE A WHOLE JUST WANTED THEY WERE VERY PROUD TO OPERATE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS BECAUSE WE DO THINK THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO REALLY. BE IMMEDIATE AND TO HELP PEOPLE RIGHT NOW DURING THE TOTAL PRICE OF AND TO REALLY STATEWIDE OF OUR OLDER CALIFORNIANS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. THANK YOU AND THAT ALL PASSENGERS ANALYSTS. THANK YOU MISS RAMSEY IF WE CAN. OF MISS COLEMAN NEXT. CHEN AND I'M LEAST ALLMAN WITH CAL ALONG TO CARE ABOUT SAYS. AND I WANT TO YOU FOR HAVING THIS. I'M TRULY WANT TO SAY LINE. OF THOSE LIVING AND WORKING IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES AND WE REALLY HAVE TO FOCUS ON PROVIDING RESOURCES. AND I WOULD SAY THE FIRST RESOURCES OMBUDSMEN. I'M INCIDENTS HAPPEN WILL CONTINUE TO DO AS MUCH POSSIBLY OVER THE PHONE. THE FOR ELDER ABUSE INVESTIGATIONS AND OTHER COMPLAINTS AND IN PERSON OPTIONS WITH APPROPRIATE PP SHOULD BE MORE THAN ALLOWED. HIS VILLAGE THESE VISITS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED EIGHT A C. CL THE STATE OMBUDSMAN OFFICE HAVE SAID THAT OMBUDSMAN'S CAN RESUME IN PERSON. VISITS FOLLOWING SPECIFIC GUIDELINES. AND I WAS ENCOURAGED TO HEAR- THIS WAY TALKING ABOUT REACHING OUT WITH LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH. TO ENSURE THAT THAT HAPPENS. I WOULD ASK THAT BECAUSE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES HAVE VERY VERY VERY DIVERSE MANDATE. EVEN THOUGH CPCC ALLEN STATE OMBUDSMAN HAVE SAID OFFICE WE CAN GO BACK IN THE BUILDINGS LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH- HAVE VERY. DIFFERENT OPINIONS ON THIS AND I WOULD ASK THAT. THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE CDA AND AGENCIES TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ON BEHALF OF THE PROGRAM. IT SHOULD NOT BE UP TO THE INDIVIDUAL OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM TO CONVINCE THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER OF THEIR VITAL ROLE. SECOND RESOURCE FACILITY STAFFING. YOU KNOW EVEN DURING A PANDEMIC BOTH INDUSTRY AND DEPARTMENT LEADERS JUSTIFIED THE CONTINUING UTILIZATION OF CARE STAFF WHO WORK IN MULTIPLE FACILITIES. WE SEEMINGLY NO REGARD TO THE FACT THAT CARE STAFF AT WITH NO WENT MALICE INTENT. ARE SPREADING CODE NINETEEN FROM FACILITY TO FACILITY AND EVEN CROSSING COUNTY LINES. WE SHOULD REQUIRE FACILITIES AS THEY ARE CURRENTLY GETTING HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR MEDICARE AND HEALTH PLANS TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO COVER A POSITIVE RESIDENTS. THAT THEY USE THIS MONEY TO INCREASE STAFFING. FACILITIES NEED TO BE INCENTIVIZED EXCUSE ME FACILITIES NEED TO INCENTIVIZE STAFF TO WORK AT ONE FACILITY BY PAYING A PROFESSIONAL HEALTH CARE WGE. AND AUTHORIZING OVERTIME. THE STATE NEEDS BE RE FOR PAY ROLLED JOURNAL TO SEE HOW THE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT ON STAFFING. WE NEED TO PUT PRESSURE ON CMS TO ROLL BACK THE HOLIDAY ON DATA REQUIREMENTS NO MORE ON OUR SYSTEM OF SELF REPORTING WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE FACTS ARE. THE THIRD RESOURCE ARE UNPAID CARE GIVERS WE NEED TO ALLOW VISITORS TO HELP WITH CARE THOSE VISITORS WHO CAP WITH CARE TO RESUME FACILITY VISITS. I WOULD ARGUE THAT THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST CRUEL ASPECT OF OUR WELL INTENDED IN WELL INTENDED APPROACHES TO MANAGING COVE IN. THIS MORNING I MADE THE MISAKE OF ANSWERING THE PHONE CALL. FROM A WOMAN THE LACK I WISH I COULD JUST HAVE BROUGHT YOU HERE I BROUGHT HER HERE TO SHARE HER STORY ON MARTHA'S HUSBAND HAS BEEN IN THE FACILITY FOR A FEW YEARS IT WASN'T A GREAT FACILITY VPN LEFT. BUT IT WAS CLOSE TO HER HOME IT WAS CLOSE TO A PARK IT WAS CLOSE TO AT A MOVIE THEATER SHE CAN WIELD THEM TO IN HIS WHEELCHAIR. A CO THAT HIT AND OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS SHE'S WATCHED FROM A WINDOW. AS HE'S LOST WEIGHT SHE DOESN'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY POUNDS BUT SHE GUESSES OVER TWENTY BECAUSE SHE'S NOT IN THAT ROOM. PROMPTING HIM TO EAT ENCOURAGING HIM WITH TASTY TREATS AND JUST SPENDING TIME TALKING TO HIM AS HE EATS HIS MEAL. SHE HASN'T BEEN IN HIS ROOM MASSAGING HIS LEGS AND HIS HANDS THE THIRTY AND FORTY MINUTES SHE WOULD DO EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND INSTEAD SHE'S WATCHED OUTSIDE THE FACILITY. AS HIS UPPER BODY. THE SIDE THAT WAS DAMAGED FROM THE STROKE. IT'S AFTER FAILING TO THE POINT NOW WHERE SHE DOESN'T THINK HE'LL EVER BE IN A WHEELCHAIR AGAIN. WE KNOW THAT. THERE'S A RISK BRINGING VISITORS IN. BUT NOT ALLOWING THEM TO COME IN HASN'T IMPROVED OF THE RISK AT ALL WHAT WE KNOW IN JUNE WHEN I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK BEFORE THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. THERE WERE SEVENTY ONE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN THE STATE BUT ALREADY RECORDED TEN OR MORE DEATHS WE HAVEN'T LET RIGHT WE HAVEN'T LETTER VISITORS IN AND YET NOW EIGHT WEEKS LATER WE'RE AT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX FACILITIES THAT HAVE GREATER THAN TEN RESIDENTS OR STAFF THAT IT DIED FROM CALVET. WE NEED TO BRING THE HUMANITY OF BRINGING LOVED ONES BACK INTO THE BUILDINGS. THESE ON KATE UNPAID CARE GIVERS NEED PP THEY NEED PP TRAINING. THEY NEED TO BE SUBJECTED TO THE SAME KOPET TESTING AS FOR THE REST OF THE STAFF. WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO INCREASE STAFFING. INCREASE TESTING. TESTING FOR BOTH THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAMS IS ESSENTIAL WORKERS TESTING FOR UNPAID CAREGIVERS AND ALSO INCREASING THE TESTING OF STAFF SO THAT WE IDENTIFY THE- A SYMPTOMATIC CARE GIVERS. I WOULD SAY IN ADDITION MY FINAL SUGGESTION AS THAT THE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO PROVIDE AN APPEAL PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT VISITORS AND- AND RESIDENTS WHO WANT TO HAVE VISITS. THAT THAT PROCESS IS FAIR AND THAT THERE'S A METHOD FOR CASE BY CASE REVIEW ALLOWING FAMILY WISH TO VISIT WITH THEIR LOVED ONES OR OR RESIDENTS WHO WISH TO HAVE VISITORS. IN RESPONSE TO BE EXPANDING. UP IN HOME PROGRAMS FOR FOUR YEARS WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO EXPAND THE ASSISTED LIVING WAIVER HOW. WHAT WHAT BETTER POSITION WE WOULD BE IN TODAY IF WE HAD HAD THAT PROGRAM EXPANDED ALL OF THE COUNTIES IN THE ADDITIONAL SLOTS. AND WITH REGARDS TO THIS AT HOME BENEFIT ONE OF THE MAJOR ACTIVITIES THE OMBUDSMAN'S PLAY REGULARLY IS ASSISTING RESIDENTS WITH LEAVING THE FACILITY AND GOING HOME. AND YET THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM WAS NOT INVITED IN AS A PART OF THE STAKEHOLDER AND LEARNED ABOUT THIS PROGRAM WHEN IT WAS BEING PUBLISHED JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. SO WE ASK THAT WE BE INCLUDED IN THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. THIS INDUSTRY CAN DO BETTER AND THE RESIDENTS WHO LIVE IN THESE FACILITIES THEY NEED THEM TO DO BETTER. THE LOCAL LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM STANDS READY AS WORKING PARTNERS TO HATE TO HELP MAKE IT BETTER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS COLEMAN. BUT YOU'VE ALWAYS DONE A TREMENDOUS JOB OF BRINGING VOICE FOR THOSE WHO ARE VULNERABLE. AND THEN NURSING HOMES AND THANK TODAY WAS NO EXCEPTION. THANK YOU SIR. MAXTA MISTER CORNET. THANK YOU ARE THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS CRAIG CORNET I'M THE CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES. PROFESSIONAL TRADE ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS OVER NINE HUNDRED SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AND MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITY FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE COMMENT TODAY LIKE FORMER ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURKE KAREN KIESLER CLAIRE RAMSEY AND THE NEEDS LIKE- I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF THE LTSS SUB COMMITTEE AND I ENDORSE THE COMMENTS YOU'VE HEARD EARLIER ABOUT THAT LONG TERM CARE HOME PROPOSAL. I'LL IN ADDITION A LOT OF SHARE CAPTAIN GESTURED FOR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY PATIENTS EMPLOYEES TO COMBAT. BOKO THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. I LIKE THE FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AT THE TREMENDOUS AND HI COROLLA OF ALL THE LONG CARE. CARE GIVERS THAT ARE STATE TO TRY THEIR VERY EVERY DAY TO KEEP OUR PRATTVILLE ELDERLY POPULATION SAFE AND PROTECTED. SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN PARTICULAR PANDEMIC HAS BEEN NOTHING LIKE WE'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE IT HAS BEEN DESTRUCTIVE. IN INSIDE OUR BUILDINGS THAT HAVE BEEN DESTRUCTIVE TO OUR RESIDENTS TO OUR FAMILY AND TO OUR STAFF. IN THE BEGINNING NO ONE KNEW THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT WOULD AFFECT PATIENTS AMERICAN. IN WITH TO DAY ESTATE. ATTEMPT ON TEMPTED UNDERSTAND THE VIRUS AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS. SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES HAVE STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE AND WE ARE NOW SEEING SIGNIFICANT CLIENT I WOULD PROVE DETECTION. CONTAINMENT AND PREVENTION. BUT THERE IS STILL MORE WORK TO DO THAT WILL REQUIRE CONTINUED STATE SUPPORT FOR THEIR SUCCESS. I DO APPRECIATE THE STATE'S GOLDFIELD CREATED WITH THIS LONG TERM CARE AT HOME PROPOSAL WHICH ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE ADDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES CAN BE CARED FOR AT HOME. MY ORGANIZATION HAS ALWAYS SUPPORTED THE PROMISED THE PATIENT SHOULD BE IN THE MOST APPROPRIATE SETTING POSSIBLE. TO INSURE THEIR HEALTH AND WELL BEING. I AM HOW COULD THAT MOVING TOO QUICKLY ON THE PROPOSAL AS YOU'VE HEARD. COULD HAVE IMPACTS THROUGHOUT THE LONG TERM NEGATIVE IMPACTS THROUGHOUT THE LONG TERM CARE CONTINUE. AS THE LEGISLATURE LOOKS TO CONSIDER A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS IN THE COMING MONTHS I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOUR CONSIDERATION THE FOLLOWING. FIRST WORKFORCE CHALLENGES IN THE SECTOR AND THROUGHOUT THE LONG TERM CARE CONTINUE UP OUR A BATCH. THE STATE NEEDS TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE IN PROVIDING INCENTIVES FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND STREAMLINING OF TRAINING. FOR LONG TERM CARE GIVERS. NUMBER TWO THE STATE SHOULD EVALUATE HOW IT CONFERS BETTER SUPPORT AND ENHANCE THE EXISTING LONG TERM CARE MODELS THAT ALREADY PROMOTE IN HOME. HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS YOU'VE HEARD THAT FROM OTHERS. NUMBER THREE THE STATE SHOULD PRIORITIZE OPTIONS FOR PATIENT CURRENTLY IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT DO NOT HAVE GOOD RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENT DUE TO THEIR MENTAL HEALTH CREE INCOME NEED. ALLOWED A FOURTH ITEM HERE WITH A BIG INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. THAT IS OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND GOOD QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY MEASUREMENT SYSTEM. WE STILL DON'T KNOW HOW THOSE WOULD WORK IN A LONG TERM CARE HOME PROPOSAL THEY ARE HOWEVER ESSENTIAL AND MUST BE AT LEAST AS STRONG AS WHAT WE. HAVE IN CONGREGATE CARE SETTING. I WOULD BE ABLE TO PROTECT IN THE L. T. S. SUB. DISCUSSION REGARD THE I'D FOR A MERGER CHEAPEST. TO THE CURRENT CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. CATHOLIC PORTS WHICH SUGGESTION THAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM CLAIRE AND OTHERS TOOK A MOMENT AGO. AT THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED IN PARTICULAR THOUGH I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE FOLLOWING ITEMS THAT MOST BUT WOULD BE MOST BENEFICIAL. IS STILL NURSING FACILITIES FIRST INCREASING HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR SKILLED NURSING READ THAT THROUGH APPROPRIATE TESTING AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR HEALTH CARE WORKERS THAT IS ESSENTIAL. ADDRESSING THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEM IS MOST CRUCIAL TO KEEPING OUR NURSING FACILITY PATIENTS SAFE. IN ADDITION. YOU HEARD ALREADY IT'S IMPORTANT AT ALL STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORS BE SCREENED AND TESTED IF THEY'RE GOING TO IT WHATEVER THE INTEREST A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY THIS IS AN ISSUE WE TALK TO THE STATE ABOUT FOR A NUMBER OF MONTHS. I'M MORE GLAD TO KNOW THAT THE STATE OF NEW PORT ON THAT. BUT THIS IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. NUMBER THREE INCREASING ACCESS TO AN EXPANDING THE CURRENT HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS THAT CAN PROVIDE HOME BASED HEALTH SERVICES WITH THE MOST IMMEDIATE AND EFFECTIVE MEANS. TO SUPPORT INCREASES IN HOME CARE. K. JUST HE WOULD AYE THAT WE BELIEVE WILL HAPPEN TO ME POSITIVE AND ON NURSING HOME PATIENTS. THESE INCLUDE. GREATER ACCESS FOR NURSING FACILITIES TO CALL THE NINETEEN TESTING THAT PROVIDES TIMELY RESULT. TESTING IS GETTING BETTER BUT THERE ARE STILL MANY HURDLES THAT WOULD THAT REMAIN. I WANTED TO ALSO THANK-% CHAIRMAN OF DARIAN PLEASE COMMENT ABOUT THE PRIORITY OF TESTING. I BEING AT LEAST WHERE IT IS IN A CUTE KERR HOSPITAL THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR QUITE SOME TIME. AT THIS POINT. NOW THAT WE ARE SEEING TIMING THE TIME IT TAKES TO GET TEST RESULTS BACK. HADN'T HAVE BEEN CREATED LITTLE TOO LATE AND CASTING THAT WE CANNOT GET A RESULT BACK WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS OR. LESS IT'S REALLY NOT VERY EFFECTIVE. FEDERAL AND STATE WERE. ARE OFTEN NOT AND- WE HAVE CMF PROVIDING CERTAIN- AND FUNDING FOR POINT OF CARE TESTING DEVICES RIGHT NOW. WHILE THE STATE AND SOME COUNTY REQUIRING LAB TESTING. IN EITHER CASE. THERE ARE THEY ARE REIMBURSEMENT QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THE HELL WHO WILL COVER THESE COSTS. ACTUALLY FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENSURE DEDICATED TP FIFTY KILLED NURSING FACILITIES HEALTH CARE WORKERS- IS AVAILABLE AND ACCESS TO BP HAS IMPROVED BUT THERE ARE STILL GAPS AND PRODUCTS SHORTAGES ON A REGULAR BASIS WE ARE PARTICULARLY WORRIED ABOUT THE SITUATION IN THE FALL. WITH REGARD TO CERTAIN CERTAIN ITEMS QUICKLY GLOVES. THE STATE COULD REQUESTED REQUIRE THE STATE SHOULD REQUIRES- THE ACCOUNT NEEDS TO HAVE A DESIGNATED OFFICER INDIVIDUAL THAT NAVIGATE ALL TRANSFERS FROM HOSPITAL TO CLOSE TO KEEP. CARE SETTINGS HELPING TO INFORM THE HOSPITAL DISCHARGE TRANSPLANTING APPROPRIATE HOME BASED ARE IMPATIENT OPTION A CO GOOD POSITIVE PATIENTLY SPECIAL. ANOTHER ISSUE THERE SHOULD BE AT LEAST A SINGLE WEBSITE OUR PROVIDER PORTAL THATIS A REPOSITORY FOR ALL PANDEMIC INFORMATION. WEBSITE SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT FOR EVERYONE FOR CARE GIVERS FOR FAMILY TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THEPRESS. IT SHOULD INCLUDE ALL COUNTY STATE AND FEDERAL INFORMATION ON A SINGLE FIGHT PARTICULARLY THE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT REGULATORY STRUCTURES WHICH- FRANKLY AT THIS POINT ARE VERY UNCLEAR TO THE PROVIDER- GIVEN THE OVERLAP AND ALSO TO THE PUBLIC. AS I MENTIONED EARLIER ALL THE REGULATORS NEED TO BE TESTED BEFORE ENTERING AND LASTLY BUT NO LESS IMPORTANT. THE STATE'S OING TO HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME FUNDING FOR NURSING FACILITIES TO COVER THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. LIABILITY AND COMP WORKER'S COMPENSATION INSURANCE RATES DURING THE PANDEMIC. NURSING HOME FACILITIES- RATES ARE SKYROCKETING FOR PANDEMIC COVERAGE AND THAT IS. A THAT IF YOU COULD SELL EITHER EVEN LUCKY ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO GET ACTUAL COVERAGE WHICH IS AT QUICKLY NOT EVEN OFFERED ANYMORE. MORE SLEEP WITH THE NOT. GUILTY FOR NOT FINDING CARRIERS WHO WILL COVER THEIR LIABILITY OF WORKERS COMP RISK RELATED TO CODE THAT. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING TODAY I APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY THOUGHTFUL EXAMINATION. OF HOW THE STATE CAN MOST SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY CARE FOR A VULNERABLE ELDERLY POPULATION. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED DISCUSSION. THANK YOU MISTER CAR. I WILL NOW ASK FOR. MEMBER TO SEE IF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL. AND I WOULD AGAIN ASK YOU TO DIRECT THEM TOWARDS A SPECIFIC PANELISTS. AND FOR THE PANELISTS TO THEN ON MUTE YOURSELF ONCE YOU AND THEN WE MEET YOURSELF ONCE YOU'VE CONCLUDED. MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. SINAN I WILL. TAKE A CHANCE IF I CAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. THANK YOU MISTER CARROLL ALL THE STATE AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO THANK THE PANELISTS FOR POINTING OUT VERY SPECIFIC THINGS- YOU KNOW. DISCUSSING THE STAFFING ISSUES- I KNOW IN MY DISTRICT WE HAD A LOT OF ISSUES EARLY ON WITH- STAFF HAVING TO WORK MULTIPLE JOBS- AND WORKING ON MULTIPLE FACILITIES IN IN DEALING WITH THE SPREAD. OF CALVET WHERE IT'S JUMPING FROM FACILITY TO FACILITY BECAUSE- STAFF FOR HAVING TO WORK MULTIPLE JOBS I THINK THAT GETS TO THE BIGGER CONVERSATION OF. THE ECONOMY AND OTHER THINGS BUT- IT DEFINITELY GETS INTO THE DISCUSSION OF HOW WELL WE ARE- PAIN IN TAKING CARE OF THESE PEOPLE WHO TAKE CARE OF OUR LOVED ONES- THE CONVERSATION IN REGARDS TO VISITS- CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY. PHONE CALLS I'VE HAD FROM CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE CRYING BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO VISIT- THEY'RE GIVEN A WINDOW VISIT WITH A TINTED WINDOWS. ANOTHER REALLY GOOD POINT I THINK THAT WAS MADE MISTER CHAIR. WAS BY MISS COLEMAN ON THE SELF REPORTING I THINK THAT'S A BIG ISSUE- REALLY QUESTION FOR ALL THE PALACE THAT I WOULD HAVE IS WHAT WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON. GIVING THE COUNTIES. A LITTLE MORE TEETH IN REGARDS TO. OVERSIGHT AND THE ABILITY TO SHUT DOWN FACILITIES THAT- OR BAD ACTORS BECAUSE I KNOW SOME OF THE FACILITIES THAT WE HAD HAD VERY VERY POOR REPORTS THE STATE IT HAD GOING IN MULTIPLE TIMES. TO PROVIDE RETRAINING TO ADJUST FIRE ON SOME OF THESE NURSING HOMES AND- WE'RE ACTUALLY INVESTIGATING ONE OF THEM. SO YOU KNOW IF THE COUNTY HAD THAT ABILITY TO GO IN AND SHUT THEM DOWN OR TO GO IN AND TAKE CONTROL- OF ON THE IN ANY OF YOUR OPINIONS DO YOU THINK THAT THAT WOULD HELP. FOR THOSE SELECT FEW FACILITIES THAT ARE THE BAD APPLES THAT OR THE BAD PLAYERS- THEY AND I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THE COMMENTS MADE- WE'VE ALL DONE A LOT OF WORK TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TESTING AND TESTING SITES WE'VE HAD. COMPANIES LIKE CVS EVEN STEP UP. TO DO DRIVE THROUGH TESTING. BUT IT REALLY COMES DOWN TO THIS RESULT BACKLOG THAT WERE ALL SEEN IN THE FACT THAT IT'S TAKING TWO TO THREE WEEKS TO GET RESULTS. AND BY THE TIME YOU TAKE THETEST TO GET THE RESULTS YOU COULD'VE ALREADY GOT IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. SO BUT I SEE THE HUGE ISSUE THERE S- BUT AGAIN WITH THE SELF REPORTING WHAT CHANNELS WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS. ON GIVING COUNTIES THAT ABILITY TO STEP IN WHEN THERE'S A BAD ACTOR. OF ADMIT THAT IS QUITE CORNET I WOULD JUST TELL YOU THAT THAT THEY HAVE THAT ABILITY NOW ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND IN MOST CASES THE COUNTY. BOARD WITHIN COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT I'M VISITING KRING REGULARLY UNTIL I AM YEAH THEY THEY DO NOT HAVE THAT ABILITY BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN- SOME THAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED BACK IN MARCH WITH ONE OF MY FACILITIES WE LOOKED INTO THAT AND THEY DO NOT HAVE THE- POWER TO. TO DO THAT OR TWO OF REGULATE THEM ON ANY LEVEL THAT THAT'S BEEN AN ISSUE THAT WE. DISCOVERED IN MARCH SO. I WOULD THAT YOU IF YOU WANT CORRECT THAT THE- BEEN CUT I'M AWARE OF THAT HAS HAPPENED IN COUNTY CALIBER. AND I THINK DOWN IN THE WAY IF YOU THAT AREA SOME THE RATES. THAT HAVE IN AND WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE THEY ARE THEY ARE IN MANY COUNTIES REGULATE THAT THAT PUBLIC HEALTH. KERR SO BUT I GUESS I WOULD SAY T. DO IT ALSO A LOT THERE'S A LOT MORE OVERSIGHT NOW THAN THERE HAS SPENT ALSO THE- CDPH THE SURVEYORS. ARE NOW VISITING FACILITIES GOOD SO HE HAD SUBMIT A MITIGATION PLANS TO THE STATE IN JUNE- CDPH IS NOW FOLLOWING UP THEY HAVE TO APPROVE THE MITIGATION PLANS AND THEY ARE MAKING. REGULAR VISITS TO THE FACILITIES TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE KEEPING BURKE MITIGATION PLANS ON TRACK. AGAIN AND MANY COUNTY. AS I AS I MENTIONED I KNOW I KNOW MANY CALORIES THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THIS THING I CAN'T. TELL YOU THAT IN EVERY COUNTY BUT I KNOW THAT ANSWER QUITE QUITE. GREG VERY SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU ARE YOU DO REPRESENT- MANY OF. THESE FACILITIES. WE WILL IF WE WERE TO DESIGN A- ANY ANY KIND OF A FOR THE COUNTY TO HAVE. ON IS THE PROBLEM THAT I'VE SEEN IS THAT BY THE TIME THE STATE RESPONSE IS IT'S JUST TAKES TOO LONG. AND WITH THE COUNTY IS BEING RIGHT THERE ON THE GROUND- OBVIOUSLY THERE HAVE BETTER ACCESS AND A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT GET THE COMPLAINTS ARE ARE USUALLY THE LOCALS- AND BY THE TIME IT GETS TO THE STATE LEVEL- THERE'S ALREADY A SERIOUS ISSUE SO. FROM YOUR FROM YOUR VIEWPOINT SIR WHAT WOULD YOU SEE IT AS A- TO GIVE THE COUNTY BETTER OVERSIGHT TO GIVE THEM ACTUAL SOME TEETH- TO ENSURE THAT THE BAD ACTORS THAT. QUITE FRANKLY SIR MAKE YOUR ORGANIZATION LOOK BAD- WHAT WOULD THAT BE. WHAT WHAT OKAY SORRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER THERE ARE IN SOME COUNTIES. THE COUNTIES WILL PUT IT MISSION BAND ON THE FACILITY IF THEY ARE CONCERNED AND THEY WILL SAY NO NO ADDITIONAL ADDITION UNTIL UNTIL- YOU KNOW WE SEE CERTAIN LEVELS OF IMPROVEMENT THAT HAPPENED. THAT HAPPENED DIRECTLY I WILL TELL YOU THE ONE THE THINGS THAT IS MOST CONCERNING US ABOUT. IT FREQUENTLY THE LACK OF COORDINATION. WE SEE A NORM AS I MENTIONED EARLIER THERE THERE'S DIFFERENT GUIDANCE IN COMBAT ALL OVER THE PLACE AND FISCALLY FREQUENTLY FIND IT VERY CONFUSING BECAUSE THEY MAY BE GETTING ONE SET OF GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DIFFERENT THAT TO THE STATE. AND A DIFFERENT THAT FROM FROM THE COUNTIES SO ONE CONCERNED WE'VE HAD FROM THE GET GO IF THE EQUIPMENT IS THE LACK OF COORDINATION AT THE DIFFERENT GOVERNMENTAL LEVELS BUT A LOOK. AT ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS THIS THIS IS LISA CALLING MAY I RESPOND TO THIS YES PLEASE. YEAH I WOULD ECHO PART OF WHAT A GREAT JUST SAID ABOUT THE INCONSISTENCY AND MESSAGING. AND THAT THAT INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE FEDERAL THE STATE AND THE LOCAL HAS CAUSED GREAT FRUSTRATION AND HARDSHIP AND CONFUSION AND IN SOME. CASES HAS MADE. HAS MADE THE CITY WORSE. WE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS IS BEING DOWN. THAT THAT'S THAT'S VERY EXTREME SITUATION AND WE WOULD HOPE IT WOULD NEVER GET TO THAT- MY ALL MY ALWAYS GO TO RESPONSES THAT WE NEEDED OMBUDSMAN'S IN THESE BUILDINGS AND THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SUCH DIVERSE. LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH IS IN PART OF THE PROBLEM AS TO WHY WE HAVEN'T HAD ON BUT SINCE GOING BACK INTO THE BUILDINGS BECAUSE THEY SEE THESE THINGS WHEN IT'S SMALL. AND THEY ARE DOES I MEAN THE WHOLE FOCUS IS TO DO INTERVENTION BEFORE THESE BECOME BIG PROBLEMS. SO GETTING THE OMBUDSMAN'S BACK IN I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD SAY GIVING LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH MORE TEETH I WOULD SAY A BETTER COMMUNICATION OF MESSAGE BETWEEN. THE AGENCY AND LOCAL PUBLIC OUT WOULD HELP A LOT. I I'M I WON'T FIND FAULT WITH LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE POPULATION. WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHAT PERCENTAGE IS IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES IT'S PROBABLY LESS THAN 1% OF THEIR OVERALL POPULATION AND SO TO EXPECT THEM TO BE EXPERTS IN LONG TERM CARE IS PROBABLY AN UNREALISTIC EXPECTATION. BUT A GOOD SOLUTION I THINK WOULD BE TO HAVE A LONG TERM CARE EXPERT ON THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH TEAM. AND SAID THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. MORE ACCURATE INPUTS ARE ACCURATE UNDERSTANDING OF. OF AT. AN OUTBREAK THIS GOING ON IN A NURSING HOME. THANK YOU THAT THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT IT'S I ASK THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WE HAD A. ONCE IT WAS REPORTED. A IN REALLY YOU YOU ALL KNOW HOW THESE THINGS IF YOU KNOW OF BLOWS UP AND IT'S A NEW STORY AND ALL OF SUDDEN IT'S LIKE WHAT HAPPENED HERE. WE FIND OUT THAT WE HAD A FACILITY THAT. HAD HORRIBLE GRADES FROM. THE APARTMENT AT THE STATE LEVEL. AND THEN YOU ASK THE COUNTY AND THEY TURN AROUND AGO WELL IT'S LICENSE THROUGH THE STATE. SO SOME WOMEN WE NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF IT BECAUSE IT'S AT THE STATE LEVEL. BECAUSE A LOT OF OUR OUR COUNTIES LIKE YOU SAID AREN'T USED TO DEALING WITH THESE POPULATIONS. AND THEY LOOK AT OKAY WHO HOLDS THE LICENSE BECAUSE WHOEVER HOLDS THE LICENSE HOLDING THE POWER OVER THEM. AND I WOULD AGREE HAVING MORE ODD BUT IT'S BEEN HAVING SOMEBODY THERE. WOULD DEFINITELY HELP WITH THESE IN I DON'T MEAN TO YOU KNOW GOING IN AND SHUT THEM DOWN BECAUSE WE WANT TO SEE THESE OPEN WE WANT TO SEE THEM BE GOOD PLAYERS WHO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE KEEPING FACILITIES IN OUR COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY IN OUR- COLLECTIVE RURAL. AREAS OF THAT FOR THIS COMMITTEE REPRESENTS- BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE WAYS. WHERE THAT INFORMATION'S COMING OUT CENTER WHERE IT'S COMING OUT FASTER. AND WHERE YOU KNOW IF THERE IS SOMEBODY WITHIN THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT WHERE WE CAN SET THE REGULATIONS WHERE EVERY COUNTY IS DOING IT THE SAME WAY AND HAS THAT SAME STANDARD OF CARE THEN THEY CAN ACTUALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO TELL THAT FACILITY HEY HERE'S HERE'S WHERE YOU'RE MESSING UP THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO AND MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE IT THIS THE STOP. GAP BETWEEN. THAT FACILITY IN A RURAL AREA IN CALIFORNIA. GOING BACK TO THE STATEMENT COMING BACK DOWN. IT'S TAKING TOO LONG AND PEOPLE ARE DYING. BUT I DON'T EVER WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN AGAIN SO. AND I KNOW THIS HAPPENED IN MY DISTRICT WHICH IS WHY I CARE A LOT ABUT IT BECAUSE TO ME THEY SHOULD NEVER HAPPENED WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THESE PEOPLE ARE GETTING A RATING OF LITERALLY A ONE OUT OF FIVE. IN FRANKLY THAT THEY SUCK AT WHAT THEY WERE DOING. YET THEY WERE STILL OPEN. SO I JUST HAVE TO THINK OF HOW DO WE MAKE THE SYSTEM BETTER- YOU KNOW WITH THE LIKE YOU SAID PUTTING ON BUDGET WITHIN THEIR HAVING THAT PERSON AT THE COUNTY WOULD HELP BUT IT COMES INTO. SABALLY HAS AS WE SEE TOO OFTEN AS POLICYMAKERS UNLESS THERE'S A MECHANISM IN THERE. TO CREATE A AN ACTUAL PENALTY THAT WILL YOU KNOW GIVE THEM REASON TO ACTUALLY BE GOOD PLAYERS- SADLY THERE ARE SOME OUT THERE THAT WON'T DO IT UNLESS THERE IS A PUNISHMENT MECHANISM- HANGING OVER THEIR HEADS. BUT THERE BUT THERE IS WE DO HAVE THE- QUALITY ACCOUNTABILITY FUND THAT IS UP FOR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- THAT. THAT BILL THAT FUNDING SOURCE PROVIDES A FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION. WARD TWO FACILITIES PROVIDING GOOD QUALITY CARE WHY DON'T WE DO A SERIOUS RE WORK OF THAT FUND AND WE PROVIDE A BONUS TO FACILITIES THAT ARE DOING A GREAT JOB THEY DON'T FAIL AT THINGS LIKE HAND WASHING AND INFECTION PROTOCOLS THAT WE REWARD FACILITIES THAT AREN'T USING CARES. AND PAY A LIVING HEALTH CARE WAIT AND NOT HAVING TO UTILIZED A CARE WAIVER THERE ARE THINGS WITHIN THE STATE'S PURVIEW TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF CARE IT'S RECEIVED IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BUT IT MEANS WE HAVE TO HOLD THESE FACILITIES ACCOUNTABLE AT THE LARGE CORPORATE OFFICE LEVEL. I DON'T WANNA SEE IS GOING IN AND BERATING A CNA I WANT TO SEE IS GOING INTO CORPORATE OFFICES AND TAKING AWAY THEIR JET AIRPLANES BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE TAXPAYERS MONEY IS GOING. THERE ARE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT ARE CRYING POOR EVERY DAY AND YET THEY ARE PROVIDING GREATER DIVIDENDS TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS IN A PANDEMIC THEN THEY WERE PROVIDED LAST YEAR. BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING MORE MONEY FOR THAT CARE AND THEY NEED TO BE PROVIDING. HEY TO STAFF. BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING THAT EXTRA MONEY I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT IN A WITH- HOPEFULLY WE CAN CREATE SOME TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WITH THIS AND THAT. MAYBE WE CAN PENALIZE THESE- LARGER CORPORATIONS THAT AREN'T BEING GOOD PLAYERS AND HAVE THAT MONEY GO TO- GIVE A BOOST TO THE GOOD ACTORS. ANYWAY THANK YOU. WE ARE FIRST GOING TO GO TO CHAIR WOULD PROFILER QUESTION AND THEN SHARE REYES TOOK AWAY LISA PLEASE. THANK THANK YOU AND I APOLOGIZE I HAD TO STEP OUT SO I MISSED YOUR PRESENTATION BUT I DID WANT TO- AND I APOLOGIZE EVERYBODY FOR THAT- SO MY UNDERSTANDING FRUIT FROM DOCTOR REGULARS THAT. CURRENTLY LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN REALLY ONLY ABLE TO ACCESS RESIDENTS BY TELEPHONE IS THAT. CORRECT YES AND NO OKAY. YEAH DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH CCL AND THE STATE OMBUDSMAN HAVE COME UP WITH GUIDELINES FOR OMBUDSMAN'S TO INTER FACILITIES. SAFELY A VERY SLOW. AND YET WE'RE BEING- THE ACCESS TO THESE FACILITIES IS BEING HAMPERED BY IN CONFLICT BY INCONSISTENCIESWITH LOCAL PUBLIC HOUSE SO THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SAYS NO THE OMBUDSMAN CAN'T GO IN IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT THE STATE OMBUDSMAN HAS HAS. ESTABLISHED ALL THESE PROTOCOLS BECAUSE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH TRACKS EVERYTHING. THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S TROUBLING OKAY I UNDERSTAND THAT- AND I WOULD JUST I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY YES I HAVE A I HAVE A RELATIVE IN A IN AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY. I WILL TELL YOU FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH THAT RELATIVE WHICH I SPOKE TO A LOT. LEADING UP TO- THEIR CHANGE OF RESIDENCE- THE TELEPHONE BUSINESS JUST DON'T CUT IT- QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING TO STOP THERE'S NO SUBSTITUTE FOR A FACE TO FACE- IN PERSON CONTACT AND I DON'T MEAN THROUGH A GLASS EITHER. THEIR SUBTLE BODY LANGUAGE CHANGES ARE ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN BECAUSE YOU KNOW I WENT FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOT REALIZING THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION THAT MY RELATIVE WAS IN. BECAUSE THEY HAD CREATED COPING MECHANISMS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT MAKE ME FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING WAS OKAY WHEN IT TRULY WASN'T AND SO I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO LEARN THEIR FAMILY. AND MAYBE SOME AND MAYBE NOT BE ABLE TO SPEAK UP BUT I DO WORRY THAT THIS YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE BIGGER PROBLEMS THERE THAT WE DON'T KNOW BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND OR IN BOOTS IN THE BUILDING SO TO SPEAK. AND IT REALLY REALLY IS TROUBLING SO I GUESS I AM I AM YOU KNOW I I'M DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE WE TALKED WE TALKED ABOUT THIS ISSUE. IT WE HAD A AND R. I THINK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS AT OUR LAST- OVERSIGHT HEARING WE DID ON SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WHICH WAS. BACK IN JUNE I BELIEVE- AND- AND HERE WE ARE COUPLE MONTHS LATER AND YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT PROGRESS IS SLOW AND THAT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING IN MY HOME COUNTY. EIGHTY PERCENT. ARE IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. AND I THINK THAT'S INCREDIBLY TROUBLING TO ME. AND I JUST. EIGHTY YOU GUYS DO SUCH AMAZING WORK AND IT'S I JUST. I'M REALLY REALLY FRUSTRATED THAT WEEK AS A AT THE STATE LEVEL CANNOT DO SOMETHING. TO COMPEL LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES TO ALLOW. FOR YOUR PRESENCE IN THESE FACILITIES PERIOD AND SO. THAT I DO THINK WE'RE GETTING THERE AND AS LATE. EARLIER THAT TO ADD. THE DEPARTMENT IS- SEEMINGLY MUCH MORE WILLING TO BE PROACTIVE AND SPEAK ON OUR BEHALF LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH- OF BUT- THIS IS THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND I WOULD BE SHIRKING MY RESPONSIBILITIES IF I DIDN'T POINT OUT THE FACT THAT SIXTY PERCENT. OF OMBUDSMEN CURRENTLY ARE OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY. SO WHILE THE MONEY THAT THIS THIS COMMITTEE. USED TO RESOURCE THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS STARTED TO SHOW BENEFITS WE WERE UP HUNDRED VOLUNTEERS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR- I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE DECERTIFICATION PROCESS IS HAPPENING IT'S SLOW BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT GOING TO FACILITIES IN A IN. A LARGE WAY BUT IT IS GOING TO OCCUR AND IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE THAT THE STATE SPEND MONEY TO HAVE STAFF BECAUSE WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE GOING INTO THESE FACILITIES AND IF. WE HAVE ONE PARTICULAR PROGRAM THE AVERAGE AGE OF STAFF IN THE FIFTH AT THE AVERAGE AGE FOR THAT STAFF FOR A PROGRAM. SAYING THIS BADLY. UP THERE EIGHTY YEARS OLD. WE HAVE IT WE HAVE AN OMBUDSMAN HE'S EIGHTY FOUR WITH ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY SEVENTY NINE YOU KNOW IT IT IT'SDONE THAT DOESN'T WORK THEY ARE GREAT ADVOCATES THEY ARE FEARS THEY KNOW THE RULES THEY THEY NEED NO AND HAVE FORGOTTEN MORE THAN I WILL EVER KNOW. BUT IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO BRING THEM INTO A FACILITY SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HIRE STAFF. AND THE GOOD THING IS THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM IS VERY NIMBLE AND- WHENEVER YOU HAVE GIVEN THE STAFF GIVEN A RESOURCES IN THE PAST. WITHIN A YEAR THEY'RE UP AND RUNNING AND- SO I HAVE EVERY BELIEVE THAT THAT WILL HAPPEN AGAIN THIS TIME. AND LET OMBUDSMAN'S WILL HELP MAKE A DIFFERENCE IS. WE DO HAVE TO GET THE EYES AND EARS BACK IN THESE FACILITIES. WELL THIS COMMITTEE IS DRUG DONE EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO MAKE SURE YOU GUYS WERE FULLY FUNDED AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT YOU GET THE RESOURCES YOU NEED. FOR THE CRITICAL SERVICES YOU PROVIDE SO THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. CARESS LISA I'D I WANT I WANT TO THANK YOU JUST THE IDEA OF THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM- DOES BRING SOME RELIEF TO ALL OF US BECAUSE I THINK IT'S CLEAR WE NEED TO HAVE YOU THERE WE NEED TO HAVE THE OMBUDSMAN THERE- BUT WE ALSO WANT YOU SAFE SO WHEN. ANY OF YOUR MEMBERS ARE AT RISK WE DON'T WANT THEM- TO BE EXPOSED- SO THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS ADVOCATING I SINCERELY APPRECIATE TO EARLIER I. AM SURE THAT MY UNCLE HAD- PASSED FROM COATED IN HIS FACILITY 50% OF THE RESIDENTS TESTED POSITIVE. THERE WERE A NUMBER OF DEATHS NOT JUST MY UNCLE. AND BUT I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THAT UNTIL THAT TIME. MY UNCLE WAS SO WELL TAKEN CARE OF WE VISITED IT REGULARLY AND WE FELT THAT THEY THEY THEY CARED FOR HIM THEY TOOK CARE OF HIM HE WAS ALWAYS A HAPPY GUY SO EVERYBODY WANTED TO BE AROUND HIM HE GOT A COUPLE OF GIRLFRIENDS IN THERE I DON'T KNOW- BUT JUST. IT SO THE FACILITY ITSELF I WANT TO GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE THEY DID A GREAT JOB IN TAKING CARE OF MY UNCLE BUT ONCE KOBE HAD ENTERED THE FACILITY. THAT WAS THE END- BUT WE HAD LOTS OF THE STAFF MEMBERS ALSO TESTED POSITIVE NOT 50% BUT A GOOD NUMBER OF THEM TESTED POSITIVE FINDING WAYS TO. PROTECT EVERYBODY AND THERE'S GOING TO BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. HERE I DO HAVE A QUESTION AFTER ALL OF THAT I JUST I WANTED TO THANK YOU. WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS- AND MANY OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS USE FLEXIBILITY IS WITHIN OUR CURRENT SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE TO ADDRESS CURRENT ISSUES. CAN YOU ELABORATE OR OF ANY OF THE OTHERS WOULD LIKE TO ELABORATE ON ANY PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU SEE A NEED TO PRIORITIZE. IN ORDER TO ENSURE UNINTERRUPTED CARE FOR SENIORS AND THOSE IN THE LIVING- AND THOSE LIVING WITH WITH DISABILITIES. IF AND WHEN OUR STATUS IT WITH THE SECOND WAVE OF COVERT. WELL I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE AND HOW THE LONG TERM EFFECTS ARE GOING TO BE YOU KNOW LAST YEAR THERE WERE PEOPLE THAT FELL AND WENT INTO A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AND GOT GREAT CARE THANK THEY WERE REHABILITATED ON HOW TO WALK AGAIN WITH THAT NEW HIP AND THEY'RE GONNA GET TEN TO FIFTEEN GOOD YEARS FROM THAT REHABILITATION AND I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THOSE SAME SENIORS THAT ARE FALLING AND HAVING YOUR HIPS REPLACED IN A HOSPITAL ARE NOW SO FEARFUL OF GETTING CODED THAT THEY'RE GOING HOME AND THEY'RE BY PASSING ALL OF THAT GREAT REHABILITATION. AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET TEN TO FIFTEEN GOOD YEARS ON THAT HIT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T GET THE BENEFIT THEY DIDN'T GET THE REHAB AT THE BEGINNING SO WE DO HAVE TO MAKE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY SAFE AGAIN I THINK TESTING TESTING TESTING PP PP PP I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE WASHING STATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING AND WE HAVE BRUNO'S STANDING OVER THEM MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY ACTUALLY WASHES THEIR HANDS FOR THE FULL HAPPY BIRTHDAY TWO TIMES. IF THEY- WE HAVE TO. WE HAVE TO DO FIT TESTING WE HAVE TO PROVIDE CARE INSTRUCTION IN NATIVE LANGUAGE SO THE CARE GIVERS NOTE TO THEIR CORE WHY THEY SHOULD BE WEARING THESE MASKS TOO OFTEN WE'RE HEARING REPORTS OF CARE GIVERS THAT WHERE THE MASS WHILE THE PROVIDING DIRECT CARE TO THE RESIDENTS BUT THEN THEY GO BACK TO THEIR BREAK ROOMS AND THEY'RE NOT WEARING THE MASKS ANYMORE. THAT THAT'S HOW WE GET THE SPREAD THAT'S HOW WE GET THE- NON SYMPTOMATIC PEOPLE THAT ARE PASSING THIS DISEASE. SO I WOULD SAY- WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO INCREASE THE USE OF PP TO TAKE IT OUT OF THE POLITICAL REALM AND JUST MAKE IT A PUBLIC SAFETY. AND HAND WASHING. THE ANTIBACTERIAL GOO IS GREAT BUT IT DOES NOT BE A GOOD TWENTY SECONDS OF HAND WASHING. AND MARK MY LAST QUESTION IS. HOW DO YOU OR HOW DID IT HAPPEN HOW DO WE PLAN TO USE THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL HAVE ACCESS TO NECESSARY HEALTH SERVICES DURING THE PANDEMIC. SOMEBODY ELSE WHO CAN ANSWER THAT BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A GOOD ANSWER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER REGISTERED CLEAR RAMSEY- AND JUSTICE IN AGING. YEAH I DON'T HAVE A PERFECT ANSWER THAT QUESTION I THINK IT'S A VERY. COMPLEX ANSWER GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW OUR SYSTEM IS BUILT VERY HEAVILY ON USING META CAL DOLLARS FOR- COMMUNITY SERVICES AND ON- INSTITUTIONAL LONG TERM CARE. BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS FOR EXAMPLE BE- COMMUNITY LIVING FIND COULD BE USED UP TO NON MEDICARE HOW RECIPIENTS- WE COULD LOOK AT WAYS THAT- MEDICARE COULD HELP PEOPLE RAPID. RESPONSE INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT- AND WE ALSO HAVE. WAYS TO HELP PEOPLE BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE HEALTH FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED THE SELF. IMPOVERISHMENT PROVISIONS WHICH ALLOW. OR WHEN. WOULD NEED LEVEL OF AT A NURSING HOME BUT THEY COULD BE FIXED SERVICES IN THEIR HOME THEY CAN QUALIFY FOR MEDI CAL WITHOUT HAVING TO SPEND DOWN TO A LEVEL THAT MEDIC CAL NORMALLY REQUIRES. I THINK WE HAVE TO CURRENT. ABILITY TO HELP PEOPLE BUT I THINK YOU'VE HIT UPON A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM WHICH IS. THAT WE DEPEND SO HEAVILY ON MEDICARE OUT FOR HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES PROGRAM. I DO ALSO THINK SO- WE COULD HELP BY EXPANDING OUR MEDIC HEALTH PROGRAMS. SO THAT WE'RE TAKING BURDEN OFF OF IF SOMEONE CAN GET ON TO MEDICARE THAN THEY CAN BE SERVED. ON THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE ON WAITING LISTS WHO WOULD QUALIFY BUT DON'T THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THE SERVICES THEY NEED TO DON'T APPLY. AND THEN HOPEFULLY YOU KNOW ALLOW SOME- ABILITY FOR OUR PRIVATE CARE GIVERS TO HAVE A SMALLER GROUP OF PEOPLE TO TAKE CARE BECAUSE. MEDIC HELP TAKING CARE OF THE LARGER GROUP AND AS- MEMBER CRIED TO ANSWER YOUR LAST WEEK I KNOW IS. AT WITH BUT- I'LL JUST SAY THAT I REALLY HOPE- BECAUSE SHE'D RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY CRAIG AND LISA I TOOK ONE SIDE OF THE COIN. BECAUSE WE DO NEED SAFETY IN NURSING HOMES ABSOLUTELY THERE ARE PEOPLE. WHO NEED TO THE NURSING HOME BUT IT'S THE BEST PLACEMENT FOR THEM. RIGHT NOW AND- THERE'S NO POINT IN CALLING THEM OUT AND MAKING THEM ON STAGE IN THE COMMUNITY HOWEVER. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO COULD BE WELL SERVED IN THE COMMUNITY AND SO WE SEE THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE PUT FORWARD AT THE L. TRYPTOPHAN COMMITTEE THAT OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN. SO THERE'S A PLACE. FOR PEOPLE TO GO GO TO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MACINNES CONCERNING- IF PUBLIC HEALTH THOUGHT. THIS PLACE IS NOT DOING A GOOD JOB WE THINK OUR SOLUTION COULD BE TARGETED TO THE LEVEL OF FACILITY THEN YOU COULD SAY. WE'RE TARGETING CAPABILITIES THE HIGHEST RATES. AND WORKING TO GET THE TRUTH OUT MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE WHO DO REMAIN. UNDER CONSTRUCTION CONTROL THAT WE HAVE THE STATE'S- WE CAN DIFFERENT PEOPLE. AND SO WE REALLY WANT TO SEE THE WORKING TOGETHER TO IMPROVING. OUR SYSTEM FOR OLDER ADULTS. ALL BOTH. IN THE- AND HOME SERVER. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND MISTER CHAIR MATT TAKE A PERSONAL POINT OF PRIVILEGE- JUST TO I DO WANT TO THANK ALL THOSE NURSES WHO TOOK CARE OF MY UNCLE- AFTER HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH COPD AND AS HIS CONDITION WORSENED- THREE DAYS BEFORE HIS DEATH WAS HIS BIRTHDAY. AND IT AND IT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE PROCESS THEY WOULD PUT THE EITHER AN IPAD OR AN IPHONE SO THAT WE COULD SEE HIM HE COULD SEE US- AND WE WERE ABLE TO SING HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO HIM WITH MONEY THAT SHE- AND THREE DAYS LATER HE DID PASS BUT- THE NURSING. PEOPLE ARE SO IMPORTANT AT ALL OF THIS AND I THINK. THAT'S WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT AS WE- LOOK TO ANY PROGRAM TO ANY CHANGES WE HAVE TO BE SURE TO TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKINGCARE OF THE PATIENTS AND GOES TO LEASE THOSE- COMMENT ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT. IT ISN'T TO THE JETS THAT ARE BEING- FUNDED BUT IT'S THE PEOPLE TAKING CARE OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE OUR MOST PRECIOUS- PEOPLE THAT THOSE ARE THE ONES WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF HIM SO YOU THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE PROCESS I WILL. ALWAYS BE THE ADVOCATE FOR THE WORKERS ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES PUTTING THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE. TO TAKE CARE OF OUR ELDERLY ARE DISABLED AND WE'VE GOT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT THEM SO THAT THEY CAN BE HEALTHY. AND BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF THE VERY PEOPLE THERE TAKING CARE OF SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR RAILS FOR BRINGING THE HUMAN INTO HUMAN SERVICES YOU ALWAYS REMIND US IT'S ABOUT THE PERSON AND- NOT THE STATISTICS AND APPRECIATE THAT TRINITARIAN. IF YOU HAD A QUESTION I WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE TIME IF NOT. PERFECT THEN I WILL ASK THE FINAL TWO QUESTIONS ON THIS PANEL I I MAY- FIRST TO YOU MISS COLEMAN. ERECTOR LIGHT BORN EARLIER SAID THAT THERE WAS A MISSING LINK IN THE CONTINUUM OF ARE. AND WANTED TO GET YOUR ASSESSMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S TRUE. ABSOLUTELY THAT IS TRUE EIGHT OUT WE. WE HAVE VERY BLANKET YOU EITHER FIT INTO THIS COLUMN BECAUSE YOU HAVE FUNDS OR YOU DON'T HAVE FUNDS AND SO YOU'RE RELEGATED INTO THIS ARENA WE ARE TRYING TO COMBINE TO WHAT I THINK OF IS TWO VERY DIFFERENT GROUPS WE HAVE OLDER ADULTS WHO ARE DEAF WHO HAVE DISABILITIES. AND THEN WE HAVE OLDER ADULTS WHO HAVE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND THOSE TWO GROUPS SHOULD NOT BE TREATED THE SAME WELL THE PERSON THAT HAS A SHARP MIND BUT HAS MEDICAL CONDITIONS MIGHT BE VERY WELL SUITED IN HOME UTILIZING CARE GIVERS BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE SUCCESSFULLY THEIR CARE NEEDS BEING ABLE TO ANTICIPATE WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO NEED CARE. AT AN OLDER ADULT WITH A COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT THAT JUST DOESN'T WORK YOU CAN'T TAKE A PERSON WITH ADVANCED DEMENTIA AND SAY WELL I'M GOING TO PROVIDE THEM WITH CARE AT BREAKFAST AND SHOWERS AND THEN SOMEONE ELSE WILL STOP IRAN LUNCH AND THEN SOMEONE ELSE TO COME AND PUT HIM TO BED AT NIGHT. THAT WOULD BE LIKE THE SAME AS SAYING WANT GET- SIX HOURS A DAY SPREAD OUT OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY FOR MY SIX YEAR OLD TO GET STATE KERR IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE AND WE'RE TRYING TO. USE THESE PROGRAMS FOR TWO VERY DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT POPULATIONS. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY FAMILIES THAT ARE STRUGGLING DOING THE VERY BEST THEY CAN TO KEEP MOM AND DAD AT HOME SAFE. I ALSO KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF OLDER ADULTS THAT ARE EXPERIENCING SUCH SEVERE SOCIAL ISOLATION. BECAUSE WE'RE KEEPING THEM AT HOME ALONE. INSTEAD OF ALLOWING THEM TO LIVE IN A COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT I CAN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY WHERE THEY STILL HAVE THEIR OWN APARTMENT THEY STILL HAVE THEIR OWN BATHROOM THEY HAVE THEIR OWN PERSONAL SPACE. BUT THEY ALSO GET TO BENEFIT FROM HAVING A COMMUNITY TO BE AROUND THEM. SO YES I DO THINK THE- DIRECTOR HAS HIT UPON EIGHT EIGHT EIGHT DISTINCT PROBLEM IN THE SYSTEM. WE ARE TRYING TO COVER TOO WIDE. A POPULATION WITH TOO NARROW A FRESH. I WILL APPRECIATE THAT MISS COLEMAN WE'VE ALWAYS LOOKED TO YOU TO BE OUR EYES AND EARS WITHIN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND THAT THAT- UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE SYSTEMS WORK IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR US AS LEGISLATORS AND- BELIEVE IT ALLOWS US TO. SEE THAT THERE IS A NEED TO WORK ON THIS PROBLEM. BUT WE HAVE TO GET IT RIGHT. AND SO WITH THAT IF I COULD THE FINAL QUESTION FOR THIS PANEL IS FOR MISS RAMSEY. AND YOU KNOW I WAS QUITE APPRECIATIVE OF THE SUB COMMITTEE COMING UP WITH TWELVE RECOMMENDATIONS. BUT I WANTED TO SEE IF. AND YOU WERE VERY EXPLICIT NOT TO SAY THAT THEY WERE PRIORITIZED IN. ANY WAY. AND IRONICALLY I'M ASKING FOR YOU NOW TO PRIORITIZE THEM. AND SEE IF ANY ARE ESPECIALLY CRUCIAL FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO ACT UPON NOW- I WOULD HIGHLIGHT AND STAND UP- RECOMMENDATIONS ONE M. ELEVEN THAT. JUMPED OUT TO ME BUT WANTED TO SEE IF ANY OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS MISS RAMSEY- OR ESPECIALLY CRUCIAL RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER- ARAMBULA I. I THINK. OKAY TWO THINGS ONE IS I WILL SAY THAT FOR THE L. TRYPTOPHAN COMMITTEE DOT GROUP HAS NOT PUT A PRIORITIZATION UPON THE BOOK SO I DO WANT TO SAY THAT RIGHT NOW I'M JUST SPEAKING FOR MYSELF AND THAT DIFFERENT MEMBERS OF THAT SUBCOMMITTEE COULD. HAVE DIFFERENT CENTER PRIVATIZATION I WOULD SAY WERE I SEE THAT THE NEED IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS. STOCK ACTION TAKEN EACH OF THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES SO ARE YOU GREEN THAT NUMBER ONE AROUND THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY TRANSITION. IS REALLY VITAL TO MAKING SURE THAT WE BASICALLY CAN EXPAND A PROGRAM THAT ALREADY WORK. AND JUST APPLY IT TO A LARGER POPULATION AND ONE THAT WE KNOW MAKES UP THE VAST MAJORITY OF BURDENS AND EVERYTHING HOMES. I THINK WE DO NEED TO FIND A WAY TO DO SOME INCREASING OF CAPACITY WITHIN OUR CURRENT H. CBS PROGRAM- I THINK I JUST GOT TWENTY HOURS- VERY DOABLE QUICKLY BECAUSE THAT ALREADY EXISTS AND IT DOESN'T REQUIRE. A LOT OF ADDITIONAL. CLICK OR A LOT OF CHANGES BUT I SAY THAT I. THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL. AS WELL- IF YOU CAN- PUT MONEY INTO THE INTO THE PROGRAM AND THEN LASTLY I AGREE WITH YOU ABOUT NUMBER ELEVEN BECAUSE IT DOES SEEM. TO BE FAIRLY OUT OF CONTROL THAT WE MIGHT LET PEOPLE WHO ARE POSITIVE FOR KOBE D. GOING INTO NURSING HOMES TO GOING BACK INTO THEIR OWN HOME AND INTO THE COMMUNITY AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT. SO I THINK THERE IS. A REAL NEED IMMEDIATELY FOR TESTING BUT I WILL SAY THAT NUMBER TWELVE YOU KNOW WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO TAKE RISKS AND ALL THE FOCUS ON WORKERS I THINK IT'S BEEN. VERY IMPORTANT AND THAT TO ME IS- UNDERLINED BY RECOMMENDATION TWELVE WHICH IS REALLY SAYING WE'RE NOT GONNA LET OUR HOME CARE WORKERS ARE. NURSING HOME WORKERS ARE COMMUNICATE WORKERS. DO THE JOB WITHOUT PROPER PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT SO- THAT WOULD BE FOR MY PARTICIPATION BUT I KNOW THERE MIGHT BE OTHERS WHO WOULD- WHO MIGHT. EVEN DIFFERENT WAY. NO THAT'S INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AND I AGREE WITH THE APPROACH OF LOOKING WITHIN THE THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES THAT YOU HAVE- JUST TO REPEAT IT APPEARS YOU'VE SAID NUMBER ONE. AND AS I'M TRACKING IT FOUR FIVE AND SIX AS WELL AS NORMAL ELEVEN AND TWELVE- WHICH- A- JUST WANTS TO APPRECIATE EVEN JUST OPINING ABOUT THAT IN REAL TIME IT HELPS US TO- KNOW WHICH ONES ARE ESPECIALLY CRUCIAL. WITH THAT I WANTED TO THANK THIS PANEL AND MOVE ON TO OUR FINAL PANEL THE ADMINISTRATION REACTION PANEL WHERE WE WILL HAVE DIRECTOR LIGHT BORN DIRECTOR LEAD AS WELL AS- DEPUTY DIRECTOR STEIN OCCUR AS WELL AS JACOB LAMB FROM DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT WE MAY HAVE. SO IF WE CAN INVITE THAT PANEL BACK AND SE WHAT REACTION THEY HAVE STARTING WITH DIRECTOR LEVEL. THANK THANK YOU. IN TERMS OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT- THE LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS UP COMMITTEE ARM DEVELOPED- FIRSTLY JUST SAVE OUR STUFF INSTEAD OF GOING THROUGH IN. IN DETAIL TO TRY TO. BE SURE THAT IN A COUPLE ALL FOUR CORNERS UNDERSTOOD. SEVERAL OF THE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS OWN REQUIRE NON EMERGENCY FEDERAL WAIVERS WHICH ARE LONG. LONG IN GETTING IT WILL COME QUICKLY. SO IT DOES PROBABLY YOU KNOW WE WILL HAVE TO. PUT TO ONE SIDE OTHERS ON. CANDIDLY FRANKLY MAYBE BUDGET ISSUES ON THAT IF THEY IF THEY'RE NOT HELP BUDGET ON THESE MAY BE THINGS THAT- SHOULD SHOULD E DOUBLE IF THEY'RE ALL THESE. THE ADMINISTRATION AS I SAID EARLIER WHICH WILL REDUCE OF EMBARKING ON OR IN THE- THIS GOT TO EVERYONE ON THE IMMEDIATE ACTION STEPS FOR DOING THOSE OF COURSE WERE COMMITTED TO NOW- WE'LL BE WORKING WITH. STAKEHOLDERS AND PARTNERS. OTHERS ARE OR WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH OTHERS ALL. TO THE QUESTION OF. WITH IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES MAKE SURE THAT ALL EMPLOYEES I'M- THE- THEIR THEIR THEIR NEEDS ARE BEING MET- YOU WILL RECALL THAT THE STATE BUDGET OKAY ALLOWED US TO GIVE A 10% RATE INCREASE UP TO SKILLED NURSING ASSOCIATED WITH OF THE PANDEMIC. WE WILL BE ON THE BACK END OF IT ALL GOING BACK TO WHAT IT CALLED THE NURSING HOMES TO BE SURE THAT THOSE FUNDS ACTUALLY MADE IT TO SUPPORTING THEIR WORK FORCES NOT TO. JETS THE WHATEVER ELSE ON THE PROFIT LINE. MIGHT'VE BEEN ALMOST B. SORT OF BROADLY THE RIGHT I HOPE THAT OUR ALONG EARLIER PRESENTATION SORT OF TO THE EXTENT THAT THE GOAL IS TO CONTINUE ON THE MOST WIDESPREAD POSSIBLE DIALOGUE ON BOTH AROUND SUGGESTIONS FOR SHORT TERM BUT ALSO THE NEED TO. INCORPORATE STRATEGIES INTO SORT OF A MORE LASTING. PROGRAM CONSTRUCTION WILL CONTINUE AND BY SINCERE APOLOGIES TO THE LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN GROUP WE HAD ADDED THEM STAKEHOLDERS I SOMEHOW THOUGHT THEY WERE ON THE LTSS. LONG GROUP BUT WE WILL COURSE BE REACHING OUT TO THEM WITH THAT ON MAY BE TURNED OVER TO A DIRECTOR WAY. THANK YOU SHARE ARAMBULA I WOULD SAY. COUPLE REFLECTIONS ON AFTER THIS REALLY- IMPORTANT INFORMATIVE DISCUSSION TODAY- CLEARLY WE'RE AT ALL HANDS ON DECK- MOMENT IN A MOMENT IT'S GOING TO BE WITH US FOR QUITE SOME TIME SO- THE PARTNERSHIP OF THE LEGISLATURE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER- AND I THINK I WANT TO APPRECIATE PEOPLE'S OF KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT IT HAS BEEN AN OVERWHELMING TIME IT'S BEEN A FAST MOVING TIME IT IS BEEN A STRESSFUL TIME PERSONALLY PROFESSIONALLY FOR SO MANY OF WILL DO BETTER. I WANT TO THANK LEGISLATIVE STAFFERS CONTINUE TO REACH OUT AND WORK THROUGH THESE VERY DIFFICULT ISSUES AT ALL KINDS OF OURS AND ALL KINDS OF A CONVERSATION SO THAT WE ARE WORKING WALKING FORWARD HAND IN HAND WE DO NEED ALL OF OUR HEARTS AND MINDS- WORKING ON THESE ISSUES. SO JUST LOOKED UP A COUPLE THAT ARE TOP OF MIND DEPARTMENT OF AGING. TO GO BACK TO DIRECTOR LIFE FORMS WERE WE ARE BOTH- DOING THAT EMERGENCY CRISIS IMMEDIATE RESPONSE DAY IN DAY OUT AND- MOVING US TO THE TRANSFORMATIVE FUTURE THAT IS CLEARLY REQUIRED. BY THE CHALLENGES WE'RE FACING IN THIS RESPONSE. SO TOP OF MIND FOR US THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING IS AS LISA SAID. RE ENTRY INTO THE SKILLED NURSING AND ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES WE DO AGREE WE NEED OUR EYES AND EARS ON FOLKS. WE ARE TRYING TO WORK WITH THE ON WHAT'S TO HELP THEM WITH THE BARRIERS ARE. A STATE OR LOCAL OR TRAINING OR PP OR TESTING WE'VE GOT SOME OF THOSE BARRIERS AND HAVE INITIATIVES UNDER WAY BOTH CENTRAL VALLEY IN LA TO KNOCK THOSE BARRIERS DOWN. WE ALSO WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE USING EVERY SINGLE INCH OF OUR CAPACITY IN THE M. S. S. P. SYSTEM THE CBS SYSTEM. AND THE TRIPLE A SYSTEM WHICH DID RECEIVE CARE RESPONDING THAT WENT OUT THE LAST WEEK OF JULY. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERY COMMUNITY HAS THAT AND SPENDING THAT ON THE HOME AND COMMUNITY SERVICES THE FAMILY CAREGIVER SUPPORT. THE HOME ALL PART OF THAT WRAP SERVICES. BUT WE DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS MOMENT. TO TRANSFORM WE CANNOT JUST CONTINUE TO ASK OUR PATCHWORK QUILT. TO COVER US ALL I DO SO AN EQUITABLE AND EFFECTIVE WAY WE REALLY DO NEED TO REIMAGINE THE FUTURE AND I WANT TO THANK CRAIG CORNET AND OTHERS WHO HAVE. IN OUR FIRST ABLE TO CONVERSATION ABOUT SKILLED NURSING- SO WE DO NEED TO CREATE SPACE TO REIMAGINE% SKILLED NURSING FOR THE FUTURE. WE DO NEED TO REIMAGINE WHAT ARE HEALTH CARE THE SECOND HALF OF OUR LIFE LOOKS LIKE- AND THAT'S WHY THE MASTER PLAN AND OTHER STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT LEGISLATIVE ENGAGEMENT IN LONG TERM CARE AT HOME IS SO IMPORTANT. OUT OF THIS TRAUMA NEEDS TO COME TRANSFORMATION. AND ONE PIECE THAT YOU- AS IN GOVERNMENT WILL KNOW. IS THE NEED FOR HUBS. WHERE IS THAT ONE STOP THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLING YOUR OFFICE IS PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLING OUR OFFICES I THINK ALL OF OUR PHONES ARE RINGING OFF THE HOOK WITH PEOPLE. NEEDING INFORMATION. I IN GREAT. AS THEY TRY TO OUT THE BEST THINGS FOR THEM. AND THEIR FAMILIES SO WE KNOW THE TIME IS. IS UPON US TO GET OUR AGING AND DISABILITY SYSTEMS INTO HUBS. GET OUR LTSS SYSTEMS INTO HOMES IS DH CS IS. IS PROPOSING WE HAVE SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF THIS AROUND THE STATE IN AROUND PROVIDER NETWORKS BUT WE DON'T YET HAVE. THE SYSTEM THAT WE ALL WANT FOR OURSELVES AND FOR OUR LOVED ONES- AND SO AGAIN- MOVING FORWARD ON BOTH FRONTS. URGENTLY AND IN PARTNERSHIP- WE WILL BE A DIFFERENT PLACE WE HAVE TO BE THANK YOU. THANK YOU DIRECTOR WADE WANTED TO SEE IF DEPUTY DIRECTOR STEINORTH HER HEAD IN THE- FINAL. WELL GOOD MORNING AGAIN OR ACTUALLY I GUESS WE SHOULD NOW SAY GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING THIS FORUM TODAY- THANK YOU BOTH THE LEGISLATORS AND OUR PARTNERS- ARE STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE BEEN ENGAGED- YOU KNOW. CRAIG KARNAD AND LISA COLEMAN WHO I'VE WORKED WITH- QUITE EXTENSIVELY THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC IN PRIOR. THIS REALLY IS ABOUT THE COLLABORATION- BOTH- I ECHO SOME OF THE- COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE EARLIER ABOUT- SOMETIMES THOSE FRUSTRATIONS RIGHT BETWEEN THE FEDERAL THE STATE AND THE COUNTY- LEVEL ISSUING GUIDANCE ARE ALL HAVING DIFFERENT LEVELS OF AUTHORITY. ON THESE FACILITIES- THAT ARE IMPACTED. YEAH I ACTUALLY I HAD THE PLEASURE OF A FLYING DOWN TO IMPERIAL I'VE SPENT THE LAST TWO WEEKS ON THE ROAD IN SIX DIFFERENT COUNTIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND I'LL BE IN KINGS COUNTY LATER THIS WEEK- BECAUSE THERE IS THAT THAT NEEDED THAT COLLABORATION FACE TO FACE- BOTH WALKING THROUGH THOSE FACILITIES THAT ARE HARDEST HIT. AS WELL AS WORKING WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS- I FOUND OFF IN ONE OF THOSE STRATEGIES- THAT THAT IT'S BEEN HELPFUL- IN THAT KIND OF LEAVING OUT SOME OF THESE ISSUES AROUND I THINK THAT. THAT REPRESENTATIVE MATHIS WHO POINTED OUT AS WELL AS SOME OF OTHERS ABOUT THAT FRUSTRATION BETWEEN YOU KNOW WHERE IS THE COUNTY AUTHORITY THE STATE AUTHORITY AND THAT THE FEDERAL CMS WHO ACTUALLY- CERTIFIES THESE FACILITIES THERE ARE FORTY. AND SOMETIMES THAT HAS TO BE A CONVERSATION TOGETHER WITH THOSE FACILITIES- TEATHER LEVEL SET OR MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THAT. THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL A FEW THINGS THAT I WON TO TOUCH ON. AS I WAS I. THERE'S A FEW QUESTIONS PRIOR. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE SOME LESSONS LEARNED- WHAT HAVE WE CHANGE NOW WOULD HAVE BEEN SIX OF SOME STRATEGIES THAT SEEM TO WORK. AND WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATUS. OF ONE OF THE QUICK THINGS THAT WE FOUND OUT EARLY ON THE PANDEMIC IS THAT A FACILITY CAN CHANGE. DRASTICALLY WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS. THANK MAGNOLIA- IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT THAT HAPPENED IN APRIL WHERE ARE STATE STAFF IN THERE TWO DAYS PRIOR TO THE EVACUATION. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT. YOU CAN HAVE ALL OF THE GREAT BEST LAID PLANS IN PLACE WITH INFECTION PREVENTION% AND EVERYTHING LOOKING COPA STATIC. BUT THE MOMENT THAT THERE IS THAT- IMPACT OF COATED WE HAVE FOUND VARIOUS DEGREES OF REACTIONS- IN A FACILITY. IN UNDERSTANDING THAT STAFFING AND PP- ARE CRITICAL AND WE DISCOVERED EARLY ON AND DID A CASE STUDY ON THIS. AND FOUND THAT YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH ALL FACILITIES HAVE EMERGENCY PLANS THEY DON'T NECESSARILY- SPECIFICALLY- TALK ABOUT CONTINGENCY PLANS WITH HOPE IT. IN SO THAT'S WHY WE WERE THE FIRST AND ONLY STATE TO REQUIRE MITIGATION PLANS OF ALL OF OUR FACILITIES. AND AS CRAIG HAD MENTIONED WE'RE NOW ON SITE MORE THAN EVER IN FACT I THINK I TRACKED. IN THE THREE MONTHS BETWEEN. APRIL AND- JULY WE WERE ON SITE A THOUSAND TIMES MORE THAN WE WERE IN THE PRIOR YEAR. AND THAT KIND OF CADENCE AND OVERSIGHT AND PHYSICALLY JUST BOOTS ON THE GROUND IN THE FACILITY I BELIEVE HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY. WHEN WE LOK AT KIND OF REGULATORY REFORM WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT THE CADENCE OF FREQUENCY THAT WERE IN FACILITIES. THAT'S WHY THAT'S A BIG PART OF THE PUSH FOR DPH TO CONTINUE. THAT GOING FORWARD. I THE OTHER PIECES WAS. A BIG FAN HERE IS THAT WHICH WAS MENTIONED WAS TRANSPARENCY OF INFORMATION- WE DID JUST RELEASED A NEW SNIFF WEBPAGE- WHICH I INVITE ALL OF YOU TO. TAKE A LOOK AT- THE IT'S MORE TRANSPARENT THAN EVER AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO TAKE INFORMATION AS FAR AS TESTING WHOSE TESTING- THE- THE POSITIVES NEGATIVES. REFUSALS ECCENTRIC WE HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT JUST CASE AND DEATH ANNA BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WE HAVE INFORMATION ON. WHERE ARE THE FIST- WHICH OF THE FACILITIES EACH WEEK WHO HAVE BEEN DEEMED OKAY- BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. TO HAVE INDOOR VISITATIONS OF PEOPLE LOVED ONES CAN LOOK AT THAT. AS A STATE WE DID LEAN VERY FORWARD AND WENT ON AND STATE STATED THAT ALL FACILITIES AND- CALIFORNIA MUST REQUIRE OUTDOOR VISITATION- IN THE IN ADVANCE OF WHATEVER CMS GUIDANCE HOT- AND WE ALSO HAVE INFORMATION ON THERE ABOUT WHAT WE PHYSICALLY DOING WHICH I THINK IS MOST IMPORTANT THAT. IT'S NOT JUST A FINAL LOVED WHEN I LOOK UP THERE AND I SEE OKAY THIS IS THE FACILITY AND THIS IS HOW MANY CASES AND DEATHS. MORE IMPORTANTLY WE THEN HAVE INFORMATION ON THERE AS TO- WHEN OUR INFECTION CONTROL STRIKE TEAMS HAVE BEEN WHAT'S THE LAST TIME THAT WE WENT IN THERE FOR MITIGATION PLAN SURVEY WHAT ARE WE PHYSICALLY DOING IN THOSE FACILITIES AS A STATE WHETHER THEY BE OUR SURVEYORS THERE THERE. WERE OUR STRIKE TEAMS ARE INFECTION CONTROL STRIKE TEAMS ARE THERE SO PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND THAT'S OUR EFFORT TO TRY TO HAVE THATONE STOP SHOP OF INFORMATION- FOR THE PUBLIC. THE OTHER THAT WE- REALLY LEARNED. OBVIOUSLY WAS THAT. INFECTION CONTROL IS- ONE OF THOSE- KIND OF ACHILLES HEELS GOING INTO COBIT AT SOME OF THESE FACILITIES. SO WE REALLY BOLSTERED UP THE TRAINING THE EDUCATION. I'M DOING STATEWIDE CALLS THREE TIMES A WEEK WEBINARS ON ONCE A WEEK. HAVING THE- ARE H. I. STAFF THE INCREASED OR H. I. STAFF A FIFTY PERCENT. WE RE TRAINED ALL OF OUR SURVEYORS ON H.I. COMPETENCIES. SO THAT EVERYONE. HAS THAT ABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE STAFF WHO ARE COMFORTABLE DONNING AND DOFFING CORRECTLY. MAKING SURE THAT THE CO ORDINATES OWN IT CORRECTLY. I'M AND WORKING A LOT WITH OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AS WELL- TO BEEF UP THEIR RESOURCES. AND THEN LAST BUT NOT LEAST ARE PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS WHICH I KNOW I'VE TALKED- TO ON THE LEGISLATURE OF ABOUT BEFORE. BUT WE ARE FINDING THAT THIS WAY OF LOOKING AT DATA PULLING DATA EARLY AND OFTEN COUPLING IT WITH EARLIER PASSED COMPLIANCE DATA. COUPLING IT WITH- ALL OF THE CASE RATES AND- OUTBREAKS IN A REGION WERE ABLE TO HAVE A HIGH RISK LIST IN EACH DAY ON OUR SNIFF WEBSITE WE DO POST WITH THAT HIGH RISK LIST IS. AND THEN WE ALSO DO TO KEEP THAT LIST BY SHOWING YOU THE NEXT DAY WHAT DID WE DO IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS AT THAT HIGH RISK OF TO BE VISIT ON SITE NO- WHAT DID NEED NATURE I REFERRAL ETCETERA- IN THAT HAS BEEN HELPFUL IN JUST GOING. EARLY AND INTERVENING EARLY TO HELP MITIGATE- WE HAVE FOUND THAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT HOSPITAL LAYS HOSPITALIZATIONS DID PEAK IN CALIFORNIA- IN LATE SUMMER AS WELL AS OUR CASES HAVE. BEEN RISING AND LACE UP LATE SUMMER I AM HAPPY TO REPORT THAT SOME OF THESE INTERVENTIONS THAT WE HAVE PLACED- HAS MADE IT SO THAT THE- DEATH RATE HAS DECREASED AND STABILIZED. AS WELL AS THE- CASE RATE AND ARE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES HAS- STABILIZE FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. SO MORE WORK TO DO. I BELIEVE THAT DOT TESTING AT STAFF YOU KNOW THOSE TWO THINGS THAT ARE REALLY- GONNA BE INCREMENTAL ESPECIALLY AS WE GO INTO- FLU SEASON. I CAN TELL YOU THAT'S WHAT KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT IS MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE PLANS IN PLACE TO BOLSTER- TESTING AS WELL AS- STAFFING WORK FORCE. SO THAT WE ARE PREPARED GOING INTO- A FLU SEASON. THANK YOU MISDIAGNOSIS- I WILL BRING IT BACK NOW FOR MEMBERS TO ASK QUESTIONS WE WILL START WITH CHAIR IN THIS AREA. HANK YOU. THANK YOU SURE ARAMBULA- I JUST WAS TAKEN BY THE LAST COMMENT MISTER AND MISS SENECA STACKER THAT YOU MADE ABOUT WHAT KEEPS YOU UP AT% NIGHT. I A- HONESTLY SOMETIMES FIELD WITH YOUR CALM AND MEASURED RESPONSES NOT MUCH KEEPS YOU UP AT NIGHT. WHEN I'M GONNA CONTINUE HARPING ON THIS TESTING ISSUE BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE YOU'VE GIVEN EVERY REASON YOU'RE EXTREMELY VERBOSE AND VERY TALENTED AT ARTICULATING THE VARIOUS STEPS TAKEN. BUT YOUR RESPONSE IS NOT COMMENSURATE TO THE INTENSITY AND URGENCY YOU HAVE HEARD FROM THE PANELISTS TODAY. AND IF YOU FAIL TO CONTINUE TO RESPOND WITH URGENCY THAT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO I REMEMBER ALSO SPEAKING TO MISTER CORNET ABOUT. IS ON MY WAY TO THE FUNERAL OF THE FORMER MEMBER CUT CHOI CHU HI JUNE WHEN I WAS ON THE PHONE THE ENTIRE DRIVE TALKING TO VARIOUS OPERATORS IN LOS ANGELES ABOUT. SHUTTING PUT THE POTENTIAL OF SHUTTING DOWN. SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. AND WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION AND THAT HAPPENED IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME WE THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD STEP TO DO THAT. YET WE NEVER ANTICIPATED THAT WHEN WE'RE CREATING. A SAFE BUBBLE THAT THEN WITHIN THAT BUBBLE THERE WOULD BE CONTAMINATION AND THERE WOULD BE ALL THESE CHALLENGES LEADING UP TO SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF DEATH. SO I HATE I NEED TO HAVE THAT URGENCY IN RESPONSE FROM YOU IN KNOWING ALSO WHAT'S GOING ON YOU BROUGHT UP SURVEYORS ARE THEY BEING TESTED. YES THEY ARE HOW WHAT FREQUENCY. SO WE TEST OUR OUR SURVEYORS THE SAME FREQUENCY AS WE DO FOR OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT WE REGULATE THAT'S NOT WHAT I FIGURED. THAT IS WHAT WE DO I CAN SHARE WITH YOU THE POLICY AND BE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU. IN FACT. FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN. SURVEYORS. I AFFECT BEING TOLD TO BE TESTED. ALONG WITH THE PUBLIC. SO WE DO HAVE A TESTING POLICY WE DO HAVE A CONTRACTED- TESTING- GROUP FOR OUR SURVEYORS WE ALSO AND I'M HAPPY TO SHARE ALL OF THAT WITH YOU I DO KNOW THAT YOU MUST BE REFERENCING PROBABLY THE LA TIMES ARTICLE THAT HAPPENED A FEW WEEKS AGO- BUT WE DID REQUEST FOR A TESTING POLICY THE SAME EXACT WEEK THAT WE- ISSUED OUT OUR TESTING AFL. AND WE DO HAVE BOTH FAIRLY OPTIM SERVER WE HAVE SEVERAL OPTIONS FOR TESTING FOR ALL OF OUR SURVEYORS SO- I ASSURE YOU WE SHARE WITH YOU THAT POLICY WOULD BE HAVE TO DO SO AND YET SINCE WERE ADDED WHAT ABOUT THE OMBUDSMAN ARE THEY GETTING TESTED. SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO- THAT'S BEEN THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING I'D BE HAPPY TO HAVE DIRECTOR CAN'T WAIT COME BACK UP HERE- AND I APOLOGIZE IF MY- IF MY PROFESSIONAL RESPONSES ARE MEASURED IN KONG. HOWEVER I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THERE IS DEFINITELY A SENSE OF URGENCY WHICH IS WHY MANY OF US HAS BEEN WORKING. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN FOR SEVEN MONTHS. AND YES THIS IS ALSO BOTH PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL FACT THAT AWFUL ALSO LOST A LOVED ONE. IN ONE OF OUR CONGREGATE SETTINGS IN CALIFORNIA DO TO COPE IT. SO PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT EVEN THOUGH WE AE COMMON MEASURE IN OUR RESPONSES TODAY WE ARE DEFINITELY AND PASSIONATE ABOUT WHAT WE DO. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT TODAY IT'S ABOUT AND I AM SORRY FOR YOUR- LOSS OF YOUR LOVED ONE I DON'T WANT THAT TO SLIP BY. BUT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT. YOUR RESPONSES TODAY IT'S BEEN THE SERIAL RESPONSES IT'S THE RESPONSE IS GOING BACK TO AS FAR AS EVEN. OF THE PREVIOUS HEARING AND CONVERSATIONS BEFORE THAT WHERE. YOU'VE HEARD FROM VARIOUS CHAIRS VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY ASKING FOR THERE TO BE. ACTION TAKEN FOR AND YET IT'S- IT. AGAIN YOUR RESPONSE HAS EITHER BEEN NOT COMMENSURATE TO THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FEEL WE'RE DEALING WITH NOR HAS. OF YOUR ELUSIVENESS OF NOT REALLY. COLLABORATING WITH US ALLOWED US TO HAVE BETTER CONFIDENCE IN KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON AGAIN GOING BACK TO WHAT I HAD BROUGHT UP BEFORE WITH- MR- LIKE BORN ABOUT- THE DATA. WE AYE IT'S INTERESTING FOR ME TO KNOW HOW WE'RE COMING UP WITH A WHOLE NEW PROGRAM WHEN. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE DATA IS BASED ON. AND BY THE WAY I WAS NOT HERE WHEN MR LIGHT BOARD HAD TO STEP OUT FOR A MEETING WITH MY CONSTITUENTS BUT MR LAPOINTE THIS TALKED ABOUT- MEDIC CALIFORNIANS SING AND I WAS INTERESTED TO FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT. WHETHER THERE IS ANY DUPLICATION OR OVERLAP OF MEDICARE FINANCING SO IF- MISTER LIKE PORN IS STILL THERE I WOULD APPRECIATE A FOLLOW UP DOESN'T HAVE TO BE NOW BUT A FOLLOW UP ON ON THIS TOPIC- WITH MORE DATA. BUT AS- FOR YOUR TO JUST COMPLETE MY COMMENTS UP- MISTER MAKER I WOULD TO. UP I WOULD EVEN PROPOSE RIGHT NOW FOR MY COLLEAGUES IF WE WOULD LIKE TO AT SOME POINT HAVE A HEARING. IN SEPTEMBER OCTOBER WHENEVER WE FEEL APPROPRIATE BUT BUT- AT LEAST ONE OR TWO MORE. BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR SO THAT THERE IS A CONTINUED. CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS AND FOR US TO KNOW EXACTLY WITH WHAT LEVEL OF URGENCY YOU'RE MEETING SOME OF THE DEMANDS THAT WE'VE BEEN ASKING ABOUT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. THANK YOU CHEN ARAMBULA- W. DIRECTOR- STANEK- DON'T KNOW GOING TOO FAR. I'M HERE YOU'RE YOU'RE STILL IN THE HOT SEAT. THE QUESTIONS I REALLY HAVE OR YOU KNOW BACK WHEN EVERYTHING TOOK OFF IN MARCH AND- EVEN BEFORE THEN EMAIL WE'RE WE'RE TO THE POINT WHERE TALK ABOUT STRIKE TEAMS EXPRESSLY IN THE- AGAIN IN THE SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AREA- AND I KNOW I SPECIFICALLY ASKED THAT WE KEEP- TEAMS AND BEDDED. WITH THESE COUNTY OFFICES TO ENSURE THINGS WERE WE'RE GOING ON BECAUSE I MEAN THAT THE FACT IS NOBODY'S DEALT WITH ANYTHING LIKE THIS. IN THIS LIFETIME EVER. AND SO THERE IS NO PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD HAVE PREPARED ANYBODY FOR THIS. AND IT'S NOTHING AGAINST ANYBODY BUT THE FACT IS YOU KNOW YOU COUNTY NEED ALL HANDS ON DECK AND- WHEN WE START HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS OF. WE KNOW OF I COUNTY HAS. A SEVERE NEED IN NEEDS HELP. WHAT IS GOING ON WITH CAN YOU DRIVE A LITTLE MORE DEPTH FOR THE MEMBERS ON WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOW WHEN HE SENT A STRIKE TEAM AND ARE THEY EMBEDDED WITH THE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH WHAT IS THEIR ROLE THERE WHAT ARE THEY DOING THERE- I KNOW WE ALL JUST YOU KNOW WE HEAR ON THE NEWS. THEY WERE FINALLY GETTING THIS FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO GO OUT TO THESE AREAS BUT I ALSO GET CALLS FROM CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE CONCERNED THAT YOU KNOW IT'S IS THIS MONEY GOING TO HEALTH IS A GOING TO ACCOUNTING OFFICES IS IT GOING TO GET MORE PP IS THIS NURSING AND STAFFING IN THESE THINGS. OR IS IT. A INCREASE ON SAY ABC LICENSE GUYS GOING OUT GOING AFTER SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE OPEN THE THESE ARE THE PHONE CALLS I GET. AND SINCE I HAVE YOU IN THE HOT SEAT I'D LIKE TO NOW- AND SO ON MY CONSTITUENTS. NO PRESSURE EIGHT THAT AND- I CAN UNDERSTAND- PARTICULARLY- THE AREA IN WHICH YOU REPRESENT- SINCE I'VE SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME THERE RECENTLY. AS WELL AS I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY O I UNDERSTAND- THAT THEY WERE HIT HARD VERY EARLY. AND WHEN WE DO SEND OUT A STRIKE TEAM WHAT WE OFTEN DO- IT LOOKS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON ON THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE. BUT WE DO SEND OUT STRIKE TEAMS WE DO BOTH STATE- AT THE FACILITY AND TELL THEIR STABILIZED- WE USUALLY SEE FIRSTHAND OUT OUR- OUR SURVEYORS BECAUSE THEY'RE QUICK THEY'RE FASTER THEIR THEIR- THEIR CLOSER PROXIMITY YOU HAD MENTIONED EARLY ON IN- AND SOMETHING YOU SAID EARLIER IN THE HEARING TODAY ABOUT- YOU KNOW JUST HAVING THAT DISTANCE AND EVEN TO JUST GET TO A PLACE ONE ACTION THAT WE HAVE BEEN TAKING AS SOMETHING AS A TAKE AWAY. IS THAT POST PANDEMIC- EVEN DURING POINT DEMOCRAT FORTY STARTED THIS IS RECRUITING FOR OUR SURVEYORS IN OUR STRIKE TEAMS ARE OUR INFECTION CONTROL SPECIALIST NOT NECESSARILY NEAR A BRICK AND MORTAR- HEALTH CARE FACILITY- A STATE HEALTH CARE FACILITY BROKEN WATER LOCATION AND SO- THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN DONE FOR YEARS WHERE WE'D HAVE YOU KNOW WE HAVE TWELVE DIFFERENT DISTRICT OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE. AND PEOPLE WOULD BE GENERALLY LOCATED NEAR THE DISTRICT OFFICE AND SOMETIMES HAVETO DRIVE TWELVE YOU KNOW FOUR TO FIVE HOURS JUST TO GET TO A FACILITY. SO NOW WE'RE DOING A VERY CONCENTRATED EFFORT TO DO STATEWIDE RECRUITMENT ESPECIALLY NOW IN THE DAYS THAT WERE BEING ABLE TO DO OUR OUR PROCESSES MORE ELECTRONICALLY SO THEY CAN BE ABLE TO TELL WORK AND WORK FROM HOME. AND BE MORE AGILE AND GET TO FACILITIES MUCH QUICKER THAN THEY HAD IN THE PAST AND SO I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT THAT APPRECIATE YOU- BROUGHT THAT UP EARLIER ABOUT JUST EVEN THE GEOGRAPHY. OF GETTING- TWO LOCATIONS FAST BUT WHEN WE DO SEND OUT A STRIKE TEAM ARE USUALLY ARE ARE HEALTHCARE CHOIR INSPECTIONS EXPERTS WHO WILL KIND OF GO OVER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE ARE JUST EFFECTIVE INFECTION CAN TROY MEASURES. AND THEN ALSO HAVE A REGULAR TEAM THOSE ARE SURVEYORS. THOSE ARE ONES THAT ARE GOING OUT FOR COMPLIANCE- WILL SITE FOR COMPLIANCE- WE HAVE HAD AN INCREASE- OVER THE COURSE THE DURATION WE HAD AN INCREASE OF UP WHAT WE CALL IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY. WHICH IS THE- MOST AGREE JUST FORM. A VIOLATION- AND THAT HAS NOW TAPER DOWN I NOTICED IN JULY WE HAD- LESS I CHASE AND WE DID IN BEIJING- THAT MAY AND JUNE AND- OF EARLY JULY SO I. THINK THAT'S IN A GOOD TREND. THAT WE'RE SEEING LESS OF THOSE TYPES OF SITUATIONS- PROBABLY BECAUSE WE'RE OUT THERE FOR- AND THEN THERE HAVE BEEN- SOME CASES WHERE WE STAY AND WE MIGHT. BE PHYSICALLY BT WE KEEP IN- PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SO KERN COUNTY IS ONE WHERE I KNOW SOME OF OUR STAFF HAD DAILY PHONE CALLS- EVERY DAY GOING OVER THE DIFFERENT FACILITIES WHAT ARE THEY SEEN ENTERING FACILITIES TOGETHER AS BOTH THE STATE. AND COUNTY PARTNER. ON THAT HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL- OF VENTURE WHENEVER WE CAN. BE MORE CLOSELY IN LINE WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH BETTER. I SEE PRE PANDEMIC. THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICES KIND OF DID THEIR THING AND THE- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DISTRICT OFFICES. DID THEIR PIECE BUT THEY RARELY INTERACTED AND SO THAT'S BEEN A BIG PIECE OF TRYING TO BRIDGE THOSE TWO KIND OF SILOS AND HAVING TO WORK TOGETHER- THAT'S ROUTE THE PANDEMIC BUT- WHAT I'D LIKETO SEE IS MORE OF THAT INTEGRATION EVEN POST PANDEMIC. I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH THE FACT OF THE TWO SILOS KIND OF CRASHING TOGETHER. ON A AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY- EVERY COUNTY THIS KIND OF BEEN DOING. WHAT WORKS FOR THEM AND THEIR COUNTY AND WILL WORKS FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS AND I THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY A NEED TO HAVE- SOME CONSENSUS ACROSS THE BOARD ACROSS THE STATE TO GET THAT COLLABORATION WORKING BETTER TOGETHER. ALL THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU. AND OBVIOUSLY YOU GET ASKED A LOT ABOUT TESTING. BUT I'M GETTING STORIES ALL THE TIME ABOUT PEOPLE WHO SIGNED UP TO GO TO A TESTING SITE FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY THEY DON'T MAKE IT AND THEN THEY GET A LETTER IN THE MAIL THE SAYS THEY TESTED POSITIVE EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN'T SHOW UP. SO I'M I'M HEARING THINGS LIKE THAT IN THOSE THOSE ARE. KIND OF THINGS THAT DRAW CONCERNS. WITH PEOPLE GETTING LETTERS EVEN THOUGH THEY AND GET TESTED. AND THEN THE OTHER THING WHAT ARE WE DOING AND WE TALK A LOT ON THE TESTING SITE BOY. I KNOW IN IN MY DISTRICT WE HAVE A LAB THAT'S LITERALLY VERIFYING ALL THE TESTS FOR FOUR OTHER COUNTIES. PHILLIPS OF THE TEST COMMAND THEY GO THERE THESE GUYS GO TROUGH AND GET THE RESULTS WHAT ARE WE DOING TO INCREASE. HELP THERE TO REDUCE THAT BACKLOG ON THAT TESTING SO WHAT IS BEING DONE. WITH THAT THAT WE TESTING TURN AROUND- HAPPENS MUCH MORE EFFICIENTLY. WELL YOUR FIRST QUESTION I WILL SAY THAT WHEN I'VE BEEN ON THIS TRIP THROUGHOUT THE CENTRAL VALLEY I HAVE HEARD THAT SAME- RUMOR WHERE PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THEY SIGNED UP FOR A TEST AND THEN- THEY RECEIVED A FALSE POSITIVE- A POSITIVE IN THE MAIL- HOWEVER THEY HAVEN'T YET BEEN ABLE TO TRACK THAT RUMOR DOWN. TO AN ACTUAL PERSON YET AT LEAST OF THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS THAT I TALKED TO BECAUSE THAT WAS ALSO VERY JARRING CONCERNING TO THEM AND EVERY TIME THAT THEY TRIED TO TRACK IT DOWN THE END UP BEING A FRIEND OF A FRIEND OR SISTERS BROTHERS. YOU KNOW NEIGHBORWORKS ADDRESS BUT THEY WERE NEVER ACTUALLY ABLE TO TRACK DOWN SO IF YOU ARE IF YOU HAVE YOU KNOW ANY INFORMATION OF WHEN THAT ACTUALLY HAS HAPPENED OR SOME SORT OF. PROOF FOR ACTION PLEASE SEND THAT TO THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OF THAT COUNTY BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THEY REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE TO TRACK THAT DOWN TO SEE. IF THERE ARE. IT EVERY TIME I HEAR ABOUT IT I'M LIKE. I SAID SAN EMAIL SAID MADE YOU KNOW SO WE ACTUALLY. SOMETHING IN SOME HARD EVIDENCE YEAH- TO VERIFY THESE CLAIMS- BUT I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN THE SECOND PART ON. WHAT WE'RE DOING TO. HANDLE THIS. GETTING THE ACTUAL RESULTS IN THESE LABS AND MAKING SURE YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE'VE WE'VE THROWN MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AT AT TESTING AND TRACK AND TRACE AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AND LITERALLY WERE TO THIS POINT OF. OKAY NOW YOU CAN YOU CAN DRIVE THROUGH YOU KNOW CVS PHARMACY AND GET A TEST. BY WAITING TWO WEEKS TO GET THE RESULTS JUST DOESN'T CUT IT. MMHM I TOTALLY AGREE- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD HAVE- SOMEONE FROM THE GOVERNOR'S TESTING TASK FORCE BE PART OF THE NEXT HEARING- TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER ALL THESE QUESTIONS- UNFORTUNATELY ALL OF THOSE- VERY VERY CRITICAL ISSUES AROUND TESTING TURN AROUND TIMES IS NOT UNDER MY PURVIEW AND I WILL I CERTAINLY PARTNER WITH THE TESTING TASK FORCE SYMBOL- CAN I DEFINITELY THINK WE NEED MORE REPRESENTATION HERE TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS I'M HONESTLY DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT- BUT BUT TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE IS. IS OUR OTHER THINGS BEING DONE OUR RESOURCES BEING SENT THAT DIRECTION IN INTO WHAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU CAN SPEAK ON- BUT WITHOUT STEPPING ON THE FEET OF THE OTHER OFFICE. DO YOU KNOW AT TWO YEAR AGAIN TODAY WHAT WHAT DO YOU SEE BEING DONE. AND FRANKLY FROM WHERE YOU'RE AT AS- DEPUTY DIRECTOR WHAT DO YOU THINK SHOULD BE BEING DONE. SO I KNOW THEY ARE WORKING FEVERISHLY- I'M TRYING TO INCREASE THE TESTING TURNAROUND TIMES. FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD IN THE FIELD IN JUST THE LAST WEEK- THE LONGEST TURNAROUND TIME- FROM A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WAS UPWARDS UP TO FIFTEEN DAYS- AND SOME OF THOSE SAME pVERY LENGTHY TURNAROUND TIMES. HAVE NOW MADE IT BACK IN TWO THREE DAYS WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY MUCH MORE WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE SO THAT LEAVES GIVES ME SOME AMOUNT OF- RELIEF KNOWING THAT THE TESTING TURN AROUND TIMES ARE IMPROVING- I THINK CRAIG WHEN IT ALSO MENTIONS- CMS'S RECENTLY ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS AND YOU- ANTIGEN TESTING- I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONTROVERSY AROUND THESE ANTIGEN TEST BECAUSE- THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME ADVOCACY RATE. AS A TRADITIONAL PCR TEST- AT THIS POINT THOUGH I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO BE REVISING- ARE TESTING AFL- ARTISTS IN ALL FACILITIES LETTER THAT WE SENT OUT- IT BECAUSE WE ARE LOOKING AT THE- DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND WHAT IS THE BENEFIT RIGHT IS IT BETTER TO HAVE A TEST IN A FACILITY THAT HAS LOW EFFICACY- BUT AT LEAST YOU HAVE- FASTER TURNAROUNDS ALL. OR IS IT BETTER TO WAIT RIGHT WELL WE OBVIOUSLY WOULD RATHER HAVE THE GOLD STANDARD TEST FOR THE SHORTER TURNAROUND. TIME OBVIOUSLY I THINK. IS GOING TO BE THEM BOTH CREDIT PIECE OF THIS. ELEMENT BECAUSE- YOU IN ORDER TO PROTECT THESE- MOST VULNERABLE- PEOPLE IN A FACILITY YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT INFORMATION SO YOU CAN QUICKLY QUICKLY- COHORT THEM APPROPRIATELY AND CONTAIN- OTHERWISE- YOU'RE ALREADY YOU'RE ALREADY BEHIND SEVEN DAYS FOURTEEN DAYS BEHIND- AND IT COULD SPREAD EVEN FARTHER THAN YOU DO. THANK YOU. BEFORE WE TRANSITION TO A CHAIR RAILS I DID JUST WANT TO MENTION IF I COULD DR CHAVEZ MAY BE A RESOURCE THAT WE CAN REACH OUT TO TOGETHER- HE IS- ONE OF THE CO CHAIRS- THAT SHE WAS REFERENCING AND AS AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST I'VE BEEN PARTICULARLY IMPRESSED WITH HIS- LINGUISTIC AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY THAT I THINK WILL HELP US BOTH WITHIN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- I DID WANT TO JUST SAY OF THE PASSING FOR GOING THROUGH THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND TO KINGS COUNTY I JUST. WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO RECOMMEND A SUPERIOR DAIRY FOR ICE CREAM. THE EVIDENCE. YOU RECOMMEND THAT BUT ALL ALSO ON THE READER DIRECTOR WHEN YOU ARE DOWN IN THE VALLEY- LET ME KNOW I'D LOVE TO MEET WITH YOU AND TACK ALONG WITH YOUR- AND SEE WHAT YOU GUYS ARE DOING BOOTS ON THE GROUND SO. WHAT I DO HAVE THOSE QUESTIONS FROM CONSTITUENTS I CONCEDE YOU KNOW I I'VE I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN THERE THAN ON GROUND WITH THEM. AND IT THAT WAY I CAN ACTUALLY REPORT BACK TO THE PUBLIC WHAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE I THINK. YOU KNOW THE IT'S THIS BIG MYSTERY OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON. AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S LACKING WITH THE TRANSPARENCY HERE SO OFTEN LOVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO ON THE FIELD WITH YOU SO I CAN ACTUALLY REPORT BACK TO CONSTITUENTS AND LET HIM KNOW FIRST HAND. WHAT'S GOING ON. RIGHT TO READ. I WASN'T GOING TO SAY THAT BUT THAT'S AN EXCELLENT SUGGESTION MISTER MATHIS AND THEN WHEN YOU ARE IN THE INLAND EMPIRE OR AND IF ANY OF YOUR TEAM IS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE PLEASE LET ME KNOW AND I WOULD IMAGINE THAT ANY OF THE LEGISLATORS ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES WOULD OFFER THE SAME THING I THINK FOR ANY OF US TO BE ABLE TO MEET WITH YOU AS YOU ARE DOING THE WORK OF THE STATE IT WOULD HELP US TO ALSO SPEAK WITH OUR- CONSTITUENTS- IT. MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO BUY CLOSING COMMENTS JUST TO THANK. ALL OF THE SPEAKERS TODAY. BUT MOST ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR PUTTING THIS HEARING TOGETHER. OTHERWISE WE WOULD HAVE LEFT. WITHOUT HAVING. HEARD EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITHOUT HAVING ALLOWED OUR STAKEHOLDERS. AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO KNOW THAT WE HEAR THEM. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE INCLUDED IN THIS PROCESS- SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. FOR PUTTING THAT TODAY'S HEARING TOGETHER THANK YOU. DR WOULD YES ARMISTEAD OCCUR I THINK UNFORTUNATELY YOU LEFT BUT I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOU BACK IF YOU DON'T. SORRY FOR THAT I'M HERE THAT'S OKAY THAT'S OKAY THIS IS- I KNOW WE'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT TESTING AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE A TASK FOR TESTING TASK FORCE AND THEN IT WAS SOMEWHAT DISBANDED NOW WE'VE GOT A NEW TESTING TASK FORCE AND- IN THE MIDDLE OF THAT WE'VE HAD CHALLENGES WITH TESTING IN. AND SO YOU'VE SAID THAT- THE FACILITIES- THAT SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. TEST 25% OF THEIR STAFF ON A WEEKLY BASIS. SO WHAT IS THE- CURRENT TURNAROUND TIME FOR THOSE STAFF THAT ARE BEING TESTED- SO EGGS SO THAT FOR THAT 25% WHEN YOU GET IN THE RESULTS BACK. FROM IT IS. THE AVERAGE HAS BEEN ANYWHERE FROM LAST I LOOKED AT THE AVERAGE AS IT WAS BETWEEN FIVE AND SEVEN DAYS BUT AGAIN I'VE SEEN TASKS THAT HAVE COME BACK WITHIN YOU KNOW FORTY EIGHT HOURS TO THREE DAYS AND THEN I'VE SEEN TEST LIKE I JUST MENTIONED THAT HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW REALLY A DEPLORABLE FOURTEEN FIFTEEN DAYS WHICH IS NOT USEFUL- AND ALL OF THAT IS BEING TRACKED BY THE TESTING TASK FORCE AND THAT ANY INFORMATION THAT I HEAR FROM THE FIELDER FROM MY STAFF OUT IN THE FIELD. I THEN OF COURSE YOU KNOW RAISE THAT UP OVER- TO THE TESTING TASK FORCE AS WELL AS I KNOW THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO WORK FOR WORK WITH DIFFERENT OPTIONS OUT THERE AND TRY TO MEET THE CAPACITY ISSUES THAT ARE THERE ARE GUESS I GET IT. IF THEN MY- IF YOU CAN GET NOT GET THERE IS. IF YOU'VE STILL GOT OUT BUYERS FOR YOU'RE NOT GETTING RESULTS WITHIN FIVE TO SEVEN DAYS- FOR THAT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. YOU'RE KIND OF FLYING BLIND IN FACILITIES AND THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S TROUBLING- I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS CONVERSATIONS WITH PEOPLE PUBLIC HEALTH REGARDING- TESTING AND THE CHALLENGES OF TESTING. AND THE FRUSTRATION IS THAT THERE ARE. CONTINUE TO BE LABORATORIES THAT HAVE CAPACITY. THAT ARE GROSSLY UNDER UTILIZED AND YET ON THE OTHER HAND WE'VE GOT LABORATORIES. THAT ARE DOING THE TESTING RESULTS ARE PROCESSING THE TESTING RESULTS. AND THAT ARE BEHIND AND THE DISCONNECT HERE CONTINUES TO BE REALLY REALLY TROUBLING- WHEN WE'VE GOT IN THIS IN THIS CITY. A LAB THAT HAS IT HAS A CAPACITY. THAT IS ONLY BEING USED AT THEIR THEIR THEIR ONLY RUNNING AT 20% CAPACITY. THAT'S PRETTY FRUSTRATING- TO KNOW WHEN WE'VE GOT OTHER COMMERCIAL LABORATORIES OUT THERE THAT ARE TAKING SO LONG AND SO I JUST. I'M KINDA AREA FRUSTRATION NOT AT YOU BUT IT'S A CONTINUED FRUSTRATION WITH TESTING IN GENERAL- THAT CONTINUES TO BE A PROBLEM- THE AND I DO WONDER BECAUSE WE HAD THIS HASN'T COME HAS NOT COME UP. IN THIS IS- I THINK AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AS WELL- AND THAT'S THE ISSUE AROUND CONTACT TRACING SO WHEN YOU DO HAVE. EMPLOYEES THAT TEST POSITIVE IN FACILITIES- HOW VIGOROUS IS THE CONTACT TRACING OR IS IT HAPPENING AT ALL BECAUSE IN SO I THINK IN SOME AREAS THEY'VE KIND OF THROWN UP THEIR HANDS ON CONTACT TRACING. BUT OTHERS ARE STILL BEING MORE VIGOROUS ABOUT IT SO WHAT IS THE STATUS OF CONTACT TRACING WHAT IS THE DEPARTMENT'S POLICY WHAT YOUR YOUR YOU KNOW WITH RELATION TO- SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND IS THAT. IS THAT A UNIVERSAL IT IS IN OTHER WORDS IS BEING DONE UNIVERSALLY WITH FACILITIES OR IS IT JUST KIND OF LOOSEY GOOSEY DEPENDING ON WHAT COUNTY AROUND. WELL OF THE COMMENT ON YOUR FIRST- OBSERVATION THAT YES IT'S NOT SO MUCH A CAPACITY ISSUE BUT A MATCHING ISSUE RIGHT WHERE YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME LABS THAT ARE RUNNING ABOVE AND BEYOND THEIR CAPACITY- AND THEN YOU HAVE OTHER LABS THAT ARE RUNNING BELOW. THE CAN PASS. AND THAT'S BEEN A LOT OF THE CONVERSATION I'VE HAD WHEN I HAVE MY WEEKLY CALLS WITH ALL OF THE FACILITIES IS. MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE LOOKING BEYOND YOUR REGION YOU MIGHT FIND A LAB THAT HAS- THE TESTING TURN AROUND TIME TO BE MUCH MORE IN YOUR FAVOR. BUT IT MIGHT BE FRTHER AWAY AND SO I'M ALWAYS REFERENCING THAT TESTING TASK FORCE WEBSITE BECAUSE THAT WEBSITE DOES SHOW THE AVERAGE TURNAROUND TIMES. AND THE CAPACITY LEVEL AT THAT FACILITY SO I AGREE THAT IS A FRUSTRATION THAT WEEK WE HAVE CAPACITY IS ABOUT MATCHING- I'M AS FAR AS CONTACT TRACING AND THAT'S BEEN PART OF THE REASON WHY WE'VE BEEN DOING THESE- IN PERSON VISITS WITH ALL OF THE- LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH- BECAUSE LOCAL LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH- ARE THE- ONES WHO ARE THE CONTACT TRACERS THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE DOING THE BULK OF THE POT CONTACT TRACING. IN THESE FACILITIES- I KNOW THAT MANY OF THEM DO- PRIORITIZE AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS- FIRST OF ALL. ABOVE OTHERS WHEN THEY'RE DOING THEIR CONTACT TRACING I'VE MET WITH SOME COUNTIES WHO HAVE BEEN UP TO SPEED WITH ALL THEIR CONTACT TRACING I'VE BEEN WITH OTHER COUNTIES WHO SAID THEY REALLY AVE A BACKLOG WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR CONTRACT TRACING. AND SOME OF THE BEST PRACTICES AND THINGS THAT WE ARE SEEN ARE YOU SEEN- YOUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND REALLY BUILDING OUT YOUR% LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH CONTACT TRACING GROUP. BEYOND JUST THE GOVERNMENT SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF COMMUNITIES OUT THERE WHO IF YOU GET A CALL FROM SOMEONE WHO'S FROM ANY KIND OF GOVERNMENT. WHO ASKED THEM YOU KNOW WE'RE IF YOU'VE BEEN IN THE LAST FOURTEEN DAYS YOU'RE NOT ALWAYS GOING TO GET HONEST RESPONSES BECAUSE THERE'S THAT LACK OF TRUST. IN SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHICH HAS BEEN POSITIVE MODELS I WANT TO SEE FRESNO WAS ONE COUNTY AND WENT TO THAT WAS REALLY TRYING TO REACH OUT MORE AND DO MORE WITH A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION LEADERS. AND HAVE THEM REALLY SERVE AS A GREAT OPORTUNITY OR A GREAT RESOURCE FOR- CONTACT TRACY. SO THAT TRUSTED PEOPLE. SHE NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO GET ACCURATE INFORMATION THEY'VE SEEN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT MODELS FROM EACH- PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICE AND- ASK FOR VISITING AND WORKING AND TALKING WITH EACH COUNTY- ANYTHING THAT'S A BEST PRACTICE IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM WHETHER IT BE BUSINESSES RE OPENING OR CONTACT TRACING. WE ARE- PROVIDING ALL THAT INFORMATION BACK UP- TO THE EMERGENCY SEARCH TASK FORCE AT THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER. AND YOU FOR THAT. AND THIS. THIS GOES TO JUST A GENERAL KIND OF A GENERAL PET PEEVE IS NOT DIRECTED AT YOU. PLEASE SO DON'T DON'T TAKE IT THAT WAY- BUT IT IS- I THINK KIND OF THE GENESIS OF THIS WHOLE HEARING IS AROUND COMMUNICATION AND- WE DON'T REALLY LIKE SURPRISES. YOU KNOW I MEAN MAYBE GOOD SURPRISE US BUT WE DON'T LIKE TO BE CONCORD QUITE FRANKLY- AND SO I THINK THE WAY THE LONG TERM CARE HOME THING ROLLED OUT. WAS A BIG SURPRISE TO US AND WE DIDN'T WE AND I THINK- YOU'RE YOU'RE HEARING. IT HEARING THAT IN GENERAL. WE REGARD JUST ENJOY THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION FROM ADMINISTRATION TO LEGISLATORS- HAS HAS BEEN EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING AND THAT'S PART THAT'S A BIG PART OF THIS TODAY. BECAUSE WE KNOW OUR DISTRICTS REALLY WELL AND SO THE IDEA THAT E COULD REACH OUT TO COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO HELP AMPLIFY MESSAGES. THAT COULD BE HELPFUL. FOR THESE KINDS OF THINGS HASN'T HAPPENED VERY MUCH. IT'S STARTING TO HAPPEN MORE BUT- A LOT OF THINGS COME OUT. THEY'RE NOT INTERPRETED CORRECTLY YOU THE THEIR THEIR VAGUE IN SOME CASES OR NOT AND IF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HE GOT FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTIES IN FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF THINGS PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED- AND THEN YOU HAVE POPULATIONS OF FOLKS WHO WHO DON'T TRUST A GOVERNMENT. AND SO THE INABILITY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO WE WHO WHO WHO TRUST US AND PASS ON SOME THESE MESSAGES HAS IS REALLY HAMPERING US- I EXPERTS EXPERIENCES DURING FIRES IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN- WE'VE GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WERE DISPLACED AND A LOT OF PEOPLE IN OUR LATINO COMMUNITY BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION AND ICE. WE'RE REALLYRELUCTANT TO COME AND GET INFORMATION- AT TOWN HALLS AND SO WE WENT OUT OF OUR WAY TO SET UP A SEPARATE KIND OF TOWN HALLS WITH TRUSTED COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO GET THE MESSAGES OUT. AND IT JUSTFEELS LIKE THAT SOMETHING WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DOING FROM THE BEGINNING AND SO AND IT FEELS LIKE IT'S JUST BEGINNING TO ROLL ROLL OUT AND THAT'S YOU KNOW WE'RE MONTHS INTO THIS NOW. AND. YOU KNOW I JUST URGE. HOWEVER MY BE ON THEIR LIST. WE ARE IN WE KNOW OUR DISTRICTS AND CAN AMPLE THE MESS AND BUT WE'RE NOT. REALLY BEING ENGAGED IN THAT WAY AND THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S A HUGE SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CHAIR WOULD SIGNAL MOTHER MORE QUESTION I MAY DIRECTOR LIKE BORN UP TO THE MICROPHONE IF I CAN. WELL WE'RE DOING THAT I'M I WILL SAY THAT DIRECTOR STILL OCCUR YOU FOR AND PA. TRACING I WOULD REMISS NOT TO THAT WERE OVER A DAYS IN THIS. AND STILL ARE WAITING FOR. OF THAT CONTRACT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND AND- I THINK IT GIVES US A CHANCE TO REALLY REFLECT AND- AS DIRECTOR WADE SAID TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN RISE OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC STRONGER. AND STILL HELP US TO REIMAGINE THE FUTURE. I TOO AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE SILOS AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER. AND IF I CAN I WANT TO NOW TURN TO WHAT I BELIEVE WAS- KAREN KIESLER QUESTIONS. AND SEE IF COULD WHY DOES THE STATE PLAN AMENDMENT NEED TO GET DONE BY THE END OF THE YEAR. JERRY LAI I APOLOGIZE ON BEHALF OF THE DIRECTOR LIKE PORN HE HAD A CALL WITH CMS THAT HE HAD TO TAKE SO- HIS TEAM IS WATCHING AND WE WILL TAKE THAT BACK BUT HE HAS TO SEND HIS REGRETS AT THIS MOMENT WE APOLOGIZE. GREAT AND I APPRECIATED I HAVE NOT BEEN ONE. LIMIT AND TO BELIEVE THAT PROCESS ALLOWS FOR BETTER TRANSPARENCY AND SO- THE HEARING DID AND- USUALLY GOES LONG BECAUSE I THINK IT NEEDS TO BE ROBUST AND- DELIBERATIVE- BUT IF YOU CAN ON THE SECOND QUESTION AGAIN IS THE ONE I ASKED IN THE FIRST PANEL. I'M STILL WAITING TO HEAR A COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN THE LEGISLATURE. AS YOU ENGAGE IN BOTH SHORT TERM WORK. AND DEVELOP ANY LONG TERM PROPOSAL THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED IN PART OF THE PUBLIC PROCESS FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WHICH THE ABSOLUTELY WE AND I WE TAKE YOUR POINT AT THAT THE LAW TERM CARE HOME WHAT OF THE BILL HAD BEEN UP WITH PLANS FOR NEW NEW ALSO THERE IS NO ALREADY IN THAT HAS NOT FULLY COMMUNICATED WE TAKE THAT AND THEN OF COURSE TODAY'S ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO DEEP IN THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE SO THERE ARE NO SURPRISES. THAT'S ALSO I'VE TAKEN TO HEART AND MORE TO COME ON THAT FRONT. WITHOUT I WILL THINK. PANEL AND- PRESENTATION AND WILL NOW TURN TO PUBLIC COMMENT.
