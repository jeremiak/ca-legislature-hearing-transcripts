OF BIKE IS FUN BUT E. BIKES ARE

00:41:02.493 --> 00:41:04.595
SPECIAL AND THEIR UTILITY FOR

00:41:04.662 --> 00:41:06.897
TRANSPORTATION. THEY MAKE

00:41:06.964 --> 00:41:10.000
PREVIOUSLY IMPRACTICAL TRICKS

00:41:10.067 --> 00:41:13.037
SUDDENLY PRACTICAL- THAT STUDY

00:41:13.103 --> 00:41:15.272
OF NORTH AMERICAN E. BIKE USERS

00:41:15.339 --> 00:41:17.208
THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CITED

00:41:17.274 --> 00:41:19.543
ALSO DISCOVERED THAT THE TOP

00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:21.512
FOUR REASONS PEOPLE CITED FOR

00:41:21.579 --> 00:41:23.514
NOT BIKING FOR TRANSPORTATION.

00:41:23.581 --> 00:41:25.616
ARE THERE TOO MANY HILLS THE

00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:26.817
DISTANCES TO FAR THEY DIDN'T

00:41:26.884 --> 00:41:28.719
WANT TO ARRIVE SWEATY BIKING

00:41:28.786 --> 00:41:30.688
WAS TOO SLOW. E. BIKES TAKE

00:41:30.754 --> 00:41:32.289
AWAY ALL THOSE REASONS THAT

00:41:32.356 --> 00:41:33.324
FLATTENED HILLS REMOVE

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:37.361
HEADWINDS THEY MAKE IT SO YOU

00:41:37.428 --> 00:41:37.962
DON'T HAVE TO GET SWEATY TO GO

00:41:38.028 --> 00:41:38.596
FAST. YEAH PEOPLE TO RIDE BIKES

00:41:38.662 --> 00:41:40.464
IS CRITICAL BECAUSE AS WAS

00:41:40.531 --> 00:41:41.899
MENTIONED WE NEED TO REDUCE OUR

00:41:41.966 --> 00:41:43.801
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOALS

00:41:43.868 --> 00:41:46.537
WE SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD IT'S NOT

00:41:46.604 --> 00:41:48.372
POSSIBLE TO QUICKLY ENOUGH

00:41:48.439 --> 00:41:50.774
ELECTRIFY OUR CAR FLEET WE HAVE

00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:52.243

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:53.844
ALTERNATIVES TO THE CAR AND THE

00:41:53.911 --> 00:41:56.981
BIKE IS A GREAT ALTERNATIVE.

00:41:57.047 --> 00:41:59.683
THAT SAME STUDY FOUND THAT OF

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:03.621
THE E. BIKE USERS WHO HAD NOT

00:42:03.687 --> 00:42:05.789
RIDDEN A BIKE AS AN ADULT. 94%

00:42:05.856 --> 00:42:07.691
OF THEM BECAME DAILY OR WEEKLY

00:42:07.758 --> 00:42:10.427
RIGHT SO IT REALLY IS THE THING

00:42:10.494 --> 00:42:11.395
THAT GETS SOMEONE TO RIDE A

00:42:11.462 --> 00:42:12.496
BIKE AND HAD RIDDEN A BIKE

00:42:12.563 --> 00:42:14.365
BEFORE IT'S A GREAT ALTERNATIVE

00:42:14.431 --> 00:42:15.633
TO A CAR THIS PROGRAM GETS

00:42:15.699 --> 00:42:17.201
IMPLEMENTED. WE CAN SUPPORT

00:42:17.268 --> 00:42:18.302
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:20.237

BEING INVITED HERE TO PROVIDE

00:42:48.565 --> 00:42:50.100
SOME TESTIMONY ABOUT WHAT THEY

00:42:50.167 --> 00:42:52.169
SEE ON A DAILY BASIS IN MY OWN

00:42:52.236 --> 00:42:54.104
COMMUNITY MY NAME'S CORRINA

00:42:54.171 --> 00:42:55.572
CONSIDERED OUTSIDE THE COUNCIL

00:42:55.639 --> 00:42:57.775
MEMBER REPRESENTING DISTRICT

00:42:57.841 --> 00:42:59.576
ONE IN THE CITY OF THIS STUFF.

00:42:59.643 --> 00:43:04.648
IT IS A DISTRICT THAT HAS TWO

00:43:04.715 --> 00:43:09.153
MAIN TRANSIT CORRIDORS IN A

00:43:09.219 --> 00:43:13.190
DISTRICT WHERE A LOT OF

00:43:13.257 --> 00:43:15.993
INDIVIDUALS. RESIDING USE

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:19.196
EITHER THEIR FEET TO WALK ONE

00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:20.564
PLACE TO ANOTHER- THEY USED

00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:23.434
BICYCLES. AND ONE THING THAT

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:25.869
I'VE NOTICED IS THAT I'VE SEEN

00:43:25.936 --> 00:43:28.505
AN UPTICK IN INDIVIDUALS THAT

00:43:28.572 --> 00:43:29.873
ARE BIKING TO AND FROM WHERE

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.743
THEY NEED TO GO. I'VE SEEN MORE

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:35.546
E. BIKES ON THE ROAD BUT WHAT I

00:43:35.612 --> 00:43:38.782
DEFINITELY SEE IS A BIG DIVIDE

00:43:38.849 --> 00:43:42.019
BETWEEN THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD AN

00:43:42.086 --> 00:43:45.089
INVITE AND THOSE WHO CAN'T. SO

00:43:45.155 --> 00:43:47.725
WHAT IS POSSIBLE WITH A YES

00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:50.995
VOTE ON AB ONE SEVENTEEN. IS

00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:52.663
THAT WE CAN MOVE TOWARDS

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:54.631
EMBRACING MORE ACTIVE

00:43:54.698 --> 00:43:57.601
TRANSPORTATION. WHILE WEARING

00:43:57.668 --> 00:44:00.404
R. V. AND T. AND PROVIDING A

00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:03.340
MORE SUSTAINABLE AND EQUITABLE

00:44:03.407 --> 00:44:05.109
MULTI MODAL TRANSPORTATION

00:44:05.175 --> 00:44:10.881
OPTION. NOW YOU KNOW HE BY.

00:44:10.948 --> 00:44:12.249
REAL AN EQUITABLE SOLUTION FOR

00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:13.717
MANY FOLKS EVERY DAY

00:44:13.784 --> 00:44:17.287
TRANSPORTATION MEANS ESPECIALLY

00:44:17.354 --> 00:44:17.788
FOR FIRST AND LAST MILE

00:44:17.855 --> 00:44:20.491
PROBLEMS. THE CURRENT COSTS TO

00:44:20.557 --> 00:44:22.826
BE BY MAKES THEM INACCESSIBLE

00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:24.595
TO MOST IN OUR COMMUNITY

00:44:24.661 --> 00:44:26.096
ESPECIALLY FOR FAMILIES WITH

00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:28.599
CHILDREN THAT WOULD NEED TO

00:44:28.665 --> 00:44:31.135
PURCHASE SEVERAL QUITE. I

00:44:31.201 --> 00:44:32.269
