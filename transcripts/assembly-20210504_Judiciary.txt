ASSEMBLY ILL SEVEN FOUR SIX WILL CODIFY THE ELIMINATION OF AMERICA MINIMUM MARRIAGE REQUIREMENT INTO LAW THAT APPLIES TO ALL COUPLES SEEKING A STEP PARENT ADOPTION. AND ENSURES THAT PARENTAGE LAWS REFLECTING FURTHER PROTECT OUR FAMILIES IN OUR STATE. HISTORICALLY SAME SEX COUPLES ARE MET WITH MORE OBSTACLES TO BECOME ADOPTIVE PARENTS IN COMPARISON TO THEIR HETEROSEXUAL COUNTERPARTS ADOPTION HAS NOT BEEN EASY FOR THE LGBTQ I A PLUS COMMUNITY. FOR MANY DECADES LGBT Q. ARE A PLUS COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BANNED FROM ADOPTING CHILDREN EITHER DUE TO LEGAL BARRIERS BECAUSE OF DISCRIMINATION OR THE MULTI LAYERED PROCESS MANY GO THROUGH TO HAVE CHILDREN. OUR CURRENT LAWS ARE ALLOWING MANY FAMILIES TO ENCOUNTER EXPLICIT- COVERED DISCRIMINATION WHEN THEY ATTEMPT TO FILE FOR ADOPTION THIS PROCESS SHOULD NOT BE CHALLENGING BUT RATHER SEAMLESS CALIFORNIA PROVIDES MANY PROTECTIONS FOR NON BIOLOGICAL PARENTS WHO HAVE BEEN ADOPTED. BUT MANY STATES DO NOT THIS IS WHY EXPEDIENCY IN THE PROCESS IS IMPORTANT. OUR LAWS DO NOT PROHIBIT COURTS FROM USING THEIR DISCRETION TO AT A MINIMUM ARRIAGE PERIOD COUNTY WIDE BEFORE COUPLES CAN TAKE A STEP PARENT ADOPTION. THE MISALIGNMENT OF EXPLICIT PROHIBITION HAS LED TO CONFUSION AND AMBIGUITY IN PRACTICE. SAM IS GOING TO THE STEP PARENT ADOPTION PROCESS ALREADY ENCOUNTER A CONFUSING AND COMPLEX SYSTEM WITH STATE AND COUNTY POLICIES THAT VARY ACROSS THE STATE WE MUST ENSURE THAT WE REMOVE BARRIERS THAT HINDER AND PROLONG THE PROCESS FOR FAMILIES ESPECIALLY LGBTQ I A- PLUS COUPLES WHO.

HI GOOD MORNING JERRY MEMBERS JERRY DOESN'T END WITH THE PROFESSIONAL FIDUCIARY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA ARE CONCERNED WITH MEASURE S. EXPRESSED IN THE- COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND SHARED WITH TAX- IS THAT THE NOTICE PROVISIONS AS CURRENTLY WORDED BUT ACCOMPLISHED ANY PROPERTY THAT TECHNICALLY HAS NO MONETARY VALUE AND WOULD TRIGGER A NOTICE APARTMENT IN ALL CASES. YOU'LL MISS AND TURN A COULD TRIGGER PETITIONS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES REGRDING THE RIGHT TO VALUE LIST PARK- PROPERTY UP AND LIKELY BETWEEN FAMILY MEMBERS THAT WILL BURDEN THE PARTS AND FOR THAT REASON WE CONTINUE WITH OUR POSITION. IN OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE AT THIS TIME. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. BEIN. FORTY NINE. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES YES. SO WE'VE GONE UP WITH THE CONSERVATORSHIP REFORM PROJECT AND THE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL IS THAT LIKE. ALMOST THE ENTIRE SECTIONS OF THE PROBATE CODE THAT RELATE TO CONSERVATORSHIP IS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY KEY. THERE'S NO- PENALTY FOR FAILING TO GIVE NOTICE. ABOUT THESE- POSSESSIONS WHICH ARE SOMETIMES THE ONLY WAY THAT A PERSON WITH DEMENTIA CAN RECOGNIZE THE ROOM- IS BY HAVING A PICTURE OF THEMSELVES AN OLD ONE. SO I WOULD URGE THE COMMITTEE TO AMEND THIS BILL. SO THAT THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR FAILING TO GIVE NOTICE JUST LIKE WE HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR FAILING TO PAY TAXES ARE UNDER REPORTING TAXES OR DRIVING BEYOND THE SPEED LIMIT- UNFORTUNATELY WE SEE ALL TOO OFTEN CONSERVATORS IGNORING. B. STATUTES THAT THE LEGISLATURE JEFF FAST AND THEN THE COURT BRUSHING IT UNDER THE RUG SO- I WOULD SUGGEST A PENALTY ENFORCEABLE IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT OR A CIVIL COURT NOT NECESSARILY THE PROBATE COURT TO ENSURE THAT DENTURE. POLICY IS IN FACT HONORED AND NOT SIMPLY IGNORED. THANK YOU. SURE THERE IS NO ONE UP TO TAKE NOTE THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I'M GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THEN QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SINGH NATT MISTER MATHIS YOU MAY CLOSE.

THE BILLS OUT THANK YOU THE TEXAS TO OUR ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB TWO FIFTY FIVE CONSUMER TUCCI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN AND GOOD MORNING. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M HERE TO PRESENT. AB TWO FIVE FIVE THE COVER NINETEEN SMALL BUSINESS EVICTION RELIEF FACT. AS WE ALL KNOW THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN DEVASTATING ON SMALL BUSINESSES AND ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS. OVER ALREADY SHUT DOWN. OR AT RISK OF SHUTTING DOWN. WITH MANY OF THOSE CONCENTRATED IN EMIGRANT AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WHILE OUR ECONOMY IS STARTING TO RE OPEN SMALL BUSINESSES ARE SAYING THE SAME THINGS THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM A RESIDENTIAL TENANTS THAT THEY'RE BEING SADDLED WITH THE DEBT. OF UNPAID RENT. LAST FALL I WENT ON SEVERAL TOURS OF SMALL BUSINESSES IN MY DISTRICT. AND I WAS REALLY STRUCK BY HOW I WAS HEARING. HI I LIKE LIKE THE FACT THAT MR CHIU IS WALKING IN BECAUSE I WANTED REFERENCE A YOU KNOW I WAS HEARING THE SAME THINGS THAT I WAS HEARING. IN TERMS OF OUR RESIDENTIAL TENANTS. READ RELIEF AN EVICTION RELIEVE DEBATE WITHOUT THE BILL THAT. WE PASSED LAST YEAR AB THREE ZERO EIGHT EIGHT. THE SMALL BUSINESSES THE TENANTS THE COMMERCIAL TENANTS. THEY WERE SAYING THE SAME THINGS THAT WE ARE HEARING FROM A RESIDENTIAL TENANTS. TO GIVE US SOME FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO PAY OUR RENT YOU KNOW I WAS TALKING TO RESTAURANT OWNERS AND- THE THEY THEY COULDN'T OPERATE THERE IS SAYING THAT YOU KNOW WE CAN PAY OUR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE WE GOT THE PPP. LOANS BUT- WE CAN'T PAY OUR RENT AND WE TRY TO NEGOTIATE WITH THEIR LANDLORDS AND WHILETHE GOOD THE GOOD SO CALLED GOOD LANDLORDS. THEY WOULD GIVE THEM BREAKS THEY WOULD WORK WITH THEM. BUT TOO MANY OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE HEARD FROM THEY WERE SAYING THAT- THEY WERE NOT- GETTING ANY BREAK FROM THEIR LANDLORDS. AND SO THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO IS TRY TO GIVE THEM A BREAK IS TRYING TO GIVE US SOME FLEXIBILITY SO THAT SMALL BUSINESS COMMERCIAL TENANTS CAN WORK WITH THEIR LANDLORDS. IF DATE SUBMIT A CERTIFICATE OF HARDSHIP SO THAT THEY'VE- SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN REVENUES DURING THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH REGULATIONS. THAT AND THE LANDLORD HAS TO ENGAGE IN A GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATION- IN ORDER TO TRY TO WORK WITH THEM TO GIVE THEM A PAYMENT SCHEDULE. THIS BILL. SEEKS TO TAKE A BALANCED APPROACH AGAIN YOU KNOW SOME OF THE LESSONS I LEARNED FROM OUR RESIDENTIAL TENANT DEBATE THAT- WHILE WE WANT TO HELP OUR- OUR SMALL BUSINESS TENANTS. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THE LANDLORDS ALSO RELY ON THE REVENUES FROM THE RENT- AND SO THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IN THE CASE WHERE. LANDLORDS CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY WOULD SUFFER A SIGNIFICANT HARDSHIP IF THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO- COLLECT- THE RENT TO AS AS THEIR TENANTS THEIR COMMERCIAL SMALL BUSINESS CENTER ASKING FOR. THAT THEY WOULD BE DEEMED TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS SO AGAIN I THINK THIS IS TAKE TRYING TO TAKE A- YOU KNOW A BALANCED- REASONABLE APPROACH TO WORK WITH OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WORK WITH THERE ARE. COMMERCIAL LANDLORDS THAT'S IT FOR A TRY TO PROVIDE THEM SOME EVICTION RELIEF. I HEAR IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL IS DIANE MATSUDA A STAFF ATTORNEY- WITH THE ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER LEGAL OUTREACH.

MISTER SHARON MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS IS MATTHEW HARPER WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUSINESS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION ALSO HERE TODAY WORKING WITH THE BUILDING OWNERS AND MANAGERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA THE INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF SHOPPING CENTERS AND NAY OFF OF CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL NOW- BUT WE ARE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND THANK YOUR STAFF VERY VERY MUCH FOR- THE LOOK THEY AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED- WE ARE WORKING TO REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION- AT WITH THE OFFER WE HAVE A NEW AMENDMENT THAT WILL BE ASKING FOR AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THE PROCESS BUT WE LOOK. FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE OFTEN HAVE STAFF- COMMERCIAL TENANTS AND LANDLORDS BOTH THE STRAGGLERS TROUBLE TO COLLECT SHUTDOWNS- OUR MEMBERS ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO WORK WITH THEIR TENANTS BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT OPEN SPACES ONCE WE COME OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC IN THAT- PROPERTIES OPEN BACK UP- WITHIN OUR MEMBERSHIP WE HAVE YET TO TRACK DOWN ANY COMMERCIAL LANDLORD WHO'S NOT WORKING WITH THEIR TENANTS BECAUSE. THEY WANT TO KEEP THOSE TENANTS AND STATE. YEAH KNOW THAT THEIR PUBLIC OUT THE- BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW. THAT OUR INDUSTRY IS WORKING WITH TENANTS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T BENEFIT ANYONE TO HAVE OPEN COMMERCIAL SPACES. THE ONE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS IDEA AND AB THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT. IS ON THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE YOU ALL PROVIDED FUNDING FOR A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM. TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. THE RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM WORKED ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE THERE IS NO FUNDING CONNECTED TO THIS BILL. SO THAT HAVE BEEN PART OF OUR STRUGGLE OF WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND MAKING SURE THAT WE COULD COME. TO LANGUAGE THAT WE CAN PULL OUR OPPOSITION ON. SO WITH THAT AGAIN WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR YOUR STAFF AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH- EVERYONE MOVING FORWARD AND HOPE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO PULL OPPOSITION SEN. THANK YOU THANK YOU.

BETTER FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE BUT THERE ARE SOME OF THE MAIN ISSUES THAT WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH BUT AGAIN WATER KNOWLEDGE TO- WORK BY DR WORKING WITH OUR WITH OUR CLIENTS AND THE INDUSTRY. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. LINE. SIXTEEN YES SIR GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CREAM GREASY ON THE APP THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS NOT A NATION THANK YOU THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR THERE IS NO ONE ELSE TO SIGNAL THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MAY CLOSE THE LINES ON AB. TWO FIFTY FIVE IT'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENT WAS DAVIS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M OBVIOUSLY- LANDLORDS AS WELL SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN HIT BUT THIS AND THERE IS NO FINANCIAL- BACK UP HERE. MY ONLY QUESTION HERE IS YOU KNOW THE LANDLORD MUST ENGAGE IN GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS. WHAT IS GOOD FATE THAT'S MY CONCERN IS THAT IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S OPEN VERY MUCH SO PERHAPS THE- LANDLORD THINGS THAT WAS GOOD FAITH WHAT HE DID BUT THE TENANT DOESN'T FEEL THAT WAY. AND THAT'S WHERE YOU KNOW IT'S KIND OF LIKE IF THERE WAS A GUY YOU DID THIS THIS AND THIS AND THIS. AND THAT WAY THEY COULD DO CHECK WITH KNOWING THAT OR IF I DID ALL THAT. IT THAT'S THAT'S GOOD. YES- SO. TO COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. SUGGESTS WE WILL CONTINUE TO- GIVE MORE DETAIL TO WHAT THAT MEANS- TO HAVE A GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATION BUT- I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. YOU KNOW I THINK WE'RE ADDRESSING THE MAIN CONCERN OF. OF THE BUSINESS PROPERTY OWNERS WHEN WE- SPECIFICALLY INSERTED THE PROVISION. INDICATED THAT THEY WOULD- A LANDLORD WOULD BE DEEMED TO BE IN COMPLIANCE. IF THEY COULD DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY WOULD BE IN FINANCIAL HARDSHIP- WITH THE- THE AND THE TERMS OF THE- THAT THE- THE RENT- NEGOTIATIONS THEY'RE THEY'RE TAKING PLACE. SO IF THAT WOULD. YOU KNOW BASICALLY GIVE LIKE AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO AN AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE DEFENSE IF THE LANDLORD CAN SHOW THAT. THEY CAN'T PAY THEIRMORTGAGE THEY CAN'T PAY THEIR- PROPERTY TAXES IT SAID OR ALL THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD. FROM THE RESIDENTIAL TENANCY BAIT- THEN THEY WOULD BE DEEMED IN COMPLIANCE BUT IT. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK OUT PERFECTLY. I THINK THAT'S ALL I WANT TO SEE THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY GUIDELINES THERE SO THAT IT'S AND- YOU KNOW. THERE'S NO QUESTION WHATSOEVER SO THAT BOTH OF THEM ARE PROTECTED. THANK YOU APPRECIATE IT. THANK YOU RESEARCH. THANK YOU MISTER CHARGED ONE UP THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TACKLING THIS AND IMPORTANT. I THINK EVERYONE OF US- HAVE HEARD FROM COUNTLESS SMALL BUSINESS TENANTS REALLY STRUGGLING DURING THIS TIME PERIOD AND- I FOR ONE REALLY APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION THIS PAST YEAR ROUND RESIDENTIAL TENANTS BUT THIS IS OBVIOUSLY AN AREA- THAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TACKLE I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY- JUST REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR- WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS ON THIS I KNOW HE'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT AND- WITH THAT HAPPEN TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND MOVE IT UP. OR MAKE MOTION MOVING OUT TODAY THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION IS THERE A SECOND. AND A SECOND. THANK YOU. THREE HOURS. YEAH SO- THANK YOU MISTER MERRETT TO CHEAT. SO MY CONCERN HERE IS THAT YOU KNOW LET BOTH PARTIES ARE IN A BAD SITUATION HERE- BOTH COMMERCIAL TENANTS AND THE SMALL BUSINESS THAT IS A COMMERCIAL LANDLORD AND THE SMALL BUSINESS WHO IS A COMMERCIAL TENANT- MY CONCERN HERE IS YOU KNOW IT IS VERY BIG AND THEY'RE ALWAYS TOLD AND LAW SCHOOL YOU KNOW NEVER WRITE A CONTRACT THAT SAYS TABLE REASONABLY NEGOTIATE THE TERMS OF THE NEXT CONTRACT BECAUSE THERE'S REALLY NO WAY TO DEFINE THAT- AND SO WHAT YOU OFTEN DO AS YOU SAY HEY YOU KNOW YOU CAN EITHER RE UP ON THE SAME TERMS- YOU RIGHT EXACTLY THE SPECIFIC TO. WANT SO THERE'S NOT THIS PROBLEM LATER- AND SO WITH THAT LANGUAGE IN THERE CURRENTLY AT I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE PROBLEMATIC REALLY FOR BOTH SIDES BECAUSE HOW DO YOU DETERMINE BOTH WHAT IS GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATION. AND THEN WHAT'S A REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO REPAY- AND I THINK THE BETTER WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS IS REALLY WHAT WE'VE ALREADY DONE WHICH IS YOU KNOW AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE HAD PPP- THAT DIDN'T NECESSARILY HELP A LOT OF COMMERCIAL LANDLORDS. ESPECIALLY SMALL MOM AND POPS AND THAT'S WHO I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT IS GOING TO GET. HURT HERE THE SOPHISTICATED. LARGE COMMERCIAL LANDLORDS ARE GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MANAGE THIS- WITH NO THEY HAVE STAFF THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE MANAGING THESE PROPERTIES. IS A SMALL MOM AND POP LANDLORDS WHO'S ALREADY BEEN OUT. THE MONEY. IT'S BEEN STRUGGLING THROUGH THIS- THE TENET IS ALSO STRUGGLE TO THIS BUT- PROVIDING THE SUPPORT. THE SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS THAT WE PASSED THIS YEAR IN ADDITION OF THE FEDERAL MONEY THAT'S COME IN THERE I THINK IT'S GOING TO HELP THESE BUSINESSES. MAKE IT THROUGH AND NATURALLY. IN THE MARKET THIS IS WHAT'S GOING ON ALREADY- I MEAN NO COMMERCIAL LANDLORD REALLY WANTS TO LOSE THEIR TENANTS. AND THEN HAVE TO GO LOOK FOR ANOTHER ONE- IT'S ONLY WHEN THERE'S JUST. WHEN THIS IS JUST NOT GOING TO WORK ANYMORE THAT. YOU KNOW THE PARTIES MOVE ON- AND- I THINK THIS COULD JUST ALTERNATELY. YOU KNOW MARKET UP MORE FOR THESE PARTIES RATHER THAN REALLY PROVIDE THE CLARITY- THAT THE MARKET AND THE SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORT THAT'S ALREADY COMING IN HAS HAS PROVIDED. YEAH BUT I MEAN PLEASE RESPOND TO YEAH WHATEVER YOUR THOUGHTS ARE SURE I WILL MISS YOU GALLAGHER YOU KNOW I DIDN'T I DIDN'T FINISH THE ORDER OF THE COIF LIKE YOU DID- AND LAW SCHOOL BUT THAT YES I DID I RECOGNIZE THAT- YOU KNOW WE WANT TO TRY TO BE AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE- BUT I THINK. YOU KNOW THAT THE BASIC GOAL OF THIS BILL. YOU KNOW IS- HAS TRIED TO ENCOURAGE GOOD BEHAVIOR I MEAN. I THOUGHT THE SAME THING AND I ASKED THESE. ACTUAL REAL LIFE. SMALL BUSINESSES YOU KNOW- IT WOULD BE WHEN THE LANDLORD WANTS TO NEGOTIATE WITH YOU SO THAT THEY ONE HAVE A VACANCY SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE A- COMPLETE LOSS OF REVENUES BUT- I WAS. I WAS SURPRISED. AND EDUCATED- REALIZING THAT THE- A GOOD NUMBER YOU KNOW THIS IS SOME OF THE WOULD SAY YEAH YOU KNOW. OUR LANDLORD- GOOD NEGOTIATED WORK WITH US- YOU KNOW RECOGNIZING OUR HARDSHIPS. BUT I WAS REALLY SURPRISED I MEAN THERE. THERE THERE IS THERE WAS ONE SITE VISIT IN IN TORRANCE THAT I WENT TO WORK- THREE- SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AND IN THIS THE SAME- A COMMERCIAL- STRIP MALL WAS- YOU KNOW THE- TOLD ME THAT THEIR LANDLORD REFUSED TO GIVE THEM ANY BREAK AND SO. YOU KNOW I MEAN THIS IS IN THE CONTEXT OF. OF OF- YOU KNOW A LANDLORD FILING FOR A UNLAWFUL DETAINER. YOU KNOW TO MAKE THAT DECISION TO. TO HIRE THE LAWYER TO FILED THE MOTION. YOU KNOW TO- TWO TWO VICTOR TENANTS- I THINK A LOT HAPPENS BEFORE THAT I THINK WEEK IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME THAT A LOT. SHOULD HAPPEN BEFORE WE GET TO THAT POINT BUT THIS BILL IS JUST. PROVIDING THAT FURTHER INCENTIVE YOU KNOW JUST A LANDLORDS JUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU'VE TRIED TO ENGAGE IN THIS GOOD FAITH EFENSE. ARE IN GOOD FAITH THAT NEGOTIATION OTHERWISE. THE TENANT WOULD HAVE THIS AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE OF- THAT THE FAILURE TO DO WHAT I THINK WE ALL AGREE SHOULD BE DONE BY LANDLORDS ANYWAY. THANK YOU DISTRESS. I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU I THINK THAT FOR SOME OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES- AND FOR MANY OF OUR STAFF WHEN THEY WOULD CALL AND SAY WHAT WHY DO THEY WANT TO REJECT ME AND I CAN'T PAY THE RENT- TO TELL THEM WE TOOK CARE OF THE RENTERS I'M SORRY WE DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF THE COMMERCIAL LEASES I'M REALLY GLAD THAT YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR SOME OF THE BUSINESSES I KNOW THEY WISH THAT. THIS IT HAPPENED LAST YEAR BUT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE BRINGING IT NOW I THINK IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THE DETAILS THAT ARE BEING REQUESTED I KNOW YOU'RE WORKING ON THOSE AND YOU COULD TELL FROM THE COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE AND I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THAT TOO WE WANTED TO BE A GOOD BILL BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE THE PROTECTION FOR THOSE COMMERCIAL RENTERS THAT. UNFORTUNATELY ARE OR COULD HAVING TO CLOSE DOWN SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL THANK YOU I CERTAINLY WOULD TO YOU KNOW BE HONORED IF THE MAJORITY LEADER WOULD ADD HER NAME AS A CO AUTHOR I. I WOULD BE HONORED IF THE ARCHITECT OF THE AB THREE OH EIGHT WITH THAT AS A CO AUTHOR AND ANYONE OF YOU WOULD APPRECIATE YOU KNOW YES I WOULD APPRECIATE BEING NAMED AS ONE OF YOUR CO AUTHOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. RIGHT MR TO- RESEARCH OUT- I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR TACKLING THIS ISSUE I HAVE A LOT OF- RESTAURANTS IN MY TO STREAK AND- WHO HAVE COMPLAINED TO ME ABOUT THE SITUATION AND DEVASTATED BY THIS PANDEMIC OBVIOUSLY AND- YOU KNOW GRANTED THAT THE WORD GOOD FAITH IS SOMEWHAT NEBULOUS. WHEN IT COMES TO. THE INTERPRETATION OF IT BUT I THINK IF YOU COULD PUT SOME GUARDRAILS AROUND IT OR YOU KNOW FOR THE TO FIND OUT TERM. I THINK IT WOULD GO A LONG WAY AND- AND I THINK A LOT OF MIGHT MIGHT YOU KNOW CONSTITUENTS ACTUALLY HAVE. BEEN SHUT DOWN JOE WAS SHUT DOWN BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND I THINK THIS WILL WILL HELP THEM- YOU KNOW. QUITE A BIT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ALL WEEK WE KNOW THAT- YOUR DISTRICT HAS THE BEST CHINESE FOOD IN THE WHOLE WORLD AND SO. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE DON'T WE DON'T SHUT THEM DOWN. I THINK YOU'VE JUST LOST A VOTE. AND A CO AUTHOR SHIPMENT FURTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THANK YOU I DO WANT TO POINT OUT FOR THE COMMITTEE AND THEN FOR THE AUTHOR GOOD FAITH DOES HAVE. THE DEFINITION AND CONTACTS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE UC SEEWE'RE TALKING ABOUT LABOR LAW. COMMERCIAL PAPER. IT'S PRETTY WELL ESTABLISHED AND- I GUESS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY TRANSLATE HERE BUT NOT NECESSARILY WHICH IS WHY THE ANALYSIS ASKING FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFICITY OKAY.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR TIME AND THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. WITH MANY CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLING WITH THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF COVERED NINETEEN IT IS IMPORTANT THERE ARE STRONG PROTECTIONS TO PREVENT WELL INTENTIONED BUT MISINFORM CONSUMERS FROM FALLING TO WORSE FINANCIAL SITUATIONS. THERE IS CURRENTLY LITTLE TO NO REGULATION DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA. CURRENT LAW DOES NOT REFLECT THE CHANGING PRACTICES OF THIS INDUSTRY WHICH HAS MADE ENFORCEMENT MORE DIFFICULT. THIS LACK OF REGULATION HAS LED TO INCREASED PREDATORY BEHAVIOR BY SOME OF THE BAD ACTORS WITHIN THE DEBT SETTLEMENT INDUSTRY I ALSO WANNA SAY THERE ARE MANY DOESN'T COMPANIES WERE DOING VERY GOOD WORK FOR CONSUMERS. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY CAN CAN CONTINUE TO DO THAT BUT THIS BILLS AIMED AT PROVIDING SOME REGULATION ON THE BAD ACTORS TO ENSURE THAT OUR CONSUMERS- ARE ARE LOOKED AFTER AND CARED FOR NOT- FALL VICTIM TO PREDATORY BEHAVIOR. MOREOVER THE LACK OF REGULATION OF THIS RING THE STREET HAS RESULTED IN CONFUSION FRUSTRATED CUSTOMER SPENDING ADDITIONAL MONEY AND TIME. TRYING TO DEAL WITH UNANTICIPATED DEBT COLLECTION LAWSUITS. OF THEIR AND ROLL DEBTS. AB FORTINO FIVE WILL MODERNIZE CURRENT LAW TO BETTER REFLECT THE INDUSTRY'S PRACTICES AND IMPROVE REGULATION DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS. ONE IT WILL MAKE CLEAR THAT ALL THAT SOME OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING CALIFORNIA ARE COVERED BY CALIFORNIA LAW. TO IT PROHIBITS DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES FROM ENGAGING IN DECEPTIVE AND MISLEADING PRACTICES. THREE IT REQUIRES CRITICAL DISCLOSURES THAT WOULD ALLOW CONSUMERS TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR FINANCIAL OPTIONS AND LASTLY. IT PROVIDES CONSUMERS. I INJURE BY BAD ACTORS WITH REMEDIES. THERE IS NEED FOR LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO PROVIDE GUARDRAILS BUDGET SETTLEMENT INDUSTRY BEFORE CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF CONSUMERSWHO HAVE ALREADY OR CURRENTLY SUFFERING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC AND THIS RECESSION. THIS BILL IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE PROTECTIONS AND A SUPPLEMENT TO THE WORK OF THE DF PI. WITH THE STATUS OF THE PART IF HE ONLY HAS A BROAD MANDATE TO REGULATE CONSUMERS FOR THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS UNDER CALIFORNIA'S FINANCIAL LAWS INCLUDING THE REGULATION THAT SOME INDUSTRIES. AB FORTINO FIVE WILL SUPPLEMENT THE JFK'S PURVIEW OVER THAT SOME COMPANIES AND GIVES THE DEPARTMENT TIME TO GROW RESPONSIBLY WHILE PROVIDING CONSUMERS WITH MORE ROBUST PROTECTIONS THAT ARE URGENTLY NEEDED NOW. WE'VE HAD EXTENSIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND I PLAN TO CONTINUE THESE CONVERSATIONS. WE'VE BET ON MANY ZOOMS AND HAD MANY CALLS AND I I'M I'M VERY COMMITTED TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION ON THIS BILL. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION AND SUPPORTED BY NUMBER OF LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS AND CONSUMER ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT WITH ME TODAY ARE DESIREE WHEN OR IF FROM THE CONSUMER ADVOCACY PROJECT OF THE JUSTICE AND DIVERSITY CENTER. OF THE BAR ASSOCIATION OF SAN FRANCISCO.

NGUYEN WORTH AND DANIELLE KENDO KAISER. GO AHEAD IN EITHER ORDER. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING CHAIR VICE CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM LUXURY ONE FOURTH PEOPLE LIKE ME TWENTY FOR THE CONSUMER ADVOCACY PROJECTS THE TOPIC NUMBER THREE POINTER AT THE PARK AT LEAST A SEPARATIST CAL SACRAMENTO BUT PRACTICALLY BY A SETTLEMENT COMPANY INJECTED FONG CRISTINA CONSUMER AND QUIETER BUT THE GOLD NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT OF THE CONFLICT THAT PRESUMABLY BUT NOT ALWAYS ONE OF NOT LESS THAN WHAT IS OWED. AND THAT GOVERNMENT CAN OPERATE BY CONSUMER ENROLLMENT THAT WHICH IS TO HAVE A LOOK AT WHAT SHE DID NUMBER C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; INTO ACCOUNT&lt;/c&gt;</u> IN ORDER TO FIND THE RESULTANT SETTLEMENTS NOW TO SEIZE ELECTRONIC COMPANY THEN STOPPED PAYMENT ON THE PAYMENT DATE IN ORDER TO FORCE THE CREDITOR AND NEGOTIATE SETTLEMENT AT THE OUTSET OF THE PLAN AND ABOUT THE TERMS TO CONSUMERS CREDIT RATING IS A LARGE PART BECAUSE THE CONSUMER GOODS FROM CURRENT DEMOCRATS. AND EVENTUALLY TRY GOT STATIC. NOTHING THAT I AM DESCRIBING AVAILABLE TO THAT IT COMES. CONSUMERS CAN BE ALLOWED COMPILE TWENTY THREE. WHEN IT COMES CONSUMER THAT A MARKET. YOU'RE A LIKE THAT ARE LIMITATION IMPOSED ON CREDITOR WORKING WITH A DISTRICT NUMBERS. THAT SADDAM AND IS NOT IT. IN POINTS THAT. IT AFTER THE TRUE THOUGH CONSUMERS OPTION TO DEAL WITH TAX. BUT THE ONLY. THE ARE HAVING OPTION AT ALL. YOUR ABOUT WHAT THAT GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY IS. UNDER ISSUE. A GREAT EXAMPLE OF IS THE INCREASE OF CONNECTED IN WHEN LAW THAT FROM THE- I A RESULT OF. ADVERTISING YOUR GET A CATEGORY AGREED SHOULD NOT BE DOING THAT NOT FOR THE- BECAUSE I THINK INCOME TO COMPLY. OF THE COULD INTO AND I WOULD NOT BECAUSE- AND ALONG THINKING IT OVER I THINK THAT NINE. IT MIGHT THIS COMPANY COMES UP THE COST OF SENATE. SOME FOR GOING MEDICALLY OR FOOD IN ORDER TO STAY IN AND- GOT. PLAN IN. CURRENTLY ALL THAT CONNECTS A BY FOR RIGHT.

HELLO CONSUMER MORE. AND OPPORTUNITIES MAKE AN EXTRA CHOICE ABOUT MANAGING THEIR TAX. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR ITEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND THEN DANIELLE KIND OF CLOSER. YES GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS DANIEL KENDALL CARTER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION A STATEWIDE COALITION OF FORTY LEGAL SERVICE PROVIDERS I'D LIKE TO READ A BRIEF POINT STORY FROM BAY AREA LEGAL AID THE LARGEST LEGAL SERVICES PROVIDER IN THE BAY AREA. SHE STILL WORKS MULTIPLE LOW WAGE JOBS SHE STRUGGLE TO MAKE A MINIMUM CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS. AFTER SEARCHING FOR SOLUTIONS ONLINE SHE RECEIVED AN EMAIL THE SOLICITATION PROTEST SENTIMENT SERVICES. DURING THE INITIAL CALL A REPRESENTATIVE SAID THEY WOULD TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING WITH HER CREDITORS. AFTER MAKING PAYMENTS FOR ALMOST A YEAR TO CELIA WAS SUED FOR AN IN WORLD THAT. WHEN SHE CONTACTED THE DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANY SHE WAS TOLD SHE COULD SHE WOULD NOT THEY WOULD NOT HELP HER TO RESPOND TO THE LAWSUIT. UNLESS SHE INCREASED HER MONTHLY PAYMENT WHICH SHE COULD NOT AFFORD TO DO. AFTER CANCELING THE CONTRACT AND DESPITE HER CLASS. SHE NEVER RECEIVED AN ACCOUNTING OR A REFUND. SHE WAS LEFT WITH DELINQUENT THAT MULTIPLE COLLECTIONS LAWSUITS AND ULTIMATELY SHE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY. AB FORTINO FIVE WILL NOT BAN THAT SETTLEMENT AND IT WILL NOT RUN PIECE COMPANIES OUT OF CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS PROVED BY THE FACT THE DEBT SETTLEMENT SERVICES ARE STILL OFFERED IN THE FORTY THREE STATES THAT REGULATE THE INDUSTRY. THIS BILL DOES NOT CONFLICT WITH THE D. S. P. I.'S ABILITY TO REGULATE DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES. AND IN FACT THE D. F. P. I WILL BE ABLE TO ENFORCE FORTINO FIVE ITSELF. NOR DOES THE BILL OVER THIRTY COMPANIES ARE ALREADY COMPLY WITH THE FTC'S TELEMARKETING SALES ROLE. BECAUSE MANY MANY OF THE BILL'S REQUIREMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THAT WILL. AB FORTINO FIVE WILL GIVE CONSUMERS A CHANCE TO MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE IT REQUIRES A COOLING OFF PERIOD TO PREVENT FURTHER DAMAGE TO CREDIT AND IT ALLOWS THE CONSUMER TO DO MORE RESEARCH. AND A PROHIBITS MISLEADING ADVERTISING AND DECEPTIVE DEBT SETTLEMENT PRACTICES. IN CLOSING AB FORTINO FIVE ENCOURAGES MARC MARKETPLACE COMPETITION BY REQUIRING ALL COMPANIES OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA. CAN COMPLY BY THE SAME SET OF RULES. IT WILL ENSURE THAT THAT SETTLEMENT BECOMES A SAFER PRODUCT AND IT WILL PROVIDE REMEDIES FOR CONSUMERS INJURED BY BAD ACTORS. BANKS LENDERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE VIEWED AS SAFE BECAUSE THEY ARE WELL REGULATED. AS DEBT SETTLEMENT BECOMES MORE MAINSTREAM BETTER GUARDRAILS WILL ACTUALLY GIVE CONSUMERS BETTER OPTIONS TO MANAGE THEIR TAX. I RESPECTFULLY URGE HER EITHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

GOOD MORNING MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND- CHAIRMAN STONE- MY NAME IS COREY BUTCHER I AM THE VICE PRESIDENT OF CONSUMER DEBT RELIEF INITIATIVE. AS A CO AUTHOR OF THE UNIFORM DEBT MANAGEMENT SERVICES ACT- THERE'S BEEN ADOPTED BY MANY STATES I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A STRONG PROPONENT OF GOOD REGULATION AND OUR SPACE BUT AB FOURTEEN OH FIVE MISSES THE MARK. WE KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL HAS GOOD INTENTIONS BUT THE TRUTH IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS AN ETHICAL INDUSTRY. WITH NO SYSTEMATIC ISSUES TO BE ADDRESSED. THE CFPB'S TWENTY TWENTY REPORT SHOWS THAT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES ACCOUNT FOUR. POINT 003% OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS. THAT'S A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE TOTAL COMPLAINTS OUT OF OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE THOUSAND LAW LAST YEAR. AT FOURTEEN OH FIVE DOES NOT ENHANCE- PROTECTION FOR THE CONSUMERS FROM DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES. BUT IN RETURN WOULD HAVE GREAT CONSEQUENCES. THE ONLY WAY OUR INDUSTRY WORKS IS WE PROTECT AND ADVOCATE FOR CONSUMERS. AND WE ARE ONLY COMPENSATED IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL. THIS BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM THAT SIMPLY DOESN'T EXIST. FURTHERMORE AFTER A PANDEMIC HAS DEVASTATED THE ECONOMY. MANY CONSUMERS HAVE TAKEN ON CREDIT CARD DEBT ABOUT. MINORITY AND UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES WILL BE HIT THE HARDEST. IF THIS BILL PASSES THE WELL PEOPLE STILL HAVE ACCESS TO GET SOME. BUT. LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES WILL NOT. I ARE FROM THE STRUGGLING CONSUMER. NOT JUST ON. IT'S UNFAIR. FINALLY BILL WILL ELIMINATE OR SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS FOR DEBT SETTLEMENT PROVIDERS. IT WILL DRIVE MANY SMALL PROVIDERS FROM THE MARKET WHICH REDUCES CONSUMER CHOICE AND PROTECTION. AS AN INDUSTRY WE ADVOCATE FOR STRUGGLING CONSUMERS AND WE HAVE A TRACK RECORD TO PROVE IT. WE URGE A NO VOTE ON EIGHTEEN AB FOURTEEN O'CLOCK SO WE CAN CONTINUE PROVIDING VALUABLE. SERVICE CITIES CONSUMERS WHO NEED IT THE MOST. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO ASK. THANK YOU MARGARET CLANCY. MARKET QUESTION NUMBER HAPPY AMERICAN FAIR CREDIT COUNCIL THE TRADE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THEM THAT'S KIND OF AN INDUSTRY WE ARE POSTAVY FORTINO FIVE BETTERMENT OFFERS TO HELP FINANCIAL DISTRESS CONSUMERS IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE ANSWER SETTLED NEARLY HALF A BILLION DOLLARS FOR DEBT MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS TYPICALLY SAVING AND THIRTY FOUR CENTS ON THE DOLLAR INCLUDING FEES. THE SAVINGS ENABLE THEM TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET IN MANY CASES AVOID BANKRUPTCY SETTLEMENT IS GOVERNED BY A REGULATIONS ESTABLISHED BY THE OBAMA ERA FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AMONG OTHER THINGS THOSE REGULATIONS PROHIBIT PROVIDERS FROM COLLECTING ANY FEES UNTIL THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY NEGOTIATE WITH THE CREDITOR THE CONSUMER HAS ACCEPTED THAT NEGOTIATION AND THEN HAD MADE A PAYMENT TO THE CREDITOR ALSO UNDER THESE RULES THAT SETTLEMENT COMPANIES ARE PROHIBITED FROM TOUCHING OR CONTROLLING CONSUMER FUNDS. CONSUMERS CAN LEAVE THE PROGRAM AT ANY TIME AT NO ADDITIONAL COST IF HE IS NOT OPPOSED TO STATE OVERSIGHT LAST YEAR WE OFFER LANGUAGE THAT WOULD REQUIRE STATE LICENSING FOR THE INDUSTRY THIS YEAR HOWEVER WE QUESTION THE NEED FOR THE BILL AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THE DEPARTMENT FINANCIAL PROTECTION AND BASS WHICH CREATED AND GIVEN. AT THE TO REGULATE THAT SET THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET INCLUDED EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION FOR THIS NEW DOLLARS FOR THE FORTY AND THIS YEAR NINE POINT 19% A PAST IF THERE IS LEGISLATION WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS ARE PREPARING TRANSPARENCY AND SHARE HER GOAL MAKING SURE CONSUMERS UNDERSTAND HOW THAT WORKS HOWEVER AB FORTINO FIVE TO PAINT MULTIPLE ON WHAT WILL PROVISIONS FOR EXAMPLE THE BILL REQUIRES US TO REFUND CONSUMERS MONEY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF THEY CANCEL CONTRACT. AS STATED ABOVE WE NEVER TOUCH CONSUMER FUNDS THEREFORE THERE'S NOTHING PRESS THREE FOR THERE IS A REQUIREMENT TO DESCRIBE SPECIFIC TAX CONSEQUENCES BUT WE AREN'T LAWYERS OR ACCOUNTANTS THEREFORE WE CANNOT GIVE TAX ADVICE WE HAVE SHARED AMENDMENTS WITH THE AUTHOR TO ADDRESS THESE AND OTHER ISSUES WE'VE ALSO ADDED DISCLOSURES THAT ARE MORE CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE THAN THOSE CURRENTLY FOUND IN AB FORTINO FIVE.

IS RICHARD WELL I AM. I'D LIKE TO KNOW- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE EMAIL. TELLING ME THAT THIS IS GONNA HURT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AS SOMEBODY WHO IS ORGANIZED IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR MY ENTIRE LIFE I JUST. LIKE SOME CLARIFICATION- THE ECONOMIC JUSTICE FIRST IS THAT A GROUP IN EXISTENCE OF. OUTSIDE OF THIS INITIATIVE BECAUSE I SPENT SOME TIME TRYING TO FIND THEM AND ALL I FIND IS THAT THE- HEAD OF THAT WAS A FORMER. MARIBEL SO I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW MANY MEMBERS THAT GROUP HAS. AS FAR AS THE EQUAL JUSTICE- MEMBERS I THINK IT'S CALLED ACCORDING TO YOU THE ECONOMIC JUSTICE FIRST. YOU SUBMITTED A LETTER OPPOSITION FROM THEM- YES I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY WHAT THEIR MEMBER COUNTY IS- YOU KNOW I DO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE SUPPORTED US IN SUPPORT OF OUR GENDER- AND I WOULD I CAN GET BACK TO YOU WITH THE EXACT NUMBERS OF HOW MANY MEMBERS THEY HAVE YEAH THAT BE GREAT BECAUSE THEY DON'T APPEAR TO HAVE ANY. ONLINE PRESENCE OR PRESENCE BEYOND- THE GENTLEMAN WHO SIGNED THE LETTER I'M ALSO RESOURCE A COALITION OF SMALL RETAILERS LOOK AT ZACHARY. IS HE THE- ARIZONA GOP COMMUNITY. STAR I WOULD HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE IF HE IS WITH THE GOP IN ARIZONA- ONCE AGAIN IT IS A ANOTHER GROUP THAT HAS SUPPORTED OUR INITIATIVE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AT SEVERAL GROUPS THAT ARE SUPPORTING OUR INITIATIVE- SURE YOU KNOW TOWARDS WHAT WE STAND FOR THE SENATE CONSUMER DEBT RELIEF INITIATIVE SIR I'M JUST OFFENDED WHEN I CONTINUE TO GET LETTERS OF OPPOSITION FROM FAKE GROUPS. THAT ARE ESTABLISHED SIMPLY TO SUGGEST THAT MINORITY COMMUNITIES WOULD BE HURT BY ANY BILL THIS IS NOT THE FIRST- BUT I JUST WANT THIS TO BE NOTICED THAT I WILL RESEARCH THESE I LOOK FORWARD TO KNOW A YOUR EXPLANATION OF THESE GROUPS AND IN PERHAPS PERHAPS IN FUTURE WE CAN HAVE HONEST DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW THIS AFFECTS COMMUNITIES AND NOT BE SENT LETTERS FROM THE ARIZONA GOP COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR SUGGESTING THAT THEIR SUPPORT THEIR US SOMEHOW REPRESENTING SMALL BUSINESSES AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES WITHOUT I I'M SORRY I'M OF THIS BILL I'M JUST REALLY TIRED OF. THIS TYPE OF- THANK OPPOSITION THANK YOU YOUR MOTION IS THERE A SECOND. AND THE SECOND THANK YOU ALL RIGHT THIS ADDRESS. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I ALSO HAD A QUESTION FOR MR BUTCHER. IN YOUR COMMENTS YOU SAID THIS THIS PROPOSAL FOR DEBT SETTLEMENT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD PROVIDE DEBT SETTLEMENT. I'M SORRY THE DEBT SETTLEMENT WILL REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR THE RICH BUT NOT FOR THE POOR. AND YET IN THE ANALYSIS IT SAYS THAT THIS BILL IS MEANT TO ADDRESS THE ABUSIVE PRACTICES WITHIN THE DEBT SETTLEMENT INDUSTRY. I WANTED TO KNOW HOW IT IS THAT YOU FELT. THAT DEBT SETTLEMENT WOULD REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR THE RICH BUT NOT FOR THE POOR. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- SO OBVIOUSLY DEBT SETTLEMENT- HAS BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES AND DECADES I BET SOMEONE INDUSTRY ONE AND THEN IT YOU KNOW I DID SOME OF THE WRITERS- WITH PEOPLE THAT HAVE LARGER INCOME ARE LARGER BALLOTS IS. THERE TO DO WOULD BE TO GO HIRE AN ATTORNEY- INTAKE TURNINGS YOU KNOW ANYWHERE FROM THREE HUNDRED TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS AN HOUR AGO REPRESENTING TO THE CREDITORS- AND- LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES THEY DON'T HAVE THAT. THEY DON'T HAVE THAT OFFER- I WOULD WANT TO SAY WHEN YOU LISTEN TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WERE IN OPPOSITION IT WAS FIRMS OR- RELATED TO LEGAL SERVICES- WE- YOU KNOW. WHAT WHAT THAT THAT IS AN OPTION THAT IS AN EXPENSIVE OPTION. THAT UNFORTUNATELY IT CONSUMER GOODS AND FINANCIAL DISTRESS JUST DOESN'T HAVE THAT OPTION- WITH WITH THAT SETTLEMENT- WE CAN GET EVERYBODY WE HAVE. WE HAVE HIGH INCOME EARNERS ARE HIGH DEBT LOAD WE HAVE. ONE GENERAL LOWER DEBT LOAD I THINK THAT. THE MISCONCEPTION THAT THAT WAS PRESENTED EARLIER IS THAT WE YOU KNOW TARGET ELDERLY THAT'S NOT THE CASE THE AVERAGE CONSUMER THAT COMES INTO DEBT SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. IS FIFTY TWO YEARS OLD. ALSO IT SAYS YOU KNOW THAT THIS HURTS THEIR CREDIT. IT DOESN'T THAT THE AVERAGE CONSUMER THAT COMES INTO THIS PROGRAM ON AVERAGE IS A SIX TWENTY CREDIT SCORE. OR CREDIT HAS ALREADY BEEN HARD. AND SO I THINK THAT'S THERE'S A LOT OF MISCONCEPTIONS OUT THERE. ABOUT WHAT THAT SOMEONE PROVIDERS DO. BUT AS FAR AS THE ELIMINATING FOR THOSE STRUGGLING CONSUMERS THAT- ARE IN THE LOWER INCOME. BRACKET THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE LEGAL SERVICES OR THE ABILITY OR THE MONEY TO ACCESS. OF THESE ATTORNEYS- THAT COULD DO THAT SETTLEMENT FOR THEM. SO THEY HAVE TO COME TO A PROVIDER LIKE OURSELVES. THAT CAN CAN OFFER THE SERVICES- TO THOSE CONSUMERS. THEN FOR. THE THOSE WHO SERVE. OUR SERVICES FOR DEBT. SETTLEMENT TO AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO CANNOT AFFORD AN ATTORNEY. SO THAT WAS A QUESTION FOR ME. I'M SORRY FOR EITHER DANIEL BECAUSE WHO DESIREE NGUYEN NORTH. WHY HI YES. SO SETTLEMENT SERVICE AND MY EXPERIENCE I WHAT DO I WITH YOUR I LOW INCOME NOT THE BAY AREA AND IN MY EXPERIENCE PUBLIC SERVICES HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE TO ALL OF MY AMERICA- PRIMARILY LOW INCOME PRIMARILY ELDERLY PEOPLE- FOLKS WHO RECEIVE PROTECTED IN CALIFORNIA DOES WELL IT'S QUITE IN THE COMING TERM BUT PEOPLE WHO HAS. BEEN ACCEPTED INTO GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THANK YOU COULD YOU PLEASE YOUR- YES CALGARY WHEN LIFE BY THE ATTORNEY FOR THE CONSUMER ADVOCACY PROJECTS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE HAVING VOLUNTEERED WITH THE LEGAL AID FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS THAT IS DEBT SETTLEMENT SERVICES WERE AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO COULD NOT AFFORD AN ATTORNEY I ALSO WANTED TO COMMENT THAT I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM IS GLAD STEAM. AND THE WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR TO TRY TO MAKE THIS THE BEST BILL POSSIBLE AND IN THE END DOING EXACTLY AS IT PURPORTS TO DO AND THAT'S TO ADDRESS THE ABUSIVE PRACTICES WITHIN THE DEBT SETTLEMENT INDUSTRY I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR PRESENTING THIS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS WAS GALLAGHER. YEAH I THINK THE CONCERN HERE IS THAT THIS IS A SERVICE THAT IS HELPING A LOT OF PEOPLE I MEAN WE HAVE CERTAINLY A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE GONE INTO DEBT EVEN BEFORE CO THAT THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN DURING THIS PANDEMIC- NO BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING THAT'S TRANSPIRED- AND YEAH THIS IS AN INDUSTRY THAT. IS HELPING PEOPLE. IT'S NOT EASY TO BE CALLING CREDIT CARD COMPANIES DIFFERENT. GROUPS TO TRY AND RESOLVE DEBT SETTLEMENT SO WE HAVE SOMEONE OUT IN THE MARKET IS PROVIDING A SERVICE THAT. I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING DOES HELP A LOT OF CONSUMERS RIGHT ARE THE BAD ACTORS OF COURSE THERE ARE. THEY ARE IN ALMOST EVERY INDUSTRY- BUT LOOK I THINK HAT WHAT WHAT THE CONCERN IS THAT THIS MIGHT. HAMPER THE SERVICE BEING PROVIDED- TO CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA AND- NOW IT LOOKS CALIFORNIA BLACK CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IS NOT A FAKE GROUP- AND THEY OPPOSE THIS BILL FOR THAT VERY REASON- IS THAT THEY WANT TO SEE THAT THAT THE SERVICE IS NOT UNDULY HAMPERED- SO. I THINK. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE MAYBE. I MEAN HAVE YOU CONSIDERED PERHAPS TAKING OUT THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BECAUSE TO ME THAT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT OPENS THE DOOR TO. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS OVER THIS ONE REALLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS SAY HEY LOOK CONSUMERS SHOULD HAVE NOTICE- THAT'S THE BASIC PREMISE OF YOUR BILLS TO PROVIDE THIS NOTICE TO CONSUMERS SO THEY CAN MAKE DECISIONS- TOLD ME ABOUT THIS AND EVEN GET OUT OF THAT. THIS CONTRACT IF IT IF THEY DETERMINE THAT THESE. THINGS HAVE NOT BEEN MET. IS THAT RIGHT AND MAYBE YOU CAN RESPOND TO THAT BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO GO AT THIS IS CERTAINLY I THINK A GOOD THING. BUT IF PEOPLE KNOW HEY THERE'S GONNA BE PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION FOR. ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING THEY MIGHT WITHDRAW FROM. THE FIELD AND THAT PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED THAT. I THINK BY AND LARGE A LOT OF PEOPLE. FEEL LIKE IT'S A POSITIVE THING. HAPPY TO ADDRESS THOSE REMARKS. MR- SO THERE'S ANOTHER ARE DOT COM COMPANIES THAT ARE DOING GOOD WORK FOR CONSUMERS AND ESPECIALLY IN THE MIDST OF COVERED RECOVERY WE'D WE NEED THAT THERE ARE ALSO BAD ACTORS AND ARE LEGALLY CLINICS ARE SEEING AND FEELING AND HEARING IN DEALING WITH THOSE ALL THE TIME RIGHT I ALSO ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION'S POINT THAT- THERE'S BEEN VERY FEW COMPLAINTS TO CONSUMER NOT JUST FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. THERE'S LOW REPORTING BECAUSE THERE ACTUALLY ISN'T A SECTION FOR DEBT SETTLEMENT COMPLAINTS RIGHT AND SO I THINK IT'S VERY UNDER REPORTED IN TERMS OF REPORTS TO CFPB BUT WE'RE SEEING IT WITHIN OUR LEGAL AID CLINICS AND SO THE GOAL OF THIS BILLS TO TIGHTEN THE REGULATIONS AROUND THIS TO ENSURE THAT THE GOOD ACTORS ARE DOING THE GOOD WORK IN THE BAD ACTORS ARE BEING DEALT WITH ACCORDINGLY AND PART OF BEING DEALT WITH IS PROVIDING- APPEAR REYES TO THE CONSUMERS HAVE SOME ABILITY. TO BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH RECOURSE WHEN THEY NEEDED RIGHT AND YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE GUYS GETTING SET UP IT'S A THREE YEAR RUN WAY IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME FOR THEM THEY'RE DOING WITH LARGER POLICY ISSUES- WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE FBI AND THEIR PURVIEW OVER THE SPACE BUT ALSO FEEL LIKE THE PIER A GIVES US ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX TO DEAL WITH THOSE BAD ACTORS. I THINK ONE THING THE- GUYS THAT THE MORE THINGS. THERE'S ALSO A FEE SHIFTING PROVISION WITHIN THE PIER RIGHT SO IF THERE'S SOME SORT OF MERITLESS LAWSUITS THE FEES COME BACK ON THE CONSUMERS IF THEIR MERITLESS RIGHT SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF PROVISION THERE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT YOU RAISE. THAT I THINK DO PROVIDE THE KIND OF GUARD RAILS SO THAT WE WON'T HAVE THE SORT OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT'S WHERE I WAS GOING TO GO NOT TO COMMITTEE AMENDMENT TO YOUR TAKEN TODAY RIGHT YEP- AND I THINK THAT'S INTERESTING I THINK WE SHOULD APPLY THAT IN OTHER. AREAS AS WELL LIKE IF SOMEONE IS BRING IN A MERITLESS ACTION THAT THE ATTORNEYS FEES SHOULD. ALSO APPLY ON THE OTHER SIDE WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT MANY OTHER AREAS BUT I THINK THAT THAT THAT DOES HELP I THINK THAT DOES HELP THE SITUATION. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT ALSO I MEAN WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE ANOTHER BILLS IS MAKE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE THE ONE WHO ENFORCES WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW THE I. NOW RIGHT SO THERE'S WE HAVE A NEW REGULATORY AGENCY AROUND THIS BUT I THINK IT'S- YOU NOW THEY'RE STILL. GET THEIR SEA LEGS RIGHT AND I THINK WE'RE DEALING WITH- A SITUATION RIGHT NOW TODAY WE HAVE. MANY CONSUMERS LOW INCOME CONSUMERS DISBURSING CONSUMERS HAVE COLOR RIGHT WHO ARE DEALING WITH SOME OF THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THE BAD ACTORS WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GIVE THEM A TOOL AND WORKING WITH ARE LEGALLY. CLINICS WHO DO SERVE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. I KNOW YOU MAY I RESPOND AS- WELL. OKAY NOW. NO YOU MAY NOT. I KNOW THAT YOU. CARE ABOUT THAT THE QUESTION WAS ADDRESSED IN THE OUT APOLOGIZE NO WAS NOT. I KNOW THE AUTHOR DOES DO A LOT OF GOOD WORK WORKING WITH OPPOSITION SO I WILL PARTY SAID I JUST IF WE DON'T WORK THROUGH SOME OF THESE ISSUES BECAUSE I. AGAIN I DON'T WANT TO UNDULY HAMPER- A SERVICE THAT THAT MANY CONSUMERS TO FIND HELPFUL ABSOLUTELY AND WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS YOU KNOW I WORK ON THIS ISSUE LAST YEAR AS WELL AND ANOTHER BILL- MARGARET AND I ARE ON SPEED DIAL WITH EACH OTHER. WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO- BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT TO LOSE SIGHT OF THE OVERALL GOAL OF MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE PROTECTING YOU KNOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR CONSUMERS WHO. NEED THESE PROTECTIONS. FURTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. RIGHT CA NINETY SIX I DO APPRECIATE THE- YOUR BILL AND I'VE I THINK. THE RIGHT RIGHT OF ACTION IS VERY IMPORTANT HERE BECAUSE WHETHER C. TOURNEY GENERAL OR THE- THE NEW AGENCY THEY THEY'RE GONNA HAVE LIMITED BANDWIDTH AND THAT PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS WHAT GIVES AN AGGRIEVED PERSON IN THIS CASE. ACCESS TO JUSTICE OTHERWISE THEY CAN'T HAPPEN AND WE DID DO THE FEE SHIFTING HERE WHICH I AM. RETICENT TO DO IN MOST OF THESE CASES ESPECIALLY WITH LOW INCOME PEOPLE. BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO EASILY INTIMIDATED BY THE THREAT. OF HAVING TO POTENTIALLY PAY LEGAL FEES AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BRING A CASE UNDER THAT THREAT THAT IS A BAD ACTION IT IS. PROBABLY AN ILLEGAL ACTIONS AT LEAST UNETHICAL BUT WE KNOW THAT IT HAPPENS AND SO FEE SHIFTING IS ABOUT ACCESS TO JUSTICE THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN WE ARE CONSIDERING. THOSE PROVISIONS BUT I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'VE THAT YOU'VE DONE HERE AND THAT YOU'RE STANDING UP FOR CONSUMERS. AND WITH THAT YOU MAY CLOSE AM I APPRECIATED APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS THE POINTS THAT ARE MADE ON THE DíAS THE QUESTIONS AROUND THE PUREE- GONZALEZ IS AN MISS RACES POINTS AS WELL. ALSO JUST CLOSE AND SAY THAT FORTY THREE STATES OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA REGULATE THAT SALMAN INDUSTRY NINE OF ACTUALLY BANNED THE PRACTICE COMPLETELY- SO OUR GOAL IS TO CREATE REGULATION HERE THAT HELPS CONSUMERS AND DEALS WITH ABOUT ACTORS BUT DOING SO IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY SO. WITHOUT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU. WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THAT MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. TO APPROPRIATIONS. CALDERON PLEASE STONE AYE STONE AYE GALLAGHER.
