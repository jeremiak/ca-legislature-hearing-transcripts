IS HERE. AND WE PROMISE TO LET HIM GO FIRST. YES HE ALWAYS GET SPECIAL TREATMENT [inaudible] AND YOU PROBABLY WOULD TOO IF YOU WERE IN HIS. WILL WE WILL WILL LEAVE THAT ALONE. ALL RIGHT SO WE ARE -- STARTING AS A SUB COMMITTEE WAS WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET. BUT WE WILL ALLOW -- YOU TO START -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER HERE. THANK YOU YOU WILL GO TO ITEM SEVENTEEN AB FIFTEEN FOURTEEN FIFTY FOUR AND THEN LATER I WILL ANNOUNCE. THE OTHER ITEMS AROUND ABOUT OUR AGENDA SO GO AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS FOR THE ASSEMBLY FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK FIRST. OUR AB FOURTEEN FIFTY FOUR CLARIFIES CHANGES TO THE YOUTH REINVESTMENT GRANT PROGRAM THAT WE AS AS LEGISLATURE FUNDED IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR FOR A TOTAL OF FIFTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION. VIEWS REINVESTMENT GRANT PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY MINISTERED BY THE BOARD OF STATE AND COMMUNITY CORRECTIONS WHO DISTRIBUTES GRANTS TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND INDIAN TRIBES. TO IMPLEMENT TRAUMA INFORMED DIVERSION PROGRAM FOR MINORS. DURING HIS FIRST YEAR OF APPLICATIONS MY OFFICE SOLICITED FEEDBACK AND FOUND THAT INCREASED FLEXIBILITY WAS NEEDED FOR JURISDICTIONS WHERE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAS LEFT HAVE LESS CAPACITY TO APPLY FOR FUNDS AND TO INCENTIVIZE ADDITIONAL PARTICIPATION. WORST CASE IS A GRANT PROGRAM TO CREATES WINNERS AND LOSERS ALL JURISDICTIONS HAVE I PROMISE YOU IN NEED OF CONNECTION TO SERVICES. THIS BILL HELPS ADDRESS THAT. THIS BILL INCLUDES A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL FIT BECAUSE WHICH MAKES IT EASIER FOR JURISDICTIONS AND NONPROFIT ENTITIES TO APPLY FOR GRANTS INSURERS THAT THESE FUNDS ARE USED FOR SUCCESSFUL DIVERSION PROGRAMS. FOR EXAMPLE THIS BILL ALLOWS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION TO APPLY FOR GRANTS DO YOU THREE INVESTMENT GRANT PROGRAM INCREASES THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF TWO TWO MILLION DOLLARS. NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT TO ME THAT MAKING SURE WE CAN IN THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE MAKE SURE THAT THESE FUNDS ARE PUT IN THE HANDS OF PEOPLE DOING THE HARD WORK OF DISMANTLING THAT PIPELINE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY IS DAPHNA. CAN. BECAUSE ON WHOA WITH THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH AND LAW. YOU MAY PROCEED. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS DOCTOR DESIGNING I AM A POLICY ATTORNEY AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW. I'M HERE TO EXPLAIN SOME OF THE IMPORTANT TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO THE U. THREE INVESTMENT GRANT WITH THE GOAL OF ENSURING THAT THE INTENT OF THE LAW. IS PROPERLY IMPLEMENTED. THESE AMENDMENTS ARE THE PRODUCT OF A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WITH THE A CC WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND ALSO WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHO PROVIDED US WITH VALUABLE FEEDBACK AFTER THE FIRST ROUND OF APPLICATIONS THE THREE BEST A GREAT. IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS THREE THEMES CAME ACROSS. FIRST BECAUSE THE INITIAL ROUND OF GRANT FUNDING ONLY ALLOWED A CITY OR COUNTY TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION. NUMEROUS GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND WE BASED ORGANIZATIONS WERE UNABLE TO ACCESS FUNDING. EITHER DUE TO A LACK OF POLITICAL WILL OR COMPLICATED APPROVAL PART BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY COULD NOT BE COMPLETED DURING A GRANT TIME. THE AMENDMENT REMAINING COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES TO APPLY DIRECTLY WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS AND FURTHERS THE ORIGINAL INTENT. OF SERVING YOUTH IN THE COMMUNITY AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO REST INCARCERATION. SECOND THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION PLACE TO CAP A ONE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH DISSUADED SOME OF THAT LARGER COUNTIES FROM BEING pWOULDN'T MEET THE NEEDS. FOR THEIR COUNTY. WE HAVEN'T AT FORMULATED AMENDMENT TO RAISE IT TO TWO MILLION DOLLARS AS MAX AMOUNT FOR THE GRANT. FINALLY WHILE FIFTY APPLICANTS REPRESENTING CITIES AND COUNTIES FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES ACROSS THE STATE APPLIED FOR THESE FUNDS THERE WERE GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES. PROVIDING INFORMATION FORMS TO ENCOURAGE APPLICATIONS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AS WAS DONE SUCCESSFULLY LAST YEAR IN SACRAMENTO AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO THESE FUNDS AND WE NEED TO WHERE THEY NEED FOR DIVERSION PROGRAMMING STILL REMAINS HIGH. WE KNOW THESE PROGRAMS WILL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF YOUTH WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT. MAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND WILL IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY. WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO ENSURING CHILDREN AND YOUTH. ARE PROVIDED COMMUNITY AND HEALTH BASED INTERVENTIONS IN LIEU OF ARREST AND INCARCERATION. THANK YOU TO EVERY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING BRIANNA'S LIFE ALERT NATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUTH LAW IN TRANSPORT. ANY OTHERS ALRIGHT ANY WRITTEN OPPOSITION.

ASSEMBLYMEMBER YOU'RE BRINGING THE BILL I I THINK THE SEC. IS -- WELL INTENTIONED BUT WE'VE HAD EXPERIENCES BEFORE WHERE -- OF FUNDS THAT WERE ALLOCATED DID NOT GET OUT BECAUSE OF EITHER THE WAY THE R. F. P. WAS WRITTEN OR OTHER -- OBSTACLES THAT OCCURRED SO THAT THE POPULATIONS AND ENTITIES THAT WE WERE INTENDING TO FIND MAYBE OUR OWN STATUTES WERE CLEAR ENOUGH. DID NOT GET THE FUNDING THAT WE HAD APPROPRIATED SO -- I THINK YOUR YOUR CORRECTIONS ARE THE YOUR THESE AMENDMENTS AND CORRECTIONS ARE NECESSARY. THE THING ABOUT THE RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS -- OBVIOUSLY YOU'LL GET BACK TO MY AND VICE CHAIR BUT ALSO I'M SURE WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY -- TO THE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THE RESEARCH AT A FUTURE TIME SO WE CAN FUTURE APPROPRIATE IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE HONEST STATUTES SO IT THIS DOES NOT. PRE VENICE IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE THE FINDING. IN WITHIN THIS ALLOCATION THAT'S ALL. ALRIGHT LET'S SEE IF THERE'S A MOTION MRS -- AB FIFTH FOURTEEN FIFTY FOUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER ADVENTURE YES JUST LIKE I COULD ASK ONE CERTAINLY QUITE YET. IT IS PAGE NINE AND IS FOR C.

DEFINITELY MAKE SURE IT IS A INDEPENDENT OUTSIDE AGENCY LOOKING AT IT NOT. AS YOU WOULD SAY -- GREAT ME LOOKING AT MY OWN PROGRAM. GOING ON THEN I'LL JUST HOLD OFF UNTIL I SEE IT ON THE FLOOR. RIGHT SO WE HAVE A SIMILAR WHICH I LIKE TO ASK RELIABLE. ALL RIGHTS LET'S -- TAKE A ROLL CALL AND THIS IS A DO YOU PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE MOORLACH. BRADFORD. JACKSON JACKSON AYE MITCHELL MORALE. WIENER. RIGHT THERE ARE [inaudible] THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU. SORRY IT'S NOT OUT USE ME THE BILL STILL ON CALL BECAUSE WE HAVE MISSED MEMBERS. AT LEAST TWO MISSING MEMBERS. SO APOLOGIES -- IT'S EARLY -- BEFORE WE GET TO OUR NEXT AUTHOR WHO WILL BE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN LET ME INDICATE THAT. AB THIRTEEN SEVENTY TWO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON IS BEING PULLED FROM TODAY'S HEARING IT WILL BE A TO YOUR BILL. THE BILLS ON CONSENT OUR ITEM TO AB THREE THREE TWO ASSEMBLY MEMBER LACKEY ITEM NINE AB EIGHT NINETEEN MARK STONE. ITEM TWELVE AB THREE THIRTEEN CAN ASSEMBLY MEMBER RADIUS AND WE'RE GONNA WAIT BEFORE WE DO A CONSENT MOTION BECAUSE WE HAVE. TO GET POSSESSION OF AB EIGHT NINETEEN AFTER IT WAS HEARD IN HUMAN SERVICES YESTERDAY IT HASN'T BEEN PASSED ON TO US YET UNTIL IT'S IN OUR POSSESSION. WE CAN'T ACT ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR THE SOONEST WE HAVE IT I WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION FOR CONSENT CALENDAR. ALRIGHT SO NOW WE'LL GO TO ITEM THREE AB THREE FORTY ASSEMBLY MEMBER IRWIN YOU HAVE TO FLOOR THANK YOU CHAIR SKINNER I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB THREE FORTY AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO KEEPING GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO SHOULD NOT HAVE THEM. SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX THE DOJ HAS MAINTAINED THE ARMED AND PROHIBITED POSSESSOR OF PERSON SYSTEM APPS AN AUTOMATED DATABASE THAT CROSS REFERENCES GUN REGISTRATION DATA WITH THE LIST OF PROHIBITED PERSONS. A BACKLOG OF APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND POTENTIALLY ARMED INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE APP SYSTEM UNDERLINES THE NEED FOR A NEW APPROACH. IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET -- THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATED THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO FUND APPS AND WANT TO THANK CHAIR SKINNER FOR THAT -- THIS IS TO FOR A LOCAL -- PILOT PROGRAM FOR THE COUNTIES OF ALAMEDA SAN DIEGO SANTA CRUZ AND VENTURA. AB THREE FORTY WOULD ENABLE THESE COUNTIES TO ESTABLISH ABSENT FORSMAN TEAMS CONSISTING OF AGENTS AND OFFICERS. FROM SHERIFF'S AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS WITH A REPRESENTATION FROM THE DA'S OFFICE AND STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES ROBUST DATA COLLECTION AND THAT A REPORT BE SUBMITTED TO THE LEGISLATURE SO WE CAN LEARN WHAT WORKS WHAT CAN BE APPROVED IMPROVED AND HOW TO BETTER FOSTER COLLABORATION BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS. WHEN YOU HAVE WITNESSES ALL. CORRECT. OKAY. AMANDA WILCOX ON BEHALF OF BRADY CALIFORNIA NINETY TWO CANS COME BY ONCE -- WE HAVE BEEN LONG TIME SUPPORTERS OF CALIFORNIA'S ARMED PROHIBIT A PERSON SYSTEM PROGRAM -- OBVIOUSLY TO THE EXTENT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE PROHIBITED AND PRESUMABLY DANGEROUS ARE -- THE FIREARMS REMOVED FROM THEM THE IT ENHANCES PUBLIC SAFETY WHEN THIS PROGRAM WAS INITIALLY CONCEIVED THE IDEA WAS THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD BE. GREATLY INVOLVED IN DISARMING PROHIBITED PEOPLE IN FACT ONE OF THE EARLY PROJECTS FOR CALIFORNIA BRADY CHAPTERS WAS TO REACH OUT TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY SIGNED UP FOR WHAT WAS AN COMMON APPS SECURE MAILBOX WHEREBY THEY RECEIVED A PRINT OUT EVERY MONTH I BELIEVE FROM THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT JUSTICE. OF FOOD ARMED AND PROHIBITED IN THEIR JURISDICTION. MANY AGENCIES THAT EVEN SIGN UP FOR THAT MAILBOX AND OBVIOUSLY I THINK AS WE ALL KNOW -- MOST OF THAT DISARMING OF INDIVIDUALS IN APPS HAS BEEN BY DONE AND DONE BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT JUSTICE. SO DID NOT HAPPEN AS PLANNED THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVEMENT MEANWHILE IN THESE YEARS -- WE'VE ADDED TO THE APPS BACK LOAD. OUR STATE NOW RETAINS RECORDS OF WHO HAS PURCHASE LONG GUN. MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE MAY FALL ON THE APPS WE HAVE RECORDS NOW FOO HAS REGISTERED THERE ARE SO CALLED FULL OF BUTTON ASSAULT WEAPON OR THE GHOST GUN THE GUN THAT THEY MANUFACTURED AND ASSEMBLED. THE END GUN SALES WERE VERY HIGH VERTICALLY BETWEEN THE YEARS OF WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA SELECTED AND PRESIDENT TRUMP -- SO OBVIOUSLY THE WORKLOAD HAS INCREASED OUR TO DISARM PEOPLE IN APPS THE NUMBER KEEPS RISING IT'S BEEN A GREAT FRUSTRATION I KNOW TO MANY OF YOU -- AND OTHERS IN THE STATE ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT IN THE MOST RECENT SB ONE FORTY REPORT SUBMITTED BY THE DEPARTMENT JUSTICE IS THAT LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ONCE AGAIN -- HELP WITH DISARMING PEOPLE WHO ARE PROHIBITED IN THEIR JURISDICTION -- IN DOING A PILOT PROGRAM IN THESE FOUR COUNTIES I THINK IS A GOOD WAY TO GO TO SEE HOW THIS WORKS TO LEARN FROM IT ESTABLISH. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PROCESSES FOR OTHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD APPROACH FOR BRINGING DOWN THAT APP. BACKLOG I HOPE IT WORKS AND IT CAN BE A MODEL FOR OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE. SO WE DRIVE OUT. FIGHT TO HAVE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MICHAEL PIMENTEL HERE BEHALF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI IN SUPPORT ESCRIBIR THANK YOU. GIVE ME MATHIS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING ELIZABETH ESPINOSA ON BEHALF OF THE VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND SUPPORT. ONE MAN CHAIR MEMBERS RANCHER WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT ANY OTHERS. ALL RIGHT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SINGMAN. LOVELY WAY TO START THE DAY -- CENTER MORE LACK. WILK MANAGER BECAUSE IT IS AMANDA WILCOX THAT WAS THE KEY WITNESS ALL A MOVIE ITEM GOOD -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. OKAY. THE I KNOW THAT -- THERE WERE SOME FUNDING. FOR THIS PROGRAM APPROPRIATE IN THE BUDGET WHICH IS GOOD. AND WITH THAT WILL TAKE A ROLL CALL THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS. SKINNER HI SKINNER AYE MOORLACH. WELL LIKE I BRADFORD JACKSON. MITCHELL MORALE. WIENER. AND YOUR BILL WILL BE ON CALL -- BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME MISSING MEMBERS. THANKS. OKAY IT WILL NOW GO TO ITEM FOR A. B. THREE NINETY SEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS SO I LIKE TO START OFF BY ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS -- WORKED OUT WITH THE COMMITTEE TO NARROW THIS SCOPE OF THE BILL TO CAPTURE DATA UPON CONVICTION FOR WHEN THE DO YOU I WAS COST SOLELY BY MAYOR AND WE WANNA. IN A WHEN I THINK THE CHAIR AND HER STAFF TEAM FOR BEING A PART OF THE PROCESS. ARE AB THREE NINETY SEVEN WILL REQUIRE THE ANNUAL REPORTING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OF OUR CONVICTION DATA RELATING TO DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANNABIS. OTHER STATES THAT LEGALIZED CANNABIS SAW INCREASES IN FATAL CRASHES INVOLVING INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANNABIS. THE LEGALIZATION OF CANNABIS IN CALIFORNIA WILL LIKELY CONTRIBUTE TO THE RISE OF IMPAIRED DRIVING AS WELL. WHILE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE INDEPENDENTLY KEEP STATISTICS ON CANNABIS RELATED TO YOU AYE DATA. OUR STATE HAS NO UNIFORM MECHANISM IN PLACE TO EVALUATE CANNABIS TRUCK DRIVING DATA. R. A. B. THREE NINETY SEVEN WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO HAVE ACCURATE AND RELIABLE DATA OF HOW MANY CANNABIS DO YOU AYE RELATED CONVICTIONS. OCCUR IN THE STATE TO ANNUALLY ADDITIONALLY THE BILL WILL ALSO MAKE A TECHNICAL CLEAN UP CHANGES. TO CORRECT SOME -- CROSS REFERENCES IN VEHICLE CODE. SO WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A PRIVATE. THANK YOU -- DO WE HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. TIFFANY MATTHEWS ON HALF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT OTHERS. ALL RIGHT DO WE HAVE ANY -- WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS LUCIA MUCH LIKE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSOCIATION OF RECORDS SUPERVISORS -- WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL AS IT WAS AT BRITAIN HOWEVER ON SINCE THE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE AUTHOR WE'RE HAPPY TO REVIEW THE BILL AGAIN. AND I SEE IF WE CAN REMOVE OPPOSITION TO LEGISLATION THANK YOU OKAY. ANY ONE ELSE WINNERS OPPOSITION. OKAY -- YES HERE'S ANOTHER. JANUARY TEARS ONLY HAVE A CALIFORNIA ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN OPPOSITION RIGHT. THAT RIGHT AND LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANY -- MY AFTER WE HAVE COME INTO QUESTION MOVE THE BILL. OKAY -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR AND TAKING YOU MANAGE I KNOW THAT. OUR HIGHWAY PATROL AND MANY OTHER AGENCIES ARE VERY EAGER FOR US TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE WE HAVE A VALID -- CAST AT THE POINT OF ARE ANY OFFICER. PULLING OVER SOMEONE WHO IS -- DRIVING THEN THEY FEEL IMPAIRED. SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME DETERMINATION. OF IF THEY'RE UNDER THE INFLUENCE AND IF AND WHAT THEY'RE UNDER THE INFLUENCE. THE DIFFICULTY WITH CANNABIS IS THAT T. H. C. WILL STAND SOMEONE'S BLOOD SYSTEM. FOR A GOOD PERIOD OF TIME SO THEY COULD HAVE A UTILIZED CANNABIS A DAY EARLIER TWO DAYS EARLIER -- AND BE. PERHAPS BE IMPAIRED FOR ANOTHER REASON AND YET IT MIGHT SHOW CANNABIS WITH OUR CURRENT TESTING SO I THINK THAT THE AMENDMENT YOU'VE TAKEN IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WILL GIVE US MORE ACCURATE INFORMATION BECAUSE WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW. WHETHER THAT IMPAIRMENT IS SOLELY CANNABIS ARE PRIMARILY CANNABIS OR IN A DIFFERENT DRUG SO THAT GIVES US THE INFORMATION AS TO WHETHER OUR THE NOT OUR BUT THE FACT OF LEGALIZATION. IF IT IS CONTRIBUTING TO MORE -- IMPAIR DRIVING INCIDENTS -- CERTAINLY OTHER STATES DATA WOULD INDICATE THAT IS SO AND I THINK THAT'S WHY YOUR MOTIVATION OF YOUR BILL IS TAKE NAY BLESSED TO GET THAT DATA BUT I THINK THIS AMENDMENT IS A IS A GOOD. CORRECTION I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING IT ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR MAKING THAT SUGGESTION AS WELL CERTAINLY AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I ASKED HER ADULT. EXCELLENT SO NOW -- THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS WILL DO A ROLL CALL. SKINNER AYE SKINNER AYE MOORLACH. WELL LIKE I BRADFORD. JACKSON MITCHELL MORALE WIENER. YOUR BILL WILL BE ON CALL BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME MISSING MEMBERS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER MY ALL RIGHT LET'S SEE WHO'S HERE. OKAY GET A TEAM OF BREAKFAST WHAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO WE WILL ALLOW YOU TO PRESENT IT IS ITEM? FIVE EIGHTY FIVE SIXTEEN GO AHEAD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR HEARD THERE WAS AN OPENING HAPPY TO TAKE IT -- FIRST OF ALL YOU WERE NEXT. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION OF AB FIVE SIXTEEN A BILL THAT WOULD REFORM A FEW TELLING PRACTICES THAT ARE SEVERELY IMPACTED LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. LET ME FIRST START BY -- PROVIDED A SIGNIFICANT THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF YOUR WORK WITH THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE. AND OUR OFFICE ON VERY SIGNIFICANT MOMENTS WE'VE TAKEN IN THE SENATE. FOR MY PRESENTATION ALI WILL BRIEFLY DESCRIBE WATER BILL SEEKS TO DO WATER BILL DOES NOT DO -- AND SUMMARIZE ARMAMENTS FOR SORT OF BUILD US. EARLIER THIS YEAR A STATEWIDE STUDY ENTITLED TOWED INTO DEBT EXTENSIVELY DOCUMENTED THE IMPACT OF THREE TOWING GROUNDS REFER TO AS PARTY TO US. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR FIVE PARKING TICKETS AND OUTDATED CAR REGISTRATION FOR A PRIVATE PARKING SPOT -- SINCE OVER ALMOST HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIANS DON'T HAVE A SPARE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS FAR LESS THAN THE AVERAGE COST TO GET YOUR CAR OUT OF A TOW YARD. GETTING TOWED EQUALS ASSET FORFEITURE YOU LOSE YOUR CAR YOUR ABILITY TO GET YOUR JOB. MANY INSTANCES YOUR JOB YOU'RE ONLY ECONOMIC ASSET FOR YOUR ONLY FORM OF SHELTER. THESE TOES HAVE ACCELERATED POVERTY AND HOMELESSNESS. IT TURNS OUT THE TO YOUR ALSO LOSE MONEY ON THESE PROVISIONS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO STORE CARS BEFORE AUCTION SALES. AND THE AVERAGE STORAGE IN THE IN AN AUCTION SO CASA FAR EXCEED THE AVERAGE SALES PRICE OF A CAR. FOR SIMILAR REASONS CITIES RUNNING THESE TOWING PROGRAMS ALSO LOSE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THIS IS WHY WE ORIGINALLY PROPOSED ELIMINATING THESE PROVISIONS TO END A CYCLE OF POVERTY NOT WORKING FOR WORKING FAMILIES TÃ´I YARDS OR CITIES. NOW I WANT TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT OUR BILL DOES NOT DO BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MISINFORMATION ABOUT IT. FIRST THERE BEEN SOME ADVOCATES FOR CITIES TO SUGGEST THAT THIS BILL AND STOWING THAT IS FALSE THRE ARE OVER THIRTY GROUNDS TO TOW CARS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. MOST HAVE TO DO WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AND TRAFFIC FLOW WE'RE NOT TOUCHING ANY OF THOSE. SECOND SOME CITIES HAVE SAID WILL ALLOW ABANDONED CARS ON THE STREETS THAT IS ALSO FALSE THERE'S A SPECIFIC TOWING PROVISION THAT ALLOWS CITIES TO TOW CARS THAT ARE BANNED IN WRECKED OR INOPERATIVE. WE'RE NOT TOUCHING THAT. THIS COMMITTEE MAY HAVE ALSO HEARD THE SUGGESTION THAT WERE SOMEHOW REMOVING LOCAL CONTROL AND THAT IS ALSO FALSE THERE IS YET ANOTHER TIME PROVISION. THAT WE'RE NOT TOUCHING WITH THIS BILL THAT ALLOWS THE CITY TO PASS LOCAL TOWING LAWS TO ADDRESS LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS IS A BILL THAT SUPPORTS PURE LOCAL CONTROL. NOW JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO DISCUSS THE SIGNIFICANT MOMENTS WE TOOK THE ORIGINAL BILL VOTED ON BY THE ASSEMBLY WOULD HAVE DELETED THE THREE POVERTY TOWING GROUNDS UNDER STATE LAW. AFTER NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS WITH THIS COMMITTEE AND THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE WE AMENDED OUR BILL TO ONLY DELETE ONE OF THE THREE TELLING GROUNDS. THE AMENDED VERSION OF THIS BILL WILL ALLOW CITIES TO CONTINUE TO TOW FOR EXPIRED REGISTRATIONS. THE AMENDED VERSION OF THIS BILL WILL ALSO ALLOW CITIES TO CONTINUE -- TO TO CARS THAT HAVE BEEN LEGALLY PARKED ON PUBLIC STREETS. CURRENT LAW SAYS CARS CAN BE TOWED AFTER SEVENTY TWO HOURS WITHOUT NOTICE. SINCE MANY CITIES TOLD US THAT THEY DON'T TELL UNDER THIS OFFER AT LEAST A WEEK OR LONGER. AND SUPPORT PROVIDING NOTICE TO CAR OWNERS ARMAMENTS WOULD ALLOW A CAR TO BE TOWED IMMEDIATELY AFTER A NOTICE AND FIVE BUSINESS DAYS. OR BILL DOES MOVE TO AND TOWING FOR UNPAID PARKING TICKETS WHICH IS THE PUREST VERSION OF TELLING SOMEONE TO COLLECT A MINOR DEBT. I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT OUR BILL DOES NOT MAKE IT LEGAL TO NOT PAY PARKING TICKETS. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN CONTINUE TO LOSE USED AT LEAST EIGHT OTHER ALTERNATIVE REMEDIES TO COLLECT UNPAID DEBTS. LESSON ONE A NOTE FOR THIS COMMITTEE THAT THERE ARE STRONG CONSTITUTION ARGUMENTS THAT TELLING SOMEONE TO CLICK TO MINOR DEBT VIOLATES THE FOURTH AMENDMENT'S PROHIBITION. AGAINST SEIZURES OF PROPERTY THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT'S PROHIBITION AGAINST EXCESSIVE FINES. AND THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT'S PROHIBITIONS AGAINST DEPRIVING DUE PROCESS AND EQUAL PROTECTION WITH UP WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO A WITNESSES. YOU MAY PROCEED. I AM GRAHAM ACLU OF CALIFORNIA AS A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. AS THE REPORT HIGHLIGHTS THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS LOSE THEIR CARS EVERY YEAR AS A RESULT OF POVERTY TOES THIS IS THEIR LIFELINE TO TRAVEL TO WORK GET TO SCHOOL OBTAIN HOUSING TAKE THEIR FAMILY TO THE DOCTOR. WHEN CARS GET TOWED FOR UNPAID PARKING TICKETS A COSTS INITIALLY HUNDREDS TO GET YOUR CAR THE TO A LOT? AND THOUSANDS OFTEN BECAUSE LOW INCOME FOLKS NEED TIME TO GATHER THAT INITIAL MONEY BUT EVERY DAY THAT THEY SPEND TRYING TO COLLECT THOSE FUNDS ADDITIONAL STORAGE FEES GET TACKED ON TO THEIR FINAL BILL. AS A RESULT THE CARS OFTEN COST THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO GET OUT OF THE TOTAL YARDS LOW INCOME FAMILIES CAN'T AFFORD THAT THEY FORFEIT THEIR CARS. AND A CYCLE THAT BENEFITS NO ONE ENSUES THE CARS GET SOLD BY THE TOW YARD SET A LIEN SALE. THE MONEY FOR THE PARKING TICKET THAT NEVER GETS COLLECTED BY THE CITY AS THE TOW YARD TO KEEP THE LIEN SALE. SO THE INDIVIDUALS OUT A LIFELINE FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY AND THE ORIGINAL PARKING TICKET THAT GOES ON PAID. AND CARS WITH UNPAID PARKING TICKETS DON'T POSE A PUBLIC SAFETY THREAT THEY DON'T IMPEDE TRAFFIC LOW BUT THEY ARE UNFORTUNATELY EXTREMELY ESSENTIAL TO DAILY LIFE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S WHY WE BROUGHT THIS BILL SO THAT MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS DON'T CONTINUE TO BE TOWED INTO DEBT. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY CANNOT AFFORD THEIR PARKING TICKETS. NEXT WITNESS. MADAM CHAIR MY CAROL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE ARE ALSO A CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. AND THIS IS -- YOU KNOW FOR THE LAST FIVE OR SIX YEARS NOW OUR ORGANIZATION AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN BRINGING. OF LEGISLATION IN FRONT OF YOU THAT DEALS WITH THE HIGH COST OF BEING POOR -- AND SO WE'VE WE'VE WORKED ON TRAFFIC TICKETS WE WORKED ON BAIL WE'VE WORKED ON JUVENILE FINES AND FEES REPORT ON PARKING TICKETS. ALL OF THESE ARE EXAMPLES THAT WE SEE IN OUR LEGAL SERVICE PROGRAMS EVERY DAY WHERE PEOPLE ARE -- BEING SUBJECTED TO THE HIGH COST OF FINES AND FEES MAY SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD TO STAY UP WITH THE COST OF THESE AND IT GETS THEM INTO SERIOUS DEBT. AND IN THE IN THE SITUATION WITH -- OF PARKING AND TRAFFIC FEES ULTIMATELY OUR CLIENTS FREQUENTLY LOSE THEIR MAJOR ASSET THAT THEY HAVE THAT THEY DEPEND ON TO GET TO WORK TO BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY. PAY THE COST OF THESE FINES AND FEES. OUR GOAL IN BRINGING THESE BILLS IS THE TRIED TO SELF ESTABLISH A SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY ALLOWS PEOPLE TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THESE. THESE LAWS WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE -- TO GET THEIR CARS REGISTER WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM SMOG AND BE LEGAL ON THE STREETS. BUT THE WAY WE SET UP MANY OF OUR LAWS WE WE CREATEDECONOMIC IMPEDIMENTS TO THEIR ABILITY TO DO THAT SO WE SEE AB FIVE SIXTEEN AS THE LATEST THINKING IN A PATTERN OF CHANGES THAT WE'RE PROPOSING. THAT WILL ALLOW OUR CLIENTS TO DRIVE LEGALLY SAFELY M. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB FIVE SIXTEEN AND DRIVE VOTE TODAY. WE HAVE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT [inaudible] SENATOR SCANNER. Q..

A GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RUNNING PRETTY GOOD HERE -- ON BEHALF OF THE LEAVE CALIFORNIA CITIES -- UNFORTUNATELY DESPITE THE AMENDMENTS -- WE REMAIN STRONGLY OPPOSED -- TO AB -- FIVE ONE SIX IT DOES PREAMP CITIES -- FROM TOWING UNDER SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES -- WHEN YOU DELETE SECTIONS OF THE VEHICLE CODE -- THE VEHICLE CODE IS WHAT GIVES CITIES AND COUNTIES -- THE EXPRESSIVE FORTY THE TONER SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES THERE FOR WHEN THOSE PROVISIONS ARE DELETED. THE AUTHORITY GOES AWAY -- CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE SECTION -- TWENTY ONE BASICALLY THE INTRODUCTION TO THE TIRE VEHICLE CODE -- CLEARLY PREEMPTS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS -- FROM THIS FIELD OF LAW -- THEREFORE WHEN YOU DELETE THE SECTIONS AGAIN -- THE AUTHORITY -- GOES AWAY WITH THAT -- UNDER AB -- FIVE ONE SIX CITIES WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO TOW CARS -- IF THEY HAVE FIVE OR MORE MP PARKING TICKETS -- AND AND KEEP IN MIND WHEN SOMEBODY GETS FAR MORE UNPAID PARKING TICKETS -- CITIES ALSO HAVE TO BE AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY ONE DAYS FOR THOSE. FOLKS RESPOND -- AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT BECAUSE OF AB -- FIVE OH THREE BY SOMEONE MEMBER LACKEY WHICH WAS CHAPTER A JUST TWO YEARS AGO CITIES ARE LEGALLY REQUIRED. TO OFFER PAYMENT PLANS ANYBODY WHO'S AND DIGIT MEANING THAT THEY ARE ON SOME FORM OF CASH ASSISTANCE -- WITH THE STATE. AND SO -- WE DO THINK THAT THAT THERE ARE THAT THERE ARE REMEDIES -- FOR FOLKS WHO ARE LOW INCOME -- TO ENROLL INTO A PAYMENT PLAN AND BASICALLY -- BY THE TIME THAT THEY HAVE THEIR FIFTY TAKE IT THAT IS ON RESPONDED -- TO IT YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT COMPLYING OR EVEN DOING SOMETHING BASIC AS GOING DOWN THE CITY HALL -- AND RESPONDING TO THE VIOLATION OR ROLLING IN A PAYMENT PLAN -- AND WE THINK THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM -- THE OTHER THING ON THE SEVENTY TWO HOURS -- BASICALLY WE HAVE TO WAIT WE WOULD UNDER THIS BILL THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO WAIT AN ADDITIONAL FIVE BUSINESS DAYS -- TO LAPSE -- AFTER THE SENATOR OVER OUR VIOLATION HAS OCCURRED -- WITH THE SCIMITAR VIOLATION AS YOU ALL KNOW -- EVEN WHEN YOU LOOK AROUND YOUR CITY -- THOSE -- THAT PARTICULAR -- MUNICIPAL CODE IS TYPICALLY NOT SIGNED -- FOR SOME CITIES RECEIVED OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND COMPLAINTS FOR CARS BEING -- PART OF FOR TOO LONG WITHIN THEIR JURISDICTION -- AND SO WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE THE BANDWIDTH TO REALLY -- DEAL WITH ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS -- SO WE TYPICALLY DON'T DON'T NECESSARILY SIGN FOR THAT -- BUT CITIES DO TYPICALLY PLACE A NOTICE -- ON ON THE VEHICLES SAYING THAT YOU'RE GONNA ONCE WE WITNESS THE VIOLATION ESSENTIALLY A CAR BEING UNMOVED FOR SEVEN TWO HOURS -- WE JUST CAN'T TAKE A COUPLE YOU KNOW A COMPLAINTS WORK FOR IT -- WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO SEE THE SAME TO OURS THE LAPS THEN WE'LL THEN CITIES WILL TYPICALLY PLACE A NOTICE ON WHICH FIELD. THANK FROM TODAY YOU HAVE THINGS ARE SOME OF YOUR CAR IF YOU DON'T THEN THE CARD GETS TOWED. THIS WOULD ADD AN ADDITIONAL FIVE BUSINESS DAYS THROUGH THAT PROCESS WERE LOOKING AT A MINIMUM OF EIGHT EIGHT DAYS -- BEFORE PARKING CAN GET TOWED. CAN I DO THINK THAT THAT CREATES -- A PUBLIC SAFETY RISK -- IF NOW HOMELAND SECURITY MAYBE SOME DOMESTIC ISSUES -- I THINK COULD BE AT RISK -- THERE AS WELL -- AND SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS -- WE REMAIN OPPOSED [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO NOW WE CAN. JACKSON MAN TELL ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD WE HAVEN'T OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION AND HAVE SUBMITTED THOSE AMENDMENTS TO THE AUTHOR THANK YOU.

LET'S START WITH THAT -- LET ME SAY A FEW THINGS ABOUT THIS THERE'S BEEN. A LOT OF MISINFORMATION THAT'S BEEN PUT OUT IN THIS BILL I RARELY IN MY OPENING STATEMENT SORT OF LAY OUT WHAT THE MISINFORMATION IS -- BUT WE ARE NOT TRYING TO ELIMINATE. WE WERE TRYING TO GET AT A HANDFUL OF PROVISIONS OUT OF OVER THIRTY THAT ADDRESS TIME IN MY CITY THE THREE PROVISIONS WE WERE INITIALLY TALKING ABOUT WOULD HAVE TOLD ABOUT 10% MALTOSE. SO 90% OF ALL DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH PUBLIC SAFETY TRAFFIC FLOW WOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO CONTINUE WE HAVE NOW AMENDED. SERVER ONLY TALK ABOUT TOUCHING ONE OF THOSE -- THREE TO SO AGAIN PROBABLY A COUPLE OF PERCENTAGE OF AUTO SO MY GUESS IS 979698% OF AALTO'S WILL. CONTINUE TO BE ALLOWED WHAT WE ARE SAYING WITH THIS BILL AS IT'S BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY AMENDED WITH THE SUPPORT OF THIS COMMITTEE. IS THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO PAY FOR PART FIVE PARKING TICKETS. WE SHOULDN'T USE THE HAMMER VERTIGO TO GO OUT YOU LET ME LET ME TO DELINEATE THE EIGHT OTHER WAYS. THAT ALL OF OUR CITIES COULD GO AFTER INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NOT PAID THEIR PARKING TICKETS. YOU COULD CHARGE THEM LATE PAYMENT PENALTIES YOU COULD WITH A WHOLE TAX RETURNS YOU COULD PLACE REGISTRATION HOLDS YOU CAN SEND DEBTS TO COLLECTION AGENCIES. YOU CAN OBTAIN CIVIL JUDGMENTS YOU CAN LEVY BANK ACCOUNTS YOU CAN GARNISH WAGES YOU CAN PLACE PLANES. I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF A NUMBER OF MEMBERS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE THAT I SIT ON WHO HAVE SUPPORTED THIS BILL BECAUSE OF THE VERY STRONG CONSTITUTION ARGUMENTS. THAT TOWING VIOLATES THE FOURTH AMENDMENT THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT AS I DESCRIBED BEFORE. IT REALLY IS TRULY DISPROPORTIONAL. AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY THERE BEEN A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WERE PROPERLY TO CITIES SUCH AS SIMPLY ARE ARE NOT TRUE -- LET'S TAKE THE CHANGES WERE ASKING TO FOR THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR RULE THAT IS CURRENTLY ON THE STREETS RIGHT NOW THE RULES SAYS. SPEND THREE BIS THREE CALENDAR DAYS IS THE A PERIOD OF TIME. IN THE LEAGUE OF CITIES OWN OPPOSITION LETTER. WHAT THEY STATE IS -- THAT PEOPLE TYPICALLY MOVE THEIR VEHICLES WHEN THEY RECEIVE A NOTICE SO THE SUGGESTION IS. THERE THERE YOU KNOW NOTICES OKAY WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM CITIES. AND VEHICLES A. GET TONER OFTEN UNMOVED IN EXCESS OF SEVENTY TWO HOURS WHAT WE HEARD FROM MANY CITIES IS. CITY STILL WANT THE RIGHT TO DO THIS BUT THEY'RE OKAY WITH A SLIGHTLY LONGER PERIOD OF TIME AND WITHOUT NOTICE AND THAT'S WHAT OUR AMENDMENT DOES. PROVIDE TO NOTICE AND WE SAY RATHER THAN THREE CALENDAR DAYS FIVE BUSINESS DAYS SO -- AGAIN WE THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY MODEST CHANGE LONG TO REALLY ADDRESS -- SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN INTENSIFYING POVERTY INTENSIFYING THE HOMELESSNESS THAT WERE SEEN ON IN YOUR COUNTY AND MY COUNTY THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND AND WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO DO THIS AND AND A MEASURE. THANK YOU THANK YOU VENTURE. LAKE. FOREST. QUOTE I SOME DEMOCRATIC SHORT STORY ABOUT MY POKING EXPERIENCE. WHICH I DID NOT GET NOTICED ABOUT -- MY CARD BEEN MISSING FOR A MONTH IT WAS STOLEN I'D REPORTED IT BEING STOLEN. AND THEN ONE DAY I GET THIS -- TICKET I GET THE THING IN THE MAIL THAT I'M ROOM IN ARREARS FOR LATE PAYMENT OF A TICKET. I CALL AND SAY HEY YOU KNOW THIS IS STONE VEHICLE AND THEN THEY'RE LIKE YEAH WELL IT WAS TOWED NO MICHAEL YOU DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE MINUTES TOAD AND THEN I GO TO THE TOW YARD. NO ONE'S TOLD ME YET VEHICLES IN OFFERED TO IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE I GO TO THE TOW YARD THE TOW YARD SAYS WE CAN'T WAIT TO EVEN LOOK AT YOUR VEHICLE UNTIL YOU PAY THE TICKET. HI BUT THIS WAS A STORM VEHICLE THEN THEY'RE LIKE WELL YOU HAVE TO HAVE PROOF OF THAT AND OF COURSE ANYWAY SO. HELLO. DIDN'T GET THAT CAR ADDED THERE UNTIL WELL AFTER CHRISTMAS EVE BECAUSE OF COURSE THE TOW YARD CLOSED. AND THE CITY AND THE TOW YARD WE'RE STILL GOING TO EXPECT ME TO PAY FOR THE STORAGE OF THAT STOLEN VEHICLE. SO ANYWAY IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING EXPERIENCE -- US SUFFICE IT TO SAY I PROBABLY HAVE EVEN STRONGER CAM K&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt; SPENT ANYWAY -- BUT CERTAINLY WHAT I SAW IN GOING TO THE TOW YARD THE MULTIPLE TIMES I HAD. TO WHERE PEOPLE THAT LITERALLY WORK FULLY DEPENDENT ON THEIR CAR. FOR THEIR LIVELIHOODS AND WERE ALL OF A SUDDEN THAT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM AND FOR MANY OF THEM IT WAS FOR EXACTLY THE IT WAS EITHER A UNPAID REGISTRATION OR AN UNPAID -- TICKET AND AS WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE REGISTRATION UNLIKE MOST OTHER LARGE PAYMENTS THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT WE COULD DO IN INSTALLMENTS. VIEW COURT WE DON'T ALLOW THAT IN CALIFORNIA SO FINDING THAT -- INITIAL THAT. FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT BIG CHUNK OF MONEY WHETHER IT'S THREE HUNDRED BUCKS FIVE HUNDRED BUCKS WHATEVER THAT. IS VERY DIFFICULT SO SOMETIMES IT GETS DELAYED. AND INTO IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING EXPERIENCE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR BILL AND I KNOW YOU REFERENCED ARE COMMITTEE I DON'T KNOW IF WE WERE THE ONES WHO ASKED FOR ALL OF THOSE LIMITS BUT THAT'S OKAY IT WENT THROUGH TO COMMITTEES -- SO I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE MORE -- APART ALLOWED A FEW MORE OF YOUR CATEGORIES BUT WHATEVER -- WILL LEAVE IT -- IT WE'VE GOT A MOTION -- IT SAYS. DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS -- WE DON'T HAVE A MOTION APOLOGIES I EAT IT. WE HAVE A MOTION. SIR BRADFORD. POLITICIANS NOW WE'LL DO THE ROLL CALL. OH SORRY WOULD YOU LIKE TO COOK VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION EVERYONE HAS A PERSONAL EXPERIENCES HERE WHAT I WOULD SAY IS. OUR EXPERIENCES ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO DON'T HAVE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS TO GET THE CAR BUT TO YARD IN THE SITUATION THAT WE JUST DESCRIBED FAR MORE THAN THAT. ON AVERAGE IT'S ABOUT ELEVEN HUNDRED TO TWELVE HUNDRED DOLLARS BY THE TIME YOU ADD FEES AND AND STORAGE FEES AND AND AND THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEONE -- HAVING THE ASSET THAT THEY SPEND A LOT OF TIME TO TWO TO EARN OR LOSING THEIR THEIR CAR LOSING THEIR ABILITY TO GET TO WORK LOSING THEIR JOB. POTENTIALLY LOSING THEIR ONLY FROM A SHELTER -- WE THINK THIS IS A VERY MODEST STEP TO ADDRESS AND WITH THAT RESPECT THE OSCARS SUPPORT. LET'S DO A ROLL CALL SKINNER HI SKINNER AYE MOORLACH BRADFORD. RIGHT JACKSON MITCHELL AROUND. WELL NOW WIENER. ONE OF ONE SECOND OKAY MORE LIKE NOW. THANK YOU SENATORS. THANK YOU SEVEN MEMBER AT THE BILL WITH STAND CALL. AND LET'S SEE HERE WE HAD MISTER BONTA BUT IS HE ARE YOU STILL HERE OKAY GOOD I JUST DIDN'T SEE ON THE FRONT ROW ANYMORE. ALRIGHT WE'LL START WITH ITEM ONE A. B. THIRTY TWO MARTY MANAGED CARE AND COLLEAGUES AND STAFF THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT A. B. THIRTY TWO TODAY AB THIRTY TWO PERHAPS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. FOR ME DOING ARE ENTERING INTO A CONTRACT WITH A FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISON. FACILITY BEGINNING ON JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY AM COMPLETELY PHASE OUT THEIR USE BY. TWENTY TWENTY EIGHT SB THIRTY TWO WAS RECENTLY AMENDED. TO EXPAND THE BAND TO THE USE OF FOR PROFIT PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES GENERALLY. THIS INCLUDES THOSE FOR PROFIT DETENTION FACILITIES THAT HOUSE IMMIGRANT SUBJECT TO CIVIL THE TENSION. THE REALITY IS THAT THE FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PREVENT PRISONS AS FOR PROFIT CORPORATIONS HAVE A FIDUCIARY DUTY. TO MAXIMIZE THEIR PROFITS FOR THEIR SHAREHOLDERS AS A RESULT MAXIMIZING PROFITS OFTEN COMES AT THE EXPENSE OF DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIANS SUCH AS TREATMENT. pEDUCATION REHABILITATION SERVICES AND OTHER PROGRAMS THAT HELP CREATE A HIGHER CHANCE OF SUCCESS UPON RE ENTRY. IN MY VIEW THE FIDUCIARY DUTY OF FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISONS IS IN CONFLICT WITH THE INVESTMENT IN REHABILITATION OF PEOPLE THE REDUCTION OF RECIDIVISM RATES AND THE MAINTENANCE OF SAFE AND HEALTHY CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT. IT ALSO CONFLICTS WITH OUR VALUES AS A STATE AND OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT THE WELFARE AND WELL BEING. OF OUR RESIDENTS FOR PROFIT PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES HAVE REPEATEDLY FAILED WITH DOCUMENTED HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES INCLUDING INADEQUATE MEDICAL CARE AND MEDICAL ACCESS. AT THIS MOMENT IN HISTORY IN THE FACE OF SHAMEFUL ABUSES WE NEED TO TAKE STRONG ACTION TO DEFEND OUR VALUES OF JUSTICE AND DECENCY AND COMMON HUMANITY. IT IS CLEAR THAT THE GOALS OF OUR GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE STATE AND MAXIMIZE THEIR CHANCES FOR SUCCESS IS IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH THE GOALS OF THESE CORPORATIONS. WHICH IS TO MAKE AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE LOCKING UP CALIFORNIANS A. B. THIRTY TWO WILL BEGIN TO RE DIRECT OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO INVEST IN AN PRIORITIZE EFFECTIVELY ABILITY TO PROGRAMS. WHICH WILL MINIMIZE RECIDIVISM RATES AND MAXIMIZE SUCCESS FOR INMATES UPON THE RE ENTRY INTO SOCIETY. AND HELP INSURE SAFE AND HEALTHY CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT FOR CALIFORNIANS. WITH SB THIRTY TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR STATE'S COMMITMENT IS TO ITS PEOPLE. TO ITS PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE LIMITED TO STATE PRISONS BUT SHOULD STAND TO PROTECT EVERY CALIFORNIAN WHO'S IN THE CUSTODY OF A CORPORATION RUNNING A FOR PROFIT DETENTION FACILITY WE NEED TO DO MORE. TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE AND INVEST IN THEIR SUCCESS A. B. THIRTY TWO AS AMENDED SUCH AS DOWN THAT PATH. THANK YOU MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WITH ME HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB THIRTY TWO IS PROFESSOR BILL HANG. FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOL OF LAW AND RYAN SHERMAN WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION CO SPONSOR OF AB. THIRTY TWO THANK YOU CAN PROCEED. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- I WAS ASKED TO TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY THE COMMITTEE STAFF THE RACE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES ONE RELATES TO THE COMMERCE CLAUSE IN THE OTHERS THE TAKINGS CLAUSE. THE UNDER THE COMMERCE CLAUSE STATES ARE PROHIBITED FROM BURDENING COMMERCE IN WAYS LIKE SIGNIFICANTLY SIGNIFICANTLY AND DIRECTLY IMPEDE INTERSTATE. COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS THERE'S A PROVISION IN THE BILL THAT PREVENTS -- THE SENDING OF INMATES TO OUT OF STATE PRIVATE FACILITIES AND I SUPPOSE THAT THE RADICALLY THAT RAISES THE COMMERCE CLAUSE BUT WHEN THE STATE WHEN THE STATUTE REGULATES EVEN HANDEDLY. TO EFFECTUATE A LEGITIMATE LOCAL PUBLIC INTERESTS OF THE NATURE THAT THE THE SOMEONE BONTA AS OUTLINED ITS AFFECTS ON INTERSTATE COMMERCE ARE ONLY INCIDENTAL IT WILL BE UP HELD. UNLESS THE BURDEN IMPOSED ON SUCH COMMERCE IS CLEARLY EXCESSIVE IN RELATION TO THE PUNITIVE LOCAL BENEFITS. I'M I WOULD POINT OUT TO YOU THAT. OF AB THIRTY TWOS PROHIBITION FROM ENTERING INTO A CONTRACT WITH PRIVATE PRISON COMPANIES FROM OUT OF STATE. OF DISABILITIES APPLIES TO THE CALIFORNIA CDC ARE IT DOES NOT APPLY TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY THEREFORE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT HAVE STANDING ACTUALLY TO RAISE. OF A SO CALLED DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE CLING CLANG. SO THE COURT WILL NOT INVALIDATE. A STATE LAW MERELY BECAUSE AN ECONOMIST MIGHT THEORETICALLY FIND THE THE COST OF THE STATE LAW TO INTERSTATE COMMERCE EXCEEDS ITS BENEFIT TO LOCAL RESIDENTS THE COURT REQUIRES THE PERSON. CHALLENGING ON NON DISCRIMINATORY STATE LAW TO PROVIDE THAT THE BURDEN ON COMMERCE IS GROSSLY EXCESSIVE. SIMILARLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE TAKINGS CLAUSE. THE TAKINGS CLAUSE WILL ONLY BE. IMPLEMENTED IF AGAIN. IF THE GOVERNMENT REGULATES LAND IN A WAY THAT MAKES THE LAND TRULY VALUE LISTS AND THAT JUST WOULDN'T HAPPEN HERE EVEN IF OFF. OF A PRIVATE PRISON COMPANY OWN LAND IN THE STATE AND RAISE THE ISSUE THEY WOULD NOT BE PROHIBITED FROM ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS WITH DHS OR OTHER FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. OFFICIALS FROM DOING BUSINESS OUR STATE ON THE THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE STAFF ALSO OUTLINED ISSUES RELATED TO OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES THAT I WOULD DEFER. TO RELATED TO PREEMPTION -- AND AND AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE SUPREMACY CLAUSE SO IN MY VIEW THIS LAW IS CLEARLY CONSTITUTIONAL AND WOULD. WITHHOLD ANY CHALLENGE FROM PRIVATE COMPANIES OR FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS. THE MANAGER MEMBERS RANCHER WITH THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION PRIVATE FOR PROFIT PRISONS AND DETENTION CENTERS ARE ANATHEMA TO CALIFORNIA VALUES ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT. THE ALMOST DAILY NEWS ACCOUNTS OF THE HORRORS WITHIN THESE PRIVATE FOR PROFIT FACILITIES. SB THIRTY TWO WILL BAR THE RENEWAL OF CONTRACTS OF FOR PROFIT PRISONS AND DETENTION FACILITIES AND PHASE OUT THERE USE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. ASIDE FROM CAPITAL PUNISHMENT FOR THE PROVISION OF LIBERTY IS THE MOST SERIOUS OF ACTIONS TAKEN BY OUR GOVERNMENT. INCARCERATION IS INHERENTLY GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTION THERE SHOULD NEVER BE ANY TYPE OF PRIVATIZATION. INTHE COURTS CORRECTIONS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CIVIL ATTENTION WHEN THE GOVERNMENT IMPRISONS ITS RESIDENTS. IT MUST PERFORM THIS FUNCTION ITSELF AND SHOULD BE BARRED FROM DELEGATING THIS FISHEL ACTION TO LOWEST COMPETITIVE BETTER. MUST ASK OURSELVES. WHO SHOULD BE IN CHARGE OF INCARCERATING PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA? CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. OR MAKE PRISONS INCORPORATED. THE US IMMIGRATION CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT OR ACME CIVIL DETENTION LLC. FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISONS DETENTION CORPORATIONS OPERATE SOME OF THE MOST TROUBLED AND IN HUMANE SECURE FACILITIES IN OUR NATION. THOUGHTS ON STAFF AND ON THE INCARCERATED THE CURRENT RATE FACILITIES. ACCORDING TO OUR OUR REPORT LAST MONTH THE TWO MAIN PRIVATE FOR PROFIT PRISON COMPANIES GEO GROUP AND COURSE CIVIC SPENT FOUR POINT. ONE I'M SORRY FOUR POINT FOUR MILLION FEDERAL LOBBYING AND POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN MAY SEEM LIKE A LOT OF MONEY IT PALES IN COMPARISON. TO THE FOUR POINT ONE BILLION IN REVENUES THE COLLECTED DURING THAT SAME YEAR. IT JUST MAKES SENSE TO KEEP CALIFORNIA'S INMATES AND BILLIONS OF EXPENDITURES OF PUBLIC DOLLARS WITH OUR STATE AND SERVE EXPORTING TAXPAYER MONEY. TO OUT OF THE FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISON CORPORATIONS. THESE COMPANIES ARE TRADED ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE. AND MUST MEET THE FINANCIAL TARGETS OTHER INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS. THIS IS EVIDENCED IN THE QUOTE FROM THE CEO OF BANK CORRECTIONS CORPORATION OF AMERICA NO COURSE OF IT. WHEN HE STATED INMATES ARE A COMMODITY IN OUR LINE OF WORK? TREATING INMATES LIKE COMMODITIES MAY PROVE BENEFICIAL TO THE BOTTOM LINE OF THESE CORPORATIONS. BUT SUCH AN APPROACH DOES LITTLE TO REHABILITATE INMATES OR PROMOTE PUBLIC SAFETY UPON THE RELEASE OF THEIR COMMODITIES. BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. PRIVATE PRISON OPERATORS LOWER THE BAR WHEN IT COMES. TO THE CORRECTIONS PROFESSION THEY DO SO BY PROVIDING THE LEAST AMOUNT OF STAFF AND WORK POSSIBLE WILL EXPAND EXPENDING THE LEAST AMOUNT. IN ORDER TO INCREASE THEIR PROFITS FOR THEIR SHAREHOLDERS. KNOWLEDGE OF THE CAR SERRATION. BUT STILL THAT ALL INCARCERATION FACILITIES ARE PRONE TO CUSTODY RELATED ISSUES. PUBLIC PRISONS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY OUR ELECTED IF AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS WE ARE NOT PERFECT. BUT WE DO OUR BEST TO PULL THEIR SWORN OATH TO THE PEOPLE CONSTITUTION OF CALIFORNIA. AB THIRTY TWO INSURERS THE CALIFORNIA WILL NEVER AGAIN BE A COMPLICIT GOVERNMENT PARTNER WITH A FAILED EXPERIMENT THAT IS THE FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISON INDUSTRY. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

ALRIGHT LET'S HAVE THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WE CAN NEVER COME TO THE TABLE. THIS IS WHERE YOU'RE ALLOWED -- TO LARGE. MONEY MANAGER MEMBERS CHORUS ALSO HEAR ME OFF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION -- IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AND TO BE CLEAR OUR POSITION IS NOT BUILT ON A JUDGMENT FOR AGAINST PRIVATE PRISONS WERE. AGNOSTIC ON THE NOTION BUT RATHER OUR CONCERN IS TAKING TOOLS OFF THE TABLE -- THAT WILL RESULT IN EITHER PRISONER RELEASES FROM CDC ARE OR INCREASED PRESSURE ON COUNTY JAILS TO HOUSE THOSE INMATES WHO CANNOT FIT AT CVS YOUR SHIRT FOR NOT READY FOR ANOTHER REALIGNMENT -- THE BUFFER BETWEEN THE POPULATION RIGHT NOW IN THE STATE PRISONS -- AND THE FEDERALLY ORDERED POPULATION CAP IS LESS THAN TWO THOUSAND THERE'S ANOTHER VALLEY FEVER OUTBREAK IF THERE'S SOME SITUATION THAT TAKES A PRISON OFFLINE IF THERE'S A SPIKE IN POPULATION. DANGEROUS OFFENDERS WILL BE RELEASED OR THEY'LL BE SOUGHT TO BE HOUSED IN COUNTY JAILS THERE'S REALLY NOT MUCH ELSE IN WHEN IT COMES TO OPTIONS -- JAILS ARE ALREADY FACING SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FROM HAVING DANGEROUS OFFENDERS FOR-LONGER TERMS -- AND WE'RE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL WHICH WE THINK COULD EXACERBATE THOSE PROBLEMS THANK YOU. ANY OTHER OPPOSITION RIGHT -- QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE GUYS SENATOR WIENER. I THINK YOU'RE IN CHARGE ON A THANK THE AUTHOR -- RINGS FOR IT I WAS GOING TO I ASKED ABOUT IS A CO AUTHOR AND I LOOKED AND RECALL THAT I AMICALE. SO -- THIS IS -- OVERDUE I KNOW ANYTIME YOU GO THROUGH. A TRANSITION. THERE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE SOME AWKWARDNESS BUT THE REALITY IS THAT WE WE HAVE I I THINK. FAR TOO MUCH CAPACITY THAT WE BILL IN OUR EXISTING -- PRISON SYSTEM WE NEED TO WIND DOWN -- THE PRIVATE PRISONS AND THEN OF COURSE WE HAVE TO YOU KNOW -- WE'VE ALREADY REDUCE OUR OUR PRISON POPULATION OVERALL AT SOME POINT WE NEED AS THE CHAIR HAS COMMENTED BEFORE IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO CLOSE ONE OF OUR ACTUAL CDC OUR PRISONS -- BUT THIS IS A A SINGLE COULD START AND MOVING AWAY FROM NOT JUST MASS INCARCERATION BUT SOME OF THE ABUSES WE'VE SEEN -- AND SO I AM HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION SENATOR MORE LOCK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER CELLS HILLS -- PHILO PLEASE THEM. I WOULD ASSUME THAT SURE OF SIR NOT USING. BUT YOU'RE I GUESS WE ARE WE GONNA USE THE TERM PRISON FACILITIES OR OR DETENTION FACILITIES ARE PRIVATE FOR PROFIT MINISTRY OF FACILITIES WHAT. WE'RE WE'RE NOT USING THEM. AS A COST SAVINGS WERE JUST USING THEM AS THE TO HOUSE PEOPLE SHOULD YOUR FACILITIES BE. FULL IS THAT CORRECT -- CHAIR ASM THANK YOU -- THE JAILS PIECE OF THIS IS SO. FEES ARE AS STATE FACILITIES OBVIOUSLY AND THEN THEY HAVE PRIVATE CONTRACTED FACILITIES AT THESE FOR POPULATION MANAGEMENT. IF YOU TAKE THAT OFF THE TABLE AS THIS BILL DOES BEEN CCR HAS LIMITED OPTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING PEOPLE IN THAT HOUSING IN THE FACILITIES THAT CCR HAS PRISON FACILITIES -- OR WE EXPECT -- BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ASKED THIS QUESTION HOW ANY OF THE COUNTY JAIL BEDS ARE THERE THAT THERE WILL BE A DRAW AN ATTEMPT TO DRAW ON COUNTY JAIL FACILITIES AND THAT'S WHAT WERE CONCERNED ABOUT IN THIS REGARD SO. THAT THE PRIVATE FACILITIES ARE NOT TAKING JAIL CAPACITY -- IT'S JUST AGAIN IT'S ONE IT'S ONE THING THAT THE STATE HAS ON THE TABLE AND AND THAT'S OUR CONCERN IS THE SORT OF TRICKLE DOWN IF YOU WILL ON HOW THAT COULD IMPACT COUNTY JAIL FACILITIES. DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO HOUSE AN INDIVIDUAL WITH CDC ARE FOR A YEAR. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE IF YOU JUST DIVIDE THE TOTAL BUDGET OF CITIES ARE BY THE NUMBER OF INMATES THAT OUR HOUSE THAT IS AROUND EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. BUT MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE MARGINAL RATE THE ACTUAL DIFFERENCE FROM RELEASING ONE PERSON BECAUSE YOU STILL HAVE ALL OF THE OVERHEAD IN THE YOU DON'T LOSE THE ECONOMIES OF SCALE BUT IT'S ABOUT TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS THE MARGINAL RATE. THEN WHAT IS IT COSTING TO USE A PRIVATE. FACILITY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT RATE IS CERTAIN. THEN -- I JUST WONDER IF MAYBE PROVIDE WILL BALANCE AT LEAST THE INDIVIDUAL FROM RIVERSIDE -- MENTION THAT THEY WEREN'T PERFECT AND I WOULD JUST SAY AS A FORMER COUNTY SUPERVISOR HAVING HAD TO DEAL WITH THE JAILS. IN THE LAWSUIT. AND THE CULTURE -- I WOULD SAY THAT'S CORECT INSIDE I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN MAKE COMPARISON. TO A PRIVATE INSTITUTION VERSUS A PUBLIC INSTITUTION BUT THEY'RE BOTH. BOTH HAVE ISSUES I WOULD WANT TO SPEND A NIGHT EITHER. ONE SO -- BUT I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT BLOCKING A PRIVATE SECTOR OPPORTUNITY. SO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AT THANK YOU -- WE'VE GOT A MOTION AS BEFORE YOU CLOSE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER INAPPROPRIATE SHINS IF YOU'D BE WILLING I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR I TEND NOT TO CO AUTHOR BILLS THAT ARE GOING TO COME BEFORE MY COMMITTEE UNTIL WE'RE THROUGH THE COMMITTEE -- BUT I WILL BE RECOMMENDING I SO IF YOU BUT YOU MAY CLOSE WE ARE HAVING A CO AUTHOR MET MADAM CHAIR. OF AND THANK YOU FOR THAT FOR THE POINTS JUST A JUST A FEW ON A REASONED RESPONSE ONE IS IN IN MY HUMBLE OPINION AS A LEGISLATOR. I THINK THAT. SOME OPTIONS JUST SHOULD NOT BE ON THE TABLE WHEN THE LEVEL OF OF ABUSE AND MISTREATMENT IS AS HIGH AS IT IS -- I UNDERSTAND THAT -- IT'S SEEN AS AN OPTION BUT IT'S AN OPTION WHERE. NOT FOR PROFIT PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES I'M TALKING ABOUT IN PRISONS BUT IT'S AN OPTION WHERE -- WE HAVE -- CHRONICALLY CHRONIC UNDER STAFFING. WHERE WE HAVE AN ADEQUATE TRAINING BUT WE HAVE INADEQUATE PAY -- WHERE WE HAVE LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AND INADEQUATE HEALTHCARE WE HAVE ASSAULTS OF INMATES ON OTHER INMATES IN INMATES ON STAFF? AT MUCH HIGHER RATES -- SO I'VE SEEN STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT THAT THE FOR PROFIT PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES COST MORE. BUT EVEN IF THEY COST LESS. THE THE OUTCOMES FOR CALIFORNIANS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND THAT'S WHY I'M I'M PUSHING FOR OUR AT THE END OF THEIR USE. THAT WE SHOULD NOT SUBJECT CALIFORNIANS TO SUCH CONDITIONS -- WHERE THEIR HEALTH AND WELFARE AND SAFETY IS PUT AT RISK EVERY DAY? WE HAVE A CHOICE AND WE CAN DO DIFFERENTLY -- WE DID ASK ABOUT THE CAPACITY FOR IN STATE COUNTY AND CITY JAIL BEDS -- WITH THE IDEA THAT IT SHOULD WE EVER NEED -- COULD ADDITIONAL CAPACITY AND WE DON'T NOW AND WHAT WERE UNDER THE QUARTER CAP AND WIH THINGS I PROP 47-57. OUR NEED FOR BEDS IS EVER DECREASING BUT IF WE EVER NEEDED THEM WE COULD AT ARMS LENGTH -- HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THAT AS A COUNTY JAIL POTENTIALLY IF THE COUNTY JAIL WANTED. AND THEY WERE THE PAY IN THE COMPENSATION FROM THE STATE WAS ADEQUATE THE SECURITY LEVELS RIGHT -- WE COULD PUT -- CALIFORNIANS IN A PUBLIC FACILITY WHERE THERE'S OVERSIGHT AND TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AN APPROPRIATE TRAINING AN APPROPRIATE STAFFING -- OF COURSE TO AS YOU HAVE MENTIONED THAT WE CAN DO BETTER AND ALL OF OUR FACILITIES INCLUDING OUR PUBLIC FACILITIES. BUT BOB BETTER TO HAVE A FACILITY WHERE YOU'RE NOT DRIVEN BY THE MIGHTY DOLLAR. I AND YOUR DRIVEN BY -- WHAT LEGISLATIVE POLICY IS AND THAT IS TO TO BE ABILITY -- CALIFORNIANS PREPARE THEM FOR A BETTER FUTURE. FOR SEX FOR SUCCESSFUL REENTRY -- THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD BE SPENDING OUR DOLLARS -- SO I THINK THE TIME IS CALM I I I DO BELIEVE -- THAT THESE OF FOR PROFIT PRIVATE PRISONS AND DETENTION FACILITIES WAS WAS WRONG THEN AND IT'S WRONG NOW. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THE COURSE OF WHERE WE'RE GOING -- WITH RESPECT THAT TO THIS POLICY IN I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT. YOU SUPPORT AB THIRTY TWO SO WE CAN DO JUST HAT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY -- RESPECT THE ASTEROID BELT. ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION IT IS -- TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS WHATEVER ROLL CALL SKINNER HI SKINNER AYE MOORLACH. MORE LIKE NO BRADFORD JACKSON. MITCHELL MORALE. AROUND NOW WINNER. I WIENER AYE. BILLS ON CALL FOR YOU HAVE A YOUR NEXT BILL. IS -- AB. THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE MANAGER BECAUSE OF A WITNESSES SCHEDULE IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO TAKE AB SIXTEEN SIXTY NINE FIRST YES. YES WE ALL DO IT OUT OF ORDER AND YOU CAN. NOW PERCENT IS A YOUR NEXT BILL AB SIX EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE AND THEN WILL RETURN. TO THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR A COLLEAGUES AND STUFF ONCE AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT A. B.. SIXTEEN SIXTY NINE WHICH PROMOTES GREATER PUBLIC SAFETY IN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE POLICY ENFORCEMENT MODEL. FOR INDEPENDENT -- AMMUNITION VENDORS THAT CALIFORNIA'S GUN SHOWS CURRENT LAW OUTLINES PUBLIC SAFETY MEASURES FOR FIRE ARMS DEALERS WHO SELL AMMUNITION AT GUN SHOWS IN THE STATE. HOWEVER INDEPENDENT AMMUNITION VENDORS DO NOT RECEIVE THE SAME SCRUTINY AND THEY SHOULD A. B. SIXTEEN SIXTY NINE WOULD CORRECT THIS DISCREPANCY BY REQUIRING INDEPENDENT AMMUNITION VENDORS TO BE LICENSED. VENDORS ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WOULD REDUCE THE NON REGULATORY FEE FOR THE FIREARMS TRANSACTIONS. FROM NINETEEN DOLLARS TO ONE DOLLAR AND AUTHORIZED THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TO CHARGE A FEE OF THIRTY ONE DOLLARS IN NINETEEN CENTS PER FIREARMS RELATED TRANSACTIONS SOLELY TO COVER THE COST. OF ITS FIRE ARMS RACE RELATED REGULATORY AND ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES. A COLLEAGUES THERE ARE HUNDRED GUN SHOWS A YEAR IN CALIFORNIA THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR ENFORCING FIREARMS LAWS AT THESE GUN SHOWS. AB SIXTEEN SIXTY NINE ENSURES THAT THE DEPARTMENT. HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO PERFORM THE DUTIES TO KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE I HAVE WITH ME HERE TODAY ACTUALLY AIRS WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE SPONSOR OF AB SIXTEEN SIXTY NINE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. HAVE YET TO SET. MAYBE HER SEAT. THANK YOU HOW WE HAVE TO GET TRAINED ON WE LIKE. TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA FOR OFFERING THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEASURE. AT THERE ARE TWO PARTS TO THIS BILL AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER PRESENTED AT THE FIRST PORTION IS IN RELATION TO INDEPENDENT AMMUNITION VENDORS. THE OP PROP SIXTY THREE FIFTY FOR ALL ACT REQUIRED AND VENDOR LICENSES. FOR HAVE AMMUNITION. FOR THOSE SELLING AMMUNITION GOING FORWARD AFTER THE ENACTMENT HOWEVER THERE THE GUN SHOW ACT PORTIONS OF THE PENAL CODE WORD LEFT ON TOUCH TO SO THIS IS. A BIT OF A CLEAN UP FOR THOSE SECTIONS IN ORDER TO TREAT ALL AMIN ALL VENDORS WHO WERE SELLING AMMUNITION EQUALLY SO DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE SELLING. EMISSION EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY BE IN STATE OR OUT OF STATE SO LONG AS YOU IF YOU ARE SELLING AMMUNITION YOU ARE SELLING AMMUNITION YOU'RE BEING TREATED EQUALLY UNDER THE LAW AND BE REQUIRED. TO UNDERGO THE SAME APPLICATION PROCESS IS THE ONLY THING REQUIREMENTS AS ANYONE ELSE REGARDLESS OF YOUR BROKEN WATER OR IF YOU'RE LOCATED IN STATE OR OUT OF STATE. NOW THE SECOND MORE COMPLICATED PORTION OF THE BILL IS IN RELATION TO THE DRESS THE DRESS HE WAS ORIGINALLY ENACTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AND WAS WAS BE FOR BACKGROUND CHECKS SINCE THE INITIAL ENACTMENT OF THE DRAW CITY. THE ITEMS THAT THE FEE WAS INTENDED TO COVER HAS GROWN TO A LIST OF ELEVEN DIFFERENT ITEMS. PENAL CODE SECTION TWENTY TWO TO FIVE BE IS ONE THROUGH ELEVEN WHAT IT IS THAT WE HAVE DONE IN THIS BILL AS WE HAVE PULLED OUT FOR REGULATORY ACTIVITIES AND ITEM BE. ELEVEN RELATING TO THE SALE POSSESSION TRANSFER LOAN. OF A FIRE AND PUT THAT IN THE-NEW PENAL CODE SECTION PENAL CODE SECTION TWENTY EIGHT TWO THREE THREE AND WE HAVE MADE THAT SECTION THE FEE FOR THIRTY ONE DOLLARS AND NINETEEN CENTS. WHEREAS THE REIMBURSEMENTS RELATED TO THE AND AGAIN THE NON REGULATORY ACTIVITIES REMAIN IN THE ORIGINAL PENAL CODE SECTION. THIS IS INTENDED TO FIND AGAIN THE PROGRAMMATIC AND THE REGULATORY ACTIVITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT'S BUREAU FIREARMS. NOW I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE BUT THE THOUGHT AGAIN WE ARE. BORROWED THE LANGUAGE FROM TWENTY TWO TO FIVE BE ELEVEN TO SAY. THAT THE FEES INTENDED TO COVER ANYTHING RELATED TO THE SALE LOAN TRANSFER FOR POSSESSION OF A FIREARM AND WE CLARIFIED. THAT POSSESSION MAY INCLUDE LAWFUL AND OR UNLAWFUL POSSESSION WHICH MAY ENCOMPASS THE ARMED AND PROHIBITED PERSON SYSTEM THERE'S NOTHING EXCLUDING APPS. FROM BEING ADDRESSED BY THIS FEE HOWEVER THE DEPARTMENT DOES INTEND TO USE OF THIRTEEN DOLLARS. AND NINETEEN CENTS INCREASE FOR THE REGULATORY ACTIVITIES IN THE REGULATORY ACTIVITIES IN THE BACKGROUND CHECKS ONLY. THE APPS FOR GRAHAM PURSUANT TO THE BUDGET AND THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IS NOW FUNDED BY GENERAL FUND. SO IF WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. GO AHEAD NEXT WITNESS YEAH AMANDA WILCOX ON BEHALF OF BRADY CALIFORNIA NINE EIGHT AGAINST COMPLIANCE WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL -- THE SECTION RELATED TO IT AMIL AMMUNITION SELLERS AT GUN SHOWS IN CALIFORNIA THINGS PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD IN TERMS OF MAKING A CONSISTENT WITH REQUIREMENTS A PROP SIXTY THREE IN MAKING SURE THOSE. AMMO SELLERS ARE LICENSED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ARE IN THE REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN TERMS OF DEALERS AND VENDORS THAT ARE -- PRESENT AND A GUN SHOW IN CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF THE TROPHY THIS SEEMS LIKE A DRAMATIC INCREASE UP TO THIRTY TWO DOLLARS IN NINETEEN CENTS -- HOWEVER IF THE FEE HAD BEEN RABIES AS I BELIEVE IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALL ALONG CONSISTENT WITH THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX THAT FEE WOULD BE TWENTY SIX DOLLARS. I BELIEVE TODAY SO THAT INCREASE IS NOT AS DRAMATIC. AS IT. APPEARS ARMED OBVIOUSLY COSTS HAVE GONE UP SINCE THE LAST INCREASE IN NINETEEN NOT OUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR LABOR COSTS HAVE GONE UP IN CERTAINLY THE WORK LOAD AND THE GIRL FIREARMS IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY NOT ONLY THE APPS PROGRAM WHICH AS WE DISCUSSED BEFORE HAS BEEN A FRUSTRATION.AND A DEMAND ON GRAY ON FOR OF RESOURCES BUT ALSO THE NUMBER BACKGROUND CHECKS THAT HAVE TO OCCUR. MINOR TING GUN SHOWS -- GUN DEALERS EVERY TIME WE PASS A NEW LAW AND I'M PART OF THAT I'D MET -- DOJ HAS TO DO THAT TECH UPGRADES AND CHANGE THEIR SYSTEMS SO IMPLEMENT NEW IMPLEMENTATIONS COSTS -- THAN HIGH NUMBER OF GUN SALES COSTS OBVIOUSLY THERE IT'S IS THE IMPACT ON THE RP BUT A PERSON SYSTEM PROGRAM BUT ON THE OTHER ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AND OF COURSE THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB IS TO IN THE BACKGROUND CHECK WHICH I HAD THOUGHT THE NINETEEN DOLLARS. COVERED IT DOES NOT A COST CONSIDERABLY MORE -- SO I THINK DOJ NEWS NEEDS THE RESOURCES TO THE JOB TO DO THE JOB THAT CERTAINLY MY ORGANIZATION EXPECTS THEM TO DO. BUT ALSO ON THAT AS LEGISLATORS AND LAWS THAT YOU'VE ENACTED -- YOU EXPECT THOSE LAWS TO BE FULLY ENFORCED THIS IS WHERE WE ARE I BELIEVE NOW IN CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF WORK ON LOS. ENFORCEMENT AND RESOURCES TO CONTINUE IN THE DECLINE IN OUR FIREMAN DEATH RATE -- DECLINE THAT LEADS THE NATION IN REDUCING FARM INJURY AND DEATH -- BUT WE NEED RESOURCES TO DO THAT THE DRIVE VOTE. THANK YOU LET'S SEE IF THERE'S OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. BRENT SPENCE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS IN SUPPORT. CALVIN QUICKLY AREAS STUDENT ACTIVISTS IN SUPPORT ANY OTHERS. ALRIGHT LET'S THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION -- WILL NEED TO MAKE ROOM AT THE TABLE BUT GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE RECORD DÃ¢N RE WITH NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION ALSO HERE FOR CALIFORNIA RIFLE ASSOCIATION TODAY. THIS IS A PRETTY CONFUSING BILL -- AND I'LL JUST BRIEFLY GO OVER THE GUN SHOW WE FEEL THAT THE GUN SHOW PORTIONS ARE UNNECESSARY AS THE LAWS OF THE STATE APPLY NO MATTER WHETHER YOU'RE AT A GUN SHOW. OR OFF SITE AND WE FEEL THAT FALL TO CODE CLEANUP IT IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO ENFORCEMENT TODAY -- OR OPPOSITIONS REALLY HEDGES ON ON THE DROVES INCREASES IT'S GOING TO DRAMATICALLY. INCREASE AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING ON WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE THE FEES ARE PAID BY -- PEOPLE WHEN THEY GOING TO PURCHASE A FIREARM RIGHT NOW WHAT IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE DRUGS HE'S ACTUALLY MADE UP OF SEVERAL FEES AND SO YOU HAVE -- THE NINETEEN DOLLARS WHICH IS ACTUALLY DID EUROCITY WHICH IS ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO GO TOWARDS BACKGROUND CHECKS AND REGISTRIES. MANY OF A ONE DOLLAR FIREARM SAFETY ACT FEE AND A FIVE DOLLAR FIRE ARM SAFETY IN ENFORCEMENT THE AS WELL AS OTHER PHYSICAL CLING FSE SIX CETERA. I'M INTO WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. IS THAT NINETEEN DOLLAR FEE IS GETTING MOVED DOWN TO ONE DOLLAR. AND THEY'RE LIMITING THE APPLICATION OF THAT ONE DOLLAR FEE. AND THEN THERE CREATING AN ENTIRELY NEW FEE -- WHICH WE FEEL IS A TAX BECAUSE OF THE BROAD APPLICATION IT CAN BE USED. FOR AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S HAPPENING IS -- TWENTY EIGHT TO THREE IS NOT EVEN BEING ADDRESS WHICH STILL SEEMS TO ALLOW TO BE. DONE DOT TO CHARGE FOURTEEN DOLLARS AND I I WOULD LIKE SOME. BIG THAT NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF CLARIFICATION ON THAT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW A LOT OF THIS HINGES ON AND SO I THINK THAT THAT IT THAT SECTION NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT WHETHER. THEY COULD STILL POTENTIALLY CHARGE. UNDER THAT NOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF OF DROGO'S OVER THE COURSE OF TIME IT IT HAS INCREASED YES. AND IN FACT TO ROCES AMASSED A SURPLUS IN THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS NOT THAT LONG AGO -- THIS FEE. BACK IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSAND WE'RE ABLE TO BORROW I THINK AROUND TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO GO TOWARDS OUR APPS PROGRAM. AND IF YOU LOOK AT GUN SALES VAN AS IS SO SEATED WITH NOW CONCEALS WERE ABOUT HALF OF WHAT THEY ARE TODAY. SO PRESUMABLY DOJ'S GETTING A WHOLE LOT MORE MONEY COMING IN IN FACT FOR THE LAST. UP TO SEVEN SEVEN YEARS OR SO CALIFORNIA'S BEEN DOING OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND SURE FARM TRANSACTIONS. SO IF WE WERE ABLE. TO A MASS THAT KIND OF SURPLUS WHEN FIREARM SALES WERE HALF OF WHAT THEY ARE PRESUMABLY THEY'RE TAKING IN ALL CLOSE TO TWICE AS MUCH MONEY. NOW GRANTED THE DOJ DOES HAVE MORE CONSTRAINTS ON THEM AND THAT IS SUBJECT SUBJECT TO LITIGATION WHICH WAS MENTIONED -- THERE WAS CITY -- RULING THAT SAID IT WASN'T A TAXING GENTRY CASE IN THE LOWER COURTS BUT THAT IS ON APPEAL AND THURS THEY'RE THEY'RE LOOKING AT THE SINCLAIR PAIN CASES TO WHETHER THAT'S GOING. TO BE -- YEP HELD IN THE COURT OF APPEALS. BUT I THINK THAT BEFORE WE GO ABOUT AND INCREASING THIS THIS WEEK THIS FEATURE MANICALLY WE NEED TO ACTUALLY LOOK AND SEE WHAT WERE THOSE THAT MONEY'S GOING. THERE IS AN HONOR REQUEST A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT WAS DENIED BECAUSE OF THAT PENDING LITIGATION BUT BEFORE WE GO AND WRITE THIS. THIS MASSIVE CHECK I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO EXAMINE WHERE THAT MONEY'S GOING. AND NOT CONTINUE TO PUT MORE AND MORE COST CONSTRAINTS ON GUN OWNERS -- TO FOR THE FUN OF FIREARMS DIVISION WITH WITH THIS BROAD CHARGING STATUTE. IT'S FOR THAT. AND MANY OTHER REASONS THAT WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO A ALSO ONE OTHER NOTE -- I KNOW THAT. THERE WAS MENTION THAT CUT BACKGROUND CHECKS SALES HAVE GONE UP BUT WE'VE HEARD THAT -- EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE MORE CHECKS TODAY IT'S LESS LABOR INTENSIVE BECAUSE WE BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE AUTOMATED WITH OUR RECORD SYSTEM IN THE SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN IMPROVED SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRING MORE PERSONNEL. TO DO MORE CHECKS SO WITH THAT THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. THE MANAGER MEMBERS SAMPRAS REPRESENTING GUN WAS CALIFORNIA JUST A COUPLE OF POINTS TO FOR THE CLERK FIVE WITH MY COLLEAGUES. HAS POINTED OUT ON THE THE AMMUNITION LAWS. DO NOT EXEMPT ANYBODY -- WHETHER YOU'RE A GUN SHOW DEALER OR OUT OF STATE DELIVER ANYTHING IT INCLUDES EVERYBODY SO. THE ADDITION OF THE OF THE CLEANUP LANGUAGES IS NOT AS DIRE AS YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MAKE IT -- THAT THAT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT ALL AMMUNITION VENDORS AT ALL GUN SHOWS COMPLY WITH ALL OF THE AMMUNITION -- SELLING LAWS -- AND AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND ALL OF THAT SO THAT THAT -- KIND OF PUT THAT TO REST IN OUR OPINION. THE THE THE SWITCHING OF THE THE FUN FROM THE REGULAR DRAWS TO THIS NEW CHAPTER -- OR OR NEW NEW NEW SECTION -- IT CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN JUST THE ATTACKS I THINK THAT THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS ADD. UP AND DOWN THE ROAD SO FAR -- IT WAS AT FIRST -- STATED AS A TWO THIRDS VOTE -- AND NOW IT'S IT'S MAGICALLY NOT -- BECAUSE OF NO CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S BEEN RAISED AND WHAT IS BEING SPENT FOR JUST HOW IT'S BEING CATEGORIZED IN THE IN THE STATUTE SO -- IF IT LOOKS LIKE A DUCK IN IT. SOUNDS LIKE A DUCK IT'S PROBABLY A DOCK SO IN THAT CASE WE WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS -- ATTACKS AND ONE POINT THAT MY COLLEAGUE MADE THAT WAS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. GIVEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THE DROSE FEE WAS NOT INCREASED BY THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX BECAUSE IT ACCUMULATED. AS MY COLLEAGUE POINTED OUT TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SURPLUS THERE WAS NO NEED TO RAISE THAT BE IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT. DURING THAT TIME OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WAS ALLOCATED FOR FOR BACKGROUND CHECKS AND THE OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DRAW SPEED -- WERE BEING PAID FOR THEN AS WAS POINTED OUT TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WAS BORROWED FROM THE DRAWS FUND IN ORDER TO TRY TO GET APPS TO CATCH UP -- IT DID. DIDN'T SUCCEED TO TO ANY -- A GREAT EXTENT A AND THAT THAT LOAN HAS NOT BEEN REPEATED TO THE DRAWS FND AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL. WE'VE BEEN ASKING FOR AUDITS IN ORDER TO FIND AND VERIFY THAT INFORMATION SO THAT FUND IS GOT. BEAUCOUP BUCKS AND WE WE STILL LOOK UPON THIS IS A TAX -- IT'S PRETTY. A SHIRT MOST ASSURED THAT -- WITH THAT IT WILL BE LITIGATED IF THIS BILL. DOES PASS AND IS SIGNED. BY THE GOVERNOR SO FOR THESE REASONS AND HOME A LOT MORE -- WITH GUNNERS CALIFORNIA'S IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THANK YOU. MEDICS WITNESS IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR KATHY LET'S REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION AS FAR CLUB INTERNATIONAL OUTDOOR SPORTS IS COALITION CALIFORNIA SPORTSMEN'S LOBBY AND CROSSROADS OF THE WEST GUN SHOWS.

ALL RIGHT TIME TO WE HAVE A MOTION. RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION BEFORE US. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT I THINK THIS IS LIKE A COMMONSENSE BILL ON THE INDEPENDENT AMMUNITION VENDOR COMPONENT AND A WISE USE OF OF RESOURCES. TO FULFILL THE REQUIREMENTS AND THE OBLIGATIONS AND DUTIES OF THE DOJ'S OR SPEC LAST YEAR YOUR ITEM. THANK YOU -- THE MOTION IS DO YOU PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS -- LET'S DO A ROLL CALL SKINNER HI SKINNER I'M MORE LOCK. LIKE NOW BRADFORD BRADFORD AYE JACKSON. MITCHELL. MITCHELL AYE MORALE. AROUND -- WIENER. RIGHT BILLS ARE CALL NOW WILL GO TO YOUR NEXT AND LAST BILL WHICH IS -- A. B.. THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE THANK YOU MANAGER AND COLLEAGUES THE STAFF ONCE AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT A. B. THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE I WANNA FIRST START BY EXCEPT -- SAYING THAT I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR THIS BILL AND I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR HARD WORK. ON IT ON THE BILL WORKS TO ADDRESS DATA GAPS AND IMPROVE ACCURACY IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE INFORMATION BY ENHANCING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. AND INCREASING DATA TRANSPARENCY CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL RECORDS DO NOT PAINT THE WHOLE PICTURE. MISSING INFORMATION AND INACCURACIES IN DATA UNDERMINE THE FAIR ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND OUR ABILITY AS LAWMAKERS TO ESTABLISH BEST PRACTICES. FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE AB THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE SETS CLEAR REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND COURTS AND HELP WITH DATA TRANSPARENCY AND ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY. AMONG OTHER CRITERIA THE FOLLOWING MUST BE REPORTED PERSONS IDENTIFYING INFORMATION A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AND IDENTIFICATION NUMBER DATE OF ARREST CHARGE DISPOSITION AT SUCH A WITH MORE ACCURATE DATA AND MORE REGULAR AND CONSISTENT -- FREQUENCY OF REPORTING OF THAT DATA CALIFORNIA WILL BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT A MORE FAIR AND SAFE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND BE ABLE TO MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR STATE. PROGRAMS IF WE ARE TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE AND FIX OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WE MUST START AT THE FOUNDATIONAL LEVEL. IN THIS CASE WITH GOOD DATA SB THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE IS THE FIRST STEP IN ENSURING WE HAVE RELIABLE AND COMPLETE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA I RESPECTFULLY. ASK THE AYE VOTE. I HAVE WITH ME HERE TODAY ADD. LITTLE WITH CALIFORNIANS RECEIVED INJUSTICE AND MARIA MCKEE SAM TO SCHOOL DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. ARE YOU MAY PROCEED WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING I'M MARIA MCKEE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WHERE I SERVE AS THE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AND ANALYTICS. CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IN EVIDENCE BASED DATA DRIVEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLICY AND REFORM YET OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE OUR CRIMINAL HISTORY DATA INFRASTRUCTURE HAS NOT BEEN MEANING FULLY UPDATED IN ALMOST FIFTY YEARS. THERE ARE TWO CRITICAL ISSUES WITH CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORDS THAT EIGHTY THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE SEEKS TO ADDRESS. FIRST THEY LACK TIMELY INFORMATION AND SECOND THERE OFTEN INCOMPLETE AND MISSING INFORMATION ALL TOGETHER. IMAGINE ASKING AN ER DOCTOR TO MAKE A DIAGNOSIS WITH OUT OF DATE INCOMPLETE INFORMATION. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE ASKING DECISION MAKERS ACROSS THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO DO EVERY DAY. THIS HAS REAL CONSEQUENCES FOR PUBLIC SAFETY AND FOR JUSTICE. FOR EVERYTHING FROM RISK ASSESSMENT TO GUN CONTROL TODD TO RECORD CLEARANCE. BAD DATA IS DEPRIVING OUR STATE OF BETTER OUTCOMES WE ARE OVERDUE IN ADDRESSING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE DATA GAP. CALIFORNIA CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY ENTER THE MODERN ERA OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE OPERATIONS AND REFORM WITHOUT ADDRESSING THIS GAP. AB THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE TAKES AN ESSENTIAL STEP TOWARDS IMPROVING THE QUALITY AND TIMELINESS OF CRIMINAL RECORD REPORTING IN CALIFORNIA. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU MY NAME IS EDWARD LITTLE. ON I'M REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA'S FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AB THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE WILL IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND CENTRALIZATION OF CRIMINAL HISTORY DATA TO INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY. AND DATA DRIVEN POLICY DEVELOPMENT. ALTHOUGH CALIFORNIA HAS A RAY OF MANDATES REPORTING IS NOT DONE CONSISTENTLY. AND LIKE CENTRAL AS REPORTING. AS A RESULT CRIMINAL RECORDS SUFFER FROM PERVASIVE DATA GAPS AND UNDERMINE THEIR ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY INCLUDING MISSING AND OR DELAYED ARREST AND CASE DISPOSITION. MISSING INFORMATION. AND MISSING AND COMPLETE SENTENCING. INFORMATION. THE SOLUTION IS AB. THIRTY THIRTY ONE SB THIRTY THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE HELPS TO MODERNIZE OUR CRIMINAL HISTORY DATABASE BY ESTABLISHING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL ADDRESS DATA GAPS AND ALLOW FOR AUTOMATED RECORDS MANAGEMENT IN THE FUTURE. CALIFORNIA'S DESERVE. AS MUCH ATTENTION TO AND RESEARCH INTO OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AS POSSIBLE. A ROBUST SCHOLARLY RESEARCH DRIVEN CONVERSATION ABOUT THE OPERATION OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHERE AND WHEN IT WORKS AND WHERE AND WHEN IT FAILS. AND HOW IT CHANGES OUTCOMES ON AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL. AND ON A MASS SCALE ISCRITICAL FOR EVEN SEEING FOR IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEMS WE NEED TO FIX. THESE CRITICAL EXAMINATIONS AND CONVERSATIONS MAKE CALIFORNIA A SAFER. IMPROVING THEM MEANS ENSURING THAT WERE HAVING AS MANY ARGUMENTS AS POSSIBLE. CALIFORNIA'S FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE BELIEVES THAT A RAPE AND BARRIERS THAT KEEP PEOPLE FROM BEING ABLE TO STUDY OUR SYSTEM. AND ADD TO THE CONVERSATION FOR HAVING ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE IT IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE. IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND WHO HAVE A REAL LIFT EXPERIENCE WITH THIS IN ADDITION TO RESEARCH. POSITION TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE CRITICAL DATA. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER LITTLE ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. DETACHMENTS FROM HAVE FOR SMART JUSTICE CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT.

MAYBE WE CAN MAKE SOME ROOM AT THE TABLE [inaudible] THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MEMBERS WHO SHALL MUCH ARE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT. FORSMAN ASSOCIATION OF RECORD SUPERVISORS IRIX RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL -- I DID TALK TO THE AUTHOR PERSONALLY -- AFTER ON COMMITTEE AND ASSEMBLY SIDE -- OF COURSE WE DO NOT OPPOSE THE CONCEPT OF TIMELY AND ACCURATE PORTING AND WE SUPPORT THAT CONCEPT HOWEVER -- WE ARE OPPOSITION TO THE BILL IN RESPECT OF HAVING THAT THIRTY DAY -- CURRENT REPORTING GOING DOWN TO A WEAK REPORTING -- I UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT A FISCAL COMMITTEE BUT THIS IS A HUGE MANDATE ON OVER FOUR HUNDRED LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHO ARE NOW GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO COMPLETELY. CHANGE AND THEIR RECORD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO BE ABLE. TO FULFILL THIS REQUIREMENT -- ALSO I WE'RE NOT UNCLEAR -- WHAT IT DO TIONAL DATA WOULD BE REQUIRED BY DISPEL -- CURRENTLY -- ALL THESE A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO REPORT ON A MONTHLY BASIS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. ON THE THINGS THAT ARE ALREADY ON IN EXISTING LAW SO WE'RE NOT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT DOES TIONAL INFORMATION WOULD BE REQUIRED THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL -- TO UP MAKING OUT PUBLIC ANY SAFER -- SUPPORTERS REASONS THAT WE RESPECTFULLY -- ASK FOR ID AND NO VOTE AND WE WILL OBVIOUSLY -- TALK ABOUT THE FISCAL IMPACTS OF THIS BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE COMMITTEE THANK YOU. YOU. GOOD MORNING MARK NEVER THE JUDICIAL COUNCILS WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK THE OFFICE OFFICE AND STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US LISTING THEIR CONCERNS ON THE BILL AND INVITING US TO BE PART OF THE PROCESS. UNFORTUNATELY THE COUNCIL IS OPPOSED TO THIS BILL MUST AMENDED AND FUNDED IN THE FUNDED PIECES REALLY -- KIND OF THIS CONCERN TO FOR CLARITY ON WHETHER THEY MEAN FOR THE RECORDS TO BE. REFER THE COMMISSION REPORTED WHEN THEY CASES FILED ORDERS DISPOSED. IF IF IT'S ONE IS FILE THE BE A WORKLOAD COSTS AND WILL BE ADDRESS THAT IN FISCAL COMMITTEE BUT IF IT'S AT THIS POSITION IT'S JUST THE COST UPDATE OUR EXISTING COURT TECHNOLOGY. AND SYSTEMS TO ACCOMMODATE FOR THE PORTAL CARMEN'S. WE'RE CONCERNED ALSO FOR THE DELAYED EFFECTIVE DATE OR WHERE THE TYPICALLY I. T. -- LARGE I. T. CHANGES THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE NEED SOME ADDITIONAL TIME ESPECIALLY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE -- TO GO THROUGH THE STATE PROCESS TO GET THEIR I. T. SYSTEM PROVED NOW ALSO WHATEVER'S SOLUTION THEY CHOOSE TO REPORT THE DATA THAT WILL. IMPACT THE COSTS THE COURTS AND HOW WILL OF A BONFIRE SYSTEMS TO COMPLY WITH REQUIREMENTS THE FINAL PIECE FOR AMENDMENT AT FOUR SEGMENTS FOR IS TECH CLARIFY THE EXISTING REPORTING SECTION OR UNDER PINNACLED. ONE THREE ONE FIVE ONE I THAT REQUIRES THE COURTS TO REPORT DATA EVERY THIRTY DAYS WHERE IS THIS WITH A CART WEEKLY. THE COURTS ARE SEEKING SOME CLARITY ON WHICH PARTICULAR THAT TIME FRAME WE'RE DOING OBVIOUSLY IF IT'S ONE WE PULLED BY THE WEEKLY BUT IF IT'S A WEEKLY IN THIRTY DAYS THERE'S SORT OF A CONFLICT WITH. REPORTING TWO SETS OF INFORMATION ON TWO SEPARATE TIME FRAMES. AND THE FINAL PIECE OF THE RECEIPT AMENDMENTS ON IS -- THE REQUIREMENT REPORT ILLICIT MONIKERS THE COURTS DO CAPTURE THE INDIVIDUAL'S NAME IN CASE DATABASE BUT WE DON'T NOT TYPICALLY IN HAVE NOT THE PAST CAPTURED AT THE CASE ALIAS MONIKERS FOR THE INDIVIDUALS CHARGED IN THE CASE. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED. Q. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE OTHER ANY QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR MITCHELL YOU HAVE RELIED ON I DO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR OBSERVING THAT SIR THANK YOU OUT. OF THIS BONTA WOULD YOU CAN YOU RESPOND -- TO SOME OF THE OPPOSITION'S. INQUIRE USE AROUND NEEDING MORE CLARIFICATION ABOUT THE KIND OF DATA YOU'RE SEEKING. YES I CAN THANK YOU I AM IN I I APPRECIATE THAT THE POINTS THAT WERE MADE -- BUT BUT IN THE OPPOSITION WE'VE BEEN HAVING IN A DIALOGUE. THROUGH OUR COMMITTEES -- AT DEBATE -- ONE ANSWER THAT QUESTION AND ONE ANSWER MAYBE IF YOU DON'T MIND A COUPLE OTHER -- POINT MADE BY THE OPPOSITION BUT YOU THE A LOT OF THE DATA IS BEING COLLECTED NOW YES -- BUT THERE IS ADDITIONAL DATA -- AND YOU KNOW I I CAN READ A LIST HERE FROM THINGS LIKE THE DOCKET NUMBER WHAT THE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS A PUBLIC DEFENDER OR COURT APPOINTED COUNSEL. IF THERE'S A DISPOSITION OF DEFERRED ENTRY OF JUDGMENT A LOT OF SENTENCING DATA -- SUCH AS THE DATE OF SENSING THE SENTENCING TYPE LENGTH AND CONDITION -- ANYTIME CREDIT FOR TIME SERVED IN LIKE THAT CREDIT -- SO WE THINK THAT'LL IMPORT INFORMATION THE MORE DATA POINTS THE BETTER WE CAN UNDERSTAND OUR SYSTEM BETTER WE CAN STUDY IT -- YOU KNOW THE MORE DATA THERE IS THE MORE DATA POINTS THE MORE THE MORE THE SAVE THE DECISIONS IN THE FAIR THE DECISIONS THAT WE MAKE IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM SO. IT OUT WE ARE NOT -- SUGGESTING THAT ALL OF WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS IS NEW BUT SOME CRITICAL DATA POINTS ARE. AND I JUST SET FORTH A NUMBER OF THEM -- THERE IS ALSO A AB REPORTING REQUIREMENT FOR EVERY THIRTY DAYS WE THINK THAT'S FAR TOO LONG THE GOLD STANDARD SHOULD BE REAL TIME WE KNOW THAT THAT'S HARD WE'RE NOT READY TO GET THERE YET. SO WE FEEL AT APPROPRIATE COMPROMISES EVERY WEEK -- WITHIN THIRTY DAYS ALL SORTS OF THINGS CAN HAPPEN YOU CAN. HAVE A THAT YOU KNOW I BE CONVICTED OF A CRIME DISQUALIFIES YOU FROM OWNING A HANDGUN BUT BEFORE IT SUPPORTING GO GET A HANDGUN -- THIS SAME WITH SOME OF THAT COULD PUT YOU ON THE APPS PROHIBIT PERSONS LESS IT DOESN'T GET ENTERED -- SIMILARLY. BUT YOU KNOW YOU COULD HAVE A REST AND ARRESTED THAT A DISPOSITION. AND THAT COULD PREVENT YOU FROM GETTING A JOB OR OR OR HOUSING -- WHEN REALLY WAS DISMISSED AND HAZARDOUS BUT THE PUT IN THE RECORD YET? BUT IT'S ALL SORTS OF EXAMPLES I CAN SUGGEST YOU THAT ARE BOTH UNFAIR AND SAFE AND THIS BILL -- WHICH IS IN A BETTER DIRECTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL. OKAY THANK YOU -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- BONTA MAY I ASK YOUR WITNESSES OR THE OR THE ACT TO THE OPPOSING WITNESSES SOME QUESTIONS WERE QUICK. MR NEW BROUGH. UP IN THE WHAT KIND OF YOU USE THE TERM COURT TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS -- SO IS THAT A FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY WIDE. DATABASE THAT THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH. ALL COUNTIES IN THE STATE. SO HE GETS TO EACH COURSE HAS A CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM VOTE COLLEGE YEAH THAT'S CORRECT FIFTY COURTS HAVE. FIFTY CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS FOR THE MOST PART THERE'S ABOUT FIVE OF FIVE TO TEN DIFFERENT VENDORS A DIFFERENT SYSTEM THAT THEY USE INDIVIDUALLY. SO IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A ONE AND MAKE IT CLEAR IT'S NOT A CONFERENCE STATEWIDE DATABASE THAT FINAL INFORMATION AND A IN THE EXISTING CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS BUT THEY DO HAVE A SMALL NUMBER OF VENDORS THAT WE REACHED OUT TO TAKE KIND OF UNDERSTAND THE MODIFICATION OF THE NEED. FOR THIS BILL AND THAT'S WHERE IT CAME TO THE CONCERNED ABOUT WEALTH REALLY WE'RE JUST LOOKING FOR CLARITY ON THE PROGRAM VERSION THE COURTS TO COLLECT HER ONLY CONCERN IS A LISA MONIKERS. AND THEN WE'RE JUST LOOKING FOR SUCH ST CLARITY ON WHETHER IT'S DETECT CLARIFY THE EXISTING RECORDER APARTMENT OF THE THIRTY DAYS IF IT'S GOING TO BE MATCHED TO THIRTY DAYS ARE WE CLEAR HOW IT'S GONNA BE MEDICAL SORT OF CONFORM TO AB THIRTEEN THIRTY ONE PROPOSALS. FOR LIFE. SO WHEN WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP THIS DATABASE UP. ARE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT MR MR BUT WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT IN THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES OR WE'RE LOOKING AT A STATEWIDE SYSTEM. IT IT IT'S REPORTING FROM LOCAL FORTUNE AGENCIES WILL SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENTS AND AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS COURTS. TO A STATEWIDE SYSTEM AND RIGHT NOW. SOME OF THE REPORTING IS DONE IN HARD COPY. IT'S NOT EVEN ELECTRONIC -- SO WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT WE CAN HAVE A YOU KNOW A SINGLE PLATFORM OR A PLATFORM SECOND TALK TO EACH OTHER UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER. WHERE THE DATA IS -- YOU KNOW SENT ELECTRONICALLY WORD SEARCHABLE WE CAN -- IDENTIFY SPECIFIC PIECES OF IT THAT THAT ARE OF INTEREST AT THE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME -- THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL. SIXTY MANY CLARIFY IRA CONCERNS WOULD IT MAKE SURE SYSTEMS COULD SPEAK TO THE DOJ SYSTEMS ARE POOR THE DATA ACCURATELY TO MAKE A SINGLE SEVENTY WITH DATABASE ON TO CLARIFY THE WAS NO SINGLE STATEWIDE DATABASE RECORDS SYSTEMS OUTSIDE OF WHAT REPORTED THE ATTACK. AND AND MISS BACHELOR. WHAT IS IT LIKE FOR YOUR ORGANIZATION? FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT SYSTEMS -- AT WHAT ALSO LOCAL AGENCY EACH LOCAL AGENCY -- AT AS THE GENTLEMAN MENTIONED -- THEY ALSO HAVE VENDORS THAT THEY CONTRACT WITH -- AND THOSE VENDORS WILL COME AND TO IF OBVIOUSLY IF THIS BILL WERE TO BECOME LAW THEN DOES WHEN VENDORS WOULD HAVE TO COME IN. AND JUST DO A WITH THE EXISTING UP PROCEDURES AND ADD START. BRAND NEW WITH CASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM -- FOR THESE AGENCIES TO BE ABLE TO MEET THIS MANDATE AND OF COURSE THOSE ARE. THOSE HAVE HUGE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. AND ALSO NOT TO MENTION -- THAT STAFFING THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE ON A WEEKLY BASIS TO BE ABLE -- TO MEET THIS -- MANDATE TO RIGHT NOW YOU'RE USING HARD COPY IN EMAILS TO GET DATA. WELL SOME OBVIOUSLY SOME LOCAL AGENCIES ON THAT ARE SMALLER AND DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES YES AND THAT SOME -- ARE MUCH MORE UPDATED AND YOU KNOW DAY ODD THEY DO USE A MUCH MORE UPDATED THAT -- EQUIPMENT TO BE ABLE -- TO DO REGULAR CURRENTLY PARTING. SO WITH SO THIS IS SORT OF A BOTTOM UP PROPOSAL. WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT A TOP DOWN WHAT WE CAN TO GET UNIFORM? SO IT IS LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT I CAN A PHONE NUMBER ON MY CELLPHONE IT AUTOMATICALLY STORES AND I'M DONE I DON'T HAVE TO EMAIL SOMEONE -- YOU KNOW JUST IT WOULD GET BETTER I. T. LIKE I KNOW THAT THE DANGEROUS AREA CALIFORNIA BUT WHY ARE WE WHY ARE WE IMPOSING THIS ON MULTIPLE VENDORS WHEN WE MIGHT WANT TO START FROM THE TOP AND WORK FOR DOWN A REALLY GET THE WHOLE SYSTEM FOR ALL OF STATE. FIXED. A LOT OF THE DATA LIVES IN IN IN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND WITH COURT SO IT IF IT STAYS THERE IT DOESN'T GET REPORTED TO A CENTRAL CLARING HOUSE SO WE NEED THE REPORTING. THAT SO THAT IT DOES GO TO A STATEWIDE DATABASE -- AND THAT WE NEED -- BOMB PLATFORMS AND TECHSYSTEMS THAT SPEAK WITH ONE ANOTHER SO THAT THE INFORMATION CAN BE SHARED IT DOES UNFORTUNATELY. REQUIRE SHARING IT THE DOJ HAD ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION ON ITS OWN INDEPENDENT FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN COURTS THIS WOULD BE NECESSARY BUT THIS IS ABOUT SHARING INFORMATION ACROSS JURISDICTIONS SO THAT WHEN AND AND THE DECISION ABOUT AN INDIVIDUAL THE CAMANCHE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS MADE. ALL DATA COMES TO BEAR ON THAT INDIVIDUAL AND THE DECISION BEING MADE IS AVAILABLE TO THE DECISION MAKER SO THAT I CAN BE FAIR. AND SAFE -- WORK WE'RE DEFINITELY -- THE ARE BILLED AS A DETAIL ALL THAT YOU KNOW DOESN'T IDENTIFY SPECIFIC PLATFORM -- AND WE WANT TO CREATE SOME FLEXIBILITY SO THAT -- THAT THERE COULD BE DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT WERE AFFORDABLE AND MADE SENSE. BUT IF THEY DO NEED TO SPEAK WITH ONE ANOTHER SO THAT SO THE DATA CAN BECOME A JUSTICE DATA CAN BE SHARED. IT MAY MAY. THANK YOU -- SO I WOULD SAY THAT WHILE IT MAY SOUND IDEAL TO HAVE ONE CENTRALIZED SYSTEM FOR ENTIRE STATE I THINK THAT ACTUALLY THERE IS SORT OF UP. THERE THAT CREATES ITS OWN ROADBLOCKS NOT ONLY WOULD IT BE POTENTIALLY VERY EXPENSIVE -- BUT SOMETIMES HAVING ONE BIG SYSTEM IT CAN KIND OF TRAP YOU MORE THAN THAT INNOVATION THAT YOU CAN THAT CAN ARISE FROM HAVING MANY SYSTEMS. THAT MAY SOUND BETTER TO HAVE ONE BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT ACTUALLY IS BETTER IN THE MODERN TECHNOLOGICAL ERA AND I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT TECHNOLOGY HAS ADVANCED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT WE DON'T ALL NEED TO HAVE THE SAME SYSTEM. FOR OUR SYSTEMS TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY -- I THINK THAT THE EXAMPLE OF THAT FIVE TO TEN VENDORS ACROSS THE STATE ALL OF THOSE VENDORS ARE ABSOLUTELY CAPABLE OF MAKING MODIFICATIONS TO THEIR SYSTEM TO THEN REPORT FROM EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE COUNTY COURTS DIRECTLY TO THE STATE. I'M IN THE SAME WOULD BE TRUE FOR ANY RECORDS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. I'M IN A LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IN THERE'S BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE WIDE INITIATIVES TO ADVANCE THAT KIND OF THAT DATA SHARING THAT ALLOWS US TO HAVE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES THAT ESSENTIALLY SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE AND SO WE KIND OF GET. TO A WE GET TO THE TOP APPROACH WHERE WE HAVE CENTRALIZED DATA COUNTIES AND AGENCIES TO HAVE SYSTEMS THAT WORK BETTER FOR THEM ON THE GROUND. GREAT THANK YOU I DOES COUNTY SUPERVISOR WE AD A SURE IF THAT HAD THE ABILITY TO GET TO A DATABASE I WAS NATIONAL. WAS KIND OF REMARKABLE WHAT YOU COULD DO TO FIGHT CRIME YOU KNOW THERE'S A WHITE VAN FROM MINNESOTA. IN FRONT OF THIS BUILDING IN A WORLD THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THIS BAND HAS BEEN AT THE FOLLOWING. CRIME SCENES IN ARIZONA AND YADA YADA. SO THINGS CAN BE DONE RATHER RATHER QUICKLY I THANK YOU THANK YOU WERE TESTIFYING DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. DO I HAVE I HAVE A MOTION MADAM CLERK WHEN WE TAKE THE ROLE THE VEHICLES. ARE YOU I DID FEEL TO IT BUT HE WAS BUSY ON A SPONSOR. HE WAS TEXTING STATED NEED TO CLOSE. TO THE RIGHT OF HIS FATHER WAS POSSIBLE CANETTI AND AND THE CHAIR OF COURSE -- NOT JUST THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY I I THINK -- A FAIR AND SAFE HELLO JUSTICE SYSTEM RELIES ON THAT SOUND ACCURATE COMPREHENSIVE DATA THIS BILL SEEKS. TO HAVE A PROVIDE THAT DATA THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER. MORLOCK I MORE LIKE AYE BRADFORD. JACKSON MITCHELL. MITCHELL ARM AROUND WIENER. KIDS TWO ONE AND IT'S ON CALL THANK YOU AS A MEMBER BONTA FOR YOUR THREE BILLS HAVE A GREAT DAY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU COLLEAGUES THANK YOU STAFF. THAT TAKES US TO THE WORLD FAMOUS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN. KEEP UP -- WILL KEEP UP SENATOR MITCHELL KEEP UP. WELCOME THIS IS IT ASSEMBLY BILL. FIVE TWENTY ONE THANK YOU THE CHAIR AND SENATORS. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AB FIVE TWENTY ONE TODAY. THIS BILL WOULD TASK THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FIREARM VIOLENCE RESEARCH CENTER WITH DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING TRAINING PROGRAMS AND EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ON REDUCING THE RISK. OF FIREARM RELATED HARM AMONG PATIENTS. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION REPORTED THREE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY FOUR FIREARM RELATED DEATHS IN CALIFORNIA. ROUGHLY HALF OF WHICH WERE SUICIDES AND THE OTHER HALF HOMICIDE. FURTHERMORE AND MASS SHOOTINGS ARE CHANGING THE CHARACTER OF PUBLIC LIFE IN THE STATE. JUST LAST NOVEMBER. A MASS SHOOTING AT BORDERLINE BAR AND GRILL IN THOUSAND OAKS CALIFORNIA RESULT RESULTED IN TWELVE DEATH. LAST YEAR THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS PUBLISHED A POSITION PAPER THAT RECOMMENDS A PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACH O FIREARMS RELATED VIOLENCE. IN THE PREVENTION OF FIREARM INJURIES AND DEATHS. WHILE MANY HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS RECOGNIZE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP PREVENT FIREARM RELATED INJURY AND DEATH. MANY CITE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE REGARDING WHEN AND HOW TO COUNSEL PATIENTS AS A PRINCIPAL BARRIER TO ACTION. THE POSITION STATEMENT ADOPTED BY THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN STATED THAT EXPANDED EDUCATION AND TRAINING ARE NEEDED TO IMPROVE CLINICIAN FAMILIARITY WITH THE BENEFITS AND RISKS OF FIREARM OWNERSHIP. SAFETY PRACTICES IN COMMUNICATION WITH PATIENTS ABOUT FARM VIOLENCE. AB FIVE TWENTY ONE RECOGNIZES THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO HELP PREVENT FIREARM RELATED HARLEM. AND AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FIRE ON VIOLENCE RESEARCH CENTER IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO EQUIP THEM WITH THE EDUCATION. TRAINING AND RESOURCES NEEDED TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS AT RISK FOR SUCH HARM. PROVIDE EVIDENCE BASED COUNSELING TO MITIGATE RISK IN INTERVENE IN SITUATIONS OF IMMINENT DANGER. I WAS ABLE TO SECURE FUNDING IN THE BUDGET FOR THIS EFFORT. IN AB FIVE TWENTY ONE WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO THE CENTER AS TO HOW THE FUNDING SHALL BE USED. WITH ME TODAY IS DOCTOR DEAR AND WHAT I MEAN THE DIRECTOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FARM VIOLENCE RESEARCH CENTER. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE [inaudible] WELCOME. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS TO ME GOOD MORNING AND THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY I'LL I'LL BE BRIEF AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN MENTIONED -- THERE ARE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE DYING FROM FIREARM RELATED INJURIES IN CALIFORNIA EVERY YEAR ONLY TEXAS HAS MORE SUCH DEATHS THAN. WE DO ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND AS A CLINICIAN IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE. TO RECOGNIZE THAT NATION WIDE 75% OF THE PEOPLE WHO DIE FROM GUNSHOT WOUNDS DIE WHERE THEY ARE SHOT. FROM MONSTER ESSENTIALLY NOT SURVIVABLE SO OUR INTEREST IN PREVENTION. IS AS STRONG AND LEGITIMATE AS IS OUR INTEREST IN PREVENTION FOR OTHER MAJOR CAUSES OF DEATH CANCER HEART DISEASE AND SO FORTH. AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER HAS OUTLINED THERE'S BEEN A SURGE OF INTEREST AMONG HEALTH PROFESSIONALS GENERALLY IN GETTING OFF THE SIDELINES AD MAKING A DIFFERENCE HERE THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. IN THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS TO FIX THAT PROBLEM. THE SURGE OF INTEREST IS NOT JUST A MOM HEALTH PROFESSIONALS OUR OUR RESEARCH CENTER RECENTLY DID A STATEWIDE SURVEY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND FOUND THAT 90% OF THE GENERAL POPULATION AND 80% OF FIREARM OWNERS IN CALIFORNIA SUPPORT COUNSELING OF FIREARM OWNERS BY HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHEN. RISK IS ELEVATED AND ALL AND I'M JUST WITHOUT A QUICK POINT ABOUT ABOUT THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THIS IS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER. MENTIONED. THERE IS AN APPROPRIATION IN THE CURRENT BUDGET THREE POINT EIGHT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS. THE MEDICAL CARE COSTS ALONE OF FIREARM INJURIES IN CALIFORNIA WERE RECENTLY ESTIMATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT IT HAD ONE HUNDRED TEN MILLION DOLLARS. PER YEAR AND THE MEDICAL CARE COSTS ARE A VERY SMALL PORTION OF THE COST OF FIREARM VIOLENCE GENERALLY. IF WE AGGREGATE THE ENTIRE COST THE COST PER DEBT FROM FIREARM VIOLENCE OR BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A PIECE. PREVENTING A SMALL NUMBER OF THESE DEATHS WERE NON FATAL INJURIES WOULD ENTIRELY OFFSET THE COST OF THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

I'LL DEFER TO THE DIRECTOR FOR THE CORE MISSION I KNOW WHAT MY BILL WANTS TO DO BUT I CAN'T TALK TO THE CORE MISSION OF THE CENTER -- TECHNICIAN IS ACTUALLY OUTLINED IN IN STATUTE IN THE THERE ARE PROVISIONS OF THE PENAL CODE WHICH OUTLINED AT THE PRIMARY MISSION OF THE CENTER IS CONFUSED TO CONDUCT RESEARCH WHICH IS. CAN BE BASIC CORE EPIDEMIOLOGIC WERE TRANSLATIONAL WE ALSO TRAIN NEW INVESTIGATORS IN THE CONDUCT OF THIS. RESEARCH WE WORK ACTIVELY TO GET THE RESULTS OF OUR RESEARCH OUT TO THE PUBLIC WE ARE A PUBLIC FACING INSTITUTION OUR MISSION. IS TO IDENTIFY EVIDENCE AND AND BRING IT FORWARD WE WORK ON A REGULAR BASIS WITH POLICY MAKERS BECAUSE WE HOPE THAT THE EVIDENCE WE UNCOVER WILL HELP INFORM THE POLICY MAKING PROCESS. SO YOU DIDN'T INCLUDE TRAINING AND EDUCATION SERVICES I AGAIN I'M SORRY BUT JUSTICE BESET SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS SHOULDN'T. TALK ABOUT GOING OUT TO MEDICAL. PROFESSIONALS I'M KIND OF CURIOUS REALLY APART EVERY DRIFTING A LITTLE OR WE EXPANDING. GET A TAKE JUST A SECOND TO PERHAPS AT STAGE -- OUR ORIGINAL TRAINING AND EDUCATION MISSION HAD TO DO WITH TRAINING AND EDUCATING RESEARCHERS. THAT LANGUAGE WAS DRAFTED SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND IN THE INTERVENING TIME IT'S IT'S BECOME CLEAR THAT THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL ELEMENT TO WHAT I WOULD SEE AS PART OF OUR CORE MISSION. THAT WOULD BE VERY VALUABLE TO THE STATE AND DIRECTLY TO THE NATION AND ITS. TO SPECIFY THETERMS OF THAT ADDITIONAL ELEMENT THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN DRAFTED THE LEGISLATION THAT'S BEFORE YOU SO THIS I DO NOT SEE THIS IS MISSION CREEP TO BE HONEST. I SEE THIS IS SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DIDN'T SPECIFY THE FIRST TIME. AND SO WHEN I'M THINKING OF MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS -- PSYCHIATRISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS COME TO MIND AS IT RELATES TO MAYBE. YOU KNOW MENTAL ILLNESS YES AND FIREARMS YES IN INDIA BUT I'M JUST WONDERING WHY THE ENTIRE SPECTRUM SO I USE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO LIBERALLY I AM A CLINICIAN I DIE. MY LAST SHIFT IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WAS LAST SATURDAY I TOOK CARE OF SOMEBODY WHO IS THERE FOR SICK CALL I HAVE -- GUNSHOT WOUND -- SO I I KNOW AS A CLINICIAN THAT A WIDE ARRAY OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY HERE -- PHYSICIANS TO OF ALL SORTS IN PRIMARY CARE -- IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS IN TRAUMA SURGEONS BUT BUT ABSOLUTELY MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ALTHOUGH TO BE HONEST. THEIR ROLE IS PROBABLY LESS THAN IT COM IT IS COMMONLY THOUGHT TO BE MENTAL ILLNESS PLAYS A MUCH SMALLER ROLE IN FIREARM VIOLENCE THEN IT IS. COMMONLY THOUGHT TO DO -- AND ALONG WITH IF IF I CAN REFER TO THEM THIS WY AND THAT SORT OF TOP OF THE PYRAMID PROFESSIONALS THERE ARE NURSES AND SOCIAL SERVICE. IN THE SOCIAL SERVICE WORKERS WE HOPE HEARD FROM A REPRESENTATIVE OF OF SOCIAL WORKERS JUST A MOMENT AGO. PART OF WHAT MAKES THIS EXCITING FOR US FRANKLY IS THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS WHO WORK OR NARAL WHO WORK ALREADY IS A TEAM SAYING WE WANT TO WE WANT A PIECE OF THIS PROBLEM WE WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO THE INTENT HERE IS TO FIX THAT PART OF THE PROBLEM. RIGHT THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. YOU'RE WELCOME BACK -- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE'VE ALREADY GOTTEN THE ALL THE WITNESSES [inaudible] OKAY -- APPRECIATE THE BILL -- WE KNOW THAT. THE LARGEST PERCENT OF DEATHS BY -- WITH. FIRE ARMS IS SUICIDE. SO CLEARLY THERE'S A CLEAR. MEDICAL CONNECTION THERE BUT I THINK THERE'S ADDITIONALLY -- WHETHER IT'S A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENTS OR OTHER TYPES OF INTO INCIDENTS -- AFTER WOMEN YOU REFERENCE. THE ISSUE OF OF HAVING BEEN IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. THERE ARE SOME GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS THAT LITERALLY THEY'RE NOT MEDICAL BUT THEY LITERALLY. WORK IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM AREA BECAUSE ANOTHER LARGE FACTOR. IN GUN VIOLENCE DEATHS ARE REVENGE SHOOTINGS AND SO VERY CALMLY. WHEN A VICTIM OF A GUNSHOT WOUND COMES THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS ARE THERE? THE THEIR MEDIA IT'S OUR DESIRE IS GET BACK AT WEBER -- WHOEVER WHOEVER'S AFFILIATED WITH THE PERSON THAT MAY HAVE SHOT THEIR LOVED. ONE AND DASH SO THERE'S BEEN INTERVENTIONS -- THAT HAVE SOME RESEARCH INDICATES VERY VERY EFFECTIVE TO TRY. TO BRING DOWN THAT THOSE REACTIONS AND SUPPORT AND ASSIST THE VICTIM IN THE FAMILY MEMBER SO THAT. THERE ISN'T THEN IMMEDIATELY A REVENGE SHOOTING SO. I DON'T KNOW IF THE TRAINING YOU'RE LOOKING OUT WOULD INCLUDE ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT CERTAINLY THERE SIR THE VERY LIMITED RESEARCH I'VE SHOWN INDICATES THAT IT'S PRETTY EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION. ANYWAY YEAH MY UNDERSTANDING IS IT A WOOD AND THE OTHER OTHER EXAMPLES ARE YOU KNOW IF IF YEAH COUPLE COMES IN IN THE GONNA START A FAMILY. AND IT IS GOING TO KIDS IN THE HOUSE TO TALK ABOUT HOW BEST TO IT ONE OF THE BEST PRACTICES FOR KEEPING YOUR FIREARMS SAFE -- IN A HOUSE WITH YOUNG KIDS AND AND HOW YOU KNOW THAT MIGHT CHANGE THE DYNAMIC DYNAMICS AT HOME AND AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE BEST. PRACTICES IN PLACE BECAUSE WE READ STORIES TOO OFTEN ABOUT. SH BABIES GETTING ACTUALLY YOUNG CHILDREN GETTING ACCESS TO HANDGUNS THAT THEY SHOULDN'T OF AND AND SHOOTING THEMSELVES OR OTHERS -- SO THERE'S ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT EXAMPLES WHERE THIS IS AN ABOUT TAKING PEOPLE'S GUNS AWAY IT'S JUST ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT RISKS AS LIKE CHANGES -- AND USING BEST PRACTICES IN THE HOUSE TO TO TRY TO MITIGATE AS MUCH RISK AS POSSIBLE. RIGHT SO YOU MAY CLOSE THAT IS IT OKAY DON. I'M LET ME SEE IF THERE'S A MOTION. WE MAY HAVE TO WAIT ON A MOTION GOTCHA -- BUT DON'T WORRY MY COLLEAGUES WILL WRITE. HAS BOUNDARIES RIGHT MY COLLEAGUES WILL RETURN. AND WE CAN ENTERTAIN THAT MOTION. I THINK THAT WAS YOUR ONLY BILL YES RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU SIR MY SENATORS CERTAINLY.

PROVIDES TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO REDUCE STREET VIOLENCE AND CITIES SUCH AS OAKLAND SACRAMENTO STOCKTON AND CHICAGO.

WE ASK YOU TO PLEASE HELP BUILD HEALTHIER AND STRONGER COMMUNITIES BY VOTING YES ON ASSEMBLY BILL SIX FIFTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS A GOOD MORNING WHEN IS THE US MY NAME'S ISRAEL VIA I'M THE POP PROGRAMMING PARTY CORNER WITH ME FIVE MORE OF AN INDIVIDUAL LEADERSHIP FOR PUBLIC ADVANCEMENT. WHICH IS A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION SALINAS CALIFORNIA -- I GREW UP IN THE SALINAS OFTEN ALL WE HAD WAS A SUPPORT WE PROVIDED EACH OTHER. THE COMMUNITY CONDITIONS POVERTY VIOLENCE AND DESPAIR THAT GOES ALONG WITH THAT WAS OVERWHELMING FOR ME AS A CHILD. AT AN EARLY AGE I SUCCUMB TO THE PRESSURES OF VIOLENCE AS A RESULT I WAS INCARCERATED ON AND OFF FOR EIGHTEEN OF MY FORTY ONE YEARS. THERE WAS ALWAYS A WELL RESOURCE AND COORDINATOR APPROACH TO MY PUNISHMENT INCARCERATION BUT NEVER FOR HEALING INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION. IMAGINE IF DEAF DECADES AGO CALIFORNIA HAD INVESTED IN A COORDINATED APPROACH THAT FOCUSED ON PREVENTING VIOLENCE. HEALING UNDERLYING TRAUMA AND SUPPORT OF INTERVENTIONS FOR PEOPLE CAUSING HARM. THAT WAS NOT THE DECISION THAT CALIFORNIA MADE BACK THEN BUT IS A DECISION WE CAN MAKE TODAY. THE MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF MULTI GENERATIONAL VIOLENCE AND TRAUMA I LEARNED THAT THE CYCLES OF VIOLENCE CAN BE EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSED THE COMMUNITY BASE PREVENTIONS. AT ME BUT WE WORK WITH YOU YOUTH AND ADULT TO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE AND SOME WHO HAVE CAUSED HARM. AND WE USE CULTURE ROOTED PRACTICES TO FOSTER HEALING AND INVEST IN THEIR LEADERSHIP AND STRENGTH. THIS APPROACH IS WORKING IN SALINAS IT'S ALSO WORKING ORIGINAL WERE HOMICIDE IS DOWN BY 50% BECAUSE OF COMMUNITY BASED VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS. IT'S WORKING ALL THE PLACES WERE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY VIOLENCE. HAVE STEPPED UP TO BUILD SAFER NEIGHBORHOODS. WE KNOW HOW TO BUILD REAL SAFETY WE'RE DOING IT EVERY DAY BUT THESE EFFORTS ARE NOT CORE NEED ACROSS THE STATE AND THEY ARE NOT PROPERLY FUNDED. WITHOUT A STATEWIDE PLAN AND HOME PROVIDERS PREVENTION HEALING OUR EFFORTS ARE LIMITED AND ISOLATED AND WE'RE NT ABLE TO BILL TOGETHER AND COORDINATED FOR EVEN GREATER IMPACT. CALIFORNIA NEEDS AN OFFICE OF HELPING SAVE COMMUNITIES BY HAVING A DEDICATED OFFICE WE CAN BRING TOGETHER PEOPLE PRACTICES AND RESOURCES UNDER ONE ROOF AND FINALLY CREATE THE STATEWIDE PLAN AND VISION. THAT WILL ALLOW HEALTH AND SAFETY TO FLOURISH. CALIFORNIA'S NEW SURGEON GENERAL PEDIATRICIAN DOCTOR NADINE BURKE CARROT STATES UNLESS YOU FIX THE TRAUMA THE WHOLE IN THE SOUL.

CENTER MORE LIKE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SOME NUMBER -- SEE I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS -- WHAT'S THE VISION FOR STAFFING AND FULL TIME EMPLOYEES AND I KNOW THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATIONS BUGS CURIOUS. ABOUT WHAT YOU ANTICIPATE COST MIGHT BE. VISIT IN THE STAFF REPORT AND I DON'T BELIEVE IS FOR THE COST. IS -- IN THE ANALYSIS -- I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S IN THE ANALYSIS HOWEVER DOES HAVE A BREAKDOWN OF WHAT -- THE OFFICE -- FRAMEWORK WOULD LOOK LIKE AS WELL AS AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT'S ON PAGE -- FARM ARMY ON THE RUN. AROUND YOUR HEAD. I'M ON THE WRONG TAP I'M LOOKING IN THE WRONG REPORT I APOLOGIZE. THIS IS A STAFF TEAM. AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE BUT IT DOESN'T PROVIDE ANY DETAILS. FIVE TEN TWENTY HUNDREDS. WE ARE LOOKING AT HIGHER NAY -- STAFF TEAM PUT THAT [inaudible] OF DIRECTOR. AND AN ADVISER. AND THEN WE HAVE A BREAK DOWN. OF AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE MADE UP OF OF VARIOUS -- COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS -- FROM UNIVERSITIES A MEMBERS OF THE PART IN A PUBLIC HEALTH -- INEQUITY. STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL -- NUMBER OF OUR LAST -- PRISONERS -- SEVEN MEMBER BERMAN WAS ABLE TO GET FUNDING IN THE BUDGET FOR HIS PROPOSAL WERE YOU ABLE TO DO THE SAME. NOT SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS PROPOSAL HOWEVER THERE IS MONEY DEDICATED FOR THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS. AND SO THEN WHY HASN'T THE THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND JUST TURNED IT ON ITS OWN. THE ACTUAL -- THIS TYPE OF UP WORK IS ALREADY TAKING PLACE UNDER THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. AND I FIGURE ANALYSIS -- HIGHLIGHTS THAT. SPECIFICALLY THE CALVET PROGRAM GROWLED VIOLENCE WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS LOOK AT THIS ISSUE THROUGH THE LENS OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND UNDER THE US SURGEON GENERAL WE BELIEVE -- AND THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS WHERE AT LEAST TYPES OF COORDINATED EFFORTS ARE TO BE A TAKING PLACE. SO -- EMERGENCY OFFICE -- ALREADY DOES. SOME OF THIS WORK. BUT IT ISN'T A FULLY COORDINATED. SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS CONSOLIDATED. EFFORT TAKES PLACE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. CERTAINLY -- OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS [inaudible] ON IS THERE A MOTION FOR AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA'S BILL. THANK YOU -- BEFORE I ASK YOU TO CLOSE THE THE MANY OF THE SUCCESSES THAT WERE CITED. ARM LIKE CITY OF RICHMOND OTHERS HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING FROM OUR ON CALVET PROGRAM AND WE DID IN THIS LAST BUDGET. INCREASE THE FUNDING AVAILABLE TO CALVET. BUT I THINK IN THERE WITH COULD BE AN ARGUMENT THAT THIS WE HAVE AN EXISTING PROGRAM SO I CREATE ANOTHER -- ONE I'M SUPPORT OF YOUR BILL BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE HAVE -- COME TO UNDERSTAND WHICH WERE CLEARLY IS THAT GUN VIOLENCE IS NOT PRIMARILY A CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUE. IT IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. NOT SOLELY IN ONLY BUT AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN APPROACH IT FROM THAT PUBLIC HEALTH POINT OF VIEW. PERHAPS WE CAN GET AT EITHER THE ROUTE OR YOU KNOW [inaudible] HELP THE START TURNING AROUND. THE STATISTICS -- IN WAYS THAT JUST GOING THROUGH THE LENS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE MIGHT NOT KNOW WHILE THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IS NOT NECESSARILY A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICE -- IT IS MUCH MORE IT'S JUST ORIENTED AND NOT THAT THE FUNDING THAT WE'VE PROVIDED UNDER CALVET THIS NECESSARILY BEEN ORIENTED THIS WAY BUT IS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS. THE REACTION TO A THING AFTER IT OCCURS OR VERSUS THAT PREVENTION SO. I THINK THIS IS A PUTTING SOMETHING LIKE THIS IN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. IS MUCH MORE REFLECTIVE OF OUR BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE ROOT CAUSES OF GUN VIOLENCE AND WILL I THINK IMPROVE OUR ABILITIES TO PREVENT IT. AND WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SEE WHETHER A REST THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION AGREES OR NOT. SO -- WE HAVE A MOTION WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I'LL TAKE THAT AS OF MY MY CLOSING COMMENTS MANAGER THANK YOU -- LET'S DO A ROLL CALL THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS SKINNER. HI SKINNER I'M MORE LOCK. BRADFORD ON BRADFORD AYE JACKSON MITCHELL. MORALE NO AROUND THAT WIENER. WIENER AYE. BILLS ON CALL -- THANKS SO MUCH.

AND HAVE THE RIGHT TO REGISTER TO VOTE -- CURRENT LAW REQUIRES STATE AND LOCAL. JUVENILE DETENTION FACILITIES TO ASSIST IN VOTER REGISTRATION FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE OF AGE AND ARE NOT SERVING A FELONY SENTENCE. THIS BILL WOULD AN ACT SIMILAR PROVISIONS OF FOR ADULTS BY REQUIRING EACH OF US EACH COUNTY JAIL TO ALLOW AT LEAST AT LEAST ONE ORGANIZATION TO PROVIDE.

AB SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN WILL HELP CALIFORNIANS IN COUNTY JAILS OVERCOME THESE BURDENS EVER CRYING SHARES TO ALLOW ORGANIZATIONS TO CONDUCT IN PERSON VOTER REGISTRATION ACTIVITIES. THIS WILL ADD VOTER REGISTRATION TO THE ALREADY DIVERSE RANGE OF PROGRAMMING THAT COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDING COUNTY JAILS FROM LEGAL EDUCATION AND SOBRIETY SUPPORT TO RELIGIOUS SERVICES AND LEGAL AID. AS WITH THESE OTHER VOLUNTEER PROGRAM SHERIFF'S RETAIN THE RIGHT TO DENY CLEARANCE TO INDIVIDUALS.

ON THAT PERHAPS LA COUNTY IS DOING -- SOMETHING THAT MAY NOT WORK FOR OTHER JAILS -- SO ON FAITH BASED ON THAT -- BUT WE RESPECTFULLY OUT OPPOSE THE BILL ALSO -- JUST -- THE BULLET POINTS ARE MADE IN THE ANALYSIS SOME OF THE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO BE DONE BY THE SHERIFF. IN EACH COUNTY ON BASICALLY HAVING -- IF STAY. DENY AN ORGANIZATION OR INDIVIDUAL FROM COMING INTO THE THROUGH THEIR JAIL. THERE ARE GOING TO HAVE -- TO LET THE PERSON KNOW WHY THE DENIAL IS SO. THEN OF COURSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO ALLOW THE PERSON TO APPEAL -- THE DENIAL AND THEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND LET THE PELL PERSON NO AND THAT.

CAN SEVENTY SIX WOULD REALLY ALTER AND CHANGE THE LIVES FOR MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO EITHER. HAVE AN ARREST RECORD OR HAVE A CONVICTION THAT IS ALLOWED TO BE EXPUNGED. UNFORTUNATELY OUR GOVERNMENT HASN'T REALLY STREAMLINED THIS PROCESS WE HAVE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE THE ABILITY TO CLEAR THEIR RECORDS. WHO HAVEN'T YET PARTLY BECAUSE THE COST PER BECAUSE THE TIME PARTLY BECAUSE THE DIFFICULTY OF GOING TO DO THAT? WE'RE PROPOSING A STREAMLINED APPROACH ON HOW TO DO THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. THEY ARE WILLING TO DEVELOP A DATABASE. THAT CAN BE SHARED WITH THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. THAT DATABASE THEN CAN BE USED TO NOT RELEASE INFORMATION WHEN EACH OF THOSE COUNTIES ARE ONTACTED. WE THINK THIS IS A MUCH MORE STREAMLINED AS WELL AS A CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE FOR US. AND BY DOING SO WE EXPECT THAT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WILL HAVE THEIR RECORDS ACTUALLY CLEARED. THAT CAN PAVE THE WAY FOR TOWARDS BETTER EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS OUSE INTERPRETERS WITHOUT LET ME TURN OVER. TO ONE OF OUR MAIN SPONSORS DISTRICT ATTORNEY GEORGE GAS GONE FROM CITY COUNTY SAN FRANCISCO. THANK YOU. OUR TEN ON AND THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS TODAY THIS IS REALLY ABOUT HUMAN DIGNITY. OF THE LAWS ALREADY THERE WE'RE NOT WRITING ANY NEW LAW PER SE THIS IS A RELIEF THE PEOPLE QUALIFY FOR UNFORTUNATELY. LESS THAN 6% OF CALIFORNIANS ACTUALLY AVAILED HIMSELF OF THOSE RELIEF. PRIMARILY BECAUSE THEY IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO DO THERE ARE SO MANY HOOPS OF PEOPLE HAVE TO JUMP THROUGH IT IS EXPENSIVE. ALL IN CONSEQUENTLY THE PEOPLE THAT CAN LEAST AFFORD TO HAVE A CRIMINAL RECORD PEOPLE ARE MOST IMPACTED BY THIS SO. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE X. SYSTEM RELIEF IT HAS BEEN PROVIDER READY BY THE LEGISLATORS IN THE STATE? AND MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE GET THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS IS A IS A REALLY OF ALL. COMMUNITY SAFETY THIS IS OF ALL FURNACES OF ALL HUMAN DIGNITY. IS ALL PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO GET HOUSING YOU KNOW TO GET EMPLOYMENT BEING ABLE TO EVEN PARTICIPATE.

DOING THIS MULTIPLE TIMES OF THE COURSE OF A FEW MONTHS I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY THAT HAVE THAT TYPE OF FLEXIBILITY WHILE WORKING FULL TIME AND THE KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL. IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT ONLY 6% OF THOSE AMERICANS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR EXPUNGEMENT ACTUALLY GET IT. PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PAYING THEIR LIGHT BILL. AND PAY FOR AN EXPUNGEMENT.

WIENER RIGHT WIENER AYE EXCELLENT THOSE ARE ALL ON CALL BUT AT LEAST WE GOT THEM. GOING SO LET'S GO TO ITEM NINETEEN SB SIXTEEN HUNDRED WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE OPPORTUNITY PERCENT THIS BILL FOR YOU TODAY THIS BILL. WOULD MAKE TWO CHANGES TO EXISTING PITCHES MOTION PROCEDURES TO ENSURE GREATER AND GREATER ACCESS TO DUE PROCESS. AND THE RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL FOR PERSONS CHARGED WITH CRIMES. SPECIFICALLY FOR NEVER TO BRING PITCHES MOTION TIME LINES INTO ALIGNMENT WITH REGULAR COMEAU DISTURBING NOTICE TIMELINES. AB SIX SIXTEEN HUNDRED WOULD AMEND THE EVIDENCE CODE TO ALIGN THE TIME PERIOD OF PITCHES DISCOVERY MOTIONS WITH THE NOTICE PERIOD FOR DISCOVERY MOTIONS IN CRIMINAL CASES. SIXTEEN DAYS TEN DAYS. AS YOU MAY KNOW A SPEEDY TRIAL IS LIMITED TO THIRTY DAYS A MISDEMEANOR CASES AND SIXTY DAYS FOR A FELONY CASE. THE SIX DAY DIFFERENCE MAY SEEM INCONSEQUENTIAL BUT IT AMOUNTS TO A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF A PERSON'S LEGAL ABILITY TO PROVE THEIR INNOCENCE. BY ALIGNING THIS TIMELINE TO THE SAME DISCOVERY TIMELINES AFFORDED FOR OTHER DISCOVERY TIME LINES WILL HELP TO BALANCE RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS WITH THE RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL. AS A FORMER DEPUTY PUBLIC DEFENDER OF EXPERIENCE FIRST HAND THE CHALLENGE OF PURSUING A TIME NOT WAIVE A JURY TRIAL. OUR MY CLIENT HAD TO WE THEIR RIGHTS TO SPEECH TRIAL AGAINST HIS OR HER RIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS. ONE SHOULD NOT BE SACRIFICE IN LIEU OF THE OTHER. SECONDLY WOULD ALSO REPEAL RESTRICTIONS EXEMPTING SUPERVISING OFFICERS IN THE DISCLOSURE RECORDS THROUGH A PITCHES MOTION FOR THE PRIOR MISCONDUCT WHEN IT IS PERTINENT. TO DEFEND HIS RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS CURRENT LAW RESTRICTS THE ABILITY FOR SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL OFFICERS TO BE SUBJECT TO A PITCHES MOTION. EVEN IF THAT PERSON WAS INVOLVED IN DIRECTING OR OVERSEEING THE CONDUCT IN QUESTION. A WORK CLOSELY WITH PORAC THE PEACE OFFICERS RESEARCH ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA ON THIS LAST REVISION AND HAVE DROPPED TO NEARLY. ZERO TWO LANGUAGE THAT WAS RECENTLY AMENDED INTO THE BILL TO ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND AS OF AS A RESULT THEY REMOVED THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. BUT MAKING THESE MODEST CHANGES CALIFORNIA CAN MAKE PITCHES PROCEDURES LESS BURDENSOME AND TIME CONSUMING WHILE INCREASING FAIRNESS IN CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. BRITNEY SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OUR SUSAN LEFT THE COMPANY PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. AND KATHLEEN GOING RIGHT NOW WITH THE ACLU [inaudible] GO AHEAD. MORNING MY NAME IS TO THE LEFT I AM THE ASSISTANT PUBLIC DEFENDER OF NEVADA COUNTY. WHERE I SERVICE THE MISDEMEANOR SUPERVISOR? TODAY I'M HERE TO SHARE WHY THE FIRST PART OF THIS BILL WILL MAKE AN IMPORTANT CHANGE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND THEN WHEN I'M DONE KATHLEEN FROM THE ACLU WILL ADDRESS THE SECOND PORTION OF THE BILL. CURRENT LAW CAUSES THOSE CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANORS TO HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ON THE ONE HAND AFFIRMING THEIR RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL OR ON THE OTHER HAND. ASKING COURTS TO PROVIDE RELEVANT INFORMATION REGARDING A POLICE OFFICERS PRIOR ACTS OF MISCONDUCT. THAT MISCONDUCT EVIDENCE IS A CONFIDENTIAL BECAUSE IT'S CONTAINED WITHIN THE POLICE OFFICERS FILE. IT MAY ONLY BE THE ONLY EVIDENCE AVAILABLE TO CORROBORATE A PERSON'S CLAIM OF INNOCENCE OR A CLAIM THAT THE POLICE OFFICER VIOLATED THAT PERSON'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. A DEFENSE ATTORNEY CAN SEEK INFORMATION REGARDING WHETHER AN OFFICER HAS DONE SIMILAR THINGS IN THE PAST INCLUDING FABRICATING EVIDENCE USING EXCESSIVE FORCE OR VIOLATING A PERSON'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. THEY DO SO BY FILING A MOTION FOR DISCOVERY CALLED THE PITCHES pMOTION THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY NEEDS TO BE VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT INFORMATION IS BEING REQUESTED AND WHY IT'S IMPORTANT. IN MY OWN EXPERIENCE I'VE SEEN THAT THE RESULT OF A SUCCESSFUL PITCHES MOTION CAN BECAUSE THE PROSECUTION TO DISMISS THE CASE. AND IT CAN HELP THE THE DEFENSE WAY TO PROVE THAT SOMEONE IS INNOCENT OF THE CHARGES AGAINST THEM. ONE OF THE CURRENT PROBLEMS A. B. C.'S AB SIXTEEN HUNDRED SIX TO FIX IS THAT THE PROCESS FOR HEARING ON A PITCHES MOTION SIMPLY TAKES TOO LONG. IT HAS AN EXCESSIVELY LONG NOTICE REQUIREMENT OF SIXTEEN COURT DAYS. THIS DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE WITH WHEN NEARLY ALL THE OTHER MOTIONS THAT WE FILING CRIMINAL COURT REQUIRES JUST TEN DAYS NOTICE. IF WE WERE REDUCE THIS PROCESS BY JUST SIX DAYS FROM SIXTEEN COURT DAYS OF NO. TO TEN COURT DAYS OF NOTICE WE WOULD PROVIDE MORE MISDEMEANOR DEFENDANTS WITH ACCESS TO IMPORTANT DISCOVERY WITHOUT FORCING THEM TO WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL. THE OPPOSITION ARGUES THAT SHORTENING THIS NURSES NOTICE REQUIREMENT FROM SIXTEEN DAYS TO TEN DAYS WOULD MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO WRITE ANY WRITTEN OBJECTIONS IN OPPOSITION AND MAKE A DILIGENT SEARCH FOR RECORDS. WHICH THEY SAY WOULD MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO PREPARE MEANINGFUL OPPOSITIONS TO PURCHASE MOTIONS. BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE MOST CITY ATTORNEY'S JUST BROADLY OBJECT AND SIMPLY ARGUE THAT THE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS MOTIONS NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S ACTUAL MERIT TO THE MOTION. ALSO CITY ATTORNEYS DO NOT ACTUALLY SEARCH THROUGH ANY THE RECORDS AT ALL THEIR JOB IS TO PROVIDE ALL THE POLICE OFFICERS RECORDS TO THE COURT. THEN THE COURT IS THE ONE THAT REVIEWS THESE POLICE RECORDS SORTS OUT WHAT INFORMATION IF ANY SHOULD THEN BE TURNED OVER TO THE DEFENSE. THIS CHANGE IN THE NOTICE REQUIREMENT FROM SIXTEEN CORE DAYS TO TEN COURT DATES WILL RESULT IN MORE EQUITY MORE TRANSPARENCY IN MORE FAIRNESS WITHIN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. ESPECIALLY TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CHARGED WITH MISDEMEANORS AND WHO ARE IN CUSTODY AWAITING THEIR TRIALS. AFTER ALL WHEN PEOPLE HAVE MORE MEANINGFUL AND MORE TIMELY ACCESS TO PROPER TOOLS AT THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ALREADY HAS IN PLACE. THEN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WILL WORK BETTER FOR EVERYONE. I REMAIN AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY OF YOUR QUESTIONS AND I URGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON A. B. SIXTEEN HUNDRED THANK YOU. YOU MAY PROCEED GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS KATHLEEN GUNARATNE I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE ACLU OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE I WORK ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUES. BEFORE THAT I WAS A PUBLIC DEFENDER IN ALAMEDA COUNTY FOR MORE -- MORE THAN A DECADE WHEN I ARGUED MANY PITCHES MOTIONS. UNDER EXISTING LAW PEOPLE CHARGED WITH A CRIME ARE DENIED CRITIC CRITICAL INFORMATION ABOUT A PATTERN OF LAW ENFORCEMENT MISCONDUCT IN MANY KINDS OF CASES WHERE A SUPERVISOR SIGNED OFF ON A FALSE REPORT. WHERE SUPERVISOR INSTRUCTED HIS SUBORDINATE TO FILE A FALSE REPORT HELPED IN DRAFTING A FALSE REPORT? OR PARTICIPATED IN COVERING UP THE MISCONDUCT. FOR EXAMPLE I ONCE REPRESENTED A CLIENT CHARGED WITH RESISTING ARREST AND BATTERY ON A POLICE OFFICER. OUR INVESTIGATION CONCLUDES STRONGLY SUGGESTED THAT WHAT HAPPENED WAS HE HAD LED THE POLICE ON A FOOT CHASE THEY HAD BADLY BEATEN HIM UP. AND THAT THE CHARGES WERE AN ATTEMPT TO COVER UP FOR THE BEATING. THE REST WAS MADE -- AND ON ON SCENE BUT THE SUPERVISOR WAS NOT ON SCENE DURING THE ARREST. IN OUR INVESTIGATION IT APPEARED THAT THE R. ARRESTING OFFICER WHO MADE THE ARREST HAD TALKED TO HIS SUPERVISOR ABOUT WHAT TO WRITE IN THE POLICE REPORT THERE WERE SEVERAL DRAFTS OF THE POLICE REPORT THAT WE WHAT WE SAW. AND WE ACTUALLY EVEN RECEIVED A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT AUTHORED BY THE ARRESTING OFFICER WITH SUSPICIOUS NEW DETAILS THAT WERE CONTRADICTED BY GRAINY BODY CAMERA FOOTAGE. I SUSPECTED THAT THE SUPERVISING OFFICER HAD TOLD HIS SUBORDINATE TO SAY UNTRUE THINGS IN THE REPORT TO MAKE SURE THE CASE. STOOD UP IN COURT. UNDER EXISTING LAW I WAS POWERLESS HOWEVER TO GET PERSONNEL RECORDS FROM THE SUPERVISOR. THIS IS BECAUSE THE SUPERVISOR WAS NOT PRESENT DURING THE ARREST AND HAD NO DIRECT CONTACT WITH MY CLIENT. AB SIXTEEN HUNDRED MAKES A MODEST CHANGE TO THE EVIDENCE CODE THAT FIXES THIS PROBLEM THIS BILL WILL NOW ALLOW PEOPLE CHARGED WITH A CRIME TO OBTAIN CRITICAL PRIOR MISCONDUCT INFORMATION FROM DIRECT SUPERVISORS. WHEN IT'S RELEVANT TO THE DEFENSE? THERE HAVE BEEN MANY REPORTS OF A STRONG CODE OF SILENCE THAT EXISTS AMONG SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. AB SIXTEEN HUNDRED AS NECESSARY TO COMBAT THAT AND TO ENSURE THAT EVERY PERSON CHARGED WITH A CRIME GETS A FAIR TRIAL. AND THAT SUPERVISORS TO SIGN OFF ON OTHERS OFFICERS FALSE REPORTS. ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM HAVING THEIR MISCONDUCT DISCLOSED. I REMAIN AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND I WOULD ALSO URGE YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU LET'S SEE IF THERE'S OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SKINNER KARA -- JEFF TORTILLA. VARIOUS COALITIONS BUT STRONGLY IN SUPPORT HAVING SEEN THIS OCCUR MYSELF.

ALRIGHT LET'S HAVE THE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION AND WE'LL NEEDS A ROOM AT THE TABLE. I'M ASSUMING WE HAVE TO YES. WELCOME YOU CAN BEGIN. MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHARLES HARVEY ON BEHALF OF THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES AND WE ARE IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL. SIXTEEN HUNDRED A WE'VE BEEN IN TALKS WITH THE AUTHOR STAFF AND WE APPRECIATE THE WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN ONGOING DISCUSSIONS ON THIS BILL. I WITH REGARD TO THE PROPOSED EXPEDITED TIME FRAME IT IS ALREADY DIFFICULT FOR CITIES TO SUFFICIENTLY PREPARE FOR PITCHES MOTIONS WITHIN THE CURRENT SIXTEEN DAY TIME FRAME. UP WHAT THE CITY RECEIVED DEFENDANTS PITCHES MOTION SEPT SEVERAL PROCEDURAL STEPS ARE TAKEN. OF THE OFFICER TO NOTIFY THE CUSTODIAN AS TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS TO BE PRESENT AND A DILIGENT SEARCH FOR RECORDS HAS TO OCCUR -- IMPORTANTLY A CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE MUST ALSO PREPARE ANY WRITTEN OBJECTIONS AND OPPOSITIONS WITHIN THE PRESCRIBED TIME FRAME. THIS REQUIRES THE ATTORNEY TO REVIEW THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES IN EACH CASE TO FILL THEIR RECORD ETHICAL DUTY ZEALOUSLY REPRESENT THEIR CLIENT AND THEY HAVE TO DO THIS WHILE BOUNCING ALL THE OTHER DEMANDS ON THEIR WORKLOAD. THIS IS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT FOR SOLO IN HOUSE ATTORNEYS WHO ARE THE ONLY ONES AVAILABLE TO ASSIST THEIR CITY. WITH THE MANY LEGAL MATTERS THAT INEVITABLY ARISE. NOW CONSEQUENTLY SHORTENING THIS NOTICE REQUIREMENT -- FROM TEN DAYS TO FIVE COURT DAYS I WOULD CONSTRAIN ALREADY TIGHT RESPONSE WENDELL. THEREBY REDUCING CITIES OPPORTUNITY TO PREPARE A MEANINGFUL INAPPROPRIATE OPPOSITION TO A PITCHES MOTION. OF THE AUTHOR PROPONENTS ARGUE THAT -- AS AN EXAMPLE -- MISDEMEANOR DEFENDANTS IN CUSTODY -- WITH THE RIGHT TO A THIRTY DAY SPEEDY TRIAL CANNOT ACCESS MISCONDUCT RECORDS IN TIME TO BE ABLE TO USE THOSE UNDER THE CURRENT NOTICE REQUIREMENTS -- HOWEVER SECTIONS TEN FORTY THREE OF THE EVIDENCE CODE ALREADY INCLUDES A PROCESS FOR THE DEFENSE TO SHORTEN THE TIME FRAME FOR PROVIDING THE NOTICE GIVING THE COURT THE AUTHORITY TO ACCOMMODATE THE WISHES OF THE DEFENSE. NOW IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING FROM SPEAKING WITH CITY ATTORNEY'S THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT THESE REQUESTS TO SHORTEN TIME ARE NEARLY ALWAYS GRANTED. THIS BILL WOULD ESSENTIALLY REMOVE A JUDGE'S DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THESE ISSUES ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS. AND WOULD INSTEAD ALLOW DEFENSE ATTORNEY TO MERELY FILE A MOTION IN ALL CASES REGARDLESS OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND CITY HEARING JUST TEN COURT DAYS AHEAD OF TIME. LEADING CITIES AGAIN WOULD JUST FIVE COURT DAYS TO RESPOND. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT WHILE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS NO ONE CAN PLAN WHEN THEY WILL FILE AND TEND TO A PITCHES MOTION. IS CITY ATTORNEY HAS NO IDEA WHEN THE WHEN THEY WILL BE GIVEN SUCH A MOTION THAT HE OR SHE IS OBLIGATED TO RESPOND. TO AGAIN RECONCILING THIS UNFORESEEN TASK WITH OTHER WORK OR COMMITMENTS THAT MAY BE THEM INCLUDE COMPETING COURT OBLIGATIONS COUNCIL MEETING RESPONSIBILITIES OR DAYS OUT OF THE OFFICE. SCHEDULE VACATIONS ARE DUE TO TEMPORARY ILLNESS -- OR ANY OTHER CONFLICT REALLY -- THAT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR ANY WORKING PROFESSIONAL. IRONICALLY OUR WITNESS WHO WAS SUPPOSED TO BE HERE TODAY WHO SERVES AS A SOLO IN HOUSE CITY ATTORNEY FOR THE CITY OF SAN RAMON WAS UNABLE TO BE HERE BECAUSE IN PART SHE WAS THIRTY PITCHES MOTION THAT SHE HAS TO RESPOND. TO UNDER THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT PRECEDENT. THE DEFENDANT NEEDS TO SHOW WITH SPECIFIC FACTUAL SCENARIO OF POLICE OFFICER MISCONDUCT TO THE CHARGES THAT THE DEFENDANT IS FACING IN ORDER TO PREVAIL IN A PITCHES MOTION. MAKE THAT LEGAL STANDARD MORE CONCRETE CITY ATTORNEYS HAVE SHARED WITH US ANECDOTES THAT DEFENDANTS HAVE ARGUED THAT THEY SHOULD LOOK AT AN OFFICER'S PERSONNEL FILES -- FOR SAYS THE FORCE COMPLAINTS WHEN THEY ADMIT THAT THERE WAS NO FORCE USED IN THEIR REST OR WHERE DEFENDANTS DON'T DENY THAT THEY COMMITTED BATTERY. BUT STILL WANT TO LOOK AT AN OFFICER'S PERSONNEL FILE FALSE REPORTS OR WE'RE DEFENSE ATTORNEY HERSELF ADMITTED SHE HADN'T EVEN SPOKEN WITH THE DEFENDANT BUT WAS SURE THAT THE OFFICERS LIED ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED SO SHE FILED A PITCHES MOTION. NOW ACCORDING TO SOME OF OUR CITY ATTORNEYS TO HEAR SOME DEFENSE COUNSEL'S THEY WOULD SUGGEST THAT POLICE MISCONDUCT IS ALWAYS AT PLAY. AND BUT FOR TIME CONSIDERATIONS THESE DEFENSE ATTORNEYS WOULD FILE MORE PITCHESMOTIONS WHILE THE LEAGUE IS BY NO MEANS SUGGESTING THAT POLICE MCCARTY MISCONDUCT DOES NOT TAKE PLACE. THEY CANNOT BE PRESUME THAT SUCH MISCONDUCT OCCURS WITH EVERY ARREST WHICH IS EXACTLY WHY THE PITCHES PROCESS WITH ESTABLISHED IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IS NOTED THAT THE PICTURES PROCESS APPROPRIATELY BALANCES THE CONSTITUTIONAL DUE PROCESS OF CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS. ALONG WITH ANOTHER ONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT OF PRIVACY IN PERSONAL FILES. THIS IS WHY THE COURT REQUIRE SOME SHOWING BY THE DEFENSE AND ANY WEIGHING OF THESE INTERESTS. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF WE HAD MORE INSIGHT ON THE FREQUENCY. IN WHICH A DEFENDANT DOES NOT WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL BELIEVES THAT POLICE MISCONDUCT WOULD BE A REASON FOR HIS OR HER CONVICTION. THAT SAID AB SIXTEEN HUNDRED CAST A WIDE NET IN THAT THE SHORT NOTICE TIME FRAME WOULD APPLY TO CRIMINAL ACTIONS -- IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER A DEFENDANT WAIVES HIS OR HER RIGHT TO A SPEEDY TRIAL. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS WITH BOTH THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS HOPEFULLY TOWARD A MORE WORKABLE SOLUTION BUT AT THIS POINT WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE. I HAVE WITH ME MY COLLEAGUE COREY MANNING ASSISTANT GENERAL COUNSEL AT THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES IN THE EVENT THAT THERE ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. HIGHLIGHTS IF THERE'S ANOTHER WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR DEAR LUCIEN ON BEHALF OF THE LA POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE. WE WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR -- FOR MANY MANY MEETINGS IN NEGOTIATIONS TO TRY AND FIND A RESOLUTION. ULTIMATELY I THINK OUR PRIMARY CONCERN DEALS WITH SECTION FOUR OF THE BILL WHICH AUTHORIZES. OF SUPERVISORS PERSONNEL RECORDS TO BE ACCESSED WE WERE LOOKING. FOR SOME LANGUAGE THAT -- AT ONE POINT TIME WAS OFFERED. TO ENSURE THAT -- JUDGES WOULD NOT OVERREACH. ALLOWING DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN RECORDS. ARE TOURNEY'S AT THE LEGAL -- AT THE LA POLICE PROTECTIVE LEAGUE HAVE YOU KNOW BEEN IN SCENARIOS WHERE THEY CAN TELL YOU. ON THE LA COUNTY BENCH WHICH JUDGES ARE MORE LIKELY. TO LEAD A PARTICULAR TYPE OF PERSONNEL FILE OR RECORD BE ACCESSED -- AND WHICH ONES ARE LESS LIKELY SO WE WERE LOOKING FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE CERTAINTY. WITH THE LANGUAGE AGAIN NOT INTERESTED IN COVERING OF ANY TYPE OF MISCONDUCT -- WE WE BELIEVE THAT SOME GOOD LANGUAGE WAS OFFERED BUT ULTIMATELY THE AUTHOR DECIDED THAT -- THERE THAT LINK WHICH WAS NOT -- SOMETHING THAT THEY WERE INTERESTED IN AND SO -- WE'RE WE'RE HOPEFUL TO CONTINUE TALKING ON THIS TO FIND SOME RESOLUTION. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. FAITH BORDERS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES AND OUR COLLEAGUES AT SEA SAKE I A WITH A LIGHTER COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF THE LEAK RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- RAINY PERIOD BEHALF PORAC WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND OUR SPONSORS. AND BASED ON RECENT AMENDMENTS WERE REMOVED OUR OPPOSITION. ALRIGHT ANY OTHER WINNERS OR POSED. OKAY. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE -- COMMENTS QUESTIONS MOTION. GO AHEAD SENATOR MORE LOCK. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I I HAPPEN TO HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF MEETING SURE OF PITCHES. IT JUST SAYS SO IT'S KIND OF INTERESTING TO SEE THIS IN THE MATERIAL BUT HIS SONS ARE FRIENDS OF MINE. A JOHN AND ANDY -- BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS. WHAT'S THE PENALTY IF YOU MISS THE THE DATE IN SIXTEEN DAYS WHAT. WHAT ARE THE RAMIFICATIONS IF YOU DON'T MEET THE DEADLINE? WHAT I? LIKE ANY OTHER ANY OTHER VIOLATIONS OF TIMELINES OF THE COURT. A YOU COULD BUILD CONTENT THERE COULD BE OTHER PENALTIES. OTHER COULD BE ABOUT A OF A OF A COURT CAN HOLD THAT ARGUES THAT IS PART OF THEIR ADVENTURE PROCESS TO WHETHER THE EVIDENCE SHOULD BE ADMITTED OR NOT -- SO IT'S JUST LIKE BY THAT ANY OTHER COURT RULE I THINK THAT AS A AS A LAWYER -- I THINK THAT WE TAKE THOSE RULES IN TIME AS VERY SERIOUSLY BECAUSE YOU YOU CERTAINLY CAN BE PENALIZED EVEN DISBARRED IF YOU CHAU EXCESSIVE -- PATTERNS OF VIOLATING COURT RULES AND REGULATIONS AND ORDERS. SO SO MANY. COLOR WHITE WHY WOULD EVEN TAKE SIXTEEN DAYS I MEAN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SEEMS TO ME YOU COULD DO IT LESS THAN. THREE THAT'S WHY OF THOSE EVER SUGGESTING -- TEN SO THAT THERE CAN BE NO ARGUMENT THAT ARE ISN'T ENOUGH TIME SIXTEEN DAYS IS EXCESSIVE ESPECIALLY IF YOU CONSIDER THE THIRTY DAY TIME NOT WAYNE JURY TRIAL KEEPING IN MIND IT'S NOT LIKE DAY. ONE DAY ONE IS DAVE ARRAIGNMENT THAT SOMEONE OF PITCHES THE P. VALUES YOU HAVE TO BE ASSIGNED TO AN ATTORNEY. AND THAT AT SOME POINT SUBSTANTIVE THAT THE TWENTY LOOK AT THE CASE AND DETERMINE WHETHER IT BE JUST APPROPRIATE YOU ALREADY. AS MUCH AS A COUPLE WEEKS INTO THAT THIRTY DAYS BEFORE YOU EVEN GET AROUND TO MAKING A REQUEST FOR A PITCHES MOTION REVILING PUSHES MOTION. THAT'S WHEN IT STARTS THAT. SO I'M I'M CURIOUS WHAT HAPPENS IF THE FILE HAS BEEN PURGED. ALL THAT A EVERY LOOK THE IF IF THERE ARE FILES THAT HAVE BEEN REMOVED -- PURGE. HILL AND THERE'S ALL ACCESS TO ALLOW ACCESS TO THEM THIS IS REALLY AN EFFORT. TO UNDER THE BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES WERE FILES ARE AVAILABLE BUT THEY'RE MADE AVAILABLE. YOU CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR PAST BAD BEHAVIOR BUT THERE'S BY DEPARTMENT IN OFFICER ATTORNEY. YOU KNOW YOU YOU CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR THAT -- BUT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE WHAT RECORDS DO EXIST ARE REVEALED APPROPRIATELY WITH BUT THE JUDGES UNDER THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION THE JUDGE STILL OFTEN SHERMAN THAT'S RELEVANT. AND SO THE SUGGESTION THAT SOMEHOW DEFENSE ATTORNEY. SO THE YOU KNOW. THE THAT -- INTERESTED THAT WANTS TO BE RESPECTED BY THE COURT IS GONNA FILE MOTIONS ON A BROAD SWATH ON A WIDE. FISHING EXPEDITION EVERY TIME AND KEEP IN MIND OF A MOSTLY IS MOTIONS ABOUT A PUBLIC DEFENDERS ARE PART OF THE SAME JUDGES. DAY IN DAY OUT FOR MANY MANY YEARS. AND SO -- AND FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. YOU WANT TO BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT ABOUT HOW AGGRESSIVE YOU ARE WITH THESE TYPES OF MOTIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR AND HOW BOUT OF AND THAT. THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY PUT OUT THERE BECAUSE IF YOU COULD BECOME KNOWN AS SOMEONE THAT'S IS SEEKING FISHING EXPEDITIONS ON EVERY SINGLE MOTION YOUR LAST LESS LIKELY TO GET ANY. EVIDENCE REDUCE YOUR TO HAVE ANY OF THESE MOTIONS GRANTED REGARDLESS WITH PURCHASE OR OTHERWISE. THANK YOU THINK I AM NOT A LAWYER SO I THOUGHT I'D BURKE. BURKE FORGET PRESENTS A VERY LARGE ISSUE THE QUESTIONS BUT I'M HAPPY TO MEET TO MOVE THE BILL. SO WE HAVE A MOTION -- WITHOUT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS I WANT TO ASK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUST MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE THE SUN MORE LIKE FOR THE MOTION AND REALLY APPRECIATE PORAC AS WELL AS WITH SOME OF THOSE A SPOKEN OPPOSITION THAT REALLY DIDN'T WORKING WITH US TO TRY TO WORK ON LANGUAGE AND CONCERNS -- THIS BILL DOES NOTHING TO ALTER THE STANDARD BY WHICH I JUDGE USUALLY USES AND DETERMINING WHAT THE RECORDS ARE RELEVANT NOTS THE PROTECTION OF THE OFFICERS RECORDS IS NOT ALTERED IN THAT REGARD WHATSOEVER AND SO WITH THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BOOK. THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO THE FLOOR LET'S DO ROLL CALL SKINNER FIVE SKINNER AYE MOORLACH. WELL LIKE I BRADFORD JACKSON MITCHELL MORALE. WIENER RIGHT WIENER AYE.

HER EIGHT WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CHRISTY BHAMA ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS LET THAT BEA LESSON TO ME WE ARE VERY STRONG SUPPORTERS MEASURE AS WE HAVE PREVIOUS MEASURES. OF DRIVER. FOR LET'S SEE IF THERE'S OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WHERE ANY OTHER IN SUPPORT OKAY OPPOSITION. AND PLEASE YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME TO THE TABLE. YOU CAN GET RIGHT THERE -- CAM IS ABOUT ME YOU DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE BUT SO IF YOU [inaudible] GO AHEAD. MADAM CHAIR AT COMMITTEE -- TRENT LAYING OUT PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA CLEAN MONEY CAMPAIGN -- BUT WE VERY MUCH OF A SHARE OF THE GOALS OF THE LIMITING -- CURBING ABUSES OF THE INITIAL PROCESS BY SPECIAL INTERESTS THAT'S WHY WE WORKED ON THE CALIFORNIA'S GOES ACT FOR FOR SO LONG AND AND AND MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN THAT SO THAT THAT PEOPLE KNOW WHO IS PAYING FOR BALLOT MEASURE ADS. ON THAT'S WHY WE ARE WORKING. ON AND AND MY MOST MEMBERS HERE. ABOUT IN SUPPORT OF SB FORTY SEVEN THE PETITION DISCLOSE ACTS SO THAT WHEN INITIATIVE SIGNATURE GATHERERS -- APPROACH YOU DO KNOW WHO IS PAYING FOR THEM THEY HAVE TO BE TRUTHFUL IN THAT REGARD -- HE THE THE ITEMS IN THE BILL WERE NOT NECESSARILY OPPOSED TO IN CONCEPT THE PROBLEM IS. THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WHICH IS WHY THE WE YOU WHEN VOTERS AND A NUMBER OF OTHER GROUPS SHARE OUR ARE CONCERNED. THE THE PROBLEM IS THE TWO FOLD THERE'S THE THE 10% THRESHOLD REQUIRED FOR VOLUNTEERS AND ESSENTIALLY NONPROFIT STAFF TO QUALIFY FOR TRUE GRASSROOTS -- ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE REALLY USING. VOLUNTEERS THAT WILL BE VERY CHALLENGING THRESHOLD IN THE SIX MONTH PERIOD THAT YOU HAVE FOR THE NATIONAL PROCESS. ESPECIALLY. IF IT HAPPENS TO BE RAINY SEASON DURING THOSE SIX MONTHS FOR REAL VOLUNTEERS TO GET THAT MANY SIGNATURES -- AND THEN SECONDLY POSSIBLY EVEN MORE CONCERNING IS THE BAN ON PAYMENTS FOR SIGNATURE WHEN IT COMES TO THE ABILITY OF GRASSROOTS INITIATIVES REAL INITIATIVES. THAT ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY BILLION ERRORS OR OR SUPER -- WEALTHY CORPORATIONS -- IT WILL INCREASE THE COST A IN IN SUCH A WAY THAT THAT. ONE EXAMPLE IT WAS A KEY PART OF A FLORIDA BILL THAT WAS JUST PASSED AND SIGNED INTO LAW IN FLORIDA WHO HAD THE VERY TRANSPARENT PURPOSE. OF WARNING THE CITIZENS INITIAL PROCESS IN FLORIDA. AND I'LL JUST QUOTE FROM A COUPLE OF FLORIDA NEWSPAPER AS THEIR THE SARASOTA HERALD TRIBUNE DESCRIBED THE BILL THEY PASS WOULD MAKE IT A CRIME. TO PAY PETITION GATHERERS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF SIGNATURES THEY COLLECT. THAT CHANGE THAT EXPERTS SAY WILL LIKELY DOUBLE THE COST OF GETTING PROPOSALS ON THE BALLOT. AND THAT IS PRECISELY WHY THE FLORIDA LEGISLATURE INCLUDED THAT AS A KEY PROVISION OF THEIR BILL THAT OTHER HEADLINES IMPORTED SAID FLORIDA LAWMAKERS PLACE BARRIERS TO BALLOT INITIATIVES IT WAS THE THIRD SOARED HIGH HERALD TRIBUNE. DORLAND A WEEKLY FLORIDA LAWMAKERS WANT TO MAKE IT HARDER FOR SEARCHES OF THE MISSION IS TO GET ON THE BALLOT. IT GOES ON AND ON SOME OF MORE MUCH MORE DESCRIPTIVE NEGATIVE IN TERMS OF THEIR GOALS TO THWART THE CITIZENS INITIATIVE PROCESS WE KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT THE AUTHORS CALL. WE ABSOLUTELY I APPRECIATE THAT -- AND WE'VE BEEN HAPPY TO BE TALKING WITH HIM ABOUT POSSIBLE. SOLUTIONS TO THE PROBLEM ONE WOULD BE TO TO TO JUST LOWER THE THRESHOLD AND AND NOT HAVE THE BAN ON PAYMENTS PER SIGNATURE SO YOU DON'T HAVE THAT INCREASE IN COSTS. ANOTHER OPTION THAT WE'VE TALKED WITH HIM. THE OTHER EIGHT STATES THAT BAND PAYMENTS PER SIGNATURE ALL HAVE A MINIMUM OF ONE YEAR FOR SIGNATURES TO BE GATHERED ONE YEAR IN MANY CASES TWO YEARS ARIZONA OREGON FLORIDA ALL HAVE TWO YEAR PERIODS ACTUALLY PERSISTENCE TO QUALIFY. IF YOU HAD THAT THEN -- THAT AMOUNT OF TIME TO THAT WOULD MAKE UP FOR THE ADDED COSTS OF BANNING PAYMENTS. UPPER SIGNATURE AND ALLOW TRUE VOLUNTEER BECAUSE TRUE VOLUNTEER CAMPAIGNS WOULD HAVE MORE TIME. TO GET SIGNATURES UNPAID WHICH IS I THINK WHAT WE WOULD ALL WANT AND WHICH IS THE PURPOSE OF THE SIGNATURE GATHERING OUT PROCESS SO WITH THAT WE RICK RESPECTFULLY WE'RE HAPY TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR BUT BUT WE SUPPOSE STRONGLY OPPOSE. UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. OUR NEXT WITNESS IN OPPOSITION YES MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SAID DAVID WOLF BARRETT JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO A. B. FOURTEEN FIFTY ONE AS WE WERE AT MISTER LOW'S BILL -- LAST YEAR WHICH DID BASICALLY THE SAME THANKS -- MADAM CHAIR LET ME BE VERY CLEAR. THERE IS TOO MUCH MONEY IN POLITICS. WE ALL WE ALL AGREE. RIGHT. WE ALL AGREE THAT WE WANT TO SEE REDUCTIONS IN THE COST TO QUALIFY A ALLOT MEASURE FOR THE BALLOT. IT'S ABSURD THAT IT TAKES THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO QUALIFY A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT FOR THE BALLOT. WE WANT TO SEE DECREASES IN THAT WE AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR I AGREE WITH MISTER LANG. REPEAT SIX THAT WE ALL. THAT WE ALL WANT TO SEE THIS. THERE'S A FIRST TIME FOR EVERYTHING MEMBERS -- WE ALL WANT TO SEE THIS. OKAY. A BUT DOES THIS BILL REALLY STRIKE AT THE SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM BANNING PAID SIGNATURES AND MOVING TO AN HOURLY RATE. YOU MAY HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THERE ARE ACTUALLY INCREASING MONEY IN POLITICS NOT DECREASING IT SO WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WE'RE NOT SURE IF THIS ABSOLUTELY FIXES THE PROBLEM. AND WE AGREE WITH MR LYING AS WE SAID IN OUR OPPOSITION LETTER THAT INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF TIME TO GATHER SIGNATURES FROM SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR WILL ABSOLUTELY FUNDAMENTALLY DECREASE MONEY IN POLITICS. LISTEN WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS IN OUR ASSOCIATION -- WE CAN GO OUT AND YOU KNOW USE VOLUNTEERS GET SIGNATURES FROM THAT. BUT WE NEED MORE TIME TO DO IT IT'S VERY HARD TO MOBILIZE ALL THAT IN SIX MONTHS YOU GIVE US A YEAR. IT MAKES IT FAR MORE LIKELY WE WOULD BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS SO WE WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR JUST AS WE SAID WE WOULD LAST YEAR. ON THIS ISSUE AND HOPE WE CAN GET TO A PLACE FROM MAYBE WE CAN COME OFF THIS BILL BUT IN THE MEANTIME ASK FOR NOVA. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YEP THAT -- THIS TIME I REPRESENTING KARA. ALL IN A BUNCH OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IN TELLING YOU THE UNINTENTIONAL CONSEQUENCES LEGISLATURE'S WERE STRONGLY IN OPPOSITION OF THIS THING WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU. THANK YOU. WITH A ONE MINUTE OUT OF BREATH PRESENTATION RUNNING UP FROM JUDICIARY NO I'VE HEARD FROM TWO IF YOU DON'T MIND JUST OF THIS YEAR. THIRTY SECONDS SURE TO BE A SUMMER THERE WITH CAL CHAMBER IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THANK YOU FOR INTELLIGENCE. WE DID ONE ADDRESS THAT WHILE THE FINDINGS DO AND TO SUGGEST THIS BILL IS TO JUST THE PERCEPTION OF SIGNATURE GATHERING ISSUES AND FRAUD. PERCEPTION IS NOT SUPPORTED BY DATA AND I DO WONDER AND POINT OUT THAT THE COMMITTEE DID CORRECTLY -- POINT OUT THAT THE MISREPRESENTATION OR FRAUD IS ALREADY A MISDEMEANOR UNDER THE LAW AND WE DO NOT THINK THAT THIS BILL IS NECESSARY TO AFFECT THE PURPOSES THEY WERE PUT UP BY THE BILL SO WE REMAIN IN OPPOSITION.

APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE MITCH SNIDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL -- WE JUST WANT TO MENTION THA WERE WORKING WITH SOME OF OUR AFFILIATES TO DEAL WITH ONE OUTSTANDING REMAINING CONCERN HAVING TO DO WITH THE DIFFERENTLY COLORED PETITIONS -- HOPEFULLY THAT GET TAKEN CARE OF AND WE COME BACK ON AND SUPPORT WE'VE SPONSORED SIMILAR LEGISLATION IN THE PAST DEALING WITH THE ACTIVISTS THRESHOLD. WE THINK IT'S FANTASTIC WAY TO HELP RETURN THE INITIATIVE PROCESS BACK TO THE WAY THAT WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING BACK IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MY NAME IS EVE CERTAIN AND MANY OF THE PEOPLE ON THE COMMITTEE ALREADY GET EMAIL FROM ME THAT STARTS WITH NEW LAWS IN THE SUBJECT LINE -- THAT'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA WHOARE FIGHTING ILLEGAL FORECLOSURES AND ILLEGAL EVICTIONS AFTER FORECLOSURES. IT'LL BE A MERE OPPOSE OR NOT YES SO PLEASE OPPOSE INVESTMENT BANKING [inaudible] RIGHT [inaudible] COMMITTEE MEMBERS [inaudible] CENTER WIENER. HERE ON OUR TO THE AUTUMN THIS IS -- IS A THORNY SUBJECT BECAUSE DE THE ABUSES. WHAT THE SIGNATURE GATHERING ARE IT'S JUST? YOU KNOW WHEN YOU COMBINE SOMEONE WAS LIKE -- FIFTEEN PETITIONS AND AN ARTIST. OFTEN DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SIGNING LIKE TO GO ON AND ON ABOUT. HELD BROKEN THE BALLOT MEASURE SYSTEM AS IS ALSO. DISTINCTION BETWEEN STATE AND LOCAL ART FOR AYE AYE. I THINK. IN TERMS OF WHEN THE LAST VOLUNTEER DRIVEN STATEWIDE MEASURE QUALIFIED HASN'T BEEN LIKE THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS THAT'S ESSENTIALLY ON FORCING IMPOSSIBLE -- INTO STATEWIDE BALLOT MEASURES SYSTEM. IN CALIFORNIA IS SUCH A TOXIC DISASTER AND THE VOTERS SEE IT WHEN. WE SEE WHAT MAKES ON THE BALLOT ALLIES LIKE WISE OR AN AMBULANCE. MEASURE ON THE BALLOT RIGHT IT SAYS BECAUSE CORPORATIONS COMPLETE WHATEVER THEY WANT ON THE BALLOT LOCALLY OF COURSE IT'S IT'S DIFFERENT. LOCAL BALLOT MEASURES WE STILL SEE VOLUNTEER DRIVEN SO IT'S A IT'S A MIXED. BAG SO I GUESS I'D TO THE AUTHOR IF YOU WOULD PROFS JUST RESPOND TO SOME OF THE SPECIFIC I GUESS THE TO SPECIFIC CRITICS. OF FROM THE OPPONENTS ABOUT 10% AND ABOUT THE ONE YEAR VERSUS SIX MONTHS. YES -- AS WE OF A SIMILE STATED IN PRESENTATION AND SENATE ELECTIONS COMMITTEE -- AND CONSISTENT WITH THE ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS COMMITTEE AS WELL WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE THE BEST THE TYPE OF PRODUCT THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US AS IN NOTED INCOME NOW SAYS THIS IS. BEEN A SUBJECT OF MANY ITERATIONS OF BEFORE AND INCLUDING FROM THE SENATOR AND PREVIOUSLY FROM CENTER NEWMAN. ABOUT WE LEAVE THAT THIS IS THE BEST A COMPROMISE APPROACHED HIM ENSURING THAT TYPE OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY -- AT THE HEART OF THIS WAS SUCH THAT -- AYE SIMILE WAS APPROACHED BY SOMEONE OUTSIDE A TRADER JOE'S AND THEY SAID I DO WANT TO STOP THE TYRANNY OF THE SACRAMENTO POLITICIANS AND I SAID EXCUSE ME PLEASE. INFORM ME ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING -- TO AND OF COURSE -- WHEN THEY START TALKING ABOUT TRANSPORTATION REVENUES GAS TAX THEY SAID THAT THIS SEGMENT OF POLITICIANS WE'RE GOING TO USE IT TO BALANCE THE BUDGET IN OTHER AREAS AND I SAID I THINK YOU'RE FACTUALLY INCORRECT? TO WHICH THAT PETITION TOGETHER IMMEDIATELY STOPPED AND WENT TO THE NEXT INDIVIDUAL TO TRY TO PERSUADE THEM TO ALSO SIGNED THAT PETITION IT'S CLEAR THAT WHEN INCENTIVIZE -- PAID BY SIGNATURE UP TIGHT UPWARDS OF TEN DOLLARS A SIGNATURE A THERE IS NO INCENTIVE TO TALK ABOUT THE INTEGRITY AND HAVE A ROBUST DIALOGUE CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. RATHER THAT OF THE HEART SIGNATURE AND I WITNESSED THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN SIMILARLY SO AGAIN THAT THIS IS NOT THIS DID THAT JUST HAPPEN OVERNIGHT AT THIS BEEN. MANY ITERATIONS OF THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION TO WHICH IS IN CAPS LATE BEFORE CJ AND BOUNCE THE PROVISION I THINK A WITH THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES HERE. ACCURATELY REFLECTS THAT OF COURSE WILL BE COMPETING MEASURES BUT AS YOU HEARD WE'VE BEEN I TRYING TO WORK AS MUCH IN GOOD FAITH AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO WITH THE INDIVIDUALS IN OPPOSITION -- SHOULD THIS TO MOVE FORWARD AND SPECIFIC IN TERMS OF THE SIX MONTHS VERSUS TWELVE MONTHS COULD JUST COMMENT ON THAT YES -- I BELIEVE THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME -- AT CHALLENGES WITH THE BE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES -- BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT TIME FRAME AT THIS POINT IS -- SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO SEE MOVE FORWARD AS THE BILL PRESENTED BUT OF COURSE WILL BE CONTINUALLY HAPPY TO TALK TO OPPOSITION SHOULD THIS MOVE. FOR CENTER WIENER DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTION SIR OKAY ANY OTHER FROM THE DÃ­AS -- I JUST WONDER EXPRESS I APPRECIATE. THE FOLKS. AND COMING TO THE HEARING AND TESTIFYING AND THE CONCERN THAT. THE BILL WOULD -- BASICALLY FAVOR MONEYED INTERESTS IN TERMS OF THE N. INITIATIVE GATHERING. PROCESS AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THESE FUNDAMENTAL WHERE IT'S KIND OF IT -- I CAN SEE I CAN APPRECIATE THAT PERSPECTIVE. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THAT OCCURS BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM VERY PROBABLE TO ME ONLY BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SUCH A HUGE STATE [inaudible] AND UNFORTUNATELY THE ENTIRE INITIATIVE PROCESS IS SKEWED TOWARDS MONEYED INTERESTS. AND HAVING. OF HAVING THE INDIVIDUAL PAID SIGNATURE [inaudible] IT'S AT IT ALLOWS FOR THOSE MONIED INTERESTS TO BE BE ABLE ALMOST UNLIMITED NUMBERS OF PEOPLE -- TO THEN COLLECT SIGNATURES AND THEY HAVE A GREAT INCENTIVE BECAUSE THEY ARE AT PAID PER SIGNATURE. MOST OF OUR GRASSROOTS EFFORTS PEOPLE ARE MOTIVATED OBVIOUSLY BY. MORE THAN MONEY IN TERMS OF THAT SIGNATURE GATHERING PROCESS IS STILL GOING TO BE DIFFICULT FOR GRASSROOTS EFFORTS -- TO GET THINGS ON A BALLOT IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE KNOW THAT WE'VE KNOWN THAT FOR A LONG TIME I DON'T KNOW. QUITE WHAT REFORMS WE'D HAVE TO DO TO DEAL WITH THAT GIVEN THAT WE ARE A STATE OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE -- BUT I AM WILLING TO HAVE THE BILL MOVE. AND I DO APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S SHOWING UP AND I DON'T MEAN TO INVALIDATE THEIR CONCERNS BUT I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE WHERE IT'S A. -- WHETHER WE FEEL THAT THE INDIVIDUAL PAYING PER INDIVIDUAL SIGNATURE OR MAKE IT LET MORE EXPENSIVE OR PAYING FROM BY OUR IN FACT AND I THINK THAT'S THE THAT'S THOSE ARE. THE LEGITIMATE DEBATABLE POINT ON ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FOR THE DIALOGUE AND JUST WANT TO REITERATE AND WE FROM THE POINT THAT INDIVIDUALS CAN STILL BE PAID BY STIPEND AND OUR HOURLY SO -- INDIVIDUAL STILL HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY BUT AGAIN JUST NOT TO BE INCENTIVIZE BY THAT SIGNATURES THAT WE CAN HAVE A ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT THE INTEGRITY. OF THE PROPOSITIONS OF POTENTIAL OPPOSITION THAT WE HOPE TO SEE ON THE BALLOT AND HOPE NOT TO SEE SO OF WITH RESPECT TO ASK THE PRIVATE. ALRIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION I BELIEVE NO YES NO OKAY IS THERE A MOTION. WE'LL GO. RIGHT SENATOR BRADFORD IS MOVED THE BILL -- LET'S DO A ROLL CALL. IT SAYS THE MOTION IS TO PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS THAT'S TO ROLL CALL SKINNER HI SKINNER AYE MORE LOCK. MORE LIKE NOW BRADFORD PARK BRADFORD AYE JACKSON. MITCHELL MORALE. ROSE SAID NO.
