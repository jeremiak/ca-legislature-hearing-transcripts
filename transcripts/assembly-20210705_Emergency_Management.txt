WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH SENATE BILL ONE ONLINE AND ITS UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS THE THIRTY MINUTES WILL KEEP BY STATE. TECHNOLOGIES LIKE THREE THIRTY ONE AERIAL CROP SURVEILLANCE AND PREDICTIVE POLICING SYSTEMS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO CAUSE HARM TO SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. AND THE DEPLOYMENT OF SUCH SYSTEMS THAT PROTECT AND DEMONSTRATIONS WOULD ONLY EXACERBATE THAT HARM. SB ONE ONLINE AUTHORIZES THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. TO FURTHER DEVELOP SURVEILLANCE AND POLICING TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD BE USED TO TARGET COMMUNITIES AS THEY DEMAND A MORE JACKSON. EQUITABLE FUTURE FOR CALIFORNIA. THIS IS PARTICULARLY. AND LYFT THE RAMP TO BE ABLE APPROACH. THAT WE WITNESSED NATIONWIDE LAST SUMMER DURING ONE OF THE LARGEST MOVEMENTS IN U. S. HISTORY. INCLUDING DOCUMENTED GOVERNMENT USES THAT AERIAL SURVEILLANCE AND SOCIAL MEDIA MONITORING. THIS MASSIVE EVENT UNDERMINES PEOPLE'S FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT INSTILLING FEAR RETRIBUTION FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. WELL WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS ADOPTED LAST WEEK WE ASKED THAT HE ACCEPTED ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS TO BE OFFERED TO THE DRAFT I REMAIN CNCERNED BY NARROWING THE DEFINITION OF EMERGENCY THREAT. TO ONLY NATURAL DISASTER AN ENVIRONMENTAL EMERGENCY RELATED EVENTS TO ENSURE THE SCOPE OF THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS LIMITED TO DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES ONLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF IMPROVING WILDFIRE AND OUR NATURAL DISASTER PREPARATION AND RESPONSE. THIS WOMAN SURE THE CALIFORNIANS ENGAGING IN PROTESTS IN OTHER POLITICAL SPEECH ARE NOT SUBJECTED TO INCREASE SURVEILLANCE THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITHOUT- IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM FOR OPPOSITION.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER GALLAGHER. MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FOR I THINK IT'S A- GREAT IDEA AND CERTAINLY I THINK THAT HAVING THIS- YOU KNOW THIS AGENCY AND BEING ABLE TO REALLY HONE IN N. NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN HELP US BE MORE PREPAREDOBVIOUSLY SOMETHING IS VERY COMMON TO BOTH OF US- HAVING- DISTRICTS GONE THROUGH WHAT THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH- BUT- I THINK. THERE'S SO MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE- SO MANY TECHNOLOGIES OUT THERE THAT CAN HELP US BE USED SO MUCH MORE RESPONSIVE SO I APPRECIATE THIS AND WILL BE SUPPORTED TODAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- THE OTHER QUESTION A QUESTION. NOT REALLY QUESTION JUST A COMMENT I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU HIS CENTER JOB FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD- YOU KNOW OF TO CURRENTLY A LOT OF COMMUNITIES. ATTEMPT TO DO THIS AND YOU SEE THE DISJOINTED EFFORT OUT THERE. AS SOME COMMUNITIES HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY AND SOME DON'T SOME DON'T EVEN HAVE THE ABILITY TO. IT TO FIND THE TECHNOLOGY THAT BEST SUITS OUR AREA I THINK SOMETHING LIKE THIS WILL HELP. AND ACCORDING TO THAT EFFORT AND- YOU KNOW I DON'T SEE IT AS MUCH OF A SURVEILLANCE ISSUE IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT- BECAUSE WE CLEARLY AREN'T REALLY GOOD AT IT YET- HOW TO MANAGE AND- AND- MAKE PLANS FOR. AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT- ISSUES- WE'VE BEEN PLANNING THESE THINGS FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS AND YET WE ARE STILL KIND OF BEHIND THE CURVE EVERY TIME WE HAVE A MAJOR INCIDENT. AND SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO USE CURRENT TECHNOLOGY FOR THAT ADVANTAGE AND BE ABLE. TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT BY ALL OF OUR CAN- AND IN A MORE. EFFORT SO THERE KIND DOING THIS THING AND WHAT BUYING ONE PROGRAM ONE V. ANOTHER PROGRAM FROM ANOTHER VENDOR AND GOING TO BE THEY FINE OUT THAT IT WORK. FOR THEIR CAN.

CINNAMON AGUIAR-CURRY I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR OUR PARTNERSHIP AND FIRES. TO GET RIGHT INTO IT AND I'LL KEEP IT SHORT MISTER CHAIR. HERE'S WHAT THREE FORTY ONE DIES NUMBER ONE IT PROVIDES THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION EXPLICIT AUTHORITY TO CREATE BACKUP POWER RULES FOR CELL TOWERS. LAND MINE OPERATIONS IN CABLE PHONE SYSTEMS. NUMBER TWO. IT DOES NOT TOUCH THE CURRENT. PC PROCEEDINGS ON BACK UP POWER. NOT ONE BIT. NUMBER THREE IT MANDATES THE STATE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES. TO SHARE INFORMATION THEY ALREADY RECEIVE FROM TELECOM COMPANIES. I NETWORK OUTAGES TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. I THE REASON THIS IS SO CRITICAL IS THAT THE C. P. C. AS YOU ALL KNOW. IS CHARGED WITH KEEPING THE NETWORKS UP AND RUNNING. AND MAKING THEM MORE RESILIENT BUT THEY CURRENTLY DON'T HAVE THE STATUTORY. ABILITY TO SEE THIS INFORMATION WHICH MEANS. THAT THEY CAN'T INSURE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE NETWORKS ACROSS THE GOLDEN STATE. AND WHY WE KNOW THIS IS IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE DURING TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IS PLANNED PARENTHOOD TO BUCKLE. AT ITS PEAK NEARLY TWO MILLION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. HAVE THEIR LAND LINE CELL PHONE AND CABLE SERVICE INTERRUPTED. SB THREE FORTY ONE IS A COMMON SENSE BILL TO MAKE SURE THE TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS IN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. ARE DOING WHAT THEY NEED TO IMPROVE THE STATE'S NINE ONE NETWORKS. AND TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS TO CRUCIAL INFORMATION. ABOUT OUTAGES ACROSS THE GOLDEN STATE AND IT'S ONE ALSO SAY THANK YOU. TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS THE INDUSTRY FOR THEIR SINCERE ENGAGEMENT. THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING HARD ON THIS BILL- AND TRYING TO GET A STRIKE A COMPROMISE ON ALL LEVELS.

WHAT DO WE LOOK AT THE CAMPFIRE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN UP IN PARADISE. OR OF THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NORTH BAY FIRESTORM. GETTING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SAFELY EVACUATED IN THE EARLY HOURS OF THE DISASTER IS LIFE OR DEATH. AND OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND OUR RESIDENTS NEED AND HAVE COME TO EXPECT OUR PHONES TO WORK WHEN DISASTER STRIKES. SB THREE FORTY ONE WILL IMPROVE OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS BY CREATING STRONGER OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS. AND THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. WHEN IT COMES THE TELECOMMUNICATION OUTAGES AND BACK UP POWER SYSTEMS. DURING THE POWER OUTAGES IN OCTOBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN NEARLY TWO MILLION NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE THEIR LAND LINE CELL PHONE AND CABLE SERVICE INTERRUPTED. BUT SMALLER OUTAGES OCCUR AND ARE REPORTED TO- YEAH. DEMONSTRATING WEAKNESS AND ARE MURKY COMMUNICATION SYSTEM. BUT THE CPUC HAS NO IDEA WHEN THEY'RE OCCURRING. SB THREE FORTY ONE FOUR REQUIRE ONLY HALF THE SHARE COMMUNITY ISOLATION OUTAGE INFORMATION WITH THE CPUC AND REQUIRES THE CPUC TO RECORD THE LEGISLATURE ON ACTION TAKEN USING COMMUNITY ISOLATION OUTAGE INFORMATION. THE CPUC REGULATES TELECOMMUNICATIONS WORKS FOR CHOIR REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE BACKUP POWER BUT TELCOS. REPORT OUTAGES TO THEIR NETWORKS TO THE- YEAH.

HE IS NOT RESPONDING SIR OKAY THAT'S FINE THANK YOU OPERATOR. I BELIEVE WE DO HAVE- SOMEONE IN OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM I BELIEVE WE HAVE BERNIE OROZCO FROM THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION. WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME FORWARD AND ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE SIR. YES THANK YOU HAVE A GERMAN RECENT MEMBERS BERNIE OROZCO CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION TO SB THREE FOR ONE. ARE YOU CLARIFY THAT WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE SEVENTY TWO HOURS OF BACKUP POWER AND FOR THE MAPPING OF OUTAGE INFORMATION TO CONSUMERS. THAT WAS ALREADY ADOPTED IN FEBRUARY EIGHTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS YEAR SO NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS BILL THAT IS HAPPENING- NEXT MONTH WE WILL BE SUBMITTING OUR- ACTION PLANS TO THE P. YOU SEE ON HOW WE PLAN ON DOING THAT. AND WE'RE WE HAVE SOME CHALLENGES AND THEN BY OCTOBER THIS YEAR WE WILL DEPLOY THE VERY FIRST BACKUP GENERATORS TO ALL CRITICAL CUSTOMERS. IN HIGH FIRE THREAT TO IN THREE AREAS AND SO TEN MONTHS AFTER THAT ALL CUSTOMERS IN HIGH FIRE THREAT TO IN THREE AREAS WILL HAVE BACKUP GENERATION. SO THIS IS SOMETHING IS ALREADY IN PLACE SO WHAT WE HAVE. BEFORE YOU TO TODAY IS HOW BEST DO WE GO ABOUT DOING THAT AND WE ARE WORKING WITH THE SENATOR WE WANT TO THANK HIM. FOR CONVENING THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES IN. TO KIND OF HELP US GET THOSE PERMITS GOING IN PLACE SO THAT'S FOR THAT SENATOR WE ARE VERY THANKFUL- WE WANT TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT. ON SOME OF THE OTER PROVISIONS WRITTEN INTO THE- THE DETAILS IS ALWAYS IN THE LANGUAGE AND WE LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT PORTION THAT PORTION OF IT. BUT AT THE MOMENT WE'RE STILL. POSE BUT THANKFUL FOR WORKING WITH THE CENTER. THANK YOU IS OUR- ELSE IN THE ROOM NO POSITION. SEEING NONE WILL MOVE ON TO THE PHONES OPERATORS ARE ANYONE ON THE LINE OPPOSITION. YES WE DO HAVE BLANK TWENTY SEVEN YOU MAY GO AHEAD. A GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS IS PAMELA SMITH ON BEHALF OF CONSOLIDATED COMMUNICATIONS. IN OPPOSITION. AND THERE'S NO OTHER LINE IN OPPOSITION YOU MAY CONTINUE OKAY THANK YOU SEEN THAT WILL BRING BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. BY STERN QUESTION YEAH GOING. SO ALL OF THIS HAS A COST TO IT. YOU KNOW WHAT THAT COST IS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PAST IS GONNA BE DEPLOYING THE BACKUP ENERGY- AND WE HAD A BILL LAST YEAR THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED SEVENTY TWO HOUR BACKUP POWER FOR JUST SOME SPECIFIC CELL SITES. THAT BILL DO NOT MAKE IT OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY FIGHT TO BE CANDID AT THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THEN TOOK UP THE ISSUE THAT THEY DID TWO DIFFERENT RULINGS THE FIRST RULING WAS ON- MOBILE. TELECOM WIRELESS IN THE SECOND WAS ON LAND LINE THAT WAS EARLIER THIS YEAR THIS BILL DOES NOT HAVE THOSE COSTS IN IT IS GOING TO BE A SIGNIFICANT COST FOR THE SEVENTY TWO HOUR. WHERE THEY THE GUTS OF THIS BILL WILL DO IS ALREADY REQUIRED. RIGHT NOW THE STATE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES ALREADY RECEIVES INFORMATION ON WHY THE OUTAGE HAPPENED. THAT'S WAS IN A PREVIOUS BILL THAT WE BROUGHT FORWARD THAT- THE ASSEMBLY ALSO SUPPORTER AND I'M VERY GRATEFULFOR. THAT REALLY THE GOT TO THIS BILL TAKES THE INFORMATION THE STATE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES ALREADY HAS. PROVIDED THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION RIGHT NOW THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION CANNOT GET ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION ABOUT WHY THERE WAS- AN OUTAGE AND I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR WITH THIS BILL ALSO DOES IS BROAD AND THEN MAPPING AS WELL AS EXPANDS THE- THAT THE INFORMATION COULD BE CAPTURED. SO BERNIE WAS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT IN WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR CABLE FOR THROUGH SINCERE ENGAGEMENT- BUT RIGHT NOW- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S A DISASTER DECLARATION AND MAPPING HAPPENS IF A TRUCK HITS A TELL- A PIECE OF FIBER AS IT DID TWO YEARS AGO GOING UP THE HUMBLE. AND IT TOOK OUT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CUSTOMERS THERE IS NO MAPPY IT TAKES IT IN FOR CONSISTENCY CUSTOMERS DON'T LOOK IF THERE'S A DISASTER OR FOR TRUNCATED THEY WANT TO KNOW WHY THEIR SERVICE ISN'T WORKING. AND SO IT BRINGS CONSISTENCY BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE COST IS BASED OFF OF THE PUBLIC UTILITIES ACTION BECAUSE THE BOOK OF THIS BILL IS SIMPLY SHARING INFORMATION TO THE PC WHO OVERSEES. TELECOM HERE IN THE STATE AND ENSURE THAT THE RESILIENCY IS GOING TO AFFECT SO THE POLICY QUESTION THAT I LOOK AT IS THERE IS A COST TO IT HOUSE I CAST COST BORN IS THAT COST BORNE BY RATEPAYERS. WHO ARE SPECIFIC TO WHATEVER COMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES THEY ARE OR ARE IS AT A COST THAT SHOULD BE BORNE BY FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE. A SHARED COSTS. BY AT LEAST A SHARED COST. BY THE- WHO HAVE PAID. THIRTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OF EXTRA TAX MONEY THIS YEAR. IS THIS IS I MEAN THIS IS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. FOR OUR PEOPLE'S SURVIVAL DURING ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE POWER OUTAGES AND THINGS LKE THAT AND- IF THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL COSTS TO IT IT WINDS UP BEING BORN ON. IT TURNS IT TURNS UP IN THE BILL'S ESPECIALLY IF THE PC IS INVOLVED SO THEY'LL APPROVE THOSE COST INCREASES AND THAT MEANS LESS PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO AFFORD THOSE SERVICES. SO YOU KNOW IT FOR ME IT'S AND IT'S- YOU KNOW I'M- I'M KIND OF CAUGHT HERE BECAUSE- I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THE EFFORT. I JUST WISH WE WOULD WORK ON THE POLICY OF SHOULD THE STATE. SHOULD WE BE USING AS THIS IS SHOULD BE A PRIORITY- OF FUNDING THAT WE HAVE ALREADY TO HELP OFFSET THOSE COSTS SO MORE PEOPLE CAN BE INVOLVED. IN IT SO THEY'RE NOT PRICED OUT OF HAVING THE SERVICES. BECAUSE THAT'S TO ME THAT'S THE DANGER IS THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE THAT WILL BE PRICED RIGHT OUT OF HAVING THESE SERVICES. BECAUSE IF THIS IS A HUGE COSTS BUT YOU SAY IT IS AND IT'S ALL PASSED THROUGH ON BILLS. YOU KNOW I I'VE WATCHED MY BILL GO FROM 220-022-0050 IN ABOUT ELEVEN MONTHS. AND THERE'S JUST DIRECT I HAVEN'T ADDED ANYTHING EFFECTIVE TAKEN STEP AWAY FROM IT. EVENTUALLY PEOPLE JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT I THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE HERE IN THE STATE. IS THAT WE ARE- ONE LARGE FIRE AWAY. ONE POWER SHUT OFF AWAY FROM LOSING- TELECOM FOR TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS HAVE THAT'S THE COST BUT WHEN YOU CAN ACCESS AT NINE ONE ONE. WHEN YOU DON'T GET EMERGENCY ALERTS BUT WHEN THAT TRUCK HIT THAT FIBER GOING UP THE HUMBLE YOU COULDN'T ACCESS ATM YOU COULD USE YOUR CREDIT CARD AT LOCAL GROCERY STORES THIS IS LITERALLY DAYS ON END WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE COST TO THE ECONOMY IS. WHEN THIS INFRASTRUCTURE GOES DOWN IT'S IN THE MILLIONS AND IT ALSO COSTS LIVES- WHAT I EAT IN THIS BILL- THIS DOESN'T TOUCH THE PROCEEDINGS REGARDING- SEVEN TO OUR POWER BACK UP THAT DECISION FOR TWO FOLDERS ALREADY BEEN MADE. SO MINIMAL COSTS IN THE REASON WHY IS A MINIMAL COST THE STATE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE TO GET THIS INFORMATION. A LITTLE EXTENDED OVER THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. RIGHT NOW THAT'S NOT HAPPENING BECAUSE STATE STATUTE DOESN'T ALLOW ME TO DO THAT SO IT'S A MINIMAL COST AND CANDIDLY IT WILL BE SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT BECAUSE OUR ENTIRE AT TELECOM- WIRELESS SYSTEM AS WELL AS CABLE SYSTEM WILL BENEFIT FROM THE RESILIENCY THAT THIS WILL CREATE RIGHT N. AGAIN THE POLICY QUESTION IS DO WE JUST PAY FOR THAT OR DO WE TRY TO PASS ALONG EVERYBODY IN THE BILLS MAKE THE BILL HIGHER. MORE PEOPLE DROP OFF SO ANYWAY THAT'S JUST THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS WITH THAT I REALLY DO THINK THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS IN HERE- BUT- I JUST WISH WE WOULD WORK OUT THE COSTS IN OUR PRIORITIES A LITTLE BIT MORE- TECH TO BE ABLE TO GET THESE THINGS DONE ON THE GROUND A LOT QUICKER THANK YOU KNOW THINKING AND NOTHING I SAY MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR FRESHERS THE ISSUE IS- IN THE ANALYSIS BY THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE- IT'S- MINOR. BUT OF DURABLE COST TO THE COMPANY PUBLIC TOES COMMISSION I THINK LAST. SUMMER AGUIAR-CURRY GOT A QUESTION. THEY CALL. ON THE PHONE OKAY. A LOT OF. REBUILT THE PROGRAM BOB OFFERS SOMEONE A TOP OF MIND YEAH. BIRBAL THEN THE OFFICE WITH FOR. HER FEATHER. FOR FIFTY YOU LOOK AT THE NEW YORK AVE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMITTEE RUN. SUMMARY GALLAGHER YEP JUST QUICKLY WANTED TO THANK THE SENATOR- FOR WORKING NOT BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE AND THIS IS. THE LATEST ITERATION- YOU KNOW AND APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU DO WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS I BROUGHT EVERYBODY TO THIS WORKING- YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY.

FIND A WAY TO MAKE THE SITUATION BETTER WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THESE LOSSES AND WENT AND THIS IS WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THIS IS HOW PEOPLE GET THEIR INFORMATION NOW I MEAN IS A- IS IT'S NOT JUST PHONES BUT IS YOUR INTERNET YOUR- ALL THESE THINGS AND- YOU KNOW THE FACTS NINE ONE ONE.
