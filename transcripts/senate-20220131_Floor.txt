THE SEAL BUMBLE WHICH IS A DATING APP AND WE LEARNED THAT THIS IS A REALLY- IT'S AN ISSUE THAT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN MORE AND MORE AND IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING TO STOP IT IT COULD LEAD TO TWO OTHER CRIMES ESPECIALLY ARGUES WHO ARE CONSTANTLY BOMBARDED BY THESE PREDATORS TRYING TO SEEK THEIR ATTENTION SO I'M REALLY THANKFUL THAT THIS HAS BEEN INTRODUCED AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW AS WE PASS LAWS THESE PERPETRATORS CONTINUE TO FIND YOU IN MORE CREATIVE WAYS OF STOCKING INTIMIDATING AND HARASSING.

SENATE BILL SIX TWENTY BY SENATOR ALAN AN ACT RELATING TO ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES. CENTER ALAN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS MEMBERS BOTH IN STATE AND OUT OF STATE WINE GROWERS HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO SELL AND SHIP. WINE DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX CALIFORNIA HAS ALLOWED IN STATE BREWERIES TO SHIP TO CONSUMERS FOR SEVERAL DECADES. IN ONE SERVICED SILVERLINE ING OF THIS PANDEMIC HAS BEEN THE DEVELOPMENT CREATIVE POLICY IDEAS SPURRED BY THE NEED TO ADJUST TO LIFE UNDER CODE RESTRICTIONS IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY. HOW DOES THIS PEOPLE WERE ADJUSTING TO LIFE WITH WITH- IT WILL BE THE END OF THE PANDEMIC IN THE NEED TO SPEND LESS TIME IN INDOOR SPACES WITH MANY OTHER PEOPLE ARE GOVERNOR GOT A NEW SIM DIRECTED THE DEPARTMENT ALCOHOL BEVERAGE CONTROL TO ALLOW FOR DIRECT TO CONSUMER. SHIPPING OF DISTILLED SPIRITS AT THE THREE BOTTLES PER DAY. THIS IS ONE OF SEVERAL POLICIES PUT IN PLACE TO RESPOND TO CONSUMER DEMAND IN THE SOCIALLY DISTANT ECONOMY AND WAS EXTENDED THROUGH THE END OF MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO JUST BEFORE- IS DONE JUST BEFORE NEW YEAR. TO HAVE THE STATE NOT INTERVENED AND ALLOWED FOR TEMPORARY ABILITY TO FOR DIRECT TO CONSUMER. SHIPPING OF DISTILLED SPIRITS MANY LOCAL DISTILLERIES MAY HAVE BEEN FORCED TO SHUT DOWN PERMANENTLY TO SUPPORT THESE CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES BY CREATING A BETTER SYSTEM ALL WHILE INCREASING ACCESS CONVENIENCE. AND SAFETY FOR CUSTOMERS IN PROTECTING WORKERS. SO THIS BILL SEEKS TO EXPAND MARKET ACCESS FOR. FOR DISTILLERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND ENSURE CONSUMER ACCESS TO SPECIALTY AND NICHE PRODUCTS NOT FOUND IN STORES. WE HAVE SEEN THE DIRECT TO CONSUMER MODEL WORK VERY EFFECTIVELY IN THE WINE AND BEER MARKETS. ARE AY OTHER STATES. IN CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC AND WE KNOW IT'S WHAT CONSUMERS WANT AND WE ALSO KNOW. THAT IT DOESN'T. HARM OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT THAT WORK IN THE DISTRIBUTION SPACE. THIS BILL WENT INTO PRINT- ALMOST A YEAR AGO MEMBERS. IT WAS THE SUBJECT OF AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING. IN NOVEMBER I FELT WE THE CHAIR OF THE GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION COMMITTEE ASKED US TO HOLD THE BILL BACK TO GIVE IT SOME MORE TIME. WE HAD A BIG INFORMATIONAL HEARING. IN NOVEMBER. AND BASED ON WHAT WE LEARNED DURING THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING WE LIMITED THE QUANTITY DISTILLED SPIRITS TO MIRROR. THE RULES THAT EXIST IN IN IN CERTAIN STATES. I'VE BEEN OPPOSITION CAME FORWARD DURING THE SENATE G. O. WE NEED FURTHER MEMBERS TO SIGNIFICANT LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF SPIRITS IT COULD BE SHIPPED. TO EACH INDIVIDUAL WE FURTHER LIMITED- WE LIMITED THE CRAFT DISTILLERS IN THE AMOUNT THAT THEY COULD SHIP FOR THE BIG GUYS ANY DISTILLER MAKING MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND GALLONS OF DISTILLED SPIRITS FOR YOUR TOTAL ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD. WOULD BE ONLY BE AUTHORIZED TO SHIP UP TO EIGHT. OR NINE LITERS PER YEAR THAT'S ABOUT A BOTTLE A PER MONTH TO INDIVIDUALS. AS PART OF A SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE. THE TOTAL VOLUME THEY COULD SHIP TO CONSUMERS EACH YEAR IN THE STATE WOULD BE CAPPED. AT A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND GALLONS. AND BY THE BY THE WAY MEMBERS THAT'S- PER LICENSE. PER DISTRIBUTOR LICENSE I'M SUPER DISTILLER LICENSE SO THAT'S NOT PRODUCT BY PRODUCT THAT'S THEIR ENTIRE INVENTORY. FOR A BIG DISTILLERY WE ALSO THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT I KNOW FOR A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS. WE NEED TO MANAGE TO ENSURE THAT ONLY COMMON CARRIERS. SO WITH YEAH I THINK UPS. DHL POSTAL SERVICE FEDEX. I WOULD BE ALLOWED TO HANDLE THE SHIPMENT OF THESE PRODUCTS. THESE MEMBERS WERE ALL BASED ON OPPOSITION CONCERNS REQUESTING THAT WE FOCUS THE BILL AND SUPPORTING CRAFT DISTILLERS. IN REQUIRE THE SHIPMENTS OCCUR THROUGH COMMON. CARRIERS I'VE SPOKEN TO MANYOF YOU I KNOW- THE CHAIRMAN DIED AS WELL. I REMAIN COMMITTED TO WORKING TO ADDRESS THE MAIN CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION DISTRIBUTORS. THAT WHAT I GOTTA SAY IT'S BEEN VERY VERY DIFFICULT. I'M HAPPY TO OPERATE FURTHER- IF PEOPLE HAVE QUESTIONS- BUT WE'RE TRYING TO ALTERNATELY TO CREATE PARITY WITHIN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM SUPPORTING CRAFT DISTILLERS. AND CONSUME- AND AN EXPANDING CONSUMER ACCESS. AND IT'S IN THAT SPIRIT THAT I RESPECT RESTAURANT VOTE I KNOW THAT. ARE THE JOINT AUTHORS- CHAIRMAN DODD WANTED TO. THANK YOU CENTER ALLEN MEMBERS DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE SENATOR DODD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ABOUT A PRESIDENT MEMBERS AS CHAIR AND GEO I WANTED TO PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND ON SB SIX TWENTY DISCUSS SOME OF OUR CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED. FIRST DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING IS NOTHING NEW THE WINE INDUSTRY HAS FOR DECADES HAVE THE ABILITY TO SHIP DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HAS BEEN ABLE TO SHIP THE CONSUMERS AND OTHER STATES AND VICE VERSA. WITH NO RESTRICTIONS. NO BOTTLE LIMITATIONS NO PRICE LIMITATIONS NO NOTHING. IN ADDITION CALIFORNIA BREWERIES REGARDLESS OF SIZE ARE CURRENTLY ALLOWED TO SHIP UNLIMITED AMOUNTS OF BEER DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NO I KNOW THE PURE PORSCHE THIS BILL. IS BEING REMOVED. WHEN HE COMES BACK HERE FOR CONCURRENCE BEER WILL NOT BE PART OF THIS. BILL AND I WANT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR TO EVERYBODY BECAUSE THE BEER INDUSTRY HAS SEEN THEIR WAY FIT. TO CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THIS BILL IN CALLING THE PEOPLE'S OFFICE REALLY. FRANKLY CONFUSING THE-SITUATION BECAUSE BOTH THE AUTHOR AND THAT I HAVE MADE IT CLEAR THAT BEER IS NOT GOING TO BE A PART OF THIS BILL. THIS IS BEEN GOING YOUR WITH YOUR- I'M JUST. CENTER ALLEN IS ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THIS I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT- I BRIEFLY WANT TO SPEAK UP ON. THE ABOUT THE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WELL WIDE IF HAS HAD THIS PRIVILEGE FOR DECADES. DIRECT TO CONSUMER SALES IN THE WINE INDUSTRY REPRESENTS LESS THAN. 2% OF WINE SALES DIRECT TO CONSUMERS LESS THAN 2% OF WINE SALES. IN IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE WHEN THAT WOULD THROUGH EVERYBODY BECAME WILDLY SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THE MARKET EXPANDED. AND PRODUCERS RETAILERS AND DISTRIBUTORS ALIKE WHO IS A RISING TIDE JERRY EVERYBODY WENT OUT. IT'S SIMPLE DIRECT TO CONSUMER SHIPPING FRANKLY IS EXPENSIVE. THE CONSUMER ALSO HAS TO WAIT FOR DAYS IF NOT WEEKS FOR THE PRODUCT TO ARRIVE WHAT IT DOES ARRIVE THE CONSUMER SOMEBODY OVER THE AGE TWENTY ONE HAS TO BE. THERE FOR THE PRODUCT IT'S JUST TOO CUMBERSOME COMPARED TO GOING TO THE LOCAL STORE AND PURCHASING THAT PRODUCT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS EXCLUSIVE PRODUCTS- IF YOU'LL ON THE MARKET. THE TO BE ABLE TO MOVE DIRECT TO CONSUMER AND OF COURSE OF THE PRODUCTS NOT AVAILABLE AT THE RETAILER IT GIVES THE CONSUMER AND THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ABOUT ITS CONSUMER CHOICE IT GIVES THE CONSUMER THE ABILITY. TO BUY SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD NOT OF NOT OTHERWISE HAVE ACCESS TO IT LAST YEAR WHEN A FISH BY EMPHASIZING A COUPLE THINGS- THIS ENTAILS CENTER. WITH THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES. HAS WORKED BILL. ON THIS EVEN THOUGH THE A LOT OF THE OPPOSITION. TALK TO THE OLD SEND OUT. BLAST EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU SAYING THAT HE READ IT OR HE HASN'T CALLED OR ANYTHING I'VE BEEN THERE FIRSTHAND WITH HIM WORKING HARD. EVERY STEP OF THE WAY- WE WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IS A COMMITMENT TO MOVE THIS BILL ALONG. SO THAT WE CAN MAKE IT A BETTER BILL IN THE ASSEMBLY BRING IT BACK OVER HERE WITH A BILL THAT EVERYBODY. CAN GET BEHIND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU CENTER DODD SIMILARLY MON. THANK YOU THE PRESIDENT I RISE AS A CO AUTHOR OF S. B. S. SIX TWENTY. IT'S A BILL THAT SUPPORTS US SMALL CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO A WIDER MARKET PLACE AND GIVING THEM MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO TRY ESPECIALLY JUNE PANDEMIC. IN MY DISTRICT I HAD THE CHANCE TO VISIT SOME OF THESE DISTILLERIES- WHERE PEOPLE ACTUALLY GO FOR TASTING AND WOULD LIKE TO PURCHASE- SOMETHING AND WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT ONLINE AND SO- IT'S BEEN IMPORTANT. AN IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR VERY SMALL AND FAMILY RUN BUSINESSES- THAT ARE PART OF OUR LOCAL ECONOMIES. I AM VERY HAPPY TO HEAR- A FROM THE- AUTHOR AND ALSO FROM OUR CHAIRMAN GOP THAT THERE IS EVERY INTENTION OF BRINGING BACK SOMETHING THAT WE CAN WORK WITH THAT I THINK THAT FOR MANY OF US. WHO SUPPORT THIS BILL WE'RE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW WE BRIDGE- SOME OF THIS DIVIDE THAT WE WOULD THAT WE'VE SEEN IT WITH OUR LEVER BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND THAT WE AVOID SOME OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WHETHER IT'S A SMALL DISTILLERIES IS VERSUS THE BIG ONES OR WHETHER IT'S THE TYPE OF ALCOHOL. CERTAINLY THIS IS NOT EASY AND GRATEFUL TO BOTH OF THE AUTHORS- AND I'M VERY HOPEFUL THAT IN THE NEXT ROUND IN THE NEXT REITERATION OF THIS BILL WE WILL SEE A BILL- THAT WILL HAVE A HOPEFULLY LABOR NEUTRAL OR IN SUPPORT OF THIS- AND SO WITH THAT TODAY I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AS A CO AUTHOR AND LOOK FORWARD TO SOME RESOLUTION. THANK YOU SENATOR LIMÓN. SENATOR ALSO. THANK YOU MAY PRESIDENT I OUT OF STATE DISTILLERY BUSINESSES HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM GETTING THEIR PRODUCTS TO MARKET. AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THE LARGE DISTILLERS WOULD SELL TO PUT CONSUMERS AND BYPASS THE DISTRIBUTORS AND DELIVER UP TO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND GALLONS OF THEIR PRODUCTS PER YEAR. THAT TRANSLATES INTO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BOTTLES PER YEAR DIRECT TO CONSUMER BY PASSING GOOD JOBS UNDERMINING SALES AT GROCERY STORES AND OTHER LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES. FOR THIS REASON IT APPEARS TO BE ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO DE REGULATE ALCOHOL SALES I LIKE ALL THE REGULATION EFFORTS IT IS BOUND TO BE DISASTROUS FOR THE WORK FORCE. I UNDERSTAND AN AMENDMENT WAS PROPOSED WITH CRAFT DISTILLERS THAT WOULD HAVE CREATED A DIRECT TO CONSUMER PRIVILEGE FOR MOM AND POP DISTILLERIES WITHOUT A SOLUTION THAT PROTECTS GOOD LOCAL JOBS AND LOCAL BUSINESSES I WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR DORADO SENATOR COLLAR. THANK YOU CENTER ALAN. THANK YOU- KAMLAGER THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WILL- UNFORTUNATELY BE LAYING OFF THIS BILL TODAY- I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR. WOW ESERVERS INCREDIBLY RIGHTEOUS ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS ALL THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN COMING AT HIM FROM ALL SIDES FOR- WEEKS NOW AND CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT WE WILL GET TO THE FINISH LINE WITH SOMETHING THAT MAKES SENSE FOR EVERYONE ESPECIALLY OUR SMALL CRAFT DISTILLERIES AND- ARE CONSUMERS CONCERNS- NGO OUT WHEN THIS BILL WAS HEARD- AND OFFERED A COURTESY VOTE TO KEEP THE DISCUSSIONS GOING AND HAVE BEEN MONITORING THEM- AS THINGS HAVE PROGRESSED YOU KNOW I- AND CONCERN THAT THE BILL DOES NOT INCLUDE COMMON CARRIER WITH EMPLOYEES LANGUAGE AND I AM ALSO DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT IT CONTINUES TO HAVE- BIG DISTILLERIES IN IT I KNOW THAT THEY GOT A HAIR CUT BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT LARGE. ENTITIES AND CORPORATIONS- EVEN WHEN THERE ARE CAPS THERE ARE WAYS TO WORK AROUND THE CAPS IT IS JUST TRUE AND I HAD A REALLY HEARTFELT CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR WHO TALKED TO ME ABOUT THE INTENT BEHIND THIS BILL AND WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT SMALL CRAFT DISTILLERIES. AND WHILE THE HIGH TIDE RISES ALL BOATS- IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT WHEN THAT HAPPENS YOU KNOW MOST OF THE BOUNTY GOES TO LARGER COMPANIES- AND SO I WOULD PREFER IF WE SEPARATE THIS IN HOUSE SOMETHING THAT FOCUSES ON BG CRAFT DISTILLERIES AND THEN HAVE SOMETHING THAT FOCUSES ON SMALL BUSINESSES BECAUSE SO OFTEN WE SAY WE'RE DOING THIS FOR THE LITTLE GUY WE'RE DOING THIS FOR THE LITTLE GUY. AND THEN THE BIG GUYS SEE AN OPPORTUNITY AND THEY JUMP ON TO THE BANDWAGON AND THEN AS A RESULT THERE ARE A LOT OF CHANGES THAT HAPPEN. TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE SIZED INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS AND DIFFERENT CHALLENGES THAN OUR SMALL MOM AND POPS THAT ARE OFTENTIMES STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE AND I SURMISE BECAUSE I HAVE TALKED TO SOME OF THEM WOULD LIKE SOMETHING pI AM DISTURBED THAT WE ARE PAINTING YOU KNOW WORKERS% AGAINST WORKERS AND SO THAT IS ALSO WHY YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THIS BILL HAVE DIFFERENT LANGUAGE IN AND AROUND. COMMON CARRIER WITH EMPLOYEES AND BECAUSE I KNOW. I AM ALSO VERY GRATEFUL TO HEAR THAT THE NEXT TIME WE WILL SEE IT YOU KNOW BEER WILL NOT BE IN THIS YOU KNOW BEER AND WINE AND SPIRITS. THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT KIND OF CONSTELLATIONS AND SO IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE FOR US TO TRY TO YOU KNOW ADDRESS THEM- DIFFERENTLY SO I HAVE IMMENSE SUPPORT AND- RESPECT FOR. THE AUTHOR IN A SUPPORT HIM- IN HIS EFFORTS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO VOTE FOR THIS WHEN IT COMES BACK WHEN SOME OF THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER CALL MARKER WILL NEXT GO TO SENATOR DOLLY. SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS A GOOD TO BE BACK I WANTED JUST TO DISABILITY AND- BOTH OPPOSITION INNOCENT AND THE SUPPORT OF- TALK TO ME IN DEPTH AND- NO I WANTED TO SHARE SOME MY THOUGHTS ON. SOMETHING TAT'S NOT IN THE BILL'S NOT TALKED ABOUT AT ALL AND THAT IS- SOMEBODY REPRESENTS A LOT OF SMALL. COMMUNITIES IN CITIES AND WHERE WE'VE SEEN. THE ABILITY FOR DIRECT MARKETING STRAIGHT TO YOUR HOME. IN THIS CASE THIS WOULD BE HAPPENING AS WELL. BUT WE SEE WITH AMAZON WE SEE WITH COSCO WE SEE WITH A LOT OF RETAIL. DISTRIBUTORS AND THEN THE TAX BASE. DOESN'T GET COLLECTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND THAT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT- I KNOW THE SENATOR- A GLAZER HAD BEEN WORKING ON WE TALKED ABOUT THAT LAST YEAR BUT- WHAT FUND YOUR CITY IS SALES TAX. AND YOUR SMALL TOWNS. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND NOT SALES TAX PROVIDES SERVICES IN THOSE CITIES AND COMMUNITIES. FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR PARKS FOR ALL THE THINGS THAT THOSE BASICALLY CITIES REALLY RELY ON SALES TAX MORE MEANING THE COUNTIES. HAVE PROPERTY TAX AND SO I TALK TO THE AUTHOR- AND I TALKED TO- THE SENATOR DODD ABOUT THE ISSUES. THAT ARE QUE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SO TODAY I AND I'M NOW BACK TO THE BILL. THE WHAT'S IN THE BILL- WE HAVE SMALL DISTRIBUTORS WE HAVE LARGEST JANITORS IN. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SMALL- COMPANIES ARE MADE WHOLE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF. ROOM TO WORK ON THIS BILL. AND SO TODAY I'M GONNA SUPPORT THE BILL BUT I WANT TO GO ON RECORD THAT IF IT DOESN'T COME BACK. WITH THE AMENDMENTS IT NEEDS FROM THE OTHER HOUSE- I WON'T BE SUPPORTING IT THEN AN IDEA DOES NEED SOME WORK BEFORE I'LL BE ABLE TO- CONTINUES SUPPORT SO FOR THOSE REASONS I. WILL LET THE BILL I'LL BE VOTING AYE ON THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU CENTER DOLLING MAKES WE'RE GOING TO GO TO SEND OVER BRADFORD IS PARTICIPATING REMOTELY SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO LEND MY VOICE TO THIS ISSUE AND I WANT ALSO RECOGNIZE YOUR GREAT WORK THAT. OUR GENDER ALLEN AND SENATOR DODD IS DONE ON THIS MEASURE BUT I TO HAVE. GREAT CONCERNS AS A INDIVIDUAL WHO HAVE. DISTRIBUTORS BREWERIES AND- STILLER'S AND DISTRICT I'VE GOT OPPORTUNITY HAVE A LOT OF DIALOGUE REGARDING THIS ISSUE AND THEY STILL EXPRESS A LOT OF CONCERN HOW ARE WE- THIS BILL STARTED OUT. OUR DÍAS THE BILL TO HELP SMALL CRAFT. PRODUCTS IS VITALLY IMPORTANT AND WE SAW THE BENEFIT OF THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER LAST YEAR THAT HELPED MANY OF THESE BUSINESSES TO KEEP THEIR DOORS OPEN AND PEOPLE EMPLOYED. BUT THIS BILL IS WORKED INTO SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT AND H. QUITE CHALLENGING WHEN I HEAR FROM THOSE ENTITIES ARE MY COMMUNITY WHO WERE FEARFUL OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO THEIR BOTH BUSINESS. IF THE BIG GUYS ARE ALLOWED TO PLAY AT THE DEGREE THAT THEY ARE REGARDLESS OF WHAT AMOUNT THAT IS RIGHT NOW SO OF THE- ARE NOT ABLE TO PULL. BECAUSE OF MY- REMO PURCHASE A TODAY I STILL TO VOICE MY CONCERN. OF THE LEVEL ONE READING AS YOU ARE. FOR THIS AGAIN I DID A BILL A COUPLE YEARS AGO TO HELP THE SMALL BREWERIES- ENABLE TO SEE STILL MORE PRODUCTS DIRECTLY SO I'M TOTALLY ARE IN SUPPORT OF. WHAT THIS BILL IS ATTENDING TO DO ARE TEMPTING TO DO OUR SHOULD SAY BUT RIGHT NOW WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US THIS FAR MORE THAN THAT IT'S- IT'S OPENING UP A- FLOODGATE TO ALLOW. THE BIG GUYS ONLY TO GET BIGGER AND FOR THOSE REASONS I JUST I'M NOT READY AND I'M GONNA. HOPEFULLY AGAIN IF IT GETS BACK TO OUR FLOOR IT'LL BE A BILL THAT REALLY. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD. CENTRE HER TADO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. USUALLY BILLS LIKE THIS I JUST STAND UP AND USUALLY SUPPORT BUT ON THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS AT JUST AFTER DOING MY OWN RESEARCH I WANTED TO EXPRESS BUT ALSO TO ASK OF THE AUTHOR- A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR. YOU KNOW THIRTY CURRENTLY WE HAVE GAPS IN FOOD SERVICE AND- CENTER TOTALEMENT. CENTER ALAOUI TAKE A QUESTION THANK YOU FOR SEATS ENTERED HER TADO. SO WE CURRENTLY HAVE GAPS IN OUR FOOD SURVEILLANCE WHICH BECOMES EVENTUALLY FOOD SAFETY ISSUE. I KNOW THERE WASN'T A STUDY THAT WAS CONDUCTED JUST LAST YEAR AND TWENTY TWENTY ACTUALLY THAT- THAT CAME OUT THAT SET THE 470-006-0060 LEADERS OF FAKE WHISKY IN NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED LITERS OF COUNTERFEIT ALCOHOL FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF. FRAUDULENT SPIRITS- IT SEEMS LIKE THE E. U. HAS A LITTLE BIT OF A OF A PROBLEM IN THIS AREA- IT. SOME OF THE COUNTERFEIT ALCOHOL PROBLEM THE ISSUE THE ISSUE HAS BEEN FACING. INCLUDES UP TO TWENTY TWO DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. AND SO MY QUESTION THE AUTHOR IS WHAT REGULATORY PROTECTIONS ARE IN PLACE TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO FIX THE EXPANSION. PLEASE PROCEED CENTER ALAN YEAH I THINK THE CHAIRMAN COULD PROBABLY SPEAK A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME THERE WERE SOME LANGUAGE THAT- THAT WAS WORKED ON WITH GEO BUT- I'M I MEAN THE END OF THE DAY- THAT. WE'VE NOT SEEN THIS PROBLEM- IN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE DONE THIS- I'M HAPPY TO LOOK AT AND LANGUAGE IF YOU REALLY WANT TO TIGHTEN IT UP FURTHER ON ON ON THIS WHOLE QUESTION OF COUNTERFEIT- BUT- IT- I WERE TOTALLY TOTALLY CENTER WHAT. HOW EXACTLY HAS THIS PROBLEM. MANAGEMENT AS A. SEVENTY YEAR THE IMMINENT EVEN ALLUDING TO. PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU. IT JUST SEEMS TO ME LIKE THIS IS IT THIS IS FOOD FOOD SAFETY. IS AN AREA WHERE WE DON'T REALLY PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO BUT IT'S BECOMING MORE AND MORE OF AN ISSUE. AND SO WHEN YOU. OPEN UP THE MARKET WHICH IS ON THE I DON'T THINK IT'S NECESSARILY A BAD THING. I WOULD STILL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE FRAMEWORK IN PLACE SO THAT WERE PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND THAT THERE. ISN'T ANY A COUNTERFEIT- I MEAN THE TRUTH IS THAT NOBODY COULD SELL IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE A OF A LICENSE TO SELL THROUGH THE MECHANISM ON THIS BILL AND ANYBODY WHO ENGAGES IN A KIND OF FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOR YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WOULD GET. DING DID CERTAINLY NOT ONLY WOULD THEY HAVE THEIR LICENSE REVOKED I MEAN MAYBE A FOR CRIMINAL CHARGES. AND SO I AS I SAY YOU KNOW IF THERE'S IF THERE'S SOME LANGUAGE WE CAN TAKE TO. FURTHER UNDERSCORE THAT I'M I'M HAPPY TO- TOOK TOOK TO LOOK AT IT THIS IS WHAT A. B. C. DOES ALL THE TIME I MEAN IT YEAH THEY THEY THEY THEY WILL COME DOWN LIKE A TON OF BRICKS ON ANYBODY WHO. ENGAGES IN THE KIND OF BEHAVIOR THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT. I'M NOT SURE IF THE CHAIR. WOULD LIKE TO LIVE. THE SENATE REGARDED YOU ALSO RESPOND AS A CO AUTHOR. YES JUST. JUST QUICKLY. COUNTERFEIT ALCOHOL SALES ARE ILLEGAL. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ANYWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. HE SAID- YEAH THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO. SOME OF THE OPPOSITION- ON THIS IS. YOU KNOW HOW DO WE- GET TO THE POINT THAT WE CAN. MAKE THIS WE'VE NEVER ADDRESSED THAT ISSUE BECAUSE THAT IS IT'S CLEARLY ILLEGAL. BUT ANYBODY THAT SHIPS IN THE INTO THE IN YOU KNOW IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I THINK TO BE A PERMIT PROCESS IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. SO THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE. WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM. NO ONE UNDERSTANDS- SHIPPING. INTO THE STATE. AND FINALLY. ANYBODY THAT WITH THEIR INTENTIONS THEY WOULD BE KNOWN BY. THE CALIFORNIA- EBC HER TADO DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. NOT AT THE MOMENT I JUST AT MY CLOSET AT LIKE TO SAY THAT WE HAVE SEEN AT LEAST FROM MY UNDERSTANDING THROUGH THE FTA THAT THERE ARE LETTERS THAT HAVE GONE OUT WHERE THERE'S SOME. SITUATIONS THAT ARE JUST NOT NECESSARILY- TRANSPARENT WHERE THERE'S CONCERN OF ABUSE IN OUR FOOD SAFETY SYSTEM AND SO I THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'LL CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT AND I'M HOPING THAT. THE AUTHORS WILL MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROTECT OUR CALIFORNIANS OBVIOUSLY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOUR OFFICE AND WITH THE SENATOR- BECAUSE THERE'S- THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS TO DO ANYTHING IN THIS BILL THAT WOULD- WHICH WOULD HARM PUBLIC SAFETY FOOD SAFETY. THANK YOU CENTER TITLES THANK YOU SENATOR ALAN CENTER SKINNER WAS IN A SITUATION LAST WEEK BRYCE PRESENTING A BILL. WHICH HAD SOME PROBLEMS THAT NEEDED TO WORK OUT AND DIE. WHEN MY PRESENTATION. AND ASKED FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO MOVE THE BILL TO ENABLE ME TO DO THAT AND I ARTICULATED WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING. IN THIS WE HAVE A SITUATION HERE WHERE THERE ARE STILL SOME THINGS TO BE WORKED OUT- THE- THE COMIC CARE YOUR ISSUE IS OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THEM. AND I'VE HEARD A COMMITMENT ON THAT. AND SO I FEEL THAT THE NUMBER ONE. THE SMALL DISTILLERS DEFINITELY NEED TO BE SUPPORTED TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS TYPE OF DIRECT CONSUMER SALE ANY OTHER ISSUE AS MUCH AS I. REALLY HAVE. BEEN VERY UNHAPPY THAT WE THAT AS A SOCIETY IS COMMERCE HAS MOVED TO SO SIGNIFICANTLY ONLINE SALES AND WE'VE SEEN BRICK AND MORTAR. INFECTED DYING AND WE BUT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT LIKE MANY OF OUR LAND USE POLICIES ARE BASED AROUND BRICK AND MORTAR OR SALES TAX POLICY SO MUCH. AND YET THE REALITY IS THAT THINGS ARE MOVING AWAY FROM THAT SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RE THINK SO MUCH IN ORDER TO BRING BACK THE KIND EQUITY THAT ALL OF US HAVE IN MIND FOR OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR OUR RETAILERS FOR EVERYONE. IT FOR CONSUMER PROTECTION BUT I DON'T THINK TO PUT THAT ON THIS BILL LOAN I THINK IS SOMEWHAT IS UNFAIR BUT I AM GOING TO DO THAT. LEAPOF FAITH THAT THE AUTHOR AND THE VARIOUS PLAYERS INVOLVED IN THIS BILL WILL NEGOTIATE IN GOOD FAITH AND WILL BRING US BACK SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE FEEL BETTER ABOUT WITHOUT I WILL VOTE ON. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT OF WILL MEMBERS FIRST OF ALL I'M VERY CLEAR THAT THIS BILL STARTED OFF WITH MANY DEFICIENCIES I THINK RECALL ALL AGREE ON THAT AND BECAUSE OF THAT I WASN'T AND FAVOR OF THIS BILL AND I. STARTED OUT WORKING WITH SOME OF OUR LABOR FRIENDS TRYING TO ENSURE THAT WE FOCUS ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY CARED ABOUT AND I WOULD JUST SAY SPEAK FOR MYSELF BASED ON THE MANY MANY HOURS I SPENT AT THE AUTHOR HE CAN ATTEST IT IS NOT ONLY EVENING WEEKENDS WE WERE ON THE PHONE ALL THE TIME. I FELT THAT I AT LEAST WHAT WAS ABLE TO GET SOME OF THE LARGER ITEMS THAT THEY WERE CONCERNED WITH TOM AND AT NO TIME DID I HEAR NO EVERY TIME I PRESENTED SOMETHING THAT LABOR WANTED HE WOULD BE AGREEABLE TO- UNFORTUNATE SOME POINT THEY OPTED TO DIRECTLY NEGOTIATE WITH THE AUTHOR OR NOT SO QUE- BUT AS- I SAW IT THERE IS A LOT OF WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE INDICATING CONTENT AGREEMENT BUT I'M COMFORTABLE AND CONFIDENT BASED ON ALL THE HOURS WE SPENT ON THIS AND SEE HOW MUCH WE'VE MOVED THE NEEDLE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY IS THERE TO MAKE THIS BILL REID AND CELL WITH THAT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR. RUBIO CENTER NIELSEN. BETTER PRESENT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN SENATE. OVER THE YEARS I'VE BEEN A LOT OF THESE. CONTROVERSIAL OR HEAVILY DEBATED HEAVILY AMENDED BILLS. BUT I'VE LEARNED TO BE WARY. NOT AS MUCH ABOUT TODAY. S. TOMORROW AND NEXT YEAR. AND WAY IT OFTEN GOES ARE TAKEN. TO SECURE SUPPORT FOR TODAY. AND THE BILL PASSES. GOES INTO LAW. AND THEN IT SEALED IMAGE AND TAKE A MILE NEXT YEAR WE COME BACK WITH A WHOLE NEW ARRAY OF ARGUMENTS. TO EXPAND THE SCOPE AND SOME ONE PARTY OR ANOTHER MAY WANT TO BE. DOES THAT SAY THAT THERE IS A LACK OF TRUST YES THERE ABSOLUTELY IS. NOT OF THE AUTHOR. I HAVE NO CONCERN ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR AUTHORED WHATSOEVER. BUT THE INSTITUTION I DO. IN THE YEARS THAT I WAS GONE AND I CAME BACK AND PEOPLE SAID JIM MUCH DIFFERENT. THE LEGISLATURE BEEN GONE EIGHTEEN YEARS WHAT'S DIFFERENT. I SAID RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER. AND RESPECT FOR THE INSTITUTION AND THE RULES THERE ARE HAVE GREATLY DIMINISHED. NOW THE THIRD HOUSE THEY GET THAT. THEN THEY DO A MAGNIFICENT JOB OF. ADVOCATING FOR THEIR CLIENTS. EL ALL SIDES ARE DOING SO ON THIS VERY BILL. BUT TO ME. I'M WARY OF NEXT YEAR. AND THAT NEXT STEP THAT WILL NOT MAY BE TAKEN I REGIONAL. THANK YOU SENATOR NELSON CENTER PORCHES. HELLO GOOD PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE. FROM MY STANDPOINT SEEMS THAT. THERE'S TWO SIDES OF THIS COIN YOU HAVE A MERITORIOUS NEED. AND THEN YOU HAVE WHAT IS INEVITABLY A TURF WAR. NOW THE MERITORIOUS NEED IS THE FACT THAT WE WANT TO HELP I THINK EVERYBODY HERE WOULD AGREE WE WANT TO HELP THE SMALL BATCH DISTILLERIES. THE TURF WAR IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT COIN COIN. WHERE YOU HAVE- MAJOR DISTRIBUTORS AND MAJOR PRODUCERS- WANTING TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THERE'S NOT THE PROVERBIAL NOSE UNDER THE TENT. I HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO HIM- THAT. WE'RE BEING ASKED TO VOTE ON A BILL THAT IN OF ITSELF DOESN'T SEEM. ON REASONABLE SHIPPING ITS SIZE. BUT I THINK ALL OF US UNDERSTAND. THAT THAT SIZE WILL INCREASE IN MODIFY OVER TIME. MEYER I HAVE THE HIGHEST RESPECT FOR THE SENATOR FROM SANTA MONICA AND THE SENATOR FROM NAPA BOTH OF WHOM I THINK ARE MEN OF THEIR WORD AND ARE DOING A YEOMAN'S JOB TRYING TO SPEARHEAD THIS ISSUE. I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE EARLIER WITH THE COMMENTS FROM THE SENATOR FROM LOS ANGELES THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS RIPE FOR BIFURCATION. THAT WE HAVE A VOTE. ON THE MERITS OF THE SUPPORTING SMALL BATCH DISTILLERY OPPORTUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE'VE ALL LEARNED THE LESSONS OF COVERT. THERE AE BENEFITS ARE THAT CAN BE HAD BOTH ON THE CONSUMER SIDE AND ON THE PRODUCTION SIDE ESPECIALLY THOSE IN NEED AND THOSE ARE THE SMALL BATCH FOLKS IS GOING TO BE A TURF WAR OF THE TIER SYSTEM. WILL THERE BE A DOMINANCE A MONOPOLY IN THE DISTRIBUTION OUR SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN AROUND FOREVER. NOW ARGUMENTS I MADE IN G. O. WHEN WE WERE DOING WITH THIS AND I HAVE STAINED AT THAT POINT AND I HAVE TO CONFESS- I'M INCLINED TO ABSTAIN IN THIS SITUATION BECAUSE WE'RE COMBINING TWO ISSUES. THAT ON THE- ON THEIR MERITS SHOULD BE SEPARATED. I WOULD LOVE IF THEY WOULD JUST THIS BILL ON ON DISTILLERIES I THINK IT WOULD BE A FORTY YO. NOW MOVING INTO THE OTHER MORE DIFFICULT THING IS HOW DO YOU HOW DO WE INVOLVE THE TIER SYSTEM. BECAUSE THERE SHOULD BE SOME CAPACITY FOR PRODUCERS TO MAIL DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS. BUT YOU ALSO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR DECADES UPON DECADES UPON DECADES IN ALL THE LOGISTICS AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT TRANSPORTATION EMPLOYEE BLOCKS. YOU CAN'T JUST SIMPLY ON DO THAT OVERNIGHT AND I KNOW THAT THIS BILL SOUNDS LIKE YOU WOULDN'T BE ON DOING IT OVERNIGHT BUT IT WILL IMMEDIATELY BEGIN THAT PROCESS OF BOTH SIDES GOING TO THEIR CORNERS IN DUKING IT OUT- THE VOLUME THAT CAN BE TRANSPORTED. THROUGH DIRECT CONSUMER SALES WHAT UNDOUBTEDLY INCREASE SORT PUSHING OFF THE INEVITABLE. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AND OF COURSE YOU WANT TO PASS IT TODAY AND THEN- IT IT'S GOING TO BE OFF TO THE RACES IN THE ASSEMBLY. IF THIS WERE TO BE BIFURCATED I WOULD BE SO PROUD TO CAST A VOTE IN FAVOR OF PROMOTING SMALL BATCH DISTILLERY- CONSUMER SALES. AND THE NEXT BATTLE WHICH WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE A POLITICAL WAR WE ALL KNOW THAT. LET THE MERITS OF THAT DEBATE UNFOLD. IN LET'S GO AFTER THE TIER SYSTEM FOR WHAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE ANTIQUATED BUT YOU CAN'T JUST ON DO IT WITHOUT A HIGH DEGREE OF FOR NON PREPARATION PRECAUTION. IN TIMELINE TO RESPECT THE INVESTMENT THAT PEOPLE IN THE INDUSTRY HAVE MADE. ARE NOT JUST NOW BUT IN THE DECADES PAST. THANK YOU CENTER BORDERS MEMBERS ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR ALLEN YOU MAY CLOSE I'M SORRY BUT- IRAN ONE MOMENT CENTRO TROUBLE YOU GOT ME THERE AT THE LAST SECOND PLEASE PROCEED. I APOLOGIZE MADAM CHAIR. SO IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT- THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE HARDEST BOATS OR THAT I WILL NOT MAKE THEM ON THIS FLOOR AS A NEW MEMBERS ONE OF THE NEWEST MEMBERS HERE. BEEN TRYING TO BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS BOTH HERE- WITH MY COLLEAGUES AS FAR AS THE TRUST. AND THE GOOD WILL AND GOOD FAITH IN NEGOTIATING WITH THE BILLS. AND TAKING THE COUNCIL FROM EVERYBODY IN TRYING TO REPRESENT MY DISTRICT- THE BEST THAT I CAN I AM LISTENING TO THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE- IN MY DISTRICT ON THAT END. THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I DIDN'T REALLY REASSURED HERE TODAY IS THE FACT THAT I AM INCREDIBLY. PLEASED TO HEAR THAT THERE HAS BEEN CON CONVERSATIONS IN A GO SHE ASIANS IN THE PROCESS AND TRYING TO ADDRESSED. OF MANY OF THE CONCERNS WITHIN THIS BILL AND THE WILLINGNESS OF THE AUTHOR TO- TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS AND I ACTUALLY EVEN I'M VERY PLEASED WITH THAT. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES THAT THIS BILL. WILL NOT INCLUDE. IT WILL BE DIVIDED INTO JUST ADDRESSING THE ISSUES WITH OUR SMALL DISTILLERIES AND THAT THEY WILL BE NARROWED LANGUAGE- AND THAT AT THE BEER WILL NOT. ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT BE. INCLUDED IN THIS NISPEL. IS THAT A QUESTION CENTER GO TO STAY- JUST. BURKE THANK YOU. OUR QUESTION I GUESS THANK OKAY SENATOR ALAN WE TAKE A QUESTION YES ABSOLUTELY I'M SEED SO ABS ARE YOU'VE HEARD BOTH OF US. IN LOCKHART COMMITMENT THAT BEER IS OUT OF THE BILL. ON THE ISSUE THAT BOTH YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUE- ARE FROM FRESNO REYES WITH REGARDS TO SMALL DISTILLERIES. ABSENT OVER OVER AGAIN THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN MY FOCUS. ARE WE ARE AT A POINT OF RIGHT NOW RIGHT NOW WITH REGARDS TO THE BIG FOLKS. ARE WILL ALL THE BILL ALLOWS FOR IS THERE'S A THERE'S A THERE'S AN ANNUAL CAP THAT CAN BE SHIPPED IN A YEAR AND ALSO THE TOTAL THAT CAN BE SHIPPED. TO AN INDIVIDUAL. I HAVE SO NINE LEADERS TO AN INDIVIDUAL PER YEAR. HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND GALLONS STATEWIDE FOR THAT THAT DISTILLER'S LICENSE. I'M NASH ARE A BY THE WAY WOULD HAVE TO BE THROUGH A SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE NOW WE HAVE GONE TO THE OPPOSITION ARE IN THE- OUR INTEREST IS TO FOCUS ON PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN IN THE RETAIL STORES RIGHT SO THERE ARE SOME PRODUCTS SOME SPECIALTY PRODUCTS THAT ARE PRODUCED BY THE BIG GUYS THAT ARE SIMPLY NOT SOLD ON ON STORE SHELVES AND IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ECONOMIC SENSE FOR THEM TO BE SOLD ON SARCELLES BECAUSE THEY DON'T MOVE AT A VERY FAST CLIP. THAT'S REALLY OUR FOCUS FOR THEM I WE HAVE GIVEN IDEA AFTER IDEA AFTER IDEA TO THE DISTRIBUTORS AND THEY HAVE SHOT EVERY SINGLE ONE DOWN WE SAID HEY CAN YOU COME BACK WITH SOME LANGUAGE THAT MIGHT WORK THE ANSWER OVER AND OVER AGAIN HAS BEEN NO IN THE END OF THE DAY THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY MECHANISM FOR THEM TO BE A PART OF THIS BILL EVEN FOR THOSE PRODUCTS THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN THE RETAIL I I'D THAT STORES AROUND OUR STATE. ARE YOU KNOW SO THAT'S MY DILEMMA HERE- SENATOR HE'S IS THE IS THE IS JUST THE LACK OF COOPERATION- AND IDEAS FROM THEM WITH REGARDS TO SOME SORT OF LANGUAGE THAT MIGHT MEET THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE EXPRESSED AND THAT THEY HAVE EXPRESSED BECAUSE THE END OF THE DAY WE UNDERSTAND THEIR CENTRAL ARGUMENT WHICH IS THAT THEY DON'T WANT PRODUCTS THAT ARE GOING TO COMPETE WITH THEIR PRODUCTS THE COMPLETE ANY ANY PRODUCT THAT IS REGULAR SOLD IN STORES OF COURSE IS GOING TO COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS- SO WE'VE WORKED TO GET THAT LANGUAGE OUT. A BUT BUT THEY YOU KNOW THEY THEY'E JUST NOT IN A PLACE WHERE THEY'VE BEEN WILLING TO ACCEPT ANYTHING OR EVEN GIVE US ANY ANY ANY AMENDMENTS THAT THAT THEY MEET THE GOALS THAT WE HAVE FOR THOSE SPECIALTY PRODUCTS THAT'S THE DILEMMA THAT. WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. AND- YOU KNOW I'M JUST. THAT WILL BE ABLE THAT THAT IF WE GET THIS OUT OF THE SENATE FLOOR WILL WILL BE ABLE TO WORK IT OUT. I'M YOU KNOW OVER TO SIMPLY COMMITTEE. SENATOR BOB THAT'S GOOD. OKAY% VERY GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER ALEXANDER WILK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I STAND IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX TWENTY. THIS IS A PRO CONSUMER BILL I'D I AGREE WE WANT TAKE CARE OF OUR SMALL CRAFT DISTILLERS AND THERE IS A TURF WAR GOING ON- FOR THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM MY PROBLEM IS. SUPPORTING MY CONSTITUENTS WANT AND THEY WANT CHOICE IN IN CHOICE IN THE MARKETPLACE WE ARE HERE TODAY AT THIS ARBITRARY DEADLINE BECAUSE OF THE GOOD FAITH FITH OF THE AUTHOR WHO HELD IT. AT THE REQUEST OF ALL PARTIES I'VE SAID ON GEO SO I WAS THERE FOR THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING IN NOVEMBER WHICH I LEARNED A GREAT DEAL ABOUT. AND THIS IS THIS IS A NEEDED NEEDED REFORM. I'VE WORKED WITH MANY I'VE WORKED ON MANY TOUGH ISSUES WITH THE SENATOR FROM SANTA MONICA PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO. LET ALEXION REFORM AND HE'S KEPT HIS WORD EVERY TIME. I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE IN HONOR FOR MANY YEARS TO BE THE VICE CHAIR OF GEO WITH. WITH THE DISTINGUISHED SENATOR FROM NAPA AND HE'S ALWAYS KEPT HIS WORD. SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT THAT I STILL WOULD LIKE TO SEE- NARROWED IN THE BILL WHICH I'VE SHARED WITH BOTH THOSE GENTLEMEN. I BELIEVE THAT IT WILL HAPPEN IF YOU WANTTO BRING PEOPLE TO THE TABLE TO GET A BILL THAT WORKS FOR ALL PARTIES WE HAVE TO GET IT OUT OF THIS HOUSE TODAY. BECAUSE THEN THE SERIES NEGOTIATION BEGINS AGAIN AT THIS BILL COMES BACK IN THIS TOO BROAD I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SOME SUPPORT IT BUT I BELIEVE THESE GENTLEMEN. AND I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO GET ACROSS THE FINISH LINE AND ULTIMATELY THIS IS TO HELP. OUR CONSTITUENTS BACK HOME HAVE CHOICE IN THE MARKETPLACE SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WELCOME MEMBERS FURTHER DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING NONE SIR ALAN YOU MAY CLOSE. JUST REALLY APPRECIATE THE ROBUST DISCUSSION. AND WE REALLY HAVE BEEN TRYING HARD TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE WE CAN GET THIS. BILL SO WE WOULDN'T OF HAD TO HAVE THIS KIND OF FIGHT HERE IS THE SORT OF DISCUSSION THIS UNCERTAINTY. ON THIS. ON THIS FLOOR. ARE YOUR FRIENDS IN LABOR ARE TAKING CUES FROM THEIR EMPLOYERS TO DISTRIBUTORS. OUR DISTRIBUTORS JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE ANY CHANGES. TO THE CURRENT LAW UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE AND THEY JUST MADE IT REALLY CLEAR TO US- AND THAT'S BEEN OUR CHALLENGE THAT'S BEEN OUR TALENTS- SO WITH THAT I ASK THAT YOU GIVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO. TO GO OVER THE SIMPLY. SEE IF WE CAN GET THESE ISSUES ADDRESSED IF WE CAN'T THAT'S NOT COMING BACK. ARE YOU KNOW IN THE END OF THE DAY I WITH THE BIGGEST PORTIONS OF THE BILL I THINK OF THE ISSUES THAT PEOPLE SEEM TO AGREE WITH. OUR OUR OUR OUR OUR VERY MERITORIOUS THERE'S A FEW SMALL ISSUES THAT. ARE JUST. PRICKLY AND WE'RE JUST HOPING WE CAN GET THEM ADDRESSED WITH THE OPPOSITION TO GET IT BACK. OVER HERE BUT- I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S. THE DISCUSSION I.

PAN ROTH STERN SENATE REMOVES THE CALL MEMBERS WE ARE NOW MOVING ON TO FILE ITEM NUMBER NINE SENATOR CORTESE MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL TWO THIRTEEN BY SENATOR CORTEZ HE AN ACT RELATING TO WORKERS COMPENSATION OF A RISE TODAY 2% SB TWO THIRTEEN WHICH WILLCREATE A STREAMLINED ELIGIBILITY FOR WORKER'S COMPENSATION FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES PROVIDE DIRECT PATIENT CARE IN ACUTE HOSPITAL SETTINGS AND FACE A HIGH RISK OF ILLNESS AND INJURY ON THE JOB INCLUDING CONDITIONS SUCH AS INFECTIOUS DISEASE MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURY IN COVERT NINETEEN. WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIONS CURRENTLY EXISTING CALIFORNIA FOR FIRST RESPONDERS IN MALE DOMINATED PROFESSIONS INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT FIRE. ALL NURSES AND HEALTH CARE WORKERS OVERWHELMINGLY WOMEN ACT THE SAME PROTECTIONS. SB TWO THIRTEEN SIMPLY EXTENDS SIMILAR WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIONS TO NURSES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND IN DOING SO THIS BILL SEEKS TO MODERNIZE OUTDATED LAWS. AND ACHIEVE GREATER GENDER EQUITY IN OUR STATE. FOR THIS REASON WE SECURE THE SUPPORT THE CALL OF THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY WOMEN'S CAUCUS NANCY FOWLER. AND THE CHAIR PLANS TO BRING THIS FORWARD TO THE FULL PARTY FORWARD FOR AN INDOOR SMOKE BUT JUST A FEW WEEKS. WE'VE ALSO SECURED THE SUPPORT OF THE COUNTY SANTA CLARA HOME TO THE SECOND LARGEST PUBLIC HEALTH. SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. AND COMPILED EVEN MORE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH TO JUSTIFY EACH SPECIFIC PRESUMPTION INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. I WILL NOTE THAT THIS RESEARCH BEEN SHARED WITH EACH OF YOUR OFFICES. LET ME PAUSE AND SAY THAT I HAVE AS MANY OF YOU KNOW. SIR PREVIOUSLY FOR TWELVE YEARS ON THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHICH AS I SAID RUNS ONE OF THE LARGEST PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS IN THE UNITED STATES. MULTIPLE HOSPITALS MULTIPLE CLINICS THOUSANDS OF HOSPITAL WORKERS. IT'S ALSO A COUNTY THAT HAS A VERY ROBUST PRIVATE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. SO I'M ACUTELY AWARE OF EQUITY ISSUES THAT PERVADE OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. FAIRNESS ISSUES. FOR A VERY LONG TIME. I HAVE A BEEN ON TOP OF THOSE ISSUES AND I'VE ACTED TO DRESS THEM IN MY LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAPACITY AND NOW HERE IN THE STATE SENATE. AND I'M COMMITTED TO BRINGING THESE EQUITY ISSUES FORWARD. HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD. CAN FINALLY CLOSE GENDER GAPS THAT PERVADE OUR CURRENT SYSTEM. I WANT TO GET JUST A BIT DEEPER INTO WHAT TYPE OF EQUITY ISSUES EXIST AND WHY. EXISTING LAW ONLY PROVIDES CERTAIN TYPES OF FRONT LINE PROFESSIONALS. ELIGIBILITY FOR WORKER'S COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIONS. THIS INCLUDES EMTS PARAMEDICS FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS ALL OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY MALE DOMINATED FIELDS DEPARTMENT OF LABOR SEVEN OUT OF EIGHT POLICE OFFICERS OR MEN NINETEEN OUT OF TWENTY FIREFIGHTERS ARE MEN AND THREE OUT OF FOUR EMTS. ARE MEN. MEANWHILE FRONTLINE WORKERS WHO WORK IN THE HEALTHCARE SETTING SUCH AS NURSES. THOSE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE PANDEMIC OVER THE LAST. COUPLE OF YEARS ARE NOT ENTITLED TO THE SAME WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIONS. NURSES HAVE ZERO. WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIONS. THIS IS DESPITE THE FACT THAT NURSES PROTECT THE SAME POPULATION IN OUR HOSPITALS. THE PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS PROTECT IN THE FIELD. NINE OUT OF TEN REGISTERED NURSES ARE WOMEN. ACCORDING TO THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS IN TWENTY TWENTY WORKPLACE HAZARDS THAT REQUIRED AT LEAST ONE DAY OFF OF WORK. TOTAL TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOR FIREFIGHTERS. TWO HUNDRED FOR POLICE OFFICERS THE TOOL FOR REGISTERED NURSE NURSES WITH SEVENTY EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY SIMPLE. SB TWO THIRTEEN RECOGNIZES AND ADDRESSES THE GLARING INEQUITY IN CALIFORNIA WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. THAT CORRECTS A HISTORICAL WRONG MADE DURING A VERY DIFFERENT TIME LONG AGO. EQUITY IS ONLY POSSIBLE WHEN ALL FRONT LINE PROFESSIONALS WHO FACE THE SAME RISK OF ILLNESS AND INJURY DUE TO THE NATURE OF THEIR WORK ARE GIVEN THE SAME GUARANTEE BENEFITS. HOW MANY MORE YEARS MUST PASS AND HOW MANY MORE EXCUSES ME WE MAKE BEFORE WE DO WHAT'S RIGHT. OPPONENTS MAY ARGUE THAT THE BILL ROUSSEL. IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FRAUDULENT CLAIM AND BANKRUPT HOSPITALS THIS IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT ALL PRESUMPTIONS IN THE BILL CAN BE REBUTTED. EMPLOYERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO DISPUTE ANY CLAIMS. SB TWO THIRTEEN EXPLICITLY PROTECTS IMPORTERS RIGHT TO DO SO. THIS BILLS RETURNING AFTER FOUR VOTE IN JUNE YOU MAY RECALL. INSENSIBLE DESPITE MY RELUCTANCE AGREED TO SCALE BACK THE SCOPE OF THE BILL TO ADDRESS COLLEAGUES. THIS BILL HAS BEEN AMENDED TO LIMIT THE CANCER PRESUMPTIONS TO SPECIFIC TYPES OF CANCERS. WITH NEXUS TO ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS TO ADD CO AUTHORS INTO REMOVED THE SUNSET ON THE CURRENT CODE NINETEEN PRESUMPTION. BUT WHICH WAS LEGISLATIVE PREVIOUSLY BY THIS LEGISLATURE TO SET TO EXPIRE. UP ALREADY THIS YEAR JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWO LET ME SAY RELUCTANT AS I MAY BE I APPRECIATE THE COOPERATION PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO HAVE COME FORWARD WITH SPECIFIC AMENDMENTS THAT DON'T WATER DOWN THE INTENT OF THE BILL. WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT AGAIN IS LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD. SB TWO THIRTEEN IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TOWARDS RESOLVING THE ECONOMIC AND GENDER INEQUITY THAT REMAINS IN OUR SOCIETY TO THIS DAY. ALL THREE THIS BILL. HAS BEEN A FURTHER I OPENING EXPERIENCE. AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS AS A COUNTY SUPERVISOR. I HAD A RECORD OF THE DRESS UP ADDRESSING FIRSTHAND IN CORRESPONDENCE IN BOATS AND VOTERS IN FACE TO FACE MEETINGS HOSPITALS UNDER CUTTING THE WORKFORCE. PUTTING PROFITS OVER PEOPLE IN THEIR WORKERS. SO AGAIN I MADE A PROMISE TO MYSELF TO DO THIS KIND OF WORK UPON ARRIVING HERE. IN THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME. THAT YOU HEAR ME COMING FROM A PLACE OF EQUITY AND FAIRNESS JUST LIKE SO MANY OF YOU HAVE AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. THE GAP IN ACCESS TO WORKERS COMPENSATION EXPERIENCE PER NURSES IS WRONG THAT MUST BE CORRECTED. LET ME JUST SAY. JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT. IN USED A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE ONE THAT ARE BROUGHT UP LAST JUNE. AGAIN AS I JUST STATED BASED ON LABOR STATISTICS. KEEP IN MIND FIREFIGHTERS 90% MEN NURSES 90% WOMEN. WHEN A FIREFIGHTER EMT ARRIVES AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM IN A HANDS OFF A PATIENT ON A GURNEY. IN ACQUIRES A HERNIA FROM LIFTING THE PATIENT HE- HE HAS A WORKERS COMP PRESUMPTION RIGHT NOW IN THAT MOMENT. WHEN HE HAS A PATIENT ON THE GURNEY OVER TO THE WOMAN NURSE. WOMAN NURSE AND SHE HURT HER BACK SHE HAS NO WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTION ST CONTINUE OF CARE. LITERALLY THE SAME ACUITY OF CARE SAME FRONTLINE STATUS IN THAT SPLIT SECOND. DURING THE HEAD OFF THE CAR PRESUMPTION DISAPPEARS. WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE. I ASK AGAIN WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE IF NOT GENDER THIS IS NOT ABOUT HOSPITALS VERSUS NURSES OR UNIONS VERSUS NOT PERSONS. VERSUS NON UNIONS IT'S ABOUT EQUITY. COLLEAGUES I DO NOT COME HERE TO STAND FOR THE STATUS QUO WHEN IT COMES TO EQUITY AND I DON'T THINK. MOST OF YOU IF ANY OF YOU ARE HERE FOR THAT EITHER. I THINK WE'RE HERE. TO ESTABLISH EQUITY ESPECIALLY IN AN AREA LIKE THIS WHAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS IN THIS STATE AND IN THIS COUNTRY. THAT WORK WOMEN DO IS EQUAL TO WORK THAT MEN DO AND THEY SHOULD BE COMPENSATED THAT WAY. WORKERS COMPENSATION SHOULD PULL THAT RULE. I ASK YOU TO STAND WITH ME TODAY FOR EQUITY FOR ALL FRONTLINE WORKERS. IN EQUITY FOR WOMEN AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER CORTESE MEMBERS IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE. SEEING AND HEARING NONE MADAM SECRETARY EXCUSE ME I'M SORRY CENTER BECKER. THANK YOU. I'M WHEN A FEW COMMENTS SEVENTY SEVEN GRATEFUL TO OUR WORKFORCE OF NURSES ESPECIALLY FOR THEIR HARD WORK DURING THEIR THIS PANDEMIC AND I DO SUPPORT A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS BILL- AS WITH AND I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT A FEW OF THE PRESUMPTIONS FROM IMPLEMENTATION STANDPOINT FROM SOME NURSES ARE SPOKEN TO INCLUSION OF CANCER ASTHMA COPD ARE. CHALLENGING AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE NEW DATA BEFORE WE AND TRY THESE PERMANENTLY.

ON I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE CHANGES THAT ARE MADE SUBSTANTIVELY ADDRESSED THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY MANY OF US WHO VOTED FOR IT- AND THOSE WHO. ARE WHO OPPOSED. AND WHO WANT TO SEE. OVER MORE OF A NEXUS BETWEEN. THE THE TYPES OF INJURIES- ARE IN THE WORKPLACE THAT THE FOLKS TO BE GIVING THIS GIVEN THIS REBUTTAL PRESUMPTION WOULD- WOULD WOULD WOULD WOULD OBTAIN NOW I'VE HAD SUBSTANTIAL CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHOR I APPRECIATE. THE HARD WORK THAT HE'S PUT IN TRYING TO TALK ME THROUGH A LOT OF THESE ISSUES. I KNOW THAT HE'S HIMSELF IS IN A DIFFICULT SPOT. I AND- YOU KNOW I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO GIVING HIM THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS IN A I HAVE UNFORTUNAELY OR FORTUNATELY YEAH I DON'T DISAGREE WITH OUR- OUR DEAN WHEN HE WHEN HE TALKS ABOUT THE BOTH THE UPSIDES AND DOWNSIDES OF. THE WAY WE DO OUR WORK AND THE FACT IT OFTENTIMES DEALS CAN'T GET STRUCK OVER HERE- FOR VARIOUS REASONS AND THEN YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE ASSEMBLY WORK THINGS OUT AND I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN THE AUTHOR AND IS GOOD FAITH- BUT I WILL POINT OUT- THAT. AND I'VE BEEN. NONPLUSSED BY THE- THE CHALLENGES OF GETTING ANY SUBJECT CHANGES MADE TO THIS BILL- BUT UP TO THIS POINT. I BUT I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE- THAT THE OFFICE GOT A LONG ROAD AHEAD ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE.

SENATE BILL THREE FORTY TWO BY SENATOR GONZALEZ AN ACT RELATING TO AIR POLLUTION SENATOR GONZALEZ THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS TODAY I RISE TO PRESENT SENATE BILL THREE FORTY TWO WHICH WILL IN MY OPINION UPLIFT THE VOICES OF THOSE MOVIES DECADES OF HISTORIC AND SYSTEMIC ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION. BY ADDING A REPRESENTATION TO THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT GOVERNING BOARD AS MANY- MEMBERS MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW THE CURRENT BOARD THAT IS COMPOSED OF FIFTEEN MEMBERS OVER TWO THIRDS WHICH ARE TEN ELECTED MEMBERS. AND THREE THAT OUR STATE APPOINTED MEMBERS ONE BY THE GOVERNOR WHEN BY THE SPEAKER IN OUR PRO TEM. DESPITE SIGNIFICANT QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE LAST DECADE THE SOUTH COAST AIR BASIN HAS SOME HAS HAD SOME OF THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE NATION IT'S NOT A HARD TO FIND REPORTS LIKE IN THE L. A. TIMES AND CAL MATTERS AND SUCH THAT HAVE SAID ON A DAILY BASIS. THERE ARE RESIDENTS THAT ARE DEALING WITH SOME OF THE WORST IN THE WHOLE NATION IN FACT OVER TWENTY TIMES TONS MORE- ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF OUR PORTS CONGESTION. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES HAVE HISTORICALLY OPEN OVER BURDENED WITH THE IMPACTS OF AIR POLLUTION AND CONTAMINATION AND SADLY THESE COMMUNITIES ARE IN MY DISTRICT OF SOUTHEAST LOS ANGELES ALONG THE I SEVENTY CORRIDOR WEST LONG BEACH AS WELL AS PLACES LIKE WILMINGTON AND IN THE INLAND EMPIRE. THEY'VE BEEN PLAGUED BY POLLUTION FROM REFINERIES METAL AND MEAT PROCESSING PLANTS AND BAD ACTOR BUSINESSES AND THEIR. FIRST FORCED TO PAY THE HIGHEST COST. APPOINTING TO THE A DEEP THAT. AND WORK DIRECTLY WITH COMMUNITY THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY BURDENED BY HIGH LEVELS OF POLLUTION WILL BRING VALUABLE EXPERTISE. AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING MY OFFICE HAS BEEN WORKING IN GOOD FAITH WITH SOMEBODY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE LABOR COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVOCATES A YEAR TO INSURE THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT. NOW ALTHOUGH THIS IS NOT PERFECT AND WE STILL HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO. WE ARE WORKING AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN GOOD FAITH SHOULD THIS BILL MOVED OFF THE FLOOR TODAY. IN FACT- WHEN I BROUGHT THIS BILL UP IN MARCH WE WORKED ON IT DIDN'T HAVE ANY OPPOSITION UNTIL SIX MONTHS LATER AND AT THE SIX MONTH MARK WE DID RECEIVE A LOT OF OPPOSITION FROM OUR- OUR FRIENDS IN LABOR. AND WHAT WE HAD WORKED ON WAS A FEW DIFFERENT SCENARIOS WHETHER IT WAS A LABOR REPRESENTATIVE. OR SUCH THAT WE CAN TALK ABOUT WE ARE STILL. DEBATING THOSE ITEMS NOW. BUT I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THAT AFTER THIS YEAR. WE CANNOT DELAY THIS PROGRESS ANY LONGER. WE HAVE TO ACT NOW. AND IN FACT SB THREE FORTY TWO WAS ACTUALLY TESTED POLICY IDEA. IT HAS BEEN BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE BEFORE. MANY TIMES. IN FACT IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN JUST THREE YEARS AGO THE SAN DIEGO AIR POLLUTION BOARD VIA. AB FOUR TWENTY THREE. ALSO ADDED. AN ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVOCATE. THE PERSON THAT. HAS A PUBLIC HEALTH BACKGROUND AND SOMEONE WITH A SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND. TO KNOW WITH NO OPPOSITION IN FACT I BELIEVE IT HAD. MINOR LABOR- SUPPORT. AND SO I KNOW THAT THIS IS. AN IMPORTANT VERY IMPORTANT DISCUSSION TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DEBATE. BUT I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT WORK- AGAIN I AM THE CHILD OF A- TEAMSTER THE CHILD OF. SOMEBODY THAT UNDERSTANDS- WHAT IT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE EVERY SINGLE DAY WITH- SOMEBODY THAT. IS IN THE LABOR COMMUNITY. BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO SO MEMBERS WE CANNOT DELAY THIS ANY LONGER I'M LOOKING TO LEVEL UP THE DISCUSSIONS I LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING THIS WITH- OUR LABOR PARTNERS AS WELL AS OUR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ADVOCATES. AND AGAIN. LOOKING FORWARD TO. THE DISCUSSION BUT- WHAT'S ON THE TABLE HERE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER SOMEONE WITH A SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND- WE CAN CERTAINLY GET THROUGH THIS FOR OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN ALL FOUR COUNTIES. SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NAY VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ MEMBERS ANY DISCUSSION AND OR DEBATE. DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR CALM WATER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I AM A- JOINT CO AUTHOR ON THIS BILL- IN SO. I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS- I YOU KNOW FOR FOLKS WHO MIGHT NOT KNOW WE'VE BEEN HAVING A SERIES OF. CLIMATE DISCUSSIONS WITH- A SMALL GROUP OF REALLY COMMITTED SENATORS AND WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH FOLKS ALL ACROSS THE SPECTRUM AS IT RELATES TO ENVIRONMENTALISM. AND HOW THE STATE TACKLES IT. AND I THINK THE BEAUTY OF THESE DISCUSSIONS IS THAT WE FIND WAYS. TO CREATE A SPACE AT THE TABLE FOR EVERYONE RECOGNIZING THAT NOT EVERYONE AGREES. ON EVERY JOURNEY THAT WE SHOULD BE TAKING BUT EVERYONE CERTAINLY AGREES THAT WE HAVE TO GET TO THE DESTINATION IN THE DESTINATION IS. YOU KNOW HOW DO WE- ATTACKED OUR CLIMATE HOW DO WE PROTECT JOBS HOW DO WE INFUSE INVESTMENT IN A WAY THAT IS EQUITABLE ACROSS ALL PARTS OF THIS STATE. AND SO I'M REALLY TAKING THAT CHARGE TO HEART YOU KNOW AS I'M LOOKING AT ALL OF THESE BILLS. I KNOW THAT THERE IS A LONG ROAD AHEAD FOR SB THREE FOUR TWO. AND I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH IN THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL THAT SHE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THE WORK TO TALK WITH OPPOSITION. TO FIND A PATH FORWARD I AM ALSO OF THE MINDSET THAT. IF FOLKS DON'T HAVE A PLACE AT THE TABLE. THEY WILL FIND A WAY TO GET TO THE TABLE. IN WAYS THAT MIGHT NOT BE COMFORTABLE. AND SO HOW DO WE WORK AS DILIGENTLY AND AUTHENTICALLY AS POSSIBLE TO CREATE THAT SPACE BECAUSE EVERYONE IS WORKINGREALLY HARD TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES AROUND. NO CLIMATE PROTECTION. GREEN ENERGY CLEAN ENERGY AND CLEAN ECONOMY AND EQUITABLE INVESTMENTS IN ALL OF THIS SPACE- SO I RESPECT WHAT THE- SENATOR FROM LONG BEACH HAS BEEN DOING ON THIS AND I KNOW THAT SHE WILL GET TO THE FINISH LINE AND I'M JUST IMPLORING THAT WE ALL LEAN IN AND SUPPORT THE AUTHOR- IN THIS WORK BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT. I'M AND HAVING THE SEATS AT THE TABLE WHERE EVERYONE FEELS LIKE THEY HAVE A VOICE- IS IMPORTANT AN OPENING THOSE SPACES FOR FOLKS WHO HAVE FELT LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN DISENFRANCHISED OR KEPT FROM IT IS I THINK WHAT MOST OF US ARE TRYING TO DO IN THIS WORK AROUND EQUITY SO I AM URGING AND I VOTE ON THREE FOUR TWO AND I'M JUST URGING CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION. TO FIGURE OUT A PATHWAY FORWARD- BECAUSE IT WILL TAKE ALL OF US IT WILL TAKE ALL OF US. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT. AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE IMPORTANT ISSUES THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER CALM WATER SENATOR. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- JUST TAKING OFF OF WHAT. THE SENATOR JUST MENTIONED IT DOES TAKE ALL OF US AND I KNOW THAT ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE WILL HAVE A DISAGREEMENT ON THIS. ON THIS BILL BUT I KNOW STAKEHOLDERS WANT TO END UP IN THE SAME PLACE WANT TO END UP WHERE WE HAVE GOOD JOBS BECAUSE NOTHING IS WORSE FOR A COMMUNITY. THAT THE HAVE CRAPPY JOBS WHERE YOU HAVE THE WORKING POOR- I KNOW THAT'S WHAT. OUR LABOR STANDS FOR I ALSO KNOW THAT THOSE SAME COMMUNITIES THAT GET CRAPPY JOBS AND THEY ARE THE WORKING POOR ARE THE SAME ONES WHO GET. OF YOU KNOW THE AIR CONTAMINATION THE WATER THE SOIL. OUT WE JUST CAN'T KEEP GOING OUT THIS WITH EACH OTHER- SOUL I AM VERY HOPEFUL THAT. OF THE SENATOR FROM LONG BEACH WHAT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK REALLY HARD TO GET AT A PLACE WHERE WE CAN ALL SUPPORT EACH OTHER THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR RUSSELL. MEMBERS OTHER DISCUSSIONS CENTER PAM. OKAY THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I JUST WANT TO FIRST OF ALL I RECOGNIZE- FACT THAT THIS IS A BILL THAT AFFECTS THE IT SENATORS DISTRICT- AND ALSO- UNDERSTAND THAT- APPRECIATE HER COMMITMENT TO- SEEK AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL THAT WOULD THEN FOCUS ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH ASPECTS TO HAVE- ONE MEMBERS BE A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER. AND THE OTHER TO BE AND SCIENTISTS WITH EXPERTISE IN AIR QUALITY- SIMILAR TO WHAT SHE POINTED OUT SAN DIEGO A LEGISLATION THAT THAT PASSED THE LEGISLATURE WITHOUT TO ACTUALLY ON THE SIGNATURE OPPOSITION AND THE TRYING TO DO SIMILAR THINGS TO ADDRESS THESE AIR QUALITY ISSUES IN HER DISTRICT AND TO ME THOSE ARE SEEM TO BE REASONABLE- GOALS- TO PURSUE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND- EXPECT AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE HER COMMITMENT AND LOOK FORWARD TO. FOR MAKING THIS CHANGES IN THE ASSEMBLY THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER PAM CENTER WINNER. I THANK YOU MATTER PRESIDENT I RISING SUPPORT. OF SB THREE FORTY TWO I HAVE TO SAY WE IT IS- IT MAKES ME SAD THAT WE HAVE IS CONTINUING. COMPLEX BETWEEN. THESE TWO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT HOLES OF SUPPORTING WORKING PEOPLE AND GREAT JOBS SUPPORTING LABOR WHICH SO MANY OF US DO- AND RECOGNIZING. NOT JUST THE EXISTENTIAL FOR THE CLIMATE CHANGE POSES THE CLIMATE CHANGE IS OFTEN IT'S VERY NEBULOUS FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THIS SORT OF. THING- OVER ARCHES EVERYTHING- SUCH JUST ABOUT CLIMATE ACTION IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE. THAT PEOPLE AND CHILDREN HAVE CLEAN AIR THEY CAN BREED IN ERROR THAT DOES NOT MAKE THEM IS SET. DIRECTLY NOT INDIRECT NEBULOUS. IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE BUT LITERALLY BREATHING AIR AND. THAT AIR MAKES YOU SICK TRAGICALLY NOT SURPRISING- BUT ALWAYS BEARS REPEATING THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THIRTY. UNHEALTHY DANGEROUS AIR NOT ALL COMMUNITIES ARE AFFECTED THE SAME WAY. AND WE KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM COMMUNITIES OF COLOR PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WERE SEEN AS INCREASED RATES OF ASTHMA CANCER AND OTHER DISEASES BECAUSE OF THE DIRTY CONTAMINATED DANGEROUS ERA AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT WE CHARGE AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT'S WITH TRYING TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AND I THINK- BRINGING THIS. ADDITIONAL VOICE I TO THE TABLE AND A VERY FORMAL WAY MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN THE WORLD ON SUPPORTING THIS- I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR WILL CONTINUE HAVING DIALOGUE- AND I KNOW THAT WE CAN WE WILL EVENTUALLY GET THERE I MEAN KNOWLEDGE MEN AND THE UNION. OF THESE TWO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT GOALS OF SUPPORTING WORKING PEOPLE CREATING HIGH PAYING JOBS AND PRESERVING HIGH PAYING JOBS. AND NOT POISONING OUR CHILDREN. THANK YOU CENTER WIENER SENATOR LAMONT. THANK YOU MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND I ALSO RISE A SOMEONE WHO WAS THERE WHO SUPPORTED WHEN WE DID THIS FOR SAN DIEGO FOR CARBON FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY- IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THIS PARTICULAR BILL.

TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH. EXPERTS AT THE TABLE AND THIS BILL ALLOWS US TO DO THIS FOR AIR QUALITY- IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT WE RE IN A PLACE FOR THIS BILL HAS OPPOSITION- BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE CONSISTENT IN CALIFORNIA AND SAY WE'VE DONE THIS FOR OTHER COMMUNITIES- ARE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY DESERVES. WHY ARE STATE HAS WHAT'S THAT HAKIM VALLEY HAS A WHAT SAN DIEGO HAS- AND WE DESERVE. TO DO SO IN A TRANSPARENT AND CONSISTENT WAY LIKE WE HAVE ON MULTIPLE ISSUES IN THE STATE- I DO HOPE THAT AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD WE CAN FIND A WAY TO CONTINUE- THE CONVERSATIONS WITH OPPOSITION BUT ALSO. I KNOW THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO FOR THIS COMMUNITY WHAT THIS BODY HAS DONE FOR OTHER COMMUNITIES. SO WITH THAT I HOPE WHAT WE CAN PASS THIS BILL. THANK YOU CENTER LIMÓN. CENTER ROTH.
