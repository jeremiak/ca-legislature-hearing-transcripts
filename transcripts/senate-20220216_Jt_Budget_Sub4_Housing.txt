AND WE ARE GOING TO HOLD QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. UNTIL AFTER THE ENTIRE PANEL HAS SPOKEN. SO L. A. O. R. I SEE YOU I THINK ARE YOU READY TO BEGIN. GOOD MORNING SENATORS AND WITH THIS MORALES WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. IF YOU JUST BEAR WITH ME FOR ONE MOMENT WHILE I BEGAN SHARING MY SCREEN BERMAN PRESENTATION. I HOPE YOU CAN SORT OF SEE THAT HAND OUT CLEARLY IT'S ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE ALEJO'S WEBSITE AND EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE COPIES ON THEIR DESK AS WELL. YOU'RE GOOD. YEAH COMMITTEE STAFF TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF MAJOR STATE SPENDING ACTIONS IN RECENT YEARS RELATED TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. WHAT CAN PROVIDE A BIT OF CONTACT FOR SOME OF THE ON MANY WEEKS IN RECENT YEARS. HOUSING AFFORDABILITY THE FEAR AND WHY CHALLENGES THE STATE AND CALIFORNIANS A LARGER SHARE OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT AND HOUSEHOLD IN THE REST OF THE NATION OVER ONE POINT FIVE MILLION LOW INCOME RENTERS FACE DIRE COST PRESSURES AND THE MORE THAN HALF OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING. HOMES IN THE STATE COST ABOUT TWO POINT THREE TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AND RENTS ARE ABOUT 50% HIGHER IN THE STATE AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WHILE MANY FACTORS HAVE A ROLE IN TRAINING CALIFORNIA'S HIGH HOUSING COSTS THE MOST IMPORTANT IS A SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGE OF HOUSING. PARTICULARLY IN URBAN CULTURE COMMUNITIES. THIS COMPETITION FOR HOUSING INCREASES- ON HOME PRICES AND RENTS IN THESE COASTAL URBAN COMMUNITIES. AND PUSHES SOME PEOPLE TO INLAND AREAS OF THE STATE WHICH THEN REDUCES PRICES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AS WELL. WELL WE KNOW THAT HOMELESS IS A- PROBLEM WITH MANY CAUSES THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING IS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN THE STATE'S HOMELESSNESS CRISIS. FOR THE STATE'S LOWEST INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WE SPEND A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING A JOB LOSS OR UNEXPECTED EXPENSE COULD LEAD THEM TO HOUSING INSTABILITY OR HOMELESSNESS. MORE PEOPLE EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA THAN ANY OTHER STATE. YOU SEE SOME DATA POINTS THERE FROM TWENTY TWENTY UNSCOM WITH THIS COUNT THE MOST RECENT YOUR WE HAVE COMPLETE FEDERAL DATA IN THAT POINT IN TIME THERE WAS ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE THOUSAND. FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ABOUT 70% OF THOSE PEOPLE WERE UNSHELTERED. AND WHILE. ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY KINDA ME NOW DOT ON AND PEOPLE NEXT HOMELESSNESS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. A WE DO HAVE SOME DATA THAT FIFTY ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED PEOPLE WERE IN SHELTERS IN NEXT YEAR. THE RECENT INCREASES IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE ARE DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS. THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS HAS BECOME MORE ACUTE IN RECENT YEARS THE STATE HAS TAKEN A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN FUNDING AND SUPPORTING LOCAL GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS. OVERALL THE STATE HAS INCREASED ITS ROLE BY ADDRESSING ON THE PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT ALL THOSE ARE ONE TIME IN TEMPORARY FUNDING TOWARDS INFRASTRUCTURE AND FLEXIBLE AID TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN RECENT YEARS. SIMILARLY AS A HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS HAS BECOME MORE ACUTE OVER TIME THE STATE HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED ITS FISCAL ROLE BY EXPANDING- EXPANDING EXISTING PROGRAMS AS WELL AS ESTABLISHING SOME NEW PROGRAM TO HELP SUBSIDIZE THE COST OF HOUSING. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ONCE AGAIN USING YOUR- CONTEMPORARY RESOURCES. THIS TABLE WHICH ON THAT PAGE OF THE HAND. I'M NEED TO K. THEM DISK. SPENDING ACTIONS WITH THE STATE AND TO SEE THAT OUR PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR OVERSEEING HOUSING HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS SO THE HOUSING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT CALIFORNIA INJURY INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS THE CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE. AND THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY THE TABLE DOES NOT CAPTURE OTHER SPENDING ACTIONS RELATED TO HEALTHY HOMELESSNESS IN DEPARTMENTS THAT HAVE OTHER PRIMARY MISSIONS FOR EXAMPLE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT. THE TABLE BEGAN IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND NINETEEN FISCAL YEAR WHEN THE STATE BEGAN PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TOWARDS HOMELESSNESS. THROUGH THE HEAP PROGRAM. THE MOST RECENT FISCAL YEAR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO AM AUTHORIZED SOME SPENDING ACTIONS IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AND SO YOU SEE IN THOSE REFLECTED ON THE TABLE HOWEVER THE GOVERNOR IS ALSO PER PROPOSED ADDITIONAL SPENDING IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE- SINCE THE LARGEST. TAKEN ACTION ON THIS PROPOSAL THEY ARE NOT REFLECTED ON THIS YEAR. SO YOU SEE SORT OF IN. IN THESE. ON THEIR OFFICER OTHERS THE STATE HAS. A LOT THIRTEEN FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ACROSS THE LAST SEVERAL SCHOOL YEARS TOWARDS HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS. FINAL HE TAKEAWAYS FROM THE TABLE- FIRST OPENING THE STATE'S RECENT ACT ON HOUSING AND HOMELESS HAVE BEEN AND SPREAD ACROSS MULTIPLE AND WHILE THE REFLECTED ON THE TABLE IMAGINE ARE THEY STILL DO NOT ALL OF THIS TO SPENDING TO HOW AND HOME. MUCH OF THE NEW SPENDING BEEN ONE TIME OR TEMPORARY EVEN IN MANY THE CASES WERE FUNDING BEEN PROVIDE IN MORE. FISCAL YEARS THE HAS OFTEN BEEN PER. WITH ON A ONE. OR TEMPER BASIS. THE SIX EIGHT BILLION IN NEW FUNDING PROVIDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR WAS LARGELY SUPPORTED BY FEDERAL FUNDS. SPECIFICALLY FEDERAL AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACTS- THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A PANDEMIC. AND ONCE AGAIN THE- FOR THE HOUSING BEEN ON EXPANDING EXISTING AND ESTABLISHING NEW PROGRAMS THAT HELP SUBSIDIZE THE COST OF HOUSING WELL FOR HOMELESSNESS STATE BECAUSE LARGELY BEEN ON INCREASING INFRASTRUCTURE AND PROVIDING. AID TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. INTO THE STUFF CONCLUDE MY PREPARED PRESENTATION I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE WHEN APPROPRIATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO NEXT WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE CALIFORNIA INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS. AND ARE YOU WITH US. THE NEW ALL RIGHT WELL HEADED SISTER.

WAS PROVIDED FUNDING TO LAUNCH THE LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT TO TAKE A LOOK AT STATE FUNDING FROM RECENT BUDGET YEARS STARTING WITH THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YEAR AND ENDING WITH THE TWENTY ONE. TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. THE ASSESSMENT WILL PROVIDE THE STATE WITH A HOLISTIC UNDERSTANDING OF HOW STATE PROGRAMS INTERACT WITH DIFFERENT FUNDING AND SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEMS ACROSS THE STATE. WHICH WILL ENABLE US TO BETTER ASSESS HOW TO STRATEGICALLY DEPLOY THOSE RESOURCES. AND TO GAIN A MORE REFINED UNDERSTANDING OF SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTION TYPES AND STRATEGIES. OUR ONGOING EFFORTS IN ENHANCING THE STATE'S DATA COLLECTION AND PLANNING INFRASTRUCTURE HAVE BEEN A CRITICAL PIECE OF INFORMING OUR BUDGET INVESTMENTS. SINCE TWENTY EIGHTEEN CALYCES HAS ADMINISTERED OVER THREE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND FLEXIBLE LOCAL FUNDING. WITH EACH INVESTMENT THE STATE'S CONTINUUM OF CARE LARGE CITIES AND COUNTIES COMPRISING OF A TOTAL OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN ELIGIBLE JURISDICTIONS HAVE HAD ACCESS TO LOCAL FUNDING TO PROVIDE RESOURCES THAT CAN MEET THE DIVERSE NEEDS. OF COMMUNITIES ACROSS OUR STATE. THIS APPROACH TO HAVE SHARED DECISION MAKING AROUND THE LOCAL USES A FUNDING COMPLEMENT LONGER TERM CAPITAL INVESTMENTS SUCH AS HOME KEEP THAT FOCUS ON THAT. ON EXPANDING AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING. IN THE LAST YEAR THE CALORIES EACH GRANT SCHEME HAS HAD SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF OUR GRANT PROGRAMS. THE STATE'S FIRST ITERATION OF FLEXIBLE BLOCK GRANT FUNDING AND IT LAST SUMMER. THE HOMELESS EMERGENCY AID PROGRAM OR HE PROVIDED FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN BLOCK GRANTS TO ASSIST LOCALITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA PROVIDING FLEXIBLE FUNDS TO ASSIST IN THEIR HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE.

THE COUNCIL IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CONTINUOUSLY REFINE THE PROGRAM'S APPROACH BY FOCUSING ON EFFORTS SUCH AS PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL COORDINATION. DEVELOPING LOCAL CAPACITY AND ENSURING LOCAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND OUTCOMES. SPECIFICALLY AS PART OF THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET INVESTMENT AND HAPPY GRANTEES ARE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP ROBUST LOCAL ACTION PLANS OUTLINING LOCAL NEEDS RESOURCES PERFORMANCE GOALS AND STRATEGIES TO MEET THOSE GOALS.

THANK YOU EVERYONE- MY NAME'S ZACH OLMSTEAD I'M THE CHIEF DEPUTY AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT NUMBER HALF OUR TEAM I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH YOU TODAY AND SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT HOUSING HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS FROM PREVIOUS BUDGET INVESTMENTS. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WITH SUPPORT LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR AND STAKEHOLDERS AROUND THE STATE WE WORK TOGETHER. ON SEVERAL FRONTS TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND BLOOD SOME OF THE WORST IMPACTS THE HOUSING CRISIS THE TARGET TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PLANNING GRANTS HOUSING INVESTMENTS AND ACCOUNTABILITY EFFORTS. THROUGHOUT THE PAST YEARS WE'VE DEEPENED OUR PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATION WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS TO ALIGN EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HOUSING NEEDS. THIS COLLABORATION IS EVIDENT A CD AND I WORK WITH COLLEGE AVE THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS THE PART OF GENERAL SERVICES AND IN MANY OTHERS. THESE RELATIONSHIPS IN OUR WORK AT WITH FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL PARTNERS WE COLLABORATE TO ME OUR MISSION. AND SHE BETTER OUTCOMES TOGETHER. ALTOGETHER WE IMPLEMENTED BEST TO HELP WITH THE SPEC OF HOUSE NEED AND RESPONSE ANGER. OF HOMES. IBM THIS MEETING LATE LAST WEEK OUR TEAM WITH THE COMMITTEE CAN A OF DOC TO PROVIDE DETAILED. ABOUT OUR PROGRAM. OF WESTERN- AS WE GET TO MEMBER WE MAYOR WAS TO. BUT BEFORE THEN I EXCITED TO PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF- FOR PROGRAMS IN INTEREST OF TIME THAT SHOWCASE OPPORTUNITIES- AND IMPORTANT OUTCOMES IN OUR PARTNERSHIPS TO HELP ACHIEVE THESE RESULTS. THE COMMITTEE IS A FAMILIAR I'M SURE WITH HUNKY BUT I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE SIGNIFICANT INFUSION OF HOUSING THAT THE PROGRAM HAS BROUGHT ONLINE. TO HELP CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN VERY SHORT TIME FRAMES THE FIRST INFUSIONS OF HOME HE FACILITATED THE CREATION OF NEARLY SIX THOUSAND UNITS OKAY INTERMENT PERMANENT HOUSING. AND HUNDRED TWENTY DIFFERENT SITES IN THIRTY FIVE DIFFERENT COUNTIES WITH EVERY PROJECT. RECEIVING OPERATING SUPPORT AS WELL. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS BEEN VERY PARTNERS AND WE ARE EXCITED AS THEY CONTINUE TO STEP UP WITH APPLICATIONS FOR HOKEY TO POINT OUT WHAT WE WANT SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. IN OVER THE COUNTER FASHION SECOND OKIE IS AVAILABLE ON EACH YEAR WEBSITE AND REFLECTS THE FOURTEEN AWARDS WE HAVE ALREADY ANNOUNCED. FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION IN FUNDING WHICH ARE CREATING TWELVE HUNDRED UNITS. AND A RECENT MILESTONE OF A JANUARY THIRTY FIRST DEADLINE TO APPLY FOR THE GEOGRAPHIC SET ASIDE TO FUNDS HAS JUST PASSED. AND WHILE WE'RE STILL ABOUT IT IS THAT AGENCY I AM PLEASED TO REPORT IN TOTAL OVER TWO BILLION HAS ALREADY BEEN REQUESTED FOR THE ONE POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION AVAILABLE. FROM THIS YEAR'S NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY. SO THE STORE. INTEREST HOTELS AND MOTELS CONTINUE TO BE ONE POSSIBLE PRODUCT TYPE BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT WE OUGHT ARCING CONTINUED INTEREST IN MODULAR HOUSING. ACQUISITION OF EXISTING MULTI FAMILY HOUSING AND OTHER ADAPTER USES THAT ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE. ANOTHER PROGRAM I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THE IN PHILLIP INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM WHICH HELPS FOCUS ON PLACE BASED SOLUTIONS TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO INFILL HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. CALIFORNIA VOTERS AND THE LEGISLATURE HAVE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. WHICH HAS THE LAST TWO FUNDING ROUNDS AWARDED A LITTLE OVER FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION TO NINETY SIX DIFFERENT PROJECTS. TWENTY ONE OF THOSE TO SMALL JURISDICTIONS. THESE AWARDS ARE STILL TAKING PRODUCTION OF IN THOSE. AREAS AND THE CO BENEFIT OF THESE INVESTMENTS AS A REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WHICH IS WHY I HIGH KEY IS INCLUDING GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S PROPOSED BUDGET. AS PART OF THE STATE'S COORDINATED RESPONSE THE CLIMATE CRISIS. CALIFORNIA HOUSING STELLARATOR IS ANOTHER NEW INVESTMENT ALLOCATED MR AJIT. THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS EACH THE TO FIND CHAU READY. THAT HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO BEGIN CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE OF THE SHORTAGE OF FEDERAL TAX CREDITS IN BONDS. EARLIER THIS MONTH NINE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE MILLION IN AWARDS FOR TWENTY SEVEN FOR THE HOUSING PROJECTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WERE ANNOUNCED WITH NEARLY ALL OF THE PROJECTS EXPECTED TO BREAK GROUND BY THIS SUMMER. WITH FULLY COMPLETED. THE PROJECT WILL CREATE TWENTY THREE HUNDRED HOUSING UNITS FIVE HUNDRED OF WHICH ARE FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. NOTHING SORRY PRIORITIZE PROJECTS FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND FOR THOSE BELOW THIRTY PERCENT. WE CAN AND CAPS CALIFORNIA HOUSING STELLARATOR WILL BE A COMPETITIVE PROCESS FOR PREVIOUSLY ECT AWARDED ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE ALL WOULD ALSO BE SEEKING 4% TAX CREDITS. GRAHAM WILL INCLUDE REGIONAL ALLOCATIONS TO ENSURE PROJECT GRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF THESE FUNDS. AND FOR THE NEXT PHASE. OF THE PROJECT FOR THE SONGWRITER AN ADDITIONAL SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE AND I'LL COME OUT LATER THIS MONTH. WELL NOT A PRODUCTION PROGRAM- WE THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT HIGHLIGHT SOME OTHER SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS MADE IN EACH AND EVERY CITY AND COUNTY THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN THE FORMER SEVERAL ROUNDS OF PLANNING GRANTS. THAT HELP BUILD CAPACITY OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN PREPARATION FOR SIX HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE. SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN. SB TWO PLANNING GRANTS AND WHAT WE CALL OUR LEAD EASIEST RIGHT ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP JURISDICTIONS RESULT AND GET READY FOR HOUSING ELEMENT REQUIREMENTS. FOR THESE GRANTS THERE WAS NO PREVIOUS FUNDING TO JURISDICTIONS TO ASSIST THEM WITH HOUSING L. OPERATIONS. WE APPRECIATE THIS OPPORTUNITY PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OF PLANNING GRANTS FOR TO CITIES AND COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IT'S GOING TO ALSO BE COMBINED WITH THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE- PERSONALIZE REGIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PLANTED OFFICE HOURS. AGENCIES BUILDING BLOCKS GUIDE TO CREATE A HOUSING ELEMENT. MEMOS EXPLAINING HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW HOUSING ELEMENT LAWS AND CONTINUALLY GROWING HOUSING HUB WITH TEMPLATES AND TOOLKITS COVERING THE MOST REQUESTED TOPICS. WITH THREE TWO POINT OH FUNDING IN THIS BUDGET YEAR IS SHE WILL BE ABLE TO PUT OUT AN ADDITIONAL SIX HUNDRED MILLION IN PLANNING INFORMATION GRANT. IMITATION GRANT EXCUSE ME.

OKAY IN THE WORKS IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING YES- INDEED YEAH SO CAN YOU ALSO SPEAK TO SOME OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT LOCALS ARE USING FOR TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH THAT IS A HUGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR HOMELESSNESS POPULATION. YES AND LET'S NOT EVEN DON'T TURN TO VICTOR DERON WILL BUILD THE SPEAK. I'M MORE DEEPLY ABOUT THAT ISSUE. VICTOR YOUNG THEY ARE. GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE SO GOOD TO BE HERE- SO. WE'VE SLOWLY BEEN RAMPING UP SOME OF THEIR REQUIRED INVESTMENTS FOR TRANSITION AGE YEARS BEGINNING WITH HE- WAS THE FIRST A LARGE FLEXIBLE BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM THAT REQUIRED ALL OF OUR GRAND CHIEFS TO SET ASIDE A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR SERVICES FOR YOUTH I WANT TO MAKE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN SERVICES THAT. INCIDENTALLY SERVE YOU AND SERVICES THAT ARE DESIGNED TO BE DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE FOR USE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND AS THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE CONTINUED WE HAVE SLOWLY INCREASED AT THE REQUIRE SET ASIDE- STARTING WITH NOW TO TEN PERCENT. WITH THE HALF THREE IN A HALF FOR. THAT WERE ALSO TO- THAT IN HE WHICH WAS LOW MENTION BE FORTHCOMING NEXT MONTH- WE SEE REFLECTED SOME REALLY INNOVATIVE WORK AROUND SERVICES FOR YOUTH AND OF THAT OUR GRANTEES EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM SET ASIDE TRANSACTION SERVICE. OKAY THANK YOU. I'M THIS QUESTION IS FOR H. S. CD THE ARM HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. YOU TALKED A LOT ABOUT THESE COORDINATING EFFORTS BETWEEN H. C. D. N. T. C. A. C. IN OTHER STATE HOUSING PROGRAMS LOTS OF ACRONYMS. CAN YOU SHARE SOME OF THE LESSONS LEARNED- BECAUSE- I THINK WE WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE STATE CAN FILL A GAP AND WE'RE STATE WHERE THE STATE CAN BRIDGE THE GAP. AND COORDINATION SEEMS TO BE. A BIG ISSUE- I'M FOR THE STATE AND IT'S ALL OF THESE MUNICIPALITIES NEW FOR EACH CD MOST OF WHERE THAT OCCURS IS THROUGH OUR- PROGRAMS THAT WE THAT WE OPERATE THAT ARE REALLY A PRODUCTION FOCUS SO YOU MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH THE VETERANS HOUSING HOMELESS PREVENTION. PROGRAM FUNDED THROUGH- BY VOTER APPROVED BONDS RIGHT WE BELONG COLLABORATIVELY CALUMET ON THAT FOR EXAMPLE SO WELL WE HAVE THE EXPERTISE FOR EXAMPLE ON THE- HOUSING COMPONENTS OR THE REAL ESTATE COMPONENT APPLICATION THERE AND- CAL THAT IS EVALUATING THOSE SERVICE THE SERVICE PLANS- IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS PLAN YOU KNOW WITH THOSE PROPOSALS. AND OUT TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE FOCUSED AND RIGHT AND APPROPRIATE FOR VETERANS POPULATION THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM IS A COLLABORATION ST GROWTH COUNCIL- SO WE AGAIN ACTUALLY ADMINISTERS THAT PROGRAM BEHALF OF THE COUNCIL BUT THE COUNCIL THEIR COURSE DELIBERATING ON ON HOW THAT PROGRAM IS ADEQUATELY ADDRESSING. A ST STE CALDERON CLAIM IT AS WELL. SO DOES IT OF COURSE BEEN PROGRAMS THERE'S A EXAM. AMONG MANY- IN TERMS OF WHERE WE COME SO- ONE LET AND THEN THE THERE'S A NEW. OF MAYBE THIS IS THE POINT OF MAKE INTO OF A LESSON LEARNED- WHERE WE ARE DEPLOYING ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU TALK WE WANT ONE SPEAKS TO FEDERAL FUNDS WERE DEPLOYING THE FUNDS DOWN TO THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. THEY'RE OFTEN TO ARM ARGUMENT CONTINUES OF CARE NURSING HOMELESSNESS- AND I THINK WE HAVE TRIED TO COMBINE THOSE WITH ROBUST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THIS CONTAINS OF CARE AS I KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA I C. H. HAS- BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T REALLY. THIS IS AN OBSERVATION- WE HAVE REALLY DILUTES THOSE ENTITIES WITH QUITE A BIT OF FUNDING OR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS RIGHT IT TAKES TIME TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY- MANY OF THEM MAY BE UNDER RESOURCE FOR MANY YEARS AND JUST IN THE IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST FEW YEARS. I MEAN WE'RE PUTTING BILLIONS INTO THE SYSTEMS. AND I THINK- PART OF THE FRUSTRATION OF THE SLOAN IS THAT MANY OF US FEEL LIKE WE YOU KNOW WE'RE RESPONSIBLE TO THE TO THE FACTS FOR EXAMPLE ON ON HOW THOSE LOCALS IN TORRANCE AND LOS FINES- AND WE HAVE TO. DO I THINK THE OBSERVATION THERE RIGHT IS IT'S TAKEN THEM SOME TIME. IN A COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN AN ENVIRONMENT. WHERE IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT TO MAYBE ATTRACT. YOU KNOW. NOT PROP EMPLOYMENT AND ALL THE SORT OF- THEIR RAMP UP. AND I THINK THAT SOME TO KEEP IN MIND AS WE THINK ABOUT A LOT OF THESE RESOURCES THAT ARE FLOWING DOWN. LOCAL LEVELS- IT WAS VERY ENTITIES YOU KNOW ARE ALSO TRYING TO BUILD CAPACITY HAVE BEEN OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. AS WE'VE GIVEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT SOURCES RIGHT. I WILL SPEAK TO THE I. C. CHOICES BUT HE'S KEEPING HALF OF COURSE FOR THOSE ENTITIES. WE A CD. S. SIGNIFICANT FUSION. TO THE CARRIAGE ACT- THAT WAS A SUCH A GOOD THE MERCY SOLUTIONS GRANT PROGRAM OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION ATTENDED ALSO FLOWED. TO THOSE ENTITIES. I SEE A LOT OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS WITH FEDERAL FUNDS OR STATE FUNDS AND SO YOU'D THEY'RE DEALING WITH A LOT OF THAT- SO THAT IS A LESSON LEARNED I DON'T TO BE TOO. TOO LONG IN MY ANSWER BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND- THAT TO THE TO THE POINT I HEARD FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MONEY ALONE IS NOT THE ANSWER THAT'S WHAT WE THINK WE HAVE. YOUR ROBUST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS TO SEND TO THOSE COMMUNITIES OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS TO HELP NOT. ALL THE PLANS FIGURE OUT HOW TO SPEND THOSE MONIES. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT FROM A CAPACITY STANDPOINT- THERE STILL BUT DON'T GET DRESSED. THEY'RE STILL RAMPING UP AS WELL. SUCH AS ONE OF PROBABLY SEVERAL LESSONS LEARNED BECAUSE I THINK. THE PARTNERSHIP WE TALK ABOUT WE'RE PRETTY I THINK IT'S PRETTY GOOD AT THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL ACROSS DEPARTMENTS CERTAINLY IS ALWAYS WITH YOU CAN IMPROVE UPON. BUT THE LOCALS ARE PARTNERS HERE- WILL YOU SUPPLY COUNTY WE NEED A WILLING LOCAL PARK. WE'VE BEEN THRILLED THE DIFFERENCE SO MANY ONE LOCAL PARTNERS. RIGHT THERE HAS TO BE THE WILL TO DO THOSE EFFORTS THERE HAS TO BE THAT. THE ATTENTION AT THOSE LOCAL LEVELS. TO ALSO HIGHER UP. AND WORK WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDER. A COMMUNITY AND ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF SO THAT'S ONE LESSON LEARNED IF I DIDN'T GO. TO ACTUALLY LIKE HAPPY TO EXPAND ELSEWHERE. NO THAT WAS FINE I THINK IT'S HER FOR NUMBER. TO COME. WHEN THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE PART. ARE WORKING AT CROSS. YOU KNOW DO. PLAN ARE GREAT. AND IF FEEL LIKE THOSE OTHER ENTITIES AREN'T TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND WORKING TOGETHER IN A COORDINATED FASHION IT MAKES IT HARD FOR THE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS. TO DO WHAT FOLKS NEED TO SEE HAPPEN. BUT THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THEN LASTLY MY QUESTION TO CAL H. F. HEY WAS YOU. SHARED SOME VERY EXCITING INFORMATION AND GOOD NUMBERS- SO WHAT HAVE YOU SEEN THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO LEVERAGE YOU KNOW YOUR FINANCING ABILITY. AT THE STATE LEVEL TO LOWER CONSTRUCTION COSTS FOR THESE BILLS SO THAT WE CAN INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO ARE HOUSED EITHER THROUGH UNIT SIR OR IN HOMES. BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE A VERY STRONG LEVERAGING ABILITY FOR THE STATE. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- YES- WE DO RELY ON LEVERAGING A LARGE AMOUNTS OF- PRIVATE CAPITAL AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING- THE MIXED INCOME PROGRAM IS THE BEST EXAMPLE OF THAT AND THE- AND THE MULTI FAMILY LEVEL ON THE SINGLE FAMILY FRONT ALL WE ALSO LEVERAGE FIGHT LARGE AMOUNTS. OF PRIVATE CAPITAL- ASMARA DON'T THIS IS. UP ARE ARE BOTH OUR PROGRAMS RELY ON PARTNERS WITH PRIVATE- FOR EXAMPLE IN IN THE- AND ON THE SINGLE FAMILY FRONT. ALL LENDING DONE THROUGH FEDERAL CAN FOR. LOANS DAD- WE CAN- DRAW ON SECOND MARKET PRIVATE. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT RIGHT. HE MANAGED A EIGHT ONE TO TRY LEVEL RATIO. IN THE FOR A STATE GUY WE ARE WE SEE FOR PAYMENT WE ARE ABLE TO. TWENTY DOLLARS I. DOWN THE MESSAGE AND THE- ONLY REASON WE'RE TO DO IS BECAUSE WE HAVE A MODEL WHERE OUR LITTLE ARE UNDERRATED. TO OF SAN CAN. STANDARDS I SO THEN WHERE TO PACKAGE FIRST MORE. AND SALAS IN THE IN THE MORE TRILLION DOLLAR MARKET UNTIL IS A IT'S A VERY AND- YOU CAN HAVE SIZE THAT IF WE WANT TO FIND. YOUR KIND OF LOOKING FORWARD FROM MOBILE AND NOT A COMMITTEE THAT I. LOOKING ON FROM- DAD HOW WE- LOOK AT SOME THAT. ARE GOING TO ATTRACT PRIVATE CAPITAL AND THAT FOR. IN A SINGLE TIME FRONT CONFORM TO THESE FEDERAL STANDARDS WE CAN DRAW ON THE ON THIS. MARKET THAT'S LIKE THAT'S A BIGGER. TO LEARN AND THEN ON THE- MORE FAMILY FRONT OUT HOW CAN JUST FROM FOR. ONE OF THEM EXCITING THING WE ARE. WE'RE DOING TO ATTRACT- CAPITAL. HE'S A NEW RECYCLE BONTA- WE- IN I'M NOT THIS. IS HE- AS OLD- BY OUTLOOK CENTERS YOU KNOW YEAH. THE STATE. HE I THINK IT'S AN BOTTOM FOR. IS ONE OF THE ST WE HAVEN'T- WE YOU ALL DOLLAR. AND WE RESTS THEM FOR A NEW. RIGHT AND THAT ALLOW US THE NEW PART TO NOT COUNT TOWARDS THIS. DAYS BIG CONTENDERS LEMON DONE STATE AND WE ABLE TO THIS. THE CANNOT COME GONNA DOWN THAT WE'VE SET- COMMITTEE ON ACTUALLY- TO BRING WITH SOME LOCAL LIKE SEND AND I COME FROM. TO NEXT- AND YOU KNOW DISCUSS OF FINANCIAL MAKE WE ABLE. TO OPPONENTS AG AND OTHERS ARE DOING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M SO GLAD TO CLARIFY THAT BECAUSE WHEN YOU SAID RECYCLING BOND PROGRAM I WAS THINKING BOTTLES AND I WAS LIKE WELL HOW DOES THAT PLAY INTO HOMELESSNESS MONEY SO. THANK YOU FOR THAT SO NOW SENATOR WIENER I'M SURE YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS WOULD YOU LIKE TO ASK- THANK YOU- I'M- SORRY SIR BUT- THE PERSON TERMS OF. OUR PROJECT- HOME SHE- COULD IN TERMS OF TRANSITIONAL OVERSEAS. HOUSING BREAK DOWN THERE. YEAH HAVE YOU TO DO THAT- THAT COCA UP THE ACTUAL EXACT NUMBERS IF YOU LIKE FROM THE FIRST GO ROUND- THERE'S A BLAND AS WAS MENTIONED- OF WHAT WE ALLOWED FOR ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE SPEED WITH WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO OPERATE. OF THE INTERIM HOUSING VERSUS PERMANENT HOUSING AND WE ALSO SAW A NUMBER OF- PROJECT ESSENTIALLY BEING RUN AS INTERIM HOUSING THAT INTEND TO CONVERT TO PERMIT HOUSING OVER TIME AND THAT'S A GREAT FLEXIBILITY WE THINK ABOUT THE LOCAL LEVEL RIGHT BECAUSE THEY HAVE. THE LUXURY OF HAVING SEVERAL OF THESE PROJECTS YOU CAN KIND OF PHASE THEM INAPPROPRIATELY- AND MAKE SURE YOU'RE YOU'RE QUEUING PEOPLE TO THEIR TO THE RIGHT- THE WRITER MENTIONS SO TO SPEAK- SO IN THE FIRST IN THE HOPE YOU ONE POINT- THE NEXT. UP THE DATA HERE. WE SAW- TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED TWENTY OF THE WERE PER UNITS THOSE IMMEDIATELY COME OF PERMITS. HOUSE AND NOT MY- ONES FOUR NINE OR INTERIM AND THE REMAINDER ARE GOING TO BE INTERIM TO PERMANENT UNITS WE HAVE PUT UP A PUBLIC DASHBOARD FOR WHOM HE TWO POINT NO WE CAN ALSO SEE THE DATA AS WE GO- BURKE. SECOND GO AROUND- AND SO WE'RE WE KNEW WE TYPICALLY SEE THAT. SEE THAT KIND OF MAKE- ISSUES AT A PRICE THOSE INNER. RIGHT SO IF YOU'RE DOING EIGHT ACQUISITION OF A MULTI FAMILY BUILDING WITH WE'RE NOW SEEING- IT IN GREATER NUMBERS YOU'RE DOING A MOTEL HOTEL CONVERSIONS. TYPICALLY YOU'RE RUNNING THAT EITHER INTERMENT PERMANENT IT'S NOT LIKE HALF THE GENERAL MIN HAPPENS PERMITTED IT'S ALL ONE TYPE OF USE- IS THAT ADEQUATE YOU HAVE ANY. THANK YOU SIR. A GOAL FOR WHAT THE MIX. SHOULD BE OR ABOUT. LONG RUNNING BOTH ROB SUPER. IMPORTANT BUT THIS- WHAT MAY KNOW WE WERE TRY TO DRY A TO PREVENT HOUSE- WE KNOW THAT. THIS IS YOU KNOW HOW ALSO- AND SO WE REALLY TO DRIVE A THAT WE OF COURSE WITH OUR PARTNERS YOU KNOW THE DO THEY GET OUT FOR THE FLEX OF HERE. AND I THINK WE'RE PRETTY PLEASED THAT MANY OF THE ARE. EVEN IF THEY'RE GONNA RUN AS INTER- INITIALLY ARE THE OVER TO- THERE'S NOT WE DID NOT PRESCRIBE A RECALL. KIND OF NEXT THEIR BUT WE THROUGH THE PROGRAM AT STRUCTURE ASSEMBLY DRAW. HOME TO INCENTIVES TO PERMANENT HOUSE SO- YOU'LL SET YOURSELF ABOUT. ABOUT PERCENT OF THE GO AROUND WAS ENTERING. ONLY AND I THINK AS WE EVALUATE TO AS AS AS- APLIK COMING IN IT DOES MATTER ON THE COMMITTEE LED RIGHT YOU SAW SOME. JURISDICTIONS COMING FOR ONE HOME HE WENT NO THAT HAD NEVER DONE EVEN IF HOUSING PROJECT BEFORE. LET ALONE- HOW DO HAD MY SHELTER SOONER HOUSING MODEL ACTUAL ALLOW THEM TO A THEY HAVE AN OFFICE SOME OF EARLIER. WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE WORD WE WILL DO TO NEED FROM TRIBE. YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW SOME COME IN THERE DON'T DO NEEDS SO GET YOUR QUESTION WE ARE TRYING TO DRY BOOKS THE- SOLUTIONS. SO WE HAVE A SKI THIRTY FIVE. WE HAVE BEEN HOME SHE HAS ITS OWN STREAMLINING. LEGISLATION US STREAMLINED SPECIFIC SUPPORTIVE HOUSING- IF HE'D SEE CITIGROUP COMMENTS. YOU'RE NOT JUST FOR HOMES HE WHICH HAS GONE. BUT THE DECISION ON KEEP JUST IN GENERAL WHAT IS FUND GOING OUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE GROUND I DON'T NEXT TITLE WILL HAVE BEEN APPROVAL HOUSING BUILDER SURE COMMENTS DETAIL BUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IN TERMS OF THE. YEAH HELLO WHETHER THE APPROVAL PROCESS ACCELERATED AS WE. TO YEAH MEAN I THINK IT ALL CALLED EXAM RIGHT- OUR ABILITY TO THE FUNDS ON THE HOUSE CALIFORNIA HOUSE CELERY YOU KNOW THAT WAS THE BILLS WERE PROJECT THAT WERE NOT STUCK YES IT'S ALL ABOUT LOCAL. BUT BY THE FINAL PIECE OF FINE TUNING SO IN BEING ABLE TO MAKE THOSE AWARDS WAS ACTUALLY FOR WITH THEY WOULD HAVE SOUGHT FOR TAX RATES ARE BONDS THOSE PROJECTS ARE GONNA BREAK WITHIN SIX MONTHS RIGHT SO THAT'S THE SAME REQUIREMENT THAT THEY HAVE AT THE TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE AND SO WE'LL SEE A LOT OF SPEED THERE AND OF COURSE AS WE EVALUATE READINESS IN THOSE PROGRAMS WERE MAKING SURE THEY HAVE ALL THEIR ENTITLEMENTS AND ALL THAT. STUFF ON THE BROUGHT IN YOU KNOW THE HOKEY I MEAN. I WILL JUST. REITERATE THE LOCAL LAND USE CONFORMITY WAS VERY INTEGRAL AND THE SPEED OF THOSE PROJECTS IN TERMS OF SAYING THAT ANY PROJECT. AUTOMATICALLY COMPLAINTS THE LOCAL LAND USE AND SO. NOT NOT TO GET TOO IN THE WEEDS BUT THAT IS YOU KNOW AWAY YOU KNOW IT CAN READ IT. RIGHT A LOT OF- YOU KNOW WHAT TYPICALLY MEMBERS OF THE BEARS TO DELAYING HOUSING- ON THE ON ON THE WHOLE. I MEAN I THINK I THINK THE BEST THING TO TALK ABOUT HERE'S OUR WORK WITH OUR HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY- D. YOU KNOW OUR OUR STORIES ARE FORTUNATE ORTIZ UNDER NUMBER OF LAWS. ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE VARIOUS STREAMLINING EFFORTS SB THIRTY FIVE AND OTHERS. ARE HERE TO AND USE PROBABLY ALREADY SEEN THAT IN SOME OF SOME OF THE- COMMUNICATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH JURISDICTIONS SO FAR WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BREAK. LOOSE SEVERAL HOUSING PROJECTS. THAT BY AT LEAST BEGINNING WITH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND REMINDING THOSE RESTRICTIONS OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS- IN SOME CASES HAVING TO ESCALATE- YEAH I THINK IT. IS GOING TO BE QUITE HELPFUL BECAUSE I THINK WHAT WE DO SEE AN- A NUMBER OF STREAMLINING MEASURES HAVE PASSED. AND OUR CURRENT LAW. IS SO- ENFORCING THOSE LAWS WILL BE QUITE IMPORTANT. AS WE HIT THE NEXT HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE WHICH WERE ALREADY IN- WE SEE THOSE COMMITMENTS. AND THOSE RESOUNDS AS A CONTRACT. YOU KNOW AND NOW THAT WITH THE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES WE HAVE. YOU KNOW WE'RE GONNA HOLD COMMITTEES THAT CONTRACT. AND WHILE- WELL OF COURSE. THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DO NOT HAVE TO BUILD THE HOUSING THAT YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE MOVING. DATE AFTER AGAIN IF I ALL BARRIERS WITHIN THEIR LOCAL PROCESS SHE'S. AND THEY HAVE TO PROGRAMS THAT. WERE AND SO NOW WITH BIRTH AND PORTSMOUTH FORTY WE WILL BE A TO CHECK. REGULARLY IF THERE IS A IF THEY'RE HEARING TO WHAT AGREED TO AND THERE PROTEST. AND SO- THAT'S IS A COUPLE COUPLE THINGS I'D SAY I'M I THINK. IT'S A IT'S GOING TO BE A CONTINUED AFTER I WOULD SAY OKAY REFERENCE LEVEL ME SHE- TO ACT. A ARE FORTUNATE ORTIZ OF COURSE ALWAYS STARTING WITH TO. BUT ESCOLA WE NEED. I THANK THANK YOU. FOR THAT I DO JUST WANT TO. KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA. ABOUT HOW HOUSING. ARE BEING. SOME WERE IF BIG DATA SOME AREAS WE DON'T. WE HAVE TO WORK TO OUR TO TRY TO. ARE ACT TO DATA- WORSE LAST YEAR WE ARE A BILL SENATE BILL FOR SOME SEVEN TRY TO FIX OUR GOING. TO CORRECT OUR FUTURE ARMSTRONG TO WITH THAT DECISION BUT THE BASED WAS THAT IT SHOULD BE AS- DOING ITS OWN DO PROCESS TURF STUFF. ON BUT SO BE A LONG AS- GETS COLLECTED. AT AM SO WHERE ARE WE WITH- BUT- IT SHOULD BE DATA COLLECTIONS PLANS SO THAT WE HAVE COMPREHENSIVE DATA ON. ALL OF THE STREAMLINING ISSUED SOME AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CIVIL WHERE ARE WE SUPPOSED TO COME OUT IN JANUARY. FILE YEAH UM YOU KNOW STUFF HAPPENS- WHEN IS IT GOING TO COME OUT WHAT IS IT GOING TO LOOK LIKE- IT'S GOING TO INCLUDE ALL THE ELEMENTS OF SP. FOR SEVENTY SEVEN SINCE WE NEVER HEARD OF POLICY OBJECTION. TO THOSE- STUDIED- IT WAS MORE ABOUT I THINK- BUT SERVICE YEAH THANK. SO- SORRY SHOULD COMMENT ON THAT. SURE I'LL NOTE- ESPECIALLY IF A ARE NOT A- WE I'VE BEEN TAKING A TEST APPROACH TO DATA TURN AS WELL SO HAVE A AND- I DON'T THINK PORTAL ON OUR WEB THAT I FOLKS TO GO TO BECAUSE HS A THE A PRO REPORT. DE THESE DATA GOING AVAILABLE YES I REALLY DO ENCOURAGE FOLKS TEAMS THAT AND WE'VE SEEN AT DEFINITELY GREATER INSURANCE TO THAT REQUIREMENT TO SUBMIT THOSE REPORTS OVER TIME CITIES AS THE REQUIREMENTS HAVE GROWN AND SO THAT IT THAT IS VERY HELPFUL FOR DATA PERSPECTIVE WE WILL HAVE AMPLE OUR STATE WHAT HOUSING PLAN AND THE STATE DOES STRATEGY OUT VERY VERY SOON- AND SO YOU CAN LOOK FOR THAT IN THE COMING WEEKS- AND- THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT WITH THAT WE WERE TRYING TO ALIGN THE RELEASES OF THOSE TWO THOSE TWO ACTORS BECAUSE WE THINK THEY THINK THEY ARE. THEY GOING COMPLIMENTS SO WITHOUT BE OUT VERY SOON AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE OFFICE ON IT AFTERWARDS- OKAY SO NOW WE WILL GO TO MEMBERS IN THE COMMITTEE I SEE SENATOR COVER HEROES MY GRAZED AND SENATOR RON. MIKE REYES. THE SENATOR CABALLERO AS MIKE WAS RATES FIRST. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS FIRST I MEAN JUST THEM SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY HERE TODAY- WE HAVE PUT A LOT OF MONEY INTO CIRCULATION AND I THINK ARE A REAL ISSUE IS- PRODUCTION. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHERE HAVE WE GOTTEN THE BEST BANG FOR OUR BUCK SO LET ME JUST START OFF BY SAYING- THANK YOU AND THAT THAT IF THERE ARE RESOURCES THAT COME FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT HAVE TO BE. A BIT HAVE A- A TIME LINE TO THEM WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE SPEND DOWN TO THE PENNY- I DON'T WANT TO SEE S. RETURN MONEY. OUGHT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT DAVE- AWARDED THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO HELP US DEAL WITH OUR MOST INTRACTABLE ISSUES BECAUSE OF KOVIN. I DON'T WANT TO SEE S. NOT USE THAT MONEY SO THAT'S GOING TO BECOME REALLY IMPORTANT AND IF WE'VE- GOT MONEY OUT TO OUR- CITY AND COUNTY PARTNERS. WE'VE GOT TO BE USING AT ON TIME AS WELL BECAUSE WE CAN'T DEAL WITH THEM. SAYING OH BY THE WAY I GOT A MILLION BUCKS AND I DIDN'T USE IT- I WE JUST COULDN'T USE IT IN TIME SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE NUMBER TWO IS- THE KELLY CHIPPED A FIRST TIME HOME BUYER PROGRAM- I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN GIVE US. A MAP BY REGION. OF WHERE YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO DEPLOY. YOUR FIRST TIME HOME BUYER PROGRAMS THE DATA YOU GAVE US IS REALLY EXCELLENT- BUT I HAVE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT BUILD HOUSING THAT. ACCESSING THE FIRST TIME HOME BUYER PROGRAM HAS BEEN PROBLEMATIC AND SO IT MAY BE THAT IT. THAT IT'S BY THAT IT'S BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE- REQUIREMENTS THAT BETTER THERE AND I'D I'D LIKE THIS TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER. ON TO THE QUESTIONS- THIS ONE IS FOR THE INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS IN EACH CD. THE SACRAMENTO BEE REPORTED THAT- THREE ROOM KEY PROJECTS ARE SET TO CLOSE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY WHICH TOGETHER. TOGETHER TEMPORARILY HOUSE THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE HOMELESS PEOPLE. THE COUNTY STAFF ARE REPORTEDLY TRYING TO FIND OTHER HOUSING OPTIONS ARE HOTELS FOR THOSE BEING DISPLACED AND SO. THAT'S REALLY DISTRESSING- IF WE ALL WORK UP HERE SO WE UNDERSTAND AND SEE. THE SEVERITY OF THE HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM HERE LOCALLY- AND IT'S JUST A MICROCOSM OF WHAT YOU SEE ALL OVER THE STATE AND- TO. TO HAVE COME UP WITH A SOLUTION THAT. PUTS PEOPLEIN HOUSING FOR A YEAR OR TWO AND THEN BASICALLY TO NOT HAVE A SOLUTION A LONG TERM SOLUTION IS. I THINK UNACCEPTABLE AND- THE PUBLIC IS JUST NOT GOING TO UNDERSTAND IT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT FRANKLY SO I'M WONDERING IF. IF IF THERE'S A STRATEGY. FOR THE FACT THAT THOSE RESOURCES MAY BE ENDING AND SHOULD WE HAVE BEEN PLANNING BETTER. FOR A TRANSITION INTO OTHER KINDS OF HOUSING AND- AND BASICALLY WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT HOUSING THAT WE'RE NOT. WE'RE NOT CREATING TEMPORARY SOLUTIONS THAT DON'T GET US ANYWHERE DOWN THE ROAD. I CAN START A SLUSH SO I'M DEFINITELY AGREED AROUND THE NET THE IMPERATIVE TO HAVE A FULL CONTINUUM OF SOLUTIONS I THINK I MENTIONED EARLIER IN OUR ACTION PLAN FOR PREVENTING AND ENDING HOMELESSNESS IT WAS INCLUSIVE OF. A RANGE OF SOLUTIONS INCLUDING EMERGENCY TEMPORARY AND LONGER TERM HOUSING OPTIONS I WILL SAY THAT THE ROOM KEY. SIMILAR BY OUR PARTNERS AT CVS SO I DON'T TO PRESUME. OR I'M SPEAK ON THEIR BEHALF ON WHAT PLANS THE NINE. DOWNSHIFT EFFORTS. BUT I WILL SAY THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THAT I THINK- MARK ARE SORT OF OUR GRANTS WORK IS ABLE TO DO IS TO PROVIDE OUR- PARTNERS WITH THE ABILITY TO. REPROGRAM FUNDS SO THAT THEY CAN SOLUTION MIGHT BE. SO I GUESS I TAKE FROM THAT THAT IT'S UP TO THE LOCAL LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO COME UP WITH THE PLANT AND I GUESS- ONE OF THEM. ONE OF THE- I UESS SEVEN POINT I'D I'D PUT ON IT ACT. I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY THAT WE HAVE PUT OUT FUNDS. IN A REALLY RAPID. ON A REALLY RAPID BASIS AND THAT MANY OF THE- CCA'S DID NOT HAVE A PLAN A LONG TERM PLAN. FOR WHAT NEEDED TO HAPPEN IT WAS IT WAS IT WAS EMERGENCY- GET PEOPLE INTO HOUSING IMMEDIATELY WITHOUT THE LONG TERM PLAN OF OKAY NOW WHAT ONCE ONCE WE HAVE AMEND THE HOUSING WHERE DO THEY MOVE. THAT PROVIDES A SEMI PERMANENT OR PERMANENT SOLUTION FOR A WHILE SO I GET THAT IT IN MANY WAYS IT'S REALLY NOT FAIR BUT I REALLY THINK. THAT THE PLANNING THAT ALL OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE GOING TO BE DOING. AROUND HOME THE HOMELESS ISSUE. HAS TO INCLUDE HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE WE GOTTEN OFF THE STREETS AND ARE THEY OFF THE STREETS. ENOUGH ENOUGH. IN A PERMANENT AS MUCH AS YOU CAN SAY PERMANENT- SOLUTION BECAUSE- I THINKALL OF US ARE FEELING REALLY FRUSTRATED THAT THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO GROW BIGGER EVERY DAY DESPITE THAT THE- BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THAT WE'VE PUT OUT. AND AND MY FRUSTRATION PERSONALLY IS THAT IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO GET REPORTS FROM MY CCA'S LOCALLY IT'S DONE BY COUNTY AND SO I HAVE SIX COUNTIES IN TRYING TO GET INFORMATION ON. ON REAL DATA WHAT HOW MANY PEOPLE HOW MANY FAMILIES- HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO ASSIST IS GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT SO IT'S NOT JUST HOW MANY HOURS OF SERVICE OR- HOW MANY. TONS OF- PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS HAVE WE PASSED OUT IT'S REALLY IT HAD REALLY HAS TO DO WITH HOUSING AND I'M NOT I'M NOT I'M TRYING NOT TO BE CRITICAL BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THAT WE PUT OUT ALL THIS MONEY AND NOW WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BUILD A CAR- AND WE'VE DRIVEN IT A LITTLE BIT- BUT I REALLY HOPEFULLY THE PLANTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE COMING OUT. THE LOCAL ACTION PLAN TO BY JUNE WILL WILL HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD QUANTITATIVE MEASURES SO WE CAN EVALUATE. WHAT WELL SO THAT WE CAN SAY. WHO'S DONE IT WELL. BEYOND AND- HOW HAVE THEY DONE IT AND CAN WE REPLICATE IT IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE- BECAUSE- THIS THIS IS KNOW IT'S A HUMANITY ISSUE AND IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND. EVEN IF IT'S GOING TO TAKE US A LONG TIME WE'VE GOT TO START HAVING SOME SUCCESSES SO I GUESS I'M I WON'T WILL BE THIS TOO MUCH MORE BECAUSE I. I THINK YOU'RE DOING A GREAT JOB BUT I REALLY DO WANT TO SEE THE PLANS AND I WANT TO SEE- WHERE DO WE NEED TO PUT OUR RESOURCES SO WE'RE ACTUALLY BUILDING. THANK YOU RIGHT I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM SENATOR RAWSON AN AXE AFTER THAT I SEE THAT SENATOR- CHILLED BOWL HAS HER. A MICROPHONE UP WHOLE KATIE AND THEN SENATOR CORTESE. SENATOR ROB. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU KNOW- WE TALK ABOUT THE- THE HOMELESSNESS SITUATION WITH REGARD TO THAT DISCUSSION I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION A COUPLE QUICK OTHER ONES. WITH RESPECT TO THE HOMELESSNESS SITUATION DO WE DO WE KNOW WHAT PERCENTAGE OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION IS NOT INTERESTED IN HOUSING. AS SOON AS PRETTY LOW BUT I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION AND WITH REGARD TO THAT POPULATION WHAT DO WE PROPOSE TO DO ABOUT THEM. WOULD SOMEONE LIKE TO TAKE A CRACK AT THAT I DON'T THINK HE WAS ASKING ME. I'M HAPPY TO. START US OFF SO I THINK TO THE TO THE- MORE COMPLEX ISSUE OF- WHAT WHAT FOLKS SORT OF SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS SERVICE RESISTANCE I THINK IT'S A MUCH MORE COMPLEX ISSUE. AND ONE THAT WE CONTINUE TO- WORK TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING SO ONE OF THE THINGS TO BE THAT WE OFTEN THINK OUR IN OUR HOMELESSNESS ROUTE IS- WE MUST ENSURE THAT THERE ARE SERVICE RICH ENVIRONMENTS THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST START OFF WITH HOUSING. THAT PROVIDE A RANGE OF SERVICES THAT ARE PROGRAMS THAT INDIVIDUAL SO THAT THE HELP THAT WE ARE PROVIDING IS INELIGIBLE INDIVIDUAL THAT NEEDS AT A WIN THAT MEANS IS THAT. PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE CARE THEY NEED ASKING YET. YEAH I THINK THE SORT OF THE ART OF MAKING THAT HAPPEN IT'S A VERY COMPLEX ENDEAVOR- WELL NOT COVERED WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF WHAT WE DISCUSSED TODAY. I DO THINK THAT THE RANGE OF INVESTMENTS IN THE SERVICE PORTION OF HOMELESSNESS. THE SERVICE PORTION OF THE HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE SYSTEM WILL AID IN ASSURING A WIDER VARIETY OF SERVICE OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE. BUT YOU KNOW TO THE TO THE SORT OF YOUR CORE QUESTION AROUND WHETHER WE ARE CERTAIN OF WHAT. PROPORTION OF PEOPLE ARE OURS TO REFUSING SERVICE ARE UNABLE TO APPROACH THAT I THINK WE TEND TO THINK OF IT AS JUST I'M- MORE OF A OF A MATCHING OF SERVICES TO THE NEED ISSUE WE DO OUR POINT IN TIME COUNTS AND TO TRY TO DETERMINE. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY HOMELESS IN. IN COMMUNITIES AND COUNTIES I'M JUST WONDERING IF WE- ACTUALLY TRY TO DETERMINE HOW MANY OF THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS ARE HOMELESS BECAUSE THEY'VE LOST THEIR JOBS. AND THEY REALLY WANT A HOUSE OR AN APARTMENT OR WHATEVER. HOW MANY- HAVE NOT HAVE JOBS BUT AREN'T ABLE TO AFFORD A HOME OR AN APARTMENT. IN WHAT AN INCH OF THOSE PEOPLE. WE ON STREET OR OTHERWISE. WHO ARE PERFECTLY CONTENT WITH THEIR LIVES WHETHER WE'RE CONTENT WITH THE TYPE OF LIFE THAT THEY'VE CHOSEN. FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS- I WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT. IN TERMS OF MAKING FUNDING DECISIONS AND WHERE WE PUT OUR MONEY. AND I GESS THE ANSWER IS WE DON'T COLLECT THAT DATA IS THAT CRIMINALS. SO I'M A FOLLOW UP TO THAT THERE IS A SERVER THAT'S CONNECTED TO THE POINT IN TIME COUNT THE PREVAILING KNOWLEDGE IS NOT THE PRIMARY REASON FOR HOMELESSNESS IS THE AFFORDABILITY CRISIS THAT CONTINUES TO BE THE DRIVING SOURCE OF HOMELESSNESS. AND THE BARRIERS AND THE REASON WHY PEOPLE BECAME HOMELESS IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO THAT THAT THAT IS WHAT WE UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE DRIVEN BY WELL I CAN TELL YOU FROM AN ANECDOTAL STANDPOINT THE- REVEREND PEOPLE- SOME VETERANS. THAT I HAVE. SPOKEN TO ON THE STREET WHO ARE HOMELESS- VERY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE. A COLLECTION OF LIBRARY BOOKS OR THEIR OWN BOOKS WHICH IS A LIBRARY IN THE SHOPPING CART THAT THEY READ WHEN THEY'RE ON THE STREET. WHAT MADE A CONSCIOUS DECISION TO REMAIN THERE AND I THINK WE PROBABLY OUGHT TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BUT- I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THIS QUESTION EITHER. ME S. MICE MY SECOND ONE YOU KNOW. FOR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE AT THAT HAVE A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF COLLEGE STUDENTS. BUT THE COMMUNITIES SEEK TO HOUSE AND I REALIZED THAT STUDENTS ROLL OVER EVERY. FOUR OR FIVE OR SIX YEARS BUT THE NUMBER GENERALLY REMAINS CONSTANT. HAS ENTERED AS ABILITY MOVEMENT TO. COUNT THAT ADDITIONAL HOUSING THAT COMMUNITIES ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE THOSE STUDENTS. AGAINST THE COMMUNITY RINA ALLOCATION. I BELIEVE THAT THE QUESTION FOR CAN DORMITORIES COUNT TOWARDS A COMMUNITIES ARENA WELL I THINK THAT'S IT'S A LITTLE MORE NUANCED THAN THAT BECAUSE WE ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT A DORMITORY IS BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN TYPES OF HOUSING THAT COULD BE CONSTRUCTED OFF CAMPUS. WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT MEET THE EXISTING AT LEAST AS I UNDERSTAND IT DEFINITION OF HOUSING THAT COUNTS AGAINST RINA STUDENTS MAY NEED A DIFFERENT TYPE OF HOUSING. THAN SOMEBODY IN THE FAMILY WHO WORKS OR OF C. PERSON WHO WORKS- WITH OR WITHOUT FAMILY. IF IT IS PERMANENT HOUSING OFF SITE WORKS REPRESENTS A LEASE IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE ELIGIBLE. TOWARDS A RENEWAL. IS IT HAVE TO MATTER LOOK. DOES IT HAVE TO HAVE A FULL KITCHEN. DOES IT HAVE TO HAVE COULD HAVE SHARED BATHROOM FACILITIES- THOSE ARE LIKE I MEAN I THINK THOSE OF THE- CITY I THINK THOSE ARE THE OBSTACLES AT LEAST AS I UNDERSTOOD. THAT IT OR UNDERSTAND IT AND MY QUESTION IS WHERE YOUR STUDENT POPULATION IS CONSTANT. FOR EXAMPLE THE LARGEST CITY IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. HAS FOR COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WITHIN AS THE CITY LIMITS. SO OBVIOUSLY SOMEONE HAS TO PROVIDE THAT HOUSING BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES ARE UNABLE TO FULLY PROVIDED AND WHEN THE COMMUNITY DOES. WHICH TAKES UP A LAND WHICH TAKES OF RESOURCES DOES THAT HOUSING. KALYAN'S THE REALLOCATION. SO JUST A CLARIFICATION THE REALLOCATION IS ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE ZONED FOR SO WE'RE EVALUATING HOW- HOUSING- IT'S ABOUT WHAT HAS TO BE ZONED TO ACCOMMODATE THAT THE ULTIMATELY WHAT IS NOT THERE WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH JURISDICTIONS TO MAKE SURE COMPLIANCE- BUT TO BE CLEAR IT'S THE ZONING THAT IS REQUIRED SO THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE HIS OWN THAT LAND TO ACCOMMODATE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PARCELS OR HOMES- WHEN THEY GET TO THE SITE'S INVENTORY IN ORDER TO BE COMPLIANT WITH THREE. DAN HOW THE NEED THAT REMAINS WHAT THEY'RE PERMITTING IS A LITTLE BIT OF A SEPARATE PROCESS BUT HAPPY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH JURISDICTIONS AS THE KIND OF A BILL THAT CONTRACT ON THE READ IT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE COMPLIANT WELL GOOD I'LL WILL FOLLOW UP ON AN ISSUE AND FINALLY. ONE ONE LAST QUESTION. WITH REGARD TO THE VERY PROGRAMS THE LOW INCOME. HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM THE HOME BUYING ASSISTANT PROGRAM ANY OTHER PROGRAMS THAT. THEY WERE LISTED IN THE L. A. O.'S- DISCRETIONARY HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS SPENDING AUGMENTATION- LIST HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT THERE IS FUNDING EQUITY WITH REGARD TO THESE PROGRAMS AMONG THE VARIOUS REGIONS IN THE STATE I'M TALKING COASTAL URBAN VERSUS INLAND. MAY NOT BE TO TAKE THAT EVERY EACH AND EVERYONE OF OUR PROGRAMS AS GEOGRAPHIC TARGETS- IN THE DATA WE PROVIDED THE COMMITTEE CONSULTANTS WHICH I'M HOPING YOU SEEN HAVEN'T YOU KNOW HOPE WILL BE SHARED WITH YOU SOON- WE OUTLINED WHAT THOSE BREAKDOWNS ARE. SO YOU KNOW I WAS HERE JUST A COUPLE ANECDOTES- YOU KNOW I MENTIONED HUNKY THIRTY FIVE DIFFERENT COUNTIES MANY COUNTIES THAT NEVER EVEN PARTICIPATE IN A FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY DIFFERENT SITES AND- POINT OVERSEEING THIS. A REALLY GREAT GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD THERE. IN ORDER TO INFILL INFRASTRUCTURE GRANT PROGRAM AS I MENTIONED WE HAVE WILL BE SMALL COMMUNITIES AND A LARGER SUCCESSFUL JURISDICTION A LARGE JURISDICTION SET ASIDE. AND OF COURSE HAVE TARGETS BETWEEN ON NORTHERN SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL OR OR MORE RURAL AREAS SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS HAVE SPECIFIC RULES SET ASIDES- OFTEN FOR OVER THE COUNTER PROGRAMS AS WE DON'T WITH COMPLETELY IF WE SET REGIONAL SATISFIED. UP UNTIL A POINT TO ALLOW THEM TO SENSUALLY TAP INTO THOSE DOLLARS JUST IN THE REGION. OF FIRST BEFORE THEY'RE DEPLOYED TO KIND OF A GENERAL COMPETITION POOL AND- YOU MAY TOTALLY RIGHT AT HOME KEY- EACH AND EVERY REGION WAS OVERSUBSCRIBED AND WE'RE ABLE TO ALLOCATE WITHIN THOSE REGIONS AND SO- THERE IS A VERY INTENTIONAL EFFORT. TO DO THAT AT LEAST WITH AN H. P. PROGRAMS AND HAVING SPEAKING PROGRAM. SPECIFICS WHAT ARE THE TARGETS POPULATION BASED DURING THIS TRAINING I MEAN. YOU CAN HAVE TARGETS AND YOU CAN ASSIGN A TARGET TO REGIONS AND THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THERE'S FUNDING EQUITY BETWEEN THE REGIONS AND SO I'M JUST SORT OF CURIOUS AS TO. HOW THE PROCESS WORKS YES THOSE ARE ALL DRAWN BASED ON POPULATION AND DEPENDING UPON THE PROGRAM OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE SOME. SPECIFIC PROGRAMS WHEN YOU MAY THINK ABOUT OUR FORMER POPULATIONS WE MIGHT SEE. A DIFFERENT TYPE OF POPULATION OR NEEDS BASED ANALYSIS ON WHAT THOSE LAWS- THE SPREADING TO BE. SO EVERY PROGRAM IS DIFFERENT WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF TARGET CAN EACH PROGRAMS FOR SPECIFIC SUBPOPULATIONS SO WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THOSE. THOSE SUBPOPULATION DATA. OF THE FOR GENERAL PROGRAMS. IT IS. CONTENDED PICCOLI EQUITABLE IT AND ALL ALL KEY WE'RE- REQUIRED TO DO THAT I STATURE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SPONSOR THANK YOU MA'AM FOR YOUR- THANK YOU SENATOR ROB SO NOW WE WILL. FROM SO. OR GOOD MORNING AND WE'RE- LIKE TO THE POWER FOR. THEIR TESTIMONY MORNING. SURE THIS GRANT. FIRST OF ALL I LIKE TO THINK UP SENATOR FROTHING COVER YOUR FOR THE QUESTIONS I SHARE THE SAME CONCERN THE SAME THOUGHT PROCESS THAT YOU FOLKS HAVE EXPRESSED THIS MORNING TO THANK YOU FOR SHEREEN ARE ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS. MY QUESTION WOULD BE- FOR THE- FOR THE FIRST PANEL OF COURSE THE- QUESTION IS AS FOLLOWS WHEN ANALYZING THE ROOT CAUSES OF HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA WHICH WHICH STATE PROGRAMS HAVE PROVEN TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE AT ASSISTING PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO I DON'T KNOW OF THE L. A. O. THE OFFICES ON BUT THEY TOO COULD ALSO MAYBE HELP ADDRESS THAT. BECAUSE OF COURSE I'M SURE EACH PANELIST WOULD SAY IT WAS THERE BUT- OF COURSE I ALSO SAW MS LOW SO IF YOU WANT TO TAKE A CRACK AT IT. FEEL FREE. THANK YOU I'M SORRY I DO WANT TO FIND A COUPLE. THINGS THAT TELL A CH IS UNDER WAY WITH. I THINK IT BACK WILL. IMPART ADDRESS SOME OF THE SOME OF THE SORT OF. WHAT DRIVES THAT QUESTION SO AS I MENTIONED IN MY- EARLIER TESTIMONY ARE WORKING ON A STATE WIDE LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT THE PURPOSE OF THAT ASSESSMENT. IS TO FIRST UNDERSTAND- SORT OF- THE RESOURCES THAT WERE- DEVELOPED- THROUGH THE- FUNDING FOR THE STATE'S FUNDING FOR LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND THEN A SECOND QUESTION ABOUT RESEARCH WILL BE CONDUCTED ON SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONS- IN LOOKING AT. A LOCAL SYSTEMS OF CARE SO WHILE. I THINK I'LL I'LL I'LL DEFER TO OUR PARTNERS ALEJO I THINK WE'LL HAVE. WILL BE ABLE TO STEP BACK TO PROVIDE A BROADER PICTURE OF WHAT THEIR VIEWS ARE ON THIS. AND WE ARE EAGER TO BRING FORTH. THE RESULTS BACK LATER THIS YEAR. AND MORNING ONCE AGAIN AND HAS MORE HONEST WITH THE L. L. AS PASSED. A MAJOR DRIVER OF HOMELESSNESS IN THE STATE IS THE AFFORDABILITY HOUSING CRISIS. AND SENSITIVE OVER TIME TO BUILDING MORE HOUSING- SO THAT PRICES HAVE. COME DOWN ON PRICES AS HIGH AS THEY HAVE BEEN IN RECENT YEARS WILL BE SORT OF THE ROOT- ROOT RESPONSE TO ADDRESSING THOSE UNDERLYING ISSUES- OVERTIME. IN THE NEAR TERM WE KNOW THAT WE NEED FOR THE SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS. IMMEDIATE BEFORE THE STATE. AND- AS- JUNE JUNE LOWERED HER MENTION HERE THERE- IT'S AN SS BEING DONE THAT WILL COME AND FOR. WHICH PRO HAVE SORT OF. MOST OF TODAY AND WILL HAVE GUIDE. TO OVERTURN LIMITED DATA ON EXACTLY HOW. FUNDING HAS BEEN USED- THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PRODUCED A REPORT ON THE FIRST YEAR. HE SPENDING FROM TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND WE HAVE SOME INITIAL DATA FROM THE FIRST YEAR IT. HAPPENED TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY OF THESE ARE ONLY INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF HOW FLEXIBLE FUNDING. TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE BEEN USED AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT. THE STATE HAS MODIFIED WHAT'S ABILITY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN RECENT YEARS WE'VE TALKED A LOT TODAY ABOUT. HAVING MORE LOCAL ACTION PLANS THAT ARE SHOULD HAVE ROUTED IT IN DATA SO THAT WE CAN TRACK ACCOUNTABILITY OVER TIME. IT WILL TAKE. TAKE TAKE TIME FOR OUR- FOR THAT DATA TO BE AVAILABLE TO THE STATE. PERFECT I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THAT THE- COLLECTION THEY DO THAT. JUST GATHERING AND ON THAT NOTE I DO HOPE THAT- WE DO SOMETHING WITH- ANSWERING SENATOR ROBERTS QUESTION. AND IT'S ANOTHER COUPLE YEARS I DID WANNA MENTION REALLY QUICK THAT THERE IS A- THAT THERE IS A GROUP IN MY IN MY DISTRICT THAT HAS BEEN INTERESTING JOB THE COST IN HOMELESSNESS. IN GETTING PEOPLE INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THEN DOING- PROVIDING WRAP AROUND SERVICES- TO HELP INDIVIDUALS LEARN- FINANCIAL LITERACY. AS WELL AS AB GETTING JOB SKILLS TRAINING- TO GET HIM INTO EVENTUALLY WHAT WOULD BE PERMANENT HOUSING AND THEY'VE BEEN VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL SOMETHING THAT WE MIGHT WOULD NOT LOOK AS A MODEL- IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE BUT IT IS MY DISTRICT ARE BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH ANYONE WHO MAY BE INTERESTED. IN CONNECT THEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR- OTOBO SOLD NOW WE WILL HAVE QUESTIONS FROM SENATOR CORTESE AND THEN AFTER THAT SENATOR NELSON SENATOR CORTESE. THANK YOU MEASURE AND- I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS A COUPLE COMMENTS. ONE OF THEM IS- AS TO THE QUESTION THAT THOSE SENATE ROTH WAS. WAS BRINGING UP- IT'S NOT MY ROLE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION ON. A STATEWIDE BASIS BUT CERTAINLY IN OUR COUNTY SANTA CLARA COUNTY THE POINT IN TIME COUNT THE CENSUS THOSE. A PRESENT THE QUESTION- AS TO WHETHER OR NOT- THE DION HOUSE INDIVIDUALS WILLING TO- ENROLL OR IN INTO HOUSING- DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO HOUSING AVAILABLE FOR THEM AT THAT MOMENT THEY ARE ASKED THAT QUESTION THAT. THAT HAS BEEN RUNNING THE LAST FEW YEARS AT APPROXIMATELY 3% NO 97% YES- BUT IT'S NUANCED IN TERMS OF FOLKS WHO ARE WILLING TO GO INTO GROUP COULTER'S VERSUS FOLKS WERE WILLING TO GO AN INDIVIDUALIZED INDIVIDUALIZED TINY HOMES OR- OR SUCH- SO I BELIEVE TO. THAT INFORMATION MAY BE AVAILABLE IN OTHER COUNTIES ARE DOING POINT IN TIME CENSUS- MODELING. ALONG THE SAME TYPE OF Q. AND A TO THE TO THE UN HOUSED INDIVIDUALS AT THEIR ENCOUNTERING IN THE FIELD AND THAT INFORMATION SHOULD BE- SHOULD BE. SORT OF TRICKLING UP OR UP LOADED THE TO THE STATEWIDE DATA I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION TO UNDERSTAND AS WE- CONTINUE TO TRY TO DETERMINE. WHERE THE INVESTMENT SHOULD GO IN IN TERMS OF- OF THE SHELTER SIDE OF THINGS PARTICULARLY- IT WHETHER OR NOT DOLLARS INTO INTO. A GROUP TYPE STUDIES IS GOING TO GET US UP MUCH LESS RETURN ON INVESTMENT SO TO SPEAK SO I DON'T KNOW- THAT THAT RESPONSE HEALTH CENTER ROTH AT ALL BECAUSE YOU PROBABLY ALREADY KNOWS THAT ROLE TO HIS TO HIS OWN HOME TURF BUT I THINK THE REAL ISSUE IS- IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION AT THE STATE AND I THINK HE SAID THAT- THAT WE SHOULD BE GATHERING THAT WE HAVE FROM THE LOCAL COUNTY SO. WHICH IS IT A COMMON UNLESS SOMEBODY WANTS TO RESPOND- ALONG THOSE LINES. I'M TO CONTINUE IF YOU DON'T BUY MELCHER- I AM CONCERNED ABOUT. THIS GRAPH ON PAGE THREE OF. THE L. A. O.'S- HANDOUT. WHICH IS RECENT TRENDS IN PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. YOU KNOW IN EIGHT EITHER OBVIOUSLY OBVIOUSLY THERE'S BEEN RELATIVELY SPEAKING- SOME SUCCESS IT IT REDUCING- OR SHELTERING PEOPLE- YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF KEEPING. KEEPING NUMBERS FLAT BUT THE UNSHELTERED NUMBERS HERE. OUR. YOU TO MOVING UP AT A PRETTY RAPID PACE IN IT MY CONCERN IS. HOW ARE WE MAKING DECISIONS BUDGET WISE TO GET BACK TO WHY WE'RE HAVING THIS HEARING IN THE FIRST PLACE. IN TERMS OF THIS GOING BACK THIS ISSUE INTERIM HOUSING OR SHELTER. A PERSON'S PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING- THAT'S THE QUESTION IN IMAGES THAT ADDITIONAL BACKDROP REAL QUICKLY- I KNOW THE- WE'VE HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT ALREADY HAS SINCE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION PUT A TREMENDOUS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING VERSUS SHELTER- BUT ALSO NOTE THAT. UP FROM HIS THE MANY MANY- OF OUR OUR PEER CITIES IN THIS REGARD IN OTHER STATES THE- IT WAS REALLY DRIVEN BY AN EAST COAST MENTALITY WHERE PEOPLE. HAVE BEEN SHELTERED HAVE BEEN WAREHOUSE FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME IN VERY COLD WEATHER STATES WHERE THEY COULD NOT LEAVE THE ON HOUSING SHELTERED. IN THAT PUSH. UP FOR SO CALLED HOUSING FIRST OR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING- WAS INTENDED TO. TWO ELITE V. EIGHT- THAT WAREHOUSING OF PEOPLE AND GET THEM INTO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING OUT OF SHELTERS INTO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING HERE CALIFORNIA. AREN'T SHELTERED AS EVIDENCED BY THIS GRAPH AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER INFORMATION BEFORE US ARE RIPARIAN CORRIDORS CREAKS UNDERPASSES- SIDEWALKS. IT EITHER WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T HAVE- WE DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE NEAR THE CAPACITY WE NEED IN TERMS OF SHELTER WE'RE NOT WE'RE HOUSING PEOPLE IN SHELTERS WHERE WE'RE HOUSING PEOPLE IN CREEK BEDS TYPICALLY- IN SO I'M CONCERNED THAT. ALTHOUGH SOME OF THIS PIECE WE HEARD SOME OF THESE DOLLARS ARE AND I TOOK THAT AS BEING PROJECT HOME CARE BEING ALLOWED TO GO IN THE INTERIM HAS EITHER 20% CLIP- THAT WE'RE LOSING GROUND AT THAT RATE. CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT. WELL AS I NOTED WE TRY TO DRIVE FOLKS TO PERMANENT HOUSING- SO IT DEPENDS ON THE COMMUNITY THERE'S A LOT OF THEM BIG PUSH TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY WITH FUNDS I ONCE BECAUSE HE PER HAPPENS THEY KNOW THE CONTINUUM OF WHICH SERVER IS ALL THE WAY FROM SHELTER UP TO PERMITS FOR HOUSING- A CELL LIKE AS I MENTIONED ARE COMMUNITIES THAT HAD LITERALLY NO PLACE FOR THE ON HOUSE TO GO. AND THEY MAY HAVE CHOSEN AN INTERIM HOUSING MODEL BUT WHAT IT WAS WHAT HOME HE WAS DOING TO BE CLEAR WAS BRINGING NEW CAPACITY ONLINE IT DID NOT EXIST BEFORE SO EVERY SINGLE UNIT WHETHER ENSURE PERMANENT WAS BRINGING SOMEONE IN BOOKS. WITH EVERY DOOR OR UNIT CREATED. WHETHER WAS INTERIM PERMANENT SO IN SOME COMMITTEES A MAN MADE THE CHOICE TO DEVELOP A CONTINUUM OR- USE THAT FLEXIBILITY TO ACQUIRE PROPERTY AND RUN IT IS AN DRUM. IN THE NEAR TERM SO THEY COULD BRING THOSE FOLKS INDOORS WHILE THEY- WORKED ON PERMANENT SOLUTIONS- THE DALLAS LARGELY ALLOWING LOCAL NEEDS TO HELP DRIVE THAT AFTER. AND IN HOCKEY ONE POINT OH THE PRIORITY WAS GIVEN TO THOSE THAT WERE REALLY PERMANENT HOUSING FOR CONVERSION TO PERMANENT HOUSING. IN THAT HIERARCHY ALL NOTICES THAT THE FLOOR HERE YOU KNOW THAT WAS USING FEDERAL FUNDS WEEK BUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE DOLLARS AND WE CAN PUT MORE INTO IT. DUE TO THE DEMAND- I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT ACD IS INDIAN BY HEART IS THE NUMBERS ARE STATE CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN THE NUMBER ONE STATE. EXPENDITURE OF CDBG FUNDS. AND OTHER FEDERAL DOLLARS SINCE JULY TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WE ARE DEFINITELY PULLING EVERYTHING. WITH YOUR CONSENT NEEDS. FOR THIS CRISIS AND OUR PARTNERS ARE DOING THE SAME THE LOCAL LEVEL SO- I THINK THE AS YOUR QUESTION IS LARGELY. GETS TO WHAT WE MAY SEE IN SOME OF THOSE LOCAL PLANS AS HARRY ACCOMMODATING BOTH YOUR NEEDS ARE YOU DRIVING ALL YOUR RESOURCES INTO. INTERIM OR TEMPORARY SOLUTIONS AND WHAT'S THAT BALANCE IT'S GOING TO VARY BY COMMUNITY- MY CANADIAN CELL IN THE CASE OF MONKEY THOUGH. THAT'S BRINGING ON NEW CAPACITY WORK DIDN'T EXIST IT'S NOT ABOUT PUTTING MORE MONEY INTO. EXISTING SHELTER SPACE. IT'S BRING. UP BUILDING THAT CONTINUE WHETHER ONE NINE IN. I JUST TO SEE IT AGAIN IT'S CENTER- OPINION- AGAIN IN THE CAR OF- I CULTURE AND IN THE HUNDRED. NINE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PONDERED SANTA CLARA COUNTY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN- STRICTLY FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING NONE FOR SHELTER IT'S VERY TYPICAL OF OTHER COUNTIES IN THE BAY AREA ALAMEDA. A TO SOME DEGREE SAN FRANCISCO- SIX YEARS LATER WE'VE GOT FORTY FOUR HUNDRED PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING UNITS- AND THERE'S MORE IN THE PIPELINE SO THAT MONEY IS WORKING FOR FROM THIS BOARD OF HOUSING SIX YEARS LATER OUR UNSHELTERED POPULATION IS OVER TEN THOUSAND IT'S INCREASED NOT DECREASED. IN ITS FROM OF A PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY STANDPOINT IT'S NOT WORKING BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE ARE PAYING THE BOND. BUT THE DRIVE TO WORK AND SEE. UP MORE TENSE MORE A SHELTERED IN EIGHT EIGHT I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THAT. WHATEVER THE RADIUS OF THE RATIO OF DOLLARS AT THE STATE LEVEL BETWEEN NINE CHILDREN PERMITS SUPPORT OF HOUSING. IS NOT ALLEVIATING THAT PROBLEM AT A LOCAL LEVEL AND IT'S CREATING SEVERE BACKLASH IN OUR COMMUNITIES SO. YOU KNOW YOU COULD ARGUE THAT I'VE BEEN PART OF THE PROBLEM BECAUSE I PUT UPON TOGETHER THAT WAS ONLY FOR FROM SUPPORT OF HOUSING- BUT THERE'S ALWAYS TIME TO CORRECT. THEY MAKE COURSE CORRECTIONS IN THAT SO THAT'S ALL I'M SUGGESTING AT THIS POINT BEFORE YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN EVEN GREATER A PUBLIC BACKLASH FROM OUR COMMUNITY OR COMMUNITIES PLURAL. LASTLY COULD YOU SPEAK SOMEONE SPEAK ONE MORE TIME ON WHAT WE'RE DOING. OR HOW WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO. INCREASED TAX CREDIT THE OTHER CAL EACH OF THE PROGRAMS- OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE OVERSUBSCRIBED I JUST DIDN'T HEAR THE PART ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING ABOUT. THE OVERSUBSCRIBED HERO UNDER CAPACITY IF YOU WILL A RELATIVE TO NEED FOR THOSE PROGRAMS. SURE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT SUGGESTS JUST TO CLARIFY- KELLY TO SAY- IS NOT ADMINISTER THE STATE PROGRAM THAT COMES TO MIND IS- TAX CREDIT COMMITTEE- MANY CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS LOCATION COMMITTEE ON MESQUITE KAKA CITRUS OFFICE. BUT I CAN SPEAKING BROADLY- I SHOULD BE WE ARE ONE AND MAIN USERS OF STATE OF THE PROGRAM AND ALL ALL THE- HOUSE MARKET AROUND. BY THE SIX COMMITTEE. ON THE- DELANO CASE YOU CAN SAID LACK SO- IN. OF ALL HOUSING BONDS AND THE- WHEN. PRESS AND GO TO FUNDS WHICH- ARE THINK THAT THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TO. DEFINITELY IS PART DAY THE NUMBER- FINANCING COMES TO MORE SINGLE MOST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION TO THAT PROBLEM IS FEDERAL- TANKING. WAS ACTUALLY INCLUDED IN THE- LASTED REYES ARE THE BILL BACK BETTER. NOW IS BEING CONTINUE BY CALL. LATE INTO THE TWENTY ONE. INCLUDE COMING TO PAY ANIMAL CORNERS AND ADMINISTRATION AND OTHERS STRONG FOR THE FOR DISCRIMINATION THAT WOULD ALLEVIATE HI ARMONK CONSTRAINTS IT'S A PROVISION CALLED LOWERING THE 50% TEST A LOWERING IT 225% WHAT IT ESSENTIALLY DOES JUST TO BOILING DOWN. IN DOUBLES THE CAPACITY OF THE STATE'S FOUR BILLION DOLLARS HOUSING MOM LIMIT DOUBLES ITS CAPACITY TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING SO IF RIGHT NOW IN BILLS ABOUT SEVENTY THOUSAND UNITS PER YEAR YOU IN DOUBLES AND- WITH EXPLANATION SO THAT IS A SORELY NEEDED. A SOLUTION- WHILE. WE ARE WAITING FOR THE FEDERAL. AND CERTAINLY FAME. I STARTED A WHAT'S CALLED A MORE RESIGN PROGRAM AND IT IS ONE OF THE ONLY OTHER WAYS THAT CAN KIND OF GO AROUND- THEY SET A- HOUSING CAN AND WENT I HEARD THAT PART DID MUCH TO HAVE TO REAP THE YEAH HEARD THEIR BODIES SO PIECE TO IT WOULD TO IN TERMS OF STATE FUNDS TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THE CAPACITY- EVEN ON A ONE TIME BASIS IF SO I DON'T NEED THAT NOW BUT I WOULD ASK TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO. YOU KNOW TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES- SO THAT WE KNOW. RELATIVE TO OUR OVERALL BUDGET. WHAT THE NUMBER WOULD LIKE. AND I SUPPOSE I SHOULD JUST ASK FOR IT BECAUSE SOMEBODY WOULD BE ABLE TO GIVE A SET NUMBER SO UNLESS I'M WRONG IS THAT- SOMETHING THAT WE CAN EXPECT TO GET. YES THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU- I SAID LAST LEAVE MANAGER I DID HAVE A QUESTION FOR SENATOR WINNER AND IT WOULD BE MY LAST QUESTION OF THE OF THE MORNING IF I CAN ASK IT- CENTER WINTER STILL AVAILABLE HE STILL OF THIS GREAT SENATOR- IS YOU KNOW- DESPITE THE FACT THAT I WASN'T YET IN THE SENATE A WELCOME AND LONG TIME SUPPORTER BUT SB THIRTY FIVE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE RUNNING INTO. BY WHICH I HAVE WELL DOCUMENTED- THROUGH CONSTITUENT SERVICES AND IN MY DISTRICT OFFICES THAT WE HAVE LOCAL CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS IN THE LARGEST CITY IN MY DISTRICT SAN JOSE- TELLING CONSTITUENTS WHO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE COMMUNITY MEETINGS AROUND SIMPLY COSMETIC ISSUES- ABOUT PROJECTS- HOW MANY TREES ARE PLANTED WITH THE VIEW SHEDS ARE GOING TO BE- TYPICAL NEIGHBORHOOD CONCERNS ARE BEING TOLD THAT- TALK TO YOUR STATE SENATOR BECAUSE- UNDER SB THIRTY FIVE- WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE SUCH MEETINGS AND I KNOW THAT WASN'T THE INTENT OF THE BILL OR FOR WAS YOU CAN STRAIGHTEN ME OUT. OF HERE ANY THOUGHTS ON. ON ON HOW WE CAN RESPOND TO THAT A BECAUSE INVITES FOR SUPPORTING SB THIRTY FIVE ONE IF THERE COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE TELLING CONSTITUENTS OF THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE COMMUNITY ABOUT SB THIRTY FIVE BOB PROJECTS- WE GET SURPLUS DRILLING IN THE BACKGROUNDS- ST I THOUGHT THAT'S NOT ACCURATE- THEY CAN ACT YOU NEEDING. AND. NINE EXAMPLES NUMBER. WHERE MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND UNITS AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ANTI PERMITTED ON THE REST THIRTY FIVE. FIVE DID THEY SAW COMMUNITY- GO THE LOSSES IN MAY XCUSE MEETING BUT THEY DO AND SOME A NEW WINS AND I THINK BY TYPICALLY AS A AS A BUILDER WATER FOR HOUSING OR MARKET RATE. IT IS ALWAYS IN YOUR INTEREST TO HAVE FRIENDLY. A CITY- AND SO WHAT WE FIND IS A LOT OF TIMES BILLS WILL GO TO THE CITY AHEAD OF TIMES AND THIS IS WHAT WE WANT TO DO- AND- WORK THROUGH ISSUES ARE WORK FOR EXCUSE WITH NEIGHBORS AND THEN SUBMIT AN SB THIRTY FIVE- APPLICATION. AND THAT'S I THINK THIS SMART THING TO DO- AS A AS A BUILDER BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT CITIES IF THEY REALLY WANT TO BE HOSTILE NINE CAN FIND WAYS TO MESS WITH THE. PROJECT ON I'M HAPPY TO- CHAT ABOUT THIS MORE- ALL- BECAUSE OUR GOAL IS NOT BEEN SO NOW HAVE USE MEANT. BUT RATHER AVOID THESE AND THEY PROCESSES SO I RIGHT WITH ACTUALLY TO LEARN MORE FROM IN TERMS WHAT YOU'RE- IN A PRETTY DIVERSE EMOTIONAL CERTAINLY YOU UP ON THAT OFFLINE IN. I THINK IT'S AN EDGY- EFFORT IF ANYTHING THAT'S NEEDED AND IT MIGHT. WILL BE DONE THROUGH ARKANSAS- COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS- LCMS AND THINGS LIKE THAT IF WE HAVE THE RIGHT. A BERBER THE RIGHT MESSAGE THAT'S AVAILABLE TO LEGISLATORS TO PUSH OUT A TO CONSTITUENTS- A TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE EDUCATED THEY KNOW THAT THEY HAVE THE RIGHT. TO ASK THEIR LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES- FOR THOSE KIND OF COMMUNITY MEETING SOME SOUL FOR TALKING THE OFFLINE AND MANAGER THANK YOU FOR- TOLERATING MY SEVERAL QUESTIONS- APPRECIATED. IN THANK YOU FOR CONDUCTING THE HEARING TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND HAVE FINALLY SENATOR NIELSEN YOUR- THE PHONE HAS BEEN UP THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THE- ANY QUERY OF THE LEGEND HONEST. I WAS ATTRACTED TO- THE SAME. CHART THE MY COLLEAGUES FROM SAN JOSE HAS MENTIONED. FOR THE LONGEST PERIOD OF TIME. AS I WATCHED THE- STATE AND LOCAL RESPONSE TO. HOMELESSNESS WERE SHELTER LISTS THIS. I LIKEN IT TO A- AN ABSTRACT ARTIST WHO COMES INTO A- WHITE PAINTED ROOM WITH A BUCKET OF PAINT. AND A PAINT BRUSH. AND JUST START FLUSHING THE PAINT. ON THE WALL. CONDENSING THAT TO A SIMPLE. QUESTION. THE LEGEND LIST HAVE WE EVER. IN DEALING WITH THE HOMELESS POPULATION. REQUIRED OF STATE AND FEDERAL STATE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. TO ASSESS THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF THE HOMELESS PERSON THE HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL. AND WHAT I'M GETTING AT IS SOMETHING THAT I BELIEVE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL FOR DECADES DEALING WITH K. TWELVE. STUDENTS WHO ARE CHALLENGED. IT'S CALLED I. E. P. INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PLAN. WHERE THOSE STUDENTS ARE ASSESSED. IN A PLAN IS LAID OUT NEEDS. THEY HAVE THAT USED TO BE MORE FUNCTIONAL SUCH AS DEALING WITH DYSLEXIA. PUT THE ANALYST WITH THE HOMELESS POPULATION. DO ANY AGENCIES OF STATE AND NORTH LOCAL GOVERNMENT EVER MAKE THOSE INDIVIDUALIZED ASSESSMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL AND THEN DO WE FOLLOW UP AND DIRECT THEM TO RESOURCES TO HELP THEM ADDRESS SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE. SUCH AS SUBSTANCE ABUSE DO WE DO THAT DO WE HAVE I. E. PLEASE. FOR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS. NOT YOUR QUESTION SENATOR I WOULD DEFER TO THE COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS OR PERHAPS SOME OF THE LOCAL PARTNERS UNDER HER THE NEXT TIME TO TALK SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHAT INTAKE LOOKS LIKE AS THINGS ARE CONNECT WITH A PERSON EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS BETTER SPEAKING TO HAVE MORE BROADLY THE FUNDING IS PROVIDED THE PROVIDED IN RECENT YEARS FOR HOMELESSNESS HAS BEEN TO QUITE ROD TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS INTO THE INTENT IS REALLY TO PROVIDE A CONTINUUM OF SERVICES THAT REALLY SORT OF MEET THE NEEDS ON THE GROUND AND SO. THE INTENT OF LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS WHAT WOULD% BE T RELEASE OF STAR OF THE INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS- BASED ON CERTAIN THE COMPLEXITY THAT THEY MIGHT BE FACING- I SEEN THAT CERTAIN STERLING- WHO HAS CONTACTED A DIFFERENT HER TO TALK ABOUT MORE ABOUT WHAT THAT INTAKE MIGHT LOOK LIKE THANK YOU AND IN THE SECOND PANEL PANEL CENTER NIELSEN WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM SOME DEVELOPERS AND ADVOCATES- WHO WORKING IN THE SPACE SO THEY MAY. BE ABLE TO HELP ADDRESS THAT AS WELL. WELL THAT WOULD BE IN I DO THINK THAT THAT'S A TO BE A PART OF THE- OF THE FUTURE TO ADDRESS. ADULT METALURH LIKE TO TERMINATE THE FUNDAMENTALIST OBSERVATION. AND IF ANALYSTS OR ANYONE WISHES TO RESPOND THEY MAY. BUT FOR SEVERAL YEARS OVER A DECADE AT LEAST. A MOVEMENT OF THE STATE TOWARDS WHAT'S CALLED REALIGNMENT HAS BEEN IN PROCESS. I SUMMARIZED REALIGNMENT AS BEING TAKING STATE RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUMPING IT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. OFTEN WITHOUT THE RESOURCES TO DEAL WITH. THE QUESTION WOULD BE AS A PRODUCT OF REALIGNMENT IN CALIFORNIA. HASN'T THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE HOMELESS CRISIS THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH. TENS OF THOUSANDS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOW FITTED TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AS THEIR PROBLEM. HASN'T THAT BEEN ONE OF THE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS. HOMELESSNESS IS A VERY COMPLEX PROBLEM ARCHITECT YOU KNOW HISTORICALLY THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR DRIVERS IS THE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CHALLENGES ACROSS THE STATE- WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL SPENCER OF A LARGE SHARE OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING AND SO UNEXPECTED EXPENSE OR JOB LAST WEEK COULD PUSH SOMEONE TO HOUSING AND- HOMELESSNESS THERE SOMEONE MIGHT EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS AS WELL AS YOU MENTIONED YOU THEIR NUMBER OF AREAS WHERE THERE IS A SORT OF STATE LOCAL ON REALIGNMENT OF SOME SERVICES- THE LOCAL COUNTIES IN PARTICULAR ARE PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERY TO MANY OF THE OF THE STATE'S. HOUSING AND I'M SORRY- HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS AND SO THERE HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN TO THE MECHANISMS FOR THE STATE TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO COUNTIES FOR THOSE SERVICES- AS I MENTIONED IN THE PRESENTATION OF THE TABLE THAT WE DEVELOPED REALLY FOCUSES ON FUNDING WITHIN CERTAIN THE CORE HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS. PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED BY THE STATE THERE HAS ALSO BEEN TO THE- FUNDING IN THE ORDER OF SERVICE I THINK LOW BILLIONS OF DOLLARS PROVIDED TO OTHER STATE ENTITIES PARTICULARLY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT SORT OF AIMS TO GET AT SOME OF THE MORE SORT OF COMPREHENSIVE ISSUES WHERE SOMEONE MIGHT BE- EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THAT THEY TO. GET GET THAT YOUR QUESTION WERE HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOUR OFFICER TO MORE INFORMATION ABOUT. INVESTMENTS IN THE SPACES. THANK LAST ONE MEMORY STICK IN MY MIND OF A ADVOCATE TESTIFYING AT A FORM AND AREA THAT I REFER. AND THIS PERSON WAS VERY ADAMANT THAT. WE COULD CONSTRUCT SHELTERS. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HOMELESS. IF WE EXPEDITED PERMITTING. GETS TO THE OMINOUS WORDS SEQUEL- PROCESS SIX. SHE WAS VERY ADAMANT THAT WE COULD REDUCE THE COSTS OF PROVIDING A HOUSING VERY SUBSTANTIALLY THICKER FIGURE SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER UNIT. IF WE ADDRESSED SOME OF THE REGULATORY IMPEDIMENTS OR IN POSITIONS. I DON'T SEE IN MANY OR IF ANY OF THESE PROPOSALS OVER THE YEARS. NORTH CURRENT. ANY MENTION. OF EXPEDITING THE PERMITTING FOR HELP HOMELESS SHELTERING. IS ANYONE AWARE OF ANY ATTEMPTS TO EXPEDITE PERMITTING FOR LOW INCOME AND OR PARTICULARLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS SHELTERS OR HOUSING. SO I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT THIS- OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE CURRENTLY HAPPENING OR EXPLORE PROPOSED TO HAPPEN THIS YEAR THERE WAS A BILL THAT WAS PASSED A FEW YEARS AGO THAT WOULD EXPEDITE- THE CONSTRUCTION OF- TRANSITIONAL HOUSING AND SHELTERS IN LOSSING AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY IT WAS- CARRY BAG. OF AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AND I DON'T KNOW MAYBE SENATOR WIENER CAN I'M NOT SHARE IF IT WAS KIND OF THE WHOLE STATE YEAH ORDER ON THE CENTER NIELSEN- AND WE ACTUALLY. ALL OF THE STREAMLINING BILLS- WE DISCUSSED TODAY- FIFTY TWO YEAR IS PROJECTS OUT OF STEEP ONE ON NOT LIKE. SUPER STREAMLINED CIRCLE LITERALLY REMOVED SEQUEL SO SB THIRTY FIVE PROJECT IS COVERED BY SB THIRTY FIVE WHICH RIGHT NOW I'M LOW INCOME HOUSING SUPPORTED HOUSING THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE CENTRAL IS COVERED BY SB THIRTY BUCKS IT'S SIMPLY NOT SUBJECT TO SEE WHAT ALL. WE ALSO THAT WAS SUITABLE EIGHT- ON THAT STREET BUT REMOVES I WILL RECALL NAVIGATION CENTERS LOW LOW BARRIER HOMELESS SHELTERS. OUT OF SEQUENCE FINALLY THAT ENDED UP TO BE PASSED AS PART OF THE BUDGET. ASSEMBLY MEMBER DAVID CHIU. SO WITH US. AND LEGISLATURE ON AUTHORED A LAW THAT SPECIFICALLY TALKS RECORDED HOUSING. OUT OF SHE BROUGHT SO WE DEFINITELY- TRUSTS YOU CAN ALWAYS DO MORE. THE ISSUE OF THE SUIT BROUGHT DELAYING THE PRODUCTION ON THE PERMITTING OF COURSE WERE WHILE STAYING. HOMELESS SERVICE WHO WAS SERVING. USES LIKE SHELTERS IN SUPPORT. OF WORKING WITH THE. ARE YOU DONE YES OKAY GREAT PROVIDE YOUR MICROPHONE WAS DOWN COMMITTEE FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND ALSO THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THE PANEL. SO SENATOR KABBADI HERO WAS GOING TO INTRODUCE THE PANEL- AND IF SHE IF IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. THIS COMMITTEE WILL BE. THIS PANEL WILL BE TALKING ABOUT- INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE SEEING FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF- DEVELOPERS AND ADVOCATES IN THIS SPACE AND WE HAVE THREE MEMBERS AND I'M SORRY WE HAVE THREE PANELISTS THAT WILL BE PRESENTING. AND I DON'T GOING TO BRING UP SHARON RAPPAPORT REPORT AND SILVER BURKE AND STEPHANIE DIETZ AND ARE YOU ALL QUEUED UP. AND YOU WOULD. UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES YOU WOULD NOT BE HEARING ME YOU WOULD BE HEARING SENATOR WIENER- AS CHAIR OF SENATOR HOUSE OF SENATE HOUSING MAKING THESE INTRODUCTIONS SO CENTER COMING YEAR WOULD YOU LIKE TO. BRIEFLY INTRODUCE OF THE SECOND PANEL. ABSOLUTELY MADAM CHAIR THE MINUTE I DECIDE TO GO TO THE RESTROOM THAT TIME READY TO MOVE ON HOW I. PRESHEAF THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO CONTINUE THIS HEARING. OF COURSE NOT ALL MY PAPERS ARE MESSED UP PANEL IS THE LOCAL EXPERIENCE WITH STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS AND OUR FIRST PRESENTER IS SHERIN REPORT. WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA STATE POLICY CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTED SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. THE MIKE IS YOURS. REPORTING FEATURES MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING AND INVITING ME TO SPEAK- MY NAME IS SHARON UPWARD OMINOUS CENTER CAPITO SAID I'M THE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA STATE POLICY FOR THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. C. S. H. IS A NATIONAL NONPROFIT AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WE WORK WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS TO IMPROVE RESPONSES THE HOMELESS. I'VE BEEN ASKED TO TALK TODAY ABOUT GAPS IN THE STATE'S RESPONSE. WHEN I CONSIDER WHERE THE STATE WAS IN TERMS OF FUNDING FOR HOUSING AND SERVICES JUST FIVE YEARS AGO I'M AMAZED AT THE PROGRESS THE STATE HAS A- LONG TERM VISION CAN NEXT WEEKEND REVERSING INCREASES IN HOMELESSNESS WHICH- AND DECADES IN THE MAKING. IF WE UNDERSTAND THE ROOT CAUSE OF HOMELESSNESS AND STRATEGICALLY- GAPS HOUSING SERVICES CAPACITY RESOURCE COORDINATION AND PREVENTION. MOST IMPORTANTLY WE NEED ONGOING FUNDING AT A SCALE TO MEET NEED AN ONGOING STATE COMMITMENT ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RECEIVING STATE MONEY LIKE THE HOMELESS HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND PREVENT. PROGRAMMER HAVE TO INVEST IN EVIDENCE BASED LONG TERM SOLUTIONS WHEN THEY KNOW DOLLARS WANT RIGHT NOW. WELL PROGRAMS LIKE HAVE HAVE BEEN CRITICAL RESOURCES FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES WITHOUT ON GOING SPENDING MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE USED HOW MANY ARE SHORT TERM INTERVENTIONS THAT MAY BE NEEDED LIKE SHELTER STAYS BUT THAT WON'T REGION'S THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCE CONCERNS. TO RESPOND TO SENATOR CRITICISES COMMENT. HOUSING ACTUALLY DOES FREE UP SHELTER SPACE IF WE HAVE MORE HOUSING OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE IN SHELTERS THEY ARE BETTER ABLE TO LEAVE RATHER THAN REMAINING IN THE SHELTER FROM NINE TO TWELVE MONTHS WHICH FORCES US TO CREATE MORE SHELTER BEDS MEET THAT NEED OF UNSTRUCTURED HOMES. ARE AMONGST US. IN FACT THE ONLY TIME I CAN. A STATE OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS MADE PROGRESS IN REDUCING PLANNED PROGRAMS OFFERING ONGOING AND- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR EXAMPLE REDUCED HOMELESSNESS AMONG VETERANS BY FORTY PERCENT. THROUGH ONGOING HOUSING SUBSIDIES PAIRED WITH BA SERVICES. BOTH MICHIGAN AND NEW JERSEY SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED HOMELESSNESS THEIR ONGOING FUNDING AS WELL. FILLING GAPS MEANS FIRST INVESTING IN HOUSING RESEARCH SHOWS THE COSTS OF HOMELESSNESS IS A LACK OF HOUSING HOUSEHOLDS WITH ACUTELY LOW INCOMES CAN'T AFFORD. FOR THIS REASON WE MUST INCREASES OF FIVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SPECIFICALLY FOR PEOPLE- AT GREATEST RISK AND EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS THE PRIVATE RENTAL MARKET NO LONGER MANAGES APARTMENTS- BETTER AFFORDABLE FOR INDIVIDUALS ON FIXED INCOMES AND FAMILIES WITH PARENTS MAKING MINIMUM WAGE. RAISING OUR STATE'S RENTAL HOUSING AND IS NOW THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR AT A SCALE WE HAD NEVER SEEN OR- WE HAVE MADE GAINS IN CREATING MORE HOUSING PARTICULARLY WITH INVESTMENTS AND HONG-JI AND STATE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDITS. AND PROGRAMS LIKE THE ACCELERATOR PROGRAM THAT SACCONE STATEMENT SHOULD BUT SOME OF OUR CAPITAL PROGRAMS LIKE THE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAM AND NO PLACE LIKE HOME ARE RUNNING OUT OF. WE CAN ALSO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS QUICKLY BY PAYING FOR HOUSING SUBSIDIES AND EXISTING HOUSING AND THE NONPROFIT AND PRIVATE MARKETS. THE FEDERAL SECTION EIGHT OR HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER PROGRAM IS AN- EXAMPLE OF THE PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN HUGELY SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING HOMELESSNESS. BAKERSFIELD IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO END CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS AND BAKERSFIELD THREE STRATEGIC INVESTMENT AND ONGOING FEDERAL HOUSING SUBSIDY IS. DEDICATED TO PEOPLE EXPERIENCING CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS. STATEWIDE A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR COULD HOUSE CLOSE TO FIFTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. THAT LAUNCHED THEM THE MOST- THAT HAVE I'M SORRY THE MOST RECENT ROUND OF HAVE PROVIDES INCENTIVES TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS JEANS HALF DOLLARS FOR HOUSING AND SETTING BENCHMARKS REDUCTIONS AND PERMITS. HOWEVER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE RELUCTANT TO COMMIT HOP FUNDING FOR SOMETHING LIKE HOUSING SUBSIDIES WHEN THEY MAY BE ON THE HOOK FOR FUNDING THOSE SUBSIDIES REHAB FUNDING RUNS OUT. ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY TWENTY HAVE RECORD ONLY USED FOR HOUSING SUBSIDIES WHERE IS 92% WAS. USED TO FIND SHELTERS- THAN ELEVEN PER SERVED EXIT HOME TO HOUSING NOT. ORDING TO THAT REPORT. THANK WE NEED TO CAPACITY AMONG OUR HOUSING AND HOMELESS SERVICES SECTORS WHICH OUT THE STATE'S WORK TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS HOUSING AND SERVICE PROVIDERS TYPICALLY RELY ON PAYMENT RATES THAT HAVE AN INCREASE FOR OVER TEN YEARS STAFFER BURDENED BY POOR PAY AND BURN OUT FOR TRIBULATIONS. THAT WAIT TILL THIS GAP WITH THE RELATIVELY MODEST INVESTMENT IN THE CAPACITY OF HOMELESS RESPONSE SECTOR. SOME JURISDICTIONS ARE USING HOW MANY PASSED LAST YEAR FOR THIS PURPOSE WHILE THEY'RE CREATING THEIR PLANS AND HEART ROWNTREE. INSIDE ONSTAD MENTIONS TECHNICAL TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS J. APPLY FOR FUNDING WHICH HAS BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. I HAVE SUPPLEMENT THOUGH COULD ENSURE NONPROFIT PROVIDERS ARE PREPARED TO IMPLEMENT THE INCREASE STATE FUNDING SUCCESSFULLY ON AN ONGOING BASIS. COLLUDING FOR HIRING AND RETAINING STAFF. THIRD A LACK OF ADEQUATE SERVICES FUNDING REMAINS ONE OF THE BIGGEST BARRIERS FOR PEOPLE TO ACCESS HOUSING TO ASSESS INDIVIDUAL NEEDS AND FOR SOME TERM MAINSTAY OF GREENHOUSE. BLACK OF SERVICES FUNDING HAS CONTRIBUTED TO PEOPLE LEAVING PROJECT ROOM KEY INSIGHTS KNOW WHERE TO GO. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES CALTRAIN REFORMS TO MEDICARE ALL PROMISES TO FIND SOME SERVICES BUT ONLY FOR A FRACTION OF CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED. MOST MANAGED CARE PLANS CARRYING OUT CAL AIMED FUNDING THESE SERVICES REPORT THEY'LL PAY FOR SERVICES FOR ONLY SHORT PERIODS AND FOR ONLY AS LONG AS THEY CAN DEMONSTRATE RETURN ON INVESTMENT. WE COULD FOLLOW THE LEAD OF OTHER STATES AND CREATE A MEDIC CAL HOUSING SUPPORT SERVICES BENEFIT. MAKING SERVICES AVAILABLE TO ALMOST ALL NEEDING AND WANTING SERVICES AND TAPPING INTO 5290% FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR THOSE. FOR US TO MAKE THIS ALL WORK AT THE SYSTEMS LEVEL. AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS COULD WORK MORE COLLABORATIVELY COLLABORATIVELY AS YOU MENTIONED SENATOR CONQUER. CHILI LOHAN'S ACT ONSTAD TALKED ABOUT ADVANCES IN COLLABORATION AND COORDINATION AND THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES IN HOUSING AGENCY PRIMARILY THROUGH- THE CALIFORNIA INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS DRAFTED A VERY THOUGHTFUL STATE ACTION PLAN. THE NEXT STEP SHOULD INCLUDE A FORMAL PROCESS FOR STAFF WORKING ACROSS DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES REGULARLY TO COURTNEY- THIS PROCESS WE CAN SECURE PHILANTHROPIC FUNDING FOR INNOVATIONS. WE CAN ACCESS PROGRAMMATIC OUTCOMES AND JUST AGGREGATE DATA BY RACE TO DETERMINE WHO BENEFITS FROM STATE PROGRAMS. WE CAN MAKE IT EASIER FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NGOS FIVE FOR FUNDING BIGELOW STABBER STANDARDS THAT RECOGNIZED EVIDENCE OF SUCCESSFUL MODELS OF HOUSING AND SERVICES. AND WE COULD AVOID DUPLICATING STAFF WORK MAKING RESOURCES MORE ACTIVE. FINALLY BEFORE LEGISLATORS CAN REASONABLY EXPECT DECREASES IN HOMELESS NUMBERS WE MUST STOP THE INFLOW. THE LOS ANGELES HOMELESS RESPONSE REPORTED THAT EIGHTY THREE THOUSAND MORE PEOPLE BECAME HOMELESS AND TWENTY TWENTY THEN IN TWENTY NINETEEN. SO EVEN THOUGH THE HOUSE MORE THAN DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN TWENTY TWENTY THAN THEY HAD FIVE YEARS BEFORE THANKS IN LARGE PART DUE TO STATE FUNDING. THEY WERE OVERWHELMED WITH PEOPLE FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS AND THAT IS TRUE FOR MOST OF OUR LOCALS. FOR ANY PREVENTION PROGRAM THE STATE SHOULD INCORPORATE THE CALIFORNIA POLICY LABS RISK IDENTIFIERS TO TARGET PREVENTION RESOURCES TO THOSE MOST LIKELY TO BECOME. AND NOT A GREAT BROAD EVICTION PREVENTION WITH HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION. I KEEP PREVENTION STRATEGY IS ALSO DISTURBING DISCHARGES FROM OUR INSTITUTION INTO HOMELESSNESS CDCR STAFF REPORT THAT BETWEEN WILL BECOME HOMELESS PEOPLE LIVING IN FOSTER CARE ARE FIVE TIMES GREATER RISK OF CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS- THEN THE GENERAL PUBLIC. AND OVER ELEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE IN OUR NURSING HOMES HAVE NOWHERE TO GO WHEN DISCHARGED. THESE SETTINGS ARE NOT ONLY DRIVERS OF HOMELESSNESS THEY CONTRIBUTE CONTRIBUTE TO DISPROPORTIONATE RATES OF HOMELESSNESS AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS AND INDIGENOUS PEOPLE MEDICAID INNOVATIONS THAT PROMISE SOME REDUCTION IN INSTEAD. SURE INCLUDING AMONG PEOPLE WHO WERE- EXITING JAILS AND VICTOR DERON SPOKE AT C. B. C. S. H. INVESTMENT IN YOUTH EXPERIENCE. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE PROMISING BEGINNINGS BUT OUR INSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM SHOULD NEXT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAKING SURE PEOPLE DOES CHARGING WITH NO PLACE TO GO OUT SOMEWHERE TO LIVE THAT DOES NOT LIMIT THE LENGTH OF STAY AND IF NEEDED RECEIVE SERVICES PROMOTING TRAUMA INFORMED EVERY. PLENTY OF DATA SHOWS HOUSING WITH SERVICES IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AND FAR LESS EXPENSIVE THAN PAYING FOR A RETURN TO AN INSTITUTION. TELLING THESE FIVE GAPS WITHIN WITH THE POLITICAL WILL TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE PROGRESS MADE SO FAR. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. CAN WE HAVE A MICROPHONE FOR CENTER COVER YOUR. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IT'S- REALLY HELPFUL AND I APPRECIATE IT WE'RE GONNA GET WAIT TO THE VERY END TO TAKE QUESTIONS AND SO WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON. TO END SILVERBERG WHO IS THE CEO OF NOR CAL. DIVISIONS RELATED CALIFORNIA. MY KISS YOURS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ON A ROLL MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES- I AS WAS JUST STATED THAT MY NAME IS DAN SILVA BURKE AND I'M THE CEO CARL RELATED NORTHERN CALIFORNIA NORTHWEST AFFORDABLE DIVISIONS- IN MY ROLE I'M CURRENTLY OVERSEEN THE CREATION OF ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND OUR ORGANIZATION IN ITS THIRTY YEAR HISTORY AS THE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING OVER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND- UNITS IN THE STATE- FIRST AND FOREMOST I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS MY GRIEF GRATITUDE TO THE LAWMAKERS AND STAFF MEMBERS. OF BOTH OF THE COMMITTEES FOR YOUR CLEAR COMMITMENT TO COMBATING ARE SEVERE HOUSING CRISIS- THE LAWS AND THE POLICIES THAT YOU WORKED TIRELESSLY TO DESIGN THE PAST TO IMPLEMENT EEN CRITICAL ABILITY TO ADDRESS THE INTERCONNECTED CHALLENGES OF ALL HOUSING AND CLIMATE RESILIENCY IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE STARTING TO SEE IT'S REALLY MAKING A DIFFERENCE- TOGETHER WE FACE AN ENORMOUS TASK- TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING. NEAR BASIC AND FUNDAMENTAL SERVICES EUROPE PLAMEN OPPORTUNITIES HIGH QUALITY TRANSIT- AND IT'S A CHALLENGE WHILE WE'RE ALSO INTERESTING ADDRESSING THE SYSTEMIC CAUSES OF RAPIDLY CHANGING CLIMATE- WITHOUT POLICIES LIKE SB THIRTY FIVE AND FUNDING PROGRAMS SUCH AS A SAKE I A I G. M. H. P. OUR WORK IS DEVELOPERS ARE PRACTITIONERS TODAY WOULD BE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE THESE ARE EXAMPLES NOT JUST A PROMISING POLICY IDEAS BUT A WELL DESIGNED INTENTIONAL BONTA- TOOLS THAT WE ARE USING AND CONSISTENTLY RELY ON TODAY TO CREATE AFFORDABLE HOMES FOR CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF THESE TOOLS IN PRACTICE- AND THEN- HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF CHALLENGES AS WELL SO MY FIRST EXAMPLE. IS OUR SUGAR PINE VILLAGE DEVELOPMENT IN IN THE CITY OF SOUTH LAKE TAHOE- WE WERE ABLE TO USE. THIRTY FIVE TO FULLY ENTITLED TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY EIGHT AFFORDABLE WORKFORCE HOUSING UNITS IN LESS THAN SIX MONTHS THIS IS THE LARGEST HOUSING- A HOUSING PROJECT APPROVED IN THE CITY'S HISTORY. AND WILL- OF COURSE MY DOGS WALKING AND IN THIS MOMENT I WILL GO A LONG WAY TO ADDRESS THE PRESSING NEED FOR NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THIS COMMUNITY- IT'S BEEN PARTICULARLY HARD HIT IS COBIT NINETEEN HAS CAUSED. EVEN MORE SHORTAGES AS PEOPLE ARE MOVING INTO THE AREA BECAUSE OF CURRENT- SUGAR PINE VILLAGE NOT ONLY BENEFITED FROM SB THIRTY FIVE IN THE STREAMLINING IT ALSO HAS BEEN A BENEFICIARY OF CRITICAL FUNDING SUPPORT. FUND SOME OF THE FUNDING PROGRAMS THAT I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED INCLUDING PROPOSITION ONE AND H. P. PROGRAM I G. SB TWO PLH A PROGRAM AS WELL AS STATE HOUSING TAX CREDITS. THESE FUNDING PROGRAMS ALL WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS PROJECT AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN DELIVER THESE AFFORDABLE UNITS IN THE COMMUNITY. MANY GIVE YOU A SECOND EXAMPLE OF A PROJECT THAT IS UTILIZING THE TOOLS BUT IS CHALLENGES I MENTION. ON THIS PROJECT IS ONE THAT WE'RE WORKING ON WITH MERCY HOUSING IN SAN FRANCISCO IT'S A REVITALIZATION OF THIS ANY JAIL PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECT IT'S A VERY VERY LARGE FIFTY ACRE LONG TERM UNDERTAKING THAT AIMS TO WRITE MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS OF DISINVESTMENT IN PUBLIC HOUSING. AND WE'RE LOOKING TO CREATE A DYNAMIC FLOURISHING AMENITY RICH COMMUNITY FOR THE STUDY DALE RESIDENTS NEEDLESS TO SAY THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY HIGH PRIORITY FOR US AS AN ORGANIZATION FOR THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND FOR THE RESIDENTS. AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER TO SECURE THE FINANCING THAT'S NEEDED TO MOVE VARIOUS PHASES OF THIS PROJECT BOARD INCLUDING A RECENTLY AWARDED I. I. G. AND EASY FUNDING FROM EACH CD- I'M FOR THE ONLY. THE PRICE IS FOR. A THAT IS NOT UNIQUE TO THIS PROJECT BUT MANY OTHER PROJECTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH ALREADY HAS BEEN REFERENCED TODAY IN THIS DISCUSSION. AND THAT'S THE CONTINUED BACKLOG OF LIMITED FEDERAL TAX EXEMPT BONDS AUTHORITY WITHOUT THAT AUTHORITY THIS PROJECT FUTURE PHASES IS STALLED AND CANNOT MOVE FORWARD DESPITE FULL FINANCING- THE INTRODUCED LAST YEAR IS A NATURAL FIT FOR THIS PROJECT- BUT BECAUSE THE DOLLARS ARE LIMITED IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT SUNNYDALE OR OTHER PROJECTS LIKE THIS WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE FUNDS- THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF THE ACCELERATOR PROGRAM. ACCELERATOR FINDS A PROVEN TO BE A CLEAR SOLUTION TO THE STATE'S LIMITED BOND AUTHORITY AND WE- ENCOURAGE YOU AS YOU ARE CONSIDERING ALL OF YOUR VARIOUS APPROACHES THAT YOU CONSIDER ONGOING SUPPORT FOR THE XCELERATED PROGRAM- THAT WAY PROJECTS LIKE SUNNYDALE AND MANY OTHERS THAT ARE STALLED WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. THE ACCELERATOR IS THE ONE A SOURCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TODAY THAT REALLY INCREASES THE SIZE OF THE PIE REALLY ALLOWS US. TO DELIVER MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE POSSIBLE GIVEN THE LIMITATIONS OF THE FEDERAL TAX EXEMPT BONDS- IN ADDITION TO ACCELERATOR I'D LIKE TO JUST- ENCOURAGE ONE OTHER THING FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. WHICH IS THE FACT THAT PROP ONE APPROVED FUNDING- IS RUNNING OUT SO VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS LIKE NO PLACE LIKE HOME LIKE MHP ARE RUNNING OUT YEAH AND NOT ONLY ARE THOSE IMPORTANT FOR IT THAT FINANCING OF OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS. THE CONSISTENT PREDICTABILITY OF THOSE FUNDING SOURCES IS CRITICAL FOR OUR PLANNING FOR THE EFFICIENT DELIVERY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE STATE. SO AGAIN AND WE REALLY REALLY APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP OF OUR LAWMAKERS THE GOVERNOR- AND ALL OF US AS WORK CONSIDERING HOW WE ATTACKED THIS. LARGE IN THIS OF CALIFORNIA WE REALLY ENCOURAGE THE ONGOING SUPPORT OF INVALUABLE PROGRAMS LIKE AYE AYE G. A. SIX C. HOUSING CREDITS AS WELL AS THE ACCELERATOR PROGRAM AND THOSE FUNDING PROGRAMS THAT WERE FIRST APPROVED BY VOTERS WITH PROP ONE. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR VISION AND SUPPORT AND FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR YOUR TESTIMONY- REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND- BY THE LAST MEMBER OF OUR PANEL IS STEPHANIE D. TO THE CITY MANAGER FOR MY OWN CITY OF MERCED. FORGERS THANK YOU SENATOR CAVIAR FOR THAT KIND INTRODUCTION AND A GOOD MORNING TO ALL OF OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND ARE CO CHAIRS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A LOCAL EXPERIENCE TODAY AND I'M HONORED TO REPRESENT NOT ONLY THE CITY OF MERCED AS WE TALK ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT ALSO TO REPRESENT- TWELVE DIFFERENT LOCAL PARTNER AGENCIES IN OUR COLLECTIVE APPROACH IN RE DESIGNING AND RE IMAGINING HOW WE NEED TO THE NEEDS OF THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS LIVING ON THE STREETS OF MERCED COUNTY- BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY HOW TO VISION. OF BRINGING LOCAL LEADERS TOGETHER TO REIMAGINE THE WAY WE PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND HE CHALLENGED US TO REALLY TAKE A STRONG LOOK AT WHAT WE WHAT WE WERE DOING IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND HOW WE COULD DO THAT MORE EFFICIENTLY AND MORE COLLABORATIVELY AS A COLLECTIVE PARTNERS AND SO WITH THAT CHALLENGE HE ALSO WAS ABLE TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU AS LEGISLATURES IN COMING UP WITH ONE TIME FINDING A SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO INVEST IN THE ONE TIME CONSTRUCTION OF CAPACITY AND THAT WAS THEIR SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOUSING OPTIONS IT WAS THROUGH A NAVIGATION CENTER AND SHELTER BEDS. IT WAS THE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND ALSO CHALLENGE US TO START LOOKING INTO THE CONSTRUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE TOOK A HOUSING FIRST APPROACH MODEL WE AT BOLSTERED OUR OUTREACH ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS WE BUILD OTHER SUPPORT OF NETWORKS AROUND ARE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS INCLUDING OUT- IMPLEMENTING A LOCAL HOMELESS COURT PARTNERING WITH CALTRANS TO ADDRESS THEIR RIGHTS OF WAY IN AND AROUND OUR COMMUNITIES THEIR DELEGATED MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS ESTABLISHED HOUSING- TRAINING PROGRAMS WITH LOCAL NONPROFITS AND THEN WE WERE SUCCESSFUL. IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND BEING AWARDED THIRTEEN POINT NINE MILLION IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES GRANT WHICH IT REALLY INTRODUCED THE FIRST THIRTY UNITS OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITY. AND I CAN HONESTLY TELL YOU OVER LAST FIVE BEING TRICKLED OF THIS. WE'VE SEEN OUR HOUSE ARE UNSHELTERED NUMBERS GO FROM FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AT THAT POINT IN TIME COUNT. TO THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR COUNTY WIDE WHICH IS A 29% DECREASE AND JUST IN THE CITY OF OUR SIDE WE HAD TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR UNSHELTERED LIVING ON OUR STREETS. LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR WE'RE AT A HUNDRED AND NINETY WHICH IS A 15% DECREASE. SO COLLECTIVELY AND OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD WE'VE REIMAGINE OUR SERVICES WITH THE CREATING CAPACITY FOR ALL TYPES OF BALANCE. AND TO MEET THE NEEDS pSTARTING TO SEE SUCCESS AND THROUGH THIS PARTNERSHIP WE ESTIMATED AT. HOME HE HAD NO PLACE LIKE HOME APPLICATIONS FOR OVER A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE BEDS AND NOT WILL TARGET I'M JUST IN THE CITY MERCED THAT'LL TARGET THE REMAINING INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. EIGHT I DO WANT TO SHIFT INTO THE HOUSING CONVERSATION BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S- EXTREMELY RELEVANT TO DISCUSS HOW EXPEDITING THE PATH TO ENTITLEMENT. IS REALLY THE KEY TO UNLOCKING THAT CALIFORNIA'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING POTENTIAL. LAST YEAR TE CITY COUNCIL SPEND AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF TIME DECONSTRUCTING ITS GENERAL PLAN. IN ALLIANCE WITH A LOT OF THE POLICIES THAT YOU AT THE STATE HAVE ADOPTED RECOMMENDED TO THE GOVERNOR AND HE APPROVED. TO ENSURE THAT WE WERE MEETING THE LOCAL BEACH HERE AND NOT CREATING ANY UNDUE BARRIERS TO ENTITLEMENT. AND REALLY THROUGH THAT PROCESS LOCALLY WE ADOPTED THIS MOTTO. HOUSING DELAYED IS HOUSING DENIED. OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE'VE SEEN THE CONSTRUCTION UP TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED UNITS IN THE CITY OF MERCED. THE TEN YEARS PRIOR TO THAT WE BUILT ON THE TWO HUNDRED FAMILY SINGLE FAMILY AND MULTI FAMILY UNITS COMBINED. SO WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOUSING OF ALL TYPES AND THERE REALLY IS NO WAY OF RUNNING SOLUTION TO THE HOUSING CRISIS AND HERE IN THE CITY OF RIVERSIDE WE'VE. EMBRACED ALL OF THESE POLICY- OPTIONS IN LOOKING REDUCE OUR TO PLAN TO INCLUDE ALL OF THE ELEMENTS. WE'RE COMMUNITY THAT THE GREAT RECESSION SOL PROBLEMS THE LEAST AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS ANY OTHER COMMUNITY IN CALIFORNIA. AND NOW WE'VE SEEN THE CONSTRUCTION OF UNITS INCREASED BY A THOUSAND FOLD. AND FOR US HERE WE UNDERSTAND THAT. IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET TO ENTITLEMENT IN IN A TRADITIONAL FASHION. THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES PROJECT WAS A HUNDRED IN NINETEEN UNIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH THIRTY AND- THIRTY OF THOSE UNITS OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE AND IT TOOK US FIVE YEARS. TO GET TO BE ABLE TO MAKE APPLICATION. DOES THREE BUT YOU HOME KEY AND ONE NO PLACE LIKE HOME THANKS TO SOME OF THE POLICIES AND INCLUDING SB THIRTY FIVE. THAT WERE ADOPTED LAST SUMMER THAT TOOK US LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS. THAT TRULY IS THE KEY FROM A LOCAL JURISDICTION PERSPECTIVE IN UNLOCKING THE POTENTIAL TO BUILD HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AT ALL LEVELS AND ANY HOUSING THAT WE CAN OFFER INTO OUR COMMUNITY ALL HOUSING TYPES ARE NEEDED. WITHIN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR MONTHS WE'VE REACHED A POINT IN OUR COMMUNITY WHERE THERE WERE ONLY FORTY UNITS AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET. WE NEED ANY AND ALL AND THERE IS NO WRONG SOLUTION FOR US. IN LOOKING AT OUR RESPONSIBILITIES AND REDESIGNING OUR GENERALPLAN WE'RE ALSO OFFERING ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT PLANS THAT ARE SHOVEL READY READY TO GO TAKE THEM THEY'RE ALREADY PRE APPROVED. YOU CAN START ACTION IF YOU COME IN AND USE OUR PLANTS. WE'VE ADOPTED OF THE RESIDENTIAL DENSITY AND WE'RE INTEGRATING THAT IN OUR REDESIGN OF THE GENERAL PLAN ALONG WITH STREAMLINING ENTITLEMENT PROCESS THESE. LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE HISTORICALLY PUT THINGS IN- THAT CREATE CONFLICT YOU'RE NOT WRONG IN THOSE STATEMENTS. AND SO WE'RE WE'RE UNPACKING THOSE AND WE'RE SEEING HOW WE CAN MAKE THOSE MORE EFFICIENT. SOME THINGS ARE DOING LOCALLY OR ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR INTERFACE EVALUATION AND CREATING STANDARD CONDITIONS. OF APPROVAL. WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT HOW CAN WE BE MARK FLEX. AFFORDABLE BY THE- OUR GENERAL RESTORE THE SIZE OF SINGLE LOTS. AND YOU CAN'T BUILD SMALLER WE NEED TO BE GOOD PARTNERS IN THIS CONVERSATION AND RETAIN REDUCE THOSE RESTRICTIONS WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE DENSER DEVELOPMENT. BUILDING THAT MORE CLOSELY TOGETHER AND AT HIGHER LEVELS. HISTORICALLY CENTRAL VALLEY COMMUNITIES DON'T LIKE TO SEE THOSE TYPES OF DENSE DEVELOPMENTS AND IT'S TIME THAT WE ENTER INTO THIS SPACE. IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THAT WE SAT DOWN WITH OUR BUILDING COMMUNITY BECAUSE AS HAS BEEN STATED BEFORE THE CITY'S DON'T CONSTRUCT HOUSING WE WORK WITH. DEVELOPER PARTNERS IN ORDER TO BUILD A WE ASK DARKEN OUR CONTRACTORS IN OUR DEVELOPERS WHAT ARE WE DOING RIGHT. AND WHAT ARE WE DOING WRONG AND OUT OF THAT CAME A LIST OF OTHER SUGGESTIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTING AND WE DO THAT RECALL THAT CONVERSATION ANNUALLY. SO WE'RE NOT JUST MEETING WITH OUR HOMELESS ADVOCATES AND INDIVIDUALS THAT USE OUR SERVICES WERE ALSO MEETING WITH THE INDIVIDUALS WHO BUILD HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AREN'T THE ISSUE. AND WE'RE NOT STANDING IN THE WAY. ON THE FOREFRONT OF. WHAT'S COMING N THE CITY OF OUR SIZE OUR CITY COUNCIL HAS MET. THAT COMMITMENT A POLICY CHANGE WITH FUNDING MUCH LIKE YOUR DOING IT CONSIDERING TO ADD TODAY IN YOUR DIALOGUE. BY TAKING THEIR ANNUAL ALLOCATION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUBSIDIES FROM THREE MILLION TO FIFTEEN MILLION ANSWER AS A RESULT OF THE ARK OF FUNDING WE RECEIVED HERE OCALLY. AND THEY'RE IN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING ANNEXATIONS OF YOU SEE MORE SAD. AND THEY TO. CONTINUE ITS PROPERTIES AS A RESULT OF THE APPROVAL OF AB THREE THREE ONE TWO TO ANNEX I THOUSAND MORE ACRES RESULTING IN EIGHT THOUSAND MORE UNITS THAT WILL BE. PRINCIPALLY PERMITTED AS THEY COME IN TO THE CITY THROUGH ANNEXATION. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS VERY- THIS THIS IS A COMPLEX ISSUE DEALING WITH A COMPLEX SYSTEM. AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO BREAK DOWN THE SILOS AND TO BUILD PARTNERSHIPS LOCALLY. I CAN ALSO TELL YOU THAT THE BEST APPROACH FOR US HAS BEEN LOOKING WITHIN. OUR COMMUNITY AT A REGIONAL LEVEL. I DON'T HAVE SO SIR. TO A TO MY- INTO TO THE PARKING. LIVING ON THE STREET MY K. IN MY O. C. HAVE THEM SIR. WITH THAT PARTNERS I CAN'T MEET THE NEEDS TO WRAP AROUND INDIVIDUALS. SIMPLY PUTTING THEM IN THE HOLE IN A HOME WITHOUT SUPPORTIVE SERVICES IT SETTING SOMEONE UP. TO FAIL AND SO WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER IN DOING SO AT A REGIONAL LEVEL. WE'RE TAKING THAT NEXT STEP IN EVALUATING ARENA. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES IN POLICY WE'RE BUILDING OUR FIRST MULTI JURISDICTIONAL RINA IN HOUSING ELEMENTS THAT WERE WORKING ON TOGETHER. AND NOT NEXT STOP WILL TRANSITION INTO A REGIONAL HOUSING TRUST. I'M THE ONLY ENTITLEMENT CITY WITHIN MY COUNTY. MY FELLOW CITIES AND THE UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITY NEED TO GET THEIR HANDS ON THESE TYPES OF RESOURCES SO WE'RE COMING TOGETHER COLLECTIVELY. INCREASED OUR LOCAL CAPACITY AND THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE. ALMOST IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I'LL STOP THERE AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS WHEN THE TIME IS APPROPRIATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH M. IT EXCELLENT PRESENTATION APPRECIATE- YOU'RE PARTICIPATING HERE TODAY- LET ME JUST START OFF BY SEN I BY SAYING THAT- ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT HAS. COME UP OVER AND OVER FOR ME AND NOW MY DISTRICT IS I HAVE A NUMBER OF SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES WHO ARE DESPERATE TO BUILD HOUSING THERE. AREN'T READY TO DO IT BECAUSE- THE RETAIL. STORES AND PHARMACIES LOOK TO HELP WHAT'S THE POPULATION BASE IN ORDER TO COME INTO A COMMUNITY IN THE WAY THAT THEY BUILD ECONOMICALLY IS TO BUILD A HOUSING WHICH WILL THEN BRING THE RETAIL AND- AND THE PHARMACIES- SO THE PROGRAMS THAT DO NOT WORK WITH SMALL RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE OF CONCERN TO ME AND IN PARTICULAR- IT'S A IT'S BEEN NEED THE I. G. IN THIS. THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY PROGRAM SO I'M REALLY HERE GLAD TO HEAR THAT MERCED BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE RESOURCES I KNOW THERE IS A SET ASIDE FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES WE MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT THAT AND INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THE COMMUNITIES REALLY THAT ARE READY TO BUILD A HOUSING HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO DO THAT- SO I'M I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR YOU WERE ABLE TO ACCESS SOME OF THOSE FUNDS- MY- THOSE THAT THOSE ARE JUST STATEMENTS MY FIRST COURT MIKE MY QUESTION IS ON. THE- WHAT WHAT KIND OF INVESTMENTS SHOULD THE SENATE BE CONSIDERING IN ORDER TO BUILD. UPON RECENT INVESTMENTS TO AND THEN PREVENT HOMELESSNESS AND TO PROVIDE MORE CERTAINTY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS SO WE KNOW WE NEED TO BUILD. HOUSING THAT IS AFFORDABLE. AS WELL AS DEAL WITH THE HOMELESS POPULATION. BUT WHAT WHAT SHOULD WE BE FOCUSING ON IN TERMS OF THE OUR FUNDS AND I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES IS DO WE START SOMETHING NEW OR DO WE GO BACK AND- MAKE SURE THAT THE RESOURCES THAT WE PUT OUT THERE. THAT THERE'S RESOURCES THAT ARE CONTINUING. TO FOLLOW IN THOSE IN THOSE CATEGORIES SO YOU HAVEN'T- ANYONE ANYONE ON THE PANEL THAT CAN ANSWER THAT. WHY DON'T I START AND THEN MAYBE OTHERS CAN JOIN IN. I WOULD- THERE ARE A MYRIAD OF FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AND WHAT I WOULD STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER AS YOU DELIBERATE THIS YEAR'S BUDGET IS. AN ON GOING SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND THEN CONTINUE TO INVEST IN FUNDING THAT HELPS- MATCHED OUR LOCAL FUNDS TO OFFSET THE COST OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THOSE ARE THE TWO AREAS. AND YOU CAN DO THAT BY FUNDING- CREATING THESE ONE TIME POTS OF MONEY EITHER THROUGH KEEP SASH OR READ AS AN ONGOING ALLOCATION THROUGH THE COCS AND COUNTIES. OR YOU YOU CAN REIMAGINE AND DIED BUT I WILL JUST GO SOME OF WHAT THE OTHER TWO SPEAKERS BEFORE ME AND SAID. WE NEED TO TRANSITION OUT OF ONE TIME FUNDING INTO SUSTAINABLE FUNDING WE'RE CREATING THE SYSTEMS OF CARE AND WITH THE ONE TIME INVESTMENT THAT WE RECEIVED WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY A MILLION DOLLARS LEFT WHICH MEANS IN A YEAR. AND A YEAR TO TWO YEARS WILL RUN OUT OF MONEY TO SUPPORT THESE HUNDRED A HUNDRED AND NINETY BED SET UP IN CREATED IN OUR COUNTY. WE'RE REALLY STRUGGLING WITH SUSTAINABILITY BECAUSE A LOT OF THE FUNDS WERE USING LOCALLY ARE ONE TIME. ON THE CONSTRUCTION SIDE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING ONE TIME FUNDING WORKS WELL ONCE WE GET THINGS UP AND MOVING WE CAN FIGURE OUT THE SUSTAINABILITY. OF THOSE PROJECTS THAT'S WHAT THE LOCALS HAVE- THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO UNLOCK THE POTENTIAL OF WITH A DOCTOR TO FEE REDUCTION PROGRAM. THAT WAS JUST DONE LAST MONTH SO WE'RE WE'RE GOING INTO THE ABILITY OF BEING MORE ADVANTAGEOUS WITH ONE TIME FUNDING BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE- SERVICES AND HOUSING. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE REALLY. NEED TO FOCUS TO STAND ABILITY EFFORTS ON. VERY GOOD- I CONDITION IN AS I'D THINK THAT IN TERMS OF- BIG BANG FOR BACK HOUSING SUBSIDIES IS A REALLY GOOD WAY TO GO TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM BECOMING HOMELESS AND REALLY TARGETING THOSE SUBSIDIES. THE PEOPLE MOST LIKELY TO BECOME HOMELESS- AT ASSEMBLY MEMBER SYRIAN IS GOING TO BE INTRODUCING A BILL THAT WILL. OFFER PREVENTION RESOURCES TO OLDER ADULTS WHO ARE AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS. AND WE HAVE SEEN STUDIES AT OF SAN DIEGO THAT. SOME OLDER ADULTS JUST NEED TWO OR THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. TO MAINTAIN THEIR HOUSING THAT WITHOUT THAT FUNDING WITHOUT THAT MONEY THAT YOU KNOW AT TWO THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH THEY ME. THEY ARE LIKELY TO BECOME HOMELESS AND SO. I DO THINK THAT IS ONE PIECE TO KEEP IN MIND AND TO. TO TO FIND I DO THINK THAT THAT PROBABLY DOES REQUIRE A NEW PROGRAM- JUST BECAUSE- NONE OF OUR EXISTING PROGRAMS REALLY LOOK AT. PREVENTION AND REALLY FOCUS RESOURCES ON PREVENTION- I'M IN A TARGETED WAY- BUT I DO AGREE COMPLETELY WITH STEPHANIE THE OTHER- THE OTHER PIECES THAT SHE MENTIONED I THINK ARE ALSO CREDIT. THE KEEPING. IN MIND WHEN IT COMES TO PREVENTION. IF I AM I ADD A THOUGHT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE OF THAT FOR MANY. ONGOING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE DELIVERY OF THAT HOUSING I YOU KNOW THERE THERE'S THERE. IS I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THE IMPORTANCE OF A STABLE ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDS THAT STREET FOR OPERATING SUBSIDY AND SERVICE DOLLARS BUT IT IS TRUE FOR THE CAPITAL PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE USING TO DELIVER THE HOUSING BECAUSE- THE FEAST OR FAMINE OR THE NEW PROGRAM AND JUST STATE THAT BROKE. THAT DEVELOPMENTS TAKE A VERY VERY LONG TIME THEY GET STRUCTURED AND THEN IF THERE'S A CHANGE THAT AND IT'S VERY INEFFICIENT AS THEY SIT AND WAIT OR THEY ARE RESTRUCTURED SO. HAVING PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDED ON A CONSISTENT ONGOING BASIS IS REALLY REALLY HELPFUL WILL TAKE WILL TAKE ALL SOLUTIONS ALSO LESIONS ARE WELCOME OF COURSE BUT THESE PROGRAMS THAT ARE ABOUT TO EXPIRE OR THESE PROGRAMS THAT ONE TIME ONLY IF THEY CAN BE RENEWED I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY VERY HELPFUL FOR THAT. FOR THE INDUSTRY DELIVERING THE HOUSING. WHAT YOU FOR THAT AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS BECAUSE WHEN WE- WHEN WE ESTABLISHED A NEW FUND. THEN THE PARAMETERS OF THE FUND HAVE TO BE DEVELOPED AND THAT TAKES TIME. AND IT MEANS EVERYBODY'S GOT A SHIFT AND- I'M- PART OF WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS I'VE HEARD OVER THE YEARS THAT THE I. G. IN THIS AND THE- AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY PROGRAM DOESN'T WORK REALLY WELL AND RURAL CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE'VE DONE. SOME SET ASIDE OR A SPECIAL CRITERIA FOR THE FOR RURAL COMMUNITIES BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE FUNDS I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. IN AREAS WHERE YOU CAN SEE YOU CAN STILL. BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING PERMANENT HOUSING THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR THAT ABOUT TO BE ABLE TO HAPPEN. SO I'M DONE WITH MY QUESTIONS- MADAM CHAIR I BELIEVE- MIGHT CARE OF HOUSING. I MAY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AND THEN I'LL JUST TURN IT OVER TO YOU TO BE ABLE TO CALL ON PEOPLE SINCE YOU HAVE A BETTER VIEW OF THAT OF THAT ROOM. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS TODAY. THANK YOU BYE. VENTURE ON. THAT'S THE THANK YOU FOR REALLY STRONG PRESENTATIONS I'M JUST A QUICK QUESTION FOR MISSISSAUGA BURGER- AND THANK YOU FOR TALKING ABOUT- THE IMPACT OF. THIRTY FIVE IN GETTING OUT SIGNIFICANT REALLY STRONG PLUS EXTRAORDINARY THAT- GREAT WHAT'S A NEW TITLE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF A LARGE GROUP HOUSING PROJECT IN A COMMUNITY THAT THERE WASN'T A LOT OF THAT KIND OF HOUSING HAPPENING. UNLESS I'VE BEEN SOMEWHAT SOME SIX MONTHS BUT JUST OVERALL- SO SHOULD I WAS HOMELESSNESS MONTH. I KNOW YOU CAN PREDICT AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE HOW LONG DOES WOULD SIT DOWN UP SOME. LIVE STREAM- BUT BASS ON YOUR EX. BUT HOW LONG WOULD KIND OF PROBLEM WITH YOUR EXPECTED THAT KIND OF PROJECT TO TAKE HIM TO GET. IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION WE'RE SEEING TIME IN AGAIN THAT THAT TIME TO ENTITLE USING SB THIRTY FIVE AS A MATTER OF MONTHS INSTEAD OF YEARS AS YOU AS YOU NOTED EARLIER- I CAN'T TELL YOU WITH PRECISION WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF WE HAD PRECEDED THE TRADITIONAL PATH BUT I CAN SAY THAT WE WERE ENTITLING ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT AROUND THE SAME TIME. USING A TRADITIONAL PATH SB THIRTY FIVE WASN'T AN OPTION IN THAT CAS AND IT TOOK A YEAR AND A HALF IT WAS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE IT TOOK MUCH MORE TIME AND I WOULD EXPECT THAT SOMETHING. ALONG THOSE LINES WOULD BE THE CASE HERE AND PERHAPS EVEN LONGER GIVE AND YOU KNOW THAT THE COMMUNITY THE COMPLEXITY OF THAT DEVELOPMENT YEAH. BASED ON WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM. RIGHT ELDERS. YOU'RE IN A HOUSE WOULD HAVE BEEN. I THAT'S TERRIFIC BUT YOU WERE WHAT'S INSIDE ALL. ACROSS OF THE YEAR AND A HALF FROM- I THINK IT I'M HAPPEN BUT I'LL- NOT SOME. AND WE- ARE ONE- ANOTHER PORTABLE HOUSING- PROBABLY BUILDERS. FOR ME THAT THEIR AVERAGE APPROVAL TIME CONGRESS TWO THIRTY ONE SO YEAR FOUR MONTHS. BECAUSE THERE ARE PRICE THAT JUST. UNBELIEVABLE ON TIME. SO SINCE THANK YOU. IS ARE YOU GOOD WE I'M GOOD RUNS OKAY GREAT SO NOW WILL QUESTIONS FROM CENTER CORTE. THANK YOU MANAGE YOUR IN IN A JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY- MS A RAP PURPOSE PART OF HOUSING IN PREVENTIVE MEASURES AS THE PRIMARY MEANS TO- YOU KNOW CLEARING- THIS MASSIVE HOMELESS POPULATION THAT WE HAVE NOW- FIRST FOUR I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY BECAUSE THEY DO A POOR JOB OF EXPLAINING- MYSELF SOMETIMES THAT. I AM A HUGE SUPPORTER FROM THE SUPPORT OF HOUSING AND I DO BELIEVE THAT IT IS ULTIMATELY- WHERE WE NEED TO GO. I'M A HUGE BELIEVER IN A PREVENTATIVE- MEASURES- ESPECIALLY WITH RENTAL HOUSING POPULATION AND I'VE SUPPORTED THOSE LIKE MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM- BUT WHAT NEITHER OF AND I APPRECIATE SO MUCH OF A MISS REPORT EMPHASIZING THAT POINT- WHAT NONE OF THAT DOES IS TAKE CARE OF WHAT'S OUT THERE RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF 70% OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION UNSHELTERED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHICH IS WHAT THE NUMBER IS IN THE DOCUMENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN FOR TODAY'S MEETING I'M NOT MAKING THOSE UP THOSE ARE TODAY'S NUMBERS IF ANYTHING I WOULD SAY. IF I WAS GOING TO SURMISE THAT WOULD SAY THEY'RE PROBABLY UNDERSTATED- IN TERMS OF OVERALL NUMBERS- SO EARLY MICHAEL. WERE INTENDED TO SAY BOTH AND BOTH HAND- NOT THAT I MADE A MISTAKE BY PASSING A ONE BILLION DOLLAR BOND IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY FOR PERMITS PART OF HOUSING. THE MOST THAT WAS GOOD THE MISTAKE WAS NOT TO HAVE A GREATER OR GREATER OR EQUAL INVESTMENT. IN SHELTER TO GET US CAUGHT UP- THE MOST GRAPHIC ILLUSTRATION I COULD GIVE OF WHAT I'M SAYING THAT GOES BACK TO THE EARLIER COMMENTS- BY THE PRESENTER. WAS THIS- IN THE STATEMENT I BELIEVE WAS THAT. WE NEED THE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SO THAT WE CAN TAKE THE SHELTERS AND USE THEM AS FEEDERS INTO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. WE DON'T HAVE SHELTERS OUR FEEDERS ARE NOT SHELTERS- IN I CAN'T SPEAK FOR EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE- BUT I CERTAINLY BELIEVE ARE COUNTY IS SOME TO SOME DEGREE A MICROCOSM OF WHAT'S OCCURRING- WE'RE TRYING TO USE CREEKS. UNDERPASSES SIDEWALKS AS FEEDERS INTO A PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING SYSTEM THAT TAKES YEARS AND YEARS THE TO BUILD AND DEVELOP IN IN IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT AN ACCEPTABLE STRATEGY WITH THE CONSTITUENTS THAT WE REPRESENT. IF YOU WERE TO FLY INTO MINETA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT SIMS INTERNATIONAL. TO TAKE A TOUR OF THE SHELTER PROGRAM IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY OR IN SAN JOSE YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO LEAVE OF THE AREA OF THE AIRPORT YOU CAN GET RIGHT BACK ON THE PLANE LEAVE BECAUSE THE SHELTER PROGRAM IS SOMETHING CALLED THE GUADALUPE CREEK. OR RIVER WHICH RUNS RIGHT NEXT TO THE AIRPORT. IN I WAS IN NEW YORK- NOT SO LONG AGO WHERE THEY DO BOTH AND THEY MAKE AN EQUAL INVESTMENT IN SHELTER. AND OFTENTIMES SIDE BY SIDE. SOON SHELTER THOSE WHO WERE SHELTERED CAN SEE WHERE THEY'RE GOING NEXT- WHAT THE GOAL IS THE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING STUDIO APARTMENT WITH WITH THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES. I WAS ASKED TO NEW YORK- BUT BY THEIR HOUSING OFFICIALS FOR TOUR OF OUR OF OUR COUNTY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. INTO AND I SAID THE SAME THING TO THEM THAT I'M SAYING TO YOU TODAY I'M EMBARRASSED TO BRING YOU TO CALIFORNIA BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A SHELTER FEEDER PROGRAM- THAT FEEDS INTO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING- WE IN CALIFORNIA THUS FAR- HAVE. USE THE GREAT OUTDOORS AS AS A FEEDER SYSTEM I DON'T THINK YOU NEED TO FLY INTO SAN JOSE INTERNATIONAL IF YOU'RE SACRAMENTO. RESIDENT ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WALK ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE CAPITOL TO THE STARBUCKS. IN YOU'LL SEE FROM OUR SHELTER PROGRAM IT'S PEOPLE IN SLEEPING BAGS RIGHT NOW TODAY HOUSING AGAIN IS A GREAT THING- BUT IN THE FOUR TO FIVE TO SIX YEARS OR MORE THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO GET THAT HOUSING BUILT. THOSE FOLKS ARE GONNA SURVIVE IN ALL I'M TRYING TO SAY IS THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE TO THE CONSTITUENTS I REPRESENT. OF THE SOUL. FULL CIRCLE TO THE BUDGET I AM I'M PLEADING FOR ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION- FOR. INVESTMENTS IN SHELTER UNTIL WE GET CAUGHT UP WHEN WE GET CAUGHT UP THEN I THINK THIS. ALGORITHM OF MOVING THE FOLKS FROM SHELTER INCOMES WERE OF HOUSING WILL WORK AS AS A NICE SMOOTH OPERATION. BUT IT WASN'T ME IT WAS ONE OF THE PRESENTERS WHO SAID. THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE'RE BEING OVERWHELMED- BY HELLO FOLKS FALLING INTO HOMELESSNESS QUOTE ON QUOTE- AND THAT'S WHY OUR PERMITS FOR HOUSING INVESTMENT IS IN KEEPING UP ON. WELL WE NEED TO SHELTER THEM WITH THE PHONE INTO HOMELESSNESS- WE CAN'T SAY. DON'T WORRY- WE'RE GOING TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM BECOMING LIKE YOU. THEY'RE ALREADY IN HOMELESS SISTERS IN A WAY TO. PREVENT THAT FROM HAPPENING. IN AND IT'S A HUGE NUMBER AND IT'S BECOMING- I THINK THE BIGGEST POLITICAL LIGHTNING ROD IN THE STATE RIGHT NOW SO. FOR WHATEVER THAT'S WORTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH GIVE MANAGER. SENATOR WHETHER IT BE ABLE TO RESPOND. SURE THANK YOU- THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR I AGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT YOU SAID I DO THINK IT IS BOTH AND WE DO NEED MORE WHAT I WOULD CALL INTERIM OPTIONS WHICH COULD BE A SHELTER COULD BE MOTEL STAY OR OR OTHER OPTIONS OUT THERE- AT THE SAME TIME I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY SOME OF MY COMMENTS I ACTUALLY THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT SOMETIMES BUILDING NEW HOUSING TAKES A LONG TIME. AND WE NEED A STRATEGY THAT ALSO INCLUDES HOUSING SUBSIDIES AND WITH HOUSING SUBSIDIES WE CAN ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE HOUSE WITH MUCH MORE QUICKLY I DON'T THINK IT'S YOU KNOW ONE VERSUS THE OTHER IT IS ALL OF THOSE IN OUR LOCAL SYSTEMS WE NEED A BALANCED APPROACH IF WE HAVE LOTS OF SHELTER BEDS OR LOTS OF INTERIM OPTIONS AND NOW HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WHO GO TO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO KEEP BUILDING MORE AND MORE SHELTER BEDS AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO CLARIFY- THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE AN EXIT STRATEGY FROM THE SHELTERS TO. THE PERMANENT HOUSING AND WHETHER THAT'S AFFORDABLE BECAUSE NOT I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT NOT EVERYBODY NEEDS SUPPORT OF HOUSING SOME PEOPLE NEED AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT THEY DON'T NEED THE SERVICES THAT GO ALONG WITH SUPPORTIVE HOUSING- SO I THINK WE NEED MORE OF A BALANCED APPROACH IN SOME COMMUNITIES ALL WE HAVE IS SHELTERS IN SOME COMMUNITIES WE HAVE VERY FEW TO NO SHELTER OR ENSURING HOUSING OPTIONS SO I AGREE WITH YOU WE NEED A BOTH AND STRATEGY AND GETTING PEOPLE HOUSE QUICKLY MEANS BOTH BUILDING TO INCREASE THE HOUSING STOCK AS WELL AS HOUSING SUBSIDIES TO GET PEOPLE HOUSED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND THE MORE HOUSING WE HAVE THE FEWER SHELTER BEDS WE NEED THE PROBLEM WITH SHELTERS AND SOMETIMES IF YOU BUILD A LOT. OF SHELTERS AND YOU DON'T HAVE. GOAL X. AND- HOUSING IT MEANS PEOPLE STAYING THE SHELTER FOR NINE TO TWELVE MONTHS WHICH IS VERY COMMON IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND SO AGAIN THEN YOU HAVE TO BUILD MORE SHELTERS IN PLACES LIKE NEW YORK THAT HAVE A RIGHT TO SHELTER- UNFORTUNATELY THEY FIND THAT THEY HAVE TO SPEND MORE AND MORE MONEY EVERY YEAR. TO KEEP PACE WITH THAT RIGHT SHELTER BECAUSE NONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING IN SHELTERS ARE EXTREMELY PERMANENT HOUSING. SO WE SEE IN THE YORK SOME PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN THE SHELTERS FOR UP TO THREE YEARS. SO WE YOU KNOW I THINK WE HAVE TO. REALLY LOOK AT ALL OF THOSE STRATEGIES AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PROMOTING A BALANCED APPROACH I'M IN LOS ANGELES THEY'VE- THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THAT WE NEED FOUR TO FIVE PERMANENT HOUSING SLOTS. FOR EVERY SHELTER BED IN THE BAY AREA I THINK IT'S MORE OF LIKE- WHEN SHELTER BED. TO PERMANENT HOUSING SITES AND OR PREVENTION SLOTS. SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY. THAT AS WELL THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER UP MICROPHONES UP SO AT THIS POINT IN TIME I'D LIKE TO THANK THE MEMBERS. OF THE SECOND PANEL INTO THE MEMBERS OF THE HOUSING COMMITTEE. FOR JOINING US TODAY WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ANYONE WANTING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT REGARDING ITEMS ON THIS AGENDA. AS A REMINDER WE WILL ALSO HEAR PUBLIC COMMENT ON- SPECIFIC BUDGET ITEMS AT THE END OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING.

THANK YOU I TWENTY NOW THREE GO AHEAD. A LINE TWENTY NINE READING FROM A NOVEMBER TWENTY THIRD CALIFORNIA GLOBE ARTICLE BY KATIE CRIMES. WHY IS HOMELESSNESS GROWING IN CALIFORNIA BUT DECLINING IN EVERY OTHER STATE IN THE COUNTRY CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE NOW EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ACROSS THE STATE A FIFTEEN ACCORDING TO THE INDEPENDENT INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH AND EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATION. THE POSTER CHILD OF HOMELESSNESS IN CALIFORNIA IS THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA I'M WHICH HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS WILL NOT BE RESOLVED UNTIL POLICY MAKERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS STOP RELYING ON CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES WHICH WE DO NOT WORK THE INDEPENDENT INSTITUTE SAYS. THE CARD FOR THIS TRAGIC INCREASE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO PRIMARILY FAILING STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT POLICIES THAT HAVE FUELED HOMELESSNESS THE INDEPENDENT INSTITUTE SAYS. THIS INCLUDES DIRECTING FUNDING ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TO HOUSING FIRST A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH TO HOMELESSNESS. USING THIS APPROACH TOWARDS EVERY HOMELESS INDIVIDUAL IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE SEVENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. AND STUDIES SHOW HOUSING FIRST DOES NOT REDUCE HOMELESSNESS. MEANWHILE AN IMMENSE GOVERNMENT REGULATORY REGIME ON HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ON HOUSING DEVELOPMENT DISINCENTIVES AND OBSTRUCTS THE BUILDING OF ALL HOUSING DRIVING THE CRISIS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BEYOND HOMELESSNESS GOOD INTENTIONS BAD OUTCOMES TRANSFORMATIVE SOLUTIONS. EXAMINES HOUSING POLICY AND CONCLUDES THAT CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS MUST BE RESOLVED NOT ONLY FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS BUT FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. COURT ALSO SHOWS THAT SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS CAN BE MADE TOWARD RESOLVING HOMELESSNESS MODERATOR EVEN INTO YOU CAN ON THE LANDING HOUSING. AT THE DATA WE HAVE ABOUT SEVEN MORE IN Q.
