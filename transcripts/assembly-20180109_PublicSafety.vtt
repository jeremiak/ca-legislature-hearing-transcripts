00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:27.692 region:rollup2
THIS MATTER.

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:29.494 region:rollup2
I THERE IS NOT SUPPORT TAKE

00:40:27.692 --> 00:40:31.596 region:rollup2
CREATE LAWS THAT TREAT.

00:40:29.494 --> 00:40:32.330 region:rollup2
REPEAT OFFENDERS THE SAME AS

00:40:31.596 --> 00:40:33.932 region:rollup2
THAT FIRST TIME LOW LEVEL

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:36.301 region:rollup2
OFFENDER. WHICH IS WHY WE'VE

00:40:33.932 --> 00:40:38.503 region:rollup2
CRAFTED THIS TO BE.

00:40:36.301 --> 00:40:41.973 region:rollup2
TARGETED FOCUSING PRIMARILY ON

00:40:38.503 --> 00:40:43.207 region:rollup2
REPEAT OFFENDERS.

00:40:41.973 --> 00:40:44.409 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT THIS WORK BECAUSE

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:45.677 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHAT THE LAW USED TO BE

00:40:44.409 --> 00:40:46.978 region:rollup2
THIS OF WHAT WE USED AS A TOOL

00:40:45.677 --> 00:40:49.514 region:rollup2
TO GO AFTER THE FOLKS WERE

00:40:46.978 --> 00:40:52.850 region:rollup2
CREATING MOST OF THE PROBLEMS.

00:40:49.514 --> 00:40:53.117 region:rollup2
AND WAS EFFECTIVE SO GOING BACK

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:53.251 region:rollup2
TO IT IS.

00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:55.653 region:rollup2
.

00:40:53.251 --> 00:40:56.821 region:rollup2
IS IT IS.

00:40:55.653 --> 00:40:58.523 region:rollup2
SOME THAT WE KNOW WILL WORK AND

00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:59.757 region:rollup2
BE A IMPACT FALL FOR THIS ISSUE

00:40:58.523 --> 00:40:59.957 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE DIVERSION PIECE IS

00:40:59.757 --> 00:41:01.592 region:rollup2
ALSO.

00:40:59.957 --> 00:41:02.460 region:rollup2
.

00:41:01.592 --> 00:41:03.728 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE REALIZE THAT THERE

00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:05.330 region:rollup2
ARE FOLKS OUT THERE THAT HAVE

00:41:03.728 --> 00:41:06.831 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS ALCOHOL

00:41:05.330 --> 00:41:08.833 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT NEED TO BE. A

00:41:06.831 --> 00:41:11.002 region:rollup2
TAKEN CARE OF THROUGH TREATMENT

00:41:08.833 --> 00:41:12.837 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN PUNISHMENT.

00:41:11.002 --> 00:41:14.038 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHY WE INCLUDED THAT

00:41:12.837 --> 00:41:15.640 region:rollup2
PIECE YOU KNOW THERE WERE SOME

00:41:14.038 --> 00:41:17.709 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT. OFFICERS HAD

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.609 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHY ALLOW IT FOR THE THIRD

00:41:17.709 --> 00:41:20.345 region:rollup2
TIME OFFENDER NOT THE FIRST TIME

00:41:18.609 --> 00:41:21.713 region:rollup2
OFFENDER. YOU KNOW DA'S CAN

00:41:20.345 --> 00:41:22.280 region:rollup2
ALREADY ALLOW DIVERSION FOR

00:41:21.713 --> 00:41:24.215 region:rollup2
FIRST TIME OFFENDERS THAT'S

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:25.383 region:rollup2
ALREADY AVAILABLE FOR GOING

00:41:24.215 --> 00:41:26.517 region:rollup2
ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT HERE.

00:41:25.383 --> 00:41:28.386 region:rollup2
SOMEONE THAT HAS NOT BEEN DONE

00:41:26.517 --> 00:41:30.588 region:rollup2
BEFORE TO GIVE IT FOR REPEAT

00:41:28.386 --> 00:41:31.489 region:rollup2
OFFENDERS IS WE DO UNDERSTAND

00:41:30.588 --> 00:41:33.725 region:rollup2
THE SERIOUSNESS OF A.

00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:35.226 region:rollup2
DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTION.

00:41:33.725 --> 00:41:37.428 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THIS IS THIS IS A

00:41:35.226 --> 00:41:39.297 region:rollup2
TAILORED APPROACH AT FIXING AN

00:41:37.428 --> 00:41:40.298 region:rollup2

INCARCERATION NO POLICE CHIEF IN

00:41:44.669 --> 00:41:47.572 region:rollup2
THE STATE WANTS THAT WAS

00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:48.773 region:rollup2
ADVOCATING FOR THAT.

00:41:47.572 --> 00:41:51.142 region:rollup2
BUT EVERY CHIEF THAT I'VE TALKED

00:41:48.773 --> 00:41:53.077 region:rollup2
TO.

00:41:51.142 --> 00:41:54.379 region:rollup2
REALIZES THAT THE ISSUE THAT

00:41:53.077 --> 00:41:55.747 region:rollup2
WE'RE FACING IS BECAUSE OF THE

00:41:54.379 --> 00:41:57.382 region:rollup2
THE REFORM THAT WE'VE HAD AND WE

00:41:55.747 --> 00:41:58.783 region:rollup2
NEED CLEAN UP PIECES OF IT. AND

00:41:57.382 --> 00:42:00.218 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE'RE PUSHING FOR

00:41:58.783 --> 00:42:03.154 region:rollup2
WITH THIS LEGISLATION.

00:42:00.218 --> 00:42:03.988 region:rollup2

IS DEALING WITH WITH THE

00:42:14.799 --> 00:42:18.169 region:rollup2
INCREASED LOSSES. AND THAT OUR

00:42:16.667 --> 00:42:19.704 region:rollup2
MEMBER COMPANIES HAVE HAD TO

00:42:18.169 --> 00:42:21.339 region:rollup2
DEAL WITH.

00:42:19.704 --> 00:42:23.241 region:rollup2
IN RECENT YEARS.

IN THE PAST WITH OTHER BILLS.

00:42:36.888 --> 00:42:38.990 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE'S A PROBLEM I

00:42:37.822 --> 00:42:41.159 region:rollup2
THINK WE ALL REALIZE THAT

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:42.193 region:rollup2
THERE'S A PROBLEM AND AND IT

00:42:41.159 --> 00:42:43.594 region:rollup2
NEEDS TO BE FIXED.

00:42:42.193 --> 00:42:45.530 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THIS IS A VERY

00:42:43.594 --> 00:42:47.064 region:rollup2
DISCREET FIX WE'RE NOT TRYING TO

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:48.733 region:rollup2
TO UNDO.

00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:50.735 region:rollup2
ANY PREVIOUS INITIATIVES AS YOU

AND I HAVE DISCUSSED IN THE PAST

00:42:50.735 --> 00:42:53.838 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT OUR INTENT.

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:54.439 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY

00:42:53.838 --> 00:42:56.607 region:rollup2
FOCUSED.

00:42:54.439 --> 00:42:57.508 region:rollup2
SOLUTION TO DEAL WITH THIS

00:42:56.607 --> 00:43:00.778 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

00:42:57.508 --> 00:43:01.145 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF YOUR LOSSES AS

00:43:00.778 --> 00:43:03.915 region:rollup2
MISTER COOPER.

00:43:01.145 --> 00:43:05.917 region:rollup2
CITED IN A STATEMENT OF OUR

00:43:03.915 --> 00:43:08.719 region:rollup2
COMPANIES HAVE SEEN LOSSES FROM

00:43:05.917 --> 00:43:10.021 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWELVE TO DO TO PRESENT

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:11.756 region:rollup2
TIME THAT THAT HAVE BEEN IN SOME

00:43:10.021 --> 00:43:14.125 region:rollup2
CASES ONE HUNDRED. AND FIFTY

00:43:11.756 --> 00:43:15.560 region:rollup2
PERCENT ALMOST IN A PERCENT

00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:17.361 region:rollup2
INCREASE IN LOSSES THAT.

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:18.496 region:rollup2
OUR COMPANIES ARE FINDING OUT

00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:19.964 region:rollup2
THE DOOR AND MIND YOU THAT'S

00:43:18.496 --> 00:43:20.798 region:rollup2
ONLY WHAT THE CATCH NOT DOOR I

00:43:19.964 --> 00:43:21.265 region:rollup2
MEAN THAT'S THAT'S A PERCENTAGE

00:43:20.798 --> 00:43:23.534 region:rollup2
OF. WHAT'S BEING LOST

00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:25.069 region:rollup2
ALTOGETHER.

00:43:23.534 --> 00:43:26.104 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS SHOULD BE

00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:29.240 region:rollup2
A TOOL.

00:43:26.104 --> 00:43:31.209 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY TO ADDRESS.

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:32.143 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM AFTER THE CRIME'S

00:43:31.209 --> 00:43:32.910 region:rollup2
OCCURRED BUT WE ALSO THINK IT

00:43:32.143 --> 00:43:34.278 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE A DETERRENT.

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:35.746 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE'RE SEEING MORE AND

00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:36.547 region:rollup2
MORE PEOPLE COME IN THERE JUST

00:43:35.746 --> 00:43:38.649 region:rollup2
EMBOLDENED THEY JUST COME IN AND

00:43:36.547 --> 00:43:39.717 region:rollup2
AND. KNOWING THAT LAW IS HELD AS

00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:40.985 region:rollup2
THEY JUST THINK THEY HAVE

00:43:39.717 --> 00:43:41.953 region:rollup2
LICENSE TO COME IN AND TAKE TAKE

00:43:40.985 --> 00:43:44.388 region:rollup2
STUFF.

00:43:41.953 --> 00:43:45.656 region:rollup2
YOU MAY RECALL LAST YEAR THERE

00:43:44.388 --> 00:43:46.324 region:rollup2

KILLED.

00:43:47.859 --> 00:43:51.362 region:rollup2
BY SOMEBODY COMING IN.

00:43:49.961 --> 00:43:54.298 region:rollup2
THINKING THAT THEY HAVE LICENSE

00:43:51.362 --> 00:43:55.566 region:rollup2
TO THIS BECAUSE THE LAW HAS AS

00:43:54.298 --> 00:43:56.667 region:rollup2
IN SKIN YOU KNOW IN A PASSIVE

00:43:55.566 --> 00:43:58.269 region:rollup2
WAY GIVEN THEM PERMISSION TO DO

00:43:56.667 --> 00:43:59.837 region:rollup2
THIS WITH NO CONSEQUENCES.

00:43:58.269 --> 00:44:01.606 region:rollup2
INSTEAD OF JUST GO LAST YEAR

00:43:59.837 --> 00:44:02.807 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A WORKER STABBED.

00:44:01.606 --> 00:44:04.876 region:rollup2
BY SOMEBODY COMING AND TRYING TO

00:44:02.807 --> 00:44:06.077 region:rollup2
TAKE STUFF.

00:44:04.876 --> 00:44:07.178 region:rollup2
IN OAK GROVE ACTUALLY MISTER

00:44:06.077 --> 00:44:08.913 region:rollup2
COOPER'S DISTRICT I WAS IN A

00:44:07.178 --> 00:44:10.815 region:rollup2
COUPLE MONTHS AGO THERE WAS AN

00:44:08.913 --> 00:44:14.151 region:rollup2
ELDERLY WOMAN GOT. I BELIEVE SHE

00:44:10.815 --> 00:44:15.153 region:rollup2
WAS KILLED AT A CVS ARTICLES A

00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:17.355 region:rollup2
WALGREEN'S IN LAGUNA.

00:44:15.153 --> 00:44:18.789 region:rollup2
BY THIEVES YOU CAME IN.

00:44:17.355 --> 00:44:20.124 region:rollup2
BUT THEY COULD STEAL RUNNING UP

00:44:18.789 --> 00:44:22.126 region:rollup2
BURDEN AWAY THEY KNOCKED OVER

00:44:20.124 --> 00:44:24.495 region:rollup2
THE KILTER.

00:44:22.126 --> 00:44:25.863 region:rollup2
NO NO. THAT'S NOT GONNA SOLVE

00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:27.532 region:rollup2
SOME THESE MORE VIOLENT FOLKS I

00:44:25.863 --> 00:44:30.134 region:rollup2
GET THAT A SEPARATE CRIME BUT

00:44:27.532 --> 00:44:31.269 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT PEOPLE NOW KNOW.

00:44:30.134 --> 00:44:33.771 region:rollup2
THAT YOU CAN TAKE UP TO NINE

00:44:31.269 --> 00:44:36.107 region:rollup2
HUNDRED FIFTY. BENNETT'S.

00:44:33.771 --> 00:44:38.743 region:rollup2
LOW RISK HIGH REWARD AYE I CAN

00:44:36.107 --> 00:44:40.545 region:rollup2
SHARE WITH YOU VIDEOS OF PEOPLE

00:44:38.743 --> 00:44:42.079 region:rollup2
LITERALLY. WHO COME IN THERE AND

00:44:40.545 --> 00:44:45.249 region:rollup2
TRY TO HIDE IT THE PHILIPPA A

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:47.318 region:rollup2
BASKET WITH WITH BEER OR LIQUOR

00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:49.387 region:rollup2
OR MEET AND JUST? WALK OUT THE

00:44:47.318 --> 00:44:50.922 region:rollup2
DOOR. I'VE HAD SOME STORIES

00:44:49.387 --> 00:44:53.157 region:rollup2
WHERE SOME OF OUR STORES WILL

00:44:50.922 --> 00:44:54.759 region:rollup2
SAY THAT PEOPLE NOW JUST FLIP

00:44:53.157 --> 00:44:55.693 region:rollup2
OFF. AS A WALK A DOG IS A KNOW

00:44:54.759 --> 00:44:59.363 region:rollup2
NOTHING IS DONE.

00:44:55.693 --> 00:45:00.598 region:rollup2
AGAIN YOU KNOW THERE'S NO

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:02.266 region:rollup2
PANACEA THIS IS NOT TO BE A

00:45:00.598 --> 00:45:04.302 region:rollup2
MAGIC BULLET TO FIX ALL THESE

00:45:02.266 --> 00:45:06.404 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS THAT BEING SAID IF

00:45:04.302 --> 00:45:07.838 region:rollup2
THERE'S A TOOL THAT. NOT ONLY

00:45:06.404 --> 00:45:09.874 region:rollup2
CAN DEAL WITH THOSE WHO ARE

00:45:07.838 --> 00:45:11.676 region:rollup2
DOING THIS REPEATEDLY WHICH

00:45:09.874 --> 00:45:13.244 region:rollup2
AGAIN. THIS WOULD ONLY BE

00:45:11.676 --> 00:45:15.313 region:rollup2
APPLIED TO SOME WHO'S DOING OVER

00:45:13.244 --> 00:45:16.614 region:rollup2
AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER. BUT

00:45:15.313 --> 00:45:17.148 region:rollup2
IF WE CAN PREVENT SOME LEASE ON

00:45:16.614 --> 00:45:19.617 region:rollup2
THE FRONT END.

00:45:17.148 --> 00:45:20.851 region:rollup2
WE HELPED LOSSES WE HELP WITH

WORKER SAFETY.

00:45:20.851 --> 00:45:24.288 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK THIS IS A SENSIBLE

00:45:22.687 --> 00:45:26.190 region:rollup2
APPROACH THAT THAT PUTS ANOTHER

00:45:24.288 --> 00:45:28.459 region:rollup2
TOOL IN THE POCKET OF LAW

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:30.094 region:rollup2

HITTING GUN IN PUBLIC PUTS

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:12.568 region:rollup2
OTHERS AT RISK IN IS NOT IN THE

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:14.570 region:rollup2
INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY.

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:16.572 region:rollup2
UP WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE OF

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:18.641 region:rollup2
LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT IS THE

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:20.342 region:rollup2
DECISION TO SHOOT.

01:16:18.641 --> 01:16:23.079 region:rollup2
OR NOT TO SHOOT ASSASSIN A

01:16:20.342 --> 01:16:25.214 region:rollup2
SITUATION HITTING THE TARGET NOT

HITTING BYSTANDERS IS DIFFICULT

01:16:25.214 --> 01:16:29.051 region:rollup2
FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND EXPECT

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:31.120 region:rollup2
THAT THE AVERAGE CITIZEN WOULD

01:16:29.051 --> 01:16:33.022 region:rollup2
PERFORM. BETTER.

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:35.524 region:rollup2
IT'S DOUBTFUL I BELIEVE.

01:16:33.022 --> 01:16:36.826 region:rollup2
THEIR IT OUT IN REFERENCE TO US

THERE HAVE BEEN STUDIES THAT.

01:16:51.474 --> 01:16:54.777 region:rollup2
MORE PEOPLE CARRYING GUNS HAS

01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:57.346 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:58.781 region:rollup2
IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY FOR THOSE

01:16:57.346 --> 01:17:01.183 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OR THOSE STATES AND IN

01:16:58.781 --> 01:17:02.184 region:rollup2
FACT A NEW STUDY CAME OUT LAST

01:17:01.183 --> 01:17:04.720 region:rollup2
YEAR.

01:17:02.184 --> 01:17:06.755 region:rollup2
BY THE STE BY I WAS A STANFORD

UNIVERSITY SCHOOL STUDY. THAT

01:17:06.755 --> 01:17:09.859 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT STATES THAT ADOPTED

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:12.027 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO CARRY LAWS WHICH

01:17:09.859 --> 01:17:13.662 region:rollup2
BASICALLY R. SHALL ISSUE STATES

01:17:12.027 --> 01:17:15.931 region:rollup2
HAVE EXPERIENCE A THIRTEEN TO

01:17:13.662 --> 01:17:17.933 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN PERCENT INCREASE IN

01:17:15.931 --> 01:17:19.401 region:rollup2
VIOLENT CRIME. IN THE TEN YEARS

01:17:17.933 --> 01:17:22.505 region:rollup2
AFTER ENACTING THOSE LOS

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:25.241 region:rollup2
FEELING SAFER WITH A GUN

01:17:22.505 --> 01:17:27.543 region:rollup2
DOESN'T MEAN ONE. IS SAFER AND

01:17:25.241 --> 01:17:29.345 region:rollup2
IN FACT OFTEN NOT ALWAYS BUT

01:17:27.543 --> 01:17:31.914 region:rollup2
OFTEN BEHAVIOR CHANGES WHEN ONE

01:17:29.345 --> 01:17:32.481 region:rollup2
CARRIES A GUN. AND THAT PERSON

01:17:31.914 --> 01:17:34.016 region:rollup2
AND OTHERS MAY BE A GREATER

01:17:32.481 --> 01:17:35.384 region:rollup2
RISK.

01:17:34.016 --> 01:17:38.120 region:rollup2
I WOULD REMIND YOU OF THE

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:38.721 region:rollup2
SHOOTING OF TRAYVON MARTIN IN

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:41.056 region:rollup2
FLORIDA.

01:17:38.721 --> 01:17:42.992 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THAT GEORGE

01:17:41.056 --> 01:17:45.194 region:rollup2
ZIMMERMAN'S BEHAVIOR MAY HAVE

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:47.029 region:rollup2
BEEN DIFFERENT HE MAY NOT HAVE

01:17:45.194 --> 01:17:48.664 region:rollup2
FOLLOW TRAYVON AND SHOT HIM IF

01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:56.038 region:rollup2
HE HAD NOT BEEN CARRYING A GUN.

01:17:48.664 --> 01:17:56.672 region:rollup2
IKE KNOWLEDGE THAT AT TIMES

01:17:56.038 --> 01:17:58.140 region:rollup2
WARILY.

01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:59.909 region:rollup2
DEATH SELF DEFENSE SITUATION

01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:00.276 region:rollup2
DOES HAPPEN BY SOMEONE WHO WAS

ARMED.

01:18:00.276 --> 01:18:04.079 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK.

01:18:02.745 --> 01:18:05.648 region:rollup2
THE BREASTS.

01:18:04.079 --> 01:18:07.583 region:rollup2
OF HAVING MORE LOADED HITTING

AND STUFF LIKE THAT THEY ARE

01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:31.500 region:rollup2
SAFE PLACES THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO

01:19:29.632 --> 01:19:33.002 region:rollup2
ALSO ABIDE BY THE LAW ACCORDING

TO THE LEGISLATURE WHO HAS DONE.

01:19:33.002 --> 01:19:36.705 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH AND FOUND

01:19:34.937 --> 01:19:38.707 region:rollup2
THAT THAT GUN SHOWS ARE SOME OF

01:19:36.705 --> 01:19:41.076 region:rollup2
THE SAFEST PLACES IN THE WORLD.

01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:43.445 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT PEOPLE

01:19:41.076 --> 01:19:45.314 region:rollup2
ARE NOT VIOLATING THE LAW AND.

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:47.316 region:rollup2
THERE WOULD BE NO ADDITIONAL

01:19:45.314 --> 01:19:48.484 region:rollup2
DANGER BY ALLOWING PEOPLE WHO

01:19:47.316 --> 01:19:50.786 region:rollup2
HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROTECT

01:19:48.484 --> 01:19:52.755 region:rollup2

STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:19:53.989 --> 01:19:55.157 region:rollup2
THERE ARE PROVISIONS THAT SAY

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:56.825 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T BRING IT ON THE

01:19:55.157 --> 01:19:58.360 region:rollup2
CAPITAL.

01:19:56.825 --> 01:19:59.828 region:rollup2
THERE ARE NOW STATES WHO HAVE

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.629 region:rollup2
OVERTURNED THAT ARE ALLOWING

01:19:59.828 --> 01:20:02.331 region:rollup2
CITIZENS TO TO TO CARRY

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:04.099 region:rollup2

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:17.346 region:rollup2
SUPPORTED. I THINK YOU'D

01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:18.947 region:rollup2
PROBABLY FIND SOME SUPPORT BUT

01:20:17.346 --> 01:20:20.582 region:rollup2
THE LOGIC IS THAT.

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:21.083 region:rollup2
IF YOU ARE SAYING THE PEOPLE

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:23.085 region:rollup2

SCALIA AND IN IN HELLER.

01:20:28.424 --> 01:20:32.961 region:rollup2

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:33.562 region:rollup2
ADMITTING THAT THIS HAD TO COME

01:20:32.961 --> 01:20:35.030 region:rollup2

MEANT.

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:41.503 region:rollup2
THEN THAT THAT KINDA TELLS YOU

01:20:40.035 --> 01:20:42.805 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE REALLY SHOULD HAVE

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:43.539 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT TO PROTECT THEMSELVES

01:20:42.805 --> 01:20:45.808 region:rollup2

PREVENTED.

01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:08.317 region:rollup2
BY PEOPLE WHO ARE ABLE TO CARRY

ROUGHLY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED

01:23:23.265 --> 01:23:25.701 region:rollup2
THOUSAND OF THAT NUMBER. SO WE

01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:27.870 region:rollup2
TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IS THE

01:23:25.701 --> 01:23:29.004 region:rollup2
ACTUAL RISK OF ALLOWING SOMEONE

ABILITY TO CARRY THAT ANYWHERE

01:23:38.013 --> 01:23:41.116 region:rollup2

YEAH IT'S KIND OF AYE

01:31:04.993 --> 01:31:08.063 region:rollup2

CONTACTS. WE'RE DEALING WITH

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:14.235 region:rollup2
MINORS.

TO BEGIN QUESTIONING I DON'T

01:31:17.739 --> 01:31:21.376 region:rollup2
BELIEVE SO SO I JUST KIND OF

01:31:19.441 --> 01:31:23.178 region:rollup2
WONDERING WHAT. IN YOUR VIEW IS

01:31:21.376 --> 01:31:24.079 region:rollup2
KIND OF THE STANDARD FOR WHAT WE

01:31:23.178 --> 01:31:26.281 region:rollup2
SEPARATE THINGS THAT REQUIRE

01:31:24.079 --> 01:31:27.849 region:rollup2
PARENTAL CONSENT FROM. THOSE

01:31:26.281 --> 01:31:30.151 region:rollup2
THAT DOWN AND WHY DOES THIS FALL

01:31:27.849 --> 01:31:31.319 region:rollup2
ON ONE PARTICULAR SIDELINED.

01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:33.188 region:rollup2
MY AYE I ANTICIPATED.

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:34.322 region:rollup2
THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE THIS

01:31:33.188 --> 01:31:34.856 region:rollup2
QUESTION I THINK YOU'RE TALKING

01:31:34.322 --> 01:31:36.191 region:rollup2
ABOUT SOME OF THE HEALTH

01:31:34.856 --> 01:31:37.859 region:rollup2
DECISIONS PEOPLE MAKE WITHOUT

01:31:36.191 --> 01:31:39.561 region:rollup2
PARENTAL CONSENT I'M NOT OKAY

01:31:37.859 --> 01:31:39.861 region:rollup2
WAS BROUGHT UP BY OUR STAFF SO.

01:31:39.561 --> 01:31:41.196 region:rollup2
TO BE CLEAR.

01:31:39.861 --> 01:31:43.331 region:rollup2
.

01:31:41.196 --> 01:31:45.967 region:rollup2
I I THINK THAT IN AREAS WHERE

01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:48.103 region:rollup2
THERE IS AN ABILITY TO I'M HAVE

01:31:45.967 --> 01:31:49.170 region:rollup2
SELF DETERMINATION BY YOUNG

01:31:48.103 --> 01:31:50.939 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY'RE HEALTH

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:52.340 region:rollup2
DECISIONS THAT'S ONE THING.

01:31:50.939 --> 01:31:53.541 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY'RE BEING COERCED

01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:54.809 region:rollup2
AND AND THERE'S NO WAY YOU CAN

01:31:53.541 --> 01:31:56.378 region:rollup2
TELL ME THAT YOUNG PERSON IS NOT

01:31:54.809 --> 01:31:58.346 region:rollup2
BEING COERCED WHEN A POLICE

01:31:56.378 --> 01:32:00.115 region:rollup2
OFFICER STOPS A MOUSE THEM TO?

01:31:58.346 --> 01:32:01.216 region:rollup2
CONSENT TO SOMETHING THAT

01:32:00.115 --> 01:32:02.384 region:rollup2
THAT'S A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

01:32:01.216 --> 01:32:04.085 region:rollup2
SITUATION IT WAS THE SAME

01:32:02.384 --> 01:32:06.488 region:rollup2
SITUATION WITH I THINK LAST YEAR

01:32:04.085 --> 01:32:09.457 region:rollup2
WE DID THE MIRANDA RIGHTS ISSUE.

01:32:06.488 --> 01:32:11.092 region:rollup2
EIGHT THAT THE THE.

01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:12.861 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY FIGURE.

01:32:11.092 --> 01:32:14.629 region:rollup2
COMING AND ASKING THEM TO

01:32:12.861 --> 01:32:16.631 region:rollup2
CONSENTED SOMETHING THAT WE'VE

01:32:14.629 --> 01:32:17.899 region:rollup2
TOLD HOPEFULLY MOST OF US HAVE.

01:32:16.631 --> 01:32:19.434 region:rollup2
NOW MY NEIGHBORHOODS A LITTLE

01:32:17.899 --> 01:32:20.235 region:rollup2
BIT MORE BEGRUDGINGLY BUT TOLD

01:32:19.434 --> 01:32:22.170 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO.

01:32:20.235 --> 01:32:23.471 region:rollup2
TO TRUST THE POLICE AND AND TO

01:32:22.170 --> 01:32:25.206 region:rollup2
DO WHAT THEY SAY.

01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:27.575 region:rollup2
I THINK WE HAVEN'T PROVIDED OUR

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:29.377 region:rollup2
YOUNG PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO.

01:32:27.575 --> 01:32:31.446 region:rollup2
CONSENT FULL DISCLOSURE.

01:32:29.377 --> 01:32:32.313 region:rollup2
IN MEDICAL SITUATIONS I THINK.

01:32:31.446 --> 01:32:34.115 region:rollup2
IN PARTICULAR WITH.

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:35.350 region:rollup2
.

01:32:34.115 --> 01:32:36.351 region:rollup2
YOUNG PERSONS RIGHT TO MAKE

01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:37.652 region:rollup2
MEDICAL DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES

01:32:36.351 --> 01:32:38.686 region:rollup2
IT'S A AT COMPLEX COMPLETELY

01:32:37.652 --> 01:32:39.621 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT SITUATION WHERE

01:32:38.686 --> 01:32:42.524 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SEEKING OUT.

01:32:39.621 --> 01:32:43.091 region:rollup2
.

01:32:42.524 --> 01:32:44.759 region:rollup2
SOMETHING BE DONE NOT BEEN

01:32:43.091 --> 01:32:45.794 region:rollup2
COERCED TO DO IT.

01:32:44.759 --> 01:32:47.162 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT MEDICAL

01:32:45.794 --> 01:32:48.430 region:rollup2
DECISION THAT MEAN THAT THAT'S

01:32:47.162 --> 01:32:50.665 region:rollup2
THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD ANSWER I

01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:51.966 region:rollup2
THINK THIS IDEA OF COERCION I'M.

01:32:50.665 --> 01:32:52.200 region:rollup2
OF COURSE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT

01:32:51.966 --> 01:32:54.069 region:rollup2
SORT OF.

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:56.070 region:rollup2
IN HOPE OF BEING OPEN TO

01:32:54.069 --> 01:32:57.439 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS BY LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:32:56.070 --> 01:33:00.275 region:rollup2
AND DOESN'T REQUIRE CONSENT THAT

01:32:57.439 --> 01:33:02.510 region:rollup2
SAME ARGUMENT FIVE SO I THINK

01:33:00.275 --> 01:33:04.279 region:rollup2
THAT THAT. IS WHY DO I TELL NOT

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:05.613 region:rollup2
TO ANSWER.

01:33:04.279 --> 01:33:07.515 region:rollup2
RIGHT AS I YOU CAN TEACH YOUR

01:33:05.613 --> 01:33:09.651 region:rollup2
CHILD NOT CONSENT TO.

01:33:07.515 --> 01:33:10.952 region:rollup2
AND GIVE EXAMPLES BUT I.

01:33:09.651 --> 01:33:12.520 region:rollup2
SO I I WAS THE BILL I THINK THAT

01:33:10.952 --> 01:33:13.354 region:rollup2

YOUR INTUITIONS R. REPLY RIGHT I

01:33:13.354 --> 01:33:16.458 region:rollup2
JUST THINK WE NEED A LITTLE MORE

01:33:13.988 --> 01:33:16.925 region:rollup2
FULLY FORMED KIND OF THEORY. AS

01:33:16.458 --> 01:33:19.994 region:rollup2
TO WIN.

01:33:16.925 --> 01:33:20.995 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW CONSENT.

01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:22.997 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE THERE WHEN IT SHOULD.

01:33:20.995 --> 01:33:23.865 region:rollup2
SUCH.

01:33:22.997 --> 01:33:26.134 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENT YOU

01:33:23.865 --> 01:33:28.069 region:rollup2
