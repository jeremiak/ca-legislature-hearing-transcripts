SO OUR GOAL IS TO BRING THOSE

01:04:26.062 --> 01:04:27.563
DOWN BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE ARE

01:04:27.630 --> 01:04:29.565
GETTING RID OF THEIR LAN LINE.

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:30.499
SO WE DEPEND ON THE FUNDING

01:04:30.566 --> 01:04:33.970
RIGHT NOW AND IF THAT GOES AWAY

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:36.038
THAT FUND THE KEEPS GOING DOWN

01:04:36.105 --> 01:04:37.373
SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.874
THIS FUN BECAUSE AS WE KNOW

01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:40.676
TECHNOLOGY CHANGES ALL THE TIME

01:04:40.743 --> 01:04:42.612

01:11:37.526 --> 01:11:42.264
CONNECTION. IS EXTRAORDINARY-

01:11:42.331 --> 01:11:44.166

01:11:44.233 --> 01:11:45.401
HALF HOURS AND IN FACT THAT

THE TIME IT'S ALMOST

01:11:52.307 --> 01:11:54.376
FRUSTRATING UNDERSTAND HOW YOU

COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK-

01:12:10.225 --> 01:12:11.360

01:12:32.948 --> 01:12:34.416

TELEHEALTH HAS BECOME MORE

01:13:04.646 --> 01:13:06.815
IMPORTANT. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE

01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:08.383

SPIRIT. OF THE BILL AND JUST

01:16:21.643 --> 01:16:22.444

THAT- IN THE WORKGROUP I

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:25.614

BECOMES. SO MUCH MORE CRITICAL

01:57:22.001 --> 01:57:23.002
AND IMPORTANT FOR US TO TAKE A

01:57:23.069 --> 01:57:24.570
LOOK AT THAT. WE NOW HAVE BEEN

01:57:24.637 --> 01:57:27.173
A LOT MORE IN COMMON WITH RURAL

01:58:01.441 --> 01:58:03.142
EFFORT FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

01:58:03.209 --> 01:58:04.811
HAND OUT HOT SPOTS WELL WE

01:58:04.877 --> 01:58:06.779

JUST CLICK A SWITCHING CONNECT.

01:58:10.450 --> 01:58:11.551
THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS IN MY

CALIFORNIA. IT'LL I CAN'T SAY

01:58:16.656 --> 01:58:19.959
ENOUGH OF HOW DEVASTATING. IT

01:58:20.026 --> 01:58:22.462
WAS THE WAKE UP. DURING A

01:58:22.528 --> 01:58:26.399
DURING A- COLBY CRISIS ONLY TO

01:58:26.466 --> 01:58:29.735
FIND OUT. THAT GENERATIONS OF

FAMILIES WILL BE LEFT BEHIND

01:58:33.673 --> 01:58:34.373
THAT THE INTERNET ACCESS THAT

KIDS WERE NOT ABLE TO LEARN IT

01:58:41.113 --> 01:58:43.015
WAS HEARTBREAKING TO SEE. IN A

01:58:43.082 --> 01:58:45.051
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND THE

01:58:45.117 --> 01:58:45.618

CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS COMMITTEE

02:10:47.739 --> 02:10:49.308
IS WELL AWARE OF THE MYRIAD OF

02:10:49.374 --> 02:10:50.542
WAYS IN WHICH THE DIGITAL

02:10:50.609 --> 02:10:52.611
DIVIDE HAS EXACERBATED THE

02:10:52.678 --> 02:10:54.780
CHALLENGES OF THE PAST YEAR.

02:10:54.846 --> 02:10:56.081
THE SOLUTIONS I PUT FORWARD IN

02:10:56.148 --> 02:10:57.849
AB FORTY ONE OR NOT A SILVER

02:10:57.916 --> 02:10:59.718
BULLET. BUT THEY ARE IMPORTANT

02:10:59.785 --> 02:11:00.819
STEPS AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO

02:11:00.886 --> 02:11:02.054
BRING CALIFORNIA'S DATA

02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:03.622
INFRASTRUCTURE INTO THE TWENTY

02:11:03.689 --> 02:11:05.891
FIRST CENTURY. SINCE TAKING

02:11:05.958 --> 02:11:07.926
OFFICE COMMONSENSE EXPANSION OF

02:11:07.993 --> 02:11:09.494
RURAL BROADBAND ACCESS HAS BEEN

02:11:09.561 --> 02:11:11.730
A PRIORITY OF MINE. THE CONCEPT

02:11:11.797 --> 02:11:13.865
OF DIG ONCE IS NOT A NEW POLICY

02:11:13.932 --> 02:11:15.667
AREA FOR ME I'M BRINGING THIS

02:11:15.734 --> 02:11:17.369
CONCEPT BEFORE YOU AGAIN.

02:11:17.436 --> 02:11:18.737
BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF

02:11:18.804 --> 02:11:20.072
OUR STATE AGENCIES DO NOT

02:11:20.138 --> 02:11:22.107
RECOGNIZE THE URGENCY WITH

02:11:22.174 --> 02:11:24.409
WHICH WE MUST ROLL OUT CRITICAL

02:11:24.476 --> 02:11:27.012
BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. THE

02:11:27.079 --> 02:11:27.412
FEDERAL HIGHWAY IN

02:11:27.479 --> 02:11:29.448
ADMINISTRATION. NO TO TAKING

02:11:29.514 --> 02:11:30.382
ADVANTAGE OF DIG ONCE

02:11:30.449 --> 02:11:32.417
OPPORTUNITIES CUTS THE COST OF

02:11:32.484 --> 02:11:34.253
BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT BY NINETY

02:11:34.319 --> 02:11:36.722
PERCENT. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO

02:11:36.788 --> 02:11:38.757
LET THESE OPPORTUNITIES GO BY.

02:11:38.824 --> 02:11:40.559
PUT SIMPLY AS WE UPGRADE OUR

02:11:40.626 --> 02:11:41.860
STATE ROADWAYS WE NEED TO

02:11:41.927 --> 02:11:44.930
DETERMINE HOW NOT IF BROADBAND

02:11:44.997 --> 02:11:46.498
IS A PART OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:11:46.565 --> 02:11:48.433
IMPROVEMENTS. THEY WERE GOING

02:11:48.500 --> 02:11:49.735
TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC

02:11:49.801 --> 02:11:50.969
DOLLARS IN CRITICAL

02:11:51.036 --> 02:11:52.004
IMPROVEMENTS TO BROADBAND

02:11:52.070 --> 02:11:53.705
INFRASTRUCTURE. WE NEED TO ASK

02:11:53.772 --> 02:11:55.540
A LITTLE MORE OF OUR PARTNERS

02:11:55.607 --> 02:11:57.109
IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THERE

02:11:57.175 --> 02:11:58.510
ARE INSTANCES MY DISTRICT WHERE

02:11:58.577 --> 02:12:00.078
BUSINESSES ARE INDIVIDUALS HAVE

02:12:00.145 --> 02:12:01.613
PAID IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:03.515
OF DOLLARS TO BRING BROADBAND

02:12:03.582 --> 02:12:04.016
SERVICE TO THEIR HOME OR

02:12:04.082 --> 02:12:06.518
BUSINESS. WE HAD HOPED THAT

02:12:06.585 --> 02:12:08.220
NARROW EXTENSIONS WOULD PROVIDE

02:12:08.287 --> 02:12:09.821
OPPORTUNITIES TO CONNECT OTHERS

02:12:09.888 --> 02:12:12.057
ALONG THE WAY OR MORE INTO MORE

02:12:12.124 --> 02:12:13.258
INDIVIDUALS NEAR THE DESK THE

02:12:13.325 --> 02:12:14.960
DESTINATION. BUT THAT'S NOT THE

02:12:15.027 --> 02:12:17.396
CASE. COMMUNITIES ARE BEING

02:12:17.462 --> 02:12:19.498
PASSED OVER NOT BECAUSE THEY

02:12:19.564 --> 02:12:21.466
ARE NOT PROFITABLE BECAUSE

02:12:21.533 --> 02:12:24.336
THEY'RE NOT PROFITABLE ENOUGH.

02:12:24.403 --> 02:12:25.837
JUST LIKE WE CAN UPGRADE OUR

02:12:25.904 --> 02:12:26.872
STATE ROADWAYS WITHOUT

02:12:26.938 --> 02:12:28.974
CONSIDERING DEMAND FOR DATA WE

02:12:29.041 --> 02:12:30.275
CANNOT CONTINUE TO MISS

02:12:30.342 --> 02:12:31.310
OPPORTUNITIES TO CONNECT

02:12:31.376 --> 02:12:32.911
COMMUNITIES WHEN PRIVATELY

02:12:32.978 --> 02:12:34.513
FUNDED PROJECTS BRING

02:12:34.579 --> 02:12:36.848
INFRASTRUCTURE TO NEW AREAS.

02:12:36.915 --> 02:12:38.717
ONE ENTITY PAIN STAGGERING SUMS

02:12:38.784 --> 02:12:40.085
TO GET CONNECTED IS NOT WHAT

02:12:40.152 --> 02:12:42.788
THE DEBT MARKET DICTATES IT'S

02:12:42.854 --> 02:12:44.790
BROADBAND GERRYMANDERING. THE

02:12:44.856 --> 02:12:46.591
EXISTING LINE EXTENSION PROGRAM

02:12:46.658 --> 02:12:48.527
OFFERED TO THE C. P. U. C. IS

02:12:48.593 --> 02:12:50.162
NOT ENOUGH AND I BELIEVE THAT

02:12:50.228 --> 02:12:51.163
THERE ARE UNDER UTILIZED

02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:52.364
MARKETS IN MY DISTRICT IN IN

02:12:52.431 --> 02:12:55.033
THE STATE. I UNDERSTAND THERE

02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:56.268
IS A SOME OPPOSITION FROM THE

02:12:56.335 --> 02:12:57.736
CABLE INDUSTRY ON A ON THIS

02:12:57.803 --> 02:12:59.504
ASPECT OF MY BILL. I HOPE THEY

02:12:59.571 --> 02:13:01.173
RECOGNIZE THIS FRUSTRATION THAT

02:13:01.239 --> 02:13:02.040
I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM MY

02:13:02.107 --> 02:13:03.909
CONSTITUENTS. I THINK WE CAN

02:13:03.975 --> 02:13:05.210
WORK TOGETHER TO SERVE MORE

02:13:05.277 --> 02:13:08.113
CUSTOMERS WE NEED TO DO BETTER.

02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:09.848
ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY IN

02:13:09.915 --> 02:13:11.950
