DISCUSSIONS I DO KNOW THERE IS

00:50:48.478 --> 00:50:51.014
AN INTERNAL EVIDENCE THAT HAS

00:50:51.081 --> 00:50:52.349
PROMPTED THIS DISCUSSION THAT

00:50:52.416 --> 00:50:54.351
HAS PROMPTED THIS THERE'S A

00:50:54.418 --> 00:50:56.286
HEIGHTENED AWARENESS WITHIN

00:50:56.353 --> 00:50:57.554
THESE DEPARTMENTS AMONG THESE

00:50:57.621 --> 00:51:00.123
OFFICERS THAT THIS IS INDEED A

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:02.426
RISK THAT THIS IS AN ONGOING.

00:51:02.492 --> 00:51:04.194
CHALLENGE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME

00:51:04.261 --> 00:51:07.664
THAT THEIR- IT'S VERY MUCH-

00:51:07.731 --> 00:51:08.598
WHILE THERE'S AN AWARENESS

00:51:08.665 --> 00:51:10.100
THERE IT'S VERY MUCH UP TO

00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:11.835
THESE OFFICES ON THEIR OWN TO

00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:13.570
TAKE A SERIES OF PRECAUTIONS

00:51:13.637 --> 00:51:16.306
AGAINST THE AGAINST THE UV RAYS

00:51:16.373 --> 00:51:18.508
SELL- CLEARLY THERE'S A LOT OF

00:51:18.575 --> 00:51:19.676
WORK TO BE DONE IN THIS AREA

00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:22.112
BUT- IT IN MY WAY OF THINKING

00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:24.347
IT JUST STANDS TO REASON. THAT

00:51:24.414 --> 00:51:26.616
THIS HEIGHTENED RISK OF HAS LED

00:51:26.683 --> 00:51:28.218
TO THIS BILL BUT AGAIN I DO

00:51:28.285 --> 00:51:29.386
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS

00:51:29.453 --> 00:51:31.588
BASED IN SCIENCE AS THE CHAIR

00:51:31.655 --> 00:51:33.657
IS INDICATED AS I'VE INDICATED

00:51:33.723 --> 00:51:35.525
OF AND WE WILL NOT MOVE FORWARD

00:51:35.592 --> 00:51:38.829
UNLESS THE SCIENCE BACKS UP.

00:51:38.895 --> 00:51:43.700

AFFECTION FOR AFFECTED BY THEIR

00:51:53.543 --> 00:51:55.345
THEIR WORK THAT THEY SHOULD BE

00:51:55.412 --> 00:51:57.547
COVERED ABSOLUTELY I'VE BEEN A

00:51:57.614 --> 00:51:59.983
HUNTER FOR FIFTY ONE YEARS AND

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.185
HAVE HAD GREAT EXPERIENCES IN

00:52:02.252 --> 00:52:04.754
THE OUTDOORS BECAUSE OF THIS

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:07.591
AGENCY. WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS.

00:52:07.657 --> 00:52:11.695
HOW PROACTIVE IN OUR ROLE AS

00:52:11.761 --> 00:52:13.296
OVERSIGHT OF THIS AGENCY CAN WE

00:52:13.363 --> 00:52:15.098
MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING

00:52:15.165 --> 00:52:18.168
EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO PROTECT

00:52:18.235 --> 00:52:20.170
THESE PUBLIC SERVICE.

00:52:20.237 --> 00:52:21.872
ADMINISTRATOR I MISS CHAIR IF I

00:52:24.307 --> 00:52:26.343
DIRECTLY ADDRESSED- THAT

00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:27.511
QUESTION MY UNDERSTANDING IS

00:52:27.577 --> 00:52:29.145
THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE FOR THE

00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:31.248
BASIC THINGS LIKE HATS BUT IT

00:52:31.314 --> 00:52:34.017
HITS REALLY VERY MUCH A TO THE

00:52:34.084 --> 00:52:35.552
WORKERS THEMSELVES FOR CERTAIN

00:52:35.619 --> 00:52:36.953
PROTECTIONS BUT PAT DO YOU HAVE

00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:38.889
A AN ADDITIONAL ANSWER ON THAT.

00:52:38.955 --> 00:52:39.890
I CAN TELL YOU THAT OUR UNIFORM

00:52:39.956 --> 00:52:41.558
POLICY ON COURSE AUTHORIZES

00:52:41.625 --> 00:52:43.193
LONG SLEEVES WHICH MANY OF US

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:44.628
I'VE BEEN WEARING LONG SLEEVES

00:52:44.694 --> 00:52:46.630
FOR OUTDOOR WORK FOR YEARS NOW.

00:52:46.696 --> 00:52:48.665
ADD I CERTAINLY HATS- BUT

00:52:48.732 --> 00:52:50.467
SUNSCREEN IS REALLY THE PRIMARY

00:52:50.534 --> 00:52:51.768
TOOL WE HAVE BUT THE PROBLEM

00:52:51.835 --> 00:52:53.436
WITH SUNSCREEN IS THAT SALT

00:52:53.503 --> 00:52:57.107
SPRAY- JUST DIRT GRIME SWEAT-

00:52:57.173 --> 00:52:58.441
WEARING LONG SLEEVES IN THE

00:52:58.508 --> 00:53:00.510
HEAT OF SUMMER IS IT JUST

00:53:00.577 --> 00:53:01.678
MISERABLY UNCOMFORTABLE AND

00:53:01.745 --> 00:53:03.013
THEN IT WASHES OFF IT GETS

00:53:03.079 --> 00:53:04.281
WASHED UP WITH THE DIRT AND

00:53:04.347 --> 00:53:05.849
SWEAT. AND DEFINITELY THE SALT

00:53:05.916 --> 00:53:07.851
SPRAY SO IT'S JUST IT'S

00:53:07.918 --> 00:53:09.719
SOMETHING THAT WE ALL ARE AWARE

00:53:09.786 --> 00:53:11.555
OF THE DEPARTMENT DOES. THEY

00:53:11.621 --> 00:53:13.156
MAKE SURE WE ARE AWARE OF THAT

00:53:13.223 --> 00:53:14.257
AUTHORIZING THE HATS

00:53:14.324 --> 00:53:17.894
AUTHORIZING LONG SLEEVES BUT IT

00:53:17.961 --> 00:53:20.931
