WE'RE A CALL TO ORDER THE JOINT OVERSIGHT HEARING OF THE LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE THE ASSEMBLY HEALTH COMMITTEE. THIS AFTERNOON WE WILL DISCUSS THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE AUDITOR AND THE ON REPORT RELEASED IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR TITLE DEPARTMENT. OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES MILLIONS OF CHILDREN AND MEDICAL CARE MEDI CAL. ARE NOT RECEIVING PREVENTATIVE HEALTH SERVICES WE WILL ALSO DISCUSS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES PLANS. TO ACTIONS THAT WOULD. HELP CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN RECEIVE PREVENTATIVE HEALTH SERVICES. NEARLY HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN ABOUT FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION RECEIVE MEDICARE -- MEDIC MEDICAL CARE THROUGH BETTER CAL UNFORTUNATELY I FOUND THAT MILLIONS OF CHILDREN ROLLED AND MEDICARE I'VE NOT RECEIVED ALL REQUIRED PREVENTIVE HEALTH SERVICES. IN FACT CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTIETH FOR ALL STATES A PROVIDING PREVENTATIVE HEALTH SERVICES TO CHILDREN COVERED BY MEDICARE. THESE PREVENTIVE HEALTH SERVICES INCLUDING DEVELOPMENTAL HEALTH SCREENINGS IMMUNIZATIONS. AND LEAD RISK ASSESSMENT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN RECEIVE EARLY DETECTION AND CARE SO THAT HEALTH. PROBLEMS ARE VERDADE OR DIAGNOSED AND TREATED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. ONE KEY REASON THAT CHILDREN DO NOT RECEIVE PREVENTIVE SERVICES IS THAT IN MANY PARTS OF THE STATE. ACCESS TO PROVIDERS WHO TREAT CHILDREN IN MEDI CAL IS LIMITED. ANOTHER BARRIER TO CHILDREN RECEIVING PREVENTED OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES. AND ADEQUATE OVERSIGHT OF THE MANAGED CARE PLANS THROUGH WHICH OUR WORLD. CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH SYSTEM IS FACING A CRISIS WITH MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST THOSE. WITH MEDI CAL STRUGGLING TO ACCESS CARE THAT THEY NEED. A RECENT REPORT BY THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION HIGHLIGHTED A KEY PROBLEM. WORKFORCE SHORTAGES CALIFORNIANS I HAVE ENOUGH OF THE RIGHT TYPES OF HEALTH WORKERS IN THE RIGHT PLACES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE GROWING AGING. AND INCREASINGLY DIVERSE POPULATION. MANY COUNTIES PARTICULARLY THOSE IN THE RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE. INCLUDING THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY ARE EXPERIENCING SHORTFALLS OF PRIMARY CARE. DENTAL CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. FOR EXAMPLE THE COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION RECOMMEND SIXTY TO EIGHTY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS PER. ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION BUT THE STATEWIDE AVERAGES ONLY. FIFTY THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER. AND UNDERSERVED REGIONS LIKE THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND THE INLAND EMPIRE WE'RE THEIR ONLY THIRTY NINE AND THIRTY FIVE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND POPULATION. THE CALIFORNIA FUTURE HEALTH WORKFORCE COMMISSION CONCLUDED THAT SEVERAL KEY VALUES LONG STANDING HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGES. HAVE CONTRIBUTED SUBSTANTIALLY TO ITS POOR HEALTH CARE. IN FACT ACCORDING TO A TWENTY FOURTEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN STUDY RANKING HEALTH OUTCOMES IN CALIFORNIA ALL SIX SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY COUNTIES. RANKED IN THE BOTTOM THIRD OF THE STATE. WE KNOW THAT THESE NUMBERS ARE EXACERBATED DEPENDING ON THE STUDY THAT YOU LOOK AT I BELIEVE YOU CASF HAS A STUDY OUT THERE. WERE THESE NUMBERS EVEN SHOW GREATER DISPARITIES. AS WE KNOW THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT ONLY AFFECTS RULE AREAS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BUT THIS IS A STATE WIDE PROBLEM. I KNOW ONE OF THE GOVERNOR'S FOLKS IS ENSURING THAT ALL CHILDREN HAVE AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE. PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT ARE ENROLLED IN MEDICARE. THE LEGISLATURE ALSO ALSO SHARES THE GOVERNOR'S NAME. FOR TODAY I LOOK FORWARD TO A PRODUCTIVE AND ROBUST DISCUSSION REGARDING THE AUTO REPORT AND WHAT THE DEPARTMENT IS DOING TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO CARE. AND MOUNT ALSO INTERESTED TO HEAR FROM THE STAKEHOLDERS ON THE REACTION TO THE AUDIT AND ANY PROPOSALS THEY MAY HAVE. TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES RAISED I AM PLEASED -- TO MAKE NOTE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S. INITIAL BUDGET. DID SHOW THAT PROPOSITION SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS WILL BE -- MOVE TOWARDS A SANTA NINE OO MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AS WE BEGIN THAT BUDGET DELIBERATIONS. FOR LOOKING AT SAYING HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THESE ACCESS OUTCOMES WITH THAT -- I'LL TURN THIS OVER. TO THE CHAIR OF THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WHAT. GREAT WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS -- I WILL REPEAT A LOT OF WHAT HE SAID -- BUT I WHAT I DO WANT TO SAY THIS WHEN I REQUESTED THE THIS AUDIT LAST YEAR ONE UNDERSTAND HOW WELL. THE PROGRAM IS FULFILLING ITS MANDATE TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN AND ROLLED MEDI CAL RECEIVE TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE AND PREVENTIVE CARE SERVICES FOR WHICH THERE ELIGIBLE UNDER THE EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT PROGRAM -- WE WILL HEAR TODAY THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THAT AUDITHAVE A FULL AGENDA WE'VE GOT MUCH TO HEAR AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE TESTIMONY. THAT I THINK WILL BRING UP OUR FIRST PANEL YES. SO THANK YOU LOOKS GOOD AND BEGIN WITH THE AGENDA ITEM NUMBER TWO OVERVIEW OF FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR WITH US -- WE HAVE OUR STATE AUDITOR ELAINE HOW. AND I BELIEVE SHE IS COMPANY BY MR JOSH -- HOOPER I DON'T SUPERVISOR WITH CALIFORNIA SEA OTTER. SO PLEASE BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CAIR -- CHAIRMAN WOULD CHAIRMAN SALAS FOR THE RECORD MY NAME TO LINE HOW ON THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR THE SERGEANTS HANDING OUT. A DOCUMENT THAT'LL BE REFERRING TO WHEN I GO THROUGH MY COMMENTS MISTER HOOPER WILL BE -- GOING OVER THE LEGISLATIVE AND RECORD THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES I'LL GO THROUGH THE KEY ISSUES -- AT A FAIRLY HIGH LEVEL OF OF THE VARIETY OF CONCERNS WE IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT AND THEN WILL STEP THROUGH THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS SO. AS YOU MENTIONED MISTER CHAIRMAN NEARLY HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN. RECEIVE MEDICAL SERVICES THROUGH MEDI CAL -- IN 90% OF THOSE CHILDREN RECEIVE IT THROUGH MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THAT WAS% REALLY THE FOCUS OF THIS PARTICULAR AUDIT REPORT AND REQUEST BY BY MISTER WOOD. AS YOU ALSO MENTIONED IN YOUR COMMENT UTILIZATION RATES IN CALIFORNIA RANKING RELATIVELY LOW ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHERE WE RANK FORTY S. ACCORDING TO A STUDY THAT WAS DONE BACK IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN UTILIZATION RATES OVER THE FIVE YEAR WINDOW THAT WE LOOKED AT WAS WHICH WAS FISCAL YEAR. TWELVE THIRTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN IT RANGED BETWEEN FORTY EIGHT AND 50% SO STILL A LOW PERCENTAGE -- UTILIZATION RATE FOR CALIFORNIA CHILDREN -- WHAT THAT EQUATES TO FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE IN MEDI CAL IS ON AVERAGE THERE ARE TWO POINT FOUR MILLION CHILDREN AT ANY PARTICULAR YEAR LOSS FIVE YEARS THAT WE LOOKED AT? COR NOT RECEIVING ALL PREVENTIVE SERVICES SOME OF THOSE CHILDREN MAY NOT BE RECEIVING ANY SERVICES SOME OF THOSE CHILDREN MAY READ BE RECEIVING SOME SERVICES BUT CERTAINLY NOT THE FULL BREADTH. OF SERVICES ARE PREVENTIVE SERVICES THAT ARE BENEFICIAL TO CHILDREN -- AS YOU. IF YOU COULD TURN TO PAGE TWO ON THE HAND OUT WE HAVE A MAP THAT IS SHOWN IN THE AUDIT REPORT WE WE HAVE JUST A FEW GRAPHICS THAT ARE EXCERPTS FROM THE PORCH WHAT THIS GRAPH SHOWS YOUR THIS PICTURE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS THE UTILIZATION RATES BY COUNTY AND AS YOU CAN SEE. EASTERN A CALIFORNIA RURAL COUNTIES REALLY HAVE A MUCH LOWER UTILIZATION RATE -- THEN COUNTIES AND MORE URBAN AREAS COASTAL AREAS IT'S CENTER BUT STILL THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT -- ISSUES WITH RESPECT UTILIZATION THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WHY IS THAT WE WERE LOOKING TO DETERMINE ACCESS TO CARE SO A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT WE LOOKED AT WITH RESPECT -- TO ACCESSIBILITY AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AFTER GUIDANCE CAME OUT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED TIME AND DISTANCE STANDARDS SPECIFIC STANDARDS THAT A MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE NETWORKS ARE SUPPOSED. TO MEET THAT ARE SHOWN ON PAGE THREE OF YOUR HAND OUT IT'S A TABLE THAT THAT BASICALLY LAYS OUT FOR PRIMARY CARE IT USUALLY WITHIN TEN MILES OR THIRTY MINUTES. FOR A A BENEFICIARY HAVE TO TRAVEL TO GET CARE. THROUGH MANTA THROUGH A MANAGED CARE PLAN OR A NETWORK -- WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT CERTAINLY DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES PUT THAT THE THE THOSE -- STANDARDS OUT THERE FOR PROVIDERS TO TO TRY TO MEET -- BUT THERE WAS ALSO STATE LAW THAT ALLOWED PROVIDERS MANAGED CARE PLANS EXCUSE ME TO SEEK EXCEPTIONS TO THAT PARTICULAR STANDARD. ARMS AND AND WHAT WE SAW AND I THINK HEALTH CARE SERVICES WOULD WOULD. TESTIFY TO THEY WERE QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE THEY GOT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF REQUEST FOR EXCEPTIONS IT WAS UPWARDS OF EIGHTY THOUSAND MANY OF THOSE WERE IN COMPLETE SO THEY THEY WEREN'T REALLY EVEN CONSIDERED. BUT DEPARTMENT OF CARE SERVICES APPROVED NEARLY TEN THOUSAND OF THESE EXCEPTIONS THAT PLANS ASKED. FOR AS FAR AS WE CAN'T MEET THAT PARTICULAR STANDARD WE HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARD THAT WE WOULD LIKE THE DEPARTMENT TO APPROVE -- AND OF THOSE TEN THOUSAND THE DEPARTMENT APPROVED ABOUT. SIXTY EIGHT HUNDRED WITH RESPECT TO PROVIDERS WHO ARE PROVIDING SERVICES FOR CHILDREN SO YOU'RE YOU'RE LOOKING AT ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY MEET. THE ONES THAT WERE ESTABLISHED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN CERTAINLY A PROCESS THAT THAT WAS YOU KNOW AUTHORIZED IN LAW BUT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THOSE ACCESS STANDARDS THAT. FOR WHICH THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS NOW THE CONCERN WE IDENTIFIED IN THE REPORT -- IS THAT SOME OF THESE. ALTERNATIVE STANDARDS WERE VERY EXTREME AN EXCESSIVE OFF FOR PARTICULAR TYPES OF SPECIALTIES OR EVEN FOR PRIMARY CARE WHERE BENEFICIARIES WOULD BE EXPECTED TO TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILES -- POTENTIALLY HOURS JUST TO GET TO A PARTICULAR -- PROVIDER TO GET CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND SO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WAS REALLY FOCUSING ON DID THE PLAN. DO ITS DUE DILIGENCE IN TRYING TO FIND PROVIDERS THAT COULD -- PROVIDE SERVICES TO THESE CHILDREN WITHIN THE EGG THE THE TYPICAL STANDARDS THAT THAT -- THIRTY MINUTES TEN MILES IF THEY COULDN'T DO THAT THEN DID THEY PUT TOGETHER -- A PROPOSAL THAT SEEMED REASONABLE -- THAT MET THE REQUIREMENTS BUT AND I CORRECT MYSELF THE REASONABLENESS SO THEY WEREN'T REALLY LOOKING TO SEE OKAY THEY PROPOSED AN ALTERNATIVE STANDARD THAT. WE HAVE TO DRIVE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES TO TAKE MY CHILD TO A PARTICULAR SPECIALIST IS THAT REASONABLE THAT THAT WASN'T REALLY THE FOCUS OF THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES. DECISION MAKING WHEN APPROVING SOME OF THESE ALTERNATIVE STANDARDS SO EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE PROVED AGAIN AND AND BENEFICIARY WHO'S IN MEDI CAL. GETTING SERVICES FROM PROVIDERS ARE TYPICALLY LOW INCOME FAMILIES THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DRIVE THREE HUNDRED MILES OR THEY MAY HAVE MAY NOT HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO DO THAT. SO UNFORTUNATELY MANY OF THOSE CHILDREN ARE NOT GETTING ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED -- THE OTHER THE OTHER ISSUE WE HAD WITH RESPECT TO THIS IS THERE ARE CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE. A PLAN WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ALLOW THAT BEEN IF YOU SHARE IN THAT CHILD TO SEEK. CARE FROM A PROVIDER WHO'S OUT OF PLAN SO MAY NOT BE IN THE NETWORK BUT MAYBE MUCH CLOSER THAN WHAT THAT ALTERNATIVE STANDARD IS SUGGESTING MUCH CLOSER THAN THE THREE HUNDRED MILES. THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE -- THE PLAN SHOULD BE ABLE TO AND SHOULD. NOTIFY THOSE BENEFICIARIES WE DON'T HAVE A PROVIDER IN OUR NETWORK BUT WE HAVE ONE CLOSE BY WHERE YOU CAN TAKE YOUR CHILD. AND AND DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES WAS NOT ENSURING THAT THE PLANS WERE NOTIFYING AND LETTING THOSE BENEFICIARIES KNOW THAT YOU DO HAVE OPTIONS. RATHER THAN DRIVING THREADED MILES YOU CAN GET CARE -- CLOSER BY. NOW SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE LOOKED AT WITH RESPECT TO ACCESS TO CARE AND AND MISTER SALAS TALKED ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT IN HIS OPENING COMMENTS IS THE SUPPLIER PROVIDERS. WHY DON'T WE HAVE AS A STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE MORE PROVIDERS -- WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN MEDI CAL -- IN PART OF THE CONCERN NO SURPRISE TO MEMBERS A LEGISLATURE THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES IN CALIFORNIA ARE QUITE LOW SOME OF THE LOWEST IN THE COUNTRY -- THERE ARE ONLY ACCORDING TO A STUDY DONE BY KAISER BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE WERE ONLY TWO OTHER STATES THAT HAVE LOWER REIMBURSEMENT RATES. THAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NOW WE HAVE TO SAY THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS TRYING -- TO HAS DEVELOPED THE RECRUITING PROGRAM AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO TRY TO GET PHYSICIANS. AND PROVIDERS IN CALIFORNIA TO PARTICIPATE IN -- THE MEDI CAL SYSTEM BY PROVIDING SOME TUITION RELIEF -- AND SO THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GOOD STEP FORWARD THEY ALSO BE AN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN USING PROP FIFTY SIX MONEY TO BACK OF TAX MONEY. TO ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR PROVIDERS THE CONCERN WE HAVE WITH THE PROP FIFTY SIX IT'S A GREAT STEP IT'S A GREAT OPTION. BUT THAT FUNDING STREAM IS NOT NECESSARILY A STABLE CONSISTENT RELIABLE FUNDING STREAM SO SOME PROVIDERS MAY BE RELUCTANT. TO PUT AGAIN PARTICIPATE IN MEDI CAL BECAUSE THEY DON'T VIEW THAT AS A A RELIABLE. SOURCE OF FUNDING. I'M ONE OF THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE WE DISCUSSED IN THE REPORT SOME OTHER STATES USE PAY FOR PERFORMANCE -- TO INCENTIVIZE PROVIDERS -- TO PRO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO CHILDREN -- AND TO MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES THEY AREN'T NECESSARILY HOLDING PLANS ACCOUNTABLE THIS IS THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES AGAIN. WE HAVE TO PAY FOR PERFORMANCE AND THE PLANS ARE UNDER PERFORMING THEN WE'VE GOT TO HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO THOSE PARTICULAR EXPECTATIONS. SO THAT FIRST SECTION OF THE REPORT WE TALK ABOUT ACCESS TO CARE UTILIZATION RATES -- THAT THE NEXT STEP THAT WE LOOKED AT IS OKAY WHAT KIND OF GUIDANCE DOES DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROVIDE WHAT TYPES OF OVERSIGHT. ACTIVITIES ARE THEY PERFORMING TO MAKE SURE THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS AND PROVIDERS ARE ACTUALLY PROVIDING SERVICES TO CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT WE FOUND IS. AND WE THANK THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES COULD DO A BETTER JOB OF MAKING CLEAR THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH RESPECT. TO THE TYPES OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE RECEIVING THAT IT'S IT'S A SCHEDULE CALL BRIGHT FUTURE SCHEDULE WHICH LAYS OUT IMMUNIZATION SCREENINGS OTHER TYPES OF SERVICES PREVENTIVE SERVICES THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE RECEIVING THAT PROVIDER SHOULD BE. OFFERING TO BENEFICIARIES -- AND WHAT WE SAW AS A DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES MAY HAVE LAID OUT THOSE EXPECTATIONS BUT THEY WEREN'T CLEAR. NOT ONLY TO THEIR PLANS BUT ARE NOT CLEAR TO THE PROVIDERS SO THERE NEEDS TO BE A BETTER JOB OF INFORMING BOTH PLANS AND PROVIDERS AND WHAT IS EXPECTED -- WITH RESPECT TO SERVICES FOR CHILDREN THROUGH THIS BRIGHT FUTURES -- SCHEDULE. IN ADDITION THERE IS A REPAIR THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENT THAT THE STATE HAS TO ANNUALLY AND FORM FAMILIES OF CHILDREN WHO HAVEN'T USED. EARLY PERIODIC SCREENING -- E. P. S. T. D. T. R. SCREENING DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT IF IF THERE ARE BENEFICIARIES IN THE MEDICAL SYSTEM THAT ARE NOT AVAILING THEMSELVES OF THOSE TYPES OF SERVICES THERE'S A RESPONSIBILITY ON THE STATE. TO INFORM FAMILIES THAT THESE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO YOU AND THAT YOUR CHILDREN SHOULD BE ABLE TO TO GAIN ACCESS TO THOSE PARTICULAR SERVICES SO THE STATE IS NOT DOING A GOOD JOB. OF MAKING SURE THAT THAT IS BEING COMMUNICATED TO BENEFICIARIES WHEN WE TALK TO THE DEPARTMENT THEY SAID WELL WE'RE DEFERRING TO THE PLANS TO INFORM THE BENEFICIARIES WELL WE TALKED TO SOME OF THE PLANS DURING THE COURSE OF THE AUDIT. AND NONE OF THE PLANS THAT WE SPOKE WITH ACTUALLY ARE DOING THAT MAY CAN SURE THAT BENEFICIARIES ARE AWARE. OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO THEM. NOW ONE THING WE DID FIND THAT WE THINK IS -- INDICATIVE OF AWAY THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES ARE THE STATE CAN ACTUALLY INCREASE UTILIZATION RATES ON PAGE FOUR OF THE HAND OUT THERE IS A GRAPHIC THAT WE HAD IN THE AUDIT REPORT. THAT REALLY DEMONSTRATES AS YOU CAN SEE AGES THREE THROUGH SIX WHERE WE PUT A BOX AROUND THOSE AGES. THOSE ARE SPECIFIC AGE GROUPS WHERE THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES. REALLY EXPECTS AND THEY HAVE DEVELOPED PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR MANAGED CARE PLANS TO MEET AND TO REPORT ON SO WHEN THINGS ARE BEING MEASURED ACTIVITY IS IS HAPPENING. SO YOU CAN SEE THE UTILIZATION RATES FOR CHILDREN IN THOSE AGE GROUPS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN MOST OF THE OTHER AGE GROUPS ACROSS THAT SCALE -- CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME THERE PARTICULARLY LOW AGE -- TO VERY VERY LOW BUT BUT THE METRICS AND IF YOU LOOK ON PAGE FIVE THIS IS A TABLE THAT SHOWS. THE VARIOUS TYPES OF SERVICES THROUGH BRIGHT FUTURES I WAS REFERRING TO AND YOU CAN SEE THE COLUMN THAT HAS THREE TO SIX YEARS. THEY ARE CHECKING THEY HAVE ESTABLISHED PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THAT AGE GROUP FOR ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SERVICES AND IN AND LOOKING BACK ON THE ON THE GRAPH THE PRIOR PAGE YOU CAN SEE THE UTILIZATION RATES. FOR THOSE PARTICULAR CHILDREN ARE MUCH MUCH HIGHER -- THAN ANY OF THE OTHER AGES -- ZERO THROUGH THROUGH. TWENTY SO WHAT THAT DEMONSTRATES IS IF YOU ESTABLISH THE METRICS AND YOU HOLD PLANS ACCOUNTABLE THEY AND PROVIDERS WILL PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO LOOKED AT ANNUAL AUDITS THAT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES CONDUCTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT PLANS ACTUALLY HAVE THE UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PROGRAM -- MANY OF THE PLANS DO BUT WHAT HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS NOT INSURING. IS THAT WHETHER OR NOT THESE PLANS ARE TAKING THE ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED SO THEY HAVE A UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT PLAN THEY WANT TO INCREASE. ACCESS TO CARE THEY WANT TO INCREASE UTILIZATION HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS NOT HOLDING THOSE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO WHAT SPECIFICALLY ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO ADDRESS THE LOW UTILIZATION RATES THAT YOU'RE PROVIDERS. ARE YOUR DATA DEMONSTRATES. IN ADDITION RELATED TO EARLY PERIODIC SCREENING -- SERVICES FOR CHILDREN D. D. H. U. S. HEALTHCARE SERVICES JUST BEGAN AUDITING AND LOOKING AT THOSE TYPES OF SERVICES JUST LAST FALL FALL OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN BUT AGAIN WE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE PROCEDURES THEY'RE REVIEWING A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF THE SERVICE IS NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING AT ALL. OF THEM AND LOOKING AT A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF CHILDREN SO WE THINK THEY NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB -- IN CONDUCTING THAT WORK AS WELL SO REALLY TRYING TO HOLD PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO TRY TO GET THEM. TO INCREASE PROVIDE SERVICES AN INCREASE UTILIZATION RATES FOR CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA. A COUPLE OF OTHER ISSUES RELATED TO ACCESS AND PROVISION OF SERVICES -- ANOTHER QUESTION THAT MR WOOD HAD WAS RELATED TO CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC NEEDS SO WHAT ARE THE PLANS DOING TO MAKE SURE THAT BENEFICIARIES WHO SPEAK A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE -- ARE FROM A DIFFERENT CULTURE REALLY UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF BRIGHT FUTURES THE AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES THE AND THE THE ELIGIBILITY THAT THEIR CHILDREN HAVE TO PROVIDE THESE TO RECEIVE EXCUSE ME THESE VARIOUS TYPES OF SCREENINGS IMMUNIZATIONS AT CETERA. AND EVEN THOUGH THE PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP REPORT EVERY FIVE YEARS AND LOOKING AT YOU KNOW CULTURAL -- ISSUES AND LANGUAGE ISSUES THEY ARE AGAIN NOT ENSURING THAT THE PLANS ARE TAKING ACT. ACTION TO ADDRESS ANY OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND WE HAVE SOME GRAPHICS IN THE REPORT TO SHOW OF UP A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. YOU KNOW CANTONESE SPEAKING INDIVIDUALS AND RUSSIAN SPEAKERS OR OR SO HISPANIC -- INDIVIDUAL SPEAKING SPANISH IN CALIFORNIA SO THEY HAVE THE DATA BUT THE PLANS ARE REALLY NOT FOLLOWING UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING ANYTHING ABOUT. THOSE PARTICULAR. BENEFICIARIES WHO MAY HAVE A LANGUAGE BARRIER AGAIN THEY'RE RELYING ON THE PROVIDER -- TO EITHER PROVIDE LANGUAGE SERVICES OR THEY'RE EXPECTING THE BENEFICIARIES TO ASK FOR A TRANSLATION -- TRANSLATOR SOMEONE TO ASSIST SO THERE AND WHAT THE STATE IS NOT REALLY BEING PROACTIVE IN MAKING SURE THAT PLAN AND AND PROVIDERS ARE ARE ADDRESSING THOSE THOSE CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC NEEDS. THE LAST SECTION OF THE REPORT TALKS ABOUT SOME INCENTIVES -- WE LOOKED AT SOME OTHER STATES THAT ACTUALLY HAVE SOME INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT WE THOUGHT MIGHT BE BENEFICIAL TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE THINK THAT DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES. SHOULD LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE ONE OF THOSE IS IS A STATE THAT INCLUDES -- THE BRIGHT FUTURE SCHEDULE AND SOME OF THE PAMPHLETS OR THE INFORMATION THAT'S PROVIDED TO BENEFICIARIES SO THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT INCENTIVES THAT WE THINK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD LOOK AT I'M IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE'S A REVIEWS THAT ARE DONE BY AN EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW. TEAM IT'S A REQUIREMENT AND THEY THEY LOOK AT ACCESS TO CARE THEY LOOK AT QUALITY OF CARE WHAT WE FOUND IS THOSE REVIEWS ARE BEING DONE BUT AGAIN THE FOLLOW UP ISN'T HAPPENING TO MAKE SURE THAT. ANY ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THOSE REVIEWS ARE BEING ADDRESSED AND HOPEFULLY RESOLVED SO WE CAN GET THE UTILIZATION RATES UP -- AND HAVE CHILDREN GET ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE CARE THAT THEY NEED. SO THAT IS A KIND OF AA QUICK OVERVIEW OF OF THE ISSUES THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THERE AND THE AUDIT REPORT WHAT MISTER HOOPER IS GOING TO DO IS THE FIRST PAGE OF THE HANDOUT HE'S GONNA STEP YOU THROUGH WE HAD SOME SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE TO THE LEGISLATURE. AND THEN SOMEBODY ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE TO THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES. THANK YOU MISS OUT [inaudible] OKAY -- AS THE STATE AUDITOR SAID WE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL ISSUES IN THE REPORT -- AND WE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES -- WE HAVE A SUMMARY OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS ON PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT. WE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS TO BOTH OF THE LEGISLATURE AND TO DH CS. WE MADE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE. THE FIRST ADDRESSES THE ACCESS ISSUE. BY REQUIRING DH CS TO MODIFY THE CRITERIA THAT IT USES FOR APPROVING ITS ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS. TO CONSIDER THE REASON ABILITY OF THOSE -- OF THOSE ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS. THEN IF A PLAN IS UNABLE TO MEET -- REASONABLE ACCESS STANDARDS. TO REQUIRE THOSE PLANS TO ALLOW OUT OF NETWORK ACCESS. NOT ONLY THAT BUT THE A DH CS SHOULD REQUIRE THOSE PLANS TO INFORM THE MEMBERS THAT ARE AFFECTED THAT THEY CAN ACCESS THESE OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS. AND IT SHOULD REQUIRE THE PROVIDER OR THE PLANTS THEMSELVES TO ASSIST MEMBER OUR MEMBERS IN. IN FINDING THOSE PROVIDERS. OUR SECOND LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATION ADDRESSES THE REIMBURSEMENT RATES ISSUE. BY HAVING BY DIRECTING DH CS IMPLEMENT A PAY FOR PERFORMANCE PROGRAM THAT SPECIFICALLY TARGETS THE UTILIZATION CHILDREN'S PREVENTIVE SERVICES. TO THE EXTENT THAT. DHS CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING. IT SHOULD I'D ASK THE LEGISLATURE TO INCREASE FUNDING SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT PURPOSE. WE ALSO HAD RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. OUR FIRST RECOMMENDATION IN THE SUMMARIES -- TO I'D USE THE TOOLS THAT DH CS ALREADY HAS THIS WITH THE BY THE TIME WE ACCESS STUDY. AND THE THE DATA THAT IS COLLECTED FROM THOSE ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS REQUESTS TO IDENTIFY AREAS IN THE STATE. WHERE IT SHOULD TARGET ITS RECRUITING EFFORTS AND AS THE STATE AUDITOR SAID? DTS IS ALREADY WORKING USING PROPS FIFTY SIX FUNDING OF FOR SOME RECRUITMENT EFFORTS. BUT THOSE RECRUITMENT EFFORTS ARE. NOT TARGETED TO CHILDREN'S PREVENTIVE SERVICES -- AND THEY AREN'T UTILIZING -- CONSISTENT LONG TERM FUNDING SOURCE. THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION TO TAKE PART IN OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- IS THAT IT SHOULD UTILIZED -- PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR ALL AGE GROUPS AND NOT JUST THOSE SPECIFIC AGE GROUPS THAT WE SAW -- ON PAGE FOUR OF THE HAND OUT THERE. WE'VE SEEN THAT THE I PERFORMANCE MEASURES WHAT YOU MEASURE IS WHAT GETS IMPROVED AND SO SINCE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN INCREASED UTILIZATION AND THOSE PERFORMANCE MEASURES WE RECOMMENDED THAT DH CS IMPLEMENT THOSE PERFORMANCE MEASURES. FOR CHILDREN OF ALL AGES. WE'VE ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT DH CS SHOULD EXPANDED IT'S AUDIT PROCEDURES IN ITS ANNUAL MEDICAL AUDITS TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET CHILDREN'S PREVENTIVE SERVICES CONSISTENTLY AND FOR ALL CHILDREN. WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. SHOULD UTILIZE THE PROVIDER DIRECTORY SYSTEM. WHICH CURRENTLY IT IT -- CURRENTLY IT'S VALIDATION PROCESS FOR THOSE PROVIDER DIRECTORIES IS LACKING. DH CS WILL -- WILL APPROVE A AND PLANTS PROVIDER DIRECTORY WITH -- A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF ERRORS IN IT AND UTILIZING A LOW CONFIDENCE RATE. WE RECOMMENDED THAT IT INCREASE THE CONFIDENCE INTERVAL. MAINTAIN ITS -- MARGIN OF ERROR AND INCREASE THE ACCURACY -- SO THAT DH CS CAN. ADDRESS ACCESS FOR THESE FAMILIES. IN A METHOD THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE THE ADDITION OF A SINGLE NEW PROVIDER. WE'VE ALSO RECOMMENDED THE DH CS WOULD REQUIRE PLANS TO TAKE ACTION TO ADDRESS THE FINDINGS IN ITS GROUP NEEDS ASSESSMENTS THESE ARE THE THE END OF THE A PERIODIC -- ASSESSMENTS THAT PLANS TO TO ADDRESS CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC NEEDS -- WE KNOW THAT THESE THESE REPORTS ARE BEING CONDUCTED THE STUDIES ARE BEING CONDUCTED BUT THE OUR RECOMMENDATION IS FOR DHS TO HOLD THE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO ADDRESS WHAT IT'S FINDING IN THOSE. ASSESSMENTS. THAT OUR LAST RECOMMENDATION ON THE SUMMARIES FOR DH CS. TO MONITOR AND IDENTIFY THE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT PLANTS ARE DOING AT THE PLAN LEVEL. TO IDENTIFY THOSE THAT ARE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND THEN TO SHARE THE RESULTS OF THOSE -- OF THOSE PROGRAMS WITH ALL THE PLANTS. SO THAT CONCLUDES MY TEST ON WE'RE OPEN TO QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION AND APPRECIATE THE WORK ON THE AUDIT -- SO I I DO HAVE SOME SOME KIND OF BASIC QUESTIONS SO -- BIGGEST IN YOUR OPINION WAS YOU FEEL LIKE THE ACS IS YOU KNOW. LIVING UP TO THE STAND IT LIVING UP TO THE ALTER OF ACCESS STANDARDS AS THEY ARE OTHERS AS THEIR PRESCRIBED. WELL I I WITH RESPECT TO THE ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARDS THE CONCERN THAT WE HAD IN THAT WE RAISED IN THE REPORT IS. THERE THEIR FOCUS WAS PRIMARILY ON WHETHER OR NOT A PARTICULAR PLAN DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY MADE EFFORTS TO FIND PROVIDERS. BUT THEN WHEN THEY APPROVE THE ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARD AS WE SHOW IN THE REPORT SOME OF THOSE ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS ARE REQUIRING BENEFICIARIES AS I SAID TO TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF MILES SO. THERE NEEDS TO BE -- A DIFFERENT FOCUS SO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLAN. CONDUCTED EFFORTS ARE DID IS DUE DILIGENCE IN TRYING TO IDENTIFY A PROVIDER WITHIN ITS OWN NETWORK. BUT THEN REALLY LOOK AT THE REASONABLENESS OF THE ALTERNATIVE THAT THAT PARTICULAR PLAN IS SUGGESTING. KEEPING IN MIND WHO THEIR THEY BENEFICIARIES ARE AND THEN MAKE A DETERMINATION NO THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT A REASONABLE STANDARD AS AN ALTERNATIVE WE WE YOU KNOW WE KNOW YOU DID YOU DUE DILIGENCE. BUT YOU'VE COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE THAT STILL IS NOT REASONABLE FOR BENEFICIARIES IN CALIFORNIA THEREFORE -- PART OF IT IS OUR RECOMMENDATION TO ALLOW OUT OF PLAN BUT ALSO WE DIDN'T REALLY SEE PLANS. INFORMING BENEFICIARIES THAT YOU KNOW IF THIS IS JUST TOO ARDUOUS TO TAKE YOUR CHILD THREE HUNDRED MILES FOR SERVICE THEN WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO GO TO WIN. AN OUT OF PLAN PROVIDER SO -- IN A NUT SHELL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IS I THINK DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES NEEDS TO DO MORE WITH RESPECT TO ALTERNATE ACCESS STANDARDS AND NEEDS TO BE HAVE. A MORE STRINGENT ANALYSIS OF THOSE ALTERNATIVES THAT PLANS ARE SUGGESTING. SO YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE LIKE I BELIEVE SIXTY EIGHT HUNDRED THAT WERE APPROVED. HOW MANY OF THOSE WERE FOR PRIMARY CARE? TEAMS OF THE HEAD. I DON'T HAVE I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER OF PRIMARY CARE BUT I KNOW THAT THE 70% OF THE TEN THOUSAND THAT WERE APPROVED FOR SPECIFIC -- TO PROVIDERS FOR CHILDREN -- SO SOME OF THOSE WERE PRIMARY CARE AND SOME OF THOSE WERE SPECIALISTS I CAN GET YOU THOSE EXACT NUMBERS I GUESS WHAT I'M I GUESS WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS THAT YOU KNOW I I I KNOW THAT THERE ARE PRIMARY CARE COMMUNITY. PROVIDERS IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY COMMUNITY OUT THERE. SO IF IF THERE'S REQUEST FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS FOR PEOPLE HAVE TO GO LONG DISTANCES. I KIND OF WANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH OF THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE THAT THAT ISN'T THAT IS AN UNACCEPTABLE BURDEN I BELIEVE. AND SO YOU KNOW IN THE IN THE CASES YOU KNOW. THE STATE YOU KNOW IF STATE LAW PREVENT PER PERMITS BENEFICIARIES TO GO OUT OF NETWORK YOU KNOW. COULD SHOULD THAT BE HAPPENING SO THAT SOMEONE DOESN'T HAVE TO TRUCK TRAVEL IN IN SOME CASES MAYBE IS ONLY A HUNDRED FIFTY MILES BUT UNDER FIFTY MILES IN MY DISTRICT. AS AN ADVENTURE RIGHT -- AND AND THAT'S AND I THINK THAT'S ENOUGH I THINK THAT'S AN ONEROUS BURDEN ON ON PEOPLE. ESPECIALLY PEOPLE WHO ARE --FOR A QUALIFIED FOR THE SERVICES -- SO -- THERE SEEM TO BE -- QUITE VARIATION IN THE NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS BY PLAN -- IT DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON ON THAT YEAH WE FOUND THAT THAT WHEN YOU TOOK THE TOTAL POPULATION OF PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS IN THE STATE. AND AND YOU DIDN'T ISOLATE DIDN'T HOLD PEOPLE SPECIFIC TO ONE PLAN THAT THERE IS A GREATLY INCREASED ACCESS SO ALLOWING THIS OUT OF NETWORK ACCESS. REALLY WILL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE -- TO TO MEMBERS ALL ACROSS THE STATE. BUT IT'S NOT. BEING REALLY UTILIZED. THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS WE HAD IN THE REPORT THAT THERE THAT IS AN OPTION BUT IT'S NOT BEING SHARED WITH THE BENEFICIARIES THEY AREN'T BEING INFORMED OF ALL OF THEIR OPTIONS WITH RESPECT. TO GETTING ACCESS TO CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND THEN ALSO DOCTOR WOULD WE WE HAD AS YOU KNOW WHAT TABLE IN THE REPORT WHERE WE WERE LOOKING AT UTILIZATION RATES AND SO THOSE PARTICULAR PLANS THAT HAD VERY LOW UTILIZATION RATES FOR CHILDREN. GETTING PREVENTIVE CARE ARE THE ONES WHO ARE GETTING THE HIGH NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS APPROVED SO THEIR UTILIZATION RATES ARE ALREADY LOW AND NOW YOU'RE EXPECTING A BENEFICIARY. TO TRAVEL YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY HUNDREDSOF MILES TO GET ACCESS TO THAT CARE WHEN. THEY'RE THERE MAY VERY WELL BE A PROVIDER WHO'S OUT OF NETWORK RELATIVELY CLOSE FOR THAT BENEFICIARY. WAS THERE ANY COMMON TO COULD YOU DETECTIVES ARE A COMMON DENOMINATOR IN THOSE REALLY LOW PERFORMING [inaudible] IN THE YEAH I'M SORRY IN THE LOW PERFORMING PLANTS YEAH EXACTLY IS THERE A COMMON DENOMINATOR THERE. WE DID SEE THAT IT WAS MORE COMMON -- IN THE EASTERN PARTS OF THE STATE AND IN RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE -- EVERY EVERY PLAN IN EVERY GEOGRAPHY ESPECIALLY CALIFORNIA'S DIFFERENT -- BUT WE DID SEE SOME COMMONALITIES IS ESPECIALLY THAT HAD TO DO WITH THEM. URBAN VERSUS RURAL AND YOU KNOW WESTERN VERSUS EASTERN. AND THE NORTHERN. A PART OF THE STATE ALSO SHOWED SOME -- SOME STRUGGLING TO MEET THE ACCESS STANDARDS SO -- AS YOU STARTED DOING YOUR AUDIT DID DID DCS SEEM A SURPRISED BY YOUR WEB BY WHAT YOUR QUESTION IN OF YOUR FINDINGS OR WAS IT WAS. NOT AT ALL I THINK DHS IS VERY AWARE -- BUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE ACCESS ISSUE IN THE STATE -- DATE BUT AS THE STATE AUDITOR SAID THERE IS A LOT MORE THAT THEY COULD BE DOING. SO THEY'RE AWARE OF IT BUT THERE WASN'T THEY'RE NOT REALLY PUSHING THE PLANS ARE NOT PUSHING FOR AND ANYTHING TO HAPPEN IT'S BUT THAT'S THEIR AWARE OF IT AND THERE'S THERE'S MORE THAT THEY COULD DO. THAT'S CORRECT YEAH. RIGHT AND AND MISTER WHAT I THINK WHAT WE WITH THE SCENE IN THE REPORT IS THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAVE REALLY DELEGATED A LOT OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. TO THE PLANTS TO MAKE SURE THE PROVIDERS AND THE BENEFICIARIES ARE INFORMED OF EXPECTATIONS. AND ANTI NOT HAPPEN TITLE MAN BUT WHAT BENEFICIARIES WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE AND WHAT OUR CONCLUSION IS IS THAT BERMAN HEALTH CARE SERVICES NEEDS TO STEP UP NOT ONLY GUIDANCE. BUT OVERSIGHT THEY HAVE DEFERRED AND DELEGATED TO MUCH TO THE PLANS AND PROVIDERS THEMSELVES. SO THAT THEY DEFERRED AND DELEGATED SO IS THERE SO THERE REALLY ISN'T ONE SET DELEGATION AND REFERRALS HAPPEN THERE IS IT ISN'T. ISN'T THE OVERSIGHT THAT. THEY'RE NOT FOLLOWING UP TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE THINGS THAT THE ALLIGATOR ARE HAPPENING. SO ACT LIKE SO CONSEQUENTLY BASED ON THE FINDINGS THEY'RE NOT HAPPENING. THAT'S CORRECT THAT'S WHAT WE FOUND SO -- SO RIGHT BEFORE THE AUDIT WAS RELEASED -- DESIST DAC ESTA NELSON NUMBER OF CHANGES RELATING TO PLAN AND PERFORM A PLANNED PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT -- AND MANDATORY FINDS -- DO YOU HAVE THOUGHTS ON THOSE CHANGES AND AND WHERE YOUR SIXTY DAY FOLLOW UP. COMMENT ON THESE CHANGES WE ARE THE SIXTY DAY RESPONSES TO YOU -- I BELIEVE IN A WEEK OKAY OR TWO PRETTY SOON YEAH SO IT AT THAT POINT WE'LL HAVE MORE TO SAY ON THAT. OKAY. GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AS WELL MAYBE I'LL JUST FOLLOW UP ON WHAT -- DOCTOR WOULD WAS TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF MILES THAT. FAMILIES HAVE TO TRAVEL RIGHT AND YOU SAID IN SOME CASES OVER A HUNDRED MILES. YOU KNOW THAT SEEMS -- PRETTY EGREGIOUS SO WAS IT IN YOUR FINDINGS WAS A LACK OF INFORMATION TO THE FAMILIES LETTING THEM KNOW THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY GO TO OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS. SO THAT THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE TRAVELING THIS GREAT DISTANCES. BUT IN IN SOM CASES IT'S NOT INFORMING OF FOLKS THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS -- UP MORE OFTEN -- IT'S NOT INFORMING FAMILIES THAT THEY ACTUALLY. CAN GET HELP GETTING TO THOSE LONG DISTANCES -- BUT IT'S IT'S MORE THAN JUST THE DISTANCE IN THE TRAVEL TIME IT'S IT'S THE TIME OFF WORK AND IT'S THE NO IT'S GETTING THESE FAMILIES. TO TO HAVE A LITTLE. FAITH IN THE SYSTEM -- THAT THAT THIS THAT. ACCESS IS A REAL THING FOR THEM. HI SO IT HAS TO DO WITH INFORMING BUT IT ALSO HAS TO DO WITH. IMPROVING THAT CONDITION THAT HAS LED TO THESE ON REASONABLE STANDARDS. SO WE SAY ACCESS TO HELP WITH THE HELP SUCH AS ONE THERE'S TRANSPORTATION HELP THE DH YESES REQUIRED TO PROVIDE. MR SALAS SIMILAR TO THE THE DISCUSSION WE HAD EARLIER AGAIN THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS REALLY. DELEGATING OR OR YOU KNOW EXPECTING THE PLANS TO INFORM PROVIDERS TO MAKE SURE PROVIDERS ARE INFORMING BENEFICIARIES. AND DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS NOT MAKING SURE THAT PLANS ARE DOING THAT SO THAT. BENEFICIARIES ARE EVEN AWARE THAT THEY CAN POTENTIALLY TAKE THEIR CHILD TO AN OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDER TO GET THOSE SERVICES RATHER THAN TRYING TO EITHER ARRANGE FOR TRANSPORTATION TO TAKE THEIR CHILD HUNDRED FIFTY TWO HUNDRED MILES. SO AGAIN IT'S IT'S THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES NEEDS TO HOLD PLANS ACCOUNTABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE FULLY INFORMING BENEFICIARIES OF THEIR RIGHTS IN THE ELIGIBILITY FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF SERVICES AND WHO CAN OR SHOULD BE PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES. GOT IT. NO I UNDERSTAND THAT I THINK THAT LEADS TO MY NEXT QUESTION WHICH YOU KNOW IN YOUR HANDOUTS PAGE -- FOR AND THEN THE ON IT FIGURE TWO ON PAGE. FIFTEEN THE SAME BECAUSE THE CHS HAS PERFORMANCE STANDARDS THE BOXES YOU VIOLATED IS A JUST THREE TO SIX BUT IT'S REALLY HIGH. BUT I LOOK AT YOU KNOW FROM ZERO TO ONE TO TWO YOU DROP. YOU KNOW FROM 70%. 2402% THE FIRST YEAR AND ROUGHLY 25% FOR TWO YEAR OLDS. DID YOU FIND A REASON WHY THE HUGE DROP OFF IS IT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. IT IT'S PARTLY DUE TO THE LACK OF PERFORMANCE STANDARDS IN THAT SOMETHING THAT DH CS CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT -- IF. WHEN YOU TALK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DROP OFF FROM AGE -- ZERO TWO ONE TWO TWO THE THERE ARE REASONS FOR THAT THAT MAY BE. BEYOND DHS CSS CONTROL -- SUCH AS THE NEWBORNS CAN GO TO THE DOCTOR A LOT MORE OFTEN THAN TWO YEAR OLDS -- AND YET TWO YEAR OLDS ARE STILL REQUIRED TO RECEIVE -- OF MORE THAN ONE WELL CHILD CHECK UP. PRESS WATCHED. LEX PANEL THAT QUESTION. YES -- THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF THERE'S ADDITIONAL MEMBERS THAT HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT TO HARIAN SAYING DONE THANK YOU GUYS FOR LAYING THE GROUNDWORK. AND WE'LL GO TO CALL UP THE NEXT PANEL. GEN ITEM NUMBER. THREE THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES RESPONSE TO FINDINGS RECOMMENDATIONS OF CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S. JENNIFER CAN'T. WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES PLEASE I BELIEVE YOU HAVE PRESENTATION OR YOU ARE JUST. I WAS JUST GONNA SPEAK BOTH TO THE REPORT AS WELL AS HAPPY ANSWERED WHEN YOU'RE READY FINISH SURE THANK YOU. SO JENNIFER CAN -- DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- I WANTED -- TO PROVIDE JUST A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT I'M FOR THOSE OF YOU THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM -- MORE BROADLY BEFORE WE TALK ABOUT THE AUDIT SPECIFICALLY -- WE OVERSEE SIX LARGE DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THAT COLLECTIVELY PROVIDE CARE TO MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS AND SO THE SIX SYSTEMS -- CONSIST OF THE MANAGED CARE SYSTEM WHICH WILL SPEND OBVIOUSLY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT TODAY -- THERE'S THE FEE FOR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM THERE IS THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THERE'S THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SYSTEM THAT THE MIX OF BOTH STATE PLAN SERVICES AND WE WERE SERVICES WHICH I CAN TALK ABOUT -- THERE'S THE DENTAL -- SYSTEM BOTH FEE FOR SERVICE AND DENTAL MANAGE CARE AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA CHILDREN SYSTEM -- CALIFORNIA -- CHILDREN SERVICES SYSTEM IT IS THE OLDEST PROGRAM IN OUR DEPARTMENT IT WAS STARTED IN -- NINETEEN TWENTY SEVEN AND IS REALLY KIND OF A NATIONAL MODEL FOR AND SPECIALTY CARE FOR CHILDREN WITH VERY SPECIFIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS OF SERVICE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN. A YEAR -- WE ARE THE SECOND LARGEST PUBLIC HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY BEHIND MEDICARE -- BOTH IN TERMS OF SIZE OF POPULATION AS WELL AS IN BUDGET -- THE NEXT LARGEST MEDICAID PROGRAM IN THE NATION IS NEW YORK AND WEIRD MORE THAN TWICE AS BIG AS NEW YORK SO JUST FOR PURPOSES OF COMPARISON. WE AS THE AUDITOR NOTED HAVE ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF MILLION CHILDREN IN THE PROGRAM TODAY -- OUR CASELOAD CURRENTLY STANDS AT ABOUT THIRTEEN MILLION -- INDIVIDUALS ALL TOLD WE COVER HALF THE BIRTH IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE COVER TWO THIRDS OF THE NURSING HOME STAYS -- AND SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT COMPLEXITY OF WHAT WE DO AND HOW INDIVIDUALS GET SERVICES WE ARE -- COMMITTED TO OBVIOUSLY CONTINUE TO DELIVER WHAT IS AN ENTITLED SERVICE TO ENTITLED BENEFICIARIES -- WE WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES AS WELL AS I NOTED WITH CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES. WE HAVE CHILDREN THAT HAVE BECOME -- CCS ELIGIBLE UPON THEIR BIRTH AND WILL REMAIN WITH US FOR THE REMAINDER OF THEIR LIVES AND WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO IMPROVE AND ALWAYS STRIVE TO DO BETTER WHEN WE DELIVER CARE TO OUR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS -- SOME OF THE THINGS I THINK THAT WE ARE -- BOTH PROUD OF THAT CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO KIDS TODAY -- INCLUDE AND IMPROVE DENTAL PROGRAM I KNOW THAT I STOOD BEFORE DOCTOR WOULD AND OTHERS I WHEN I FIRST STARTED AT THE DEPARTMENT BACK IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN WE HAVE HAD AN AUDIT DONE BY THE STATE AUDITOR AROUND THE UTILIZATION OF SERVICES BY CHILDREN AND OUR DENTAL PROGRAM. AND WE SAID WE WILL DO BETTER AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING THAT AND I THINK THAT FOUR YEARS LATER -- WE CAN SAY THAT WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS I WOULD SAY THAT WE'RE NOT DONE BUT CERTAINLY WE HAVE INCREASED OUR UTILIZATION AND THAT HAS BEEN AS A RESULT OF THE PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE HAD WITH BOTH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- THE LEGISLATURE AT THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE PROVIDERS -- SO THAT IS SOMETHING I THINK THAT IS CONTINUING TO BOTH OF ALL OF AND IMPROVE BUT CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT -- WE HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS BEING MADE IN TERMS OF DELIVERY OF SERVICES TO CHILDREN -- A LITTLE KNOWN -- PROGRAM THAT WE STARTED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IS KNOWN AS WHOLE CHILD MODEL -- THESE ARE CHILDREN THAT -- RESIDE IN COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEM COUNTY SERVICE AREAS -- THEY ARE CHILDREN THAT STRADDLE THE CCS PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE MEDICAL PROGRAM AND THEY WERE HAVING THEIR SERVICES -- DISJOINTED BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND SO WE HAVE AN ROLE THESE CHILDREN IN VERY SPECIFIC COUNTIES -- INTO WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE WHOLE CHILD MODEL SUCH THAT ALL OF THEIR SERVICES ARE BEING DELIVERED BY THE FACT COUNTY ORGANIZED HEALTH SYSTEM. AND CAL OPTIMA THE ORANGE COUNTY MODEL WILL BE THE LAST COUNTY -- THAT WE BRING LIVE STARTING ON JULY -- ONE SOME OF THE ITEMS -- WE'RE STATE THAT OPERATES LARGE MEDICAID WAIVERS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND SO WHEN I TALK ABOUT PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- THEY CONSTITUTE ABOUT SIXTY BILLION DOLLARS OF OUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL BUDGET -- WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT WAIVERS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DEMONSTRATE CERTAIN THINGS IN THE STATE AND ONE OF THOSE IS -- WHOLE PERSON CARE WHICH I HINK NOT NECESSARILY FOCUS ON CHILDREN BUT CERTAINLY SOME OF THE INNOVATIVE. TYPES OF DELIVERY CHANGES THAT WE AS A STATE HAVE BEEN WORKING COLLECTIVELY WITH PROVIDERS AND COUNTIES AND ADVOCACY GROUPS TO TRY AND BRING ABOUT SIGNIFICANT LIFE ALTERING. OUTCOMES FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH EITHER MENTAL ILLNESS OR HOMELESSNESS OR CHRONIC DISEASE -- THE DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE -- IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT -- INVESTMENT THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HELPED US MAKE AND IN TERMS OF PROVIDING DENTAL CARE TO CHILDREN. DTI IS FOCUSED EXCLUSIVELY ON CHILDREN AND MEDICAL CHILDREN IN THE DENTAL PROGRAM -- WE HAVE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE DENTAL ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS PROVIDERS SCHOOLS MOBILE CLINICS TO INCREASE AND ENHANCE THE SERVICES THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED TO CHILDREN IN TERMS OF PREVENTIVE CARE I THINK WE HAVE -- HEARD QUITE WELL FRIEND THE STATE ORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR DOCTOR KUMAR THAT IF YOU DO NOT -- PROVIDE THE PREVENTIVE SERVICES TO THE CHILDREN AT THE BEGINNING -- THEIR ADULT DENTAL DISEASE -- IS IS M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; OR DRIVE DRAMATIC AND&lt;/c&gt;</u> MORE COSTLY AND SO WE HAVE CERTAINLY -- BEEN EXCITED TO EMBRACE AND SEE THE RESULTS OF THAT DENTAL TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE THROUGH OUR FEDERAL WAIVER -- LASTLY I KNOW THAT THE AUDITOR SPENT A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TOUCHING ON THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDS -- I WILL CERTAINLY PUT A PLUG IN TO SAY -- THOSE FUNDS HAVE BEEN -- BOTH INCREASINGLY HELPFUL AND REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL I BELIEVE IN THE THREE YEARS THAT WE HAVE BEEN I USING THEM -- OBVIOUSLY IN COOPERATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE THROUGH THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS LAST YEAR WE ADDED THE PREVENTIVE -- SERVICE CODES FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS SO PHYSICIANS WHEN THEY PROVIDE A PREVENTIVE SERVICE TO A CHILD THEY RECEIVE A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT FOR THAT -- SERVICE WHETHER THEY'RE IN FEE FOR SERVICE OR IN MANAGED CARE AND I THINK THAT THOSE FUNDS HAVE CERTAINLY AND WHAT WE HOPE WILL HOPE WILL CONTINUE TO SHOW. IS -- INCREASED -- BOTH UTILIZATION AND ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES WHICH IS THE OBVIOUSLY THE TOPIC OF TODAY'S HEARING -- THE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM -- AGAIN CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE AUDIT CALLED OUT -- THE APPLICATION PERIOD WAS SUPPOSED TO CLOSE ON FRIDAY -- WE OPENED APPLICATIONS FOR PHYSICIAN AND DENTAL LOAN REPAYMENT ON ON APRIL FIRST -- THE SYSTEM APPARENTLY -- COULD NOT HANDLE THE APPLICATIONS ON FRIDAY SO THERE WAS A BUNCH OF OF HUMAN NATURE -- AT ITS BEST IN TERMS OF PROCRASTINATION FOR TRYING TO GET THEIR APPLICATIONS AND AND SO WE HAD TO EXTEND THE DATE FOR APPLICATION THROUGH THIS WEEK -- AT LAST REPORT FOR ME -- THAT I WAS GIVEN WE HAD OVER FOURTEEN HUNDRED APPLICATIONS FROM BOTH PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS MOSTLY ON THE PHYSICIAN SIDE -- WE ARE OFFERING UP TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN LOAN REPAYMENT FOR PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS THAT PROVIDE US A FIVE YEAR COMMITMENT. TO SERVING IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM -- TO HAVING A THIRD OF THEIR PATIENT BASE BE MEDIC HAL -- AND WE'RE ADDING ADDITIONAL -- CONSIDERATION FOR DOCTORS THAT SERVE EVEN MORE THAN A THIRD OF THEIR PATIENT BASE OR IF THEY ARE PRACTICING A CERTAIN SPECIALTY AREA -- FOR WHICH WE ARE -- IMMINENTLY INTERESTED IN HELPING TO SUPPORT -- A INCREASE ACCESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SUCH AS AROUND CHILD PSYCHIATRY -- SO WE ARE REALLY EXCITED TO SEE HOW THESE -- LOAN REPAYMENT FUNDS WILL BE USED OVER THE COURSE OF THAT TIME IN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE HAS APPROPRIATED THE FUNDING -- AND THEN LASTLY -- THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN JANUARY -- VALUE BASED PURCHASING OF A PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS THAT DEMONSTRATE -- BASELINE IMPROVEMENT IN CERTAIN SPECIFIC AREAS THERE'S FOUR AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AND SPECIFICALLY AROUND ON CHILDREN IT'S AROUND OF BLOOD LED SCREEN. VACCINATIONS WELL CHILD VISITS AND DENTAL VARNISH AS APPLIED IN A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN'S OFFICE -- SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE AS A DEPARTMENT FACE AN AS WE FACE IS A PROGRAM -- WE ARE CONTINUING -- TO STRUGGLE TO INTEGRATE OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH -- PROGRAM SUCH THAT WE RECOGNIZE INDIVIDUALS IN OUR PROGRAM THEY COULD BE PARENTS THEY CAN BE CHILDREN THEY CAN BE SINGLE CHILDLESS ADULTS -- A LOT OF THEM HAVE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS EITHER SERIOUS OR MILD TO MODERATE AND THE IMPACT OF THAT DISEASE ON THEIR OVERALL HEALTH AS WELL AS ON THEIR FAMILY'S HEALTH AND SOCIETY'S OVERALL -- IMPACT HUSBAND DEEPLY FELT AND SO I THINK THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO THINK THROUGH. ESPECIALLY IS OUR FEDERAL WAIVERS -- COME DUE IN TWENTY TWENTY AND AND BOTH OUR SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WAIVER AS WELL AS OUR LARGE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER ARE -- EXPIRING WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF EACH OTHER AND I THINK YOU'LL HEAR US TALK -- PUBLICLY BOTH WITH THE LEGISLATURE AS WELL AS WITH STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT OUR INTEREST IN CONTINUING TO EVOLVE -- AND COORDINATE SERVICES BETWEEN THESE TWO DELIVERY SYSTEM SUCH THAT WE IMPROVE THE LIVES OF INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS -- DATA AND TRANSPARENCY -- WE CONTINUE. TO LOOK FOR WAYS IN WHICH WE USE THAT DATA TO DRIVE BETTER DECISIONS AT THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS TO DRIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PROGRAM. THE DATA THAT WE HAVE WE ARE ALWAYS AND EVERY TO MAKE AVAILABLE IN A MORE TRANSPARENT WAY SUCH THAT YOU WERE SEEN. THE REPORTS AND THE DATA AND THE OUTCOMES AND THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IS A PROGRAM SO I THINK THIS AUDIT CERTAINLY HIGHLIGHTS -- AN AREA IN WHICH DATA HAS SHOWN US THAT THERE IS A LOT OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AND THE FACT THAT THE DATA SYSTEMS. IN AND OF THEMSELVES PROBABLY DIDN'T EXIST FIVE TO SIX YEARS AGO IS REALLY KIND OF A STATEMENT AND THE KIND OF EVOLUTION THAT WE HAVE MADE AS A DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF CONTINUING TO TRY TO IMPROVE THAT AREA -- WE ARE SOMETIMES -- SLOW TO EITHER ADOPT OR ADAPT -- TECHNOLOGY -- WHEN IT COMES TO OUR PROGRAM I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS FOR THIS BUT WE ARE CERTAINLY -- LOOKING FORWARD -- TO SEEING HOW TECHNOLOGY CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF OUR BENEFICIARIES WE RECENTLY RELEASED. GUIDANCE TO PROVIDERS ACROSS ALL OF OUR DELIVERY SYSTEMS AROUND TELEMEDICINE AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP EASE -- ACCESS IN CERTAIN AREAS WHERE PROVIDERS MAY OR MAY NOT BE READILY ACCESSIBLE BUT CAN BE AVAILABLE THROUGH A TELEMEDICINE TYPE OF CONSULTATION. AND THEN LASTLY -- I WOULD BE REMISS TO SAY THAT -- SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE FACED HAVE BEEN INCREASING -- CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN TERMS OF THE OVERSIGHT -- AND REQUIREMENTS THAT WE AS A STATE MEDICAID PROGRAM HAVE -- BEEN -- SUBJECT TO AS A AS A RESULT OF CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE FEDERAL MANAGE CARE RULE THAT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WAS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE MANAGED CARE PROGRAM -- IN TWENTY YEARS AND SO THAT -- VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT REGULATION HAD IMPLICATIONS ACROSS A SIGNIFICANT SWATH OF OUR PROGRAM AND THOSE ARE STILL CHANGES THAT WE ARE -- IMPLEMENTING TODAY AND OBVIOUSLY THE NETWORK STANDARDS IN THE NETWORK ADEQUACY DISCUSSION THAT WAS PART OF THIS AUDIT WAS A RESULT OF THAT AND FEDERAL MANAGED CARE RULE -- AS IT PERTAINS TO THE AUDIT ITSELF -- AS YOU SEE IN OUR RESPONSES TO THE AUDITOR'S OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IS THAT WE BY AND LARGE -- BOTH EXCEPT -- AND AGREE WITH THEIR OF THE FINDINGS -- WE CAN AND ARE COMMITTED TO DOING BETTER -- BY ALL OF OUR POPULATION IN THE PROGRAM AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE ARE COMMITTED TO IMPROVING -- THE UTILIZATION OF PREVENTIVE SCREENINGS FOR CHILDREN -- THE GOVERNOR OBVIOUSLY COMING INTO OFFICE -- THIS YEAR HAD A VERY CLEAR AND CONSISTENT MESSAGE ABOUT HIS INTEREST IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND WHAT HE COULD DO TO INCREASE AND IMPROVE ACCESS FOR CHILDREN AT THE EARLIEST LEVELS AND SO. THERE WERE -- COMMUNICATIONS MADE TO THE PLANS -- WHEN HE FIRST CAME INTO OFFICE AROUND WANTING TO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW WE HAVE TEN AND A HALF MILLION INDIVIDUALS AND OUR PROGRAM THAT ARE IN MANAGED CARE TODAY HE ASKED THE PLANS? TO ODD. LET HIM KNOW IN TERMS OF HOW ARE THEY DOING IN TERMS OF THE PROVISION OF SCREENINGS AND SERVICES TO CHILDREN NOT ONLY MEDI CAL BUT MORE BROADLY. I'M OBVIOUSLY LOW INCOME POPULATIONS HAVE A SPECIAL -- IMPACT IN OUR PARTICULAR DEPARTMENT BUT CERTAINLY CHILDREN IN ANY PART OF THE STATE ON HE WAS INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM THE PLANS AROUND HOW WERE THEY DELIVERY SERVICES AND WHAT COULD BE DONE TO IMPROVE THAT -- CONSISTENT WITH THE AUDIT AND THE GOVERNOR'S INTEREST IN STRENGTHENING THE ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE SCREENINGS WE HAVE -- SOME RESOURCE REQUEST THAT WE HAVE PENDING WITH THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS. IN WHICH WE ARE PROPOSING TO DO TARGETED OUTREACH TO FAMILIES SO YOU CONSISTENT WITH THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU'VE ALREADY ANSWERED -- ASKED AROUND YOU TO PARENTS EVEN KNOW THAT THE SCREENS -- EXIST HOW DO THEY GET THESE SERVICES -- CAN WE HAD DONE -- TARGETED OUTREACH TO FAMILIES AROUND THE DENTAL SERVICES -- WHERE WE REACHED OUT TO FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN ZERO TO THREE AND SAID DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN TAKE YOUR CHILD TO A DENTIST NOW AND HAVE THAT COVERED AND? THAT ACTUALLY INCREASED -- A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS SEEKING A DENTAL VISIT FOR THEIR CHILDREN FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'RE PROPOSING TO DO THAT AGAIN -- USING THE BRIGHT FUTURES -- SCHEDULE TO ADVISE PARENTS THAT YOUR CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF PREVENTIVE SCREENINGS AND SO LOOKING FOR RESOURCES IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET TO COME DO THAT IN A TARGETED WAY -- WE WILL BE REQUIRED IN OUR PLANS TO DO FOLLOW UP ON THAT TARGETED OUTREACH SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THE STATE IS -- REACHING OUT TO FAMILIES AND SAYING YOU HAVE SERVICES AVAILABLE YOU SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT YOUR CHILD IS GETTING EACH OF THESE THINGS ACCORDING TO THEIR AGE AND ACCORDING TO THE TIME IN WHICH THE SCREENING SHOULD BE DONE -- THE PLANTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE FOLLOWING UP WITH THOSE FAMILIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CONSISTENTLY TRYING -- TO LET PARENTS KNOW THAT THEY CAN MAKE THOSE APPOINTMENTS AND THAT THERE'S TRANSPORTATION AVAILABLE IN THOSE CASES IF THEY DON'T HAVE -- APPROPRIATE TRANSPORTATION I'VE SPOKEN ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL MONEY -- FOR SERVICES ESPECIALLY AROUND DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENS -- WHICH IS IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS YEAR TO ADD A SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT -- FOR PROVIDERS DOING THAT AS WELL AS IN THE PREVENTIVE SERVICES -- AND THEN VALUE BASED PURCHASING -- I WILL SPEAK BRIEFLY -- TO THE ALTERNATIVE ACCESS REQUESTS -- WE AND THE AUDITOR'S CERTAINLY STATED THIS OP CORRECTLY WE WERE SURPRISED BY THE NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE ACCESS REQUESTS THAT WERE MADE BY THE PLANS WHEN WE INITIATED THAT PROCESS LAST YEAR. I THINK WE WERE SURPRISED -- IN PARTICULAR -- THAT THERE WAS A REALLY HIGH NUMBER COMING FROM UP ONE SINGLE COUNTY -- THAT HAS BOTH A VERY VERY DENSE URBAN AREA AS WELL AS A LOT OF SIGNIFICANT RURAL AREAS WITHIN THAT COUNTY -- AND SO IT WAS ALSO ONE OF OUR LEARNING EXPERIENCES TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS DRIVING THE NATURE OF THOSE ALTERNATIVE ACCESS REQUEST -- THEY ARE BY ZIP CODE SO IF YOU ARE IN A RURAL COUNTY WITH ZIP CODES IN WHICH THERE ARE NO PEOPLE BUT YOU STILL HAVE THE ZIP CODE. EACH PLAN HAD TO FILE AN ALTERNATIVE ACCESS FOR EACH TYPE OF PROVIDER FOR WHICH THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE SEEKING. A STANDARD AND THEN THAT IS HOW IN SOME CASES THE NUMBERS GOT SO HIGH SO FAST SO -- IN INYO COUNTY IF YOU'RE LOOKING -- TO HAVE A PROVIDER STANDARD FOR YOU KNOW PRIMARY CARE HOSPITALS OBG WHY AND THE PEDIATRIC SPECIALTY THE PHARMACY ALL OF THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES BY WHICH THE PLANS HAD TO SUBMIT NETWORKS. IF THERE IS NOTHING IN THAT ZIP CODE MEANING THERE ARE NO PEOPLE AND THERE ARE NO SERVICES THEY HAVE TO FILE AN ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARD FOR EACH PROVIDER TYPE IN EACH ZIP CODE AND IF THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF ZIP CODES. YOU CAN JUST SEE HOW THAT KIND OF HOW THAT PLAYED OUT -- AROUND -- RATES I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT -- ARE -- HEALTHCARE FINANCE SCENE -- DIVISION HAS WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE PLANS ON WE HAVE AN OUTSIDE ACTUARIAL FIRM. THAT CONSISTENTLY -- WORKS WITH BOTH OUR DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS A A RATE WORK GROUP CONSISTING OF A PLANNED CFO'S AND C. E. O.'S WE SET SIXTEEN HUNDRED RATE CELLS A YEAR -- AND THOSE ARE ALL PUT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH THIS FEDERAL ACTED AND SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT -- CHANGING OR ADDING OR INCREASING RATES ARE DOING SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS ALL OF THAT WORK COMES -- INITIATED THROUGH OUR FINANCING DIVISION -- WE IN GENERAL WORK WITH THE PLANS -- IN TERMS OF LIKE POLICY ISSUES MAKING SURE THAT THE ACTUARIES FLOW THE DRAFT RATES BACK TO THE PLANS. THE PLANS CAN CERTAINLY -- LOOK AT TRENDS AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING DATA BECAUSE WE USE THE PLAN STATED TO HELP SET THE RATES BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY -- WE'RE USING THE PLANS ENCOUNTERS THEIR OWN DATA SUBMISSIONS AND THEN THE ACTUARIES ARE TRENDING IT FORWARD -- AND THOSE ARE THE RATES THAT WE SUBMIT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR APPROVAL AND THEN OBVIOUSLY FOR FOR PAYOUT BUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED RATE CELLS ACROSS THE STATE. ACROSS THE PLAN TYPES ACROSS ELIGIBILITY CATEGORIES -- AROUND EPS TT SO THIS IS AN ENTITLED BENEFIT FOR ANY CHILD IN MEDICAID UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE IT IS A VERY VERY BROAD. BENEFIT AND IT ESSENTIALLY SAYS -- FOR CHILD THAT ALL OF THE SCREENS THAT THEY NEED AS WELL AS ANY OF THE DIAGNOSTIC -- SERVICES AS WELL AS ANY TREATMENT OR ANYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO AMELIORATETHE CONDITION OF THE CHILD HAS HAS TO BE PROVIDED IT IS IT IS BOTH SIGNIFICANT. AND COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE IT APPLIES TO SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IT APPLIES TO MENTAL% HEALTH IT APPLIES TO DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES IT APPLIES TO PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND SO -- WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH ADVOCATES THERE WAS A BILL THAT WAS SIGNED BY -- THE GOVERNOR LAST YEAR SB TWELVE EIGHTY SEVEN AROUND -- CONSISTENT YOU PST T. BOTH LANGUAGE AND TREATMENT ACROSS ALL THE DIFFERENT AREAS AND OF OUR DEPARTMENT THAT HANDLE YOU PST T. BENEFITS -- WE HAVE CHANGED OUR EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE THE THESE ARE THE DOCUMENTS THAT FAMILIES GET FROM THE PLAN SAYING THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE ENTITLED TO AND SO WE HAVE. BOTH -- CLARIFIED AND EXTENDED THE AMOUNT OF DETAIL IN THE EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE DOCUMENT SURROUND THAT EPS TT BENEFIT -- WE HAVE AND I HAVE A COUPLE OF COPIES OF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE WE HAVE CHANGED WHAT USED TO BE KNOWN AS THE IT WAS REALLY GOOD PUB -- SIXTY EIGHT A REALLY GOOD GOVERNMENT NAME TO ON MY MEDI CAL WE HAVE MADE IT A MORE FRIENDLY BROCHURE WE HAVE USED A LOT MORE GRAPHICS WE HAVE TRIED -- TO HIGHLIGHT CERTAIN SERVICES BUT IT IS AN ENCAPSULATION FOR ALL BENEFICIARIES THAT THEY GET ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO SAY THIS IS WHAT MEDI CAL IS FOR YOU THIS IS WHAT MEDICAL IS FOR YOUR CHILDREN. THIS IS WHAT'S AVAILABLE IT TALKS ABOUT DENTAL IT TALKS ABOUT YOU PST T. -- IT IS -- TRANSLATED INTO ALL OF THE DIFFERENT THRESHOLD LANGUAGES -- WE'RE REALLY PROUD OF THE FACT THAT -- WE HAVE PUT IN A MUCH MORE FRIENDLY AND ACCESSIBLE -- DOCUMENT AND CERTAINLY THAT IS ONE OF THE WAYS IN WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT -- THE AVAILABILITY OF EPS D. T. FOR FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. AND THEN LASTLY OUTWHAT THE AUDITOR I HAD MENTIONED IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE WORKING -- WITH OUR PLANS ON IN TERMS OF FURTHER CLARIFICATION AND GUIDANCE AROUND ALL PLAN LETTERS AS TO WHAT PLANS SHOULD BE PROVIDING AND THE FREQUENCY OF WHICH THOSE SERVICES -- NEED TO BE MADE AVAILABLE. AND THEN -- I THINK THOUGH THE LAST THING I WILL -- SPEAK. TO IS ON PROVIDER AVAILABILITY SO ON THE AUDIT NOTED THAT OUR ANNUAL ON IT SO WE SEND OUT OUR AUDIT TEAM EVERY YEAR -- TO AUDIT ARE MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS THERE'S TWENTY FOUR PLANS -- THEY WERE ESSENTIALLY TESTING A VERY SMALL SAMPLE SIZE OF PROVIDERS BY CALLING AND SAYING YOU KNOW I NEED AN A AN APPOINTMENT YOU KNOW WHEN IS THE NEXT ONE AVAILABLE -- IN THE AUDIT HAD NOTED THAT THAT WAS A PRETTY SMALL SAMPLE SIZE STARTING LAST JANUARY SO JANUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE ASK OUR EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW ORGANIZATION TO DO A MUCH BROADER SAMPLING OF PROVIDER AVAILABILITY. SO WE'RE SAMPLING -- UPWARDS OF TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND PROVIDERS -- THROUGH THIS EACH YEAR -- CONTRACT IN WHICH WE ARE CALLING TO SAY YOU KNOW WHEN IS THE NEXT AVAILABLE APPOINTMENT ARE YOU ACCEPTING NEW PATIENTS AND REALLY TRYING TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHEN THOSE NETWORKS ARE FILED WITH US -- WE HAVE AN INDEPENDENT VALIDATION BY AN INDEPENDENT ENTITY THAT IS OUT THERE TESTING THAT TO MAKE SURE AND THEN WE ARE GETTING THOSE -- WE'RE GETTING THAT FEEDBACK ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND I THINK THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO BOTH REFINED AND HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING OUT IN THE VARIOUS PARTS OF THE STATE THAT MAY HAVE -- CHALLENGES WITH ACCESS. SO -- WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO AND STOP IN IN ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR THAT TESTIMONY AND I KNOW THAT. THERE'S A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I APPRECIATE YOUR JUST WHEN YOU TOUCHED UPON -- SOME OF SOME OF THE THINGS I WAS WONDERING ABOUT TELEMEDICINE AS WELL AS MAYBE AN ALTERNATIVE ACCESS POINT -- BUT YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE BREAK FUTURE SCHEDULE AND WHAT THAT ACTUALLY MEANS AND USING THAT ACTUALLY INFORMED -- FAMILIES OF SOME OF THE SERVICES AND SO I WAS WONDERING ARE THERE ADDITIONAL WAYS TO TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO FAMILIES BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RATES AND WHAT THE HONOR TO POINT IT OUT. YOU KNOW YOU SEE THIS THIS LACK OF UTILIZATION AND I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. YEAH THAT'S GREAT YEAH THE BROCHURE THE PUB. SIXTY FIVE AND THAT BUT HOW ARE WE ARE REMOVING PASSED. YOU KNOW THESE ARE THINGS WE'RE DOING BUT HOW ARE WE SHOWING THE RESULTS KIND OF MOVING FORWARD RIGHT. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK THAT -- WHAT WE HAVE FOUND -- AT LEAST CERTAINLY SPEAKING FOR MYSELF PERSONALLY WITH MY HISTORY WITH THE DEPARTMENT IS YOU CANNOT RELY ON A SINGLE -- INTERVENTION TO AFFECT A CHANGE IN OUR PROGRAM IT IS SIMPLY -- TOO BIG -- THERE ARE TOO MANY DIFFERENT -- PLACES IN WHICH POPULATIONS ARE DIFFERENT AND NEEDED TARGETED INTERVENTION I THINK THAT WE HAVE A S. A SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS -- THROUGH AND WE HAVE A MANAGED CARE ADVISORY GROUP AS WELL AS A BROADER STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON AS WELL AS OBVIOUSLY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE HAVE -- IN A POLICY BASIS. WE LIKE TO GO AND SAY WE'RE STRUGGLING -- WHAT'S HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR EXAMPLE YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DATA AND WHILE I'M HISPANIC CHILDREN -- HAVE A HIGHER VACCINATION RATE WE'D REALLY LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHY ANOTHER ON POPULATION IS NOT SEEN THAT SAME KIND OF ACCEPTANCE AND ADOPTION OF THE VACCINE. AND SO -- SOME OF THE WORK AROUNDS -- TARGETING INTERVENTIONS REALLY COMES FROM FEEDBACK FROM PEOPLE THAT ARE CLOSER TO THE GROUND IF YOU WILL IN TERMS OF PROVIDERS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LEGAL ADVOCATES -- TRADE ASSOCIATIONS AND CERTAINLY THE HEALTH PLANS BECAUSE THEY ARE DELIVERY SERVICES IN THAT REGIONAL AREA AND SO -- SOME OF THE WORK AROUNDS INCREASING UTILIZATION WILL COME AS A RESULT OF YOU KNOW DOING THE TARGETED OUT REACH. MAKING THE PLANS -- MORE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE FOLLOW UP AND FEEDBACK ON TO THERE MEMBERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR MEMBERS ARE ACCESSING SERVICES THERE'S CERTAINLY A CONVERSATION AND AND LEARNING COLLABORATIVE'S THAT NEED TO TAKE PLACE WITH THE PROVIDERS THEMSELVES. I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW THE DOCTOR WOULD. BE IN A PROVIDER CAN CERTAINLY -- APPRECIATE AS WELL AS FROM WHAT WE HEAR ANECDOTALLY IS WHEN YOU HAVE. A FULL PRACTICE -- AND YOU HAVE A VERY LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME WITH A PATIENT YOU MAY JUST BE TREATING THE PATIENT FOR WHAT THAT COMPLAIN AS TODAY AND YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE THE TIME. TO KIND OF LOOK AT THE FULL -- ARRAY OF SERVICES THAT THEY SHOULD BE GETTING BUT THEY MAY NOT BE -- USING AND SO I THINK SOME OF THE VALUE BASED PURCHASED SCENE -- INITIATIVES THAT WERE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW IS REALLY GETTING AT THE PROVIDER LEVEL IN THE PROVIDER'S OFFICE TO INCENTIVIZE THEM TO LOOK AT THAT -- CHILD IN A MORE COMPREHENSIVE WAY TO SAY YOU MIGHT BE HERE FOR AN EAR INFECTION -- BECAUSE THAT YOUR CHIEF COMPLAINT TODAY BUT I'M ALSO NOTICING THAT YOU'RE ABOUT READY TO START SCHOOL -- HAVE YOU RECEIVED YOUR VACCINES OR YOU KNOW HAVE YOU EVER YOU KNOW RECEIVED A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SCREEN OR YOU KNOW LET'S TALK ABOUT YOUR DENTAL YOUR LASTED TO LOOK SAM AND SO. THERE'S A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS THAT WE HAVE COMMITTED TO TO INCREASE UTILIZATION BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE'S ONE THING THAT WILL BE THE SILVER BULLET TO HELP. TO HELP DRIVE THOSE UTILIZATION RATES IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A BROAD SPECTRUM OF THINGS. AND IN ADDITION YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA TO HAVE PRIMARY FOR THE OR THE PHYSICIAN OR WHOEVER THEY'RE GOING TO GO SEE. YOU KNOW ASK FOR THOSE ADDITIONAL SERVICES I THINK THAT'S A GREAT WAY TO DO IT -- POLITICOS POINTED OUT AND THOUGHT IT ALSO WAS A THE PERFORMANCE METRICS. RIGHT WHEN I THINK THAT WAS. SO THE THINGS THAT WE MEASURE -- ARE ARE OKAY AND THE THINGS THAT WE ARE NOT MEASURE EIGHTEEN ARE NOT SO GREAT AND SO I THINK THAT THAT -- WAS SOMETHING THAT WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WERE GOING TO BE ADDING ALL OF THE CHILD AND ADULT COURSE THAT MEASURES -- THAT IS AN ACCELERATION OF WHAT A FEDERAL REQUIREMENT IS AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE WILL HAVE THOSE AND WE WILL BE MEASURING FOR ALL OF THOSE MEASURES. YOU WILL CERTAINLY -- AND THIS IS OUR HOPE -- YOU WILL SEE THAT UTILIZATION INCREASE A BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE HOLDING THE PLANS ACCOUNTABLE AND MEASURING IT. BUT IT ALSO -- COULD BE AND I KNOW THAT -- YOU WOULD ASK THIS OF THE PREVIOUS PANEL IT MAY ALSO BE A DATA CHALLENGE AND THAT IF YOU HAVE A ONE YEAR OLD AND THEY'RE IN THE DOCTOR MORE OFTEN. IT IT COULD ALSO BE A DATA ISSUE FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT THE PHYSICIAN IS JUST BUILDING A EXAM CODE. AND NOT A WELL CHILD CODE AND SO I THINK THAT IS ALSO SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING AS A DEPARTMENT WHICH IS HOW DO WE IMPROVE. ENCOUNTER DATA SO ENCOUNTER DATA FLOWS FROM THE PHYSICIAN TO THE PLAN TO THE STATE AND SO THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE BEEN DASH FOURTEEN AND PLAN TO MAKE AVAILABLE -- PUBLICLY IS THE ENCOUNTER DATA THAT THE PLANTS GET FROM THE PROVIDERS AND I THINK THAT WILL ALSO HAVE. SOME IMPACT NOT A SIGNIFICANT BUT A BOWL HAVE SOME DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT ACTUALLY CHANGE SOME OF THE DATA IN THOSE AREAS THAT WERE NOT CURRENTLY HOLDING THE PLANTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR YEAH I'D BE INTERESTED IN SEEING WHAT THAT DATE IS I KNOW YOU HEARD ME REFERENCE -- PREVIOUS PANEL THAT I THINK IT WAS -- FIGURE TO PAGE FIFTEEN OF THE IDEA TO WRITE. WE SEE THE BIG DROP OFF BETWEEN ONE AND TWO YEAR OLD YES AND SO GET UPS THAT WOULD REFORM THAT WOULD BE. MY ASSUMPTION YEAH AND I THINK WE'RE COMMITTED -- TO SHARING THAT DATA THAT WE HAVE TOLD THE PLANS THAT -- ALL OF THOSE -- MEASUREMENTS ARE BEING ADDED IN THIS CURRENT YEAR SO IN THIS CURRENT MEASUREMENT YEAR AND THEY'LL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THAT AND SO IT WILL BE A COMBINATION OF BOTH BETTER DATA SUBMISSIONS FROM THE PROVIDERS TO THE PLANS. BUT ALSO FOR THE PLANS TO BE WORKING WITH THEIR PROVIDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY KNOW THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE. FOR THOSE MEASURES AND SO WE'RE HAPPY TO KIND OF PROVIDE -- CONSISTED FEEDBACK WITH WHAT WERE SEEN IN TERMS OF THE DATA. I APPRECIATE YOU -- MAKING COMMENTS ABOUT HOLDING THE PLANS A LITTLE MORE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THIS PERFORMANCE METRICS. COULD ONLY LOOK AT JUST. THEY HANDED OUT AND YOU SEE ALL THESE AXES. FOR FOR MEASUREMENTS THAT ARE BEING MET FOR ALL THESE AGE GROUPS. YOU KNOW IT'S A LITTLE CONCERNING I THINK FOR THE LEGISLATURE. IN OBVIOUSLY THREE TO SIX YEAR OLDS SEEM LIKE THINGS ARE GREAT BECAUSE THERE'S A PART FOR THE PERFORMANCE METRICS ARE THERE. BUT WE DON'T SEE THEM IN THE OTHER AGE GROUPS AND YOU SEE THE LACK OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED THERE. YOU KNOW WE'D LIKE TO SEE THAT AND HOPEFULLY THE SIXTY DAY SIX MONTH AND CANNOT FOLLOW UPS AS WELL SO I KNOW WILL BE LOOKING. FOR FOR TO THAT ALSO -- ONE OF THE ITS EXIT MENTIONED ESPECIALLY FOR RURAL AREAS TO REPRESENT SOME RURAL AREAS AS WELL. IS A ACCESS TO TO CARE. AND THAT THE TRANSPORTATION. AND SO YOU KNOW IN A FORGET WHICH HEALTH PROFESSIONALS YOU OUTLINED WHERE THEY MIGHT NOT BE ACCESSIBLE THERE BUT ARE WE LOOKING AT DOING THINGS LIKE TELEMEDICINE. TO PROVIDE THOSE ARE MAYBE SOME OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDERS THAT MIGHT BE A LOT CLOSER SURE SO -- A COUPLE THINGS SO TELEMEDICINE -- BUT WE THINK IT'S CERTAINLY. BOTH HELPFUL AND AND A RURAL AND IN AN URBAN AREA -- ESPECIALLY AS IT PERTAINS TO SPECIALTY CARE IT HAS -- BEEN EXTENSIVELY USED -- WITH OUR FQHCS APPAN THE HI NORTHERN AREAS I KNOW THAT -- SHASTA HAS A VERY SUCCESSFUL TELEMEDICINE -- PROGRAM THAT THEY USE WITH UC DAVIS IN TERMS TO TELL US LIKE HIGH ENTRY SO PLANS ARE ABLE TO USE TELEMEDICINE AND TELE CONSULS -- IN SOME CASES TO HELP MEET SOME OF THEIR NETWORK REQUIREMENTS -- I THINK THAT. THE LOAN REPAYMENT OF A APPLICATIONS THE PHYSICIANS FOR A HEALTHY CALIFORNIA IS DOING% THE INITIAL KIND OF REVIEW OF THE APPLICANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE RIGHT THEY HAVE TO BE WITHIN FIVE YEARS OF RESIDENCY -- OR HAVE JUST GRADUATED FROM TO AMEND MEDICAL OR DENTAL SCHOOL WITHIN THE LAST FIVE YEARS THEY'RE DOING THAT KIND OF INITIAL CUT AND THEN WE DOWN. AND SAY YOU KNOW WHO ARE THESE DOCTORS -- WHERE DO THEY PRACTICE -- LET'S TRY TO BALANCE -- CENTRAL VALLEY NEEDS WITH HI NORTHERN AREA WITH SPECIALTY TYPE I MEAN IT'S A REALLY EXCITING PROCESS FOR US I THINK WE ARE. REALLY -- CONVINCED THAT BY TAKING THE DEBT -- CALCULATION OUT OF A PROVIDERS -- MIND WHEN THEY GRADUATE THAT THEY DON'T IF THEY DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH DEBT THEY HAVE TO REPAIR THEM CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE PROFESSIONAL. PLACE IN WHICH THEY PRACTICE AND WE'RE REALLY -- COMMITTED TO HELPING THEM WANT TO STAY IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM LONGER THAN FIVE YEARS -- SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT TO BE SAID FOR THE NORTHERN AREA AS WELL CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH WE HAVE HEARD CONSISTENTLY STRUGGLE -- I COME FROM I GREW UP AND WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL EL PATEL CALIFORNIA POPULATION. SIX HUNDRED THIRTY NINE THE ELEVATION IS HIGHER THAN THE POPULATION -- THERE ARE PLACES IN OUR STATE AND I KNOW THAT -- THE AUDITOR CERTAINLY USED -- THIS IS AN EXAMPLE IN WHICH CERTAIN SPECIALTY -- TYPES ESPECIALLY PEDIATRIC SPECIALTY TYPES ARE THREE FOUR HUNDRED MILES AWAY -- THERE ARE ONLY PROBABLY A HANDFUL OF PEDIATRIC NEURO OPHTHALMOLOGIST IN THE ENTIRE STATE. AND IF YOU LIVE IN INYO OR MONNOW OR YOU KNOW I'LL PURTELL CALIFORNIA -- YOU WILL HAVE TO GO TO UC SAN FRANCISCO TO HAVE ACCESS TO A PEDIATRIC NEURO OPHTHALMOLOGIST THAT'S JUST KIND OF THE WAY IT IS I THINK THAT -- TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE PROVIDERS CLOSER BY THAT CAN SUCCESSFULLY ADDRESS THE CHILD'S NEEDS AND I WOULD SAY -- CHILDREN AND I AM REMINDED OF THIS BY THE CHILDREN'S SPECIALTY CARE COALITION ALL THE TIME IS PEDIATRIC -- SPECIALISTS ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN ADULT SPECIALTY SO A ADULT CARDIOLOGISTS DOES NOT A PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGIST AND SO. ON WE ARE TRYING REALLY HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PLANS NO THEY HAVE TO CONTRACT WITH PEDIATRIC SPECIALISTS I THINK WE HAVE SEEN EVEN IN THE INITIAL DATA THAT THE PLANS HAVE BEEN DOING THAT AND SO WE EXPECT THOSE ALTERNATIVE ACCESS REQUEST TO BE COMING DOWN PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY. AND THE NEXT REPORTING YEAR JUST BASED ON THAT -- EXPECTATION SO I THINK YOU WILL SEE REFINEMENT -- AS WE CONTINUE TO ROLL THIS PROCESS OUT. J. TELEVISION THOSE COMMENTS AND SPECIALLY -- WOULD YOU KNOW. HOW MORE QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS IN THOSE AREAS AS WELL ON YOUR PUSH FOR DOING THAT -- IS APPRECIATED I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS HERE -- ONE OF THE PER HOPE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS TIME WAS A STEPHEN THOMPSON LOAN PAYMENT PROGRAM FOR INSTANCE. AND YOU KNOW I HAVE LEGISLATION. A NUMBER OF US OF SPORTS OF THOSE MEASURES INCREASING HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM YEAH -- YOU KNOW IN ALL PARTS OF THE STATE SO -- I APPRECIATE THAT AND LET ME. KNOW -- DOCTOR WHAT'S GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS OR MAYBE I'LL JUST COME BACK -- WE'LL GO BACK TO JUST FOR A SECOND -- BUT THE TELEMEDICINE PART OF THIS BECAUSE WE WE HEAR WE HEAR FROM PLANS THAT. THAT. THAT -- TELEMEDICINE STILL LACKING AND YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT. YOU SEE A VALUE THAT SAID THAT CASEY'S BUT I HERE ON THE OTHER END THAT PLANS ARE SAYING THAT. IT'S STILL IT'S STILL NOT WORKING AND AND PART OF IT IS. THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW THE ABILITY ACCESS OUTSIDE THE FOUR WALLS AND SO -- CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHERE. I WAS HE GOTTO WE GOT DISCONNECTS HERE SO -- AND I WOULD BE I'M I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE -- WITH THE TELEMEDICINE POLICY THAT WE RELEASED IN THE FALL IT WAS ACROSS MANAGE CARE FEE FOR SERVICE -- OUR MENTAL HEALTH -- DELIVERY SYSTEM AS WELL AS ON FAMILY PLANNING AND ANY PLACE IN WHICH WE HAVE PROVIDERS THAT ARE BILLING SERVICES ACROSS THE DIFFERENT DELIVERY SYSTEMS -- WE WERE TRYING TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT A CONSULTATION THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE -- IN A PROVIDER'S OFFICE THAT COULD BE DONE VIA TELEMEDICINE THERE'S SOMETHING THERE SOME SERVICES THAT ARE NOT APPROPRIATE BE TELL US AND OBVIOUSLY BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT IT COULD BE DONE. THAT THEY COULD BILL FOR IT AND HOW TO DO THAT AND SO WE PROVIDED PRETTY EXPLICIT -- INSTRUCTIONS THROUGH ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ON THE PROVIDER MANUAL -- OUR PROVIDER BULLETINS -- AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE THAT BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY TECHNICAL AS TO SEE HOW WE SAID IT COULD BE DONE BUT IT WAS OUR INTENTION TO MAKE SURE. THAT IF IT'S APPROPRIATE -- THEN THE CONSULTATION SHOULD TAKE PLACE VIA TELEMEDICINE AND YOU WOULD BILL IT AS YOU NORMALLY WOULD. WELL I WOULD JUST SAY I GUESS IT THAT'S DOESN'T APPEAR. FROM THE PLANE'S PERSPECTIVE THAT IS WORKING THAT WELL -- AND THE COULD WE IN OTHER WORDS YOU COULD BE DOING MORE WITH THAT I THINK THAT'S THE IMPLICATION THAT'S GREAT FEEDBACK -- SO. BEEN LISTENING TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE AUDITOR THEY SAID THAT. THE DA SAYS WASN'T PARTICULARLY SURPRISED BY. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY WERE POINTING OUT ARE ASKING -- I GUESS IT WOULD HAVE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE IN MANAGED CARE AND YOU KNOW TWO AND A HALF MILLION KIDS THAT ARE NOT GETTING CARE ON A REGULAR BASIS. HOW LONG THE JUNO? UP ABOUT THIS. AND AND WHAT IT WHAT IT WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN THE BACKGROUND I KNOW YOU KNOW THERE'S A NEW DASHBOARD THIS BEEN GOING ON BUT THIS IS THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT JUST APPEARED OVERNIGHT. HOW LONG DID YOU KNOW OR OR MAKE ME THAT'S NOT A FAIR QUESTION HAVE YOU BEEN ACTIVELY WORK HAS THE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY BEEN REALLY WORKING ON THIS? BECAUSE I WILL SAY THAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WHEN I SAW THE AUDIT I WAS PRETTY SHOCKED -- IT'S PRETTY HARD TO MISS PLACE TWO AND A HALF MILLION KIDS. SURE I THINK -- A COUPLE THINGS. THE ADDITION OF THE PREVENTIVE SERVICE CODES -- IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WHEN WE ADDED THOSE TO THE PROP. FIFTY SIX CERTAINLY REFLECTED -- BOTH OUR INTEREST IN UNDERSTANDING THAT -- PROVIDERS IF INCENTIVIZE TO BILL. AN EXAM CODE A STANDARD EXAM CODE WOULD BY PASS THE APPROPRIATE CODE THAT THEY PROBABLY SHOULD BE -- BILLING I THINK WHAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS HAS BEEN -- NOT NECESSARILY IGNORING CHILDREN BUT WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING THE BASE INFRASTRUCTURE -- TO EVEN HAVE THE DATA TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING AT A MORE AND MORE GRANULAR LEVEL -- OUR PLANS HAVE -- MEDICAL GROUPS THAT OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW A PLAN WILL CONTRACT WITH. A CERTAIN IPA OR CERTAIN MEDICAL GROUP AND SO THE DATA QUALITY THE MORE THAT IT GETS DELEGATED -- THE HARDER IT IS FOR THAT DAY TO COME BACK IN A BETTER WAY AND SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE PLANTS AROUND THE PROVIDER FILES THAT WE GET. AROUND THE ENCOUNTER DATA SUBMISSIONS -- SOME OF THOSE THINGS -- HAVE TAKEN AND A WHILE TO BOTH -- IMPLEMENT AND THEN ONCE YOU HAVE THE DATA COMING IN YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT SAYING ALRIGHT WHAT A MY SCENE HERE IN TERMS OF THE MANAGEMENT SUMMARY. I THINK THAT -- IT WAS CERTAINLY NOT OUR INTENTION TO TAKE OUR EYE OFF THIS PARTICULAR AREA OF THE PROGRAM BUT I THINK THAT -- AS I SAID THERE HAVE BEEN -- SIGNIFICANT OTHER INITIATIVES UNDER WAY IN OUR DEPARTMENT -- THE SAME PEOPLE THAT WORK MANAGE CARE ALSO ARE WORKING ON ACCORDING TO CARE INITIATIVE WHICH IS OUR DUAL -- INITIATIVE TO BLEND CARE BETWEEN MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT SIT IN BOTH PROGRAMS HE WAS JUST HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT COMPETING DEMANDS AND SO I THINK THIS AUDIT WAS A REALLY GOOD -- REMINDER FOR US TO REFOCUS -- ON SOME OF THE BASIC -- UNDERPINNINGS OF WHAT THE PROGRAM IS SUPPOSED TO BE DOING IN TERMS OF PREVENTIVE SCREENINGS AND THAT'S NOT JUST CHILDREN RIGHT -- WE'RE ADDING NOT ONLY THE CHILD METRICS BUT ALSO THE ADULT MEASURES AS WELL TO THE EXTERNAL KIND ABILITY SET -- WE'RE RECOGNIZING THAT WE SERVE A LOT OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS NOT JUST CHILDREN THIS AUDIT CERTAINLY PUT A VERY STRONG EMPHASIS AND HIGHLIGHT ON CHILDREN IT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S -- INTEREST IN DOING ON A LOT OF WORK TO IMPROVE SERVICES IN THIS AREA BUT WE ARE ALSO A PROGRAM THAT SERVES. SENIORS AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITY AND SINGLE CHILDLESS ADULTS AND SO -- A LOT OF THE AUDIT IS GOING TO HAVE RAMIFICATIONS FOR US MORE BROADLY IN TERMS OF HOW WE HOLD THE PLANTS ACCOUNTABLE FOR A VARIETY OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES NOT JUST RELATING TO KIDS -- I KNOW THAT -- CORRECT I GO TO A VARIETY OF THINGS HERE BUT I WE ALSO ALSO HAVE ANOTHER PANEL. TO OTHER STATES SEEM TO BE DOING. THEY HAVE INCENTIVES SAY THAT BUT YOU KNOW STATES LIKE IOWA -- HAWAII LOUISIANA. ARE WE GOING TO IMPLEMENT SOME SORT OF INCENTIVES OR ARE WE GONNA DO SOMETHING PROACTIVE. TO GET OR OR OR IS THIS GOING TO CONTINUE TO DELEGATE TO THE PLANS TO DO THAT TO ME. I THINK WE HEARD FROM THE AUDITOR WAS THAT THE PLANS. DID WHAT THEY WERE BEING. YOU KNOW CHECKING ON THERE BUT THAT WAS AND THAT WASN'T THE FULL PICTURE SO WE'RE GONNA CHECK ON MORE THINGS THAT'S GREAT BUT BUT IS THERE ANY AYE IN ANY AND LOOK AT IT OTHER WAYS TO BE. MORE CREATIVE AND I JUST. YES SIR SORT OF A SORT OF A LACK FOR FOR UNDERSTAND WHY WE WERE SO FAR BEHIND THESE OTHER STATES% SO I THINK SOME OF THE INCENTIVE -- AND INNOVATION IS COMING THROUGH -- VALUE BASED PURCHASING -- WE HAVE NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE AND SO ON YOU KNOW AS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED IN THE LEGISLATRE STILL NEEDS TO AGREE WITH HIS PROPOSAL -- AROUND THAT INITIATIVE -- THAT IS IN SOME CASES OUR INTEREST IN INCENTIVIZING CHANGES AT THE LEVEL IN WHICH THE PATIENT CARE IS DELIVERED -- WE HAVE BEEN. IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE PLANS AROUND DIFFERENT WAYS TO CHANGE THE RATES IN TERMS OF SURE SAY BEANS OR ALLOWING THEM TO KEEP A PORTION. QUALITY OVER A CERTAIN AMOUNT I THINK SOME OF THE CHANGES THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO MAKE IN THE PROGRAM CONSISTENT WITH THE RENEWAL OF OUR WAIVER -- OUR ENTIRE MANAGED CARE PROGRAM IS IN THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE BELIEVE -- THAT WILL COME AS A PART OF THAT DISCUSSION WE'RE CHANGING THE RATE YEAR WE'RE DOING A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS TO STANDARDIZE THE BENEFIT ACROSS THE DIFFERENT. MEDICAL MANAGE CARE MODELS -- WE HAVE A PLAN PROCUREMENT THAT'S COMING UP STARTING NEXT YEAR THERE'S A LOT OF PLACES IN WHICH WE ARE. KIND OF MARCELINE -- AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE PLANS ABOUT PLAN INCENTIVES VERSUS PROVIDERS CENTERS AND THOSE ARE VERY DIFFERENT AND FOR NOW WE'VE CHOSEN TO FOCUS ON THE PROVIDER INCENTIVES -- AND THE PLAN INCENTIVES ARE A CONVERSATION THAT WILL PROBABLY HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF THE WAIVER RENEWAL AND THE CHANGES THAT WERE MAKING IN MANAGED CARE MORE BROADLY. SO WHAT WHAT WHAT'S REASONABLE FOR US TO EXPECT IN THE NEXT YEAR. TWO YEARS. I MEAN WHAT WE GONNA SEE. WHAT METRICS ARE YOU GONNA PUT IN PLACE SO WE CAN MONITOR HOW WELL YOUR YOU GUYS ARE DOING AS A DEPARTMENT -- I WOULD HAVE TO TELL YOU AFTER THIS WHEN I GO BACK AND CHECK WITH THE TEAM IN TERMS OF HOW QUICKLY WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE -- DATA AND INITIAL FEEDBACK ON WHAT THIS MEASUREMENT YEARS GOING TO LOOK LIKE. RIGHT SO THE CHANGES THAT WE ARE MAKING TO THE PLAN ACCOUNTABILITY AND ALL OF THE ADDITION OF THE CHILD AND ADULT COURSE THAT MEASURES. ON IS IN THIS CURRENT MEASURE YEAR I'M NOT SURE ONCE THAT DATA IS SUBMITTED TO US HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR US TO KIND OF AGGREGATED IN A RAW FASHION TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR NOT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OR NOT. I THINK I'M WEIRD LIKE I SAID I'M AND WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE A EVOLVING AND CONTINUING REGULAR CONVERSATION WITH YOU AROUND WHAT WERE SEEN AROUND ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARD REQUEST WE THINK THAT THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE. IN A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT MANNER THIS YEAR EVEN FROM LAST YEAR -- SO I THINK WHAT YOU WILL HEAR FROM US IS AN OPENNESS AND WILLINGNESS TO HAVE AN ONGOING DIALOGUE IN TERMS OF THIS IS THE DATA THAT WE SEE -- THESE ARE THE MEASURES THAT WERE -- STRUGGLING WITH IN TERMS OF WHAT THE PLANS ARE STRUGGLING WITH -- SUMMER BETTER THAN OTHERS RIGHT WE HAVE A DASHBOARD OUR PLANS FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW -- WE CHOOSE DIFFERENT QUALITY MEASURES EVERY QUARTER AND THOSE DASHBOARDS REFLECT PLANS -- AND IN EACH AREA AND SO YOU CAN SEE THE PLANS THAT ARE CONSISTENTLY RANKED AT THE TOP YOU CAN SEE PLANS THAT ARE CONSISTENTLY NOT AT THE TOP -- AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD -- BOTH WELCOME A DIALOGUE WITH AS WELL AS WE'RE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THE DATA TO YOU IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE SEEN AND WHAT. THE PLAN PERFORMANCES AND THEN -- LIKE I SAID THERE'S A LOT OF INTERVENTIONS THAT WE HAVE KIND OF UNDER WAY TO KIND OF IT. CHANGE SOME OF THOSE OUTCOMES. BUT CERTAINLY IN AND UNDERSTANDING AND OPENNESS TO HAVE AND CONTINUE DATA WITH -- DATA SHARING WITH YOU. WHEN I LOOK AND I LOOK FOR TO THAT ACTUALLY FOR TWO MORE DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE TELEMEDICINE PART OF THIS I THINK ESPECIALLY IN? REMOTE RURAL AREAS I THINK THAT'S A REALLY VALUABLE TOOL BUT MY IMPRESSION FROM THE PLANS IS THAT. THAT THAT THERE IS A DISCONNECT THE TERROR THAT THAT. THE DEPARTMENT IS SLOW AND MOVING ON ON ON IMPLEMENTATION -- THAT'S MAYBE I'M PARAPHRASING SO THAT BUT IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE IT'S IF THIS IS NOT A WELL OILED MACHINE HERE ON THAT PART NOT EVEN CLOSE. IT APPEARS I WILL I HAVE I HAVE NOTED THAT IT WILL GO BACK. AND AND WE'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO TALK -- BECAUSE WE CAN PULL. DATA FROM OUR DATA WAREHOUSE NOW AND TELL YOU HOW MANY ENCOUNTERS HAVE BEEN BUILDING A TELEMEDICINE -- BUT SAM MODIFIER SO WE'RE HAPPY TO EVEN JUST TELL YOU WHAT WE HAVE NOW AND TELL YOU WHAT WE HAD LAST YEAR AND SEE WHETHER THAT HAS CHANGED INCREASED REMAINED FLAT. AND THEN OBVIOUSLY IF WE NEED TO RE ITERATE THAT CHANGE IN POLICY WITH THE PLANS -- AND SEE IF THAT CHANGES THE LEVEL OF BOTH ACCEPTANCE ADOPTION AN INTERVENTION -- THAT SOMETHING THAT WERE WHAT CAN YOU DO BECAUSE WE THINK IT MAKES -- SINCE BILLS FOR THE PROVIDER AS WELL AS FOR THE BENEFICIARY IN WHICH CASES. OFTENTIMES IT'S MOST BENEFICIAL FOR THE BENEFICIARY. DOES THE DEPARTMENT EVER MEANS ARE EVER IS YOU HAVE GUIDELINES AND AND THINGS THAT YOU FOLLOW IS THERE EVER FLEXIBILITY TO REFLECT. THE THE UNUSUAL OR OR CHALLENGING NATURE OF CERTAIN GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS OR THESE ARE THE GUIDELINES THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE TO LIVE WITHIN. BUT WAIT A SECOND. I'M IN SISKIYOU COUNTY AND YOU KNOW. IT'S ACCESSING CARE IS REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT. ARE WE ARE WE BOUND BY THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS THE GUIDELINE AND THERE IS NO FLEXIBILITY THERE IS NO ABILITY -- TO LOOK AT AN ALTERNATIVE HERE WITH RESPECT THE FACT THAT. WE DON'T HAVE SOME ALTERNATIVE THIS PERSON'S GONNA HAVE TO TRAVEL FIVE OR SIX HOURS AND WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITH TELEPHONE TELEMEDICINE OR ARE WE KIND OF BOUND BY THESE GUIDELINES I THINK YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY AS A DEPARTMENT -- WE WERE WE TRY REALLY HARD TO BOTH -- WE TRY TO BALANCE FLEXIBILITY WITH -- RESPONSIVENESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- AND SO AND I KNOW THAT THE AUDITOR SAID THIS IN HER PREVIOUS COMMENTS AND THAT -- SHE FELT THAT WE DELEGATED TO MUCH TO THE PLANS -- IN SOME CASES WHEN WE DELEGATE TO THE PLANS WE ARE OFTEN SAYING WE IN SACRAMENTO DON'T KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING AND SISKIYOU COUNTY AND SO IF THE PLAN IS SAYING. HEY I'VE GOT BENEFICIARIES THAT IT'S CHEAPER EASIER AND FASTER FOR ME TO HAVE THEM GO TO NEVADA -- AND I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SEND THEM TO NEVADA INSTEAD OF TO SOMEWHERE IN CALIFORNIA WE DO DEFERRED OF THE PLANS BECAUSE THEY ARE ON THE GROUND AND UNDERSTANDS TRAVEL PATTERNS AND PROVIDER ARRANGEMENTS IN CONTRACTING -- THAT BEING SAID SO WE WE VALUE FLEXIBILITY WHEN WE CAN PROVIDE IT WHEN IT IS BENEFICIAL TO THE BENEFICIARY AND WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE. IF THE FLEXIBILITY MEANS THAT IT IS NOT ACCRUING TO THE BENEFICIARIES. BENEFIT THEN NOW -- YOU KNOW WE DON'T WANT TO BE FLEXIBLE IN THAT AREA AND SO FOR TELEMEDICINE PURPOSES -- WE LOOK MAKE THINGS MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THEM AND TO THE EXTENT THAT IT HELPS THE PLAN ALSO MADE ITS NETWORK -- STANDARDS THAT AS A AS ADDITIONAL BENEFIT BUT THAT'S NOT THE REASON THAT WE'RE DOING IT WE'RE DOING IT BECAUSE WE WANT THE BENEFICIARY TO BE ABLE. TO RECEIVE IT IN THE MOST CONVENIENT WAY POSSIBLE -- IF TELEMEDICINE'S THE CASE GREAT IF IT'S NOT THEN IT'S SOMETHING ELSE -- THE CHANGE IN THE TRANSPORTATION BENEFIT A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WAS DONE FOR A REASON -- THE PLANS NOW HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION BOTH MEDICAL. NON EMERGENCY MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION AS WELL AS NON MEDICAL TRANSPORTATION THE TWO WERE DIFFERENT -- FOR ALL OF THEIR MEMBERSREGARDLESS OF THE SERVICE THAT THEY'RE GETTING WHETHER OR NOT THAT SERVICES THE PLANT'S RESPONSIBILITY OR NOT. OUR MANAGED CARE PLANS HAVE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION TO DENTAL SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE OR TO SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. AND SO THAT WAS REALLY OUR EFFORT AN INTENTION TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE BENEFICIARY TO GET TO THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED AND IF TRANSPORTATION WAS THE PROBLEM THAT WE WERE PUTTING THE PLANS FULLY IN CHARGE OF PAYING FOR THAT TRANSPORTATION AND THAT HAS CERTAINLY BEEN A BENEFIT. THAT WE HAVE HEARD -- AND WE WILL SEE CERTAINLY IN OUR RATE -- TEMPLATE THAT THAT HAS BEEN USED IN A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT WAY AND THAT WAS THE INTENTION IS WE WANT TRANSPORTATION USED IF IT IF THAT'S THE CHANGE THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN. SO I THINK -- THERE'S A LIKE I SAID EACH. EACH -- CHALLENGE AN OPPORTUNITY IN OUR PROGRAM REQUIRES INTERVENTIONS AT DIFFERENT LEVELS AT DIFFERENT TIMES FROM DIFFERENT ENTITIES IN DIFFERENT PLACES BUT WE TRY REALLY HARD TO BE REASONABLE AND A PLANE COMES WORKING FOR ME. AND I NEED YOU TO MAKE THIS MODIFICATION. TO THE CONTRACTOR THE BENEFIT -- WE TRY REALLY HARD TO DO THAT IF IT MAKES SENSE -- WE HAVE PLANS THAT HAVE. UNIQUE FEATURES -- YOU KNOW I LIKE TO USE -- HEALTH PLAN OF SAN MATTEO WHICH IS A GREAT PLAN -- THEY PAY FOR ANTI PSYCHOTICS EVEN THOUGH NO OTHER PLAN IN THE STATE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROVISION OF ANTI PSYCHOTICS IT'S A CARVED OUT BENEFIT TO FEE FOR SERVICE. DON'T ASK ME WHY HEALTH PLAN SO MATTEO PAYS FOR ANTI PSYCHOTICS AND DON'T ASK ME WHY WE AGREED TO ALLOW THEM TO PAY FOR ANTI PSYCHOTICS BUT THEY DO. AND THERE'S PROBABLY SOME HISTORY AS TO WHY THAT OCCURRED -- SO WE DO THERE'S TONS OF THOSE LITTLE EXAMPLES BURIED IN OUR PROGRAM WHERE WE HAVE MADE ALLOWANCES AND CHANGES AND FLEXIBILITY -- SOME OF THAT MAY NEED TO CHANGE JUST GIVEN THE BROADER GOALS THAT WE HAVE BUT WE DO LIKE TO THINK OF OURSELVES AS TRYING TO DO RIGHT BY THE BENEFICIARY WHEN SOMEONE COMES AND ASKS FOR US TO DO THAT. AND FINALLY I APOLOGIZE I KNOW A LOT OF QUESTIONS BUT THAT'S JUST MY NATURE -- ARE THERE TIMES I MEAN YOU YOU SAID I WAS THE PLANS HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY FOR TRANSPORTATION -- TO CERTAIN KINDS OF APPOINTMENTS -- AT THE BELIEVE I'VE HEARD ENOUGH I'M AND I'M NOT I DON'T BELIEVE IN MAKING THIS UP BUT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN THE PLAN PAYS MORE IN TRANSPORTATION. IN THE CONSULTATION WOULD HAVE COSTED -- AND SO. HOW OFTEN DOES THE PLAN HAVE THE ABILITY TO THEN -- CONTRACT WITH SOMEONE LOCAL SO THAT THAT THAT IF ISSUE DOESN'T HAVE TO DO THAT. AND WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A MORE COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF DOING THINGS SOMETIMES -- SO DID IT DEPENDS RIGHT SO IT DEPENDS ON THE CONSULTATION -- IF A BENEFICIARY NEEDS TO BE SEEN BY A CERTAIN SPECIALTY PROVIDER AND THAT SPECIALTY PROVIDER IS. A HUNDRED MILES AWAY THEN THE PLAN HAS TO PAY FOR THAT BENEFIT SURE TO GET THERE IF THEY OTHERWISE DON'T HAVE. TRANSPORTATION TO DO THAT EVEN IF IT COSTS MORE TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE THE PLAN IS RESPONSIBLE TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICE -- IS DONE BY THE APPROPRIATE PROVIDER IF SOMEONE NEEDS TO SEE A CARDIOLOGISTS. THEN THE PLAN HAS TO PAY TO GET THEM TO SEE THAT CARDIOLOGISTS -- IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THEM TO SEE A G. P. -- WHEN A CARDIOLOGISTS IS THE INDIVIDUAL THAT NEEDS TO BE SEEN THAT PATIENT AND SO IT REALLY KIND OF DEPENDS ON A PATIENT BY PATIENT BASIS BUT -- THE PLAN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSPORTATION -- BUT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A RATE PROCESS AND WHICH PLANS ACCOUNT FOR THE COSTS. AND THE AND PROVIDING THOSE VARIOUS SERVICES AND THEN OUR ACTUARIES INCORPORATE THAT INTO THE RATE GOING FORWARD. SO THERE'S A THERE'S AN ACCOUNTING FOR THAT COST -- IN THEIR RATE TEMPLATES. SO THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS REQUIRED TO EAT THE LOS THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY WE'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF YOUR AS WELL AND I APOLOGIZE I THOUGHT THAT WAS -- THAT THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN WHEN THE BENEFICIARY IS TRAVELING TO A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER AND THEY'RE HAVING TO DO THAT. THEY HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING THAT THERE ARE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ALONG THE WAY -- BUT THAT DOESN'T FEEL VERY HELPFUL TO THE BENEFICIARY -- SO WAS THE PLAN THAT JUST READ THE IS IS IT UP TO THEM TO SAY WE'RE JUST GONNA TRY TO WE WERE NOT GOING TO CONTRACT WE'RE GOING TO WE'RE GOING TO SEND THAT PERSON WITH A CONTRACT -- WE WE CAN'T CONTRACT BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET THE RATES THAT WILL BRING THAT PROVIDER ON YEAH AND AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO THE SPECIFICS OF THE GEOGRAPHY -- YOU KNOW. WERE ALWAYS CLEAR TO SAY -- PLANTS HAVE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO ALL MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICES I DO THE APPROPRIATE PROVIDER -- AND THAT'S BOTH PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CARE -- THEY DON'T HAVE TO GUARANTEE ACCESS TO A PARTICULAR PROVIDER SO IF A BENEFICIARY SAID I REALLY LIKE -- DOCTOR BOB HE'S FANTASTIC AND I WANT TO SEE DOCTOR BOB AND IF THE PLAN DOESN'T HAVE A CONTRACT WITH DOCTOR BOB. THE PLAN HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BENEFITS SURE HAS ACCESS TO A PROVIDER OF EQUAL -- SPECIALTY EXPERTISE BE IT. YOU KNOW WHATEVER DOCTOR BOB IS BUT IF TALK ABOUT REFUSES TO CONTRACT -- THAN THE PLAN DOESN'T HAVE TO SEND THE BENEFICIARY THERE UNLESS. IF DOCTOR BOB IS THE ONLY PROVIDER OF THAT SPECIALTY TYPE IN WHICH THE PATIENT HAS TO BE SEEN BY HIM BECAUSE THERE IS NO ONE ELSE THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO THAT. THEN THE PLAN HAS TO SEND THE BENEFITS YOU THERE AND PAY OUT OF NETWORK GREAT. THAT'S THE WAY THE CONTRACT WORKS AND THAT'S THE WAY THE ACCESS WORKS. SO THE PLAN HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE -- THEY TRY VERY HARD OBVIOUSLY TO MAKE THEM AVAILABLE IN NETWORK BUT FOR INSTANCES IN WHICH PROVIDERS REFUSED TO CONTRACT -- THEN THEY HAVE TO SEND THE BENEFICIARY REGARDLESS FOR PRIMARY CARE -- I WOULD SAY I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIT LESS OF AN ISSUE JUST BECAUSE THE BACKBONE OF OUR PRIMARY CASH CARE SYSTEM IS THROUGH FQHCS AND RURAL HEALTH CLINICS AND SO. EVEN IN AREAS -- SUCH AS YOURS THAT THEY THERE SO THEY STILL MAY NEED TO TRAVEL BUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN FQHC BOTH CONTRACTING AND TAKING THOSE PATIENTS IS IS PROBABLY NOT AS MUCH OF AN ISSUE AS IT WOULD BE LIKE A SPECIALTY PROVIDER THAT JUST SIMPLY DOESN'T EXIST OUT THERE [inaudible] THANK YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU I ORDERED A MOVE TO CENTER MORE LACK OF BOOKS THAT ARE MORE LIKE HAS CLOSED. THANK YOU MISTER. JUST THAT THAT YOU MAY ALREADY COVERED THIS I APOLOGIZE FOR COMMINGLED. WITH WITH A WONDERFUL AFTERNOON CALENDAR HELLO BUT HEAVY HELLO MISS CAN'T HOW ARE YOU GOOD HOW ARE YOU I'M PLUGGING ALONG -- I I CERTAINLY CAL OPTIMA BOARD AN ORANGE COUNTY FOR FOUR YEARS AS WELL BACK IN THE OLD DAYS WHEN WE HAD TO WAIT FOR THE BUDGET. TO BE APPROVED LIKE IN AUGUST SEPTEMBER SOMETIMES OCTOBER. BUT A ONE OF THE KEY FINDINGS IS THAT -- MANY FAMILIES DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS DUE IN PART TO LOW MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT RATES. SOME OF THE LOWEST IN THE NATION AND SO WE EXPERIENCE THAT WHEN THERE WAS A BUDGET CRISIS SERVE RECESSION. THE THE THE THE DOCTORS WOULD GET A 10% CUT IN JUST SEEM LIKE THAT HAPPENED A COUPLE TIMES I'M JUST WONDERING SINCE THE RECESSION HAVE. THOSE CUTS BEEN RESTORED AND AND AND HAVE WE GOTTEN BACK UP. TO STATE. TWO THOUSAND FIVE LEVELS AND WHAT ARE THE BUDGET. PROPOSALS THAT YOU'LL BE MAKING TO MAYBE RAISE THE RATES SO WE CAN. COMPENSATE OUR MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS A LITTLE BETTER SURE THAT'S A IT IS A MULTI -- STAGE QUESTIONS SO I WILL I WILL TRY AND ADDRESS AT ALL -- SO THE AB NINETY SEVEN CUT THE 10% -- PHYSICIAN CUT HAS NOT BEEN RESTORED -- SO THAT IS STILL -- IN A FAX -- IN FEE FOR SERVICE AS WELL AS THERE'S A WE CARRY THAT THAT -- REDUCTION IN THE MANAGED CARE RATES BUT IT'S IT'S TREATED A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY SO LET ME ADDRESS THAT SEPARATELY -- THE AB NINETY SEVEN CUTS HAVE BEEN RESTORED IN CERTAIN AREAS -- THE LEGISLATURE MOST NOTABLY RESTORED THE DENTAL CUT. IN -- TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN SO THAT WAS RESTORED BUT IN THE PHYSICIAN SIDE THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN RESTORED -- WHEN PEOPLE TALK ABOUT MEDICARE RATES BEING SOME OF THE LOWEST IN THE COUNTRY THEY'RE USUALLY REFERRING TO THE FEE FOR SERVICE SCHEDULE -- SO IN FEE FOR SERVICE WE HAVE RATES ESTABLISH FOR CERTAIN CODES AND THEY LOOK AT THOSE CODES AND THEY SAY IT'S YOU KNOW STANDARD EXAM CODE IS. FIFTY DOLLARS AND SO THEREFORE THAT SLOWER THAN ANY OTHER STATE -- IN MANAGED CARE THE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND THE ACTUARIAL RATES THAT WE SET ARE NOT TETHERED OR TIED IN ANY WAY TO THE FEE FOR SERVICE RATE SCHEDULE. SO PLANS HAVE -- RATES THAT ARE BUILT ON THEIR ENCOUNTERS THEIR COSTS THEIR UTILIZATION OF SERVICES -- AND THOSE DO NOT REFLECT NECESSARILY WHAT THE FEE FOR SERVICE RATES ARE SO PLANS AND I HAVE BEEN IN THIS -- COMMITTEE ROOM ONE PLANS OF TESTIFIED THAT THEY PAY A 100% OF MEDICARE OR THEY PAY ABOVE MEDICARE RATES FOR CERTAIN SERVICES WITH CERTAIN PROVIDERS. AND THAT IS FINE -- WE ALLOW IT -- WE ACCOUNT FOR IT WHEN THEY TURN IN THEIR RATE -- DATA TO US AS WE BUILD THEIR RATES ONGOING WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE MITIGATION STRATEGIES AND PLACE SUCH THAT. A PLANE COULDN'T JUST SAY I'M GOING TO BE. REALLY GENEROUS AND GIVE. YOU KNOW 4100% OF MEDICARE TO EVERYONE BECAUSE WE DO SOME COUNTY ADJUSTMENTS AND WE HAVE SOME OTHER THINGS -- IN PLACE BUT PLANS HAVE TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE NETWORK AND IN ORDER FOR THEM TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE NETWORK THEY HAVE TO PAY RATES AND WHICH PROVIDERS ARE WILLING TO CONTRACT WITH THEM. THAT IS IN NO WAY -- BEING IMPACTED BY THE FEE FOR SERVICE RATE SCHEDULE AND SO THOSE TWO ARE HANDLED VERY DIFFERENTLY AS AS WE SAT RATES AND SO. I'M HOPING THAT THAT ADDRESSES YOUR QUESTION IN SOME PART JUST BECAUSE IF YOU ARE A PLAN AND YOU ARE CONTRACTING WITH PROVIDERS. THE NEGOTIATION AND THE CONTRACTS AND THE FINANCING THAT FLOWS IS IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN -- OTHER PARTS OF THE OF THE PROGRAM. SO WE'RE AT ENJOYING MAYBE A BUDGET SURPLUS AND SO OUR NEW GOVERNOR IS. FOUND A LOT OF PLACES TO PUT TWENTY ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS I'M JUST WONDERING DID YOU WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS A EIGHT WE'VE GOT TO START [inaudible] HELPING. OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS SO THAT WE CAN MEET. NO GROUP OF PEOPLE IN THE STATE ONE IN FIVE THEIR EVERY LEVEL. THIS IS THIS WOULD BE A GOOD PRIORITY WAS WILL WAS THAT DONE YEAH SO THERE'S SEVERAL PLACES -- THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH -- DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE ADMINISTRATION MORE BROADLY AROUND THE APPLICATION OF THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDS -- SO -- THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE FUNDS AS AN ADDITIVE AND A SUPPLEMENTAL AMOUNT COMPARED TO THE BASE FUNDING THAT THE GENERAL FUND PAYS -- FOR CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED RIGHT THEY HAVE BEEN TARGETED THEY HAVE BEEN -- AIMED AT PLACES IN THE PROGRAM THAT WE FELT NEEDED THE MOST -- HELP SO NOT ONLY FOR PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS BUT PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDS HAVE BEEN USED FOR HIV AIDS WAIVER AGENCIES FOR INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED. FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES FOR PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE -- THERE WERE SOME TARGETED FUNDS LAST YEAR PROVIDED FOR SEA BASS DISABILITIES AND OTHERS AND SO -- WE HAVE A BIG PROGRAM AND WE LARGELY LOOK AT AREAS IN WHICH WE FEEL -- ACCESSES -- PROBLEMATIC LAST YEAR THERE WAS A HOME HEALTH -- RATE INCREASE FOR HOME HEALTH AGENCIES A 50% RATE INCREASE THAT WAS -- BOTH PROPOSED AND APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE. SO I WOULD SAY THAT THOSE ARE -- THE DEPARTMENTS -- AREAS IN WHICH WE HAVE BOTH SIDES AND HAD AGREEMENT THAT RATE AUGMENTATIONS AND INCREASES WERE APPROPRIATE AND SO THAT IS ALL ACCORDING TO THE BENEFIT OF THE BENEFICIARY ULTIMATELY. GREETING JUST A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS -- YOU HAVE SOFTWARE TO MONITOR ALL OF I WILL LIKE TO SOFTWARE. I SO WE HAVE LOTS OF SOFTWARE WE HAVE IS. TO TO HANDLE THE JOB BECAUSE WE GET SO MANY. SAD STORIES ABOUT SOFTWARE SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOUR IDEAS YES. YES MY CHALLENGES -- IT KNOWLEDGE MEANT -- EARLIER -- WE HAVE CHALLENGES AND THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AREA -- WITHIN OUR ENTERPRISE AT THE DEPARTMENT WE HAVE OVER A HUNDRED DISTINCT IT SYSTEMS -- AND SO THE CONTINUED EVOLUTION OF THOSE SYSTEMS -- AND THE PROCESS BY WHICH THAT GETS DONE IS CHALLENGING -- IT IS LONG -- SOMETIMES IT HAS OVERSIGHT BY BOTH THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- AND THEN WE BECAUSE WE'RE MEDICAID AGENCY WE HAVE TWO AND WE'RE USING FEDERAL FUNDS WE HAVE OVERSIGHT PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR I. T. PROJECTS. SO I KNOW THAT -- WE HAVE A LOT OF SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS THAT -- NEED TO BE UPDATED SOME OF THOSE ARE IN PROCESS SO MEDS IS OUR DATABASE OF RECORD IT'S OVER FORTY YEARS OLD IT'S A COBALT DATABASE. AND IT IS THE BACKBONE OF OUR ENTIRE PROGRAM -- AND SO. IF YOU'RE WILLING TO INDULGE A JOKE ON MEDS I LIKE TO SAY THAT IT IS -- EXTRAORDINARILY SAFE BECAUSE NO ONE HAS FIGURED OUT HOW TO HACK A COUPLE -- AND THAT WHEN WE NEED PROGRAMMERS WE RECRUIT RECRUIT FROM SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES SO THERE'S MY MEDS DATABASE JOKE BUT I. T. IS A CHALLENGE FOR US AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE STRUGGLE WITH AND WE WISH WE WERE FASTER. AT BEING ABLE TO MODIFIER SYSTEMS -- SOME OF THAT IS JUST THE NATURE OF STATE LARGE STATE I. T. PROJECTS -- THAT YOU KNOW ARE SIGNIFICANT IN NATURE AND SO -- THE PROGRAMMING AROUND RATE INCREASES HAS CERTAINLY BEEN SLOW -- BECAUSE WE HAVE A AGAIN A SYSTEM THAT DOES OUR CLAIMS FOR FEE FOR SERVICE AND PROGRAMMING THAT SOME TAKE SOMETIMES TAKES UP TO A YEAR. IN ORDER THE MONEY'S GOOD IT FLOWS BACK TO THE DATE THAT THE RATE INCREASE WAS PROVIDED BUT IN SOME CASES THAT LACK HAS BEEN. YOU KNOW SIX NINE TEN MONTHS AND SO WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND WEIRD. WE HAVE THAT ON ON THE SCHEDULE TO IMPROVE AND AND MODERNIZE THAT SYSTEM. SO LAST QUESTION AND MAYBE FIFTY WORDS OR LESS. WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION OR OF OF THE AUDIT -- YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE GETTING OUT IT'S LIKE THIS -- I LIKE TO THINK THAT OUR PROGRAM IS CONSTANTLY IMPROVING -- THIS WAS CERTAINLY -- AUDIT IN WHICH WE ACKNOWLEDGE AND NEED TO DO BETTER -- AND SO WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT -- IN SOME CASES I THINK THAT -- IT WAS A FAIR -- ASSESSMENT OF THE DATA AND SO YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T FAULT THE DATA AND SO WE ARE LOOKING AHEAD AS TO HOW WE IMPROVE HOW WE HOLD OUR PLANS ACCOUNTABLE HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT SERVICES ARE ARE BEING DELIVERED TO THE FAMILIES AND THE CHILDREN THAT WE SERVE AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING BETTER. THANK YOU MS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU AND TERM OR LACKEY ONE OF THE THINGS IN THE US ABOUT THE BUDGET EARLIER. ONE OF THE THINGS I FOUND FASCINATING AND THIS YEAR'S BUDGET COMPARED TO A PREVIOUS YEARS BUDGETS AS ALL THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX MONEY RIGHT NOW IS ALLOCATED ACTUALLY TO HELP TOWARDS -- MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES WERE BEFORE IT WAS DIVVIED UP. SO TO YOUR PREVIOUS QUESTION WHAT THAT WILL MOVE TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN WATER. THANK YOU I'M JUST REALLY BRIEFLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PRIORITY OF MINE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT -- CHILDREN ESPECIALLY IN WITH VARYING ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS -- THAT THEIR PARENTS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS CARE. IN NAVIGATE A VERY COMPLEX SYSTEM THAT EVEN FOR US WITH INSURANCES HARD TO NAVIGATE -- AND TALK ABOUT THE HEALTH DISPARITIES YOU KNOW BETWEEN ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS AND ACCESSING -- HOW YOU KNOW BEYOND MAILINGS TO THEM AND IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES BECAUSE SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO EVEN GET THAT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ACTUAL CARE GIVER -- WHAT WE IS COULD THAT BE IMPROVED AS FAR AS BEING ABLE TO TARGET? YOU KNOW -- COMMUNITIES OR PEOPLE WHO NEED TO ACCESS CARE WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT CRAP EARLIER THE DROP OFF IN A YEAR ONE AND YEAR TWO WE WERE SAYING WELL OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THOSE YEARS IN BETWEEN BEFORE THEY START PRESCHOOL. YOU KNOW WHEN IT'S KINDA KICKS BACK UP WAS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT YEAH I REMEMBER WHEN MY SON WAS BORN WE GOT A LOT OF STUFF. IN THE MAIL FROM YOU KNOW EVEN YOU KNOW PAMPERS OR JANE JAY OR WHATEVER WOULD SEND US WITH SAMPLES AND THEY ALWAYS INCLUDE THE VACCINE SCHEDULE OR MAKE SURE YOU HAVE YOUR WELL BABY. BUT THEN AFTER THAT IT KIND OF DROPPED OFF. UNTIL WE START SCHOOL IN IN THIS MORE OF A SOCIAL NETWORK YOU'RE EVEN TO THE THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OR DAY CARE OR WHATEVER. HOW WHAT WAYS CAN THAT IMPROVE THAT YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY SEEING THE PRIMARY CARE OR A PEDIATRICIAN? THAT. THERE'S A WAY TO COMMUNICATE IN THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY KNOW SO THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY. NAVIGATION AND YEAH SO I THINK THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR OTHER SISTER DEPARTMENTS -- YOU KNOW DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS IT PERTAINS TO THE BLACK INFANT HEALTH PROGRAM. DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES WHICH SERVES A LOT OF CAO WORKS FAMILIES AND HOME VISITING -- I THINK THAT -- DEPENDING ON THE DISPARITY THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS -- THERE ARE SOMETIMES -- APPROPRIATE AND IS CRITICAL -- INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN BE PROVIDED THROUGH LIKE -- THERE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT DOULAS -- TO HELP IMPROVE -- BIRTH RATES IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY FROM A TODAS -- IN THE LATINO COMMUNITY -- CERTAINLY AROUND -- ASTHMA DIABETES SOMETIMES THE CULTURAL -- DIVIDE BETWEEN A A BENEFICIARY AND THE PHYSICIANS OFFICE IS JUST TOO SIGNIFICANT AND THEY'RE NOT COMFORTABLE TALKING TO THEIR PROVIDER AT OR AND WE'VE REALLY BEEN STRUGGLING IN THE MENTAL HEALTH AREA RIGHT THERE ARE CERTAIN. COMMUNITIES THAT ARE JUST NOT COMFORTABLE ACKNOWLEDGING OR SEEKING MEDICAL OUR MISSILE HEALTH CARE AND SO I THINK -- OUR INTEREST AS A PROGRAM IS LOOKING AT BOTH TRADITIONAL PROVIDERS THAT SERVE THAT COMMUNITY -- AS WELL AS ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS THAT CAN HELP ASSIST IN TERMS OF MAKING BENEFICIARIES FEEL COMFORTABLE ARE HELPING DO. PATIENT AT EDUCATION NAVIGATION SUPPORT AND SO DEPENDING ON THE DISPARITY THAT YOU'RE TRYING -- TO ADDRESS THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS IN WHICH WE WOULD DO IT BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY SAY IT'S A IT'S A MUCH MORE LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION APPROACH AND IN MY MIND I DON'T THINK IT'S A STATE -- BASED WAY IN THE END UNLESS WE'RE JUST PAIN TO HELP SUPPORT THAT EFFORT AT A LOCAL LEVEL. THANK YOU. AND IF I COULD JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT QUESTION SO WOULD DCH US THEN BE REQUIRING THE PLANS TO COME UP WITH. A WAY TO GET AT THESE CULTURAL DISPARITIES THAT WERE OUTLINED IN THE AUDIT YOU KNOW I KNOW BACK HOME YOU MENTIONED IT TO YOU -- THE FROM WITHOUT US RIGHT THAT'S A GOOD PROGRAM THAT I SEE THAT GETS OUT THERE TO TRY TO GET SOME OF THIS INFORMATION -- BUT IS THIS SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE S. IS NOW MOVING TOWARDS MORE TALKING ABOUT -- PERFORMANCE STANDARDS OR MAYBE REQUIRING -- THE THE PLANTS TO DO THIS YES SO I THINK PART OF THE MULTITUDE OF THINGS THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH THE PLANS ON TO HELP ADDRESS THESE -- AREAS AROUND THE AUDIT WAS THE THERE'S A HEALTH DISPARITIES REPORT AND PLANS ARE REQUIRED TO DO GROUP NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND THEY DEVELOP THEIR OWN SPECIFIC EVALUATION REPORT I THINK THAT. EACH PLAYER AS A PART OF THEIR CONTRACT WITH US ARE REQUIRED TO DO QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PRO -- PROJECTS AND SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY PLANS IN THE PAST AND I THINK WE WOULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT ENCOURAGE -- AND HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE TO DO MORE OF THAT IN TERMS OF HOW DO YOU ADDRESS DISPARITIES WITHIN YOUR OWN PLAN SO WE'RE REQUIRING THE PLANS TO LOOK AT THEIR MEMBERSHIP AND SAY WE SEE DISPARITIES IN -- MEDICATION MANAGEMENT FOR HYPERTENSION AND BECAUSE WE SEE THAT -- THAT YOU KNOW -- Là MAKING THIS UP -- YOU KNOW OUR POPULATION WITHIN THIS PLAN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN POPULATION IS NOT CONSISTENTLY -- KEEPING UP WITH ITS MEDICATION MANAGEMENT THE SAME WAY THAT OTHER POPULATIONS ARE WE WOULD BE LOOKING TO THE PLAN TO BOTH IDENTIFY THAT AS A NEED AND THEN TO COME TO US WITH A VERY SPECIFIC WAY AND HOW THEY WANT TO ADDRESS THAT. IS SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KIND OF QUALITY -- BOTH OUTCOMES AND FOLLOW UP THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE BUT WE'RE LOOKING TO BE BOTH MORE CONSISTENT AND MORE INTENTIONAL AND HOW WE FOLLOW THE PLANS AS THEY DO THOSE ACTIVITIES ON THEIR OWN. YEAH AND I APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE I REMEMBER A LOT OF REPORTED EVEN TALK ABOUT AFRICAN AMERICANS ONLY BEING AT 40% UTILIZATION. FOR FOR SOME THINGS ARE REFERENCING RIGHT WHAT THAT WAS COULD WE'VE TO ASSEMBLY WOMAN ACT. I THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR EVERYONE FOR THE PARTICIPATION TODAY. YOU JUST MAY JUST SOMEONE JUST KIND OF PUT A RED FLAG UP ON ME IN THAT WAS THAT -- YOU HAVE NUMEROUS SOFTWARE SYSTEMS THAT YOU ARE WORKING WITH. AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE INTEGRATION OF ALL THOSE. IT MIGHT BE WORKING FOR YOU TODAY. I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE IN FIVE YEARS. AND PARTICULARLY WHEN WE LOOK AT SOFTWARE -- AND UPGRADES AND CHANGES IS A SUMMER INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE PEOPLE WILL BE LIVING. RETIRING. AND I ALWAYS AND FEARFUL WHEN I HEAR THAT SOMEONE IS GOING TO WAIT AND THAT'S NOT. A TOP PRIORITY RIGHT AWAY A MAYBE IT IS BUT I'M CONCERNED THAT THE LONGER WE WAIT THE INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE IS GONE. TO ACTUALLY HELPED IMPLEMENT A GOOD SOFTWARE SYSTEM IT'S GOING TO BE RUN AND RUNNING AND ROBUST. FOR THE DEPARTMENT SO -- DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON THAT OR THANK YOU -- AND AND MY CHAU SEARS ARE PROBABLY BURNING AS I INVOKE HIS NAME -- SO THERE IS -- A POLICY THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PUT FORWARD TO MEDICAID AGENCIES IN PARTICULAR AROUND -- ENTERPRISE MANAGEMENT SO -- MY TO IS THE MEDICAID INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE -- AND WE ASA STATE WHEN WE ARE CLAIMING ENHANCE FEDERAL FUNDS TO DO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS. IN THE PROCESS OF SEEKING THOSE ENHANCED FUNDS -- WE HAVE TO BASICALLY DEMONSTRATE THE BROADER APPLICABILITY TO LARGER. AND LARGER PORTIONS OF OUR ENTERPRISE MEANING THEY DON'T WANT US TO COME AND JUST SAY I'M LOOKING. TO DO ONE SYSTEM FOR THIS ONE THING THEY WANT TO SEE A A BROADER -- PROPOSAL THAT INCORPORATES -- LARGER PARTS OF THE PROGRAM AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT JUST -- SILO IN ALL OF THE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY. AND SO -- THOSE FOR FUNDS ARE SUCH THAT IT IS -- HARD FOR STATES TO NOT DO THAT IT'S A NINETY TEN MATCH SO -- WE HAVE -- A SERIES OF CONSISTENT -- IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS THAT WE'RE DOING -- TO LOOK MORE BROADLY I WOULD -- NOTE THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE THREE CURRENT -- ELIGIBILITY SYSTEMS THE CONSORTIUM AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SAID -- AND THEY ARE ON TRACK TO DO THIS BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE IS TO CONSOLIDATE THOSE INTO A SINGLE SYSTEM FOR THE STATE SO THERE WILL BE A SINGLE STATEWIDE COUNTY CONSORTIUM SYSTEM -- WHICH IS A LOT OF WORK -- IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A LOT OF CHANGE THEY HAVE REALLY -- EMBRACED IT AND WE ARE KIND OF MOVING THROUGH THAT PROCESS OF HOW DO YOU TURN THOSE SYSTEMS INTO A SINGLE SYSTEM BUT YOUR POINT IS ABSOLUTELY WELL TAKEN AND I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REALLY EMBRACE WHEN I WAS THE DIRECTOR -- WHEN I FIRST STARTED TWENTY FIFTEEN IS? THERE'S ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT HAS TO BE BUILT IF THE PROGRAM ITSELF IS GOING TO BE STABLE. TEN TWENTY THIRTY YEARS FROM NOW AND SO -- IT'S NOT PARTICULARLY EXCITING FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE BUT I ACTUALLY HAVE SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME -- ON I. T. JUST BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE THAT IT EXISTS LONG AFTER ANY OF US ARE IN THESE POSITIONS BUT RISK AND SO I THINK A LOT OF US -- SPEND A LOT OF TIME WORKING IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA. WELL AS WE KNOW WE'VE HAD PROJECTS WITHIN THE STATE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL OF HIM. UPGRADES AND CHANGES THE SOFTWARE I I DON'T WANT TO BE ONE OF THOSE DEPARTMENTS YEAH. I DON'T EITHER BUT I JUST THINK WE NEED TO BE REALLY VISIONARY AND TO FACE THE FACT THAT THESE THINGS TAKE SOME TIME. ON THE SHOULDN'T TAKE THAT MUCH TIME BUT YOU KNOW INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE DOESN'T ALWAYS WANT TO GIVE OUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE. AND IT SLOWS DOWN A PROJECT AND I'VE BEEN -- INVOLVE SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS IN THE PAST AND IT WAS VERY FRUSTRATING SO -- THE SOONER WE GET THOSE PEOPLE THAT THINK TO GET ON BOARD TO HELP BEFORE THE GUN -- RETIRE WHATEVER THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL BUT I HAVE TO ONE WOMAN IN MY I. T. SHOP WHO HAS BEEN WITH US SINCE. NINETEEN SIXTY NINE AND WE HAVE HER ON VIDEO SHE HAS TOLD US. EVERYTHING THERE IS TO KNOW -- SHE IS LOVELY AND SHE'S A RETIRED SHE CAME BACK AS A RETIRED ANNUITANT BUT SHE IS ACTUALLY HELPING LEAD. A LOT OF THE WORK AROUND HOW DO YOU EVOLUTION EYES AND MODERNIZE THE SYSTEM THAT SHE HERSELF CREATED BACK IN THE EIGHTIES -- AND IT IS. IT IS REMARKABLE AND SHE'S SHE'S REMARKABLE BUT I I HEAR YOU BECAUSE I HAVE THAT EMPLOYEE IN MY DEPARTMENT [inaudible] THANK YOU. RIGHT WITH THAT. I BELIEVE MISTER WHAT HAS THE FINAL THE FINAL QUESTION SORRY IF I COULD JUST. MAKE ONE REMARK JUST YOU KNOW. H. TESTIMONY HERE FOR THE INCREASED -- ACCOUNTABILITY AND PERFORMANCE METRICS I KNOW -- ME DOCTOR WOULD HAVE TALKED ABOUT THIS SEEING THE SIXTY DAY AND AND THE THE PROGRESS REPORTS AS A START COMING OUT BUT YOU KNOW THE I THINK I HEARD FROM YOU MAKING LANS A LITTLE MORE ACCOUNTABLE. INCREASING THAT ACCOUNTABILITY AND THERE WAS NOTHING THAT YOU DISAGREED WITH THAT WAS IN THE AUDIT REPORT -- DO YOU THINK YOU SAID IT WAS FAIR. BALANCED AND SO LOOK FOR THAT MISTER WHAT HAS THE COUPLE QUESTIONS YEAH -- CLOSE PANEL THAT YEAH AS AS TALK AS QUESTIONS GET ANSWERED IT IT'S THAT SPURS OTHER THOUGHTS AND AND OTHER QUESTIONS AND ONE WAS YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT THAT OBVIOUSLY PLANS HAVE THE ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE WITH SOME OTHER PROVIDERS FOR FOR SOME THESE CONTRACTS. AND THEN YOU SAID YOU THAT COMS BACK AS PART OF A REVIEW. OF LATER ON SO. DOES THE DEPARTMENT SAY WELL YOU GUYS BEEN PAYING TOO MUCH AND JUST TO PUT THE THUMB ON THE SCALES THERE -- OR HOW DOES HOW DOES THAT WORK -- IN IN THAT ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE THOSE ARE RATES THAT ARE OBVIOUSLY HIGHER. THAN THAN WHAT THE TYPICAL ALLOWANCE WOULD BE SO. I'M GONNA GET MYSELF INTO TROUBLE -- AND MY RATES PEOPLE WILL PROBABLY. TAKE UMBRAGE AT THIS. SO THERE'S EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNTS OF DATA THAT COME TO US -- AND THE RATE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS FROM THE PLANS -- ACROSS A VARIETY OF AREAS HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT PHARMACY. DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT ALL THE DIFFERENT RATE AREAS -- AND SO TO THE EXTENT THAT PLANS ARE SEEN INCREASED UTILIZATION OR INCREASE COSTS. THAT IS ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE RATE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE ACCEPT IT -- AT FACE VALUE AND JUST SAY -- YOU KNOW YOU PAID YOU DECIDED TO PAY A PROVIDER US I MAKING THIS UP A THOUSAND DOLLARS A CONSULTATION -- AND SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO BUILD THAT INTO YOUR RATES AND THAT'S GOOD WHAT WE DO IS E HAVE A WAY IN WHICH WE LOOK AT THAT AND SAY. YOU KNOW FOR SIMILARLY SITUATED RATES AND OTHER AREAS ARE YOU PAYING YOUR PROVIDERS A THOUSAND DOLLARS A CONSULTATION ARE YOU PAYING THE FIVE HUNDRED YOU KNOW AND THEN WE LOOK AT THE OTHER PLAN IN WHICH YOU KNOW MOST OF OUR PLANS HAVE OTHER PLANS IN THE SAME SERVICE AREA. YOU'RE LOOKING AT WHAT THEIR COSTS ARE AND IF THERE COSTS ARE SIMILARLY SITUATED YOU'RE SAYING WELL THAT'S JUST WHAT THE MARKET. IS IF YOU ARE AN OUT LIAR AND YOU'RE PAYING A THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A CONSULTATION AND THE OTHER PLANS ARE PAYING TWO HUNDRED REPUBLICAN AND NUDGE THAT DOWN. BECAUSE YOU'RE CLEARLY DOING SOMETHING THAT IS NOT IN KEEPING WITH THAT. SO WE DO AVERAGING WITHIN THE PLAN AND WE DO AVERAGING FOR PLANS AGAINST EACH OTHER AND THEN WE HAVE OTHER TYPES AS LIKE IN IN PHARMACY WE HAVE -- PHARMACY EQUIVALENCY -- I'M NOT USING THE WORDS CORRECTLY BUT WE HAVE WAYS IN WHICH WE SAY IT LOOKS LIKE YOU SHOULD BE USING MORE GENERICS AND YOU'VE BEEN USING HIGHER BRANDS YOUR PHARMACY COSTS ARE NOT IN KEEPING WITH WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT THEM TO BE AND SO WE'RE GOING TO ADD. A FACTOR TO THAT TO KIND OF DRIVE IT DOWN INTO FORCE THE PLAN. TO TO MODIFY THAT SO THE RATE PROCESSES. FAR MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT MAKE IT SOUND BUT IT IT DOESN'T JUST SAY THAT WE TAKE THEIR COSTS AND THEN WE JUST BUILD INTO THE RATE THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH WE EITHER SMOOTHS THE DATA. TREND IT OR WE LOOK AT IT IN COMPARISON TO OTHER DATA THAT WE HAVE TO SEE IF IT'S APPROPRIATE. SO I GUESS THAT WITH THAT WITH THAT STARTED ME THINKING ABOUT IS THAT -- OBVIOUSLY THE FEE FOR SERVICE PORTION OF THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY AROUND. MEDI CAL IS SOMETHING THAT IS THAT IS SMALLER NOW THAN IT WAS IN AND GETTING SMALLER GETTING SMALLER SO KNOWING THAT WE NEED MORE PROVIDERS OUT THERE AND THERE MIGHT BE PEOPLE AND THAT FEE FOR SERVICE ENVIRONMENT THAT WOULD BE WILLING TO DO IT. BUT WE HAVEN'T RESTORED EVEN THE AND AND IN YET THAT THERE ARE PROVIDERS WITH THE MESSAGE THE MANAGED CARE SYSTEMS THAT ARE GETTING MORE MONEY IF I'M A FEE FOR SERVICE PROVIDER OUT THERE. AND I'M LIVING UNDER THE 10% CUTS THAT HAPPENED AND WE'RE IN A ROBUST ENVIRONMENT WHERE WE'VE GOT RESERVES. AND OTHER PROVIDERS ARE GETTING MORE AND AYE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SERVICE BUT I'M pERA. FEES WHY ARE WE NOT USING RESOURCE SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES. OR ARE WE RELY SOLELY ON PROPS FIFTY SIX TO HELP WITH THE PROVIDER INCREASES WHY. WOULD THOSE SHOULD BE ENHANCEMENTS ON TOP IN MY OPINION ENHANCEMENTS ON TOP OF THE RESTORATION OF THE RATES THAT WERE CUT. SO. WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE BIG TICKET ITEMS THAT WERE WE'RE LOOKING AT IN OUR BUDGET GOING FORWARD THIS IS NOT PARTICULARLY HUGE AND SOME OF THE BIG ONES? SO IS THE DEPARTMENT. OPEN TO THAT OR IS THIS IS THIS. OR FOR IS THAT FEE FOR SERVICE MODEL THAT'S THAT'S GRADUALLY DWINDLING. DESTINED TO NOT BE SUPPORTED AND AND GO AWAY ALL TOGETHER YEAH -- SO COUPLE THINGS -- SO WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO MAINTAIN A FEE FOR SERVICE SYSTEM IN THE STATE -- DUAL ELIGIBLES -- IT USE IT TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY'RE NOT ENROLLED IN MANAGED CARE -- UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS FOR LIMITED SCOPE SERVICES I'M WE HAVE CERTAIN POPULATIONS THAT ARE EXEMPT FROM MANAGED CARE FOSTER KIDS FOR EXAMPLE -- AND THEN INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID BUT ARE IN THE CHOICE PERIOD FOR MANAGED CARE'S PLAN SELECTION THERE IN ROLLED IN FEE FOR SERVICE WILL THEY MAKE THEIR PLAN CHOICE SO. WE WILL NEVER GET RID OF FEE FOR SERVICE IT WILL ALWAYS CONTINUE TO EXIST -- TO THE EXTENT THAT -- SO THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT PROPOSED -- AB NINETY SEVEN RESTORATION THE PHYSICIAN SIDE I THINK TO THE EXTENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND THE ADMINISTRATION THROUGH BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS WHICH OBVIOUSLY WILL PROBABLY. COMMENCE MORE -- AFTER THE MAY REVISION -- THAT WOULD BE A CHOICE BETWEEN THE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE AS TO WHETHER THAT WAS A PRIORITY. RESTORATION THAT THEY WANTED TO MAKE IN LIGHT OF OTHER YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANT. FISCAL CHOICES THAT THEY WOULD OTHERWISE WANT TO SPEAK TO HAVE THAT MANY USE. FOR I GUESS I JUST WONDER FOR GOING BACK TO YOU EXPAND COVERAGE FOR PEOPLE YES EXPECT THE FEE FOR SERVICE MODEL TO HAVE THE SAME RATES. I'M NOT SURE HOW WE'RE GOOD EVER GOING TO HAVE THE PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE WHAT WE NEED IF WE CAN'T ADEQUATELY REIMBURSED PEOPLE YES THAT'S THAT'S REALLY THE AND I THINK A LOT OF THE FEE FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS TO BE HONEST. SERVE BOTH WORLDS THEY'RE SERVING FEE FOR SERVICE AND THEY'RE ALSO CONTRACTED WITH WITH MANAGED CARE SO THEY'VE GOT THEY'VE GOT AREAS IN WHICH THERE STRADDLING BOTH DELIVERY SYSTEMS A LOT BUT NOT ALL. THAT'S TRUE. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOTHING HERE AFTER. A TIME -- LIKE TO WELCOME OUR NEXT PANEL -- OUR NEXT PANEL INCLUDES -- MICHAEL DAY THE DIRECTOR OF HEALTH POLICY FOR CHILDREN NOW AND ACTUALLY I WANT TO GIVE CREDIT TO CHILDREN NOW THEY WERE THE INSPIRATION FOR THIS AUDIT AND I THINK THEM THANK THEM FOR THAT -- DIMITRI MALLOY A IS A PLAN -- PROVIDER PERFORMANCE MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR ANTHEM CALIFORNIA MAP I MEDICAID. BOB FREEMAN THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER PERCENT CAL HEALTH. A LINDA WAY -- POLICY ADVOCATE FOR WESTERN CENTER -- ONLINE PARTY AND CASEY NAY GOAL DOCTOR CASING NICKEL POLICY AND ADVOCACY ADVISER FOR THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS IN CALIFORNIA SO -- IN THAT ORDER I GUESS MR DAY -- CAN HEAR ME. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS MICHAEL DAY DIRECTOR OF HEALTH POLICY CHILDREN NOW WHERE A STATEWIDE CHILDREN'S POLICY RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION FIRST THANKS TO THE CHAIRS MEMBERS AND STAFF OF THE COMMITTEES FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. WERE SPECIALLY GRATEFUL TO DR WHAT FOR HIS LEADERSHIP IN PURSUING ON IT LAST YEAR. I'D ALSO LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DILIGENT WORK OF THE AUDITOR AND HER STAFF AS WELL AS THE DCS AFTER THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE REPORT. UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE THE STATE HAS FAILED TO PROVIDE WHAT KIDS NEED. AS AUDITOR'S PRESENTATION SHOWED MILLIONS OF CHILDREN OF MEDI CAL MISS OUT ON IMPORTANT PREVENTIVE SERVICES EACH YEAR. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIS MISSING OUT OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES THAT INCLUDE. BASIC AGE APPROPRIATE WELL CHILD VISITS AND CHECKUPS AS WELL SPECIFIC SERVICES LIKE IMMUNIZATIONS THAT KEEP KIDS SAFE FROM COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. AND SCREENING SECOND HELP CATCHING ADDRESS CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS EARLY ON PREVENTIVE CARE FOR KIDS IS A FOUNDATIONAL PART OF THE FEDERAL MEDICAID BENEFIT PACKAGE THAT KIDS ARE ENTITLED TO UNDER. FEDERAL LAW IT'S CALLED THE EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT BENEFIT. THE EPS ET BENEFIT IS -- IS AN ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL PART OF THE SERVICES THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS AGREED TO DELIVER WHEN THEY SIGNED CONTRACTS WITH DH CS AND ACCEPTED ACTUAR THE SOUND PAYMENT RATES. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY PREVENTIVE CARE FOR KIDS IS A KEY PART OF WHAT KIDS NEED TO THRIVE THROUGHOUT CHILDHOOD AND GROW UP TO BE HEALTHY ADULTS. I'M HEALTHY ADULTS ARE NOT A SURPRISE WE CREATE THEM EVERY DAY WHEN WE FAIL TO DELIVER PREVENTIVE CARE FOR KIDS. IT'S UNCONSCIONABLE TO LET CHILDREN CONTINUE TO BEAR THE COST. OF THE SYSTEMIC FAILURES OF THE MEDICAL PROGRAM THEY'RE HAPPENING AT EVERY LEVEL. KIDS MUST BE MADE A PRIORITY MEDI CAL BECAUSE PREVENTIVE CARE SO IMPORTANT AND HAS LASTING IMPACTS INTO THEIR ADULTHOOD. BACK IN TWENTY THIRTEEN CHILDREN NOW IN OUR PARTNERS AT THE FIRST FIVE ASSOCIATION FIRST START ENQUIRING ABOUT MEDI CAL DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENING RATES IN EARNEST WE DIDN'T THINK BACK THEN THAT IT WOULD BE SUCH A LONG AND TROUBLING WROTE. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THIS LEGISLATURE UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED A RESOLUTION BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE. THAT'S A CLEAR CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS REFERRAL AND EARLY INTERVENTION AS A PRIORITY FOR THE STATE. AND YET AS A PROGRAM MEDICAL WAS NOT RESPONSIVE AND WAS IN FACT UNDER DELIVERING ON THE SCREEN EVEN THOUGH POLICY DICTATED THAT SCREENING SHOULD BE HAPPENING. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE EXTERNAL QUALITY REVIEW ORGANIZATION EACH EURO RECOMMENDED DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENS BE ADDED AS A MEDICAL QUALITY MEASURE BUT THE STATE AGAIN DID NOT TAKE ACTION. THE STATE HAS A DUTY TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN RECEIVE THE PREVENTIVE CARE THAT THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THE EPS THE TEAM TITLE IS MORE THAN A REQUIREMENT TO COVER AND PAY FOR SERVICES. BUT RATHER AN AFFIRMATIVE RESPONSIBILITY TO PROMOTE EDUCATE AND SURE CHILDREN ARE RECEIVING THOSE SERVICES. SO FIRST MEASUREMENT IT'S COMMONLY UNDERSTOOD THAT WHAT GETS MEASURED MATTERS AND IN FACT AUDITOR'S INVESTIGATION SHOWS THAT UTILIZATION RATES WERE HIGHER FOR SERVICES WERE THERE. WHERE WHERE THERE WERE PERFORMANCE MEASURES -- RATHER THAN FOR SERVICES THAT THEY WERE NOT. SO THE STATE MUST SEND A SIGNAL ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF YOU PST PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR KIDS BY ROUTINELY AND ROBUSTLY TRACKING IT ALONG THE WAY. DATE ON PREVENTIVE CARE FOR KIDS IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING IN ADDRESSING HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT WE KNOW EXISTING SERVICE DELIVERY AND THAT COULD BE EXACERBATED WITHOUT. CONCERTED INTENTIONAL EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THEM. RELATED TO MEASUREMENT IS ACCOUNTABILITY. THE STEPS TO TEACH YES HAS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED AROUND THE QUALITY MEASURES AND ACCOUNTABILITY PROCESS ARE AN EXCELLENT FIRST STEP TO AMELIORATE SOME OF THE LONGSTANDING DEFICIENCIES AND DATA AND OVERSIGHT. THE STEPS ARE CLEARLY A PART OF GOVERNOR NUISANCE PARTY FOCUS ON EARLY CHILDHOOD AND ARE SUPPORTED BY THE PROPOSED BUDGET INVESTMENT IN MEDICAL PROVIDER RATES. HOWEVER THESE EFFORTS WELL SIGNIFICANT ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO INCREASE CHILDREN'S RECEIPT OF PREVENTIVE SERVICES. AS NOTED IN READING YESTERDAY BY THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION. MEDICAL MANAGED CARE OVERSIGHT SHOULD MOVE BEYOND COMPLIANCE INTO EXCELLENCE AROUND CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT CARE. IN ADDITION TO ESTABLISHING A QUALITY STRATEGY OR GENDER FOR KIDS. THE STATE COULD BETTER CLARIFYING GUIDANCE IN CONTRACT THE SPECIFIC EPS D. T. REQUIREMENTS THAT HEALTH PLANS ARE DELEGATED TO PROVIDE. AND TIE THEM TO SPECIFIC QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS. NOTABLY THE STATE HAS AN UPCOMING OPPORTUNITY TO MORE STRONGLY OUTLINED THE EPS D. T. -- ENTIRELY SPECIFICATIONS IN CONTRACTS AS MEDICAL IS INITIATING THE RIVER FROM A PROCESS TO TAKE PLACE NEXT YEAR. AND FINALLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT OUR REGION EDUCATION. SO AS WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE TO CLEARLY COMMUNICATE TO FAMILIES AND PROVIDERS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF AND RULES AROUND PREVENTIVE CARE AND IT NEEDS TO BE DONE BY BOTH THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERICES AND BY HEALTH PLANS. SO ASSUMING THAT PROVIDER NETWORKS ARE ADEQUATE AND THEY'RE NOT UNREASONABLE TRAVEL TIMES ARE DISTANCES. AND IF PROVIDER DIRECTORIES ARE UPDATED ENOUGH WHERE A PARENT CAN EASILY IDENTIFY NEARBY PROVIDER THAT WILL MEET THEIR CHILD'S NEEDS. AND IF THAT PARENT AND THEN SECURE AN APPOINTMENT AN INTERPRETER THING NEED IT WITHIN THE REQUIRED TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS. AND THEN WHEN THAT PARENT USES THEIR RESOURCES OF TIME IN TRANSPORTATION TO SHOW UP AT THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE WITH THEIR CHILD WHAT HAPPENS. THIS IS WHERE THE STATE MUST PROVIDE A VERY CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXPECTATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AROUND PREVENTIVE CARE FOR KIDS. MORE MUST BE DONE TO COMMUNICATE PROACTIVELY CLEARLY AND CONSISTENTLY WITH FAMILIES ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN WHO ARE KNOWN BY THEIR PLANS BY THEIR DOCTORS BY THE DEPARTMENT. TO HAVE MISSED OUT ON PREVENTIVE SERVICES IN THE PAST. AGAIN THIS HAS TO BE A FOUGHT FOR IN PROACTIVE EFFORT NOT AN AFTERTHOUGHT TO CHECK BOX. SO MORE THAN JUST LEARNING FROM THE EXPERIENCE INTENT TO CAL WE FULLY EXPECT T. H. U. S. T. ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS AND EXPERTS EARLY AND OFTEN TO MAKE A BENEFICIARY OUTREACH CAMPAIGN FOCUSED ON IMPROVING PREVENTIVE CARE FOR KIDS. AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE. MILLIONS OF CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA ARE RELYING ON MEDICAL AND WE MUST GET THIS RIGHT. THE AUDITOR'S REPORT OFFERS VALUABLE BLUEPRINT TO ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTAL STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS WITH THAT BECAUSE DELIVERY OF PREVENTIVE CARE FOR CHILDREN. AND WE BELIEVE THE AUDIT FINDINGS WEREN'T ONGOING ATTENTION AND FOLLOW UP AND AS SUCH RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT THESE COMMITTEES -- WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT WE APPRECIATE THE DIRECTORS WILLINGNESS TO DO SO. AND MONITOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND SO JUST -- SUGGESTION IT WOULD BE MAYBE A HEARING FROM NOW TO KIND OF SEE WHERE WE ARE I HEAR YOU'RE FROM NOW TO SEE WHERE WE ARE -- SO WITH THAT SAID -- CHILDREN NOW IS LOOKING FOR TO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT WITH THE LEGISLATURE HEALTH PLANS AND PEDIATRICIANS MEMBERS OF THE MEDICAL CHILDREN'S HEALTH ADVISORY PANEL AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. TO MAKE CHILDREN A PRIORITY IN MEDI CAL AND TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR KIDS THANK YOU. p[inaudible] DR. AT THANK LEASE THANK YOU. THANKS TO THE COMMITTEE. FOR HAVING THIS HEARING AND HEARING US OUT -- I I THINK MY AREA THAT I WANTED TO SPEAK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFICALLY WAS -- A BIT ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT FOLLOWED WITH ADDING THE METRICS AND TO THE TIMELINE EVEN SOME OF THE THINGS THAT MAYBE DOCTOR CAN TOUCHED ON A BIT ON ADDINGTO HAVING THE HEALTH PLANS. I'M BE RESPONSIBLE SORRY LET ME BACK UP AND INTRODUCED MYSELF FOR SECOND. I'M DR TO MEET YOUR MALLOY -- I'M UP PROVIDER -- PLAN ACCOUNTABILITY MEDICAL DIRECTOR -- FOR ANTHEM BLUE CROSS AND BEEN WITH ANTHEM SAID ABOUT TWENTY FIFTEEN AND ALSO WORK WITH MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. PRIOR TO THAT I AM AN INTERNAL MEDICINE DOCTOR. I'M RAISING CALIFORNIA'S A VERY TIED TO THE SYSTEM AND HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH A LITTLE POPULATION SINCE IT'S ALL OF MY CLINICAL TRAINING -- I THINK YOU KNOW I WANT TO STATE START BY SAYING THAT ANTHEM BLUE CROSS IS NOT TAKING THE STANCE AT ALL OF AT HAVING ANY SORT OF PUSH BACK ON THE ADDITIONAL METRICS THAT WERE RECOMMENDED. THE THINGS THAT SHOULD THAT WERE STATED THAT SHOULD BE MEASURED WE ALSO WE AGREE THAT WHEN IT'S MEASURED. IS WHEN PEOPLE TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO IT AND MATTER IS IT DOESN'T DIRECTLY AFFECT YOU IS ATION OF SERVICES -- TO THAT END I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE ACTUALLY IN A UNIQUE POSITION BECAUSE WE HAD BEEN ON A CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN WITH THE STATE MORE RECENTLY AROUND QUALITY AND ACTUALLY GREATLY INCREASED OUR QUALITY PERFORMANCE OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS -- FROM ONE LEVEL TO A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LEVEL AND SO SORT OF YOU ARE UNIQUELY ABLE TO SPEAK TO WHAT IT MIGHT TAKE IN ORDER TO GET. TO THOSE NEW LEVELS ADDING NEW METRICS ADDING SCOPE. I'M WITH THOSE MEASUREMENTS -- AND FOR US I THINK THAT WHAT I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO A BIT IS NOT ANY ANY CHALLENGE AT ALL ON THE METRICS THAT WOULD NEED TO BE ADDED I THINK. YOU KNOW BALANCING OUT AND THE CARE FOR CHILDREN IN AND ADDING IT TO THE THE CARE THE METRIC THAT WE'VE WE'VE PUT IN FOR THE COMPLEX ADULT. POPULATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO MANAGED CARE IS A COMPLETELY FAIR AND APPROPRIATE THING TO DO THE ISSUE IS REALLY SOMEWHAT ON THE TIME LINE OF EXECUTION TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS -- AS A WORKING WITH THE STATE IN THE STATE IS WORKING WITH THE HEALTH PLANS IN ORDER TO AT TO EXECUTE ON THAT -- THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE ARE SOME LESSONS LEARNED FROM OUR ACTUAL -- RECENTS -- WORK WITH OUR CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN TO THE TO RAISE OUR QUALITY TO A NEW LEVEL WITH OUR HEALTH PLAN SOME OF THE KEY THINGS I THINK THAT WE FOUND WERE. THAT -- THERE'S AN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL THAT'S NEEDED WHEN YOU HAVEN'T BEEN MEASURING SOMETHING YOU NEED TO APPROPRIATELY MEASURE IT. NEED TO EDUCATE YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE PULLING PULLING THAT DATE OUT OF MEDICAL CHART REPORTING IT APPROPRIATELY TO THE STATE SO IT'S ACTUALLY BEING CAPTURED BEING MEASURED SO THAT THE GAPS ARE ACTUALLY IDENTIFIED APPROPRIATELY -- AS WELL AND THAT THIS SOME OF THESE THINGS REQUIRE PERTAIN TO THE PROVIDER BEHAVIOR CHANGES IN IN IN TECHNICAL SPECS -- OUR ANALYSTS SEEM TO TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN PULL FOR MYANMAR'S ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS WHAT YOU'VE PUT TEMPLE FOR MEDICAL CHART AND JUST SIMPLY BUILDING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE IN. WE'VE DONE IT ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE THAT THAT DATA GETS REPORTED IN FOR THE EXISTING METRICS AND WHAT OF OBVIOUSLY DO IT FOR THE NEW METRICS. WE'VE ALSO DONE IT ON THE THE PERSON SIDE SO WE'VE BUILT IN THINGS LIKE PRACTICE PRACTICE CONSULTANTS. TO ACTUALLY GO INTO THE OFFICES LET POSITIONS NO AND THEIR OFFICE STAFF KNOW HOW IT IS TO TO CODE SOMETHING TO COUNT SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE CARE THAT THEY'RE GIVING IS ACTUALLY BEING CAPTURED AND REPORTED APPROPRIATELY THOSE THINGS JUST TAKE A BIT OF TIME THEY TAKE RELATIONSHIP BUILDING THEY TAKE EDUCATION THE TICKET OPTIONS IN PROVIDER BEHAVIOR -- THE OTHER THING IS THAT WE'VE ALSO USE INCENTIVES AND SO YOU KNOW JUST SPEAKING TO THE FACT OF HOW THE STATE IS LOOKING AT USING PAY FOR PERFORMANCE -- IS WHY WE CARRY VERSUS SANCTIONS AND THE STEAK AND HOW FAST THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO ENACT THOSE AND AND AND TO HAVE A PROPER BALANCE SO THAT THERE'S SOME. EFFECTIVENESS WITH ACTUALLY BUILDING IN PROGRAMMING -- AND NOT DISINCENTIVE ISING HERE THAT THAT YOU THAT YOU WANT SO WE HAVE. RECENT -- EXPERIENCE WITH THAT -- AND IN ADDITION I THINK THE LAST THING IS JUST MAKING SURE THAT THERE ARE SOME BUILDING IN OF SOME PROGRESS AND INTERIM PROCESS POINTS RIGHT SO THERE'S AN OVERALL OUTCOME OF COURSE THAT YOU WANT. OF A QUALITY LEVEL OF THAT YOU'RE REACHED ACROSS THE STATE FOR ALL FOR ALL CHILDREN BENEFICIARIES BUT OF COURSE THERE ARE. THERE ARE POINTS IN BETWEEN THAT YOU THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY HIT AS WELL TO SHOW THAT YOU'RE MAKING SOME PROGRESS TO WEAR THAT OVERALL OUTCOME. AND US HAVING ACTUALLY DONE THAT AND IN IN OUR INTERACTION WITH THE CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN WE WE TOOK. OUR QUALITY LEVEL FROM THE YOU KNOW HITTING A 54% LEVEL TO A PERFORMANCE LEVEL WITHIN A FEW YEARS BUT INCREMENTALLY YOU COULD SEE OVER EACH YEAR WE REPORTED IN HOW THE IMPROVED OVER TIME -- AND HOW THAT REFLECTED THEN THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL THAT I WAS TO DISCUSS. SO I THINK THAT OF BUILDING IN SOME OF THOSE THINGS WOULD ALSO LEAD TO A REALLY HELPFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PLAN ACTUALLY EXECUTING WHAT IS THE STATE IS IS PUTTING IN -- AT THIS POINT -- I DO HAVE A FEW EXAMPLES OF SORT OF OTHER THINGS THAT WE LEARNED -- TO WHILE WE WERE DOING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE BUILT -- THAT ARE MORE CONCRETE EXAMPLES SUCH AS CLINIC DAYS THOSE THOSE -- ENTITLED SOME PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR BETTER QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS -- AND WE WENT FROM HAVING YOU KNOW A FEW A YEAR AND THAT VERY FIRST YEAR -- THAT WE WERE IMPLEMENTING INTO LAST YEAR HAVING YOU KNOW OVER FIFTY AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT PARTNERSHIPS WITH A LOT OF FQHCS IN ORDER TO AGAINST -- INCREASE THE SCARE AND AND THE SCOPE AS WELL AND AGAIN THOSE ARE JUST THINGS THAT DEVELOP OVER TIME BUT ONCE YOU STARTED AND YOU GET A GOOD TEMPLATE YOU CAN ACTUALLY SCALE IT AND ACTUALLY HAVE MUCH MORE IMPACT. IN ADDITION I TALKED ABOUT OUR PRACTICE CONSULTANTS WE STARTED OUT WITH A FEW WE HAVE MANY MORE OVER THE STATE AS WELL THAT ARE WALKING PRACTICES THROUGH EXACTLY HOW TO REACH THESE METRICS HAD ACCOUNT FOR THEM AND HOW TO DELIVER THAT HERE. ON ALL KINDS OF EDUCATION POINTS AND THEN ACTUALLY BECAUSE WE GOT TO PUT THOSE TOGETHER OVER TIME WE SAW A SYNERGISTIC EFFECT. BECAUSE WE BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND ACTUALLY ENACTED EFFECTIVE PROGRAMMING IN THOSE AREAS -- WE SAW PEOPLE ASKING US TO THEN PARTNER ASKING US TO DO IN A INNOVATIVE PROGRAM THAT ALSO THEN -- GAVE A BOOST TO THE OVERALL QUALITY PERFORMANCE THAT WE HAD -- ACROSS THE WHOLE NETWORK AND SO IT JUST THINK -- HAVING AN IN AN INTIMATE UNDERSTANDING OF THOSE NEEDS AND HAVING ACTED THEM JUST RECENTLY -- AND SHOWN REALLY GREAT OUTCOMES JUST USING SOME OF THOSE LESSONS LEARNED TO SAY HOW WE WOULD ACTUALLY ALSO APPLY THOSE TO THE NEW METRICS THAT ARE FAIRLY COMING IN -- AND BEING INTRODUCED -- TO BALANCE OUT AS WELL -- WHAT WE'RE MEASURING FOR CHILDREN ACROSS THE NETWORK? RIGHT THANK YOU. GOOD. AFTERNOON I'M MY NAME'S BOB FREEMAN I AM CEO OF SAN CAL HEALTH WE ARE THE COUNTY ORGANIZE HEALTH SYSTEM. THAT SERVES SANTA BARBARA AND SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTIES AND WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS. SO I'M HERE TODAY NOT ONLY ON BEHALF OF SOME CALVET ALSO THE LOCAL HEALTH PLANS A CALIFORNIA WHICH IS THE ASSOCIATION OF THE SIXTEEN PUBLICLY SPONSORED HEALTH PLANS. THAT -- CIRCA MEDI CAL POPULATION. AND WHEN THIS REPORT CAME OUT I THINK I SPEAK SPEAK FOR THE OUR ENTIRE ASSOCIATION WITH SO WE ALL. A REDDIT CLOSELY AND TOOK THE CONCLUSIONS SERIOUSLY. OBVIOUSLY -- SOME AREAS -- WE DID FAIRLY WELL SOME AREAS WE DIDN'T AND AND THIS IS A GOOD SNAPSHOT FOR US -- TO TO SEE EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT TIME. AND I THINK. ALL THE PLANS OF A LOCAL PLANTS HAVE ALL ACTION ACTUALLY UNDERTAKEN REVIEW OF OKAY WHAT ARE WE DOING WELL WHAT ARE WE DOING NOT WHAT. TO START MY SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO START IMPROVING ON AND SOME OF THE AREAS WHERE WE DIDN'T WE DIDN'T SCORE SO WELL. AND I THINK WERE -- VERY -- WILLING AND ANXIOUS TO WORK WITH -- DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES LEGISLATURE OF PEOPLE THIS PANEL -- TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIGURE OUT WHAT EXACTLY ONE ACCOMPLISH AND HOW BEST TO ACCOMPLISH IT AND WHILE A DOCTOR WHILE I WAS TALKING ABOUT KIND OF THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND I ALWAYS HAS BEEN TOUCHED UPON BUT I A LOT OF DISCUSSION TODAY'S ALSO BEEN ON THE ACCESS TO PROVIDERS IN DIFFERENT AREAS. AND I THINK IN OUR SIXTEEN HEALTH PLANS THERE IS A VAST DIFFERENCE IN THE CHALLENGES WE MAY FACE ABOUT BUILDING AND MAINTAINING PROVIDER NETWORKS -- THE CHALLENGES THAT. WE MAY HAVE IN SANTA BARBARA SAN LUIS OBISPO ARE NOT THE SAME THAT WOULD BE -- IN MOST URBAN AREAS. AND I THINK THIS IS BEN -- ALSO TOUCHED UPON. FIRST FOR OUR EXAMPLE OUR SERVICE AREA WE HAVE A HANDFUL OF SMALL CITIES AND GREAT DISTANCES BETWEEN THEM. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF OUR RURAL AREAS SO ARE CHALLENGES WITH THE PROVIDER NETWORK REALLY REVOLVE AROUND THE LACK OF PROVIDERS NOT WHETHER THEIR CONTRACTOR NOT WE ACTUALLY CONTRACT WITH THE VAST MAJORITY OF ALL LICENSED PHYSICIANS IN OUR SERVICE AREA. BUT EVEN GIVEN THAT WE STILL HAVE TO SUBMIT SIXTY SEVEN OF THE ALTERNATE ACCESS -- STANDARDS. AND THEY WERE ALL DUE TO EITHER A SIMPLE LACK OF PROVIDERS HAVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES -- PEDIATRIC ENDOCRINOLOGY PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY THERE AREN'T ANY OF THOSE AND SO MOST BASEBALL COUNTY SO THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO TO SANTA BARBARA COUNTY. OR PERHAPS MEMBERS THAT LIVE IN REMOTE AREAS OR NO THERE ARE NO POSITIONS OR FACILITIES HOSPITALS NEARBY. WHEN WE DO RUN INTO? ISSUES WITH PROVIDERS -- ESPECIALLY -- THAT. THEIR SKILLS ARE IN HIGH DEMAND WE HAVE NEGOTIATED HIGHER RATES -- AS NEEDED -- TO YOU KNOW RESPONSE TO THE MARKET AND WE'VE BEEN OTHERWISE IT'S CREATIVE AND FLEXIBLE AS WE CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE HAVE IS FOR COMPREHENSIVE A PROVIDER NETWORK IS LOCALLY AS POSSIBLE -- AGAIN IN. IN OUR SIXTY SEVEN CASES -- THERE WAS JUST THERE IS JUST NO NONE OF THESE PROVIDERS IN THE AREA. AND MY EXPECTATION IS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TO CENTER VALLEY TALK ABOUT NORTH OF SACRAMENTO THOSE ARE THE AREAS -- AND SO I THINK IF WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS. TO THAT WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT IF YOU -- TO TIGHTEN IT -- OF THE ACCESS STANDARDS THAT MAY NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON AREAS WHERE IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT A MATTER OF REFUSAL -- INABILITY TO CONTRACT IT'S THE ISSUES THERE'S NO ONE TO CONTRACT WITH. AND I IT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND OTHER AREAS HAVE THE MORE DENSITY OF PROVIDERS -- BUT MAY PERHAPS A LACK OF PROVIDERS WILLING ACCEPT MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT. COMPETITIONS BY OTHER PLANS FOR THEIR SERVICES AND POSITIONS VERY HELPFUL PRACTICES SO. I THINK MOBILE OUR POINT ON THIS IS THERE I DON'T THINK THEY'LL BE ONE EASY OR SIMPLE. OR SINGLE SOLUTION TO THIS I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A COMBINATION OF HOW DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE -- NEED TO BE ADDRESSED TO HELP BRING THESE -- DOUBLES UP SO WITH THAT I THANK YOU. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY FIRSTLY WOULD LIKE TO THINK THE CO CHAIRS. FOR HAVING THIS HEARING AS WELL AS THE INVITATION TO SPEAK. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZES THAT CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS ARE NOT LITTLE ADULTS AND THUS THE EARLY AND PERIODIC SCREENING DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT EPS TT BENEFIT. FOR MEDI CAL ENROLLEES UNDER AGE TWENTY ONE IS MORE ROBUST THAN ADULTS. THE PST T. IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE CHILDREN GET THE HEALTHCARE THEY NEED WHEN THEY NEED IT SOTHAT HEALTH PROBLEMS OUR VERDICT OR DIAGNOSED AND TREATED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. PREVENTING AND TREATING POTENTIAL ILLNESSES AND CONDITIONS EARLY CAN HELP CHILDREN GROW INTO HEALTHY ADULTS WHO NEED FEWER MEDICAL SERVICES LATER IN THEIR LIVES. ACCESS ISSUES TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING ISSUE PARTICULARLY FOR DENTAL PREVENTIVE SERVICES AS SEEN BY UTILIZATION DATA BEING LESS THAN 50% FOR MEDI CAL CHILDREN IN NOVEMBER. TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY FOURTEEN AUDIT FOUND SIMILAR DENTAL UTILIZATION WHICH RESULTED IN INCREASED FUNDING TO THE DENTAL TRANSFORMATION. INITIATIVE PROP FIFTY SIX RATE INCREASES AND STREAMLINE PROVIDER ENROLLMENT. IN ADDITION AN ANALYSIS OF DH CS BILLING DATA FOUND THAT BETWEEN TWENTY TWELVE AND TWENTY SIXTEEN APPROXIMATELY THREE QUARTERS. OF THE STATE'S TWELVE AND TWENTY FUND TWENTY FOUR MONTH OLD CHURCH. CHILDREN ON MEDI CAL DID NOT RECEIVE BLOOD LEAD SCREENING DESPITE FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS MANDATING BLOOD LEAD SCREENINGS FOR THESE CHILDREN. THEREFORE THE AUDITOR'S FINDINGS IS NOT A SURPRISE TO FAMILIES ARE ADVOCATES. WE AGREE WITH THE AUDITOR'S FINDING THE DH CS DELEGATES RESPONSIBILITY TO MEDI CAL PLANTS BUT FAILS TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE GUIDANCE AND OVERSIGHT SO RECOMMENDS. DH CS PROVIDED MORE AFFIRMATIVE GUIDANCE. DH CS IS IN THE PROCESS OF REVISING ITS THE PST T. ALL PLAN LETTER. AND ONE REQUEST FROM HEALTH PLANS IS FOR DCF TO PROVIDE THE INTERVAL FREQUENCY FOR SCREENING VISION DENTAL AND HEARING SERVICES. THIS INDICATES THE CLEAR NEED FOR GREATER GUIDANCE SO RECOMMEND THE ALL PLAN LETTER CONTRACT AND IN ROWLEY HANDBOOK INCLUDE MORE SPECIFICITY ON E. P. STT. WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE DH CS REQUIRE MEDI CAL PLANS TO DO MORE AFFIRMATIVE OUT REACH TO INFORM IN ROWLEY'S ABOUT BPD. E. P. S. T. T. RIGHTS AND NECESSARY SCREENING AND PREVENTATIVE SERVICES WHICH IS WRITTEN INTO THE HEALTH PLAN CONTRACT IN MANY OTHER STATES. IN ADDITION DCS NEEDS TO MAKE CLEAR TO THE PLANS THAT THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING ALL CARE FOR THEIR CHILD ENROLLEES. EVEN WHEN THEY NEED SERVICES THAT ARE CARVED OUT LIKE DENTAL AND SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH. TOO OFTEN THE PLANS HAVE FAILED TO EFFECTIVELY COORDINATE ARVED OUT SERVICES FOR CHILDREN LEAVING GAPING HOLES IN THEIR CARE. ALTHOUGH 90% OF MEDI CAL CHILDREN ARE IN MANAGED CARE WE WOULD NOTE THE LOWER UTILIZATION RATE FOR THOSE REMAINING IN FEE FOR SERVICE. AT LESS THAN 37% AND URGE DH CS TO ADDRESS THIS AS WELL AS THROUGH CARE COORDINATION GROUP OR OTHER EFFORT. WE RECOGNIZE THE HEAVY LEFT TO IMPLEMENT THE TWENTY SIXTEEN FEDERAL MANAGE CARE RULES AND THE DEPARTMENT'S FOCUS ON COMPLYING WITH THESE RULES INCLUDING REVIEWING OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND ALTERNATIVE ACCESS STANDARDS AND ULTIMATELY APPROVING TEN THOUSAND OF THE STANDARD. OF THESE REQUEST FOR CONTRACTED PROVIDERS WHO ARE LOCATED BEYOND THE TIME AND DISTANCE STANDARD STEP SET IN STATUTE. SUFFICIENT TIME HAS PASSED AND DH CS IS FOCUS SHOULD NOW BE ON ENSURING MEDI CAL ENROLLEES ARE RECEIVING THE QUALITY SERVICES THEY'RE ENTITLED TO YOU IN A TIMELY MANNER. WE APPRECIATE DR WOODS AB SIXTEEN FORTY TWO IN RESPONSE TO THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION WHICH WOULD ASSIST MEMBERS. WITH FINDING AND OUT OF NETWORK PROVIDER WHO MEETS REASONABLE TIME AND DISTANCE STANDARDS IN ADDITION WE RECOMMEND. THE DEPARTMENT REQUIRE PLANS TO INFORM ENROLLEES OF THEIR RIGHT OF THIS RIGHT AND TIMELY ACCESS STANDARDS WE APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORT AROUND QUALITY INCLUDING INCREASING THE MINIMUM PERFORMANCE LEVEL FROM. TWENTY FIVE TO FIFTY IF PERCENTILE NATIONAL MEDICAID AND THE NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE MEASURES BUT ALSO RECOMMEND DH CS REQUIRED PLANS TO COLLECT AND REPORT DEMOGRAPHIC DATA TO BE MEASURED AGAINST. IN ORDER TO REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES. THE AUDITOR'S REPORT FOUND GENERAL PREVENTIVE UTILIZATION RATES RANGE BASED ON LANGUAGE AND RACE ETHNICITY HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED FOR GREATER DATA SPECIFY THE CITY ON ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL PREVENTIVE SERVICES AND APPROPRIATE FOLLOW UP CARE. MEDI CAL IS A STATE WIDE PROGRAM AND CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES SHOULD NOT DEPEND ON PLAN REGION OR OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC. FACTORS BUT UNFORTUNATELY BASED ON ON EVEN PLAN AND GEOGRAPHIC PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS LACK OF OVERSIGHT AND GUIDANCE IT DOES. WE PROVIDE IT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT SEEK TO ADDRESS THIS AND INCREASED PREVENTIVE UTILIZATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU PLEASE PROCEED GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS DOCTOR CASEY NAGEL I'M A PHYSICIAN AND A PEDIATRICS INTERNAL MEDICINE RESIDENT AT UCLA. TODAY I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING OVER FIVE THOUSAND PEDIATRICIANS STATEWIDE. OUR MISSION IS TO PROMOTE THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF ALL INFANTS CHILDREN. ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CO CHAIRS THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR HOLDING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. THANK YOU ALSO TO THE AUDITORS AND STAFF FOR THEIR CRITICALLY IMPORTANT WORK. CALIFORNIA STANDING NEAR THE BOTTOM AND FORTY S. IN THE COUNTRY AND PROVISION OF PREVENTIVE CARE SERVICES TO A POPULATION THAT COMPRISES OVER HALF THE CHILDREN THE STATE. WHICH IS FLATLY UNACCEPTABLE. PREVENTIVE CARE INCLUDING WELL CHILD VISITS SCREENINGS LIKE THOSE THAT CAN PREVENT THE TERRIBLE SIDE EFFECTS OF LEAD POISONING IN CHILDREN AN INMATE IMMUNIZATIONS ARE THE CORNERSTONE OF GOOD HEALTH FOR DEVELOPING CHILDREN AND YOUTH. WE LOOK FOR TO PARTNERING WITH THE STATE THE PLANS THE FAMILIES AND CHILDREN AND OTHER PROVIDERS UNDER THE GUIDANCE N OVERSIGHT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND DH CS. TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES TWO X. ACCESS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE AUDIT REPORT. WE'VE HEARD TODAY THAT THERE ARE MANY CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO CALIFORNIA'S CLEAR NEED TO IMPROVE ITS PROVISION OF PREVENTIVE CARE SERVICES TO CHILDREN ENROLLED IN MEDICARE. PERSONS EXPERIENCE THESE CHALLENGES EVERY DAY AS WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE THAT CARE THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE GROWING HEALTH OF THIS GREAT STE. STATE'S POPULATION WE AGREE THAT A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH IS NEEDED THEREFORE WE ENDORSE AND STRONGLY SUPPORT THE STATEMENT MADE MY CHILDREN NOW. INCREASED AND MORE TRANSPARENT DATA COLLECTION MONITORING ENFORCEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OUTREACH AND EDUCATION AS WELL AS ENHANCE CARE COORDINATION IN THE FORM OF STANDARDIZED CLINICAL CARE MEASURES. AND SUPPORT SERVICES ARE ALL ESSENTIAL TO CLOSING CARE GAPS THAT ARE EXTREMELY COSTLY TO THE STATE AND DETRIMENTAL AND EVEN DEVASTATING TO FAMILIES. AS OPPORTUNITIES FOR PREVENTION EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT ARE MISSED WONDERFUL RARE FACTORS MUST BE ADDRESSED I WILL FOCUS BRIEFLY ON THE LACK OF ADEQUATE NUMBERS OF PHYSICIANS CARING FOR MEDI CAL CHILDREN IN BOTH URBAN AND RURAL. AREAS IN THE STATE NOT ONLY BECAUSE THAT'S MY AREA OF EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE AND THAT OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS. BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT IS CALLED OUT IN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT LOUDLY AND REPEATEDLY. USING TERMS SUCH AS THE KEY REASON AND MAJOR COST OF CALIFORNIA'S DISMAL STANDING IN PROVIDING PREVENTIVE CARE SERVICES TO CHILDREN UNDER MEDI CAL. THE REPORT HIGHLIGHTS NOTABLE DEFICIENCIES IN BOTH THE NUMBER AND LOCATION OF PROVIDERS. FORTUNATELY A MAJOR SOLUTION PROVIDED IN AUDITOR'S REPORT TO POOR PHYSICIAN AVAILABILITY IN MEDI CAL IS NOT COMPLICATED IT IS CLEAR. BY THE AUDITOR'S REPORT THE ONLY POLICY TOOL ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN PROVIDERS ACCEPTING MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES AS MEDICAID PAYMENT RATES. AS STATE MEDICAID RATES INCREASED THE PERCENTAGE OF PHYSICIANS ACCEPTING MEDICAID PATIENTS INCREASE. PAYMENT RATES WERE THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT FACTOR THAT HAD AN IMPACT ON PROVIDE A WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT NEW MEDICAID PATIENTS. ME AND SEVERAL OF MY CLOSE COLLEAGUES GREATLY ENJOYED CARING FOR THESE PATIENTS BECAUSE WE CAN MAKE A TRUE AND LASTING DIFFERENCE IN THESE PEOPLE WHO HAVE -- ESSENTIALLY VERY LOW HEALTH LITERACIES BUT SOMETIMES AND BASED ON MEDICAL SCHOOL DATA AND MYRIAD OF OTHER FACTORS WERE UNABLE. TO GOING TO A PRACTICE THAT -- PROVIDES CARE ONLY FOR THEM. SO AND THEN ALSO A COMPOUNDING FACTOR IS THE LACK OF INCOHERENCE TO ACCEPTABLE TIME AND DISTANCE STANDARDS AS EXHIBITED BY THE OVER AND EIGHTY THOUSAND EXCEPTION REQUEST SUBMITTED BY MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS. WHICH WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY DH CS APPROVED OVER TEN THOUSAND OF THOSE IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN IN SOME CASES RESULTING IN FAMILIES NEEDING TO TRAVEL MANY HOURS. AND HUNDREDS OF MILESIN ORDER TO SEE AN IN NETWORK PHYSICIAN IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT MANY DID NOT FOLLOW THROUGH EVEN WHEN THEY WERE ABLE TO GET AN APPOINTMENT. WHETHER IT WAS A GENERAL WELL CHILD CHECK WERE SUBSTANTIAL SUBSPECIALTY APPOINTMENT. THIS ACCESS ISSUE IN LIGHT OF THE RESURGENCE OF MEASLES AS WELL A DEADLY VACCINE PREVENTABLE DISEASE -- SHOWS JUST -- A LARGE PROBLEM WITH THE ACCESS THAT WE'RE FACING SO THE PICTURE PAINTED OF LACK OF ACCESS TO THE MOST BASIC IMPORTANT HERE. IS NOT WHEN ANY OF US WOULD WANT TO ENTER FOR ANY PERSON'S CHILD NIECE NEPHEW OR GRAND CHILD. THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PDF OF PEDIATRICS CALIFORNIA STRONGLY URGES THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS. IN OUR PREVENTIVE CARE NUMBERS BY SUPPORTING DH CS AND THE PLANS TO ALLOCATION OF STABLE FUNDS. INCLUDING THE ONES -- FOR LOAN REIMBURSEMENT WHICH WOULD ENCOURAGE YOUNG PHYSICIANS TO CARE FOR THESE PATIENTS EXCLUSIVELY AND WHILE THEN SUPPORTING THEM AFTER THEY'VE PAID OFF THEIR LOANS. WHICH WOULD HELP TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE PROVIDER NETWORK THAT CAN OFFER A TRUE MEDICAL HOME TO THESE CHILDREN WHETHER IN PERSON OR THROUGH TELEMEDICINE INITIATIVE. MY COLLEAGUES AND I AND EIGHT P. A CALIFORNIA STAFF LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PIECES TO THE SOLUTION BEING IDENTIFIED TODAY. CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN DESERVE NOTHING LESS THEY'RE COUNTING ON US THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR TESTIMONY APPRECIATE IT -- YOU HAS HEARD THE TESTIMNY PREVIOUSLY OF DCH US IN THE AUTHORED SEEMS LIKE NOBODY'S IN DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE AUDIT FINDINGS. AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT CAME OUT FROM IT I THINK FROM EACH YEAR TESTIMONIES THINK YOURS ARE TOUCHING ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS. OF THAT BUT LET ME JUST ASK. WHO COULD DO THIS FAIRLY QUICKLY AND JUST KIND OF RUN DOWN -- READ DOWN THE LINE IS LIKE. FOR THE IF YOU CAN ADD A RECOMMENDATION IN THE PERFORMANCE METRICS OF THE PERFORMANCE -- ACCOUNTABILITY STANDARDS. AS WE MOVE FORWARD WHAT WOULD THAT BE TO HELP GET TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT LEAVING CHILDREN BEHIND AND IN RECEIVING THESE PREVENTIVE SERVICES. I COULD JUST SAY BROUGHT BE LOOKING FOR A BROAD AND STABLE -- FORM OF FUNDING FOR INCREASED FROM THE FUNDING -- FOR PROVIDERS WHO WANT CARE FOR MEDI CAL PATIENTS. LIKE THE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES WHICH WE GET THROUGH PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX ARE BUT ON TOP OF THAT AS WELL [inaudible] YES. YOU WERE SPECIFICALLY ASKED ABOUT PERFORMANCE MEASURES YES -- I THINK I THINK THAT THE COURSE THAT THAT WERE ADOPTED IS AS A MORE ROBUST SET -- IT'S KIND OF AN ONGOING DISCUSSION NATIONALLY ABOUT WHAT THE RIGHT MEASURES ARE BUT I THINK TO THE POINT THAT -- MY COLLEAGUE MADE HAVING. MAKING SURE THAT THEIR SOME MINIMUM PERFORMANCE AND THAT THERE'S ROOM FOR GROWTH AND THAT -- THERE'S SORT OF A A PATH TO IMPROVEMENT AND SO HAVING SOME OF THOSE -- CHECKPOINTS ALONG THE WAY -- SO THAT THERE CAN BE COURSE CORRECTIONS IF NEEDED WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR HELPING PLANS DELIVER GOT IT AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA LOOK FORWARD. TO THAT FROM THE CHS OF THE INTERNAL CHECK INS WITH THE STATE AUDITOR ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OUTLINED. THANK YOU. PLEASE. I WOULD CERTAINLY AGREE WITH AND THE THINGS THAT ALREADY WERE SAID I I DO THINK SPEAKING TO RATES MATTER BUT I THINK IT'S OVER IT'S THE OVERALL FUNDING IT IS WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS. OPPORTUNITY SOME FOR SOME FLEXIBILITY TO INCENTIVIZE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT. THAT HAVE NOT BEEN AS MUCH IT HERE TOO THAT THAT REQUIRE A MORE HERE IT'S AND AND ACTUALLY BUILDING IN SOME OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE SURE THOSE METRICS ARE. FOLLOWED CAPTURED AND REPORTED IN -- AND THAT THE AND THAT THE PLANTS CAN ACTUALLY PARTNER WITH WITH OUR PROVIDERS IN ORDER TO DO THAT AND AND WORK WITH THE STATE AS WELL. ON THAT AND THEN ALSO AS WELL BUILDING IN SOME OF THOSE PROCESS OUT COMES TO MAKE SURE WE ARE HEADED THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND SOTHEIR INTERIM WAYS TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE ACCOUNTABLE IN BETWEEN -- BEFORE JUST -- SANCTIONING FOR NOT MEETING OVERALL OUTCOME. SO WOULD THAT BE LIKE PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR MAYBE ALLOCATING ADDITIONAL DOLLARS. BASED ON OUTCOMES. IT COULD BE ATTACHED TO THAT AS WELL I I WOULD ARGUE THAT SOMEONE IT IS ACTUALLY ALLOWING FOR AN APPROPRIATE TIME LINE FOR THAT INFRASTRUCTURE BUILD AND FOR THOSE METRICS. TO BE CAPTURED REPORTED CORRECTLY SO FOR EXAMPLE THE AT PRESENT TIME THE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SANCTIONS TO START NEXT YEAR FOR THE WHAT IS BEING MEASURED THIS YEAR AND THOSE EXTRA METRIC OR ALREADY PUT IN JUST FOR THIS YEAR. RIGHT SO TO HAVE THAT SORT OF LARGE DICK PUT ON JUST ONE YEAR AFTER ADDING IN NEW METRICS THAT ARE JUST HAVE NOT BEEN BUILT INTO. THE NORMAL REPORTING STRUCTURE AND A STANDS -- I WOULD I WOULD ARGUE IS IS -- MORE SEVERE AND ACTUALLY WOULD PROBABLY LEAD TO A DID A DIS INCENTIVIZING SOME OF THE BEHAVIOR I ALSO WANT TO KNOW YOU KNOW WHERE THAT SANCTION MONEY GO BECAUSE THEORETICALLY YOU WANT THAT MONEY TO BE USED -- TO FIND ACTUALLY MEETING THOSE METRICS AND MAKING SURE THOSE PROVIDERS ARE CONSISTENTLY DOING SO AND EMPOWERING ALL THE ENTITIES THAT ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN -- SO I WOULD ARGUE THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU WOULD HAVE -- A GREAT IS SCHEDULE AND AND ACTUALLY HAVE SOME. SOME IN A ROOM I'M STEPS THAT NEED TO BE MET TO MEET THAT OVERALL OUTCOMES -- AT AS RIGHT NOW THE RECOMMENDATIONS JUST TO JUMP FROM 25250% MINIMUM PERMISSIBLE ON ALL METRICS INCLUDING ALL THE NEW METRICS. AND FOR A PLAN LIKE OURS THAT -- SERVICE TWENTY NINE COUNTIES -- THAT IS IT THAT'S A THAT'S A LARGE CHANGE IT AT ONE TIME NOT ONE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY PUSHING BACK ON YOU KNOW WITH THE INTENTION AND THAT IT SHOULD BE DONE IT'S JUST THAT. WE ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO TO TO ACTUALLY MEET THOSE METRICS AND AND HAVE THAT HAPPEN IN THAT TIME LINE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN JUST. NEXT YEAR FOR SANCTIONS. THANK YOU. PLEASE. I WOULD OFFER A FEW SUGGESTIONS -- I THINK FIRST DOCTOR LOWEST POINT IF WE'RE GOING TO BE FOR I THINK WE SHOULD WE NEED IS PLANS VERY VERY SPECIFIC AND WELL DEFINED WHAT WHEN A NEW MEASUREMENTS WOULD BE. AND ALSO THE TIME ALLOWED TO SET UP -- WHATEVER SYSTEMS ARE PROCESSES THAT WE CAN. GO TO ATTACK THOSE MEASURES FOR EXAMPLE. IF OUR PLAN WAS TO DECIDE TO WAY -- TO HELP INCREASE DEBT LEVELS WOULD BE TO ALTER OPPOSITION INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO REWARD PHYSICIANS FOR GETTING MEMBERS AND TO MEET THESE. NEW GUIDELINES THAT WORKED COLLECTED BEFORE WE NEED TIME TO SET THAT UP AND CHANGE PROVIDER CONTRACTS AND ALL THAT SO -- I DON'T THINK BY AS WAS STATED EARLIER THAT WERE ALREADY TOMORROW WILL BE AND FOUR MONTHS INTO THE YEAR AND WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THINGS FINALIZED I DON'T THINK NEXT YEAR'S RESULTS. CAN BE A WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT THAN THIS YEAR'S -- AND THEN THE SECOND THING I WOULD SAY IS AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE SPECIFIC THINGS I WOULD DRILL DOWN AS TO ON THIS SPECIFIC AREAS FOR EXAMPLE. YOU KNOW ZERO FIVE FOR THE MOST PART TO READ THE RESULTS ARE ARE PRETTY WELL PRETTY GOOD IT'S THE ADOLESCENCE THAT ALWAYS BEEN DIFFICULT AND THAT THEY HAVE ADOLESCENT WELL VISITS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DIFFICULT NAY BEEN HE JUST MEASURE FOR A LONG TIME. IT IS CONCEALING DIFFICULT TO GET THESE KIDS IN TO THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE -- EITHER AT A KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT OR I'LL FOCUS ON HOW WE CAN -- COLLECTIVELY FIGURE OUT WAYS TO DO THAT BECAUSE I THINK GETTING ADOLESCENT WELL DOES IT'S UP CHALLENGE OTHERWISE I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT VERY SPECIFICS AND AND TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS AND SO AND TO HOW WE CAN BEST OBTAIN. WHAT WE'RE SHOOTING? FOR AND TO THOSE POINTS DO YOU SEE THAT HAPPENING SOLELY THROUGH EDUCATION OR IS IT TOO YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR TESTIMONY AS WELL -- INCREASED -- YOU KNOW MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATES ARE INCREASED REACH FOR THOSE DOCTORS ARE PROVIDING THE SERVICES OF THE HARD TO SERVE AREAS. I SEE IT IS THAT LIKE A PUSH PULL STRATEGY WHICH IS AFTER HOPEFULLY PROVIDERS AT THE REWARDED I WOULD DO IT IN A SENTENCE. BUT THEY WOULD BRING A MAN. TO BRING A MAN WE AND WE PUSH OUT -- MEMBER NOTIFICATIONS OR YOU KNOW TO THE MEMBER NEWSLETTERS OR FOR I KNOW THERE'S BEEN TALK ABOUT USING TEXTING PROGRAMS -- GETTING TO MEMBERS AT AS MICRO LEVEL AS POSSIBLE THAT'S VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES THE INFORMATION WE HAVE ON THEM. IT'S NOT ACCURATE CELL PHONE NUMBERS ON ACKER THEY'VE CHANGED SO WE GET TO THE MEMBERS THEMSELVES OF THEIR HEAD OF THE HOUSEHOLD OF THE PARENTS. IS ARE ON A MICRO LEVEL IS VERY DIFFICULT I MEAN WE'RE A SMALL PLAN WE HAVE. HUNDRED THOUSAND KIDS -- SO IT'S IT'S A CHALLENGE BUT I WOULD DO THAT I WOULD I WOULD FOCUS ON THE MEMBER SITE PUSHING OUT GETTING. IS MUCH INFORMATION OUT AS WE CAN BUT THEN ENCOURAGE THE PROVIDERS ON THE OTHER END TO HELP ENCOURAGE AND TO PULL THEM IN TO SAY HEY ONE IT'S TIME FOR YOUR YOUR SON YOUR DAUGHTERS -- WELL YOU KNOW WELL I LESSEN VISIT LET'S SCHEDULE SOMETHING THANK YOU. IN CONTRAST TO SOME OF THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS REGARDING MORE TIME WE'D ARGUE THAT THERE HAS. BEEN LONG STANDING REQUIREMENTS OF FEDERAL AND STATE OF SPECIFICALLY THINKING UP THE BLOOD LEAD TESTING REQUIREMENT FOR ALL MEDI CAL CHILDREN AGE TWELVE AND TWENTY FOUR MONTHS. AND THE THE THE REALLY ABYSMAL RATE OF OF TESTING AND SO THIS IS BEEN A LONGSTANDING REQUIREMENT -- PLANS -- DATA CAN RANGE FROM LESS THAN A HALF TO A QUARTER OF CHILDREN -- RECEIVING THE ACTUAL TESTING AND SOAK CERTAINLY GREATER OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY IF NEEDED -- AS WELL AS EDUCATION TO TO PROVIDERS AS THIS IS SPECIFIC TO TO MEDI CAL CHILDREN OTHER CHILDREN ARE. ARE NOT NECESSARILY REQUIRED -- TO AT TO HAVE THIS THIS BENEFIT THERE IS THE RECOGNITION THAT LOW INCOME CHILDREN LIVE IN OLDER HOUSES ARE MORE. SUSCEPTIBLE TO TO LEAD POISONING AND SO THIS IS A REQUIREMENT IN SO I WOULD SAY GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AS WELL AS EDUCATION TO PROVIDERS. UP AND PLANTS. UNTIL THAT POINT I BELIEVE THERE'S A I REQUEST OR SOME LEGISLATION ON THAT POINT EXACTLY. SO AND I THINK THAT'S MOVING FORWARD AND YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME OTHER SOLUTION DR WOODS GOT. ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN FORTY TWO TO HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE GUEST IMPROVING ACCESS REALLY EVELYN DOCTOR WOULD SPEAK TO THAT -- ACTUAL WE JUST GO IN. THE DOCTOR WOULD [inaudible] THANK YOU -- I USED TO BEING CUED UP LIKE THAT BUT I CRESCENTA -- I JUST -- I GUESS WHEN I GO BACK TO THE PHONE YOU BACK MORE TO QUESTIONS TO THE DIRECTLY TO THE PLANTS AND ON THIS AND I APPRECIATE APPRECIATE APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S TESTIMONY BUT I'M I'M. BROKE ONE OF FOCUS HERE FOR A MINUTE -- WHEN YOU'RE SETTING UP YOUR NETWORK -- PROVIDERS -- YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY YOUR PROVIDERS. WHAT'S THE STARTING POINT FOR NEGOTIATIONS WERE YOU START YOU START AT THE MEDICAL RATE DO YOU STARTED A COMMERCIAL RATE I MEAN. IT'S OBVIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO GET PROVIDERS -- IN IN SOME OF THESE PLANS SO WHERE DO YOU START. WELL IT DEPENDS ON THE PROVIDER CLASSIFICATION FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS WE WE CAPITATE THEM AND THE CAPITATION RATES BASED ON THE ACUITY OF THEIR THEIR PATIENTS SO WE CAN GO UP OR DOWN. AND THEN WE ALSO -- DO A POSITION IN CENTER PROGRAM WORK GROUP THAT REWARDS THE PHYSICIANS FOR DOING ACTIVITIES THAT WE SUPPORT LIKE HAVING -- LATE HOURS OR OR BEING OPEN THE WEEKENDS SENATE ON THOSE LINES AND THAT'S FAIRLY STANDARD -- IT'S IT'S AN ACTUAL I ARE BASED ON THE SPECIALISTS -- IT'S BASICALLY A CALM IT'S A COMBINATION OF HOW MUCH. IN DEMAND THEY ARE AND SO WE PAY OFF THE MEDICARE FEE SCHEDULE. AND DEPENDING ON HOW -- MUCH BELOW OR ABOVE THEN IT DEPENDS ON THE SCARCITY OF THE PROVIDER AND DEMAND FOR THEIR SERVICES. IT ALSO INVOLVES THE DESPITE THE THE SPECIALTY MEANING WE CAN CERTAINLY PAY A NEUROLOGIST MORE. BECAUSE WE DON'T USE THEM. HIS OFTEN THEY WOULDN'T BE SHE SAID SHE WOULD LIKE AND BUT I WILL BE. SO IT'S IT'S BASED ON THE DEMAND FOR THEIR SERVICES -- COMPETITION. AND THEN -- YEAH THE THOSE TWO THINGS IN THERE AND WE WE'RE WE'RE PRETTY FLEXIBLE IN TERMS OF WITH DIFFERENT PROVIDERS THE LET'S SAY THAT THE PROVIDERS NOT WILLING TO THE CONTRACT MEDI CAL SCHEDULE -- YOU KNOW -- YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SPECIALIST YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE NAME OF THE HOSPITAL IN YOUR NETWORK -- YOU DO YOU CAN YOU THEN. BEGIN [inaudible] TO NEGOTIATE UPWARD. DEPENDING YES DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH WE NEED THAT POSITION IN OUR NETWORK ABSOLUTELY -- SO WHAT HAPPENS -- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO THAT WHAT'S THE RESPONSE FROM THE STATE AS THEY GO BACK AND EVALUATE WHAT'S BEEN YOUR EXPERIENCE AS WELL? MY EXPERIENCE AND I'M NOT -- I DON'T DEAL WITH THE THE RATE PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY MY EXPERIENCE AS THEY LOOK AT OUR PHYSICIAN COSTS IN TOTALITY. AND THEY MAY LOOK AT DIFFERENT SPECIALTIES -- INDIVIDUAL DOWN USUALLY THEY'LL SAY HEY HOW COME YOU'RE PAYING -- THIS NEUROSURGEON SO MUCH AND ALSO HE'S THE ONLY ONE IN A HUNDRED MILES -- AND AND THEY HAVE A FULL WAITING ROOM. WITH OR WITHOUT MEDI CAL PATIENTS SO THIS IS WHAT WE HAD TO DO TO ENSURE ACCESS AND THAT'S USUALLY SUFFICIENT -- I THINK IF IT WAS ON A A BROAD BASIS WHERE YOU'RE -- THAT I WOULD SAY OVER PAIN BUT PAIN PROVIDERS. IN AND SIGNIFICANT EXCESS OVER YEAH HE IS MEDI CAL OR MEDICARE FEE SCHEDULE SO YOU WOULD YOU WOULD LIKELY GET MORE IN DEPTH QUESTIONS -- INTEREST INTERESTING SO. IF YOU COULD JUST IN GENERAL -- HAD TO CATEGORIZE YOU KNOW THE THE CHALLENGES YOU HAVE WITH -- PHYSICIANS AND NUMBERS OF PHYSICIANS THAT SORT OF THING -- IS IT THE SPECIALIST THAT YOU HAVE THE HARDEST TIME. YOU KNOW AS FAR AS GETTING PROVIDERS OR IS IT PRIMARY CARE. I MEAN I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WITH SPECIALTY PROVIDERS LIKE A YOU KNOW A PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGIST OR NO FRAUD JUST OR SOMETHING YOU KNOW OR NEUROLOGISTS SPECIFICALLY AROUND PEDIATRICS THAT'S A DIFFERENT ISSUE BUT IN GENERAL -- WHERE ARE YOU WHERE IS THE WORD WHERE IS THE MOST DIFFICULT TIME YOU HAVE IT AS FAR AS PROVIDER BASE I DON'T NOW I THINK SPEND THE WRIST TO SPEAKING TO THAT I LEAD THE CLINICAL ARM MOSTLY AT THE PLAN AND SO I PURPOSEFULLY STATE OUT OF THE SPECIFICS OF THE RATES CONVERSATION ALTHOUGH I KNOW I KNOW MR EVEN THOUGH THE MORE THAN I DO -- BUT I'D SAY -- AS FAR AS EXPERIENCE WITH -- THE PROVIDER SIDE OF THINGS -- PRIMARY CARE IS NOT IS NOT TYPICALLY THE ISSUE IT IS MUCH MORE THE SPECIALTY CARE AND EVEN THE SUB SUB SPECIALISTS FOR PARTICULAR COMPLEX CONDITIONS NO TERTIARY CARE SETTINGS OUR PARTICULAR -- INPATIENT FACILITIES -- AND FOLLOW UP HARDER TO FIND IN THAT VERY MUCH VARIES INDEFINITELY IS GEOGRAPHY WITHIN THE STATE WE WE HAVE LESS PROBLEM FINDING THAT IN LOS ANGELES OBVIOUSLY THAT ANY OF OUR RURAL COUNTIES AND SO THOSE THINGS GO INTO ACCOUNT WHEN WHERE YOU KNOW CONTRACTING AND -- AS WE -- FEEDBACK FEED MEMBERS TO THOSE OF PROVIDERS BASED ON THOSE NEEDS BUT IT'S DEFINITELY THE SPECIALTY CATEGORY JEFF I CAN ADD IT IN OUR AREA WE HAVE A NAPA ANY WILLING PROVIDER PHILOSOPHY WHICH MEANS YOU LEADER TERMS CONDITIONS WILL CONTRACT WITH YOU AND AS I SAID WE BASICALLY HAVE CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH ALMOST EVERY PROVIDER IN THE TWO COUNTIES THE ONES WE WOULDN'T HAVE WOULD BE PROVIDERS THAT HAVE A CONCIERGE SERVICE OR MAYBE WORK AT UNIVERSITIES -- SO WE REALLY ALMOST HAVE EVERYBODY AND AND IF A PROVIDER MOVES IN THE AREA WE KNOW ABOUT IT AND ARE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR WITH YOU KNOW MY FRIENDS TO INTRODUCE OURSELVES SO WE AGGRESSIVE THAT MAKING SURE THAT OUR NETWORK IS A ROBUST AS POSSIBLE LOCAL THEIR WAR MY FRIENDS BECAUSE YOU KNOW NO NO NO ONE WANTS A COLD STILL ONE SO -- WELL I REPORT THANK YOU -- I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR PERSPECTIVES ON ON THE SIDE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT WE'RE GONNA OPEN THIS TO PUBLIC COMMENT THANK YOU ALL THANK YOU HERE THIS IS BEEN REALLY REALLY HELPFUL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I GET THIS POINT WOULD LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND OPEN THIS TO PUBLIC COMMENT -- TO HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WANTING TO SPEAK A PUBLIC COMMENT THESE KIND OF RAISE YOUR HANDS I GUESS AND ROUGH IDEA OKAY YOU CAN LIMIT YOU KNOW TO A COUPLE MINUTES EACH THAT WOULD BE GREAT THINGS OF THE LADY ONE REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA SCHOOL NURSES ORGANIZATION I THINK ABOUT A WEEK AGO I MADE SIMILAR COMMENTS AND THE ISSUE I THINK IS THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE HIDDEN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PREVENTION IF YOU LOOK AT THE BRIGHT FUTURES EVERY ONE OF THESE IS LISTED IN THE AD CODE PRIOR TO KIDS COMING INTO SCHOOL THEY HAVE TO SHOW PROOF OF IMMUNIZATIONS NO SCHOOLS NO SCHOOL NO SHOTS NO SCHOOL AND THEY HAVE TO SHOW PROOF OF PHYSICAL EXAMS THERE APPEARED IT PERIODICITY ALL SCALES WITH IN THE ED CODE THAT COVERAGE EACH ONE OF THESE IT'S SO THE SCHOOL CERTAINLY OUR PLACE WHERE YOU CAN HAVE -- PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES AND PROGRAMS AND IN FACT THEY ARE PROVIDED THE -- -- I ALSO THINK THAT SCHOOLS ARE GREAT COLLABORATORS AND SO THAT IF WE CAN SET UP A PROCESS WHEREBY WE CAN INTERACT IN CORAL AUG COLLABORATE WITH THE HEALTH PLANS IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT SOME OF THE -- SOME OF THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE NOT BEING PROVIDED THROUGH MEDICARE ON OUT BY THE HEALTH PLANS WE CAN START TO ADDRESS THOSE AND SO -- I'M NOT SAYING TO YOU THAT SCHOOL HEALTH HAS BEEN IN THE SCHOOLS FOR WELL OVER A HUNDRED YEARS STARTED IN NINETEEN OH FIVE AND CITY OF NEW YORK AND ESSEX CERTAINLY HAS EXPANDED WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF OF SCHOOL NURSES SCHOOL COUNSELOR SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST AND SO YOU KNOW WE STAND READY TO TO ASSIST IN LOOKING AT THE SIX POINT TWO MILLION KIDS IN THE SCHOOLS IN TERMS OF PROVIDING PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES AND PROGRAMS THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THAT WHAT'S ONE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MENTIONED EARLIER WAS SAYING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE GRAPHS AND WHEN KIDS GO TO SCHOOL IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY KNOWING WHICH SERVICES ARE OUT THERE TO TAXES WE SHOULD THAT PLEASE PROCEED GOOD AFTERNOON ON A HOUSE OF THAT -- WITH UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIA -- AND WE JUST WANTED TO SAY FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU TO DOCTOR WOULD AND REALLY BRING FORTH THIS AUDIT MAKING THE REQUESTED J. LACK -- AND AND WE WERE PROUD PARTNERS OF OF THAT PROCESS -- WITH CHILDREN NOW THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND -- AND UNITED WAYS ALONG WITH FOR FIVE FIRST FIVE -- AND WE ANTICIPATED AS ADVOCATES AS IS ON THE WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER SAID SO CLEARLY YOU KNOW WE ANTICIPATED SOMETHING LIKE THIS COMING OUT -- WHAT WE REALLY WANTED WAS IT TO BE ON PAPER SO THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH SO THAT WE CAN SAY WE ARE ALL LOOKING AT THE SAME THING HAVING THE SAME DEFINITIONS AND UNDERSTANDING OF A VERY COMPLEX SYSTEM -- BUT THAT WE CAN THEN USE THAT -- TO CREATE PATHWAYS FORWARD -- WE THINK IN PARTICULAR CALLING OUT THROUGH THIS PROCESS THE PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE -- AND THAT THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO COALESCE AROUND WHOLE CHILD HEALTH -- TO MAKE SOME OF THE PROMISES THAT WE'VE MADE TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES TRUE AND ACCURATE TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITIES AND WE STAND AS READY PARTNERS ALWAYS THROUGH THIS PROCESS -- AND WE THANK YOU FOR CONVENING THIS HEARING DETAILED PERSPECTIVE -- AND THOUGHTS AND -- OPPORTUNITIES TO MOVE FORWARD -- IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE IN WRITTEN FORM THANK YOU AGAIN THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON KELLY BEING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL -- I WANTED TO SECOND -- DOCTOR ABLE NICHOLS TESTIMONY EARLIER AND NOTE AS SOME WOMEN SALAS MENTIONED -- ALL OF PROPOSITION THIRTY SIX WAS RETURNED BY THE GOVERNOR TO SUPPLEMENT PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT RATES IN VARIOUS FORMS -- INCLUDING BABIES PAYMENTS AND TRAUMA SCREENING MEASURES WE SEE THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS AS A WAY TO LEAPFROG THE CAREFULLY DESIGNED CAPITATED RATE DETERMINATION SYSTEM THAT DH CS DESCRIBED BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE THE ONLY TOOL HOWEVER CARE PLANS ADMINISTRATION OF THESE PAYMENTS IS CRITICAL IN ATTRACTING NEW PROVIDERS RETAINING EXISTING PROVIDERS NEARING RETIREMENT AND ALSO INCREASING EXISTING PROVIDERS MEDI CAL PATIENT MIX -- I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION THE LOAN REPAYMENT UNDER PROP FIFTY SIX -- THOSE APPLICATIONS CLOSE ON FRIDAY THE SYSTEM WAS OVERWHELMED AND WE EXTENDED THE DEADLINE FOR A FEW DAYS -- BUT IT DOES SHOW RECENT GRADUATES WILLINGNESS TO SERVE MEDICAL POPULATION WITH THE FINANCIAL CHALLENGE OF GRADUATING WITH ESSENTIALLY A HOUSE PAYMENT PROCESS AND REVIEWED OVER EIGHT HUNDRED APPLICATIONS WITH -- SEVEN HUNDRED PENDING ALMOST SEVEN HUNDRED WYOMING SO -- THEY'VE INDICATED THAT A HUNDRED FIFTY ORTIZ WILL BE ANNOUNCED AT THE END OF JUNE -- AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW MANY OF THOSE AREN'T PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE AREAS LIKE SAN COME MENTIONED AND I'M SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY AND WE STAND READY WITH YOU ALL TO EVALUATE DIFFERENT PROPOSALS AND INCREASING AB POSITIONS IN CERTAIN AND -- UNDERSERVED AREAS THANK YOU THANK YOU LOOK FOR THEM SERVING AN FQHC SITES GOOD AFTERNOON THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP FOR STATEWIDE CHILD POLICY AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION THANK YOU TO THE CO CHAIRS FOR HAVING THIS IMPORTANT HEARING A DOCTOR WOULD FOR HAVING REQUESTED THIS AUDIT AS YOU HAVE HEARD THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL WORK TO DO TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN ENROLLED IN MEDICARE A POPULATION OF CHILDREN THAT IS DISPROPORTIONATELY LOW INCOME CHILDREN OF COLOR WE OFTEN HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IF EVERYTHING IS A PRIORITY NOTHING IS A PRIORITY CLEARLY AS THIS AUDIT HAS SHOWN CHILDREN HAVE NOT BEEN A PRIORITY IN OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM IS THE THE COVERAGE MODEL HAS EMPHASIZED HIGH USERS THOSE WITH MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS THOSE WITH THE MOST COSTLY HEALTH CARE TO OUR MEDI CAL PROGRAM AN IMPORTANT POPULATION TO THOUGHTFULLY MANAGE THEIR CARE HOWEVER THE REALITY HAS BEEN THAT CHILDREN FOR THE MOST PART WERE GIVEN INSUFFICIENT ATTENTION AS WE EXPECT AND REQUIRE CALIFORNIA FAMILIES TO JUGGLE MULTIPLE PRIORITIES SO TOO SHOULD WE EXPECT OUR DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ALSO DO THE SAME THANKFULLY THE NEW ADMINISTRATION HAS EXPLICITLY SAID CHILDREN AS A PRIORITY RECOGNIZING THAT AND INVESTMENT IN CHILDREN'S WELL BEING IS ULTIMATELY AND INVESTMENT IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA FOCUSING ON EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT NOT ONLY SAID CHILDREN OFF FOR A RIGHT EARLY START IN THEIR LIFE IT ALSO ENSURES THAT GENERATIONS OF CHILDREN THAT BECOME HEALTHIER ADULTS WHO WILL OSTENSIBLY HAVE FAR FEWER COMORBIDITIES TO MANAGE A LONG TERM GAIN FOR MEDI CAL PROGRAM OVERALL AND WHILE THE AYE IT OUTLINES A SOBERING SITUATION FOR CHILDREN IN MEDIC HOW IT ALSO OFFERS GREAT OPPORTUNITY ITS RECOMMENDATIONS TRULY SERVE AS A BLUEPRINT FOR ACTION WITH THE NEW SIM ADMINISTRATION'S FOCUS ON HEALTHY EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND THE LEGISLATURE'S COMMITMENT AND CLEAR INTEREST IN ADDRESSING THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE CAN MAKE TREMENDOUS STRIDES IN IMPROVING CHILDREN'S CARE THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND THE ADMINISTRATION TO FULFILL THE PROMISE OF HEALTH AND WELL BEING FOR EVERY CHILD IN OUR STATE THANK YOU THANK YOU MARTY EMOTO FROM A FAMILY MEMBER MY OLDER SISTER DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WITH THE CALIFORNIA DISABILITY SENIOR TO ME ACTION NETWORK AND THE CALIFORNIA PERSON CENTERED ADVOCACY PARTNERSHIP FIRST WANT TO THANK THE THE JOINT BUDGET JOINT LEGISLATIVE AJ AUDIT COMMITTEE AND THE FOR DOING THIS HEARING AND ALSO FOR THE -- THE REPORT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES -- EVEN THOUGH THE THE REPORTED INDICATES A MAJOR PROBLEMS YOU KNOW IN TERMS OF -- CHILDREN'S -- ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE WE ALSO HAVE WORK WITH DEPARTMENT ON OTHER ISSUES AND THEY HAVE BEEN REALLY RESPONSIVE UP THIRD I'M I'M ON THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES ADVISORY COMMITTEE I JUST WANT TO COMMENT ON THE ISSUE OF REDUCING DISPARITIES AND ITS IMPACT ON CHILDREN'S ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE IS A MAJOR ISSUE IN IT WAS BROUGHT OUT IN THE AUDIT REPORT I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST ALSO THE DEPARTMENTS REALLY START WORKING TOGETHER TO THAT EFFORTS TO REDUCE DISPARITIES AREN'T SIDELOAD IN ONE DEPARTMENT NONE OTHER WORDS I SERVE ON THE DIRECTORS DISPARITIES ADVISORY COMMITTEE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF BUILT MOST SERVICES TO REDUCE DISPARITIES WITHIN THE REGIONAL CENTER SYSTEM BUT THOSE EFFORTS REALLY DON'T CROSS OVER TO THE OTHER HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES INCLUDING CHILDREN ACCESS MEDI CAL WHITE SUCCESS IN ALL AND MANY OTHER SERVICES BUT EACH DEPARTMENT TENDS TO HAVE THEIR OWN EFFORTS TO REDUCE DISPARITIES AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE MODELS OF WHOLE PERSON CARE MY FAMILY AND OTHER FAMILIES DON'T OPERATE IN SILOS ONLY THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DO AND SO REALLY WOULD URGE THAT EFFORTS TO REDUCE DISPARITIES CROSSOVER THE DEPARTMENTS AND THE SYSTEMS AND AGAIN PRECIADO ALL THE EFFORTS OF BY THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- JUST GOT OFF A COUPLE CLOSING REMARKS AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO MY THANKED EVERYONE FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION HERE TODAY I THINK WE -- CAN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT AND HOW THE STATE SO MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PROGRAM -- DELIVERY SYSTEM WORKS FOR THE FIVE AND A HALF MILLION CHILDREN RECEIVING SERVICES WE CAN DO MUCH BETTER BUT I AM ENCOURAGED BY THE DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSE WITH THE CABBIE OUT I THINK INCREASING THE NUMBER OF QUALITY MEASURES PERFORMANCE LEVEL PLANS HAVE TO ME -- AND EMPLOYING A STRONGER STICK ENFORCEMENT ARE GOOD STEPS -- WE ALSO NEED TO IMPROVE HOW WE MONITOR TIMELY ACCESS TO SERVICES ENSURE OUR REACH TO CHILDREN AND FAMILIES -- IS TAKING PLACE AND WE NEED TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT -- BENEFICIARY TRAVEL TIMES -- WHEN PLANS FILE FOR ALTERNATIVE REQUEST BUT I WAS ALSO A BELIEVER THAT SOMETIMES THE STICK ISN'T ALWAYS THE BEST APPROACH -- I I I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN CARROTS AS WELL -- I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WANT TO KNOW THAT THOSE THAT THE THE THE CARE THE STATE IS PAYING FOR IS BEING PROVIDED -- AND INCONSISTENT WITH THE RECOMMENDED STANDARDS FOR CARE -- AS WE COVER MORE MORE PEOPLE AND STRIVE TO GET HAVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- IT'S CLEAR WE HAVE SERVICES TO A SERIOUS CHALLENGES WITH PROVIDERS WITH RATES -- AND -- WHAT I FEAR AND I'VE SAID THIS MANY TIMES IS THAT AS WE GET CLOSER AND CLOSER TO WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE ACCESS THAT WERE NOT DELIVERING THE CARE AND THAT WE'RE SIMPLY GOING TO BE BE DELIVERING AN EMPTY PROMISE AND THAT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST A SERVICE OF ALL TO CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU THE RIGHT TO WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR TESTIFYING HERE TODAY SHE THE AUDITOR'S REPORT AND HER STAFF TIME IN IDENTIFYING THESE ISSUES AND LIKE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY STATED BEFORE I BELIEVE THAT'S A BLUEPRINT TOWARDS TRYING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE -- INADEQUACIES AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT LEAVING MILLIONS OF CHILDREN BEHIND THAT CAN RECEIVE THESE PREVENTIVE SERVICES I KNOW THERE'S LOTS OF STUDIES OUT THERE THAT SHOW US THAT WHEN YOU CATCH THINGS EARLY ON ON THE PREVENTATIVE SIDE IT SAVES CALIFORNIANS MILLIONS ON THE BACKEND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE SEE THEM AND EMERGENCY ROOMS AND SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE SIXTY DAY -- CHECKUP WHICH WILL BE IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS AND ONE YEAR AND SEE WERE GOING I THINK WE HEARD TESTIMONY EARLIER ABOUT LOTS OF PEOPLE THAT WANT TO PARTNER AND TRY TO GET AT THE GOAL WOULD OUR GOAL IS MAKING SURE THAT WERE CHILDREN AND AND CALIFORNIANS ARE ACTUALLY RECEIVING THE PREVENTATIVE CARE -- THAT THEY NEED AND SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH D. CH US AND MY CO CHAIR DOCTOR WOULD AND EVERYONE THE TESTIFIED HERE TODAY AND ENSURING -- THOSE OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT ONLY JUST CONCLUDE BY ALSO THINKING -- THE MEMBERS I SHOWED UP FOR TODAY'S -- HEARING OBVIOUSLY DOCTOR WOULD WAS HERE -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL ASSEMBLY WOMAN ANGER CURRY ASSEMBLY WOMAN WALDRON ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS AND SENATOR MORE LOCK IN WITH THAT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND CONCLUDE AT TODAY'S JOINT HEARING IT'S FOUR THIRTY AND THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE
