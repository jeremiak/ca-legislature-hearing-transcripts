00:49:09.146 --> 00:49:10.514
THAT I FOUND AND I ACTUALLY

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.683
BODY FOR DISPLAY HERE. IS THE

00:49:12.749 --> 00:49:15.819

KIDS WERE CORNERING THEMSELVES

00:49:34.137 --> 00:49:36.106
EITHER IN THE LIBRARY OR YOU

00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:38.809

KIDS AND IT'S ABSOLUTELY

00:49:41.678 --> 00:49:43.080

COMPUTERS THINGS LIKE THAT. AND

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:21.017
THEIR THIRD THEY LOOK LIKE THEY

00:50:21.084 --> 00:50:23.487
DON'T LOOK LIKE WHAT YOU WOULD

00:50:23.553 --> 00:50:24.054
THINK THEY LOOK LIKE IT'S IT

00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:25.522
LIKE A DISGUISE. AM I GUESS MY

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:27.824
QUESTION IS IT- I LOOK AT THESE

00:50:27.891 --> 00:50:29.793
THINGS LIKE FOR CANNABIS AND

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:31.862
THEM YOU KNOW GUMMY BEARS LOLLY

00:50:31.928 --> 00:50:35.766
POPS COOKIES. THE ALL THESE

00:50:35.832 --> 00:50:37.634
THINGS THAT ARE ARE HIDDEN

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:38.235
THINGS AS WELL YOU KNOW LIKE

00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:40.437
GUMMY BEARS. LOOK LIKE CANDY TO

00:50:40.504 --> 00:50:42.539
KIDS. BUT THERE CANNABIS M.

00:50:42.606 --> 00:50:43.707
IT'S CANNABIS AND I NOTICE

00:50:43.774 --> 00:50:45.509
THAT. YOU MADE SOME COMMENTS

00:50:45.575 --> 00:50:46.943
ABOUT THE INCREASE IN THE USAGE

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:48.912
OF AB IN- FOR FLAVOR PRODUCTS

00:50:48.979 --> 00:50:50.547
BUT MARIJUANA LEGAL

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:52.716
LEGALIZATION SINCE IT'S BEEN

00:50:52.783 --> 00:50:54.518
INCEPTION IN TWO THOUSAND SIX-

00:50:54.584 --> 00:50:56.920
IT'S ROSY EXPOSURES WAS ABOUT A

00:50:56.987 --> 00:50:59.856
148% AND EVEN IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:50:59.923 --> 00:51:00.957
ON EXECUTIVE ORDER HE

00:51:01.024 --> 00:51:02.392
HIGHLIGHTED RATES OF YOUTH USE

00:51:02.459 --> 00:51:04.094
OF THE CIGARETTES AT TEN POINT

00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:05.495
FOUR PERCENT. AND WHILE

00:51:05.562 --> 00:51:07.063
CANNABIS WAS AT FOURTEEN POINT

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:09.800
9% SO IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THE

00:51:09.866 --> 00:51:11.067
DATA SHOWS THAT CANNABIS IS

00:51:11.134 --> 00:51:13.336
MORE- AFFECTING OUR YOUTH MORE

00:51:13.403 --> 00:51:14.638
THAN WHAT THE E. CIGARETTE

00:51:14.704 --> 00:51:16.573
FLAVORS ARE. AND SO I GUESS

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.408
GIVEN THAT THE CDC IS ALSO

00:51:18.475 --> 00:51:20.043
ATTRIBUTED THAT THE RECENT LUNG

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:22.379
INFECTION AND THE OUTBREAK OUR

00:51:22.446 --> 00:51:24.714
OUR TTC VAPING PRODUCTS AND

00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:25.649
WE'RE NOT USING THAT ARGUMENT

00:51:25.715 --> 00:51:27.717
FOR THIS ANYMORE- IT SEEMS LIKE

00:51:27.784 --> 00:51:29.186
THAT THE CANNABIS RATES. THAT

00:51:29.252 --> 00:51:30.887
AFFECTED ARE YOU SHOULD BE MORE

00:51:30.954 --> 00:51:34.991
ALARMING DâN AND- THEN-WHAT

00:51:35.058 --> 00:51:36.193
THESE LABOR EAT CIGARETTES ARE

00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:38.462
DOING SO AS- CAN YOU COMMENT ON

00:51:38.528 --> 00:51:40.464
THAT- BE HAPPY TO LISTEN TO

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:41.431
GROW THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION

00:51:41.498 --> 00:51:43.633
AND- I GUESS WHAT WE LOOK AT IN

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:45.569
THIS BILL IS CONCENTRATED ON.

00:51:45.635 --> 00:51:48.205
THE PREVALENCE AND THE

00:51:48.271 --> 00:51:49.873
DEVASTATING EFFECT OF TOBACCO

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.708
AND NICOTINE ADDICTION. WHEN

00:51:51.775 --> 00:51:53.109
YOU LOOK AT THE ADDICTION OR

00:51:53.176 --> 00:51:55.178
THE ADDICTIVE ASPECTS OF

00:51:55.245 --> 00:51:57.714
CANNABIS. OR ALCOHOL WE FIND

00:51:57.781 --> 00:52:00.517
THAT 31% OF TOBACCO USERS TO

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:02.552
DEVELOP DEPENDENCE ON TOBACCO

00:52:02.619 --> 00:52:04.321
SO IT'S A VERY ADDICTIVE.

00:52:04.387 --> 00:52:06.823
PRODUCT THAT- CERTAINLY

00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:08.725
CONTROLS THEIR LIFE AFTER THAT

00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:10.927
ADDICTION BUT WE'RE AS- A

00:52:10.994 --> 00:52:13.964
DEPENDENT ON TOBACCO COMPARED

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:14.865
TO FIFTEEN POINT 5% FOR. THE

00:52:14.931 --> 00:52:17.067
WHOLE YOU. ONLY AND ONE. ASIAN

00:52:17.133 --> 00:52:19.236
ONLY EVEN THOUGH IT SIGNIFICANT.

00:52:19.302 --> 00:52:21.905
9% OF CANNABIS USERS ACTUALLY

00:52:21.972 --> 00:52:24.274
BECOME ADDICTED TO THE PRODUCT

00:52:24.341 --> 00:52:24.875
SO WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE

00:52:24.941 --> 00:52:26.610
MOST. PREVALENT THE MOST

00:52:26.676 --> 00:52:28.311
DESTRUCTIVE AND THE MOST

00:52:28.378 --> 00:52:30.347
ADDICTIVE PRODUCT ON THE MARKET

00:52:30.413 --> 00:52:33.316
TODAY. TO PREVENT- THAT TYPE OF

00:52:33.383 --> 00:52:35.018
ADDICTION BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO

MORE. THE EVIDENCE IN TERMS OF

00:52:43.126 --> 00:52:44.528
THE SCIENTIFIC ASPECT OF THE

00:52:44.594 --> 00:52:47.097
ADDICTION AND THE NEED FOR.

00:52:47.163 --> 00:52:49.466
TOBACCO FLAVOR PROHIBITION

00:52:49.533 --> 00:52:51.801
RATHER THAN THE CANNABIS ISSUE.

00:52:51.868 --> 00:52:53.870
OKAY OKAY HELLO DOES MAKE NOTE

00:52:53.937 --> 00:52:55.071
GIVEN THE TIME CONSTRAINTS OF

00:52:55.138 --> 00:52:56.540

SO I'M I ALSO KNOW THAT. I'M

00:53:11.821 --> 00:53:13.356
YEAH I KEEP THINKING HOW WE-

00:53:13.423 --> 00:53:13.924
THESE TWO IN. IN THE CAMPUS

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:15.191
INDUSTRY IS GETTING  TAX

00:53:15.258 --> 00:53:16.359
REDUCTION AND THERE'S ANOTHER

00:53:16.426 --> 00:53:17.827
BILL THAT REQUIRES A TAX

00:53:17.894 --> 00:53:20.430
INCREASE ON IN THE BUT AND THAT

00:53:20.497 --> 00:53:21.197
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT'S

00:53:21.264 --> 00:53:22.866
COMING OUT. AND THEY'VE

00:53:22.933 --> 00:53:24.668
DISCUSSED A TAX INCREASE ON-

00:53:24.734 --> 00:53:26.736
THESE E. CIGARETTE PRODUCTS.

00:53:26.803 --> 00:53:27.804
AND THEY'RE ESTIMATING THAT

00:53:27.871 --> 00:53:29.940
IT'S GOING TO BE PRIDE SIX

00:53:30.006 --> 00:53:30.507
HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILLION

00:53:30.574 --> 00:53:32.108
DOLLARS IN TAX LOSSES IF THIS

00:53:32.175 --> 00:53:34.311
BILL PASSES. SO THAT CREATES A

00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:36.413
BUDGET ISSUE THAT WE HAVE- AS

00:53:36.479 --> 00:53:38.148
WELL. I JUST THINK THAT WE

00:53:38.214 --> 00:53:40.050
COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY- INSTEAD

00:53:40.116 --> 00:53:41.318
OF BANNING OR DECIMATED AN

SMUGGLING DEVICES USED IN

SCHOOLS- ALSO THUMB DRIVES FOR

00:56:51.741 --> 00:56:53.743
COMPUTERS MADE TO LOOK LIKE A

00:56:53.810 --> 00:56:58.948
THUMB DRIVE THAT'S ACTUALLY-

00:56:59.015 --> 00:57:02.152
FOR VAPING- I'VE HEARD FROM

00:57:02.218 --> 00:57:04.521
SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT USED TO-

00:57:04.587 --> 00:57:06.856
SUSPEND STUDENTS WHEN THEY WERE

00:57:06.923 --> 00:57:08.124
CAUGHT WITH VAPING PRODUCTS.

00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:09.692
THEY WERE LOSING TOO MUCH

00:57:09.759 --> 00:57:12.028
EIGHTY A MONEY BECAUSE OF THE

00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:14.063
PREVALENCEIN SO STUDENTS WERE

00:57:14.130 --> 00:57:16.432
SENT TO STUDY HALLS AFTER THE

00:57:16.499 --> 00:57:18.668
EQUIPMENT WAS CONFISCATED.

00:57:18.735 --> 00:57:22.539
QUICK QUESTION IS THE USE OF

00:57:22.605 --> 00:57:26.576
VAPING MATERIAL. LEGAL FOR

00:57:26.643 --> 00:57:27.110
CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF

00:57:27.177 --> 00:57:30.446
TWENTY ONE. NO IT'S NOT LEGAL

00:57:30.513 --> 00:57:34.184
THE MARKETING TARGETS USE FROM

00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:35.485
IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS MIDDLE

00:57:35.552 --> 00:57:37.453
SCHOOL HIGH SCHOOL AGE YOUTH

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.922
MOST OF WHOM ARE TWENTY ONE

00:57:38.988 --> 00:57:40.957
YEARS OF AGE. SO IT'S AN

00:57:41.024 --> 00:57:43.326
ILLEGAL PRODUCT FOR THEM TO

00:57:43.393 --> 00:57:46.095
POSSESS ALREADY BUT THE

00:57:46.162 --> 00:57:48.398
MARKETING CONTINUES LEADING

00:57:48.464 --> 00:57:50.600
WITH THE FLAVORS TO APPEAL TO

00:57:50.667 --> 00:57:52.101
CHILDREN IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S

00:57:52.168 --> 00:57:53.736
CORRECT AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT

00:57:53.803 --> 00:57:56.639
WE'VE SEEN THROUGHOUT THE- THE

00:57:56.706 --> 00:57:58.908
HISTORY OF THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY

00:57:58.975 --> 00:57:59.742
AND HOW THEY MARKET TO YOUTH

00:57:59.809 --> 00:58:01.678
AND- A- AND A X. TWO OF THE

00:58:01.744 --> 00:58:03.646
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IN THEIR

00:58:03.713 --> 00:58:05.081
FLAVORED TOBACCO IS EVEN BY

00:58:05.148 --> 00:58:06.749
OFFERING AT A LOWER PRICE IN

00:58:06.816 --> 00:58:08.384
THOSE COMMUNITIES SO IT'S MORE

00:58:08.451 --> 00:58:08.952
ATTRACTIVE FOR THEM TO THEN

00:58:09.018 --> 00:58:11.988
BECOME ADDICTED- I DON'T THINK

00:58:12.055 --> 00:58:13.456
WE WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THOSE

00:58:13.523 --> 00:58:17.527
WHO- USED. FOR TASTE I MEAN I

00:58:17.594 --> 00:58:19.429
TRY TO FIGURE OUT I THINK I WAS

00:58:19.495 --> 00:58:20.930
THIRTEEN AND NOTHING TASTED SO

00:58:20.997 --> 00:58:21.664
BAD I NEVER PICKED UP ANOTHER

00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:23.600
ONE. BUT HAD IT TASTED LIKE

00:58:23.666 --> 00:58:25.735
BUBBLE GUM OR SEX ON THE BEACH

00:58:25.802 --> 00:58:27.437
AND WITH THAT TASTES LIKE BUT

00:58:27.503 --> 00:58:30.506
IT- IT COULD BE VERY ATTRACTIVE

00:58:30.573 --> 00:58:33.643
TO SOMEONE- SO HITS- I AND I

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:34.377
THINK THAT'S WHAT WE FIND WITH

00:58:34.444 --> 00:58:36.045
THE YOUTH MARKET IS THE FLAVOR

00:58:36.112 --> 00:58:37.780
BECOMES ATTRACTIVE IN THE NAMES

00:58:37.847 --> 00:58:40.016
MAKE IT. MORE ENTICING AND THEN

00:58:40.083 --> 00:58:42.285
THEY BECOME ADDICTED AND IS IT

00:58:42.352 --> 00:58:44.320
ACCURATE TO SUGGEST THAT. YOUNG

00:58:44.387 --> 00:58:47.257
PEOPLE WHO TAKE UP VAPING WITH

00:58:47.323 --> 00:58:48.958

00:59:00.103 --> 00:59:02.405
PRODUCT. AND THEN AFTER THE

00:59:02.472 --> 00:59:05.441
WHAT WE FIND IS THAT ONCE THEY

00:59:05.508 --> 00:59:07.176
BECOME ADDICTED THEN IT DOESN'T

00:59:07.243 --> 00:59:08.611
MATTER WHAT THE FLAVOR IS THEY

00:59:08.678 --> 00:59:10.246
NEED THE FIX AND THEY NEED THE

00:59:10.313 --> 00:59:12.348
NICOTINE. AND THEY DON'T BEST

00:59:12.415 --> 00:59:15.084

00:59:15.151 --> 00:59:15.652
EIGHTEEN AND OTHER PRODUCTS

00:59:15.718 --> 00:59:16.452

PROBLEM. WITH ALCOHOL SALES.

01:02:00.283 --> 01:02:01.284
AND THAT'S WHY WE FELT THAT IT

01:02:01.350 --> 01:02:02.885
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO APPLY

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:04.854
THAT SAME REQUIREMENT. TO

DECIMATES A LOT OF- BUSINESSES

01:02:13.029 --> 01:02:14.997
IT READ AND IT OBVIOUSLY IS A

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:17.967
CULTURAL ISSUE. AS WELL- AND-

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:20.236
IT OBVIOUSLY IS VERY IMPACTFUL

01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:21.137
TO A CERTAIN PARTICULAR

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:22.338
CULTURE. AND THAT IT ALSO

01:02:22.405 --> 01:02:24.707
DECIMATES THE KNOWN- THE ONLY

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:26.576
TAX REVENUE FOR THE STATE. BUT

01:02:26.642 --> 01:02:27.577
THERE HAS TO BE ANOTHER WAY

01:02:27.643 --> 01:02:29.045
THAT WE CAN DEAL WITH THIS

01:02:29.112 --> 01:02:29.612
ISSUE OF STUDENTS GETTING A

01:02:29.679 --> 01:02:31.781
HOLD OF THIS PRODUCT- WITHOUT

01:07:49.465 --> 01:07:52.735
JUST BECOME. EVEN MORE ACUTE.

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:53.936
AND SENATE BILL EIGHT FIFTY

01:07:54.003 --> 01:07:56.338
FIVE- DOES JUST A COUPLE OF

01:07:56.405 --> 01:07:58.874
VERY BASIC THINGS. FIRST OF ALL

01:07:58.941 --> 01:08:02.344
IT MAKES CLEAR. THAT INSURANCE

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:04.780
MUST COVER ALL MEDICALLY

01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:07.917
NECESSARY ADDICTION AND MENTAL

01:08:07.983 --> 01:08:10.553
HEALTH CARE NOT JUST A SUBSET

01:08:10.619 --> 01:08:12.455
THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA MENTAL

01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:14.190
HEALTH PARITY ACT FROM THE LATE

01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:15.724
NINETEEN NINETIES WAS A BIG

01:08:15.791 --> 01:08:18.828
STEP BUT IT'S LIMITED TO ONLY

01:08:18.894 --> 01:08:21.931
NINE. MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS

01:08:21.997 --> 01:08:23.933
IT DOES NOT COVER SUBSTANCE USE

01:08:23.999 --> 01:08:27.536
DISORDER. AND IT LEAVES OUT

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:31.340
SOME REALLY SIGNIFICANCE- THE

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:33.809
RELEASE A SIGNIFICANT- MENTAL

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:34.910

USE DISORDER ALCOHOL USE

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:42.117
DISORDER STIMULANT DISORDER

01:08:42.184 --> 01:08:44.720
BINGE EATING DISORDER AND MAJOR

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:46.722
NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDER DUE TO

01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:49.825
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY THOSE

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:50.392
ARE JUST EXAMPLES OF WHAT IT

01:08:50.459 --> 01:08:51.994
LEAVES OUT. AND RIGHT NOW WE

01:08:52.061 --> 01:08:53.262
KNOW THAT TOO MANY INSURANCE

01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:54.697
COMPANIES WILL ONLY COVER

01:08:54.763 --> 01:08:55.598
MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION

01:08:55.664 --> 01:08:57.600
CARE. IF YOU ARE ALREADY IN

YOUR HOUSING. AND THEN YOU GET

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:08.410
TREATMENT ARE YOU ONLY GET A

01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:10.145
FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

01:09:10.212 --> 01:09:12.448
UNTIL YOU STABILIZE. THIS IS

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:14.984
REALLY SIMILAR TO SAYING WE

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:16.886
KNOW YOU HAVE STAGE ONE CANCER.

01:09:16.952 --> 01:09:18.854
IT'S NOT SERIOUS ENOUGH YET.

COME BACK AND SEE US FOR

01:09:20.089 --> 01:09:21.557
COVERAGE WHEN YOU'RE AT STAGE

01:09:21.624 --> 01:09:23.859
FOR WE WOULD LAUGH. THE

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:24.627
INSURANCE COMPANY OUT OF THE

01:09:24.693 --> 01:09:27.196
ROOM NO ONE. WOULD ACCEPT THAT

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:27.796
AND YET WE HAVE BEEN ACCEPTING

01:09:27.863 --> 01:09:29.765

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:32.334
ADDICTION. AND IT'S NOT OKAY

01:09:32.401 --> 01:09:33.202
AND WE SEE IT PLAY OUT ON OUR

01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:36.705
STREETS. AND WE SEE IT PLAY OUT.

01:09:36.772 --> 01:09:38.541
WHO HAVE HOUSING BUT ARE

01:09:38.607 --> 01:09:40.509
SUFFERING QUIETLY. AND THEIR

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:43.913
FAMILIES ARE SUFFERING QUIETLY.

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:46.549
WE HAVE TO CHANGE THIS AND NOW

01:09:46.615 --> 01:09:49.251
IS THE TIME TO DO IT. I WANT TO

01:09:49.318 --> 01:09:50.686
KNOW THAT THE TO BOURBON

01:09:50.753 --> 01:09:52.588
ALCESTE WAS VERY THOROUGH

01:09:52.655 --> 01:09:54.723
APPROACH TO THIS BILL SHOWS

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:55.558
THAT THIS WILL HAVE A MINIMAL

01:09:55.624 --> 01:09:58.627
IMPACT. ON PREMIUMS BUT IT WILL

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:03.365
EXPAND ACCESS TO CARE. AND WITH

01:10:03.432 --> 01:10:04.733
RESPECT TO COVER NINETEEN I

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.036
JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY SAYING

01:10:07.102 --> 01:10:09.138
REPORT CAME OUT THE OTHER DAY.

01:10:09.204 --> 01:10:12.207

OVER PEOPLE'S HEADS A LITTLE

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:41.962

02:12:40.619 --> 02:12:42.454
STRUGGLING RGHT BUT I FEEL

02:12:42.521 --> 02:12:45.290
LIKE THE SAME ARGUMENT CAN BE

02:12:45.357 --> 02:12:46.925

OUTAGES ACCORDING TO FEDERAL

02:42:37.981 --> 02:42:39.683

TO SIX. HOURS AND THIS IS

02:43:35.839 --> 02:43:37.674
SIMPLY INSUFFICIENT SO THIS

02:43:37.741 --> 02:43:39.075
WEEK'S. IS A RECIPE FOR

02:43:39.142 --> 02:43:40.744

TWELVE AU SEVEN. INSTEAD

02:43:53.323 --> 02:43:54.925
REQUIRES CALIFORNIA SKILLED

02:43:54.991 --> 02:43:56.927
NURSING FACILITIES TO HAVE

02:43:56.993 --> 02:43:58.728

DURING ANY TYPE OF POWER

02:44:09.239 --> 02:44:11.608
OUTAGE. THIS BILL WHY NINETY

02:44:11.675 --> 02:44:12.909
SIX HOURS IT CONFORMS STATE

02:44:12.976 --> 02:44:15.278

REQUIREMENTS WHILE ALLOWING FOR

02:44:17.614 --> 02:44:19.449
FLEXIBILITY IN THE EVENT THAT

02:44:19.516 --> 02:44:21.551
MORE PROTECTIVE REGULATIONS OR

02:44:21.618 --> 02:44:23.386
RULES ARE ADOPTED LATER BY

02:44:23.453 --> 02:44:24.888
EITHER THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL

02:44:24.955 --> 02:44:27.090
GOVERNMENT. NOW WE KNOW THAT

02:44:27.157 --> 02:44:28.525
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN

02:44:28.592 --> 02:44:31.261
REDUCING A LOT OF. ITS

02:44:31.328 --> 02:44:33.330
REGULATIONS WE WANT TO MAKE

02:44:33.396 --> 02:44:34.698
SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN

02:44:34.764 --> 02:44:37.467
HERE AND SO LONG AS THEY ARE IN

02:44:37.534 --> 02:44:39.402
FACT TO BE IMPLEMENTED ON THE

02:44:39.469 --> 02:44:40.971
FEDERAL LEVEL WHICH WE BELIEVE

02:44:41.037 --> 02:44:42.739
THEY ARE THE STATE OF

02:44:42.806 --> 02:44:44.407
CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE TO

CONFORM TO THOSE REGULATIONS.

02:44:46.509 --> 02:44:49.246

IMPOSSIBLE DURING ONE OF THESE

02:44:57.187 --> 02:44:59.256
INCIDENTS. SO IF THAT IS THE

02:44:59.322 --> 02:45:01.024
REASON WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE

02:45:01.091 --> 02:45:03.994
AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO

02:45:04.060 --> 02:45:07.097
