00:36:03.895 --> 00:36:06.531
LEARNS. AND WHAT THEY RETAIN

00:36:06.597 --> 00:36:08.266
AND HOW TO TEST SO IT'S KIND OF

00:36:08.332 --> 00:36:10.601
A MULTIPLICITY OF PROBLEMS. AND

00:36:10.668 --> 00:36:11.602
EVEN EVEN TAKE INTO

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:12.370
CONSIDERATION WHEN YOU TAKE A

00:36:12.436 --> 00:36:14.338
LOOK AT QUIET SPACE FOR A KID

00:36:14.405 --> 00:36:16.507
TO LEARN IN A COMPUTER DOESN'T

00:36:16.574 --> 00:36:17.341
BECOMING UP BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO

00:36:17.408 --> 00:36:19.010
HAVE HEADSETS. IT'S A NUMBER

00:36:19.076 --> 00:36:20.211
IT'S A NUMBER OF ISSUES HAVE

00:36:20.278 --> 00:36:21.479
BECOME VERY VERY DIFFICULT

00:36:21.546 --> 00:36:23.548
TOUGH. TO NAVIGATE. AND THEN

00:36:23.614 --> 00:36:24.282
WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT INCOME

00:36:24.348 --> 00:36:25.783
CALL INCOME INEQUALITY ACROSS

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:27.685
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

00:36:27.752 --> 00:36:28.786
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT DISTRICTS I

00:36:28.853 --> 00:36:31.422
REPRESENT- LIKE THE ONES

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:32.857

00:36:34.158 --> 00:36:36.861
ARE THE LIKE- THEY'RE SERIOUS.

00:36:36.928 --> 00:36:38.796
INCOME INEQUALITY ISSUES THAT

00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:39.430

00:36:39.497 --> 00:36:43.134
EXACERBATED DURING COLDER THE

EDUCATE KIDS AND GENERATIONS OF

00:36:47.271 --> 00:36:49.206
THE POTENTIALLY BIT LEFT BEHIND

00:36:49.273 --> 00:36:50.374
OTHER RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE

00:36:50.441 --> 00:36:52.710
BEAR NOW. I SAY THIS BECAUSE IT

00:36:52.777 --> 00:36:54.111
DIDN'T TAKE A REPORT AND TAKE A

00:36:54.178 --> 00:36:55.947
STUDY DIDN'T TAKE A NEWS

NEIGHBORHOODS ARE WILL RIDE AT

00:37:00.918 --> 00:37:04.188

PEOPLE. WHO ARE WHO ARE

00:37:12.697 --> 00:37:14.699
STRUGGLING BEFORE. AND WHILE

00:37:14.765 --> 00:37:15.299
WE'RE DOING OUR VERY BEST I

00:37:15.366 --> 00:37:16.500
THINK IT'S TAKE IT AT LEAST FOR

00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:19.303
ME IT'S IMPORTANT KNOWLEDGE-

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:21.005
THAT EVERYTHING IS NOT ROSY.

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:22.173
EVERYTHING'S NOT PERFECT BUT

00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:24.775
THERE ARE SERIOUS PROBLEMS-

00:37:24.842 --> 00:37:26.010
THERE ARE SERIOUS PROBLEMS IN

00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:28.112
OUR IT IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM

00:37:28.179 --> 00:37:29.480
AND IN THE DISTANCE LEARNING.

00:37:29.547 --> 00:37:30.481
AND WE'VE GOT TO BEGIN TO TALK

00:37:30.548 --> 00:37:31.983
ABOUT THOSE PRESENT PROBLEMS

00:37:32.049 --> 00:37:33.417
IMMEDIATELY AND BEGIN TO TALK

00:37:33.484 --> 00:37:35.553
ABOUT WHAT WE DO- ONCE RATHER

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:36.721
THIS PANDEMIC SOME PEOPLE TALK

00:37:36.787 --> 00:37:38.389
ABOUT GO BACK TO THE NORM. BUT

00:37:38.456 --> 00:37:39.690
THE BUT THE THAN THE NORMAL IS

00:37:39.757 --> 00:37:41.025
NOT WORKING FOR PEOPLE. AND

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:42.760
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE POOR AN

00:37:42.827 --> 00:37:44.629
INCREASE IN INCOME INEQUALITY

00:37:44.695 --> 00:37:46.197
HIT YOU THE HARDEST. THE TICKET

00:37:46.263 --> 00:37:47.665
IS PANDEMIC AN ESSENTIAL

00:37:47.732 --> 00:37:48.399
WORKERS ARE STILL GOING OUT TO

00:37:48.466 --> 00:37:52.203
WORK. NOT UNIQUE TO MY DISTRICT.

00:37:52.269 --> 00:37:54.238
IT'S SURPRISING TO SOME THAT

00:37:54.305 --> 00:37:55.473
FOLKS WILL HAVE TO LEAVE THEIR

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:57.341
HOMES TO GO TO WORK AND THAT

00:37:57.408 --> 00:37:58.643
THE BUSES ARE STILL BEING USED

00:37:58.709 --> 00:38:00.378
AT THE METRO STILL BEING USED

00:38:00.444 --> 00:38:01.278
BECAUSE OF YOUR POOREST

00:38:01.345 --> 00:38:02.213
CHILDREN YOU DIDN'T HAVE A CAR

00:38:02.279 --> 00:38:04.081
BEFORE YOU CAN GET A CAR DURING

00:38:04.148 --> 00:38:07.251
THE PANDEMIC. A STRUGGLE BEFORE

00:38:07.318 --> 00:38:07.852
YOU STILL HAVE TO STRUGGLE YOU

00:38:07.918 --> 00:38:11.155
STILL HAVE TO WORK. SO I THINK.

00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:12.757
THOSE WHO HAVE COME HERE TODAY

00:38:12.823 --> 00:38:14.592

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:17.528
NARAL- THE SENATE NARAL ISSUE

00:38:17.595 --> 00:38:18.763
BUT INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ISSUE

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:20.097
AS IT RELATES TO EDUCATE OUR

00:38:20.164 --> 00:38:22.299
KIDS EDUCATING OUR KIDS- AND

00:38:22.366 --> 00:38:24.402
THE DIGITAL DIVIDE NO ONE HAND

00:38:24.468 --> 00:38:25.002

TAKING THE LEAD ON THIS HEARING

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.814
IN CALLING ME UP AND SAY HEY

00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:38.282
COULD WE- WE HAVE A JOINT

00:38:38.349 --> 00:38:39.784
HEARING ON THIS VERY VERY

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.787
IMPORTANT TOPIC. WE'RE HERE

00:38:42.853 --> 00:38:44.488
TODAY WITH A NARROW FOCUS. TO

00:38:44.555 --> 00:38:47.358
EXAMINE STUDENTS ACCESS TO THE

00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:49.360
INTERNET. IN THIS NEW ERA OF

00:38:49.427 --> 00:38:50.661
DISTANCE LEARNING. NOT

00:38:50.728 --> 00:38:52.463
NECESSARILY TO DISCUSS THE

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:53.898
EFFICACY OF DISTANCE LEARNING

00:38:53.964 --> 00:38:55.666
BECAUSE WE KNOW IT'S LIMITED. I

00:38:55.733 --> 00:38:58.169
HAVE TWO KIDS I'M A TEACHER.

00:38:58.235 --> 00:39:00.938
DISTANCE LEARNING IS NOT. IN

00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:02.540
CLASSROOM LEARNING I THINK WE

00:39:02.606 --> 00:39:04.341
ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE WANT

00:39:04.408 --> 00:39:05.776
OUR KIDS BACK IN THE CLASSROOM

00:39:05.843 --> 00:39:07.745
BUT TO I THINK THAT THIS MAY

00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:08.913
ALTER THE WAY KIDS LEARN GOING

00:39:08.979 --> 00:39:10.514
FORWARD TO SOME EXTENT TO WHERE

00:39:10.581 --> 00:39:11.916
THEY WILL DO DISTANCE LEARNING

00:39:11.982 --> 00:39:13.117
AND IN CLASSROOM LEARNING

00:39:13.184 --> 00:39:13.918
MEANING. YOU KNOW POST

00:39:13.984 --> 00:39:15.352
CLASSROOM EXPERIENCE WILL BE

00:39:15.419 --> 00:39:16.987
MORE LEARNING TAKING PLACE ON

00:39:17.054 --> 00:39:19.090
ON THE COMPUTER AFTER THE

00:39:19.156 --> 00:39:20.057
STANDARD SCHOOL THEY IN THE

00:39:20.124 --> 00:39:21.792
FUTURE. AND I REPRESENT A

00:39:21.859 --> 00:39:23.561
DISTRICT THAT'S VERY URBAN IN

00:39:23.627 --> 00:39:25.296
NATURE BUT ALSO A VERY RURAL

00:39:25.362 --> 00:39:26.931
HAVE CATALINA ISLAND THEY HAVE

00:39:26.997 --> 00:39:28.666
UNLIMITED INTERNET ACCESS ON

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:30.835
CATALINA ISLAND. THERE'S KIDS

00:39:30.901 --> 00:39:32.036
THAT LIVE ON CATALINA. GIVES

00:39:32.103 --> 00:39:34.138
THE NEED TO LEARN AND- SO THIS

00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:35.873
IS VERY IMPACTFUL TO MY

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.508
DISTRICT AND I HOPE OUR HEARING

00:39:37.575 --> 00:39:38.876
TODAY WILL FOCUS ON SOLUTIONS

00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:40.244

ACKNOWLEDGE. THERE IS A PROBLEM

00:39:46.517 --> 00:39:50.020

TO CONNECTIVITY ARE NOT ALWAYS

00:41:51.909 --> 00:41:53.677
SIMPLE OR STRAIGHTFORWARD.

00:41:53.744 --> 00:41:54.745
THERE ARE MANY ISSUES TO

MOSTLY TO SPEED I THINK THERE

00:42:24.174 --> 00:42:26.944
ORIGINALLY WAS MONEY IN IT. BUT

00:42:27.011 --> 00:42:27.511
THEN WAS PULLED OUT FOR SOME

00:42:27.578 --> 00:42:31.015
REASON SIMILAR AGAR CURRY HAD

00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:32.349

00:42:32.416 --> 00:42:34.952
MONEY AND ACCESS. AND IN ONE

00:42:35.019 --> 00:42:36.854

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. BUT WE

00:42:44.795 --> 00:42:46.864
NEED TO IDENTIFY AN ONGOING

00:42:46.931 --> 00:42:49.600
SOURCE TO SUPPORT CONNECTIVITY

00:42:49.667 --> 00:42:51.602

00:43:26.103 --> 00:43:27.671
THE WORK THAT LAUNCHED MY

00:43:27.738 --> 00:43:29.807
CAREER IN PUBLIC POLICY AND MY

00:43:29.873 --> 00:43:31.108
OWN CHILDREN SCHOOL DISTRICT

00:43:31.175 --> 00:43:33.077
TWELVE YEARS AGO WE REALIZED WE

00:43:33.143 --> 00:43:34.645
HAD A SIGNIFICANT FUNDING GAP

00:43:34.712 --> 00:43:36.280
NOT ONLY IN THE ACCESS BUT

00:43:36.347 --> 00:43:38.415
SIMPLY THE HARDWARE IN ORDER TO

00:43:38.482 --> 00:43:39.550
INVEST TO MAKE OUR SCHOOL

00:43:39.616 --> 00:43:41.585
DISTRICT HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY

00:43:41.652 --> 00:43:42.853
THAT IT NEEDED JUST TO MEET

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.555
STATE STANDARDS AT THE TIME AND

00:43:44.621 --> 00:43:46.190
THAT WAS FIBER OPTICS FROM THE

00:43:46.256 --> 00:43:48.225
STREET INTO THE CLASSROOM. THAT

00:43:48.292 --> 00:43:49.626
WAS ENOUGH EQUIPMENT FOR EVERY

00:43:49.693 --> 00:43:50.894
CHILD TO HAVE SOME KIND OF

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:52.696
ACCESS DURING THEIR SCHOOL DAY

00:43:52.763 --> 00:43:54.431
AND DURING THEIR SCHOOL WEEK

00:43:54.498 --> 00:43:55.666
AND AS WE HAVE FOUND SADLY

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:57.701
DURING THIS CRISIS THAT THOSE

00:43:57.768 --> 00:44:00.070
FRACTURES IN THE HAVES AND THE

00:44:00.137 --> 00:44:01.105
HAVE NOTS IN OUR SYSTEM HAVE

00:44:01.171 --> 00:44:03.774
BEEN LAID STARKLY BARE AND AS

00:44:03.841 --> 00:44:05.809
E GO THROUGH THIS- TO GERMINAL

00:44:05.876 --> 00:44:07.811
DONALD'S POINT WE MUST REMEMBER

00:44:07.878 --> 00:44:08.812
THAT THERE WERE DISTRICTS

00:44:08.879 --> 00:44:10.681
ALREADY IN THIS STATE THAT

00:44:10.748 --> 00:44:13.617
DIDN'T HAVE EVEN ACCESS PERIOD

00:44:13.684 --> 00:44:15.052
TO THE INTERNET WE STILL HAD

00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:16.453
SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.821
THE STATE WITH NO INTERNET

00:44:17.888 --> 00:44:19.490
ACCESS LET ALONE THOSE STUDENTS

00:44:19.556 --> 00:44:21.392
AND FAMILIES HAVING ACCESS. IN

00:44:21.458 --> 00:44:23.293
THEIR HOMES SO THE URGENCY

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.261
GIVEN THE MOMENT OF THE CODE

00:44:24.328 --> 00:44:26.163

00:44:29.166 --> 00:44:30.834
VERY EXPANSIVELY AND LOOK TO

00:44:30.901 --> 00:44:32.803

THAT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IS.

00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:37.988
OVER A DECADE AGO TEN FIFTEEN

00:47:38.055 --> 00:47:39.756
YEARS AGO SOME SCHOOL STARTED

00:47:39.823 --> 00:47:41.225
FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS STARTED

00:47:41.291 --> 00:47:43.594
INVESTING. AND NOT ONLY

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:45.996
INTERNET BUT DEVICES IPADS SO

00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:48.699
FOR. IT WAS VERY CLEAR TO ME AS

00:47:48.765 --> 00:47:50.734
A CLASSROOM TEACHER EVEN WITHIN

00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:53.937
A DISTRICT. THAT WAS INVESTING

00:47:54.004 --> 00:47:54.571
THERE ARE THERE WERE

00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:57.341
INEQUITIES. MEANING THAT SOME

00:47:57.407 --> 00:47:59.476
KIDS NOT ONLY HAD ACCESS TO

00:47:59.543 --> 00:48:02.946
IPADS- ALL TYPES OF DEVICES IN

THE CLASSROOM BUT ALSO AT HOME.

00:48:06.183 --> 00:48:07.851
IF YOU JUMP AHEAD NOW TO WHERE

00:48:07.918 --> 00:48:09.586
WE ARE THAT STILL EXISTS SO

00:48:09.653 --> 00:48:11.822
THIS HAS JUST MADE IT VERY

00:48:11.888 --> 00:48:14.124
CLEAR WHAT WE CAN ALREADY SEE

00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:15.259
WHICH DEPENDING ON THE DISTRICT

00:48:15.325 --> 00:48:17.394
YOU WERE SENDING YOUR CHILD TO

00:48:17.461 --> 00:48:19.863
OR THE SCHOOL. THAT YOUR CHILD

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:22.266
ATTENDED A COULD BE THE SAME A

00:48:22.332 --> 00:48:24.167
SCHOOL WITHIN A DISTRICT YOU

00:48:24.234 --> 00:48:26.203
COULD HAVE VERY DIFFERENT.

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:29.439
EXPERIENCES WITH NOT ONLY-

00:48:29.506 --> 00:48:32.342
USING COMPUTERS UP BEING TRAIN

00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:33.477
SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS WERE

00:48:33.543 --> 00:48:35.846
GIVING ACCESS TO A FOUR YEAR

00:48:35.912 --> 00:48:38.015
OLD PRE K. NOT ONLY ON

00:48:38.081 --> 00:48:39.583
KEYBOARDING BUT ALL THE

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.285
EXPERIENCES- THAT YOU WOULD

00:48:41.351 --> 00:48:43.220
LIKE TO SEE YOUR CHILD. AND

00:48:43.287 --> 00:48:45.489
THEN A VERY SUCCINCT PROGRAM

00:48:45.555 --> 00:48:47.591
FROM KINDERGARTEN ALL THE WAY

00:48:47.658 --> 00:48:50.260
THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE OTHERS

00:48:50.327 --> 00:48:53.263
AHEAD NO DEVICES IN HIGH SCHOOL

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:56.133
MAYBE A FEW OF THE COURSES OR

00:48:56.199 --> 00:48:58.902
EXPERIENCES. BUT WE SAW THE

00:48:58.969 --> 00:49:00.470
INEQUITIES WITH THE LOCAL

IF THERE'S TWO OR THREE DEVICES

00:49:20.457 --> 00:49:22.859
WHAT'S EVEN DEEPER THAN THAT IS

00:49:22.926 --> 00:49:24.194
WHAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE ARE

00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:26.663

THEIR OWN JOB. SOME OF FAMILIES

00:49:37.674 --> 00:49:39.242
I HAVE NO ONE AT HOME MAYBE AN

00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:41.545
OLDER BROTHER OR SISTER- THAT

00:49:41.611 --> 00:49:43.447

NUMBER ONE HIS EMPHASIS ON THE

00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:04.581
IMPORTANCE OF RETURNING THE IN

00:53:04.648 --> 00:53:05.115
CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION AND

00:53:05.181 --> 00:53:09.152
NUMBER TWO. HIS POINT THAT. THE

00:53:09.219 --> 00:53:10.620
TOOLS OF DISTANCE LEARNING CAN

00:53:10.687 --> 00:53:12.188
BE VALUABLE NOT ONLY IN

00:53:12.255 --> 00:53:13.924
REPLACING IN CLASSROOM LEARNING

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:16.126
BUT ALSO IN COMPLEMENTING AND

00:53:16.192 --> 00:53:17.427

HAVE PROVEN VERY EFFECTIVE AND

00:53:21.965 --> 00:53:23.600
SO THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE

00:53:23.667 --> 00:53:26.236
TO ASSURE UNIVERSAL ACCESS. AND

00:53:26.303 --> 00:53:27.871

OUR COLLECTIVE CAPACITY IN OUR

00:53:30.941 --> 00:53:33.510
INFRASTRUCTURE I THINK HAS THE

00:53:33.577 --> 00:53:35.812
POTENTIAL TO PAY DIVIDENDS. IN

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:38.114
THE LONG TERM. AND ALSO THE

00:53:38.181 --> 00:53:39.416
WORK THAT IS BEING DONE THAT

00:53:39.482 --> 00:53:40.317
WE'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT TODAY

00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:42.052
BASED UPON THE MATERIALS IS

00:53:42.118 --> 00:53:44.020
GENUINELY GOOD WORK. THAT IS

00:53:44.087 --> 00:53:45.989
HELPING TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

00:53:46.056 --> 00:53:48.592
INEQUITIES- THE SITUATION IS

00:53:48.658 --> 00:53:49.326
CREATED BUT I WANT TO

00:53:49.392 --> 00:53:51.561
EMPHASIZE. THAT IT IS THE ONLY

00:53:51.628 --> 00:53:54.030
SMOOTHING OUT THE EDGES OF THE

00:53:54.097 --> 00:53:56.066
OUTER EDGES OF THE PROBLEM. AND

00:53:56.132 --> 00:53:58.034
THAT A SCHOOL SHUTDOWN IS

00:53:58.101 --> 00:54:00.370
INHERENTLY INEQUITABLE IT

00:54:00.437 --> 00:54:01.972
INHERENTLY WHY DIDN'T THE

00:54:02.038 --> 00:54:04.240
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS THAT EXIST IN

00:54:04.307 --> 00:54:07.677
OUR- PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM.

00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:09.746
AND IT'S DOING ENORMOUS HARM TO

00:54:09.813 --> 00:54:12.148
ALL CALIFORNIA KIDS AND ALL

00:54:12.215 --> 00:54:14.184
CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. THE

00:54:14.250 --> 00:54:15.785
EVIDENCE IS PELLUCIDA THE

00:54:15.852 --> 00:54:17.821
CLEAR. BEYOND ANY REASONABLE

00:54:17.887 --> 00:54:20.957
DEBATE. THE HARMS BEING DONE BY

00:54:21.024 --> 00:54:22.959
KEEPING KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL FAR

00:54:23.026 --> 00:54:25.395
EXCEED THE RISKS OF CONTRACTING

00:54:25.462 --> 00:54:29.232
THIS VIRUS. MOREOVER DOCTOR

00:54:29.299 --> 00:54:31.601
GALLEY RECENTLY SAID THAT THERE

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:34.037
IS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY LINK

00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:35.805
BETWEEN INCREASED TRANSMISSION

00:54:35.872 --> 00:54:37.374
AND SCHOOL RE OPENINGS WHERE

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.709
THEY HAVE OCCURRED. AND THAT IS

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:41.311
WHAT THE EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN ALL

00:54:41.378 --> 00:54:44.280
ALONG AS WELL. THE STATE SHOULD

00:54:44.347 --> 00:54:46.549
BE DOING EVERYTHING IT CAN. TO

00:54:46.616 --> 00:54:48.251
GET EVERY SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA

BACK OPEN AS QUICKLY AS

00:54:49.753 --> 00:54:50.754

SEEING QUITE THE OPPOSITE.

00:54:52.622 --> 00:54:53.757
WE'RE SEEING THE STATE AID IN

00:54:53.823 --> 00:54:55.759
THE BED THOSE WOULD USE SCHOOL

00:54:55.825 --> 00:54:57.894
CLOSURES FOR POLITICAL PURPOSES

00:54:57.961 --> 00:54:58.662
WE'RE SEEING NEW REASONS

00:54:58.728 --> 00:55:00.296
INVENTED. TO KEEP SCHOOLS

SHOULD NOT. BECAUSE WE DON'T

00:55:09.039 --> 00:55:11.074
WANT ANYONE TO GET A HEAD START.

00:55:11.141 --> 00:55:13.209
THAT IS A MONSTROUS SENTIMENT

00:55:13.276 --> 00:55:14.444
AND IT'S DOING INCALCULABLE

00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:16.246
HARM. TO MILLIONS OF KIDS

00:55:16.312 --> 00:55:16.880

THAT WE DO KNOW ABOUT. ISSUES

00:56:52.542 --> 00:56:53.576
RELATED TO MORE SPECIFICALLY

00:56:53.643 --> 00:56:56.045

VERY VERY KIND OF IT REALLY

00:56:58.348 --> 00:57:01.885
WASN'T. IF I COULD. WITH BUT

00:57:01.951 --> 00:57:05.555

MEMBERS OUR TO TALK ABOUT TWO

00:57:09.125 --> 00:57:11.628
DIFFERENT ISSUES WHY IS.

00:57:11.694 --> 00:57:13.196
WHETHER THERE'S A PHYSICAL IN.

00:57:13.263 --> 00:57:15.331
BUT FOR A PROPERTY INTERNET

00:57:15.398 --> 00:57:17.066
ACCESS AND IN FACT WHETHER OR

00:57:17.133 --> 00:57:20.503
NOT A BEING A IN THE HOUSE. ON

00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:22.472
TOPICS WE FOR TALK ABOUT.

00:57:22.539 --> 00:57:26.176
ACTORS WERE AVAILABILITY CAL.

00:57:26.242 --> 00:57:28.144
I'M IN SEASON THREE WITH THAT

00:57:28.211 --> 00:57:30.413
THE TABLE HAVE HERE STATEWIDE

00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.081
97% OF CALIFORNIA HOUSEHOLDS

00:57:32.148 --> 00:57:35.251
HOW BROADBAND OF THE TO THE

00:57:35.318 --> 00:57:37.620
THAT'S THE- I THINK MEGABIT PER

00:57:37.687 --> 00:57:40.690
SUCH DOWNLOADS. I THE SENATOR

00:57:40.757 --> 00:57:41.291
THE STATE OF QATAR CORRECT CAL

00:57:41.357 --> 00:57:44.327
PROBABLY COMMISSION USES AND WE

00:57:44.394 --> 00:57:45.195
DO HAVE SOME INFORMATION ON A

00:57:45.261 --> 00:57:46.429
HIGHER SPEED THERE YOU CAN SEE

00:57:46.496 --> 00:57:48.164
IN TERMS STATEWIDE ACCESS IT

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:50.767
DOESN'T CHANGE MUCH WOULD BE.

00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:52.068
97% VERSUS NINETY SIX PERCENT-

00:57:52.135 --> 00:57:55.505
ACTOR- YOU COULD SEE IN URBAN

00:57:55.572 --> 00:57:56.906
AREAS THAT THE- LOCAL PHARMACY

00:57:56.973 --> 00:57:58.942
WHATEVER IT NINETY EIGHT. POINT

00:57:59.008 --> 00:58:00.610
1% ACCESS- I'M USING THAT SIX

00:58:00.677 --> 00:58:02.912
MEGABITS PER SECOND STANDARD

00:58:02.979 --> 00:58:03.947
NINETY SEVEN POINT NINE- IF

00:58:04.013 --> 00:58:05.548
YOU'RE LOOKING AT A HIGHER

00:58:05.615 --> 00:58:07.250
STANDARD. AND THIS IS SOMETHING

00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:08.251
I THINK WE BOTH THE NUMBERS

00:58:08.318 --> 00:58:09.686
HERE BECAUSE THIS IS AN AREA

00:58:09.752 --> 00:58:11.187
THAT IS INVOLVING THE FEDERAL

00:58:11.254 --> 00:58:12.956
GOVERNMENT HAVE WITHIN THE- OR

00:58:13.022 --> 00:58:14.490
ARE GIVEN THE TWO YEARS. A THE

00:58:14.557 --> 00:58:16.159
HIGH TWENTY FIVE MEGABITS PER

00:58:16.226 --> 00:58:20.129
SECOND STANDARD AND- AND SO

00:58:20.196 --> 00:58:21.197
THAT THEY ARE DIFFERENT IN KIND

00:58:21.264 --> 00:58:25.635
OF A WE SEE FROM NUMBERS FOR

00:58:25.702 --> 00:58:27.270
AREA CAL THAT WHETHER OR NOT

00:58:27.337 --> 00:58:28.872
YOU USE ONE. BRING FROM THE

00:58:28.938 --> 00:58:30.340
MATTER BUT THE ROLE IN THAT

00:58:30.406 --> 00:58:32.742
DOES CHANGE ARE SOME THEM HOW

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:34.744
MANY HEALTHY TO GO BACK SO IF

00:58:34.811 --> 00:58:52.662
YOU'RE LOOKING THE LOWER EAST.

00:58:52.729 --> 00:58:54.564
WE'LL BE DOING SECRETIVE

00:58:54.631 --> 00:58:56.532
CONSTRUCTION- YOU KNOW ON A

00:58:56.599 --> 00:58:57.867
VIDEO CONFERENCING AND MAYBE

00:58:57.934 --> 00:58:59.502
HAVING SOME WEBSITES OPEN TO

00:58:59.569 --> 00:59:01.738
LOOK UP INFORMATION. BUT IF

00:59:01.804 --> 00:59:03.373
YOU'RE STARTING TO TALK ABOUT

00:59:03.439 --> 00:59:05.408
THE TWO OR THREE. ACTIVISM

00:59:05.475 --> 00:59:06.576
HOUSEHOLD TRYING TO ACCESS THIS

00:59:06.643 --> 00:59:07.844
IS RUNNING AN ADULT WORKING

00:59:07.911 --> 00:59:09.412
FROM HOME THAT IS NO LONGER

00:59:09.479 --> 00:59:10.513
ENOUGH AND NOW YOU'RE YOU NEED

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:13.950
SOMETHING MORE LIKE THE TWENTY

00:59:14.017 --> 00:59:14.450
FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND

00:59:14.517 --> 00:59:16.586
FOUNDER ABOUT. ONE THING WE

00:59:16.653 --> 00:59:18.855
POINT OUT TO IT- ALTHOUGH THE

00:59:18.922 --> 00:59:21.557
ACCESS. OR GROUP AVAILABILITY

00:59:21.624 --> 00:59:24.160
IS A BIGGER ISSUE CAN IN ON THE

00:59:24.227 --> 00:59:26.729
WEB. IN RURAL AREAS IF YOU JUST

00:59:26.796 --> 00:59:28.965
GET TOLD. THAT ARE UNCERTAIN

00:59:29.032 --> 00:59:30.433
CAL DAMAGE OF THE ARE ACTUALLY

00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.435
URBAN AREAS AND- I MENTIONED IS

00:59:32.502 --> 00:59:33.736
NOT TO SAY THAT. WE SHOULD BUT

00:59:33.803 --> 00:59:36.172
THERE ARE. ISSUES IN OUR AREA

00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:36.906
FOR MORE PRODUCTIVE FOR MEMBERS

00:59:36.973 --> 00:59:38.675
WHO ARE IN PLACES THAT ARE

00:59:38.741 --> 00:59:40.243
PRIMARILY URBAN. YOU MIGHT

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:42.211
STILL HAVE TO. BUMP OF. THAT DO

00:59:42.278 --> 00:59:43.980
NOT ACCESS BECAUSE THEY DON'T

00:59:44.047 --> 00:59:51.454
HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE. MOVIES

00:59:51.521 --> 00:59:55.658
ARE ON. CHU RIVER CEMENT ON NOW.

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:58.895
WHAT WAS THE CALL PRODUCT. AND

00:59:58.962 --> 01:00:01.464
SO THIS IS HOW. THAT HAVE

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:03.566
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE. BETA A

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:04.834
WIRED CONNECTION OF THE CLASS

01:00:04.901 --> 01:00:09.839
WIRED INTERNET AND THEN AROUND.

01:00:09.906 --> 01:00:10.974
SIX TO. SO BASED ON THE C. P.

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:15.311
U. BIG BIG. GAP ANALYSIS. BY

01:00:15.378 --> 01:00:17.347
YEAH THE RIGHT NUMBER OF THE

01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:18.448
PERSON OF HEALTH. 80% OF THE

01:00:18.514 --> 01:00:22.518
WHO. CRITICS TO CHOOSE TO DO.

01:00:22.585 --> 01:00:27.256
THAT THAT NUMBER. DOES VERY.

01:00:27.323 --> 01:00:28.391
ACROSS THE STATE THAT THE

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:30.927
GOVERNOR ALSO PUT THE- UC. THAT

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:32.528
AT A NUMBER OF THEM A- THAT. TO

01:00:32.595 --> 01:00:34.163
GET A SENSE OF. WHAT WERE THE

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:36.833
MAIN DRIVERS OF ME FACTORS THE

01:00:36.899 --> 01:00:38.634
RESEARCH. WITH HIGHER OR LOWER.

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:40.470
ADOPTION RATES AROUND INTERNET.

01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:43.272
AND THE BONUS POINTS. ARE

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:45.074
PROBABLY TOO MANY OF THE

01:00:45.141 --> 01:00:47.777
CORRELATION. IS STRONG WITHIN.

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:50.480
SO I IN IN SAN TRACTS WHERE

01:00:50.546 --> 01:00:51.781
ABOUT THE AVERAGE ANNUAL INCOME

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:54.917
IS A- EIGHTY. DOLLARS YOU HAVE

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:55.852
IN ADOPTION RATE OF 86% WHEREAS

01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:59.455
IN. TRY WHERE. EVERY JANUARY IS

01:00:59.522 --> 01:01:00.089
TWENTY DOLLARS DOLLARS OR- YOU

01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:03.026
HAVE ENOUGH TO READ UP. THREE

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:04.827
SO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES

01:01:04.894 --> 01:01:19.542
THERE IS TALKING. OR

01:01:19.609 --> 01:01:23.012
HOUSEHOLDS- TRACKS WHERE- THERE

01:01:23.079 --> 01:01:24.580
WERE. A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF

01:01:24.647 --> 01:01:25.615
HOUSEHOLDS THAT WERE LIMITED

01:01:25.681 --> 01:01:27.550
ENGLISH SPEAKING WERE ALSO LESS

01:01:27.617 --> 01:01:28.918
LIKELY TO THE FRONT AND THEN.

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:29.752
THE DEFINITION OF LIMITED

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:31.621
ENGLISH SPEAKING HERE IS IF

01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:32.922
YOU'RE IN A HOUSEHOLD WHERE

01:01:32.989 --> 01:01:34.223
NONE OF THE ADULTS WITH THE

01:01:34.290 --> 01:01:35.792
THAT THEY SPEAK ENGLISH VERY

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:37.527
WELL. AND SO THEY GIVE YOU A

01:01:37.593 --> 01:01:40.096
COUPLE OF THAT THE DIFFERENCES

01:01:40.163 --> 01:01:42.465
THERE YEAH THERE'S A- INCLUDE A

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:43.666
HIGHER RATE OF. FROM WHICH WERE

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:44.600
NOT ACTUALLY BASED ON THE

01:01:44.667 --> 01:01:46.969
NUMBERS. THAT IT'S BECAUSE THEY

01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:48.504
CHOSE NOT TO AND THAT MIGHT BE

01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:50.373
SIGNIFICANTLY CUTS TO INCOME.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:55.845
I'M ALSO. YOU KNOW. LOOKING AT

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:56.546
THESE AT THIS INFORMATION

01:01:56.612 --> 01:01:58.181
COMPARING WITH OUR- KIDS OVER

01:01:58.247 --> 01:02:00.950
THE CASE SYSTEM. COMING FROM UP

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:01.918
THE SPECIFIC THAT THE LAW

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:03.619
CONTENT FUNDING. IS TARGETING.

01:02:03.686 --> 01:02:05.121
LOW INCOME STUDENTS ENGLISH

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:07.490
LEARNERS. BUT BASED ON THE GAP

01:02:07.557 --> 01:02:09.425
AND ALL BILLS ALSO THE WHO ARE.

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:09.992
LIKELY TO LIVE IN OUR WHERE

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:13.663
THEY MIGHT HAVE BY INTERNET.

01:02:13.729 --> 01:02:16.099
I'M ONE THING THAT WOULD HAVE

01:02:16.165 --> 01:02:18.101
GREAT BUT THE GUNS AFTER THERE

01:02:18.167 --> 01:02:20.436
WAS ANY OF. WE HAD ON. THEM

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:22.839
ACCESS IN TRIBAL INTER AREA. WE

01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:24.107
COULD NOT WE DID NOT FIND

01:02:24.173 --> 01:02:25.241
SPECIFIC OF MY ON ADULT RATES

01:02:25.308 --> 01:02:28.177
IN IN REGION BUT WE DID. THAT

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:29.779
SOME FEDERAL INFORMATION SHOWS

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:31.614
THAT THIS TWENTY FIVE MEGABITS

01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:34.784
PER SECOND. I TRY. TRIBAL AREAS

01:02:34.851 --> 01:02:35.885
HOW TO A SIX EIGHT POINT

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:38.054
PERCENT OF THE- HAVE ACCESS TO

01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:39.255
BROADBAND INTERNET SO THAT'S-

01:02:39.322 --> 01:02:41.124
VERY IN LINE WITH THE ROLE

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:43.292
NUMBER STATEWIDE. FARM WHICH IN

01:02:43.359 --> 01:02:44.427
SOME WAYS NOT SURPRISING GIVEN

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:50.199
THAT. MOST OR MANY ACTIONABLE.

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:53.569
AREAS ARE IN RURAL AREAS. SO

01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:54.971
NEXT TIME ON PAGE THREE WE HAVE

01:02:55.037 --> 01:02:56.239
A LITTLE INFORMATION. SPEAKING

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:57.573
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT GOING ON

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:59.475
FIRST TO AND SCHOOLS OF THE

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:00.510
STATE OF MIND HOW. A LOT OF

01:03:00.576 --> 01:03:02.178
GOOD SPECIFIC DATA HERE. THE

01:03:02.245 --> 01:03:03.146
DATA BECAUSE THE HAS COLLECTED

01:03:03.212 --> 01:03:04.580
HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN FOCUSED

01:03:04.647 --> 01:03:06.983
ON ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AT

01:03:07.049 --> 01:03:08.618
THE SCHOOL SITE- AND THERE ARE

01:03:08.684 --> 01:03:10.753
A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS IN PLACE-

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.755
TO EXPAND ACCESS- FOR EXAMPLE

01:03:12.822 --> 01:03:13.956
IF YEARS AGO THERE WERE THESE

01:03:14.023 --> 01:03:15.224
ARE INFRASTRUCTURE GRANTS

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:16.225
BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:18.060
GRANTS. QUICKLY TARGETED LOWER

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:19.662
AND ROTARIANS WERE THERE WAS

01:03:19.729 --> 01:03:21.898
NO- NO GOOD ACCESS TO HIGH

01:03:21.964 --> 01:03:23.866
SPEED INTERNET- IN TERMS OF

01:03:23.933 --> 01:03:25.835
WHAT'S GOING ON AT OUR STUDENTS

01:03:25.902 --> 01:03:27.670
IS HOW. IT STUDENTS IS A HOMES

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:30.006
WE HAVE NOT. HAD A LOT OF DATA

01:03:30.072 --> 01:03:31.474
ON THAT A BIGGER BIT INCREASING

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:32.708
RECOGNITION THAT STUDENTS ARE

MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB BUT A SMALLER

01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:38.133
ONE THAT WE HAD JUST SIX MONTHS

GETTING THOSE TO THE SCHOOLS IS

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.035

THAT WE'VE THAT WE'VE I

01:26:28.883 --> 01:26:30.618
CALCULATED BEFORE I THINK THAT.

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:31.619
WILL BE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT

01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:33.955
WE NEED TO LOOK INTO THAT MAKE

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:35.490

01:26:42.564 --> 01:26:44.399
SITUATION MORE LONGER TERM IN

01:26:44.465 --> 01:26:45.466
THE FUTURE WHEN WE'RE NOT.

SPECIFIC WHERE TO GAVE IT WOULD.

01:26:56.411 --> 01:26:57.712
REQUIRE A LOT OF KIND MAJOR

01:26:57.779 --> 01:26:58.980
DECISION POINTS TO FIGURE OUT

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:00.448

HOUSEHOLDS ARE EQUIPPED WITH

01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:21.369
SPEEDS ADEQUATE FOR MULTIPLE

01:27:21.436 --> 01:27:23.438

I'M HAVING IN MY DISTRICT IS

01:27:33.181 --> 01:27:35.083
THAT NOT ONE FAMILY CAN ALL BE

01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:36.718
ONLINE AT ONE TIME WITH

01:27:36.784 --> 01:27:40.154
TEMPORARY HOT SPOTS AND SO- I

01:27:40.221 --> 01:27:41.422
JUST WAS ALSO DO YOU HAVE A

01:27:41.489 --> 01:27:42.624
PERCENT OF STUDENTS THAT ARE

01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:45.693
ACTUALLY RELYING ON TEMPORARY

01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:46.160

THAT THE GAP ANALYSIS THAT I

01:27:51.666 --> 01:27:52.433
MENTIONED THAT THE PUBLIC

01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:54.702

MEGABIT PER SECOND STANDARD I

01:28:03.978 --> 01:28:05.446
THINK UNDER THAT STANDARD I

01:28:05.513 --> 01:28:07.081
THINK IT'S PROBABLY ONLY ONE

01:28:07.148 --> 01:28:08.449
STUDENT COULD BE DEFIED DOING

01:28:08.516 --> 01:28:09.450
DISTANCE LEARNING AT ONE TIME

01:28:09.517 --> 01:28:10.718
SO IF YOU HAVE A TWO OR THREE

01:28:10.785 --> 01:28:12.220
CHILDREN. ARE TRYING TO ACCESS

01:28:12.286 --> 01:28:13.621
A ONE TIME THAT'S NOT TELLING

THEM. ARE HAD SOME STATEWIDE

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:20.128
NUMBERS I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT

01:28:20.194 --> 01:28:22.630
EXTENT THEY HAD INFORMATION-

01:28:22.697 --> 01:28:24.098
ARE EASILY AVAILABLE THAT THAT

01:28:24.165 --> 01:28:25.967
BREAKS DOWN INDIVIDUAL R. OR

01:28:26.034 --> 01:28:29.771
RISK REGIONAL- VARIATION. ARE

01:28:29.837 --> 01:28:31.773
WE DO KNOW THE BASED ON THE-

01:28:31.839 --> 01:28:32.540
INFORMATION OF THE OTHER THAT

01:28:32.607 --> 01:28:33.608
WE WOULD EXPECT THAT THERE

01:28:33.675 --> 01:28:36.477
WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY- BIGGER

01:28:36.544 --> 01:28:38.446
CHALLENGES IN. LOWER INCOME

01:28:38.513 --> 01:28:40.248
AREAS IN ERIC AND-

01:28:40.314 --> 01:28:41.683
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER ADOPTION

AND- HOUSEHOLDS THAT HAVE

01:28:43.951 --> 01:28:44.952
LIMITED ENGLISH THAT HAVE

LIMITED ENGLISH SPEAKING

01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:48.356
ADULTS- AND I THINK BASED ON

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:49.257
WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT BROADBAND

01:28:49.323 --> 01:28:50.658
ACCESS IN. RURAL AREAS THERE'S

01:28:50.725 --> 01:28:58.533

THIRD OF HOUSE WHO DO NOT HAVE.

01:29:06.107 --> 01:29:06.574

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:33.134
ELECTRICITY I THINK WE'RE JUST

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:34.635
BEEN A LOT OF WORK DONE. BUT

01:29:34.702 --> 01:29:36.537
OFFICER FROM OVER HERE NOW

FRONT OF US. I LIKE THAT WE

01:29:39.006 --> 01:29:40.641
NEED TO BE CREATIVE IN FINDING.

01:29:40.708 --> 01:29:42.310
SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THIS

01:29:42.376 --> 01:29:43.211
PROBLEM I KNOW YOU TALKED

01:29:43.277 --> 01:29:45.713
ABOUT- PUTTING SOME FOLKS. TO A

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:47.849
TEST TO SEE HOW WE CAN. CLOSE

01:29:47.915 --> 01:29:49.016
THAT GAP I THINK NOW MORE THAN

01:29:49.083 --> 01:29:50.384
EVER. WE ALL NEED TO COME

01:29:50.451 --> 01:29:51.486

EVERY STUDENT IN THE STATE OF

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:54.455
CALIFORNIA. HAS ACCESS TO HIGH

01:29:54.522 --> 01:29:55.957
SPEED INTERNET. IT DOESN'T

01:29:56.023 --> 01:29:57.492
MATTER WHERE IN THE INNER CITY.

01:29:57.558 --> 01:29:59.227
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ON THE

01:29:59.293 --> 01:30:00.561
ROLE COMMUNITIES MORE THAN EVER

01:30:00.628 --> 01:30:01.963
WE NEED IT. AND HOPEFULLY WE

01:30:02.029 --> 01:30:03.464
CAN START MOVING FOR TO CLOSE

01:30:03.531 --> 01:30:05.933
THAT GAP. SOONER RATHER THAN

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:09.804
LATER THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR

01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:11.239

CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO THE OF

01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:17.779
PRESENTERS I THINK THAT AS MANY

01:30:17.845 --> 01:30:19.313
MY COLLEAGUES AND EVEN THE

01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:22.183
PRESENTATIONS INDICATE- YOU

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:25.219
KNOW THAT THIS. REPRESENTS

01:30:25.286 --> 01:30:27.588
INEQUITIES AS COVERT HAS DONE

01:30:27.655 --> 01:30:29.157
THAT HAVE BEEN LOGGING SO LONG

01:30:29.223 --> 01:30:31.726
EXISTING- IN OUR EDUCATION

01:30:31.793 --> 01:30:35.963
SYSTEM. AND IT'S IS ABSOLUTELY

01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:37.999
IN THE SHORT TERM ABOUT HAVING

01:30:38.065 --> 01:30:40.802
ADEQUATE INFRASTRUCTURE AND

01:30:40.868 --> 01:30:42.403
TECHNOLOGY TO ALL STUDENTS FOR

01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:45.039
DISTANCE LEARNING BUT EVEN POST

01:30:45.106 --> 01:30:47.475
PANDEMIC I THINK THAT- THE LACK

01:30:47.542 --> 01:30:49.110
OF ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY

01:30:49.177 --> 01:30:50.945
DISADVANTAGES SO MANY STUDENTS.

01:30:51.012 --> 01:30:52.947
AND HAS INDICATED- IN URBAN

01:30:53.014 --> 01:30:55.516
AREAS- JUST AS MUCH AS A RURAL

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:57.351
COMMUNITIES AND SPEED IS AN

01:30:57.418 --> 01:30:58.920
ISSUE IN BOTH PUBLICLY RURAL

01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:00.555
COMMUNITIES BUT EVEN AS IN THE

01:31:00.621 --> 01:31:01.956
CASE THAT YOU HAVE MULTIPLE

01:31:02.023 --> 01:31:05.526
LEARNERS AND US AND- HOUSEHOLD

01:31:05.593 --> 01:31:07.962
THE SPEEDERS. HAVE BROWN AND I

01:31:08.029 --> 01:31:09.897
HAD A ME WITH. OUR COUNTY. OF

01:31:09.964 --> 01:31:11.532
SCHOOLS A SUNBURST BOARD AND

01:31:11.599 --> 01:31:15.036
AREA AND- I THINK THAT THE- ONE

01:31:15.102 --> 01:31:17.505
OF THE ISSUES THAT ARISES. IS

01:31:17.572 --> 01:31:18.539
THE FACT THAT THERE CERTAINLY

01:31:18.606 --> 01:31:19.707
ARE SO MANY DISTRICTS OF SO

01:31:19.774 --> 01:31:21.676
MANY COMPANIES YEAH THE

01:31:21.742 --> 01:31:22.276
GOVERNMENT YOU HAVE THE STATE

01:31:22.343 --> 01:31:24.679
YET- THE DISTRICTS AND IF

01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:26.547
THERE'S NOT A UNIFORM SYSTEM I

01:31:26.614 --> 01:31:28.549
THINK THIS SPEAKS. TO THE

01:31:28.616 --> 01:31:29.984
QUESTION FROM THE SUMMER SMITH

01:31:30.051 --> 01:31:32.119
AND SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE A

01:31:32.186 --> 01:31:34.388
OF THAT- REALLY THE IT IS

01:31:34.455 --> 01:31:35.690
BECOMING UTILITY THAT THEY NEED

01:31:35.756 --> 01:31:37.191
TO HAVE NOT JUST INTERNET

01:31:37.258 --> 01:31:38.659
ACCESS BUT HIGH SPEED

01:31:38.726 --> 01:31:41.095
ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN AND SO

01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:42.663
IN ADDITION TO WHAT THE COST

01:31:42.730 --> 01:31:46.234
WOULD BE. WHAT OF WHAT WOULD BE

01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:49.270
THE NECESSARY MAJESTIC'S TO

01:31:49.337 --> 01:31:53.007
CREATE A UNIFORM SYSTEM WORSE

01:31:53.074 --> 01:31:55.977
PARENTS STUDENTS ONLY THE

01:31:56.043 --> 01:31:59.647
HARAPPAN ORDER ONE- PLATFORM

01:31:59.714 --> 01:32:01.515
ONE PLACE TO GO- THAT IS

01:32:01.582 --> 01:32:03.784
IDEALLY EITHER STATE RUNNER

01:32:03.851 --> 01:32:04.886
LEAST COORDINATED WITH THE

01:32:04.952 --> 01:32:06.821
STATE BECAUSE WHAT I'M HEARING

01:32:06.888 --> 01:32:08.189
IS THAT IT'S JUST TOO CONFUSING

01:32:08.256 --> 01:32:09.390
AND TOO MANY STUDENTS ARE BEING

01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:11.158
LEFT OUT THE ONES THAT KNOW.

01:32:11.225 --> 01:32:12.894
THE PROGRAMS EXIST ARE GOING TO

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:13.661
GO TO THE PROGRAMS AS THE ONES

01:32:13.728 --> 01:32:15.129
THAT DON'T KNOW THE FAMILIES I

01:32:15.196 --> 01:32:18.199
DON'T KNOW- THAT ARE THE ONES

01:32:18.266 --> 01:32:18.866
THAT ARE HARDER TO REACH

01:32:18.933 --> 01:32:20.201
ESPECIALLY BY ON THE

01:32:20.268 --> 01:32:21.369
TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES

01:32:21.435 --> 01:32:22.270
BECAUSE THEY DON'T ACTUALLY

01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:24.071
KNOW WHERE THEY AE EITHER AND

01:32:24.138 --> 01:32:25.973
SO YOU KNOW ANY COMMENT ON THAT

01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:27.708
OR YOU KNOW JUST YOU CAN ACCEPT

01:32:27.775 --> 01:32:29.610
A COMMON AND WE CAN- OF MOBILE

01:32:29.677 --> 01:32:30.811
FOLLOW UP LATER. BUT I THINK

01:32:30.878 --> 01:32:32.280
THAT IT'S ABOUT THE MONEY BUT

01:32:32.346 --> 01:32:32.914
IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:35.082
INFRASTRUCTURE AND HAVING ONE

01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:37.418
PLACE TO GO TO MAKE IT EASIER

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:38.452
FOR FAMILIES AND STUDENTS ARE

01:32:38.519 --> 01:32:41.155
NOT HAVING THEM TO HAVE TO GO

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:41.622
TO TWO THREE FOUR FIVE

01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:43.557
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS COMPANIES

01:32:43.624 --> 01:32:45.526
AND WHAT HAVE YOU- BECAUSE

01:32:45.593 --> 01:32:52.300
RIGHT NOW THE INEQUITIES ARE.

01:32:52.366 --> 01:32:52.867
JUST ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE

01:32:52.934 --> 01:32:54.335
THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS CORK

01:32:54.402 --> 01:33:00.074
SILVA. THANK YOU THIS IS. THIS

01:33:00.141 --> 01:33:03.878
QUESTION IS FOR LINDA DARLING

01:33:03.945 --> 01:33:06.881
HAMMOND AND- I WANTED TO SAY A

01:33:06.948 --> 01:33:08.316
FEW THINGS BEFORE I ASKED

01:33:08.382 --> 01:33:10.985
QUESTION BUT AS SHE WAS THE

01:33:11.052 --> 01:33:14.188
NOTING IS YOU KNOW YOU NOT ONLY

01:33:14.255 --> 01:33:16.824
HAVE THE RURAL CONNECTION- JUST

01:33:16.891 --> 01:33:18.893
WITH SAID YOU ALSO HAVE AN

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:21.128
INNER CITY CONNECTION ISSUES

01:33:21.195 --> 01:33:23.064
FAMILY ISSUES BUT ONE OF THE

01:33:23.130 --> 01:33:23.998
THINGS WE HAVEN'T ADDRESSED

01:33:24.065 --> 01:33:25.967
TODAY IT ISN'T JUST OUR

01:33:26.033 --> 01:33:27.501
CHILDREN THAT ARE HAVING ISSUES

01:33:27.568 --> 01:33:28.869
IT'S ALSO OUR WORKERS AND

01:33:28.936 --> 01:33:31.739
EMPLOYEES MANY EMPLOYEES- NOT

01:33:31.806 --> 01:33:34.408
ONLY WERE ASKED BUT- BUT HAD TO

01:33:34.475 --> 01:33:36.143
MAKE A CHOICE TO WORK REMOTELY

01:33:36.210 --> 01:33:37.011
SO THEY HAVE THOSE VERY SAME

01:33:37.078 --> 01:33:39.413
ISSUE. BUT WE ALSO HAVE SOME

01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:41.115
CITIES ACROSS THE STATE OF

01:33:41.182 --> 01:33:42.917
CALIFORNIA THAT AS I MENTIONED

01:33:42.984 --> 01:33:45.386
MY EARLIER COMMENTS INVESTED

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:46.887
AND WERE ABLE TO BRING SOME OF

01:33:46.954 --> 01:33:49.357
THAT BROADBAND THROUGH A CITY

01:33:49.423 --> 01:33:51.993
SCHOOL DISTRICT PARTNERSHIPS-

01:33:52.059 --> 01:33:53.861
WE CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT NOT ALL

01:33:53.928 --> 01:33:56.597
HAVE DONE THAT BUT NOW WHEN YOU

01:33:56.664 --> 01:33:58.799
LOOK AT ADULT WORKERS WORKING

01:33:58.866 --> 01:34:01.135
REMOTELY FOR A LOOK AT OUR

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:01.836
STUDENTS THAT NEED TO HAVE

01:34:01.902 --> 01:34:03.904
ACCESS AND CITIES THAT NEED TO

01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:05.840
PARTICIPATE. THIS DEFINITELY

01:34:05.906 --> 01:34:08.042
COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:10.444
PARTNERSHIPS THAT UP WHETHER

01:34:10.511 --> 01:34:12.380
THEY'RE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED

01:34:12.446 --> 01:34:14.048
WHETHER- THERE'S NO OTHER

01:34:14.115 --> 01:34:16.384
ALTERNATIVE BUT PEOPLE TO JOIN

01:34:16.450 --> 01:34:18.919
FORCES AS FAR AS FUNDING SO MY

01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:23.924
QUESTION TO. MISS HAMMOND IS

01:34:23.991 --> 01:34:25.526
RIGHT NOW WE'RE SEEING MODELS

01:34:25.593 --> 01:34:27.528
OF SOME STUDENTS RETURNING AND

01:34:27.595 --> 01:34:29.930
A HYBRID MODEL- MATTER OF FACT

01:34:29.997 --> 01:34:32.166

OUTBREAKS AND HAD TO CLOSE-

01:34:45.112 --> 01:34:46.881
THAT TO ME SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE

01:34:46.947 --> 01:34:49.050
THAT WITH EVERYBODY JOINING

01:34:49.116 --> 01:34:50.284

THE INTERNET- SERVICES- TO THE

01:37:51.465 --> 01:37:52.967
STUDENTS FOR EXAMPLE I'VE BEEN

01:37:53.033 --> 01:37:55.069
READING A LOT ABOUT- SHOWN WITH

01:37:55.135 --> 01:37:56.770
TENNESSEE MUNICIPAL INTERNET

01:37:56.837 --> 01:37:58.839
DISTRICT THAT'S- BEEN ABLE TO

01:37:58.906 --> 01:38:01.609
CONNECT OVER THIRTY TWO.

01:38:01.675 --> 01:38:03.077
THOUSAND STUDENTS TO HIGH SPEED

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:05.346
INTERNET AND ROUTERS. AND

01:38:05.412 --> 01:38:07.248

ABLE TO DO THAT HERE BUT I'M

01:38:18.058 --> 01:38:19.927
WONDERING. IF THAT IS SOMETHING

01:38:19.994 --> 01:38:21.562
THAT YOU'RE SEEN HAPPENING

01:38:21.629 --> 01:38:24.331
OUTSIDE. AT AND FOR US TO

01:38:24.398 --> 01:38:25.899
CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S

01:38:25.966 --> 01:38:27.234
A DIRECTION THAT WE NEED TO GO

01:38:27.301 --> 01:38:29.503
IN. FOR PURPOSES OF- BE MORE

01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:31.438
EFFECTIVE AND I AND I PUT THAT

01:38:31.505 --> 01:38:33.307
ON THE TABLE GIVEN THAT IN SOME

01:38:33.374 --> 01:38:34.842
PLACES IN CALIFORNIA I

01:38:34.908 --> 01:38:36.010
REPRESENT RIVERSIDE COUNTY PRO

01:38:36.076 --> 01:38:38.379
COUNTY. THE AFFECTION INFECTION

01:38:38.445 --> 01:38:40.314
RATES ARE NOT GOING TO. AND

01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:42.583
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GOING INTO.

01:38:42.650 --> 01:38:44.518
A DIFFERENT PHASE OF- THE

01:38:44.585 --> 01:38:45.419
METRICS THAT HAVE BEEN SAVED

01:38:45.486 --> 01:38:47.655
SET BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:38:47.721 --> 01:38:48.255
AND SO THAT MEANS THAT WE MAY

01:38:48.322 --> 01:38:51.458
BE IN. LOCKDOWN MODE- FOR

01:38:51.525 --> 01:38:52.760
LONGER PERIODS OF TIME AND

01:38:52.826 --> 01:38:54.128
THAT'S UNFORTUNATE BUT THAT

01:38:54.194 --> 01:38:55.229
MEANS THAT OUR CHILDREN WILL

01:38:55.296 --> 01:38:56.864
REMAIN. IN THIS DISTANCE

01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:59.566
LEARNING. SITUATION YET

01:38:59.633 --> 01:39:01.502
CONNECTIVITY REMAINS A PROBLEM

01:39:01.568 --> 01:39:03.737
SPEED REMAINS A PROBLEM. AND

01:39:03.804 --> 01:39:07.007
ULTIMATELY- CONTINUING TO SEE A

01:39:07.074 --> 01:39:09.877
GAP. IN THE LEARNING CAPACITIES

01:39:09.943 --> 01:39:11.945
OF OUR CHILDREN AND SO. I'M

01:39:12.012 --> 01:39:13.280
WONDERING IF YOU HAVE SOME

01:39:13.347 --> 01:39:15.149
EXAMPLES WHETHER THE LEAD TO

01:39:15.215 --> 01:39:18.485
THE CHATTANOOGA. EXAMPLE AND IF

01:39:18.552 --> 01:39:20.421
SO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE

01:39:20.487 --> 01:39:21.522
SHOULD BE LOOKING AT AS A

01:39:21.588 --> 01:39:23.657
PUBLIC POLICY REFORM. AS WE'RE

01:39:23.724 --> 01:39:26.126

NEW- INNOVATION. A COMPETITION.

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:01.568
THAT WE'RE ABOUT THE ROLLOUT.

01:49:01.635 --> 01:49:03.236
AS IT RELATES TO THE OPENING OF

01:49:03.303 --> 01:49:05.305
SCHOOLS I THINK THAT AS A

01:49:05.372 --> 01:49:06.206
GENERAL KNOWLEDGE THAT IN THE

01:49:06.273 --> 01:49:07.607
BEGINNING WE ALL AGREE. THAT

01:49:07.674 --> 01:49:08.875
ULTIMATELY THE BEST PLACE FOR

01:49:08.942 --> 01:49:10.310
OUR STUDENTS IS TO BE IN SCHOOL

01:49:10.377 --> 01:49:12.145
BUT WHEN WE CAN GET THERE. WHEN

FAITH ENOUGH. FOR THEM TO DO

01:49:14.948 --> 01:49:16.750
SO. WE ARE SEEING SO MANY

EXAMPLES OF PLACES WHERE

01:49:18.418 --> 01:49:19.052
THERE'S TOO MANY QUESTIONS

01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:21.021
ABOUT THE SAFETY. FOR OUR

01:49:21.087 --> 01:49:22.355
STUDENTS AND OUR EDUCATORS AND

01:49:22.422 --> 01:49:24.157
OUR FAMILIES. AND WE HAVE TO

01:49:24.224 --> 01:49:25.292
PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY AND THAT

01:49:25.358 --> 01:49:34.467
MEANS. THAT FOR NOW. FOR MANY

01:49:34.534 --> 01:49:36.136
OF OUR COMMUNITIES. DEFENSE

01:49:36.202 --> 01:49:38.471

TOMORROW. IS THE BIGGEST EQUITY

01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:26.186
ISSUE OF OUR TIME WE DO HAVE TO

01:50:26.252 --> 01:50:28.021
WORK TO OFFSET LEARNING GAPS.

01:50:28.088 --> 01:50:29.956
AND HAVING ACCESS TO COMPUTERS

01:50:30.023 --> 01:50:31.624
IS A TOOL FOR DOING THAT IT

01:50:31.691 --> 01:50:32.726
DOESN'T REPLACE WHAT A GREAT

01:50:32.792 --> 01:50:34.160
PIECE YOU CAN DO. BUT WE'RE IN

01:50:34.227 --> 01:50:35.562

SPEAK TO IT I DON'T WANT TO

01:51:17.137 --> 01:51:18.638
POLITICIZE THIS ISSUE THIS IS

01:51:18.705 --> 01:51:20.440
ABOUT STATE FIRST. AND FOREMOST

01:51:20.507 --> 01:51:22.042

OPEN TO SERVE. AND IT HAS

01:51:27.447 --> 01:51:29.582
RESULTED IN AND REAL HARM AND

01:51:29.649 --> 01:51:31.117
I'LL JUST SAY THAT WITHOUT THE

01:51:31.184 --> 01:51:31.851
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

01:51:31.918 --> 01:51:33.486
EDUCATION HAS LITERALLY.

01:51:33.553 --> 01:51:34.754
ORGANIZED MEETINGS BETWEEN

01:51:34.821 --> 01:51:36.356
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT AND

01:51:36.423 --> 01:51:38.458
COUNTY HEALTH OFFICERS. TO HELP

01:51:38.525 --> 01:51:39.659
US FIGURE OUT HOW TO TRACK THE

01:51:39.726 --> 01:51:42.462
DATA. ABOUT RATE OF INFECTION

01:51:42.529 --> 01:51:44.164
TO MAKE SMART STATE AGENCY

01:51:44.230 --> 01:51:45.632
ABOUT WHEN SCHOOLS CAN OPEN

01:51:45.698 --> 01:51:46.966
THERE ARE MORE QUESTIONS RIGHT

01:51:47.033 --> 01:51:48.368
NOW THAN ANSWERS. BUT WHAT IS

01:51:48.435 --> 01:51:50.103
CLEAR THAT WE CAN DO MORE WE

01:51:50.170 --> 01:51:51.771
STAND TOGETHER ON BEHALF

01:51:51.838 --> 01:51:53.506
HORRIFICALLY INCIDENTS IN. THE

01:51:53.573 --> 01:51:55.575
STATE PARAMOUNT- IT WILL

01:51:55.642 --> 01:51:56.609
CONTINUE TO PUSH THAT UNTIL

01:51:56.676 --> 01:51:57.610
IT'S SAFE FOR OUR SCHOOLS TO

01:51:57.677 --> 01:51:59.279
REOPEN. GREAT SO FOR THOSE WHO

01:51:59.345 --> 01:52:00.814
SAY THAT EVEN SCHOOLS THAT CAN

01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:02.248
SAFELY OPEN MAYBE SHOULDN'T

01:52:02.315 --> 01:52:03.416
BECAUSE IT'S UNFAIR FOR THEM TO

01:52:03.483 --> 01:52:10.156
HAVE A HEAD START. YOU WOULD.

01:52:10.223 --> 01:52:10.790
DISAVOW THAT LINE OF REASONING.

01:52:10.857 --> 01:52:11.958
NOT SURE ELSE TO PUT IT OTHER

01:52:12.025 --> 01:52:14.594
THAN THE FAKE IS PARA THAT IS

01:52:14.661 --> 01:52:16.796
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. I

01:52:16.863 --> 01:52:17.864
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE MANY

01:52:17.931 --> 01:52:19.799
SCHOOLS THAT ARE EXPERIMENTING

01:52:19.866 --> 01:52:20.667
WITH OPENING I THINK THEY'VE

01:52:20.733 --> 01:52:22.168
BEEN VERY. SOME OF BEING

01:52:22.235 --> 01:52:23.837
CREATIVE. WITH TRYING TO FIND

01:52:23.903 --> 01:52:26.906
HYRID- THAT MIGHT WORK OUT BUT

01:52:26.973 --> 01:52:27.841
THERE ARE STILL QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:52:27.907 --> 01:52:30.610
HOW. GREAT THE TRANSMISSION CAN

01:52:30.677 --> 01:52:33.213
OCCUR- THE NEW DATA THAT SAYS

01:52:33.279 --> 01:52:34.848
THAT KOBE COULD BE WITH US WELL

01:52:34.914 --> 01:52:36.649
BEYOND TWENTY TWENTY ONE.

01:52:36.716 --> 01:52:38.017
THERE'S NEW DATA THAT TALKS

01:52:38.084 --> 01:52:40.086
ABOUT- YOU KNOW HERE FOR

01:52:40.153 --> 01:52:41.955
TRANSMISSION RATE AND SHARING

01:52:42.021 --> 01:52:43.389
THE SAME INTERNET. YOU HAVE TO

01:52:43.456 --> 01:52:44.824
ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR

01:52:44.891 --> 01:52:46.192
BILL TRANSIENT. AND THINK THAT

01:52:46.259 --> 01:52:48.294
WE JUST DO NOT KNOW AND CLEARLY

01:52:48.361 --> 01:52:49.596
LOTS OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE

01:52:49.662 --> 01:52:52.098
EQUIPMENT. HAS TO BE AVAILABLE

01:52:52.165 --> 01:52:53.133
I THINK THIS IS THE TIME FOR GO

01:52:53.199 --> 01:52:55.935
SLOW AND STEADY. AND BE FOCUSED

01:52:56.002 --> 01:52:57.871

SOME OF THIS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

01:53:21.895 --> 01:53:22.929
BE ANSWERED TODAY BUT I WANTED

TALENTS OF THESE QUESTIONS

01:53:36.743 --> 01:53:38.111
BECAUSE I THINK WE'LL TAKE A

01:53:38.178 --> 01:53:39.379
LOOK AT THIS AND I AND I THINK

COMMUNITIES OF COLOR HAVE BEEN

01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:56.596
HARDER HIT BOTH THE IN COVERT

01:53:56.663 --> 01:54:01.167

SPACE FOR KIDS TO LEARN- BUT IS

01:54:09.409 --> 01:54:11.010
THERE IN BUT THERE'S A LOT OF

01:54:11.077 --> 01:54:11.945
THINGS THAT WE'VE NOT TALKED

01:54:12.011 --> 01:54:13.413
ABOUT THAT PARTICULARLY

01:54:13.479 --> 01:54:15.281
SURROUND HOW TO BRIDGE THE

LITERACY- THE DIGITAL LITERACY

01:54:28.061 --> 01:54:29.229
LIKE I TAKE MYSELF BACK TO

01:54:50.416 --> 01:54:52.719
ABOVE THE FOR THE COMMUNITY

01:54:52.785 --> 01:54:54.053
THAT I LARGELY REPRESENT.

01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:56.189
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE IN

01:54:56.256 --> 01:54:58.725
AN AFFLUENT COMMUNITY A NEARBY

01:54:58.791 --> 01:55:01.294
CAR PROFESSIONAL- THERE'S A

01:55:01.361 --> 01:55:02.929
DIFFERENT SORT OF CONVERSATION

01:55:02.996 --> 01:55:03.463
AS IT RELATES TO DISTANCE

01:55:03.529 --> 01:55:05.598
LEARNING BUT IF YOU'RE

01:55:05.665 --> 01:55:06.499
REPRESENT THE COMMUNITIES I

01:55:06.566 --> 01:55:07.834
REPRESENT. IT'S WHERE YOU'RE

01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:08.568
GOING TO SEE THE PICTURES THE

01:55:08.635 --> 01:55:10.570
KIDS ARE SITTING ON AN IPHONE

01:55:10.637 --> 01:55:13.573
OR A LIFELINE PHONE OUTSIDE TO

01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:15.141
TALK ABOUT- BECAUSE I MAY BE

01:55:15.208 --> 01:55:16.342
THE ONLY INTERNET CONNECTION IN

01:55:16.409 --> 01:55:17.677
THE ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD TO SOME

01:55:17.744 --> 01:55:19.779
DEGREE AND STILL NOT. EQUITABLE

01:55:19.846 --> 01:55:23.182
WHEN IT COMES TO SPEEDS. LET

01:55:23.249 --> 01:55:25.051
ALONE TECHNOLOGY LEVEL LITERACY

01:55:25.118 --> 01:55:26.953
LEVEL ON EDUCATION. AND I THINK

01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:28.221
I'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION WITH

01:55:28.288 --> 01:55:29.822
EDUCATION LEADERS AND- AROUND

01:55:29.889 --> 01:55:31.591
THIS ISSUE. HAS THERE BEEN

01:55:31.658 --> 01:55:33.126
GIVEN THE ROLE BOB IS A BIGGER

01:55:33.192 --> 01:55:34.761
MEET MEET SOME SORT OF EQUITY

01:55:34.827 --> 01:55:35.762
AS A COME THE DIGITAL DIVIDE

01:55:35.828 --> 01:55:37.563
AND LEARNING. YOU HAVE DOT TAKE

01:55:37.630 --> 01:55:39.232

THAT THERE IS SOME. DIGITAL

01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:46.439
pMOUNTAINS OF GAPS AND VALLEYS

01:55:46.506 --> 01:55:48.241
WHEN IT COMES TO. WORKING CLASS

01:55:48.308 --> 01:55:50.743
COMMUNITIES. THAT MAY NOT HAVE

01:55:50.810 --> 01:55:53.112
THAT- LET ALONE TRYING TO TEACH

01:55:53.179 --> 01:55:59.152
A KID. NOW GONE. IT WILL

01:55:59.218 --> 01:56:00.687
RECEIVE THE FOOD LINES AND

01:56:00.753 --> 01:56:02.021
LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

01:56:02.088 --> 01:56:03.990
WE WORK WITH EVERY WEEK- WHERE

01:56:04.057 --> 01:56:04.957
PARENTS ARE SITTING IN FOOD

01:56:05.024 --> 01:56:07.126
LINES AND THEY OFTENTIMES WILL

01:56:07.193 --> 01:56:08.428
BRING THEIR EDUCATION PACKAGES

01:56:08.494 --> 01:56:09.429
AND SAY WHAT WHAT THE WHAT IS

01:56:09.495 --> 01:56:10.196
THIS. I CAN'T TRANSLATE I

01:56:10.263 --> 01:56:12.165
CAN'T. CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITH

01:56:12.231 --> 01:56:13.766
IT LET ALONE IF YOU HAVEN'T.

01:56:13.833 --> 01:56:16.469
LET ALONE IF YOU HAD ALL THE

01:56:16.536 --> 01:56:17.036
EQUIPMENT AT HOME WHAT WOULD

01:56:17.103 --> 01:56:18.938
YOU DO WITH IT ANYWAY. IT'S OF

01:56:19.005 --> 01:56:20.273
IT HAS TO BE SOME THOUGHT. DONE

01:56:20.340 --> 01:56:21.841
BEYOND JUST CONNECTING BECAUSE

01:56:21.908 --> 01:56:22.975
IT WOULD BE INADEQUATE TO

01:56:23.042 --> 01:56:24.310
THINK. THAT THE CONVERSATION

01:56:24.377 --> 01:56:26.479
ABOUT THE DISTANCE LEARNING. IS

01:56:26.546 --> 01:56:28.214
JUST ABOUT CONNECTION TABLETS.

01:56:28.281 --> 01:56:29.615
THERE'S SOME THOUGHT TO BE

01:56:29.682 --> 01:56:31.351
GIVEN. NOW IN THE FUTURE ABOUT

01:56:31.417 --> 01:56:33.986
LITERACY AROUND PARENTS. AND

01:56:34.053 --> 01:56:35.655
WHAT I WOULD CAN HOPEFULLY THE

01:56:35.722 --> 01:56:36.789
CARD HOLDER. APPROACH TO HOW

01:56:36.856 --> 01:56:38.691
THIS IS REALLY GONNA WORK.

01:56:38.758 --> 01:56:39.726
OTHERWISE WE WILL BE LEAVING A

01:56:39.792 --> 01:56:42.195
GENERATION OF. KIDS BEHIND-

01:56:42.261 --> 01:56:43.529
INCLUDED IN THAT CONVERSATION

01:56:43.596 --> 01:56:44.731
HAS TO BE CONVERSATION OF

01:56:44.797 --> 01:56:47.166
FAIRNESS TO TEACHERS- OR THE

01:56:47.233 --> 01:56:48.368
EDUCATION COMMUNITY AT LARGE

01:56:48.434 --> 01:56:49.736
BECAUSE IF. IF YOUR TEACHER

01:56:49.802 --> 01:56:52.405
EXPECTED TEACHER TODAY WHAT

01:56:52.472 --> 01:56:53.206
WOULD YOU DO WITH YOUR KIDS

01:56:53.272 --> 01:56:56.008
YEAH. MADE LIKE MANY OF US WHO

01:56:56.075 --> 01:56:57.944
HAVE TO WORK FROM HOME THE-

01:56:58.010 --> 01:57:01.214
COULD YOU IMAGINE ON ON ON AND

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:04.417
ON. I NEED LESS THAN MINIMUM

01:57:04.484 --> 01:57:08.020
WAGE JOB AND HAVING TO DECIDE

01:57:08.087 --> 01:57:09.956
WHETHER YOUR KIDS GOING TO GET

01:57:10.022 --> 01:57:11.591
AN EDUCATION THAT DAY OR YOU'RE

01:57:11.657 --> 01:57:13.126
GOING TO GO TO OR YOU'RE GOING

01:57:13.192 --> 01:57:14.794
TO GO TO WORK AND THIS IDEA

01:57:14.861 --> 01:57:16.362
THAT YOU PUT A KID IN FRONT OF

01:57:16.429 --> 01:57:17.230
A COMPUTER AND THEY'RE JUST

01:57:17.296 --> 01:57:18.765
GONNA LEARN JUST DOESN'T REALLY

01:57:18.831 --> 01:57:20.066
MEET THE DEMAND OF THE DAY AND

01:57:20.133 --> 01:57:21.768
WHAT REALLY IS PRESENT. I GOT

01:57:21.834 --> 01:57:24.103
TWO KIDS A FOUR YEAR OLD AND A

01:57:24.170 --> 01:57:26.739
SEVEN YEAR OLD. THE SEVEN YEAR

01:57:26.806 --> 01:57:28.975
OLD HAS A BETTER TIME STANDING

01:57:29.041 --> 01:57:30.476
IN FRONT OF A STANFORD COMPUTER

01:57:30.543 --> 01:57:31.844
BUT THERE ARE MULTIPLE GLITCHES

01:57:31.911 --> 01:57:32.745
AND I'VE GOT THE FASTEST

01:57:32.812 --> 01:57:34.280
INTERCEDING INTERNET SPEED IN

01:57:34.347 --> 01:57:35.581
THAT AREA. AND THEY STILL BUMP

01:57:35.648 --> 01:57:37.183
OFF WHEN IT'S MORE THAN. WHAT

01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:38.217
IT'S TWO KIDS BUT IF I GET ON

01:57:38.284 --> 01:57:39.352
SOMETHING A BOMB CITING A

01:57:39.419 --> 01:57:40.353
RESTART COMPUTERS GOT TO GET

01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:42.221
GOING THERE'S A LOT OF. STUFF

01:57:42.288 --> 01:57:42.822
THERE THAT I DON'T KNOW WHAT I

01:57:42.889 --> 01:57:46.125
WOULD CONSIDER MYSELF SOMEWHAT.

01:57:46.192 --> 01:57:46.726
SOPHISTICATED WHEN IT COMES TO

01:57:46.793 --> 01:57:48.094
TECHNOLOGY AND I STILL STRUGGLE

01:57:48.161 --> 01:57:49.195
WITH THE COMPUTER TO GET BACK

01:57:49.262 --> 01:57:50.496
ON IN THAT LINK ZOOMS NOT

01:57:50.563 --> 01:57:52.031
CONNECTING AND THERE'S- ALL

01:57:52.098 --> 01:57:52.932
THESE DIFFERENT CHAT ROOMS YOU

01:57:52.999 --> 01:57:53.633
GOT TO GET INTO IT YOU GOTTA

01:57:53.699 --> 01:57:54.934
GET A SEPARATE CHAT ROOM AFTER

YOU DO READING AND- AND I

01:57:56.502 --> 01:57:57.670
FORGOT WHAT THE THAT THIS IS

01:57:57.737 --> 01:57:59.705
SOMETHING START TESTING- ROOM

01:57:59.772 --> 01:58:01.240
THAT HE GOT. HE HAS TO GET IN

01:58:01.307 --> 01:58:02.708
TO GET TESTED AFTER DOES WORK

01:58:02.775 --> 01:58:03.609
I'VE GOT TO SNAP A PICTURE OF

01:58:03.676 --> 01:58:04.610
THIS THING AND I GOT TO SEND IT

01:58:04.677 --> 01:58:06.145
BACK TO THE TEACHERS GOTTA GET

01:58:06.212 --> 01:58:06.979
GRADED. IT'S GOING TO COME BACK

01:58:07.046 --> 01:58:07.880
IN THIS HOMEWORK IN THE

01:58:07.947 --> 01:58:11.017
AFTERNOON. SO COULD YOU IMAGINE.

01:58:11.083 --> 01:58:11.984
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT STRUGGLING

01:58:12.051 --> 01:58:13.519
COMMUNITIES. THAT HAVE TO MAKE

01:58:13.586 --> 01:58:17.590
THE DECISION. THEY EITHER WORK.

01:58:17.657 --> 01:58:22.895
OR HAVE YOU CAN GET EDUCATE.

01:58:22.962 --> 01:58:24.430
WELL IT IN EVEN THE ASSUMPTION

01:58:24.497 --> 01:58:25.965
THAT IT THAT IT THAT IT'S

01:58:26.032 --> 01:58:28.234
WORKING TO A LARGE DEGREE. I

01:58:28.301 --> 01:58:29.135
THINK WE HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE

01:58:29.202 --> 01:58:31.103
THAT. BOTH WITH TEACHERS WHO

01:58:31.170 --> 01:58:33.139
ARE EXPECTED TO TEACH. OUR THE

01:58:33.206 --> 01:58:35.208
SCHOOL DAY AND BOTH MY PARENTS.

01:58:35.274 --> 01:58:37.410
ARE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

01:58:37.477 --> 01:58:38.077
I TALK ABOUT IT SO THE REASON I

01:58:38.144 --> 01:58:39.679
SAY THAT IS BECAUSE- I KNOW I'M

01:58:39.745 --> 01:58:40.446
LONG WINDED BUT A VERY

01:58:40.513 --> 01:58:41.447
PASSIONATE ABOUT IT BECAUSE

01:58:41.514 --> 01:58:43.783
WHEN YEARS THAT I REPRESENT.

01:58:43.850 --> 01:58:44.550
THE YEARS THAT I REPRESENT AND

01:58:44.617 --> 01:58:45.551
I'LL SPEAK TO MY- I KNOW THE

01:58:45.618 --> 01:58:46.919
OTHERS HAVE THE SAME. SIMILAR

01:58:46.986 --> 01:58:48.054
SITUATION BUT I CAN'T SPEAK

01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:49.522
YOUR DISTRICTS OF SPEAK FOR THE

01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:51.424
ONE I REPRESENT- ARE

01:58:51.491 --> 01:58:53.359
EXPERIENCING THIS. AND IT'S NOT

01:58:53.426 --> 01:58:54.727
JUST THE ONE OFFERS NOT JUST

01:58:54.794 --> 01:58:55.895
TWO PEOPLE TALKING TO ME IT'S-

01:58:55.962 --> 01:58:58.431
OVER AND OVER AND- OVER AND-

01:58:58.498 --> 01:59:00.299
OVER. AND EVEN MY NEIGHBORS

01:59:00.366 --> 01:59:02.168
RECENTLY- AFTER ALMOST SIX

01:59:02.235 --> 01:59:03.102
MONTHS OR FIVE MONTHS THE

01:59:03.169 --> 01:59:05.271
PANDEMIC WERE ABLE TO. HUSTLE

01:59:05.338 --> 01:59:07.874
ENOUGH MONEY TO GET THE

01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:10.109
INTERNET. SERVICE AND OVER AND

01:59:10.176 --> 01:59:11.344
TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO. HOW

01:59:11.410 --> 01:59:13.713
TO GET NOW TABLETS AND IPHONES

01:59:13.779 --> 01:59:16.349
AND DO HOMEWORK WITH THE KIDS.

01:59:16.415 --> 01:59:16.949
SO AT SOME POINT TIME GETTING

01:59:17.016 --> 01:59:17.550
KIND OF REINVENT THE WAY THE

01:59:17.617 --> 01:59:19.785
EDUCATION IS BEING DONE-

01:59:19.852 --> 01:59:20.920
WHETHER IT'S DONE AT ALL YOU

01:59:20.987 --> 01:59:22.021
KNOW I KNOW I. WHETHER IT'S

01:59:22.088 --> 01:59:23.022
DONE DIFFERENTLY WHETHER IT'S

01:59:23.089 --> 01:59:24.991
DONE SHORTER A SHORTER DAYS.

01:59:25.057 --> 01:59:27.093
I'M CERTAINLY NOT TRYING TO GET

01:59:27.159 --> 01:59:29.795
IN BETWEEN. ANY ANY AGREEMENTS

01:59:29.862 --> 01:59:30.596
THE LOCAL DISTRICTS HAVE MADE

01:59:30.663 --> 01:59:31.831
WITH ITS WORKFORCE BY THINK

01:59:31.898 --> 01:59:33.332
IT'S TIME TO REIMAGINE FOR

01:59:33.399 --> 01:59:34.333
GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND

01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:35.568
THINK ABOUT WHAT THE QUOTE

01:59:35.635 --> 01:59:37.203
UNQUOTE DAY AFTER LOOKS LIKE.

01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:38.538
THE DAY AFTER COOPER WE'RE

01:59:38.604 --> 01:59:41.607
GOING BE BROUGH TO BE SENT

01:59:41.674 --> 01:59:44.143
AROUND. NO THAT. WHAT HAVING

01:59:44.210 --> 01:59:46.579
GOOD KNOWLEDGE POTENTIALLY AND

01:59:46.646 --> 01:59:47.113
I HOPE NOT I HOPE THAT I'M

01:59:47.179 --> 01:59:49.282
WRONG. THE GENERATION THE KIDS

01:59:49.348 --> 01:59:51.017
GOT LEFT BEHIND BECAUSE WE

01:59:51.083 --> 01:59:52.051
COULDN'T TAKE A LOOK AT SOME

01:59:52.118 --> 01:59:53.286
SERIOUS PROBLEMS AND IDENTIFY

01:59:53.352 --> 01:59:55.555
THEM EARLY AND START WORKING ON

01:59:55.621 --> 01:59:57.590
IT FOR THAT. DAY AFTER. AND

01:59:57.657 --> 01:59:59.425
THAT DATE IS HAPPENING. I DO

01:59:59.492 --> 02:00:00.560
WANNA THROW THAT OUT THERE

02:00:00.626 --> 02:00:01.127
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A VERY

02:00:01.193 --> 02:00:02.328
SERIOUS CONVERSATION THE- TO

02:00:02.395 --> 02:00:03.462
CONTINUE HAVE I KNOW WE'RE ON

02:00:03.529 --> 02:00:05.398
THE SAME PAGE WALL ROLLING IN

02:00:05.464 --> 02:00:05.998
THE SAME DIRECTION BUT FOR THE

02:00:06.065 --> 02:00:07.600
SAKE OF. FOR THE FOR THE SAKE

02:00:07.667 --> 02:00:08.801
OF REPRESENTED JUST THE

02:00:08.868 --> 02:00:09.468
DISTRICTS IN THE REGION THAT I

02:00:09.535 --> 02:00:12.738
REPRESENT. THIS HAS TO BE AT

02:00:12.805 --> 02:00:13.172
THE FOREFRONT OF OUR

02:00:13.239 --> 02:00:15.174
COMMUNITIES. AS I HEAR EVERY

02:00:15.241 --> 02:00:16.275
DAY FROM PARENTS. THERE'S THAT

02:00:16.342 --> 02:00:17.877
LANGUAGE BARRIER. THERE'S THAT

02:00:17.944 --> 02:00:21.113
PRESSURE TO GO TO WORK. AND

02:00:21.180 --> 02:00:21.714
THERE'S KIDS AT HOME. AND IN

02:00:21.781 --> 02:00:22.515
THE DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT

02:00:22.582 --> 02:00:24.216
THAT I REPRESENT IT. THE SCHOOL

02:00:24.283 --> 02:00:25.084
DISTRICT FROM WHAT I

02:00:25.151 --> 02:00:26.953
UNDERSTAND. SOMETIMES IF YOU

02:00:27.019 --> 02:00:27.920
SEND ME EMAIL THE NIGHT BEFORE

02:00:27.987 --> 02:00:29.922
THAT CONSTITUTES. THE STATE OF

02:00:29.989 --> 02:00:31.691
YOUR PRESENT THAT DAY. LET ME

02:00:31.757 --> 02:00:32.792
THAT THIS IS NOT JUST TO

02:00:32.858 --> 02:00:34.093
PRESENT RIGHT HAS NOT. KID

02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:35.027
RECEIVE AN EDUCATION IF YOU

02:00:35.094 --> 02:00:37.129
TURN IN THE HOMEWORK THAT WAS A

02:00:37.196 --> 02:00:38.698
SIGN FOR THREE DAYS. THAT

02:00:38.764 --> 02:00:40.099
CONSTITUTES THE STUDENT BEING

02:00:40.166 --> 02:00:42.568
IN CLASS FOR THREE DAYS. SO

02:00:42.635 --> 02:00:43.502
CERTAINLY IS GONNA BE BETTER

02:00:43.569 --> 02:00:44.804
METRICS TO BETTER MEASUREMENTS

02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:46.639
AND WASTE ACTUALLY REALLY DIG

02:00:46.706 --> 02:00:48.274
INTO WHAT'S GOING ON AND EVEN

02:00:48.341 --> 02:00:49.375

02:15:46.271 --> 02:15:49.608
AMAZING STUDENTS. NEARLY 22% OF

02:15:49.674 --> 02:15:50.475
OUR STUDENTS ARE ENGLISH

02:15:50.542 --> 02:15:52.677
LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND OVER 80%

02:15:52.744 --> 02:15:53.745
OF OUR CHILDREN ARE SOCIAL

OVER 12% OUR STUDENTS WITH

02:15:59.851 --> 02:16:01.419
FROM ELEVATION OF SOME FIVE

02:16:01.486 --> 02:16:02.387
THOUSAND FEET DOWN TO THE

02:16:02.454 --> 02:16:04.289
VALLEY FLOOR. AND SOME OF OUR

02:16:04.356 --> 02:16:05.690
STUDENTS RIDE THE BUS OVER AN

02:16:05.757 --> 02:16:08.527
HOUR ONE WAY. OUR LARGEST

02:16:08.593 --> 02:16:09.594
ETHNIC GROUPS ARE HISPANIC

02:16:09.661 --> 02:16:12.097
LATINO AT APPROXIMATELY 43% OF

02:16:12.163 --> 02:16:14.032
OUR STUDENT POPULATION. AND

02:16:14.099 --> 02:16:15.267
WHITE AT APPROXIMATELY THIRTY

02:16:15.333 --> 02:16:17.469
SIX PERCENT. HOWEVER THAT

02:16:17.536 --> 02:16:20.105
VARIES WIDELY FROM SITE TO SITE.

02:16:20.171 --> 02:16:21.072
IF YOU BRING UP INTERNET

02:16:21.139 --> 02:16:23.174
CONNECTIVITY OF MY STUDENTS

02:16:23.241 --> 02:16:24.142
THEY WILL TELL YOU THE STRUGGLE

02:16:24.209 --> 02:16:25.677
IS REAL. AND IF YOU ASK

02:16:25.744 --> 02:16:27.445
TEACHERS IN MY DISTRICT THEY

02:16:27.512 --> 02:16:29.748
WILL ECHO THE SENTIMENT. ONE OF

02:16:29.814 --> 02:16:30.749
THE MANY REASONS FOR THIS IS

02:16:30.815 --> 02:16:31.816
THE FACT THAT MY STUDENTS FALL

02:16:31.883 --> 02:16:33.184
INTO ONE OF THREE DISTINCTLY

02:16:33.251 --> 02:16:35.320
DIFFERENT GROUPS. THOSE THAT

02:16:35.387 --> 02:16:35.754
HAVE FULL INTERNET

02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:37.522
CONNECTIVITY. THOSE THAT HAVE

02:16:37.589 --> 02:16:39.424
PROBLEMATIC OR MINIMAL INTERNET

02:16:39.491 --> 02:16:41.660
CONNECTIVITY. AND THOSE WHO

02:16:41.726 --> 02:16:43.995
LACK THE INTERNET COMPLETELY. A

02:16:44.062 --> 02:16:45.430
NUMBER OF OUR TEACHERS ALSO

02:16:45.497 --> 02:16:47.666
EXPERIENCE A COMPLETE ABSENCE

02:16:47.732 --> 02:16:48.266
OF OR POOR INTERNET SERVICE AT

02:16:48.333 --> 02:16:51.069
HOME. ADDITIONALLY THE TIME

02:16:51.136 --> 02:16:52.671
REQUIRED TO PREP FOR AND

02:16:52.737 --> 02:16:54.339
PROVIDE ALL ASPECTS OF DISTANCE

02:16:54.406 --> 02:16:56.508
LEARNING. INCLUDING ONLINE

02:16:56.575 --> 02:16:58.243
ENGAGEMENT STRATEGIES IN A

02:16:58.310 --> 02:17:00.211
RELATIONSHIP BUILDING. IS

02:17:00.278 --> 02:17:02.581
EXPONENTIALLY GREATER THAN WHAT

02:17:02.647 --> 02:17:03.148
IS NECESSARY FOR OUR REGULAR

02:17:03.214 --> 02:17:05.984
CLASSES. FOR EXAMPLE OUR

02:17:06.051 --> 02:17:07.285
STUDENTS VERY LEVELS OF

02:17:07.352 --> 02:17:08.186
CONNECTIVITY MAKE IT

02:17:08.253 --> 02:17:09.988
EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT TO

02:17:10.055 --> 02:17:11.823
GAUGE HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE

02:17:11.890 --> 02:17:12.457
STUDENTS TO COMPLETE LESSONS OR

02:17:12.524 --> 02:17:15.160
ASSIGNMENTS. ALTHOUGH MY

02:17:15.226 --> 02:17:16.795
STUDENTS ARE RESILIENT THEIR

02:17:16.861 --> 02:17:18.363
INTERNET CONNECTIVITY ISSUES

02:17:18.430 --> 02:17:19.664
ARE IMPEDING THEIR ABILITY TO

02:17:19.731 --> 02:17:21.199
ACCESS AND PARTICIPATE IN THEIR

02:17:21.266 --> 02:17:22.901
DISTANCE LEARNING. LEARNING

02:17:22.968 --> 02:17:25.103
THAT I IN NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED

02:17:25.170 --> 02:17:26.738
OTHERS ARE TIRELESSLY TRYING TO

02:17:26.805 --> 02:17:29.541
PROVIDE FOR THEM. RECENTLY ONE

02:17:29.608 --> 02:17:30.642
OF MY STUDENTS ASK FOR AN

02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:32.544
EXTENSION ON AN ASSIGNMENT. SHE

02:17:32.611 --> 02:17:34.179
EXPLAINED IN A LENGTHY ON

02:17:34.245 --> 02:17:36.414
PUNCTUATED A MOTIONAL EMAIL

02:17:36.481 --> 02:17:38.783
THAT HER INTERNET DIED. AFTER

02:17:38.850 --> 02:17:40.352
AN APPEARANCE BY THE BLUE

02:17:40.418 --> 02:17:42.420
CIRCLE OF DEATH AS SHE TRIED TO

02:17:42.487 --> 02:17:44.289
SENATOR SIMON ONLINE AND THEN

02:17:44.356 --> 02:17:46.925
IT WAS GONE. AS SHE EXPLAINED.

02:17:46.992 --> 02:17:50.562
GONE STEEG JUST GONE GONE LIKE

02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:51.129
HOMEMADE COOKIES LEFT ON THE

02:17:51.196 --> 02:17:53.264
COUNTER. AFTER WE WORKED FOR

02:17:53.331 --> 02:17:55.166
OVER AN HOUR TO UNSUCCESSFULLY

02:17:55.233 --> 02:17:57.836
FINE- ASSIGNMENT SHE DEJECTEDLY

02:17:57.902 --> 02:17:59.404
MATTERED THAT SHE WOULD DO THE

02:17:59.471 --> 02:18:02.107
ASSIGNMENT AGAIN. WHICH I DID

02:18:02.173 --> 02:18:04.275
NOT REQUIRE HER TO DO.

02:18:04.342 --> 02:18:06.645
UNFORTUNATELY THOUGH THIS

02:18:06.711 --> 02:18:09.547
SITUATION IS NOT AN ANOMALY.

02:18:09.614 --> 02:18:10.849
ONE OF THE MORE TRYING ASPECTS

02:18:10.915 --> 02:18:12.384
OF OUR DISTANCE LEARNING HAS

02:18:12.450 --> 02:18:14.386
INVOLVED VIDEO CONFERENCING I

02:18:14.452 --> 02:18:15.553

TIME TRYING TO JOIN OR STAY IN

HIS ROOM SESSION THEN THEY

02:18:20.659 --> 02:18:23.261
ACTUALLY SPEND IN THAT SESSION.

02:18:23.328 --> 02:18:23.762
IN MY EMAIL YOU CAN FIND

02:18:23.828 --> 02:18:26.164
VARIATIONS OF SORRY ABOUT THE

ZOOM BUT MY INTERNET HATES ME.

02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:29.734
IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR SOME OF

02:18:29.801 --> 02:18:31.036
MY STUDENTS TO HAVE TO RE ENTER

02:18:31.102 --> 02:18:33.271

IN THE PROCESS. UNFORTUNATELY

02:18:37.709 --> 02:18:39.844
ZOOM SITUATION ISN'T RESERVED

02:18:39.911 --> 02:18:42.280
JUST FOR STUDENTS. TWO WEEKS

02:18:42.347 --> 02:18:43.715
AGO I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF A

02:18:43.782 --> 02:18:45.283

PRINCIPAL WALKED IN AND ASKED

02:18:54.526 --> 02:18:57.028
IF I WAS OK. ONE OF MY STUDENTS

02:18:57.095 --> 02:18:58.396
HAD ACTUALLY CALLED THE SCHOOL

02:18:58.463 --> 02:19:00.732
CONCERNED ABOUT ME. WE LOST

APPROXIMATELY TEN MINUTES OF

YEARS OR MORE OUR FRANKLY

02:19:24.456 --> 02:19:27.592
UNACCEPTABLE. SOME MAY THINK

02:19:27.659 --> 02:19:29.094
BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE HOT

02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:30.995

HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF THOSE HOT

02:19:33.598 --> 02:19:36.701
SPOTS AND PURCHASED ANOTHER ONE

02:19:36.768 --> 02:19:38.103

STUDENTS HAVE EXPLAINED TO ME.

02:19:42.841 --> 02:19:44.909
I'M ON MY THIRD HOT SPOT AND

SPOT. OUR FOOT HILLS ARE

02:19:52.217 --> 02:19:54.119
COVERED BY CELL TOWERS FROM

02:19:54.185 --> 02:19:55.120
THREE MAJOR TELECOMMUNICATION

02:19:55.186 --> 02:19:56.855
COMPANIES. SO IT'S LIKE A

02:19:56.921 --> 02:19:58.456
TWISTED GAME OF HOT AND COLD

02:19:58.523 --> 02:19:59.858
WHEN OUR STUDENTS TRY TO OBTIN

02:19:59.924 --> 02:20:01.793
INTERNET SERVICE. AND WHEN IT'S

02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:03.428
DETERMINED THAT THEIR HOUSES TO

02:20:03.495 --> 02:20:04.929
COLD IN RELATION TO A CELL

02:20:04.996 --> 02:20:08.032
TOWER. THERE THEN FORCED PURSUE

02:20:08.099 --> 02:20:08.600
SATELLITE POINT TO POINT FOR

02:20:08.666 --> 02:20:10.602
INTERNET. FOR SOME OF MY

02:20:10.668 --> 02:20:12.437
STUDENTS THEIR SATELLITE LINE

02:20:12.504 --> 02:20:14.072
RUNS FROM THE TOP OF THE TREE

02:20:14.139 --> 02:20:16.441

02:20:19.944 --> 02:20:22.447
TO GET INTERNET ACCESS TOMORROW

02:20:22.514 --> 02:20:23.081
BECAUSE IT SIMPLY DOESN'T EXIST

02:20:23.148 --> 02:20:25.784
WHERE THEY LIVE. THESE CAN

02:20:25.850 --> 02:20:27.252
ACTIVITY ISSUES RESULT IN

02:20:27.318 --> 02:20:28.787
TROUBLING EQUITY ISSUES AND

02:20:28.853 --> 02:20:30.755
THESE EQUITY ISSUES ARE FELT

02:20:30.822 --> 02:20:32.524
EVEN MORE PROFOUNDLY ARE

02:20:32.590 --> 02:20:34.359
VULNERABLE SPECIAL EDUCATION.

THOUGH SHE'S BEEN DISTANCE

02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:32.042
LEARNING. AS OF YESTERDAY THEY

02:37:32.109 --> 02:37:33.577
STARTED BRINGING SOME STUDENTS

ARE DOING DISTANCE LEARNING SO.

02:37:39.683 --> 02:37:41.819
IT'S ABOUT THREE PARAGRAPHS BUT

02:37:41.885 --> 02:37:42.686
BUT I THINK IT PAINS OF THE

02:37:42.753 --> 02:37:45.289
PICTURE. OF WHAT A CHALLENGE IT

02:37:45.355 --> 02:37:48.091
IS BUT ALSO OF WHAT GREAT

02:37:48.158 --> 02:37:50.160
EDUCATORS WE HAVE OUT THERE WHO

02:37:50.227 --> 02:37:52.296
ARE. IN ESSENCE LEARNING ALONG

02:37:52.362 --> 02:37:54.097
WITH THE STUDENTS AND HAVING TO

MAKE ACCOMMODATIONS AND WHAT

02:37:55.899 --> 02:37:57.234
THE CHALLENGES AND SOME OF THE

02:37:57.301 --> 02:37:58.302
PARENTS HAVE SEEN THAT

02:37:58.368 --> 02:37:59.937
THEMSELVES AS THEY SIT NEXT TO

02:38:00.003 --> 02:38:01.638
THEIR STUDENTS. AT HOME DOING

02:38:01.705 --> 02:38:03.473
REMOTE LEARNING. SO SHE'S THE

02:38:03.540 --> 02:38:05.409
FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL UPDATE WE

02:38:05.475 --> 02:38:07.477

KEEP THIS GOING I CREATE AN

02:38:09.313 --> 02:38:11.181
ENTIRE SLIDE DECK WITH

02:38:23.927 --> 02:38:26.496
EASILY. I HAVE A STUDENT THAT

02:38:26.563 --> 02:38:28.732

THROUGH THE COMPUTER IT IS TOO

02:38:57.327 --> 02:38:59.696

IT COMES TO ENGLISH- IS A

02:41:07.324 --> 02:41:09.893
SECOND LANGUAGE- IN THE ABILITY

PASSED BY TEAM FOR THOSE

02:41:20.704 --> 02:41:22.172
NEIGHBORHOODS. THAT ARE

WE HAVE DEVELOPED OF IT WE HAVE

03:11:57.639 --> 03:11:58.206

INTERNET ACCESS AT HOME. WELL

03:12:02.444 --> 03:12:03.111
THIS WAS SIGNIFICANT IN

03:12:03.178 --> 03:12:04.579
ADDRESSING THE HOMEWORK GAP FOR

03:12:04.646 --> 03:12:06.281
THOSE EIGHT HUNDRED STUDENTS WE

03:12:06.348 --> 03:12:08.116
HAD NO IDEA THAT A PANDEMIC WAS

03:12:08.183 --> 03:12:09.551
ON THE HORIZON AND THE NEED FOR

03:12:09.618 --> 03:12:10.819
THE NETWORK WAS GOING TO BECOME

03:12:10.886 --> 03:12:12.354
MISSION CRITICAL FOR OUR

03:12:21.096 --> 03:12:21.930
HUNDRED STUDENTS PARTICIPATING

03:12:21.997 --> 03:12:23.431

03:12:23.498 --> 03:12:25.166
BORDER LINK ACCESS EACH DAY

03:12:25.233 --> 03:12:26.701
WELL THIS CURRENTLY REPRESENTS

03:12:26.768 --> 03:12:28.270
ABOUT 10% OF STUDENTS AND

03:12:28.336 --> 03:12:30.272

AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC AND

03:12:41.449 --> 03:12:41.883
OUR GOAL IS HAVING EVERY

03:12:41.950 --> 03:12:45.020

BY THE END OF THE YEAR. IT'S

03:12:45.654 --> 03:12:46.855
IMPORTANT ALSO TO DRAW A

03:12:46.922 --> 03:12:48.156
DISTINCTION BETWEEN GENERAL

03:12:48.223 --> 03:12:49.691

ASKED TO DO- BUT WE STILL HAVE.

03:17:05.713 --> 03:17:07.982
SO MANY GAPS THAT NEED TO BE

03:17:08.049 --> 03:17:09.651
FILLED PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE

03:17:09.717 --> 03:17:10.718
WAY OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM IS SET

03:17:10.785 --> 03:17:12.453
UP. WE HAVE SOME MEANS WE HAVE

03:17:12.520 --> 03:17:13.688
OVER SIXTEEN DISTRICTS IN SANTA

03:17:13.755 --> 03:17:16.724
CLARA COUNTY. ALONE UNDER THE

KIND OF. KEEP EVERYTHING- OF

03:17:25.600 --> 03:17:26.968
THE TOTAL HE SAID WHICH ISN'T

03:17:27.035 --> 03:17:30.405
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DO- AND

03:17:30.471 --> 03:17:30.872
ALTHOUGH WE ABSOLUTELY

03:17:30.939 --> 03:17:32.907
APPRECIATE. OF OUR PRIVATE

03:17:32.974 --> 03:17:35.677
SECTOR PARTNERS AND YOU KNOW

03:17:35.743 --> 03:17:36.644
EIGHTEEN TO FOR EXAMPLE DID

03:17:36.711 --> 03:17:39.180
DONATE HOTSPOT DEVICES. THEY'RE

03:17:39.247 --> 03:17:39.747
STILL COST TWENTY DOLLARS A

03:17:39.814 --> 03:17:42.450
MONTH FOR SERVICE. THAT FALLS

03:17:42.517 --> 03:17:44.185
ON. THE BOARD EDUCATION

03:17:44.252 --> 03:17:45.653
DISTRICTS THE PARTNERS THE

FAMILY SOMEONE'S GOING TO PAY

03:17:46.854 --> 03:17:49.090
FOR THAT. AND IF YOU HAVE

03:17:49.157 --> 03:17:50.091
MULTIPLE CHILDREN LIVING IN THE

03:17:50.158 --> 03:17:51.426
HOUSEHOLD. THAT WOULD NEED

03:17:51.492 --> 03:17:53.995
MULTIPLE HOTSPOTS YOU CAN SEE

03:17:54.062 --> 03:17:54.729
THE PICTURE THAT'S BEEN PAINTED

03:17:54.796 --> 03:17:57.498
RIGHT NOW- IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS

03:17:57.565 --> 03:17:59.834
IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO. I

03:17:59.901 --> 03:18:02.470
MENTION THIS BECAUSE- I THINK

03:18:02.537 --> 03:18:05.306

ALL THREE. OF OUR OUR PANELS-

03:18:08.209 --> 03:18:09.777
THAT THE SITUATION IS VERY DIRE

03:18:09.844 --> 03:18:12.180
WE KNOW. TO SOME EXTENT OF THE

03:18:12.247 --> 03:18:13.448
THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE BUT

03:18:13.514 --> 03:18:14.949
THE SCALE OF WHAT HAS TO BE

03:18:15.016 --> 03:18:17.051
DONE IS A NORMA'S. ENDED CHAU

03:18:17.118 --> 03:18:18.853
DONALD POINT EARLIER WE'RE THE

03:18:18.920 --> 03:18:20.922
ONES I GOTTA FIND A WAY. TO FIX

03:18:20.989 --> 03:18:23.424
IT THE BEST THAT WE CAN- BUT

03:18:23.491 --> 03:18:26.494
THE ANSWERS THE DISTRICTS THE

03:18:26.561 --> 03:18:28.563
YOU KNOW I KNOW CERTAINLY OUR

03:18:28.630 --> 03:18:30.431
OFFICE EDUCATION IS. ANOTHER

03:18:30.498 --> 03:18:33.601
DESPERATELY ASKING FOR HELP AND

03:18:33.668 --> 03:18:35.036
I KNOW ALL OF US HERE COMMITTED

03:18:35.103 --> 03:18:36.771
TO TRY TO GET THAT HELP. BUT I

03:18:36.838 --> 03:18:38.773
THINK THAT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE

03:18:38.840 --> 03:18:40.975
THE SCALE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:18:41.042 --> 03:18:42.510
IS BEYOND ANYTHING THAT ANY OF

03:18:42.577 --> 03:18:43.945
US TO FACE JUST LIKE SO MANY

03:18:44.012 --> 03:18:44.545
OTHER THINGS HAPPENING DURING

03:18:44.612 --> 03:18:45.880
THIS PANDEMIC. BUT IT GOES

03:18:45.947 --> 03:18:47.815
BEYOND THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE

03:18:47.882 --> 03:18:49.584
WE'VE GOT TO CREATE THESE AFTER

03:18:49.651 --> 03:18:51.552
WE HAVE TO CREATE THIS ACCESS

03:18:51.619 --> 03:18:53.888
FAR BEYOND. OF WHAT WHEN WERE A

03:18:53.955 --> 03:18:55.957
PATHOGENIC WHENEVER WITH THAT

03:18:56.024 --> 03:18:58.793
MAY BE OF THE BECAUSE AGAIN

03:18:58.860 --> 03:19:00.128
EVEN IN SILICON VALLEY I HAVE

03:19:00.194 --> 03:19:01.629
FAR TOO MANY CHILDREN. THAT

03:19:01.696 --> 03:19:03.398
HAVE NO OR VERY LITTLE

03:19:03.464 --> 03:19:06.934
OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE- OF THE

03:19:07.001 --> 03:19:08.503
PUTTING TOO MUCH ON THE SCHOOL

03:19:08.569 --> 03:19:09.937
TO TRY TO FIX THESE GAPS ARE

03:19:10.004 --> 03:19:11.939
NOT THE FAULT OF THE SCHOOL SO

03:19:12.006 --> 03:19:13.241
ANYWAY THAT'S THE ONLY MY

03:19:13.308 --> 03:19:15.076
CLOSING. STATEMENT AS WELL

03:19:15.143 --> 03:19:16.444
MISTER CHAIRMAN I WOULD JUST

03:19:16.511 --> 03:19:17.345
THINK YOU LISTEN TO SOME OF THE

03:19:17.412 --> 03:19:19.180
COMMENTS I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE

03:19:19.247 --> 03:19:21.516
THAT- FOLKS KNOW THAT WHETHER

03:19:21.582 --> 03:19:23.051
IT'S A RULE. OR IN THE HEART OF

03:19:23.117 --> 03:19:24.986
SILICON VALLEY THESE PROBLEMS

03:19:25.053 --> 03:19:27.922
ARE DIRE AND WE REALLY NEED TO

03:19:27.989 --> 03:19:28.523
DO EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN AND

03:19:28.589 --> 03:19:34.762
THE WEEKS AND MONTHS. AHEAD

03:19:34.829 --> 03:19:35.730
JUST TAKE A POINT OF PERSONAL

03:19:35.797 --> 03:19:36.931
PRIVILEGE HERE WOULD.

03:19:36.998 --> 03:19:37.965
ENCOURAGED BECAUSE- NOT FOR

03:19:38.032 --> 03:19:38.733
PROFIT SO I WOULD I WOULD URGE

TO IMPORT ISSUES THIS SILENT.

03:19:41.836 --> 03:19:43.538
BUT AT THE POINT OF PERSONAL

03:19:43.604 --> 03:19:44.405
PRIVILEGE AND I DON'T LIKE THE

03:19:44.472 --> 03:19:45.673

GOVERNMENT IS TO CHIP IN WITH A

03:19:54.749 --> 03:19:56.818
SERVICE PROVIDERS NEED TO CHIP

ME AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR

03:22:37.545 --> 03:22:40.448
QUESTION- THE CALIFORNIA

03:22:40.515 --> 03:22:43.084
ADVANCED SERVICES FUND PROGRAM-

03:22:43.150 --> 03:22:44.685
IS BEING FULLY IMPLEMENTED BY

03:22:44.752 --> 03:22:46.354
THE COMMISSION WEEK FACT THAT

03:22:46.420 --> 03:22:47.388
THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE

03:22:47.455 --> 03:22:49.891
OUT OF RESOURCES HERE'S THEM SO

03:22:49.957 --> 03:22:51.425
CLEARLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

03:22:51.492 --> 03:22:53.194
THEY WILL BE A NEED TO HAVE

03:22:53.261 --> 03:22:55.196
WILL BE ADDITIONAL FUNDING-

03:22:55.263 --> 03:22:57.632
HOWEVER WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THE

03:22:57.698 --> 03:22:59.500
POLICYMAKERS TO CONSIDER

03:22:59.567 --> 03:23:02.069
IDENTIFYING A LONG TERM FUNDING

03:23:02.136 --> 03:23:04.238
SOURCES THAT WOULD SUPPORT NOT

03:23:04.305 --> 03:23:06.107
JUST BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT BUT

03:23:06.173 --> 03:23:08.342
BROADBAND ADOPTION AND DIGITAL

03:23:08.409 --> 03:23:10.411
LITERACY WOULD BE THE NEXT TWO

03:23:10.478 --> 03:23:13.714
CATEGORIES I WOULD. MOVE TO AND

03:23:13.781 --> 03:23:14.949
IN THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT

03:23:15.016 --> 03:23:17.051
IN FINDING THE PROGRAM LONG

03:23:17.118 --> 03:23:19.086
TERM CARE WITH THEIR CHARGE IS

03:23:19.153 --> 03:23:20.955
IN THE BEST INTERESTS TO HAVE

03:23:21.022 --> 03:23:22.957
AS A CALIFORNIANS THE AND WILL

03:23:23.024 --> 03:23:25.660
ULTIMATELY GET THE JOB DONE AND

03:23:25.726 --> 03:23:27.662
THEN MY THIRD ISSUE I WOULD

03:23:27.728 --> 03:23:29.697
INCLUDE IN THAT IS THAT THERE

03:23:29.764 --> 03:23:31.299
NEEDS TO BE NUMBER FARMS

03:23:31.365 --> 03:23:33.968
RELATED TO- THE CHALLENGES THAT

03:23:34.035 --> 03:23:35.136
WE'RE FACING WITH REGARDS TO

03:23:35.202 --> 03:23:36.871
PERMITTING PROJECTS ARE TAKING

03:23:36.938 --> 03:23:38.506
A VERY LONG TIME TO BE

03:23:38.573 --> 03:23:42.143
APPROVED- AT THE AT VARIOUS

03:23:42.209 --> 03:23:43.578
LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND THAT

03:23:43.644 --> 03:23:44.946
CLEARLY THERE'S SOMETHING THAT

03:23:45.012 --> 03:23:47.181
COULD BE DONE TO EXPEDITE THE

03:23:47.248 --> 03:23:52.753
DEPLOYMENT OF THE.

03:23:52.820 --> 03:23:54.689
INFRASTRUCTURE AND I BELIEVE

03:23:54.755 --> 03:23:56.090
THIS MISS A LITTLE WHO ASK FOR

03:23:56.157 --> 03:23:57.792
SOME COMMENTS RECOMMEND GARCIA.

03:23:57.858 --> 03:24:00.328

03:24:00.394 --> 03:24:01.462
ALL BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE OF ALL.

03:24:01.529 --> 03:24:09.670
THAT. KEEP IN MIND AS A DELAY

03:24:09.737 --> 03:24:10.972
SO WE'RE GONNA WAIT A COUPLE

03:24:11.038 --> 03:24:11.505
SECONDS EVERY TIME I ASK

03:24:11.572 --> 03:24:13.341

THAT MAYBE SURE THREE AREAS

03:24:28.055 --> 03:24:30.358
THAT HE WOULD- SUGGEST US

03:24:30.424 --> 03:24:32.460
MOVING FORWARD AS IMPROVEMENTS

03:24:32.526 --> 03:24:35.596

03:25:16.237 --> 03:25:17.471
LOT OF APPROACHES MANY

03:25:17.538 --> 03:25:18.039
DIFFERENT APPROACHES WE ARE

03:25:18.105 --> 03:25:19.707
VERY DIVERSE STATE AND SO

03:25:19.774 --> 03:25:21.776
MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T LOOK

03:25:21.842 --> 03:25:23.744
TO TRADITIONAL WAYS AND METHODS

03:25:23.811 --> 03:25:25.046
OF SOLVING THIS SOLUTION BUT

03:25:25.112 --> 03:25:28.449
THAT WE REALLY- OPEN BE OPEN TO

03:25:28.516 --> 03:25:30.317

THIS IT'S THE PARTNERSHIP. THAT

03:25:43.464 --> 03:25:46.133
ACTUALLY MAKES THIS WORK SO-

03:25:46.200 --> 03:25:48.402
AND THAT WOULD BE MY INITIAL-

03:25:48.469 --> 03:25:50.071
