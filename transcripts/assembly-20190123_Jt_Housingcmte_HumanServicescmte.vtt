THE VA AND THE U. S. INTERAGENCY

00:40:30.294 --> 00:40:31.796
COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS AMONGST

00:40:31.862 --> 00:40:32.530
OTHERS.

00:40:32.596 --> 00:40:33.731
HAVE COME TO RECOGNIZE THAT

00:40:33.798 --> 00:40:35.966
HOMELESSNESS IS A HOUSING ISSUE

00:40:36.033 --> 00:40:38.202
THAT HAS PROVEN SOLUTIONS THAT

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:39.503
CAN EN PEOPLE'S HOMELESSNESS

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:41.505
QUICKLY AND EFFECTIVELY.

00:40:41.572 --> 00:40:43.474
EVEN IN A VERY EXPENSIVE HOUSING

00:40:43.541 --> 00:40:45.943
MARKET AND TRIES TO FIND THOSE

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:47.077
SOLUTIONS.

00:40:47.144 --> 00:40:48.679
THE STATE ALSO HAS A KEY ROLE TO

00:40:48.746 --> 00:40:49.547
PLAY IN IMPLEMENTING THE

00:40:49.613 --> 00:40:50.948
SOLUTIONS AND ENSURING THAT

00:40:51.015 --> 00:40:52.716
THESE VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS

00:40:52.783 --> 00:40:53.884
HAVE HOMES.

00:40:53.951 --> 00:40:55.219
AND THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:56.854
STAY THERE THE STATE SENATE'S

00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:58.255
LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE HAS

00:40:58.322 --> 00:41:00.524
BEEN CRITICAL AND IS APPRECIATED.

00:41:00.591 --> 00:41:02.393
WE KNOW THE LIVES IT WILL SAVE

00:41:02.459 --> 00:41:03.761
AND THE FAMILIES IT WILL MAKE

00:41:03.828 --> 00:41:05.830
HOLE WE KNOW THE TAX PAYERS

00:41:05.896 --> 00:41:07.264
DOLLARS THAT WILL BE FREED UP.

00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:08.833
AND WE KNOW THE HEALTH IT WILL

00:41:08.899 --> 00:41:11.268
BRING BACK TO CAL TODAY I'M

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:12.903
GOING TO BRIEFLY TALK ABOUT THE

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:14.104
NATIONAL TRENDS AND HOMELESSNESS

00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:16.106
WERE CALIFORNIA STANDS IN REGARD

00:41:16.173 --> 00:41:17.041
TO THE NATION.

00:41:17.107 --> 00:41:18.209
AND KEY SOLUTIONS TO

00:41:18.275 --> 00:41:19.343
HOMELESSNESS WITHIN WHICH I WILL

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:20.978
DISCUSS TO CRUCIAL AREAS OF

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:22.880
ACTIVITIES HOUSING AND A LOCAL

00:41:22.947 --> 00:41:25.082
SYSTEMIC HOMES CRISIS RESPONSE

00:41:25.149 --> 00:41:26.383
SYSTEM.

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:28.619
SO FIRST WHERE DO WE STAND ON

00:41:28.686 --> 00:41:29.854
HOMELESSNESS NATIONALLY.

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:31.121
HOMELESSNESS IS A COMMON

00:41:31.188 --> 00:41:32.890
PHENOMENON IN THE NATION AS IT

00:41:32.957 --> 00:41:34.859
IS HERE IN CALIFORNIA OUR MOST

00:41:34.925 --> 00:41:37.294
RECENT NUMBERS ARE FROM.

00:41:37.361 --> 00:41:38.262
TWENTY EIGHTEEN NATIONALLY FIVE

00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:40.331
AND 520-008-0030 PEOPLE ARE

00:41:40.397 --> 00:41:42.032
HOMELESS ON A GIVEN NIGHT A

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:43.667
POINT IN TIME.

00:41:43.734 --> 00:41:44.969
HOW'S THAT BROKEN DOWN.

00:41:45.035 --> 00:41:47.504
A THIRD OR ABOUT 35% OF PEOPLE

00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:49.373
ARE ON SHELTER NATIONALLY AND

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.709
MOST TWO THIRDS OR INDIVIDUAL

00:41:51.775 --> 00:41:54.245
HOMELESS ADULTS. 33% OF HOMES

00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:56.747
PEOPLE ARE IN FAMILIES AND 16%

00:41:56.814 --> 00:41:58.082
ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS

00:41:58.148 --> 00:41:59.583
INDIVIDUALS NATIONALLY.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:01.352
THE MOST DRAMATIC DECREASES IN

00:42:01.418 --> 00:42:02.620
HOMELESSNESS HAVE BEEN AMONG

00:42:02.686 --> 00:42:03.954
VETERANS AND CHRONICALLY

00:42:04.021 --> 00:42:05.089
HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS.

00:42:05.155 --> 00:42:06.690
SINCE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT

00:42:06.757 --> 00:42:09.193
VETERANS HAS DECREASED BY 38%

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.728
AND CHRONICALLY HOMES

00:42:10.794 --> 00:42:12.062
INDIVIDUALS BY 26%.

00:42:12.129 --> 00:42:13.397
THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN DECREASES

00:42:13.464 --> 00:42:16.533
AND ALMOST EVERY SUBPOPULATION

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:17.902
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:42:17.968 --> 00:42:18.535
SIZEABLE FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN

00:42:18.602 --> 00:42:20.237
THOSE PARTICULAR POPULATIONS

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:21.505
OTHER REASON FOR THOSE MAJOR TO

00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:23.507
CLIENTS AS WELL AS INCREASINGLY

00:42:23.574 --> 00:42:25.976
SMART COORDINATED APPROACHES.

00:42:26.043 --> 00:42:27.478
FOR THIS AND OTHER REASONS THE

00:42:27.544 --> 00:42:28.812
ALLIANCE HAS RECENTLY TURNED

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:30.547
MUCH OF ITS FOCUS TO CREATING A

00:42:30.614 --> 00:42:31.882
FRAMEWORK TO TARGET MORE

00:42:31.949 --> 00:42:34.251
RESOURCES TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS

00:42:34.318 --> 00:42:35.586
AMONGST OF EACH INDIVIDUAL

00:42:35.653 --> 00:42:36.553
ADULTS.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.122
AS THIS IS THE LARGEST PERCENT

00:42:38.188 --> 00:42:39.590
OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION AND

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:41.558
HAS THE SMALLEST AMOUNT OF

00:42:41.625 --> 00:42:42.860
RESOURCES DEVOTED TO THEM.

00:42:42.927 --> 00:42:43.928
WE ENCOURAGE CALIFORNIA TO LOOK

00:42:43.994 --> 00:42:46.563
CLOSELY AT THIS RESPONDING

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:48.365
RESOURCES AS WELL SINCE THERE IS

00:42:48.432 --> 00:42:50.501
A SIMILAR PICTURE HERE.

00:42:50.567 --> 00:42:51.969
WELL HOMELESSNESS IS STILL A

00:42:52.036 --> 00:42:53.270
CRISIS THE OVERALL HOMES

00:42:53.337 --> 00:42:55.039
POPULATION HAS ACTUALLY BEEN

00:42:55.105 --> 00:42:56.740
DECREASING STEADILY OVER THE

00:42:56.807 --> 00:42:57.908
LAST FEW YEARS NATIONALLY.

00:42:57.975 --> 00:43:00.110
HAS DECREASED THIRTEEN POINT 6%

00:43:00.177 --> 00:43:01.312
IN THE LAST DECADE.

00:43:01.378 --> 00:43:02.680
THOUGH THERE WAS A SLIGHT UPTICK

00:43:02.746 --> 00:43:04.682
ABOUT LESS THAN 1% IN THE LAST

00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:06.116
YEAR LOT OF THAT COMES FROM

00:43:06.183 --> 00:43:07.251
CALIFORNIA.

00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:09.553
SO WHY HAS HOMES HAS GENERALLY

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:10.988
BEEN GOING DOWN NATIONALLY.

00:43:11.055 --> 00:43:12.623
FUNDAMENTALLY THE FIELD HAS

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:14.858
GOTTEN SMARTER ABOUT HOW TO HELP

00:43:14.925 --> 00:43:16.427
PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS

00:43:16.493 --> 00:43:18.195
FEDERAL PROGRAMS HAVE FOCUSED ON

00:43:18.262 --> 00:43:19.830
INVESTING IN PROVEN AND

00:43:19.897 --> 00:43:21.098
PERMANENT HOUSING ORIENTED

00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:21.865
SOLUTIONS.

00:43:21.932 --> 00:43:23.600
CORD NEEDED CRISIS RESPONSE

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:26.070
SYSTEMS USING DATA BETTER AND

00:43:26.136 --> 00:43:28.038
FIGURING OUT HOW TO GET PEOPLE

00:43:28.105 --> 00:43:29.807
BACK INTO HOUSING FASTER.

00:43:29.873 --> 00:43:30.874
AND AS WE'VE BEEN MORE

00:43:30.941 --> 00:43:32.676
SUCCESSFUL WE'VE ATTRACTED MORE

00:43:32.743 --> 00:43:34.878
FEDERAL INVESTMENT UNLIKE MOST

00:43:34.945 --> 00:43:36.447
SOCIAL ISSUES.

00:43:36.513 --> 00:43:37.848
AS THE PROBLEM HOMES HAS HAS

00:43:37.915 --> 00:43:39.416
GOTTEN SMALLER THE FEDERAL MONEY

00:43:39.483 --> 00:43:40.985
FOR HOMES IS ACTUALLY GENERALLY

00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:42.820
GOTTEN BIGGER AND THE GOVERNMENT

00:43:42.886 --> 00:43:44.088
HAS INVESTED IN THE STRATEGIES

00:43:44.154 --> 00:43:45.889
BECAUSE THEY ARE ACTUALLY

00:43:45.956 --> 00:43:47.624
WORKING TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS.

00:43:47.691 --> 00:43:49.059
HOUSING AFFORDABILITY IS THE

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:50.661
MAJOR DRIVER OF HOMELESSNESS

00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:51.628
ACROSS THE NATION AND HERE IN

00:43:51.695 --> 00:43:53.764
CALIFORNIA FAR TOO MANY PEOPLE

00:43:53.831 --> 00:43:55.065
SPEND FAR TOO MUCH OF THEIR

00:43:55.132 --> 00:43:56.433
INCOME ON RENT.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.002
ACCORDING TO RESEARCHERS AREAS

00:43:58.068 --> 00:43:59.903
WITH GROWING NUMBERS OF COST

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:01.805
BURDEN HOUSEHOLDS CAN EXPECT

00:44:01.872 --> 00:44:03.240
INCREASES AND HOMELESSNESS.

00:44:03.307 --> 00:44:05.943
THESE PLACES ARE OFTEN CITIES.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:07.177
SO HOW DOES CALIFORNIA COMPARED

00:44:07.244 --> 00:44:08.212
TO OTHER STATES AND TO THE

00:44:08.278 --> 00:44:09.913
NATIONAL TRENDS.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.648
CALIFORNIA AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW

00:44:11.715 --> 00:44:13.217
HAS MORE PEOPLE HOMELESS PEOPLE

00:44:13.283 --> 00:44:14.084
THAN ANY OTHER STATE AND THE

00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.085
NATION.

00:44:15.152 --> 00:44:16.453
AND OF VERY HIGH PERCENTAGE OF

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:18.155
THEM ARE ON SHELTERED MAINLY

00:44:18.222 --> 00:44:20.224
LIVE OUTSIDE IN PLACE IS NOT

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:22.192
MEANT FOR HUMAN HABITATION. 20%

00:44:22.259 --> 00:44:23.260
OF THE NATION'S HOMELESS PEOPLE

00:44:23.327 --> 00:44:25.996
LIVE IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT A

00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:26.563
HUNDRED TWENTY NINE THOUSAND

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:27.664
PEOPLE AT A POINT IN TIME.

00:44:27.731 --> 00:44:28.866
AMONG THE SUBPOPULATIONS OF

00:44:28.932 --> 00:44:30.567
HOMELESS PEOPLE CALIFORNIA HAS

00:44:30.634 --> 00:44:32.169
THE MOST ON CHILDREN HOMELESS

00:44:32.236 --> 00:44:34.772
PEOPLE OF ANY STATE NEARLY

00:44:34.838 --> 00:44:36.407
NINETY THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE 69%

00:44:36.473 --> 00:44:37.508
OF CALIFORNIA.

00:44:37.574 --> 00:44:38.842
CALIFORNIA'S HOMES POPULATION IS

00:44:38.909 --> 00:44:42.479
ON SHELTER THIRTEEN TO TWENTY

00:44:42.546 --> 00:44:43.080
EIGHTEEN THE LAST FIVE YEARS

00:44:43.147 --> 00:44:44.481
OVERALL HOMELESSNESS DECREASE

00:44:44.548 --> 00:44:46.483
NATIONALLY BY ABOUT 6% INCREASE

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:49.053
IN CALIFORNIA BY ABOUT 9%.

00:44:49.119 --> 00:44:50.687
HOWEVER IN THAT SAME FIVE YEARS

00:44:50.754 --> 00:44:52.523
FAMILY HOMELESSNESS DECREASED

00:44:52.589 --> 00:44:54.291
NATIONALLY BY 21% AND IN

00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:56.260
CALIFORNIA FAMILY HOMES IS

00:44:56.326 --> 00:44:59.463
ACTUALLY ALSO DECREASED BY 19% --

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:00.964
AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT LATER

00:45:01.031 --> 00:45:02.099
ABOUT HOW THAT SEEMS TO REALLY

00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:03.767
COINCIDE WITH THE INCREASED

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:06.203
INVESTMENT AND RAPID RE HOUSING

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:07.638
ESPECIALLY AT THE HSP PROGRAM.

00:45:07.704 --> 00:45:09.406
SO CALIFORNIA DOES HAVE A

00:45:09.473 --> 00:45:10.674
BECOMES POPULATION IN MAKING A

00:45:10.741 --> 00:45:13.343
DENT HERE WILL MAKE A BIG DENT

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:15.012
OVERALL IN THE NATION.

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:15.546
NOW ON TO DISCUSSING THE

00:45:15.612 --> 00:45:16.647
SOLUTIONS TO HOMELESSNESS THAT

00:45:16.713 --> 00:45:18.649
WE KNOW ARE WORKING NATIONALLY

00:45:18.715 --> 00:45:20.617
AS WELL AS IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW

00:45:20.684 --> 00:45:21.985
FEDERAL AND STATE PROGRAMS

00:45:22.052 --> 00:45:23.220
RESPOND.

00:45:23.287 --> 00:45:24.488
FROM CAREFUL RESEARCH THE

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:26.123
EXPERIENCE OF LEADING

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.425
COMMUNITIES AND GROWING AND A

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:29.893
GROWING POOL OF NATIONAL DATA.

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:31.228
THE KEY ELEMENTS OF A SUCCESSFUL

00:45:31.295 --> 00:45:32.863
APPROACH TO ENDING HOMES AS HAVE

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:34.231
BECOME CLEAR.

00:45:34.298 --> 00:45:35.632
THERE ARE TWO CRUCIAL AREAS OF

00:45:35.699 --> 00:45:37.534
ACTIVITIES AND BOTH ARE

00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:39.536
ESSENTIAL TO MAKING A LASTING

00:45:39.603 --> 00:45:40.370
IMPACT ON HOMELESSNESS AND

00:45:40.437 --> 00:45:42.873
CREATING GOOD SYSTEM FLOW.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:43.941
WHICH MEANS MOVING PEOPLE

00:45:44.007 --> 00:45:45.843
QUICKLY FROM HOMELESSNESS TO

00:45:45.909 --> 00:45:46.910
HOUSING.

00:45:46.977 --> 00:45:48.745
NUMBER ONE HAVING LOCAL

00:45:48.812 --> 00:45:50.347
COORDINATED DATA DRIVEN HOMELESS

00:45:50.414 --> 00:45:52.249
CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEMS THAT USE

00:45:52.316 --> 00:45:53.650
A SYSTEMIC RESPONSE TO

00:45:53.717 --> 00:45:55.586
HOMELESSNESS THAT IS ENTIRELY

00:45:55.652 --> 00:45:57.921
FOCUSED ON RE HOUSING PEOPLE.

00:45:57.988 --> 00:45:59.590
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND

00:45:59.656 --> 00:46:01.158
DIVERTING PEOPLE FROM

00:46:01.225 --> 00:46:03.060
HOMELESSNESS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:46:03.127 --> 00:46:03.994
IN OTHER WORDS YOU HAVE TO HAVE

00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:05.028
A HOMELESS CRISIS RESPONSE

00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:06.463
SYSTEM IN PLACE THAT IF YOU ARE

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:08.198
ABOUT TO BECOME HOMELESS OR YOU

00:46:08.265 --> 00:46:09.933
BECOME HOMELESS YOU CAN BE

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.001
IDENTIFIED.

00:46:11.068 --> 00:46:13.070
KEPT SAFE AND THEN QUICKLY MOVED

00:46:13.137 --> 00:46:14.805
BACK INTO HOUSING.

00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:16.473
AND SECOND HAVING HOUSING

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:18.008
RESPONSE SYSTEM THAT MAKES

00:46:18.075 --> 00:46:19.810
HOUSING MORE FOR AFFORDABLE OVER

00:46:19.877 --> 00:46:22.045
ALL SEE PEOPLE HAVE HOUSING TO

00:46:22.112 --> 00:46:23.714
GO TO AND CAN MAINTAIN THAT

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:24.681
HOUSING.

00:46:24.748 --> 00:46:25.949
WILL START THE SECOND AREA

00:46:26.016 --> 00:46:28.252
HOUSING. THREE BASIC THINGS WE

00:46:28.318 --> 00:46:29.486
NEED FOR HOUSING ARE.

00:46:29.553 --> 00:46:30.487
RENT SUBSIDIES TO THE PEOPLE

00:46:30.554 --> 00:46:33.357
WITH VERY LOW RENT.

00:46:33.423 --> 00:46:34.825
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT FUNDING SO

00:46:34.892 --> 00:46:36.093
THAT MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS ARE

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.427
AVAILABLE.

00:46:37.494 --> 00:46:39.062
AND REASONABLE POLICIES

00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:40.497
REGARDING LAND USE AND ZONING

00:46:40.564 --> 00:46:41.431
THAT ALLOW FOR DIVERSE

00:46:41.498 --> 00:46:43.400
COMMUNITIES.

00:46:43.467 --> 00:46:45.135
FEDERALLY SECTION EIGHT PUBLIC

00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:46.203
HOUSING OTHER HAD HOUSING

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:48.238
PROGRAMS FUN THESE ACTIVITIES

00:46:48.305 --> 00:46:49.873
HOWEVER THEY ARE NOT FUNDED

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.275
ANYWHERE NEAR THE LEVELS THAT

00:46:51.341 --> 00:46:52.276
ARE NEEDED.

00:46:52.342 --> 00:46:54.645
ONLY ABOUT 25% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:46:54.711 --> 00:46:56.380
ELIGIBLE FOR THIS TYPE OF

00:46:56.446 --> 00:46:58.415
PERMANENT RENT SUBSIDY.

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:00.150
EVER RECEIVE A VOUCHER.

00:47:00.217 --> 00:47:01.251
THAT INVESTMENT HAS BEEN

00:47:01.318 --> 00:47:02.252
DECREASING OVER TIME AT THE

00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:03.954
FEDERAL LEVELS.

00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:05.155
NEXT I'LL SPEND THE REST OF MY

00:47:05.222 --> 00:47:06.723
TIME DISCUSSING THE SECOND AREA

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.225
OF ACTIVITIES THE COORDINATED

00:47:08.292 --> 00:47:10.427
HOMELESS CRISIS RESPONSE SYSTEM.

00:47:10.494 --> 00:47:11.295
THIS AREA OF ACTIVITIES

00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:13.096
FEDERALLY FUNDED BY THE HARD

00:47:13.163 --> 00:47:14.865
CONTINUUM OF CARE PROGRAM BUT

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:17.000
ALSO LEAVES GAPS THAT LOCALITIES

00:47:17.067 --> 00:47:18.402
HAVE TO FILL.

00:47:18.468 --> 00:47:19.636
WHY IS A SYSTEMIC APPROACH

00:47:19.703 --> 00:47:21.471
CRUCIAL THE APPROACH TO

00:47:21.538 --> 00:47:22.940
HOMELESSNESS HAS FUNDAMENTALLY

00:47:23.006 --> 00:47:24.441
SHIFTED OVER THE PAST TWO

00:47:24.508 --> 00:47:25.142
DECADES?

00:47:25.209 --> 00:47:27.377
WHERE EFFORTS OF THE PREVIOUS

00:47:27.444 --> 00:47:28.412
TWENTY YEARS WERE MARKED BY

00:47:28.478 --> 00:47:30.480
INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS WORKING TO

00:47:30.547 --> 00:47:31.582
MANAGE THE PROBLEM OF

00:47:31.648 --> 00:47:33.650
HOMELESSNESS THE SYSTEMIC

00:47:33.717 --> 00:47:35.552
COORDINATED APPROACH SEEKS TO

00:47:35.619 --> 00:47:37.721
SOLVE THE PROBLEM PERMANENTLY?

00:47:37.788 --> 00:47:39.056
AND TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE

00:47:39.122 --> 00:47:40.257
NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING

00:47:40.324 --> 00:47:41.658
HOMELESSNESS.

00:47:41.725 --> 00:47:43.093
THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.395
THE SYSTEMIC APPROACH ARE USING

00:47:45.462 --> 00:47:47.130
HOUSING FIRST INTERVENTIONS AND

00:47:47.197 --> 00:47:49.499
HAVING A STRATEGIC SYSTEMIC

00:47:49.566 --> 00:47:50.567
RESPONSE THAT INVOLVES

00:47:50.634 --> 00:47:53.537
PARTNERSHIP AT ALL LEVELS CITY

00:47:53.604 --> 00:47:55.806
COUNTY STATE AND FEDERAL.

00:47:55.872 --> 00:47:56.974
NOT MISSING THE PEOPLE

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.242
EXPERIENCING HOMES IS HAVE LOTS

00:47:58.308 --> 00:47:59.910
OF PROBLEMS AND HAVE SERVICE

00:47:59.977 --> 00:48:02.346
NEEDS HOMES THIS IS FIRST AND

00:48:02.412 --> 00:48:04.581
FOREMOST HOUSING CRISIS.

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:05.649
THIS THE FEDERALRESPONSE

00:48:05.716 --> 00:48:07.317
INVESTS IN THE SOLUTIONS THAT

00:48:07.384 --> 00:48:09.253
WORK TO HOUSE PEOPLE QUICKLY

00:48:09.319 --> 00:48:10.854
WERE DIVERT PEOPLE FROM IMMINENT

00:48:10.921 --> 00:48:11.855
HOMELESSNESS.

00:48:11.922 --> 00:48:13.690
WHY COMMUNITIES WITH THE BEST

00:48:13.757 --> 00:48:15.792
RESULTS HAVE AN INTENSE FOCUS ON

00:48:15.859 --> 00:48:17.060
HOUSING PEOPLE AS QUICKLY AS

00:48:17.127 --> 00:48:19.096
POSSIBLE WE SEE THAT ACROSS THE

00:48:19.162 --> 00:48:20.764
COUNTRY AND WE SEE THAT AND

00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:21.365
COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA AS

00:48:21.431 --> 00:48:22.366
WELL?

00:48:22.432 --> 00:48:23.967
THE HOUSING FIRST APPROACHED.

00:48:24.034 --> 00:48:25.569
HELPING A HOMELESS PERSON MOVING

00:48:25.636 --> 00:48:28.839
TO HOUSE OTHER HELP ONCE THE

00:48:28.905 --> 00:48:30.107
PERSON IS HOUSED.

00:48:30.173 --> 00:48:32.009
HAS PROVEN TO GET BETTER RESULTS

00:48:32.075 --> 00:48:34.478
AT LESS COST WE'VE SEEN TONS OF

00:48:34.544 --> 00:48:35.746
RESEARCH ON THIS OVER THE YEARS

00:48:35.812 --> 00:48:37.347
SO WHAT IS HOUSING FIRST MEAN

00:48:37.414 --> 00:48:38.682
OPERATIONALLY.

00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:39.950
WE RECOMMEND TO PARTICULARLY

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:41.451
IMPORTANT MODELS THAT USE THIS

00:48:41.518 --> 00:48:42.386
APPROACH.

00:48:42.452 --> 00:48:43.820
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND

00:48:43.887 --> 00:48:45.289
RAPID RE HOUSING I WILL TOTAL

00:48:45.355 --> 00:48:46.356
ABOUT THESE INTERVENTIONS AND

00:48:46.423 --> 00:48:48.558
HOW TO EFFECTIVELY TARGET THESE

00:48:48.625 --> 00:48:49.126
RESOURCES TO THE PEOPLE THAT

00:48:49.192 --> 00:48:50.060
NEED THEM --

00:48:50.127 --> 00:48:51.295
AND I SEE THAT IN THE IN YOUR

00:48:51.361 --> 00:48:52.696
PAPER YOU ALSO HAVE A LOT OF

00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:54.331
DETAIL ABOUT THAT SOME HAPPENING

00:48:54.398 --> 00:48:55.232
ANSWER QUESTIONS. FOR

00:48:55.299 --> 00:48:56.400
CHRONICALLY HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT

00:48:56.466 --> 00:48:58.502
MARCH SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF

00:48:58.568 --> 00:49:00.270
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO

00:49:00.337 --> 00:49:01.705
HAVE BEEN HOMES FOR A LONG TIME

00:49:01.772 --> 00:49:03.540
IT'S A SMALLER PERCENT OF OF THE

00:49:03.607 --> 00:49:05.208
HOMELESS POPULATION HERE.

00:49:05.275 --> 00:49:07.344
PERMANENT HOUSING PARENTS WERE

00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:09.079
OF HOUSING IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION.

00:49:09.146 --> 00:49:10.514
WHEN IT IS AVAILABLE THAT IS A

00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.948
PERMANENT HOUSING SUBSIDY

00:49:12.015 --> 00:49:13.650
COUPLED WITH INTENSIVE SERVICES

00:49:13.717 --> 00:49:15.185
THAT ARE FOCUSED ON KEEPING

00:49:15.252 --> 00:49:16.253
PEOPLE HOUSED --

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.788
AND THEN CONNECTING WITH THEM

00:49:17.854 --> 00:49:19.589
WITH ANY TREATMENT SERVICES THEY

00:49:19.656 --> 00:49:20.991
MAY NEED TO STAY HOUSE FOR

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:22.225
PEOPLE WHO DON'T NEED PERMANENT

00:49:22.292 --> 00:49:23.293
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND THAT'S

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:24.428
MOST OTHER FOLKS.

00:49:24.494 --> 00:49:25.762
YOU STILL NEED OTHER HOUSING

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:27.264
STRATEGIES AND THOSE HOUSING

00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:29.366
STRATEGY SHOULD BE A COMBINATION

00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:30.901
OF CRISIS AND EMERGENCY BEDS

00:49:30.967 --> 00:49:33.136
RAPID RE HOUSING AND OTHER

00:49:33.203 --> 00:49:35.105
SUBSIDIZED HOUSING.

00:49:35.172 --> 00:49:36.740
WITH RESPECT TO CRISIS BEDS OR

00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:37.774
SHELTERS OR NAVIGATION CENTERS

00:49:37.841 --> 00:49:39.309
WE DO NEED SHELTER WE NEED

00:49:39.376 --> 00:49:40.711
CHILDREN CALIFORNIA PEOPLE

00:49:40.777 --> 00:49:42.679
SHOULD NOT LIVE ON THE STREETS

00:49:42.746 --> 00:49:44.348
INTENSE OR IN CARS.

00:49:44.414 --> 00:49:46.550
SHELTER ALONE IS NOT THE SOLE

00:49:46.616 --> 00:49:47.784
SOLUTION.

00:49:47.851 --> 00:49:49.152
TO BUT SHELTER IS NEEDED AS A

00:49:49.219 --> 00:49:50.387
PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO STAY BRIEFLY

00:49:50.454 --> 00:49:52.522
WHILE THAT SOLUTION HOUSING IS

00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:54.658
BEING ARRANGED TO BE EFFECTIVE

00:49:54.725 --> 00:49:56.560
SHELTER MUST BE LOW BARRIER AND

00:49:56.626 --> 00:49:58.995
HOUSING FOCUSED AND ACCESSIBLE

00:49:59.062 --> 00:50:00.063
TO ANYONE.

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:02.065
EXPERIENCING HOUSING CRISIS WITH

00:50:02.132 --> 00:50:03.967
LITTLE TO NO PRECONDITIONS IT IS

00:50:04.034 --> 00:50:05.602
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT A

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:06.803
RIGHT TO SHELTER DOES NOT EQUATE

00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:08.238
WITH THE RIGHT TO EXIT SHELTER

00:50:08.305 --> 00:50:09.606
TO HOUSING.

00:50:09.673 --> 00:50:11.241
HAVING THE HOUSING RESOURCES TO

00:50:11.308 --> 00:50:13.510
EXIT PEOPLE TO ARE CRUCIAL TO

00:50:13.577 --> 00:50:15.045
EFFECTIVE SHELTER DESIGN SO

00:50:15.112 --> 00:50:16.780
HOUSING SHELTER REALLY NEED TO

00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:18.048
GO TOGETHER.

00:50:18.115 --> 00:50:18.982
YOU CAN BILL MORE SOLDIER

00:50:19.049 --> 00:50:20.317
WITHOUT A HOUSING EXIT STRATEGY

00:50:20.384 --> 00:50:21.818
PEOPLE GET STUCK IN SHELTER FOR

00:50:21.885 --> 00:50:23.186
LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND YOU'LL

00:50:23.253 --> 00:50:24.388
JUST HAVE TO KEEP BUILDING MORE

00:50:24.454 --> 00:50:25.822
SOLDIERS BECAUSE I'LL JUST KEEP

00:50:25.889 --> 00:50:27.758
GETTING FALL.

00:50:27.824 --> 00:50:28.959
IF PEOPLE CAN GET OUT OF HOMES

00:50:29.025 --> 00:50:30.026
IS ON THEIR OWN AND DON'T NEED

00:50:30.093 --> 00:50:31.128
PERMITS PART OF HOUSING THEY

00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:32.596
SHOULD HAVE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO

00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:33.563
RAPIDLY HOUSING.

00:50:33.630 --> 00:50:34.664
RAPIDLY HOUSING IS ANOTHER

00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:37.100
HOUSING FOR A STRATEGY THAT ENDS

00:50:37.167 --> 00:50:38.535
A PERSON'S HOMES AS QUICKLY.

00:50:38.602 --> 00:50:39.603
BY USING IT IN LOOKS PENSIVE AND

00:50:39.669 --> 00:50:44.207
SHORTER ASSISTANCE AND SERVICES.

00:50:44.274 --> 00:50:45.709
THESE SORT OF SUBSIDIES RAPPER

00:50:45.776 --> 00:50:47.577
HOUSING WORK WELL EVEN IN VERY

00:50:47.644 --> 00:50:49.246
EXPENSIVE HOUSING MARKETS THE

00:50:49.312 --> 00:50:51.081
DATA SHOWS IS THAT AROUND THE

00:50:51.148 --> 00:50:52.516
COUNTRY AND IN CALIFORNIA.

00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:54.151
THESE PROGRAM SUCCEEDING QUICKLY

00:50:54.217 --> 00:50:55.419
HOUSING HOMELESS PEOPLE AND

00:50:55.485 --> 00:50:56.953
KEEPING THEM HOUSED AND THAT THE

00:50:57.020 --> 00:50:59.122
SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY DO NOT

00:50:59.189 --> 00:50:59.890
RETURN TO HOMELESSNESS IN THE

00:50:59.956 --> 00:51:00.757
NEAR TERM.

00:51:00.824 --> 00:51:02.225
WE ALSO SEE THAT RAPIDLY HOUSING

00:51:02.292 --> 00:51:03.994
IS MORE COST EFFECTIVE AND WORKS

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.495
BETTER THAN OTHER CRISIS

00:51:05.562 --> 00:51:07.097
INTERVENTIONS LIKE LONG SHELTER

00:51:07.164 --> 00:51:08.698
STAYS OR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING.

00:51:08.765 --> 00:51:10.367
I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT RAPIDLY

00:51:10.434 --> 00:51:12.102
HOUSING IS ABSOLUTELY GETTING

00:51:12.169 --> 00:51:13.837
HARDER TO DO EFFECTIVELY BECAUSE

00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:15.071
OF THE EXPENSE OF HOUSING

00:51:15.138 --> 00:51:16.339
MARKETS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:51:16.406 --> 00:51:18.041
I DON'T WANT TO PRETEND THAT

00:51:18.108 --> 00:51:20.677
THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY HARD WORK.

00:51:20.744 --> 00:51:22.245
HOWEVER THIS IS STILL THE BEST

00:51:22.312 --> 00:51:23.747
OPTION FOR MOST PEOPLE TO EXIT

00:51:23.814 --> 00:51:25.549
HOMELESSNESS WE HAVE TO HELP

00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:27.617
PEOPLE GET TO GET BACK INTO THE

00:51:27.684 --> 00:51:29.553
HOUSING MARKET THAT IS.

00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:31.021
NOT THE ONE WE WISH EXISTED

00:51:31.087 --> 00:51:32.355
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANOTHER

00:51:32.422 --> 00:51:34.624
CHOICE WE MUST CONTINUE TO FIND

00:51:34.691 --> 00:51:36.660
WAYS TO GIVE PEOPLE MORE TOOLS

00:51:36.726 --> 00:51:37.427
TO NAVIGATE THE HIGH COST OF

00:51:37.494 --> 00:51:38.495
HOUSING.

00:51:38.562 --> 00:51:40.030
PERHAPS INNOVATING BY OFFERING

00:51:40.096 --> 00:51:41.631
SURE HOUSING MODELS AN ON GOING

00:51:41.698 --> 00:51:42.933
CHAU SUBSIDIES.

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:44.434
THE HOME SYSTEM CANNOT SOLVE

00:51:44.501 --> 00:51:46.636
EVERYTHING IT ALONE DOESN'T HAVE

00:51:46.703 --> 00:51:48.071
THE POWER TO CHANGE THESE LARGER

00:51:48.138 --> 00:51:49.906
ECONOMIC FORCES AT PLAY SO WE

00:51:49.973 --> 00:51:50.674
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE CURRENT

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:51.741
HOUSING MARKET AND THESE

00:51:51.808 --> 00:51:53.243
SOLUTIONS ARE IN FACT WORKING IN

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:54.945
PARTS OF CALIFORNIA.

00:51:55.011 --> 00:51:55.979
THE DECREASE IN FAMILY HOMES AS

00:51:56.046 --> 00:51:57.714
APPEARS TO CORRELATE STRONGLY

00:51:57.781 --> 00:51:59.249
WITH A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN

00:51:59.316 --> 00:52:02.752
INVESTMENT AND RAPIDLY HOUSING

00:52:02.819 --> 00:52:04.488
FOR FAMILIES ACROSS THE STATE.

00:52:04.554 --> 00:52:05.088
FINALLY I'LL BRIEFLY MENTION

00:52:05.155 --> 00:52:06.256
PREVENTION THE FEDERAL PARTNERS

00:52:06.323 --> 00:52:07.190
ON HOMELESSNESS RECOMMEND A VERY

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:08.558
TARGETED FORMA PREVENTION CALL

00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:10.427
DIVERSION WHICH HELPS TO DIVERT

00:52:10.494 --> 00:52:11.862
PEOPLE WHO WERE LITERALLY

00:52:11.928 --> 00:52:13.230
KNOCKING ON THE SHELTER DOOR

00:52:13.296 --> 00:52:14.731
THEY NEED SHELTER TONIGHT.

00:52:14.798 --> 00:52:16.399
WE ALSO RECOMMEND IMPROVING

00:54:36.539 --> 00:54:38.642
AND THAT HAS ALLOWED THE ROLE IN

00:54:38.708 --> 00:54:41.478
SCOPE OF THE COUNCIL TO EXPAND --

00:54:41.544 --> 00:54:43.980

00:55:20.483 --> 00:55:22.185
SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIES AND

00:55:22.252 --> 00:55:25.255
PRIORITIES FOR THE COUNCIL.

00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:26.790
THERE IS AN INTERAGENCY WORKING

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:29.025

I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE HAS A

00:55:52.248 --> 00:55:54.284

01:20:38.633 --> 01:20:40.635
BAD AGES P. DOES FOLLOW HOUSING

01:20:40.702 --> 01:20:42.337
FIRST MODEL IT HAS BEEN DESIGNED

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:43.605

01:23:42.650 --> 01:23:45.387
COUNTIES PARTICIPATING IN THIS

01:23:45.453 --> 01:23:46.755
PROGRAM.

01:23:46.821 --> 01:23:47.389
STEP SERVES INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

HOMELESS CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS.

01:23:51.559 --> 01:23:53.027
GIVING HIGHEST PRIORITY TO THOSE

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:54.062
THAT ARE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS

01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:56.364
AND THOSE RELY MOST HEAVILY ON

01:23:56.431 --> 01:23:58.867
STATE AND COUNTY FUNDED SERVICES.

01:23:58.933 --> 01:23:59.901
THE PROGRAM CONSISTS OF FOUR

01:23:59.968 --> 01:24:01.536
CORE ELEMENTS.

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:02.871
OUT REACH INTENSIVE CASE

01:24:02.937 --> 01:24:04.372

SERVED TO PROGRAM.

01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:10.478
IT HAS REQUIRED A LOT OF

01:24:10.545 --> 01:24:11.946
COORDINATION AN EFFORT LOCALLY

01:24:12.013 --> 01:24:13.114
TO GET ALL PROGRAM COMPONENTS UP

01:24:13.181 --> 01:24:14.582
AND RUNNING BUT WE ARE TRYING TO

01:24:14.649 --> 01:24:15.950
SI SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE

01:24:16.017 --> 01:24:17.185
NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS ENROLLED

01:24:17.252 --> 01:24:18.386
IN THE PROGRAM.

01:24:18.453 --> 01:24:19.487
THE NUMBER OF DISABILITY BENEFIT

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:21.222
APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED AND THE

01:24:21.289 --> 01:24:22.157
RATE AT WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO

01:24:22.223 --> 01:24:23.758
HELP CLIENTS FIND PERMANENT HIGH

01:24:23.825 --> 01:24:25.593
HOUSING ALL OF THOSE NUMBERS ARE

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:26.728
ALSO IN YOUR FACT SHEET.

01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:28.730
AND OUR LAST AND FINAL CDS

01:24:28.797 --> 01:24:29.364
THAT'S HOUSING PROGRAM IS HOME

01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:30.165
SAFE.

01:24:30.231 --> 01:24:32.033
HOME SAFE IS A THREE YEAR PILOT

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:33.334
PROGRAM AS WELL.

01:24:33.401 --> 01:24:34.269
FIND IT AT FIFTEEN MILLION

01:24:34.335 --> 01:24:36.004
DOLLARS ALSO WITH THE COUNTY ONE

01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:37.605
TO ONE MATCH AND IT WAS JUST

01:24:37.672 --> 01:24:39.340
FUNDED THIS PAST FISCAL YEAR SO

01:24:39.407 --> 01:24:40.241
WE ARE JUST THE BEGINNING PHASES

01:24:40.308 --> 01:24:42.944
OF IMPLEMENTATION BUT WE ARE --

01:24:43.011 --> 01:24:44.245
QUITE PLEASE THAT WE WERE ABLE

01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:45.780
TO GET THE R. P. OUT TO COUNTIES

01:24:45.847 --> 01:24:47.515
IN TRIBES APPLICATIONS RETURNED

01:24:47.582 --> 01:24:49.851
AND FUNDING FULLY ALLOCATED TO

01:24:49.918 --> 01:24:50.418
TWENTY FOUR COUNTIES AS OF

01:24:50.485 --> 01:24:51.352
DECEMBER.

01:24:51.419 --> 01:24:52.520
SO WE POSTED INITIAL CONFERENCE

01:24:52.587 --> 01:24:54.923
CALL FOR THE BRING THOSE

01:24:54.989 --> 01:24:56.624
COUNTIES IN FOR THEIR FIRST

01:24:56.691 --> 01:24:58.760
LEARNING FORM IN MARCH.

01:24:58.827 --> 01:25:00.328
THE PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ON ADULT

01:25:00.395 --> 01:25:01.963
PROTECTIVE SERVICES CLIENTS HIS

01:25:02.030 --> 01:25:03.565
WHO ARE EXPERIENCE AND ARE AT

01:25:03.631 --> 01:25:04.699
RISK OF HOMELESSNESS DUE TO

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:06.534
ELDER OR DEPENDENT ADULT ABUSE

01:25:06.601 --> 01:25:07.502
NEGLECT.

01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:08.770
SOUTH NEGLECT OR FINANCIAL

01:25:08.837 --> 01:25:11.005
EXPLOITATION WE EXPECT MANY

01:25:11.072 --> 01:25:11.940
COUNTIES USES FUNDING TO TARGET

01:25:12.006 --> 01:25:13.441
HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION WHICH

01:25:13.508 --> 01:25:15.176
WILL BE A FIRST FOR CSS FUNDING

01:25:15.243 --> 01:25:16.311
IN THIS WAY SAYS SOMETHING WE

01:25:16.377 --> 01:25:18.079
ARE EAGER TO TEST OUT --

01:25:18.146 --> 01:25:19.380
THE STATUTE I WOULD POINT OUT

01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:20.782
DOES REQUIRE US TO EVALUATE THE

01:25:20.849 --> 01:25:21.983
PROGRAMS AND WE ARE IN THE

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:23.051
PROGRESS OF FINALIZING

01:25:23.117 --> 01:25:24.652
EVALUATION DESIGN AND CONTRACT

01:25:24.719 --> 01:25:26.488
HE DETAILS WITH MARGOT WHO SHALL

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:28.857
OUT OF UCSF WHO IS JUST A A

01:25:28.923 --> 01:25:29.958
REMARKABLE EXPERT IN ELDER

01:25:30.024 --> 01:25:31.326
HOMELESSNESS POPULATIONS AND

01:25:31.392 --> 01:25:32.393
RESEARCH.

01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:33.328
SO MORE TO COME ON THIS PROGRAM

01:25:33.394 --> 01:25:34.395
AS WE IMPLEMENT BUT WE ARE

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:36.598
LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING IT UP

01:25:36.664 --> 01:25:39.100
AND RUNNING QUITE QUICKLY.

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:41.102
AND THAT'S ALL.

01:25:41.169 --> 01:25:41.836
FOR VERY MUCH LET'S --

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:44.138
OPEN UP TO QUESTIONS FROM OUR

01:25:44.205 --> 01:25:46.441
COMMITTEE COLLEAGUES I HAVE TWO

01:25:46.508 --> 01:25:47.075
QUESTIONS ONE FOR MISS UP PUT A

01:25:47.141 --> 01:25:47.876
FOOT -- YOU

01:25:47.942 --> 01:25:49.577
MENTIONED THE IMPORTANCE OF DATA.

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:50.144
AND IT LAST YEAR I HAD --

01:25:50.211 --> 01:25:50.678
A BILL MOVING THROUGH THE

01:25:50.745 --> 01:25:52.247
PROCESS --

01:25:52.313 --> 01:25:54.549
THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE STATE --

01:25:54.616 --> 01:25:56.784
TO TO COLLECT DATA FROM LOCAL

01:25:56.851 --> 01:25:57.819
JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE STATE

01:25:57.886 --> 01:25:59.988
AND AND PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION

01:26:00.054 --> 01:26:01.689
TO LOCALITIES --

01:26:01.756 --> 01:26:02.724
IN THE LAST YEAR H. U. D. AS

01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:03.825
MADE A LOT OF STRIVE TO MOVING

01:26:03.892 --> 01:26:06.728
IN THIS DIRECTION SO --

01:26:06.794 --> 01:26:09.531
WE DECIDED THAT.

01:26:09.597 --> 01:26:10.765
YOU MENTIONED --

01:26:10.832 --> 01:26:11.599
THAT THERE STILL IS A NEED FOR

01:26:11.666 --> 01:26:13.234
ADDITIONAL COORDINATION BETWEEN

01:26:13.301 --> 01:26:15.370
LOCALS AND THE STATE IS SECOND

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:16.704
REQUIRE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES I

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:18.506
JUST WONDERED --

01:26:18.573 --> 01:26:20.041
WHETHER THAT CAN HAPPEN IN THE

01:26:20.108 --> 01:26:21.609
CURRENT BUDGET.

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:23.111
IT ABSOLUTELY WILL REQUIRE

01:26:23.177 --> 01:26:25.079
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES --

01:26:25.146 --> 01:26:26.915
WHAT WE WERE TASKED WITH WAS

01:26:26.981 --> 01:26:28.917
DOING ALL OF THE?

01:26:28.983 --> 01:26:30.752
DEVELOPMENT WORK --

01:26:30.818 --> 01:26:33.054
INCLUDING ISSUING A REQUEST FOR

01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:35.390
INFORMATION TO VENDORS.

01:26:35.456 --> 01:26:37.592
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO GATHER

01:26:37.659 --> 01:26:39.694
THE INFORMATION ON WHAT IT WOULD

01:26:39.761 --> 01:26:41.162
TAKE -- BOTH

01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:44.899
PROGRAMMATIC LEE AND FISCALLY TO

01:26:44.966 --> 01:26:47.335
FIRST GET ACCESS AT THE STATE

01:26:47.402 --> 01:26:49.437
LEVEL TO THE LOCAL DATA THAT IS

01:26:49.504 --> 01:26:50.738
BEING COLLECTED SO MUCH ALONG

01:26:50.805 --> 01:26:53.875
THE LINES OF YOUR BILL LAST YEAR --

01:26:53.942 --> 01:26:55.343
AS ALLEY MENTIONED SOME OF THAT

01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:57.478
WORK IS BEING DONE ON A PILOT

01:26:57.545 --> 01:26:59.047
BASIS -- OUR

01:26:59.113 --> 01:27:01.816
GOAL IN PHASE ONE WOULD BE TO

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:03.918
EXPAND THAT SO THAT THAT ALL OF

01:27:03.985 --> 01:27:06.354
THE LOCAL CO SEES CONTINUES OF

01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:07.755
CARE WHO ARE GATHERING THAT.

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:09.924
DATA -- THAT

01:27:09.991 --> 01:27:12.527
IS THAT'S THE DATA WOULD BE WERE

01:27:12.594 --> 01:27:14.696
CURRENTLY IT BYPASSES THE STATE

01:27:14.762 --> 01:27:16.497
AND GOES STRAIGHT TO THE FEDERAL

01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:18.433
GOVERNMENT FOR THEIR PROGRAMS.

01:27:18.499 --> 01:27:20.001
ONE OF THE COMPONENTS THAT WE

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:22.470
ARE EXCITED ABOUT WOULD BE THE

01:27:22.537 --> 01:27:24.606
OPTION THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS

01:27:24.672 --> 01:27:25.573
COULD.

01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:28.443
PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE LEVEL

01:27:28.509 --> 01:27:29.711
HMIS ARE HOMELESS MANAGEMENT

01:27:29.777 --> 01:27:31.512
INFORMATION SYSTEMS SO THAT

01:27:31.579 --> 01:27:33.381
THOSE JURISDICTIONS THAT FIND IT

01:27:33.448 --> 01:27:35.683
CHALLENGING TO ADMINISTER THEIR

01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:37.385
OWN AGE MY US COULD INSTEAD

01:27:37.452 --> 01:27:38.886
PARTICIPATE.

01:27:38.953 --> 01:27:40.688
IN THE STATE LEVEL --

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:42.624
APPROACH HOWEVER WE WOULD NOT

01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:44.659
REQUIRE THAT MANY JURISDICTIONS

01:27:44.726 --> 01:27:46.861
HAVE THEIR OWN DATA MANAGEMENT

01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:48.763
SYSTEMS THAT ARE DOING X.

01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:51.165
EXCELLENT ANALYSIS ALREADY.

01:27:51.232 --> 01:27:53.234
THE GOAL REALLY IS TO DEVELOP

01:27:53.301 --> 01:27:55.003
THE ANALYTIC CAPACITY AT THE

01:27:55.069 --> 01:27:56.371
STATE LEVEL.

01:27:56.437 --> 01:27:58.740
AND BUT IT IS DEFINITELY FUNDING

01:27:58.806 --> 01:28:00.775
RIP BUDGET RELATED FUNDING

01:28:00.842 --> 01:28:02.510
RELATED AND I'D LIKE TO JUST NOT

01:28:02.577 --> 01:28:03.811
A CONVERSATION WE NEED TO HAVE

01:28:03.878 --> 01:28:05.346
TODAY BUT LOVE TO HEAR MORE ON

01:28:05.413 --> 01:28:06.481
WHAT THAT FUNNY NEED IS AND

01:28:06.547 --> 01:28:08.383
ENGAGE WITH A C. D. ABOUT THE

01:28:08.449 --> 01:28:09.984
WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING --

01:28:10.051 --> 01:28:11.419
WITH THEM I ASKED TO SEE IF

01:28:11.486 --> 01:28:13.287
THERE'S A WAY FOR US TO TO

01:28:13.354 --> 01:28:13.655
RESOLVE THIS --

01:28:13.721 --> 01:28:15.390
IN THE COMING MONTHS ONE FINAL

01:28:15.456 --> 01:28:18.393
QUESTION --

01:28:18.459 --> 01:28:20.595
TO MS -- NOT.

01:28:20.662 --> 01:28:21.062
THE GENDER.

01:28:21.129 --> 01:28:21.663
OF YOUR THE ONE PERSON HERE

01:28:21.729 --> 01:28:22.196
REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL

01:28:22.263 --> 01:28:23.798
PERSPECTIVE AND IF I HAD TO ASK

01:28:23.865 --> 01:28:25.299
YOU IF THERE IS ONE MAJOR THING

01:28:25.366 --> 01:28:26.668
CALIFORNIA.

01:28:26.734 --> 01:28:28.636
COULD FOCUS ON TO ADDRESS ARE

01:28:28.703 --> 01:28:29.871
HOMELESS CRISIS OF ALL THE

01:28:29.937 --> 01:28:31.339
THINGS THAT YOU MENTIONED WHAT

01:28:31.406 --> 01:28:32.206
WOULD BE THAT THING.

01:28:32.273 --> 01:28:33.374
SORT OF PUT YOU ON THE SPOT BUT

01:28:33.441 --> 01:28:35.009
YOU HAVE A PERSPECTIVE THAT'S A

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:35.576
LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM ALL OF

01:28:35.643 --> 01:28:37.011
OURS.

01:28:37.078 --> 01:28:41.716
I THINK THE I'M PROBABLY GONNA.

01:28:41.783 --> 01:28:43.384
COMBINE A LOT OF THINGS I SIDE

01:28:43.451 --> 01:28:45.420
INTO THE IDEA THAT A LOT OF

01:28:45.486 --> 01:28:47.288
COMMUNITIES HAVE A LOT OF THE

01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:49.023
RIGHT PIECES IN PLACE.

01:28:49.090 --> 01:28:50.491
BUT DON'T KIND OF HAVE THE RIGHT

01:28:50.558 --> 01:28:52.560
FLOW THROUGH THE SYSTEM IN OTHER

01:28:52.627 --> 01:28:54.462
WORDS YOU HAVE A LOT OF SEPARATE

01:28:54.529 --> 01:28:56.397
PROGRAMS THAT SOME OPERATING

01:28:56.464 --> 01:28:57.598
VERY WELL --

01:28:57.665 --> 01:29:00.768
AND SOME NOT PERFORMING AS WELL

01:29:00.835 --> 01:29:02.970
BUT THERE ISN'T AS AS ENOUGH

01:29:03.037 --> 01:29:05.573
ALIGNMENT IN EACH COMMUNITY --

01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:07.675
IN TERMS OF GETTING PEOPLE

01:29:07.742 --> 01:29:09.377
IDENTIFIED QUICKLY INTO SHELTER

01:29:09.444 --> 01:29:10.678
OR QUICKLY IN TO HOUSING AND

01:29:10.745 --> 01:29:12.447
THEN QUICKLY OUT OF SHELTER AND

01:29:12.513 --> 01:29:13.948
TO HOUSING SO IT'S THERE'S AN

01:29:14.015 --> 01:29:15.416
ALIGNMENT THAT'S MISSING IN A

01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:16.884
LOT OF COMMUNITIES --

01:29:16.951 --> 01:29:17.919
EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVE SEPARATE

01:29:17.985 --> 01:29:19.487
PROGRAMS IT'S SOMETIMES HAVE ALL

01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:22.523
OF THOSE PROGRAMS IN ONE AGENCY --

01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:24.992
THE THE PIECES THAT I THINK ARE --

01:29:25.059 --> 01:29:26.594
MISSING ARE THAT SORT OF

01:29:26.661 --> 01:29:29.597
COORDINATION ALL PROGRAMS KIND

01:29:29.664 --> 01:29:31.632
OF A LINE WITH THE SINGLE MINDED

01:29:31.699 --> 01:29:33.468
FOCUS A LASER FOCUS ON GETTING

01:29:33.534 --> 01:29:35.269
PEOPLE OUT OF THE SYSTEM INTO

01:29:35.336 --> 01:29:36.938
HOUSING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

01:29:37.004 --> 01:29:37.805
AND SO THERE'S A PROGRAMS

01:29:37.872 --> 01:29:39.874
RUNNING IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS --

01:29:39.941 --> 01:29:41.175
A LOT OF PROGRAM TO SAY THERE

01:29:41.242 --> 01:29:42.210
HOUSING FIRST BUT ACTUALLY HAVE

01:29:42.276 --> 01:29:43.578
A LOT OF BARRIERS OR HAVE

01:29:43.644 --> 01:29:45.913
DIFFICULTY AND A LOT OF SHELTERS

01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:48.082
THAT ARE UNDERFUNDED AND AND

01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:49.550

01:36:31.719 --> 01:36:32.553
LET ME BRING IT BACK TO THE

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:35.156
COMMITTEE QUESTIONS YES SOME

01:36:35.222 --> 01:36:36.423
REMEMBER QUIRK SILVA.

01:36:36.490 --> 01:36:40.361
THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING TO

01:36:40.427 --> 01:36:43.264
ALL THE PANELISTS OF THREE

01:36:43.330 --> 01:36:44.899
QUESTIONS THAT ARE INTERRELATED

01:36:44.965 --> 01:36:47.468
SO I WILL GO AHEAD AND I THINK

01:36:47.535 --> 01:36:49.570
I'M GONNA BE ASKING --

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:51.238
I THINK --

01:36:51.305 --> 01:36:55.876
MRS POWELL HOW THE FACT THAT --

01:36:55.943 --> 01:36:57.411
IS THEIR DATA THAT SHOWS WHAT

01:36:57.478 --> 01:36:58.345
TOTAL AMOUNT OF HOUSING DOLLARS

01:36:58.412 --> 01:37:01.749
EACH COUNTY HAS RECIEVED --

01:37:01.815 --> 01:37:03.551
JUST ON ALL.

01:37:03.617 --> 01:37:05.953
TYPES OF FUNDING SO NOT BECAUSE

01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:07.254
I SEE A LOT OF CHARTS THAT SAY.

01:37:07.321 --> 01:37:08.589
HOW MANY COUNTIES HAVE RECEIVED

01:37:08.656 --> 01:37:10.424
FUNDING BUT A TOTAL AMOUNT OF

01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:11.825
DOLLARS?

01:37:11.892 --> 01:37:13.360
SO THAT'S ONE QUESTION.

01:37:13.427 --> 01:37:15.262
AND THEN SECONDLY --

01:37:15.329 --> 01:37:19.200
IS THERE A COMPARISON OF NOT

01:37:19.266 --> 01:37:22.436
ONLY WHAT MONEY IS AVAILABLE BUT

01:37:22.503 --> 01:37:23.938
WHAT AT THE COUNTIES HAVE

01:37:24.004 --> 01:37:26.440
APPLIED FOR SO FOR EXAMPLE.

01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:29.310
IF WE ONLY SEE ON NINE COUNTIES

01:37:29.376 --> 01:37:31.612
RECEIVING FUNDS DOES THAT MEAN A

01:37:31.679 --> 01:37:34.081
COUNTY JUST DIDN'T PARTICIPATE.

01:37:34.148 --> 01:37:37.484
OR THEY WERE NOT CHOSEN --

01:37:37.551 --> 01:37:40.521
SO HOW DO WE KNOW IF THEY JUST

01:37:40.588 --> 01:37:41.956
HAVE AN IMPLIED.

01:37:42.022 --> 01:37:42.856
BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE HEAR

01:37:42.923 --> 01:37:44.225
THERE'S NO MONEY OR WE'RE NOT

01:37:44.291 --> 01:37:45.759
GETTING AT AND MAYBE THEY

01:37:45.826 --> 01:37:48.062
HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN APPLIED --

01:37:48.128 --> 01:37:49.196
AND THEN.

01:37:49.263 --> 01:37:54.034
ALSO THERE WAS OF OF OF

01:37:54.101 --> 01:37:57.538
LEGISLATION LAST YEAR TO LOOK AT

01:37:57.605 --> 01:37:59.073
COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN

01:37:59.139 --> 01:38:00.841
USING SOME OF THEIR HOUSING

01:38:00.908 --> 01:38:02.409
FUNDS THAT COME TO THE STATE TO

01:38:02.476 --> 01:38:03.711
THE COUNTY --

01:38:03.777 --> 01:38:06.880
AND I KNOW IT THE SAN DIEGO AND

01:38:06.947 --> 01:38:09.216
ORANGE COUNTY AND AN LOS ANGELES

01:38:09.283 --> 01:38:11.151
WERE PART OF THAT LIST THAT HAD

01:38:11.218 --> 01:38:13.854
ACCUMULATED QUITE A LOT OF FUNDS.

01:38:13.921 --> 01:38:15.356
AND MAYBE THEY HAVE PLANS FROM

01:38:15.422 --> 01:38:16.957
BUT THEY HAD IT BEEN USED SO

01:38:17.024 --> 01:38:18.192
THERE WAS --

01:38:18.259 --> 01:38:20.694
LEGISLATION TO TRY TO MOVE THAT

01:38:20.761 --> 01:38:22.663
BACK INTO --

01:38:22.730 --> 01:38:24.531
KIND OF A CENTRAL DOLLARS AND

01:38:24.598 --> 01:38:26.533
HAVE A MARIE APPLY --

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:28.369
KIND OF THE USE IT OR LOSE IT

01:38:28.435 --> 01:38:29.903
MODEL -- DO

01:38:29.970 --> 01:38:31.672
WE HAVE RECORD OF HOW THAT'S

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:33.374
BEING HANDLED SO THAT'S A LOT OF

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:34.508
QUESTIONS SOMEONE SAW JUST THROW

01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:36.944
THOSE ALL OUT. TO WHOEVER FILLED

01:38:37.011 --> 01:38:39.013
I'LL START AND THEN HANDED OVER

01:38:39.079 --> 01:38:41.148
TO MY COLLEAGUES IF I MAY UM.

01:38:41.215 --> 01:38:43.250
THE SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR FIRST

01:38:43.317 --> 01:38:44.318
QUESTION ABOUT THE TOTAL AMOUNT

01:38:44.385 --> 01:38:46.220
OF FUNDING THAT IS CURRENTLY

01:38:46.287 --> 01:38:47.955
GOING OUT TO OR THE COUNTIES

01:38:48.022 --> 01:38:49.256
HAVE ACCESS.

01:38:49.323 --> 01:38:51.258
TO WE DON'T HAVE THAT DATA

01:38:51.325 --> 01:38:53.894
COLLECTED.

01:38:53.961 --> 01:38:55.496
ACTIVELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:38:55.562 --> 01:38:57.865
FINANCE. TO IDENTIFY TO GET A

01:38:57.931 --> 01:39:00.267
REALLY CLEAR PICTURE OF OF THE

01:39:00.334 --> 01:39:01.568
AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT'S GOING

01:39:01.635 --> 01:39:03.570
TO THE VARIOUS STATE DEPARTMENTS

01:39:03.637 --> 01:39:06.373
THAT ARE FOCUSED ON HOMELESSNESS.

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:07.841
AND THEN THOSE THE WHAT'S WHAT

01:39:07.908 --> 01:39:09.910
WHAT'S FOCUSED ON HOUSING OR

01:39:09.977 --> 01:39:11.145
HOUSING RELATED SERVICES.

01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:12.946
IT CAN BE MORE CHALLENGING THAN

01:39:13.013 --> 01:39:14.782
IT MIGHT APPEAR TO DEVELOP THAT

01:39:14.848 --> 01:39:16.350
INFORMATION BECAUSE A LOT OF

01:39:16.417 --> 01:39:17.851
PROGRAMS.

01:39:17.918 --> 01:39:19.386
ARE NOT.

01:39:19.453 --> 01:39:20.988
REALLY BLACK AND WHITE EITHER

01:39:21.055 --> 01:39:22.256
THEY'RE IN ARE THERE OUT THERE

01:39:22.323 --> 01:39:24.291
PERHAPS IT'S AN OPTION TO

01:39:24.358 --> 01:39:25.959
PROVIDE HOUSING AND HOUSING

01:39:26.026 --> 01:39:27.961
SUPPORTS OR PART OF THE

01:39:28.028 --> 01:39:30.397
POPULATION THAT THE SERVICE IS

01:39:30.464 --> 01:39:31.765
HOMELESS OR AT RISK.

01:39:31.832 --> 01:39:33.167
SO WE'RE REALLY WANTING TO BE

01:39:33.233 --> 01:39:35.703
SURE THAT WE CAN BE ACCURATE IN

01:39:35.769 --> 01:39:37.504
WHATEVER INFORMATION WE GATHER

01:39:37.571 --> 01:39:39.373
AND AND THEN PUBLICIZE.

01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:41.342
THE FIRST STEP WAS IN IN DOING

01:39:41.408 --> 01:39:43.510
THE TWO BROCHURES WHICH ACTUALLY --

01:39:43.577 --> 01:39:46.013
H. C. D. INITIATED TO IDENTIFY

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.548
WHAT THE PROGRAMS ARE AT THE

01:39:47.614 --> 01:39:49.950
STATE LEVEL AND WHAT KINDS OF

01:39:50.017 --> 01:39:51.251
SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THE FROM

01:39:51.318 --> 01:39:53.554
THE FUND --

01:39:53.620 --> 01:39:54.488
LET ME TURN IT OVER TO MY

01:39:54.555 --> 01:39:56.590
COLLEAGUES FOR MORE ON I MEAN

01:39:56.657 --> 01:39:57.658
NOBODY ELSE HE WAS --

01:39:57.725 --> 01:40:00.627
FOR OUR PATH BOND PROGRAMS WE DO

01:40:00.694 --> 01:40:02.496
HAVE THE PROPER SIX PROP ONE SEE

01:40:02.563 --> 01:40:03.897
WE HAVE EXPENDED ANYTHING FROM

01:40:03.964 --> 01:40:05.666
PROP ONE OF COURSE YET WE DO

01:40:05.733 --> 01:40:06.734
HAVE A BREAKDOWN OF WHAT HAS

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:08.302
GONE TEACH COUNTY FROM THIS

01:40:08.369 --> 01:40:08.902
PROGRAMS.

01:40:08.969 --> 01:40:10.671
NOW THAT CAPITAL SAY IS MOST OF

01:40:10.738 --> 01:40:11.538
OUR PROGRAMS GO DIRECTLY TO

01:40:11.605 --> 01:40:13.707
DEVELOPERS TO BUILD HOUSING

01:40:13.774 --> 01:40:14.475
WITHINTHOSE KINDS OF DON'T.

01:40:14.541 --> 01:40:16.343
FUNDS GOING TO COUNTIES --

01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:20.748
IT'S IT'S SO IT'S DEVELOPMENT OR

01:40:20.814 --> 01:40:22.850
RESOURCES THAT HAVE OCCURRED AND

01:40:22.916 --> 01:40:24.418
SO WE DO HAVE SOME PROGRAMS THAT

01:40:24.485 --> 01:40:26.120
DO FLOATED CONTINUES OF CARING

01:40:26.186 --> 01:40:29.556
COUNTIES THAT I MENTIONED --

01:40:29.623 --> 01:40:32.192
AND I THINK YOU KNOW IF YOU TO

01:40:32.259 --> 01:40:33.160
WE SEE EVERY.

01:40:33.227 --> 01:40:34.495
TEAM OF CARE OR COUNTY ACCESS

01:40:34.561 --> 01:40:35.729
THOSE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE HAD

01:40:35.796 --> 01:40:36.663
THAT PROBLEM WITH THE LEAST THE

01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:38.098
PROGRAMS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT HERE

01:40:38.165 --> 01:40:39.400
TODAY -- AND

01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:40.801
LACK OF ACCESS --

01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:41.902
I THINK IT'S THE PROGRAMS THAT

01:40:41.969 --> 01:40:43.570
ARE MAYBE MORE LIMITED IN FUNDS

01:40:43.637 --> 01:40:45.572
THAT ARE COMPETITIVE THAT --

01:40:45.639 --> 01:40:46.473
THAT HAVE THAT HAVE SOME OF

01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:47.641
THOSE CHALLENGES RIGHT BECAUSE

01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:49.009
THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE BASING POLICY

01:40:49.076 --> 01:40:50.511
PRIORITIES AND WHATEVER

01:40:50.577 --> 01:40:51.512
WHICHEVER APPLICATIONS YOUR BEST

01:40:51.578 --> 01:40:52.713
SUITED FOR ME HAVE THE MOST

01:40:52.780 --> 01:40:54.782
LEVERAGE FROM LOCAL RESOURCE

01:40:54.848 --> 01:40:55.649
STANDPOINT OF SORTS OF THINGS.

01:40:55.716 --> 01:40:56.950
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE

01:40:57.017 --> 01:40:59.953
LEGISLATION YOU TALKED ABOUT SO --

01:41:00.020 --> 01:41:01.422
I'D LOVE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT WAS --

01:41:01.488 --> 01:41:03.557
BILL THAT WAS ACTUALLY HE

01:41:03.624 --> 01:41:04.491
STEPPED OUT OF THE ROOM ON

01:41:04.558 --> 01:41:06.860
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GLORIA BROUGHT

01:41:06.927 --> 01:41:08.429
LAST JUNE.

01:41:08.495 --> 01:41:13.834
AND IT WAS --

01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:15.335
THE LAST DAY OF SESSION IN JUNE

01:41:15.402 --> 01:41:16.336
AND IT WAS.

01:41:16.403 --> 01:41:17.037
TO TAKE.

01:41:17.104 --> 01:41:17.738
A LOOK AT THE COUNTIES THAT WERE

01:41:17.805 --> 01:41:21.108
NOT USING THEIR HOUSING DOLLARS

01:41:21.175 --> 01:41:22.843
THAT THEY'VE HAD FOR THREE OH AT

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:24.445
LEAST THREE YEARS AND MARK BEING

01:41:24.511 --> 01:41:26.613
USED AND TO PUT THEM --

01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:28.882
IN ESSENCE INTO ONE TYPE OF

01:41:28.949 --> 01:41:30.484
MAYBE THE MIDDLE SERVICES ACT

01:41:30.551 --> 01:41:31.685
DOLLARS YES OF THE HOUSING

01:41:31.752 --> 01:41:33.053
DOLLARS OKAY SO MAYBE MAYBE THIS

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:34.488
FUNDS YES SO WE ARE HEALTHCARE

01:41:34.555 --> 01:41:37.891
SERVICES WERE PROBABLY THE BEST

01:41:37.958 --> 01:41:39.326
SUITED ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

01:41:39.393 --> 01:41:41.261
YEAH AND JUST ON ON ARE PROGRAMS

01:41:41.328 --> 01:41:41.895
AROUND THAT --

01:41:41.962 --> 01:41:43.464
IMPLYING AND AND THOSE PIECES SO --

01:41:43.530 --> 01:41:43.964
MOST OF OUR PROGRAMS ARE

01:41:44.031 --> 01:41:48.635
COMPETITIVE THEY ARE NOT --

01:41:48.702 --> 01:41:50.737
SORT OF IS THAT THE FUNDING

01:41:50.804 --> 01:41:52.272
CANNOT BE SPREAD ACROSS THE

01:41:52.339 --> 01:41:53.307
STATE FOR THE MOST PART THEY'RE

01:41:53.373 --> 01:41:54.775
THEY'RE YOU KNOW I AGES P. AS

01:41:54.842 --> 01:41:56.009
ARE ONLY PROGRAM THAT I THINK IN

01:41:56.076 --> 01:41:57.177
THEORY IS IS PRETTY MUCH

01:41:57.244 --> 01:41:58.712
STATEWIDE AT THIS POINT --

01:41:58.779 --> 01:42:00.147
I WOULD MENTION I MEAN WE DO

01:42:00.214 --> 01:42:01.882
HAVE MANY MORE APPLICANTS THAN I

01:42:01.949 --> 01:42:05.152
MEAN AT FOR FOR H. STAFF --

01:42:05.219 --> 01:42:06.820
WE'D WE HAD THE THIRTY NINE

01:42:06.887 --> 01:42:07.888
COUNTIES FOR FOR ARE BRINGING

01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:09.056
FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM WE HAD

01:42:09.122 --> 01:42:10.157
ALMOST DOUBLE THE TWELVE THAT

01:42:10.224 --> 01:42:11.558
GOT FUNDED BUT WITH TEN MILLION

01:42:11.625 --> 01:42:12.860
DOLLARS OVER THREE YEARS.

01:42:12.926 --> 01:42:14.628
THAT CAN ONLY GO SO FAR --

01:42:14.695 --> 01:42:16.997
I ALSO WOULD MENTION I THINK

01:42:17.064 --> 01:42:18.599
JUST [inaudible]

01:42:18.665 --> 01:42:20.033
FOR YOU KNOW. TO ADD TO THE

01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:21.368
CONVERSATION THAT THE COUNTY ONE

01:42:21.435 --> 01:42:22.503
TO ONE MATCH --

01:42:22.569 --> 01:42:24.438
IT CAN BE A BARRIER FOR UNDER

01:42:24.505 --> 01:42:25.672
RESOURCE COMMUNITIES AS WELL AND

01:42:25.739 --> 01:42:26.907
SO WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME I

01:42:26.974 --> 01:42:28.342
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TRYING TO

01:42:28.408 --> 01:42:29.543
HELP COUNTIES THINK THROUGH

01:42:29.610 --> 01:42:31.111
WHERE THEY COULD GET THOSE MATCH

01:42:31.178 --> 01:42:33.547
DOLLARS FROM.

01:42:33.614 --> 01:42:35.916

WE INCREASED HOMELESS ASSISTANCE

01:43:50.123 --> 01:43:51.992
WE WERE ABLE TO FINALLY INCREASE

01:43:52.059 --> 01:43:53.327
THE RATES TO MEET THE CURRENT

01:43:53.393 --> 01:43:54.595
DEMANDS.

AND THAT WE ARE WORKING ON THE

01:43:56.063 --> 01:43:58.899
H. TAPPED TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE

01:43:58.966 --> 01:43:59.066
CAN.

01:43:59.132 --> 01:44:00.634
BETTER.

01:44:00.701 --> 01:44:02.569
WORK WITH A PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN

01:44:02.636 --> 01:44:04.371
SHOWN TO BE SO SUCCESSFUL.

01:44:04.438 --> 01:44:06.173
I WANTED TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT

01:44:06.239 --> 01:44:07.441

PROGRAM.

01:44:10.177 --> 01:44:12.079
AS FRESNO COUNTY WAS NOT ONE OF

01:44:12.145 --> 01:44:13.547
THE TWELVE COUNTIES WHICH WAS

01:44:13.614 --> 01:44:16.183

01:44:16.249 --> 01:44:17.584
RURAL COUNTIES TO STRUGGLE.

01:44:17.651 --> 01:44:19.553
WHEN IT SEEMS THAT THE PROGRAMS

01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:21.788
ARE MORE DESIGNED --

01:44:21.855 --> 01:44:23.924
FOR OUR URBAN AREAS --

01:44:23.991 --> 01:44:26.293

TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

01:44:33.634 --> 01:44:35.168
BUT IT IS THE SILO BRING UP

01:44:35.235 --> 01:44:36.103
INFORMATION.

01:44:36.169 --> 01:44:37.704
THERE'S A RAND REPORT THAT COMES

01:44:37.771 --> 01:44:39.573
IN THIS STUDY THAT AT SOME POINT

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:41.775
I WISH WE WOULD LOOK AT A LARGER

01:44:41.842 --> 01:44:43.276
FISCAL ANALYSIS.

01:44:43.343 --> 01:44:44.444
WHICH SAID THAT THE RETURN ON

01:44:44.511 --> 01:44:46.113

THAT FOR EVERY DOLLAR YOU SPEND

01:44:50.784 --> 01:44:54.287
IT'S A DOLLAR AND TOTAL SPENDING

01:44:54.354 --> 01:44:55.722
THAT THEY COULD FOLLOW.

01:44:55.789 --> 01:44:57.924

I DON'T THINK THAT THAT IS THE

01:50:13.873 --> 01:50:14.774
APPROACH WE SHOULD TAKE.

01:50:14.841 --> 01:50:16.443

WORKER AND THEN CREATE THE THE

01:51:08.561 --> 01:51:10.330
SYSTEM THAT WOULD WORK FROM OUR

01:51:10.397 --> 01:51:12.465
VERY CITY HERE IN THE CAPITAL

01:51:12.532 --> 01:51:12.665

01:51:16.503 --> 01:51:17.337
WHY WE'RE HERE YEAH THE AND

01:51:17.404 --> 01:51:19.539

HAS AFFECTED ALL OF US.

01:51:28.615 --> 01:51:32.318
AND I THINK THAT HAVING TASK

01:51:32.385 --> 01:51:34.354
HAVING SO MANY ORGANIZATIONS

01:51:34.421 --> 01:51:36.189
THAT ARE TRYING TO COME UP WITH

01:51:36.256 --> 01:51:37.957
A SOLUTION THE FACT THAT THE

01:51:38.024 --> 01:51:39.192
HOUSING.

01:51:39.259 --> 01:51:41.161
COMMITTEE AND THE HUMAN SERVICES

01:51:41.227 --> 01:51:43.229
COMMITTEE HAS SAID THIS IS

01:51:43.296 --> 01:51:45.031
BIGGER THAN JUST HOUSING WE HAVE

01:51:45.098 --> 01:51:47.067
TO FIND OTHER WAYS TO HELP SOLVE

01:51:47.133 --> 01:51:47.834
THIS.

01:51:47.901 --> 01:51:49.602
WE WANT TO BRING IN THE EXPERTS

01:51:49.669 --> 01:51:52.205
BECAUSE WE HAVE EXPERT TO HAVE

01:51:52.272 --> 01:51:54.307
BEEN ON THE GROUND THE OF THE DO

01:51:54.374 --> 01:51:56.342
WORKING ON THIS AND HAVE HAD

01:51:56.409 --> 01:51:58.178
GREAT SUCCESSES.

01:51:58.244 --> 01:51:59.846
WE HAVE MUCH WORK TO BE DONE AND

01:51:59.913 --> 01:52:01.147
I THINK YOUR POINT IS VERY WELL

01:52:01.214 --> 01:52:02.782
TAKEN THAT WE STILL HAVE SO MUCH

01:52:02.849 --> 01:52:04.684
MORE WORK I THINK AS ASSEMBLY

01:52:04.751 --> 01:52:05.819
MEMBER QUIRK SILVA HAS.

01:52:05.885 --> 01:52:07.554
INDICATED THAT WE NEED TO KNOW

01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:09.189
HOW THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT

01:52:09.255 --> 01:52:10.723
GOES TO YOUR POINT AS WELL.

01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:13.493

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.495
WHAT OUR EXPERTS ARE SHARING

01:52:15.562 --> 01:52:18.431
WITH US SO THAT WE CAN THEN?

01:52:18.498 --> 01:52:20.500
DETERMINE WHAT LEGISLATION NEEDS

01:52:20.567 --> 01:52:22.368
TO BE INTRODUCED OR WHAT MORE

01:52:22.435 --> 01:52:24.737
NEEDS TO BE DONE BECAUSE IT IS

01:52:24.804 --> 01:52:28.174
SUCH A SERIOUS ISSUE I JUST.

01:52:28.241 --> 01:52:30.910
JUST AS CHAIRMAN --

01:52:30.977 --> 01:52:32.812
AND DAVID CHIU SAID IT'S A MORAL

01:52:32.879 --> 01:52:34.447
CRISIS THE MORE KIND OF CRISIS

01:52:34.514 --> 01:52:35.782
OF THE DAY.

01:52:35.849 --> 01:52:38.451
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE TO

01:52:38.518 --> 01:52:39.519
TAKE THE WE ARE NOT TAKING IT AS

01:52:39.586 --> 01:52:41.855
A CRISIS WE NORTH OF FACTORS SO

01:52:41.921 --> 01:52:44.991
IT IS SO SITUATION WE CAN CALL

01:52:45.058 --> 01:52:46.626
IT THAT SO CRISIS ABOUT THE LACK

01:52:46.693 --> 01:52:48.695
OF A BUDGET REFLECTION IN THE

01:52:48.761 --> 01:52:51.131
POLICY AND ON ACTIONS ARE WE

01:52:51.197 --> 01:52:52.132
TAKING YOU TACKLE IT.

01:52:52.198 --> 01:52:53.199
THAT'S A CRISIS I THINK THAT'S A

01:52:53.266 --> 01:52:54.434
FAIR COMMENT AND I THINK THAT

01:52:54.501 --> 01:52:55.568
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HEAR

01:52:55.635 --> 01:52:57.804
FROM OUR FROM OUR EXPERTS BUT I

01:52:57.871 --> 01:52:59.706
THINK THAT THE LEGISLATION THAT

01:52:59.772 --> 01:53:00.673
IS INTRODUCED.

01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:02.408
YOU KNOW FROM OUR VARIOUS EVEN

01:53:02.475 --> 01:53:06.379
AT THE COUNTY LEVEL --

AT THE CITY LEVEL --

01:53:08.982 --> 01:53:11.451
SO IMPORTANT SO IMPORTANT AND IT

01:53:11.518 --> 01:53:12.652
CAN'T BE SOMETHING THAT WE

01:53:12.719 --> 01:53:15.555
SIMPLY THROW MONEY AT IT'S GOT

01:53:15.622 --> 01:53:17.056
TO BE SOMETHING THAT HAS RESULTS.

01:53:17.123 --> 01:53:18.625
AND MANY OF YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT

01:53:18.691 --> 01:53:20.093
SOME OF THOSE RESULTS BUT WHAT'S

01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:21.628
MOST IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO

01:53:21.694 --> 01:53:22.729
WORK TOGETHER BECAUSE WE DON'T

01:53:22.795 --> 01:53:24.130
WANT THE MONEY JUST FLOWING AND

01:53:24.197 --> 01:53:25.665
WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT.

01:53:25.732 --> 01:53:27.834
IT THAT WE COORDINATE SO THAT

01:53:27.901 --> 01:53:29.435
WE'RE NOT ALL.

01:53:29.502 --> 01:53:30.970
EVERYBODY RECEIVES MONEY GOES TO

01:53:31.037 --> 01:53:33.339
THE SAME GROUP IT HAS TO BE

01:53:33.406 --> 01:53:34.874
TAKEN IF WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

01:53:34.941 --> 01:53:35.742
TAKE CARE OF THE ENTIRE

01:53:35.808 --> 01:53:36.743
SITUATION --

01:53:36.809 --> 01:53:39.879

01:53:41.447 --> 01:53:42.682

HIGHEST NEED HOUSEHOLDS IN OUR

SUPPORTS WITH SOME TOO SICK FOR

01:58:37.443 --> 01:58:38.511
MANY.

01:58:38.578 --> 01:58:40.046
OF OUR HOUSING PROJECTS.

01:58:40.112 --> 01:58:42.081

STE.

01:59:09.442 --> 01:59:10.943
THIS SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT IS DUE

01:59:11.010 --> 01:59:12.745
TO THE LACK OF HOMELESS HOUSING

01:59:12.812 --> 01:59:14.347

PROJECTS WORK WHICH FORCES THEM

INTO THE 9% PROGRAM AND MAKES

02:01:05.658 --> 02:01:08.094
THEM INHERENTLY LESS COMPETITIVE

02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:09.595

CD FUNDS ON THE SAME UNIT WOULD

02:01:14.934 --> 02:01:16.135
IMPROVE THE LIKELIHOOD OF

ADDITIONAL 4% TAX CREDITS IN THE

02:01:20.172 --> 02:01:21.407
KINGS UNTIL LARRY COUNTIES ARE

FROM THE FROM HYDE TO THE STATE

02:01:32.518 --> 02:01:34.387
WHERE A LOCAL NO FOR COMPETITION

02:01:34.453 --> 02:01:35.488
TAKES PLACE.

02:01:35.554 --> 02:01:37.523
CEO SEES HAVE TO COMPETE FOR THE

02:01:37.590 --> 02:01:39.925
MONEY ALLOCATED TO THEIR REGION

02:01:39.992 --> 02:01:41.827
AND THE STATE PUTS A LIMIT OF

02:01:41.894 --> 02:01:43.963
TWO PROJECTS PER CO SEE THAT CAN

02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:45.297
BE SUBMITTED.

02:01:45.364 --> 02:01:46.799
THE LACK OF LOCAL CONTROL OF

02:01:46.866 --> 02:01:48.501
THESE FUNDS CREATE UNSTABLE

02:01:48.567 --> 02:01:51.937
PROJECTS THAT OFTEN CLOSE WITHIN

02:01:52.004 --> 02:01:52.571
TWELVE TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS HAVE

02:01:52.638 --> 02:01:53.572
BEEN OPENED.

02:01:53.639 --> 02:01:55.541
OUR REGION IS GREATLY IMPACTED

02:01:55.608 --> 02:01:57.376
BY THIS PROCESS WHICH CAN BE

02:01:57.443 --> 02:01:59.578
CORRECTED BY A SIMPLE REDESIGN

02:01:59.645 --> 02:02:01.447
OF THE PROCESS AND MIGHT I ADD

02:02:01.514 --> 02:02:04.150
NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO THE

02:02:04.216 --> 02:02:04.917
STATE.

02:02:04.984 --> 02:02:06.152
ANOTHER CHALLENGE WE EXPERIENCE

02:02:06.218 --> 02:02:07.820
IS THE COST IN EXCESS ABILITY OF

02:02:07.887 --> 02:02:09.555
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

02:02:09.622 --> 02:02:11.023
IN SMALLER COMMUNITIES IT IS

02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:12.725
OFTEN A LARGE BARRIER FOR PEOPLE

02:02:12.792 --> 02:02:14.560
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS IN

02:02:14.627 --> 02:02:15.995
KINGS COUNTY IT CAN TAKE AN

ENTIRE DAY TO GET TO THE COUNTY

02:02:18.431 --> 02:02:20.599
SEAT USING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

02:02:20.666 --> 02:02:22.868
AND CAN COST NEARLY TEN DOLLARS

02:02:22.935 --> 02:02:25.938
TO TRAVEL BETWEEN CITIES TO

02:02:26.005 --> 02:02:27.506
ACCESS CERTAIN SERVICES.

02:02:27.573 --> 02:02:28.708
WE ALSO HAVE A LACK OF

02:02:28.774 --> 02:02:30.242
MEANINGFUL MEANINGFUL SUPPORTS

02:02:30.309 --> 02:02:31.610

02:02:52.631 --> 02:02:54.366
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS FOR OUR

THE C. O. C. PROCESS WHO HAS

02:02:58.938 --> 02:03:00.406
BEEN A GAME CHANGER FOR OUR

02:03:00.473 --> 02:03:01.574

02:03:13.519 --> 02:03:16.021
BEGINNING TO EMBRACE HOUSING

02:03:16.088 --> 02:03:17.223
FIRST PRINCIPLES.

02:03:17.289 --> 02:03:18.290
I JUST LIKE TO PAUSE THERE

02:03:18.357 --> 02:03:20.092
BECAUSE I FIND THAT TO BE

02:03:20.159 --> 02:03:21.160
AMERICAL.

02:03:21.227 --> 02:03:23.062

THESE FOLKS WOULD HAVE HAD NO

02:03:40.813 --> 02:03:43.916

ROSE TO FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND AND

02:08:04.510 --> 02:08:05.010
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE THOUGHT

02:08:18.657 --> 02:08:20.125
THAN OTHER DEMOGRAPHICS.

02:08:20.192 --> 02:08:20.726
WE CONTINUE TO SEE THE MAIN

02:08:20.793 --> 02:08:22.161
CAUSE OF HOMELESSNESS ATTRIBUTED

02:08:22.227 --> 02:08:23.662

AFFORDABILITY I SHOULD SAY.

02:08:26.899 --> 02:08:28.033
BUT REALIZE THAT THE LONGER

02:08:28.100 --> 02:08:29.668

02:16:27.779 --> 02:16:29.814
WHO ARE EXPERIENCING

02:16:29.881 --> 02:16:31.816
HOMELESSNESS ARE --

02:16:31.883 --> 02:16:34.252
AND IT TAKES A LOT OF WHAT WE

02:16:34.319 --> 02:16:35.687
FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE A LOT OF

02:16:35.754 --> 02:16:38.123
GRASSROOTS DOOR KNOCKING AT

02:16:38.189 --> 02:16:39.658
DIALOGUING TALKING WITH

02:16:39.724 --> 02:16:41.560
COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO ADDRESS

02:16:41.626 --> 02:16:42.928
WHAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE.

02:16:42.994 --> 02:16:47.532
AND I CAN'T OVERSEE IT IS IT IS

02:16:47.599 --> 02:16:49.734
IT INTERESTING BALANCE OF GOING

02:16:49.801 --> 02:16:51.303
OUT TO COMMUNITIES --

02:16:51.369 --> 02:16:53.471
TO ASK FOR THEIR FEET FEEDBACK

02:16:53.538 --> 02:16:55.540
BUT NOT NECESSARILY --

02:16:55.607 --> 02:16:57.909
ASK FOR THEIR PERMISSION AND IT

02:16:57.976 --> 02:16:59.678
IS A DELICATE PLACE TO SAY THERE

02:16:59.744 --> 02:17:01.780
IS A CRISIS AT THE SOLUTION TO

02:17:01.846 --> 02:17:03.448
THE CRISIS IS HOUSING.

02:17:03.515 --> 02:17:05.784
IF NOT HERE THEN WHERE --

02:17:05.850 --> 02:17:06.985
I THINK WHAT WHAT IS ALSO BEEN

02:17:07.052 --> 02:17:08.553
VERY IMPORTANT IS TO POINT OUT

02:17:08.620 --> 02:17:09.854
THAT --

02:17:09.921 --> 02:17:10.855
PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING

02:17:10.922 --> 02:17:11.890
HOMELESSNESS TEND TO STAY IN

02:17:11.957 --> 02:17:14.225
THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEY ARE NOT

02:17:14.292 --> 02:17:15.460
A QUOTE UNQUOTE OUTSIDERS

02:17:15.527 --> 02:17:17.062
PARTICULARLY IN LA THIS IS

02:17:17.128 --> 02:17:18.997
SOMETHING WE ARE CONSTANTLY

02:17:19.064 --> 02:17:20.332
GENTLY EDUCATING OUR

02:17:20.398 --> 02:17:22.901
CONSTITUENTS ON AND THAT THEY

02:17:22.968 --> 02:17:23.401
REALLY ARE ARE HOMELESS

02:17:23.468 --> 02:17:24.235
NEIGHBORS --

02:17:24.302 --> 02:17:26.237
OUR DATA SHOWS THAT THREE OUT OF

02:17:26.304 --> 02:17:29.140
pLOS ANGELES HAVE LIVED IN LOS

02:17:29.207 --> 02:17:31.543
ANGELES FOR TEN YEARS OR LONGER --

02:17:31.610 --> 02:17:33.078
IT SO AT THAT JUST SUPPORTS THE

02:17:33.144 --> 02:17:34.879
ARGUMENT THAT HOUSING NEEDS TO

02:17:34.946 --> 02:17:36.548
BE BILLS WHERE PEOPLE ARE

02:17:36.615 --> 02:17:38.583
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS --

02:17:38.650 --> 02:17:40.585
AND AT AS TO ANY DEGREE THAT THE

02:17:40.652 --> 02:17:42.988
STATE CAN AMPLIFY THAT MESSAGE --

02:17:43.054 --> 02:17:44.990
IT REALLY IT REALLY HAS BECOME

02:17:45.056 --> 02:17:47.158
AN AWARENESS BUILDING CAMPAIGNS

02:17:47.225 --> 02:17:49.427
AROUND ON DEMYSTIFYING THE ISSUE

02:17:49.494 --> 02:17:51.296
OF HOMELESSNESS HUMANIZING WHO

02:17:51.363 --> 02:17:53.164
IS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND

02:17:53.231 --> 02:17:54.265
ALSO TALKING ABOUT.

02:17:54.332 --> 02:17:55.767
OUT WHAT THE BENEFITS OF PERMITS

02:17:55.834 --> 02:17:57.402
SUPPORT OF HOUSING CAN BRING TO

02:17:57.469 --> 02:17:59.037
A NEIGHBORHOOD WE LIKE TO THINK

02:17:59.104 --> 02:18:01.272
OF PSH AS AN ASSET TO THE

02:18:01.339 --> 02:18:06.244
NEIGHBORHOOD ASSET IS NOT A BIRD

02:18:06.311 --> 02:18:06.845
IN A NEIGHBORHOOD IN THE HOUSE

02:18:06.911 --> 02:18:09.881
TO BEAR SMALL GROUPS.

02:18:09.948 --> 02:18:12.917
ADD JUST A FACE TO FACE DIALOGUE --

02:18:12.984 --> 02:18:14.319
AT THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE

02:18:14.386 --> 02:18:16.388
CAN MAKE THE MOST HAD WAY WITH

02:18:16.454 --> 02:18:18.623
WITH COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

02:18:18.690 --> 02:18:20.325
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:18:20.392 --> 02:18:23.028
MS QUIRK SILVA.

02:18:23.094 --> 02:18:24.596
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR

02:18:24.663 --> 02:18:25.830
TESTIMONY --

02:18:25.897 --> 02:18:27.532
I DO AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU

02:18:27.599 --> 02:18:30.402
JUST SAID ABOUT IN ROLLING THE

02:18:30.468 --> 02:18:32.303
COMMUNITY INTO WHATEVER TYPE OF

02:18:32.370 --> 02:18:34.039
PROJECT IS WHETHER IT'S A MARKET

02:18:34.105 --> 02:18:34.773
RATE.

02:18:34.839 --> 02:18:37.042
WHETHER IT'S AN AFFORDABLE

02:18:37.108 --> 02:18:39.044
WHETHER IT'S AN EMERGENCY

02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:41.479
SHELTER ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AS

02:18:41.546 --> 02:18:42.747
YOU KNOW IS NOW WITH SOCIAL

02:18:42.814 --> 02:18:45.050
MEDIA YOU HAVE NEXT DOOR.

02:18:45.116 --> 02:18:47.719
AND EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE AN

02:18:47.786 --> 02:18:50.088
ENGAGEMENT ON THESE SOCIAL MEDIA

02:18:50.155 --> 02:18:52.657
PLATFORMS AND PEOPLE TRY TO

02:18:52.724 --> 02:18:54.292
EDUCATE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

02:18:54.359 --> 02:18:56.494
PERMANENT HOUSING AND EMERGENCY

02:18:56.561 --> 02:18:57.395
SHELTER.

02:18:57.462 --> 02:18:59.130
THERE ARE SOME THAT JUST

02:18:59.197 --> 02:19:01.166
ABSOLUTELY DO NOT WANT THE

02:19:01.232 --> 02:19:04.602
INFORMATION AND CHARACTERIZE IT

02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:06.204
AS IN OR BRING IN ALL THE

02:19:06.271 --> 02:19:07.405
HOMELESS --

02:19:07.472 --> 02:19:09.674
ADDICTED PEOPLE TO WHEREVER THE

02:19:09.741 --> 02:19:12.711
COMMUNITY AS AND WHEN WE LOOK AT

02:19:12.777 --> 02:19:15.146
LOCAL WHERE MOST OF THESE

02:19:15.213 --> 02:19:16.481
DECISIONS ARE MADE LOCAL

02:19:16.548 --> 02:19:18.717
GOVERNMENT CITY COUNCIL--

02:19:18.783 --> 02:19:21.352
LEVELS WE CONTINUE TO SEE THAT

02:19:21.419 --> 02:19:23.621
WHEN PEOPLE COME OUT TO

02:19:23.688 --> 02:19:26.124
COUNSEL'S OF IT WHETHER IT'S A

02:19:26.191 --> 02:19:27.826
HUNDRED AND FIFTY OR TWO HUNDRED

02:19:27.892 --> 02:19:30.862
PEOPLE COUNCILS OF VEER TOWARDS

02:19:30.929 --> 02:19:32.097
SAYING NO.

02:19:32.163 --> 02:19:34.065
AND WHEN THEY SAY NO THESE

02:19:34.132 --> 02:19:35.366
PROJECTS THEN --

02:19:35.433 --> 02:19:38.269
GO BACK TO THE TABLE AND OFTEN

02:19:38.336 --> 02:19:40.505
CAN TAKE ANOTHER TWO YEARS THREE

02:19:40.572 --> 02:19:42.807
YEARS -- TO

02:19:42.874 --> 02:19:45.944
TO MOVE FORWARD WE LOOK AT THE

02:19:46.010 --> 02:19:47.846
FUNDING COMING IN FROM THE STATE

02:19:47.912 --> 02:19:49.280
WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

02:19:49.347 --> 02:19:51.316
TRYING TO DO TO ADDRESS THE

02:19:51.382 --> 02:19:52.717
ISSUES WERE STUCK.

02:19:52.784 --> 02:19:54.886
IN MANY WAYS NOT ONLY WITH THE

02:19:54.953 --> 02:19:57.088
NIMBIS BUT COUNCIL MEMBERS THAT

02:19:57.155 --> 02:19:59.524
ARE REFUSING TO DO THEIR JOB

02:19:59.591 --> 02:20:01.559
WHICH IS TO VOTE TO MOVE FORWARD

02:20:01.626 --> 02:20:03.328
A PROJECT --

02:20:03.394 --> 02:20:05.230
AND I KNOW --

02:20:05.296 --> 02:20:07.699
THERE'S A LOT STATED ABOUT.

02:20:07.766 --> 02:20:10.735
LOCAL CONTROL AND LOCAL COUNCILS

02:20:10.802 --> 02:20:12.937
NEED TO HAVE THEIR AUTHORITY AND

02:20:13.004 --> 02:20:14.272
THE STATE.

02:20:14.339 --> 02:20:17.408
SHOULD STAY OUT OF IT AND COMING

02:20:17.475 --> 02:20:19.577
FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT MYSELF FOR

02:20:19.644 --> 02:20:21.546
EIGHT YEARS IT'S ALMOST A NO WIN

02:20:21.613 --> 02:20:23.748
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS IF THERE'S

02:20:23.815 --> 02:20:25.083
SOMETHING.

02:20:25.150 --> 02:20:27.152
THAT HAPPENS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

02:20:27.218 --> 02:20:28.820
THAT'S POSITIVE THE LOCAL

02:20:28.887 --> 02:20:30.455
GOVERNMENT DOESN'T USUALLY GIVE

02:20:30.522 --> 02:20:32.357
PRAISE TO THE STATE IF THEY'VE

02:20:32.423 --> 02:20:33.892
PLAYED A ROLE BUT IF THERE'S

02:20:33.958 --> 02:20:35.460
SOMETHING NEGATIVE THEN THE

02:20:35.527 --> 02:20:36.628
STATE GETS BLAMED.

02:20:36.694 --> 02:20:41.332
SO I'M DEFINITELY OF THE THE

02:20:41.399 --> 02:20:44.369
MOOD THAT WE DO HAVE TO PLAY A A

02:20:44.435 --> 02:20:46.337
MORE DELIBERATE ROLE.

02:20:46.404 --> 02:20:48.640
AND IF THE LOCAL ONE GOVERNMENT

02:20:48.706 --> 02:20:50.074
IS NOT GOING.

02:20:50.141 --> 02:20:52.210
TO DO THEIR JOB.

02:20:52.277 --> 02:20:54.312
AND ADDRESS THIS THAN THE STATE

02:20:54.379 --> 02:20:56.447
AS THE GOVERNOR SAYING SAID IS

02:20:56.514 --> 02:20:58.683
GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT IT IN A

02:20:58.750 --> 02:21:00.652
MORE SERIOUS WAY OF STEPPING END

02:21:00.718 --> 02:21:02.287
BECAUSE WE CANNOT.

02:21:02.353 --> 02:21:04.422
CONTINUE TO SAY NO WHEN EVERY

02:21:04.489 --> 02:21:06.791
EXCUSES RUN OUT MEANING THERE

02:21:06.858 --> 02:21:08.293
ARE NOW FUNDS COMING IN BECAUSE

02:21:08.359 --> 02:21:09.394
BEFORE IT WAS THERE WERE NO

02:21:09.460 --> 02:21:11.129
FUNDS WE CAN'T DO THIS OR WE

02:21:11.196 --> 02:21:12.630
LOST REDEVELOPMENT.

02:21:12.697 --> 02:21:14.465
AND ALL OF THESE THINGS AND

02:21:14.532 --> 02:21:16.935
EXCUSE AFTER EXCUSE WELL WE SEE

02:21:17.001 --> 02:21:19.370
PEOPLE SITTING ON OUR STREETS SO --

02:21:19.437 --> 02:21:21.973
I'M GOING TO BE MOVING FORWARD --

02:21:22.040 --> 02:21:25.276
A PACKAGE OF BILLS AND I'M

02:21:25.343 --> 02:21:26.377
ASSUMING THEY'LL BE QUITE A BIT

02:21:26.444 --> 02:21:28.913
OF CRITICISM BUT THE POINT IS WE

02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:30.782
HAVE TO BUILD HOUSING WE DON'T

02:21:30.849 --> 02:21:32.917
BUILD HOUSING --

02:21:32.984 --> 02:21:34.586
WE ARE NOT CAN BE ABLE TO

02:21:34.652 --> 02:21:35.920
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

02:21:35.987 --> 02:21:37.922
I DON'T THINK I HAVE A QUESTION

02:21:37.989 --> 02:21:38.489
IN THERE I THINK THAT WAS A

02:21:38.556 --> 02:21:43.061
REALLY BUT THANK YOU.

02:21:43.127 --> 02:21:44.562

MAY BE THE ONLY ONE WHO ACTUALLY

02:21:54.973 --> 02:21:56.307
SPEND THE NIGHT WITH HOMELESS

02:21:56.374 --> 02:21:58.243
INDIVIDUALS IN LOS ANGELES I

02:21:58.309 --> 02:22:00.044

CERTAINLY HAVE WE KNOW IT IS A

02:32:23.133 --> 02:32:24.902
VERY LARGE NUMBER EVEN A IN A

02:32:24.969 --> 02:32:27.905
COUNTY OF TEN MILLION PEOPLE.

02:32:27.972 --> 02:32:28.806
FIFTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE WITH A

02:32:28.873 --> 02:32:30.975
LOT OF PEOPLE ON THE STREETS AND

02:32:31.041 --> 02:32:33.210
CERTAINLY WE AIM TO GET TO A

02:32:33.277 --> 02:32:35.513
FUNCTIONAL ZERO WHICH IS THE YOU

02:32:35.579 --> 02:32:36.981
KNOW THE INFLOW MATCHES THE

02:32:37.047 --> 02:32:38.382
OUTFLOW IN PEOPLE RESOLVE

02:32:38.449 --> 02:32:40.184
HOMELESSNESS QUICKLY --

02:32:40.251 --> 02:32:40.885
YOU KNOW.

02:32:40.951 --> 02:32:42.953
YESTERDAY AND THE MAYOR HAS

02:32:43.020 --> 02:32:44.488
SPECIFICALLY MADE A GOAL AROUND

02:32:44.555 --> 02:32:47.992
ST HOMELESSNESS SO SPECIFICALLY

02:32:48.058 --> 02:32:48.826
PEOPLE WERE LIVING.

02:32:48.893 --> 02:32:50.995
LITERALLY ON THE STREETS THAT WE

02:32:51.061 --> 02:32:52.630
WOULD AT CUT STREET ALMOST AS IN

02:32:52.696 --> 02:32:54.865
THE CITY BY HALF I'M IN AND

02:32:54.932 --> 02:32:55.866
STREET HOMELESSNESS OR GET TO

02:32:55.933 --> 02:32:57.268
FUNCTIONAL LEVEL FUNCTIONAL ZERO

02:32:57.334 --> 02:32:57.735
LEVEL.

02:32:57.801 --> 02:33:00.604
AND IN TEN YEARS AND THIS IS

02:33:00.671 --> 02:33:02.206
THIS IS NO EASY FEAT --

02:33:02.273 --> 02:33:03.707
ONE BECAUSE THREE OUT OF FOUR

02:33:03.774 --> 02:33:05.409
PEOPLE WHO ARE HOMELESS AND LA

02:33:05.476 --> 02:33:07.311
ARE AND SHELTERED THEY'RE LIVING

02:33:07.378 --> 02:33:09.813
LITERALLY ON THE SIDEWALKS.

02:33:09.880 --> 02:33:12.983
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS SICK.

02:33:13.050 --> 02:33:15.953
DESPITE OUTSIDE ON THIS IS

02:33:16.020 --> 02:33:17.588
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH

02:33:17.655 --> 02:33:19.123
INDOOR PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO GO

02:33:19.189 --> 02:33:20.357
INTO ROUND PERMANENT OR

02:33:20.424 --> 02:33:22.326
OTHERWISE I'M SO REALLY THAT

02:33:22.393 --> 02:33:23.761
THAT IS THE SOLUTION AND SCALING

02:33:23.827 --> 02:33:25.529
UP THAT SOLUTION QUICKLY --

02:33:25.596 --> 02:33:27.598
IS IS A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR

02:33:27.665 --> 02:33:30.434
RESPONSE AND I'D ALSO SAY THAT

02:33:30.501 --> 02:33:32.169

WE'VE SPENT DECADES --

02:33:35.539 --> 02:33:36.974
LETTING THE CRISIS GET TO THIS

02:33:37.041 --> 02:33:39.176
LEVEL I'M AND IT IS JUST IN THE

02:33:39.243 --> 02:33:40.911
LAST TWO YEARS THAT WE HAVE

02:33:40.978 --> 02:33:42.313
STARTED TO FIND.

02:33:42.379 --> 02:33:43.948
THE SOLUTIONS THAT ALMOST THE

02:33:44.014 --> 02:33:44.848
RATE THAT THEY NEED TO BE FUNDED

02:33:44.915 --> 02:33:46.317
THERE THERE IS STILL A BIT OF A

02:33:46.383 --> 02:33:47.518
GAP IN TERMS OF OUR FUNDING AND

02:33:47.585 --> 02:33:49.153
THAT IS WHERE HE DOLLARS HAVE

02:33:49.219 --> 02:33:49.787
BECOME.

02:33:49.853 --> 02:33:51.655
AN INCREDIBLY IMPACTFUL

02:33:51.722 --> 02:33:53.190
ESPECIALLY --

02:33:59.263 --> 02:34:00.898
BUT WE HAVE JUST STARTED TO DO

02:34:00.965 --> 02:34:02.733
THE WORK THAT WE PROBABLY SHOULD

02:34:02.800 --> 02:34:04.234
HAVE BEEN DOING ALL ALONG.

02:34:04.301 --> 02:34:06.003
I'M AND THIS IS AGAIN I THINK

02:34:06.070 --> 02:34:06.670
SOME DECIDED I THINK OTHERS HAVE

02:34:06.737 --> 02:34:09.273
SAID IT WE NEED TO FIND A SYSTEM

02:34:09.340 --> 02:34:11.875
THAT CREATES SYSTEM FLOW.

02:34:11.942 --> 02:34:13.677
INPUT AND OUTPUT QUICKLY --

02:34:13.744 --> 02:34:15.412
IF WE WERE TO FOCUS ON JUST ONE

02:34:15.479 --> 02:34:16.981
PIECE OF THE SYSTEM I. E.

02:34:17.047 --> 02:34:19.516
SHELTERS OR INTERIM SOLUTIONS WE

02:34:19.583 --> 02:34:20.351

WE NEED A TO PERMANENTLY AND

02:34:22.152 --> 02:34:23.220
SOMEONE'S HOMELESSNESS.

02:34:23.287 --> 02:34:25.422
AND IF WE'RE NOT CREATING ENOUGH

02:34:25.489 --> 02:34:30.761
AT PATHWAYS INTO THE SYSTEM --

02:34:30.828 --> 02:34:33.697
I EAT OUTREACH WORKERS GOING

02:34:33.764 --> 02:34:35.199
FIGURATIVELY WHERE THEY ARE --

FIND OUT WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE

02:34:37.668 --> 02:34:39.937

QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT IT'S AS OUR

02:38:27.097 --> 02:38:29.132
ARE A TRY TO ASK WHETHER THIS IS

02:38:29.199 --> 02:38:31.869
GOING TO BE A LOCAL DECISION ON

02:38:31.935 --> 02:38:35.939
WAS STATE LEVEL --

02:38:36.006 --> 02:38:37.741
ONE OF THE PROFESSORS SO WHO

02:38:37.808 --> 02:38:39.810
LIVED IN NOT ON CHINA FOR A LONG

02:38:39.877 --> 02:38:41.445

INTO ON THE SHOW BUT THE BASIC

02:39:07.571 --> 02:39:09.840
IDEA WAS THAT THE A PRIVATE

02:44:56.586 --> 02:44:58.121
CALIFORNIA IS NOW LEADING IN

02:44:58.188 --> 02:44:59.689
CAPITAL FUNDING TO CREATE

02:44:59.756 --> 02:45:01.124
SUPPORT OF HOUSING.

02:45:01.191 --> 02:45:03.360
BETWEEN PROPOSITIONS ONE INTO

02:45:03.426 --> 02:45:04.561
AND WITH THE HOPE OF ADDITIONAL

02:45:04.628 --> 02:45:06.730
RESOURCES FOR STATE LOW INCOME

02:45:06.796 --> 02:45:08.265
HOUSING TAX CREDITS.

02:45:08.331 --> 02:45:09.065
WE WILL HAVE ENOUGH CAPITAL FOR

02:45:09.132 --> 02:45:10.734
DEVELOPERS --

02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:12.636
CAPACITY.

02:45:12.702 --> 02:45:14.804
CAPITAL IS NOT HOWEVER THE ONLY

02:45:14.871 --> 02:45:17.007
TYPE OF FUNDING NEEDED TO CREATE

02:45:17.073 --> 02:45:18.575
MORE SUPPORT HOUSING.

02:45:18.642 --> 02:45:19.876
BECAUSE PEOPLE EXPERIENCING

02:45:19.943 --> 02:45:21.645
HOMELESSNESS ESPECIALLY CHRONIC

02:45:21.711 --> 02:45:23.346
HOMELESSNESS CANNOT AFFORD TO

02:45:23.413 --> 02:45:25.415
PAY ENOUGH RENT FOR DEVELOPER TO

02:45:25.482 --> 02:45:27.350
OPERATE A BUILDING WE ALSO NEED

02:45:27.417 --> 02:45:28.818
TO PAY FOR OPERATING COSTS FOR

02:45:28.885 --> 02:45:30.287
UTILITIES MAINTENANCE AND

02:45:30.353 --> 02:45:32.022
REPAIRS.

02:45:32.088 --> 02:45:33.757
DEVELOPERS HAVE TYPICALLY RELIED

02:45:33.823 --> 02:45:35.292
ON HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHERS ARE

02:45:35.358 --> 02:45:36.826
SECTION EIGHT FOR THIS PURPOSE

02:45:36.893 --> 02:45:38.895
BUT WE WON'T HAVE NEARLY ENOUGH

02:45:38.962 --> 02:45:40.830
OF THOSE RESOURCES. TO OPERATE

02:45:40.897 --> 02:45:42.532
BUILDING STATE PROGRAMS --

02:45:42.599 --> 02:45:43.767
ARE BEING ARE GOING TO BE

02:45:43.833 --> 02:45:46.102
CREATING. FOR PEOPLE

02:45:46.169 --> 02:45:47.570
EXPERIENCING CHRONIC OR FREQUENT

02:45:47.637 --> 02:45:48.905
HOMELESSNESS WE ALSO NEED

02:45:48.972 --> 02:45:50.840
FUNDING FOR SERVICES FOR SUPPORT

02:45:50.907 --> 02:45:52.676
OF HOUSING TENANTS JERMAINE

02:45:52.742 --> 02:45:53.810
STATELY HOUSE.

02:45:53.877 --> 02:45:54.978
MEDI CAL AND MENTAL HEALTH

02:45:55.045 --> 02:45:57.147
SERVICES ACT PROVIDE FUNDING BUT

02:45:57.213 --> 02:45:59.049
THESE PROGRAMS ARE INSUFFICIENT

02:45:59.115 --> 02:46:00.450
TO OFFER THE INTENT SERVICES

02:46:00.517 --> 02:46:03.119
SUPPORT OF HOUSING TENANTS NEED.

02:46:03.186 --> 02:46:04.954
WE ALSO CANNOT HOPE TO SOLVE

02:46:05.021 --> 02:46:06.323
HOMELESSNESS BY BUILDING ALONE

02:46:06.389 --> 02:46:08.058
IT TAKES YEARS AND SOME

02:46:08.124 --> 02:46:10.260
COMMUNITIES LACK THE DEVELOPER

02:46:10.327 --> 02:46:12.262
CAPACITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

02:46:12.329 --> 02:46:13.630
CAPITAL FUNDING.

02:46:13.697 --> 02:46:15.665
SO I WOULD SAY OUR BIGGEST GAP

02:46:15.732 --> 02:46:17.434
IS INCOME FUNDING RENTAL

02:46:17.500 --> 02:46:19.969
ASSISTANCE TO GET OF PEOPLE

02:46:20.036 --> 02:46:21.638
HOUSED WITH PRIVATE MARKET

02:46:21.705 --> 02:46:23.106
LANDLORDS ALONG WITH PASSING NEW

02:46:23.173 --> 02:46:25.475
LAWS PROHIBITING SOURCE OF

02:46:25.542 --> 02:46:27.344
INCOME DISCRIMINATION.

02:46:27.410 --> 02:46:28.945
LOS ANGELES COUNTY --

02:46:29.012 --> 02:46:30.747
THE FRESNO HOUSING AUTHORITY AND

02:46:30.814 --> 02:46:32.515
THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAVE

02:46:32.582 --> 02:46:34.351
ALL USE RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO

02:46:34.417 --> 02:46:35.518
MOVE THOUSANDS FROM STREETS TO

02:46:35.585 --> 02:46:37.320
HOMES.

02:46:37.387 --> 02:46:39.122
CREATING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:46:39.189 --> 02:46:41.024
IS ALSO CRITICAL TO SOLVING

02:46:41.091 --> 02:46:42.359
HOMELESSNESS AS MOST PEOPLE

02:46:42.425 --> 02:46:43.760
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS DON'T

02:46:43.827 --> 02:46:45.128
NEED SUPPORT OF HOUSING THEY

02:46:45.195 --> 02:46:47.731
SIMPLY NEED AN AFFORDABLE PLACE

02:46:47.797 --> 02:46:49.199
TO LIVE TAX OF HOMELESSNESS.

02:46:49.265 --> 02:46:50.367
THE PROBLEM IS THAT MOST

02:46:50.433 --> 02:46:51.901
HOMELESS PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD

02:46:51.968 --> 02:46:53.636
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

02:46:53.703 --> 02:46:55.205
CALIFORNIA SUBSIDIZES.

02:46:55.271 --> 02:46:57.006
EVEN FOR HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WITH

02:46:57.073 --> 02:46:58.875
INCOMES THAT 30% OF AN AREAS

02:46:58.942 --> 02:47:01.111
MEDIAN INCOME CANNOT AFFORD THAT

02:47:01.177 --> 02:47:03.012
HOUSING.

02:47:03.079 --> 02:47:04.381
CALIFORNIA COULD REQUIRE ARE

02:47:04.447 --> 02:47:06.483
PROJECTS RECEIVING STATE FUNDING

02:47:06.549 --> 02:47:08.418
TO INCLUDE A PERCENTAGE OR

02:47:08.485 --> 02:47:09.953
NUMBER OF UNITS THAT WOULD

02:47:10.019 --> 02:47:11.554
TARGET SPECIFICALLY PEOPLE

02:47:11.621 --> 02:47:13.323
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS OR SET

02:47:13.390 --> 02:47:15.058
ASIDE THOSE UNITS.

02:47:15.125 --> 02:47:15.859
WE COULD --

02:47:15.925 --> 02:47:18.061
TIE FUNDING FOR RAPID RE HOUSING

02:47:18.128 --> 02:47:19.195
TO THESE AFFORDABLE UNITS TO

02:47:19.262 --> 02:47:22.265
HELP THOSE HOUSEHOLDS PAY RENT.

02:47:22.332 --> 02:47:24.401
THE STATE COULD ALSO PROVIDE --

02:47:24.467 --> 02:47:25.602
OPERATING SUBSIDIES TO

02:47:25.668 --> 02:47:27.103
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS

02:47:27.170 --> 02:47:29.105
FOR THIS PURPOSE.

02:47:29.172 --> 02:47:30.807
CALIFORNIA SHOULD ALSO LEAD IN

02:47:30.874 --> 02:47:32.742
CHANGING SYSTEMS THAT CONTRIBUTE

02:47:32.809 --> 02:47:34.310
TO HOMELESSNESS --

02:47:34.377 --> 02:47:35.745
SYSTEMS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO

02:47:35.812 --> 02:47:36.913
HOMELESSNESS AND BEAR THE

02:47:36.980 --> 02:47:39.382
BIGGEST COSTS CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:47:39.449 --> 02:47:40.884
CHILD WELFARE AND OUR HEALTH

02:47:40.950 --> 02:47:42.018
CARE SYSTEMS.

02:47:42.085 --> 02:47:42.552
SHOULD ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO

02:47:42.619 --> 02:47:46.589
SOLUTION FOR WAYS.

02:47:46.656 --> 02:47:47.690
THERE ARE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH

02:47:47.757 --> 02:47:49.426
CARE SERVICES HAS MADE STRIDES

02:47:49.492 --> 02:47:51.227
IN FUNDING SERVICES TO HELP

02:47:51.294 --> 02:47:53.296
PEOPLE OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN

02:47:53.363 --> 02:47:54.364
HOUSING.

02:47:54.431 --> 02:47:56.099
ARE MEDI CAL SYSTEM HAS A LONG

02:47:56.166 --> 02:47:58.268
WAY TO GO AND MAKING ACCESS TO

02:47:58.334 --> 02:48:00.203
SERVICES SEAMLESS FOR PEOPLE

02:48:00.270 --> 02:48:01.871
EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS.

02:48:01.938 --> 02:48:05.341
AND IN OF INTEGRATING THOSE

02:48:05.408 --> 02:48:07.143
SERVICES WITH THE HOUSING.

02:48:07.210 --> 02:48:09.279
OUR PRO PRAGUE PROGRAMS TEND TO

02:48:09.345 --> 02:48:11.247
ADD BARRIERS RATHER THAN REMOVE

02:48:11.314 --> 02:48:13.216
THEM AND GETTING PEOPLE --

02:48:13.283 --> 02:48:15.118
WERE ON PAROLE HOUSE EVEN THOUGH

02:48:15.185 --> 02:48:16.653
FOR ALL THESE ARE BOTH MUCH MORE

02:48:16.719 --> 02:48:18.054
LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE

02:48:18.121 --> 02:48:19.122
HOMELESSNESS WHEN THEY EXIT

02:48:19.189 --> 02:48:22.358
PRISM AND MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE

02:48:22.425 --> 02:48:22.892
SET OF EIGHT WHEN THEY'RE

02:48:22.959 --> 02:48:24.160
HOMELESS.

02:48:24.227 --> 02:48:25.261
THESE FOCUS SHOULD --

02:48:25.328 --> 02:48:27.597
THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE REFORM TO

02:48:27.664 --> 02:48:30.834
ADOPT HOUSING FIRST APPROACHES.

02:48:30.900 --> 02:48:32.735
CALIFORNIA CAN ALSO LEAD AND

02:48:32.802 --> 02:48:34.771
RESPONSE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT

02:48:34.838 --> 02:48:36.206
CALLS FOR SHELTER FUNDING.

02:48:36.272 --> 02:48:38.107
A SHELTER ONLY STRATEGY WON'T

02:48:38.174 --> 02:48:39.642
SOLVE HOMELESSNESS IN FACT

02:48:39.709 --> 02:48:40.743
PEOPLE ARE STILL CONSIDERED

02:48:40.810 --> 02:48:42.512
HOMELESS WHEN IN SHELTERS AND

02:48:42.579 --> 02:48:43.580
SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE

02:48:43.646 --> 02:48:45.215
POPULATIONS NEVER ACCESS

02:48:45.281 --> 02:48:47.016
SHELTERS.

02:48:47.083 --> 02:48:48.384
IS SHELL TO RESIDENTS CANNOT

02:48:48.451 --> 02:48:50.854
ACCESS EXIT TO PERMANENT HOUSING

02:48:50.920 --> 02:48:51.855
AS MENTIONED IN THE PREVIOUS

02:48:51.921 --> 02:48:53.389
PANEL.

02:48:53.456 --> 02:48:54.757
THEY WILL CERTAINLY CYCLE BACK

02:48:54.824 --> 02:48:56.759
TO THE STREETS AND FOR THIS

02:48:56.826 --> 02:48:59.095
REASON WHILE WE DO AGREE THAT

02:48:59.162 --> 02:49:01.064
THE STATE SHOULD ALLOW --

02:49:01.130 --> 02:49:02.832

02:49:02.899 --> 02:49:04.501

02:49:06.636 --> 02:49:07.770
RESPITE CARE.

02:49:07.837 --> 02:49:09.105
THIS FUNDING SHOULD BE

02:49:09.172 --> 02:49:11.474
ACCOMPANIED BY SERVICES AND

02:49:11.541 --> 02:49:14.043
HOUSING TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO HAVE

02:49:16.045 --> 02:49:17.280
HOUSING.

02:49:17.347 --> 02:49:18.748
FINALLY INTERIM INTERVENTIONS

02:49:18.815 --> 02:49:20.383
SHOULD BE LOW BARRIER I

02:49:20.450 --> 02:49:22.185
COMPLETELY AGREE WITH --

TO SUM UP THOUGH CALIFORNIA'S

02:49:26.756 --> 02:49:27.991
TAKEN STRIDES TO SOLVE

02:49:28.057 --> 02:49:30.727
HOMELESSNESS WE NEED LEADERSHIP.

02:49:30.793 --> 02:49:31.895
ON A NUMBER OF WAYS.

02:49:31.961 --> 02:49:34.731
FIRST --

02:49:34.797 --> 02:49:36.399
CHANGE THE DIALOGUE FROM WHAT WE

02:49:36.466 --> 02:49:38.368
CAN GETS WHAT'S NEEDED TO SOLVE

02:49:38.434 --> 02:49:40.336
HOMELESSNESS AND THIS REQUIRES A

02:49:40.403 --> 02:49:41.905
NEEDS ANALYSIS.

02:49:41.971 --> 02:49:43.206
INVESTMENT SHOULD FOCUS ON

02:49:43.273 --> 02:49:44.741
FILLING GAPS IN GETTING PEOPLE

02:49:44.807 --> 02:49:46.576

AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACCESSIBLE TO

02:49:52.482 --> 02:49:55.518
PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS.

02:49:55.585 --> 02:49:56.953
WE SHOULD CREATE PARTNERSHIPS

02:49:57.020 --> 02:49:58.688
BETWEEN STATE SYSTEMS AND OUR

02:49:58.755 --> 02:50:00.623

A FOSTER COLLABORATION LOCALLY.

02:50:03.860 --> 02:50:05.228
FINALLY WE SHOULD FOCUS OUR

02:50:05.295 --> 02:50:07.330
RESOURCES ON ALLOWING PEOPLE TO

02:50:07.397 --> 02:50:08.898

FIFTY SIX ARE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:51:22.839 --> 02:51:23.873
SIMPLY PUT WE BELIEVE THAT

02:51:23.940 --> 02:51:25.675
PHILANTHROPY HAS AN IMPORTANT

02:51:25.742 --> 02:51:27.610
ROLE IN EFFORTS TO END AND

02:51:27.677 --> 02:51:29.212
PREVENT HOMELESSNESS.

02:51:29.278 --> 02:51:30.680
BUT WE CERTAINLY CAN'T DO IT

02:51:30.747 --> 02:51:31.981
ALONE OUT.

02:51:32.048 --> 02:51:33.883
THERE WAS A COMMENT EARLIER

02:51:33.950 --> 02:51:34.350
ABOUT PUBLIC PRIVATE

OF THOSE AND AS SPEAKING FROM

PHILANTHROPY BUT GOVERNMENT IS A

02:51:40.023 --> 02:51:41.824
KEY PARTNER FOR US.

THREE LESSONS WHICH YOU'VE

02:51:57.640 --> 02:51:58.541
ALREADY HEARD ABOUT THAT I THINK

02:51:58.608 --> 02:51:58.875
ARE.

02:51:58.941 --> 02:52:01.911
ARE ARE BEAR REPEATING FIRST AND

02:52:01.978 --> 02:52:04.047
MOST IMPORTANTLY WE KNOW --

02:52:04.113 --> 02:52:04.847
HAS HAS BEEN REFERENCED SEVERAL

02:52:04.914 --> 02:52:06.983
TIMES TODAY THAT THE SOLUTION TO

02:52:07.050 --> 02:52:08.885
HOMELESSNESS IS HOUSING.

02:52:08.951 --> 02:52:10.620
DATING EXPERIENCE SHOW THAT

02:52:10.687 --> 02:52:12.155
HOUSING FIRST APPROACH SUPPORT

02:52:12.221 --> 02:52:13.222
OF HOUSING.

02:52:13.289 --> 02:52:15.324
OR RAPID RE HOUSING MUST BE THE

02:52:15.391 --> 02:52:16.626
SET AT THE CENTER OF ANY

02:52:16.693 --> 02:52:18.261
COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TENDING

02:52:18.327 --> 02:52:19.696
HOMELESSNESS --

02:52:19.762 --> 02:52:21.464
EMERGENCY SHELTER NEEDS TO BE

02:52:21.531 --> 02:52:23.232
PART AS PART OF A CRISIS

02:52:23.299 --> 02:52:24.667
RESPONSE SYSTEM TO MAKE

02:52:24.734 --> 02:52:26.269
HOMELESSNESS RARE BRIEF AND NON

02:52:26.335 --> 02:52:27.904
RECURRING.

02:52:27.970 --> 02:52:29.305
BUT IN ITSELF IT'S NOT A

02:52:29.372 --> 02:52:30.406
SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS HAS

02:52:30.473 --> 02:52:31.274
BEEN ROUGH AS HAS BEEN

02:52:31.340 --> 02:52:33.009
REFERENCED EARLIER.

02:52:33.076 --> 02:52:34.677
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ARE

02:52:34.744 --> 02:52:36.779
ALSO VERY IMPORTANT SUPPORTS TO

02:52:36.846 --> 02:52:37.780
HELP ME PEOPLE ADDRESS THE

02:52:37.847 --> 02:52:39.048
ISSUES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE

02:52:39.115 --> 02:52:40.516
HOMELESSNESS BUT IN AND OF

02:52:40.583 --> 02:52:41.918
THEMSELVES ARE NOT COMPLETE

02:52:41.984 --> 02:52:42.685
SOLUTIONS.

02:52:42.752 --> 02:52:43.586
EITHER.

02:52:43.653 --> 02:52:44.887
ONLY PROVIDING ACCESS TO PERMIT

02:52:44.954 --> 02:52:47.557
HOUSING WITH NECESSARY SUPPORTS

02:52:47.623 --> 02:52:49.258
CAN TRULY AND HOMELESSNESS.

02:52:49.325 --> 02:52:51.227
OUR GRANTEES FIND THAT OVER WELL

02:52:51.294 --> 02:52:53.463
OVER 90% OF PEOPLE WHO WERE

02:52:53.529 --> 02:52:54.697
PLACED IN A PERMITS PART OF

02:52:54.764 --> 02:52:56.566
HOUSING FOR EXAMPLE REMAIN HOUSE

02:52:56.632 --> 02:52:57.800
A YEAR OR MORE.

02:52:57.867 --> 02:52:59.736
LATER SUPPORT SUPPORT OF HOUSING

02:52:59.802 --> 02:53:00.937
WORKS.

02:53:01.003 --> 02:53:02.071
WE FIND ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDE

02:53:02.138 --> 02:53:03.706
BOTH SINGLE SITE HOUSING MEANING

02:53:03.773 --> 02:53:05.241
DEVELOPMENTS AND OFTEN NEW

02:53:05.308 --> 02:53:06.409
DEVELOPMENTS.

02:53:06.476 --> 02:53:07.977
ARE VERY NICE DEVELOPMENTS OF OF

02:53:08.044 --> 02:53:10.480
HOUSING AND ALSO SCATTERED SAID.

02:53:10.546 --> 02:53:12.381
SO EXCEPT EXISTING HOUSING IS A

02:53:12.448 --> 02:53:14.150
RENTAL SUBSIDIES WE OFTEN GET

02:53:14.217 --> 02:53:16.152
ASKED WHICH IS BETTER A SINGLE

02:53:16.219 --> 02:53:17.754
SITE TO BE BUILDING NEW HOUSING

02:53:17.820 --> 02:53:19.555
SHOULD WE BE USING THE EXISTING

02:53:19.622 --> 02:53:21.023
HOUSING MARKET.

02:53:21.090 --> 02:53:24.927
THE ANSWER IS YES WE NEED BOTH --

02:53:24.994 --> 02:53:26.896
AND WE NEED MORE.

02:53:26.963 --> 02:53:27.997
AS PEOPLE COME WITH VARIOUS

02:53:28.064 --> 02:53:29.232
NEEDS -- AND

02:53:29.298 --> 02:53:30.867
COMMUNITIES COME WITH VARIOUS

02:53:30.933 --> 02:53:32.201
OPPORTUNITIES AND BARRIERS WHICH

02:53:32.268 --> 02:53:33.069
WE'VE HEARD.

02:53:33.136 --> 02:53:34.237
BUT THE SIMPLE FACT IS WE NEED

02:53:34.303 --> 02:53:35.705
MORE HOUSING.

02:53:35.772 --> 02:53:36.539
AVAILABLE TO HELP PEOPLE WHO

02:53:36.606 --> 02:53:38.908
HAVE BEEN HOMELESS STE OIL.

02:53:38.975 --> 02:53:41.177
AND THRIVE.

02:53:41.244 --> 02:53:42.745
A SECOND LESSON WE LEARNED IS

02:53:42.812 --> 02:53:44.313
THAT HOMELESSNESS IS A CROSS

02:53:44.380 --> 02:53:45.681
SECTOR PROBLEM.

02:53:45.748 --> 02:53:47.550
AND IT THEREFORE REQUIRES CROSS

02:53:47.617 --> 02:53:49.285
SECTOR SOLUTIONS.

02:53:49.352 --> 02:53:51.087
BECAUSE OF HOMELESSNESS ARE MANY

02:53:51.154 --> 02:53:53.856
JOB LOSS EVICTIONS HEALTH CRISES

02:53:53.923 --> 02:53:56.259
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCARCERATION.

02:53:56.325 --> 02:53:57.660
CHILL WHAT WELL FOR INVOLVEMENT.

02:53:57.727 --> 02:53:59.028
THE SYSTEMS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO

02:53:59.095 --> 02:54:00.863
HOMELESS TO AND BEAR THE BRUNT

02:54:00.930 --> 02:54:02.298
OF HOMELESSNESS MUST BE PART OF

02:54:02.365 --> 02:54:03.232
THE SOLUTION.

02:54:03.299 --> 02:54:05.234
YOU'RE JOINT HEARING TODAY AS

02:54:05.301 --> 02:54:05.802
EVIDENCE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND

02:54:05.868 --> 02:54:06.869
THIS.

02:54:06.936 --> 02:54:08.237
HOW SYSTEMS OUR HOSPITALS ARE

02:54:08.304 --> 02:54:11.040
INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZING THAT

02:54:11.107 --> 02:54:12.775
HOUSING IS HEALTHCARE?

02:54:12.842 --> 02:54:13.643
YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THE KAISER

02:54:13.709 --> 02:54:15.378
PERMANENTE FOR EXAMPLE RECENTLY

02:54:15.444 --> 02:54:16.479
MADE A TWO HUNDRED MILLION

02:54:16.546 --> 02:54:17.647
DOLLAR COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING

02:54:17.713 --> 02:54:18.748
HOMELESSNESS.

02:54:18.815 --> 02:54:20.616
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND MANY

02:54:20.683 --> 02:54:22.618
OTHER HEALTH PROVIDERS AND

02:54:22.685 --> 02:54:23.786
HOSPITAL TO MAKE AN SIMILAR

02:54:23.853 --> 02:54:25.288
EFFORTS INVESTING IN HOUSING AS

02:54:25.354 --> 02:54:27.957
A SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.

02:54:28.024 --> 02:54:29.292
LIKEWISE THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:54:29.358 --> 02:54:31.861
SYSTEM IS INCREASINGLY SEEING

02:54:31.928 --> 02:54:33.563
AND RECOGNIZING THAT AND IMPACT

02:54:33.629 --> 02:54:35.331
IMPORTANT FACTOR IN BREAKING THE

02:54:35.398 --> 02:54:37.066
STREETS TO JAIL CYCLE IS A

02:54:37.133 --> 02:54:38.568
STABLE PLACE TO CALL HOME WHEN

02:54:38.634 --> 02:54:40.102
PEOPLE RE ENTERING THE COMMITTEE

02:54:40.169 --> 02:54:41.737
TO HAVE A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE.

02:54:41.804 --> 02:54:42.905
THEY ARE LESS LIKELY TO GO BACK

02:54:42.972 --> 02:54:45.474
TO JAIL PRISON. ONE SUCCESSFUL

02:54:45.541 --> 02:54:46.943
EFFORT WE'VE BEEN A PART OF IN

02:54:47.009 --> 02:54:48.110
THESE FRANCIS LA'S FLEXIBLE

02:54:48.177 --> 02:54:50.146
HOUSING SUBSIDY POOL AS A FACT

FROM THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES.

02:54:58.588 --> 02:54:59.856
THE POOL HAS BECOME A

02:54:59.922 --> 02:55:01.224
CENTERPIECE OF THE COUNTIES

02:55:01.290 --> 02:55:02.091
EFFORTS TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR

02:55:02.158 --> 02:55:04.360
LET IT LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF

02:55:04.427 --> 02:55:05.695
PEOPLE EVERY YEAR.

02:55:05.761 --> 02:55:06.762
IT STARTED WITH IT PART OF

02:55:06.829 --> 02:55:08.464
HEALTH SERVICES BUT HAS GROWN

AS IT WAS REFERENCED EARLIER THE

02:55:16.239 --> 02:55:18.040
THE REPORT AND EVALUATION BY THE

02:55:18.107 --> 02:55:19.508
RAND CORPORATION.

TWENTY CENTS BY REDUCING HEALTH

02:55:30.052 --> 02:55:31.821
THE SERVICE COSTS SO NOW NOT

02:55:31.888 --> 02:55:33.422
ONLY SUPPORT OF HOUSING.

02:55:36.626 --> 02:55:38.761
COST EFFECTIVE.

02:55:38.828 --> 02:55:39.729
THE THIRD AND FINAL LESSON NOW

02:55:39.795 --> 02:55:40.563
HOW TO HIGHLIGHT AND IT'S BEEN

02:55:40.630 --> 02:55:41.998
REFERENCED ALREADY IS

02:55:42.064 --> 02:55:44.166
COLLABORATION IS KEY. TEN YEARS

02:55:44.233 --> 02:55:46.469
AGO WHEN FOUNDATION STARTED THIS

02:55:46.535 --> 02:55:46.936
CURRENT MISSION OF ON

02:55:47.003 --> 02:55:48.237
HOMELESSNESS WE TALKED WITH

STATE AND FEDERAL LEADERSHIP.

02:55:49.672 --> 02:55:53.209
AND LOS ANGELES WAS SEEN AS IT

02:55:53.276 --> 02:55:54.644
IT NICELY AND I COURTED ORDEN

02:55:54.710 --> 02:55:55.945
COORDINATED MASS AND HOW IT

02:55:56.012 --> 02:55:57.747
ADDRESSED HOMELESSNESS NOT VERY

02:55:57.813 --> 02:55:59.181
MUCH COORDINATION.

02:55:59.248 --> 02:56:00.116
TODAY WE STILL HAVE BIG

02:56:00.182 --> 02:56:01.384
CHALLENGES AS WE'VE DISCUSSED

02:56:01.450 --> 02:56:02.351
BUT WE'RE FORTUNATE TO HAVE

02:56:02.418 --> 02:56:03.920

PARTNERSHIPS THAT SHARE SIMILAR

02:56:05.288 --> 02:56:06.255
VALUES.

02:56:06.322 --> 02:56:07.857
AND A CO INVESTING IN THE SAME

02:56:07.924 --> 02:56:09.859
STRATEGIES AND GOALS. ONE

02:56:09.926 --> 02:56:10.626
IMPORTANT FACTOR GRAY THIS

APARTMENT IS HOME FOR GOOD

02:56:12.261 --> 02:56:13.763
EFFORT WHICH CRISTINA MENTIONED

THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING IS

02:56:55.604 --> 02:56:56.872
IMPORTANT BUT JUST AS IMPORTANT

02:56:56.939 --> 02:56:57.406
AS THE FACT THAT THEY'RE

02:56:57.473 --> 02:56:58.641

NOT USING EVIDENCE BASED

03:00:55.878 --> 03:00:57.279

03:00:57.346 --> 03:00:58.881

03:06:50.065 --> 03:06:51.833
WHOSE NAVIGATING A WORLD BUT

03:06:51.900 --> 03:06:54.069
LARGELY BY THEMSELVES AND HAVING

03:06:54.136 --> 03:06:58.373
DIFFICULTY --

03:06:58.440 --> 03:06:59.274
OBTAINING HOUSING [inaudible]

03:06:59.341 --> 03:07:00.709
AND SO -- I

03:07:00.776 --> 03:07:01.577
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

03:07:01.643 --> 03:07:02.678
MAKE A FEW POINTS FOR YOU THIS

03:07:02.744 --> 03:07:04.313
MORNING BATTING CLEAN UP.

03:07:04.379 --> 03:07:05.647
THE FIRST IS THAT --

03:07:05.714 --> 03:07:07.449
HOMELESSNESS AMONG OUR CLIENTS

03:07:07.516 --> 03:07:09.484
IS IN A MULTI FACETED BUT IT'S

03:07:09.551 --> 03:07:11.520
REALLY DRIVEN BY TWO PRIMARY

03:07:11.587 --> 03:07:12.521
FACTORS.

03:07:12.588 --> 03:07:14.423
AND THAT'S A STAGNATING

03:07:14.489 --> 03:07:16.191
STAGNATING WAGES AND PUBLIC

03:07:16.258 --> 03:07:17.559
ASSISTANCE BENEFITS AND

03:07:17.626 --> 03:07:18.927
SKYROCKETING RENTS.

03:07:18.994 --> 03:07:20.228
THAT'S NOT.

03:07:20.295 --> 03:07:21.964
THAT'S NOT ROCKET SCIENCE BUT WE

03:07:22.030 --> 03:07:24.366
SAW FOR EXAMPLE DURING THE

03:07:24.433 --> 03:07:25.801
RECESSION WHEN.

03:07:25.867 --> 03:07:27.369
CAL ARTS GRANTS WERE CUT IN

03:07:27.436 --> 03:07:29.071
IMMEDIATE SPIKE AND HOMELESSNESS

03:07:29.137 --> 03:07:30.539
AMONG CARRACKS FAMILIES.

03:07:30.606 --> 03:07:31.873
THAT WAS COTERMINOUS ALMOST

03:07:31.940 --> 03:07:33.809
EXACTLY TO THE POINT WHEN THE

03:07:33.875 --> 03:07:35.444
STATE CUT CAL WORKS GRANTS AND

03:07:35.510 --> 03:07:37.579
IMMEDIATELY WE HAD MORE --

03:07:37.646 --> 03:07:38.714
HOMELESS FAMILIES --

03:07:38.780 --> 03:07:43.685
AND SO THE WAGES BENEFITS AND

03:07:43.752 --> 03:07:45.921
RISING RENTS AND HOMELESSNESS --

03:07:45.988 --> 03:07:48.123
IS UNMISTAKABLE.

03:07:48.190 --> 03:07:49.057
SO -- ONE

03:07:49.124 --> 03:07:49.825
MESSAGE I WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE

03:07:49.891 --> 03:07:51.426
WITH YOU TODAY'S ANTI POVERTY

03:07:51.493 --> 03:07:53.495
STRATEGIES ARE HOMELESSNESS

03:07:53.562 --> 03:07:55.230
PREVENTION STRATEGIES.

03:07:55.297 --> 03:07:56.965
AND FROM OUR EXPERIENCE AMONG

03:07:57.032 --> 03:07:57.966
THE MOST IF NOT THE MOST

03:07:58.033 --> 03:07:58.900
IMPORTANT HOMELESSNESS

03:07:58.967 --> 03:08:00.402
PREVENTION STRATEGIES YOU CAN

03:08:00.469 --> 03:08:02.337
ENGAGE IN.

03:08:02.404 --> 03:08:04.373
WE APPRECIATE MORE THAN

03:08:04.439 --> 03:08:06.808
APPRECIATE WE SO --

03:08:06.875 --> 03:08:08.043
ARE GRATEFUL FOR WHAT THE

03:08:08.110 --> 03:08:10.345
LEGISLATURE IN THE PAST GOVERNOR

03:08:10.412 --> 03:08:11.480
IN THE CURRENT GOVERNOR OF DONE

03:08:11.546 --> 03:08:13.915
TO RAISE WELFARE GRANTS SO THAT

03:08:13.982 --> 03:08:15.517
NO CHILD LIVES IN DEEP POVERTY.

03:08:15.584 --> 03:08:17.953
A VAST THE CREATION OF A STATE

03:08:18.020 --> 03:08:19.988
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND AN

03:08:20.055 --> 03:08:22.057
ALMOST DOUBLING OF THAT CREDIT

03:08:22.124 --> 03:08:23.492
IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

03:08:23.558 --> 03:08:25.227
THE INCREASE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE

03:08:25.293 --> 03:08:26.628
THESE ARE ALL CRITICAL

03:08:26.695 --> 03:08:29.498
INITIATIVES --

03:08:29.564 --> 03:08:31.867
TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO TRY TO KEEP

03:08:31.933 --> 03:08:33.669
PACE WITH THEM BE ABLE TO PAY

03:08:33.735 --> 03:08:36.371
FOR RENT RENT AND IN CALIFORNIA.

03:08:36.438 --> 03:08:38.040
AND YET DESPITE THE FACT THAT

03:08:38.106 --> 03:08:40.709
THESE INCREASES ARE HISTORIC --

03:08:40.776 --> 03:08:43.478
BY BY HISTORICAL COMPARISONS WE

03:08:43.545 --> 03:08:44.913
STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO AND

03:08:44.980 --> 03:08:46.682
ONE WAY TO ILLUSTRATE THAT.

03:08:46.748 --> 03:08:48.717
IS TO COMPARE THAT MAXIMUM

03:08:48.784 --> 03:08:50.752
GRANTS AND CAL WORKS TO THE HUD

03:08:50.819 --> 03:08:52.587
FAIR MARKET RENT SO IF YOU LOOK

03:08:52.654 --> 03:08:55.057
AT MAXIMUM GRANT FOR A FAMILY OF

03:08:55.123 --> 03:08:56.425
THREE AND COMPARE IT TO THE HARD

03:08:56.491 --> 03:08:59.227
FAIR MARKET RENT. FOR A TWO

03:08:59.294 --> 03:09:02.197
BEDROOM APARTMENT THE CALYX

03:09:02.264 --> 03:09:04.433
GRANT WOULD PAY 432% OF THAT

03:09:04.499 --> 03:09:05.567
FAIR MARKET RENT.

03:09:05.634 --> 03:09:06.868
NOW YOU ALL MIGHT SAY WELL

03:09:06.935 --> 03:09:08.503
THAT'S SAN FRANCISCO THEY'RE

03:09:08.570 --> 03:09:10.138
THEY'RE NOT AN OUT WIRE.

03:09:10.205 --> 03:09:11.606
IN SAN BERNADINO THE GRANT WOULD

03:09:11.673 --> 03:09:13.041
ON THAT CAL WORKS GRANT WOULD

03:09:13.108 --> 03:09:14.676
ONLY PAY FOR THREE QUARTERS OF

03:09:14.743 --> 03:09:16.111
THE FAIR MARKET RENT.

03:09:16.178 --> 03:09:18.080
IN LA AND SAN DIEGO IT'S A

03:09:18.146 --> 03:09:19.648
LITTLE LESS THAN HALF.

OF THE STATE DON'T ESCAPE THIS

03:09:24.753 --> 03:09:26.054
PHENOMENON AS WELL.

03:09:26.121 --> 03:09:28.857
AND FRESNO MADERA HUMBOLDT --

03:09:28.924 --> 03:09:30.692
THE CAL WORKS GRANT COULD NOT

PAY FOR THE FAIR MARKET RENT IT

03:09:32.294 --> 03:09:35.564
WOULD BE LESS THAN 85%.

03:09:35.630 --> 03:09:37.199
AND SO ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE

03:09:37.265 --> 03:09:38.533
TO THINK ABOUT ANTI POVERTY

03:09:38.600 --> 03:09:39.701
STRATEGIES AS HOMELESSNESS

03:09:39.768 --> 03:09:41.670
STRATEGIES --

03:09:41.737 --> 03:09:42.938
I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE

03:09:43.004 --> 03:09:44.439

ON THE IMPORTANCE OF IN BETTING

03:09:47.809 --> 03:09:49.177

03:10:29.551 --> 03:10:31.887
IN PART BECAUSE WE HAVE ACCESS

THE STATE --

03:10:35.557 --> 03:10:37.159
BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE THESE

03:10:37.225 --> 03:10:39.194
PROGRAMS HAVE CASE MANAGEMENT

03:10:39.261 --> 03:10:40.428

AND I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU AN

03:10:42.097 --> 03:10:43.365

CHILDREN WHO ARE GOING TO SCHOOL

03:10:51.740 --> 03:10:52.974
EVERY DAY --

03:10:53.041 --> 03:10:54.309
SHE WAS ESCAPING DOMESTIC

03:10:54.376 --> 03:10:57.145
VIOLENCE AND SHE WAS ON THE RUN --

03:10:57.212 --> 03:10:58.847
SHE FOUND THE COUNTY HUMAN

03:10:58.914 --> 03:11:01.149

CONNECTED HER WITH THE DOMESTIC

03:11:04.553 --> 03:11:06.354
VIOLENCE PROGRAM TO PROTECT HER

03:11:06.421 --> 03:11:08.023
FROM HER ABUSER THEY CONNECTED

03:11:08.089 --> 03:11:09.891
HER WITH MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT.

03:11:09.958 --> 03:11:11.126
TO TO DEAL WITH THE TRAUMA OF

03:11:11.193 --> 03:11:13.195
HER ABUSE THEY CONNECTED HER

03:11:13.261 --> 03:11:15.630
WITH CHILD CARE AND EMPLOYMENT --

03:11:15.697 --> 03:11:17.666

A PLACE TO LIVE.

03:11:20.836 --> 03:11:21.970
AND IT WAS INHIBITING HER

03:11:22.037 --> 03:11:23.638
ABILITY TO TO COMPLETE HER

03:11:23.705 --> 03:11:24.940
SUCCESS.

03:11:25.006 --> 03:11:26.241
ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME THAT SHE

03:11:26.308 --> 03:11:26.975
WAS GOING THROUGH THIS

03:11:27.042 --> 03:11:28.910
EXPERIENCE THE STATE LAUNCHED A

03:11:28.977 --> 03:11:30.245
HOUSING SUPPORT PROGRAM.

03:11:30.312 --> 03:11:32.280
AND IT WAS THE FINAL PIECE OF

03:11:32.347 --> 03:11:36.284
SERVICES THAT ALLOWED HER. TO TO

03:11:36.351 --> 03:11:37.085
LEAVE THE ROLES AND SHE'S NOW

03:11:37.152 --> 03:11:39.287
GAINFULLY EMPLOYED AND OFF THE

03:11:39.354 --> 03:11:40.989
THE HUMAN SERVICES ROLES.

03:11:41.056 --> 03:11:42.691
THE OTHER THING THAT'S HAPPENED

03:11:42.757 --> 03:11:43.458
IN THE CREATION OF THESE

03:11:43.525 --> 03:11:45.060
PROGRAMS IS IT IT'S BROUGHT THE

03:11:45.126 --> 03:11:47.529
HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES INTO

03:11:47.596 --> 03:11:48.897
LOCAL HOMELESSNESS NETWORKS.

03:11:48.964 --> 03:11:50.465
MY LAST BOARD MEETING I ASKED MY

03:11:50.532 --> 03:11:52.033
MEMBERS HOW MANY OF YOU ARE

03:11:52.100 --> 03:11:53.668
MEANING FULLY ENGAGED IN YOUR

03:11:53.735 --> 03:11:55.136
LOCAL CONTINUE OF CARE.

03:11:55.203 --> 03:11:56.838
IT WAS ALMOST ALL OF THEM.

03:11:56.905 --> 03:11:58.039
IF I ASKED THAT QUESTION TEN

03:11:58.106 --> 03:12:00.542
YEARS AGO WOULD BE.

03:12:00.609 --> 03:12:02.277
TO SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES

03:12:02.344 --> 03:12:04.079
AND SO THE WORLD ARE COMING

03:12:04.145 --> 03:12:06.214
TOGETHER AND AND GOOD THINGS ARE

03:12:06.281 --> 03:12:08.283
HAPPENING BECAUSE THOSE WORLDS

03:12:08.350 --> 03:12:09.417
ARE COMING TOGETHER.

03:12:09.484 --> 03:12:12.520
THE NUMBER ONE BARRIER WE FACE --

03:12:12.587 --> 03:12:13.922
BY COULD ANSWER THE QUESTION YOU

03:12:13.989 --> 03:12:15.757
ASKED A PRIOR WITNESS CHAIRMAN

03:12:15.824 --> 03:12:17.659
CHIU IS A LACK OF AFFORDABLE

03:12:17.726 --> 03:12:19.094
HOUSING SUPPLY.

03:12:19.160 --> 03:12:21.496
SERVICES ARE ALL CRITICAL BUT

03:12:21.563 --> 03:12:23.298
WHAT WE'RE BUMPING UP AGAINST IS

03:12:23.365 --> 03:12:25.533
IS BEING ABLE TO FIND --

03:12:25.600 --> 03:12:26.201
LANDLORDS --

03:12:26.268 --> 03:12:29.037
THAT WILL RENT A DECENT PLACE A

03:12:29.104 --> 03:12:30.839
PRICE THAT OUR CLIENTS CAN

03:12:30.906 --> 03:12:32.307
AFFORD.

03:12:32.374 --> 03:12:34.976
AND AS WE THINK ABOUT THE ARRAY

03:12:35.043 --> 03:12:35.911
I'M TELLING YOU FROM THE

03:12:35.977 --> 03:12:37.345
STANDPOINT OF THE HUMAN SERVICES

03:12:37.412 --> 03:12:39.781
AGENCIES WE ARE BUMPING UP

03:12:39.848 --> 03:12:41.549
AGAINST THE SUPPLY PROBLEM AS

03:12:41.616 --> 03:12:43.785
THE KEY BARRIER. TO BEING ABLE

03:12:43.852 --> 03:12:45.453
TO EXPAND THE SUCCESS OF THESE

03:12:45.520 --> 03:12:46.855
PROGRAMS SO QUICKLY GOING.

03:12:46.922 --> 03:12:49.224
INTO SOME AREAS OF OF SOLUTIONS

03:12:49.291 --> 03:12:50.625
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

03:12:50.692 --> 03:12:52.394
CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE ANTI

03:12:52.460 --> 03:12:53.728
POVERTY PROGRAMS.

03:12:53.795 --> 03:12:55.797
EXPANSIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA

03:12:55.864 --> 03:12:57.732
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT --

03:12:57.799 --> 03:13:00.468
MAKE SURE WE ADD COST OF LIVING

03:13:00.535 --> 03:13:02.637
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CALYX PROGRAM

03:13:02.704 --> 03:13:04.339
IN THE E. I. T. C. INTO AS A

03:13:04.406 --> 03:13:05.140
SIZES BE.

03:13:05.206 --> 03:13:07.309
SO THOSE PROGRAMS DON'T LOSE

03:13:07.375 --> 03:13:09.444
PACE --

03:13:09.511 --> 03:13:10.745
AGAINST INFLATION.

03:13:10.812 --> 03:13:11.880
I THINK WE NEED TO MAINS

03:13:11.947 --> 03:13:14.683
MAINTAIN SUPPORT EVALUATE IN THE

03:13:14.749 --> 03:13:16.017
WAY THAT MY COLLEAGUE --

03:13:16.084 --> 03:13:18.353
MISS SUDDEN TALKED ABOUT THESE

03:13:18.420 --> 03:13:20.388
HUMAN SERVICES SPECIFIC

03:13:20.455 --> 03:13:22.457
HOMELESSNESS INTERVENTIONS --

03:13:22.524 --> 03:13:24.693
AND BRING THEM TO SCALE --

03:13:24.759 --> 03:13:26.494
THERE THEY DO NOT SERVE THE

03:13:26.561 --> 03:13:28.263
ENTIRE POTENTIAL POPULATION THE

03:13:28.330 --> 03:13:29.731
BRINGING FAMILIES HOME PROGRAM

03:13:29.798 --> 03:13:31.599
IS THE PROGRAM FOR FAMILIES WITH

03:13:31.666 --> 03:13:32.167
CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE

03:13:32.233 --> 03:13:34.469
SYSTEM. TWELVE COUNTIES GOT

03:13:34.536 --> 03:13:36.771
FUNDED --

03:13:36.838 --> 03:13:38.340
OUT OF TWENTY THREE THAT APPLIED --

03:13:38.406 --> 03:13:40.608
THAT PROGRAM IS ABOUT TO EXPIRE

03:13:40.675 --> 03:13:41.977
AND COUNTIES ARE ABOUT TO START

03:13:42.043 --> 03:13:43.878
CLOSING DOWN INTAKE AND SO WILL

03:13:43.945 --> 03:13:45.547
ASK THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR IN

03:13:45.613 --> 03:13:46.848
THE BUDGET PROCESS TO RE

03:13:46.915 --> 03:13:48.950
AUTHORIZE --

03:13:49.017 --> 03:13:49.517
THAT BRINGING FAMILIES HOME

03:13:49.584 --> 03:13:52.988
PROGRAM I WOULD LIKE TO TO

03:13:53.054 --> 03:13:54.823
CONCUR WITH MS REPORT I THINK

03:13:54.889 --> 03:13:56.424
THE STATE HAS TO INVEST IN LONG

03:13:56.491 --> 03:13:57.826
TERM RENTAL SUBSIDIES.

03:13:57.892 --> 03:13:59.995
WE HAVE MANY CLIENTS THAT WE

03:14:00.061 --> 03:14:03.298
HELP WHOSE WHOSE ONLY BARRIER.

03:14:03.365 --> 03:14:05.467
TO STAYING HOUSED IS THE GAP

03:14:05.533 --> 03:14:07.135
BETWEEN WHAT THEY MAKE.

03:14:07.202 --> 03:14:08.837
AND HOW MUCH IT COSTS TO LIVE.

03:14:08.903 --> 03:14:10.505
AND WHAT THEY MAKE IS THE MOST

03:14:10.572 --> 03:14:11.673
THAT THEY CAN THEY'RE DOING

03:14:11.740 --> 03:14:13.141
EVERYTHING THEY CAN ARE

03:14:13.208 --> 03:14:14.943
GAINFULLY EMPLOYED --

03:14:15.010 --> 03:14:17.846
AND SO IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE FOR

03:14:17.912 --> 03:14:21.182
US -- TO

03:14:21.249 --> 03:14:22.617
FIGURE HOW WE COULD STEM THE

03:14:22.684 --> 03:14:23.651
TIDE.

03:14:23.718 --> 03:14:25.820
AGAINST HOMELESSNESS UNTIL WE

03:14:25.887 --> 03:14:27.288
CAN DEAL WITH THE SUPPLY ISSUE

03:14:27.355 --> 03:14:30.058
WITHOUT CREATING EXPANDED --

03:14:30.125 --> 03:14:31.960
RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS.

03:14:32.027 --> 03:14:33.728
AND I THINK.

03:14:33.795 --> 03:14:36.431
ONCE WE DO THAT.

03:14:36.498 --> 03:14:37.399
WE ALSO HAVE TO ADDRESS

03:14:37.465 --> 03:14:40.502
DISCRIMINATION ON THE COUNTY

03:14:40.568 --> 03:14:42.470
HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES EVERYDAY

03:14:42.537 --> 03:14:44.072
EXPERIENCE THE DIFFICULTY

03:14:44.139 --> 03:14:46.408
FINDING LANDLORDS WHO MAY HAVE A

03:14:46.474 --> 03:14:48.009
UNIT BUT ARE UNWILLING TO RENT

03:14:48.076 --> 03:14:49.577
TO OUR CLIENTS WHETHER IT'S

03:14:49.644 --> 03:14:50.512
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SECTION

03:14:50.578 --> 03:14:51.212
EIGHT VOUCHER.

03:14:51.279 --> 03:14:52.147
WHETHER IT'S BECAUSE THEIR

03:14:52.213 --> 03:14:53.915
FORMER FOSTER YOUTH WHETHER IT'S

03:14:53.982 --> 03:14:55.050
BECAUSE THEIR SUBSIDY IN SOME

03:14:55.116 --> 03:14:56.618
WAY COMES FROM GOVERNMENT.

03:14:56.684 --> 03:14:58.787
AND SO WE WOULD CONCUR WITH THAT

03:14:58.853 --> 03:15:00.955
PRIOR WITNESSES --

03:15:01.022 --> 03:15:03.792
THAT RECOMMENDED ADDING SOURCE

03:15:03.858 --> 03:15:05.160
OF INCOME --

03:15:05.226 --> 03:15:08.430
TO THE TENANT PROTECTIONS --

03:15:08.496 --> 03:15:10.398
AND FINALLY I THINK WE NEED TO

03:15:10.465 --> 03:15:11.966
SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME

03:15:12.033 --> 03:15:12.834
FOCUSING ON THE NEEDS OF

03:15:12.901 --> 03:15:14.869
TRANSITION H. FOSTER YOUTH WHO

03:15:14.936 --> 03:15:16.404
ARE NAVIGATING THIS WORLD.

03:15:16.471 --> 03:15:18.106
AND MANY CASES WITH VERY LITTLE

03:15:18.173 --> 03:15:20.575
SUPPORT SOMETIMES WITH SUBSIDIES

03:15:20.642 --> 03:15:22.544
BUT NOT THE HELP NAVIGATING A

03:15:22.610 --> 03:15:23.912
SYSTEM THAT IS INCREDIBLY

03:15:23.978 --> 03:15:25.113
DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE WITH

03:15:25.180 --> 03:15:26.781
RESOURCES NEVER MIND PEOPLE.

03:15:26.848 --> 03:15:27.882
WHO'VE GROWN UP --

03:15:27.949 --> 03:15:29.551
WITHOUT THAT PARENTAL SUPPORT

03:15:29.617 --> 03:15:31.152
THANK YOU.

03:15:31.219 --> 03:15:32.487
I THANK YOU LET'S SAID BRING IT

03:15:32.554 --> 03:15:34.589
TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS --

03:15:34.656 --> 03:15:36.391
I'LL KICK IT OFF WITH ONE

03:15:36.458 --> 03:15:37.659
QUESTION TO MISTER MECCA --

03:15:37.725 --> 03:15:38.827
I WAS VERY STRUCK BY YOUR

03:15:38.893 --> 03:15:40.495
COMMENT ABOUT THE LINK BETWEEN A

03:15:40.562 --> 03:15:41.896
DROP AND CAL WORKS.

03:15:41.963 --> 03:15:43.164
ASSISTANCE AND AND HOMELESSNESS

03:15:43.231 --> 03:15:46.668
AND IT I WANT TO JUST PUBLICLY

03:15:46.734 --> 03:15:48.036

STAFF AS WELL AS THOSE OF YOU

03:15:50.105 --> 03:15:50.939
WHO WORK ON THESE ISSUES WHICH

03:15:51.005 --> 03:15:52.907
IS OFTENTIMES OF ANTI POVERTY

03:15:52.974 --> 03:15:54.409
STRATEGIES WE INTUITIVELY KNOW

03:15:54.476 --> 03:15:56.611
THE IMPACT ON HOMELESSNESS.

03:15:56.678 --> 03:15:58.079
ART BUT THE DEBATE WE HAVE HERE

03:15:58.146 --> 03:15:59.614
IN THE LEGISLATURE IS USUALLY A

03:15:59.681 --> 03:16:01.082
FUNCTION OF HOW MUCH BUDGET WE

03:16:01.149 --> 03:16:02.083
HAVE.

03:16:02.150 --> 03:16:03.151
AND HOW GENEROUS WERE FEELING IN

03:16:03.218 --> 03:16:04.686
ANY PARTICULAR YEAR RATHER THAN

03:16:04.752 --> 03:16:07.122
FOCUSING ON WHAT THE IMPACT OF A

03:16:07.188 --> 03:16:08.923
DOLLAR NOT SPENT IN AN AREA IS

03:16:08.990 --> 03:16:11.493
GOING TO HAVE IN OTHER AREAS SO --

03:16:11.559 --> 03:16:13.194
WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE MISS REPORT

03:16:13.261 --> 03:16:15.096
A FEW YEARS AGO HAD ASKED MY

03:16:15.163 --> 03:16:17.098
OFFICE TO INTRODUCE A BILL.

03:16:17.165 --> 03:16:17.999
THAT HAS BECOME THE HOUSING FOR

03:16:18.066 --> 03:16:19.434
HEALTHY CALIFORNIA PROGRAM WHICH

03:16:19.501 --> 03:16:21.302
ADDRESSES THE REALITY THAT IF

03:16:21.369 --> 03:16:22.537
YOU'RE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS ON

03:16:22.604 --> 03:16:23.671
THE STREETS.

03:16:23.738 --> 03:16:24.839
YOUR HEALTH CARE COST YOUR

03:16:24.906 --> 03:16:27.442
IMPACT ON THE EMERGENCY ROOMS ON

03:16:27.509 --> 03:16:29.477
IT JAIL HEALTH SERVICES AND

03:16:29.544 --> 03:16:31.079
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES LET'S SAY

03:16:31.146 --> 03:16:32.413
IT'S SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A

03:16:32.480 --> 03:16:33.715
YEAR FOR A CHRONICALLY HOMELESS

03:16:33.781 --> 03:16:35.183
PERSON.

03:16:35.250 --> 03:16:37.118
AND IT ONLY COST US SAY NINETEEN

03:16:37.185 --> 03:16:37.785
THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR TO PUT A

03:16:37.852 --> 03:16:38.753
SUPPORT OF HOUSING ROOF OVER

03:16:38.820 --> 03:16:41.756
THEIR HEADS. TO AVOID SIXTY

03:16:41.823 --> 03:16:43.191
THOUSAND DOLLARS OF COSTS WHAT I

03:16:43.258 --> 03:16:46.060
HAVE WONDERED IS FOR MANY OF THE

03:16:46.127 --> 03:16:47.362
SOCIAL SERVICE SAFETY NET

03:16:47.428 --> 03:16:49.497
PROGRAMS THAT ARE WITHIN.

03:16:49.564 --> 03:16:51.366
MEN OF CHAIRS COMMITTEE THAT SHE

03:16:51.432 --> 03:16:54.335
IS FIGHTING.

03:16:54.402 --> 03:16:56.237
FOR HOW CAN WE PUT THE

03:16:56.304 --> 03:16:57.805
INTERSECTION ALLEY TOGETHER HOW

03:16:57.872 --> 03:16:59.541
DO WE PULL THAT DATA OUT SO THAT

03:16:59.607 --> 03:17:01.743
WE KNOW THAT IF WE WERE TO

03:17:01.809 --> 03:17:02.644
INCREASE FUNDING TO THEIR FOR TO

03:17:02.710 --> 03:17:03.945
THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT

03:17:04.012 --> 03:17:05.246
THAT COULD HELP US.

03:17:05.313 --> 03:17:06.614
SAVE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

03:17:06.681 --> 03:17:07.982
DOLLARS OF EXPENSES WHEN IT

03:17:08.049 --> 03:17:09.884
COMES TO HOMELESSNESS SO I WANT

03:17:09.951 --> 03:17:11.352
TO SORT OF PUT THAT OUT AS A AS

03:17:11.419 --> 03:17:12.754
A CONCEPT AS A POTENTIALLY

03:17:12.820 --> 03:17:14.122
CHALLENGE FOR FOR STAFF AND

03:17:14.189 --> 03:17:15.757
ADVOCATES TO THINK ABOUT.

03:17:15.823 --> 03:17:17.091
BUT WOULD LOVE TO TO CONTINUE

03:17:17.158 --> 03:17:19.494
THE CONVERSATION OF HOW WE HOW

03:17:19.561 --> 03:17:20.862
WE SHOW.

03:17:20.929 --> 03:17:21.963
ALL OF THOSE LINKS AND AND MAKE

03:17:22.030 --> 03:17:24.599
SURE THAT WE ARE SPEND AS AS AS

03:17:24.666 --> 03:17:26.334
WELL AS WE CAN AS EFFICIENTLY AS

03:17:26.401 --> 03:17:28.336
WE CAN AS WELLS AS HUMANELY AS

03:17:28.403 --> 03:17:29.637
WE CAN.

03:17:29.704 --> 03:17:32.240
WITHOUT I KNOW --

03:17:32.307 --> 03:17:34.742
MS QUIRK SILVA HAS SOME COMMENTS --

03:17:34.809 --> 03:17:38.713
ON THE HOUSING THAT MODEL WHERE

03:17:38.780 --> 03:17:40.481
YOU MAY BRING AND HEALTH CARE

03:17:40.548 --> 03:17:42.483
PROVIDERS AND MENTAL HEALTH

03:17:42.550 --> 03:17:43.551
PROVIDERS.

03:17:43.618 --> 03:17:45.954
I KNOW ORANGE COUNTY IS LOOKING

03:17:46.020 --> 03:17:48.723
TOWARDS A MODEL --

03:17:48.790 --> 03:17:50.158
TO BUILD A MENTAL HEALTH

03:17:50.225 --> 03:17:52.794
FACILITY BUT ACTUALLY HAVE SOME

03:17:52.860 --> 03:17:54.963
KAISER AND CAL OPTIMA PUT N

03:17:55.029 --> 03:17:57.265
SOME DOLLARS I THINK THAT.

03:17:57.332 --> 03:17:59.334
ACTUALLY COMES OUT OF THE

03:17:59.400 --> 03:18:01.135
EXPERIENCE THAT THEY ARE --

03:18:01.202 --> 03:18:03.171
RECEIVING SO MANY CHRONICALLY

03:18:03.238 --> 03:18:04.639
ILL PATIENTS COMING INTO THEIR

03:18:04.706 --> 03:18:06.040
EMERGENCY ROOMS THAT THEY'RE

03:18:06.107 --> 03:18:09.277
REALIZING THAT THIS IN FACT IS A

03:18:09.344 --> 03:18:11.946
MODEL THAT IF SUPPORTED WOULD

03:18:12.013 --> 03:18:13.681
GIVE THEM SOME RELIEF AT THE

03:18:13.748 --> 03:18:15.383
HOSPITALS --

03:18:15.450 --> 03:18:16.918
BUT THAT BEING SAID I WANTED TO

03:18:16.985 --> 03:18:18.953
ASK IN AGAIN WHOEVER CAN ANSWER

03:18:19.020 --> 03:18:20.421
THIS ON THE SECTION EIGHT

03:18:20.488 --> 03:18:24.259
HOUSING WHICH I KNOW IS A DONE

03:18:24.325 --> 03:18:25.460
THROUGH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

03:18:25.526 --> 03:18:27.161
I KNOW THAT THERE WAS.

03:18:27.228 --> 03:18:30.798
A PROPOSAL TO REDUCE THE SECTION

03:18:30.865 --> 03:18:33.434
EIGHT HOUSING --

03:18:33.501 --> 03:18:36.904
ALLOTMENT OR TO THAT END HAS

03:18:36.971 --> 03:18:38.973
THAT ACTUALLY OCCURRED AND WHAT

03:18:39.040 --> 03:18:41.376
IS THAT LOOK LIKE FOR THE PEOPLE

03:18:41.442 --> 03:18:46.080
WHO ARE RECEIVING A TAKE A STAB

03:18:46.147 --> 03:18:46.748
AT THAT --

03:18:46.814 --> 03:18:49.617
SO THAT HAS BEEN A A TRUMP

03:18:49.684 --> 03:18:51.519
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL --

03:18:51.586 --> 03:18:53.588
IT IS NOT YET PASSED --

03:18:53.655 --> 03:18:55.290
AND THERE ARE SOME OF THE

03:18:55.356 --> 03:18:57.091
DISCUSSIONS AROUND WHETHER WORK

03:18:57.158 --> 03:18:58.860
REQUIREMENT SHOULD BE REQUIRED

03:18:58.926 --> 03:19:00.094
SHOULD BE ADDED TO RECEIVE

03:19:00.161 --> 03:19:01.696
SECTION EIGHT SO THOSE TWO

03:19:01.763 --> 03:19:02.864
THINGS WOULD.

03:19:02.930 --> 03:19:04.766
SIGNIFICANTLY --

03:19:04.832 --> 03:19:07.402
THIS PLACE WE THINK A NUMBER OF

03:19:07.468 --> 03:19:09.170
PEOPLE WHO ARE RECEIVING VALUE

03:19:09.237 --> 03:19:10.972
NOW.

03:19:11.039 --> 03:19:11.706
SO IN CALIFORNIA IS THERE

03:19:11.773 --> 03:19:13.541
ANYTHING THAT WE COULD DO ABOUT

03:19:13.608 --> 03:19:21.582
THEM.

03:19:21.649 --> 03:19:22.483
I MEAN YOU COULD CERTAINLY AND

03:19:22.550 --> 03:19:24.652
WE WOULD RECOMMEND SEPARATE AND

03:19:24.719 --> 03:19:25.186
APART FROM WHAT THE TRUMP

03:19:25.253 --> 03:19:28.256
ADMINISTRATION TO CREATE --%

03:19:28.323 --> 03:19:30.024
STATE FUNDED OPPORTUNITIES FOR

03:19:30.091 --> 03:19:31.092
RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND THEN YOU

03:19:31.159 --> 03:19:32.627
IT WOULD BE UP TO YOU TO BE ABLE

03:19:32.694 --> 03:19:33.895
TO SET WITH THOSE.

03:19:33.961 --> 03:19:35.063
BUT THE GENEROSITY OF THAT

03:19:35.129 --> 03:19:37.332
SUPPORT IS.

03:19:37.398 --> 03:19:39.801
AND THEN ONE ONE LAST QUESTION

03:19:39.867 --> 03:19:42.904
ON THE MODEL WHERE WE ARE

03:19:42.970 --> 03:19:45.473
LOOKING AT NOW OF COURSE HOUSING

03:19:45.540 --> 03:19:46.607
FIRST.

03:19:46.674 --> 03:19:48.609
WITH SUPPORT FROM EMERGENCY

03:19:48.676 --> 03:19:50.144
HOUSING.

03:19:50.211 --> 03:19:52.847
RAPID RESPONSE IN OTHER WAYS TO

03:19:52.914 --> 03:19:54.048
SUPPORT PEOPLE ARE HOMELESS

03:19:54.115 --> 03:19:55.783
VOUCHERS THINGS LIKE THAT WE

03:19:55.850 --> 03:19:58.219
HAVEN'T HEARD A LOT ABOUT MENTAL

03:19:58.286 --> 03:20:00.455
HEALTH IN THE SENSE THAT AN

03:20:00.521 --> 03:20:03.558
INDIVIDUAL WOULD NOT BE ABLE --

03:20:03.624 --> 03:20:05.526
TO MANAGE ON THEIR OWN WITHOUT

03:20:05.593 --> 03:20:06.861
HOUSING FIRST.

03:20:06.928 --> 03:20:09.063
EMERGENCY SHELTER THEY ALSO WILL

03:20:09.130 --> 03:20:11.065
NOT DO WELL --

03:20:11.132 --> 03:20:14.502
ARE WE LOOKING AT ANY I AS FAR

03:20:14.569 --> 03:20:17.638
IS UP A MENTAL HEALTH --

03:20:17.705 --> 03:20:19.507
SOME TYPE OF HOUSING I KNOW WE

03:20:19.574 --> 03:20:22.110
WENT THROUGH THIS DECADES AGO

03:20:22.176 --> 03:20:24.679
BUT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE --

03:20:24.746 --> 03:20:26.781
INDIVIDUALS WHERE THE EMERGENCY

03:20:26.848 --> 03:20:28.683
MODEL AND AT THE HOUSING ENOUGH

03:20:28.750 --> 03:20:32.253
ALONE DOES NOT WORK ARE THERE

03:20:32.320 --> 03:20:35.390
ANY MODELS OUT THERE. TO ME I

03:20:35.456 --> 03:20:36.891
THINK THE THE MODEL OF SUPPORT

03:20:36.958 --> 03:20:38.025
OF HOUSING --

03:20:38.092 --> 03:20:40.027
IT IS JUST THAT WHERE EVEN IF

03:20:40.094 --> 03:20:41.596
IT'S HOUSING FIRST YOU ALLOW

03:20:41.662 --> 03:20:43.731
PEOPLE TO BECOME STABILIZED --

03:20:43.798 --> 03:20:45.633
AND AND MAKE THOSE SERVICES

03:20:45.700 --> 03:20:46.501
AVAILABLE THAT'S WITH A

03:20:46.567 --> 03:20:47.635
PARTNERSHIP --

03:20:47.702 --> 03:20:48.770
FOR EXAMPLE IN LA AND OTHER

03:20:48.836 --> 03:20:50.371
PLACES WHERE YOU HAVE THE HEALTH

03:20:50.438 --> 03:20:51.606
DEPARTMENT AND THE MOUNT TELL

03:20:51.672 --> 03:20:52.740

03:20:52.807 --> 03:20:53.508
THEY'RE WORKING TOGETHER

03:20:53.574 --> 03:20:55.009
PROVIDING THE SERVICES FOR

03:20:55.076 --> 03:20:55.977
PEOPLE WHO NEED THAT WE WE

03:20:56.043 --> 03:20:57.879
CERTAINLY AND I'VE MET LOTS OF

03:20:57.945 --> 03:20:59.447
THESE PEOPLE WHO.

03:20:59.514 --> 03:21:01.182
STRUGGLED FOR YEARS ON THE

03:21:01.249 --> 03:21:02.049
STREETS --

03:21:02.116 --> 03:21:04.118
DUE TO MASS HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE

03:21:04.185 --> 03:21:05.553
USE DISORDER --

03:21:05.620 --> 03:21:07.188

THAT S..

03:21:18.666 --> 03:21:20.001
AND NO PLACE LIKE HOME IF I

03:21:20.067 --> 03:21:21.302
COULD JUST MENTION --

03:21:21.369 --> 03:21:22.336
NO PLACE LIKE HOME IS

03:21:22.403 --> 03:21:24.539
PROPOSITION TWO THAT WAS JUST

03:21:24.605 --> 03:21:26.174
RECENTLY PASSED BY VOTERS.

03:21:26.240 --> 03:21:27.708
WILL CREATE --

03:21:27.775 --> 03:21:30.178
REVENUE BOND TO BOND AGAINST

03:21:30.244 --> 03:21:31.679

PROVIDE SERVICES IN HOUSING FOR

03:21:39.620 --> 03:21:41.722
THOSE FOR THAT POPULATION.

03:21:41.789 --> 03:21:43.090
IN IF I MIGHT.

03:21:43.157 --> 03:21:44.559
ALSO TO MR CHOOSE POINT --

03:21:44.625 --> 03:21:46.961
THE STATE CREATED A MEDICAID --

03:21:47.028 --> 03:21:48.496
SADDAM MEDICAID WAIVER FOR THE

03:21:48.563 --> 03:21:49.630
WHOLE PERSON CARE.

03:21:49.697 --> 03:21:52.166
PILOT PROGRAM TO TRY TO GET OUT

03:21:52.233 --> 03:21:54.368
THE USE OF MEDICAID DOLLARS --

03:21:54.435 --> 03:21:55.336
TO HELP HOMELESS PEOPLE

03:21:55.403 --> 03:21:57.138
ACKNOWLEDGING THE IDEA THAT

03:21:57.205 --> 03:21:58.339
WE'RE SPENDING A LOT MORE MONEY

03:21:58.406 --> 03:22:00.241
EARNED MONEY IN OTHER SYSTEMS.

03:22:00.308 --> 03:22:04.612
BECAUSE THERE'S NO HOUSING THE

03:22:04.679 --> 03:22:05.847
ONE THAT WAIVER THAT WE WERE

03:22:05.913 --> 03:22:07.248
GRANTED BY THE FEDERAL

03:22:07.315 --> 03:22:09.917
GOVERNMENT WAS THAT WE COULD NOT

03:22:09.984 --> 03:22:11.786
PAY FOR THE HOUSING --

03:22:11.853 --> 03:22:13.988
WITH THE MEDICAID DOLLARS AND SO

03:22:14.055 --> 03:22:15.389
THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY PROPOSAL.

03:22:15.456 --> 03:22:16.757

CARE PILOT AND I THINK THERE ARE

03:22:23.064 --> 03:22:24.665
SOME OPPORTUNITIES TO LOOK AT

03:22:24.732 --> 03:22:26.367
HOW THAT HOW THOSE PILOTS WILL

03:22:26.434 --> 03:22:28.369
WORK WHEN WE CAN ACTUALLY

03:22:28.436 --> 03:22:30.104
SUPPORT THE HOUSING AS WELL AS

03:22:30.171 --> 03:22:31.239
THE OTHER.

03:22:31.305 --> 03:22:36.410
SUPPORT OF SERVICES [inaudible]

03:22:36.477 --> 03:22:39.280
I'M SURE.

03:22:39.347 --> 03:22:40.882
WHEN WE THINK OF CREATIVE WAYS

03:22:40.948 --> 03:22:44.719
OF SOLVING SOME OF OUR ISSUES --

03:22:44.785 --> 03:22:46.187
THAT'S WHAT WANT ONE OF THOSE

03:22:46.254 --> 03:22:47.989
SUGGESTIONS THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME

03:22:48.055 --> 03:22:50.358
DURING OUR DREAM BIG I. E. WE

03:22:50.424 --> 03:22:52.059
HAVE OUR MILLENNIALS TALK ABOUT

03:22:52.126 --> 03:22:53.561
SOLUTIONS.

03:22:53.628 --> 03:22:55.263
THE TALK ABOUT THE BIG PROBLEMS

03:22:55.329 --> 03:22:57.498
AND THEN THEY DON'T HAVE THE THE

03:22:57.565 --> 03:22:58.633
BARRIERS THAT WE ALL HAVE

03:22:58.699 --> 03:23:00.001
BECAUSE SO WE'VE ALREADY TRIED

03:23:00.067 --> 03:23:01.335
THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY

03:23:01.402 --> 03:23:02.737
WITHIN THEMBI'S WE THINK OF

03:23:02.803 --> 03:23:04.338
EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG.

03:23:04.405 --> 03:23:06.474
BUT THE MULLIN MEALS ARE YOU'D

03:23:06.541 --> 03:23:07.942
GET TOGETHER AND THEY SAID THEY

03:23:08.009 --> 03:23:09.844
LOOK AT THESE BIG SOLUTIONS AND

03:23:09.911 --> 03:23:11.279
THEY HAVE NO BARRIERS ARE SAY IN

03:23:11.345 --> 03:23:12.813
ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS.

03:23:12.880 --> 03:23:15.416
THAT THEY HAD TO HOMELESSNESS --

03:23:15.483 --> 03:23:17.451
SAID LET'S DO WHAT AND I BELIEVE

03:23:17.518 --> 03:23:18.786
IT'S HAWAII DOES.

03:23:18.853 --> 03:23:22.456
WITH A DOCTOR CAN PRESCRIBE.

03:23:22.523 --> 03:23:23.491
HOUSING.

03:23:23.558 --> 03:23:24.959
AS PART OF THE TREATMENT FOR

03:23:25.026 --> 03:23:26.494
THAT PERSON.

03:23:26.561 --> 03:23:28.062
AND SO WHAT WOULD WE LOOK AT

03:23:28.129 --> 03:23:29.897
CREATIVE SOLUTIONS LIKE THAT WE

03:23:29.964 --> 03:23:31.299
KNOW THAT THERE'S A THERE ARE

03:23:31.365 --> 03:23:33.467
OTHER BARRIERS RELATED TO THAT.

03:23:33.534 --> 03:23:35.536
BUT I THINK THAT BEING CREATIVE

03:23:35.603 --> 03:23:37.204
I THINK IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT

03:23:37.271 --> 03:23:38.539

03:23:38.606 --> 03:23:40.808

WAS REALLY STRUCK BY THE COMMENT
