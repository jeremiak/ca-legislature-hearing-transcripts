ACTIVITIES AND THAT OUR USINESS TYPE ACTIVITIES IS NOW NEGATIVE SIXTEEN BILLION SO COMBINED. FOR TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS -- IN DEFICIT SO I'VE BEEN VOTING NO WHERE I'M STANDING ON A LOT OF SPENDING OPPORTUNITIES. AND AND SO SOME PEOPLE LOOK AT THE GLASS IS HALF FULL AND I'M KIND OF LOOKING AT IT IS HALF EMPTY SO THAT. THAT WILL MAYBE EXPLAIN MY KASHA A LOT OF THESE. SPENDING BOTH SO WE'VE MADE TONIGHT I JUST WANTED. TO BUT THAT ON THE RECORD WE APPRECIATE YOUR CLARIFICATION. THE MOTION -- IS ESTATE IT. ASSEMBLY VOTE OF FIVE ZERO SENATE VOTE OF THREE TO TWO MOVING. TO EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT ISSUE TWENTY PAID FAMILY LEAVE -- THERE IS A COMPROMISE WITH MODIFICATIONS THE BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE IN TBL YES.

WE A ROBUST DISCUSSION AS YOU RECALL ON THIS ITEM I DO AND THE EXACT COSTSTHAT. WOULD BE BORNE BY THE STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE ACCOUNT BUT WE WERE NOT DISCUSSING THOSE COSTS AT THE WHITE REPLACEMENT RATE OF 90% I WONDER IF THE LA -- CAN OPINE AS TO WHAT THE IPACT ON THAT FUND WOULD BE. WITH THE REPLACEMENT AT THAT RATE [inaudible] HI [inaudible] AND QUESTION. ASSEMBLY PERCENTAGE BELIAU WELCOME. THANK YOU CAROLYN SHE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE HAVE NOT DONE THAT SPECIFIC ANALYSIS -- AS YET THAT SAID -- WE HAD ESTIMATED -- PREVIOUSLY THAT UNDER EXISTING LAW THE STATE COULD EXPAND -- BENEFITS BY ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS THE CURRENT REPLACEMENT -- WE'D REPLACE THE RATE IS 60% GOING UP UP WE HAVE TO REALLY RUN THE NUMBERS AND LOOK AT THAT TO TO TELL YOU EXACTLY WHAT IT WOULD MEAN UNDER EXISTING CURRENT LAW. OKAY SO JUST. BACK OF THE ENVELOPE. WHEN WE WERE DISCUSSING AT LAST WEEK? THE US SAID THAT'D BE ABOUT A POINT 1% ADDITION TO THE STI PAYROLL TAX. IN OTHER WORDS A 10% OVERALL. INCREASE TO THE COST PRESSURES ON THE FUND. FOR THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO MOVE FROM SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS THAT'S CORRECT. AND IT IT ACTUALLY MEAN. IT THE IT'S NOT AN INCREASE IN THE RATE FROM YEAR TO YEAR UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT MEANS THE RATE WILL NOT GO DOWN IN NINETEEN TWENTY WHICH OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE OCCURRED ABSENT THE GOVERNOR'S. PROPOSAL. TO THE MAXIMUM RATE IS A ONE ONE HALF PERCENT CORRECT AND I I BELIEVE WE ARE AT ONE NOW AND WE WILL GO WE WOULD GO TO A ONE ONE ONE TWO UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO GO FROM SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS. OKAY AND SO IT LOOKS AS WE WOULD WE WOULD STAY AT ONE VERSUS GOING TO POINT NINE I'M SORRY OKAY SO I MEAN TO PUT IT A DIFFERENT WHEN AND I WOULD IMAGINE THIS IS GONNA BE ABOUT IF WE GO FROM A WAY TO REPLACE RATE OF 60% 290%. ARE WELL YOUR YOUR INCREASING THE WAGE REPLACEMENT RATE WITH KERR UP BY ABOUT 50% THAT'S CORRECT I THINK IT WOULD DEPEND ON TAKE UP AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF TAKE UP AN INDIVIDUAL'S WAGES UNDER. OKAY WHAT LET ME TELL YOU MY CONCERN BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO PROLONG THE DISCUSSION BUT IF. IF IT'S WERE TALK ABOUT A POINT ESSENTIALLY TAX ON ALL PAYROLL IN CALIFORNIA IS PLAYED BY THE EMPLOYEES. THE AVERAGE PAY THE WAGES CALIFORNIA'S ABOUT SIXTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR LAST YEAR SO ESSENTIALLY WE'RE TAKING IF WE ADOPT THIS TODAY WE'RE pTHE AVERAGE PAY A PERSON IN CALIFORNIA'S PAYCHECK TO DO I GET THAT RIGHT. I BELIEVE IF I WAS FALLING MATH CORRECTLY AYE AYE AYE TH I THINK THAT IS CORRECT OKAY WELL THAT THAT'S MY CONCERN I MEAN I THINK THE IN THE DISCUSSION WE'VE BEEN HAVING WE'RE PRETENDING THAT THIS HAS NO COSTS. BUT IT REALLY DOES EVERY EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA WOULD BE ASKED TO PAY -- SIXTY TWO DOLLARS A YEAR OR WHEN DOING IT THE OTHER WAY ABOUT NINETY DOLLARS A YEAR TO PAY FOR THIS AND THAT'S MY CONCERN BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FOR FOR CHECK IN MY MATH ON THAT.

THE FINAL ITEM. OF STATE WIDE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. THE COP WITH COMPROMISE WAS TO REDUCE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS. FINANCE STATE POLICE DEPARTMENT FINANCE OF THIS A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS -- PRODUCTION IS DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN NINETEEN DEPARTMENTS [inaudible] QUESTIONS [inaudible] THIRTY NIELSEN. YES. SO A HUNDRED MILLION. FROM OF DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS NOT NOW NECESSARY. ONE IS CHANGED IN THE LAST WEEKS MONTHS THAT HAVE. ELIMINATED THE NEED TO FOR A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR EXPENDITURE. FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS AT ALL TAKEN CARE OF BY ITSELF. ARE WE GETTING VOLUNTEERS TO DO THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE SORT OF BEING A LITTLE FACETIOUS HERE BUT THIS IS A PRETTY. SIGNIFICANT CUT IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND WE HAVE BEEN TRYING STARTED WITH JEFF GOVERNOR BROWN TO GET CAUGHT UP. ON DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PERFECTLY IN THE SACRAMENTO AREA SO. WHITE WHY SO LATE. SO THE STATE'S DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS EXCEED IN ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION TWO HUNDRED NINE DOLLARS SO IN ANY GIVEN BUDGET THE QUESTION IS WHAT CAN WE DO GIVEN. THE OTHER PRIORITIES THAT WE HAVE IN THE BUDGET AND SO THIS BUDGET -- A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS STILL IS IN THE BUDGET FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WE ALSO HAVE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ALLOCATIONS FOR UC AND CSU. SO WE THINK GIVEN THE OTHER PRIORITIES THAT WE HAVE TO BALANCE IN THIS BUDGET HI THIS IS STILL A MEANINGFUL INVESTMENT IN WHAT WILL THIS. ONE HUNDRED MILLION BE SPENT ON SO IT'S STILL IS -- AS SAID THE SHEET IN FRONT OF YOU SHOULD REFLECT -- IT MAY HAVE BEEN TAKEN DOWN FROM -- THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THE ALLOCATION THAT WE HAD THEIR BACKS ALL THESE NINETEEN PROJECTS I BELIEVE ARE ALL STILL RECEIVING. APPLICATIONS HI CHRIS CAN SPEAK TO SOME OF THE DETAILS PLEASE. YES SO WE OF THESE TO THESE TO PUT NINETEEN DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE BEING REDUCED THEY HAD MEANS THAT EXCEEDED THE INITIAL ALLOCATION THAT WE GAVE THEM SO -- THAT THEY WILL JUST NOT GET AS FAR ON THEIR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE LIST WITH THIS MONEY AS THEY WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE. GOTTEN [inaudible] MADAM CHAIR. THE MORE LOT. USUALLY YOU CUT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND A RECESSIONARY PERIOD -- SO FOR DOING IT WHEN WE HAVE A TWENTY ONE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS. THAT MEANS THAT THAT HUNDRED MILLION WENT TO OTHER THINGS WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE SAYING THAT THOSE OTHER THINGS ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN [inaudible] MAINTAINING OUR OUR FACILITIES AND WE WE TEND TO HAVE A HABIT AS GOVERNMENTS. TO WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY FOR REPAIRS. THEN WE DON'T ACT LIKE A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION WERE PUTTING MONEY ASIDE EVERY MONTH EVERY YEAR. TO PREPARE FOR YOU KNOW RESURFACING ROADS AND RE DOING ALL THESE THINGS WE JUST SORT OF WAKE UP AND ACT LIKE. WELL NEXT WEEK IS CHRISTMAS AND WHAT WE FIND THE MONEY TO PAY FOR THE GIPSON YADA YADA. AND SO. MAYBE AS YOU. ENJOY THIS NEW POSITION THEY ALWAYS ARE LOOKING AT HOW DO WE ACT MORE LIKE A HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION WHERE WERE. PUTTING MONEY ASIDE SYSTEMATICALLY. SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE A SURPRISE WHEN WE HAVE TO REPAIR A LEVY OR A ROAD OR A OR WE WOULDN'T WHATEVER IT MAY BE -- BUT THIS ALSO KIND OF IS IS IS MAYBE. AN INDICATOR OF A OF MAYBE THAT THIS ISN'T THE BEST BUDGET. IF WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS KIND OF ADJUSTMENT. IN A IN A GREAT YEAR. SO I'M I'M I'M JUST A LITTLE CONCERNED I JUST WANTED TO AT LEAST SHARE THOSE CONCERNS YES. ARE YOU TAKING FOR THE LONG TERM IS CERTAINLY THE APPROACH OR HOW YOU ADDRESS THESE ISSUES I WOULD JUST SAY TWO THINGS ONE IS THAT -- IT IS A REDUCTION FROM OUR PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL BUT I WOULDN'T CHARACTERIZE IT AS A COP YOU KNOW IT'S STILL A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- THAT IF THIS BUDGET IS ENACTED THAT WILL GO TOWARD DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN FOR HOW WE'RE GOING TO BALANCE THESE PRIORITIES AND THAT SHOULD BE OUT THIS YEAR AS WELL YES [inaudible] SIX QUESTIONS. THE MOTION IS -- THE COMPROMISE AS STATED NEED GENDER WITHIN ASSEMBLY VOTE OF THREE TO ONE AND THE SENATE VOTE OF THREE TWO ONE COLLEGE WE'VE COME TO THE POINT IN THE BUDGET CONFERENCE COMMITTEE -- TIME WHERE IT IS REQUIRED THAT WE ALL SIGN THE BUDGET CONFERENCE REPORT.
