BRADFORD YOUR RECORD HERE THE TROUBLE- BUG HERE. COM LONGER HERE. COM LARGER HERE SCANNER. SCANNER HERE WINNER THERE THE CORN OKAY THERE'S CORN HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NOW WE'LL HEAR FROM OUR FIRST AUTHOR AND- I WILL PRESENT MY BILL AT THIS TIME. SP THREE TO FIVE AND I WILL HAND THE GAVEL OVER TO SENATOR COME. WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROCEED. I'M HERE I'M HERE TO PRESENT SP THREE TO FIVE WHICH IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD MEASURE THAT ADDS AN ADDITIONAL MEMBER TO THE GANG CAL GANG DATABASE TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE THE CAL GAME DATABASES MAINTAINED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN USE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ACROSS THE STATE TO STORE THE NAMES OF OVER FORTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE. SUSPECTED OF BEING ACTIVE GANG MEMBERS ARE POSSIBLY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM OUR RECENT STATE AUDIT FILED THAT THE DATABASE IT INADEQUATE. OVERSIGHT WHICH RESULTED IN UNRELIABLE INFORMATION THAT POTENTIALLY VIOLATE INDIVIDUALS PRIVACY RIGHTS THIS RESULTED IN QUESTIONABLE ENTRIES AN INCLUSION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH NO GANG AFFILIATION INCLUDING CHILDREN AND ALL TOO OFTEN BLACK AND BROWN INDIVIDUALS. THE GANG CAL THE CAL GAME DATABASE ALLOWS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO REQUEST THE REMOVAL FOM THE DATABASE AFTER RECEIVING NOTICE FROM LOCAL. LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES BETWEEN OCTOBER TWENTY NINETEEN IT SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY FORTY REQUEST FOR REMOVAL WERE MADE BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN ONLY TEN WERE GRANTED UNFORTUNATELY MANY INDIVIDUALS OFTEN CHOOSE NOT TO PURSUE REMOVAL AS IT IS A COSTLY AND TIME CONSUMING. THIS BILL WOULD ADD AN ATTORNEY WITH SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIENCE IN CONTESTING THE INDIVIDUAL'S DESIGNATION AS A GANG MEMBER TO THE CAL GAME ADVISORY COMMITTEE. INCLUDING THIS REPRESENTATION WILL HELP ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE DATABASE AS WELL AS STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY TRUST AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROTECT INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES AT RISK OF BEING. INAPPROPRIATELY LABELED AS GANG AFFILIATED. THIS BILL SHOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF A LARGER CONVERSATION. WE HAVE ABOUT THE CAL GAME SYSTEM. BLACK ANTI LATINO MEN MAKE UP THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF INDIVIDUALS ON THIS DATABASE AGAIN THERE'S FORTY THOUSAND INTO OTHER FORTY THOUSAND ISIS SAY. OUR I SHOULD SAY FORTY THOUSAND OF THE FORTY FIVE THOUSAND ON DATABASE ARE BLACK AND BROWN INDIVIDUALS. IT'S OUTRAGEOUS TO BELIEVE THAT WITH THE RAPID GROWTH A WHITE SUPREMACIST GANGS IN THE UNITED STATES IN RECENT YEARS ONLY 7% OF THE TOTAL RECORDS IN THE DATABASE OR WHITE INDIVIDUALS. THIS IS CONTINUE TO PERPETUATE ITSELF THE PRINT PRINT PRINT PRINT PERPETUATE THE MYTH DOCTORS SAY THAT ONLY BLACK LATINO AND ASIAN PEOPLE ARE GANG MEMBERS. WHEN IN REALITY WHITE SUPREMACIST GANGS AROUND BUT AS WELL I HAVE RECENTLY BEEN MADE AWARE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT'S CONCERNS WITH THIS MEASURE AND I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH THEM TO ADDRESS THESE MINOR CONCERNS. AS IS MY MAJOR MOVES FORWARD AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU.

WRITTEN UP FOR TOO LATE EITHER DELAY FOR PAROLE FOR UNFAIRLY CONSIDERED CONTROL BECAUSE OF. OF THE INDICATION THAT THEY HAVE A GANG AFFILIATION WITH AND WITHOUT. WITH WHAT. IS I MEAN WHAT.

US AS SOMEONE NUMBER THEN SOMEONE NUMBER WHATEVER WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT. ARE YOUR COMMENTS ON THAT.I AM UNFAMILIAR WITH THAT COMPROMISE BUT ARE WELL AWARE OF THE BILL THAT DR WEBBER. HAS DONE AND I THINK THIS ONLY ENHANCES WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND MAKING SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT. A WRONGLY PLACED ON GANG DATABASES SO I DON'T THINK THERE IS A CONFLICT IN WHICH- WITH ACTION TODAY- THAT WHICH- NOW SECRETARY OF STATE WEBER AUTHORIZED A FEW YEARS AGO. SENATE AVAILABLE DID YOU HAVE A FOLLOW UP. THAT'S IT THANK YOU YOU. I'M A SINNER BRADFORD I JUST ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR- RAINING AND THEY'RE STILL FOR YOU KNOW I WORKED ON AB THREE THREE THREE AND THE ISSUE AROUND GANG DATABASES ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND I THINK ACTUALLY ADDING THIS KIND OF MEMBER. TO THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE THOSE THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE- NOT JUST PROSECUTING THAT SORT OF WORKING ON THE DEFENDANT AND DUE PROCESS SIDE. HAVE A LOT OF EXPERTISE IN THE FIELD OF. HOW WHO AND HOW OFTEN PEOPLE ARE PLACED ON THE DATABASE WHAT KIND OF CRITERIA IS USED WHAT KIND OF SUBJECTIVITY IS USED. WITH REGARD TO THAT KIND OF CRITERIA AND IT COULD POTENTIALLY. OPEN UP- DISCUSSIONS TO BE A LITTLE MORE TRANSPARENT A LITTLE MORE REFLECTIVE A LITTLE MORE HONEST- AND SOBERING WITH REGARDS TO HOW THE K. GAL. HOW GETTING DATABASE IS USED- AND ENFORCED YOU KNOW COUNTY BY COUNTY ACROSS THE STATE AND FEDERAL. AND AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR.

AS C. TWO SIX ARE SHOWN AS IN DOUBT AS SHOWN. YOU HAVE KIDS SIMPLY LIVING IN THE WRONG NEIGHBORHOOD WHO HAVE BEEN PUT ON GAME DAY GRUB DATABASES YOU HAVE. SENIORS WHO HAVE BEEN STOPPED SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY LIVE IN A GANG INFESTED NEIGHBORHOOD AND THEY TOO HAVE BEEN PUT ON A GAME DATABASE AND I THINK THIS MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE WE- KNOW THE- LONG- RAIN IMPACTS OF BEING ON THIS.

R. SEVENTY FIVE ADDS THAT NOW TO THE LIST OF DANGEROUS DRUGS INCLUDING HEROIN AND COCAINE. WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON WEIGHT IT IS UP TO FIFTY TIMES MORE POTENT THAN PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE HEROIN IS OFTEN MIXED WITH HEROIN AND OTHER DRUGS WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF USERS HOWEVER IT IS NOW BEING IMPORTED UNITS UP YOUR FIRM FORM BECAUSE OF FENTANYL'S POTENCY OVERDOSES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE FATAL IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FAT NAIL CAN BE DEADLY SIMPLY IF IT BECOMES AIRBORNE OR MAKES CONTACT WITH SKIN POSING SIGNIFICANT DANGER. TO FIRST RESPONDERS AS SHOWN IN THE GRAPH THAT I HOPE YOU ALL HAVE A VIEW OF NOW WE'VE PROVIDED YOU- THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ESTIMATES THAT FENTANYL RELATED DEATHS SKYROCKETED BY OVER 1000% STATEWIDE BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY MORE SPECIFICALLY THE OVERDOSES ROSE FROM TWO HUNDRED AND ONE IN pFIFTIETH THE KIDS THINK SPEAK VOLUMES TO THE NEED FOR THE BILL IT CRACKS DOWN ON DRUG CARTELS AND HIGH LEVEL DRUG DEALERS THAT ARE DISTRIBUTING TRAFFICKING AND SELLING MASS QUANTITIES OF THIS POISON THE BILL WOULD ONLY GO INTO EFFECT SOMEONE IS CAUGHT WITH IT. MORE MORE THE KILOGRAM OF FENTANYL HELD A STREET VALUE OF ANYWHERE FROM ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO SEVERAL MILLION IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT POSITION OF THIS AMOUNT IS SOMEWHAT RARE WHEN I FIRST INTRODUCEDTHE BILL IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN IT WAS. I BELIEVE THE MOST SELLERS COULD CAUSE. MY AS LIKE. OF INCLUDING MANY HIGH. LEVEL DEALER HOWEVER THERE HAS A THIRD INCREASE. IN C. OF. THAT EXCEED ONE KILOGRAM. AND JUST THE PAST FOUR WEEKS. THE ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF SEE THE KILO OF FENTANYL WE NEED TO SEND A pIS EVEN WORSE. SB SEVENTY FIVE COULD REDUCE FUTURE TRAFFICKING LEVEL. THE BILL DOES NOT CHANGE SENTENCES FOR END USERS ARE FOR THOSE USING MEDICAL FAT NOW FOR ITS LEGITIMATE AND PRESCRIBED PURPOSE. THE BILL GIVES LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY NEEDED TOOL TO PREVENT AN EPIDEMIC. OF DEATHS AND OVERDOSES HAPPENING THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. FIVE TWO WITNESSES WITH ME TODAY. THE FIRST OF MARCH COUNTY SHRIFF DON BAR. HE WILL STAY ON THE LINE TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS IF NEEDED AND SECONDLY IF THE MEDIA WILL. BE CONSTITUENT FROM MY DISTRICT. YOU'RE FAR TOO PREMIER WITNESSES ARE PREPARED WE WILL PROVIDE YOU TWO MINUTES EACH SO- WE'LL START WITH THE SHERIFF PLEASE BEAR. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN I MET AND AFTER THIS COMMITTEE ONCE AGAIN TO HELP ADDRESS. WITH THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC SAFETY HEALTH CRISIS OF OUR TIME FENTANYL. THIS BILL COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE SEVERAL TIMES THAT'S BEEN REPEATEDLY REJECTED. CONSEQUENTLY AS EACH YEAR PASSES MORE PEOPLE DIE IN THE PROLIFERATION OF FENTANYL GROWS COMMITTEE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN TO SENATOR SPECIFICALLY STATED ONE THE PEOPLE ARE NOT DYING AT A DISPROPORTIONATE RATE COMPARED TO OTHER DRUGS. AND TO THAT FENTANYL IS ALWAYS MIXED WITH OTHER DRUGS MAKING THIS LEGISLATION UNNECESSARY. WITH THESE TWO STATEMENTS THE MIND LET'S LOOK AT OUR MOST RECENT DATA. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN THE NUMBER STATEWIDE FENTANYL DEATHS WITH SEVEN HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX. IN TWENTY TWENTY DEATHS ROSE 230-009-0040 SIX. A 4100% INCREASE THAT'S ON PACE TO DOUBLE AGAIN IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SENATOR WINNER DURING THE SAME THREE APPARENT FENTANYL DEATHS IN SAN FRANCISCO INCREASED FOURTEEN FIFTY PERCENT. SENATOR BRADFORD IN CALM WATER. SAMPLES INCREASED THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO PERCENT. SENATOR JOE ABOUT SABATINO INCREASED SIX HUNDRED FIFTY SIX PERCENT. AND SENATOR SKINNER ALAMEDA COUNTY SON ALARMING INCREASE OF. 710035% AND DENTAL RELATED DEATHS. REGARDING THE SECOND THAT SENTINELS ALWAYS MIXED WITH OTHER DRUGS MY DEPARTMENT ALONE HAS SEIZED NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS OF PURE FENTANYL OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. IN FACT THE FAILURE OF THIS COMMITTEE TO RECOGNIZE THE LEGITIMATE RAFT CALIFORNIA. HAS CREATED A PERVERSE INCENTIVE ENCOURAGING DRUG CARTELS TO TRAFFIC BUREAUCRAT TO NOW. THAT THE CONSEQUENCESFOR DOING SO ARE LESS THAN TRAFFICKING ARGUABLY LESS DANGEROUS NARCOTICS. THE SENATE WHAT THE SOLUTION IS SIMPLE. RECTOR THE DISPARITY IN SENTENCING LAWS. DOESN'T MAKE CLEAR THAT THOSE PROFITING FROM THE LIVES OF OTHERS WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN THE SAME MANNER FOR TRAFFICKING OTHER DANGEROUS NARCOTICS. YOU CAN NO LONGER IGNORE OR EXPLAIN AWAY THE REST YOUR CONSTITUENTS. THE SUPPORT COMMONSENSE LEGISLATION THAT WILL PROTECT THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA VOTE YES ON SB.

AND IF OUR INCREASING CORPORATION FOR THE STRONG WERE- OR AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY- I THINK HAVING A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD BE OPEN TO IT BUT WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT IT'S NOT. AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY AND OF MR BACCHUS POINTED OUT- WE WERE INCREASING IT HAPPENS FOR OTHER DRUGS. ARE FOR MANY YEARS. AND PEOPLE ARE. STILL DYING FROM THE DRUGS AND EVEN MORE MORE SO IN THE- AND SO I. YOU KNOW WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THIS IS A TEST AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER- BUT IT'S- ADDING AN ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENT IS NOT GOING TO- THE TO SOLVE OR IMPROVE THIS- DISASTER- POLICE AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ALREADY HAVE TOOLS ON TO ADDRESS THE SOON TO SEND PEOPLE TO STAY PRESENT- FOR POSSESSING LARGE QUANTITIES OF FENTANYL. I DON'T THINK THAT INCREASING THE LENGTH OF AN INCARCERATION IS GOING TO- SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS WE SHOULD BE DOING OR WORKING ON SOME OF THOSE FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE I. AM LISTENING TO A NUMBER OF OTHER STRATEGIES FOR EXAMPLE THIS YEAR I'M FOCUSED ON TRYING TO EXPAND ACCESS TO FENTANYL TESTING STRIPS OF THE PEOPLE ON THE THESE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TRAGEDIES OF PEOPLE TAKING UP WHAT THEY THINK OF THE PERCOCET OR OR OR OTHER- HELLO AND ENDS UP BEING LACED WITH SOMETHING ON A GUY. WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE INGESTING SO THERE ARE STRATEGIES THAT I THINK- CAN HELP- BUT UGH I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU TERROR AND- THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER FOR YOUR COMMENTS- SENATOR BATES I SHARE THE HORROR AT. THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE DIED ON KNOWINGLY BECAUSE THEY HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE WAS FENTANYL IN THE THING THEY WERE INTERESTING FOR POTENTIALLY SHOOTING UP. AND WHILE THERE'S A LEVEL OF RISK. THAT I CERTAINLY AM NOT WILLING TO TAKE IN ANY KIND OF INJECTION DRUG. WE KNOW THAT MANY OF THE FENTANYL DEATHS ARE DUE TO PEOPLE TAKING WHAT THEY THINK ARE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THE BOUGHT ILLEGALLY IN BOUGHT ON THE BLACK MARKET BUT STILL THEY THINK THAT THEY ARE RIGHT THEY ARE GETTING A PRESCRIPTION DRUG. AND FROM THAT POINT OF VIEW I. AGREE WITH THOSE FAMILIES TO DESCRIBE IT IS THESE ARE NOT OVERDOSE DEATHS. THESE ARE POISONING THESE ARE AND WHILE. WHILE THERE IS A USE FOR FAT KNOWING. SOME LEVEL OF PAIN TREATMENT. I WOULD I WOULD. I WOULDN'T TREAT THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY TO COME UP WITH ALTERNATIVES THAT WE WOULD NOT EVEN UTILIZE THAT NO IN A HEALTH STUDY THAT THERE MUST BE OTHER WAYS TO CONTROL PAIN BECAUSE OF THE TOXICITY OF THIS PARTICULAR SUBSTANCE SO IN AN INTERESTING WAY I THINK WE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE DEALING WITH IT IN ANY OF OUR DRESS CODE. BECAUSE IT'S A IT'S A POISONOUS A TOXIN NOW CERTAINLY WHEN SOMEONE OVERDOSES FROM LIKE A STRICT STRICT DRUG NOT DENTAL LACE ONE COULD SAY THAT WAS POISONOUS TO BUT THAT IS A VERY DIFFERENT. THE NATURE OF IT IS VERY DIFFERENT- AND HOW WE GET AT. BOTH REDUCING PEOPLE'S USE OF THINGS THAT COULD BE FENTANYL LACED FOR THE IMPORT OF ANTI. THE SELLING OF SENTINEL I THINK OUR THOSE ARE VERY THOSE ARE WORTHWHILE THINGS FOR US TO BE DEBATING AND DISCUSSING BUT I THINK OUR- WHAT HAS PROVEN IS THAT. WE HAVE SIMILAR PENALTIES FOR SAY SALE HERE ONE. SAILOR VARIOUS OTHER SUBSTANCES SUBSTANCES AND IT HAS NOT REDUCED THE SALE OF THE SUBSTANCES. AND SO WHILE I COMPLETELY I APPRECIATE THE VERY LEGITIMATE STRONG AND NATURAL DESIRE FOR ANYONE WHO HAD A LOVED ONE FRIEND ANYONE THEY WERE CLOSE TO WHO DIED FROM FENTANYL ESPECIALLY THOSE UNKNOWINGLY THAT THEY WANT ACTION. I THINK THIS ACTION ISN'T GOING TO GET US THE REDUCTION THAT WE WOULD WANT. SO I AND I HAD A LONG CONVERSATION SOME EMAILS BACK AND FORTH A LONG CONVERSATION WITH STAFF ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE APPROACHES THAT COULD ACTUALLY GET. THIS STUFF OUT OF CIRCULATION. AND I THINK WE DON'T. AT LEAST WE DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT YET- AND WHETHER WHETHER THERE ARE STRATEGIES THAT HAVE BEEN USED. INTERESTINGLY I WAS IN PORTUGAL IN OCTOBER THE ONLY TIME I'VE TRAVELED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS AND AT THE POINT I TRAVELED THERE WAS AN OMICRON PRESENT AT PORTUGAL HAD THE HIGHEST VACCINATION RATES SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE I HAD A LITTLE FANTASY BLOOPERS. COVERT SAFETY BUT THE POINT BEING IS THAT IN PORTUGAL OFFICIALS PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AND- LAW ENFORCEMENT DRUG OFFICIALS IN PORTUGAL THEY HAVE LEGALIZED THERE THE OPIOID USE OR LEGALIZE IS NOT QUITE RIGHT THEY HAVEN'T CRIMINALIZED IT IN THE SAME WAY. AND WHILE THEY HAVEN'T QUITE SAID IT'S LEGAL THEY DON'T CRIMINALIZE IT AND THEY PROVIDE- ON METHADONE OR THEY PROVIDE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE AT AND- WE ASKED THEM ABOUT THAT NO. BECAUSE CLEARLY THAT KNOWS A WORLDWIDE PROBLEM. AND THEY HAVE HAD VERY LITTLE PRESENCE OF FENTANYL IN PORTUGAL AND THERE ARE VERY FEW OVERDOSES AND BECAUSE WHAT WE CALL OVERDOSES IN MANY CASES ARE REALLY A OPIOID DOES SPEND AWAY FROM THE PERSON. DIES BECAUSE THE FEDERAL. SO I WAS VERY STRUCK THAT. NOW WHETHER WE COULD ELIMINATE FAT NO WORD MINIMIZE IT IN THAT WAY HERE IN CALIFORNIA I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WE HAVE THE APPETITE TO I DON'T KNOW BUT I WAS VERY STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT. PORTUGAL COMPARED TO EUROPEAN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN COMPARED TO US. HAS LITTLE TO NO PRESENCE OF FENTANYL- SO WHY I VERY MUCH. WHAT- GREENWAY. TRYING TO IDENTIFY APPROACHES TO GET THIS STUFF OUT OF CIRCULATION ANSYS STOCK HAVING PEOPLE POISONED AND DYING FROM THIS BUT I DON'T THINK THE APPROACH THAT'S BEING PRESENTED TO US TODAY IT'S GOING TO KEEP THE CALL. THAT YOU HAVE THAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT OF COURSE THE PEOPLE WHO SUFFERED THE STRATEGIES APPLE. THANK YOU SENATOR CALM WATER THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO- ALIGN MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF. MY COLLEAGUES FROM BERKELEY AND SAN FRANCISCO I AM ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN THINKING A LOT ABOUT THEM ALL- MOSTLY BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE BEEN READING IN THE PAPERS AND SEEING ON THE NEWS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN LOS ANGELES- UPTAKE IN DEATH. UPTICK IN YOUNG PEOPLE USING FENTANYL- YOU KNOW RECOGNIZING THAT YOU KNOW THE SUPPLY CHAIN HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL ON EVERYTHING FROM PEOPLE BEING ABLE. TO PURCHASE THE RIGHT KIND OF MATTRESSES AND PARTS FOR THEIR CARS TO DRUGS YOU KNOW. FENNEL IS CHEAP TO MANUFACTURE. A WE HAVE INCREDIBLY POROUS BORDERS- AND IT IS ENORMOUSLY PROFITABLE. WE ARE AND ON TOP OF THAT. WE HAVE A VERY SCHIZOPHRENIC APPROACH TO. HOW WE ACKNOWLEDGE. AND DEAL WITH THE DRUG CULTURE THAT IS- YOU KNOW ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. AND WE HAVEN'T EVEN QUITE FIGURED OUT HOW TO GRAPPLE WITH THE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS THATALLOW FOR THE SALE. OF DRUGS- I KNOW THAT THERE WERE HEARINGS- IN DC ABOUT THIS AND- TOOK A LITTLE AVAIL. I WAS READING UP ON THIS BILL. AND ALSO LOOKING AT CASES. A RELATED TO FEDERAL AND OTHER RELATES TO ENHANCEMENTS. THERE WAS SOMEONE WHO A GENTLEMAN WAS CHARGED WITH A TEN MILLION DOLLAR FINE AND TEND TO LIE FOR POSSESSION ANOTHER PERSON GOT THIRTY THREE YEARS FOR POSSESSION ANOTHER MAN GOT LIFE FOR TRAFFICKING. SO IT SEEMS TO ME THAT CHARGES ARE AVAILABLE AND THEY'RE USED IN PEOPLE ARE GETTING- TIME AND LOTS OF TIME. FOR EITHER THE MANUFACTURE THE SALE OF THE POSSESSION OF FENTANYL WHICH I THINK IS WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO SPEAK TO SO I WONDER. THEN THEN THE FASTER THE FOR THIS. AND SUBSEQUENTLY I ACTUALLY WONDER- AND SO AS A RESULT OF THAT I DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED SOMETHING LIKE THIS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IT WILL GET TO THE HEART OF THE PROBLEM SINCE WE ALSO HAVE TOOLS THAT ARE BEING USED BY OUR PROSECUTORS WITH REGARDS TO FOLKS WHO ARE MANUFACTURING AND- SELLING FENTANYL AND THERE ARE SOME PROSECUTORS- ARE THERE SOME DA'S IN CERTAIN COUNTIES WHO ARE SAYING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO UP pDEALERS SOLD SO THAT KIND OF WORK IS ALREADY HAPPENING WITH REGARDS TO- PUNISHMENT. I'M ACTUALLY WONDERING WHAT WE CAN DO TO GET TO THE HEART OF THE ISSUE WHICH IS WHY FOLKS ARE FEELING COMPELLED TO USE IT WHY IT IS SO HOW DO WE CRACKED DOWN ON MAKING IT LESS EASILY AVAILABLE OR ATTRACTIVE- SO THAT WE CAN HOPEFULLY PAVE IT. AND BE PREPARED FOR THE NEXT WAVE OF THE NEXT NEW AND CHEAPER AND MORE DEADLY DRUGS. THAT WILL PROBABLY COME TO US- AND THEN WHAT CAN WE DO TO REALLY BUY ACTRESS OUR COMMUNITIES AGAINST THAT- AND I DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW THAT THIS IS THE BILL FOR THAT. BUT I AM WITH YOU WHEN WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO BE INVOLVED IN SOMETHING AS IT RELATES TO DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF FEDERAL BECAUSE- YOU KNOW WITH. IT'S KILLING EVERYBODY YOU KNOW FOLKS WANT TO HAVE A PARTY AND GET INTO SOMETHING AND PRETEND THAT THEY'RE SINGLE AND THEY TAKE A DRUG AND IT'S GOT PHENYL AND THEN. THEY DIE AND IT'S LIKE LOU OR- YOUNG PEOPLE FEELING LIKE THEY NEED SOME KIND OF COCKTAIL AND THEY TAKE SOMETHING THAT HAS IT AND THEN YOU KNOW SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS- THE HEART OF IT IS THE CARTELS IN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE POROUS BORDERS AND THE FACT THAT IT'S REALLY CHEAP TO MANUFACTURE AND IT'S INCREDIBLY SYMPATHETIC AND SO IT'S HARD THAT. YOU KNOW SORT OF- IDENTIFY SO I WOULD BE REALLY INTERESTED IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT BECAUSE- PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CHARGED AND HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED FOR LIFE SENTENCES I WONDER ABOUT THE NECESSITY FOR THE ENHANCEMENT WHICH IS WHY I AM HAVING TROUBLE SUPPORTING THIS. PERIOD VERY INTERESTED IN SOMETHING THAT CAN GET TO THE HEART OF I THINK THE CONCERN THAT ALL OF US HAVE BECAUSE IT'S RAVAGING. REALLY ALL COMMUNITIES AND- VERY INTERESTED IN WHAT WE CAN DO BUT WONDERING ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS PARTICULAR- IDEA AND PROPOSAL. YEAH BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A RESPONSE MAYBE EVEN FROM THE WITNESS ABOUT THE FACT THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CHARGED AND INCARCERATED EVEN FOR LIFE SENTENCES FOR- THE SALE AND POSSESSION OF CRIMINAL. ENTER TO TALK TO CHARLOTTE. WELL I THINK THAT'S A VERY INTERESTING- RESEARCH THAT YOU DID ON THAT TELEPHONE INTERCOM LONGER AND I'D LIKE TO ASK OUR SHARE OF DON BARNES MIGHT RESPOND TO THAT SINCE THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE. GOTTEN VERY THEORY OFFENSE BEING OFF FOR INVOLVEMENT WITH THAT NO ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AND I THINK THAT YOUR. FARMS MIGHT STILL BE ON THE LINE. ARE YOU THERE. YES I AM AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE- ALTHOUGH I DON'T AGREE WITH THE DIRECTION I THINK THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE YOU KNOW HONORED SURPRISE NEXT YEAR WHEN THE NUMBER KEEPS EDGES THAT DOUBLE IT NOTHING IS BEING DONE- THE SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION WERE FOCUSED ON END USERS NOT ON DEALERS THEY FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON THE END USERS I'M ALL IN FOR TREATMENT BY JILL HAS BETWEEN FIVE AND FIFTEEN SEVEN TWENTY FIVE PEOPLE IN MEDICINE ASSISTED TREATMENT FOR OPIATE ADDICTION. ON ANY GIVEN DAY AND WE'VE GONE ALL IN ON TREATMENT FOR THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING ADDICTION ISSUES AND I DON'T DISAGREE WITH ANYBODY ABOUT GETTING PEOPLE BACK ON THEIR FEET APPROPRIATELY BUT THE DEFENDANT THING IS AT THE FLAWED ARGUMENT FOR EXAMPLE ONE KILO OF FENTANYL ALL ITS EQUIPMENT OF FIFTY KILOS OF OPIUM OR HEROIN. THE MAP BUT AT THEIR TRAFFIC INTO TWO KILOS OF HEROIN THAT WOULD BE IF THE TWENTY YEAR SENTENCE UNDER EXISTING LAWS IT'S CHEAP TO PRODUCE. EASTER TRAFFIC. TAKING THE DRUG OF CHOICE FOR TRAFFIC. AND THE SENECA MARKER YOU MEDICAL ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO THAT WHEN THE NEXT TWO TO COMES WELL IT'S CALLED. IT'S ONE HUNDRED TIMES MORE POTENT FENTANYL WHICH IS FIFTY TIMES MORE POTENT. THAN MORPHINE. THEY'RE ALREADY THINKING THAT SEARCH FOR THE NEW SEARCH- OF CARFENTANIL. WHICH IS COMPLETELY RESISTANT TO NALOXONE ORIGINAL ROCKS ON PROGRAM IT'S AN OPEN ATTACKING THIS. WITH MY DEPARTMENT INTRODUCED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WITH WITH BOB BOB FIRST PRESENT ABOUT FENTANYL. ON THE WEST COAST THROUGH MY CRIME LAB. AND I'VE SAVED HUNDREDS OF LIVES AS A RESULT OF BADAKHSHAN PROGRAM. WHICH NUMBERS DO NOT GET COUNTED ON THOSE OVERDOSE DEATH IN ABOUT A MONTH FOR SOME AGENCIES. SO THEY COULD AFFECT THE NUMBER PROGRAM WITHIN THAT. I THINK IS TROUBLING TO ME IS ALL OF YOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH THE FASTER CENTER WIENER. OFFENDERS CAN I CAN TELL YOU THAT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS NOT PROVIDING. IT THE MEDIC THAT THE MEDICINE CONTROLLED MEDICAL CONTROL STEPHANOPOULOS AND- CONTROL FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING YOU KNOW LAST CHAPTER THE RIGHT USUALLY FOR CANCER- CONTROLLING CANCER PAIN IT IS IN THE HEALTHCARE ISSUE IT'S CLANDESTINE PRODUCED. FENTANYL COMING SOUTH OF THE BORDER. BY THAT TIME AND IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO SO. THE NARCOTICS COME ACROSS THAT ARE. CLANDESTINE PROTEST PILLS THAN ACTS OXYCONTIN OXY CODE OWN. ARE BEING TRAFFICKED. NOT LACED WITH FENTANYL AS ONE OF THE SENATORS- STAYED AT. YOU SENATOR WIENER THAT'S NO PHARMACY QUALITY IN IT THAT ONLY HAVE SPENT ABOUT. THAT BEING SOLD AS A PHARMACEUTICAL. THE RISK OF INCREASING YEAR TO YEAR- THIS IS NOT A- WE'RE CREATING NEW DEMAND BECAUSE ACCORDING TO YOU ADDICTS. AND THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS PERFECT AND I WAS GOING THROUGH THE ROOF BUT WE DID DO SOMETHING TO DISRUPT. THE SUPPLY. AND DISCOURAGE. PEOPLE FOR TRAFFICKING FENTANYL WE SHOULD NOT BE SURPRISED NEXT YEAR OR THE YEAR AFTER WHEN THE NUMBERS CONTINUE TO DOUBLE. CALIFORNIANS ARE DYING AT AN EXPONENTIAL RATE THAT'S GOING THROUGH THE ROOF. AND I BELIEVE THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS TO RISK A LOT TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT. HALF SB SEVEN FIVE LET'S SEE THAT WILL DO TO. AT THE STOP GAP. FOR THE DRUG TRAFFICKING CPAS. TO FETCH UP FROM SOUTH OF THE BORDER. THANK YOU. SENATOR HOME WITH WHAT I. IN OF A OF TWO OF- EXAMPLES YOU BROUGHT FOR MIKE IS THAT FAN WITH WITH HEROIN OR COCAINE YOU DO HAVE A SENSE LIKE KIND OF A SOME OF THAT SO THAT THE DOES RAISE UP SO IF YOU LESS TEN. OF THE OF FAT AND OR FAT NOW FOR A ONE YARD THERE THEY'RE THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY TO A LONGER YOU KNOW NOT IN CARSON. OF I THINK THE CONCERN THAT'S GROWING GROWING IS THAT THIS WAS PURE FENTANYL THAT'S COMING IN AND- YOU KNOW HUGE QUANTITIES AND OF COURSE IF THAT AVAILABLE THEN THEY'RE GOING TO LACE IT INTO THESE OTHER DRUGS THAT THEY'RE GOING LAY FINANCIAL OR USUALLY THE OPIOIDS. NOW FOR KIDS ARE GETTING IT THEY'RE NOT GETTING IT FROM HEROIN AND COCAINE ARE GETTING IT FROM OXYCONTIN FOR ONE OF THOSE SO THOSE ARE THE ISSUES I THINK THAT REALLY THE BILL NEEDS TO FOCUS ON- I AM TOTALLY WILL FOR YOU ALL THE EVIDENCE. MONTHS DO NOT THE PLANT- TRUE- TREATMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH OR ADDICTION A FEDERAL ABSOLUTELY THERE BUT THERE'S A PLACE FOR SENTIMENT HELL SPENCER WOULD HAVE BEEN THERE FOR HEROIN AND COCAINE IF IT WASN'T WORKING FOR THOSE LIQUID LIQUID FENTANYL DOING NOW IT'S MAKING NORTH. SECONDARY DRUGS AND YOU KNOW AND- IT'S BECOME THE DRUG OF CHOICE BECAUSE THEY GET YOUR HIGH FASTER BUT IF NIKI THE WAY OF COMING IN AND AFFECTING OUR YOUNGER POPULATION AND THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY ADDICTED AND NEED TO GET HIGHER AND HIGHER AND THESE FELLOWS WHO ARE- TELLS ME THEY KNOW. I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE A BARNES MADE A REALLY GREAT POINT AT A PANEL I PARTICIPATED IN ABOUT A MONTH AGO THAT UNTIL WE STOP THE DEMAND WE'RE NOT GOING TO STOP THE IMPORTATION OF THE PRODUCTION BECAUSE IT FULL. OF BLUE GRILL BUT IF WE START WITH SOMETHING THAT BOTH. USE YOUR BRAIN THOUGHT IN PURELY ONE KILO IS TWO POUNDS YOU KNOW FIVE KILO TEN POUNDS AND ON AND ON AND I THOUGHT COMING IN WE'RE NOT COMING IN A LITTLE PLASTIC BAG BECAUSE THEY'RE DISTRIBUTING ON THE STREET. SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO REIN IN I I'M OPEN TO US CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION. OR MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO START WITH THIS BILL UP WITH. IN THE FINANCE. MAYBE WE SAW. THE SEVEN HEY MONTHS FOR COCAINE AND HEROIN. TAKE THOSE OUT PUT HIM ON THERE FOR FAT. DO WE IF WHICH AN OUTER MAYBE SHOULD BE A- PRO THAT DOES SOMETHING. TO TRY TO GET TO WHAT SENATOR. WITH SAYING THAT BEEN ABLE TO DO PORTUGAL. WELL WE'RE ALL LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER- THIS. TO DO. HELP R. P. GET ALL. OF WHATEVER A GIFT PERSON. OF HOW THEY WERE GOT INTO A BIT ON THE OTHER FOR. WE HAVE LOTS OF. THOSE WHO. REALLY VERY INVOLVED IN MAKING MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS- BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A WAY TO FOCUS ON THEM AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND WE KNOW THAT THEY KNOW THEY'VE GOT A FAST TRACK AN EASY STREET TO GET THAT STUFF IN HERE. AND THEN GIVE IT TO THE PEOPLE THAT PUT IT IN THESE OTHER OTHER DRUGS. SO THAT'S WHY I KEEP BRINGING IT BACK. IN I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE AN ONGOING DIFFER. AND I'D LOVE TO HAVE YOUR I. VOTE TODAY. I DON'T SEE THAT IT'S NECESSARILY THERE. BUT I KNOW THAT YOUR HEART THROUGH THERE AND I THINK YOUR COMMITMENT TO TRY TO. MAKE THIS SOMETHING THAT WE CAN BE PROUD OF IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS THAT WE RAN THE WHOLE THING YEAH. IT WOULD BE A BOON ON TO OUR STATE. MAYBE WE COULD BE THE LEADER IN THERE BECAUSE IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT PLAGUING. OUR NATION. SO WITH THAT I ASKED YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU SOONER COMMA. THANK YOU SENATOR I DO WANTED TO RESPOND BECAUSE I PULLED THE UP THE- ACTUALLY THE PERSON WHO GOT THIRTY THREE YEAR. HELLO WAS WAS WAS WAS. THEY WERE CONVICTED BECAUSE THEY GAVE SOMEONE ONE DOES. AND THEN THE PERSON WHO GOT LIFE- HAD- A LESS THAN A KILO. SO I SAY THAT BECAUSE IT'S THERE'S A LOT OF DISCREPANCY AND- VARIANCE IN HOW FOLKS ARE BEING CHARGED BUT I THINK IT DOES GO TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE TOOLS THAT ARE OUT THERE. AND I THINK THE FOLKS WHO ARE ON THE STREET WHO ARE SELLING IN- INCONSEQUENTIAL TO THE LARGER PROBLEM WHICH ARE THE CARTELS AND JUST THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT CAN BE. MADE SELLING THIS AND SO HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GO TO THE HEART OF IT BECAUSE IF YOU TAKE YOU KNOW A-% PERSON A OFFICE. PERSON B. OR C. OR D. ARE RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. AS LONG AS THERE ARE ABLE TO. AS LONG AS PROFITS ARE ABLE TO BE MADE. AND IT IS CHEAP LIKE WHACK A MOLE AND I THINK WE OWE IT TO THE STATE AND THE FOLKS WHO ARE COMING IN CONTACT WITH THE DRUG FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET TO THE HEART OF IT BUT IT SEEMS LIKE BECAUSE THERE ARE FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN PROSECUTED AND CHARGED AND SENTENCED. THAT PROSECUTORS ARE FINDING TOOLS TOGETHER WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT ANOTHER WAY TO ATTACK THE PROBLEM- BUT I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DISCREPANCY WITH REGARDS TO HOW MUCH OF THE FENTANYL WAS IN THE POSSESSION OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CHARGED AND THEN FENTON. SO I JUST WANT TO RAISE THAT BECAUSE I. AND I DON'T WANT A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH BUT I'M JUST SHARING THIS BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW. THAT THIS IS I MEAN I CARE ABOUT THIS TOO. AND I WANT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET TO THE HEART OF WHAT THE THING IS- SO. I WE LOOK AT IT IS THAT YOU KNOW THE POISON WE HAVE RAT POISON AFFECTING OUR- YOU KNOW OF MELAMINE POPULATION WE IMMEDIATELY JUMP TO THIS IS POISON THAT'S AFFECTING OUR PEOPLE. WE'VE GOT TO FIND AN ANSWER WE WOULDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM- PASSING BILLS THAT STOP POISONOUS POISONING OUR FOOD POISONING OUR CROPS. PLEASING OUR ANIMALS LIVE WITH POLICE IN OUR PEOPLE AND I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IT THAT WAY AND- KIND OF GO DOWN THAT PATH. AND KIND OF GET IT OUT OF THE- PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE. AND ON CUE IT IS A SUBSTANCE THAT REALLY NEEDS TO NOT. TO NOT BE ABLE TO BE PRODUCED AND TRAFFIC DOWN NOW BROUGHT IN HERE AND TRUCKLOAD FULL. WITHOUT I'LL BE BACK TO YOU GUYS I KNOW YOU ALL WANT TO FIND AN ANSWER. AND I WANT TO BE PART OF THAT WITH YOU COOL THANK YOU WE HAVE CENTER- CHEWABLE. THANK YOU MISS CHAIRMAN VERSE. THANK YOU FOR THE PROPERTY TO SPEAK. I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO THE OPERATR FOR HER TIRELESS EFFORTS ON THIS IMPORTANT NOW IN THE COMMENTS THAT MY COLLEAGUES ARE CHEERING ON THE SCIENCE. AS WELL NOW THE PENDULUM HAS BEEN MANAGING THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION IN RECENT YEARS. THIS IS THIS YOUR HOME IN S. T. AT THREE. ARE THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN THAT'S AN OLD RELATED DEATHS IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY IN TWENTY TWENTY WELL. AND IN RECENT MONTHS 50% OF ALL OVERDOSE DEATHS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO SENTINEL. AS MENTIONED EARLIER. THERE WAS A RISE OF 656% THAT'S EXAMINE YOUR PARENTS. AT I THINK OKAY THANK YOU FOR. TO BE FIFTY MORE THAN. AND YOU DON'T- OVERDOSE OCCUR AND AMERICA FOUND OF. I THE USER DRUGS HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE. NO KNOWLEDGE THAT THE DRUGS THERE CONSUMING CONTAIN THE OF. THE PARTS HAVE LOST MY OR HIS. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS DEADLY DRUG FENTANYL INVOLVED ON THE LIST. THESE ARE THIS WOULD NOT TARGET SUBSTANCE ABUSERS. OR EVEN INDIVIDUALS GENERALLY SELLING DRUGS AS THE QUANTITY SO LARGE THAT IT WOULD ONLY APPLY TO INDIVIDUALS TRANSPORTING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF PRODUCT FOR DISTRIBUTION. AND IT GOES THAT- IF ALL ELSE IS WOULD BE JUST A SMALL STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TOWARDS ADDRESSING THE EPIDEMIC AND EVEN MORE SO IT'S NOT A RIGHT DIRECTION WORK OUT IN YOUR INBOX BUT PERHAPS THE STATEMENT BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE TO SAY. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. AND I'M NOT MOTION NINE HUDSON'S. IS THAT WHAT YOUR PROFITS. THANK YOU. AND SIR ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION DEBATE BY COLLEGE HERE IN CHINA I TOO JUST WANNA- STATE MY APPRECIATION FOR YOUR COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE AND- BY NO MEANS WANT TO DIMINISH THE EFFORT THAT YOU HAVE MADE. OVER THE YEARS TO BRING THIS TO AN END- COOL NOT ONLY THE LEGISLATORS ATTENTION BUT CALIFORNIA INTONATION AS WELL BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DYING FROM THIS BUT AGAIN HAS CLEARLY BEEN DEMONSTRATED OVER THE LAST FORTY YEARS ON THE WAR ON DRUGS ENHANCEMENTS DO NOT. DETER INDIVIDUALS FROM DOING CRIMINAL ACTIVITY REGARDS OR WHAT IS WE'VE JUST SEEN THAT FROM TIME AND TIME AGAIN. AND I THINK ESR CALM WATER WHICH- REFERENCING AS WE SAW FORTY YEARS AGO WITH THE CRACK. EPIDEMIC THE CARTELS WERE VERY RARELY IMPACTED IT WAS ALWAYS THE FRONTLINES. STREET SELLER WHO HAD A GRAMMAR TO MAYBE AN OUNCE AND THEY WERE THE ONES IN SUMMER PRICE STILL IMPRISONED TODAY- BUT THE CARTELS HAVE MOVED ON FROM COCAINE NOW TO FENTANYL AND- TRUE ENOUGH WE NEED TO STOP THE MANUFACTURING DAY. IMPORTING WITH THE TRAFFICKING IN THIS DEADLY DISEASE I MEAN DEADLY DRUG BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR- ADDICTION IS A DISEASE TOO AND I JUST WISH WE COULD. FIND A WAY TO. HAVE A MORE HEALTH CENTERED APPROACH TO HELPING THOSE INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE AGAIN THE MAJORITY OF THOSE FIT FOLKS ARE DYING FROM THIS ONE ON ONE WITH A SINGLE LIFE BUT THE MAJORITY ARE NOT. BINDING FROM FRONTLINE COURT CARTEL SELLERS THERE'S- THEIR FRIENDS. IN SCHOOL MATES AND- JERRY DRUGS AMONGST EACH OTHER IN A PARTY ENVIRONMENT AND GETTING BAD DRUGS UNBEKNOWNST TO THEM AND UNFORTUNATELY LOSING% THEIR LIVES SO. I'M JUST WARNING AS TO WHAT'S BEST TO DO HERE WE OFFERED UP SOME AMENDMENTS RECOMMENDING. ME INTO SUCH A SEPARATE STATUTE- DEALING WITH MENTAL AND WHAT WERE YOU ON CONSIDERING THAT AND JUST. DEALING WITH IT AND CLEARLY AS IT RELATES TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED HERE TO TRAFFICKING- IMPORT IMPORTING AND TRANSPORTATION AND SELLING OUT- DRUG. WELL WE DO NOT HAVE A COPY OF ANYTHING IT CAME DESCRIBING THE NEMESIS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY DIDN'T GERMAN RAPPER BUT WE HAD- THE TOTAL- COLVIN IN FACT INFESTATION IN OUR OFFICE SO POSSIBLY. WE MISS THAT INFORMATION. SO IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE OUR DISCUSSION ON THE BILL AND HAVE IT. YOU WORK IN PROGRESS I WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE VERY OPEN TO THAT. AN IONIZER I STAND CORRECTED WE DID NOT OFFER A MULTI YEAR SO IT'S BEEN A DISCUSSION SO- I MISSPOKE THERE BUT- THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT POSSIBLE AMENDMENTS THAT COULD. MAKE THIS- MORE ACCEPTABLE TO- MEMBERS HERE ON THIS COMMITTEE BUT IMPORTANT HEPS WE CAN START THERE AND WITH THAT DISCUSSION AND THEN IT'S A NEW IT'S A NEW YEAR AND I'LL BE TALKING TO SENATOR COM LAGER AND- SENATOR SKINNER AND SENATOR WIENER AND HAVE SOME CONVERSATION MAYBE THEY CAN GIVE SOME IDEAS TO LOOK LIKE.
