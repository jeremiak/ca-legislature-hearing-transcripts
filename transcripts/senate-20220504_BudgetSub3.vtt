00:21:42.334 --> 00:21:43.702
IMMEDIATELY LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH.

00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:45.871
RIGHT SO THERE IS SAID SAID IT

00:21:45.937 --> 00:21:48.240
IS CAN THIS SEAMLESS. BETWEEN

00:21:48.306 --> 00:21:49.107
LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND STATE

00:21:49.174 --> 00:21:50.609
PUBLIC HEALTH I REALIZE YOU ALSO

00:21:50.676 --> 00:21:53.211
HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH CDC AND

00:21:53.278 --> 00:21:55.247
NATIONAL BUT AT LEAST WITH IT.

00:21:55.313 --> 00:21:59.184
SHOULD WE- INFORMATION IDEALLY-

00:21:59.251 --> 00:22:00.252
BUILD THE MOVE SEAMLESSLY

00:22:00.318 --> 00:22:03.155
BETWEEN LOCAL AND STATE PUBLIC

00:22:03.221 --> 00:22:06.358
HEALTH IS THAT IS THAT YOU DO

00:22:06.425 --> 00:22:07.526
AGREE WITH THAT. YES OKAY SO

00:22:07.592 --> 00:22:09.161
RIGHT SO KNOWS WE HAVE TO SET IT

00:22:09.227 --> 00:22:11.530
STAND SO AS YOU'RE DEVELOPING

00:22:11.596 --> 00:22:12.364
THIS WE NEED TO SET IT

00:22:12.431 --> 00:22:14.132
STANDARDS. WE MAY ALSO NEED TO

00:22:14.199 --> 00:22:15.267
HOPEFULLY YOUR PLANE YOU'RE

00:22:15.333 --> 00:22:19.004
THINKING ABOUT. TRAININGS ALSO-

00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:20.305
FOR SMALLER COUNTIES PERHAPS

00:22:20.372 --> 00:22:23.275
ALSO FUNDING SO THAT THEY CAN BE

00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:24.242
SURE THAT THEIR SYSTEM SO YOU'RE

00:22:24.309 --> 00:22:25.410
NOT TRYING TO CONSTANTLY.

00:22:25.477 --> 00:22:26.945
CONNECT WITH THE LEGACY SYSTEM

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:28.680
RIGHT THAT WE ACTUALLY GET

00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:30.482
EVERY. SINGLE OF LOCAL PUBLIC

00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:32.084
ARE MADE UP TO A CERTAIN MINIMUM

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.252
STANDARDS AS WELL. IS THAT

00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:36.154
SOMETHING YOU ENVISION. YES ALL

00:22:36.221 --> 00:22:38.090
RIGHT THANK YOU- AND THEN THE

00:22:38.156 --> 00:22:41.193
OTHER ISSUE IS THAT- YOU KNOW

00:22:41.259 --> 00:22:42.594
OBVIOUSLY PUBLIC HEALTH DOESN'T

00:22:42.661 --> 00:22:44.529
STAND IN THE SILO ALONE. AND I

00:22:44.596 --> 00:22:46.164
THINK IT BROUGHT THIS UP BEFORE

00:22:46.231 --> 00:22:47.566
YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE WE ARE

00:22:47.632 --> 00:22:49.434
LATER ON WE'LL BE TALKING TO THE

00:22:49.501 --> 00:22:50.969
H. CHI HER RIGHT AND- THEY THEY-

00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:52.637
THEY'RE SETTING UP THINGS LIKE-

00:22:52.704 --> 00:22:54.873
ALL CLAIMS PAYER DATABASES AND-

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.109
HEALTH EXCHANGES AND SO FORTH.

00:22:57.175 --> 00:23:00.045
IDEA AND VISION YOUR- YOUR AYE

00:23:00.112 --> 00:23:02.047
IT TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM ACTUALLY

00:23:02.114 --> 00:23:03.115
IT THING WITH THOSE TYPES OF

00:23:03.181 --> 00:23:05.150
DATA SAID. YOU CAN EXTRACT

00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:07.953
PUBLIC HEALTH DATA OUT OF THIS

00:23:08.019 --> 00:23:10.055
DATA SETS. THAT WOULD BE THE

00:23:10.122 --> 00:23:11.056
ULTIMATE CALL OKAY ALL RIGHT SO

00:23:11.123 --> 00:23:12.524
THAT THE REALLY IMPORTANT TO

00:23:12.591 --> 00:23:15.260
WRITE BECAUSE AGAIN- HOW THINGS

00:23:15.327 --> 00:23:16.394
GET INTO THE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:23:16.461 --> 00:23:17.596
SYSTEM OFTENTIMES ARE TAKING

00:23:17.662 --> 00:23:19.164
REPORTING FROM HOSPITALS

00:23:19.231 --> 00:23:20.866
PHYSICIANS OFFICES LABORATORIES

00:23:20.932 --> 00:23:23.001
AND SO FORTH. RIGHT AND YOU AND

00:23:23.068 --> 00:23:23.935
YOU WANT THAT INFORMATION BE

00:23:24.002 --> 00:23:25.437
ABLE TO MOVE QUICKLY AND THAT

00:23:25.504 --> 00:23:27.973
SOMEONE'S FAXING INFORMATION

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:28.940
THAT SOMEONE THEN HAS TO

00:23:29.007 --> 00:23:30.709
MANUALLY ENTER. RIGHT IT TAKES.

00:23:30.776 --> 00:23:32.544
YOU DON'T WORK FOR IT SAID SAID

00:23:32.611 --> 00:23:36.381
DELAYS- ETCETERA- SO I THINK

00:23:36.448 --> 00:23:38.450
THAT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT

00:23:38.517 --> 00:23:39.317
THAT AND ACTUALLY I GUESS THE

00:23:39.384 --> 00:23:40.552
QUESTION IS MAYBE THIS IS

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:42.020
BROUGHT IN JUST A PUBLIC HEALTH

00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:43.989
BUT THAT MAY BE A QUESTION FOR

00:23:44.055 --> 00:23:45.857
FINANCE WHO ARE WE LOOKING AT

00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:46.892
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE WHEN IT

00:23:46.958 --> 00:23:49.227
COMES TO. YOU KNOW IT TO YOU

00:23:49.294 --> 00:23:50.729
THIS IS CROSS DEPARTMENTS THAT

00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:51.730
AND I'VE I'VE ALWAYS SUGGESTED

00:23:51.797 --> 00:23:53.932
IS THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE THAT IS

00:23:53.999 --> 00:23:55.133
WE'RE DEVELOPING SOME THESE

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.536
OTHER IT SYSTEMS THAT INTERSECT

00:23:57.602 --> 00:23:59.004
WITH PUBLIC HEALTH THAT THERE

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:00.772
NEEDS TO BE SOME FORM OF.

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:02.207
COMPATIBILITY SO THAT

00:24:02.274 --> 00:24:04.176
INFORMATION CAN AGAIN FLOW MORE

00:24:04.242 --> 00:24:07.012
SEAMLESSLY BETWEEN THESE OTHER

00:24:07.078 --> 00:24:08.580
HEALTH SYSTEMS HEALTH DATABASES

00:24:08.647 --> 00:24:10.749
AND- POLICE FOR THE PUBLIC

00:24:10.816 --> 00:24:15.053
HEALTH NURSES. YES THIS IS ADAM

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.988
DANDO AGENCY CHIEF INFORMATION

00:24:17.055 --> 00:24:20.325
OFFICER S. S. G. WESTERN DR PADA

00:24:20.392 --> 00:24:22.661
TODAY AND WE DID TALK ABOUT THIS

00:24:22.727 --> 00:24:23.995
LAST WEEK WITH THE PROPOSAL FOR

00:24:24.062 --> 00:24:25.163
MY OFFICE AND I'M WITH THE

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:26.965
OFFICE OF SYSTEMS INTEGRATION

00:24:27.032 --> 00:24:28.300
WILL BE DOING EXACTLY THAT WE

00:24:28.366 --> 00:24:32.337
pAND LOOKING AT THE STANDARDS AND

00:24:32.404 --> 00:24:33.939
INTEROPERABLE WITH THE IN THE

00:24:34.005 --> 00:24:35.440
NEED TO BE ABLE TO. HAVE THIS

00:24:35.507 --> 00:24:36.942
ENTERPRISE PERSPECTIVE ACROSS

00:24:37.008 --> 00:24:38.476
ALL OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

00:24:38.543 --> 00:24:41.213
AGENCY AND EVEN INTERACTING

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:43.415
OUTSIDE THE AGENCY ACROSS THE

00:24:43.481 --> 00:24:44.282
STATE AS WELL. I'M REALLY TO

00:24:44.349 --> 00:24:47.252
HEAR. BECAUSE AGAIN WITH THIS IS

00:24:47.319 --> 00:24:48.887
ONE OF THINGS WE LEARNED

00:24:48.954 --> 00:24:49.487
PANDEMIC WAS THAT INFORMATION

00:24:49.554 --> 00:24:50.889
COULDN'T FLOW QUICKLY AND OF

00:24:50.956 --> 00:24:51.923
COURSE THAT CAUSES GAPS IN

00:24:51.990 --> 00:24:54.326
INFORMATION. THE LASER REPORTING

00:24:54.392 --> 00:24:55.193
WHICH MEANS THAT LAYS AND BE

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:58.296
ABLE TO RESPOND- AND SO FORTH

00:24:58.363 --> 00:25:01.333
AND- ALSO WE GET A FRANKLY.

00:25:01.399 --> 00:25:03.201
HUESO SPREAD OUT THE RIGHT WORD

00:25:03.268 --> 00:25:05.070
BUT IN SOME WAYS IT WAS- OF THE

00:25:05.136 --> 00:25:06.938
WORK FORCE REGULARS SO BUSINESS

00:25:07.005 --> 00:25:08.607
NO THEY NEED TO DO THINGS LIKE

00:25:08.673 --> 00:25:09.875
IMPLEMENT PUBLIC HEALTH ORDER

00:25:09.941 --> 00:25:11.176
AND SO FORTH YET THEY ARE DOING

00:25:11.243 --> 00:25:13.311
DATA ENTRY. YOU KNOW MANUAL DATA

00:25:13.378 --> 00:25:14.246
ENTRY BECAUSE THERE WITH THAT

00:25:14.312 --> 00:25:16.281
BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ONLY WAY TO

00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:17.249
GET THE DATA ACROSS AND OF

00:25:17.315 --> 00:25:19.084
COURSE WE STRUGGLE WITH THAT-

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.019
IT. SO THE I GUESS THE OTHER

00:25:21.086 --> 00:25:23.021
THING IS THAT AGAIN I CERTAINLY

00:25:23.088 --> 00:25:25.557
SUPPORT. MUCH OF WHAT- DAILY-

00:25:25.624 --> 00:25:29.194
SAID SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:25:29.261 --> 00:25:30.962
THAT WE FOLLOW THROUGH ON. WHAT

00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:32.597
DO YOU. AND I GUESS ONE OF THE

00:25:32.664 --> 00:25:34.099
THINGS AS- IN THIS DOCUMENT. AT

00:25:34.165 --> 00:25:35.300
LEAST IN THE BACKGROUND PEOPLE

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:37.068
WE GOT AND SO FORTH AND THEN

00:25:37.135 --> 00:25:39.070
REALIZE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE TO.

00:25:39.137 --> 00:25:40.105
WEAR BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE SO WE

00:25:40.171 --> 00:25:41.339
GOT NUMBERS RIGHT HOW MANY

00:25:41.406 --> 00:25:42.240
PEOPLE HOW MANY POSITIONS HOW

00:25:42.307 --> 00:25:44.376
MUCH MONEY AND SO FORTH. BUT I

00:25:44.442 --> 00:25:49.481
GUESS I HAVEN'T HEARD YET- IS.

00:25:49.547 --> 00:25:51.383
INDEED I REALIZE YOUR PRICE

00:25:51.449 --> 00:25:53.885
STILL FIGURING IT OUT BUT- IT IS

00:25:53.952 --> 00:25:56.187
REALLY KIND OF LIKE WHAT THE

00:25:56.254 --> 00:25:58.790
OVERALL IT STRATEGY IS SO I MEAN

00:25:58.857 --> 00:26:00.759
WE- WE KIND OF CHARACTERISTICS

00:26:00.825 --> 00:26:04.296
OF IT- BUT I'M HOPING THAT- YOU

00:26:04.362 --> 00:26:08.533
CAN HELP- PAINT A PICTURE FOR.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.368
US AND- LATER AND- FRANKLY WAS

00:26:10.435 --> 00:26:11.870
OBVIOUSLY WE NEED PUBLIC SUPPORT

00:26:11.937 --> 00:26:14.272
FOR THIS. OF WHAT WE SEE THIS

00:26:14.339 --> 00:26:16.841
FUTURE I. T. INFRASTRUCTURE

00:26:16.908 --> 00:26:17.542
FRAMEWORK IT'S WHAT EVERYONE

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:20.145
CALL THIS. IT IS EIGHT WHAT IT'S

00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:22.380
ABLE TO DO IN THE FUTURE- THAT

00:26:22.447 --> 00:26:24.516
AND ABOUT WHAT TIME ALL RIGHT

00:26:24.582 --> 00:26:26.451
WHAT THE TIMELINE IS TO GET

00:26:26.518 --> 00:26:28.186
THERE. AND SO MAYBE YOU'RE STILL

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:29.087
TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT YOU

00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:30.889
STILL- YOU KNOW COLLECTING

00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:32.724
INFORMATION OR GETTING FEEDBACK

00:26:32.791 --> 00:26:34.492
FROM FOLKS BUT I THINK THAT IT'S

00:26:34.559 --> 00:26:35.160
REALLY IMPORTANT SO IT'S GOT TO

00:26:35.226 --> 00:26:37.195
GO BEYOND THAT WE NEED DEL EX

00:26:37.262 --> 00:26:38.396
MORE TWENTY MILLION EIGHTEEN

00:26:38.463 --> 00:26:39.764
MILLION FIVE. YEAR THREE THREE

00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:41.099
POSITIONS AND SO FORTH. AND IN

00:26:41.166 --> 00:26:42.968
THE END SO PEOPLE CAN SAY OKAY

00:26:43.034 --> 00:26:44.235
THIS IS THE TYPE OF PUBLIC

00:26:44.302 --> 00:26:46.871
HEALTH SYSTEM. IT SYSTEM WE'RE

00:26:46.938 --> 00:26:49.040
GOING TO HAVE IN THIS IS GOING

00:26:49.107 --> 00:26:51.343
TO BE ITS CAPABILITIES- IN TERMS

00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:54.279
OF. FOR I THINK THE LEGISLATURE

00:26:54.346 --> 00:26:55.246
TO PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND LIKE

00:26:55.313 --> 00:26:56.381
THIS IS WHAT PUBLIC HEALTH IS

00:26:56.448 --> 00:27:00.051
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IN THE

00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:02.821
FUTURE DATA COULDN'T DO BEFORE.

00:27:02.887 --> 00:27:04.990
I THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT-

00:27:05.056 --> 00:27:07.759
SO. THE NEW. ALSO CAPACITY SO

00:27:07.826 --> 00:27:09.894
FORTH BUT REALLY PAINING VERY

00:27:09.961 --> 00:27:12.063
SOME- A FIVE UP THE IMPORTANCE

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:13.465
BUILDING A RIGHT IN WALLS OR AND

00:27:13.531 --> 00:27:15.467
THINGS- BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO

00:27:15.533 --> 00:27:17.402
IMPORTANT THAT WE BE ABLE TO

00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:19.237
COMMUNICATE THAT TO THE PUBLIC

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:21.072
AS WELL AND CONTINUE TO BUILD

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:22.107
BROADER PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR

00:27:22.173 --> 00:27:23.508
PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH

00:27:23.575 --> 00:27:24.042
UNFORTUNATELY DURING THE

00:27:24.109 --> 00:27:25.377
PANDEMIC HAS TAKEN QUITE A

00:27:25.443 --> 00:27:27.545
BEATING SO- IS THE D. WHAT AT

00:27:27.612 --> 00:27:29.547
WHAT TIME I GUESS I WOULD SAY

00:27:29.614 --> 00:27:30.749
WHAT AT WHAT TIME FRAME COULD

00:27:30.815 --> 00:27:34.285
WE- IMAGINE THAT- THAT THE

00:27:34.352 --> 00:27:37.989
WEATHER TO SEE. CDPH ARE. EVER

00:27:38.056 --> 00:27:40.892
CAN. PROVIDE US THAT KIND OF-

00:27:40.959 --> 00:27:44.396
PICTURE. OF WHAT YOU SEE IS THIS

00:27:44.462 --> 00:27:46.698
TWENTY FIRST CENTURY- PUBLIC

00:27:46.765 --> 00:27:50.235
HEALTH- I. T- TWENTY FIRST

00:27:50.301 --> 00:27:51.936
CENTURY PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM

00:27:52.003 --> 00:27:53.671
WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT SHOULD BE

00:27:53.738 --> 00:27:56.908
ABLE TO DO. YES NO THAT'S A VERY

00:27:56.975 --> 00:27:58.076
GOOD QUESTION AND WE ARE STILL

00:27:58.143 --> 00:27:59.344
TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

00:27:59.411 --> 00:28:01.112
ESTIMATES ARE THAT WITHIN A YEAR

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:03.281
TO YEAR AND A HALF WILL HAVE A

00:28:03.348 --> 00:28:05.050
PRETTY GOOD OVERTURE STRATEGY IN

00:28:05.116 --> 00:28:07.085
FORWARD WITH- AND AS FAR AS WHAT

00:28:07.152 --> 00:28:10.455
IT'S GONNA DO. A HIGH LEVEL. BUT

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.223
IT HE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:14.526
DATA SCIENCE AND INFORMATICS-

00:28:14.592 --> 00:28:16.461
WILL REALLY DEVELOP INVOLVING

00:28:16.528 --> 00:28:17.595
RESPONSIBLE MERGING DIGITAL

00:28:17.662 --> 00:28:20.832
TRANSFORMATION STRATEGIES- THAT

00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:21.699
DEFINES THE FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH

00:28:21.766 --> 00:28:24.936
TECHNOLOGY ECOSYSTEMS- AND

00:28:25.003 --> 00:28:26.871
ARCHITECTS THE INTEGRATION OF

00:28:26.938 --> 00:28:28.773
BETTER DATA PUBLIC THAT TO ME

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.509
PUBLIC HEALTH DECISIONS

00:28:31.576 --> 00:28:32.177
INTELLIGENCE. OPENNESS

00:28:32.243 --> 00:28:34.079
FRAMEWORKS ENABLE IMPROVEMENTS

00:28:34.145 --> 00:28:35.780
THAT DATA ACCESSIBILITY QUALITY

00:28:35.847 --> 00:28:38.349
AND COMPLIANCE. AND YOU KNOW

BE ABLE TO MODEL AND PREDICT.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.883

ADDITIONAL LEGAL LIABILITIES FOR

THERE WAS A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:14.123
THE LACK OF TRANSPARENCY

01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:15.190
OVERSIGHT IS FOR THE COMPOUNDED

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:17.126

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:37.012
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

WE'LL BE HAVING A LOT MORE

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:25.760

01:19:43.712 --> 01:19:44.312
IMPORTANT POINTS HERE- SO FIRST

01:19:44.379 --> 01:19:46.815

A BILL TO TALK ABOUT

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:53.421
IMPLEMENTATION SO I THINK THAT

01:19:53.488 --> 01:19:54.256
WORKS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH

01:19:54.322 --> 01:19:57.159

HAVE THIS CONTRACT SO FORTH BUT

01:20:17.612 --> 01:20:18.847
I THINK MORE ACCURATELY. BECAUSE

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:21.149
NOW MY ORIGINAL LEGISLATION

01:20:21.216 --> 01:20:23.084
WHICH WE REFER TO- YOU KNOW

01:20:23.151 --> 01:20:25.020
TALKED ABOUT THE STATE DURING

01:20:25.086 --> 01:20:26.188
THE MANUFACTURING ITSELF NOW.

01:20:26.254 --> 01:20:27.856
THE CHALLENGE THERE IS OF

01:20:27.923 --> 01:20:30.158
COURSE- OUR STATE DOESN'T HAVE

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:32.360
EXPERIENCE. DRUG MANUFACTURERS

01:20:32.427 --> 01:20:34.095

SO FORTH. AND SO THE STRATEGY

01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:45.340
NOW IS TO FIND A PARTNER. BUT I

01:20:45.407 --> 01:20:46.141
WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE WORD

01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:48.076
PARTNER OKAY AND THEN WHAT I

01:20:48.143 --> 01:20:50.545
MEAN BY THAT IS THAT. FROM MY

01:20:50.612 --> 01:20:51.112
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS

01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:52.380
PROPOSAL IS NOT SIMPLY A

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:54.683

01:21:00.055 --> 01:21:02.224
PARTNERSHIP IN FACT THE STATE

01:21:02.290 --> 01:21:03.458
WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE A GOVERNMENT

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:05.694
STAKE. IN EXCHANGE FOR PART OF

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:09.564

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:56.578
YEAR AGAIN OBVIOUSLY IS THAT THE

01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:58.013
THAT THE LEGISLATURE WERE

01:21:58.079 --> 01:21:59.681
DIFFERENT AS A DIFFERENT BRANCH

01:21:59.748 --> 01:22:00.415
OF GOVERNMENT I THINK SUPPORT

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:01.783
HAVE REPORTS AND SO FORTH. BUT

01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:04.152
THE STATE ITSELF AS A WHOLE IS

01:22:04.219 --> 01:22:06.021
AN ORGANIZATION ACTUALLY. WILL

01:22:06.087 --> 01:22:07.422
HELP MAKE INVESTMENT IT'S NOT

01:22:07.489 --> 01:22:09.257

INVESTMENTS- OF COURSE THIS

01:22:20.669 --> 01:22:22.837
FIRST WITH INSULIN BUT IS ALSO

01:22:22.904 --> 01:22:23.905
PRESENTED TO DEFY OTHER DRUGS

01:22:23.972 --> 01:22:26.441
WHERE. WE WOULD ACTUALLY AS AN

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:28.476
INVESTOR HAVE A SAY AS TO WHICH

01:22:28.543 --> 01:22:29.678

CALIFORNIA AND STEER THE

01:22:31.079 --> 01:22:34.883

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:45.560
OBVIOUSLY. YOU KNOW THE STATE'S

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:47.262
LEVERAGING STEERING THE

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:49.597
PROGRAMMER THIS THIS PROJECT ONE

01:22:49.664 --> 01:22:50.765
WAY OR ANOTHER WOULD BE RELATIVE

01:22:50.832 --> 01:22:52.100
TO THE TO THE SIZE OF THE

01:22:52.167 --> 01:22:54.803
INVESTMENT A SLIGHTLY SURE AND-

01:22:54.869 --> 01:22:56.471
AND OUR STAND. WELL WE'RE NOT

01:22:56.538 --> 01:22:57.972
LOOKING AT CONTROLLING STAKE

01:22:58.039 --> 01:23:00.008
WE'RE MAKING A SUBSTANTIAL

01:23:00.075 --> 01:23:01.042
INVESTMENT WOULD HAVE A

01:23:01.109 --> 01:23:06.748
SUBSTANTIAL SAY. THAT'S CORRECT

01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:09.851
OKAY. I DID I DID SO IT IS SO- I

01:23:09.918 --> 01:23:11.753
DO THINK THAT AGAIN WITH THE

01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:12.520
ORIGINAL VERSION OF THE STATE

01:23:12.587 --> 01:23:13.588
ACTUALLY MANY FACTIONS ON

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:15.323
ACTUALLY THIS IS THIS IS A

01:23:15.390 --> 01:23:16.891
LITTLE BIT OF A- HYBRID APPROACH

01:23:16.958 --> 01:23:18.259
BUT I MEAN THIS ISN'T ANYWAY.

01:23:18.326 --> 01:23:19.561
WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT WE'RE

01:23:19.627 --> 01:23:21.162
PARTNERING WITH AN ENTITY TO HAS

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:23.698
EXPERIENCE. RIGHT BECAUSE-

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:26.134
ALTHOUGH YOU KNOW WE NEED THAT

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:27.902
EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE RIGHT-

01:23:27.969 --> 01:23:29.904
WE CAN JUST GET THAT FROM

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:30.705
CONSULTANTS- WE HAVE ACTUALLY

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:32.107
OTHER INVESTORS THAT LEVERAGES

01:23:32.173 --> 01:23:35.076
OUR MONEY. RIGHT SO IT'S NOT

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:36.878
JUST CALIFORNIA. TRYING TO DO

01:23:36.945 --> 01:23:39.414
THIS ON BY OURSELVES. BUT WE'RE

01:23:39.481 --> 01:23:40.682
ALSO LEVERAGING OTHER INVESTORS

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:43.151
AND ALSO- THE POTENTIAL OF

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:45.353
COURSE OF- THE MARKET YOU'LL BE

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:46.921
ABLE TO LEVERAGE A LARGER MARKET

01:23:46.988 --> 01:23:48.056
RATE BECAUSE OTHER INVESTORS ARE

01:23:48.123 --> 01:23:49.524
NOT JUST INTO IN CALIFORNIA. I

01:23:49.591 --> 01:23:51.126
MEAN THIS IS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:53.628
MARKET THESE- THESE GENERIC

01:23:53.695 --> 01:23:54.529
MEDICATIONS STARTING WITH

01:23:54.596 --> 01:23:56.431
INSULIN- ACTUALLY ACROSS THE

01:23:56.498 --> 01:23:58.500
COUNTRY RIGHT- AND- AND OF

01:23:58.566 --> 01:24:01.202
COURSE WE FEEL. IN IN IN THE

01:24:01.269 --> 01:24:02.804
CONTRACT PART- WE'RE GONNA SET

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:04.973
GROUND RULES FOR THIS INVESTMENT

01:24:05.039 --> 01:24:06.608
RIGHT ENSURING THAT. YEAH THIS

01:24:06.674 --> 01:24:09.344
IS AT COSTS THAT YOU KNOW IT'S

01:24:09.411 --> 01:24:12.213
IT AND SO FORTH AND THAT- AND AT

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:14.249
THE CHIEF'S OF. BILLS THAT THAT

01:24:14.315 --> 01:24:20.088
WE SEE. IS THAT IS THAT CORRECT.

01:24:20.155 --> 01:24:22.524
THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY SO TO ME

01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:28.763
I'M CERTAINLY I.

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:30.799
NOW THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT-

01:24:30.865 --> 01:24:32.500
PERHAPS ALSO. SOMETHING THEY

01:24:32.567 --> 01:24:34.636
HAVEN'T DONE THAT PERHAPS NEED

01:24:34.702 --> 01:24:37.038
TO BE. MORE CLARIFIED TO THE

01:24:37.105 --> 01:24:40.208
LEGISLATURE- BUT BUT I ACTUALLY

01:24:40.275 --> 01:24:42.143
THINK. IN SOME WAYS- GIVEN THE

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:44.078
NATURE OF HOW WE'RE STRUCTURING

01:24:44.145 --> 01:24:45.513
THIS AND INVESTMENT AND

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.182
RECOGNIZING WE ARE WE ARE

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:50.752
VENTURING INTO. A THE DIFFERENCE

01:24:50.819 --> 01:24:52.854
IS THAT. IN TERMS OF- ACTUALLY

01:24:52.921 --> 01:24:57.692
BEING A L. PARTICIPANT AND THIS-

01:24:57.759 --> 01:24:59.127
VIED SAID KIND OF A DIFFERENT

01:24:59.194 --> 01:25:03.131
FORM OF OVERSIGHT. AS WELL THAT.

01:25:03.198 --> 01:25:04.098
WILL ACTUALLY BE BENEFICIAL TO

01:25:04.165 --> 01:25:05.967
THE STATE THAT IS ACTUALLY A

01:25:06.034 --> 01:25:07.469
LITTLE CLOSER TO THE VISION OF

01:25:07.535 --> 01:25:09.671
WHAT WE WANTED WHEN I AUTHORED

01:25:09.737 --> 01:25:11.306
PREVIOUS BILL AND THE GOVERNOR

01:25:11.372 --> 01:25:12.807
PROPOSED IN HIS BUDGET. THAT

01:25:12.874 --> 01:25:14.209
THIS REALLY IS A STEP IN THAT

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:16.945
DIRECTION IT'S NOT NOT MERELY-

01:25:17.011 --> 01:25:19.214
WELL WE- I JUST GOT A CONTRACT

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:21.316
THIS ALL OUT BUT ACTUALLY WE'RE

01:25:21.382 --> 01:25:22.383
PARTNERING WITH PEOPLE MAKING AN

01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:24.519
INVESTMENT TO AND ENSURING THAT

01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:26.754
WE'RE IN A POSITION AND ALL OF

01:25:26.821 --> 01:25:28.990
THIS. IN WHAT COMES OUT TO OF

01:25:29.057 --> 01:25:31.125
COURSE NOT ONLY DO INSULIN WHICH

01:25:31.192 --> 01:25:32.861
IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WILL WAS A

01:25:32.927 --> 01:25:34.829
PRIORITY- BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS

01:25:34.896 --> 01:25:38.833
OTHER- MEDICATIONS OR DRUGS-

01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:40.235
WHERE YOU KNOW THERE ARE MARKET

01:25:40.301 --> 01:25:42.270
FAILURES BUT TO ADD TO IT. BUT

01:25:42.337 --> 01:25:44.873
TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE-

01:25:44.939 --> 01:25:47.475
AFFORDABLE AND ALSO A RELIABLE

01:25:47.542 --> 01:25:50.044
SUPPLY OF MEDICATIONS FOR THE

01:25:50.111 --> 01:25:52.480
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO I

01:25:52.547 --> 01:25:54.215
THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:57.185
MOVING TOWARD- TO DO- CREATE THE

01:25:57.252 --> 01:25:58.753
WORK OF THE MINISTRATION- WE'VE

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:01.122
HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS- THEY'LL

01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:02.757
CERTAINLY APPRECIATE WHAT L. A.

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:04.192
O. SAID IN TERMS OF BEING YOU

01:26:04.259 --> 01:26:05.293
KNOW HAVING MORE INFORMATION

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:06.761
BEING SHARED WITH THE

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:07.395
LEGISLATURE ABOUT PERHAPS SOME

01:26:07.462 --> 01:26:09.130
OF THE DETAILS- NOW MILESTONES

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:11.332
AND SO FORTH ALSO READ

01:26:11.399 --> 01:26:12.400
RECOGNIZING THAT. NOW THIS IS-

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:14.035
IS SOMEWHAT CUT YOU KNOW AGAIN

01:26:14.102 --> 01:26:15.837
IT'S A COMPLEX MARKET THERE'S A

01:26:15.904 --> 01:26:16.971
LOT OF REGULATIONS THAT'S

01:26:17.038 --> 01:26:18.072
ACTUALLY THAT ACTUALLY WORKS IN

01:26:18.139 --> 01:26:20.141
OUR VANTAGE SOMEPLACE- MAY MAKE

01:26:20.208 --> 01:26:22.043
IT A LITTLE SLOWER THAN WE'D

01:26:22.110 --> 01:26:24.345
LIKE IT TO MOVE ALONG BECAUSE WE

01:26:24.412 --> 01:26:24.979
DON'T CONTROL THAT FTA OTHERS.

01:26:25.046 --> 01:26:26.915
OTHERS DO BUT BUT ALSO SHARES-

01:26:26.981 --> 01:26:28.216
THIS IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:29.584
LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY AND

01:26:29.651 --> 01:26:31.019
LET'S SAY TYPICAL CONTRACT WOULD

01:26:31.085 --> 01:26:33.154
SO I KNOW THAT SOME OF THESE TO

01:26:33.221 --> 01:26:35.189
GET A LITTLE NERVOUS WELL WHO'S

01:26:35.256 --> 01:26:36.090
WATCHING WHO'S WHO'S WATCHING

01:26:36.157 --> 01:26:36.958

BE MULTIPLE LAYERS OF OVERSIGHT.

01:26:39.694 --> 01:26:42.163
I THINK IN THIS PROPOSAL THAT-

01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:44.799
PERHAPS WOULDN'T EXIST AND SOME

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:45.400

THAT THERE ARE PATHWAYS. TO

02:05:00.492 --> 02:05:02.795

EXTRA SERVICE WE DO BELIEVE THAT

02:05:39.965 --> 02:05:41.834
SOME OF THAT IS AFFECTED BY. THE

SAME THINGS WE SEE ELSEWHERE IN

CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT

WORKFORCE ACCESS ISSUES- SO

02:05:47.873 --> 02:05:49.608
THERE ARE PATHWAYS TO HELP

02:05:49.675 --> 02:05:53.078
REDUCE THOSE BARRIERS- BUT THE

02:05:53.145 --> 02:05:55.614
CRUX OF. WHAT OUR FOR

02:05:55.681 --> 02:05:57.283
ORGANIZATIONS SOCIAL WORKERS

MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPIST

02:05:58.784 --> 02:06:01.086
CLINICAL CAST TALKING ABOUT. IS

02:06:01.153 --> 02:06:02.788
TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO

RETAIN THOSE TRAINEES SO THEY

02:06:14.733 --> 02:06:16.335
CAN WORK TWENTY THREE THOUSAND

02:06:16.402 --> 02:06:18.637
CLINICAL HOURS. WHILE ALSO BEING

02:06:18.704 --> 02:06:25.377
PAID TO DO SO WHICH. IN MOST

02:06:25.444 --> 02:06:27.479
CIRCUMSTANCES THEY ARE. WE'LL

02:06:27.546 --> 02:06:29.048
TALK ABOUT DOING THAT- PRE. OR

02:06:29.114 --> 02:06:32.384
POST. THAT WOULD BE POST SO-

02:06:32.451 --> 02:06:32.952
MICROTECH SPEAK MORE

02:06:33.018 --> 02:06:34.320
SPECIFICALLY TO CYCLE BECAUSE

I'M A DEBT I KNOW BACK WITH AND

02:06:37.222 --> 02:06:39.625
ASKED SEVENTY TWO ALSO SPEAK UP

02:06:39.692 --> 02:06:40.993
- MY FOLKS HAVE TO HAVE A

02:06:41.060 --> 02:06:43.095

THOUSAND HOURS OF CLINICAL WORK

02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:46.498
BEFORE THEY'RE ABLE TO ACHIEVE

02:06:46.565 --> 02:06:49.134
THEIR LICENSURE- AND DURING THAT

02:06:49.201 --> 02:06:50.202
TIME THEY HAVE TO BE DIRECTLY

02:06:50.269 --> 02:06:52.838
SUPERVISED. AND SINCE WE TALKED

02:06:52.905 --> 02:06:54.306
ABOUT THIS IN OTHER SETTINGS BUT

02:06:54.373 --> 02:06:56.108
BECAUSE THE PAY RATE FOR LICENSE

02:06:56.175 --> 02:06:58.410
CONDITIONS THAT MIGHT ACCOUNT IS

02:06:58.477 --> 02:07:00.245
A FAR LOWER THAN MANAGED CARE OR

02:07:00.312 --> 02:07:02.748
THE PRIVATE SECTOR- YOU'RE

02:07:02.815 --> 02:07:03.983
TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WHO NOT

02:07:04.049 --> 02:07:05.250
ONLY HAS TO BE DOING CLINICAL

02:07:05.317 --> 02:07:07.052
WORK IN THESE MEDICAL SETTINGS

02:07:07.119 --> 02:07:09.021
BUT ALSO. HAS TO PROVIDE SOME

02:07:09.088 --> 02:07:10.856
SUPERVISORY WORK AND THOSE

02:07:10.923 --> 02:07:13.292
TRAINEES TO WORK IN THE SETTINGS

02:07:13.359 --> 02:07:14.927
ARE OFTEN NOT PAID TO DO THAT.

02:07:14.994 --> 02:07:16.895
SO THEY ARE WORKING AT PAYING

02:07:16.962 --> 02:07:18.530
OFF STUDENT LOAN DEBT AT THE

02:07:18.597 --> 02:07:20.232
SAME TIME THE ALSO WILL BE TRUMP

02:07:20.299 --> 02:07:22.134
CLINICAL LIKE SH AND SO WHAT WE

02:07:22.201 --> 02:07:23.736
SEE IS REALLY IMPORTANT AS PART

02:07:23.802 --> 02:07:25.137
OF OUR ATKINS HEART OF THE

02:07:25.204 --> 02:07:28.073
LARGER FOCUS ASSETS DONE BY THAT

02:07:28.140 --> 02:07:29.641
COALITION THAT YOU MENTION. IS

02:07:29.708 --> 02:07:31.677
TRYING TO PROVIDE SOME DIRECT

02:07:31.744 --> 02:07:33.779
FINANCIAL RESULTS PARTICULARLY

02:07:33.846 --> 02:07:35.414
THE MEDICAL FACILITIES TO ALLOW

02:07:35.481 --> 02:07:37.182
THEM TO BRING THESE FOLKS ON SO

02:07:37.249 --> 02:07:39.351
THEY CAN ALSO SEE PATIENTS WHILE

02:07:39.418 --> 02:07:40.953
THEY'RE DOING THEIR TRAINING

02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:41.420
HOURS BUT THERE'S NO

02:07:41.487 --> 02:07:42.788
RELATIONSHIP NOW BETWEEN THE

02:07:42.855 --> 02:07:45.124
TRAINING AND NOT SO ELITE. WHICH

02:07:45.190 --> 02:07:47.092
MAKES THEM MORE LIKELY TO

02:07:47.159 --> 02:07:49.128
POTENTIALLY STAY ON THAT'S AFTER

02:07:49.194 --> 02:07:50.095
THEY'RE DONE WITH THE GLOBAL

02:07:50.162 --> 02:07:55.734

EXPERIENCE IS A ARE PAY DURING-

02:08:05.077 --> 02:08:06.178
DURING THAT TIME BECAUSE THERE

JUST WITH SOMEBODY ELSE. DOING

02:08:10.215 --> 02:08:11.316
THE SUPERVISION- BUT IT SOUNDS

02:08:11.383 --> 02:08:13.085
LIKE THAT'S NOT ALWAYS THE CASE

02:08:13.152 --> 02:08:14.153
IN A MEDICAL FACILITY IS THAT

02:08:14.219 --> 02:08:16.188
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. CORRECT

02:08:16.255 --> 02:08:17.689
THERE ARE SOME FACILITIES THAT

02:08:17.756 --> 02:08:20.592
DO. MAKE PAYMENTS BUT IT IS NOT

02:08:20.659 --> 02:08:22.995
A UNIFORM PRACTICE. AND THIS IS

02:08:23.062 --> 02:08:24.396
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

02:08:24.463 --> 02:08:26.865
GET AROUND WITH AT ONE TIME

02:08:26.932 --> 02:08:29.768

02:11:57.509 --> 02:11:58.644
HAVE IT'S PERHAPS MORE FOR THE

02:11:58.710 --> 02:11:59.711
ADMINISTRATION IS THAT. AGAIN

02:11:59.778 --> 02:12:01.413
REALLY APPRECIATE THE INVESTMENT

02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:02.681
TRADE AND WE'RE YOU KNOW WE TALK

02:12:02.748 --> 02:12:04.383
ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS AND SO

02:12:04.449 --> 02:12:05.217
FORTH. BUT WHEN YOU'RE RUNNING

02:12:05.284 --> 02:12:07.986
AN EDUCATION PROGRAM- AND- I

02:12:08.053 --> 02:12:09.154
THINK ALL THE EDUCATORS NO IS

02:12:09.221 --> 02:12:11.290
THAT. ONE TIME MONEY'S REALLY

02:12:11.356 --> 02:12:13.125
HARD TO WORK WITH. RIGHT BECAUSE

02:12:13.191 --> 02:12:15.694
YOU KNOW YOU HAVE STUDENTS YOU.

02:12:15.761 --> 02:12:17.996
ARE OUR TRAINEES I SHOULD SAY

02:12:18.063 --> 02:12:20.432
YOU KNOW- AND- AND THEN WHAT

02:12:20.499 --> 02:12:23.435
HAPPENS IS THAT- YOU HAVE THAT

02:12:23.502 --> 02:12:24.936
YOU HAVE TO FIND CLINICAL SITES

02:12:25.003 --> 02:12:26.738
YOU HAVE TO IDENTIFY PRECEPTORS

02:12:26.805 --> 02:12:28.740
RIGHT THE- WE TALKED ABOUT THE

02:12:28.807 --> 02:12:30.709
OVER THE MENTORS AND SO FORTH-

02:12:30.776 --> 02:12:32.010
YOU HAVE TO BUILD RELATIONSHIPS

02:12:32.077 --> 02:12:35.947
WITH FOLKS AND THEN THE OTHER

02:12:36.014 --> 02:12:37.115
THING AND THEN- AND IT OF COURSE

02:12:37.182 --> 02:12:39.651
TO TRAIN. ITSELF KNOWS TAKES

02:12:39.718 --> 02:12:41.353
SOME TIME. AND IN MANY WAYS

02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:42.921
ACTUALLY LEARNS EVEN LEARN FROM

02:12:42.988 --> 02:12:44.990
EACH OTHER SO SAMPLE AND MY

02:12:45.057 --> 02:12:46.325
RESIDENCY PROGRAM WOULD REALLY

02:12:46.391 --> 02:12:48.093
HARD TO JUST HAVE ONE CLASS OR A

02:12:48.160 --> 02:12:50.329
COUPLE CLASSES BE LARGER THAN.

02:12:50.395 --> 02:12:51.396
THE ONES THAT WERE BEFORE AND

02:12:51.463 --> 02:12:55.367
AFTER- AND SO FORTH SO. SO I

02:12:55.434 --> 02:12:57.736
GUESS THE A QUESTION I HAVE THE

02:12:57.803 --> 02:12:58.770
CERTAIN WE HAVE AN ACUTE NEED.

02:12:58.837 --> 02:13:01.707
THAT IS. YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS.

02:13:01.773 --> 02:13:03.909
WHAT IS THE THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND

02:13:03.975 --> 02:13:04.943
CERTAINLY SITTING ON BUDGET

02:13:05.010 --> 02:13:06.044
COMMITTEE KNOW THE YOU KNOW THE

02:13:06.111 --> 02:13:07.179
CHALLENGES A ONE TIME AND

02:13:07.245 --> 02:13:09.748
ONGOING AND SO FORTH AND THE

02:13:09.815 --> 02:13:10.816
VOLATILITY SOMETIMES IN OUR-

02:13:10.882 --> 02:13:13.685
OUR- REVENUES- BUT BUT HOW DO

02:13:13.752 --> 02:13:16.521
WORKING WITH- TRAINING PROGRAMS.

02:13:16.588 --> 02:13:18.290
TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY RAMP UP

02:13:18.357 --> 02:13:20.225
AND THEN- AND THEN ACTUALLY FOR

02:13:20.292 --> 02:13:22.160
DOING ONE TIME ARE ONE TIME OVER

02:13:22.227 --> 02:13:24.996
SEVERAL YEARS RAMP DOWN AGAIN-

02:13:25.063 --> 02:13:27.566
AND NOT AFFECT THE QUALITY OF

02:13:27.632 --> 02:13:29.201
THE EDUCATION- BECAUSE THAT'S

02:13:29.267 --> 02:13:31.002
CERTAINLY A STRUGGLE I'VE SEEN

02:13:31.069 --> 02:13:32.371
I'VE- ALWAYS HAD PROGRAMS LIKE

02:13:32.437 --> 02:13:34.339
THE ACA HAD A PROGRAM PROVIDED

02:13:34.406 --> 02:13:35.173
THEM ONE MORE PRIMARY CARE

02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:37.075
DOCTORS THE- BED. BECAUSE OF THE

02:13:37.142 --> 02:13:40.312
NATURE OF THE- FUNDING. IS SHORT

02:13:40.379 --> 02:13:42.114
TERM AND MANY PROGRAMS ACTUALLY.

02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:43.348
TURNED IT DOWN THEY WOULD EVEN

02:13:43.415 --> 02:13:45.751
TRY BECAUSE- PLYING BECAUSE THEY

02:13:45.817 --> 02:13:47.419
COULD NOT SEE HOW THAT WOULD.

02:13:47.486 --> 02:13:48.286
THAT THAT WOULD ACTUALLY

02:13:48.353 --> 02:13:49.688
NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE EDUCATION

02:13:49.755 --> 02:13:52.023
PROGRAM ITSELF TO TRY TO RAMP UP

02:13:52.090 --> 02:13:55.193
AND THEN LYING DOWN SO- SO WHAT

02:13:55.260 --> 02:13:55.927
WHAT KIND OF CONVERSATIONS ARE

02:13:55.994 --> 02:13:58.130
BEING HAD- WITH WITH WITH

02:13:58.196 --> 02:14:00.665
EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF.

02:14:00.732 --> 02:14:02.367
WHAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:14:02.434 --> 02:14:05.537
ACTUALLY SUS YELLED TO DO THE

02:14:05.604 --> 02:14:07.439
TRAINING AND TO CREATE THAT

02:14:07.506 --> 02:14:11.777
CAPACITY- TO ENSURE WE HAVE

02:14:11.843 --> 02:14:13.278
QUALIFIED YOU KNOW. THAT

02:14:13.345 --> 02:14:14.846
QUALIFIED THAT PEOPLE COMING

02:14:14.913 --> 02:14:15.447
THROUGH BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:14:15.514 --> 02:14:17.282
QUALIFIED BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY

02:14:17.349 --> 02:14:18.116
EDUCATION SO TO MAINTAIN THE

02:14:18.183 --> 02:14:23.221
LEVEL OF EDUCATION. QUALITY

02:14:23.288 --> 02:14:27.025
EDUCATION NECESSARY- SO. THAT WE

02:14:27.092 --> 02:14:28.593
RECOGNIZE THAT IS AN IMPORTANT

02:14:28.660 --> 02:14:30.195
ISSUE IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE

02:14:30.262 --> 02:14:32.531
SUSTAIN THE PROGRAMS THEMSELVES-

02:14:32.597 --> 02:14:34.166
AS WE'RE WORKING WITH THE

02:14:34.232 --> 02:14:37.002
TRAINING INSTITUTIONS TO- WE

02:14:37.068 --> 02:14:39.070
WANT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND- BUT

02:14:39.137 --> 02:14:40.505
WHAT THIS YOU KNOW NEEDS ARE TO

02:14:40.572 --> 02:14:43.475
SUSTAIN IT- AS WE AS- AS YOU'RE

02:14:43.542 --> 02:14:45.210
SAYING IS THEY BUILD UP THOSE

02:14:45.277 --> 02:14:48.780
PROGRAMS. AND SO WE CONTINUE TO.

02:14:48.847 --> 02:14:49.981
WORK WITH THEM TO UNDERSTAND

02:14:50.048 --> 02:14:53.652
THAT. OKAY SORRY- I APPRECIATE

02:14:53.718 --> 02:14:55.687
THE ANSWER ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE

02:14:55.754 --> 02:14:57.722
REALLY WASN'T ANSWERED- I MEAN

02:14:57.789 --> 02:14:59.157
AT SOME OF THESE THINGS FOR

02:14:59.224 --> 02:15:00.892
EXAMPLE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A TEN

02:15:00.959 --> 02:15:02.194
YEAR TIME FRAMES WHICH IS- BUT

02:15:02.260 --> 02:15:04.062
THEN THE OTHER ONES ARE LIKE

02:15:04.129 --> 02:15:06.064
THREE YEARS OR FIVE YEARS AND-

02:15:06.131 --> 02:15:07.866
AND DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF

02:15:07.933 --> 02:15:12.971
THE TRAINING- IT. IS I'M NOT

02:15:13.038 --> 02:15:15.474
SURE WHAT THE HOW TO USE IT

02:15:15.540 --> 02:15:19.177
RIGHT- IT IN A WAY THAT- SAYS

02:15:19.244 --> 02:15:22.113
FULLY SO- I THINK THESE ARE

02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:23.081
REALLY IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS

02:15:23.148 --> 02:15:24.049
BUT ALSO IT'S GOING TO BE

02:15:24.115 --> 02:15:26.518
IMPORTANT IS TO SHARE THEM WITH

02:15:26.585 --> 02:15:28.920
THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE WE HAVE

02:15:28.987 --> 02:15:31.089
TO YEAH WE DO BUDGETS EVERY YEAR

02:15:31.156 --> 02:15:32.123
AND SO FORTH- AND AS WERE

02:15:32.190 --> 02:15:33.458
CRAFTING OUT HOW YOUR-

02:15:33.525 --> 02:15:35.560
PROJECTIONS AND I GUESS THAT'S-

02:15:35.627 --> 02:15:37.829
THANK FOR FINANCE- THAT.

02:15:37.896 --> 02:15:38.563
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO WORK

02:15:38.630 --> 02:15:41.600
FORCE. IT'S REALLY HARD TO DO

02:15:41.666 --> 02:15:43.468
SHORT TERM THINGS THAT L.

02:15:43.535 --> 02:15:47.439
UNLESS- BECAUSE IT'S JUST. ME

02:15:47.506 --> 02:15:49.040
AND EDUCATION PROGRAM TAKES TIME

02:15:49.107 --> 02:15:51.009
TO DEVELOP IT'S NOT JUST SO YOU

02:15:51.076 --> 02:15:52.277
HAVE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE MAY WANNA

02:15:52.344 --> 02:15:55.247
FLY YOU CAN'T IT'S NOT. LIKE YOU

02:15:55.313 --> 02:15:57.415
CAN SUDDENLY EXPLODE THE NUMBER

02:15:57.482 --> 02:15:59.718
AND THEN DRINK IT AGAIN ALRIGHT

02:15:59.784 --> 02:16:03.922
IT'S- THAT AND SO- I THINK IT'S

02:16:03.989 --> 02:16:05.790
IMPORTANT WHEN WE PUT. DOWN

02:16:05.857 --> 02:16:06.992
THESE WORKFORCE PROPOSALS THAT

02:16:07.058 --> 02:16:09.828
WE REALLY YOU KNOW MAP OUT WHAT

02:16:09.895 --> 02:16:11.263
HAPPENS AND THEN WORK WITH

02:16:11.329 --> 02:16:13.231
EDUCATORS SAY WELL HOW G. FIFTY

02:16:13.298 --> 02:16:14.699
IS THAT IF. THIS TIME FRAME

02:16:14.766 --> 02:16:16.234
RIGHT. THREE YEAR TRAINING

02:16:16.301 --> 02:16:18.470
PROGRAM FOR YOU TO THE FUNDING

02:16:18.537 --> 02:16:20.539
ISN'T DEL IS GOING TO WORK FOR A

02:16:20.605 --> 02:16:21.907
WHILE RIGHT. CETERA I GUESS FOR

02:16:21.973 --> 02:16:24.509
THE PANEL. HOW MUCH OF AN ISSUE

02:16:24.576 --> 02:16:26.578
IS THIS FOR AND NOT I KNOW MANY

02:16:26.645 --> 02:16:28.413
STILL SEND SOME OF YOUR LEGIT

02:16:28.480 --> 02:16:29.447
ADVOCATES IN ACTUALLY THE

02:16:29.514 --> 02:16:31.016
TRAINEE ALL THE TRAINING PROGRAM

02:16:31.082 --> 02:16:34.119
DIRECTORS ITSELF BUT- IS THIS AN

02:16:34.185 --> 02:16:36.187
ISSUE FOR THAT YOU'RE HEARING

02:16:36.254 --> 02:16:41.426
FROM YOUR ASSOCIATIONS FROM. THE

02:16:41.493 --> 02:16:42.594
PEOPLE WHO RUN THE TRAINING

02:16:42.661 --> 02:16:45.430
PROGRAMS. YES GRANT CAN I SPEAK

02:16:45.497 --> 02:16:48.033
TO THAT A LITTLE BIT SO. ONE OF

02:16:48.099 --> 02:16:49.868
OUR SPECIAL DIVISION. IS ON

02:16:49.935 --> 02:16:52.103
EDUCATION. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF

02:16:52.170 --> 02:16:55.006
CLINICIANS WHO WORK- IN PRIVATE

02:16:55.073 --> 02:16:55.907
PRACTICE IN MANAGED CARE

02:16:55.974 --> 02:16:58.043
SETTINGS AND THE CAL SETTINGS

02:16:58.109 --> 02:17:00.011
AFTER IT LIKE SAY THE KIND OF.

02:17:00.078 --> 02:17:01.379
HEALTH FACILITIES AND SO THEY

02:17:01.446 --> 02:17:03.415
WERE TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THESE

02:17:03.481 --> 02:17:04.950
CHALLENGES WHERE- PARTICULARLY

02:17:05.016 --> 02:17:06.585
BECAUSE OF CERTAIN TRAINING

02:17:06.651 --> 02:17:08.920
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PSYCHOLOGY-

02:17:08.987 --> 02:17:10.455
THERE ARE CERTAIN. RESTRICTIONS

02:17:10.522 --> 02:17:12.223
REQUIREMENTS FOR TRAINEES WERE

02:17:12.290 --> 02:17:13.525
HAVING TO TRAVEL SOMETIMES AN

02:17:13.592 --> 02:17:16.294
HOUR TWO HOURS. AWAY TO SEE

02:17:16.361 --> 02:17:18.096
THEIR SUPERVISOR SO PART OF THAT

02:17:18.163 --> 02:17:20.098
WERE HOPING. AT LEAST THE LOW

02:17:20.165 --> 02:17:21.766
HANGING FRUIT IS KIND OF FIND

02:17:21.833 --> 02:17:23.435
OUT WHAT'S REVISIONS TO SOME OF

02:17:23.501 --> 02:17:25.236
THOSE CHALLENGES THERE. BUT THE

02:17:25.303 --> 02:17:27.272
OTHER PROBLEM WE'VE SEEN AS ONE-

02:17:27.339 --> 02:17:29.708
THAT- BACK ALLUDED TO AND

02:17:29.774 --> 02:17:31.242
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE IN THE

02:17:31.309 --> 02:17:35.847
STUDY PROGRAMS. WE'VE SEEN WITH

02:17:35.914 --> 02:17:37.115
US AS WELL AS- THERE'S A LIMITED

02:17:37.182 --> 02:17:40.719
OF ANY. WAS BOTH A PRIVATE AND

02:17:40.785 --> 02:17:42.787
PUBLIC NONPROFIT. ACTUALLY DOING

02:17:42.854 --> 02:17:44.155
THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING

02:17:44.222 --> 02:17:45.357
THAT'S NECESSARY TO MEET THE

02:17:45.423 --> 02:17:48.326
CLINICAL WORK FORCE- THERE ARE

02:17:48.393 --> 02:17:49.861
GREAT PARTNERS AT THE CALIFORNIA

02:17:49.928 --> 02:17:51.429
COMMUNITY COLLEGES YES YOU CAN

02:17:51.496 --> 02:17:53.164
CITIES. THAT COULD BE DOING MORE

02:17:53.231 --> 02:17:54.866
OF THIS WORK BUT WE ALSO ARE

02:17:54.933 --> 02:17:56.868
CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT. WITH

02:17:56.935 --> 02:17:58.336
THE INCREASE IN PUBLIC

02:17:58.403 --> 02:18:00.238
EDUCATION- SLOTS AS WE SEEM

02:18:00.305 --> 02:18:01.439
PARTICULAR BERKELEY THIS YEAR

02:18:01.506 --> 02:18:02.841
WITH SOME OF THE LAWSUIT

02:18:02.907 --> 02:18:03.908
HOUSING. YOU'RE ALSO TALKING

02:18:03.975 --> 02:18:05.477
ABOUT NECESSARILY TAKING SPOTS

02:18:05.543 --> 02:18:08.346
AWAY FROM PROGRAMS- BUT WE DO

02:18:08.413 --> 02:18:10.315
FEEL AS THOUGH THAT IS NECESSARY

02:18:10.382 --> 02:18:12.283
THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME.

02:18:12.350 --> 02:18:14.252
SERIOUS DISCUSSION WITH STRICTLY

02:18:14.319 --> 02:18:16.321
THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN

02:18:16.388 --> 02:18:18.423
TERMS OF EXPANDING. WHO IS BEING

02:18:18.490 --> 02:18:19.891
ABLE TO BE EDUCATED AND WHAT

PROGRAMS ARE IN PLACE BECAUSE

02:18:21.326 --> 02:18:22.627
THAT IS REALLY WHERE THE RUBBER

02:18:22.694 --> 02:18:24.929
MEETS ROAD. IT ALSO HAS THE BEST

02:18:24.996 --> 02:18:27.098
YOU GRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION- SO WE

02:18:27.165 --> 02:18:28.566
TALK ABOUT WORKFORCE IN CENTRAL

02:18:28.633 --> 02:18:30.268
VALLEY. THE HIGH DESERT THE

CENTRAL COAST THAT'S WHERE THE-

02:18:32.937 --> 02:18:35.073
COMMUNITY COLLEGE UC AND CSU

02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:36.107
SAYS. CAN REALLY BE A FORCE

02:18:36.174 --> 02:18:38.176
MULTIPLIER IN THE WAY THAT SOME

02:18:38.243 --> 02:18:40.745
OF OUR LARGE- PRIVATE PROPERTY

02:18:40.812 --> 02:18:42.380
GROUP BRANDON INSTITUTIONS JUST

02:18:42.447 --> 02:18:44.949
REALLY KICKED. IN OKAY THEN ONE

02:18:45.016 --> 02:18:47.085
OTHER QUESTION YES. I WAS

02:18:47.152 --> 02:18:49.287
WONDERING IF I COULD ALSO AT

EDUCATION TRAINING COUNCIL. THAT

02:18:55.660 --> 02:18:57.762
WOULD ESTABLISH IS REALLY ONE OF

02:18:57.829 --> 02:18:59.264
ITS REAL GOALS IS REALLY TO LOOK

02:18:59.330 --> 02:19:01.066
AT THOSE THINGS AND SO. ON THAT

02:19:01.132 --> 02:19:02.534

02:19:06.171 --> 02:19:07.639

REALLY HOPING THAT TOGETHER

02:19:12.644 --> 02:19:14.012
THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

02:19:14.079 --> 02:19:16.381
CAN LOOK AT IS AS WE AS WE BUILD

02:19:16.448 --> 02:19:17.716
OUT. YOU KNOW THE WORKFORCE

02:19:17.782 --> 02:19:19.684
EDUCATION TRAINING PROGRAMS AND

02:19:19.751 --> 02:19:22.120
CAPACITY FOR CALIFORNIA. OKAY

02:19:22.187 --> 02:19:30.695
AND- ALL RIGHT WELL. IN THAT I

02:19:30.762 --> 02:19:31.329
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

02:19:31.396 --> 02:19:32.230
COMMUNICATE. THE RESULTS THOSE

02:19:32.297 --> 02:19:34.432
QUESTIONS WITH WITH US ETERNAL

02:19:34.499 --> 02:19:36.101
LIFE. OUT ALSO MAKING I MEAN I

02:19:36.167 --> 02:19:38.436
KNOW I KNOW THAT THE ARE SOME

02:19:38.503 --> 02:19:39.904
ROUGH TO THE- FUTURE OF CARE

02:19:39.971 --> 02:19:42.373
WORKS COMMISSION- YEAH. I'D KEEP

02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:43.975
IN MIND THAT THAT WAS THE PRE

02:19:44.042 --> 02:19:46.044
COVERT- THE L. AND ONE CHALLENGE

02:19:46.111 --> 02:19:48.847
WORK FOR. IN CHANGE AND SO FORTH

02:19:48.913 --> 02:19:50.281
. SO YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THE

02:19:50.348 --> 02:19:51.916
DEMAND FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH I

02:19:51.983 --> 02:19:56.721
THINK IS INCREASED- AND- SO- AND

02:19:56.788 --> 02:19:57.689
IT'S ALWAYS CHALLENGE WITH

02:19:57.756 --> 02:20:00.024
WORKFORCE REPORTS SISTER DONE

02:20:00.091 --> 02:20:01.726
REFLECTING THE TIMES STORE AT NO

02:20:01.793 --> 02:20:05.663
NOT REFLECTING. NECESSARILY THE

02:20:05.730 --> 02:20:07.899
- NOPE THE PRESENT- BECAUSE

02:20:07.966 --> 02:20:09.100
THINGS HAVE BEEN BERMAN HAS

02:20:09.167 --> 02:20:10.268
CHANGED BUT- WHEN THE OTHER

02:20:10.335 --> 02:20:12.270
GUESTS ISSUES IN TERMS OF-

02:20:12.337 --> 02:20:13.238
BEHAVIORAL WORK WORK FOR

02:20:13.304 --> 02:20:14.472
CERTAINLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:20:14.539 --> 02:20:16.508
TRAINING. IS ACTUALLY RETENTION

02:20:16.574 --> 02:20:19.144
RATE- SO WE OFTENTIMES WE TALK

02:20:19.210 --> 02:20:20.078
ABOUT WORKFORCE WE TALK ABOUT

02:20:20.145 --> 02:20:21.246
THE PIPELINE AND PEOPLE GOING

02:20:21.312 --> 02:20:23.281
THROUGH TRAINING BUT ALSO THE

02:20:23.348 --> 02:20:25.183
RETENTION AND GREAT SO WHAT ARE

02:20:25.250 --> 02:20:27.085
WE DOING TO BE SURE THE PEOPLE

02:20:27.152 --> 02:20:31.656
WHO WERE YOU TRAINED. ARE ARE-

02:20:31.723 --> 02:20:33.758
BEING SUPPORTED. RIGHT AND

02:20:33.825 --> 02:20:36.661
ANSWER RELATED TO THAT- IS THAT

02:20:36.728 --> 02:20:38.863
FOR EXAMPLE ARE THE TEACHERS WHO

02:20:38.930 --> 02:20:43.168
ARE TEACHING OUR FATE EDUCATION

02:20:43.234 --> 02:20:45.503
. AB ARE THEY BEING SUPPORTED IN

02:20:45.570 --> 02:20:47.305
A WAY THAT IT'S COMPETITIVE WITH

02:20:47.372 --> 02:20:49.073
THEM NOT TEACHING AND JUST

02:20:49.140 --> 02:20:50.675
SEEING PATIENTS AND HOW THAT

02:20:50.742 --> 02:20:52.443
COMPARED TO THE PEOPLE DECIDE TO

02:20:52.510 --> 02:20:53.411
THEN PURSUE OTHER CAREERS OR

02:20:53.478 --> 02:20:56.114
RETIRED OR SO FORTH. SO YOU'LL

02:20:56.181 --> 02:20:58.283
WE GOT WHEN WE LOOK AT THE WORK

02:20:58.349 --> 02:20:59.984
FORCE YES BUT NOT ONLY THE

02:21:00.051 --> 02:21:01.219

02:21:01.286 --> 02:21:03.321
PEOPLE ARE LEAVING TO AS WELL SO

02:21:03.388 --> 02:21:05.056
ARE- AND- GIVE AND I THINK

02:21:05.123 --> 02:21:08.193
PERHAPS. THEM THIS MAY BE AN

02:21:08.259 --> 02:21:09.928
ISSUE WITH THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH

02:21:09.994 --> 02:21:11.095
WORKFORCE THAT CERTAINLY WILL BE

02:21:11.162 --> 02:21:12.997
AN ISSUE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE

02:21:13.064 --> 02:21:14.532
HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE AS WELL

02:21:14.599 --> 02:21:16.000
BORDERS A- VERY HIGH LEVEL OF

02:21:16.067 --> 02:21:17.802
BURNOUTS AT PDS AND HE- THAT

02:21:17.869 --> 02:21:19.470
SUTTER- THAT'S GOING ON AND THE

02:21:19.537 --> 02:21:20.839
HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY- AS A

02:21:20.905 --> 02:21:22.974
RESULT OF PANDEMIC AND- FRANKLY

02:21:23.041 --> 02:21:25.910
THE REFUSAL OF MANY PEOPLE TO-

02:21:25.977 --> 02:21:28.446
IT HERE TO. PUBLIC HEALTH

02:21:28.513 --> 02:21:30.915
MEASURES STAT- AND THE

02:21:30.982 --> 02:21:32.417
CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS OF COURSE

02:21:32.483 --> 02:21:34.886
MORE STRAIN ON PEOPLE ON THE

02:21:34.953 --> 02:21:38.156
HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY- BUT ALSO

02:21:38.223 --> 02:21:39.290
STRAIN ON THE BEHAVIOR HEALTH

02:21:39.357 --> 02:21:40.358
COMMUNITIES WELL- I'D LIKE TO

02:21:40.425 --> 02:21:42.527
MAKE A COMMENT ON THAT REBEKAH

02:21:42.594 --> 02:21:43.161
GONZALEZ FLETCHER. ASSEMBLY IN

02:21:43.228 --> 02:21:46.497
CALIFORNIA AND AS YOU MAY GUESS.

02:21:46.564 --> 02:21:48.500
LOS SALARIES ONE OF THE PRIMARY

02:21:48.566 --> 02:21:50.101
REASONS PEOPLE LEAVE THE FIELD

02:21:50.168 --> 02:21:51.169
OF SOCIAL WORK AND I CAN'T

02:21:51.236 --> 02:21:53.304
STRESS THAT ENOUGH. AND WE HAVE

02:21:53.371 --> 02:21:54.606
TO ENSURE THAT COUNTIES ARE

02:21:54.672 --> 02:21:56.774
ADEQUATELY FUNDED AND ENSURE

02:21:56.841 --> 02:21:58.343
PRIVATE FUNDING FOR FOUNDATIONS

02:21:58.409 --> 02:22:00.879
REFLECT WORKFORCE PRIORITIES AND

02:22:00.945 --> 02:22:03.514
THEN ALSO BUILDING AND- BUILDING

02:22:03.581 --> 02:22:04.983
ORGANIZED ORGANIZATIONAL

02:22:05.049 --> 02:22:07.252
CAPACITY TO PRIORITIZE SOCIAL

02:22:07.318 --> 02:22:09.921
WORK SERVICES- BUT I ALSO WANT

02:22:09.988 --> 02:22:12.390
TO TALK ABOUT THE KIND OF

02:22:12.457 --> 02:22:13.057

02:22:13.124 --> 02:22:15.727
CHANGED SOCIAL WORK STAFF AGAIN.

02:22:15.793 --> 02:22:17.695
ONE OF THOSE IS THE FOUR PLUS

02:22:17.762 --> 02:22:21.466

BSW IN SOCIAL WORK AND GET THEIR

02:22:26.471 --> 02:22:29.474
MASTERS IN ONE YEAR AND WE HAVE

02:22:29.540 --> 02:22:31.809
