REQUIRES A MASTERS TO VIA IN

00:38:46.424 --> 00:38:48.759
COMPARISON TO OTHER-

00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:51.862
OCCUPATION- OF COMPARABLE ORDER

00:38:51.929 --> 00:38:54.865
IN EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS SO.

00:38:54.932 --> 00:38:58.736
IT IT IS IT- EACH QUARTER TO OR

00:38:58.803 --> 00:39:01.939
THE OCCUPATION PAY THIS A C. P.

00:39:02.006 --> 00:39:04.775
R. INCREASES A BASIC ANY OTHER

00:39:04.842 --> 00:39:06.977
IN OCCUPATION OR HALF OF SALARY

00:39:07.044 --> 00:39:10.181
INCREASE AT ON A WIDE THIS HAS

00:39:10.247 --> 00:39:11.782
NOT BEEN TAKING PLACE. IF YOU

00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:13.184
WANT I MEAN AT THE END GENERAL

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:15.286
SOCIAL WORKERS WITH THE AND A

00:39:15.352 --> 00:39:16.654
MASTER'S DEGREE MAKE MUCH LESS

00:39:16.721 --> 00:39:17.822
THAN OTHER PROFESSIONS WHERE

00:39:17.888 --> 00:39:18.756
YOU HAVE THAT LEVEL OF

00:39:18.823 --> 00:39:20.558
EDUCATION THEY GOING TO SOCIAL

00:39:20.624 --> 00:39:21.492
WORK BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HELP

00:39:21.559 --> 00:39:23.761
PEOPLE- THEY HAVE A DEEP DESIRE

00:39:23.828 --> 00:39:24.962
TO HELP THEIR COMMUNITIES AND

00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:25.696
THEY KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE

00:39:25.763 --> 00:39:27.231
SOME SACRIFICES BY CHOOSING

00:39:27.298 --> 00:39:28.799
THIS CAREER. BUT THIS

00:39:28.866 --> 00:39:30.568
PARTICULAR AREA OF SOCIAL WORK

00:39:30.634 --> 00:39:32.670
WORKING IN FF PHASE IS LOWER

00:39:32.737 --> 00:39:34.572
COMPARED TO EIGHTY EVEN THE

OTHER PLACES YOU COULD GO TO IN

00:39:36.006 --> 00:39:38.008
SOCIAL WORK SO FFA IS LOSE

00:39:38.075 --> 00:39:40.211
THEIR WORKERS TO OTHER AREAS OF

00:39:40.277 --> 00:39:41.679

00:39:48.552 --> 00:39:50.888
DISCREPANCY HOW WE CAN RAISE IN

00:39:50.955 --> 00:39:52.790
THE EQUAL LEVEL. I THINK THAT

00:39:52.857 --> 00:39:54.391
SAYS SOMETHING FOR ME AS AN ART

00:39:54.458 --> 00:39:55.493
SOMEWHERE AND I THINK THIS IS

00:39:55.559 --> 00:39:57.128
