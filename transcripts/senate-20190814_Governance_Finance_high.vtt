00:13:19.198 --> 00:13:19.732
THEY CAN GET THE CREDIT. THIS

00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:20.332
IS AN ADDITIONAL CREDIT THAT

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:21.066
THEY WOULD BE APPLYING FOR AND

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:21.667
SO THIS IS WE DON'T THERE'S NO

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:23.669
POTENTIAL LOSS FOR THE STATE.

00:13:23.736 --> 00:13:24.470
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT EXTENDING

00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:25.738
CREDIT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT

00:13:25.804 --> 00:13:27.706
PARTNER EXACTLY SO THERE'S NO

00:13:27.773 --> 00:13:31.076
ACTUAL RISK IN THIS CASE TO THE

00:13:31.143 --> 00:13:32.211
STATE AND IT WOULD JUST GIVE

00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:33.579
THEM AN ADDITIONAL. CREDIT

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:34.146
RIGHT BUT IT WILL GIVE THE

00:13:34.213 --> 00:13:35.181
STATE THE RIGHT TO. AUDIT THE

00:13:35.247 --> 00:13:37.983
BOOKS AND ONLY WELL ONLY AT THE

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.553
TIME WHEN. BUT LIKE WHEN WE

00:13:40.619 --> 00:13:42.021
FIRST DECIDE WHAT THE ACTUAL

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:44.123
VALUE OF THIS THE COMPANY IS IN

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:44.657
THE STATE WOULD INTO AN

00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:47.393
INDEPENDENT. AUDITOR WOULD

00:13:47.459 --> 00:13:48.394
AUDIT THE COMPANY TO DECIDE

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.529
ACTUAL VALUE. AND THEN WHEN IT

00:13:50.596 --> 00:13:52.031
CAME TIME TO SELL THERE WOULD

00:13:52.097 --> 00:13:55.067
BE AN INDEPENDENT EVALUATION.

00:13:55.134 --> 00:13:55.668
AND IF IT JUST DIDN'T WORK OUT

00:13:55.734 --> 00:13:59.305
AND IT. NO LOSS TO US WE DIDN'T

00:13:59.371 --> 00:13:59.905
GIVE THEM CREDIT WE DIDN'T DO

00:13:59.972 --> 00:14:01.373
ANYTHING. WELL I'M I'M JUST

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.810
TRYING TO GET A DO WE HAVE ANY.

00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:05.377
SIMILAR PROGRAMS AROUND THE

00:14:05.444 --> 00:14:11.150
COUNTRY AT THE STATE. CALPERS.

00:14:11.217 --> 00:14:12.751
TOPICS ARE THE RIVER CALPERS A

00:14:12.818 --> 00:14:15.087
BY STOCK OF A COMPANY THAT'S

00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:18.457
THAT'S DIFFERENT ANIMAL

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:19.058
ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE INVESTED IN

00:14:19.124 --> 00:14:22.194
THE PAST AND SPECIFIC. AN

00:14:22.261 --> 00:14:24.263
IMPRESSIVE PROJECT MICROPHONE

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:24.863
ON ANY GIVEN THE SENATORS IN

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.065
SEVERAL YES THE CARLSON DOWN

00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:26.665
ASSEMBLY REVENUE AND TAXATION

00:14:26.732 --> 00:14:28.267
COMMITTEE. CALPERS HAS IN THE

00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:29.802
PAST INVESTED IN INDIVIDUAL

00:14:29.868 --> 00:14:31.670
COMPANIES THEY DON'T ALWAYS DO

00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:33.305
THAT SOMETIMES THEY GO THROUGH

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:35.274
A LARGER INSTITUTION THAT

00:14:35.341 --> 00:14:36.308
INVEST IN INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES

00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:39.044
THEY DON'T ALWAYS INVEST. JUST

00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:44.316
IN STOCKS PUBLICLY. TRADED

00:14:44.383 --> 00:14:44.850
COMPANIES YEAH IF IT WITH

00:14:44.917 --> 00:14:47.219
BRIGHT THEY HAVE. OTHER OTHER

00:14:47.286 --> 00:14:48.254
VENTURE CAPITAL THEY CAN INVEST

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:48.821
IN BUT THIS IS THIS IS WORK

00:14:48.887 --> 00:14:49.588
COMPANIES COMING UP AND SAYING.

00:14:49.655 --> 00:14:51.257
WE WANT TO CREDIT BUT WE'LL

00:14:51.323 --> 00:14:51.824
GIVE YOU SOMETHING FOR THAT

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.227
CREDIT TO TRADE OFF. RIGHT AND

00:14:55.294 --> 00:14:57.062
THEY'RE APPLYING ANYWAY SO IT'S

00:14:57.129 --> 00:14:58.430
JUST SIR OTHER COMES SO THIS IS

00:14:58.497 --> 00:15:00.532
JUST AN ADDITIONAL FACTOR THAT

00:15:00.599 --> 00:15:02.534
THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED AND THIS

00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:03.435
IS INITIAL VOLUNTARY FACTOR

00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:05.271
THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED. SO

00:15:05.337 --> 00:15:06.939
THEY'RE ALREADY COMING FOR THE

00:15:07.006 --> 00:15:07.640
CREDIT THIS IS JUST AN

00:15:07.706 --> 00:15:08.741
ADDITIONAL FACTOR THAT THING ON

00:15:08.807 --> 00:15:10.009
I'M LOOKING AT IS A CPA KINDA

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:12.478
GOING HOW WHAT I WOULD WHAT I.

00:15:12.544 --> 00:15:14.280
WHAT I CALL A IT JUST DEPENDS

00:15:14.346 --> 00:15:15.481
AND IT ALSO DEPENDS ON THE SIZE

00:15:15.547 --> 00:15:16.415
OF THE COMPANY FOR A LARGER

00:15:16.482 --> 00:15:18.517
COMPANY IT'S EASIER TO PRIDE

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:19.752
PROVIDE MORE INCENTIVES FOR A

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:21.053
SMALLER COMPANY THEY HAVE LESS

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.254
INCENTIVES AND SO THIS IS

00:15:22.321 --> 00:15:23.856
ACTUALLY A BENEFIT TO SMALL

00:15:23.922 --> 00:15:26.425
BUSINESSES. THAT ARE APPLYING

00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:27.059
