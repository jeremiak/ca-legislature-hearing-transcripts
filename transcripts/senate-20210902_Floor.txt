AND THE SOLAR FINANCING STRUCTURE CALL THE PARTNERSHIP FLIP ASTRONAUT. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR A QUESTION THE OTHER. WOULD YOU ROUTE TICKET QUESTION CERTAINTY. HE WILL BE THE CHAIR. WHEN YOU TOOK THE ASSEMBLY MINUTE AMENDMENTS I JUST WANNA CONFIRM THAT THIS IS FOR ONE FLIP NOT MULTIPLE FLIPS AND THAT WILL. SEVERELY IMPACTED THOSE THAT- ED USE THIS FLIPPING STRATEGY TO DO DIVERSION- ON TAXES AND OTHER THINGS. I BELIEVE SO IT'S THE LANGUAGE. THE CURRENT AMENDMENTS WE'RE ANY PARTNERSHIP YOU CAN TRIP WITH THE STORY GIVEN ANY PARTNERSHIP TRANSACTION UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL RESULT IN COMPENSATION TO THE COUNTY. WHICH ONE WHICH TRANSACTION OCCURS EQUAL TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE ANNUAL PROPERTY TAX LOSS IS CALCULATED BY THE COUNTY ASSESSOR'S I DO NOT KNOW IF IT WAS MULTIPLE FLIPS I HAVE NOT. BUILT INTO IT THAT DEEPLY I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BUT IT'S- IT'S IN FULL IT IS INFORMED BY THE POLICY OF THE STATE WE FIND THROUGHOUT LEGISLATION WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE RENEWABLES. I KNOW THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED MANY TIME IN THAT REGARD BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU WITH GREAT CERTAINTY THAT YOU ASKED THIS QUESTION NOW WHETHER IT'S MULTIPLE OR NOT. OKAY THANK YOU SIR I'M ON MY OWN TIME SO THE WAY THE ASSEMBLY AMENDMENTS SPECIFY THAT PROPERTY TAXES COLLISIONS ONLY APPLIED TO ONE PARTNERSHIP FLIP TRANSACTION FOR SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS AND CLARIFY THE EXCLUSION DOES NOT APPLY IF THE PARTY SALE EXCHANGE OWNERSHIP OF THE PARTNERSHIP OR LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY IN THE TRANSACTION. THAT IS A SEPARATE FROM THE PARTNERSHIP CLICK TRANSACTION SO TECHNICALLY I GUESS IF THERE WAS A PARTNERSHIP FLIP TRANSACTION MY UNDERSTANDING BASED ON THE AMENDMENTS AND I'M JUST ASKING YOU IF THAT'S YOUR INTENT I MEAN YEAH THE INTENT OF US IN THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU KNOW HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN RESOURCES FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS ON SOLAR STAFF. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT MULTIPLE FLIPS AND MULTIPLE PARTNERSHIPS CAN'T CONTINUE TO DO THAT TO RESTRICT RESOURCES GOING BACK TO THE COUNTY AND I JUST WAS GOING TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR AMENDMENT IN THE ASSEMBLY BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY I READ IT. BUT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE. THAT WAS YOUR INTENT. ON THAT BRANCH OF MY CLOTHES RANGE AREA AN- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT IN THE ASSEMBLY MY HOPE IS THAT WHAT IS WRITTEN DOWN IS THE INTENT OF THE AUTHOR TO PREVENT THAT FROM BEING AND DESTRUCTIVE AGAINST COUNTIES THAT PROVIDE SOLAR ENERGY TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN I. VOTE- IF THE AMENDMENT STANCE. VERY GOOD IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SAYING MAN SENATOR HERTZBERG YOU MAY CONCLUDE THANK YOU QUICKLY JUST FOR THE RECORD. THERE IS A FINANCIAL MECHANISM NECESSARY TO ON THE ONE HAND. TAKE ADVANTAGE OF GETTING INVESTORS AND FIGURING OUT HOW THAT FINANCIAL MECHANISMS WORK THIS LAW HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO CLARIFY ANY ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THAT TRANSFER WE DON'T I THINK THAT. THAT THAT THE QUESTION MAY BE THE ANSWER THE QUESTION MAY BE CORRECT IN THE SENSE THAT THE PURPOSE WAS NOT MULTIPLE. BUT I DON'T WANT TO PUT MYSELF ON THE RECORD BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE SUCH SPECIFICS AS SPECIFICITY BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT IT WAS TO ACCOMMODATE THIS FINANCING MECHANISM. THAT ALLOWS US TO ATTRACT FINANCIAL INVESTORS AT THE SAME TIME ALLOW THE TRANSFER. OTHERWISE AND MAKE THIS MECHANISM WORK WHICH IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THE FINANCING STRUCTURE FOR THE SOLAR PROJECTS THANK YOU. ASTRONOMICAL. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALAN HI I.

DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. CENTER GROVE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I RESPECTFULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL- IS THAT WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING RIGHT TO CREATE AN ADDITIONAL TAX REVENUE AND REVENUE FOR. ABIT VEHICLES- TRAVELED IS NOT A GOOD SITUATION ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE THAT LIVE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES AND YOU KNOW MY DISTRICT GOES FRIEND KERN COUNTY FIVE HOURS TO THE SOUTH. EAST TO NEEDLES- A LOT OF OUR PEOPLE THAT TRAVEL TRAVEL FROM KERN COUNTY TO TULARE COUNTY INTO RURAL AREAS IT'S JUST NOT FEASIBLE FOR US TO BE CHARGE WE WOULD BE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY THE TAXES- ENTER VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED BECAUSE- I MEAN AND- I MEAN I'M JUST ASSUMING THAT IN SAN FRANCISCO I MEAN I'M SURE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DRIVE CARS IN A LONG DISTANCE THEY- TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION THE BART- BUT I KNOW THAT. YOU KNOW FOR IN MY DISTRICT YOU DRIVE EIGHTEEN MILES TO THE GROCERY STORE FROM WHERE I LIVE SO I THINK IT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS AFFECTS THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND IT AFFECTS RULES A CALIFORNIA AND WOULD MAKE. CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A FAIR TAX BASE WOULD- DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT THEM SO I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE. THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SINGMAN CENTER WINNER YOU MAY CONCLUDE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I APPRECIATE THEIR MARKS OUR CALLERS FROM BAKERSFIELD I ACTUALLY THINK THAT THE EXACT. OPPOSITE IS TRUE IN MANY WAYS BECAUSE CURRENTLY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE TO DRIVE LONG DISTANCES BECAUSE OF- THE- IT'S A RURAL AREA OR OR MORE SPREAD OUT AREA. THEY ARE CURRENTLY PAYING MORE GAS TAXES THAN PEOPLE WHO DRIVE SHORT DISTANCES YOU HAVE TO DRIVE A HUNDRED MILES EVERY DAY. THEN YOU'RE PAYING A LOT MORE GAS TAXES THAN SOMEONE IN AN URBAN SETTING. WHO IS- PAIN DRIVING FIVE OR TEN MILES A DAY SO WHETHER IT'S VMT OR GAS TAX FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DRIVING LONGER DISTANCES THEY'RE GOING TO PAY MORE AND THAT DOESN'T CHANGE WHEN YOU TRANSITION. FROM GAS TAX TO BE ABOUT MILES TRAVELLED. I WILL TELL YOU SPEAKING OF SAN FRANCISCO. THERE ARE A LOT OF SAN FRANCISCANS AND OTHER URBAN DWELLERS WHO WILL BE. IMPACTED AND PAY MORE BECAUSE OF THE ANTI BECAUSE THEY HAVE A ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES RIGHT NOW ANYONE WHO HAS AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE AND- I WOULD- EXPECT DISPROPORTIONATELY THAN MY DISTRICT HAS MORE THAN- CENTER FROM BAKERSFIELD. KING ZERO IN GAS TAXES BECAUSE THEY USE NO GAS. THEY WILL PAY FOR BMT AND THEY SHOULD BECAUSE THAT IS THE EQUITABLE THING TO DO BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU HAVE A ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE. YOU'RE STILL PUTTING WEAR AND TEAR ON THE ROADS. THIS IS AN EQUITABLE APPROACH BUT IN THE END. THIS IS A STUDY SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT DO WE DO. AS GAS TAXES DIMINISH. BECAUSE WE STILL NEED TO FIX OUR ROADS AND HIGHWAYS AND SUPPORT OUR TRANSIT SYSTEMS. COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALAN I ARCHULETA I.

ENTER LAYERED THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THIS IS ABOUT A FIRE. IN OUR HEARTS. IS DOMINATING THE STATE RIGHT NOW AND WHAT WE HAVE DONE FOR FIRE PREVENTION HAS BEEN WHATEVER WE HAVE PUT IN THE BUDGET EVERY YEAR WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS SAYS WE WILL HAVE A MULTI YEAR PLAN. THAT TAKES THE GOALS OF THE LEGISLATURE THE GOALS OF THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE CAN PLAN YEAR TO YEAR FOUR AND WE CAN MEASURE WHAT'S BEEN DONE AND PRESCRIBED FIRE WHAT'S BEEN DONE AND FEELS MANAGEMENT WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN FORCE MANAGEMENT. OF THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN THE ASSEMBLY OR TECHNICAL ANOTHER CO AUTHOR- THEIR SUPPORT ON BOTH SIDES I ASKED FOR AN AUTOGRAPH. DISCUSSION AND DEBATE CENTERED DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS AS AS MANY YOU KNOW. THE DIXIE FIRE- AND NOW THE CALIBER FIRE HAS CONSUMED IN MY DISTRICT BURNED OVER A MILLION ACRES IN THE LAST. SIX WEEKS. AND SOMEOF THE FRUSTRATIONS THAT WE FINDAN IN THE AGENCIES WE HAVE CAL FIRE WHO TAKES CARE OF STATE LANDS. WE HAVE THE FOR SERVICE AND THE B. L. M. IN THE PARK SERVICES THAT TAKE CARE OF THE FEDERAL LANDS. AND THERE'S CONFLICT BETWEEN HOW THEY EVEN OPERATE. FOR SERVICE MANAGES FIRES. THEY DON'T PUT HIM OUT SO HUGE PROBLEM WE HAVE TO WAIT ACTUALLY CAL FIRE SAID SOMETIMES AND WAITS FOR THE FIRE BEFORE THEY CAN ENGAGE. WHEN I GET ON STATE PROPERTY. JUST LAST WEEK- AND I'VE BEEN TOURING MY FIRES I'VE BEEN LOOKING IN MY COMMUNITIES AND I AND WE HAVE. INTERACTION BETWEEN STATE LANDS IN FEDERAL LANDS AND SO LAST WEEK. AND I AND I GETTING VIDEOS. FROM PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY OUT THERE FIGHTING THE FIRE CONTRACTORS BUT WE HAVE DOZERS SITTING. BULLDOZERS ON TRUCKS SITTING AS A BUYER'S APPROACHING HOUSE AND I HAVE PRIVATE CITIZENS. FIGHTING FIRE ON THEIR OWN LAND IN THE DOES ARE MOVING. SO THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WHERE WHAT IS THE POLICIES WE'VE HEARD. THAT THE GET THE PRESS THAT THE GOVERNOR ASKED THE PRESIDENT TO. PUSH HARDER THAT. THE FOREST SERVICE ACTUALLY PUT FIRES OUT. SO I JUST WANT TO LET THE CENTERS NO ACTUALLY WENT ON SUNDAY AND TOOK MY FIRE CLASS I HAVE THE CAR NOW TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND FIGHT ON A FIRE AND I'M GONNA DO THAT WHEN WEGET OUT OF SESSION I'M GONNA GO ACTUALLY HIEROCLES CONTRACTOR SO I CAN SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND. SO WE CAN HOPEFULLY STOP THESE CATASTROPHIC FIRES IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE BURNING UP. MILLIONS OF ACRES THERE'S HABITATS WILDLIFE IT'S OUR WATERSHED. AS WE'RE DOING BILLS TODAY SITTING HERE TALKING ABOUT. TRANSPORTATION IN THE MISSIONS THAT COME UP IN TRANSFORMATIONS WHICH THESE FIRES DWARF. AND WE SPEND VERY LITTLE RESOURCES. ON ACTUALLY PREVENTING FIRE IN TAHOE. THE REASON WHEN IT CAME IN A CHRISTMAS VALLEY THAT WE WERE ABLE TO BACKFIRE IS BECAUSE WE PUT IN FUEL BREAKS THERE AND ALLOWTHE FIREFIGHTERS TO COME IN AND SET THE BACKFIRE TO BURN THE FUEL WAY SO WE CAN ACTUALLY SAVE OUR COMMUNITIES WE NEED THAT IN EVERY COMMUNITY. THROUGHOUT YOUR DISTRICTS WHETHER IT'S CHAPARRAL AND BRUSH OR TREES SO I'M SUPER EXCITED ABOUT THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION I WANTED TO ACTUALLY WORK THOUGH WE NEED TO NOT JUST TALK ABOUT IT. WE'RE GONNA BE FACING THIS EVERY SINGLE YEAR. WE SEE A RED FLAG WARNINGS WE'VE SEEN DRY FUELS. WE HAD NO RAIN. AND WHAT WE DO WE SPEND MOST OF OUR RESOURCES ON INCENTIVIZING SOMEBODY TO HAVE ELECTRIC VEHICLE IS NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING. TO STOP THE POLLUTION AND THE DESTRUCTION OF CALIFORNIA'S NATURAL RESOURCE WHICH IS OUR WATERSHEDS SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORFOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AS YOU CAN TELL I'M SOMEWHAT FRUSTRATED I'VE BEEN. FOR TEN YEARS. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A BETTER WAY TO DO WHAT WE DO AND WE HAVE TO HAVE. WE HAVE TO HAVE A PARTNERSHIP A TRUE PARTNERSHIP. WITH THE FEDERAL WITH THE FEDS BECAUSE IF WE DON'T IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO BURN AND IT'S REALLY OUT OF CONTROL THANK YOU. FOR BRINGING THIS MAJOR FOREIGN I RESPECTFULLY ASK AN IPHONE S. B. FOUR FIVE SIX. SENATOR NIELSEN. QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR. YOUR LEAD WILL YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION OF COURSE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THERE'S ANY SUCH PROVISION IN THIS BILL BUT I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY THERE IS AN UNFORTUNATE PROVISION IN THE BUDGET THAT I HOPE WE'RE GOING TO GET REPEALED BEFORE THE SESSION ENDS. THAT SAYS THE EXPENDITURE OF A HALF A BILLION DOLLARS FOR SOME WHILE AND MANAGEMENT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT IS COOL NEEDED. AT WE'VE GOT TO GET THAT OUT OF THE BUDGET DOES THAT IS THAT IN THIS BILL THAT PROVISION GIVING THE AUTHORITY THE ADMINISTRATIVE BRANCH NUMBER THERE'S NOTHING ALONG THOSE LINES IN THIS BILL. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTER LAYERED YOU MAY CONCLUDE THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS BY OUR COLLEAGUES AND LET ME MAKE TWO QUICK POINTS. OF WHEN I WAS AT NATURAL RESOURCES ALMOST HALF OF THE MONEY THAT WE SPENT ON FIRE PREVENTION FROM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS WENT TO FEDERAL FORCE WE STEPPED IN WE DID THAT ON THIS FLOOR EARLIER THIS WEEK WE ADOPTED A BILL- OR SEND IT BACK I THINK MAYBE IT IS SIMPLY THAT REALLY BEEFED UP THE GOOD NEIGHBOR AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SO THE STATE COULD. COULD STEP IN AND SENATOR DOLLY IS RIGHT WHEN I WAS RESOURCES SECRETARY HAT CREEK IN HIS DISTRICT- HAD A FIRE THAT WOULD BURN OUT IN CALIFORNIA OF THE FEDERAL LANDS AND CALIFORNIA WOULD MOVE IN AND BEAT IT BACK. AND IN THE END THEY LOST THE MAJOR BUILDING IN HAT CREEK BECAUSE OF THAT AND ENTER AND SO- THAT'S WHY THESE GOOD NEIGHBOR DEALS ARE GOOD AND THAT'S WHY IT'S GOOD IN THIS BILL TO PLAN SO WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WHERE WE'RE OING AND HOW WE'RE DOING AND WE CAN PUSH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO APPROPRIATELY THEIR SUPPORT.

THREE YEARS AGO THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT REQUESTED THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BOARD OF REGENTS MOVE SIX PART TIME FACULTY JOB CLASSIFICATIONS FOR LECTURERS ACTIVELY COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.

ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BERMAN AN ACT RELATING TO ELECTIONS. THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU SENATE PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS OF LAST YEAR ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND I WORKED ON A PROVISION THAT PROVIDED FOR. EVERY ELIGIBLE REGISTERED ACTIVE VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE A BALLOT IN THE MAIL WHICH THEY COULD RETURN IN THE MAIL THE ELECTION WAS INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF VOTER TURNOUT AND VOTER ACCESS FACT WE HAD THE HIGHEST VOTER TURNOUT SINCE. HARRY TRUMAN WAS PRESIDENT. THIS BILL AT THIRTY SEVEN MAKES THAT POLICY PERMANENT BEYOND TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE- IT ALSO DID IT JUST FOR THE- REQUIREMENTS FOR COUNTIES UNDER THIRTY THOUSAND IN TERMS OF THEIR- REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE- LOCATIONS FOR DROP BOXES I URGE AND I VOTE. IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. CENTER GROVE. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RESPECTFULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION OF AB THIRTY SEVEN THE PRACTICE OF AUTOMATICALLY SENDING OUT BALLOTS IN AN ELECTION OF AN ELECTION TO EVERY CALIFORNIAN FROM JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO FORWARD WITH WILL WITHOUT A DOUBT RESULTED MORE DISTRESSED IN THE VOTING PROCESS. ALEX WILL BE SENT TO EVERY CALIFORNIAN BASED ON- AND MAINTAIN VOTER ROLL SIMILAR TO THE EDT DEBACLE THAT WE HAVE GOING ON WHERE- EDT NOTIFICATIONS ARE SENT TO YOU KNOW HUNDREDS TO EACH HOUSEHOLD WE HAVEN'T UPDATED OUR VOTER ROLLS IN DECADES. WE HAVE A PURGE VOTER ROLLS IN DECADES WE CONSTANTLY ASKED FOR. A EXEMPTION FROM THE FEDERAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO UPDATE OUR VOTER ROLLS HAND- THIS. PARTICULAR BILL WILL CREATE DISTRESSED- IN THE VOTING PROCESS. THESE VOTER ROLLS ARE ALREADY A MESS FROM THE DMV'S PRACTICE OF AUTOMATICALLY REGISTERING CALIFORNIANS TO VOTE CREATING A CATCH ALL SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS IN ELIGIBLE VOTERS TO PARTICIPATE. SENDING UNSOLICITED BALLOTS WILL CREATE AN INFLUX IN THE NUMBER OF BALLOTS MULTIPLE BALLOTS WILL INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FRAUD AND UNDERMINE THE INTEGRITY OF OUR ELECTIONS. I STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS LEGISLATION. THAT COMES AT A TIME WHEN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF VOTERS ALREADY HAVE LOST THEIR CONFIDENCE IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. I CAN TELL YOU STORY AFTER STORY THAT CAME INTO MY DISTRICT AND IF YOU GUYS WERE HONEST ABOUT THE SUBJECT MATTER YOU WOULD KNOW THAT. THEY CAME INTO YOUR DISTRICTS AS WELL BECAUSE I'M I'M VERY CONFIDENT IT'S NOT JUST HAPPENING IN KERN AND TULARE COUNTIES. I CAN TELL YOU THAT- INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FOURTEEN GOT BACK OF BALLOTS AND MAIL TO THEIR HOUSE I CAN TELL YOU AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW BECAUSE HE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE ON THE DMV ROLLS. I CAN TELL YOU THAT SEVERAL PEOPLE GOT BALLOTS IN SEVERAL NAMES- USING FIRST AND LAST NAME FIRST MIDDLE AND LAST NAME FIRST NAME MIDDLE INITIAL AND LAST NAME. SO I JUST THINK MAKING THIS PROCESS A- A FUR EVER PROCESS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOES UNDERMINE THE ELECTION INTEGRITY THAT WE HAVING CREATES. A MECHANISM AND TO ALLOW FRAUD A FRAUD TO BE EXPANDED AND- WE SHOULD HAVE SOME RAUD MECHANISMS IN PLACE BEFORE WE MAKE THIS LAW PERMANENT THANK YOU. RATHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SENATOR WIENER. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I THINK THAT THE- THAT THE ONLY REASON THAT THERE IS DISTRUSTS BY ANYONE IN OUR VOTING SYSTEM IS BECAUSE OF THE UNFOUNDED FALSE CONSPIRACY THEORIES THAT ARE BEING SPREAD ON SOCIAL MEDIA- ON FOX NEWS- AND OTHER- RIGHT WING OUTLETS THAT ARE INTENTIONALLY SPREADING FALSE CONSPIRACY THEORIES TO TRY TO UNDERMINE TRUST IN OUR ELECTORAL SYSTEM ON OUR ELECTION SYSTEM. THAT'S THE ONLY REASON THERE'S DISTRUST. EXPANDING THE ABILITY TO VOTE WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE DOING TODAY THAT DOES NOT- REDUCE TRUST OF COURSE IF IT'S DISTORTED INTO A CONSPIRACY THEORY BY FOX NEWS AT ALL- THE INDICTMENT AFFILIATION CAN REDUCE TRUST BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE TODAY. IS TRYING TO EXPAND THE AND MAKE IT EASIER. FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE WE'RE DOING THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT IS HAPPENING IN PLACES LIKE TEXAS. AND GEORGIA. AND SOME OF THESE% OTHER STATES THAT ARE TRYING TO MAKE A REALLY REALLY REALLY HARD. FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE AND PARTICULARLY TO MAKE IT HARD FOR CITY DWELLERS FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR FOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE FOR STUDENTS TRYING TO MAKE IT HARD FOR THEM TO VOTE IN ORDER TO MANIPULATE THE RESULTS OF THE ELECTION. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS LET'S HAVE EVERYONE GO LET'S SEND IT TO REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND SENIORS AND STUDENTS AND PEOPLE OF EVERY RACE SOME BACKGROUND IT SAYS MAKE AN EQUAL PLAYING FIELD EVERYONE GETS A BALLOT. INSTEAD OF TRYING TO SHUT DOWN THE PROCESS TO MANIPULATE AND TO UNFAIRLY. INFLUENCE THE RESULT WHAT TEXAS IN GEORGIA DURING DOTS WHAT UNDERMINES FAITH IN THE VOTING PROCESS THIS INCREASES FAITH IN THE VOTING PROCESS AND I ALSO FEAR I'VE- FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE CENTERED DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT JUST WANT TO SAY. I'M GONNA PUT OUT SOME AND MAYBE SOME OF THE ACTOR CESAR I DON'T WATCH FOX NEWS. BUT I READ THE LA TIMES ONCE IN A WHILE AND THERE WAS JUST RECENTLY. A GENTLEMAN. PULLED OVER WHO HAD METHAMPHETAMINES AN ASSAULT RIFLE. AND A HOST BOXES FULL OF BALLOTS IN THIS ELECTION SO WE HAVE SOME PROBLEMS THIS IS THE FACE THAT WE HAVE SOME PROBLEMS WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. TRACK AND FIGURE OUT A BETTER WAY THAN WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S WHY THERE'S DISTRUST IN THE PROCESS. SENATOR LEYVA. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WANT TO LINE MY COMMENTS WITH THOSE OF THE SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND I ALSO WANT TO BE HONEST ELSE WAS REQUESTED BY THE SENATOR FROM BAKERSFIELD AND JUST SAY THAT WE DID NOT RECEIVE ANY CALLS IN MY OFFICE HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN EITHER MY DISTRICT OFFICES FROM ANYONE SAYING THAT THERE WERE ANY APPROPRIATE THING INAPPROPRIATE THINGS HAPPENING WITH BALLOTS WE DO HEAR FROM PEOPLE IS WITH THE CENTER FROM SECOND- FROM SAN FRANCISCO SAID. ACCESS THIS THIS IS REALLY A PARTISAN ISSUE DEMOCRATS WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS ACCESS TO A VOTE REPUBLICANS DON'T THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THE PEOPLE THAT THEY WANT TO VOTE HAVE ACCESS TO VOTE SO REALLY THIS IS A VERY PARTISAN ISSUE I LOOK FORWARD TO VOTING ON THIS BILL VOTING HI AND WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM AND WE DO NEED TO FIX IT IT'S ABOUT MISINFORMATION IT'S ABOUT DISTRUST BUT IT'S NOT BEING CREATED BY THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR BATES. PRESIDENT I AM A REPUBLICAN AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY BUILDS FOOD TO CALL THIS A PARTISAN ISSUE- AND GENERALIZATION- THE NARRATIVE IS CONTINUALLY GENERALIZED TO OUR PARTY AND I TAKE OFFENSE AT THAT ALL I WALKED FIVE THOUSAND PRECINCTS WITHOUT FOLKS IN A NONPARTISAN ELECTION TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY VOTED SOME OF THEM ARE NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR ME AND MADE IT VERY CLEAR BUT I SAID IT'S STILL IMPORTANT TO VOTE AND MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD I BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING THAT THOSE OF US WHO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS. I FEEL VERY VERY- COMPASSIONATE ABOUT WE CAN UNDO THE DISTRUST IF WE START BY TAKING A NONPARTISAN VIEW OF THE EVANGELICAL ANTIDOTE FULL STORIES OF OUR REPORTS THAT ARE COMING IN AND REQUIRE OUR SECRETARY OF STATE IN OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL TO TAKE A DEEPER DIVE INTO THOSE ACTS ARE ALLEGATIONS ARE MY OFFICE WAS OVERWHELMED DURING THE DMV MOTOR VOTER WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE MISS REGISTERED. AS REPUBLICANS WHEN THEY WANTED TO BE DEMOCRATS DID WE NOT REPORT THAT YOU BET YOUR BOTTOM WE REPORTED IT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT RIGHT AND WE HAD PEOPLE WHO RECEIVED TWO BALLOTS ARE DID WE REPORT THAT YOU BET YOUR BOTTOM WE DID FOR THE TWO ACCUSED US OF BEING THE ONES THAT HAVE CREATED THIS FALSE NARRATIVE BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY MANY STORIES ACROSS THIS NATION THAT VALIDATE THAT THERE'S A LACK OF TRUST BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE EXPERIENCED THESE VERY THINGS SO I CALL ON ATTORNEY GENERAL I CALL ON OUR SECRETARY OF STATE AND I CALL ON THIS BODY. THE STOP PROPAGATING THE FALSE NARRATIVE LET'S GET DOWN TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AND MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRATS THEIR RIGHTS ARE PRESERVED AND IF WE KEEP TURNING A DELPHI OUR IDEA OF FEAR IN A BLIND GUY JUST BECAUSE FOX NEWS- SOMETHING THAT'S WRONG WE ARE ALL INTELLIGENT. EDUCATED AND WE KNOW WE IT GET HERE WITHOUT BEING OF THE P. BY THE PEOPLE IN FOR THE P. WHICH IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY. AND THAT'S WHAT I INTEND TO DO THANK YOU. CENTERMAN. I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN MANY STUDIES INCLUDING BY REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS. AND NATIONAL LEVEL TO STATE LEVEL AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THERE'S BEEN ANY ELECTION FRAUD- OR OR ANYTHING OTHER THAN MINUTE DIMINISHED ALEXION FRAUD WHEN IT COMES TO- INDIVIDUAL VOTER FRAUD. THE MAJOR THREATS TO ELECTION SECURITY COME FROM HACKING CYBER SECURITY AT ALL. AND I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL- OUR REPUBLICAN COUNTERPARTS HAVE CONSISTENTLY BLOCKED EFFORTS TO TRY TO. INCREASE FUNDING FOR ELECTION SECURITY CYBERSECURITY ALIKE WHILE FOCUSING ON THESE VERY RANDOM. CASES THERE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA SOMETHING LIKE TWENTY FIVE MILLION VOTERS HI THAT MEANS INEVITABLY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE OCCASIONAL MISTAKES BUT THE IDEA THAT THIS IS SOMEHOW SYSTEMIC. ARE YOU CAN TAKE ISOLATED INCIDENTS AND TRY TO PORTRAY THEM INTO NARRATIVE AND I THINK THAT IS ALL ECHO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SPOKEN BEFORE. THERE IS A DELIBERATE ATTEMPT RIGHT NOW TO TRY TO PAINT A NARRATIVE THAT THERE IS SYSTEMIC ELECTION FRAUD HAPPENING. AND I THINK THIS IS COMPLETELY LUDICROUS IT'S BEEN DEBUNKED BY EVERYONE INCLUDING BY REPUBLICANS HAVE GONE UP AND TRY TO FIND EVIDENCE OF ELECTION FRAUD. THE MAJOR THREAT TO OUR ELECTION SECURITY AGAIN IS CYBER SECURITY IT'S NOT FROM THESE EXCESS BALLOTS PAPER BALLOTS IN THE LIKE AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR EYE BUT THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE. AT A TIME WHEN TOO MANY STATES ARE TRYING TO LIMIT OUR FRANCHISE OUR HEARD EARNED RIGHT TO VOTE WHETHER IT'S FOR WOMEN OR MINORITIES OR FOR MANY OF US WHO'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO VOTE FOR A FEW GENERATIONS. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE EMPHASIZE THAT IN A DEMOCRACY THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS AT THE HEART OF THAT AND WE THIS IS A BILL THAT THAT FURTHERS THAT CAUSE SO AGAIN I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. SENATOR BURGESS I. REALLY WASN'T PLANNING THANK YOU NINE PRESENT WAS A PLAN AND TALKING ABOUT THIS. I THINK THERE'S THERE THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT POINTS THAT BOTH. SIDES HAVE MADE ON THIS ISSUE- LAST WEEK I RECEIVED TWO BALLOTS. IN THE RECALL. AND I'M CERTAIN I'M NOT ALONE ONE WENT TO MY PRIMARY ADDRESS AND I FILLED OUT AND MAILED IT IN AND THEN ANOTHER CAME A COUPLE DAYS LATER TO- MY IN LAWS HOUSE. NOW I AM NOT OF THE OPINION THAT. THERE IS A SYSTEMIC EFFORT IN MY HOME COUNTY TO UNDO ELECTIONS- IN A AT A MASS SCALE THAT CAN CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF AN ELECTION BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT- INTO THE POINT MADE EARLIER BY MY COLLEAGUE- FROM. IRVINE AND ONE EARLIER BY MY COLLEAGUE FROM BAKERSFIELD. IS THAT IT'S INCUMBENT ON US TO WORK WITH OUR LOCAL OFFICIALS. ARE STATE OFFICIALS. TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT PEOPLE. HAVE GREATER TRUST IN OUR VOTING PROCESS WORKS SO IF I'M GETTING TWO BALLOTS- I KNOW THAT OTHERS ARE ARE GETTING MULTIPLE BALLOTS AS WELL THAT FEEDS INTO THIS NARRATIVE. OF DISTRUST. SO MAKING CERTAIN THAT WE CLEAN UP THE VOTER ROLLS IN A WAY THAT ALSO CAN BE PUT OUT THERE INTO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN THAT THEY ARE IN FACT. CLEAN AND MORE UP TO DATE WOULD BE TERRIBLY HELPFUL. SENATOR MELINDA IS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. R. I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF THERE ARE MEMBERS OF THIS BODY WHO HAVE NOT RECEIVED PHONE CALLS OR EMAILS FROM THEIR CONSTITUENTS SAYING THAT. THEY OR SOMEONE THEY KNOW RECEIVED MORE THAN ONE BALLOT OR THEY OR SOMEONE THEY KNOW RECEIVE DEVELOPER SOMEONE WHO IS DECEASED- THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME AND I GET THESE TYPES OF COMMENTS FROM DEMOCRATS AS WELL AS REPUBLICANS IN MY DISTRICT WHO HAVE CONCERNS. WITH BALLOT INTEGRITY THIS IS. IT'S MORE THAN A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING TO HEAR ANYBODY ON THIS FLOOR STAND UP AND SAY THAT THIS IS A PARTISAN ISSUE. BECAUSE IT IS NOT IT IS AN ISSUE OF SIFT SYSTEMIC MISTRUST. OF THE SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND THAT HAS DEGRADED TO A POINT WHERE PEOPLE DON'T FEEL. THAT THE SYSTEM IS WORKING THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED TO- I DON'T KNOW WHY ANYBODY WOULD BE OPPOSED TO MAKING SURE THAT THE VOTER ROLLS. ARE CLEAN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DECEASED OR NOT GETTING BALLOTS SICK PEOPLE. WHO DO GET A BALLAD DON'T GET ANOTHER ONE A FEW DAYS LATER THIS IS COMMON SENSE EVERYONE SHOULD BE FOR THESE TYPES OF MEASURES TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS WORKING. THE WAY IT IS INTENDED SO IT'S NOT A PARTISAN ISSUE DESPITE SOME THE TRY TO MAKE IT INTO THAT- AND I WOULD- JUST ASK YOU MAYBE PERHAPS. GO BACK THROUGH THE EMAILS THAT YOU RECEIVED OUR CHECK YOUR VOICE MAILS BECAUSE I SUSPECT HE WILL FIND PEOPLE OF YOUR DISTRICT TO HAVE SIMILAR COMPLAINTS THANK YOU. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE. SENATOR UMBERG YOU MAY CONCLUDE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT JUST TO RESPOND TO A FEW POINTS NUMBER ONE IN TERMS OF THE BALLOTS YOU CAN'T VOTE TWICE YOU'VE GOT A BALANCE WITH THE BAR CODE. WHEN YOU REGISTER TO VOTE. YOU REGISTERED THAT BALLOT THEN. IS SENT TO THE REGISTERED ADDRESS WITH THE BAR CODE IT COMES BACK WITH THE BAR CODE OF ANOTHER BALLOT COMES BACK WITH A SIMILAR BARCODE. THEN THOSE BALLOTS ARE PULLED NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO IS THAT WITH RESPECT TO. ALLEGATIONS OR REPORTS OF FOLKS RECEIVING MULTIPLE BALLOTS I HOPE YOU CALL YOUR REGISTRAR I HOPE YOU CALL YOUR REGISTRAR AND SAY HEY THERE'S AN ISSUE. IF THERE IS FRAUD I HOPE YOU CALL YOUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY AND SAY THERE'S AN ISSUE BUT YOU KNOW THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN AFTER THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION AFTER THE TWENTY TWENTY ELECTION. THERE ARE VIRTUALLY NO REPORTS OF FRAUD THAT WERE FOUND TO BE. ACCURATE VIRTUALLY NONE IN TERMS OF DISTRUST. IF THERE IS DISTRUST AND PERHAPS THERE IS IT IS BECAUSE THAT DISTRUST WAS SPREAD. FROM THE FORMER PRESIDENT. BY WAY OF MANY MANY DIFFERENT MODALITIES AND SADLY SADLY THAT'S HIS MONEY IRONIES THOUGH IS IT IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LEE SUMMER TALKING ABOUT FRAUD AND MISUSE OF WE ACTUALLY EVERY REGISTRAR UPDATES THE VOTER ROLLS EVERY YEAR BUT ALSO THERE WERE AT LEAST FOUR DEMOCRATS THAT WERE. UNHAPPY ABOUT THE RESULTS IN CALIFORNIA IS YOU'LL NOTE THE REPORT DEMOCRATS THAT LOST HOUSE RACES. THAT SEEMS TO BE A BIT IRONIC IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THAT SOME BELIEVE THE ELECTION HERE WAS NOT CONDUCTED. PROPERLY. THIS IS AN EFFORT TO MAKE SURE. THAT VOTERS CAN EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT OF FRANCHISE LOOK AT THE SITUATION RIGHT NOW WITH THE FIRES. HOW MUCH BETTER IS IT THOSE WHO ARE IMPACTED BY THE FIRES CAN VOTE BY MAIL RATHER THAN RETURNING TO. THEIR PLACE OF RESIDENCE. IN ANY EVENT. COLLEAGUES THIS IS AN EFFORT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY ELIGIBLE REGISTERED ACTIVE CALIFORNIAN. CAN EXERCISE THEIR FRANCHISE. I URGE A NO VOTE.

TWENTY TWENTY LAST YEAR ANTI ASIAN HATE CRIMES SURGED BY A HUNDRED AND 49% HE CRIMES AGAINST GAY MEN JUMPED NEARLY 30% TO SEVENTY CRIMES ANTI TRANSGENDER HATE CRIMES ROSE ABOUT 26% WE'VE SEEN DRAMATIC INCREASES IN HATE CRIMES AGAINST JEWS AFTERMARKETS AND MANY OTHERS. ALREADY IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE LAPD IS REPORTED A 66% INCREASE IN HATE CRIMES OVERALL THE 26% INCREASE IN HATE CRIMES. BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION WHILE WE STILL HAVE SOME DATA ON THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF HATE CRIMES ARE BEING PERPETRATED EXPERTS SAY. THAT THE FBI DATA LIKELY UNDERCOUNTS THE NUMBER OF HATE CRIMES IN AMERICA BOTH BECAUSE MOST MANY VICTIMS DON'T REPORT INCIDENTS. AND LOCAL AGENCIES ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT A CRIME DATA TO THE FBI. TO DO THE STAGGERING STATISTICS ON THE CHALLENGE OF MONITORING COLLECTING ANALYZING THIS DATA. IT'S CLEAR THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS BETTER TOOLS AND DEDICATED INDIVIDUALS TO HELP US TRACK. AND REPORT THIS INFORMATION SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE. BY CREATING THIS COMMISSION TO MONITOR AND ASSESS CURRENT TRENDS RELATIVE TO HATE CRIMES.

MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN NINETY ONE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY AN ACT RELATING TO FIREARMS NOW SENATOR FOR DINNER. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS I'M PROUD TO PRESENT A B. ELEVEN NINETY ONE. ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLYMEMBER MCCARTY A BILL THAT WOULD JUMPSTART CALIFORNIA'S OWN CRIME GUN TRACING PROGRAM. THE CRIME GUN IS ANY FIREARM THAT IS ILLEGALLY POSSESSED USED IN A CRIME OR SUSPECTED TO HAVE BEEN USED IN A CRIME IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. THE AUTOMATIC AUTOMATED FARM SYSTEM APPROXIMATES THAT ORIGINATING FROM WITHIN THE STATE. AND WHILE THE G. D. O. J. BUREAU OF ALCOHOL TOBACCO AND FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES COLLECTS DATA ON FIREARMS ACQUISITION AND REGISTRATION THEY DO NOT CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE AVAILABLE DATA. ON SEIZED GUNS IF WE ARE TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE OUR FOCUS MUST BE ON THE INITIAL SOURCE OF CRIME GUNS FROM IRRESPONSIBLE DEALERS WHO PROFIT. OFF THE SALE OF FIREARMS AND INFILL INFILTRATED COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE PARTICULARLY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THERE ARE A LOT OF RESPECTABLE GUN DEALERS IN CALIFORNIA THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO OWN GUNS IN OUR STATE OUR LEGAL GUN OWNERS AND DON'T CREATE A PROBLEM HOWEVER. A SMALL MINORITY OF DEALERS SUPPLY THE CRIMINAL MARKET ABOUT 5% OF GUN DEALERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ABOUT 90% OF RECOVERED CRIME GUNS NATIONWIDE. THESE DEALERS CREATE DANGEROUS CONDITIONS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND ESPECIALLY IMPACT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. IN CALIFORNIA THE EFFECT. I ACCESS TO THE TRAFFIC FARM AND CAN OF COLOR CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED AFRICAN AMERICAN MEN WHO MAKE UP LESS THAN 4% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION. YET THEY REPRESENT 30% OF GUN HOMICIDE VICTIMS. AFRICAN AMERICANS BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FOUR PART EIGHTEEN TIMES AS LIKELY TO BE MURDERED WITH A GUN AS WHITE MEN OF THE SAME AGE AB ELEVEN NINETY ONE WILL ADDRESS THE GAP IN CRIME GUN TRACING. BY REQUIRING CALIFORNIA DOJ TO ANALYZE THE CRIME GUN DATA IT ALREADY HAS A DETERMINE TRENDS AND PATTERNS RELATED TO HOW CRIME CRIME GUNS ARE SOLD IN TRAFFIC. BY PROVIDING ANALYSIS ON HOW A CRIME GUNS ARE BEING DIVERTED FROM A LEGAL MARKET AND IDENTIFYING THE RESPONSIBLE DEALERS WE CAN PROPERLY ADDRESS AND ROUTE OUT ONE OF THE CAUSES OF GUN VIOLENCE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. SENATOR MEN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- WE HAVE SEEN TOO MANY GUN VIOLENCE EPISODES IN THIS STATE IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT THIRTY SEVEN SENATE DISTRICT I THINK IT'S NOT AN EXAGGERATION TO SAY WE ARE FACING A EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE TODAY AND IT'S ALL THAT TO BEGIN TO SOLVE THE CRISIS WE NEED BETTER DATA WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING. HI THIS IS A REGIONAL BILL- IT WILL HELP INFORM OUR SOLUTIONS WILL HELP INFORM US IN THE LEGISLATURE HI SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. SENATOR NELSON. THERE'S A GERM OF THE SENATE. THIS BILL HER. I WOULD ARGUE HAS SOME MERIT. BUT TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE PANACEA. IN THE HANDS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IT IS NOT. FEDERAL ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OF CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN ON ABLE. NOT WITHSTANDING SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES WE HAVE PROVIDED THEM WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. TO CONFISCATE THE WEAPONS OF PROVEN FELONS WHO USE GUNS IN THE COMMISSION OF THEIR CRIMES IN OR PROVE IT UPON THEIR RELEASE FROM CIS INTO SOCIETY TRUMP HAPPEN JUST GIVE UP THOSE GUNS. I THINK IT'S AROUND TEN THOUSAND NOW. AND WE'VE BEEN GIVEN THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO THAT AGENCY DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THE CONFISCATE THOSE GUNS. I'M GONNA CONTINUE TO PROPOSE THAT WE TAKE THAT AUTHORITY AWAY FROM THE CURRENT GENERAL AND GIVE IT TO THE LOCAL SHERIFF'S. WE COULD NOT. DO ANY WORSE THIS IS ONE WAY. AND A PATHWAY TO GET GUNS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THE HANDS. OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE PROVEN. THAT THEY WOULD DO HARM AND WHO ARE KNOWN TO HAVE WEAPONS. IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THIS SIDE OF. FURTHER DISCUSSION OR DEBATE SAYING NINE SENATOR BURTON KENO YOU MAY CONCLUDE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AND I VOTE ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT GUN SAFETY CRIME SAFETY COMMUNITY BASED HELP TO SOLVE THE VIOLENCE IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD PROBLEM I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE.

ASSEMBLY BILL ONE TWENTY FOUR BY SENATOR CAM WALKER AND ACTION RELATING TO CRIMINAL PROCEDURE SENATOR KAMMERER THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU- MADAM PRESIDENT GOOD AFTERNOON TO YOU AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB ONE TWO FOUR. JUSTICE FOR SURVIVORS IT IS A LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS PRIORITY BILL. THE ACLU ESTIMATES THAT NEARLY NATIONWIDE AND AS MANY AS 94% OF CERTAIN FEMALE PRISON POPULATIONS HAVE EXPERIENCED PHYSICAL OR SEXUAL ABUSE. BEFORE BEING INCARCERATED WE KNOW THAT SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL AND INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND OTHER SEVERE FORMS OF TRAUMA ARE MORE LIKELY TO LAND IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. YEAH OUR STATE'S CURRENT LEGAL FRAMEWORK LACKS CLEAR MECHANISMS TO CONSIDER RELEVANT FACTORS AND EXPERIENCES THAT CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMMISSION OF THAT OFFENCE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE SOCIETAL TRAUMA CROP CAUSED BY CRIMINALIZING THESE INDIVIDUALS SPANS GENERATIONS. EIGHTY ONE TO FOUR ADDRESSES GAPS AND FAILURES OF THE CURRENT LEGAL SYSTEM BY ALLOWING. NOT MANDATING ALLOWING THE COURT TO CONSIDER AT VARYING STAGES OF SENTENCING AND RESENTENCING. HOW THE DEFENDANT'S OWN TRAUMA CONTRIBUTED TO THE COMMISSION OF THE OFFENSE AND OR CONVICTION. THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN AN APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE STRUCK PROVISIONS RELATED TO CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES AND SENTENCE ENHANCEMENTS. EXCLUDING THE VIOLENT PANEL FELONIES FROM A CORE RELIEF ANTI AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE AND LIMIT THE MANDATE ON IMPOSING THE LOWER TERM AT SENTENCING TO WIN THE AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCES OUTWEIGH THE MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES. EIGHTY ONE TO FOUR WOULD SUPPORT MANY SURVIVORS MOSTLY WOMEN FEMALE SURVIVORS OF VIOLENCE SEXUAL VIOLENCE INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING BY REQUIRING THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM TO CONSIDER THE FULL CONTEXT OF RELEVANT FACTORS OF A PERSON'S CIRCUMSTANCES AND EXPERIENCES THROUGHOUT THE COURT PROCESS. EIGHTY ONE TWO FOUR IS NOW A MUCH MORE MODEST VERSION OF ITS ORIGINAL FORM AND WILL GIVE MANY SURVIVORS A MECHANISM TO SEEK JUSTICE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. LITTLE.

IN FACT WE'RE SEEING THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE RIGHT NOW ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES DUE TO HURRICANE IDA. IN LOUISIANA NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY. CLIMATE CHANGE IS ALSO ACUTELY AFFECTING CALIFORNIA'S COAST IN MORE SUBTLE IN DAMAGING WAYS THROUGH SEA LEVEL RISE. STATE GOVERNMENT AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ONLY IN THE VERY EARLY STAGES OF PLANNING FOR AND ANTICIPATING SEA LEVEL RISE. THE LONGER WE WAIT THE MORE COSTLY THE DAMAGE WILL BE. THIS BILL IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO TAKE A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO ADDRESS C. LEVEL RISE I ASK FOR YOUR I. THOUGHT. SENATOR HERTZBERG. VERY MUCH BUT PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE. TO BOTH SUPPORT THIS MEASURE INDICATED EARLY VOTING FOR. BUT ALSO TO PUT IN CONTEXT HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS. AS WE SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE EAST COAST TODAY OR YESTERDAY IN NEW YORK. WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING LOUISIANA OTHER JOINING STATES. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THIS GLOBE EVERY DAY- THE CHALLENGES WE FACE ARE EXTRAORDINARY AND- WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE ISSUES RELATED TO AIR QUALITY IN THE LIKE AND YET WHEN YOU READ THE STUDIES ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING WITH THE WILDFIRES. IN THE IMPACT THAT THOSE WILDFIRES ARE HAVING NOT JUST HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THE QUALITY AND OTHER ADVERSE. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS IT'S CRITICAL AND SO WE LOOK AT THE PART NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WE FACE IN THE CLIMATE CHANGE PUBLIC POLICY APPROACH THAT WE TAKE. THAT ALL OF THE VARIOUS ISSUES. IT IS OFTEN THINGS LIKE SEA LEVEL RISE THEY DON'T. THAT THE PUBLIC ATTENTION BUT IN MY JUDGMENT AND MY EXPERIENCE OVER MANY DECADES TRAVELING AROUND THIS GLOBE THIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES WE FACE ALONG WITH WILDFIRES THAT THE SENATE. HAS TAKEN PRETTY X. EXTRAORDINARIA TIVITY EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO BUDGET REQUESTS AND OTHER PUBLIC POLICY ENDEAVORS AND I JUST WANT TO GIVE THE HOTEL. IN THE OTHER CO AUTHORS A GREAT DEAL OF CREDIT. FOR THEIR BIG PICTURE VISION AND UNDERSTANDING THE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS WE DEAL IN ADDRESS TODAY AS WE SEEK TO PASS AND I SUPPORT SP ONE. CENTER WHERE CASCADING. EFFECT THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT HI TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE WIN SEVEN- COMMITTEE TWO OF THE BUDGET WAS WORKING ON THE RESOURCES THE CLIMATE INITIATIVE WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN MAKING ARGUMENTS. INCREASE THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE FROM ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION TO THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION AND WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF THE- DISCUSSIONS RIGHT NOW WITH THE BUDGET OF WHAT TO DO BUT THE SENATE PROPOSAL. SET ASIDE ONE POINT ONE BILLION IS THE INITIAL DOWN PAYMENT TO DO THE WORK THAT'S OUTLINED HERE IN SP ONE WE KNOW MY COLLEAGUE WHO REPRESENTS NAPA HAS A BIG PROJECT THERE WOULD. HIGHWAY THIRTY SEVEN WHICH WILL TRANSFORM THE WHOLE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AND ALLOW FOR A CAUSEWAY- TO BE CONSTRUCTED IN TWO FOR WOMEN WE HAVE STORM SURGES LIKE WE SAW DOWN IN LOUISIANA WE HAVE. EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS THAT THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT IS GOING TO RESPOND SO THERE'S PROJECTS IN MY DISTRICT AND PROJECTS UP AND DOWN THE STATE THAT ARE LOOKING TO BE FUNDED AND THIS SETS THE FRAMEWORK. IN LEGISLATION AND HOPEFULLY. WITH THE GOVERNOR SAYS. WHAT IN OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY COOPERATION ON AS WE CAN ROUTE THE LAST. DETAILS OF THE BUDGET THAT WILL GET. OVER A BILLION DOLLARS TO DO THE IMPORTANT WORK THAT'S- ANTICIPATED SP ONE NIGHT URGING A VOTE. SENATOR EDMUND. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE YOU KNOW I REPRESENT- PART CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WE SIT ON THE CALIFORNIA DELTA- AND THEN THE LONGER THE LARGEST FRESHWATER ESTUARY IN IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE AND IF THE SEA LEVEL KEEPS RISING AT THE LEVEL IS RISING RIGHT NOW I AM NOT CO SIDE BUT WE WILL BE AT SOME POINT AND I THINK WE SHOULD ALL BE INCREDIBLY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. MY SPOUSE'S MORNING AS PEOPLE READ THEIR NEWS FEED WHEN IT COMES UP IT'S LIKE BUILDING IN SAN FRANCISCO JUST TILTED TWENTY TWO INCHES THAT'S BECAUSE THIS DOES THE LEVELS RISING AND OUR GROUND IS SHIFTING MEMBERS AGAIN I REPRESENT CENTRAL CALIFORNIA I WANT TO MAINTAIN REPRESENTING CENTRAL CALIFORNIA YOU DO NOT WANT TO REPRESENT% THE COAST AND I STRONGLY URGE. AND I ON SB ONE. AND SPEAKING OF THE COAST SENATOR LARRY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT- WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY I DID ONE OF THE FIRST BILLS ON SEA LEVEL RISE THAT EVER BEEN DONE IN THE LEGISLATURE I GOT RIGHT TO THIS BODY. AND COULDN'T MOVE THE BILL I WANTED TO INCORPORATE INTO GENERAL PLANS THAT PEOPLE WERE TAKEN TO ACCOUNT C. LEVEL RISE IN HALF THE STAKE HOLDER SAID WE DON'T WANT THIS BILL UNLESS YOU GIVE US A REAL BENCHMARK AND THE OTHER HALF OF THE STAKEHOLDER SAID- YOU GIVE US A MATCH MARK WERE AGAINST THE BILL I COULD NOT BRIDGE THAT AND THEN LO AND BEHOLD. A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER I'M APPOINTED NATURAL RESOURCES SECRETARY AND I AM IN CHARGE OF THE SCIENCE THAT ESTABLISHES THE BENCHMARK AND AS WE IN TWENTY ELEVEN ON THE SAME DAY AS THE JAPANESE TSUNAMI. ADOPTED THE SCIENCE IN CALIFORNIA IT BASICALLY SAID THAT WE WOULD BE SOMEWHERE IN TWENTY FIFTY THAT WOULD BE EIGHT INCHES OR SOMETHING SEA LEVEL RISE BUT THAT WAS THE MEDIAN IF WE REALLY COULDN'T ON ARE LOWERING EMISSIONSSHOULD BE LESS IF WE REALLY BAD WOULD BE HIGHER THAN THE NUMBER OF FEET. AT TWENTY ONE HUNDRED AND SO THE THING I ASKED THE SCIENTISTS AT THE TIME AS PEOPLE WERE SKEPTICAL ABOUT LOOKING FOR WORK LET'S LOOK BACKWARD AND THEY SAID SEVEN INCHES IN OUR AREA THE CITY HAS RISEN SINCE THE INDUSTRIAL RUSSELL REVOLUTION. AND SO NOW WE KEEP MOVING AHEAD WITH DIFFERENT THINGS AND WORKED ON THE SCIENCE WE SEEM TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND THIS BILL IS THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP BECAUSE IT BRINGS PEOPLE AROUND ALL OVER THE STATE TO ACTUALLY PLAN TO ACTUALLY DECIDE HOW WERE WE GOING TO BRIDGE IT SO IF YOU LOOK AT SENATOR DODD'S DISTRICT ON THE HIGHWAY THIRTY SEVEN OR IN THAT AREA. IT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DO IF YOU LOOK AT SENATOR AIKMAN'S. DISTRICT A ONE- FORT. ARISE SINCE LEVEL. WOULD CHANGE THE TWO FIVE HUNDRED YEARS. TO A TEN YEAR FLOOD IN THE WESTERN DELTA. SO THESE ARE THINGS WE CAN'T RUN AWAY FROM AND THIS BILL HELPS US IN A WAY THAT THAT WE CAN DO OUR BEST TO BE READY SO I SALUTE THE AUTHORS AND I CALL FOR AN I. PHONE. SENATOR CAN. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT CENTERS I TOO I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SP ONE AND I TO LIKE MY GOOD FRIEND FROM STOCKTON- REPRESENTS NOT A COASTAL REGION BUT SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE INLAND FACT FREE RIGHT HERE AND AS WE SIT HERE DEBATING THIS BILL- PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO GIVE SOME THOUGHT TO EXACTLY HOW MANY FEET WE ARE ABOVE SEA LEVEL. AS WE SIT HERE RIGHT NOW. AND THAT'S WHAT SEA LEVEL RISE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SEA LEVEL RISE WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AND I THINK IT'S MENTIONED BY TO MY COLLEAGUES BEFORE. YOU KNOW ONE FOOT RISE IN SEA LEVEL CERTAINLY IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR THE COAST BUT IT'S ACTUALLY CHALLENGE FOR US RIGHT HERE. YOU KNOW THE TERMS OF FLOOD RISK SO WE USUALLY WORRY ABOUT. FLOODS COMING FROM THE FOOTHILLS GREAT. UNSERE AS COMING DOWN WITH A PINEAPPLE EXPRESS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WELL DON'T FORGET WATER TO BACK UP THE OTHER WAY. A TEN FOOT RISE I THINK WOULD BASICALLY MAKE BOTH. MY GOOD FRIEND FROM STOCKTON AND I REPRESENTING A FAIRLY QUIET X. DISTRICT. SO YES SALTWATER AQUATIC DISTRICT AND- SO. WE NEED TO DEFINITELY ADDRESS THIS EFFECT NOT JUST R. TWO DISTRICTS I THINK MANY OTHER DISTRICTS OF BOTH SEGMENTS SAM KEENE VALLEY START. ARE GONNA BE UNDER WATER. SO WE NEED TO ADDRESS THIS- THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD. I APPRECIATE A LOT FOCUSES ON THE COASTAL COMMISSION AND THINGS ON THE COAST BUT THIS IS ALSO IN INLAND CALIFORNIA PROBLEM. ESPECIALLY. AS WHEN I BUY IT. SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND I TO RISE AND SUPPORTED THANK GOD. THE GOOD SENATOR FROM SAN DIEGO WHO IS WHO CAN VISION DESKSIDE COUPLE YEARS AGO BUT BECAUSE OF THE COLD YET.

COAST AND- HAS SUFFERED SOME SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS- INCLUDING THE DEATHS OF A- FOR MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY THREE MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY DUE TO A CAR. THE COASTAL BLUFF OF COLLAPSE SO IT'S MY WHOLE- WITH THE GROUP THAT COMES TOGETHER THAT ALL. MITIGATIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE WILL BE ENTERTAINED AND AT THAT TIME. WE WILL HAVE THINGS THAT ARE OF SPECIFICALLY TAILOR MADE FOR TAILOR MADE FOR EACH OF THE AREAS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ADDRESSED TODAY- A SPECIFIC MITIGATION THAT MATCHES THE- THE NEEDS IN THOSE PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THERE'S A WIDE ARRAY. AND I GUESS THE WIDE ARRAY OF IDEAS. ON HOW THIS IS TO BE DONE AT ONE THAT IS TROUBLING WHEN IT'S THE ONLY ONE TO BE CONSIDERED AS THE MANAGE RETREATS THAT'S CONTINUALLY DEBATED. IT HAS CERTAINLY ABSOLUTE APPLICATION IN SOME AREAS BUT NOT AT ALL PHIL I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE INTRODUCTION AND THE SUPPORT. ACROSS THE MANY OF THE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE SPOKEN TODAY. AND LOOK FORWARD TO SOME. GOOD THINGS COMING OUT OF THIS THANK YOU. SENATOR CAN. I T. ONE S. THINK ABOUT A PRESIDENT I TOO WANT TO- OUR- PRO TEM FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD VERY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY IN PLACES LIKE LONG BEACH WHICH I REPRESENT- REPORTS HAVE BEEN TWO HUNDRED FORTY ALMOST HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE NEXT TWO DECADES JUST TO PROTECT OUR SEA WALLS IN THE CITY- WE HAVE PLANS IN PLACE I THINK THIS WOULD HELP THEM IMPLEMENT MANY OF THOSE PLANS TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTED ON TOP OF THAT A LOT OF CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS LOCALLY THAT ARE BEING PLANNED NEAR US BASES THAT WILL BE ESSENTIALLY UNDER WATER IN THE NEXT DECADE NOT EVEN TWO DECADES. SO WE NEED TO START PRE PLANNING NOW AND ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ALL STAKE HOLDERS- AT THE AT THE HELLMAN I LOVE THAT THIS CALLS OUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE GROUPS AS WELL AND I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH IT WAS.
