TWENTY THREE FIFTY ONE HAS BEEN PULLED BY THE AUTHOR BUSINESS. YEAH. YEAH. OKAY EVEN THOUGH HE'S. SINCE ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL IS HERE WITH US WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED AS A SUB COMMITTEE LIVING TO FILE I THREE AB TWO. THE OTHER THREE ASSEMBLYMEMBER THURMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. PLEASE PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE OH THREE. THIS IS A BILL THAT SEEKS TO GENERATE NEW REVENUE FOR PROGRAMS LIKE PRESCHOOL AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN OUR STATE. IT RECOGNIZES THAT THERE IS A NEXUS WITH THE HIGH RATE OF INCARCERATION IN OUR STATE IN PARTICULAR. IT TAKES A LOOK AT THE PRACTICE OF USING PRIVATE PRISONS IN OUR STATE. IN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SPENDS ON INCARCERATION SERVICES FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE FOR PROFIT. THIS BILL UP PLACES A TEN PERCENT TAX ALL FOR PRIVATE ON PRIVATE FOR PROFIT PRISON COMPANIES THAT CONTRACT WITH THE STATE. AND PROFIT OFF OF MASS INCARCERATION. A MASS INCARCERATION IS BIG BUSINESS FOR PRIVATE PRISONS BECAUSE CALIFORNIA SPENDS HUGE AMOUNTS TO INCARCERATE PRISONERS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THE ACT OF CONTRACTS FOR FOR POOR PROPER COMPANIES TOTALED FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. IN COMPARISON THE STATE SPENDS RELATIVELY LITTLE ON EARLY EDUCATION AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT WE KNOW WILL PREVENT INCARCERATION IN THE FIRST PLACE. THIS BILL SUPPORTS PROACTIVE INCARCERATION PREVENTION BY RAISING APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE MILLION NEW DOLLARS IN ANNUAL REVENUE FOR PRESCHOOL AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. ATTEMPTS AT REDUCING OUR PRISON POPULATION TYPICALLY FOCUS ON RECIDIVISM OR SENTENCING REDUCTION AND SORT OF ALSO ADDRESSING THE ROOT OF THE SYSTEMIC PRISON PIPELINE. THIS BILL CHANGES THAT TREND PROVIDING CRUCIAL FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS THAT REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN INDIVIDUAL COMING INTO CONTACT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL ADDRESSES CRITICAL FUNDING ISSUES RELATED TO EARLY EDUCATION BY PROVIDING A REVENUE STREAM FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION THAT IS INSULATED FROM THE ANNUAL BUDGET VOLATILITY THAT WE EXPERIENCE. AB TWENTY THREE OH THREE INCLUDES A NUMBER PROTECTIVE MEASURES THAT WILL HELP ENSURE THAT THE COST OF THE TAX IS NOT PASSED. ON TO THE STATE NOW THAT LANGUAGE AND HAS BEEN INCLUDED IS SUCH AS THE FOLLOWING. REQUIRING CONTRACTING COMPANIES TO CERTIFY UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT THE COST IS NOT BEING PASSED ALONG TO THE STATE. OUR CALLS FOR OVERSIGHT AND POTENTIAL AUDIT BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL FINES FOR COMPANIES FOUND BE VIOLATORS FINDS AS WELL THAT ARE DEPOSITED INTO THE FUND FURTHER INCREASING. THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE MONEY FOR INCARCERATION PREVENTION PRIVATE PRISONS. COMPANIES HAVE BEEN REAPING LARGE PROFITS EVEN AS A FACE ACCUSATIONS OF. INMATE MISTREATMENT AND PRISMS MANAGEMENT THERE'S AN ONGOING LAWSUIT OVER IN MAKE CONDITIONS WITH LAWYERS FOR THE ACLU AND THE SOUTHERN POPULAR CENTER. ALLEGING THAT MEDICAL CARE IS SUBSTANDARD AND INMATES ARE OFTEN BEING DENIED FOOD FURTHER LATE LAST YEAR THESE COMPANIES WERE FOUND TO PARTNER WITH RETAILERS TO EXTORT SHOPLIFTERS. INTO TAKING A RE EDUCATION COURSE COSTING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS OR FACE JAIL TIME. THIS BILL MAKES PRIVATE PRISON MANAGEMENT LESS PROFITABLE WHILE GENERATING FUNDS FOR EARLY EDUCATION A WITH ME TODAY THAT TESTIFYING AT EMPHASIS ON THIS BILL. IS AIRING GABLE REPRESENTING FIRST FIVE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR BIBLE. HI AARON GABLE ABOUT FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA THE STATE COMMISSION AS WELL AS A BOARD MEMBER FOR THE PARTNERSHIP FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. AND I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND TO THAT THE COMMITTEE FOR NOT ONLY THINKING ABOUT HOW TO FIND MORE REVENUES FOR THE CRUCIAL LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES OF EARLY LEARNING AN EXPANDED LEARNING. BUT ALSO FOR THIS PRIORITY OF FINDING THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE OPPORTUNITY GAP IN THE FIRST YEARS OF LIFE AND OUR INCARCERATION RATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE BRAIN SCIENCE AND THE CONCLUSIVE NATIONAL RESEARCH OUTLINES WHY AND HOW THE OPPORTUNITY GAP. BECOMES OUR ACHIEVEMENT GAP OR TAKE A TWELVE SCHOOLS REGION IS EXPANDED BY LACK OF OPPORTUNITY INTO A HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT RATES. WHICH ULTIMATELY LEADS TO OUR INCREDIBLE INCARCERATION RATES. CALIFORNIA MUST BEGIN WITH STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS PROVEN BY RESEARCH TO REDUCE THESE INCARCERATION RATES BY GOING UPSTREAM. WE NEED TO INVEST IN HIGH QUALITY CHILDCARE AND PRESCHOOL IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF LIFE WHEN NINETY PERCENT OF THE BRAIN DEVELOPMENTS OCCURRING. IN THE ARCHITECTURE FOR ENTIRE TYRE CHILD'S FUTURE IS AT STAKE. THAT OPPORTUNITY GAP HERE IN CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY MEANS THAT ONLY FOURTEEN PERCENT OF OUR BABIES HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CHILDCARE WHEN EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE BRAIN DEVELOPMENTS OCCURRING. ONLY THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT ARE ELIGIBLE THREE YEAR OLDS HAVE ACCESS TO PRESCHOOL. I WE ALSO NEED TO BE LOOKING AT HOW TO INVEST IN CONTINUE TO EXPAND INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA'S HISTORIC EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS ADDRESSING THE SUMMER LEARNING LOSS. SUMMERLEARNING GAPS AND THE LACK OF ACCESS TO AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS WHICH GIVE CHILDREN A BOTH SAFE AND LEARNING PLACE TO BE. WE SPEND CURRENTLY MORE ON FOR PROFIT PRISONS THAN WE DO ON ALL OF EARLY LEARNING IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S A TREND THAT NEEDS TO STOP. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION TO REALLY HOPE TO CLOSE THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE AS WAS NOTED EARLIER OUR EARLIER IT'S LEARNERS. HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY GAP THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE START AT THE BEGINNING OF THEIR EDUCATIONAL CAREER SAID THAT THEY HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO SUCCEED. SO MANY OF OUR CHILDREN HAVE NOT HAD THOSE OPPORTUNITIES WE BELIEVE THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE WOULD HELP TO PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY SO DEARLY ME. MANAGER MEMBERS BRIAN HOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON AYE MONICA'S AYE ME WITH THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM ASSOCIATION AND MARIN SUPPORT. RYAN BLAKELY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA TAX REFORM ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION LET'S GET A. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS GOOD AFTERNOON DAVID WOLF PARA JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION THAT OPPOSED AB TWENTY THREE A THREE TODAY. MET MEMBERS WERE OBVIOUSLY IN FAVOR OF EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS AND PROTECTING AGAINST STAFF FUTURE RECIDIVISM RATES AND ALL THOSE THINGS BUT. IMPOSING A TAX SOME PRIVATE PRISONS BACK CONTRACT OUT WITH VENDORS IS. INAPPROPRIATE AND POTENTIALLY VERY DAMAGING FOR SMALL BUSINESS. ACCORDING TO THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND MR THURMAN NOTED THIS IT DOES COST A LOT TO HAS AN INMATE IN CALIFORNIA PRISON SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO HOUSE AN INMATE FOR ONE YEAR WHICH IS MORE THAN THE TUITION RIGHT. AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY. IT SEEMS LIKE THAT ALONE SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT RATIONALE TO CONTINUE CONTRACTING OUT MORE SERVICES INSTEAD OF STIFLING ECONOMIC GROWTH BY TAXING IT. AND TAXING ARTS YOU KNOW AGAIN THE MAJORITY OF THESE VENDORS ARE SMALL BUSINESSES. YOU KNOW AND AGAIN MR THURMAN MENTIONED THAT. THE VENDOR WOULD HAVE TO CERTIFY UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY THAT ANY COSTS AS A RESULT OF ATTACKS AND NOT BE PASSED ON TO THE STATE. HOW YOU GONNA PROVE US? NOW WE THE QUESTION I HAVE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO PROVE AND IT'S GOING TO SERVE AS YET ANOTHER DISINCENTIVE FOR THESE VENDORS TO CONTRACT OUT SO FOR THOSE REASONS ASPIRIN OVER. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MR BARREL INTO A CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. WE SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT COMPANIES THAT ARE PROFITING OFF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY. TO HELP TO PREVENT FURTHER INCARCERATION. WE THINK THAT THIS BILLS CREATIVE ITS APPROACH TO PREVENT COSTS AND BEING PASSED ON TO THE STATE. AND RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS A NEXUS BETWEEN. PROGRAMS LIKE PRESCHOOL WHICH PREVENT. YOUNG PEOPLE FROM ENTERING A CAN OF JUSTICE SYSTEM IN THE FIRST PLACE ARE THIS CREATES A NEW REVENUE SOURCE TO HELP GET THEIR. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR THE AYE VOTE OF THIS COMMITTEE. I ONCE WE HAVE A QUORUM WE WILL. THANK YOU. WE NEED. WHAT WERE WE NEED ONE MORE? I THINK YOU AND THIS THIS WILL RECORD THIS SO THE ACTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS RECOMMENDATION. FROM THE CHAIR. BROUGH ONLY HAVE A QUORUM THANK YOU THANK YOU. WELL YOU HAVE ANOTHER WELL I THINK WASTE OF SINGER. OKAY. WE'RE GONNA FILE ITEM SIX AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY. MR VERY WHAT DO I SORRY TO BE SIT NARAL FACT. I WOULD DO THAT WAS SECOND. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY. THE BILL HAS A DIFFERENT A SIMILAR THING. ARE IT LOOKS THAT COMPANIES THAT PROFIT OFF OF PRISON RELATED SERVICES BUT WHEREAS THE LAST BILL WAS FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON PRIVATE PRISON COMPANIES. THIS BILL LOOKS AT ANY COMPANY THAT. UP HAS A PROFIT NOT RELATED. COMPONENT FOR PRISON RELATED SERVICES NOW THIS BILL PROVIDES RESOURCES FOR PRESCHOOL AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. UNLIKE AB TWENTY THREE OH THREE AT IT PLACES A PROGRESSIVE BE ALL FOR PROFIT COMPANIES OTHER THAN PRIVATE PRISON AND HEALTH CONTRACTORS THAT CONTRACT WITH THE STATE. TO PROVIDE GOODS AND SERVICES THE FEE WOULD GENERATE ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TRADING A CONTINUOUS SOURCE OF FUNDING. FOR PRESCHOOL AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS THAT IS NOT DEPENDENT ON ANNUAL BUDGET APPROPRIATION. I WE'RE COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT HARM CALIFORNIA INMATES AND TO THAT END WE RECOGNIZE A CERTAIN CONTRACTS. SPECIFICALLY THOSE INVOLVING HEALTH CARE MUST BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAT IS WHY THIS BILL EXEMPTS HEALTH CONTRACTS FROM THIS FEAT THIS BILL ALSO EXAM CONTRACTS OF ONE MILLION DOLLARS OR LESS. TO ENSURE THAT SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTORS ARE NOT UNDULY IMPACT IT. AND ADDITIONALLY THE BILL WILL INCREASE TRANSPARENCY BY CREATING A PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE DATABASE WERE CONTRACTORS CONTRACT VALUES TANTRIC SUMMARIES. AND ANNUAL CONTRACT PAYOUTS WILL BE LISTED FINALLY AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY INCLUDE THE SAME PROTECTION MEASURES CONTAINED. IN THE PREVIOUS BILL THAT WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT THE COST OF THE TAX IS NOT PASSED ON TO THE STATE. THE BILL ONLY AFFECT THOSE WHO PROFIT FINANCIALLY FROM INDIVIDUALS INCARCERATION AND REMIT THOSE FUNDS TO PROGRAMS THAT WILL REDUCE INCARCERATION. AND PROVIDE FOR A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AYE WITH ME TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IS AND GABLE A FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA JENNIFER BAKER OF CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. RESPECT ESPERANDO. AARON A CABLE ABOUT THE FOR SIDE CALIFORNIA AGAIN IN THE PARTNERSHIP FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH I WANNA. DEFERRED THE COMMENTS I MADE EARLIER SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A STATE INCARCERATION PREVENTION FUND TO LOOK AT THIS NEXUS A RIGHT NOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS BEING. A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE FACE OF WHAT WE SEE IN TERMS OF A LACK OF ACCESS AND EARLY LEARNING EVERY JUST GIVE YOU THE CONTEXT. THAT HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WITH SERVE APPROXIMATELY TWELVE THOUSAND MORE CHILDREN IN PRESCHOOL SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA THAN WE CURRENTLY DO. BY BY CONTEXT WE ONLY CURLY SERVE ABOUT THIRTY THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO TWO IN OUR HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING PROGRAMS OF THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE POTENTIAL THANK YOU. JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO A CO MY PREVIOUS COMMENTS BUT ALSO NOTE THAT IT. ONE OF OUR GUYS STATE COUNCIL MEETINGS THAT WE HAD. OR LAST YEAR WHERE IS THIS. IMPORTER LEE MEETINGS WHERE ARE OUR MEMBERS COME FROM ACROSS THE STATE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT LEGISLATION. OUR MEMBERS WERE PARTICULARLY INTENSE OVER THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO BE ABLE TO SAY HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE SYSTEMICALLY. SO WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP FROM ASSEMBLYMEMBER THURMAN AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS MATTER IN SUPPORT. MANAGER MEMBER BRIAN HA. THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WE APOLOGIZE FOR NOT SUBMITTING AS A LOT OF SUPPORT WILL BE JUST TOOK POSITION ON THE BELGRADE STRONG SUPPORT. OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. HELLO AGAIN. MONICA SEMI WITH THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON. MARTY FISHER ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. WERE HERE IN OPPOSITION. WE AGREE THAT REDUCING INCARCERATION IS A VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY AREA BUT WE DISAGREE WITH THE PROPOSED REVENUE SOURCE. A SET FORTH IN THIS BILL. WE'VE IDENTIFIED IT AS A JOB KILLER. THE BILL UNFAIRLY TARGETS ONE CATEGORY OF TAXPAYERS TO FUND A BENEFIT FOR ALL OF THE STATE BY IMPOSING A TAX OF UP TO TEN PERCENT ON THE CONTRACT PRICE. ON CONTRACTORS FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF DOING BUSINESS WITH THIS AUDIT DEPARTMENT. AND REQUIRES THE CONTRACTOR TO ABSORB THE COST WHILE MAINTAINING A PRICE OF THE LOWEST RESPONSIBLE BIDDER WE DON'T THINK THIS IS THIS IS EVEN POSSIBLE. CONTRACTORS AND VENDORS ARE PLEASED TO DO BUSINESS WITH THE STATE I CAN ATTRIBUTE A PORTION OF THEIR SUCCESS TO THAT RELATIONSHIP. AN ADDED TAX ON TOP OF AN ALREADY RESOURCE INTENSIVE CONTRACTING PROCESS FOR BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA COULD JEOPARDIZE THE VIABILITY OF CONTRACTING WITH US DEPARTMENT. OF COST CAN'T BE CALCULATED INTO THE BIG EQUATION. AN UNDULY BURDENSOME TAX STRUCTURE BUILT IN THE CONTRACTING WILL ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A LOSS TO THE STATE. OF QUALIFIED AND COMPETITIVE BIDDERS AS WELL AS A LOSS OF BUSINESS THE VENDORS THAT THE STATE HAS COME TO RELY ON ITS QUALITY. AND DEPENDABLE WE'VE CONSISTENTLY STATED THAT ANY TAX INCREASE SHOULD BE BROAD BASED AND SHARED BY ALL SO THAT THE FINANCIAL IMPACT IS MITIGATED THESE AND OTHER REASONS FOR POST. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SHOW SHAUN LEWIS OF THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING OVER TWENTY THOUSAND SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS AN ASCETIC CALIFORNIA ALSO IN OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS ALREADY STATED WOULD LIKE TO JUST ADD THREE QUICK POINTS. FIRST WE AGREE THAT THIS BILL I THINK HIS GOOD INTENTIONS BUT UNFORTUNATELY WITH BAD PUBLIC POLICY AYE WE ALSO FULLY SUPPORT THE INTENT IN NEED. TO SUPPORT AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS MORE BROADLY REDUCE RECIDIVISM IN THE STATE BUT WE THINK THIS BILL GOES ABOUT IT THE WRONG WAY. ACTUALLY VIOLATES OUR FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TAXPAYERS OUGHT TO SEEK THE MOST COMPETITIVE LOW COST BIDS OF FOR STATE CONTRACTS BY IMPOSING THIS HEAVY. TEN PERCENT TAX. SECOND OF ALL SPECIFIC TO SMALL BUSINESSES SEEKING TO CONTRACT WITH THE STATE AYE WE THINK THIS BILL UNDERMINES EXISTING. POLICY GOAL OF AWARDING AT LEAST TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL STATE DOLLARS OUT OF STATE CONTRACT DOLLARS TO CERTIFIED SMALL BUSINESSES THAT'S EXISTING POLICY WE THINK TO BE UNDERMINED. I'M BY RAISING THE COST OF ALL THESE CONTRACTS I'M WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO BUILD THIS TAX IN THE COST STRUCTURE ITSELF IT REALLY SPECIFICALLY PUT SMALL BUSINESSES AT A SEVERE DISADVANTAGE. WHEN IT COMES TO COMPETITIVE BIDDING SINCE THEY ALREADY BEEN ON SUCH TIGHT MARGINS AND FINALLY WE JUST MORE BROADLY DISAGREE I THINK WHAT THE GENERAL. CHARACTERIZATION IS OF THESE CONTRACTS AS A PRIVILEGE OR PROFITEERING OUR TO THOSE CONTRACTING WITH THE STATE MOST STATE AGENCIES FAR BEYOND CDC ARE. LEGITIMATELY NEED CERTAIN GOODS AND SERVICES. CONTRACTED OUT THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEMSELVES. OR EVEN IF THEY ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE THESE CONTRACTS ARE SERVICES OTHER MAYBE WAYS TO CUT COSTS AND SAVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS BY CONTRACTING ESPECIALLY WITH A SMALL BUSINESS WE THINK. THAT THAT IT'S JUST BAD POLICY. WITHIN THIS BILL WHEN IT COMES TO THE NEGATIVE CHARACTERIZATION AYE WE BELIEVE THESE CONTRACTS ARE ACTUALLY A WIN WIN FOR TAXPAYERS AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISE WHICH WE DO MORE TO ENCOURAGE IS PRACTICE. NOT PENALIZE IT WITH THIS TEN PERCENT TAX WE ASK YOU KNOW VOTE. ANY MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS DAVID WOLFE OUR JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION FOR REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED IN MY PRIOR TESTIMONY ASPIRIN ABOUT. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. DOCTOR QUIRK OF. SO WE ALREADY HAVE A BILL OF BOXES BILL FROM A YEAR TO GO WHICH SAYS WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE CONTRACTING WITH PRISON THAT PRIVATE PRISONS. WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO BRING THIS BILL UP NOW? THANKS FOR THE QUESTION IS ARE NOT REQUIRED AND I WILL CLARIFY THAT THIS BILL IS NOT THE ONE ABOUT PRIVATE PRISONS LE A BLIND NO BUT I WAS IN HERE FOR THE PRIVATE DOZEN ONE BUT THIS DEALS WITH PEOPLE. TELLING TO PRIVATE PRISONS. SO WE'RE NOT EXPECTING TO HAVE ANY. SO WHY BRING THE BILL UP. WELL ON AB TWENTY THREE OH THREE WHICH DEALS EXCLUSIVELY A PRIVATE PRISONS WE SIMPLY ARE SAYING IF THE STATE IS GOING TO CONTRACT WITH PRIVATE PRISONS. THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MUCH NEEDED REVENUE TO SUPPORT PREVENTION PROGRAMS AND UNTIL THERE ARENO PRIVATE PRISONS WE BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD BE IN FACT POLICY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. OKAY BUT THEN. AYE KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SAID THAT THE PRISONS HAVE TO PAY. ARM. ONCE THERE'S A CONTRACT RENEWAL. I'M SURE THE PRICE OF THAT WILL GO UP. BECAUSE THEY SEE THEIR EXPENSES GOING OUT BOTH FOR THE PEOPLE YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT IN THIS SPELL THE ACTOR. PEOPLE THEY CONTRACT WITH. YOU KNOW WINDOWS CONTRACTS WILL BE RENEWED IN THERE FOR THE PRICES WILL GO UP. YOU KNOW THEY ARE MULTI YEAR CONTRACTS. BY MOST ESTIMATES TWENTY NINETEEN IS WHEN THERE WOULD BE NEW CONTRACT CONVERSATIONS. IS CERTAINLY WILL BE INCUMBENT ON OUR STATE AGENCIES TO MONITOR THEIR ANY ON PRICING CHANGES IN A PRIOR TO THOSE DATES. ON IN IF THERE WAS SOME SIGNIFICANT BOOST IN COSTS AT THE TIME OF A NEW CONTRACT IT WILL BE UP TO THE STATE TO DETERMINE IF THAT WAS A REASONABLE INCREASE. OFFER THE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED. WELL I MEAN THEY CAN SAY WE GOT TO PAY TEN PERCENT MORE AND PLUS THE CONTRA BUTTON THAT BE CONSIDERED. A REASONABLE. COST BY THE STATE I DON'T KNOW I'VE. JUST ASKING. BUT I THINK WE'RE SAYING THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO MAKE A STATEMENT OF ITS VALUES AND THAT IF THE STATE IS SPENDING FOUR AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS IN. ON A SERVICE THAT LARGELY I HAS A NEGATIVE OUTCOME ON CALIFORNIA CITIZENS. INCLUDING WHAT THE TAXPAYERS PAY WHY SHOULD THE TAXPAYERS ALSO EXPERIENCE SOME BENEFIT BY HAVING REVENUE THAT IS CREATED TO HELP PREVENT. AND ULTIMATELY. CHRIS THE NOT ACROSS ORATION THAT CALIFORNIANS PAY FOR OUR STATE WHAT THE CONCERN THERE IS JUST THAT IT'S GOING TO COST THE STATE MONEY. COMING FROM ONE PRODUCT POCKET THEN YOU'RE PUTTING ANOTHER. BECAUSE I GET NOW I DON'T THINK A PRISONS GONNA STAY OPEN IF IT'S LOSING MONEY. AND UNDER YOUR BILL THAT WOULD BE LOSING MONEY IF IT HAD TO PAY ALL THESE FEES. SO THAT THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. WELL THESE COMPANIES OPERATE IN MULTIPLE STATES AND JURISDICTIONS IN THEY ARE HIGHLY PROFITABLE AND SO IT'S QUESTIONABLE THAT THEY'RE LOSING MONEY EVEN IN THE FACE. OF PAYING AN ADDITIONAL FEE THE FUN CERTAIN SERVICES THAT HAVE A NEXUS TO WHAT THEY DO THESE COMPANIES REMAIN HIGHLY PROFITABLE. AND I BELIEVE. THE CALIFORNIA WOULD MAKE IN THE RIGHT STATEMENT BY SAYING. THERE'S AN EXPECTATION THAT THESE COMPANIES WILL CONTRIBUTE TO SOMETHING THAT WILL ULTIMATELY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF INCARCERATION OUR STATE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SOME OF OUR VOEPEL. AS I AM SOME OF THE OTHER OPPOSITION PEOPLE HAVE SAID THIS UP I SEE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. AND IT'S GOOD. AND IT'S IT'S HONORABLE TRYING TO GET MORE MONEY. TO CHILDREN. TO. HELP AMOUNT AND MAKE SURE THEY. DON'T END UP GOING DOWN A BAD PATH GOT IT. I HAVE THE COUPLE. ANGLES ON IS AND ONE IS RIGHT NOW PROP NINETY EIGHT IS FULLY FUNDED. AND THE QUE. THROUGH TWELVE. MANY OF THE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS ARE FULLY FUNDED. AND. THEY'RE OPERATING ON THEIR HITTING ON ALL CYLINDERS IT'S ACTUALLY THE PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW ARE DOING VERY WELL. M. THEY'RE FULLY FUNDED SO THAT'S THAT ONE YOU KNOW THE THING IS. WHAT? DOUBLE WOULD BEEN APPEAR YEAR MAYBE A LITTLE BIT MORE. WHAT I'VE BEEN WATCHING IS LAYER AFTER LAYER AFTER LAYER AFTER LAYER OF TAXES BEING ADDED ON? TO EVERYTHING I CAN'T THINK OF ANY CATEGORY WE DON'T TAX A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND IT'S ALL CUMULATIVE. AND. THIS PARTICULAR TAX. IS. AS WELL MEANT IS IT IS. WILL. STIFLE. ANY VENDOR I MADE MY LIVING FOR MANY YEARS PROVIDING THE HIGHEST VALUE. FOR THE LOWEST PRICE POSSIBLE. AND IF I'M NOT ALLOWED. TO. FACTOR IN A TEN PERCENT TAX BECAUSE. THE LANGUAGE IS VERY CLEAR. IF I RAISE MY PRICE TEN PERCENT TO COVER MY COST OF THE TAX. THEN I CAN BE PERSECUTED PROSECUTED EVERY WHICH WAY. SO. THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT. FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR TO RESPOND TO THIS PARTICULAR TAX SO THOSE ARE MY TWO MAIN POINTS. JUST SO YOU KNOW. WHAT IT RESPONDS YES THANK YOU THROUGH THE CHAIR? YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR CONCERNS AND THAT YOU'VE ARTICULATED. AT THE TOP AS YOU TALKED ABOUT PROP NINETY EIGHT HOW EDUCATION IS FUNDED. ARE CURRENT. FUNDING FORMULA SEES US FUNDED IN THE STATE SOMEWHERE AROUND FORTY SIX IN THE NATION IN PER PUPIL SPENDING. IN CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY. MUCH LOWER. AT LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT AND IN PRESCHOOL ACTIVITY OF THAT WE WOULD HOPE FOR AND I BELIEVE THAT MISS CABLE CAN SPEAK TO WHERE WE RANK ARE WHERE WE ARE IN OUR PARTICIPATION RATES BUT THEY'RE MUCH LOWER. THAN NEEDED AND HOPE FOR THE STATE. JUST TO CLARIFY BECAUSE I I THINK IT'S WONDERFUL AS A MEMBER TO HEAR THAT YOU THINK ARE PRESCHOOL FIRMS ARE DOING WELL BECAUSE THEY DO SERVE WEALTHY CHILDREN WHO WERE ABLE TO BE IN THE PROGRAM. WE CURRENTLY ONLY SERVE SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT OF ELIGIBLE FOR YOUR ROLES DESPITE THE STATE'S GOAL TO SERVE ALL ELIGIBLE FOR YOUR OLDER THAT'S BASED OFF OF INCOME. AND WORKING STATUS OF THE PARENTS WE I'M CURRENTLY ONLY SERVED THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF ELIGIBLE THREE YEAR OLDS AND A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND SO THAT WE DO HAVE VERY LOW PARTICIPATION RATES. NOT BASED OFF OF INTEREST BUT BASS OFF OF THE FUNDING AVAILABLE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. STILL I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS MYSELF. FIRST ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE WHERE WE REVIEWED NOTHING BUT TAX OVERTAXED OVER TAXES YOU'RE GOING TO SEAL A LOT OF TAXES HERE. I NOTICED THAT EVERYONE IN THE ROOM WANTS TO SAY THAT THEY WANT TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM BUT NO WANTS TO PAY FOR IT. CLEARLY I REPRESENT A COMMITTEE WHERE THIS IS AN ISSUE AND HOW WE AND ONE OF THE BEST WAYS IS IS THROUGH EARLY EDUCATION I HAVE A THREE YEAR OLDS. THE FACT THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THREE YEAR OLDS ARE ALLOWED ACCESS. TO TO. EDUCATION IS INSANE TO ME THAT SIXTY PERCENT OF WHERE MY DAUGHTER MOVES TO NEXT WOULD BE WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR HER. IS UNACCEPTABLE TO ME I DO HAVE ONE QUESTION WITH THIS ARE EITHER BILL MAKE PREP PRISONS NON PROFITABLE FOR PRIVATE PRISONS. TEN PERCENT WOULD THAT MAKE IT EITHER PREP WOULD THAT MAKE IT NOT PROFITABLE I'D I DO NOT THINK SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RATE OF PROFITABILITY FOR. THE COMPANIES THAT OWN PRIVATE PRISONS IT IS SIGNIFICANT AND GROWING AND. I DO NOT THINK SO. IT IS NOT FOR ME TO DETERMINE WHAT THEIR PROFITABILITY IS BUT I WOULD ONLY ILLUSTRATE THAT THE PROFITABILITY IS SIGNIFICANT AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU AND IN Y OPINION CAPITALISM IS THE HIGHEST VALUE FOR THE LOWEST COSTS TENDS TO BE SO WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE CLOSE. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WOULD ONLY SAY THIS ABOUT SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE FROM OPPOSITION. ABOUT THIS BILL DISADVANTAGING SMALL BUSINESS WE'VE ACTUALLY TAKEN GREAT PAINS TO PROTECT SMALL BUSINESS BY EXEMPTING ANY BUSINESS WHOSE. GROSS RECEIPTS ARE BELOW ONE MILLION DOLLARS. WIT WE UNDERSTAND. THAT THERE ARE ISSUES AROUND TAXATION. CALIFORNIA IS A STATE THAT NEEDS REVENUE. AND CALIFORNIA IS A STATE THAT HAS SAID NO NEW PROGRAMS WITHOUT ANY REVENUE. AND SO WE'VE TAKEN THAT TO HEART AND WE'RE TRYING OUR BEST TO STEWART THE PUBLIC RESOURCES AT OUR CITIZENS PROVIDE US. AND I THINK THIS PROVIDES THE MOST IMPACT OF FOR THE VALUE THAT WE WILL GET FOR STUDENTS AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN OUR STATE OF RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. FOR AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY AND AB TWENTY THREE OH THREE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BERMAN WE HAVE A QUORUM WE WILL VOTE THIS RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. WELL IN A FILE ITEM FIVE AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY SEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOPER WOULD YOU LIKE TO OPEN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS A STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE U. S. SECRET SERVICE IN THE US DEPARTMENT EDUCATION SHOW THAT EIGHTY ONE PERCENT OF SCHOOL SHOOTINGS. AT LEAST ONE OTHER PERSON BESIDES THE SHOOTER HAD INFORMATION ABOUT THE ATTACK. AB TWENTY FOUR NINETY SEVEN THE SCHOOL VIOLENCE. IS EXCUSE ME THE SCHOOL GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION ACT WILL PUT IN PLACE THE PROPER PERSONNEL. THE PROPER PROCEDURE SO THAT CRITICAL INFORMATION WILL NOT BE IGNORED. BUT ACTED UPON. AB TWENTY FOUR NIGHTS SEVEN WOULD POSE AN EXERCISE IN SELF TAX ON ALL FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION CELLS. THE REVENUE FROM ATTACKS MADE AVAILABLE TO. ALL MIDDLE SCHOOL TO HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELOR AND ALL HIGH SCHOOL TO HIGH SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER. IT'S CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE THE PROGRAM. IT BETWEEN FOR NINETY SEVEN WILL ALSO ALLOW THE PUBLIC JUSTICE TO FLAG INDIVIDUALS WHO IDENTIFIED IN THE PLANNING OF A SCHOOL SHOOTING SLEW ARE NOT PERMITTED TO PURCHASE ANY FIREARMS. IT WILL ALSO PLEASE PENALTIES ON THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO MAKE THEIR OWN NOT REPORTED FIRE ARMS WITH THE INTENT TO RESELL. AB TWENTY FOUR NINE SEVEN PLACES PERSONNEL IN MIDDLE SCHOOLS WERE THE FIRST SIGNS STUDENTS IN DISTRESS MANIFEST THEMSELVES IN PLACES OFFERS A HIGH SCHOOLS TO ADDRESS INSTANCE OF ACTIVE SHOOTERS. I RESPECTFULLY ACCEPT CHAIRS RECKON AMID AMENDMENTS. THAT MARCH FIFTH WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WHEN IS IT IN OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS ABOUT. HERE THEY COME. GOOD AFTERNOON. CATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA. VERY BRIEFLY WE DO NOT WE TAKE NO POSITION ON THE PORTION OF THE BILL THAT PER THAT PROPOSALS AND USE TAX ON SALES OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION. BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE WAY TO SPEND THAT MONEY IS ON MORE POLICE IN SCHOOLS. AND ANEW KIND OF SCHOOL COUNSELOR FOR MIDDLE SCHOOLS. FOR MANY STUDENTS UP PRESENCE OF A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER MAKES SCHOOL FEEL LESS SAFE. THEY'RE OFF ALL TOO OFTEN USED TO ASSIST WITH WHAT WHAT SHOULD BE ROUTINE DISCIPLINARY MATTERS AND ALL TOO OFTEN THOSE INTERACTIONS HAVE TURNED INTO A BOMB EXCESSIVE USE OF FORCE AGAINST STUDENTS. YOUNG PEOPLE COME TO FEEL THAT THEY'RE TREATED AS SUSPECTS RATHER THAN STUDENTS AND WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO REDUCE THE PRESENCE OF POLICE IN OUR SCHOOLS RATHER THAN INCREASE AT. I IN GENERAL WE THINK THAT THAT COUNSELORS MORE COUNSELORS IN SCHOOLS IS A BETTER APPROACH TO CREATING SAFER SCHOOLS. UP BUT THE LANGUAGE DESCRIBING THE ROLE OF THE COUNSELOR IN THIS BILL IS SOMEWHAT DISTURBING. RATHER THAN BEING TRADITIONAL SCHOOL COUNSELORS WHO WHO PROVIDE HELP ON A RANGE OF ISSUES THAT ARISE ACADEMIC AND OTHERWISE FOR STUDENTS. THESE COUNSELORS ARE DEFINED AS. HAVING THEIR PRIMARY ROLE IS DETECTING IN REPORTING THE EARLY WARNING SIGNS OF THREATS OF VIOLENCE TO THE SCHOOL OR ITS PUPILS. TO US THAT SOUNDS A LOT MORE LIKE SURVEILLANCE THAN IT DOES. I BREAK TRADITIONAL COUNSELLING. AND WE ASK FOR AN OF. JUST TO BE CLEAR LET'S RUN THROUGH THEM EMMETT SO THAT SO THAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT. THE AUTHOR HAS AGREED TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AND SEND SOME OF THE COMMENTS MAY BE ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS AND HE'S ACCEPTED TO TAKE LET'S GO THROUGH THEM REALLY QUICKLY. THE FIRST ONE IS DELETE SCHOOL COUNSELOR FROM THIS BILL'S PROVISION I'M MANDATE REPORTERS DELETE DELETE SECTION FOUR OF THE BILL WHICH PROVIDES A NEW EXCEPTION TO THE CONFIDENTIALITY RULES GOVERNING SCHOOL COUNSELORS. DELETE LANGUAGE IN SECTION FIVE STAY IN THAT SCHOOL COUNSELORS WILL BE PRIMARILY CHARGED WITH DETECTING REPORTING THE EARLY WARNING SIGNS OF VIOLENCE. PROVIDE THE NEW COUNSELORS FUNDING SHALL BE USED TO SUPPLEMENT ARE NOT SUPPLANT EXISTING FUNDING FOR COUNSELORS AND TO ADOPT TECHNICAL MOMENTS NOTED INCOME IN EACH OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. SO TO BE CLEAR THERE HAS BEEN AND I'VE SPENT TWO NIGHTS CONCERNS NOT HAVING REVIEWED. I WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION CONTINUE. UPMANTRA MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CRADLE IS ABOUT FOR THE FIVE POLICY COALITION THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FEDERAL FIREARMS LICENSEES. I'M. ON ON MANY LEVELS THIS BILL IS TROUBLING FIRST RELATING TO JUST THE ISSUES OF THE THE INCREASED POTENTIAL CRIMINAL LIABILITIES. TO MANDATE A REPORTERS OF THE THE DEFINITIONS OF WHAT IS A THREAT ARE SO HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE I IN THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE AND IT WOULD BE WOULD OPEN UP THOSE MANDATED REPORTERS TO. POTENTIAL JAIL TIME AS WELL AS FINES. OF. BUT ONCE AGAIN DID THOSE ARE MORE RELATING TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES IN REGARDS TO A TAXATION ISSUE AND AND SOMETHING WAS BROUGHT UP WITH WITH ANOTHER BILL. EVERYONE WANTS AND AND LOVE SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS AYE WE BELIEVE I'M A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I BELIEVE IN IN IN TOWNS SCHOOL COUNSELORS. I BELIEVE IN MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE SAFE THE QUESTION COMES DOWN IS WHO IS GOING TO PAY FOR IT. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE ARE TARGETING ONE GROUP OF LAW ABIDING CITIZENS WHO SEEK NOTHING MORE THAT TO EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS IF WE WERE TO TAX VOTERS IN ORDER TO FIGHT VOTER FRAUD. IF WE WERE TO BACK TAX THOSE WHO WERE DESIRING TO GET MARRIED ADDITIONALLY IN ORDER TO PAY FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE A THESE ARE THINGS THAT PEOPLE WOULD BASICALLY SAY WOULD FIND. A TO BE APPOINT THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT THIS IS A REGRESSIVE TAX IT IS ALREADY EXPENSIVE TO BE A GUN OWNER IN THE STATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NOW WE'RE GOING TO DRASTICALLY INCREASE THE COST OF AN INDIVIDUAL TO BE ABLE TO TO OWN USE OR BECOME PROFICIENT IN THE USE OF A FIREARM. IN PARTICULAR IN THE CASE WHERE SOMEONE SEEKING TO USE IT TO DEFEND THEMSELVES YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE IT COST PROHIBITIVE SO THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE WHO ARE LIKELY IN LOW INCOME HIGH CRIME AREAS. ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THEIR. NATIONAL RIGHTS IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT WE KNOW FROM JURISPRUDENCE IN THE AREA OF THE SECOND SECOND AMENDMENT AND ALSO THE RIGHTS THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO. TO. UNDULY BURDEN INDIVIDUALS WHO SEEK TO EXERCISE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS WITHOUT SOME DIRECT NEXUS NOW UNLESS THE SCHOOL COUNSELORS ONCE AGAIN ARE GOING TO BE DIRECTLY ONLY DEALING WITH INCIDENCES RELATING TO. RELATING TO POTENTIAL. FIREARM USE ON CAMPUS OR THESE OFFICERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE PUT ON CAMPUS ARE ONLY GOING TO DEAL WITH SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS AN ACTIVE SHOOTER OR THERE'S A FIREARM ON CAMPUS. I'M FINDING IT VERY DIFFICULT TO SEE WHERE THERE IS A DIRECT NEXUS HERE THIS BILL IS FRAUGHT WITH CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEMS AND THAT WE BELIEVE FOR THAT REASON. WE'RE ASKING YOU TO VOTE NO ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK HILL AYE GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CATHOLIC REPRESENTING THE NATIONAL SHOOTING SPORTS FOUNDATION. I REPRESENTING THE FIREARMS INDUSTRY AMMUNITION MANUFACTURES WELL SAFARI CLUB INTERNATIONAL OUTDOOR SPORTS TEAMS COALITION CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA SPORTSMEN'S LOBBY. IN OPPOSITION. TO THE BILL ALL. WE KIND OF SHARE WE SHARE THE COMMENTS OF ACTUALLY THE TWO PRIOR WITNESSES. CERTAINLY THIS IS WELL INTENTIONED AND THAT WE ALL ARE TRYING TO SEEK SOLUTIONS FOR OUR SCHOOL VIOLENCE BE AND SCHOOL VIOLENCE EXTENDS BEYOND OF FIREARMS I THINK THAT GETS LOST SOMETIMES. AND I THINK THAT THE SOLUTION NEEDS TO COME FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC CAN CERTAINLY. OUR INDUSTRY STANDS READY TO TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN A BROADER BASED APPROACH HOWEVER TAXING THE INDUSTRY IT'S MISTER DELEUZE'S POINTED OUT. YOU'RE BASICALLY MAKING. OUR CITIZENS THAT CHOOSE TO CARRY FIREARMS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES FOR HUNTING AND SHOOTING. PAY THE BURDEN FOR ALL SCHOOL SAFETY AND IT SEEMS TO ME IT'S GOT TO HAVE A GENERAL PUBLIC. SOLUTION. WE DO SUPPORT ON NOT ONLY THE RESOURCE OFFICER'S BUT AS WELL AS THE COUNSELORS WE THINK IT AND WE KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR IS VERY COMMITTED TO. JUVENILES AND TWO SCHOOL EDUCATION SO WE SUPPORT WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR BUT NOT THIS BILL. THE OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS THAT. THIS IS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES YOU NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT ALL THE FIREARMS LAWS THAT YOU HAVE ON THE BOOKS CURRENTLY. A LOT OF THE TAXATION AND WE HAD A NON LEAD AMMUNITION BILL GOING EFFECT THAT'S GOING TO COST THE STATE FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS. AND IT'S ALSO GONNA HAVE DECREASED REVENUE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESOURCE ISSUES AND AND YOU HAVE THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE STRUGGLING VERY MUCH WITH THE ARM PROHIBITED PERSONS PROGRAM WHICH THEY'VE HAD NUMEROUS DOLLARS STRONACH. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU NEED TO PRIORITIZE. WHERE YOU WANT TO FOCUS IN THE FIREARMS HEARING ON THIS JUST SEEMS LIKE THE WRONG APPROACH THANK YOU? MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS SAMPRAS REPRESENTING GUN OWNERS CALIFORNIA WE GOT A COUPLE OF. OF A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN SIGN MAYBE IN A DIFFERENT. VIEW. AS MY COLLEAGUES HERE BUT. THAT THIS BILL SEEMS TO. AS MUCH AS THE AUTHOR TRIES NOT TO ASSIGN BLAME ON LAW ABIDING CITIZENS FOR. SOMEHOW BEING THE DIRECT RESULT OF OF GUN VIOLENCE IN SCHOOL. AND AND THAT CANNOT BE ANY CLOSER. IF THEY CANNOT BE TRUTH IT IT'S. IT'S JUST NOT TRUE. IT'S JUST NOT TRUE ARE SO TAXING LAW ABIDING CITIZENS. BECAUSE OF THE. THE CRIMES COMMITTED BY A VERY FEW PEOPLE WE THINK IS IS A COMPLETELY. THE WRONG WAY TO GO. ALSO IN IN LISTENING TO THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS ON HIS BILL. IN IN MEDIA REPORTS SAY HE. YOU KNOW HE TALKS ABOUT THE THE THE THE NEED FOR SCHOOL SAFETY AND HOW. ARMING TEACHERS IS THE WRONG APPROACH. A VERY RECENT A SURVEY. NATIONWIDE SURVEY INCLUDED CALIFORNIA TEACHERS FOUND THAT. AS MANY AS TWENTY PERCENT OF TEACHERS. WOULD BE WILLING TO CARRY OF FIREARMS. ON CAMPUS LEGALLY WITH TRAINING. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES AND THEIR STUDENTS. AS A MATTER OF FACT I DON'T OF THE AUTHORS AWARE THAT THAT WAS A VERY VIABLE PROGRAM THAT DID NOT NEED SUPPORT FROM ATTACKS LIKE THIS. RIGHT HERE IN A IN A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT HAD BEEN IN PLACE FOR A LONG TIME. WHERE UNBEKNOWNST ANYBODY EXCEPT THE ADMINISTRATOR AND THE PERSON WHO HAD A PERMIT? AND WAS TRAINED BY IN COOPERATION WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND. AND IN IT TO AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION IMMEDIATELY. THAT WAS GOING ON IT DIDN'T NEED THIS TAX AND OF THAT OF COURSE A. THE RIGHT TO DO THAT WAS STRIPPED AWAY BY ANOTHER BILL AND AND NOW HERE WE ARE. TRYING TO YOU KNOW. CONSIDER BILL THAT'S GOING TO RAISE TAXES IN ORDER TO PAY FOR ON ON CAMPUS. ARMED GUARDS IN AND. YOU KNOW. MORE COUNSELORS WHAT WE'RE GOING THE WRONG WAY GOING THE WRONG WAY HERE SO. FOR THIS REASON AND OTHERS GUN OWNERS CALIFORNIA IS UNALTERABLY OPPOSED TO THIS TAX. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. THEN READ ON BEHALF NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION'S EUROPEAN STRONG OPPOSITION THANK YOU CAN. YOUR APPROVAL BURGER MAY HAVE A CALIFORNIA WATER FELL. IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. DOCTOR BURKE. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COUNSELORS WILL NO LONGER BE ASKED TO BE REPORTERS THAT'S GOOD. HOW WOULD THE MONEY BE DIVIDED BETWEEN RESOURCE OFFICERS AND COUNSELORS GOES COUNSELORS FIRST LAW SCHOOLS WHEN THEY HAD CUT BACKS THE CUT COUNSELORS FIRST THAT WE'VE BEEN A BIG ISSUE? AND WILL MAKE SHOES KIDS GET HELP BECAUSE LOVES KIDS. TWO I'M TALKING EDUCATORS THEY COMPLAIN THAT THE KIDS THAT ARE HAVING PROBLEMS THEY'RE HAVING DIFFICULTIES AT HOME ARE BEING BULLIED. SO OBVIOUSLY. SCHOOL BECAUSE OF THE BEEN CUT A LOT OF SCHOOLS HAVE. SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS ALREADY MUSTER LARGE DISTRICTS. HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS DRUG CALIFORNIA ARE EMPLOYED SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS IT'S THE MONEY WOULD FIRST GO TOWARDS COUNSELORS. OUT IT INDICATES A PLANET THEN OBVIOUSLY THEY CAN ADD ADDITIONAL COUNSELORS OF STE HAVE COUNCILS ALREADY YOU CAN ADDITIONAL COUNTS REGIONAL SCHOOLS. AS FAR AS REACHED SCHOOL RESOURCE AUTHORS YOU CANNOT ADD ADDITIONAL SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS. SO THIS IS THEY DON'T HAVE THEM. IE SOME SMALL DISTRICTS WOULD BE ABLE WHO EMPLOY SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS AND ONE SINGLE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS. BEEN AROUND FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS PUBLIC LONGER THAN THAT NOW. OKAY THANK YOU. WE HAVE A QUORUM SO. WHILE WE HAVE IT LET'S TAKE ADVANTAGE. MS HYLAND WILL CALL THE ROLL. BURKE. HERE. WHO GROWTH HERE BONTA CHIU? GRAY HERE. MCCARTY MELENDEZ MULLIN. QUIRK. VOEPEL YOU. WE HAVE A QUORUM ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING HEARING NONE WHICH I'D CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM MADAM CHAIR. IS NOT TOO OFTEN YOU GET THE ACLU IN THE GUN RIGHTS FOLKS THE SAME SIDE. BUT WERE NOT TRYING TO BREAK THE BANK HERE. AND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT COME WE DO TALK TO BE DO TAX LAW ABIDING CITIZENS TIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO KEEP US SAFE. THAT GOES ON RIGHT NOW. THE SCHOOL SHE HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES NOW WE TRIED A LOT OF THINGS I DON'T BELIEVE. GUN PER PROHIBITIONS IS THE ANSWER TO THIS SO WE'RE TRYING SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO ACTUALLY SAVE OUR KIDS. AFTER ALL SPEAKERS HERE KNOWN AND WORKED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT SPENT THIRTY YEARS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT I WAS THE CAPTAIN I COMMITTED SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS. I TAUGHT IN THE SCHOOLS PREVENTION PROGRAMS LIKE THIS. WE TOOK GUNS OFF KIDS THAT ARE BRINGING GUNS ON CAMPUS TO DO VIOLENCE SO I THINK MY EXPERTISE IN DEALING WITH THESE PROBLEMS FAR OUTWEIGHS OUR PANEL SPEAKERS. WHO HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR OPINIONS WHICH ARE JUST THAT? THIS IS SOMETHING NEW AND SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AND IN TALKING TO TEACHERS IT IS EASY TO PICK UP THOSE KIDS ARE TO BE PROBLEMATIC AND TO REALLY HELP THEM. EXISTING IN ONE OF MY SCHOOLS DISTRICTS DOWN AND ENGULFED. FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS THEY HAVE A SCHOOL COUNSELOR. AND A LICENSED SOCIAL WORKER ON CAMPUS BIG WHAT DO HOME VISITS TO THE PROBLEM CHILDREN THAT REALLY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE BUT MOST SCHOOLS CAN AFFORD THAT. SO THE SOMETHING OUT OF THE BOX AT THE ORDINARY TO DEFY THOSE KIDS THERE TROUBLE. AND TO HELP THEM. NOT TO PUT IMAGE EL NOT TO REST AND TO HELP THEM. AND HELP IN WHATEVER WAY WE CAN BE THEIR HOME WHERE MAYBE TO MENTAL HEALTH AND CHANGE THE DYNAMIC ON THIS WITH THESE KIDS ARE SCHOOL SHOOTERS BECAUSE LIKE I SAID EARLIER THE STATISTICS. PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT IT ALREADY SO WE TRY TO CHANGE THIS AND I'M A GUN OWNER I HAVE A LOT OF GUNS AT HOME I BELIEVE IN GUN RIGHTS. IS THE TAX AND WE'RE GONNA FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING TO BE BUT ANYTHING THAT CAN HELP PREVENT A SCHOOL SHOOTING HELP A CHILD. THE MONEY WE SAVE IN THE TREASURY SAVE.

ELECTRONIC FUND TRANSFER PAYMENTS OVER TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR CULTIVATION AN EXCISE TAXES ON BOTH MEDICAL AND DON'T USE CANNABIS AND FOR SALES AND USE TAXES. ON ADULT USE CANNABIS IT BUILDS ON A BILL THAT WE PASSED AND HERE IN THIS LET IN THIS LEGISLATURE BEFORE AND TWENTY SIXTEEN WE PASSED AB EIGHT TWENTY ONE BY MISTER GIPSON. HOW OF THAT MEASURE ONLY APPLY THE SALES AND USE TAXES ON MEDICAL CANNABIS SO? THIS BILL AB SEVENTEEN FORTY ONE WILL WILL APPLY TO THE WHOLE GAMUT OF CANNABIS TAXES. CULTIVATION EXCISE MEDICAL AND ADULT USE. AND AND SALES AND USE TAX ON ADULT USE CANNABIS. I WE ARE NO FEDERAL LAW CURRENTLY CLASSIFIES CANNABIS AS A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG WHICH MAKES. IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR THOSE IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY TO BANK OR USE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. AND SO MOST CANNABIS BUSINESSES HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO OPERATE AND PAY TAXES AND CASH IS THAT'S THE ONLY WAY THAT THEY CAN PAY THEIR TAXES. I WOULD THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO PENALIZE THEM FOR DOING SO WE WOULD YOU WANT IN THE PAY THEIR TAXES AND BY REMOVING THIS PENALTY I THINK WOULD ENCOURAGE COMPLIANCE AND I'M MORE TAX REVENUE FOR THE STATE. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU FOR THE CONSIDERATION. AND NOT. I HAVE WITH ME HE. CASEY O'CONNOR A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE OFFICE OF.

BY MAKING PAYMENTS AND CASH ESPECIALLY WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS MADE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BANK THE INDUSTRY'S PREVIOUSLY STATED.

AB TWENTY NINETY SIX WOULD HELP ACHIEVE THIS GOAL BY AUTHORIZING THE ADDITION OF THE DONATE LIFE CALIFORNIA VOLUNTARY TAX CUT CONTRIBUTION FUND. AS A VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION CONTRIBUTION FUND ON THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX RETURN. FOR OVER A DECADE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS PRIORITIZE IMPORTANCE OF INCREASING THE NUMBER OF REGISTERED ORGAN AYE AYE. AND TISSUE DOORS IN THE STATE. AB TWENTY NINETY SIX WE WILL REINFORCE THE STATE'S COMMITMENT BY GIVING CAO GETTING CALIFORNIANS. THE OPPORTUNITY EACH YEAR TO SUPPORT THE REGISTRY. THE REGISTRY IS VITAL WHO IS VITALLY IMPORTANT AS OVER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND AND INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. ARE WAITING FOR LIFESAVING TRANSPLANTS AND TWENTY ONE INDIVIDUALS DIE EACH DAY. WITHOUT A TRANSPLANT. FOR THIS REASON IT IS CRUCIAL TO EXPAND THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CALIFORNIANS TO BE ABLE TO FINANCIALLY SUPPORT DONATE LIFE CALIFORNIA. AND GROWING THE REGISTRY OF ORGAN. AYE AND TISSUE DONORS AND THE GIFT OF LIFE. A VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION FUND WILL ALLOW CALIFORNIA'S TO MAKE THIS CHOICE EACH YEAR. NOT JUST EVERY FIVE.

SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX CALIFORNIANS HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIGN UP FOR THE ORGAN NINE TISSUE DONOR REGISTRY ON DIEM THE DRIVER'S LICENSE. AND ID APPLICATION RENEWAL FORM ALONG WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO DONATE TWO DOLLARS TO OUR ORGANIZATION. THE DOLLARS COLLECTED AS A RESULT OF THESE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE A PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDING AND COVER OPERATING COSTS OF MANAGING THE REGISTRY COMMUNITY OUTREACH. BECAUSE CALIFORNIA DMV RUNS ON A FIVE YEAR LICENSE RENEWAL CYCLE. OUR FUNDING IS INCONSISTENT WITH SOME YEARS BEING HIGHER OR LOWER THAN OTHERS DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF DRIVERS LICENSE RENEWALS. AB TWENTY NINETY SIX WERE ALLOWED TO NAY LIFE CALIFORNIA TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ANOTHER FUNDING OPPORTUNITY. FURTHER SUPPORT THE MONARCHY MODERNIZATION OF THE REGISTRY AND OUR EDUCATION AND OUTREACH ACTIVITIES AS WE. SEEK TO ENCOURAGE MORE CALIFORNIANS TO% DONATE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THINKING.
