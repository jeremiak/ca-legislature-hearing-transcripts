PRESENTING BILLS AND DIFFERENT COMMITTEES MYSELF WILL HAVE TO JUMP FROM HERE TO- GEO COMMITTEE- BUT WE'RE GOING TO GET IT STARTED AND THEN- MY COLLEAGUE- ASSEMBLY. WOMAN WENDY CARILLO WILL TAKE OVER THE MEDIUM TO FULFILL THAT THE PANEL PANEL WANTED THEN HOPEFULLY WE'RE BACK BY PANEL TO. TO BUSY DAY IN THE LEGISLATURE BUT- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE HAVING HEARINGS ON. MISSING AND MURDERED AND INDIGENOUS- PERSONS INDIGENOUS WOMEN FROM THE NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND MAKING SURE THAT ADVOCACY CONTINUES TO. MOVE FORWARD THIS MORNING WE HAD A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT WAS COMMEMORATING NATIONAL MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS PEOPLE'S DAY. AND TOMORROW ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A RESOLUTION. THAT WILL DO THE SAME THING AND MOVED TO DOESN'T IT MAY AS THE MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS PERSONS MONTH- IN TWENTY TWENTY THE NATIONAL INFORMATION PRIME CENTER REPORTED ALMOST. FIVE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED CASES OF MISSING INDIGENOUS WOMEN. BUT THE NUMBERS ARE PROBABLY MUCH HIGHER BECAUSE NOT ALL CRIMES ARE REPORTED. BECAUSE VICTIMS ARE MISCLASSIFIED UNDER OTHER ETHNICITIES- PARTICULARLY IN IN URBAN AREAS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ON SOME RESERVATIONS HOMICIDE RATES ARE MORE THAN TEN TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE- A NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE FUNDED- STUDY. FOUND THAT MORE THAN FOUR. OUT OF FIVE AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE WOMEN HAVE EXPERIENCED VIOLENCE IN THEIR LIFETIME. THESE NUMBERS INCLUDE THE ALMOST 49% WHO HAVE EXPERIENCE STOCKING. AS YOU WILL LEARN- TODAY THROUGH THE TESTIMONY THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THE DIFFERENT PANELS THAT ARE THERE. THAT WE'RE GOING TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM THOSE THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINES IN IN- INDIAN COUNTRY AS FAR AS HOW WE COULD MOVE FORWARD TO BETTER THE RELATIONSHIP AND TO ENSURE. THAT THE VOICES OF THOSE- THAT. GO THROUGH THESE TYPES OF AREAS OUR LOVED ONES THAT WE KNOW THAT WE'RE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THESE THINGS AS A STATE LEGISLATURE.

LAST AUGUST BOTH COMMITTEES HEARD FROM MYSELF AND OTHERS ABOUT THE NATIONAL MISSING MURDERED INDIGENOUS PEOPLES CRISIS AND CALIFORNIA'S RESPONSE WITH THE ENACTMENT OF ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY NINETY NINE. SO WHAT I'LL BE SHARING TODAY IS FIRST I'LL BE PROVIDING A SNAPSHOT- A CALIFORNIA'S NATIVE AMERICAN POPULATION AND THEN A BRIEF SUMMARY OF AB THIRTY NINETY NINES MANDATE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND OUR CURRENT EFFORTS IN IMPLEMENTING THE LAW THE POPULATION. AND NUMBERS FOR CALIFORNIA AND ITS NATIVE AMERICAN CITIZENS AT CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO ONE OF THE LARGEST POPULATIONS OF AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVE PEOPLE. ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY TWENTY U. S. CENSUS BUREAU. THERE ARE AN ESTIMATED ONE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED AND NINE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND NINE AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVES IN CALIFORNIA. WHO SELF IDENTIFIES SUCH ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY THREE POINT 6% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION. THE TOP FIVE COUNTIES WITH THE MOST AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVES PERSONS ARE LOS ANGELES SAN DIEGO RIVERSIDE SAN BERNARDINO AND ORANGE COUNTIES. THE TOP FIVE COUNTIES WITH THE GREATEST PROPORTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVE PERSONS ARE ALPINE WITH 22% THAT MEANS ONE IN FIVE PEOPLE IDENTIFIED AS AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVE. INYO COUNTY AT 17% DELL NORT AT COUNTY AT 10% THE GENDER DISPUTE DISTRIBUTION OF AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVE POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA ACCORDING THE TWENTY NINETEEN CENSUS. IS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL WITH BOTH MEN AND WOMEN ACCOUNTING FOR AROUND 50% OF THE POPULATION. AND IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE HOME TO APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE CALIFORNIA NAY NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES CONSISTING OF ONE HUNDRED AND NINE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES AND APPROXIMATELY SIXTY TWO NON FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES AND A LITTLE OVER ONE HUNDRED INDIAN RESERVATIONS AND RANCHERIAS THAT NEIGHBOR THIRTY FOUR OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY JURISDICTIONS THIRTY NINETY NINE KEEPING IN MIND THOSE POPULATIONS. I AM SIGNED INTO LAW SEPTEMBER TWENTY FIFTH TWENTY TWENTY ON CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN DAY- THE LOT ADDRESS TOO LONG OVERDUE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY CALIFORNIA'S NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. THE FIRST WAS THE NEED TO HAVE STATEWIDE CONSISTENCY IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PUBLIC LIFE EIGHTY THREE TO EIGHTY ALSO KNOWN AS P. L. TWO EIGHTY AT THE TRANSFER CRIMINAL JURISDICTION. ON INDIAN LANDS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO THE STATE. THE SECOND WAS TO ADDRESS THE GROWING CRISIS A MISSING AND MURDERED NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S PARTICULAR LEE WOMEN AND GIRLS AND CALIFORNIA'S INDIAN COUNTRY. AND BROADER NATIVE AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. AS DISCUSSED LAST SUMMER TO ADDRESS ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS AB THIRTY NINETY NINE CREATED THE TRIBAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S OFFICE OF NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS AND MANDATED THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WITH THREE SPECIFIC TASKS. CASK WINE IS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE REGARDING POLICING AND CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS ON INDIAN LANDS CONSISTENT WITH PUBLIC LOCK TWO EIGHTY. TAX TO WAS TO CONDUCT A STUDY TO DETERMINE HOW TO INCREASE STATE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROTECTIVE AND INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES FOR REPORTING AND IDENTIFYING MISSING NATIVE AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIA. AND HAS THREE IS TO SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY DESCRIBED IN PAST TWO. BY THE END OF FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. THIS REPORT WILL INCLUDE RECOMMENDATIONS AND PROPOSED LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE THE REPORTING AND IDENTIFICATION OF MISSING NATIVE AMERICANS. AN EXAMINATION OF DATA REGARDING CURRENT MISSING AND MURDERED NATIVE AMERICAN PERSONS IN CALIFORNIA AND THE IDENTIFICATIN OF POTENTIAL BARRIERS TO PROVIDE STATE RESOURCES NEEDED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. AS SHARED BY GENERAL BONTA WE ARE CURRENTLY IN YEAR ONE OF FIVE OF OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF AB THIRTY NINETY NINE. AS FAR AS WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE DID RECEIVE THE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AND WE HAVE HIT THE GROUND RUNNING- WE ARE CURRENTLY BUILDING A MULTI DISCIPLINED TEAM. TO ACHIEVE OPTIMUM SUCCESS IN IMPLEMENTING AB THIRTY NINETY NINE. INCLUDING CONTRACTING WITH NOTED NATIVE AMERICAN RESEARCHER AND ASSISTANT PROFESSOR AT UC MERCED DOCTOR BLACK GEORGE. TO LEAD OUR RESEARCH TEAM AND CAST TWO AND THREE WE'RE VERY EXCITED CALIFORNIA TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TRIBAL COURTS AND TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND NATIVE LEAD VICTIM ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS REGARDING AB THIRTY NINETY NINE.

WE CONTINUE TO COLLABORATE AND COORDINATE WITH OUR LOCAL STATE TRIBAL FEDERAL JUSTICE PARTNERS CONDUCTED TRAININGS ON THE ENFORCEMENT OF TRIBAL COURT PROTECTION ORDERS AND HAVE ISSUED INITIAL GUIDANCE TO LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES REGARDING PEEL TO EIGHTY FOR THE IMPROVE SAFETY ON INDIAN LANDS. WE ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING IN COLLABORATION WITH TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND NATIVE AMERICAN MISSING PERSONS FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION OUR FAQ. THAT WILL SHOW THE HOUSE WHAT'S WHEN'S AND WISE ON WHAT TO DO IF A LOVED ONE OR A TRIBAL MEMBER GOES MISSING. WE KEEP APPRISED OF NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN COMBATING THE IMPACTS BROUGHT UPON BY THE CRISIS OF MISSING MURDERED NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND CONTINUOUSLY UPDATE THE OFFICE OF NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS WEBSITE. TO PROVIDE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WITH VITAL INFORMATION. IN CLOSING AND I SHARE BY GENERAL BONTA EARLIER TODAY. WE ARE IN THE EARLY PHASES OF IMPLEMENTING AB THIRTY NINETY NINE. AND WE ARE BUILDING A MULTI DISCIPLINED TEAM TO ENSURE MEANINGFUL RESULTS FOR THE TRIBAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. WE ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGING WITH TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS LOCAL STATE TRIBAL JUSTICE PARTNERS AND NATIVE LED ORGANIZATIONS AND ASSESSING AND ADDRESSING THE ISSUES RAISED IN AB THIRTY NINETY NINE. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REMAINS COMMITTED TO THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF TRIBAL PEOPLE AND THEIR COMMUNITIES WE ARE COMMITTED TO DOING OUR PART TO STAND UP FOR ALL OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR STATE. THANK YOU. KNOW SOME OF IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH- THE DIRECTOR LOPEZ KEY FOR WE WILL NOW GO ON TO OUR DOCTOR PLACE GEORGE. PLEASE PROCEED. I AGREE NEXT NOW DOCTOR BY STORAGE MCKINLEY ROCK HELLO MY NAME IS DR BY GEORGE I'M ORIGINALLY FROM MECHNICAL CALIFORNIA LOCATED IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY ALONG THE LOST COAST OF FAR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. I'M CURRENTLY AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF SOCIOLOGY AT UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MERCED TO MY KNOWLEDGE I'M THE FIRST YOU'RE A PROFESSOR TO TEACH IN THE UC SYSTEM. I'M A MEMBER OF THE IRAQI TRIBE AND THE RESEARCH PARTNER FOR THE TACKY SCHOOL ISAAH NAY WATCH CHECK I WILL SEE YOU AGAIN IN A GOOD WAY PROJECT A PROJECT WHICH DOCUMENTS THE SCOPE AND SEVERITY OF MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN. GIRLS AND TWO SPIRIT PEOPLES IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA KNOWN AS MMIWG TWO WITH AN EMPHASIS ON INTERVENING IN THE CYCLES OF VIOLENCE BY DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING BEST PRACTICES AND PROTOCOLS FOR TRIBES LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JUSTICE SYSTEM AGENCIES IN ADDRESSING MMIWG TO CRISIS. THIS PROJECT IS FUNDED BY THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE'S COORDINATED TRIBAL ASSISTANCE SOLICITATION ALSO KNOWN AS A C. TASK GRAHAM AND THE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS TRAVEL JUST TO SUPPORT. I'VE BEEN ASKED HERE TODAY TO SPEAK ON THIS PROJECT FROM THE LEVEL OF THE DATA THE RESEARCH ON THE GROUND AND WHAT WE KNOW THAT'S FAR. NO MATTER WHAT I SAY HERE I WANT TO PREFACE IT WITH GRATITUDE TO THE SURVIVORS VICTIMS AND FAMILIES WHO LIVE THIS DAY EVERY DAY IT IS ONLY BECAUSE OF THEIR VULNERABILITY AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO LET US LEARN FROM THEIR DEEP PAIN LOSS AND GRIEF. THAT I CAN SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE IN ANY SUBSTANTIVE WAY AND THEY MAKE THESE LESSONS KNOWN TO US SO THAT WE MAY IN SOME WAY HELP THEM SEEK CLOSURE FIND JUSTICE AND ULTIMATELY HEAL FROM THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH MMIWG TWO AT HIGHLANDS AGAINST INDIGENOUS WOMEN MORE BROADLY. IMPACTS OUR COMMUNITIES EVERY AS INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. I HAVE A PHD IN SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL POLICY FROM HARVARD UNIVERSITY BY MANY ACCOUNTS I WENT TO THE BEST SOCIOLOGY PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY AT THE BEST SCHOOL IN THE WORLD. I SET UP THESE CREDENTIALS SO THAT WHEN HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEAK IN ROOM SAFE IS THIS HE WOULD LISTEN. NOT BECAUSE THE WORDSI WOULD SAY WOULD CHANGE OR THE PEOPLE I SPOKE FOR WOULD BE DIFFERENT BUT RATHER BECAUSE WITH SUCH A- YOU WOULD KNOW THAT I SPEAK FROM A PLACE OF GREAT EXPERTISE. GET AS MUCH AS I HAVE THIS EMPIRICAL SKILL SET FIRST AND FOREMOST I AM A EUROPE WOMEN. IN EARNER OR FROM THE COAST AND INDIGENOUS WOMEN WHOSE FAMILY HAS ALWAYS LIVED. IN WHAT IS NOW SET LEARNING HUMBOLDT COUNTY. MY BLOODLINE HAS LIVED IN THE VILLAGES OF REC WALK. WELL KERR AND PICK ONE SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL. I STAND BEFORE YOU BECAUSE I'M IN A POSITION TO SPEAK ON THIS CRISIS FROM BOTH THE PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL LEVEL. I SEE WITH THE EYES OF A SOCIAL SCIENTIST A SOCIOLOGIST WHO SPECIALIZES IN PRISONER REENTRY INEQUALITY AND MMI P. VERSED IN A VARIETY OF EMPIRICAL METHODS. BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST I IDENTIFY AS A STORYTELLER. A STORYTELLER WHO IN NO WAY MAKES ANY CLAIMS TO OBJECTIVITY NOR WANTS TO. HOW COULD I BE OBJECTIVE WHEN I A YUROK WOMAN FROM THE LOST COAST. HAVE BEEN TASKED WITH COUNTING TRACKING AND EXPLAINING THE SCOPE AND SEVERITY OF OUR MISSING AND MURDERED RELATIVES IN THE STATE. TRUTH BE TOLD WHEN I LOOK AT THE DATA I SEE MYSELF. I DON'T SEE MYSELF BECAUSE THEY SHARE SO MUCH IN COMMON WITH MANY OF THE ENTRIES. I SEE MYSELF IN THE DATA BECAUSE IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE. I KNEW THREE OF THE WOMEN WHO WERE TAKEN FROM US. FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR PRIVACY AND THAT OF THEIR FAMILIES. I SPEAK ONLY GENERALLY ON THEIR CASES. FOR THE FIRST WOMAN IT WAS HALFWAY THROUGH THE PANDEMIC WHEN I READ HER NAME. AS BRIGHT OF A WOMAN WHO ONCE PLAYED WITH ME UNDER THE BLEACHERS AT THE INTER TRIBAL ELDERS GATHERING. AND THEN WE CHIU TOGETHER FOR YOUTH FOOTBALL. SHE WAS FOUND FAR FROM HOME. LIFTED INSIDE A SUITCASE AND FOUND BY A STRANGER. THE NEXT WOMAN THROWN CARELESSLY TO THE SIDE BY GOD KNOWS WHO MEMBER. WHO AFTER ENJOYING HER COMPANY HEARING HER LAUGH SEEING HER EYES THAT WERE SO PRETTY. THEY MADE HONEY JEALOUS. THEY LEFT HER FOR DEAD AT THE BOTTOM OF A HILL TOP. SHE TOO WOULD BE FOUND BY A STRANGER WHO HAD MORE COMPASSION THAN THE PERSON. WHO LEFT HER THERE. THEN LAST OCTOBER MY FRIEND WAS TAKEN FROM US. NO ONE KNOWS HOW OR WHY. ALL WE KNOW IS IT SHE VANISHED IN THE MOST REMOTE CORNER OF OUR RESERVATION. AND A PLACE I WOULD ARGUE IS ONE OF THE MOST REMOTE REGIONS IN THE LOWER FORTY EIGHT STATES. NOW IT IS SOMEONE I LOVE SOMEONE I HAD TO SPACES ON THE MISSING PERSONS FLYER. AND NOW I'VE BEEN CALLED HERE TODAY TO SPEAK TO YOU FROM THE LEVEL OF THE DATA. BUT AS I SAID I'M A STORYTELLER AND I HAVE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT BEFORE I CAN SPEAK ON ANY OF THESE TRENDS. I HAVE TO BRING THESE STORIES TO BEAR. I ONCE THOUGHT I HAD READ EVERY BOOK EVERY STUDY KNEW EVERYTHING THERE WAS TO KNOW ABOUT THIS ISSUE. BUT THERE WERE LESSONS I HAD NOT YET LEARNED AND WITH THESE THREE CASES. TEACHINGS I NEVER WANTED BUT NOW WALK WITH NONETHELESS HAVE COME TO ME. AS AN INDIGENOUS WOMAN I KNOW THAT I AM MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE VIOLENCE AND SERIOUS HARM THE NOT. A RISK THAT FOLLOWS ME ACROSS THE LIFE COURSE. THE ONLY OTHERS TO SHARE THIS BURDEN ON MY FELLOW INDIGENOUS RELATIVES OF ALL GENDERS. WE ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE VIOLENCE AND DEATH ACROSS THE LIFE COURSE. WHEN COMPARED TO ALMOST EVERY GROUP. YET EVEN STILL WHEN SPEAKING ON THIS EPIDEMIC WE MUST FRIENDS STAGE THE UNIQUE EXPERIENCE OF WOMEN. GIRLS INTO SPIRITS BECAUSE IT IS THESE GROUPS. THAT HAVE HAD THE DISTINCTION OF EXISTING SQUARELY WITHIN. THE CROSSHAIRS OF THE SETTLER COLONIAL PROJECT. THEY WERE TARGETED. SHE'S ME THEIR CAPACITY AS LIFE GIVERS. AND SPIRITUAL KNOWLEDGE KEEPERS. FOR THE VERY REASONS FOR WHICH THEY WERE TARGETED FROM THE FIRST DAYS OF THE INVASION. AND THEY ARE THE REASONS WHY NOW IN PRESENT DAY WHEN THEY ARE HARMED. THEY'RE JUST GO UNNOTICED UNSOLVED OR WORSE. MUCH WORK REMAINS ON HIS TOPIC THAT BASED ON OUR WORK WITH I WILL SEE YOU AGAIN IN A GOOD WAY WE KNOW SEVERAL THINGS TO BE TRUE. WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA'S IN THE TOP FIVE FOR MMI W. P. CASES. WITH EIGHTEEN CASES IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE IN THE STATE. OVER HALF OF THESE CASES WERE LOCATED NORTH OF THE BEAR. AREAS THOSE CASES OF. FOR WITHIN THE- OF THE HUMBOLDT COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. THIS MEANS THAT JUST ONE RURAL POLICE DEPARTMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF MMI W. P. CASES IN THE STATE. YET LIKE OTHER RURAL POLICE FORCES. THERE GENERALLY UNDERFUNDED STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN STAFFING. AND I'M GOING TO DATE AND THE ONGOING DAILY LAW ENFORCEMENT CALLS. LEAVE LITTLE ROOM FOR THE VITAL WORK OF COLD CASE CLOSURE. NO MATTER HOW IMPORTANT THESE CASES ARE TO THE SHERIFF AND MANY OTHERS AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND JUSTICE SYSTEMS THE VERY REAL CONSTRAINTS PLACED ON THEM BY RURAL POLICING. LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO THE CRISIS. NO MATTER THEIR COMMITMENT OR EFFORTS TO SOLVE CASES. RURAL POLICE AND THEIR TRAVEL COUNTERPARTS. LACKS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AND THIS IS HANDS DOWN THE BIGGEST RECOMMENDATION. THANKFULLY PARTNER WITH THE TRIBAL NATIONS. THAT SHARE THEIR JURISDICTION. BY OFFERING THE MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES TO DO SO. CHIEFLY PUBLIC LAW TO EIGHTY SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AS IT LEFT TRIBES WITHOUT THE RESOURCES. TO FULLY STAFF TRAVEL ON FORSMAN. AND WE MUST BETTER SUPPORT THESE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. AS THEY ARE CLOSEST TO THIS CRISIS THESE NUMBERS ON MISSING AND MURDERED ARE CONTEXTUALIZED WITHIN GRIEVOUS VIOLENCE AGAINST INDIGENOUS WOMEN AND INDIGENOUS BODIES WERE GENERALLY. INDIGENOUS WOMEN ARE AT A HIGHER RISK OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE TRAFFICKING. AND MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE SERIOUS VIOLENCE KIDNAPPING AND HOMICIDE THAN THEIR NON INDIGENOUS COUNTERPARTS. HOMICIDE IS THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA NATIVE WOMEN WITH THE VIOLENCE EXPERIENCED BY INDIGENOUS WOMEN BEING ESPECIALLY SEVERE AND FREQUENTLY A PRECURSOR TO THEIR DISAPPEARANCE OR DEATH. GOING FURTHER NATIVE WOMEN ARE MURDERED MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE INTERRACIAL VIOLENCE WHICH IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT THAN INTRA RACIAL VIOLENCE. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT WHEN INDIVIDUALS ARE VICTIMIZED IS TYPICALLY BY SOMEONE OF THEIR SAME RACE. THIS IS NOT THE CASE FOR INDIGENOUS WOMEN ARE PERPETRATORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE NON NATIVE. AND AGAIN THAT'S LINKING BACK TO THE SETTLER COLONIAL LEGACY WHERE OUR BODIES ARE THE LANDSCAPE BY WHICH COLONIAL VIOLENCE HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE WAGED. OUR FOUNDING MYTHS ARE BUTTRESSED BY DISGUSTING TRUTH IF YOU HARMON INDIGENOUS WOMEN YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET AWAY WITH IT. WE ENSCONCED THIS IN LINE EVEN RESERVATIONS IS CASE IN POINT ARE AREAS RIFE WITH JURISDICTIONAL LOOPHOLES LEGAL COMPLEXITIES AND ULTIMATELY CRIMINAL SILENCE. ROVING SERIAL KILLERS OF WHICH THE FBI ESTIMATES ARE OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED CIRCULATING IN OUR NATION AT THIS VERY MOMENT. AND ALL THOSE OTHERS WHO WOULD DO HARM TO WOMEN SEEK OUT THESE PLACES AND THE BODIES OF WOMEN LIKE ME WHO LIVE THERE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEY WILL NOT GET CAUGHT. AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS IT'S HARD TO DISPUTE THIS INTERPRETATION MURDERS OF NATIVE WOMEN IN THE STATE ARE SEVEN TIMES LESS LIKELY TO BE SOLVED IN SIMILAR CASES WITH NON NATIVE VICTIMS. EVEN WITH SUCH TRENDS WE KNOW THE STATE IS ONLY A FIRST GLANCE. AND AS A PROJECT WE ARE LEFT SIFTING THROUGH WHAT DATA DO EXIST TO BETTER SPEAK TO THIS CRISIS. EVEN AS SO MANY FAMILIES AND SURVIVORS KNOW IT WELL BEYOND THE CAPACITY FOR ANY METRIC TO FULLY CAPTURE. DRAWN FROM THE DATA AND THE LESSON SHARED WITH THIS BIG HE STAKEHOLDERS WE OVERWHELMINGLY UNDERSCORE THE NEED TO DO THE HARD WORK OF ESTABLISHING THE PRACTICES AND PROTOCOLS. THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THIS MATTER IN PARTICULAR BUT ALSO RELEVANT TO CALL CASES AT LARGE. ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS SPECIAL JOURNAL ISSUES ON M. M. I. W. P. WE ARE IN A CRISIS OF COLD CASES IN THIS COUNTRY AND THIS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTS. INDIGENOUS WOMEN AS WE MAKE UP A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF THESE OPEN CASES. ULTIMATELY WE NEED TO INVEST THE RESOURCES INTO ESTABLISHING A VARIETY OF MECHANISMS. FROM BEFORE SOMEONE IS TAKEN AFTER THEY'RE MISSING OR MURDERED. OR AND THROUGH CASE CLOSURE. IN OUR YEAR TO REPORT DUE FOR RELEASE IN JULY WE WILL TAKE A FIRST STEP IN DESIGNING SUCH PROTOCOLS. AS PART OF A TRIBAL COMMUNITY RESPONSE PLAN OR T. C. R. P. AS RECOMMENDED BY THE EDERAL GOVERNMENT. FOR DRESSING THE MMI W. P. CRISIS WILL MAKE THESE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO THE STATE AND ALL OTHER TRIBES. AS A BE READY FOR USE IN REAL TIME BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JUSTICE SYSTEM AGENCIES. SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ALL OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. SOMEONE RECENTLY ASKED ME WHAT DOES IT MATTER THAT THE YUROK TRIBE IS MOVING ON THIS ISSUE. WHAT CAN ONE LITTLE TRIBE DUE. TO WHICH I REPLIED THERE IS NO LITTLE TRIBE IN A STATE LIKE OURS. CALIFORNIA IS BY SOME ACCOUNTS THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD NOT JUST THE NATION. WHEN WE TAKE THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY AND WE MAKE INTERVENTIONS THAT ARE NEEDED. THIS WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WHOLE OF INDIAN COUNTRY AND PERHAPS GLOBAL INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES AT LARGE. IT IS VITAL THAT WE TAKE ACTION AND THAT EACH OF YOU STAND ON THE SIDE OF BEING ABLE TO DO THAT. BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL LISTEN WHEN CALIFORNIA MOVES ON THIS ISSUE. AND THAT COULD BE A TEMPLATE FOR SO MUCH. REMEMBER THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN THIS EITHER TRIBES ARE HERE TO COLLABORATE. IF YOU IN YOUR RESPECTIVE DISTRICTS HAVING ALREADY REACHED OUT TO THE LOCAL TRIBES. DON'T WAIT FOR THEM TO CALL YOU. CALL THEM TODAY AND MAKE TIME TO SIT WITH THEIR COUNCIL. THERE'S SO MUCH THAT WE IS TRIBES COULD BRING TO THE TABLE. THERE ARE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. ARE UNIQUELY SUITED TO DO IS THOSE WHO KEEP US SAFE. BUT THERE'S ALSO TASK TO WHICH WE IS TRIBES ARE UNIQUELY SUITED TO DO. THAT COULD HELP THEM IN THESE EFFORTS. AND THESE TEACHINGS ARE JUST FOR US. THERE'S POWERFUL MEDICINE HERE THAT COULD BE SHARED WITH SO MANY COMMUNITIES IN SIMILAR CONDITIONS. WE NEED TO ACT NOW. IN CLOSING I MUST REMIND YOU THAT NO DATA ANYWHERE CAN FULLY CAPTURE WHAT IS LOST WHEN OUR RELATIVES ARE TAKEN. OUR NUMBERS NO MATTER HOW DIRE. CAN ONLY FALL SHORT OF SHOWING HOW MUCH IS LOST WITH EACH INDIGENOUS LIFE. FAR TOO OFTEN AS SOCIAL SCIENTISTS WE TALK ABOUT DATA ESPECIALLY HARD NUMBERS. AS SOME KIND OF GOLD STANDARD. I KNOW FIRST HAND HOW THIS CAN NEVER BE THE CASE NOR THE AND ALL. WHEN IT COMES TO THIS EPIDEMIC. EVEN AS WE FASHION STUDY INSTRUMENTS TO CAPTURE THIS CRISIS. EVEN THE BEST TOOL FAILED TO CAPTURE THE RIPPLING ABSENCE. THAT CASCADES THROUGH THE LIVES OF THOSE LEFT BEHIND. CHILDREN LOSING MOTHERS FAMILIES LOSING SISTERS COUSINS SIBLINGS. AUNTIES LITTLE SISTERS AND BABY COUSINS. LEAVING AND NEVER COMING HOME AGAIN. THEIR VOICES NO LONGER SING OUR SONGS. THEIR HANDS NO LONGER RADAR HERE. THEY'RE NOT THERE TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR PARENTS. OR THEIR CHILDREN. WHO SIT INSTEAD IN THE ABSENCE OF THEIR LOVED ONE. WALKOUT FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. YOUR ATTENTION AND YOUR ACTION. THANK YOU. A DOCTOR GEORGE AND I THINK OF. MY CALLING FROM THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY AND I JUST. WOULD LIKE TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE AND SHARE IN YOUR GRIEF. AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING AND I'M SO SORRY. AT FOR THE THREE WOMEN THAT YOU KNEW PERSONALLY. AND TO EVERYONE HERE- IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS TRULY MEANS- FOR WOMEN AND FOR GIRLS. YES PLEASE GO AHEAD YES THANK YOU FOR THAT- I. I KNOW THAT YOUR PAIN IS AND IN NO COMPARISON BUT I- I WAS BORN IN WHAT IS MEXICO AND YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S A STORY ABOUT THE WHAT THE MISSING WOMEN AND WHAT IS ON FORTUNATELY FROM ME- MY PARENTS BROUGHT US TO THE TO CALIFORNIA WHEN WE WERE YOUNG SO WE DON'T GET TO EXPERIENCE THAT BUT I KNOW. THAT WE HAVE SIMILAR STORIES AND QUITE AS MEXICO THAT YOU DO HERE'S ALL AGAIN MY CONDOLENCES ON. THAT AND- WE HEAR ABOUT IT BUT- WE HEAR ABOUT IT. SOMEWHERE SOMETIME IT HAPPENS SOMEWHERE AND YOU KNOW IT TO BRING IT HERE AND- MAKE THOSE VOICES ARE THOSE FACES REAL AND KIND OF THE STATISTICS REAL- YOU KNOW IS REALLY IMPORTANT SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE CHANCE TO DO SO THANK YOU I WAS EXACTLY THINKING ABOUT THE WOMEN IN WHAT IS IN YOUR EXPERIENCE AS WELL. AND AGAIN THANK YOU AND- OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES ON BEHALF OF. THIS SELECT COMMITTEE THE NATIVE AMERICAN CAUCUS AND OUR STATE LEGISLATURE AND THIS IS WHY. THESE CONVERSATIONS ARE SO CRITICAL AND WHY THIS HEARING IS SO INVALUABLE. WE'RE GONNA MOVE FORWARD- WITH HUMBLE COUNTY SHERIFF WILL. THANK YOU SEPTEMBER CARILLO SO MEMBER RUBIO. SEE THE OPTION TO SPEAK WITH YOU ALL HERE AND BE A PARTNER HERE ON THIS PANEL- DOCTOR BLIGHT- MY LOVE IS KEEPER WE WORK TOGETHER ALL OF US ON THIS ISSUE AND HAD OPEN LINES OF COMMUNICATION OVER LAST COUPLE YEARS ABOUT THIS AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I'M- HAPPY IS ON THE FOREFRONT. AND WE SEE NOW BOTH STATEWIDE AND NATIONALLY THAT PEOPLE ARE TAKING NOTE BUT IT'S JUST ONE THING TAKING NOTE. IT'S ON THE THING TO TAKE ACTION. AND SO RIGHT NOW IS OUR ACTION PHASE. AND NOW WERE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. AND NOW WE CALLED ATTENTION TO THIS. AND NOW WE'VE COMMUNICATED IT NOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON THIS ISSUE AND SO I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT WE ARE. THERE STEPS THAT WE'RE TAKING- ON THE STATE SHERIFFS LEVEL AS WELL AS LOCALLY- TO ADDRESS THIS AND I APOLOGIZE IT INTRODUCE MYSELF MY NAME IS BILLY HANS ON THE SHERIFF OF HUMBOLDT COUNTY- AND ALSO THE- CHAIR. OF TRIBAL AFFAIRS FOR THE STATE CHURCH ORGANIZATION. AND AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT AS FAR AS A STATE SHERIFFS GO WE ARE ALL POISED TO MOVE TOGETHER MOVE FORWARD. WITH WORKING TOGETHER AND- AND SO WE SEE THIS AS A STATEWIDE PROBLEM. HOW WONDER THINGS ARE WORKING ON A COUPLE COUNTY IS OUR ABILITY TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE TRIBES WORK TOGETHER WITH TRIBAL POLICE. WE HAVE THREE- DEPUTIES ATION AGREEMENTS WITH TRIBAL POLICE OFFICERS. POLICE DEPARTMENT EXCUSE ME THE YUROK TRIBE HOOPA TRIBE AND BLUE LAKE RANCHERIA IT IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS ON THE FOREFRONT OF. MAKING SURE THAT THAT THE COMMUNITY NO ONE HAS THE ABILITY TO POLICE THEIR OWN TO GET OUT IN IN INTO THE RURAL AREAS OF OUR COUNTY AND TO HAVE. THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE STATE LAW AS YOU KNOW PULIC LOT TO EIGHTY PUTS THE RESPONSIBILITY ON ENFORCING THE STATE LAW ON THE SHERIFF'S OF EACH COUNTY. AND IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO SO BUT WHAT WE CAN DO WHAT WE DOING HERE IN HUMBLE COUNTY IS MAKING RESERVE DEPUTY SHERIFFS OF TRIBAL OFFICERS. WE'RE HOPING WORKING WITH TRIBAL POLICE WORKING WITH THE TRIBAL POLICE SHE'S ASSOCIATION WITH THE OTHER TRIBES TO TRY AND CHANGE THE LAW. I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL I THINK THE TIME IS NOW. TO CHANGE THE LAW TO ALLOW TRAVEL OFFICERS TO BECOME POST CERTIFIED IN A FOR STATE LAW ON TRIBAL LAND. I'VE SAID IT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR- I'VE TALKED TO SEVERAL PEOPLE ABOUT IT AND WE ARE THERE TO SUPPORT THAT AND SUPPORT THAT IF IT DOES COME TO A- THE ASSEMBLY FOR AND THE LAWS CHANGED- IN THE MEANTIME. COMMUNICATION COLLABORATION- WE'VE HAD A RECENT CASE THAT DOCTOR GEORGE REFERRED TO AS A MISSING PERSON BACK IN IN THE FALL AND IT'S A VERY. HEART WRENCHING STORY. AND- AND SO. WE WANT TO DO OUR BEST. IN THESE SITUATIONS AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE YUROK TRIBE HOOPA TRIBE IN HUMBLE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE COMING TOGETHER. AND WORKING TOGETHER TO TRY AND SOLVE A MISSING PERSONS CASE- UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE RESOLUTION OF THAT CASE BUT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE ARE. DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO TRY AND FIND HER RIGHT NOW- AND THAT'S INCLUDING BRING IN OUTSIDE RESOURCES- TALKING THE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS. THE FBI- EVERY KIND OF RESOURCE WE POSSIBLY CAN BRING IN TO SOLVE THIS. AND THAT'S WHAT IT'S GONNA TAKE BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING TO DO SOMETHING BUT IT'S ALSO BUILDING TRUST WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES. ONE THING WE RECOGNIZE IS THAT THE GENERATIONAL DISTRUST WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT PUBLIC LAW TO EIGHTY WAS FORCED ON THE TRIBES THIS WASN'T ASKED FOR. THIS WASN'T COLLABORATED WITH IT WAS FORCED ON THE TRIBES OF THE STATE- AND SO WHAT WE CAN DO NOW IS WORK WITH THE TRIBES ARE TRYING TO BUILD TRUST. AND THAT HAPPENS ONE CASE AT A TIME IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE'RE GONNA DO THINGS CORRECTLY EVERY TIME IT'S IMPOSSIBLE BUT THERE IS MECHANISM IS NOW. THAT NGUYEN MISTAKES FROM WHEN THINGS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY ADDRESS THOSE WITH EACH OTHER HAVING REGULAR CHECK INS WITH THE TRIBAL CHAIR GERMANS WITH REGULAR CHECK INS WITH THE TRIBAL POLICE CHIEFS WITH THE COMMUNITY. AND THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHAT'S NECESSARY THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS HAVING THE SHERIFF'S OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THAT IN CHARGE OF THAT JURISDICTION TO HAVE. COMMUNITY MEETINGS TO LISTEN. TO THE PEOPLE. TO LISTEN TO WHAT'S GOING ON THE GROUND BECAUSE WHAT I HEAR. ON MY END COULD BE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE COMMUNITY UNDERSTANDS AND HEARS. AND SO THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE'RE COMMITTED TO AND THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE ARE WE ARE WANTING TO DO- SO. GO AHEAD I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT BUT THIS WHOLE ENTIRE TIME WHEN YOU'RE HAVING YOUR TELL ME THAT I I'M TRYING TO THINK BACK DID I MISS ANYTHING ON THE NEWS BECAUSE IF ANY THERE WAS ANY OTHER MISSING PERSON IT WOULD BE ALL OVER THE NEWS- I KNOW I'M FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT I KNOW WE'VE YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN SEVERAL OCCASIONS WHERE THERE'S A MISSING PERSON AND IT'S ALL OVER THE NEWS I HAVEN'T SEEN IT IS IT ME THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN IT OR IS IT THAT IT'S NOT AS PUBLICIZED. AS OTHER CASES RIGHT AND YOU KNOW I **** SAY ASKED SAME QUESTION OF OUR MEDIA LOCALLY THAT THE INFORMATION IS PUT OUT THERE WHAT THEY WHAT CERTAIN MEDIA OUTLETS TAKE UP AN ADVERTISE VERSUS OTHERS- WHAT DRIVES THE NEWS WHAT DR SOCIAL MEDIA IT IS BEYOND ME IT REALLY IS- THE FACT IS THAT YOU KNOW US LOCALLY WE HAVE TO START THERE AND WE HAVE TO PUSH INFORMATION OUT WE HAVE TO LET PEOPLE KNOW AND WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS IN THE FOREFRONT. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE STILL LOOKING- THE ONE THING THAT WAS ON THE- THE SECOND REPORTED IN THE MY W. WAS MAKING SURE THAT EACH JURISDICTION HAS THE HAS COLD CASES ADVERTISED SO WE CAN KEEP THE INFORMATION ON THE FOREFRONT SO THE COMMUNITY KNOWS THE FAMILY MEMBERS KNOW THAT WE ARE STILL LOOKING AND THAT THEIR MISSING AND MURDERED. LOVE ONE. IT IS STILL A PART OF OUR CASES AND WE'RE ASKING FOR HELP. OR ASKING FOR TECHNICAL% ASSISTANCE OR ASKING FOR WITNESSES TO COME FORWARD. BECAUSE WE'VE WE KNOW PEOPLE NOTICE THINGS. AT TIMES AND THEY JUST REFUSED TO COME FORWARD AND I THINK PART OF THAT IS BUILDING TRUST. WITHIN COMMUNITIES SO THEY NOW WE DID HAVE. A MISSING PERSONS CASE IN WHO BOUGHT. LAST YEAR- WHERE GEMMA WENT MISSING. AND HIS CAR WAS FOUND. AND AFTER THE INFORMATION WAS PUT OUT THERE. COMMITTEE MEMBER STARTED COMING FORWARD. AND THROUGH COMMUNITY MEMBERS BEEN ABLE TO TELL US WHAT THEY KNEW WE WERE ABLE TO ROUTE IT BACK TO WHERE THE VICTIM WAS LOCATED. DECEASED AS WELL AS ARREST THE PEOPLE THAT MURDERED HIM. AND SO THAT'S ONE CASE. BUT THAT'S ONE THING CASE THAT BUILDS TRUST WITHIN THE COMMUNITY WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO CARRY THAT FORWARD AND TRY TO DO MORE. BUT AGAIN IT'S GONNA TAKE ONE CASE AT A TIME. AND AND SO I'M HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS I'M HERE TO COLLABORATE AND- AND DO WHATEVER WE CAN BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE DR GEORGE- AND THE REPORT THAT THEY THAT THEY PUSH OUT EVERY- EVERY COUPLE MONTHS. IT IS IMPORTANT WE DO KEEP THIS IN THE FOREFRONT. FOLLOW UP QUESTION TO- ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOUR POINT IS RIGHT ON CUE IN TERMS OF HOW THE MEDIA PORTRAYS CERTAIN STORIES WHEN IT COMES TO INDIGENOUS WOMEN OR WOMEN OF COLOR AND GENERALLY WHEN. GONE MISSING OR A CERTAIN KIND OF CASES NOT AS ELEVATED AS IT IS A WITH OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND- WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE- MY QUESTION IS THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. AS WELL AS LAW ENFORCEMENT AS TO WHAT YOU SEE OUR POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES IN TERMS OF HOW- YOU KNOW EVERY TRIBE A RESERVATION AS ITS OWN SOVEREIGN NATION. SO THEN HOW CAN WE COLLABORATE AS A STATE IN IMPACTFUL LEGISLATION THAT SUPPORTS JUSTICE AND SAFETY. WELL NOT IMPOSING ON TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY AND WHAT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY LOOK LIKE. THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION- BECAUSE WE DON'T AND WE DO NOT WANT TO STEP ON TOES. AND WE WANT TO WORK TOGETHER AND I THINK THAT COMES FROM HIS PLACE OF RESPECT I THINK HAVING EACH TRIBE EVALUATE THEIR OWN NEEDS AND FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY- NEED BECAUSE EACH TRIBAL- ENTITY HAS. THE ABILITY TO SELF GOVERNED SELF POLICE- AND EACH EACH- EACH TRIBE. HAS IN A DIFFERENT STAGE OF THAT YOU WITH ANYONE EVEN WITHIN OUR OWN COUNTY WE HAVE DIFFERENT STAGES OF TRIBAL POLICE. AND SO WHAT THE YUROK. NEEDS BABY IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT BLUE LAKE NEEDS AND SO I THINK HAVING A CHECK IN WITH THEM AND- WITH DOJ WITH MYSELF WITH THE FBI. AND COMMUNICATE EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED IS PROBABLY THAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO. IT WOULD NEED TO BE LED BY THE TRIBES- AND AS I MENTIONED- THERE'S OVER A HUNDRED RESERVATIONS- AND THERE'S- THE RESERVATIONS ARE BORDERED BY THIRTY FOUR OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES SO THIRTY FOUR SHERIFF'S- AND THAT COORDINATION. AND RELATIONSHIP BUILDING- BECAUSE THERE ARE HISTORICAL TENSIONS- JUSTIFIED- A LOT OF DISTRESSED ISSUES- BUT- AS- EVERY TRIBE- HAS. INHERENT SOVEREIGNTY- AND THEY HAVE CONCURRENT CRIMINAL JURISDICTION SO THE TRIBES CAN- THEY CAN IMPOSE OUR OWN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEMS. WE DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHT NOW- BUT AS SURE CONSULATES ST IT'S GOING TO TAKE- A LOT OF. AS PART IN NATION- AND SHARING OF INFORMATION BECAUSE RIGHT NOW- THERE'S NOT ANY REAL SHARING OF INFORMATION BETWEEN LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE TRIBES- AND SO WE NEED TO BUILD BACK KIND OF PIPELINE- FIRST SO I'M HOPING- THAT. DR GEORGE OF SHE GETS THE START WORKING- ON OUR STUDY COME JULY. WE HAVE TO WAIT FOR YUROK IT'S IMPORTANT RIGHT THE TRIBES ARE SEEN AS A COLLABORATOR IN A RESOURCE IN THIS MATTER TRUTHFULLY THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT ONLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO. AND I THINK. YOU KNOW I'M CLOSE TO THIS ISSUE AND THERE'S PEOPLE EVEN CLOSER STILL WHO ARE ON OUR PROJECT TEAM LOOKING FOR THEIR RELATIVES AND- AND THAT IS ACTUALLY THE STATE OF THIS ISSUE I WOULD HAZARD A GUESS FOR MOST TRIBES IT WILL TRY TO. LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE AND ANY OR EXIT REPRESENT THEIR INTERESTS WE ARE OFTEN ONLY ONE OR TWO PEOPLE REMOVED. AND I THINK THAT OFTEN THEIR TRIBES ARE AT A LOSS OF WHERE TO START. AND END YEARS ONE AND TWO AND IN YEAR THREE WE ACTUALLY SHARE STUDY INSTRUMENTS OF THE TRIBES THEMSELVES CAN START COLLECTING THIS DATA GET THE SCOPE AND SEVERITY OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO THAT WHEN THEY GO TO WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JUSTICE SYSTEM THEY HAVE SOME SOMETHING TO GO ON AND AREN'T STARTING FROM SCRATCH I THINK SO. AS MUCH AS WE ASK TRIBES TO LEAD THE WAY WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THEY'RE DOING SO WITHIN A VASTLY UNDER RESOURCE CONTACTS AND SO MAKING RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR THIS ISSUE IN PARTICULAR WOULD ALLOW THEM TO START ESTABLISHING THOSE BASS LINES WHICH IN TURN CAN INFORM OUR INTERVENTIONS. ACT DATA IS MY WHOLE JAM BUT I DO THINK IT STARTS WITH BEING ABLE TO COLLECT THE DATA AND HONORING TRIBAL ACCESS TO THIS IMPORTANT DATA ON OUR MEMBERSHIP. A LOT OF ITS EDUCATION AS WELL AND PROVIDING THOSE RESOURCES. SO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE- IS COMMITTEDTO WORKING WITH THE TRIBES- PROVIDING THE TOOL KITS FOR THE DNA COLLECTION. SO THAT IF THEY HAVE HAD A MISSING LEVEL AND OUR TRAVEL MEMBER- AND- THEY HAVE A BEEN GONE FOR AWHILE- THEY'VE BEEN MISSING AND- WE CAN GO AHEAD AND HELP COLLECT THAT DNA. US SO THAT WE COULD PUT IT IN OUR CODE ASSYSTEM AND IF THEIR FAMILY MEMBER. IS DECEASED AND WE CAN BE ABLE TO BRING THEM HOME FOR THEM. SO THOSE ARE THE TYPE OF RESOURCES THAT DEPARTMENT JUSTICE IS LOOKING AT AND LIKE I MENTIONED THE FAQ I'D BE ABLE TOPROVIDE THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE JUST NOT BEING PROVIDED TO THE TRIBAL CITIZENS. ANOTHER THING THAT- IT'S HARD TO TRACK AS FAR AS- WE'RE TAKING MISSING PERSONS CASES WE TRACK NATIVE AMERICAN WE CHECKED THAT BOX WE DON'T TRACK INDIVIDUAL TRIBES MMHM AND SO WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT COLLABORATION. THE END AND WE MAKE REFERRALS ON CHILD ABUSE CASES TO DIFFERENT DIFFERENT YOU KNOW TRIBES AS WELL AS WHY CAN'T WE DO THAT WITH MISSING PERSONS CASES AND YOU KNOW I TALKED TO MERRY AND APARTMENT JESS'S LOOK AT THIS BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IT CAN'T BE AN EASY FIX. THAT IT'S IT CAN BE A TRIPLICATE FOR ME CAN BE A FORM THAT'S EASILY MODIFIED AND ANOTHER BOX PUT IN THE SYSTEM THAT SAYS THIS IS THE TRIBE AND THEN ONCE THE TRIBE IS FLAGGED IN OUR SYSTEM THAT AUTOMATICALLY GET SENT TO THAT TRIBE THE TRIBE SIR HAVE. YOU HAVE NCIC ACCESS AND WE CAN BE ABLE TO PUT THIS INFORMATION OUT SO IF THERE'S A YUROK TRIBAL MEMBER THAT GOES MISSING IN EUREKA CALIFORNIA AND EUREKA CALIFORNIA TAKE ARGUE WE GET P. TAKES A MISSING PERSONS CASES AND THE FAMILY SAYS THERE ARE YUROK TRIBAL MEMBER THEY IDENTIFY THEIR AND THEN THAT INFORMATION GO THERE SO THEN YOU OUGHT TRAVEL PLEASE CAN FOLLOW UP TRIBAL COUNCIL CAN FOLLOW UP AND THEY CAN OFFER SERVICES TO THE FAMILY. IT JUST MAKES SENSE BUT THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE CAN DO ON A STATE LEVEL TO HELP OUT WITH THAT COOPERATION AND THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL- ADVISEMENT ON THIS- IS TO- IF YOU'RE HAVING THAT REYES IDENTIFIER- ON ANY OF THE DATA THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED TO INCLUDE A TRIBAL AFFILIATION- INDICATOR AS WELL SO WHEN THE AN INDIVIDUAL MARKS THE AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVE BOX OR NATIVE AMERICAN BOX- TO ALLOW FOR A POPULAR AUTO POPULATION. OF THE DIFFERENT TRIBES SO THE. FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR- RECOGNIZE TRY IN THE NAY. YOU CAN HAVE STATE RECOGNISED TRIBES AS WELL AS- THE NON FAMILY RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION IT CAN BE AUTO POPULATED- BUT THIS WOULD ASSIST. NOT ONLY IN. HAVING THAT ENGAGEMENT WITH THE TRIBES SO THAT BACK THAT SHARING OF INFORMATION IS THERE. BUT ALSO SHARE COUNCIL MENTIONED THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT SITUATIONS WHERE. I TRIED CAN BE- HAS RESOURCES THAT THE STATE DOESN'T HAVE- ESPECIALLY IF IT'S CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE- FOR COULD BE FOR CHILD WELFARE SERVICES IT COULD BE FOR VICTIM ASSISTANCE IT COULD BE FOR OFFENDER- AS RE ENTRY. OF PROGRAMS SO- HAVING THAT ADDITIONAL IDENTIFIER WOULD BE VALUABLE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THIS QUESTIONS I KNOW THAT- SURE AND ASSEMBLYWOMAN SHARON QUIRK SILVA HAS ALSO A QUESTION OR COMMENT- GOOD AFTERNOON AND PLEASE FORGIVE ME BECAUSE WE JUST CAME FROM ANOTHER HEARING SO I DIDN'T GET TO HEAR THE FIRST INFORMATION. BUT I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT COLLABORATION AND- CROSS JURISDICTION- ON AND SO FORTH AND- ON A PERSONAL NOTE OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO BEFORE IT I WAS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER FOR MANY YEARS AND I WORKED AS A CHAIR OF A COLLABORATIVE- THIS IS IN FULLER TEN SO NOTHING RELATED TO THIS TOPIC. BUT WE BROUGHT TOGETHER. MANY AT TO TEASE TOGETHER EDUCATION PUBLIC SAFETY HEALTH CARE AND WAS VERY INTENTIONAL TO MEET MONTHLY TO REALLY DEFINE WHETHER OR GANG ISSUES WHETHER IT'S HEALTH CARE EDUCATION ISSUES. BUT I GUESS WHAT I'M WONDERING IS DO YOU HAVE A COLLABORATIVE THAT ACTUALLY DOES- THAT AND- I KNOW THAT THE JURISDICTIONS- AS FAR AS- BEING ABLE TO BE. NEAR EACH OTHER COULD BE VERY EXPENSIVE BUT WITH- YOU KNOW REMOTE IT COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE VERY INTENTIONAL ABOUT WHETHER IT'S MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY THAT YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO BRING IN- AS YOU SAID SOCIAL SERVICES EVEN HUMAN TRAFFICKING. BECAUSE I KNOW IN EDUCATION THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN CAMPAIGNS FOR WHETHER IT'S LITERACY OR BUT YOU KNOW ALSO SAFETY SO IF YOU SEE SOMETHING SAY SOMETHING SO REALLY EDUCATING NOT ONLY THE FAMILIES THAT BUT ALSO PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF- IF OU WANT TO SAY- THE TRIBES BECAUSE THEY MAY SEE SOMETHING EVEN IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. OF DOES THIS- BECAUSE WE'RE ALWAYS LOOKING IS THIS PERSON LOOK LIKE THEY'RE UNDER DURESS IS THERE SOMEBODY THAT MAY NOT WE DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE HERE AND IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE REPORTING OUT ON NEIGHBORS FOR NO REASON BUT I'M JUST SAYING THAT COLLABORATIVE VERY INTENTIONAL. AND AN EDUCATION. KIND OF CAMPAIGN. IF YOU'RE DOING THAT- ALREADY THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU ARE JUST DON'T KNOW. I THINK THAT'S MORE OF A- IT DOESN'T IT DOESN'T EXIST- IT DEPENDS ON THE COUNTIES IT DEPENDS ON THE TRIBES- IT DEPENDS ON THE ISSUE- TO WHAT BRINGS EVERYONE TOGETHER- AS FAR AS- MISSING PERSONS- I WOULD ACTUALLY DIFFER YOU TO SHARE CONSUL- HUMBLE COUNTY HAS BEEN- AN EXCELLENT PARTNER- IT TO THE SURROUNDING TRIBES- AS FAR AS- AT OTHER COUNTY SAN DIEGO COUNTY- HAS BEEN VERY EFFECTIVE- IN THEIR TRIBAL OUTREACH AND BUILT REBUILDING RELATIONSHIPS- WITH THE SAN DIEGO TRIBES- AS WELL AS RIVERSIDE. COUNTY RIVERSIDE AND SAN DIEGO COUNTY COMBINED I REPRESENT A THIRD OF THE TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA- THEY BOTH HAVE A LARGE QUANTITY OF TRIBES AND THEY HAVE BOTH BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY IN REBUILDING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND BUT AGAIN IT'S ON ISSUE SPECIFIC- THAT THAT DRIVES THOSE COLLABORATIONS- SO GO AHEAD SHARE CONSUL. SO WHAT WE DO NUMBER COUNTIES HAVE A AROUND MEETING AND THE DEEP DISH ATTORNEY HOST A ROUNDTABLE MEETING AND ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT PARTNERS ALL TRIBES REPRESENTED. AT THE AT THE ROUND TABLE MEETING AND IT'S A VERY BENEFICIAL- COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO GETTING ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS TOGETHER DISCUSSPROBLEMS WHILE THEY'RE STILL SMALL WELL WHILE THE QUESTIONS ARE STILL SMALL TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE THINGS AND- AND SO IT DOES WORK WELL- WE DO ME EATS. ON A ONE ON ONE BASIS WITH TRIBAL POLICE SHE'S SO SHE XIN DOJ STATE SHERIFFS- YOU KNOW BUT HAVING A COLLECTIVE MEETING ALTOGETHER- IS SOMETHING THAT WE PROBABLY CAN DO A MAKE THAT ARRANGEMENT AND TODAY ESPECIALLY IN SOON AGE. YOU KNOW WE CAN PULL THIS OFF AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT- ALL ON TALK TO MARY ABOUT AND MAYBE EVEN REGIONALLY I MEAN AS YOU SAID IT'S COUNTY BY COUNTY I'M FROM ORANGE COUNTY AND- YOU KNOW I'M GOING TO ASSUME BUT I DON'T KNOW. THAT WE HAVE MAYBE LESS ISSUES AND SAY RIVERSIDE OR OTHER AREAS BUT THAT CERTAINLY DOES NOT MEAN WE DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES AND IT COULD ALSO MEAN THAT WHEN THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS WHO GO MISSING THEY AND SOFTWARE. AND IT'S SO IT'S IN ALL OF OUR BENEFIT TO UNDERSTAND. THE ISSUE AND TO MAKE SURE OTHERS DO AS WELL- BUT I THINK. REMOTE OPPORTUNITIES REALLY GIVE A WHOLE KIND OF REGIONAL STATEWIDE OPPORTUNITY TO- CONVENE AT SOME POINT. IF I MAY ADD I WOULD SAY THAT I'M THE TYPE OF RESEARCH FIRST EVE. I STATE PROJECT WE ACTUALLY STARTED THE PROJECT ON THE EVE OF THE PANDEMIC SO HAD IN A VERY DIFFERENT. AND HAD TO STILL JUMP IN AND ESTABLISH THE SCOPE AND SEVERITY AND- FOR TWENTY NINETEEN LATE TWENTY NINETEEN TO NOW. WE HAVE SEEN THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN OUR PROJECT- THE COUNTY SHERIFF'S IT'S BOTH WAYS WHEN WE NEED HELP. WE CAN CALL AND VICE VERSA AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A REAL TEMPLATE TO MODEL I DON'T WANT TO SINGLE ANYONE OUT BUT I WILL SAY THAT IN THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT WE INTERACTED WITH A VARIETY OF COUNTIES. MANY DIFFERENT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THAT WAS NOT ALWAYS THE RESPONSE THAT WHEN WE CALLED AND ASKED FOR THEIR TIME THAT WE WERE SEEN. AS WORTHY OF THAT TIME OR OR SOMETIMES THE- WE WERE COMING IN A GOOD WAY I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHEN TRIBES COME TO COLLABORATE ON THIS ISSUE. THEY ARE COMING TO BRING RESOURCES IN TO HELP AND HAVING A RECEPTIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OPEN TO THAT HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL AND I HOPE THAT WE CAN SHARE FROM THOSE LESSONS IN OUR YEAR THREE REPORT. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ON ON PANEL ONE- THANK YOU FOR YOUR- YOUR COMMENTS HERE FROM THE- THERE COMMITTEE. AS WE TRANSITION TO PANEL TO. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ASSEMBLY MEMBER- REGGIE JONES SAWYER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER EDUARDO GARCIA. ASSEMBLY WOMAN SHARON QUIRK-SILVA.

THANK YOU TONY GENERAL BONTA FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT TO THE AMERICAN INDIAN PEOPLE AND- AND- THANK YOU DIRECTOR OF THE AMERICAN AFFAIRS MERRY LOPEZ KEY FOR INVITING. ME TO SPEAK ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA ADVOCACY EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES MINERAL NUMBER OF ROUND VALLEY AND I'M A U. Q. DESCENDANT. TODAY I REPRESENT THE WORK I DO AS DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND PROJECTS AT THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM FOR URBAN INDIAN HEALTH LEADING THE RED WOMAN RISING PROJECT. AND THIS PROJECT IS TO BRING ATTENTION TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL VIOLENCE MMI P. AND ALSO BRING ATTENTION TO JUST VIOLENCE. AGAINST OUR ENVIRONMENT AND- AND I AND I OFTEN SAY THAT BECAUSE- WE HAVE TO HONOR THAT CONNECT CONNECTION BETWEEN THE ENVIRONMENT AND  VIOLENCE THAT- HAS BEEN PUT ON OUR ENVIRONMENT TO THE WATER TO THE LAND WHICH IS. IMPORTANT TO OUR TRAVEL RELATIVES- CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO ONE OF THE LARGEST HOLOCAUSTS IN HISTORY THAT IS KNOWN TO CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE AS THE GOLD RUSH. OUR STATE GAVE WHITE SELLERS PERMISSION TO KIDNAP TRAPPING IN SLAVE AMERICAN AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN. AND THAT'S KNOWN AS IN MY P. BUT PEOPLE STILL REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND BELIEVE THAT THIS HISTORY EVER EXISTED IN CALIFORNIA. MANY OF US HAVE ANCESTORS WHO ARE PART OF THE BOARDING SCHOOL AREA HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND STILL CARRY THAT GENERAL GENERATIONAL TRAUMA. FROM THE THEIR ANCESTORS EXPERIENCES A BOARDING SCHOOLS WHEN- PEOPLE TODAY WONDER WHY- WE CALIFORNIA ARE ONE OF THE TOP STATES- OF THE HAVE THE HIGHEST IN MY P. WE KNOW IT IS BECAUSE OF THAT DARK HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA- IN THAT. INDIAN GENOCIDE AND I HONOR MY GRANDMOTHER ADELINE FULL WIDER WHO IS A U. Q. DESCENDANT WHO IS ALSO. A SURVIVOR OF BOARDING SCHOOL. SO I AM ONE OF MANY ADVOCATES HERE IN CALIFORNIA- IT'S HONOR TO BE HERE AND SAY THAT I DO THIS WORK THIS WORK IS VERY PERSONAL- I HAVE LOST FRIENDS. JESSICA ALBA- WHO WAS MURDERED IN SAN FRANCISCO IN TWENTY NINETEEN I ALSO OWN MY NIECE- NATASHA STEEL BATIDA IN DELMAR COUNTY. WHICH WAS- SHE WAS HER DEATH WAS PRONOUNCED A DROWNING WITH NO INVESTIGATION. BUT SO PLEASE READ WOMAN RISING PROJECT- YOU KNOW IS REALLY FOCUSED ON URBAN INDIAN POPULATIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA SICKLY REPRESENTS TEN OF OUR URBAN INDIAN HEALTH- PROGRAMS HERE. AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT- IT EVEN THOUGH WE LIVE IN URBAN COMMUNITIES WE ARE STILL TRIBAL PEOPLE WERE STILL CONNECTED TO- TO OUR TRIBES AND HAVE FAMILY THAT- COME INTO URBAN COMMUNITIES FOR SAFETY FOR PROTECTION. AND FOR RESOURCES. SO OF THE RED ROOM AND RISING PROJECT IS REALLY A WAY TO- UP LIFT VOICES OF OUR SURVIVORS AND WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO- TO CREATE. A TV NETWORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS- A NETWORK THAT MEETS- OF MONTHLY AND QUARTERLY. AND THAT'S JUST TO CREATE VISIBILITY WITHIN ALL OF ORGANIZATIOS TO SHOW WHAT WORK THEY'RE DOING WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES. WE ALSO- PROVIDE A LOT OF RESOURCES SUCH AS OUR READ WOMAN RISING WEBSITE FOR SURVIVORS WE HAVE OR DIGITAL STORIES THAT WE'VE WE'VE- TALKED TO SURVIVORS ABOUT OUR POLICY ADVOCACY WORK. AND DIRECT EMERGENCY SERVICES THE COOLEY IS NOT AN EMERGENCY A SERVICE ORGANIZATION BUT WE FOUND THAT ESPECIALLY DURING COPA NINETEEN WE HAD TO PROVIDE DIRECT SERVICE IN FUNDING FOR SHELTERS AND HOTEL ROOMS FOR SURVIVORS. WHO WERE- WHO NEEDED TO BE HOUSED FOR PROTECTION. WE ARE STRONG PARTNER I'M HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A PARTNERS WITH IN A TRIBAL COUNCIL CALIFORNIA THE STRONGER NEED WOMEN'S COALITION WHO WE REFER A LOT OF OUR- SURVIVORS TO. AND AND ALSO WITH THE OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR. INDIGENOUS PEOPLE HERE IN SACRAMENTO THAT WE OFTEN PARTNER WITH AS WELL. CURRENTLY WE ARE- CREATING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- REPORT WHICH IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL SCAN OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FOR CALIFORNIA AMERICAN POPULATIONS AND THAT IS WITH- THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO THIS STATE WAY DATA- REPORT BECAUSE WE NEED THIS DATA TO FOR POLICY CHANGE AND UCSF HAS BEGUN TO. OUTLINED IDENTIFIED GAPS IN STATE WIDE TV DATA FOR AMERICAN INDIAN POPULATIONS HERE IN CALIFORNIA IN THIS REPORT WE'RE WORKING ON WE FOUND THINGS THAT SET OUT IN THE RISKS AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS AND ROOT CAUSES OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AMONG AMERICAN IN COMMUNITIES. SO THERE ARE A LOT OF COMMON THEMES ENVIRONMENTAL SCAN AMONG AMERICAN INDIAN VICTIMS- THAT WERE FAMILIAR TO THE TV NETWORK AS WELL SO THIS DATA IS IMPORTANT AGAIN LIKE I SAID TO CREATE THIS POLICY CHANGE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO- INCREASE WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASE. IN HOMELESSNESS- FOR INDIGENOUS WOMEN ESPECIALLY DURING THIS TIME OF COBIT YOU SEEN THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOT OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED- WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF FINANCIAL VIOLENCE THAT HAPPENED WITH ARE WOMEN THAT HAVE BEEN- HOMELESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO STAY IN A- UNHEALTHY RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE HOUSING. OR A FAMILY TO SUPPORT THEM THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE IN- TRAFFICKING AMONG OUR- NATIVE PEOPLE HEARING CALIFORNIA DURING THIS TIME A COVE IT WE'VE ALSO SEEN. AN INCREASE IN THE VIOLENCE AGAINST OUR NATIVE WOMEN BY OUR OWN NATIVE PEOPLE. SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT- WE EDUCATE A LOT OF OUR CITY AND COUNTY PARTNERS AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE GOALS THAT SECRETOS IS REALLY ENCOURAGING OTHER COMMUNITIES TO PARTNER WITH THEIR CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIALS TO CREATE BETTER RESOURCES- WE'VE PARTNERED WITH- THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN SAN FRANCISCO WE MET WITH THEM ABOUT IDENTIFYING OUR NATIVE POPULATIONS WE ALSO HAVE A NATIVE TASK FORCE WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT TO ADVISE AND WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT- EDUCATING THEM ON AMERICAN COMMUNITY MMI P. TRAINING FOR CULTURAL HUMILITY- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO PARTNER WITH OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CREATING THESE TASK FORCE. SO THAT THEY'RE HEARING FROM THE NATIVE ADVOCATES. WE ALSO- CONTINUE TO EDUCATE OUR CITY OFFICIALS THROUGH PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IN MY P. IS AN EPIDEMIC BUT IT'S ALSO A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. AND THAT'S TAKING OVER URBAN AND TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. OUR ADVOCATES ARE ALSO WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO EDUCATE THEM ON MMI P. AND TRAFFICKING AMONG YOUNG GIRLS ADDRESSING SEXUAL VIOLENCE IN SCHOOL. WE WORKS- HAS BEEN WORKING ON A HEALTH RESOLUTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN SAN FRANCISCO- IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION FOR RECENT ETHNIC DATA STANDARDS FOR SAN FRANCISCO CITY AND COUNTY. A SICKLY IS ALSO WORKING WITH THE START OF JUSTICE FOR INDIGENOUS PEOPLE TO CREATE A GUARANTEED INCOME PILOT PROGRAM THIS IS THE FIRST EVER- OF ANYTHING THAT I'VE HEARD- AND THIS IS GOING TO PROVIDE STABLE INCOME FOR SURVIVORS. SO THAT SURVIVORS CAN CHOOSE THEIR OWN PLAN TO CARE FOR THEIR OWN HEALING BECAUSE RIGHT NOW A LOT OF OUR SURVIVORS HAVE TO GO- TWO CLINICS TO SEE SAY. THE CLINICIAN WHO MAY NOT BE A TRADITIONAL PERSON SO THEY'LL SEEK TRADITIONAL HEALING OUTSIDE IN THIS WAY THEY'LL BE ABLE TO- CREATE OUR OWN PLANET KERR WITH THIS OF. A GUARANTEED PILOT INCOME PROGRAM. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN AMONG OUR SURVIVORS ESPECIALLY THROUGH THIS DATA REPORT IS. IS ASKING FOR MORE TRAINING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT- A LOT OF OUR SURVIVORS ARE AFRAID TO COME FORWARD OR CALL THE POLICE WHEN SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE OF. THE STEREOTYPES THAT HAPPEN OR THE WAY THEY ARE TREATED- BY LAW ENFORCEMENT SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO HAVE THAT TRAINING AND THAT THESE TRAININGS MUST INCLUDE INFORMATION ON HOW TO ACCURATELY- WORK WITHIN OUR INDIAN COMMUNITIES. AND ALSO DOCUMENT- VICTIMS RAISED THEIR TRAVEL FILIATION AND- JUST HAVING THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BACKGROUND INTO BEING TRAUMA INFORMED TO WORK WITH THEM IN A GOOD WAY. ALSO WE ASK FOR MANDATED REPORTING TO OUR TRIBAL NATIONS AND REPORT OF ANY HOMICIDE OF MISSING PERSONS IF THEIR TRAVEL CITIZEN OR AFFILIATED- MAKING SURE THAT OUR TRIBES ARE- AT THE FOREFRONT INVOLVED IN THESE CONVERSATIONS- WE ASK FOR. YOU KNOW MAKING SURE THAT THE FUNDING IS FOR- THESE EFFORTS FOR MMI P. EFFORTS ARE INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS AND THAT THE TRIBES ARE OFTEN BEARING THE BRUNT OF THESE COSTS AND ALSO OUR- OUR LOCAL GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF COST FOR FLYERS AND BILLBOARDS AND TRYING TO ORGANIZE PEOPLE TO GET OUT AND LOOK FOR OUR RELATIVES. IN IT COSTS A LOT OF MONEY WE YOU KNOW WE KNOW GAS IS SO EXPENSIVE BUT TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO COME TOGETHER AND LOOK FOR THE RELATIVES SAY FOR EVEN IN SAN FRANCISCO CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT. BUT CREATING FUNDING SO THAT SO THAT WE CAN- PAY FOR THOSE COSTS VICTIMS RESOURCE CENTER FOR MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS PEOPLE- IN FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA IS SO NEEDED THIS CENTER COULD BE COULD PROVIDE. MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT CRISIS ASSISTANCE TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE WITH LODGING FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE TRAVELING FROM OUT OF THE AREA TO LOOK FOR THEIR LOVED ONES. A RESOURCES FOR AT RISK INDIGENOUS YOUTH A LARGE PORTION OF MMI P. CASES IN CALIFORNIA ARE TEENS AND CHILDREN AND REQUESTING DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES FOR AT RISK INDIGENOUS. USED TO BETTER PROTECT THEM. AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE TASK FORCE THAT IS SO CRUCIAL I THINK IN OUR TRAVEL COMMUNITIES IN URBAN COMMUNITIES CREATING THIS STATE WORK STATEWIDE TASK FORCE. WHICH INVOLVES A NATIVE WAYS NATIVE FAMILIES INDIGENOUS SURVIVORS. OF TRAFFICKING AND PARTNERING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER WE HAVE TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT- YOU KNOW ALL OF THESE- SUGGESTIONS OUT- I'VE SHARED TODAY A REALLY A PART OF THE HEALING AND- THIS CONVERSATION IS A PART OF THAT HEALING IT'S BRINGING US TOGETHER. SO THAT WE CAN COME TOGETHER AND IN HERE WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO HEAL OUR COMMUNITIES TO FILL OUR PEOPLE AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO- ASSEMBLY MEN- RAMOS AND EVERYONE HERE. AND JUST APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO SIT ON THIS PANEL WITH- THESE CALIFORNIA INDIAN WOMEN LEADERS HERE TODAY SO THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. NEXT WILL GO TO- CHAIRWOMAN JANET BILL OF THE PICAYUNE RANCHERIA OF THE CHANCE THE INDIANS. HELLO HILLI HILLI AND GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRPERSON RAMOS CHAIRPERSON GARCIA. AND MEMBERS OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN CAUCUS WOMEN'S CAUCUS. AND THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS. MY NAME IS JANET K. BILL I AM THE CHAIR PERSON FOR THE PICKING RANCHERIA OF THE CZECH CHANCY INDIANS WHICH IS A FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED INDIAN TRIBES LOCATED IN COARSE GOLDCALIFORNIA. IT IS AN HONOR FOR ME TO BE HERE TODAY REPRESENTING MY PEOPLE. TO SHARE PERSPECTIVES ON A SUBJECT THAT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO THE LIVES AND FAMILIES OF ALL INDIGENOUS PERSONS. HOLDING THIS PUBLIC HEARING IS A GOOD FIRST STEP IN SHINING THE LIGHT ON THE VIOLENCE AGAINST INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. HOWEVER WE MUST NOT STOP HERE. WE NEED TO ENSURE WE BUILD ON TODAY'S MOMENTUM TO HAVE ACTIONABLE ITEMS TO SOLVE THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEM FOR THE FUTURE AMERICANS IS A DEADLY EPIDEMIC AFFECTING OUR MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR TRIBAL AND SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. AND THE CONCLUSION THAT THE PROBLEM RISES TO A LEVEL OF AN EPIDEMIC STATUS COMES NOT ONLY FROM THE DATA. BUT FROM WHAT TRIBES OF ALL SIZES ARE DOING TO ORGANIZE AND EDUCATE THEMSELVES AND OTHERS. ABOUT THIS EPIDEMIC. BECAUSE FRANKLY DATA IS INCOMPLETE AND INACCURATE AND DOES NOT EVEN GIVE JUSTICE TO THE TRUE SCALE OF THIS CRISIS. TRIBAL LEADERS ARE STANDING READY TO PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATOR AND THEN MINISTRATION TO MOVE FORWARD A NUMBER OF POLICIES THAT ROOTS OUT AND ENDS VIOLENCE TOWARDS INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. MY TRIBE HAS WORKED TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS BY AMENDING OUR CIVIL LAW AND ORDER ORDINANCE TO PROVIDE HARSH OVER HARSHER PENALTIES FOR THOSE WHO COMMIT ACTS OF VIOLENCE WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION. STRENGTHENING OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT BY ESTABLISHING AN ATTORNEY GENERAL POSITION WITHIN OUR GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE. PARTNERING WITH OUR LOCAL PUBLIC OFFICIALS TO ADDRESS THE JURISDICTIONAL GAPS WE FACE AND BY INCREASING EDUCATION AWARENESS INITIATIVES FOR OUR TRIBAL MEMBERS. TODAY WE ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER THE POLICY FOLLOWING POLICY ACTIONS ONE CREATE A BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION A STAKEHOLDERS TO VELOP A LONG TERM AND COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS HOLISTICALLY. RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO ONE IN STATE GOVERNMENT PRIMARILY DOING THIS WORK. TO EMPOWER AN OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY AGENCY. THAT WILL MAKE SURE THAT SOLUTIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED TO CURTAIL OR RADIC KATE THE PROBLEMS. THREE ESTABLISH A STATE WIDE ALERT SYSTEM FOR MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY PARTNER WITH TRIBES. VICTIMS RIGHTS ADVOCATES LAW ENFORCEMENT AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS OUR VOICES MUST BE HEARD TO ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THIS CRISIS AS WE ARE CURRENTLY ADVOCATING FOR CHANGE. YOU HAVE HEARD AND WILL CONTINUE TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS ISSUE. WE ARE COURAGEOUS AND DEDICATED PEOPLE FROM ORGANIZATIONS WHO GIVEN THE VOID AND OUT OF NEED. HAVE ACTED ON OUR OWN TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS WE ARE CONFRONTED WITH DIALOGUE. EXAMINE AND LEARN FROM OUR WORK OUR PROGRAMS AND OUR PEOPLE. CONSIDER IMPLEMENTING OUR LOCAL PROGRAM STATEWIDE SO OTHERS CAN BENEFIT FROM THE WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE. TAKE STOCK OF ALL THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT AND MAKING A DIFFERENCE. AND ASSESS IF ALL THE PROGRAMS TOGETHER ADDRESS THE NEED. IF THERE ARE GAPS IN THE AREAS CURRENTLY COVERED LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO PLUG THOSE GAPS TO ENSURE THAT ALL INDIGENOUS PEOPLE ARE COVERED. I AM STANDING READY TO NOT ONLY KEEP THE DIALOGUE GOING READY TO ROLL UP MY SLEEVES TO GET WORK DONE. AND WORKED TIRELESSLY WITH YOU AND OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT THIS HAPPENS. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WILL TAKE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US. TO COME TOGETHER AND SOLVE. THEREFORE IT IS INCUMBENT UPON TRIBES THE STATE OTHER KEY STAKEHOLDERS TO PARTNER AND WORK TOGETHER. TO MAKE THIS SILENT EPIDEMIC A TOP PRIORITY AND GIVE IT THE ATTENTION OUR PEOPLE DESERVE. THIS HEARING IS THE FIRST STEP TO THE CALL OF ACTION TO ELEVATE AWARENESS. MOTIVATE OTHERS AND BUILD MOMENTUM TO CONTINUE OUR ADVOCACY. AND ENCOURAGE OTHERS NOT TO STOP UNTIL WE ARE SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU FOR AFFORDING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. AND THANK YOU FOR PROVIDING THE PLATFORM TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE SILENT EPIDEMIC. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU AND COLLABORATIVE LEE ADDRESSING AND PREVENTING CASES OF MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT TESTIMONY AND- SOLUTIONS- BEING PRESENTED TO THIS BODY THANK YOU- CHAIRWOMAN BILL FOR IT FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. NEXT WE'LL MOVE TO- CHAIRWOMAN REGINA COULD LARA THE SHINGLE SPRINGS BAND OF MIWOK INDIANS. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR ALMOST A MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS REGINA CUELLAR CHAIRWOMAN OF THE SHINGLES RASH FOR SPRINGS BAND OF MIWOK INDIANS. DRIVES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE LONG SOUGHT SOLUTIONS TO THE EPIDEMIC OF MISSING AND MURDERED PEOPLE FROM THEIR COMMUNITIES ONE SUCH SOLUTION UTILIZED BY MY TRIBE IS A JOINT JURISDICTION COURT. IN TWENTY FOURTEEN SHINGLE SPRINGS BAND OF MIWOK INDIANS AND THE SUPERIOR COURT OF EL DORADO COUNTY MADE HISTORY BY ESTABLISHING THE FIRST JOINT JURISDICTION COURT IN THE STATE AND THE SECOND IN THE COUNTRY. IT WAS NAMED THE FAMILY WELLNESS CORE. THE COURT HAS TO JUDGES ONE FROM EACH COURT HEAR CASES INVOLVING CHILD WELFARE SUBSTANCE ABUSE. JUVENILE DELINQUENCY AND TRUANCY. BY HEARING CASES ALONG THE COUNTY THE TRIBE HAS ACCESS TO CASE INFORMATION THAT WE OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE WITH THIS INFORMATION TO TRY PROVIDE HOLISTIC AND CULTURALLY BASED CARE PLAN FOR THE CAR PURCHASE. THIS PLAN HELPS IDENTIFY AND PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR RISK FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD THE COURT PARTICIPANT INTO BECOMING A MISSING OR MURDERED. INDIGENOUS PERSON THE COURT JUDGES AND THEN HOLD THE PARTICIPANT ACCOUNTABLE FOR FIFTY FOUR FOR FILLING THE CASE PLAN THROUGH THIS JOINT PROCESS OUR PARTICIPANTS HAVE GREATER HAVE EXPERIENCE GREATER SUCCESS. THAN THOSE WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH JUST A TRIBAL OR STATE COURT SYSTEMS DO THIS DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF THE FAMILY WELLNESS COURT JUSTICE YEAR THE TRIBE SIGNED TWO AND WILL USE WITH THE COUNTY TO EXPAND THE COURTS SERVICE. TO INCLUDE A COORDINATED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COURT AND A DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE PROGRAM. I WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ENCOURAGE INCREASED SUPPORT FOR FUNDING JOIN JURISDICTION COURTS AN INVALUABLE TOOL FOR INDIGENOUS PEOPLE DESPERATELY IN NEED OF THE HEALING AND HOLISTIC APPROACH THIS COURT PROVIDES. ON THIS DAY DEDICATED TO CREATING AWARENESS OF MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS PEOPLE I'D LIKE TO COMMEND SHINGLE SPRINGS TRIBAL COURT CHIEF JUDGE VICTORIA SHAW HIS COMMITMENT AND SERVICE TO THE FAMILY WELLNESS COURT OR UN WAVERING. JUDGE BECAUSE HUMBLY DEVOTED TO ENHANCING THE SAFETY OF OUR PEOPLE AND WE THANK HIM. WE ALSO LIKE TO RECOGNIZE THE ARCHITECTS OF OUR FAMILY WELLNESS CORE HONORABLE CHRISTINE WILLIAMS FORMER CHIEF JUDGE OF THE SHINGLE SPRINGS TRIBAL COURT AND THE HONORABLE SUZANNE KINGSBURY CHOI PRESENT JUDGE OF THE SUPERIOR COURT OF EL DORADO COUNTY. THEY RECEIVED A NATIONAL GRANT FROM THE BUREAU OF JUSTICE ASSISTANCE TO CREATE THIS COLLABORATIVE COURT. ADDITIONALLY WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT TRIBES FACE UNFAIR BARRIERS TO CRIME INFORMATION DATABASES VS EIGHT NETWORKS ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL THE TRIBAL ACCESS PROGRAM TAP. IS AN AVENUE TO CRIMINAL AND THAT INFORMATION MY TRIBE IS FORTUNATE TO BE AMONG THE TRIBES SELECTED FOR ACCESS TO TAP HOWEVER THE VOID REMAINS STATE PERMISSION TO BE A. KLUTZ THE TRY ALSO RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR STATEWIDE MISSING ALERT FOR INDIGENOUS. WE ARE NOT WE ARE AT ANY. RISK TO GO. SO THE STATE NEEDS TO AN INCREASED RESPONSE OUT FIND US. ONE SUCH SOLUTION WAS JUST SIGNED INTO LAW IN WASHINGTON STATE CREATING THE FIRST IN THE NATION STATEWIDE ALERT SYSTEM FOR MISSING INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. THE LAW CREATES HOTLINE SYSTEM SIMILAR TO THE AMBER ALERTS VIA SEAN TAYLOR AND THE SILVER ALERTS. THE SYSTEM WILL NOTIFY LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN THERE'S A REPORT OF A MISSING INDIGENOUS PERSON. IT WILL ALSO PLACE MESSAGES ON HIGHWAY READER BOARDS AND ON THE RADIO AND SOCIAL MEDIA. AND WILL PROVIDE HIM FOR AND WILL PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE NEWS MEDIA. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE CREATE A SIMILAR HOTLINE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU TERM ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST PROVIDING US TO BE HERE TODAY YOU'VE BEEN AN OUTSTANDING LEADER IN BRINGING THIS CRITICAL ISSUE TO THE FOREFRONT. MM IP IS IMPORTANT NOT ONLY TO MY TRIBE BUT TWO TRIBES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION I APPRECIATE YOU SHINING LIGHT ON THE NEED TO REDUCE UNCERTAINTY. REGARDING CRIMINAL JURISDICTION AND IMPROVING PUBLIC SAFETY ON TRIBAL LANDS. WE SUPPORT YOUR INITIATIVE FOR FUNDING TO STUDY CHALLENGES RELATED TO THE REPORTING AND IDENTIFICATION OF MISSING AND MURDERED NATIVE AMERICANS IN CALIFORNIA. ESPECIALLY WOMEN AND GIRLS THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU SO MUCH- CHAIRWOMAN COOLER. THAT WOULD BRING IT TO THE COMMITTEE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. WHILE RUSSIA THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY ON A KIND OF BUILD OFF OF THE LAST- RECOMMENDATION YOU JUST MADE IT LOOK AT A CHAIR OVER HERE SAID HEY I'M GONNA I'M GONNA DO THAT BILL IS IN THERE NOW I'M A DO THAT. HE GAVE ME THE- GAME. SIDE A REAL QUICK LIKE MY- YEAR. BUT BUT ON WHAT WHAT DOES YOUR I WHEN I YOU A QUESTION ABOUT THAT YOU WE M. WE SEE THE RECOMMENDATION AND MAYBE A DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCE BUT- THIS LAST YEAR WE WERE WORKING WITH VETERANS GROUPS. AND THEY WERE RAISING THE SAME ISSUE THEY SAID YOU KNOW THERE ISN'T AN ALERT SYSTEM WHEN THERE ARE VETERANS THAT GO MISSING YOU HAVE. AN ALERT SYSTEM FOR- ELDERLY IT'S A SILVER YOU HAVE YOU KNOW THE AMBER ALERT FOR CHILDREN AND THERE MAY BE SEVERAL OTHERS. AND SO WE WERE EXCITED AND MOVING IN THE DIRECTION OF POTENTIALLY PUTTING FORWARD LEGISLATION AS RELATED TO- WHAT THEY WANTED TO CALL THE GREENER FOR VETERANS. WE ROLLED UP OUR SLEEVES AND WE STARTED TALKING TO ACTUAL VETERAN GROUPS. AND THERE WERE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THAT. THEY WERE CONCERNED AS IT RELATES TO VETERANS WHO SUFFER FROM PTSD AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THAT THE MINUTE THAT WE PUT OUT A NUMBER- LOOKING FOR A VETERAN THAT THAT CAN ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY. ADVERSE AFFECT. APPLES AND ORANGES DIFFERENT POPULATIONS DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES. JUST WONDERING IF THERE ARE ANY THOUGHTS ON. ON PROS AND CONS OF THE ALERT SYSTEM I CAN'T THINK OF ANY. I THINK IT WOULD ALL BE A VERY GOOD TO CREATE THE WORD IS A SOMEONE IS MISSING- FROM THE RESERVATION. BUT RIGHT AWAY WE PUT THE BRAKES. RIGHT AWAY WE PUT THE BRAKES ON THAT ISSUE BECAUSE OF FROM SPEAKING TO- YOU KNOW THE VETERANS DIRECTLY THEY SAID. THAT MAY NOT BE A GOOD IDEA RIGHT SO I DON'T SEE ANY ANY- OTHER REASONS WHY NOT TO DO THIS BUT I'VE JUST WILL I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA THAT'S WHY BRING IT UP AND- AND I THINK THAT'S WHY THE CHAIRMAN CAME IN THE STING CARE QUICK. THEY'LL RUN WITH IT BUT WE'RE GOING TO WORK IN PARTNERSHIP IN REGARDS. IT DEFINITELY IS- ANYBODY WANNA TRY AND I'LL JUST- QUICK SAY SOMETHING QUICK- THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I SEE NOTHING BUT PROS FOR IT I DON'T SEE ANY CONS AND AGAIN IT COULD BE- SOME OF OUR TRIBAL PEOPLE ARE VERY- RELUCTANT TO TELL THOSE STORIES BUT I THINK JUST- PUTTING ALERT ALERT LETTING THEM KNOW THAT SOMEBODY'S MISSING I DON'T SEE ANY CONS TO THAT AT ALL AND MAYBE MY OTHER. TRAVEL HOW ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION THERE MAY BE SOME NEGATIVES BUT I'M WE CAN'T SPEAK FOR EVERY INDIGENOUS PERSON HERE BUT THE POSITIVES FAR OUTWEIGH THOSE- AGAIN IT'S NOT NECESSARILY. FOR THAT SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL THAT HAS GONE MISSING BUT ALSO THEIR FAMILIES IT'S ANOTHER WAY TO ALSO RELIEVE PRESSURE FROM THEM THAT THEY'RE NOT ALONE WE HAVE A STATEWIDE SYSTEM OUR STATE LEGISLATORS. LEGISLATORS CARE ENOUGH ABOUT THIS ISSUE TO IMPLEMENT SOME TYPE OF ALERT SO AGAIN IT'S NOT ONLY THE PERSPECTIVE OF THOSE WHO HAVE GONE MISSING BUT THEIR FAMILIES THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA. ASSEMBLY WOMAN SHARON QUIRK-SILVA. I THINK ONE OF THE AFFECT OF USES OF THE LURCH IS THAT WE KNOW THAT- YOU HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF FINDING SOMEBODY- THAT IS MISSING WITHIN THE FIRST TWENTY FOUR TO FORTY EIGHT HOURS AND THAT'S WHY IT HAS BEEN SO EFFECTIVE SO I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY POSITIVE. BUT I ALSO WANTED TO THANK ALL OF YOU ON YOUR TESTIMONY BECAUSE YOU DID INDEED ANSWER SOME OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE FIRST PANEL THAT I HADN'T HEARD ABOUT- NORMALLY THE CROSS JURISDICTION BUT SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS. AS WITH THE BLUE RIBBON PANEL ON THE ACCOUNTABILITY- AND ALSO STATE WIRE ALERT THOSE ARE A VERY SUCCINCT AND I THINK THEY'RE VERY DOABLE SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU- ASSEMBLY MEMBER REGINALD SELECT YES I WANT TO THANK YOU- NOT ONLY FOR HIS TESTIMONY BUT BRINGING TO US- A SOLUTION- I SERVE WITH ONLY IS CHAIR PUBLIC SAFETY BUT I'M ALSO ON PUBLIC SAFETY BUDGET. AND THE CHAIR PUBLIC SAFETY BUDGET IS ALSO CRISTINA GARCIA WHOSE TO CHAT THE LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S CAUCUS. WEST BLUE CREEK BUT AS THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION YOU OVERSIGHT AGENCY- THE SYSTEM WIDE EMERGING SYSTEM OF. TRYING TO CREATE A PARTNERSHIP TO TRY TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OUTSIDE AGENCY OR EVEN A JOINT JURISDICTIONAL COURT YOU KNOW THE FAMILY WELLNESS COURSES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT STATEWIDE WILL PROBABLY NEED FUNDING- AND SO I WILL MAKE. AND I WILL PROBABLY. I WILL MAKE A COMMITMENT FOR THE CHAIR THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS THAT IF YOU COME TO US THIS PRESS WOOD MAY REVISE- IT MAY BE TOUGH BUT IF YOU COME TO US. WITH KIND OF A- A BUDGET REQUEST BUT WHAT YOU THINK WE WOULD NEED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN IS JUST A STARTED AND STOPPED I GIVE YOU THIS EXAMPLE WHEN I CAME ON IN TWENTY TWELVE- THERE WERE VERY FEW- I'LL CALL BOUTIQUE COURTS. THERE WERE ANY. GIVEN OF COURSE THERE WERE DRUG. HOMELESS COURTS WHEN IT GIVE THAT THEIR PLASTER- NOW BECAUSE WE PUT MONEY TOWARD. AND WE FORCED TO DO JUST SYSTEM- TO LOOK AT EVERYBODY SEPARATELY NOT AS ONE BIG GROUP SO- IF YOU GET TOGETHER. AND MAYBE EVEN TALK WITH- TO CHAIRMAN DID COMMITTEE- ABOUT WHAT YOUR NEEDS ARE AND MAY WE CAN. QUICKLY TRY TO. IT'S SERVER CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN. IS IT TAKES MONEY. OUT OF WITH YOU. AND I'M NOT TRYING TO OUR MONEY BUT WE HAVE A SAY EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS BUT I'M JUST PUTTING IT OUT THERE. AND- BUT IT DID BUT YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING OUT TO YOU ASK- THAT THAT SO I'M JUST OFFERING THAT- FROM DAY OF SEPT FIVE CHAIR ANDREW AND MYSELF WHO SIT ON BUDGET SO BY. THE END WE DEFINITELY WILL THANK YOU- THANK% YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT- ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM- COMMITTEE MEMBERS GERMAN JONES SAWYER BEFORE THAT AND CRISTINA GARCIA WE'RE DOING THIS HEARING OF IT ALL DAY IT SAYS DAVID IS IN CONJUNCTION WITH WOMEN'S CAUCUS SO DEFINITELY- WILL MAKE APPOINTMENTS- WITH- CHAIRMAN REGGIE JONES SAWYER AND BRING THOSE FORWARD. AND I THINK THAT ONE OF THE TOPICS THAT WE COULD TALK ABOUT- WHICH IS CAME UP HERE AND REOCCURRING IS SOME TYPE OF AN ALERT SYSTEM AND- WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND START THE DIALOGUE ON THAT WITH THE FEATHER ALERT IS WHAT WE COULD CALL THAT- EDUARDO- MY GOOD FRIEND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA. OF FEATHER ALERT AS WELL AS GETTING FUNDING FOR THAT TO MOVE FORWARD I THINK IT'S QUESTIONS AT- WHERE SOME OF RAN INTO SOME OBSTACLES WITH TRYING TO PUT SOMETHING FORWARD BUT- CHAIRWOMAN- BILL SAID IT SO ELOQUENTLY THAT THE PROS DO OUTWEIGH THE CONS IN IN THE SITUATION THAT'S HERE. SO WE LOVE TO WORK- WITH ALL THOSE IN OUR COLLEAGUES HERE TO START TO MOVE OR AND DISCUSS THAT. OF. A FEATHER ALERT HERE IN THIS OF CALIFORNIA MISSING MURDERED. INDIGENOUS WEAPON EMISSION. MURDERED INDIGENOUS PERSONS AND MISSING PERSONS- FROM. INDIAN COMMUNITIES AND TRIBAL COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND MANY INDIAN RESERVATIONS HAVE A POPULATION THAT RESIDE ON THE RESERVATION. BUT MANY- PHILLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES HAVE POPULATIONS IS STILL LIVE WITHIN THE URBAN. COMMUNITIES AND ALL OF CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBES- LIVE WITHIN THE URBAN AREAS THEMSELVES WE'VE ALSO HEARD- FROM PRIOR TESTIMONY THAT GOING FURTHER. INTO THE BOXES AT LAW ENFORCEMENT AND- PROSECUTORS ARE CHECKING OFF AS FAR AS IDENTIFYING NATIVE AMERICAN. BAR THAT WOULD BE JENNIFER TRY THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY ROM YOUR- BECAUSE SERRANO- WE- RIGHT- YUP IT'S GOING A STEP FURTHER TRYING TO IDENTIFY THOSE THAT WHICH BECOMES A LEARNING EXPERIENCE AN EDUCATIONAL. COMPONENT BUT WE DO SEE THAT AND THEN THE COURTS DON'T ASK A QUESTION ON THE COURSESOMEONE BROUGHT UP COURTS. AND IT DO WE ALSO SEE- WHERE- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN OLDER SYSTEM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT COLLECTING THE DATA AND WORKING WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL- FOR THE PROSECUTION OF THOSE THERE BUT THE COURTS CAME UP AND I KNOW THAT- TRAVEL- GOVERN. CORSTENS THERE. HOW COULD THE STATE JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN TRIBAL COURTS WORK TOGETHER- ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE- AS FAR AS- TRYING TO BE PREVENTIVE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT. THE DATA IS BEING SHARED WITH WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO- INVESTIGATE THESE TYPES OF SITUATIONS- I'M WHAT I LIKE TO SAID. THE A LOT. I THINK JUST- THE ACCESS TO THOSE INFORMATIONAL DATABASES YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEBODY GOES MISSING THE TRIBE WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO. THE TAB FOR THE CLIPS AND UNFORTUNATELY- AT THAT LEVEL WE DON'T HAVE ACCESS INTO. I BELIEVE I'M A KLUTZ I BELIEVE I'M SAYING IT RIGHT- BUT WE DO HAVE ACCESS INTO THE TAP- BUT I BELIEVE MAYBE MORE ACCESS FOR ALL TRIBES. NOT JUST- JUST VERY FEEL AND LIKE I SAID WE'RE VERY ONE OF THE VERY FEW TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT AND- THAT% INFORMATION IS WHEN THERE'S SOMEBODY THAT'S MISSING THAT INFORMATION GOES DIRECTLY INTO THAT DATABASE. AND IT GETS PUT OUT TO ALL TRIBAL ENFORCEMENT AND ON LAW ENFORCEMENT NOT ONLY TROUBLE BUT STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS AND I THINK AGAIN- WHEN YOU WE LIVE IN A RURAL AREA. THAT'S THE MOST VITAL TO GET OUT THAT INFORMATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE- YOU KNOW HAVE. OFFICERS AND HIGHWAY PATROL LOOKING ON FREEWAYS- BUT I THINK TO WITH THE COURTS I THINK- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON A WE'VE BEEN REALLY SUCCESSFUL HATS HOLD. ON AND I JUST DOES IT WE DON'T HAVE THAT. SOMETHING HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL FOR US. THANK YOU ANY ANY OTHER WITH WISH TO COME ON YEAH I WANTED TO SHARE THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT THERE BE A DATA SHARING AGREEMENT BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TRIBES AND YOU KNOW OUR- URBAN INDIAN HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE WE CAN'T JUST HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT HOLDING THE DATA. AS WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY THAT THERE STILL IS SOME DISTRUST THERE AND UNTIL WE HEAL THAT UNTIL WE BUILD THOSE PARTNERSHIPS THEN WE CAN HAVE- YOU KNOW A LARGER DATABASE THAT CAN- PROVIDE SUPPORT TO TWO TRIBES IN INTO EVERYONE. BUT I THINK THAT IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE WERE ABLE TO SEE- PARTNERSHIPS WITH THIS DATA SHARING SO THAT- WE CAN. BECAUSE I THINK TOO THAT'S WHERE THE TRAINING COMES BACK INTO IN MAKING SURE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS THE TOOLS TO IDENTIFY NATIVE PEOPLE AND WE SEE THAT EVEN WITHIN ARGUES WHO ARE. SAY MISSING A LOT OF TIMES- THEY HAD. THEIR LOOKED AT AS A RUN AWAY AND- IS EITHER MISIDENTIFIED AND THEN THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN DAYS AFTER GONE BY. AND THAT YOU THEIR CHILD HAS BEEN TRAFFICKED AND WE CAN'T FIND THEM SO I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GO BACK TO THOSE BASIC OF- TRAINING IT. AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY IN JUST AND- JUST PARTNERING IT AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE BUILDING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. OF TRUST HERE THANK YOU FOR THAT- CHAIRMAN BILL. IN ADDITION TO WHAT'S BEEN SET UP SO THAT THIS REMINDING ANNA DAUNTING THAT TRIBES ARE SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND MARK WE HAVE INHERENT SOVEREIGNTY WITHIN OURSELVES. A. B. WITH. MENTAL WELL. THANK SO OVER ISRAEL TO- THE SYSTEM AND WHETHER THE BARRIER THERE IS- PUBLIC LOT TO EIGHTY STATUES- AND IF SO RIGHT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE KIND OF LOOK AT IN A ERY NARROW WAY FOR PURPOSES OF COLLABORATIVE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS OR IS THE MODEL OF JUST AT MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING- THE PREFERRED METHOD OF ACTUALLY MOVING INTO THAT DIRECTION I WOULD. IMAGINE THAT UP AND DOWN THE STATE THE RELATIONSHIP WITH WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WITH RIGHT WITH LOCAL PD IS VERY DIFFERENT YOU MAY HAVE SOME FOLKS OPERATIVE YOU MAY HAVE OTHER FOLKS THAT ARE NOT AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE IS A SPECIFIC. NARAL FOCUS TYPE FIX IS IN THE CLASS DISCUSSION WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT PUBLIC CLOUD TO EIGHTY I DON'T KNOW- IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD WOULD HAVE MAYBE IT UNDERSTAND BETTER YEAH THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION- I KNOW IN OUR COUNTY AND I AM AN INTAKE LIKE YOU SAID IT'S DIFFERENT IN ALL COUNTIES ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE RELATIONSHIP. A LOT HARDER- WE DID- WE DO HAVE AND WILL USE I DON'T THINK FAMILY YOU SHOULD BE WE SHOULD HAVE THOSE EMMYS I AGAIN I THINK THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUST WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION WITHOUT HAVING TO AND- I'M FOR WE. A MAN I. YOU IS WITH THE CLASS AND WHY NOT ABLE TO GET ACCESS SO THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION- BUT MAYBE- WITH THE SHERIFF I'M NOT SURE IF HE'S STILL HERE BUT MAYBE HE MIGHT HAVE SOME INFORMATION ON THAT I'D BE VERY INTERESTED IN FOLLOWING UP WITH THAT- THIS PARTICULAR CONVERSATION MIGHT MY EXPERIENCE THE- TO TRIBAL YOU KNOW WHAT GOVERNMENT WAS- UNDERSTANDING PUBLIC LAW TO EIGHTY WAS WORKING AS AN INTERN FOR A FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBE BACK HOME. AND THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO SHAKE THAT UP BUT HERE'S AN EXAMPLE WHERE THERE MAY BE AN NARAL- FOCUSED AREA FOR THE FACT OF SHARING INFORMATION AND DATA ON THIS VERY SPECIFIC CATION OF SURE IT WOULD BE APPLICABLES. A GIVEN THAT THIS IS I'M STATION TODAY I WOULD LOVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THAT GERMAN AND COLLEAGUES TO SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO FROM A LEGISLATIVE STANDPOINT. TO FREE UP WHATEVER THE- THE BLOCKAGES. IN TERMS OF-THE SYSTEMS OF COMMUNICATION BEING AVAILABLE TO OUR SOVEREIGN NATIONS. OKAY AGAIN I THINK GO TO- I THINK THE SHERIFFS ARE VERY ON EDUCATED ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY THAT IS AND I THINK THERE'S A THEY'RE A LITTLE SCARED BECAUSE THEY FEEL THEY'RE THE THEY'RE THE LAW THE LAW ON THE COUNTY AND WITH ANYBODY'S TRIBAL POLICE HAVING ACCESS I FEEL THAT THEY THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF A LITTLE WORRIED THEY'RE SCARED THEY'RE SCARED I THINK THAT'S WHY THEY DON'T ALLOW ACCESS. ON THE STATE LEVEL. EXACTLY NO JOGO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE OTHER ISSUE WITH THAT TOO IS NOT ONLY ACCESS SHARING I'M DOING I'M A I'M A USE OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT BUT BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE MENTIONED FUNDING YOU KNOW- ANOTHER ISSUE THAT LIMITS ACCESS IS BROADBAND ISSUES DO WE HAVE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT IS NECESSARY FOR TRIBES ANYTHING SUCH AS THAT THAT WOULD ALLOW US ONCE LEGISLATION IS INVOLVED IN CREATES A EASIER PATHWAY TO US TO HAVE ACCESS BUT JUST AS TECHNICAL ISSUES THAT WE WOULD ALSO NEED ASSISTANCE WITH. IN CARRYING THAT OUT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. QUESTION SOME COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS I MAKE A COMMENT. YES EXCELLENT HEARING ON THE BROADBAND I'M CHAIR OF THE COMMUNICATIONS AND CONVEYANCE SO YOU HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE HERE. RODRIGUEZ AND- WORKING GROUP CHAIR AND THE AUTHOR OF BROADBAND FOR ALL THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW THIS YEAR AND WE ARE ALREADY STARTING AYE I BELIEVE WITH AT LEAST ONE TRIED. TO GET THEM.

WHEN YOU'RE- A JURISDICTION CLOSE TO- A FEDERAL INDIAN RESERVATION TO HAVE THAT PART OF THE TRAINING TO UNDERSTAND THOSE COMPLEXITIES- MAYBE THERE'S FURTHER DIALOGUE THAT WE COULD TALK ON THAT ISSUE. ALSO BUT I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR COMING FORWARD AND OFFERING TESTIMONY OF WHAT'S TRULY GOING ON RIGHT WITHIN INDIAN COUNTRY ON THESE ISSUES AND THE REOCCURRING. THEME THAT I'VE SEEN AND HEARD A MEDIA IS ON THE STATE ALONE ALERT SYSTEM AND OTHERS USE MISSING PERSONS ALERT SYSTEM WHICH GOT ATTENTION FROM- THE MEMBERS THAT ARE HERE TODAY TO START UP THAT DIALOGUE. AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON THE FEATHER ALERT I SAID THAT THREE TIMES RIGHT FEATHER ALERT. RIGHT WE'RE GONNA START TO- DIALOGUE. ON THAT- WELL YEAH. BUT IT WAS BETTER THAN A GREENER THAT- MICHAEL. HAD SO WE'RE GOING IN THE RIGHT TO. RIGHT IT WHICH GOES TO THE TASK FORCE THAT- BLUE RIBBON- IN LOOKING FOR SUPPORT FROM MY COLLEAGUES AS FAR AS- HOW DO WE MOVE FORWARD ON THAT BLUE RIBBON. COMMISSION THAT'S BEING- REQUESTED AS FAR AS A SOLUTION. MOVING FORWARD WE WOULD LEAN ON OUR COLLEAGUES TO HELP US ON. WHETHER THROUGH THAT AND ESTABLISH THAT SODA THANK YOU AS WE TRANSITIONED TO A PANEL THREE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU. THE PANEL THREE- THIS SERVICE. IT DEALING WITH ISSUES A PREVENTION INTERVENTION AND POLICY IDEAS. WE HAVE- CHAIRMAN JOE JAMES OF THE YUROK TRIBAL COUNCIL. WE HAVE CHAIRWOMAN ERICA PINTO OF THE HALL MOVE. INDIAN VILLAGE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE CHAIRWOMAN SARAH DUSKY OF THE I. OWN BAND OF ME WALK INDIANS TO AFTER TESTIMONY. I WANT IN THE END. SO GONNA GO AHEAD AND LEAVE IT OFF WITH CHAIRWOMAN ERICA PAINTER FROM HUMBLE THAN THE GO THEN GO TO CHAIRPERSON CHAIRMAN JOE JAMES OF EUROPE TRAVEL COUNCIL AND THEN TO- CHAIRWOMAN SARAH DUSKY OF THE I. OWN BAND ME WALK INDIANS. ALL MORE YOU CAN SWITCH IT UP ON A SYSTEM I JUST. TOOK IT IS HIS DUTY PLAN. HOW GOOD AND GOOD AFTERNOON- MY NAME IS ERICA MARIE PINTO AND I AM THE TRIBAL CHAIRWOMAN OF THE HIMALAYAN VILLAGE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE OF THE HONOR OF SERVING AS THE CHAIRWOMAN- THANK YOU. TO THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE NATIVE AMERICAN CAUCUS AND THE WOMAN CAUCUS- FOR THE INVITATION TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY TRIBAL COUNCILS HERE IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM WITH MY YOUTH TRIBAL COUNCIL SO I APPRECIATE THEIR SUPPORT HERE TODAY. IT'S TRULY AN HONOR TO JOIN ALL OF YOU IN RECOGNIZING MURDERED MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN. AND GIRLS AWARENESS. I AM INCREDIBLY HONORED TO SPEAK ALONGSIDE SUCH DISTINGUISHED TRIBAL LEADERS AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS ISSUES SURROUNDING MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS PEOPLE. I'D LIKE TO ESPECIALLY RECOGNIZE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THE ISSUE AND HIS SINCERE AND PASSIONATE COMMITMENT. TO MAKING SURE THAT WE BRING AWARENESS TO THE STATE. ABOUT THIS EPIDEMIC. SENATE ACCOUNT THIS IS WORTH NOTING BUT SADIO COUNTY IS HOME TO MORE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES THAN ANY OTHER COUNTY. AND THE HIMALAYAN VILLAGE IS JUST ONE OF THIRTEEN COMING AYE BANDS. WE TAKE OUR RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY TO CREATE A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. FOR TRIBAL MEMBERS ARE CASINO EMPLOYEES AND VISITORS. DUE TO OUR RESERVATIONS CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE US MEXICAN BORDER WE HAVE A HEIGHTENED AWARENESS OF HOW SIGNIFICANT AND IMPACTFUL THIS ISSUE IS ON OUR COMMUNITY AND HOW CRITICAL IT IS TO URGENTLY RESPOND TO INCIDENTS THAT MAY OCCUR. WITH ONLY THIRTY MINUTES BETWEEN OUR RESERVATION AND THE U. S. MEXICAN BORDER WE ARE DILIGENT IN OUR COMMITMENT TO PREVENT HUMAN TRAFFICKING. WE RECOGNIZE THAT EVERY MINUTE COUNTS SO WE TAKE A PROACTIVE APPROACH. FOR US PREVENTION STARTS WITH EDUCATION. FIRST WE'VE HELD MEETINGS WITH THE SHERIFF AND OUR TRIBAL MEMBERS OF ALL AGES ON THE ISSUE AND STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF CYBER SAFETY FOR THEMSELVES THEIR FAMILY AND OUR COMMUNITY. THIS MEANS FRANK DISCUSSIONS AND HOW TO BE SAFE ON THE INTERNET AND WIDER PORTENT THAT WE MONITOR INTERNET USAGE AND PRACTICE CYBER SAFETY. I HAVE MANY NIECES NEPHEWS AND LIKE ALL OF US THEY ENJOY THEIR DEVICES TREMENDOUSLY. SO IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE ENGAGE IN THESE OPEN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHY IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP OUR PERSONAL INFORMATION PRIVATE. USE CAUTION WHEN POSTING PICTURES. AND DO NOT INTERACT WITH PEOPLE THAT WE DON'T KNOW PERSONALLY. WE NEED TO TEACH THE SAFETY PRACTICES GENERATIONALLY AS WE HAVE MANY FAMILIES WHERE GRANDPARENTS. AUNTS AND UNCLES ARE THE PRIMARY CARETAKERS OR INVOLVED IN THE CARE OF OUR CHILDREN. WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED A POLICY REQUIRING OUR MEMBERS TO INCLUDE THEIR FINGERPRINTS ON THEIR TRIBAL ID'S. SO WE HAVE IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION SHOULD THEY GO MISSING. SECOND WE PROVIDE EXTENSIVE TRAINING FOR OUR CASINO EMPLOYEES ON HOW TO RECOGNIZE SIGNS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. WE TRAIN EVERYONE FROM FRONT LINE EMPLOYEES TO MANAGERS. WE HAVE HOSTED MULTIPLE TRAINING EVENTS ALLOWING EXPERTS TO DEMONSTRATE AWARENESS IDENTIFICATION AND PREVENTION STRATEGIES IN THE WORKPLACE. FINALLY COLLABORATION IS KEY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH A STRONG HEARTED NATIVE WOMEN COALITION- EVEN BY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR KEELY LATIN. THE ENVELOP A PROGRAM RUN BY WENDY SLATER FORMER VICE CHAIR OF LAWYER SOUTHERN INDIAN HEALTH COUNCIL AND THE INDIAN HEALTH COUNCIL. EACH WITH ALL OF PROTECTING OUR AMERICAN INDIAN PEOPLE AND PROVIDING MUCH NEEDED RESOURCES TO OUR COMMUNITIES. EACH ORGANIZATION IS IN CONTINUED COLLABORATION AND COMMUNICATION WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO BUILD UPON TRUST AND ENSURE THAT OUR TRIBAL COMMUNITY IS PROTECTED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. TOMORROW ON MAY FIFTH SPEAKING OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY IN THE MOST TRIBES. BUT IT'LL BE THE SECOND TIME THAT THEY ARE RAISING THE MMI W. FLAG FOR THE SECOND TIME IN A ROW SO I APPLIED SEND YOU COUNTY. IN ADDITION TO PREVENT. THE DEVELOPMENT OF POLICIES THAT HELP US ADDRESS THIS ISSUE ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT. THE METHODS THAT PERPETRATORS USED TO CONTINUE TO OUR CONTINUING TO EVOLVE SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR POLICIES ARE DESIGNED TO COMBAT THIS EVER CHANGING. ISSUE THAT HAS PLAGUED INDIAN COUNTRY FOR FAR TOO LONG. I WANT TO COMMEND ALSO THE STATE OF WASHINGTON WHICH WE FOR TODAY A LOT ABOUT. THE ALERT FOR SIGNING INTO LAW AN ALERT SYSTEM FOR MISSING MURDERED INDIGENOUS WOMEN AND PEOPLE. THIS IS A RAPID WAY TO ALERT THE PUBLIC ON OBJECTIONS AND POTENTIALLY SAVE LIVES. THESE ACTIONS ALSO RAISE AWARENESS AND HELP BUILD TRUST WITH TRIBAL COMMUNITIES. THESE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS ACROSS VARIOUS AGENCIES MEANS THAT WE WILL ALL BECOME FIERCE PROTECTORS AND ADVOCATES ON THE FRONT LINES OF OUR COMMUNITY'S FIGHT AGAINST SEX TRAFFICKING OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE. THE HUMBLE INDIAN VILLAGE SERVES AS A PLACE FOR MY COMMUNITY TO PRESERVE AND PRACTICE TO HERITAGE AND CULTURAL TRADITIONS OF OUR ANCESTORS. A REMAIN COMMITTED TO BUILDING BRIDGES. MAKING CONNECTIONS OUTSIDE THE TRIBAL COMMUNITIES TO ACCOMPLISH GOALS OF MUTUAL INTEREST. WHILE ENSURING THE VOICES OF TRIBAL COMMUNITIES ARE HEARD AND OUR PEOPLE ARE PROTECTED AND KEPT SAFE FOR GENERATIONS TO COME AND MIGHT TAKE THIS FEATHER ALERT A STEP FURTHER AND HOPEFULLY MAKE IT A NATION WIDE AS YOU KNOW THAT. UNITED STATES IS HOME TO FIVE HUNDRED SIXTY FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBAL NATIONS. ONLY THAT SENATE. WE ARE CLOSEST TO THE U. S. MEXICAN BORDER WHETHER YUROK TRIBE IS CLOSEST TO THE STATE NEXT DOOR SO. IT'S VERY IMPERATIVE THAT WE THOSE THOSE HOURS ARE CRITICAL THOSE MINUTES ARE CRITICAL THE COULD COST LIVES AND AN ALERT SYSTEM. NATIONWIDE WOULD REALLY HELP US ALL. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY THANK YOU- TO BE- NEXT WILL BE GOING TO THEIR JAIL J. ZERO NONE. WE ON HERE. JOHN YEAH- THAT IS THE YOU THE CHAIRMAN FROM SPEAK BEFORE I BEFORE I START MY TEST OF. YOU KNOW WHAT- A HEAVY HEAVY HERE WE'RE TALKING TODAY WITH THEIR HEART A LOT OF EMOTION BUT HERE TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND ACTIONS BUT BEFORE I OPEN UP MY TESTIMONY ABOUT OPEN UP WITH. THE PRESS. COOL COOL- OKAY- COOL COOL THANK YOU- HEY YOU. WHO WHO WE HAVE WORK LEFT. EIGHT GIVE US A GOOD AFTERNOON- MY NAME'S ADJUSTED J. SOME CHEN THE EUROPE A COMPANY VILLAGE OF STRUGGLING ON THE LOWER KLAMATH RIVER YOU KNOW I AM HONORED HERE TO BE HERE TODAY DISCUSS THE MISSING AND URGES PEOPLE CRISIS YOU CAN HEAR SOME OVERLAP HERE ON MY TESTIMONY HERE. YOUR TRAVIS IS A VITAL CULTURAL POLITICAL LEADER IN OUR REGION AND OUR TROUBLE COUNCIL COURT ARE INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED FOR DEVELOPING HOLISTIC APPROACHES FOR PEOPLE FAMILIES IN OUR COMMUNITY AT LARGE WE CONDUCTED THREE YEARS OF RESEARCH ON THESE MMO I W. P. IN OUR REGION I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT A FRAMEWORK FOR LEGISLATION ACTIONS THAT LEGISLATION. LEGISLATURE CAN YOU TAKE. WE HAS TROUBLE KNOW THE- AND FINANCIAL ARE IN NEED RESULT CRISIS IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE NEED THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT THE LEGISLATURE IN OFFICE OF GOVERNOR TO PART WITH US. WITH THE FURTHER COMMITMENTS TO PREVIOUS. TO PREVENT AND LIMIT THIS CRISIS TO CONTINUE THE GREAT WORK THEY'VE DONE ALREADY- THAT SHARE. THE FRAMEWORK INCLUDES. FIRST INITIAL LEADS TO INCLUDE LEGISLATION ELIMINATE SYSTEMIC BARRIERS TO TROUBLE COMMUNITIES. ONE SECOND IS WE NEED TO WE NEED SATE FUNDING FOR TRIBES AND TRIBAL PEOPLE FOCUSED ON A VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND SOCIAL SERVICE. WITHIN POLICY CHANGE AND REFORM WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SOME OF THE KEY AREAS FOR ROOF FOR REFORM. FIRSTLY LEGISLATION ALLOW TRIBAL POLICE IN TROUBLE COURTS TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE ENFORCE JUSTICE TO THE FULL EXTENT LAW. STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT PUBLIC SAFETY IMPROVE IMPROVE ONE TRAVEL NATIONS HAVE RESOURCE AND OF COURSE OUR OWN LOSS AND PROTECT THEIR PEOPLE. IN THE AREA AS REMOTE AND RULE AS A RESERVATION AND IN A PUBLIC LOT TO EIGHTY STATE THAT IS THIS IS CRITICAL. WE NEED LEGISLATION THAT RECOGNIZED PROBABLY SUFFERS AS PEACE OFFICE IN A CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE. AS WELL AS LEGISLATION THAT GRANTS ACCESS TO TROUBLE COURTS IN TROUBLE POLICE TO THE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT TELEKI SYSTEM ALSO KNOWN AS COLLECT. EXISTING FEDERAL. THAT TRIBES. RETAINED INHERENT SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY OVER THERE IN INCOME IN THE COUNTRY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THIRTEEN STATES. I RECOGNIZE TROUBLE LONG COURSE AT THIRTY TO WAR STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. CALIFORNIA MUST PASS A LAW TO RECOGNIZE TROUBLE POLICE AS PEACE OFFICERS SO THAT WE CAN ENFORCE OUR SOVEREIGNTY IN IN THE LAW. SECONDLY THE LEGISLATION THAT GRANTS TRUMP POLICE OFFICERS AND TRIBAL COURT ACCESS TO THE TO THE CALIFORNIA LAW ENFORCEMENT TELL BECAUSE THIS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM. SECONDLY LEGISLATION IS TO STRENGTHEN THE COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICE RESPONSE WHEN INDIGENOUS CHILDREN GO MISSING FROM FOSTER CARE. WE KNOW THAT FOSTER CARE IS SADLY A PIPELINE. THE MISSING AND MURDERED ALL YOU NEED TO MAKE AN CHILDREN ENTERING THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM AT A RATE% OF TWO POINT SEVEN TIMES AND THE REPRESENTATION IN THE POPULATION THE HIGHEST OF ANY RACIAL GROUP RIGHT NOW. WE DID NOT GET NOTICED WHEN TRAVEL CHILDREN GO MISSING FROM THEIR FOSTER CARE DESPITE STATE GUIDANCE TELLING COUNTIES OTHERWISE WE ALSO SEE TIME AND TIME AGAIN. THAT ONE FOSTER CARE COOPER FOSTER CHILDREN GO MISSING FROM FROM KERR COUNTY SOCIAL SERVICES DO NOT FILE  POLICE TO FOR A CONTACT THE POLICE DESPITE STATE GUIDANCE STATING OTHERWISE LEGISLATION IS NEEDED TO ENSURE THE STEPS ARE TAKEN SO TRY TO STEP IN AND TAKE CARE OF OUR CHILDREN. WHO GO MISSING. YOU'VE HEARD THIS WITHOUT THE DAY FIRST NEED APPROVAL ALERT SYSTEM FOR INDIGENOUS PEOPLE WHEN THEY GO MISSING A SYSTEM LIKE THE ONE JUST PASSED IN WASHINGTON STATE PERSON IS REPORTED MISSING LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY ALERT RESULTING IN DETAILS ABOUT THE PERSON BEING. BROADCAST VIA HIGHLY DIVISOR RADIO MESSAGES SCIENCE PRESS RELEASES FOR THE MEDIA AS A TRIBE LOCATED IN A RURAL COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE LACK ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY INFORMATION AND IN A PUBLIC LAW TO THIRTY EIGHT. TO THIRTY EIGHT STATE WERE JURISDICTIONAL ISSUES BRING UP CONFUSION WHEN PEOPLE GO MISSING WE NEED AN IMMEDIATE STATEWIDE ALERT. TO LOCATE THE INDIVIDUAL AND APPROVED IN CASE OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. FINALLY CERTAINLY NOT LEAST WHEN THEY LEGISLATION INCREASE FUNDING FOR TRIBAL PROGRAMS AND SERVICES RESPONSE TO THIS TO THIS CRISIS. THE FUNDING SHOULD BE HOLISTIC AS DATA SHOWED THAT A RANGE OF RISK FACTORS INCLUDING HOMELESSNESS. MENTAL HEALTH VIOLENCE AND VICTIMIZATION HUMAN TRAFFICKING SUBSTANCE ABUSE. TRANSITION FROM FOSTER CARE ARC ARE ALSO BECAUSE OF THIS CRISIS THIS LESLIE HAS A KEYPAD CAPACITY TO BOOST REGIONAL SERVICES WHICH ARE LACKING OR NONEXISTENT FOR TRIAL WHEN AREA OF HOUSING. MENTAL HEALTH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WITH TRIBAL LEADERS ARE READY TO EAGER DEVELOP CULTURE RESPONSE OF PUBLIC HEALTH UPSTREAM PREVENTION APPROACHES. WE NEED HOLISTIC AND COMPREHENSIVE FUNDING IN THE YEARS TO COME. TODAY I TRULY APPRECIATE. BEING ABLE TO PROPRI TEST ME IN FRONT OF YOU A CHAIR IN COLLEAGUES OF I THINK WE'RE AT A POINT IN TIME NOW FOR THE A LOT OF GREAT WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE IN THE COMMITTEE- WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER.

AND AGAIN WE'RE GOING TO KEEP DOING THE GREAT WORK THAT WE DO AND TO HELP OUR OUR PEOPLE BACK AT HOME. I THINK WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY.

REPETITION IS GOOD BECAUSE WE WANT TO HAMMER THE- THE MESSAGE HOME AND MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL WALK AWAY WITH THAT VERY STRONG MESSAGE- AND REALLY TAKE ACTION. THOSE THEIR PROVIDED TESTIMONY TODAY HAVE MADE SOME VERY COMPELLING REASONS FOR YOU AND OTHER STATE LEGISLATORS. TO TAKE ACTION AND A FEW VERY CRITICAL WAYS AND I'VE KIND OF SUMMER SUMMARIZE THEM INTO THREE- THREE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES FOR A WALK THROUGH. FIRST YOU'VE BEEN URGED TO KEEP THE DIALOGUE GOING TO KEEP THE HEARINGS GOING AND TO KEEP THE EDUCATIONAL AWARENESS GOING. THAT CONTINUE DIALOGUE IS IMPERATIVE TO RESOLVING THIS CRISIS WE MUST KEEP INVESTIGATING WE MUST KEEP WORKING TO IDENTIFY THE UNDERLYING CAUSES AND UNDERSTAND pJUST THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA'S INDIAN COUNTRY BUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AS A WHOLE BECAUSE AS SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES IS TESTIFIED TO YOU BEFORE TO. TODAY SOME OF OUR INDIGENOUS WOMEN AND- MEMBERS ARE GOING MISSING FROM URBAN AREAS NOT JUST RESERVATION OR RURAL AREAS AUTHORITY AND THE PLATFORM TO DRILL DOWN AND IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP PROGRAMS TO RESOLVE THIS CRISIS AND TO DEVELOP PROCESSES TO EVALUATE HOW EFFECTIVELY THESE PROGRAMS ARE ADDRESS IN THERE CRISIS ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO WE CAN'T JUST ADOPT PROCESSES AND WALK AWAY FROM THE ISSUE THIS IS GOING TO BE ITERATIVE IT'S GOING TO BE ON GOING. AND IT NEEDS TO BE DYNAMIC. YOU THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE AND WE TRIBAL LEADERS HAVE THE POWER AUTHORITY AND I'D ARGUE THE DUTY. TO CALL ON OTHER TRIBAL NATIONS GOVERNMENTOFFICIALS ADVISED CÁC GROUPS EDUCATORS- TO GET EDUCATED ON THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS CRISIS. PUT SIMPLY WE CAN'T RESOLVE IT. WITHOUT A KEEN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S OCCURRING WHERE IT'S OCCURRING HOW IT'S OCCURRING AND WHY IT'S OCCURRING. HOLDING AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING SUCH AS THIS ONE ON A MORE FREQUENT BASIS WILL HELP TO ELEVATE PUBLIC AWARENESS ABOUT THIS CRISIS AND CONTINUE TO ENHANCE ALL OF OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE ROLES RESPONSIBILITIES AND COORDINATION THAT CAN SHOULD AND MUST OCCUR BETWEEN TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO PUBLIC AGENCIES AS WELL AS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND VICTIM. ADVOCACY GROUPS. IT IS ONLY FROM THE FAT VANTAGE POINT THAT BETTER INFORMED DECISION MAKING MOMENT IN TIME WITH ALL THE ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE I BELIEVE THERE ARE VERY PROMISING OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN CAPITALIZE UPON TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS THE FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS OTHER STATES AS WE'VE HEARD ABOUT TODAY AND EXPERTS EXPERTS IN THE FIELD AND THE BOOTS ON THE GOUND TACKLING THIS ISSUE ON AN EVERYDAY BASIS ARE COMMITTED TO RESOLVING THE CRISIS AND READY AND WILLING TO SERVE. THROUGH CONVERSATIONS AND HEARINGS IN THE CAPITAL AND IN EVERYBODY'S VARIOUS DISTRICTS AND HOMELANDS. WE CAN IDENTIFY SOLUTIONS AND BEST PRACTICES THAT WILL MAKE TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE IN PROTECTING NATIVE PEOPLES FAMILIES AND ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. THROUGH THOSE CONVERSATIONS IN HEARINGS WE CAN IDENTIFY THE GAPS THAT NEED TO BE FILLED THROUGH THOSE CONVERSATIONS IN HEARINGS WE CAN EDUCATE ONE ANOTHER IN THE PROCREATION SEASON DEPARTMENT AND CALIFORNIA CITIZENS GENERALLY. SO THAT WE CAN AVOID BECOMING A STATISTIC OR HOW TO RESPOND IF YOUR LOVED ONES ARE SUBJECTED TO SUCH A CRIME. THE SECOND POINT THAT RESONATED WITH ME TODAY HEARING FROM FROM MY COLLEAGUES. IS THAT POLICIES ARE NEEDED. IMMEDIATELY TO PROVIDE SHORT TERM RELIEF. THEIR INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS PEPPERED THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO ADDRESS THE EPIDEMIC AND WE'VE HEARD ABOUT MANY OF THEM TODAY THESE EFFORTS CAN AND SHOULD BE REPLICATED QUICKLY AND IN EARNEST IN THIS REGARD THEIR SURPLUS FUNDS IN THE STATE'S BUDGET. AS A ONE ASSEMBLY MANAGER MEMBERS MENTION TODAY I'M NOT GOING TO FORGET THAT- THAT CAN QUICKLY IT COULD BE EXPANDED- TO IMPLEMENT MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS. AND OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING OPERATED STATEWIDE OR THAT SHOULD BE OPERATED. AS WE LEARN WHAT WORKS TO RESOLVE THIS CRISIS. PUTTING IT SIMPLY WE ALL NEED TO WORK TO FIX THE PLANE MID FLIGHT HERE BECAUSE WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANOTHER OPTION- WE NEED TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TRIBES PUBLIC AGENCIES COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ADVOCACY GROUPS ALL THE GROUPS THAT WE'VE ALL HEARD FROM TODAY GROUPS THAT WE'VE ALL MENTIONED- TO COME UP WITH THE SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS. RIGHT NOW- I GUESS THE THIRD CATEGORY- OF KIND OF POLICIES AND IDEAS WE'VE HEARD ABOUT. OUR STRATEGIES. THAT ARE AIMED AT LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESSING THIS CRISIS AND I. ARE YOU MY PAPER HERE AS PEOPLE ARE TALKING I MADE SCRIBBLES EVERYWHERE AND I HOPE I CAN READ IT WHEN I GO HOME- AT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE YOU HAVE THE POWER TO LEGISLATE A LONG TERM STRATEGY HERE. AND WE CAN HELP YOU. YOU'VE HEARD FROM SEVERAL OF MYCOLLEAGUES TODAY ABOUT SOME REALLY INCREDIBLE IDEAS- AND GOTTEN SOME GREAT ADVICE ON WHAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO TO FIX THE SOLUTION LONG TERM. MY FELLOW CHAIRPERSON- BILL FROM CHUCK CHANCY SHE MENTIONED THE CREATION OF A BLUE RIBBON COMMITTEE. WHICH BUILDING ON THE CURRENT WORK BEING UNDERTAKEN BY DOJ AND THREE ZERO NINE NINE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS I'M COULD WORK TO INVESTIGATE AND FULLY ASSESS THE SCALE AND SCOPE OF THE CRISIS FURTHER IDENTIFY THE UNDERLYING ISSUES AND RECOMMEND BEST PRACTICES AND SOLUTIONS TO ESTABLISH THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITIES TO PREVENT THE ATROCITIES THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING TO THIS EPIDEMIC ON AN ONGOING BASIS. MY FELLOW CHAIRPERSON REGINA CUELLAR FROM SHINGLE SPRINGS. SHE MENTIONED SUPPORT FOR CROSS JURISDICTIONAL COURT ON A STATEWIDE BASIS THIS COULD HELP BY ITSELF SOLVE THIS PROBLEM BUT SO MANY PROBLEMS THAT PLAGUE INDIAN COUNTRY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND HELP RESOLVE SOME OF THE- MYSTERY AND MISUNDERSTANDING. SURROUNDING IMPLEMENTATION APPEAL TO EIGHTY IN THE STATE. YOU'VE HEARD FROM CHAIRWOMAN PENTA ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING ON THEIR RESERVATION TO EDUCATE THEIR YOUTH ABOUT RESPONSIBLE USE OF THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA WHICH IS ACTUALLY QUITE CRITICAL- AS WE MOVE FORWARD PROGRAMS LIKE THAT CAN AND SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED ON A STATEWIDE BASIS. YOU ALSO HEARD FROM CHAIRPERSON JAMES ARE FROM EUROPE WHO. STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT THERE BE A KEEN EYE TOWARD THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM SO THAT WE DON'T LOSE OUR CHILDREN THROUGH THAT SYSTEM IT'S ALREADY SUCH A BLOW TO OUR NATIVE COMMUNITIES TO HAVE OUR CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND TO LOSE THEM TO THIS EPIDEMIC IS EVEN MORE OF A DIFFICULT HELLO. THESE ARE JUST SOME EXAMPLES OF THE MYRIAD OF WAYS IN WHICH THE LEGISLATURE CAN WORK TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM NOW. SO AS TO MAKE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS TOWARD RESOLVING THIS CRISIS IN THE FUTURE. WITHOUT A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY AND PLAN THE EFFORTS TO COMBAT THIS CRISIS WILL BE INCOMPLETE AT ULTIMATELY INEFFECTIVE. CURRENT GAPS WILL REMAIN. NEW CAPSULE FORM. AND THESE GAPS WILL BE EXPLOITED WITH POTENTIALLY CATASTROPHIC RESULTS. ONE THING IS CERTAIN NOW FAILING TO ACT WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A HEAVY HUMAN TOLL. I ASK THAT YOU I ASK YOU A WHAT OTHER PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE ARE CRITICALLY IN NEED OF RESOLUTION. AS THAT OF MISSING AND MURDERED INDIGENOUS PEOPLES. INCLUDING I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR AFFORDING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS HEARING AND I URGE YOU TO BUILD UPON TODAY'S DISCUSSIONS TO KEEP THE DISCUSSIONS GOING INTO IMPLEMENT SHORT TERM AND LONG TERM STRATEGIES AND POLICIES AS NECESSARY. TO ADDRESS THIS EPIDEMIC. THE GOOD NEWS IS WE DON'T NEED TO REINVENT THE WHEEL HERE WE'VE HEARD LOTS OF EXAMPLES OF WHAT TRIBES ARE DOING IT OTHER STATES ARE DOING. TO ADDRESS THIS EPIDEMIC VARIOUS INITIATIVES PROGRAMS FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES. AND WHILE THESE EFFORTS ARE WIDELY VARIED. THEY SHARE A COMMON. THEME EDUCATION COMPASSION COOPERATION. AND PARTNERSHIP. ASSEMBLY TRIBAL LEADERS WE QUITE LITERALLY WORKING TOGETHER HAVE THE POWER TO SAVE LIVES THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT POWERFUL- TESTIMONY THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OF THE CHAMBER REGINALD OUT OF MAKE THIS QUICK BECAUSE- ONE OF THE THINGS I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP WITH- IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT- IF YOU WOULD HAVE TRAVELS SOVEREIGNTY BUT PEACE OFFICERS AND POSSIBLY HAVEN'T PEACE OFFICER STATUS- I'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. AT GETTING PEACE OFFICER STATUS WORKERS CALL THE EXPOSITION POLICE BASE AROUND. THE COLISEUM IN EXPOSITION PARK I'VE ALSO GOTTEN POLICE OFFICER SATISH FOR UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS- AND SOMETIMES S. C. BELIEVE THEIR SOVEREIGNTY UNTO THEMSELVES BUT THEY'VE GOTTEN. FULL PLEASE STATUS SO IT CAN BE DONE I JUST NEED TO KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN THE STUMBLING BLOCK AND- ALL OF THAT COMES TO MY COMMITTEE PUBLIC SAFETY SO AS WE- AS WE MOVE FORWARD- I DON'T KNOW IF. IF I DO IT WILL DO IT MISTER RAMOS BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS A FIGHT OVER HERE WHO WANTS TO. DO THESE BILLS BUT- SWEPT IT TO EVER BRINGS IT. AND WHOEVER BRINGS IT- LET'S START EARLY ABOUT IT BUT THE THING I WANT TO DO MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE AS I WAS TELLING YOU WE'RE DOING THIS PIECEMEAL WITH DIFFERENT POLICE ENTITIES. IF WE CAN DO ONE GLOBAL TRAVELS STATEWIDE. AUTHORIZATION FOR POLICE OFFICERS THAT IS FOR EVERY TRIBAL- PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER- WOULD BE PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO DO IT OTHERWISE I DON'T COME IN FOR YOUR TRIBE AND ANOTHER ONE AND THEN ANOTHER ONE. IT IS SO FRUSTRATING. SOMETIMES LET'S. LET'S COME UP WITHOUT A PLAN AND THEN BUT MOST IMPORTANT. TO KEEP YOUR PUBLIC LAW TO RADIO RIPARIAN NEED TO HAVE A JUST A HEARING ON THAT BECAUSE I'VE HEARD. IT BE PROBLEMATIC ON SEVERAL. SEVERAL CASES. THANK YOU A MISTER CHAIRMAN THE% PUBLIC. SAFETY COMMITTEE FOR THE ASSEMBLY AND THANK YOU FOR THE OFFER TO HELP- REMEDY SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS ARE ARE COMING FORWARD AND HOPEFULLY- THE CHAIRS ARE TAKING DIALOGUE AND HAVING YOUR YOUR PEOPLE ALREADY CALLED HIS OFFICE TO SET UP A MEETING TO FURTHER THE DISCUSSION- IT IT'S NOT A FIGHTER WHO'S GONNA MOVE FORWARD AS WE MOVE FORWARD FOR THE FIRST PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- FOR THE ISSUES THAT ARE ARE DRASTICALLY AFFECTING ONE PERSON CAN'T DO IT ALL SO IT'S GOOD TO HAVE COLLEAGUES IN THE SUPPORT HERE. THAT YOU'RE HEARING- FROM THE DYESS- NOT SURE OF- CRITICISM AGUIAR-CURRY- I'M SORRY CAME IN LATE THIS BEEN A BUSY DAY BUT I'M REALLY HAPPY AS YOUR FOR THE POINT THAT I DID HEAR. WHAT I HEAR LET'S KEEP OUR DIALOGUE GOING GUARANTEED IT'S NOT TOO DIFFICULT TO DO THAT WE JUST HAVE TO SET THE TIME I REALLY LIKE AN IDEA OF A BLUE RIBBON COMMITTEE I'VE DONE THAT ON SOME PROJECTS AND SO MY COUNTIES AND THEY WORK REALLY WELL IT'S ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT HARD IN THE NATIONAL TO GET EVERYBODY TO SIT DOWN AT A TABLE AND HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS BUT THEY DO WORK IN THE SUCCESSFUL. WOULD WANT AN OUTCOME OF THAT FIGHT WITH WHAT KIND OF THINGS TO COME OUT OF THAT- I'M- THE WHAT WE'RE- WHY. I THINK YOU WERE JUST SAYING ABOUT THE KNOW HOW WE PUT THIS ALL. AND NUMBER ONE WHATEVER PUT TOGETHER HERE I WANNA MAKE SURE WE CAN IMPLEMENT. YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE PROBLEM HOW DO YOU FIX IT AND SO MANY TIMES WE HAVE LEGISLATION THIS BUILDING. AS ALL OF US KNOW THE DOESN'T GET IMPLEMENTED. SO AS WE SIT DOWN AND YOU SIT DOWN WITH ALL OF US WHATEVER LET'S DO REAL STRONG FRAMEWORK. AND EACH YEAR FOR NEED TO COME BACK AND BUILD ON IT BUILD ON IT BUILD ON IT THAT ONLY MAKES REALLY REALLY STRONG POLICY. AND I'M YOU KNOW I'M COMMITTED TO HELP OUT OF. ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON THIS ON THIS- IT TAKES SOME TIME AND I KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS REALLY FRUSTRATING. I LOVE LUCY PAUL. NEED TO HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY. YEAH WE WOULD LIKE TO LAS.

SURE BRINGS IT TO OUR PUBLIC SEARS. THANK YOU- SO MEMBER. AND IN THIS OF MISSING- INDIAN PERSONS FROM. IN RESERVATIONS TRAVEL COMMUNITIES ISN'T SOMETHING NEW IT'S BEEN HAPPENING I KNOW SINCE WE'VE BEEN GROWING UP WHAT'S WHAT'S NEW IS THAT THERE'S THE ADVOCACY HAS NOW- GARNERED ATTENTION THAT NOW IS BRINGING THESE ISSUES TO LIGHT- THERE HAS BEEN. A LOT- WITHIN INDIAN COUNTRY FOR YEARS GOING ON SO IT'S NOT JUST A NUMBER A NEW CRISIS IT'S BEEN A CRISIS AND THIS IS JUST ONE OF THE CRISIS HAS AFFECTED- INDIAN PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOSTER CARE- IS A BIG ONE ALSO IN THE KIDS GOING MISSING BUT NO ONE'S BEEN NOTIFIED. OF THOSE ISSUES- AND RESERVATIONS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S CLOSE TO THE BORDER- WE HEAR A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON WITH BORDER- AREAS BORDER CITIES AMPLIFY THAT WITH THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS I MEAN WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENTS- TWENTY TIMES HIGHER THAN OTHER AREAS ALL THESE ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUT SEE THE AVERAGE. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH ALL ETHNICITIES WE'VE HEARD SOME SHORT TERM SOLUTIONS AN ALERT SYSTEM KEPT HAVING A OCCURRING- THEME AND PUSH FOR THAT BUT WE ALSO HEARD THAT- THE- CLIPS AND SOMEONE USE THAT THE TERM TAPS AS FAR AS ANOTHER A REPORTING LAW ENFORCEMENT TYPE DEAL THERE'S ACCESS TO THOSE TYPES OF THINGS AND WILL FURTHER THE DISCUSSION. ON THAT BUT ALSO THE UNDERSTANDING OF PUBLIC LAW TO EIGHTY WITH THE JURISDICTIONS THAT- LOCAL COUNTY SHARE OF SENATE NOW IN SOME CASES CITIES THAT BORDER- FEDERAL INDIAN RESERVATIONS NEED TO HAVE A TRUE UNDERSTANDING OF THAT- MOVE YOU FORWARD AND YOU GOT TENSION OF THE CHAIR. OF PUBLIC SAFETY ON THE- POLICING A THOUGHT OUT FOR TRAVEL COMMUNITIES THAT WANTS TO BE ABLE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT IT BUT WE ALSO HERE THAT HAS TO BE FOR THE STATE RIGHT SO THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO SOME WORK TO THAT BUT THAT'S STUFF THAT THAT WE WANT TO. BRING FOR. THAT THE ADVOCACY IN THE PLATFORM- THAT WERE ABLE TO DO THROUGH THIS- I HEARING AND- CAUCUS THAT WE CHAIR IN THE SELECT COMMITTEE SO THAT WE BRING THESE ISSUES TO THE FOREFRONT. WE'VE ALSO HEARD ABOUT PREVENTION- PREVENTION AS FAR AS SOCIAL MEDIA WE HEAR THAT A LOT- WITHIN. OUR DIFFERENT BILLS AND DIFFERENT TOPICS THAT WE SEE AND SOMEHOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PREVENTING THE SOCIAL. MEDIA DOES IT GO OUT FOR- TRAFFICKING BOASTING SOMEHOW WHEN IT COMES TO THAT THE TRIBAL COMMUNITY SOMEHOW THE RESOURCES DON'T REACH THOSE COMMUNITIES TO ENSURE. THAT THE OPPORTUNITIES THERE ALSO TO BE AWARE OF THE SITUATIONS THAT ARE THERE SO I THINK JUST AS HAPPENED WITH THE BROADBAND. DEBTS THAT ONE SENSE INCLUDING TRIBAL COMMUNITIES MAYBE WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT BILLS THAT COME OUR WAY. THAT WOULD INCLUDE- TRAVEL COMMUNITIES FOR RESOURCES- MOVING FORWARD. THE BLUE RIBBON- COMMISSION IS A GREAT- A GREAT A SOLUTION- A NICE VIEW THAT AS SOMETHING LONG TERM RIGHT THAT WE COULD PUT TOGETHER. AND THAT CONTINUES TO BE ADHERED TO AND AN AMENDED ALONG THE WAY.
