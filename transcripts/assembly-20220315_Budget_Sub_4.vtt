LEGISLATIVE INTENT. CHALLENGE

00:46:19.843 --> 00:46:22.546
WE'VE SEEN IS THAT LAWS ARE SLOW

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:39.114
INFORMATION. SO WE DON'T HAVE A

01:13:39.181 --> 01:13:42.718
WAY TO REQUIRED PEOPLE TO REPORT

DIVERSITY EQUITY INCLUSION. BUT

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.102
HOW DO YOU DO THAT WHEN THERE

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:02.237
ARE LAWS THAT ACTUALLY DO NOT

01:14:02.304 --> 01:14:05.641
ALLOW FOR YOU TO DO THAT. WHAT'S

01:14:05.707 --> 01:14:09.311
THE WORKAROUND. LIKE I SAID WE

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:18.253
INSTANCE OF PEOPLE WHO DO REPORT

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:21.390

NEED STAFF TO DO THOSE THINGS

01:14:54.122 --> 01:14:57.025
AND IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK TO

01:14:57.092 --> 01:14:59.394
DISSECT THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION

01:14:59.461 --> 01:15:01.997

IS WE WANT TO DO WILL ACHIEVE

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:22.064
THOSE THINGS. OKAY SO HERE'S

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:23.065
HERE'S SOMETHING THAT I WOULD

01:18:23.131 --> 01:18:24.933
LIKE TO SEE BEFORE WE HAVE TO

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.301
MAKE A DECISION ON THIS

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:31.106
PARTICULAR PROPOSAL. I'D LIKE TO-KNOW HOW MANY APPLICANTS CALLIE

01:18:31.173 --> 01:18:34.309
CHAR CURRENTLY HAS HAD TO DATE

01:18:34.376 --> 01:18:36.144
WE CAN EVEN LOOK AT IT FOR THE

01:18:36.211 --> 01:18:38.180
PAST TWO YEARS. IN THE PAST WELL

01:18:38.246 --> 01:18:39.748
TWO YEARS THE MID PANDEMIC CAN

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:41.349
BE CHALLENGING. SO LET'S FIGURE

01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:43.852
THAT OUT. BUT OUT OF THE OUT OF

01:18:43.919 --> 01:18:46.421
THE APPLICANTS HOW MANY HAVE

01:18:46.488 --> 01:18:48.090
BEEN HIRED QUESTION ONE.

01:18:48.156 --> 01:18:50.292
FOLLOWED BY OF THE APPLICANTS

01:18:50.358 --> 01:18:52.194
HOW MANY SUBMITTED THE

01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:55.130
VOLUNTARY- INFORMATION TO

01:18:55.197 --> 01:18:56.598
ADDRESS ISSUES OF DIVERSITY

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:58.633
EQUITY AND INCLUSION. AND I

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.235
WOULD YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY IN THE

01:19:00.302 --> 01:19:01.703
IN THE POSITION OF DIVERSITY

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:05.240
ALSO INCLUDE GENDER. AND SO I AM

01:19:05.307 --> 01:19:06.575
I ASSUME I AND- CORRECT ME IF

01:19:06.641 --> 01:19:07.976
I'M WRONG THAT THESE ARE THINGS

01:19:08.043 --> 01:19:09.678
THAT YOU'RE CURRENTLY ASKING IN

01:19:09.744 --> 01:19:12.347
THE APPLICATION. FOR YOU TO BE

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:17.652
ABLE TO COLLECT DATA. MADAM

01:19:17.719 --> 01:19:20.722
CHAIR IF I COULD JUMP IN PER

01:19:20.789 --> 01:19:22.324
SECOND I THINK THERE'S SOME

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:24.726
CONFUSION THAT THE DATA THAT'S

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:27.195
COLLECTED- IS FROM A FORM THAT

01:19:27.262 --> 01:19:28.930
NEW HIRES FILL OUT NOT

01:19:28.997 --> 01:19:31.333
APPLICANTS IN ITS DATA THAT ARE

01:19:31.399 --> 01:19:34.169
COLLECTED BASED ON FEDERAL E. O.

01:19:34.236 --> 01:19:37.105
REQUIREMENTS- AND SO THE

01:19:37.172 --> 01:19:39.541
QUESTIONS ON THE FORM ARE BASED

01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.743
ON GENDER AND IT'S ONLY MALE OR

01:19:41.810 --> 01:19:44.513
FEMALE AND THEN THERE ARE MONEY

01:19:44.579 --> 01:19:48.216
RACE RACE AND ETHNIC- CATEGORIES

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:49.885
THE EMPLOYEES MAY CHOOSE FROM.

01:19:49.951 --> 01:19:51.987
AMONG THE BECAUSE THE FEDERAL

01:19:52.053 --> 01:19:53.588
LAW REQUIRES THAT THE STATE

01:19:53.655 --> 01:19:55.790
REPORT THIS INFORMATION TO THE

01:19:55.857 --> 01:19:58.326
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- WHAT THE

01:19:58.393 --> 01:19:59.427
WHAT IT STRUCTURES THAT

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:01.029
EMPLOYEES ARE ASKED TO PROVIDE

01:20:01.096 --> 01:20:03.198
THE INFORMATION- AND IT WILL

01:20:03.265 --> 01:20:05.400
EASE CHOOSE TO NOT PROVIDE THE

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:06.168
INFORMATION WHICH IS OUR

01:20:06.234 --> 01:20:09.271
UNDERSTANDING THAT ABOUT 14% OF

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:10.872
EMPLOYEES DO NOT PROVIDE THE

01:20:10.939 --> 01:20:14.910
INFORMATION- THEN THE MANAGEMENT

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:17.145
WILL IDENTIFY VISUALLY WHAT THE

01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:19.681
EMPLOYEE IS GENDER AND RACE OR

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:22.017
ETHNICITY IS FOR PURPOSES OF

01:20:22.083 --> 01:20:22.551
REPORTING TO THE FEDERAL

01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:24.519
GOVERNMENT. SO I THINK JUST

01:20:24.586 --> 01:20:26.588
ACCEPTABLE TO CONFUSION THIS

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:27.989
DATA ARE NOT COLLECTED FOR

01:20:28.056 --> 01:20:33.261
APPLICANTS COLLECTED. FROM HIRED

01:20:33.328 --> 01:20:35.530
EMPLOYEES. OKAY SO I SOME FOR

01:20:35.597 --> 01:20:36.965
UPS THAT CAN YOU. CAN YOU GO

01:20:37.032 --> 01:20:39.568
BACK AND TELL ME AGAIN YOU SAID

01:20:39.634 --> 01:20:42.237
THAT THE EMPLOYER VISUALLY THEN

01:20:42.304 --> 01:20:43.905
MAKES ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT AN

01:20:43.972 --> 01:20:47.375
INDIVIDUAL'S. GENDER RACE

01:20:47.442 --> 01:20:52.047
ETHNICITY. CORRECT BECAUSE THE

01:20:52.113 --> 01:20:53.915
FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THAT REPORT

01:20:53.982 --> 01:20:56.251
THE INFORMATION- THE WAY THAT

01:20:56.318 --> 01:20:58.653
IT'S A LITTLE BIT CLOSER TO

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.288
MICROPHONE PLEASE. I'M SURE I

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:02.257
CAN- BASICALLY THE WAY THAT IT

01:21:02.324 --> 01:21:03.858
WORKS IS BECAUSE THE FEDERAL

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:05.694
GOVERNMENT REQUIRES THAT WE

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:08.129
REPORT THIS INFORMATION- THE WAY

01:21:08.196 --> 01:21:09.531
CURRENTLY WORKS AS AN EMPLOYER

01:21:09.598 --> 01:21:10.899
ASKED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION BUT

01:21:10.966 --> 01:21:12.601
IF THEY DON'T. THE FORMER

01:21:12.667 --> 01:21:14.469
EXPLICITLY SAYS ON THE FORM THAT

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:16.404
IF AN EMPLOYEE CHOOSES TO NOT

01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:18.273
PROVIDING INFORMATION THAT

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:19.441
MANAGEMENT WILL VISUALLY

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:21.409
IDENTIFY THEM IN OTHER WORDS

01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:22.811
MANAGEMENT WILL FILL OUT THE

01:21:22.877 --> 01:21:25.347
FORM FOR THE EMPLOYEE. IN THAT

01:21:25.413 --> 01:21:26.881
CASE THERE IS NO STATEWIDE

01:21:26.948 --> 01:21:28.550
GUIDANCE AS FAR AS HOW

01:21:28.617 --> 01:21:31.319
MANAGEMENT SHOULD DO THAT. AND

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:33.054
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK

01:21:33.121 --> 01:21:34.522
THERE COULD BE IMPROVEMENT FOR

01:21:34.589 --> 01:21:36.491
GOING FORWARD UNDER THIS D. I.

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:40.428
PROPOSAL FOR THE ABOUT THE STATE

01:21:40.495 --> 01:21:43.465
. SO IT'S BASICALLY A GUESSING

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:48.403
GAME BY MANAGEMENT. HOW DO YOU

01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:49.971
KNOW THAT HOW DO YOU IDENTIFY

01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:51.506
SOMEONE SIMPLICITY WITHOUT

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:58.146
ACTUALLY ASKING THEM. YOU AGAIN

01:21:58.213 --> 01:21:59.514
THAT THIS IS A FEDERAL

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:03.351
REQUIREMENT AND SO WE DO HAVE TO

01:22:03.418 --> 01:22:05.453
MEET THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:08.056
AND IT IS CURRENTLY A VISUAL

01:22:08.123 --> 01:22:09.891
IDENTIFICATION I BELIEVE THAT

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:12.994
SOME. IT DEPARTMENTS WILL ASK

01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:16.598

CHECKED- GIVE THEM AN

01:22:18.233 --> 01:22:20.702
OPPORTUNITY TO AGAIN IDENTIFY

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:23.705
AND IF NOT THEY ARE REQUIRED TO

01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:25.640

CONSIDERATION BUT ALSO WAS THE

01:51:30.116 --> 01:51:32.152
FIRST YEAR OF THE PANDEMIC. BUT

01:51:32.218 --> 01:51:34.254
BECAUSE OF THE WORLD'S INACTION

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:36.689
IN THAT WAR. RUSSIA SAW AN

01:51:36.756 --> 01:51:39.592
OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE SAME THING

01:51:39.659 --> 01:51:43.029
NOW. AND IT'S TAKING A LONG TIME

01:51:43.096 --> 01:51:44.898
FOR IT TO DO WHAT IT'S DOING

01:51:44.964 --> 01:51:45.398
BECAUSE THERE'S GREATER

01:51:45.465 --> 01:51:48.435
AWARENESS AND WORK AGAINST THAT.

01:51:48.501 --> 01:51:51.838
AND BUT BUT UNFORTUNATELY MOST

01:51:51.905 --> 01:51:53.506
OF THE WORLD IS STILL STANDING

01:51:53.573 --> 01:51:55.775
IDLY BY WATCHING IT HAPPEN. AND

01:51:55.842 --> 01:51:58.711
SECOND AS WE'VE PROGRESSED IN

01:51:58.778 --> 01:52:01.214
CURRENT DAY WARFARE WE KNOW

01:52:01.281 --> 01:52:04.350
THAT. ECONOMICS AND FINANCES ARE

01:52:04.417 --> 01:52:07.720
THE BEST WAY OF CURTAILING HARM

01:52:07.787 --> 01:52:09.856
TO HUMAN LIFE SO WHEN YOU TAKE

01:52:09.923 --> 01:52:12.292
STEPS TO DAMAGE SOMEONE

01:52:12.358 --> 01:52:15.195
ECONOMICALLY YOU WILL. YOU WILL

01:52:15.261 --> 01:52:19.365
GET TO A PLACE WHERE- YOU THE

01:52:19.432 --> 01:52:22.368
HUMAN SUFFERING. STOPS THE

01:52:22.435 --> 01:52:25.371
BLEEDING STOPS AND SO I DO THINK

01:52:25.438 --> 01:52:29.476
THAT- A DIVESTMENT WORKS- IT

01:52:29.542 --> 01:52:30.877
CAN'T BE SOMETHING THAT'S DONE

01:52:30.944 --> 01:52:33.913
ON EVERY ISSUE BUT IT'S A GREAT

01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:36.583
FORM OF EXERCISE. TO ACTUALLY

01:52:36.649 --> 01:52:40.587
HELP STOP HARM. RAIDER HARM FROM

01:52:40.653 --> 01:52:42.989
HAPPENING AND IF THE DIVEST

01:52:43.056 --> 01:52:44.524
MONTHS WE'VE PASSED THE WE'VE

01:52:44.591 --> 01:52:46.726
HELPED PASS IN THE PAST. OVER

01:52:46.793 --> 01:52:48.595
THIRTY YEARS AGO WE PASSED THE

01:52:48.661 --> 01:52:50.396
DEBT FIRST ADVANCEMENT WITH THE

01:52:50.463 --> 01:52:52.398
SOUTH AFRICA AND IT HAD

01:52:52.465 --> 01:52:54.801
REMARKABLE IMPACTS. FOR THAT

01:52:54.868 --> 01:52:58.004
COUNTRY AND FOR. MANY PARTS OF

01:52:58.071 --> 01:53:01.975
AFRICA AS WELL- HAD IF WE ARE

01:53:02.041 --> 01:53:04.477
STRATEGIC. AND PRECISION

01:53:04.544 --> 01:53:07.013
ORIENTED AND THE STEPS WE TAKE

01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:09.315
WE ACTUALLY CAN HAVE THE

01:53:09.382 --> 01:53:11.518
VESTMENT BE A GREAT TOOL TO

01:53:11.584 --> 01:53:14.320
ADDRESS. A VERY DIFFICULT

01:53:14.387 --> 01:53:16.589
CIRCUMSTANCES AND OTHER PLACES

01:53:16.656 --> 01:53:18.324
BECAUSE WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST

01:53:18.391 --> 01:53:20.193
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND WE HAVE

01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:21.895
THE THIRTEENTH LARGEST BUDGET IN

01:53:21.961 --> 01:53:23.229
THE WORLD AT THIS POINT.

01:53:23.296 --> 01:53:27.167
IRONICALLY RUSSIA'S FOURTEENTH

01:53:27.233 --> 01:53:29.636
AND SO WHEN WE IMPOSE OUR WILL

01:53:29.702 --> 01:53:32.071
FINANCIALLY ON SOMEBODY ELSE IT

01:53:32.138 --> 01:53:34.440
ACTUALLY IS REVERBERATED OVER

01:53:34.507 --> 01:53:36.042
THE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND IT

01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:38.511
HAS AN IMPACT SO I JUST WANTED

01:53:38.578 --> 01:53:40.213
TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS A

01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:42.582
COUNTER ARE ARE A STATEMENT MADE

01:53:42.649 --> 01:53:46.152
TO THAT OF THE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:53:46.219 --> 01:53:48.888
WE KNOW WHAT OUR MIGHT IS AND

01:53:48.955 --> 01:53:51.958
WHAT WE CAN DO AS CALIFORNIA OF-

01:53:52.025 --> 01:53:54.027
IT EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT WE WERE

01:53:54.093 --> 01:53:56.930
STATE AND WE ARE ACTIONS.

01:53:56.996 --> 01:53:58.531
SHOULDN'T BE ON THE

01:53:58.598 --> 01:54:00.333
INTERNATIONAL FRONT BUT GIVEN

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.902
THE POPULATIONS THAT WE'VE

01:54:02.969 --> 01:54:05.205
BENEFITED FROM. AS CONSTITUENTS

01:54:05.271 --> 01:54:06.606
AND RESIDENTS OF OUR STATE AND

01:54:06.673 --> 01:54:08.608
GIVEN OUR ECONOMIC MIGHT. I

01:54:08.675 --> 01:54:10.210
THINK THAT THOSE ARE TWO NORTON

01:54:10.276 --> 01:54:15.682
WORTHY- FACTORS THAT ALLOW US TO

01:54:15.748 --> 01:54:17.784
PLAY A ROLE IN THIS SO. MANAGER

01:54:17.850 --> 01:54:19.552
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO

01:54:19.619 --> 01:54:20.853
AT LEAST THE SAVE THOSE COUPLE

01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:22.922
WORDS SO I THINK I GROUP MY

01:54:22.989 --> 01:54:24.791
COLLEAGUE ON THAT. OCCASION WHEN

01:54:24.857 --> 01:54:26.192
THE WHEN THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD

01:54:26.259 --> 01:54:28.127
GETS INVOLVED THAT'S GOOD IT'S A

01:54:28.194 --> 01:54:29.195
GOOD THING BUT WHAT I'M SAYING

01:54:29.262 --> 01:54:30.964
IS ON THESE PASSED THE VESTMENTS

01:54:31.030 --> 01:54:33.032
IT HASN'T BEEN THE LIGHT. OF THE

01:54:33.099 --> 01:54:34.400
WORLD A LOT IT IS JUST

01:54:34.467 --> 01:54:35.268
CALIFORNIA EARLY PEOPLE DOING

01:54:35.335 --> 01:54:36.970
THAT AND- WE SAID THE

01:54:37.036 --> 01:54:40.406
PERSEVERING OF THE IT WAS THE-

01:54:40.473 --> 01:54:41.841
JOINT COMMITTEE. BETWEEN

01:54:41.908 --> 01:54:44.277
ASSEMBLY PERSON SENATE PERS. AND

01:54:44.344 --> 01:54:46.112
THE SIX INVESTMENTS HAVE HAD

01:54:46.179 --> 01:54:47.847
HAVE NOT WORKED SOUTH AFRICA'S

01:54:47.914 --> 01:54:49.949
DIFFERENT THE WORLD WAS ON THAT.

01:54:50.016 --> 01:54:51.050
SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS I AGREE

01:54:51.117 --> 01:54:53.653
WITH YOU. I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT

01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:54.821
BUT- IT CAN'T BE CALIFORNIA

01:54:54.887 --> 01:54:56.256
ALONE AND RUSHED TO THE GOOD

01:54:56.322 --> 01:54:58.324
EXAMPLE YOU HAVE THE ENTIRE

01:54:58.391 --> 01:54:59.325
WORLD. SO CALIFORNIA MAY DO IT

01:54:59.392 --> 01:55:01.027
IN FIFTH LARGELY CONNIE BUT THAT

01:55:01.094 --> 01:55:02.996
SAME TIME. THERE'S SOME ISSUES

01:55:03.062 --> 01:55:04.897
WITH THAT. YOU KNOW IT WITH

01:55:04.964 --> 01:55:07.066
CALIFORNIA DOING IT BY ITSELF

01:55:07.133 --> 01:55:09.102
SO. TO ME IT'S MORE EFFECTIVE

01:55:09.168 --> 01:55:11.604
EVERYBODY COMES IN. AND WE HAVE

01:55:11.671 --> 01:55:12.605
FOUR FIVE DIVEST BILLS EVERY

01:55:12.672 --> 01:55:13.806
YEAR IN PERSON AND I'VE BEEN

01:55:13.873 --> 01:55:15.041

01:55:15.108 --> 01:55:18.745
THIS. AND LIKE FOR OVER A

01:55:18.811 --> 01:55:20.146
VARIETY OF REASONS SO. YOU KNOW

01:55:20.213 --> 01:55:21.547
A FEW THINGS HAVE CHANGED

01:55:21.614 --> 01:55:23.916
ABSOLUTELY I AGREE- IT'S

01:55:23.983 --> 01:55:25.051
ATROCIOUS WITHIN THESE FOLKS

01:55:25.118 --> 01:55:27.553
HAVE DONE. BUT ALSO THESE BIG

01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:30.957
PENSION SYSTEMS. CAN ALSO MOVE

01:55:31.024 --> 01:55:32.659
IT HAVE AN EFFECT ON THEIR OWN.

01:55:32.725 --> 01:55:34.494
IN GETTING US THERE VERSUS THE

01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:36.562
LEGISLATURE EVERY YEAR PUTTING A

01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:38.498
NEW BILL FORD WEIGHING IN ON IT.

01:55:38.564 --> 01:55:40.199
THE SYSTEMS ARE FULLY FUNDED

01:55:40.266 --> 01:55:41.467
YOU'VE GOT A PLACE AT WORK FOR

01:55:41.534 --> 01:55:43.369
YOURSELF THAT WORK FOR ME THAT

01:55:43.436 --> 01:55:44.037
WORKING IS BEING REQUESTED A

01:55:44.103 --> 01:55:46.406
CALIFORNIA. IS NOT FOR IT I'VE

01:55:46.472 --> 01:55:47.907
GOT THE MOST EMPLOYEES IN

01:55:47.974 --> 01:55:48.775
SACRAMENTO. GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES

01:55:48.841 --> 01:55:50.677
STATE CITY AND COUNTY I'VE GOT

01:55:50.743 --> 01:55:51.911
THE MOST RETIREES AND SECOND A

01:55:51.978 --> 01:55:53.980
COUNTY FOR STATE CITY AND COUNTY

01:55:54.047 --> 01:55:56.449
AND IT IS A- IT IS AN ISSUE WITH

01:55:56.516 --> 01:55:58.718
IT. WE KEEP SAYING FOSSIL FUELS.

01:55:58.785 --> 01:55:59.686
AND IS THIS ONE THING AFTER

01:55:59.752 --> 01:56:01.921
ANOTHER. IN THOSE PISTON SYSTEMS

01:56:01.988 --> 01:56:04.023
NEED TO BE HOLE. FOR THOSE

01:56:04.090 --> 01:56:05.458

AND RETIREES AND IT'S JUST LIKE

01:56:08.494 --> 01:56:09.262
SOME THE THINGS WE DIVESTED

01:56:09.329 --> 01:56:11.230
FROM. JUST BECAUSE WE DIVEST

01:56:11.297 --> 01:56:12.965
FROM. DOESN'T MEAN THE REST THE

01:56:13.032 --> 01:56:15.301
WORLD DIVEST FROM IT AND THE

01:56:15.368 --> 01:56:16.336
FOLKS FROM CALPERS AND CAL

01:56:16.402 --> 01:56:18.338

01:56:18.404 --> 01:56:19.906
EXAMPLE IN THAT HEARING LAST

DETAILS TO GET THERE. BECAUSE IT

01:56:42.729 --> 01:56:44.530
IS NOT RIGHT BUT LIKE I SAID.

01:56:44.597 --> 01:56:46.499
