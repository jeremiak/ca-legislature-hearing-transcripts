ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:26.584
TO THE STATE. IMPORTANTLY WE

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:28.752
CREATED THESE. ESTIMATES BEFORE

00:41:28.819 --> 00:41:31.188
THE BILL WAS AND PRINT- AND SO

00:41:31.255 --> 00:41:32.556
THOSE THESE ESTIMATES MAY NOT

00:41:32.623 --> 00:41:36.660
ALIGN PERFECTLY. WITH THE

00:41:36.727 --> 00:41:37.261
PARAMETERS OF THE BILL. ALSO

00:41:37.328 --> 00:41:38.362
NOTE THAT ARE ESTIMATES ARE

00:41:38.429 --> 00:41:40.431
CREDIT ON A NUMBER OF

00:41:40.497 --> 00:41:41.065
ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING HOW MANY

00:41:41.131 --> 00:41:42.800
EMPLOYERS- PROVIDED THE SICK

00:41:42.867 --> 00:41:44.401
LEAVE PRIOR TO THE ENACTMENT OF

00:41:44.468 --> 00:41:45.703
THE BILL IN THERE FOR WOULD

00:41:45.769 --> 00:41:48.105
CLAIM. THE CREDIT DURING THE

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:51.609
PEAK OF THE SEARCH. I IN JANUARY

00:41:51.675 --> 00:41:54.211
AND FEBRUARY JUST I JANUARY-

00:41:54.278 --> 00:41:56.780
AND ALSO DEPENDENT ON. IF YOU

00:41:56.847 --> 00:41:59.283
READ HISTORY AT PRECEDING THE

00:41:59.350 --> 00:42:01.218
REST OF THE YEAR SO IT SO IT IS

00:42:01.285 --> 00:42:02.419
QUITE VARIABLE BUT SAID TO SUM

00:42:02.486 --> 00:42:04.388
UP WE DID WE DID RUN LAST NIGHT

00:42:04.455 --> 00:42:06.190
AND- CAME UP WITH BETWEEN FIVE

00:42:06.257 --> 00:42:08.125
HUNDRED MILLION MONTHLY FOR

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:10.794
BILLIONS. SO GOING BACK TO THE

00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:12.596
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IS I JUST

00:42:12.663 --> 00:42:13.898
WANT TO MAKE SURE I GET THIS

00:42:13.964 --> 00:42:15.366
CORRECTLY RIGHT LEG WE

00:42:15.432 --> 00:42:18.068
UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING THE

00:42:18.135 --> 00:42:19.536
- LET'S STIPULATE THAT THE

00:42:19.603 --> 00:42:21.272
RANGERS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO

00:42:21.338 --> 00:42:23.908
ONE POINT FOUR BILLION- THAT

00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:25.809
COSTS WOULD BE INCURRED BY.

00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:27.344
EMPLOYERS IN CALIFORNIA WITH NO

00:42:27.411 --> 00:42:33.083
OFFSET. HAVING NOT SEEN THE L.

00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:35.619
A. ANALYSIS I'M I AM NOT SURE I

00:42:35.686 --> 00:42:37.521
CAN RESPOND TO THAT I THINK THAT

00:42:37.588 --> 00:42:39.023
THERE ARE LOTS OF VARIABLES TO

00:42:39.089 --> 00:42:42.092
BE CONSIDERED. SHE STATED- AND

00:42:42.159 --> 00:42:45.062
SO THE POTENTIAL CHANGE COULD BE

00:42:45.129 --> 00:42:47.765
QUITE HIGH. WELL OKAY LOOK LET'S

00:42:47.831 --> 00:42:49.667
JUST LET'S JUST MAKE THE TAKE A

00:42:49.733 --> 00:42:51.435
STEP BACK AND SAY WITHOUT THERE

00:42:51.502 --> 00:42:53.304
IS NO FEDERAL TAX CREDIT YOU

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:56.140
STIPULATED THAT. SO THE COST OF

00:42:56.206 --> 00:42:59.576
THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE BORNE BY.

00:42:59.643 --> 00:43:01.979
BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA WITH NO

00:43:02.046 --> 00:43:07.451
OFFSET WHAT. SO THE BUSINESS'S

00:43:07.518 --> 00:43:09.753
BLADE BEAR THAT I WOULD JUST ADD

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.888
THAT THERE ARE THERE IS AN

00:43:10.955 --> 00:43:13.290
EXCEPTION INCLUDED IT WAS ALL

00:43:13.357 --> 00:43:15.993
PART IN PLAYERS WITH UNDER-

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.628
TWENTY FIVE EMPLOYEES AND I

00:43:17.695 --> 00:43:19.863
WOULD ALSO POINT TO MANY.

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:21.665
SUPPORTS THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED

00:43:21.732 --> 00:43:23.467
AT THE STATE AND THE FEDERAL

00:43:23.534 --> 00:43:25.803
LEVEL TO BUSINESS. INCLUDED IT'S

00:43:25.869 --> 00:43:27.504
UP SOME OF THOSE SOME OF THOSE

00:43:27.571 --> 00:43:28.639
ARE ACTUALLY INCLUDED IN THE

00:43:28.706 --> 00:43:29.907
EARLY ACTION AS WELL AS THE

00:43:29.974 --> 00:43:31.842
GOVERNOR HAS STATED THAT WE WILL

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:33.177
CONTINUE. TO LOOK FOR OTHER WAYS

00:43:33.243 --> 00:43:35.012
IN WHICH SUPPORTS BUSINESSES

00:43:35.079 --> 00:43:36.880
SMALL BUSINESSES IN PARTICULAR

00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:39.283
THAT HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED BY

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:41.919
COULD BE NINETEEN. SHE WELL I

00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:44.421
MEAN IF THE L. L. I KNOW WE'RE

00:43:44.488 --> 00:43:45.522
JUST DISPUTING THAT THE NUMBERS

00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:48.625
BUT THE ALEJO'S ANALYSIS WAS ON

00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:49.760
WITH THE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS OF

00:43:49.827 --> 00:43:51.562
THE EXEMPTION YOU WHAT WHERE YOU

00:43:51.628 --> 00:43:55.699
GUYS ARE EXTENDING- THE PREVIOUS

00:43:55.766 --> 00:43:57.468
IMAGE BASE IT IS IT IS THE

00:43:57.534 --> 00:43:58.836
EXTENSION OF THE PREVIOUS- BILL

00:43:58.902 --> 00:44:00.537
THAT WAS DONE LEGISLATURE. SO

00:44:00.604 --> 00:44:02.840
THAT EXEMPTION ORDER EXISTS SO

00:44:02.906 --> 00:44:04.742
WHATEVER CAUGHT SO WHATEVER COST

00:44:04.808 --> 00:44:07.077
WAS INCURRED. IN THE PREVIOUS

00:44:07.144 --> 00:44:09.546
BILL WOULD BE INCURRED AGAIN BUT

00:44:09.613 --> 00:44:13.117
WOULD NOW WOULD KNOW OFFSET-

00:44:13.183 --> 00:44:14.351
THAT IS CORRECT AND AGAIN I

00:44:14.418 --> 00:44:16.687
WOULD POINT TO SOME OF THE OTHER

00:44:16.754 --> 00:44:18.155
SUPPORTS ARE OUTSIDE. I'M THAT

00:44:18.222 --> 00:44:20.290
WE ARE PROVIDING TO SMALL

00:44:20.357 --> 00:44:21.291
BUSINESSES BUT YES THAT IS

00:44:21.358 --> 00:44:22.893
CORRECT OKAY. I WAS ONE MAKE

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:25.362
SURE THAT THE THAT THE FUTURE OR

00:44:25.429 --> 00:44:26.764
THE OTHER OR TAX RELIEF IS

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.766
APPLES TO ORANGES RIGHT IT'S NOT

00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:31.535
IT'S NOT RELATED TO- THE OFFSET

00:44:31.602 --> 00:44:35.572
OF THE COSTS. BUT JUMPING TO-

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:37.574
BUT BEFORE TO TALK ON THIS TOPIC

00:44:37.641 --> 00:44:41.412
I THINK- WHEN THE SPEAKER THE

00:44:41.478 --> 00:44:42.212
PRO TEM THE GOVERNOR SHOULD

00:44:42.279 --> 00:44:44.782
STATEMENT- YOU KNOW WE AGREE

00:44:44.848 --> 00:44:47.084
WITH YOUR- YOUR OINT AND WE

00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:49.420
THINK THAT. AS PART OF OUR JUNE

00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:49.953
BUDGET DISCUSSIONS THAT WE

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.022
SHOULD REALLY LOOK AT. SOME

00:44:52.089 --> 00:44:54.992
POTENTIAL GRANTS OR TAX RELIEF I

00:44:55.059 --> 00:44:56.460
IN PARTICULAR FOR SMALL

00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:57.194
BUSINESSES BECAUSE WE ARE

00:44:57.261 --> 00:44:59.797
CONCERNED. ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

00:44:59.863 --> 00:45:01.532
IMPACT ON THOSE BUSINESSES SO I

00:45:01.598 --> 00:45:03.467
THINK THAT- WHILE THAT'S NOT IN

00:45:03.534 --> 00:45:05.436
THIS PACKAGE I THINK THE

00:45:05.502 --> 00:45:07.271
ASSEMBLY DEFINITELY. I WANT TO

00:45:07.337 --> 00:45:08.906
CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION IN THE

00:45:08.972 --> 00:45:10.607
JUNE DISCUSSIONS- ESPECIALLY IN

00:45:10.674 --> 00:45:13.310
REGARDS TO HAVING A VERY.

00:45:13.377 --> 00:45:14.278
SPECIFIC FOCUS ON SMALL

00:45:14.344 --> 00:45:16.046
BUSINESSES AND I APPRECIATE THE

00:45:16.113 --> 00:45:17.848
COMMISSION THIS YEAR I THINK- HE

00:45:17.915 --> 00:45:19.683
ACKNOWLEDGES AS WELL AS I THAT

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:20.918
WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM THE

00:45:20.984 --> 00:45:22.186
SMALL BUSINESSES WHO ARE

00:45:22.252 --> 00:45:23.587
PERSEVERING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC

00:45:23.654 --> 00:45:24.655
IS THAT. WE'RE PLACING THE

00:45:24.721 --> 00:45:26.190
SECTOR THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS

00:45:26.256 --> 00:45:28.358
PLACING MORE BURDENS ON THEM AND

00:45:28.425 --> 00:45:31.228
THIS IS- A SIGNIFICANT COST

00:45:31.295 --> 00:45:33.564
BURDEN THAT IT HAS NO OFFSET AND

00:45:33.630 --> 00:45:34.598
I THINK THAT'S WHAT I'M TYING

00:45:34.665 --> 00:45:37.968
TO. TO FLUSH OUT- IN MY

00:45:38.035 --> 00:45:39.603
QUESTIONING SO I BUT I CERTAINLY

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:44.708
APPRECIATE THAT- SEARCHER.

00:45:44.775 --> 00:45:47.044
JUMPING TO- A ADS. SEVEN AND I'M

AB EIGHTY FOUR AND OF THE- I WAS

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:50.447

00:45:50.514 --> 00:45:56.820
RELIEF- THE PANDEMIC RELIEF- TO

00:45:56.887 --> 00:45:58.655
THE FORMER FINANCE I MY

00:45:58.722 --> 00:45:59.790
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE

00:45:59.857 --> 00:46:01.458
ISN'T A FULL CONFORMITY WHEN IT

00:46:01.525 --> 00:46:03.794
COMES TO- THE SHATTERED VENUES

00:46:03.861 --> 00:46:07.397
GRANT PROGRAM. AS WELL AS- OTHER

00:46:07.464 --> 00:46:09.933
PROGRAMS WITH- WITHIN THE PPP

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.403
PROGRAM- SPECIFICALLY THE

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:16.807
PAYCHECK PROTECTION. LOOK FOR

00:46:16.874 --> 00:46:19.476
PROGRAM LOANS AFTER MARCH THIRTY

00:46:19.543 --> 00:46:21.612

YOU GIVE ME AN EXPLANATION OF

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:28.585
WHY THERE ISN'T- FULL CONFORMITY

WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE PROGRAMS

00:46:30.687 --> 00:46:33.557
. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M- SURE JUST

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:35.592
A NOTE THAT THAT- THAT GAP HAS

00:46:35.659 --> 00:46:38.562
COME TO OUR ATTENTION RECENTLY

00:46:38.629 --> 00:46:39.229
AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

00:46:39.296 --> 00:46:41.498
HAVE BEEN. DISCUSSING IT IS NOT

00:46:41.565 --> 00:46:43.534
INCLUDED IN THIS EARLY ACTION

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.803
BUT- WE ARE AWARE OF THAT ISSUE

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:49.072
. OKAY SO THAT THERE IS A HOPE

00:46:49.139 --> 00:46:51.208
OF ACTION IN THE FUTURE OF

00:46:51.275 --> 00:46:52.176
ADDRESSING THAT GAP SO THAT

00:46:52.242 --> 00:46:55.479
THERE IS- FOR CONFORMITY MY

00:46:55.546 --> 00:46:58.048
CONCERN IS THAT- WE'RE TRYING TO

00:46:58.115 --> 00:47:00.350

ALLOCATED NOW THEY'RE BEING USED

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:33.570
AND WHETHER THEY'RE BEING USED

00:49:33.637 --> 00:49:35.572
EFFECTIVELY. AND WE'RE NOT USING

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:36.807
THE OTHER PROCESSES THAT WERE

00:49:36.873 --> 00:49:38.909
DONE- DURING THE PANDEMIC SO I'M

00:49:38.975 --> 00:49:41.712
JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I

00:49:41.778 --> 00:49:42.946

ABOUT WHY IN A TIME OF CRISIS

00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:23.453
THE GOVERNOR WHILE CRITIQUING

00:55:29.726 --> 00:55:32.629
THAT- THERE AND THAT. YOU COULD

00:55:32.696 --> 00:55:34.631

QUESTION ON ON THIS BILL IS THE

00:55:45.341 --> 00:55:46.743
CREATION OF THIS CALIFORNIA

00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:49.045
EMERGENCY RELIEF FUND. IS THERE

00:55:49.112 --> 00:55:50.180
A REASON WHY WE'RE CREATING A

00:55:50.246 --> 00:55:51.915
NEW PHONE AND INSTEAD OF JUST

00:55:51.981 --> 00:55:54.818
USING THE EXISTING FUNDS TO

00:55:54.884 --> 00:55:58.088
PROVIDE EMERGENCY RELIEF WHY WHY

00:55:58.154 --> 00:56:00.290
CREATE THIS NEW RELIEF FUND.

00:56:00.356 --> 00:56:02.892
SURE THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE

00:56:02.959 --> 00:56:04.461
RELIEF FUND THAT WAS CREATED IN

00:56:04.527 --> 00:56:05.462

PROVISIONS AROUND THAT SO. IT

00:56:18.908 --> 00:56:20.376

USE THAT SAME EMERGENCY FUND BUT

00:56:22.712 --> 00:56:24.581
SIMILAR TO THAT INSTANCE WE'RE

00:56:24.647 --> 00:56:25.949
BEING CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT

00:56:26.015 --> 00:56:28.284
LAW AND THAT ACTIVITY FROM LAST

00:56:28.351 --> 00:56:29.953

00:56:47.871 --> 00:56:50.006
GENERAL FUND. SURE AND THIS IS

00:56:50.073 --> 00:56:51.608

THAT- WE TOOK LAST YEAR THAT

00:56:53.576 --> 00:56:55.078

00:56:55.145 --> 00:56:56.780
LEGISLATURE UP STARTLED THE

00:56:56.846 --> 00:56:58.414
LEGISLATURE AN ADMINISTRATION

00:56:58.481 --> 00:56:59.682
PROPOSED LAST YEAR SO I JUST

00:56:59.749 --> 00:57:01.317
WANT TO POINT THAT OUT AND WE

00:57:01.384 --> 00:57:02.619
HAVE THE ADDED BENEFIT THAT THIS

00:57:02.685 --> 00:57:06.489
COULD BE- IT SOUNDS LITTLE.

00:57:06.556 --> 00:57:08.892
EXCLUDABLE AS WELL. SO YOU'RE

00:57:08.958 --> 00:57:12.428
TRYING TO MOVE THESE FUNDS FROM.

00:57:12.495 --> 00:57:15.465
THE CELL YEAH LIMIT- THAT'S A

00:57:15.532 --> 00:57:19.569
POSSIBILITY. THAT COULD BENEFIT-

00:57:19.636 --> 00:57:21.271
THE STATE IF THESE FUNDS ARE

00:57:21.337 --> 00:57:23.339
PROVIDED THROUGH AN EMERGENCY

00:57:23.406 --> 00:57:26.409
ACCOUNT. SO WHY WOULD YOU WANT

00:57:26.476 --> 00:57:31.014
IT EXCLUDED- AT. IT IS IT

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:34.083
ACTUALLY IS EXCLUDED FROM THAT-

00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:36.519
THE STATE'S- ALLOCATIONS AND

00:57:36.586 --> 00:57:38.721
THAT WOULD BENEFIT THE AGAIN

00:57:38.788 --> 00:57:41.658
LIMITS. BUT AGAIN WELL WHEN YOU

00:57:41.724 --> 00:57:43.092
SAY BENEFIT I MADE THE IF IT'S

00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:44.460
OVER THE GAMUT WE WOULD ARGUE

00:57:44.527 --> 00:57:45.562
THAT IT SHOULD BE GIVEN BACK

00:57:45.628 --> 00:57:47.363
RIGHT SO IF YOU EXCLUDE IT THAT

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:48.798
MEANS THAT MONEY DOESN'T HAVE TO

00:57:48.865 --> 00:57:50.366
BE GIVEN BACK. TO THE TO THE

00:57:50.433 --> 00:57:53.269
STATE TAXPAYERS OR TO. OTHER

00:57:53.336 --> 00:57:55.171
INVESTMENTS. YES AND I WOULD

00:57:55.238 --> 00:57:56.873
JUST GET HIGHLIGHTED THIS IS

00:57:56.940 --> 00:57:58.074
SOMETHING THAT WE DID LAST YEAR

00:57:58.141 --> 00:57:59.342
SO IT'S CONSISTENT WITH. BUT

00:57:59.409 --> 00:58:01.611
CURRENT LAW AND THE ACTIONS

00:58:01.678 --> 00:58:04.514
THAT- THIS MARCH OF LAST YEAR.

00:58:04.581 --> 00:58:05.582
BUT OKAY WELL IT'S GETTING IT'S

00:58:05.648 --> 00:58:07.750
CONSISTENT I FIND IT I OPENING

00:58:07.817 --> 00:58:08.785
THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO EXCLUDE

00:58:08.852 --> 00:58:10.019
CERTAIN SOMETHING FOR YOU TRYING

00:58:10.086 --> 00:58:11.688
TO CREATE A FUND TO EXCLUDED OUT

00:58:11.754 --> 00:58:13.089
OF SOMETHING THAT. PROBABLY

00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:15.058
SHOULDN'T BE EXCLUDED- AND THEN

00:58:15.124 --> 00:58:17.527
MY LAST QUESTION MOVING TO- AB

00:58:17.594 --> 00:58:20.997

AS YOU NOTED THE LANGUAGE

00:58:49.392 --> 00:58:51.628
REQUIRES THAT THE DEPARTMENT TO-

00:58:51.694 --> 00:58:53.563
PRIORITIZE COUNTY NONPROFITS IN

00:58:53.630 --> 00:58:56.165
THIS ALLOCATION OF FUNDS- THIS

00:58:56.232 --> 00:58:57.333
IS YOU KNOW CONSISTENT WITH

00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.101
PREVIOUS APPROACH TO THAT

00:58:58.167 --> 00:58:59.235
INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALREADY IN

00:58:59.302 --> 00:59:01.938
PLACE- WE DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC

THE DEPARTMENT WOULD IMPLEMENT

00:59:20.890 --> 00:59:24.093
THAT PRIORITIZATION. BUT WE'RE

THE GOVERNMENT ORDERED CLOSURES
