IT'S OUR IT'S ARE A PLEASURE TO HAVE THIS HEARING ON A SPECIAL TOPIC TO US IN CALIFORNIA IS AN INFORMATIONAL HEARING OF COURSE. THIS HEARING IS FOCUSED ON PRE K. FOR ALL IN CALIFORNIA AND WHAT WE COULD DO IN OUR GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO -- FOCUSING ON WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM OTHER STATES WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA IS THAT BEHIND THE CURVE IN THIS IN THIS ISSUE AND WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR WHAT. WE'RE DOING AND OTHER STATES AND AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT OUR GOVERNOR IS TALKING ABOUT FRIENDS CENTER SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE CAN GO FORWARD TO LOOK AT WHERE WE HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST BUT ALSO LOOK WHAT WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING -- WILL BE JOINED IN A FEW MINUTES AS WELL EIGHT SUPER ATTEND A PUBLIC CONSTRUCT INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND. LAST DECEMBER A SUPERINTENDENT ELECT THEIR MAN I LED A DELEGATION WITH EARLY ADS CALIFORNIA AND SEVERAL PARTNERS FROM CALIFORNIA TRAVELING. TO A BOSTON NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY. LEARNING ABOUT WHAT THEIR STATES AND CITIES ARE DOING A FIRST HAND -- TO BRING ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND HIGHER EARLY EDUCATION EFFORTS FOR OUR OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS AND THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ZEROING IN ON TODAY -- WE ALL KNOW THE WISDOM OF EARLY EDUCATION YOU ASKED -- NOBLE LOWER IT'S LIKE -- MISTER HECKMAN AND PRACTITIONERS AND A FOCUS ON EARLY EDUCATION REALLY IS A DIFFERENCE MAKER FOR OUR KIDS AND OUR FAMILIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA ADDRESSING. OUR EDUCATION ACHIEVEMENT GAP -- DRESSING ISSUES LIKE CHILDHOOD POVERTY AND INTER GENERATIONAL POVERTY AND AS WELL AS LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND KEEPING KIDS. OUT OF THAT PRISON UP -- TO SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE AND SO WE KNOW THAT EARLY EDUCATION WORKS A SOME OF OUR BIG TAKE AWAY IS THAT WE GOT FROM OUR EAST COAST TRIP WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT A LATER TODAY. OUR POLITICAL LEADERSHIP WHICH WERE FORGED OUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND SOME LOGISTICS FACILITIES INFRASTRUCTURE AND INVESTMENTS IN THE WORK FORCE SO -- LOOKING FORWARD TO IT TO GETTING TO IT TO WORK OUR COCHAIR ASSEMBLYMEMBER O'DONNELL TO SAY A FEW WORDS. THANK YOU -- MISTER MCCARTY AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD THIS HEARING AND AND LEARN FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THE FACT EVEN A CONSISTENT CHAMPION -- ON THIS ISSUE -- AS WE ALL KNOW PROVIDING CHILDREN WITH THE QUALITY LEARNING PROGRAM PRIOR TO KINDERGARTEN ENTRY IS OF TREMENDOUS VALUE AS A CLASSROOM TEACHER. AND I KNOW THIS I REMEMBER RIGHT BY WAS AT A MIDDLE SCHOOL THAT WE WENT TO THE KATE MODEL AND I REMEMBER. SITTING AROUND THE THE TEACHERS LOUNGE FOR THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS WHICH WERE NEW TO ME BECAUSE I PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN IN A MIDDLE SCHOOL AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. IN PARTICULAR YOU WOULD HEAR THEM SPEAK OF THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH CHILDREN WHO HAD NOT HAD A PRESCHOOL EXPERIENCE AND THE DIFFERENCE. IN IN IN. IN THE IN THE IN THOSE TWO GROUPS OF STUDENTS SAYS SO THAT IS SOMETHING CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO ADDRESS TO ENSURE SUCCESS. FOR ALL CHILDREN AND MY ONE CONCERN ALL PERCENT HERE TODAY IS IS THE FUNDING. I'M HAPPY TO HEAR ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE BUT I THINK THE REAL CONVERSATION NEEDS TO BE AROUND THE FUNDING HOW DO WE FUND THIS EFFORT. IT CANNOT COME OUT OF THE EXISTING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUCKET OF DOLLARS THERE IS NOT ENOUGH. MONEY IN THAT BUCKET NOW TO SERVE QUE -- SO WE NEED YOU AS A STATE IS A KIND OF PERMANENT CONSISTENT AN ONGOING SOURCE AN ONGOING SOURCE OF FUNDING. FOR FOR THIS NEW. THIS NEW A PRE K. VENTURE WHICH WE ARE ABOUT TO EMBARK ON SO AGAIN I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE. AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVOCACY ON THIS ISSUE AN ALTERNATE BACK TO YOU MISTER MCCARTY OKAY THANK YOU ANY OTHER. INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS AND WE HAVE SOME GUEST HERE DURING SURGERY NOT FROM THIS -- COMMITTEE -- NOR THE AT EDUCATION COMMITTEE BUT LIKE TO ENTERTAIN ANYBODY LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORDS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER ELOISE RIGHT IS ASSEMBLY DISTRICT. AS CHAIR OF THE HUMAN SERVICES COMEDIANS [inaudible] HELLO AGAIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M ELOISE REYES AND I'M THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR THE FORTY SEVENTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT IN SAN BERNADINO. AS CHAIR OF THE HUMAN SERVICES COMMITTEE AND AS A MEMBER OF THE BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. ON EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION THIS PARTICULAR HEARING IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO US -- GOVERNOR BROWN GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAS BEEN A GREAT ADVOCATE FOR THE VERY SUBJECT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND I WERE EVER SO GRATEFUL TO HIM. WE KNOW THAT EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IS QUITE FRANKLY THE GREAT EQUALIZER FOR CALIFORNIA FAMILIES AND CHILDREN. HOWEVER WITHOUT ADEQUATE FINANCING. ON THESE PROGRAMS WILL SIMPLY NOT REACH THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES IN NEED. ARE THIS IS WHY I'M A PROUD CO AUTHOR OF AB ONE TWENTY THREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY. AND WHY I PERSONALLY INTRODUCED AB ONE NINETY FOUR WHICH WOULD ALLOCATE BILLION DOLLARS IN SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE SLOTS. I'M GRATEFUL TO MY COLLEAGUES. SPECIFICALLY ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MCCARTY AND O'DONNELL FOR ENSURING THAT THE BUDGET. AND POLICY COMMITTEES. SHARE DIALOGUE ON THIS TOPIC AS WAS NOTED EARLIER IF WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY DOESN'T MATTER HOW MUCH WE WANTED TO HELP AND IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. I DO WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT MANY OF MY FEMALE COLLEAGUES AND I ARE LEAVING FOR LEGISLATIVE WOMEN'S. OUR CAUCUS RETREAT AT THE MOMENT BUT WE TO THINK THAT THE ISSUE IS OF SERIOUS PRIORITY. FOR WOMEN. ARE AND AND FOR CHILDREN ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND I DON'T WANT TO TO INTERPRET THE FACT THAT TOO MANY OF THE WOMEN WILL BE GONE -- AS ANY INDICATION THAT THAT THIS IS NOT OF INTEREST TO US THIS IS OF GREAT INTEREST. THAT IS WHY MANY OF US ARE HERE BEFORE WE LEAVE TO OUR WOMEN'S RETREAT. I DO WANT TO THANK YOU ALL AND I SEE A GREAT FRIENDS FROM. MIGHT FROM COLTON A SERRA WHO WILL BE SPEAKING WHO IS ON THE AGENDA -- I'M VERY PROUD OF HER AND ALL THAT SHE HAS DONE ALSO -- SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ESTHER'S CHAIRS [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER AT INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF THE MONTH. THANK YOU AT I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS A ONE ECHO WHAT'S BEEN SAID AND THAT HISTORICALLY AND THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AT HAS BEEN AT THE TABLE WITH THIS CONVERSATION ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS -- TO SUPPORT ACCESS AND QUALITY CARE AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BILLS THAT WILL PERHAPS COME UP IN THE DISCUSSION OVER TIME WHETHER IT'S IN TODAY'S HEARING OR ELSEWHERE THAT ADDRESSES -- BY MEMBERS WHO CARE A LOT ABOUT THE ISSUE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE THAT CREPT UP ON US IT'S AN ISSUE. THAT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR DECADES SO I APPRECIATE THE COMMITMENT AND I REGRET THAT. I YOU KNOW I I AND OTHER MEMBERS WILL HAVE TO LEAVE TO CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION IN A IN A DIFFERENT SPACE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND WE HOPE ON THE AGENDA TODAY AT THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS WILL BE TALKING ABOUT EARLY EDUCATION. YES OKAY WELL THANK YOU WILL -- MISTER TERRIBLY THERE ARE MORE MALE LEGISLATORS HERE. YEAH -- BUT NO I II JUST WANT TO QUICKLY JUMP IN BECAUSE AND AS A PARENT. THIS IS A BIGGER ISSUE TO ME AS A TEACHER IS A BIG ISSUE TO ME AND I DON'T THINK IT'S A MALE FEMALE SHIELDING IS A CALIFORNIA ISSUE. THAT WE NEED TO SOLVE ON OUR OWN I DON'T THINK THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S GONNA STEP IN AND HELP US MUCH MORE THEY ALREADY HAVE. SO -- THIS IS THIS IS OUR TIME GET AND I CAN GOING -- TO AT A START NOW WE WE WILL STOP IN A LITTLE BIT WHEN WE HEAR FROM OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT HE WANTS TO COME BY AND HIS WASN'T ABLE TO GET THE VERY BEGINNING BUT HOPEFULLY -- BEFORE WE HEAR FROM OUR DEPARTMENT OF ED WE COULD HAVE INSIDE RIGHT NOW BUT IF NOT WE'LL HAVE A A JUMP IN. WITH WITH THE PROGRAM AND MISTER O'DONNELL TALKED ABOUT CALIFORNIA FUNDING -- EARLY YET SO IT'S PART OF PROP NINETY EIGHT TODAY. AND THAT WE HAVE THAT MAKES DELIVERY SYSTEM FROM GENERAL FUND AND PROP NINETY EIGHT OF COURSE WE WANT TO INVITE UP OUR LA -- WHO APPARENTLY IS FROM CULT IN CALIFORNIA? DID NOT KNOW THAT. TO TO JOIN US INTO GIVE US -- AN OVERVIEW OF EARLY EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA -- HOW THEY'RE FUNDED WHO THEY SIR THINGS ARE I WHERE THE GAS LEE WHERE OPERA THIS TO CALIFORNIA FOR HIGH QUALITY? PROGRAMS THANK YOU -- THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON I'M SERRA CORTEZ WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND I WAS ASKED TO GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF STATE PROGRAMS THAT SERVE. A PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WILL BE SPEAKING FROM THE HAND OUT THAT'S BEING DISTRIBUTED TO YOU -- SO FIRST I'LL BRIEFLY DISCUSS -- THE STATE'S CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS GENERALLY OF THEN I'LL GO INTO MORE DETAIL ON PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS. SO THE STATE ADMINISTERS SEVERAL CHILD CARE AND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS FOR PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN THE FIGURE ON PAGE ONE SHOWS THE PROGRAMS AND KEY ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. FROM THIS FIGURE YOU CAN SEE THAT THE TOP TWO PROGRAMS LISTED ARE MORE GENERALLY FOR CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE. THIRTEEN WELL THE BOTTOM TWO PROGRAMS LISTED ARE FOR PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN CHILDREN AGES THREE AND OR FOUR YEARS OLD. THE STATE SPEND ROUGHLY FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION ADMINISTERING THESE PROGRAMS. ON PAGE TWO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE STATE SERVES ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND CHILDREN. THE STATE -- FOR IT A SEVENTY THOUSAND CHILDREN IN THESE PROGRAMS AND THIS FIGURE SHOWS HOW SLAUGHTER DISTRIBUTED ACROSS EACH PROGRAM. SO A LITTLE MORE THAN HALF OF THE SLOTS ARE FOR PROGRAMS THAT SPECIFICALLY SIR PRESCHOOL AGE SHOW OF PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN AND THAT'S THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. SO ON PAGE THREE OF YOUR HAND OUT SHOWS THE TABLE COMPARING STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS SERVING PRESCHOOL AGE CHILDREN MORE SPECIFICALLY. AND THIS TABLE ALSO INCLUDES HEAD START A FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAM. THIS TABLES PRIMARILY FOR YOUR RESOURCE BUT I DID WANT TO POINT OUT A FEW THINGS. SO STATE PRESCHOOL -- THE CONTRACTOR VOUCHER PROGRAMS AND THE HEAD START PROGRAM ALL HAVE INCOME ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS -- TO FAMILIES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THESE PER LEARN WILL HAVE TO EARN LESS THAN A SPECIFIED INCOME AMOUNT FOR THEIR FAMILIES -- AND SO THE STATE PROGRAMS ALLOW FAMILIES TO HAVE HIGHER INCOMES COMPARED TO HEAD START AND YOU COULD SEE THE INCOME. ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS HERE. THE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM IS A PROGRAM THAT DOESN'T HAVE AN INCOME ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. THE OTHER THINGS I WILL POINT OUT IS THAT THESE PROGRAMS CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY PROGRAMMATIC LEASE TO FOR EXAMPLE STATE PRESCHOOL COULD OFFER A THREE HOUR PROGRAM OR A TEN HOUR PROGRAM -- DAILY PROGRAM FOR A CHILD -- A CHILD COULD ALSO RECEIVING THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM SOMETHING THAT ALIGNS A HUNDRED SOMETHING THAT ALIGNS WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHICH WOULD BE A HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS OUT OF THE YEAR OR SOMETHING THAT'S YEAR ROUND THAT COULD WE OFFER PROGRAMS FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DAYS A YEAR. AND TURNING TO PAGE FOUR ON THE CHART ON PAGE FOUR SHOWS THAT MORE THAN HALF OF LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE SERVED IN A STATE FUNDED PROGRAM. SO WE ESTIMATE THE STATE US THE STATE HAS ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS CHART WERE DEFINING LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS. AS THE FOUR YEAR OLD IN A FAMILY THAT HAS AN INCOME AT OR BELOW THE 85% OF THE STATE MEDIAN INCOME. AND THIS IS THE INCOME ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR STATE PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE PROGRAMS EFFECTIVE JULY. TWENTY NINETEEN NOW I MENTION THIS BECAUSE USING THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY INCOME ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA INSTEAD OF THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN INCOME ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. AS AN ESTIMATED FIFTY THOUSAND ELIGIBLE FOUR YEAR OLDS. SO WE WERE TO DEVELOP THIS FIGURE USING TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN ELIGIBILITY THIS FIGURE WOULD LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENT. SO FROM THIS TO FIGURE STATE PRESCHOOL SERVES THE LARGER SHARE OF THE POPULATION. FOLLOWED BY TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND FOLLOWED BY OTHER STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS. THE OTHER STATE FOR UNDER PROGRAMS CATEGORY INCLUDES GENERAL CHILD CARE ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT AND CAL WORKS CHILD CARE -- FROM THIS OTHER CATEGORY OF ROUGHLY 40% -- IT'S ABOUT ROUGHLY 40% OF LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS. IN THIS CATEGORY INCLUDE CHILDREN SERVED IN HEAD START CHILDREN SERVED LOCALLY FUNDED PROGRAMS. CHILDREN WHOSE FAMILY PAY FOR CHILD FOR PRESCHOOL PRIVATELY. ON THIS CATEGORY ALSO INCLUDE CHILDREN THAT ARE UNSERVED HOWEVER WE DON'T HAVE DATA TO ESTIMATE WHICH SHARE OF THIS -- WHICH CHAIR OF THE OTHER CATEGORY IS UNSERVED OR WHAT SHARE PARTICIPATES IN SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT I JUST MENTIONED. SO WE GROUP THIS CATEGORY THIS WAY BECAUSE OF OUR DATA LIMITATIONS OF THE PRIME EXAMPLES CHILDREN SERVED IN HEAD START. OUR UNDERSTANDING IS MANY ARE DULY ENROLLED IN HEAD START IN STATE PRESCHOOL. STILL WE WERE TO USE THE DATA THAT HEAD START REPORTS -- THEY SERVE IN THIS FIGURE THAT WOULD OVER -- THE CHILDREN SERVED. UP AND THAT CONCLUDES MY PREPARED REMARKS BUT I'M HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS OKAY. THANK YOU. I THINK I'LL START WITH WITH THE KEY QUESTION KIND OF WHERE WE HEAR TODAY IS WE THINK THERE ARE. THOUSANDS IF NOT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS WHO ARE NOT SERVICE. AND SO I KNOW THAT -- THAT -- NEAR AND OTHERS HAVE PUT OUT SOME NUMBERS AS FAR AS HOW MANY. LOW INCOME THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE UNSERVED AND YOU KNOW. THAT THE YOU KNOW THOSE NUMBERS I'M SURE OF COURSE -- IF YOU COULD ELUDE TO THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IN YOUR CHART YOU SAY WE DON'T NOW BUT MAYBE YOU COULD TALK WHAT. OTHERS ARE SAYING AS FAR AS HOW MANY AYE AYE WE'VE HEARD BETWEEN THIRTY AND FIFTY THOUSAND OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS OF LOW INCOME FOUR YEAR OLDS AT ARTS IN EITHER TKA. STATE PRESCHOOL OR OR HEAD START AND WONDER IF YOU COULD ENLIGHTEN US A BIT MORE ON THAT. YES A SOME SO SOME OF THE I'VE SEEN -- HAVE BEEN MORE GENERALLY. FOR LOOKING AT ELIGIBLE FISH -- CHILDREN AND FAMILIES UNDER THE AGE OF THIRTEEN SO I'VE SEEN FIGURES -- RELATED TO THAT I'VE SEEN SOME SPECIFIC -- BETWEEN AGES. THREE SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN -- THOSE OF PARTICULAR FIGURES WOULD MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT -- DUAL ENROLLMENT THAT -- WE DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE MAKING FUN BUT IT'S AN H. IT WOULD JUST DEPEND -- BUT MY DOES THAT WORK ABOUT THE WITH THE LEAD FINANCE OFFICE I THINK RIGHT THEIR NUMBER NUMBER OF DIFFERENT THE DIFFERENT NUMBERS THAT ARE OUT THERE I THINK. AND ALL AND WE HAVE ALSO CHANGED THE INCOME ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAST FEW YEARS SO -- THESE THESE DIFFERENT NUMBERS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS ALL OF THEM WILL BE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT -- AND AND SO I THINK THAT THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN -- SEND THE DIFFICULT INTERNET PAID TO A SPECIFIC NUMBER BUT EITHER WAY WITH ANY OF THE NUMBERS THAT YOU HAVE YOUR WERE TALKING ABOUT -- AND THE OF MANY TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ELIGIBLE FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS THAT ARE THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE THAT ARE NOT BEING SERVE RIGHT NOW SO REGARDLESS OF WHICH NUMBER YOU TAKE I THINK THEY'RE STILL. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF CHILDREN ACROSS THE STATE IN THAT ARE FOUR YEARS OLD THAT THAT THAT ARE NOT BEING SERVED AND THEN I'M NOT WHAT THEY ALSO -- THE FOUR YEAR OLD OF ALL OUR AGES FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE PROBABLY THE HIGHEST SERVE THE BALL SO WE DID THE THING CHART FOR THREE YEAR OLDS WE DON'T HAVE TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN WE HAVEN'T MUCH. SMALLER PROPORTION OF THEM BEING SERVED IN THE PRESCHOOL YOU WOULD HAVE A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THEM -- THAT ARE BEING SERVED SO. THIS IS CHAU THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EXPENDING SERVICES TO THE THE CHILDREN THAT WE THINK ARE THE HIGHEST ME WHICH OF CHILDREN WHO ARE OR LOW INCOME. AND THEN A FOLLOW UP QUESTION IN THE LAST FEW YEARS SINCE THE LAST FIVE YEARS WE I THINK HAD -- DIRECTING ITS LAST SIX YEARS FOR MAJOR BUDGET INCREASES TO INCREASE LOTS. AND TO MAKE SUCCESS MAINLY POSITIVE SUCCESS BUT IN THE LAST COUPLE. ITERATIONS OF BUDGET ACTIONS WITH INCREASE LOTS IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM NOT THAT THE OTHER JUST THIS SPECIFICALLY. THERE ARE SOME LIMITATIONS ON THE MONEY'S COMING BACK IN AND WONDER IF THE LA -- HAS ANY THOUGHTS -- IDEAS ON WHY THAT IS OR WHAT WE COULD BE DOING DIFFERENTLY WITH WITH RELATION TO FACILITIES -- REIMBURSEMENT RATES WORKFORCE NEEDS. SO. FOR THE FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE THE WHERE THERE WERE. I THINK A LITTLE BIT LESS THAN THREE THOUSAND SLOTS THAT WERE APPROVED OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD THEY ALL WENT TO THEY WERE AWFUL DAY SLOTS THAT WENT TO EL THE ACE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE COUNTY UP. EDUCATION ABOUT BECAUSE THE FUNDING WAS LIMITED TO PROPOSITION NINETY FUNDING. I'M SO WE WE HAVE HEARD OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME DIFFICULTY IN GETTING THOSE SLOTS USED A LOT ABOUT FUNDING HAVE COME BACK -- HAS AND IT'S BEEN IN USE THAT IN SOME CASES THE DEPARTMENT HAS TAKEN THAT INSTEAD OF ENDING INSTEAD READ DURING OUR A NEW REQUEST FOR APPLICATIONS AND ISSUING THAT -- THOSE SLOTS AT THE SLOTS FOR ELEAZAR AND SOMETIMES ALSO NON NON ELLIE IS AS WELL -- SO WE HAVE HEARD THAT THERE IS THIS CONCERNING THINK WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT'S GOING ON AND IT'S IT'S HARD TO KNOW THE EXACT REASON. ONE POSSIBILITY IS THAT -- DISTRICTS FOR IF IN OUR DISCUSSION WITH -- FOLKS IN THE FIELD DISTRICTS SEEM TO BE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO WANT TO OFFER FULL DAY PROGRAM THEY PREFER OFFER THE PARTY SCHOOL YOUR PROGRAM SO BY. YOUR MARKING IT TO ELEAZAR MIGHT HAVE LIMITED THAT THE SORT OF TAKE UP OF THE SLOTS -- NOT LEDS ARE MUCH MORE LIKELY TO OFFER FULL DAY PROGRAMS IN MAY AND SO -- PERHAPS DISTRIBUTING IT TO NOT ALWAYS MIGHT INCREASE THE AMOUNT THAT THAT WE WITH THE TAKEN UP. DISTRICTS ARE DEALING WITH THEIR OWN FACILITIES ARE BEFORE WHO'VE BEEN -- THEY'VE BEEN USING SOME OF THEIR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOMS TO DO MORE TO QUE OUR EXPANDED TO GET A WE MIGHT NOT HAVE SPACE FOR SOME OF THESE ARE. OF ADDITIONAL DAY PRESCHOOLS LOTS. OKAY THANK YOU. SMALL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FOR THE LA A OKAY THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION. ALREADY NEXT FOR OUR NEXT -- PANEL WE'RE GONNA HAVE DOCTOR ELLEN FREAKY SHE'S WITH THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR EARLY. EDUCATION RESEARCH -- NEAR FOR THOSE OF US THAT FOLLOW YOUR WORK MORE CLOSELY. AND SHE'S GOING TO BE DISCUSSING UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL PRE K. FOR ALL BEST PRACTICES FROM OTHER STATES AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU AND I REALLY APPRECIATE BEING INVITED HERE AS AN OUTSIDER FROM ANOTHER STATE I I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I IN THE EARLY EIGHTIES. I SPENT ALMOST TWO WEEKS OUT OF EVERY MONTH IN LA WORKING WITH LA COUNTY HEAD START AND SO I KNOW HOW LONG YOU'VE. MANY OF THOSE CLASSROOMS ACTUALLY WERE ALSO STATE LONG CALIFORNIA'S BEEN WORKING ON THIS ISSUE AND HOW MANY. HOW HOW MUCH? BROWN HAS ALREADY BEEN CELLS BUT THERE'S CLEARLY STILL SOME WORK TO DO AND I'M EXCITED THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU'RE DOING IT. SO I'M ALLEN FREE AND I'M SENIOR CO DIRECTOR AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR EARLY EDUCATION RESEARCH -- WE'RE AT AN INSTITUTE OF RECORDS UNIVERSITY AND CONDUCT RESEARCH TO INFORM PUBLIC POLICY AROUND MOST ON EARLY EDUCATION GENERALLY BUT CPAS MOST SPECIFICALLY AROUND PRESCHOOL AND ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE ARMED BUT THAT MOST KNOWN FOR IS ARE YOUR BOOK WHICH SHALL BE. ALLUDING TO A LITTLE BIT TODAY IN CHERRY SHOWING YOU SOME DATA FROM THAT -- BUT FIRST I WANT TO IF YOU LOOK AT THEM. SLIDE TO I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE RESEARCH MORE GENERALLY AROUND WHAT IT TAKES TO ACTUALLY HAVE A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THAT. LEADS TO LASTING EFFECTS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN. AND I'M BORROWING AT A TERM FROM ONE OF YOUR NATIVE DAUGHTERS MARCY WHITE BURKE BUCK FROM UNIVERSITY -- I'M FROM BERKELEY. THE BUT I'VE BEEN NO SINGLE INGREDIENT SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT WE CAN'T DO PRE K. WITH JUST. GETTING ONE THING RIGHT. THIRD UP A CONSTELLATION OF FACTORS THAT HAVE TO BE IN PLACE TO REALLY MOVE THE BAR IN TERMS OF CHILDREN'S OUT COMES. THE AND WE HAVE SEARCH THAT YOU'VE ALLUDED. TO ABOUT -- THE HOW ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE AND THE EFFECT OF PRESCHOOL BUT WE ALSO HAVE. THAT SAME BODY RESEARCH SHOWS US HOW OFTEN WE GET IT WRONG. AND SO I'M REALLY HOPEFUL THAT WITH THIS MOVE YOU'RE GOING TO GET IT RIGHT AND YOU'LL HAVE A PROGRAM THAT THAT REALLY MAKES THE DIFFERENCE AND SO. IT'S LIKE -- TO DESCRIBES. SOME OF THESE. ESSENTIAL INGREDIENTS AND I'M CALLING THEM THE CENTRAL ON PURPOSE IN OTHER WORDS YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE ONE FROM COLUMN A AND NOT TAKE ONE FROM COLUMN BAY. THE FIRST THREE I THINK COULD GENERALLY BE TO DESCRIBE THIS. CRITICAL -- STRUCTURAL POLICY ELEMENTS THERE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE REQUIRED AND PUT IN PLACE -- AT THE POLICY LEVEL AND FUNDED. AND AND THEIR THE HARDEST THINGS IN MANY WAYS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES THAT CHEN THAT DO NEED TO GENERATE MORE FUNDS -- THE FIRST IS THE THAT TEACHERS NEED TO BE WELL EDUCATED AND AM. FAIRLY COMPENSATED [inaudible] AND AT THE SAME TIME THEY ALSO NEED TO HAVE EXPERT LEADERS SAY THE AGAIN IT'S IT'S NOT AN EITHER OR IT'S A BOTH. THEY AN ADEQUATE DOSAGE WE'RE NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT IT TAKES BUT WE KNOW THAT TWO YEARS GETS BETTER RESULTS THAN. ONE AND WE KNOW THAT FULL DAY GETS BETTER RESULTS THAN HALF. TWO YEARS OF A MEDIOCRE PROGRAM PROBABLY DOESN'T DOUBLE THE A FAX -- YOU'VE YOU'VE WE ARE PRETTY IT'S PRETTY MUCH AGAIN ALL THE INGREDIENTS HAVE TO BE IN PLACE -- FOR SMALL CLASS SIZES WITH REASONABLE STAFF CHILD RATIOS IT'S NOT THERE'S NOT A PERFECT ANSWER TO THAT. I'LL BE SHOWING YOU SOME DIFFERENT EXAMPLES BUT SO WHAT THE OTHER FEATURES ARE IN THE PROGRAM THAT WE KNOW THAT HAVING NO CLASS SIZE LIMIT IS NOT A GOOD CHOICE. AND THE THEN THE OTHER THROUGH THE NEXT THREE ITEMS HERE ARE INGREDIENTS TO REALLY LOOK AT THE PROGRAMMATIC ELEMENTS WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE SYSTEM. AND AND AND AND THAT SUPPORT TEACHERS TEACH WELL. AND THOSE HAVE TO DO WITH SOMETHING THAT YOU HAVE MOST OF IN PLACE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. GOOD LEARNING STANDARDS THAT ARE COMPREHENSIVE -- THAT ARE. THE ONE THING YOU'RE KIND OF MISSING IS ENSURING THAT YOUR CURRICULUM IS DIRECTLY RELATED. TO THE STANDARDS AND DESIGNED. TO ENSURE CHILDREN LEARN THEM. AND AN ASSESSMENT SYSTEM THAT HELPS INFORM TEACHING. THAT'S RELATED TO THAT CURRICULUM AND NOT JUST THE STANDARDS BUT TO THE CURRICULUM AS WELL AND THEN FINALLY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THAT. THINK THAT AGAIN IS IS PART OF THIS FULLY INTEGRATED. APPROACH -- RELATED TO THAT OF COURSE IS A COHERENT -- SYSTEM FOR REVIEW AND EFFORT FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW HOW WELL THEY'RE DOING AND YOU WANT TO HAVE THAT AT AT AT AND THAT. THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL SO THAT. THAT OR AT SOME KIND OF LARGER GOVERNING BODY LEVEL IT COULD BE REGIONAL OR EVEN DISTRICT -- RELATED TO CONTINUOUS DATA DRIVEN IMPROVEMENT SYSTEMS DATE AT THE CHILD LEVEL AT THE CLASSROOM LEVEL. AT THE BUILDING LEVEL AT EVERY LEVEL SO THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT HOW THEY'RE DOING AND CORRECTING SHIP AS THEY'RE GOING ALONG. SO -- NOW WILL TURN TO SOME DATA ABOUT CALIFORNIA I KNOW THAT YOU WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT SOME NUMBERS AND WE'RE GOING TO ARE GOING TO CONTRADICT THE LA A LITTLE BIT BUT IT'S JUST BECAUSE THE WAY WE LOOK AT THINGS. WHEN WE DO THE STATE PRE K. YEARBOOK WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL FIFTY STATES SEVEN OF WHICH HAVE NO PRE K. PROGRAM AND THEY GET A PAGE IN OUR YOUR BOOK THAT SAYS NO PRESCHOOL PROGRAM? IS THAT THE WALL OF SHAME OR THE PAGE IF SHE TO CALL IN THE WILDERNESS STATES BECAUSE MOST OF OUR OUT IN THE NORTH WEST AND HAVE. THE WE LOOK AT THREE SORT OF LEGS OF THE STOOL OF AT WILL -- AT THE STATE POLICY LEVEL SO ONE IS FUNDING AND RESOURCES ONE IS ACCESS AND HOW MANY CHILDREN -- ARNOLD. AND THEN THE THIRD IS QUALITY -- AND WE THINK ABOUT THE QUALITY AS THE MINIMAL POLICY STANDARDS THAT NEED TO BE IN PLACE IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I SAY THAT BECAUSE THESE DO NOT GUARANTEE. YOU'LL GET LONGITUDINAL RESULTS THIS IS THESE ARE JUST THE MINIMAL POLICY STANDARDS SO HOW DOES CALIFORNIA RANK WELL. IF WE LOOK AT CAL ENROLLMENT IN THE PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN IN THIS IS WHERE OUR NUMBERS DIFFER A LITTLE BIT -- IF WE PUT THE CALIFORNIA. STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM ANTI K. TOGETHER FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS. RANK THIRTEENTH OUT OF THE FIFTY STATES BUT IF WE TAKE T. K. OUT -- THEN YOU'RE THE RANKING -- GOES DOWN -- TO THIRTY AND YOU'RE ONLY SERVING ABOUT 17% OR LESS AND ABOUT GRAHAM I APOLOGIZE THESE ARE FIGURES FOR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN SCHOOL YEAR WE'RE DOESN'T JUST NOW WORKING ON THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN YEAR BUT AND THEN. RESOURCES IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WHERE YOUR THE RESOURCE THAT ARE GOING INTO THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM NOT T. K. ARE PRETTY SUS COMPARABLE TO YOUR TICKET RESOURCES. SO YOU'RE AT YOUR RANK ABOUT OF FORT FOURTEENTH OR THIRTEENTH DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT FOR FOR RESOURCES BUT AN IMPORTANT THING TO LOOK AT IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF SITE. THREE THAT LITTLE ASTERIX. THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THAT PRESCHOOL SHOULD COSTS DRAMATICALLY LESS. BANGKIT TROUGH. AND YOUR YOUR YOUR YOUR PREFERRED PK DOLLARS ARE DRAMATICALLY LESS THAN TWELVE DOLLARS SO THAT SOMETHING AND AND AND THEN THAT SHOWS IF YOU LOOK ON SLIDE. FOR THAT SHOWS IN YOUR QUALITY BENCHMARKS -- WE HAVE TEN SPECIFIC -- POLICIES THAT WE LOOK AT A CALIFORNIA STATE PRE K.. MEET SIX OF THOSE TEN AND THAT THE FOR THAT YOU'RE MISSING AGAIN ARE THE ONES THAT OFTEN ARE THE MORE EXPENSIVE ONES THE SO THE CLASS SIZE OF TWINS TO INTERPRET BECAUSE THAT EACH THAT'S BECAUSE OF TKA. ARE BIG CLASS I'D LIKE THINK YOU ALSO DON'T HAVE A SIZE LIMIT IN YOUR PRESCHOOL PROGRAM IN ALL YEAH WE HAVE THE RATIO BUT NOT YEAH YOU HAVE THE RATIO BUT NOT THAT LHASA YES SO YOU GET ONE OF THEM. AND MY CONCERN WITH THE RATIO I WOULD JUST SAY IS. A RATE RATIO -- IF IT'S JUST ADULTS TO CHILDREN BUT GIVEN YOUR ASSISTANT TEACHER QUALIFICATION RULES. THAT. AGAIN NOT. MANY OF THOSE TEACHERS ARE GOING TO BE EXCELLENT BUT MANY ARE NOT -- AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE PAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE HAVING A LOT OF TURN OF ITS RESULT OF THAT -- SO THE THAT ONE TO EIGHT RATIOS GREAT AND MAYBE YOU COULD DO THAT WOULD AND CLASS AS A TWENTY FOUR WE DON'T HAVE ANY GOOD DAY TO SAY THAT YOU CAN DO THAT BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S SOMETHING YOU COULD. ASK BET WHEN TO WHEN WHEN THAT THAT ADULTS IN IN EVERY CASE IT WELL IN. FOR TWO THIRDS OF THE CLASSROOM AS AN ADULT WITH THE HIS USE A CONSIDERED IT AT AN ASSISTANT TEACHER THEN YOU'RE. IT'S BEGINNING TO BE AN ISSUE I THINK IN TERMS OF THE THE THE FACT THAT [inaudible] YOU. YOU DON'T RECEIVE THE BENCHMARK ON ONGOING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ON TEACHER QUALIFICATION AN ASSISTANT TEACHER QUALIFICATION AND IT BE IT BEGINS TO COMPOUND AND THAT'S THAT'S A CONCERN THAT I WOULD HAVE -- SO. I'LL TURN OUT IT TO TALKING ABOUT THE PROGRAM IN NEW JERSEY THAT -- THE DELEGATION WENT. WENT TO VISIT ITS ON ON SLIDE FIVE THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF ON THIS SITE THAT ALL DOCTOR FREE. TONIGHT CAN WE AT WE LOVE THIS EVERYONE I WANT TO REALLY GET INTO IT. ANSWER QUESTIONS BUT WE TAKE TO A TIME OUT FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND HAVE YOU COME BACK IN A SEC YOU CAN ACTUALLY STAY RIGHT THERE OKAY -- WE'RE GONNA BRING UP OUR SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION MISTER THURMAN'S -- WELCOME BACK TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY TO THE END COMMITTEE.

IN THEIR MANY TAKE AWAYS AND BUT ONE OF THE MAIN TAKEAWAYS FROM ME IS. OUT WE ARE CALIFORNIA. AND WE SHOULD LEAD. AND AS THE STATE'S -- HAVE SHOWN US WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO ACCOMPLISH UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS CLEAR TO ME -- THEY MADE SMART CHOICES AND GOOD INVESTMENTS. AND THEY'RE BEGINNING TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF THOSE DECISIONS. BUT THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING THAT WE DON'T ALREADY KNOW HOW TO DO. AND WE HAVEN'T HAD THE POLITICAL WILL IN THE STATE TO DO IT AND NOW WE DO -- BECAUSE YOUR LEADERSHIP AND THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. AND A GOVERNOR WHO GETS IT -- AND GREAT EXPERTS IN PARTNERS WE'VE HEARD FROM TODAY WHO SEND ME OUT ON MISSIONS TO GET THEM COFFEE AND TEA -- WHATEVER IT TAKES RIGHT SAYING WHAT EVER IT TAKES TO GET THE JOB DONE. AND WE'RE DELIGHTED THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS ARTICULATED A VISION FOR OUR UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL AND FOR EARLY CARE IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE MENU OF SERVICE DELIVERY -- AND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF STICKY ISSUES THAT HAVE TO GET A DRESS LIKE WORK FORCE AND IS IT RATES IN ITS SLOT -- TO START FOR YOU KNOW FOR YOUR ROLES AND THEN YOU KNOW WORK YOUR WAY DOWN -- BUT LET'S DO SOMETHING I THINK THE GOVERNOR IS A A MARKER DOWN. AND SAID THAT WE WILL GET THIS DONE I'M SO THRILLED THAT WE HAVE A GREAT DIVISION. AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ARE EARLY CARE DIVISION IS READY OUR EARLY LEARNING DIVISION IS READY TO GET IT. DONE WE HAVE. WE HAVE A LEADER WHO YOU'LL HEAR FROM IN A MOMENT -- WHO IS BAR NONE AND I THINK ONE OF THE GREATEST LEADERS ON THESE TOPICS ANYWHERE IN THE NATION? AND I THINK EVERYTHING SHE TELL ME WHAT TO SAY AT THE TIMING IS NOW -- WE'RE COMMITTED TO SAID JUST READ THE NOTES -- PARTS ALWAYS BETTER YOU KNOW ME AS SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW ME TO CHAIR -- THIS IS SOMETHING I CARE ABOUT BECAUSE WE CAN CLOSEST. WE CAN ASSURE THAT EVERY TODAY TODAY WE HOSTED OUR FIRST IN A SERIES. OF ROUND TABLES ABOUT CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP [inaudible] AND A HUNDRED PEOPLE SHOWED UP. THEN I ASK THE PEOPLE IN THAT ROOM IF THEY WOULD COMMIT WITH ME. TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY YOUNG PERSON. WHO ENTERS SCHOOL IN SEPTEMBER? WE WE DON'T TRACK THEM BUT WE KEEP TRACK OF THEIR PROGRESS. IN THEIR ABILITY TO LEARN TO READ BY THIRD GRADE. THE WE CAN CHANGE THE CONVERSATION. THAT WE CAN SAY THAT FROM THIS POINT FORWARD FROM NOW ON ALL OF OUR KIDS LEARN TO READ BY THIRD GRADE. AND THAT WE CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT STARZ BEFORE KINDERGARTEN. AND SO. WITH YOUR PERMISSION MISTER CHAIR LIKE TO TURN IT OVER.

BUT FOR ITS GOT BACK HE TELLS THE DETAILS RIGHT THE NUANCES HOW WE FIND IT WITH THE ELEMENTS ARE. NOT SAID THE REST OF THE HEARING WILL SAY BUT I LIKE CALCULATED OUT THERE ONE THING. LIKE THINK SO IMPORTANT IS HE'S TALK ABOUT CALIFORNIA LEADING WE LEAD IN. VIA MENTAL ISSUES -- HEALTH CARE YOU KNOW TAKEN ON THE GUN LOBBY TOBACCO INDUSTRY IN OUR HIGHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS BUT IN THIS ONE WERE WAY. BOTTOM AND AND THERE'S A THING FOR ME MOMENT HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF THEIR KIDS GOING TO PRE K. PROGRAM. THERE ARE RED STATES. MAJORITY OF THEM ARE LED BY REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS SO THIS IS NOT. A RED VERSUS BLUE DEMOCRAT REPUBLICAN THIS IS YOU KNOW COMMONSENSE EARLY EDUCATION MATTERS SO THANKS FOR THAT FOR THE REMINDER SUPERINTENDENT THANK YOU WERE AT YOUR DISPOSAL YOU'VE GOT SOME GREAT MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE PLEASE GIVE OUR REGARDS. BUT TO THE CHAIR WHO I KNOW IS PROBABLY ON IMPORTANT BUSINESS ON WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH IT'S A MEMBER KALRA.

YOU KNOW JUST A GREAT COMMITTEE OF EDUCATORS AND WE STAND -- ALL TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OF US OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION STAND READY TO HELP YOU IMPLEMENT THIS THE TIME IS NOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WORKING WITH US. DON'T GO FAR THIS LEVEL MORE OKAY [inaudible] OKAY SO. A DOCTOR WILL COME BACK TO YOU. KATE SO I WAS ACTUALLY JUST GOING INTO NEW JERSEY SAID THAT THAT WAS AGAIN A GOOD SPOT -- SO I WAS AN ASSISTANT TO THE COMMISSIONER FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IN NEW JERSEY WHEN OUR PRESCHOOL PROGRAM WAS EXPANDING AND BEING FORMED -- IT'S A UNUSUAL PROGRAM IN THAT IT WAS COURT ORDERED AND UNDER SCHOOL FUNDING -- COURT CASE THAT'S LONG STANDING IT'S NOW. FIFTY YEARS OLD. THE THE BUT I WON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME. GOING INTO DETAIL ABOUT ABOUT THAT THAT THAT BUT I DO WANT TO TELL YOU THAT. THE OUR NEW JERSEY PROGRAM MATT ALL OF THOSE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS THAT ARE IN GREEDY KEY INGREDIENTS THAT I TALKED ABOUT EARLIER. ON SLIDE -- TO FUNDING WAS WAS MANDATED FOR ALL THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS. AS IT WAS AT UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN THIRTY ONE LOW INCOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS. SO WE DID AND THAT WITH OF WHAT. PRESCHOOL POPULATION OF THOSE. SCHOOL DISTRICTS WAS WAS. OVER SIXTY THOUSAND SO IT'S NOTHING LIKE THE MAGNITUDE OF SCALE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT -- NEW JERSEY IS DENSELY POPULATED BUT TINY SO OUR OUR TOTAL POPULATION IS IS IS SMALL COMPARED TO YOURS -- THE FUNDING THAT WENT INTO THIS PROGRAM FIRST WAS USED TO IMPROVE PROGRAM STANDARDS. AND THE KINDS OF THINGS I TALKED ABOUT TEACHERS WITH BACHELOR'S DEGREES PAID. AT PARITY ON THE SAME CELL RISK LIST OF WHERE THEY TAUGHT -- IT WAS A MIXED DELIVERY SYSTEM AND THAT IN THE BEGINNING TWO THIRDS OF THE CHILDREN WERE SERVED AND PRIVATE PROVIDER CLASSROOMS EITHER CHILD LICENSED CHILDCARE CENTERS OR HEAD START PROGRAMS -- AND THEN THE OTHER THIRD IN PUBLIC SCHOOL CLASSROOMS BUT THERE WAS ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND THAT WAS BECAUSE IT WAS A PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAM AND IT'S A PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAM. THE THE QUALITY AND AS A RESULT OF THAT FUNDING AND IMPROVE STANDARDS AND THEN PLAYED RESOURCES. AND A LOT OF SUPPORT TO PROGRAMS QUALITY IN THE CLASSROOMS IMPROVE DRAMATICALLY OVER THE FIRST. THREE YEARS AND THEN BY BY THE TIME THE PROGRAM WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD IT WAS IT WAS QUITE GOOD. AND THAT YOU CAN SEE IN THE SMALL SLIDE IN THIS INSIGHT IS. INSERTED SLIGHT GOT GRAPH ON THE LEFT HAND CORNER YOU'LL SEE HOW AT THE CRAFT SKEWS TO THE RIGHT AND THAT'S AS TIME GOES BY THAT. THE PROGRAM IMPROVES AND REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT. NO CLASSROOMS SCORED AND THE AREA THAT WOULD BE CALLED CAN TO POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS FOR CHILDREN ARE HARMFUL TO CHILDREN. AND VERY FEW SCORED BELOW THE MIDLINE BY THE END OF THIS AT THIS PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT IN THE RESOURCES GOING AND SO IT TOOK ABOUT THREE SOURCES AND PROGRAM IMPROVEMENTS -- INITIATIVES. WHAT HAPPENED AS A RESULT YOU'LL SEE ON THE SLIDE AT THE? RIGHT THAT GRAPH AT THE RIGHT UPPER RIGHT HAND OF THE SLIDE -- FIVE FOURTH AND FIFTH GRADE WE WERE DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THAT. HAD THEIR MATIC EFFECTS ON CHILDREN'S STATE TESTED -- ABILITIES AND AND THE STATE ACHIEVEMENT TEST IN SOME CASES ARE UP TO ALMOST CLOSE 240%. OF AN EFFECT SIZE OF ALMOST FORTY WHICH IS BEING ABOUT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP SO WERE CAUSING A GREAT A GREAT PERCENTAGE OF THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND AND SOME -- SUBJECT A MAN'S AN AN IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET WE ALSO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE SPECIAL EDUCATION AND GRADE RETENTION. BOTH OF WHICH ARE COSTLY AND WHAT YOU SEE ON THE SMALL SIDE AT THE TOP IS THAT TWO YEARS WAS BETTER THAN. ONE AND IT BUT WITH BUT ONE STILL HAD SOME HAD HAD CONSIDERABLE IMPACT. SO WHAT I KNOW THAT YOU ALL ARE VERY INTERESTED SORRY THAT'S MY TEXAN ISM COMING OUT I GREW UP IN TEXAS -- BY THE WAY THAT'S ONE OF THE OTHER STATES THAT HAS NO CLASS SIZE LIMIT ON PRE K. SO. YOU GOT OUT SCORE TEXAS ON AS A THE THE I WANNA TALK ABOUT HOW WE GOT FROM. A SYSTEM WHICH IN MOST AND MANY OF THE CLASSROOM IN MOST OF THE CLASSROOMS THAT. THAT THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE ABBOTT PRICKETT COMING AND THE TEACHERS DIDN'T WERE NOT QUALIFIED AND DID NOT HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE -- AND WE TOOK THAT WORK FORCE AND GREW THEM TO BE -- TO BE QUALIFIED INTO WE WE BUILT ON THE CURRENT WORK FORCE WHEN WE DID THIS AND WETHINK THAT'S A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THING THEY BROUGHT EXPERTISE AND EXPERIENCE FREE FOR ME FROM YEARS OF WORKING WITH CHILDREN. THEY HAD SHOWN THEY HAD. AT A GREAT APPLICATION FOR THIS BUT DIDN'T YET HAVE THE FULL PREPARATION. AND THAT WAS NECESSARY FOR IT TO BE A FULLY EDUCATIONAL PRIME DOESN'T MEAN MANY OF THE MORE EXCELLENT TEACHERS -- BUT BUT YOU CAN SEE FROM THE QUALITY THAT THAT IMPROVE DRAMATICALLY AS THEY WENT BACK TO SCHOOL AND GOT MORE TRAINING -- SO HOW DO WE CALL HOW DO WE PAY FOR THIS AND ITS IT'S AND WHAT PERSONAL WHAT WHAT DID WE PAY -- FOR WE HAVEN'T SO. ON THE ON THE NEXT SLIDE INSIDE SEXUAL SEE THAT THEY WERE IT STARTED AND THEN WHAT SOME OF THE REMEDIES WERE ON THE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE. SO WE HAD A LIMITED QUALIFY TEACHER POOL WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A STATE CERTIFICATION AT THE TIME. SO WE WHAT WE PAID FOR WITH SCHOLARSHIPS THESE ARE FULL SCHOLARSHIPS THESE ARE NOT. THIS IS COLLEGE SHIPS WHERE THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO LAY OUT THE MONEY IN ADVANCE -- AND SO THAT THE MONEY WAS WAS -- ADMINISTERED BY A THIRD PARTY AND ED. AND WE ALSO PROVIDED -- RELEASE TIME FOR THE TEACHERS IN OTHER WORDS IF THEY HAD TO TAKE A COURSE DURING THE DAY -- THAT CENTER WOULD GET MONEY FOR A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER. WE WERE WE WERE ALL IN ON THIS. AND AND IT WAS MONEY WELL SPENT BECAUSE NOW WE'RE ELEVATING THE WORK FORCE AND AND AND MAKING THIS A JOB THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD JOB A GOOD QUALITY JOHN. WE ALSO HAD IN PLACE WHICH AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE HAD A POST BACCALAUREATE ALTERNATE ROUTE. CERTIFICATE. SO -- IN FIFTEEN CREDITS VERY CLEARLY DEFINED NOT THE COURSES THEMSELVES BUT THE COMPETENCIES. THAT -- TEACHERS WHO HAD OF ASHER STREET EITHER PUBLIC SCHOOL CLASSROOM OR IN A PRIVATE PROVIDER CLASSROOM. ENROLL IN THIS PROGRAM COMPLETE WITH SUCCESSFULLY WITHIN TWO YEARS AND THEN HAVE A SORT OF TO BE CERTIFIED TO TEACH THEY WOULD GET UP THEY WOULD GET PAID ON THE PAY SCALE BUT IT'LL SLIGHTLY LOWER RATE THAN SOMEONE WHO ALREADY HAD THEIR CERTIFICATION -- WE HAD SOME SIGNING BONUSES THEN THE BEGINNING TO GET PEOPLE TO TO TO TEACH AND THEN BUT THAT THAT WENT AWAY PRETTY QUICKLY AND BUT THE BIGGEST THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING WAS HAVING COMPARABLE SALARIES. THAT THIS ATTRACTED TEACHERS TO THIS -- HE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TAUGHT KINDERGARTEN OR FIRST GRADE IF THEY HAD THE P. THREE CERTIFICATE. WE TO REINSTATE THE CERTIFICATE -- BRING A GONE AWAY. AND SO I COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE EVER NIGHT I MEAN I REMEMBER I WAS A COLLEGE PROFESSOR IN THE TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAM AT THE TIME. AND WE HAD A WEEKEND TO GET HER PROPOSAL TO AND I DID. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO GET THIS ACCOMPLISHED. WE ALSO THOUGH HAD SCARCITY OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION FACULTY. AND AND PARTICULARLY. THE SCARCITY OF THOSE WHO ARE EXPERTS AND HOW TO TEACH PRESCHOOLERS. THEY MIGHT HAVE KNOWN FOR FIRST GRADE BUT THAT'S NOT THE SAME AND SO -- WHAT WE DID WHEN I WENT TO THE STATE WAS AYE FORM THE EARLY LEARNING IMPROVEMENT CONSORTIUM WHICH WAS A HIGHER EDUCATION CONSORTIUM THAT HELPED ME? DEVELOP THE DATA SYSTEM FOR THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT -- SYSTEM THAT WE PUT IN PLACE BUT ALSO. FIVE FORMING THIS NETWORK THEY HELP EACH OTHER UPGRADE THEIR KNOWLEDGE BASE AND AND IN IN IN EARLY CHILDHOOD. OF COURSE WE HAD TO HIRE PEOPLE TO I MEAN COLLEGES HAD HEART PEOPLE. OF THE WE ALSO HAD CENTER DIRECTORS WHO. WHILE THEY MAY HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE DIRECTING THEIR CENTER DID NOT HAVE. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION EXPERTISE -- NOT ALL OF THEM SAYING THERE WERE SOME LIKE THIS AND AND ALSO MANY DID NOT HAVE GOOD ADMINISTRATIVE. EXPERTISE WE FOUND THIS OUT BY EACH OF THEM SUBMITTED AN ANNUAL BUDGET. AND THERE WERE. WAS A LOT OF REMEDIATION THAT HAD TO BE DONE JUST ON HOW TO DO A BUDGET AND AND SOMEWHERE USING THEIR ATM MACHINES I'M. AS THEIR WAY OF USING DOING ED DOING PAYROLL ONE THING IT WAS M.. SET SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT WENT INTO PLACE AND TRAINING AND HELPING THEM GET GET. GET FULLY QUALIFIED AGAIN. NOT ALL SENATOR AFTER SOME OF THEM WERE THE ONES DOING TRAINING -- IT IT IT VERY BUT IT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO WORK ON THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES -- DEVELOP DIRECTORS ACADEMIES TO HELP WITH THIS AND WE A PUT FISCAL SPECIALISTS AND EVERY -- DISTRICT TO HELP. PROVIDE. TRAINING FOR AND GUIDANCE TO THE CENTER DIRECTOR STATES THAT THEY COULD DO THE ADMINISTRATIVE SIDE OF THIS. WE ALSO PUT IN A CENTER DIRECTOR SALARIES GOT HIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE COULDN'T BE RAISING THE TEACHER SALARY AND THEN FORGETTING THE CENTER DIRECTORS. AND THE RIGHT WAY TO MAKE THE MOST MONEY WAS TO HAVE A LARGE CENTER HAVE A MASTER'S DEGREE IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION AND EXPERTISE IN ADMINISTRATION -- WE ALSO MADE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE A VERY SMALL CENTER BECAUSE THE COSTS OF THAT TO FOR TAX THAT THE STATE. OR JUST AT TOO EXPENSIVE TO TO GENERATE THE MONEY FOR CENTER DIRECTOR I CAN TALK MORE ABOUT THAT IF YOU WANT BUT THIS IS WEEDY. SO -- AND EVERYBODY EVERYBODY NEEDED PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THIS DATE THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN PARTICULAR COULD BARELY WORKED WITH YOUNG CHILDREN AT THAT TIME YOU YOU HAVE AN ADVANTAGE HERE WERE SCHOOL DISTRICTS HERE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH YOUNG CHILDREN -- AND WE HAVE SO WE HAD A LOT OF WORK AT THE STATE WE HAD TO DO TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY WAS UP TO STANDARD -- AND THEN IMPORTANTLY. THE STATE AGENCY CAPACITY WAS REALLY IMPORTANT AND I I WILL I WILL. URGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THIS WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT EXPANSION -- DO YOU NEED TO HAVE AN ADEQUATE. INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE STATE AGENCY TO SUPPORT QUALITY. NOT AS IT NOT THE GOTCHA MONITORING KINDS BUT REALLY TO BE A PARTNER. TO THE DISTRICTS AND THE PROVIDERS AND TO HELP THEM. COME IN THERE FOR PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT. AND I ALSO WHEN THEY OFFERED ME THE JOB OF ASSISTANT COMMISSIONER I SAID NOT IF I'M NOT SENIOR STAFF. THE REASON IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF MY EGO ALTHOUGH THAT ALWAYS UNDERSTAND. IT WAS. IT WAS BECAUSE PRESCHOOL WAS NEW. TO TO THIS AGENCY AND NOBODY KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. AND I SAID I HAVE TO BE AT THE TABLE. AND OR THE PERSON IN THIS POSITION HAS TO BE AT THE TABLE SO I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE HOW YOUR CONFIGURED BUT I THINK THAT'S A REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO CONSIDER. IS -- THAT THAT QUESTIONS ARE BEING INFORMED SOMEWHAT BY PROVIDE AN EXPERT AND EARLY CHILDHOOD -- IF YOU TURNED ASIDE SEVEN I JUST WANTED TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- HEY HOW WE FINANCED THE WORK FORCE SIDE OF THIS SHOULD FIRST JUST SAY ALL OF THIS CAME OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND DID NOT COME OUT OF CONTROL FUNDING -- AND IT WAS. A VERY VERY VERY VERY TINY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL BUDGET I DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY NOW BUT IT WAS LESS THAN 1%. OF THE TOTAL GENERAL FUND -- THE BUT THE WAY THAT WE FUNDED THE WORK. FOR BUILDING OF THE WORK FORCE WAS NOT WE DIDN'T DO THIS PLAN FULLY IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT THIS HAPPENS -- AND I'LL TRY TO EXPLAIN IT IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE BUT WHEN UNIVERSAL PRE K. IS FULLY IMPLEMENTED. THE COST PER YEAR IS ABOUT WHAT KICK TWELVE COSTS. AND SO IF YOU THINK OF THAT YOU'RE ADDING A YEAR PUBLIC EDUCATION THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY. I MEAN IF YOU THINK IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL% AND I MEAN THIS IS JUST A WAY TO THINK ABOUT THIS -- BUT IN START UP YEARS IS NOT A COST THAT MUCH. BECAUSE TEACHERS ARE GOING TO BE FULLY QUALIFIED THEY'RE NOT IN BECOMING SAID AT THAT LEVEL YOU YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE JUST AREN'T GOING TO HAVE THAT MANY COSTS BUT SO THAT. IF YOU STILL THINK ABOUT THE FULL COST. SOME OF THAT CAN BEAT CAN BE DEVOTED -- TO SUPPORTING TEACHERS IN GETTING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE SO EASY YOU JUST HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE COSTS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY AND LAYER THEM DIFFERENTLY IN OVERTIME BECAUSE MORE AND MORE INTO SALARIES AND LESS AND LESS AND LESS INTO. PREPARING PEOPLE. HAD I DO KATIE WAS THAT CLOSE. CAPE HELP ME PRACTICE THAT I THINK -- AND I WANT TO SAY WE HAD A 2% SET ASIDE FOR ARE ALL FROM MY OFFICE. OUT OF THE FOR TOTAL BUDGET AND SET IT. SO THAT WE COULD FIND RESEARCH AND AND ADD TRY TO DO EXPERIMENTS WE DIDN'T EXPERIMENT OF LOOKING AT LONGER DAY VERSUS SHORTER DAY WE DIDN'T AT DO A LANGUAGE. SO WE TRIED TO THE QUESTIONS THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE GOOD ANSWERS FOR WE HAVE A NOW FOR YOU SO YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT BUT IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS THAT COME UP YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD ANSWERS FOR RATHER THAN WHOLESALE DOING ACROSS THE WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TRY IT OUT A COUPLE PLACES BEFORE YOU. BUTTE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T RIGHT THE SHIP IS REALLY HARD TO WRITE ONCE IT ONCE IT'S ONCE IT'S IN PLACE. AND THEN THE THE NEXT SIDE. TALKS A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OTHER CRITICAL DECISIONS AND I'VE HEARD YOU TALK ABOUT SOME OF ALREADY SO IT WON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON BUT YOU WERE JUST TRYING TO THE GOVERNANCE ISSUE -- AND ALSO ADMINISTRATION DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS ALL HOUSING ONE AGENCY DO YOU MAY ADMINISTER CLOSER TO THE GROUND AND A MORE LOCAL LOCAL WAY -- OBVIOUSLY WHAT WHAT PROGRAMS ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE PART OF THIS IS A DECISION THAT HAS TO BE MADE -- AND THEN HOW DO YOU DISTRIBUTE THE FUNDS ARE THEY IS A COMPETITIVE AS IT DIRECTOR PROGRAM OR DO YOU HAVE SOME INTERMEDIARY AND OUR CASE IT WAS A SCHOOL DISTRICT WAS THE INTERMEDIARY -- INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ARE. FACILITIES AN INTEGRATED DATA SYSTEMS YOU YEAH YOU CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN TO YOU CAN INSURANCE CAN BE HIGH QUALITY IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT THAT THOSE -- AND THEN -- WE ARE TO TALK ABOUT THE PROGRAM THE PROGRAM COMPONENTS -- BUT I ANOTHER THING THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT WE'RE SEEING IN NEW JERSEY. AS YOU HAVE TO BUILDING MECHANISMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY AND NOT JUST OF THE FUNDING BUT OF A QUALITY. THAT WE WE HAVE I CAN POINT YOU TO A COUPLE OF STATES WERE QUALITY HAS BEEN ERODING IN NEW JERSEY IS ONE OF THEM AND IT'S VERY CONCERNING. AND SO THINKING ABOUT HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT YOU BILLS HERE IT IS IS STILL HERE IN TWENTY YEARS. AND THEN I HAVE TO EXAMPLES FROM OTHER STATES AND I'M NOT SURE WHETHER YOU ALL ARE GETTING TIRED OF HEARING ME OR I SHOULD KEEP GOING. OKAY. OKAY -- THE I JUST WANTED. TO TO REDUCE THE CHAIRMAN MCCARTY TALKED ABOUT TO A TO READ STATES IN ALABAMA NORTH CAROLINA ARE GOOD EXAMPLES OF THIS THERE. THEY ARE LEADERS IN AND PRE K. NORTH CAROLINA -- AND AN EARLY LEADER IN ALABAMA I'M MORE RECENT -- ONE OUT I LOVE ELEMENT IN THE NAME OF ALLAH CLASS. FIRST CLASS FREE K.. F. -- AND THE THINGS THAT ARE INTERESTING ABOUT ALL OF THEM I WILL FIRST OF ALL IF IT MEETS ALL OF THE TEN BENCHMARKS AND HAS A VERY STRONG ENABLING ENVIRONMENT. IT IS GOVERNED OUT OF A STANDALONE EARLY LEARNING DEPARTMENT. AT A SECOND IT HAS A SECRETARY LEVEL APPOINT LEAD. AND I THINK THAT CAUSES PROBLEMS IN TERMS OF THE CAGE WALL CONTINUITY BUT IT ALSO. IT MAKES THINGS EASIER ACROSS THE WHOLE SPECTRUM -- ZERO TO FIVE AND THEY THEY USE A COMPETITIVE GRANT NEXT DELIVERY SYSTEM SO THEY HAVE TO THAT MEANS THAT THE THAT THEY ARE DEPARTMENT HAS. TO APPROVE EVERY GRANT THAT COMES IN FOR A PRE K. PROGRAM -- SO THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS YOU HAVE TO WEIGH IN IN IN THINKING ABOUT IT. THEY'VE HAD REALLY RAPID EXPANSION FROM 6% OF THEIR FOUR YEAR OLDS 224% IN LESS THAN FIVE YEARS AND THEY AVE ALL THEY HAVE A PLANNED EXPANSION I THINK THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL THEY THEY'RE THINKING ABOUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO SCALE. THIS FOR FOR ALL KIDS ARE LONE CAM K?T IT'S IT'S STARTING LOW INCOME BUT IT WILL BE UNIVERSAL AND I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER THING IN WHICH CHILDREN ARE YOU GONNA. IN NEW JERSEY WE ARE EXPANSION HAS WORKED WITH FIRST THESE LOW INCOME SMALLER DISTRICTS IT WAS UNIVERSAL WITHIN THOSE DISTRICTS YOU COULD BE A WEALTHY. FAMILY IN YOUR CHILD IS STILL GOING TO ELIGIBLE BECAUSE PUBLIC SCHOOL. AND THE WE'RE EXPANDING NOW IT TO THE NEXT. NEXT HERE OF DISTRICTS SAID THERE'D LESS LOW INCOME DISTRICTS BUT THEY'RE STILL HAVE A HIGH PROPORTION OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES -- AND SO THAT'S ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT TEARING THIS SO THAT YOU'RE SO YOU'RE MEETING THE NEEDIEST FIRST BUT KNOWING THAT PRE K. AS IT -- IS BENEFICIAL TO ALL. SO IT AND AND ALSO THERE'S OTHER REASONS WE WE HAVE SOME SOME. HENCE THAT A CRITICAL MASS COMING INTO KINDERGARTEN MATTERS SO IF YOU'RE ONLY SERVING LOW INCOME CHILDREN. WHO HAVE HAD THIS PROGRAM -- YOU THE KINDERGARTEN DOESN'T MISS WHAT AND THEN THAT MAY BE ONE REASON WE'RE NOT SING PROGRAMS -- SO -- ALABAMA SOUND EFFECTS INTO. ENTER THE SCHOOL GRADES NORTH CAROLINA IS A MUCH LONGER STANDING PROGRAM IT'S BEGINNING IS ONE OF THE STATES THAT PROGRAMS IT'S GETTING ERODED. AND IT WAS PART OF JIM HUNTS HOLD EDUCATION APPROACH WERE HAD A CHILDREN'S CABINET AND THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF EMPHASIS ON HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION AND NOW NORTH CAROLINA AT THE TIME. THEY ALSO EXCEEDED THEM NEAR TEN BENCHMARKS THEY HAVE. THAT THE TEACH PROGRAM WHICH IS A REALLY INTERESTING WAY OF A PROVIDING SCHOLARSHIP AND SUPPORTED TEACHERS AS THEY GO BACK TO SCHOOL WAS FOUNDED IN NORTH CAROLINA AND ACTUALLY CREATED BY THE STATE THERE. BUT IS NOW BEING USED IN TWENTY OTHER STATES -- YOUR WAGES PROGRAM THAT YOU'VE USED IS ALSO ONE THAT CAME OUT OF NORTH CAROLINA AND THE VISION AND SOME LOCATIONS -- THEY HAVE PAYING ENHANCEMENT. OUTSIDE OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL CLASSROOMS BUT NOT PAY PARITY. AT EVENT THEY ALSO HAVE AFFECTS INTO THE SCHOOL GRADES. SO I'M HAPPY. TO TO TALK MORE ABOUT OTHER STATES BUT LET ME JUST MAKE A FEW CONCLUSION. INCLUSIONS WE KNOW THAT MANY PRESCHOOL FUNDS ARE NOT DELIVERING. THE DESIRED RESULTS. AND WE THINK AN ADEQUATE. AND ADEQUATELY PREPARED TEACHERS IS LIKELY ONE OF THOSE REASONS -- BUT AGAIN NO SINGLE INGREDIENT. I'M. THE ONE THING WE DO KNOW IS THAT ONLY PRO HIGHLY EDUCATED WELL PAID TEACHERS [inaudible] HAVE. ON AFFECTS THAT ARE LASTING. WHEN WE LOOK ACROSS ALL THE BODY OF RESEARCH THAT ONCE THAT THAT SHOW THAT HAD TEACHERS LIKE THAT THEN THAT'S? THAT'S THE AND SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT AND COMPELLING REASON THE OTHER IS. THAT. THIS THEN BUILT A WORKFORCE THAT IS WELL PAID AND AND AND IS A GOOD AT AND AND IT HELPS THE COMMUNITY IN GENERAL THE IT'S NOT SUFFICIENT. AND ALL KINDS OF WORKING CONDITIONS ARE IMPORTANT IN ADDITION TO THE PAY. BUT ALL THE OTHER PROGRAM. COMPONENTS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT NEED. ALSO NEED TO BE IN PLACE. AND FINALLY JUST TO SHOW THAT I'M. AN EDUCATED UNIVERSITY PERSON I HAD TO HAVE A LITERARY QUOTE FOR YOU. FROM EVER IN EBENEZER SCROOGE WHICH FALLS IN THAT LITTLE KIDS AND TAYLOR. OKAY THANK YOU. QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS FROM THE NUMBER OF CARS. AT THE END THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IT'S IS IT FREED DOT THREE PRETTY DOCTOR PRETTY WELL FIRST OF ALL AB. BE ELECTED PERSONNEL GOING ON MY LIMóN TO ARE NEVER SEEN ANYONE USE EBENEZER SCROOGE QUOTE IN A PRESENTATION AND IT WORKS. RESOLUTIONS -- AND YOU KNOW WHAT. ALTHOUGH YOU INDICATE THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF INGREDIENTS THAT. INDICATE -- DEGREES SUCCESS ONE IN THAT BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE AND I MEAN OFTENTIMES TALK ABOUT. EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION -- PRE K. AND PEOPLE THINK THAT IT'S A GLORIFIED BABY TEACHER A BABY HAVE BABYSITTERS -- WE KNOW THAT'S NOT THE CASE AND I THINK THAT YOU KIND OF REITERATE THAT THREE EUROPORT -- AND AND SO ALL THE AND AND ENTER INTO THIS TO THE THE STANDARDS ARE METRICS ARE. ALL IMPORTANT BUT IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO KIND BEST IN PEOPLE. AND AND WHICH CERTAINLY COSTS MONEY. BUT YOU HAVE BEEN DOING A PROGRAM OF THIS NATURE AND NOT. PUTTING THAT INVESTMENT UP FRONT YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE AS AS YOU INDICATE TO REPORT THE RESULTS THAT WE ARE DESIRING YOU'LL JUST. HAVE A PROGRAM AND IT'S NOT IT'S JUST GOING TO BECOME. GLORIFIED BABYSITTERS RATHER THAN THE ACTUAL EDUCATORS THAT WE NEED AT THAT EARLY LEVEL. AND I LOOK AT YOUR REFERENCES SO YOU SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO LOOK AT THE END OF THE OTHER FREE. I LOOK TO THE REFERENCES AND SEE THAT YOU'VE WRITTEN A COUPLE OF PAPERS. ABOUT THE LONG TERM EFFECTS. OF THE BRISTOL PRESCHOOL AND WHAT HAVE YOU. AND LOOKING AT LOOKS LIKE LOOKING AT NEW JERSEY CAN WE HAS IT OVER THE IN IN THESE REPORTS THAT YOU'VE DONE. IS THERE A CO QUANTIFICATION EITHER MONEY OR OTHER IN OTHER RESOURCES AS TO WHAT. THE STATE SAVES MAY BE A REDUCTION ACROSS RACIAL RATES MAY BE ABOUT -- TO APE. OF EMPLOYABLE. GRADUATES COMING OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE IS YOUR INCREASING YOUR TAX BASE. OF IT CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT AND AND SAY IT SEE IF THERE IS DATA OR IF NOT IF THERE WE CAN EXPECT DATA SINCE THESE PROGRAMS ARE GETTING TO A POINT WHERE. THOSE LITTLE DOLLARS NOW ARE YOU ENTERING THE WORK FORCE ONE IDEA. THEN THEY'RE NOT QUITE THE ALMOST IRVINE HIGH SCHOOL OF THE CULVERT WERE STUDYING M. IS IN HIGH SCHOOL OKAY AND WE'RE WE JUST GOT FUNDING TO LOOK AT THAT THEM. FURTHER ON AND AND MUCH TO MY DISMAY. ISN'T IT AND IS ALSO AN ECONOMIST HAS NOT DONE THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS YET. SO HE IS THE WAS THE INITIAL ECONOMIST ON THE PERRY PRESCHOOL STUDY AS WELL AS ON APPOSITE DERIAN STUDY -- BUT THE REASON THAT HE HASN'T IS BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE DATA. THAT TO TO TO DO WE COULD DO SOME VERY VERY FUZZY. THE KIND OF THING ECONOMIST TO A WHOLE LOT OF OF YET PREDICTING WHAT WHAT MIGHT BE THE EFFECTS BUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WAIT A LITTLE BIT AND AND WE'RE SO LITTLE UNDER FIND IT SO IF ANY OF THE ONE OF THE FIRST SHIP SOME. CALIFORNIA DOLLARS TO US TO FUND THIS WEEKEND. WILL BE BETTER BUT I THINK THE THING WE KNOW IS THAT THE SAVINGS COME FROM THREE TENSION. THAT THAT CRIME AND DELINQUENCY EAT MOST MOST OF THE SAVINGS FROM THAT COME IN ADULTHOOD BUT SOME COME IN IN HIGH SCHOOL -- AND THEN THE TAXPAYER OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE TO GET INTO THE WORK FORCE BEFORE WE CAN. AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO STUDY THIS COHORT THAT WELL -- TECH BUT WE CAN BEGIN AT LEAST WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE DATA I THINK THEY'LL BE VERY HELPFUL IN PARTICULAR IN A COUPLE YEARS WHEN THEY DO INTO THE WORK FORCE YOU CAN SEE HOW MANY WERE. DROP OUTS HOW HOW MANY MADE UNFORTUNATE COME ADDRESSES SOME VERSES. ARE COMPATIBLE POPULATIONS THAT DON'T HAVE THAT REALLY CHALLENGE CASE BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THE QUESTIONS ALWAYS GONNA COME UP AS ARTICLE A COUPLE TIMES OF THE COST. AND SO WE CAN SAY YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS ACTUALLY A SAVE US A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY EVEN PUTTING TEACHERS GOING IN THE COLLEGE DEGREE IS MAKE SURE THEY'RE CERTIFIED. YES THAT COST A LOT UP FRONT BUT IT WILL SAVE US A WHOLE LOT MORE LATER ON AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE. THE THOROUGHNESS OF YOUR OF YOUR REPORT AND THE WORK YOU'RE DOING SO THANK YOU. OKAY. THANK YOU BEFORE I GET -- TO SO MEMBERS MET I JUST WANNA KNOW DOT ON YOUR POINT IS THAT INTUITIVELY WE KNOW IT'S IT'S A GOOD INVESTMENT BUT BUT MAYBE NOT -- NEW JERSEY BUT THE LANDMARK PERRY STUDIES SHOW THAT KIDS WHO WENT TO HIGH RATES I THINK -- INCREASE BY ABOUT 50% AND THEIR INCARCERATION RATES IN JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM DECREASED BY ABOUT A THIRD. AND YOU KNOW TO AN OLD JUVENILE HALL LA COUNTY IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE GRAND A YEAR. PER KID. AND YOU KNOW I KNEW REPORTED SAYS WE SPEND ROUGHLY SIX THOUSAND ENOUGH FOR STATE PRESCHOOL PART DATES WHEN LASSEN THAT FILLED A BIT MORE. BUT THINK HOW MANY. LET'S LET'S JUST SAY AVERAGE THAT SIX THOUSAND LET LET'S SAY WE WANT TO GO OUT. TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE COST OF TEN DOLLARS OR SHOULD BE. YET YACHTS THATTWENTY FIVE KIDS IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN IN LA COUNTY SO SO THINK OF IT THAT WAY. YEAH ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND PICKING UP ON THAT CONCEPT TO THE MEMBERS WHO APPROACHED IT I MEAN I JUST KNOW ANECDOTALLY TO HAVE HAVING RECENTLY SERVED ON A LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD. THERE ARE DEFINITELY SAVINGS TO BE GARNERED IN THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM WITH WHAT WE DON'T END UP SPENDING ON RESOURCE SPECIALIST IN READING AND MATHEMATICS AND IN SPEECH PATHOLOGY BECAUSE WE'VE DONE THAT WORK AT THE PRE SCHOOL LEVEL -- IT WHEN WE HAVE A GOOD COMPREHENSIVE A PRESCHOOL AVAILABLE DOCTOR FREE I PARTICULARLY -- APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AROUND HAVING STANDARDS BASED CURRICULUM AND AS WELL AS SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN'S I'D NOT THAT THIS REALLY FOR US IS ABOUT ELIMINATING. THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND FOR I THINK TO CONFLATED THE CONCEPT OF CHILD CARE WHICH IS NOBLE AND WORTHY IN ITS OWN RIGHT AND HAVING I'M PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE CHILDREN IN A CHILD CARE SETTING THAT IS SAFE FOR THEM BUT WE'RE GONNA ACHIEVE THIS NEXT LEVEL -- OF EQUITY AND OF SUCCESS IN A UNIVERSAL -- A PRE K. ENVIRONMENT IT REALLY DOES NEED TO BE STANDARDS -- BASED AND AND FOCUSED ON ON ELIMINATING THAT ACHIEVEMENT GAP AND IT A BIG PIECE OF THAT REALLY THEN DOES GO TO THE QUALITY OF INSTRUCTION THAT'S OFFERED IN THE CLASSROOM THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND AT YOU KNOW I BY BIG THE COMMITTEES PARDON THAT THIS SOUNDS A BIT. OF A HUMBLE BRAG BUT I HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO'S A LIBERAL STUDIES MAJOR TEST YES YOU -- DURING HER TIME THERE SHE IS IN A PRESCHOOL CLASSROOM AND THE ON SITE CHILD DEVELOPMENT CENTER LOVES THE WORK WOULD ABSOLUTELY LOVE TO STAY IN PRESCHOOL TEACHING. SHE'S PURSUING A LIBERAL STUDIES DEGREE WITH A SPECIALIZATION IN MATHEMATICS AND A MINOR IN CULTURAL PROFICIENCY SHE WOULD BE AN IDEAL TEACHER TO BE IN THIS KIND OF ENVIRONMENT BUT SHE KNOWS SHE CAN'T AFFORD TO SUPPORT HERSELF ON A PRESCHOOL TEACHER SALARY. SO HOW DO WE CONTINUE -- TO EMPOWER THIS WORK FORCE IN CALIFORNIA IN OTHER CREATIVE WAYS AND I'M SPECIFICALLY MY QUESTION IS THE COMMISSION ON TEACHER CREDENTIALING AND THE SPEAKERS BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION. HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT REQUIRING INCREASED COMPETENCIES FOR THE EARLY EDUCATION TEACHER WORK FORCE MEANING THAT WE FOCUS MORE ON HOW CONCEPTS ARE APPLIED TO IMPROVE TEACHING INSTEAD OF JUST FOCUSING ON THE UNITS TAKEN -- HAS THIS BEEN DONE IN OTHER STATES ARE THEIR SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS THAT DON'T REQUIRE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE BUT HAVE HIGH QUALITY BENCHMARKS AND OUTCOMES. SO. I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER STATES THAT USE A COMPETENCY BASED -- SYSTEM THAT WE LOOK FIRST ABOUT THE SYSTEM IN NEW JERSEY. I AN ULTIMATE AND I KNOW THAT A COUPLE OF OTHER STATES DID AS WELL WE WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WOULD COST AS MUCH AND BE SUCH A CUMBERSOME BUREAUCRACY. THAT IT IT JUST WASN'T. AT WHICH IT WE ARE. ALSO WANTED THIS TO BE SEEN AS IT BECAUSE IT WAS PUBLIC EDUCATION -- AND SO WHY SHOULD THE STANDARDS AND AND MAKE IT DOESN'T SPEAK DIFFERENT THE DIFFERENT SHOULD BE THAT THE TEACHERS ARE PREPARED FOR THIS AGE LEVEL. AND FOR TEACHING WELL IN THE SENSE LEVEL BUT WE WE REALLY WE WE STRUGGLE WITH THAT I WILL SAY THERE ARE OTHER PLATE PLACES TRYING TO COME UP WITH THAT -- PHILADELPHIA RIGHT NOW IS LOOKING AT THIS FOR THEIR CITY FUNDED PRESCHOOL PROGRAM -- AND I AND I KNOW THAT SEATTLE M. IS LOOKING AT AN APPLIED VA -- WHICH WOULD DOES NOT COME WITH THE CERTIFICATION -- BUT I HAVE NOT I DON'T KNOW THAT I NONE OF THEM HAVE ANY. BENEFITS TO SHOW FROM IT YET BECAUSE THEY THEY HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN DONE THEY'RE JUST CONSIDERING IN AND AND I THINK IT'S IT'S A IT'S I I CERTAINLY THINK THAT IT THAT HAVING I I NEGLECTED TO TELL YOU THAT WE WE TOOK SIX YEARS TO GET THERE. THAT I NEGLECTED. SORRY IT WAS IN MY NOTES. BUT THE THE COURT ALLOWED. A FOUR YEAR WINDOW. FORGET THE CURRENT WORK FORCE TO GET THEIR DEGREE -- DURING THAT TIME THEIR THEIR SALARIES NOT IN ANY KIND OF REGULATED WAY BUT WERE AND IMPROVED. BUT THEY COULDN'T GET THE FULL SALARY TILL THEY GOT THE FULL QUALIFICATION. F. THREE YEARS AND WE SAW TEACHERS WERE WORKING HARD TOWARD THIS BUT WEREN'T GOING TO GET IT AND AND AND FOR YEARS SO WE WENT BACK TO THE COURT THE STATE. WENT WITH THE PLAINTIFFS TO THE COURT WHICH WAS THE ONLY TIME AN EVENT THAT HAPPENED AND TWICE -- AND ASK THE COURT TO ALLOW US TO MORE YEARS SO THE TEACHERS WHO ARE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS AT THE THREE YEAR MARK WERE BY THEN IT WAS NOW THE FOR YOUR MARK -- AT HAD TWO MORE YEARS TO COMPLETE THEIR DEGREES I THINK TAKING. TIME IS IMPORTANT -- BUT BUT HAVE INCENTIVES BUILT IN ALONG THE WAY. IT THAT THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN A NUMBER OF STATES. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THEM RESPECT. A GOOD STRATEGY THANK YOU. DOCTOR PRETTY -- I'M LOOKING AT YOUR SLIDE NUMBER FIVE AND THE ONE THAT HAS WAY TOO MANY GRASSROOTS WELL. I AM. NOT NOT TOO BAD BUT I I ESPECIALLY I'M INTERESTED IN -- THE REDUCTION IN THE SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS -- FROM THE INVESTMENT IN IN PRESCHOOL ARE THIS 5% DROP. IN SPECIAL AS A SAID IN MY READING THAT GRAPH RIGHT THAT IT'S A 5% DROP IN -- IN A SPECIAL EDUCATION COSTS NOT COST PLACE. PLACEMENT OKAY YES SIR SO -- CHILDREN WHO DID NOT ATTEND ABBOTT PRE K. WERE 17% OF THEM WERE. WERE PLACED IN SPECIAL EDUCATION. M. AS OPPOSED 212% OF CHILDREN WHO DID ATTEND. AT THAT PRICE TICKET PROGRAM DO YOU KNOW LIKE -- AT THIS TIME. WHAT THE PERCENTAGE? OF COST SAVING ONCE BUT WE WERE WE'RE TALKING THAT I IT IT IT DEPENDS A LOT ON THE CLASSIFICATION SO WE'D HAVE TO EACH INDIVIDUAL CLASSIFICATION I WE COULD DO A KIND OF GENERAL ESTIMATE. THAT I AM I'M SORRY I THAT'S NOT MY FIELD AND I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE PER PEOPLE COSTS ITS MISSION THAT IS ACROSS THE BOARD. THESE ARE PROBABLY THE CHILDREN KNOW WHO -- HAD. A MORE MINOR IF THE COST OF THEIR SPECIAL EDUCATION WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS EXPENSIVE THESE ARE NOT PROFOUNDLY IMPAIRED AND AT STUDENTS. A AND AND AND SO THAT THE ONES RIGHT ON THE ON THE EDGE OF EITHER BEING PLACED IN SPECIAL ED OR NOT AND WHERE THIS THEN ENDED UP BEING AMELIORATIVE FOR THEM AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT TO SAY. YEAH I NINE SIR AG PROBABLY FOCUSED ON AND THE MATERIAL THAT I MISTER QUESTION -- YOU KNOW. IT SEEMS THAT THE I AM HEARING I A COMMON THEME THAT WE OFTEN HEAR AN EDUCATION WHICH IS THAT THE THE MOST IMPORTANT -- WAY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. IN THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION IS TO GET THE BEST TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM. AND AND YET WE IN -- IN AND CALIFORNIA AND I SUSPECT THE NOW IN NEW JERSEY -- WILL YOU KNOW WE ARE FACING A TEACHER SHORTAGE -- AND AND SO I YOU FOR SPECIFIED SEVERAL TIMES IN YOUR PRESENTATION THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING A YOU KNOW FINANCIAL INCENTIVES COMPARABLE SALARIES SCHOLARSHIP SIGNING BONUSES -- YEAH THIS IS A AND SO AMENABLE ARE ARE ARE THOSE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO TO ATTRACTED TEACHERS INTO THE THE THE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION -- SPACE WELL I THINK. I THINK IT'S A HARDER ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S CERTAINLY NOT JUST AT THIS HOUR IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THE WORKING CONDITIONS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT. THE IN OTHER WORDS THAT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE HAVE SOME A TIME TO BE IN YOUR IN YOUR WORK IN YOU AND YOU AND ENJOY THE PP WORK LESS THAN THAT YOU HAVE ALL THAT SUPPORTS THAT YOU NEED YOU THAT YOU GET -- PAID TIME OFF AND THAT ALL THOSE THINGS ARE IMPORTANT AND THAT YOU ARE GETTING GOOD PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND WHEN YOU HAVE A PROBLEM THERE'S SOMEONE THERE WHO CAN HELP YOU HELP SUPPORT YOU TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM -- DOES IT THOSE ARE ALL IMPORTANT CONDITIONS THAT IN THAT SENSE OF INITIALLY ATTRACTING I'M I'M NOT THAT'S MAJOR AREA OF EXPERTISE BUT I WOULD SAY -- IF WE COULD GET A BETTER. IF THE PUBLIC WE HAD A BETTER PERCEPTION OF TEACHERS AND TEACHING IN GENERAL LIKE THEY DID WHEN I WAS COMING UP. I MEAN THAT WAS A NOBLE PROFESSION THAT WAS VERY WELL RESPECTED AND I DON'T THINK IT ISN'T AS MUCH ANYMORE AND I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN SOLVE WITH LEGISLATION -- BUT I SO YOUADD TO THAT THAT IT'S THE POORLY PAID. AND IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO TO ATTRACT OKAY. I WISH I COULD ANSWER THAT FOR YOU KNOW I I I I AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY EVERYONE DOESN'T WANT TO BE A PRESCHOOL TEACHER AT IN. SORRY MIGHT MY LAST QUESTION FOR NOW IS -- YOU YOU HEARD DOUG -- MISTER DONALD STRODE OFF THE HIS PRESENTATION BY TALKING ABOUT HOW. YOU KNOW WE WE WE LOVE PRE K. BUT WE DO WANT TO SPEND OUR PROP NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS ON IT -- AND IN AYE AYE AYE. TO COMES OUT OF YOU KNOW A MEASURE OF CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE FACING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHERE YOU KNOW IT'S BECOMING INCREASINGLY -- A A A FACT THAT IS BEING FOCUSED ON THAT CALIFORNIA DEPENDING ON WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO IS FORTY FIRST IN THE NATION IN PER PUPIL SPENDING SO WHEN WE ARE READY. YOU KNOW -- IN THE BOTTOM FIFTH IN THE NATION IN PER PEOPLE SPENDING AND AND AND AND YET WE RECOGNIZE ALL THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT. TO ABOUT PRE K. -- AND SO YOU KNOW I I KNOW. IT'S OUR JOB TO TRY. TO BALANCE ALL THE PRIORITIES GIVEN THE THE THE LIMITED DOLLARS BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS AS TO YOU KNOW HOW WE ANY ADVICE ON AND HOW WE WE WE CAN STRIKE THAT BALANCE I COULD MAKE IT WORSE FOR YOU BY SAYING THAT YOU REALLY SHOULD BE WORKING ON THE WHOLE. BIRTH TO FIVE SYSTEM AS WELL THAT. BUT I I I DON'T LIKE. AND I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE BEING PUT IN THE POSITION OF A YOU KNOW SOPHIE'S CHOICE FOR YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE AMONG YOUR CHILDREN. AND AND I I SO I I CERTAINLY AM AM SYMPATHETIC TO TO THE POSITION -- AND I JUST I GUESS I WOULD GO BACK -- TO SOME WOMEN MCCARTY'S POINT ABOUT THE POTENTIAL SAVINGS AND IS A CHILDREN'S LIVES AND HOW DO YOU. HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU MAKE THAT CHOICE NOT TO INVEST IN THEM AND? AND I YOU KNOW I CAN'T BEGIN I HAVE NO EXPERTISE ON CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET OR HOW YOU SPEND YOUR MONEY AND SO I I CAN'T LIKE I I WOULDN'T BE OF MUCH USE AND THERE IT'S NOT. THERE'S NOT SOME SIMPLE ANSWER IN TERMS OF YOU CAN MANUFACTURE IT SOMEHOW IT'S IT IN NEW JERSEY WE JUST TOOK IT OUT OF THE BUDGET. AND IT WAS YEAH. WE WE ALSO WERE HAVING LOTS OF TROUBLE. I WISH I COULD. HAVE I WISH I HAD THAT PRINTING MACHINE FOR YOU. WELL YOU KNOW THAT'S THE THE THREE BILLION DOLLAR QUESTION AND YOU KNOW WE SERVE ON THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE GATHER SO WE'LL HAVE. TO TO ADDRESS THAT AND I KNOW THE GOVERNOR HAS TALKED ABOUT FULLY EMBRACING THIS IN TRYING. TO IDENTIFY NEW REVENUE SOURCES FOR IT AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WE WE THAT NEW REVENUE SOURCES PLUS AS YOU SAID FOR OUR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS THAT. YOU KNOW THESE PROGRAMS ARE K. TWELVE SCHOOLS YOU KNOW T. K. PROGRAMS ARE IN THE PUBLIC FUNDED PROP NINETY EIGHT STATE PRESCHOOL. AND THE NOT ONLY A STATE PRESCHOOL PART DAYS IS -- HIS PROP NINETY EIGHT SO. IT IT'S IT'S THERE AND IT HAS A BIG IMPACT ON SERVING OUR KIDS AND OUR AND OUR FAMILIES TODAY -- BUT BUT YEAH THAT IS THE ISSUE THAT -- WE WANT ABOUT. WE WENT ABOUT WE DON'T TO MAKE THAT THAT CHOICE OF ONE OR I DIDN'T WANT TO GET BACK TO TO SPECIFIC ISSUES. A KIND OF FOLLOW UP ON SOMEONE MEMBERS MISS -- QUESTION ON THE ON THE WORK FORCE SAID. YEAH YOU KNOW -- PEOPLE WHO DO THIS WORK -- YOU KNOW THEY DON'T DO IT FOR THE GREAT PAY YOU KNOW THEY CAN GO WORK AT COSTCO LITERALLY AND WAKE WAY MORE MONEY THAN. THE NON LEE TEACHER FOR A STATE PRESCHOOL EVEN A LEAD TEACHER CAN SOMETIMES WORK IN RETAIL AND WAKE -- MAKE WAY MORE MONEY AS THEY DO IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY CARE. AND IT'S HARD -- TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO TO THE WORK FORCE. AND EVEN GET A BA WHEN THEY'RE SO FAR BELOW. WHAT A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER MAKES AND SO IF YOUR DAUGHTER GOES AND GETS TO BE A BECOMES A PRESCHOOL TEACHER? AND YOU CAN MAKE YOU KNOW TWENTY THOUSAND OR MORE -- TWICE AS OURS DOLLARS -- MORE BEING A KINDERGARTEN TEACHER AND YOU LOOKING AT OUR HOUSING COSTS IN CALIFORNIA PAYING FOR YOUR YOUR OWN KIDS PRESCHOOL. YOU KNOW WHY WOULD WE DO THAT SO I REALIZED. IT'S WORKFORCE PREPARATION AND ADEQUATE PAIN YOU KNOW WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS THAT IN OUR PROPOSAL NOT TALK ABOUT HERE TODAY PER SE AND WE LEARNED THAT FROM VISITING THESE COSTS AND AND THE NEW JERSEY THINK. I DO WANT TO ASK THEM SPECIFIC THING ON THE CREDENTIALS PIECE AND THE TRAINING BECAUSE I REALIZE THAT EITHER QUALITY ELEMENTS. THAT IS KEY IS HAVING THAT. THE ADEQUATELY TRAINED WORKFORCE AND THE WHOLE ISSUE WOULD THAT BE A AND SO FORTH -- I'M KIND OF AT A LOSS TO SORT OF GET HELP ME WITH THIS BECAUSE I CAN I CAN SEE HYPOTHETICAL OF A OF AN INDIVIDUAL. GETTING A BE A IN SOCIOLOGY. AND REALLY NEVER TAKING A LOT OF EARLY AD COURSES BUT YOU HAVE A BA. AND YOU CAN BE PERCENT AA THAT GOES TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE WHO GETS IN A WOULD LET'S SAY TWENTY FOUR UNITS IN A SPECIALTY. IN EARLY EDUCATION AND LET'S SAY HALF OF THOSE UNITS. ARE LIKE A PRACTICUM WHERE YOUR YOU KNOW IN EXTERNSHIP YOUR IN. A CLASSROOM AND SO THOSE TWO PEOPLE IN YOUR EYES OR IN THE EYES OF RESEARCHERS WHO HAS MORE VALUE. IN SERVING LITTLE THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS SOMEONE WHO HAS THE FOUR YEAR DEGREE IN SOCIOLOGY WITH MINIMAL. PRE K. -- EDUCATION OF THE PERSON WHICH IS THE TIME. FOCUSING ON EARLY EDUCATION ACADEMIA I CAN'T ANSWER THAT -- THE RESEARCH CAN ANSWER YEAH WHAT WHAT WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WOULD YOU THINK WELL. WHERE WOULD YOU PUT YOUR MIND? WHERE WOULD YOU PUT YOUR LITTLE KIDS -- WELL IT DEPENDS ON WHAT OTHER SUPPORT TODAY ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL OKAY TO TEACHERS TO CLASSROOMS SOMEONE FAIR. THE BUT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT I RECOMMEND. EITHER OF THAT THE I'M I'M RECOMMENDING A BACHELOR'S DEGREE WITH CERTIFICATION SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF THOSE TWO THINGS NOT THE STATE'S DON'T HAVE. THE BACHELORS WITH THE CERTIFICATION -- WELL I DON'T KNOW THEN I WOULD I WOULD DO AN EXPERIMENT YEAH HE DID AN EXPERIMENT YEAH. I BECAUSE I I THERE ISN'T THERE ISN'T A RIGHT ANSWER TO THAT YEAH I KNOW THAT HEAD START. HAS HAS THAT AND THEY'RE FACING SOME CHALLENGES IN IN IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE THAT THAT THE PAY AND THEY LOSE OUR TEACHERS RIGHT AWAY YOU'LL GET A BE A AND THEN YOU HAVE. TWENTY GRAND THE AVERAGE CSU STUDENT AS NORTH OF TWENTY GRAND IN DEBT. AND YOU GO BE A LEAD PRESCHOOL TEACHER. AND YOUR SALARY UNLESS SOMEONE IS A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME GETTING A TEACHING CREDIT YEAH HE'S GOT ROCKET UP EVEN MORE I WORK FOR FOUR YEARS FOR LARGE HEAD START GRANT TO THAT. OPERATED IN FOR STATE SO I KNOW THAT. SCENARIO REALLY WELL -- ESPECIALLY WHEN THE STATE PRE K. PROGRAM DECIDED THEY WERE GOING TO EXPAND SO THEY REDUCE THEIR REQUIREMENTS AND I AT LEAST KNEW THAT MIKE VALLEY WELL PREPARED TEACHERS THAT I WOULD WORK SO HARD WITH. WERE MOVING. WERE STILL TEACHING LITTLE KIDS -- WHEN THEY JUMP SHIP BUT -- I I I DON'T KNOW I WOULD LOVE TO DO AN EXPERIMENT OF A HIGH QUALITY A VERSES A HIGH QUALITY BA NOT A HIGH QUALITY A PERSON'S AND HE'LL BE I AM. BUT BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT WHAT WE WOULD GET FROM THAT -- AB AND I ALSO IT DEPENDS SO MUCH ON THE OTHER SUPPORTS AROUND THAT THE TEACHER BUT I I HAVE TO TELL YOU I THINK THE RESEARCH HAS UNIQUE BOTH A BA. WITH CERTIFICATION [inaudible] AND I I MEAN THAT'S ALL I CAN WORK FROM AS WHAT THE RESEARCH THAT AGAIN THAT'S WE LEARNED IT IN NEW JERSEY AS I WAS REALLY IMPRESSED. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE NEXT PANEL. THAT IT WAS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR A LOT. OF WORK. FOR GETTING THE HIGHER CREDENTIAL AND THEN PAYING THEM ADEQUATELY AND IT HELPS THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES -- BUT ALSO STATE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT THE NEED TO JUMP TO GO. OUT OF WORK IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR A DIFFERENT INDUSTRY ASSISTANT TEACHERS ALSO GOT CORRECT. SO I DO HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION BUT I DO ALSO WANT TO WELCOME SOMEONE MEMBER -- BONTA WHO'S THAT WHO'S NOT ON ON THE COMMITTEE BUT JOINING US TODAY IN A BIG CHAMPION OF OUR PRE K. FOR ALL MOVEMENT HERE IN CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- MY LAST QUESTION FOR YOU IS ON THE THE THAT THE THE RATIO SENATE AND THE BENCHMARKS IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT'S PRETTY SAD THAT THEIR THIRTY ONE OTHER STATES WHO. WHO -- PART GOING BEYOND WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY AND YOU'RE TIED WITH THE WHOLE MATCH. TO SO AS FAR AS THE THETHAT RATIOS FIRST IS THAT THAT THE CLASS SIZE. YOU KNOW IT IT'S ALL YOU KNOW BASED UPON HOW MUCH RESOURCES WE HAVE IN IS MISTER MARTZ ISSUE SAID WE'RE TRYING TO SQUEEZE MORE TO OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS. AND FACILITIES I UNDERSTOOD STILL IS ALL THAT EVEN IF YOU HAD THE HIGHER CLASS SIZE AS LONG AS YOU HAVE. ADULT TO CHILD RATIO DOZEN THAT DO THE TRICK BECAUSE YOU EXPLODED LAST UP IN. REMOTE ADDRESS. THEIR NATION ABOUT THE QUALIFY TEACHER. HOW MANY QUALIFIED TEACHERS HE AND I HAVE IN THAT YEAH AND SO THAT'S THAT'S MY CONCERN -- WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DATA ON A LOW RATIO WITH A WITH A HIGH CLASS SIZE SO I I DON'T I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE BUT IT'S PRETTY HARD YOU'RE YOU'RE STILL DELUDING THAT THE HIGHEST QUALIFIED YET EACH YEAR THE AMONG TEACHER WITH YOUR CHILD IS THE SECOND. OR TEACHER WOULD HAVE. ALSO STRESS THAT COMES FROM NOT NOT JUST FOR THE TEACHERS. BUT STRESS FOR THE CHILDREN THAT COMES FROM BEING IN SUCH LARGE GROUPS -- AND I I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THINGS WE DON'T KNOW I'M JUST NOW I'M DOING MY I'M DEVELOPMENT PSYCHOLOGIST SO IT'S NOT ARMCHAIR PSYCHOLOGY I'M ACTUALLY AM A PSYCHOLOGIST. BUT I I I SO I DON'T HAVE DATA TO SAY THAT. THE LARGER THE CLASSES THE MORE STRESSFUL IT IS BUT IT CERTAINLY. IS A REASONABLE TERM AND NOT THAT I'M SANCTIONING THIS BUT THE T. K. RATIOS ARE JUST ATROCIOUS AND I CAN IMAGINE. THAT TOO K. TEACHER WITH TWENTY FIVE DON'T HAVE. EIGHT TWELVE NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND SO WHAT DO YOU ATTRIBUTE THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD WE HAVE HAD SUCCESS WITH OUR T. K. IMPLANTATION AND I LOOK NEAR. GET A RESEARCHER A ARE WHEN THE GROUP DID A STUDY RECENTLY AND THEY SHOWED. GREAT GAINES AND THOSE CLASSES HAVE THESE CRAZY TEACHER STUDENT RATIO SO HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU SORT THAT OUT. I DON'T KNOW -- I I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S JUST THAT THEY ARE SUCH A RESTRICTED AGE RANGE THAT THAT OLDER FORCE YEAH THAT THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE -- LA AND I'D LIKE TO SEE IF IT HOW IT HOW IT IMPACTS IN THE LONG RUN -- NTK ISN'T AS IT'S NOT INCOME AND THERE'S NO INCOME ELIGIBILITY THERE EITHER AND I THINK I THINK I WOULD SAY THAT I I DO BELIEVE. FIVE AND AGAIN AT PLEASE WHEN I SAID I BELIEVE IT MEANS THAT I'M BEING RESEARCH INFORMED ABOUT NOT RESEARCH BASED -- THAT -- THAT -- THE THE LESS CONCENTRATION OF OF POVERTY THAT YOU HAVE IN THE CLASSROOM [inaudible] IN OTHER. POTENTIAL -- CHARACTERISTICS THAT CAN MAKE THE FIVE HARDER FOR CHILDREN -- THE LARGER THE CLASS I SCAN. SO IN NEW JERSEY FOR EXAMPLE OUR CLASSES IS QUITE LOW IT'S FIFTEEN WHICH AT THE TIME WAS THE BEST EVIDENCE THE BEST EVIDENCE WE HAD SAID THAT IT SHOULD BE FIFTEEN IN A ONE TO AS SEVEN OR EIGHT RATIO BUT WE'RE EXPANDING. TO THESE LESS HIGH CONCENTRATED POVERTY DISTRICTS WITH. FIFTEEN SHOULD WE BE EXPERIMENTING TO SEE IF EIGHTEEN WHICH WOULD BE OKAY AND SAVE SOME MONEY THAT WAY AND BE ABLE TO EXPAND MASTER. AGAIN I WOULD SAY EXPERIMENT FIND OUT RATHER THAN JUST DO IT AND THEN FIND OUT. AND I DON'T WANT CHILDREN TO LOSE ANOTHER YEAR AND FALL WE AND WE'RE NOT SURE ABOUT. OKAY THANK YOU ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL. THAT THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. THANKS HOW YOUR RELATIONS WITH OKAY [inaudible] OKAY. OKAY PANEL NUMBER FOUR IS -- UNITY BASED UPON KEY TO IT KEY TAKE AWAYS FROM OUR RECENT TRIP TO THE EAST COAST NEW YORK BOSTON AND NEW JERSEY TO LEARN ABOUT CREE QUE FOR ALL UNIVERSITY QUE PROGRAMS. THREE HAVE ERIN GABLE FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA FIRST AND THEN CERTAIN OF A MORGAN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN AARON GABLE AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA AND I WAS. SO HONORED TO BE A PART OF THE PRESCHOOL DELEGATION TO THE EAST COAST AND TO SHARE MY AHA MOMENTS WITH YOU. TODAY -- YOU HAVE HEARD AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT AROUND ACCESS RATES AND QUALITY FOR OVER A DECADE FROM ADVOCATES LIKE MYSELF. IN THIS HEARING IN THE TRIP WAS ABOUT GOING DEEPER. ARE NOT JUST RESOURCES BUT STRATEGIC UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO QUALITY PROGRAMS THAT WOULD MOVE THE NEEDLE FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ALIKE. AND THAT IS THE JOURNEY THAT'S IN FRONT OF CALIFORNIA OPPOSED TO THE JOURNEY THAT HAS BEEN BEHIND US WHICH IS INCREDIBLY EXCITING. SO TO QUOTE OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT WE ARE CALIFORNIA. SO WE HAVE OUR OWN CALIFORNIA FOR ALL VISION -- ARE TWIN VISION TO SERVE WORKING FAMILIES AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT HAS NOT YET BEEN FULLY ACHIEVED BY OTHER STATES AND THAT WAS MY FIRST AHA MOMENT. WE HAVE A LOT TO LEARN FROM OTHER HIGH PERFORMING STATES BUT SOME OF THIS ROAD WILL BE UNIQUELY CARVE BY CALIFORNIA'S VALUES AND IT WILL SET A NEW GOAL LINE FOR THE COUNTRY WHICH IS VERY EXCITING. AHA MOMENT NUMBER TWO WAS -- DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT BY PREVIOUS PANELISTS AND BY THE MEMBERS THAT'S THE CRUCIAL CONTEXT OF RESOURCES AND ARTICULATION. WE WERE NOT JUST SEEN HIGH QUALITY WELL RESOURCE TO PRE K. PROGRAMS LIVING IN ISOLATION WE WERE SEEING PRE K. PROGRAMS NESTED IN HIGH QUALITY. WELL RESOURCE K. TWELVE SYSTEMS. HIGH PERFORMING STATES ARE NOT HAVING A SHOULD WE FIND PRE K. AT THE EXPENSE OF K. TWELVE DEBATES. THEY'RE RAISING ALL BOATS. ONE YEAR STRATEGIC INVESTMENT IN CHILDREN OR CANNOT BE CONSIDERED A SILVER BULLET FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP IT'S PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION TO BEING THE FORTY FIRST NATION IN PER PUPIL SPENDING. COMPARED TO SECOND SEVENTH AND EIGHTH IN THE NATION WHICH IS WHAT WE WERE SAYING ON THE EAST COAST. AND THIS ARTICULATION AT THAT WE SAW HAD RESPECT FOR COMMUNITY BASED MIX DELIVERY CHILD DEVELOPMENT BASED APPROACHES WASN'T ABOUT PUSHING KATE TWELVE DOWN. INTO WHAT WORKS FOR CHILDREN BUT BEING RESPECTFUL WHAT HAS BEEN SEEN FOR GENERATIONS THAT WORKS FOR CHILD DEVELOPMENT. WE SAW PRE K. PROGRAMS ARTICULATED IN TWO K. TWELVE FOR TEACHER PROFESSIONAL SUPPORT ASSESSMENTS AND CURRICULUM. TEACHERS IN THESE PROGRAMS ARE SUPPORTED THROUGH THOUGHTFUL PRE SERVICE PROGRAMS AND SYSTEMS AND HIGHER EDUCATION. EXPERT COACHING BASED ON OBSERVATION TOOLS GREAT CURRICULUM AND REAL TIME DATA AND YOU'LL HEAR MORE FROM MY EXPERT COLLEAGUE FROM CD ABOUT THESE FRIENDS. AND SPEAKING OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION MY THIRD ALL HOT TAKE AWAY WITH HUMAN CAPACITY AND WELL AT THE STATE LEVEL. THIS IS COMPLEX IMPLEMENTATION WORK AND REQUIRES HIGH LEVEL ROBUST SUPPORT FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. WE HAVE START OUR STATE LEVEL SYSTEMS FOR DECADES AND WE HAVE TO BUILD. AND THE MY LAST ALL HOT THAT I WILL SHARE WITH YOU BECAUSE THEY WILL SEE THE TABLE TO MISS NEVER MORGAN WHO I WILL AGREE WITH EVERYTHING SHE SAYS. WE DIVIDED LABOR -- IS SYSTEMS CAPACITY FOR DECADES CALIFORNIA HAS STRONG TOGETHER LITTLE CRUMBS OF EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS AROUND INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT FOR TEACHERS IT MAKES ME THINK OF THE PRESCHOOL TEACHERS FOR LOOPBACK LESS. YOU KNOW AND SO RATHER THAN HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM OF INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT THAT WE SEE IN HIGH PERFORMING CALIFORNIA AND NATIONAL CLASSROOMS. AND OTHER COMMUNITY SETTINGS INSTEAD OUR TEACHERS HAVE IS FOR THE BACK OFFICE. AND SO THAT NECKLACE HAS TO BE REPLACED WITH SYSTEMS CAPACITY HIGHER EDUCATION CAPACITY MENTORING CAPACITY AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SYSTEMS AND STARTING WITH JOB IN BED ITS SUPPORT FOR ALL TYPES OF SETTINGS. SO THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THEY'RE DOING AT NIGHT THIS IS SOMETHING THEY'RE DOING ITS PART OF THEIR JOB [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK [inaudible] YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU AND MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS IF THEY'RE NOT A MORGAN WITH THE EARLY LEARNING CARE DIVISION. IN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON BEHALF OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT TONY THURMOND SO AS YOU HEARD FROM SUPERINTENDENT THEY'RE MEANT HE REALLY SEES EARLY LEARNING AS PART OF THE EDUCATIONAL CONTINUUM. AND AS CORPS TO ADDRESSING ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITY GAPS THAT CAN HELP PREVENT THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. WE KNOW THAT DECADES OF RESEARCH HAVE STAND THAT SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN THE EARLY YEARS OF A CHILD'S LIFE HAVE AN ENORMOUS POSITIVE IMPACT ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF OUTCOMES. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN MAKING POSITIVE STEPS TOWARDS EXPANDING ACCESS TO QUALITY EARLY LEARNING CARE PROGRAMS ACROSS THE SAVA PASSED SEVERAL YEARS. AND WE THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON NOT AND WERE ALSO EXTREMELY GRATEFUL TO HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO IS NOW JUMPING AND FULLY. INTO THAT AS WELL AS A SUPERINTENDENT. AS WE CONTEMPLATE EXPANDING PRESCHOOL AND DEVELOPING A BLUEPRINT FOR SYSTEM EXPANSION TOWARDS MOVING FORWARD THERE WAS A LOT TO LEARN FROM FROM OTHER STATES. BUT I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT CALIFORNIA ALSO HAS A LOT TO SHARE AND A LOT OF ASSETS THAT ARE MORE UNIQUE TO ASK. ON THE TOUR ITSELF AND WE WERE REAL MAKE THIS HAPPEN SAID EARLY ADS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AND OTHERS REALLY BROUGHT TOGETHER SOMETHING THAT HELPED US SEE. AND LEARN FROM OTHER STATES. IT GIVES A LOT OF FOOD FOR THOUGHT SO AS WE LOOK AT LEVERAGING QUALITY AND ADDRESSING OUTCOMES THERE WERE SOME REALLY CORE COMPONENTS THAT WERE IN ALL THREE OF THE SYSTEMS WE LOOKED AT SO IN NEW JERSEY AND BOSTON AND NEW YORK. THEY LOOKED IT EXPANDED ACCESS THEY AT THE HIGHER TEACHER PAY WITH PROGRAM REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND JUST A QUICK NOTE THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT A CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND WE LOOK AT OUR STANDARD REIMBURSEMENT RATES. IT IS LOWER THAN THE REGIONAL MARKET RATE AND MANY OF OUR COUNTIES AND IS ACTUALLY LOWER THAN THAT FOR FAMILY CHILD CARE AN IN SAM COUNTIES THE LICENSE EXEMPT RATE IS THE SAME. AS OUR STATE PRESCHOOL RIGHT. AT THERE ARE ALSO AMPLE TEACHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING SUPPORT SERVICES AS WELL AS LOOKING AT FACILITIES AND REALLY CRAFTING PROGRAMS THAT FAMILIES AND CHILDREN WOULD WANT TO GO INTO. SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM'S PARTICULARLY STOOD OUT TO US ON NOT. INTENTIONAL INTEGRATION WE WERE SO IMPRESSED WITH HOW THE IT INTEGRATED ALL COMPONENTS TO ENSURE THAT CHILDREN WERE SERVED AND THE HIGHEST QUALITY SETTINGS POSSIBLE. AND THAT TRANSITIONS TO KINDERGARTEN WERE OPTIMIZED AS WE LOOKED ACROSS SOME OF THOSE PROGRAMS THE USE OF CURRICULUM FLOWED FROM THE EARLY PRESCHOOL TO THE OLDER PRIEST CALL AND THEN UP INTO THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS. WITH REALLY WESTING LESS. THE HIGHER EDUCATION COACHING AND SUPPORT SUPPORT SUPPORT SYSTEMS FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. THE EXPANSION OF PRESCHOOL IN EACH OF THESE SYSTEMIC OUT OF THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. HAVING ROBUST COACHING SYSTEMS AND OTHER PIECES TO ENSURE THAT THE HIGH QUALITY WAS THERE. AND DOCTOR FREEDIA. JUST SHARED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT PHASING IN THAT BACHELOR'S DEGREE PROGRAM AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY THAT CHAIR MENTIONED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THAT ACTUALLY I THINK MOVED US ALL. WHEN WE HEARD THAT WITH IN NEW JERSEY AND WITH IN A VERY LOW INCOME COMMUNITY? THAT DE AND RAISING UP A BACHELOR'S DEGREES AFFECTED MULTI GENERATIONS SO NOT ONLY DID IT SUPPORT THE QUALITY OF THE TEACHING. BUT IT ALSO CREATED ADDITIONAL RESPECT FOR THE PRE SCHOOL TEACHERS IN THE COMMUNITY. IT INCREASE THEIR SENSE OF SELF WORTH AND VALIDATION AND THE CHILDREN THEIR CHILDREN ENDED UP GOING ON TO ALSO GET DEGREES SO THAT WAS THE MULTI GENERAL. GENERATIONAL A FAX SO HELPING THE CHILDREN IN THE PROGRAM BUT ALSO HELPING THOSE FAMILIES IN THE WORK FORCE AT THE SAME TIME. AND JUST A PIECE AROUND PAY PARITY THERE THEY STARTED OUT INITIALLY WITH PAY PARITY BUT LOST SOME OF THAT OVER TIME AND SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO BE INTENTIONAL ABOUT CREATING SUPPORTS THAT KEEP ADDRESSING SOME OF THOSE PAY PARITY ISSUES AS YOU MOVE FORWARD. WELL WE MAY NOT BE FULLY READY TO RID OF REQUIRE BA DEGREES FOR PRESCHOOL TEACHERS THERE'S A LOT AROUND NOT TO THINK OF AROUND FOR EXPANDING ACCESS IN IMPROVING QUALITY. AND IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT. HAD A LOT OF AROUND THEM SO AS WE LOOK AT THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS AND CREATING EFFICIENCIES. IT'S NOT JUST INCREASING HIGHER AD WHICH IS COR BUT IT'S ALSO ENSURING THAT THEIR SUPPORT'S FOR THE WORK FORCE TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IN GOING BACK TO SCHOOL AND GETTING THEIR DEGREES SAID THINGS LIKE COHORTS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN CALIFORNIA THE PAST WHERE YOU WOULD HAVE GROUPS OF TEACHERS EVEN FAMILY CHILD CARE PROVIDERS. GO THROUGH TOGETHER TO GET A BACHELOR'S DEGREE WE ALSO HAD GENERAL EDUCATION COURSES SO THOSE MATH AND ENGLISH COURSES THAT TEND TO BE SORT OF THE STICKING POINT FOR A LOT OF OUR WORK FORCE. TIED IN LINKED TO CHILD DEVELOPMENT COURSE AS WITH OTHER SUPPORT SO THAT PEOPLE COULD ACTUALLY ACHIEVE AND MAKE IT THROUGH THEM. AND THEN PROVIDING COACHES TO TEACHERS THAT'S REALLY INTEGRATED WITH AN A COMPREHENSIVE QUALITY IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM STRESSING IN EMPHASIZING THE QUALITY SUPPORTS FOR THAT. AND THE LAST PART AND THAT IS THE DRESSING EQUITY WE HAVE TO ENSURE. THAT WE'RE BUILDING CAPACITY ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF SETTINGS AND SO THE MIX DELIVERY IS THERE BUT ALSO ACROSS OUR STATE WE KNOW THAT OVER THE YEARS SOME AREAS OF OUR STATE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD MORE WITH QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS. THAN OTHER AREAS OF OUR STATE AND SO ADDITIONAL ENHANCE SUPPORTS WE NEED TO HAPPEN TO REALLY REYES APP AND SUPPORT THE SECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND. MOVING ON FROM THE HERITAGE AND SUPPORT WOULD BE CURRICULUM AND MY COLLEAGUE MENTIONED IT BRIEFLY AND IT WAS REALLY TRANSFORMATIVE TO ALL OF US TO SEE. HOW DEEP AN INTENTIONAL THEY'RE FOCUSED ON CURRICULUM AND PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE WORK FORCE ON IMPLEMENTATION OF CURRICULUM WAS A PIECE OF THAT? AND HOW THEY PHASED OUT OVER TIME SAID THAT IS YOU'VE GOT TEACHERS HAD BEEN IN THE PROGRAM MORE THEY NEEDED LESS AND LESS SUPPORT LESS AND LESS FIDELITY TO THE CURRICULUM BECAUSE THEY HAD MORE TOOLS IN THERE TOO ABOUT. BUT NEW TEACHERS NEED A LOT MORE SUPPORT AROUND THAT. AND THEN MOVING BACK INTO THE MIX TO LIVE WE SAW IN THE OTHER STATES WAS THAT THEY HAD DIFFERENT BLANKS AND FOR DIFFERENT PROVIDERS. THAT WAS REALLY FASCINATING TO SEE WHERE SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL BASED PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS CAME MEN VERSES THE COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAM AND ENSURING THAT IN ALL COMMUNITIES BOTH WERE THERE. KNOWING THAT WE DO HAVE WORKING FAMILIES AND SO A SIX HOUR PROGRAM IS NOT -- ACCESSIBLE TO SOME OF OUR FAMILIES WHO CANNOT LEAVE WORK SAID THE COMMUNITY MADE SURE THAT BOTH WERE AVAILABLE FOR FAMILIES. AND THEN THE REAL TIME DATA THE DATA NEEDS TO BE BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL SO THAT WE CAN SAY MORE ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING SO WE CAN ADDRESS NEEDED INVESTMENT CHANGES AND LOOK AT EQUITY IN WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING ACROSS THE STATE. BUT ALSO WITHIN EACH PROGRAM SAID THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES HAVE THAT AND CAN READ THE REFINED THE CURRICULUM IN THEIR SUPPORTS FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL CHILD. SO AS WE START TACKLING THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE CONTINUUM WE KNOW WE HAVE TO ALSO IN DRESS AND MOVE FORWARD INFANT TODDLER. AND NOT LOOKING AT INFANTILE THERE WITH MOVING PRESCHOOL ARE COMBINED AND I THINK A SUPERINTENDENT THURMAN SAD WE WANT TO BE COMPETITIVE IN THIS I THINK WE ALL LEFT GOING OKAY WE CAN DO IT. WE'RE GONNA GET THERE WERE ALREADY PART WAY THERE BUT WE WILL ACTUALLY AND MOVE FORWARD SO THAT OTHER STATES COME TO PASS TO VISIT OUR PROGRAMS. AND I THINK OUR POTENTIAL IN THAT LEADERSHIP IS REALLY ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE MIX DELIVERY THAT WE'RE MOVING FOR A STRONG PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND ALSO SUPPORTING INFANTS AND TODDLERS. THAT WERE INSURING THAT DO A LANGUAGE LEARNERS ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S ASSETS IS FULLY INTEGRATED WITH A BILINGUAL PROGRAM AND SUPPORTING CAPACITY BUILDING AROUND THAT. AND LASTLY ENSURING THAT ALL CHILDREN CAN PARTICIPATE SAID THAT THESE PROGRAMS ARE FULL INCLUSION AND REALLY SUPPORT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. SAID THAT THE CLASSROOMS AND PROGRAMS ARE FOR EVERYONE. THAT'S ALL I HAVE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION I I WANTED TO WELCOME ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- BERMAN -- TO THE HEARING TODAY NOT ON THE BUT A BIG SUPPORTER OF ECT AND FIRST RAN FOR OFFICE SO AS TO MAKE SURE WE STEP IT UP IN CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. SEVEN YES I WANTED TO ASK YOU. A COUPLE QUESTIONS OF YOU IN THESE THIS WILL ALSO BE FOR THE FOR THE NEXT PANEL AS WELL. SO FOR ALL THE TALK ABOUT CALIFORNIA AT STEPPINGUP AND BEING A PRE K. FOR ALL STATE. I THINK FOR SOMEONE PERSON WATCHING CASUALLY FROM THE SIDELINES YOU THINK WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING HERE BUT WE WE ALREADY DO WE HAVE OUR CALIFORNIA STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM WHICH SERVES. YOU KNOW HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE APPROXIMATE THAT KIDS THREE AND THREE AND FOUR ALONE CAN KIDS AND SO. WE DON'T WE'RE NOT REINVENTING THE WHEEL AND WHERE WE WOULD BE BUILDING UPON THAT IF WE STEPPED UP SOME LIKE SOME OF THESE OTHER STATES THAT. MEASURE MEDICALLY EXPAND ELIGIBILITY SO MY QUESTIONS FOR YOU. TO ARE RELATED TO YOUR OUR TRIP AND WHAT WE HAVE HERE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THE THAT LOGISTICAL LESSONS LEARNED AND THE BARRIERS IT'S WE COULD APPLY IF WE YOU KNOW IT NEW JERSEY THAT THOSE A SIX YEAR -- ROLLOUT. IS TALKING ABOUT A THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLD LIST LET'S SAY WAS A FIVE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION WHAT WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT. WERE THE AHA THINGS THAT WE THEY THAT REALLY WHAT WE CAN REALISTICALLY DO GOING FORWARD. ABSOLUTELY SO -- I I DON'T THINK IT'S AS IF SURPRISED ANYBODY THERE'S A NUMBER OF BILLS MOVING TO THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW THAT ARE IN RESPONSE NOT ONLY TO WHAT WE SAW ON THE EAST COAST. BUT ALSO MANY THE CONVERSATIONS THAT THE ASSEMBLY IS BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION HAS BEEN TACKLING OVER THIS PAST YEAR THAT IS INSPIRED VERY COMPREHENSIVE THINKING. ABOUT ALL THE DRIVERS OF OUR CURRENT PRE CASE SYSTEM AND HOW IT ARTICULATES THERE ARE ZERO THROUGH AGE TWELVE CHILD CARE SYSTEM. AND NUMBER ONE IS THE ADEQUATE PER CHILD FUNDING ISSUE THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE IN AT INADEQUATE FUNDING TO EVEN MEET THE STANDARDS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. IS AN UNDERLYING CHALLENGES IT DRIVES COMPENSATION FOR OUR WORK FORCE AND IT DRIVES THE QUALITY OF THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT THAT THE CHILDREN ARE IN PERIOD. AND SO UNTIL WE CAN TACKLE THAT PIECE -- YOU THAT THERE IS IT'S IT'S I WOULD SAY THAT'S THE NUMBER ONE FIRST SEQUENCE STEP WE NEED TO TAKE -- AND THEN YOU ALSO SEE OTHER IMPORTANT LEVERS THAT ARTICULATED IN THE JANUARY BUDGET THAT WE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON TOGETHER THIS YEAR. TO THINK ABOUT THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE YOU NEED TO BUILD THE NEW CLASSROOMS THAT YOU NEED IN A MIXED DELIVERY. SYSTEM TO LOOK AT THE SUPPORT CURRENTLY IN PLACE AND THEN EXPAND -- WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE AN IMPACTED TEACHER PIPELINE ACROSS K. TWELVE THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER BY MEMBERS -- SO HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THE PRE SERVICE PIPELINE THAT MAKES SENSE IN A SHORT TERM. AND LONG TERM AND THEN HOW DO WE BUILD OUT ON GOING CONTINUOUS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AS PART OF THE PROFESSION. QUITE A BIT OF WORK IT'S BEEN DONE IN THAT AREA IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A LOT MORE TO DO IN TERMS OF BUILDING CAPACITY -- AND THEN OF COURSE LAST BUT NOT LEAST IT'S IT'S THE THE ISSUE OF ACCESS IS NOT A UNIVERSAL ISSUE ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE AS THE CHAIRMAN SAYS WE HAVE BEEN GETTING STEADILY SO MUCH CLOSER TO UNIVERSAL. ACCESS FOR SOME TYPES OF PROGRAMS -- FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS. A LOT OF KIDS HAVE ACCESS TO PARTY PROGRAMS THAT MAY NOT BE MEETING THEIR WORKING FAMILIES NEEDS WE HAVE TO GET OUR ARMS AROUND THAT AND NOT ASSUME THAT APART DAY SLOT. MEANS BOTH THE WORKING FAMILIES NEED AND THE CHILD'S NEEDS ARE BEING MET -- WE HAVE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE GREAT CHALLENGES TO EXPANDING FULL DAY FULL YEAR OR TWO K. AND EXPANDED TO KEEP PROGRAMS THOSE UNIQUE CHALLENGES NEED TO BE ADDRESSED SO WE CAN THINK ABOUT. THE TWIN MISSION OF CALIFORNIA'S PROGRAMS. I'M JUST GOING OUT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE ERIN CAPTURE THAT SO WELL BUT IN AS WE LOOK ABOUT AT THAT CAPACITY I THINK. I'M TRANSFORMING SOME OF OUR HIGHER END COMPONENTS AND PROVIDING SUPPORTS FOR THEM SO THAT MORE OF THE COURSES ARE PRACTICE BASED SAID THERE REALLY TAKING THEORY BUT IT'S FOCUSED ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT THEORY. SO WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE IN A CLASSROOM THE GROUND WITH CHILDREN EVERY DAY THAT IS COR AND WE SEE A LOT OF TEACHERS COMING OUT AND THEY NEED SUPPORT ON THE TEACHING COMPONENT. OF WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING SAID THAT STRENGTHENING OUT PIECE AND THEN FOUR AND JUST THE STATE AS A WHOLE WE REALLY DO SEE SOME EQUITY ISSUES. AND WE THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A PHASED IN APPROACH ALSO TO HELP PROGRAMS APPLY AND MEET THE STANDARDS OF A HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL PROGRAM. OTHERWISE WE'RE JUST GOING TO GET MORE PRESCHOOL IN SOME AREAS AND SO REALLY SUPPORTING ALLOWING TIME FOR ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN EVEN APPLY AND RESPOND TO APPLICATIONS. AND THEN ALSO HAVE THE PROGRAM AND THE STAFF READY TO IMPLEMENT AT AND THAT NEEDS ADDITIONAL TIME IN SUPPORT AS WELL. THE FOR LOOP NECKLACES AT LOCAL LEVELS WELL [inaudible] QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BRING UP OUR FINAL PANEL HERE. THIS IS FROM A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE WE WANTED TO HAVE A SCHOOL DISTRICT -- AS WELL AS A NON PROFITS. EARLY EDUCATION PROVIDER THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A CONTRACTOR PROVIDE AS A PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT IT WOULD TAKE. FOR FROM COMMUNITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. TO STEP IT UP. NOT A PROBLEM I WAS A SAY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT STRUCK ME AM I MISSING ONE OF THE THINGS FROM THE EARLY LEARNING THAT I REALLY PICKED UP ON WAS THAT IN. WHEN WE WERE IN NEW JERSEY THEY HAD AT OUTDOOR PLAYGROUND? AND THERE WERE TWO YEAR OLDS AND IT MUST HAVE BEEN THIRTY DEGREES OUTSIDE. THAT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. I TELL YOU HOW MANY PHONE CALLS. FROM PARENTS WHEN IT'S SIXTY DEGREES OUTSIDE IN THE KIDS ARE GOING OUTSIDE SO I THINK ONE OF THE LEARNING. MAN THOSE KIDS HAVE SOME GREAT TO GET OUT THERE WHAT. TIME RIGHT YEAH TODDLERS YET AND THEY WERE CRAWLING ON THE GROUND THEY WERE DOING EVERYTHING THAT. YOU WOULD DO US ANY DAY -- I'M GONNA SAY. I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO GO BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS IS. BEING FROM A SCHOOL DISTRICT IS TO SEE WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING SEE WHAT OTHER AND LARGER DISTRICTS. AND SO FOR ME WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO TO IN NEW YORK BECAUSE WE HAVE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND KIDS IN OUR PROGRAM BUT THEY MANAGE TO LIFT FROM EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHTY THOUSAND IN THE YEAR. SO I THINK ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THAT WAS. JUST THE AMOUNT OF AMNESTY INTER AGENCY COLLABORATION THAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE TO GET SOMETHING LIKE THAT TIME. AND THE WAY THEY DID IT WITH INCLUDING EVERYTHING FROM THAT FIRE DEPARTMENT TO LICENSING TO THEIR DEPARTMENT OF ADD PROVIDING. YOU KNOW OVER THREE HUNDRED DIFFERENT KINDS OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE YOU KNOW I'M. WHICH JUST TO MANAGE THE PROGRAM THE CURRICULUM THAT WAS CREATED ALONG WITH I JUST THINK THAT THE COLLABORATIVE EFFORT OF THAT. WAS PRETTY AMAZING TO ME I'M GONNA SAY THE OTHER THING THAT I TOOK AWAY FROM THAT WAS THAT. WE HAVE SOME REALLY GOOD OPPORTUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA I THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF AGENCIES WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO WANT TO DO THE RIGHT THING. AND ABOUT INVESTING IN OUR WORK FORCE I THINK THERE'S FOLKS THAT WANT TO DO THAT THAT REALLY SEE THE IMPORTANCE AND I CAN SPEAK FROM A KIND OF A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE IN THAT. I THINK BEING INNOVATIVE AND WITH THE FUNDS THAT WE'VE HAD YOU KNOW IN LA UNIFIED WAS USING TITLE TO FUNDS. TO SUPPORT OUR TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROBABLY SPENT ABOUT A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS ON TEACHER PD BUT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BRING IN OVER. THREE HUNDRED TEACHER PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND SO I THINK THAT'S A BIG PIECE. AND FRESH TOHAVE IN OUR SCHOOL BOARD AND THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR LEADERSHIP ON BOARD. BEING ABLE TO INCLUDE EARLY EDUCATION AS PART OF THEIR AL CFS. WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT KIND OF LEVERAGE DOLLARS IN FINES TO MAKE SURE THAT EARLY EDUCATION STATE AND FRANK. I AM AND THAT WE WERE ALSO BEING MONITORED AND LOOKED AT AS FAR AS ALL OF OUR CENTERS PARTICIPATED IN THE QUALITY RATING IMPROVEMENTS SYSTEM AND AND I'M NOT SURE KIND OF BLEAK NUMBERS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. IN OUR INITIAL RATINGS WE HAD SIXTIES IN ON A RATING OF ONE TO FIVE WE HAD SIXTY SEVEN SCHOOLS THAT WERE RATED AS A TWO MAY TWELFTH SCHOOLS THAT WERE RATED AS A THREE AND TWO SCHOOLS THAT WERE RATED AS A FOUR BUT ONCE THE BOARD KIND OF GOT. ON BOARD AND REALLY STARTED PUSHING EARLY EDUCATION STARTED MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS. AND WE BOUGHT AN ADDITIONAL COACHING THROUGH AND AT AT THE TIME IT WAS ALLEY AT BUT CHILD. THREE SIXTY IN OUR LAST ROUND OF SCORES WE HAVE ONE SCHOOL AT A TWO WE HAVE FORTY THREE AT A THREE AND THIRTY NINE OR THIRTY DOING THAT KIND OF WORK REALLY DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE AND THEN I THINK THE OTHER PART OF IT THAT KIND OF MAKES WST KINDA UNIQUE IN THE SENSE THAT. WE DO PARA TEACHERS A LIVABLE WAGE IN EARLY EDUCATION PART OF IT IS BECAUSE THEY'RE PART OF THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT WITH YOU TLA. SO WHATEVER HAPPENS THERE AS FAR AS BENEFITS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ALSO BEEN OF OUR BENEFIT OUR TEACHERS. SO TEACHER IN LA UNIFIED BENEFITS AFTER FIVE YEARS WOULD MAKE AROUND SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE COMPARED. TO A LOT OF OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE. AND I THINK OTHER THINGS THAT REALLY MAKE US UNIQUE AND REALLY KIND OF MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SOMEBODY HAD MENTIONED ABOUT. IS THE EARLY AT CENTER PLACE WHERE PARENTS WANT TO PUT THEIR KIDS. WE'VE INVESTED A LOT OF MONEY INTO OUR INTO OUR WIRELESS INTERNET AND INFRASTRUCTURE. AHMED ABOUT TWENTY POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS USING BOND FINDING. THAT WE'VE AND WE STARTED CREATING OUR FIRST WE HAVE OUR FIRST SEVEN STEAM CERTIFIED EARLY EDUCATION PROGRAMS. WE HAVE TEN OUTDOOR NATURE EXPORTS CERTIFYING CLASSROOMS AND WE HAVE THIRTEEN DUAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMS IN EARLY EDUCATION. SO I THINK THOSE THINGS ALSO SPEAK WELL OF I'M GONNA SAY THAT DISTRICTS SUPPORT AND THE BACKING OF IT. SO. I THINK THE LONG TERM ISSUE AND WHAT WE'VE HAD TO CHANGE THE CONVERSATION AROUND AND THIS IS KIND OF AT ALL LEVELS IS REALLY MAKING. EARLY EDUCATION SEEN AS AN INVESTMENT. AND NOT AN ENCROACHMENT. YOU KNOW FOR A LONG TIME IF YOU TALK ABOUT EARLY EDUCATION IS AN ENCROACHMENT. IT REALLY LENDS ITSELF TO BEING CUT. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AND AS AN INVESTMENT AND WE COSTED OUT IF AN EARLY EDUCATION STAY WITH US TO FIRST GRADE? THEN WE RECOUP ALL THE COST PLUS ON IN EIGHTY A SO AS A DISTRICT THAT ENROLLMENT PIECES BEEN VERY SIGNIFICANT SO. I AM. BUT I DO THINK GOING BACK TO WHEN DOCTOR FREE SAID IS THAT REALLY LOOKING LONG TERM AND HOW DO WE GET A QUICK MARK. QUALIFIED WORKFORCE AND WITH KATE GETTING A BA IN NEW JERSEY WHEN THE TEACHERS TALKED ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANT FOR THEM AND YOU KNOW AND I'M GONNA SAY. THEY WERE VERY PROUD OF IT I THINK THAT WOULD ALSO SPEAK TO OUR PARENTS AND THEN IT WAS ALSO THE PEACE THAT ONE OF THE TEACHERS SAID THAT. IT WASN'T JUST GETTING HER BACHELOR'S DEGREE IT WAS BEING ABLE TO TELL HER PARENTS OF HER KIDS WHY IT WAS IMPORTANT TO GET A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. I THINK THOSE KINDS OF STATEMENTS AND PROGRAMS IN BELIEVES BY THE TEACHERS ALSO MAKE A LONG TERM DIFFERENCE SO. AM I MISS IT SO THOSE ARE CONSENT KIND OF SOME OF MY TAKE AWAYS AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE KIND OF DOING IN LA U. S. T. TO KIND OF MAKE AN TO MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE FOR OUR KIDS. OKAY THANK YOU WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS AND STAFF -- SUPPOSED TO BE HERE SCOTT MORE -- WITH KID ANGO COULD DANGO IS THE BAY AREA'S LARGEST CHILD CARE PRESCHOOL ORGANIZATION -- WE GET A LOT OF MONEY FROM SERRA AND SUPERINTENDED BACK THERE -- AND HEAD START EARLY HEAD START -- AND AND FIRST FIVE AND LOCAL -- GOVERNMENT FUNDING AS WELL -- AND YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN AROUND ACTUALLY THIS YEAR'S OUR FORTIETH BIRTHDAY SO WE'VE BEEN AROUND FOR FORTY YEARS -- AND YEAH I I GUESS YOU KNOW WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT FRUIT LOOPS WERE WERE A COUPLE OF LOCAL FRUIT LOOPS HERE -- BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW LIVING WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE OF THE STATE -- POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE HERE AND HUMAN YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS -- WHAT'S BEEN SAID EARLIER WE POINT SEVEN BILLION A YEAR WE SIR FOREIGN SEVENTY THOUSAND CHILDREN -- AND YET NONE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW -- OF ALL OF THEM AND WE HAVE A LOT OF THEM MEET THE STANDARDS THAT RESEARCH SHOWS ACTUALLY RESULTS IN LONGITUDINAL GAINS FOR FOR ME NOW. CHILDREN -- WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING AT ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OR YOU KNOW IMPROVEMENTS OF LATER IN LIFE. AND YOU KNOW THERE THERE WASN'T -- ANY COST BENEFIT DATA IT'S COME OUT OF NEW JERSEY BUT WE CERTAINLY EFFORT KLEINIAN YOU REFERENCED -- NOBEL LAUREATE JAMES HECKMAN AND HE OFTEN SAYS YOU KNOW FOR EVERY DOLLAR YOU INVEST YOU GET SEVEN DOLLARS BACK. I'M IN I'M SURE THERE ARE MANY CONFERENCES ABOUT YOU KNOW THE VERACITY OF THAT I THINKING IN TODAY'S DAY AND AGE OF A NOBEL LAUREATE SAYS THAT WE JUST SAY OKAY IT'S TRUE -- IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME BUT YOU KNOW THE MATH ON THAT IF YOU LOOK AT FIVE BILLION -- IS YOU KNOW AT THIRTY FIVE BILLION BACK AND BENEFITS -- AND YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU'RE TO TAKE SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS AND INCREASE THEM TO THE LEVEL. OF STANDARDS AND QUALITY I INVEST IN THEM OF MONEY RIGHT HAAS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN GET PAID MORE. ON THE BENEFITS BACK WOULD BE HUGE THE WE HAVE VERY FEW RESEARCH ON OUR PROGRAMS -- ONE STUDY THAT WAS ALREADY ALLUDED TO IS THE OUR STUDY -- THAT LOOKED AT TI QUE IN PRESCHOOL -- AND YOU KNOW THE RESULT WAS YET THE KIDS THAT WERE IN TWO K. IT LOOKS A LITTLE BETTER THAN THE KIDS THAT WERE IN PRESCHOOL -- BUT THE REALITY IS IS THAT. NEITHER OF THEM ARE CLOSING THE GAP -- NEITHER OF THEM ARE CLOSING THE GAP IN THE WAY THAT -- WE SEE SOME OF THESE OTHER STATES AND CITIES DOING -- SO I THINK IT'S YOU KNOW. FANTASTIC THAT A GROUP WENT AND VISITED THESE OTHER PROGRAMS AND I DO THINK WE NEED TO BE LOOKING TO THEM -- AS AS YOU KNOW NORTH STARS OF WHERE WE NEED TO BE HEADED LONG TERM ALMOND WITH THOUGHTFUL PLANNING AND INVESTMENT. IN. THE SAN JOSE. WE PROVIDE A LOT OF PRE SCHOOL BOTH FULL THEN PART DAY -- IN A SCHOOL DISTRICT CALL ALUM ROCK -- IT'S ACTUALLY AN ASSEMBLY MEMBER CALLERS DISTRICT -- AND WE RECENTLY -- COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT A PLANNING EFFORT AROUND HOW DO WE GET CHILDREN -- AS MANY CHILDREN AS WE CAN TO PROFICIENCY BY BY THIRD GRADE BOTH IN LANGUAGE AND MATH -- AND WE LOOKED AT ONE MAJOR -- CORNERSTONE OF THAT IS CREATING PRESCHOOL FOR ALL -- AND WE HAD THE DISTRICT AND WE HAVE THE COUNTY OFFICE AND WE HAD COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS LIKE CUTTING GO WE ALL CAME AROUND THE TABLE. HIGH AND THE DISTRICTS THAT YOU KNOW WE WANT TO EXPAND OUR T. K.. ON A COUNTY OFFICE THAT WE WANT TO EXPAND OUR HEAD START AND WE SAID WELL WHAT WHAT WE'D LIKE TO EXPAND. STATE PRESCHOOL WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND EARLY HEAD START AND INSTEAD OF FIGHTING OVER WHO GETS THE FOUR YEAR OLDS ARE WHO CATS WHICH KIDS -- YOU KNOW WE SAID OKAY IT'S CAN GO INTO T. K. THAT MEANS WE GET THE SERVE MORE THREE YEAR OLDS HOW DO WE BRING IN MORE INFANTS AND TODDLERS YOU KNOW WHERE THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT AND WE PLAN TOGETHER BECAUSE IF WE'RE EVER GOING TO GET TO A PLACE. WHERE WE ACTUALLY ARE SERVING MORE LOW INCOME THREES AND MORE LONG COME INFANTS AND TODDLERS WITH SOMEONE'S GOT TO DO THAT? RIGHT AND OFTEN TIMES -- THOSE ARE THE CBO'S. ARE THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT -- ARE THE EXPERTS IN IT AND AND CAPABLE OF DOING IT -- SO WE BROUGHT ALL OF US TOGETHER AND WE DIDN'T JUST TALK ABOUT WHO SERVES WHICH KIDS BUT HOW DO WE SERVE THOSE KIDS AND WE HAVE A HIGH POPULATION. OF DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS ON A IN THE SAN JOSE -- SO WE WORKED WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AROUND OKAY I YOU HAVE SOME TO A LANGUAGE IMMERSION SCHOOLS WELL LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THE PRESCHOOLS ON THOSE CAMPUSES ARE ALIGNED TO THAT CURRICULUM -- YOU KNOW WE WE HAD A LOT OF CASES OF TRAUMA -- WHERE WE ALL SAID WE PORTS A MENTAL AND SO WE CREATED A MODEL AROUND THAT -- CAN FOR US WHAT REALLY -- MADE THE BIGGEST IMPACT -- AND AND AND SPEAKING PARTICULARLY IF COULD BANGO IS. OF A CONTINUOUS QUALITY IMPROVEMENT APPROACH -- WHERE WE FIRST STARTED IN THIS IS SPECIFICALLY AROUND LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT WE LOOKED AT ONE OF THE MOST PREDICTED SKILLS -- THAT -- SHOW THAT IF CHILDREN ARE MEETING CERTAIN LEVELS OF PROFICIENCY IN VOCABULARY AND SOUNDS AND LETTERS AND RHYMING ALLITERATION -- BY THE TIME THEY START KINDERGARTEN THAT IT'S THE BEST CHANCE THAT THEY HAVE FOR READING BY THE END OF THIRD GRADE -- THEN WE LOOKED AT THAT WE LOOKED AT SOME EVIDENCE BASED CURRICULA THAT WOULD ACTUALLY IMPART THOSE SKILLS -- AND THEN WE STARTED WORKING WITH OUR TEACHERS AND WE STARTED TO INVEST IN THEM ME AND NOT THIS IS REALLY ALL ABOUT WHETHER YOU'RE INCREASING THEIR SALARIES ARE INVESTING IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT -- IN OVER A NINE MONTH PERIOD WE WE TRAIN THEM IN THIS CURRICULUM -- BUT WE AS WE KNOW THAT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST MONTH -- SO THAT EVERY TIME THEY WENT BACK TO THEIR CLASSROOMS THEY HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THEIR PRACTICE REFLECT ON IT AND THEN. THEY WOULD COME BACK THE NEXT MONTH FOR TRAINING. AND THEN THREE TIMES A YEAR WE LOOK AT DATA THAT SHOWED HOW CHILDREN WERE PROGRESSING SO THAT INFORM THE INSTRUCTION -- AND IN FRANKLY WAS A GREAT MOTIVATOR FOR OUR OUR TEACHERS FROM FRANKLY FOR EVERYONE THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION. ON AND FOR PARENTS AND A AND THEN EVENTUALLY AS THE CHILDREN ON THE KINDERGARTEN FOR THOSE KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS TWO X. EXCITED TO SEE. HOW MUCH BETTER PREPARED -- THESE CHILDREN WERE. SO YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE. OF HOW LOCAL AFRICAN COME TOGETHER WITH YOU KNOW. OUR MIX DELIVERY SYSTEM AND REALLY LOOK AT EXPANDING ACCESS -- IN HIGH QUALITY ACCESS. FOR OUR CHILDREN THAT NEED IT THE MOST -- BUT I THINK WHETHER IT'S LOCAL. OR STATE WIDE THIS IS THE CONTACT GOING ON AT ALL LEVELS -- SO. I'M HAPPY FOR ANY QUESTIONS AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. A COUPLE YES SOMEONE OVER SMITH YEAH -- I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE -- IN PARTICULAR I I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT I WOULD DO THEME PARK. INTERESTING. SO AT BECAUSE YOUR PRESCHOOL TEACHERS ARE PART IN PART THAT HE CAN KIND OF PROVIDED ME PERSPECTIVE THEN ON WHAT ARE THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED YEAH. SO I AM. YEAH IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE I KNOW JUST COMING OFF OF A WORK STOPPAGE YOU KNOW THE TOPIC IS PRETTY FRESH IN EVERYBODY'S MIND AND SOME OF US ARE STILL RECOVERING FROM IT. SO BUT IT BUT IT WAS ALL GOOD I'M IS A FAR TEACHERS. ORIGINALLY WE HAD SET A A A AND AND WITH A MINIMUM OF SIXTY UNITS. TIME TO BE AN EARLY EDUCATION TEACHER SINCE THAT TIME THOUGH WE'VE GROWN WITH ABOUT 82% OF OUR TEACHERS HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE. BECAUSE THERE WAS ALSO A PROVIDED AT BONUS INCENTIVE IF THEY GET THEIR BA SO THEY CAN MOVE ALONG THE SALARY TABLE SO WE'RE SEEING THAT GOING AT I I DO THINK THAT ONE OF THE LEARNING SO WE TOOK AWAY OR THAT I TOOK WAY PER [inaudible] 18%. TO FINISH THEIR BACHELOR'S DEGREES AND I THINK PROVIDING SOME KIND OF SCHOLARSHIPS OR STIPENDS OR ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID WITH OUR PT AND IT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO CONSIDER AS FAR AS TEACHERS. GOING BACK TO FINISH THEIR DEGREES IS OFFERING.% CLASSES THAT ARE YOU KNOW THROUGH THE INSTITUTES OF HIGHER AT IS TO OFFER CLASSES THAT. MEET THEIR WORK HOURS. BECAUSE IT'S REALLY HARD FOR THEM TO TAKE OFF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY TO TO GO BACK AND TAKE CLASS OF THE IDEA OF PROVIDING SUBSIDIES KAY AND WHAT WE DID WITH OUR PD IS WE PUT THEM ON SATURDAYS. AND WE ALLOWED THEM TO GET THEIR PROFESSIONAL GROWTH HOURS AND FOR EACH U. K. ANTI K. TEACHERS WE USE SOME OF OUR TITLE TO FINDING. TO PAY THEM -- PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT YOU START AS A TEACHER'S AIDE WE CAN PUT YOU ON A PATH TO GETTING YOUR BE A AND WE CREATED A PROGRAM WHERE WE WILL PAY UP TO FIFTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR FOR ANY OF OUR TEACHERS TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND CONTINUE THEIR EDUCATION -- AND THAT ALLOWS THEM TO EARN A HIGHER WAGE I WILL SAY I MEAN I CAN'T SAY IT ENOUGH. ARE THE INCREASES THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE YOU KNOW STYLE FIVE RATES -- OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS HAVE BEEN MONUMENTAL YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RAISE OUR TEACHER SALARIES. BY 45% IN THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS AND THAT'S YOU KNOW MAINLY DUE BECAUSE OF THE INCREASES IN RIGHT SO -- YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S NOT ENOUGH AND WE CERTAINLY NEED MORE BUT IT'S BEEN A HUGE HUGE HELP OUR MINIMUM WAGE IS GONE FROM ELEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR TO SIXTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR -- SIXTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR STILL NOT ENOUGH BUT WORST INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL -- TO BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE IT FROM THE CAN I ADD ONE THING ONE THING THAT WE WERE LOOKING AT IS IS. AN WE STARTED DOING A LOT OF SCHOOL INCLUSION CLASSROOMS FOR CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. AND SO SOMEBODY HAD MENTIONED COST BENEFIT AND I DON'T HAVE THAT COST BENEFIT BUT YOU KNOW IN AYE AYE SENT DOWN AND I ASKED REALLY QUICKLY OUR PRESCHOOL SPECIALIZED TEAM TO PULL THAT BECAUSE WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX OF THESE COLLABORATIVE CLASSROOMS. THAT ARE STAFFED WITH THAT EARLY CHILDHOOD SPECIAL LIKE CREDENTIAL TEACHER AN EARLY EDUCATION TEACHER AND THEN TO AIDS ONE SPECIAL AID AND ONE GENERAL AT EIGHT AND SO SHE SENT BACK THE DATA AND IT WAS. OF OUR THREE HUNDRED FORTY SIX KIDS WHO WERE IN TIME ET QUE -- SLASH PCC THESE PRESCHOOL COLLABORATIVE CON THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO WENT TO KINDERGARTEN WITH SUPPORT. BUT DID NOT GO TO A SPECIAL DAY CLASS. AND THEN OF OUR AND THIS IS THE ONE THAT I HAVE LAST OUT ON BUT OF OUR FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE KITORANG ET QUE STE AND PCC WITH THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM I'M SORRY. THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM WITH THEM AT THE PCC ATTACHED THERE WERE FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE KIDS. NINETY EIGHT OF THOSE WENT TO A A FULL TIME AT GENERAL EDUCATION KINDERGARTEN CLASS. NOW MIND YOU OF THOSE PCC SLASH YES PP SOME OF OUR THREE YEAR OLD SO SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW MANY OF THOSE FOUR YEAR OLDS. HAD ACTUALLY MATRICULATED BUT IN EITHER CASE THAT'S OVER 50% OF THE KIDS WHO WERE IN THE SPECIAL DAY PROGRAMS THAT HAD GONE INTO A GENERAL EDUCATION CLASSROOM. SO HAD THAT NOT BEEN THE CASE WERE TALKING ABOUT NO ALMOST NINE HUNDRED KIDS WOULD HAVE STARTED KINDERGARTEN BUT PROBABLY BEEN IN A SPECIAL DAY CLASS. SO. CHECK. IS IF YOU COULD BOTH SPEAK TO OUR COST RITUAL THAT MIGHT BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEIGHBORING. PRESCHOOL PROGRAM THAT IS CURRICULA SPECIFIC FOR INSTANCE THE STEAM PROGRAM LANGUAGE PROGRAM HOW THOSE VERY FRIENDLY. YOUR STANDARD. BUT THERE IS A COST DIFFERENCE AT ALL [inaudible] SURE. YEAH I MEAN THERE. ARE -- YOU HAVE TO INVEST. IN YOUR YOU KNOW TEACHERS -- UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO DELIVER ANY CURRICULUM RIGHT SO -- IF YOU'RE USING -- MORE GENERAL CURRICULUM LIKE IN CREATED CREEK COMES PROBABLY THE MOST WIDELY USED -- IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY COST MORE TO DO A STEAM SPECIFIC CURRICULA -- BUT TO DO ANY CURRICULAR WELL YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN BOTH PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT. YEAH AND I I'D SAY WITH OTHER THAN -- THE MATERIALS COSTS SO FOR OUR DUAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMS -- WE WE DO USE CREATIVE CURRICULUM BUT IT'S THE SAME THING IT'S NOT NECESSARY THE CURRICULUM IT'S TO SUPPORT YOU PUT BEHIND IT. AND SO WE'VE DONE A LOT OF TRAINING I MEAN EVERY TEACHER HAS GONE THROUGH THAT TRAINING AND THEN. GONE THROUGH WHAT WE CALL CREATIVE CURRICULUM PART. TWO WHICH IS NOW THAT YOU'VE HAD A YEAR OF USING AT WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED TO NOW. AND I THINK WITH THAT. AND THE COACHING IS A BIG PIECE OF THAT WITH OUR DOOR LANGUAGE PROGRAMS THE COACH IS GOING THERE AT LEAST. ADMINISTER ALMOST WEEKLY. TIME TO VISIT THE TEACHER SO THAT ANY OF THE STRATEGIES THAT THEY'VE LEARNED THROUGH THE FOURTEEN DAYS OF PD THAT THEY GO THROUGH DURING THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. WE CAN MONITOR AND WE CAN WORK WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE STRATEGIES. THAT ARE REALLY BASED AROUND OR LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT ARE BEING USED. AND THEN WE GET A SUMMER BRIDGE PROGRAM WHERE THAT TEACHERS CAME FOR TWO WEEKS STRAIGHT. AND WORKED IN AN EARLY EDUCATION CENTER CLASSROOM TO PRACTICE THOSE LESSONS AND AND SOME OF THE STRATEGIES THAT WE CAN. IN THAT THEY FOUND THAT THEY FELT LIKE THEY STRUGGLED WITH. SO IT'S KIND OF A LESSON STUDY MODEL BUT I THINK THOSE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS AND BE SUCKED INTO BE SIGNED STATE MATERIALS COSTS ARE THE ONES THAT YOU KNOW. REALLY BENEFIT THE TEACHERS. ONE FINAL QUESTION. I THINK I'M SORRY MY LIGHT KEEPS GOING OFF HARD TO TELL IF I IF YOU CAN HEAR ME NOW I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME -- I PARTICULARLY LIKE THAT YOU -- HIGHLIGHTED YOUR STATISTIC ON PERSISTENCE THROUGH FIRST GRADE AND THE COSTS -- YOU KNOW RECOUP TO THEIR WITH OFFERING HIGH QUALITY PRE K. PROGRAMMING WHAT OTHER KINDS OF LONGITUDINAL DATA IN BOTH PROGRAMS THAT ARE YOU COLLECTING AT THIS POINT ON STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE. IN YOUR PROGRAMS AND AND DO YOU TRACK THEM THEN ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM. WHAT I CAN SEE WE HAVEN'T TRACKED HIM ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE K. TWELVE SYSTEM? AND WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO WE'VE BEEN WE'VE STARTED TO TRACK THEM FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS FROM AN EARLY HEAD PROGRAM TO THE KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS. AND THE FIRST DATA WE LOOKED AT WAS NOW IT'S THE L. PACK BUT WE USED TO WE LOOKED AT CELL DATA. WHICH IS THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT TEST. SO WE COULD JUST SEE. IN COMPARISON TO KIDS YOU'VE NEVER HAD A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM AND HOW OUR KIDS SOMETHING IN SO WE FOUND OVERWHELMINGLY. ALL THE KIDS WHO WERE COMING OUT OF AN EARLY AND PROGRAM I'M I'M GONNA SAY OTHER THAN A FEW CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. I'M SOUTH AT A TWO OR THREE AND MANY OF THEM I FACT SO WE KNOW THAT. DOWN THE LINE IT SAVES THE DISTRICT MONEY FROM HAVING TO INVEST IN PROGRAMS FOR AL TELLS OR LONG TERM ENGLISH LEARNERS. AND THE OTHER DATA WE USE IS DOUBLES AND SO WE LOOK AT DOUBLES DATA AND AND IT'S KIND OF RESTRICTIVE BECAUSE IT REALLY LOOKS AT JUST A FEW AREAS. BUT THEY'RE GOOD PREDICTORS OF READING FLUENCY AND AND AND LATER ON SO WE'VE DONE THAT NOW WE'RE ENTERING OUR SECOND YEAR OF LOOKING AND IT'S WE HAVE KINDERGARTEN FIRST GRADE DATA. AND I WISH I HAD IT IN FRONT OF ME BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN KIDS WHO HAD AN EARLY AT PROGRAM AND THOSE WHO DIDN'T IT'S VERY DRASTIC. TIME. FROM KIDS WHO HAVEN'T HAD ANY PRESCHOOL EXPERIENCE -- THANKS TO A LOCAL PILOT WE'VE JUST STARTED -- TO ASSIGN OURSTUDENTS IN PRESCHOOL WITH CAL PADS ID'S THAT ARE ASSIGNED BY THE DISTRICT -- WHERE THEY LIVE -- IT SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY LONGITUDINAL DATA BUT IT'S HOPEFULLY ON THE WAY I MEAN I THINK. HE WITH HAVING A CONVERSATION EARLIER WITH WITH ERIN CABLE AND WE'RE SAYING YOU KNOW DATA WHAT DATA WE JUST WE HAVE SUCH A DEARTH OF DATA ESPECIALLY AT THE STATE LEVEL -- AND YOU KNOW IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US -- I WILL SAY. WE WE DO HAVE AN ON GOING -- STUDY RIGHT NOW THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO'S CONDUCTING. ON OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF A LANGUAGE -- CURRICULUM THAT I JUST SPOKE ABOUT AND THEY WILL BE LOOKING ONLINE TO TO NEWLY AT HOW CHILDREN DO -- ALL THE WAY UP THROUGH THIRD GRADE SO. YOU KNOW THIS IS THE QUESTION. RIGHT AND AND WE NEED TO START FINDING OUT WHAT THE ANSWER IS. THANK YOU I WANTED TO ASK BOTH OF YOU THE QUESTION I ASKED THE PRIOR PANEL. SO OF COURSE WE HAVE OUR STATE PROGRAM IF YOU WENT TO A OF PRE K. FOR ALL PUSHED WE BUILD UPON OUR EXISTING. EFFORTS WHICH YOU TO THE RIGHT LA US THE ESTATE PRESCHOOL CONTRACTS AS CAM DANGO. SO IF WE HAD AT YOU KNOW AT THAT LET'S SAY A FIVE YEAR INCOME ELIGIBLE -- FOUR YEAR OLDS AND EXPECTS BANNING. MAYBE IN IN YOU KNOW HIGH NEED AREAS LIKE IT IN IN NEW JERSEY WHAT WOULD IT TAKE WHAT ARE SOME OF THAT LESSONS THAT THAT WE LEARNED FROM. THE EAST COAST AND APPLY THEM AND SOME OF THE PRACTICAL ISSUES THAT WE HAVE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND UP AND PLAY THEM AND PAINT PAINT A PICTURE FOR US AS FAR AS WHAT IT WOULD TAKE. TO GET THERE. YEAH -- WELL -- YOU KNOW SOME OF THIS YOU KNOW AND IT'LL SOUND OBVIOUS BUT WE STILL DON'T REALLY DO IT IN THE STATE -- YOU KNOW YOU NEED CLASSROOMS. IN ORDER TO SERVE KIDS -- WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ANY PRE SCHOOL FACILITIES FUNDING -- AVAILABLE SO YOU KNOW OFTENTIMES AT THAT HAS MEANT IN THE PAST IS -- YOU KNOW YOU FIND YOU KNOW YOU SERVE KIDS WERE YOU CONFINED SPACE RIGHT WHICH ISN'T NECESSARILY WHERE THERE IS THE MOST NEED IN FACT A LOT OF TIMES WE TALK ABOUT PRESCHOOL DESERT'S -- THERE'S A REASON WHY THERE ARE YOU KNOW IT'S NO PRESCHOOLS THERE BECAUSE THERE'S NO CLASSROOMS IN ORDER -- TO SERVE THEM -- AND I'M TELLING YOU THOSE DARN LITTLE TOILETS ARE EXPENSIVE. COST MORE THAN WIFI EVEN -- NGUYEN THAT'S EXPENSIVE -- TO TESTING IN THE WORK FORCE -- ATTRACTING AND RETAINING -- AMAZING TEACHERS IS NOT EASY -- WITH THE SALARIES THAT WERE WERE PAYING -- I WILL SAY YOU KNOW SINCE WE'VE STARTED TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE WAGES MOVE INVESTED IN OUR WORK FORCE -- WE'VE SEEN OUR YOU KNOW TURN OVER CUT IN HALF WHICH IS GREAT IT'S NOW AVERAGING AROUND 16% AND FOR OUR MID AND AN UPPER LEVEL -- CREDENTIALED TEACHERS OF THESE ARE ARE SO SHE TEACHERS AND THE TEACHERS -- THAT TURN OVER RATES DOWN 28% WHICH IS FANTASTIC THAT MATTERS A LOT BECAUSE THEN YOU'RE NOT CONSTANTLY HAVING TO FILL EXISTING POSITIONS IN YOU CAN START TO EXPAND. AND SERVE MORE KIDS SO -- YOU KNOW INVESTING IN CLASSROOMS IN INVESTING IN PEOPLE. ARM ARE BOTH CRITICAL. YEAH I WOULD ECHO THAT -- THE FACILITIES IS ALWAYS A CHALLENGE AND WHEN WE LOOK AT RE OPENING SOME OF OUR CLOSE ENTERS AND AND TRYING. TO AND THE COST BEHIND IT. HE YOU MIGHT THINK TEN POINT ONE MILLION GOES A LONG WAY BUT THEN WE STARTED LOOKING AT ALL THE EIGHTY A UPGRADES AND SMALL SMALL TOILETS YEAH [inaudible] IT SO WITH TEN POINT ONE IT'S IT'S NOT A LOT THE UNIT CAN ACTUALLY HAPPEN I THINK WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT PAINTING A PICTURE. MA'AM I THINK LONG TERM WE NEED TO DEVELOP BETTER CAREER PATHWAYS FOR FOLKS -- INCLUDING CONTINUING AD -- I THINK BRINGING BACK SOMETHING LIKE THE EARLY HEAD CREDENTIAL THAT WAS ON THE BOOKS IN CTC WOULD BE A HUGE THAT. TIME IT EXISTS. AND NOW IT'S A MATTER OF GETTING HIGHER INSTITUTES OF HIGHER ADD TO ONE AND ALSO BRING THAT BACK. THINK THAT FEEDS THE WORK FORCE AND THAT REALLY WANTS TO WORK WITH YOUNG CHILDREN. YOU KNOW I CAN TELL YOU AS A FIFTH GRADE TEACHER. AND HAVING TO BE. PICK MY CLASS SELECTION BASED ON SENIORITY AND THEN THAT YOU KNOW FIVE YEARS LATER ALL OF A SUDDEN FINDING OUT THAT I'M NOT GONNA TEACH FIFTH GRADE AND I'M GONNA TEACH KINDERGARTEN. YOU NOW AFTER THAT FIRST TO HAVE KIDS CRYING I WAS IT I WAS READY TO CALL IT QUITS. BUT I THINK THOSE KINDS OF THINGS BECAUSE IF YOU INVEST IN THEM AND YOU INVEST IN PEOPLE WHO REALLY WANT TO WORK WITH OUR YOUNG CHILDREN AND THEN YOU PAID THEM. INAPPROPRIATELY YOU'RE GONNA GET THEM AND BUT IT'S A MATTER OF ALIGNING THOSE OTHER PIECES SO IN FIVE YEARS. I CAN DEFINITELY SEE WORKING WITH HIGH INSTITUTES OF HIGHER ED WORKING WITH CTC TO BRING BACK AN EARLY A CREDENTIAL OR EVEN AN ADDED AUTHORIZATION FOR PEOPLE HAVE A MULTIPLE SUBJECT. NEAR THAT WANT TO GO BACK AND DO SOMETHING. AND I THINK ALSO BRINGING KIND OF CLOUD CERTIFICATION TO EARLY EDUCATION TEACHERS WHERE THEY UNDERSTAND HOW TO WORK WITH. DOOR LANGUAGE LEARNERS BUT ALSO BE VERY VERY HELPFUL AND I THINK TEACHERS WOULD FIND IT HELPFUL. TIME. ON HIM. IF WE HAD MENTIONED TRAUMA INFORMED AND I THINK WITH THE POPULATIONS WE WORK WITH A LOT OF TIMES WITH SUBSIDIZED PROGRAMS. I THINK YOU NEED TO ALSO BRING BACK ORDERED LOOK AT PROVIDING TRAINING FOR TEACHERS AND TRAUMA INFORMED CARE AND WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE FOR THEM AS TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM. SO THIS WOULD BE KIND OF SOME OF THE IN. FOR STEPS IF. AS FAR AS THE CREDENTIAL OF COURSE IT COMES WITH COMPENSATION I GUESS IT'S HARD. TO FOR SOMEBODY TO GET THE CREDENTIAL OF THEIR NOT GONNA GET. PAID. ACCORDINGLY TO HOW MUCH THEY COULD MAKE DURING ANOTHER CAREER DRESS STUDENT LOANS AND SO FORTH. SO AT THAT COULD TANGO YOU SAID YOU GIVE YOUR WORK FIRST FIVE GRAND A YEAR TO GO BACK. TO SCHOOL AND THEN GET IT WHAT'S THE WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WE'LL PAY YOU GIVE THE REWARD TEACHERS WHEN THEY GET THAT. BA SO WHAT'S WHAT'S THE DIFF BETWEEN THAT AND SOMEBODY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE -- THE THE SALARY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TEACHER AIDE -- AND ARE SORT OF HIGHEST PAID HEAD START -- TEACHER WHICH IS A BE A LEVEL. HOBBY A WITH YOU KNOW TWENTY FOUR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION UNITS -- NOT JUST THE LAME POLITICAL SCIENCE DEGREE LIKE I HAVE -- IS SAID THE TEACHER RATE IS AT SIXTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR AND BILL THE TEACHERS ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWENTY THREE AND TWENTY FIVE SO THAT ALL OF YOUR LEAD TEACHERS HAVE A BA. BY IN HEAD START YES YES -- MUSICAL NOT FOR STATE PRESCHOOL BECAUSE IT'S NOT A REQUIREMENT -- AND THAT YOU'RE STATE PRESCHOOL TEACHERS YA GET TO TEACHERS TO CLASSROOMS ONE HAS THAT. THE A IN ONE DOES NOT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THE SALARY LEVEL FOR OUR STATE PRESCHOOL IS OF THE TEACHER IS -- AROUND TOO IT'S TWENTY ONE DOLLARS AN HOUR. NOW 222-1 YEAH ACTUALLY TWENTY ONE SO THEY FIND IT IT'S WORTH THEIR WHILE. TO THE DIFFERENTIAL FOR THE BE THE COST GETTING A BA -- I CAN'T NECESSARILY SPEAK FOR THEM -- THE ALTHOUGH THERE ARE FEW HERE TODAY WHO WHO WELL ALL I WILL SAY -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE AMAZING EXAMPLES OF THE OUR TEACHERS WHO HAVE IN OVER YEARS WORKED HARD TO GET THEIR BA'S AND YOU KNOW THE INVESTING IN THEM HAS ENABLED THEM TO DO THAT. I AND IT'S CHANGED THEIR LIFE IN IN MANY RESPECTS BEYOND JUST. YOU KNOW HIGHER SALARY -- AN IT DOES OPEN UP OTHER DOORS FOR THEM -- SO YOU KNOW WE CAN PROVIDE EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES FOR CHILDREN THEY CAN DO THAT. WITH A BACHELOR'S DEGREE -- THEY CAN GO ON AND GET THEIR MASTER'S DEGREE AND BECOME A REALLY TELL THE MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTANT WHICH WE ALSO DO -- OR THEY CAN LEAVE US WE'VE HAD FOLKS LEAVE US AND BECOME CREDENTIALED TEACHERS -- CREDENTIALED SPECIAL ED TEACHERS I MEAN THESE ARE FOLKS WHO HAVE YOU KNOW TEN FIFTEEN YEARS EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH YOUNG CHILDREN THAT ARE NOW GOING TO BE YOU KNOW KINDERGARTEN OR FIRST OR SECOND GRADE TEACHERS WHICH IS GREAT. YOU KNOW I MEAN WE LOSE THEM BUT WE SELL ACCOMPLISHMENT AT THE SAME TIME [inaudible] OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU BOTH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION -- I I JUST WANT AS I KNOW WE'RE GONNA PUBLIC COMMON NOW BUT FOR THE STATE TO THIS TOWN THE OTHERS THIS WAS EXTREMELY HELPFUL. TO UNDERSTANDING -- YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS FAR AS EARLY LEARNING AND CALIFORNIA'S GONNA FILL THAT PRE K. FOR ALL PROMISE YOU KNOW WE NEED TO DO IT RIGHT AND DO IT WELL. UNDERSTANDING. WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY AND BUILDING UPON OUR EXISTING SYSTEM IS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT SO? THANK YOU ALL AND WITH THAT WE WILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENTS TAB. NOW SERVE FOR THOSE OF YOU INTERESTED IN. PARTICIPATING COULD LINE UP IN THE MIDDLE AND WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO ASK INDIVIDUALS. TO KEEP THEIR COMMENTS -- TO ROUGHLY A MINUTE [inaudible] HI [inaudible] ON YES -- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS BUT THE SALE SIGN ON I'M THE AFFECTED EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE EDGE CALIFORNIA -- AS THE ORGANIZER OF THE EARLY LIVING TOURISTS GREAT TO SEE ALL THIS TRACTION HAPPENING AND AND THIS IS WHY WE DO THIS TO TOWARDS TO HAVE THIS MEETINGS WHERE WE SHARE OUR LEARNINGS. AND FOR ME -- YOU KNOW I WAS A PRESCHOOL TEACHER WHO WAS GREAT TO SEE. THESE PLACES WHERE THEY VALUE TEACHERS US YOU KNOW -- A PROFESSION THEY PAY THEM THEY SUPPORT THEM AND THAT HAPPENED TO ME WHEN I WAS A PRESCHOOL TEACHER I HAD A GREAT -- COACH I HAD OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAINING AND THAT TOOK ME HERE AND NOW FOR ME IT'S MY WAY OF GIVING BACK. JUST SAYING YEAH WE NEED WE NEED TO CHANGE THIS WE NEED IS THE TIME FOR EARLY LEARNING TO BE SEEN AS A PROFESSION. AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE A GOVERNOR EARNING SO WE ASK YOU KNOW THAT'S ADVOCATES AND OTHERS HERE NEED TO COME TOGETHER AND MAKE THIS HAPPEN THOUGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR HELPING LEAD THE THE TOWARD TO THE EAST COAST THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR RON RAP ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS -- I WANNA THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE YOU BEEN A VERY STRONG ADVOCATE FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND WE WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN A PLOT THAT -- YOU KNOW GET THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS REPRESENTS THOUSANDS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATORS ACROSS THE STATE I HAVE A COUPLE OF THEM WITH ME TODAY. TO PROVIDE SOME INPUT. WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED EFFORTS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION IN FACT WERE CO SPONSORS OF YOUR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION PACKAGE -- ONE TWO THREE ONE TWO FOUR ONE TWO FIVE AND WE'VE BEEN VERY ACTIVE IMPROPER ON PROVIDING INPUT INTO THAT PACKAGE SO THANK YOU FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY -- AS I TALK TO MY EARLY CHILDHOOD MEMBERS -- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT THEY'VE BEEN TELLING ME PARTICULAR REGARDING REQUIRING THE BA -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT THEY SAY IS NECESSARY IS A GRANDFATHERING CLAUSE OR A WAIVER OR SERVICE CREDIT FOR GETTING THOSE -- THOSE DEGREES WE HAVE HAVE BEEN TEACHING FOR TWENTY YEARS TO REQUIRE THEM TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL -- TO GET A BE A IS IS BURDENSOME AND A LOT OF WAYS ON THE SECOND THING THAT THEY TELL ME IS IF YOU'RE GOING TO REQUIRE IT -- YOU NEED -- TO YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S AN ADEQUATE TIME LINE I THINK THE PROPOSAL'S EIGHT YEARS CURRENTLY THEY'RE SUGGESTING TEN YEARS THAT'S I THINK NEGOTIABLE CERTAINLY -- IN MANY OF THESE IDEAS CAME OUT TODAY SO THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING -- ANOTHER THING THAT TENTH THEY'RE TELLING ME IS THAT THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL SO YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE DOLLARS. TO GET THE BE A NOT ONLY TO WISHIN FEES BOOKS BUT ALSO RELEASED TIME AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS CAME UP SO IT HAS TO BE A SYSTEMIC APPROACH IN A PACKAGE. TO TO RATCHET UP THE QUALITY OF OF OF THE TEACHING WORKFORCE AND THEN YOU HAVE TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE GETTING THE SALARY THAT OTHER. T. K. TWELVE TEACHERS ARE GETTING CAN YOU IMAGINE LIVING ON SIXTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR AND SAN FRANCISCO IN LA AND SAN JOSE. SO THERE HAS TO BE SOME LANGUAGE THAT GUARANTEES THAT NOT JUST AN INCREASE AND REIMBURSEMENT RATES BECAUSE THAT'S NO GUARANTEE BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET THAT SALARY IF THEY GET THE BA. SO I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO MY TO MEMBERS WHO ARE HERE TO TESTIFY -- DOCTOR BETTY ROBINSON OR FORTY SEVEN YEARS IN SAN FRANCISCO AND SHE'S THE FIRST ONE TO SPEAK THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH THIS CONVERSATION THAT FELL OVER DO AS RUN SAID I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE CLASSROOM AT FOUR FORTY SEVEN YEARS FORTY FIVE OF THOSE YEARS HAVE BEEN IN SAN FRANCISCO. THE OTHER THREE YEARS WERE IN RICHMOND CALIFORNIA. AS I STAND HERE I SPEAK FOR THE TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS OF SAN FRANCISCO -- FROM UNITED EDUCATED SAN FRANCISCO I AM CURRENTLY THE EARLY EDUCATION CHAIR FOR U. S. F. UNITED ITS KIDS OF SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M ALSO THE CHAIR FOR THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS. SO AS I SPEAK I CAN CONFIDENTLY SPEAK. WITH THEM IN BACK OF ME. IN TERMS OF HOW THEY FEEL. AS WE LOOK AT WHAT'S IMPORTANT FOR EARLY HEAD WE CUT TO REMEMBER THAT TKD. IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM EARLY IT'S WE GOT TO KIND OF MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP A CLEAR LINE BETWEEN THOSE TWO BECAUSE OF THE LEGISLATURE WAS VERY CLEAR WHERE THEY DEVELOPED THE TKO PROGRAM. SOME KIND OF TALK ABOUT EARLY EDUCATION AS WE TALK ABOUT EARLY AND I WANNA. MAKE SURE THAT WE REMEMBER FEELING THAT. EARLY IT'S TO BE A PLATE PATH. WITH THE EMPHASIS OF SOCIAL EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND SOMETIMES WE FORGET SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO WATER IT DOWN. THE KEY TO THE KINDERGARTEN CURRICULUM FOR A PHASE I WANT TO STRESS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS. FOR EDUCATORS TO BE COMPENSATED -- TO HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION THAT IS INFORMED AND ALSO SUPPORTED. FOR THE THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION TO BE THERE ALONG WITH HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR STUDENTS. SOMETIMES WE FORGET. THAT THERE SHOULD BE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AVAILABLE IF POSSIBLE. OF THOSE THINGS REALLY ARE IMPORTANT. WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT. WHEN WE HAVE THE LITTLE DARLINGS AND I'M STILL IN A IN THE CLASS OF THE WHEN I GO BACK TO SCHOOL TOMORROW MY TO THAN THE GOT A SAFETY TO PAY THE WAY HAVE YOU PAY IF I'M GOOD ENOUGH THAT THEY'LL THEY'LL? I HAVE BEEN IN SACRAMENTO GUN AT THE SHOW THEM THAT AT WITH THE SHIELD WHERE SACRAMENTO IS AND THAT KIND OF THING BUT WE ALSO SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT. WOULD DEAL WITH THE WHOLE CHILD. SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS WHEN THAT CHAO WALKS IN THE DOOR. THE A BRING WITH THEM ALL THERE'S ALL THEIR LUGGAGE. ALL OF THEIR FAMILY STUFF ALL OF THE COMMUNITY THINGS SO. SOMETIMES WE FORGET THAT THAT LITTLE PARTS OF THIS DEATH NOT OUT OF OF EMPTY. EMPTY VESSEL THEY COME WITH THEIR OWN STUFF TO THE WE HAD TO BE PREPARED TO DEAL WITH THAT. AGAIN I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT -- WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AND WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY WIN THESE VENUES HAPPENED WE WOULD LOVE THE EDUCATORS THE PRACTITIONERS WHO IN THE CLASSROOM EVERY SINGLE DAY WE WOULD LOVE TO BE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION. SO THANKS AGAIN THANK YOU AND YOU ARE BUT YOU BEING HERE TODAY. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR MCCARTY AN HONORABLE MEMBERS MY NAME IS RICO TAMAYO AND I AM PRESIDENT OF THE EARLY CHILDHOOD T. K.

TEACHERS WHO ARE IN THE CLASSROOM AND KNOW THE DAY TO DAY STRUGGLES THAT THEY IN THEIR STUDENTS FACE KNOW BEST. WHAT WORKS AND WHAT DOESN'T HAVE THESE PRACTITIONERS BEEN TALKED TO HAVE THEY BEEN SURVEYED IS THERE? RESEARCH ON THAT WHY NOT SPEND SOME OF MONEY AND I KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MONEY AND IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT MONEY BUT WHY NOT FIND SOME HIGH QUALITY CLASSROOMS AND PRACTITIONERS. AND PAY THEIR SALARY FOR A YEAR GIVE THEM A SABBATICAL SO THAT YOU CAN HAVE A THINK TANK OF PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY REALLY KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE AND HOPEFULLY WHAT THE ANSWERS ARE. I MEAN GIVE THEM TIME TO TO REALLY HELP BE A PART OF THE PROCESS. I'M GONNA MENTION THIS BECAUSE IT'S TRUE BUT I THINK IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED.

AND THE LINDA DARLING HAMMOND OF WHO HAS BEEN A PROFESSOR AT STANFORD AND IT'S NOW BEEN RECENTLY APPOINTED THE PRESIDENT. OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. A AND HER COLLEAGUES CONDUCTED A VERY EXTENSIVE SYNTHESIS OF THE RESEARCH ON THIS ISSUE. AND SHE CONCLUDED AND I QUOTE. PK TEACHERS WHO HAVE EARNED BACHELOR'S DEGREES AND HAVE ADDITIONAL SPECIALIZED TRAINING IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION HAVE GENERALLY BEEN FOUND TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE. THAN THOSE WITHOUT THESE QUALIFICATIONS. THE NURSES TO FOR EDUCATION EARLY EDUCATION RESEARCH A WITCH DOCTOR FREE AS YOU KNOW IS CO CHAIR. HAS ALSO CONDUCTED AN EXCELLENT META ANALYSIS WHICH FOUND THAT CHILDREN WHOSE TEACHERS HAD EARLY CHILDHOOD BACHELORS DEGREES. ACHIEVED BETTER SIR COGNITIVE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL OUTCOMES. SO AGAIN I THINK ON THIS POINT TO BE OF THE GENIUS OF YOUR APPROACH OF MISTER CARTY AND THOSE OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. IS THAT YOU'RE NOT JUST FOCUSING ON THE ACQUISITION OF A SPECIALIZED DEGREE. BUT YOUR UNDERSTANDING THE INTERNET INTO. BETWEEN COMPENSATION SO RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THE CALIFORNIA PK TEACHERS. UP IN NINETEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN EARNED SIXTEEN DOLLARS IN NINETEEN CENTS PER HOUR WHAT KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS EARNED THIRTY EIGHT DOLLARS AND THIRTY THREE CENTS PER HOUR STILL NOT ENOUGH. BUT THAT THE GAP IS ENORMOUS ARE CHIPPING GAP IS UNDOUBTEDLY DIRECTLY RELATED TO THIS KIND OF SELLING CAM IS WELL. WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA YET BUT WE COULD PRODUCE SAID I'M SURE WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF RESEARCH. SO THE FACT THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO BRING COMPENSATION FOR STATE PRESCHOOL TEACHERS. CLOSER TO THAT LEVEL EXPERIENCE BY TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN AND KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS IS TO BE UTTERLY COMMENDED. UP THERE'S BEEN ONE OF THING I WANT TO SAY THIS BUT A LOT OF TALK TO THIS MORNING ABOUT THE DIFFICULTY OF LOOKING OUT OVER THE LONG TERM. FOR OUR RETURN ON INVESTMENT IS RESEARCH DONE THAT I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL TO YOU MISTER CARTY AT CORNELL BY PROFESSOR NAY MILDRED WARNER -- THAT WHO IS HAS A PROJECT. FOR LINKING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN CHILD CARE RESEARCH. AND IN THAT PROJECT SHE SHOWS THAT -- ACROSS ALL FIFTY STATES BUT PARTICULAR EVERY DOLLAR THAT YOU INVEST IN CHILDCARE AND OF COURSE THAT WOULD APPLY TO PK'S WELL. TRANSLATES INTO TWO DOLLARS INCREASE ECONOMIC WELL IN A PARTICULAR REGION OR IN STATE WELL I'LL TAKE THE EGGMAN SEVEN DOLLARS OVER THERE. I'M SORRY THIS IS MORE IMMEDIATE YEAH OKAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THAT THE ALONG THE OF THE ONE ONE HALF AND HALF ASKED TO WRAP IT UP TO YES I THINK SO BUT YOU GET. WHAT I'M SAYING TO YOU IS THAT YOU CAN GET BOTH THE ONE TO SEVEN AND THE WANTED TO THIS IS JUST BEEN PARTICULAR AREA RESEARCH HAS BEEN NOT VERY WELL KNOWN YET? THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ADAM NORTH OF EVERY CHILD CALIFORNIA THANK YOU TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. TO HEARING THESE ISSUES TODAY THANK YOU TO ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS WHO SPOKE IN FAVOR OF THESE I INVESTMENTS AND HE'S ISSUES WERE LOOK AT TODAY -- WE'RE VERY EXCITED AS OTHERS HAVE EXPRESSED BEFORE ME THAT CALIFORNIA IS MAKING OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS -- PRIORITY -- WE ENTHUSIASTICALLY IN SUPPORT OF COURSE IS PROCESS AND WE WANT EVERYONE TO STAY MINDFUL OF THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AND LOOK TO BUILD UPON THE SUCCESSES. AND ESPECIALLY EXPANDING ACCESS TO THESE HIGH QUALITY PROGRAMS -- AT EVERY CAL CALIFORNIA WE OF COURSE STAND IN IN THESE YEAH SICK OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH ANYONE AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND CLEAN THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS UP ALL A I AM A PRESCHOOL SPECIAL ED TEACHER. AND I WERE FOR BERRYESSA UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THIS IS MY TENTH YEAR. WITH THE DISTRICT OF BY ABOUT THIRTY TO FORTY YEARS EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH PRESCHOOL SPECIAL AT SUCH AS MEDICAL OF NOTES HERE AND I JUST WAS HOPING TO KIND OF CLEAR YOU'RE WORKING AS A PRESCHOOL AND YOU HAVE SPECIAL EDUCATION. A YOU NEED A MASTERS TO DO THAT JOB ACTUALLY AND IT'S A DISTRICT -- YOU GET HIRED BY THE DISTRICT SO I AM PART OF CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION ALSO -- I HAD ALL THESE THINGS ON MY MIND OF A JUST A BLACK. SO. PART OF THE THING THAT I'M REALLY REALLY OF MINDFUL OF IS THE TERM ALL BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES WE SAID ALL BUT IN OUR MIND WE'RE THINKING OF EVERYTHING BUT SPECIAL ED. AND SPECIAL IT TENDS TO KIND OF GO IS THAT AFTER THOUGHT SO WE'RE MISSING ALL I THINK ONE OF THE WAYS WE COULD REALLY HELP ALL PRE SCHOOL STUDENTS. IS TO HAVE INCLUSIVE PRESCHOOL WITHIN THE DISTRICTS AND PUT IN MONEY FOR THAT BECAUSE IF YOU LEAVE IT TO THE DISTRICT THEY WILL SAY THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY I'VE APPROACH MY DISTRICT MANY TIMES. WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT IDEAS OF HOW TO HAVE INCLUSIVE PRESCHOOLS AND IT DOESN'T GET ANYWHERE. I KNOW THAT SANTA CLARA UNIVERSE ARE SANTA CLARA COUNTY OFFICE OF ED HAD A REALLY GREAT PROGRAM ON INCLUSIVE COLLABORATION AND HOW TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN -- AND I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD WHEN WE LOOK AT OF FOR THE LEGAL THINGS A FOR FREE. APPROPRIATE PUBLIC EDUCATION I DO BELIEVE THAT INCLUSIVE COLLABORATION GOES INTO THAT I STRONGLY STRONGLY SUPPORT HAVING TEACHERS. WITH -- OF EARLY CHILDHOOD UNITS OF AND I DO THINK THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER WITH THAT. AS FAR AS PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO I DO THINK BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THERE REALLY ISN'T PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATORS -- AND THE RESIDENT OF COLLABORATION TIME EITHER BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT IF WE HAVE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT IT SHOULD SOLELY FOCUS OUR EARLY CHILDHOOD ISSUES WHETHER IT'S OUR IN EARLY CHILDHOOD OR WHATEVER IT IS -- THANK YOU ATTACK INVEST OKAY WELL THAT'S GOOD BUT I MEAN MOST OF MY POINTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. HELLO. HI MY NAME IS ROBERT COIL. I AM A PARENT OF FIVE OF THE SITE THREE VOICE. AND I AM.

HE NEVER REALLY HANG OUT WITH ANY KIDS ALL SORTS YOU'RE A AND HE'S. WAS THE SHY TYPE. N. F. ING. PRETTY MUCH -- MY MY MIDDLE CHILD HE YOU NEVER LIKE TO COMMUNICATE IF YOU TAKE ONE LITTLE THING FOR MANY WAS. LITERALLY SHUT DOWN ON YOU AND DON'T WANT. THE COMMUNIQUE I TALK TO YOU BUT IT WAS SINCE HE BEEN GOING TO THIS SCHOOL. HE BEEN COMMUNICATING TALKING FIS AND IF YOU TAKE IT DON'T TAKEN TO A PARK RIGHT NOW LIKE LITTLE OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW. HE CAN. BE FRIENDS WITH ANY KID ON A PARK AND PLAY OF THEM AND I SEC. GIVEN THE NICKNAME BRAVE I BECAUSE I'M NOT THAT WAY I'M SHY. THANK YOU. FOR AND THEN MY THIRD AND FINAL ONE HE IS ONE HIS NAME IS WILLIAM AND HIS NICKNAME IS NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS. WE'LL GET INTO THAT LATER SOME OTHER TIME. BUT HE'S ONLY ONE BUT ONCE HE TURNS EIGHTEEN HE WILL BE ABLE TO GOING TO THE EARLY. HEAD START AND I'LL BE HAPPY -- TO MAKE SURE HE GOES THERE. AND I'M ALSO I'M A FORMER HIS TOSSED K?T MYSELF YEAH. WELL YOU'RE LUCKY BECAUSE A LOT OF CALIFORNIA PARENTS WHO DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO HEAD START PROGRAMS AS WE ARE TRYING TO DO SO THANK YOU. AND ALSO IF I KNEW ABOUT THE ON THESE PROGRAM HI OLDEST SON IN THERE RIGHT AWAY BUT HE WAS. ABLE TO GO AGAIN IN THE PROGRAM AT THE AGE [inaudible] ABOUT. FOR THREE AND A HALF SO YOU DIDN'T GET THE EXPERIENCE THE EARLY HEAD START BUT HE DID GET EXPENSE THE HEAD START AND LOOK. LIKE WE HAVE THAT HE WAS ABLE TO LINE IS A. B. C.'S AND NOW TO START DOING THAT AT A SCHOOL AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL AND HAPPY ABOUT THAT [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR COMING UP TODAY. OF MY NAME IS MERRY GENERAL WIRE FONG I'M A RETIRED PROFESSOR OF EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION I WORKED AT AMERICAN RIVER COLLEGE PRIOR TO THAT I WAS A PRESCHOOL TEACHER. AND A DIRECTOR OF AN INFANT CENTER OF THE STATE FUNDED DEFERRED CENTER. PROGRAM AND I HAVE ONE POINT TO MAKE AND I THINK ROBERT LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR IT BEAUTIFULLY AS HE DESCRIBED HIS HIS THREE CHILDREN. HE DESCRIBED A ONE YEAR OLD HE DESCRIBED THE THREE AND A HALF YEAR OLD IT DESCRIBES KINDERGARTENERS AND I I WANT TO MAKE ONE POINT AT I'VE BEEN POURING THROUGH. YOUR BILL ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AND AND OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUBIO SPILL LOOKING AT CHANGES HOW ARE WE GOING TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM FOR INFANTS TODDLERS AND PRESCHOOLERS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK PUTS KIND OF A FUZZY BLUR OVER EVERYTHING IS WHAT WE CALL THESE PROGRAMS WE USE PRE K. WE USE T. K. WE GET TO USE -- PRESCHOOL STAY PRESCHOOL WE TALK ABOUT GENERAL CHILD CARE. I THINK WE NEED TO PULL BACK AND AND ASK WHO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ROBERT'S CHILDREN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CHILDREN WHEN THEY'RE BORN. UP TO THE POINT WHERE WHERE THEY HIT ABOUT EIGHT YEARS OF AGE THAT NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR EDUCATION OF YOUNG CHILDREN DESCRIBES EARLY CHILDHOOD AS THAT CONTINUUM BIRTH. TO EIGHT SO AS WE LOOK AT THE LEGISLATION BEFORE US THE THE THE WORK SAID THAT YOU HAVE -- BEFORE YOU WHICH IS WONDERFUL. HOW DO WE NOT A BIRTH TO EIGHT PROJECT HERE -- EVERY CHILD DESERVES A WELL PREPARED WELL PAID TEACHER. WHETHER THAT CHILD IS ONE MONTH OLD ONE YEAR OLD THREE YEARS OLDER FIVE YEAR OLD. AND HAVING WORKED IN OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION DONE A LOT OF CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT DONE A LOT OF PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. IT'S REALLY HARD TO FIT EVERYTHING THAT YOU REALLY KNOW TO BE THAT FULLY PREPARED TEACHER IN TO TWENTY FOUR UNITS AND THAT'S WHAT AN A A DEGREE IS. IF YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO BE HAVE A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE IT'S GOING TO MATCH BUT BE MUCH BETTER. SO IF YOU LOOK AT EACH OF THOSE BILLS LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT HOW WE CAN PRESERVE THE RIGHT OF EVERY CHILD BE THEY AN INFANT TODDLER OR A THREE TO FIVE YEAR OLD. TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE PEDAGOGICAL SUPPORT OF A FULLY PREPARED TEACHER WITH A BACCALAUREATE LEVEL WITH SPECIALTY IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION THERE IS A WAY WE CAN DO IT THAT IS COST EFFECTIVE WITHIN THE HIGHER AND WE DO NOT PREPARE A WORKFORCE. FOR THREE TO FIVE YEAR OLDS. AND THAT'S NOT IF WE IF YOU WANT US TO DO THAT THAT'S IT NOT COST EFFECTIVE WE PREPARE A WORKFORCE FOR BIRTH TO EIGHT YEAR OLDS. SO GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY. TO TO FIND A CAREER PATHWAY SO THAT PEOPLE CAN BE WELL. PAID FOR THE PREPARATION THAT THEY RENDER DID THEY BRING FOR THE THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ON A RICH ARRAY YES. I'M A PRESCHOOL TEACHER FOR SIXTEEN YEAR IT AND CENTER DIRECTOR FORGET ANGLE PUSH SECURITY AND A FIGHT TO PROVIDE SERVICE FOR TWELVE YEARS. IN MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BEING A MOTHER OF TWO BOYS TRY NOT I'VE BEEN HOME FOR SIX ONE NIGHT IN A WHAT TO DO. UNLUCKY I HAVE A FRIEND WORKING A PRETTY COOL PROGRAM THOUGHT ME OKAY YOU CAN COME IN OUR PROGRAM AND IN THE THE OWNER AND YOU CAN TALK TO HER IF YOU CAN GET PRETTY PRESCHOOL. AND THE OWNER TOLD ME OKAY YOU COLD WAR COULD ACT AND THE SAME THING YOU GOT 50% OFF. SO FROM THAT. PERSPECTIVE I REALIZED ALL MY GUYS TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL BECAUSE I DON'T MAY BE IN CHILD DEVELOPMENT. AND IN THE FIRST FIVE IN A WHICH AND OFFERED OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A COURT. LUCKILY I GOT UP WHAT YOU NEED TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND A GREAT MAY BE THE GREAT. BUT IN THE LAST YEAR OF MY BA DEGREE. THE FUNDING IS GONNA TRY ENOUGH HOBBY A COLLEGE FUND SO I FEEL LIKE TO PAY FOR IT. SO FOR ME THAT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO WE'RE WORKING OUGHT TO HAVE A UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL BUT THE BURDEN FOR MORE PEOPLE FOR OUR TEACHERS. TO WORKING ON THE PUBLIC GOING TO COLLEGE I'M FORTUNATE THAT WORKING TO TANGO THAT THREE OF MY TEACHER WORKING WITH ME THEY ARE DEBATE AGREE. SO THAT IS THE BEST SUPPORT FOR OUT. AND IT'S A FIGHT IF YOU CAN DO THAT BECAUSE WHAT DID ACROSS THE BOARD ACROSS CALIFORNIA SUPPORTING OUR TEACHER. SECONDLY I WANT TO MENTION LIKE. OUR TEACHER NEED A LOT OF SUPPORT AND IF YOU CAN SUPPORT THE BETTER I TYPE OF COLLEGE EDUCATION I THINK THE MORE IMPORTANT. THE WANTED TO TOLERATE I KNOW WITH THE DENVER AND A WHAT FOR PRIDE WHEN YOU TOLD ME. THAT ARE THERE PUBLIC SCHOOL THE THE TEACHER FROM PRESCHOOL ALTHOUGH IT TOOK EIGHT TO TWELVE DEBATE ATTEMPTING. TO A CALIFORNIA DURINGTHAT THE BACK BECAUSE RIGHT THE CHILDREN BECAUSE SOME OF THE KIDS DO NOT EVEN QUALIFY FOR EARLY HEAD START THE PROGRAM OR EVEN THE FRIDGE COLD. AND WORKING IN THE HEAD START PROGRAM AND WORKING IN A TAPE RECORDER LE PEN CAM DEMENTED ALL CRICKET GLITTER ALL COMING TO QUANTIFY IT EVEN A FIFTY DOLLAR DIFFERENCE. HUNDRED DOLLAR DIFFERENCE BUT IF WE HOPE YOU BURKE TOLD FREE SCHOOL IT CAN HAUL HELP ACROSS THE BOARD ALL OF OUR CHILDREN AND WE KNOW WHAT THE BENEFIT FOR THEM. I'M IT CAN BE DIFFICULT AND STARTED MY OWN KIDS THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. HELLO MY NAME IS JOHN ASIA AND I AM A PARENT FIRST AND I'M ALSO A PRESCHOOL EDUCATOR FOR KIDDING GO -- I IN MY CAP MONICA TO ME IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA. SO I WAS GONNA COME UP HERE AND I WAS IN THE TALK ABOUT HOW. BEING A PARENT IS -- IS ONE OF THE MOST AWESOME THINGS THE BENEFITS THAT THE PROGRAM HAD MAY FROM MY CHILD CHASING I'M BAKER HE IS STILL. IN THE PROGRAM HE HAS BEEN THERE SINCE HE WAS TWO AND NINE MONTHS -- BUT I CAN'T I CAN'T TALK ABOUT HIM WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT BEING AN EDUCATOR I CAN'T TALK ABOUT HIM WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT. WHAT THAT MEANS WHAT QUALITY IS WHAT THE QUALITY EDUCATOR ON WHAT THE CALL QUALITY PROGRAM AND? HOW DO YOU GET THAT? OF MY FIRST POINT WOULD BE INVESTMENTS. I DIDN'T GET THE JOB WITH COULD ANGLE BASED ON WHAT I WAS QUALIFIED TO DO I GOT THE JOB BASED ON WHAT WAS ON MY RESUME. IT WHAT MY RESUME SAID. CANANGA QUALIFIED TO BE A LEAD TEACHER THEY INVESTED IN ME THEY PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SCHOOLING THEY PROVIDED A CgA GO TO SO IF YOU'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT QUALITY LOW QUALITY MEETS ITS INVESTMENTS. SO INVEST IN TO YOUR TEACHER INVESTED TO THE EDUCATION INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE THANK YOU THANK. I HAVE TO RAISE THIS A LITTLE BIT HERE -- MY NAME IS PAUL AMERICAN I MET HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING SENATOR THAT'S GETTING A SUPPLEMENT. MCCARTY I ALSO WAS ON THE EARLY AGE TOUR ON THE EAST COAST -- I WAS THE ONLY TEACHER THERE SO IT WAS NICE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE -- ESSAY AND HAVE PEOPLE LISTEN BECAUSE EDUCATORS OFTEN LINK WE ARE NOT LISTEN. TO SO THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU FOR LISTENING -- THANK YOU FOR BRINGING EARLY CHILDHOOD A NINE JUST TELL IT TO GROUP THE YOUR TICKET TEACHER TAMMY T. PAY TEACHER. AND HOW MANY KIDS ARE IN YOUR CLASSROOM -- A WEEK AGO I HAD TWENTY SIXTH HOW -- TO ONE IT'S ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES THAT WE WE TALKED ABOUT ON THE EAST COAST TO OUR IS THE STOCKING RATIO WITH. EIGHTEEN TO ONE TEACHER AND ONE FULL TIME PARA PROFESSIONAL. NOT TWENTY FIVE NOT -- TWENTY SIX NOT THIRTY THIRTY THREE IN SOME INSTANCES AS YOU WERE STANDING DOCTOR FRIEDEL IT SO IMPORTANT TO HAVE A PRETTY SORRY. IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR THAT STAFFING RATIO TO BE MAINTAINED. BECAUSE THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION TO CLIENTS I CANNOT MEET ALL OF MY STUDENTS MEETINGS AT EVERY MOMENT BECAUSE THIS JUST ME. I HAVE TO SAY HOLD ON I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE HOLD ON HOLD ON HOLD ON AND THAT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT WHEN YOU TEACH EARLY CHILDHOOD. OFTENTIMES LEARNING DISABILITIES ARE NOT DISCUSS -- IN THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. AND THAT THAT REQUIRES MORE OF YOUR TIME. SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS TO THE FOREFRONT WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT -- WE HOPE YOU CONSIDER WHEN YOU CREATE WHAT IT GOES FURTHER HAVING ACTUAL CAPS THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS CANNOT SAY WELL YOUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT SAYS YOU CAN HAVE THIRTY KIDS. SO THEREFORE YOU GOT THIRTY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT THEY SAID AT THE ASSEMBLY AT THE SENATE. SO. THINGS THAT YOU PUT INTO PLACE DISTRICTS HAVE TO FOLLOW WOULD BENEFIT ALL KIDS. AND NOT HAVE THAT LITTLE LOOPHOLE THAT SO MANY THINGS FALL THROUGH RIGHT NOW WITH AND WHATEVER YOUR CBA SAYS IS WHAT IS THE LAW. PLEASE REMEMBER THAT AS YOU PROGRESS ON THIS AND ALSO -- WHEN I WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS? I WANT TO BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO THE VOICE ON NEW YORK CITY WAS THERE WAS A RUSH TO PUT ALL THIS MONEY BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR WANTED IT. PUT A LOT OF MONEY AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE HOPE WAS THAT WILL STILL CONTINUE TO COME. SO THAT'S A CONCERN AS WE LOOK AT WHERE WE GONNA PUT THESE CHILDREN PRESCHOOL FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS IS FANTASTIC WHERE WE CAN HAVE THEM -- WE WANT QUALITY PROGRAMS NOT JUST DAY CARE AND I KNOW FOR C. T. A. AS CHAIR ON CHAIR OF THEIR FOR THE CHILD EDUCATION COMMITTEE FOR CTA -- TO WE DON'T WANT THEM JUST IN SOME. PROGRAM THE HEAD START PROGRAMS WE SAW WERE PHENOMENAL AND I KNOW THOSE ARE FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAMS I'M SURE THEY'RE THE SAME IN CALIFORNIA HAVE NOT BENEFITED FROM BEING IN -- ONE THE THE FISH HAVE TAKEN NOTES LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE DID THE THE FOR THE I'M TRYING I'M DRAWN A BLANK GET UP HERE AND I GET ALL FLUSTERED. BY -- BUT THE THE THE HIGH QUALITY FEDERAL PROGRAMS WHERE THEY HAVE THE CURRICULUM WHAT WE SAW NEW YORK NEW JERSEY AND BOSTON. WAS THAT THEY ALL HAD CURRICULUM THAT WENT THROUGH ALL THE GRADES PRESCHOOL. THE THREE YEAR OLD THE FOUR YEAR OLD THE FIVE YEAR OLD'S. IN KINDERGARTEN AND THEY WERE ALL USING THE SAME TYPE OF CURRICULUM IF THEY WERE DOING ENGINEERING AND AS A THREE YEAR OLD THEY WERE DOING ENGINEERING IS A FOUR YEAR OLD THEY WERE DOING ENGINEERING THE FIBRIL DIDN'T MATTER WHAT SCHOOL WE WERE IN. THEY WERE LEARNING THE SAME DEEP THINKING IDEAS IT WASN'T JUST YOU'RE GOING TO SIT OVER HERE AND PLAY WITH BLOCKS THERE WAS IN A MEETING BEHIND THE PLAYING WITH THE BLOCKS. AND AND THAT'S SO IMPORTANT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SOMETHING FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS I WOULDN'T WANT MY CHILD JUST BE CHECKED IN ACCORD WITH BLOCKS. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO I WANT TO QUALITY EDUCATION SO AS YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS PRESCHOOL FOR ALL WHAT IS WATER ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS GONNA DO. I HOPE WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT THE HIGH QUALITY EDUCATION FOR THIS FOUR YEAR OLDS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. FOR GOOD AFTERNOON DEBORAH BROWN ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN NOW AT THANK YOU AND MISS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER SMITH AND AND YOU'RE AT THE COMMITTEE AND THE STAFF FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THIS HEARING AND GIVING US A I GUESS A SMALL A SMALL PEEK INTO YOUR COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCES. ON THE TRIP LOOKING AT OTHER I'M LOOKING AT PROGRAMS IN OTHER STATES IS OBVIOUSLY WISDOM AND GETTING BEST PRACTICES FROM THAT SO THESE DEEPER DIVES ON BEST PRACTICES AND ARE ESPECIALLY TIMELY AND CRITICAL -- AS WE LOOK AT THE ISSUES BEFORE US DEFINITIONS OF QUALITY WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES SCALE AND FUNDING ARE KEY DECISION POINTS THAT STATE LEADERS AGENCIES AND ADVOCATES. NEED TO CAREFULLY AND THOUGHTFULLY NEGOTIATE HOW DID HOW THESE DECISIONS IMPACT THE REST OF THE EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION SYSTEM ESPECIALLY INFANT TODDLER CARE MUST ALSO BE CONSIDERED IF DONE RIGHT PRESCHOOL EXPANSION CAN BE A DRIVER TO MOVE. TO A MORE COHESIVE QUALITY CHILD CARE SYSTEM THAT TRANSLATES INTO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN KEY OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFETIMES A HIGHLY EDUCATED AND PREPARED WORKFORCE FOR THE FUTURE. AND COST SAVINGS TO EDUCATION AND OTHER SOCIAL SYSTEMS OVERALL SPECIFICALLY RESEARCH SHOWS THAT CERTAIN COURSE STRUCTURAL AND PROGRAMMATIC ELEMENTS STRIVE IN REACHING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOUNG CHILDREN AND ADULTS INCLUDING LOW ADULT CHILD RATIOS WELL TRAINED CARE GIVERS. TEACHERS AND DIRECTORS SO LIKE OTHER STATES CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO GRAPPLE WITH THESE COMPONENTS AND LAND ON HIGHER STANDARDS OF QUALIFICATIONS CONNECTED TO EQUIVALENT COMPENSATION AND BUILD IN FROM THE ON SET THE RESOURCES THAT WILL NEED. AT THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO TRANSITION OVER TIME AIMING HIGH AND RAMPING UP IS POSSIBLE AND GIVEN THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN A TARGETED APPROACH TO UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE. THOSE CHILDREN POVERTY TO LANGUAGE LEARNERS FOSTER YOUTH ANOTHER SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES HAVE INCREASE TAXES FIRST AND FOREMOST. THIS YEAR OFFERS A FRIEND ASH FOUNDATIONAL OPPORTUNITY NOT JUST PLAN OR CHIP AWAY AT ADDITIONAL PRESCHOOL SPACES BUT TO LEVERAGE THE PROPOSED ONE TIME FUNDS FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND FACILITIES. TO SET MARKERS FOR A LARGER VISION AND MAKE STRIDES PREVENT IN A SYSTEMIC WAY THAT WILL BE NECESSARY FOR BOTH PRESCHOOL AND CHILDCARE EXPANSION THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI I'M NAOMI UNDER A SECOND WITH THE LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE WHERE WE SPENT QUITE A BIT OF TIME LOOKING AT EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION BOTH IN CALIFORNIA AND IN OTHER STATES. I BROUGHT A COUPLE OF OUR BRIEF THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THE CONVERSATION TODAY TO SHARE WITH YOU BUT I WANTED TO ALSO VERY QUICKLY HIGHLIGHT SOME OF OUR FINDINGS. ONE IS THAT IN THE STATE'S WE'VE LOOKED AT WHERE THEY'VE EXPANDED THEIR SYSTEMS WITH GOOD OUTCOMES FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND EDUCATORS. THEY PRIORITIZE QUALITY AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT FROM THE START. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN NORTH CAROLINA THEY FOCUSED FIRST ON HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS BY CREATING A STATEWIDE QUALITY RATING AN IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM OR Q. R. I. S.. AND THAT ALLOWS THEM TO DO THINGS LIKE IMPLEMENT MORE APPROPRIATE ADULT TO CHILD RATIOS AND ALSO PROVIDE ACCESS TO GOOD AT TEACHING ASSESSMENTS AND CURRICULUM FOR THEIR PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION ALL OF THEIR STATE FUNDED PROGRAMS ARE REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN Q. R. S. AND THEY HAVE TO MEET A MINIMUM THRESHOLD OF QUALITY BEFORE THEY CAN GET LICENSE. THE OTHER POINT I WANT TO MAKE FROM OUR RESEARCH IS THAT LEADING STATES HAVE REALLY FOCUSED ON THE IMPROVEMENT PART OF Q. R. I. S.. BY PROVIDING COACHES TO HELP THEIR PROVIDERS MEET THOSE HIGHER STANDARDS AND ALSO BY SUPPORTING EDUCATOR DEVELOPMENT BY DOING THINGS LIKE PROVIDING TEACHING STIPENDS. AND SALARY SUPPLEMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONAL COACHING FOR BOTH VETERAN AND NEW TEACHERS IT'S KIND OF SIMILAR TO INDUCTION AND OUR K. TWELVE SYSTEM. THAT KIND OF SYSTEMATIC INVESTMENTS IN EDUCATOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND INSTRUCTIONAL COACHING PRODUCES BETTER PREPARED EDUCATORS AND THAT'S BEEN LINKED TO IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN. BUT IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN ONLY ACCESS TO CURIOUS FUNDING WHICH CAN SUPPORT THOSE KINDS OF ACTIVITIES -- BUT THE BRIGHT SPOT HERE IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S AND USEFUL CURIOUS SUPPORTS THAT COULD BE SCALED. AND OBVIOUSLY YOU ALREADY RECOGNIZE THIS GIVEN THE TOPIC OF THE HEARING BUT THERE ARE THINGS WE COULD POTENTIALLY LEARN FROM THE EXAMPLE SET OTHER STATES HAVE SAT. FORD -- IMPLEMENTING THESE POSITIVE PRACTICES STATEWIDE THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING MY NAME IS ANNA LOUISE BENITO I'M WITH CALIFORNIA RULING CAN HEALTH BOARD AND THE DIRECTOR OF TRIBAL HEADSTART PROGRAMS AND TRAVEL. THE CHILD CARE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OF THAT EIGHTEEN TRIBES FOR THE DEVELOPMENTAL PART AND THREE TRIBES FOR HEAD START NOW WE'RE A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN OUR PERSPECTIVE OF HOW WE SEE THIS BILL GOING FORWARD. ONE OF THINGS THAT. COMMON GROUND THAT WE ALL HAVE IS THAT DEVELOPMENT PART. NOT ONLY GETTING TEACHERS TO GET THE CREDENTIALS WE RECEIVE TRUE FEDERAL FUNDING OR LIMITED JUST IN MY AREA. WE HAVE BEEN STALEMATED AT THE FOR THE LAST SEVENTEEN YEARS THAT MEANS IF I WANT TO PAY MY TEACHERS MORE. WE CANNOT THAT'S SOMETHING CALIFORNIA CAN AFFORD TO DO. BUT MY ATTRITION RATE IS FORCED TEACHERS. VERY MINIMAL MAYBE MAYBE 2% LEAVE ME. AND THAT'S NOT BAD BECAUSE WE DO OTHER INCENTIVES WE ALLOW THEM TO GO TO SCHOOL AND HAVE TIME YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN YOU BUILD THESE THINGS UP. YOU TALK SOMEWHERE IN THERE ABOUT MAYBE DO. LOCAL COLLEGES THAT TRAIN TEACHERS WHETHER IT'S THE BE A OR THE A A THAT THEY HAVE SOME SORT OF AGREEMENT WITH THE LOCAL. PRE K. OR IN THIS SYSTEM MAYBE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT THEY CAN DO THE PRACTICUM THERE AND THAT WOULD BE FOR TEACHERS. THAT ARE CURRENTLY ALREADY THERE HAVE THE EXPERIENCE. YOU CANNOT TEACH EARLY EDUCATION THE SOMEONE WHO WALKS OFF THE STREET WOULD JUST TO BE A I'M TELLING YOU THIS FROM EXPERIENCE I GOT MY POLY SCI BE A AS WELL. IN MY LAW DEGREE WALKING IN AS A DIRECTOR OF THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS. THE CURVE IS HARD SO YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT NOT IT'S NOT UNDOABLE BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT QUALITY. YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE YOU'VE GOT THOSE IN THERE -- ALSO WE PUT MY GLASSES ON BECAUSE OF REACH THAT AGE -- IN THE YOU ALSO TALK ABOUT YEAH IT'S THE BENEFIT FOR THE CHILDREN MOST DEFINITELY. CONTINUITY. COMING FROM THESE PROGRAMS MANY OF OUR FAMILIES DO NOT HAVE THE CONTINUITY TO HOW THE FULL DAY THIS WOULD BE IF THIS COULD BE THE FOLDING. YOU WERE GOING TO REDUCE COSTS FOR THOSE PARENTS WHO HAVE TO DO THE PRE K. AND THEN TAKE THEM ELSEWHERE. THE COST ALONE CAN RANGE ANYWHERE BETWEEN PART TIME. AS LOW AS MAYBE FIFTY SIX HUNDRED WITH MUCH AS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND A YEAR IN CHILD CARE. TO LAUNCH IN IF THE MINIMUM WAGE AND THESE ARE JUST OLD NUMBERS I HAVE. OF WHEN THEY'RE MAKING ELEVEN DOLLARS AN HOUR I THINK IT WAS LIKE THIRTEEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED SIXTY IS WHAT A FAMILY WOULD BRING IN. BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY. FIVE THOUSAND WORDS THE REST FOR YOUR RENT. IT'S THINKING ABOUT THOSE THINGS THAT MAKE IT A POSITIVE IF YOU DO THIS ALL AND LASTLY THINK [inaudible] OF HELLO. WHEN YOU WRITE LEGISLATION LIKE THIS SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE PLEASE INCLUDE THE WORD TRIBES? BECAUSE AS WE KNOW EVERYTHING IS DONE BY STATUTE AND IF WE DON'T HAVE AN IN STATUTE SOMETIMES OF PARTNERSHIPS AND WE'VE BEEN LUCKY THAT WE DO WORK WITH. OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. DURING A MILIEU. BUT WE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE SOMETHING. THREE HELLO. MY NAME IS SUSAN MONCHO I'M WITH AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH AND SENSE. THE TOPIC OF SOME OF OUR STUDIES CAME UP TODAY I THOUGHT I WOULD JUST -- TRY TO CLOSE THE LOOP -- FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIRMAN MCCARTY. AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR FOCUS ON QUALITY. SO OFTEN WHEN THE TOPIC OF PRESCHOOL COMES UP. THE MAIN FOCUS IS ACCESS. AND THE QUESTION IS ACCESS TO WHAT. AND YOU'RE ASKING THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION. ELS CHAIRMAN MCCARTY MENTIONED. THE LAST TIME THAT THERE WAS REALLY AN ESTIMATE OF UNMET NEED. FOR PRESCHOOL IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN A ARE FOUND THAT THERE WERE. THIRTY THREE THOUSAND FOUR YEAR OLDS ELIGIBLE -- FOR STATE PRESCHOOL WHO WERE NOT IN HEAD START STATE PRESCHOOL OR PRE K.. AND ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX THOUSAND THREE YEAR OLDS. AND WE WERE REALLY LOOKING NOT JUST AT ALL CHILDREN IN LICENSE CARE BUT WE TRIED TO LOOK AT THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST STANDARDS THE CLOSEST. TO THE NEAR STANDARDS SO WE LOOKED AT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN STATE PRESCHOOL THE NUMBER IN HEAD START. AND THE NUMBER IN TWO U. K.. IF WE HAVE. NOT RESTRICTED TO THE QUALITY THAT LEVEL OF QUALITY. THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN SERVE MIGHT HAVE LOOKED BETTER. TO LEGISLATORS MIGHT OF BEEN A NICER NUMBER OF A SMALLER NUMBER. BUT THE POINT IS EVEN THOSE THREE PROGRAMS DON'T MEET THE STANDARDS A DOCTOR PRETTY. DESCRIBED. SO THAT WAS SORT OF OUR OUR BASE. AND WE WILL BE WORKING ON A NEEDS ASSESSMENT. OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. THAT IS PART OF THE FEDERAL PRESCHOOL DEVELOPMENT GRANT THAT CALIFORNIA. ONE AND THAT NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS GOING TO TAKE IN NOT ONLY THE ISSUES THAT I MENTIONED BEFORE. BUT ALSO THE UNMET NEED FOR FACILITIES -- ALSO JUST WANTED. TO MENTION SOMETHING ABOUT T. K. SENSE THAT HAS COME UP. THE STUDY THAT A. I. R. DID OF TKD DID INDEED FIND THE CHILDREN NTK. WERE -- HAD BETTER [inaudible] OUTCOMES THAN CHILDREN IN GARDEN VARIETY PRESCHOOL 80% OF THE CHILDREN IN THE CONTROL GROUP WERE IN PRESCHOOL [inaudible] BUT NOT NECESSARILY HIGH QUALITY PRESCHOOL. AND THE OTHER THING ABOUT THAT STUDY IS THAT THE CHILDREN IN TWO K.. WERE -- THE CLASS SIZE AT THE TIME THAT WE DID THE STUDY THE AVERAGE CLASS SIZE WAS. SEVENTEEN AND SOME OF THE QUITE OF I CAN'T REMEMBER FOR WAS THIRD OF ABOUT A THIRD OF THE CLASSROOMS DID HAVE A PARA PROFESSIONAL FOR PART OF THE DAY. TO SUPPLEMENT. THE TEACHER SO I THINK THAT'S JUST. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING -- CHANGING THE STAFF CHILD RATIO FORTY K. AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU'RE CONSIDERING UPGRADING STATE PRESCHOOL. ARM FINALLY. JUST A WORD OF ENCOURAGEMENT. IT'S ALWAYS A WORK TO DO THAT -- ABOUT. I THINK NEARLY A DECADE AGO. A. R. DID A STUDY OF A PRESCHOOL FOR ALL PROJECT. YES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IT WAS IN SAN MATEO COUNTY. AND IT WAS FUNDED BY FIRST FIVE SAN MATTEO AND FIRST FIVE CALIFORNIA. AND WHAT THE FOUND. WAS WHAT THE GOAL OF THAT PROGRAM. WAS EXACTLY WHAT -- I THINK YOU'RE NOW THINKING OF DOING. UPGRADINGTHE QUALITY OF SOME OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS LIKE STATE PRESCHOOL AND HEAD START. AND OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS. THE TEACHERS THAT WERE THAT GAINED EIGHTY EIGHT DEGREES -- THERE WAS A HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT FOR THEM IT WENT DIRECTLY INTO SALARIES. AND THE SAME THING FOR THOSE TEACHERS THAT GAINED OF A BA DEGREE. THEY HAD A HIGHER COMPENSATION THAN -- THAN THE OTHER TEACHERS -- THE THERE WAS AN EVALUATION OF THE IMPROVEMENTS IN PROGRAM QUALITY [inaudible] SOME OF PEOPLE IN THE ROOM I'M SURE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THE CLASSROOM ASSESSMENT. SCORING SYSTEM. AND IT HAS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT MEASUREMENTS ONE OF THEM IS ON INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT A PRESCHOOL CLASSROOM -- THAT IS THE MEASURE THAT SEEMS TO BE MOST CORRELATED. WITH -- ACADEMIC. ACHIEVEMENT AS CHILDREN ENTER SCHOOL AND NOR THE AVERAGE SCORE AMOUNT IS TWO POINT SEVEN OUT OF SEVEN WHEN ONE LOOKS IT OUT -- PRESCHOOLS BUT IN THE SAN MATTEO PROJECT -- IT WAS OVER FIVE SO BASICALLY TWICE AS GOOD AND THESE WERE STATE PRESCHOOL AND HEAD START TEACHERS PARTICIPATING AND THAT PROGRAM. THE KEY WAS. THE SAME THING EVERYONE IS SENATE WORKING TOWARD QUALIFICATIONS IN A PHASED IN WAY -- COMPENSATING HELPING THE TEACHERS PROVIDING SO WERE WERE AND GIVING THEM A REWARD OF OF GOOD COMPENSATION AT THE YOUNG. AGE SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHRIS FOR MIRACLE CALIFORNIA HEAD START -- THE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN GRANTEES IN CALIFORNIA SERVING ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILDREN ABOUT -- EIGHTY THOUSAND OF THOSE IN. THE FOUR AND FIVE YEAR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS. IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS HEARING AND FOR ALL THE TESTIMONY. A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS AND I'M NOT TO REPEAT ANYTHING THEY SAID BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A WASTE OF TIME. I AGREE WITH. A MID MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ON SOME OF THESE ISSUES I WANT TO MAKE A FOR QUICK POINTS AND THE FIRST IS I I TOTALLY AGREE THAT TEACHERS ARE THE ALPHA AND OMEGA OF QUALITY. THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD TEACHERS YOU DON'T HAVE GOOD PROGRAMS THERE'S REALLY NO WAY AROUND THAT. SO I SUPPORT ALL THE INCENTIVES AROUND AROUND A SALARY INCREASE FOR TEACHERS. SEPARATELY I THINK AS YOU GO FORWARD JUST LEVERAGE THE BEST OF THE SYSTEM THAT YOU ALREADY HAVE. MAXIMIZING EVERY FEDERAL DOLLAR YOU HAVE INCLUDING HEAD START BECAUSE THAT'S A BILLION DOLLARS IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE SHOULD DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAXIMIZE. THIRD. BE MINDFUL OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF AGENCIES THAT RUN THESE PROGRAMS IN OUR HEAD START WORLD ONLY 35% OF THE AGENCIES THAT RUN HEAD START PROGRAMS. ARE INSIDE ELLIE ETS. THE RESTAURANT COMMITTEE ACTION PROGRAMS AND OTHER PRIVATE NON PROFITS SO THAT MAKES DELIVERY SYSTEM WHAT YOU NEED TO APPROACH FINDING AN ACCESS IN A WAY. THAT GIVES ALL OF THEM OPPORTUNITY. TO CREATE THE MARKET PLACE THAT WE NEED. AN AND FINALLY -- JUST A BIG BELIEVER IN TARGETED UNIVERSALISM THAT IDEA THAT WE SHOULD PROCEED IN A WAY THAT IS BEST FOR EVERYONE BUT FOCUSES IN SERVICE THE GREATEST NEEDS FIRST. SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR TODAY APPRECIATED [inaudible] THANK YOU. I'M THE LAST. ONE MY NAME IS ANTHONY LOPEZ AND I'M A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION. IT'S AN A COALITION OF EDUCATORS RESEARCHERS ADVOCATES FOR DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS. AND THE REASON I CAME UP TODAY REALLY WAS TO BRING ATTENTION TO DO A LANGUAGE LEARNERS WE TALKED ABOUT. ALL THE STRUCTURES AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRED TO SERVE CHILDREN WELL WHAT WE HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH. CONVERSATION ABOUT HAS BEEN THE KINDS OF OF ADDITIONAL STE US SERVICES AND RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED FOR CALIFORNIA DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNER POPULATION. 60% YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA IS REALLY THAT ARE SERVED OUR LARGEST NUMBER OF DO A LANGUAGE LEARNER CHILDREN IN THE COUNTRY SOME SAY THAT THAT LOS ANGELES SERVICE OF THE DO A LOT MORE CHILDREN THAT ARE DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS AND EIGHT STATES. I HAVE IN MY FORMER LIFE I WAS THE DIRECTOR OF EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION FOR THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF LA RAZA THE LARGEST HISPANIC. ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION IN THE COUNTRY. ARE I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PER SINCE ITS SUPPORT TO TOWARD. TO UP PROGRAMS IN TWENTY FIVE STATES SERVING A TOTAL OF ABOUT EIGHTY THOUSAND CHILDREN SOME VERY SMALL NUMBERS OF PROGRAMS AND SOME VERY HUGE MULTI STATE PROGRAMS. ALL OF THEM ALL OF IT ACROSS THE COUNTRY WERE DEDICATED TO PROVIDING STRONG DO A LANGUAGE SUPPORT.

A A A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES. OF WHAT WE KNOW IN A RECENT REPORT BY -- IN A WAY WHITE BOOK. OF OCTOBER ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR HIGHER ED INSTITUTIONS ARE REALLY NOT IN CALIFORNIA ARE NOT PREPARED. TO PREPARE TEACHERS TO SERVE DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS SO IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO HAVE HIGH STANDARDS. THE STANDARDS HAVE TO REFLECT THE SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. ASSETS AND NEEDS OF DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS. WE HAVE YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THEY YOU KNOW OUTCOMES ARE IN TERMS OF COST BENEFIT BUT WE DO KNOW. WHAT BUT WE HAVE EXPERIENCE SINCE WHEN DO A LANGUAGE LEARNERS DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF ADEQUATE EARLY EDUCATION AND KATE THREE EXPERIENCE? THAT WILL PREPARE THEM OR THEIR LIFE LONG LEARNING. IN CALIFORNIA THE HISPANICS AND NOT TO SAY THAT ALL HISPANICS ARE DUAL LANGUAGE LEARNERS. BUT WE ARE 23%. ALL OF OUR PROFICIENCY IN READING AT FOURTH GRADERS 23% LOWER THAN THAT IS FOR WHITE KIDS. WE ARE HOW MUCH OF THAT CAN BE CLOSED BY HAVING AN APPROPRIATE. TOOL LANGUAGE EXPERIENCE EARLY LITERACY EXPERIENCES THAT ALLOW FOR CHILDREN TO CONTINUE TO LEARN IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE AS THEY ACQUIRE A SECOND LANGUAGE ENGLISH. OR IF THEIR ENGLISH SPEAKING LEARNED A TO ACQUIRE CARIBBEAN OR OR SPANISH OR ANY ONE OF THE OTHER GLOBAL LANGUAGES THAT OUR KIDS. YOUR KIDS.
