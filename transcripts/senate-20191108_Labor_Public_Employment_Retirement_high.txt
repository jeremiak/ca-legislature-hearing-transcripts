THE SENATE LABOR PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT THURMOND COMMITTEES INFORMATIONAL HEARING ON CANNABIS AND EMPLOYMENT. BALANCING SAFETY AND EQUITY IN A POST PROPOSITION SIXTY FOUR WORKPLACE MOUTHFUL. I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PARTICIPANTS OR TAKING TIME TODAY TO BE HERE AND SHARES SOME OF YOUR WISDOM AND EXPERTISE WITH US. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE LEARN AS MUCH AS WE CAN- AND THAT YOU SHARE YOUR EXPERIENCES WITH THE COMMITTEE TODAY. CERTAINLY THE LEGALIZATION OF RECREATIONAL CANNABIS IN SIXTEEN AND THE FLURRY OF CANNABIS RELATED LEGISLATION THAT SEEKS TO KEEP COMING EVERY YEAR- SINCE DECISION SINCE THIS APPEARS TO HAVE TOUCHED EVERY CORNER OF CAL YET. WE'RE STILL ADJUSTING TO THE CHANGES WHICH HAVE RAISED NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT EMPLOYEE RIGHTS. FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS WORKERS COMPENSATION AND CANNABIS INDUSTRY ITSELF THE SUM TOTAL OF THESE CHALLENGES DEMAND A MORE COMPLETE AND STICK EVALUATION I HOPE THAT TODAY'S. INFORMATIONAL HEARING WILL PROVIDE A PLATFORM FOR THIS WIDE RANGE OF EXPERIENCE STAKEHOLDERS TO INFORM THE PUBLIC AND HIGHLIGHT AREAS IN NEED OF FUTURE LEGISLATION. ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC HERE WITH ME IS- IT WILL BE HERE IS IT WILL BE A SENATOR MITCHELL WHO IS JOINING US THIS AFTERNOON FOR THE HEARING AND ALSO SITS ON THE COMMITTEE- THE I DID WANT TO MENTION THAT ALL OF THE AGENDA OF THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION IS ON OUR WEBSITE SO IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A COPY OF THAT IT WOULD LIKE IT IS THE- YOU CAN GET IT. ON THE WEBSITE AND THE ANALYSIS OF THE HE- BACKGROUND PAPER AND SOME REASON. THERE SO YOU CAN CERTAINLY A COMPUTER LIKE. TO TURN NOW TO OUR FIRST PANEL ON THE FUTURE. THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CAL NORMAL GOVERNMENT HERE IN THE- SITTING HERE BE WONDERFUL. THANK YOU AND WELCOME. THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RUSH TO LEARN MORE. GRANT. RED MEANS IT'S OFTEN HAD DOES MEDIA ON. LIKE MY TV I'LL WE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THE GREEN LIGHT SHOWS THAT. HERE IT IS KIND OF OPPOSITE TO THE AND I MEAN LIGHTS IS IT'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE. A GOOD AFTERNOON- CHAIR GERMAN HILL. THANKS FOR INVITING ME MY NAME IS IGOR GRANT- I'M A- PATIENT NURSE CHI TRISTEN PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. AGO WHERE IDLE DIRECT THE CENTER FOR MEDICINAL CAN SEARCH. AS YOU KNOW SOME OF THE PROBLEMS PROBLEMS OF CALIFORNIANS- INVOLVED DITIONS LIKE CHRONIC PAIN POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY INFLAMMATORY DISORDERS. I CAN SLEEP DISORDERS AND OUR PATIENTS. I HAVE NOT ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO BE TRUE ADEQUATELY FOR SOME OF THESE CONNECTIONS GIVEN OUR EGGS MEDICATIONS AND SO THAT IS A- NEED ALWAYS TO HAVE MORE TOOLS IN OUR TOOLBOX. ONE COULD PUT IT THAT WAY. I'M HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH MY MEDICAL OPINION- ANNA AND IT'S BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE OF THE CENTER FOR MEDICINAL CANNABIS RESEARCH WHICH- AS TO THE STATE OF. KNOWLEDGE ON MEDICINAL CANNABIS AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BE HELPFUL IN INFORMING POLICY IN REGARD TO AND ALSO EDUCATION. CLEARLY THIS IS A CONTROVERSIAL AREA. BUT THEY'RE IMPORTANT FACTS THAT ARE URGING OF FIRSTLY CENTER FOR MEDICINAL CANNABIS RESEARCH ITSELF WAS ACTUALLY ESTABLISHED BY LEGISLATION- OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. UNDER SB EIGHT FORCE OF AN A IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE CENTS THE. SENATOR JOHN VASCONCELOS. REGRET THIS PAST WAY WAS THE AUTHOR OF THAT LEGISLATION SO WE- IN TWO THOUSAND. THE CENTER THE US SB EIGHT FORTY SEVEN WAS REALLY ALSO TRIGGERED BY PASSAGE OF PROP TWO FIFTEEN AND I THINK MAY BE LEGISLATORS WERE INTERESTED IN WHAT IS THE SCIENCE IS THE EVIDENCE BASE FOR MEDICINAL CANNABIS AND SO THAT WAS- THE- IMPETUS FOR SETTING UP OR CENTER. SINCE WE'VE BEEN A STAB LISTED WE ARE COMPLETED- EIGHT SHORTER TERM pSTUDIES ON DIFFERENT CONDITIONS. AND ALL OF THESE- AS IT TURNS OUT A SHOW THAT IN THE SHORT TERM- MEDICINAL CANNABIS WAS BENEFICIAL THE CONDITIONS WE STUDIED. INCLUDED NEUROPATHIC PAIN. NO PASSED THE PAIN AS YOU MAY KNOW IS A CHRONIC- OF HYPERSENSITIVITY. ALL THE SERVERS- SYMPTOMS LIKE TINGLING PAIN- RESPONDING TO A LIGHT TOUCH IN AN EXAGGERATED MANNER AND SO FORTH THE END THIS IS THE KIND OF PAIN THAT'S PRODUCED BY CERTAIN DISEASES AND INJURIES INCLUDING HIV AIDS DIABETES CERTAIN KINDS OF PHYSICAL INJURIES. DURATION SOMEWHERE EARLIER. IN THE NEUROPATHIC PAIN THE REASON I GO INTO A LITTLE BIT OF DETAIL IS DIFFERENT THAN THE PAIN YOU GET SAY AFTER SURGERY- WHERE YOU HAVE A MORE SEVERE PAIN IT'S VERY WELL MANAGED BY OPIOIDS INITIALLY POTENTIALLY OR NONSTEROIDAL ANTI INFLAMMATORIES. BUT THE NEUROPATHIC PAIN DOESN'T RESPOND WELL TO. THINGS LIKE A LOW DOSES OF ANTI DEPRESSANTS AND- ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS THING OF THAT NATURE TO MANAGE THE HYPERSENSITIVITY AND IT TURNS OUT. THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF ANIMAL RESEARCH AND ALSO INFORMAL HUMAN- REPORT THAT. T. H. C. PARTICULARLY WAS HELPFUL SO THAT WAS THE REASON TO STUDY- NOT PERFECT PARTICULAR AND AS A SAY FOUND THAT IT IT WAS USEFUL. IT WAS ABOUT AS EFFECTIVE AS SOME OF THE TRADITIONAL MEDICINES SUCH AS GAP PENTON FOR EXAMPLE. ALSO LOOK TO ADD MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS US SPASTICITY AS YOU KNOW I MESS IS A CHRONIC NEUROLOGICAL CONDITION. THE BEERS MUSCLES LIMBS CAN BE A DEBILITATING SYMPTOMS IN THIS THESE. AND AGAIN AS WITH NEUROPATHIC PAIN THERE ARE TREATMENTS BUT NOT A REPAIRS FUNDS AND SO FORTH SO AND HERE WE FOUND AGAIN AND ONE OF OUR STUDIES THAT A TEACH C. CONTAINING. THIS PRODUCT WAS HELPFUL. IT ACTUALLY ARE. OF WHICH WERE PUBLISHED SOMETIME AGO WERE MUCH ECHOED IN THE MORE RECENT REPORT. YOU KNOW FROM THE NATIONAL. ALBUM OF SCIENCE ENGINEERING AND MEDICINE. HE SEVENTEEN REVIEWED IN A MASSIVE AWAY ALL OF THE DATA ABOUT THAT AND THEY REACH THE CONCLUSION FACT IT'S THEIR TERM THERE IS CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT FOR CERTAIN CONDITIONS LIKE NORA MATH YOUR PATH MAIN OF SPASTICITY IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS A CONTROL OF- CERTAIN SYMPTOMS OF WEIGHT LOSS. AND NAUSEA THAT THERE WAS PRETTY CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE THAT OF THESE TASTY CONTAINING WERE USEFUL SO- I THINK THE DATA ARE FAIRLY CLEAR ON THAT WHAT IS UNCLEAR IS THE USEFULNESS IN THE LONG TERM AND ALSO WHETHER OR THERE ARE SUB GROUPS OF PATIENTS WHERE WE NEED TO EXERCISE GREATER CAUTION. WELL FOR EXAMPLE ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO MAY RESPOND TO- A TEACH THE CONTAINING PRODUCT WITH MORE COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT OF OUR PROBLEMS ALONG THOSE LINES THAT. MIGHT A HEALTHY FORTY YEAR OLD FOR EXAMPLE. ALL THE OTHER- CANNABINOID THAT HAS BECOME VERY- MUCH OF INTEREST IS CANNABIDIOL. NO CANNABIDIOL IS A NATURALLY OCCURRING CANNABINOID IT IT IT'S FOUND IN IN MARIJUANA THE DEPENDING ON THE CULTIVARS THE PLANTS THEMSELVES OF SOME PRODUCE ALMOST NONE SOME PRODUCE A LOT HAMPER FOR EXAMPLE IS BASICALLY CAM. THE DIVA. MARIJUANA BUT IT JUST DOESN'T PRODUCE THC IT COULD BE ENGINEERED TO PRODUCE IT BUT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN TO IN A IN A NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. SOSA CABA THEY ALL HAS- BEEN THOUGHT OF BEING POTENTIALLY FULL AS AN ANTI INFLAMMATORY DRUG AGAIN AN ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUG. AND POTENTIALLY HAS OTHER ACTIONS INCLUDING ANTIANXIETY. ANY PSYCHOTIC ACTIONS SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE AREAS THAT ARE BEING EXPLORED. IN IN FACT UNDER- THE CENTER FOR MEDICINAL CANNABIS RESEARCH WHICH NOW RECEIVES FUNDING- FROM PROP SIXTY FOUR FOUR. A WE HAVE- NOW OF SELECTED FIVE STUDIES GO FORWARD- WITH THESE FUNDS TO IN FACT STUDY OF THE POSSIBLE USE OF CANNABIS. SCHIZOPHRENIA IN ANOREXIA. SEVERE THIS IS A WEIGHT LOSS CONDITION AFFECTING PRIMARILY YOUNG WOMEN. IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS WHICH IS AN INFLAMMATORY CHRONIC ARTHRITIC. CONDITION IT ALSO IN INSOMNIA I DIDN'T MENTION THAT EARLIER BUT OBVIOUSLY PROBLEMS ARE AMONG THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE. HI AND IT'S CLEAR THAT- BUT THE REGULAR OR INCREASING USE OF- CERTAIN KINDS OF SLEEPING PILLS IS NOT A GREAT THING SOME PEOPLE DO IT FINE BUT WITH SOME PEOPLE BECOMES PROBLEMATIC AND AGAIN THERE'S SOME SUGGESTION THAT CANNABIDIOL WERE KIND OF A DIAL IN COMBINATION VERY LOW DOSES OF THC MAY BE HELPFUL IN SLEEP PROBLEMS AND MAY BE LESS PROBLEMATIC. IN THE LONG TERM. THE OTHER AREA THAT'S IMPORTANT. AND VERY TIMELY NOW IS THE- POSSIBILITY THAT CANNABINOIDS MAY HAVE AN OPIOID SPARING EFFECT WITH THE PROBLEMS THAT HAVE OCCURRED WITH- OPIOID OVERDOSES. AND EITHER OVER PRESCRIPTION OR ILLICIT USE OF BOYS- THERE IS AN INTEREST AND SOME DATA TO SUGGEST THAT THE COMBINATION OF CANNABINOIDS WITH VOIGTS ACTUALLY REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF OPIOID THAT NEEDS TO BE PRESCRIBED OR MILLION IN FACT EVEN SUBSTITUTE FOR THE OPIOIDS. BUT IT'S A SCIENTIFICALLY OPEN QUESTION AS A SAY THERE SOME DATA BUT THAT'S I THINK AN EXCITING DIRECT THAT NEEDS TO BE EXPLORED. WELL I'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME. BUT IN SOME BENEFITS SO IT WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO TALK ABOUT PROBLEMS AS WELL- IN AND SOME OF THE PROBLEMS- THAT- THAT CAN OCCUR- ARE OF COURSE. IF A CANNABINOID CONTAINS THC PARTICULARLY IT MAY IMPAIR MEMORY COORDINATION JUDGMENT- ALERTNESS VARIOUS THINGS LIKE THAT DEPENDING ON THE DOSE OF THE US TO FIX OF THE PERSON HOW THEY HANDLE IT. SO THESE CAN BE PROBLEMATIC AREAS OF WATER THERE ARE STUDIES THAT WE HAVE BEEN- DO IT IS JUST COMPLETE IS ACTUALLY- STUDY ALL OUR HOME THE EFFECTS ON DRIVING. IN PEOPLE WHO USE DIFFERENT. NOT USE BUT ARE GIVEN ACTUALLY IN A LABORATORY SETTING A DIFFERENT CONCENTRATIONS OF THC CONTAINING PRODUCT AND SO- THAT WAS- UNDER- AB TWO SIXTY SIX ACTUALLY- MISTER LACKEYS LEGISLATION THAT OF THE SYSTEM. SO WE ARE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE RESULTS OF THAT- AND PARTICULARLY LOOKING AT- WHAT KINDS OF IMPROVE BEHAVIORAL AND ROADSIDE TESTING MAY BE. APPLICABLE BY CHP OFFICERS OR WHOEVER OF. THAT MAY GO BEYOND WHAT WE DO NOW. NOT ONE OF THE THINGS I KNOW THAT'S OF INTEREST TO THIS GROUP IS. WELL WHAT IS THE EFFECT ON THE- EMPLOYEE IF SOMEBODY HAS A CHRONIC CONDITION. ARMED AND TO ME- ONE ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED FULL ON IS OF THE ISSUE OF CHEMICAL TESTING AND WHETHER THE CHEMICAL TESTING CAN BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR IF YOU WILL BEHAVIORAL TESTING OF THE EMPLOYEE. OF THE DIFFERENCE IN- CANNABINOID CHEMISTRY OR PHARMACOLOGY IS THAT JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE HAS SOME SAY H. C. IN THEIR SYSTEM. DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THEY'RE IMPAIRED AND DOESN'T TELL YOU MUCH ABOUT WHEN THEY TOOK IT- AND SO- USING A KIND OF PER SE APPROACH. IT IS NOT A USEFUL THING AND WE HAVE FOUND THIS THROUGH THE DRIVING STUDIES THAT ACTUALLY DRIVING IMPAIRMENT CORRELATED POORLY WITH TWO WITH A BLOOD LEVELS AND SO LIVE AND BREATH LOVELL'S ON CANNABINOIDS. SO WAS THE ONE THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN MY JUDGMENT IS IN THE EMPLOYEE. PLEASE TESTING SOMEBODY- MAY OR MAY NOT TELL YOU IF THEM HE IS ACTUALLY ABLE TO DO THERE. AND IN FACT SOMETIMES ONE MIGHT REACH THE WRONG CONCLUSION. SO I THINK THAT I'D LIKE TO SUMMARIZE BECAUSE I'M FROM SURE TIME IS SHORT THE BUT AND I DO HAVE THE STATEMENT WHICH LOGICAL BUT YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK AT. A BUT I WOULD OFFER THE FOLLOWING OF THE THINGS FOR CONSIDERATION. WE WILL BENEFIT OUR PATIENTS SCHERING THAT PHYSICIANS AND OTHER MEDICAL STE. RECEIVE EDUCATION FIRST ON THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF MEDICINAL ALKALOIDS AS WELL AS THEIR SIDE EFFECTS AND POSSIBLE HARMS. INCLUDING WHAT REMAINS UNKNOWN. OF THE IT SHOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED THEIR MAIN MANY SUCH UNKNOWNS. GIVEN THE STILL EVOLVING FIELD OF CANNABINOID SEARCH. WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE HEALTH PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE UNBIASED AUTHORITATIVE INFORMATION. ON PATIENT ON A MEDICINAL CANNABIS AND CANNABINOID. IF THE PATIENT'S CONDITION OF MAYBE BENEFITTED BASED ON THE SCIENCE THAT'S EMERGING. OF WE ALSO WOULD- PUT FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THAT PATIENTS WHO RECEIVE MEDICINAL CANNABIS IN A MANNER COMPLIANCE WITH STATE. SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECTED TO ANY ADVERSE ACTION IN REGARD TO THEIR EMPLOYMENT EDUCATION OR OTHER BENEFITS AS A CONSEQUENCE. AND THAT ARE IN COOPERATION WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP PROTOCOLS AND DECISION TREES GOT THIS CANNABIS AND CANNABINOID ADMINISTRATION BASED ON THE EMERGING SCIENCE I'M I'D SAY WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD ALREADY ON THEM. FINAL THAT EMPLOYERS AND THOSE IN CHARGE OF EDUCATIONAL ISSUE. SHOULD RECEIVE INFORMATION ON HOW TO ACCOMMODATE EMPLOYEE STUDENTS WITH WOULD THAT NEEDS FOR MEDICINAL CANNABIS IN THEIR PLACES OF. SPECIFICALLY EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS WHO RECEIVE A DISCOUNT SHOULD NOT BE JUDGED TO BE IMPAIRED OR UNQUALIFIED BASED ONLY ON CHEMICAL TESTS. BUT INSTEAD SHOULD BE EVALUATED BASED ON BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENTS THAT ARE RELEVANT TO THEIR OCCUPATION BE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE DO WITH AIRLINE PILOTS FOR EXAMPLE. WE TEST WHETHER THEY CAN ACTUALLY DO THE JOB. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION ONE ZERO THANK YOU MISTER GRANT AND I WANT TO WELCOME SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT TO SEE YOU TODAY. IT MAY BE THE ORDER TO DO WELL. BEFORE WE GO ON A JUST. A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND COMPARE THE MIND IN A- NOTICE THE TERM I HAVE A- ARTICLE FROM COVENTRY REGENERATIVE. AT THE COMPANY I GET RID OF THE NATION OF THAT NATURE TALK. THIS IN THE TREATMENT OF SOME DIFFERENT. ELEMENTS TALKS ABOUT THE NEUROPATHIC PAIN AND AN AGREED WITH THAT BUT I GUESS TO DO GOING TO YOUR POINT THAT A LOT OF THIS IS STILL UNCLEAR. TO SOME OF THE BENEFITS EIGHT. STATE THAT THERE ARE. SURE WELL CANNELLA WOODS- IS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS RELATED TREMORS AND THAT SO IT WOULD I GUESS WHAT I'M IN OF THE TAKE AWAY FOR ME ISN'T THERE STILL SOME CONTROVERSY OR DISCUSSION FOR WHAT ACTUAL OR DERIVED FROM SOME OF THESE CANNABIS PRODUCTS AND I THINK YOU SURE YOU MENTIONED THAT IN YOUR- YOUR PRESENTATION. THAT'S CORRECT THE FIELD IS THE- I THINK THE- AS OF ABOUT A YEAR AGO THE MOST AUTHORITATIVE DOCUMENT IS THIS NATIONAL ACADEMIES REPORT BUT AS THEY SAY IT'S THOUSANDS OF PAGE ACTUALLY BUT IT'S ALSO SUMMARIZED IN IN IN VERY NICE ABSTRACT THAT EACH SECTION. AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT FOR NEUROPATHIC PAIN AND FOR MUST PULL. SPASTICITY I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY MEAN BY TREMORS THAT'S ANOTHER SITUATION WHETHER OF TREMORS ARE BENEFIT I DON'T I DON'T THINK THAT'S BEEN STUDIED SUFFICIENTLY BUT FOR SPASTICITY MASS THERE'S VERY GOOD EVIDENCE NOW I BELIEVE. WE ARE ACTUALLY CONDUCT. THE ON SOMETHING CALLED ESSENTIAL TREMOR WHICH IS A CONDITION. MAY AFFECT OLDER PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR ERROR A PRODUCT CONTAINING CB DE HELLO BUT IF THC IS BEING TESTED BY ONE ROGER SO WE MAY GET SOME MORE INFORMATION ON A LEASE THAT TYPE OF TREMOR. I THINK IN THE OTHER AREAS THE FIELD IS EVOLVING THAT'S TRUE. OF AND- MORE WELL WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT THE SCIENTISTS SAY MORE RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE DONE OF COURSE. NATURALLY. WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A I DIDN'T MEAN TO ABOUT FACE YOU'RE HERE YEAH AND DO YOU FEEL THAT THE OF UTILIZATION OF LOCAL MARIJUANA WITHIN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION TIM COULD REDUCE THE USE OF- IN PAIN KILLERS. YES. I THINK IT COULD AND IF IT THERE I THINK IT COULD I CAN SAY THAT WITH CERTAINTY. BUT CERTAINLY THE EVIDENCE. ALSO FROM PRICKLY WELL RESEARCH WITH ANIMAL TYPES OF DATA. SUGGEST THAT YOU COULD PROBABLY REDUCE. THE AMOUNT OF OPIOID PEOPLE NEED. AND A DOCTOR MARK WALLACE YOUR PAIN PROGRAM AT UC SAN DIEGO HAS SAID THAT. MANY PATIENTS HAVE SPONTANEOUSLY COME TO HIM HE IS A CHRONIC PAIN PROGRAM. WHO SAID YOU KNOW ONCE I STARTED YOU KNOW USING MARIJUANA I DON'T FEEL LIKE. IT SO THAT BEEN EVEN A SPONTANEOUS. A SCIENTIFIC OUT OF FORMAL STUDY BUT- I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY A THERE THERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHICH I APPRECIATE THAT TO AND THE TESTIMONY IS VERY HELPFUL OKAY. WHICH YOU'RE WELCOME. ALLEN GOOD AFTERNOON. DIRECTED DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA NORMAL I AM. A LOT OF THE TREE HERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR HILL SENATOR MITCHELL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY YES MY NAME IS OWN COMBINE THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA NORMAL WHICH IS THE STATE CHAPTER OF THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR THE REFORM OF MARIJUANA LAWS WE ARE A NON PROFIT MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION THAT HAS ADVOCATED FOR CANNABIS CONSUMERS AND EVIDENCE BASED POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY. TWO. EVEN THOUGH CANNABIS IS NOW LEGAL FOR ADULT USE AND HAS BEEN LEGAL FOR MEDICAL USE SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX IN CALIFORNIA. WORKERS IN OUR STATE CAN STILL BE FIRED OR DENIED EMPLOYMENT FOR TESTING POSITIVE FOR CANNABIS. EVEN IF THEY USED IT DAYS BEFORE OR NEED TO TREAT A SERIOUS ILLNESS. THE RESULT IS TO UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST QUALIFIED WORKERS DENY THE MEDICAL TREATMENT WITH CANNABIS AND OFTENTIMES COMPELLED TO DEPEND ON OPIATES OR MORE HAZARDOUS DRUGS. IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT RULED THAT MEDICAL MARIJUANA USE IS NOT PROTECTED UNDER THE STATE'S FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HELP ACTOR FEE HA. THE LEGISLATURE RESPONDED BY PASSING A BILL TO REVERSE THIS DECISION BUT IT WAS VETOED BY GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER. PROP SIXTY FOUR BY CALIFORNIA VOTERS IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TO LEGALIZED THE ADULT USE OF CANNABIS DID NOT PROTECT EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS OF RECREATION. MEDICAL CANNABIS USERS. LAST YEAR A BILL WAS INTRODUCED IN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD HAVE PROTECTED THE RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES USING MEDICAL CANNABIS. BUT IT DID NOT ADVANCE. CAL NORMAL HAS HER COUNTY SAID REPORTS OF MEDICAL USERS WHO HAVE BEEN FIRED OR DENIED EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE THEY TESTED POSITIVE FOR MARIJUANA AND MANY SAY THEY HAVE HAD TO INCREASE THEIR USE OF OPIATES OR OTHER MEDICATIONS BECAUSE OF DRUG TESTING POLICIES. CALIFORNIA LAGS BEHIND OTHER STATES ON THIS IMPORTANT HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUE SIXTEEN OTHER STATES AND WASHINGTON DC HAVE ENACTED STATUTES PROTECTING QUALIFIED MEDICAL CAN OF. SERVERS FROM WORKPLACE DISK NATION YOU CAN SEE THE STATE'S ON THE MAP AND BY THE WAY THEY INCLUDE ARKANSAS OKLAHOMA WEST VIRGINIA CURRENTLY MORE PROGRESSIVE IN CALIFORNIA. ADDITIONALLY STATE COURTS IN SIX STATES HAVE OW RULED THAT MEDICAL CANNABIS USERS CANNOT BE FIRED OR DENIED EMPLOYMENT FOR OFF THE JOB CANNABIS USE OR FAILING TO PASS THE- EMPLOYMENT DRUG SCREEN. SIMILARLY COURTS ARE BEGINNING TO RULE FAVORABLY REGARDING WORKERS COMPENSATION AND CANNABIS. A GREAT MANY STUDIES LOOKING AT THE RENTAL OF AT LEAST TWENTY THOUSAND STUDIES ON CANNABIS A GREAT MANY HAVE SHOWN CANNABIS IS OF TO FOR PAIN AND CAN ALLOW PATIENTS TO REDUCE USE OF OPIATES YET CALIFORNIA IS NOT ALLOW FOR CANNABIS AS A CHRONIC PAIN TREATMENT FOR. WORKERS COMPENSATION. RECENTLY THE STATE OF MAINE AND THE VATA AND NEW YORK CITY HAVE MOVED TO PROTECT THE EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS OF THE ATION- CANNABIS USERS. AGAINST PRE EMPLOYMENT DRUG SCREEN. CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE CURRENTLY ALLOWS EMPLOYEE CLAIMS FOR QUOTE JUST CHARGE FOR. MEANT FOR LAWFUL CONDUCT OCCURRING DURING NON WORKING HOURS AND QUOTE. THIS MAY BE UP ONLY ONCE FEDERAL LAW CHANGES. I WANTED TO PUT AN ELEPHANT ON THE SLIDE BUT- THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM THE FEDERAL LAW. ALL THIS STATE LEVEL PROGRESSES HAPPENED DESPITE FEDERAL GENUINE TO KEEP BOTH MEDICAL AND RECREATIONAL MARIJUANA ILLEGAL. FEDERAL LAW MANDATES RANDOM URINE TESTING WITH NO EXCEPTIONS FOR MARIJUANA FOR SAFETY SENSITIVE POSITIONS LIKE TRUCK IN SCHOOL DRIVERS AN-AIRLINE PILOTS. IN ADDITION CERTAIN FEDERAL GRANTEES ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A DRUG FREE WORKPLACE. ALL THE STATE LAWS I HAVE MENTIONED AND THE EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS LAWS WE ARE PROPOSING IN CALIFORNIA EXEMPT EMPLOYERS WHO ARE SUBJECT. AND DATES SO THAT THEY DON'T USE FEDERAL CIRCUIT LOSE FEDERAL CERTIFICATION OR FUNDING. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT URINE SCREENS FOR MARIJUANA IN NO WAY MEASURE ACTUAL JOB FITNESS OR IMPAIRMENT. THIS IS BECAUSE THEY DETECT NON ACTIVE METABOLITES THAT RESIDE IN THE SYSTEM FOR DAYS OR WEEKS AFTER USE. NOT A SINGLE CONTROLLED FTA STUDY HAS EVER SHOWN THAT URINALYSIS IS EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING. SAFETY. IN GENERAL STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT ALLOW LEGAL USE OF MARIJUANA TEND TO HAVE LOWER RATES OF WORKPLACE FATALITIES THAN PROHIBITIONISTS STATES. SCIENTIFIC REVIEWS HAVE NOT FOUND ANY GOOD EVIDENCE THE CANNABIS IS ASSOCIATE PATIENT- INJURIES AND STUDIES HAVE EVEN SUGGESTED THAT WORKERS WHO TESTED POSITIVE CANNABIS WERE LESS LIKELY TO BE INVOLVED IN WORKPLACE ACCIDENTS OF A TOP. THEN THOSE WHO TESTED DRUG FREE. BETTER LTERNATIVES URINE TESTING EXISTS FOR JOBS INVOLVING HIGHLY ST CENTURY LIVES SITUATIONS. SUCH TESTS HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF DETECTING IMPAIRMENT DUE TO ANY SOURCE BE IT CANNABIS DRUGS FATIGUE OR MEDICAL FACTORS. COMPANIES THAT SWITCHED TO THIS KIND OF TESTING HAVE. LOWER WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS AND INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY. ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE TO BURN TEST COULD BE ORAL BOB A BREATH TEST NOW UNDER DEVELOPMENT WHICH MAY BE ABLE TO NARROW DETECTION WINDOW TO WITHIN A FEW HOURS IS DR GRANT POINTED OUT THERE ARE SOME ISSUES WITH THAT CORRELATING THAT WITH IMPAIRMENT. OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT OPIOID EPIDEMIC. CALIFORNIA SHOULD EXTEND FEE HOW WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS TO GRANT MEDICAL CANNABIS PATIENTS THE SKIN RIGHTS TO REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION AS THOSE TAKING PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. WORKERS COMPENSATION LAWS AND REGULATIONS SHOULD BE AMENDED TO ALLOW CAN FOR CHRONIC PAIN TREATMENT AND IF POSSIBLE CON PATIENTS FOR COSTS OF MEDICAL CANNABIS. THE CALIFORNIA SHOULD ALSO BàN URINE TESTING OR TESTING FOR INACTIVE METABOLITES FOR CANNABIS AND RANDOM OR PRE EMPLOYMENT DRUG SCREENS IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE. EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL LAW. WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE AND DEVELOP PERFORMANCE TESTING AND POSSIBLY ORAL. REST TESTING OF THE ALTERNATIVES FOR SAFETY SENSE SESSIONS. SO THIS IS A VERY. FOR MUCH A SUMMARY OF THE DATA I HAVE I A ARE ALSO ALWAYS AVAILABLE FOR CONSULTATION ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ME. VERY INFORMATIVE THE YES THE. THE MAIN TAKE AWAY FOR ME IS OR THERE'S. NO SOLUTION. IS GREAT IS THE SOLUTION FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHANGING THEIR POLICIES AND. FOR CALLING FOR ANY THIS ITS TRUE L. ACROSS THE BOARD IN. I WANNA SURE. YOU KNOW OF THE STATE'S OF THE LABORATORIES OF DEMOCRACY RIGHT NOW A LOT OF STATES ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH IT AND WITHOUT THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE STUDY SO FAR. AND YOU SEE THAT THE TESTING. THE WORKPLACE TESTING LIKE A- AND I'M NOT AWARE OF THE- THE CHALLENGES THAT EMPLOYEES ARE FACED WITH- AND HAVE BEEN IN THE STRUGGLES THAT THEY IN THE STATISTICS CERTAINLY POINT THAT OUT. HAVE YOU FOUND THAT THE. USE OF THAT OF TESTING AND THERE IS A WAY OF TESTING THAT DISH THE WITH THE SWAB AND THE BLOOD WHATEVER IS THE SWAB TEST WHICH WOULD INDICATE THE THC LEVELS RATHER THAN THE- LONG TERM. TWO WEEKS AFTER- AND YOU CAN TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE TWO YEAH THIS IS A SHOWN PROMISE IT POSSIBLE. TO DO THAT BUT- DR GRANT POINTS OUT IN THE STUDIES ARE BEING YOU KNOW DEPENDING PERSONS. THE AIR WAS CANNABIS AND STUFF IN THE DISTANCE THAT THEY'RE USING AND STUFF IT MIGHT NOT ACTUALLY CORRESPOND TO THEIR IMPAIRMENT IT ALSO DOESN'T WORK IF YOU TAKE IT ORALLY. IRONICALLY YOU'RE NOT GETTING THE SMOKE IN YOUR MOUTH SO- WITH REALLY THINK FOCUS SHOULD BE ON PERFORMANCE TESTING OR THE TYPE OF YOU KNOW WHAT THE AIRLINE PILOTS DO IS DR GRANT SAID BECAUSE AGAIN THAT COULD PICK UP YOU MIGHT BE OF FIFTEEN YOU MIGHT BE EMOTIONALLY STRESSED AND SO IF THE CONCERN IS ACTUALLY WORKPLACE SAFETY. THEN WE OUGHT TO BE LOOKING AT PERFORMANCE TESTING INSTEAD OF CHEMICAL TESTING. VERY GOOD INTERESTING. DO I FOR YOUR PREVIOUS FIVE AS I SIT HERE IN AND SEND TO YOUR RESPONSE TO SENATOR HILL YOU KNOW I WONDER SENATOR HE'LL IT THIS REALLY IS A CULTURAL ISSUE AROUND I'M BIASED AGAINST THE PRODUCT FUNDAMENTALLY. YOU I MEAN BECAUSE I MEAN WE CAN I WANTED TO LOOK AT YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS AGAIN BUT I WONDER IF IT'S. HI IF WILL EVER GET THERE IF WE CAN CAN YOUTO A TO A TECH TO ATTACK. APPROACH FROM RATIONAL PERSPECTIVE BUT IS IT REALLY JUST A FUNDAENTALLY A FUNDAMENTAL CULTURE SHIA- WHERE THERE'S A BIAS AGAINST THE PRODUCT YOU KNOW AS OPPOSED TO UNFORTUNATELY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THAT CAN HAVE MUCH MORE VERSE IMPACT IN THE HISTORIC BUT AT HIS DOOR. HOLD TWO MEN AND ALCOHOL AND WELL YOU KNOW ALL TRULY. ALCOHOL GROUP ALL THOSE ARE DEEMED ACCEPTABLE. USING THE TERM LOOSELY- BUT I GUESS I JUST IT MAKES ME AS I LISTEN TO THE RATIONALE INTER LIKE YOU SAID THAT THAT THAT IF THE IF THE CONCERN IS LEGITIMATELY SAFETY. THE TEST WERE TESTING FOR THE WRONG THING YES I THINK IT'S GIVE EMPLOYERS SOMETIMES A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY BECAUSE THERE. IMPAIRMENT IT'S NOT A GOOD WAY TO. FIFTY IT'S JUST A GREAT WAY TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE WHO WANT TO USE MARIJUANA ON THE WEEKENDS INSTEAD OF SOME. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE THAT THAT WAS WONDERFUL. NOW GO TO PANEL NUMBER TWO CAN OF INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS MORGAN LOCAL EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF REGULATORY AFFAIRS FOR MAD MEN. IN LINDSEY ROBINSON DIRECT CALIFORNIA CANNABIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION.

DIVERSE WORKFORCE IT MEANT TO SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND HOW WE APPROACH CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF. THE HARMS WARRANT DRUGS IS THIS. THEY HAD ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WE ARE PROUD OF OUR PARTNERSHIPS COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH THE UNITED FOOD AND COMMERCIAL WORKERS UNION MADE PARTNERS WITH UFCW TO RAISE STAND WORKERS OF US THE INDUSTRY AND TO SET THE GOLD STANDARD FOR WORKERS RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS.

FOR SUPPLY CHAIN A RESUME AND INTERVIEW SKILLS BUILDING WORKSHOP. AND A QUESTION ANSWER PANEL CONVERSATION WITH MANAGEMENT EXECUTIVES. DURING WITH BROTHERHOOD CRUSADE LOUD MAD MEN TO REACH OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AND HELP PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK IN THE MERGING CANNABIS INDUSTRY. IN OCTOBER. CULTIVATED A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP IN MASSACHUSETTS WITH THE MASSACHUSETTS ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES MASSACHUSETTS STATE WERE MADE OF CHINA TYLER ROXBURY COMMUNITY CALLED GREATER BOSTON LEGAL SERVICES THE URBAN LEAGUE AND THE STATE MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARY ASSOCIATION TOGETHER WE CREATED A WORK FORCE CONTINUING PROGRAM WHERE A COHORT OF INDIVIDUAL IMPACTED BY THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM CAN ENROLL IN A CANNABIS CERTIFICATION COURSE AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE. YOUR RECORD EXPUNGED A RE CLASSIFIED AND THEN BE PLACED INTO A PAID INTERNSHIP WITH DIFFERENT CANNABIS COMPANIES LIKE MAD MEN ALL TO ENSURE THAT NEW CANNABIS INDUSTRY FLEX THE DIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AND BOUGHT COMMUNITIES WE WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLEMENT SIMILAR. IN CALIFORNIA. HAVING TO OUR AFTER BROWN COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND SOCIAL EQUITY WE'RE BUILDING MADMEN NEXT. DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THE TRAINING OF SOCIAL EQUITY ENTREPRENEURS IN THE INDUSTRY. I'VE WRITTEN A TEN WEEK SOCIAL EQUITY BUSINESS OWNERSHIP CORPUS THAT IS FREE. AS ASIAN THAT WANTS TO ADOPT IT AND WE'RE PACKAGING OUR PROPRIETARY MAD MEN RETAIL LEARNING MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE AND SHARING IT WITH CITIES REGULATORS AND NONPROFIT PARTNERS. THE GOAL IS TO ENTER HER PARTNERS TO THE MANY FACETS OF THE INDUSTRY SHOW THEM HOW TO TAKE A CANNABIS BUSINESS SUCCESSFUL AND PROFITABLE IN THIS HIGHLY REGULATED ONEROUS SPACE. MAD MEN REGULARLY PARTNER WITH NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. FOR PRIDE MONTH IN OUR CALIFORNIA'S FIRST WE DEDICATED A PORTION OF SALES TO A QUALITY CALIFORNIA. ALSO WORK WITH LOCAL CHARITIES IN VARIOUS CITIES IN WHICH OPERATE LIKE RISING SUN AND REFILL CALIFORNIA ONE ARCHIVES FOUNDATION IN WEST HOLLYWOOD CALIFORNIA. BILLS IN CULVER CITY CA. SOCIAL EQUITY ENTREPRENEURSHIP. I ALREADY FROM BATMAN GENERALLY WHEN DISCUSSING SOCIAL. THE SPACE THERE MUST BE A FOCUS ON CHIP AND- ACTED BY THE WAR ON DRUGS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE OWNERS IN THIS CANNABIS ECONOMY. THAT IS WHY WE'VE PARTNERED WITH SOCIAL EQUITY ENTREPRENEURS IN THREE CITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO AID THEM IN MY OWN RETAIL OPERATIONS AND TO GIVE THEM. TO CAPITAL. WE PRIDE OURSELVES IN THE PROGRAMS I JUST DESCRIBED AND WE APPRECIATE. LATER AND REGULATORY EIGHT THESE TO STRENGTHEN THE GOAL LICENSE CANNABIS MARKET AND LIMIT THE MARKET. ENSURING A WELL REGULATED LOT PLAYING FIELD FOR CANNABIS OPERATORS WILL ENSURE THAT COMPANIES LIKE MAD MEN CAN CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND. RAM STATION TODAY THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY AND FOR PROVIDING A VENUE TO THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY. THAT WAS. IN FOR. THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU'VE MISSED THE IN IN THE- IF YOUR SERVER INTELLIGENT VERY NICE THING. AB. THANK YOU HELLO IN SENATOR MITCHELL'S VERY NICE TO YOU THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY MY NAME IS AMY JENKINS I'M THE SENIOR POLICY DIRECTOR FOR THE CAL OF THIS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OR C. C. I. A. IN HERE. THEN TODAY I'M WE GET REGRET SHE CANNOT BE OR SHE HAS THE BILL AND YOU DO NOT WANT HER HERE. I'M. SO TO SEE IF YOU. I MEAN NOT FORTUNATELY NOT SO CCA'S MEMBERSHIP INCLUDES OVER FIVE CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES REPRESENTING. SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY BRANDS AND APPROXIMATELY FIFTEEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. DOESN'T RETAIN SEES THAT'S BEEN TO UNITE THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA BY ENHANCING PUBLIC AND CONSUMER SAFETY TING LEGACY BUSINESSES PROMOTING ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND ENCOURAGES INVESTMENTS AND INNOVATION. WE ARE VERY PROUD OF THE WORK WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED MUCH OF WHICH HAS BEEN DONE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE. UNLESS CALIFORNIA'S CANNABIS INDUSTRY CAN. SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE TO PROMOTE A THRIVING THE CANNABIS MARKET PLACE. AUSTIN TWENTY SIXTEEN WITH 57% OF THE VOTE PROP SIXTY FOUR LEGALIZED THE USE OF CANNABIS AND FINANCE FOR ADULTS. IT ALSO ENDED THE DECADES LONG HELD WERE ON DRUGS AND MADE IT MEANT TO ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL. MARKET. RESPONSE WHEN YOU COMPANIES EXPAND STAFF AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN PREPARATION TRANSITION OF CUSTOMERS TO THE REGULATED MARKET. IF THE PROMISE OF PROP SIXTY. NOT BEEN FULLY REAL THE VAST MAJORITY OF LEGAL BUSINESS. EMILY ST FORD AND TWENTY SIXTH IN UNANTICIPATED COMPLICATIONS ARE NOW. LEGAL CANNABIS BUSINESSES AND THREATENING THEIR ABILITY TO THRIVE SIMPLY STATION TOOK FULL EFFECT ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY SEEN SLOWER THAN EXPECTED GROWTH WITH THE CALIFORNIA MARKET PLACE LIKE MANY NEW LEADS LEGAL MARKETS REPEATEDLY MISSING REGULATORS AND ANALYSTS PROJECTIONS. MEANWHILE THE ILLICIT MARKET CONTINUES TO GROW. CENTRAL TO PROP SIXTY FOUR IS THE CONCEPT CONTROL WHICH EMPOWERS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO PERMIT OR BANNED COMMERCIAL CANNABIS. VOTERS ON WHERE THESE BUSINESSES MAY BE LOCATED WELL IT WAS EXPECTED TIME WOULD BE NEEDED FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES. CANNABIS ORDINANCE SAYS CURRENTLY LESS THAN 40% OF CALIFORNIA'S FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO IS AND FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ARE ALLOWING CAREER CANNABIS ARE. IN THERE. OF THIS FOR OF THIS 40% MANY ARE LIMITED TO ONLY CERTAIN BUSINESSES. BY CHANGE IN FACT ONLY ABOUT ONE IN FOUR JURISDICTIONS ALLOW FOR RETAIL STORE. RESULT VOTERS LACK ACCESS TO THE LEAVE OUT OF THIS MARKET PLACE STATEWIDE IT MEANT AS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT DO DECIDE TO PERMIT COMMERCIAL CANNABIS ACT THESE IMPOSE UNTENABLE RESTRICTIONS ON THOSE BUSINESSES OR GREATLY LIMIT AVAILABLE REAL ESTATE FOR CANNABIS BUSINESSES TO A STOP. PLEASE THERE ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANT TAX BURDEN BIRD WITH THE COMBINATION OF STATE THE BEST TAXES THE IMPOSITION OF LOCAL TAXES OF THAT'S WERE SET ON STATE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN CHOOSE TO TAX THIS BUSINESSES AS MUCH AS THEY WANT AND THEY DO. AS A RESULT TAXES ON PRODUCTS CAN CONFOUND COMPOUND TO UPWARDS OF 50% IN SOME JURISDICTIONS. THIS TRANSLATES TO A MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA CANNABIS REMAINING IN THE ILLICIT MARKET UNDERCUTTING THE PRICES OF THE REGULAR MARKET AND CHANGING ENDANGERING CONSUMER AND WORKER SAFETY. ALLOWING BUSINESSES TO OPERATE WITHOUT REGULATIONS TAXES TESTING OR ACCOUNTABILITY WELL DELETED COME IT'S PAY AS MUCH AS 50% IN TAXES PLUS ONEROUS. COMPLIANCE FEES MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE. THIS IS TO COMPETE THE RESULT IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO PUSH MORE CUSTOMERS INTO THE ILLICIT GET WE CAN ALSO ASSUME THAT A LISTEN OPERATORS DO NOT MAINTAIN WORK. INSURANCE PAM PLYMOUTH TAX WERE PROVIDE HEALTH RETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFITS THUS DENYING WORKERS THE PAY AND BENEFITS AFFORDED TO EMPLOYEES WORKING AND. MOREOVER THESE OPERATIONS OFTEN MISCLASSIFIED. AS A RESULT ARE LIKELY UNDERPAYING WORK FOR THEIR LABOR. ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY AR FEW AND BDS X. 80% OF THE CANNABIS MARKET AND CALIFORNIA REMAINS. THE SAME REPORT FOUND. LEGAL MARKET POSTED REVENUES OF TWO POINT FIVE BILLION LAST YEAR THE MARKET SIZE UP TECH AS GROWING TO EIGHT SEVEN BILLION. EVEN WITH ALL THESE DIFFICULTIES AND WHILE THE ILLICIT MARKET CONTINUED POSE A SIGNIFICANT SHALL. TO THE REGULATED INDUSTRY STILL REMAIN HOPE THESE CHALLENGES OBSTACLES ARE SHORT TERM APPROPRIATE AND FOR TEN BY REGULATORS. EFFORTS BY ESSENCE BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE. HIGH QUALITY ULTIMATELY DRIVE LONG TERM GROWTH FOR THE REGULATED AND THREE. IN FACT MANY COMPANIES ARE MAKE ADJUSTMENTS NOW ME INDUSTRY A LACK OF THAT'S OFTEN LEADS TO EMPLOY A ROLL BACKS UNFORTUNATELY THIS HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY NECESSARY. INDUSTRY AS THEY'RE TRYING TO STOP THE LEGAL MARKET. THE BUSINESS DAILY PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE IN OF FOR SIX ABOUT THE GROWING TREND OF EMPLOYEE LAYOFFS SINCE OCTOBER. IS DECISIONS ARE FALL THEY ELIMINATE THE IMPERATIVE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE ILLICIT OPERATORS AND THEIR CUSTOMERS TO JOIN THE REGULATED MARKET. IT IS TIME TO CREATE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR BUSINESSES THAT INVESTED IN THE PROMISE OF LEGALIZATION AND XIN. ON TOP OF THESE FINANCIAL BURDENS CANNABIS OPERATORS ARE ALSO AT A DISADVANTAGE DUE TO THE LACK OF BANKING ACCESS THIS MAKES COMMON BUSINESS PRACTICES SUCH AS PROCESSING PAYROLL AND PAYROLL TAXES UNNECESSARILY COMPLICATED. AND I WANT TO THANK BOTH SENATE ONE SHERMAN HELL FOR SUPPORTING A LOT OF THE BANKING REFORM EFFORTS THAT WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO PURSUE IN THE LEGISLATURE. THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY REMAINS COMMITTED TO REDUCING BARRIERS. PUTTING BARRIERS TO CALM AND PROMOTING FAIR EQUITABLE THRIVING AS A THRIVING INDUSTRY. TOWARDS TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO ADVANCE POLICIES THAT PROMOTE SOCIAL ACT AND THE WORK FORCE. MANY LOCUSTS JUST LEARN. MANY LOCAL TERRACE DIGS ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM THE STATE HAVE ALREADY BEGUN. THING OUT EQUITY PROGRAMS TO- THAT THOSE MOST OF DEAD BY THE WAR ON DRUGS BENEFIT FROM THE NEW OPPORTUNITIES THE LEGAL INDUSTRY. AT THE SAME TIME WE URGE THE LEGISLATURE TO OPPOSE POLICIES THAT IMPOSE NEW REGULATORY BURDENS ON OUR INDUSTRY OR TREE CAM APPLICANTS AND BUSINESSES DIFFERENT OTHER INDUSTRIES LICENSED BY THE STATE. SUCH POLICIES RUN COUNTER TO CALIFORNIA'S GOAL OF DE STIGMATIZE. IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY WHICH IS ALREADY MADE NUMEROUS CONCESSIONS IN AN EFFORT TO BE LIGHT AND REGULATED LIKE ANY OTHER BUSINESS. IN CLOSING THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY LOOKS FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED. WE HAVE. AS WELL AS WITH LABOR PATIENT SIMMER GROUPS TO FORTIFY THE REGULATED MARKET WITH YOUR HELP WE CAN AND WILL ELIMINATE THE ILLICIT MARK. PROTECTED GOOD PAYING JOBS REDUCE TAXES TECH CAN SEE HEALTH AND SAFETY AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING CCH TESTIFIED. I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THAT THAN THAT. IT WAS VERY INTERESTING IN FACT. WHICH IS THE ONE THAT I HAVE IT OVER. FOLLOW FOR A LITTLE WHILE WITH THANK YOU HOW ARE YOU THANK. SENATE MITCHELL FOR HAVING YESTERDAY HONOR TO BE HERE IT'S A GREAT TOPIC AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING HEARING IN THE FIRST PL. RESIDENTS IN BEING AN SPENDING THE TIME WITH. PLACE I GET MY NAME ERIC SKLAR I'M THIS FOUNDER AND CEO OF THROUGH THE RIVER ECKLEY ANYBODY CAMPUS COMPANY LOCATED IN NAPA VALLEY. I'M ALSO REQUIRED TO MENTION ANOTHER HAD I WHERE I'M PRESENTLY THE PRESS. GAME COMMISSION. AND MY COUNSEL ON THE CAN AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR VOTE ON THE RULES COMMITTEE CAN FOR MANY YEARS AGO. THE CARD DAYS MISSION I'M HERE AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN IN HERE ON BEHALF OF MY COMPANY NOT REPRESENTATION IN COMMISSION. MY COMPANY IS A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED CANNABIS COMPANY THAT MEANS WE DO EVERYTHING FROM CULTIVATION. THROUGH CREATING BRANDS THAT END UP ON A IN IN CONSUMERS HOUSES AND ON. AND IN THEIR HANDS I'M WE DO EVERYTHING BETWEEN INCLUDING MANUFACTURING DISTRIBUTION. AND WE'RE ACTUALLY JUST A DELIVERY SERVICE FOR THE MOST OF THE NORTH BAY SAN FRANCISCO UNDER THE EASE BANNER. THE BIG DELIVERY COMPANY WE DELIVER TO MARIN. NAPA SOLANO COUNTIES. WE WANT TO. DO THIS OFTEN WHETHER IT'S ON THIS MY LAKE ISSUES OR IN CANADA- I HAVE SOME TO COMPLAIN ABOUT. OR SOMETHING THAT I MET YOU KNOW ASKING FOR- I AMY AND MORE. GOOD JOB OF COVERING THE TOPICS I'M ACTUALLY HERE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT FIRST. BUT WITH WORKING. RIGHT AS A- WONDERFUL THING. SO OUR COMPANY LIKE. THAT WHICH- IS GREATER WITH MORGAN. CAM WITH THE COMPANY'S DOING TERRIFIC WORK THEY'RE DOING WE ARE A. LIKE EVERYBODY EVERY RATE REGULATED CANNABIS COMPANY. L. P. A.'S. THE UFCW WITH THE TEAMSTERS THE UFCW FOR OUR DELIVERY SERVICE AND THE TEAMSTERS FOR CULTIVATION SITES WE JUST HAD OUR- BARGAINING AT THE GROCERY. TUESDAY WITH THE U. S. E. W. WELL. WE ARE WE THINK THAT THAT'S THE ALL BUSINESS SHOULD OPERATE THAT WAY. BECAUSE REQUIRED AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN IT ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE DONE TO EMPLOYEES AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT- THAT IT IS RIGHT TO GET A- HOT NOT PAYING THE FARE COMPLAIN THE TAXES AND BENEFITS THAT THAT THE KING WORKERS. SUBJECT AT TO MISSING- AND SO EVEN IF. THE W. TO LAW THE STATE WE WOULD BE DOING THAT. BUT WE THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD RULE FOR OUR INDUSTRY. FOR ALL THE MYSTERIES AND WE SUPPORT ANY EFFORT TO MAKE IT. WILL PLAYING FIELD. THE SAME GOES FOR THE WORK WITH WHAT WITH THE UNIT. IS MY ALL OUT. BUSINESSES SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SIGN- DAYS WHEN THERE'S CERTAIN SIDE. WE FOUND OUR FIRST WOMAN OUR FIRST COMPANY BECAME TED TWENTY EMPLOYEES WHICH IS WHAT REQUIRED. BUT OUR SECOND COMPARE CULTIVATION COMPANY WE SIGNED WITH THE TEAMSTERS BEFORE THAT. ON BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S THE RIGHT. FUNDAMENTALLY WE NEED TO HAVE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. I'M IT'S NOT LEVEL NOW UNDERSTANDABLE IT'S AN. BIG THING TO PASS PROP SIXTY FOUR IN TO DO THAT WITH THERE HAD TO BE THINGS IN THAT WERE NEXT. TO PROBABLY GET A PASS. ON STATE MAYBE MORE. WE'RE CENTRAL ANY REALLY TALKED. AT LENGTH IN WELL ABOUT. THE ISSUE OF LOCAL CONTROL THE LITTLE IT IS THE BIGGEST THREAT NOW. EXPERIMENT CANNABIS BUT IS TO WORKERS THOSE WORKERS AREN'T PART OF A UNION THERE ARE THAT OPPORTUNITY THEY DON'T GET BENEFITS THEY'RE BY DEFINITION GIG WORKERS THEY DON'T HAVE WITH WHOLE WITHHOLDINGS TAKEN CARE OF FOR THEM. A REAL DISADVANTAGE JUST ON THAT FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE BUT. SAFETY I'M WORKING THOSE ILLEGAL BUSINESSES ARE OVERALL FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IS TO HANDLE ILLEGAL MARKET THAT'S WHAT AND THE PROBLEM IS ABOUT HAVE IT ALL THE REGULATED. THAN THAT WE OUGHT TO HAVE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WHERE CANNABIS BUSINESSES THAT HAVE A HARDER TIME. YES WHEN I. WE SHOULD HAVE BURDENS PUT ON US THAT ON ON OTHER BUSINESSES THAT ARE THAT ARE LEGAL AND LEGITIMATE AS WELL. AND THAT WILL HELP THE STIGMA ATTACHED TO STIGMATIZE INDUSTRY AS WE TALK ABOUT IN SOME OF THE EARLIER COMMENTS TODAY. SO IMPORTANT. I DO THINK IS RUSHING TO THE PRESENTATION FROM NORMAL. WE HAVE A DELIVERY BUSINESS WE HAVE WE'VE CREATED I THINK SIXTY. JOBS IN LAKE COUNTY. I'M THE POOL WANTED TO POOREST COUNTY IN THE STATE IN THE LAST SEVENTEEN MONTHS. THOSE PEOPLE ARE DRIVERS DELIVERING CANNABIS PRODUCTS SOME. AN APPROPRIATE TREATMENT FOR THOSE IN AND TO BE CVD WERE HAS NO IMPACT ON THEIR DRIVING ABILITY BECAUSE OF THE LACK RESEARCH AND BECAUSE OF CURRENT LAW WE HAVE TO SEVEN ZERO EIGHT ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY ON. CANNABIS USE I CAN'T. TWENTY SO IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO SOLVE I THINK ANYBODY IS TO BLAME FOR ITS REALITY THERE'S BEEN SO LITTLE RESEARCH PARTLY BECAUSE OF FEDERAL LAW MAKE. SO HARD TO FUND RESEARCH BUT THE STATE COULD REALLY BE A LEADER IN ADAM. ANY PRE ATION. HIS YOU KNOW HAPPENING AT THE THC IN YOUR BLOOD STREAM. BECAUSE IT REALLY IS A CHALLENGES WAS SO WELL DESCRIBED EARLIER SO WE YOU KNOW WE THANK YOU FOR THE WORK YOU'RE DOING THIS TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE. THE AFTER. FOR THIS INDUSTRY TO HELP BRING IT LIST LEGITIMIZATION AND. WE CAN AND THE ILLEGAL MARKET. WHICH IS BETTER FOR. FROM VITAMINS. BETTER FOR. CALIFORNIA SO AGAIN THANK YOU AND HAPPY THREE WHICH IS THE MAKERS WERE IN ENOUGH OF START WITH YOU TO DO. DO YOU SEE. THE FUTURE WE HAVE OF THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY IF YOU SEE IT. THE TAX ISSUE AND THE. CERTAINLY THOSE THAT ARE UP I'D OF THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT THAT WE HAVE TODAY YOU HAD OUT WOULD YOU SEE IT WHEN YOU SEE IT HE IS A SOLVING THESE PROBLEMS AND THIS IS IN IN ON THE SITUATION- BUT WELL I HOPE. SO I. AM NOT A STRATEGY ROOM BUT I. PEOPLE DEEPLY CAN. IS LATER I KNOW THE GOVERNOR'S COMMITTED TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS EXPERIMENT. AND THE INDUSTRY IS I THINK THE PEOPLE. WANT TO SEE THE SIXTY. SO I'M UP TO. WE PROBLEMS BUT HE THERE ARE PROBLEMS AND- AND WE NEED TO WALL WORK TOGETHER TO FIX THEM IF IS. EXCEED BECAUSE THERE'S STILL A POSSIBILITY. GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW THE RATIO OF ILLEGAL ILLEGAL MARKET. THERE'S STILL THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS EXPERIMENT FAILED. AND WE GO BACK TO. YOU KNOW ENTIRELY ILLEGAL MARKET NOW THE DISASTER. SO MANY REASONS. SO WHETHER ON. ON LOCAL ACCESS IS CRITICAL- AS LONG AS THERE'S ONLY FOUR HUNDRED SO DISPENSARIES IN THE STATE OF. THE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. PEOPLE GONNA GO DEAL. BECAUSE THE DOING FOREVER AND THE BAY PRICES WERE SAYING IS ALL ABOUT THAT. INJURY THAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE'S AN ILLEGAL MARKET. IN A WAY THAT IT WILL NOT HAPPEN IN A REGULATED MARKET ALL OF OUR- TEST TO A FARE THEE WELL. WHICH IS GREAT WE WANT. MORE SAFE. SO I THINK THAT THINGS LIKE LOCAL ACCESS. DOING SOMETHING TO. IT DEVICE WITH A CARROT AND STICK MAYBE LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO. DOING THEIR. JOB AND YOU KNOW WHEN YOU SLICE TO ALLOW THESE LEGITIMATE BUSINESS WEEK. EITHER ACTION OF. BEING ALONE LIMITED PROHIBITION. THIS EXAMPLE OF THE STATE. KAMALA CARROTS ARIVED THERE IS TAX MONEY AVAILABLE. TO ENCOURAGE LOCAL RACES I WOULD SAY THAT'S NUMBER ONE. IS GETTING MORE LEGAL BUSINESS. AND ACROSS THE STATE IN THIS IS THAT'S INTRODUCED A YEAR IN THE DELIVERY BUSINESSES WELL OF. THE IN THIS COSTA MY- IGNORANCE OF THE- TOPIC BUT IF I RECALL. THERE'S A BIG QUESTION NOW WHETHER YOU CAN DELIVER IN. HAVE AID THAT DECISION TO HAVE A RETAIL ESTABLISHMENT AND I BELIEVE THAT IN THE FORTUNE OUR HOUSE THAT IS IN THE COURSE OF IT STANDS AS THE STATE IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS HAD THAT I'M SURE THAT THE BCC AND THE- AND THE REGULATIONS. IF SINCE LIVE RECON. BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BRING LEGAL LICENSE PRODUCT TO ADULTS ARE YOU MAY DELIVER ANYWHERE IN THE STATE FROM YOUR LOCATION WHATEVER LOCALITY AND SO FOR INSTANCE AND THEY CAN. MAKE THEIR LACK. LIVING TO SEVEN COUNTIES FROM THAT ONE DEEP. NOT VERY EFFICIENT WE MUCH RATHER HAVE ONE IN SAUSALITO AND ONE IN YOU KNOW IN IN VACAVILLE BUT FOR NOW WE'RE DOING THAT. IT'S COLD OUTSIDE IN THE YOU CAN LIVE RESIDENT. BILLY A GROUP OF SEASONAL AND LEGAL CITIES HAVE SUED THE STATE. SITE IN POLICY IN THAT CASE THE PROCESS. OKAY THANK YOU. SO UP. TO THE ISSUE IT TO. THE TO THE THAT I KNOW AND THIS. WAS TALKING. ABOUT DO YOU ARE THERE OTHERS THAT. MR WE MAY HAVE MISSED IN THEIR- TO BE HELPFUL I THINK SHE REALLY CARED AT HOLISTICALLY OF COURSE THERE IS THE TENSION BETWEEN FEDERAL PROHIBITION AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN STATES I THINK WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF. ONLY MORE SO THAN WE'VE EVER SEEN OR ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF AND THE SAFE BANKING ACT AND DISCUSSION AROUND. NOTE THE SCHEDULE PLAYING FIRST SAYS JUST ACKNOWLEDGING STATES THAT HAVE LEGAL MARIJUANA Là AS AN CONSIDERING AT THE SCHEDULING IN THOSE STATES THROUGH THE STATE ACT OR HAVE SOCIAL EQUITY SHOULD BE A LEVEL. I'M AT AS WE CONTINUE TO SEE A SEA CHANGE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND MORE STATES COMING ON LINE IT ALSO HELPS. BEING OF FOLKS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL UNTIL. YOU KNOW THE CONTEMPORARY TIMES OF WE'RE SEEING IN CALIFORNIA BUT I THINK SHE APPROPRIATELY CAPTURED AT THING THERE DEFINITELY IS A TENSION BETWEEN THE ILLICIT MARKET AND A LEGAL ONE AND I THINK. IT'S A REAL CHALLENGE ESPECIALLY. THE HARMS THAT THE WAR ON DRUGS HAS HAD ON COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND BEING ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THE FOLKS WHO WANT TO MOVE INTO THE REGULATED INDUSTRY DO NOT HAVE BARRIERS TO DO SELL. DIFFERENT KINDS PROPOSED LEGISLATION THAT HAVE. REDUCED FEE. OR FEEL THE FIRST FOR PAUL TO COME INTO THE LEGAL REGULATED MARKET IMPORTANT. ALL AND THAT IS ALSO WHY MADMEN PUTS. MAD MEN NEXT. PROVIDING DIFFERENT KINDS OF CORRECT I'M IN TRAINING ABOUT HOW TO BE SICK THIS MARKET ESPECIALLY AS SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE THE ONLY WAY THAT. WELL AS IF THEY ARE NOT COMPETING AGAINST ELLISON. OTHER THING I WOULD ADD TO THAT IS IT FOR CONSUMERS TO DIFFERENTIATE BUT ILLICIT OPERATORS AND LEGAL REGULATED OPERATORS. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THEY LOOK VERY SIMILAR- AND SELL. DECISION AROUND AN EMBLEM PROGRAM OR JUST MORE EDUCATION TO CONSUMERS ABOUT HOW TO CHECK FOR WHAT IS POPULATED VERSUS NOT I THINK IT'S STILL NEEDED. HELP MAY MAY I DID TELL YOU KNOW A GOOD DEAL OF THE LEGAL COULD PRODUCTION OUR STATE ACTUALLY GOES OUT OF STATE TO AND SO THERE'S SOMETHING THAT THE STATE OVER OREGON PASSED A LAW THAT ALLOWS INTERSTATE SHIPPING BETWEEN TWO TO SEE. THE LIGHTS CAM IF THEY'RE CONTIGUOUS THERE'S A MOVIE UNDER WAY TO LOOK AT A FEDERAL KIND OF EITHER A COOPERATIVE AGREEMENT. BUT ALSO GET THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ALLOW SHIPPING ACROSS STATE LINES THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY ALSO. BECAUSE YOU CAN SHIP IT OUT OF STATE LEGALLY THEN WILL BE MORE INCENTIVE FOR THESE ILLEGAL ROLLERS TO GET IT. CAN TODAY SHIP FROM CANNOT YOU CAN ACHIEVE APPROXIMATELY I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE YEP FEDERAL BUT BUT THEORETICALLY IF I IF YOU RADICALLY IF THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE GOVERNOR SIGNED A BILL. THAT THAT WE WILL. BE ACROSS THE STATE LINE CONTINUOUS SAY TO ALLOW WASHINGTON OREGON. NEVADA ALL TO SHIP AMONG THEMSELVES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT BUT- IN THE END. THERE YOU'RE NOT CROSSING OF US AT THE US BORDER YOU'RE CROSSING STATE FOR FROM ONE STATE TO ANOTHER. TO THE SOME OF THE SOME. EL PASO SIMILAR LOT ORGANS. WE COULD START SHIPPING ACROSS A LEDGE WOULD BE GREAT FOR CALIFORNIA ECONOMY BECAUSE- JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER CROP CALIFORNIA'S BACK. GROWING AT THE MOST DAYS OUR WEATHER IS YOUR PERFECT GOING INTO THIS. I THINK WE CAN BE A LEADER IN CANADA'S PRESSURE CROSSING. ONCE WE CAN START. PROCESSING PLANT. AND I THINK THAT WILL HELP. YOU SEE NOT ILLEGAL GROWTH GROW GROWING THAT'S GOING ON. IN HIS MID MEN STILL. CALIFORNIA ARE YOU STILL IN. MORE IN CALIFORNIA AND SHE THE GROWTH POTENTIAL THERE ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC WE'RE INCREDIBLY OPTIMISTIC CALIFORNIA'S WHERE WE BUILT THIS IS WHERE WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A DEEP ROOTS. CAN YOU IT TO EXPAND OUR MARKET SO WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS OF APPLYING FOR DIFFERENT LICENSES IN CITIES THAT ARE COMING ONLINE AND PLOWING WHETHER IT IS A RETAIL BUSINESS OR EVEN DELIVERY DEPOT BECAUSE WE ALSO DO DELIVERY AT THE COMPANY. AND WILL ALWAYS HAVE CALIFORNIA'S PART OF OUR PORTFOLIO THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO US. THANK YOU. COM YOUR PRECIADO SIXTY MINUTES THAT A PIECE FULL SUNDAYS AGO- AND I WAS STRUCK BY THIS NOTION IN CALIFORNIA IS PUT IS NOT OVER PRODUCING. AND THE AND THE FOCUSED ON THE DESERT BE ABLE TO. YOU KNOW HOW. THE SOLUTION THERE DO WE DO WE SLOW DOWN PRODUCTION. ON THE OTHER CHALLENGES YOU EXPERIENCE WITH I MEAN THINK ABOUT OUR. HISTORIC AG. BUSINESS FOCUSES BEEN TO FEED THE WORLD OUR IT'S A BIT OF A TRANSITION. SO HOW DOES THE INDUSTRY JEFF OVER SOMEONE HOW TO SO. ALL CITY DEMAND WELL SO FIRST OF ALL AT THE END HELLO SIXTY MINUTES I THINK THEY GOT IT WRONG TO AGREE. WASTE AND IS TRYING TO. IN THE LEGAL MARKET I'M TO MY SURPRISE AND ENJOY AS AS A CANNABIS GROW OUR PRICES WITHOUT PRICES WERE GONNA STEADILY DECLINED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS THEY HAVE NOT THAT THE SAME POINT LAST YEAR- A POUND OF SUN GROWN CANNABIS FLOWER FROM LAKE COUNTY WERE WE GROW IS GOING FOR ABOUT NINE FIFTY DOLLARS IT'S GOING FOR TWO ELEVEN. AND THIS YEAR SO WITH THAT IN THE LEGAL MARKET THERE'S NOT ENOUGH SUPPLY AND THEY'RE IN AS A SUPPLY GRIST. OKAY TO BE MORE COMPETITION IS GOOD FOR CONSUMERS IF THE PRICE OF THE PRODUCT COMES DOWN BECAUSE AND RETAIL PRICES COME DOWN TO IT REALLY IS ABOUT THE ILLEGAL SIDE OF IT BECAUSE THOSE FOLKS NOW CAN'T SELL IT- AT DISPENSARIES THAT THEY MIGHT IT USED TO BE ABLE. TO MAKE BECAUSE BEFORE STE FOR. A GROWER. PROBABLY YOU KNOW THROUGH THROUGH SOME. SMOKE AND MIRRORS COULD GET INTO SPENCER'S AND NOW THIS IS VETERANS CANNOT TAKE THAT CANNABIS. UNLESS IT'S IN THE TRACKING FREE THEM IN A LICENSE GROWER IS GONE AND TAG IT WITH THE RADIO ID. ALL PLAN. SO THERE'S THIS IMBALANCE IN AGAIN IS THE BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LEAGUE. LEGAL MARKET. I'M COULD. COME THEY SHOULD NOT BE THE. GROW CANNABIS. CASES IN MAINE WHERE THEY HAVE TO DO IT IN THE- AND IT'S INCREDIBLY EXPEND. ENERGY EFFICIENT HOME WHEN WE- SIGNED GROWING UP FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY SO. IT'S A QUICK TO PROMISE THAT LACK OF A FEDERAL SYSTEM TO ALLOW IT IS WITH. TO GATHER BUT ILLEGAL BUT THERE'S NOT AN OVERSUPPLY IN STATES LIKE OREGON THERE'S A THEMATIC. THEY PASSED A LOT OF TO GO OUT ACROSS THE STATE HOPEFULLY OVER SOMETHING INTERESTING WHAT. I DON'T KNOW BUT SHE IS THERE HE'LL BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE SEE. MOVEMENT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL ANYTIME SOON. THERE'S A POTENTIAL CHANGE IN YOU KNOW LEADERSHIP IN TWENTY TWENTY I JUST DON'T KNOW THAT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL FOR YOU GIVEN THE COMPOSITION OF CONGRESS AT ALL- AND SO WILL THE BE ADJUSTMENTS MADE IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND WHAT COULD THEY LOOK LIKE YEAH YEAH SO AGAIN THERE HAVE HAVING INTERSTATE REMAIN. SHIPPING WOULD BE WOULD BE HUGE I DO I DO I'M A LITTLE MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE THINGS HAPPENING WATCHING I THINK THE IMPEACHMENT PROCESS HAS BOGGED DOWN AND WILL FOR AWHILE BUT THE STICK. THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES THIS SUMMER PASSED. WITH NIGHT. WELL DEMOCRAT ALMOST ALL THE DEMOCRATS. THE BANKING ACT WHICH IS THE FIRST STEP. CONNELL. OF IT AS IMPLICIT OTHERWISE. ON THE POPULATIONS THAT TO ME EIGHT IN THE SPACE AS WELL. THE PROGRAMS ARE IMPORTANT DEEPER MORE SYSTEMIC IT COMES WITH THE AROUND HOW COMMUNITIES OF COLOR POOR THEIR PERCEIVED THOSE WHO BEEN FORMER. TOUCHED BY THE BILL JUST ASSIST SO IT'S IMPORTANT WE PUSH THE EQUITY BUT WE CAN'T YOU KNOW A SO THAT WILL BE ENOUGH THE WE HAVE TO GO MUCH DEEPER IN TERMS OF KIND OF A CULTURE SHIFT AROUND. GET OUT EXPERIENCE BOTH COMMUNITIES HALF. PARTNERSHIP WITH BROTHERHOOD CRUSADE UNINTENDED THIS PROGRAM WAS YESTERDAY NO ONE DAY LATE I'M SORRY. THE BEEN SIMPLE TROUBLE ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT AGAIN AND ANOTHER ONE IN JANUARY. HALF OF THE COHORT THAT WAS THERE. BROTHER HAD AIDS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TRAINING WILL THEN WILL BRING THEM BACK AND DO A WHOLE HOST OF INTERVIEWS AGAIN. SO PLEASE MAKE SURE IT MIGHT JUST OFFICE KNOWS THAT BECAUSE WE WANT TO DEFINITELY PARTNER- SINCE WE HAVE THE PLEDGE OF REPRESENTING YOUR COVER CITY HEADQUARTERS YEAH WHICH I HAVE TO COME SEE I HAVE A LITTLE. TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN NOW I RECORD WITH. OR INTERNET SO. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHOEVER WANTS TO ANSWER YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE THAT MAY BE A RATHER SOFT TISSUE BUT AS AS WHEN I TRY TO WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND THIS YOU KNOW IS THE LACK OF BANKING IS AT THE BURKE. REGULATION OR IS IT. 60% OF LOCAL GOT THAT BASICALLY AREN'T. STEPPED UP TO THE. PLATE TO PLAY- WHAT'S THE BIGGEST. I WOULD I WOULD ARGUE SENATOR IT'S AS THE THIRD IT'S IF OF ACCESS TO LEGAL PRODUCT AND IS THAT IS THAT THEIR WAY OF AS WE GO. BACK CULTURE IS THEIR WAY OF. NOT SUPPORTING THE BALLOT INITIATIVE AND JUST NOT WANTING TO BE IN THE BUSINESS IS IT CONSTITUENT PRESSURE. LET A THIRD ELEMENT INTO THEIR COMMUNITY WHAT WHAT WHAT ARE WE HEARING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT IT'S FUNNY THE SICK AFTER FOR EXAMPLE. THE CITY MAP- PROP SIXTY FOUR PASSED THE STATE AVERAGE ON THAT TELEVISION. CANCEL THAT IS SEVEN IS PERSPECTIVE ON THIS I THINK IT'S- VERSION AMONG LOCAL OF. LOOK IN A MIRROR EVERY MORNING TEA AKON OUR STATE SENATOR. THEY DON'T DO ANYTHING IT MESSES UP THEY ONLY. TO GET ENOUGH. RIGHT IF THEY DO AND SO THE RISK ADVERSE THEY DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING. BASS PLAYER BECAUSE- THANKS AND THEY'RE AFRAID BECAUSE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT. THEY HAVEN'T SEEN IT OPERATE IT'S A NEW THING AND SO I THINK MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE YOU'LL FIND A LOT OF KIMI OPPOSITION WE WENT THERE HEARING. OFTEN IS LIKE A PARENTS GROUP IS CONCERNED ABOUT YOUTH AND THAT'S REALLY. WAS MAKE SURE THE KIDS DON'T MESS AROUND HERE WHY THEY SHOULD NOT BE USING IT IS BECAUSE IT'S WHETHER RANGER DEVELOPING. WHICH. REPRESENT OF THE POLICE ASSOCIATION IS YOURS IS AS HE ATE. AND I CAN EDUCATION GROUP. EVERYBODY ELSE AND WAS SUPPORTED AND THAT AND THE- COUNCIL MEMBERS WHO BUT YOU'RE STILL RESISTED. I THINK THAT'S THE BIGGEST THING. IS IT AND THEY DON'T HAVE ANY REAL INCENTIVE. RIGHT THERE THE PROBLEMS FROM THE ILLEGAL MARKET DON'T AFFECT THEM- AND DEATH. AND SO I THINK THAT THEY NEED TO BE A SET OF. POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE REWARDS FOR NOT JOB IN ALLOWING THE VOTERS TO HAVE WITH THEIR- OTHERWISE WHEN IS THE BALLOT ISSUE AFTER BALLOT INITIATIVE WHICH IS A TERRIBLE WAY TO LEGISLATE. YES. A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE IN TERMS OF THE. BIG ROLE YEAH I WOULD BE THAT IT'S DEFINITELY ABOUT A LACK OF ACCESS TO IN DIFFERENT CITIES I THINK. ANOTHER REASON WHY IS A CHALLENGE FOR CITIES TO. BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT MODELS OUT CALIFORNIA AND SO FOR THEM TO TAKE IT ON SEEING THAT SOME CITIES ARE MIRED IN LAWSUITS THROUGH THE- LOT COMPETITIVE LICENSING SSE IS THAT THEY HAVE O CREATE. AT TIMES AN ENTIRELY NEW DEPARTMENT AT THE CITY AND NEEDS TO BE. THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT FOR. IT'S NOT THE EASIEST THING TO EMPLOYMENT AS MIGHT BE VALLEY'S INTO RIGHT NOW SO I STUDENTS ABOUT THE- PROCESS IN THE AND HOW. LICENSES HAVE BEEN SELECTED YES AND I. A HAS DONE AN AMAZING JOB OF PUTTING TOGETHER MODEL LEGISLATION THE ORDINANCES ABOUT WHAT. A CITY CAN DEAL AND THE MORE EXAM. A PLUGIN PLAY GOLD STANDARD OF THIS IS HOW YOU SET IT UP ON THE BACK. CITIES PERHAPS THAT CAN. HELP EXPEDITE IT I ALSO REALLY THINK WE CAN IGNORE. THE LIMITED ACCESS TO CAPITAL IT IS REALLY HARD TO BUSINESS UP AND RUNNING AND TO ENSURE THAT BUSINESSES ARE SUCCESSFUL ESPECIALLY IN THE FIRST YEAR OF OPERATE. IF YOU DON'T HAVE STATE. BUT ALL IN THERE ARE A LOT OF FEAR. ACROSS THE BOARD SURE IF THAT ONE LAST QUESTION MAY THIRTY OF COURSE THE- PERCENT OF LOCAL. WHO ARE THE IS IF YOU CAN THESE ARE THESE ARE THE I. I THINK BY AND IT COUNTIES ARE ARE WE FOCUSED ON CULTIVATION. TEND TO AUTHORIZE AS MANY DIFFERENT COMMERCIAL CAMPUS ACTIVITIES I THINK NUMBERS CLEARLY CITIES OF THE WORST OFFENDERS WE OF FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO CITIES. ALL OF OUR OUR OUR RETAIL. WITHIN THE AS AN WITH ONE AND FOUR. THE CITY'S ACTUALLY THE RACING RETALIATING PARTICULAR PROBLEM AND I DO. IT'S MADE BY BOTH. BECAUSE I'M IN TERMS OF. ACCESS IT JUST MAKES ALL. THE ABILITY TO LICENSED HE'S IN EVERY COMMUNITY IT'S MUCH EASIER. ADDRESS THE ILLICIT MARKET RIGHT WHERE WE SAW ILLNESS AND WHERE WE HAVE YES THE VIENEN. AND EIGHTY COUNCIL WHERE THERE ARE THERE IS. SAFE COMPLIANCE PRODUCTS YEAH I JUST WANTED TO SAY TERRIBLY DIFFICULT ALL THE TIME YEAH WITH THE WITH THE SUPPLY BOUNCY SELF. ALLOW YOU KNOW CULTIVATION THAT'S OKAY WE'RE GONNA PUT ON THE BALLOT NOW. THAT THAT'LL HAPPEN HAS HAPPENED IS REALLY ABOUT THE RETAIL STORES DEALS GETS FIXED IF YOU WIND UP FOR THEM. AND IN TERMS OF. TALK ABOUT THE NUMBER OF CITIES BUT WE IN MY OWN KIND OF OFFENSE WHEN I COULD THROUGH THE NUMBER OF UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES. WHO. LOOK TO THE COUNTY THEIR GOVERNANCE THE NOT APPLE FIVE WHILE THERE ARE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES BUT IN TERMS OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES ARE UNDER. THAT NUMBER GO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER. INTERESTING AND AS WE TALK ABOUT SOCIAL EQUITY OWNERSHIP AND PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO APPLY WHEN THERE ARE CITIES. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES THAT IS A LEE ROLLING OUT THEIR NUMBER OF LICENSES IT IS A LIMITED NUMBER OF. THIS SO IF ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AND UNINCORPORATED AREAS IN LA COUNTY WERE OPEN UP AND ALLOW FOR LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES. THEN ALL OF THOSE FOLKS WHO DIDN'T MAKE THE FIRST. FOR EXAMPLE COULD THEN APPLY IN A NEARBY COMMUNITY. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE. HERE AT THE MONITOR. HELPFUL WILL MOVE ON TO THE THIRD PANEL EMPLOYER STAKEHOLDERS DRUG TESTING POLICIES AND FEDERAL COMPLIANCE ROBERT THREE POLICY ADVOCATE OF THE CALIFORNIA DRAPER IN RICE POLICY DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AT THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS KNOWLEDGES ASSOCIATION. HELLO NICOLE WELCOME. THANK YOU FOR A THIS WILL BE. INFORMATIVE TURN IN A RECOVERY. I'M WELL THANK YOU CHAIRMAN HILL PLEASE SO FIRST I HAVE T SAY THAT I THINK IT'S EVERYONE ACKNOWLEDGE THERE'S SOME. AS USUAL EXPRESSED WENT THROUGH THIS ISSUES RANGE FROM- EQUITY AND A LONG. WAR THANKS TO BANKING AND FEDERATION IS JUST A LOT HERE- AND OF COURSE- I CAN ONLY SPEAK TO A COUPLE OF THOSE ISSUES ON BEHALF OF CLICK ME RIGHT MANY OF THOSE THINGS. BY MAY HAVE PERSONAL SUBPLOTS THAT I WISH I COULD FIX. THERE BEYOND. SO LET'S SEE FIRST THE EMPLOYEE COMMITTEES GOALS ARE. ARE REALLY LIMITED HERE RIGHT AND IT'S- IT'S SAFETY AND THEN COMPLIANCE WITH BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE LAW SIMULTANEOUSLY- AND THAT'S THAT I DON'T THINK THAT'S PRICES ANYONE- AND- I. TO AGREE WITH MUCH OF WHAT WAS SAID BY THE SCIENTIFIC PANEL WE- THE BIGGEST ISSUE FOR US GOING THROUGH LOOKING ACROSS SIXTY FOUR IN AND MOVING TO THE PRESENT RIGHT. OUR ISSUES THAT ARE ONGOING WITH- THING RIGHT SCIENCE ABOUT IT WHEN WE HEARD AND- IT WAS EXPRESSED MUCH BETTER THAN THAT I COULD I DON'T KNOW IF NICOLE CAN DO BETTER. BUT ON THE ISSUES IMPROVE TESTING AS YOU ASKED ABOUT- SALIVA AND TEN THE BREATH TEST FUTURE. FOR A LOT OF PROMISE I'M THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE IT AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO US AND TESTING IS THE PRESENT TENSE WE HAVE A- PERFECT. RIGHT THE URINE TESTING IS NOT IDEAL- UNLIKE ALCOHOL WITH THE FERTILIZER TEST WE CAN BE PRETTY DECISIVE SAY. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW. THAT'S THAT- WE DON'T HAVE THAT HERE AND UNTIL WE HAVE A BETTER SYSTEM. THE FLAG MEETINGS IS VERY IMPORTANT. SOME WAY TO DO SOME TESTING AS A SAFETY CONCERN. SO TO GO THROUGH I WON'T GET INTO THAT OF ANY RESEARCH I DISCUSSED EARLIER WELL THAT. SOME OF THE SIDE EFFECTS OF MARIJUANA CAN TAKE- INCLUDE- IMPAIRMENT OF JUDGE A REACTION TIME ISSUES LIKE THAT RIGHT AGAIN. RESEARCH ON GOING CAMPUS THAT. WE HOPE FOR MORE. BUT PUTTING THAT IN CONTEXT RIGHT WITH THE FEDERAL PATIENTS IN SOMETHING IT WAS TOUCHED ON BRIEFLY I WANT TO EMPHASIZE ON THE SIDE RIGHT. THERE IS A THE FEDERAL ENFORCEMENT ISSUE WHICH HOPE BANKING LAW ME. IN THE CRIMINAL LAW HAS BEEN GENTLY FORCED- BUT BIGGEST CONCERN ON THE BUSINESS SIDE PROUDLY. FEDERAL CONTRACTING RIGHT AND GRANT RULES- AROUND A DRUG FREE WORKPLACE ISN'T AN ACT OF NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT RIGHT. I'M BECAUSE THE ISSUE FOR ANY EMPLOYER IN. THE WORKS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE DO ON OTHER FRONTS IF YOU WANT TO CONTINUE WORK WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT YOU'RE VERY CONSTRAINED ON THE FRONT SO THAT'S- THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE FOR A LOT OF BIG THIS IN CALIFORNIA. SO TRYING TO THAT CAN RESULT IN POSITION RIGHT THE RESULTING TO DIFFICULT POSITION WITH PRE EMPLOYMENT TESTING WHICH IS. YOU KNOW THE ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES. IS YOU KNOW WHAT DO YOU DO. THE THERE'S A REQUEST EARLIER BUT WHY I'M SORRY CAN A NAY BUT WHEN ISSUES IS WHAT DO YOU JUST SKIP. TESTING I'M SOMEONE. HAVE DONE THAT BECAUSE IT'S THAT YOU KNOW THEY'VE MADE A CHOICE THAT THAT'S THE WAY IT LOOKS PRETTY THEY DON'T WANT TO KNOW. WE HAVE. BROUGHT COMMUNITY BIG CONCERNS ABOUT OUR SAFETY POLICY BEING WELL COULD GET SOME INFORMATION IT'S IN PERFECT BUT LET'S JUST NOT GET IT ALL. YOU KNOW THAT'S A CONSERVING IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE THE OPTION GET IT. THE NEXT AS WELL WHAT IF YOU DO THE TEST AND SOMEONE COMES UP POSITIVE FOR ME. AND YOU HIRE THEM ANYWAY. WELL OBVIOUSLY FEDERAL ISSUE CONCERNED RIGHT IF YOU CONTRACT FEDERALLY- AND IF YOU DON'T CONTRACT BUT REALLY THERE'S A CONCERN. LIABILITY THEIR LAWSUITS THAT CAN. PROVIDE A NEGLIGENT HIRING IF YOU'RE AWARE. BUT EMPLOYEE POTENTIALLY AND THAT. LATER THERE IS AN ACCIDENT. THAT YOU'RE FACING A LIABILITY OR EVEN IF YOU. EVENTUALLY ARM. WRESTLING ALLEGED IN YOUR. THE FIGHT YOU'RE STILL FACING THE COST OF LEGAL FIGHTS THAT'S OF CONCERN AND THAT LEAVES US WITH THE DEFENSIVE CONCERNED. AND IF THE- COMMITTEE FEELS WE MUST MAINTAIN WHICH IS THE ABILITY TO TEST. AND I CLEAR- AND- TO BE CLEAR THE- HASN'T DISCUSSED EXPLICITLY. VOTERS POSSESS IMPROPER SIXTY FOUR RIGHT EXT DILLY PROTECTED THE ABILITY OF. EMPLOYERS TO KEEP MARIJUANA THE WORKPLACE. ON THE ROCKY RAGING WIRE CAGE WHICH WAS TOUCHED ON I'M JUST BRIEFLY EARLIER. IS. I'M DEALING WITH A FEW ACCOMMODATION UNDER MEDICAL. RIGHT FOUNDED THE VOTERS THIS IS UNDER PRIOR PROP TWO FIFTEEN BUT THE LANGUAGE IS SIMILAR IN PROP SIXTY. THE VOTERS. NOT RIGHT INTO THE. MARIJUANA MUST BE PAID IN THE WORKPLACE PEOPLE CAN USE THIS LESSON CAN STEP THAT HASN'T TAKEN BY THE VOTERS AGAIN I WOULD ECHO I THINK. MITCHELL WHICH CAN LEGISLATING VIA INITIATIVE IS NOT IDEAL. THAT'S WHERE WE ARE PRESENTLY- IN THIS AREA. AND IF I GET. SOME THE OTHER WISE POINTS THAT WERE RAISED I'M DEALING WITH TESTING IN THE ISSUE PERFORMANCE TO REYES. IT AHEAD OF QUESTIONS BUT THAT SERVICE ONE HOURS. SEVEN I. ENGLISH AND TESTING SOME PERFORMANCE IS ALSO AN IMPERFECT ISSUE HAVE FOR POLICE ACTING RIGHT ISSUES LIKE THAT I TWITCH WHEN YOU LOOK A CERTAIN WAY. THE 5265% ACCURATE. IN NOT A PERFECT BAROMETER SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SETTING. LOOK AT. THERE'S JUST NOT THE PERFECT TEST OUT THERE. YOU KNOW I LOOK FORWARD TO IT GLAZER TEST I THINK IT'S A COMPANY CALLED HOUND LAP RECALL CORRECTLY. THAT WOULD BE ON TWENTY TWENTY. SO I HOPE THAT THOSE DEVELOP BETTER THAT WOULD REALLY RESOLVE A LOT OF CONCERN THIS ISSUE AND MAKE IT EASIER EMPLOYERS WHO WOULDN'T THAT IF THAT THAT. WHEN WITH THE U. OF T. C. OR WOULD YOUR LEVEL OF. HE IS AN ANAGRAM HOWEVER IT'S RED. I MEAN IF YOU DID A URINE TEST AND YOU HAVE. THE A METABOLITE. THINK METABOLIZED IN THERE THAT HOW WOULD THAT AFFECT THAT. OPPORTUNITY OR RIGHT. I'M NOT A PERFECT I WILL BE A SCIENTIST AND BREATH YEP BUT VIRTUE THE BREATHALYZER TEST. THEORETICALLY TESS RECENTLY ENOUGH TO DETERMINE EXACTLY WHEN IT WAS CONSUMES THE TERM IF YOU'RE WITHIN THE LIKE END OF IMPAIRMENT WHICH IS THE PROBLEM TESTING YOU CAN'T DETERMINE IT AND THAT WINDOW. I'M SO THAT THAT'S THE IDEAL DIFFERENTIATION MAKE IT POTENTIAL TO NAIL DOWN IT IS THIS TEST INDICATED. PRESENT APPARENTLY. THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY. DENIAL FOR THE. OPTION FOR THE ANSWERS SORRY I'M SO NO NOTE THAT OPTION WOULD BE ATTAINABLE AND FLOSSING HYPOTHETICAL. WHICH IS THE SITUATION THE PROBLEM AND THAT WOULD EMPLOYER WOULD MAKE THAT DECISION WHETHER USE OF HONOR THC AT SOME POINT IN THE LAST THIRTY DAYS- THE PROBLEM OR NOT A PROBLEM WHAT BUT THAT DECISION EMPLOYERS FACED WITH NOW IN THE AND I CAN'T DETERMINE WHEN RIGHT- THAT TEST WE HAVE BETTER DATA. AND I CAN'T BE TOO YOU KNOW WHAT SPECIFIC PLAYERS MIGHT CHOOSE TO DO WITH THAT BETTER SCIENCE BUT I'M HOPEFUL THAT WOULD RESULT IN A CONCERT IT WOULD IS ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY THEN HOW WOULD THAT AFFECT THAT WE HAVE ALLIES FOR THE- WITH AREN'T. RIGHT IF YOU'RE FAT. I MEAN YOU STILL CONSTRUCTING. WELL WHENEVER IT FITS IN RIGHT OR SOMEWHERE IN WHATEVER IT IS AS TO HOW EMPLOYERS EGYPT JEWEL'S POP AND PLAYERS SEE THEY MIGHT. I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE CHOICES THAT YOU. THINK THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW ANYWHERE. YEAH IMPROVEMENT IN THE BENEFIT THERE IS THE- BODY WITH ACCESS TO BETTER DATA RIGHT TO ADDRESS THIS QUESTION OF IMPAIRMENT MORE PRECISE WAY AND TO. I CAN GET TO A SECOND. WORKERS COMPENSATION ONE OF THE ISSUES THERE IS AN EXAMPLE I AGREE. WITH THE ISSUES THAT COME. WORKERS COMPENSATION- AND THERE'S- YOUR WE HAVEN'T DEALT WITH ONE OF ONE OF THEM IS. INTOXICATE SENSES RIGHT AFTER POST ACCIDENT TESTING AND THINGS LIKE THAT. AND BECAUSE TO HAVE A DEFENSE TO WORKERS COMPENSATION BASED ON TALKS ISSHIN RIGHT IF YOU HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE IMPAIRMENT AND ONE OF THE PROBLEMS ON OUR SIDE RIGHT AS EMPLOYERS IS THAT YOU AND- NAIL DOWN IMPAIR. THE PRESENT TESTED SO LET'S SAY THAT YOU HAVE AN EMPLOYER. THIS DUMP I HAVE TO TURN IF THAT WAS A FACTOR. MORE TROUBLING BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD TIME. THAT'S GENERAL POINT THERE- WE SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE OUT THERE WHEN IT. AN I. S. DISTINCTION IT WASN'T DISCUSSED IS FULLY LIKE THERE WERE REFERENCES TO ALCOHOL ONE BETTER TESTING. AT A SAID EARLIER. BUT THE BREATHALYZER YOU CAN TIGHTEN PARENT. RIGHT HOPEFULLY WE GET. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I WANT TO WORK SO MANY GOOD POINTS MADE EARLIER- FORGIVE ME I. MAY HAVE MISSED SOME IS GOING THROUGH. NO WAY OUT COULD CLEARLY GIVE- NICOLE THE BRIEF POINT IS THE EMPLOYERS. WE HAVE THOSE TWO CIVIL CALLS RIGHT ENSURING SAFETY IN THE WORKPLACE AVOIDING ACCIDENTS CAN FOR. TING REGIMES THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL AND AMBIGUOUS. TESTING AN INCOMPLETE KNOWLEDGE IT'S NOT A- SITUATION I WE WISH IT WERE BETTER AND WE'RE HOPEFUL IT WILL IMPROVE BUT- IT STANDS WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO. THE CITY CONCERT. IN IN WHAT YOU DO WE- KNOWING YOU KNOW CERTAIN. CURRENT DRUG TESTING POLICY THE TROOPERS HAVE. IN THE KNOWLEDGE YOU HAVE AND THAT WE HAVE TODAY DID YOU PUT IT BUYS THEM TO CHANGE THAT BOTHERS POLICIES TO SOME OR RECOMMEND. ROACH THAN WHAT WE CURRENTLY ARE USING OR THEY'RE ALL OF. THE WAY IT DOESN'T MATTER SURE- WHY CAN'T. I'M HAS INTIMATE BROAD RECOMMENDATIONS OF. MEMBERSHIP AT. REFER BACK TO THE FIRST PANELS COMMENTS ON- THERE'S ON. THE BENEFITS AND THE NEGATIVE THREAD I THINK. BRANDT WAS OF HER CALL CORRECTLY MADE THAT POINT QUITE APT OUR MEDICAL BENEFITS AND THEY'RE ALSO NEGATIVES ON PERFORMANCE AND I'M IN TILL. PRESIDENT CANNOT GIVE WISH YOU COULD BUT IT WIN THE MATCH NATIONAL SAY THEIR BENEFITS AND- I THINK I WOULD BE REMISS IF I STEPPED BEYOND THEM. COMMENDATIONS. NO THAT'S WONDERFUL THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. HOW ARE YOU. THANK YOU. AND HE RETURNED. ONCE AGAIN MY NAME IS NICOLE RICE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGIES ASSOCIATION I'M WE ARE THE TRADE ASSOCIATION THAT REPRESENTS CALIFORNIA'S MORE THAN THIRTY THOUSAND BACK IN COMPANIES THAT EMPLOY ONE POINT THREE MILLION CALIFORNIA. POSSIBLE FOR TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN GROUPS STATE PRODUCTS SO THAT'S ELEVEN PERCENT. ITS WHOLE ECONOMIC OUTPUT THAT COMES FROM OUR END. WE APPRECIATE THIS CONVERSATION I KNOW THERE'VE BEEN ON DISCUSSIONS A LEGISLATURE AND THE PASSED THROUGH LEGISLATION SO MANUFACTURING COMMUNITY OF. THAT WERE STARTING THE DISCUSSION THAT MIGHT HAPPEN THE FUTURE WITH THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. UP AND IT'S POINT AND WHERE I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE AT ARE COMMENTED. HI THIS POLICY DISCUSSION- TO BE I THINK WE'D LIKE TO SAY IS OPENING STATEMENTS. THIS ISSUE AS WE INCREASE MAKERS AT TAKE A MEASURE APPROACH TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICIES ARE NEEDED TO USE THE LEGALIZATION OF CANNABIS USE WHETHER BE PAUL OR RECREATIONAL ON THIS HEARING A PORTENT TO US BECAUSE THERE IS INFORMATION OUT THERE OF WE. DATA AND I TO BIG DATA AND MEDICAL DATA ALREADY. INFORM ALL ASPECTS OF ALL THE PLAYERS TO ENSURE. AS MENTIONED COMMENTS THE REAL HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS MATT STANDING THEY MIGHT FIND THEMSELVES. EIGHT WHETHER IT'S YOU KNOW RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY FAMILY TIME EMPLOYMENT. A LOT WE WERE. HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL CALIFORNIANS IS IN THIS AREA SO ONE OF THE THINGS. WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THE UNIQUE OF MANUFACTURING. WE ARE A SAFETY SENSITIVE INDUSTRY AS. INDUSTRIAL SPACE YOU HAVE ON IT HE QUIT MEN'S YOU HAVE. HAZARDOUS MATERIAL BE HANDLED MOBILE THE EQUIPMENT. MAN SO SAFETY IS. IT'S A KEY VALUE TO YOU CALIFORNIA'S A MANUFACTURING MEMBER. P. A.'S MAP. PLEASE IN THOSE ENVIRONMENTS AND TO HAVE FULL CONTROL AND BE ALONE AND HOW FULL ALERTNESS TO AVOID REALLY LIFE ALTERING AND LIFE THREATENING INJURIES IF SOMEONE- IF THEIR MEMORIES IMPAIR IT FOR THEIR SAFETY TRAINING AND IT. A. L. YOU KNOW I HAVE FULL OF THEIR THEIR MENTAL CAPACITY THE CASE MAY BE AND THEY'RE WORKING WITH. AND WE SAFETY YOU MUST REAL QUICK MED AND PRODUCT WE CAN HAVE QUESTIONS WERE PEOPLE ARE GETTING INJURED SO EARLY SO THEY'RE LOSING LANDS THEY'RE LOSING. OFFICE THERE'S PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM THE YOU KNOW THE COMPANIES PER ACTIVE SO THAT'S PRODUCT THAT WE HAVE TO START THE PROCESS ALL OVER AGAIN. AND THEY'RE LOSING THEIR LOT. IT'S NOT JUST YOUR LIFE BUT IT'S THE LIFE OF THEIR WORKERS AS WELL THE MANUFACTURING COMMUNITIES IN THE FACILITY. MUCH OF COMMUNITY THE TEAM BASED IN TEAM BUILDING SO EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE. VERY SHARP VERY ALERT. ACTION OF THE ENTIRE TEAM AND THEREFORE THE ENTIRE FACILITY. SO MANY MANUFACTURERS OF NOT ALL. ACTORS OF THE ZERO TOLERANCE DRUG USE POLICIES FOR THAT I RESPECT AND TO THE EARLIER QUESTION FROM USER CHAIR. I'LL CHAIRMAN HEALTH- AS TO YOU KNOW TYPE OF TESTING YOU MIGHT. AND YOU KNOW IS IT HAPPENING AT PRE APPOINTMENT ARE INODE RANDOM SCENE AFTER YOUR EMPLOYER IT ALL OVER THE US THE SPACE FOR MY MEMBERS. IT HAPPENED IN THE PRE EMPLOYMENT SCREENING CAN HAPPEN WHILE YOU'RE ALREADY LATE IT CAN BE. BEING A COULD BE SCHEDULED TESTING IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUR ROLE RESPONSIBILITY IS IN THAT PROP. AND THE POLICIES OF THAT COMPANY SO I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT COULD WIPE. THEM WHY THAT'S IMPORTANT. PUBLISHED ONE AS A ROBERT MENTIONED IT'S FEDERAL YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE FEDERAL PROHIBITION RELATED TO THIS SCHEDULE ONE NARCOTIC AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND MY COMPANIES BECAUSE WERE MANUFACTURERS BECAUSE OF MANUFACTURES AND BECAUSE OF WHAT WE DO. WERE EITHER DIRECTLY CONTRACTING WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR WE HAVE CUSTOMERS WHO ARE EITHER DIRECTLY CONTRACTING OR ARE IN STATES THAT DON'T HAVE. THESE LEGAL USES FOR CANNABIS AND SO THEY HAVE IN THEIR CAR TRACKS THAT YOU CANNOT ALLOW FOR BASING YOUR FACILITY SO WHEN WE ENTER INTO THAT CONTRACT WERE BITING. THOSE REQUIREMENTS OF OUR CUSTOM SOME OF THE CONTRACTS HAVE IN PLACE FOR YEARS FOR DECADES AND SO THERE'S A GREAT. MANUFACTURING TO BE AS RELATES TO THOSE THOSE CUSTOMER CONTRACTS. IF YOU HAVE TO GO BACK INTO GHOST THOSE CONTRACTS PUTTHOSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS BACK ON THE TABLE THEY MIGHT. SEEN AS A VIABLE IT YOU KNOW CONTRACTING PARTNER BECAUSE OF ONE PARTICULAR CONCERN SO ALL OF. ON PROBATION RELATED TO CANNABIS CLOUDS ALONG. I'M SECONDLY IT'S THE LIABILITY SO AS I TALKED ABOUT INJURIES THAT CAN HAPPEN. WE HAVE A LOT OF WORKER PROTECTIONS THAT ARE IN THE WORKPLACE. AND OVER LEAVE THAT THERE'S AN INJURY IN THE WORKPLACE IT IT THE EMPLOYER DO THEIR DUE DILIGENCE TO PREVENT OR PROTECT FOR THAT INJURY HAPPENING SO TESTING IS A- BIG PART OF THAT FOR ME AND- IN THE SAFETY SENSITIVE INDUSTRIAL SPACES SO WE'RE MAKING. FOR THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE WORKING IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT ELEMENTS OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS OR- YOU THE. OF THE JOB. TO DO THE ASCENT FUNCTIONS OF THAT SHOP. YOU SEE ANY TYPE OF IMPAIRMENT IN THEIR ABILITY TO FUNCTION IN THOSE A CENTRAL RESPONSIBILITIES. WHETHER IT WHATEVER IS CAN IS A OR CAUSING THAT IMPAIRMENT THEN WE HAVE A COUPLE OF WAYS OF DEALING WITH THAT ANOTHER QUESTION YOU WERE AT SHERMAN HILL SOMETIMES IT'S DETERMINE. IS CORRECT SO MY COMPANY TAP METAL POLE PASILA TEASE AT. ON SITE SO MAYBE THERE'S GOING TO IT. PATIENTS SO THAT PERSON IS REMOVED FROM THE JOB. UNTIL THEY CAN FIGURE OUT IF THEY YOU KNOW FAT TO BE ABLE TO DO THOSE ESSENTIAL FUNCTION SOMETIMES IT'S YOU KNOW SOMETIMES REMOVAL MIGHT BE PUTTING THEM DIFFERENT PLACE BUT SOMETIMES MIGHT ALSO BE SENDING THEM HOME INTO THAT EVALUATION CAN HOUSE. THERE'S ALSO IN IN VARIOUS BY YOU ASIANS THAT MIGHT OCCUR THERE'S G. SAYS EMBEDDED IN THAT SO IF THE EMPLOYER DISAGREES WITH YOU KNOW WHAT THE. FIGHT ENGINE IS THERE'S A PROCESS IN PLACE FOR THEM TO A. SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS. THAT CAN BE DONE. AND THEN ALL OF. IS WITH THE MANUFACTURER'S KEEPING IN MIND THAT THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO DISMISS. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH EVIDENCE BUT THEY HAVE TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO ME. THAT FACILITY FOR THE CUP AND THAT INDIVIDUAL IN BEING COMPLIANT LAWS OF CAL OSHA THEIR SAFETY LAWS AND SUCH- THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO HAVE ON. THE RELIABLE CASTING SO MY MEMBERS PHIL RESOUND THAT UNTIL WE CAN BE ABLE TO BET. HERMAN THE IMPAIRED MISS. USING CANNON EITHER MET FOR MEDICAL REASONS OR FOR RECREATIONAL REASON AND COMING INTO THE WORKPLACE AND THEIR ABILITY TO DO THE CENTRAL FUNCTIONS OF THAT JOB IF THE SENSITIVE ENVIRONMENT. THEN WE CANNOT LACKS ORTEZ. IT NEEDS TO BE THERE THAT FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE THERE IT. DISCUSSIONS THAT CAN BE. YES ARENA I THINK AND WE'RE BALANCING LIABILITY LIKE I SAID. SOME OF THE EVER CAN THANK YOU SO MUCH J. FOR SHARING THAT WHAT SOME OTHER STATES ARE DOING. MY AGE OUR FOLKS ARE SAYING YOU CAN ALWAYS LOOK AT WHAT OTHER STATES. AND A AS CALIFORNIA LET'S GO AHEAD ADOPT OUT WHOLE HEARTEDLY BECAUSE WE HAVE A LAW OR PROGRESS. A LADY AND SO YOU LAW AND STICK INTO THAT SITUATION MAKES IT VERY. VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO COMPLY SO WE HAVE TO. NINETEEN SB. OFTEN FACILITIES AND OTHER DIFFERENT STATES. CORPORATE ALL OF THE VARIOUS. SECTIONS BUT JUST AT THE OPPORTUNITY WE ALSO SEE THE BERRY. BALANCING ACT SO WE'RE HAPPY TO BE PART OF THIS CALL ASIAN. ONE EIGHT LEGISLATURE AS I SAID IN MY OLD COMMENT TAKE A MEASURED APPROACH. SUGGESTION COULD BE AS OTHER LAWS. EXEMPTS SAFETY SENSITIVE INDUSTRIES BECAUSE I THINK EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOLS. CAME TO WORK AND- SO WE'RE HAPPY TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION WE APPRECIATE WHAT IS TAKING PLACE TODAY AND I AM. QUESTIONS THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER THANK YOU. I THINK. THE FACT THAT THE CANNABIS. IMPAIRMENT. I THINK GOING VERY DECISIVE AND. IN THE SYSTEM IN THE INDUSTRY IN IN EVERY LEVEL OF. EXACTLY WHERE YOU THE TESTING OF THE NOT TESTING AND HOW IT WORKS. HOW OFTEN. I THINK THIS IS THE SCRIPT SENATE MITCHELL THANK YOU- I APPRECIATE YOUR DESIRE THAT THE LEGISLATURE TAKE A VOTE I THINK THE VOTERS TO AN OPTION WE FROM AFTER THE PROPERTY FOR I THINK I'D CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT GO THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AT. VERTICALLY BUDGET IT WOULD. BE FOR IT. ASK US WHAT WOULD BE A GREAT TATIAN DATE FOR YOU. THEY DIDN'T THEY- EIGHT THAT WE THAT HAVE WHY WITH SO. WHICH IS WHY I DON'T. MALES FACTORS THE STEPS ARE TAKEN IN. I HAVE A GOOD. A COUPLE OF YEARS DURING THE INTERIM AND BREAKS- TO READ IN MEETING WITH MANUFACTURERS IN MY DISTRICT I HAVE SURPRISE AT. THE HEARING NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS. YOU KNOW A VERY URBAN DISTRICT BUT I HAVE QUITE A FEW I REPRESENT A GOOD PORTION. BRING AREAS AND FIRST A LOT. AND SO. ON THAT IN HERE AND YOU. AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE IN A ROUND. THE BILL THE I WANT TO DO ONE'S JOB SAFELY. I THINK. CANADA I WILL KLAY BECAUSE OF AFFECTED. COLLEGE YEAH THINK ABOUT SLEEP DEPRIVATION WHEN I THINK ABOUT. THE SICK DISTRACTION THE TIMES ON CELL PHONES AND TEXTING ALL IN ALL WORKPLACE. AND THOSE ARE THINGS WERE TEST. WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW IF IN. PERCEPTION OF IT AND IF WE'RE NOT REALLY LOOKING AT IT. TERMS UP ARE THE TRUE CAUSES OF DANGEROUS INCIDENTS CRITICALLY MANUFACTURING SPACES. THANK YOU EVERYONE'S GOT ONE THE AND HAS A NEED TO LOOK AT DISTRACTED BY- AS OPPOSED TO PROP- OUGHT NUMBER FROM FULL WHO ARE ENGAGED IN IT IS NOW. A LEGAL SUBSTANCE IN OUR STATE. NO I APPRECIATE THAT AND SENATOR MITCHELL AND. HERE THAT YOU'RE GETTING OUT IN AND LOOK AT THE INDUSTRY- SO THEY ARE HE TRAINING AND PERCY AND SUCH. MINIMIZE DISTRACTIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WE ARE EMPLOYEES YOU WON'T SEE OUR EMPLOYEES IF YOU TAKE IT AS YOU TAKE. YOU KNOW THERE ARE SPECIFIC PLACES WHERE YOU'RE WALKING WHEN YOU'RE WALKING YOU'RE NOT ON YOUR PHONE I MEAN I RECENTLY JUST VISIT ONE OF OUR LARGER ME ACTORS ON IT SAN DIEGO AREA AND THEY SENT US A BIT. BEFORE I TO NOT OKAY BUT THEN GO ON LINE AND ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS SO THAT THEY KNEW THAT WE SAW BEFORE EVEN GET THROUGH THE DOOR TO DO THE TO AND WHERE THE REPRESENTED OF THE INDUSTRY SO OUR SAFETY PROCEDURES ARE VERY- VERY STRICT. AND WE TAKE THEM. INSTEAD COMPREHENSIVE THAT'S CORRECT OKAY TO THE ISSUE OF CANADA I THINK WE- LAWYER ANY MORE STRONGLY. NOT A NOT PERMISSION NODE RIGHT ABOUT THIS. IT'S NOT JUST A LEVEL OF IMPAIRMENT DON'T EVEN HAVE A STAFF PRESERVATION FOR IMPAIRMENT TO CANNABIS USE. ROBERT AND I COULD TAKE THE SAME AMOUNT. DOES HAVE THE HE DOES. YEAH ABOUT THAT I AM TYPE ONE DIABETIC WELL THAT IS. AFTER THAT GOING TO IT. MY USE OF CANNABIS COULD BE COULD BE EXTREMELY NEGATIVE SO EVERY INDIVIDUAL HAS A NEW ONES THAT WE IS THE EMPLOYER SOME OF THE STATE HE EVEN ASKED. CAN'T DIG INTO THE. MEDICAL HISTORY BY ASKING C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;. FIGURE THAT OUT&lt;/c&gt;</u> PROHIBITED AGAIN BY SO THERE ARE A LOT OF LAWS THAT ARE INTERSECTING INVITING US YES HE JUST MAKING THINGS IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE LAWYER TO BE ABLE TO GREAT THIS IN A WAY THAT WE CAN HAVE ENOUGH NOT. WE'RE SENDING SOMEONE INTO A SICK PLACE AND THAT IS THERE. THAT THEY WILL BE SAFE AND THEY WILL AIR TO SAFETY PROCEDURES THAT WILL ENSURE THAT. THERE WAS EARLIER JUST A PRESCRIPTION DRUG YEAH I'M THERE MIGHT BE THIS PERCEPTION THAT EMPLOYERS IF SOMEBODY IS USING PRESCRIPTION DRUG THEN THEY'RE SAYING MS. WE'RE USING THE THIS PRESCRIPTION DRUG AND WE HEY THAT'S FINE AND- OTHER DISCUSSION NOT THE CASE I CAN. LAST YEAR WERE. INTO A BILL THAT TRYING TO EQUATE THE USE OF. TO THE TREATMENT OF FIRST FOR PRESCRIPTION. QUESTION RIGHT WHAT'S HAPPENING IT'S- IT. THIRD PARTY IF YOU WILL. ASH WHAT THE SIDE EFFECTS ARE. HEY AS A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION. MEDICATION YOU NEED TO TAKE IT TO WHAT. FROM THE FDA THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS THAT THIS DRUG START DISSIPATE IN THE SYSTEM AND THEREFORE DOZEN IN ACT REACT. YOU KNOW AUDIT BUT OUR THAT'S INFORMATION WE JUST A- FOR CANADA AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT YOU TO TAKE. ORDER FOR US AGAIN AS MAN YOU FACT. SAFE SINCE THE END.

IN THINKING ABOUT THE NUMBERS THAT THE FIRST PANEL SHARED WITH THAT YOU'RE- DELETED. IN TERMS OF I DIDN'T FIND SOLUTIONS. YES THAT'S WHY CAN BRING WITH. TO BE LEADERS WE ALWAYS LIKE TO DO WE CAN ON IT I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUE IS THAT THE FIRST PANEL. IN THIS AREA THERE. SO MANY DIFFERENT. STEPS RIGHT HELLO I'VE PRIOR TO THIS MUNICIPAL LAW. STEP SIX FEDERALLY TO BRING THIS TO A PLACE THAT WOULD CHANGE THE CHANGE THAT SURROUNDING PIECE FOR BUSINESS. THAT'S I THINK HOPEFULLY THINGS WILL CHANGE AS TO POLICY. YOU'LL COMPANIES DIFFERENT POLICIES THAT SOME HAVE CHOSEN TO STOP. BECAUSE THEY FOUND THAT THAT WAS SO IF SOME EMPLOYEES RIGHT. I CAN'T YOU KNOW I PREFER NOT TO SPEAK THE INDIVIDUAL POLICIES WERE VERY BROAD GROUP YEAH BUT SOMEHOW IN THAT. NOT I'M HOPEFUL THAT AS IN THAT WE TALKED. ABOUT STATES THE LABORATORIES OF DEMOCRACY MAYES AT HER EARLIER. ALL COMPANIES THAT WILL TAKE THOSE. HOPEFULLY WILL HELP THE INDUSTRY IN A WAY THAT WILL BE BACK. BUT STILL MANY ANGLES HERE THAT I I'M HESITANT TO COMMIT MORE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. I CENTER THANK GOD FOR THE TESTIMONY COMMENTS WAS VERY INFORMATIVE. OUR FINAL PANEL TODAY IS- PAPER STAKEHOLDERS OPPORTUNITIES FOR HIGH SKILL HIGH WAGE JOBS JEFF FERRO JUSTIN AT THE NET IN COMMERCIAL WORKERS. AND BUCK DIRECTOR OF THE TEAMSTERS CANNABIS DIVISION. COME WICKS WORK. FOR WHAT HOW ARE YOU WONDERFUL THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR PARTICIPATING TODAY. YOUR FIRST OUR ORDER SURE. YES I'M JEFF FERAL I ACTUALLY BECAME THE DIRECTOR OF THE U. W.'S. I HAVE ALSO PROJECT EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT FOR THE DIRECT ORGANIZING FOR THE UFCW. BUT I HAVE BEEN. TO YES. WELL ABOUT THE UC W'S BEEN ORGANIZING CANNABIS WORKERS BEFORE THAT- IN FACT- ONE OF YOUR SACRAMENTO LOCAL OPERATE. THE FIRST- CONTRACTED THERE'S AN LIKE MID TWO THOUSAND THE EARLY TWO THOUSAND AN HAS BEEN OFFERED YOU KNOW AS A SINGLE SMALL OPERATORS BEEN ABLE TO GROWN IS NOW. WE ALRIGHT. THROUGH CONTRACTS EMPLOYERS AND FOURTEEN IN CANADA. REPRESENT WORKERS FROM SEED TO SAIL IN MANUFACTURING TESTING LABS XIN LABS DELIVERY HERS- WORKERS THAT WORK IN RETAIL SPACE SO THERE'S NOT REALLY AN OCCUPANT. REPRESENT UP AND SO WE'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE CHALLENGE OF THOSE. THE UNIQUE PART ABOUT THAT IS THAT PART OF THE CHALLENGE THE EMPLOYERS TALKED ABOUT OUR CHALLENGES THAT ARE WORKERS I'M FACES WELL THEIR ABILITY TO GET OURS AND QUALITY. AND THE QUALITY AND BENEFITS ARE DIRECTLY TIED TO THE WORKERS THAT ARE WORKING IN THE ILLEGAL MARKET THAT ARE NOT. TO THE SAME STANDARDS ARE NOT GETTING END OF. SEASON ONE. RETIREE BENEFITS MEMBERS GET THE HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS OUR MEMBERS GET THE EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANT SOME OF THEM GET. AS FOR THEIR. AND OF COURSE WHEN IS A BIG THING. THE BANKING A LOT BECAUSE WITHIN THE SPACE HAVE CHALLENGES OF GETTING LOANS BE ABLE TO GET A CAR DEALERSHIP POINT. THE SEVENTH ST. LEADING BOTH HERE AND AT THE FEDERAL MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S BANKING ACCESS AND SO SOME OF THE BANKING STUFF IS WAITIN FOR. OF VOTE SENATE. THE LEVEL OF YOU KNOW WE PROVIDE A LOT OF TESTIMONY AND WORKERS AND EMPLOYERS TO GIVE TESTIMONY. WE WILL BE ABLE TO. KEEP TING PENTA ALLOWING TAX. PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE TWO EIGHTY TURN BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL LAW THAT SAYS THAT. IS CAN'T WRITE OFF THEIR COSTS. TERM OUR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE OF THE EQUIPMENT CAN BUY OF THAT COMES DIRECTLY OUT OF THE BOTTOM LINE OF THE EMPLOYER BUT THAT'S EQUIPMENT THAT YOU'RE JOBS BETTER THEIR JOB SAY. IT IS ALSO THE KIND OF MONEY THAT USED TO PAY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING PROCESSES TO THESE AND IN THAT AND THEY CONTINUE LEAST ONES WE WORK WITH. A JOB WITH BENEFITS AND WORKING CONDITIONS THE U. OF C. W. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. DOESN'T LEVEL WE STARTED OF- A NATIONAL RAM OF NOT JUST THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM AND SINCE. FEDERAL LAWS WE GOT THE AND TO HELP EMPLOYERS AND AGAIN WE GOT THE- YES SIR JURISDICTION ON A CASE IN MAINE. AND THAT PROVIDE A WAY FOR US TO START LOOKING AT HOW DO WE GET HELPFUL FOR PLANS NOW. FOR THAT WE ARE WITH IF THEY CHOOSE TO SPEND EITHER INTO OR OUT OF CALIFORNIA HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE. BOTH THEM AND THEIR EMPLOYERS I MEAN THE MANAGERS. SAME WITH RETIREE BENEFITS AND THEN WE STARTED REALLY TACKLING. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SO. FOURTEEN WIDE FOR PERMISSION BERMAN THOUSAND FIFTEEN. BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE BEGAN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT. NUMBER ONE HAS THE ONLY STATES DEFIED JOURNEY PERSON. THE WORK HERE IN TOWN IN SACRAMENTO THAT WAS GRADUATED AND- CERTIFIED. THE JOURNEY PERSON AT THIS INDUSTRY WE BELIEVE IMPORTANT- JUST FOR THAT WORK BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS INDUSTRY ABOUT PROCESSES THE WITH A MAYBE. AN ABYSS WHICH SOME PEOPLE REALLY NERVOUS ABOUT. PROCESSES WHETHER CULTIVATE. THING ELSE WHETHER THEIR PROCESSING. A LOT OF OUR INDUSTRY. CAN WE REPRESENT ARMOS UTICA MANUFACTURES SENT AGRICULTURAL VOTERS SENT IN BY ISRAELI FACTORS IN PESTICIDE MAKERS FOR THOSE FOLKS AS WELL WE REPRESENT ME CUTTERS REGULATED. FRIENDSHIP FOR THE- OF CARE PROVIDERS AND WE HAVE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FOR THEM OR. SO WE THINK THAT THESE ARE SKILLED BASE FROM. THAT WE CAN DO THAT IF THE STATE CERTIFIES FOLKS IS HAVING A STATE CERTIFIED. THAT. TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT I AM YOU HAVE A STATE CERTIFIED WORKFORCE OF THIS PLACE. OUR STATE AND WE THINK THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT ALLOWS THE IMP USED TO DEMAND BETTER AS- HAVE A MORE SECURE WORKPLACE AND IT ALSO ALLOWS THEM TO. MANY FACTORIES BEEN LEAVING OUR COUNTRY CAMPUS IS DEGENERATING INTERESTED MANUFACTURER CULTIVATE. FOR BUSINESSES LEAVING OUR COUNTRY BUT YOUNG PEOPLE ARE. CANNABIS AND ALL THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT GO ALONG WITH THAT AND THAT ALLOWS THEM TO BE INTEREST THING THAT WE'RE LOSING INTERESTED WE'VE TURNED INTO A SEARCH ON THE STREET IN THIS COUNTRY AND THIS IS REAP ALL THE ASPECTS THAT OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN SOME OF THE- VERY BEST AT. SO THIS PROGRAM ARMY. YOU KNOW GOOD MONEY GREAT IT'S HAVE STABILITY. YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT PEOPLE GETTING TESTED YOU HAVE A CONTRACT THAT HAS. GRIEVANCE OR VISIT OUR PROCEDURE WE WILL WIN WORKERS THE FACT THAT IT HAVE A MEDICAL CARD BETTER ABLE TO PROVE THAT THEY WERE UNDER THE INFLUENCE FALL. ON ONE OF THE OFFICE THE TABLE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK ARE GONNA HELP US AND THE PART THE LEFT IS THE RECENT PASSAGE. I THINK IT'S TWELVE NINETY ONE WHICH. WE GOT THAT EARLY ON HERE IN THE MEDICAL AND WAS EXTENDED ADULT USE AND IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD TO GET SOME CLARITY ON WHAT REALLY IS GOING TO HAPPEN IF WE PRESSED IN. ON IT. AND I THINK THAT'S GONNA HELP WITH- RAISING THE STANDARDS FOR ALL WRITERS HERE. I THINK THERE'S REALLY THREE THINGS ALSO YOU NEED TO LOOK AT WHICH IMPACT ARE PART. OF THEIR ABILITY. CHALLENGES AND YOU HEARD IT FROM BOTH LAWYERS AND SMALL BOX. IT'S THE ENFORCEMENT. IT'S THE TAXATION AND IT'S THE BANDS. THE BAND'S PEOPLE LET'S SEE. I'M SOMEWHAT. BIG OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE IN THE ILLEGAL MARKET. IF THERE IS A ROBUST ENFORCEMENT. END UP HAPPENING IS. MOTHER FOLKS IT'LL DRIVE. WE'LL GET ILL LIKE THE VAPING. THEN TAXATION IN. REALLY HARD FOR THESE PEOPLE TO COMPETE. ALLIES ONES THAT ARE ABLE TO MAKE IT WE TALKED. THIS TO- YOU KNOW THE DISSENT TRIES THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE IMPACTED DRUGS MAKING IT. DIVERSITY IN EQUITY IN THE SENATE. THE CHALLENGES. WITH THE CAP. WITH THE LACK OF OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE ACCESS TO TRAINING. THE EXPERIENCE THAT BY A PRODUCT THAT SAFETY CONSUMERS. PERSON FRANKLY SAFE TO ALL OF YOU THAT. IN THIS MYSTERY BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU FACE OR IF ALL GOES UP. THE TERM. ON THE WHAT PLAGIARISM THE GOVERNORS THERE SIGNED BOB THIS TO HAPPEN. BECAUSE EVEN APPROVED IT THEY'RE STILL GOING TO EXPECT YOU TO PUT. THAT YOU SERVE. THINGS LIKE THAT THAT ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE INDUSTRY TO STABLE AS THIS. WHICH WILL ALLOW US. AS FOR FIRST. BRING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR CLUB. THE RIGHT TO BE A WHISTLEBLOWER IF SOMETHING'S GOING BAD IN A BAD EMPLOYER IT ALLOWS AND THE FIRST LINE. OF ENFORCEMENT ARE MEMBERS OF THE FIRST. SOMETHING'S GOING WRONG THEY COULD TRY TO HANDLE IT INTERNALLY. IT DOESN'T GET RID. WHAT THE CUSTOMER THEY'VE THEY REALLY CARE. ALMOST A CONNECTION OF MAIN ISSUE. WORKERS WERE CONCERNED WITH AN EMPLOYER OR PUTTING. SIDES ALL PRODUCT AT THE END OF THE- BY SPECKLED. THE CONCERNS OF HOW THAT MIGHT. DEFICIENCIES I'M SURE WORKERS GET SICK. IT'S GOT SICK. THE US TO HELP THEM AND THAT'S REALLY HOW. HE DROVE THE KILLER BE PROCESSED WITH THE INDUSTRY SO IF YOU REQUEST. VERY MUCH APPRECIATED SIDE HI THERE THANKS FOR HAVING ME WHEN YOU BECAUSE NOT ALL BLOCKING. STIRS CANNABIS DIVISION I'M I'M GONNA. JUST. ABOUT JOBS IN THE ASIAN AND WHAT CANNABIS AND WITH THAT INDUSTRY CAN ACTUALLY. HELLO ALSO THE NATION. HE AND IT'S PROJECT THAT CANNABIS REGULATED LEGAL CANNABIS WILL CREATE ABOUT. JOBS THROUGHOUT THE NAY WHICH SUBSTANTIAL. AMOUNT OF WORKERS I. ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING INDUSTRIES IS. TREES UP AT EIGHT COME ONLINE AND THAT'S. SO TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF JOBS. ASK THE CATION. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RETAIL WORKERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DELIVERY EVERS TRANSPORT DRIVERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SECURE. FREE BUSINESS SAYS- GROW AND- TRIMMERS PEOPLE THAT WORK IN CULTURAL ASPECTS SO THIS ISN'T JUST. ABOUT WHAT. RETAIL IS ACTUALLY COVERING LIKE JEFF SAID. SALE. IS OF FOLKS BEGIN ANYWHERE BETWEEN A BUDGET CAN MAKE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND THIRTY. MASTER GROWERS IN TRACTORS CAN MAKE UP TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR- THEY RANGE IS REALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SET UP STAND. UP FOR THIS IS DO YOU HAPPEN MENTION THAT YOU HAVE. IS THAT VARY FROM CITY TO COUNTY. PLAYING FIELD THERE- THE TEAMSTERS OF NEGOTIATED CONTRACTS AND RAISED WE- TWENTY SIX DOLLARS AN HOUR FOR DISTRIBUTION DRIVERS WHICH WE FEEL IS A IS A WILL H. SO I'M I WAS ASKED SPECIFICALLY WHAT UNIONS CAN DO FOR THIS INDUSTRY. AND WHY WERE HERE AT TEN QUESTION MEANT WE DO HAVE A ROOF. FRAME IS THE HAS TWENTY OR MORE EMPLOYEES TO ENGAGE WITH THE LETTER UNION HAVE LABOR PEACE. AND SOME OF THE OPERATORS THAT YOU. I HAVE ENGAGE WITH UP OF THE STAB YOU IN THE TEAMSTERS. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND WHAT LABOR IN. AND I KNOW JEFF AS WELL. HE WAS REALLY SET A STANDARD SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE TAKING IT GROUND ILLICIT MARKET. BRINGING IT UP OUT OF THE SHOW. WITH A GROUP OF WORKERS THAT HAVE NOT HAD WORKERS. AND SOME OF OUR GREAT IN FEAR AND I RECEIVE PHONE CALLS AND THIS IS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. EITHER. PAID SO THOSE STERN- ARE STILL WELL IN THERE. WORKERS WITH WORK IF SUCH AS UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS LONG HOURS UNDER PATIENT LOW PAY WAITSTAFF WE SEEK A WORK ENVIRONMENT THAT. DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT IN REGARDS. CAMPUS AND WE SEE PROTECTION FOR WORKERS SUCH AS PER YOUR USING PESTICIDES. WE'LL SAFE SAFELY ENSURING THAT OUR. OPERATE IN SAFE CONDITIONS IN HOURS. DRIVERS WHO ARE OUT OF PUBLIC TO ACTUALLY WEAR PROTECTIVE BULLETPROOF VESTS AND THESE WORKERS ARE NOT PART AB SIDE OF A DISPENSARY WITH A GUARD AT THE DOOR. TRANSPLANT THAT. AND CASH ON CALIFORNIA RIGHT. THIS WAS A RIGHT HAD TO ACTUALLY FOR FOUR AND ONE BECAUSE THE COMPANY ASKED OUR DRIVERS TO NOT WITH THEM. YOU KNOW. THE CONDUIT BETWEEN WORKERS AND MANAGEMENT. CATION. PENSION AND HEALTH IS WEALTH IS THAT OUR OB AT DISCOUNT RATE ALSO BETTER PAY. MANY YEARS AGO THE TEAMSTERS WERE FILED IN HELPING SHAPE NO CLASS INTO THIS FIGHT TODAY NOW MORE. THAN EVER IN OUR NATION. THE BILL IS THE WAIVER. SINCE THE GAP BETWEEN THE OLD. FILL THAT ONE SHOT. YOU SHOULD GET A LIVING WAGE. WILL IT COME FAMILIES AND THAT INSTEAD YOUR SECOND JOB. ENORMOUS JOB GROWTH THE KING HAS PROVIDED ORGANIZATION IS TO ENSURE THAT. ENDS WITH IF IT'S A IS THAT CAN SUSTAIN A ROBUST MIDDLE CLASS. THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. THANK YOU. THE ISSUE. THAT THAT THAT SEEM TO BE CONSUMERS. TWO TWO AND DEFINE THE STANDARD HOW IT WOULD DO. WITH THAT. BUT WE. THE HARD SPACE TO BE BECAUSE OF THEIR. TAKE PLACE AND- THE I DON'T EAT THEM BUT SOMETIMES WE CAN CROSS REEFER MADNESS. IF THERE ARE. MAINTAIN AND TRYING TO WE WENT TO BUY PRODUCT IN YOUR ABILITY TO PEOPLE. SOME HAVE CHANGED. HI ELLEN PHONE FROM NORTH. THEY FAR AHEAD OF US. JUST CANNABIS MARKET. BUT WHERE WE DO HAVE THE TEAMSTERS. LIKE DENVER WHERE THESE ARE THINGS WHERE WE. YOU PROTECTIONS FOR WORK. GOVERNMENT CARD HERE USING THE THING YOU CAN DO TO HELP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND THAT. IT'S A GOOD INFORMATION. NOW OPEN TO PUBLIC COMMENT IS ANYONE. COME TO SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL. THIS ASSOCIATION SPENCER IS OUT OF OUR SO IN CALIFORNIA AND CLEAN UP THE LIST. OUR MEMBERS ARE ORGAN. AND. THE SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAM THIS SUPPORT THAT IT. WITH THE CITY. REGULATE AND IS THERE. TWO HOW ARE WE TO RESPECT THOSE LOCAL READY HAVE A DOT. AND DO THEIR WORK THE DAVE DOT I WAS PUSHING THEM BACK AND CREATE I THIS ORDER ARE WE. BOB WHAT THAT IS FOR OUR OUR LICENSE. THE TALKING ABOUT LORDS ONLINE CHAT ROOMS AND THERE ARE THANK YOU LATER BY THE BY THE DIFFERENT AGENCIES. I WAS THE FIRST TIME THE STATE WERE GIVEN THAT AUTHORITY. TEAM TO PUT MORE COPS. I. THAT OFFICE THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE ENOUGH I WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH AND DIRECT TO. I EAGLE OPERATORS I. AT WHAT POINT B. GET RID OF THAT MARKET THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HAVE A- AT LOGISTICS- THINK MOST. HE SAID I WOULD LIKE TO JUST A. ONCE I THINK ARE IMPORTANT ACTUALLY ONE THAT'S A NEW. THE. ALL THE GOOD REASONS WHY WE ARE IN THE AND WE ARE AND WE'RE SEEING THE PROSPECT OF TONY LET US IN THE INDUSTRY. REALLY THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING AS AS A LEGISLATURE IS PUT MORE. UNFORCED ATTEMPT TO THE LAST TWO BUDGET CYCLE I'M SORRY THAT THE CENTER OF THE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE HAD TO LEAVE EARLY- WE'VE TRIED. STRENUOUSLY TO PUT MORE MONEY IN AND HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL THE MONEY THAT'S NECESSARY. ANYBODY WHO QUESTIONS THAT THE ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES ARE NOT NEARLY. ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE I'M I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT SLIGHTLY DISAGREEING. WITH A COMMENT MADE EARLIER- INCENTIVES TO CITIES TO HAVE A TO ADOPT ORDINANCES TO SALAS RETAIL COULD COULD BE USED AS A AS A LEVERAGE TO GET THEM. THE MONEY FOR FORCING COULD BE USED AS A LEVERAGE TO GET THEM TO- TO ADOPT LOCAL ORDINANCES I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY NOT HAVE A LOCAL ORDINANCE. IN THOSE CITIES THAT DON'T HAVE A LOCAL ORDINANCE ARE A LOT OF THE ILLEGAL OPERATOR. AND SO WE DO NEED ENFORCEMENT HAPPENING IN THOSE LOCATIONS AS WELL- BECAUSE THEY ARE COMPETITION FOR THOSE WHO ARE LEGALLY OPERATE. THE LAST POINT I WOULD MAKE SOMETHING HAS NOT BEEN RAISED UP UNTIL TWO YEARS AGO THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY WAS ALSO INVOLVED IN HELP- AND CBT THAT WAS DERIVED FROM HIM- WITH FORTY PART OF OUR OF OUR MARKETING. AND THAT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM US IN THE REGULATIONS- IN LARGE PART BECAUSE POPS BEFORE DIDN'T EXCLUDED HIM FROM FROM FROM CANNABIS- WE ARE NOW BOYS- IN YOUR HOUSE WITH LEGISLATION TO RESTORE ON THAT AUTHORITY NOT JUST TO CANNABIS BUT TO THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE- WE THINK THAT WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARDS HELPING TO- COUNTER SOME OF THE LOSS IN JOBS THAT WE'RE SEEING BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM WITH. WITH THE CAMERAS INDUSTRY WITH HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL ADOPT THE HIM CHANGES AND ENTHUSIASTICALLY AND. VERY QUICKLY COME THE FIRST OF THE YEAR. THANK YOU WHICH WHARTON. GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON RICH MILLER. HAVEN'T SEEN ANY PATIENT SPEAK TODAY SO I'M AS SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE PATIENTS I HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THIS. I'VE BEEN UNDER MEDICAL CARE FOR FORTY FIVE YEARS UP UNTIL ABOUT EIGHT YEARS AGO AND I SWEAR OFF ALL LESTER MEDICINE BECAUSE THE WESTERN MEDICINE I WAS GIVEN WAS ACTUALLY KILLING ME- I HAD A SERIOUS ACCIDENT AND TWO THOUSAND SIX I A FIVE. THE CONDITIONS THAT QUALIFY MUSETTE MEDICAL CANNABIS PATIENTS. PERPIGNAN THE ROBERT C. IS NUMBER ONE AND TWO THOUSAND SIX I HAD A VERY. ACCIDENT WERE I WANT OF USING A WALKER AND A CANE. AT THAT TIME THEY STARTED LEARN ME UP WITH PHARMACEUTICALS AT THE END OF MY PHARMACEUTICAL USED IN TWO THOUSAND LEFT OUT ELEVEN I WAS ON FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MEDICATIONS A MONTH. I'VE GONE DOWN TO FORTY WHO- I HAD DROPPED FORTY FIVE POUNDS DOWN TO A HUNDRED AND TEN POUNDS. THOSE USING CANES AND WALKERS TO GET AROUND. ANNOUNCED TO ME THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO FOR ME THEY WERE TELLING ME I WAS INTRACTABLE THE PHARMACEUTICAL FOR A LONGER WORKING. A TURN TO CANNABIS AND I'D USE FAN OF THIS BEFORE AND I HELPED OTHER MEDICAL PATIENTS USED CANNABIS. WE DIDN'T CONSIDER MYSELF A PATIENT. WAS AT THAT TIME I REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT CANNABIS WAS TO ME IN MY LIFE. I CAN SAY NOW. I'VE BEEN EIGHT YEARS PHARMACEUTICAL FREE I DON'T EVEN USES SO MUCH AS AN ASPIRIN EVERYTHING IS TREATED HOLISTICALLY WITH CANNABIS. AND I DO USE T. H. C. A. WHICH IS NON PSYCHOACTIVE. HAS NOT BEEN ACTIVATED SO IF YOU WERE TO TEST ME. I WOULD TEST X. LEE HIGH AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT NOW I AM NOT MEDICATED AT ALL. I HAVE ALL MY COGNITIVE ABILITIES YES IF YOU WERE TO USE THIS TEST MY TOLERANCE LEVELS WOULD BE THROUGH THE ROOF. BECAUSE I TAKE TWO THOUSAND MILLIGRAMS OF THC A. DAY ALONG WITH TWO THOUSAND MILLIGRAMS CBV. SO GOING FORWARD HOW THIS IS IMPACTED ME IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE I MADE SIX FIGURES A YEAR. ONCE I GOT HEALED IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I COULD NOT GO BACK TO MY JOB. THE JOB THAT I CREATED THE CONGLOMERATION OF PRINTING COMPANIES WHICH ENTAILED THIRTEEN DIFFERENT COMPANIES WHICH I WAS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD BUT MY DRECTORS WOULD NOT LET ME COME BACK TO WORK BECAUSE I WAS USING MEDICAL CANNABIS BECAUSE WE HAD FEDERAL CONTRACTS. THIS IS THIS IS SIMPLY DESTROYED MY LIFE AND MADE IT VERY HARD FOR ME TO SURVIVE IN LIFE BECAUSE I NOW CAN ONLY MAKE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR BECAUSE I'M FORCED TO GO WORK IN TH MEDICAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY BECAUSE MY INDUSTRY AFTER TWENTY YEARS WILL NO LONGER HIRE ME AND CONSIDERED A RISK. SO THIS IS VERY IMPERATIVE THAT WE MOVE FORWARD ON THIS AND THAT WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND WE FIGURE AN ADEQUATE WAY OF MEASURING TOLERANCES. THIS WITHOUT THAT. WE'RE DOOMED TO FAIL HER. AND WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD. AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE GRANT ACCESS THROUGH THE ENTIRE STATE. BECAUSE HAVE ACCESS. EVEN IN MY OWN COUNTY A PLASTER COUNTY WHERE WE SPENT EIGHTEEN MONTHS DOING SURVEYS WE HAD 73% APPROVAL RATE IN THAT COMMUNITY. TO MOVE FORWARD WITH CANNABIS BUT OR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DECIDED NOT TO MOVE FORWARD. SO WE NEED TO REMOVE THE STIGMA WE NEED TO STEP FORWARD WE NEED TO GET SOME ADEQUATE TESTING FOR TOLERANCES. AND TO MOVE FORWARD AND I APPRECIATE ALL YOUR TIME IN THE MOVING FORWARD THIS IS LONG OVERDUE. AND I AM VERY APPRECIATIVE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND THANKS FOR THE TESTIMONY OF TO AT THE- VERY INFORMATIVE THANK YOU. OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT.
