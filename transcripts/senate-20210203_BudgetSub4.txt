SHARE AND SENATOR NIELSEN MY NAME IS JENNIFER URBAN AND I AM THE CHIEF BUDGETS AND ACCOUNTING WITH THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS ASEAN'S TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUT TO CHANGE PROPOSALS. THE PERSON BEFORE YOU WAS ISSUE TWENTY THE CALIFORNIA STATE PAYROLL SYSTEM PROJECT. AS IT WAS REQUEST SIX POSITION. AND ONE WOMAN TERM. AN ASSOCIATED TO SOME THE CAL STATE HEROES. THROUGH THE CONTINUING OF THE COW DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY PROJECT APPROVAL LIFECYCLE THE RESOURCES WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE PROJECT ACTIVITIES THAT WILL DRIVE THE PROCESS OF ASSESSING OPTIONS AND DESIGNING A NEW ST MARTIN PERSONNEL AND PAYROLL SOLUTION. THREE CHALLENGE TO BE PROCUREMENT WHICH INCLUDE A PER CALLED PHASE. WE'RE HAPPY ANSWER ANY YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- ANY COMMENTS FOR FINANCE. WE SUPPORT THE CONTINUATION OF THIS PROJECT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY COMMENTS FROM THE OHIO. GOOD AFTERNOON BRIAN METZGER LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE WITHHOLD ACTION ON THESE BUDGET PROPOSALS UNTIL THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY APPROVES CRITICAL PLANNING DOCUMENTATION FOR THIS PROPOSED PROJECT. THE DOCUMENTATION WILL ALLOW OUR OFFICE TO MORE FULLY ASSESS AND RECOMMEND ACTION ON THESE PROPOSALS IN THE MEANTIME WE ALSO RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE THOROUGHLY EVALUATE THIS COMPLEX AND COSTLY PROJECT. THE PRELIMINARY BASELINE COST FOR THIS PROJECT IS APPROXIMATELY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND THE PRELIMINARY BASELINE SCHEDULE IS AT LEAST FIVE YEARS. THE LEGISLATURE COULD BEGIN TO EVALUATE THE PROJECT BY ASKING KEY QUESTIONS INCLUDING WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDED SOLUTION FOR THIS PROPOSED PROJECT AND WHAT OTHER SOLUTIONS WERE CONSIDERED. IN LIGHT OF THE STATE'S PROJECTED OUT YEAR DEFICITS IS NOW AN APPROPRIATE TIME TO EMBARK ON SUCH A COSTLY PROJECTS. AND HOW WILL BE ADMINISTRATION MITIGATE RISKS AND ADDRESS ISSUES TO AVOID THE OUTCOME OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY PROJECT WHICH IS THE PREDECESSOR TO THE PROPOSED C. S. P. S. I. T. PROJECT. THE LEGISLATURE COULD ALSO DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE A REPORT WITH ALL OF THE OPTIONS AND TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS CONSIDERED. AND THEIR ASSOCIATED PRELIMINARY COST SCHEDULE AND SCOPE. FINALLY WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE ESTABLISH AN OVERSIGHT FRAMEWORK FOR THIS PROPOSED PROJECT. THE LEGISLATURE COULD FOR EXAMPLE CONSIDER BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT REQUIRES MONTHLY OVERSIGHT MEETINGS WITH THE ADMINISTRATION AND OUR OFFICE ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATURE TO RECEIVE PROJECT UPDATES AND REVIEW OVERSIGHT DOCUMENTS. AS WELL AS POTENTIALLY QUARTERLY LEGISLATIVE BRIEFINGS TO UPDATE OTHER LEGISLATIVE STAFF ON THE PROPOSED PROJECT THIS FRAMEWORK COULD BE REVISITED ONCE THE PROPOSED PROJECT BEGINS DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. IF I COULD ASK THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE I ACTUALLY- APPRECIATE THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE L. A. AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU CAN ADDRESS THOSE QUESTIONS I WAS MY QUESTION WAS GOING TO BE HOW DOES THIS INTERFACE WITH FISCAL BUT I THINK IT- THE ISSUES RAISED BY THE L. A. R. R. R. R. PRETTY IMPORTANT GIVEN THIS. THE CHALLENGES WE'VE FACED WITH TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS IN THE PAST- COULD YOU PLEASE ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT THAT THE- L. A- RAISED. YES I CAN MANAGER MY NAME IS CHRIS MAYO AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PAYROLL SYSTEM PROJECT I COULD WALK THROUGH THEM TOP TO BOTTOM AND I ALSO- CONNECT YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT- HOW WILL INTERFACE WITH CISCO. SO WHY IS THIS YEAR PREPARE FOR PROPOSING YOUR REPLACE U. NINE CARE YOU. UNIFORMS APRIL SYSTEM. WELL QUITE SIMPLY TODAY'S SYSTEM FORTY FIVE OLD. IT WAS FIRST DEVELOPED BEFORE THE ADVENT OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN THE STATE. AND OVER THE PAST FOUR AND A HALF DECADES NEW PROCESSES HAVE BEEN DEFINED AND PERSONNEL AND PAYROLL SYSTEM HAS BEEN EXPANDED TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. THE EMPLOYEE POPULATION HAS GROWN AND THE COMPLEX PAYROLL RULES KEEP COMING. TODAY THERE ARE OVER THIRTY NUMBER THIRTEEN UNDERLYING SYSTEMS THAT COMPRISE THE OVERALL PAYROLL SYSTEM AND THEY'RE NOT VERY WELL INTEGRATED. THEY'RE NOT EASY TO OPERATE MAINTAIN AND THEY'RE VERY TIME CONSUMING TO CHANGE. SOME OF THE PRIMARY REASONS WE NEED TO REPLACE THE PAYROLL SYSTEM INCLUDE THE NEED TO HAVE. THE ABILITY FOR TIMELY IMPLEMENTATION OF CHANGES IN LAWS AND RULES RELATED TO PAYROLL AND PROCESSING OF- PERSONNEL ACTIONS. WE NEED AN EMPLOYEE SELF SERVICE AND MANAGER SELF SERVICE CAPABILITY THAT'S NOT CAPABLE- ACROSS OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS. WE NEED AUTOMATED DATA VALIDATION AND COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION CHECKS. IMPROVED ACCESS TO DATA REPORTING AND DATA ANALYTICS- CLEARLY WE NEED BETTER INTEGRATED BUSINESS PROCESSES ACROSS THE LINES OF BUSINESS THE PAYROLL SYSTEM ENCOMPASSES AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS INCLUDING OF COURSE A TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE REFRESH AGAIN THE SYSTEM IS FORTY FIVE YEARS OLD AS OF AS OF RIGHT NOW. WELL ALL THESE REASONS ARE GENERALLY EXISTED- SINCE THE NEED TO REPLACE THE PAYROLL SYSTEM WAS FIRST IDENTIFIED OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO- PRIOR CLAIMS ABOUT THE SYSTEM BEING ABLE TO CRASH- EXISTENCE- THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I SPEAK UP TODAY. THE SYSTEM IS NOT ABOUT TO CRASH AND IT'S THROUGH THE YOU KNOW THE GREAT EFFORTS OF THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE IT STAFF. AND THE STAFF OF THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY TO CONTINUE TO MAINFRAME MAINTAIN THE APPLICATIONS UNDERLYING ARCHITECTURE. NONE THE LESS THE SURVEY OF ALL THESE FOLKS INDICATE THAT 85% OF THEM AGREE THAT A NEW SYSTEM WOULD RESOLVE MANY OF THE LEGACY PAYROLL SYSTEM LIMITATIONS. SO THE SCO IS DETERMINED TO PROVIDE A BETTER MODERN PAYROLL SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES YOU IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE PROGRAM EFFICIENCIES AND A MUCH NEEDED TECHNOLOGY REFRESH. WHAT THANK YOU FOR THAT I DON'T THINK THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER WE NEED IT IT'S A QUESTION IS WHAT WHAT WHAT PROCESS SHOULD WE USED TO BROUGH PLACES AND AT LEAST THAT'S MY- THAT'S MY- AND YEAH I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT POINT OF MY QUESTION- SITE HERE IS YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD WE RECOMMEND THAT WE DO AT THIS POINT. THE RECOMMENDED SOLUTION IS FOR CS PS TO ACQUIRE AND COMMERCIAL OFF THE SHELF OFFICE- SISTER. THIS WOULD INVOLVE THE BRICK. AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A FULL HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. YOU MAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS INCLUDE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF SUPPORT ALL THE MAIN BUSINESS CAPABILITIES THAT ARE IN SCOPE FOR THE CSTS PROJECT INCLUDING. POSITION CONTROL PERSONNEL ADMINISTRATION BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION TIME AND ATTENDANCE ON OF COURSE PAYROLL. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS EMERGE FROM THE CLEAR ADVANTAGES PROVIDED BY TODAY'S COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS. ALONG WITH GIVING THE STATE THE BEST OPPORTUNITY TO MEET ALL OF ITS OBJECTIVES THE ADVANTAGES INCLUDE SIMPLIFIED TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE. A FASTER TIME TO BENEFIT. LEVERAGING THE EXPERTISE OF VENDORS WHO HAVE BEEN BUILDING NEW SYSTEMS FOR DECADES. AND THE A MUCH HIGHER USER ACCEPTANCE RATE. THE COSTS AROUND IN THIS APPROACH AS YOU HEARD IS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AND ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT WOULD BE INCLUSIVE OF THE SUBSCRIPTION FEES CLOUD HOSTING. IMPLEMENTATION OF ANCILLARY SERVICES. WE DID LOOK AT OTHER SOLUTIONS OF COURSE. ONE OF THE MAIN- SOLUTIONS WE LOOKED AT WAS THE ACTUALLY TO- COMPLETE THECONTINUE TO DEVELOP OUR CURRENT SYSTEM SO WHAT WE WOULD DO THERE IS AT ENHANCEMENTS TO IT TO DEVELOP A MODERN LOOK AND FEEL. AND- DEAL WITH SOME OF THE DATA VALIDATION RULES AND THINGS THAT WE HAD- IN THE PAST HOWEVER THAT SOLUTION DIDN'T MEET ALL OF THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROJECT AND IT WOULD CAUSE US TO NOT BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TRANSFORMATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO. OTHER SOLUTIONS NOT SPEAK BRIEFLY OF THEM ARE TO DEVELOP A CUSTOM SOLUTION. HOWEVER NO NO ONE STEPPED FORWARD DURING MARKET RESEARCH DID INDICATE THAT BUILDING A CUSTOM SOLUTION WOULD BE THE WAY TO GO- AGAIN THIS MARKET IS VERY MATURE NOW AND THERE'S THEIR SOLUTIONS THAT EXIST AND NO ONE WOULD NEED TO REWRITE THEM. BEST OF BREED IS ANOTHER OPTION WHERE YOU ACTUALLY BY. THE INDIVIDUAL- INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PROJECT AND THEN THE INTERFACE THEM. BUT AGAIN DURING MARKET RESEARCH WE ONLY HAD A HANDFUL OF FIRMS COME FORWARD AND THEY WOULD ONLY ADDRESS SPECIFIC LINES OF BUSINESSES AND THE STATE WOULD BE POSITION TO HAVE TO BE THE SYSTEMS INTEGRATOR TO TIE THEM ALL TOGETHER. AND FINALLY- AS IMPLEMENTATION OF THE S. A. P. PRODUCT. HOWEVER DURING CONSULTANT- DURING MARKET RESEARCH SAME THING NO ONE STEP FORWARD TO PROPOSE THAT WE DO THAT. AND THE SOFTWARE ITSELF IS NOW SEVERAL VERSIONS BEHIND AND REALLY JUST NOT A VIABLE OPTION. WELL THANK YOU FOR THAT I APPRECIATE THE- THE INFORMATION IT'S VERY VERY HELPFUL- AND THIS IS AN ITEM THAT WE WILL- THAT WILL REMAIN OPEN IN SAYING THAT THERE'S NO FURTHER QUESTION WILL MOVE ONTO THE NEXT ITEM. WHICH IS ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY ONE. LOCAL GOVERNMENT OVERSIGHT INTERNAL CONTROL REVIEWS. BERMAN THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE ZERO IS REQUESTING A SHIFT SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN REIMBURSEMENT FORTY TO GENERAL FUND SPECIAL ASSIGNMENT TO SUPPORT FIVE EXISTING RESOURCES TO PERFORM ONGOING INVESTIGATIVE REVIEWS IN THE OVERSIGHT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.

AT HOLLINGSHEAD WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE PROPOSAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THIS ITEM IS ALSO A HOLDOVER OPEN ITEM AND SEE NO QUESTIONS ALL MOVE ON TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. ISSUE NUMBER TWENTY TWO WHICH IS A CONTINUATION OF ENHANCED FRAUD INVESTIGATION AND PREVENTION ACTIVITIES. THE DEPARTMENT. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JULIE ACROSS AND I AM THE DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OVER THE ADMINISTRATION LICENSING AND SERVICES BRANCH OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE RCTI THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO OUTLINES OUR CONTINUATION OF ENHANCE FRAUD INVESTIGATION AND PREVENTION ACTIVITIES BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL FOR YOU TODAY. C. I. MONITORS AND PROSECUTE SEVERAL KEY CAM ACTIONS ALSO REFERRED TO AS A WHISTLEBLOWER CASES FILED UNDER THE INSURANCE FRAUDS PREVENTION ACT. PURSUANT TO CALIFORNIAN CHURCH SECTION EIGHTEEN SEVENTY ONE. TWENTY SEVEN HER THIS STATUTE ANY ASSESSMENTS AND FEES AWARDED ARE PAID TO THE GENERAL FUND. AND THE SAME STATUTE ALSO PROVIDES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO APPROPRIATE THESE FUNDS TO THE CBI FOR ENHANCED FRAUD INVESTIGATION EFFORTS. SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN AS A RESULT OF OUR EFFORTS HE CAN RECOVERIES ARE SETTLEMENT PAYMENTS HAVE TOTALED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE POINT TWO MILLION WITH OVER SIXTY SIX MILLION GOING TO THE GENERAL FUND. IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS HAS ALREADY BEEN RECOVERED AND DEPOSITED IN THE GENERAL FUND AS A RESULT OF OUR EFFORTS. SINCE FISCAL YEAR TWENTY FOURTEEN FIFTEN THE LEGISLATURE HAS APPROVED MULTIPLE ONE TIME REQUESTS TOTALING FIFTY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION IN AS MANY AS FIFTY LIMITED TERM POSITION. OR SENIORITY UTILIZE THESE FUNDS FOR ENHANCED FRAUD PREVENTION. INVESTIGATION WALDRON FINE RESOURCE WILLIS G. THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE THEREFORE CDI'S REQUESTING SIX POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO CONVERT THIRTY FOUR EXPIRING LIMITED TERM POSITIONS. TO PERMANENT POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THE CONTINUATION OF THESE EFFORTS THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE THE MONITORING AND- LITIGATION OF WHISTLEBLOWER CASES. INVESTIGATION OF SUSPECTED FRAUD WITH AN EMPHASIS ON CASES HAVING IN EXCESS OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN SUSPECTED LOSSES. AND ONGOING MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS ARE FRAUD DATA ANALYTICS SYSTEM WHICH WE IMPLEMENTED USING PRIOR GENERAL FUND RESOURCES. MADE POSSIBLE BY QUI TAM RECOVERIES ADDITIONALLY BEGINNING IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR. AND EVERY THREE FISCAL YEARS ARE AFTER REQUESTING SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND IN ORDER TO CONTINUE THE EDISCOVERY SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE SUBSCRIPTION AND THIS IS ANOTHER GREAT ENHANCEMENT THAT'S BEEN MADE POSSIBLE BY. GENERAL FUND RESOURCES AND OUR KEYCHAIN RECOVERIES. THE FINDINGS HE HAS REQUESTED WOULD COME FROM CD I WOULD COME FROM KEY TEN RECOVERIES SEE I COLLECTS AS A RESULT OF THE SUPPLEMENTS THAT ARE PAID TO THE GENERAL FUND. SO IN CONCLUSION THIS PROPOSAL WILL PROVIDE C. I. WITH THE SKILLED PERSONNEL AND VITAL TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN THIS PROGRAM. SECURING PERMANENT FUNDING WILL PROVIDE MORE CONTINUITY THE PROGRAM RESULTING IN MORE CASES BEING MONITORED AND MITIGATED. WHICH WILL RESULT IN A GREATER RETURN TO THE GENERAL FUND AS WELL AS BEING ABLE TO INVESTIGATE MORE FRAUD CASES. THIS IN TURN WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS BY PROTECTING THEM FROM FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES AND HELPS TO INSULATE CONSUMERS FROM THE ALTERNATE COSTS OF INSURANCE FRAUD. WHICH IS PASSED ON TO CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS IN THE FORM OF HIGHER INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND FEES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF OUR PROPOSAL WE'D. BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.

I'M GOING FUNDING IS APPROPRIATE IN LIGHT OF THE NON RECURRING NATURE OF THIS PARTICULAR SOURCE OF GENERAL FUND RIGHT NOW AND- BUT MEMBERS DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT PROVIDING ON GOING FUNDING THEN YOU COULD CONSIDER PROVIDING FUNDING ON A LIMITED TERM BASIS AS THE CITY'S DONE PRIOR YEARS. WE JUST NOTED THERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS- TO ALLOW ONGOING FUNDING WILL MAKING SURE THERE'S APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT- AND THAT THE- THAT THE- THE SETTLEMENT AND JUDGMENT FUNDS- CONTINUE TO COVER THE ONGOING EXPENSES IN LATER YEARS WITH SOME SORT OF REPORTING REQUIREMENT OR SOME OTHER MECHANISM MADE HAPPY BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH STUFF IF THAT.

WE ARE HERE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION BOB DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. TOMORROW JOHNSON DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE SUPPORT AT THE PROPOSAL MADAM CHAIR I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY IF I MADE THAT THE FIVE MILLION ALLOCATION IS PART OF THE EARLY ACTION PACKAGE AND THE EXAMINER TEN MILLION IS A TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT I APPRECIATE THAT. FOR THE TEN MILLION IS THE. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO. CORRECT GOT IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHELLO'S OFFICE. SORT OF BORED LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE BOMB WE FIND THAT THE CONCEPT OF USING ART TO PROMOTE PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGING HAS MERIT- HOWEVER WE FIND THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL KEY IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL- REMAIN UNANSWERED. ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTION WE HAVE IS WHO WOULD ADMINISTER THE GRANT AT THIS TIME ARTS COUNCIL'S TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER IT WOULD DIRECTLY ALLOCATE FUNDS TO- ARTISTS IN THE FIELD OR IT WOULD RELY ON LOCAL PARTNERS TO IDENTIFY AN ARTIST THAT WOULD RECEIVE THE GRANTS. OR IF THE GRANT WOULD BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF THESE TWO SIR- APPROACHES ON THERE'S VARIOUS PROS AND CONS TO EITHER OF THESE APPROACHES FOR EXAMPLE AT THE ARTS COUNCIL ADMINISTERED IT ADDING MORE STATEWIDE LEVEL YOU COULD EXPECT GREATER UNIFORMITY. OR IS IT WAS ALLOCATED MORE BY LOCAL PARTNERS- D. INDIVIDUALS ACTUALLY AWARDING THE GRANT MIGHT HAVE MORE INSIGHT INTO pTARGETED. IN EITHER CASE THE LEGISLATURE IS GOING TO WANT TO GET CLARITY FROM ARTS COUNCIL ON HOW IT'S GOING TO ADMINISTER THE GRANT. IN ADDITION- WHILE LEAD COUNSEL HAS INDICATED- AS YOU HEARD THAT FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE TARGETED AT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED INCLUDING HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES- THERE'S A LOT ABOUT THE ALLOCATION PROCESS THAT WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT. SUCH AS WHAT OTHER CRITERIA WOULD BE CONSIDERED AND HOW THESE CRITERIA WOULD BE WEIGHED AGAINST EACH OTHER THIS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE IT WOULD HELP THE LEGISLATURE IDENTIFY WHETHER OR NOT THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE TARGETED IN A WAY THAT WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE. TO ADDRESS CODE NINETEEN. ANOTHER QUESTION IS HOW PEOPLE WOULD BE FIVE GRANT- YOU HEARD. OF THAT COUNCILS HOPING TO WORK WITH- AROUND FIVE HUNDRED ARTISTS REPRESENTING ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. HOWEVER AT THIS POINT IT'S DIFFICULT TO ASSESS HOW MANY PEOPLE MIGHT ENCOUNTER THE ARTWORK THAT WOULD BE SUPPORTED. AND THAT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO COMPARE THIS STRATEGY AGAINST OTHER STRATEGIES THAT MIGHT CONSIDER TO GET OUT PUBLIC HEALTH MESSAGES LIKE ADVERTISING. IT'S ALSO A BIT UNCLEAR EXACTLY HOW THE MATCHING ELEMENTS OF THE GRANT PROGRAM WOULD WORK AND IT WE THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO GET CLARITY ON THISASPECT OF THE PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT IT DOESN'T. CERTAINLY LIMIT WHICH ARTISTS ARE ABLE TO. PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. ALL AT THIS TIME WE FIND THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD WITHHOLD ACTION ON THE PROPOSAL UNTIL THESE KEY IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED HOWEVER IF THESE QUESTIONS ARE ANSWERED TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE LEGISLATURE FINDS THAT ON THIS COULD BE A COST EFFECTIVE WAY OF GETTING OUT HEALTH MESSAGING WE RECOMMEND APPROVAL OBVIOUSLY. ARE THESE QUESTIONS REMAIN UNANSWERED OR THE ANSWERS ARE NOT TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE LEGISLATURE WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE I USE THIS FUNDING IN OTHER WAYS I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR OUR COMMENT- SO I JUST WANNA BY SECOND AT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY THE L. A. O. FOR THE ARTS COUNCIL- I THINK- I AM I A SUPPORT THE ARTS ND I THINK THEY'RE IMPORTANT IN OUR COMMUNITY FOR SO MANY REASONS AND- RIGHT NOW. THERE'S A REAL LACK OF HOPE IN THE COMMUNITY- THE BACKS AND BAXEEN QUITE FRANKLY OUR- OUR THE ONE BRIGHT LIGHT ADDED ADDED THESE PAST. TEN OR ELEVEN MONTHS- BUT I AM CONCERNED AND REPRESENTING A RURAL RURAL AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT. WITH LOTS OF MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES UP THE MY EXPERIENCE IS THAT THE FUNDS DON'T END UP GETTING DOWN TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT FOR THE MOST PART- ART. TENDS TO BE- SEEN AS A AT EIGHT AM. A FEATURE OF MORE WEALTHY COMMUNITIES AND YOU SEE A LOT MORE INVESTMENT IN THOSE WEALTHY COMMUNITIES RATHER THAN IN- DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I'M I'M GONNA NEED A LOT MORE INFORMATION AND I'D LIKE IF YOU COULD- TO- GET TO THE% THIS COMMITTEE A LIST OF THE DIFFERENT PROJECTS THAT YOU HAVE HELP TO FIND IN PAST YEARS SO THAT WE CAN GET AN IDEA OF THE KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT. HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING FROM THE ARTS COUNCIL AND WHERE THEY'RE LOCATED- AND HOW MUCH HAS BEEN INVESTED IN THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT MIGHT TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHETHER. THE RESOURCES THAT ARE IN THIS GRANT APPLICATION OUR OUR RESOURCES THAT SHOULD GO TO THE ARTS COUNCIL AS OPPOSED. TO GOING THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR EXAMPLE TO COMMUNITIES ON THROUGH THEIR SCHOOLS OR SOME OTHER MECHANISM THAT- THAT MAKES SENSE IN TERMS OF THIS STATE STATE GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT I THINK WE SHOULD INVEST THIS MONEY I GUESS THAT'S MY FIRST PART BUT BUT THIS IS A HOLLOW OPEN ITEM AND I'D FOUND BY AYE I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY THE L. A- IF YOU COULD IN TERMS OF WHO WOULD ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM. LOCAL PARTNERS OR YOURSELF- HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT MATCHED THE MATCHING GRANTS DON'T RESTRICT. COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE A HARD TIME RAISING THE MONEY TO DO A MATCH. AND AND HOW YOU AND INVASION. REALLY GETTING INTO MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES IT MAY NOT HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE BY WAY OF A ARTS COUNCIL OR A- OR- A REAL ACTIVE- ORGANIZATION HOW DO YOU FIND WHEN THAT THAT DOESN'T OCCUR IN A COMMUNITY. IT WAS THAT IT WASN'T A QUESTION YES. YES IT WAS A FAIRLY LONG QUESTION I APOLOGIZE. RIGHT JUST TODAY TO MAKE SURE ANSWER NOW WITH THE CLARITY THAT YOU WANT WE HAVE PARTNERS IN OUR FIFTY EIGHT OF THAT OUT. IN FIFTY FOUR OUT OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. DOWN THAT OUR COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS DESIGNATED. ARTS COUNCILS AND THEN THE THEN WE REACH OUT TO THE OTHER COUNTIES THROUGH OUR- COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS WITH ADJACENT COUNTIES GEOGRAPHY MATTERS TO US RURAL- GEOGRAPHY MATTERS TO US TREMENDOUSLY IT'S ONE OF THE COUNCIL'S PRIORITIES. AND THAT IS A PRIORITY OF THIS PROJECT AS WELL IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WERE- WE'RE SO EXCITED ABOUT THIS IS BECAUSE IT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY WHEN I SAY MICRO TARGETED. TO GO TO THOSE RURAL COMMUNITIES FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE ARE THAT HAVE VERY RICH CULTURAL ARTS. WITH THE IN THEM NOT THE FINE ARTS IN THE FANCY GALLERIES BUT THE YOU KNOW THE CULTURAL ARTS AND BE ABLE TO SPEAK IN THAT VOICE TO THOSE COMMUNITIES. WHETHER YOU KNOW BE- HISPANIC OR LATINO OR- NATIVE AMERICAN YOU KNOW TO BE BIRDS ON THE GROUND AT THIS. YEAH MESSAGING SOME. IT IS THE INTENT TO REACH THE WHOLE STATE IN EVERY COUNTY AND NOT BE TOP DOWN MESSAGING BECAUSE WE FEEL VERY DEEPLY THAT IT WOULD BE MORE EFFECTIVE. VERY GOOD WELL THIS IS A HOLD OPEN ITEM SO I EXPECT WE'LL WE'LL SEE YOU BACK AGAIN- IN TERMS OF THAT- WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE IN THE PAST IF YOU COULD GET US ANY INFORMATION ON THAT THAT WOULD BE GRETLY APPRECIATED.

THIS PROJECT WILL IMPLEMENT A NEW LONG TERM CARE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD SYSTEM AND ALL EIGHT VETERANS HOMES OF CALIFORNIA. AND OUR HEADQUARTERS OFFICE. THIS REQUEST IS FOR A ONE TIME AUGMENTATION OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND FOR THE SECOND YEAR OF IMPLEMENTATION. THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS INCLUDES NINE POINT SIX MILLION FOR PRIMARY VENDOR CONTRACT.

IN REGARDS TO THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE PROJECT DIFFICULT IMPACTS WE HAVE EXPERIENCE SCHEDULE DELAYS. NO HOMES HAVE IMPLEMENTED THUS FAR. WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PLANNING PHASE. TO DATE NO PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE VENDOR BECAUSE THE INITIAL SET OF DELIVERABLES ARE ZERO COST DELIVERABLES. WITH OUR EXECUTIVE STEERING COMMITTEE SUPPORT WE HAVE BEGUN AN EFFORT TO RE BASELINE OR PROJECT SCHEDULE. WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THIS WILL RESULT IN A SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT. EXCUSE ME WE DO EXPECT THAT THIS EFFORT WILL RESULT IN A SPECIAL PROJECT REPORT SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY. AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT KNOW THE FULL IMPACTS OF THIS CHANGE.
