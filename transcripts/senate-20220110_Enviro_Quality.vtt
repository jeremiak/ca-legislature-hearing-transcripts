MOVE IT. FIVE FOR A DISCUSSION

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.402
OF THAT I'M YOU KNOW WHAT SOME

00:17:16.468 --> 00:17:18.303
PEOPLE MIGHT SAY WHY DO WE NEED

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:20.139
TO DECLARE AN EMERGENCY AND I

00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:21.940
THINK THE ANALYSIS GIVES A GOOD.

00:17:22.007 --> 00:17:25.010
EXAMPLE THAT WE HAVE NOT YET

00:17:25.077 --> 00:17:27.045
DECLARED THIS AS AN EMERGENCY

00:17:27.112 --> 00:17:28.547
WHILE WE REFERRED TO THE CLIMATE

00:17:28.614 --> 00:17:31.617
CRISIS WE'VE NOT STATUTORILY OR

00:17:31.683 --> 00:17:34.653
OTHERWISE DONE SO AND IT DOES

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.823
ENABLE CERTAIN ACTIONS THAT IN

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:39.792
QUICKER THAN- CAN BE NONE

00:17:39.858 --> 00:17:42.060
OTHERWISE. AND I THINK AT THIS

00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:43.662
POINT IN TIME IT IS ABSOLUTELY

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:45.330
RIGHT TO DO SO BECAUSE I THINK

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:47.466
FOR MANY OF US. IF WE TAKE IS

00:17:47.533 --> 00:17:49.401
THIS THE KIND OF FUNNY ANALOGY

00:17:49.468 --> 00:17:51.203
BUT IF WE TAKE WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.172
RIGHT NOW WITH THE PANDEMIC.

00:17:53.238 --> 00:17:54.907
WE'VE GOT A GOOD PERCENT OF

00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:56.642
PEOPLE EITHER VACCINATED OR

00:17:56.708 --> 00:17:59.077
UNVACCINATED WHO FEEL LIKE OKAY

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:01.180
THE- YOU KNOW COVER IT'S GOING

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:03.248
TO BE PART OF US SO YOU KNOW I'M

00:18:03.315 --> 00:18:05.017
DONE LIKE THIS WE'RE GONNA HAVE

00:18:05.083 --> 00:18:07.719
TO LIVE WITH IT. ENDEARS WITHOUT

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:09.655
THINKING ABOUT NECESSARILY

00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:12.391
WEIGHING FULLY THE CONSEQUENCES

00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:15.194
OF WHO IT MAY STILL REALLY HARM

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.463
AND I THINK FOR THE CLIMATE

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:20.833
CRISIS FOR MANY PEOPLE. WE'VE ME

00:18:20.899 --> 00:18:22.568
WHILE THEY'RE STILL DENIERS

00:18:22.634 --> 00:18:24.436
WE'VE BEEN IN THE MIDST OF IT

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:28.507
AND IT'S SO- REAL RIGHT NOW THAT

00:18:28.574 --> 00:18:31.276
IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE'RE NEAR TO

00:18:31.343 --> 00:18:34.379
IT. AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO BE WE

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:37.516
CANNOT AFFORD TO BE- I MEAN I

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:39.017
FOUND MYSELF AS SOMEONE WHO

00:18:39.084 --> 00:18:40.452
WORKED FOR SPECIALLY IN THIS

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:41.954
FIELD I WAS ONE OF THE EARLY

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.089
ACTORS IN THIS AREA STARTING

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:46.091
BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY. AND

00:18:46.158 --> 00:18:47.860
I'VE GOTTEN TO THE POINT NOW

00:18:47.926 --> 00:18:54.066
WHERE IT'S- FOR MANY YEARS AGO.

00:18:54.132 --> 00:18:55.534

SORRY PASSED. THAT WE CAN NOT WE

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:05.644
CANNOT INTERNALIZED DEFEAT ON.

00:19:05.711 --> 00:19:08.514
WE STILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:09.515
TURN IT AROUND BUT IT WOULD

00:19:09.581 --> 00:19:12.150
REQUIRE THAT TYPE OF ACTION THAT

00:19:12.217 --> 00:19:14.520
DECLARING IT AN EMERGENCY WOULD

00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:17.489
TAKE. SO I WANT TO THANK SENATOR

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:19.558
MCGUIRE FOR DOING THAT I HOPE

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:22.427
THAT IT REALLY DOES- CAUSES TO

00:19:22.494 --> 00:19:24.296
ACT IN THAT KIND OF EMERGENCY

00:19:24.363 --> 00:19:27.866

PERSON CAN CAN BE LIKE THE

00:20:17.215 --> 00:20:19.084
ALARMS GOING OFF BUT I CAN HIT

SENATOR SKINNER ON THAT POINT-

00:20:27.225 --> 00:20:29.695
OF HOW MUCH OF AN ALARM WE CAN

00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:31.797
TAKE. I DO WONDER IN TERMS OF.

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:34.666
WHERE HOW TO ACTUALLY GET

00:20:34.733 --> 00:20:36.802
SOMETHING OUT OF THIS RESOLUTION

00:20:36.868 --> 00:20:39.004
TO FURTHER THE- URGENCY. I MEAN

00:20:39.071 --> 00:20:40.872
WHEN YOU WHEN WE USE THE WORD

00:20:40.939 --> 00:20:42.841
EMERGENCY IN THIS CASE DO YOU

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:44.810
THINK OF IT AS AN EMERGENCY LIKE

00:20:44.876 --> 00:20:46.945
. OTHER EMERGENCIES AN

00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:49.414
EARTHQUAKE OR WILDFIRE IN

00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:51.984
PANDEMIC I MEAN WHEN WE'RE

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.519
DECLARING THAT EMERGENCY. SHOULD

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:56.154
SHOULD WE UNDERSTAND IN THOSE

00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:58.991

YOU SO MUCH AND- SKINNER BOTH

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:04.696
YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS CRITICAL

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:06.932
ISSUE SO NUMBER ONE I THINK IS

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:09.468
VERY SIMILAR TO- ANY OTHER TYPE

00:21:09.534 --> 00:21:12.037
OF EMERGENCY I THINK THE BIGGEST

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:13.505
DIFFERENCES. THIS IS ONGOING.

00:21:13.572 --> 00:21:15.774
IT'S GOING TO GET WORSE. AS BAD

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:18.110
AS OUR FIRES ARE- THEY

00:21:18.176 --> 00:21:19.878
EVENTUALLY ARE ABLE TO PUT THAT

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:21.713
FIRE OUT FOR THAT COMMUNITY.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.117
THIS IS ONGOING. AND THE ALARM

00:21:25.183 --> 00:21:28.053
BELLS COULDN'T BE LOUDER. SO I

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.254
THINK THE STATE HAS ALREADY

00:21:29.321 --> 00:21:30.489
STARTED THANKS TO YOUR

00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:32.124

SARAH CASKEY IS WELL I PUT IN

00:21:35.394 --> 00:21:36.128
FIFTEEN BILLION IN REGARDS TO

00:21:36.194 --> 00:21:37.863
THAT RESPONSE TO THIS CRIME

00:21:37.929 --> 00:21:40.532
EMERGENCY. BOTH ARE PREPARING

00:21:40.599 --> 00:21:42.000
CAN COASTAL COMMUNITIES FOR

00:21:42.067 --> 00:21:44.202
MANAGED ETREAT. FOR WILDFIRE

00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:46.605
RESPONSE FOR REFORESTATION FOR

00:21:46.672 --> 00:21:49.207
DROUGHT OUT FOR COOLING CENTERS

00:21:49.274 --> 00:21:50.809
THE GOVERNOR'S GONNA PROPOSE OF

00:21:50.876 --> 00:21:52.344
I BELIEVE ABOUT ANOTHER TWENTY

00:21:52.411 --> 00:21:53.979
FIVE BILLION THIS YEAR. NOT FOR

00:21:54.046 --> 00:21:55.681
THIS EMERGENCY THAT WE'RE FACING

00:21:55.747 --> 00:21:57.916
RIGHT NOW- AND THIS IS GOING TO

00:21:57.983 --> 00:22:00.752
HAVE TO BE ON GOING. SO I DO

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:04.056
AGREE THAT WE BECOME NUMB. THE

00:22:04.122 --> 00:22:08.126
NEWS- AROUND THIS PLANET. HAS

00:22:08.193 --> 00:22:10.362
NOT BEEN GOOD WHEN IT COMES TO

CLIMATE. AND WE'RE OVERWHELMED

00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:13.198
WITH THE PANDEMIC. THAT MEANS WE

00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:14.433
NEED TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS

00:22:14.499 --> 00:22:16.268
HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND BUILD

00:22:16.334 --> 00:22:18.203

00:24:12.517 --> 00:24:14.319
FIFTY YEARS AGO WE ESTABLISHED.

00:24:14.386 --> 00:24:16.288

AND WE NEED TO HAVE THE CURB BUT

00:27:08.326 --> 00:27:10.161
WE'RE DOING IT HERE IN

00:27:10.228 --> 00:27:11.162
CALIFORNIA AS WE'RE EXPORTING

00:27:11.229 --> 00:27:13.732
JOBS. TO OTHER COUNTRIES THAT

00:27:13.798 --> 00:27:16.234

00:27:27.012 --> 00:27:28.747
MATTER OF YOU KNOW PUTTING FEAR

00:27:28.813 --> 00:27:30.048

00:27:53.271 --> 00:27:55.006
AN AUDIT LAST YEAR SAYING THAT

00:27:55.073 --> 00:27:56.641
DEBT REDUCTION OF CARBON REALLY

00:27:56.708 --> 00:27:58.243

BILLION DOLLARS. FOR

00:28:23.134 --> 00:28:24.302
FIREFIGHTING THAT'S FOR FIRE

00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:25.703
