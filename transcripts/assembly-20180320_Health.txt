WILL BE BRIEF IN THE INTEREST OF THE COMMITTEE. I AB TWENTY EIGHTY EIGHT HOW WOULD GIVE MINERS ABILITY REQUEST THEIR OWN RESTATEMENTS BE ADDED TO THEIR. TREATMENT RECORDS UNDER CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAW MINERS. OF THE AGE TWELVE OR OLDER CAN CONSENT TO THEIR OWN TREATMENT WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS. MINERS ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT TO INSPECT THEIR OWN RECORDS WITH THIS WOULD ALLOW THE DO IS FOR A MINOR. DID GIVE A STATEMENT TO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY WORDS IN LENGTH ARE ON THEIR RECORDS WHEN THEY BELIEVE THE RECORDS INCOMPLETE. OR IN ACCURATE WITH ME HAVE TWO WITNESSES. WHO ALSO SPEAK? GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS SARA JASPER AND WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF MARRIAGE AND FAMILY THERAPISTS. AND ASK HIM STAFF ATTORNEY I SPEAK WITH A PROVIDERS TO WORK WITH MINORS WHO ARE FACING REALLY DIFFICULT ISSUES IN THEIR LIVES. AND IN FACT. SOMETIMES IS MINERS HAVE TO CONSENT FOR THEIR OWN TREATMENT. BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT. THIS LEGISLATION WOULD GIVE MINORS WHEN NECESSARY. AND IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES TO GIVE CONTEXT TO THEIR TREATMENT RECORDS RECORDS THAT HAVE THE. POTENTIAL TO FOLLOW THEM AND IMPACT THE COURSE OF THEIR LIVES. RECENT EXAMPLES OF THIS INCLUDE A SITUATION WHERE A SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD WAS CONSIDERING MILITARY SERVICE AND SHE WAS IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. SHE HAD BEEN TO NUMEROUS HOMES THEREFORE. WITH NUMEROUS TREATMENT PROVIDERS AND THERE WERE. DISCREPANCIES AS TO VARYING IN CONFLICTING DIAGNOSES. IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE CONTEXT TO THE RECORD BEFORE IT WENT TO THE MILITARY. UNFORTUNATELY THE LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THAT TO OCCUR. ANOTHER EXAMPLE. EIGHTEEN RECENTLY HAD CHANGED PROVIDERS. AND SHE ASKED TO SEE THE RECORD WHEN SHE INSPECTED THE RECORD SHE NOTED THAT. THE PREVIOUS THERAPIST IN INDICATED THAT SHE HAD TAKEN A DRUG THAT SHE HAD NEVER USED SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. INACCURACIES SUCH AS THOSE ARE PRETTY IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO. EFFECTS. AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. I'M GVA AIR SIGNS THAT. CRIME REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION FOR LICENSED PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL COUNSELORS.

AND LAY RESCUERS TO RESUSCITATE VICTIMS OF DROWNING. IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN CONSULTATION WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO ISSUE BEST PRACTICES GUIDELINES RELATED TO PULL SAFETY AT KATE THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS. ADDITIONAL COSTS IMPOSED BY THIS BILL COULD BECOME CANDY COVERED A PUBLIC SCHOOLS FOR THEIR DOOR DO DIRECT FEES IF A SCHOOL WISHES TO INCLUDE A E. D.

I WITH THE AMENDMENTS WOULD IMPROVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN CALIFORNIA PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL ESTABLISHING THE DEADLINE. FOR THE PART IN A PUBLIC HEALTH TO AGGREGATE OF THE DATA WILL HEALTH OFFICERS ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT CASES OF VALLEY FEVER TO CDP H.. THINK OF TALKING TO ALMOST EVERY YEAR. EVERY MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE ABOUT VALLEY FEVER AND KIND OF WHAT IT'S. WHAT IT'S MEANT NOT ONLY TO THE VALLEY BUT JUST RESIDENTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THAT FIFTY OUT OF THE FIFTY? I COUNTIES DO HAVE REPORTED CASES THAT THEY REPORTED WE KNOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA I THAT THE CDC CENTER ESTIMATES OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND CASES GO UNREPORTED EVERY YEAR. SIXTY PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE THAT KNOW THAT HAVE VALLEY FEVER DON'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE IT WE KNOW THERE'S NO VACCINE THERE'S NO CURE.

BUT IS AN EPIDEMIC THAT IS QUICKLY SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS BILL IS A FUNDAMENTAL MEASURETHEN SURE STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE COLLABORATING AND WORKING OFF THE SAME INFORMATION. IN SPEAKING WITH LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS WE FOUND THAT THERE IS INCONSISTENT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS AND THE STATE WHENEVER PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT MAKES CHANGES TO HE VALLEY FEVER STATE OUR DATA IT RECEIVES. AS A RESULT THE STATE AND COUNTIES ARE OFTEN AT ODDS WITH THE NUMBER OF VALLEY FEVER CASES REPORTED. FIGHTING AGAINST THIS DISEASE REQUIRES OUR STATE AND LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES TO WORK TOGETHER TO BRING EVERY AVAILABLE RESOURCE TO HEALTH AUTHORITIES FIGHTING VALLEY% FEVER. ON THE FRONT LINES EACH AND EVERYDAY. THIS BILL HAS BEEN A PARTNERSHIP EFFORT WITH A LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES AND WE HOPE TO BRING MORE ATTENTION AND RESOURCES IN OUR EFFORTS TO BRING A TREATMENT AND CURE FOR VALLEY FEVER VICTIMS. WITH US THE TESTIFIED TODAY IN SUPPORT IS PROPERTY VICE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD AT VALLEY FEVER OF AMERICA'S FOUNDATION AND A VALUE FOR SURVIVOR. SOME WOMEN FONG HAVE MY NAME IS ROBERT PRETTY AND I'M A SIX YEAR SURVIVOR OF THE VALLEY FEVER. MENINGITIS WHEN THE VALLEY FEVER. I AM ONE OF THE. MEMBERS OF A FAMILY THAT WAS DEEPLY IMPACTED BY THIS DISEASE MISTER SPOCK SOLACE THAT.

EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO I JOIN THE VALLEY FEVER AMERICA'S FOUNDATION IN JANUARY I WAS ELECTED VICE PRESIDENT UP FOR. VALLEY FEVER AMERICA'S FOUNDATION IS AN ALL VOLUNTEER FOUNDATION THAT EVOLVED FROM THE ROTARY INTERNATIONAL VALLEY FEWER VACCINE PROJECT. IN THE LATE NINETIES. FOR TWENTY YEARS WE'VE SUPPORTED A VACCINE FOR VALLEY FEVER OVER TIME OUR MISSION HAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE SEEKING A CURE THINK COMMUNITY AWARENESS. WE HAVE TAKEN A STRONG. POSITION OF SUPPORT ON ALL THE VALLEY FEVER BILLS BEAT BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY OFFER SMART MAJOR IMPROVEMENT. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN SPECIFICALLY IMPROVE THE FLOW OF INFORMATION BETWEEN THE STATE AND COUNTIES BY REQUIRING. EXAMPLE THAT CHANGES MADE BY THE STATE TO THE NUMBERS REPORTED BY THE COUNTIES. HE COMMUNICATED BACK TO THOSE COUNTIES. THE GREATER THE VARIANCE BETWEEN STATE AND COUNTY NUMBERS THE LESS WEIGHT AND ATTENTION THEY WILL BE GIVEN WHEN THIS BODY OR ANY ENTITY REVIEWS. ACCURATE NUMBERS BEGIN WITH GOOD GUIDELINES. AND THAT IS WHAT AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN STRIVE TO CREATE. AND THAT IS WHY I AM ASKING THIS COMMITTEE FOR AN AYE VOTE ON THE BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OTHERS IN SUPPORT. ARTS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE HELP OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WHERE SAY WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE A POSITION. ON ANY THE VALLEY FEVER LEGISLATION BEING CONSIDERED TODAY. BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO BE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER MINUTES IS A BILLS BEFORE.

MISS WALDRON THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND ALL THE OTHER BILLS.

AND THANK YOU FOR OP ED IN YOUR LOCAL PAPER. ANYONE ELSE. WAS ONE OF THANK YOU I THINK WE'RE BRING THE BILL SUPPORT I THINK YOU FOR YOUR PERSISTENCE ON THIS ISSUE I KNOW YOU AND WORKING ON THIS FOR AWHILE. I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR'S WERE TOGETHER ON THIS AND TOGETHER TO. CREATE A SINGLE SINGLE UNIFIED PACKAGE ON THIS SITE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THE BILL DOES AND JOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION SO ONCE WE HAVE A QUORUM. WILL TAKE A VOTE ON THAT. WE'LL LET YOU GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO YOUR NEXT BILL AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. THANK YOU THIS IS A PART OF THAT WAS SURE THIS IS PART OF THE VALLEY FEVER PACKAGE ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT ADDRESSES THE LAB TESTING. ONE OF THINGS THAT WE FOUND OUT WHEN WE WERE. DELVING INTO ALL OF THIS WAS FOR SOME REASON ONE WOULD YOU TEST POSITIVE A LAB TEST TEST POSITIVE FOR VALLEY FEVER. WAS ENCOUNTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WHICH IS WHY CDC SAYS OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CASES EVERY YEAR GO UNREPORTED. SO WANT THINGS WE WANT TO DO IS TO CORRECT THAT SO THAT WE CAN GET THE RESOURCES A DEDICATED TOWARDS VALLEY FEVER THAT WE NEED. SO WITH THIS LEGISLATION SAYS WANT TO TEST POSITIVE FOR VALLEY FEVER THROUGH A LAB TEST THEN WE'RE GONNA GO AND COUNT THOSE NUMBERS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. WE'VE SEEN OTHER STATES LIKE THE STATE OF ARIZONA MOVE TO THIS MODEL IT'S NINETY SEVEN PERCENT ACCURATE IN THE STATE OF ARIZONA BY MOVING TO THIS MODEL. I FOR SOME REASON IN CALIFORNIA WE REQUIRE ADDITIONAL. STEPS AND I WOULD SAY BARRIERS TO ACTUALLY COUNTING. OF VALLEY FEVER CASES IN THIS LEGISLATION SEEKS TO ADDRESS THAT. AND CORRECT THAT. THOSE ISSUES. PRODUCT. IT'S ABOUT. LOOK QUICKLY THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AT THAT JUST BRIEFLY TO WHAT. CINNAMON SOLACE OR SAID BYLINE POSITIVE LAB TESTS TO CONFIRM VALUE THE CASES AT THIS BILL WILL REDUCE UNDER REPORTING AND GREECE ACCURACY ENHANCE MONITORING. AND SURVEILLANCE OF THIS DISEASE AT THIS METHOD HAS BEEN ADOPTED IN ARIZONA AND HAS LED TO INCREASE IN TIMELINESS OF CASE REPORTING TOGETHER THESE BILLS I REPRESENT POSITIVE SOLUTIONS THAT WILL COME FROM A COORDINATED EFFORT AMONG FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS. TO LEVERAGE THE BEST IDEAS IN OUR FIGHT AGAINST VALLEY FEVER. AND AGAIN WITH US TESTIFIES ROB PRETTY VICE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF THE VALUE OF AMERICAN STUDIES. AS I SAID MY NAME'S ROBBERY AND I'M. FELLOW FEWER SURVIVOR AND VICE PRESIDENT BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF ALPHA REMARKS FINISH WITH ACTUALLY THE ONLY NONPROFIT. FAUCET FOCUSED EXCLUSIVELY ON VALLEY FEVER PARA CALIFORNIA. AND I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH WOULD REMOVE THE CLINICAL CONFIRMATION REQUIREMENT. FOR ACCOUNTABLE DIAGNOSIS OF VALLEY FEVER CURRENTLY THE STATE REQUIRES ALL LABS TO REPORT POSITIVE VALLEY FEVER TEST IT ONLY COUNTS THOSE THAT HAVE A CLINICAL CONFIRMATION. REMOVING THE CLINICAL CONFIRMATION WILL ACTUALLY INCREASE THE ACCURACY OF THE CASE CALVET VALLEY FEVER. FOR CALIFORNIA IN THE COUNTY'S MOST AFFECTED BY VALLEY FEVER THE MOUNT OF FALL IT NECESSARY TO CLINICALLY CONFIRM VALLEY FEVER IS INSURMOUNTABLE. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. FOR ALL OF ARIZONA THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY THREE THOUSAND VALLEY FEVER LABORATORY TESTS. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN KERN COUNTY ALONE THAT NUMBER WAS ALMOST TWENTY THOUSAND. IN THE COUNTY'S MOST AFFECTED BY VALLEY FEVER THE CLINICAL CONFIRMATION REQUIREMENT TAKES HOURS UPON HOURS TO ACCOMPLISH. IN THE COUNTY'S LEAST IMPACTED BY VALLEY FEVER THE PROBLEMS DIFFERENT. I HAD A CONVERSATION IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR WITH A FRIEND OF MINE. ABOUT A COUNTY. THAT WAS REPORTING ONE CASE OF VALLEY FEVER WHERE HE PERSONALLY KNEW AND RECALL. BEING AWARE OF HALF A DOZEN CASES IN THAT SAME COUNTY. CALIFORNIA HAS REQUIRED LAST REPORT VALLEY FEVER SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN AND THEY DO A GOOD JOB OF IT. REMOVING THE IMPEDIMENT OF CLINICAL CONFIRMATION WILL ACTUALLY INCREASE ACCURACY AND ALLOW A MORE ACCURATE COUNT OF THOSE OF US SUFFERING WITH THIS DISEASE. FOR THAT REASON I AM ASKING FOR AYE VOTE.

OVER THE CURRENT CAP OF THIRTY HOURS PER WEEK AND THIS IS PART OF AN ONGOING PACKAGE OF LEGISLATION THAT I'VE BROUGHT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS TO. TRYING TO ADDRESS THE. CRISIS OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND RURAL CALIFORNIA. MISS CHAIR KNOW YOUR DISTRICT FOR SOMEONE MIND SUFFER XIN SOME OF THE SAME ISSUES POSITION TO PATIENT RATIO AND AVAILABILITY OF HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND. ALTHOUGH WE'VE DONE A GREAT DEAL I IN THE PAST DECADE TO MAKE HEALTH INSURANCE AND COVERAGE. MORE ACCESSIBLE AND MORE WIDELY AVAILABLE ARE PEOPLE LIVING IN RURAL COMMUNITIES STILL. SUFFER FROM A LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND CLINICS IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND THIS BILL WOULD GIVE TEN ADDITIONAL HOURS OF OPERATION TO THESE INTERNET CLINICS ARE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE RURAL CALIFORNIA AND.

I GOOD AFTERNOON MONEY HIS PAUL SOURCE AND I'M THE CEO OF CAMERON HEALTH COMMITTEE HEALTH CENTER SERVING. MADERA COUNTY. HERE. IN SUPPORT. OF THIS BILL. ONE I THINK I'D START BY POINTING OUT IS REALLY AS WE LOOK TO. BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN INTERMITTENT CLINICS IN THE FULLY LICENSES THAT. REALLY LOOKING TO. REDEFINE WHAT WE CONSIDERED THE FULL TIME WHEN LOOKING AT GREENHOUSE THAN OURS. IF YOU LOOK AT MOST LIKELY HEALTH MINISTER OF THE STATE WERE OPERATING IN EXCESS OF SEVENTY EIGHTY HOURS A WEEK. LARGELY BECAUSE WE'RE MANY TIMES THE ONLY RESOURCE FOR FOR HEALTHCARE IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND SO WERE SERVING. MANY FOLKS WRITING TO BE OPEN EVENINGS WEEKENDS AND AS MEDI CAL CONTINUES TO EXPAND WHICH WE THINK IS FANTASTIC. AND COVERAGE EXPANDS. THE NEED FOR SERVICES ALSO FOLLOW SUIT AND SO. AS WE LOOK TO BRIDGE THAT GAP THE THIRTY HOURS WAS A GREAT. EDITION BUT REALLY EVEN AT FORTY HOURS WERE JUST GETTING CLOSE TO FIFTY PERCENT OF WHAT MANY OF OUR FACILITIES. ARE TRULY OPERATING AT IN MANY OF THESE RURAL COMMUNITIES IN SMALLER COMMUNITIES. THE PRIVATE PRACTICE MODEL OF A PRIMARY CARE IS REALLY GOING AWAY AND MANY OF THE FOLKS WHO COME IN A STEP IN THE TAKE. THAT PLACE OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS. AND. AS WE TAKE OVER THE FACILITIES ONLY WORK TOWARDS A FULL TIME LICENSE REALLY WHAT WE END UP DOING MANY TIMES IS ACTUALLY. CUTTING ACCESS THE COMMUNITY WHILE WE'RE THROUGH THAT PROCESS I RECENTLY TOOK OVER A. MEDICAL FACILITY ARE ARE HEALTH CENTER DID HOUSE IN A RURAL COMMUNITY IN THE MOUNTAINS COMMUNITY ONLY MEDICAL FACILITY IN THE COMMUNITY SERVING OVER TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE. AND IT WAS OPEN SIX DAYS A WEEK. AS SOON AS WE TOOK THAT FACILITY OVER. UNDER AS INTERMITTENT WE HAVE CUT BACK. TWO DAYS A WEEK TO THE COMMUNITY THERE AN HOUR SITTING AT THIRTY HOURS WHERE IS PREVIOUSLY OPERATING. AT CLOSER TO SIXTY AND SO UNTIL WE GET TO OUR FULLY LICENSE SO. I'M GREAT FOR THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD REALLY HELP. THE BRIDGE THAT GAP FOR US AS WE WORK THROUGH THAT TRANSITION PERIOD OF GETTING TO A. A FULL TIME STATUS IS WHAT WE CONSIDER YOU CAN HEALTH CENTERS WHICH IS REALLY UPWARDS OF THAT SEVENTY FIVE EIGHTY HOUR.

THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE COVERAGE HAS HAD A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND. AND AND OFTENTIMES IT IT WE HAVE ABOUT THE LACK OF ACCESS BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF.

THE CERTIFICATION OF SOBER LIVING RESIDENTS IS BUT ONE STEP TO STRENGTHEN THIS LINK IN THE RECOVERY CHIANG UNLESS REQUIRE VERIFIABLE ADHERENCE TO RULES MOST POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE PATIENT DURING RECOVERY. AB TWENTY TWO FOURTEEN AS A FIRST STEP TO MAKING THIS LINK STRONG. I SUPPORT THE BILL. TWENTY TWO FOURTEEN. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. I THANK YOU MY NAME IS DAVE SHERIDAN. ON THE PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE FOR RECOVERY RESIDENCES ARE IN OUR. THIS A COMPLICATED ISSUES SO I WANT TO TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO WE JUST GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT US YET. WE MAINTAIN THE MOST WIDELY REFERENCE NATIONAL STANDARD FOR RECOVERY HOUSING. IT'S IN USE IN MANY STATES. AS PART OF REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS VERY SIMILAR TO THE ONE YOU'RE CONSIDERING TODAY. INCLUDING FLORIDA'S MASSACHUSETTS OHIO PENNSYLVANIA INDIANA IN RHODE ISLAND. OR WORK IS BEEN REFERENCED BY THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. I AND ALSO IN THE SURGEON GENERAL'S REPORT ON ADDICTION IN AMERICA AND MOST RECENTLY. I IN THE REPORT FROM THE PRESIDENTIAL COMMISSION ON THE OPI CRISIS. AUG FIRST THANK YOU FOR TAKING OUT OF THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE ON. A RECOVERY HOUSING IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENTS OF COMBATING SUBSTANCE ABUSE. I MEAN ADDICTION IS A CHRONIC DISEASE IN REMISSION REQUIRES TIME. IF RECOVERING INDIVIDUALS DON'T HAVE SAFE PLACES TO LIVE TO BEGIN THAT PROCESS. THEIR OUTLOOK IS BLEAK AND RELAPSE RATES ARE HIGH. UNFORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA LAGS MANY OTHER STATES IN ITS RECOGNITION IN SUPPORT OF QUALITY RECOVERY HOUSING. AB TWENTY TWO FOURTEEN WOULD REMEDY THAT. ARE IN SHORT IT WOULD OFFER PROTECTION FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR THIS TYPE OF HOUSING. IT WOULD ADDRESS LEGITIMATE COMMUNITY CONCERNS ABOUT POORLY MANAGED AN OVERCROWDED PROPERTIES. IT PROVIDES FOR AN APPROPRIATE DEGREE OF REGULATION A NOMINAL COSTS IN CONSISTENT WITH CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS. IT ALSO ADDRESSES CALIFORNIA'S CHRONIC SHORTAGE OF WELL MANAGED RECOVERY HOUSING. IT'S A IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE MERGING BEST PRACTICE IN A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES INCLUDING THE ONES I JUST MENTIONED. HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF EXCEPTIONAL SOBER LIVING HOMES EXISTING CALIFORNIA AND HAVE FOR MANY DECADES. HOWEVER A LARGE NUMBER OF SUB STANDARD IN PREDATORY OPERATORS ALSO EXIST IN THE PUBLIC HAS NO MEANS FOR DETERMINING GOOD FROM BAD. THIS BILL WILL OFFER CONSUMERS AND THEIR FAMILIES AND MEANS FOR LOCATING WELL MANAGED AN ETHICAL RECOVERY HOUSING. IT WILL ALSO ESTABLISH AN OVERSIGHT FRAMEWORK TO PROVIDES LOCAL COMMUNITIES. RESIDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES SOME REDRESS. IN CASE THEY HAVE COMPLAINTS OR CONCERNS THAT SOMEBODY TO RETURN THEIR CALL. I JUST TO BE CLEAR THESE HOMES ARE HOUSING AND NOT TREATMENT. A LOT OF PEOPLE. WHO OPPOSE THIS SORT OF REGULATION SEEM TO CONFUSE THE SUIT WITH THE SORT PEOPLE LIVE? DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. I BELIEVE SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL BUT THEY ARE CORRECT THAT THESE HOMES ARE PROTECTED UNDER CALIFORNIAN FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS. CIVIL RIGHTS PROTECTION WAS IT WAS EXTENDED TO RECOVERING INDIVIDUALS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. BECAUSE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THEM IS REAL. AND PEOPLE DIE BECAUSE OF IT. BY THE COUNTY RIVERSIDE ENACTED IN ORDER IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO THIS BACK IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. AT THEIR COUNTY COUNCIL'S RECOMMENDATION THE LAWCLARIFIES THAT CERTIFY HOMES ARE DEEMED TO HAVE FAIR HOUSING PROTECTION. AND MUST BE TREATED THE SAME AS OTHER SINGLE FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS. THIS BILL WOULD HELP TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S SIGNIFICANT SHORTAGE OF QUALITY AFFORDABLE SOBER LIVING CAPACITY. IT WILL PERMIT GOOD PROVIDERS TO DIFFERENTIATE THEIR SERVICES. AND GIVE THEM ASSURANCES THAT THEIR FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS WILL BE RESPECTED. THAT RECOGNITION WOULD WILL ENCOURAGE MORE GOOD HOMES TO BECOME AVAILABLE. ESPECIALLY ARE HARD HIT COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY'RE MOST NEEDED. THIS IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE FOR MANY PEOPLE SOBER LIVING HOMES ARE THEIR ONLY HOPE OF STABLE RECOVERY. THIS BILL ALSO IMPORTED PROVIDES A IMPORTANT CONNECTIONS. PROTECTIONS TO COMMUNITIES AND CONSUMERS. FAMILIES WILL HAVE A SOURCE OF OF PLACES THEY CAN GO FOR EXPERT ADVICE. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS TOMLIN FREE WITH THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DAVID JONES ABOUT THE CITY NEAR ADAM STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU. READ EDWARDS PRIVATE CITIZEN LAFAYETTE CALIFORNIA STRONG SUPPORT. RICK WHEELER CEO OF RECOVERY NOW MY RECOVERY RESIDENTS STRONG SUPPORT. GREATER DAVENPORT SENIOR IN SUPPORT OF TWENTY HOUSE OVER LIVING FOR GOING ON THIRTY YEARS. JENNIFER CARVALLO CEO OF ASH'ARI OCCURS TREATMENT CENTER STRONG SUPPORT. MICHAEL PRITCHARD. STAFF ANALYST AN SCB SERVICES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN STRONG SUPPORT. CRAIG QUARRY PRIVATE CITIZEN IN RECOVERY IN STRONG SUPPORT. PETE NELSON CEO FOR THE CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS PROFESSIONALS AND SUPPORT. RE MUCH. HE WANTED OPPOSITION WOULD YOU STEP. QUESTION. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. WE CONTINUE TO BE OPPOSED TO WHAT IT SEEMS TO BE A REGULAR STREAM OF THESE EFFORTS. TO RESTRICT RESIDENTS OF CHOICES FOR. PERSONS WITH THAT WITH DISABILITIES AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW WHAT IS CENTRAL IN A CORNERSTONE TO OUR WORK AT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. IS ENSURING THAT. PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE AND RECEIVE TREATMENT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES WHETHER THAT BE PERSONS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL OR INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. WHETHER IT'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISABILITIES OR FOR EXAMPLE IN THIS CASE. DISABILITIES. DUE TO ALCOHOL OR. DRUG ADDICTION. IT'S SO WHILE MANY OF THE IN YOUR ANALYSIS I THINK DOES A VERY GOOD JOB IN LAYING OUT. THE NUMBER OF BILLS THAT REPEATEDLY COME BEFORE. THIS COMMITTEE AND OTHER COMMITTEES IN THE LEGISLATURE. TO TRAIN RESTRICT THOSE LIVING ARRANGEMENTS. RIVER LIVING RESIDENTS FOR INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITIES AND AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO NOTE THAT INDEED AND. AS I THINK THE PROPONENTS OF STATED THESE ARE HOME SWEET THESE ARE RESIDENTS AS THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT AND BECAUSE THEY ARE RESIDENTS AS. THEY ARE PROTECTED BY BOTH THE STATE AND FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING. LAW SO I I WANTED TO JUST MAKE TWO POINTS REALLY. ABOUT ITS. FAIR HOUSING LAW AND AND HOW THIS RENTS A STRAY I I THINK THE EFFORT THAT THE EFFORT IN THIS BILL IS TO PUT A LABEL ON THIS THAT IT IS A VOLUNTARY CERTIFICATION. BUT WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS VOLUNTARY CERTIFICATION ESCAPES WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FAIR HOUSING ACT IN ENSURING THAT THERE IS NOT DISCRIMINATION AGAINST PERSONS. WITH DISABILITIES AND SELECTING THE PLACES THAT. THEY CAN. LIVE ESSENTIALLY IF YOU WERE TO ADOPT SUCH A PROVISION AS THE US YOU WOULD HAVE A STATE SANCTIONED REGULATION. ON THE RESIDENCES FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS AND WHILE IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE TO LOOK AT. THE. THE INDIVIDUAL HOMES ONCE YOU OPEN THE DOOR AND LOOKED TO THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INSIDE THOSE HOMES AND IN THIS CASE. PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES THAT'S WHEN YOU STEP OVER THE LINE IS IN. IN FAIR HOUSING SO WE WOULD. SUMMIT THAT THIS. DOES NOT ONLY VIOLATE THE FAIR HOUSING ACT STATE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT BUT ALSO THE THE EIGHTY A. AND I JUST WANTED ALSO MAKE NE OTHER POINT THAT THAT THE REAL STRUCTURE OF OF THIS BILL IS IS REALLY REPLETE WITH THE CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. YOU KNOW YOU GO THROUGH THIS LIST OF OF SIXTEEN OR MORE THAT GREATLY RESTRICTS THE ABILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SEEKING TO. JUST RESIDE WITH THOSE THAT THEY WANT TO RESIDE WITH OR IF YOU HAVE SMALLER SOBER LIVING. RESIDENTS OPERATORS WHO CAN MEET EITHER THE. PROVISIONS FOR THAT THE COSTS OR THE WHOLE HOST OF REQUIREMENTS THAT YOU'RE OTHERWISE. THAT THIS BILL WOULD OTHERWISE REQUIRE TO TO MEET THAT CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS SO WE WOULD URGE. YOUR NO VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. SECURE MY CAROL WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE ALSO ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION TODAY. I'D JUST WANT TO KNOWLEDGE MEAN THE WORK AT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND ALL THE MEMBERS WHO ARE LOOKING AT THIS ISSUE WE KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN. CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED IN RECENT YEARS BECAUSE. OF AN INCREASE IN THE. AND THEN THE AMOUNT OF DRUG TREATMENT THAT'S BEING OFFERED THAT'S PARTIALLY DUE TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT REQUIREMENTS REQUIRED INSURERS TO HAVE TO. PAY FOR THAT COVERAGE WHICH IN GENERAL IS A GOOD THING. AND I THINK THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY THE OTHER FACTORS THAT WE HAVE AN OPIOID CRISIS GOING ON. SO I THINK THAT THOSE TWO ISSUES HAVE SORT OF DRIVEN IN A PUSHED A NUMBER OF MEMBERS TO TRY TO. FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION TO THIS AND UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T THINK THIS IS THE ONE. WE STAND IN CONCURRENCE WITH THE COMMENTS OF DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA I JUST WANTED ADD A COUPLE OF OTHER. NOTES TO MIKE THE COMMENTS FROM MY FRIEND MISTER GILES. FIRST OF ALL. AS HE STATES THERE ARE ANNOYING THE LIST OF REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE TO BE COMPLIED WITH IN ORDER TO BECOME CERTIFIED. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE MARKETPLACE IS THAT INCREASINGLY WELL FUNDED SOPHISTICATED PLAYERS. ARE IN ARE OUT THERE PROVIDING THESE KIND OF SERVICES. THEY HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THEY WON'T HAVE PROBLEMS ABIDING BY THE CONTENTS OF THIS OF THIS LEGISLATION. THEY HAVE THAT WHERE WITH ALL BECAUSE THEIR LARGE OPERATORS AND THEY HAVE BIG STAFFS ON. WHO'D WOULDN'T THIS BILL WILL HARM ARE THE TRUE SMALL PROVIDERS THE SINGLE FAMILY OPERATOR WHO IS REALLY PROVIDING HOUSING TO A SELECT GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS. AND NOW THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A CERTIFICATION PROCESS WHICH MIGHT BE EASY FOR A BIG PLAYER BUT NOT SO EASY FOR A SMALL PLAYER. IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE ARE TO PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL WHICH GAVE US GREAT CAUSE FOR CONCERN. ONE IS WHAT WAS MENTIONED BY THE A SUPPORTER OF THIS BILL PREVIOUSLY WHICH IS THAT THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE BILL THAT SAYS THAT IF YOU COMPLY WITH THE CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS THANK YOU. IF YOU COMPLY WITH THE CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS YOU. THEN ARE DEEMED TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH FAIR HOUSING. WELL WE WOULD ARE YOU FAT THEN PUTS A TARGET ON THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T GET CERTIFIED. AND BEGIN IT'S POTENTIALLY BECOME A SUBJECT OF HARASSMENT. OR COULD OR EFFORTS BY LOCAL CITY AND THEN LASTLY IS THE PROVISION THAT RESTRICTS THE ABILITY TO DO REFERRALS TO THESE COMPLEXES. WHICH WE THINK ADDITIONALLY WOULD HARM THOSE SMALLER GROUPS OF THE SMALLER PROVIDERS OF FINANCIALLY AND THAT'S NOT REALLY WHO WERE TRYING TO TARGET AND WHOSE CUT CREATING THE PROBLEM. AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE ASK FOR NOVA. OTHERS ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. IN KNOW AND BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISS WALDRON AND THEN MR OVERALL. THANK YOU I'M. A QUESTION I GUESS MAYBE FOR THE OPPOSITION. WHAT ARE HOW DO YOU WHAT'S THE DEFINITION OF THE SMALL? SIX CLATTER WHAT IS THAT AS OPPOSED TO THE LARGER. YEAH THE THESE ARE SIX AND UNDER HOMES THAT. OUR. AND HAVE BEEN HELD NOT SUBJECT TO ANY LOCAL ZONING A REGULATION REQUIREMENTS SO THIS IS A STEP NOW INTO THOSE SIX AND UNDER HOMES THAT HAVE THUS FAR NOT BEEN. REGULATED. MISTER CHAIRMAN. MISS WALDRON SO THAT WHAT I WAS REFERRING TO WORK THAT WE HAVE SOME PROVIDERS WHO ARE. OPERATING MULTIPLE FACILITIES RIGHT THERE THERE AND NEIGHBORHOODS YOU KNOW SO THEY THEY HAVE A FABLE THEY HAVE A LARGER INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPACITY TO MANAGE KIND OF REGULATORY ISSUES THAT THAT'S WHO I WAS REFERRED TO. THE SIZE ISN'T AS MUCH CHAVEZ SIX AND UNDER ALL THESE. I SEE THAT THE IS WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TO DO ARM I'M JUST ONE OF THOSE AWAY TO COME TOGETHER ON IT BECAUSE. AS YOU MOVE THE. THE UP THEY SUPPORTERS WERE SAYING. AND I KNOW BECAUSE OF MY WORK IN THE. WORK ON THE OPIOID CRISIS. REALLY IF THE UPPER GAME BECAUSE. SO MANY PEOPLE SLIPPING THROUGH THE CRACKS EVEN THOUGH THEY GET SO FAR. IN THE SCOTT EVERYWHERE THAT WE CAN HELP THEM AND MAKE IT WORK SO. THAT'S WHY I WAS INTERESTED IN IN THAT AND YOU KNOW I I IS THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION BETWEEN THE FAIR HOUSING AND THE CERTIFICATION YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO. YOU KNOW ASSUME THEY DON'T COMPLY WITH FOR HOUSING JUST BECAUSE OF THE CERTIFIED THAT I COULD SEE THAT DOESN'T ISSUE SO. BUT ANYWAY. YES THANK YOU MR AFRICAN JUST ADD. PLEASE ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT REGARDING THAT THE FACILITIES OF SIX AND UNDER. OFFICER WE ARE NO WORK IN THE ENDLESS INDUSTRY FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. I CAN TELL YOU TIME AND TIME AGAIN AND MANY OF THE CALLS ARE WE RESPONDED A NINE ONE ONE CALLS. THE WORKPLACE BY SMALLER FACILITIES OF LESS THAN SIX. BECAUSE THE WAY THEY'RE BEING OPERATED IN AND BUT NO REGULATION THAT NOBODY HAD ANY POLICIES TO TAKE CARE OF THE INDIVIDUALS AND. OVERSEE THE ONES WITH SIX MORE BECAUSE THEY HAVE REGULATIONS OR BETTER SUPERVISOR NORTH THEY'RE DOING. I CAN SPEAK FROM MANY TIMES LIKE I SAID IS RESPONDING TO EMERGENCY CALLS THOSE TYPES OF FACILITIES BECAUSE WE WOULD SHOW UP AND. NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON WHO'S CARING FOR THESE PERSONS AND AND THE TOP SERVICE AGAIN REALLY NOT THAT'S WHETHER CALLING US FOR JUST ONE OTHER BRING UP FOR HIS ROTH EXPERTS ITEM. OBERNOLTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER RODRIGUEZ I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL AND I WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FORWARD. I DO HAVE A CONCERN THOUGH AND IT'S JUST WITH ONE LINE OF THE BILL IT'S IN SECTION TWO. A PARAGRAPH FIVE IT SAYS. IF A RESIDENTS IS CERTIFIED PURSUANT TO THISSECTION THE ACTIVITIES AT THAT RESIDENTS SHALL BE DEEMED A RESIDENTIAL USE OF PROPERTY. AND USE A PROPERTY BY A SINGLE FAMILY. SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A KERN REQUIREMENTS STATE LAW ON. ALCOHOL AND DRUG. A TREATMENT FACILITIES BUT IT SEEMS LIKE HERE YOU'RE SEEKING TO EXPAND THAT EXEMPTION TO ALSO WERE LIVING FACILITIES. AND THAT'S SOMETHING I'M CONCERNED ABOUT AND I WANT TO ASK YOU WHY YOU'D CHOSEN TO PUT THAT SECTION IN THERE. WHAT ARE SOME OFFICER DEBRA LOOK AT WORK IN ADDRESSING AS WELL BUT WE? TOM COULD PROBABLY ASK YOU THAT MORE WHAT WE COULD DO THAT AS WELL. I'M TOM RETREAT WITH COUNTY BE HEALTH DIRECTORS THE ARM. THIS EXEMPTION TO WHAT WOULD FROM LOCAL JR ARE REGULATION WOULD APPLY TO ANY SIX BEEN UNDER HOME WHETHER IT'S THE WHETHER THEY'RE DOING TREATMENT. AND BY THE WAY SOME OF THESE HOMES DUE TO TREATMENT OF THEY HAVE TO BE LICENSED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AN ISSUE FOR THE OPPONENTS. BECAUSE THEY'RE SUBJECT ALL SORTS OF OF REQUIREMENTS THERE. BUT THEN THERE ARE OTHER SIX BED AND UNDER THE JUST DO. SOBER LIVING THEY DON'T DO TREATMENT AND THEY WOULD STILL BE EXEMPT FROM ANY IF THERE SIX BETTER UNDER THEY STILL FALL UNDER THE FAIR HOUSING EIGHTY EIGHT THEY THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY ADDITIONAL. ARE ANY ON LOCAL OB REGULATION AND THAT'S THE SITUATION NOW AND THIS BILL DOES NOT SUBJECT THEM TO ANY ADDITIONAL REGULATION BUT SOME OF THESE HOMES. THEY DO GET PUBLIC FUNDS THEY DO GET REFERRALS AND WE THINK THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. THANK YOU FOR THE ANSWER SO THAT IF STATE LAW ALREADY. APPLIES THIS TO THE FACILITIES THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT THAT I JUST I STILL WARM BAFFLED AS TO WHY WE NEED TO INCLUDED IN THE BILL. NOW TELL YOU WHY IT'S SUCH A CONCERN OF MINE IS BECAUSE WE'VE HAD SOME PROBLEMS WITH. THESE KINDS OF FACILITIES IN MY DISTRICT AND I WE HAVE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT I REPRESENT IN THE MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE HAVE MULTIPLE. RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT FACILITIES ON THE SAME STREET AND THE RESIDENCES ON THE STREETS OF REACH THE POINT A HOW MANY OF THESE FACILITIES CAN BE IN ONE PLACE. IS AFFECTING OUR PROPERTY VALUES AND YOU CAN UNDERSTAND BOTH SIDES OF THAT ISSUE RIGHT WAS SO SO WE HAVE A NEED FOR THOSE FACILITIES BUT. YOU ALSO CAN RESPECT NOT NECESSARILY BY HAVING RESIDENTS WANT MULTIPLE FACILITIES ON THEIR WITH THEIR RESIDENTIAL STREET SO THAT'S WHY MY CONSTITUENTS ARE SO CONCERNED ABOUT THIS AND. I AM FORCED WE CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL WITH THAT PROVISION IN THERE BUT. SHOULD YOU SEE REMOVE IT IN THE FUTURE I LOOK FORWARD VOTING FOR IT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEN NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE AUTHOR FOR CLOSING COMMENTS. SO MEMBERS ARE. STRUCK OUT FOR AYE VOTE THIS WEEK TO MEAN SURELY HELP RESIDENTS ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY. RESPECT GRASS RIGHT THINKING I CAN ASSURE THINK RESTORING SOME WOULD NOTE THAT. OBVIOUS YOU'VE ACCEPTED OUR AMENDMENTS AND I WOULD NOTE JUST FOR THE FOR THE OPPOSITION HERE THERE WAS A COMMENT. THAT. AND WE'VE MET RECOMMEND TO THE AUTHOR THAT. THAT HE CLARIFY THE BILL THAT. THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT PROHIBIT. REFERRALS BY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AND WE THAT'S OFFERED TO CLARIFY THAT GOING FORWARD SO OKAY. THANK YOU SO THAT BEING THE CASE. DO I HEAR A MOTION. THERE MOMENT OPTIONS MOTION.
