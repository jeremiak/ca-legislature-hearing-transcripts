ON BUDGET. TODAY WE'RE HEARING TO BILLS SB ONE TENNIS BE ONE ELEVEN WITH A BOTH A SHOW SEATED WITH THE GOVERNOR'S. WILDFIRE PLANNED THERE ALSO COMPANION BILLS. TO A. B. TEN FIFTY FOUR SO. WE HAD PARMA FINANCE HERE. COME UP [inaudible] WHAT THE? YOU'RE FREE TO START AND EVERY RIGHT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE LAKE THIS ONE OFTEN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M ALSO HERE WITH A COLLEAGUE MATTHEW HANKER WITH THE LAW FIRM O'MELVENY MYERS. A WHICH HAS BEEN ADVISING THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE RESPONSE TO A CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES. SO THE FIRST BILL BEFORE YOU IS SB ONE TEN THIS IS AN AMENDMENT TO THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN BUDGET ACT WHICH PASSED LAST MONTH. AND THIS BILL BEFORE YOU DOES TWO THINGS FIRST IT IDENTIFIES SB ONE ELEVEN AS A TRAILER BILL -- FOR THE BUDGET ACT AND THE SECOND THING THAT IT DOES IS IT APPROPRIATE SAT TWO MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES RESPONSE MEASURES. MITCHELL REMOTE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE WORDING OF THE BILL BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH WE ARE PASSING OUT. BUT THE BILL AS IT'S ACTUALLY WRITTEN IS VERY VAGUE MERELY SAYS THAT -- THIS APPROPRIATION IS FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MEASURES TO RESPOND TO THE THREAT OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES AND THAT'S ALL BUT IF YOU LOOK AT AB TEN FIFTY FOUR WHICH YOU OBVIOUSLY IS THE COMPARE THE COMPANION LEGISLATION. EIGHT TEN FIFTY FOUR IS VERY SPECIFIC ABOUT HOW THAT MONEY IS SUPPOSED TO BE SPENT BY THE DEAL OF SO WHY WAS IT NECESSARY TO BE SO VAGUE AND SB ONE TIME. SO WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION REALIZES THERE ARE NUMBER OF MOVING PIECES IN TEN FIFTY FOUR AND MORE BROADLY YOU KNOW GOING BACK TO SB NINE A ONE LAST YEAR. SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS NIMBLE AND THAT WE HAVE NO REGRETS STRATEGY WHEN IT COMES TO THE COORDINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION. OF THESE MEASURES SO AS YOU MENTIONED INTENT FIFTY FOUR THERE ARE A NUMBER OF RESPONSIBILITIES SPECIFIC TO THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE THE DEPARTMENT AND THOSE ARE EXAMINING THE BOOKS OF THE WILDFIRE FIND. IT'S MAKING SURE THAT THE WILDFIRE ALLOCATION METRICS ARE SET IN THE APPROPRIATE WAY THAT'S RESPONSIBILITY THE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS AND HE FINDS THAT FLOW INTO THE WILD FIRE FIND MAKING SURE THAT THE GENERAL FUND IS A SUFFICIENT CASH CUSHION. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE STATE IS DOING FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A REALLY SIGNIFICANT WAY IN TERMS OF THE SCALE OF WHAT. THE ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAD THAT FLEXIBILITY TO SPEND IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND OF COURSE. ANY MONEY NOT SPENT WILL REVERT TO THE GENERAL FUND AND ANY MONEY THAT IS SPENT UPON DIRECTION NOT THE DIRECTOR OF FINANCE THERE WILL BE A NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SAYING THAT ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ON THE BILL. OKAY SINGLE PUBLIC ON A WE'RE GONNA GO TO SB. ONE ELEVEN SO ON SB ONE ELEVEN AS MENTIONED THIS IS A TRAILER BILL FOR THE BUDGET -- AND AS THE VICE CHAIR WAS MENTIONING A LOT OF THE KEY POLICY CHANGES ARE ACTUALLY AND AB OR SB TEN THE ENERGY COMMITTEE. SO WITH THE REASON THAT WE REQUIRED THIS BILL IN ADDITION TO THAT IS FOR TWO REASONS NUMBER -- ONE SOME OF THE CHANGES AS PART OF THIS OVERALL STRATEGY REQUIRE REORGANIZATION AND A BUDGET TRAILER BILL AS A MORE APPROPRIATE MEASURE A VEHICLE FOR THOSE TYPES OF CHANGES THAT NAY POLICY URGENCY BILL SO WE WANTED TO BUT THOSE CHANGES. IN THIS BILL AND THEN THE SECOND REASON IS THAT THE RESOURCES FOR THAT PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THIS BILL -- WERE DISCUSSED AS PART OF THE BUDGET PROCESS AND DID GO THROUGH THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE I IN THE IN THE CONFERENCE COMMITTEE MADE A DETERMINATION TO DIFFER -- FULL ADOPTION OF ANY SUCH MEASURES INTEL THIS PROCESS WHEN WE HAD A TIME TO LOOK AT THEM IN DEPTH. SO THAT'S THE REASON IT'S IN A TRAILER BILL AND WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE MATTHEW WHO CAN SPEAK BRIEFLY ABOUT EACH OF THE ITEMS IN THE BILL. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- SB ONE ELEVEN CREATES THREE ENTITIES TO OVERSEE AND IMPLEMENT MEASURES TO MATERIALLY ADVANCE WILD FIRE SAFETY -- AND TO ADMINISTER THE WILDFIRE FUND THAT IS CREATED BY AB. TEN FIFTY FOUR THE CREATION OF THESE ENTITIES WILL PROVIDE MEANINGFUL OVERSIGHT OF THE WILDFIRE FUND ADMINISTRATOR AND WILL RESULT IN AN ENTITY EXCLUSIVELY FOCUSED ON THE SAFETY OF THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR. I ONE OF THE ENTITIES CREATE ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION IS THE CALIFORNIA CATASTROPHE RESPONSE COUNCIL. THE COUNCIL APPOINTS AN OVERSEAS THE WILDFIRE FUND ADMINISTRATOR AND IS COMPRISED OF NINE MEMBERS -- THE LEGISLATION ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. ESTABLISH THE WILD HER SAFETY DIVISION WITHIN THE COMMISSION BY JANUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY THE WELFARE SAFETY DIVISION WILL RETAIN STAFF WITH EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE AND WILD FIRE SAFETY MITIGATION CLIMATE CHANGE EMERGENCY RESPONSE. AND OTHER RELATED AREAS AND WILL OVERSEE AND FORCE ELECTRICAL CORPORATIONS COMPLIANCE WITH WELFARE SAFETY. FINALLY THE LEGISLATION ALSO CREATES THE OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY WITHIN THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. THE OFFICE WILL BE UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A DIRECTOR. AND NO LATER THAN JANUARY JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE ALL FUNCTIONS OF THE WELFARE SAFETY DIVISION ARE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO THE OFFICE OF ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SAFETY -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPTION TO ADDRESS YOU AND I'M HAPPY TO TAKING QUESTIONS. THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS MISERABLE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO. THE MAIN THING THAT RAISE MY EYEBROWS WHEN I READ THIS BILL WAS THE SOURCE OF THE APPROPRIATED FUNDING. SO THE FUNDING IS GOING TO COME FROM TWO PLACES ACCORDING THE BILL IF YOU SEE UTILITIES REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNT. AND IF YOU SEE PUBLIC ADVOCATE OFFICE ACCOUNT. YEAH IT WAS THE LATTER THAT REALLY CONCERNED ME BECAUSE THAT MONEY IS SUPPOSED TO BE DESIGNATED. FOR PREVENTING THE I'LL USE FROM UNJUSTLY RECOVERING FROM RATES EXPENSES THAT THEY SHOULDN'T BE SO WHAT'S THE ARGUMENT FOR APPROPRIATING MONEY FROM THAT ACCOUNT BECAUSE THE OTHER COUNT SEEMS A LOT MORE APPROPRIATE. SO I CAN SPEAK BEFORE THAT BUT IT SHOULD TURN OVER TO ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES A MAN FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHO CAN COME UP HERE BUT WE SAW. THE WAY WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT OVERALL FIFTY POINT ONE MILLION THERE SOME MEASURES THAT WERE IN RESPONSE TO SB NINE A ONE FROM LAST YEAR THERE'S SOME IN RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNOR STRIKE FORCE. BUT SOME SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PROTECTION OF RATE PAYERS SO REVIEWED THAT PREPARATION IS SPECIFICALLY FUNDING THOSE MEASURES BUT MY COLLEAGUES CAN SPEAK MORE TO THAT. YEAH HI NOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THAT TWO POINT FIVE MILLION FOR THE REPAIR OUR PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE IS IN RESPONSE -- TO A GOVERNOR'S BUDGET B. C. P. FOR THAT PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE OF THAT MONEY IS INTENDED TO GO BACK TO THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE. IN ORDER TO CHECK -- THE INCREASE OF WILDFIRE PROCEEDINGS THAT WILL HAPPEN IN IT FOR THE RATE PAYER ADVOCATE IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THOSE PROCEEDINGS -- I'M SORRY I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD YOU JUST SAYS SO IT IT'S COMING BACK TO THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE RIGHT THAT MONEY IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS THAT PUBLIC ADVOCATE OFFICE B. C. P. IN THE SPRING. HI AND SAID I WAS -- SORRY THAT WAS PULLED BACK WITHOUT -- PREJUDICE I THINK IN ORDER TO WAIT FOR THIS TEN FIFTY FOUR AND SB ONE ELEVEN TO COME BACK BUT THAT MONEY IS INTENDED FOR THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE IN ORDER -- TO DEAL WITH THE INCREASE IN WILDFIRE PROCEEDINGS -- THAT WILL RESULT FROM. ALL OF THIS OKAY WELL THANKS I WAS UNAWARE THAT I WILL TAKE THAT OFF LINE AND MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND IT BUT IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN CERTAINLY PUTS MY MIND AT EASE YEAH. THE QUESTIONS WERE [inaudible] COMMENTS CONCERNS [inaudible] OKAY -- YES PUBLICADO ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON SORRY ANA SB ONE TENER SB ONE A LOT. THAT'S IN PUBLIC OKAY. THEN WE WILL ADJOURN THANK YOU VERY MUCH UNDERGROUND
