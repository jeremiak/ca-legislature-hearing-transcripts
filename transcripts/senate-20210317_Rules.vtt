00:22:39.091 --> 00:22:41.793
PRIOR TO THIS MEETING IS THAT

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.862
THE BIBLE HAS BEEN MISUSED FOR

00:22:43.929 --> 00:22:46.832
GENERATIONS BUT WHAT I WAS TALK

00:22:46.898 --> 00:22:49.801
FROM FROM GENERAL FROM- GENESIS

00:22:49.868 --> 00:22:52.037
TO REVELATIONS. IS THAT THE

00:22:52.104 --> 00:22:53.972
BIBLE HAS THREE HUNDRED PLUS

00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:57.209
WORDS OF LOVE IN IT AND NOT TO

00:22:57.275 --> 00:22:59.544
JUDGE OTHER PEOPLE AND YET IT

00:22:59.611 --> 00:23:02.414
CONSISTENT BAY CONTINUOUSLY IF

00:23:02.481 --> 00:23:04.616
MISUSED AND I'M NOT GOING TO

00:23:04.683 --> 00:23:07.786
ALLOW ANYONE TO- TAKE THAT AWAY

00:23:07.853 --> 00:23:11.256
FROM ME. BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN

00:23:11.323 --> 00:23:12.858
TREATING PEOPLE WITH RESPECT

00:23:12.924 --> 00:23:15.627
AND DIGNITY AND MY LIFE HAS

00:23:15.694 --> 00:23:17.796
BEEN AN EXAMPLE OF THAT. THANK

00:23:17.863 --> 00:23:19.898
YOU I HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION

00:23:19.965 --> 00:23:23.568
AND- USER TALKED A LOT ABOUT

00:23:23.635 --> 00:23:28.006
JUDGMENT- AND FAIR TREATMENT-

00:23:28.073 --> 00:23:30.609
AND I THINK THOSE ARE REALLY

00:23:30.675 --> 00:23:32.344
IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THIS

00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:34.513
PARTICULAR COMMISSION AND THE

00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:36.681
WORK THAT YOU ARE DOING AS A

00:23:36.748 --> 00:23:38.416
COMMISSIONER YOU KNOW YOU AND I

00:23:38.483 --> 00:23:40.018
TALKED A BIT ABOUT YOUR

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:43.421
HISTORY- ABOUT HOW YOU JOINED

00:23:43.488 --> 00:23:47.259
THE FORCE- IN PASADENA. ABOUT

00:23:47.325 --> 00:23:49.594
HOW IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT-

00:23:49.661 --> 00:23:50.929
ABOUT HOW YOU WERE AN

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:53.131
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION HIRE AND

00:23:53.198 --> 00:23:54.399
WE'RE SORT OF TREATED WITH

00:23:54.466 --> 00:23:55.567
DISDAIN AND THERE WAS AN

00:23:55.634 --> 00:23:57.135
EXPECTATION THAT YOU REALLY

00:23:57.202 --> 00:23:58.570
WEREN'T QUALIFIED BUT YOU WERE

00:23:58.637 --> 00:23:59.738
THERE BECAUSE THERE WAS A QUOTA

00:23:59.805 --> 00:24:01.573
THAT NEEDED TO BE MAD ABOUT

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.443
HIRING A BLACK PERSON. AND SO-

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:06.978
AT ALSO GOT ME THINKING ABOUT

00:24:07.045 --> 00:24:08.346
THE JUVENILES WHO ARE IN THE

00:24:08.413 --> 00:24:10.982
SYSTEM WHO ARE ALSO DISREGARDED

00:24:11.049 --> 00:24:12.651
AND DISRESPECTED AND TREATED

00:24:12.717 --> 00:24:14.719
WITH DISDAIN. AND THE

00:24:14.786 --> 00:24:16.087
EXPECTATION IS THAT THEIR

00:24:16.154 --> 00:24:18.290
FAILURES AND THAT THEY'RE NOT

00:24:18.356 --> 00:24:20.358
GOING TO DO IS TO SUCCEED AND

00:24:20.425 --> 00:24:22.194
THAT MAYBE WE SHOULD BE

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.996
INVESTING RESTORATIVE EFFORTS

00:24:25.063 --> 00:24:26.798
AND FUNDING INTO THEM BECAUSE

00:24:26.865 --> 00:24:28.800
THEY'RE NOT WORTHY AND I WAS

00:24:28.867 --> 00:24:30.435
REALLY STRUCK DURING OUR

00:24:30.502 --> 00:24:31.303
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE

00:24:31.369 --> 00:24:33.839
SIMILARITIES- HOW INTRIGUING

00:24:33.905 --> 00:24:36.474
THEY ARE- BETWEEN YOUR STORY

00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:37.576
AND THAT THE TREATMENT OF THESE

00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:39.511
YOUNG FOLKS AND PROBABLY THAT

00:24:39.578 --> 00:24:41.112
PERSPECTIVE IS SOMETHING THAT'S

00:24:41.179 --> 00:24:42.814
REALLY IMPORTANT AND WHAT WE

00:24:42.881 --> 00:24:47.085
NEED TO HAVE- AS COMMISSIONERS-

00:24:47.152 --> 00:24:48.920
OVER DJ J. SO I WAS JUST

00:24:48.987 --> 00:24:50.155
WONDERING IF MAYBE. YOU KNOW IF

00:24:50.222 --> 00:24:51.523
I WAS READING TO WENT TOO MUCH

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:55.093
INTO IT OR IF NOT IF YOU COULD

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:55.927
SORT OF SPEAK TO THIS. I

00:24:55.994 --> 00:24:57.963
APPRECIATE THAT- THAT I BROUGHT

00:24:58.029 --> 00:24:59.497
MY MOTHER INTO A FOR A REASON

00:24:59.564 --> 00:25:01.333
BECAUSE AFTER MY PARENTS

00:25:01.399 --> 00:25:05.136
DIVORCED MY MOTHER RAISED TO

00:25:05.203 --> 00:25:06.071
THREE THREE DAUGHTERS ON HER

TWO JOBS AND I SHARE WITH YOU.

00:25:11.576 --> 00:25:13.211
SHE SHE WAS ABLE TO GET HER

00:25:13.278 --> 00:25:14.512
BLUFF AND EARLY WHEN SHE SAID

00:25:14.579 --> 00:25:16.314

TERMS OF MONITORING I MEAN THIS

01:08:57.233 --> 01:08:58.667
ISSUE AROUND CERTIFYING

STATE BUT WE DO CERTIFY THOSE

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:25.227
FACILITIES SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT

01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:27.062
DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIP THAT WE

01:09:27.129 --> 01:09:28.697
HAVE. WITH OUT OF STATE

01:09:28.764 --> 01:09:32.167

01:09:35.104 --> 01:09:37.439
FACILITIES THE DEPARTMENT MADE

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.308
A DECISION TO TAKE A LOOK AND

01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:41.277
DO A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF

01:09:41.343 --> 01:09:41.977
ALL OF OUR OTHER STATE

01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:43.879
FACILITIES. I'M WE DID THAT

01:09:43.946 --> 01:09:44.680
THROUGH LOOKING AT A

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:46.615

01:09:53.155 --> 01:09:55.324
ENSURE THAT FACILITIES

01:09:55.391 --> 01:09:57.393
OPERATIONS WERE IN LINE WITH

01:09:57.459 --> 01:09:58.193
WHAT THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING

01:09:58.260 --> 01:09:59.995
TO DO. DURING THAT REVIEW

01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:01.931
PROCESS WE DID MAKE A DECISION

01:10:01.997 --> 01:10:04.033
TO DECERTIFY SIXTEEN OUT OF

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:06.101
STATE FACILITIES AND SO TO DATE

01:10:06.168 --> 01:10:07.536
WE HAVE NO OUT OF STATE

01:10:07.603 --> 01:10:09.705
FACILITIES. WE BROUGHT A

01:10:09.772 --> 01:10:10.839
HUNDRED AND THIRTY TWO YEARS

REALLY GOOD. REALLY HALF

01:10:23.953 --> 01:10:26.188

DATA WHEN IT COMES TO OUR OTHER

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:34.196
STATE FACILITIES. AND SO WHAT I

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:35.230
WILL SAY IS THAT WE WERE

01:10:35.297 --> 01:10:37.466
LOOKING AT INCIDENTS THAT COME

01:10:37.533 --> 01:10:39.501
UP WE WERE LOOKING AT THEM AND-

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:41.937
COUNTY PARTNERS FOR. A FLEETING

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:43.105
AGENCIES FOR LOOKING AT THE

01:10:43.172 --> 01:10:45.374
INCIDENT HOWEVER WHAT WE DIDN'T

01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:46.642
HAVE WITH THE GOOD SYSTEM IN

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:48.210
PLACE TO LOOK AT PATTERNS OF

01:10:48.277 --> 01:10:49.545
INCIDENTS AND SO THAT IS

01:10:49.612 --> 01:10:53.515
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE BUILDING.

01:10:53.582 --> 01:10:54.984
AND PUTTING IN PLACE. ADDITION

01:10:55.050 --> 01:10:56.051
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT

01:10:56.118 --> 01:10:57.019
WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THE

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:59.488
CONTINUUM OF CARE WITH.

01:10:59.555 --> 01:11:01.757

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:05.527
OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU. SO THAT

01:11:05.594 --> 01:11:06.795
THEY DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE THE

01:11:19.141 --> 01:11:21.343
THE THINGS WE ALWAYS HAVE TO

01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:23.178
BALANCE THAT. IS THE BALANCE

01:11:23.245 --> 01:11:25.381
BETWEEN PRESERVING PLACEMENT

SOUL HE DID PASS AWAY THAT IT

01:27:14.963 --> 01:27:16.564
WAS VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND A

01:27:16.631 --> 01:27:19.033
PLACE FOR HIM- BECAUSE HE

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:22.136
NEEDED- HE HE BELIEVES HE LIVE.

01:27:22.203 --> 01:27:23.538
MORE INDEPENDENT THAN WHAT THAT

01:27:26.174 --> 01:27:28.910
ACTUALLY CASH BUT NOTHING ELSE

01:27:28.977 --> 01:27:29.944

LONGER WE WOULD HAVE RUN OUT OF

01:27:42.924 --> 01:27:44.826

01:28:05.513 --> 01:28:06.614
SITUATION BECAUSE THERE'S NO

WE'VE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT I

01:56:04.223 --> 01:56:05.958
THINK THAT. YOU KNOW SOME OF

01:56:06.025 --> 01:56:07.794
THE BARRIERS START WHEN PEOPLE

01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:09.929
WITH DISABILITIES ARE ARE VERY

01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:12.332
YOUNG AND- YOU KNOW TYPICAL

01:56:12.398 --> 01:56:15.001
QUESTION OF- YOU KNOW VERY

01:56:15.068 --> 01:56:16.202
YOUNG CHILDREN IS WHAT DO YOU

01:56:16.269 --> 01:56:17.570
WANT TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP AND

01:56:17.637 --> 01:56:19.138
SOMETIMES WE DON'T. ASK THOSE

01:56:19.205 --> 01:56:21.074
QUESTIONS. OF PEOPLE WITH

01:56:21.140 --> 01:56:22.842
DISABILITIES AND PARTICULARLY

01:56:22.909 --> 01:56:23.876
PEOPLE WITH SIGNIFICANT

01:56:23.943 --> 01:56:26.412
DISABILITIES AND- AND WE'VE

01:56:26.479 --> 01:56:28.047
SEEN SHIPS AND IN THOSE

01:56:28.114 --> 01:56:30.717
ATTITUDES WITH- WITH- THE

01:56:30.783 --> 01:56:31.951
INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES

01:56:32.018 --> 01:56:34.954
EDUCATION ACT THE ABA.

01:56:35.021 --> 01:56:37.857
INTEGRATION YOU KNOW. SOCIAL

01:56:37.924 --> 01:56:39.759
CHANGE TAKES TIME AND DECADES

01:56:39.826 --> 01:56:42.161
AND- SO I DO BELIEVE WE'VE

01:56:42.228 --> 01:56:43.696
WE'VE MADE STRIDES ALONG THE

01:56:43.763 --> 01:56:46.699
WAY BUT- BUT YES THERE THERE

01:56:46.766 --> 01:56:49.035

FOR TO BE PRODUCTIVE AND SO I'M

01:57:14.127 --> 01:57:15.561
WORKING ON ALL OF ALL OF THOSE

01:57:15.628 --> 01:57:19.165
ASPECTS OF THIS- OF THIS

01:57:19.232 --> 01:57:21.467
SITUATION. I HAVE A- I HAVE A

01:57:21.534 --> 01:57:22.902

SEVERELY AFFECTED DOWN SYNDROME

01:57:24.871 --> 01:57:27.106
A CHILD HE IS A ARE SEIZE

01:57:27.173 --> 01:57:30.843
TWENTY FOUR NOW- AS- IS TWENTY

01:57:30.910 --> 01:57:32.412
FOUR. YOU KNOW IT WHEN HE WAS

01:57:32.478 --> 01:57:33.613
SIXTEEN HE WANTED TO DRIVE SO

01:57:33.679 --> 01:57:34.447
WE TALK ABOUT DRIVING IN THE

01:57:34.514 --> 01:57:35.515
COUNTRY IT WAS A VERY EFFECTIVE

01:57:35.581 --> 01:57:37.884
BUT- HE GOT TO DRIVE AND THAT

01:57:37.950 --> 01:57:38.785
WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS VERY

01:57:38.851 --> 01:57:40.319
IMPORTANT TO HIM. HE ALSO HAD A

01:57:40.386 --> 01:57:42.255
JOB- WHERE HE WENT TO WORKING

01:57:42.321 --> 01:57:43.322
IMPACT IS LUNCH EVERY DAY ONE

01:57:43.389 --> 01:57:45.792
OF THOSE- WHAT LUNCH BECAUSE

01:57:45.858 --> 01:57:47.193
THAT MY GRANDPA USED TO KERRY

01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:49.028
RIGHT WITH THE BLACK WHEN IT

01:57:49.095 --> 01:57:51.297
WAS KIND OF. THE SHAPE LONG

01:57:51.364 --> 01:57:53.633
WAYS IN THE LEAGUE CAME AT- IS

01:57:53.699 --> 01:57:54.934
VERY PROUD OF THAT LUNCH PAIL

01:57:55.001 --> 01:57:57.069
AND IT TOOK A LOT OF PRIDE- FOR

01:57:57.136 --> 01:57:58.204
HIM TO BE ABLE TO GET UP EVERY

01:57:58.271 --> 01:58:00.072
MORNING HE SET HIS ALARM AND-

01:58:00.139 --> 01:58:02.975
HE GOT READY AND HE WAITED FOR-

01:58:03.042 --> 01:58:04.243
THE BUS TO PICK HIM UP SO THAT

01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:06.546
HE COULD GO DO THIS JOB. AND HE

01:58:06.612 --> 01:58:09.048
HAD SUCH A HIGH SENSE OF PRIDE

01:58:09.115 --> 01:58:10.783
TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS JOB AND

01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:12.151
AGAIN I DON'T ADVOCATE FOR

01:58:12.218 --> 01:58:14.220
PEOPLE TO GET PAID- LESS THAT

01:58:14.287 --> 01:58:16.456
YOU KNOW LIKE A LOW WAGER LOW

01:58:16.522 --> 01:58:18.057
LOWER WAGE THAN MINIMUM WAGE.

01:58:18.124 --> 01:58:20.960
BUT YOUR JOB DISAPPEARED WHEN

01:58:21.027 --> 01:58:22.428
THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A PIECE

01:58:22.495 --> 01:58:23.529
OF LEGISLATION CITY HAD TO BE

01:58:23.596 --> 01:58:25.932
PAID AT LEAST MINIMUM WAGE. AND

01:58:25.998 --> 01:58:27.567
BECAUSE GARRETT DURING THE DAY

01:58:27.633 --> 01:58:28.468
EVEN THOUGH HE TOOK PRIDE IN

01:58:28.534 --> 01:58:30.269
THAT POSITION HE COULD PROBABLY

01:58:30.336 --> 01:58:33.239
PRODUCE- LESS THAN 10% OF WHAT

01:58:33.306 --> 01:58:34.273
PAIN SOMEBODY OUT MINIMUM WAGE

01:58:34.340 --> 01:58:36.008
WAS. AND EVEN THOUGH HE GOT

01:58:36.075 --> 01:58:37.343
LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE IT WAS

01:58:37.410 --> 01:58:40.813
HIS MONEY THAT HE EARNED AND-

01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:42.448
AND HE TOOK PRIDE IN IT GAVE

01:58:42.515 --> 01:58:44.650
HIM A SENSE OF PURPOSE A.

01:58:44.717 --> 01:58:46.886
GEERTS HIS PERSONALITY AND

01:58:46.953 --> 01:58:48.521
EVERYTHING CHANGED. WITH HIS

01:58:48.588 --> 01:58:50.022
FAMILY AFTER HE LOST THAT JOB

01:58:50.089 --> 01:58:52.458
HE GOT DEPRESSED HE- THERE WAS

01:58:52.525 --> 01:58:53.526
A LOT OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED

01:58:53.593 --> 01:58:55.561
SO I THINK WITH THE GOOD INTENT

01:58:55.628 --> 01:58:56.963
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS ABOUT

01:58:57.029 --> 01:58:58.130
MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY GETS

01:58:58.197 --> 01:58:59.732
AT LEAST A MINIMUM WAGES IS THE

01:58:59.799 --> 01:59:01.701
INTENTION AS WELL. BUT I THINK

01:59:01.767 --> 01:59:03.202
FOR PEOPLE LIKE GARRETT AND

01:59:03.269 --> 01:59:04.504
THERE ARE MANY OF THEM PROBABLY

01:59:04.570 --> 01:59:06.138
IN THE SEVENTY PERCENTILE THAT

01:59:06.205 --> 01:59:08.941
ARE NOT WORKING I THINK THAT-

01:59:09.008 --> 01:59:09.842
AFFECTS THEM AND I THINK WE

01:59:09.909 --> 01:59:11.677
SHOULD LOOK AT. THE SERIOUSLY

01:59:11.744 --> 01:59:13.312
LOOK AT THIS IS MY OPINION I

01:59:13.379 --> 01:59:14.280
THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT

01:59:14.347 --> 01:59:16.682
SERIOUSLY ALLOWING- INDIVIDUALS

01:59:16.749 --> 01:59:20.853
WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES.

01:59:20.920 --> 01:59:21.487
INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES TO BE

01:59:21.554 --> 01:59:22.822
ABLE TO. HAVE THESE OF JOB THAT

01:59:22.889 --> 01:59:23.990
THAT. EMPLOYERS ARE WILLING TO

01:59:24.056 --> 01:59:25.358
BRING THEM ALONG AND LET THEM

01:59:25.424 --> 01:59:26.993
FEEL VALUED AND LET THEM AND

THAT THAT IT'S UNFORTUNATE- I

02:00:27.186 --> 02:00:32.191

DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES- I

02:00:53.879 --> 02:00:55.915
THINK YOU KNOW WE ARE PARTNERS

02:00:55.982 --> 02:00:57.249
WITH THE DEPARTMENT FELDMAN ALL

02:00:57.316 --> 02:00:58.918
