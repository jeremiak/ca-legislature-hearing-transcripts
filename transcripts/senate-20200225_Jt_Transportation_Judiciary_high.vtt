00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:54.400
WEALTH OF DATA COLLECTED AND

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:57.603
HOW THE INFORMATION BEING YOU

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:59.238
WE DON'T KNOW THIS. IT COLLECTS

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:00.640
WE'VE KNOWING WHAT'S BEING

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:04.510
WITHIN SO. A IT'S MY HOPE AND I

00:09:04.577 --> 00:09:06.245
BELIEVE GIVEN THE PEOPLE WHO

ARE GOING TO BE TESTIFYING

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:08.814
TODAY WE WILL BE ABLE TO

00:09:08.881 --> 00:09:11.684
EXPLORE. THE RESPONSIBLE USE OF

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:15.688
SHARED MOBILITY. DATA AND WAYS

00:09:15.755 --> 00:09:18.024
WE CAN AGAIN CONCERNS SAFEGUARD

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.492
CONSUMER PRIVACY THERE'S A

00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:21.394
BALANCING HERE BETWEEN THE

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.996
TECHNOLOGY IN ITS ADVANCES AND

00:09:24.063 --> 00:09:26.666
THE- POSSIBILITY AND THE

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:27.333
LIKELIHOOD THAT THIS

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.802
INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE USED

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:31.270
TO GET PERSONAL INFORMATION

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:33.506
ABOUT US. WHETHER IT'S BY SOME

00:09:33.572 --> 00:09:35.441
KIND OF I KEEP IT IN A FIRE

00:09:35.508 --> 00:09:37.643
VOTE VERSUS OUR NAME BUT JUST

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.111
THINK OF YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY

00:09:39.178 --> 00:09:41.514
NUMBER- BEING USED NOW TO

FOLLOW EVERYTHING YOU DO. NOW

00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:44.917
WE MAY NOT YOU KNOW YOUR NAME

00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:46.886
BUT WE DO KNOW WHAT THAT SOCIAL

00:09:46.953 --> 00:09:49.121
SECURITY NUMBER IS DOING. AND

00:09:49.188 --> 00:09:50.423
THE QUESTION IN OUR SOCIETY IS

00:09:50.489 --> 00:09:53.059
AS A DEMOCRACY IS A STATE WHERE

00:09:53.125 --> 00:09:54.460
THE RIGHT OF PRIVACY IS

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:56.162
CONSTITUTIONALLY EMBEDDED IN

00:09:56.228 --> 00:09:59.332
OUR IN. THE CONSTITUTION STATE.

00:09:59.398 --> 00:10:01.467
LAW LIBERTY PROP PRICE. THE

00:10:01.534 --> 00:10:02.802
PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA MADE IT

00:10:02.868 --> 00:10:04.971
CLEAR THE PRIVACY IS A

00:10:05.037 --> 00:10:07.039
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT COMPONENT

00:10:07.106 --> 00:10:09.342
SO. OF UP I'M HOPING WE'RE

00:10:09.408 --> 00:10:10.476
GOING TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:12.111
GROWING ACCUMULATION OF DATA

00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:14.313
NACHOS BY PRIVATE COMPANIES BUT

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:16.515
BY GOVERNMENT ENTITIES- KNOWING

00:10:16.582 --> 00:10:17.583
THAT THE MORE DATA THAT'S

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.719
COLLECTED AND DISSEMINATED CAN

00:10:19.785 --> 00:10:21.187
AGAIN IDENTIFY PARTICULAR

00:10:21.253 --> 00:10:23.189
CALIFORNIANS. MAKING OUR

00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:25.725
PRIVACY RIGHTS MORE VULNERABLE

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:29.662
SO- THE GOAL I HOPE IS AS WE

00:10:29.729 --> 00:10:30.863
HAVE THIS DISCUSSION WE CAN

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.631
ENSURE THAT ANY DATA SHARING

00:10:32.698 --> 00:10:34.667
LAWS AND REGULATIONS. ENSURE

00:10:34.734 --> 00:10:36.369
DATA IS AVAILABLE BUT THAT IT

00:10:36.435 --> 00:10:38.904
DOES NOT PLACE PERSONAL

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:41.874
INFORMATION AT RISK THAT TO ME

00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:43.309
IS THE FIRE WALL. WE CAN

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:46.012
COLLECTED WE CAN FIGURE OUT

00:10:46.078 --> 00:10:47.847
BETTER ROAD PATTERNS WE CAN

00:10:47.913 --> 00:10:49.548

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:34.193
CONSORTIUM OF EIGHT

00:16:34.259 --> 00:16:37.296
UNIVERSITIES WE ARE FUNDED THE

00:16:37.363 --> 00:16:39.998
US DEPARTMENT INTERPRETATION

00:16:40.065 --> 00:16:40.999
FIVE. CITY IN CALIFORNIA M. THE

00:16:41.066 --> 00:16:44.203
I. BEING ON BEHALF OF THE FIVE

00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:48.841
UNIVERSITIES TODAY. I HAVE TO

00:16:48.907 --> 00:16:51.143
ACKER EMAIL HEY IS A- PH DIS IN

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.444
THE YEAR AT THE OF SOUTHERN

CALIFORNIA- HE IS THE ONE WHO

00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:57.082
ACTUALLY MOTIVATED US TO BE

00:16:57.149 --> 00:17:02.221
HERE TODAY- AND- HE DID 90% OF

00:17:02.287 --> 00:17:02.855
ALL THE WORK I'M GOING TO SHOW.

00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:05.891
SO I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR IS THAT

00:17:05.958 --> 00:17:08.260
TO. THE SITTING OVER THERE IN

00:17:08.327 --> 00:17:10.896
THIS PRESENTATION. DID YOU WANT

00:17:10.963 --> 00:17:14.466
ANYTHING MORE- MISTER BELL.

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:16.502
OKAY THANK YOU- I UNDERSTAND I

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:19.204
HAVE EXACTLY FIVE MINUTES I

00:17:19.271 --> 00:17:19.772
THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE ON THE

00:17:19.838 --> 00:17:25.978
SCREEN. WHAT DO I DO. TRY THAT

00:17:26.044 --> 00:17:28.781
ARE PERFECT THANK YOU I AM NOT

00:17:28.847 --> 00:17:33.085
TECHNOLOGICALLY BRILLIANT OKAY-

00:17:33.152 --> 00:17:35.621
I HAVE ONLY FIVE MINUTES AND SO

00:17:35.687 --> 00:17:38.924
I'M GOING TO MAKE FOUR POINTS

00:17:38.991 --> 00:17:39.658
THE FOUR POINTS I'M GOING TO

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:43.028
MAKE- IS NUMBER ONE THAT

00:17:43.095 --> 00:17:44.563
ACADEMIC RESEARCH IS IN THE

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.098
PUBLIC INTEREST IN THIS

00:17:46.165 --> 00:17:48.167
PARTICULAR FIELD-

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:50.569
TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH DEPENDS

00:17:50.636 --> 00:17:53.806
ON DECEMBER GET DATA. DATA COLD

00:17:53.872 --> 00:17:55.641
JUNE IS NOT THE SAME AS DATA

00:17:55.707 --> 00:17:58.110
SHARING AND PRIVACY CONSTRUED

00:17:58.177 --> 00:18:00.846
CONCERNS CAN BE ADDRESSED- IN

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:04.183
THE RESEARCH WORLD- I WANT TO

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:06.985
THANK EVERYONE ALSO FOR. GIVING

00:18:07.052 --> 00:18:08.787
US THE OPPORTUNITY AT THE

00:18:08.854 --> 00:18:11.056
UNIVERSITY TO ACTUALLY SPEAK AT

00:18:11.123 --> 00:18:13.659
THIS HEARING- I DON'T KNOW THAT

00:18:13.725 --> 00:18:15.127
THE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH VOICES

00:18:15.194 --> 00:18:19.598
ALWAYS HURTS THIS IS A MUCH

00:18:19.665 --> 00:18:22.401
APPRECIATED BY US- THIS FIRST

00:18:22.468 --> 00:18:24.903
POINT IS THAT. MAKE RESEARCH IS

00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:27.973
IN THE PUBLIC. AND WHAT IS

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.976
WORSE IS THAT. REESE IS WHAT

00:18:31.043 --> 00:18:31.810
GIVES US BETTER ON OF HOW

00:18:31.877 --> 00:18:34.413
THINGS WORK RIGHT- AND HOW

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.081
PEOPLE BEHAVE IT HELPS TO

00:18:36.148 --> 00:18:38.383
INFORMED IT HELPS TO INFORM

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:40.919
PUBLICPOLICY- AND IT'S CREATES

00:18:40.986 --> 00:18:43.489
A NEW TOOLS IT'S THE RESEARCH

00:18:43.555 --> 00:18:47.860
THAT IS ACTUALLY CREATED ALL

00:18:47.926 --> 00:18:50.596
NEW MODES OF TRANSPORTATION

00:18:50.662 --> 00:18:54.533
THAT WERE. OF AND- THAT'S WHAT

00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:56.935
MAKES IT- SO IMPORTANT I THINK

00:18:57.002 --> 00:18:59.204
TO THE PUBLIC COMMUNITY- AND

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:00.606
THIS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE

00:19:00.672 --> 00:19:03.475
STANDARDS OF RESEARCHERS SO

00:19:03.542 --> 00:19:05.377
HIGH- SO WHEN WE DO RESEARCH IN

00:19:05.444 --> 00:19:07.679
THE ACADEMY WE ARE LOOKING. AT

00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:10.015
CAN. CAN THESE FINDINGS BE

00:19:10.082 --> 00:19:13.452
REALIZABLE- WE ARE LOOKING FOR

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:16.221
COMPREHENSIVENESS AND RECUR- WE

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:18.557
ARE LOOKING FOR IN AN INSTANT

00:19:18.624 --> 00:19:21.059
OBJECTIVITY. AN WE ARE LOOKING

00:19:21.126 --> 00:19:22.461
FOR QUALITY THAT MEETS A PEER

00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:26.431
REVIEW US CRITERIA- IN SO

00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:29.001
REALLY WHAT WE ARE INTO HERE IS

00:19:29.067 --> 00:19:30.602
ACADEMIC RESEARCH THAT CREATES

00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:34.406
A PROCESS- THAT IS SURE IS

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:41.480
QUALITY OF RESEARCH. OKAY NEXT

00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:44.550
ON THIS POINT- IS- TO MOVE A

00:19:44.616 --> 00:19:45.317
LITTLE BIT INTO THE

00:19:45.384 --> 00:19:47.119
TRANSPORTATION SPHERE MORE DO

00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:49.688
MORE SPECIFICALLY AND THE

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:53.158
QUESTION OF BY VERY SKEPTICISM-

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:56.595
TRAVEL BEHAVIOR RESEARCH- WE

00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:58.497
ARE IT WE'RE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE

00:19:58.564 --> 00:20:00.766
SOME VERY AMBITIOUS GHG

00:20:00.832 --> 00:20:01.700
REDUCTION TARGETS. OF THE

00:20:01.767 --> 00:20:03.669
TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS

00:20:03.735 --> 00:20:05.537
ACTUALLY AN INCREASING SHARE OF

00:20:05.604 --> 00:20:07.072
ALL OF OUR G. G. EMISSIONS

00:20:07.139 --> 00:20:09.708
BECAUSE OTHER SECTORS ARE DO

00:20:09.775 --> 00:20:12.744
BETTER AND- WE DON'T SEE HOW

00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:15.013
WE'RE GOING SHE THOSE TARGETS

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.482
WITHOUT JUSTIN WILL BEHAVE. SO

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:20.218
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US. BE ABLE

00:20:20.285 --> 00:20:21.887
TO UNDERSTAND RISE STRAP TO A

00:20:21.954 --> 00:20:26.558
DECISION. FINALLY HAVE A THIS

00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:28.293
IS JUST SOME EXAMPLES OF THE

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.797
KINDS OF QUESTIONS- THAT COME

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:35.300
UP TO YOU- AND THAT HAVE THEIR-

00:20:35.367 --> 00:20:37.903
GROUNDING EVEN RESEARCH THAT

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.572
NEEDS TO BE DONE AND JUST TO

00:20:40.639 --> 00:20:42.307
PICK OUT ONE OF THESE- HOW

00:20:42.374 --> 00:20:47.145
SHOULD HER. SB PRIORITIZE THAT

00:20:47.212 --> 00:20:49.848
A QUESTION OF DEMAND RIGHT

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:51.383
THERE'S A DEMAND OUT THERE FOR

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:53.051
SCOOTERS THERE'S A DEMAND OUT

00:20:53.118 --> 00:20:54.620
THERE FOR TEA AND SEES THERE'S

00:20:54.686 --> 00:20:56.355
THE BAND OUT THERE FOR LOCAL

00:20:56.421 --> 00:20:57.823
DELIVERY TRUCKS. AND

00:20:57.889 --> 00:20:59.891
EVERYBODY'S COMPETING FOR YOUR

00:20:59.958 --> 00:21:01.994
SPACE SO HOW DO YOU DECIDE IT

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.729
WILL YOU NEED. THIRTY NEED SOME

00:21:03.795 --> 00:21:07.199
STANDING ALL THE MAN PATTERNS A

00:21:07.265 --> 00:21:09.868
TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS THE

00:21:09.935 --> 00:21:12.204
SECOND POINT IS THAT. RESEARCH

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.774
DEPENDS ON DISAGGREGATED DATA-

00:21:15.841 --> 00:21:18.276
THIS AGGREGATE DATA MEANS DATA-

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:20.979
USUALLY OF INDIVIDUALS AND WE

00:21:21.046 --> 00:21:22.447
ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY LONG

00:21:22.514 --> 00:21:24.750
HISTORY OF. TRAVEL BEHAVIOR

00:21:24.816 --> 00:21:28.220
RESEARCH BASED ON INDIVIDUALS-

00:21:28.286 --> 00:21:29.721
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

00:21:29.788 --> 00:21:32.457
ACTUALLY COLLECTED CALL TRAVEL

00:21:32.524 --> 00:21:36.228
DIARY INFORMATION SINCE THE

00:21:36.294 --> 00:21:36.928
NINETEEN SIXTIES. AND THOSE

00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:39.798
TYPES OF SURVEYS- ABS. VALUABLE

00:21:39.865 --> 00:21:41.133
TO US IN BEING ABLE TO

00:21:41.199 --> 00:21:45.070
UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE- TRAVEL

00:21:45.137 --> 00:21:48.006
AND WHAT THEIR MOTIVATIONS ARE-

00:21:48.073 --> 00:21:51.309
IF WE HAVE INDIVIDUAL DATA CAN

00:21:51.376 --> 00:21:53.879
ALWAYS AGGREGATED RIGHT SEC. WE

00:21:53.945 --> 00:21:55.380
ALWAYS SCALE IT UP WE COULD

00:21:55.447 --> 00:21:59.051
ALWAYS COME UP TO LEVELS WHERE

00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:00.786
WE'RE BEYOND THAT INDIVIDUALS

00:22:00.852 --> 00:22:04.156
INTO GROUPS OR POPULATIONS-

00:22:04.222 --> 00:22:06.058
INDIVIDUAL OF BE A DATA

00:22:06.124 --> 00:22:08.460
ACTUALLY ALLOWS FOR THE BROAD

00:22:08.527 --> 00:22:11.163
THIS TYPE OF RESEARCH- SO IF WE

00:22:11.229 --> 00:22:13.498
REALLY WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW

00:22:13.565 --> 00:22:14.933
WOMEN WITH CHILDREN UNDER THE

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.005
AGE. TO HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR

00:22:20.072 --> 00:22:21.139
DRIVING AS OPPOSED TO TEAM

00:22:21.206 --> 00:22:22.407
PUBLIC TRANSPORT WE CAN

00:22:22.474 --> 00:22:24.810
ACTUALLY ZERO WITH THE PRINT.

00:22:24.876 --> 00:22:25.844
PATIENTS OF THAT PARTICULAR

00:22:25.911 --> 00:22:33.285
pEVER IS UP WHEN WE ARE MEANING

00:22:33.351 --> 00:22:37.656
DATA WE NEVER KNOW BUT WE FIND

00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:42.294
AND THOSE DISCOVERIES ARE ALL

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:48.834
ARE YOU FOR. THIS IS. SLIGHTLY

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.268
GIVES YOU JUST SOME QUICK POLLS

00:22:50.335 --> 00:22:51.870
OF THE TYPE OF RE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; THAT OF&lt;/c&gt;</u>

00:22:51.937 --> 00:22:53.638
YOU ARE DEALING WITH IN THAT IS

00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:54.606
A REAL RELY ON THIS TYPE OF

00:22:54.673 --> 00:22:56.575
DATA SO THE FOR QUESTION ON

00:22:56.641 --> 00:22:59.211
THIS HERE IS DO DOCK WITH

00:22:59.277 --> 00:23:00.846
MOBILE IN RIGHT FIELD SERVICE

00:23:00.912 --> 00:23:04.850
COMPLIMENTS. FOR OR TO- TRAVEL

00:23:04.916 --> 00:23:07.352
MODES WELL THE WAIT IS THAT IS

00:23:07.419 --> 00:23:09.921
ACTUALLY TO LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL

00:23:09.988 --> 00:23:12.657
TRAVEL BEHAVIOR. I IT'S NOT

00:23:12.724 --> 00:23:13.992
THAT THESE QUESTIONS COULD NOT

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:16.828
NECESSARILY BE ADDRESSED BUT WE

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:17.629
CAN ADDRESS THEM A WHOLE LOT

00:23:17.696 --> 00:23:19.865
BETTER- IF WE HAVE THE DETAILED

00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:24.069
DATA. JUST TO GIVE YOU A COUPLE

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:25.771
OF HIS EXAMPLES OF THE KINDS OF

00:23:25.837 --> 00:23:27.305
THINGS THAT WE HAVE FOUND WAS

00:23:27.372 --> 00:23:29.074
INDIVIDUAL I'VE STATED YOU HAVE

00:23:29.141 --> 00:23:31.877
SOME EXAMPLES ON THAT SLIDE-

00:23:31.943 --> 00:23:32.878
THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

00:23:32.944 --> 00:23:34.613
DISCUSSION FOR EXAMPLE OF

00:23:34.679 --> 00:23:37.015
GENTRIFICATION AND TRANSIT RICH

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:39.017
NEIGHBORHOODS. AT AND THEN WHAT

00:23:39.084 --> 00:23:40.352
HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE MOVE AROUND

00:23:40.418 --> 00:23:43.321
THESE NEIGHBORHOODS THE END UP

00:23:43.388 --> 00:23:44.756
WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE HIGHER

00:23:44.823 --> 00:23:46.725
INCOMES THAT ARE LESS LIKELY

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:49.461
THE TRANSIT IN THERE FOR WE GET

00:23:49.528 --> 00:23:54.132
REAL BENEFIT THAT PUBLIC. LAST

00:23:54.199 --> 00:23:59.437
MONTH WELL LOOKING AT. TWO

00:23:59.504 --> 00:24:02.140
HUNDRED UNDER IN. THAT MOST OF

00:24:02.207 --> 00:24:03.875
THE TIME WE GET WITH REESE IS

00:24:03.942 --> 00:24:08.013
IN VIEW MILES TRAVELED. POINT

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:09.181
THREE PM DATA CALL IS NOT THIS

00:24:09.247 --> 00:24:11.449
THING IS DATA WE HAVE ALL OF

00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:14.452
BIG IN RESEARCH OF HIGHLY

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:18.557
CONFIDENTIAL DATA- THAT IS USED

00:24:18.623 --> 00:24:20.625
FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESEARCH SO

00:24:20.692 --> 00:24:23.762
IT'S COLLECTED AND IT IS STORED.

00:24:23.829 --> 00:24:27.265
IT IS NOT THE STANDARDS FOR HOW

00:24:27.332 --> 00:24:30.402
IT IS ACCESSED ARE VERY STRICT

00:24:30.468 --> 00:24:32.571
SO IT'S VERY POSSIBLE TO HAVE

00:24:32.637 --> 00:24:38.844
EXTREMELY SENSITIVE DATA- CUT

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:40.612
THE CENTRAL DATA WAREHOUSE THAT

00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:42.514
IS ESSENTIALLY UNDER LOCK AND

00:24:42.581 --> 00:24:45.917
KEY- KEEP IT OUT OF THE CLOUD

00:24:45.984 --> 00:24:49.788
KEEP IT OUT OF. HE SORT OF NEXT

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:52.290
TURNER. AN THOSE ARE DAYS THAT

00:24:52.357 --> 00:24:53.158
WE HAVE OF BEING ABLE TO

00:24:53.225 --> 00:24:55.927
PROTECT THIS DATA- AND THEN

00:24:55.994 --> 00:24:58.129
ONCE YOU HAVE THAT THEN YOU CAN

00:24:58.196 --> 00:25:00.432
MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT WHO HAS

00:25:00.498 --> 00:25:03.068
ACCESS FOR WHAT PURPOSE- A GOOD

00:25:03.134 --> 00:25:05.804
EXAMPLE OR THE US CENSUS DATA

00:25:05.871 --> 00:25:07.205
CENTERS THAT ARE ALL OVER THE

00:25:07.272 --> 00:25:10.008
UNITED STATES THERE ONE AT UCLA

00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:12.510
THERE'S ONE AT UC BERKELEY FOR

00:25:12.577 --> 00:25:16.014
EXAMPLE. AND THAT GIVES. ACCESS

00:25:16.081 --> 00:25:17.515
TO COME TO PRIVATE INFORMATION

00:25:17.582 --> 00:25:19.384
THAT THE GOVERNMENT COLLECTS ON

00:25:19.451 --> 00:25:22.287
INDIVIDUALS- YOU ONLY GET

00:25:22.354 --> 00:25:24.256
ACCESS TO IT BY VIRTUE OF AN

00:25:24.322 --> 00:25:26.424
APPLICATION.  REVIEW OF THAT

00:25:26.491 --> 00:25:28.260
APPLICATION AND ACCEPTANCE OF

00:25:28.326 --> 00:25:30.695
THAT APPLICATION THEN WHEN YOU

00:25:30.762 --> 00:25:32.097
HAVE ACCESS TO THAT DATA YOU

00:25:32.163 --> 00:25:34.232
CAN USE THE DATA BUT YOU CAN

00:25:34.299 --> 00:25:35.400
TAKE IT ANYWHERE. YOU HAVE TO

00:25:35.467 --> 00:25:37.102
USE IT IN A BOX FACILITY YOU

00:34:01.973 --> 00:34:03.908
THAT WE FACE DOES THAT WE HAD

00:34:03.975 --> 00:34:05.243
ZERO INFORMATION ABOUT HOW

00:34:05.309 --> 00:34:06.611

AND METHODS TO HELP AGENCIES.

00:34:14.852 --> 00:34:15.586
AS THE INFORMATION THEY WOULD

00:34:15.653 --> 00:34:18.456
NEED DRIVE PROGRESS ON KEY

00:34:18.523 --> 00:34:20.758
PUBLIC. STATE ABILITY. WILL ACT.

00:34:20.825 --> 00:34:24.095
TO TRANSPORTATION. SIMILAR TO

00:34:24.162 --> 00:34:25.096
OUR FIRST PRESENTER HERE I

00:34:25.163 --> 00:34:27.265
COLLECTED TRAVEL SURVEY DATA IS

00:34:27.331 --> 00:34:28.366
THAT ACTUALLY LED TO SOME OF

00:34:28.433 --> 00:34:29.867
THE FIRST STUDIES THAT

00:34:29.934 --> 00:34:31.102
INDICATED THE IMPACTS OF UBER

00:34:31.169 --> 00:34:32.603
AND LEFT ON OUR TRANSPORTATION.

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:34.272
DUMPSTER SOME OF THE MOST CITED

00:34:34.338 --> 00:34:36.974
TODAY. TODAY ALL DESCRIBE THE

00:34:37.041 --> 00:34:38.676
NATURE AND ROLE OF THIRD PARTY

00:34:38.743 --> 00:34:41.345
SOLUTIONS. FORMER EMIGRATE SIR

00:34:41.412 --> 00:34:43.014
OR AS A GREAT DEAL OF TIME.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.549
ABOUT THE HOUSING OF DIFFERENT

00:34:44.615 --> 00:34:46.617
GOVERNOR BOTTLES FOR THE DATA

00:34:46.684 --> 00:34:49.353
SHARING OVER THE PAST EIGHT

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.556
YEARS. TODAY THERE ARE THREE

00:34:51.622 --> 00:34:53.257
COMMON. THE DATA SURE. THE

00:34:53.324 --> 00:34:54.625
FIRST IS BEING PRE AGGREGATED

00:34:54.692 --> 00:34:55.993
DATA FROM OPERATORS. THE KEY

00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.528
CRITICISM OF THIS APPROACH IS

00:34:57.595 --> 00:34:59.263
THAT SOME AGENCIS DO NOT FEEL

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:00.865
THAT OPERATORS CAN TRUTHFULLY

00:35:00.932 --> 00:35:03.201
SELF REPORT ON THEIR SERVICES

00:35:03.267 --> 00:35:05.136
WHICH IS FAIR. THE SECOND IS

00:35:05.203 --> 00:35:07.004
THAT YOU SING IT PARTS OF THIRD

00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:07.505
PARTY SOLUTIONS SUCH AS

00:35:07.572 --> 00:35:10.208
POPULOUS OF AGENCIES ARE ABLE

00:35:10.274 --> 00:35:12.577
TO THEN RECEIVE- ROD DISAGREED

00:35:12.643 --> 00:35:13.878
DATA FROM. OPERATORS TO THE

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:16.380
AUDITING SERVICES AND CAN THEN

00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:17.915
JUST LEAVE TH INFORMATION THEY

00:35:17.982 --> 00:35:20.051
NEED AND WANT IN FORM OF CHARTS

00:35:20.117 --> 00:35:23.087
REPORTS VISUALISATIONS AND

00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:25.656
OTHER DATA IT'S BETTER. THAT

00:35:25.723 --> 00:35:26.357
ALLOW THEM TO MAKE THE KEEP.

00:35:26.424 --> 00:35:28.326
AND PLANNING TO. THEY NEED TO

00:35:28.392 --> 00:35:29.660
MAKE AS THERE ARE STORIES OF

00:35:29.727 --> 00:35:31.062
THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY. AND

00:35:31.128 --> 00:35:32.430
THE THIRD MODEL IS FOR CITIES

00:35:32.497 --> 00:35:34.298
TO DIRECTLY RECEIVE ROD

00:35:34.365 --> 00:35:36.200
DISAGGREGATED DATA FROM ABILITY

00:35:36.267 --> 00:35:38.069
OPERATORS I FIRST POPULOUS IN

00:35:38.135 --> 00:35:39.570
LARGE PART BECAUSE THERE ARE A

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:40.738
NUMBER OF KEY CHALLENGES THAT I

00:35:40.805 --> 00:35:42.373
WITNESSED PUBLIC AGENCY OR

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.175
STRUGGLE WITH. WHEN DATA IS

00:35:44.242 --> 00:35:45.109
DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO PUBLIC

00:35:45.176 --> 00:35:47.778
AGENCIES SPECIFICALLY HOLDING

00:35:47.845 --> 00:35:49.080
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL SENSITIVE

00:35:49.146 --> 00:35:50.781
INFORMATION CAN BE DIFFICULT

00:35:50.848 --> 00:35:52.583
FOR SOME AGENCIES THAT MAY LACK

00:35:52.650 --> 00:35:54.352
THE DATA MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS

00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:56.320
THAT SHOULD BE IN PLACE TO

00:35:56.387 --> 00:35:58.589
PROTECT THAT DATA. LIMIT ACCESS

00:35:58.656 --> 00:36:01.192
TO IT. I'M CURRENTLY WE FOUND

00:36:01.259 --> 00:36:02.793
THAT NOT OLD. THE FOR RESOURCES

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:04.428
TO BUILD INTERNAL SOLUTIONS TO

00:36:04.495 --> 00:36:06.564
TURN WHAT IS A VERY LARGE VERY

00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:08.332
MESSY DATA INTO THE USEFUL

00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:09.734
INFORMATION THAT TRANSPORTATION

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.569
PLANNERS NEED. AND WANT FOR

00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:13.504
POLICY AND PLANNING. OF THIS

00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:14.705
KIND OF POLICY ARE SEVERAL

00:36:14.772 --> 00:36:15.907
THIRD PARTY DATA GOVERNANCE

00:36:15.973 --> 00:36:17.375
MODELS THAT FOLKS HAVE

00:36:17.441 --> 00:36:18.976
CONTEMPLATED OVER THE LAST

00:36:19.043 --> 00:36:20.878
DECADE I PURPOSELY. POPULOUS IS

00:36:20.945 --> 00:36:22.146
A PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANY

00:36:22.213 --> 00:36:23.881
DESPITE MY BACKGROUND IN THE

00:36:23.948 --> 00:36:26.150
NONPROFIT ACADEMIC AND PUBLIC

00:36:26.217 --> 00:36:27.084
SECTOR INSTITUTIONS. BECAUSE

00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:28.920
THEIR NUMBER OF KEY CONSTRAINTS

00:36:28.986 --> 00:36:30.655
THAT UNDER THESE INSTITUTIONS

00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:31.956
FROM EFFECTIVELY SOLVING THE

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:33.691
MOBILITY DATA GAP. FIRST

00:36:33.758 --> 00:36:35.359
SECURELY STORING CLEANING A

00:36:35.426 --> 00:36:37.128
PROCESSING LARGE AMOUNTS OF GEO

00:36:37.194 --> 00:36:37.962
LOCATION DATA REQUIRES

00:36:38.029 --> 00:36:39.730
SIGNIFICANT ENGINEERING SOURCES

00:36:39.797 --> 00:36:41.365
AND VERY FEW NONPROFIT AN

00:36:41.432 --> 00:36:43.935
ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS POSSESS

00:36:44.001 --> 00:36:45.937
THEM. THAT BEING SAID IT IS

00:36:46.003 --> 00:36:46.971
CRUCIAL THAT INDEPENDENT

00:36:47.038 --> 00:36:49.206
RESEARCHERS AND EXHORTATION

00:36:49.273 --> 00:36:51.642
CONSULTANTS HAVE ACCESS TO

MOBILITY DATE. ANSWER THE MANY

00:36:56.414 --> 00:36:58.683
CAR AND- OF THESE MOBILE

00:36:58.749 --> 00:37:00.785
SERVICE. LET'S HAS A NUMEROUS

00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:01.752
THE FROM ACTS TO MY DAY FOR NOT

ADVOCACY. TRANSPORTATION FOR

00:37:03.154 --> 00:37:04.555
AND PERFECT PROFESSORS PER THE

00:37:04.622 --> 00:37:06.357
REQUEST OF OUR CITY CUSTOMERS

00:37:06.424 --> 00:37:07.558
AND WITH THE PERMISSION OF

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:09.760
MOBILITY OPERATORS LET ME

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:11.629
ILLUSTRATE A FEW DIFFERENT USE

00:37:11.696 --> 00:37:12.797
CASES AND THE REQUIRED LEVEL OF

00:37:12.863 --> 00:37:15.099
DATA GRANULARITY AND REQUIRED

00:37:15.166 --> 00:37:19.203
AND SEE- FOR THOSE SPECIFIC USE

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:20.037
CASES TO BE FEASIBLE. AND MY

00:37:20.104 --> 00:37:21.606
WORK LET WE FIND THAT THE

00:37:21.672 --> 00:37:22.540
MAJORITY OF CITIES WERE BILLY

00:37:22.607 --> 00:37:24.408
OPERATORS TO ABIDE BY POLICIES

00:37:24.475 --> 00:37:25.476
THAT PRIMARILY IMPACT

00:37:25.543 --> 00:37:26.811
STATIONARY VEHICLES PARKED

00:37:26.877 --> 00:37:28.679
VEHICLES SUCH AS PREFERRED-

00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:30.815
RESTRICTED PARKING AREAS CAPS

00:37:30.881 --> 00:37:32.250
LIMITING THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES

00:37:32.316 --> 00:37:33.484
ON A CENTRAL IN A CENTRAL

BUSINESS DISTRICT OR PLACING A

00:37:36.954 --> 00:37:38.222
MINIMUM NUMBER OF YOU. THE

00:37:38.289 --> 00:37:39.323
EQUITIES OWNS REAL TIME AND FOR

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:42.927
ME. VEHICLES FOR DATA

00:37:42.994 --> 00:37:44.095
VALIDATION SAYS IS SOMETHING WE

00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:45.329
WERE. HOW PACKED SPEAKING WE DO

00:37:45.396 --> 00:37:46.964
FIND THAT MOST CITIES AND FORCE

00:37:47.031 --> 00:37:48.633
THESE POLICIES ON MORE OF A

00:37:48.699 --> 00:37:50.735
MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY BASIS- THE

00:37:50.801 --> 00:37:52.203
MOBILITY DATA SPECIFICATION

00:37:52.269 --> 00:37:53.738
HASN'T BEEN PARTICULARLY WELL

00:37:53.804 --> 00:37:55.072
SUITED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS

00:37:55.139 --> 00:37:56.774
ABOUT STATIONARY VEHICLES. AS

00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:58.376
HAS BEEN RECENTLY DESCRIBED IN

00:37:58.442 --> 00:37:59.276
SOME CITY REPORTS THAT HAVE

00:37:59.343 --> 00:38:01.612
UTILIZED THESE- DATA FEEDS AND

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:03.514
A COUPLE OF OTHER JURISDICTIONS

00:38:03.581 --> 00:38:05.349
AROUND THE UNITED STATES. SOME

00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:06.817
CITIES ENVISION A FUTURE WHERE.

00:38:06.884 --> 00:38:09.086
DATA COULD BE USED IN REAL TIME

00:38:09.153 --> 00:38:10.621
TO MORE ACTIVELY MANAGE

00:38:10.688 --> 00:38:13.491
TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM FOR

00:38:13.557 --> 00:38:14.659
EXAMPLE THE REAL TIME ROUTING

00:38:14.725 --> 00:38:18.229
OR READ TIME THING OF. HOWEVER

00:38:18.295 --> 00:38:20.297
CAN. THAT THE BORDER CALL UPON

00:38:20.364 --> 00:38:21.198
AGENT HAS ON THE TRACK. SYSTEM

00:38:21.265 --> 00:38:23.000
THE MORE RISK IN LIABILITY THEY

00:38:23.067 --> 00:38:24.268
ALSO HAVE TO BE WILLING TO

00:38:24.335 --> 00:38:25.803
ASSUME. ONE EXAMPLE IN THE

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.405
CONTEXT OF STUDENTS SCOOTERS

00:38:27.471 --> 00:38:28.706
THAT WE SEE TODAY IS THAT THERE

00:38:28.773 --> 00:38:31.976
ARE NUMBER OF CITIES THAT

00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:32.610
ADOPTED LOW SPEED ZONES FIRST.

00:38:32.677 --> 00:38:34.578
BY RICK OPERATORS AUTOMATICALLY

00:38:34.645 --> 00:38:36.414
READ SPEED OF THEIR VEHICLES

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.215
WITHIN A SPECIFIED GEO FENCE.

00:38:38.282 --> 00:38:39.750
WITHOUT PROPER NOTICE TO

00:38:39.817 --> 00:38:41.519
WRITERS HOWEVER THIS CAN

00:38:41.585 --> 00:38:42.887
POTENTIALLY COMPOUND SAFETY

00:38:42.953 --> 00:38:44.555
ISSUES FOR EXAMPLE A WOMAN IN

00:38:44.622 --> 00:38:46.791
SANTA MONICA BADLY INJURED WHEN

00:38:46.857 --> 00:38:47.958
HER HUSBAND SCOOTER SUDDENLY

00:38:48.025 --> 00:38:50.428
ACCELERATED. UPON LEAVING ALONE

00:38:50.494 --> 00:38:51.796
IT'S OUT AND SLAMMED INTO HER

00:38:51.862 --> 00:38:53.164
LEAVING HER WITH THREE BROKEN

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:53.931
BONES AND LIKE REQUIRING

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:55.733
SURGERY. POLICIES THAT ARE

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.802
IMPLEMENTED DIGITALLY WITHOUT

00:38:57.868 --> 00:39:00.004
PHYSICAL SIGNAGE OR

00:39:00.071 --> 00:39:03.641
COMMUNICATION TO WRITERS ABOUT

00:39:03.708 --> 00:39:05.309
AUTOMATIC WRIST. THE INCREASE

00:39:05.376 --> 00:39:08.446
ABILITY FOR IS IMPOSING. CITIES

00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:09.046
MUST HAVE AN TO MOBILITY DATA

00:39:09.113 --> 00:39:10.848
AS PUBLIC OF TRANSFER FOR. WELL

00:39:10.915 --> 00:39:12.016
PRIVATE MOBILITY COMPANIES MAY

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:14.385
SPELLS TO SOLVE CONGESTION

00:39:14.452 --> 00:39:15.686
REDUCE TRAFFIC FATALITIES AND

00:39:15.753 --> 00:39:17.254
EXPAND EQUITABLE ACCESS TO

00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:19.223
SERVICES I BELIEVE IT IS PUBLIC

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:21.392

00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.156
THIS IS FOR DATA BUT IT'S ALSO

TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM TRY TO

01:00:24.988 --> 01:00:26.089

FEEL IS GETTING WORSE NOT

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:11.334
BETTER. I WOULD SAY. OKAY THIS

01:01:11.401 --> 01:01:14.370
IS THE FACT ELECTION. OF SO HOW

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:35.258
OTHER PANELISTS CAN COMMENT

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:37.427
ALSO MINOR QUESTION IS A MINOR

01:01:37.493 --> 01:01:39.228
QUESTION BUT I THINK IT'S A NO

01:01:39.295 --> 01:01:40.997
IT'S A PUBLIC POLICY QUESTION I

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:44.767
MEAN I ALSO WANT TO THROW IN

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:46.302

ENVIRONMENTAL MANDATES. WE HAVE

01:01:58.514 --> 01:01:59.615
THE AMERICAN DISABILITIES ACT

01:01:59.682 --> 01:02:05.321
MANDATES. WE HAVE CONDITIONS

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:07.223
THAT THEY IMPOSE US ON EVERY

01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:09.992
SINGLE NICKEL OF ANY KIND OF

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:11.727
FEDERAL MONEY WE GET FROM.

01:02:11.794 --> 01:02:12.762
YELLOW SO YOU HAVE TO DO THE

01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:13.996
SYSTEM THIS SHIP TO FILE THIS

01:02:14.063 --> 01:02:16.432
REPORT YOU HAVE TO DO A SEQUEL

01:02:16.499 --> 01:02:19.302
YOU HAVE TO DO. NEED ALL THIS

TO BUILD THE TRANSIT SYSTEMS TO

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:27.844
BUILD VARIOUS THINGS. SO MAYBE

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:28.344
MAYBE THAT WOULD BE THE

01:02:28.411 --> 01:02:31.581

I'LL I'LL START OFF- AND LET'S

01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:34.250
TALK ABOUT KIND OF THE

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:35.651
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE CAN

01:02:35.718 --> 01:02:37.887
DO WITH AGGREGATE AND

01:02:37.954 --> 01:02:38.521
DISAGGREGATED DATA YEAH THAT'S

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:39.922
AND IF YOU'RE BEGINNING POINT

01:02:39.989 --> 01:02:41.657
PLEASE- AND LET'S USE THE

01:02:41.724 --> 01:02:44.327
EXAMPLE OF TRANSIT- BECAUSE I

01:02:44.393 --> 01:02:46.629
THINK- THAT SOMETHING THAT WE

01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:49.966
ALL ARE FAMILIAR WITH- AND

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:52.902
DETERMINE. WE CAN WE CAN LEARN

01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:56.873
A LOT FROM. THE AGGREGATE

01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:59.475
BEHAVIORS LET'S SAY THE

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:01.110
BOARDINGS AT ALIGHTINGS AT

01:03:01.177 --> 01:03:03.279
TRANSIT STOPS AND WE CAN LEARN

01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:06.048
A LOT ABOUT DEMAND ON A TRANSIT

01:03:06.115 --> 01:03:09.952
pSAID ALIGHTINGS ON THOSE STOPS

01:03:10.019 --> 01:03:13.356
FOR EXAMPLE WE DON'T HAVE. BUT

01:03:13.422 --> 01:03:14.957
THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO WITH THAT

01:03:15.024 --> 01:03:20.029
DATA WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA OF.

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:24.667
WHAT THE COLLECTION OF PEOPLE

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:28.504
TOGETHER ACTUALLY WE DON'T KNOW

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:29.372
ANYTHING ABOUT THE COLLECTION

01:03:29.438 --> 01:03:30.973
OF PEOPLE TOGETHER SO WITH

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:33.009
THEREFORE DON'T KNOWS THAT IF

01:03:33.075 --> 01:03:35.044
WE WERE TO MAKE A CHANGE HOW

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:38.447
THAT CHANGE MIGHT- HAVE WHAT

01:03:38.514 --> 01:03:40.183
KIND OF REACTION THERE MIGHT BE

01:03:40.249 --> 01:03:42.018
TO A CHANGE IN SERVICE BECAUSE

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:43.586
WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ENOUGH

01:03:43.653 --> 01:03:47.190
AND INFORMATION ABOUT PEOPLE'S

01:03:47.256 --> 01:03:50.526
PARTICULAR PREFERENCE SO IF WE

01:03:50.593 --> 01:03:52.929
HAVE SOME INFORMATION ON

01:03:52.995 --> 01:03:55.198
INTERVIEWS OF PEOPLE OVER ON

01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:57.867
THE REAL ACTIVITIES EACH PERSON

01:03:57.934 --> 01:03:59.402
IS DOING IN TERMS OF THEIR

01:03:59.468 --> 01:04:01.871
TRAVEL BEHAVIOR WHICH IS WHAT

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:02.939
WE DO IN TRAVEL DIARIES THAN

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:05.975
HAVE DONE- THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT

01:04:06.042 --> 01:04:08.778
HOW THAT DATA ARE HOW THOSE IN

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:09.378
THE TOOLS AND THE-

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:14.317
CHARACTERISTICS. REACT. TO

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:15.518
THREE ARE TO REALIZE BILLET THE

01:04:15.585 --> 01:04:16.686
REVISED TO SERVE CALL AND SO.

01:04:16.752 --> 01:04:18.621
AND FROM THAT INFORMATION WE

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.623
CAN THEN BUILD UP THE MODELS

01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:22.592
THAT WE NEED TO PREDICT ON A

01:04:22.658 --> 01:04:24.794
MORE AGGREGATE BASIS ACT SO

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:26.362
WITH THE BOTTOM OF THIS WE

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:27.463
ALWAYS NEED TO HAVE SOME

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:29.365
INFORMATION ABOUT. ABOUT THE

01:04:29.432 --> 01:04:32.868
INDIVIDUALS THANKS- I THINK I

WOULD WHAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE A

01:04:34.136 --> 01:04:36.772
POINT ABOUT REAL TIME VERSUS

01:04:36.839 --> 01:04:39.809
NOT REAL TIME DATA- WHEN WE'RE

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:41.010
DOING RESEARCH WE'RE DOING

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:43.379
RESEARCH ON HISTORICAL DATA-

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:46.048
WE'RE NOT. GENERALLY IN THIS

01:04:46.115 --> 01:04:47.717
TYPE OF RESEARCH WE'RE NOT

01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:49.118
GOING OUT TO WATCH PEOPLE WHAT

01:04:49.185 --> 01:04:50.019
THEY'RE DOING AT THE AT THE

01:04:50.086 --> 01:04:52.188
MOMENT. WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS

01:04:52.255 --> 01:04:55.191
LOOK AT X. POST- WHAT IS THAT

01:04:55.258 --> 01:04:56.459
BEHAVIOR SO THAT WE CAN

01:04:56.525 --> 01:04:59.562
UNDERSTAND. SO FOR US

01:04:59.629 --> 01:05:01.397
HISTORICAL DATA IS ACTUALLY

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:03.866
MORE WORTHWHILE THAN REAL TIME

01:05:03.933 --> 01:05:06.435
DATA. NOW YOU HAD A SECOND PART

01:05:06.502 --> 01:05:09.505
OF YOUR QUESTION JULY JUST- I

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:13.676
THINK. OKAY GIVE YOU ANOTHER

01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:18.247
EXAMPLE OKAY I AM. I PERPLEXED

MONEY CENTRAL CITY SO THE SAN

01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:25.955
FRANCISCO OKAY SO THEY WANT ME

01:05:26.022 --> 01:05:28.991
TO PROVE CONGESTION PRICING

01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:32.061
MECHANISM AS ALTERNATIVE WELL

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:33.696
SECOND WORK CAMINO AYE AYE AYE

01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:35.331
WHO ARE WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE

01:05:35.398 --> 01:05:35.998
THEY'RE CAUSING ALL THE

01:05:36.065 --> 01:05:37.800
CONGESTION WHERE THE COMING

01:05:37.867 --> 01:05:40.569
FROM- WHAT'S WHAT YOU KNOW IT'S

01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:44.206
A LOT POLLUTION AND I'VE BEEN

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:47.176
TOLD BY THE FROM GOVERNMENT.

01:05:47.243 --> 01:05:50.713
RID OF THIS POLLUTION. OF I'M

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:51.380
GOING TO GET PENALIZED IF I

01:05:51.447 --> 01:05:52.248
DON'T GET A REAL GONNA HAVE

01:05:52.315 --> 01:05:53.916
SOME CORPS WERE SOMETHING THIS

01:05:53.983 --> 01:05:56.018
IS A HAVE TO GIVE OF THE PULL.

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:57.386
BUT I DON'T WANT TO IMPOSE ON

01:05:57.453 --> 01:06:02.091
PEOPLE'S. PRIVATE INFORMATION

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:06.228
SO WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS ON AT

01:06:06.295 --> 01:06:06.996
THE READER THAT'S THAT'S AN

01:06:07.063 --> 01:06:10.232
EXIT IS THE- IS THE- SAN

01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:11.901
FRANCISCO ACTUALLY CONDUCTS

01:06:11.967 --> 01:06:15.104
THEIR OWN TRAVEL SERVICE YEAH-

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:16.238
AND THEN THEY GET INFORMATION-

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:17.573
WELL WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:18.941
FROM AND WHERE THEY'RE GOING ON

01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:21.277
AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. AND THEN

01:06:21.344 --> 01:06:23.145
THEY AGGREGATED UP BE ABLE TO

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:24.680
SAY WELL THIS IS WHERE THE

01:06:24.747 --> 01:06:27.383
DEMAND IS. THEY ALSO NEED THAT

01:06:27.450 --> 01:06:29.652
INFORMATION TO KNOW PEOPLE'S

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:31.854
PRICE SENSITIVITY TO YOUR

01:06:31.921 --> 01:06:33.055
QUESTION ABOUT HIS CONGESTION

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:34.223
PRICING GOING TO WORK THAT'S A

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:35.725
QUESTION OF PEOPLE'S PRICE

01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:37.760
SENSITIVITY SO WE NEED TO KNOW

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:40.096
THAT IN ADVANCE OR WE COULD

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:42.164
PRICE TOO HIGH A PRICE TO LOW

01:06:42.231 --> 01:06:43.532
WE CAN HAVE ALL KINDS OF.

01:06:43.599 --> 01:06:46.602
CONSEQUENCE AS A RESULT. I ALSO

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:48.137
WANT TO COME DOCTOR COOLEY SHE

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:52.108
STUDY THIS. YES THANK YOU OR

01:06:52.174 --> 01:06:53.409
FROM A RESEARCH HAS GOING I DO

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:55.411
I LIVE IN FEAR SCOTT AND WAS

01:06:55.478 --> 01:06:57.913
BORED IN SECOND SO A COUPLE I

01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.782
ACT OF KEY POINTS I'D LIKE TO

01:06:59.849 --> 01:07:00.916
MAKE AS A FORMER RESEARCHER I

01:07:00.983 --> 01:07:01.784
THINK THAT IT'S A REALLY

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.552
IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT

01:07:03.619 --> 01:07:05.855
THERE ARE FIRST DIFFERENT

01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:06.956
LEVELS OF AGGREGATION SO IT'S

01:07:07.022 --> 01:07:09.525
NOT A BINARY ISSUE OF ACT. ZIG

01:07:09.592 --> 01:07:11.127
DISSECTOR GET- VARIOUS LEVELS

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:12.928
OF RADIATION AND QUEEN THAT ARE

01:07:12.995 --> 01:07:14.263
VERY YOU BOTH FOR

01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:17.233
TRANSPORTATION RESEARCHERS- AND

01:07:17.299 --> 01:07:19.802
THEN THE SECOND POINT IS THAT

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:22.405
THERE ARE DIFFERENT SERVE

01:07:22.471 --> 01:07:22.905
DISAGGREGATED DATA I. A

01:07:22.972 --> 01:07:24.640
TRANSPORTATION RESEARCHER THAT

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:26.308
SPECIFICALLY DID TRAVEL DEMAND

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:28.110
MODELING SO FORECASTING THE

01:07:28.177 --> 01:07:30.813
FUTURE OF PROBABLE USING

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.815
TRAVEL. RAISING INDEED DIE

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:35.484
WHICH WERE OBTAINED WITH

01:07:35.551 --> 01:07:37.553
CONSENT OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:41.824
AND OFTEN WITH THE CONSENT OF A

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:43.359
SMALL SAMPLE OF THE VISUAL THAT.

01:07:43.426 --> 01:07:44.627
INSTALL AN APP WHEN THERE'S SO

01:07:44.693 --> 01:07:49.832
AND I WAS TRACK THEM. REST PER.

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:50.733
OF YOU IT FOR TRANSPORTATION

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.368
PLANNING THIS OVER COURSE OF

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:52.968
TIME THAT I BEEN A TRANCE. RE

01:07:53.035 --> 01:07:53.803
IT'S ACTUALLY BECOME INCREASE

01:07:53.869 --> 01:07:55.337
COMMON FOR OF TRAVEL DEMAND

01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:57.206
MODELERS TO PURCHASE THE TYPE

01:07:57.273 --> 01:07:59.508
OF DATA THAT NOW IS

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:01.777
INCREASINGLY SEEING A LOT OF

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:02.445
SCRUTINY SO CELLPHONE RACE

01:08:02.511 --> 01:08:04.980
DATA CAN TRACK UP TO TWELVE.

01:08:05.047 --> 01:08:06.749
MILLION PLUS AMERICANS SOME

01:08:06.816 --> 01:08:08.017
COMPANIES CLAIM TO BE ABLE TO

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:09.351
SEE ALL THE CELL PHONE DATA OF

01:08:09.418 --> 01:08:12.655
TEN PERCENT. OF THE CANS- IS

01:08:12.721 --> 01:08:13.756
VERY VALUABLE DATA FOR

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:16.759
TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH HOWEVER

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:18.727
I WILL SAY THAT IT ALSO STILL

01:08:18.794 --> 01:08:20.863
DOESN'T ANSWER A LOT OF THE

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:21.363
BASIC QUESTION. BETTER

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.131
IMPORTANT TRANSPORTATION

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:24.200
RESEARCH- WHAT I PRODUCED A

01:08:24.266 --> 01:08:27.169
STUDY LOOKING AT. THE MODE

01:08:27.236 --> 01:08:30.272
SUBSTITUTION UBER AND LEFT AND

01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:33.309
THEN ALL SUBSEQUENTLY THE MODES

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:34.610
STATE USED FOR MICROBIOLOGY.

01:08:34.677 --> 01:08:38.280
THE WAY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION

01:08:38.347 --> 01:08:42.451
IS TO WE ASK PEOPLE. PAPER OR

01:08:42.518 --> 01:08:46.188
ON BOARD. WHAT ESTRACE DATA

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:47.356
THAT TRACK THE MOVEMENT OF

01:08:47.423 --> 01:08:48.491
THEIR TRIP SO I THINK IT'S VERY

01:08:48.557 --> 01:08:50.059
TO ME THE YOU CASE TO THE KEY

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:51.794
RE QUESTION AND THE TYPE OF

01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:53.162
DATA THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED FOR

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:55.664
THAT PURPOSE AND THEN A FINAL

01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:57.800
POINT THAT'LL MAKE IS I SERVE

01:08:57.867 --> 01:08:59.502
ON- DIFFERENT STANDING

01:08:59.568 --> 01:09:00.336
COMMITTEES OF THE

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:01.704
TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH BOARD

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.639
OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES I WAS

01:09:03.706 --> 01:09:04.974
JUST AT A CONFERENCE IN

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.675
WASHINGTON DC THEIR ANNUAL

01:09:06.742 --> 01:09:08.277
MEETING WHERE BIKESHARE

01:09:08.344 --> 01:09:09.812
RESEARCHERS WERE PRESENTING

01:09:09.879 --> 01:09:13.516
WORK. ON AND- ANALYSIS KEY

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:15.050
RESEARCH QUESTIONS RELATED TO

01:09:15.117 --> 01:09:16.886
MICROBIOLOGY THEY SPENT

01:09:16.952 --> 01:09:18.487
PROBABLY SOMEWHERE ON THE ORDER

01:09:18.554 --> 01:09:20.122
OF TWELVE MONTHS COLLECTING

01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:21.991
HARVESTING AND CLEAN DATA

01:09:22.057 --> 01:09:23.526
SOURCES THAT ARE PUBLICLY

01:09:23.592 --> 01:09:25.227
AVAILABLE TO PRODUCE ANALYSIS

01:09:25.294 --> 01:09:27.997
IS THE AUTOMATED ON A PLATFORM

01:09:28.063 --> 01:09:30.399
THAT CAN BE USED SENATE MINUTES

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:32.635
I THINK COLLEGES INCREASE THE

01:09:32.701 --> 01:09:33.903
THERE IS MORE ABOUT THE PRIVATE

01:09:33.969 --> 01:09:35.604
SECTOR THAT ISN'T BEING MADE

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.206
AVAILABLE TO RESEARCHERS AND

01:09:37.273 --> 01:09:38.874
THAT'S A PROBLEM THAT WE WANT

01:09:38.941 --> 01:09:41.844
TO SOLVE AT POPULOUS AND THERE

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:44.847
IS TO GET THE DATA SO THAT

01:09:44.914 --> 01:09:48.317
RESEARCH. ACT TO KEEP A CHAT

01:09:48.384 --> 01:09:51.787
PUT UPON A ROAD OR GESTURE

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.188
THING DOES THE GET YOU TO THE

01:09:53.255 --> 01:09:58.894
GOAL THANK YOU AIMED TO STRIVE

01:09:58.961 --> 01:10:08.537
FOR IN A MATTER OF MY. SO THAT

01:10:08.604 --> 01:10:09.572
IS NECESSARY TO DO GOOD

01:10:09.638 --> 01:10:11.707
PLANNING SO YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY

01:10:11.774 --> 01:10:16.078
BUT. WE GOT SOME BIG PROBLEMS

01:10:16.145 --> 01:10:17.780
WE HAVE A TRANSIT RIDERSHIP

01:10:17.846 --> 01:10:19.648
GOING DOWN. AND WE DON'T WE

01:10:19.715 --> 01:10:21.317
DON'T KNOW HOW YOU KNOW WE ARE

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:23.552
THE GLOBAL WARMING CRISIS SOME

01:10:23.619 --> 01:10:24.119
PEOPLE WANT TO DO SOMETHING

01:10:24.186 --> 01:10:27.056
ABOUT IT. SO WE GOT OF REALLY

01:10:27.122 --> 01:10:29.858
GOOD INFORMATION TO. TOGETHER

01:10:29.925 --> 01:10:33.095
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND. OUR IS

01:10:33.162 --> 01:10:34.263
OUR INFORMATION THERE WERE NOT

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:36.498
A REALLY EVEN LOOKING AT RIGHT

01:10:36.565 --> 01:10:38.834
NOW THAT'S AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW.

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:41.203
IS THERE INFORMATION THAT WE

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:42.471
COULD USE RIGHT NOW THAT'S JUST

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:44.306
THERE THERE WERE NOT USING TO

01:10:44.373 --> 01:10:46.408
MAKE THESE DETERMINATION I WENT

01:10:46.475 --> 01:10:50.980
TO THE I SIT ON- VISOR

01:10:51.046 --> 01:10:53.315
COMMITTEE OF THE- UNIVERSITY

01:10:53.382 --> 01:10:55.851
CALIFORNIA- TRANSPORTATION

01:10:55.918 --> 01:11:00.155
RESEARCH INSTITUTE. AND WE HAD

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:02.024
OUR MEETING LAST LAST WEEK. AND

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:03.092
THEY ASKED ME WHAT DO YOU THINK

01:11:03.158 --> 01:11:04.026
THE MOST SO I SAID WE GOTTA

01:11:04.093 --> 01:11:05.260
START WE GOT TO DO WITH THIS

01:11:05.327 --> 01:11:06.829
CLIMATE CHANGE THING AND YOU

01:11:06.895 --> 01:11:08.163
GUYS HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHY

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:10.065
WE'RE HAVING A DROP IN TRANSIT

01:11:10.132 --> 01:11:14.703
RIDERSHIP. AND WE NEED IT NOW

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:15.270
WE CAN'T WE UP WE HAVE TO DO

01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:20.242
RESEARCH. SO. THERE'S PRESSING

01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:22.745
ISSUES IS WHAT I'M SAYING SO TO

01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:25.848
CONNECT FOR A YES SIR JACKSON

01:11:25.914 --> 01:11:28.150
WE HEARD BRIAN DAHLE THE WE

01:11:28.217 --> 01:11:30.986
HAVE- CENTER RUBIO AND CENTER

01:11:31.053 --> 01:11:33.322
DRAWS ON ON THIS YEAR- SKINNER

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:36.458
AND ON THIS ISSUE SO I THINK

01:11:36.525 --> 01:11:37.826
WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT THAT WE

01:11:37.893 --> 01:11:40.062
NEED TO ADD A TO TRY TO FIGURE

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:40.829
OUT WHAT'S GOING ON THE

01:11:40.896 --> 01:11:42.998
QUESTION IS WHAT DATA DO WE

01:11:43.065 --> 01:11:44.833
NEED. BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.435
DATA THAT WE COULD COLLECT AND

01:11:46.502 --> 01:11:48.671
FRANKLY I THINK IS BEING

01:11:48.737 --> 01:11:50.139
COLLECTED THAT ISN'T.

01:11:50.205 --> 01:11:52.608
NECESSARILY NECESSARY TO MAKE A

01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:54.877
DETERMINATION OF WHY ARE WE

01:11:54.943 --> 01:11:55.944
HAVING THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE

01:11:56.011 --> 01:11:57.880
HAVING. BUT THE ABILITY TO

01:11:57.946 --> 01:12:00.015
COLLECT DATA AND TO GET AS

01:12:00.082 --> 01:12:02.685
GRANULAR AS KNOWING WHAT TIME

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:04.486
IN THE MORNING A PERSON LEAVES.

01:12:04.553 --> 01:12:05.788
TO GO TO WORK IF THEY MAKE

01:12:05.854 --> 01:12:07.523
STOPS ON THE WAY IF THEY MAKE

01:12:07.589 --> 01:12:09.391
STOPS ON THE WAY BACK OR IF

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:11.326
THEY MEET PEOPLE IN. THANKS TO

01:12:11.393 --> 01:12:14.830
TRULY ARE ALMOST VOYEURISTIC.

01:12:14.897 --> 01:12:17.633
SO I GUESS MY QUESTION IS TO

01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:20.169
MISS- SIVARAMAN I DO WANT TO

01:12:20.235 --> 01:12:21.336
SAY I FIND IT REALLY

01:12:21.403 --> 01:12:22.838
INTERESTING APPRECIATE YOUR

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:23.672
CONCERN ABOUT THE PUBLIC

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:26.275
SECTOR- PERHAPS THIS IS A TURN

01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:27.876
OF EVENTS FOR UBER WHICH IS NOT

01:12:27.943 --> 01:12:29.912
NECESSARILY BEEN. THE BEST

01:12:29.978 --> 01:12:31.513
STEWARD AND THE MOST

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.849
RESPONSIBLE- COLLECTOR OF

01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:36.518
INFORMATION OR COMPANY BUT I'M

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:38.887
I'M DELIGHTED THAT DID IF AT

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:39.455
LEAST FROM THE SOUNDS OF IT

01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:41.990
THERE'S BEEN A- A TURN AROUND

01:12:42.057 --> 01:12:45.360
AS FAR AS- RECOGNIZING. THAT

01:12:45.427 --> 01:12:48.697
WHAT IS AND IS NOT APPROPRIATE-

01:12:48.764 --> 01:12:49.832
AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:12:49.898 --> 01:12:51.834
REGULATION SO PART OF WHAT I

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.368
THINK WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE.

01:12:53.435 --> 01:12:55.637
IS TO CREATE SOME REGULATION

01:12:55.704 --> 01:12:57.239
THAT WILL GIVE US INFORMATION

01:12:57.306 --> 01:12:58.841
THAT'S NEEDED WHICH WILL ALSO

01:12:58.907 --> 01:13:01.009
AT THE SAME TIME TELL PEOPLE

01:13:01.076 --> 01:13:02.745
THAT THIS INFORMATION IS BEING

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:04.546
COLLECTED ABOUT THEM MOST

01:13:04.613 --> 01:13:06.014
PEOPLE GET ON A SCOOTER AND

01:13:06.081 --> 01:13:07.282
THEY THINK THEY'RE TRUST TAKEN.

01:13:07.349 --> 01:13:09.418
SOMEWHERE AND THAT'S THE END OF

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:11.520
IT BUT IN FACT ALL SORTS OF

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:13.355
PERSONAL DATA IS BEING

01:13:13.422 --> 01:13:13.989
COLLECTED AND THEY DON'T EVEN

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:17.593
KNOW IT. SO IF YOU DO A SURVEY

01:13:17.659 --> 01:13:18.894
YOU ASKED PEOPLE TO TELL YOU

01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:20.929
SOMETHING THEY WILL PARTICIPATE

01:13:20.996 --> 01:13:23.065
IF THEY KNOW AND IF THEY ARE

01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:25.200
OKAY WITH THAT. NOW WERE

01:13:25.267 --> 01:13:26.935
ESSENTIALLY SERVING PEOPLE AND

01:13:27.002 --> 01:13:28.237
SURVEILLING THEM AT THE SAME

01:13:28.303 --> 01:13:30.873
TIME SO. DO YOU HAVE ANY

01:13:30.939 --> 01:13:32.708
SUGGESTIONS BASED UPON. MISTER

01:13:32.775 --> 01:13:34.476
SNOW'S COMMENT WHICH I THREE

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:36.912
TWO WEEKS WE SHOULD WE NEED TO

01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:38.080
NARAL WHAT IT IS WE'RE LOOKING

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:41.750
FOR. AND WE NEED TO GET

01:13:41.817 --> 01:13:43.452
PERMISSION OR AT LEAST GIVE

01:13:43.519 --> 01:13:44.586
PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE

01:13:44.653 --> 01:13:47.656
AWARE OF THIS AND MAKE CHOICE

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:51.426
WITH A ONE. INFORMATION IN.

01:13:51.493 --> 01:13:52.928
THIS GROUP DID ARE BEFORE WE GO

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:54.563
AHEAD AND DO IT SO ANY THOUGHTS

01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:57.299
ON THAT. DO YOU AGREE DISAGREE

01:13:57.366 --> 01:13:59.368
WITH HOW DO WE GET TO WHAT WE

01:13:59.434 --> 01:14:00.235
NEED TO DO FOR POLICY WILL AT

01:14:00.302 --> 01:14:02.070
THE SAME TIME BALANCING THE

01:14:02.137 --> 01:14:03.839
PRIVACY RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS

01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:05.774
INFORMATION WE'RE TAKING.

01:14:05.841 --> 01:14:07.609
ABSOLUTELY AND THANK YOU VERY

01:14:07.676 --> 01:14:10.112
MUCH FOR THE QUESTION- I THINK

01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:12.815
THAT- THE QUESTION OF WHAT

01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:14.917
GOALS WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE

01:14:14.983 --> 01:14:16.718
AND WHAT WHAT PROBLEMS WE'RE

01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:18.620
TRYING TO SOLVE CONCRETELY

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:19.788
THAT'S HAT WE EED TO

01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:21.190
DETERMINE FIRST BECAUSE FROM

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:22.958
THERE WE CAN DETERMINE WHAT

01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:25.294
DATA IS APPROPRIATE. ACTUALLY

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.696
SOLVING THOSE GOALS NOW THERE

01:14:27.763 --> 01:14:29.832
ARE SOME GOALS- THAT CAN USE

01:14:29.898 --> 01:14:32.134
AGGREGATED DATA AND DOCTOR

01:14:32.201 --> 01:14:34.203
GIULIANI ROUTE WOULD BE ON A

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:35.604
ROCK RAN THROUGH SOME OF THOSE

01:14:35.671 --> 01:14:36.772
BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT WILL

01:14:36.839 --> 01:14:39.875
REQUIRE DISAGGREGATED DATA AND

01:14:39.942 --> 01:14:40.442
WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE IT'S

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:42.811
RICK IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT.

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:44.780
THAT WOULD ALLOW USERS TO OPT

01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:49.151
OUT OF THEIR PERSONAL DATA IF

01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:52.054
THEY SO CHOOSE RIGHT AN EXAMPLE

01:14:52.120 --> 01:14:52.588
THAT I TYPICALLY GIVES YOU

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:54.489

SHARING YOUR REAL TIME. WITH

01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:08.904
YOU CAN CROSS AND SEND A ARE.

01:15:08.971 --> 01:15:10.539
I'M USE TO OPT OUT OF SHARE

01:15:10.606 --> 01:15:11.306
THEIR LOOK DATA WHETHER IT'S

01:15:11.373 --> 01:15:12.541
FOR PER ENTITY OR A PUBLIC

01:15:12.608 --> 01:15:15.010
ENTITY IS ABSOLUTELY KEY AND

01:15:15.077 --> 01:15:16.712
MORE BROADLY SPEAKING GIVING

01:15:16.778 --> 01:15:19.248
USERS MORE CONTROL OVER WHAT

01:15:19.314 --> 01:15:21.083
DATA THEY CHOOSE TO SHARE AGAIN

01:15:21.149 --> 01:15:22.651
WITH ANY ENTITY AND THE PUBLIC

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:24.052
SECTOR AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR

01:15:24.119 --> 01:15:25.721
THE NONPROFIT SPACE IS

01:15:25.787 --> 01:15:28.690
ABSOLUTELY KEY AND SO AGAIN

01:15:28.757 --> 01:15:31.093
FIGURING OUT THE USE CASES FOR

01:15:31.159 --> 01:15:33.195
SOLVING THE CRITICAL GOALS MANY

01:15:33.262 --> 01:15:35.264
OF WHICH ARE SENATOR BELL

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:36.531
REFERENCED FIGURING OUT

01:15:36.598 --> 01:15:38.233
CONCRETE USE CASES AND WORKING

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:40.769
BACKWARDS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT

01:15:40.836 --> 01:15:42.537
AS REQUIRED FOR THOSE USE CASES

01:15:42.604 --> 01:15:43.839
IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL AND

01:15:43.906 --> 01:15:46.642
GIVING USED TOYS AND BOOKS

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:49.678
ABILITY. IS ALSO CRITICAL. THE

01:15:49.745 --> 01:15:52.581
SERVER JACKSON FINISHED- YES

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:53.515
JUST WANTED COMMISSIONER

01:15:53.582 --> 01:15:56.485
SANTIAGO OVERCOME AS WELL- YOU

01:15:56.551 --> 01:15:58.553
KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME

01:15:58.620 --> 01:15:59.221
COMMENT ABOUT THE USEFULNESS OF

01:15:59.288 --> 01:16:01.690
SURVEY DATA- I THINK SUPPORT TO

EXAMPLE- IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:25.440
VENICE WHICH WAS AN INCREDIBLY

01:17:25.507 --> 01:17:26.975
ATTRACTIVE NEIGHBORHOOD FOR A

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:28.143
LOT OF SCOOTER COMPANIES TO

01:17:28.210 --> 01:17:29.144

COMPETITIVE MARKET EVERYBODY'S

01:17:32.814 --> 01:17:33.682
TRYING TO GET MARKET. WE HAD

ABOUT THREE THOUSAND VEHICLES

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:37.819
DEPLOYED IN ABOUT A ONE SQUARE

01:17:37.886 --> 01:17:40.155
MILE AREA WHICH IS AN

01:17:40.222 --> 01:17:42.424
OVERSATURATION SO WE HAD OUR

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:43.658
STAFF GO OUT AND ACTUALLY

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:46.561

SAFE STORAGE OF THESE THINGS.

01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:56.538

01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:01.576
VERY RULES ABOUT HOW MANY

01:18:01.643 --> 01:18:03.478

DEPLOY BY A SPECIFIC TIME EVERY

01:18:06.281 --> 01:18:08.884
DAY. SO WE HAVE TO GO OUT THERE

01:18:08.950 --> 01:18:11.319
AND SPOT CHECK THAT BUT WE'RE

01:18:11.386 --> 01:18:12.687
ABLE AND WHEN WE VERIFY THE

01:18:12.754 --> 01:18:14.856
DATA IS LEGITIMATE AND WE SEE

01:18:14.923 --> 01:18:17.025
THE DIPLOMA ENDS AND THE

01:18:17.092 --> 01:18:17.592
NOTIFICATIONS ARE HAPPENING.

01:18:17.659 --> 01:18:20.562
THEN WE CAN THAT FROM DOWNTOWN

01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:22.731
AND WE CAN TELL COMPANIES. YOU

01:18:22.798 --> 01:18:24.332
WERE ALLOWED TO DEPLOY FIVE

01:18:24.399 --> 01:18:25.400
SCOOTERS ON THIS CORNER AT NINE

01:18:25.467 --> 01:18:28.670

BILLETED TO BE IN THE VENICE

01:18:36.678 --> 01:18:39.581
AREA AT ALL. SO I KIND OF

01:18:39.648 --> 01:18:41.216
INFORMATION AND BEING ABLE TO

01:18:41.283 --> 01:18:44.753
GO OUT WHEN I HAVE A VERY SMALL

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:46.855
TEAM TO HAVE. AN EDGE TO BE

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:47.456
EIGHT THOUSAND SCOOTERS THAT

01:18:47.522 --> 01:18:48.123
CAN GO OUT. THE GET ON A

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:50.625
VEHICLE. AND I CAN SEE IN REAL

01:18:50.692 --> 01:18:52.394
TIME DID THE COMPANY SEND AND

01:18:52.461 --> 01:18:55.831
BECAME AS THE- THEY WERE. AND A

01:18:55.897 --> 01:19:01.269
THEY DO. WHEN WE TRY ALL OF THE

01:19:01.336 --> 01:19:03.338
DATA THAT HAVE FOR THEM. SO IT

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:06.341
IF IT'S REAL TIME IN ONLY DOING

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:09.444
IT. YOU'RE NOT DOING IT I'M- IT

01:19:09.511 --> 01:19:10.879
IT'S- GETTING THE MEASURE FOR

01:19:10.946 --> 01:19:15.217
MEASURE AFTER THE RIGHT. ON THE

01:19:15.283 --> 01:19:15.817
ROUTE THE ROUTE ITSELF SO I

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:16.418
DON'T KNOW. IF YOU PICKED UP A

01:19:16.485 --> 01:19:17.018
SCHOOL AT ONE LOOK. IN DROPPED

01:19:17.085 --> 01:19:17.886
OFFPOR EL I DON'T KNOW WHY

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:19.387
ROUTE TOOK IN THE- OR IF STOP.

01:19:19.454 --> 01:19:21.089
UNTIL OUR YOU OFF VEHICLE SO

01:19:21.156 --> 01:19:21.990
WHEN THE WHEN THE VEHICLES

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:23.558

01:19:23.625 --> 01:19:24.860
THAN ANY OF YOU CAN YOU CAN

01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:26.261
MONITOR THAT AS WELL THAT'S

01:19:26.328 --> 01:19:28.430
RIGHT SO WE HAD FOR EXAMPLE- A

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:30.065
COUPLE OF EMERGENCIES WHERE WE

01:19:30.132 --> 01:19:32.067
NEEDED TO LET COMPANIES KNOW.

01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:34.002
HEY WE GOT A FIRE HAPPENING WE

01:19:34.069 --> 01:19:36.338
NEED WE NEED TO MAKE THAT YOU

01:19:36.404 --> 01:19:37.772
AS WELL ARE YOU HERE ARE

01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:40.275
EVACUATION ROUTES- CAN SKI IF

01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:40.976
THERE ARE. OTHER CLEAR FOR

01:19:41.042 --> 01:19:42.511
FIRST RESPONDERS AND ALL THOSE

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:44.646
KINDS OF THINGS THEY ALSO HAVE

01:19:44.713 --> 01:19:46.181
CAPS ON THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES

01:19:46.248 --> 01:19:47.649
THAT ALLOWED TO HAPPEN SPECIFIC

01:19:47.716 --> 01:19:49.751
NEIGHBORHOODS- AND SO WE'RE

01:19:49.818 --> 01:19:51.820
ABLE TO SEE ON A DAY TO DAY

01:19:51.887 --> 01:19:54.089
BASIS. ARE THERE A- TO POINT

01:19:54.156 --> 01:19:54.789
WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO AND

01:19:54.856 --> 01:19:58.360
THEY PAYING US THE- THE FEE FOR

01:19:58.426 --> 01:20:05.200
THAT. OR ARE THEY NOT. I THINK

01:20:05.267 --> 01:20:07.135
THAT'S THAT'S THOSE ARE SOME OF

01:20:07.202 --> 01:20:10.739
THE EXAMPLES ARE. USE CASE IS

01:20:10.805 --> 01:20:11.706
IT. THIS TO ME SURE THE COME.

01:20:11.773 --> 01:20:13.108
ARE HONEST WITH US ABOUT THE

01:20:13.175 --> 01:20:14.676
DATA THEY'RE PROVIDING. RIGHT

01:20:14.743 --> 01:20:15.844
BUT YOU KNOW THE START AND THE

01:20:15.911 --> 01:20:18.280
STOP TIME SO THAT'S THE YOU CAN

01:20:18.346 --> 01:20:18.847
TELL WE'RE SOMEBODY'S GOING

01:20:18.914 --> 01:20:20.282
THEN. BUT BY THAT DATE IT

01:20:20.348 --> 01:20:22.484
CRACKED. WELL I CAN TELL WHERE

01:20:22.551 --> 01:20:23.919
A SCOOTER START WHERE SCOOTER

01:20:23.985 --> 01:20:26.288
STRIP THAT UNLOCKED AND WE'RE

01:20:26.354 --> 01:20:27.522
SCOOTER GOT RE LOCKED THAT'S

01:20:27.589 --> 01:20:29.357
RIGHT. SO WORD REAL QUICK I

01:20:29.424 --> 01:20:31.226
HAVE JUST A COUPLE MORE ONE AS

01:20:31.293 --> 01:20:33.628
THE POPULOUS FOLKS FROM. DR

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:36.164
COOLER. YES SO DO YOU DO YOU

01:20:36.231 --> 01:20:38.400
GET DOES LAW ENFORCEMENT ASK

01:20:38.466 --> 01:20:42.637
YOU FOR INFORMATION. ARE WE

01:20:42.704 --> 01:20:43.972
HAVE NEVER HAD LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:20:44.039 --> 01:20:46.141
ASK US DIRECTLY FOR INFORMATION

01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:49.511
BUT WE ARE AWARE OF AT LEAST

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:50.979
TWO CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE CITIES

01:20:51.046 --> 01:20:52.781
THAT WERE OUR CUSTOMERS WERE

01:20:52.847 --> 01:20:55.150
ASKED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR

01:20:55.217 --> 01:20:56.885
SPECIFIC TRIP INFORMATION.

01:20:56.952 --> 01:20:59.221
INCLUDING CALIFORNIA. OKAY

01:20:59.287 --> 01:21:01.356
BECAUSE I HEARD- THE PERSON

01:21:01.423 --> 01:21:03.525
FROM UBER SAY THAT THAT'S

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:05.594
PRIVATE INFORMATION IT NEEDS TO

01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:09.364
BE DONE BY SUBPOENA. SO I AM

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:10.932
VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN THIS

01:21:10.999 --> 01:21:12.968
AREA ACTUALLY I'M DOING A BILL

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:14.769
THIS YEAR BECAUSE THE DMV'S

01:21:14.836 --> 01:21:15.370
ACTUALLY SELLING OUR

01:21:15.437 --> 01:21:17.405
INFORMATION. AND I DON'T THINK

01:21:17.472 --> 01:21:19.441
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- MOST OF

01:21:19.507 --> 01:21:21.509
CALIFORNIANS WOULD AGREE WITH-

01:21:21.576 --> 01:21:22.978
AND THEY'RE DOING IT WITHOUT A

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:23.912
SUBPOENA THEY'RE SELLING MY

01:21:23.979 --> 01:21:25.480
DRIVER'S LICENSE WHAT KIND OF

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:27.482
VEHICLE I HAVE. AND SO I HAVE A

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:28.650
BILL ON THAT SO MY LAST

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:30.285
QUESTION AND THEN I TAKE THE

01:21:30.352 --> 01:21:31.286
CHAIRS FOR THIS COMMITTEE I

01:21:31.353 --> 01:21:32.988
THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

01:21:33.054 --> 01:21:34.155
CALIFORNIA'S NEED TO BE

01:21:34.222 --> 01:21:36.358
WEIGHING IN HEAVILY ON ABOUT.

01:21:36.424 --> 01:21:41.663
OUR RIVER. AND THE GETS. WORK

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:42.897
ON DRONE TOGETHER ABOUT WHAT

01:21:42.964 --> 01:21:44.766
PEOPLE MONITORING- US WITH

BEING RAISED IN THIS HEARING

01:22:16.631 --> 01:22:18.933
ARE ABSOLUTELY PERTINENT. THE

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.604

CONTAINED IN THE ANNUAL REPORT

01:22:26.241 --> 01:22:27.676
HOWEVER WE STILL DO HAVE A

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:29.611
RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO

LIBRARIES ON THE LAWN FORCING

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:48.096
QUESTION I DO THINK THAT ONE OF

01:22:48.163 --> 01:22:49.464
THE KEY VALUES BECAUSE ONE OF

01:22:49.531 --> 01:22:50.999
THE KEY CHALLENGES THAT I SAW

01:22:51.066 --> 01:22:52.167
WITH MANY PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT

01:22:52.233 --> 01:22:54.336
WERE- SEEKING TO OBTAIN

01:22:54.402 --> 01:22:56.137

01:22:56.204 --> 01:22:58.306
RIDES THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS THAT

01:22:58.373 --> 01:22:59.674
WERE LARGELY FUNDED BY THE

01:22:59.741 --> 01:23:00.709
FEDERAL TRANSIT ADMINISTRATION

01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:03.678
WISE KALENJIN WITH OPEN RECORDS

GENERAL PUBLIC COMPETITOR. AND

01:23:08.883 --> 01:23:09.351
THEN ALSO THE ISSUE OF LAW

01:23:09.417 --> 01:23:13.355
ENFORCEMENT- ONE PERSON FALLS

01:23:13.421 --> 01:23:13.855
WITHIN I THINK A SPECIAL

01:23:13.922 --> 01:23:14.422
CATEGORY AND ONE OF THE KEY

01:23:14.489 --> 01:23:16.224
CHALLENGES WE SEEN IS THAT IN

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:18.993
MANY CIRCUMSTANCES OUR CUSTOMER

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:21.730
IS THE CITIES SO THE CITY OF

01:23:21.796 --> 01:23:23.832
WHICH I ALSO CAN IN THE

01:23:23.898 --> 01:23:31.272
DEPARTMENT- UNFORCED AND- GOLD.

01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:32.340
THOSE REQUESTS BEEN IN A-

01:23:32.407 --> 01:23:33.942
REQUEST. WE HAVE SEEN IN RICK.

01:23:34.008 --> 01:23:35.677
FROM LAW. WELL THERE WAS

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:36.978
ACTUALLY A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE

01:23:37.045 --> 01:23:38.880
THERE WAS A HOMICIDE IN A CITY

01:23:38.947 --> 01:23:41.216
WHERE. APPARENTLY TO SCORE TWO

01:23:41.282 --> 01:23:43.318
YEARS WERE SEEN AT THE SCENE OF

01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:44.052
THE CRIME AND WERE THOUGHT TO

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:46.020
BE THE GETAWAY VEHICLES. ARE

01:23:46.087 --> 01:23:48.256
ACTIVE THEN ASKED THE BIKES

01:23:48.323 --> 01:23:49.691
YOUR PLANNER SO IN OUR

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:50.558
CIRCUMSTANCE BECAUSE WERE

01:23:50.625 --> 01:23:52.293
HANDLING LOTS A LOT OF SCOOTER

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.596
AND DATA IT'S ACTUALLY THE NEXT

01:23:54.662 --> 01:23:55.497
YEAR PLANNER THAT'S BEING ASKED

01:23:55.563 --> 01:23:57.899
BY LAW ENFORCED. AND FROM WHAT

01:23:57.966 --> 01:24:00.135
WE CAN TELL MIKE SURE PLANNERS

01:24:00.201 --> 01:24:02.404
DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE A LOT OF

01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:03.004
TRAINING AND HOW TO DEAL WITH

01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:04.339
THESE PARTICULAR TYPES OF

01:24:04.406 --> 01:24:06.207
REQUIRE. AND I THINK THAT THE

01:24:06.274 --> 01:24:08.410
VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE KNOW

01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:10.779
THAT IT'S OBVIOUS THAT NAMES

01:24:10.845 --> 01:24:14.749
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER IS. IT

01:24:14.816 --> 01:24:16.785
DRESS PERSON STATION I THINK IF

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:18.586
YOU'RE WHO BACK THE SENSITIVE

01:24:18.653 --> 01:24:19.888
NATURE OF TO LOOK DATA AND SO

01:24:19.954 --> 01:24:21.723
IT IS A CHAO SUCH FOR THAT

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:24.192
REASON WE ARE OF A NUMBER OF

01:24:24.259 --> 01:24:25.927
INDUSTRY AND CITY ORGANIZED

01:24:25.994 --> 01:24:27.495
GROUPS TO HELP DEVELOP BEST

01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:28.696
PRACTICES AROUND HOW TO DEAL

01:24:28.763 --> 01:24:30.498
WITH THESE TYPES OF REQUESTS.

01:24:30.565 --> 01:24:32.100
TO MON APOLOGIZE FOR AGNES WAS

01:24:32.167 --> 01:24:33.368
I REALLY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:41.576
DO WE ARE PRIVATE COMPANY OUR

01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:44.245
CUSTOMERS. ARE CITIES. SO HOW

CAN'T COME TO YOU FOR YOUR

01:24:47.415 --> 01:24:48.917
PRIVATE COMPANY YOU DO YOU.

01:24:48.983 --> 01:24:50.285
WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A SUBPOENA

01:24:50.351 --> 01:24:52.554
FOR THAT INFORMATION CORRECT-

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:52.987
WITH THE CASE OF LAW

01:24:53.054 --> 01:24:54.722
ENFORCEMENT. WHICH HAVE BEEN

01:24:54.789 --> 01:24:56.524
LARGELY INTERNAL REQUESTS TO

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:58.259
OUR CITY CUSTOMERS THE CITY

01:24:58.326 --> 01:25:00.195
CUSTOMERS THAT WE WORK WITHIN

01:25:00.261 --> 01:25:01.930
BOTH OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES DID

01:25:01.996 --> 01:25:02.864
NOT ACTUALLY HAVE THE

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:04.699
DISAGGREGATED ROCKCHIP

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:07.101
INFORMATION WE DID. AND WE ARE

01:25:07.168 --> 01:25:09.871
NOT AN INTERNAL REQUEST. AND SO

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.339
WE'VE CREATED ESSENTIALLY A

01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:13.575
BUFFER FOR THE CITY THEN TO

MORE EASILY RESPOND TO THAT

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:17.245
REQUEST BECAUSE THEY NEVER HAD

THE RAW DISAGREED INFORMATION

01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:19.948

GATHER AND WE AGREED YOU.

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:32.193
BECAUSE WITH OUR CITY COUNCIL

01:25:32.260 --> 01:25:33.428
AND ALSO WITH BILLY I. THAT

01:25:33.495 --> 01:25:34.863
THAT IS ONLY USED FOR THE

01:25:34.929 --> 01:25:38.066
PURPOSES OF TRANSPORTATION

01:25:38.132 --> 01:25:43.938
PLANNING AND WEALTHY THANK YOU.

01:25:44.005 --> 01:25:46.341
JUST HAD A QUESTION FOR MYSTERY.

01:25:46.407 --> 01:25:48.877
THERE WERE A- STATE MADE

01:25:48.943 --> 01:25:50.612
SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT I

01:25:50.678 --> 01:25:56.017
THINK- QUALITY. DR CLEVELAND

01:25:56.084 --> 01:25:58.653
ABOUT THE THREE APPROACHES AND

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:04.058
HOW THE CITY'S. IT'S THE IT'S

01:26:04.125 --> 01:26:05.260
BETTER TO HAVE A THIRD PARTY

01:26:05.326 --> 01:26:06.594
THIS IS WHAT I UNDERSTOOD TO

01:26:06.661 --> 01:26:08.096
HAVE A THIRD PARTY RATHER THAN

01:26:08.162 --> 01:26:10.031
A CITY DIRECTLY GET INVOLVED

01:26:10.098 --> 01:26:11.833
AND GET THE INFORMATION THINGS

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:14.035
LIKE RESOURCES THEY MIGHT NOT

01:26:14.102 --> 01:26:16.704
HAVE RESOURCES OR TAKE RISK AND

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:19.307
LIABILITY- HOW WOULD YOU

01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:22.210
RESPOND. TO THAT IN TERMS OF

01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:25.680
WHICH WOULD BE A BETTER WAY TO

01:26:25.747 --> 01:26:26.180
GO I THINK THAT THERE'S

01:26:26.247 --> 01:26:27.315
PROBABLY PROS AND CONS

01:26:27.382 --> 01:26:28.683
ASSOCIATED WITH EACH APPROACH

01:26:28.750 --> 01:26:31.185
AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IT'S

01:26:31.252 --> 01:26:33.888
REALLY VALUABLE FORCE TO BE

01:26:33.955 --> 01:26:38.159
ABLE TO. HOW LIKE TO WOULD LIKE

01:26:38.226 --> 01:26:40.795
TO HANDLE THAT DATA FOR A CITY

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:42.196
LIKE LOS ANGELES YOU KNOW WE

01:26:42.263 --> 01:26:45.266
STORE THE TUTOR DATA IN THE

01:26:45.333 --> 01:26:47.969
SAME WAY THAT WE HANDLE THE

01:26:48.036 --> 01:26:49.737

01:26:57.812 --> 01:26:59.914
TO HOW DINNER TAX TO THE DATA

01:26:59.981 --> 01:27:00.515
IT'S REALLY COLD FOR A VARIETY

01:27:00.582 --> 01:27:01.883
RE. AND HOW A THIRD PARTY

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:04.652
INTERMEDIARY BETWEEN US-

01:27:04.719 --> 01:27:05.720
DOESN'TALWAYS GIVE US THE SAME

01:27:05.787 --> 01:27:08.556
LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IN THE IN

01:27:08.623 --> 01:27:10.625
THE VERACITY OF THE DATA- THAT

01:27:10.692 --> 01:27:12.360

WOULD BE KIND OF PHYLLIS ARE

01:33:01.676 --> 01:33:03.544
LEGALLY DIFFERENT THAN WHAT A

WHY IT MIGHT WANT TO ALSO UNDER

01:33:04.912 --> 01:33:05.546
I AM I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE

01:33:05.613 --> 01:33:08.883

THE ROUTE. AND I'M WONDERING IF

01:33:24.332 --> 01:33:25.766
NOT THAT WHETHER YOU WOULD DO

01:33:25.833 --> 01:33:27.001
THIS BUT WHETHER YOU COULD IF

YOU CHOSE. MARKET PRODUCTS TO

01:33:30.104 --> 01:33:31.939
THOSE USERS BASED ON WHETHER

01:33:32.006 --> 01:33:33.541
STOPPING ALONG THE WAY- IF YOU

01:33:33.607 --> 01:33:35.977
BELIEVE THAT YOU. THE LEGAL

01:33:36.043 --> 01:33:38.412
ABILITY TO COLLECTED TO START

COLLECTING. THANK YOU FOR THE

01:33:55.563 --> 01:33:57.331
QUESTION I THINK ONE KEY

01:33:57.398 --> 01:33:59.000
DIFFERENCE IS THAT WE ARE

01:33:59.066 --> 01:34:01.235
REGULATED BY PRIVACY LAWS NOW

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:03.804
WHETHER THAT CC PA- CCPA

01:34:03.871 --> 01:34:05.773
APPLIES TO ONLY PRIVATE SECTOR

01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.975
BODIES AND THAT'S- QUITE A

01:34:08.042 --> 01:34:09.510
DISTINCTION FROM A LAW LIKE

01:34:09.577 --> 01:34:11.145
JEEP. FOR EXAMPLE IN THE U.

01:34:11.212 --> 01:34:12.546
THAT APPLIES TO BOTH THE

01:34:12.613 --> 01:34:13.748
PRIVATE SECTOR AND PUBLIC

01:34:13.814 --> 01:34:15.716
SECTOR ENTITIES I THINK A LAW

01:34:15.783 --> 01:34:18.652
LIKE THAT IS USEFUL BECAUSE- IT

01:34:18.719 --> 01:34:20.421
ACTUALLY UNLOCKS DATA SHARING

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:22.056
BETWEEN THE PRIVATE AND PUBLIC

01:34:22.123 --> 01:34:23.924
SECTORS IF WE FEEL THAT. OUR

01:34:23.991 --> 01:34:25.693
DATA IS BEING PROTECTED NO

01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:27.428
MATTER WHERE IT'S ORIGINATING

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:29.663
AND WHERE IT'S LANDING- THAN

01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:31.098
THAT UNLOCKS A LOT OF DATA

01:34:31.165 --> 01:34:33.667
SHARING THAT COULD BE HELPFUL

01:34:33.734 --> 01:34:34.969
IN THE UNITED STATES BUT I BUT

01:34:35.036 --> 01:34:36.237
AGAIN I THINK THE KEY DISTINCT.

01:34:36.303 --> 01:34:39.607
AND IS THAT THE CZ A. N. OPERA.

01:34:39.673 --> 01:34:42.043
A FORTHCOMING PRICE LAW MY TO

01:34:42.109 --> 01:34:44.545
BE USED APPLET TO THE PRIVATE

01:34:44.612 --> 01:34:46.447
SECTOR AND I THINK THAT. WE

01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:51.152
HAVE REAL LEGAL LIABILITY. WE

01:34:51.218 --> 01:34:52.753
MISSED YOU OR I SHOULD ARE THE

01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:56.590
BRIDGE. NAPA I THINK THAT IN

01:34:56.657 --> 01:34:58.459
GENERAL THERE'S AT THEIR A

01:34:58.526 --> 01:34:59.393
SHORTCUT PRIVACY IN THE U.

01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:02.797

ALL FOR COMING AND SHARING YOUR

01:39:25.926 --> 01:39:27.561
INSIGHTS WE ARE RUNNING A

01:39:27.628 --> 01:39:29.730
LITTLE OVER SO I'M GONNA TRY

MINUTES AND WILL- HOPE YOU HAVE

01:39:36.036 --> 01:39:36.570
SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU AT THE

01:39:36.637 --> 01:39:38.272
END OF THE PANEL SO WITH THAT-

01:39:38.339 --> 01:39:41.475
DOCTOR MATTHEW BISHOP THE FLOOR

01:39:41.542 --> 01:39:45.312
IS YOURS. THANK YOU FOR THE

01:39:45.379 --> 01:39:46.613
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE

01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:49.416
TODAY- AS YOU'VE HEARD DATA

01:39:49.483 --> 01:39:51.151
NEEDS TO BE RELEASED FOR

01:39:51.218 --> 01:39:53.120
ANALYSIS BY OTHERS. AND IF YOU

01:39:53.187 --> 01:39:55.089
CAN CONTROL WHO HAS ACCESS TO

01:39:55.155 --> 01:39:56.690
IT THEN YOU CAN TAKE DR JOHN IS

01:39:56.757 --> 01:39:58.592
APPROACHING USE- CYBER SECURITY

01:39:58.659 --> 01:40:01.028
CONTROLS. TO BLOCK THE TWO ARE

01:40:01.095 --> 01:40:02.596
PROTECTED. BUT IF YOU CAN'T

01:40:02.663 --> 01:40:03.964
CONTROL ACCESS OR IF YOU HAVE

01:40:04.031 --> 01:40:04.832
REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE

01:40:04.898 --> 01:40:07.735
ACCESS CONTROLS WON'T WORK-

01:40:07.801 --> 01:40:09.103
THEN YOU NEED TO USE DATA

01:40:09.169 --> 01:40:11.105
ANONYMOUS. SOMETIMES CALLED THE

01:40:11.171 --> 01:40:14.007
IDENTIFICATION OF SENSATION.

01:40:14.074 --> 01:40:17.077
THE PROBLEM WITH THIS IS THAT

01:40:17.144 --> 01:40:18.278
OFTEN INTERFERES WITH THE

01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:19.847
UTILITYOF THE USEFULNESS OF

01:40:19.913 --> 01:40:21.382
THE DATA AND SO YOU HAVE TO

01:40:21.448 --> 01:40:24.318
BALANCE THE NEED FOR THE DATA

01:40:24.385 --> 01:40:26.153
WITH THE EFFECT IT HAS ON

01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:28.021
RELEASING IT MIGHT HAVE ON BOTH

01:40:28.088 --> 01:40:29.323
THE OWNER OF THE DATA IN THE

01:40:29.390 --> 01:40:31.358
SUBJECT OF THE DATA AND HERE'S

01:40:31.425 --> 01:40:33.360
AN EXAMPLE AMERICA ONLINE AT

01:40:33.427 --> 01:40:35.028
ONE POINT RELEASED THREE MONTHS

01:40:35.095 --> 01:40:37.831
OF SEARCH RECORDS. AND THE VERY

01:40:37.898 --> 01:40:39.800
CAREFULLY ANONYMOUS THEM. IT

01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:42.002
WAS UP FOR THREE DAYS. DURING

01:40:42.069 --> 01:40:43.504
THAT TIME NEW YORK TIMES

01:40:43.570 --> 01:40:44.872
REPORTERS WERE ABLE TWENTY

01:40:44.938 --> 01:40:47.040
IDENTIFY ONE OF THE USERS AND

01:40:47.107 --> 01:40:48.909
THE VALIDATED THIS BY GOING TO

01:40:48.976 --> 01:40:50.110
THE LADY AND TALKING TORRENT

01:40:50.177 --> 01:40:51.845
SHOWING HER TO SEARCH RECORDS

01:40:51.912 --> 01:40:53.347
AND SHE SAID YES THOSE ARE MINE.

01:40:53.414 --> 01:40:54.815
SO THERE TWO POINTS FROM THIS

01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:55.716
THE FIRST ONE IS THAT

01:40:55.783 --> 01:40:57.551
ADVERSARIES CAN USE DATA THAT'S

01:40:57.618 --> 01:40:59.486
NOT PART OF WHAT YOU RELEASE.

01:40:59.553 --> 01:41:00.988
THE ANONYMIZE THE DATA YOU DO

01:41:01.054 --> 01:41:03.223
RELEASE. AND THE SECOND PART IS

01:41:03.290 --> 01:41:04.625
A LITTLE BIT MORE INTERESTING

01:41:04.691 --> 01:41:06.593
AND WORRISOME NAMELY THAT. EVER

01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:08.362
SINCE THE PEOPLE WHO WERE DOING

01:41:08.429 --> 01:41:10.431
THE DENOMINATION MAY DRAW

01:41:10.497 --> 01:41:11.799
INCORRECT CONCLUSIONS FROM THE

01:41:11.865 --> 01:41:13.801
DATA FOR EXAMPLE THE REPORTERS

01:41:13.867 --> 01:41:15.402
FROM THE TIMES. I DREW THE

01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:16.703
CONCLUSION THAT THIS LADY HAD A

01:41:16.770 --> 01:41:18.305
LOT OF MEDICAL PROBLEMS. TURNED

01:41:18.372 --> 01:41:20.841
OUT SHE DIDN'T SHE WAS A NURSE

01:41:20.908 --> 01:41:22.910
WHO RETIRED NURSE WHO WAS

01:41:22.976 --> 01:41:24.411
SEARCHING THE INTERNET FOR HELP

01:41:24.478 --> 01:41:27.214
FOR. YOUR FRIEND. THE YOU HEARD

01:41:27.281 --> 01:41:28.615
WHAT TIME. TRANSFER DATA

01:41:28.682 --> 01:41:32.986
INCLUDE. AND ALSO- EXAMPLES OF

01:41:33.053 --> 01:41:34.555
ITS UTILITY FOR EXAMPLE HOW

01:41:34.621 --> 01:41:38.125
OFTEN VEHICLES USED HOW TRAFFIC

01:41:38.192 --> 01:41:39.693
PATTERNS WORK THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:41.595
SO TO ANONYMIZE THE DATA

01:41:41.662 --> 01:41:43.297
OBVIOUSLY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:41:43.363 --> 01:41:43.897
TO SUPPRESS THE NAME OF THE

01:41:43.964 --> 01:41:45.599
PERSON BUT YOU ALSO IS POINTED

01:41:45.666 --> 01:41:46.967
OUT HAVE TO SUPPRESS ITS

01:41:47.034 --> 01:41:48.869
RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER PARTS

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:51.104
OF THE DATA. THAT FOR EXAMPLE

01:41:51.171 --> 01:41:52.873
FOR A PICK UP LOCATION AND TIME

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:55.008
OR DROP OFF LOCATION TIME IF I

01:41:55.075 --> 01:41:56.977
CAN CORRELATE THE TWO OF

01:41:57.044 --> 01:41:58.312
ESPECIALLY FOR IN THE PAST AND

01:41:58.378 --> 01:41:59.947
MAY BE ABLE TO GROW WITH THAT

01:42:00.013 --> 01:42:01.348
PERSON LEAVES FOR WHERE THAT

01:42:01.415 --> 01:42:02.850
PERSON WORKS. IF THIS THING

01:42:02.916 --> 01:42:05.819
UNIQUE ABOUT THE RECORD AS WELL

01:42:05.886 --> 01:42:08.288
USE THAT. AND ALSO AS WAS

01:42:08.355 --> 01:42:09.923
POINTED OUT ON THESE

01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:12.493
ASSOCIATIONS MAY NOT BE OBVIOUS

01:42:12.559 --> 01:42:16.330
OF FOR EXAMPLE- MASSACHUSETTS A

01:42:16.396 --> 01:42:19.533
FEW YEARS BACK RELEASED HEAVILY

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:21.068
ANONYMIZED RECORDS MEDICAL DATA

01:42:21.134 --> 01:42:22.436
AMPLE TIME TO SWING HERE

01:42:22.503 --> 01:42:26.106
RESEARCHER AT HARVARD WAS ABLE

01:42:26.173 --> 01:42:26.573
TO IDENTIFY THE RECORD

01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:27.307
BELONGING TO THE GOVERNOR. AND

01:42:27.374 --> 01:42:28.976
THE REASON SHE WAS IT. WAS

01:42:29.042 --> 01:42:30.677
BECAUSE SHE MATCH THE ZIP CODE

01:42:30.744 --> 01:42:32.179
CHEN HIS GENDER AND THE DATE OF

01:42:32.246 --> 01:42:33.814
BIRTH WITH THE RECORDS AND IT

01:42:33.881 --> 01:42:35.349
TURNED OUT HE WAS THE ONLY ONE

01:42:35.415 --> 01:42:37.117
QUICK THOSE THREE QUALITIES. IN

01:42:37.184 --> 01:42:38.051
FACT FROM THOSE THREE YOU CAN

01:42:38.118 --> 01:42:40.654
IDENTIFY 87% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS

01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:41.955
IN THE US ACCORDING TO A TINY

01:42:42.022 --> 01:42:44.691
SWEENEY STANFORD SAYS NO IT'S

01:42:44.758 --> 01:42:50.230
ONLY 63% IS ANOTHER X. EVEN THE

01:42:50.297 --> 01:42:52.399
SO YOU CAN USE WHAT'S CALLED

01:42:52.466 --> 01:42:54.034
PEOPLE EARNING YOUR ARTIFICIAL

01:42:54.101 --> 01:42:55.769
INTELLIGENCE TO FIND A LOT OF

01:42:55.836 --> 01:42:56.837
THESE NON OBVIOUS

01:42:56.904 --> 01:42:59.673
RELATIONSHIPS. ON NOW ANOTHER

01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:01.475
EXAMPLE OF DATA WHICH

01:43:01.542 --> 01:43:04.912
APPARENTLY IS SEPARATE. AND CAN

01:43:04.978 --> 01:43:06.513
BE ANONYMIZED BUT WHEN YOU PUT

01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:08.215
THEM TOGETHER YOU OF TROUBLE

01:43:08.282 --> 01:43:11.118
CAME OUT OF OHIO- IN OHIO THEY

01:43:11.184 --> 01:43:13.387
PUT AN ELECTION THEY HAVE POLL

01:43:13.453 --> 01:43:14.321
BOOKS WHERE THEY RECORD THE

01:43:14.388 --> 01:43:15.856
NAME OF THE PERSON IN THE TIME

01:43:15.923 --> 01:43:17.457
THAT. CAME INTO THE POLICE

01:43:17.524 --> 01:43:18.458
STATION. AT THIS TIME THEY WERE

01:43:18.525 --> 01:43:19.693
USING ELECTRONIC VOTING

01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:21.128
MACHINES WHICH PRINT AT THE

01:43:21.194 --> 01:43:22.396
BOTTOM OF THE CAST BALLOTS A

01:43:22.462 --> 01:43:23.830
TIME STAMP SAYING ONE IT WAS

01:43:23.897 --> 01:43:26.867
CAST. NOW IN OHIO AND I'M SORRY

01:43:26.934 --> 01:43:28.101
I DON'T KNOW THE LEAL TERM BUT

01:43:28.168 --> 01:43:30.571
IN OHIO BOTH OF THOSE AT THIS

01:43:30.637 --> 01:43:31.104
TIME WITH. I THINK PUBLIC

01:43:31.171 --> 01:43:33.407
RECORD. WHEN HIS RESEARCHERS

01:43:33.473 --> 01:43:35.175
WERE ABLE TO GET BOTH OF THEM.

01:43:35.242 --> 01:43:36.209
ONE OF THEM COULD NOT BE THE

01:43:36.276 --> 01:43:37.945
AMOUNT OF MICE. SEPARATELY

01:43:38.011 --> 01:43:39.413
PUTTING TOGETHER MATCH AT THE

01:43:39.479 --> 01:43:41.114
TIME STAMPS AND THEY WERE ABLE

01:43:41.181 --> 01:43:43.050
TO. FIGURE OUT HOW AN AWFUL LOT

01:43:43.116 --> 01:43:45.352
OF PEOPLE VOTED. ARE YOU ALSO

01:43:45.419 --> 01:43:48.922
NEED TO- CONSIDER. THAT IF THE

01:43:48.989 --> 01:43:49.823
DATE IS HELD BY MULTIPLE

01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:51.959
GROUPS. AND THE GROUP'S

01:43:52.025 --> 01:43:53.260
ANONYMIZE THE DATA AND THEN

01:43:53.327 --> 01:43:56.363
RELEASE IT. CAN THE DATA BE PUT

01:43:56.430 --> 01:43:58.832
TOGETHER AND THE COMBINATION OF

01:43:58.899 --> 01:44:01.201
THE DATA STOP THE DATA SETS ON

01:44:01.268 --> 01:44:04.137
BE DO NOT BE DEBT. THE AMOUNT

01:44:04.204 --> 01:44:08.809
CIVIL SORRY. ALSO IF YOU RECENT

01:44:08.875 --> 01:44:11.144
DATA NOW AND LATER ON SOME

01:44:11.211 --> 01:44:13.680
OTHER DATA COMES OUT. THOSE TWO

01:44:13.747 --> 01:44:15.115
SETS SEPARATELY YOU MAY NOT BE

01:44:15.182 --> 01:44:17.017
ABLE TO BE ANONYMIZED THEM PUT

01:44:17.084 --> 01:44:18.485
THEM TOGETHER AND YOU MAY BE

01:44:18.552 --> 01:44:19.453
ABLE TO DO SO YOU HAVE TO LOOK

01:44:19.519 --> 01:44:20.754
THE FUTURE AND WHAT OTHER

01:44:20.821 --> 01:44:22.255
PEOPLE ARE DOING AS WELL AS

01:44:22.322 --> 01:44:24.691
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO-

01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:26.426
THEY'RE BASICALLY THREE WAYS TO

01:44:26.493 --> 01:44:28.028
AND ON MY STATE OF THE FIRST

01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:29.129
ONES TO GENERALIZE IT THAT'S

01:44:29.196 --> 01:44:30.864
WHAT HIP BUT DOES FOR ZIP

01:44:30.931 --> 01:44:33.200
CODES- WITH HIPPIE YOU HAVE TO

01:44:33.266 --> 01:44:34.001
SUPPRESS THE LAST. DIGIT ZIP

01:44:34.067 --> 01:44:37.938
CODE AND IF THE THREE DIGIT

01:44:38.005 --> 01:44:40.874
FATHER THREE DIGIT PREFIX HAS

01:44:40.941 --> 01:44:41.408
LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND

01:44:41.475 --> 01:44:44.611
PEOPLE IN THAT AREA. THE WHOLE

01:44:44.678 --> 01:44:46.246
THING. BUT YOU GENERALIZING ON

01:44:46.313 --> 01:44:47.481
THOSE NUMBERS. YOU ALSO PUT

01:44:47.547 --> 01:44:51.118
DATA THIS IS GETTING. AND SO

01:44:51.184 --> 01:44:52.653
YOU MIGHT FOR. ANDERSON SOME

01:44:52.719 --> 01:44:56.356
RANDOM NUMBER TWO MIRACLE DATA.

01:44:56.423 --> 01:44:57.691
THE WITH THAT IS THATYOU HAVE

01:44:57.758 --> 01:44:58.158
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:44:58.225 --> 01:45:00.527
ANONYMIZED DATA THE ONE THAT'S-

01:45:00.594 --> 01:45:02.996
PER TERM IT'S JUST AS USEFUL AS

01:45:03.063 --> 01:45:04.798
THE D. ANONYMOUS THE REGULAR ON

01:45:04.865 --> 01:45:06.566
AND OUT OF MY STATE. AND THE

01:45:06.633 --> 01:45:08.068
THIRD MESSAGES AGGREGATION

01:45:08.135 --> 01:45:08.735
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE MORE

01:45:08.802 --> 01:45:10.370
INTERESTED IN THE STATE'S SIX

01:45:10.437 --> 01:45:11.104
OF THE DATA SO YOU PUT

01:45:11.171 --> 01:45:13.674
TOGETHER. AND RELEASE THE OILS

01:45:13.740 --> 01:45:15.275
THE CENSUS BUREAU DOES A LOT OF

01:45:15.342 --> 01:45:16.977
THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK IN

01:45:17.044 --> 01:45:19.579
THAT AREA. SO WHAT WE DO WELL

01:45:19.646 --> 01:45:20.147
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS

01:45:20.213 --> 01:45:21.682
PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE OF.

01:45:21.748 --> 01:45:23.016
FIRST YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO

01:45:23.083 --> 01:45:24.718
ACCOUNT THE INFORMATION ITS

01:45:24.785 --> 01:45:26.920
EXTERNAL. TO THE DAILY OR NOT

01:45:26.987 --> 01:45:28.655
I'M ICING. AND THIS USED TO BE

01:45:28.722 --> 01:45:30.424
VERY EASY BECAUSE BEFORE THE

01:45:30.490 --> 01:45:32.159
INTERNET AND THE WEB. YOU HAD

01:45:32.225 --> 01:45:33.193
TO TRAVEL TO PLACES TO GET THIS

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:36.263
DATA. NOW IT'S OFTEN ON THE WEB

01:45:36.329 --> 01:45:37.931
AND YOU CAN PULL IT DOWN. AND

01:45:37.998 --> 01:45:39.266
IT ALSO ANONYMIZING

01:45:39.332 --> 01:45:40.434
SUCCESSFULLY ALSO DEPENDS UPON

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:43.937
WHAT. MAKE WHAT MAY BE A MUST

01:45:44.004 --> 01:45:45.539
BE KEPT SECRET NOW BUT ALSO IN

01:45:45.605 --> 01:45:48.208
THE FUTURE. BECAUSE THE DATA

01:45:48.275 --> 01:45:50.210
MAY NEED TO BE PRESERVED THE

01:45:50.277 --> 01:45:52.212
ANONYMITY OF THE DATA MAY BE

01:45:52.279 --> 01:45:54.047
PRESERVED FOR QUITE SOME TIME.

01:45:54.114 --> 01:45:55.415
YOU ALSO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT

01:45:55.482 --> 01:45:57.017
THE THREATS BOTH ONCE IT WOULD

01:45:57.084 --> 01:45:58.652
COMPROMISE THE HOLDER OF THE

01:45:58.719 --> 01:46:00.854
DATA AND ALSO THE SUBJECT. AND

01:46:00.921 --> 01:46:02.322
SOMETIMES PEOPLE WHO'D BE

01:46:02.389 --> 01:46:04.224
ANONYMIZED DATA RE INTERESTED

01:46:04.291 --> 01:46:05.892
IN THINGS OTHER THAN WHAT YOU

01:46:05.959 --> 01:46:08.095
THINK THEY MIGHT BE OUR OTHER

01:46:08.161 --> 01:46:09.196
THAN WHAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN.

01:51:03.423 --> 01:51:05.125
PROTECTS AGGREGATED DATA TO THE

01:51:05.191 --> 01:51:06.926
EXTENT THAT REVEALING THAT THE

01:51:06.993 --> 01:51:08.728
IT WOULD ALSO REVEAL ELECTRONIC

01:51:08.795 --> 01:51:10.063

01:51:10.130 --> 01:51:11.998
PROTECTED BY CAL APPLE. THIS IS

01:51:12.065 --> 01:51:12.966
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SEEING

ANYTHING IN THE TAXES COLLECTED

01:51:14.401 --> 01:51:16.102

ALSO. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:51:22.742 --> 01:51:23.943
AGGREGATED DATA WERE TALKING

LIKE THAT UNDERLYING DATA WE'RE

01:51:26.713 --> 01:51:28.048
TALKING ABOUT SUMMARIES OF DATA

01:51:29.482 --> 01:51:31.951
COMPILED TO OTHER FORMS SO THAT

01:51:32.018 --> 01:51:33.553
WE BELIEVE THAT CAL ACT.

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:34.854
PROTECTS THE UNDERLING THE

01:51:34.921 --> 01:51:36.289
UNDERLYING DATA DOESN'T

01:52:28.041 --> 01:52:29.042
THAT ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE

01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:31.511
COMPLEX THAN THAT CITIES DO NOT

01:52:31.578 --> 01:52:33.480
HAVE ACCESS TO AT THE MOMENT.

01:52:33.546 --> 01:52:35.415
THE PUBLIC NEEDS TOOLS TO BE

01:52:53.933 --> 01:52:58.471
DISCUSSION. AND IT'S NOT THIS

01:52:58.538 --> 01:53:00.240
IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW WE AS

01:53:00.306 --> 01:53:02.275
A SOCIETY ARE GOING TO STEP

01:53:02.342 --> 01:53:03.943
TOGETHER FORD INTO THESE NEW

01:53:04.010 --> 01:53:05.645
TOOLS AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO

01:53:05.712 --> 01:53:07.981
MANAGE THE PUBLIC GOOD AND

01:53:08.047 --> 01:53:11.584
ALLOW BUSINESSES TO THRIVE. AND

01:53:11.651 --> 01:53:12.452
WE AT THE OPEN MOBILITY

01:53:12.519 --> 01:53:13.653
FOUNDATION ARE SETTING

01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:15.889
OURSELVES UP TO. BE THE FORUM

01:53:15.955 --> 01:53:17.657
IN WHICH THOSE DISCUSSIONS

01:53:17.724 --> 01:53:22.729
HAPPEN AND A FULL OPEN WAY.

01:53:22.795 --> 01:53:24.964
THERE'S ACRIMONY AND THERE'S A

01:53:25.031 --> 01:53:26.766
LOT OF CONTENTION AROUND THIS.

01:53:26.833 --> 01:53:27.300
BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY

01:53:27.367 --> 01:53:29.769
IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT EVEN ONE

01:53:29.836 --> 01:53:31.604
OF OUR MOST STRIDENT CRITICS IS

01:53:31.671 --> 01:53:33.039
ACTUALLY ONE OF OUR MOST ACTIVE

01:53:33.106 --> 01:53:38.444
CONTRIBUTORS. UBER'S JUMP IS

01:53:38.511 --> 01:53:41.080
ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MOST ACTIVE

01:53:41.147 --> 01:53:43.183
CONTRIBUTORS TO OUR ACTUAL CODE

01:53:43.249 --> 01:53:43.716
BASE I THINK THAT'S REALLY

01:53:43.783 --> 01:53:47.921
IMPORTANT ISSUE. THE CAMPUS.

01:53:47.987 --> 01:53:49.022
THE WAY THAT THE RIGHT OF WAY

01:53:49.088 --> 01:53:51.491
HAS BEEN MANAGED- FOR AS LONG

01:53:51.558 --> 01:53:52.759
AS WE'VE KIND OF KNOWN WRITER

01:53:52.825 --> 01:53:54.627
STOP SIGN STREET LIGHTS GOT A

01:53:54.694 --> 01:53:56.396
LITTLE MORE CUTS IF INSTIGATED

01:53:56.462 --> 01:53:57.797
THESE WORKS WHEN WE'RE TRYING

01:53:57.864 --> 01:53:59.832
TO MANAGE INDIVIDUALS AND

01:53:59.899 --> 01:54:02.135
UNSOPHISTICATED BUSINESSES.

01:54:02.202 --> 01:54:02.735
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE DEALING

01:54:02.802 --> 01:54:05.872
WITH ANYMORE. WE NEED NEW

01:54:05.939 --> 01:54:08.541
TOOLS- THAT WORK DIRECTLY WITH

01:54:08.608 --> 01:54:09.876
THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE

01:54:09.943 --> 01:54:12.912
CONTROLLING DEVICES. A STOP

01:54:12.979 --> 01:54:15.315
SIGN IS VISUAL ITEM THE PERSON

01:54:15.381 --> 01:54:16.816
OR I A OUR SYSTEM IS

01:54:16.883 --> 01:54:17.784
CONTROLLING WHAT'S GOING ON

01:54:17.850 --> 01:54:19.786
WITH THAT CAN IMMEDIATELY READ

01:54:19.852 --> 01:54:21.588
THAT AND OPERATE WITHOUT. WE

01:54:21.654 --> 01:54:23.089
NEED NEW TOOLS AS THE PUBLIC

01:54:23.156 --> 01:54:24.524
THAT WORK TOGETHER WITH THE

01:54:24.591 --> 01:54:26.726
BUSINESS SYSTEMS. SO THAT WE

01:54:26.793 --> 01:54:28.761
ARE ABLE TO OPERATE TOGETHER.

01:54:28.828 --> 01:54:31.464
AND TO THAT A FUNDAMENTAL CITY

01:54:31.531 --> 01:54:31.965
LEVEL THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:54:32.031 --> 01:54:36.569
INTERESTED IN. LET'S SEE WE

01:54:36.636 --> 01:54:37.904

EXPRESS PUBLIC- THE PUBLIC GOOD

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:42.742
IN THE WAYS THAT ALGORITHMS CAN

01:54:42.809 --> 01:54:44.944
CONSUME. SO THAT THE ARGUMENTS

01:54:45.011 --> 01:54:47.046
ABOUT THE PATCHWORK OF FIVE

01:54:47.113 --> 01:54:50.049
REGULATIONS STARTS FALLING AWAY.

01:54:50.116 --> 01:54:51.251
IT'S OKAY IF THERE'S DIFFERENT

01:54:51.317 --> 01:54:53.820
REGULATIONS IF WE ARE ABLE TO

01:54:53.886 --> 01:54:55.154
SAY IN EACH JURISDICTION THIS

01:54:55.221 --> 01:54:56.723
IS WHAT IT IS AND THOSE SYSTEMS

01:54:56.789 --> 01:54:58.358
CAN CLEANLY AND EASILY OPERATE

01:54:58.424 --> 01:55:02.562
WITHIN THE. THIS NEW LANGUAGE

01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:06.499

01:55:08.067 --> 01:55:12.171
FIRST SORRY. WE NEED TO CREATE

01:55:12.238 --> 01:55:14.474

01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:16.976
RULES IN A NEW LANGUAGE- TO

01:55:17.043 --> 01:55:18.411
EXPRESS THIS AND BE ABLE TO

01:55:18.478 --> 01:55:20.113
ALLOW- PRIVATE COMPANIES TO

01:55:20.179 --> 01:55:23.683
WORK WITH IT. OVER TIME AND WE

01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:27.353
NEED TO ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN-

01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:31.324
AS THE CONVERSATION PROGRESSES.

01:55:31.391 --> 01:55:34.560
I HAVE ONE PERSON ON MY TEAM

01:55:34.627 --> 01:55:36.329
WHO MANAGES SIX THOUSAND

01:55:36.396 --> 01:55:40.300
SCOOTERS. I ONLY EXPECT THAT

01:55:40.366 --> 01:55:45.405
NUMBER TO INCREASE. I NEED TO

01:55:45.471 --> 01:55:47.040
KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

01:55:47.106 --> 01:55:49.008
THOSE DEVICES SO THAT I CAN

01:55:49.075 --> 01:55:51.110
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE IN

01:55:51.177 --> 01:55:51.711
WHEELCHAIRS CAN GET THROUGH MY

01:55:51.778 --> 01:55:55.682
CITY. SO I CAN MAKE SURE. THAT

01:55:55.748 --> 01:55:58.284

01:55:59.886 --> 01:56:03.156
CONSIDERATION RULES. RIGHT AND

01:56:03.222 --> 01:56:05.258
ONE PERSON HAS TO DO THIS IF I

01:56:05.325 --> 01:56:06.859
DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO DATA

01:56:06.926 --> 01:56:10.129
VERIFIABLE INDIVIDUAL DEVICE

01:56:10.196 --> 01:56:13.099

01:56:27.146 --> 01:56:30.016
TOGETHER WE UNDERSTAND THAT

01:56:30.083 --> 01:56:31.851
PRIVACY IS A CENTRAL COMPONENT

01:56:31.918 --> 01:56:34.787
FOR SUCCESS ON ALL SIDES AND AS

01:56:34.854 --> 01:56:36.989
SUCH- IN OUR OPENING ACTIONS

01:56:37.056 --> 01:56:38.558
FOR OUR FOUNDATION WE SET UP A

01:56:38.624 --> 01:56:40.226
PRIVACY COMMITTEE THAT PRIVACY

01:56:40.293 --> 01:56:41.761

ARE LITTLE MORE CLOSE JUST A

01:56:55.174 --> 01:56:56.309
MEMBERSHIP BUT THIS ONE

01:56:56.376 --> 01:56:58.678
SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF THE-

01:56:58.745 --> 01:57:01.047
THAT WEIGHT. AND IMPORTANCE OF

01:57:01.114 --> 01:57:04.016
THIS- PRICE OF THIS ITEM WE SET

01:57:04.083 --> 01:57:06.252

01:57:13.059 --> 01:57:14.927
COMPLEX FIELD. WE DON'T KNOW

01:57:21.868 --> 01:57:24.804
INCREDIBLY SENSITIVE IMPORTANT.

01:57:24.871 --> 01:57:26.406

01:57:26.472 --> 01:57:28.975
VOICES ON THAT ARE TRYING TO

01:57:29.041 --> 01:57:29.709
GET US TO DO VERY PARTICULAR

01:57:29.776 --> 01:57:33.613

THEY DO A LOT WITH WHAT WE

02:00:29.956 --> 02:00:31.624

REASONS THAT PEOPLE DON'T USE

02:06:24.376 --> 02:06:25.978
MY CREDIBILITY ARE REALLY RUN

02:06:26.045 --> 02:06:27.146
INFRASTRUCTURE THE LACK OF

02:06:27.212 --> 02:06:28.514
INFRASTRUCTURE. COST AND

02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:30.516
AVAILABILITY. AND DATA SHARING

02:06:30.582 --> 02:06:32.084
WITH US CITY PARTNER LIKE SANTA

02:06:32.151 --> 02:06:33.619
MONICA. HELPS IS ACTUALLY

02:06:33.686 --> 02:06:34.687
ACHIEVE THEIR GOAL OF MODE

02:06:34.753 --> 02:06:36.789
SHIFT. SO THAT TO US IS

02:06:36.855 --> 02:06:39.325
ULTIMATELY THE PROMISE OF THIS

02:06:39.391 --> 02:06:41.226
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. WE

02:06:41.293 --> 02:06:41.727
KNOW THAT UNDER CERTAIN

02:06:41.794 --> 02:06:43.429
CIRCUMSTANCES NON AYE RELATED

02:06:43.495 --> 02:06:45.631
DATA CAN POSE PRIVACY CONCERNS

02:06:45.698 --> 02:06:46.098
AND WE THINK THOSE ARE

02:06:46.165 --> 02:06:48.801
LEGITIMATE. WE TAKE THE PRIVACY

02:06:48.867 --> 02:06:50.035
OF WRITER DATA VERY VERY

02:06:50.102 --> 02:06:51.704
SERIOUSLY AND WE INVEST

02:06:51.770 --> 02:06:53.038
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF TIME AND

02:06:53.105 --> 02:06:55.074
MONEY. INTO DATA MANAGEMENT

02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:56.108
INFRASTRUCTURE IN TECHNICAL

02:06:56.175 --> 02:06:58.110
SECURITY. WE RESTRICT WHO CAN

02:06:58.177 --> 02:06:59.545
SEE WHAT DATA INTERNALLY AND WE

02:06:59.611 --> 02:07:01.246
HAVE EXTENSIVE POLICIES ON HOW

02:07:01.313 --> 02:07:03.148
WE SURE IT EXTERNALLY. THESE

02:07:03.215 --> 02:07:04.249
PRIVACY CONCERNS ARE ONLY

02:07:04.316 --> 02:07:05.617
EXACERBATED BY THE UNCLEAR

02:07:05.684 --> 02:07:07.786
PATCHWORK OF LAW AROUND THE

02:07:07.853 --> 02:07:08.387
COUNTRY THAT MANY OTHERS HAVE

02:07:08.454 --> 02:07:10.089
ALREADY REFERRED TO TODAY.

02:07:10.155 --> 02:07:11.357
WE'RE PROUD THAT THE CALIFORNIA

02:07:11.423 --> 02:07:12.691
STATE LEGISLATURE IS ADDRESSING

02:07:12.758 --> 02:07:13.525
THESE ISSUES AND IS LED THE

02:07:13.592 --> 02:07:15.327
NATION PROTECTING THE PRIVACY

02:07:15.394 --> 02:07:16.862
OF ITS CITIZENS. AND APPRECIATE

02:07:16.929 --> 02:07:18.030
THE LEGISLATURE LOOKING TO

02:07:18.097 --> 02:07:19.631
IMPROVE THAT CLARITY OVERTIME.

02:07:19.698 --> 02:07:20.899
A BLUNT APPROACH WOULD BE TO

02:07:20.966 --> 02:07:22.234
TREAT CITIES LIKE WE TREAT ANY

02:07:22.301 --> 02:07:23.435
OTHER DATA PARTNER AND NOT

02:07:23.502 --> 02:07:24.670
SHARE THIS REAL TIME NON I

02:07:24.737 --> 02:07:26.271
AGREE TO DATE WITH THEM. CITIES

02:07:26.338 --> 02:07:27.973
WOULD STILL GET SOME AGGREGATED

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:29.008
DATA FOR RESEARCH IN URBAN

02:07:29.074 --> 02:07:30.609
PLANNING PURPOSES PLUS HAVE THE

02:07:30.676 --> 02:07:32.411
ABILITY TO ENFORCE COMPLIANCE

02:07:32.478 --> 02:07:33.779
WILL GREATLY REDUCING PRIVACY

02:07:33.846 --> 02:07:35.581
RESTS. IT IS IN FACT HOW

02:07:35.647 --> 02:07:38.050
CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING DATA LAWS

02:07:38.117 --> 02:07:39.018
APPLY TO MOST TECH COMPANIES.

02:07:39.084 --> 02:07:40.085
BUT WE ARE A CLEAN

02:07:40.152 --> 02:07:41.587
TRANSPORTATION COMPANY THAT

02:07:41.653 --> 02:07:43.255
USES TECHNOLOGY TO DELIVER A

02:07:43.322 --> 02:07:44.423
CRITICAL SERVICE FOR

02:07:44.490 --> 02:07:46.692
COMMUNITIES MOBILITY. WE THINK

02:07:46.759 --> 02:07:47.860
THE RIGHT PATH HERE IS A BIT

02:07:47.926 --> 02:07:48.994
MORE NUANCE IT'S A MORE

02:07:49.061 --> 02:07:51.163
TARGETED AND FLEXIBLE APPROACH

02:07:51.230 --> 02:07:52.064
ONE THE CONSIDERS IMPORTANCE OF

02:07:52.131 --> 02:07:54.066
LOCAL AUTONOMY AND LEAVES ROOM

02:07:54.133 --> 02:07:55.000
FOR INNOVATION THAT WOULD ALLOW

02:07:55.067 --> 02:07:56.168
CITIES AND TRANSPORTATION

02:07:56.235 --> 02:07:58.137
COMPANIES LIKE US TO BUILD A

02:07:58.203 --> 02:07:59.138
BETTER FUTURE FOR CLEAN

02:07:59.204 --> 02:08:01.240
TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA. WITH

02:08:01.306 --> 02:08:03.175
THE POWER OF THE PUBLIC PRIVATE

02:08:03.242 --> 02:08:03.776
PARTNERSHIP THAT ARE REFERRED

02:08:03.842 --> 02:08:05.677
TO. AND SHOULD THE STATE WANT

02:08:05.744 --> 02:08:07.079
TO TAKE A MORE MEASURED

02:08:07.146 --> 02:08:08.580
APPROACH YOU CAN DO SO BY

02:08:08.647 --> 02:08:09.782
SETTING UP PRINCIPLES IT WANTS

02:08:09.848 --> 02:08:11.850
TO ACHIEVE. FOR EXAMPLE NO

02:08:11.917 --> 02:08:13.252
PERSONS LOCATION HISTORY SHOULD

02:08:13.318 --> 02:08:14.520
BE IDENTIFIABLE FROM ANYTHING

02:08:14.586 --> 02:08:16.555
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. RAW DATA

02:08:16.622 --> 02:08:17.723
SHOULD BE TIGHTLY SECURED WITH

02:08:17.790 --> 02:08:18.924
RESTRICTIONS ON WHO CAN ACCESS

02:08:18.991 --> 02:08:20.526
IT. AND LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:08:20.592 --> 02:08:21.760
SHOULDN'T HAVE ACCESS WITHOUT

02:08:21.827 --> 02:08:23.495
APPROPRIATE LEGAL PROCESS.

02:08:23.562 --> 02:08:25.164
ARMED WITH THOSE PRINCIPLES WE

02:08:25.230 --> 02:08:25.931
BELIEVE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH

02:08:25.998 --> 02:08:27.866
CITIES ACADEMICS AND THE STATE

02:08:27.933 --> 02:08:28.834
TO DEVELOP A SET OF DATA

02:08:28.901 --> 02:08:30.803
SHARING STANDARDS. THAT

02:08:30.869 --> 02:08:32.004
ULTIMATELY CAN EVOLVE AS THE

02:08:32.071 --> 02:08:34.106
SPACE OF BALLS AND APPLY

02:08:34.173 --> 02:08:35.240
EQUALLY TO BOTH TRANSPORTATION

02:08:35.307 --> 02:08:37.709
OPERATORS AND TO CITIES WE

02:08:37.776 --> 02:08:38.277
THINK THAT'S A REALLY REALLY

02:08:38.343 --> 02:08:40.279
CRITICAL COMPONENT. IF YOU WANT

02:08:40.345 --> 02:08:41.313
TO LOOK OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA

02:08:41.380 --> 02:08:42.481
THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES MANY

02:08:42.548 --> 02:08:43.515
CITIES THAT COULD SERVE AS A

02:08:43.582 --> 02:08:44.483
MODEL FOR THIS KIND OF DATA

02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:45.717
SHARING BUT CHICAGO AND I'M

02:08:45.784 --> 02:08:46.685
HAPPY TO SPEAK TO THAT DURING

02:08:46.752 --> 02:08:48.053
QUESTIONING. WE'VE ALSO

02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:50.022
PREPARED SOME HANDOUTS. BUT THE

02:08:50.089 --> 02:08:51.824
BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. RATHER

02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:53.225
THAN DRAWING A BRIGHT LINE INTO

02:08:53.292 --> 02:08:55.294
WHAT CITIES CAN AND CANNOT SEE

02:08:55.360 --> 02:08:57.062
AND RECEIVE. WE SUPPORT

02:08:57.129 --> 02:08:58.897
FOCUSING ON GOVERNANCE.

02:08:58.964 --> 02:09:00.999

BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS

02:09:03.001 --> 02:09:05.137
ALIKE. AT THE END OF THE DAY WE

02:09:05.204 --> 02:09:06.038
DON'T SEE THIS AS AN

02:09:06.105 --> 02:09:08.073
ADVERSARIAL PROCESS. WE BELIEVE

02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:10.909
A PATH FORWARD. IS CLEAR AND IT

02:09:10.976 --> 02:09:11.743
ALLOWS US TO BE TRANSPARENT

STRIPPED OUT. AND SUCH

02:12:53.432 --> 02:12:54.833

02:12:58.136 --> 02:13:00.772
CLEAR SIGNAL TO LOCAL

GOVERNMENTS THAT THEY ARE NOT

02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:02.974
BEYOND THE LAW. AND I WANT TO

02:13:03.041 --> 02:13:05.744
BE VERY CLEAR WE DO NOT THINK

02:13:05.811 --> 02:13:07.713
THE STATE SHOULD BE CUT OFF

02:13:07.779 --> 02:13:09.748
FROM ALL DATA WHATSOEVER NO ONE

02:13:09.815 --> 02:13:11.216
HERE TODAY IS SAYING THAT. WE

02:13:11.283 --> 02:13:13.051
AGREE THAT LOCAL AGENCIES

02:13:13.118 --> 02:13:14.619
SHOULD BE ABLE TO COLLECT SOME

02:13:14.686 --> 02:13:16.054
DATA IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT

02:13:16.121 --> 02:13:18.056
NEW TRANSPORTATION DEVICES ARE

02:13:18.123 --> 02:13:19.925
DEPLOYED SAFELY. EFFICIENTLY

02:13:19.991 --> 02:13:22.794
SUSTAINABLY AND EQUITABLY. BUT

02:13:22.861 --> 02:13:24.429
LOCAL AGENCIES DO NOT NEED TO

02:13:24.496 --> 02:13:26.498
COLLECT INDIVIDUAL FRAUGHT TRIP

02:13:26.565 --> 02:13:28.700
DATA. ABOUT PEOPLE IN ORDER TO

02:13:28.767 --> 02:13:30.502
DO SO THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO

02:13:30.569 --> 02:13:31.403
USE AGGREGATE AND DE IDENTIFIED

02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:33.305
DATA. AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY

02:13:33.372 --> 02:13:34.706
TRUE BECAUSE THE CITIES HAVE

02:13:34.773 --> 02:13:36.174
NOT SHOWN THAT THEY ACTUALLY

02:13:36.241 --> 02:13:38.210
NEED INDIVIDUAL TRIP LATER I

02:13:38.276 --> 02:13:39.578
HAVE THE LUCKY POSITION OF

02:13:39.644 --> 02:13:40.512
BEING THE LAST ONE TO SPEAK

02:13:40.579 --> 02:13:41.513
TODAY WE HAVE NOT HEARD A

02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:43.181
SINGLE. USE CASE THAT WOULD

02:13:43.248 --> 02:13:45.517
NECESSITATE INDIVIDUAL FRAUD

02:13:45.584 --> 02:13:47.185
DATA THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE OF

02:13:47.252 --> 02:13:49.354
THINGS ARE MENTIONED. SUCH AS-

02:13:49.421 --> 02:13:51.323
ENTERING THE VERACITY OF DATA

02:13:51.390 --> 02:13:51.823
THERE ARE TECHNOLOGICAL

02:13:51.890 --> 02:13:54.459
SOLUTIONS THAT SOLVE FOR THIS

02:13:54.526 --> 02:13:56.795
WE ARE A MODERN STATE LET'S USE

02:13:56.862 --> 02:13:58.029
A MODERN TECHNOLOGICAL

02:13:58.096 --> 02:14:00.699
SOLUTIONS IS SOMETHING. THAT

02:14:00.766 --> 02:14:01.266
THAT WOULD BE HAPPY TO TALK

02:14:01.333 --> 02:14:06.138
MORE ABOUT. I HEARD ABOUT. PLAN

02:14:06.204 --> 02:14:07.272
NEEDS IT PEACE BUT ALSO HEARD

02:14:07.339 --> 02:14:07.873
THAT THE KEY THINGS THAT WERE

02:14:07.939 --> 02:14:09.941
LOW FORWARD TO TALKING THAT.

02:14:10.008 --> 02:14:11.109
PATTERNS WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING

02:14:11.176 --> 02:14:12.711
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHERE

02:14:12.778 --> 02:14:14.513
I GO THE KEY IS WHERE MOST

02:14:14.579 --> 02:14:15.747
PEOPLE ARE GOING AND THERE'S

02:14:15.814 --> 02:14:17.048
WAYS TO MAKE SURE THAT CITIES

02:14:17.115 --> 02:14:18.350
HAVE THE DATA THAT THEY NEED.

02:14:18.417 --> 02:14:21.453
AN AGGREGATE WAY- THE OTHER

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:23.288
OTHER. USE CASES THAT WERE

02:14:23.355 --> 02:14:25.357
MENTIONED WERE TRYING TO

02:14:25.424 --> 02:14:26.358
UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE'S

02:14:26.425 --> 02:14:27.626
PREFERENCES ARE BUT IT SEEMS

02:14:27.692 --> 02:14:29.227
FROM. FROM THE TESTIMONY TODAY

02:14:29.294 --> 02:14:30.595
THAT SURVEYS ARE GOING TO BE

02:14:30.662 --> 02:14:32.531
THE MOST WAY THE BEST WAY TO

02:14:32.597 --> 02:14:33.665
GET THAT YOU GET THAT

02:14:33.732 --> 02:14:35.934
INFORMATION- AND THEN ALSO

02:14:36.001 --> 02:14:37.736
ENFORCING SCOOTER CAPS MAKING

02:14:37.803 --> 02:14:38.703
SURE THAT THERE'S NOT TOO MANY

02:14:38.770 --> 02:14:40.872
SCOOTERS IN VENICE BEACH. THAT

02:14:40.939 --> 02:14:42.941
YOU CAN GET WITH- INDIVIDUAL

02:14:43.008 --> 02:14:44.009
LEVEL DATA THAT'S NOT

02:14:44.075 --> 02:14:45.677
PERTAINING TO TRIPS BUT WE'RE

02:14:45.744 --> 02:14:46.578
SCOOTERS ARE PARKING AND WE

02:14:46.645 --> 02:14:48.513
HAVE NO PROBLEM. WITH CITIES

02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:50.282
GETTING ACCESS TO INDIVIDUAL

02:14:50.348 --> 02:14:51.850
DATA WHEN IT'S NOT A TRIP DATA

02:14:51.917 --> 02:14:53.752
SO WHERE SCOOTERS ARE PARKED TO

02:14:53.819 --> 02:14:57.055
ENFORCE PARKING LIMITS. CAPS

02:14:57.122 --> 02:14:58.590
EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION ANYTHING

02:14:58.657 --> 02:15:00.392
LIKE THAT COMPLETELY FINE WITH

02:15:00.459 --> 02:15:02.093
THAT. BUT WHEN CITIES START

02:15:02.160 --> 02:15:02.627
THEM OUT AND I THINK IT'S

02:15:02.694 --> 02:15:03.995
TELLING WITH SACRAMENTO IS

02:15:04.062 --> 02:15:06.131
DOING WITH- WITH AGREEABLE DATA

02:15:06.198 --> 02:15:07.265

THEY'RE DOING WITH AGGREGATE

02:15:14.306 --> 02:15:15.807

TALKING ABOUT SMART CITIES WE

02:15:21.413 --> 02:15:22.314
ARE TALKING ABOUT SURVEILLANCE

02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:24.416
CITY'S. TURNING OUR CITIES INTO

02:15:24.483 --> 02:15:25.851
SURVEILLANCE CITIES IS NOT

02:15:25.917 --> 02:15:27.352
NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE

02:15:27.419 --> 02:15:28.820
LAUDABLE PLANNING GOALS THAT

02:15:28.887 --> 02:15:30.589

A WAY THAT PROTECTS THE PRIVACY

02:15:39.064 --> 02:15:40.866
INTERESTS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS

I JUST HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS-

02:16:11.630 --> 02:16:17.068
ACCEPTING THE PREMISE THAT WE-

02:16:17.135 --> 02:16:21.006

02:16:21.072 --> 02:16:23.341
TO ASSIST US IT SEEMS THAT THE

02:16:23.408 --> 02:16:25.810
QUESTION IS TO WHAT LIMIT WHAT

02:17:02.047 --> 02:17:04.683
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE TO

02:17:04.749 --> 02:17:05.850
BALANCE THIS UNDERSTANDING

02:17:05.917 --> 02:17:09.788
PERHAPS THAT DE AGGREGATING- IS

02:17:09.854 --> 02:17:12.891
THE LAST RESORT. BECAUSE OF A

02:17:12.958 --> 02:17:14.726

02:18:56.327 --> 02:18:58.329
PRACTICE. I HOPE THAT THAT WAS

02:18:58.396 --> 02:18:59.864
THE INTENT OF THESE THREE CITY

02:18:59.931 --> 02:19:01.332
ATTORNEYS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T

02:19:01.399 --> 02:19:04.102
SIT WELL WITH ME. SO WITH THAT

02:19:04.169 --> 02:19:05.603
OF COULD YOU START MISTER OLSON

02:19:05.670 --> 02:19:07.338
VERY BRIEFLY MAYBE A THIRTY

02:19:07.405 --> 02:19:08.840
SECOND JUST TO HELP SORT OF

02:19:08.907 --> 02:19:11.176
GIVE US SOME PARAMETERS. SURE

02:19:11.242 --> 02:19:12.377
THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN FOR

02:19:12.444 --> 02:19:13.545

TEARS FOR INCLUDING US IN THIS

02:19:15.647 --> 02:19:17.782
PANEL- SO I THINK THE WAY THAT

02:19:17.849 --> 02:19:19.317
I WOULD LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM

02:19:19.384 --> 02:19:20.118
AND I WOULD BE CURIOUS ALSO

02:19:20.185 --> 02:19:21.886
ABOUT- DOCTOR BISHOPS

02:19:21.953 --> 02:19:22.987
RECOMMENDATIONS HERE BUT I

02:19:23.054 --> 02:19:24.055
THINK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT

02:19:24.122 --> 02:19:25.690
DIMENSIONS. THAT WE YOU KNOW

02:19:25.757 --> 02:19:26.925
THAT WE LOOK AT THE DATA SO

02:19:26.991 --> 02:19:27.959
THINGS LIKE THE RETENTION

02:19:28.026 --> 02:19:29.928
PERIOD HOW LONG IS THE DATA

02:19:29.994 --> 02:19:31.362
RETAINED BY THE GROUP THAT'S

02:19:31.429 --> 02:19:32.497
CONSUMING IT A RECEIVING IT

02:19:32.564 --> 02:19:33.898
RIGHT. I ALSO THINK ABOUT

02:19:33.965 --> 02:19:35.433
THINGS LIKE ACCESS CONTROL SO

02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:37.268
WHO HAS ACCESS AND WHAT ARE THE

02:19:37.335 --> 02:19:38.203
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF

02:19:38.269 --> 02:19:39.838
THOSE INDIVIDUALS. THIS ALL

02:19:39.904 --> 02:19:41.039
BOILS DOWN TO A THEME THAT

02:19:41.106 --> 02:19:44.676
YOU'VE HEARD FROM MANY MANY

02:19:44.743 --> 02:19:46.578
IDENTIFYING USE CASES. IF WE GO

02:19:46.644 --> 02:19:47.579
BACK TO OTHER DIMENSIONS THE

02:19:47.645 --> 02:19:50.515
MATTER GRANULARITY OF THE DATA

02:19:50.582 --> 02:19:53.017
OR THE LEVEL OF AGGREGATION

02:19:53.084 --> 02:19:55.186
THAT SUPPLY IS ALL WRITTEN ICAL.

02:19:55.253 --> 02:20:01.226
I BISHOP. TO OKAY. SORRY SO

02:20:01.292 --> 02:20:03.194
THINGS WELL. I'M ASIAN LEVELS

02:20:03.261 --> 02:20:03.762
AS WELL AS OTHER TECH. THAT

02:20:03.828 --> 02:20:05.263
HAVE. YOU KNOW REMARK ON BY A-

02:20:05.330 --> 02:20:06.064
MEMBERS OF THIS PANEL. THE

02:20:06.131 --> 02:20:06.798
OTHER PANEL. OUR EGGS. THE

02:20:06.865 --> 02:20:08.233
TECHNIQUES ONE WOULD USE. TO

02:20:08.299 --> 02:20:10.402
PROTECT. IN THESE CASES.

02:20:10.468 --> 02:20:11.836
FRANKLY WE'VE PREPARED A NUMBER

02:20:11.903 --> 02:20:14.139
OF HAND OUTS AND WE FINDS THAT.

02:20:14.205 --> 02:20:16.174
TO DATE SIX PRINCIPLES AND THEN

02:20:16.241 --> 02:20:18.977
THREE. PRACTICES AND- ALL ALL

02:20:19.043 --> 02:20:20.645
REITERATE WHAT I SAID DURING MY

02:20:20.712 --> 02:20:22.213
TESTIMONY- THIS DOESN'T NEED TO

02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:24.048
BE ADVERSARIAL PROCESS I THINK

02:20:24.115 --> 02:20:25.617
ACTUALLY EVERYONE HERE WOULD

02:20:25.683 --> 02:20:26.451
APPRECIATE. YOU KNOW THE

02:20:26.518 --> 02:20:27.485
APPROPRIATE LEGISLATION

02:20:27.552 --> 02:20:30.088
ENACTED- THE KEY ISSUES REALLY

02:20:30.155 --> 02:20:31.956
DO SURROUND THOSE. DIMENSIONS

02:20:32.023 --> 02:20:33.525
AND PROP THERE ARE SOME OTHER

02:20:33.591 --> 02:20:35.460
KEY TO ME. AS WELL SO IF YOU'D

02:20:35.527 --> 02:20:36.494
MAKE SURE IF WE HAVEN'T.

02:20:36.561 --> 02:20:38.163
RECEIVED ASSEMBLY GET THIS

02:20:38.229 --> 02:20:41.032
THAT. ABSENT ANYONE ELSE WISH

02:20:41.099 --> 02:20:45.436
TO COMMENT. BUT RESUMES YEAH

02:20:45.503 --> 02:20:46.771
I'LL I MEAN I'LL JUST IT WHEN

02:20:46.838 --> 02:20:48.740
IT TO DATA WHICH WE- HAVE A LAW

02:20:48.807 --> 02:20:49.874
THAT PROTECTS THE STATE A IT'S

02:20:49.941 --> 02:20:51.576
CAL ACT. AND I THINK WE COULD

02:20:51.643 --> 02:20:52.710
HAVE ANOTHER WE AND WE ANOTHER

02:20:52.777 --> 02:20:55.113
LAW LIMITING AS I SAID CITIES

02:20:55.180 --> 02:20:56.181
TO AGGREGATE AND DE IDENTIFIED

02:20:56.247 --> 02:20:58.716
DATA WOULD. SEND A CLEAR SIGNAL

02:20:58.783 --> 02:21:00.084
TO THE CITY IS THAT THAT WAS

02:21:00.151 --> 02:21:01.686
THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATOR

02:21:01.753 --> 02:21:03.721
AND THE STATE IS OFF LIMITS TO

02:21:03.788 --> 02:21:06.524
YOU FOR THE- AND THERE'S A IF

02:21:06.591 --> 02:21:08.126
YOU WANT IT THERE'S CERTAIN

02:21:08.193 --> 02:21:09.594
PROCESSES THAT OUT AND COLLECT

02:21:09.661 --> 02:21:11.129
BUT- YOU CAN GET. IS A SUBPOENA

02:21:11.196 --> 02:21:17.001
PERCENT EXISTING LAW. AT. WHAT

02:21:17.068 --> 02:21:17.635
THAT'S THE LAW THE PERTHE

02:21:17.702 --> 02:21:20.805
STATE I WENT COMES. AGGREGATE

02:21:20.872 --> 02:21:23.908
DATA I THINK A LAW THAT.

02:21:23.975 --> 02:21:25.643
BROADLY LIMIT CITIES TO THE

02:21:25.710 --> 02:21:26.578
MOST SENSITIVE DATA AND THEN

02:21:26.644 --> 02:21:28.680
ALLOWS THEM WITHIN THAT TO WORK

02:21:28.746 --> 02:21:29.848
WITH WHATEVER DAY THAT THEY

02:21:29.914 --> 02:21:32.383
MIGHT WANT TO ASK FOR- I THINK

02:21:32.450 --> 02:21:34.652
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD WAY OF

02:21:34.719 --> 02:21:36.354
ALLOWING INNOVATION WILL ALSO

02:21:36.421 --> 02:21:38.022
PROTECTING PRIVACY THANK YOU.

02:21:38.089 --> 02:21:42.627
ANY OTHER COMMENTS. MR MINU. I

02:21:42.694 --> 02:21:43.995
WORKING THERE WE GO YEAH OUR

02:21:44.062 --> 02:21:45.063
FIRST STORY VERY MUCH FOR THE

02:21:45.129 --> 02:21:46.598
LETTER COMING IN SO LATE- THAT

02:21:46.664 --> 02:21:48.900
IS A SNAFU IN TERMS OF GETTING

02:21:48.967 --> 02:21:50.802
SIGNATURES FROM VARIOUS

02:21:50.869 --> 02:21:51.703
ATTORNEYS TOGETHER IT WAS

02:21:51.769 --> 02:21:53.071
CERTAINLY NOT MEANT IN ANY WAY

02:21:53.137 --> 02:21:54.372
WE DID NOT EXPECT YOU TO BE

02:21:54.439 --> 02:21:55.640
ABLE TO RESPOND TO IT SO

02:21:55.707 --> 02:21:57.775
QUICKLY. I CAN SPEAK TO THAT IN

02:21:57.842 --> 02:21:59.611
A SECOND BUT- WE ALSO BELIEVE

02:21:59.677 --> 02:22:03.882
THE ENUMERATED USES- DIRECTION

02:22:03.948 --> 02:22:06.217
IS GOOD. I DON'T THINK IT THE

02:22:06.284 --> 02:22:07.585
OTHER SIDE OF THAT WHICH IS

02:22:07.652 --> 02:22:09.320
CLOSE DOWN ACCESS TO

02:22:09.387 --> 02:22:11.256
DISAGGREGATED DATA IS GOOD ALSO

02:22:11.322 --> 02:22:12.223
I THINK THAT THAT IT'S

02:22:12.290 --> 02:22:14.492
PRECLUDING. THE ABILITY- TO

02:22:14.559 --> 02:22:16.527
POTENTIALLY A FOR SOME VERY

02:22:16.594 --> 02:22:19.497
GOOD POTENTIAL USES- WE DO NEED

02:22:19.564 --> 02:22:20.832
A SEGREGATED. ALREADY IN TERMS

02:22:20.899 --> 02:22:24.569
OF THAT REST STATE FOR DEVICES-

02:22:24.636 --> 02:22:26.371
WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. VERIFY

02:22:26.437 --> 02:22:28.539
THAT. NAM AND WE CAN'T DO IT

02:22:28.606 --> 02:22:31.609
WITHOUT THAT- ALSO. LIKE WE

02:22:31.676 --> 02:22:33.311
ALSO WANT ROUTE DATA

02:22:33.378 --> 02:22:34.078
DISAGGREGATED TO BE ABLE TO

02:22:34.145 --> 02:22:37.181
MEASURE- SERVICE LEVELS IN.

02:22:37.248 --> 02:22:39.017
INCOME AREAS- WHERE WE HAD A

02:22:39.083 --> 02:22:41.452
LOWER POINT WE ALSO. WANT

02:22:41.519 --> 02:22:44.222
MEASURE WHERE WRITERS PREFER-

02:22:44.289 --> 02:22:47.792
TO GO- SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE

02:22:47.859 --> 02:22:50.929
WE'RE- WE'RE STANDING- UP WHERE

02:22:50.995 --> 02:22:51.496
WE SHOULD. BE PAYING A NEW.

02:22:51.562 --> 02:22:53.398
STRUCTURE NOW. THE ABOUT THAT

02:22:53.464 --> 02:22:56.567
VARIOUS. BAG IN THE SECOND. IN

02:22:56.634 --> 02:22:58.569
THAT. I DON'T THINK IT'S A VERY

02:22:58.636 --> 02:23:04.175
CLEAN. I THINK THERE'S A. STRAY

02:23:04.242 --> 02:23:05.276
IN AND STRONG WAS TO SAY WE

02:23:05.343 --> 02:23:05.944
DON'T WANT THIS DISAGGREGATED A

02:23:06.010 --> 02:23:08.112
OUT THERE. MY GUNS IN BUT IT'S

02:23:08.179 --> 02:23:09.881
A VERY REASONABLE POSITION TO

02:23:09.948 --> 02:23:11.316
TAKE BUT I THINK WHEN WE REALLY

02:23:11.382 --> 02:23:12.283
LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO

02:23:12.350 --> 02:23:14.052
WITH THIS DATA. TAKING AWAY

02:23:14.118 --> 02:23:16.020
THAT ABILITY IS GOING TO HARM

02:23:16.087 --> 02:23:18.856
THE PUBLIC GOOD WE NEED TO BE

02:23:18.923 --> 02:23:19.390
ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

02:23:19.457 --> 02:23:20.892
HAPPENING AND WE NEED TO BE

02:23:20.959 --> 02:23:22.360
ABLE TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT

02:23:22.427 --> 02:23:24.595
HAPPENED AS WELL AS AS THINGS

02:23:24.662 --> 02:23:25.163
ARE COMING AS I WAS SAYING

02:23:25.229 --> 02:23:26.564
EARLIER WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:23:26.631 --> 02:23:27.665
START WORKING WITH THE

02:23:27.732 --> 02:23:29.033
COMPANIES THEY'RE PROVIDING

02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:31.703
SERVICE- AND THOSE SERVICES

02:23:31.769 --> 02:23:33.271
WILL BE DONE IN DISAGGREGATED

02:23:33.338 --> 02:23:34.839
FORM. AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

02:23:34.906 --> 02:23:37.775
OPERATE WITHOUT. THANK YOU ANY

02:23:37.842 --> 02:23:40.044
OTHER THOUGHTS. PART OF MISTER

02:23:40.111 --> 02:23:42.213
MISS WARRANT THANK YOU CHAIR I

02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:43.915
THINK THERE ARE. A THEIR DID

02:23:43.982 --> 02:23:44.782
THERE'S A NEED FOR AN

02:23:44.849 --> 02:23:45.483
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT DATA

02:23:45.550 --> 02:23:47.285
NEEDS AGGREGATED VERSUS NOT

02:23:47.352 --> 02:23:49.087
WHAT'S NOT FOR EXAMPLE IS RAMS

02:23:49.153 --> 02:23:50.955
IS TALKED ABOUT. DEVICES THAT

02:23:51.022 --> 02:23:53.157
ARE PART NOT MOVING NOW I PARTY

02:23:53.224 --> 02:23:54.892
DEVICE BUT IT IS DEPLOYED OR IT

02:23:54.959 --> 02:23:56.861
IS PARKED DOES NOT NEED TO BE

02:23:56.928 --> 02:23:58.463
AGREED IT'S NOT RELATED TO A

02:23:58.529 --> 02:23:59.497
PERSON. AND THAT'S HOW WE

02:23:59.564 --> 02:24:01.199
COLLECT DATA ON REQUIRE.

02:24:01.265 --> 02:24:02.867
PERCENT OF OUR DEVICES GO TO

02:24:02.934 --> 02:24:04.635
OUR LOW INCOME AREAS OR THAT

02:24:04.702 --> 02:24:05.770
THEY ARE DEPLOYED TO TRANSIT

02:24:05.837 --> 02:24:08.539
LOCATIONS OR- ALMOST. FIVE

02:24:08.606 --> 02:24:09.374
HUNDRED PRICES AND THEY

02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:10.375
ACTUALLY HAVE A THOUSAND

02:24:10.441 --> 02:24:11.609
DEVICES THT SORT OF PERMISSION

02:24:11.676 --> 02:24:12.844
DOES NOT NEED TO BE ACCURATE IS

02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:14.212
NOT RELATED TO A TRIP AND I

02:24:14.278 --> 02:24:15.113
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

02:24:15.179 --> 02:24:18.416
US. AS STEWARDS OF THEIR WAY TO

02:24:18.483 --> 02:24:20.985
IT THAT. WHEN A QUICKLY

02:24:21.052 --> 02:24:22.587
CLARIFIED I'D SAY. AFTER DID I

02:24:22.653 --> 02:24:23.755
AM AN AGGREGATE TRIPPED NOT ALL

02:24:23.821 --> 02:24:26.190
DATA. AND I MEAN I THINK I

02:24:26.257 --> 02:24:27.291
THINK ALSO I THINK IT'S VERY

02:24:27.358 --> 02:24:28.893
IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THESE

02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:29.894
BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD BE

02:24:29.961 --> 02:24:31.396
POTENTIALLY USEFUL TO. TO FORCE

02:24:31.462 --> 02:24:32.864
EVERY CALIFORNIAN TO WEAR.

02:24:32.930 --> 02:24:34.665
ANKLE MONITOR TO MAKE SURE WE

02:24:34.732 --> 02:24:35.600
COULD SEE WHERE THEY WENT AT

02:24:35.666 --> 02:24:36.901
ALL TIMES. BUT THERE HAVE TO BE

02:24:36.968 --> 02:24:38.469
LIMITS. DATA THAT WE GET ABOUT

02:24:38.536 --> 02:24:40.538
WHERE PEOPLE ARE GOING- AND I

02:24:40.605 --> 02:24:42.273
MEAN. IT'S NOT ONLY ME SAYING

02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:43.641
THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAS

02:24:43.708 --> 02:24:44.876
RECOGNIZED THAT LOCATION DATE

02:24:44.942 --> 02:24:46.544
IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE DATA THIS.

02:24:46.611 --> 02:24:48.513
RAISES SERIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL

02:24:48.579 --> 02:24:49.814
QUESTIONS WHEN CITIES ARE

02:24:49.881 --> 02:24:53.117
FORCING- OPERATORS TO TURN OVER

02:24:53.184 --> 02:24:54.819
ACCESS TO THE STATE A ANSEL.

02:24:54.886 --> 02:24:56.154
REASONABLE LIMITS THAT WOULD

02:24:56.220 --> 02:24:58.623
ALLOW THEM TO PLAN FOR THE

02:24:58.689 --> 02:25:00.291
BENEFIT OF ALL OF US WHILE ALSO

02:25:00.358 --> 02:25:02.393
PROTECTING OUR PRIVACY SINCE.

02:25:02.460 --> 02:25:03.294
SINCE ALL THIS IS SUPPOSED TO

02:25:03.361 --> 02:25:05.129
BE THE BENEFIT OF CALIFORNIANS.

02:25:05.196 --> 02:25:06.397
THAT'S THAT IS THE APPROPRIATE

02:25:06.464 --> 02:25:08.066
BALANCING TEST AND THAT IS THE

02:25:08.132 --> 02:25:09.167
ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE THANK

02:25:09.233 --> 02:25:11.069
YOU. I COULD DO YOU HAVE A

02:25:11.135 --> 02:25:16.574
QUESTION I DO HAVE. MORE YEAH.

02:25:16.641 --> 02:25:18.376
YOU HAVE ONE QUESTION AGAIN. IN

02:25:18.443 --> 02:25:20.611
YOU DON'T HAS HAVE TO. CONSENT

02:25:20.678 --> 02:25:23.614
KNOWLEDGE. SHOULD A WRITER OF

02:25:23.681 --> 02:25:25.583
ONE OF THESE VEHICLES KNOW THAT

02:25:25.650 --> 02:25:27.218
THEIR INFORMATION IS BEING

02:25:27.285 --> 02:25:30.521
TRACKED OR- OBTAINED WHILE THEY
