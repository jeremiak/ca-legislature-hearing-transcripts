HEART OF SILICON VALLEY- WE-

00:23:40.218 --> 00:23:41.753
EARLY ON AGAIN WATCHING THE

THERE. I THINK OUR OVERALL

00:23:59.738 --> 00:24:03.408
APPROACH IS REALLY THREE FOLD-

00:24:03.475 --> 00:24:05.410
ONE TO PREVENT- INTRODUCTION

00:24:05.477 --> 00:24:08.613
OF- OF KOBE INTO LONG TERM CARE

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.582
FACILITIES AND INTO A VERY

00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:13.318
VULNERABLE POPULATION. I TO

00:24:13.385 --> 00:24:15.453
EARLY DETECTION- SO THAT WE CAN

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.889
PICK UP A PROBLEM EARLY AND

00:24:17.956 --> 00:24:19.658
THREE. OF COURSE IS

00:24:19.724 --> 00:24:21.293
CONTAINMENT- SO THAT WE CAN GET

00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:22.627
AN OUTBREAK UNDER CONTROL AS

00:24:22.694 --> 00:24:24.629
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AFTER WE

00:24:24.696 --> 00:24:27.365
DETECT IT- OUR WORK ACTUALLY

00:24:27.432 --> 00:24:30.335
STARTED- IN IN EARLY MARCH WE

00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:32.604
WERE FORTUNATE IN THAT WE HAD-

00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:34.606
COLLEAGUES FROM THE CENTERS FOR

DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:37.409
DEPLOYED TO THE COUNTY THIS WAS

00:24:37.475 --> 00:24:39.211
BECAUSE WE WERE ONE OF THE

00:24:39.277 --> 00:24:41.012
FIRST COUNTIES IN THE STATE- TO

00:24:41.079 --> 00:24:44.015

TO REVIEW EACH FACILITIES AND

00:24:57.195 --> 00:24:59.364
FACTION PREVENTION POLICY AND

00:24:59.431 --> 00:25:01.399

00:25:01.466 --> 00:25:05.303
GUIDANCE- MOST OF THE WORK HAS

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:08.039
BEEN- WE'VE REALLY HAD TO

00:25:08.106 --> 00:25:10.809
CREATE AN ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:11.676
IN OUR EMERGENCY OPERATIONS

00:25:11.743 --> 00:25:14.379

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.409
THEY BE RESIDENTS VISITORS ARE

00:31:18.476 --> 00:31:20.011
CARE GIVERS. COULD ACTUALLY

00:31:20.078 --> 00:31:20.745
THAT THEY COULD BE A

00:31:20.812 --> 00:31:22.680
SYMPTOMATIC BUT COULD BE STILL

00:31:22.747 --> 00:31:24.282
SPREADING THE VIRUS WITHOUT

00:31:24.349 --> 00:31:27.952
SHOWING ANY SIGNS. OF THAT THAT

00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:29.687
HAS BEEN A PART PROBLEM. WELL

00:31:29.754 --> 00:31:31.723
INTO THE- JUST CHARGE FROM THE

00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:33.691
HOSPITALRESIDENTS JUST FROM

00:31:33.758 --> 00:31:35.026
THE HOSPITAL STAFF COMING IN

00:31:35.093 --> 00:31:37.295
OUR VISITORS COMING- THEY WERE

00:31:37.362 --> 00:31:38.963
SPREADING THE VIRUS BEFORE WE

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:40.665
KNEW THAT THAT WAS POSSIBLE-

00:31:40.732 --> 00:31:43.067
AND SHOWING NO SIGN NUMBER

00:31:43.134 --> 00:31:45.703
THREE. AND THAT'S WHEN I CAN'T

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:47.739
EMPHASIZE ENOUGH OF FROM THE

00:31:47.805 --> 00:31:49.274
GET GO THERE HAS BEEN

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:50.875
INADEQUATE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE

00:31:50.942 --> 00:31:53.077
EQUIPMENT WE KNOW NOW THAT.

00:31:53.144 --> 00:31:54.445
PARTICULAR KINDS OF EQUIPMENT

00:31:54.512 --> 00:31:56.314
ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO AVOID THE

00:31:56.381 --> 00:31:59.484
SPREAD OF CODE. UNFORTUNATELY

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:01.352
NO ONE HAVE THAT EQUIPMENT THE

00:32:01.419 --> 00:32:02.253
SUPPLY CHAINS WERE NOT

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.922
AVAILABLE- FACILITIES DIDN'T

00:32:04.989 --> 00:32:05.490
HAVE IT THE COUNTIES DIDN'T

00:32:05.556 --> 00:32:07.125
HAVE IT AND NO ONE REALLY HAD

00:32:07.191 --> 00:32:08.793
IT AND THAT WAS A IT'S BEEN A

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:10.595
PARTICULAR PROBLEM- I NOTICED

00:32:10.662 --> 00:32:14.098
IN YOUR IN YOUR- COMMITTEE ROB

00:32:14.165 --> 00:32:16.801
WORK THAT WAS SOME NOTES. TAKE

00:32:16.868 --> 00:32:19.804
NOTATE ABOUT MAKES HOME PP BUT

00:32:19.871 --> 00:32:20.672
THE REASON THAT WAS IT WILL

00:32:20.738 --> 00:32:23.141
AVAIL ADEQUATE PP WASN'T

00:32:23.207 --> 00:32:24.509
AVAILABLE THAT WAS MOST

00:32:24.575 --> 00:32:27.245
IMPORTANT TO AVOID THE SPREAD.

00:32:27.312 --> 00:32:29.113
I OR I WOULD MENTION YOU AND

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:31.015
ALSO IS VERY. THERE HAS BEEN

00:32:31.082 --> 00:32:32.784
ADDED IN ADEQUATE TESTING

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.419
TESTING HAS RAMPED UP VERY

00:32:34.485 --> 00:32:36.020
NICELY MORE RECENTLY. THE

00:32:36.087 --> 00:32:37.922
TESTING WAS NOT AVAILABLE AT

00:32:37.989 --> 00:32:39.924
THE BEGINNING OF THIS PANDEMIC

00:32:39.991 --> 00:32:41.092
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU REALLY NEED

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:43.094
IT AT A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS

00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:45.163
YOU NEED TESTING- IS O

00:32:45.229 --> 00:32:48.599
CRITICAL- AND AT TO BE ABLE TO

00:32:48.666 --> 00:32:50.568
KNOW WHO IS POSITIVE AND

00:32:50.635 --> 00:32:53.137
ESPECIALLY THEN AFTER. THAT WE

00:32:53.204 --> 00:32:55.540
CAN BE SPREADING THE DISEASE-

00:32:55.606 --> 00:32:57.208
BUT THAT WAS NOT REALLY RATTLED

00:32:57.275 --> 00:32:59.177
TESTING WAS NOT READILY

00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:01.279
AVAILABLE UNTIL FAIRLY RECENTLY.

00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:02.413
AND UP FIVE AND I'M I CAN'T

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.615
EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH. AT THE

00:33:04.682 --> 00:33:06.451
BEGINNING OF THIS PANDEMIC THE

00:33:06.517 --> 00:33:08.052
FOCUS AND THE EMPHASIS WAS

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:10.154
REALLY ON OUR HOSPITALS.

00:33:10.221 --> 00:33:12.390
UNDERSTANDABLY SO THERE WAS A I

00:33:12.457 --> 00:33:14.125
THOUGHT THE AT THAT POINT THE

00:33:14.192 --> 00:33:14.926
MODELING WAS SHOWING WE MIGHT

00:33:14.992 --> 00:33:16.527
NEED FORTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL

00:33:16.594 --> 00:33:17.829
HOSPITAL BEDS BEYOND WHAT WE

00:33:17.895 --> 00:33:20.331
HAD. AND THE EMPHASIS AND FOCUS

00:33:20.398 --> 00:33:21.966
WAS NOT ON SKILLED NURSING

00:33:22.033 --> 00:33:24.369
FACILITIES IT CAME LATER. AB

00:33:24.435 --> 00:33:26.771
PRIORITY WAS PROVIDE INITIALLY

00:33:26.838 --> 00:33:28.973
FOR PP AND FOR AYE TESTING WAS

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.075
IN THE HOSPITALS NOT AT NOT ON

00:33:31.142 --> 00:33:33.044
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT

00:33:33.111 --> 00:33:35.446
HAS RESULTED DâN BY THE TIME

00:33:35.513 --> 00:33:37.281
THE FOCUS DID TURN TO SKILLED

00:33:37.348 --> 00:33:39.283
NURSING IT WAS ALMOST TOO LATE

00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:40.451
THE DISEASE THAT ARE ENTERED

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:42.053
THE FACILITIES. AND IT WAS

00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:44.222
SPREADING TO PLAY. IN ADDITION

00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:46.991
I WOULD SAY TO BECAUSE OF THE

00:33:47.058 --> 00:33:49.827
BECAUSE OF THE- EMPHASIS THERE

00:33:49.894 --> 00:33:50.962
WERE CONFLICTS WAS CONFLICTING

00:33:51.028 --> 00:33:54.198
STANDARDS AND FLIPPING. THAT I

00:33:54.265 --> 00:33:56.134
THINK THAT HAVE EVERYWHERE APRS

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.001
GUIDANCE FROM FROM THE FEDERAL.

00:33:57.068 --> 00:33:58.569
GUIDE FROM THE STAY GUIDES FROM

00:33:58.636 --> 00:34:00.371
THE COUNTIES AND DIFFERENT

00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:02.006
DIFFERENT GUIDANCE IN DIFFERENT

00:34:02.073 --> 00:34:04.108
PLACES. SO THAT I THINK REALLY

00:34:04.175 --> 00:34:05.910
REALLY HINDERED ARE SITUATION

00:34:05.977 --> 00:34:07.945
ALL THE WAY AROUND. LET ME TURN

00:34:08.012 --> 00:34:09.614
TO WHAT IS NEEDED NOW WHAT'S

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.616

COLLABORATION COMMUNICATION AND

00:34:22.093 --> 00:34:24.028
CONSISTENCY BETWEEN-

LOCAL VARIATION WE SEE- AGAIN

00:34:40.211 --> 00:34:42.013
TESTING IS SO WEIRD WE ARE NOW

00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:45.716

SCARED ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED. WE

IN NURSING HOMES HAS BEEN

00:36:28.486 --> 00:36:30.688
AVOIDABLE. WE HAVE HAD DECADES

CARE BUT TO TAKE PROFITS FUNDED

00:38:06.283 --> 00:38:08.352
BY TAXPAYERS. INCREDIBLY

00:38:08.419 --> 00:38:10.488
PROVIDING GOOD CARE IS NOT A

00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:12.757
LINE PROFITABILITY. THIS IS NOT

00:38:12.823 --> 00:38:15.593

LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THERE

00:51:06.463 --> 00:51:08.965
WAS A LACK OF TESTING A LACK OF

00:51:09.032 --> 00:51:12.536
PPVS. AND AS A RESULT WE SAW A

00:51:12.602 --> 00:51:14.404

HAVE IMPROVED ACCESS TO P. B.

00:51:35.492 --> 00:51:37.060
EASE WE ARE UNDERSTAND A LITTLE

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:39.863
BIT BETTER ABOUT. WHAT HOW THIS

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:41.598
VIRUS TRANSMITS IN THE A

00:51:41.665 --> 00:51:43.867
SYMPTOMATIC NATURE THAT MAKES A

00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:45.735

00:53:01.912 --> 00:53:03.513
ROLE OF ASYMPTOMATIC

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:06.283
TRANSMISSION- THAT IS MORE

00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:07.250
IMPORTANT FOR AB THAT THAN

00:53:07.317 --> 00:53:08.718
EVER. I ALSO JUST WANT TO

00:53:08.785 --> 00:53:10.887
HIGHLIGHT AGAIN DIE MANY OF THE

00:53:10.954 --> 00:53:13.156
STAFF WHO AT LEAST WORK AND

00:53:13.223 --> 00:53:14.958
SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND

00:53:15.025 --> 00:53:18.862
OUR JURISDICTION- J. ARE AMONG.

00:53:18.929 --> 00:53:21.932
LOW WAGE WORKERS THEY COME FROM

00:53:21.998 --> 00:53:23.667
COMMUNITIES WHERE WE'RE SEEING

00:53:23.733 --> 00:53:26.102
A LOT OF TRANSMISSION OF COAL

00:53:26.169 --> 00:53:28.738
BED. AND SO IT IS CRITICALLY

00:53:28.805 --> 00:53:32.042
IMPORTANT THAT THEY BE- TESTED

00:53:32.108 --> 00:53:33.944
FREQUENTLY THAT WE REMOVE

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:36.880
BARRIERS TO TESTING- SO THAT

00:53:36.947 --> 00:53:38.648
THEY CAN DO THEIR WORK AND

00:53:38.715 --> 00:53:41.351
PROTECT BOTH THEMSELVES AND THE

00:53:41.418 --> 00:53:42.686
RESIDENTS THAT THEY CARE FOR SO

00:53:42.752 --> 00:53:47.157
I THINK- THE REALLY IMPORTANT

00:53:47.223 --> 00:53:48.592
COLOR. PREVENT THAT AND OF

00:53:48.658 --> 00:53:52.562
COURSE. ADEQUATE P. P. AS WELL-

00:53:52.629 --> 00:53:54.464
SO THOSE ARE THE LAYERS OF THE

00:53:54.531 --> 00:53:55.699
LAYERS OF PROTECTION BUT I

00:53:55.765 --> 00:53:57.734
THINK OUR I HAVE BEEN A REALLY

00:53:57.801 --> 00:54:01.304
PROTECT- THE RESIDENTS OF BEST-

00:54:01.371 --> 00:54:03.373
AS BEST WE CAN SO THANK YOU SO

SENATOR JACKSON AYE I DID OKAY

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.281
THE OTHER QUESTION GOES MORE TO

00:54:11.348 --> 00:54:14.651
THE FINAL TWO SPEAKERS MISTER

00:54:14.718 --> 00:54:17.253
CORNET AND- MISTER CHECK COULD

00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:20.090

AND IN MY EXPERIENCE ACTUALLY

00:54:25.061 --> 00:54:26.930
TRYING TO. ADDRESS SOME OF THE-

00:54:26.997 --> 00:54:28.632
PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:54:28.698 --> 00:54:30.867
NURSING HOMES AND NURSING CARE-

00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:33.003
WE HAVE A SORT OF A STRUCTURAL

00:54:33.069 --> 00:54:34.738
PROBLEM AND AS WAS MENTIONED

00:54:34.804 --> 00:54:39.709
THAT. THE PAYMENT AND THE CARE

00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:41.411
ARE ALMOST OF OPPOSITE.

00:54:41.478 --> 00:54:44.247
CONCERNS OF THESE FACILITIES

00:54:44.314 --> 00:54:46.116
GET MORE MONEY FOR NEW PATIENTS

00:54:46.182 --> 00:54:47.317
THAN THEY DO FOR THE ONES THEY

00:54:47.384 --> 00:54:49.686
ARE AND THE US OF COURSE IN THE

00:54:49.753 --> 00:54:51.087
COVERT SHOULD SHOULD CONTEXT OF

00:54:51.154 --> 00:54:53.957
THE POTENTIAL FOR BRINGING IN

00:54:54.024 --> 00:54:55.859
COVERT POSITIVE PATIENTS IS A

00:54:55.925 --> 00:54:58.461
AN INDUCEMENT- AND OF COURSE

00:54:58.528 --> 00:55:00.897
WITH URSING HOMES IN GENERAL-

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:02.766
I AGREE THAT FOR DECADES WE

00:55:02.832 --> 00:55:04.868
HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY

00:55:04.934 --> 00:55:07.604
LAPSE. IN OUR PROTECTION ALL OF

00:55:07.671 --> 00:55:09.305
OUR MOST VULNERABLE OF

00:55:09.372 --> 00:55:11.107
POPULATION BEING OUR SENIORS

00:55:11.174 --> 00:55:12.809
AND THOSE WHO HAVE HEALTH

00:55:12.876 --> 00:55:15.545
ISSUES- I'M WONDERING IF YOU

00:55:15.612 --> 00:55:16.846
EITHER OF YOU HAVE A

00:55:16.913 --> 00:55:19.683
SUGGESTION. AS TO HOW WE

00:55:19.749 --> 00:55:22.652
LITERALLY CHANGE A SYSTEM THAT

00:55:22.719 --> 00:55:24.988
HAS UNDERFUNDED THESE HOPE

00:55:25.055 --> 00:55:27.123
HOMES MOST OF WHICH ARE FOR

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:28.324
PROFIT AND THEY WANT TO MAKE

00:55:28.391 --> 00:55:30.393
MONEY THAT'S THEIR PRIMARY AND-

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:31.661
FREQUENTLY THEIR EXCLUSIVE

00:55:31.728 --> 00:55:34.464
GOAL- AS PROFIT MAKING END OF

00:55:34.531 --> 00:55:36.299
ENTERPRISES. THE ROLE OF

00:55:36.366 --> 00:55:37.500
GOVERNMENT OF COURSE IS TO

00:55:37.567 --> 00:55:39.102
REGULATE AND PROTECT AGAINST

00:55:39.169 --> 00:55:41.104
ABUSES IN THEIR PROCESS. AND

00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:42.405
I'M WONDERING IF EITHER OR BOTH

00:55:42.472 --> 00:55:44.174
OF THEM HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:46.342
POSITIVE SUGGESTIONS THAT WE

00:55:46.409 --> 00:55:48.078
COULD AND SHOULD CONSIDER TO

00:55:48.144 --> 00:55:49.946
REALLY TRY TO TURN THIS AROUND

00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:52.282
IN THE IN THE COVERT IN POST

00:55:52.348 --> 00:55:54.117
COVERT WORLD AHEAD. THANK YOU

00:55:54.184 --> 00:55:55.485
SENATOR JACKSON I THINK THAT

00:55:55.552 --> 00:55:57.921
WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS A TONY

00:55:57.987 --> 00:56:02.425
CHICKEN TELL AND CREEK CORNET.

00:56:02.492 --> 00:56:05.829
TONY YEAH THANK YOU FOR YOUR

00:56:05.895 --> 00:56:08.531
QUESTION SENATOR JACKSON'S THIS

00:56:08.598 --> 00:56:09.332
KIND OF GETS RIGHT AT THE HEART

00:56:09.399 --> 00:56:10.567
OF WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE

00:56:10.633 --> 00:56:12.435
LAST TWENTY YEARS I'M THINKING

00:56:12.502 --> 00:56:15.338
ABOUT LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO

00:56:15.405 --> 00:56:17.040
THESE VERY SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS.

00:56:17.107 --> 00:56:18.775
I'M I THINK I WOULD RECOMMEND

00:56:18.842 --> 00:56:22.212
TWO THINGS ONE. I THINK OUR

00:56:22.278 --> 00:56:22.712
LAWS OR REGULATIONS ARE

00:56:22.779 --> 00:56:24.347
ACTUALLY PRETTY DARN GOOD IN

00:56:24.414 --> 00:56:26.216
CALIFORNIA. THEY'RE VERY

00:56:26.282 --> 00:56:27.817
PROTECTIVE OF RESIDENTS AND

00:56:27.884 --> 00:56:30.787
THEY ESTABLISH I THINK A- GOOD.

00:56:30.854 --> 00:56:33.356
MINIMUM STANDARD OF CARE.

00:56:33.423 --> 00:56:33.823
PROBLEM IS ALWAYS BEEN

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:35.725
ENFORCEMENT. PERSON AS I

00:56:35.792 --> 00:56:37.360
MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY HAS

00:56:37.427 --> 00:56:39.496
BEEN LAX FOR DECADES IT'S BEEN

00:56:39.562 --> 00:56:41.731
TOLERANCE OF VIOLATIONS OF MEAN

00:56:41.798 --> 00:56:42.932
EVERY ALMOST EVERY FACILITY IN

00:56:42.999 --> 00:56:46.136
THE STATE HAS MULTIPLE

00:56:46.202 --> 00:56:47.337
VIOLATIONS ANYTIME IT'S- JUST.

00:56:47.403 --> 00:56:49.205
IT JUST BOUNCES ALONG CONTINUE

00:56:49.272 --> 00:56:52.008
THAT WAY- THE FAILURES ARE NOT

00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:53.076
CORRECTED IN THE LONG RUN SO I

00:56:53.143 --> 00:56:55.378
THINK. A SIGNIFICANT FOCUSED

00:56:55.445 --> 00:56:57.781
ON. GOOD AFFECTED ENFORCEMENT

00:56:57.847 --> 00:56:59.315
THAT NOT ONLY INCLUDES A

00:56:59.382 --> 00:57:00.250
REGULATORS BUT AS I MENTIONED

00:57:00.316 --> 00:57:02.352
MY TESTIMONY THE RESIDENTS. OF

00:57:02.418 --> 00:57:03.686
THE RESIDENTS MORE POWER TO

00:57:03.753 --> 00:57:05.555
ENFORCE THE STANDARDS OF. THE

00:57:05.622 --> 00:57:07.690
PIE BUT THEY LIVE UNDER-

00:57:07.757 --> 00:57:09.592
DIRECTLY RATHER THAN RELYING ON

00:57:09.659 --> 00:57:12.328
OTHER PEOPLE TO DO BEFORE THE%

00:57:12.395 --> 00:57:14.164
OUTSOURCING. NEVER SAY EVEN

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:15.532
MAYBE A LONG TERM. IS TO BRING

00:57:15.598 --> 00:57:18.468
THE- VOICE IN THE PRESIDENT X.

00:57:18.535 --> 00:57:20.970
INTO THE VALUATION OF THE CARE

00:57:21.037 --> 00:57:23.473
THAT'S GIVEN- RIGHT NOW.

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:24.340
RESIDENTS GENERALLY DON'T OR

00:57:24.407 --> 00:57:26.242
THEY PAY VERY LITTLE FOR THEIR

00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:28.244
OWN CAN'T IT'S MOSTLY

00:57:28.311 --> 00:57:29.579
GOVERNMENT FUNDED BY TAXPAYERS.

00:57:29.646 --> 00:57:30.713
AND SO THERE'S THIS MIDDLE

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:34.417
PERSON IN THE WAY BETWEEN. THE

00:57:34.484 --> 00:57:36.119
RECEIPT OF CARE AND THE PAYMENT

00:57:36.186 --> 00:57:38.188
FOR CARE. AND SO THE GOVERNMENT

00:57:38.254 --> 00:57:40.056
PAYS FOR CARE SORT OF BLINDLY

00:57:40.123 --> 00:57:41.491
NOT KNOWING WHETHER THE CARE

00:57:41.558 --> 00:57:42.559
THAT WAS DELIVERED BECAUSE THEY

00:57:42.625 --> 00:57:44.661
ARE NOT. IN THE RESIDENTS WHO

00:57:44.727 --> 00:57:47.730
REALLY IN THE FAMILIES KNOW

00:57:47.797 --> 00:57:49.866
WITH. THEY ARE NOT LOOKING HAVE

00:57:49.933 --> 00:57:52.402
A STAKE IN AND HOW. OF THE

00:57:52.468 --> 00:57:53.503
PERFORMANCES REWARDED. WRITING

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:54.470
ALIGNING THE REST EXPERIENCE

00:57:54.537 --> 00:57:56.840
MORE WITH THE PAYMENT SYSTEM IS

00:57:56.906 --> 00:58:00.810
SHOULD BE A PRIORITY. THANK YOU

00:58:00.877 --> 00:58:03.313

FOR A C. P. H. HIGH I MADE

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.637
REFERENCE TO THE FALL I THINK

01:14:01.703 --> 01:14:02.571
CONCERNS ABOUT KNOWING

01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:05.707
CORONAVIRUS A SLEW OF BOTH

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:07.643
COMPETING FOR HOSPITAL BEDS.

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:09.545
OURS USUAL FLU VACCINATION RATE

01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:11.180
IN THE COMMUNITY IN A TYPICAL

01:14:11.246 --> 01:14:13.081
FLU SEASON SOMEWHERE AROUND 45%

01:14:13.148 --> 01:14:14.650
TO HEALTHY PEOPLE TWENTY TWENTY

01:14:14.716 --> 01:14:16.919
GOALS SEVENTY PERCENT- THOSE

01:14:16.985 --> 01:14:19.154
HOSPITAL BEDS- THAT WOULD BE

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:20.556
SAVED BY REDUCE INCREASING

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:22.491
ORGANIZATION RATES WOULD BE

01:14:22.558 --> 01:14:25.294
VERY USEFUL- TO. IF NECESSARY

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.261
TO CARE FOR CORONAVIRUS VICTIM

01:14:26.328 --> 01:14:29.031
SO. WHAT IS CITY PH DOING TO

01:14:29.097 --> 01:14:30.999

AS WELL JUST LIKE RUN A VIRUS.

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:40.642
SO BY INCREASING OUR COMMUNITY

01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:42.311
FLU VACCINATION RATE WE CAN

01:14:42.377 --> 01:14:44.079
HELP SAVE LIVES IN A NURSING

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:45.247

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:49.418
VACCINATION RATE FROM 40% TO

01:14:49.484 --> 01:14:51.053

01:15:00.562 --> 01:15:02.097
45% WE'RE GONNA HAVE SHORTAGE

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:03.298
IS TRYING TO HIT THE SEVENTY

01:15:03.365 --> 01:15:04.833
FIRST. AT THAT POINT TIME SO

IMPORTANCE OF A FLU SHOT- BUT

01:17:55.537 --> 01:17:57.005

HEALTH CARE SERVICES TWO WEEKS

01:23:48.757 --> 01:23:52.927
AGO- OUTLINED A NEW PUZZLE BUT

01:23:52.994 --> 01:23:54.162
THEY'RE LOOKING INTO HEIDI

FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:27.695
SHOULD BE IN A SKILLED NURSING

01:24:27.762 --> 01:24:29.697
FACILITY BY ANY STRETCH. OF THE

01:24:29.764 --> 01:24:30.899
FOLKS WHO COME TO OUR

01:24:30.965 --> 01:24:32.534

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.402
THEY HELP THE THAT HAS CHANGED

01:24:34.469 --> 01:24:37.472
OVER TIME. MORE AND MORE-

01:24:37.539 --> 01:24:39.574
PEOPLE ARE STAYINGHOME LONGER.

01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:40.842
AND WHEN THEY GET TO SKILLED

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:42.177
NURSING FACILITIES THEY TEND TO

01:24:42.243 --> 01:24:43.845
BE MUCH OLDER AND MUCH MORE

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:45.780
FRAIL. THAT HAS ALSO BEEN ONE

01:24:45.847 --> 01:24:47.182
OF THE REAL PROBLEMS WE FOUND

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:48.883
IN KOBE IT IS BY THE TIME THEY

01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:50.685

MUCH OLDER THAN THEY WERE

01:24:53.988 --> 01:24:55.790
MAYBE. TEN OR TWENTY YEARS AGO.

01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:59.727

LITTLE OVER FORTY THAT STILL

FIRST PERHAPS BY JUNE TENTH.

01:29:07.208 --> 01:29:08.276
AND THAT THE FIRST THREE

01:29:08.342 --> 01:29:09.377
ELEMENTS ARE PROBABLY

01:29:09.444 --> 01:29:13.681
FUNDAMENTAL TO INSURING- THAT

01:29:13.748 --> 01:29:15.817
THE INFECTION RATE IN OUR SNAPS

01:29:15.883 --> 01:29:17.185

01:29:17.251 --> 01:29:18.920
VULNERABLE WITH MOST FACILITIES

01:29:18.986 --> 01:29:20.788
ARE PROTECTED. BUT AS

01:29:20.855 --> 01:29:22.590
IMPORTANTLY THE STAFF AND LET

01:29:22.657 --> 01:29:24.125
ME SHARE WITH YOU A VERY QUICK

01:29:24.192 --> 01:29:25.493
A SITUATION THAT HAPPENED TO A

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:29.230
CONSTITUENT OF MINE A FAMILY

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:32.734
MEMBER WHO IS A STAFFER ON TRNA

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:36.437
A IN A- YOU KNOW WE CAN. AT THE

YOUNG AGE OF FONG IN EARLY

01:29:38.773 --> 01:29:40.174
THIRTY. WITH ELEVEN OLD AT HOME

01:29:40.241 --> 01:29:41.876

ALLOWED TO WEAR A P. P. E. THAT

01:29:47.482 --> 01:29:49.183

01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:51.319
IT WOULD BE FRIGHTENING. TO

CERTAINLY VISITORS THAT WERE

STILL ALLOWED AT THAT TIME. SO

01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:58.159
THERE'S A TIMING ISSUE HERE AND

01:29:58.226 --> 01:29:59.160
I'M CERTAINLY VERY AWARE OF

01:29:59.227 --> 01:30:00.762

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.835
THE HOT SPOTS WERE NOT

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:09.537
NECESSARILY TO FIND AT THAT

01:30:09.604 --> 01:30:11.139
TIME. BUT GOING FORWARD WE'VE

01:30:11.205 --> 01:30:13.241
LEARNED AND THAT CERTAINLY THE

01:30:13.307 --> 01:30:15.843
GENESIS OF THE SIX ELEMENTS.

01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:18.513
BUT TO HAVE FORTY WHO ARE SHORT

01:30:18.579 --> 01:30:20.548

VERY FACILITIES WERE A LOT.

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:27.622

THE ISSUES THAT YOU MENTIONED.

01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:07.221
THE ISSUES OF TESTING HAVE BEEN

01:32:07.288 --> 01:32:10.625
EXTRAORDINARY- I CAN SEE

01:32:10.691 --> 01:32:12.193
EVERYONE KNOWS THE NATIONAL

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:14.962
CHALLENGES THAT WERE FACED I

01:32:15.029 --> 01:32:15.496
BRIEFLY MENTIONED IN MY

01:32:15.563 --> 01:32:18.432
COMMENTS. THERE WERE EXTREMELY

01:32:18.499 --> 01:32:20.835
EFFORTS MADE BY OUR BOARD. AND

01:32:20.902 --> 01:32:22.870
ALSO BY THE MAYOR LA CITY TO

01:32:22.937 --> 01:32:24.839
DEVELOP TESTING CAPACITY HERE

01:32:24.906 --> 01:32:27.108
IN LA COUNTY- THEY INVESTED A

01:32:27.174 --> 01:32:28.809
LOT OF MONEY UP FRONT TO

01:32:28.876 --> 01:32:30.978
CONTRACT OR WORK WITH LOCAL

01:32:31.045 --> 01:32:32.780
LABORATORIES. SO THAT WE

01:32:32.847 --> 01:32:34.115
WEREN'T RELIANCE ON THE

01:32:34.181 --> 01:32:35.650
NATIONAL SUPPLIER ON SOME OF

01:32:35.716 --> 01:32:38.586
THE NATIONAL LABORATORIES AND

01:32:38.653 --> 01:32:40.288
HAD HUGE AROUND. SO IN A

01:32:40.354 --> 01:32:41.822
RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME

01:32:41.889 --> 01:32:43.291
WE WERE ABLE TO GET OUR TESTING

01:32:43.357 --> 01:32:45.559
UP THROUGH THOSE- CAPACITIES

01:32:45.626 --> 01:32:48.129
INTO THE THOUSANDS PER DAY.

01:32:48.195 --> 01:32:49.463
WHICH WOULD WHICH PUT US AHEAD

01:32:49.530 --> 01:32:51.132
OF A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS AND

01:32:51.198 --> 01:32:53.868
ONCE WE SAW THAT. MELODY AND WE

01:32:53.935 --> 01:32:55.236
UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:32:55.303 --> 01:32:57.672
TESTING AS A KEY TOOL AND

01:32:57.738 --> 01:32:59.507
ASSURING SAETY AND NURSING

01:32:59.573 --> 01:33:02.076
HOMES- WE DISCARDED THE TAP IN

01:33:02.143 --> 01:33:03.844
THE BACK. AND THAT WAY WE RAN

01:33:03.911 --> 01:33:05.246
INTO A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES OF

01:33:05.313 --> 01:33:06.347
LIKE WHO'S GOING TO DO THE

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:08.182
REGISTRATION WHAT STAFF AND DO

01:33:08.249 --> 01:33:09.850
IT HOW DO WE MOVE IT. HOW DO WE

01:33:09.917 --> 01:33:11.485
GET THE RESULTS BACK AND CENTER

01:33:11.552 --> 01:33:13.554
THE JUST THE LOGISTICS. OF

01:33:13.621 --> 01:33:15.289
DEPLOYING AVAILABLE TEST INTO

01:33:15.356 --> 01:33:16.891
THESE NURSING FACILITIES TO

01:33:16.958 --> 01:33:18.793
SOMETHING NEVER DONE BEFORE. I

01:33:18.859 --> 01:33:20.494
FEEL LIKE WE REALLY HAVE GOT

01:33:20.561 --> 01:33:22.163
GOT THAT DONE WELL. I WILL

01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:23.998
POINT OUT THAT THE REQUIREMENTS

01:33:24.065 --> 01:33:26.133
SET BY THE STATEFOR THE

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:29.570
BASELINE TESTING IS. JUNE THIRD

01:33:29.637 --> 01:33:30.771
THERE WAS A AND I FELT IT WAS

01:33:30.838 --> 01:33:31.973
PUT OUT FEW WEEKS AGO THAT SAID

01:33:32.039 --> 01:33:33.074
THEY HAVE TO COMPLETE THIS

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:34.608
BASELINE TESTING AND THEN GOING

01:33:34.675 --> 01:33:36.944
SURVEILLANCE THERE WASN'T A DAY

01:33:37.011 --> 01:33:38.446
BUT LATER THE STATE CLARIFY IT

01:33:38.512 --> 01:33:40.181
WAS JUNE THIRTIETH BASED ON THE

01:33:40.247 --> 01:33:42.083
ORIGINAL GUIDANCE. A WE SET A

01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:43.951
GOAL TO COMPLETE THAT BASELINE

FRIDAY. IN TERMS OF THE FORTY

01:33:52.526 --> 01:33:56.630

01:33:56.697 --> 01:33:57.264
THOSE DONE WITHIN A WEEK WE MAY

01:33:57.331 --> 01:33:57.865
ACTUALLY HAVE ALMOST ALL OF

01:33:57.932 --> 01:33:59.934

01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:04.405
BETTER THAN OUR JUNE NINETEENTH

01:34:04.472 --> 01:34:05.706
DEADLINE WILL CERTAINLY BE

01:34:05.773 --> 01:34:09.677
DONE. THE STATE DEADLINE-

01:34:09.744 --> 01:34:11.078
HOWEVER YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD

01:34:11.145 --> 01:34:12.880
WE'VE BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY I

01:34:12.947 --> 01:34:13.914
WOULD SAY SUCCESSFUL AND GET

01:34:13.981 --> 01:34:15.149
MEETING THAT I WISH WE COULD

01:34:15.216 --> 01:34:16.050
HAVE DONE EARLIER THE

01:34:16.117 --> 01:34:17.418
CHALLENGES WERE HAUNTING WE

01:34:17.485 --> 01:34:20.121
WORK OUT A SOLUTION. I WOULD

01:34:20.187 --> 01:34:21.789
IMAGINE MANY OTHER COUNTY IS A

01:34:21.856 --> 01:34:23.457
REALLY CHALLENGE WE DO HAVE

01:34:23.524 --> 01:34:24.892
SOME RESOURCES WE'VE-

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:26.994
REASSIGNED STAFF AS WE CAN.

01:34:27.061 --> 01:34:28.896
WE'VE GOT. YOU KNOW TEAMS THAT

01:34:28.963 --> 01:34:30.498
GO OUT TODAY I'VE GOT OVER

01:34:30.564 --> 01:34:32.533
EIGHT. FACILITIES THAT WERE

01:34:32.600 --> 01:34:34.435
CASTING AND WE'RE HAVING STAFF.

01:34:34.502 --> 01:34:36.470
IT'S A VERY I LIVE A RESOURCE

01:34:36.537 --> 01:34:37.905
INTENSIVE PROCESS TO GET THAT

01:34:37.972 --> 01:34:38.906
DONE I IMAGINE A LOT OF

01:34:38.973 --> 01:34:40.841
JURISDICTIONS DON'T HAVE THAT

01:34:40.908 --> 01:34:42.810
AVAILABLE. SO IT WOULD BE GOOD

01:34:42.877 --> 01:34:45.413
TO START TO LOOK AT HOW A

01:34:45.479 --> 01:34:48.149
SUPPORT CAN BE PROVIDED- TO

01:34:48.215 --> 01:34:50.217
MEET THAT NEED. AND I AND I SO

01:34:50.284 --> 01:34:52.219
I COMMENTED IT HAS. BEEN

01:34:52.286 --> 01:34:53.421
NOTICEABLE AT THE NUMBER OF

01:34:53.487 --> 01:34:54.855
DEATHS HAVE GONE DOWN I DO

01:34:54.922 --> 01:34:56.457
THINK THAT THE THREE MAIN

01:34:56.524 --> 01:34:57.224
THINGS THAT MADE THE

01:34:57.291 --> 01:34:59.193
DIFFERENCE. SOURCE CONTROL THAT

01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:00.327
EVERYBODY IN THE FACILITY THE

01:35:00.394 --> 01:35:02.430
MORNING A MASK OR RESPIRATOR.

01:35:02.496 --> 01:35:04.098
SECOND OF ALL THE TESTING.

01:35:04.165 --> 01:35:05.633
INFORM WHO NEEDS TO BE COLD

01:35:05.699 --> 01:35:07.134
HEARTED SO WE'VE GOT THE

01:35:07.201 --> 01:35:08.736
INFECTED PEOPLE HERE THE- THE

01:35:08.803 --> 01:35:10.704
EXPOSED HERE. AND PEOPLE THAT

01:35:10.771 --> 01:35:11.806
HAVE BEEN EITHER INFECTED OR

01:35:11.872 --> 01:35:13.040
EXPOSED SOMEWHERE ELSE NEW

01:35:13.107 --> 01:35:15.076
PEOPLE SHOULD GO INTO A

01:35:15.142 --> 01:35:16.477
QUARANTINE UNTIL WE'RE SURE

01:35:16.544 --> 01:35:18.145
THAT THEY ALL OF THOSE RISKS.

01:35:18.212 --> 01:35:20.381
AND THEN- THE THIRD ELEMENT IS

01:35:20.448 --> 01:35:21.949
UP. IS THAT ISOLATION

01:35:22.016 --> 01:35:23.684
QUARANTINE BUT IF WE DO THOSE

01:35:23.751 --> 01:35:26.587
WELL. THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT

01:35:26.654 --> 01:35:27.755
THAT THE CASES ARE REALLY

01:35:27.822 --> 01:35:32.893
DROPPING EXTRAORDINARILY. THE

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:33.894
ISSUE OF WORKER. LIKE YOU SAID

FISCAL. AND THEY WANT TO BE

WELL EDUCATED THEY WANT

01:35:39.633 --> 01:35:41.268
UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A SYSTEM IN

01:35:41.335 --> 01:35:42.903
PLACE IS GOING TO PROTECT THEM

01:35:42.970 --> 01:35:44.305
THE PEOPLE THERE CARING FOR.

01:35:44.371 --> 01:35:45.306
AND THAT THEY'VE GOT THE

01:35:45.372 --> 01:35:46.540
ADEQUATE RESOURCES PARTICULARLY

01:35:46.607 --> 01:35:49.677
THE BP. TO SAFEGUARD THEMSELVES

01:35:49.743 --> 01:35:51.512
I FEEL WE ARE QUICKLY MOVING IN

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:53.047
THE DIRECTION OF THAT ONE TWO

01:35:55.516 --> 01:35:57.485
CRITICAL STEPS. AND I WILL

01:35:57.551 --> 01:35:58.652
HOPEFULLY BE IN A MUCH BETTER

01:35:58.719 --> 01:36:03.457

COORDINATION THAT THIS CORONA

01:41:33.887 --> 01:41:37.291
VIRUS HAS. FIRST ASSAULT TO

01:41:37.357 --> 01:41:39.793
UNDERGO. ON BECAUSE THE STATE

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:42.029
TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION LIVES

01:41:42.095 --> 01:41:43.730
WERE SAVED AND I WANT TO SAY

01:41:43.797 --> 01:41:45.799
THAT BECAUSE SOME OF THE- SOME

01:41:45.866 --> 01:41:47.301
OF THE QUESTION SEEMS AS IF

01:41:47.367 --> 01:41:49.503
THEIR CRITICISM. BUT I REALLY

01:41:49.570 --> 01:41:51.638
WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK

01:41:51.705 --> 01:41:52.739
THAT'S BEEN DONE DURING THIS

01:41:52.806 --> 01:41:54.241
PERIOD OF TIME DURING A VERY

01:41:54.308 --> 01:41:56.877
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. AND KNOW

01:41:56.944 --> 01:41:58.612
THAT I THINK THAT WE ARE GOING

01:41:58.679 --> 01:41:59.813
TO HAVE SOME VERY VERY

01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:01.648
IMPORTANT LESSONS LEARNED THAT

01:42:01.715 --> 01:42:02.449
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO TAKE

01:42:02.516 --> 01:42:04.485
INTO THE FUTURE. SO HOPEFULLY

01:42:04.551 --> 01:42:06.787
WE'RE KEEPING TRACK OF THOSE-

01:42:06.854 --> 01:42:09.323
ONE OF THEM WHICH REALLY HAS

01:42:09.389 --> 01:42:10.123
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS HEARING

01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:11.124
EXCEPT FOR THAT I'VE BEEN

01:42:11.191 --> 01:42:12.893
HEARING FROM MY CONSTITUENTS

01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:14.461
OVER AND OVER AGAIN ABOUT THE

01:42:14.528 --> 01:42:16.296
LACK OF TESTING AND THE LACK OF

01:42:16.363 --> 01:42:19.800
PP. I REPRESENT A RURAL

01:42:19.867 --> 01:42:21.835
DISTRICT BOB GRAHAM FROM THE

01:42:21.902 --> 01:42:23.904
CENTRAL VALLEY OVER TO THE

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:27.941
SALINAS VALLEY. AND PEOPLE ARE

01:42:28.008 --> 01:42:28.575
SCARED AND I THINK THAT'S BEEN

01:42:28.642 --> 01:42:31.345
ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE WORK ARE.

01:42:31.411 --> 01:42:36.283
AND I THINK WE. TROLL ARE OWN

01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:37.351
FUTURE WHICH IS TO FIGURE A

01:42:37.417 --> 01:42:38.051
WEEK PRODUCE OUR OWN P. HERE

01:42:38.118 --> 01:42:40.320
THE STATE WOULD BE GREAT A BUT

01:42:40.387 --> 01:42:41.989
SUCH FOR THE CONVERSATION

01:42:42.055 --> 01:42:44.258
THERE'S TWO ISSUES THAT. THAT I

01:42:44.324 --> 01:42:46.660
WANT TO ASK ABOUT AND I THINK

01:42:46.727 --> 01:42:48.061
IT MAY HAVE BEEN OUT ANSWERED

01:42:48.128 --> 01:42:50.797
SO I'LL I'LL I'LL DO REAL QUICK

01:42:50.864 --> 01:42:52.199
AND- REALLY WITH THE PUBLIC.

01:42:52.266 --> 01:42:53.967
WANTS TO KNOW IS FAR THEIR

01:42:54.034 --> 01:42:56.036
LOVED ONE SAFE. AND SO THE MORE

01:42:56.103 --> 01:42:58.005
TRANSPARENCY AND THE MORE THAT

01:42:58.071 --> 01:42:59.806
WE CAN BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT

01:42:59.873 --> 01:43:01.742
WE'RE DOING TO KEEP THEIR- THE

01:43:01.808 --> 01:43:04.077
MEMBER OF THE FAMILY THAT HE

01:43:04.144 --> 01:43:05.779
IS. IN THE FACILITY SAFE I

01:43:05.846 --> 01:43:07.147
THINK THAT'S GOING TO THAT'S

01:43:07.214 --> 01:43:08.015
GOING TO BE REALLY REALLY

01:43:08.081 --> 01:43:10.517
IMPORTANT. AND BY THE SAME

01:43:10.584 --> 01:43:13.253
TOKEN- I UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:15.856
ISOLATE AND AT TO RESTRICT WHO

01:43:15.923 --> 01:43:17.457
GOES INTO THE FACILITIES. BUT

01:43:17.524 --> 01:43:19.893
IT- IT IT'S BACK I GUESS THE

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:22.763
QUESTION IS- UNDER WHAT SOME

01:43:22.829 --> 01:43:24.631
CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD IT BE SAFE

01:43:24.698 --> 01:43:26.700
TO ALTER THAT PARTICULAR

01:43:26.767 --> 01:43:29.570
RESTRICTION TO ALLOW. ON A

01:43:29.636 --> 01:43:31.772
FAMILY MEMBER TO VISIT. USING

01:43:31.838 --> 01:43:34.508
GOOD SCIENCE- BECAUSE WHAT WE

01:43:34.575 --> 01:43:36.910
KNOW IS THAT MANY OF THE-

01:43:36.977 --> 01:43:39.580
RESIDENTS ARE FRAGILE. AND THEY

01:43:39.646 --> 01:43:41.715
DEPEND ON FAMILY MEMBERS TO

01:43:41.782 --> 01:43:44.117
COME IN AND MAKE THEIR DAY. OUT

01:43:44.184 --> 01:43:45.152
MUCH MORE MANAGEABLE AND THE

01:43:45.218 --> 01:43:46.720
STAFF DOES TOO AND SO I'M

01:43:46.787 --> 01:43:48.722
WONDERING IF THERE IF SOME

01:43:48.789 --> 01:43:52.459
THOUGHT BEEN GIVEN TO. WHAT

01:43:52.526 --> 01:43:54.595
KIND OF CHANGES MIGHT MY HELP.

01:43:54.661 --> 01:43:56.830
THAT STEM BECAUSE WE HEARD SUCH

01:43:56.897 --> 01:43:59.166
A XIN WERE. HAVING MEMBERS WELL

01:43:59.232 --> 01:44:00.367
I CAN TELL YOU. THAT THE

01:44:00.434 --> 01:44:02.336
SENIORS THAT I KNOW ARE

01:44:02.402 --> 01:44:04.004
CONCERNED ABOUT AND HAVE BEEN

01:44:04.071 --> 01:44:09.876
SO. WHERE NO CAN VISIT. AND

01:44:09.943 --> 01:44:12.279
SEPARATED THE FAN. THANK YOU

01:44:12.346 --> 01:44:13.113
AND I HAD QUESTION AS WELL I

01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:14.081
MISTER SALAD MENTIONED THE

01:44:14.147 --> 01:44:16.350
RESIDENT BEING MORE EMPOWERED

01:44:16.416 --> 01:44:18.585
IN THIS PROCESS SO- I DON'T

01:44:18.652 --> 01:44:19.286
KNOW IF THAT WAS DIRECTED

01:44:19.353 --> 01:44:20.387
TOWARDS ANYONE SENATOR COMING

01:44:20.454 --> 01:44:22.589
IT'LL BUT- ACTUALLY RESEARCHER

01:44:22.656 --> 01:44:25.759
TELLS RAISING HIS HAND. AREAS

01:44:25.826 --> 01:44:29.129
AND THEN CREEK WHEN IT IS NEXT.

01:44:29.196 --> 01:44:31.365
FOR YOUR QUESTIONS I'M VERY

01:44:31.431 --> 01:44:32.699
GOOD ONES ARE REALLY GOOD ABOUT

01:44:32.766 --> 01:44:33.767
A VISITATION BUT LET ME GET

01:44:33.834 --> 01:44:35.335
WHAT THE BIG QUESTION ARE ARE

01:44:35.402 --> 01:44:39.306
ARE ARE WE'RE LOOKING SAFE. I'M

01:44:39.373 --> 01:44:40.407
THERE'S NO WAY TO ANSWER THAT

01:44:40.474 --> 01:44:41.575
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO LOOK AT EACH

01:44:41.642 --> 01:44:43.243
FACILITY AND I GUESS THE

01:44:43.310 --> 01:44:44.478
UNCERTAINTY THAT IS SORT OF THE

01:44:44.544 --> 01:44:47.147
ANSWER QUESTIONS. WE CAN'T WE

01:44:47.214 --> 01:44:47.748
DON'T KNOW WE CAN'T GUARANTEE

01:44:47.814 --> 01:44:50.884
IT. AND I THINK EVEN PRIOR TO

01:44:50.951 --> 01:44:52.285
COPE WITH NINETEEN. THAT

01:44:52.352 --> 01:44:53.620
QUESTION WITH THE ANSWER

01:44:53.687 --> 01:44:54.888
QUESTIONS ON CERTAIN WHICH

01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:56.590
SHOULD BE ALARMING TO US. WE

01:44:56.657 --> 01:44:58.325
HAVE A RECENT G. A. L. FEDERAL

01:44:58.392 --> 01:45:00.694
GAO STATUS SENATE ONE THIRD OF

01:45:00.761 --> 01:45:01.762
RESIDENTS IN NURSING HOME

01:45:01.828 --> 01:45:03.730
SUFFERS HARM. WITHIN A FEW

01:45:03.797 --> 01:45:06.400
WEEKS OF THEIR STAY. SO THESE

01:45:06.466 --> 01:45:08.869
ARE FREE DANGEROUS PLACES

01:45:08.935 --> 01:45:10.837
ARTICLE THE NINETEEN. I KNOW

01:45:10.904 --> 01:45:11.538
THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF

01:45:11.605 --> 01:45:12.839
EFFORTS AND TO MAKE THEM SAFER

01:45:12.906 --> 01:45:14.675
AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF THOSE

01:45:14.741 --> 01:45:16.009
EFFORTS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL.

01:45:16.076 --> 01:45:17.044
BUT THERE'S STILL A LOT OF

01:45:17.110 --> 01:45:19.379
UNANSWERED. WITH HER TO

01:45:19.446 --> 01:45:21.615
VISITATION. THIS WAS ONE OF THE

01:45:21.682 --> 01:45:22.516
FIRST CASUALTIES OF THE

01:45:22.582 --> 01:45:24.584
PANDEMIC WAS WAS VISITORS AND

01:45:24.651 --> 01:45:26.753
IT'S BEEN HEARTBREAKING AND I

01:45:26.820 --> 01:45:27.721
DON'T EVEN KNOW IF THERE'S A

01:45:27.788 --> 01:45:29.156
REAL RATE PUBLICHEALTH

01:45:29.222 --> 01:45:31.224
JUSTIFICATION FOR THE EXCLUSION

01:45:31.291 --> 01:45:33.360
OF VISITORS BECAUSE THIS- SO

01:45:33.427 --> 01:45:35.762
MANY VISITORS PROVIDED DIRECT

01:45:35.829 --> 01:45:37.631
CARE SUPPLEMENTED THE CARE THAT

01:45:37.698 --> 01:45:38.965
IS PROVIDED BY SEVENTY SENSUAL

01:45:39.032 --> 01:45:41.468
CARE TURNING RESIDENTS MAKING

01:45:41.535 --> 01:45:42.736
SURE THAT. MAKING SURE THEY

01:45:42.803 --> 01:45:44.071

01:45:44.137 --> 01:45:46.406
MANY FAMILY MEMBERS WHO WHO HAD

ENTERED THE TIMES IT CAREFULLY

01:45:47.941 --> 01:45:49.810
EITHER LOCAL ONE AND THEIR NOT

01:45:49.876 --> 01:45:51.812

01:45:51.878 --> 01:45:53.346

A MEMO THAT- TWENTY DASH THIRTY

01:49:36.236 --> 01:49:37.037
TWO ALL OF THEIR FACILITIES AND

01:49:37.103 --> 01:49:39.005
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT

01:49:39.072 --> 01:49:41.207
MOST OF OUR SKILLED NURSING

01:49:41.274 --> 01:49:43.209
FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE

01:49:43.276 --> 01:49:48.949
CMS FIGHTS BEFORE. AND IN THAT

01:49:49.015 --> 01:49:50.183
IT OUTLINES SOME SAY CRACK

01:49:50.250 --> 01:49:51.351
BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING. IS THAT

01:49:51.418 --> 01:49:53.053
WHERE YOU CAN YOU FOR WHERE YOU

01:49:53.119 --> 01:49:54.921
HAVE AN UP TAKING CASES WHO

01:49:54.988 --> 01:49:56.523
ALSO TIME THE OBVIOUSLY THEN

01:49:56.589 --> 01:49:59.125
HOUSE MORE CASES. IN THOSE

01:49:59.192 --> 01:50:01.261
FACILITIES FROM A SYMPTOMATIC

01:50:01.328 --> 01:50:02.929
SPREAD WHETHER THAT BE A HEALTH

01:50:02.996 --> 01:50:04.264
CARE WORKER MAYBE THAT WOULD BE

01:50:04.331 --> 01:50:06.967
A FUTURE VISITOR ON AND SO- I

01:50:07.033 --> 01:50:09.803
AGREE- WITH MANY OF THE THINGS

01:50:09.869 --> 01:50:11.504
THAT. TONY CHECK A TOPLESS

01:50:11.571 --> 01:50:12.939
SHARED WITH ME WE'VE KIND OF

01:50:13.006 --> 01:50:16.142
HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS AROUND

01:50:16.209 --> 01:50:17.077
THIS AND I THINK MORE TO HOW WE

01:50:17.143 --> 01:50:20.113
CREATIVELY. AT THIS AND I KNOW

01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:21.982
THAT THERE ARE MANY FACILITIES-

01:50:22.048 --> 01:50:23.350
IF THEY DO NOT HAVE AN OUTBREAK

01:50:23.416 --> 01:50:25.285
IF THEY HAVE METAL THE TESTING

01:50:25.352 --> 01:50:27.120
GUIDELINES OF PP. AND ALL OF

01:50:27.187 --> 01:50:28.655
THE GUIDELINES LISTED IN C. M.

01:50:28.722 --> 01:50:31.057
S.'S MEMO THEY ARE ABLE TO THEN

01:50:31.124 --> 01:50:33.793
RE OPENS FOR AND VISITATION IF

01:50:33.860 --> 01:50:35.028
THEY COME. FOLLOW ALL OF THOSE

01:50:35.095 --> 01:50:37.197
REQUIREMENTS- AND SO I THINK

01:50:37.263 --> 01:50:39.399
ASK ME SEE THAT MOST OF OUR

01:50:39.466 --> 01:50:40.867
AFTER JUNE THIRTIETH ONCE ALL

01:50:40.934 --> 01:50:42.135
OF OUR FACILITIES AND OTHER

01:50:42.202 --> 01:50:45.005
BASELINE TESTING- DEPENDING ON

01:50:45.071 --> 01:50:46.039
WHAT THE COMMUNITY SPREAD AND

01:50:46.106 --> 01:50:48.174
IF THERE'S AN OUTBREAK VERSUS

01:50:48.241 --> 01:50:49.542
NOT AN OUTBREAK IN THEIR AREA-

01:50:49.609 --> 01:50:51.745
I. SEE PROBABLY MORE OF WHAT

01:50:51.811 --> 01:50:53.980
CRAIG- CORNET WAS DESCRIBING AS

01:50:54.047 --> 01:50:56.816
CREATIVE WAYS- THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:50:56.883 --> 01:50:59.252
TRYING TO HAVE FUN STATE.

01:50:59.319 --> 01:51:00.754
VISITATION WHETHER THAT BE

01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:02.989
THROUGH TESTING- WHETHER THAT

01:51:03.056 --> 01:51:04.424
BE THROUGH PHYSICAL DISTANCE

01:51:04.491 --> 01:51:05.992
SCENE IT'S IMPORTANT TO I KNOW

01:51:06.059 --> 01:51:08.561
A LOT OF STATESHAVE LOOKED AT

01:51:08.628 --> 01:51:13.967
NO OUT. OUT WERE SITTING. BUT

01:51:14.034 --> 01:51:14.801
IT'S IMPORTANT NOTE THAT OF OUR

01:51:14.868 --> 01:51:16.102
SOME OF OUR- RESIDENTS NEED

01:51:16.169 --> 01:51:18.171
DISABILITY ARE ABLE TO GO

01:51:18.238 --> 01:51:22.242
OUTSIDE FOR THEY DON'T- HAVE-

01:51:22.308 --> 01:51:23.943
YOU KNOW THE ABILITY TO BE

01:51:24.010 --> 01:51:26.579
MOVED IN IN SUCH A WAY- IN SO I

01:51:26.646 --> 01:51:28.114
THINK WE NEED TO KIND OF THINK

01:51:28.181 --> 01:51:28.648
CREATIVE LINE NOT AROUND.

01:51:28.715 --> 01:51:31.284
EQUITY AS FAR AS MAKING SURE

01:51:31.351 --> 01:51:34.054
THAT- THAT ALL AS ARE

01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:35.855
DISABILITIES YOU KNOW OR- ARE

01:51:35.922 --> 01:51:37.424
KIND OF LOOKING AT THOSE THOSE

01:51:37.490 --> 01:51:39.292
WAYS. BECAUSE EVEN SOME OF OUR

01:51:39.359 --> 01:51:41.227
MORE URBAN SKILLED NURSING

01:51:41.294 --> 01:51:42.862
FACILITIES MIGHT NOT EVEN HAVE-

01:51:42.929 --> 01:51:44.197
YOU KNOW SAFE PROPRIA

01:51:44.264 --> 01:51:47.067
OUTSOURCED BASIS EITHER- SO
