01:34:04.538 --> 01:34:05.539
THOSE THINGS YOU THINK WOW.

01:34:05.606 --> 01:34:06.674
THIS IS A NICELY WRAPPED

01:34:06.741 --> 01:34:07.942
PACKAGE WITH SUCH ORDINARY

01:34:08.009 --> 01:34:10.478
STUFF. YOU KNOW AND BUDGET IT

01:34:10.544 --> 01:34:11.979
BECOMES A PATH STUFF THAT YOU

01:34:12.046 --> 01:34:12.747
USE MUCH MORE THAN ANYTHING

01:34:12.813 --> 01:34:14.815
ELSE. AND I THINK ABOUT WHEN I

01:34:14.882 --> 01:34:16.317
FIRST HEARD THE JAY OBERNOLTE

01:34:16.384 --> 01:34:21.555
WAS COMING. I THOUGHT WHAT A

01:34:21.622 --> 01:34:22.957
WEIRD NAME. THIS FOUR K. LIVE

01:34:23.024 --> 01:34:24.792
HIS WHOLE WITH OLD. YOU KNOW. I

01:34:24.859 --> 01:34:27.194
MEAN. IS SO. IT SO'S GOT OF

01:34:27.261 --> 01:34:28.095
INTERESTING WHEN THEY TOLD HE

01:34:28.162 --> 01:34:30.264
WAS COME. THEN I TOLD ME HE'S

01:34:30.331 --> 01:34:31.932
REALLY RICH THAT'S THE FIRST

01:34:31.999 --> 01:34:33.100
THING I TOLD HIM ABOUT HIS

01:34:33.167 --> 01:34:35.202
REALLY RICH. AND HE FLIES HIS

01:34:35.269 --> 01:34:37.438
OWN PLANE. AND SOMEONE TOLD ME

01:34:37.505 --> 01:34:38.806
NOT JUST A- LITTLE PLANE THAT

01:34:38.873 --> 01:34:40.141
JUST PUT PUT PUT BUT IT

01:34:40.207 --> 01:34:42.309
ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS PLANE. THAT

01:34:42.376 --> 01:34:43.778
HE FLIES INTO TO THE CAPITOL

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:47.014
EVERY BISHOP EVERY WEEK. AND

01:34:47.081 --> 01:34:48.416
THAT HE LIVES IN A PENTHOUSE. I

01:34:48.482 --> 01:34:50.284
THOUGHT OH MY GOD YOU KNOW THIS

01:34:50.351 --> 01:34:51.719
IS A GAME OF THIS BEAUTIFULLY

01:34:51.786 --> 01:34:53.421
WRAPPED PERSON. AND I THOUGHT

01:34:53.487 --> 01:34:54.722
OH MY GOODNESS HOW RELEVANT

01:34:54.789 --> 01:34:56.724
HE'S GONNA BE. AND HOW IT-

01:34:56.791 --> 01:34:59.060
AGAIN HE'S GOING TO BE. AND HOW

01:34:59.126 --> 01:34:59.693
HE'S GOING TO MAKE US ALL FEEL%

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:01.228
SO SMALL BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

01:35:01.295 --> 01:35:03.230
ALL THE GOOD STUFF HE HAS. AND

01:35:03.297 --> 01:35:04.732
HOW WILL I EVER EXPLAIN TO HIM.

01:35:04.799 --> 01:35:06.734
WHAT LIFE IS LIKE IN THE

01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:08.536
SEVENTY NINTH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT.

01:35:08.602 --> 01:35:09.270
HOWEVER EXPLAINED TO HIM MY

01:35:09.336 --> 01:35:11.338
LIFE. AND THOSE THINGS THAT ARE

01:35:11.405 --> 01:35:14.375
IMPORTANT TO ME. THE DRIVE THE

01:35:14.442 --> 01:35:16.610
EVERYDAY PERSON IN CALIFORNIA.

01:35:16.677 --> 01:35:18.746
BUT I SAID I WON'T I'LL GIVEN

01:35:18.813 --> 01:35:20.614
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT. AND

01:35:20.681 --> 01:35:23.150
I'LL SEE WHAT IT'S REALLY LIKE.

01:35:23.217 --> 01:35:24.685
AND THEN WE HAD OUR BOWLING

01:35:24.752 --> 01:35:26.320
EXPERIENCE AND HE PROBABLY

01:35:26.387 --> 01:35:27.521
DOESN'T EVEN REMEMBER THIS

01:35:27.588 --> 01:35:30.224
BECAUSE MY OFFICE WAS KIND OF

01:35:30.291 --> 01:35:31.926
NEXT TO HIS. AND HE CAN REALLY

01:35:31.992 --> 01:35:34.829
BOWL. AND I SAID NO RICH DO

01:35:34.895 --> 01:35:38.132
GLOBAL LIKE THIS. YOU KNOW HOW

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:39.200
HE WOULD HAVE HIS BUTLER'S

01:35:39.266 --> 01:35:40.501
BOWLING HE DIDN'T TAKE THE

01:35:40.568 --> 01:35:42.803
SCORE I MEAN YOU KNOW THERE'S

01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:43.838
NO THERE'S NO WAY THAT HE COULD

01:35:43.904 --> 01:35:45.139
HAVE THIS LEVEL OF BALI AND HE

01:35:45.206 --> 01:35:46.540
WAS STRIKING THINGS AND HE WAS

01:35:46.607 --> 01:35:47.842
JUST I MEAN IT REALLY WAS

01:35:47.908 --> 01:35:49.543
REMINDED ME OF THE DAYS WHEN I

01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:50.811
WAS A KID AND WE ACTUALLY HAD

01:35:50.878 --> 01:35:52.146
THESE. FOLKS WHO COULD REALLY

01:35:52.213 --> 01:35:53.981
BOWL YOU KNOW BECAUSE THIS

01:35:54.048 --> 01:35:55.349
GENERATION DOESN'T REALLY BALL

01:35:55.416 --> 01:35:57.017
A LOT BUT NINETY IT NOTHING

01:35:57.084 --> 01:35:58.886
COULD PRETTY CAN GET HOLD THIS

01:35:58.953 --> 01:36:00.521
BALDING FROM AND THEN I HAD A

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:02.423
CHANCE TO SEE HIS WIFE AND SHE

01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:04.792
WASN'T YOU KNOW. ALL THAT SHE

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:05.759
WAS LIKE YOU KNOW SOMETHING

01:36:05.826 --> 01:36:07.528
FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY SHE WAS

01:36:07.595 --> 01:36:09.697
JUST AN ORDINARY EVERYDAY

01:36:09.763 --> 01:36:12.633
WOMAN. AND I THOUGHT HOME THIS

01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:15.436
IS A DIFFERENT PERSON THIS IS A

01:36:15.503 --> 01:36:15.970
DIFFERENT PACKAGE THIS IS

01:36:16.036 --> 01:36:17.371
CONTENT THAN THE PACKAGE I GOT

01:36:17.438 --> 01:36:20.341
THAT WAS ALL WRAPPED PRETTY.

01:36:20.407 --> 01:36:20.808
AND I DECIDED I WOULD

01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:22.977
INVESTIGATE WHO THIS PERSON IS.

01:36:23.043 --> 01:36:25.146
AND I BEGAN TO TALK TO HIM. AND

01:36:25.212 --> 01:36:26.247
I LEARNED IS JUST HOW MUCH HE

01:36:26.313 --> 01:36:28.883
WAS LIKE ME. A KID WHO GREW UP

01:36:28.949 --> 01:36:31.051
WITH VERY LITTLE. BUT WHOSE

01:36:31.118 --> 01:36:32.386
PARENTS BELIEVED STRONGLY IN

01:36:32.453 --> 01:36:34.655
HIM HIS MOTHER. RAISED IN WITH

01:36:34.722 --> 01:36:36.924
SOME VERY STRONG VALUES ABOUT

01:36:36.991 --> 01:36:39.994
LIFE AND PEOPLE AND HIS FAMILY.

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:40.561
AND HOW MUCH SHE CARED ABOUT

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:42.897
CALIFORNIA. AND HOW MUCH YOU

01:36:42.963 --> 01:36:46.167
CAN REACH ACROSS THE LINES IN

01:36:46.233 --> 01:36:46.634
THE IN THE PARTY'S AND

01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:47.234
BASICALLY GET TO THE ISSUES

01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:48.769
THAT WOULD BE HERE. I LEARNED

01:36:48.836 --> 01:36:51.639
HE WAS VERY SMART. AND ONE OF

01:36:51.705 --> 01:36:52.406
THINGS I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO MY

01:36:52.473 --> 01:36:53.607
LIFE BECAUSE PEOPLE LOOK AT YOU

01:36:53.674 --> 01:36:54.542
AND SAY ALL YOU HAVE ALL THESE

01:36:54.608 --> 01:36:56.277
DEGREES I'VE TRIED TO MAKE SURE

01:36:56.343 --> 01:36:57.545
PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THAT THOSE

01:36:57.611 --> 01:36:59.413
DEGREES DIDN'T DEFINE ME. THERE

01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:00.915
WERE THINGS I DID IN ORDER TO

01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:02.583
MAKE MY LIFE A LITTLE EASIER

01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:04.151
BUT I WAS STILL THIS LITTLE

01:37:04.218 --> 01:37:05.886
GIRL FROM PROJECTS. AND WHEN I

01:37:05.953 --> 01:37:07.922
MET HIM HE WAS STILL THIS

01:37:07.988 --> 01:37:09.623
ORDINARY PERSON. HE WAS SMART

01:37:09.690 --> 01:37:11.392
BUT IT WAS AN ARROGANT. AND I

01:37:11.458 --> 01:37:12.927
COULD SIT AND TALK TO HIM ABOUT

01:37:12.993 --> 01:37:14.929
EDUCATIONAL ISSUES AND HIS

01:37:14.995 --> 01:37:16.297
FAMILY AND HIS CHILDREN AND HOW

01:37:16.363 --> 01:37:18.265
HE WAS RAISING HIS SONS. AND

01:37:18.332 --> 01:37:19.833
UNDERSTAND THE CONFLICTS THAT

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:21.702
HE WAS IN WITH REGARDS TO ONE

01:37:21.769 --> 01:37:23.170
BEING ONE WAY AND ONE BEING

01:37:23.237 --> 01:37:24.205
ANOTHER THE KIND OF CHALLENGES

01:37:24.271 --> 01:37:26.774
THAT FAMILIES HAVE. ANY REALLY

01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:28.342
WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THEM. I

01:37:28.409 --> 01:37:29.877
LEARNED A LOT ABOUT HIS WIFE

01:37:29.944 --> 01:37:31.078
AND HOW MUCH SHE CARED ABOUT

01:37:31.145 --> 01:37:33.380
HIM AND THE FAMILY. AND HOW HE

01:37:33.447 --> 01:37:35.716
EVERYTHING HE DID WAS REALLY

01:37:35.783 --> 01:37:36.250
DESIGNED TO BUILD A STRONG

01:37:36.317 --> 01:37:39.253
FAMILY. BUT I LEARNED A OF HIM

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:40.454
ONE TIME WHEN I WAS MY FAMILY

01:37:40.521 --> 01:37:42.022
WAS DEBATING WHERE WE'RE GOING

01:37:42.089 --> 01:37:43.257

THURSDAY CAME BACK OF MONDAY HE

01:38:06.347 --> 01:38:07.948
SAID. YOU DON'T HAVE A LIST FOR

01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:09.416
YOU HE SAYS BUT- WE HAVE

01:38:09.483 --> 01:38:11.752
ANOTHER RECOMMENDATION I SAID

OKAY WHAT IS THAT. HE SAID.

01:38:13.187 --> 01:38:16.023

01:38:24.031 --> 01:38:26.400
REALLY WE NEVER HAD SOMEBODY

01:38:26.467 --> 01:38:27.901
WHO KIND OF KNOWS ME THAT WE'VE

01:38:27.968 --> 01:38:30.237
TALKED A LOT ABOUT WHO TRUST ME

01:38:30.304 --> 01:38:32.473
WITH HIS HOUSE. BUT IT ALSO

01:38:32.539 --> 01:38:33.874
SAID A LOT ABOUT THE FACT THAT

01:38:33.941 --> 01:38:35.075
POSSESSIONS WERE NOT REALLY

01:38:35.142 --> 01:38:37.978
THAT IMPORTANT. IT'S NICE TO

01:38:38.045 --> 01:38:38.612
HAVE BUT IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO

01:38:38.679 --> 01:38:40.781
SHARE. AND HE REALLY WAS HONEST

01:38:40.848 --> 01:38:43.884
ABOUT IT. OF COURSE MY FAMILY

01:38:43.951 --> 01:38:46.954
CHOSE GO TO Y. COURSE. BUT I

01:38:47.021 --> 01:38:49.056
FELT SO HONORED I FELT SO

01:38:49.123 --> 01:38:50.924
HONORED THAT DESPITE THAT YOU

01:38:50.991 --> 01:38:52.293

01:38:52.359 --> 01:38:53.694
WHY BUT I TOLD MY FAMILY I SAID

01:38:53.761 --> 01:38:55.629
YOU KNOW I FEEL VERY

01:38:55.696 --> 01:38:56.230
COMFORTABLE THAT IF WE WANTED

01:38:56.297 --> 01:38:58.232
TO GO TO BIG BEAR. THAT WE

01:38:58.299 --> 01:39:00.267
WOULD NOT BE IMPOSING UPON HIM.

01:39:00.334 --> 01:39:01.602
AND THAT WAS JUST A SMALL

01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:02.870
EXAMPLE WHEN I'M STRUGGLING

01:39:02.936 --> 01:39:04.905
WITH THE ISSUE OF COMING BACK

01:39:04.972 --> 01:39:05.506
AND WHETHER NOT OF MY AGE IT

01:39:05.572 --> 01:39:06.907
WOULD BE SMART. WHAT WE WOULD

01:39:06.974 --> 01:39:08.175
DO THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND

01:39:08.242 --> 01:39:09.610
WAS COMMITTEE HEARING IT. WE

01:39:09.677 --> 01:39:11.111
GOT INFORMATION THAT WE COULD

01:39:11.178 --> 01:39:12.146
REMOTE AND WE COULDN'T MOVE

01:39:12.212 --> 01:39:13.681

REYES BUT YOU GIVE US A

01:40:00.894 --> 01:40:02.029
PERSPECTIVE IT'S NOT

NECESSARILY GROUNDED JUSTIN

01:40:03.464 --> 01:40:05.299

YOU IS MY COLLEAGUES HAS BEEN

01:49:22.322 --> 01:49:22.822
ONE OF THE HIGH HONORS OF MY

01:49:22.889 --> 01:49:26.326
LIFE. WHEN I WAS FIRST ELECTED.

01:49:26.393 --> 01:49:28.428
TO THE ASSEMBLY SIX YEARS AGO.

01:49:28.495 --> 01:49:31.197
I TOOK SOME TIME AND MET WITH.

01:49:31.264 --> 01:49:32.632
DEPARTING MEMBERS OF THE

01:49:32.699 --> 01:49:34.067
LEGISLATURE BECAUSE I WANTED TO

01:49:34.134 --> 01:49:35.969
SEE WHAT ADVICE THEY WOULD GIVE

01:49:36.036 --> 01:49:38.071
TO A NEOPHYTE FRESHMAN. AND

01:49:38.138 --> 01:49:40.507
MUCH TO MY SURPRISE. MOST OF

01:49:40.573 --> 01:49:42.809
THEM SAID THIS THEY SAID THE

01:49:42.876 --> 01:49:43.777
THING THAT I'M GOING TO MISS

01:49:43.843 --> 01:49:45.879
THE MOST. IS THE RELATIONSHIPS

01:49:45.946 --> 01:49:47.547
THAT I BUILT. WITH THE PEOPLE

01:49:47.614 --> 01:49:50.116
THAT I SERVE WITH. AND THAT

01:49:50.183 --> 01:49:51.351
REALLY WENT COUNTER TO MY

01:49:51.418 --> 01:49:53.019
EXPECTATIONS COMING INTO THE

01:49:53.086 --> 01:49:53.753
BODY I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY

01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:55.388
PARTISAN I THOUGHT IT WAS ERY

01:49:55.455 --> 01:49:57.023
POLITICAL I REALLY HADN'T

01:49:57.090 --> 01:49:59.759
GRASPED THIS IDEA. THAT YOU

01:49:59.826 --> 01:50:00.193
COULD BUILD PERSONAL

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:02.028
FRIENDSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS.

01:50:02.095 --> 01:50:03.930
WITH SEVENTY NINE OTHER PEOPLE

01:50:03.997 --> 01:50:05.498
AND FORTY PEOPLE IN THE SENATE.

01:50:05.565 --> 01:50:07.233
BUT NOW AS I LOOK BACK ON MY

01:50:07.300 --> 01:50:08.168
TIME I THINK THEY WERE

01:50:08.234 --> 01:50:09.970
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S

01:50:10.036 --> 01:50:10.570
THE THING THAT I AM GOING TO

01:50:10.637 --> 01:50:12.339
CHURCH THE MOST. IS MY

01:50:12.405 --> 01:50:13.173
FRIENDSHIPS AND MY

01:50:13.239 --> 01:50:15.208
RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOME AMAZING

PEOPLE THAT I SERVE WITH. WHAT

01:50:17.644 --> 01:50:19.179
WHAT I WAS FIRST ELECTED. I

01:50:19.245 --> 01:50:20.714
REMEMBER FRESHMAN ORIENTATION

01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:21.915
WAS RUN BY RICH GORDON RIMMER

01:50:21.982 --> 01:50:26.152
RICH. AN AMAZING HUMAN BEING AN

01:50:26.219 --> 01:50:32.926
AMAZING FRIEND. AND. I REMEMBER

01:50:32.993 --> 01:50:33.860
THAT BEING ONE OF THE

01:50:33.927 --> 01:50:35.395
HIGHLIGHTS OF MY FIRST TERM AND

01:50:35.462 --> 01:50:37.630
SO WHEN HE TURNED OUT I SAID TO

01:50:37.697 --> 01:50:39.466
HIM RICH. THESE BIPARTISAN

01:50:39.532 --> 01:50:41.234
DINNERS YOU KNOW REALLY CHANGED

01:50:41.301 --> 01:50:42.035
MY TRAJECTORY OF THE

01:50:42.102 --> 01:50:44.371
LEGISLATURE IN- WE NEED TO KEEP

01:50:44.437 --> 01:50:46.072
DOING THEM SO LET ME KNOW WHO

01:50:47.574 --> 01:50:50.210
TO HELP. AND HE SAID WHAT J. NO

01:50:50.276 --> 01:50:50.744
ONE HAS STEPPED UP SO IT'S

01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:53.179
GOING TO BE YOU. AND I SAID

01:50:53.246 --> 01:50:55.248
RICH I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE

01:50:55.315 --> 01:50:56.783
NOTICED BUT I'M A REPUBLICAN.

01:50:56.850 --> 01:50:57.784
ANY SORT OF DOESN'T MATTER

01:50:57.851 --> 01:50:59.152
THEY'RE BIPARTISAN DINNERS AND

01:50:59.219 --> 01:51:00.220
SO FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS

01:51:00.286 --> 01:51:01.621
HEATHER AND I HAVE BEEN DOING

01:51:01.688 --> 01:51:03.990
THOSE AND- WHAT A BLESSING IT'S

01:51:04.057 --> 01:51:05.492
BEEN FOR US TO ACTUALLY SIT

01:51:05.558 --> 01:51:08.428
DOWN BREAK BREAD WITH PEOPLE.

01:51:08.495 --> 01:51:09.696
GET TO KNOW. COLLEAGUES ON A

01:51:09.763 --> 01:51:11.898
PERSONAL LEVEL KIND OF OUTSIDE

01:51:11.965 --> 01:51:12.499
OF THE BUILDING IN THE HUSTLE

01:51:12.565 --> 01:51:14.434
AND BUSTLE OF LEGISLATION- IT'S

01:51:14.501 --> 01:51:16.202
BEEN AMAZING AND SO I WANT TO

01:51:16.269 --> 01:51:17.370
CHALLENGE YOU SOMEBODY'S GONNA

01:51:17.437 --> 01:51:18.872
TAKE UP THAT MANTLE BECAUSE

01:51:18.938 --> 01:51:20.507
IT'S AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM. IT'S

01:51:20.573 --> 01:51:21.474
AN IMPORTANT EFFORT AND

01:51:21.541 --> 01:51:24.010
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO STEP UP AND

01:51:24.077 --> 01:51:24.611
DO IT SO. LET ME KNOW IF I CAN

01:51:24.677 --> 01:51:26.780
HELP. ANOTHER THING THAT HAS

01:51:26.846 --> 01:51:28.648
BEEN. REALLY UNEXPECTED AND

01:51:28.715 --> 01:51:30.016
AMAZING TO ME IS THAT SOME OF

01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:32.018
THE PEOPLE. THAT I BUILT THE

01:51:32.085 --> 01:51:33.286
CLOSEST FRIENDSHIPS AND

01:51:33.353 --> 01:51:35.822
RELATIONSHIPS WITH ON THIS

01:51:35.889 --> 01:51:36.423
FLOOR HAVE BEEN THE PEOPLE. I

01:51:36.489 --> 01:51:38.758
ACTUALLY FROM A POLICY

01:51:38.825 --> 01:51:39.325
STANDPOINT DISAGREE WITH THE

01:51:39.392 --> 01:51:42.295
MOST. AND AT FIRST IT SEEMED

01:51:42.362 --> 01:51:43.396
VERY ODD TO ME BUT IN

01:51:43.463 --> 01:51:45.498
RETROSPECT I THINK IT'S VERY

01:51:45.565 --> 01:51:46.132
NATURAL BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE

01:51:46.199 --> 01:51:47.967
AN OBLIGATION. NOT ONLY IS

01:51:48.034 --> 01:51:49.803
LAWMAKERS BUT AS HUMAN BEINGS

01:51:49.869 --> 01:51:51.538
TO BROADEN OUR HORIZONS. TO

01:51:51.604 --> 01:51:53.273
SEEK OUT ALTERNATE OPINIONS AT

01:51:53.339 --> 01:51:55.041
THE FIGURE OUT WHAT IT IS IN

01:51:55.108 --> 01:51:55.675
SOMEONE'S BACKGROUND THAT MAKES

01:51:55.742 --> 01:51:58.411
THEM HOLD. A VIEWPOINT THAT'S

01:51:58.478 --> 01:51:59.012
SO DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE THAT

01:51:59.079 --> 01:52:01.114
WE HOLD. BECAUSE ONE OF THE

01:52:01.181 --> 01:52:02.949
THINGS THAT- THAT I TREASURE

01:52:03.016 --> 01:52:03.917
ABOUT THE FRIENDSHIPS I'VE

01:52:03.983 --> 01:52:05.251
BUILT HERE. IS THAT THERE'S

01:52:05.318 --> 01:52:08.254
ALWAYS A REASON. I MEAN WE ARE

01:52:08.321 --> 01:52:09.589
HERE. FOR THE SAME PURPOSE

01:52:09.656 --> 01:52:10.490
WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME TEAM WE

01:52:10.557 --> 01:52:12.659
PLAY FOR TEAM CALIFORNIA. AND

01:52:12.725 --> 01:52:14.627
WE ALL CARE PASSIONATELY ABOUT

01:52:14.694 --> 01:52:15.595
MAKING LIFE BETTER FOR THE

01:52:15.662 --> 01:52:16.729
PEOPLE THAT ELECTED US THE

01:52:16.796 --> 01:52:18.565
PEOPLE WE REPRESENT. SO IF WE

01:52:18.631 --> 01:52:20.800
DISAGREE ON SOMETHING IT'S GOT

01:52:20.867 --> 01:52:21.367
TO BE SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL

01:52:21.434 --> 01:52:23.103
ABOUT UR BACKGROUND. AND WE

01:52:23.169 --> 01:52:24.471

01:52:24.537 --> 01:52:25.638
EXPERIENCES AND DIFFERENT A

01:52:25.705 --> 01:52:27.440
DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCE TO

HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE WITHOUT

01:52:54.801 --> 01:52:55.702

01:52:55.768 --> 01:52:58.138

HAVE VERY LITTLE STAFF TURNOVER

01:53:02.208 --> 01:53:03.810

THAT I'M NOT THE EASIEST PERSON

01:53:11.784 --> 01:53:15.655
TO WORK FOR. I DON'T THINK THAT

01:53:15.722 --> 01:53:16.289
THAT'S TRUE FOR THE RECORD BUT-

01:53:16.356 --> 01:53:18.258

WHEN THE BIG THE BIG FEARS THAT

01:53:35.074 --> 01:53:36.442
I HAD WHEN I WAS ELECTED IS

01:53:36.509 --> 01:53:37.744
THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO

01:53:37.810 --> 01:53:38.411
SACRAMENTO AND HAVE A LIFE

01:53:38.478 --> 01:53:40.480

BEEN PHENOMENAL IN PART OF OUR

THOSE IMMEDIATELY AROUND US AND

I LEARN FROM ALL OF YOU TO

02:09:39.605 --> 02:09:41.440
DEFEND. SO I NEVER WALKED OFF

02:09:41.507 --> 02:09:43.075
THIS FLOOR NOT THINKING IN MY

WERE VERY HELPFUL. IN YOUR

02:09:52.518 --> 02:09:54.052
WORDS IN YOUR GUIDANCE IN YOUR

02:09:54.119 --> 02:09:54.520
INSPIRATION IN YOUR

02:09:54.586 --> 02:09:56.054
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT. YOUR

02:09:57.456 --> 02:09:59.158

02:09:59.224 --> 02:10:00.325
CONSEQUENCES MIGHT BE WHAT THE

02:10:00.392 --> 02:10:02.794
REAL COSTS. MIGHT BE. AND HOW

02:10:02.861 --> 02:10:03.929
WE COULD ALL WORK TO LEAVE THIS

02:10:03.996 --> 02:10:05.697

AND WAS PRIVILEGED TO HAVE

02:10:20.746 --> 02:10:23.081

SAY TO NOT HAVE IT BE TRITE.

02:10:30.522 --> 02:10:32.791
AND TO HAVE IT BE MEANINGFUL.

02:10:32.858 --> 02:10:36.495
BUT WHAT I HAVE LEARNED. MOST

02:10:36.562 --> 02:10:37.696

SO EASY FOR ME TO REPRESENT MY
