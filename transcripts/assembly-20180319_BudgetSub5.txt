BY ALLOWING FOR MORE BOOK PURCHASES THEY'VE ESTIMATED THAT IN ABOUT SIX TO SEVEN YEARS THEY'LL BE ABLE TO SAVE MONEY ENOUGH MONEY TO COVER YOU KNOW THAT WOULD EQUAL THE COST OF BUILDING THIS ADDITIONAL FREEZE. OKAY. THE COMMENTS. INCOME FOR MEMBERS. MOVING ON ITEM NUMBER ELEVEN ITEM ELEVEN. STATEWIDE BUDGET PACKAGES IN ADVANCE PLANNING. THIS. FUNDING ALLOWS US TO. TAKE THE. THE CONCEPT THAT COME FROM PRISONS. FOR THINGS THAT NEED TO BE CONSTRUCTED OR RENOVATED AND TO TAKE THOSE AND PROVIDE MORE AYE IF FLESH AMOUNTS OF THAT THEIR WELL DEVELOPED PROPOSALS BEFORE WE BRING THEM TO COMMITTEE OF BEING ABLE TO DO BETTER BUDGET ESTIMATION AND SCHEDULE ESTIMATION. NO COMMENT FROM EITHER SIDE. OKAY APPROVAL ON ITEM NUMBER TWELVE. ALL RIGHT. BACK UP TO A PELICAN BAY STATE PRISON. THIS IS ALSO IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE.

MOVING ON TO ITEM NUMBER THIRTEEN ITEM THIRTEEN. THAT'S ALSO ANOTHER CLASSROOM PROJECT SO AS THE COMMITTEE KNOWS WE'VE DONE A LOT OF EXPANSION OF OUR REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS AND IN MOST OF OUR PRISONS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THAT WITHIN EXISTING SPACE. AYE ISSUE THIRTEEN AND ISSUE FOURTEEN ARE TWO PLACES WHERE AN ADDITIONAL SPACES CA IS NEEDED. AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE PRISON SACRAMENTO. SINCE WAS BUILT NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF. CHANGES OF MISSION A LOT OF MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMMING THERE AND SO PROGRAM SPACE WAS AVAILABLE IN THE ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION. NOT AVAILABLE NOW FOR OUR OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT PROGRAMS.

INMATE POPULATION ABOUT SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE INMATES ARE HIGH RISK MEDICAL INMATES ON THIS ONE YARD A LARGE NUMBER OF DIABETICS AND. BECAUSE OF THE ABILITY AND ONE REASON WHY THEY'RE ALL THERE IS BECAUSE IT'S A PLACE WHERE WE CAN RECRUIT.

THE PROS OR CONS. RIGHT THANK YOU THEN THAT TAKES US BACK ITEM NUMBER ONE THE VENTURA TRAINING CENTER GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR WEBER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CAN TIM LOT DIRECTOR OF CAL FIRE. NOT WITH ME TODAY ARE MY PARTNERS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS WHO WE'VE BEEN IN A LONG STANDING PARTNERSHIP WITH A. OVER THE DECADE SUPPORTING A CRUISE FOR FIRE FIGHTING AROUND THE STATE AS WELL AS CONSERVATION WORK. TO ADDRESS THAT THE CRITICAL FUELS IN FORCE MANAGEMENT A ACTIVITIES NEEDED AROUND THE STATE WERE BEFORE YOU TODAY FOR A PROPOSAL. OFFER AN ENHANCED FIREFIGHTER TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM WHAT'S PROPOSED IS THAT RE PURPOSING THE EXISTING VENTURA CONSERVATION CAMP NEAR CAMERINO. UP INTO AN ENHANCED FIREFIGHTER TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM. ULTIMATELY UP TO EIGHTY PARTICIPANTS WOULD BE SELECTED FOR THIS PROGRAM AND BEGIN AN EIGHTEEN MONTH. PROCESS OF TRAINING EDUCATION ARE TO GET BUT RECEIVE TRAINING BEYOND JUST OF THE OF THE OF HAND CREW WILDLAND FIREFIGHTING SKILL SET. UP BUT ALSO AT MORE ADVANCED. FIRE FIGHTING FIGHTING AND FIRE SERVICE TRAINING SUCH AS THE. FIRE MARSHAL A FIREFIGHTER ONE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM. BUT ULTIMATELY THESE PARTICIPANTS AFTER THE SIX MONTHS OF TRAINING AND EDUCATION WILL PROVIDE TWELVE MONTHS A ON THE GROUND OF A FIRE CREW. AND CONSERVATION WORK OPTICALLY ALONG THE CENTRAL COAST ARE AND IN THE VENTURA COUNTY AREA BUT CERTAINLY BE AVAILABLE TO RESPOND OF STATEWIDE. WELL AS A FIRE CREW OUT ONCE COMPLETION OF THE EIGHTEEN MONTHS THESE OPERATIVES DEPENDS WILL. BE ELIGIBLE TO COMPETE FOR. FIREFIGHTING JOBS AROUND CALIFORNIA WELL IT'S UNDERSTOOD THAT MANY OF FIRE DEPARTMENTS AROUND CALIFORNIA REQUIRE EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN CERTIFICATION WHICH DOES REQUIRE A BACKGROUND CHECK. HELLFIRE AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS WHILE IT'S A DESIRED QUALIFICATION A HIGHER QUALITY AND USE IT AS A DESIRED QUALIFICATION THEN IT'S NOT A REQUIRED. ELEMENT OF THE MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS. BUT CAL FIRE WILL WORK DIRECTLY WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION TO SELECT PARTICIPANTS FOR THIS PROGRAM. ARE DIRECTLY FROM OUR EXISTING CONSERVATION CAN'T PROGRAMS OF THESE WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL INMATE FIREFIGHTERS WHO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY. OUT LEFT THAT PROGRAM AND ARE ARE BEING RECOMMENDED BY BOTH A DEPARTMENTS. BUT IN ADDITION TO THE. THE EX OFFENDER PORTION OF THIS PROGRAM OTHER IS ALSO A SPACE AVAILABLE AND IS IT ENCOURAGED TO HAVE UP TO TWENTY CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS A PROGRAM MEMBERS ABBY PART OF THIS PROGRAM AND TRAIN. AT THE SAME TIME TO RECEIVE BENEFIT FROM. THIS ADVANCED TRAINING AGAIN TO PROVIDE OF SKILL SET BACK AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS NOT ONLY AT CAL FIRE FOR LONG STANDING CAREERS BUT FOR OTHER DEPARTMENTS ARE AROUND CALIFORNIA. THAT ALTERNATE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUES. THANK YOU ARE CHECK WEBER AND. MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE BROUGH PSYCHO OR DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS THE ROLE OF THE CCC WILL BE TO HIRE THE. TRAINEES. WHETHER INITIALLY THERE ARE PROBABLY TWENTY THIS FALL BUT EVENTUALLY. EIGHTY WOULD STAFF THAT TERM CONSERVATION CAP INVENTOR. AND BY HIRING THAT WOULD INCLUDE. BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYROLL FOR. I HEALTH BENEFITS AND ANY OTHER RELATED HIM RESOURCES ON ISSUES. ARM IN ADDITION. CHIEF PROMOTE MENTIONED WE WOULD HAVE TRAINEES CURRENT. ARE. TYPICAL. EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD O. ADULT COURT MEMBERS. THAT ARE NOW ARE IT THREE FIRE CENTERS. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH CAL FIRE. AT BUTTE AT OUR PLASTER CENTER AND OUR CAMERA SET OF THOSE THOSE CORE MEMBERS WOULD GO THROUGH THE. AND CAL FAR TRAINING. BASIC FIREFIGHTING TRAINING AND OTHER RELATED FAR SCIENCE FIRE TRAINING. OF COURSE ISN'T CURRICULUM AT THAT VENTURA CAMP. GOOD AFTERNOON JERRY POWERS DIRECTOR OF FIVE. DAPPLE I JUST WANNA MAKE A COUPLE OF BRIEF COMMENTS ABOUT SOME OF THE. QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN FORWARDED TO US REGARDING THE POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS AND. AND THE OVERALL PROGRAM. ARMED ONE OF THE ONE OF THE OBSERVATIONS ARE ONE OF THE CONCERNS WAS THAT. THE PROGRAM WOULD BE SERVING LOW RISK NOBLE LOW RISK LOW NEED. INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD BEEN RELEASED. AND OR ON PAROLE I HAVE MY STAFF GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE. AT THE RELEASE YA CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS POPULATION AND WE RELEASED A THOUSAND AND SEVENTY FIVE INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN JULY AND DECEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN FROM THE UP THE CAMP PROGRAM. FORTY PART FORTY TWO PERCENT UP POPULATION WAS HIGH RISK. IF YOU ADD IN THE MODERATE RISK YOU HAVE SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF WHO ARE EITHER MODERATE TO HIGH RISK. TO RE OFFEND. ADDITIONALLY. THIRTEEN ONLY THIRTEEN PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAD EITHER A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA OR GED. SO I THINK THAT TIME ABOUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS POPULATION IT CERTAINLY POPULATION THAT HAS. BUT. F. FAIRLY HIGH. NEED FOR STABLE HOUSING FOR MEANINGFUL EMPLOYMENT ARE IN LACKEY NAT THEIR RECIDIVISM RATE CERTAINLY DOM. WOULD BE RIGHT UP THERE WITHOUT WITH OUR GENERAL POPULATION. THE OTHER SORT OF. FEEDBACK WE'VE GOT IS THAT THIS PROGRAMS OUT AN EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM. WILL THERE ISN'T ANOTHER PROGRAM LIKE IT'S FOR US TO SAY THAT YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN REPLICATED ELSEWHERE. MOST PROGRAMS DON'T START OUT AS EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS BOMB BUT WHAT I CAN ASSURE YOU IS THAT WHEN WE DO THE CONTRACT FOR THE COMMUNITY BASED PROVIDER. THEY WILL USED EVIDENCE THEY WILL USE EVIDENCE BASED APPROACHES IN THEIR COUNSELING PROGRAMS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. AND CERTAINLY WE DO KNOW THAT PROVIDING HOUSING PROVIDING JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND GETTING PAROLEES ARE EMPLOYED. REDUCES THE RISK TO OFFEND WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY AN EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICE. SO I'M. A A I WOULD SAY THAT. YOU KNOW THE ENEMY FIRE FIRE PROGRAM THAT CDC ARE AND CAL FIRE HIS. HAS HAS BEEN OPERATING FOR YEARS IS PROBLY ONE OF THE BEST DEALS IN STATE GOVERNMENT. AND WE CERTAINLY SEE THIS I SEE THIS AS A. AS AS PART OF THAT CONTINUUM AND. I THINK INVESTING IN IN THESE PAROLEES WHO'VE. HERE'S IN OUR IN OUR INMATE CAMPS TO COME OUT AND BE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME. A CCC GRADUATE AND BECOME A FIREFIGHTER OR BECOME SOME OTHER PROFESSION THAT THEY GOT THE THE TRAINING FOR. IS CERTAINLY A WORTHWHILE ENDEAVOR ARE IN AND I WOULD CALL THAT EVIDENCE BASED EVERYDAY. THANK YOU. ANY COMMENTS FROM FINANCE. BELIAU. YES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CALEDONIA WITH THE LA SHOW WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THE PROPOSAL PRIMARILY BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE COST EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING RECIDIVISM WHICH THE ADMINISTRATION HAS CITED AS ITS PRIMARY GOAL. FOR THE PROPOSAL. WE THINK IT'S NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR THREE REASONS FIRST IT'S NOT EVIDENCE BASE THAT IS THERE WERE NOT AWARE OF SIMILAR PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUND FOUND TO BE WRITTEN EFFECTIVE. I'M AT REDUCING RECIDIVISM AND THERE'S ALSO NO PLAN TO FOR A. REBUT INDEPENDENT OR RIGOROUS ENOUGH EVALUATION TO ASSESS WHETHER THE PROGRAM IS INDEED EFFECTIVE ONCE IT'S IMPLEMENTED. SECOND IT'S TARGETED I PAROLEES TO PEOPLE WHO APPEAR TO BE. AMONG THE LEAST LIKELY TO NEED SERVICES IN CDC ARE A. AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLANNING TO RECRUIT PRIMARILY INMATE FIREFIGHTERS AS YOU'VE HEARD. WHICH IS A POPULATION THAT IS BELIEVED GENERALLY TO BE OF LOW RISK TO THE COMMUNITY AND HAS DEMONSTRATED A WILLINGNESS AND ABILITY TO WORK. I THROUGH THE FIRE THEIR ASSIGNMENT TO THE FIRE CAMP HOW AND YOU HEARD SOME STATISTICS JUST NOW I AM I THINK THE KEY THING TO NOTE IS. HOW THEY COMPARE HOW THE? FIRE CAMP POPULATION WOULD COMPARE TO THEM E. THE REMAINDER OF THE PAROLEES AS FAR AS THEIR THEIR RISK IN NEEDS. AND IT'S AN ADDITIONALLY IT'S THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T PROVIDED AT PLAN AS TO HOW THEY WOULD TARGET. BUT I AM. INDETERMINATE BEAST OF THE PROPOSED SERVICES TOWARD INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED NEED NOT JUST RISK OF RECIDIVISM BUT NEED FOR EMPLOYMENT SERVICES SPECIFICALLY OR HOUSING ETCETERA THAT THE PROGRAM WOULD. POTENTIALLY PROVIDE. IN OTHER WORDS THE ADMINISTRATION IT APPEARS IS PLANNING TO TARGET THE PROGRAM TO PAROLEES WHO LIKELY HAVE LESS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT SO TO SPEAK RELATIVE TO. THE GENERAL PEARLY POPULATION. OR TO OTHER POTENTIALLY MORE HIGH RISK PAROLEES OUT THERE. AND THIRD IT APPEARS UNLIKELY TO LEAD TO EMPLOYMENT AND THE ADMINISTRATION HASN'T DONE THE LABOR MARKET ANALYSIS. FOR POTENTIAL TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL DEMAND FOR GRAD. GRADUATES OF THE PROGRAM. AND IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH AN ANNOUNCES WE'VE TURNED TO ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE WHICH SUGGEST THAT THE MARKET FOR FIREFIGHTERS IS VERY COMPETITIVE AND THAT THERE ARE SOME SUBSTANTIAL BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT. FOR THOSE WITH FELONY RECORDS. MOVING ON WE THINK THAT THE PROGRAM IS QUITE EXPENSIVE RELATIVE TO OTHER RECIDIVISM REDUCTION INTERVENTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE SAME ANNUAL COST OF THE PROGRAM CCR COULD INSTEAD PROVIDE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY WHICH IS AN INTERVENTION THAT'S BEEN FOUND ELSEWHERE TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM. TO OF OVER FIVE THOUSAND INMATES ANNUALLY. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THAT PROPOSED LARGE UP FRONT CAPITAL OUTLAY INVESTMENT FOR A PROGRAM THAT APPEARS TO BE UNLIKELY TO BE EFFECTIVE AND HAS NOT BEEN TESTED VIA PILOT. I HAVE FURTHER MORE IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER ALL OF THE REQUESTED RESOURCES WOULD BE NEEDED GIVEN THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A PROVIDED FIRM PLANS ON SEVERAL OF THE DETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL. AND FINALLY WE NOTE THAT THERE ARE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO TRAIN THE TWENTY NINE PEARL E. CONSERVATION CORPS MEMBERS THAT DON'T REQUIRE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM. SO WE RECOMMEND REJECTING AND TO THE EXTENT THE LEGISLATURE'S INTERESTED IN. REDUCING RECIDIVISM I COULD REDIRECT SOME OR ALL OF THE REQUESTED RESOURCES TO. SUPPORT EVIDENCE BASED REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING. ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS. YEAH LISTA JONES SAWYER I'M. YOU KNOW MOSTLY A PROGRAM AFTER IN A. HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT. DECADE ON WITH PROP 47-57 PROBABLY WILL BE NEW. AN UNTESTED NAM AND HOPING THAT IT WILL BE NEW. AND UNTESTED BECAUSE. THAT'S TWO WAY WE NEED TO GO BUT THE OTHER THING IS. THE CONSERVATION CORPS WHEN I WORKED WITH STEVE LOS ANGELES I WAS THE LANDLORD WHEN THEY WERE ON THEIR STILL ARE A MAIN STREET AND I KNOW THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE. AND YOU PROBABLY GET SOME DATA. FROM THE CONVERSATION COR THEIR SUCCESS. WITH YOUNG PEOPLE. IN MY DISTRICT AND CLEAN UP NEIGHBORHOODS ALLEYS AND THINGS THAT NATURE. MY COUSIN WAS IN A CONSERVATION CORPS. AND JUST RECENTLY RETIRED FROM THE C. LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT. AS TOM. NINE ONE ONE OPERATOR. AND SHE WOULD TELL YOU WHO WON FOR CONSERVATION CORPS. OF. DIRECTING HER IN A MORE POSITIVE WAY. SHE WOULD HAVE SPENT THE LAST. OF THIRTY SIX YEARS OF HER LIFE NAM. WORKING FOUR LAPD AND MOST PRODUCTIVE WAY. AND SO I. I DO BELIEVE IN IT I'VE HAD SEVERAL BILLS THAT WILL ATTEST TO IT. I DO BELIEVE THE GOVERNOR AND FINANCE EVERYBODY'S APPS YOU'RE RIGHT WE DO NEED TO SET UP SOME MEASURES. SIR WE CAN TELL WHETHER NOT THE PROGRAM IS WORKING. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE NAM HELLFIRE LA WITH THEM CONSERVATION CORPS TO DEVELOP THOSE METRICS IT IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. ON NOT ONLY. TO THIS COMMITTEE BUT ESPECIALLY TO ME. TO LOOK AT ALL OF THE RISK RECIDIVISM PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE BEEN TTC OUR AND OTHERS AND WE START MEASURING. EFFECTIVENESS OF ALL THAT. ON EXCITE WE PROBABLY NEED TO DO A LOT OF FUN AND. ALSO BELIEVE WE NEED TO PROBABLY GIVE EXTRA MONEY SO WE HAVE TO HIRE PEOPLE TO DO THE AUDITS BOGAN DO. SOME ON TIME IN REAL TIME. EVALUATION SEEK TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS YOU GO ALONG. SO I I. I HOPE WE JUST DON'T ABANDON THIS IDEA BECAUSE. OF I DO BELIEVE THAT THE SKILL SET THAT YOU GET. IN THIS TYPE OF TRAINING. NOT ONLY COULD LEAD YOU INTO. BECOME A FIREFIGHTER BUT PREVIOUS SKILL SET TO LEAD YOU TO OTHER OCCUPATIONS NOT JUST. I'M GOING INTO FIREFIGHTING OF. BUT AT THE THE OLD CONCEPT OF. BEING ABLE TO GET UP ON TIME SHOW UP TO WORK ON TIME SHINE YOUR SHOES. GET DRESSED PUT UNIFORM ON SHOW UP BE POLITE. TAKE CONSTRUCTION. THAT IS JUST AS VALUABLE. AS ANYTHING ELSE AND I'VE SEEN IT WITH THE CONSERVATION CORPS MISSILES LIKE THAT WOULD BE THE CORE OF THIS PROGRAM. BECAUSE A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE OF WHETHER THEY'RE LOW RISK HIGH RISK THAT'S WHAT THEY NEED. THEY NEED THAT KIND OF A TRAINING TO MAKE THEM A MORE PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS SO I. I HOPE. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY. A GROUP OF FINANCE AND HOPEFULLY THAT WE. MOVE FORWARD TO COME TOGETHER. PUT IN THOSE MATRIX THAT I THINK THEY'RE VERY VERY THAT IT'S VALID. ABSOLUTELY WE NEED TO TO HAVE THOSE BECAUSE I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN YOU FINISH AFTER ONE YEAR FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS. I WILL BE HERE TEN YEARS FROM NOW BUT SOMEBODY ELSE WILL BE SITTING HERE AND THEY WILL LOOK AT BILLS MATRIX AND SAID I'M GLAD THEY PUT GO THEN. BECAUSE NOW WE SEE THE VALUE OF IT AND WE CAN QUANTIFY THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT. HAVE NOT RECEIVED A BAITED THE DELTA NUMBER YOUNG PEOPLE THAT WE SAVED FAMILIES THAT WE KEPT GATHER AND WE CAN ULTIMATELY QUANTIFIED AND SO I. I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT WE DON'T STOP HERE THAT WE FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MOVE FORWARD. IN A PERMITS. THANK YOU THOSE VALUES THAT YOU ENUMERATED WOULD ALSO BE OF VALUE I THINK IN THE LEGISLATURE. I THINK YOU'RE MAKING THE LA A NERVOUS WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT ADDING MORE. TO. A PROJECT LIKE THIS BUT IT BUT I THINK. WE KNOW HOW TO DO THE FIRE CAMPS WE KNOW THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CDC ARE AND AND FIRE AND WE ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND THE VALUE OF THE SEAS AND WHAT. WHAT GETS PROVIDED? BUT I I THINK SOME OF THIS IS IS. WHICH I UNDERSTAND BANG FOR THE BUCK HERE IF YOU WELL AND. HOW MANY PEOPLE BEING SERVED HERE WHICH OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY AT RISK OR NOT? BECAUSE AS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT. WHERE WE WANNA PUT I RAGS WHAT BASKET AND HOW WE CAN IMPROVE THE OVERALL SYSTEM? FALLING BACK ON THINGS THAT WE SORT OF KNOW IT SORT OF UNDERSTANDS. IT IS COMFORTING BUT MAYBE NOT ANSWERING ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ANSWER AND THAT'S KIND OF HOW I TO. KELLY OWES COMMENTS HERE IS IT'S UNCLEAR HOW MANY PEOPLE WE BE REACHING. HOW HOW EFFECTIVE THIS IS GONNA BE VERSUS OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT THAT WE COULD WE COULD BE MAKING FOR ESPECIALLY HIGH RISK POPULATIONS BECAUSE WE DON'T ALWAYS DO A VERY GOOD JOB? WITH A HIGH RISK POPULATIONS AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY AS A CDC ARE. TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM ACROSS THE BOARD TO START TO MOVE PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE PRISON SYSTEM AND LOOK FOR OTHER ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE. GOOD FOR OUR COMMUNITIES BOTH FROM PUBLIC SAFETY STANDPOINT BUT ALSO FOR THOSE WHO ARE RETURNING FROM THE PRISON SYSTEM AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE PUTTING THEM TO WORK TO GET IN THE HOUSE PUTTING. GETTING THAT GIVING THEM ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE THAT WE CAN HAVE AND SO IT'S HARD SOMETIMES TO LOOK AT A PROPOSAL LIKE THIS IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE THINGS BECAUSE WE DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW. ALL OTHER EFFECTS AND IF WE COME UP WITH A BETTER WAY OF WERE OF EVALUATING UP A PROJECT LIKE THAT'S. HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE SERVING AS OPPOSED UNDER PROGRAM LIKE THIS IN WHERE WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PUTTING OUR INVESTMENTS? THAT SEE THE RESULT THAT WE WOULD BE LOOKING FOR. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN WOULD BE INTERESTED IN IN THIS CONTEXT. SO AND THERE'S NOTHING ABOUT HELLFIRE THE SEAS OR OR THAT. WHAT THIS PROGRAM REPRESENTS I THINK THAT IS THE PROBLEM? IT'S HOW WE EVALUATE THIS ON THE BIGGER PICTURE AND UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT IT REPRESENTS TO US AND THAT IT'S MOVING US IN IN THE DIRECTION THAT WE ULTIMATELY NEED TO GO ON THAT THOSE ARE SORT OF THE NATURE OF THE. BUT THE QUESTION. NOW. YOU SAID YOU HAD A WIDOW OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN THROUGH THE PROGRAM. THOUSAND RELEASES FROM FAR THE WHO HAD BEEN THROUGH THE FIRE CAMP WHO WERE RELEASED IN THAT SIX MONTH PERIOD YEAH SO ABOUT THE. AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA ON THEM. WITH REGARDS TO THEM GETTING JOBS OR. WE. AND FATIGUE TO YOUR POINT INTO INTIMATE MISTER SOUNDS POINT AS WELL AND AND MISTER JONES SAWYER. WE WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF THE DURATION OF THE PROGRAM THE EIGHTEEN MONTHS. THAT. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COMING OUT WHO HAVE A PLACE TO GO WHO'D BEEN IN THE PGA IN IN THE CHEESE FIRE PROGRAM WHO HAVE A PLACE TO GO STABLE HOUSING ALREADY HAVE A JOB A PROBABLY NOT GOING TO COMMIT TO AN EIGHTEEN MONTH PROGRAM. SO. WHAT WE'RE ANTICIPATING AT LEAST ON THE PURL SIDE IS THAT MANY OF THOSE WHO DO COMMIT TED AYE EIGHTEENTH MONTH EIGHTEEN MONTH PROGRAM ARE PROBABLY CAN BE THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE? CONCRETE HOUSING THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING. YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT THE SOUTHERN REGION INITIALLY TO POPULATED FROM THOUGH SOUTHERN COUNTIES. THAT TENDS TO BE THE HIGHER RISK AND OF THE END OF THE SPIRIT THAT SPECTRUM BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE. HOMELESS OR THEIR CALLOUS CHIRPING THINGS LIKE THAT. ARM WE CAN GET JUST ABOUT ANY SORT OF. INFORMATION FROM THOSE THOUSAND THAT THAT THAT LAUGHED NAM AS TO HOW MANY LEFT IN OUR YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT IN STABLE HOUSING HOW MANY GOT HIM WILL GOT EMPLOYMENT WITHIN SIX MONTHS THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WE CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THIS PROCESS IT WOULD DIFFICULT TO GO MUCH BEYOND THOSE NUMBERS THAT I GOT YOU THERE. I THINK THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. IF WE HAD. SOME DATA WITH REGARD TO I MEAN I THINK MOST OF US HAVE A SENSE OF THAT IT. PROBABLY IS A PROGRAM THAT WORKS WITHIN THAT IS AS AS WAS JUST DON'T POINT OUT WHERE THAT IT'S A PROGRAM WITH THEM. GREATEST AMOUNT OF BANG FOR THE BUCK COULD NOT. IS IS WHAT BECOMES THE ISSUE AND OBVIOUSLY WITHOUT A WHOLE LOT OF DATA IT BECOMES. EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO OUT DO THAT IT IN THE REPORT THERE WAS ALSO SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT AND I KNOW YOU GAVE US A LIST OF OTHER. RELATED OPPORTUNITIES WHICH IS WHAT. MISTER JONES SAWYER WAS MAKING REFERENCE TO. AND THAT'S A GOOD THING IS IT. THE QUESTION BECOMES IS THERE DEMAND I THINK THAT WAS THE OTHER QUESTION IS THEIR DEMAND FOR. FOR FOLKS IN THIS FIELD LE WE KNOW THAT. ANY TIME THERE'S A. POSITIONS OPEN IN CITIES PARTICULARLY FOR FIREFIGHTERS LIST IS ENORMOUSLY LONG. AND. AND SO EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE A FIREFIGHTER AND. YOU KNOW AND AS A RESULT YOU HAVE LOTS TO CHOOSE FROM. AND IT'S A DIFFICULT PROCESS SO. QUESTION IS WOULD BE SWEET FOLKS BE. HIGHLY VALUED OR EASY TO PLACE OR WHATEVER ONES ONCE THEY'RE FINISHED SO THE. ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT THE COMPETITION FOR FIREFIGHTING JOBS. AT ALL LEVELS. AT WHETHER IT'S THE STATE FOR OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT FIRE DEPARTMENTS AROUND CALVET THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF COMPETITION. THE BAR IS HIGH TO ACHIEVE THAT BECAUSE OF THAT AND. THE GOVERNOR'S BEEN VERY LOUD AND CLEAR THAT WITH WHAT'S TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPETE. IT'S REALLY THE ONUS THOUGH IS ON THE PARTICIPANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE WILL PROVIDE THE TOOLS FOR THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL BUT WHEN THEY LEAVE THIS EIGHTEEN MONTH PROGRAM. THEY'VE GOT TO INTERVIEW THEY'VE GOT TO EXCEL ABOVE AND BEYOND. THERE THEIR COMPETITION TO BE SUCCESSFUL FOR THESE JOBS THE ART AUTOMATIC GOING TO BE GIVEN. OF THESE JOB OPPORTUNITIES IN THE INTERIM I THINK IT WAS PROVIDED YES THERE'S MANY MANY OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY CAN BE WORKING ON. ALONG THE WAY AS THEY COMPETE FOR FIREFIGHTING JOBS ARE EVEN BEGIN FIREFIGHTING JOBS WITH THE FOREST SERVICE AND MANY OTHER A SEASONAL AND PERMANENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY CONTINUE TO GAIN EXPERIENCE.
