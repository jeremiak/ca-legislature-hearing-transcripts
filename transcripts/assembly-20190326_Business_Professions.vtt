00:35:05.002 --> 00:35:06.070
VARIETY OF OTHER PROFESSIONS BUT

00:35:06.137 --> 00:35:06.804
SPECIFICALLY.

00:35:06.871 --> 00:35:07.438
RIGHT NOW IN THE MEDICAL FIELD

00:35:07.505 --> 00:35:08.539
BUT I KNOW THAT THERE'S MANY

00:35:08.606 --> 00:35:12.109
MORE THAT WE CAN LOOK AT AND YOU

00:35:12.176 --> 00:35:13.678
KNOW CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE.

00:35:13.744 --> 00:35:14.879
THOSE FOLKS CAN COME IN AND JUST

00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:16.080
BE YOU KNOW WHATEVER IT TAKES

00:35:16.147 --> 00:35:18.149
BUT MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO

00:35:18.216 --> 00:35:20.051
APPLY AS OPPOSED TO ALL OF THESE

00:35:20.117 --> 00:35:20.718
YOU KNOW DIFFERENT.

00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:21.853
SOME OF THEM HAVE TO START ALL

00:35:21.919 --> 00:35:23.154
OVER AND GO TO SCHOOL YOU KNOW

00:35:23.221 --> 00:35:25.056
FOR ANOTHER THREE FOUR YEARS AND

00:35:25.122 --> 00:35:25.990
THEY'VE ALREADY.

00:35:26.057 --> 00:35:27.458
COMPLETED THAT EDUCATION IN

00:35:27.525 --> 00:35:28.960
THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES AND

00:35:29.026 --> 00:35:30.928
SO I'M HOPING TO LOOK AT A

00:35:30.995 --> 00:35:32.063
SIMPLER SYSTEM INSTEAD OF

00:35:32.129 --> 00:35:33.664
SENDING THEM ALL BACK TO SCHOOL

00:35:33.731 --> 00:35:35.399

00:35:37.435 --> 00:35:39.337
DO THEY NEED US -- RIGHT THEY TO

00:35:39.403 --> 00:35:40.438
START ALL OVER BY BUT THOSE ARE

00:35:40.505 --> 00:35:41.339
SOME OF THE EXAMPLES THAT I'M

00:35:41.405 --> 00:35:43.241
LOOKING AT SPECIFICALLY LIKE I

00:35:43.307 --> 00:35:43.808
SAID.

00:35:43.875 --> 00:35:47.378
I HAVE A A DOCTOR WHO WHO HAS TO

BARRIERS AND WITH THE NURSING

00:35:48.846 --> 00:35:51.015
SHORTAGE I THINK IT WOULD BE

00:35:51.082 --> 00:35:58.089
IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THOSE --

SUBSTANCE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE

OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY HERE

00:39:28.032 --> 00:39:30.134
AFTER THE COMPASSIONATE USE ACT

00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:32.503
PASSED -- THERE WAS A STRONG

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.472
DEMAND FOR HAVING BETTER

00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:36.607
RESEARCH REGARDING THE POTENTIAL.

00:39:36.674 --> 00:39:37.875
MEDICINAL BENEFITS ARE NOT OF

00:39:37.942 --> 00:39:39.443
CANNABIS SO WE RECEIVED FUNDING

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:40.644
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND WE

00:39:40.711 --> 00:39:41.846
CONDUCTED A NUMBER OF CLINICAL

00:39:41.912 --> 00:39:44.348
TRIALS -- SEVEN LOOKING OUT

00:39:44.415 --> 00:39:46.350
SMOKED CANNABIS WERE VAPORIZED.

00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:47.284
AND OVER THE YEARS WE'VE

00:39:47.351 --> 00:39:48.853
MAINTAINED -- PRETTY STRONG

00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:50.721
RESEARCH PORTFOLIO FUNDED BY

00:39:50.788 --> 00:39:52.990
NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH

00:39:53.057 --> 00:39:53.924
FUNDED BY PHILANTHROPY AS WELL

00:39:53.991 --> 00:39:55.092
AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BEEN

00:39:55.159 --> 00:39:56.026
DOING SOME STUDIES ON IMPAIRED

00:39:56.093 --> 00:40:00.197
DRIVNG AS WELL RELATED TO KIND

00:40:00.264 --> 00:40:01.432
OF THIS.

00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:02.399
THE REASON THIS BILL IS

00:40:02.466 --> 00:40:03.434
IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE WHAT WAS IN

00:40:03.501 --> 00:40:05.202
VISION TWENTY YEARS AGO -- IS

00:40:05.269 --> 00:40:06.303
NOT COMPLETELY COME TO FRUITION

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:07.238
WE ARE NOW TO PLACE WHERE THE

00:40:07.304 --> 00:40:08.005
UNIVERSE MISSISSIPPI STILL IS

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:09.607
THE ONLY SOURCE OF PLANT

00:40:09.673 --> 00:40:10.374
MATERIAL.

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:11.876
AND THEY OF FAIRLY LIMITED

00:40:11.942 --> 00:40:14.211
RESOURCES IN TERMS OF CREATING

00:40:14.278 --> 00:40:15.212
THE TYPES OF CANVAS THAT OUR

00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:17.281
PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY USING --

00:40:17.348 --> 00:40:19.650
WHAT THE VARIOUS CONSTITUENTS OF

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:22.186
KIND OF A DOLLAR CBT AND TO SEE

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:24.789
THAT WE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN --

00:40:24.855 --> 00:40:25.623
THE D. A. AS ANNOUNCED THAT THEY

00:40:25.689 --> 00:40:26.123
WOULD OPEN IT UP TO MORE

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:27.825
MANUFACTURERS -- BUT SINCE

00:40:27.892 --> 00:40:30.127
AUGUST TWENTY SIXTEEN NONE HAVE

00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:30.694
BEEN APPROVED OR EVEN HEARD

00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:31.629
FEEDBACK.

00:40:31.695 --> 00:40:32.997
SO WE WOULD LIKE TO POSITION THE

00:40:33.063 --> 00:40:34.331
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO BE IN A

00:40:34.398 --> 00:40:35.699
POSITION.

00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:37.368
TO CULTIVATE CANNABIS THAT COULD

00:40:37.434 --> 00:40:40.004
BE USEFUL FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.906
IN THIS CASE THE C. M. C. R. WE

00:40:41.972 --> 00:40:43.174
ARE NOT CLASS SIZE EXPERTS SO WE

00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.575
WOULD COLLABORATE WITH

00:40:44.642 --> 00:40:46.944
INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS UC DAVIS.

00:40:47.011 --> 00:40:49.446
AND IDENTIFYING THE BEST METHOD

00:40:49.513 --> 00:40:51.348
FOR GROWING CANNABIS -- THE

00:40:51.415 --> 00:40:52.416
OTHER KEY ASPECT OF THIS OF THIS

00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:54.518
BILL IS THAT IT BROADENS THE

00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:55.786
SCOPE OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

00:40:55.853 --> 00:40:58.989
SO IN ADDITION TO CANNABIS.

00:40:59.056 --> 00:41:00.825
CANNABINOIDS LIKE C. V. D. MIGHT

00:41:00.891 --> 00:41:02.793
BE USEFUL FOR CERTAIN CONDITIONS --

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:06.130
BUT CURRENTLY -- QUITE OFTEN THE

00:41:06.197 --> 00:41:07.865
CVT YOU GET FROM DIED INCLUDES

00:41:07.932 --> 00:41:08.899
TEACH YOU SO IF YOU WANT TO LOOK

NOT WANT TO GET THEM HIGH.

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:13.771
AND ARE GOOD SOURCES RIGHT NOW

00:41:13.838 --> 00:41:17.575
OF CBT WITHOUT THE PSYCHOACTIVE

00:41:17.641 --> 00:41:20.344

NARROW THIS BUT I GUESS I WAS

00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:22.993
WONDERING HOW BIG A PROBLEM THIS

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.361
IS IS IT JUST A SAN DIEGO

00:49:24.428 --> 00:49:25.896
PROBLEM OR IS IT A STATE WIDE

00:49:25.962 --> 00:49:28.231
ISSUE I HAD A SITUATION ONCE

00:49:28.298 --> 00:49:31.101
WHERE A A JIM TRY TO TELL ME I

00:49:31.168 --> 00:49:31.702

IN DOING THIS OR IS THIS JUST AS

00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:52.389
SMALL SAN DIEGO ISSUE WHERE THEY

00:49:52.456 --> 00:49:53.490
