PORTION OF FUNCTIONAL BUT BUT

00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:26.378
IN IN THE OVERALL CONTEXT IT'S

00:27:26.444 --> 00:27:28.380
A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF REMAINING

FUNCTION IS LEFT TO DO AND WE

00:27:30.181 --> 00:27:30.749

ACCOUNTING AND MISS THE STATE

00:28:42.754 --> 00:28:44.122
HAD DONE A CAPPING AWAIT THE

00:28:44.189 --> 00:28:44.689
WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE

00:28:44.756 --> 00:28:46.524
REST OF THE WORLD. I'M NOT A

00:28:46.591 --> 00:28:47.959
COUNTY- BUT WE HAVE THOSE

00:28:48.026 --> 00:28:51.129
PEOPLE ARE. THEY CAN. YOU THE-

00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:52.297
GRANULAR LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT

00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:55.033
YOU MAY WISH TO UNDERSTAND BUT

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.735
IT IT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE

00:28:57.802 --> 00:28:59.104
WAY ARE COUNTING WORKFORCE

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:01.406
WORKED AND WAS ABLE TO TALK TO

00:29:01.473 --> 00:29:03.908
THEM SOMETHING UP BEFORE THAT

00:29:03.975 --> 00:29:05.810
IN HINDSIGHT WITH THE BENEFIT

00:29:05.877 --> 00:29:08.012
OF HINDSIGHT SHOULD HAVE DONE

00:29:08.079 --> 00:29:10.381
MORE AND CHANGE. FOR WE

00:29:10.448 --> 00:29:14.052
RECOGNIZE. AND WE'RE STILL

00:29:14.119 --> 00:29:14.953
TAKEN SOME FOR THAT BUT WITH

00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:16.921
THE LEGISLATURE SUPPORT WE

00:29:16.988 --> 00:29:18.189
WE'RE DEPLOYING. AS IN THOSE

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:19.858
RESOURCES THE VA'S. ARE AT THE

00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:21.326
PART COUNTY SHOPS OR TO SOME

00:29:21.392 --> 00:29:23.361
DEPARTMENT COUNTERTOPS SO IT'S

00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:24.629
NOT JUST ABOUT FISCAL WITH THIS

00:29:24.696 --> 00:29:27.031
GIRL DOES A PROVIDES A LEVEL

00:29:27.098 --> 00:29:28.733
TRANSPARENCY THE STATE'S NEVER

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.569
HAD BEFORE WHERE OKAY TO. IT'S

00:29:31.636 --> 00:29:32.537
FUN TO GO TO THE PARK. MONEY

00:29:32.604 --> 00:29:33.638
BROKEN OUT IN THE DEPARTMENT.

00:29:33.705 --> 00:29:35.673
USE THAT MONEY AND ON THE TGS

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.176
INTO THE PRODUCT. OKAY NOW SEE

00:29:38.243 --> 00:29:39.144
HOW THEY'RE SPENDING NOW IN

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.612
WHAT VENDORS AND WHEN WHAT

00:29:40.678 --> 00:29:42.947
THEY'RE BUYING AND SO. WE THINK

00:29:43.014 --> 00:29:45.150
ALL THAT IS A VITAL STATE.

00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:45.717
TRANSPARENCY CREATED A WORK.

00:29:45.783 --> 00:29:46.818
MEANS THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE

00:29:46.885 --> 00:29:48.419
BEFORE. AND THAT'S THE PIECE

00:29:48.486 --> 00:29:51.089
WITH WE'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH

00:29:51.156 --> 00:29:52.624
NOW. WE THINK WE'RE GETTING

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:56.261
AHEAD OF IT. US TO DO AND-

00:29:56.327 --> 00:29:58.029
QUESTION I DID I DRESS ALTER

00:29:58.096 --> 00:29:59.230
YOUR QUESTIONS MANAGER I

00:29:59.297 --> 00:30:02.467
BELIEVE THAT AND I THE ISSUE OF

00:30:02.534 --> 00:30:06.871
THE I MEAN I GUESS WHAT I HEAR

00:30:06.938 --> 00:30:10.475
YOU SAYING IS THAT IS IT'S

00:30:10.542 --> 00:30:15.013
CLEAR. THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR

00:30:15.079 --> 00:30:17.348
FROM THE PROJECT IS ALMOST

00:30:17.415 --> 00:30:19.918
COMPLETE. AND THAT THERE ARE

00:30:19.984 --> 00:30:22.420
FEW TASKS LEFT THAT WILL BE

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:24.589
DONE BY THE JUNE. THIRTY AT

00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:28.459
TWENTY TWENTY DATE. F. BUT IT

00:30:28.526 --> 00:30:29.561
BECAUSE BECAUSE WHAT I HEAR

00:30:29.627 --> 00:30:31.362
WHEN I HEAR THE LA- SAYING IS

00:30:31.429 --> 00:30:35.066
THAT IS. THIS MAY BE

00:30:35.133 --> 00:30:37.368
PERSPECTIVE- MAYBE I SHOULD ASK

00:30:37.435 --> 00:30:40.672
WHETHER THAT NEW IF THE NEW

00:30:40.738 --> 00:30:42.874
THAT THE INTEREST IN HAVING

00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:45.743
LATE. DEAFENED DEFINITION- OF

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:48.346
END OF PROJECT- WOULD BE

00:30:48.413 --> 00:30:52.884
PERSPECTIVE. BRENT METZ CURLY

00:30:52.951 --> 00:30:53.818
YES SO THE DEFINITION OF

00:30:53.885 --> 00:30:55.853
PROJECT COMPLETION THAT WE ARE

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.356
RECOMMENDING WOULD TAKE INTO

00:30:58.423 --> 00:30:59.691
ACCOUNT SOME OF THE SCOPE THAT

00:30:59.757 --> 00:31:01.693
WAS REMOVED WITH S. P. R.

00:31:01.759 --> 00:31:04.395
EIGHT- EIGHT AND WOULD LOOK AT.

00:31:04.462 --> 00:31:08.733
ALL THE WHAT WE FIND WITH IT

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.867
EIGHT AS KIND OF PROJECT

00:31:09.934 --> 00:31:13.338
COMPLETION IT WAS A THERE WAS A

00:31:13.404 --> 00:31:16.174
TO USE THAN AMONG. BACK IN ALL

00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:18.209
JUST THAT WE- LEGISLATIVE. THE

00:31:18.276 --> 00:31:20.612
ALTERNATE WE DO AND A BENCH BY

00:31:20.678 --> 00:31:23.147
THE TO THERE ISN'T IT DELAY IN

00:31:23.214 --> 00:31:24.449
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE

00:31:24.515 --> 00:31:26.784
ANTICIPATED TO BE DONE BY JUNE

00:31:26.851 --> 00:31:28.553
THIRTIETH BUT WE ALSO SEE YOU

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.222
THERE SOME IN EXAMPLE.

00:31:31.289 --> 00:31:32.824
INITIALLY DEFINED TEN TO

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:35.860
INCLUDE AN OF A- YOU. FINANCE

00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:37.562
THE FISCAL. BECAUSE THEN THAT

00:31:37.629 --> 00:31:39.831
WOULD AT LEAST GIVE US SOME

00:31:39.897 --> 00:31:40.565
CONFIDENCE THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE

00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:42.267
DATA IS BEING SHARED BETWEEN

00:31:42.333 --> 00:31:44.502
THE FISCAL STIMULUS SYSTEM AND

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:46.371
WOULD GIVE US MORE CONFIDENCE

00:31:46.437 --> 00:31:49.807
THAT WE CAN PRODUCE ACT SHOULD

00:31:49.874 --> 00:31:51.743
ACCURATE FIND TO REPORTS STAT

00:31:51.809 --> 00:31:54.712
GREAT SOLUTION IS DEPLOYED I'M

00:31:54.779 --> 00:31:57.015
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT

00:31:57.081 --> 00:32:00.118
COULD BE DETERRED SUCH AS THE-

00:32:00.184 --> 00:32:02.854
OF THE FUR DEPARTMENTS THAT'S

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:08.126
ALREADY. BACK ON HOW MANY HAVE

00:32:08.192 --> 00:32:08.993
BEEN DE COMMISSIONED WHAT THE

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.297
SAVINGS WERE THEIR NUMBER WAYS

00:32:12.363 --> 00:32:12.930
THAT THIS COULD BE DONE BUT FOR

00:32:12.997 --> 00:32:15.466
US- RECOMMENDATION WAS TO FOCUS.

00:32:15.533 --> 00:32:17.368
WHAT THE LEGISLATURE INTO WHEN

00:32:17.435 --> 00:32:18.002
IT LOOKED AT THIS PROJECT

00:32:18.069 --> 00:32:21.005
INITIALLY AND WHERE WE ARE NOW

00:32:21.072 --> 00:32:23.541
AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME

00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:24.475
DISCREPANCIES THERE BETWEEN THE

00:32:24.542 --> 00:32:28.613
TWO. OKAY WE ARE WE ARE ARE

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.082
WORKING WITH WITH YOUR STAFF

00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:34.218
AND AS WELL AS- CDT AND THE L.

00:32:34.285 --> 00:32:36.721
L. TO COME TO A DEFINITION OF

00:32:36.788 --> 00:32:39.357
WHAT BUT AS WE WERE WITH JUST A

00:32:39.424 --> 00:32:41.526
POINT OF CLARIFICATION ON

00:32:41.592 --> 00:32:42.894
SOMETHING THAT YOU STEP USE

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.197
YOU'D STATE. I JULY. TWENTY ALL

00:32:46.264 --> 00:32:47.832
OF THE REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY

00:32:47.899 --> 00:32:51.102
AND- FOR THE CONSOLIDATED CASH

00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:53.171
RECORD COMING OVER AND INTO THE

00:32:53.237 --> 00:32:54.272
INTO THE FISCAL SYSTEM FROM THE

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:56.274
COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WHAT WILL

00:32:56.341 --> 00:32:59.410
BE LEFT IN THE P. SAID IT'S

00:32:59.477 --> 00:33:02.680
BEING DELAYED FURTHER IT IS THE

00:33:02.747 --> 00:33:05.450
KEY. THE EXTENSION THAT THE TO

00:33:05.516 --> 00:33:07.652
BE DEVELOPED IN ORDER TO

00:33:07.719 --> 00:33:10.021
PRODUCE THE KAFFIR BY THAT THE

00:33:10.088 --> 00:33:11.823
STATE COMPTROLLER WE'RE LOOKING

00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:13.891
AT ABOUT SIX MONTHS RIGHT NOW

00:33:13.958 --> 00:33:15.760
AS FAR AS BLAISE BUT I'VE ASKED

00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:18.262
MY FROM WERE PRIMED AND NOT AND

00:33:18.329 --> 00:33:19.330
WE'RE STILL BUILDING THE

00:33:19.397 --> 00:33:23.768
SCHEDULE SO I DON'T HAVE A

00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:28.673

THE STATE AND ITS CITIZENS.

00:49:06.410 --> 00:49:08.445
TIME FOR MANY THINGS TO NOT BE

00:49:08.512 --> 00:49:10.347
TOLERATED WHAT ARE THE

00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:13.984
CONSEQUENCES IF THEN THE AGENCY

00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:17.954
THAT DOES HAVE THE ABILITY. TO

00:49:18.021 --> 00:49:20.290
SEE THAT THAT EXPERT IF THEY

00:49:20.357 --> 00:49:22.059
DON'T DO THAT AND THEY CONTINUE

00:49:22.125 --> 00:49:24.494
TO NEGLECT WHAT PENALTY DOES

00:49:24.561 --> 00:49:29.066
ANY STATE AGENCY PAY IN A WAY.

00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:30.367

00:50:06.236 --> 00:50:07.838

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:42.539
GOVERNMENT. TO THE LARGER THAN

MUCH FOR THE CLARIFICATION BUT

00:50:45.242 --> 00:50:46.910
THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE DON'T

00:50:46.977 --> 00:50:49.379
HAVE A CONSEQUENCES. AND THERE

00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:51.248
ARE IT'S ALL MORE IMPORTANT NOW

WITH THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET. I

00:51:09.099 --> 00:51:10.834
AM GOING TO SUGGEST THAT WE

00:51:10.901 --> 00:51:13.770
WORK TOGETHER WITH ANALYST.

00:51:13.837 --> 00:51:16.072

LIMITING THE LANGUAGE. DEFINING

00:51:22.112 --> 00:51:24.381
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. WHAT

00:51:24.448 --> 00:51:27.484
WILL GET DONE AND IN FACT WHAT

00:51:27.551 --> 00:51:31.354
CONSEQUENCES ARE. AND FURTHER

00:51:31.421 --> 00:51:33.857
THAT WE INCORPORATE COST

00:51:33.924 --> 00:51:36.526

OR WHAT EFFICIENCIES WILL BE

00:51:49.372 --> 00:51:51.141
WROUGHT BY THAT. WHY BEING

00:51:51.208 --> 00:51:52.843

AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:53:28.405 --> 00:53:30.807
PEOPLE SORT OF USE THAT FOR

00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:34.544
SOME OF US COME LATER IS WHAT

00:53:34.611 --> 00:53:36.446
WAS THE INTENTION AND AS MUCH

00:53:36.513 --> 00:53:39.282
AS POSSIBLE. RIGHT WHAT A

00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:41.084
SPECIFIC AND I IMAGINE THAT A

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:43.153
LOT OF IT WAS NOT SPECIFIC IT

00:53:43.219 --> 00:53:45.288
WAS JUST LIKE OKAY GO DO AND

00:53:45.355 --> 00:53:47.057
THEN YOU START DOING THAT THEN

00:53:47.123 --> 00:53:50.327
YOU FIGURE OUT THAT THERE IS A

00:53:50.393 --> 00:53:51.895
LOT MORE TO IT BUT- MUCH AS YOU

00:53:51.962 --> 00:53:53.330
CAN. THIS UNDERSTOOD. WHAT THE

00:53:53.396 --> 00:53:56.266
AND WAS AND- AS MUCH AS

00:53:56.333 --> 00:53:58.735
POSSIBLE WAS A TIME FRAME. UP

00:53:58.802 --> 00:53:59.936
IN A SHORT SUMMARY BECAUSE I

00:54:00.003 --> 00:54:02.572
SORT OF LOSE THAT IN THE MIDDLE

00:54:02.639 --> 00:54:05.775
OF A OF A LOT OF THINGS. I'M I

00:54:05.842 --> 00:54:08.211
KNOW. FIRST YEAR WHEN THE ISSUE

00:54:08.278 --> 00:54:11.214
CAME UP OF COST SAVINGS. OF IT

00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:13.249
WAS A IT WAS A REAL QUESTION

00:54:13.316 --> 00:54:15.352
MARK BECAUSE WE WERE- EITHER

00:54:15.418 --> 00:54:16.753

00:54:21.858 --> 00:54:27.597
THE PROCESS OF BEING EMPLOYED.

00:54:27.664 --> 00:54:29.966
YOU KNOW WE QUESTIONED WAS THIS

00:54:30.033 --> 00:54:33.503
A TEMPORARY BECAUSE OF THE NEED

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:36.573
TO TRAIN BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:38.908
CHANGE THE CULTURE WHICH I

00:54:38.975 --> 00:54:40.610
UNDERSTAND WAS OF A BIG ISSUE

00:54:40.677 --> 00:54:43.380
OF SO I DON'T THINK WE CAME UP

00:54:43.446 --> 00:54:47.417

00:54:47.484 --> 00:54:50.520

PARTICULAR PROJECT VERY- THOUGH

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:05.134
IT WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN TWENTY

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.535
EIGHT OR SO IT IS A HISTORIC

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:09.138
BUILDING- AND DISCOVER THE-

INCLUDING LACK OF FIRE

01:10:13.175 --> 01:10:14.910
SPRINKLERS. BUILDING IS

01:10:14.977 --> 01:10:17.012
MISSING- SUFFICIENT EXITING

01:10:17.079 --> 01:10:19.882
STAIRS- IT IS ALSO TRUE PLEASE

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:21.250
BUILDING SYSTEMS THAT WOULD BE

01:10:21.317 --> 01:10:24.286
ELEVATORS PLUMBING CIRCLE UNTIL.

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:27.122

ANTICIPATING OF AND NOTING THAT

01:11:04.293 --> 01:11:05.427
THE LA DOES RECOMMEND OR

01:11:05.494 --> 01:11:08.263
COMMENTS IN THE- IN THE AGENDA

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:09.932
WANTED TO JUST TALK A LITTLE

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:12.368
BIT ABOUT- THE COST FOR THE

01:11:12.434 --> 01:11:13.636
PROJECT IT IS TRUE THAT-

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:16.205
COMPARED. TO NISHA ASSUMPTIONS

01:11:16.271 --> 01:11:17.206
WITH PROJECT FOR LEGISLATURE IN

01:11:17.272 --> 01:11:18.374
THE FIRST PLACE COSTS HAVE

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.975
GONE- THEIR NUMBER OF REASONS

01:11:20.042 --> 01:11:21.810
FOR THAT ONE- WORSENING

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:25.447
CONDITIONS SO- THE TWO BIGGEST

01:11:25.514 --> 01:11:26.248
ONES FOR THIS PARTICULAR

01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:29.118
PROJECT. HAS MATT HANNAH WATER

01:11:29.184 --> 01:11:32.154
ISSUE IN BOTH. BOTH IS WERE

01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:35.824
SICK. WE'RE STILL EXPECT AND I

01:11:35.891 --> 01:11:37.593
PROCESS IT'S- GOT TWELVE CENTS

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:42.064
HIGHER TO PRESSES. WE ARE ALL.

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:45.734
INCREASE CAN. THANK YOU. ALSO

ASSOCIATE TO INSTALL IN FACT IN

01:11:47.336 --> 01:11:50.039
THE ONE OF OUR LAW SECOND PROP

01:11:50.105 --> 01:11:51.340
AND RICHARD BOULEVARD WE HAD A

01:11:51.407 --> 01:11:52.908
CON DROP OUT OF THE COMPETITION

01:11:52.975 --> 01:11:55.144
OVER CONCERNS ON THE ELECTRICAL

01:11:55.210 --> 01:11:57.413
ESTIMATES- ADDITIONALLY I THINK

01:11:57.479 --> 01:12:00.182
IT'S A THE NOTE THAT FOR EVERY

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:01.550
DOLLAR THAT IT'S- IN THIS

01:12:01.617 --> 01:12:03.786
BECAUSE OF COURSE OF COST LIKE

01:12:03.852 --> 01:12:08.424
I MENTIONED IS AT ABOUT A

01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:09.058
DOLLAR FIFTEEN A DOLLAR TWENTY

01:12:09.124 --> 01:12:14.163
IT'S OF A CASCADE OF. WE HAVE A

01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:15.364
TWO. PRETTY STRONG EFFORT I

01:12:15.431 --> 01:12:17.499
THINK TO GO THROUGH AND AS

01:12:17.566 --> 01:12:19.468
THESE COST WERE BEGINNING TO BE

01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:20.869
FLAGGED AS OVER ESTIMATE FROM

01:12:20.936 --> 01:12:22.571
PREVIOUS YEARS AS WE

01:12:22.638 --> 01:12:25.074
INVESTIGATED- TO ATTEMPT TO GET

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:28.143
THEM DOWN WE LOOKED AT A NUMBER

01:12:28.210 --> 01:12:29.478
OF VALUE HEARING THIS SIZE

01:12:29.545 --> 01:12:32.981
IDEAS- ON EACH PROJECT WHAT IS

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:34.016
THE THAT'S A WE DID IT

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:36.452
SUMMARILY RICH JUST FOR THINK

01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:38.821
TRANSPARENCY. A TOP AND THING

01:12:38.887 --> 01:12:41.123
RENOVATION TGS HAS DONE THAT IN

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.458
PRIOR PROJECTS THERE ARE

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:44.526
CONSEQUENCES THOUGH TO DOING SO

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:45.828
UNLESS THE BUILDING ITSELF IS

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:47.629
ABLE TO COME IN WITHOUT

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:49.398
CONSEQUENCE IN THE FUTURE- SO

01:12:49.465 --> 01:12:50.833
YOU THE PARTITION MECHANICAL

01:12:50.899 --> 01:12:52.468
SYSTEM IN YOUR- NATION ON THAT

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:54.737
THE AMOUNT. MISSIONAL COST AND

01:12:54.803 --> 01:12:56.805
REWORK AND TENANTS- PACKS ARE

01:12:56.872 --> 01:12:59.508
SIGNIFICANT- THINK ABOUT THIS

01:12:59.575 --> 01:13:00.809
ROOM FOR EXAMPLE MOST OF THE

01:13:00.876 --> 01:13:02.144
STUFF THAT YOU WOULD TOUCH AND

01:13:02.211 --> 01:13:03.545
RENOVATION IS EITHER BEHIND THE

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:06.348
WALLS AND THE FLOOR TO CEILING

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:08.650
INTO ENGLISH. IF YOU'RE DOING A

01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:10.486
BUILDING RENOVATION THE THINGS

01:13:10.552 --> 01:13:13.856
YOU ABSOLUTE ONE HIT AND THAT'S

01:13:13.922 --> 01:13:17.526
WHERE. THE MAJORITY OF THE

01:13:17.593 --> 01:13:19.361
CALL. OUR BUT WE DID. LOOK

01:13:19.428 --> 01:13:22.297
THANK FOR A WINDOWS ON THE

01:13:22.364 --> 01:13:24.133
BUILDING THE ORIGINAL WINDOWS

01:13:24.199 --> 01:13:26.735
WERE- WOOD FRAMED IN THE

01:13:26.802 --> 01:13:28.170
SEVENTIES THERE WAS PROJECT TO

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:29.104
REPLACE THE NUMBER THE NUMBER

01:13:29.171 --> 01:13:30.072
FAILING THEY WERE ALUMINUM

01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:34.009
FRAME- WE COULD HAVE- ACOSTA

01:13:34.076 --> 01:13:35.878
DOING A REPLICA TO GO BACK

01:13:35.944 --> 01:13:38.514
THERE WOULD. WITHOUT ABOUT

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:39.782
MILLION TO THE PROJECT WE ARE

01:13:39.848 --> 01:13:41.950
WAY X. WE REJECTED THAT OPTION-

01:13:42.017 --> 01:13:44.753
THERE ARE- OTHER AREAS WHERE-

01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:48.957
WE- LOOKED AT- POTENTIAL COST

01:13:49.024 --> 01:13:51.527
ISSUES. AND REJECTED STYLE

01:13:51.593 --> 01:13:53.228
ENGINEERING EXERCISES- ONE

01:13:53.295 --> 01:13:56.098
EXAMPLE IS HVAC SO RIGHT NOW IN

01:13:56.165 --> 01:13:57.032
THE BUILDING ALL THE MECHANICAL

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:58.433
SYSTEMS ARE DECENTRALIZED FOR

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:00.269
THE FLOOR- BRINGING UP TO THE

01:14:00.335 --> 01:14:01.603
ROOF BUILDING COSTS MARGINALLY

01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:03.005
MORE ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND

01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:06.275
DOLLARS- BUT THE WHAT IT SAVES

01:14:06.341 --> 01:14:08.844
AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ENERGY

01:14:08.911 --> 01:14:10.612
EFFICIENCY NOISE ATTEND. FOR

01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:12.548
THE WAY THAT I GIVE THESE IS.

01:14:12.614 --> 01:14:13.682
SAY THAT WE THE COST ONE UP WE

01:14:13.749 --> 01:14:15.117
DID DEEP DIVE INTO THE IS IF

01:14:15.184 --> 01:14:16.585
THERE'S WAYS WE COULD CUT COSTS

01:14:16.652 --> 01:14:18.554
AND- WE FEEL OF THESE COSTS

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:19.988
ARE- APPROPRIATE FOR THE

01:14:20.055 --> 01:14:21.557
PROJECT AND THE ONCE IN A

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:22.057
LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY TO

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.358
ACTUALLY THROUGH INTO A

01:14:23.425 --> 01:14:24.860
COMPREHENSIVE RENOVATION THE

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:29.565
BUILDINGS. VERY GOOD- SHE- THE

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:31.967
DETAIL ABOUT WHY THE COSTS HAVE

01:14:32.034 --> 01:14:34.069
GONE UP SIGNIFICANTLY DO YOU DO

01:14:34.136 --> 01:14:34.803
YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION IN

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:38.340
REGARDS TO- WHAT. AND I

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:39.608
APOLOGIZE IN THE TOP OF YOUR

01:14:39.675 --> 01:14:42.177
HEAD THAT THIS STANLEY MOSK

01:14:42.244 --> 01:14:45.881
COURTS BUILDING. ON NOT THE TOP

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:48.717
OF MY HEAD SO THIS THIS THE-

01:14:48.784 --> 01:14:50.452
LABORING COURTS BUILDING ACROSS

01:14:50.519 --> 01:14:52.554
THE STREET- ON A COST PER

01:14:52.621 --> 01:14:54.423
SQUARE FOOT BASIS WAS ACTUALLY

01:14:54.489 --> 01:14:55.958
ABOUT WHAT WE ESTIMATED OUR

01:14:56.024 --> 01:14:58.093
INITIAL PROJECT FOR WE USE THAT

01:14:58.160 --> 01:14:59.228
AS AN ALONG. ONE OF THE THINGS

01:14:59.294 --> 01:15:02.331
THAT WE AND INTO THAT. AS THE

01:15:02.397 --> 01:15:04.333
COSTS COMING BACK HIGHER.

01:15:04.399 --> 01:15:05.200
OBVIOUSLY WE WANT BACK AND

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:06.969
CHECKED. PREDICT JACK ONE OF

01:15:07.035 --> 01:15:07.936
THE THINGS THAT WE DISCOVERED

01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:10.405
IS THAT RENOVATION WAS NOT.

01:15:10.472 --> 01:15:14.109
COMPLETE SO- THEY DID ABOUT 75%

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:15.244
MECHANICAL WORK IN THE BUILDING

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:17.145
80% A LIGHTING THEY DIDN'T KNOW

01:15:17.212 --> 01:15:20.015
INTERIOR BUILD OUT THAT HALF

01:15:20.082 --> 01:15:20.782
THE ELEVATORS NAY TOUCHED ABOUT

01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:23.118
TAP EIGHTEEN RESTROOMS.

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:24.753
EVENTUALLY BE A- BILL FOR THAT

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:26.255
THAT WILL DO THAT WE NEED TO

01:15:26.321 --> 01:15:27.022
ADDRESS THOSE THINGS IN THE

01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:28.657
FUTURE. THE BUILDING ALSO HAS

01:15:28.724 --> 01:15:31.360
SOME UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS. OF

01:15:31.426 --> 01:15:33.061
A SOME OF IT IS OFFICE SPACE

01:15:33.128 --> 01:15:34.263
BUT THEY DO HAVE THE

01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:35.731
SIGNIFICANT STORAGE SPACE THAT

01:15:35.797 --> 01:15:37.032
RUNS UP TO THE BUILDING THE

01:15:37.099 --> 01:15:38.066
CALL STACKS- AND IT IS A

01:15:38.133 --> 01:15:39.801
MECHANICALLY SEPARATED. YEAH

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:42.437
AND SO YOU COULD AND THEY DID-

01:15:42.504 --> 01:15:45.207
NOT TOUCHING THOSE SPACES AS

01:15:45.274 --> 01:15:46.842
THOROUGHLY AS THE OTHER ONES

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:48.010
BECAUSE YOU COULD COME IN LATER

01:15:48.076 --> 01:15:49.678
MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS. NOW THE

01:15:49.745 --> 01:15:51.546
BUILDINGS ARE YOU HAVE SIMILAR

01:15:51.613 --> 01:15:54.416
AIR. RIGHT SIX. YEAH THE COURT

01:15:54.483 --> 01:15:55.918
ROOM IT'S NOT INDIVIDUAL OFF

01:15:55.984 --> 01:15:58.287
WHICH IS IN TERMS OF THAT

01:15:58.353 --> 01:15:59.788
MECHANICAL AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

01:15:59.855 --> 01:16:02.257
YOU'VE GOT TO PROVIDE SERVICES

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:04.860
TO THEM SO I GET IT OKAY. LA

01:16:04.927 --> 01:16:06.261
THE DEPARTMENT SO MIGHT THAT

01:16:06.328 --> 01:16:06.862
YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT WHICH IS

01:16:06.929 --> 01:16:10.465
GREAT- WHICH IS FANTASTIC.

01:16:10.532 --> 01:16:12.234
COMMENDATIONS FOR THAT ALL

01:16:12.301 --> 01:16:13.435
THREE RENOVATION PROJECTS I'LL

01:16:13.502 --> 01:16:14.603
JUST GO OVER THEM ONCE IN THE

01:16:14.670 --> 01:16:15.837
INTEREST OF TIME RATHER THAN

01:16:15.904 --> 01:16:17.306
REPEATING MYSELF. I'M BASICALLY

01:16:17.372 --> 01:16:18.373
OUR RECOMMENDATION WAS TO HAVE

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:20.475
THE DEPARTMENT REPORT AT BUDGET

01:16:20.542 --> 01:16:22.911
HEARINGS- ON DIFFERENT OPTIONS

01:16:22.978 --> 01:16:24.846
LEGISLATORS HAVE AND- HE

01:16:24.913 --> 01:16:25.881
REDUCING COSTS FOR THESE

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:27.516
PROJECTS AND THE REASON FOR

01:16:27.582 --> 01:16:30.352
THAT IS THAT ONE WE NOTED THAT

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:31.920
THAT BUILDING PROJECTS WHEN

01:16:31.987 --> 01:16:35.357
THEY WERE INITIALLY PROPOSED

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:35.857
WHICH WAS. THERE IN TWO

01:16:35.924 --> 01:16:36.458
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETY. ANY

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:37.459
WE ALREADY IN OUR AND ASSIST

01:16:37.526 --> 01:16:39.428
THEM TO BE BROUGHT. STE I

01:16:39.494 --> 01:16:40.295
PROJECT THE STATE HAD

01:16:40.362 --> 01:16:42.364
UNDERTAKEN I'M AND THEN THE

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:43.498
PROJECTS AS YOU HEARD HAVE

01:16:43.565 --> 01:16:44.866
ENCOUNTERED SIGNIFICANT COST

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:46.134
INCREASES THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

01:16:46.201 --> 01:16:48.003
IS FOR HONORABLY. AND THAT'S A

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:50.372
37% COST INCREASE SO IT'S QUITE

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:52.274
SUBSTANTIAL- THE OTHER TWO

01:16:52.341 --> 01:16:54.609
BUILDINGS IT'S THAT LAST BUT%

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:57.646
STILL NOT INSIGNIFICANT 17%

01:16:57.713 --> 01:17:00.215
BATES THAN AND RE SAYS. AT A

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:01.917
FOR IN PER. COST SO THE COST

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:04.720
ARE SEEING. ENOUGH AT WE

01:17:04.786 --> 01:17:06.655
THOUGHT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:17:06.722 --> 01:17:08.423
WHEN OUT WEATHER SO COME IN IT

01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:10.125
MAY WELL BECOME. THE SCOPE

01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:13.228
THESE- RENOVATIONS I'M BACK TO

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:13.996
THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:17.899
BUDGETARY CONCERNS- WANTED ME

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:18.467
LEGISLATURE UNDERSTOOD THAT

01:17:18.533 --> 01:17:20.202
THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS CAPTION

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:24.106
SAMPLE. OR SOMEONE. AND WEBER

01:17:24.172 --> 01:17:26.408
OR TO YOU SERVE MORE SHELVE.

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:27.042
FORCE THAT HAS TRADE OFF IS THE

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:28.877
AS THE- DEPARTMENT INDICATE.

01:17:28.944 --> 01:17:29.778
BUT THAT IS A BEAUTIFUL

01:17:29.845 --> 01:17:32.080
BUILDING- AND I THINK DESPITE

01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:33.248
THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW NOT

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:34.316
EVERYTHING WAS TOUCHED IT IT.

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:35.917
REALLY IS TO DO QUITE A GOOD

01:17:35.984 --> 01:17:37.419
JOB WITH THAT BUILDING AND IT'S

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:38.854
VERY SIMILAR TO AND RIGHT AT

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.389
HIM. I THINK WAS CONSTRUCTED

01:17:40.455 --> 01:17:41.490
WITHIN ABOUT A YEAR OR TWO OF

01:17:41.556 --> 01:17:43.892
THAT BUILDING AND SO IN TERMS

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:45.560
OF LIKE. THE HISTORIC FEATURES

01:17:45.627 --> 01:17:49.464
IN THOSEKINDS OF THINGS THERE

01:17:49.531 --> 01:17:50.198
ARE SOME SIMILARITIES. SO THE-

01:17:50.265 --> 01:17:52.534
NOT. HM PROJECT AND TELL AN OF

01:17:52.601 --> 01:17:53.802
COURSE THERE'S A ITCH ACOSTA

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:54.636
INCREASES FOR THAT BUT THERE AT

01:17:54.703 --> 01:17:55.637
ALL SOME CHANCE THAT WE'LL HAVE

01:17:55.704 --> 01:17:56.605
A LITTLE BIT LESS OF A TIGHT

01:17:56.671 --> 01:17:58.907
CONSTRUCTION MARKET RIGHT NOW

01:17:58.974 --> 01:18:00.976
ALTHOUGH I THINK ECONOMIC

01:18:01.043 --> 01:18:01.943
CONDITIONS OF COURSE ARE

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:05.614
CHANGING I'M PROBABLY BY DAY M.

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:08.483
BUT- BUT- WITH THIS PROPOSAL

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:09.184
FOR TOGETHER IT ANSWERED WHEN

01:18:09.251 --> 01:18:12.421
WE ANALYZED. USED ANYWAY THAT

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:13.522
THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE LABOR VERY

01:18:13.588 --> 01:18:14.689
VERY IMPACTED IN THIS AREA THAT

01:18:14.756 --> 01:18:18.493
WAS AFFECTING SAYS WELL I'M AND

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:20.062
OF COURSE THINGS LIKE FINISHES

01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:22.330
AND OTHER KINDS OF THINGS CAN

01:18:22.397 --> 01:18:24.633
MAKE ON THE MARGINS ARE SO XIN.

01:18:24.699 --> 01:18:25.801
AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE

01:18:25.867 --> 01:18:27.069
THE LEGISLATURE. THOSE OPTION

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:27.736
AND ANSWER KNOW THAT HER IS

01:18:27.803 --> 01:18:29.171
LOOKING TO MANY OF THEM THAT.

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:31.873
ABOUT OUR OUR COMMENTS. VERY

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:35.177
GOOD. ACTIONS THIRTY NIELSEN

01:18:35.243 --> 01:18:37.212
MADAM AS TO ONE PARTICULAR

01:18:37.279 --> 01:18:41.316
POINT THAT THE FOUNTAIN- AS I

01:18:41.383 --> 01:18:42.384
CONCUR WITH THE STAFF

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:46.488
RECOMMENDATION HERE AND I'M

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:47.089
PROBABLY ONLY ONE AROUND IT'S

01:18:47.155 --> 01:18:48.290
BEEN HERE FOR. THE WHOLE

01:18:48.356 --> 01:18:50.926
DURATION OF RESTORATION THE OLD

01:18:50.992 --> 01:18:52.694
CAPITAL SIDE AND NOW THIS ONE.

01:18:52.761 --> 01:18:54.496
BUT ONE OF THE IT'S REALLY

01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:55.697
IMPORTANT AS MAINTAINING THE

01:18:55.764 --> 01:18:57.899
HISTORICAL HERITAGE. OF THE

01:18:57.966 --> 01:19:01.770
INSTITUTION. WHEN THE CAPITAL

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:04.406
HERE WAS DEEMED EARTHQUAKE

01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:07.209
VULNERABLE THERE WERE PROPOSALS

01:19:07.275 --> 01:19:09.411
TO TEAR IT ALL DOWN AND BILL

01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:11.179
TWO TWIN TOWERS THANK GOODNESS

01:19:11.246 --> 01:19:14.416

HARRIS DO OUR HISTORIC HERITAGE

01:19:17.018 --> 01:19:19.154
PREVAILED. SAME THING ABOUT THE

01:19:19.221 --> 01:19:21.990
FOUNTAIN I THINK SIMILARLY OF

01:19:22.057 --> 01:19:25.660
THE- SOLD AUTO THE- HISPANIC

01:19:25.727 --> 01:19:26.862
OFFICER THAT'S OVER THERE NOW

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:28.997
THE KIND OF RAISE THEIR OWN

01:19:29.064 --> 01:19:31.133
MONEY TO RESTORE THAT STATUTE

01:19:31.199 --> 01:19:33.368
BUT MY POINT IS THAT'S A PART

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:34.936
OF THE HERITAGE AND IT'S

01:19:35.003 --> 01:19:37.038
SOMETHING THAT DOES NEED TO BE

01:19:37.105 --> 01:19:39.241
RECOGNIZED AND CONTINUE TO BE A

01:19:39.307 --> 01:19:42.110
PART OF OUR HISTORY SO I SPEAK

01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:44.613

PARTICULAR BUILDING AS WELL I

AGREE WITH THE LA THAT. THAT

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:54.022
THE ACT COURTS BUILDING WAS

REALLY WELL DONE- YET IT AND I

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:59.127
DID HAVE A OPPORTUNITY GOING TO

01:19:59.194 --> 01:19:59.895
THE PARTS OF THE BUILDING

01:19:59.961 --> 01:20:03.899
THERE. WERE NOT DONE AND- AND I

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:05.867
UNDERSTAND WHY IT'S VERY

01:20:05.934 --> 01:20:07.169
EXPENSIVE BUT- BUT THE EN ROUTE

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:08.069
BUILDINGS A LITTLE BIT

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:09.237
DIFFERENT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE

01:20:09.304 --> 01:20:10.772
INVITED THERE ALL THE TIME AND

01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:12.541
THERE'S A LOT OF TRAFFIC IN AND

01:20:12.607 --> 01:20:13.108
OUT OF THAT BUILDING SO YOU

WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE

01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:16.478
TAKING CARE OF THE ENTIRE

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:17.979

DIRECTION FROM THE LEGISLATURE

EACH BUILDING HAS SELECT

01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:22.210
DIFFERENT DIVISIONS THIS

01:31:22.276 --> 01:31:22.777
PARTICULAR ONE IS THE WORST

01:31:22.844 --> 01:31:23.544

FOUND AS WE WERE GOING FOR THE

01:31:38.492 --> 01:31:39.393
PROJECT THEIR UNIQUE TO THIS

01:31:39.460 --> 01:31:41.729
ONE- INCLUDING- WORSENING

STRUCTURE CONDITION- THERE ARE

01:31:44.832 --> 01:31:45.299
SOME ADDITIONAL FIRE LIFE

01:31:45.366 --> 01:31:47.301
SAFETY REQUIREMENTS THAT WE

01:31:47.368 --> 01:31:48.336
FOUND FOR EXAMPLE. BY BUILDING

01:31:48.402 --> 01:31:50.137
EVERY EXISTS THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:31:50.204 --> 01:31:52.073
WHITE AND- ANSWERS GIVE SENSOR

01:31:52.139 --> 01:31:53.207
THING FOR. SOME OF THE

01:31:53.274 --> 01:31:55.376
ADDITIONAL DEFICIENT PERHAPS

CORRECT TO A TO IT- ACCOUNT FOR

01:31:57.712 --> 01:32:00.448
SPLIT THE COST INCREASE- OUR

01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:01.048
APPROACH TO DEALING WITH THAT

01:32:01.115 --> 01:32:02.283
ISSUE THE BILL. WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:03.618
DIFFERENT SIDE WERE COST ARE

01:32:03.684 --> 01:32:06.354
COSTLY APPROACH. THE ARE A

01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:07.388
NUMBER OF THINGS WE ALSO. VALUE

01:32:07.455 --> 01:32:09.857
ENGINEERING ONE- SIMPLE EXAMPLE

01:32:09.924 --> 01:32:12.460
IS THE SIDE. ON THE SIDE OF THE

01:32:12.526 --> 01:32:13.227
BUILDING IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE

01:32:13.294 --> 01:32:15.062
ADDRESSED AS PART OF THE

01:32:15.129 --> 01:32:17.164
SEISMIC. SHIFT IN THE BUILDING-

01:32:17.231 --> 01:32:19.533
WE THERE'S A NUMBER OF WAYS

01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:20.801
THAT YOU CAN DO THAT A NUMBER

01:32:20.868 --> 01:32:23.571
OF DIFFERENT- COST. APPROACHES

01:32:23.638 --> 01:32:25.373
DELIBERATELY PICKED NO THAT WAS

01:32:25.439 --> 01:32:26.874
MIDDLE THE ROAD COST- BUT

01:32:26.941 --> 01:32:29.410
EMPHASIZED LONGEVITY IN

01:32:29.477 --> 01:32:31.112
DURABILITY TO AVOID HAVING TO

01:32:31.178 --> 01:32:33.447
COME BACK AND DO WORK. FUTURE

01:32:33.514 --> 01:32:35.383
AS WELL AS- THE SAME. SEX I'M

01:32:35.449 --> 01:32:36.984
JUST AGAIN AN EXAMPLE OF CAR

01:32:37.051 --> 01:32:37.618
WHAT WE LOOKED AT TO MAKE SURE

01:32:37.685 --> 01:32:39.520
THESE COSTS ARE APPROPRIATE-

01:32:39.587 --> 01:32:41.422
AND- WE WORK NOT COSTING THE

01:32:41.489 --> 01:32:42.623
MOVE OR NOT. LOOKING THE BEST

01:32:42.690 --> 01:32:44.091
THE BEST OF THE BUILDINGS WERE

01:32:44.158 --> 01:32:45.293
WERE DOING THINGS THAT ARE

01:32:45.359 --> 01:32:46.427
FOCUSED ON LONGEVITY

01:32:46.494 --> 01:32:48.329
DURABILITY- AND BALANCING

01:32:48.396 --> 01:32:50.131
FIRST. WITH LONG TERM

01:32:50.197 --> 01:32:53.901
MAINTENANCE COSTS. NOTHING

01:32:53.968 --> 01:32:54.936
ADDITIONAL DAD YOUNG. THIS

01:32:55.002 --> 01:32:56.737
COMES IT OR WHAT WAS SAID

01:32:56.804 --> 01:32:59.307
BEFORE- AT THE QUESTIONS OF THE

01:32:59.373 --> 01:33:03.611
COMMITTEE. IS THERE ANY- MEMBER

01:33:03.678 --> 01:33:05.880
OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE

01:33:05.947 --> 01:33:06.447
TO MAKE THAT COMMENT ON THIS

01:33:06.514 --> 01:33:11.118
ISSUE. NINE I DO I DO HAVE ONE

01:33:11.185 --> 01:33:13.854
QUESTION THIS IT WAS ALWAYS A

01:33:13.921 --> 01:33:15.623
CONSIDERATION OF DEMOLITION

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:18.292
JUST THEM DEMOLISHING THIS-

01:33:18.359 --> 01:33:20.194
ANALYZED IT WAS ANALYZED- THERE

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:22.997
ARE TWO REASONS WHY. IT WAS

01:33:23.064 --> 01:33:24.932
REJECTED ONE- THE DEMOLITION

01:33:24.999 --> 01:33:27.969
COST- AND- ADDED SIGNIFICANT

01:33:28.035 --> 01:33:29.003
AMOUNT OF MONEY IN TERMS OF IF

01:33:29.070 --> 01:33:29.704
YOU WERE BE BUILDING THESE

01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:31.005
ACTIONS WERE BUT IT SHOWS THINK

01:33:31.072 --> 01:33:32.907
OF A MORE EXPENSIVE TO DO THAT-

01:33:32.974 --> 01:33:34.008
THE OTHER ISSUE IS AT THE

01:33:34.075 --> 01:33:35.643
BUILDING PREDATES THE CAPITAL

01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:37.645
PROTECTION ACT AND SO- IT WOULD

01:33:37.712 --> 01:33:39.113
ACTUALLY. NOT BE ABLE TO BE

01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:41.315
REBUILT AS LARGE AS IT

01:33:41.382 --> 01:33:42.183
CURRENTLY IS. IF YOU GET LESS

01:33:42.249 --> 01:33:45.453
BUILDING FOR THE SAME. RIGHT

01:33:45.519 --> 01:33:47.922
YEAH I GUESS I GUESS MY CONCERN

01:33:47.989 --> 01:33:50.891
IS JUST RIGHT MY CONCERN IS ARE

01:33:50.958 --> 01:33:52.093
WE GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THE

01:33:52.159 --> 01:33:53.894
ISSUES THAT HAVE PLAGUED IT

01:33:53.961 --> 01:33:56.364
WOULD FALLING WINDOWS IN CLASS

01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:58.799
AND THAT KIND OF THING- THIS IS

01:33:58.866 --> 01:33:59.934
THE BUILDING CORRECT AND THAT

01:34:00.001 --> 01:34:02.303
AND THAT NO THE BUILDING WITH

01:34:02.370 --> 01:34:04.638
THE SCAFFOLDING THE WINDOWS IS

01:34:04.705 --> 01:34:08.075
A FOURTH IN ST ARMOR WE BUILT

01:34:08.142 --> 01:34:10.378

01:34:10.444 --> 01:34:14.281
THAT HELPS. WELL MAKE. I WAS

01:34:14.348 --> 01:34:15.016

01:36:00.221 --> 01:36:02.189
ONE- OVER TWENTY ONE MILLION

01:36:02.256 --> 01:36:03.424
FOR THE RONALD REAGAN BUILDING

01:36:03.491 --> 01:36:05.159
AND SEVENTEEN POINT FOUR

01:36:05.226 --> 01:36:06.393
MILLION PER ROUND AND GEORGE

01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:08.662
COMPLEX WHICH IS TWO TOWERS I

01:36:08.729 --> 01:36:09.930
JUST GET A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW

01:36:09.997 --> 01:36:11.699
IN HARRIS BUILDING WE HAVE

01:36:11.765 --> 01:36:13.868
SEVENTEEN L. CARS- THAT ARE

01:36:13.934 --> 01:36:14.935
ORIGINAL TO BUILDING

01:36:15.002 --> 01:36:17.538
CONSTRUCTION- IN NINETEEN

01:36:17.605 --> 01:36:18.439
NINETY SEVEN SO THERE TWENTY

01:36:18.506 --> 01:36:21.308
THREE YEARS- AND- CHALLENGES

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:22.409
THERE ALSO. MANUFACTURE WITH

01:36:22.476 --> 01:36:23.644
ELEVATORS WAS SOLD IN TWO

01:36:23.711 --> 01:36:24.745
THOUSAND THREE YEAR TO INSTALL

01:36:24.812 --> 01:36:25.946
THEM TO FIND REPLACEMENT PARTS

01:36:26.013 --> 01:36:28.215
IS BECOMING YOUR POSSIBLE. RON

01:36:28.282 --> 01:36:29.817
REAGAN- BUILDING WE HAVE TWENTY

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:30.918
ELEVATOR CARS THAT ARE ALL

01:36:30.985 --> 01:36:32.953
ORIGINAL TO THE BUILDING

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:34.955
CONSTRUCTION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY

01:36:35.022 --> 01:36:36.357
NINE SO THEY'RE ALL THIRTY ONE

01:36:36.423 --> 01:36:37.691
YEARS OLD. ESSENTIALLY FULL

01:36:37.758 --> 01:36:38.592
TIME. AFTER THAT TO FIX

01:36:38.659 --> 01:36:40.628
MAINTAIN THIS POINT BECAUSE THE

01:36:40.694 --> 01:36:42.096
LEVEL OF DETAIL AND KIND OF

01:36:42.163 --> 01:36:43.197
PARTS TO PUT TOGETHER TO MAKE

01:36:43.264 --> 01:36:45.766
THESE THINGS. ON A DAILY BASIS

01:36:45.833 --> 01:36:46.667
IS REQUIRING THAT. AND IN THE

01:36:46.734 --> 01:36:49.637
WRONG. BUILDING BUILDINGS

01:36:49.703 --> 01:36:51.272
EXCUSE ME IF YOU HAVE. SIXTEEN

01:36:51.338 --> 01:36:55.309
THE ONLY MODERNIZE LAST IN.

01:36:55.376 --> 01:36:55.843
NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WAS

01:36:55.910 --> 01:36:56.443
TWENTY YEARS OLD. THERE ALSO

01:36:56.510 --> 01:37:00.681
SOME. FRIEDMAN BREAKDOWNS.

01:37:00.748 --> 01:37:03.651
PEOPLE SO WE POSIT TO YOU ALL

01:37:03.717 --> 01:37:04.418
FOR THESE PROJECTS ARE URGING

01:37:04.485 --> 01:37:05.553
NOT JUST FOR THE GO OF THE

01:37:05.619 --> 01:37:07.087
PUBLIC IN STATE EMPLOYEES IN

01:37:07.154 --> 01:37:09.356
THESE BUILDINGS- BUT TO

01:37:09.423 --> 01:37:09.990
MAINTAIN. THE SAFE BUILDINGS AS

01:37:10.057 --> 01:37:14.128
WELL. VERY GOOD OKAY THREE OF

01:37:14.195 --> 01:37:15.629
THREE ACCOMMODATIONS ON THIS

01:37:15.696 --> 01:37:17.131
ITEM AT FIRST IS- AND THIS

01:37:17.198 --> 01:37:18.499
REALLY APPLIES BOTH TO THIS

01:37:18.566 --> 01:37:19.700
ITEM AND THE NEXT I MISSPOKE

01:37:19.767 --> 01:37:21.335
COMMENTS ARE VERY SIMILAR BUT

01:37:21.402 --> 01:37:23.571
AND THE FIRST IS TO THE

01:37:23.637 --> 01:37:25.839
PROPHETIC FOR ALL THE MOST

01:37:25.906 --> 01:37:29.443
JOINT CRITICAL PROJECTS AND SO

01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:31.378
ON WE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS ON

01:37:31.445 --> 01:37:33.480
OF REAGAN PROJECT AS WELL AS A

01:37:33.547 --> 01:37:35.182
FIRE ON. ABOUT COMMITTING

01:37:35.249 --> 01:37:36.483
REJECTED RIGHT THE OTHER TWO

01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:37.651
ALRP. AND THE REASON FOR THAT

01:37:37.718 --> 01:37:38.219
IS THAT THOSE MIGHT NOT BE

01:37:38.285 --> 01:37:39.853
WORTHWHILE PROJECTS ARE GOOD

01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:44.625
PROJECTS I THINK WE AND WE JUST

01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:49.129
SAYS- AND REALLY SORT OF AT THE

01:37:49.196 --> 01:37:52.233
PUMP THE DEPART. BE FINDING.

01:37:52.299 --> 01:37:54.935
PRIDE WHO. HIS PLEA RIDLEY ON

01:37:55.002 --> 01:37:56.971
THE BILL RATES DE CHARGE FOR TO

01:37:57.037 --> 01:37:58.672
ITS TENANTS ARE INTENDED TO

01:37:58.739 --> 01:38:00.608
RECOUP THE COSTS OF OPERATING

01:38:00.674 --> 01:38:02.243
AND MAINTAINING THE BUILDINGS

01:38:02.309 --> 01:38:04.411
HASN'T ALWAYS WORKED OUT OF THE

01:38:04.478 --> 01:38:07.181
COULD AND FOR EXAMPLE DURING

01:38:07.248 --> 01:38:09.350
THE RECESSION- THAT UP. THERE

01:38:09.416 --> 01:38:10.351
WERE SOME BUT- THAT THE STATE

01:38:10.417 --> 01:38:11.685
WAS FACING AND SO ACCORDINGLY

01:38:11.752 --> 01:38:13.420
THE DEPARTMENT HELD ITS RATES

01:38:13.487 --> 01:38:15.222
VERY LOW FOR AND IT'S RENTAL

01:38:15.289 --> 01:38:17.224
RATES ON THAT THAT WAS ONE

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:18.626
CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO AT A

01:38:18.692 --> 01:38:21.128
SIGNIFICANT WELCOME TO. AND I'M

01:38:21.195 --> 01:38:21.929
SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT MEETING

01:38:21.996 --> 01:38:24.598
WITH THAT OF THE LAST FEW YEARS

01:38:24.665 --> 01:38:25.566
THAT THE STATE HAS PROVIDED

01:38:25.633 --> 01:38:28.202
SOME ONE TIME AND THE

01:38:28.269 --> 01:38:30.971
DEPARTMENT. I'M OUT OF THAT. DO

01:38:31.038 --> 01:38:32.840
YOU THINK THEN ON BASIS THAT WE

01:38:32.906 --> 01:38:34.008
SHOULD. BACK TO. A SITUATION

01:38:34.074 --> 01:38:35.709
WHERE. REALLY WE'RE COLLECTING

01:38:35.776 --> 01:38:37.478
SUFFICIENT FUNDS THROUGH THE

01:38:37.544 --> 01:38:38.545
RATE STRUCTURE TO MAINTAIN

01:38:38.612 --> 01:38:40.547
BUILDING ON GOING BASIS AND THE

01:38:40.614 --> 01:38:42.549
DEPARTMENTS PLANNING FOR THESE

01:38:42.616 --> 01:38:44.818
FUTURE NEEDS. SETTING ASIDE ANY

01:38:44.885 --> 01:38:47.955
AS- AS AS A SO WE THAT I'M THAT

01:38:48.022 --> 01:38:49.123
REALLY UNLESS IT'S ABSOLUTELY

01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:52.760
URGENT- IT REALLY WE USE. THAT

01:38:52.826 --> 01:38:55.296
SORT OF RATE STRUCTURE TO

01:38:55.362 --> 01:38:56.764
DEFEND. I SECOND WE RECOMMEND.

01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:58.032
VISUAL AND TO LIMIT THE USE TO

01:38:58.098 --> 01:38:59.233
THE SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT ARE

01:38:59.300 --> 01:39:01.468
PRUDENT REASON FOR THAT IS THAT

01:39:01.535 --> 01:39:03.504
UNDER TO COST ESTIMATES THERE'S

01:39:03.570 --> 01:39:06.507
THAT ONE AND THE B. C. P. AND

01:39:06.573 --> 01:39:08.042
THAT FIFTY SIX MILLION FOR

01:39:08.108 --> 01:39:10.411
THESE LA. AT JACK'S. YEAH AND-

01:39:10.477 --> 01:39:11.245
ARE MEANT. I'M FEW YEARS AGO

01:39:11.312 --> 01:39:13.247
THAT ON THAT ON THAT WERE

01:39:13.314 --> 01:39:14.348
ESTIMATED TO BE ONLY THIRTEEN

01:39:14.415 --> 01:39:16.684
MILLION. SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:17.685
THERE VARIETY OF REASONS FOR

01:39:17.751 --> 01:39:20.054
THAT BUT- WE THINK THERE'S SOME

01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:21.388
CHANCE THAT THESE PROJECTS

01:39:21.455 --> 01:39:22.756
COULD COME IN LOWER INTO THAT

01:39:22.823 --> 01:39:24.391
IT. IF THEY DO WE THINK THAT.

01:39:24.458 --> 01:39:26.360
IT SHOULD BE BACK TO THE- AND

01:39:26.427 --> 01:39:28.128
THEN THE THIRD IS THAT WE'RE

01:39:28.195 --> 01:39:28.996
RECOMMENDING REQUIRING THE

01:39:29.063 --> 01:39:30.197
DEPARTMENT'S REPORT ON ITS LONG

01:39:30.264 --> 01:39:31.532
TERM PLANNING FOR MAINTAINING

01:39:31.598 --> 01:39:33.467
BUILDINGS THEY'VE- IDENTIFIED A

01:39:33.534 --> 01:39:35.069
VERY SUBSTANTIAL BACKLOG. OF

01:39:35.135 --> 01:39:37.304
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- AND SO

01:39:37.371 --> 01:39:39.406
AGAIN WE DON'T THINK THAT. IT'S

01:39:39.473 --> 01:39:40.774
REALLY SUSTAINABLE THING FOR

01:39:40.841 --> 01:39:41.942
THE STATE EVERY YEAR WE DONE

01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:43.844
ANYTHING SINCE MAYBE TWO DOZEN

01:39:43.911 --> 01:39:44.878
FOURTEEN FIFTY. RECALLING

01:39:44.945 --> 01:39:45.846
CORRECTLY PROVIDED THESE ONE

01:39:45.913 --> 01:39:48.248
TIME DEFERRED INSIDE. WE DON'T

01:39:48.315 --> 01:39:51.218
THINK THAT THAT'S THE STATE TO

01:39:51.285 --> 01:39:55.289
DO AN ON GOING BASIS. TO WORK

01:39:55.356 --> 01:39:55.923
TO COME UP WITH A- SOLUTION. WE

01:39:55.989 --> 01:39:57.458
THINK. YOU KNOW IN IN YOUR- TRY

01:39:57.524 --> 01:39:59.860
TO. READ AND- THE DEPARTMENT

01:39:59.927 --> 01:40:01.161
FOR THESE JACKSON MAINTAIN

01:40:01.228 --> 01:40:05.332
THEIR AS IF LEVEL. AND I'M AT

01:40:05.399 --> 01:40:06.633
RESPONSE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:40:06.700 --> 01:40:09.002
SERVICE. YEAH I'VE I THINK WILL

01:40:09.069 --> 01:40:11.438
POINT OUT- TWO MANY THINGS

01:40:11.505 --> 01:40:12.973
PERSONS THAT WE FEEL VERY

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:13.774
STRONGLY THAT ALL THESE

01:40:13.841 --> 01:40:15.542
PROJECTS TO BE COMPLETED AS

01:40:15.609 --> 01:40:17.010
SOON AS POSSIBLE- WE'VE ALREADY

01:40:17.077 --> 01:40:19.646
STARTED THE DESIGN WORK ON. IT

01:40:19.713 --> 01:40:21.315
THE FUND'S CURRENT BEAVER

01:40:21.382 --> 01:40:24.084
MAINTENANCE THAT SAID- IT'S

01:40:24.151 --> 01:40:26.286
THE- FOR THE DAY THE OPERATION

01:40:26.353 --> 01:40:26.787
THE BUILDINGS WERE NEVER

01:40:26.854 --> 01:40:29.757
INTENDED TO CAUSE MASS TO SCALE

01:40:29.823 --> 01:40:32.326
CHECK SUCH AS IS AND WE WERE TO

01:40:32.393 --> 01:40:34.828
BUILD INTO THE RATES. NOW

01:40:34.895 --> 01:40:38.165
TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. ANY ON

01:40:38.232 --> 01:40:38.966
THE DOLLAR TO COVER COST NOW WE

01:40:39.032 --> 01:40:40.167
WOULD BE SITTING ON A GREAT

01:40:40.234 --> 01:40:41.568
CASH THAT I'M NOT SURE THE

01:40:41.635 --> 01:40:42.369
LEGISLATURE WOULD APPRECIATE

01:40:42.436 --> 01:40:44.104
QUITE FRANKLY WITHOUT HAVING

01:40:44.171 --> 01:40:46.373
MUCH MORE ROBUST DISCUSSION ON

01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.075
FUNDING MECHANISMS POTS DREAMS

01:40:48.142 --> 01:40:49.743
SO. THESE PROJECTS NEST JERRY

01:40:49.810 --> 01:40:51.345
AND BECAUSE THEY'RE FAR EXCEEDS

01:40:51.412 --> 01:40:52.780
OUR TOTAL ANNUAL BUDGET FOR

01:40:52.846 --> 01:40:53.847
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FROM

01:40:53.914 --> 01:40:57.918
ENTIRE PORTFOLIO. OKAY THIS IS-

01:40:57.985 --> 01:41:00.187
AN OPEN THE ISSUE FOR PUBLIC

01:41:00.254 --> 01:41:01.722
COMMENT IS THERE ANYONE WHO

01:41:01.789 --> 01:41:02.289
WANTS TO MAKE THE COMING ON

01:41:02.356 --> 01:41:05.459
THESE. ON THIS ISSUE SEEING

01:41:05.526 --> 01:41:05.993
NONE AT QUESTIONS FROM THE

01:41:06.059 --> 01:41:09.463
COMMITTEE. THE QUESTIONS SO

01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:12.566
CURRENTLY THE ELEVATORS ARE

01:41:12.633 --> 01:41:15.803
FUNCTIONING- NOT FUNCTIONING-

01:41:15.869 --> 01:41:17.671
AND EVERY CONCERN IS YOU

01:41:17.738 --> 01:41:20.307
PROBABLY DO ABOUT NOT HAVING

01:41:20.374 --> 01:41:23.377
FUNCTIONING ELEVATORS IN THE

01:41:23.444 --> 01:41:25.612
BUILDING. EARN THEIR IN VARIOUS

01:41:25.679 --> 01:41:27.448
STATES QUITE CANDIDLY AND I DO

01:41:27.514 --> 01:41:28.615
NOT HAVE IN FRONT OF ME THE

01:41:28.682 --> 01:41:29.683
EXACT NUMBERS OF WHAT'S HOW

01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:30.818
MANY ARE FUNCTIONING TODAY WHAT

01:41:30.884 --> 01:41:31.919
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS ONE GOES

01:41:31.985 --> 01:41:34.021
UP AND ONE GOES DOWN AND ALL

01:41:34.087 --> 01:41:35.756
FOUR OF THESE BILLS. WE HAVE

01:41:35.823 --> 01:41:37.591
RARE. EARLY FOLKS. ELEVATORS OR

01:41:37.658 --> 01:41:38.659
JUST NOT ENOUGH ELEVATORS TO

01:41:38.725 --> 01:41:40.360
SERVICE THE FOLKS COMING UP AND

01:41:40.427 --> 01:41:41.862
DOWN THE BUILDING SO IT IS A

01:41:41.929 --> 01:41:43.764
HUGE. SERVICE ISSUED TO BOTH.

01:41:43.831 --> 01:41:45.365
AND CANDIDLY. BOYS ROBERT

01:41:45.432 --> 01:41:47.434
WORKING THESE BUILDINGS AND-

01:41:47.501 --> 01:41:48.569
HAS BECOME A CHALLENGE AS WELL.

01:41:48.635 --> 01:41:51.238
BECAUSE CONCERT AND- I'M SURE

01:41:51.305 --> 01:41:53.874
YOU WILL GO FOR WITH THIS- WHAT

01:41:53.941 --> 01:41:56.810
IS THE TIME. SO THEY WOULD BE

01:41:56.877 --> 01:41:59.179
AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING

01:41:59.246 --> 01:41:59.980
REMARKS ALL THREE OF THESE

01:42:00.047 --> 01:42:02.616
PROJECTS WE HAVE UNDER SIGN UP

01:42:02.683 --> 01:42:03.851
THE GOAL WOULD BE IF APPROVED

01:42:03.917 --> 01:42:06.887
BY BOTH LEGISLATION ON THE

01:42:06.954 --> 01:42:08.489
AMOUNT THAT WE WOULD START

01:42:08.555 --> 01:42:09.923
CONSTRUCTION ON ALL THREE OF

01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.958
THESE PROJECTS IN THE NEXT

01:42:11.024 --> 01:42:13.093
FISCAL YEAR. WE WOULD BE IN

01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:13.927
CONSTRUCTION. THIS FISCAL IN

01:42:13.994 --> 01:42:15.162
WHICH THE DOLLARS WERE

01:42:15.229 --> 01:42:16.964
APPROPRIATE. SO MEANWHILE

01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:19.266
THEY'RE STILL MEANWHILE THE

01:42:19.333 --> 01:42:21.768
WORST WE'RE STILL WORKING THEIR

01:42:21.835 --> 01:42:24.838
DATA SERVICING THEM CORRECTLY.

01:42:24.905 --> 01:42:26.540
SO THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO

01:42:26.607 --> 01:42:27.774
HOLD OPEN THE SYSTEM

01:42:27.841 --> 01:42:30.177
RECOMMENDATIONS OR WILL DO THAT

01:42:30.244 --> 01:42:31.345
AND THAT TAKE A LOOK AT THIS

01:42:31.411 --> 01:42:34.648
AGAIN- ISSUE NUMBER SIXTEEN IT

01:42:34.715 --> 01:42:37.751
THE SAUDIS MANAGEMENT DIVISION

01:42:37.818 --> 01:42:40.387
FIRE ASSIST. ME IN ADDITION TO

01:42:40.454 --> 01:42:41.955
THE ELEVATOR MADE ITS BCP WE

01:42:42.022 --> 01:42:43.624
HAVE A SECOND PC PEACE DAY FOR

01:42:43.690 --> 01:42:44.725
YOU THE REQUEST TWENTY THREE

01:42:44.791 --> 01:42:46.193

THAT WE FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT-

02:08:31.170 --> 02:08:33.072
BEING SUCCESSFUL. IT CAN BE THE

02:08:33.138 --> 02:08:35.507
INTERSECTION OF MUCH OF OUR

CREATES OMMUNITY RESILIENCY. I

02:08:54.927 --> 02:08:56.328
AM GOING TO EXPLAIN WHERE THE

02:08:56.395 --> 02:08:57.796
ONE MILLION WOULD GO UP TO TEN

02:08:57.863 --> 02:08:59.431
POINT FIVE THE ONE MILLION IS

02:08:59.498 --> 02:09:00.566
TO DEVELOP DISASTER

02:09:00.632 --> 02:09:01.567
PREPAREDNESS AND THIS IS

02:09:01.633 --> 02:09:03.202
SOMETHING THAT ARTS COUNCIL'S

REAP IF WE PUT TOGETHER. AND

02:09:20.886 --> 02:09:24.056
ENGAGE NINETEEN. AND SO THE

02:09:24.123 --> 02:09:25.057
GOAL OF THIS ONE MILLION IS TWO

02:09:25.124 --> 02:09:27.793
X. ON THAT WORK SO IT'S TO

02:09:27.860 --> 02:09:29.261

THE BUDGET LANGUAGE BUT WE LIKE

02:09:43.876 --> 02:09:44.943
TO ADD THE IDEA THAT ALSO.

02:09:45.010 --> 02:09:46.311
PROTECT HAVE WORK DO YOU SPACE

THAT COULD BE IMPACTED BY ANY

02:09:55.888 --> 02:09:58.524
KIND OF DESIGN. AND BECAUSE AS

02:09:58.590 --> 02:10:00.459
WE KNOW IT IT'S NOT JUST

02:10:00.526 --> 02:10:04.363
ARTIFACTS- SO THIS AS I SAID

02:10:04.429 --> 02:10:06.031
WE'RE GOING TO BUILD ON THIS

02:10:06.098 --> 02:10:07.199
WILL BUILD UP I SEE A SEIZE

02:10:07.266 --> 02:10:08.333

PARTNERS THAT I MENTIONED- AND

02:10:18.043 --> 02:10:19.211
IT SUPPORTED THEIR COMPACT UNIT

02:10:19.278 --> 02:10:20.879
ABILITY OF THESE ARTS AND

NINETEEN OF THEM AND SO OF

02:10:56.515 --> 02:10:57.349

BEEN IMPLEMENTED FOR THE PAST

02:12:05.751 --> 02:12:06.852
THREE YEARS FOR THE CALIFORNIA

THE CAPITAL CALL FOR IT WITH.

02:12:09.354 --> 02:12:10.989
THE STATE DEPARTMENT'S AROUND

ISSUES- WE'RE COMMITTED TO

02:12:13.258 --> 02:12:14.760
DEVELOPING AN ORGANIZATIONAL

OUR COMMUNITIES. SO THIS

02:12:23.902 --> 02:12:25.804
FRAMEWORK THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED

02:12:25.871 --> 02:12:27.472
INCLUDES MANY TOOLS THAT WILL

HELP US WALK THROUGH THE

02:12:29.708 --> 02:12:30.909
DESIGN. PROCESS HOW WE'RE GOING

02:12:30.976 --> 02:12:34.212
TO. ALLOW THIS SIX DAY. SIXTH

02:12:34.279 --> 02:12:37.716
GRAND. WE THAT AS A TOOL WE USE

02:12:37.783 --> 02:12:39.017
THE DAY THAT WE LEARNED FROM

02:12:39.084 --> 02:12:40.619
MARVIN. OF TO A COMPREHENSIVE

02:12:40.686 --> 02:12:42.721
APPROACH AND ENSURE. THAT THE

02:12:42.788 --> 02:12:44.656
BULLY ROLLED OUT OF TOTAL TO

02:12:44.723 --> 02:12:46.425
SIX PROGRAM I'M REPRESENTS THE

02:12:46.491 --> 02:12:48.160
STATE BOTH GRAPHICALLY AND

02:12:48.226 --> 02:12:51.596
RACIALLY- AND THAT WE RETAIN

02:12:51.663 --> 02:12:52.397
HOME GROWN ART AND CULTURAL

02:12:52.464 --> 02:12:54.866
ASSETS. THOSE COMMUNITIES AND

02:12:54.933 --> 02:12:56.568
THAT WE MEDICAID DISPLACEMENT

02:12:56.635 --> 02:12:57.602
FOR GROUPS SUCH AS ARTISTS. LOW

02:12:57.669 --> 02:13:00.339
INCOME RESIDENTS AND ARTS

02:13:00.405 --> 02:13:06.578
ORGANIZATIONS. GOOD HELLO HI SO

02:13:06.645 --> 02:13:08.146
WE KNOW THAT IN GENERAL WE

02:13:08.213 --> 02:13:09.881
THINK THEY'RE PRICED APPEARS

02:13:09.948 --> 02:13:10.882
REASONABLE IF IT'S CONSISTENT

02:13:10.949 --> 02:13:12.484
WITH LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES-

02:13:12.551 --> 02:13:15.354
BUT WE WOULD NOTE THAT-WHEN IT

02:13:15.420 --> 02:13:16.421
WE THINK ONE OF THE GREAT

02:13:16.488 --> 02:13:17.989
VALUES OF POTENTIALLY EXPANDING

02:13:18.056 --> 02:13:22.461
THIS BOTH PROGRAMS OF THE MAIN

02:13:22.527 --> 02:13:23.161
PROGRAMS AT THE OPPOSING FINE

02:13:23.228 --> 02:13:24.396
THEY'VE MALL SCALE THE LAST

02:13:24.463 --> 02:13:28.066
COUPLE YEARS. TO GIVE THE A

02:13:28.133 --> 02:13:29.634
MORE YEARS THE HOW THEY-

02:13:29.701 --> 02:13:30.669
OPERATE AB. THE STATE MAKES A-

02:13:30.736 --> 02:13:32.070
OF WHETHER. TO INVEST IN THESE

02:13:32.137 --> 02:13:34.106
AS ACTIVITIES ON A LONG TERM

02:13:34.172 --> 02:13:36.041
MAYBE ONGOING BASIS I'M

02:13:36.108 --> 02:13:37.142
SWEEPING THAT'S A REASONABLE

02:13:37.209 --> 02:13:38.810
APPROACH BUT WE THINK IN ORDER

02:13:38.877 --> 02:13:39.378
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATE

02:13:39.444 --> 02:13:42.047
HAS. INFORMATION AT THE END OF

02:13:42.114 --> 02:13:44.015
THE YEAR TWO OR THREE YEARS-

02:13:44.082 --> 02:13:46.084
PERIOD WHERE THIS THESE NEW

02:13:46.151 --> 02:13:49.221
PILOTS ARE. ARE OCCURRING. IN

02:13:49.287 --> 02:13:52.090
TO HAVE. GOALS FOR THEM AS WELL

02:13:52.157 --> 02:13:53.692
AS MEASURABLE OUTCOMES. PART OF

02:13:53.759 --> 02:13:56.194
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE TO OLD ONE

02:13:56.261 --> 02:13:57.896
AND I'M- WE THAT THE

02:13:57.963 --> 02:14:02.768
LEGISLATURE. ESTABLISH SPECIFIC

02:14:02.834 --> 02:14:06.271
GOALS FOR THE PROGRAM COULD

02:14:06.338 --> 02:14:14.946
CIVIC. BUT NOT GOAL. ONE OF THE

02:14:15.013 --> 02:14:16.148
KEY GOAL FOR THESE HAVE. AND IF

02:14:16.214 --> 02:14:19.351
IT'S MEANT. I'M OF THE INITIAL

02:14:19.418 --> 02:14:19.918
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE

THEIR OWN WILLING TO SUPPLY

02:21:46.331 --> 02:21:47.765
ANSWERS TO SAY THAT THERE'S A

02:21:47.832 --> 02:21:49.133
THERE'S A LOT. THERE'S A LOT OF

02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:51.569
BACKGROUND TO THIS AND BECAUSE

02:21:51.636 --> 02:21:52.971
IT EVERYTHING THAT HAS BEEN

02:21:53.037 --> 02:21:54.973
RAISED HERE IS A CONCERN OF OUR

WE'RE VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT

02:22:28.973 --> 02:22:31.342
OPTION TO LOOK FOR OUTCOMES AND

02:22:31.409 --> 02:22:33.444
DEFINE THOSE BEFORE WE ROLL OUT

DISTRICTS AND WE CAN DO THAT

02:22:38.716 --> 02:22:41.452

02:23:11.616 --> 02:23:13.718
SUPPORT TOOL THAT WILL TAKE US

02:23:13.785 --> 02:23:15.353

PART OF THE- A MODEL OF THE

02:23:39.177 --> 02:23:40.645
COUPLE DISTRICTS IS THAT IT

02:23:40.712 --> 02:23:41.746

02:23:46.084 --> 02:23:47.218
BE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE

02:23:47.285 --> 02:23:48.319
COURT OF JUSTICE AS WE DEVELOP

THAT FRAMEWORK AND HOW THAT

02:25:36.794 --> 02:25:39.697
THAT BREAKS OUT- AND HOW THAT

02:25:39.764 --> 02:25:42.066
REALLY DOES LOOK AT HOW WE OUT

02:25:42.133 --> 02:25:42.800
REACHED UNDERSERVED

02:25:42.867 --> 02:25:44.735
COMMUNITIES- IN ADDITION I

THAT WE ARE RIGHT ALREADY DO

02:25:48.906 --> 02:25:51.109
FUND- OUTSIDE. STICKS THAT

02:25:51.175 --> 02:25:52.977
SPACE WE TARGET DIFFERENT

02:25:53.044 --> 02:25:54.112
COMMUNITIES THAT YOU MENTIONED

02:25:54.178 --> 02:25:56.147
TODAY AND ALSO JUST MORE

02:25:56.214 --> 02:25:57.381
SPECIFICALLY GETTING TO YOUR

02:25:57.448 --> 02:25:59.617
QUESTION ABOUT HOW WE WILL

02:25:59.684 --> 02:26:00.184
REACH OUT AS AN HONEST SAID

02:26:00.251 --> 02:26:01.419
WITH CULTURE DISTRICTS WE

02:26:01.486 --> 02:26:03.387
HAVEN'T YET DEVELOPED. AND

02:26:03.454 --> 02:26:04.555
LINES AND SO WE WILL DEFINITELY

02:26:04.622 --> 02:26:07.091
BE CHANGING HOW WE OUT REACH

02:26:07.158 --> 02:26:10.628
BASED ON THE RESULTS WE HAVE

02:26:10.695 --> 02:26:13.197
FROM EVALUATION ALL WE PLAN I'M-

02:26:13.264 --> 02:26:16.134
TOGETHER. A GROUP OF A-

02:26:16.200 --> 02:26:18.369

BE CULTURAL DISTRICTS AND- ONE

02:26:33.384 --> 02:26:34.252
THING INTERESTING ABOUT THERE

02:26:34.318 --> 02:26:35.887
WERE SEVEN CRITERIA THAT WERE

02:26:35.953 --> 02:26:38.856

WOULD BE FOR THAT AB CULTURAL

02:26:51.302 --> 02:26:55.273
DISTRICTS ADAM AUNT AND- THE

02:26:55.339 --> 02:26:56.140
PROBLEM WAS THEY JUST MIGHT

02:26:56.207 --> 02:27:02.813
WORK. THEY TELL SHIPS. HELLO

02:27:02.880 --> 02:27:04.148
DISTRICTS RIGHT AND DEFINE

02:27:04.215 --> 02:27:06.484
DEVELOP. REALLY FEEL THAT THOSE

02:27:06.551 --> 02:27:08.186
NASCENT ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE

02:27:08.252 --> 02:27:10.154
LIFTED BY THAT AND THAT WE WILL

02:27:10.221 --> 02:27:11.422
OPEN THE DOOR IN THIS THESE

02:27:11.489 --> 02:27:12.657
FUNDS WILL CERTAINLY OPEN THE

02:27:12.723 --> 02:27:14.125
DOOR FOR MANY MORE

02:27:14.192 --> 02:27:17.161
POSSIBILITIES. JUST TO CLARIFY

02:27:17.228 --> 02:27:18.596
TO WHAT CRISTINA THANK THE

02:27:18.663 --> 02:27:20.898
DEVELOPMENT SO WE'RE LOOKING AT

02:27:20.965 --> 02:27:22.633
A TIERED FUNDING OPPORTUNITY

02:27:22.700 --> 02:27:23.401
FOR ALSO DISTRICTS GOING

02:27:23.467 --> 02:27:25.169
FORWARD THERE WILL BE A FULL ON

02:27:25.236 --> 02:27:26.671
COACH DISTRICT THAT AS THOSE

02:27:26.737 --> 02:27:28.239
PARTNERSHIP THIS KRISTIN.

02:27:28.306 --> 02:27:30.608
MENTIONED TO TRY FACT THAT THE

02:27:30.675 --> 02:27:31.709
BUSINESS THE ART ORGANIZATION

02:27:31.776 --> 02:27:33.444
AND THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND

02:27:33.511 --> 02:27:34.946
THEY WOULD ORGAN IS THAT ARE

02:27:35.012 --> 02:27:37.181
DEVELOPING THAT THOSE

02:27:37.248 --> 02:27:39.483
PARTNERSHIPS AND THEY COULD-

02:27:39.550 --> 02:27:42.186
UP. FOR NAY BUT THE MONEY THAT

02:27:42.253 --> 02:27:43.921
GIVE THEM GAP TO APPLY THE NEXT

02:27:43.988 --> 02:27:44.922
YEAR FOR MORE AND- SO WE WERE

02:27:44.989 --> 02:27:46.490
TRY TO LOOK AT I THINK THAT'S A

02:27:46.557 --> 02:27:47.758
VERY. SIMPLE WAY TO LOOK AT

02:27:47.825 --> 02:27:49.093
FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES I THINK

02:27:49.160 --> 02:27:51.829
THE COUNSELORS. AS REALLY

02:27:51.896 --> 02:27:52.697
WEIGHED IN ON THAT AND THEY

02:27:52.763 --> 02:27:53.431
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

02:27:53.497 --> 02:27:55.666
NOT MISSING. THOSE ORGAN SENSE

02:27:55.733 --> 02:27:57.301
THAT ARE. ALSO READY AND THEY

02:27:57.368 --> 02:27:58.035
JUST NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE

02:27:58.102 --> 02:28:00.004
SUPPORT. AND WE'RE VERY

02:28:00.071 --> 02:28:02.473
COMMITTED TO. THESE DISTRICTS

02:28:02.540 --> 02:28:04.041
HAVING A BURST PIPE BUT FUNDING

02:28:04.108 --> 02:28:06.777
PORTFOLIO BECAUSE OF THAT COOL

02:28:06.844 --> 02:28:08.646
SUSTAINABILITY RIGHT IT TOTALLY

02:28:08.713 --> 02:28:11.249
DOES. A REGIONALLY SUPPORTED.

02:28:11.315 --> 02:28:16.554
AND WHERE WHERE EVER THAT IF

02:28:16.621 --> 02:28:17.755
THEY HAVE FUN START TO. SLOW

02:28:17.822 --> 02:28:21.325
DOWN. VACANCY BE VIABLE YEAH WE

02:28:21.392 --> 02:28:22.893
ALSO APPRECIATE PETER KAMINSKY

02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:24.729
COMING BECAUSE HE REPRESENTS IS

02:28:24.795 --> 02:28:26.430
COALITION OF THEM AND SO IN

02:28:26.497 --> 02:28:27.765
DEVELOPING THESE NEW DISTRICTS

02:28:27.832 --> 02:28:29.734
WE DEFINITELY BELIEVE THAT

02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:31.569
THESE FOURTEEN DISTRICTS WILL

02:28:31.636 --> 02:28:34.272
SERVE AS ROLE MODELS OR MENTORS

02:28:34.338 --> 02:28:35.406
FOR. AND I THINK THAT WILL

02:28:35.473 --> 02:28:37.241
REALLY HELP THEY'RE SUCH A

02:28:37.308 --> 02:28:40.311
CLOSE GROUP AND THEY'RE WORKING

02:28:40.378 --> 02:28:42.046
TOGETHER TO ATTACK EACH OTHER.

02:28:42.113 --> 02:28:44.682
OKAY THAT WILL HELP. IN ORDER

02:28:44.749 --> 02:28:45.850
BRUCE COME TOGETHER FOR

02:28:45.916 --> 02:28:48.219
PARTNERSHIP HAVE IDEAS HOW.

02:28:48.286 --> 02:28:50.488
MUCH THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD

02:28:50.554 --> 02:28:51.522
BE REALLY HELPFUL BECAUSE OF A
