MEASURE HOW THAT AFFECTS STUDENTS FOUND WAS EXERCISE THAT THEY THEY THEMSELVES ARE USED IN MY PROFESSORS DOUBLE STUDENT EMMA CAPABILITY. AND NOT ONLY THAT BUT IMPROVES OVERALL. YOU KNOW WELL THAT IT SO I FIGURED THAT SINCE WE HAVE THIS THING THAT. TO WORK. AND COMMUNITIES WITH THE RESOURCES THAT ALLOW SEE. HOW IT WORKS CAN USE THAT THE WAR. YOU CHECK THE FABRIC OF THIS NATION IN TERMS OF VIOLENCE. GET OUT EVERYBODY MY NAME MY LIVELY SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AGAIN FOR THE CENTER TO PREVENT. RIGHT ACTOR UNITY VIOLENCE INITIATIVE SO I WANTED TO JUST A LITTLE BIT OF SORT OF CONTACTS SETTING AND TAKE A LOOK AT THIS FROM A SORT OF. A NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S A SURPRISE TO ANYONE THAT GUN VIOLENCE OUT OF CONTROL IN THE STATE YOU CAN OTHER HIGH INCOME COUNTRIES WORLD. ANYTHING PEOPLE ARE PARTICULARLY IMPACTED BY THIS DEMI. THESE ARE THE THIRD CAUSE OF DEATH FOR GUN PEOPLE FOR GOOD FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES. WHICH I THINK IS PRETTY STAGGERING AND AT THIS POINT ALMOST A 100% OF OUR KIDS IN PUBLIC SCHOOL ARE DISSIPATE. IN ACT SHOOTER DRILLS WITH TO BE EXTREMELY A LOT. IT ALSO LOCKS. ROUGHLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF EIGHT SINCE YOUR TWO THOUSAND AND THIS WHICH IS JUST A STAGGERING NUMBER LIVES CUT SHORT. WE KNOW FROM RESEARCH ANALYTICS. THE GUN. IN EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE LINKED TO DRAMA TO PTSD AND TO. TERM AND LONG TERM PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS. SO WHAT HELPS EXPLAIN THIS DEVASTATING EPIDEMIC WIDE KNIGHTED STATES DIFFERENT FROM OTHER DEVELOPED HIGH INCOME NATIONS IN THE WORLD. THE ANSWER IS THE ACCESS TO FIREARMS THAT JUST TODAY ARE VERY RECENTLY THE A TF RELEASED. NEW ESTIMATES SHOWING THAT THERE ARE MORE THAN FOUR. MILLION. ARMS AND SIT IN HERE TO THE UNITED STATES THAT'S MORE THAN ONE. FOR EVERY MAN WOMAN OUT IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WE COMBINED THAT IN THIS COUNTRY WITH EXTREMELY WEAK GUN LAWS GUN REGULATION OF THE FEDERAL LEVEL AT THE STATE LEVEL ONE OF THE THINGS THE GIFFORDS IS WE GRADY TO THE STATES BASED ON THE STRENGTH OR WEAKNESS OF. POLICY IS IT TRUE THAT THAT THE MAJORITY. OF NF THREE DOING VERY LATE FALL TO ADDRESS THAT PARTICULAR PROBLEM. CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY HAS THE NATION'S GUN LAWS. IN RECENT DECADES THAT HAS HELPED US TO LARGE. USE OUR GOT IT THEN WE CURRENTLY HAVE ONE OF THE LOWEST GUN SUICIDE RATE IN THE NATION AND OUR GUN HOMICIDE RATE HAS BEEN REDUCED DRAMATICALLY AS WELL. WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF WORK LEFT. CALIFORNIA AND I HIGHLIGHT INTERPERSONAL MY COMMENTS BECAUSE THAT PARTICULARLY IMPACTS ON PEOPLE THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR AND ALTHOUGH MASS SHOOTINGS DENOMINATOR NATIONAL CONVERSATION AND POP THE HEADLINES IN OUR COUNTRY IT IS DAILY GOTTEN VIOLENT. HEARING FOR INDIA AND AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT. THREE OF SH. AND THIS ONE JUST IS COMMUNITY BLUR AND IS OFTEN COMMITTED BY PEOPLE CELEBS HAVE BEEN THE VICTIM. FOUR TIMES IN THEIR LIFE. PEOPLE HURT PEOPLE OUR POLICY THINK HOW. LIKE THAT THE GOOD NEWS IS. HELP SHOW ME KLAY REDUCED RATES ISLANDS IN OUR CITIES AND A RELIC. TIME. EXAMPLES COME FROM HERE GLENN AND ALSO IN THE AREA. WHERE PROGRAMS LIKE ADVANCE PEACE ARE WORKING IN IT AND WHERE THOSE AT HIGHEST RISK GIVEN. AFTER PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELLING AND CAUGHT INTO BEHAVIORAL THERAPY. IS YOUR HIGH INVOLVEMENT WITH VIOLENCE THIS YEAR DIFFERENCE IN A WHOLE ORGANIZATION. LEADERSHIP SEMI AWAKE TO PUSH FOR CALIFORNIA TOO DRAMATIC INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT IN THE CALIFORNIA VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PREVENTION PROGRAM ALSO NOW. WHICH IS WHERE ONE OF THE FEW STATES IN THE COUNTRY THE PROVIDING RESOURCES FOR CITY THE SCALE TYPE OF INTERVENTION PROGRAMS THAT ARE HAVING SUCH HUGE IMPACT. SO WE CAN. MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE COMING YEAR. TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE. YOU TO HAVE THAT WAS WHEN YOU APPROPRIATION WE STEP DIRECTIONS TO CONTINUE THAT WORK SO I JUST WRAP UP I THINK WOULD BE BACK WITH THE LEAD JUST AGAIN AND THE GOVERNOR AGAIN HERE TO INSIST THAT THE SPENDING CONTINUE AT THAT AND INCREASE OVER TIME AND THAT WE ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THING. USING AN ENDING HOMICIDE GUN HOMICIDE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE YOU PUTTING OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS IN INVESTING THOSE RESOURCES WILL THAT MAKE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE SO AND THERE THANK. I'M ON THE PILL AND BOUGHT A NEW. POINT AFTER AND THEN FOR THE CAMPAIGN. HAPPILY THE FROM OTHERS IN CHARGE ON. PUBLISHED. HELLO CHALLENGING THIS IS. BECAUSE IT AFFECTED ME IN SOME WAYS FIRST OF I LOST MY YOUNGEST SON TO GO I'M AS IN NINETY SIX WALLET TO INTEGRATE TO PARTY. AND TWO PEOPLE. THE NEW FRIENDS OF HIS. CAME TO THE PARTY ONE HAD THE OTHER ONES JORI ALL ROUNDER WANTED IT AND THE OTHER ONE WHO. AS YOU WANT TO GIVE IT TIME SOUL THE MODIFIER TO RESOLVE. AND AWAY FROM THE BECAUSE THEY KNEW THAT YOUNG MAN CARRY ON SO HE THEY WONDERED WHY IT'S HARD TO GET HURT AT THAT TIME. YOU KNOW IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY LATINO COMMUTE IS GONE EVERYWHERE BECAUSE IT WAS THE CRACK COCAINE EPIDEMIC AND THE DRUG. THE WALL WELL- IN OUR IN OUR NATION SO. THE YOUNG MAN THAT MY SON DID HAVE SOME- MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IT WAS. HE DIDN'T KNOW WE HAD. HELLO SOREN NEVER UNTIL HE BECAME INCARCERATED NOT. AN ELSE BIPOLAR HOWEVER AND HE SOME TALK TIME AND HE MIGHT. I'M SO. IT GIVES HIM AND MYSELF BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF TRYING TO BE THE PEACEMAKER THE MAN. IT ESCALATED AND YOU KNOW WHAT EACH OTHER ON THE MAN PULLED HIS PULLED A GUN SHOP TIMES MY SON DIED A MAINLY ON SCENE. MYSELF FOR YOURSELF. I HAVE BEEN JULY TWENTY TWO NINETY SIX.

ONE. I'M IN IT TO WIN IT AND NOT STOP WE WERE YELLING AND SCREAMING OF THIS OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO HE'S BEEN GONE- BEFORE THE SCHOOLS TO DO FOR ALL THOSE. THINGS THAT HAD HAPPENED AND I'LL GO ON COUNTRY- THEM. IF YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM NOW IS GOING TO SPREAD IT'S GOING TO BECOME AN EPIDEMIC. DO YOU THINK NOR SO THEY IGNORE LOOK WHERE WE ARE TODAY SO I'M HERE BECAUSE OF THAT. AND TO SEE A STOP KILLING THE HIP. HEY MY NAME IS ERIC RICE I AM ALSO SENDING BRADY IN NATIONAL ACCOUNTS PREVENTION ORGANIZATION I'M AT THE OPEN PART. OF OUR THANK. IF I FOCUS ON HELLO. TO OUR COMMUNITY BECAUSE- EQUALLY YEAH. LIKELY TO BE SHOT THAN THEIR PEERS IN OTHER DEVELOPED NATIONS. IN TWENTY THIRTEEN CALIFORNIA THE SEVENTEENTH HIGHEST HOMICIDE RATE FOR AGES TEN TO TWENTY FOUR ON AVERAGE. INTERPRETING FOURNET. EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SEVEN TO TWENTY. IT IS LIKELY. EVEN IN A DATE WITH SOME OF THE STRONGEST GUN LAWS IN THE COUNTRY GUN VIOLENCE REMAINS AN EPIDEMIC SPECIALLY FOR YOUTH OF COLOR. NO PART WAS A MAJOR TURNING POINT IN THE GUT WRENCHING. HOWEVER IN THE AIR AFTER PARKLAND ALAMEDA COUNTY HAVE THE SECOND HIGHEST RATE DO YOU THINK THIS. TO TAKE A MOMENT. JOHNSON WHO HAS GRACIOUSLY ALLOWED ME TO SHARE HIS STORY TODAY. AT FOUR OH HOUSE WAS OAKLAND ON A SUNDAY MORNING PUMP MISLEAD OR. HE WORE SOMEWHAT WHEN THE SHOOTER GAME BUT THE SCARS OF THAT DATE FROM SEARS. REMEMBER LYING ON THE GROUND. AS HE WAITED FOR OPD. HEALING CIRCLES. FOR HIS CONTINUED RECOVERY HAS HIS NAME HE SHARES SPOKE OF. HE AND HIS WIFE KEEP BEING IN THE LIFE WOULD NEVER BE AS HE AND A SPOT. AT THE TIME IN BED. AS A REMINDER. US YOUTH EVEN WE HAVE THIS INSTANT. I CITIES CONTINUE TO REDUCE CHEATING SIMILAR TO THE ONE CASE. THE RATE OF TEEN SUICIDE IS PAYING SUICIDE IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR TEN TO. THERE'S SOME RELATIONS ARE MORE VULNERABLE THAN OTHER OF FOR EXAMPLE THE LGBTQ YOUTH. ARE UP TO FOUR TIMES. RISING RATE OF SUICIDE IN. SAM REGARD THE REASON. MICHAEL SIEGEL OF DIVERSITY IS KIND OF ONE THING HOW HOUSEHOLD GUN. WAS THE SINGLE GUESS PROTECTOR OF YOUTH SUICIDE RATE IN ANY STATE. IT'S A COMPANY IS A PUBLIC HEALTH. BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO REDUCE HARM. ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH THIS FRIENDLY SPACE. AND TO ABILITY OF GUNS BECAUSE A PROGRESSION TO MORE. ACCESS. AND AVAILABILITY AND HOMES AND COMMUNITIES FOR YOU. AND EVERYONE HI MY NAME IS CRYSTAL LOPILATO AND I'M A WITH. IN MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE I'M BERNARD A BUSY PLAYING A LOT FOR HIM BUT A START DURING MY TIME WITH MOM AND ACTION A FEW YEARS AGO. BECAUSE I COULDNT SIDELINES AND MORE AS OUR GUN VIOLENCE EPIDEMIC. A LOT OF ROLE. MIGHT TURN THREE WHICH MEANS I SPEND EVERY NIGHT CHECK FOR HER BACK BUT IN IN THE CAR I SAID. THOSE BEARS AND IF YOU GO RIGHT AFTER THE SHOOTING AT A HIGH ON ST RITA DAUGHTER STARTED ASKING ME TO CHECK FOR BAD GUYS TO. THE NEXT NIGHT ASKED ME IF THE PIGGY AMHERST. SCARED BECAUSE MAYBE THERE WAS A BAD GUY WHO WAS IT HIM. NEVER SAY THAT BUT THOSE ARE THE WORDS SHE SAID AND- OF COURSE THE BEDTIME STORY HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH GOD THE BAD GUYS WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THOSE TOPICS WITH HER YET. WE ARE. THREE AND SHE GOES TO BOTH AND NOW VERY REAL FEARS ABOUT HAD GUYS GUNS. BEING MADE NOR THAT MANY COMMUNITIES HAVE TO FOR THEIR SAFETY JUST TALKING TO AND FROM SCHOOL. THE WEATHER IN THIS PANEL AND BECAUSE WE CANNOT NUMBER. THEY HAVE THOSE WORRIES. SO HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW OF THE GUN IS IMPACTING OUR- HEALTH. FIRST WE KNOW THE KIDS ARE DYING. IMPOSSIBLE TO IT. AT AIR COMMENCED FOREMEN AVERAGE OF TWO OF THE SIX CHILDREN AND TEENS AGES YOUR- DIVE. PERCENT OF THESE DEATHS ARE HOME. FIREARMS ARE THE SECOND LEADING TO DEATH CHILDREN AND TEENS IN CALIFORNIA. AND BLACK CHILDREN AND TEENS IN CALIFORNIA SO. HE IS A WHITE PEERS TO DIE BY GUN. WE KNOW THAT THE IMPACT OF VIOLENCE IS BEYOND FATALITIES IN PHYSICAL AND- CHILDREN ARE HARMED IN NEW. CITY. EXPOSED TO VIOLENT CRIME IF YOU ARE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER PRESSURE ETIENNE PTS. OR TWO THEN VIOLENTLY HERE AND TO ENGAGE IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. EXPOSURE TO COMMUNITY FUN BUT. INCLUDING WITNESSING SHOOTING GUNS MAKES IT HARDER FOR CHILDREN TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL. HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO HAVE LOWER TEST SCORES AND LOWER RATES OF HIGH SCHOOL GRAD CHIN. MOMS DEMAND ACTION IT ON FOR GUN SAFETY HAVE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL WAYS THE STATE CAN TAKE ACTION TO SOLVE THIS. INVESTING USED. VIOLENCE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS VEHICLE FOR DOING THAT. ID AND FURTHER INVESTMENT AND TELL THE COW THAT AREA. TO SUPPORT SCHOOL IMPLEMENTING THREAT ASSESSMENT. WITH AN EMPHASIS ON TECHNIQUES NOT DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT STUDENTS OF COLOR THIS DOESN'T PROGRAMS LIKE THE VIRGINIA STUDENT THREAT ASSESSMENT GUIDE. SCHOOLS THAT CAN. HELP THEY NEED. THREE THIS IS MY LAST ONE. INVESTORS PROGRAMS THAT ENCOURAGE PARENTS AND FAMILIES TO PRACTICE SAFE STORAGE IF THE LOT OF FOREIGN GONNA LIKE OURS ARE.

EMERGENCIES WHICH ARE IS DUE TO THE DEARTH OF PATIENTS PSYCHIATRIC BEDS JUST WAIT TO ACCESS OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND IN ONE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA THERE IS NO MATTER. FOR H. JUNE THE U. S. SOME MEMBERS. AND I WANT TO THINK THESE AMAZING COLLEAGUES WHO HAVEN'T TO THEIR CAREERS TO SUPPORT CHILDREN AND YOUTH IT. IN THE MALL- HERE TODAY THAT SHARED STORIES AS YOU GUYS ARE INSPIRATION FOR ALL OF OUR WORK THAT WE DO. THERE ARE REALLY THREE THINGS THAT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT TODAY AND THIS. IS AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE EVIDENCE IS BETWEEN. TRUMP. SPITTLE AND- ABOUT. MENTAL HEALTH GOING OR WHERE I AM THE DIRECTOR OF OUR CENTER FOR CHILD AND COMMUNITY HEALTH AT USING ANY OFF CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OAKLAND ALSO A CO LEAD FREEZE SURE IN OUR ADVERSE BECAUSE. STUDY WITH MY COLLEAGUES AT UCSF AND WITH OUR CHURCH IN GENERAL. THERE WAS A MAN IN THE- THESE IT WAS THE INITIAL. TODD LOOKS AND SAYS THAT WAS DONE AT KAISER. K. AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CAN. AND WHAT THIS STUDY WHAT STUDY THAT MADE THE CORRELATION WITH DRAMATIC EXPERIENCES AND HEALTH THIS IS ALSO WE THINK OF. PHYSICAL HEALTH FROM. LEARN WHEN WE INITIALLY ISSUES OF ABUSE NEGLECT AND HOUSEHOLD THIS FUNCTION BUT ARE THE DEFINITIONS OF ADVERSE. WE FOUND IS THAT THIS CHILD EXPERIENCES OR OR MORE OF THESE AT. THREE THERE ARE THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE PHYSICAL. THERE I PLEAD THE- LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN SUBSTANCE USE AN ATTEMPT SUICIDE. THREE TWO TIMES MORE LIKELY TO HAVE LEARNING A BEHAVIORAL ISSUES THEY'VE EXPERIENCED NEVER TRAUMA FOR THEIR FOR THEIR THIRTEEN YEARS OF LIFE. WE BRING THIS DOWN NOT A LEVEL TO WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA WE. 64% OF CALIFORNIANS PRINCE PLEASE WHAT TRUMP. I HAVE EXPERIENCE FOR MORE. THREE TRY UNDERNEATH OUR STAND MIXER BRAIN I PICTURE IT AFFECTS OUR DNA IT OWNS AN ARM YOU KNOW THAT OUR IMMUNE SYSTEMS THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING EASIEST ANY OPTIONAL. IT TOOK SCREEN. KIDS ACES AND TRAUMA THAT CLUES EXPOSURE TO VIOLENT. THE NEIGHBORHOOD HOMES AS WELL AS- WITH. WITH THE KIDS. THE COMPANY WE KNOW OVER 80% OF THEM HAVE XP INSIGNIFICANT TRAUMA AND A HALF. OR MORE THESE ARE VERY YOUNG AVERAGE AGES FIVE AND UP KIDS THAT HAVE EXPERIENCE FOR MORE DIFFERENT TYPES. THE REDUCTION IN THEIR CALL FUNCTION. NEVER CAN IMPAIRMENT BEFORE THEY EVEN GET TO KINDERGARTEN. WHEN WE THINK ABOUT SCHOOL RIGHT. WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT PERHAPS A VIRTUAL HAVE IN COMMON TEN BEFORE YOU CAN STOP INTO THE DOORS OF THE CLASSROOM. TO THE THAT THEY'VE EXPIRY. WE'VE BEEN WORKING HELP PART SERVICE. ACTUALLY PASSED LEGISLATION MANDATES UNIT. FOR EVERY SINGLE CHILD IN. SEVEN MILLION CHILDREN USING THE TOOLS WE CREATE ANY OF SPITTLE CALLED. ROLLING UP PERSONAL READING FOR. IT HAPPENS NEXT YOU FOR YOUR MANY. THIRTY SO I REALLY- JUST ALL NOT PLEASE SUPPORT IN THE FIRST INNING BUT TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE REIMBURSING HEALTH SERVICES- OUR SUPPORTING COMMUNITY BASED IN IRVINE AND- DOES FOOD BANKS. PREVENTION PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE THAT YOU HEARD ABOUT HERE TODAY. REALLY IMPORTANT WE CAN RAISE AN S. INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT SCHOOLS AND HEALTH CARE AN AWARENESS OF NOT WHAT'S WRONG. WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR CHILDREN SEX VIOLENCE THAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A DOCTOR LONG QUESTION FOR YOU ON THE P. I'M. PROVIDES SO ONCE HELD SCREEN FOR THIS. THAT INFORMATION AND HOW DO YOU PRESS THE SITUATION THANK YOU SIR THE QUESTION WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY CLOSELY WITH HEALTH SERVICES IN ORDER TO CREATE ALGORITHMS FOR HOW DO YOU SEE IN WHAT DO YOU DO WHAT. I KNOW IS THAT. ACES ARE ADVERSE EXPERIENCES HAVE A DOES. IT REALLY INSURE POOR HEALTH AND SO IT CHILD CAN EIGHT ONE THREE AND WE- AND SOME POLICY WHETHER EARNING A- AS MAYA AND WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT IF KIDS BRING POSITIVE THE FIRST STEP IS THAT WE- DO YOUR TRIP. PRIMARY CARE. NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A HEART CONVERSATIONS WITH THE FAMILY BE ABLE TO ACCESS. SOME TRAUMA FACTOR BE CARE RATE SO MUCH FUN WHAT MEDICINE IS ABOUT TRUSTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR FAMILIES WE ALSO NEED TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP MY. WE CAN FOR FAMILIES TO COMMUTE BASEMENT OKAY. SERVICES THROUGH MEDICAID TYPE. AND SOME FROM DOWN A MENTAL HEALTH ALL THE STATE AND ALTHOUGH IT'S REALLY. OFF IT'S LIKE NOT- DISTRUSTFUL AND SO IF WE CAN ACTUALLY TO SUPPORT- DRINKS AND GET MORE HOUSING FOR FOLKS THEY'LL BE LESS THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED WEST. ULTIMATE REDUCING EXPOSURE IS OFTEN ONE GENERATION. AND HELLO AND DOCTOR DECKER. THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE IF THE GENERAL NEEDED TOTAL MENTAL HELP. WHAT WOULD PLAY IN AN IDEAL WORLD. IN TOTAL HENCE OF MY. WOULD MEAN THAT JUST LIKE IT'S ESSENTIAL TO HAVE A TRAUMA. HE MET HIS CHIN FIRST A MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDE. INTO A CENTER IS EMBEDDED IN TRAUMA CENTERS AND ELBOW IN A CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE. THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE ROOF SETTING UP AND THAT. SO FOR THAT INITIAL ESPECIALLY. THEN WHAT ABOUT THE LONGER TERM PEACE AS WELL YEAH AS WE- WHICH I DON'T IN MY PROFESSION. IN THEIR BILLS THE- WE WERE- THERE CAN BE CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT AND FOR WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE PROVIDES. OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYMENT THOSE WHO REALLY GET IT. UNDERSTANDING AND CAN REALLY CONTRIBUTE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION GREAT WHEN I THINK OF OUR SECOND PANEL HERE FOR CUSTOM AND WE'LL INVITE OUR THIRD PANEL GROUP OF LOCAL AT A KIDS WORKING ON SOUND AND ENERGIES TO DENNIS LUCIEN'S THESE ISSUES I WANT TO WELCOME OUR- PLEASE INTRODUCE. YEAH THE CHILDREN. IT IS OFTEN USED WHEN YOU TESTIFY. THANK YOU IT'S IN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING. POWERFUL COMPREHENSIVE CONVERSATIONS I AM REALLY EXCITED. I WANT TO START BY SAYING YOU KNOW. THE RIGHT TO LIVE LEARN GROW AND GROW UP FEELING SAFE AND MY FEAR. AND LIGHT EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE ALREADY FELLOW PANEL I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE RACIAL JUST. THE SOLUTIONS THE ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOR YOU. THE POOR CHILDREN AND YOU'VE HEARD IN CHILDREN OF COLOR ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY. COMMA TALKS IT DRESS ACES AND THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO ENCOUNTER AT LEAST ONE SHOT THEN IN THE WHAT. 60% CHILDREN PERCENT OF LATINO. MY EXPERIENCE AT LEAST AT THE VENICE YOU JUST HEARD FROM DOCTOR A LOT ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT ALL 40% OF THEIR WHITE. PEERS HAVE ONLY HEARING IT'S TWO ONE. TO OPERATE AS A MICRO LEVEL MESS LEVEL AND- A LEVEL NOMINA THAT EXTENDS FAR BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE VICTIMS. WITHOUT ALSO UNDERSTANDING. AT THE RACIALIZED WITH RISK LEVELING THE GUN VIOLENCE DEBATE IN CREATING POLICY THERE NEITHER POLITICALLY MEANING OR PRACTICALLY EFFECTIVE PRACTICALLY EFFECTIVE TOWARD THE BROUGHT THE COMPLEX ISSUE OF GUN VIOLENCE AND ITS EFFECT ON YOUTH AND MENTAL HEALTH OUR HEALTH SAFETY NET AS FEELING CURRENT.

DOES IS IT A LITTLE THE STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS. AS ASIAN OUR COMMUNITIES FACE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE TALK ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE AS A- STATE. THE STATE MY LISINOPRIL LOOKING DOWN MY PANTS WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO INTERVENE THE STATE AND THE SYSTEMS IN THE RELATIONSHIP IN THE SYSTEMS. THE CONDITIONS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IN OUR COMMUNITY SO THIS MEANS MORE COMPLICATED WE GOT TO BE MORE MESSY. WE ACTUALLY UP TO ONE OF OUR- SOME UP TO ACTUALLY MOVE BY THE POSITION. AND BUILD UP. THOSE MOST PROXIMATE AND WE SAW SOME FOLKS ON THE PANEL TODAY THE OTHER THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS WE PROVIDE THE HOUSE RACES WE PROVIDE CLINICAL SERVER IS THAT RIGHT. CBT IS BASED OFF. SAY IT WE DIDN'T PROVIDE IT WITHIN A MILIEU OF BEING HERE HONOR OF BEING JUST A STANDARD OF THE- WORRY THAT DOES PROPER SAYS WOULD DO MORE HARM TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE BECAUSE ONLY. ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH WE STILL TALK ABOUT AS INDIVIDUAL. WHAT IS ACTUALLY. HERE THIS ATMOSPHERE. TRAPS AND THAT DISTRESSES WHAT THIS COUNTRY IS BUILT UP WHAT THE COMMUNITIES THAT. NAVIGATING EVERY DAY SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IT'S IN BAD SIDE OF THE HOUSE. IS THAT NOT FIRST EXPERIENCE OF VIOLENCE OR TRAUMA AND THEY MIGHT. ACES AND IT DOESN'T NAVIGATING STRUCTURAL SCHISM I KNOW WE TALKED. WE NAME IT BUT HER CHIN. INDIVIDUAL BEHAVIOR AND WE STILL FOLLOW JUST BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE AND SO WHAT I WOULD PROPOSE AND WE HOPE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS INTERVENTION WAS THE RESEARCH THE POLICY ALL HAS TO COME WORK EXTRA HARD. THOSE OF YOU DOING. I IMPLORE YOU TO STOP USING CONVENTIONAL SPECIAL STANDS FOR- RESEARCH MARKS YOU NEED TO LOOK AT SOME X. YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE LITERATURE. HE JUST LOOKING UP AT ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES TO REFLECT THE ALIVE PEOPLE AND RIGHT NOW EVEN WITH A CALIBER.

HI MY NAME IS OUT ON THE FRONT OF THE CALIFORNIA TERMS- HAVE PERSON TO BUILD PROBABLY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THE KID AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE CHILDREN I SERVED IN THE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN A LEVEL ONE PEDIATRIC TRAUMA CENTER IN JUVENILE DETENTION AND WELFARE. WEREN'T TRICKLE. WHAT TYPE STUFF. BUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. FROM THE PROGRAMS ADMINISTERED EXTRA PROVIDED AS A THERAPIST TO BE DIAGNOSED. YOU HAVE TO RECEIVE FALLEN G. SOMEONE OF A DIFFERENT RACE IN A DIFFERENT CLASS. THE MENTAL CHALLENGE THE SYSTEM IN A VERY SMALL SMALL NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY GET SERVED HAS TO BE ARRESTED NAMED. IT HAS TO BE PUT IN TEXT. OF A HOUSTON A HEALTH CRISIS THAT HAS BEEN FOUR HUNDRED YEARS IN THE MAKING. IT'S S. WE CONSTRUCTED EPIDEMIC DESPAIR SLATE IS. AND DIFFERENT NOW AND EVEN WHEN I WORKED AT OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FORTUNES HOSPITAL EARLY TWO THOUSANDS. BETWEEN OFFERING IT THIS WAY. WHAT WAS THE MOST PROSPEROUS NATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD TOO WHEN THEY WAKE UP ONE MORNING AND FIND THAT TWICE AS MANY OF THE ACTUAL. KILLING SELVES. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND SIX IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN PRESENTED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA FOR SUICIDE ATTEMPT INCREASED DRIVEN 4% BY THE NUMBER OF WHAT WE CALL BUT THAT'S LENGTH OF DAY. THE LENGTH OF STAY IN ALL HOSPITALS ACROSS CALIFORNIA DECREASE BY 35% FOR ALL THIS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF P. MENTAL HELP. WERE INCREASED PERCENT. WAS MEANT IS THREE SIX MILLION OF CUP IS TEN MILLION CHILDREN. ARE ENROLLED IN MEDICARE. LESS THAN 5% RECEIVED ANYTHING LAST YEAR IT IS ACCURATE. TO CHARACTERIZE WHEN USED. ADD A COMMENT SYSTEM THIS WAY MORE IT'S GETTING THOSE WHO DO GET IT. AND THE WRONG KIND. CALIFORNIA IS ON THE OF ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS THE CHALLENGE. TRUE THAT RACIST CULTURE STRIP. PRESS. AS TODAY INCREMENTALISM HIS PART SHIN. CALIFORNIA HAS THE LEAST EXPECTED IN ITS RECENT CALLAHAN PRO WHICH IS A PROPOSAL TO FUNDAMENTALLY REFORM MEDICAID. NO SIR SHOULD BE REMOVED AS AN EBELING. CONDITION THANK YOU PS REIMBURSEMENT. IS IN A CRITICAL MORE TOWARDS CREATING MORE JUST AND EQUITABLE SYSTEM BUT IT IS ONE OF ONLY THREE THINGS I'LL NAME IN MY LAST MINUTE. THE FIRST THING WE MUST DO FORM OF MEDICAID IS DRAMATIC EXPAND. THE STATE'S. TRACK FORTY SECOND THE NATION AND SPENDING PER CHILD. THE HIGHEST TAX BASE IN THE NATION. SO THE OPERATOR HER EARLIER ABOUT VICTIMS OF THEM SHOULD BE. NOT MORE POLITE TO A MEDICAID PROGRAM. SURE CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS TREE WITH A MAGICAL CHRISTMAS TREE ORNAMENTS HUNG UP. SIXTY THREE POP SIXTY FOUR PROP TO. FIFTY STAND PUBLIC FINANCE. SECOND WE MUST WE FIND THE BENEFIT SO PLACES LIKE RIGHT THE FUNDING. I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE A DIAGNOSIS AND YOU SHOULD HAVE TO BE A CLINICIAN WHAT WE KNOW. IS THIS HUMAN CONNECTION. CONNECTION OTHER PEOPLE WITH COMMON LIVED EXPERIENCE. AND WE KNOW THIS LOOK AT THE RECORD. TODAY TONIGHT TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS THIS NATION WILL GET TOGETHER WITH NO CLINICIAN IN THE ROOM. ONLY BY THEIR COMICS TO SUFFERING AND MAGIC WILL HAPPEN. WHERE IS THE RECOVERY MOVEMENT FOR BEING BROUGHT A BLACK ICON FOR BEING A NEW MOM FOR BEING A NEW COMER FOR HAVING YOUR FIRST JOB. PEOPLE CAN SOLVE THEIR OWN PROBLEMS GIVEN. SURE. AND CAN ACTIVITY TO SELL. FIVE DRESS ARE ARE. PUBLIC SYSTEM. THE SOMETIMES EVEN OUT OF GOOD INTENTIONS PATRICK. AND DISCONNECTION.
