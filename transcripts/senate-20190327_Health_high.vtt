YEAR.

00:49:31.868 --> 00:49:33.036
I WANT TO FIRST EXPRESS OUR

00:49:33.103 --> 00:49:34.504
GRATITUDE TO SENATOR BELL FOR

00:49:34.571 --> 00:49:35.572
INTRODUCING THIS IMPORTANT

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:37.941
LEGISLATION AND HIS LEADERSHIP

00:49:38.008 --> 00:49:38.575
ON CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH IN

00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:40.677
GENERAL -- WE SEE THIS BILL IS

00:49:40.744 --> 00:49:41.878
AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THE KIND

00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:43.480
OF INNOVATIVE AND SOLUTION

00:49:43.547 --> 00:49:45.115
FOCUSED INVESTMENTS THAT WE NEED

00:49:45.182 --> 00:49:46.983
AND CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS THIS

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:48.952
CRITICAL ISSUE OF YOUTH MENTAL

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:50.320
HEALTH.

00:49:50.387 --> 00:49:51.288
SO I WANT TO UNDERSCORE AND

00:49:51.355 --> 00:49:52.389
REITERATE SOME OF THE DATA THAT

00:49:52.456 --> 00:49:54.224
THE SENATOR ALREADY SHARED WITH

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:54.758
YOU.

00:49:54.825 --> 00:49:55.992
BUT CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE

00:49:56.059 --> 00:49:57.160
HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE MOST

00:49:57.227 --> 00:49:58.628
CRITICAL TIME FOR IDENTIFYING

00:49:58.695 --> 00:49:59.863
AND ADDRESSING EMERGING MENTAL

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:02.599
HEALTH NEEDS. 50% OF ALL CHRONIC

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:03.834
MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS BEGIN BY

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:08.138
AGE FOURTEEN AND 75% BY AGE.

00:50:08.205 --> 00:50:09.339
TWENTY FIVE AT THE SAME TIME

00:50:09.406 --> 00:50:10.707
THAT ALL OF THAT DATA IS TRUE

00:50:10.774 --> 00:50:12.275
WE'RE SEEING THAT MENTAL HEALTH

00:50:12.342 --> 00:50:13.744
NEEDS FOR YOUTH ARE INCREASING

00:50:13.810 --> 00:50:15.579
IN BOTH PREVALENCE AND ACUITY AT

00:50:15.645 --> 00:50:17.180
ALARMING RATES.

00:50:17.247 --> 00:50:18.448
THE RATE OF SELF REPORTED NO

00:50:18.515 --> 00:50:19.716
HEALTH NEEDS AMONGST CALIFORNIA

00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:20.817
ADOLESCENCE HAS INCREASED BY

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:23.520
OVER 60% IN THE LAST DECADE.

00:50:23.587 --> 00:50:24.521
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S

00:50:24.588 --> 00:50:26.590
BEEN A 2100% INCREASE IN SUICIDE

00:50:26.656 --> 00:50:30.660
RATES AMONG GIRLS AGES.

00:50:30.727 --> 00:50:31.628
TEN TO FOURTEEN DESPITE THE AND

00:50:31.695 --> 00:50:33.630
AS THE SENATOR SAID YOU OF ALL

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:34.731
YOUTH DIAGNOSED WITH A MENTAL

00:50:34.798 --> 00:50:37.067
HEALTH CONDITION NEARLY TWO

00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:37.567
THIRDS ARE NOT RECEIVING

00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:38.235
TREATMENT.

00:50:38.301 --> 00:50:39.836
SO SOMETHING'S GOING ON AND WE

00:50:39.903 --> 00:50:40.937
NEED MORE SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS

00:50:41.004 --> 00:50:42.439
THIS.

00:50:42.506 --> 00:50:43.540
SENATEBECAUSE IN SUPPORT OF

00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:44.541
THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT

00:50:44.608 --> 00:50:45.742
ADOPTS AN APPROACH TO MENTAL

00:50:45.809 --> 00:50:48.145
HEALTH THAT WE KNOW CAN WORK.

00:50:48.211 --> 00:50:50.013
SO OUR AGENCY STARTED THIRTY

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.214
FIVE YEARS AGO MOSTLY AS A

00:50:51.281 --> 00:50:52.549
RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT PROVIDER

00:50:52.616 --> 00:50:54.084
BUT HAVE INCREASINGLY DEVOTED

00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:56.319
OURSELVES -- IN EVERY WAY TO

00:50:56.386 --> 00:50:57.988
COMMUNITY BASED IN SCHOOL BASED

00:50:58.054 --> 00:50:59.589
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:00.657
IN RECOGNITION OF THE

00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:02.359
FUNDAMENTAL PREMISE THAT THIS

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:03.994
LEGISLATION IS BASED UPON WHICH

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.295
IS THAT MENTAL HEALTH CARE MUST

00:51:05.362 --> 00:51:07.030
BE DELIVERED IN A LOCATION THAT

00:51:07.097 --> 00:51:08.665
IS EASY FOR YOU TO ACCESS.

00:51:08.732 --> 00:51:10.167
DELIVERED IN A MANNER THAT MAKE

00:51:10.233 --> 00:51:13.270
MINIMIZES STICK MY AND IS YOUTH

00:51:13.336 --> 00:51:14.404
DESIGNED AND YOUTH LED.

00:51:14.471 --> 00:51:16.540
SO THIS ONE STOP SHOP DROP IN

00:51:16.606 --> 00:51:18.475
CENTER IDEA THAT PUT FORWARD BY

00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:19.743
THIS BILL WOULD ACCOMPLISH THOSE

00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:20.710
OBJECTIVES.

00:51:20.777 --> 00:51:22.212
FIRST IT ALLOWS CENTERS TO BE

00:51:22.279 --> 00:51:23.980
LOCATED IN PLACES WHERE YOUNG

00:51:24.047 --> 00:51:25.615
PEOPLE ALREADY ARE AND FEEL

00:51:25.682 --> 00:51:27.384
COMFORTABLE AS OPPOSED TO ASKING

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:29.352
THEM TO GO ELSEWHERE SOMETIMES

00:51:29.419 --> 00:51:31.221
DURING IN CONVENIENT HOURS TO

00:51:31.288 --> 00:51:32.589
ACCESS SERVICES.

00:51:32.656 --> 00:51:33.723
BY REMOVING THOSE TYPES OF

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:35.492
LOGISTICAL BARRIERS TO CARE WE

00:51:35.559 --> 00:51:38.662
KNOW THAT THE RATES OF ACCESS

00:51:38.728 --> 00:51:40.464
CAN GO UP SO STUDIES HAVE SHOWN

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:41.431
THAT YOUTH ARE MORE LIKELY TO

00:51:41.498 --> 00:51:42.933
ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:45.902
EXAMPLE IN SCHOOL.

00:51:45.969 --> 00:51:46.903
THAN OTHER LOCATIONS.

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:47.737
SECOND THE DESIGN OF THESE

00:51:47.804 --> 00:51:48.905
CENTERS WOULD BE LED BY TEENS

00:51:48.972 --> 00:51:50.040
AND YOUNG ADULTS WHICH HELPS

00:51:50.106 --> 00:51:51.174
ENSURE THAT THE SERVICES ARE

00:51:51.241 --> 00:51:52.776
DELIVERED IN A MANNER THAT IS

00:51:52.843 --> 00:51:54.611
APPROPRIATE AND NEEDED AND

00:51:54.678 --> 00:51:55.679
ABSENT OF STIGMA.

00:51:55.745 --> 00:51:57.647
SO IMAGINE EXPERIENCING ANXIETY

00:51:57.714 --> 00:51:58.982
AND DEPRESSION AS A YOUNG PERSON

00:51:59.049 --> 00:52:00.550
TODAY KNOWING THAT THERE'S A

00:52:00.617 --> 00:52:02.886
PLACE YOU CAN GO ANY TIME WHERE

00:52:02.953 --> 00:52:05.522
IT'S NOT OKAY BUT MAYBE EVEN

00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:06.990
COOL TO ASK FOR HELP.

00:52:07.057 --> 00:52:07.991
THAT WOULD BE FUNDAMENTALLY

00:52:08.058 --> 00:52:09.659
DIFFERENT ON THE TYPE OF

00:52:09.726 --> 00:52:11.094
APPROACH WE OFTEN SEE TODAY.

00:52:11.161 --> 00:52:12.128
SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT YOUNG

00:52:12.195 --> 00:52:14.030
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT IS NEEDED AND

00:52:14.097 --> 00:52:15.499
WE SHOULD FOLLOW THEIR LEAD.

00:52:15.565 --> 00:52:16.566
SENATE BECAUSE COMMITTED TO THE

00:52:16.633 --> 00:52:18.568
VISION AND INTENTION OF SB

00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:19.903
TWELVE AND FINDS THAT THE VALUE

00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:21.505
OF MAKING SERVICES EASIER FOR

00:52:21.571 --> 00:52:23.306
YOU TO ACCESS WOULD BE

00:52:23.373 --> 00:52:26.009
IMMEASURABLE FOR OUR STATE -- WE

00:52:26.076 --> 00:52:27.577
BELIEVE THAT INVESTING IN MODELS

00:52:27.644 --> 00:52:28.845
LIKE THIS WOULD BE A HUGE STEP

00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:30.247
FORWARD FOR CALIFORNIA AND

00:52:30.313 --> 00:52:31.681
MAKING SURE THAT KIDS GET WHAT

00:52:31.748 --> 00:52:34.017
THEY NEED -- WHERE THEY NEED AT

00:52:34.084 --> 00:52:36.786
WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST WE ARE

00:52:36.853 --> 00:52:38.922
DRIVE VOTE ON SB TOUGH?

00:52:38.989 --> 00:52:40.156
THANK RICHARD MEMBERS TOBY EWING

00:52:40.223 --> 00:52:41.191
WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

00:52:41.258 --> 00:52:42.325
OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

00:52:42.392 --> 00:52:43.560
COMMISSION.

00:52:43.627 --> 00:52:45.428
I KNOW THE LAST FOUR FIVE YEARS

00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:46.129
THAT I'VE BEEN WITH THE

00:52:46.196 --> 00:52:47.497
COMMISSION WE SPENT A LOT OF

00:52:47.564 --> 00:52:48.899
TIME TALKING TO YOUNG PEOPLE.

00:52:48.965 --> 00:52:50.300
AND WE TALK WITH THEM ABOUT THE

00:52:50.367 --> 00:52:51.701
CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE IN

00:52:51.768 --> 00:52:53.303
ACCESSING CARE AND SO YOU HEARD

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:54.971
SOME OF THE DATA AND I THINK THE

00:52:55.038 --> 00:52:55.539
DATA ARE WELL KNOWN AT THIS

00:52:55.605 --> 00:52:56.873
POINT THAT.

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:58.074
AT THIS STAGE IN AND AND AN

00:52:58.141 --> 00:52:59.209
INDIVIDUAL'S LIFE IS WHEN WE

00:52:59.276 --> 00:53:01.278
OFTEN SEE THE KINDS OF STRESS OR

00:53:01.344 --> 00:53:03.213
TRAUMA OR THE CHALLENGES REALLY

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:05.982
COMING OUT IN HEALTH CHALLENGES.

00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:07.350
WE ALSO SEE QUITE OFTEN A

00:53:07.417 --> 00:53:09.219
FUNDAMENTAL MISMATCH.

00:53:09.286 --> 00:53:10.120
BETWEEN THE NEEDS OF YOUNG

00:53:10.186 --> 00:53:11.788
PEOPLE AND THE SERVICES THAT ARE

00:53:11.855 --> 00:53:13.023
DESIGNED TO HELP THEM OR THAT

00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:14.658
ARE IN PLACE TO HELP THEM BUT I

00:53:14.724 --> 00:53:15.258
SHOULDN'T SAY DESIGNED TO HELP

00:53:15.325 --> 00:53:16.426
THEM.

00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:17.961
IN IN IN IN IN MANY WAYS I'D SAY

01:19:36.838 --> 01:19:38.073
FLAVORS WERE NOT AVAILABLE.

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:39.674
SECOND FLAVORS MASS THE RISKS

01:19:39.741 --> 01:19:41.076
THAT ARE INHERENT IN TOBACCO

01:19:41.143 --> 01:19:42.777

NICOTINE.

01:19:50.485 --> 01:19:52.621
AS THAT WOULD BE FOUND IN ONE TO

01:19:52.687 --> 01:19:54.756
TWO PACKS OF CIGARETTES KIDS ARE

01:19:54.823 --> 01:19:56.391
ADDICTED TO THESE PRODUCTS AND

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:20.749
WITHOUT THEM.

01:20:20.815 --> 01:20:21.983
THE EVIDENCE IS CLEAR THE

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:22.584
FLAVORS ATTRACT KIDS

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:23.919

I'VE DONE FOR THE LAST TWENTY

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:51.079
YEARS.

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:52.414
LET ME MAKE ONE THING CLEAR IN

01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:54.182
THE FIRST PLACE THE THE MOST

01:20:54.249 --> 01:20:55.784
IMPORTANT THING THAT THE SENATE

01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:57.552
CAN DO THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN

01:20:57.619 --> 01:21:00.388
DO. TO PROTECT OUR HEALTH IS TO

01:21:00.455 --> 01:21:02.791
GET RID OF FLAVORS AND TOBACCO.

01:21:02.857 --> 01:21:04.426
THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU PUT

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:05.827
FLAVORS IN THE BACK -- IT HELPS

01:21:05.894 --> 01:21:08.730
TO POISON TO GO DOWN EASIER

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:09.965
THERE'S NO MISTAKE ABOUT THAT

01:21:10.031 --> 01:21:11.299
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE JEWEL

01:21:11.366 --> 01:21:12.634
EXPLOSION THAT EVERYBODY'S

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.636

IT'S A FLAVOR EXPLOSION WE'VE

01:21:17.505 --> 01:21:19.107
BEEN AWARE OF THIS EXPLOSION FOR

01:21:19.174 --> 01:21:20.942
SOME TIME UNFORTUNATELY IT'S

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:23.278
BEEN CONCENTRATED AROUND MENTAL

01:21:23.345 --> 01:21:25.146
WE KNOW THAT MENTAL HAS AN

01:21:25.213 --> 01:21:26.881
ANESTHETIC EFFECT ALLOWS DEEPER

01:21:26.948 --> 01:21:27.682
INHALATION.

01:21:27.749 --> 01:21:29.317
THE DEEPER YOU INHALE THE MORE

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:31.920
TOXINS AND NICOTINE YOU TAKE IN

01:21:31.987 --> 01:21:33.121
THE MORE NEGATIVE AND TALKS AND

01:21:33.188 --> 01:21:33.922

PRESENCE HERE TODAY WAS

01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:07.922
NECESSARY -- AT THE AGE OF

FIFTEEN I WAS INTRODUCED TO

01:32:08.756 --> 01:32:10.491
TOBACCO THROUGH A FRIEND WHICH

01:32:10.558 --> 01:32:11.893
DEVELOPED INTO A VERY DEEP

01:32:11.959 --> 01:32:12.927
PROTECTION.

01:32:12.994 --> 01:32:14.562

MY FAMILY AS I COME FROM A LINE

01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:18.399
SMOKED CIGARETTES.

01:32:18.466 --> 01:32:20.301
MY ADDICTION LASTED A TOTAL OF

01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:22.003
NINE YEARS AS I WAS UNABLE TO

01:32:22.069 --> 01:32:27.575
QUIT CIGARETTES REGARDLESS OF MY

01:32:27.642 --> 01:32:29.410
MANY ATTEMPTS -- WHEN JULES

01:32:29.477 --> 01:32:30.411
INTRODUCED AS A NEW PRODUCT I

01:32:30.478 --> 01:32:32.113
WAS IMMEDIATELY ABLE TO KICK THE

01:32:32.179 --> 01:32:32.513
DISGUSTING HABIT?

01:32:32.580 --> 01:32:34.081
I'VE NOT HAD A SINGLE CIGARETTES

01:32:34.148 --> 01:32:35.850
SINCE THE INCEPTION OF TOOL --

01:32:35.917 --> 01:32:37.618
WHEN I WAS A SMOKER I WAS NOT

01:32:37.685 --> 01:32:39.053
CAPABLE BEING HEALTHY NOR WAS I

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:40.755
ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN PHYSICAL

01:32:40.821 --> 01:32:42.957
ACTIVITY -- TIME I LOST MY SENSE

01:32:43.024 --> 01:32:45.126
OF SMELL -- MY ABILITY TO TASTE

01:32:45.192 --> 01:32:47.028
FOODS DIMINISHED AND TO MY

01:32:47.094 --> 01:32:49.497
AMAZEMENT I HAVE FULLY RECOVERED

01:32:49.563 --> 01:32:51.799
FROM THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS HE

01:32:51.866 --> 01:32:53.167
CAUSED BY CIGARETTES IN MY

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:56.871
OPINION -- WHEN OF?

01:32:56.938 --> 01:32:58.372
I BEGIN USING THIS PRODUCT I WAS

01:32:58.439 --> 01:32:59.340

01:33:01.776 --> 01:33:03.344
TRYING TO DISTANCE MYSELF FROM

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:04.845
BEING ASSOCIATED WITH TOBACCO.

01:33:04.912 --> 01:33:05.913
THESE FLAVORED PRODUCTS WERE

01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:07.348
INSTRUMENTAL IN MY ABILITY TO

01:33:07.415 --> 01:33:09.383
STOP SMOKING CIGARETTES I CAN

01:33:09.450 --> 01:33:10.785

NEXT STEP INCLUDING TOBACCO -- I

01:33:18.693 --> 01:33:19.593
WOULD LIKE IT TO BE KNOWN HOW

IMPORTANT TOOL HAS BEEN IN THE

01:33:21.062 --> 01:33:22.229
HORRIBLE PROCESS.

01:33:22.296 --> 01:33:24.231
OF QUITTING CIGARETTES I WAS A

01:33:24.298 --> 01:33:25.466
TEENAGER WHEN I BEGAN SMOKING

01:33:25.533 --> 01:33:27.101

I WAS ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS

01:33:43.217 --> 01:33:44.185
SOLELY BECAUSE OF MY TRANSITION

SPECIFICALLY TALKS ABOUT THIS

01:51:06.793 --> 01:51:07.927
THE IMPORTANCE OF FLAVORS AND

01:51:07.994 --> 01:51:09.396
SWITCHING.

01:51:09.462 --> 01:51:10.430
THAT WE'VE SEEN AND THIS

01:51:10.497 --> 01:51:12.599
PARTICULAR SURVEY WAS ALMOST TEN

01:51:12.665 --> 01:51:14.868
THOUSAND ADULT USERS AND WE SAW

01:51:14.934 --> 01:51:17.203
IN THAT SURVEY THAT IF YOU IF

01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:18.505
THOSE SMOKERS WERE USING.

01:51:18.571 --> 01:51:20.340
SOLELY A NON TOBACCO FLAVOR THEY

01:51:20.407 --> 01:51:24.077
HAD A 30% INCREASE IN THEIR FULL

01:51:24.144 --> 01:51:24.477
SWITCHING RIGHT.

01:51:24.544 --> 01:51:25.345
WILL SWITCHING IS INCREDIBLY

01:51:25.412 --> 01:51:27.247
IMPORTANT FOR HARM REDUCTION YOU

01:51:27.313 --> 01:51:28.348
GET THE PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFIT

01:51:28.415 --> 01:51:29.749
WHEN YOU'RE NOT EVEN TAKING A

01:51:29.816 --> 01:51:31.051
PUFF OF A CIGARETTE.

01:51:31.117 --> 01:51:33.219
SO WE HAVE SEEN IN OUR DATA AND

01:51:33.286 --> 01:51:34.821
WE HEAR ANECDOTALLY WITH WITH

01:51:34.888 --> 01:51:35.722
SMOKERS HAVE SWITCHED ALL THE

01:51:35.789 --> 01:51:36.089
TIME.

01:51:36.156 --> 01:51:37.424
THAT FLAVORS ARE CRITICALLY

01:51:37.490 --> 01:51:39.325
IMPORTANT TO THEIR SWITCHING I

01:51:39.392 --> 01:51:40.794
KNOW IT'S NOT INTUITIVE.

01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:43.563
I HAVE A MENTOR MYSELF WHO WAS A

01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:45.732
LONG TIME SMOKER HE SENT ME AN

01:51:45.799 --> 01:51:48.501
EMAIL AND JEN END OF JANUARY OF

01:51:48.568 --> 01:51:49.102
TWENTY EIGHTEEN SAYING HUGHES

01:51:49.169 --> 01:51:50.904
MANGO.

01:51:50.970 --> 01:51:51.805
HE SAID IT WAS THIRTY DAYS SINCE

01:51:51.871 --> 01:51:53.339
YOU HAVE A CIGARETTE AND IT WAS

01:51:53.406 --> 01:51:53.973
THE LONGEST YOU'VE GONE WITHOUT

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:56.242
A CIGARETTE SINCE NINETEEN

01:51:56.309 --> 01:51:57.143
SEVENTY SIX TO THIS DAY HE STILL

01:51:57.210 --> 01:51:58.111
HAD A CIGARETTE.

01:51:58.178 --> 01:51:59.045
AND FOR THOSE SMOKERS YOU'VE

01:51:59.112 --> 01:51:59.646
HEARD FROM IN THE ROOM IT'S AN

01:51:59.712 --> 01:52:01.214
INCREDIBLY EMPOWERING THING FOR

01:52:01.281 --> 01:52:01.414
THEM.

01:52:01.481 --> 01:52:08.188
AND WE ALSO THINK VERY IMPORTANT

01:52:08.254 --> 01:52:11.024
FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE --

01:52:11.091 --> 01:52:12.058
WITH RESPECT TO YOUR SECOND

01:52:12.125 --> 01:52:13.726
QUESTION IS A GREAT QUESTION --

01:52:13.793 --> 01:52:14.794
I PERSONALLY STRUGGLED WITH IT --

01:52:14.861 --> 01:52:17.297
AND WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT --

01:52:17.363 --> 01:52:18.832
THAT OSHA HAS A 35% INVESTMENT

01:52:18.898 --> 01:52:21.000
IN THE COMPANY AFTER THEY GET

01:52:21.067 --> 01:52:21.701
THROUGH ANTI TRUST APPROVALS

01:52:21.768 --> 01:52:23.036
THEY'LL HAVE THREE SEATS ON THE

01:52:23.103 --> 01:52:23.903
BOARD THERE WILL NEVER HAVE A

01:52:23.970 --> 01:52:24.637
CONTROLLING VOTE ON THE BOARD.

01:52:24.704 --> 01:52:25.271
AND THERE ARE ADDITIONAL

01:52:25.338 --> 01:52:26.439
PROVISIONS IN THE CONTRACT TO

01:52:26.506 --> 01:52:27.974
PREVENT THEM FROM THAT CONTROL

01:52:28.041 --> 01:52:28.775
POSITION.

01:52:28.842 --> 01:52:29.742
THE REASON THAT WE UNDERTOOK

01:52:29.809 --> 01:52:32.112
THIS INVESTMENT WAS IN ORDER TO

01:52:32.178 --> 01:52:35.081
ACCESS TO THEIR LIST OF

01:52:35.148 --> 01:52:36.916
SEVENTEEN MILLION -- AGE

01:52:36.983 --> 01:52:38.618
VERIFIED ADULT SMOKERS TO WHOM

01:52:38.685 --> 01:52:40.553
WE CAN DIRECTLY MARKET -- WE

01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:42.255
WILL BE PUTTING INSERTS INTO

01:52:42.322 --> 01:52:44.057
PACKS OF MARLBOROS SAYING NEXT

01:52:44.124 --> 01:52:44.991
TIME TRY JEWEL AND MAKE THE

01:52:45.058 --> 01:52:48.027
SWITCH -- AN INCREASE IN PROVED --

01:52:48.094 --> 01:52:49.629
POSITIONING IN STORES AND IT'S

01:52:49.696 --> 01:52:50.897
REALLY IMPORTANT RETAIL IS

01:52:50.964 --> 01:52:51.998
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

01:52:52.065 --> 01:52:54.234
SMOKERS GO GET THEIR CIGARETTES

01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:55.802
AT RETAIL.

01:52:55.869 --> 01:52:57.103
AND IF WE WANT THEM TO SWITCH TO

01:52:57.170 --> 01:52:58.538
A LESS HARMFUL ALTERNATIVE IT

01:52:58.605 --> 01:52:59.539
NEEDS TO BE RIGHT THERE NEXT TO

01:52:59.606 --> 01:53:00.206
IT.

01:53:00.273 --> 01:53:00.773
SO THOSE ARE THE REASONS WE

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:01.908
UNDERTOOK I COMPLETELY

01:53:01.975 --> 01:53:04.377
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN HAPPY TO

01:53:04.444 --> 01:53:05.778
TALK FURTHER ABOUT IT AS WELL --

01:53:05.845 --> 01:53:08.515
BUT WE'VE THOUGHT VERY HARD

01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:09.115
ABOUT IT IN THE CONTRACT THANK

HAVE YOUR WITNESSES AT THE TABLE

01:53:17.357 --> 01:53:19.893
THEY WANT ACCESS TO HELP ANSWER

01:53:19.959 --> 01:53:22.495
QUESTIONS -- THEY CAN.

01:53:22.562 --> 01:53:24.697
THE ONES WHO TESTIFIED WE CAN

01:53:24.764 --> 01:53:26.599

THANK YOU OKAY YEAH ALL RIGHT --

01:53:29.435 --> 01:53:31.638

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ONE

01:53:34.908 --> 01:53:35.742
THINK THE AUTHORS FOR BRINGING

01:53:35.808 --> 01:53:37.343
THIS FORWARD ALL THE WITNESSES

01:53:37.410 --> 01:53:37.944
FOR BEING HERE.

01:53:38.011 --> 01:53:39.212
MY FIRST QUESTION IS FOR THE

01:53:39.279 --> 01:53:39.579
GENTLEMAN WHO.

01:53:39.646 --> 01:53:42.615
SWITCHED FROM COMBUSTIBLE

01:53:42.682 --> 01:53:44.083
TOBACCO TO VAPING

01:53:44.150 --> 01:53:48.087
ARE YOU STILL USING THE PRODUCTS.

01:53:48.154 --> 01:53:48.955
YES SIR IN ARE THE PRODUCTS THAT

01:53:49.022 --> 01:53:49.489
YOU USED TO THEY CONTAIN

01:53:49.556 --> 01:53:51.791
NICOTINE.

01:53:51.858 --> 01:53:52.058
YES SIR.

01:53:52.125 --> 01:53:52.792
IS IT FAIR TO SAY YOU'RE

01:53:52.859 --> 01:53:55.128
ADDICTED TO NICOTINE.

01:53:55.195 --> 01:53:56.796
YES AND DO YOU KNOW OF ANY

01:53:56.863 --> 01:53:58.264
HEALTH BENEFITS TO NICOTINE

01:53:58.331 --> 01:54:00.300
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

01:54:00.366 --> 01:54:01.968
I WILL MENTION THAT -- AS SOON

01:54:02.035 --> 01:54:03.670
AS TOOL CAME OUT WITH A LOWER

01:54:03.736 --> 01:54:05.438
NICOTINE STRENGTH I IMMEDIATELY

01:54:05.505 --> 01:54:07.440
TRANSITION TO THAT AND HAVE HAD

01:54:07.507 --> 01:54:08.708
NO PROBLEMS SINCE THEN IT'S BEEN

01:54:08.775 --> 01:54:08.908
EASY.

01:54:08.975 --> 01:54:11.578
SO I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING

01:54:11.644 --> 01:54:12.912
TO LESSEN THE NICOTINE AMOUNT AS

01:54:12.979 --> 01:54:15.248
TIME GOES ON BUT IT WAS NOT HARD

01:54:15.315 --> 01:54:16.182
FOR ME TO SWITCH TO THE LOWER

01:54:16.249 --> 01:54:17.450
NICOTINE LEVEL IN Q. IN YOUR

01:54:17.517 --> 01:54:18.084
WHERE THAT SOME OF THE JEWEL

01:54:18.151 --> 01:54:20.220
PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING USED BY

01:54:20.286 --> 01:54:23.389
CHILDREN -- MIDDLE SCHOOL KIDS

01:54:23.456 --> 01:54:25.024
HAVE A HIGHER CONCENTRATION OF

01:54:25.091 --> 01:54:28.895
NICOTINE THAN CIGARETTE PRODUCTS

01:54:28.962 --> 01:54:31.598
THAN CIGARETTES -- YES I THINK

01:54:31.664 --> 01:54:34.801
THAT'S A LITTLE HARD. TO TO THE

01:54:34.867 --> 01:54:36.803
STATE POLICE YES ON BECAUSE IF

01:54:36.869 --> 01:54:39.505
YOU TAKE ONE INDIVIDUAL -- AND

01:54:39.572 --> 01:54:40.707
THAT'S YOUR ONLY HIT ALL DAY

01:54:40.773 --> 01:54:41.608
THAT NO THAT'S NOT A STRONGER

01:54:41.674 --> 01:54:42.709
MAN A NICOTINE THAN SMOKING A

01:54:42.775 --> 01:54:43.443
CIGARETTE.

01:54:43.509 --> 01:54:44.711
IN HOW MANY YOUNG PEOPLE DO YOU

01:54:44.777 --> 01:54:46.746
THINK TAKE.

01:54:46.813 --> 01:54:47.880
ONE HIT A DAY I HONESTLY DON'T

01:54:47.947 --> 01:54:48.982
KNOW BUT I CAN REFLECT MY OWN

01:54:49.048 --> 01:54:50.717
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WHEN I BEGAN

01:54:50.783 --> 01:54:51.784
SMOKING I DIDN'T JUST FULLY GO

01:54:51.851 --> 01:54:53.386
INTO SMOKING TWENTY CIGARETTES A

01:54:53.453 --> 01:54:54.254
DAY.

01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:56.022
BUT BY THE END OF MY HABIT I WAS

01:54:56.089 --> 01:54:56.656
SMOKING THIRTY PLUS CIGARETTES A

01:54:56.723 --> 01:54:58.891
DAY -- BUT AT THE BEGINNING IT

01:54:58.958 --> 01:54:59.726
WAS.

01:54:59.792 --> 01:55:01.527
SOMETHING LIKE ONE TO FIVE

01:55:01.594 --> 01:55:03.129
CIGARETTES A DAY SO I WOULDN'T I

01:55:03.196 --> 01:55:06.032
WOULDN'T SAY IT WAS UNREASONABLE

01:55:06.099 --> 01:55:06.799
TO SAY THAT.

01:55:06.866 --> 01:55:11.204
JEWEL SMOKERS AS DOES TEENAGERS

01:55:11.271 --> 01:55:15.808
SMOKE -- AND THE DATE OF A FAIR

01:55:15.875 --> 01:55:18.878
AMOUNT LESS THAN ADULTS SMOKE

01:55:18.945 --> 01:55:20.980
BUT NEIGHBORS.

01:55:21.047 --> 01:55:23.049
YOU DO BELIEVE NICOTINE TO BE AN

01:55:23.116 --> 01:55:25.485
ADDICTIVE PRODUCT ABSOLUTELY.

01:55:25.551 --> 01:55:26.819
SENT MY CHILDREN NEED TO VAPE

01:55:26.886 --> 01:55:31.357
WHEN THEY'RE IN SCHOOL -- I

01:55:31.424 --> 01:55:32.191
DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S WHY THEY

01:55:32.258 --> 01:55:33.926
THEY FEEL THE NEED TO BE PUT IN

01:55:33.993 --> 01:55:36.396
SCHOOL OR COULD BE PEER PRESSURE

01:55:36.462 --> 01:55:38.231
EXCEPT -- FOR WHEN I WAS STILL

01:55:38.298 --> 01:55:39.799
GOING TO SCHOOL IT IT WAS RIGHT

01:55:39.866 --> 01:55:40.366
IN THE TRANSITION PERIOD OF

01:55:40.433 --> 01:55:40.833
WHERE.

01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:42.635
PEOPLE WERE STILL KIND OF COOL

01:55:42.702 --> 01:55:43.870
IF YOU SMOKE CIGARETTES AND BY

01:55:43.936 --> 01:55:45.571
KIND OF BY THE END OF MY HIGH

01:55:45.638 --> 01:55:49.942
SCHOOL LIFE IT WAS NOT COOL AT

01:55:50.009 --> 01:55:51.110
ALL SIX HUNDRED SO.

01:55:51.177 --> 01:55:52.178
I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY IN

01:55:52.245 --> 01:55:56.049
FOR THE DOCTOR FROM UNIVERSITY

01:55:56.115 --> 01:55:58.918
OF CALIFORNIA.

01:55:58.985 --> 01:55:59.786
MY QUESTION FOR YOU SIR IS IF

01:55:59.852 --> 01:56:05.024
YOU KNOW -- ARE MORE SMOKERS

01:56:05.091 --> 01:56:06.726
BENEFITING THROUGH VAPING TO

01:56:06.793 --> 01:56:09.429
STOP THEIR THEIR ADDICTION.

01:56:09.495 --> 01:56:11.664
TO TOBACCO PRODUCTS.

01:56:11.731 --> 01:56:13.766
OR OR MORE YOUNG PEOPLE USING

01:56:13.833 --> 01:56:15.401
THEIR PRODUCTS AND BECOMING

01:56:15.468 --> 01:56:16.536
ADDICTED TO NICOTINE.

01:56:16.602 --> 01:56:18.271
WELL I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT

01:56:18.338 --> 01:56:19.806
BOTH SIDES OF THIS -- NUMBER ONE

01:56:19.872 --> 01:56:21.407
THERE ARE NUMEROUS STUDIES THAT

01:56:21.474 --> 01:56:22.442
SHOW THAT PEOPLE THAT USE

01:56:22.508 --> 01:56:24.143
ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES TRANSITION

01:56:24.210 --> 01:56:25.278
TO REGULAR CIGARETTES WE HAVE A

01:56:25.345 --> 01:56:26.746
LOT OF STUDIES ON THAT WE WILL

01:56:26.813 --> 01:56:27.680
SHARE WITH YOU.

01:56:27.747 --> 01:56:30.016
THAT MATERIAL SECONDLY AND

01:56:30.083 --> 01:56:31.317
UNFORTUNATELY THE SECOND PART OF

01:56:31.384 --> 01:56:33.286
YOUR QUESTION WE KNOW THAT THE I

01:56:33.353 --> 01:56:34.620
MEAN THE STATISTICS ARE

01:56:34.687 --> 01:56:38.124
OVERWHELMING THAT 78% INCREASE

01:56:38.191 --> 01:56:41.327
AND NICOTINE USE OVER THE LAST

01:56:41.394 --> 01:56:42.128
TWO YEARS BY CHILDREN CHILDREN

01:56:42.195 --> 01:56:43.863
FOLKS.

01:56:43.930 --> 01:56:45.665
TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN IS WHAT WHAT

01:56:45.732 --> 01:56:47.900
WHAT WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST HERE.

01:56:47.967 --> 01:56:53.072
LET ME JUST SAY -- THE THE IDEA

01:56:53.139 --> 01:56:53.773
THAT.

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:56.509
THE ROYAL -- MEDICAL ASSOCIATION

01:56:56.576 --> 01:56:58.344
OF ENGLAND SUGGESTION THAT THE

01:56:58.411 --> 01:56:59.679
CIGARETTES ARE 95%.

01:56:59.746 --> 01:57:05.118
OF LESS -- HARMFUL THAN REGULAR

01:57:05.184 --> 01:57:07.220
CIGARETTES MANY OF US DISAGREE

01:57:07.286 --> 01:57:08.421
WITH AND THERE'S MANY MANY

01:57:08.488 --> 01:57:09.589
PAPERS WRITTEN ABOUT THAT.

01:57:09.655 --> 01:57:11.290
MANY PAPERS WRITTEN ABOUT THAT

01:57:11.357 --> 01:57:13.126
SO I THINK YOU TWO QUESTIONS ARE

01:57:13.192 --> 01:57:16.195
RIGHT PEOPLE -- WHO START USING

01:57:16.262 --> 01:57:18.865
THE CIGARETTES ARE TRANSITION TO

01:57:18.931 --> 01:57:20.366
TO THE CIGARETTES THE MATURE?

01:57:20.433 --> 01:57:21.401
THE STUDY SHOWED THAT THE

01:57:21.467 --> 01:57:22.201
MAJORITY OF THEM GO BACK TO

01:57:22.268 --> 01:57:24.971
REGULAR CIGARETTES -- IN FACT I

01:57:25.037 --> 01:57:26.139
THINK THE DATA SHOWS PRETTY

01:57:26.205 --> 01:57:28.141
CONCRETE LEAVE THAT WHAT WE

01:57:28.207 --> 01:57:29.709
BASICALLY HAVE FOR TOOL USERS IN

01:57:29.776 --> 01:57:30.943
THE UNITED STATES AND THAT'S THE

01:57:31.010 --> 01:57:35.515
MAJORITY OF WHAT PEOPLE DO --

01:57:35.581 --> 01:57:37.250
AND AND AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT

01:57:37.316 --> 01:57:39.018
HOW I WOULD ANSWER YOUR QUESTION

01:57:39.085 --> 01:57:43.156
THANK YOU IN -- FOLLOW UP

01:57:43.222 --> 01:57:44.056
QUESTION.

01:57:44.123 --> 01:57:46.192
IN YOUR TESTIMONY TALKED ABOUT --

01:57:46.259 --> 01:57:47.960
THE TARGETING OF CERTAIN

01:57:48.027 --> 01:57:49.128
COMMUNITIES IS THIS DONE IN

01:57:49.195 --> 01:57:50.663
TERMS OF ADVERTISING OF PRODUCTS

01:57:50.730 --> 01:57:51.130
IN.

01:57:51.197 --> 01:57:54.400
TARGETED COMMUNITIES.

01:57:54.467 --> 01:57:55.201
I WOULD I WOULD EVEN TAKE IT A

01:57:55.268 --> 01:57:56.102
STEP FURTHE -- THERE'S A WHOLE

01:57:56.169 --> 01:57:58.504
HISTORY OF THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY

01:57:58.571 --> 01:58:00.139
TARGETING OF MINORITY

01:58:00.206 --> 01:58:01.707
COMMUNITIES AND SPECIALLY THE

01:58:01.774 --> 01:58:04.310
BLACK COMMUNITY AND GETTING THEM

01:58:04.377 --> 01:58:06.279
FLAVOR PRODUCTS WHAT'S BEEN MOST

01:58:06.345 --> 01:58:09.215
INTERESTING TO ME ABOUT IS THE

01:58:09.282 --> 01:58:10.883
PIVOT JEWELS TAKEN.

01:58:10.950 --> 01:58:11.484
THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN WHAT IT

01:58:11.551 --> 01:58:12.385
WANTS TO BE A PARTNER WITH THE

01:58:12.452 --> 01:58:13.719
BLACK COMMUNITY AND MEETING WITH

01:58:13.786 --> 01:58:15.421
DIFFERENT PLAY GROUPS AND HOW

01:58:15.488 --> 01:58:16.522
THEY'RE GOING TO HELP SAVE THE

01:58:16.589 --> 01:58:18.324
TOBACCO EPIDEMIC IN THE BLACK

01:58:18.391 --> 01:58:19.525
COMMUNITY.

01:58:19.592 --> 01:58:21.027
AND IT'S THE SAME PLAY BOOK THE

01:58:21.093 --> 01:58:22.929
TOBACCO INDUSTRY IS USED FOR THE

01:58:22.995 --> 01:58:25.932
LAST -- UNFORTUNATELY THE LAST

01:58:25.998 --> 01:58:27.767
SIXTY OR SEVENTY YEARS WITH OUR

01:58:27.834 --> 01:58:28.835
COMMUNITY.

01:58:28.901 --> 01:58:30.703
LOOK THERE ARE STUDIES AND I

01:58:30.770 --> 01:58:31.504
MENTIONED IT AND WE'VE BEEN WE

01:58:31.571 --> 01:58:32.738
SHOULD WE SHOULD ALL BE AWARE OF

01:58:32.805 --> 01:58:33.406
IT.

01:58:33.473 --> 01:58:34.507
THERE ARE MORE PROMOTIONS FOR

01:58:34.574 --> 01:58:37.143
TOBACCO PRODUCTS IN THE AFRICAN

01:58:37.210 --> 01:58:39.178
AMERICAN COMMUNITY THERE ARE

01:58:39.245 --> 01:58:42.381
MORE -- DISCOUNTS.

01:58:42.448 --> 01:58:44.550
AND THE PRODUCTS ARE CHEAPER --

01:58:44.617 --> 01:58:46.452
WE HAVE STUDIES BOTH COMING OUT

01:58:46.519 --> 01:58:48.087
OF MASSACHUSETTS WHO STUDIES

01:58:48.154 --> 01:58:50.456
COMING OUT OF CALIFORNIAN FACTS

01:58:50.523 --> 01:58:52.024
AND IT IS KNOWN FUNDED AT

01:58:52.091 --> 01:58:53.860
STANFORD OF LOOKING AT THIS

01:58:53.926 --> 01:58:54.927
PHENOMENA.

01:58:54.994 --> 01:58:57.497
THE IDEA OF PUTTING UP A COUPON

01:58:57.563 --> 01:58:59.499
FOR JUL IN A MARLBORO CIGARETTE

01:58:59.565 --> 01:59:02.101
IS THE PROOF OF THE TOOL USE AND

01:59:02.168 --> 01:59:02.635
AND AND IN INCREASING THE

01:59:02.702 --> 01:59:08.541
ADDICTION OF PEOPLE IN THE

01:59:08.608 --> 01:59:08.875
UNITED STATES.

01:59:08.941 --> 01:59:11.777
OF WHILE IT MAY BE TRUE THAT

01:59:11.844 --> 01:59:12.912
THAT THE ONLY THREE MEMBERS OF

01:59:12.979 --> 01:59:17.016
THE BOARD OF TOOL CIGARETTES ON

01:59:17.083 --> 01:59:19.552
ON OF THE PHILIP MORRIS ON JUL

01:59:19.619 --> 01:59:20.319
CIGARETTES -- I THINK THE

01:59:20.386 --> 01:59:22.488
PROBLEM IS IS THAT THE MARKETING

01:59:22.555 --> 01:59:24.924
OF THESE PRODUCTS NOW HAS MUCH

01:59:24.991 --> 01:59:26.792
MORE BACKING THEIR OF THEIR

01:59:26.859 --> 01:59:27.960
FIGHT WITH THE FDA GETS MUCH

01:59:28.027 --> 01:59:34.534
MORE DEVELOPED -- I THINK WE WE

01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:35.801
WE HAVE A CHANCE TO I MEAN I

01:59:35.868 --> 01:59:36.936
WOULD SAY THE LAST THING I SAID

01:59:37.003 --> 01:59:38.738
AT THE OPENING OF THE ONE THING

01:59:38.804 --> 01:59:39.972
THAT FOLKS COULD DO IN THE

01:59:40.039 --> 01:59:41.440
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE THAT

01:59:41.507 --> 01:59:42.742
OTHER THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

01:59:42.808 --> 01:59:43.843
IF YOU TAKE FLAVORS OUT OF

01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:44.777
TOBACCO PRODUCTS IT WOULD

01:59:44.844 --> 01:59:47.113
IMPROVE THE PUBLIC HEALTH IN

01:59:47.179 --> 01:59:48.514
CALIFORNIA STRAIGHT UP.

THE DATA THAT SHOWS YOUTH ARE

02:00:28.721 --> 02:00:30.323
ALSO ABLE TO ACQUIRE THESE OVER

02:00:30.389 --> 02:00:32.391
THE INTERNET -- I BELIEVE YOU

02:00:32.458 --> 02:00:34.126
HAVE ANOTHER BILL THAT'S GOING

02:00:34.193 --> 02:00:35.494
TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE THE NEXT

02:00:35.561 --> 02:00:36.562
BILL YES.

02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:39.065
SB THIRTY NINE WHAT WILL ADDRESS

MIGHT I RESPECT ON TO TO WE GIVE

02:00:51.210 --> 02:00:53.112
THOSE YOU COULDN'T ACTUALLY IF

02:00:53.179 --> 02:00:53.913
YOU'RE ASKED THE QUESTION.

02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:56.382
THEN YOU MAY RESPOND SO IT'S UP

02:00:56.449 --> 02:01:01.887
TO THE SENATOR FOR NOW QUESTION

02:01:01.954 --> 02:01:03.789
ANSWER PERIOD CENTER LEYVA.

02:01:03.856 --> 02:01:05.958
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK

02:01:06.025 --> 02:01:06.926
YOU GENTLEMEN -- SENATORS AND

02:01:06.993 --> 02:01:08.127
I'M HAPPY TO BE A CO AUTHOR ON

02:01:08.194 --> 02:01:09.028
BOTH OF YOUR BILLS.

02:01:09.095 --> 02:01:10.262
AND WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

02:01:10.329 --> 02:01:11.764
NICOTINE AND HOW ADDICTIVE IT IS

02:01:11.831 --> 02:01:12.798
SO I JUST LOOKED IT UP ON

02:01:12.865 --> 02:01:13.299
WIKIPEDIA SO WE COULD.

02:01:13.366 --> 02:01:14.967
HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT WIKIPEDIA

02:01:15.034 --> 02:01:15.768
SAYS A NICOTINE IS HIGHLY

02:01:15.835 --> 02:01:17.136
ADDICTIVE IT IS ONE OF THE MOST

02:01:17.203 --> 02:01:18.070
COMMONLY ABUSED.

02:01:18.137 --> 02:01:19.138
DRUGS SO I THINK THAT THAT'S

02:01:19.205 --> 02:01:20.339
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LEAVING OUT

02:01:20.406 --> 02:01:22.174
OF THIS EQUATION NICOTINE IS A

02:01:22.241 --> 02:01:22.608
DRUG.

02:01:22.675 --> 02:01:24.076
IT ALSO SAYS THAT NICOTINE

02:01:24.143 --> 02:01:25.378
INDUCES BOTH BEHAVIORAL

02:01:25.444 --> 02:01:27.513

AND THE REASON WHY I ASK THOSE

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:17.236
QUESTIONS IS BECAUSE THERE ARE --

02:06:17.303 --> 02:06:19.171
IT POLICIES THAT WE AS A

02:06:19.238 --> 02:06:20.706

ALCOHOL THOSE THINGS ARE

02:06:44.296 --> 02:06:45.998
ADDICTIVE AS WELL SO I GUESS MY

02:06:46.065 --> 02:06:46.999
QUESTION IS IS THAT.

02:06:47.066 --> 02:06:49.969

NICOTINE ADDICTION AND TOBACCO

02:07:08.754 --> 02:07:10.990

THIS COMPANY IS NOW OWNED BY A

02:07:12.891 --> 02:07:13.659
TOBACCO COMPANY.

02:07:13.726 --> 02:07:15.494
THEY FAILED TO DO THAT.

02:07:15.561 --> 02:07:16.962
HISTORICALLY.

02:07:17.029 --> 02:07:19.965
WE CONTINUE TO MARKET THE

THAT PRODUCT INTO THE HANDS OF

YOUNG PEOPLE I DON'TSEE I'VE

02:07:23.035 --> 02:07:24.303

02:07:24.370 --> 02:07:25.738
ALCOHOL.

02:07:25.804 --> 02:07:28.574

OF THE CIGARETTES THIS IS AN

02:07:37.649 --> 02:07:39.084
EPIDEMIC THAT REQUIRES THIS

02:07:39.151 --> 02:07:41.286

MANUFACTURERS OF THIS PRODUCT.

02:07:47.960 --> 02:07:49.428

REGULATE THEMSELVES TO MAKE

02:07:52.031 --> 02:07:53.499
THOSE CHANGES AND TO KEEP THAT

02:07:53.565 --> 02:07:56.635

TO REGULATE THAT INDUSTRY TO A

02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:17.122
POINT THAT DOESN'T ALLOW CHILD

02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:18.290
ACCESS.

02:08:18.357 --> 02:08:19.558

ACTUALLY DECLINING.

02:09:18.217 --> 02:09:19.818
SINCE THE LEGALIZATION OF

RECREATIONAL USE OF MARIJUANA IN

02:09:21.620 --> 02:09:23.021

I'M CURIOUS.

02:11:17.769 --> 02:11:20.672
AS A FORMER TOBACCO SMOKER.

02:11:20.739 --> 02:11:22.641
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT IF YOU

SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITION.

02:11:34.419 --> 02:11:37.356
I'M SUGGESTING THAT.

02:11:37.422 --> 02:11:38.490
WHEN THE SMOKERS QUIT

02:11:38.557 --> 02:11:40.325
CONSIDERING QUITTING SMOKING

02:11:40.392 --> 02:11:41.627
ANYTHING THAT?

02:11:41.693 --> 02:11:43.629
REALLY ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH

02:11:43.695 --> 02:11:44.763
TOBACCO CIRCUITS HAVE FOR

02:11:44.830 --> 02:11:46.999
EXAMPLE CIGARS DIP PRODUCTS

02:11:47.065 --> 02:11:50.002
ANYTHING ASSOCIATED WITH TOBACCO --

02:11:50.068 --> 02:11:51.436
ISN'T GOING TO HELP YOU QUIT

02:11:51.503 --> 02:11:53.905
SMOKING CIGARETTES SO THE SECOND

02:11:53.972 --> 02:11:56.475
THAT THIS BECAME A MAJOR

02:11:56.541 --> 02:11:58.977
PHENOMENON THE PEOPLE -- AND YOU

02:11:59.044 --> 02:12:00.345
START HERE OF THE OTHER FLAVOR

02:12:00.412 --> 02:12:03.215
CHOICES.

02:12:03.282 --> 02:12:04.716
IN YOUR MIND YOU CAN.

02:12:04.783 --> 02:12:05.917
IMMEDIATELY START TO ASSOCIATE

02:12:05.984 --> 02:12:06.551
THAT YOU'RE NOT SMOKING TOBACCO

02:12:06.618 --> 02:12:08.120
I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADD IN ON THAT

02:12:08.186 --> 02:12:09.988
POINT THAT NOT ALL NICOTINE IN

02:12:10.055 --> 02:12:12.858
PAY PRODUCTS COMES FROM TOBACCO --

02:12:12.924 --> 02:12:14.626
THERE'S MANY THERE'S OTHER

02:12:14.693 --> 02:12:17.863
SOURCES THAT NICOTINE COMES FROM --

02:12:17.929 --> 02:12:19.665
BUT YES I I I AM STATING THAT IT

02:12:19.731 --> 02:12:22.000
WAS EXTREMELY HELPFUL FOR ME TO

02:12:22.067 --> 02:12:23.468
BE ABLE TO BECAUSE AT THE SAME

02:12:23.535 --> 02:12:25.070
TIME THAT THERE WAS FOR FLAVORS

02:12:25.137 --> 02:12:26.672
THERE WAS ALSO TOBACCO.

02:12:26.738 --> 02:12:27.773
FLAVOR.

02:12:27.839 --> 02:12:28.840
THAT I COULD HAVE CHOSEN FROM

02:12:28.907 --> 02:12:30.642
BUT YOU OPTED NOT TO BECAUSE IN

02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:32.311
YOUR MIND YOU WERE TRANSITIONING

02:12:32.377 --> 02:12:34.479
AWAY FROM SMOKING SO THE FLAVOR

02:12:34.546 --> 02:12:36.715
GAVE YOU THE IMPRESSION THAT YOU

02:12:36.782 --> 02:12:38.283
WERE.

02:12:38.350 --> 02:12:41.453
NOT REALLY SMOKING CORRECT -- IT

02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:42.220
DEFINITELY DID IT DEFINITELY DID

02:12:42.287 --> 02:12:43.388
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT MORE

02:12:43.455 --> 02:12:45.524
RECENTLY WHEN WHEN THE 3%.

02:12:45.590 --> 02:12:46.925
WHEN THE LOWER NICOTINE LEVELS

02:12:46.992 --> 02:12:50.862
CAME OUT THE -- THE THEM THE

02:12:50.929 --> 02:12:51.730
IMMEDIATE ENTRY.

02:12:51.797 --> 02:12:52.798
IMMEDIATE ONES THAT WERE

02:12:52.864 --> 02:12:54.766
AVAILABLE TO ME WE'RE BACK TO

02:12:54.833 --> 02:12:56.668
THE TOBACCO FLAVOR AND SO I

02:12:56.735 --> 02:12:58.403
ACTUALLY BOUGHT THAT AND I CAN

02:12:58.470 --> 02:13:00.505
TELL YOU THAT IT TOUGH MENTALLY.

02:13:00.572 --> 02:13:02.374
DEFINITELY BROUGHT ME BACK TO

02:13:02.441 --> 02:13:04.676
CIGARETTE SMOKING WHICH BY THE

02:13:04.743 --> 02:13:05.877
WAY I FIND DISGUSTING.

02:13:05.944 --> 02:13:07.879
ABSOLUTELY 1100% AND THAT WAS

02:13:07.946 --> 02:13:10.882
VERY HARD AND SO WHEN I HEARD

02:13:10.949 --> 02:13:13.051
THEM TALKING ABOUT -- THEY'LL

02:13:13.118 --> 02:13:14.786
GET THEY'LL GET ANYTHING THAT'S

02:13:14.853 --> 02:13:17.356
NOT TRUE THAT'S REALLY NOT TRUE

02:13:17.422 --> 02:13:17.923
I THINK.

02:13:17.989 --> 02:13:19.257
A LOT OF PAPERS WOULD GO AS FAR

02:13:19.324 --> 02:13:21.293
AS TRYING TO BUY THEIR OWN

02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:22.127
LITTLE FLAVOR.

YOU KNOW AN EDIBLE GRADE LAVORS

02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:26.298

THEIR NICOTINE THIRD THEIR PAPER

02:13:27.466 --> 02:13:29.401
PRODUCTS AT THAT POINT -- IT IS

02:13:29.468 --> 02:13:32.404
VERY MUCH SO BUT THE FLAVORS FOR

02:13:32.471 --> 02:13:34.106
ME PERSONALLY WERE A MAJOR PART

02:13:34.172 --> 02:13:36.341
OF ME BEING ABLE TO DISASSOCIATE

02:13:36.408 --> 02:13:41.279
WITH TOBACCO.

02:13:41.346 --> 02:13:42.814

02:38:50.454 --> 02:38:52.489

NUTRITIONAL VALUE.

02:44:01.298 --> 02:44:03.333
STUDIES SHOW THAT DRINKING JUST

02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:05.402
ONE SUGARY DRINK A DAY INCREASES

02:44:05.468 --> 02:44:07.037

EFFICIENT TO PRODUCE FOR FOR

02:57:07.316 --> 02:57:08.284
OTHER STATES AND SO THE

03:00:00.723 --> 03:00:01.557
BILL.

03:00:01.624 --> 03:00:03.092
AT THE END OF A MEAL IN A FULL

03:00:03.159 --> 03:00:05.127
SERVICE RESTAURANT IS IT ON THE

03:00:05.194 --> 03:00:06.395
RECEIPT.

03:00:06.462 --> 03:00:07.963
IS IT ON THE MENU IS IT ON THE

03:00:08.030 --> 03:00:10.399
MENU BOARD THE LIST GOES ON AND

03:00:10.466 --> 03:00:11.967
IT CREATES A COMPLIANCE

03:00:12.034 --> 03:00:13.636
NIGHTMARE FOR US IT ALSO RAISES

03:00:13.702 --> 03:00:16.138
CONCERNS ABOUT PUTTING POSTINGS.

03:00:16.205 --> 03:00:17.806
EVERYWHERE TO COMPLY WITH THE

03:00:17.873 --> 03:00:19.375
BILL AND THEN YOU HAVE TO ASK

03:00:19.441 --> 03:00:20.876
YOURSELF WHAT IS THE VALUE OF

03:00:20.943 --> 03:00:22.244
THAT ARE YOU DESENSITIZING

03:00:22.311 --> 03:00:24.446
PEOPLE -- IN SIMILAR WAYS THAT

03:00:24.513 --> 03:00:25.514
WE'VE SEEN IN THE PREVIOUS

03:00:25.581 --> 03:00:27.082
GOVERNOR HAD MENTIONED ABOUT

03:00:27.149 --> 03:00:28.651

THOSE WE ALSO POST IN

03:00:32.521 --> 03:00:34.657
DON'T WANT THIS TO BECOME A NEW

03:00:34.723 --> 03:00:36.792
PROP SIXTY FIVE BURDEN FOR US

03:00:36.859 --> 03:00:41.330

SCARY SYMBOL THAT'S INVOLVED IS

03:00:49.738 --> 03:00:51.307
DESCRIPTIVE AND FOR US WE

03:00:51.373 --> 03:00:53.075
BELIEVE THAT THE POINT OF SALE

03:00:53.142 --> 03:00:55.477
SITUATION WOULD REQUIRE US TO

03:00:55.544 --> 03:00:57.413
PUT IT ALL OVER THE PLACE -- FOR

03:00:57.479 --> 03:00:59.281

03:04:25.387 --> 03:04:26.522
CAPITAL.

03:04:26.588 --> 03:04:28.824
ON THIS STRATEGY WHERE WE ARE

03:04:28.891 --> 03:04:30.392
REALLY IGNORING.

BUT ON SUGAR ADDED JUICE.

03:04:59.354 --> 03:05:00.756
THE LABEL IS NOT BASED ON THE

PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES AND WHY

03:06:12.861 --> 03:06:14.997
THE DOCTORS AND THE SCIENTISTS.

03:06:15.063 --> 03:06:17.299

03:06:22.471 --> 03:06:23.372
AN ANSWER TO THAT.

03:06:23.438 --> 03:06:24.339
THERE ARE SUGAR AND OTHER FOOD

03:06:24.406 --> 03:06:27.342
PRODUCTS WE WANT TO REDUCE SUGAR

03:06:27.409 --> 03:06:30.012
INTAKE.

03:06:30.078 --> 03:06:32.347
ONLY A FOOD PRODUCT A DIFFERENT

03:06:32.414 --> 03:06:33.916
PASS WITH PERMISSION OF THE

03:06:33.982 --> 03:06:34.850
CHAIR MISSION OF THE CHAIR TO

03:06:34.917 --> 03:06:37.085

03:06:37.152 --> 03:06:37.920
THANK YOU.

03:06:37.986 --> 03:06:38.520
THIS IS A TWENTY FLUID OUNCE

03:06:38.587 --> 03:06:39.821
BOTTLE.

03:06:39.888 --> 03:06:41.823
AND IT CONTAINS THE EQUIVALENT

03:06:41.890 --> 03:06:44.660
OF SIXTEEN TEASPOONS OF SUGAR.

03:06:44.726 --> 03:06:46.828
SO IT ASK YOU OR THE FOOD

03:06:46.895 --> 03:06:48.230
INDUSTRY OR THE MEDICAL

03:06:48.297 --> 03:06:50.732
PROFESSION. TO FIND ME A FOOD

03:06:50.799 --> 03:06:52.935
PRODUCT THAT PACKS THAT MUCH

03:06:53.001 --> 03:06:54.636
CONCENTRATED SUGAR.

03:06:54.703 --> 03:06:56.371
INTO A PRODUCT WITH NO OTHER

03:06:56.438 --> 03:06:57.573
NUTRITIONAL VALUE.

03:06:57.639 --> 03:06:59.274
IF A CHILD DRINKS TWO OF THESE A

03:06:59.341 --> 03:07:01.209
DAY THEY'RE INCREASING THEIR

03:07:01.276 --> 03:07:04.846
RISK FOR DIABETES ACQUISITION.

03:07:04.913 --> 03:07:06.281
BY 26%.

03:07:06.348 --> 03:07:07.983
SO WE CAN LOOK AT OTHER FOODS

03:07:08.050 --> 03:07:10.352
THEY HAVE SUGAR WE ALSO KNOW

03:07:10.419 --> 03:07:11.520
FROM THE DOCTORS NOT THE

03:07:11.587 --> 03:07:13.622
POLITICIANS.

03:07:13.689 --> 03:07:15.057
THAT THE LIQUID DELIVERY.

03:07:15.123 --> 03:07:16.525
GO STRAIGHT TO THE PANCREAS IN

03:07:16.592 --> 03:07:18.393
THE LIVER CONVERTS THE SUGAR TO

03:07:18.460 --> 03:07:20.295
FAT IN A MANNER THAT FOOD

03:07:20.362 --> 03:07:21.396
PRODUCTS DON'T.

03:07:21.463 --> 03:07:23.532
SO THERE'S A SCIENTIFIC RESPONSE

03:07:23.599 --> 03:07:26.301
NOT A POLITICAL RESPONSE BUT I'M

03:07:26.368 --> 03:07:27.903

SISTERS IN THE TEAMSTERS -- I

03:10:13.168 --> 03:10:14.603

HOW A WARNING LABEL IMPACTS JOBS

03:10:17.439 --> 03:10:18.974
WE'VE SEEN FROM THE BROADER

03:10:19.040 --> 03:10:20.308
PUBLIC HALTH EFFORTS.

03:10:20.375 --> 03:10:22.778
A DIVERSIFICATION OF PRODUCTS

03:10:22.844 --> 03:10:23.979
AND THAT'S WHERE THE LABELS EVEN

03:10:24.045 --> 03:10:26.181
MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THE BIG

03:10:26.248 --> 03:10:27.649
MANUFACTURES.

03:10:27.716 --> 03:10:30.886

03:10:37.759 --> 03:10:39.427
CETERA WHICH WOULD ALSO GET THE

03:10:39.494 --> 03:10:40.729
LABEL [inaudible]

03:10:40.796 --> 03:10:42.864
THE MANUFACTURES.

03:10:42.931 --> 03:10:43.431
THEY'RE STILL SELLING THEIR

03:10:43.498 --> 03:10:45.400
PRODUCTS THEY NEED DRIVERS TO

03:10:45.467 --> 03:10:46.802
DRIVE THOSE TRUCKS TO DELIVER

03:10:46.868 --> 03:10:48.436
THE PRODUCTS NOTHING IN THIS

03:10:48.503 --> 03:10:49.671
BILL TAKES THE PRODUCT OFF THE

03:10:49.738 --> 03:10:50.939
SHELF.

03:10:51.006 --> 03:10:53.375
NOTHING IN THIS BILL HAS ANY

03:10:53.441 --> 03:10:55.477
DIRECT CORRELATION TO REDUCTION

03:10:55.544 --> 03:10:56.645
IN JOBS.

03:10:56.711 --> 03:10:58.113
IF ANYTHING IT'S GOING TO CREATE

03:10:58.180 --> 03:10:59.247
SOME MORE JOBS IN THE

03:10:59.314 --> 03:11:01.349
MANUFACTURING PLANTS AS THEY

03:11:01.416 --> 03:11:03.819
ROTATE THEIR BEVERAGE PRODUCTS

03:11:03.885 --> 03:11:04.786
THROUGH IN.

03:11:04.853 --> 03:11:07.122
IN NOW INCLUDE A LABEL THEY'VE

03:11:07.189 --> 03:11:08.623
ARGUED THAT THAT WOULD BE A

03:11:08.690 --> 03:11:10.959
BURDEN. TO HAVE TO LABEL THE

03:11:11.026 --> 03:11:13.328
PRODUCT -- IF YOU NOTICE IN THE

03:11:13.395 --> 03:11:15.363
HOLIDAYS THEY LABEL THE KANSEN

03:11:15.430 --> 03:11:16.965
THE BOTTLES WITH.

03:11:17.032 --> 03:11:18.133
A LEASE NAVIDAD LABELS AND

03:11:18.200 --> 03:11:19.234
THINGS LIKE THAT THEY THEY

03:11:19.301 --> 03:11:20.735
DIVERSIFY THEIR LABELS BASED ON

03:11:20.802 --> 03:11:23.338
ADVERTISING THEY CAN OF FIX A

03:11:23.405 --> 03:11:27.809
SINGLE LABEL THAT'S PERMANENT.

03:11:27.876 --> 03:11:28.777
WITHOUT LOSING JOBS [inaudible]

MY COLLEAGUE -- SENATOR HOLLY

MITCHELL I THINK FOR ME IT'S A

03:11:37.652 --> 03:11:39.855
BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT --

03:11:39.921 --> 03:11:41.590
LONGEVITY IN TERMS OF HEALTHIER

03:11:41.656 --> 03:11:44.459
LIFESTYLES AND I CAN SAY WITH

03:11:44.526 --> 03:11:45.460
CERTAINTY.

03:11:45.527 --> 03:11:47.095
NOT THAT I SUPPORT NECESSARY THE

03:11:47.162 --> 03:11:48.263
INDUSTRY I ADVISE ACCOUNTS

03:11:48.330 --> 03:11:49.831
MEMBER ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO

03:11:49.898 --> 03:11:50.465
ACTUALLY BEHIND SURREY DRINKS

03:11:50.532 --> 03:11:51.266
FROM.

03:11:51.333 --> 03:11:53.735
FROM VENDING MACHINES BUT THE

03:11:53.802 --> 03:11:55.337
CONVERSATION FOR ME IS.

03:11:55.403 --> 03:11:59.241
EXACTLY LIKE -- HOLLY SAID A

03:11:59.307 --> 03:12:00.475
BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT.

03:12:00.542 --> 03:12:01.943
EVERYTHING ELSE AND I DON'T

03:12:02.010 --> 03:12:03.645
BELIEVE NECESSARY THAT.

03:12:03.712 --> 03:12:06.248
DIABETES IS JUST SOLELY BASED ON

03:12:06.314 --> 03:12:07.816
THIS PODUCT AND JUSTICE AND TO

03:12:07.883 --> 03:12:09.584
PREPARE FOR THIS I ACTUALLY

03:12:09.651 --> 03:12:11.052
WALKED DOWN THE AISLES OF A

03:12:11.119 --> 03:12:12.053
SUPERMARKET.

03:12:12.120 --> 03:12:13.088
AND I WAS TAKING PICTURES OF

03:12:13.154 --> 03:12:15.323
EVERY SINGLE LABEL AND AND I

03:12:15.390 --> 03:12:17.959
THINK OUT THERE IS A SENSE OF

03:12:18.026 --> 03:12:19.427
HOLES FALL TO IT. TO ASSUME THAT

03:12:19.494 --> 03:12:21.129
THIS IN PARTICULAR IS GOING TO

03:12:21.196 --> 03:12:22.631
DETER OUR OUR PARENTS FROM FROM

03:12:22.697 --> 03:12:24.432
NOT PICKING UP THAT ITEM AND I

03:12:24.499 --> 03:12:26.334
SAY THIS BECAUSE AS A VICE

03:12:26.401 --> 03:12:28.536
PRINCIPAL AT A SCHOOL I REMEMBER

03:12:28.603 --> 03:12:30.505
THAT WE BàN SUGARY DRINKS WE

03:12:30.572 --> 03:12:32.908
DON'T HAVE ON CAMPUS BUT YET.

03:12:32.974 --> 03:12:35.010
I CAN STOP KIDS FROM COMING --

03:12:35.076 --> 03:12:36.511
WITH THEIR LUNCH WAS A FMILY

03:12:36.578 --> 03:12:38.546
SIZED BAG OF POTATO CHIPS AND I

03:12:38.613 --> 03:12:39.881
WOULD CONFISCATE THEM AND THEY

03:12:39.948 --> 03:12:41.016
WOULD STILL SHOW UP IN.

03:12:41.082 --> 03:12:42.317
THIS WENT ON FOR MONTHS AND MY

03:12:42.384 --> 03:12:43.985
POINT IS NO MATTER HOW MANY

03:12:44.052 --> 03:12:45.987
TIMES I TOOK COME. TO GET AWAY

03:12:46.054 --> 03:12:48.189
AND DIE AND AGAIN I HAVE NOTHING

03:12:48.256 --> 03:12:50.058
TO DO WITH THE STREET TRAINS.

03:12:50.125 --> 03:12:50.725
THAT WAS THEIR LUNCHEON SO TO ME

03:12:50.792 --> 03:12:51.826
IT'S A BROADER CONVERSATION

03:12:51.893 --> 03:12:53.528
ABOUT EDUCATION AND AND THERE

03:12:53.595 --> 03:12:56.031
HAS TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE TO

03:12:56.097 --> 03:13:00.468
THAT SO WHAT I MEAN I THINK I

03:13:00.535 --> 03:13:02.137
HEARD YOU SAY EARLIER ABOUT TOP.

03:13:02.203 --> 03:13:03.238

LABEL ON ON THIS JUST ONE LABEL

03:13:04.906 --> 03:13:06.041
NOW BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT

03:13:06.107 --> 03:13:06.708
KEEPS COMING AND COMING FOR THE

03:13:06.775 --> 03:13:07.709
WITH THE MENU AND THEN THE

03:13:07.776 --> 03:13:08.143
CALORIES AND THEN.

03:13:08.209 --> 03:13:09.444
SO I WANT TO TAKE A STEP BACK

03:13:09.511 --> 03:13:10.879
AND LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE HOW

03:13:10.946 --> 03:13:13.248
DO WE ADDRESS THE CITY DIABETES.

03:13:13.315 --> 03:13:15.183
IN A BROADER CONVERSATION TO

03:13:15.250 --> 03:13:17.018
INCLUDE EVERYTHING THAT CAUSES

03:13:17.085 --> 03:13:18.620
THE DISEASE SO FOR ME.

03:13:18.687 --> 03:13:20.522
I'M NOT NECESSARY THERE AND THE

03:13:20.588 --> 03:13:22.157
SAFETY OF CHILDREN MATTERS TO ME

03:13:22.223 --> 03:13:23.892
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

03:13:23.959 --> 03:13:25.260
I'VE BEEN A YOU KNOW AN EDUCATOR

03:13:25.327 --> 03:13:26.828
FOR SEVENTEEN YEARS SO THAT'S

03:13:26.895 --> 03:13:28.263
REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME CONCERN

03:13:28.330 --> 03:13:29.464
THE FACT THAT I ALSO COME FROM A

03:13:29.531 --> 03:13:31.099
LOW INCOME FAMILY INNER CITY

03:13:31.166 --> 03:13:31.566
COMMUNITY.

03:13:31.633 --> 03:13:33.501
WHERE ARE YOU KNOW A LOT OF

03:13:33.568 --> 03:13:34.569
CHILDREN DON'T HAVE FOOD TO EAT

03:13:34.636 --> 03:13:35.537
AND?

03:13:35.603 --> 03:13:36.638
AND AGAIN THEY WALK RUN WITH

03:13:36.705 --> 03:13:39.174
SODAS AND POTATO CHIPS I WANT TO

03:13:39.240 --> 03:13:40.809
MAKE SURE THAT IT'S REALLY -- A

03:13:40.875 --> 03:13:42.444
QUALITY DECISION FOR ME IN TERMS

03:13:42.510 --> 03:13:45.113
OF FREE FEELING CONFIDENT THAT

03:13:45.180 --> 03:13:46.581
WERE SOLVING THE PROBLEM.

03:13:46.648 --> 03:13:48.149
AND I'M NOT THERE YET AND I JUST

03:13:48.216 --> 03:13:48.616
YOU KNOW WE HAD THIS

03:13:48.683 --> 03:13:50.518
CONVERSATION I DON'T WANT TO BE

03:13:50.585 --> 03:13:50.919
HONEST WITH YOU.

03:13:50.986 --> 03:13:52.821
BUT I REALLY DO THANK YOU FOR

03:13:52.887 --> 03:13:53.855
FOR TRYING TO DO THIS YEAH AND I

03:13:53.922 --> 03:13:54.889
AND I WILL CONTINUE O HAVE A

03:13:54.956 --> 03:13:56.791
CONVERSATION WITH CAN I LOOK FOR

03:13:56.858 --> 03:13:57.525
TO IT AND I APPRECIATE YOUR

03:13:57.592 --> 03:13:59.928
CANDOR AND IN OUR CONVERSATIONS.

03:13:59.995 --> 03:14:01.796
IF I COULD MISTER CHAIR CREST DR

03:14:01.863 --> 03:14:03.698
CO FOR TO JUST RESPOND TO THE

03:14:03.765 --> 03:14:06.001
PART OF THE QUESTION ABOUT.

03:14:06.067 --> 03:14:06.968
WHY FOCUSING ON SODA AND NOT

03:14:07.035 --> 03:14:08.670
EVERYTHING ELSE?

03:14:08.737 --> 03:14:10.038
YES THANK YOU.

03:14:10.105 --> 03:14:11.506
THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR RUBIO

03:14:11.573 --> 03:14:13.074
WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR

03:14:13.141 --> 03:14:15.043
THOUGHTFULNESS ABOUT THIS ONE OF

03:14:15.110 --> 03:14:16.344
THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE

03:14:16.411 --> 03:14:17.812
DEMONSTRATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN

03:14:17.879 --> 03:14:19.614
IS THAT THIS IS NOT THERE ONE

03:14:19.681 --> 03:14:20.782
SINGLE ANSWER SO YOU'RE

03:14:20.849 --> 03:14:22.183
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT I THINK YOU AND

03:14:22.250 --> 03:14:22.851
SENATOR MITCHELL OR OR HITTING A

03:14:22.917 --> 03:14:23.385
POINT.

03:14:23.451 --> 03:14:25.587
THIS IS PART OF A BROADER RANGE

03:14:25.653 --> 03:14:27.522
OF STRATEGIES TO BE ABLE TO TRY

03:14:27.589 --> 03:14:28.823
TO HELP PEOPLE TO HAVE THE TOOLS

03:14:28.890 --> 03:14:30.658
AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE

03:14:30.725 --> 03:14:32.027
DECISIONS AND THAT'S WHY THAT

03:14:32.093 --> 03:14:33.261
PEDIATRIC STUDY WAS SO IMPORTANT

03:14:33.328 --> 03:14:34.429
WHEN IT CAME OUT.

03:14:34.496 --> 03:14:36.698
BECAUSE IT COMPARED NO LABEL TO

03:14:36.765 --> 03:14:37.465
HAVING TO CLEAR ON CALORIES

03:14:37.532 --> 03:14:38.767
LABEL TO HAVING THE WARNING

03:14:38.833 --> 03:14:40.435
LABEL AND WHAT THEY FOUND WAS

03:14:40.502 --> 03:14:42.103
THAT YES SOME PARENTS STILL

03:14:42.170 --> 03:14:43.238
PURCHASE SUGARY DRINKS THAT'S

03:14:43.304 --> 03:14:44.739
ALWAYS GOING TO HAPPEN THE KIDS

03:14:44.806 --> 03:14:46.808
ARE GOING TO CRAVE SUGAR OUR

03:14:46.875 --> 03:14:47.475
BODIES CRAVE SUGAR SALT AND FAT.

03:14:47.542 --> 03:14:48.877
THAT S OUR BIOLOGICAL REALITY

03:14:48.943 --> 03:14:50.845
BUT THE DIFFERENCE THERE IS THAT

03:14:50.912 --> 03:14:52.480
THE PARENTS AND WERE NO LONGER

03:14:52.547 --> 03:14:54.616
SAYING -- I THOUGHT THAT WAS

03:14:54.682 --> 03:14:55.450
RIGHT LIKE THE BEST EXAMPLE THAT

03:14:55.517 --> 03:14:56.384
I CAN GIVE YOU IS THAT WHEN WE

03:14:56.451 --> 03:14:57.919
SEND OUT OUR FAX SHE IS A

03:14:57.986 --> 03:14:59.354
RESEARCHER AT ONE OF THE YOU SEE

03:14:59.421 --> 03:15:00.688
THAT I WILL NOT NAME WHO DOES

03:15:00.755 --> 03:15:02.157
SUGAR RESEARCH.

03:15:02.223 --> 03:15:03.091
WHO RESPONDED BACK TO ME AND

03:15:03.158 --> 03:15:04.793
SAID YOU KNOW YOU SHOULD INCLUDE

03:15:04.859 --> 03:15:06.361
THE 1100% FRUIT JUICE BECAUSE

03:15:06.428 --> 03:15:07.629
THOSE THERE'S DIFFERENT FINANCE

03:15:07.695 --> 03:15:09.831
ON THAT AND I SAID ACTUALLY

03:15:09.898 --> 03:15:10.498
THAT'S NOT THOUGH I HEAR PERCENT

03:15:10.565 --> 03:15:10.932
FRUIT JUICE?

03:15:10.999 --> 03:15:12.400
THE LABEL IS JUST REALLY

03:15:12.467 --> 03:15:17.305
DECEPTIVE THAT'S WHY WE NEED OF

03:15:17.372 --> 03:15:19.140
WARNING LABEL.

03:15:19.207 --> 03:15:19.941
THIS IS THE PHD WHO STUDY SUGAR

03:15:20.008 --> 03:15:20.909
ON A REGULAR BASIS WHO COULD NOT

03:15:20.975 --> 03:15:22.510
DISTINGUISH OUR THE THE ORANGE

03:15:22.577 --> 03:15:24.646
DRINK JUICE DRINK FROM AN ACTUAL

03:15:24.712 --> 03:15:25.413
1100%.

03:15:25.480 --> 03:15:26.915
ORANGE JUICE PRODUCT THAT'S

03:15:26.981 --> 03:15:28.817
TERRIFYING BECAUSE SHE HAS A PHD

03:15:28.883 --> 03:15:30.418
IN STUDY THIS ON A REGULAR BASIS

03:15:30.485 --> 03:15:31.853
AND AT FIRST GLANCE COULD NOT

03:15:31.920 --> 03:15:33.154
TELL THE DIFFERENCE HOW DO WE

03:15:33.221 --> 03:15:34.656
EXPECT OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO

03:15:34.722 --> 03:15:35.356
WANT TO DO BETTER.

03:15:35.423 --> 03:15:37.158
WHO BEEN DIAGNOSE 46% OF OUR

03:15:37.225 --> 03:15:39.794
POPULATION HAS PRE DIABETES?

03:15:39.861 --> 03:15:41.229
AND HAVE BEEN TOLD BY A DOCTOR

03:15:41.296 --> 03:15:42.564
YOU HAVE A CONDITION THAT

03:15:42.630 --> 03:15:44.265
INCREASES YOUR LIKELIHOOD OF

03:15:44.332 --> 03:15:45.967
HAVING DIABETES IN YOUR LIFE AND

03:15:46.034 --> 03:15:47.302
THEY'RE LIKE OKAY I'M I'M GOING

03:15:47.368 --> 03:15:48.303
TO GET ON TOP OF IT NOW IT'S

03:15:48.369 --> 03:15:49.104
IT'S A LITTLE LATE IF NOT

03:15:49.170 --> 03:15:50.405
PRIMARY PREVENTION BUT I'M GONNA

03:15:50.472 --> 03:15:50.939
GET ON TOP OF IT.

03:15:51.005 --> 03:15:52.373
NOW AND THEN YOU'RE TRYING TO

03:15:52.440 --> 03:15:53.842
FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THAT AND

03:15:53.908 --> 03:15:55.310
YOU CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE

03:15:55.376 --> 03:15:56.911
BETWEEN CERTAIN PRODUCTS IS THAT

03:15:56.978 --> 03:15:57.846
YOU'RE SAYING WILL NOT GOING TO

03:15:57.912 --> 03:16:00.281
CONSUME THE SODAS BUT THIS THIS

03:16:00.348 --> 03:16:01.950
ARMS YOU DRINK THAT'S JUST RIGHT

03:16:02.016 --> 03:16:02.917
ITS FRUIT THAT'S NATURAL.

03:16:02.984 --> 03:16:03.885
AND SO I THINK WITH THE FINANCES

03:16:03.952 --> 03:16:05.220
SHOWING US THAT THIS IS ONE

03:16:05.286 --> 03:16:06.087
STRATEGY AND COULD BE A VERY

03:16:06.154 --> 03:16:07.555
IMPORTANT STRATEGY WHEN PEOPLE

03:16:07.622 --> 03:16:08.723
ARE TRYING TO MANAGE THEIR

03:16:08.790 --> 03:16:10.291
HEALTH AND TRYING TO MAKE BETTER

03:16:10.358 --> 03:16:11.326
DECISIONS AND THE LAST THING WE%

03:16:11.392 --> 03:16:12.327
LIKE TO SEE IS.

03:16:12.393 --> 03:16:14.229
SOMEBODY RYING AND FAILING

03:16:14.295 --> 03:16:14.829
BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE

03:16:14.896 --> 03:16:16.598
INFORMATION OUR HEALTH LITERACY

03:16:16.664 --> 03:16:19.367
IS INCREDIBLY LOW AND SO THAT'S

03:16:19.434 --> 03:16:20.001
PART OF THE REASON WHY THE ICON

03:16:20.068 --> 03:16:21.236
IS THERE SO THAT YOU DON'T EVEN

03:16:21.302 --> 03:16:22.670
HAVE TO KNOW TO READ WE CAN

03:16:22.737 --> 03:16:23.705
STILL MESSAGE THIS AND THERE CAN

03:16:23.771 --> 03:16:25.206
BE A PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGN.

03:16:25.273 --> 03:16:26.708
AROUND WHAT THAT ICON MEANS AND

03:16:26.774 --> 03:16:29.410
WHY BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE REALLY

03:16:29.477 --> 03:16:32.614
ARE UNCLEAR THAT ONE DRINK A DAY

03:16:32.680 --> 03:16:33.581
ONE JUST ONE INCREASES YOUR

03:16:33.648 --> 03:16:40.455
LIKELIHOOD OF DIABETES BY 27%

03:16:40.522 --> 03:16:40.755
[inaudible]

03:16:40.822 --> 03:16:41.923
THAT'S TERRIFYING.

03:16:41.990 --> 03:16:44.325
THANK YOU THANK YOU -- MAKE

03:16:44.392 --> 03:16:46.528
ANOTHER STATEMENT IF I MAY AB

03:16:46.594 --> 03:16:47.996
BRIEFLY AND THEN OF THAT BECAUSE

03:16:48.062 --> 03:16:50.465
WE HAVE OTHER PEOPLE IN LINE SO.

03:16:50.532 --> 03:16:51.933
SERVE CONTINUATION OF YOUR VERY

03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:52.600
BRIEFLY QUICKLY AND AGAIN I

03:16:52.667 --> 03:16:53.935
DON'T DOUBT DISCOUNT ANYTHING

03:16:54.002 --> 03:16:54.836
YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE IT'S VALID

03:16:54.903 --> 03:16:55.803
AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

03:16:55.870 --> 03:16:57.472
BUT I ALSO DID A LITTLE BIT MORE

03:16:57.539 --> 03:16:59.674
TAKING A RESURGENT AND I FOUND

03:16:59.741 --> 03:17:00.475
THAT WITHIN THE SAME PERIOD OF

03:17:00.542 --> 03:17:01.809
TIME.

03:17:01.876 --> 03:17:04.579
I BELIEVE DIABETES INCREASE 30%

03:17:04.646 --> 03:17:06.681
BUT YET TRICKERY CONSUMPTION I'M

03:17:06.748 --> 03:17:07.982
SORRY SIR HE DRINKS CONSUMPTION

03:17:08.049 --> 03:17:09.717
DECREASED ABOUT 10%.

03:17:09.784 --> 03:17:10.952
AND SO THERE'S A DISPARITY

03:17:11.019 --> 03:17:13.488
BETWEEN THE INCREASE IN DIABETES

03:17:13.555 --> 03:17:14.722
AND AND THE USE OF SURGERY

03:17:14.789 --> 03:17:17.158
DURING SO I'M JUST TRYING TO

03:17:17.225 --> 03:17:17.992
MAKE SURE THAT I GOING TO SAY

03:17:18.059 --> 03:17:18.193
YES.

03:17:18.259 --> 03:17:19.194
YEAH ALL INFORMED AND SO I DON'T

03:17:19.260 --> 03:17:20.795
DISCOUNT YOUR STATE AND THERE IS

03:17:20.862 --> 03:17:22.497
ALWAYS GOING TO BE A TIME LAG

03:17:22.564 --> 03:17:23.464
JUST PUTTING ON A MINUTE BUT IN

03:17:23.531 --> 03:17:24.265
YALA JUST BY TRAINING THERE'S

03:17:24.332 --> 03:17:25.366
ALWAYS GOING TO BE A TIME LAG

03:17:25.433 --> 03:17:25.767
BETWEEN.

03:17:25.833 --> 03:17:26.935
THE TIME THAT YOU START

03:17:27.001 --> 03:17:28.436
SOMETHING AND WHEN YOU SEE THE

03:17:28.503 --> 03:17:29.837
FOR THE WHEN YOU SEE THE DECLINE

03:17:29.904 --> 03:17:31.406
ALSO SOMETIMES IT DEPENDS ON HOW

03:17:31.472 --> 03:17:32.774
SUGARY DRINKS OR TO FIND BECAUSE

03:17:32.840 --> 03:17:34.008
WE HAVE SEEN A DECLINE IN THE

03:17:34.075 --> 03:17:35.176
SUGARY DRINKS THAT HAVE BEEN

03:17:35.243 --> 03:17:36.544
REGULATED IN SCHOOLS AND THINGS.

03:17:36.611 --> 03:17:38.112
BUT ONE OF THE CAR ABOUT THAT WE

03:17:38.179 --> 03:17:38.880
INCLUDED WERE THINGS LIKE

03:17:38.947 --> 03:17:40.281
GATORADE IN OTHER SPORTS AND

03:17:40.348 --> 03:17:41.816
ENERGY DRINKS AND THEY HAVE AS

03:17:41.883 --> 03:17:43.117
MUCH OF MORE IF NOT MORE SUGAR

03:17:43.184 --> 03:17:44.052
THAN SOME OF THE PRODUCTS THAT

03:17:44.118 --> 03:17:45.520
WERE BANNED FROM SCHOOLS.

03:17:45.587 --> 03:17:46.921
AND SO WE SAW A MAJOR INCREASE

03:17:46.988 --> 03:17:49.490
ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN TWO TO

03:17:49.557 --> 03:17:50.425
FIVE AND CONSUMING BILLS SO WHEN

03:17:50.491 --> 03:17:51.759
WE SAY SUGARY DRINKS IT'S REALLY

03:17:51.826 --> 03:17:53.761
IMPORTANT WHEN WE START LOOKING

03:17:53.828 --> 03:17:54.562
AT RESEARCH TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:17:54.629 --> 03:17:55.063
WE'VE.

03:17:55.129 --> 03:17:56.631
COMPLETELY INCLUDED THE ENTIRE

03:17:56.698 --> 03:17:58.366
BROAD CATEGORY BECAUSE WE

03:17:58.433 --> 03:17:59.567
SOMETIMES THAN A SHIFT FROM ONE

03:17:59.634 --> 03:18:06.074
TYPE OF SUGARY DRINKS TO ANOTHER

03:18:06.140 --> 03:18:09.510
TYPE OF SUGARY DRINK.

03:18:09.577 --> 03:18:11.713
ALL RIGHT CENTER LEYVA.

03:18:11.779 --> 03:18:13.281
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SENATOR

03:18:13.348 --> 03:18:13.815

03:18:14.882 --> 03:18:15.516
ISSUE I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT YOU

ARE WORKING WITH THE TEAMSTERS

03:18:16.217 --> 03:18:16.751
BECAUSE WE DO KNOW THAT THEY

03:18:16.818 --> 03:18:18.152
REPRESENT A LOT OF THESE FOLKS

03:18:18.219 --> 03:18:19.554
AND THAT THEY ARE GOOD UNION

03:18:19.621 --> 03:18:20.822
JOBS.

03:18:20.888 --> 03:18:22.857
AND I HAVE TO SAY -- FOR SOME MY

03:18:22.924 --> 03:18:24.292
COLLEAGUES THAT ARE NEW HERE I

03:18:24.359 --> 03:18:25.627
DID NOT SUPPORT YOUR BILL THE

03:18:25.693 --> 03:18:28.029
LAST TIME AROUND WHAT CHANGED MY

03:18:28.096 --> 03:18:30.598
MIND WAS WHEN I WAS SHOPPING AT

03:18:30.665 --> 03:18:32.000
MY LOCAL GROCERY STORE.

03:18:32.066 --> 03:18:34.002
AND YOU HAVE THE SODA AISLE AND

03:18:34.068 --> 03:18:35.436
EVERYBODY KIND OF KNOWS IT SO

03:18:35.503 --> 03:18:36.971
DOES A PROBLEM.

03:18:37.038 --> 03:18:38.873
BUT THEN ONE I'LL OVER THE

03:18:38.940 --> 03:18:41.676
ENTIRE FILE ON BOTH SIDES WAS

03:18:41.743 --> 03:18:45.613
VITAMIN WATER WAS GATORADE WAS --

03:18:45.680 --> 03:18:47.882
ICED TEA FLAVORED ICE TEA.

03:18:47.949 --> 03:18:49.584
AND WHEN YOU CHECK ALL OF THOSE

03:18:49.651 --> 03:18:53.321
DRINKS THEY ALL HAVE MORE SUGAR

03:18:53.388 --> 03:18:55.323
SOMETIMES THAN SODA.

03:18:55.390 --> 03:18:56.991
AND IT GOT ME TO THINKING ABOUT

03:18:57.058 --> 03:19:01.129
A BILL WE JUST VOTED ON HERE

03:19:01.195 --> 03:19:02.897
SURE -- A LITTLE WHILE AGO.

03:19:02.964 --> 03:19:03.564
THE INDUSTRY SEEMS AS TOBACCO IS

03:19:03.631 --> 03:19:05.600
MOVING FROM CIGARETTES TO VAPING

03:19:05.667 --> 03:19:07.035
IT SEEMS THAT THE INDUSTRY IS

03:19:07.101 --> 03:19:09.404
MOVING FROM SODA. TO THESE

03:19:09.470 --> 03:19:10.772
DRINKS.

03:19:10.838 --> 03:19:12.807
YES YES THE MOVING TO THESE

03:19:12.874 --> 03:19:14.942
DRINKS THAT WE THINK ARE HEALTHY

03:19:15.009 --> 03:19:16.110
AND ARE GOOD FOR US VITAMIN

03:19:16.177 --> 03:19:17.679
WATERS HORRIBLE WHEN MY GIRLS

03:19:17.745 --> 03:19:18.913
WERE YOUNGER AND WANT TO DRINK

03:19:18.980 --> 03:19:22.483

03:19:22.550 --> 03:19:23.885
HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL.

03:19:23.951 --> 03:19:26.487
I DO AGREE IN EDUCATION WE HAVE

03:19:26.554 --> 03:19:28.156
TO EDUCATE MORE WHEN I WAS

03:19:28.222 --> 03:19:29.757

INSTEAD OF PUTTING ME ON INSULIN

03:19:35.863 --> 03:19:37.031
SAID LET'S SEE WHAT YOU'RE

03:19:37.098 --> 03:19:38.800

WELL WHO KNEW A MINUTE BIG

03:19:43.504 --> 03:19:45.306
FORGIVENESS BECAUSE I WAS ONLY

TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD.

03:19:46.674 --> 03:19:48.176
AND WHO KNEW I WOULD I USED TO

03:19:48.242 --> 03:19:51.312

03:19:52.847 --> 03:19:53.414
I KNOW TERRIBLE RIGHT AND THEN

03:19:53.481 --> 03:19:54.315
WHEN I GOT PREGNANT I WANT TO DO

RIGHT BY THESE LITTLE PEOPLE

03:19:55.383 --> 03:19:57.051
INSIDE ME SO I SWITCHED TO FRUIT

03:19:57.118 --> 03:19:58.720

03:20:01.122 --> 03:20:02.590

03:20:02.657 --> 03:20:04.258
THAT OUT AND SWITCHED TO WATER

03:20:04.325 --> 03:20:05.259
WE WON'T HAVE TO PUT YOU ON

THE ADVERTISER.

03:23:25.960 --> 03:23:27.295
MORE IN ANOTHER CATEGORY OF A

03:23:27.361 --> 03:23:29.864
PRODUCT SAFETY WARNING LABEL ON

03:23:29.931 --> 03:23:31.499
THE PRODUCT THAT THE PERSON'S

ABOUT TO CONSUME.

03:23:33.668 --> 03:23:36.637
WE ALSO DON'T TAKE UP. 20% OF

03:23:36.704 --> 03:23:38.339
THE SPACE WE THINK WARRANT

03:23:38.406 --> 03:23:41.008
DEFENDABLE TERRITORY ON THAT BUT

03:23:41.075 --> 03:23:42.143
I APPRECIATE -- DOCTOR CO FOR ME

03:23:42.209 --> 03:23:43.711
WANT TO ADD TO THAT SHE'S BEEN

03:23:43.778 --> 03:23:44.879
INVOLVED WITH THAT CASE THANKS

03:23:44.946 --> 03:23:46.414
FOR THE CLARIFICATION ABSOLUTELY

03:23:46.480 --> 03:23:47.448
YES THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION

03:23:47.515 --> 03:23:50.284
SO THE THERE WAS A JUDGE ON THE

03:23:50.351 --> 03:23:51.719
JDGE'S OPINION ON IT AND WHAT

03:23:51.786 --> 03:23:53.354
THEY TALKED ABOUT WAS WHETHER OR

03:23:53.421 --> 03:23:53.888
NOT SOME OF THE WORDING.

03:23:53.955 --> 03:23:57.024
IN THEIR BILL -- WOULD PASS BE I

03:23:57.091 --> 03:23:58.359
THINK A CAUGHT PURELY FACTUAL ON

03:23:58.426 --> 03:24:00.328
ON A CONTROVERSIAL TEST AND

03:24:00.394 --> 03:24:01.696
THERE WERE THINGS THAT SHE

03:24:01.762 --> 03:24:02.830
DIFFERENT THAN OURS THE BASE BUT

03:24:02.897 --> 03:24:04.432
USE THE NEAR TERM DIABETES OUR

03:24:04.498 --> 03:24:05.700
LABEL SAYS TYPE TWO DIABETES

03:24:05.766 --> 03:24:06.233
THAT'S ONE OF THE

03:24:06.300 --> 03:24:07.234
RECOMMENDATIONS THE INCLUDED

03:24:07.301 --> 03:24:09.136
BECAUSE WE TALK ABOUT TYPE ONE

03:24:09.203 --> 03:24:09.470
IT'S AN AUTO.

03:24:09.537 --> 03:24:10.905
IMMUNE DISEASE AND IT'S NOT

03:24:10.972 --> 03:24:12.807
CAUSED BY YOU KNOW LIFESTYLE

03:24:12.873 --> 03:24:14.208
FACTORS SO THAT'S THAT'S ONE

03:24:14.275 --> 03:24:15.109
DISTINCTION FROM THEIR BILL IN

03:24:15.176 --> 03:24:16.944
HOURS THE OTHER IS THAT OUR BILL

03:24:17.011 --> 03:24:18.879
SIMILAR TO TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL

03:24:18.946 --> 03:24:19.447
WARNINGS.

03:24:19.513 --> 03:24:21.115
THIS MAY CONTRIBUTE AS OPPOSED

03:24:21.182 --> 03:24:23.417
TO CONTRIBUTE BECAUSE THAT IS

03:24:23.484 --> 03:24:25.620
THAT IS THE REPRESENTATIVE OF

03:24:25.686 --> 03:24:26.954
THE BODY OF EVIDENCE THAT WE

03:24:27.021 --> 03:24:28.689
HAVE SO THOSE ARE TWO OF THE

03:24:28.756 --> 03:24:29.323
THINGS THAT THE JUDGES -- JUST

03:24:29.390 --> 03:24:30.758
SAID COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE THE

03:24:30.825 --> 03:24:31.959
PURELY FACTUAL AND

03:24:32.026 --> 03:24:34.128
NCONTROVERSIAL -- TO COME UP

03:24:34.195 --> 03:24:35.630
AND POSSIBLY BE QUESTIONED AND

03:24:35.696 --> 03:24:38.332
SO THOSE ARE NOT CONSIDERATIONS

03:24:38.399 --> 03:24:40.134
FOR OUR BILL SIMILAR -- TO WITH

03:24:40.201 --> 03:24:41.035
SENATOR MINING SAID IN TERMS OF

03:24:41.102 --> 03:24:42.436
THE SIZE DIFFERENCE AND JUST

03:24:42.503 --> 03:24:43.537
OVERALL WERE UNDER A DIFFERENT

03:24:43.604 --> 03:24:44.739
SET OF RULES BECAUSE THIS

03:24:57.084 --> 03:24:57.685
QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS

03:24:57.752 --> 03:24:59.387

PEOPLE CALIFORNIA FROM -- THE

03:25:09.196 --> 03:25:12.667
NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF OF OF THESE

03:25:12.733 --> 03:25:13.834
BEVERAGES.

03:25:13.901 --> 03:25:14.702
PERHAPS HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU

03:25:14.769 --> 03:25:16.003
DOCTOR I THINK I KNOW WHAT THE

03:25:18.873 --> 03:25:20.841
CORRECT ME ARE PERHAPS YOU CAN

JUST ANSWER IT AND WE'LL SEE

03:25:22.109 --> 03:25:25.513
WHETHER YOU AGREE -- SO.

03:25:25.579 --> 03:25:26.614
WHEN THE BIG CONCERNS OF COURSES

03:25:26.681 --> 03:25:29.450
DIABETES AND -- IN GENERAL OF

03:25:29.517 --> 03:25:31.018
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IS THAT YOU

03:25:31.085 --> 03:25:32.887
KNOW OF BEING OBESE IS A RISK

03:25:32.953 --> 03:25:34.555
FACTOR FOR TYPE TWO DIABETES.

03:25:34.622 --> 03:25:36.023
AND WE WANT TO TRY REDUCE TO BE

03:25:36.090 --> 03:25:37.024
SAYING THAT I APPRECIATE YOUR

03:25:37.091 --> 03:25:37.825
THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION ABOUT WELL

03:25:37.892 --> 03:25:39.393
THERE'S IT'S AT GNATS

03:25:39.460 --> 03:25:40.327
MULTIFACTORIAL.

03:25:40.394 --> 03:25:41.796
ANSWER ANY TYPE TWO DIABETES

03:25:41.862 --> 03:25:44.231
MULTIFACTORIAL BUT I I GUESS

03:25:44.298 --> 03:25:45.733
WHAT I WANT MAYBE YOU CAN EXPECT

03:25:45.800 --> 03:25:47.334
THAT TELL ME WHAT THE RESEARCH

03:25:47.401 --> 03:25:49.704
SHOWS IN TERMS OF TYPE TWO

03:25:49.770 --> 03:25:51.672
DIABETES ITSELF NOW OBESITY IS A

03:25:51.739 --> 03:25:53.908
RISK FACTOR IN ITSELF BUT WHAT

03:25:53.974 --> 03:25:56.010
IS THE UNIQUE ROLE SUGAR

03:25:56.077 --> 03:25:57.878
SWEETENED BEVERAGES PLAY.

03:25:57.945 --> 03:25:58.979
AT THE IN TERMS OF PARTICULARLY

03:25:59.046 --> 03:26:00.748
AROUND DIABETES AND METABOLIC

03:26:00.815 --> 03:26:02.750
SYNDROME -- IS IT IS IT IS IT

03:26:02.817 --> 03:26:04.819
MERELY BECAUSE IT CAUSES OBESITY

03:26:04.885 --> 03:26:06.187
IN THAT FIGURES TYPE TO OR DOES

03:26:06.253 --> 03:26:07.488
IT HAVE A PARTICULARLY.

03:26:07.555 --> 03:26:09.523
AFFECT BEYOND JUST OBESITY IN

03:26:09.590 --> 03:26:11.158
ITSELF YES EVEN WHEN THEY CRUISE

03:26:11.225 --> 03:26:12.693
CONTROL -- FOR OBESITY THERE

03:26:12.760 --> 03:26:15.129
STILL IS AN INDEPENDENT IMPACT

03:26:15.196 --> 03:26:16.597
AND THEN IT THE PART -- THOUGHT

03:26:16.664 --> 03:26:18.532
TO BE BECAUSE OF THE WAY IN

03:26:18.599 --> 03:26:20.000
WHICH THE SUGARY DRINKS ARE

03:26:20.067 --> 03:26:21.602
ABSORBED IN THEIR ABSORB MUCH

03:26:21.669 --> 03:26:23.137
FASTER THAN CONSUMING THE

03:26:23.204 --> 03:26:24.605
CONSUMING THE SUGAR AND FOOD.

03:26:24.672 --> 03:26:26.340
BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS

03:26:26.407 --> 03:26:27.675
THAT WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY DONE

03:26:27.742 --> 03:26:29.376
CLINICAL RESEARCH LOOKING AT

03:26:29.443 --> 03:26:31.078
SUGAR IN FOOD AND COMPARING IT

03:26:31.145 --> 03:26:32.646
TO LIQUID SUGAR WE FOCUS A LOT

03:26:32.713 --> 03:26:34.048
OF OUR ATTENTION AND SO WHEN

03:26:34.115 --> 03:26:35.416
WHEN THE QUESTION COMES UP OF

03:26:35.483 --> 03:26:36.484
SHOULD BE BE YOU TO LABELING

03:26:36.550 --> 03:26:37.651
OTHER PRODUCTS AND OTHER.

03:26:37.718 --> 03:26:39.286
THINGS LIKE THAT YOU KNOW AS A

03:26:39.353 --> 03:26:40.654
SCIENCE BASED ORGANIZATION OUR

03:26:40.721 --> 03:26:41.589
ANSWER WOULD BE.

03:26:41.655 --> 03:26:43.090
MAYBE IN THE FUTURE ONCE WE

03:26:43.157 --> 03:26:44.792
STUDY IT BUT WE WOULDN'T WANT TO

03:26:44.859 --> 03:26:45.693
DO SOMETHING THAT WE DON'T THE

03:26:45.760 --> 03:26:47.361
FINANCE TO BACK UP AND RIGHT NOW

03:26:47.428 --> 03:26:48.028
WE HAVE THE SCIENCE TO BACK THIS

03:26:48.095 --> 03:26:50.397
UP -- AND SO THAT'S WHY YOU

03:26:50.464 --> 03:26:51.398
START THERE I WOULD I WOULD

03:26:51.465 --> 03:26:52.299
NEVER WANT TO LABEL IT FOR A

03:26:52.366 --> 03:26:53.734
PRODUCT RIGHT LIKE I COULD I

03:26:53.801 --> 03:26:54.335
WOULD HAVE TO COME UP HERE TO

03:26:54.401 --> 03:26:55.569
POST MY OWN BILL IF WE WERE

03:26:55.636 --> 03:26:56.937
STARTING THE LABEL OTHER THINGS.

03:26:57.004 --> 03:26:58.038
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA

03:26:58.105 --> 03:26:59.373
TO REALLY SHOW THAT HAS THE SAME

03:26:59.440 --> 03:27:00.775
IMPACT WE HAVE SOME THEORIES AND

03:27:00.841 --> 03:27:02.243
SOME INFERENCES WE DON'T HAVE

03:27:02.309 --> 03:27:03.577
THOSE DATA BUT THE SUGAR THE

03:27:03.644 --> 03:27:05.679
SUGARY DRINKS WE SEE INDEPENDENT

03:27:05.746 --> 03:27:06.814
OF THE OBESITY.

03:27:06.881 --> 03:27:08.616
BBC AS AN ADDITIVE FACTOR -- AND

03:27:08.682 --> 03:27:10.484
SO IT'S MOUNT MULTI FACTOR ON

03:27:10.551 --> 03:27:11.685
THAT WAY AND IT THANK YOU THANK

03:27:11.752 --> 03:27:12.953
YOU FOR MAKING THAT POINT

03:27:13.020 --> 03:27:14.955
BECAUSE THAT'S CERTAINLY WHAT I

03:27:15.022 --> 03:27:16.323
ALSO HEAR PHONE I'VE TALKED TO

03:27:16.390 --> 03:27:17.892
IS A PEDIATRICIAN TALKING SO MY

03:27:17.958 --> 03:27:19.026
COLLEAGUES WHO ARE.

03:27:19.093 --> 03:27:20.561
PH AGAIN COLLEGES WHO ARE

03:27:20.628 --> 03:27:21.595
STUDYING THIS ISSUE SO I

03:27:21.662 --> 03:27:31.238
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND AND

03:27:31.305 --> 03:27:33.908
APPRECIATE -- PEOPLE TO ABOUT

03:27:33.974 --> 03:27:34.975
WELLS SUGARS THE PROBLEM SHOULD

03:27:35.042 --> 03:27:35.709
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

03:27:35.776 --> 03:27:36.143
THINGS THAT'S TRUE.

03:27:36.210 --> 03:27:37.511
SUGAR GETS ADDED TO A LOT OF

03:27:37.578 --> 03:27:40.247
DIFFERENT THINGS -- BUT SUGAR

03:27:40.314 --> 03:27:41.015
THAT'S BEING CONSUMED IN LIQUID

03:27:41.081 --> 03:27:42.650
FORM.

03:27:42.716 --> 03:27:44.451
HAS AN EFFECT BEYOND SIMPLY JUST

03:27:44.518 --> 03:27:45.719
THE WHAT'S MORE CALORIES AND NOW

03:27:45.786 --> 03:27:47.354
PEOPLE ARE GETTING.

03:27:47.421 --> 03:27:48.422
HAVE YOU HEARD TO GETTING MORE

03:27:48.489 --> 03:27:49.623
OF THESE AND THAT'S WHAT'S

03:27:49.690 --> 03:27:50.457
TRIGGERING IT THERE'S AN AN

03:27:50.524 --> 03:27:52.026
ADDITIONAL FACT RELATED.

03:27:52.092 --> 03:27:53.861
TO HOW FAST AND HOW HOW QUICKLY

03:27:53.928 --> 03:27:55.095
IT STIMULATES THE CANCELING

03:27:55.162 --> 03:27:56.397
SYSTEM THAT THE REACTION I DON'T

03:27:56.463 --> 03:27:58.432
GET TO TECHNICAL HERE BUT ANY

03:27:58.499 --> 03:28:01.101
ANYTHING. TO ME THAT IS WHY --

03:28:01.168 --> 03:28:03.771
THIS PARTICULAR BILL AND THIS

03:28:03.838 --> 03:28:05.539
PARTICULAR APPROACH IS SOMETHING

03:28:05.606 --> 03:28:06.740
WE SHOULD DEFINITELY BE

03:28:06.807 --> 03:28:08.776
CONSIDERING AND I APPRECIATE --

03:28:08.843 --> 03:28:09.643
CEREMONY YOU YOU YOU POINT OUT

03:28:09.710 --> 03:28:10.945
THAT JUST CAME OUT -- THE JOINT

03:28:11.011 --> 03:28:12.379
STATEMENT FROM AMERICAN CAT

03:28:12.446 --> 03:28:13.514
PEDIATRICS AND AMERICAN HEART

03:28:13.581 --> 03:28:16.283
ASSOCIATION -- WHICH A REVIEW

03:28:16.350 --> 03:28:17.985
THE RESEARCH AND AND AND AND I

03:28:18.052 --> 03:28:19.587
THINK THAT -- CERTAINLY YES IT

03:28:19.653 --> 03:28:21.155
IS WE NEED TO DO OTHER THINGS WE

03:28:21.222 --> 03:28:22.289
NEED TO LOOK AT BUILT

03:28:22.356 --> 03:28:23.657
ENVIRONMENTS WE NEED TO DO

03:28:23.724 --> 03:28:26.794
EXERCISE -- YOU KNOW WE NEED TO

03:28:26.861 --> 03:28:29.597
LOOK OVER OVERALL CALORIC INTAKE --

03:28:29.663 --> 03:28:31.098
WHICH THEN CAN TRIGGER OF THE

03:28:31.165 --> 03:28:34.835
CITY -- SO BUT I THINK WE CAN'T.

03:28:34.902 --> 03:28:37.638
IGNORE THE PARTICULAR ROLE OF

03:28:37.705 --> 03:28:39.206
CONSUMPTION OF SUGAR IN THIS

03:28:39.273 --> 03:28:40.741
PARTICULAR FORM I WOULD POINT

03:28:40.808 --> 03:28:42.943
OUT THAT DAY -- THAT -- I

03:28:43.010 --> 03:28:48.616
BELIEVE IF YOU DRINK ONE CAN OF

03:28:48.682 --> 03:28:49.750
ONE STANDARD CAN OF SODA OR SOME

03:28:49.817 --> 03:28:52.019
EQUIVALENT OF THAT EACH DAY --

03:28:52.086 --> 03:28:53.087
THAT.

03:28:53.153 --> 03:28:54.755
IS EQUAL TO GAINING FIVE POUNDS

03:28:54.822 --> 03:28:56.190
IF YOU DO THIS EVERY DAY FOR A

03:28:56.257 --> 03:28:57.658
YEAR THAT'S FIVE POUNDS OF THINK

03:28:57.725 --> 03:28:59.727
ABOUT TEENAGER HOODS DOING

03:28:59.793 --> 03:29:01.795
DRINKING ONE CAN OF SODA.

03:29:01.862 --> 03:29:06.333
BETWEEN AGE THIRTEEN TWO H..

03:29:06.400 --> 03:29:07.601
EIGHTEEN RIGHT AND THEN AND THEN

03:29:07.668 --> 03:29:08.535
THE YOU CAN ACTUALLY ACTUALLY

03:29:08.602 --> 03:29:10.004
STOP AT AGE EIGHTEEN RIGHT SO

03:29:10.070 --> 03:29:12.106
THAT'S FIVE POUNDS EXTERNAL

03:29:12.172 --> 03:29:13.140
MAYBE THEY COULD EXERCISE THAT

03:29:13.207 --> 03:29:15.476
OFF BUT YOU JUST ADD THAT IN THE

03:29:15.542 --> 03:29:16.877
MEASURE THEY DRINK TOO NOW IT'S

03:29:16.944 --> 03:29:18.178
TEN POUNDS A YEAR RIGHT.

03:29:18.245 --> 03:29:19.647
SO THAT'S FIFTY EXTRA POUNDS

03:29:19.713 --> 03:29:20.648
SOMEONE WOULD HAVE GAINED THAT

03:29:20.714 --> 03:29:22.616
THEY COULD HAVE AVOIDED BUT THEN

03:29:22.683 --> 03:29:23.684
A SCAN IS THE APPOINTED AS YOU

03:29:23.751 --> 03:29:25.119
POINTED OUT IT'S BEYOND JUST

03:29:25.185 --> 03:29:26.620
SIMPLY THE ADDITION OF THE

03:29:26.687 --> 03:29:27.554
WEIGHT ITSELF.

03:29:27.621 --> 03:29:29.757
SO -- SO I THINK YOU KNOW

03:29:29.823 --> 03:29:32.526
CERTAINLY -- WE WANT TO BE SURE

03:29:32.593 --> 03:29:34.194
PEOPLE HAVE THE INFORMATION SO

03:29:34.261 --> 03:29:35.796
PARENTS CAN MAKE THE CHOICES --

03:29:35.863 --> 03:29:38.165
AYE YE I ALSO THINK A AND I I

03:29:38.232 --> 03:29:43.370
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN ABOUT --

03:29:43.437 --> 03:29:44.805
THAT PEOPLE HAVE WELL WHAT

03:29:44.872 --> 03:29:45.439
HAPPENS IF PEOPLE STOP DRINKING

03:29:45.506 --> 03:29:46.106
NAME WELL MY GUESS IS PEOPLE ARE

03:29:46.173 --> 03:29:47.374
STILL THIRSTY AND ARE STILL

03:29:47.441 --> 03:29:48.676
LOOKING.

03:29:48.742 --> 03:29:49.843
FOR DRINKS THAT THEY WANT TO

03:29:49.910 --> 03:29:51.245
DRINK -- ACTUALLY THE FORMER

03:29:51.312 --> 03:29:54.014
PRESIDENT OF COCA COLA SAID THAT

03:29:54.081 --> 03:29:55.983
HIS BIGGEST COMPETITIONS ATER --

03:29:56.050 --> 03:29:57.084
YOU RECKON AND EFFECTIVE MOVED

03:29:57.151 --> 03:29:58.652
INTO THE WATER SPACE THEN THEY

03:29:58.719 --> 03:30:00.220
MOVED IN TREAT I THINK I'VE SEEN

03:30:00.287 --> 03:30:01.288
AS A COUPLE CALL A BRAND.

03:30:01.355 --> 03:30:02.990
SO -- AND I'M NOT ADVERTISING OR

03:30:03.057 --> 03:30:04.925
ANYBODY HERE -- BUT I I THINK

03:30:04.992 --> 03:30:06.560
THAT CERTAINLY WE WANT TO HELP

03:30:06.627 --> 03:30:08.829
THE BEVERAGE INDUSTRY TO

03:30:08.896 --> 03:30:12.466
ACTUALLY -- BE ABLE TO TO TO

03:30:12.533 --> 03:30:13.934
MAKE SALES ONE TO SELL THINGS

03:30:14.001 --> 03:30:15.769
THAT PEOPLE CAN DRINK BUT WE

03:30:15.836 --> 03:30:17.705
ALSO WANT TO BE SURE.

03:30:17.771 --> 03:30:19.406
THAT -- HOPEFULLY AND I AN

03:30:19.473 --> 03:30:20.207
INCIDENT THE INDUSTRY HOPEFULLY

03:30:20.274 --> 03:30:21.308
IS ALSO THINKING ABOUT WHAT CAN

03:30:21.375 --> 03:30:23.077
WE DIRECT PEOPLE TOWARD THAT IS

03:30:23.143 --> 03:30:24.178
GOING TO BE HEALTHIER.

03:30:24.244 --> 03:30:25.512
AND WE SHOULD CERTAINLY INFORM

03:30:25.579 --> 03:30:31.285
CONSUMERS ABOUT THAT -- SO --

03:30:31.352 --> 03:30:31.885
THAT IF THERE'S NO OTHER

03:30:31.952 --> 03:30:34.121
QUESTIONS IS OUR MOTION ON THE

03:30:34.188 --> 03:30:35.956
BILL AND THE PERSON TO FILL

03:30:36.023 --> 03:30:37.524
CENTER MONEY WHICH LIKE THE

03:30:37.591 --> 03:30:37.791
CLOTHES.

03:30:37.858 --> 03:30:38.092
WELL.

03:30:38.158 --> 03:30:38.959
MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I JUST

INFORMED AND RESPECTFUL

03:30:44.398 --> 03:30:45.332
