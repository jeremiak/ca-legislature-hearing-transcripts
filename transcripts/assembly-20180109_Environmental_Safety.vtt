00:44:21.225 --> 00:44:25.129 region:rollup2
HELP THEM IN SO. I'M TRYING TO

00:44:23.394 --> 00:44:26.297 region:rollup2
ASK FROM YOU DO YOU ANTICIPATE

00:44:25.129 --> 00:44:28.166 region:rollup2

.

00:44:31.669 --> 00:44:34.839 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE QUESTION UP BUT THE

00:44:33.738 --> 00:44:36.941 region:rollup2
STATEMENT I NEED TO MAKE IS

00:44:34.839 --> 00:44:39.377 region:rollup2
TODAY I AM MOST LIKELY NOT GOING

00:44:36.941 --> 00:44:40.678 region:rollup2

00:44:39.377 --> 00:44:42.780 region:rollup2

PLAY WITH NUMBERS YOU CAN ALSO

00:44:48.019 --> 00:44:50.221 region:rollup2
SAY THAT GOING FROM ONE THOUSAND

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.290 region:rollup2
FIVE THOUSAND WAS A FOUR

00:44:50.221 --> 00:44:53.824 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLAR INCREASE.

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:54.892 region:rollup2
SO WHY WE INCREASING ANOTHER

00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:56.594 region:rollup2
FOUR THOUSAND TO GET US CLOSER

00:44:54.892 --> 00:44:58.129 region:rollup2
TO THE TEN THOUSAND NUMBER THAT

00:44:56.594 --> 00:45:02.233 region:rollup2
WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER.

00:44:58.129 --> 00:45:03.501 region:rollup2
SO AYE WANT. ASK AND I'M HOPING

00:45:02.233 --> 00:45:05.236 region:rollup2

WE FIND A WAY WITH THAT FINE.

00:45:16.614 --> 00:45:19.884 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR LOCAL

00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:22.153 region:rollup2

SO. IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS

00:47:19.236 --> 00:47:22.206 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION STATES THAT THERE

00:47:20.571 --> 00:47:23.574 region:rollup2
WERE FOUR CASES AND TWENTY

00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:25.376 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN AND ONE CASE AND TWENTY

00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:27.478 region:rollup2
SEVENTY.

00:47:25.376 --> 00:47:29.113 region:rollup2
IS THIS BILL MEANT TO FIX THE

00:47:27.478 --> 00:47:31.749 region:rollup2
ONE CASE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN

00:47:29.113 --> 00:47:34.919 region:rollup2

.

00:47:37.388 --> 00:47:40.291 region:rollup2
I THINK TWENTY SIXTEEN AND

00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:42.793 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN THAT WERE MENTIONED

00:47:40.291 --> 00:47:43.961 region:rollup2
AYE I LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT. WE

00:47:42.793 --> 00:47:45.629 region:rollup2
HAVE A STATUE OF LIMITATIONS OF

00:47:43.961 --> 00:47:46.597 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS AND THE FOR THOSE

00:47:45.629 --> 00:47:48.099 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATIONS THAT THEY'RE

00:47:46.597 --> 00:47:49.934 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY STILL ONGOING

00:47:48.099 --> 00:47:51.369 region:rollup2
IMPENDING. THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A

00:47:49.934 --> 00:47:53.003 region:rollup2
LOWER NUMBER OF THAT A MORE

00:47:51.369 --> 00:47:54.805 region:rollup2
ACCURATE NUMBER MAYBE FROM

00:47:53.003 --> 00:47:56.807 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY FOURTEEN

AND TWENTY SIX.

00:47:57.808 --> 00:48:01.212 region:rollup2
CASES

00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:02.847 region:rollup2
SO THE REASON WHY THERE'S A LOW

00:48:01.212 --> 00:48:03.447 region:rollup2
NUMBER ON THE OTHER ONES IS

00:48:02.847 --> 00:48:10.388 region:rollup2
THOSE THOSE INVESTIGATIONS ARE

00:48:03.447 --> 00:48:11.389 region:rollup2
STILL PENDING.
