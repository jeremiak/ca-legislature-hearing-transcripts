EACH AND EVERYONE OF US THE

IMPORTANCE OF JUNE EIGHTEENTH

00:42:56.006 --> 00:42:59.043
NOT FOR THE JULY BUT JUNETEENTH.

00:42:59.109 --> 00:43:01.278
AND IF YOU KNOW YOUR HISTORY

00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:02.880
THERE ARE THREE THINGS

00:43:02.947 --> 00:43:04.481
ASSOCIATED WITH JUNETEENTH.

00:43:04.548 --> 00:43:08.652
WATERMELON RED SODA POP IN RED

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:11.755
VELVET CAKE. AND THEIR RACIAL

00:43:11.822 --> 00:43:13.691
STEREOTYPES AFTER AMERICANS

00:43:13.757 --> 00:43:15.726
LIKE WATER NO MORE NO WE DON'T

00:43:15.793 --> 00:43:18.062
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IT WAS

00:43:18.128 --> 00:43:20.164
BECAUSE OF JUNETEENTH. AND THE

00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:23.067
RED REPRESENTED THE BLOOD THAT

00:43:23.133 --> 00:43:25.102
WE SHE ADDED FOR THIS COUNTRY

00:43:25.169 --> 00:43:27.037
AS SLAVES AS PEOPLE IN THE

00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:29.873
MILITARY AND IT SIGNIFIES THE

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.309
BLOOD THAT WE LOST AND THAT'S

00:43:32.376 --> 00:43:34.678
WHY IT WAS RED SODA OP THAT'S

00:43:34.745 --> 00:43:37.214
WHY WITH WATERMELON AND THAT'S

00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:40.584
WHY WITH RED VELVET CAKE. THE

00:43:40.651 --> 00:43:41.151
RECOGNIZE THE BLOOD THAT WE

00:43:41.218 --> 00:43:43.354
SHED. IT TOOK ALMOST TWO

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.023
HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OF BONDAGE.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:49.760
STARTING IN NINETEEN I MEAN

00:43:49.827 --> 00:43:50.394
SIXTEEN NINETEEN FOR AMERICA TO

00:43:50.461 --> 00:43:54.231
FINALLY ABOLISHED SLAVERY. IT

00:43:54.298 --> 00:43:56.166
WAS A HUNDRED FIFTY SIX YEARS

00:43:56.233 --> 00:43:58.602
LATER THAT WE HAVE BEEN

00:43:58.669 --> 00:44:01.005
CELEBRATING JUNETEENTH AS THE

00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:03.807
ENDING OF SLAVERY. AND AS WE

00:44:03.874 --> 00:44:07.044
CELEBRATE NOT ONLY. IN TEXAS

00:44:07.111 --> 00:44:08.545
BUT IT WAS ALSO IN LOUISIANA

00:44:08.612 --> 00:44:10.781
THEY GOT THE WORD LATE TOO AS

00:44:10.848 --> 00:44:12.983
THEY MIGRATED WEST TO DO TO

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:15.152
BRING THE MESSAGE BUT THE

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:17.121
BONDAGE IN REMNANTS OF SLAVERY

00:44:17.187 --> 00:44:18.422
STILL EXISTS TODAY IN THIS

00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:20.157
COUNTRY AND AS MY COLLEAGUE

ELOQUENTLY STATED. ALL THOSE

00:44:24.762 --> 00:44:26.697
THINGS THAT WE SUFFER FROM THE

00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:28.732
MOST THE HEALTH DISPARITIES THE

00:44:28.799 --> 00:44:30.267

00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:33.871
EDUCATION. THE HOMELESSNESS.

00:44:33.937 --> 00:44:36.974
THAT MASS INCARCERATION THE

00:44:37.041 --> 00:44:39.410
CALL CENTER ON RACE WE SHOULD

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:40.544
ASK OURSELVES IF WE'RE REALLY

00:44:40.611 --> 00:44:42.880
CONCERNED ABOUT SOLVING THE

00:44:42.946 --> 00:44:43.814
HOMELESSNESS ISSUE WE SHOULD

00:44:43.881 --> 00:44:46.483
ASK THE QUESTION HOW CAN 13% OF

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:49.787
THE POPULATION REPRESENT 50% OF

00:44:49.853 --> 00:44:51.889
HOMELESSNESS THE RACE IS NOT AT

00:44:51.955 --> 00:44:53.924
THE CORE OF EVERYTHING THAT WE

00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:56.794

IMPACT PEOPLE OF COLOR IT

00:45:00.664 --> 00:45:02.132
RAISES NOT THE PART OF

00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:03.534
EVERYTHING THAT WE DO SO WE'RE

00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.135
