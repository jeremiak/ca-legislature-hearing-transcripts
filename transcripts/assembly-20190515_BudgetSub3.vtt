WRITTEN TO REDUCTION OF DRIVING

00:35:28.659 --> 00:35:29.961
REDUCTION VMT THROUGH PROJECTS

00:35:30.027 --> 00:35:30.761
THAT INCORPORATE MOBILITY

00:35:30.828 --> 00:35:32.463
OPTIONS INCLUDING WALKING BIKING

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.232
TRANSIT BUT ALSO A FOCUS ON

00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:35.833
AGAIN GREEN SPACES AND COMMUNITY

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.869
ENGAGEMENT ON THE PROJECTS WHICH

00:35:37.935 --> 00:35:41.672
IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES

00:35:41.739 --> 00:35:41.839
IT.

00:35:41.906 --> 00:35:43.307
UNIQUE -- THE BUDGET ALSO

00:35:43.374 --> 00:35:44.942
INCLUDES -- AYE AYE STRONG FOCUS

00:35:45.009 --> 00:35:45.610
ON DECREASING POLLUTION AND THIS

00:35:45.676 --> 00:35:48.045
IS PARTICULARLY FROM I TRY AGAIN

00:35:48.112 --> 00:35:49.280
THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WHERE

00:35:49.347 --> 00:35:50.748
WE NEED TO MAKE REAL GAINS BUT

00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:53.551
ALSO IN INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE.

00:35:53.618 --> 00:35:55.786
THE BUDGET FOCUSES ON POLLUTION

00:35:55.853 --> 00:35:57.922
DIESEL POLLUTION REDUCTION IN

00:35:57.989 --> 00:35:58.856
THREE PLACES.

00:35:58.923 --> 00:36:01.125
A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE

00:36:01.192 --> 00:36:02.126
FOR CLEAN TRUCKS AND BUSES IN

00:36:02.193 --> 00:36:05.830
OFF ROAD VEHICLE TRANSFORMATION

00:36:05.897 --> 00:36:06.464
FIFTEEN MILLION INCREASE FOR THE

00:36:06.531 --> 00:36:07.899
ENHANCED WITH THE FOREHAND SO

00:36:07.965 --> 00:36:08.933
ENHANCE FLEET MODERNIZATION

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:09.767
PROGRAM SKEWS ME.

00:36:09.834 --> 00:36:11.168
AND SIXTY FIVE MILLION INCREASE

00:36:11.235 --> 00:36:12.136
FOR ENGINE UPGRADES A

00:36:12.203 --> 00:36:13.170
REPLACEMENT FOR AGRICULTURAL

00:36:13.237 --> 00:36:15.172
VEHICLES LL OF THESE PROGRAMS

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:16.240
REALLY GO STRAIGHT TO THE

00:36:16.307 --> 00:36:17.441
QUESTION OF HOW DOES THIS HOW

00:36:17.508 --> 00:36:18.910
DOES POLLUTION FROM THE SECTORS

00:36:18.976 --> 00:36:20.511
WHERE WE ARE NOT MAKING AS AS

00:36:20.578 --> 00:36:21.512
QUICK GAINES.

00:36:21.579 --> 00:36:22.914
AFFECT PEOPLE WHERE THEY LIVE I

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:24.415
WANTED TO SAY A WORD ABOUT THE

00:36:24.482 --> 00:36:25.283
ENHANCE WE ENHANCE FLEET

00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:26.617
MODERNIZATION PROGRAM.

00:36:26.684 --> 00:36:28.052
THERE'S BEEN AS YOU ALL KNOW AND

00:36:28.119 --> 00:36:29.253
CONTINUES TO BE A STRONG FOCUS

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:32.123
AND STILL IS A FOCUS IN THE

00:36:32.189 --> 00:36:34.225
BUDGET ON ON ZERO EMISSION

00:36:34.292 --> 00:36:34.492
VEHICLES.

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:36.027
AND IT'S OF COURSE A HUGE

00:36:36.093 --> 00:36:37.261
PRIORITY FOR THE STATE IN FRONT

00:36:37.328 --> 00:36:37.828
ENHANCE FLEET MODERNIZATION

00:36:37.895 --> 00:36:39.497
PROGRAM I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT.

00:36:39.564 --> 00:36:40.965
STEP STONE TOWARD THAT IT'S A

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:42.333
PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS PARTICULARLY

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.635
ALLOWS PEOPLE TO RETIRE AND

00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:47.171
REPLACE VEHICLES CALIFORNIA'S

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:48.105
TWENTY SIX MILLION LIKE TO THE

00:36:48.172 --> 00:36:50.274
VEHICLES ON THE ROAD TO AT LEAST

00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:50.875
TWO MILLION OF THOSE ARE OVER

00:36:50.942 --> 00:36:52.176
TWENTY YEARS OLD.

00:36:52.243 --> 00:36:53.311
THAT'S A HUGE CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR

00:36:53.377 --> 00:36:54.779
SMOG PROBLEM AND MOST OF THOSE

00:36:54.845 --> 00:36:55.680
ARE IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES

00:36:55.746 --> 00:36:56.981
AND RURAL COMMUNITIES.

00:36:57.048 --> 00:36:59.450
THIS PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY ALLOWS

00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:01.285
AND HELPS PEOPLE REPLACE THOSE

00:37:01.352 --> 00:37:03.054
OLDER VEHICLES WITH NEWER AND

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.589
IDEALLY THERE'S A KICKER FOR

00:37:04.655 --> 00:37:06.257
ELECTRIC VEHICLE SO I THINK IT'S

00:37:06.324 --> 00:37:08.559
A PARTICULAR IMPORTANT PROGRAM --

00:37:08.626 --> 00:37:10.261
WE THINK TO SUPPORT.

00:37:10.328 --> 00:37:10.895
THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR I SAID

00:37:10.962 --> 00:37:11.796
EARLIER ANOTHER ONE WHERE WE

00:37:11.862 --> 00:37:12.964
HAVE MADE.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:14.599
LIMITED GAINES GOOD GAINS BUT

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:16.067
THE EMISSIONS LEVELS ARE STAYING

00:37:16.133 --> 00:37:17.735
FAIRLY FLAT IT'S A CRITICALLY

00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:19.403
IMPORTANT SECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:20.404
PROVIDING FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS

00:37:20.471 --> 00:37:21.505
A YEAR TO THE ECONOMY AS YOU

00:37:21.572 --> 00:37:22.940
KNOW AND PARTICULARLY CRITICAL

00:37:23.007 --> 00:37:23.941
IN KEY.

00:37:24.008 --> 00:37:25.776
AGRICULTURAL COUNTIES WE FOCUS

00:37:25.843 --> 00:37:27.845
HERE ON PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE

00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:30.014
YOU WILL BENEFITS FOR THE SECTOR

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:31.882
ITSELF TO STRENGTHEN THE SECTOR.

00:37:31.949 --> 00:37:32.950
AND STRENGTHEN CLIMATE SMART

00:37:33.017 --> 00:37:34.919
AGRICULTURE AND ALSO REDUCE ON

00:37:34.986 --> 00:37:36.887
EMISSIONS SAYS SPECIFICALLY A

00:37:36.954 --> 00:37:37.555
TEN MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE IN

00:37:37.622 --> 00:37:39.657
HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM WHICH HAS

00:37:39.724 --> 00:37:41.359
THE DOUBLE BENEFIT OF HELPING TO

00:37:41.425 --> 00:37:42.393
SEQUESTER MORE CARBON

00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.427
UNDERGROUND WHICH IS A CRITICAL

00:37:43.494 --> 00:37:44.662
PIECE OF OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY

00:37:44.729 --> 00:37:46.030
GOALS OVER THE LONG TERM.

00:37:46.097 --> 00:37:47.198
AND ALSO A TEN MILLION DOLLAR

00:37:47.264 --> 00:37:48.599
INCREASE IN THE METHANE

00:37:48.666 --> 00:37:50.134
REDUCTION PROGRAM METHANE OF

00:37:50.201 --> 00:37:51.902
COURSE IS ONE OF THE MOST POTENT.

00:37:51.969 --> 00:37:54.238
GREENHOUSE GASES ON IN IN THE

00:37:54.305 --> 00:37:55.373
NEAR TERM.

00:37:55.439 --> 00:37:56.741
IN ADDITION TO THESE TARGETED

00:37:56.807 --> 00:37:59.043
INCREASES IN KEY PROGRAMS THE

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.277
GOVERNOR'S PRIORITIZING

00:38:00.344 --> 00:38:01.779
INVESTMENT IN THE OVERALL

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:03.614
TRANSITION OF THE STATE. TO A

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:04.782
CARBON NEUTRAL NEUTRAL ECONOMY

00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:06.450
AND THESE DIRECT INVESTMENTS

00:38:06.517 --> 00:38:07.818
INCLUDE.

00:38:07.885 --> 00:38:09.654
A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.288
PROVIDING WORKFORCE TRAINING AND

00:38:11.355 --> 00:38:12.256
HIGHER TRAIN PARTNERSHIPS TO

00:38:12.323 --> 00:38:13.524
HELP IDENTIFY AND SUPPORT HIGH

00:38:13.591 --> 00:38:15.826
QUALITY JOBS ACROSS ALL THE

00:38:15.893 --> 00:38:17.662
AREAS OF INVESTMENT.

00:38:17.728 --> 00:38:19.196
I SHOULD SAY AND AND TEN RAINY

00:38:19.263 --> 00:38:19.830
FROM THE WORK FOR STILL MEMBERS

00:38:19.897 --> 00:38:21.365
HERE TO TALK MORE THIS BECAUSE

00:38:21.432 --> 00:38:22.166
WE'RE SURE YOU'LL HAVE QUESTIONS

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:22.800
ABOUT IT.

00:38:22.867 --> 00:38:24.268
WE SHOULD SAY THAT WE KNOW FROM

00:38:24.335 --> 00:38:25.369
THEIR RESEARCH AN OUTSIDE

00:38:25.436 --> 00:38:26.904
RESEARCH THAT THE MAJORITY OF

00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:28.372
JOBS CREATED BY THE GREENHOUSE

00:38:28.439 --> 00:38:29.874
GAS REDUCTION FUND INVESTMENTS

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:31.575
OVERALL ARE IN CONSTRUCTION.

00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:32.743
AND CONSTRUCTION CAREERS ARE

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:34.645
CHANGING AS WERE ASKING FOR

00:38:34.712 --> 00:38:35.613
CLEANER BUILDINGS GREENER

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.447
BUILDINGS TO CARBONIZED

00:38:36.514 --> 00:38:37.848
BUILDINGS EFFICIENT BUILDINGS

00:38:37.915 --> 00:38:39.583
WERE ASKING FOR NEW SKILLS AND

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:40.518
WE'RE ASKING FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE

00:38:40.584 --> 00:38:41.952
THE SKILLS NECESSARY TO ACTUALLY

00:38:42.019 --> 00:38:42.453
MAINTAIN THOSE EMISSION

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:43.454
REDUCTIONS.

00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:45.189
WE KNOW FROM YEARS OF STUDY THAT

00:38:45.256 --> 00:38:47.224
IF WORKERS IN THOSE FIELDS FIRST

00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:48.025
OF ALL THERE'S A LIGHT LABOR

00:38:48.092 --> 00:38:49.493
SHORTAGE IN THOSE FIELDS BECAUSE

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:50.661
OF A LACK OF TRAINING AND SOME

00:38:50.728 --> 00:38:52.029
OF THESE GREEN BUILDING.

00:38:52.096 --> 00:38:52.963
STANDARDS WE ALSO KNOW THAT

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:54.465
WORKERS IN THOSE FIELDS WHEN NOT

00:38:54.532 --> 00:38:55.800
PROPERLY TRAINED AREN'T

00:38:55.866 --> 00:38:57.535
REALIZING THOSE GAINS ENERGY

00:38:57.601 --> 00:38:59.370
EFFICIENCY GAINS ARE LOST.

00:38:59.437 --> 00:39:00.671
THROUGH ON INEFFECTIVE OPERATION

00:39:00.738 --> 00:39:03.040
MAINTENANCE AND SO WE REALLY

00:39:03.107 --> 00:39:03.507
THINK THERE'S A DIRECT

00:39:03.574 --> 00:39:04.809
CONNECTION HERE.

00:39:04.875 --> 00:39:06.777
BUT ALSO JUST A LONG TERM NEED

00:39:06.844 --> 00:39:07.545
TO THINK ABOUT THE STATE'S

00:39:07.611 --> 00:39:09.580
TRANSITION TO A CARBON NEUTRAL

00:39:09.647 --> 00:39:10.448
ECONOMY AND YOU'LL SEE IN THE

00:39:10.514 --> 00:39:12.249
MAY REVISION I INCREASE IN THAT

00:39:12.316 --> 00:39:14.819
BUDGET SPECIFICALLY TARGETED. TO

00:39:14.885 --> 00:39:16.821
THOSE COUNTIES THAT ARE

00:39:16.887 --> 00:39:17.822
PARTICULARLY DEPENDING ON

00:39:17.888 --> 00:39:19.256
DEPENDING ON FOSSIL FUELS THOSE

00:39:19.323 --> 00:39:20.791
COUNTIES ARE KERN COUNTY WE

00:39:20.858 --> 00:39:22.393
CALLED OUT IT IS THE NUMBER ONE

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.928
COUNTY -- FOR OIL AND GAS BY FAR

00:39:23.994 --> 00:39:25.496
IN THE STATE WE CALLED IT OUT

00:39:25.563 --> 00:39:26.363
BECAUSE KERN COUNTY IS ALREADY

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:27.832
SEEN JOB DECLINES THROUGH

00:39:27.898 --> 00:39:28.833
AUTOMATION.

00:39:28.899 --> 00:39:30.101
AND GLOBALIZATION ANOTHER MARKET

00:39:30.167 --> 00:39:31.869
FORCES WERE OUT THERE ALSO GOING

00:39:31.936 --> 00:39:33.237
TO SEE AND THE INDUSTRY

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:34.839
KNOWLEDGE IS THIS LONG TERM.

00:39:34.905 --> 00:39:36.107
NEED FOR DIVERSIFICATION IN THAT

00:39:36.173 --> 00:39:37.374
INDUSTRY BECAUSE OF JUST

00:39:37.441 --> 00:39:39.043
POLICIES LIKE THESE SO WE'RE

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:40.845
LOOKING AHEAD TO THAT.

00:39:40.911 --> 00:39:42.113
IN THIS PROGRAM.

00:39:42.179 --> 00:39:43.647
IN ADDITION.

00:39:43.714 --> 00:39:44.815
THE BUDGET INCLUDES SUPPORT FOR

00:39:44.882 --> 00:39:46.117
HIGHER TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS AND

00:39:46.183 --> 00:39:47.651
THOSE ARE ONE OF THE KEY.

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:48.719
I KEEP VEHICLES BRINGING

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:50.488
TOGETHER EMPLOYERS WORKERS

00:39:50.554 --> 00:39:52.523
ECONOMIC WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:56.794
AND STAKEHOLDERS TO THE

00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:57.661
COMMUNITY LEVEL TO RELEASE SEE

00:39:57.728 --> 00:39:58.229
WHERE THOSE TRANSITIONS ARE

00:39:58.295 --> 00:39:58.829
HAPPENING AND HOW WE NEED TO

00:39:58.896 --> 00:39:59.630
BETTER TRAINED. FOR THE JOBS

00:39:59.697 --> 00:40:00.231
THAT ARE EMERGING IN THE NEW

00:40:00.297 --> 00:40:02.366
CARBON YOU TROLL ECONOMY.

00:40:02.433 --> 00:40:03.434
YOU'LL ALSO SEE IN THE MIRROR

00:40:03.501 --> 00:40:04.802
VISION SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT IN

00:40:04.869 --> 00:40:06.403
THE JANUARY BUDGET WHICH IS A AT

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:07.705
ONE POINT FIVE MILLION FOR STUDY

00:40:07.772 --> 00:40:09.206
TO PROVIDE A ROADMAP.

00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:10.374
OF HOW TO DO THAT TRANSITION OR

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:12.543
CARBON NEUTRAL ECONOMY BY.

00:40:12.610 --> 00:40:13.844
TWENTY FIFTY THAT ROAD MAP WILL

00:40:13.911 --> 00:40:15.913
INCLUDE AND THIS IS NEW FOR I

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:16.947
THINK THE STATE BOTH

00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:18.315
ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC

00:40:18.382 --> 00:40:20.718
FACTORS HOW DO WE LOOK AT HOW TO

00:40:20.785 --> 00:40:22.953
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR DEMAND

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:24.121
FOR FOSSIL FUELS.

00:40:24.188 --> 00:40:26.223
AND OUR AND GET FOR CARBON

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:28.159
NEUTRALITY WILL ALSO CONSIDER

00:40:28.225 --> 00:40:29.593
HOW THE STATE WILL MANAGE THAT

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:30.795
DECLINE THAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT

00:40:30.861 --> 00:40:32.797
IMPOSSIBLE JOBS THAT'S ALREADY

00:40:32.863 --> 00:40:33.731
HAPPENING TODAY.

00:40:33.798 --> 00:40:35.199
AGAIN THROUGH AUTOMATION AND

00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:36.901
THROUGH MARKET FORCES OTHER

00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:37.868
STATES ARE SURPASSING US AND

00:40:37.935 --> 00:40:39.170
WE'LL GAS PRODUCTION.

00:40:39.236 --> 00:40:41.005
BUT ALSO JUST BECAUSE OF POLICY

00:40:41.071 --> 00:40:42.807
CHANGES ACROSS THE GLOBE.

00:40:42.873 --> 00:40:44.775
SO THAT'S THE HIGH LEVEL -- ON

00:40:44.842 --> 00:40:47.845
THE MAYOR VISION THE GENDER

00:40:47.912 --> 00:40:48.479
BUDGET IN THE MAYOR VISION AND I

00:40:48.546 --> 00:40:50.915
WILL -- LEAVE IT TO YOU FOR

00:40:50.981 --> 00:40:52.183
QUESTIONS AND I MAY CALL ON

00:40:52.249 --> 00:40:55.219
COLLEAGUES FROM AGENCIES ON ON

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:55.786
ON SPECIFIC POINTS ARE FROM

00:40:55.853 --> 00:40:57.288
FINANCE.

00:40:57.354 --> 00:41:00.257
GREAT WELL WHY DON'T WE HEAR

00:41:00.324 --> 00:41:01.292
FROM -- L. L. S. RAMP.

00:41:01.358 --> 00:41:01.926
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS

00:41:01.992 --> 00:41:03.727
ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:04.428
ANALYST'S OFFICE.

00:41:04.495 --> 00:41:05.696
BACK UP JUST A LITTLE BIT AND

00:41:05.763 --> 00:41:06.263
PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:07.531
CONTEXT ON JUST SOME OF THE

00:41:07.598 --> 00:41:08.966
NUMBERS AND THE NAY REVISION

00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:10.701
AROUND REVENUE ASSUMPTIONS AND

00:41:10.768 --> 00:41:11.268
HOW MUCH ADDITIONAL MONIES

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:12.169
ALLOCATED.

00:41:12.236 --> 00:41:14.104
SO THE ADMINISTRATION ASSUMES

00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:15.806
ROUGHLY SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

00:41:15.873 --> 00:41:17.274
MILLION DOLLARS MORE IN REVENUE

00:41:17.341 --> 00:41:19.143
OVER FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:21.011
THE BUDGET YEAR AND SO -- UNDER

00:41:21.078 --> 00:41:22.613
CURRENT LAW 60% OF THAT IS

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.914
CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED A

00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:24.982
CERTAIN PROGRAM SINCE THAT

00:41:25.049 --> 00:41:26.217
LEAVES ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED

00:41:26.283 --> 00:41:27.918
MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL

00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:28.485
REVENUE.

00:41:28.552 --> 00:41:29.620
UP BEYOND WHAT THEIR ESTIMATED

00:41:29.687 --> 00:41:32.156
IN JANUARY AND SO OF THAT THREE

00:41:32.223 --> 00:41:33.390
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS -- THE

00:41:33.457 --> 00:41:34.859
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES ALLOCATE

00:41:34.925 --> 00:41:36.393
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:38.996
DOLLARS MORE TO THE VARIOUS

00:41:39.063 --> 00:41:40.331
PROGRAMS THAT.

00:41:40.397 --> 00:41:41.198
THE DIRECTOR JUST MENTIONED

00:41:41.265 --> 00:41:43.334
RIGHT NOW -- JUST ON THE REVENUE

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.368
ESTIMATES IN GENERAL WE THINK

00:41:44.435 --> 00:41:46.003
THAT THEIR ESTIMATES ARE ARE

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:47.872
REASONABLE AND OUR ESTIMATES ARE

00:41:47.938 --> 00:41:49.807
VERY SIMILAR TO THEIRS -- ONE

00:41:49.874 --> 00:41:51.642
SMALL DIFFERENCE WE HAVE IS --

00:41:51.709 --> 00:41:53.110
AN ESTIMATE ON REVENUE ON THE

00:41:53.177 --> 00:41:54.678
NAY AUCTION WHICH ACTUALLY JUST

00:41:54.745 --> 00:41:56.413
OCCURRED YESTERDAY WE WON'T KNOW

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.781
THE RESULTS OF THAT AUCTION OR

00:41:57.848 --> 00:41:59.216
THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS UNTIL

00:41:59.283 --> 00:42:00.784
NEXT WEEK SOMETIME.

00:42:00.851 --> 00:42:02.253
BUT WE DO EXPECT THE REVENUE

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:04.288
WILL LIKELY BE A SOMEWHAT HIGHER

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:05.289
THAN THE ADMINISTRATION

00:42:05.356 --> 00:42:06.724
ESTIMATED WE ESTIMATE ABOUT.

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:08.492
A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

00:42:08.559 --> 00:42:10.794
HIGHER BASED ON CURRENT PRICES

00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:12.663
FOR ALLOWANCES THAT WOULD LEAVE

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:14.231
AGAIN TAKING OUT THE 60%

00:42:14.298 --> 00:42:16.600
CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATIONS ABOUT

00:42:16.667 --> 00:42:17.334
SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS.

00:42:17.401 --> 00:42:18.802
MORE A POTENTIALLY ONCE WE SEE

00:42:18.869 --> 00:42:20.004
THE RESULTS ABOUT OPTION THAT

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:21.705
THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO

00:42:21.772 --> 00:42:23.607
CONSIDER ALLOCATING EITHER IN

00:42:23.674 --> 00:42:26.443
THIS BUDGET OR IN FUTURE BUDGETS --

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:27.378
AND SO WHAT WILL UPDATE THE

00:42:27.444 --> 00:42:28.512
LEGISLATURE ONCE THAT THAT

00:42:28.579 --> 00:42:29.980
INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

00:42:30.047 --> 00:42:32.449
ON THAT PARTICULAR ALLOCATIONS I

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:34.251
THINK AS WE'VE MENTIONED BEFORE --

00:42:34.318 --> 00:42:36.654
REALLY IT MOSTLY COMES DOWN TO

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.489
THE ADMINISTRATION OR EXCUSE ME

00:42:38.555 --> 00:42:40.658
THE LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES ON

00:42:40.724 --> 00:42:41.659
HOW IT PRIORITIZE IS DIFFERENT

00:42:41.725 --> 00:42:42.760
BENEFITS THAT COULD BE ACHIEVED

00:42:42.826 --> 00:42:44.228
THROUGH THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:44.762
YOU HEARD A LOT ABOUT THE

00:42:44.828 --> 00:42:45.796
ADMINISTRATION.

00:42:45.863 --> 00:42:47.064
PRIORITIZING TRANSPORTATION

00:42:47.131 --> 00:42:48.632
EMISSIONS -- AND THAT MAKES A

00:42:48.699 --> 00:42:49.500
LOT OF SENSE FOR A LOT OF

00:42:49.566 --> 00:42:50.634
DIFFERENT REASONS BOTH ON THE

00:42:50.701 --> 00:42:52.136
GREENHOUSE GAS SIDE.

00:42:52.202 --> 00:42:52.636
AS WELL AS THE LOCAL AIR

00:42:52.703 --> 00:42:54.438
POLLUTION SIDE OF THINGS BUT

00:42:54.505 --> 00:42:55.606
THERE ARE A WIDE VARIETY OF

00:42:55.673 --> 00:42:56.740
OTHER PROGRAMS OF COURSE THAT

00:42:56.807 --> 00:42:57.775
THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANT TO

00:42:57.841 --> 00:42:58.976
CONSIDER ALLOCATE IN THIS

00:42:59.043 --> 00:43:01.812
ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO FUND INTO.

00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:02.346
A DEPENDING ON WHAT IT'S

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:03.681
PRIORITIES PRIORITIES ARE

00:43:03.747 --> 00:43:05.950
WHETHER THAT BE ADAPTATION --

00:43:06.016 --> 00:43:08.485
RESEARCH SHORE OR OTHER THINGS

00:43:08.552 --> 00:43:15.159

DID.

00:43:25.803 --> 00:43:28.372
CAP AND TRADE WEEK WE THIS

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:30.341
CONTINUES THE DISCUSS CLEAN AIR

00:43:30.407 --> 00:43:31.442
WITH A CONTINUES TO DISCUSS

00:43:31.508 --> 00:43:34.979
VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES -- AND WE

00:43:35.045 --> 00:43:36.246
CAN TO LEASES BECAUSE MARRYING

THESE ISSUES AND WE AND AND THAT --

00:43:38.315 --> 00:43:39.883
BUT THEY BE SIX SEVENTEEN ALONG

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:42.086
THE WAY WE HAVE THE FIRST SET OF

00:43:42.152 --> 00:43:42.886
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN THE

00:43:42.953 --> 00:43:44.922
PROCESS OF CREATING ACTION PLANS

00:43:44.989 --> 00:43:45.723
AND WE HAVE.

00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:47.825
DOLLARS ASIDE THEIR LATER THIS

00:43:47.891 --> 00:43:48.892
YEAR WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:50.461
SELECTING A SECOND SET OF

00:43:50.527 --> 00:43:52.496
COMMUNITIES -- BUT I SEE THAT

00:43:52.563 --> 00:43:53.864
WE'RE NOT DOING ANY INCREASE

00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:55.265
YOUR FOR COMMUNITY ACTION PLANS

00:43:55.332 --> 00:43:56.767
ARE FOR THAT WORK UNTIL

00:43:56.834 --> 00:43:58.802
WONDERING IF THAT'S SOMETHING.

00:43:58.869 --> 00:43:59.670
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:00.971
LOOKED INTO OUR WHY THE CHOICES

00:44:01.038 --> 00:44:02.706
NOT TO AUGMENT THAT.

00:44:02.773 --> 00:44:03.774
THAT BUDGET.

00:44:03.841 --> 00:44:04.742
THERE'S PROBABLY SOMEONE FROM

00:44:04.808 --> 00:44:06.076
AIR BE HERE WHO CAN SPEAK TO

00:44:06.143 --> 00:44:06.977
THIS AS WELL BUT OUR

00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:08.278
UNDERSTANDING WE LOOK VERY

00:44:08.345 --> 00:44:09.279
CLOSELY THAT AND THANK YOU FOR

00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:10.547
THAT BUILT BY THE WAITT WE LOOK

00:44:10.614 --> 00:44:12.016
VERY CLOSELY AT THAT PROGRAM AND

00:44:12.082 --> 00:44:13.584
WE WERE.

00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.319
GIVEN THE EIGHT WE WERE INFORMED

00:44:15.386 --> 00:44:17.287
BY I AIR BE THAT ESSENTIALLY TWO

00:44:17.354 --> 00:44:18.922
HUNDRED WAS WAS THE MAXIMUM THAT

00:44:18.989 --> 00:44:20.858
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEND ON

00:44:20.924 --> 00:44:22.659
THE PROGRAM AT THIS TIME.

00:44:22.726 --> 00:44:24.194
GIVEN ALL KINDS OF THINGS

00:44:24.261 --> 00:44:25.896
CAPACITY TIME LINES -- DEADLINES

00:44:25.963 --> 00:44:27.398
ETCETERA SO WE ACTUALLY LOOKED

00:44:27.464 --> 00:44:29.066
SPECIFICALLY AND INCREASES THEIR

00:44:29.133 --> 00:44:29.833
AND WORK.

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.235
TALK THROUGH IT AND WERE GIVEN

00:44:31.301 --> 00:44:32.302
TO UNDERSTAND THAT AN INCREASE

00:44:32.369 --> 00:44:33.370
AT THIS TIME WOULDN'T ACTUALLY

00:44:33.437 --> 00:44:34.972
CREATE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS BUT

00:44:35.039 --> 00:44:37.007
WE SHOULD LOOK AT IT AGAIN.

00:44:37.074 --> 00:44:37.674
THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER AND SO

00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:38.876
THEN MY SECOND PART OF THE

00:44:38.942 --> 00:44:40.377
QUESTION OR MAYBE IT'S MORE OF A

00:44:40.444 --> 00:44:42.146
STATEMENT AT THIS POINT.

00:44:42.212 --> 00:44:43.313
IS.

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:46.116
AS WE ADD MORE THINGS INTO HOW

00:44:46.183 --> 00:44:47.551
WE SPLIT UP OUR CAP AND TRADE

00:44:47.618 --> 00:44:48.552
DOLLARS WE SET UP CERTAIN

00:44:48.619 --> 00:44:50.254
EXPECTATIONS WHILE IT MIGHT BE A

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:51.088
ONE TIME ALLOCATIONS PEOPLE

00:44:51.155 --> 00:44:52.389
START TO BELIEVE THAT THESE

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:53.924
MIGHT BE CONTINUOUS.

00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:54.925
AND IT'S HARDER TO TAKE IT AWAY

00:44:54.992 --> 00:44:56.593
LATER ON AND TO GIVE IT INTO

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.195
KNOWING THAT MAYBE AT THIS POINT

00:44:58.262 --> 00:44:59.663
THE AIR BE IF I CAPACITY BUT

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:00.664
THESE TEN COMMUNITIES ARE COMING

00:45:00.731 --> 00:45:01.331
UP.

00:45:01.398 --> 00:45:03.367
WE HAVE AT LEAST TEN COMMUNITY

00:45:03.434 --> 00:45:05.235
ACTION PLANS WE DIVVY UP THE

00:45:05.302 --> 00:45:06.203
MONEY OR LIKE IN ABOUT TWENTY

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:07.805
MILLION PER ACTION PLAN WHICH

00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:09.506
THE REALITY MEANS THAT. ONE

00:45:09.573 --> 00:45:11.241
YEAR'S NOT GONNA COMPLETE THAT

00:45:11.308 --> 00:45:13.177
ACTION PLAN THERE WILL BE MORE

00:45:13.243 --> 00:45:13.777
MANY NEED EFFORTLESS ACTION

00:45:13.844 --> 00:45:14.745
PLANS PLUS THE TEN YOU

00:45:14.812 --> 00:45:16.513
COMMUNITIES THAT COME IN LATER

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:17.981
IN THE YEAR AND AND SO FORTH AND

00:45:18.048 --> 00:45:18.415
SO.

00:45:18.482 --> 00:45:20.417
I ARE WE CONSIDERING YOU SEEN

00:45:20.484 --> 00:45:21.785
GENERAL FUND FOR SOME OF THESE

00:45:21.852 --> 00:45:23.987
THINGS -- WE HAVE SOME GOOD

00:45:24.054 --> 00:45:24.788
IDEAS IN HERE RIGHT

00:45:24.855 --> 00:45:32.763
TRANSPORTATION IS ONE OF MY

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:34.998
BIGGEST ISSUES IN MY BACKYARD --

00:45:35.065 --> 00:45:37.534
TRANSFORMATIVE CAN A COMMUNITY --

00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:38.335
IS ANOTHER VERY PREGNANT SO BOTH

00:45:38.402 --> 00:45:39.002
HAVE WE CONSIDERED THE FACT THAT

00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:39.837
WE HAVE ALL THESE EXTRA DOLLARS

00:45:39.903 --> 00:45:41.004
IN OUR GENERAL FUND AND DOING

00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:42.406
DOING SOME OF OUR CLIMATE CHANGE

00:45:42.473 --> 00:45:43.507
WORK AND SEWER CLEANER WORK AND

00:45:43.574 --> 00:45:44.041
PAYING FOR IT.

00:45:44.108 --> 00:45:45.476
FROM GENERAL FUND THIS WELL I

00:45:45.542 --> 00:45:47.010
DON'T THINK.

00:45:47.077 --> 00:45:48.212
I DON'T THINK WE EXPECTED COMEDY

00:45:48.278 --> 00:45:49.413
A TEACHER R. F.. TO BE THE ONLY

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:50.047
SOURCE FOR THESE DOLLARS IN OUR

00:45:50.114 --> 00:45:52.649
ONLY SOLUTION AND IT'S A LOT OF

00:45:52.716 --> 00:45:53.951
ENOUGH MONEY BE ASKED ME AND I

00:45:54.017 --> 00:45:55.152
WILL I LIVE FINANCE ENTER IF

00:45:55.219 --> 00:45:56.653
THEY IF THEY LIKE TO GO TO THAT

00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:58.055
THE ONE THING I WILL SAY IS THAT

00:45:58.122 --> 00:45:58.856
THE ADMINISTRATION.

00:45:58.922 --> 00:46:01.058
HAS BEEN VERY FOCUSED ON EXACTLY

00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:02.359
THIS POINT OF INTEGRATING

00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:04.528
CLIMATE GOALS PARTICULARLY

00:46:04.595 --> 00:46:05.929
AROUND RESILIENCE AND

00:46:05.996 --> 00:46:07.498
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN TWO

00:46:07.564 --> 00:46:09.066
OTHER PROGRAMS THAT DON'T SHOW

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:10.667
UP HERE IN THE JEEP CHEROKEE

00:46:10.734 --> 00:46:11.668
IT'S NOT THE ONLY PART OF MONEY.

00:46:11.735 --> 00:46:12.736
THAT NEEDS TO BE FOCUSED ON

00:46:12.803 --> 00:46:14.605
THESE ISSUES SO IF YOU LOOK AT

00:46:14.671 --> 00:46:15.606
THROUGHOUT THE BUDGET THAT THE

00:46:15.672 --> 00:46:16.673
HOUSING PRIORITIES FOR INSTANCE

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:17.841
IN THE FOCUS ON INFILL

00:46:17.908 --> 00:46:20.177
INFRASTRUCTURE -- AS A AS A AS A

00:46:20.244 --> 00:46:21.778
STRATEGY TO BRING DOWN VEHICLE

00:46:21.845 --> 00:46:23.380
EMISSIONS THROUGH HOUSING THERE

00:46:23.447 --> 00:46:24.481
OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE THAT AS WELL

00:46:24.548 --> 00:46:25.849
SO I WILL I FULLY AGREE WITH YOU

00:46:25.916 --> 00:46:28.051
THIS IS NOT THE ONLY PLACE WHERE

00:46:28.118 --> 00:46:28.652
WE SHOULD BE REFLECTING THESE

00:46:28.719 --> 00:46:29.853
PRIORITIES.

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.221
THE OTHER POINT IS THAT EACH OF

00:46:31.288 --> 00:46:32.222
THESE TO YOUR DESERVES

00:46:32.289 --> 00:46:33.123
COMMUNITIES POINT.

00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:34.658
EACH OF THESE OTHER PRIORITIES --

00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:38.629
I THINK THERE IS A STRONG FOCUS

00:46:38.695 --> 00:46:41.565
ON ON EQUITY WERE ON THE

00:46:41.632 --> 00:46:43.033
TRANSFER OF CLIMATE COMMITTEES

00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:44.935
PROGRAM THE ENHANCE FLEET BIT

00:46:45.002 --> 00:46:46.003
MODERNIZATION PROGRAM AND DIESEL.

00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:47.037
POLLUTION GENERALLY ALL HAVE A

00:46:47.104 --> 00:46:47.604
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THIS

00:46:47.671 --> 00:46:48.639
COMMUNITY SO WE WOULD SAY THAT

00:46:48.705 --> 00:46:49.873
THE SIX SEVENTEEN IS A BIG PIECE

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.241
OF THAT AND PARTICULARLY WHERE

00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:52.409
THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE COMES

00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:52.809
IN.

00:46:52.876 --> 00:46:55.479
BUT THAT THAT'S A THEME

00:46:55.546 --> 00:46:58.215
THROUGHOUT THESE INCREASES.

00:46:58.282 --> 00:47:01.485
DID YOU PRESS ONE OF AN AND AND

00:47:01.552 --> 00:47:02.553
THEN JUST TO REITERATE THE POINT

00:47:02.619 --> 00:47:04.621
WHETHER IT'S AB SIX SEVENTEEN OR

00:47:04.688 --> 00:47:05.689
OTHER WAYS YOU'RE GIVING UP

00:47:05.756 --> 00:47:06.723
MONIES.

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:08.759
YOU MENTIONED HOW WERE NOT

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:10.093
GETTING THE MISSIONS THAT WE

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.662
WOULD HOLE FOR RIGHT IN AND WE

00:47:11.728 --> 00:47:13.697
TALKED ABOUT THE AG SECTOR AND

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:14.665
WE'VE BEEN PRETTY GENEROUS OVER

00:47:14.731 --> 00:47:16.133
THE YEARS AND THE SAME QUESTION

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.768
HAS COME UP WITH AB SIX

00:47:17.834 --> 00:47:18.435
SEVENTEEN OF WHAT ARE WE PUTTING

00:47:18.502 --> 00:47:20.204
IN PLACE NOW. TO MAKE SURE WE

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:21.572
ARE TRACKING RESULT IN ARE WE

00:47:21.638 --> 00:47:23.507
INVESTING THE MONEY THE BEST

00:47:23.574 --> 00:47:25.475
WAYS HOW ARE IF OUR EARLY

00:47:25.542 --> 00:47:26.777
INVESTMENTS HAVING GIVEN AS THE

00:47:26.843 --> 00:47:28.512
VESSEL SHOULD WE KEEP PUTTING

00:47:28.579 --> 00:47:29.446
MORE MONEY INTO THE SAME

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:30.714
PROGRAMS.

00:47:30.781 --> 00:47:31.381
ARE SURELY BE YOU KNOW THINKING

00:47:31.448 --> 00:47:32.950
ALONG THE WAY AND SO IT'S

00:47:33.016 --> 00:47:34.685
SOMETHING THAT I HAVE CONCERNS

00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:38.355
NOT JUST WITH -- WITH.

00:47:38.422 --> 00:47:39.690
YOU KNOW WITH THE AG INDUSTRY

00:47:39.756 --> 00:47:42.092
BUT ALSO WITH AND EVEN THE A. B.

00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:42.693
SIX SEVENTEEN WORK I WAS JUST

00:47:42.759 --> 00:47:43.327
TRYING MONEY RANDOMLY THIS ANY

00:47:43.393 --> 00:47:43.961
ABOUT WORKING OR NOT AND WHAT

00:47:44.027 --> 00:47:45.529
ARE WE DOING. TO MAKE SURE WE'RE

00:47:45.596 --> 00:47:47.164
LEARNING AND ADJUSTING ALONG THE

00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:49.132
WAY PART OF IT IS THAT A LOT IS

00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:50.567
NEW RIGHT WE'RE HAVING TO LEARN

00:47:50.634 --> 00:47:52.302
ALONG THE WAY BUT ARE WE MAKING

00:47:52.369 --> 00:47:53.003
SURE THAT WE'RE STOPPING A

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:54.304
REFLECTING ON THOSE LESSONS ON A

00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:55.439
REGULAR BASIS.

00:47:55.505 --> 00:47:57.174
IT'S A GREAT QUESTION -- I THINK

00:47:57.241 --> 00:48:00.110
THAT THE SB ONE FIFTY REPORT WAS

00:48:00.177 --> 00:48:00.978
ACTUALLY VERY HELPFUL IN SORT OF

00:48:01.044 --> 00:48:02.212
CALLING THE QUESTION ON SOME OF

00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:03.714
THESE INVESTMENTS AND REALLY

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:04.314
POINTED TO THE TRANSPORTATION

00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:05.782
ISSUE.

00:48:05.849 --> 00:48:07.284
I WOULD SAY THAT I'M IN THE

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:08.619
AGRICULTURE SECTOR SPECIFICALLY

00:48:08.685 --> 00:48:10.120
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN

00:48:10.187 --> 00:48:11.555
DONE TO SHOW THAT THAT YOU KNOW

00:48:11.622 --> 00:48:12.623
THE SALT AND MAPPING PROGRAMS IN

00:48:12.689 --> 00:48:14.091
PARTICULAR ARE VERY GOOD

00:48:14.157 --> 00:48:15.726
INVESTMENTS IN TERMS OF GHG

00:48:15.792 --> 00:48:17.494
REDUCTION FOR THE MONEY.

00:48:17.561 --> 00:48:18.695
ON THESE ARE SECTORS THAT ARE

00:48:18.762 --> 00:48:20.163
INDUSTRIAL SECTORS THAT ARE

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:21.198
GROWING AND SO THERE IS THAT

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:22.633
TENSION AND I THINK WE DO NEED

00:48:22.699 --> 00:48:24.067
TO CONTINUE LOOKING AT THAT BUT

00:48:24.134 --> 00:48:25.402
IT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS

00:48:25.469 --> 00:48:26.770
WERE LOOKING AT THAT LONG TO

00:48:26.837 --> 00:48:28.372
STUDY TO REALLY SAY WHAT WE MEAN

00:48:28.438 --> 00:48:28.705
WHEN WE SAY.

00:48:28.772 --> 00:48:30.140
CARBON NEUTRALITY AND HOW DO WE

00:48:30.207 --> 00:48:32.209
ACTUALLY GET THERE WHAT'S THE

00:48:32.276 --> 00:48:34.311
LONG VIEW.

THIS ZERO EMISSION.

00:50:26.256 --> 00:50:28.759
IT'S A GOOD QUESTION AIR BE

00:50:28.825 --> 00:50:29.025
QUESTION.

00:50:29.092 --> 00:50:31.294
HERE.

00:50:31.361 --> 00:50:33.797
WE DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT

EVERY PROGRAM IT TURNS OUT. TO

00:50:35.499 --> 00:50:37.801

WOULD ACTUALLY BROWN.

00:50:48.412 --> 00:50:49.379
OR CLEAN TRUCK AND BUS FUNDING

00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:50.514
DOES GO TO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:54.584
TECHNOLOGIES -- ZERO MISSION OF

00:50:54.651 --> 00:50:55.685
THE BATTERY ELECTRIC IN FUEL

00:50:55.752 --> 00:51:00.190
CELL ALSO -- LOW KNOCKS --

00:51:00.257 --> 00:51:02.192
INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES AND

00:51:02.259 --> 00:51:04.561
HYBRID EQUIPMENT HYBRID VEHICLE

00:51:04.628 --> 00:51:06.563
SO IT IT REALLY IS A COMBINATION

00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:08.799
OF THOSE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES

00:51:08.865 --> 00:51:11.101
AND THE FUNDING WHICH WOULD BE

TRANSFORM THE FREIGHT PROJECTS.

00:51:20.944 --> 00:51:23.280
IS THIS A CHANGE IN THE WAY THE

00:51:23.346 --> 00:51:24.281
PROGRAMS OF ALL.

00:51:24.347 --> 00:51:27.350
NO THIS IS -- IT DID THIS SHOULD

00:51:27.417 --> 00:51:28.819
BE ALLOWING US TO CONTAIN IT

00:51:28.885 --> 00:51:31.421
SPEND THESE PROGRAMS TO MEET THE

DEAD.

00:51:32.956 --> 00:51:33.990
DEMAND THAT'S THE TO COMING IN

00:51:34.057 --> 00:51:35.559
BECAUSE IN THE END WE WANT TO BE

00:51:35.625 --> 00:51:36.159
ZERO EMISSION.

00:51:36.226 --> 00:51:40.864
HOW IS THAT HOW IS IT GOING TO

00:51:40.931 --> 00:51:45.101
BE DIVIDED UP -- SO. ZERO

00:51:45.168 --> 00:51:47.471
MISSION IS NOT -- THERE FOR ALL

00:51:47.537 --> 00:51:49.506
OF YOU KNOW FOR ALL POLL.

00:51:49.573 --> 00:51:50.707
OPERATIONS IN VEHICLE CLASSES SO

00:51:50.774 --> 00:51:54.744

FOR WORK -- IT IS FOR FUNDING

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:56.546
FOR COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE

00:51:56.613 --> 00:51:59.082
TECHNOLOGIES IN SOME CASES IT'S

00:51:59.149 --> 00:52:00.417
ZERO MISSION IN SOME CASES IT'S

00:52:00.484 --> 00:52:01.852
HYBRID IN SOME CASES IT'S LOW

00:52:01.918 --> 00:52:02.519
KNOCKS.

00:52:02.586 --> 00:52:04.387
AND THEN WE DO A DEMONSTRATION

00:52:04.454 --> 00:52:06.456
PROJECTS TO TRY AND BRING

00:52:06.523 --> 00:52:07.891
CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES TAUGHT. TO

00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:10.627

00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:08.084
AND OFF ROAD.

00:53:08.151 --> 00:53:10.787
VEHICLES. FIFTY MILLION THERE

00:53:10.854 --> 00:53:12.622
SEEMS TO BE.

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:13.890
IF WE'RE SAYING THAT ADDRESS IS

00:53:13.957 --> 00:53:15.659
BETTER.

00:53:15.725 --> 00:53:17.561
THEN THE OTHERS YET WE'RE

00:53:17.627 --> 00:53:20.530
SPENDING SO MUCH MORE TIME ON AG.

00:53:20.597 --> 00:53:21.631
I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT

00:53:21.698 --> 00:53:23.433
THAT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT MY AG

00:53:23.500 --> 00:53:27.170
COLLEAGUES.

00:53:27.237 --> 00:53:27.771
IT MAY BE THAT SOMEBODY FROM

00:53:27.837 --> 00:53:28.805
CDFA WANTS TO SPEAK MORE TO THIS

00:53:28.872 --> 00:53:30.707
I'LL JUST SAY THAT THE AG

00:53:30.774 --> 00:53:32.676
VEHICLE PROGRAM DIESEL REDUCTION

00:53:32.742 --> 00:53:34.244
PROGRAM IS AT THE INTERSECTION

00:53:34.311 --> 00:53:34.711
OF TRANSPORTATION AND

00:53:34.778 --> 00:53:35.545
AGRICULTURE.

00:53:35.612 --> 00:53:37.147
SO IT'S IT'S ACTUALLY SORT OF

00:53:37.213 --> 00:53:38.315
ALMOST AT THE INTERSECTION

00:53:38.381 --> 00:53:39.049
TRANSPORTATION AGRICULTURE AND

00:53:39.115 --> 00:53:41.084
INDUSTRY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:42.352
VEHICLES THAT ARE IN IT VIEW

00:53:42.419 --> 00:53:43.620
BEING USED IN THE AGRICULTURAL

00:53:43.687 --> 00:53:46.323
SECTOR BUT THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING.

00:53:46.389 --> 00:53:48.191
TO DIESEL AIR POLLUTION IN THOSE

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:49.192
COMMUNITIES SO IT'S A IT'S AN

00:53:49.259 --> 00:53:50.961
INTERSECTION OF THOSE TWO THINGS

00:53:51.027 --> 00:53:51.695
WHICH IS WHY.

00:53:51.761 --> 00:53:52.996
IT'S SO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

00:53:53.063 --> 00:53:54.864
THESE ARE ALSO -- VEHICLES THAT

00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:57.400
ARE -- ARE ARE USED EVERY DAY

00:53:57.467 --> 00:53:57.968
THEY'RE USED A LOT OF HOT

00:53:58.034 --> 00:54:00.003
WEATHER THERE USED IN PARTS OF

00:54:00.070 --> 00:54:00.870
THE STATE WHERE AIR.

00:54:00.937 --> 00:54:02.305
POLLUTION STAYS IN THE SAME

00:54:02.372 --> 00:54:03.440
PLACE FOR A LONG TIME DOESN'T

00:54:03.506 --> 00:54:04.641
BLOW AWAY SO THERE'S A

00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:06.142
PARTICULAR INTEREST IN LOWERING

00:54:06.209 --> 00:54:07.410
POLLUTION.

00:54:07.477 --> 00:54:11.848
IN THOSE AREAS -- SO THAT'S THE

00:54:11.915 --> 00:54:13.550
ONE KEY WAY TO DO IT.

00:54:13.617 --> 00:54:14.718
WELCOME TO MY AREA THAT'S YOU

00:54:14.784 --> 00:54:16.152
KNOW ONE OF THOSE AREAS WHERE

00:54:16.219 --> 00:54:16.987
DOES STAY THERE.

00:54:17.053 --> 00:54:17.621
BUT WE WE DON'T HAVE THE AG BUT

00:54:17.687 --> 00:54:19.956
WE DO HAVE IS A LOT OF WE'RE

00:54:20.023 --> 00:54:22.359
WE'RE RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

00:54:22.425 --> 00:54:25.462
THE THE THE TRANSPORTATION --

00:54:25.528 --> 00:54:27.764
THAT COMES FROM THE PORTS INTO

00:54:27.831 --> 00:54:31.067
THE WAREHOUSES -- AND IT'S ALL

00:54:31.134 --> 00:54:32.969
THOSE DIESEL TRUCKS WERE IN A

00:54:33.036 --> 00:54:35.372
VALLEY AND IT ALL STAYS THERE SO

00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:36.539
WE GET EVERYTHING FROM LOS

00:54:36.606 --> 00:54:38.108
ANGELES WITH ALL DUE RESPECT MY

00:54:38.174 --> 00:54:40.377
LA PEOPLE -- BUT IT ALL COMES

00:54:40.443 --> 00:54:41.578
FROM LA AND THEN ALSO THOSE

00:54:41.645 --> 00:54:42.779
TRUCKS FOR THE PORTS AND THAT'S

00:54:42.846 --> 00:54:44.848
AB WE WANT THE INDUSTRY BUT WE

00:54:44.914 --> 00:54:45.949
DON'T WANT TO HAVE THAT RIGHT

00:54:46.016 --> 00:54:47.784
HARM TO OUR PEOPLE.

00:54:47.851 --> 00:54:49.519
THAT'S EXACTLY I MEAN I I GREW

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:50.820
AGREE WITH YOU THIS IS WHY THE

00:54:50.887 --> 00:54:52.622
JANUARY BUDGET STARTED THE CLEAN

00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:53.790
TRUCKS DIESEL NUMBER SO MUCH

00:54:53.857 --> 00:54:55.091
HIGHER THAN THE AYE NUMBER AND

00:54:55.158 --> 00:54:57.761
THE NUMBR STILL COMES OUT AT

00:54:57.827 --> 00:54:58.962
ONE EIGHTY TWO VERSUS -- FINAL

00:54:59.029 --> 00:55:00.764
NUMBER OF NINETY IN THE AG

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:02.365
SECTOR SO ABSOLUTELY BOTH OF

00:55:02.432 --> 00:55:04.901
THOSE ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT

00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:06.870
IN THESE PARTS OF THE DEEPLY AND

00:55:06.936 --> 00:55:07.437
ON THEIR EMPIRE AND CENTRAL

00:55:07.504 --> 00:55:07.671
VALLEY.

00:55:07.737 --> 00:55:08.772
OF BOTH OF THESE INDUSTRIES ARE

00:55:08.838 --> 00:55:09.539
GROWING.

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:10.440
THERE'S A LOT OF VEHICLES

00:55:10.507 --> 00:55:11.675
THERE'S A LOT OF POLLUTION FROM

00:55:11.741 --> 00:55:12.776
THE VEHICLE SO BOTH ARE

00:55:12.842 --> 00:55:14.110
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT BUT YOU'LL

00:55:14.177 --> 00:55:15.712
SEE THAT THAT IF YOU LOOK ACROSS

00:55:15.779 --> 00:55:19.582
BOTH THE JANUARY AND THE MAY

00:55:19.649 --> 00:55:22.686
BUDGET WHERE THAT COMES OUT.

00:55:22.752 --> 00:55:23.453
AT NIGHT AND IT'S STILL I WANT

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.221
TO SAY THAT IT IS IT IS STILL OF

00:55:25.288 --> 00:55:25.722
CONCERN.

00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:26.756
THAT IN THE INLAND EMPIRE VERY

00:55:26.823 --> 00:55:31.494
SPECIFICALLY -- THAT WE WE DO WE

00:55:31.561 --> 00:55:31.828
DO.

00:55:31.895 --> 00:55:33.863
WE ARE RECEIVING SO MUCH MORE.

00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:35.632
OF WHAT WE DON'T WANT AND

00:55:35.699 --> 00:55:38.935
FINDING WAYS TO TO TAKE CARE OF

00:55:39.002 --> 00:55:42.038
OF THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:43.940
TO TO THE COMMUNITY THANK YOU.

THAT THE TRUCKS START AT THE

00:55:50.246 --> 00:55:51.381
PORT AND HAD THROUGH MY DISTRICT

00:55:51.448 --> 00:55:53.283

A LOT OF THEM IN HER AREA -- NOT

00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:02.592
AT ALL ANY AG IN MY AREA BUT 5%

00:56:02.659 --> 00:56:03.827
WAS POLLUTED AIR ALSO IT'S THE

00:56:03.893 --> 00:56:05.428
THIRD BETWEEN THE THE FREEWAYS

00:56:05.495 --> 00:56:06.529
IN THE RAILYARDS.

00:56:06.596 --> 00:56:07.163
AND WE'RE SEEING THIS ROTH AND

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:08.598
WE'RE HAPPY FOR ITS GOOD FOR THE

00:56:08.665 --> 00:56:10.834
ECONOMY BUT IT'S IMPACTING IS

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:11.901
REALLY ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES

00:56:11.968 --> 00:56:13.436
AND SO THE STRUCK ISSUES ALSO

00:56:13.503 --> 00:56:14.471
REALLY IMPORTANT.

00:56:14.537 --> 00:56:17.941
AS WE SEE THE CONNECTION THERE.

00:56:18.007 --> 00:56:19.843
THANK YOU THINK [inaudible]

00:56:19.909 --> 00:56:21.511

KNOW I WAS DISAPPOINTED -- TO

00:56:25.281 --> 00:56:27.083
NOT SEAT FUNDING FOR GREEN

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:30.120
SPACES -- AND I KNOW WE'VE

00:56:30.186 --> 00:56:31.855
DISCUSSED THIS BEFORE AND IN

00:56:31.921 --> 00:56:34.224
OTHER HEARINGS -- THE LACK OF

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:35.792
FUNDING FOR THAT YOU KNOW I

00:56:35.859 --> 00:56:37.260
THINK OUR LOW ESPECIALLY OUR LOW

00:56:37.327 --> 00:56:38.928
INCOME COMMUNITIES NEED MORE

00:56:38.995 --> 00:56:41.931
PARKS AND TREES -- URBAN

00:56:41.998 --> 00:56:44.968
FORESTRY SO DOES THIS MY MISSING

00:56:45.034 --> 00:56:46.703
SOMETHING OR DOES THIS PROPOSAL.

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:49.672
REINSTATE THAT FUNDING SO UGH

00:56:49.739 --> 00:56:51.474

YOU'RE USED TO SEEING IT -- THE

00:56:52.509 --> 00:56:53.777
TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE

00:56:53.843 --> 00:56:55.178
COMMUNITIES PROGRAM DOES HAVE A

00:56:55.245 --> 00:56:56.713
FOCUS ON URBAN ON GREENING AS

00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:58.148
PART OF ITS PROJECT SO THAT'S

00:56:58.214 --> 00:56:59.415
WHERE YOU SEE THAT FOCUSES THAT

00:56:59.482 --> 00:57:01.951
INCREASE AN INTEGRATED APPROACH.

00:57:02.018 --> 00:57:03.119
TO COMMUNITY SKILL DEVELOPMENT

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:04.888
IN MOST IS ADVANCE COMMIT THE

00:57:04.954 --> 00:57:05.622
MOST AS A BENCH COMMITTEES OF

00:57:05.688 --> 00:57:07.590
THE STATE WITH THAT COMBINATION

00:57:07.657 --> 00:57:09.425
OF HOUSING AND DEPENDING ON THE

00:57:09.492 --> 00:57:10.226
PROJECT AND WHAT THE COMMUNITY

00:57:10.293 --> 00:57:10.693
WANTS.

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:11.861
COMBINATION OF HOUSING

00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:13.463
TRANSPORTATION GREEN SPACES AND

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:15.031
CLIMATE RESILIENCE THAT'S WHERE

00:57:15.098 --> 00:57:16.366
YOU SEE THAT INCORPORATED.

00:57:16.432 --> 00:57:25.208
SO AS PART OF A MORE INTEGRATED

00:57:25.275 --> 00:57:26.442
COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT.

00:57:26.509 --> 00:57:27.377
OKAY BUT BEFORE IT WAS MORE

00:57:27.443 --> 00:57:28.378
AVAILABLE TO OTHER COMMUNITIES

00:57:28.444 --> 00:57:30.146
REGARDLESS IF THEY QUALIFY THAT.

00:57:30.213 --> 00:57:31.314
FOR THAT TRANSFORMATIVE CLIMATE

PROJECT -- BIG.

00:57:35.151 --> 00:57:37.187
SO THAT THAT'S JUST MIGHT NOT IT

00:57:37.253 --> 00:57:40.924
MIGHT TAKE HER IN FOR SURE.

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:41.691

CATEGORIES HOWEVER.

00:59:23.092 --> 00:59:24.861
THE BEG THE QUESTION WHY WHY NOT --

00:59:24.928 --> 00:59:26.763
URBAN GREENING URBAN FORESTRY

00:59:26.829 --> 00:59:28.431
AND AND WETLANDS FUNDING.

00:59:28.498 --> 00:59:29.999
THAT IS A GOOD QUESTION NO I

00:59:30.066 --> 00:59:31.334
THINK IN THE JANUARY BUDGET

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:32.936
THERE WAS A REAL INTENT AND IT

00:59:33.002 --> 00:59:34.504
GOES TO SOMETHING SAID EARLIER.

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:36.172
TO TRY TO FOCUS MORE DOLLARS ON

00:59:36.239 --> 00:59:37.907
FEWER THINGS AND CHOICES WERE

00:59:37.974 --> 00:59:40.009
MADE AROUND AGAIN THOSE AREAS

00:59:40.076 --> 00:59:40.944
WHERE WE'RE REALLY NOT SEEING

00:59:41.010 --> 00:59:42.245
THE EMISSIONS IT REACTIONS AS

00:59:42.312 --> 00:59:44.013
QUICKLY AS WE NEED TO SEE THEM.

00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:45.381
AND WHERE THOSE THERE'S THOSE

00:59:45.448 --> 00:59:46.349
KIND OF IMMEDIATE POLLUTION

00:59:46.416 --> 00:59:47.083
IMPACTS.

00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:49.585
WHAT DID NOT MAKE IT INTO THE

00:59:49.652 --> 00:59:50.720
JANUARY BUDGET YOU SEE THE MAY

00:59:50.787 --> 00:59:52.622
REVISE REALLY INCREASES THINGS

00:59:52.689 --> 00:59:54.424
THAT WERE IN THE JANUARY BUDGET?

00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:55.925
AND SO IT'S IT'S HARD TO ANSWER

00:59:55.992 --> 00:59:57.393
I SPECIFICALLY FOR ME AT LEAST

00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:58.227
WHAT EXACTLY MADE IT AND IT

00:59:58.294 --> 01:00:04.867
DIDN'T BUT I WILL SAY THERE'S A

01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:07.003
STRONG FOCUS ON JUST.

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:10.106
NARROWING AND I USING DOLLARS IS

01:00:10.173 --> 01:00:12.275
ABOUT PLEASE POSSIBLE -- THE THE

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:13.910

01:00:13.977 --> 01:00:14.510

MORE IN CAP AND TRADE FUNDING

01:00:15.945 --> 01:00:16.412

MOST OF THE LA OWES -- ANALYSIS

01:00:20.984 --> 01:00:22.952
WAS PREDICATED ON A DIFFERENT

THERE'S NO INITIAL METRICS RIGHT

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:18.341

CONFIDENTIAL.

01:01:26.616 --> 01:01:28.351
AND SO I DON'T KNOW ANY OF THAT

01:01:28.418 --> 01:01:29.519
INFORMATION WE GO THROUGH A

01:01:29.585 --> 01:01:31.521

01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:30.939
DETERMINE WHETHER THESE PROGRAMS

01:23:31.005 --> 01:23:32.974
ARE INDEED WORKING DEPENDING ON

01:23:33.041 --> 01:23:33.875
WHETHER THERE ARE CLEAR

01:23:33.942 --> 01:23:35.443
TRANSPARENT METRICS.

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:42.484
AND WHETHER THE FUNDS ARE BEING --

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:44.519
I GET I GUESS I'M I'M NOT SURE

01:23:44.586 --> 01:23:47.389
ON FOR THE TWO TWO YEAR PLAN

01:23:47.455 --> 01:23:48.990
QUESTION.

01:23:49.057 --> 01:23:50.325
OF OR OR OR JUST ON THE TWO

01:23:50.392 --> 01:23:50.992
YEARS OF DOING IT THOUGH AND OUT

01:23:51.059 --> 01:23:52.293
THERE BUT MULTIPLE YEARS SO

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.995
THERE IS SOME SOME STABILITY BUT

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:56.464
THEN WE ACTUALLY DO HOLD THE

01:23:56.531 --> 01:23:58.533
PROGRAMS ACCOUNTABLE THAT IF

01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.834
THEY ARE ACHIEVING THEIR GOALS.

01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:01.169
THAT MAYBE WE DO NEED TO SHIFT

01:24:01.236 --> 01:24:02.837
THE FUNDS THE MORE -- COST

01:24:02.904 --> 01:24:05.039
EFFECTIVE -- ABOUT PROJECTS OR

01:24:05.106 --> 01:24:07.342
PROGRAMS YEAH I MEAN I THINK THE

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:08.877
THE KIND OF CORE OFYOUR

01:24:08.943 --> 01:24:10.512
QUESTION AROUND -- YOU KNOW

01:24:10.578 --> 01:24:12.814
HOLDING PROGRAMS ACCOUNTABLE AND

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:14.215
MAKING SURE THAT WERE THERE WHEN

01:24:14.282 --> 01:24:15.250
WE ALLOCATE THE FUNDS THAT WERE

01:24:15.316 --> 01:24:17.485
REVIEWING IN OF THE PROGRAMS AND

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:18.820
TRYING TO TRACK KIND OF CLEAR

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:20.455
METRICS ON WHAT THOSE PROGRAMS

01:24:20.522 --> 01:24:22.023
ARE ACHIEVING AND THEN -- TAKING

01:24:22.090 --> 01:24:23.324
THAT INTO CONSIDERATION BEFORE

01:24:23.391 --> 01:24:24.092
WE KIND OF ALLOCATE ADDITIONAL

01:24:24.159 --> 01:24:26.194
FUNDS THAT TYPE OF PROCESS

01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:28.029
ABSOLUTELY IS THE TYPE OF

01:24:28.296 --> 01:24:30.932
PROCESS WITH THAT WE SHOULD BE

01:24:30.999 --> 01:24:32.333
SOME REPORTS THAT NHà COME OUT

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:33.401
OF THE ADMINISTRATION HAS KIND

01:24:33.468 --> 01:24:34.869
OF AN ANNUAL REPORT TO COME THAT.

01:24:34.936 --> 01:24:35.970
COMES OUT THAT PROVIDE SOME

01:24:36.037 --> 01:24:38.006
INFORMATION ON METRICS FOR SOME

01:24:38.072 --> 01:24:39.407
OF THESE PROGRAMS BUT A LOT OF

01:24:39.474 --> 01:24:41.576
CASES IT'S IT DOESN'T INCLUDE

01:24:41.643 --> 01:24:42.210
ALL OF THE RELEVANT INFORMATION

01:24:42.277 --> 01:24:44.012
I THINK THAT -- FOR POLICY

01:24:44.078 --> 01:24:45.079
MAKERS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO

01:24:45.146 --> 01:24:46.581
HAVE IN ORDER TO KIND OF BALANCE

01:24:46.648 --> 01:24:47.315
A LOT OF THESE TRADE OFFS

01:24:47.382 --> 01:24:48.283
ASSOCIATE WITH THE DIFFERENT

01:24:48.349 --> 01:24:49.951
PROGRAMS INCLUDING GHGS BUT AS

01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:52.420
AS WELL AS LOCAL AIR POLLUTION

01:24:52.487 --> 01:24:53.054
REDUCTIONS AND OTHER THINGS AND

01:24:53.121 --> 01:24:53.822
SO.

01:24:53.888 --> 01:24:55.323
THEY'RE DOING WHAT YOU CAN -- TO

01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:56.724
YOU PUSH THE ADMINISTRATION TO

01:24:56.791 --> 01:24:57.792
MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THEY'RE

01:24:57.859 --> 01:24:59.360
COMING FORWARD WITH BUT ALLOCATE

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:01.296
WITH ALLOCATIONS AND PROPOSALS

01:25:01.362 --> 01:25:02.130
TO TRY AN OUTLINE WHAT THOSE

01:25:02.197 --> 01:25:04.098
EXPECTED OUTCOMES ARE BEFORE YOU

01:25:04.165 --> 01:25:05.533
ACTUALLY ALLOCATE.

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:06.601
ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND CUT

01:25:06.668 --> 01:25:07.368
KNOWING ABOUT WHAT YOU'VE

01:25:07.435 --> 01:25:09.838
ACHIEVED SO FAR IS IS ABSOLUTELY

01:25:09.904 --> 01:25:12.040
THE RIGHT PROCESS TO FLOW IN IT

01:25:12.106 --> 01:25:14.008
IF THE CHAIRMAN TOLD ME I MEAN

01:25:14.075 --> 01:25:15.977
IN IN TERMS OF RECENTLY PLACE

01:25:16.044 --> 01:25:19.047
INVESTMENT UP UNTIL A LITTLE

01:25:19.113 --> 01:25:21.583
DEMAND -- BRIEF THIS BUT IT LIKE

01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:22.684
FOR EXAMPLE IN IN TERMS OF INTO

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:24.452
THE AGRICULTURE IF YOU'RE IF YOU

01:25:24.519 --> 01:25:25.453
WERE CALLING FOR AGRICULTURE

01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:26.421
CHEN TO MAKE INVESTMENTS BUT

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:27.489
YOU'RE ONLY DOING IT FROM YEAR

01:25:27.555 --> 01:25:30.091
AFTER YEAR AND IT ZEROS OUT OR

01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:31.993
GOES UP YOUR YOUR THEN NO ONE

01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:32.660
CAN PLAN.

01:25:32.727 --> 01:25:34.395
SO IN MY IN MY AT LEAST FROM MY

01:25:34.462 --> 01:25:34.996
PERSPECTIVE IT SEEMS TO MAKE

01:25:35.063 --> 01:25:35.997
MORE SENSE THAT WE PROVIDED TO

01:25:36.064 --> 01:25:38.166
YEAR. THREE YEAR MULTI YEAR --

01:25:38.233 --> 01:25:40.468
PLAN AND THEN IF AND THEN AS IT

01:25:40.535 --> 01:25:48.510
GOES AS AG THEIR GOALS AND THEN

01:25:48.576 --> 01:25:50.512
THE FUNDING GOES DOWN ON RIGHT

01:25:50.578 --> 01:25:51.446
IF THERE'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND

01:25:51.513 --> 01:25:52.714
THEN MAYBE MAKE INVESTMENTS AND

01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:53.081
SOMETHING ELSE.

01:25:53.147 --> 01:25:53.681
YEAH I MEAN I I THINK THERE'S

01:25:53.748 --> 01:25:54.682
THERE'S DEFINITELY SOME BENEFITS

01:25:54.749 --> 01:25:55.283
TO PROVIDING CERTAINTY AROUND

01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:56.351
FUNDING OVER MORE THAN JUST ONE

01:25:56.417 --> 01:25:57.285
YEAR THAT HELPS WITH PLANNING

01:25:57.352 --> 01:25:58.152
FOR BUSINESSES AND THAT ARE

01:25:58.219 --> 01:25:58.920
MAKING KIND OF MORE LONGER TERM

01:25:58.987 --> 01:25:59.721
INVESTMENTS AND BUSINESS

01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:00.522
DECISIONS.

01:26:00.588 --> 01:26:01.756
THERE'S JUST THERE IS JUST THAT

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:02.557
THIS TRADE OFF ON YOU KNOW

01:26:02.624 --> 01:26:03.791
LEGISLATURE'S PRIORITIES MIGHT

01:26:03.858 --> 01:26:05.026
CHANGE A LITTLE BIT FROM ONE

01:26:05.093 --> 01:26:06.494
YEAR TO THE NEXT AND SO YOU'RE

01:43:54.595 --> 01:43:56.530
THAT WILL BE OCCURRING.

01:43:56.597 --> 01:43:57.831
IN FISCAL YEAR.

01:43:57.898 --> 01:44:00.167
TWENTY NINETEEN AVAILABLE TO

01:44:00.233 --> 01:44:00.734
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY

01:44:00.801 --> 01:44:02.102
HAVE.

01:44:02.169 --> 01:44:05.072
THANK YOU ALEJO.

01:44:05.138 --> 01:44:05.706
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE DON'T

01:44:05.772 --> 01:44:07.541
HAVE ANY SPECIFIC CONCERNS WITH

01:44:07.608 --> 01:44:09.409
THIS PARTICULAR PROPOSAL -- I

01:44:09.476 --> 01:44:11.078
DID JUST WANT TO FLAG JUST VERY

01:44:11.144 --> 01:44:12.980
BRIEFLY -- IT RELATES TO REPORT

01:44:13.046 --> 01:44:15.182
THAT -- WE ISSUED LAST MONTH

01:44:15.248 --> 01:44:17.351
WHICH WAS REQUIRED AND AN SRO

01:44:17.417 --> 01:44:18.352
WHICH REQUIRED OUR OFFICE TO

01:44:18.418 --> 01:44:19.219
LOOK AT A COUPLE DIFFERENT

01:44:19.286 --> 01:44:21.021
ASPECTSOF THE LIFELINE PROGRAM

01:44:21.088 --> 01:44:22.356
ONE THEIR BUDGETING AND THE

01:44:22.422 --> 01:44:24.758
METHODS FOR ESTIMATING FUTURE

01:44:24.825 --> 01:44:26.326
PROGRAM COSTS -- AND ON THAT

01:44:26.393 --> 01:44:27.928
ISSUE WE FOUND THAT YOU KNOW IN

01:44:27.995 --> 01:44:28.929
THE PAST THERE BEEN A LOT OF

01:44:28.996 --> 01:44:30.197
CHALLENGES AND ESTIMATING THE

01:44:30.263 --> 01:44:32.032
COST FOR THIS PROGRAM LARGELY

01:44:32.099 --> 01:44:33.033
RELATED TO A SIGNIFICANT.

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:34.601
CHANGE IN THE PROGRAM WHERE THEY

01:44:34.668 --> 01:44:36.703
INCLUDED WIRELESS TO THE PROGRAM

01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:37.771
AND SO THAT ADDED A LOT OF

01:44:37.838 --> 01:44:39.406
UNCERTAINTY RESTAURANTS --

01:44:39.473 --> 01:44:40.707
APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN IMPROVING

01:44:40.774 --> 01:44:42.275
AND QUITE A BIT IN RECENT.

01:44:42.342 --> 01:44:44.111
YEARS -- AND SO WE DON'T HAVE

01:44:44.177 --> 01:44:45.312
ANY CONCERNS WITH THE THE

01:44:45.379 --> 01:44:46.380
ESTIMATES THAT ARE IN THIS

01:44:46.446 --> 01:44:48.181
PARTICULAR PROPOSAL BUT IT'S

01:44:48.248 --> 01:44:49.349
JUST ONE OF FLAG OUT FOR YOU

01:44:49.416 --> 01:44:50.050
THERE IS SOME BUDGET BILL

01:44:50.117 --> 01:44:51.585
LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT WOULD

01:44:51.652 --> 01:44:53.620
GIVE THEM SOME FLEXIBILITY -- IF

01:44:53.687 --> 01:44:55.188
COSTS GO HIGHER THAN WHAT

01:44:55.255 --> 01:44:57.357
THEY'RE ESTIMATING HERE -- WE

01:44:57.424 --> 01:44:58.692
ALSO IN IN THAT REPORT KIND OF

01:44:58.759 --> 01:44:59.760
THE INCLUDED AN OPTION THE

01:44:59.826 --> 01:45:01.028
LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANNA CONSIDER

01:45:01.094 --> 01:45:02.262
ADDING SOME SORT CAP TO THAT

01:45:02.329 --> 01:45:03.530
THAT FLEXIBILITY BUT WE DO THINK

01:45:03.597 --> 01:45:05.198
SOME FLEXIBILITY AS IS

01:45:05.265 --> 01:45:06.066
REASONABLE.

01:45:06.133 --> 01:45:09.069
THE SECOND ISSUE WAS RELATED TO

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:10.871
THE ENROLLMENT IN THE PROGRAM --

01:45:10.937 --> 01:45:11.938
SOME CONCERNS I THINK AROUND

01:45:12.005 --> 01:45:13.540
KIND OF THE ENROLLMENT RATE JUST

01:45:13.607 --> 01:45:15.809
FOR CONTEXT THERE'S ABOUT ABOUT

01:45:15.876 --> 01:45:16.977
FORTY THE ESTIMATE IS ABOUT 40%

01:45:17.044 --> 01:45:18.845
OF THE ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS ARE

01:45:18.912 --> 01:45:20.614
ACTUALLY ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM.

01:45:20.681 --> 01:45:22.916
AND SO WE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE

01:45:22.983 --> 01:45:24.985
POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS FOR WHY

01:45:25.052 --> 01:45:25.919
THAT MIGHT BE THE CASE AND THE

01:45:25.986 --> 01:45:26.987
OTHERS A FEW DIFFERENT

01:45:27.054 --> 01:45:28.822
CATEGORIES ONE IS JUST GENERAL

01:45:28.889 --> 01:45:30.724
AWARENESS OF THE PROGRAM SO --

01:45:30.791 --> 01:45:32.659
HOUSEHOLD MIGHT NOT BE BE AWARE

01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:35.062
THAT THE PROGRAM EVEN EXISTS --

01:45:35.128 --> 01:45:36.763
TO EVEN IF THEY ARE AWARE IT

01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:38.165
MIGHT BE JUST A MATTER OF AND

01:45:38.231 --> 01:45:39.599
THEY PREFER ANOTHER PLANNER

01:45:39.666 --> 01:45:40.901
CARRIER TO THE ONES THAT ARE

01:45:40.967 --> 01:45:42.536
BEING OFFERED HERE AND THEN

01:45:42.602 --> 01:45:44.938
THIRD -- IT COULD JUST BE IS

01:45:45.005 --> 01:45:45.972
SIMPLY A MATTER OF IT IT'S

01:45:46.039 --> 01:45:47.874
DIFFICULT TO AND OR RENEW IN THE

01:45:47.941 --> 01:45:50.410
PROCESS AND SO -- WELL ALL THOSE

01:45:50.477 --> 01:45:51.278
IT COULD BE POTENTIALLY

01:45:51.344 --> 01:45:55.048
CONTRIBUTING FACTORS TO THE

01:45:55.115 --> 01:45:55.982
CURRENT ENROLLMENT RATE -- IT'S

01:45:56.049 --> 01:45:57.150
NOT QUITE CLEAR WHICH ONES OF

01:45:57.217 --> 01:45:57.918
THOSE ARE KIND OF THE MAJOR

01:45:57.984 --> 01:45:59.686
FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO IT AND

01:45:59.753 --> 01:46:01.088
SO OUR RECOMMENDATION WAS TO

01:46:01.154 --> 01:46:02.089
DIRECT THE PC.

01:46:02.155 --> 01:46:07.461
TO CONDUCT AN EVALUATION OF THAT

01:46:07.527 --> 01:46:08.929
IT LIKELY IN THE FORM OF THE

01:46:08.995 --> 01:46:09.896
SURVEY OF ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS TO

01:46:09.963 --> 01:46:10.564
GET A SENSE OF WHAT WHICH ONE OF

01:46:10.630 --> 01:46:11.198
THESE FACTORS IS REALLY KIND OF

01:46:11.264 --> 01:46:12.065
THE PRIMARY.

01:46:12.132 --> 01:46:12.799
DRIVER -- FOR THE CURRENT

01:46:12.866 --> 01:46:14.000
ENROLLMENT RATES AND SO -- AS IT

01:46:14.067 --> 01:46:14.568
RELATES TO THIS PARTICULAR

01:46:14.634 --> 01:46:16.002
PROPOSAL IT DOES INCLUDE THE

01:46:16.069 --> 01:46:18.071
ESTIMATED FUNDING FOR A PILOT --

01:46:18.138 --> 01:46:20.507
THAT THE COMMISSION RECENTLY

01:46:20.574 --> 01:46:22.609
ADOPTED WHICH TRIES TO ADDRESS

01:46:22.676 --> 01:46:23.744
SOME OF THESE ISSUES ARE

01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:25.212
BRINGING ON YOUR PROVIDING

01:46:25.278 --> 01:46:27.180
SUBSIDIES TO A NEW KERRIER THAT

01:46:27.247 --> 01:46:29.015
MIGHT BE -- KIND OF BETTER KNOWN

01:46:29.082 --> 01:46:30.617
AMONG SOME OF THE POPULATIONS

01:46:30.684 --> 01:46:32.886
AND INCLUDING SOME ADDITIONAL

01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:34.187
NEW KIND OF ELIGIBILITY

01:46:34.254 --> 01:46:35.756
ENROLLMENT PROCESS HE'S FOR

01:46:35.822 --> 01:46:38.191
CERTAIN -- HOUSEHOLDS AND SO

01:46:38.258 --> 01:46:39.192
THERE IS SOME MONEY IN THAT FOR

01:46:39.259 --> 01:46:41.528
THIS -- AND THE PC HAS AN

01:46:41.595 --> 01:46:43.363
ONGOING PROCEEDING WHERE THERE

01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.897
ARE VALUE AND SOME OTHER

01:46:43.964 --> 01:46:48.068
POTENTIAL PILOT PROGRAMS TO TRY

01:46:48.135 --> 01:46:48.668
TO INCREASE ENROLLMENT IN THE

01:46:48.735 --> 01:46:51.338
PROGRAM.

01:46:51.404 --> 01:46:53.440
YES HOW ARE YOU GOOD MORNING

01:46:53.507 --> 01:46:56.977
MISTER HARRISON.

01:46:57.043 --> 01:46:57.544
OF FOUR HUNDRED AND SOME ODD

01:46:57.611 --> 01:46:58.812
MILLION [inaudible]

01:46:58.879 --> 01:47:01.748
OPERATING FROM.

01:47:01.815 --> 01:47:05.452
FEES ON OTHER USERS CORRECT.

01:47:05.519 --> 01:47:06.720
THIS IS NOT A GENERAL FUND THIS

01:47:06.787 --> 01:47:10.323
IS A FEE THAT IS.

01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:10.857
TAKEN FROM.

01:47:10.924 --> 01:47:12.859
OTHER.

01:47:12.926 --> 01:47:15.729
PEOPLE ON A RECURRING BASIS

01:47:15.796 --> 01:47:17.430
CORRECT ANOTHER TELEPHONE THOSE

01:47:17.497 --> 01:47:20.834
YES YEAH THAT'S RIGHT -- IS A

01:47:20.901 --> 01:47:22.269
100% OF THIS FOUR HUNDRED AND

01:47:22.335 --> 01:47:23.937
SOME ODD MILLION.

01:47:24.004 --> 01:47:27.374
GOING TO THE SUBSIDIES NECESSARY

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:30.944
TO GET THESE INDIVIDUALS THE RIP

01:47:31.011 --> 01:47:33.246
RELIEF.

01:47:33.313 --> 01:47:35.615
OR ARE THEY ARE THIRD PARTY.

01:47:35.682 --> 01:47:36.950
PARTICIPANTS IN THIS THAT ARE

01:47:37.017 --> 01:47:41.755
GETTING SOME OF THIS MONEY -- SO

01:47:41.822 --> 01:47:43.523
THERE'S A PORTION OF THE MONEY

01:47:43.590 --> 01:47:44.925
THAT GOES TO A THIRD PARTY

01:47:44.991 --> 01:47:46.560
ADMINISTRATOR THAT HELPS

01:47:46.626 --> 01:47:48.295
ADMINISTER THE ELIGIBILITY AND

01:47:48.361 --> 01:47:50.630
ENROLLMENT PROCESS -- THE WAY

01:47:50.697 --> 01:47:52.032
THE PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED IS

01:47:52.098 --> 01:47:53.200
THAT THE SUBSIDIES ARE PROVIDED

01:47:53.266 --> 01:47:55.902
TO THE CARRIERS THEMSELVES.

01:47:55.969 --> 01:47:57.337
WHICH THEN -- KIND OF DETERMINE

01:47:57.404 --> 01:48:00.273
THE STRUCTURE OF THE SERVICE

01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:01.875
THAT THEY OFFER BUT THERE'S SORT

01:48:01.942 --> 01:48:03.243
OF A FLAT SUBSIDY THAT GOES TO

01:48:03.310 --> 01:48:06.913
THE CARRIERS -- THAT DEPENDS ON

01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:07.747
THE NUMBER OF THE AND OUT HOW

01:48:07.814 --> 01:48:08.381
HELD OUT A ROLE OR HUNDRED AND

01:48:08.448 --> 01:48:10.417
SOME ODD MILLION HOW MUCH OF

01:48:10.483 --> 01:48:10.984
THAT.

01:48:11.051 --> 01:48:11.985
ACTUALLY GETS TO THE PEOPLE WHO

01:48:12.052 --> 01:48:15.522
NEED IT. THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:48:15.589 --> 01:48:18.124
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY ALMOST ALL

01:48:18.191 --> 01:48:25.131
OF IT BUT I MEAN I THINK IT'S

01:48:25.198 --> 01:48:26.700
IT'S STILL BE YOU SEE NOW.

01:48:26.766 --> 01:48:29.703
SO DOES STATE OPERATIONS ARE AT

01:48:29.769 --> 01:48:30.670
TWENTY SEVEN MILLION AND THAT

01:48:30.737 --> 01:48:32.038
INCLUDES TO THE THIRD PARTY

01:48:32.105 --> 01:48:34.741
ADMINISTRATOR -- AND THEN I

01:48:34.808 --> 01:48:35.342
THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:48:35.408 --> 01:48:37.544
DIFFICULT TO ANSWER ON THE KIND

01:48:37.611 --> 01:48:38.678
OF THE SUBSIDIES THAT ARE

01:48:38.745 --> 01:48:39.813
PROVIDED TO THE CARRIERS TO THEN

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:41.915
PROVIDE -- THE SUBSIDIZED PHONE

01:48:41.982 --> 01:48:43.383
SERVICE BECAUSE THE SUBSIDY GOES

01:48:43.450 --> 01:48:45.886
TO THE KERRIER -- AND THEN THAT

01:48:45.952 --> 01:48:47.420
THEY KIND OF DETERMINE YOU KNOW

01:48:47.487 --> 01:48:48.922
WHAT WHAT EXACTLY THE SERVICES

01:48:48.989 --> 01:48:50.423
THAT'S OFFERED TO THE TO THE

01:48:50.490 --> 01:48:51.224
CUSTOMERS OF THE CUSTOMERS

01:48:51.291 --> 01:48:51.925
GETTING.

01:48:51.992 --> 01:48:53.260
SOME BENEFIT BUT IT'S DIFFICULT

01:48:53.326 --> 01:48:55.295
TO KIND OF QUANTIFY THE THE

01:48:55.362 --> 01:48:57.097
EXACT DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THAT

01:48:57.163 --> 01:48:57.464
OKAY [inaudible]

01:48:57.530 --> 01:48:58.832
ANY OTHER.

01:48:58.899 --> 01:49:00.700
JUST TO CLARIFY THAT WE DO

01:49:00.767 --> 01:49:02.836
REVIEW AND APPROVE THE PLANS.

01:49:02.903 --> 01:49:04.304
AND WE MAKE SURE THAT THE PLANS.

01:49:04.371 --> 01:49:06.373
ARE -- DISCOUNTS OFF RETAIL

01:49:06.439 --> 01:49:07.908
PLANS ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE IN

01:49:07.974 --> 01:49:08.875
THE MARKETPLACE.

01:49:08.942 --> 01:49:10.176
SO WE DO BELIEVE THAT THE

01:49:10.243 --> 01:49:11.711
MAJORITY OF THE SUBSIDIES FORM

01:49:11.778 --> 01:49:13.246
DIRECTLY TO THE CONSUMERS AND OF

01:49:13.313 --> 01:49:14.748
THE FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR

01:49:14.814 --> 01:49:16.516
MILLION DOLLARS FOUR HUNDRED AND

01:49:16.583 --> 01:49:17.817
TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS ARE

01:49:17.884 --> 01:49:18.852
FOR SUBSIDY PAYMENTS TO

01:49:18.919 --> 01:49:19.452
CONSUMERS.

01:49:19.519 --> 01:49:21.288
AS THE HELLO POINTS OUT THEY DO

01:49:21.354 --> 01:49:22.022
GO.

01:49:22.088 --> 01:49:23.657
THE KEIRSEY COMPENSATION AFTER

01:49:23.723 --> 01:49:25.025
THEY OFFER THE DISCOUNTED

01:49:25.091 --> 01:49:27.861
SERVICE TO CONSUMERS AND IS THAT

01:49:27.928 --> 01:49:28.695
SOUGHT COMPENSATION.

01:49:28.762 --> 01:49:30.830
CONNECTED TO THE ENROLLMENT YES

01:49:30.897 --> 01:49:32.032
THAT THIS IS DIRECTLY BASED UPON

01:49:32.098 --> 01:49:33.600
THE ROMAN YOU OUT OF THE FOUR

01:49:33.667 --> 01:49:36.636
HUNDRED AND SOME ODD.

01:49:36.703 --> 01:49:39.439
THAT MONEY IS GOING TO ENROLLEES

01:49:39.506 --> 01:49:41.007
AND ROBERTS THAT'S CORRECT YES

01:49:41.074 --> 01:49:46.546
THANK YOU -- I THINK MS REVERSE

01:49:46.613 --> 01:49:51.785
YOUR FIRST IN THIS RACE.

01:49:51.851 --> 01:49:53.720
I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT THIS

01:49:53.787 --> 01:49:55.121
PROGRAM HAS VERY LOW IN MORE

01:49:55.188 --> 01:49:57.090
THAN ROLL MAN YOU KNOW 40%.

01:49:57.157 --> 01:49:58.158
OF YOU KNOW I REPRESENT A

01:49:58.224 --> 01:49:59.693
COMMUNITY THAT WOULD BENEFIT

01:49:59.759 --> 01:50:01.361
FROM THE SERVICE THAT REALLY

01:50:01.428 --> 01:50:02.495
NEEDS IT.

01:50:02.562 --> 01:50:04.564
AND PROBABLY THERE'S NO OUT

01:50:04.631 --> 01:50:07.500
REACH THEIR TWIN ROLE ANYBODY IN

01:50:07.567 --> 01:50:08.935
THIS PROGRAM -- YOU KNOW IT'S AN

01:50:09.002 --> 01:50:10.770
IMPORTANT PROGRAM AND I REALLY

01:50:10.837 --> 01:50:13.707
BELIEVE IN THAT -- BUT YOU KNOW

01:50:13.773 --> 01:50:15.809
DO YOU HAVE AN ENROLLMENT GOAL

01:50:15.875 --> 01:50:18.278
AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS YEAR

01:50:18.345 --> 01:50:20.413
TO GET THEIR SURE SO THERE'S

YEARS AT LEAST SINCE I'VE BEEN

02:18:58.930 --> 02:19:01.433
HERE -- OUR APPROACH HAS BEEN

02:19:01.499 --> 02:19:03.968
MORE REACTIVE THAN PROACTIVE --

02:19:04.035 --> 02:19:05.270
WHEN IT CAME TO THE HELICOPTERS

02:19:05.336 --> 02:19:06.871
WE HAD TO REPLACE THAT SLEEP

SORT OF BEEN OFFERED -- A TO US

02:19:25.323 --> 02:19:27.826

CURRENTLY AND IN THE FUTURE IS

02:19:46.611 --> 02:19:49.247
THE NEW NORMAL -- AND YET I

02:19:49.314 --> 02:19:52.584
DON'T THINK WE HAVE -- TAKEN A

02:19:52.650 --> 02:19:55.587
COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT WHAT THE

02:19:55.653 --> 02:19:57.021
FIREFIGHTING GUY AIR FLEET OF

THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE.

02:19:59.457 --> 02:20:00.925
AND I THINK WE NEED TO BEGIN

02:20:00.992 --> 02:20:02.994
DOING THAT I THINK ONE OF THE

02:20:03.061 --> 02:20:03.828
THINGS WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IS

02:20:03.895 --> 02:20:07.966
WHETHER -- WE SHOULD BE FINDING

02:20:08.032 --> 02:20:09.701
A WAY TO DEVELOP AIRCRAFT THAT

SPECIFICALLY FOR FIRE FIGHTING

02:20:14.239 --> 02:20:16.441
PURPOSES IF THIS IS OUR NEW

02:20:16.508 --> 02:20:20.178
NORMAL AND IT CERTAINLY -- IS --

02:20:20.245 --> 02:20:23.181
THEN SHOULD OUR FLEET NOT --

02:20:23.248 --> 02:20:24.749
REFLECT THAT IN OUR THEIR COST

02:20:24.816 --> 02:20:27.552
EFFICIENCIES THAT -- KAMEL ALONG

02:20:27.619 --> 02:20:29.654
WITH THAT -- I DON'T THINK WE'RE

02:20:29.721 --> 02:20:30.588
IN A POSITION TO ANSWER THOSE

02:20:30.655 --> 02:20:32.056
QUESTIONS BUT WE SHOULD PUT

02:20:32.123 --> 02:20:33.725
OURSELVES IN A POSITION TO

02:20:33.792 --> 02:20:34.626
ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS SO THAT

02:20:34.692 --> 02:20:37.896
WE CAN THEN -- BEGIN ALLOCATING

02:20:37.962 --> 02:20:42.734
FUNDS -- TO AT ACHIEVE -- BOTH A

02:20:42.801 --> 02:20:43.234
MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE

02:20:43.301 --> 02:20:51.943
EFFICIENT -- TO ERR -- ERR FLEET --

02:20:52.010 --> 02:20:53.244
AND WITH THAT WENT AWAY -- MOVE

02:20:53.311 --> 02:20:57.015
ON TO ISSUE -- TEN THE FARMERS

02:20:57.081 --> 02:21:05.356

PUT OUT A CALL FOR IDEAS THEY'VE

02:30:27.885 --> 02:30:29.286
RECEIVED THOSE BACK.

02:30:29.353 --> 02:30:31.389
ON IN EVALUATING THIS OUR QUEST

02:30:31.455 --> 02:30:33.057
I'M OUR OFFICE IN YOUR STAFF HAD

02:30:33.124 --> 02:30:34.358
ASKED THE DEPARTMENT FOR

02:30:34.425 --> 02:30:36.727
INFORMATION ON WHAT WHAT THE

02:30:36.794 --> 02:30:38.696
STATUS OF THE PROCUREMENT IS HOW

02:30:38.763 --> 02:30:39.263
MANY.

02:30:39.330 --> 02:30:40.831
ON INNOVATORS OUR IDEAS HAVE

02:30:40.898 --> 02:30:43.000
COME FORWARD WHAT THE SCOPE OF

02:30:43.067 --> 02:30:44.802
THOSE IS WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE

02:30:44.869 --> 02:30:49.607
THE TYPES OF SOLUTIONS THE

02:30:49.673 --> 02:30:51.642
POTENTIAL BECAUSE I'M AND

02:30:51.709 --> 02:30:52.276
UNFORTUNATELY THE MINISTRATION

02:30:52.343 --> 02:30:52.843
IS NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE ANY

02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:53.544
INFORMATION ON THAT AND THEY ARE

02:30:53.611 --> 02:30:54.712
UNDER CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS.

02:30:54.779 --> 02:30:55.646
BEING THAT THEY ARE MIDWAY

02:30:55.713 --> 02:30:57.181
THROUGH THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS

02:30:57.248 --> 02:30:58.783
AND SO BUT THE LEGISLATURE IN A

02:30:58.849 --> 02:31:00.418
DIFFICULT POSITION OF NOT REALLY

02:31:00.484 --> 02:31:01.652
KNOWING WHAT YOU'RE BUYING FOR

02:31:01.719 --> 02:31:03.454
THIS FIFTEEN MILLION OR FIFTEEN

02:31:03.521 --> 02:31:04.688
MILLION PLUS.

02:31:04.755 --> 02:31:06.390
IN FUNDING SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND

02:31:06.457 --> 02:31:07.658
IF YOU DO WANT TO GO FORWARD

02:31:07.725 --> 02:31:09.927
WITH THIS RECOGNIZING THERE

02:31:09.994 --> 02:31:11.796
COULD BE SOME BENEFITS -- IT TO

02:31:11.862 --> 02:31:13.798
MODIFY THE PROPOSED PROVISIONAL

02:31:13.864 --> 02:31:15.933
LANGUAGE TO FIRST PUT A CAP ON

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:17.368
THE TOTAL LEVEL OFFENDING SO YOU

02:31:17.435 --> 02:31:19.270
HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT YOUR YOUR

02:31:19.336 --> 02:31:21.639
TOTAL COMMITMENT IS -- FROM THE

02:31:21.705 --> 02:31:24.074
GENERAL FUND AND SECOND REQUIRE

02:31:24.141 --> 02:31:25.776
THAT ALL NOTIFICATIONS THROUGH

02:31:25.843 --> 02:31:27.211
THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET

02:31:27.278 --> 02:31:28.179
COMMITTEE FOR THOSE MAJOR

02:31:28.245 --> 02:31:29.246
CHANGES BE THIRTY DAY

02:31:29.313 --> 02:31:31.682
NOTIFICATIONS IN SOME CASES THE

02:31:31.749 --> 02:31:33.284
EGGS THE LANGUAGE PROPOSED.

02:31:33.350 --> 02:31:35.019
BY THE ADMINISTRATION IS A

02:31:35.085 --> 02:31:36.587
FIFTEEN DAY NOTIFICATION WHICH

02:31:36.654 --> 02:31:37.855
REALLY JUST DOES NOT PROVIDE

02:31:37.922 --> 02:31:40.391
SUFFICIENT TIME FOR THE

02:31:40.458 --> 02:31:42.159
LEGISLATURE TO REVIEW --

02:31:42.226 --> 02:31:43.360
POTENTIAL FUNDING INCREASES I

02:31:43.427 --> 02:31:47.932
WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THAT AND

02:31:47.998 --> 02:31:50.601
CAO FIGHTER PROVIDE AN UPDATE TO

02:31:50.668 --> 02:31:51.602
THE LEGISLATURE.

02:31:51.669 --> 02:31:52.670
AND THROUGH THE JOINT

02:31:52.736 --> 02:31:54.438
LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE --

02:31:54.505 --> 02:31:56.307
ONCE THEY'RE PAST THIS INITIAL

02:31:56.373 --> 02:31:58.142
REVIEW PERIOD AND TO GIVE A

02:31:58.209 --> 02:31:59.643
SENSE BEFORE THEY START

02:31:59.710 --> 02:32:01.612
COMMITTING FINDS AS HOW MANY

02:32:01.679 --> 02:32:02.646
PROPOSALS DID THEY GET WHAT WERE

02:32:02.713 --> 02:32:04.081
THEY TYPES SOME OF THOSE

02:32:04.148 --> 02:32:05.850
QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW

02:32:05.916 --> 02:32:07.751
THAT THERE ENABLE TO ANSWER.

02:32:07.818 --> 02:32:09.420
I'M AND THEN FOURTH AND TO

02:32:09.487 --> 02:32:10.721
REQUIRE CAL FAIR TO PROVIDE A

02:32:10.788 --> 02:32:12.523
DESCRIPTION AT THE OUTCOMES OF

02:32:12.590 --> 02:32:14.058
ANY FIELD TESTING TO REALLY JUST

02:32:14.124 --> 02:32:15.259
GIVE MORE INFORMATION TO THE

02:32:15.326 --> 02:32:17.628
LEGISLATURE TO BRING YOU ALL

02:32:17.695 --> 02:32:17.862
ALONG.

02:32:17.928 --> 02:32:18.963
AND AS THIS GOES THROUGH THE

02:32:19.029 --> 02:32:21.031
PROCESS AND RATHER THAN AN

02:32:21.098 --> 02:32:26.470
UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT

02:32:26.537 --> 02:32:28.339
YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT IT'S

02:32:28.405 --> 02:32:30.307
FOR THANK YOU FOR FINANCE

02:32:30.374 --> 02:32:31.742
CHURCHES WANT TO KNOW THAT THEY

02:32:31.809 --> 02:32:32.910
HAD THE GOVERNOR ISSUED

02:32:32.977 --> 02:32:34.545
EXECUTIVE ORDER AND FOR NINETEEN

02:32:34.612 --> 02:32:35.379
AND INITIATED THE INNOVATION

02:32:35.446 --> 02:32:36.614
PROCUREMENT SPRINT REALLY WITH

02:32:36.680 --> 02:32:37.248
THE INTENT.

02:32:37.314 --> 02:32:37.882
OF ADDRESSING AND THAT SORT OF

02:32:37.948 --> 02:32:38.816
SEVERE WILDFIRE CONDITIONS THE

02:32:38.883 --> 02:32:40.050
STATE IS FACING AND THE ENTIRE

02:32:40.117 --> 02:32:41.485
GOAL OF THE INNOVATION

02:32:41.552 --> 02:32:42.887
PROCUREMENT SPRINT AND THIS

02:32:42.953 --> 02:32:44.188
PROCESS IS TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN

02:32:44.255 --> 02:32:45.356
THE STATE CAN DEPLOY THE

02:32:45.422 --> 02:32:47.258
WILDFIRE SOLUTIONS AS QUICKLY AS

02:32:47.324 --> 02:32:49.026
POSSIBLE -- AND SO WE'RE SORT OF

02:32:49.093 --> 02:32:50.261
NOT OPERATING UNDER NORMAL

02:32:50.327 --> 02:32:51.795
CONDITIONS WERE OPERATING UNDER

02:32:51.862 --> 02:32:53.297
VERY ABNORMAL CONDITIONS IN THE

02:32:53.364 --> 02:32:54.732
SENSE THAT WE HAVE SORT OF A NEW

02:32:54.798 --> 02:32:56.500
NORMAL RELATED TO THAT SORT OF

02:32:56.567 --> 02:32:58.269
SEVERE -- AND INCREASED WILDFIRE

02:32:58.335 --> 02:32:59.737
ACTIVITY THE NUMBER OF WILDFIRES

02:32:59.803 --> 02:33:01.138
EXCITE ARRESTED THE ENTIRE

02:33:01.205 --> 02:33:03.007
PROCESS IS AGAIN JUST DESIGNED

02:33:03.073 --> 02:33:04.108
AROUND ENSURING THAT WE CAN GET

02:33:04.174 --> 02:33:05.876
THE TECHNOLOGY ON THE GROUND AS

02:33:05.943 --> 02:33:07.011
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

02:33:07.077 --> 02:33:10.581
AND AND AND ANY SORT OF I

02:33:10.648 --> 02:33:11.515
CHANGES TO THE BUDGET BILL

02:33:11.582 --> 02:33:12.850
LANGUAGE REALLY HAS THE

02:33:12.917 --> 02:33:14.485
POTENTIAL TO CREATE DELAY IS

02:33:14.552 --> 02:33:16.120
THAT THE TIME LINES ARE

02:33:16.186 --> 02:33:17.154
STRUCTURED SO THAT THAT THAT

02:33:17.221 --> 02:33:18.022
SORT OF FIVE FIVE MILLION

02:33:18.088 --> 02:33:19.256
DOLLARS THAT ALLOCATED FOR THE

02:33:19.323 --> 02:33:20.457
PROOF OF CONCEPT PHASE WHICH

02:33:20.524 --> 02:33:21.792
AGAIN WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR THAT.

02:33:21.859 --> 02:33:23.060
TO BE ABLE TO SPEND WITHIN THE

02:33:23.127 --> 02:33:24.161
FIVE MILLION ANY.

02:33:24.228 --> 02:33:25.462
EXPENDITURES ABOUT THAT WE WOULD

02:33:25.529 --> 02:33:26.330
HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE

02:33:26.397 --> 02:33:27.998
NOTIFICATION PROCESS AND THE

02:33:28.065 --> 02:33:29.967
JAIL BC PROCESS AND WE WANT IT

02:33:30.034 --> 02:33:32.369
DEPLOYED THOSE SOLUTIONS THIS

02:33:32.436 --> 02:33:34.305
SUMMER AND SO THAT.

02:33:34.371 --> 02:33:36.540
AND COMING BACK I'M SORT OF AND

02:33:36.607 --> 02:33:37.708
ANY SORT OF ADDITIONAL

02:33:37.775 --> 02:33:38.275
REQUIREMENTS THERE IN WOULD

02:33:38.342 --> 02:33:40.044
DELAYED THE ABILITY TO DO THAT

02:33:40.110 --> 02:33:42.479
AND THEN I GET A TIME LINE FOR

02:33:42.546 --> 02:33:44.048
THAT AND THE EYES SORT OF

02:33:44.114 --> 02:33:45.349
PROCUREMENTS OR FACE TO OF THE

02:33:45.416 --> 02:33:46.183
PROCESS WHICH AGAIN.

02:33:46.250 --> 02:33:47.651
AND THE DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY

02:33:47.718 --> 02:33:48.986
CAN SPEAK TOO MUCH MORE

02:33:49.053 --> 02:33:51.021
ELOQUENTLY THAN MYSELF AND THAT

02:33:51.088 --> 02:33:52.590
IS ALL STRUCTURED AGAIN ON THE

02:33:52.656 --> 02:33:54.758
BASIS OF BEING ABLE TO UTILIZE

02:33:54.825 --> 02:33:55.559
THE RESULTS FROM THE FIELD

02:33:55.626 --> 02:33:55.826
TESTING.

02:33:55.893 --> 02:33:57.795
AND THEN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE

02:33:57.861 --> 02:33:59.163
ENSURE THAT WE CAN DEPLOY THAT

02:33:59.229 --> 02:34:01.265
TECHNOLOGY THAT'S PROCURED -- IN

02:34:01.332 --> 02:34:02.967
TIME FOR THAT FIGHT WILDFIRE

02:34:03.033 --> 02:34:04.835
SEASON IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX AND

02:34:04.902 --> 02:34:06.270
AND THE INTENT AND GOAL IS TO

02:34:06.337 --> 02:34:07.471
BRING FORWARD INFORMATION

02:34:07.538 --> 02:34:09.340
CONSISTENT WITH LIMITATIONS OF

02:34:09.406 --> 02:34:10.841
THE PROCESS ITSELF BUT TO BE AS

02:34:10.908 --> 02:34:12.876
TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE -- AND

02:34:12.943 --> 02:34:14.411
ALSO NOTE THAT ANY ON GOING

02:34:14.478 --> 02:34:15.879
FUNDING COMMITMENTS -- WOULD

02:34:15.946 --> 02:34:16.547
HAVE TO COME BEFORE THE

02:34:16.614 --> 02:34:18.048
LEGISLATURE SO THIS IS REALLY A

02:34:18.115 --> 02:34:19.183
ONE TIME FUNDING TO INITIATE

02:34:19.249 --> 02:34:20.784
THIS PROCESS THE OUTCOMES OF

02:34:20.851 --> 02:34:22.152
THAT PROCESS WILL ULTIMATELY BE

02:34:22.219 --> 02:34:29.793
BROUGHT FOR TO THE LEGISLATURE

02:34:29.860 --> 02:34:30.127
IN THE FUTURE.

02:34:30.194 --> 02:34:32.062
WELL WHETHER IT'S SO ONE TIME OR

02:34:32.129 --> 02:34:32.463
ONGOING WE HAVE A

02:34:32.529 --> 02:34:32.997
CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED

02:34:33.063 --> 02:34:33.964
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE

02:34:34.031 --> 02:34:36.567
OVERSIGHT AND AS THE STAFFORD

02:34:36.634 --> 02:34:38.869
PORT TO WE HAVE A ONE CENT.

02:34:38.936 --> 02:34:39.803
SAYS STAFF COMMENT THIS

02:34:39.870 --> 02:34:41.205
PROCUREMENT PROCESS IS UNUSUAL

02:34:41.271 --> 02:34:41.872
AND MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT READ

02:34:41.939 --> 02:34:44.174
IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE.

02:34:44.241 --> 02:34:47.311
TO EVALUATE ITS MERITS -- AND I

02:34:47.378 --> 02:34:49.647
UNDERSTAND THE INTENT HERE I

02:34:49.713 --> 02:34:51.115
APPROVE OF THE END.

02:34:51.181 --> 02:34:54.451
OF THE INTENT IT'S CLEARLY VERY

02:34:54.518 --> 02:34:56.020
IMPORTANT.

02:34:56.086 --> 02:34:56.820
YOU MENTIONED -- THIS IS

02:34:56.887 --> 02:34:58.222
ABNORMAL AND MORE IN THE NEW

02:34:58.288 --> 02:35:01.091
NORMAL THE WE'RE GONNA PROBABLY

02:35:01.158 --> 02:35:02.693
GET TO A POINT WHERE WE START TO

02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:03.927
ABUSE THOSE TERMS.

02:35:03.994 --> 02:35:07.998
BUT IN THIS NEW NORMAL WE HAVE

02:35:08.065 --> 02:35:10.067
TO FIND A WAY TO BOTH

02:35:10.134 --> 02:35:11.435
ACCOMMODATE THE NEED TO MOVE

02:35:11.502 --> 02:35:14.071
QUICKLY ON PROJECTS LIKE THIS.

02:35:14.138 --> 02:35:17.007
AND RESPECT THE ROLE OF THE

02:35:17.074 --> 02:35:18.375
ADMINISTRATION AND THE

02:35:18.442 --> 02:35:20.511
LEGISLATURE IN OVERSEEING BUDGET

02:35:20.577 --> 02:35:21.378
ITEMS LIKE THIS.

02:35:21.445 --> 02:35:23.514
SO THIS IS KIND OF A GOOD TEST

02:35:23.580 --> 02:35:25.716
CASE -- AND I THINK THE ALEJO

02:35:25.783 --> 02:35:28.452
HAS A PROPOSED SOME GOOD IDEAS

02:35:28.519 --> 02:35:29.019
ABOUT WHAT WE WANT TO THINK

02:35:29.086 --> 02:35:33.057
ABOUT -- IN IN THE FUTURE -- SO

02:35:33.123 --> 02:35:35.959
THAT WERE ABLE TO FULFILL ALL OF

02:35:36.026 --> 02:35:37.961
ALL OF THE ALL ALL OF OUR

02:35:38.028 --> 02:35:38.662
FUNCTIONS.

02:35:38.729 --> 02:35:41.699
AND TO DO APPROPRIATELY AND

02:35:41.765 --> 02:35:43.834
WHILE.

MENTIONED WHEN I READ THIS I WAS

02:35:50.441 --> 02:35:51.375
IT'S EXCITING TO SEE THAT WE'RE

THAT WE ARE LIVING AND TAKING

02:35:54.912 --> 02:35:56.780
THIS REALITY SERIOUSLY -- BUT I

02:35:56.847 --> 02:35:57.781
THINK WE NEED TO DO IT IN A

02:35:57.848 --> 02:35:59.983
RESPONSIBLE MANNER THAT THIS AND

02:36:00.050 --> 02:36:02.152

OR INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES PRIOR

02:59:58.587 --> 02:59:59.722
TO THEM BEING DEPLOYED.

02:59:59.788 --> 03:00:00.756
SO WE WANT TO BASICALLY MAKE

THEM.

03:00:08.097 --> 03:00:09.532
IN THE PAST RITUALLY ALL OF THE

03:00:09.598 --> 03:00:10.900
EQUIPMENT THAT WE CERTIFIED

03:00:10.966 --> 03:00:12.368
THEIR COMBUSTION ENGINES SO

03:00:12.434 --> 03:00:13.669
WHETHER THEY'RE IN CARS OR

03:00:15.804 --> 03:00:16.272
ENGINES.

03:00:16.338 --> 03:00:19.542
BUT TECHNOLOGY AND OUR PROGRAMS

03:00:19.608 --> 03:00:21.477
HAVE SHIFTED -- TO HAVE A

03:00:21.544 --> 03:00:22.545
GREATER INTEREST AND

ESTABLISHED APPROVAL PROCEDURES

03:00:32.388 --> 03:00:34.190
FOR THESE TYPES OF EQUIPMENT AND

03:00:34.256 --> 03:00:35.925
THIS VCP BASICALLY PROVIDES THE

03:00:35.991 --> 03:00:38.027
NECESSARY RESOURCES FOR US TO

03:00:38.093 --> 03:00:39.328
MAKE SURE THAT THIS --

03:00:39.395 --> 03:00:40.863
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY IS

03:00:40.930 --> 03:00:42.198
IMPLEMENTED.

03:00:42.264 --> 03:00:43.666
THE AIR POLLUTION CONTROL FUND

03:00:43.732 --> 03:00:45.301
WOULD INITIALLY FUND THESE

03:00:45.367 --> 03:00:47.002
POSITIONS UNTIL FEES CAN BE

03:00:47.069 --> 03:00:49.271
COLLECTED TO PROVIDE ONGOING

03:00:49.338 --> 03:00:50.839
SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAM.

03:00:50.906 --> 03:00:52.274
AMBER REQUESTING THESE POSITIONS

BECAUSE QUITE FRANKLY WE WANT TO

03:00:58.314 --> 03:00:59.949
GET THIS EQUIPMENT OUT AS SOON

03:01:00.015 --> 03:01:01.016
AS POSSIBLE WE'VE GOT INCENTIVE

03:01:01.083 --> 03:01:02.618
PROGRAMS THAT ARE RUNNING AS

03:01:02.685 --> 03:01:03.919
WELL AS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.

03:01:03.986 --> 03:01:06.355
SO WITH THAT I'D BE HAPPY TO

03:01:06.422 --> 03:01:09.124
TAKE ANY QUESTIONS -- YOUR

03:01:09.191 --> 03:01:13.329
BUILDING OUT A NEW TESTING

03:01:13.395 --> 03:01:16.098
FACILITY DOWN AND IS A POMONA IN

03:01:16.165 --> 03:01:17.032
RIVERSIDE REVERSED IN RIVERSIDE

03:01:17.099 --> 03:01:18.267
YES WE'RE BUILDING A NEW

03:01:18.334 --> 03:01:18.934
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HEADQUARTERS

03:01:19.001 --> 03:01:21.537
AND AND WILL THIS -- TAKE PLACE

03:01:21.604 --> 03:01:22.938
IN THAT LOCATION OR WILL THEY BE

03:01:23.005 --> 03:01:23.539
HAD FOR MOST OF THE WORK THAT

03:01:23.606 --> 03:01:24.406
WE'RE GONNA BE DOING RELATED TO

03:01:24.473 --> 03:01:25.674
THESE KINDS OF THINGS ARE

03:01:25.741 --> 03:01:27.276
ACTUALLY.

03:01:27.343 --> 03:01:28.577
CERTIFICATIONS THAT WE WOULD --

03:01:28.644 --> 03:01:30.279
THAT TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPER WOULD

03:01:30.346 --> 03:01:32.281
DO TESTING THEY FREQUENTLY A

03:01:32.348 --> 03:01:34.116
CONTRACT FOR THAT TESTING AND WE

03:01:34.183 --> 03:01:35.150
WORK WITH THEM OR ESTABLISH

03:01:35.217 --> 03:01:36.385
PROCEDURES ON THE KINDS OF

03:01:36.452 --> 03:01:37.586
TESTING THAT ARE DONE.

03:01:37.653 --> 03:01:39.388
AND THEN WE WOULD EVALUATE THAT

03:01:39.455 --> 03:01:41.090
TESTING SO IT'S MORE OF A PAPER

03:01:41.156 --> 03:01:42.992
EXERCISE THAN THINGS THAT WE'RE

03:01:43.058 --> 03:01:44.793
TESTING IN THE LAB AND I'LL GIVE

03:01:44.860 --> 03:01:46.495
YOU AN EXAMPLE ONE OF THE THINGS

03:01:46.562 --> 03:01:48.664
THAT WE'VE TESTED UNDER THESE

03:01:48.731 --> 03:01:49.665
PROGRAMS IS.

03:01:49.732 --> 03:01:51.400
AND A NEW WAY FOR PEOPLE TO

03:01:51.467 --> 03:01:53.202
CONTROL EMISSIONS FROM SHIPS SO

03:01:53.269 --> 03:01:55.170
WHEN SHIPS COME IN AND WE DON'T

03:01:55.237 --> 03:01:56.205
WANT THEM TO RUN THEIR ENGINES

03:01:56.272 --> 03:01:57.740
BECAUSE THEY'RE REALLY DIRTY SO

03:01:57.806 --> 03:01:58.941
WE LIKE THEM TO PLAY AGAIN.

03:01:59.008 --> 03:02:00.609
THAT'S NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE FOR

03:02:00.676 --> 03:02:01.677
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AND OTHER

03:02:01.744 --> 03:02:03.345
THINGS SO FOLKS HAVE DEVELOPED A

03:02:03.412 --> 03:02:05.514
SYSTEM AND WE COLLOQUIALLY

03:02:05.581 --> 03:02:07.249
QUALITY THE BONNET.

03:02:07.316 --> 03:02:09.351
SO IT BASICALLY IS A BIG BONNET

03:02:09.418 --> 03:02:11.053
THAT SITS OVER THAT SINCE THE

03:02:11.120 --> 03:02:12.054
SMOKESTACK ON THE SHIP IN IT

03:02:12.121 --> 03:02:13.122
SUCKS UP THE EMISSIONS.

03:02:13.188 --> 03:02:14.490
SO THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW

03:02:14.556 --> 03:02:15.658
THE TESTING FOR THAT CAN'T

03:02:15.724 --> 03:02:17.593
HAPPEN IN OUR LAB IT HAPPENS ON

03:02:17.660 --> 03:02:19.061
SITE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE

03:02:19.128 --> 03:02:20.329
PROCEDURES ARE CRACKED AND

03:02:20.396 --> 03:02:23.966
EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT THEY NEED TO

03:02:24.033 --> 03:02:26.001
DO BEFORE HAND.

FACE TO REGULATIONS -- YOU WILL

03:02:48.991 --> 03:02:49.992

03:02:50.059 --> 03:02:51.727
THE SECOND PHASE OF GREENHOUSE

03:02:51.794 --> 03:02:53.128
GAS EMISSIONS STANDARDS THAT WE

03:02:53.195 --> 03:02:54.830
ADOPTED IN COORDINATION WITH

03:02:54.897 --> 03:02:55.898
USEPA.

03:02:55.964 --> 03:02:56.832
AND THE STANDARDS GOING TO

03:02:56.899 --> 03:02:58.634
REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

03:02:58.701 --> 03:03:01.503
BY ABOUT A THIRD OF MY TWENTY

03:03:01.570 --> 03:03:02.938
FIFTY WHILE ALSO REDUCING SMOG

03:03:03.005 --> 03:03:04.940
FORMING AN AIR TOXIC EMISSIONS.

03:03:05.007 --> 03:03:06.442
SO THERE'S TWO MAIN REASONS WE

03:03:06.508 --> 03:03:07.810
NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR

03:03:07.876 --> 03:03:10.312
THIS REGULATION THE FIRST IS THE

03:03:10.379 --> 03:03:11.313
ENGINES THATARE MEETING THE

03:03:11.380 --> 03:03:12.581
STANDARD ARE MUCH MORE

03:03:12.648 --> 03:03:14.383
COMPLICATED THAN THE ENGINES

03:03:14.450 --> 03:03:15.951
MEETING THE PHASE ONE STANDARD.

03:03:16.018 --> 03:03:17.853
AND ARE STE OUR REQUIREMENTS FOR

03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:19.288
DATA AND DOCUMENTATION HAVE

03:03:19.355 --> 03:03:21.457
INCREASED SO THINK ABOUT WHAT

03:03:21.523 --> 03:03:23.926
HAPPENED WITH THE W. WITH FIAT

03:03:23.992 --> 03:03:25.094
CHRYSLER WERE.

03:03:25.160 --> 03:03:29.498
WERE AMPING UP WHAT WE WANT ON

03:03:29.565 --> 03:03:30.232
FROM FACE TO ALSO INCLUDES

03:03:30.299 --> 03:03:30.799
GREENHOUSE GAS STANDARDS FOR

03:03:30.866 --> 03:03:32.634
TRAILERS AND FOR THE FIRST TIME

03:03:32.701 --> 03:03:33.635
WE'RE DEVELOPING NEW

03:03:33.702 --> 03:03:35.904
CERTIFICATIONS AT PROCESS FOR

03:03:35.971 --> 03:03:37.306
TRAILERS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO

03:03:37.373 --> 03:03:38.540
PROBABLY ABOUT A HUNDRED

03:03:38.607 --> 03:03:40.109
CERTIFICATIONS A YEAR.

03:03:40.175 --> 03:03:41.276
SO THE SECOND REASON THAT WE

03:03:41.343 --> 03:03:43.545
NEED MORE RESOURCES IS FOR THE

03:03:43.612 --> 03:03:45.781
PHASE ONE STANDARDS BASICALLY WE

03:03:45.848 --> 03:03:47.216
HAD A PROCESS THAT IF YOU COULD

03:03:47.282 --> 03:03:48.884

03:03:48.951 --> 03:03:51.153
TO USEPA WE DEEM DO YOU TO

03:03:51.220 --> 03:03:52.421
COMPLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA

03:03:52.488 --> 03:03:53.756
STANDARDS.

03:03:53.822 --> 03:03:55.257
IN THE FACE TO PROGRAM WERE

03:03:55.324 --> 03:03:57.259
TAKING A MORE ACTIVE ROLE IN

03:03:57.326 --> 03:03:58.360
THIS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:03:58.427 --> 03:03:59.828
THE REGULATION IS IMPLEMENTED

03:03:59.895 --> 03:04:01.029
THE WAY THAT IT'S WRITTEN.

03:04:01.096 --> 03:04:03.632
AND SO WE NEED MORE RESOURCES

03:04:03.699 --> 03:04:04.333
FOR THAT.

03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:05.367
AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THIS B.

03:04:05.434 --> 03:04:07.169
C. P. IS THE PROPOSED TRAILER

03:04:07.236 --> 03:04:08.871
BILL LANGUAGE TO ALLOW US TO

03:04:08.937 --> 03:04:11.173

ON ROAD VEHICLES AND ENGINES

03:04:12.474 --> 03:04:14.410
RIGHT NOW THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF

03:04:14.476 --> 03:04:16.145
FINES THAT WE CAN COLLECT FOR

POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS IN.

03:04:22.651 --> 03:04:23.185
TWENTY EIGHTEEN SO WHAT THIS

03:04:23.252 --> 03:04:24.720
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE DOES IS IT

03:04:24.787 --> 03:04:27.389
REMOVES IS IT REMOVES THE CAP.

03:04:27.456 --> 03:04:28.857
IT ALLOWS US TO SET UP A SAYS

03:04:28.924 --> 03:04:30.325

03:04:30.392 --> 03:04:31.360
TRAILERS.

03:04:31.427 --> 03:04:32.394

03:04:37.900 --> 03:04:38.834

03:04:38.901 --> 03:04:40.202
APPROVED WE WILL BEGIN THE

03:04:40.269 --> 03:04:42.137

PEST MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVES WE

03:06:46.695 --> 03:06:47.796

BRING THE SITE FOR LESS TOXIC

03:07:02.945 --> 03:07:06.448
ALTERNATIVES? TO THE THE FIELD

03:07:06.515 --> 03:07:07.416

ALTERNATIVES AVAILABLE AND OF

03:07:12.120 --> 03:07:13.021

REDUCE THE TOXICITY BY --

03:07:27.769 --> 03:07:30.105
BRINGING IN CERTAIN.

03:07:30.172 --> 03:07:30.872
THE SOIL -- MANIPULATIONS OR

03:07:30.939 --> 03:07:31.740
THINGS LIKE THAT THAT WOULD BE

03:07:31.807 --> 03:07:33.308

SO THE OTHER TWO POINT ONE

03:07:35.577 --> 03:07:36.878
MILLION DOLLARS WOULD BE FOR

PESTICIDES THIS WOULD BE AN

03:07:46.355 --> 03:07:47.556
ADDITIONAL TWO POINT ONE MILLION

03:09:16.545 --> 03:09:17.813
AS PART OF THAT.

03:09:17.879 --> 03:09:20.582
AND SO -- WHEN YOU ADD ALL THAT

03:09:20.649 --> 03:09:21.850
UP TOGETHER THEN THAT WOULD IN

03:09:21.917 --> 03:09:22.884
THIS IS ONE TIME THE MILLION AND

03:09:22.951 --> 03:09:29.324
A HALF WOULD RESULT IN US REALLY

03:09:29.391 --> 03:09:29.958
BEING ABLE TO BREAK THROUGH THAT

03:09:30.025 --> 03:09:30.792
LOG JAM TO GET A LOT OF THOSE

03:09:30.859 --> 03:09:31.526
PROJECTS MOVING ALONG?

03:09:31.593 --> 03:09:32.160
WITH THOSE PROJECTS TO DO IS IS

03:09:32.227 --> 03:09:33.462
THEY PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FIELD

03:09:33.528 --> 03:09:35.330
LEVEL DATA WORKING COLLECTIONS

03:09:35.397 --> 03:09:36.498
SO THAT YOU CAN GET

03:09:36.565 --> 03:09:37.833
REGISTRATIONS.

03:09:37.899 --> 03:09:39.568
ON MATERIALS THAT ARE LESS

03:09:39.634 --> 03:09:41.369
IMPACTFUL THAN SOMETHING LIKE

03:09:41.436 --> 03:09:42.571
CLEAR PER OF US BUT WE'RE NOT

03:09:42.637 --> 03:09:43.939
SOLELY FOCUSED IN ON THAT THE I.

03:09:44.005 --> 03:09:45.273
R. FOR LOOKS AT A WHOLE WIDE

03:09:45.340 --> 03:09:46.742
RANGE OF DIFFERENT MATERIALS FOR

03:09:46.808 --> 03:09:48.376
SPECIALLY CROP GROWERS.

03:09:48.443 --> 03:09:49.945
IN THERE THE DISADVANTAGE

03:09:50.011 --> 03:09:51.146
BECAUSE OF LOW AMOUNTS OF

03:09:51.213 --> 03:09:52.714
ACREAGE WHICH TRANSLATES INTO

03:09:52.781 --> 03:09:54.116
LOW AMOUNTS OF SELLABLE PRODUCT

03:09:54.182 --> 03:09:55.383
MANUFACTURERS TYPICALLY DON'T

03:09:55.450 --> 03:09:56.351
WANT TO SPEND THAT MONEY AND

03:09:56.418 --> 03:09:57.853
TIME TO REGISTER SOME OF THESE

03:09:57.919 --> 03:09:59.354
PROP PRODUCTS EVEN THOUGH THESE

03:09:59.421 --> 03:09:59.855
PRODUCTS.

03:09:59.921 --> 03:10:01.823
ARE MORE OR LESS IMPACTFUL TO

03:10:01.890 --> 03:10:02.958
THE ENVIRONMENT MIGHT EVEN BE

03:10:03.024 --> 03:10:04.760
MORE EFFICACIOUS TO THE GROWERS

03:10:04.826 --> 03:10:05.994
OF THE SPECIALTY CROPS.

03:10:06.061 --> 03:10:07.262
AND SO THAT'S WHAT THAT MONEY'S

03:10:07.329 --> 03:10:08.463
GOING TO GO TOWARDS.

03:10:08.530 --> 03:10:09.598
AND THEN THERE'S ALSO TWO

03:10:09.664 --> 03:10:11.566
MILLION GO TOWARDS BIOLOGICALLY

03:10:11.633 --> 03:10:13.335
INTEGRATED FARMING SYSTEMS AND

03:10:13.401 --> 03:10:15.470
THAT SORT OF A RESURRECTION OF A

03:10:15.537 --> 03:10:17.606
PROGRAM THAT YOU SEE COOPERATIVE

03:10:17.672 --> 03:10:19.808
EXTENSION HAD ABOUT THOUGH IT

03:10:19.875 --> 03:10:21.109
DOESN'T -- SO MORE YEARS AGO

03:10:21.176 --> 03:10:22.711
WHERE THEY DID DEMONSTRATION

03:10:22.778 --> 03:10:25.247
PROJECTS WITH GROWERS USING THE

03:10:25.313 --> 03:10:27.082
BODY OF KNOWLEDGE OF INTEGRATED

03:10:27.149 --> 03:10:28.884
PEST MANAGEMENT IN INTEGRATED

03:10:28.950 --> 03:10:30.585
THAT INTO FARMING SYSTEMS AND

03:10:30.652 --> 03:10:33.288
METHODOLOGY. TO DEMONSTRATE THAT

03:10:33.355 --> 03:10:35.056
LOWER INPUTS AND USING.

03:10:35.123 --> 03:10:36.191

OVERALL PESTICIDE USAGE.

03:10:43.331 --> 03:10:45.233
AS WELL AS THE LOWER FERTILIZER

INPUTS AND OTHER THINGS LIKE

03:10:45.901 --> 03:10:47.736
THAT THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED --

03:10:47.803 --> 03:10:50.438
MORE BENEFICIAL BUT YET GROWERS

03:10:50.505 --> 03:10:51.773
WOULD BE HESITANT BECAUSE THERE

03:10:51.840 --> 03:10:53.942
BE THE RISK OF YIELD LOSS OR NOT

03:10:54.009 --> 03:10:55.911
MAKING QUALITY CONSIDERATIONS.

03:10:55.977 --> 03:10:57.279
AS A DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS ARE

03:10:57.345 --> 03:10:59.247
A REALLY GOOD WAY TO DO THAT TO

03:10:59.314 --> 03:11:00.348
ROLL THAT OUT CLUB COOPER OF

DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS IN IT'S

03:11:07.889 --> 03:11:09.558
MONEY WELL SPENT BECAUSE THAN

03:11:09.624 --> 03:11:10.759
OTHER GROWERS SEE THAT?

03:11:10.826 --> 03:11:12.160
AND THAT'S REALLY HOW YOU SHIFT

03:11:12.227 --> 03:11:13.962
THE PARADIGM IN HOW GROWERS

03:11:14.029 --> 03:11:15.530

IT'S BEEN THAT MANY YEARS.

03:13:38.139 --> 03:13:39.441

PROPOSITION.

03:13:49.651 --> 03:13:51.019
TWELVE IN THIS MEASURE WHAT

03:13:51.086 --> 03:13:53.188
REQUIRES -- CERTAIN CONFINEMENT

03:13:53.254 --> 03:13:56.124
SPACE CONSIDERATIONS -- FOR

03:13:56.191 --> 03:14:00.061

INTRODUCE DOCTOR JONES A STATE

03:14:02.330 --> 03:14:03.932
THAT MERION AND SHE'LL BE HERE

03:14:03.999 --> 03:14:05.133
FOR THE NEXT TWO ITEMS.

03:14:05.200 --> 03:14:06.668
AND THIS FALLS UNDER HER AREA OF

03:14:06.735 --> 03:14:08.870
RESPONSIBILITY AND CHILLED

03:14:08.937 --> 03:14:10.605
DESCRIBE THE SYSTEM BY WHERE WE

03:14:10.672 --> 03:14:12.207
ALREADY DO SOMETHING KIND OF

03:14:12.273 --> 03:14:13.341
SIMILAR BUT IT'S NOT QUITE THE

03:14:13.408 --> 03:14:15.410
SAME IN THIS EXPANDS UPON THE

03:14:15.477 --> 03:14:16.845
REQUIREMENTS TO GET BROUGHT INTO

03:14:16.911 --> 03:14:18.213
THIS IN THE POULTRY SECTOR.

03:14:18.279 --> 03:14:20.548
AS FAR AS VERIFYING CAGE SIZES

03:14:20.615 --> 03:14:22.083
AND DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT --

03:14:22.150 --> 03:14:23.752
BUT WHAT THE SIMILARITIES WHAT

03:14:23.818 --> 03:14:24.986
MAKES THIS KIND OF COMPLEX AND

03:14:25.053 --> 03:14:25.987
WE'VE HAD A HARD TIME REALLY

03:14:26.054 --> 03:14:27.155
EXPLAINING IT BUT I THINK THAT

03:14:27.222 --> 03:14:28.123
WE'VE HAD BREAKTHROUGHS LATELY

03:14:28.189 --> 03:14:29.624
IN EXPLAINING IT IN A VERY

03:14:29.691 --> 03:14:31.192
SIMPLISTIC MANNER.

03:14:31.259 --> 03:14:32.560
THE PROPOSITION WAS WRITTEN IN A

03:14:32.627 --> 03:14:34.796
WAY THAT ALL THESE MEAT PRODUCTS.

03:14:34.863 --> 03:14:37.399
ARE REQUIRED TO THE ANIMAL SPACE

03:14:37.465 --> 03:14:38.867
CONFINEMENTS ARE REQUIRED TO BE

03:14:38.933 --> 03:14:40.001
MET FOR THE SUBSEQUENT ME

03:14:40.068 --> 03:14:41.669
PRODUCTS TO BE INTRODUCED INTO

03:14:41.736 --> 03:14:43.338
TRADE CHANNELS IN CALIFORNIA SO

03:14:43.405 --> 03:14:44.639
THAT'S WHAT REALLY DRIVES THIS

03:14:44.706 --> 03:14:45.206
AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT A

03:14:45.273 --> 03:14:46.608
LITTLE MORE COMPLEX WHEN YOU

03:14:46.674 --> 03:14:48.076
START LOOKING AT IT.

03:14:48.143 --> 03:14:49.444
VERSUS JUST SIMPLY SAYING THAT

03:14:49.511 --> 03:14:50.912
IT'S A SIMPLE VERIFICATION OF

03:14:50.979 --> 03:14:52.414
WHAT'S HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S

03:14:52.480 --> 03:14:54.015
WHAT TURNED CALIFORNIA TRACED

03:14:54.082 --> 03:14:55.917
BACK THROUGH TRADE CHANNELS

03:14:55.984 --> 03:14:58.119
ESPECIALLY WITH SWINE -- SINCE

03:14:58.186 --> 03:14:59.721
THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE ON

03:14:59.788 --> 03:15:01.089
THE FAILING OPERATIONS WHERE THE

03:15:01.156 --> 03:15:02.257
PIGLETS ARE PRODUCED BUT THAT'S

03:15:02.323 --> 03:15:03.691
NOT NECESSARILY WHO FEEDS AND

03:15:03.758 --> 03:15:05.627
FIISHES THEM OUT IN ALTERNATELY

03:15:05.693 --> 03:15:07.095
PUTS HIM IN THE MARKET PLACE.

03:15:07.162 --> 03:15:07.796
SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE OUR

03:15:07.862 --> 03:15:09.397
RESPONSIBILITIES ARE FAIRLY FAR

03:15:09.464 --> 03:15:10.765
REACHING AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED

03:15:10.832 --> 03:15:11.933
PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO DO THESE

03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:13.001
VERIFICATIONS.

03:15:13.068 --> 03:15:14.602
AND ALSO TO WRITE THE SUBSEQUENT

03:15:14.669 --> 03:15:16.538

03:15:16.604 --> 03:15:17.972
PROGRAMMATIC LEE OPERATE THIS

03:15:18.039 --> 03:15:19.641
AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO DR

03:15:19.707 --> 03:15:21.609
JON STEAD DETAILS.

03:15:21.676 --> 03:15:23.244
THANK YOU.

03:15:23.311 --> 03:15:24.312
WELCOME SUGGESTED MAYBE.

03:15:24.379 --> 03:15:24.846
REITERATE IT USING SOME
