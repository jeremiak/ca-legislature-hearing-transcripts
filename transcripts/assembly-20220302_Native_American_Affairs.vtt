SENSE OF JUST SOME WHERE I COME

FROM. BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL

00:38:04.382 --> 00:38:05.916
THINGS I WANTED TO DO THAT WE'RE

00:38:05.983 --> 00:38:07.451
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FROM MY

00:38:07.518 --> 00:38:10.354
PERSPECTIVE. TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:38:10.421 --> 00:38:12.223
HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA BUT

00:38:12.289 --> 00:38:14.592
ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW ARE

00:38:14.659 --> 00:38:17.828
ULTIMATELY. AND EVEN THOUGH I AM

00:38:17.895 --> 00:38:19.497
A PROFESSOR I DON'T WANT TO

00:38:19.563 --> 00:38:21.632
REALLY LECTURE LECTURES SO I AM

00:38:21.699 --> 00:38:24.535
GOING TO JUST TRY TO HIGHLIGHT

00:38:24.602 --> 00:38:28.072
IT FOR YOU IF I CAN. AND WE

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:32.143
TODAY ARE THE BENEFICIARIES OF-

00:38:32.209 --> 00:38:33.110
FOR THE LOT A LACK OF BETTER

00:38:33.177 --> 00:38:34.945
WORDS SOMETHING CALLED THE

00:38:35.012 --> 00:38:37.081
DOCTRINE OF DISCOVERY. AND THE

00:38:37.148 --> 00:38:38.416
DOCTOR DISCOVERY WAS SOMETHING

00:38:38.482 --> 00:38:40.785
THAT WAS CREATED IN THE LATE

00:38:40.851 --> 00:38:43.254
FOURTEEN HUNDREDS. TO BASICALLY

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.989
SOLIDIFIED THE RIGHT OF

00:38:45.056 --> 00:38:46.924
EUROPEANS AND THE CATHOLIC

00:38:46.991 --> 00:38:49.126
CHURCH AT THAT POINT IN TIME TO

00:38:49.193 --> 00:38:52.630
LAY CLAIM TO WHAT WAS ON. THE

00:38:52.697 --> 00:38:53.631
DISCOVER IT LANDS IN THE

00:38:53.698 --> 00:38:55.666
AMERICAS. AND THE ONLY WAY THAT

00:38:55.733 --> 00:38:57.968
THOSE EUROPEAN POWERS WHICH WERE

00:38:58.035 --> 00:38:58.869
ORIGINALLY SPAIN AND PORTUGAL

00:38:58.936 --> 00:39:01.505
COULD. EXERCISE DOMINION WOULD

00:39:01.572 --> 00:39:03.007
BE TO ALSO GET WHAT ARE CALLED

00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:05.476
THE GIFTS AND IN QUOTATION MARKS

00:39:05.543 --> 00:39:09.380
OF CONVERSION IN CIVILIZATION.

00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:12.516
AND IT WAS- THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE

00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:14.485
YOU DO THAT. THE COOKIES THE

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:16.954
DOORS DOWN DID NOT ENGAGE IN

00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:18.889
THAT RESPONSIBILITY QUICKLY

00:39:18.956 --> 00:39:21.092
BECAUSE THEIR GOAL WAS. TO LAY

00:39:21.158 --> 00:39:22.660
CLAIM TO THE LAND INTO TAKE

00:39:22.727 --> 00:39:24.695
ADVANTAGE OF ITS RESOURCES AND

00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:26.997
THE PEOPLE THAT LIVED IN IT

00:39:27.064 --> 00:39:30.701
OFTENTIMES YOU- WARFARE- AND

00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:33.938
CRUELTY. BUT EVENTUALLY THEY'RE

00:39:34.004 --> 00:39:37.274
INDIVIDUALS WHO WHO. DEMANDED

00:39:37.341 --> 00:39:42.713
THAT THEY. DO IT BECAUSE THEY

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.116
THEY HAD TO STAND BEFORE OD AT

00:39:45.182 --> 00:39:47.818
ONCE THE ONE PARTICULAR DAY. SO

00:39:47.885 --> 00:39:49.487
THE PRINCIPLES OF THAT DOCTOR

00:39:49.553 --> 00:39:50.721
BASICALLY WAS A LEGAL AND MORAL

00:39:50.788 --> 00:39:52.590
JUSTIFICATION BUT ALLOW THE

00:39:52.656 --> 00:39:55.626
PRESENCE OF EUROPEANS IN THAT.

00:39:55.693 --> 00:39:57.328
IN THE UNDISCOVERED AMERICA'S AT

00:39:57.394 --> 00:39:59.330
THAT POINT TIME. AND WHAT IS

00:39:59.396 --> 00:40:01.098
INTERESTING IS THAT THE OTHER

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:03.167
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WILL JOIN A

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:04.568
HUNDRED YEARS LATER I WILL

00:40:04.635 --> 00:40:06.303
CHOOSE TO FOLLOW THOSE

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:09.373
PRINCIPLES IT'S NOT A LAW BUT

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.475
THEIR PRINCIPLES. AND THEY ARE

00:40:11.542 --> 00:40:13.210
MORE INTERESTED IN SECURING THE

00:40:13.277 --> 00:40:15.212
RIGHT TO THE AMERICAS AGAINST

00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:17.014
EACH OTHER. AND THERE IS AN

00:40:17.081 --> 00:40:19.049
IMPLICIT RECOGNITION AS THE

00:40:19.116 --> 00:40:20.751
INDIANS WERE THERE FOR THE

00:40:20.818 --> 00:40:21.886
SIMPLE REASON THAT THEY WERE

00:40:21.952 --> 00:40:23.020
PHYSICALLY THERE YOU HAD TO

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:24.288
COUNT FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND

00:40:24.355 --> 00:40:26.757
HOW YOU'RE DOING IT. SO THERE

00:40:26.824 --> 00:40:28.492
THE RECOGNITION OF THEIR LACK

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:30.394
RIGHT TO THE LAND WAS PRESENT

00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:31.962
BUT IS INFERIOR BECAUSE THEY

00:40:32.029 --> 00:40:33.964
WERE CHRISTIAN. AND BECAUSE HE

00:40:34.031 --> 00:40:35.699
ALSO DIDN'T HAVE THE GOOD SENSE

00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:36.634
TO DEVELOP THE LAND LIKE IT

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.768
SHOULD BE LET SHOULD BE

00:40:37.835 --> 00:40:41.071
DEVELOPED ACCORDING TO EUROPEAN

00:40:41.138 --> 00:40:42.907
IDEAS. AND THERE WAS A VERY

00:40:42.973 --> 00:40:45.476
BLATANT- IGNORING OF THE FACT OF

00:40:45.543 --> 00:40:47.178
OTHER PARTS OF THE AMERICAS THAT

00:40:47.244 --> 00:40:49.980
HAD VERY ELABORATE CIVILIZATION

00:40:50.047 --> 00:40:52.016
IS AN AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT.

00:40:52.082 --> 00:40:55.052
IF THE NATIVES REFUSED YES OF

00:40:55.119 --> 00:40:57.388
CONVERSION AND CIVILIZATION. IT

00:40:57.454 --> 00:40:59.557
WOULD ALLOW FOR WARFARE END OF

00:40:59.623 --> 00:41:03.294
THE CALL JUST WARFARE. BECAUSE

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.395
OF THE TYPE OF HISTORY WITH

00:41:04.461 --> 00:41:06.664
PEOPLE. FEARED FOR THEIR SOULS

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.732
AND TO ENGAGE IN ON JUST WAR

00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:11.068
WOULD BE TO SUFFER YOUR REST OF

00:41:11.135 --> 00:41:13.804
YOUR LIFE AFTER DEATH IN A IN A

00:41:13.871 --> 00:41:15.673
HELL. THERE WAS ALSO A VERY

00:41:15.739 --> 00:41:17.541
SMALL PART IN THAT DOCTOR

00:41:17.608 --> 00:41:21.645
DISCOVERY THAT- SAID IF. THE

00:41:21.712 --> 00:41:23.314
CONVERSION OF CIVILIZATION WENT

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:26.383
WELL. THEN OF COURSE IS THE LAND

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:27.451
THAT BELONGED TO THE INDIANS

00:41:27.518 --> 00:41:29.553
ORIGINALLY WAS STILL RE RE BEING

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.256
RETAINED BY THEM. BUT THERE WAS

00:41:32.323 --> 00:41:34.625
THIS BELIEF THAT CONVERSION OF

00:41:34.692 --> 00:41:36.393
CIVILIZATION WOULD BE DONE SO

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:39.296
WELL THAT THEY SIMPLY BECOME A

00:41:39.363 --> 00:41:43.133
PROBLEM. AND BE A PART OF THE

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.836
SYSTEM USUALLY AS A P. ON IF YOU

00:41:45.903 --> 00:41:47.705
WILL GET AS A VERY SIMPLE FARMER

00:41:47.771 --> 00:41:49.039
AND THEN THEY WOULD SUPPORT THE

00:41:49.106 --> 00:41:52.843
DEVELOPMENT OF THE- OF THE

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:53.310
CIVILIZATION THAT THE

00:41:53.377 --> 00:41:54.545
ESTABLISHED. WHILE THIS WAS

00:41:54.612 --> 00:41:58.082
BEING DECIDED- AND SLOWLY

00:41:58.148 --> 00:42:00.117
IMPLEMENTED THERE'S TWO MEN AND

00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:01.952
ONE WAS A MAN CALLED BARTOLOME

00:42:02.019 --> 00:42:04.755
DE LAS CASAS. HE WAS A SPANIARD

00:42:04.822 --> 00:42:06.757
WHO BECAME A DOMINICAN PRIEST

00:42:06.824 --> 00:42:08.559
LATER IN LIFE AND THEN ONCE THEY

00:42:08.626 --> 00:42:10.194
PULL THE WHO IS ALSO A SPANIARD

00:42:10.261 --> 00:42:11.462
AND ISSUE A LITTLE AND NOT A

00:42:11.528 --> 00:42:14.398
THEOLOGIAN SURPRISING ENOUGH

00:42:14.465 --> 00:42:15.499
HE'S A LAYMEN WHO DID STUDY

00:42:15.566 --> 00:42:17.434
THEOLOGY. AS THERE WAS A

00:42:17.501 --> 00:42:21.238
DISCUSSION. ALL BETWEEN THE

00:42:21.305 --> 00:42:24.975
RELIGIOUS AUTHORITIES THE CHURCH

00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:27.611
AND THE EUROPEAN MONARCHS. THE

00:42:27.678 --> 00:42:30.648
INDIANS HAVE SOULS. BECAUSE IF

00:42:30.714 --> 00:42:32.383
THEY HAVE SOULS WE CAN'T LEAVE

00:42:32.449 --> 00:42:35.920
THEM. IN FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS

00:42:35.986 --> 00:42:37.388
EARLIER THERE WAS A DECISION

00:42:37.454 --> 00:42:39.456
MADE THAT PEOPLES OF AFRICA DO

00:42:39.523 --> 00:42:40.491
NOT HAVE SOULS THERE FOR

00:42:40.557 --> 00:42:42.459
JUSTIFICATION WAS ALLOW FOR

00:42:42.526 --> 00:42:45.229
THERE IS LATE. SO THEY HAD A BIG

00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:47.865
DEBATE IN A TOWN IN SPAIN. AND

00:42:47.932 --> 00:42:48.999
THERE WAS NO CLEAR WIN FROM A

00:42:49.066 --> 00:42:52.102
LEGAL PERSPECTIVE- ON. THOSE

00:42:52.169 --> 00:42:54.271
CLASSES SAID THE NATIVES HAD

00:42:54.338 --> 00:42:55.806
INDIGENOUS RIGHT TO THEIR LANDS

00:42:55.873 --> 00:42:57.641
AND TO BE TREATED AS FULLY

00:42:57.708 --> 00:42:59.810
CAPABLE HUMAN BEINGS. AND THAT

00:42:59.877 --> 00:43:04.048
THE ACTIONS OF THE CONQUISTADORS

00:43:04.114 --> 00:43:05.516
WERE ON CALL FOR UNJUSTIFIED.

00:43:05.582 --> 00:43:07.251
AWESOME SUPPORTERS SAID THAT

00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:09.186
THEY DID NOT HAVE SOULS AND THEY

00:43:09.253 --> 00:43:10.421
ARE HAVE THE RIGHT TO BE SAFE

00:43:10.487 --> 00:43:12.690
BUT THEY HAD BE TREATED WELL AS

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:15.659
SLAVES. AND THE OUTCOME OF THAT

00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:18.262
DEBATE WAS I'M NOT A CLEAR WIN.

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:19.830
ALL ACROSS THIS ONE FROM THE

00:43:19.897 --> 00:43:21.565
PERSPECTIVE OF THE FACT THAT

00:43:21.632 --> 00:43:23.801
THEY BELIEVE THE INDIA'S COULD

00:43:23.867 --> 00:43:26.136
NOT BE ENSLAVED THAT THEY DID IN

00:43:26.203 --> 00:43:29.139
FACT HAVE SOULS. BUT SIMPLE WITH

00:43:29.206 --> 00:43:31.041
THE SET ALSO PROVED TO THEM THAT

00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:34.378
THE INDIANS WERE LIKE CHILDREN.

00:43:34.445 --> 00:43:36.013
HE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO UTILIZE

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.848
OUR RESOURCES ARE THEIR LANDS

00:43:37.915 --> 00:43:40.451
AND THEY NEED TO BE TAUGHT HOW

00:43:40.517 --> 00:43:42.886
TO BE CIVILIZED PEOPLE. DO THE

00:43:42.953 --> 00:43:44.888
CONVERSION PROCESS AS WELL. SO

00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:47.458
THAT THE ROLE OF THE CHURCH AND

00:43:47.524 --> 00:43:49.393
THE STATE WOULD BE TO BE THEIR

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.729
PARENTS. AS THOUGH THEY WERE

00:43:51.795 --> 00:43:53.497
CHILDREN AND THEY HAVE THE RIGHT

00:43:53.564 --> 00:43:54.965
THEN TO TAKE OVER THE PROPERTY

00:43:55.032 --> 00:43:58.335
NEAR RESOURCES FOR THEIR BENEFIT

00:43:58.402 --> 00:44:00.304
. AND SO SPAIN THEN WE'LL

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:04.641
DEVELOP A SERIES OF. METHODS TO

00:44:04.708 --> 00:44:06.477
DO THE CONVERSION IS

00:44:06.543 --> 00:44:08.679
CIVILIZATION IN US ARE WE IN

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:11.315
CALIFORNIA. WE WILL FALL

00:44:11.382 --> 00:44:13.317
UNDERNEATH THE LAST OF THREE

00:44:13.384 --> 00:44:14.518
HUNDRED YEARS OF EXPERIMENTATION

00:44:14.585 --> 00:44:16.220
CALL THE MISSION PROCEEDING-

00:44:16.286 --> 00:44:18.822
PUBLIC COMPLEX MISSIONS WERE

00:44:18.889 --> 00:44:22.226
CREATED TO GIVE THE STORY OF

00:44:22.292 --> 00:44:23.394
RELIGION. AND THEN TO GET THE

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.461
KNOWLEDGE OF THE CAUGHT THE

00:44:24.528 --> 00:44:26.864
PRESIDIO WAS FOR IT THAT WOULD

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:28.298
GIVE GLORY TO THE STATE AND THE

00:44:28.365 --> 00:44:29.933
PUBLIC VIEW THAT HOME WHICH

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.335
WOULD BE THE BENEFIT OF THESE

00:44:31.402 --> 00:44:33.170
CONVERTERS CIVILIZED INDIA'S.

00:44:33.237 --> 00:44:35.339
THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE IN FLORIDA

00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:38.575
PARTS OF THE SOUTHWEST AND IN

00:44:38.642 --> 00:44:40.144
CALIFORNIA. YEAH SINCE WHICH TO

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.246
THEENGLISH SIDE VERY QUICKLY

00:44:42.312 --> 00:44:44.048
BECAUSE THEY- WILL CHOOSE TO

00:44:44.114 --> 00:44:45.549
FOLLOW CONVERGENCE OF ALLIES WAS

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:48.318
ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE DUCATION

00:44:48.385 --> 00:44:52.723
CALIFORNIA. V. BECAUSE THEY WERE

00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:54.758
NOT MONOLITHIC MEDIAN ALL

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:57.027
CATHOLIC COUNTRIES IN EUROPE AND

CHURCH THAT WAS TRYING TO

00:45:07.971 --> 00:45:09.440
SURVIVE THERE. THERE IS SO EACH

OF THE COMPANIES WILL HAVE A

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:11.842
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TAKE ON IT

00:45:11.909 --> 00:45:13.077
BECAUSE OF WHATEVER THE

00:45:13.143 --> 00:45:14.478
RELATIONSHIP IS TO THE

AT THE NEW ENGLAND AREA. THEY

00:45:24.221 --> 00:45:27.157

TO CREATE A FREE TOWN WHERE THEY

00:46:46.203 --> 00:46:47.137
CAN PRACTICE CHRISTIAN

00:46:47.204 --> 00:46:49.239
PRINCIPLES BUT ALSO CONVERT TO

00:46:49.306 --> 00:46:51.241
OUR LAND TO RETURN TO THEIR

00:46:51.308 --> 00:46:53.744
TRADITIONAL WAYS OF. COMMON LAND

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:56.213
HOLDING FOR EXAMPLE OF COMMUNAL

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.116
SHARING IS. AND SO YOU HAVE TO

00:46:59.183 --> 00:47:01.485
HELP ME WITH THAT ENGLISH. THEIR

00:47:01.552 --> 00:47:03.086
CONVERGENCE OF ALLIES IS TO GO

00:47:03.153 --> 00:47:06.690
OUT AND SELECT KEEP PEOPLE.

00:47:06.757 --> 00:47:09.660
AMONG THE OF. LEADERSHIP OF THE

00:47:09.726 --> 00:47:11.662
TRIBES TO COVER CIVILIZE THEM

00:47:11.728 --> 00:47:13.397
AND TO BRING BACK THEIR ELEMENTS

00:47:13.463 --> 00:47:15.199
OF CHRISTIANITY BUT THEY HAD

00:47:15.265 --> 00:47:16.800
ALSO THINK THEY WERE WORTHY YET

00:47:16.867 --> 00:47:18.168
BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE THE FAMOUS

00:47:18.235 --> 00:47:20.504
LANGUAGE OF THE INDIANS WERE

00:47:20.571 --> 00:47:23.373
THE- HISPANA SATAN THAT COMES

00:47:23.440 --> 00:47:25.008
FROM SOME OF THE PURITAN METHOD.

00:47:25.075 --> 00:47:27.311
LEADERS AS WELL. SO THERE'S BEEN

00:47:27.377 --> 00:47:29.613
A VERY SO WHERE DO WE GET THIS I

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.914
DO NEED TO CONVERT THE CIVILIZED

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:32.883
INDIANS EDUCATE INDIA'S IS IT IS

GOING TO COME FROM THE DOCTOR

00:47:34.618 --> 00:47:36.620
DISCOVERY. IS GOING TO COME THIS

00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:39.223
IDEA THAT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

00:47:39.289 --> 00:47:41.058
JUSTIFY BEFORE THE EYES OF GOD.

00:47:41.124 --> 00:47:42.960
THAT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO BE HERE

00:47:43.026 --> 00:47:46.230
AND BECAUSE- WE ARE HERE. WILL

00:47:46.296 --> 00:47:47.531
BRING THESE ISSUES TO THE POINT

00:47:47.598 --> 00:47:48.865
WHERE WE ARE SO FAR AHEAD OF

00:47:48.932 --> 00:47:52.002
THEM IN CIVILIZATION CAN BRING

00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:55.739
THEM. MORE FURRY ROCKS- DISEASE

00:47:55.806 --> 00:47:59.476
TAKES ITS TOLL. EVENTUALLY WE

00:47:59.543 --> 00:48:00.811
HAVE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE

00:48:00.877 --> 00:48:03.247
BOARDING SCHOOLS. NOW BOARDING

00:48:03.313 --> 00:48:04.581
SCHOOLS AS WE UNDERSTAND THEM

00:48:04.648 --> 00:48:07.718
TODAY DIDN'T EXIST PRIOR TO

00:48:07.784 --> 00:48:08.952
THEIR ACTUAL ESTABLISHMENT BUT

00:48:09.019 --> 00:48:10.454
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FOREMOST

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.955
ALBERTA BOARDING SCHOOLS UNDER

00:48:12.022 --> 00:48:14.157
THE FEDERAL SYSTEM. A LOT OF

00:48:14.224 --> 00:48:15.559
PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT- SOME OF

00:48:15.626 --> 00:48:17.294
THE IVY LEAGUE SCHOOLS ON THE

00:48:17.361 --> 00:48:18.762
EAST COAST HARBOR IS ONE

00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:20.831
EXAMPLE. HAS PART OF THEIR

00:48:20.897 --> 00:48:23.834
CHARTER TO YOU KNOW CONVERT IN

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:26.370
TO EDUCATE INDIA AND SEND THE

00:48:26.436 --> 00:48:28.205
DISSEMINATE RIGHT AND ONE OF THE

00:48:28.272 --> 00:48:30.707
EARLIEST AUDITORIUMS IS OF THEIR

00:48:30.774 --> 00:48:32.709
GRADUATE DO YOU FEEL THE OLOGY

00:48:32.776 --> 00:48:34.344
SCHOOL STUDENTS WOULD BE AMERICA

00:48:34.411 --> 00:48:35.646
WOULD BE AN AMERICAN INDIAN I

00:48:35.712 --> 00:48:39.750
THINK FROM. MARTHA'S VINEYARD IF

00:48:39.816 --> 00:48:40.651
I REMEMBER CORRECTLY. BUT WHAT

00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:41.885
WE'RE ABOUT HERE TODAY IS VERY

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:44.054
UNIVERSAL APPROACH TO THE

00:48:44.121 --> 00:48:47.157
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO. BRING

00:48:47.224 --> 00:48:48.859
INDIANS TO THE POINT OF

00:48:48.925 --> 00:48:51.094
CONVERSION IN CIVILIZATION AT

00:48:51.161 --> 00:48:53.063
THIS POINT TIME OUR COUNTRY IS

00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:53.764
PRIMARILY WHITE ABLE SAXON

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:55.966
PROTESTANT. SO THE VERSIONS OF

00:48:56.033 --> 00:48:58.201
CHRISTIANITY FOR US ARE GOING TO

00:48:58.268 --> 00:49:00.337
BE PROSTITUTES AND FOR A VERY

00:49:00.404 --> 00:49:02.973
BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME- CHURCHES

00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.608
COULD ACTUALLY PETITION IT

00:49:04.675 --> 00:49:06.209
BECOME FEDERAL BOARDING SCHOOLS

00:49:06.276 --> 00:49:08.979
BUT THERE WAS A WILD CRAZY

00:49:09.046 --> 00:49:11.315
OUTCRY AGAINST THIS THE MIXING

00:49:11.381 --> 00:49:12.549
OF CHURCH AND STATE SO THEY

00:49:12.616 --> 00:49:14.117
SEPARATED IT. BUT THE PRINCIPLES

00:49:14.184 --> 00:49:15.485
THE TENNIS OF PROTESTANT

00:49:15.552 --> 00:49:16.453
CHRISTIANITY WERE VERY

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.922
FOUNDATIONAL TO THE RUNNING OF

00:49:18.989 --> 00:49:20.924
THE SCHOOLS. AND THE VERY SIMPLE

00:49:20.991 --> 00:49:23.093
PURPOSE IS TO CONVERT SYMBOLIZES

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.194
INDIA'S TURN AMERICAN WAY OF

00:49:24.261 --> 00:49:28.598
LIFE. A CAPTAIN CRACKED IS GIVEN

00:49:28.665 --> 00:49:31.501
AND- RECOGNITION AS BEING THE

00:49:31.568 --> 00:49:33.170
ORIGINAL FOUNDER OF THE SPECIAL

00:49:33.236 --> 00:49:34.838
BOARDING SCHOOL SYSTEM THE START

00:49:34.905 --> 00:49:37.107
AT CARLISLE INDIAN SCHOOL. AND

00:49:37.174 --> 00:49:38.608
HIS FAMOUS QUOTE IS THAT YOU

00:49:38.675 --> 00:49:41.478
SAVE THE U. YOU SAVE THE MAN

00:49:41.545 --> 00:49:43.847
KILLING THE INDIA AND SO HE'LL

00:49:43.914 --> 00:49:48.251
MOVE AHEAD WITH THAT. CONFORMITY

00:49:48.318 --> 00:49:51.555
IS ON REQUIRED IN THE BOARDING

00:49:51.621 --> 00:49:53.724
SCHOOLS AND THAT THE HORRIBLE

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:54.558
THINGS THAT HAPPENED WERE WERE

00:49:54.624 --> 00:49:56.960
VERY TRUE PUBLIC BEATINGS FOR

00:49:57.027 --> 00:49:59.463
SPEAKING THE TRIBAL LANGUAGES-

00:49:59.529 --> 00:50:02.599
MOCHRIE AND- OF THEIR WAYS OF

00:50:02.666 --> 00:50:05.969
LIFE HOW THEY LIVE HOW THEY WORK

00:50:06.036 --> 00:50:06.837
TO HELP THE HOUSES THEY LIVED

00:50:06.903 --> 00:50:08.872
IN. AND OF COURSE YOU'VE GOT THE

00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:11.942
HAIR CUT THEY HAD TO WEAR

00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:14.177
UNIFORMS. DISLOCATION FROM THEIR

00:50:14.244 --> 00:50:17.080
HOMES- OF FORCIBLE REMOVAL FROM

00:50:17.147 --> 00:50:20.250
THEIR HOMES. SOMETIMES WHEN THEY

00:50:20.317 --> 00:50:22.619
DISCOVER THAT THEY LIVE TOO

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:23.220
CLOSE TO THE TRADITIONAL

00:50:23.286 --> 00:50:25.555
HOMELANDS THEY KNEW THEY HAD TO

00:50:25.622 --> 00:50:28.592
THEN TAKE CHILDREN FAR AWAY AND

00:50:28.658 --> 00:50:29.426
THEY DID SOMETIMES A THOUSAND

00:50:29.493 --> 00:50:31.027
MILES AWAY THEORETICALLY

00:50:31.094 --> 00:50:32.996
STUDENTS COULD GO HOME BUT THEY

00:50:33.063 --> 00:50:34.464
HAD TO GET PERMISSION TO DO IT.

00:50:34.531 --> 00:50:36.633
PARENTS CAN SHOW UP IN THE

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:37.701
COMPLIANCE THE KIDS WEREN'T

00:50:37.768 --> 00:50:42.005
THERE. OF SOMERS THEY CAN GO

00:50:42.072 --> 00:50:43.740
HOME OF THE ONE OF THE CULT

00:50:43.807 --> 00:50:45.809
AUDIENCE IN THESE OUTINGS WOULD

00:50:45.876 --> 00:50:47.711
LIVE WITH FAMILIES THAT WOULD

00:50:47.778 --> 00:50:49.446
TEACH THEM YOU KNOW THE BENEFITS

00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:51.648
OF RUNNING IT A PERFECT. WHITE

00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:56.586
HOUSEHOLD. SO THAT THAT BUT.

00:50:56.653 --> 00:51:00.257
INDIA'S RESISTED. OUR CHILDREN

00:51:00.323 --> 00:51:03.260
RESISTANCE AND IF YOU THINK OF

00:51:03.326 --> 00:51:04.661
YOUR OWN CHILDREN AT HOME HOW

00:51:04.728 --> 00:51:06.663
OFTEN DO THEY FIND A WAY TO GET

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:09.266
AROUND YOUR RULES I REMEMBER MY

00:51:09.332 --> 00:51:11.935
FATHER TELLING. YOU THAT- I

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:16.173
COULD NOT- WEAR MAKE UP EIGHTH

00:51:16.239 --> 00:51:17.607
GRADE AND I WAS GOING TO THE

00:51:17.674 --> 00:51:19.576
MISSION SCHOOL A DAY SCHOOL AND

00:51:19.643 --> 00:51:23.380
NOW. SO I FIGURED OUT YOU KNOW

00:51:23.447 --> 00:51:24.781
WELL ALL THE STATEMENTS OF

00:51:24.848 --> 00:51:25.682
BERRIES AND I'LL GET THE

00:51:25.749 --> 00:51:27.551
CHARCOAL MIX IT WITH A LITTLE

00:51:27.617 --> 00:51:29.252
BIT OF WAX AND- YOU KNOW PUT

00:51:29.319 --> 00:51:31.421
MASCARA ON MY EYEBROWS AND- EYES

00:51:31.488 --> 00:51:33.290
AND A DAD I DID NOT USE ANY MAKE

00:51:33.356 --> 00:51:35.125
UP I USE THE NATURAL PRODUCTS OF

00:51:35.192 --> 00:51:38.161
LIFE. SO YOU KNOW HIS KIDS FIND

00:51:38.228 --> 00:51:40.764
WAYS TO GET AROUND THE RULES IN

00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:45.101
THE INDIAN KIDS DID IT- THEY

00:51:45.168 --> 00:51:45.902
SLOW DOWN THEIR PROGRESS

00:51:45.969 --> 00:51:46.803
DELIBERATELY. THE CLASS LATE

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:48.772
TURN IN ASSIGNMENTS LATE. ONE

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:50.574
AWAY WHICH OFTEN TIMES HAD

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.043
TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES. ON THE LINE

00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:56.112
SINCE WITH EACH OTHER.

00:51:56.179 --> 00:51:58.448
PROTECTIVE VALUE THE MOST WEEK-

00:51:58.515 --> 00:52:00.217
TRIBES THAT WERE FORMER ENEMIES

00:52:00.283 --> 00:52:01.985
THEY LEARN TO OVERCOME THEIR

00:52:02.052 --> 00:52:03.153
DIFFERENCES TO A CERTAIN DEGREE

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:05.322
CREATE A PAN INDIAN ISM. I TELL

00:52:05.388 --> 00:52:07.958
MY STUDENTS THAT THE IRONY OF

00:52:08.024 --> 00:52:09.159
THE BOARDING SCHOOL WHICH WAS

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:11.094
INTENDED TO WIPE OUT TRIBAL

00:52:11.161 --> 00:52:14.698
IDENTITY. AND TO DIMINISH THE

00:52:14.764 --> 00:52:17.868
CONNECTION TO HOME AND HOMELANDS

00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:20.270
. IT BACKFIRED BECAUSE THE

00:52:20.337 --> 00:52:22.105
INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL WASN'T

00:52:22.172 --> 00:52:23.840
INTENDED BUT THE INDIAN BOARDING

00:52:23.907 --> 00:52:26.042
SCHOOLS BECAME LIKE THE ELITE

00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:28.445
BOARDING SCHOOLS OF EUROPE AND

00:52:28.512 --> 00:52:31.448
AMERICA. IT'S ONLY THE BEST OF

00:52:31.515 --> 00:52:33.250
THE BEST LOOK TO THOSE SCHOOLS

00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:34.417
THEY CREATED THEIR ALLIANCES

00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:36.119
THEIR MARRIAGES THEY SHARE THEIR

00:52:36.186 --> 00:52:37.954
POWER AND THEIR RESOURCES THEY

00:52:38.021 --> 00:52:40.390
CREATED COMMUNICATION NETWORK

00:52:40.457 --> 00:52:41.658
AND PUT THE STRESS ON

00:52:41.725 --> 00:52:43.593
COMMUNICATION AND NETWORK. THESE

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.995
INDIAN KIDS LEFT THE BOARDING

00:52:45.061 --> 00:52:46.329
SCHOOLS AND THOSE WHO WENT HOME

00:52:46.396 --> 00:52:49.065
AND WERE SIXTH IN ALL WERE ABLE

00:52:49.132 --> 00:52:49.666
TO RE ESTABLISH THE

00:52:49.733 --> 00:52:51.668
RELATIONSHIPS THEY CREATED A

00:52:51.735 --> 00:52:54.804
NETWORK. EVENT NETWORK HULU

00:52:54.871 --> 00:52:58.308
TOGETHER SO NO MATTER WHAT OUR

00:52:58.375 --> 00:53:02.045
TRIBAL DIFFERENCES. WE CAN FORM

00:53:02.112 --> 00:53:04.514
ALLIANCES AND RELATIONSHIPS THAT

00:53:04.581 --> 00:53:05.916
WILL CARRY US THROUGH THE WORST

00:53:05.982 --> 00:53:07.584
OF WHATEVER THE AMERICANS HAVE

00:53:07.651 --> 00:53:09.920
TO GIVE TO US WASN'T EXPECTED TO

00:53:09.986 --> 00:53:11.288
STRENGTHEN THE ROOTS OF THE

00:53:11.354 --> 00:53:15.225
TRIBAL PEOPLES. CREATED TRIBAL

00:53:15.292 --> 00:53:17.627
IDENTITIES WHERE YOU WERE NOT

00:53:17.694 --> 00:53:19.462
JUST ONE TRIBE MAYBE SEVERAL OF

00:53:19.529 --> 00:53:20.830
MY GRANDPARENTS MET SHERMAN

00:53:20.897 --> 00:53:22.232
INDIAN HIGH SCHOOL DIFFERENT

00:53:22.299 --> 00:53:24.634
TRIBES CAME TOGETHER. ON

00:53:24.701 --> 00:53:26.536
EXPECTED THAT THERE'S SO MUCH

00:53:26.603 --> 00:53:28.405
LITERATURE ON THE HORSE A

00:53:28.471 --> 00:53:31.374
BOARDING SCHOOL THAT ARM. YEAH

00:53:31.441 --> 00:53:32.776
YOU NEED TO READ IT YOU CAN. THE

00:53:32.842 --> 00:53:34.444
DOWNSIDE SO BUT YOU KNOW BESIDES

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:35.612
WONDERFUL BEING ABANDONED USE

00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:37.247
THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT THEY DIDN'T

00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:37.847
HAVE GOOD ROLE MODELS AMONG

00:53:37.914 --> 00:53:40.317
ADULTS. SO IT MADE IT DIFFICULT

00:53:40.383 --> 00:53:41.918
WHEN THEY BECAME ADULTS HOW TO

00:53:41.985 --> 00:53:43.353
BECOME A FAMILY IN THAT RESPECT

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:45.188
OTHER RAISE YOUR CHILDREN IN

00:53:45.255 --> 00:53:47.123
THAT RESPECT. OF THOSE VERY

00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:48.658
EARLY YEARS SOME OF THEM YOU

00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:50.360
KNOW EXPERIENCED ACTUAL WARFARE

00:53:50.427 --> 00:53:52.062
THEY SAW THE TRAUMA OF HAVING

00:53:52.128 --> 00:53:54.297
PEOPLE. GUIDED BEFORE THEIR

00:53:54.364 --> 00:53:57.500
EYEBALLS ON. SO THAT TAT DOES

00:53:57.567 --> 00:54:00.103
DOES DOWNSIZE THAT ARE VERY VERY

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:03.573
REAL. IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES.

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:05.442
THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION DID A

00:54:05.508 --> 00:54:08.445
STUDY. OF YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING

00:54:08.511 --> 00:54:09.412
ON IN OUR FEDERAL INDIAN

00:54:09.479 --> 00:54:10.447
BOARDING SCHOOLS IN INDIAN

00:54:10.513 --> 00:54:12.015
COUNTRY IN GENERAL AND THEY ALSO

00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:16.753
HAD A STUDY OF EDUCATION. AND

00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:19.022
THAT DOES THAT STUDY SAID WE

00:54:19.089 --> 00:54:20.924
NEED TO CLOSE THESE BODIES

00:54:20.991 --> 00:54:22.959
CLOSED OUT NOW. BECAUSE THE BOYS

00:54:23.026 --> 00:54:23.893
BECAUSE IT HAPPENED ACTUALLY

00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:27.864
MUCH EARLIER THE IDEA BUT THE

00:54:27.931 --> 00:54:28.865
LIMITATION HAS NOT REALLY TAKEN

00:54:28.932 --> 00:54:29.899
PLACE. AND THOSE FORTY SCHOOLS A

00:54:29.966 --> 00:54:31.968
STATE EXISTENCE THE CURRICULUM

00:54:32.035 --> 00:54:33.103
HAD TO GO THROUGH A RADICAL

00:54:33.169 --> 00:54:35.138
REVISION. AND THAT'S HOW JUNIOR

00:54:35.205 --> 00:54:37.440
SHERMAN STARTED ON THE

00:54:37.507 --> 00:54:40.043
GENERATION AHEAD OF ME THEY

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:41.678
FOUGHT THE BATTLE THEY GOT THEY

00:54:41.745 --> 00:54:57.794
GOT

00:55:01.965 --> 00:55:03.700
WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO THIS TO

00:55:03.767 --> 00:55:05.468
REPRESENT THE SOUTHERN TRIBES IN

00:55:05.535 --> 00:55:07.370
CALIFORNIA AND I HAPPENED AND I

00:55:07.437 --> 00:55:09.472
WAS SELECTED NICE I BECAME ONE

00:55:09.539 --> 00:55:11.041
OF THE THREE CALIFORNIA INDIANS

00:55:11.107 --> 00:55:13.243
WHO THEN REPRESENTED. THE STATE

00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:14.978
OF CALIFORNIA IN THE SHERMAN ARE

00:55:15.045 --> 00:55:17.847
INDIAN SCHOOL BOARD. AND THEN

00:55:17.914 --> 00:55:19.382
THE REMAINING CANDIDATES ON THE

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:21.451
SCHOOL BOARD FOR THE MOST

00:55:21.518 --> 00:55:24.120
POPULAR OF ALL OF. THE LARGEST

00:55:24.187 --> 00:55:27.557
TRIBES AT THE SCHOOL SO WE HAD

00:55:27.624 --> 00:55:29.893
NOW TO HOLD APACHES. UP HE WAS-

00:55:29.959 --> 00:55:31.494
TO NAME SOME OF THE TRIBES THAT

00:55:31.561 --> 00:55:33.129
WERE THERE AND WE WORK TOGETHER

00:55:33.196 --> 00:55:35.365
TO REVIEW THE CURRICULUM TO

00:55:35.432 --> 00:55:37.400
INTRODUCE NEW CURRICULUM. AND TO

00:55:37.467 --> 00:55:39.936
TRY TO IMPLEMENT THE RIGHTS OF

00:55:40.003 --> 00:55:41.571
THE CHILDREN IN THE RIGHTS OF

00:55:41.638 --> 00:55:42.672
THE TRIBES WITH THE SCHOOL

00:55:42.739 --> 00:55:45.241
BOARD. AND IT WAS ROCKY BECAUSE

00:55:45.308 --> 00:55:47.677
AT FIRST THE FORMER SCHOOL BOARD

00:55:47.744 --> 00:55:49.913
WHERE THEY WERE. SOMEWHAT IN

00:55:49.979 --> 00:55:51.681
EXISTENCE MORE LIKE RUBBER

00:55:51.748 --> 00:55:55.485
STAMPS. ALL ALL PROBLEM. THIS IS

00:55:55.552 --> 00:55:57.253
THE PERSONAL OPINION A PROBLEM

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.956
WITHIN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM IS

00:56:00.023 --> 00:56:02.826
THAT OUT. OF WHAT CAN BE TEN YOU

00:56:02.892 --> 00:56:05.128
KNOW SHORT OF LIKE DO SOME

00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:07.097
EGREGIOUS OFFENSE OF HORRIBLE

00:56:07.163 --> 00:56:11.568
CRYING YOU CONSPIRACY THERE

00:56:11.634 --> 00:56:14.237
FOREVER AND DO YOUR JOB- SO THAT

00:56:14.304 --> 00:56:16.339
GETTING PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND

00:56:16.406 --> 00:56:18.475
THAT THIS THE SCHOOLS WITH THE

00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:21.611
HOMES OF THE KIDS. AT ALL WAS TO

00:56:21.678 --> 00:56:22.812
MAKE THE MEN'S NOT JUST GOOD

00:56:22.879 --> 00:56:24.748
CITIZENS GOOD TRAVEL SO SINCE

00:56:24.814 --> 00:56:26.149
AND GOOD PEOPLE SKILLS AND

00:56:26.216 --> 00:56:27.550
ABILITIES TO TRANSFER ON THE

00:56:27.617 --> 00:56:30.820
CALL AGENTS TO DO WHATEVER IS

00:56:30.887 --> 00:56:31.821
NEEDED FOR THEIR TRIBE. THAT IS

00:56:31.888 --> 00:56:34.157
BASICALLY WE GOTTA GET UP TO

00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:36.559
SCHOOL. AND WHATEVER WILL MAKE

00:56:36.626 --> 00:56:39.562
IT WORK WILL WORK. WE HAD ONE

00:56:39.629 --> 00:56:41.631
INDIVIDUAL WHO. ALL WOULDN'T

00:56:41.698 --> 00:56:47.904
TÍNH THE SUBSTITUTE. OF SPORTS

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:51.407
AND ON PHYSICAL EDUCATION OR

00:56:51.474 --> 00:56:54.043
ENGLISH CREDITS. BECAUSE ALL

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:55.345
THEY HAD TO DO WAS SHOW THE

00:56:55.411 --> 00:56:57.313
NUMBER OF CREDITS THAT THEY DID

00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:58.782
YOU GRADUATE THAT KIND OF THING

00:56:58.848 --> 00:57:00.483
SO THE FOCUS IS A GREEN CREDIT

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:01.885
OF ACCRUING CRESTING GRADUATE

00:57:01.951 --> 00:57:04.120
BUT NOT NECESSARILY FEELS THAT

00:57:04.187 --> 00:57:06.756
WOULD MAKE YOU- A WELL EDUCATED

00:57:06.823 --> 00:57:10.226
PERSON. CRICKET THE CAMPUSES ARE

00:57:10.293 --> 00:57:11.728
NOT WELL KEPT UP BUT THAT'S

00:57:11.795 --> 00:57:15.165
IRONY OF IT. AND THIS IS THE- AS

00:57:15.231 --> 00:57:19.068
IN PART IS THAT. THE KIDS OF THE

00:57:19.135 --> 00:57:20.703
MID TO LATE TWENTIETH CENTURY

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:22.505
LIKE THE KIDS FROM A HUNDRED

00:57:22.572 --> 00:57:25.108
YEARS EARLIER. THEY TOOK WHAT

00:57:25.175 --> 00:57:27.777
THE SCHOOL HAD TO MAKE IT WORK

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:32.348
FOR THEM. AND I GUESS MY STORY

00:57:32.415 --> 00:57:35.418
HERE FOR YOU IS NOT TO DWELL ON

00:57:35.485 --> 00:57:37.053
THE HOLDERS OF THE BOARDING

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:39.355
SCHOOLS NOT TO DWELL ON WHAT IT

00:57:39.422 --> 00:57:41.658
TOOK AWAY SO MUCH AS TO SHOW HOW

00:57:41.724 --> 00:57:44.360
OBEY ME THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES

00:57:44.427 --> 00:57:46.763
GAINED IT BACK IT'S NOT IT

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:48.731
WASN'T A PERFECT SYSTEM THERE'S

00:57:48.798 --> 00:57:53.303
STILL WERE PROBLEMS THERE- BUT-

00:57:53.369 --> 00:57:56.039
IT'S CHAU THE INADEQUACIES ALSO.

00:57:56.105 --> 00:57:57.507
AND THAT AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT

00:57:57.574 --> 00:57:59.642
I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU SO TO

00:57:59.709 --> 00:58:01.744
SUM IT UP BECAUSE I THINK MY

00:58:01.811 --> 00:58:02.745
FIFTEEN MINUTES OF. HAVE

00:58:02.812 --> 00:58:04.414
EXCEEDED. YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:05.915
THE DOCTOR DISCOVERY WITH THIS

00:58:05.982 --> 00:58:07.817
FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF IT HAD A

00:58:07.884 --> 00:58:10.286
RIGHT TO THE LAND. THE ONLY WAY

00:58:10.353 --> 00:58:12.622
TO JUSTIFY FOR THE EYES OF

00:58:12.689 --> 00:58:14.257
BEFORE THE EYES OF A BOD ARE THE

00:58:14.324 --> 00:58:15.925
STATE ITSELF WE'RE TWO DIFFERENT

00:58:15.992 --> 00:58:17.927
. THE INDIANS. THEN THAT

00:58:17.994 --> 00:58:19.362
EUROPEAN NATIONS FOUGHT AMONGST

00:58:19.429 --> 00:58:21.297
THEMSELVES OVER WHOSE CONVERSION

00:58:21.364 --> 00:58:24.834
TO WHOSE GOD WHO CIVILIZATION.

00:58:24.901 --> 00:58:26.903
AND THEN THAT WOULD JUSTIFY THE

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:29.138
TAKING OF THE LAND AND THE

00:58:29.205 --> 00:58:30.740
DESTRUCTION OF THE PEOPLE IN

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.381
IN DURING THE PROLONGED

01:11:59.448 --> 01:12:00.349
SEPARATION FROM FAMILY AND

01:12:00.416 --> 01:12:02.084
COMMUNITY ACCRUAL FORM OF

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:04.153
PUNISHMENT AWAITED. AFTER STUDY

01:12:04.219 --> 01:12:05.888
INDOCTRINATION OF WHITE EUROPEAN

01:12:05.954 --> 01:12:08.090
AMERICAN CULTURE. A FORMER

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:09.324
STUDENTS COULD NOT ADJUST TO

01:12:09.391 --> 01:12:11.060
LIFE ON THE RESERVATION AND

01:12:11.126 --> 01:12:11.694
PURSUE DIFFERENT LIFE WAYS IN

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.729
THE CITIES. THERE ARE MANY YOUNG

01:12:13.796 --> 01:12:15.297
YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERIENCE EXTREME

01:12:15.364 --> 01:12:17.099
FORMS OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:17.766
DESPITE THEIR TRAINING IN

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:19.635
CIVILIZATION I COULD NO LONGER

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:22.237
DEPEND ON THE SOLACE OF FAMILY

01:12:22.304 --> 01:12:22.871
OR COMMUNITY. LIKE

01:12:22.938 --> 01:12:24.707
INSTITUTIONALIZED EX PRISONERS

01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:27.042
MANY FORMER STUDENTS STRUGGLED

01:12:27.109 --> 01:12:28.911
OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF THE PRISON

01:12:28.977 --> 01:12:29.978
. SOME STUDENTS PAID THE

01:12:30.045 --> 01:12:31.613
ULTIMATE PRICE AND DIED ALONE AT

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.515
SHERMAN. AWAY FROM THEIR

01:12:33.582 --> 01:12:35.250
FAMILIES AND THEIR COMMUNITIES.

01:12:35.317 --> 01:12:37.386
AND AS A PARENT MYSELF I CAN'T

01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:40.756
IMAGINE THAT THAT KIND OF PAIN.

01:12:40.823 --> 01:12:42.891
OF WE KEEP GOING. NEXT SLIDE

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:47.062
PLEASE. SO WHAT CHANGED

01:12:47.129 --> 01:12:49.098
OBVIOUSLY SHERMAN TODAY IS MUCH

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:51.266
DIFFERENT THAN SHERMAN BEFORE

01:12:51.333 --> 01:12:53.135
OTHERS A LOT OF FACTORS HERE SO

01:12:53.202 --> 01:12:54.636
OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT POLICY

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:56.772
CHANGES THERE'S SERIES OF POLICY

01:12:56.839 --> 01:12:58.874
CHANGES THAT THAT EFFECTIVENESS

01:12:58.941 --> 01:13:01.243
OF THOSE PROCEDURES NEED OF

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:03.679
ACTIVISM A TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY

01:13:03.746 --> 01:13:08.083
TRIBAL SUPPORT INCLUDING- LOCAL

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:10.252
TRIBES AND- INSTITUTIONAL AND

01:13:10.319 --> 01:13:11.754
COMMUNITY RECOGNITION SO THIS IS

01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.222
SOMETHING OF COURSE THAT'S

01:13:13.288 --> 01:13:16.158
ONGOING AND- I LIKE TO THINK OF.

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:17.493
YOU KNOW SHERMAN OF THEN AND NOW

01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:19.461
AS A KIND OF THE PIVOT POINT I

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:20.963
THINK AFTER THE AFTER THE EVENTS

01:13:21.029 --> 01:13:22.564
OF THE SIXTIES IN THE CIVIL

01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:23.398
RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND THEN ALL

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:24.399
THESE EXPRESSIONS OF NATIVE

01:13:24.466 --> 01:13:26.935
SOVEREIGNTY TRIBAL SUPPORT- A

01:13:27.002 --> 01:13:28.103
LOT OF THESE FORMER STUDENTS

01:13:28.170 --> 01:13:29.838
CAME BACK TO SHERMAN AND THAT'S

01:13:29.905 --> 01:13:31.206
WHERE YOU SEE THE REAL CHANGE

01:13:31.273 --> 01:13:32.741
THE SEACHANGE OF ALL THE NATIVE

01:13:32.808 --> 01:13:34.476
STUDENTS CAME BACK TEACHING. AND

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:35.711
EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THE STUFF

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:37.479
YOU KNOW SOME OF THE TEACHERS

01:13:37.546 --> 01:13:39.281
MIGHT HAVE BEEN STILL SOMEWHAT

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:40.082
PRO ASSIMILATION IT'S IMPORTANT

01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:41.683
TO SEE YOUR OWN FACE AS AN

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:42.885
AUTHORITY FIGURE ESPECIALLY IF

01:13:42.951 --> 01:13:44.520
YOU'RE AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY AND

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:46.555
SO I THINK WE CAN LOOK AT ALL

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:47.556
THIS BUT YOU KNOW THERE'S A

01:13:47.623 --> 01:13:50.626
HANDFUL OF EXCEPTIONAL TEACHERS

01:13:50.692 --> 01:13:51.760
AND THEN JUST. YOU KNOW LOTS OF

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:53.428
HOUSE STAFF AND OTHER KINDS OF.

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:54.463
I THOUGHT SHERMAN. THAT HAVE

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:55.998
MADE ALL THE- IN CHANGE. THE

01:13:56.064 --> 01:13:56.765
PROGRAMMING OF SHERMAN. THE

01:13:56.832 --> 01:13:58.267
ATTITUDE OF THE STUDENTS. AND

01:13:58.333 --> 01:13:59.601
ALSO AFFECTS WHO COMES TO

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:01.236
SHERMAN SO NOW COURSE. BACK IN

01:14:01.303 --> 01:14:02.704
THE DAY IT WAS LIMITED TO TRAIN

01:14:02.771 --> 01:14:04.106
TRAVEL HORSE TRAVELING FROM

01:14:04.173 --> 01:14:05.707
WHOEVER CAN GET TO SHERMAN. BUT

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:07.409
NOW YOU KNOW WITH THE FLYING YOU

01:14:07.476 --> 01:14:09.144
COULD WE HAVE STUDENTS FROM

01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:09.945
ALASKA. STUDENTS FROM BACCHAE

01:14:10.012 --> 01:14:11.680
STUDENTS THAT. FOR A VARIETY OF

01:14:11.747 --> 01:14:13.382
REASONS COME BECAUSE THEIR

01:14:13.448 --> 01:14:14.449
GRANDPARENTS CAME THEIR FATHERS

01:14:14.516 --> 01:14:16.852
CAME- THEY WANT TO SEE THE BEACH

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:17.619
THEY THINK WE'RE CLOSE TO

01:14:17.686 --> 01:14:19.521
HOLLYWOOD. KIND OF. THEY WANT

01:14:19.588 --> 01:14:21.123
COULD DISNEYLAND THERE'S LOTS OF

01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:23.325
DIFFERENT REASONS. BUT OBVIOUSLY

01:14:23.392 --> 01:14:24.560
SHERMAN TODAY LOOKS MUCH

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:27.796

DRESSED IN VICTORIAN DRESS IS

01:14:37.773 --> 01:14:39.508
SOMETHING A LOT DIFFERENT. SO WE

01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:40.709
THEY HAVE TO ACTUALLY TO

01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:41.710

REPRESENTATIVE. AND I THINK

01:19:00.435 --> 01:19:02.370
ABOUT THE LASTING LEGACY NOT

01:19:02.437 --> 01:19:04.106
JUST ON CALIFORNIA INDIAN

01:19:04.172 --> 01:19:06.208
CHILDREN IN THE K. THROUGH

01:19:06.274 --> 01:19:08.777
TWELVE SYSTEM. BUT ALSO GO

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:11.680
DIFFERENTLY- NON INDIANS WHO ARE

01:19:11.746 --> 01:19:14.483
IN THE EXACT SAME EDUCATIONAL

01:19:14.549 --> 01:19:16.084
SYSTEM- AND SO WHEN WE TALK

01:19:16.151 --> 01:19:18.420
ABOUT THE FOURTH GRADE- MOST OF

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:20.856
YOU WHO ARE BORN OR WHO WERE

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:22.991
RAISED IN CALIFORNIA MIGHT

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:24.392
RECALL THE FOURTH GRADE MISSION

01:19:24.459 --> 01:19:26.094
UNIT AND THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID

01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:27.295
SPECIFICALLY REFERENCING AND

01:19:27.362 --> 01:19:28.763
THIS QUOTE. AND SO TO REALLY

01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:30.665
THINK ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH

01:19:30.732 --> 01:19:34.069
NATIVE PEOPLE NATIVE CULTURES

01:19:34.136 --> 01:19:36.071
EXPERIENCES ARE EITHER

01:19:36.138 --> 01:19:38.840
COMPLETELY ABSENT OR WHEN THEY

01:19:38.907 --> 01:19:43.411
ARE TAUGHT REALLY LACK THE

01:19:43.478 --> 01:19:46.081
NUANCE THE SPECIFIC- ITS TIES. I

01:19:46.148 --> 01:19:48.783
MIGHT BE SPECIFICALLY BROAD AND

01:19:48.850 --> 01:19:50.819
HOW WE CAN PERHAPS MOVE TO

01:19:50.886 --> 01:19:53.555
IMPROVE- THE K. TO TWELVE AND

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:56.358
EVEN INTO COLLEGES AND

01:19:56.424 --> 01:19:58.426
UNIVERSITIES. THE WAY IS THAT A

01:19:58.493 --> 01:20:00.629
NATIVE HISTORIES ARE TAUGHT. I

01:20:00.695 --> 01:20:03.198
ALSO WANT TO SHARE OF THIS IS A

01:20:03.265 --> 01:20:04.533
QUOTE FROM LEANNE SIMPSON SO

01:20:04.599 --> 01:20:07.569
SHE'S MISSION KNOBS- FROM CANADA

01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:09.571
SHE'S A POET AND SO AN ACADEMIC

01:20:09.638 --> 01:20:11.873
AND SO SHE- AND THIS QUOTE WHERE

01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:13.041
SHE'S DISCUSSING LAND AS

01:20:13.108 --> 01:20:14.876
PEDAGOGY I THINK IT'S VERY

01:20:14.943 --> 01:20:17.812
REPRESENTATIVE- TO DESCRIBE HOW

01:20:17.879 --> 01:20:20.382
MANY NATIVE PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT

01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:22.350
SORT OF GOING THROUGH THE K.

01:20:22.417 --> 01:20:24.119
THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM- SO I'M

01:20:24.186 --> 01:20:26.354
NOT GOING TO READ IT IN ITS

01:20:26.421 --> 01:20:27.289
ENTIRETY. BUT I WANT TO

01:20:27.355 --> 01:20:28.924
HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS IN

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:31.893
THIS RATE- SHE DISCUSSES AND

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.295
ASSERTS NO ONE EVER ASKED ME

01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:35.630
WHAT I WAS INTERESTED IN NOR DID

01:20:35.697 --> 01:20:37.966
THEY ASK FOR MY CONSENT TO

01:20:38.033 --> 01:20:39.734
PARTICIPATE. IN THEIR SYSTEM

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:41.670
EXPERIENCE OF EDUCATION WAS ONE

01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:42.938
OF CONTINUALLY BEING MEASURED

01:20:43.004 --> 01:20:45.040
AGAINST A SET OF PRINCIPLES THAT

01:20:45.106 --> 01:20:47.309
REQUIRES SURRENDER TO AN

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:49.644
ASSIMILATIVE COLONIAL AGENDA IN

01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:52.447
ORDER TO FULFILL THOSE

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:54.049
PRINCIPLES. COMING INTO WISDOM

01:20:54.115 --> 01:20:55.817
IT TAKES IN THE CONTEXT OF

01:20:55.884 --> 01:20:59.154
FAMILY COMMUNITY AND RELATIONS.

01:20:59.221 --> 01:21:01.389
THE LAND IS BOTH CONTEXT AND

01:21:01.456 --> 01:21:04.159
PROCESS. AND SO SHE'S OUTLINED

01:21:04.226 --> 01:21:06.695
IN DESCRIBING UPON HOUSE HER

01:21:06.761 --> 01:21:08.430
REFLECTIONS OF NOT ONLY K.

01:21:08.496 --> 01:21:09.698
THROUGH TWELVE BUT ALSO HER

01:21:09.764 --> 01:21:12.300
EXPERIENCES GOING INTO A

01:21:12.367 --> 01:21:15.136
COLLEGE. NOW I ALSO WANT TO

01:21:15.203 --> 01:21:16.571
HIGHLIGHT AN INDIVIDUAL IN THIS

01:21:16.638 --> 01:21:19.007
IS WHO I- AND HIS ORGANIZATION

01:21:19.074 --> 01:21:20.842
THAT I WROTE MY DISSERTATION ON

01:21:20.909 --> 01:21:22.944
IT SO THIS IS REPORT COSTA AND

01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:26.715
SO HE- WAS KOREA I HE WAS- FROM

01:21:26.781 --> 01:21:29.618
THE CLEAR RESERVATION AND HE-

01:21:29.684 --> 01:21:30.685
WAS A CO FOUNDER OF AN

01:21:30.752 --> 01:21:32.520
ORGANIZATION AND CALLED THE

01:21:32.587 --> 01:21:33.822
AMERICAN INDIAN HISTORICAL

01:21:33.888 --> 01:21:37.559
SOCIETY- AND SO HIS ORGANIZATION

01:21:37.626 --> 01:21:40.996
WAS. FORMALLY FOUNDED IN

01:21:41.062 --> 01:21:41.630
NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR ONE OF THE

01:21:41.696 --> 01:21:43.365
FIRST SORT OF KEY THINGS THAT

01:21:43.431 --> 01:21:45.433
THE SOCIETY EXAMINED AND LOOKED

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.736
AT WAS LOOKING AT THE TEXT BOOKS

01:21:47.802 --> 01:21:49.571
THAT WERE BEING USED IN THE

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:51.673
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS

01:21:51.740 --> 01:21:54.576
AND WHILE RUPERT HIMSELF WAS NOT

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:55.910
A TRAINED HISTORIAN HE

01:21:55.977 --> 01:21:58.446
RECOGNIZED ALONG WITH- THE

01:21:58.513 --> 01:22:00.015
ORGANIZATION THE IMPORT OF

01:22:00.081 --> 01:22:02.450
HISTORY. THE IMPORT OF WHAT IS

01:22:02.517 --> 01:22:04.853
BEING TAUGHT THE IMPORT OF THE

01:22:04.919 --> 01:22:09.724
ENVIRONMENT- THAT NEEDED

01:22:09.791 --> 01:22:10.692
CHILDREN WERE BEING EXPOSED TO.

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:12.027
SPECIFICALLY IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS

01:22:12.093 --> 01:22:13.828
BUT HE ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERN

01:22:13.895 --> 01:22:15.563
ABOUT THE IMPACT THATTHIS WAS

01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:18.033
HAVING ON NON NATIVE CHILDREN

01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:20.201
RIGHT SO- THE IDEA OF TEXTBOOKS

01:22:20.268 --> 01:22:22.237
AND LESSON PLANS THAT THEY ARE

01:22:22.304 --> 01:22:25.273
SOCIALIZING. BOTH NATIVE AND NON

01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:27.208
NATIVE CHILDREN ABOUT HOW TO

01:22:27.275 --> 01:22:29.744
PERCEIVE AND THINK ABOUT- NATIVE

01:22:29.811 --> 01:22:32.013
CULTURES BROADLY NATIVE PEOPLE

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:34.649
BROADLY. AND HE HE WOULD- VERY

01:22:34.716 --> 01:22:36.751
MUCH REGULARLY ARTICULATE THAT

01:22:36.818 --> 01:22:39.254
YOU CANNOT EXPECT GREATER SORT

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:43.024
OF SOCIETAL PERHAPS- SHIFTS OR

01:22:43.091 --> 01:22:46.127
CHANGES. IF FOLKS SIMPLY DO NOT

01:22:46.194 --> 01:22:48.363
HAVE ANY CONCEPT ABOUT NATIVE

01:22:48.430 --> 01:22:50.332
PEOPLE NEEDED HIS TREES NATIVE

01:22:50.398 --> 01:22:53.101
EXPERIENCES OR NATIVE VOICES AND

01:22:53.168 --> 01:22:54.969
SO- THIS PARTICULAR QUOTE COMES

01:22:55.036 --> 01:22:57.105
FROM A BOOK THAT HE CO WROTE

01:22:57.172 --> 01:22:58.807
WITH HIS WIFE JANET HENRY

01:22:58.873 --> 01:23:01.976
ACOSTA. SO HE'S DISCUSSING- HOW

01:23:02.043 --> 01:23:04.913
IN HIS OPINION EVERY SOCIETY

01:23:04.979 --> 01:23:06.748
QUOTE HAS EDUCATED ITS YOUNG

01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:08.850
ACCORDING TO THE BEST INTERESTS

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:11.386
OF ITS DOMINANT CLASS PERHAPS

01:23:11.453 --> 01:23:13.655
THIS CAN CHANGE AND HUMANITY

01:23:13.722 --> 01:23:15.657
BEING MADE TO SEE ITSELF FACE TO

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:18.126
FACE WITHOUT FEAR AND IN SPITE

01:23:18.193 --> 01:23:20.228
OF THE PANGS OF CONSCIENCE. AND

01:23:20.295 --> 01:23:23.732
SO AGAIN WHAT THE SOCIETY VERY

01:23:23.798 --> 01:23:25.900
MUCH SPOKE TO. IS THE IDEA OF

01:23:25.967 --> 01:23:27.969
THE IMPACT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS NOW

01:23:28.036 --> 01:23:30.438
REPORT HIMSELF WAS A PRODUCT OF

01:23:30.505 --> 01:23:32.640
PUBLIC SCHOOLS- HIS SIBLINGS

01:23:32.707 --> 01:23:34.609
WERE THE PRODUCTS OF PUBLIC

01:23:34.676 --> 01:23:37.746
SCHOOLS AND SPECIFICALLY-

01:23:37.812 --> 01:23:40.281
CERTAINLY THERE IS A LASTING

01:23:40.348 --> 01:23:43.151
LEGACY OF BOARDING SCHOOLS AGAIN

01:23:43.218 --> 01:23:45.887
MOST NATIVE PEOPLE DEPENDING ON

01:23:45.954 --> 01:23:48.022
ONE'S AGE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:23:48.089 --> 01:23:50.191
THEIR GRANDPARENTS THEIR GREAT

01:23:50.258 --> 01:23:52.660
GRANDPARENTS- PERHAPS THEIR

01:23:52.727 --> 01:23:56.531
PARENTS- WERE FORCED TO ATTEND

01:23:56.598 --> 01:23:58.233
BOARDING SCHOOLS HOWEVER

01:23:58.299 --> 01:24:01.569
SPECIFICALLY IN CALIFORNIA-

01:24:01.636 --> 01:24:03.138
THERE WAS A SHIFT WHERE THE

01:24:03.204 --> 01:24:05.273
MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA INDIAN

01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:07.575
CHILDREN WERE ATTENDING PUBLIC

01:24:07.642 --> 01:24:09.911
SCHOOLS- BUT I WANT TO BE VERY

01:24:09.978 --> 01:24:11.646
CLEAR THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE ONE

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:13.948
HAD ACCESS TO ATTEND PUBLIC

01:24:14.015 --> 01:24:16.017
SCHOOLS. DID NOT NECESSARILY

01:24:16.084 --> 01:24:19.487
TRANSLATE INTO EQUITY- WHEN IT

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:21.689
CAME TO WHAT WAS POSSIBLE AT

01:24:21.756 --> 01:24:24.526
PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND SO THE NEXT

01:24:24.592 --> 01:24:26.261
FEW SLIDES I'M GOING TO DISCUSS

01:24:26.327 --> 01:24:28.129
SOME OF THE FRAMING- OF

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:31.299
INDIVIDUALS INVOLVED IN

01:24:31.366 --> 01:24:32.700
SCHOOLING FOR NATIVE CHILDREN.

01:24:32.767 --> 01:24:34.235
SO THIS IS A QUOTE- BY THE

01:24:34.302 --> 01:24:36.571
INDIAN AGENT FROM ROUND VALLEY-

01:24:36.638 --> 01:24:40.074
THIS IS A HE WROTE- IN EIGHTEEN

01:24:40.141 --> 01:24:42.477
EIGHTY FOUR SO THIS IS PRIOR TO-

01:24:42.544 --> 01:24:44.512
SORT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS BUT IT TO

01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:45.980
THE REALLY PAY ATTENTION TO THE

01:24:46.047 --> 01:24:48.650
SCHOOL THIS REPORT- AND SO HE

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:50.552
NOTED IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR AT

01:24:50.618 --> 01:24:52.387
THAT QUOTE LITTLE PROGRESS CAN

01:24:52.454 --> 01:24:54.255
BE MADE. IN THEIR EDUCATION

01:24:54.322 --> 01:24:56.124
WHILE THEY'RE ALLOWED TO RUN IN

01:24:56.191 --> 01:24:58.560
THE CAMP SUBJECT TO THE TAUNTS

01:24:58.626 --> 01:25:00.829
AND JEERS OF THE OLD AND THE

01:25:00.895 --> 01:25:03.465
CONTAMINATIONS OF THE YOUNGER

01:25:03.531 --> 01:25:06.434
AND MIDDLE AGED NOW WHAT AGENT

01:25:06.501 --> 01:25:08.369
SHELDON WAS REFERENCING IS THAT

01:25:08.436 --> 01:25:10.839
HE WAS A FIRM BELIEVER. IN

01:25:10.905 --> 01:25:12.574
BOARDING SCHOOLS HE FIRMLY

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.209
BELIEVES THAT THE ROOF PHYSICAL

01:25:14.275 --> 01:25:16.344
REMOVAL OF CHILDREN WAS

01:25:16.411 --> 01:25:20.482
NECESSARY- IN ORDER TO- REALLY

01:25:20.548 --> 01:25:22.484
SORT OF MEET THAT GOAL OF

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:24.252
ASSIMILATION SO WHEN YOU'RE

01:25:24.319 --> 01:25:25.920
TALKING ABOUT BOARDING SCHOOLS

01:25:25.987 --> 01:25:30.325
PRIMARILY- THEY SERVED AS- A

01:25:30.391 --> 01:25:32.560
COLONIAL ASSIMILATIONIST TACTIC

01:25:32.627 --> 01:25:34.062
GREAT. HOW CAN YOU REMOVE

01:25:34.128 --> 01:25:35.430
CULTURE HOW CAN YOU REMOVE

01:25:35.497 --> 01:25:37.499
CONNECTION CAN YOU REMOVE

01:25:37.565 --> 01:25:40.702
KINSHIP- AND HE GREAT SO HE HE

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:42.604
HE'S SPEAKING AND REFERENCING IN

01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:44.639
THIS GOVERNMENT REPORT ALSO IN A

01:25:44.706 --> 01:25:46.674
VERY PATERNALISTIC MANNER HE'S

01:25:46.741 --> 01:25:48.610
TALKING ABOUT THE IDEA OF

01:25:48.676 --> 01:25:50.745
CONTAMINATIONS. THIS IS THE

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:52.480
REASON THAT WE HAVE TO REMOVE

01:25:52.547 --> 01:25:53.948
THE CHILDREN FROM I'M

01:25:54.015 --> 01:25:55.483
RESERVATIONS BECAUSE THEY COULD

01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:58.419
BE CONTAMINATED- YOU KNOW LITTLE

01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:00.455
PROGRESS CAN BE MADE AND I'VE

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:02.323
BEEN SHARING THIS QUOTE TO HAVE

01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:05.493
TO PRESENT- YOU KNOW THE SORT OF

01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.161
THE MINDSET- WHEN IT CAME TO

01:26:07.228 --> 01:26:08.796
SORT OF FORMAL EDUCATION OF

01:26:08.863 --> 01:26:10.632
CALIFORNIA INDIAN CHILDREN. SO

01:26:10.698 --> 01:26:11.366
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:26:11.432 --> 01:26:13.001
EDUCATION FOR CALIFORNIA AND ITS

01:26:13.067 --> 01:26:14.235
CHILDREN THERE REALLY CAN BE

01:26:14.302 --> 01:26:16.237
DIVIDED INTO ROUGHLY THREE

01:26:16.304 --> 01:26:18.606
DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS- SO YOU

01:26:18.673 --> 01:26:19.707
KNOW BETWEEN THIS THE BEGINNING

01:26:19.774 --> 01:26:22.944
OF STATEHOOD- TO ROUGHLY

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:25.980
NINETEEN SIXTY. AT NINETEEN

01:26:26.047 --> 01:26:27.181
SIXTEEN CALIFORNIA INDIAN CATION

01:26:27.248 --> 01:26:28.616
EXISTED PRIMARILY THROUGH

01:26:28.683 --> 01:26:30.852
FEDERAL BOARDING SCHOOLS- BASED

01:26:30.919 --> 01:26:34.022
SCHOOLS AND SOME CONTRACTS- WITH

01:26:34.088 --> 01:26:36.057
LARGELY RELIGIOUS- PRIMARILY

01:26:36.124 --> 01:26:41.829
CATHOLIC SCHOOLS- REALLY WHEN

01:26:41.896 --> 01:26:42.397
YOU'RE THEN I'M SPEAKING TO-

01:26:42.463 --> 01:26:44.098
WHAT THE PREVIOUS PRESENTATION

01:26:44.165 --> 01:26:46.167
MENTIONED I WHICH WAS THE-

01:26:46.234 --> 01:26:49.637
SECTION SIXTEEN SIXTY TWO IN

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:50.238
CALIFORNIA. THIS IS WHAT WAS

01:26:50.305 --> 01:26:51.539
UTILIZED TO EXCLUDE NATIVE

01:26:51.606 --> 01:26:53.474
CHILDREN FROM ATTENDING REGULAR

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:57.278
SCHOOLS- AND SO YOU THEN HAVE.

01:26:57.345 --> 01:26:58.980
TO ASK YOU THINK- THE THIRD

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:00.682
PERIOD WHICH IS- I'M GONNA TALK

01:27:00.748 --> 01:27:02.417
ABOUT IT IN A COUPLE OF SLIDES-

01:27:02.483 --> 01:27:03.651
WHICH IS AFTER THE PAPER

01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:06.387
DECISION- BUT THIS IS AN ADDRESS

01:27:06.454 --> 01:27:08.122
THAT WAS WRITTEN BY- THE

01:27:08.189 --> 01:27:09.057
CALIFORNIA STATE SUPERINTENDENT

01:27:09.123 --> 01:27:10.725
OF PUBLIC EDUCATION EDWARD HYATT

01:27:10.792 --> 01:27:13.528
AT THE TIME- THIS WAS A SPEECH

01:27:13.595 --> 01:27:17.532
THAT HE GAVE- AND- HE- IS

01:27:17.599 --> 01:27:19.500
ASSERTED IN HIS SPEECH QUOTE THE

01:27:19.567 --> 01:27:21.736
BEST SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM. IS

01:27:21.803 --> 01:27:22.904
FOR THE INDIAN CHILDREN TO BE

01:27:22.971 --> 01:27:25.106
SQUARELY TAKEN INTO OUR ORDINARY

01:27:25.173 --> 01:27:27.075
STATES TRICKS SCHOOLS AND TAUGHT

01:27:27.141 --> 01:27:29.110
BY THE SAME TEACHERS IN TE SAME

01:27:29.177 --> 01:27:33.214
WAY AS OTHER CHILDREN. SO IN

01:27:33.281 --> 01:27:33.681
NINETEEN FOURTEEN THAT

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:34.816
SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC

01:27:34.882 --> 01:27:37.118
INSTRUCTION IS REALLY PUSHING

01:27:37.185 --> 01:27:39.420
FOR THIS IDEA OF TO A DEGREE

01:27:39.487 --> 01:27:42.357
INTEGRATION. HOWEVER HE TEMPERS

01:27:42.423 --> 01:27:45.593
HIS COMMENT- BY NOTING THAT ONLY

01:27:45.660 --> 01:27:47.795
POSITIVE RESULTS COULD BE

01:27:47.862 --> 01:27:51.265
POSSIBLE. AKIF QUOTE WHEN EVER

01:27:51.332 --> 01:27:53.334
INDIAN CHILDREN ARE FEW AS

01:27:53.401 --> 01:27:55.703
COMPARED WITH THE WHITES AND SO

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:57.772
WHAT HE'S ARGUING IN THE SPEECH

01:27:57.839 --> 01:27:59.807
IS THAT WHILE INTEGRATION COULD

01:27:59.874 --> 01:28:02.310
PERHAPS BE POSSIBLE THAT AGAIN

01:28:02.377 --> 01:28:05.780
IT IS ONLY- PERHAPS- YOU KNOW

01:28:05.847 --> 01:28:08.483
ASSIMILATIONIST. IF NEEDED

01:28:08.549 --> 01:28:10.151
CHILDREN ARE IN THE MINORITY

01:28:10.218 --> 01:28:12.120
POPULATION- YOU ALSO HAVE LATER

01:28:12.186 --> 01:28:13.988
ON GOVERNMENT REPORTS THAT ARE

01:28:14.055 --> 01:28:16.524
DOCUMENTING ONE OF THE CAUSES

01:28:16.591 --> 01:28:18.926
THAT A LOT OF- WHITE PARENTS ARE

01:28:18.993 --> 01:28:20.828
CONCERNED ABOUT INTEGRATION IS

01:28:20.895 --> 01:28:22.363
THAT THEY'RE WORRIED THAT THEIR

01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:23.698
CHILDREN ARE PERHAPS GOING TO

01:28:23.765 --> 01:28:25.333
BEGIN. I'M DATING OR HAVING

01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:27.669
ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH-

01:28:27.735 --> 01:28:29.904
INDIAN TEENAGERS- AND SO HIS IS

01:28:29.971 --> 01:28:31.806
SORT OF WHAT IS MOTIVATING SOME

01:28:31.873 --> 01:28:33.775
OF THESE- IDEOLOGIES THAT ARE

01:28:33.841 --> 01:28:37.512
BEING HELD- SO IT'S VERY ANTI

01:28:37.578 --> 01:28:38.646
INDIAN AT SOME. SO AGAIN TO

01:28:38.713 --> 01:28:40.815
HIGHLIGHT THE SHIFT BEGINS TO

01:28:40.882 --> 01:28:42.183
OCCUR SPECIFICALLY IN

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:44.485
CALIFORNIA- THIS DATA COMES FROM

01:28:44.552 --> 01:28:46.454
THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE

01:28:46.521 --> 01:28:47.955

TO THE SECRETARY OF THE

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:50.525
INTERIOR. SO YOU CAN SEE

01:28:50.591 --> 01:28:51.993
OUTLINED RATE IN NINETEEN

01:28:52.060 --> 01:28:54.529
FIFTEEN- THAT THERE ARE ONLY

01:28:54.595 --> 01:28:55.296
THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN

01:28:55.363 --> 01:28:57.165
CALIFORNIA INDIAN STUDENTS-

01:28:57.231 --> 01:28:58.866
BASED ON THE DATA THAT'S

01:28:58.933 --> 01:29:00.601
AVAILABLE BECAUSE THAT COULD BE-

01:29:00.668 --> 01:29:02.670
GREAT- DOCUMENTS CAN SOMETIMES

01:29:02.737 --> 01:29:05.740
BE WRONG- BUT THREE HUNDRED AND

01:29:05.807 --> 01:29:08.409
SIXTEEN BY NINETEEN SIXTEEN IT'S

01:29:08.476 --> 01:29:09.711
ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND

01:29:09.777 --> 01:29:11.379
SIXTY NINE. IN NINETEEN

01:29:11.446 --> 01:29:12.947
SEVENTEEN IT'S ONE THOUSAND FIVE

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:15.216

REMAINDER OF THE TWENTIETH

01:29:18.986 --> 01:29:20.822
CENTURY- THE MAJORITY OF

01:29:20.888 --> 01:29:22.256
CALIFORNIA INDIAN STUDENTS ARE

01:29:22.323 --> 01:29:24.525
ATTENDING PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND SO

01:29:24.592 --> 01:29:26.360
IT WAS ONE THOUSAND EIGHT

01:29:26.427 --> 01:29:29.230
HUNDRED AND TWENTY IN COMPARISON

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:30.364
TO ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED

01:29:30.431 --> 01:29:32.233
AND FORTY FIVE AND SO NINETEEN

01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:33.701
EIGHTEEN IS THAT THAT YEAR THAT

01:29:33.768 --> 01:29:35.236
THAT OCCURS. SO THE PAPER

01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:38.239
DECISION IS LARGELY- CELEBRATED

01:29:38.306 --> 01:29:40.842
THOUGH ODDLY NOT KNOWN BUT A LOT

01:29:40.908 --> 01:29:43.244

AND AN INDIAN DAY SCHOOL- NEARBY

01:30:15.710 --> 01:30:18.412

WITH ALL DELIBERATE SPEED AND SO

01:30:48.309 --> 01:30:50.077
THIS MEANT THAT FOR ACTUALLY

THERE'S ALSO A SERIES OF

LONG TIME DEEP ROOTED PREJUDICES

CAN SHARE WITH FOLKS YOU CAN

01:34:32.566 --> 01:34:34.235
WATCH IT A LITTLE LATER ON- BUT

01:34:34.301 --> 01:34:35.436
I'M GOING TO HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE

01:34:35.503 --> 01:34:37.238
OF BOOKS THAT SOCIETY TARGETED

01:34:37.304 --> 01:34:39.473
AND SO ONE AT THE TIME PERIOD. A

01:34:39.540 --> 01:34:41.242
CALIFORNIA HAD THE STATE

01:34:41.308 --> 01:34:42.743
PRINTING PRESS AND SO ALL THE

01:34:42.810 --> 01:34:44.445
BOOKS ARE THE SAME THROUGHOUT

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:46.981
THE ENTIRE STATE- AND SO THEY

01:34:47.048 --> 01:34:48.716
LOOK AT HELEN BOWERS CALIFORNIA

01:34:48.783 --> 01:34:51.018
GOLD DAYS THIS WAS UTILIZED IN

01:34:51.085 --> 01:34:52.186
THE NINETEEN FIFTIES AND THE

01:34:52.253 --> 01:34:54.555
NINETEEN SIXTIES- AND SO YOU CAN

01:34:54.622 --> 01:34:56.057
SEE HOW SHE'S TALKING ABOUT THE

01:34:56.123 --> 01:34:58.926
GOLD RUSH- SHE ALSO INCLUDES

01:34:58.993 --> 01:35:00.694
THIS QUOTE WERE THOSE INDIANS

01:35:00.761 --> 01:35:01.762
HIDING BEHIND THOSE THICK

01:35:01.829 --> 01:35:04.965
BUSHES- AND SO THE CHALLENGE

01:35:05.032 --> 01:35:07.101
THIS BOOK. HOWEVER THE STATE

01:35:07.168 --> 01:35:08.335
DETERMINED THAT THIS BOOK WAS

01:35:08.402 --> 01:35:11.405
FINE FOR A CONTINUED USE. THE

01:35:11.472 --> 01:35:13.908
SOCIETY ALSO WORKED ON- A BOOK

01:35:13.974 --> 01:35:15.810
CALLED THE LAND OF FOLKS THIS

01:35:15.876 --> 01:35:17.478
WAS WRITTEN BY JAMES HARLOW THIS

01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:18.846
WAS USED IN THE OAKLAND UNIFIED

01:35:18.913 --> 01:35:23.517
SCHOOL DISTRICT WHAT WHICH WAS-

01:35:23.584 --> 01:35:24.718
RELOCATED- IT SELECTED BY THE

01:35:24.785 --> 01:35:26.053
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR OUT OF

01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:27.521
STATE INDIANS TO MOVE TO

01:35:27.588 --> 01:35:29.356
CALIFORNIA. THIS WAS ORIGINALLY

01:35:29.423 --> 01:35:31.492
PUBLISHED IN FIFTY THREE IT WAS

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:33.427
ALSO REPRINTED IN FIFTY FIVE AND

01:35:33.494 --> 01:35:34.929
FIFTY NINE SO IF YOU ATTENDED

01:35:34.995 --> 01:35:36.130
SCHOOLS IN OAKLAND UNIFIED

01:35:36.197 --> 01:35:37.398
SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE FIFTIES

01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:38.732
OR THE SIXTIES THERE'S A REALLY

01:35:38.799 --> 01:35:40.868
GOOD CHANCE THAT YOU USE THIS

01:35:40.935 --> 01:35:43.504
BOOK- SO HARLOW USED PHRASES IN

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:45.606
TERMS OF HIS BOOK LIKE A BIGGER

01:35:45.673 --> 01:35:47.908
INDIAN. WHICH IS A SLUR SPOOKY

01:35:47.975 --> 01:35:50.277
SONGS STRANGE LOOKING HOUSES HE

01:35:50.344 --> 01:35:52.480
ALSO COMMENTED IT QUOTE EVERY

01:35:52.546 --> 01:35:53.981
TIME YOU DIG INTO THE GROUND YOU

01:35:54.048 --> 01:35:56.851
ARE LIKELY TO BUMP INTO

01:35:56.917 --> 01:35:58.185
SOMETHING YOU COULD USE TO

01:35:58.252 --> 01:35:58.786
DECORATE YOUR HOME AT HOLLY.

01:35:58.853 --> 01:36:00.855
WHAT HE IS REFERENCING IN THAT-

01:36:00.921 --> 01:36:04.592
ARE HUMAN REMAINS SKELETONS. I'M

01:36:04.658 --> 01:36:07.895
SO THE SOCIETY ALONG WITH THE-

01:36:07.962 --> 01:36:08.896
OAKLAND AMERICAN INDIAN

01:36:08.963 --> 01:36:10.965
ASSOCIATION AS ALONG WITH THE

01:36:11.031 --> 01:36:12.266
OAKLAND INTERTRIBAL FRIENDSHIP

01:36:12.333 --> 01:36:14.335
HOUSE- REALLY WENT AFTER THIS

01:36:14.401 --> 01:36:16.971
BOOK NOW THE DISTRICT DECIDED

01:36:17.037 --> 01:36:18.839
THAT THEY DID REMOVE THIS BOOK.

01:36:18.906 --> 01:36:21.709
HOWEVER PERHAPS AND A PUBLIC WAY

01:36:21.775 --> 01:36:23.577
TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

01:36:23.644 --> 01:36:26.180
NOT ONLY THE SOCIETY BUT ALSO

01:36:26.247 --> 01:36:28.482
NEEDED PARENTS. YOU HAVE THE

01:36:28.549 --> 01:36:30.384
DIRECTOR OF A STRUCTURAL MEDIA I

01:36:30.451 --> 01:36:31.919
TELL THE OAKLAND TRIBUNE THAT

01:36:31.986 --> 01:36:33.587
THE BOOK WAS OBSOLETE I HAD

01:36:33.654 --> 01:36:34.421
ALREADY BEEN SCHEDULED TO BE

01:36:34.488 --> 01:36:36.891
REMOVED BUT THIS IS AN EXAMPLE

01:36:36.957 --> 01:36:40.194
OF- SORT OF- CREATING ALLIANCES

01:36:40.261 --> 01:36:41.395
TO HAVE BOOKS REMOVED AND TO

01:36:41.462 --> 01:36:43.130
THINK ABOUT AGAIN. THE IMPACT

01:36:43.197 --> 01:36:44.465
THAT THIS BOOK WOULD HAVE NOT

01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:46.600
ONLY ON NATIVE CHILDREN IN THE

01:36:46.667 --> 01:36:48.002
OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

01:36:48.068 --> 01:36:49.703
BUT ALSO HOW THIS IS TEACHING

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:52.139
NON NATIVE CHILDREN TO THINK

01:36:52.206 --> 01:36:54.441
ABOUT NATIVE PEOPLE- OF COURSE

01:36:54.508 --> 01:36:56.977
AGAIN MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR

01:36:57.044 --> 01:36:58.612
WITH- WHAT WAS KNOWN AS A SORT

01:36:58.679 --> 01:37:00.247
OF THE SUGAR CUBE MISSION

01:37:00.314 --> 01:37:02.216
SOMETIMES POPSICLE STICKS. I

01:37:02.283 --> 01:37:03.551
WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT IN

01:37:03.617 --> 01:37:05.886
pTHE FALL OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE

01:37:05.953 --> 01:37:07.288
STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION

01:37:07.354 --> 01:37:09.089
ANNOUNCED ITS NEW EDUCATIONAL

01:37:09.156 --> 01:37:10.090
HISTORY SOCIAL SCIENCE

01:37:10.157 --> 01:37:12.426
FRAMEWORK- BECAUSE IT DETERMINED

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:13.360
THAT THE MISSION UNIT WAS

01:37:13.427 --> 01:37:15.129
OFFENSIVE AND ACTUALLY TAUGHT

01:37:15.196 --> 01:37:17.698
LITTLE HISTORICAL OF INFORMATION

01:37:17.765 --> 01:37:19.266
ACCURATE INFORMATION AND ALSO

01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:21.402
CAN BE VERY CLEAR THAT THE IDEA

01:37:21.468 --> 01:37:23.404
OF THE DIORAMA. WAS ACTUALLY

01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:26.707
NEVER PART OF A FORMAL- STATE

01:37:26.774 --> 01:37:28.742
WIDE CURRICULUM THIS IS

01:37:28.809 --> 01:37:30.678
SOMETHING THAT- TEACHERS DID ON

01:37:30.744 --> 01:37:32.980
THEIR OWN AND IT BEGAN TO REPEAT

01:37:33.047 --> 01:37:34.715
AND THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF

01:37:34.782 --> 01:37:36.250
HOW WHAT YOU ARE EXPOSED TO

01:37:36.317 --> 01:37:38.919
YOURSELF PERHAPS LEAD YOU TO AS

01:37:38.986 --> 01:37:41.322
YOU GROW UP. AND INTO YOUR

01:37:41.388 --> 01:37:43.157
CHOSEN REFLECTION YOU BEGIN TO

01:37:43.224 --> 01:37:45.292
CONTINUE TO MIMIC THAT FOR

01:37:45.359 --> 01:37:48.095
DECADES THIS WAS A MAINSTAY IN-

01:37:48.162 --> 01:37:50.264
CALIFORNIA FOURTH GRADE- THE

01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:52.433
MISSION UNIT AND WHAT THE STATE

01:37:52.499 --> 01:37:54.368
IS NOW DOING IS REALLY EXAMINING

01:37:54.435 --> 01:37:59.373
HOW TO REVISE- AND CORRECT- WHAT

01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:01.775
SORT OF. IS TAUGHT IN PUBLIC

01:38:01.842 --> 01:38:05.212
SCHOOLS I ALSO REALLY WANT TO

01:38:05.279 --> 01:38:06.614
QUICKLY MENTION A COUPLE OF

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:10.517
INSTANCES SO IN FEBRUARY OF

01:38:10.584 --> 01:38:11.952
TWENTY. DON'T GET ELEMENTARY

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:12.953
SCHOOL A- THAT WAS SORT OF

01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:14.088
CIRCULATOR AS HOMEWORK AND SO

01:38:14.154 --> 01:38:16.023
INCLUDED THINGS LIKE QUOTE THE

01:38:16.090 --> 01:38:18.058
WOMEN WERE CALLED SCHOOL LAWS AN

01:38:18.125 --> 01:38:20.227
INDIAN WORD FOR WOMEN. OF COURSE

01:38:20.294 --> 01:38:22.463
WE KNOW THAT GIVEN THE TERM

01:38:22.529 --> 01:38:23.897
SQUAD THE WEIGHT IT PLACES ARE

01:38:23.964 --> 01:38:25.532
BEING RENAMED THIS IS ACTUALLY

01:38:25.599 --> 01:38:27.735
AN APPROPRIATE- BUT THIS IS WHAT

01:38:27.801 --> 01:38:29.270
WAS BEING UTILIZED IN THEM AND

01:38:29.336 --> 01:38:31.338
THEY ELEMENT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

01:38:31.405 --> 01:38:34.174
CLASS. LASTLY TO BRING ATTENTION

01:38:34.241 --> 01:38:36.477
TO A HANDFUL OF REPORTS ABOUT

01:38:36.543 --> 01:38:37.444
SORT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:38:37.511 --> 01:38:39.179
IMAGERY SO THE AMERICAN INDIAN

01:38:39.246 --> 01:38:41.148
COLLEGE FUND REPORT CREATING

01:38:41.215 --> 01:38:42.216
VISIBILITY NOTES THE

01:38:42.283 --> 01:38:44.285
INVISIBILITY IS IN ESSENCE HE

01:38:44.351 --> 01:38:46.420
MODERN FORM OF RACISM. USED TO

01:38:46.487 --> 01:38:47.821
GET STATE OF AMERICANS IT IS

01:38:47.888 --> 01:38:49.790
THIS INVISIBILITY THAT LEADS TO

01:38:49.857 --> 01:38:51.525
COLLEGE ACCESS AND COMPLETION

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:53.294
CRISIS AMONG NATIVE AMERICAN

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.262
STUDENTS YOU ALSO HAVE THE

01:38:55.329 --> 01:38:57.431

AMERICAN INDIANS- ENTITLED

01:38:59.199 --> 01:39:00.701
CREATING COMMUNITY. IT ARGUES

01:39:00.768 --> 01:39:02.903
THAT THERE'S IMPORTANT FACTORS

01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:05.606
FOR- NOT ONLY- COLLEGE

01:39:05.673 --> 01:39:07.408
ATTENDANCE BUT ALSO SUCCESSFUL

01:39:07.474 --> 01:39:09.276
GRADUATION SURROUNDING YOURSELF

01:39:09.343 --> 01:39:11.478
WITH COMMUNITY AND ALSO HAVING

01:39:11.545 --> 01:39:13.147
AT LEAST ONE SUPPORTIVE MENTOR

01:39:13.213 --> 01:39:15.482
OR ADVISER. LASTLY I WANT TO

01:39:15.549 --> 01:39:17.117
HIGHLIGHT BE ELIMINATED

01:39:17.184 --> 01:39:18.886
RECLAIMING NATIVE TRUTH REPORT

01:39:18.952 --> 01:39:20.154
WHICH REALLY ARTICULATES THE

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:22.456
IDEA OF NOT ONLY EDUCATION BEING

01:39:22.523 --> 01:39:25.726
A KEY LEVER FOR CHANGE ACROSS.

01:39:25.793 --> 01:39:26.727
ALL OF THIS RESEARCH IN THIS

01:39:26.794 --> 01:39:29.430
REPORT BUT ALSO A RECOGNITION

01:39:29.496 --> 01:39:31.398
THAT PEOPLE BOTH NATIVE AND

01:39:31.465 --> 01:39:33.400
NONNATIVE RECOGNIZED THAT WHAT

01:39:33.467 --> 01:39:34.635
THEY'RE BEING TAUGHT IN PUBLIC

01:39:34.702 --> 01:39:37.638
SCHOOLS IS AN ACCURATE. AND IS

01:39:37.705 --> 01:39:39.940
INDEED- A DEFICIT AND SO THIS IS

01:39:40.007 --> 01:39:42.543
A PLACE A SITE WHERE PERHAPS

01:39:42.609 --> 01:39:46.347
THERE CAN BE A CHANGE- SO. THIS

01:39:46.413 --> 01:39:48.282
IS A WRAP UP OF MY PRESENTATION

02:08:25.097 --> 02:08:26.365
QUITE OBVIOUSLY EACH IS AN

02:08:26.432 --> 02:08:27.833
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BUT OUR

02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:29.668

02:08:29.735 --> 02:08:31.537
HUNDREDS OF YEARS BEFORE CONTACT

ON THE AND THE- PRESENTATIONS.

02:08:53.258 --> 02:08:54.193
BUT THIS WOULD ESTABLISH A

02:08:54.259 --> 02:08:55.127
COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE

02:08:55.194 --> 02:08:56.328

ABOUT THIS MORNING OF CHILDREN

02:09:07.372 --> 02:09:10.609
BEING FORCIBLY REMOVED- AS WE

02:09:10.676 --> 02:09:12.578
SAW WITH SOME OF THE QUOTES.

02:09:12.644 --> 02:09:14.146
THIS MORNING ON THE

02:09:14.213 --> 02:09:15.247

02:09:15.314 --> 02:09:16.648
THAT WERE INVOLVED WITH THAT

02:09:16.715 --> 02:09:18.550
FELT THAT THAT WAS THE RIGHT

02:09:18.617 --> 02:09:21.086
THING TO DO. AND THAT THAT WAS

02:09:21.153 --> 02:09:21.587
TRYING TO CIVILIZE THESE

02:09:21.653 --> 02:09:22.988
BARBARIC PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY

02:09:23.055 --> 02:09:24.823
LOOK AT US AS INDIAN PEOPLE. SO

02:09:24.890 --> 02:09:26.258
THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S NOT

02:09:26.325 --> 02:09:28.527
JUST WHEN WE THINK ABOUT IT IS

02:09:28.594 --> 02:09:30.596
NOT JUST FIVE HUNDRED YEARS AGO

02:09:30.662 --> 02:09:33.132

GREAT GRANDPARENTS IN SOME CASES

02:09:36.935 --> 02:09:39.404

02:09:39.471 --> 02:09:44.042
THAT REALLY- HITS HOME WITH US.

02:09:44.109 --> 02:09:45.911

02:09:55.787 --> 02:09:58.190
POSTCOLONIALISM. ISN'T THIS

02:09:58.257 --> 02:09:59.758
INITIATIVE HAS THE POTENTIAL TO

RE WRITE HISTORY BOOKS AND BRING

HEALING PROCESS THIS HAS TO

02:10:34.092 --> 02:10:39.264
HAPPEN IN THAT MANNER. ONE OF

02:10:39.331 --> 02:10:40.465
THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED AT THE

02:10:40.532 --> 02:10:44.203
COUNCIL LEVEL AT THE REVEL INTO

02:10:44.269 --> 02:10:45.637
TO OUR ATTENTION WE STARTED

02:10:45.704 --> 02:10:47.372
HAVING DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MEETING

02:10:47.439 --> 02:10:49.541
WITH THE HASTINGS- FOLKS. AND

02:10:49.608 --> 02:10:51.410
COLLEGE BOOKS AND STUFF BOARD

02:10:51.476 --> 02:10:53.812
MEMBERS WAS THAT- I FELT VERY

02:10:53.879 --> 02:10:55.747
STRONGLY PERSONALLY THAT WE DO

02:10:55.814 --> 02:10:58.650
HAVE YOU FEW FOLKS THAT. CAN

02:10:58.717 --> 02:11:00.285
SPEAK ON THEIR BEHALF AND CAN

PORTRAY THE ACTOR HISTORY ON

02:11:02.521 --> 02:11:03.956

02:11:04.022 --> 02:11:07.826
COUNCIL- SANCTIONED UP COMMITTEE

02:11:07.893 --> 02:11:09.695

THE LEGACY- OR START OF JUSTICE.

02:11:13.432 --> 02:11:16.034
AND SO THAT WAS DONE BY- A

02:11:16.101 --> 02:11:17.769
COUNCIL RESOLUTION AND THE

02:11:17.836 --> 02:11:19.338
REASON I FELT VERY STRONGLY THAT

02:11:19.404 --> 02:11:22.441
IS ABOUT THAT FACT IS WE HAVE TO

02:11:22.507 --> 02:11:24.209
LADIES HERE TODAY. THAT ARE VERY

02:11:24.276 --> 02:11:27.012

02:11:28.680 --> 02:11:30.582
WILL HAPPEN TO THEM. ANNA AND

02:11:30.649 --> 02:11:33.218
THEIR STORIES SO- SO THE COUNCIL

02:11:33.285 --> 02:11:35.020
DID APPROVE THAT AND WE ARE

02:11:35.087 --> 02:11:36.722
MOVING AHEAD WITH THAT SO WE

02:11:36.788 --> 02:11:38.457
WENT THROUGH I JUST WANNA MAKE

02:11:38.523 --> 02:11:40.058
ONE QUICK QUICK COMMENT ABOUT

02:11:40.125 --> 02:11:41.126
THAT. SO WE'VE GONE THROUGH ALL

02:11:41.193 --> 02:11:45.664
OF THE- STORMING INFORMING AND

02:11:45.731 --> 02:11:47.099

THROUGH. AND SO- BUT THAT'S YOU

02:11:48.467 --> 02:11:50.235
KNOW THE WAY IT GOES AND IT

02:11:50.302 --> 02:11:51.737
TAKES A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO

02:11:51.803 --> 02:11:53.505
PULL THINGS TOGETHER. AND TO-

02:11:53.572 --> 02:11:54.339
DEFINE YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE

02:14:11.843 --> 02:14:13.612
CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY IN GENERAL.

02:14:13.678 --> 02:14:15.347
SO SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE

02:14:15.414 --> 02:14:17.682
DEAL WITH ON A DAILY BASIS AND-

02:14:17.749 --> 02:14:19.718
AND HAVE DEALT WITH FOR YEARS AS

02:14:19.785 --> 02:14:21.286
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN OUR

02:14:21.353 --> 02:14:24.890
COMMUNITY. AND- ALSO IN TERMS OF

02:14:24.956 --> 02:14:27.259
JUST COMMUNICATION- ONE OF THE

02:14:27.325 --> 02:14:29.194
THINGS THAT CAME TO OF I HAD

02:14:29.261 --> 02:14:30.729
THAT WAS VERY RELEVANT. IN THE

02:14:30.796 --> 02:14:32.464
DURING THIS PANDEMIC WAS OUR

02:14:32.531 --> 02:14:33.598
CHILDREN WERE NO LONGER ALLOWED

02:14:33.665 --> 02:14:35.600
TO GO TO SCHOOL THEY WERE TOLD

02:14:35.667 --> 02:14:38.103
TO STAY HOME AND- WERE ALLOWED

02:14:38.170 --> 02:14:40.038
TO GO INTO THE CLASSROOMS. AND

02:14:40.105 --> 02:14:41.640
SO THEN THEY WERE TOLD THAT WELL

02:14:41.706 --> 02:14:43.975
YOU CAN ZOOM IN. OUR TO VARIOUS

02:14:44.042 --> 02:14:45.811
THINGS. THE PROBLEM WE HAD WITH

02:14:45.877 --> 02:14:47.879
THAT WAS WE HAD NO ACCESS. ON A

02:14:47.946 --> 02:14:49.848
RESERVATION TO- HIGH SPEED

02:14:49.915 --> 02:14:52.317
LINES- WE HAVE ONE OUTSIDE

02:14:52.384 --> 02:14:56.121
COMPANY THAT. WAS HAD- FEW COULD

02:14:56.188 --> 02:14:58.023
OR GET HIGH SPEED INTERNET BUT

02:14:58.089 --> 02:15:01.726
IT WAS A VERY HIGH SPEED. AND SO

02:15:01.793 --> 02:15:03.028
WAS AND IT CERTAINLY WASN'T- BUT

02:15:03.094 --> 02:15:04.763
NOW IF IT WASN'T SUFFICIENT FOR

02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:06.565
OUR KIDS TO LEARN. SO WE'VE BEEN

02:15:06.631 --> 02:15:08.433
WORKING ON OUR OWN ISSUES WITHIN

02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:09.668
THE VALLEY OF TRYING TO START

02:15:09.734 --> 02:15:12.304
OUR OWN. CELL TOWER SYSTEM TO

02:15:12.370 --> 02:15:14.639
GET THOSE- UP AND RUNNING AND

02:15:14.706 --> 02:15:16.475
GET OUR KIDS TO HAVE ACCESS AND

02:15:16.541 --> 02:15:18.443
OUR FOLKS TO IN THE VALLEY TO

02:15:18.510 --> 02:15:19.744
HAVE ACCESS TO. HIGH SPEED LINE

02:15:19.811 --> 02:15:21.847
HIGH SPEED LINES ANOTHER VERY

02:15:21.913 --> 02:15:22.614
IMPORTANT ISSUE FORCES

02:15:22.681 --> 02:15:24.549
EDUCATION. AND I KNOW WE'VE

02:15:24.616 --> 02:15:26.485
HEARD A LOT ABOUT IT IN

02:15:26.551 --> 02:15:27.419
EDUCATION THERE'S A LOTOF WORK

02:15:27.486 --> 02:15:29.321
TO BE DONE. THIS IS VERY

02:15:29.387 --> 02:15:31.923
IMPORTANT FOR US. AS A TRIBE.

02:15:31.990 --> 02:15:35.093
AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD. WE HAVE

02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:38.430
ONE- LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT IN

02:15:38.497 --> 02:15:40.465
ROUND VALLEY. AND WITHIN ABOUT

02:15:40.532 --> 02:15:42.400
THE LAST FIVE YEARS- WE HAD

02:15:42.467 --> 02:15:45.036
ABOUT 80% OF OUR LOCAL SCHOOL

02:15:45.103 --> 02:15:47.038
DISTRICT WAS INDIAN KIDS. AND

02:15:47.105 --> 02:15:49.241
SO- BUT WE STILL DEAL WITH THE

02:15:49.307 --> 02:15:50.775
SAME ISSUES EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE

02:15:50.842 --> 02:15:52.577
THE LARGEST POPULATION. WE STILL

02:15:52.644 --> 02:15:53.879
DEAL WITH THE SAME ISSUES THAT

02:15:53.945 --> 02:15:55.313
YOU HEAR FROM OTHER SCHOOL

02:15:55.380 --> 02:15:57.582
DISTRICTS AS WELL. AND BASICALLY

02:15:57.649 --> 02:15:59.518
JUST TO SUM IT UP IN ONE WORD.

02:15:59.584 --> 02:16:01.219
IT'S JUST REYES RACIST IT'S

02:16:01.286 --> 02:16:03.922
BLATANT RACISM. THAT WE DEAL

02:16:03.989 --> 02:16:06.057
WITH ALMOST ON A DAILY BASIS. SO

02:16:06.124 --> 02:16:07.726
WE HAVE SOME HUGE CHALLENGES IN

02:16:07.792 --> 02:16:10.629
EDUCATION AND WE'RE WE'RE TRYING

02:16:10.695 --> 02:16:11.897
TO WORK THROUGH THEM- ANOTHER

02:16:11.963 --> 02:16:14.666
ISSUE THAT I'D LIKE TO BRING TO

02:16:14.733 --> 02:16:16.334
THE ATTENTION IS- WE DO HAVE A-

02:16:16.401 --> 02:16:17.636
RIVAL INDIAN HEALTH CENTER IF

02:16:17.702 --> 02:16:19.471
THIS LOCATED ON A RESERVATION.

02:16:19.538 --> 02:16:20.472
AND IT'S ONE OF THE OLDEST

02:16:20.539 --> 02:16:22.307
HEALTH CENTERS THAT WAS AROUND

02:16:22.374 --> 02:16:24.042
TOO STARTED IN NINETEEN SIXTY

02:16:24.109 --> 02:16:27.679
EIGHT. BUT ANYWAY- IN NIGHT IN

02:16:27.746 --> 02:16:28.580
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TWO THOUSAND

02:16:28.647 --> 02:16:29.848
AND NINE THE INDIAN HEALTH STATE

02:16:29.915 --> 02:16:31.616
IN HEALTH PROGRAM WAS CUT. FROM

02:16:31.683 --> 02:16:34.219
THE BUDGET ENTIRELY. AND SINCE

02:16:34.286 --> 02:16:35.987
THEN AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT

02:16:36.054 --> 02:16:37.956
THERE ARE HITS- DEFICIT BUDGET

02:16:38.023 --> 02:16:39.424
DEFICIT IN THE STATE NEEDED TO

02:16:39.491 --> 02:16:41.493
DO SOMETHING TO BALANCE THE

02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:43.461
BUDGET. BUT ALL OF THE PROGRAMS

02:16:43.528 --> 02:16:46.131
OTHER PROGRAMS THAT WERE CUT

02:16:46.197 --> 02:16:46.798
DURING THAT TIME WE'RE ALL HAVE

02:16:46.865 --> 02:16:48.199
ALL BEEN REINSTATED. EXCEPT FOR

02:16:48.266 --> 02:16:48.833
OUR PROGRAM. SO I KNOW THAT

02:16:48.900 --> 02:16:50.435
THERE'S BEEN A BILL AND THERE'S

02:16:50.502 --> 02:16:52.971
BEEN SOME- ADVOCACY ON THE PART

02:16:53.038 --> 02:16:54.539
OF GERMAN AROUND WE'RE ALMOST

02:16:54.606 --> 02:16:56.541
ANOTHER LEGISLATORS. TO TRY TO

02:16:56.608 --> 02:16:58.543
REINSTALL THAT PROGRAM ON IT ON

02:16:58.610 --> 02:17:00.378
AN ONGOING BASIS. SO IT'S VERY

02:17:00.445 --> 02:17:02.647
IT'S CRUCIAL TO- TO OUR ENDED

02:17:02.714 --> 02:17:05.183
HEALTH. AND TO OUR COMMUNITY SO

02:17:05.250 --> 02:17:06.151
I'D REALLY LIKE TO EMPHASIZE

02:17:06.217 --> 02:17:08.053
THAT. THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I'D

02:17:08.119 --> 02:17:09.421
LIKE TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION

02:17:09.487 --> 02:17:14.326
AS THE- MMI W. MURDERED. MISSING

02:17:14.392 --> 02:17:15.894
INDIGENOUS WOMEN. SO WE HAD SET

02:17:15.961 --> 02:17:18.797
A VERY HIGH PROFILE. CASE THAT

02:17:18.863 --> 02:17:20.465
WAS BROUGHT TO THE ATTENTION OF

02:17:20.532 --> 02:17:22.467
NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT PROBABLY

02:17:22.534 --> 02:17:25.370
THE COUNTRY. BUT IT HAD SOME

02:17:25.437 --> 02:17:27.872
WITH THE FOR US VERY- RIGHT TO

02:17:27.939 --> 02:17:29.741
THE CORE OF OUR HEART. AS WE

02:17:29.808 --> 02:17:31.610
HAD- ONE YOUNG LADY IN OUR

02:17:31.676 --> 02:17:33.578
COMMUNITY WAS BRUTALLY

02:17:33.645 --> 02:17:36.548
ASSAULTED. SHE'S RIGHT NOW IN UC

02:17:36.615 --> 02:17:38.083
DAVIS MEDICAL CENTER AND SO SHE

02:17:38.149 --> 02:17:39.718
IS JUST CLINGING TO LIFE SHE'S

02:17:39.784 --> 02:17:42.153
STILL ALIVE SELUK FORTUNATELY

02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:43.722
SHE WAS FOUND. BUT THIS IS

02:17:43.788 --> 02:17:45.523
ANOTHER THING THAT WE NEED TO

02:17:45.590 --> 02:17:46.691
BRING TO THE FOREFRONT ON BEHALF

02:17:46.758 --> 02:17:48.126
FOR INDIAN INDIGENOUS WOMEN.

02:17:48.193 --> 02:17:50.095

02:17:50.161 --> 02:17:51.529
OFTEN AND WE NEED TO COME TO

02:17:51.596 --> 02:17:53.765

02:17:53.832 --> 02:17:55.100
COLLECTIVELY TOGETHER. WITH

02:39:21.919 --> 02:39:24.254

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND- AGAIN I

02:42:22.799 --> 02:42:24.701
THINK WE COME AT A TIME IN OUR

02:42:24.768 --> 02:42:27.204
HISTORY- THAT WE HAVE TO TALK

02:42:27.270 --> 02:42:28.071
ABOUT RESTORING RESTORATIVE

02:42:28.138 --> 02:42:31.208
JUSTICE AND I THINK RESTORE

02:42:31.274 --> 02:42:33.877
RESTORE ADDRESSES LOOKS LIKE-

02:42:33.944 --> 02:42:37.414
THE NAME BEING CHANGED AND ALSO-

02:42:37.481 --> 02:42:40.450
THE NATO THE FIRST PEOPLE BEING

02:42:40.517 --> 02:42:42.085
PART OF THAT PROCESS AND THIS IS

02:42:42.152 --> 02:42:44.221
THAT PROCESS RIGHT HERE. THAT WE

02:42:44.287 --> 02:42:46.623
HAVE OPEN UP TESTIMONIES- I AM

02:42:46.690 --> 02:42:50.494
APPALLED BYE BY WHAT I HEARD-

02:42:50.560 --> 02:42:51.962
BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS REFLECTED

02:42:52.028 --> 02:42:55.298
BACK ON- YOU KNOW BLACK PEOPLE

02:42:55.365 --> 02:42:59.536
AFRICAN AMERICANS PEOPLE- IN

02:42:59.603 --> 02:43:00.470
SLAVERY AND CERTAINLY. IN THIS

02:43:00.537 --> 02:43:02.139
COUNTRY HAS A VERY CHECKERED

02:43:02.205 --> 02:43:03.507
PAST WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO

02:43:03.573 --> 02:43:06.710
PEOPLE OF COLOR BUT WE MUST BE.

02:43:06.776 --> 02:43:08.512
AT LEAST IN THE THIS POSITION AS

02:43:08.578 --> 02:43:11.348
POLICYMAKERS TRY TO RE WRITE THE

02:43:11.414 --> 02:43:15.051
WRONGS OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN

02:43:15.118 --> 02:43:17.821
THE PAST- SO THAT WE CAN MOVE ON

02:43:17.888 --> 02:43:19.956
AND I THINK THE WAY WE MOVE ON

02:43:20.023 --> 02:43:22.125
IS TO. RENAME THIS INSTITUTION

02:43:22.192 --> 02:43:24.294
AND I THINK THAT IT'S REFLECTIVE

02:43:24.361 --> 02:43:27.497
OF A COLLABORATION. OF MANY

02:43:27.564 --> 02:43:29.533
VOICES BUT MOST OF ALL OF THE

02:43:29.599 --> 02:43:31.168
FOR THE FIRST AMERICANS OF

02:43:31.234 --> 02:43:32.736
VOICES WHICH IS MOST IMPORTANT

02:43:32.802 --> 02:43:35.005
IS A NATIVE AMERICAN VOICES. OUT

02:43:35.071 --> 02:43:35.672
TO MAKING SURE THAT IS SOMETHING

02:43:35.739 --> 02:43:39.809
THAT- THEY CAN BE PROUD OF- IT

02:43:39.876 --> 02:43:41.811
CAN MAKE SURE THAT IS SOMETHING

02:43:41.878 --> 02:43:43.313
THAT THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES

02:43:43.380 --> 02:43:44.581
AND CALIFORNIA COULD BE PROUD

02:43:44.648 --> 02:43:46.483
OF. BECAUSE I THINK WE STAND AT

02:43:46.550 --> 02:43:50.620

02:53:08.811 --> 02:53:12.482
RELOCATION PROGRAM. DIDN'T WORK

02:53:12.548 --> 02:53:13.516
FOR A GREAT MAJORITY OF THE

02:53:13.583 --> 02:53:17.386
PEOPLE- EVENTUALLY EVERYONE

02:53:17.453 --> 02:53:19.522
MOVED BACK TO THE RESERVATIONS.

02:53:19.589 --> 02:53:21.924
SO ALL OF THIS MAY HAVE LEARNED

02:53:21.991 --> 02:53:24.527
A TRADE BUT COULDN'T USE THAT IF

02:53:24.594 --> 02:53:27.163
THEY GOT A JOB THAT WAS AT

02:53:27.230 --> 02:53:31.400
MINIMUM WAGE AND- WE'RE NOT ABLE

02:53:31.467 --> 02:53:33.369
TO FULLY ASSIMILATE INTO

MEDICAL CARE. THESE ARE JUST A

02:53:42.445 --> 02:53:45.481
FEW OF THE ACTIONS BY THE

02:53:45.548 --> 02:53:47.884
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND STATES

02:53:47.950 --> 02:53:50.052

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ON

02:53:51.921 --> 02:53:55.424
RESERVATIONS. UNTIL THE CABAZON

02:53:55.491 --> 02:53:59.028
DECISION. THAT STARTED GAMING

02:53:59.095 --> 02:54:01.564
EVEN IN GAMING AS I WAS THE

02:54:01.631 --> 02:54:02.899
HUMAN RESOURCE DIRECTOR I SAW

02:54:02.965 --> 02:54:05.468
THE- THE TURN AROUND THERE'S

02:54:05.535 --> 02:54:09.071
SOME OF OUR- TRIBAL MEMBERS WHO

02:54:09.138 --> 02:54:11.474
REALLY WANT TO WORK BUT- COULD

02:54:11.541 --> 02:54:14.644
NEVER GET HIRED IN ANY TOWN OR

02:54:14.710 --> 02:54:22.919
CITY. BECAUSE OF RACISM. SO. AND

02:54:22.985 --> 02:54:25.822
THEN IN ORDER TO APPLY FOR STATE

02:54:25.888 --> 02:54:27.623
ASSISTANCE. TRIBAL MEMBERS WERE

02:54:27.690 --> 02:54:29.458
NOT ALLOWED TO OWN ANYTHING

02:54:29.525 --> 02:54:32.328
WHICH IS AT LET ME HOW WE LOST A

02:54:32.395 --> 02:54:35.464
LOT OF OUR TRIBAL LANDS IF YOU

02:54:35.531 --> 02:54:39.702

02:54:43.339 --> 02:54:45.241
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE A VALUE

02:54:45.308 --> 02:54:49.812
INCLUDING CARS AND LANDS. IN

02:54:49.879 --> 02:54:51.814
ORDER TO GET FOOD STAMPS BACK

02:54:51.881 --> 02:54:54.917
DOWN OR COMMODITY FOODS THAT WAS

02:54:54.984 --> 02:55:03.726
ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN OUR GRADES ARE K. THROUGH

02:55:03.793 --> 02:55:07.597
TWELVE- EDUCATION WAS ONLY GOOD

02:55:07.663 --> 02:55:09.198
FOR TRIBAL MEMBERS THROUGH WHAT

02:55:09.265 --> 02:55:11.601
I CALL COUNT WEEK I DON'T KNOW

02:55:11.667 --> 02:55:14.203
IF ANY OF YOU. REALIZE WHAT

02:55:14.270 --> 02:55:17.707
COUNT WEEK AS- STILL DISTRICTS

02:55:17.773 --> 02:55:20.910
WERE GIVEN FUNDING BY THE STATE

02:55:20.977 --> 02:55:23.079
AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BASED ON

02:55:23.145 --> 02:55:25.882
THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS

02:55:25.948 --> 02:55:26.883
ATTENDING IN THAT SCHOOL

02:55:26.949 --> 02:55:29.685
DISTRICT. SO THEY GUARDIAN AS

02:55:29.752 --> 02:55:31.487
MANY NATIVE AMERICANS AS A

02:55:31.554 --> 02:55:33.689
CREDIT BEARING CAL POLY AND THEN

02:55:33.756 --> 02:55:35.458
DIDN'T CARE A SHOW ABOUT FOR THE

02:55:35.524 --> 02:55:39.028
REST OF THE YEAR. SO MANY NATIVE

02:55:39.095 --> 02:55:41.464
AMERICANS- WHERE EITHER

02:55:41.530 --> 02:55:48.471
DISMISSED- WE'RE- PICKED ON TO

02:55:48.537 --> 02:55:50.306
THE POINT OF GETTING IN FIGHTS

02:55:50.373 --> 02:55:52.174
AND THEN LATER DISMISSED FROM

02:55:52.241 --> 02:55:54.310
SCHOOL SO THEY COULD NEVER

02:55:54.377 --> 02:56:03.986
GRADUATE. SO THAT WAS CANNOT BE. IF YOU LOOK NOW AT THE THIRTY

02:56:04.053 --> 02:56:05.288
EIGHT TRIBAL COLLEGES IN THE

02:56:05.354 --> 02:56:07.657
UNITED STATES PARTICULARLY HERE

02:56:07.723 --> 02:56:12.795
IN CALIFORNIA- EDUCATION IS

02:56:12.862 --> 02:56:14.597
THRIVING FOR SOME OF THOSE. AND

02:56:14.664 --> 02:56:19.368

02:57:13.222 --> 02:57:18.794
AND- R. SEVENTEEN- WE TOOK TOOK

02:57:18.861 --> 02:57:21.097
A LOOK AT THE STATISTICS. NOT

02:57:21.163 --> 02:57:22.665
OUR STATISTICS BUT THE

02:57:22.732 --> 02:57:25.534

AMERICANS LIVING IN CALIFORNIA

02:57:36.379 --> 02:57:45.087

02:57:45.154 --> 02:57:46.922
THEIR OWN RECOGNITION OF BEING

02:57:46.989 --> 02:57:50.559
NATIVE AMERICAN. ARE A COLLEGE

02:57:50.626 --> 02:57:54.930
OR UNIVERSITY LESS THAN 1% SO

02:57:54.997 --> 02:57:59.902
