ASKING FOR A COUPLE YEARS THE

00:32:04.822 --> 00:32:06.591
LAST TWO THREE YEARS. AND SO

00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:07.191
THIS GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY

00:32:07.258 --> 00:32:08.826
TO MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER- OF

00:32:08.893 --> 00:32:10.228
LABOR'S BEEN A KEY BUT A

00:32:10.295 --> 00:32:11.896
PARTNER AT THE TABLE BY DOING

00:32:11.963 --> 00:32:12.630
THESE BECAUSE THE DISCUSSIONS

00:32:12.697 --> 00:32:14.432
AND CONVERSATIONS. AND I THINK

00:32:14.499 --> 00:32:16.901
THAT- WITH OF THEIR THEIR-

00:32:16.968 --> 00:32:17.769
DIFFERENT CLAIMS AS TO THE

00:32:17.835 --> 00:32:20.505
DEGREE OF- MISS CLASSIFICATION.

00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:22.073
THE DEGREE TO WHICH AN ISSUE

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.741
THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE CURRENT

00:32:23.808 --> 00:32:25.376
MODEL WORKS FOR THE INDUSTRY-

00:32:25.443 --> 00:32:26.411
BUT YOU KNOW AS FAR AS THE

00:32:26.477 --> 00:32:28.112
PUBLISHERS ARE CONCERNED. LET'S

00:32:28.179 --> 00:32:29.781
GET THAT INFORMATION SO THAT WE

00:32:29.847 --> 00:32:30.481
CAN ACTUALLY DIG A LITTLE

00:32:30.548 --> 00:32:32.917
DEEPER. RATHER THAN- KIND OF

00:32:32.984 --> 00:32:34.886
THE CHARADE OF DECIDING THESE

00:32:34.952 --> 00:32:36.287
EXTENSIONS EXTENSIONS FOR

00:32:36.354 --> 00:32:38.423
EXTENSION SAKE- I THINK WE HAVE

00:32:38.489 --> 00:32:40.725
THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY. DO

00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:41.492
SOMETHING MORE MEANINGFUL WHEN

00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:43.861

00:32:43.928 --> 00:32:45.430

00:32:45.496 --> 00:32:46.898
DIFFERENT- BUT THERE HAS TO BE

00:32:46.964 --> 00:32:48.766
THAT RECOGNITION. PARTICULARLY

00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:50.902

00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:01.079
LOSE SIGHT OF THE WORKERS AND

00:33:01.145 --> 00:33:02.413
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE ALSO

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.581

00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:05.650
