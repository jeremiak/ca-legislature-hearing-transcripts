AS WELL AS MY ASSIGNMENT PRIOR TO MY INITIAL APPOINTMENT AS A MINISTER OF LAW JUDGE FOR THEBORDER ROLE HERE ARE RECOGNIZED AS ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES DO THAT OUR JOB AS COMMISSIONER IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. HOWEVER IS ALSO SHOWING THE WARNING PUBLIC SAFETY IS ALWAYS THE FOUNDATION FOR DECISIONS ARE I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD BE DONE BY SURE RESPECT TO EVERYONE THAT INCLUDES.

TO THE DEDICATED STAFF AT THE BOARD WHO HAS PROVIDED AN EXCELLENT AMOUNT OF SUPPORT DURING THESE THESE LAST FEW YEARS. I AM HERE TO. IN THE HOPES OF CONTINUING MY PUBLIC SERVICE OFFERING MY EXPERIENCES AND TRAINING BOTH AS AN ATTORNEY AND AS AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE AND- VARIOUS STATE AGENCIES SO THAT I CAN CONTRIBUTE TO A PUBLIC SAFETY RECOGNIZING REHABILITATION AND CHANGE AND PROVIDING A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL FORUM FOR ALL OF THE- PARTICIPANTS- WHO APPEAR.

THANK YOU SO MUCH- I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND TURN TO YOU SENATOR LAYERED AND LET YOU START AND I'M GOING TO ASK IF YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC QUESTION- FOR A SPECIFIC COMMISSIONER. DIRECTED TO THAT COMMISSIONER FEW WANT ALL COMMISSIONERS TO RESPOND THEN LET ME AS THE FACILITATOR GO DOWN THE LINE AND ASK SO OUR COURT REPORTER WILL BE SURE AND GET THE NAME OF THE PERSON WHO'S GOING TO BE RESPONDING. PERFECT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND IN A MOMENT. THE FIRST ONE WILL BE TO ALL OF THEM SO FAR- GIVE YOU A HEADS UP THAT THAT'S COMING. A. N. R. WOULD JUST SAY THAT I HAD A CHANCE TO MEET WITH ALL OF YOU YESTERDAY OR MONDAY. I REALLY APPRECIATED. AND MY FIRST QUESTION IS ROOTED IN WHAT OUR CONVERSATION WAS BECAUSE EACH OF YOU. HAS A VERY. WORK RELATED BUT DIFFERENT PATH ON THE WAY OUT TO THIS BOARD FROM A WARDEN. ATTORNEY AND STATE SERVICES AND DIFFERENT THINGS AND SO. OF ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT OUR CONVERSATION WAS ASKING. WHAT IN YOUR EXPERIENCE DO YOU DRAW ON TO DO THIS JOB WELL WHAT FROM WHAT YOU DID BEFORE THAT THAT YOU BRING TO THIS AND SORT OF COLORS WHAT YOU DO AND THEN. THAT'S WHAT THE PRO TEM DECIDE. WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TAKE. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER DOBBS LET ME START WITH YOU AND THEN I'LL GO TO THE NEXT PERSON GO AHEAD. THANK YOU THANK YOU GOD SENATOR LAYERED. SO WHAT I DRAW FROM FROM ALL OF MY VARIOUS POSITIONS IS- THE FACT THAT PEOPLE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE ABILITY TO LEARN AND GROW AND CHANGE AND I SAW EXAMPLES OF BLACKS WHEN I WORKED AS A DEPENDENCY ATTORNEY REPRESENTING CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND I SAW THE AMOUNT OF TRAUMA THAT THEY EXPERIENCED AND HOW THEY WERE ABLE TO FIND A WAY THROUGH THE ACTS. AND NOT JUST THE CHILDREN BUT ADDITIONAL HEARINGS AS WELL THAT WHEN GIVEN THE RIGHT SUPPORT SERVICES THAT THEY WERE ALSO ABLE TO FIND WAYS- TO REUNITE THEIR FAMILIES AND SO THAT IS KIND OF GUIDED THE IDEA THAT ALL OF THE INCARCERATED PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT HERE BEFORE US HAD MAXIME ABILITY TO- CHANGE THEIR LIVES. AND TO LEARN AND TO GROW. THANK YOU SO MUCH HI MISTER LONG WHY DON'T YOU GO NEXT. SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE STARTING IN THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE I'VE SEEN SOME DRAMATIC CHANGES AND- WAS ALSO PART OF HELPING TO IMPLEMENT THOSE CHANGES PARTICULARLY AT IN COLLEGE PROGRAMS AND REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS. AND I SAW THE EFFECT IT HAD ON OUR GIVING HOPE TO THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE. INCARCERATED AND- YOUR FAST FORWARD TO TODAY IT'S A MUCH DIFFERENT MUCH BETTER DEPARTMENT IN MANY WAYS AND- I BELIEVE THAT HAVING THAT EXPERIENCES. ARE REALLY BENEFICIAL FOR ME- IN THE VALUE WAITING THERE ARE SUITABILITY FOR PAROLE UNDERSTANDING THE CULTURE IN PRISON UNDERSTANDING THE AVAILABLE OPPORTUNITIES- IT'S REALLY GIVEN ME A GOOD BASE I THINK TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS. WITH FOLKS THAT APPEAR BEFORE US. THANK YOU SO MUCH COMMISSIONER LONG COMMISSIONER MINOR GO RIGHT AHEAD. THANK YOU. I AM I HAD THE PRIVILEGE WHEN I FIRST STARTED AS A YOUTH CORRECTIONAL COUNSELOR OF WORKING AS THE OFFICER IN THE BOARD ROOM SO MY PERSON OBJECTION TO COMMISSIONERS WHAT WAS THAT WORK IN THE BOARD ROOM AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE EIGHTY SIX I THOUGHT THAT THE WORK THAT THEY DID WAS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE BACK BENCH- JUVENILE JUSTICE- CORRECT AND COMMISSIONERS ACTUALLY SET BOARD ORDERS AND BASICALLY WORKED THROUGH THE REHABILITATIVE PROCESS WITH ME INCARCERATED YOUTH AND SO. WE HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE FROM THAT VANTAGE POINT AND AS I CONTINUED THROUGH MY CAREER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE I SAW THEM IMPLEMENT NUMEROUS PROGRAMS RELATED PROGRAMS- DIFFERENT TYPE OF COMMUNICATION- PROGRAMS THAT WOULD. INTERVIEWING I SAW A LOT OF HAPPEN IN IN DJ OR THE COURSE OF TIME AND I MOVED TO ADULT CORRECTIONS SO I BOTH A NOT ONLY HAVE THE EXPERIENCE WITH AND JUVENILE I ALSO HAD. EXPERIENCE WITH THE ADULTS AND SO I WAS ABLE TO SEE THE PROCESS- KIND OF MORPHING GROWING CHANGE IN IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WHEN SEC RPR AND- CDCR I WAS REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES AND SO TO BE A PART OF. THIS PROCESS I BELIEVE STILL IT IS PART OF THE REHABILITATIVE PROCESS. I THINK MY EXPERIENCE IN BOTH ORGANIZATIONS. HAS HELPED ME TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT. AIR OPEN. COMMUNICATION WITH. THE PEOPLE WHO COME BEFORE ME. AND IT CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT I CAN- IT WILL MAKE THESE DECISIONS THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT AT TIMES IN A IN A FAIR. WAY. THANK YOU OUR COMMISSIONERS THREE. THANK YOU SENATOR AND THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AS WELL I DO ALSO BELIEVE IN THE R. C. C. R. AS FAR AS WE ABILITY SHIN WHEN THIS QUESTION WAS POLLS ON MONDAY BUT SOONER OR LATER. DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS AT ANY OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION SOME CREDIT WAS PART OF THE CAN. WHEN I LOOK AT MY- TO HEARING AND HOW HIGH SEEMS THAT YOU RETRAIN I LOOK AT IT TWO TIER SYSTEM. FIRST THE PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE I HAVE. REPRESENTING INDIVIDUALS WERE INCARCERATED IN ACCOMPLISHMENTS ATTORNEY BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY MARC PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BECAUSE WHAT I FIND IS THAT. A LOT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO COME BEFORE US THEY COME FROM THE- EITHER TO SAINTE MARIE I'M FROM OR SIMILAR COMMUNITY. AND SO THERE IS A CONNECT WITH THEM AND ALSO IT WOULD BE AS WELL. IN SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED NOT ONLY WORDS OF HOPE. BUT A CONCRETE ROADMAP FOR CHANGE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY NOT ONLY DO I ENJOY THIS JOB. I'M SEEKING REPORT. THANKS COMMISSIONER THANK YOU- GO TO COMMITTEE FIVE AND GO HEAD. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AS THERE ARE THREE ASPECTS OF. OF MY EXPERIENCES THAT RESONATE WITH ME IN RESPONSE TO THE SENATORS QUESTION ONE IS. OVER THE YEARS AND WORKING WITH PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. THE BILL BOTH IN IN THE MILITARY WHEN I SERVED IN THE U. S. NAVY IN THE U. S. COAST GUARD FOR MANY YEARS THAT HE LEARNED TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT- VERYDIVERSE GROUPS. OF ALL LEVELS OF EDUCATION PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY BUT WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT LIFE EXPERIENCES AND THAT HAS TAUGHT ME THE VALUE OF RECOGNIZING THAT. AND WHEN I DID TO PAROLE HEARINGS ARE IT REMINDS ME THAT TWO OF THAT NOT EVERYBODY. GROWS UP THE SAME WAY OR IS EXPOSED TO THE SAME THINGS AS A IN MINISTRY LAW JUDGE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT PEOPLE ARE HEARD BECAUSE- THEY WANT TO BE HEARD THEY WANT TO BE HEARD AND LISTEN TO. AND I HAVE FOUND THAT- MY EXPERIENCE DOING THAT OVER THE YEARS HAS BENEFITED ME. TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF. OF PEOPLE WANTING TO BE HEARD AND BEING TREATED RESPECTFULLY EVEN IF THEY DISAGREE. WITH THE ULTIMATE DECISION. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR THANK YOU AND THEN ONE OTHER QUESTION AND I REVIEWED THE MATERIALS LAST NIGHT AND I'M SORRY ADDED MASS THIS DURING THE MEETINGS BUT- I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO HEAR- WE HAVE A CHARGER I DID IN SOME OF THE MATERIALS PROVIDED TO ME. OF THE PERIOD OF DENIAL BEFORE AN INMATE BECOMES ELIGIBLE FOR THE NEXT PAROLE HEARING DATE. AND AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF THEM WERE FOR THREE YEARS OR FIVE YEARS THAT SEEMS TO BE PRO FORMA LONG AND MINOR. THERE WERE A CHUNK OF PEOPLE THAT WERE TEN YEARS OR FIFTEEN YEARS THAT I WAS GONNA ASK WHAT ARM. WHAT WAS THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS BEFORE ALLOWING SUCH A LONG PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE SOMEONE IS ELIGIBLE FOR THEIR NEXT PATROL BOAT PAROLE HEARING AND THAT WOULD BE DOBBS LONG AND MINOR THOSE WOULD BE THE THREE OKAY THANK YOU. LET ME START BY IN A DIFFERENT ORDER AND GO WITH COMMISSIONER MINOR FIRST AND THEN I'LL GO TO LONG AND DOGS BUT I'LL CALL ON YOU AGAIN SEPARATELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COURT REPORTER SO- COMMISSIONER MINOR GO RIGHT AHEAD. LONG LONG DENIALS ARE BASED ON. NUMEROUS FACTORS AND REALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS A FENDER CHANGE. AND SO IF THERE IS AN INMATE WHO HAS SHOWN. AT PRETTY MUCH ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE WHICH WE RARELY SEE. DID WE SET THAT HAVE DENIAL LINKS BASED ON CLEAR AND CONVINCING CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT HE THAT LINK BUT TIME IS APPROPRIATE SO. IF WE ARE. LIKE YOU LIKE YOU SAID YOU CAN LOOK AT THE NUMBERS THERE THERE AND THERE ARE MANY BUT THERE ARE SOME AND THERE ARE SIGNS THAT HAVE NOT CHANGED DON'T WANT TO CHANGE WILL COME INTO THE HEARING ROOM AND TELL US. THAT THEY'RE NT CHANGING AND THAT THEY'RE STILL INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IN THE INSTITUTION AND THAT THEY HAVE NOT TAKEN ANY STEPS TOWARDS REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMMING AND SO IF WE DON'T FIND BY CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT EIGHT LENGTH OF TIME- READY SOONER IS APPROPRIATE THEN WE ASSIGN. THE APPROPRIATE TIME BASED ON ALL. OF THE FACTORS THAT WOULD REVIEW. THANK YOU ARE. SORRY IS THAT IS NOW RIVER HAD THAT PERFECT I COMMISSIONER LONG. SO I SIGNALED ROW NINETY- IS. SOMETHING THAT WE DEFINITELY- A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO AND REALLY THE MAIN FACTOR IS ARE THEY STILL DANGEROUS CERTAINLY STILL VIOLENT TYPICALLY- I DON'T BELIEVE I'VE EVER SAID A FIFTEEN YEAR TO UPGRADE BUT I HAVE HAD A FEW TENURE TO NILES. IN THOSE CASES- VOTERS TYPICALLY EXTREME VIOLENCE AND EXTREME RECENT VIOLENCE AND ARE ALSO- ALMOST UNIVERSALLY WITH THOSE FOLKS THAT ARE STILL ENGAGING IN A LOT OF VIOLENCE IS THIS KIND OF RESISTANCE TO CHANGE AND PROGRAMMING. AND SO- DOES THE FACTORS I THINK IT'S BATES DAYS SIMPLY DON'T AREN'T READY YET TO CHANGE AND THEY NEED A LOT OF PROGRAMMING IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THEIR IMPULSES INTO. THIS- HE SAYS FROM THE VIOLENT ATTITUDES AND- BEHAVIORS. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER ODD AND COMMISSIONER DOBBS. YES SO I'D I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING ALL OF MY- MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SAID- AND THE ONLY THING I COULD ADD IS THAT. FIFTEEN AND TEN YOUR DENIALS ARE EXTREMELY RARE AND IT'S USUALLY A CASE THAT THE PERSON APPEARING BEFORE US IS STILL INVOLVED IN A HIGH LEVEL OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. SO THAT MAYBE TRACKING DRUG INTO THE PRISON WARDEN ASSAULTS ON OTHER INMATES- AND OF COURSE ALL OF THAT PROVIDES A DIRECT LINK TO THE THEM BEING CURRENTLY DANGEROUS. AND ADDITIONALLY THE OTHER ELEMENT IS THAT THEY OFTEN HAVE NOT BEEN INVOLVED IN PROGRAMS- AND SO WE CHOSE THE DENIAL LAND. IF IT'S HIGH DINNER AND IT'S USUALLY THE ACCENTS OF PROGRAMMING AND THE CONTINUATION OF HIGH LEVEL CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THE RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION AND TO THE OTHER ONE. OUT OF THEM YOU KNOW BARRING SOMETHING DRAMATIC THAT TURNS UP IN THE HEARING I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING ALL FIVE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED. LET ME TURN TO SENATOR GROWTH AND- LET YOU GO AHEAD GET STARTED AND LET ME KNOW HOW YOU WANT TO ASK THE QUESTIONS THANK YOU MADAM PRO TEM THANK ALL OF YOU I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR- COMING THE POOREST TODAY. AND I KNOW HOW I- APPRECIATE WHAT COMMISSIONER DOBBS SAID THAT THIS IS THE HARDEST JOB SHE'S EVER DONE BUT THE MOST REWARDING AND I BELIEVE THAT COMMISSIONER SHE SAID THE SAME THING SO- I APPRECIATE YOUR ALL WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE ON THIS AND- COMMISSION. FOR THIS BOARD. I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR ALL OF YOUIT'S KIND OF LINKS LEASE SO I DO APOLOGIZE AND THEN I JUST HAVE TWO QUESTIONS FOR MISSED OPS. BUT THE QUESTION I HAVE FOR ALL OF YOU AND ALL OF THE SENATE PRO TEM DECIDE WHO GOES FIRST. IS WHAT'S THE MAIN REASON OR MAIN REASONS THAT YOU LOOK AT THE NINETEEN FOR. DENYING PAROLE OR GIVING A GRANT. AND HOW MUCH SUBJECTIVITY DO YOU HAVE IN DETERMINING THEIR SUSTAINABILITY OR AND SUSTAINABILITY ONCE THEY GET OUT ORDER AND ASK COMMISSIONER HI TYRA TO GO FIRST. THANK YOU THE PAROLE WE USE A STRUCTURED DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK TO LOOK AT THESE EMPIRICAL AREAS. THAT WE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT IN OUR TRAINING THAT REFLECT OF THE OF MITIGATING RAGER AGGRAVATING FACTORS IN HOW WE REVIEW OF THE- INMATES THERE THE- PERSONS OF PEARL SAID ABILITY- SO THAT COULD BE. THURMOND. CONDUCT RELATED IT COULD BE HISTORIC RELATED STATIC FACTORS WE KNOW THAT STATIC FACTORS OVER TIME MAY NO LONGER INDICATE THAT DANGEROUS SO WE LOOK AT THE MORE DYNAMIC FACTORS WHICH WOULD BE CONDUCT AKON DOCUMENTED CONDUCT IN PRISON ABOUT HOW THEY INTERACT WITH OTHERS WHAT THEY'VE LEARNED IN THEIR GROUPS AND PROGRAMS AND ADDRESSING WHAT THEY'VE IDENTIFIED AS THE- CHARACTERS. THAT LED THEM TO MAKE THOSE. DECISIONS THAT RESULTED IN THE A COMMITMENT OFFENSES OR THEIR CRIMINALITY IN GENERAL. BUT SO- WE LOOK AT THOSE THINGS. OF YOUR RECENT MISCONDUCT IS WAITED GIVEN MORE WEIGHT THAN. MISCONDUCT IN PRISON FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS YOU KNOW. THAT HIS RECORD YOU KNOW MANY MANY YEARS AGO AND SO ALL OF THAT IS. IT CONTINUING EVALUATION AND EVERY EVERY CASE IS DIFFERENT WHICH IS THE CHALLENGING PART FOR ME EVERY CASE IS DIFFERENT EVERY ALL OF THESE FACTORS THAT WE HAVE EVOLVED AND- BASED ON HOW HOW WE REVIEW THE RECORD AND THE RESPONSES AND WHICH INCLUDES THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF THE RISK ASSESSMENT REPORT- AND- WHETHER OR NOT THE CITY. THE SUSTAINABILITY. WE ALSO REVIEW THINGS LIKE PEARL PLANS AND WHETHER THE PERSON HAS PLANNED FOR RELEASE WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED AS NEEDING TO FOR. TO DEVELOP. A PROGRAM ON RELEASE THE DIVISION OF ADULT PAROLE OPERATIONS WILL ALSO DO THAT FOR INMATES WHO WHO HAVE TROUBLE YOU KNOW THEY MAY NOT HAVE FAMILY SUPPORT THE- AND- BECAUSE OF THEIR AGE AND THEIR THEIR CONNECTIONS THEY MAY NOT HAVE SUPPORT OUT COMMUNITIES SO- THOSE ARE THINGS THAT- THE DIVISION OF ADULT PAROLE OPERATIONS WILL HELP THEM WITH- IT TRANSITIONAL HOUSING. BUT WE CAN ALSO ORDER THEM INTO THAT IN TERMS OF HELPING THEM MAKE THAT TRANSITION SO THOSE ARE THE TOOLS THAT WE USE. THANK YOU THANK YOU- COMMISSIONER REEF. THANK OU IN ADDITION TO COMMISSIONER CHARLES RESPONSE WHEN FOCUSING ON THE TOOL THAT WE USE THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK THERE'S DIFFERENT DOMAINS WE INVESTIGATE AND ANALYSE THE MOST IMPORTANT DOMAIN IS THE MORE DYNAMIC DOMAIN AND THAT'S A MAJOR CHANGE AND WHAT WE'RE SEEKING THERE IS TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS INCARCERATED WHETHER OR NOT THEY THINK PEOPLE TO FIRST IDENTIFY THOSE UNDERLYING RISK FACTORS THAT CAUSED HIM. TO COME INTO PRISON SYSTEM NUMBER TWO WE'RE NOT NEEDING ASIAN PROGRAMMING CHIU UNDERSTAND OR DRESSED AS AN ARTIST FACTORS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT ARE THE INTERNALIZE WHAT THE LEARNED IN SUCH PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE THAT HE WILL NOT RETRAIN AND CREATE ADDITIONAL VICTIMS THE SECOND PART A QUESTION ASKED MR TARVER SPOKE ONE IS THE- ROLE PROCESS AS FAR AS YOUR POOL PLANS WE'RE NOT BE HAPPY. TO PLAN TO ADDRESS THOSE UNDERLYING RISK FACTORS SUCH AS GANG INVOLVEMENT CLASS OPENS OF USE INVESTING VIOLENCE IN SUCH WE ALSO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S ANY MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS IN PLACE ARE THERE WRITTEN FOR ABLE TO ARTICULATE DURING MENTAL HEALTH PLAN AND WHAT WE MEAN. BY THAT IS. IN IS GREAT PAROLE THEIR NEXT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE OWNERS WHY TO ONE SIGN UP TO TALK. OF THINGS OF OR- AND WE NEED TO READ ONE SIGNS WARNING TERM CHU WHAT RESOURCE GONNA TURN TO THE NEXT THEY ABLE TO. ADDRESS THOSE AS- WE ALSO FOCUS ON IT BEING PRO AT OF THE CITY'S ARTS FAR AS WHAT. IMAGES TO MAKE SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE REALLY TO. AND NOT RELEASED BACK INTO ME RECENTLY WITH GET MY SOURCE ALIBAG BY ACTUAL KIND SCHEME. THAT CAN BE PUT TO USE IN THE POINT SYSTEM AND ONE SURE THAT. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH INMATES OR ITS INDIVIDUAL. WHO HAVE BEEN. INVOLVE IN DIFFERENT CRIMES. IN SO. HAVING MORE SCHEME HAVE MEAN A STRONG ETHIC WHILE IN PRISON IT'S A GOOD INDICATOR THAT THEY WANT TO USE THOSE SKILLS IN THE COMMUNITY AS WELL. AND LASTLY WE ALSO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE. SPECIAL CONDITIONS OF PAROLE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE GRATEFUL. NOT ONLY FOR PUBLIC SAFETY BUT ALSO FOR THE SUCCESS OF ANY INDIVIDUAL. FOR EXAMPLE IF THERE'S NO HEALTH CONCERNS WE CAN REFER THEM TO WHAT USED TO BE CALLED CONTROL THE OUTPATIENT CLINIC WHICH IS NOW THE BEHAVIORAL. ARE REINTEGRATION PROGRAM WE SEEM FOR THEM THEY'RE- ALSO REFERRED HIM TO A- DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAM OR SUBSIDIES PROGRAM WIDELY REDUCE MANUFACTURERS AT A STATE ON. A TRACKING DO NOT RE OFFEND AS WELL. THANK THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU COMMISSIONER COMMISSIONER MIND. OKAY IN ADDITION TO THE START TO SEE MAKING THAT WE HAVE THAT WE UTILIZE WE ARE THERE'S ALSO CASE THERE KIND OF THERE'S A CODE THERE ARE DIFFERENT HERE IT FOR WE LOOK AT TO AND THAT'S GOING TO BE AND MY FOR COLLEAGUES RESEARCH. SO WHEN IN LOOKING THE NILE GRANTING A POOR WE CONSIDER MANY FACTORS AND THOSE ARE SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL FACTORS AND THE DESTRUCTION DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK AS HELP SAYS REALLY PUT ALL OF THOSE PIECES TOGETHER AND- REALLY AT THE VALUE WAIT THE RISK FACTORS AND LOOK AT CURRENT DANGER IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT AND THEN MAKE AB INCARCERATED PERSONS ABILITY TO. BE PROSOCIAL IN THE COMMUNITY OR NOT- AND I THINK. I THINK THEY COVERED YOU KNOW WHAT. HELLO CONDITIONS AS WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY THAT WE- THE ABILITY TO SET. QUITE A FEW DIFFERENT PEOPLE CAN. TUNING SHORE SUCCESS. FOR- PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY. THANK YOU ARE COMMISSIONER LONG. THANK YOU- I'M SORRY I MIGHT NEED IT NO YOU'RE GOOD WE HEAR YOU OKAY GREAT I GOT A NOTICE THAT I WAS ON MUTE. BOB DYLAN SO I AGREE. COMPLETELY WITH THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES. ARE THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING FOR MADISON L. SEVEN SPACE. FRAMEWORK THAT THERE ARE REALLY CAN INFORM OUR DECISION MAKING- AND CERTAINLY. UNDER THE LAW WE SHOULD NORMALLY GRATEFUL OF MY SERVICES AT OUR CURRENT NEXUS EVIDENCE OF THE CURRENT ASSISTANT. DANGEROUS TO US AND- YOU KNOW THE EVIDENCE TYPICALLY DOES COME IN THE FORM OF BOB NO MISCONDUCT AND FOR- CRIMINAL THINKING IT WILL COME OUT OFTENTIMES IN A HEARING- AND SO. OUR THE FRAMEWORK REALLY IS THE ESSENTIAL FACTORS- I DON'T HAVE A LOT TO ADD TO WHAT MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY LAID OUT PRETTY THOROUGHLY BUT- THE FRAMEWORK REALLY HELPS US. IN IN THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER OF COMMISSIONER DOBBS. THANK YOU I AGREE WITH ALLOF THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUES THE ONLY THING I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO ASK IS YOU KNOW PART OF- GOING THROUGH THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING FRAMEWORK HAS US LOOKING APPS. OF THE PERSON BEFORE US PRIOR HISTORY AND SO OFTEN TIMES WE SEE THE PERSON BEFORE US HAVE HAD A LONG HISTORY OF PRIOR FAILURES ON ROLE. AND JUST SO WHEN THAT IS THE CASE. IT IS SO IMPORTANT FOR US TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT'S GOING TO BE DIFFERENT THIS TIME HOW. ARE THEY NOW FOR SUCCESS AND AGAIN THAT WILL INVOLVE. VERY SOME VERY DETAILED WORLD FINDS THAT REALLY COVERS ALL THE BASES. IN AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS WITH THEM IN THE PAST AND REALLY SET UP IN SUCH A WAY TO HELP THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL THIS TIME AROUND. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER THANK YOU. I DO HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION FOR COMMISSIONER AND MINOR. AS I LIKED WHAT YOU SAID AND COMMISSIONER JOB SAID THE SAME THING BASICALLY. M. THE COMMISSION MINOR CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME EXAMPLES OF THE SET CONDITIONS OF PAROLE LIKE IS IT YOUR SET CONDITIONS OF PAROLE. WE CAN SET CONDITIONS- FOR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING FOR SIX MONTHS WHICH GIVES THEM THAT'S ONE LESS THING THEY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE ACTUALLY HAVE HOUSING THAT THEY ARE IN THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT. YOU KNOW TRYING TO FIND SOMEWHERE TO GO WE CAN SET CONDITIONS THAT THEY HAD- PROBLEMS WITH SUBSTANCES WE CAN SECOND EDITION IS THAT THEY ARE. READ IT- THAT THEY HAVE- ARE PARTICIPATE IN A SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT PROGRAM OR- WE CAN SET CONDITIONS THAT THEY- ARE IF THERE ARE SEX OFFENDERS THAT THEY PARTICIPATE IN SEX OFFENDER TREATMENT PROGRAMMING IF THEY'RE- YOU KNOW BEEN. CONVICTED OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THAT THEY PARTICIPATE IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAMS SO WE CAN SET A LIST AND IT IT IS ALL CONNECTED TO THE CRIME FOR WHICH THEY ARE PRESENT SO IF THEY YOU KNOW HAD ISSUES. IN THE PAST I'M HOMELESSNESS- YOU KNOW. WE CAN EXPECT THOSE CONDITIONS SO THAT THEY ARE MORE SUCCESSFUL AT THE PAST PROBLEMS WITH GANGS WE CAN SET GAME CONDITIONS THAT THEY ARE NOT TO- PARTICIPATING GANG ACTIVITY- WHERE THAT. THAT THAT THE CLOTHING OF GANG MEMBERS WHICH TOO MANY OF THEM ARE FROM WAY PAST THAT BUT WE CAN STEP THOSE CONDITIONS SO WE SET THE CONDITIONS BASED ON REALLY- THEY'RE WANTING. THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE CAN SET CONDITIONS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CONTACT WITH THE VICTIMS OF THE VICTIMS NEXT OF KIN THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SOMETIMES WE CAN ALSO SET CONDITIONS THAT MAY NOT LIVE IN A CERTAIN. AREA IS SO THAT THE VICTIMS ARE NOT- WORRIED THAT THEY'RE IN IN THAT THE SAME COUNTY THAT THERE AND- WE HAVE A- PRETTY GOOD- WE HAVE A PRETTY PROBLEMS OR QUESTIONS HAVE A GREAT LEGAL TEAM THAT WE- CAN. CALL AND ASK FOR STATE CAN DO THIS CAN WE DO THAT WHAT YOU KNOW AND REALLY ASSISTANCE WITH THE LANGUAGE TO MAKE SURE THAT- INCARCERATED PERSONS SUCCESSFUL IN EVERY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH COMMISSIONER THANK YOU AM.

INSURANCE I THINK TO TAKE OFF THE FROM THE QUESTION- CENTER GROVE ASK THE BOARD ENSURING THE VICTIMS AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ARE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE. AND CERTAINLY IN MAKES BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR ATTORNEYS TO RECEIVE A FAIR HEARING JUST JUST CLOSELY HOW IS IT WORKING IN THIS PANDEMIC AND YOU'RE CONDUCTING THE HEARINGS. AND I YOU KNOW I DON'T NEED TO GO DOWN THE LINE AND ASK EVERYONE BUT FOR THE COURT REPORTER SAKE I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE IF YOU JUST WANT TO KIND OF RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT GIVE ME YOUR FEEDBACK I DON'T NEED EVERYBODY TO ANSWER. I SEE THAT COMMISSIONER LONG HAS HAS RAISED HIS HAND AND THEN I'LL GO TO YOU COMMISSIONER TERRA BUT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH COMMISSIONER LOG THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR. I DO WANT TO SAY THAT IT WAS A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING INITIALLY- AND- WE HAVE AMAZING SUPPORT FROM THE BOARD OF REALLY HELPED US NAVIGATE THROUGH THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF A VIDEO CONFERENCE HEARINGS ARE. I BELIEVE THE THEY'RE VERY EFFECTIVE SILENCE CONCERNED INITIALLY THAT'S NOT HAVING TO FACE TO FACE CONTACT PERSON. WHO'S GOING TO. CHANGE THE DYNAMIC OF THE HEARING AND I FOUND IN MY EXPERIENCE IT REALLY ASKED. AND THE OTHER THING THAT'S REALLY GREAT IS THAT IT DOES ALLOW YOU TO FIX IT FOR INCREASED PARTICIPATION BY VICTIMS AND VICTIMS FAMILY MEMBERS. AND BUT HAD. BECOMES FAMILY MEMBERS PARTICIPATE FROM AS FAR AWAY AS IT IS EUROPE AND- LATIN AMERICA THAT PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE HEARING OF THE WINDS. AND SO THERE'S AN ADVANTAGE THERE AS WELL. AND I REALLY YOU KNOW WHEN YOU AT THE L. ARE REALLY NO- STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. IN THE OUTCOMES SO I THINK OVERALL IT'S A BENEFIT WE ALSO. ARE NOT. DRIVING THE CARS UP AND DOWN THESTATE BURNING GAS AND- IT MEETING CARBON EMISSIONS AND SO THERE SO THERE'S A LOT OF POSITIVES THAT I SEE. ARE YOU JUST MADE- SENATOR LAYER TO SMILE WHEN YOU REFERENCE THE FORMER SECRETARY NATURAL RESOURCES- SO THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND- CERTAINLY I THINK WE HAVE FOUND DOING REMOTE PARTICIPATION HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT MORE CUMBERSOME AT TIMES BUT I THINK WE HAVE NOTICED THAT PEOPLE WHO WOULDN'T ORDINARILY BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE HAVE DONE SO. THAT IS GOOD TO HEAR- COMMISSIONER TYRA YOU WANTED TO COMMENT. I DID I IF I GREW WITH COMMISSIONER ALONG- IT'S BEEN OVERALL A BENEFIT FOR ALL AND IT DID START WITH SOME TREPIDATION AND A FEW HICCUPS- BUT OVERALL I THINK THE BENEFITS OUTWEIGH THE DRAWBACKS. OF BECAUSE WE DO SEE INCREASE PARTICIPATION- WITH THE VICTIMS AND THE VICTIMS FAMILY MEMBERS- WHEREAS BEFORE THEY WOULD HAVE TO COME TO THE PRESENT IN PERSON. WHICH IS A VERY CUMBERSOME PROCESS. OR IF THEY WANTED TO PARTICIPATE BY THE VIDEO THEY WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE DISCOURAGE OFFICE BECAUSE OF THE COMPATIBILITY WITH THE EQUIPMENT- AND NOW. WE'VE TRANSITION AND THEY CAN PARTICIPATE FROM FROM HOME AND- I FIND THAT THAT IS A MUCH MORE. REASONABLE AND MORE COMFORTABLE SITTING IN A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AFTER SEATING. FOR FAMILY MEMBERS. I WONDER IF YOU ANTICIPATE TO- CONTINUE UNTIL ALLOW THAT AS A POSSIBILITY JUST BECAUSE ONCE PEOPLE YOUR FIRST ONCE YOU'RE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY A DIFFERENT WAY TO BECOMES MORE CONVENIENT FOR YOU YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE THAT UP BUT- THAT'S A QUESTION FOR I GUESS ANOTHER DAY. I DIDN'T WANT TO CUT ANYBODY OFF IF ANYONE ELSE WANTS TO COMMENT WHY. DON'T I KEEP YOU BUT I ALSO NOTICED THAT- SENATOR COM LONGER IS HEARING AND MY FEAR IS ALWAYS THAT SHE WILL BE SNATCHED AWAY AGAIN TO. FINISH HER JOB IS BUDGET SUB SO COMMISSIONER ARMY COMMISSIONER US SENATOR- IF YOU ARE PREPARED AND READY WHY DON'T I TURN THE MICROPHONE OVER TO YOU TO ASK COMMENTS AND WHAT I AM DOING TO HELP- THE COURT REPORTER. IS IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR EVERYONE THAT I WILL FACILITATE EACH NAME SO THAT THE COURT REPORTER CAN GET THE NAME DAY OUT SO IF YOU JUST WANT TO DIRECT IT TO A COMMISSIONER YOU CAN IF YOU WANT EVERYONE TO ANSWER A QUESTION THAT I WILL FACILITATE THAT EACH ONE ANSWERING GOING. PERFECT THANK YOU MADAM FOR ATTEMPTS SO I HAD THEM. A QUESTION FOR. MISS MINOR- AND THIS IS- SPECIFIC TO- IN CARS RATED WOMEN- ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT- HAD- MAYBE SEXUAL ABUSE OR- TRAUMA IN THEIR PAST THAT MIGHT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT LED THEM TO BECOME INCARCERATED. JUST WANTING TO KNOW HOW DO YOU DETERMINE- HOW THEIR PAST TRAUMA PLAYS INTO THEIR CRIME WHEN THEY'RE COMING BEFORE YOU. THAT'S THE COMMISSIONER MINOR GO AHEAD. SO PRIOR TO TOWN AT THE INCARCERATED PERSON EVEN COMING INTO THE HEARING I WILL HAVE REVIEWED ALL OF THE INFORMATION THAT I FOUND THAT THAT IS IN THE RECORD REGARDING THEIR PAST TRAUMA- BUT WE WOULD HAVE. SOME CONVERSATION CERTAINLY WE DON'T WANT TO TRIGGER ANY- ANYTHING WITHIN A ACT WITH THE PERSON WHO'S HAD THAT HAPPEN FROM A BUT WE DO TALK ABOUT THE TRAUMA THERE'S ALSO A RISK ASSESSMENT THAT GIVES REALLY GOOD IDEA ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. IN THE- INCARCERATED PERSONS LIFE AND SO WE TALK ABOUT- I ASK AND TELL ME WHAT THE FACTORS WERE THAT BECAUSE YOU DO X. Y. Z. AND MANY TIMES IT DOES CONNECT BACK TO TRAUMA AND THEN WE WORK- WE TALK ABOUT REHABILITATIVE EFFORTS THAT. A PERSON HAS TAKEN TO- HAVE MANAGED AND WORK THROUGH THE TRAUMA SO I DO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION A PERSON'S- TRAUMA AND ALL THAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH AND IN THE LIGHT IT'S SPECIFICALLY- EVEN WHEN WE HAVE A VERY YOUNG PEOPLE. THAT ALSO HAS A BEARING ON WHAT I LOOK AT IN TERMS OF DETERMINING HOW THAT TRAUMA HAS PLAYED INTO THE CRIME THAT. THEY COMMITTED. THANK YOU FOR I WAS WONDERING I'M SURE IF I COULD ALSO ASK THE SAME. TO MR SHARIF- YES GO AHEAD- COMMISSIONERS TO REVIEW HER ID MAKE SURE YOU HEARD THE QUESTION THAT QUESTION I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUES INITIAL MINOR. IN ADDITION TO RECOGNIZING UNDERLYING TRAUMA ONE COURTNEY WHAT WE ALSO WANT TO SEE IS WHETHER OR NOT. THE INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN PEOPLE TO CREATE COPING MECHANISMS TO DEAL WITH THE TRAUMA. OFTENTIMES YOU BECOME A CANNOT BE WAS ALL RIGHT. SO SIGNIFICANT CONTINUATION THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES. WHAT YOU WANT WHEN YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL HAS BEEN ABLE TO CREATE THESE COPING MECHANISMS TOOLS THEY CAN UTILIZE. SO THAT THE ONE CREATING THE VICTIMS THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF ALL HER WOULD BE THE SAME THAT HURT PEOPLE HURT PEOPLE. CONSOLE THE MAIN CONCERN IS PUBLIC SAFETY. BUT ALSO WOULD BE CARP. CONCRETE A RISK ASSESSMENT S. COMMISSION MINOR INITIATED IS A DEEP. SO SPEECH INTO THAT AREA AND SO WHAT WE DO NOT WANT TO DO IS OPEN THOSE WARMS UP. HERE BUT WE DO WANT RECOGNIZE THAT TRAUMA AND WHETHER OR NOT THE INDIVIDUAL. THOSE COPING SKILLS REPORT THANK YOU. RIGHT THANK YOU AND MY QUESTION IS MY LAW I WONDERING I WAS TOLD THAT THE RESIDENT. RATE ARE LOWER FOR THOSE THAT COME OF YOU- FOR YOUR PAROLE HEARINGS RATHER THAN THOSE WHO ARE JUST RELEASED. CAN YOU SORT OF SHARE ON THAT. MISTER LONG GO AHEAD. CERTAINLY THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SENATOR- I BELIEVE THE- THE RECIDIVISM RATES. BASED ON THE DATA FROM CDC ARE ARRANGED FROM ABOUT THREE TO FIVE PERCENT- THAT'S A THREE YEAR RECIDIVISM RATES FOR NEW MISDEMEANORS OR FELONIES VIOLENT FELONIES IS LESS THAN 1% AND SO- YOU. IS THAT IS THAT YOUR QUESTION DOES IT DOES THOSE ARE ALL SINGLE DIGIT NUMBER I LOVE THEM- AND THEN MY FINAL QUESTION I GUESS WILL BE FOR- MISS DOBBS AND MISTER TYRONE THAT WAY EVERYONE WILL HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO SAY SOMETHING- I CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT YOU ALL ARE IN TOUGH POSITIONS BECAUSE YOU'RE- THE GOAL IS TO HAVE PAROLE HEARINGS TO SEE PEOPLE'S TO GAUGE THEIR- SUCCESS IN REHABILITATION SO THAT THEY CAN BE RELEASED- NONE OF YOU I DON'T BELIEVE HAVE CRYSTAL BALLS OR AREN'T MAGICIANS- OR CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE BECAUSE IF YOU COULD YOU PROBABLY WOULD NOT BE IN THESE JOBS- AND- YET. I CAN IMAGINE THAT THE LAST THING ANYONE WANTS. IS TO. PICK UP THE PAPER AND SEE A NEWS ARTICLE ABOUT SOMEONE. INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT CAME BEFORE YOU- WHICH COULD CREATE A LOT OF TREPIDATION. WHEN IT COMES TO APPROVING OF FOLKS- AND GRANTING THEM A REQUEST FOR PAROLE SO HOW DO YOU SORT OF RECONCILE ALL OF THAT BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY AT THE END OF THE DAY THE GOAL IS YOU KNOW TO TALK TO FOLKS AND TO ASSESS THEIR SUCCESS IN THEIR REHABILITATION. IT IS NOT TO SUBJECTIVELY GAUGE THEIR DEGREE OF REMORSE AND IF IT JOBS WITH YOU AND IT IS ULTIMATELY TO RELEASE THEM SO THAT THEY CAN ENTER BACK INTO COMMUNITIES HOPEFULLY WITH THE PLAN THAT HAS BEEN PUT TOGETHER WITH OTHER FOLKS THAT WILL ALLOW THEM TO BE SUCCESSFUL. SO THE QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU SORT OF RECONCILE THE STRESS OF THE ANXIETY OF WHAT THE PUBLIC. UNDERSTANDS WITH REGARDS TO YOUR PROCESS AND HOW PEOPLE SEE FOLKS WITH CRIMINAL- PATH AND THE GOAL TO HELP FOLKS GET PAROLED SO THAT THEY CAN GET BACK INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES LET'S START A COMMISSIONER I THINK JOBS- CAN GO FIRST AND THEN AND THEN I'LL GO TO COMMISSIONER ODD TYRA SO COMMISSIONER JOBS GO AHEAD. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER. WE'RE WE'RE ALL GETTING OUR TITLES WRONG I STARTED THAT THAT MESS GO AHEAD MMHM. IT'S IS- IT'S SOMETHING ALWAYS A YOU KNOW FOREFRONT OF OUR MINDS ARE WE MAKING THE RIGHT DECISION YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT THIS PERSON WILL BE THE ONE WHO WILL RE OFFEND AND COLLEAGUES. INCREDIBLE HARM TO SOMEONE ELSE. AND I THINK BAO THAT. WITH THE AMOUNT OF TRAINING THAT WE HAVE REALLY AFFECTING THAT PERSON'S RISK FACTOR THEIR PREPAREDNESS FOR SUCCESS. AND I LET THAT DRIVE MY DECISION ARE THEY TRULY READY HAVE THEY DONE THE WORK- WHAT DOES THEIR BEHAVIOR CHAU HAVE THEY BEEN SHOWING REHABILITATION FOR SOME TIME. AND I LET THAT GUIDE MY DECISION. YOU KNOW THERE IS NO REASON TO BASE MY DECISION ON THE VERY SMALL PROBABILITY THAT THIS PERSON MIGHT RECEIVE THE BATES WHEN THE BULK OF THE EVIDENCE SHOWS OTHERWISE. THANK YOU COMMISSIONER ODD COMMISSIONER TYRA. THANK YOU SENATOR I CONCURWAS- USER DOBBS IT IS OUR TRAINING- IT IS THE FRAMEWORK THAT- WE USE- THE STRUCTURE DECISION MAKING MODEL WITH THE RISK FACTORS AND THE DYNAMICS THAT GO INTO HOW WE CONDUCT THE HEARINGS WHAT WE SEE IN THE RECORD THE- THE COMPREHENSIVE RISK ASSESSMENT AND- THE- HER GOAL. OF MAKING TERKEL'S THAT WE- HAVE IMPLEMENTED TO GAUGE THE LEVEL OF THE SUITABILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE READY TO BE RELEASED- AND B. WE'RE HAVING THE DISCUSSION ABOUT FOR ALL PLANTS ANOTHER KEY ASPECT. TO GAUGE THAT LEVEL OF SUCCESS AND TO ENSURE THAT SUCCESS. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY- I ALSO CONSIDER THE NUMBERS THAT WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE 325% OF THE FELONIES AND MISDEMEANORS WITHIN THE THREE YEAR PERIOD OF BEING RELEASED THE LESS THAN ONE PERCENT. OF THE VIOLENT FELONIES AND THAT ALSO. CONFIRMS THAT THE WAY WE DO THINGS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO OTHER QUESTIONS THANK YOU SENATOR- I THINK I. GIVEN WHAT EVERYONE HAS GONE THROUGH I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION AND I'VE BEEN ON THE RULES COMMITTEE FOR A LITTLE WHILE NOW AND SO I THINK I HAVE SEEN ONE OR TWO OF YOU BEFORE- AT ONE POINT BEFORE- I WAS THE PRO TEM OF THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE. I BROUGHT UP AN ISSUE RELATED TO TRANSGENDER- THE TRANSGENDER AND GENDER NONCONFORMING INMATES. AND UNIQUE CHALLENGES AND AT THAT POINT I THINK. THE BOARD ARE LIMITED FURTHER TRAINING AND I JUST AM INTERESTED I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE HAD. MEMBERS OF THAT COMMUNITY COME FORWARD BUT A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND I JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP SINCE I HAVE THIS RARE OPPORTUNITY. TO SIT THROUGH ANOTHER CONFIRMATION HEARING AND ASK- AND I'M GONNA DO LIKE I DID LAST TIME AND SEE IF ANYONE WANTS TO ANSWER AND THEN ALL ALL LIKE KNOWLEDGE YOU. IF YOU HAVE IF THAT TRAINING NUMBER ONE YOU WERE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN WAS IT HELPFUL AND TO HAVE YOU HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO. ADDRESS ANY MEMBER OF THE TRANSGENDER OR GENDER NONCONFORMING. COMMUNITY AND ONE OF YOUR HEARINGS AND ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE TO RELATE TO. US AND I'LL IF ANYONE WANTS TO ANSWER I WOULD LOVE THAT ALL OF KNOWLEDGE YOU- YOU MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE HAD ANY CASES BUT- OKAY ARE. A GREAT COMMISSIONER DOGS I'LL GO TO YOU FIRST AND THEN- COMMISSIONER TYRA. THANK YOU- SO YES IHAVE HAD SEVERAL TRANSGENDER INMATES APPEAR BEFORE ME. AND- EMAIL LIKE ANY OTHER OF THE INMATES WHO ARE PREPARED FOR PAROLE THEY HAVE DONE THE WORK NECESSARY TO REALLY THINK ABOUT WHAT SUCCESSFUL LOOKS LIKE FOR THEM ON THE OUTSIDE AND CERTAINLY FOR TRANSGENDER PEOPLE. THEY HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES THAT THEY'LL HAVE TO FACE OUT THERE. AND I HAVE BEEN. PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY HOW WELL PREPARED THEY ARE TO FACE THOSE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES THAT GOES ALONG WITH THEIR GENDER STATUS- I BELIEVE THAT. THE CITY C. R. HAS DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB OF PROVIDING THEM WITH SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED ARMED THERE CAN ALWAYS BE IMPROVEMENTS I THINK THE AWARENESS IS THERE NOW TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY DO HAVE SOME UNIQUE CHALLENGES BEING IN CDC ARE ARMED AND SUPPORTS ARE IN PLACE TO HELP THEM BE SUCCESSFUL THAT- THOUGHTFUL RESPONSE COMMISSIONER TYRA. THANK YOU SENATOR RIGHT I'VE HAD A FEW TRANSGENDER INMATES I WOULD SAY IT'S VERY INFREQUENT I CAN COUNT- RECOLLECT MAYBE MAYBE TO A DURING MY- PRIOR TERM- BUT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT. WE TALK ABOUT IT THE HEARINGS- HOW THAT WOULD IMPACT THE PREPARATION FOR PAROLE AND THINGS TO CONSIDER UPON RELEASE AND I ECHO COMMISSIONER DOBBS THE IN. THE THE PEOPLE THAT I SEE HAVE A DONE A- MUCH MORE PLANNING AND THERE THERE'S MUCH MORE AWARENESS. OF WE TALK ABOUT HOW THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDRESSED- WE AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE NOT ONLY IDENTIFIED IN THE RECORDS WHICH IS A RELATIVELY NEW THING NOW. IT IS. DOCUMENTED IT SOMEWHERE IN THE PRISON RECORDS SO WE KNOW IN ADVANCE AND A IF WE DON'T WE TALK ABOUT IT SO THE AWARENESS IS THERE. AND IT IS- I'VE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO BY HEARING HEARINGS THAT I DO. QUESTIONER THANK YOU AND I COMMISSIONER DOBBS THANK YOU FOR REFERENCING CDC ARE BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH THEM. ABOUT YOU KNOW FEEDBACK WE'VE GOTTEN FROM.
