A BILL LIKE THIS I DO BELIEVE

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:12.932
CLIMATE CRISIS IS AN EXISTENTIAL

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:15.001

INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.610
I HAVE TO CONFESS DID NOT PAY

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:24.878
MUCH ATTENTION TO THE TWENTY

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.746
EIGHT PLATFORMS OFF THE COAST

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.781
OF CALIFORNIA I IS HE SAID

00:02:28.848 --> 00:02:29.883
THAT'S ACTIVELY BEEN SUBJECT A

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:31.217
MORATORIUM ON NEW DRILLING SINCE

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:32.785
THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES BUT THEN

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:34.387
THE EVENTS OF LAST FALL OCCURRED

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:36.422
AND AS YOU ALL KNOW IN OCTOBER

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.991
AND MAJOR OIL SPILL TOOK PLACE

00:02:38.057 --> 00:02:39.425
OFF THE COAST OF ORANGE COUNTY

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:40.827
RIGHT OFF OF HUNTINGTON BEACH

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:42.362
ORIGINATING FROM AN UNDERWATER

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:43.830
PIPELINE CONNECTED TO PLATFORM

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:45.832
ELLIE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:47.333
THOUSAND GALLONS OF OIL SPILLED

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.868
INTO COASTAL WATERS KILLING

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:50.537
BIRDS AND FISH FORCING BEACH

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:51.738
CLOSURES AND HURTING LOCAL

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:53.840
ECONOMIES IN HUNTINGTON BEACH

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:55.174
NEWPORT BEACH AND LAGUNA BEACH

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:56.676
WHICH IS THE CITIES I REPRESENT

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.411
IT TOOK NEARLY FIFTEEN HUNDRED

00:02:58.478 --> 00:02:59.779
PEOPLE IN ALMOST THREE MILLION

00:02:59.846 --> 00:03:01.281
DOLLARS TO CLEAN UP THE SPILL

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:02.916
NOT INCLUDING FEDERAL COSTS

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:04.584
AND FRANKLY WE DODGED A BULLET

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:06.352
THE HUNTINGTON BEACH OIL SPILL

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:07.387
WAS ORIGINALLY PREDICTED TO

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:09.255
BE MUCH MUCH WORSE ON AN ORDER

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:10.490
OF MAGNITUDE SIMILAR TO THE

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:11.925
REFUGIO BEACH OIL SPILL IN

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:13.860
TWENTY FIFTEEN WHICH SHUT DOWN

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:15.361
SANTA BARBARA COASTLINE FOR SIX

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:17.163
MONTHS FORTUNATELY THE SMELL

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.331
THIS BILL IS MUCH SMALLER THAN

00:03:18.398 --> 00:03:20.433
EXPECTED AND WE ALSO BENEFITED

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.968
FROM A TIMELY STORM THAT BLEW

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.303
IN THE NEXT NIGHT PUSHING MOST

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:24.704
OF THE OIL RESIDUE OUT TO SEA

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:26.773
AND WE FOR OUR COASTLINE BUT

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:27.907
NONE THE LESS THIS CLOSE OUR

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:30.476
BEACHES FOR A WEEK I HAD A

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.478
MASSIVE ECONOMIC IMPACT AND THEN

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:33.813
JUST AS WE'VE BEEN CUT BECAUSE

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.381
BEGUN RECOVERING FROM THIS EVENT

00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:36.816
ONLY TWO MONTHS AFTER THE SPILL

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.284
A RUPTURE OIL PIPELINE FROM

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:39.919
PLATFORM EVA EXPERIENCE ANOTHER

00:03:39.986 --> 00:03:42.388
LEAK NOW AS I SAID EARLIER

00:03:42.455 --> 00:03:43.556
I BELIEVE CLIMATE CHANGE IS A

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:45.558
PRESSING ISSUE FOR US BUT EVEN

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:46.993
IF YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THAT I

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.261
THINK IT'S CLEAR THAT THE RISKS

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:50.096
POSED BY OFFSHORE DRILLING ARE

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:51.864
NOT JUSTIFIED BY THEIR BENEFITS

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:53.766
OFFSHORE OIL PRODUCTION IN BOTH

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:55.001
FEDERAL AND STATE WATERS IN

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.703
CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTS FOR LESS

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.438
THAN POINT THREE PERCENT OF

00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:00.106
ANNUAL PRODUCTION UNITED STATES

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.708
THAT'S NOT EVEN A DROP IN THE

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:03.843
BUCKET AT THE SAME TIME THESE

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.578
OFFSHORE RIGS THREATEN A VIBRANT

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:07.046
CALIFORNIA COASTAL KANEMI THAT

00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:08.348
GENERATES FORTY FOUR BILLION

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:09.916
DOLLARS A YEAR IN ECONOMIC

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:11.618
ACTIVITY AND EMPLOYS OVER A HALF

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:13.753
MILLION CALIFORNIANS FULL

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.521
COASTLINE AND PRECIOUS MARINE

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:17.890
ECOSYSTEMS ARE ALSO CORE PART OF

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:19.626
AYE OUR IDENTITY IS CALIFORNIANS

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.260
NOT ONLY IN COASTAL COMMUNITIES

00:04:21.327 --> 00:04:22.829
LIKE THE ONES I REPRESENT BUT

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:24.597
ALSO ACROSS THE STATE PEOPLE

00:04:24.664 --> 00:04:26.532
FROM ENGLAND FLOCKED OUR BEACHES

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:27.700
AND COASTLINES BECAUSE THIS IS

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.135
PART OF WHO WE ARE A CORE PART

00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:31.204
OF WHO WE ARE CALIFORNIANS AND

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.039
LET'S BE CLEAR THE PLATFORMS

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.974
OFFER COSTAR KICKING TIME BOMBS

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:36.609
THE REMAINING LEASES ARE LARGELY

00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:38.478
HELD BY THINLY CAPITALIZED FIRMS

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:39.812
THAT DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.180
TO REPAY TAXPAYERS IN THE EVENT

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:42.448
OF ANOTHER MAJOR OIL SPILL

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:43.850
AND DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:45.284
INCENTIVES TO INVEST IN AGING

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:46.619
FOR INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WAS PUT

00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:47.920
IN PLACE IN NINETEEN SEVENTIES

00:04:47.987 --> 00:04:49.555
AND NINETEEN EIGHTIES ANOTHER

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.057
MAJOR OIL SPILL IS INEVITABLE

00:04:51.124 --> 00:04:52.592
UNLESS WE AND OFFSHORE DRILLING

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:54.794
IT'S TIME TO PUT AN END TO THE

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:56.362
USE OF THIS AGING INFRASTRUCTURE

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:57.997
AND AID THE STATE IS TRANSITION

00:04:58.064 --> 00:04:58.998
TOWARDS MORE SUSTAINABLE

00:04:59.065 --> 00:05:00.700
RESOURCE PROCUREMENT WE HAVE

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:01.701
AN APPROACH THAT WE BELIEVE IS

00:05:01.768 --> 00:05:03.870
FAIR TRANSPARENT AND WELL WE'LL

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:05.104
AN OFFSHORE DRILLING IN STATE

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:07.040
WATERS WITHIN TWO YEARS HERE'S

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:08.841
WHAT OUR BILL WOULD DO FIRST

00:05:08.908 --> 00:05:10.009
IT REQUIRES THE STATE LANDS

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:11.177
COMMISSION TO COMPLETE WITHIN

00:05:11.244 --> 00:05:13.212
ONE YEAR AN AMORTIZATION STUDY

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:14.614
ASSESSING THE FAIR MARKET VALUE

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:16.215
OF THESE LEASES INCLUDING BOTH

00:05:16.282 --> 00:05:18.384
THE ANTICIPATED PROFITS AND ALSO

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:20.286
IMPORTANTLY THE COST OF CAPPING

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:21.120
AND DECOMMISSIONING THESE

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:23.022
REQS WE PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:24.090
DISCRETION LANDS COMMISSION

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.758
TO CONDUCT THE STUDY AND WE

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:26.693
ANTICIPATE THAT THEY WILL

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:27.860
COME TO EXPLORE DIFFERENT

00:05:27.927 --> 00:05:29.028
OPTIONS FOR DECOMMISSIONING

00:05:29.095 --> 00:05:31.097
AS PART OF THEIR STUDY SECOND

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.065
OUR BILL WOULD DIRECT LANDS

00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:33.466
COMMISSION TO TRY TO NEGOTIATE

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:34.934
A VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT WITH THE

THE FINDINGS OF THE AFFIRMATION

00:05:41.474 --> 00:05:43.242
AMORTIZATION STUDY THIS IS THE

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:44.711
CORE PART OF OUR BILL WE ARE

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:46.345
HOPING THAT LANCE COMMISSION

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:47.747
AND THE OPERATORS CAN REACH

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:49.482
A VOLUNTARY SETTLEMENT AND WE

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:50.616
GIVE THEM A TWO YEAR WINDOW

THAT IS FRANKLY A MUCH BETTER

00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:18.738
DEAL FOR TAXPAYERS THAN THE

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:20.606

AS AS POTENTIALLY A MODEL FOR

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.228
FEDERAL LEGISLATION SO WE I'VE

00:26:03.295 --> 00:26:04.629

DIFFERENT PARTS THE ARE COUNTY

00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:11.269
COASTLINE KICK BUT THE REALITY

00:26:11.336 --> 00:26:12.904
IS IF IF THE RISK THAT WE'RE

00:26:12.971 --> 00:26:14.639

00:26:19.878 --> 00:26:21.079
LOOKING AT THE AT THE FINANCIAL

00:26:21.146 --> 00:26:22.314
ARCHITECTURE OF THIS BECAUSE I'M

GOT THIS THIRTY PERCENT OF THE

00:26:55.747 --> 00:26:57.349
PARTICULAR MATTER IN THE HARBOR

00:26:57.415 --> 00:26:58.216
THAT WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT WITH

00:26:58.283 --> 00:26:59.617
ASTHMA AND ALL THESE OTHER KIDS

00:26:59.684 --> 00:27:00.819
AND ALL THE IMPACTS ARE COMING

00:27:00.885 --> 00:27:02.354
ON THOSE TANKERS RIGHT IS THAT

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:04.522
A FAIR STATEMENT I'M NOT ABOUT

00:27:04.589 --> 00:27:05.724
RIGHT WHEN WAS I'M SORRY OKAY

00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:07.359
WE DID POINT IS IS THAT WHAT'S

00:27:07.425 --> 00:27:08.493
HAPPENING IS YOU'RE REPLACING

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.295
ONE RISK WITH ANOTHER RISK IN

00:27:10.362 --> 00:27:11.896
TERMS OF IF YOU'RE IN FACT GOING

00:27:11.963 --> 00:27:13.999
TO IMPORT OIL OFF OF TANKERS

00:27:14.232 --> 00:27:15.166
THEN YOU'RE SAYING OKAY WE'RE

00:27:15.233 --> 00:27:16.868
TO MOVING THE BEACH RISK BUT

00:27:16.935 --> 00:27:18.436
WE'RE ADDING AIR POLLUTION RISK

00:27:18.503 --> 00:27:19.704
AS A CONSEQUENCE YOU FORGET

00:27:19.771 --> 00:27:21.106
IMPORTANT LIST WILL BE INCREASED

00:27:21.172 --> 00:27:23.375
DRILLING HERE NUMBER ONE NUMBER

00:27:23.441 --> 00:27:25.977
TWO WHICH CONCERNS ME IN

00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:27.112
THE DISCUSSION I'VE HAD WITH YOU

00:27:27.178 --> 00:27:28.680
ALREADY AND I APPRECIATE YOUR

00:27:28.747 --> 00:27:29.981
EARNESTNESS WITH RESPECT TO THIS

00:27:30.048 --> 00:27:30.882
MEASURE BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING

00:27:30.949 --> 00:27:32.851
ABOUT A LONG TIME FOR THIS --

00:27:32.917 --> 00:27:34.853
STRUCTURE YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY

00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:35.787
DEALING WITH THIS BILL WHICH

00:27:35.854 --> 00:27:37.856
CAUSED BY A TANKER NOT BY THE

00:27:37.922 --> 00:27:39.557
WAY WAS IT WAS IT A TANKER THAT

00:27:39.624 --> 00:27:41.259
DRAG DRAG THE THE AND THE AND

00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:42.460
THEN THE ALARMS DIDN'T GO OFF

00:27:42.527 --> 00:27:43.862
OR THEY MAY HAVE GONE OFF BUT

00:27:43.928 --> 00:27:45.530
DIDN'T ALERT THEM BECAUSE THEY

00:27:45.597 --> 00:27:46.564
PROBABLY WEREN'T UPDATED WHAT

00:27:46.631 --> 00:27:47.999
IS THE STATE WE'RE WE'RE HERE

00:27:48.066 --> 00:27:49.434
WOOD WORRIES ME AND I DEALT WITH

00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:51.302
THIS IN REGARDS TO REEFS RIGHT

00:27:51.369 --> 00:27:52.303
I KNOW THERE WAS SOME ISSUE

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:54.205
ABOUT THAT WE PASS OF THE SENATE

00:27:54.272 --> 00:27:56.241
THREE TIMES WHERE WE SET UP

00:27:56.307 --> 00:27:58.243
ANIL WE ALIGNED INTERESTS IN A

00:27:58.309 --> 00:28:01.479
WAY AND I THINK THIS IS SENATOR

00:28:01.546 --> 00:28:03.515
-- LATER GET WITH THIS YEARS AGO

00:28:03.581 --> 00:28:05.750
HIMSELF WE'RE INNOCENT AND THOSE

00:28:05.817 --> 00:28:07.585
SPEAKER PEREZ DID THE SAME THING

00:28:07.652 --> 00:28:09.654
WE'RE TRYING TO ALIGN INTERESTS

00:28:09.854 --> 00:28:11.256
TO BE ABLE TO INCENTIVIZE

00:28:11.322 --> 00:28:13.158
THESE FOLKS TO ELIMINATE THESE

00:28:13.224 --> 00:28:14.492
OFFSHORE RIGS AND I KNOW THESE

00:28:14.559 --> 00:28:16.061
ARE AND SHALLOWER WATERS IN

00:28:16.127 --> 00:28:18.229
TERMS OF RIGS TO REEFS BUT

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:20.665
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE EXPOSED TO THIS

00:28:20.732 --> 00:28:23.168
EXTRAORDINARY TAXPAYER EXPENSE

00:28:23.435 --> 00:28:25.136
AND MONEY'S NOT PRINTED ON TREES

00:28:25.203 --> 00:28:26.104
SO YOU'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO

00:28:26.171 --> 00:28:27.505
TAKE THIS MONEY OUT OF FOSTER

00:28:27.572 --> 00:28:28.640
CARE -- WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT

00:28:28.706 --> 00:28:30.208
OUT OF MONEY THAT WE NEED TO

00:28:30.275 --> 00:28:32.343
BUILD HOUSING FOR HOMELESS WE IN

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:34.112
GOVERNMENT HAVE AN OBLIGATION AS

00:28:34.179 --> 00:28:36.581
WE SPEND TAX DOLLARS TO BALANCE

00:28:36.648 --> 00:28:38.383
IT'S EASY JUST TO SAY YES TO

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:39.951
EVERYBODY ALL THE TIME AND NOT

00:28:40.018 --> 00:28:41.286
BE RESPONSIBLE IN GOVERNMENT

00:28:41.352 --> 00:28:43.188
WHICH IS OUR JOB WHERE WE DON'T

00:28:43.254 --> 00:28:44.823
KNOW WHAT IS GOING TO COST WE

00:28:44.889 --> 00:28:46.691
KNOW THAT IF IF WE TAKE THESE

00:28:46.758 --> 00:28:48.093
THEY'RE CLEARLY IN THE LAW THIS

00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:50.095
IS A TAKING AND THE QUESTION IS

00:28:50.628 --> 00:28:52.630
I LOOK AT THIS AND QUITE FRANKLY

00:28:52.697 --> 00:28:54.265
AND AS I ANALYZED AFTER TALKING

00:28:54.332 --> 00:28:55.767
TO YOU AND TRYING TO GIVE YOU

00:28:55.834 --> 00:28:56.968
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND

00:28:57.035 --> 00:28:59.537
BEATING THE ANALYSIS IS TO SAY

00:28:59.604 --> 00:29:01.339
OKAY WHY DON'T WE JUST DO ONE

00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:03.007
OFF EACH ONE OF THESE WHY CAN'T

00:29:03.074 --> 00:29:04.342
WE DO TRADE OFFS IN TERMS OF

00:29:04.409 --> 00:29:05.743
NEGOTIATING EACH ONE YOU SET UP

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:07.045
THIS WHOLE PROCESS WITHIN THE

00:29:07.112 --> 00:29:09.147
BUREAUCRACY OF GOVERNMENT THEN

00:29:09.347 --> 00:29:12.150
TIES YOU TO THIS FRAMEWORK

00:29:12.217 --> 00:29:14.352
WHERE YOU COULD BASICALLY DOES

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:15.720
THIS ONE OF THESE COMPANIES WHAT

00:29:15.787 --> 00:29:17.789
AMY ESTHER ME WHATEVER THE THREE

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:19.824
PLATFORMS ARE CALLED DO YOU HAVE

00:29:19.891 --> 00:29:21.426
SOMETHING TO NEGOTIATE WHERE

00:29:21.493 --> 00:29:22.427
WHERE ONE OF THESE COMPANIES

00:29:22.494 --> 00:29:23.561
I DON'T HOLD THESE THINGS HAVE

00:29:23.628 --> 00:29:25.563
NO CLUE BUT OFTEN THE GO SHAKE

00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:26.831
SOMETHING WITH THEM TO REDUCE

00:29:26.898 --> 00:29:28.333
THE RISK ON THE GENERAL FUND

00:29:28.533 --> 00:29:30.335
THAT AFFECTS PEOPLE I I THINK

00:29:30.401 --> 00:29:32.137
THAT YOU PROBABLY COULD BUT NOW

00:29:32.203 --> 00:29:33.371
WHAT'S HAPPENED IS YOU'VE SET

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:35.440
UP THIS PROCESS AND I UNDERSTAND

00:29:35.507 --> 00:29:36.274
SO WORK IN PROGRESS AND I

00:29:36.341 --> 00:29:37.342
CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT I'VE

00:29:37.408 --> 00:29:38.710
BEEN THROUGH THIS MANY TIMES

00:29:39.043 --> 00:29:40.044
BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THE BASIC

00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:42.313
FRAMEWORK YOU'RE SAYING TO ME

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:43.915
IN THAT TO ASKING FOR FOR ME TO

00:29:43.982 --> 00:29:46.084
SUPPORT THIS THAT YOU KNOW YES

00:29:46.151 --> 00:29:47.752
OKAY FINE WE WANT TO DO ALL THIS

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:49.020
GREAT WE WANT TO GET THIS DONE

00:29:49.087 --> 00:29:50.522
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AGREE AGREE

00:29:50.588 --> 00:29:52.123
AGREE NO QUESTION BUT YOU'RE

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:54.392
NOT BALANCING IT AGAINST ONE OF

00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:55.960
THE OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:29:56.027 --> 00:29:57.595
ALL THE OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED

00:29:57.662 --> 00:29:58.763
WITH GOVERNMENT AND THEN YOU'RE

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:00.598
SETTING UP THIS FRAMEWORK WITH

00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:01.866
THE CALIFORNIA LANDS COMMISSION

00:30:01.933 --> 00:30:03.601
I WORKED WITH MANY MANY YEARS

00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:05.603
ON A NUMBER OF THINGS AND IT IT

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:07.772
IS QUITE PROBLEMATIC AND SO I

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:10.041
I JUST I GOTTA TELL YOU FROM MY

00:30:10.108 --> 00:30:12.043
PERSPECTIVE DO YOU KNOW UNLESS

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:14.379
YOU'RE BASICALLY SPENDING ALL

00:30:14.445 --> 00:30:16.381
THIS MONEY TO BEG ELIMINATE OIL

00:30:16.447 --> 00:30:18.416
COMPLETELY YOU'RE NOT REALLY

00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:19.651
SOLVING THE PROBLEM IN YOUR

00:30:19.717 --> 00:30:20.818
CREATING A WHOLE HOST OF NEW

00:30:20.885 --> 00:30:21.853
PROBLEMS I'D LIKE TO GET SOME

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:22.954
OF INSIGHT YOU HAVE A BRIGHT

00:30:23.021 --> 00:30:24.422
FELLA ON SOME OF THE STUFF

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:25.623
BUT I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.825
IT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S THE

00:30:27.892 --> 00:30:29.260
SAME THING HAPPENS IN THIS JOB

00:30:29.327 --> 00:30:30.628
ALL THE TIME PEOPLE COME IN ON

00:30:30.695 --> 00:30:32.197
ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER SIDE AND

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:33.831
THEY WANT TO YOU KNOW HAVE SOME

00:30:33.898 --> 00:30:34.832
POLITICAL THING THAT HAPPENED

00:30:34.899 --> 00:30:35.767
THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEY WANT

00:30:35.833 --> 00:30:37.635
TO MAKE A STATEMENT BUT WE HAVE

00:30:37.702 --> 00:30:39.637
A RESPONSIBILITY TO DEAL WITH

00:30:39.704 --> 00:30:41.506
THIS IN A REALLY INTELLIGENT

00:30:41.573 --> 00:30:43.141
WAY AND THAT MEANS SPENDING

00:30:43.208 --> 00:30:44.776
ARE THE TAXPAYERS DOLLARS IN

00:30:44.842 --> 00:30:46.911
THE WAY MOST EXPEDITIOUSLY

00:30:47.145 --> 00:30:49.380
AND IF YOU'RE OUT HERE TO STAY

00:30:49.447 --> 00:30:50.648
YOU'RE GOING TO ELIMINATE OIL

00:30:50.715 --> 00:30:51.883
WHAT ARE YOU REALLY DOING THAT

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.017
HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING ELSE IN

00:30:53.084 --> 00:30:54.886
TERMS THAT CONSEQUENCE RIGHT

00:30:55.119 --> 00:30:56.554
AND WHAT PRICE TO PAY AND

00:30:56.621 --> 00:30:57.689
ARE YOU PUTTING YOURSELF IN

00:30:57.755 --> 00:31:00.124
A FRAMEWORK THAT IS SO RIGID

00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:01.192
THAT YOU'RE BASICALLY SETTING

00:31:01.259 --> 00:31:03.228
A TONE THAT PUTS US IN A VERY

00:31:03.294 --> 00:31:04.829
DIFFICULT POSITION TO NEGOTIATE

00:31:04.896 --> 00:31:06.264
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THE

00:31:06.331 --> 00:31:08.132
BIG STORY THING WHERE THERE'S

00:31:08.199 --> 00:31:09.500
OPPORTUNITIES TO LOOK AT THIS

00:31:09.567 --> 00:31:10.868
THING IN A DIFFERENT WAY BUT

00:31:10.935 --> 00:31:11.936
I I'D LIKE TO GET SOME OF YOUR

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:13.037
THOUGHTS ON THIS BECAUSE I'M

00:31:13.104 --> 00:31:15.106
HAVING TROUBLE IT IN TERMS

00:31:15.173 --> 00:31:16.841
OF TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:31:16.908 --> 00:31:18.810
YOUR OBJECTIVE IS YEAH WITHOUT

00:31:18.876 --> 00:31:20.411
SEEING ALL OF THE HORRIBLE

00:31:20.478 --> 00:31:21.613
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND

00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:22.780
NOT REALLY GETTING TO THE ROOT

00:31:22.847 --> 00:31:23.615
OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM YOU'RE

00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:25.917
TRYING TO SOLVE THANK YOU CENTER

00:31:25.984 --> 00:31:27.752
AT THANK YOU OF COURSE PLEASE

00:31:27.819 --> 00:31:29.320
-- SO I THINK THERE MIGHT BE

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:31.322
SOME MISUNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE

00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:33.358
PURPOSE OF THIS BILL AND MAYBE

00:31:33.424 --> 00:31:35.159
THAT IS I WASN'T COMMUNICATING

00:31:35.226 --> 00:31:36.427
CLEARLY I THINK YOU ARE NOT

00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:37.528
HERE IN FORCING FOR MY OPENING

00:31:37.595 --> 00:31:39.197
STATEMENT OKAY BUT THE POINT

00:31:39.264 --> 00:31:40.765
IS BILLS NOT TO GET RID OIL

00:31:40.832 --> 00:31:41.933
WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE GET THE

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:42.900
STATE OFF WHERE THAT THAT'S

00:31:42.967 --> 00:31:44.269
A SECONDARY RIGHT THAT'S THE

00:31:44.335 --> 00:31:45.803
SUBJECT OF A WHOLE DIFFERENT

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:47.572
DEBATE THIS THIS IS A NARROWER

00:31:47.639 --> 00:31:50.141
GOAL WHICH IS IS ABOUT BALANCING

00:31:50.208 --> 00:31:51.743
AS YOU SAID BALANCING THE RISKS

00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:54.612
OF OFFSHORE OIL SPILLS THAT

00:31:54.679 --> 00:31:55.880
JEOPARDIZE OUR COASTLINE AND

00:31:55.947 --> 00:31:57.115
R. FORTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR

00:31:57.181 --> 00:31:59.450
ECONOMY IT AND THAT'S A REAL

00:31:59.517 --> 00:32:00.818
RISK AND WE'VE SEEN IT TIME

00:32:00.885 --> 00:32:02.520
AFTER TIME AND YES SOME OF

00:32:02.587 --> 00:32:04.188
THAT RISK IS AGGREGATED IN THE

00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:06.391
TANKERS A LOT OF IT THOUGH COMES

00:32:06.457 --> 00:32:08.426
FROM THE PLATFORMS AND IN THIS

00:32:08.493 --> 00:32:10.628
CASE IT WAS OIL FROM PLATFORM

00:32:10.828 --> 00:32:12.030
IT WAS A SHIP I I BELIEVE IT

00:32:12.096 --> 00:32:13.197
WAS IN THE TANKER WAS A CARGO

00:32:13.264 --> 00:32:15.466
SHIP IT MAY HAVE BEEN A TANKER

00:32:15.533 --> 00:32:16.868
BUT EITHER WAY IT WAS ABOUT AN

00:32:16.934 --> 00:32:18.870
EXPOSE PIPELINE IT WAS ABOUT AN

00:32:18.936 --> 00:32:21.039
ALARM THAT ALLEGEDLY WENT OFF

00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:22.473
BUT NOBODY ANSWERED IT AND AND

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.941
THAT SEEMS LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN

00:32:24.008 --> 00:32:26.110
A CASE OF NON INVESTMENT IN

00:32:26.177 --> 00:32:27.812
INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH IS ALL TOO

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:29.380
COMMON WITH THESE THINGS AND I

00:32:29.447 --> 00:32:30.682
THINK IN TALKING TO THE SENATE

00:32:30.748 --> 00:32:31.849
AND I APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP

00:32:31.916 --> 00:32:32.717
ON THE RIG THREE FINAL YOU

00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:34.485
KNOW A LOT ABOUT THIS ISSUE --

00:32:34.552 --> 00:32:36.354
BUT YOU ALSO KNOW THEN THAT A

00:32:36.421 --> 00:32:37.889
LOT OF THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS

00:32:38.089 --> 00:32:39.891
OLD IF THERE'S NO MEANINGFUL

00:32:39.957 --> 00:32:41.192
INCENTIVES FOR THE EXISTING

00:32:41.259 --> 00:32:43.161
OPERATORS WHO ARE YOU KNOW --

00:32:43.227 --> 00:32:44.595
TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS DOWN

00:32:44.662 --> 00:32:46.064
OTHER THE MAJORS ARE ALL OUT

00:32:46.397 --> 00:32:47.932
-- THE THEIR THINLY CAPITALIZED

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:48.766
THEY DON'T HAVE THE INCENTIVES

00:32:48.833 --> 00:32:50.001
TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE

00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:51.669
-- IN SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT

00:32:51.736 --> 00:32:53.104
INCENTIVES IS ABOUT RISKS AND

00:32:53.171 --> 00:32:54.272
BALANCING THOSE RISKS I THINK

00:32:54.339 --> 00:32:55.840
THIS FRAMEWORK DOES COME TO THAT

00:32:55.907 --> 00:32:56.641
BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT TRYING

00:32:56.708 --> 00:32:57.809
TO GET RID OF OIL IT'S ABOUT

00:32:58.076 --> 00:33:00.011
BALANCING THE RISKS OF SPILLS

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:01.179
FROM THESE WHAT I THINK ARE

00:33:01.245 --> 00:33:02.680
TICKING TIME BOMBS AND I THINK

00:33:03.081 --> 00:33:04.482
PEOPLE STUDY THIS AGREE WITH

00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:06.951
THAT -- AND AND THE REST

00:33:07.018 --> 00:33:08.619
SAY POSTCARDS ARE SHORT IN

00:33:08.686 --> 00:33:09.721
OUR OUR BEACHES AND I REALLY

00:33:09.787 --> 00:33:11.889
DO THINK THAT UNLESS WE STOP

00:33:11.956 --> 00:33:13.191
THE DRILLING WE WILL END UP

00:33:13.257 --> 00:33:14.425
INEVITABLY HAVING ANOTHER MAJOR

00:33:14.492 --> 00:33:16.160
MAJOR OIL SPILL WHETHER IT'S IN

00:33:16.227 --> 00:33:17.995
A YEAR TEN YEARS TWENTY YEARS

00:33:18.062 --> 00:33:18.963
WE'RE WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:21.532
HAPPEN -- UNSERE IS

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:22.367
NUMBER APPOINT SOMEONE TO GO

00:33:22.433 --> 00:33:24.469
THROUGH THEM -- THE COSTS -- AND

00:33:24.535 --> 00:33:25.603
I SHOULD ALSO SAY THIS IS NOT

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:27.004
ON FOR DRILLING OIL PRODUCTION

00:33:27.071 --> 00:33:28.272
THIS BILL IS LIMITED TO THE

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:30.274
THREE PLATFORMS WITH THE HOPE OF

00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:31.676
PROVIDING EXAMPLE FOR THE OTHER

00:33:31.743 --> 00:33:33.411
TWENTY FOUR PLATFORMS IN FEDERAL

00:33:33.478 --> 00:33:35.012
WATERS THEN AGAIN I KNOW THAT

00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:35.980
OUR CONGRESSIONAL COUNTERPARTS

00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:37.215
ARE BIT CLICK VERY CLOSELY

00:33:37.281 --> 00:33:38.282
FOLLOWING WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT

00:33:38.349 --> 00:33:40.051
NOW WITH THIS BILL -- THEY MAY

00:33:40.118 --> 00:33:41.052
USE THIS IS A MODEL THEY MAY

00:33:41.119 --> 00:33:42.553
NOT BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT DEPENDS

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:43.621
ON WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS BILL

00:33:43.688 --> 00:33:44.555
ON THIS COMMITTEE AND GOING

00:33:44.622 --> 00:33:47.258
FORWARD -- YOU KNOW THE COST

00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:48.092
OF THIS BILL WE THINK WILL BE

00:33:48.159 --> 00:33:49.627
CONSTRAINED IN AGAIN I EMPHASIZE

00:33:49.694 --> 00:33:50.795
THE POINT THAT THIS THIS

00:33:50.862 --> 00:33:53.831
FRAMEWORK ACTUALLY INCORPORATES

00:33:53.898 --> 00:33:55.066
THE UP UP FRONT THE COST OF

00:33:55.133 --> 00:33:56.567
DECOMMISSIONING IN A WAY THAT

00:33:56.634 --> 00:33:57.435
I THINK IS A BETTER DEAL TO

00:33:57.502 --> 00:33:59.036
TAXPAYERS THAN THE ALTERNATIVE

00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:01.172
WE SAW THIS WITH PLATFORM HOLLY

00:34:01.239 --> 00:34:02.974
UNFORTUNATELY WHERE THE COST

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:03.975
OF DECOMMISSIONING SHOULD HAVE

00:34:04.041 --> 00:34:05.576
BEEN PAID FOR BY THE OPERATOR

00:34:05.877 --> 00:34:07.145
I THEY DECLARE BANKRUPTCY AND

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:08.446
LEFT US HOLDING BACK AND I THINK

00:34:08.513 --> 00:34:10.348
UNFORTUNATELY THE THE MOST THE

00:34:10.415 --> 00:34:11.382
COMPANIES HOLDING THESE AYE

00:34:11.449 --> 00:34:13.184
SO DITE DE CORPORATE DIE CORP

00:34:13.751 --> 00:34:14.619
WHICH I BELIEVE IS HOUSTON

00:34:14.685 --> 00:34:16.988
BASED COMPANY ALSO LEASES

00:34:17.054 --> 00:34:18.556
AND OPERATES TO THE PLATFORMS

00:34:18.623 --> 00:34:19.490
OF THE THREE WERE TALKING AT

00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:21.292
THE OTHERS OPERATED BY C. R. C.

00:34:21.759 --> 00:34:23.795
AND -- YOU KNOW MY BELIEF IS

00:34:23.861 --> 00:34:24.629
THAT IF WE HAVE ANOTHER MAJOR

00:34:24.695 --> 00:34:25.696
OIL SPILL OR WE HAVE ANOTHER

00:34:25.763 --> 00:34:27.064
MAJOR A SET OF DECOMMISSIONING

00:34:27.131 --> 00:34:28.933
COSTS WE WE MAY FACE THAT SAME

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.035
DILEMMA OF A COMPANY WALKING

00:34:31.102 --> 00:34:32.136
WAY DECLARING BANKRUPTCY AND

00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:33.037
LEAVING TAXPAYERS HOLDING THE

00:34:33.104 --> 00:34:34.772
BAG SO AT LEAST THIS APPROACH --

00:34:34.839 --> 00:34:36.441
INCORPORATES UP FRONT THE COST

00:34:36.507 --> 00:34:38.609
OF DECOMMISSIONING IT GETS RID

00:34:38.676 --> 00:34:41.112
OF THE RISKS OF OFFSHORE SPILLS

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:42.246
FROM THESE RIGS AGAIN I KNOW

00:34:42.313 --> 00:34:43.381
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS IN WHICH

00:34:43.448 --> 00:34:45.116
OFFERS BILLS CAN HAPPEN BUT IT

00:34:45.183 --> 00:34:46.951
DOES REMOVE THAT RISK AND WE

00:34:47.018 --> 00:34:47.952
THINK THAT IT DOESN'T LINE IN

00:34:48.019 --> 00:34:49.787
SENTENCE IN THAT IT PROVIDES THE

00:34:49.854 --> 00:34:52.423
POWER AND TOOLS FOR PLANTS TO BE

00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:53.791
ABLE TO NEGOTIATE A SETTLEMENT

00:34:53.858 --> 00:34:54.725
THAT'S WITH THE GOAL OF THIS

00:34:54.792 --> 00:34:56.527
FRAMEWORK YOU CAN'T NEGOTIATE

00:34:56.594 --> 00:34:57.862
A SETTLEMENT WITHOUT KNOWING

00:34:58.062 --> 00:34:59.130
WHAT THE FAIR MARKET VALUES

00:34:59.197 --> 00:35:00.164
I'M NOT GOING TO GO IN AND DID

00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:01.532
ON YOU KNOW SOMETHING ON EBAY

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:02.633
WITHOUT HAVING SOME SENSE OF

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:04.101
THE CONDITION OF THAT WHAT IT'S

00:35:04.168 --> 00:35:05.603
WORTH I WOULD THAT'S WHAT REALLY

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:06.871
AUTHORIZING LANDS COMMISSION

00:35:06.938 --> 00:35:08.339
TO DO WE DO ANTICIPATE THERE

00:35:08.406 --> 00:35:09.340
WILL BE AN APPROPRIATION FOR

00:35:09.407 --> 00:35:11.175
THIS AND TRYING TO COME TO A

00:35:11.242 --> 00:35:12.543
FAIR DEAL AND AND THAT'S REALLY

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.278
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT THERE'S BEEN

00:35:14.345 --> 00:35:15.546
SOME DISCUSSION WITH STEP UP

00:35:15.613 --> 00:35:16.881
ABOUT WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATE

00:35:16.948 --> 00:35:18.249
TO HAVE A TERMINATION CLAUSE

00:35:18.616 --> 00:35:19.550
WE FEEL LIKE THEY NEED THAT

00:35:19.617 --> 00:35:21.385
NEGOTIATING POWER TO BE ABLE

00:35:21.452 --> 00:35:23.020
TO NEGOTIATE A FAIR DEAL BUT

00:35:23.087 --> 00:35:23.821
IT'S SOMETHING WE'LL CONTINUE

00:35:23.888 --> 00:35:25.957
TO DISCUSS WITH CHIP -- WISPA

00:35:26.224 --> 00:35:27.792
I AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS SHOULD

00:35:27.859 --> 00:35:28.759
THIS BILL NEVADA COMMITTEE

00:35:28.826 --> 00:35:30.795
TODAY IT WE WANT TO PROVIDE A

00:35:30.862 --> 00:35:33.264
FRAMEWORK AND ROBUST SET OF

00:35:33.331 --> 00:35:34.765
TOOLS FOR INDIGO SHOULD HAPPEN

00:35:34.832 --> 00:35:36.000
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY IN EVERYONE'S

00:35:36.067 --> 00:35:37.335
INTERESTS ARE BECAUSE THE

00:35:37.401 --> 00:35:38.469
WRISTLET ADDITION ARE THERE

00:35:38.536 --> 00:35:39.537
THE CONSULATE ADDITION COULD

00:35:39.604 --> 00:35:41.172
BE HIGH AND WE LIKE TO TRY TO

00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:42.640
AVOID THAT BUT WE DO THINK THE

00:35:42.707 --> 00:35:44.275
COSTS WILL BE MORE MANAGEABLE

00:35:44.342 --> 00:35:45.676
THAN SOME HAVE PREDICTED --

00:35:45.743 --> 00:35:46.677
WE DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S NOT

00:35:46.744 --> 00:35:47.812
MUCH OIL LEFT IN THESE THREE

00:35:47.879 --> 00:35:49.480
PLATFORMS I HAVE BACK OF THE

00:35:49.547 --> 00:35:50.781
ENVELOPE NUMBERS FROM ONE OF

00:35:50.848 --> 00:35:52.049
THE PLATFORMS I'M HAPPY TO TALK

00:35:52.116 --> 00:35:54.018
WITH YOU OFFLINE ABOUT THOSE --

00:35:54.085 --> 00:35:55.119
BUT WE DO WE DON'T THINK THIS

00:35:55.186 --> 00:35:56.087
IS GOING TO BE IN THE BILLIONS

00:35:56.153 --> 00:35:57.788
WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE --

00:35:57.855 --> 00:35:58.890
YOU KNOW SOMETHING MUCH LESS

00:35:58.956 --> 00:35:59.724
THAN AND I DON'T WANT TO THE

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:00.791
RIGHT NUMBERS BUT BUT WE THINK

00:36:00.858 --> 00:36:02.093
IT'S MANAGEABLE AND IN THE

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:03.494
CONTEXT AGAIN -- FORTY FOUR

00:36:03.561 --> 00:36:04.862
BILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL COASTAL

00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:06.564
KANEMI WE THINK THAT THIS

00:36:06.631 --> 00:36:08.332
BILL IS A PARTICULARLY FACTOR

00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:10.001
IN DECOMMISSIONING COSTS IS

00:36:10.067 --> 00:36:11.469
ACTUALLY GOOD DEAL FOR TAXPAYERS

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:12.570
AT A TIME WE HAVE A RECORD

00:36:12.637 --> 00:36:13.804
SURPLUS IT'S NOT ABOUT MONEY

00:36:13.871 --> 00:36:15.072
GROWING ON TREES IT'S ABOUT

00:36:15.139 --> 00:36:17.041
MANAGING LONG TERM RISK AND AND

00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:19.176
TRYING TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT

00:36:19.243 --> 00:36:20.144
BECAUSE I I THINK WE ALL KNOW

00:36:20.211 --> 00:36:22.179
OIL SPILLS ARE DEVASTATING IN MY

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:23.514
DISTRICT ALONG WITH SEVEN DAYS

00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:25.816
OF SHUT DOWN BEACHES THE CONCERT

00:36:25.883 --> 00:36:26.751
ANY PRETTY PRETTY HIGH FROM

00:36:26.817 --> 00:36:28.286
THAT IF THEY HAD BEEN AS SEVERE

00:36:28.352 --> 00:36:30.021
AS REFUGIO WHERE THE BEACHES

00:36:30.087 --> 00:36:31.422
WERE SHUT DOWN FOR SIX MONTHS I

00:36:31.489 --> 00:36:32.723
HAVEN'T SEEN A STUDY OF ECONOMIC

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:34.091
IMPACTS OF THAT BUT SIX MONTHS

00:36:34.158 --> 00:36:35.426
OF SHUT DOWN BEACHES AND PLACES

00:36:35.493 --> 00:36:36.727
LIKE WE'RE GOING TO NEWPORT

00:36:36.794 --> 00:36:38.262
AND HUNTINGTON I'M GONNA HAVE

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:39.630
MASSIVE COST AS YOU KNOW THE

00:36:39.697 --> 00:36:40.865
HUNTING THE HUNTING BEACH OIL

00:36:40.932 --> 00:36:42.700
SPILL SHUT DOWN THE SECOND DAY

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:45.703
OF THE AIR SHOW WE HAD A MILLION

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.238
A HALF THE TOURISTS IN TOWN

00:36:47.438 --> 00:36:48.472
THEY WERE GONNA GO OUT TO BARS

00:36:48.539 --> 00:36:49.707
GONNA GO OUT BE ON THE BEACH

00:36:49.907 --> 00:36:51.242
ARE THEY ALL WENT HOME INSTEAD

00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:52.310
AND SO I TALKED TO NUMEROUS

00:36:52.376 --> 00:36:53.711
SHOP OWNERS WHO ESTIMATED THE

00:36:53.778 --> 00:36:55.613
LOSS YOU KNOW A HUGE DAY OF

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:56.847
REVENUES BECAUSE THAT THEN THE

00:36:56.914 --> 00:36:58.583
WEEK FOLLOWING -- WHEN THERE'S

00:36:58.649 --> 00:37:00.184
NO REVENUE -- THEY THEY SUFFERED

00:37:00.251 --> 00:37:02.119
AS WELL I ONE SHOP OWNER TOLD ME

00:37:02.186 --> 00:37:03.454
SHE LOST ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF

00:37:03.521 --> 00:37:05.423
HER MONTHLY INCOME ON AGAIN IT

00:37:05.489 --> 00:37:06.891
COULD'VE BEEN MUCH MUCH WORSE IF

00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:08.259
IF THIS BILL HAD BEEN AS BAD AS

00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:10.528
EXPECTED SO -- CONNECTIONS ONE

00:37:10.595 --> 00:37:12.763
FOLLOW YEAH AND OKAY GOOD YEAH

00:37:12.830 --> 00:37:13.931
I JUST AMEND LISTENING TO YOU

00:37:13.998 --> 00:37:15.433
IF YOU'RE TELLING US THAT MAHOOD

00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:17.468
PURPOSE SO CONCERNED IF YOUR

00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:18.736
PURPOSE IS NOT TO GET RID OF

00:37:18.803 --> 00:37:20.271
OIL IF THAT'S WHAT YOUR PURPOSE

00:37:20.571 --> 00:37:21.906
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'VE SET

00:37:21.973 --> 00:37:24.475
UP A STRUCTURE THAT BASICALLY

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:26.677
PUTS THE TAXPAYER INCH IN THE

00:37:26.744 --> 00:37:28.512
JACKPOT OKAY AND HERE'S THE

00:37:28.579 --> 00:37:30.381
REASON WHY IF I DON'T KNOW WHO

00:37:30.448 --> 00:37:31.649
THESE COMPANIES ARE OF THE OF

00:37:31.716 --> 00:37:33.217
ON SHORE OIL BUT BEFORE EITHER

00:37:33.284 --> 00:37:35.219
GONNA STOP GETTING AWFUL FOR NOT

00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:36.754
THEN WE'VE GOT TWO OPTIONS PUMP

00:37:36.821 --> 00:37:38.022
MORE FROM CALIFORNIA I'M NOT

00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:39.090
SUGGESTING THAT THE RIGHT THING

00:37:39.156 --> 00:37:40.091
TO DO AND THAT'S GIVING YOU A

00:37:40.157 --> 00:37:42.059
HYPOTHETICAL AGAINST PROFESSOR

00:37:42.293 --> 00:37:43.694
AND THEN THE SECOND THING IS WE

00:37:43.761 --> 00:37:44.929
CAN IMPORT THOSE ARE ONLY TWO

00:37:44.996 --> 00:37:46.664
OPTIONS OKAY BRING IT FROM OVER

00:37:46.731 --> 00:37:47.832
THERE AND ALL THE VARIOUS ISSUES

00:37:47.898 --> 00:37:49.166
ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUNKER FUEL

00:37:49.233 --> 00:37:50.635
AND ALL THOSE PROBLEMS BUT THE

00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:51.702
WHOLE YOU'RE THINKING OF IS

00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:53.070
NOT TO GET RID OF OIL YOU'VE

00:37:53.137 --> 00:37:54.505
LIMITED YOUR SKILL YOUR ABILITY

00:37:54.572 --> 00:37:55.740
TO GET SOMETHING DONE BECAUSE

00:37:55.806 --> 00:37:56.807
IF YOUR PURPOSE IS TO PROTECT

00:37:56.874 --> 00:37:58.809
THE BEACH LEGIT LEGIT LEGIT OKAY

00:37:59.477 --> 00:38:01.345
BUT YOU CAN GO AND WORK OUT WITH

00:38:01.412 --> 00:38:02.947
THESE COMPANIES IS YOU'VE GOT TO

00:38:03.014 --> 00:38:04.782
PAY BASIC RESEARCHER MISSING ONE

00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:06.283
INSTEAD OF PUTTING THE TAXPAYERS

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:07.685
AND JUG JEOPARDY YOU CAN GO TO

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:08.819
THIS COMPANIES SAY YOU'RE MAKING

00:38:08.886 --> 00:38:10.187
FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

ON THIS PROJECT WE'LL GIVE YOU

00:38:11.722 --> 00:38:12.890
A RESOURCE OVER HERE TO MAKE

00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:14.158
FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

00:38:14.225 --> 00:38:15.326
BUT YOU'RE LIMITING THAT THAT'S

00:38:15.393 --> 00:38:16.961
NOT HAPPENING AS OF AS AN OPTION

00:38:17.228 --> 00:38:18.629
SECOND THING YOU'RE DOING YOU'RE

00:38:18.696 --> 00:38:19.664

00:38:23.934 --> 00:38:25.403
SITUATION WITH PLATFORM HOLLY

BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

00:38:26.704 --> 00:38:28.305
WHEN I INTRODUCED A BILL THAT

00:38:28.372 --> 00:38:30.441
LOOKED TO TO TO CREATE A LARGER

00:38:30.708 --> 00:38:32.009
BOND REQUIRED QUICK BECAUSE

00:38:32.076 --> 00:38:33.344
THESE COMPANIES WERE BEING SOLD

00:38:33.411 --> 00:38:35.079
OUT TO SMALLER COMPANIES WE

00:38:35.146 --> 00:38:35.980
THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE LIKE

00:38:36.047 --> 00:38:37.148
THIRTY MILLION FIFTY MILLION A

00:38:37.214 --> 00:38:38.182

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:40.985
MILLION EXCUSE ME SHE JUST

00:38:41.052 --> 00:38:42.386

YOU HAVE TO PAY IN COMPENSATION

00:38:51.529 --> 00:38:52.430
AND THEN SECONDLY YOU'RE STILL

00:38:52.496 --> 00:38:53.798
EXPOSING THEM TO THE RISK OF

00:38:53.864 --> 00:38:56.133
REMOVING THE RIG I I JUST YOU

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.334

DOWN BEYOND JUST THE NOTION OF

00:39:08.746 --> 00:39:09.947
SAYING LET'S GET RID OF THESE

00:39:10.014 --> 00:39:11.649
THINGS WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING

00:39:11.716 --> 00:39:12.883
THE GLOCK LAVIN INTENDED

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:14.852
CONSEQUENCES AND IN MY JUDGMENT

00:39:14.919 --> 00:39:16.153
OFTEN ISSUE MISTER CHAIRMAN

00:39:16.220 --> 00:39:18.489
WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING ALL ON

00:39:18.689 --> 00:39:19.890
THE BIGGER PICTURE OF WHAT YOUR

THANK YOU FOR YOUR FEEDBACK

00:39:25.796 --> 00:39:27.998
-- THE COLLOQUY CENTER LAYERED

00:39:29.767 --> 00:39:31.569
THANK YOU MR -- THANK YOU MISTER

00:39:31.635 --> 00:39:34.338
CHAIR -- I THINK THE DEBATE

00:39:34.405 --> 00:39:36.774
HAS DONE A LOT OF THE WORK THAT

00:39:36.841 --> 00:39:38.642
THAT I WANTED TO DO BECAUSE I

00:39:38.709 --> 00:39:41.112
APPRECIATE THE CHAIR'S COMMENTS

00:39:41.178 --> 00:39:43.347
ABOUT GIVING A CHANCE TO WORK

00:39:43.414 --> 00:39:45.683
BUT I APPRECIATE US SENATOR

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.151
HERTZBERG'S COMMENTS ABOUT

00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:48.652
RAISING THE ISSUE FOR ME

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:49.620
THE THING I WAS GOING TO ASK

00:39:49.687 --> 00:39:51.088
ABOUT THAT HE JUST REALLY

00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:53.758
I WAS GONNA SAY DROP DOWN ON

00:39:53.824 --> 00:39:55.226
THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT PHRASE HERE

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:58.295
-- WAS THE ISSUE OF LIABILITY

00:39:58.496 --> 00:40:00.297
AND LIABILITY TO THE TAXPAYERS

00:40:00.364 --> 00:40:01.632
AND THAT IS A CONCERN AND THAT

00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:03.400
IS SOMETHING THAT THAT NEEDS

00:40:03.467 --> 00:40:04.969
TO BE ADDRESSED CLEARLY IN THIS

00:40:05.035 --> 00:40:07.071
BECAUSE HE HE I DID DEAL WITH

00:40:07.138 --> 00:40:09.206
THE EXACT SAME THING HE WAS

00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:10.975
TALKING ABOUT ABOUT ORSON WELLES

00:40:11.041 --> 00:40:12.510
AND THE ESCALATING COSTS WE DID

00:40:12.576 --> 00:40:14.211
OF THE BILL IN OUR LAST WEEK

00:40:14.945 --> 00:40:17.181
ON THAT THAT I THINK WE

00:40:18.215 --> 00:40:20.518
WHEN WE ACTED ON IN

00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:23.020
DEFENSE OF OF WHAT WE SHOULD

00:40:23.087 --> 00:40:25.289
BE DOING OTHER RIGS TO REEF

00:40:25.723 --> 00:40:27.725
I WAS GONNA MENTION AND SENATOR

00:40:27.792 --> 00:40:30.161
HERTZBERG REALLY HIT IT ON THE

00:40:30.227 --> 00:40:31.829
FACT THAT THIS IS THESE ARE

00:40:31.896 --> 00:40:33.297
IN SHALLOW WATERS THAT'S NOT

00:40:33.364 --> 00:40:36.066
AN OPTION HERE AND THE RISK

00:40:36.634 --> 00:40:39.069
IN THE IS SO OUR OUR

00:40:39.136 --> 00:40:41.372
I AM INCLINED TO GIVE YOU THE

00:40:41.438 --> 00:40:43.140
CHANCE TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES

00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:45.042
AND MOVE ALONG THE THING THAT

00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:47.211
I VOWED I WOULD START TO DO IS

00:40:47.278 --> 00:40:49.180
THIS ANALYSIS SAYS THIS IS A

00:40:49.246 --> 00:40:50.481
WORK IN PROGRESS AND WE HAVE

00:40:50.548 --> 00:40:51.949
ANOTHER BILL LATER IN THAT

00:40:52.016 --> 00:40:53.050
COMMITTEE HEARING IT SAYS IT'S

00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:54.885
A WORK IN PROGRESS AND -- I

00:40:54.952 --> 00:40:56.320
THOUGHT I'M GONNA START TO ASK

00:40:56.387 --> 00:40:58.055
ABOUT ALL THE WORKS IN PROGRESS

00:40:58.355 --> 00:41:00.090
TO FIND OUT HOW DO YOU THINK

00:41:00.157 --> 00:41:01.425
YOU'RE GOING TO GET TO THE END

00:41:01.492 --> 00:41:03.427
THE L. ONE IS GOING TO STOP

00:41:03.494 --> 00:41:05.462
BEING A WORK IN PROGRESS AND

00:41:05.529 --> 00:41:07.097
WHAT ARE THE CONVERSATIONS THAT

00:41:07.164 --> 00:41:09.400
WILL GET YOU THERE RENT AND WHO

00:41:09.466 --> 00:41:12.002
WITH THAT AND WHERE DO YOU THINK

00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:13.904
YOUR PATH IS IF IF YOU MOVE

00:41:13.971 --> 00:41:15.606
THIS BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE SURE

00:41:15.673 --> 00:41:16.841
AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION

00:41:16.907 --> 00:41:18.709
SENATOR FIRST OF ALL ON THE

00:41:18.776 --> 00:41:19.810
LIABILITY TAXPAYERS WHICH IS

00:41:19.877 --> 00:41:20.711
SOMETHING WE'D BE HAPPY TO

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:21.912
DISCUSS WITH YOU GOING FORWARD

00:41:21.979 --> 00:41:22.680
AND AND TO THINK ABOUT SOME

00:41:22.746 --> 00:41:23.948
OF THE MECHANISMS THAT SENATOR

00:41:24.014 --> 00:41:26.317
HERTZBERG AYE HAS RAISED AS YOU

00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:27.384
POINT OUT THESE ARE UNLIKELY

00:41:27.451 --> 00:41:29.553
CANDIDATES FOR EXTRA REEF OUT

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:31.422
WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT LANDS

00:41:31.488 --> 00:41:33.224
COMMISSION IN H. FOR THIS BILL

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:34.892
MOVE FORWARD -- IN CONDUCTING

00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:38.028
AMORTIZATION STUDY WOULD SS

00:41:38.095 --> 00:41:40.764
AND EXPLORE ALL DIFFERENT

00:41:40.831 --> 00:41:42.266
AVENUES FOR THE USE OF THESE

00:41:42.333 --> 00:41:43.934
REEFS ERROR THESE USE --

00:41:44.001 --> 00:41:46.604
PLATFORMS AND -- THAT IS

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.172
SOMETHING WE HOPE IS PART OF

00:41:48.239 --> 00:41:50.040
THE NEGOTIATION PROCESS IS COULD

00:41:50.107 --> 00:41:51.041
THIS BE USED FOR ALTERNATIVE

00:41:51.108 --> 00:41:52.610
USES AND AND DOES THAT CHANGE

00:41:52.676 --> 00:41:54.612
THE CALCULUS AS FAR AS THE

00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:55.880
COST OF DECOMMISSIONING TO THE

00:41:55.946 --> 00:41:58.048
TAXPAYER OR OTHERWISE -- AS FAR

00:41:58.115 --> 00:41:59.884
AS OUR PATHWAY FORWARD OBVIOUSLY

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:02.052
WE ARE ENGAGED WITH BOTH

00:42:02.119 --> 00:42:03.988
OUR SUPPORTERS IN OPPOSITION

00:42:04.521 --> 00:42:05.723
WE FEEL LIKE THIS BILLS ALREADY

00:42:05.789 --> 00:42:07.291
MOVED A LONG WAY WITH SOME OF

00:42:07.358 --> 00:42:08.792
OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH OPPOSITION

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.361
AS YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OTHER

00:42:10.427 --> 00:42:11.595
REPRESENTATIVE FROM SEEP UP

00:42:12.396 --> 00:42:13.230
MENTION THAT AT THIS POINT

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:14.531
THEY'RE ONLY OPPOSED TO THE

00:42:14.732 --> 00:42:17.501
TERMINATION CLAUSE THAT BEING

00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:19.069
SAID EVEN IF WE GET TO A POINT

00:42:19.136 --> 00:42:20.204
WHERE WE AN AGREEMENT WITH

00:42:20.271 --> 00:42:21.171
SOME OF THE OPPOSITION THERE

00:42:21.238 --> 00:42:21.939
THERE'S SOME OF THE ISSUES

00:42:22.006 --> 00:42:22.940
THAT YOU AND SENATOR HERTZBERG

00:42:23.007 --> 00:42:24.475
HAVE RAISED ABOUT MAKING SURE

00:42:24.541 --> 00:42:25.776
THIS IS THIS WE RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:27.611
TAXPAYERS I IS THAT SOMETHING

00:42:27.678 --> 00:42:28.812
WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH

00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:30.147
STAFF OF COMMITTEES MOVING

00:42:30.214 --> 00:42:32.249
FORWARD THIS STAFF YOUR STAFF

00:42:32.316 --> 00:42:33.450
IN YOURSELF IF YOU IF YOU TO

00:42:33.517 --> 00:42:35.719
BE SO INCLINED LANDS COMMISSION

00:42:35.786 --> 00:42:38.088
AND OTHER FOLKS INVOLVED WITH

00:42:38.155 --> 00:42:39.123
THIS THEY'LL BE MINISTERING THIS

00:42:39.189 --> 00:42:40.858
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE BEST

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:42.393
PATHWAY FORWARD THAT PROTECTS

00:42:42.459 --> 00:42:44.662
TAXPAYERS GETS TO OUR GOAL OF

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:46.630
ENDING THESE PLATFORMS IN A WAY

00:42:46.697 --> 00:42:48.432
THAT IS FAIR TRANSPARENT AND --

00:42:48.999 --> 00:42:51.635
MINIMIZES LITIGATION RISK THEN

00:42:51.702 --> 00:42:53.570
-- AND MAKE A COMMENT I'D BE

00:42:53.637 --> 00:42:54.738
HAPPY TO DO IT I WISH I STILL

00:42:54.805 --> 00:42:56.307
HAD TO STAFF RESOURCES BECAUSE

00:42:56.373 --> 00:42:57.241
THEY'D BE THE ONES THAT WOULD

00:42:57.308 --> 00:42:58.876
BE BEST TO ENGAGE WITH YOU

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.379
UP ON THIS BUT THE ARE

00:43:02.446 --> 00:43:04.248
-- IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

00:43:04.315 --> 00:43:05.416
ME THAT YOU DO THE DRESSES

00:43:05.482 --> 00:43:07.885
ISSUES IF THIS MOVES ALONG AN

00:43:07.952 --> 00:43:10.721
ENDED AND I A I NOTED

00:43:10.788 --> 00:43:12.456
THAT THE THAT THERE WAS SORT

00:43:12.523 --> 00:43:13.891
OF A MOVE TO NEUTRALITY ON ONE

00:43:13.958 --> 00:43:15.159
PART OF THE BILL OR AT LEAST

00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:16.493
SOME MEASURE OF ACCEPTANCE

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.795
SAID AND THE THING THAT WE

00:43:17.861 --> 00:43:19.697
HAVE OUTLINED IS THE REMAINING

00:43:19.763 --> 00:43:20.497
THING WHERE THERE'S STILL

00:43:20.564 --> 00:43:22.733
SOME CONCERN AND AND I THINK

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.269
ONE OF THE HARDEST ISSUES ARE

00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:28.472
ALWAYS IT IS THE ISSUE OF

00:43:28.539 --> 00:43:30.574
LIMITING MORAL PRODUCTION HERE

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:33.110
AND THE OPTIONS OF TANKERS OR

00:43:33.577 --> 00:43:35.713
OIL TRAINS OR OTHER THINGS THAT

00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:37.114
THAT ARE REALLY GOOD IT'S A

00:43:37.181 --> 00:43:38.315
QUESTION OF WHICH WAY ARE WE

00:43:38.382 --> 00:43:39.817
GOING TO TAKE ARE POISONED AND

00:43:39.883 --> 00:43:42.152
SO ARE I AM INCLINED TO MOVE

00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:43.487
THIS BILL ALONG AND GIVE YOU A

00:43:43.554 --> 00:43:45.489
CHANCE TO CONTINUE TO WORK BUT I

00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:46.757
WOULD HOPE THAT YOU COULD FIGURE

00:43:46.824 --> 00:43:48.125
OUT HOW TO GET TO THE END SOONER

00:43:48.192 --> 00:43:49.560
RATHER THAN LATER WE'RE WE'RE

00:43:49.626 --> 00:43:50.995
TRYING AND I I DO I WILL SAY I

00:43:51.061 --> 00:43:52.129
THINK WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT

00:43:52.196 --> 00:43:54.231
PROGRESS IN RECENT DAYS AND

00:43:54.298 --> 00:43:56.800
WEEKS -- AND AGAIN I I KNOW THAT

00:43:56.867 --> 00:43:57.835
THE AMOUNT OF WE WERE TALKING

00:43:57.901 --> 00:43:59.703
ABOUT IS IS I DON'T ASSIST

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:00.637
AMENDMENTS BUT IT'S A VERY

00:44:00.704 --> 00:44:01.872
SMALL FRACTION OF CALIFORNIA

00:44:01.939 --> 00:44:02.940
OIL PRODUCTION AND U. S. OIL

00:44:03.007 --> 00:44:04.308
PRODUCTION WE TALK ABOUT THREE

00:44:04.541 --> 00:44:06.677
PLATFORMS IT FAIRLY SHALLOW

00:44:06.744 --> 00:44:09.346
WATERS ANY AND ALL OFFSHORE

00:44:09.413 --> 00:44:10.681
PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA OFF THE

00:44:10.748 --> 00:44:11.849
COAST OF CALIFORNIA ACCOUNTS FOR

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:13.217
LESS THAN POINT THREE PERCENT

00:44:13.283 --> 00:44:15.386
OF U. S. OIL PRODUCTION -- SO

00:44:15.452 --> 00:44:16.320
I DON'T THINK WE'RE TALKING

00:44:16.387 --> 00:44:17.921
ABOUT WITH THESE THREE PLATFORMS

00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:19.823
ARE SHIFTING TO LIKE A MASSIVE

00:44:20.157 --> 00:44:21.658
CHANGE AND SUBSTITUTES OF

00:44:21.725 --> 00:44:23.093
PRODUCTS YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.528
TALKING ABOUT VERY SMALL DROP

00:44:24.595 --> 00:44:25.562
OF WITH THEIR SMALL DROP IN THE

00:44:25.629 --> 00:44:27.865
BUCKET BUT WE HAVE SEEN MISTER

00:44:27.931 --> 00:44:28.966
CHAIR WITH YOUR INDULGENCE

00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:31.168
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN IN THE -- --

00:44:31.235 --> 00:44:32.569
IN THE PLATFORM THAT SENATOR

00:44:32.636 --> 00:44:34.805
HERTZBERG A REFERENCE JUST

00:44:34.872 --> 00:44:36.940
HOW ONE CAN GO TO FIVE HUNDRED

00:44:37.007 --> 00:44:38.776
MILLION DOLLARS IN LIABILITY

00:44:38.842 --> 00:44:41.512
YEAH AND WE IN OUR DISCUSSION

00:44:41.578 --> 00:44:44.048
LAST WEEK ON THE BONDING VERSUS

00:44:44.114 --> 00:44:46.383
OTHER ALTERNATIVES WE'VE SEEN

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:48.752
WHAT THE LIABILITY TO THE STATE

00:44:48.819 --> 00:44:50.587
IS THAT IS REALLY BIG YEAH WITH

00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:52.056
THE EXISTING WELLS BEFORE WE

00:44:52.122 --> 00:44:54.058
EVEN MOVED TO SOMEWHERE ELSE

00:44:54.124 --> 00:44:56.393
SO THESE ARE REAL ISSUES THAT

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:57.728
ARE GOING TO HAVE IF I MIGHT

00:44:57.795 --> 00:44:59.163
REPLY JUST REAL QUICK PLEASE

00:44:59.229 --> 00:45:01.598
-- WE IN TALKING WITH PLANS AND

00:45:01.665 --> 00:45:02.666
YOU KNOW BUT YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE

00:45:02.733 --> 00:45:04.001
TO TAKE THESE THINGS THAT IT

00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:05.469
MAYBE WITH A GRAIN OF SALT BUT

00:45:05.702 --> 00:45:06.870
I DO BELIEVE THEY'VE LEARNED

00:45:06.937 --> 00:45:08.005
A LOT FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF

00:45:08.072 --> 00:45:09.807
THE COMMISSION HOLLY AND THEY

00:45:09.873 --> 00:45:10.908
THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE GOT

00:45:10.974 --> 00:45:12.409
A BETTER GRASP ON THE COST OF

00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:14.144
DECOMMISSIONING THE PROCESS AND

00:45:14.211 --> 00:45:15.579
WE ACTUALLY SAW SIMILAR ANALOG

00:45:15.646 --> 00:45:17.381
HERE WITH THE RESPONSE THAT WAS

00:45:17.448 --> 00:45:19.249
BILLS -- THAT THAT THAT WHAT

00:45:19.316 --> 00:45:20.984
WE SAW WITH OSCAR AND COMMAND

00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:22.286
CENTER IN HUNTINGTON BEACH OIL

00:45:22.352 --> 00:45:24.488
SPILL WAS WAS TRULY AMAZING I

00:45:24.555 --> 00:45:25.689
THAT COORDINATE A RESPONSE I

00:45:25.756 --> 00:45:26.990
THINK WAS THE RESULT OF LEARNED

00:45:27.057 --> 00:45:29.159
EXPERIENCE OF REALLY BUILDING

00:45:29.226 --> 00:45:30.427
ON THE LESSONS OF THE PAST AND

00:45:30.727 --> 00:45:32.162
LANCE COMMISSION IT SURE'S US

00:45:32.229 --> 00:45:33.397
THAT THEY HAVE LEARNED A LOT

00:45:33.464 --> 00:45:34.731
THEY HAVE A BETTER HANDLE ON

00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:36.400
HOW TO VALUE THIS AND ESTIMATED

00:45:36.467 --> 00:45:37.734
FOR EXAMPLE THAT PLATFORM ANY

00:45:37.801 --> 00:45:39.069
I BELIEVE IS IS GOING TO HAVE

00:45:39.136 --> 00:45:40.437
A DECOMMISSIONING COSTS ALL IN

00:45:40.504 --> 00:45:42.172
ABOUT NINETY TWO MILLION DOLLARS

00:45:42.439 --> 00:45:43.774
-- SO THAT GIVES US SOME SENSE

00:45:43.841 --> 00:45:44.741
OF THE BALLPARK FIGURES WERE

00:45:44.808 --> 00:45:46.176
TALKING ABOUT NOW I'M NOT SAYING

00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:47.277
THAT ALL THREE PLATFORMS OF THE

00:45:47.344 --> 00:45:49.012
SAME BUT THEY CAN'T REALLY START

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:50.280
THAT DECOMMISSIONING PROCESS ON

00:45:50.347 --> 00:45:51.548
ALL THREE PLATFORMS OR THE THE

00:45:51.615 --> 00:45:52.883
SETTLEMENT WITHOUT SOME KIND OF

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:54.151
AUTHORIZATION WHICH IS WHAT OUR

00:45:54.218 --> 00:45:56.386
BILL AIMS TO DO THANK YOU MISTER

00:45:56.453 --> 00:45:58.055
CHAIR I WOULD MOST OF THEM OKAY

00:45:58.122 --> 00:45:59.490
MOTION FOR CENTER LAYERED CENTER

00:45:59.556 --> 00:46:01.959
EGGMAN THANK YOU -- I THINK

00:46:02.025 --> 00:46:03.327
I'M ELEMENT SET UP WHO DOES NOT

00:46:03.393 --> 00:46:04.895
REPRESENT A COASTAL COMMUNITY

00:46:05.662 --> 00:46:06.964
SO THAT PUSHED ME TO A DIFFERENT

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:08.532
POSITIONS AND AND MORE DEPENDENT

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:09.433
UPON MY PEERS AND THEIR

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:11.301
EXPERIENCE AND SO I RESPECT

00:46:11.368 --> 00:46:13.570
EVERYBODY BUT PEOPLE OF SAID --

00:46:13.637 --> 00:46:15.105
THAT THIS INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED

00:46:15.172 --> 00:46:16.940
ISSUE WITH A HUGE LIABILITY

00:46:17.007 --> 00:46:19.576
POTENTIALLY TO THE TAXPAYERS --

00:46:19.643 --> 00:46:20.911
AND A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

00:46:20.978 --> 00:46:23.847
SHIFTING RISK FROM COASTLINES TO

00:46:23.914 --> 00:46:25.616
INTERCITY PORTS WHICH YOU KNOW

00:46:25.682 --> 00:46:27.618
WE KNOW WHO LIVES THERE AND THE

00:46:27.684 --> 00:46:30.220
-- THE PUT THE PRESSURE ON ON

00:46:30.287 --> 00:46:32.990
THOSE COMMUNITIES SO I I HAVE

00:46:33.056 --> 00:46:34.525
I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE COST

00:46:34.591 --> 00:46:36.727
I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE SHALL

00:46:36.793 --> 00:46:39.496
DETERMINATION -- AND I HAVE

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:42.132
CONCERNS THAT THERE ARE THAT

00:46:42.199 --> 00:46:44.234
THAT WE ARE WE ARE GIVING OVER

00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:46.203
-- A BIG PROBLEM TO SOLVE TO A

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:48.739
BUREAUCRACY AND MY EXPERIENCES

00:46:48.805 --> 00:46:49.740
BUREAUCRACIES DON'T SOLVE

00:46:49.806 --> 00:46:51.475
OUR PROBLEMS WE GOT TO FIGURE

00:46:51.542 --> 00:46:52.576
OUT THE STRUCTURE IN WHICH TO

00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:54.011
DO THAT THAT'S MORE FLEXIBLE

00:46:54.077 --> 00:46:56.180
AND PROVIDES FOR -- VARIATION

00:46:56.246 --> 00:46:57.181
BETWEEN THOSE THREE WELLS

00:46:57.247 --> 00:46:58.348
BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT JUST ONE

00:46:58.916 --> 00:47:00.083
ONE THING AND WE'RE WE'RE DOING

00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:02.452
ONE BILL FOR THREE WELLS SO

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:04.288
I WILK SUPPORTED TODAY I BUT

00:47:04.354 --> 00:47:05.589
I WILL NOT CONTINUE TO SUPPORT

00:47:05.656 --> 00:47:06.757
IT IF WE DON'T RESOLVE THE

00:47:06.823 --> 00:47:08.926
ISSUES THAT I THINK ARE VERY

00:47:08.992 --> 00:47:10.727
REAL IN FRONT OF US THANKS

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:12.796
FOR THE COMMENT -- WE DO HAVE

00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:14.131
A MOTION FROM CENTER LAYERED

00:47:14.198 --> 00:47:16.366
A CEREMONY OF A COMMENT QUITE

00:47:16.433 --> 00:47:17.434
WELL AND I'LL JUST COMMENT AND

00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:18.735
INPUT FROM HOLLY HAS COME UP

00:47:18.802 --> 00:47:20.204
MULTIPLE TIMES I THINK PEOPLE

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:21.205
KNOW THAT'S IN THE DISTRICT I

00:47:21.271 --> 00:47:23.073
REPRESENT -- AND SURELY THIS

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.374
IS AN ONGOING DISCUSSION AND I

00:47:24.441 --> 00:47:25.709
THINK WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE

00:47:25.776 --> 00:47:26.810
TO SEE THESE DISCUSSIONS

00:47:26.877 --> 00:47:28.312
COME UP IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE

00:47:28.545 --> 00:47:29.947
I I I DO THINK THAT THE

00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:31.448
CONSTITUENCIES WILL REPRESENT

00:47:31.715 --> 00:47:34.151
-- ARE VERY AWARE THAT THERE

00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:36.253
IS A SHIFT IN HOW WE THINK

00:47:36.587 --> 00:47:38.021
ABOUT YOU KNOW WHERE WE WOULD

00:47:38.088 --> 00:47:40.591
LIKE TO TAKE ON THE RISKS AND

00:47:40.657 --> 00:47:42.326
-- I YOU KNOW I CAN TELL YOU

00:47:42.392 --> 00:47:44.428
THAT AND THAT THIS BILL IS IN

00:47:44.494 --> 00:47:45.862
LINE WITH WHERE AT YOU KNOW

00:47:45.929 --> 00:47:47.497
CONSTITUENTS FEEL IN MY DISTRICT

00:47:47.731 --> 00:47:49.600
-- BUT IT'S NOT EASY AND SO I

00:47:49.666 --> 00:47:51.201
THINK LOOKING AT THE ANALYSIS

00:47:51.268 --> 00:47:52.569
WE YOU AND I HAD MULTIPLE

00:47:52.636 --> 00:47:54.705
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS AND

00:47:54.771 --> 00:47:56.940
ABOUT THIS ISSUE OVER ALL -- BUT

00:47:57.007 --> 00:47:58.875
IN MY FEELING IS IS THAT THIS

00:47:58.942 --> 00:48:00.010
IS A BILL THAT'S IN THE FIRST

00:48:00.077 --> 00:48:02.079
COMMITTEE IF YOU KNOW IF I HAD

00:48:02.145 --> 00:48:02.813
TO GUESS I THINK IT'S GONNA

00:48:02.879 --> 00:48:03.914
BE A WORK IN PROGRESS ALL THE

00:48:03.981 --> 00:48:05.315
WAY THROUGH BECAUSE THESE ARE

00:48:05.382 --> 00:48:07.284
VERY HARD ISSUES WE DON'T KNOW

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:09.186
WHERE WE LAND UNTIL THE END --

00:48:09.253 --> 00:48:10.721
AND IT'S REALLY THE FEEDBACK

00:48:10.787 --> 00:48:12.623
THE ANALYSIS AT THE BACK AND

00:48:12.689 --> 00:48:14.424
FORTH OF LEGISLATIVE INPUT AND

00:48:14.491 --> 00:48:16.193
INSIGHT AND OVERSIGHT AT THAT

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.028
KIND OF GETS PUT INTO THIS BILL

00:48:18.095 --> 00:48:20.297
THAT WILL HELP US -- WHERE IS

00:48:20.364 --> 00:48:21.965
THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION WAS

00:48:22.032 --> 00:48:24.434
-- A DECADE OR TWO AGO WITH

00:48:24.501 --> 00:48:25.669
WHERE THEY'RE AT NOW IN TERMS

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:26.737
OF THEIR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT

00:48:26.803 --> 00:48:28.472
THESE PLATFORMS -- AND THAT

00:48:28.538 --> 00:48:30.173
WITH THE WELLS OVERALL IT IS A

00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:31.141
THINK DIFFERENT THERE'S BEEN A

00:48:31.208 --> 00:48:32.976
LOT OF WORK A LOT OF EVOLVEMENT

00:48:33.243 --> 00:48:35.279
-- IN TERMS OF THE STAFF'S

00:48:35.345 --> 00:48:37.314

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:45.555

WHAT THAT MEANS RIGHT IT'S

00:48:47.758 --> 00:48:48.792
AN UNDERSTANDING OF TRYING TO

00:48:48.859 --> 00:48:50.460
TALK TO THE YOU KNOW PEOPLE

00:48:50.527 --> 00:48:52.396
OF CALIFORNIA OF WHAT THIS

00:48:53.530 --> 00:48:55.065
WHAT THE TRADE OFFS ARE AND

00:48:55.132 --> 00:48:57.200

LEGISLATIVE INSIGHT OVERSIGHT

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.587

ARE ON THE SAME SUBJECT AND

01:08:36.011 --> 01:08:38.280
I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS

01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:40.149
IF YOU STAND BACK FOR ME THE ONE

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:43.052
FOR ME AS AN INDIVIDUAL R.

01:08:43.519 --> 01:08:45.855
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US OUR WORK

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:47.256
ON THIS ISSUE AND FIGURE IT

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:49.825
OUT AND IT AND IT SEEMS THAT IF

01:08:50.626 --> 01:08:52.495
WE'RE FACILITATING ADDITIONAL

01:08:52.561 --> 01:08:54.964
OIL EXTRACTION AS PART OF THE

01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:57.533
PROCESS THAT IS IN SOME WAYS

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.435
DEFEATING OF OUR CLIMATE GOALS

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:01.804
AND ONE OF THE WITNESSES SAID A

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:04.507
REDUCE EMISSIONS IS A GOAL BUT

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:06.942
IF THERE WAS ONE A LETTER

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:08.410
OR NOT I WAS LOOKING FOR HERE

01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:10.012
THAT CAME IN THAT SAID WE NEED

01:09:10.079 --> 01:09:11.814
THIS TO EXTRACT MORE OIL WHAT

01:09:11.881 --> 01:09:14.216
THAT IS IS SORT OF UNCLEAR

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:15.985
ON THE CONCEPT IT IS SORT OF A

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:18.420
CLIMATE PROGRAM THAT LEADS TO

01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:20.856
MORE FOSSIL FUELS AND I THINK

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:24.426
YET -- WE DO NEED TO WORK

01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:27.329
ON CARBON CAPTURE WE DO NEED

01:09:27.396 --> 01:09:29.498
TO WORK ON IT IN SOME WAY

01:09:29.565 --> 01:09:31.901
BEING PART OF OUR A SUITE

01:09:31.967 --> 01:09:33.602
OF ALTERNATIVES BUT THE QUESTION

01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:35.170
IS IS THERE A WAY TO DO IT

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:37.506
THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THESE

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:39.608
OTHER ISSUES AND I THINK I

01:09:39.675 --> 01:09:42.011
MIGHT HAVE PROBLEMS OF MY OWN

01:09:42.077 --> 01:09:44.079
WITH EITHER THIRTEEN FOURTEEN

01:09:44.146 --> 01:09:46.282
OR ELEVEN OH ONE BUT WHAT'S

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:49.251
IMPORTANT I THINK HERE THAT I

01:09:49.318 --> 01:09:50.853
AM GOING TO VOTE TO MOVE BOTH

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.055
BILLS ALONG BECAUSE I KNOW THEIR

01:09:53.122 --> 01:09:55.624
CONVERSATIONS GOING ON TO TRY

01:09:55.691 --> 01:09:57.426
TO GET TO A UNIFIED POSITION

01:09:57.493 --> 01:09:59.461
THAT TAKES ACCOUNT INTO ACCOUNT

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:01.697
SOME OF THE CONCERNS I RAISED

01:10:02.131 --> 01:10:03.699
AND SO AT THE APPROPRIATE

01:10:03.766 --> 01:10:05.301
POINT I'M GOING TO MOVE THIS

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:07.169
BILL BECAUSE I THINK WE SHOULD

01:10:07.236 --> 01:10:08.837
ALLOW THOSE DISCUSSIONS TO GO

01:10:08.904 --> 01:10:11.407
AHEAD AND WE CAN SEE IF WE CAN

01:10:11.774 --> 01:10:13.609
FIND A PLACE THAT WE CAN MOVE

01:10:13.676 --> 01:10:15.311

01:12:53.235 --> 01:12:56.138
BE RUSHING TO PRIORITIZE

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:59.475
-- -- A TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION

01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:02.478
THAT THAT ESSENTIALLY SUBSIDIZES

01:13:02.544 --> 01:13:04.613
EXISTING OIL INDUSTRY ACTIVITY

01:13:05.013 --> 01:13:07.316
BUT I WILL SAY THAT I THINK

01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:08.383
THIS BILL IS NECESSARY BUT

01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:09.384
NOT SUFFICIENT I THINK WE'RE

01:13:09.451 --> 01:13:10.652
GONNA HAVE TO DO MORE I THINK

01:13:10.719 --> 01:13:12.387
WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT --

01:13:12.454 --> 01:13:14.123
AIR QUALITY PROTECTIONS I THINK

01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:15.157
YOU KNOW THERE'S A NUMBER OF

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:16.859
AMENDMENTS AND ISSUES WE'VE BEEN

01:13:16.925 --> 01:13:18.127
WORKING WITH CENTER CABALLERO

01:13:18.193 --> 01:13:20.629
AND HURT HER MEASURES WELL --

01:13:20.996 --> 01:13:22.464
BUT YOU KNOW I I DO THINK IT'S

01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:23.499
GOING TO BE A NECESSARY PIECE

01:13:23.565 --> 01:13:24.700
OF THE PUZZLE SO I APPRECIATE

01:13:24.767 --> 01:13:26.902
YOU BRINGING IT FORWARD -- AND

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:29.204
FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO TEST

01:13:29.271 --> 01:13:30.639
TO STEP OUT AND TRY TO COME TO

01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:32.541
SOME KIND OF SOLUTION HERE --

01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:33.742
TO HELP EVERYBODY MOVE FORWARD

01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:35.377
SO I'LL BE SUPPORT MEASURES

01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:37.146
WELL AND ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE

01:13:37.212 --> 01:13:38.080
UNLESS THERE'S ANY OTHER FURTHER

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:40.716
COMMENTS THANK YOU AN N.

01:13:40.783 --> 01:13:43.352
A. A. THINK M. AS IT'S BEEN SAID

01:13:43.719 --> 01:13:45.320
ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:46.655
ABOUT YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT

01:13:46.722 --> 01:13:49.491
CCS IS WHETHER CCS IS GOING

01:13:49.558 --> 01:13:51.493
TO BE A CLIMATE STRATEGY OR AN

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:54.196
OIL EXTRACTION STRATEGY AND

01:13:54.563 --> 01:13:55.697
I AM OF THE MIND THAT IT IS A

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:57.833
CLIMATE TRAGEDY AND I DO NOT

01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.234
BELIEVE IT AND I DO NOT WANT

01:13:59.301 --> 01:14:01.570
CCS TO BE THE NORTH NEW FORM OF

01:14:01.637 --> 01:14:03.972
FRACKING FOR CALIFORNIA AND AS

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:05.207
SUCH I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:06.475
DO THIS BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:07.876
REALLY IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:10.078
THIS BILL DOES NOT STOP CCS FROM

01:14:10.145 --> 01:14:12.681
HAPPENING CCS PROJECTS CANCEL

01:14:12.748 --> 01:14:14.383
HAPPENED THIS IS VERY SPECIFIC

TO ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY AT

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:19.021
BEING USED WITH CCS AND I THINK

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:21.190
THAT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT IT'S

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:23.091

LINE UNTIL FINAL FINISH LINE

01:14:33.735 --> 01:14:35.637

WORK FORCE AND OVERALL ECONOMY

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:33.815
THE USE OF C. C. U. S. WOULD

01:17:33.882 --> 01:17:36.018
ENABLE DIFFICULT TO DECARBONISE

01:17:36.084 --> 01:17:38.353

QUESTIONS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:39:03.237 --> 01:39:05.406

THAT WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT THAT

01:39:07.007 --> 01:39:09.476
ALL OTHER AMENDMENTS OTHER THAN

01:39:09.543 --> 01:39:11.245
THE AMENDMENT NUMBER THREE WHICH

01:39:11.312 --> 01:39:12.579
DEALS SPECIFICALLY WITH THIS

01:39:12.646 --> 01:39:15.049
EO OUR QUESTION -- THAT WE

01:39:15.115 --> 01:39:17.351
JUST OUT WITHIN THE LIMóN BILL

01:39:17.618 --> 01:39:19.086

BUT THAT -- BUT THAT OUTSTANDING

01:39:22.022 --> 01:39:24.591
ISSUE OF OF WHAT

01:39:24.658 --> 01:39:26.327
KINDS OF PROJECTS ARE ALLOWED

01:39:26.627 --> 01:39:28.195
-- AND HOW THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN

01:39:28.262 --> 01:39:29.463
ELEVEN NO ONE IN THIRTEEN

01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:31.765
FOURTEEN WOULD WORK -- IN TERMS

01:39:31.832 --> 01:39:33.834
OF ALLOWANCES OF OF ENHANCE YOUR

01:39:33.901 --> 01:39:35.135
RECOVERY OR OTHER FOSSIL FUEL

01:39:35.202 --> 01:39:36.870
PRODUCTION -- THAT WE ARE GOING

01:39:36.937 --> 01:39:38.939
TO TRY TO RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES

01:39:39.006 --> 01:39:41.742
NOT TODAY -- BUT GOING FORWARD

01:39:42.009 --> 01:39:43.610
-- AND I'D LIKE TO SEE THEM

01:39:43.677 --> 01:39:45.512
RESULT BEFORE THE FLOOR AND AND

01:39:45.579 --> 01:39:47.181
WOULD WOULD SAY THAT YOU KNOW

01:39:47.915 --> 01:39:49.817
I'M I'VE BEEN OFF OF ALL THE

01:39:49.883 --> 01:39:51.518
BILLS THAT ALLOW THAT KIND OF

01:39:52.319 --> 01:39:54.521
TECHNOLOGY TO BE UTILIZED --

01:39:54.588 --> 01:39:55.656
ON A NUMBER OF OTHER MEASURES

01:39:55.723 --> 01:39:56.623
BEFORE SO I DON'T WANT TO BE

01:39:56.690 --> 01:39:57.991
INCONSISTENT IN MY TREATMENT

01:39:58.058 --> 01:39:59.760
OF THESE BILLS BUT I WILL SAY

01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:02.096
-- BASED ON THE COMMITMENT

01:40:02.162 --> 01:40:04.398
OF THE AUTHOR AND HER VERY

01:40:04.998 --> 01:40:07.000
CREDIBLE AND HARD WORK ON THIS

01:40:07.368 --> 01:40:08.235
I'M AS WELL AS THE ON GOING

01:40:08.302 --> 01:40:09.470
CONVERSATIONS I THINK CENTER

01:40:09.536 --> 01:40:10.838
LATER REFERRED TO IN HIS REMARKS

01:40:10.904 --> 01:40:12.773
ON CEREMONIES LEGISLATION

01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:14.341
WILLING TO KEEP WORKING THROUGH

01:40:14.408 --> 01:40:16.543
AMENDMENTS THREE AND TRY TO

01:40:16.777 --> 01:40:18.912
TRY TO DETERMINE THE RIGHT

01:40:18.979 --> 01:40:21.281
WAY TO PUT LIMITS ON FOSSIL

01:40:21.348 --> 01:40:23.684
FUEL BASED PROJECTS HERE --

01:40:24.318 --> 01:40:25.686
IF WE CAN'T SOLVE THAT BEFORE

01:40:25.753 --> 01:40:27.087
THE FLOOR WILL NOT BE SUPPORTING

01:40:27.154 --> 01:40:29.256
THIS MEASURE BUT -- BUT FOR

01:40:29.323 --> 01:40:30.524
FOR PURPOSES OF DISCUSSION

01:40:30.591 --> 01:40:31.859
AND ONGOING CONVERSATION I

01:40:31.925 --> 01:40:33.894
THINK THAT WE CAN WE CAN DO

01:40:33.961 --> 01:40:34.895
SOME ADDITIONAL WORK THERE

01:40:34.962 --> 01:40:36.630
AND I WILL JUST SAY THAT --

01:40:37.431 --> 01:40:38.565
IN THE ENHANCE YOUR RECOVERY

01:40:38.632 --> 01:40:40.734
AND FOSSIL FUEL PRODUCTION SPACE

01:40:40.801 --> 01:40:43.303
-- THERE ARE THERE ARE CERTAIN

01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:44.838
LIMITS THAT I THINK ARE GOING

01:40:44.905 --> 01:40:45.839
TO BE IMPORTANT THE AIRPORTS

01:40:45.906 --> 01:40:46.874
ALREADY INDICATE IN THEIR

01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:48.475
TESTIMONY ON -- THE SCOPING

01:40:48.542 --> 01:40:50.144
PLAN LAST WEEK TERMS OF

01:40:50.210 --> 01:40:52.913
PRIORITIZATION -- I THINK HE

01:40:52.980 --> 01:40:54.782
Q. ADMIN PORTMAN'S ON THAT

01:40:54.848 --> 01:40:56.517
ON THAT PRIORITIZATION BUT I

01:40:56.583 --> 01:40:57.651
THINK THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

01:40:57.718 --> 01:40:59.319
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALREADY

01:40:59.386 --> 01:41:01.221
SIDE OF THESE SO MANY INDUSTRIES

01:41:01.288 --> 01:41:02.823
THAT ARE TOUGH TO DECARBONISE IS

01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:05.125
THE WE SUPPORT NOTED AND I THINK

01:41:05.192 --> 01:41:06.093
THAT'S THOSE ARE EXACTLY THE

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:07.327
RIGHT SECTORS TO BE FOCUSED ON

01:41:07.394 --> 01:41:08.562
YOUR DOING THE HARD STUFF HERE

01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:10.164
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT THE THE

01:41:10.230 --> 01:41:12.299
EASY LOW HANGING FRUIT THIS IS

01:41:12.366 --> 01:41:14.535
THESE ARE THE MOST HARDEST COULD

01:41:14.601 --> 01:41:16.737
BE THE MOST EXPENSIVE BUT VERY

01:41:16.804 --> 01:41:18.405
IMPORTANT ISSUES TO WRESTLE WITH

01:41:18.639 --> 01:41:21.074
-- WHETHER IT'S IN A BIOMASS

01:41:21.141 --> 01:41:23.110
APPLICATION WHETHER IT'S IN A

01:41:23.177 --> 01:41:25.379
HYDROGEN APPLICATION THERE ARE

01:41:25.446 --> 01:41:26.580
A NUMBER OF OTHER OTHER OTHER

01:41:26.647 --> 01:41:27.981
OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SECTOR THAT

01:41:28.048 --> 01:41:29.450
WE THINK GO BEYOND JUST SORT

01:41:29.516 --> 01:41:30.751
OF THIS NARROW FOCUS ON FOSSIL

01:41:30.818 --> 01:41:32.219
FUELS AND ENHANCED -- RECOVERY

01:41:32.286 --> 01:41:33.454
THAT I THINK ACTUALLY COULD

01:41:33.520 --> 01:41:34.822
HOLD SOME PROMISE TO BE A PROPER

01:41:34.888 --> 01:41:37.524
SAFEGUARDS BUT -- I JUST WANTED

01:41:37.958 --> 01:41:39.059
TO LAY THAT OUT FOR COMMITTEE

01:41:39.126 --> 01:41:41.228
MEMBERS OF THE UNDERSTAND --

01:41:41.628 --> 01:41:42.663
WHAT WERE THE CONVERSATIONS

01:41:42.729 --> 01:41:43.897
I'VE HAD WE'VE HAD BETWEEN THE

01:41:43.964 --> 01:41:45.299
AUTHOR IN THE COMMITTEE AND

01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:47.434
JUST GET A LITTLE -- AFFIRMATION

01:41:47.501 --> 01:41:49.369
FROM THE AUTHOR IF IF THAT

01:41:49.436 --> 01:41:52.272
SOUNDS LIKE A A WORKABLE

01:41:52.339 --> 01:41:54.541
PLAN GOING FOR YES IT DOES

01:41:54.608 --> 01:41:55.542
MISTER CHAIR AND I REALLY

01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:57.711
APPRECIATE THAT RECITATION OF

01:41:57.778 --> 01:41:59.947
THE DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD --

01:42:00.013 --> 01:42:02.616
IT I THINK I'VE TRIED

01:42:02.683 --> 01:42:03.984
TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR I'M NOT

01:42:05.018 --> 01:42:07.087
INTERESTED IN E. O. R.

01:42:07.387 --> 01:42:09.590
-- AS PART OF THAT --

01:42:10.791 --> 01:42:13.093
PART OF THAT THE DISK

01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:14.361
THE DISCUSSIONS BUT WHEN YOU'RE

01:42:14.428 --> 01:42:16.463
NEGOTIATING AND YOU'RE IT'S

01:42:16.530 --> 01:42:17.998
GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATING SOMEBODY

01:42:18.065 --> 01:42:19.032
HAS TO GIVE UP SOMETHING AND

01:42:19.099 --> 01:42:20.400
SOMEBODY HAS TO GET SOMETHING

01:42:20.467 --> 01:42:21.668
WE'RE NOT THERE YET WE'RE

GRINDSTONE -- AND IT IS

01:42:38.452 --> 01:42:40.487
MY ANTICIPATION AND --

01:42:40.554 --> 01:42:42.556
CENTERING THEM YOUR MOM CAN --

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:45.392

WANT THIS TO BE RESOLVED BY THE

01:42:47.561 --> 01:42:49.296
TIME WE GET TO THE FLOOR ONE WAY

01:42:49.363 --> 01:42:50.831
OR ANOTHER AND THAT WILL HAVE A

01:42:50.898 --> 01:42:52.132
PACKAGE THAT WILL HAVE A WHOLE

01:42:52.199 --> 01:42:54.501
BUNCH OF ELEMENTS IN IT THAT

01:42:54.568 --> 01:42:57.504
WILL -- REALLY

01:42:57.571 --> 01:42:59.940
PROVIDE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO

01:43:00.274 --> 01:43:02.476
A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT WE THINK

01:43:02.543 --> 01:43:04.211
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT BOTH IN

01:43:04.278 --> 01:43:07.214
TERMS OF -- AT PRODUCING

01:43:07.281 --> 01:43:08.649
ENERGY WHICH WHICH WHICH WE

DEFINITELY NEED TO DO WE NEED A

01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:12.152
GRADE THAT IS RELIABLE BUT MORE

01:43:12.219 --> 01:43:14.621
IMPORTANTLY IT STARTS TO --

01:43:15.455 --> 01:43:17.090
MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS BECAUSE

01:43:17.157 --> 01:43:19.426

POLLUTED AIR A LOT OF IT WHICH

01:43:31.872 --> 01:43:33.440

AND THE COMMITTEE AS WE --

01:43:48.021 --> 01:43:49.523
NARROW NARROW THE BILL'S DOWN

01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:51.091
TO REALLY FOCUS ON ON HOW

01:43:51.158 --> 01:43:53.126

01:43:56.897 --> 01:43:57.931
ONE AND WE'RE WORKING ON IT

01:43:57.998 --> 01:44:00.567
THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- EARLIER

01:44:02.002 --> 01:44:03.770
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND

I DID SAY WHAT I WANT A

01:44:05.973 --> 01:44:07.407
LOT OF WHAT I WANT TO SAY

01:44:07.474 --> 01:44:09.042
ON THE PREVIOUS BILL THE

01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:12.012
END DUE TO GO ON -- AND I

01:44:12.079 --> 01:44:13.680
APPRECIATE THE EXCHANGE WITH

01:44:13.747 --> 01:44:16.183
THE CHAIR AND AND THE AUTHOR

01:44:16.783 --> 01:44:19.419
-- I THOUGHT I WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE

01:44:19.486 --> 01:44:22.322
MR HANNAN'S COMMENTS -- --

01:44:22.389 --> 01:44:24.091
FOR -- FOR ONE REASON AND

01:44:24.157 --> 01:44:26.660
THAT IS IS THAT I APPRECIATED

01:44:26.727 --> 01:44:28.862
HIM TALKING ABOUT COMMITMENTS

01:44:28.929 --> 01:44:30.664
TO GOALS AND THE FACT THAT

01:44:30.731 --> 01:44:32.833
HE'S COMMITTED I APPRECIATED

01:44:32.899 --> 01:44:35.135
HIS MENTION OF OFFSHORE WIND

01:44:35.202 --> 01:44:36.570
BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS ANOTHER

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:39.773
PLACE THAT WE CAN FIND UNITY

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.174
I KNOW CENTER MCGUIRE AND I

01:44:41.241 --> 01:44:42.776
HAVE THE TWO LARGE PROPOSALS

01:44:42.843 --> 01:44:44.344
THAT ARE OFF OF OUR DISTRICTS

01:44:44.611 --> 01:44:46.380
AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO MOVING

01:44:46.446 --> 01:44:47.981
AHEAD AND WORKING OUT THAT

01:44:48.048 --> 01:44:50.417
FIREMEN WISHES AND THE PLANNING

01:44:50.484 --> 01:44:52.686
ISSUES AND AND TRYING TO DO

01:44:52.753 --> 01:44:54.721
IT EXPEDITIOUSLY AND THAT IS

01:44:54.788 --> 01:44:55.989
THE THEME THAT IS BEHIND THE

01:44:56.056 --> 01:44:57.758
DISCUSSION ON THIS BILL AND

01:44:57.824 --> 01:44:59.326
THE PREVIOUS ONE WHICH IS WE

01:44:59.393 --> 01:45:01.161
ARE TRYING TO WORK THINGS OUT

01:45:01.228 --> 01:45:03.964
SO WE CAN MOVE AHEAD AND

01:45:04.031 --> 01:45:06.233
WHILE I MIGHT OF EXPRESSES IT IN

01:45:06.299 --> 01:45:07.534
THE DISCUSSION OF THE PREVIOUS

01:45:07.601 --> 01:45:09.836
BILL SOME PROBLEMS I MIGHT HAVE

01:45:09.903 --> 01:45:11.571
PERSONALLY ON THIS ISSUE THAT

01:45:11.638 --> 01:45:13.073
WERE REFLECTED BY SOME OF THE

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:15.709
OPPOSITION COMMENTS IT IS MORE

01:45:15.776 --> 01:45:18.111
IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW THAT WE TRY

01:45:18.178 --> 01:45:19.913
TO MOVE AHEAD AND WORK THINGS

01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:21.381
OUT AND AND THAT IS WHAT'S

01:45:21.448 --> 01:45:23.917
GOING ON IN A VERY CONSTRUCTIVE

01:45:23.984 --> 01:45:26.486
MANNER AND I THINK THAT IT MAY

01:45:26.553 --> 01:45:28.922
BE BAFFLING TO SOME ADVOCATES

01:45:28.989 --> 01:45:30.457
ARE SOME PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES

01:45:30.524 --> 01:45:32.492
WHY WE WOULD MOVE OUT BOTH BILLS

01:45:32.726 --> 01:45:33.894
BUT I THINK WE'RE MOVING IT

01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:35.996
OUT IN THAT SPIRIT OF NOT BEING

01:45:36.063 --> 01:45:37.130
WHERE WE WERE AT THE END OF THE

01:45:37.197 --> 01:45:39.366
SESSION LAST YEAR BUT THE JUDGE

01:45:39.433 --> 01:45:41.468
TRIED TO FIGURE OUT CONSTRUCTIVE

01:45:41.535 --> 01:45:43.303
WAYS TO MOVE AHEAD BECAUSE THE

01:45:43.370 --> 01:45:45.105
CLOCK IS TICKING IN A RATHER

01:45:45.172 --> 01:45:48.075
HORRIFIC WAY ON CLIMATE AND WE

01:45:48.141 --> 01:45:50.310
CAN'T AFFORD TO JUST GO TO OUR

01:45:50.377 --> 01:45:52.946
CORNERS AND NOT TALK AND NOT

01:45:53.013 --> 01:45:54.681
WORKING OUT AND NOT FIND A

01:45:54.748 --> 01:45:56.316
COMMON GROUND I JUST WANT TO

01:45:56.383 --> 01:45:58.852
KNOWLEDGE IN THE TESTIMONY OF

01:45:59.086 --> 01:46:00.654
OF ONE OF THE KEY WITNESSES

01:46:00.721 --> 01:46:03.056
SO IN THAT SPIRIT TO CONTINUE

01:46:03.123 --> 01:46:04.191
ON WITH WHAT WE DID WITH THE

01:46:04.257 --> 01:46:06.159
PREVIOUS BILL I WILL MOVE THIS

01:46:06.226 --> 01:46:08.662
BILL SO THAT'S

01:46:08.729 --> 01:46:10.931
A MOTION FROM CENTER LAYERED

01:46:10.997 --> 01:46:13.500
AND -- COMING FROM CEREMONY

01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:15.102
THANK YOU AND THANK YOU SENATOR

01:46:15.168 --> 01:46:16.837

01:46:17.137 --> 01:46:18.171
YOU KNOW VERY PUBLIC ABOUT HOW

01:46:18.238 --> 01:46:19.673
MUCH WE'VE WORKED ON THIS ISSUE

01:46:20.006 --> 01:46:22.375
AND YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT AT

01:46:22.442 --> 01:46:24.444
THIS IS A ONE OF THOSE ISSUES

01:46:24.511 --> 01:46:27.180
WERE YOU KNOW SOME STAKEHOLDERS

01:46:27.247 --> 01:46:28.749
HAVE EXPRESSED A LOT OF CONCERN

01:46:29.082 --> 01:46:30.784
-- AND YOU KNOW I WILL BE

01:46:30.851 --> 01:46:31.885
SUPPORTING YOUR BILL IN THE

01:46:31.952 --> 01:46:33.754
SPIRIT OF ONGOING CONVERSATIONS

01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:34.855
AND THE FACT THAT WE NEED TO

01:46:34.921 --> 01:46:36.523
FIGURE OUT WHERE WE LAND -- AND

01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:37.791
THAT IS NOT AND I WANT TO BE

01:46:37.858 --> 01:46:39.326
VERY CLEAR FOR THE RECORD IN

01:46:39.392 --> 01:46:42.395
ANY WAY TO DISMISS -- OVERRIDE

01:46:42.462 --> 01:46:44.731

01:46:44.798 --> 01:46:46.032
THAT HAVE EXPRESSED CONCERNS

01:46:46.099 --> 01:46:47.634
I THINK THAT THOSE CONCERNS

01:46:47.968 --> 01:46:49.803
-- THAT HAVE BEEN HEARD AND I

01:46:49.870 --> 01:46:51.304
THINK THEY'RE SHARED BY MULTIPLE

01:46:51.371 --> 01:46:53.206
FOLKS I MEAN INCLUDING YOURSELF

01:46:53.473 --> 01:46:55.342
AND I I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:46:55.408 --> 01:46:56.977
TO RECOGNIZE THAT IN ORDER TO

01:46:57.043 --> 01:46:58.612
TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS A

01:46:58.678 --> 01:47:00.447
CONVERSATION NEEDS TO CONTINUE

01:47:00.714 --> 01:47:01.948
ON THIS TOPIC AND SO I THINK

01:47:02.015 --> 01:47:03.483
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND I

THIS BILL DOES NOT GO TO AND

01:49:08.141 --> 01:49:08.975

01:49:11.244 --> 01:49:13.546

-- I THINK THE CENTRAL ISSUE

02:00:53.379 --> 02:00:55.314
FOR ME IS IS THAT THE PURPOSE

02:00:55.381 --> 02:00:57.316
OF THIS BILL IS AN INCREDIBLY

02:00:57.383 --> 02:01:00.019
LAUDABLE IT PARTICULARLY

02:01:00.653 --> 02:01:03.522

02:01:04.090 --> 02:01:06.993
POSITION OUR ILLEGAL

02:01:07.059 --> 02:01:09.428
CANNABIS GROWS DIVERTED OUR

02:01:09.495 --> 02:01:11.731
WATER USE PESTICIDES THAT

02:01:11.797 --> 02:01:13.466
WERE REALLY DIFFICULT TO BAN

02:01:14.033 --> 02:01:15.134
FREQUENTLY THERE WERE GUNS

02:01:15.201 --> 02:01:16.402
INVOLVED THROUGH ALL THESE

02:01:16.469 --> 02:01:18.237
THINGS THAT WERE NOT GOOD AND

02:01:18.304 --> 02:01:19.805
I THINK THIS BILL RECOGNIZES

02:01:19.872 --> 02:01:21.440
THAT TRIES TO GET IT THAT

02:01:22.775 --> 02:01:24.377
HOWEVER IT REFERS TO THE THEFT

02:01:24.443 --> 02:01:25.945
OF GROUNDWATER I DON'T THINK THE

02:01:26.012 --> 02:01:27.446
THEFT OF GROUNDWATER SOMETHING

02:01:27.513 --> 02:01:29.248
THAT EXISTS IN THE CODE IT'S

02:01:29.315 --> 02:01:31.417
SO THE THE QUESTION IS IS HOW

02:01:32.051 --> 02:01:34.720
COULD WE TAKE THE GOALS THAT IS

02:01:34.787 --> 02:01:36.589
SET OUT HERE AND BETTER ALIGN

02:01:36.656 --> 02:01:38.524
IT TO THE ACTION THAT IS IN THE

02:01:38.591 --> 02:01:41.160
BILL IN HAND BECAUSE I

02:01:41.961 --> 02:01:43.195
WHOLLY AGREE WITH WHAT THE

02:01:43.262 --> 02:01:45.965
AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO HERE AND

02:01:46.032 --> 02:01:47.767
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A THING

02:01:47.833 --> 02:01:50.603
ABOUT MOVING TO A NEW LEGAL

02:01:51.070 --> 02:01:53.139
MARK DRILLING OF WELLS OR

02:01:53.205 --> 02:01:54.807
SOMETHING THAT IS MORE ALIGNED

02:01:54.874 --> 02:01:56.075
WITH WHAT THE REALITY OF THE

02:01:56.142 --> 02:01:57.977
LAW FOR THE SITUATION IS ON THE

02:01:58.044 --> 02:02:00.212
GROUND AND AND SO IF IF THE

02:02:00.279 --> 02:02:02.848
AUTHOR IS IS WILLING TO WORK ON

02:02:02.915 --> 02:02:04.450
THOSE ISSUES AND TRY TO ALIGN

02:02:04.517 --> 02:02:06.318
THE BILL BETTER TO WHAT THE

02:02:06.385 --> 02:02:08.387
PRACTICALITIES AND THE CODE ON

02:02:08.454 --> 02:02:09.955
ONE TO GIVE HER THE CHANCE TO

02:02:10.022 --> 02:02:12.224
WORK ON IT BUT IT -- THAT WAS

02:02:12.291 --> 02:02:14.560
JUST MY CONCERN I LOVE THE WHOLE

02:02:29.375 --> 02:02:31.310
A SUGGESTED AMENDMENT WHICH

02:02:31.377 --> 02:02:32.845
I WILL TAKE WITH IT WHICH

02:02:33.646 --> 02:02:36.415

OF US DON'T WANT THEM TO DO

02:03:04.410 --> 02:03:06.912
RIGHT WELL I THE THE GROSSES

02:03:06.979 --> 02:03:09.448
AS I UNDERSTAND -- BASICALLY

02:03:09.515 --> 02:03:12.051
JUST -- DIVERT WATER FROM FROM

02:03:12.118 --> 02:03:14.787
RIVERS AND STREAMS -- AND THEY

02:03:14.987 --> 02:03:17.690
TAP INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S SYSTEM

02:03:17.890 --> 02:03:20.459
IN IT AND -- AND THEY DO THAT

02:03:20.526 --> 02:03:23.062
BY PUTTING IN HOSES AND DRIP

02:03:23.129 --> 02:03:24.363
AND WHATEVER THEY NEED IN

02:03:24.430 --> 02:03:25.331
ORDER TO BE ABLE TO CONVEY

02:03:25.397 --> 02:03:27.032
THE WATER OVER TO TO WHERE

02:03:27.099 --> 02:03:28.534
THEY'RE GROWING AND SO THAT'S

02:03:28.601 --> 02:03:30.402
WHY THEY'RE ACTUALLY TWO ONE IS

02:03:30.469 --> 02:03:31.871
DIGGING ARE EXTRACTING GROUND

02:03:32.104 --> 02:03:33.472
WATER FROM IT AND PERMITTED

02:03:33.539 --> 02:03:35.407
WHILE I'M IN THE OTHER ONE

02:03:35.474 --> 02:03:37.009
WHICH IS AN AUTHORIZED TAPPING

02:03:37.076 --> 02:03:38.144
INTO OUR WATER CONVEYANCE OR

02:03:38.210 --> 02:03:40.045
STORAGE INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH

02:03:40.112 --> 02:03:41.313
WHICH IS AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:42.648
ALREADY EXISTS BUT IT'S NOT

02:03:42.715 --> 02:03:45.251
THERE FOR THEM -- NOW IF THERE'S

02:03:45.551 --> 02:03:46.786
MORE WORD SMITHING WE NEED TO

02:03:46.852 --> 02:03:48.587
DO WE SHOULD DO IT BUT I LIKED

02:03:48.654 --> 02:03:50.790
THE THEFT AND SO -- AND I WAS

02:03:50.856 --> 02:03:52.057
RIGHTLY CORRECTED THAT THAT'S

02:03:52.124 --> 02:03:53.459
PROBABLY NOT THE MOST PRO ONCE

02:03:53.526 --> 02:03:54.860
AGAIN RIGHT NOT SUPPOSED TO

02:03:54.927 --> 02:03:56.128

MAY BE IN OR OUT -- AND WHAT

02:19:04.469 --> 02:19:06.871
THE PROCESS WOULD BE -- BUT

02:19:07.405 --> 02:19:09.140
I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT WE

02:19:09.207 --> 02:19:09.941

-- ARE INCREASINGLY VIEWED AS A

02:19:49.681 --> 02:19:50.982

AMONG THOSE THOUSANDS OF ACRES

02:19:57.689 --> 02:19:58.990
THERE'S CERTAIN ACRES THAT

02:19:59.057 --> 02:20:00.558
MATTER MORE THAN OTHERS AND

02:20:00.625 --> 02:20:01.860
THE PROBLEM WITH CURRENT LAWS

02:20:01.926 --> 02:20:04.262
THAT THE COUNTY IS RESPONSIBLE

02:20:04.329 --> 02:20:05.964
AND STATES AND CITIES AND

02:20:06.030 --> 02:20:07.866

02:20:09.968 --> 02:20:11.703
OF AN OAK WOODLAND OR THE THE

02:20:11.770 --> 02:20:13.271
DESTRUCTION OF -- OAK WOODLAND

02:20:13.838 --> 02:20:15.440
OFTEN RESULT IN ADOPTING A

02:20:15.507 --> 02:20:17.142
ONE TO ONE OAK TREE MITIGATION

02:20:17.208 --> 02:20:19.778
POLICY THAT DOES NOT ADEQUATELY

02:20:19.844 --> 02:20:21.212
ACCOUNT FOR THEIR VALUE WHETHER

02:20:21.279 --> 02:20:23.214
YOU'RE REPLACING A HUNDRED YEAR

02:20:23.281 --> 02:20:25.617
OAK WITH A A SAPLING OR WHETHER

02:20:25.683 --> 02:20:26.985
YOU'RE FAILING TO RECOGNIZE

02:20:27.051 --> 02:20:29.254
THAT CERTAIN STANDS OF OAK

02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:30.889
WOODLANDS -- WHILE THEY MAY

02:20:30.955 --> 02:20:32.824
BE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY OR IN

02:20:33.758 --> 02:20:35.827
A SORT OF MORE URBAN FACING

02:20:36.127 --> 02:20:37.662
-- AREA IF THEY'RE CONNECTED

02:20:37.729 --> 02:20:38.763
TO THAT WILD LAND THEY ARE

02:20:38.830 --> 02:20:40.498
STILL PART OF THAT HABITAT AND

02:20:40.765 --> 02:20:41.866
THEREFORE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

02:20:41.933 --> 02:20:43.301
EFFECT ON THE ENVIRONMENT SO

02:20:43.601 --> 02:20:44.836
THAT'S THE THE INTENT OF THIS

02:20:44.903 --> 02:20:47.138
BILL IS TO GET TO ALL THOSE OAK

02:20:47.205 --> 02:20:49.240
WOODLANDS -- THAT ARE CURRENTLY

02:20:49.307 --> 02:20:50.675
NOT BEING ADEQUATELY MITIGATED

02:20:50.742 --> 02:20:52.977
FOR AND HOPEFULLY FIND SOME WAY

02:20:53.878 --> 02:20:55.914
TO MEET THE GOALS OF OF OUR

BUILD OUT -- WITHOUT DECIMATING

02:20:59.984 --> 02:21:01.119
OUR ECOSYSTEMS I THINK

02:21:01.186 --> 02:21:02.720
WE CAN DO BOTH ESPECIALLY

02:21:02.787 --> 02:21:04.455
WITH THE INCREASED FOCUS ON

02:21:04.522 --> 02:21:07.325

02:21:07.392 --> 02:21:09.627
AND AND -- URBAN DEVELOPMENT

02:21:09.694 --> 02:21:11.196
I THINK THAT WE CAN WE CAN

02:21:11.262 --> 02:21:12.664
FIND A WAY TO TO NOT DESTROY

02:21:12.730 --> 02:21:14.265
THAT URBAN WILDLAND URBAN

02:21:14.332 --> 02:21:17.001
INTERFACE BUT STILL -- BUT

STILL MEET OUR HOUSING AND OTHER

02:21:18.970 --> 02:21:21.072
INFRASTRUCTURE GOALS LEAD AGENCY

02:21:21.139 --> 02:21:23.007

02:21:26.110 --> 02:21:27.478
NONE OF THOSE MITIGATION ISSUES

02:21:27.545 --> 02:21:28.580
CEASE AND THIS WOULDN'T BE AN

02:21:28.646 --> 02:21:29.814
ALL OUT BAR AND ANY OF THAT

02:21:29.881 --> 02:21:31.549
DEVELOPMENT IT JUST REQUIRES

02:21:31.616 --> 02:21:33.251
MORE RIGOROUS MITIGATION IN

02:21:33.318 --> 02:21:35.887
CERTAIN SENSITIVE AREAS -- SO

LOCALLY THEY ARE THERE TO LOOK

02:29:15.980 --> 02:29:17.348
AT PROJECTS AND FIGURE OUT HOW

02:29:17.415 --> 02:29:18.816
TO MAKE IT WORK IN THE LOCATION

02:29:18.883 --> 02:29:20.351
WHERE IT'S PROPOSED WE JUST

02:29:20.418 --> 02:29:21.419
DON'T THINK WE CAN BE DOING AT

02:29:21.485 --> 02:29:22.853
THE STATE LEVEL THANK YOU AND

02:29:22.920 --> 02:29:24.355
LET YOU GO ON BECAUSE WE HAD

NO LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS AND

I SUSPECT THE SECOND ONE COULD

02:29:27.825 --> 02:29:29.460
BE AS WELL AND THEN WE'LL GO TO

02:29:29.527 --> 02:29:31.729

THIRTY NINE RURAL COUNTIES IN

THE STATE WE OPPOSE SB FORTINO

02:29:40.237 --> 02:29:42.273
FOR TODAY WE DON'T DISPUTE THE

02:29:42.340 --> 02:29:44.141
THE ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS OF OAKS

OR OAK WOODLANDS IN THE STATE

02:29:45.843 --> 02:29:46.877
BUT WE THINK THIS IS THE WRONG

02:29:46.944 --> 02:29:48.713
APPROACH FIRST ESTABLISHES

02:29:48.779 --> 02:29:50.181
AN ARBITRARY ONE SIZE FITS

02:29:50.247 --> 02:29:51.615
ALL STANDARD FOR DETERMINING

02:29:51.682 --> 02:29:53.217
THE THRESHOLD OF SIGNIFICANCE

02:29:53.484 --> 02:29:55.252
ACROSS THE STATE REGARDLESS

02:29:55.319 --> 02:29:57.054
OF THE BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY

02:29:57.321 --> 02:29:58.823
AND REGIONAL DIVERSITY IN THE

02:29:58.889 --> 02:30:00.257
STATE AND SECOND BECAUSE IT

02:30:00.324 --> 02:30:01.726
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES EQUAL

02:30:01.792 --> 02:30:03.928
EDUCATION BY ELIMINATING A

02:30:03.994 --> 02:30:05.196
SAFE HARBOR THAT EXIST IN

02:30:05.262 --> 02:30:07.164
EXISTING LAW FOR PROJECTS

02:30:07.231 --> 02:30:08.833
THAT HAVE INCLUDED MITIGATION

02:30:08.899 --> 02:30:10.034
MEASURES IDENTIFIED BY THE

02:30:10.101 --> 02:30:12.269
LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE DON'T

02:30:12.336 --> 02:30:14.004
THINK ARE AT SIGNIFICANT RISK

02:30:14.071 --> 02:30:15.973
OF DEVELOPMENT OR CONVERSION

02:30:16.040 --> 02:30:17.208
AND MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES

02:30:17.408 --> 02:30:18.809
FOR OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION

02:30:18.876 --> 02:30:20.644
FOLKS IN THE STATE AND YET THIS

02:30:20.711 --> 02:30:22.446
BILL ESTABLISHES A THRESHOLD OF

02:30:22.513 --> 02:30:24.081
THREE OAK TREES REGARDLESS OF

02:30:24.148 --> 02:30:25.750
THE SIZE OF THE PROJECT TENTH

02:30:25.816 --> 02:30:27.318
OF AN ACRE THOUSAND ACRES A

02:30:27.385 --> 02:30:29.754
HUNDRED ACRES SO IF THE AUTHOR

02:30:29.820 --> 02:30:31.188
WANTS TO TAKE A HARDER LOOK AT

02:30:31.255 --> 02:30:32.256
WHAT SOME OF THOSE MITIGATION

02:30:32.323 --> 02:30:33.858
MEASURES ARE AND HOW ADEQUATE

02:30:33.924 --> 02:30:35.025
THEY ARE UNDER THE EXISTING

02:30:35.092 --> 02:30:37.194
CONSTRUCT WE'RE HAPPY TO DO THAT

02:30:37.261 --> 02:30:38.662
WERE LOOK AT AND SEE IF THOSE

02:30:38.729 --> 02:30:39.997
EXISTING MITIGATION MEASURES

02:30:40.064 --> 02:30:41.265
ARE WELL SUITED FOR SOME OF

02:30:41.332 --> 02:30:42.700
THOSE TREES PIECES IDENTIFIED

02:30:42.767 --> 02:30:44.368
THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT HAVE

02:30:44.435 --> 02:30:45.870
REPRODUCTION ISSUES HAPPEN TO

02:30:45.936 --> 02:30:47.838
HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT

02:30:47.905 --> 02:30:49.607
ESTABLISHING THE THRESHOLD AND

02:30:49.673 --> 02:30:51.575
THEN ELIMINATING THE SAFE HARBOR

02:30:51.642 --> 02:30:53.210
WE THINK IS A MISGUIDED APPROACH

02:30:53.444 --> 02:30:55.646
WILL INCREASE THE THE COSTS

02:30:55.713 --> 02:30:57.882
THE TIME FRAMES AND LITIGATION

02:30:57.948 --> 02:30:59.250

SORT OF WHAT MAY LOOK LIKE

02:35:10.834 --> 02:35:13.370
A DE MINIMUS IMPACT BUT --

02:35:14.471 --> 02:35:15.939
CUMULATIVELY IN A WAY THAT THE

02:35:16.006 --> 02:35:17.741
CURRENT LAW DOESN'T RECOGNIZE

02:35:18.142 --> 02:35:19.643
-- WILL BE SIGNIFICANT IN THEIR

02:35:19.710 --> 02:35:21.612

COMMENT THAT I MADE ON SENATOR

02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:44.401

02:35:44.468 --> 02:35:46.036
ANALYSIS REFERS TO THIS IS A

02:35:46.103 --> 02:35:48.038
WORK IN PROGRESS AND I WAS GOING

02:35:48.105 --> 02:35:50.107

I WANTED THAT TIME TO BE TODAY

02:36:00.818 --> 02:36:03.020

OF THE KINDS OF AREAS THAT ARE

02:36:15.232 --> 02:36:17.735
BEING MAPPED THE THE CATCH

02:36:17.801 --> 02:36:19.970
ALL RIGHT NOW IS WHEN THERE'S

02:36:28.912 --> 02:36:30.214
THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN IS

02:36:30.514 --> 02:36:33.183
-- WE'RE LOOKING AT CDFW MAPS

02:36:33.250 --> 02:36:35.986

JURISDICTION TO ADOPT ANYTHING

02:36:50.234 --> 02:36:51.168
THERE IS A CERTAIN THERE IS

02:36:51.235 --> 02:36:52.236
CURRENTLY AN OAK WOODLANDS

02:36:52.302 --> 02:36:54.304
CONSERVATION ACT THAT ALLOWS

LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO ADOPT

02:36:56.039 --> 02:36:58.242
SOME OF THESE -- THESE SORT

02:36:58.308 --> 02:37:00.878
OF BROADER OAK WOODLAND

02:37:00.944 --> 02:37:03.580
SAVANNA PROTECTIONS -- SO THAT

02:37:03.647 --> 02:37:05.015

CONSERVANCY IS ADOPTED AND

02:37:11.789 --> 02:37:13.490
WHETHER THERE'S ANY ANALOG SO WE

02:37:13.557 --> 02:37:15.526

02:37:15.592 --> 02:37:17.795
HABITAT LINKAGE MAP PER SE WANT

02:37:17.861 --> 02:37:19.096

AND A FEW OTHER JURISDICTIONS

02:37:20.364 --> 02:37:21.265
BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST

02:37:21.331 --> 02:37:23.200
LIMIT THE APPLICATION ONLY TO

02:37:27.104 --> 02:37:29.139
BUT THAT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY

02:37:29.206 --> 02:37:31.708
GOOD START FOR A FOUNDATION --

02:37:31.775 --> 02:37:33.844
