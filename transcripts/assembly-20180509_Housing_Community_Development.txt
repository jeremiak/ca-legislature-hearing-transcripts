GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO THE WEDNESDAY MAY THE NINTH TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN MEETING OF THE ASSEMBLY HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE I THINK AT THIS POINT. WE DO NOT YET HAVE A QUORUM BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF ONE WE WILL BEGIN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE WE HAVE A QUORUM WE WILL TAKE MEASURES UP FOR VOTES AND CALL ROLE. WITH THAT WE HAVE OUR FIRST AUTHOR HERE. MR MATHIS. FILE ITEM FIVE A. B. NINETEEN FIFTEEN. MR MATHIS WELCOME. WE. DURING THE DAY. THE BILL. BILL THAT WOULD ACT OR. WROTE. AS FOR ALL WHERE LAUGHTER VIDAK DID SENATE BILL TWO. THE BUILDING HOMES AND JOBS ACT. THIS MEASURE CREATED A SEVENTY FIVE DOLLAR FEE ON EVERY REAL ESTATE DOCUMENTS FOR EACH SINGLE TRANSACTION. PER SINGLE PARCEL OF REAL PROPERTY NOT TO EXCEED. TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. FURTHERMORE. THE MEASURE ESTABLISHED A DEFINITION OF REAL ESTATE. INSTRUMENT PAPER OR NOTICE HOWEVER THE VAGUE SCOPE OF THIS DEFINITION HAS CAUSED NUMEROUS AGENCIES TO QUESTION WHICH DOCUMENTS. ONES THAT ARE NOT EXPLICITLY LISTED WITHIN THE ACT ARE SUBJECT TO THIS FEE INCREASE. SINCE SB TWO WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BOTH FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES. HAVE QUESTION THE LEGALITY OF COLLECTION. THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CHILD SUPPORT SERVICES TO STATED THAT THEY DO NOT BELIEVE THE TACK SHOULD APPLY TO CHILD SUPPORT DOCUMENTS. COUNTY RECORDS. RECORDERS. HAVE OPENED THAT DAY TAX DOES APPLY TO THESE DOCUMENTS ASPER SH CORRECT READING OF THE NEW LAW. UNTIL A COURT RULING ON THE MATTER IS FINALIZED MANY AGENCIES HAVE BEEN LEFT TO QUESTION THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO COLLECT THESE FEES AND THE INTERNAL. ONE SUCH TRADE BEFORE MISTER CHILD LEAVES I WANT TO SEE IF WE CAN ESTABLISH A QUORUM. SORRY ABOUT THAT MADAM SECRETARY COULD PLEASE CALL THE ROLL IS JUST WAITING FOR YOU TO FINISH BUT I WANT TO DO IT BEFORE HE LEAVES. CHIU A HERE HERE MAIENSCHEIN MENTIONED HERE CHAU. CHAU YEAR CHOI HERE CHOI HERE GLORIA LAMONT WHICH THANK YOU WE HAVE A QUORUM THANK YOU MISTER CAL. TAKE YOUR BACK TO MR MATHIS. THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMERCIAL BREAK. NOW THAT THE IN TERMS OVER. ONE SUCH TRADE WHICH WILL BE SEVERELY IMPACTED BY THIS NEW FEE. CALIFORNIA'S PROSPEROUS MINING INDUSTRY. MONEY AND RECORDS ARE THE ONLY TYPE OF DOCUMENT THAT HAS TO BE FILED EVERY SINGLE YEAR. OR THE OWNER COULD LOSE THEIR CLAIM INDEFINITELY. DUE TO THE NATURE OF MINERAL EXPLORATION AND EXTRACTION. IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR A SINGLE PROJECT TO RESULT MULTIPLE MY NAME DOCUMENTS THAT NEED TO BE RECORDED. FOR EXAMPLE LAST YEAR INYO COUNTY A SINGLE CLAIM IT RECORDED MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND MINING CLAIM LOCATION NOTICES FOR A SINGLE PROJECT. THE TOTAL COST. TO RECORD THESE DOCUMENTS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN. WAS FOURTEEN. THOUSAND DOLLARS AS OF JANUARY ONE TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE COSTS INCREASED TO EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS. TODAY MOST MINDS OR. OPERATED BY SMALL PROSPECTORS ATTEMPTED TO SEEK OUT A LIVING. IN ORDER TO KEEP THEIR CLAIM THE MINOR MUST EITHER PAY AN ANNUAL FEE TO THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT OR PROVE THAT THEY ARE ACTIVELY EXPLORING FOR MINERALS. IF THE IS UNABLE TO PAY. THE NEW TAX TO RECORD THEIR DOCUMENTS THEY WILL LOSE THEIR CLAIM. CALIFORNIA'S NON FUEL MINERAL. PRODUCTION IS VALUED AT MORE THAN. THREE POINT SEVEN SIX BILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR. IN FACT CALIFORNIA IS THE ONLY STATE TO PRODUCE BORON WHICH IS USED IN EVERYTHING FROM ROCKET FUEL TO EYEDROPS TO AND ACCEPT. IT IS ALSO HOME. TO THE ONLY RARE EARTH MINE IN THE NATION. THERE IS ALSO PROMISE OF NEW GREEN ENERGY MINERAL PRODUCTION. WHICH IS IN THE EARLY STAGE OF EXPLORATION. AND I'M TALKING ABOUT LITHIUM HERE FOLKS. HOWEVER THESE FOR. THESE PRODUCTIONS. ARE IN JEOPARDY OF BEING LOST. DO TO THE FEE ESTABLISHED BY THE BUILDING HOMES AND JOBS ACTS. AND ANY MONEY OPERATION TO CONTINUE DESPITE THE FEE ARE LIKELY TO SHIFT COST. FOR THESE MINERALS DOWN TO THE CONSUMERS. AS YOU ARE ALL AWARE LITHIUM IS A KEY ASPECT IN MEDIAN AREN'T FIRE MENTAL GOALS. LITHIUM AND ITS COMPOUNDS HAVE SEVERAL INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS INCLUDING HEAT RESISTANT GLASS AND CERAMICS. WITH THE INCREASED LIVER CANCER LITHIUM BATTERIES AND LITHIUM ION BATTERIES. THEY'RE ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR TYPES OF RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES FOR PORTABLE ELECTRONICS. AND ARE ALSO GROWING IN POPULARITY FOR MILITARY BATTER. ELECTRICAL VEHICLES WERE E. VIS. AND AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS. AS OUR STATE BOLSTERS IN DEVELOPMENT. AND THEY USE OF ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WE MUST ACTIVELY SEEK MEANS TO REDUCE COSTS. FOR THE AVERAGE CONSUMER. UNFORTUNATELY THE OVERSIGHT OF LUMPING MINING CLAIM DOCUMENTS INTO SENATE BILL TWO. WELL UNFORTUNATELY HUNDRED THIS PROGRESS. AS THE COST TO EXTRACT THIS VITAL RESOURCE SO TOO WILL THE PRICE INCREASE FOR THINGS SUCH AS CELL PHONES AND SOLAR PANELS. ALL OF THIS TECH WILL SEE PRICE INCREASES. SPECIALLY IN THE GREEN TECH MARKET. IN FACT THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION IS SCHEDULED TO CONSIDER A PROPOSAL THIS MORNING. AT TEN AM SO HERE ABOUT THIRTY MINUTES. THAT WILL MANDATE MOST NEW HOMES TO HAVE SOLAR PANELS STARTING IN TWENTY TWENTY. MOST SOLAR PANELS USE UTILIZE LITHIUM AS THEIR PRIMARY BATTERY SOURCE. WITHOUT THE RELIEF OFFERED IN THIS MEASURE. WE CAN CERTAINLY EXPECT THE COST OF LIVING IN TO INCREASE THEREBY INCREASING THE PRICE OF SOLAR PANELS. THESE COSTS DIRECTLY IN KEY GREASE THE COST OF HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. AS WE DISCUSS AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS WE MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT. THAT INACTION ON THIS PROPOSAL WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO INCREASES AND HOUSING COSTS. ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN FIFTEEN PROVIDES A SMALL EXEMPTION TO THE PEER REVIEW OF. THE BUILDING AND HOMES AND JOBS AT. BY EXPLICITLY EXCLUDING MINING CLAIMS THE LEGISLATURE CAN PRESERVE THIS PROSPEROUS INDUSTRY WHILE ALSO ENSURE EARNING THE DEVELOPMENT. OF GREEN ENERGY MATERIALS FOR OUR GREEN TACK KHANOM. WE CANNOT HAMPER THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS KEY TECHNOLOGY AS WE MOVE TOWARDS OUR CLIMATE GOALS AS SUCH I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTES WITH ME TODAY I HAVE CAN BE FOR. THE INYO COUNTY CLERK RECORDER AND REGISTER. OF VOTERS IN ADDITION TO ONE OF MY WITNESSES COULD NOT. BE IN ATTENDANCE TODAY. AND I'D ASK THE SERGEANTS TO PASS OUT THE HANDOUT SO IT MAY BE ENTERED INTO THE RECORD. AMIN. THANK YOU MR MATHIS YOUR WITNESS. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS COUNTY FOOT AND I'M ELECTED IN YOUR COUNTY CLERK RECORDER I'M HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN FIFTEEN. WHEN THIS PRIME WHEN SB TWO WAS PASSED LAST YEAR IT WAS INITIALLY UNCLEAR WHETHER OR NOT IT WOULD EVEN APPLY TO MINING CLAIM DOCUMENTS WE HAD MANY MANY CONVERSATIONS AMONGST COUNTY RECORDERS. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE MINING CLAIM DOCUMENTS ARE DIFFERENT THAN ALL OF THE OTHER DOCUMENTS LISTED ON IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE UNDER THIS SECTION. THEY ARE RECORDED AGAINST PUBLIC LANDS ONCE THE MINERALS ARE EXTRACTED THAT'S PERSONAL PROPERTY IN THE LAND ALWAYS REMAINS IN STATE AND FEDERAL OWNERSHIP WHICH IS EXPLICITLY EXEMPT FROM S. B. TO. SO INSTEAD. MINING CLAIM DOCUMENTS SEES ME NOT INSTEAD BUT THEY'RE ALSO UNIQUE IN ANOTHER WAY. AND AS MR MATHIS SAID EARLIER THEY ARE THE ONLY TYPE OF DOCUMENT THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT NEEDS TO BE RECORDED EVERY SINGLE YEAR IN ORDER FOR THE MINOR TO KEEP THEIR CLAIM. SO IT MINOR. WHO HAS? AS FOR INSTANCE FIVE CLAIMS THEY'RE GONNA PAY AROUND THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS EVERY SINGLE YEAR OR UP TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A TEN YEAR PERIOD IF YOU CONTRAST THAT WITH. THE TYPICAL HOMEOWNER WHO REFINANCES THEIR PROPERTY MAYBE TWICE IN THAT DECADE. THEY'RE ONLY GOING TO PAY FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS SO ROUGHLY AROUND TEN PERCENT OR A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN PERCENT OF WHAT THAT MINOR WILL PAY INTO THE HOUSING FIND. SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING WITH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FIFTEEN IS JUST AND EQUITABLE COLLECTION ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES AND ALL PROPERTY OWNERS. AND MAKE THAT CLARIFICATION CLEAR IN THE LAW. SO IN ADDITION A MINING CLAIMS WHEN ADDED TOGETHER. NOT ON THEIR OWN BUT Q. MASSIVELY OF MAKE UP A LARGE PORTION OF OUR LOCAL TAX BASE. SO AS THESE CLAIMS GO OUT OF EXISTENCE ARE LOCAL TAX BASE IN INYO COUNTY IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE REDUCED AND THEN WERE NOT ABLE TO RESPOND TO HELP OUR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AS ART ON REVENUES OVERALL GO DOWN. MOST MINES AND I WAS READING IN THE ANALYSIS IT SAYS THAT THE FEE WILL HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THE MINING INDUSTRY. BUT JUST LIKE ANY OTHER REGRESSIVE TAX. THIS IS ONLY TRUE FOR THE HANDFUL OF VERY PROFITABLE MINES IN THE STATE. IT'S A SMALL MINERS LIKE SEVENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD KATE CONDI WHO JUST LOST SEVEN CLAIMS LAST YEAR IN INYO COUNTY. OR LIKE MY FATHER WHO PASSED AWAY FIVE YEARS AGO YET THREE CLAIMS UP UNTIL THE DAY THAT HE DIED. THESE ARE SMALL MINERS THAT MAKE UP CUMULATIVELY A LARGE PORTION OF OUR TAX BASE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR TODAY IS JUST A CLARIFICATION. I WOULD JUST SAY ONE LAST POINT. ARM OF THE EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION DOCUMENTS RECORDED IN CALIFORNIA LAST YEAR. ONLY SIX THOUSAND OR LESS THAN ZERO POINT ZERO ONE PERCENT. WERE RELATED TO MINE SORT TALKING ABOUT A VERY VERY SMALL PORTION OF. THE OVERALL REVENUES I WAS JUST SPEAKING OF STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE ON MONDAY. IN THE FIRST QUARTER THIS FUND IS ALREADY RECEIVED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN COLLECTION AND THAT'S WITH TEN COUNTIES YET TO REMIT THEIR FUNDING FOR THE FIRST QUARTER SO IT'S WELL ON ITS WAY. TO MEET ITS PROJECTIONS AND WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR CLARIFICATION AND A VERY VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. SO I AM ASKING. THAT TODAY. THIS COMMITTEE WILL VOTE YES ND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FIFTEEN AND JOIN OTHER WESTERN STATES SUCH AS WASHINGTON AND OREGON TO THE SP TWO WAS MODELED AFTER. WHO HAVE ALSO EXEMPTED MINING CLAIMS FROM THIS ITEM HOUSING TAX? THANK YOU I MAKE A MOTION. VETERANS MADE A MOTION. LET ME ASK IF THERE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. IS THERE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. THE ONE OF. TO THE TABLE. THE MORNING CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS TYRONE BUCKLEY ON BEHALF OF HOUSING CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE TO STRENUOUSLY OBJECT TO THIS BILL AND OPPOSE IT TODAY. SP TO JUST PASSED LAST YEAR WE WERE ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF THAT LEGISLATION. IT TOOK YEARS AND YEARS TO GET THAT THE LEGISLATURE MULTIPLE ITERATIONS AND ULTIMATELY LAST YEAR WE'VE. ACHIEVED THE BUILDING HOMES AND JOBS ACT WHICH WILL BUILD BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. I'M IT'S AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE IT CREATES A RELIABLE AND STABLE AND PERMANENT SOURCE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS EVERY YEAR. AFFORDABLE HOUSING TAKES MULTIPLE YEARS TO PRODUCE TAKES. MULTIPLE. DIFFERENT SOURCES OF FUNDING TO PRODUCE AND. THE VALUE OF HAVING THIS HOUSING FUND AVAILABLE TO MAKE SURE TO BE THERE EVERY YEAR FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS IS VITAL. EXEMPTION SUCH AS THESE. REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THE BILL AND UNDERMINE THEPURPOSE WHICH AGAIN IS TO CREATE RELIABLE AND PERMITS OR STE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE ALSO ARE CONCERNED THAT ALLOWING EXEMPTION SUCH AS THESE WILL CREATE A SLIPPERY SLOPE. THAT WILL BRING EVERY INTEREST GROUP OUT OF THE WOODWORK TO. ULTIMATELY. SEEKING THE SAME TYPE OF EXEMPTION AND ULTIMATELY DECIMATE THE HOUSING TRUST FUND SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST OPPOSE. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MARIN HIGGINS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM I WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF. OF MY COLLEAGUE AND. ENDORSE THEM I WOULD ONLY JUST ADD THAT. THE FUND WAS JUST ESTABLISH SAYS AS HE SAID AND THE FUN AND THE MONIES HAVE JUST STARTED TO BE COLLECTED IN JANUARY AND WE'RE WAITING FOR THE FINAL AS WAS NOTED WE DON'T KNOW THE AMOUNT THAT WILL COME IN IN THE FIRST QUARTER. SO WE'RE STILL GETTING OUR SEA LEGS IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING WILL MEAN FOR THE STATE AND AS TYRONE SAID IT NEEDS TO BE YOU KNOW A STABLE RELIABLE SOURCE. AND THE MORE THAT WE START TO CREATE EXEMPTIONS IT WILL CREATE A SLIPPERY SLOPE AND UNDERMINE THE VALUE OF THE FUND TO THE STATE. WE HAVE A HOUSING BOND THAT'S ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT YET TO BE VOTED ON SO THIS IS THE THE LYNCH PIN OF AVAILABLE FUNDING UP FRONT RIGHT NOW THAT WE HAVE SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE OPPOSE THE BILL. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER. OPPONENTS. MICHAEL AND WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION A CALIFORNIA STRONGLY OPPOSE FOR THE REASONS STATED. THANKS VERY MUCH LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY DISCUSSION. MR MATHIS OF YOU AND I'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS IN THE FIRST. COMPLIMENT YOU FOR YOUR ADVOCACY FOR YOUR DISTRICT. I KNOW THAT THE MINING INDUSTRY IS ONE THAT IS CENTERED. IN YOUR PART OF THE STATE. IT IS AN IMPORTANT INDUSTRY IN OUR STATE AND. PLOT YOU FOR THINKING OF CREATIVE WAYS TO TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD. AS AS YOU AND I DISCUSSED OUR I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS BILL IN ITS CURRENT FORM. TODAY I AND I DO HAVE A NO RECOMMENDATION TO THIS COMMITTEE. I WILL SAY A FEW THINGS ABOUT IT. AS YOU HEARD AND YOU KNOW LAST YEAR THIS LEGISLATURE PASSED S. B. TWO AND IT WAS THE FIRST TIME AFTER MANY MANY YEARS OF DISCUSSION. THAT WE FINALLY ESTABLISH WITH A DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE TWO THIRDS VOTE. CREATING A PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE MOST INTENSE HOUSING CRISIS OUR STATE HAS HAD. ON AND THERE ARE NUMBER OF BILLS THAT HAVE SUGGESTED POTENTIAL EXCEPTIONS OR CARVE OUTS FOR SP TWO. ARE IN THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF OF COLLECTING THESE REVENUES AND AT THIS TIME GIVEN THE CRISIS GIVEN WHERE WE ARE I CAN'T SUPPORT CARVE OUTS. I ALSO WANT TO JUST MENTION WITH REGARDS TO THIS INDUSTRY I HEARD YOU USE PHRASES ABOUT HOW SB TWO COULD BE THE RUIN OF THIS INDUSTRY BUT YOU ALSO REFLECT THE FACT THAT THIS IS A VERY PROSPEROUS INDUSTRY. FROM MY PERSPECTIVE A SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS FEE IN THE CONTEXT OF A THREE POINT SEVEN SIX BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY. SEEMS DE MINIMUS AND AS YOUR WITNESS HAD POINTED OUT A MINING CLAIMS THE REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS ONLY REPRESENT I THINK YOU SAID ZERO POINT ZERO ONE PERCENT. OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE TALKING ABOUT SO. I DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THE THE THE FINANCIAL IMPACT ON YOUR INDUSTRY THAT I I KNOW YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. ALL THIS BEING SAID AS I SUGGESTED TO YOU I THINK THERE'S A DIFFERENT WAY IF THE MINE INDUSTRY IS IN FACT IN JEOPARDY. OF OF OF TRYING TO MOVE FOR OTHER POLICIES TO HELP IT. I JUST THINK THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF SP TO THE IDEA CARVE OUT AT THIS TIME IS NOT ONE THAT. I THOUGHT THAT I CAN SUPPORT I'M AND I DO WANT TO SAY TO A WITNESS WE HAD INTENDED WITH THE THE THE WRITING OF THIS BILL TO INCLUDE THE REAL ESTATE DOCUMENTS THAT WERE IN ITS UNFORTUNATELY. THAT DID CAPTURE ON THE DOCUMENTS WERE TALKING ABOUT AND THAT WAS PART OF THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT SO. SO THAT IS MY PERSPECTIVE ON THIS I I'M HAPPY TO HAVE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS. ON ONE LAST THOUGHT I HAD IS IF OUR MINING INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME ONLY AND CALIFORNIA MINERALS. I THINK THERE'S LESS OF A CONCERN ABOUT US LOSING MINING BUSINESS. WITH. MINERALS THAT ARE ONLY AVAILABLE IN OUR STATE TO OTHER STATES SO SO THAT ALSO SOMETHING THAT I'VE WAIT A AS I. CONSIDER MY PERSPECTIVE ON THAT SO. IT'S UNFORTUNATE WILL BE ABLE TO BE WITH YOU ON THIS BILL TODAY. BUT THE FOR TO FUTURE CONVERSATIONS. OTHER CONVERSATION. WITH THAT. BACK TO FOR. CLOSING COMMENTS. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THE YOU KNOW I THINK. I OFTENTIMES WE THINK A MINER'S WE THINK OF. AND AN OLD GUY WITH A BEARD WITH A PICKAXE WEARING OVERALLS OF GOLDEN TEETH AND THAT'S THAT'S NOT THE CASE. YOU KNOW MY LARGEST CONCERN IS AS WE'VE GONE OF THESE CONVERSATIONS. IS THE FACT OF. THE NEXT. BLESSEDLY WITH THE LITHIUM MARKETS. NINO EYES AS YOU STATED IN YOUR IN YOUR COMMENTS MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW THE CONCERN OF OF THE MINING INDUSTRY. IT'S MY BIGGEST CONCERN ISN'T NECESSARILY THE MINING INDUSTRY BUT IT'S OUR GREEN TECH INDUSTRY AND WHAT THE CAUSE OF THIS INFLATION WILL DO TO OUR STATE. AND THE BOOMING TECH ECONOMY THAT WE HAVE. DO THE ARGUMENTS MADE BY MAR OUR FOLKS THAT WERE PROPONENTS OF SP TO IN REGARDS TO. AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP HOUSING AFFORDABLE. AS. I STATED EARLIER. THERE'S A VOTE HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE SOLAR PANELS TO BE ON ALL NEW HOUSES IN CALIFORNIA. IF YOU INCREASE THE COST OF SOLAR. YOU THEN. INCREASE THE COST OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO TO ASK FOR A SMALL MINUTE AMOUNT. TO BE RELIEVED FOR THE MINING INDUSTRY WHICH IS THE ONLY INDUSTRY THAT HAVE TO DO THIS EVERY SINGLE YEAR. AGAIN EVERY SINGLE YEAR. ANYBODY ELSE THAT THE CLAIM. FIFTY YEARS GOES BY THAT THERE FIND IT ONCE IN A LIFETIME. FOR ARE MINING INDUSTRY IT'S EVERY SINGLE YEAR. THIS IS GONNA HAD INCREASED INFLATION IT'S GONNA. DRIVE THE COST OF SOLAR OF IT'S GOING TO DRIVE THE COST OF LITHIUM UP. JENNA CREATE INFLATION. ARE NEW HOUSING IS NOT GOING TO BE AFFORDABLE BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED COST. I JUST HOPE YOU ALL CONSIDER THAT AS WE TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING LET'S KEEP HOUSING AFFORDABLE LET'S KEEP SOLAR AFFORDABLE. AND LET'S KEEP GREEN TECH AFFORDABLE I ASK YOU FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU FOR THAT. AND I APPRECIATE CAN APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS APPRECIATE YOUR ADVOCACY AND. I DO THINK THAT IF THERE REALLY IS SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO HERE ARE PROPOSING. EH ATTACKS BREAK TO THIS INDUSTRY MIGHT BE% A OF A DIFFERENT WAY TO GO WHEN AND SOMETHING WE CAN CONSIDER. I'M I'M STILL NOT CONVINCED. THAT THERE IS GONNA BE THE IMPACT THAT I KNOW YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT AND. OBVIOUSLY WE'LL SEE THAT OVER TIME I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE RELATIVELY DE MINIMUS BUT. LOOK FOR TEN MONITORING THAT AS THESE REVENUES ARE COLLECTED UP WITH THAT. THERE'S A MOTION. TO MOVE THIS FORWARD BY. BY DOCTR CHOI AND THAT'S BEEN SECONDED. MADAM. SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING AUTHORITIES. AS YOU KNOW THE HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA DOES NOT ONLY AFFECT LOW INCOME BUT MIDDLE INCOME WORKING FAMILIES. AND THESE AUTHORITIES. ALSO PROVIDE FOR WORKFORCE HOUSING UP TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PERCENT. OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS MAKE UP ABOUT NINE PERCENT OF AN AVERAGE HOUSING PROJECTS COSTS. WITH THE STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES INVESTING SO MUCH INTO HOUSING WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE RELATED THESE PROJECT HIS UP TO CODE AND HAS THE CAPACITY. FOR THIS LARGER. AMOUNT OF. UNITS. AND THAT'S THE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL HOUSING DOLLARS. TO GO FURTHER ALSO. AB SEVENTEEN NINETY TWO EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF AN AUTHORITY TO INCLUDE PROVIDING FOR WATER SEWER ELECTRICAL STREETS AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY. FOR A VERY WORTHWHILE PROJECT.

MR MARTZ ITCHY HIGHER FILE ITEM FOR AB SEVENTEEN NINETY SIX. WELCOME. SIR. GOOD MORNING WITH SHARON MEMBERS THAT I AM HERE TO PERCENT EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN NINETY SIX. WHICH SEEKS TO REQUIRE LANDLORDS OF RENT CONTROLLED. APARTMENT TED DWELLINGS TO APPROVE. ELECTRIC VEHICLE INSULATION REQUESTS. THIS IS. AND AFTER THAT I. THAT I'M CONTINUING FROM. AND EARLIER BILL THAT I INTRODUCED IN MY FIRST TERM. WHICH WAS TO REQUIRE. ALL A WRECK ALL DWELLINGS TO ALLOW. TENANTS TO INSTALL ON THEIR OWN COST. ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS. AS WE ALL KNOW. THE EEVEE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS CRITICAL TO. ADVANCE CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP AND OUR FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE AND AGAINST AIR POLLUTION. GETTING. EXPANDING THE EEVEE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IS GOING TO LEAD TO. MEETING OUR. AGGRESSIVE GOALS OF GETTING MORE E. VIS ONTO OUR. ROADS IN OUR FREEWAYS. THIS IS. AN AREA THAT THAT WAS EXEMPTED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WITH MY EARLIER BELL. THAT SAID WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT A SPECIAL COMMITTEES LIKE IT'S YOUR CISCO WERE OVER SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF. THE AVAILABLE RENTAL STOCK IS. RENT CONTROL. THAT. ATTENDANCE OF RENT CONTROL UNITS I DESERVE TO BE ABLE TO INSULATE INSTALL AB CHARGING. STATIONS ON THEIR OWN DIME. I'M HERE TO. PRESENT THIS BILL WITH THE SUPPORT OF PAUL SCOTT OF PLUG IN AMERICA IN CORE BULLETS WITH ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATE ASSOCIATION. SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. YOUR WITNESSES. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS KORABL SOME HALF ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING ASSOCIATION. WE ARE A TRADE ASSOCIATION OF EVEN CHARGING COMPANIES THAT MANUFACTURE INSTALL AND OPERATE HEAVEY CHARGING EQUIPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SERVICES THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER CALLS FOR TUNER FIFTY THOUSAND EVEY CHARGING STATIONS TO BE PLOY TO BUY. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE AND OF THAT AMOUNT THE ENERGY COMMISSION HAS CALCULATED THAT AROUND A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND ARE GOING TO NEED TO BE AT. A MULTI UNIT DWELLINGS. AND MULTI UNIT DWELLINGS AND MANY OF THEM WHICH ARE RENTAL UNITS AS MR MERCHANT YOU STATED. THEY'RE A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK IN TERMS OF GETTING CHARGING STATIONS DEPLOYED ON THE GROUND. YOU KNOW OUR ASSOCIATION IN ITS MEMBERS STAND READY TO RISE TO THE CHALLENGE OF GETTING AS MANY CHARGING STATIONS DEPLOYED SO THAT WE CAN REACH OUR. GOALS BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BUT MANY BARRIERS REMAIN PERMITTING REGULATORY OR OTHERWISE THAT WOULD INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO DEPLOY THINGS. TO DEPLOY STATIONS ON THE GROUND A SEVENTEEN NINETY SIX WILL HELP. TAKE US A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BY BOLSTERING. CONSUMER ACCESS TO YOU THE STATIONS IN THE US ARM CONFIDENCE IN PURCHASING DVDS I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. I MEAN. MY NAME IS PAUL SKYPE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING ON TWO YEARS AGO I MET AND FELL IN LOVE WITH THE WOMAN WHO LIVES IN AN APARTMENT IN LOS ANGELES. AS WE GOT TO KNOW EACH OTHER I TOLD HER ABOUT ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND RENEWABLE ENERGY. AND CONVINCED HER THAT SHE SHOULD SWITCHER APARTMENTS ELECTRICITY TO A CLEAN SOURCE THROUGH HER UTILITY SHE DIDN'T IMMEDIATELY AND SHE HAS POWER HER HOME WITH CLEAN ELECTRICITY SENT. I ALSO CONVINCED HER TO GET A USED D. V. AS HER PARKING SPACE WAS ONLY FIFTY FEET AWAY FROM HER ELECTRICAL PANEL SO IT WOULD BE AN EASY TO INSTALL A CHARTER. HOWEVER WHEN I APPROACHED HER LANDLORD AND EXPLAINED WHAT WE WANTED TO DO THERE WAS NO RESPONSE AYE CAT CONTACTED THEM FIVE TIMES OVER SEVERAL MONTHS. EACH TIME EXPLAINING THAT WE WANTED TO INTALL A CHARGER FOR MTV. I KNEW ABOUT AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE BUT HE ALSO KNEW THEE WAS A CARVE OUT FOR RENT CONTROL APARTMENT MEANING THOSE RENTERS DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE THEIR OWN ELECTRICITY. TO POWER THEIR CARS. BARBOUR LIVES IN A RENT CONTROLLED APARTMENT SO HER LANDLORD COULD LEGALLY DENY HER THE RIGHT TO USE HER OWN CLEAN ELECTRICITY TO POWER HER CAR. THERE ARE NO PUBLIC CHARGERS IN HER NEIGHBORHOOD SO SHE COULD NOT GET THAT HE'D BE SHE CONTINUES DRIVING A GAS BURNING CAR TODAY. WHEN I SAW THAT THERE WAS A SINGLE FIFTEEN WORD LINE IN AB TWENTY FIVE SIXTY FIVE DISALLOWING RENT CONTROL TENANTS FROM HAVING THE RIGHT TO USED THEIR OWN CLEAN ENERGY TO POWER THEIR CARS. I CONTACTED ASSEMBLY MEMBER AMERITECH SOCHI AND ASKED IF HE WOULD WRITE A NEW LAW THAT CORRECTED THIS PROBLEM AND THAT'S HOW AB SEVENTEEN NINETY SIX CAME TO BE. FROM MY RESEARCH I'VE LEARNED THAT THERE OVER HALF A MILLION RENT CONTROL UNITS IN CALIFORNIA. NONE OF THOSE PEOPLE CAN SWITCH FROM BURNING GASOLINE UNLESS THEY HAVE ACCESS TO A CHARTER WHERE THEY WORK WHICH THE VAST MAJORITY DO NOT. THOUSANDS OF THESE PEOPLE WOULD PROBABLY SWITCH IMMEDIATELY IF THEY COULD INSTALL A CHARGER AT HOME THIS IS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF LOW HANGING FRUIT. USING DIRTY ENERGY ELECTRICITY FROM COAL AND GAS AND OIL FOR TRANSPORTATION. IS FOR MOST PEOPLE THE SINGLE WORST THING THEY DO IN THEIR ENTIRE LIVES. WITH AFFORDABLE ELECTRIC CARS AND LOW COST RENEWABLE ENERGY MOST PEOPLE CAN NOW SWITCH TO A CLEAN LOW IMPACT LAUGHED LIFESTYLE. BUT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THAT CLEAN ENERGY WITH THEIR CARS AB SEVENTEEN NINETY SIX WILL DO THAT FOR OVER HALF A MILLION CALIFORNIANS I URGE YOU TO PASS THIS BILL. THANK YOU. OTHER SUPPORTERS. BANKING. MORTON CARVE ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK ALSO IN SUPPORT. PULLING MEASURE BEHALF OF THE CITY OF WEST HOLLYWOOD ONE OF THE RENT CONTROLLED CITIES IN SUPPORT. CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKUP PRAYER I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF CHARGE POINT WE WERE.

THANK YOU. TOM EDISON WITH THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT IN SUPPORT. LET ME ASK IF THERE'S ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE HAVE ONE QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR WHY WAS THIS EXEMPTED IN YOUR FIRST BILL. O. THERE WERE SOME OBJECTIONS AND CONCERNS RAISED. ABOUT HER. SOME PERCEIVED TO. CONCERNS ABOUT INSTALLATION FOR RENT CONTROL UNITS BUT. APPARENTLY THOSE CONCERNS. ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT AT THIS POINT GREATLY HOT DE BASED ON NOW SEEN OPPOSITION. THERE'S BEEN FILED FOR BILL. I WILL SAY. AS SOME HAVE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF MOVING FORWARD THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE VISION FOR STATE IN A FEW YEARS AGO HAD PASSED A A A LOT TO HELP STREAMLINE THE INSTALLATION OF CHARGING STATIONS. AND AS SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS ONE OF THESE RENT CONTROL CITIES AND LIVED IN A RED CONTROL FOR TWENTY YEARS MYSELF AND WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AFFORD TO LIVE IN MY CITY BUT FOR THAT. I THINK THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE NO BRAINER IN HOW WE MOVE FORWARD ELECTRIC VEHICLES. AND REDUCE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OPTICALLY IN OUR DENSE URBAN CITIES. IF THIS BILL GETS OUT OF COMMITTEE I'M HAPPY TO AT MYSELF AS A CO AUTHOR TO THE BILL IF THAT IS THE PLEASURE OF THE AUTHOR. WITH THAT IS THERE ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION MISTER CHOI. YEAH I HAVE A. QUESTION I KNOW WOULD BE IN SUPPORT IN THE CONCEPT HOWEVER. THE IS SYSTEM REQUIRING PROPERTY OWNERS. TO ALLOW. IS SETTING UP BUT AYE EVEY AYE CHARGING.

I THESE PARKS I THE ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THEIR HOUSING STOCK. WITH REGARD TO THE URGENCY. IT IS. NOT ONLY DOES IT A FACT THE RESIDENTS AND. RANCHO MONSERRAT. THERE ARE MOBILE HOMES THAT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED AND SOME OF THE PARKS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. I THIS WILL ASSIST THEM IN BEING ABLE TO REPLACE HIM PUT IN NEW HOMES. WHICH IS OUR IMMEDIATE URGENT NEED OUR LONG TERM NEED IS THE PRESERVATION OF THIS AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND I REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. THANK YOU I'M WILLIAM SMITH I'M A MANUFACTURED HOME DEVELOPER MORTGAGE LOAN OFFICER AN OWNER OF MANUFACTURED HOMES IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY FIFTY FIVE PLUS. CONDOMINIUM DEVELOPMENTS. MY TESTIMONY IS ON BEHALF OF NINETEEN NINE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE OWNERS OF MANUFACTURED HOMES IN RANCHO MONSERRAT CHAMPAGNE VILLAGE AND LAKE JENNINGS PARK ESTATES. FORT CONDOMINIUM COMMUNITIES ARE DAMAGED BY THAT SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUILDING DEPARTMENTS REFUSAL. TO ISSUE FOR THIRTY THREE A PERMITS ADDITIONALLY SENIORS RECENTLY STRUCK BY TRAGEDY IN ONE OF THE COMMUNITIES ARE ESPECIALLY HARM. ON DECEMBER SEVENTH TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE LILAC FIRE DESTROYED SEVENTY FIVE MANUFACTURED HOMES AND SEVERELY DAMAGED OTHERS. IN THE FIFTY FIVE PLUS RANCHO MONSERRAT COMMUNITY NEAR FALLBROOK. THE COUNTY'S REFUSAL TO ISSUE FOR THIRTY THREE A PERMITS FOR THE NEW REPLACEMENT HOMES. FOR THE SIXTY THROUGH NINETEEN YEAR OLD HOMEOWNERS HAS COMPROMISED THEIR LIVES. AND FORTUNES BECAUSE WITHOUT THE FOUR THIRTY THREE EIGHT PERMITS. THERE FINANCING OPTIONS AND RECOVERIES ARE SERIOUSLY IMPEDED. THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUILDING DEPARTMENT REVISED ITS INTERPRETATION OF CODE SECTION EIGHTEEN FIVE FIVE ONE. IT REFUSES FOR THIRTY THREE A PERMITS OF A CONDO PLANS DEFINITION OF THE LIVING UNIT. DOES NOT SPECIFY THE DIRT OR SOIL UNDER THE HOME. IF A LIVING UNIT IS DESCRIBED AS A SEPARATE INTEREST IN A COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT. THE PERMIT HAS REFUSED. IT CONTINUES TO ISSUE FOR THIRTY THREE A PERMITS FOR CONDO UNITS WHERE THE LIVING UNIT DESCRIPTION INCLUDES THE GROUND OR THE SOIL IN EACH LOT. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THE LANGUAGE USED DECADES AGO WHEN THE KONDO PLANS WERE ORIGINALLY APPROVED. BEFORE IT'S REVISED INTERPRETATION THE DEPARTMENT ISSUED THE FOUR THIRTY THREE A PERMITS IN THE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES. WE CAN FIND NO OTHER JURISDICTION TAKING THE SAME POSITION AS THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUILDING DEPARTMENT. AB NINETEEN FORTY THREE CORRECTIONAL MISSION ARE OVERSIGHT THAT OCCURRED WHEN HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION EIGHTEEN FIVE FIVE ONE WAS DRAFTED. AND I BELIEVE NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. RESIDENTIAL UNITS OWNED AS A SEPARATE INTEREST IN A COMMON INTEREST DEVELOPMENT OR CONDOMINIUMS WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE DEFINITION OF REAL PROPERTY. SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUILDING DEPARTMENT IS RELYING ON THIS OMISSION FOR ITS PERMIT REFUSAL. HAD THE LANGUAGE CONTAINED IN AB NINETEEN FORTY THREE BEEN ISSUED TO ENCODE SECTION EIGHTEEN FIVE FIVE ONE WHEN IT WAS ORIGINATED WE WOULD NOT BE GATHERED HERE TODAY. WITHOUT A FOUR THIRTY THREE A A HOMES PROPERTY VALUE AND MARKETABILITY ARE REDUCED WHEN IT'S TIME TO SELL. BECAUSE MOST MANUFACTURED HOME MORTGAGE LENDERS REQUIRE FOR THIRTY THREE ABLE AS A LOAN CONDITION. WITHOUT A FOR THIRTY THREE A SELLERS MAY ONLY BE ABLE TO ATTRACT CASH BUYERS WHO TYPICALLY OFFER LESS THAN IF A MORTGAGE IS ATTAINABLE. THIS DIMINISHES HOME VALUES. CONVERSELY BEYER'S OF A PROPERTY WITHOUT A FOUR THIRTY THREE A ARE LIMITED TO THE FEWER NUMBER OF LENDERS. WHO ACCEPT THE FOUR THIRTY THREE C.? AS AN ALTERNATIVE. PLEASE LENDERS OFTEN CHARGE GREATER LOAN FEES AND HIGHER INTEREST RATES. THE COUNTY'S REFUSAL TO EACH OF THE FOUR THIRTY THREE A PERMITS ADVERSELY AFFECT ADVERSELY AFFECTS. TWELVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY ONE HOUSEHOLDS. AND BY OUR COUNT NEARLY THREE THOUSAND SENIORS IN FOR SAN DIEGO AREA CONDOMINIUM COMMUNITIES. WHO BLOCKED THEIR HOMES BELIEVING THAT THEY WERE PURCHASING REAL ESTATE? THAT INCLUDED THE LAND. AB NINETEEN FORTY THREE SOLVES THE PROBLEM FOR BOTH THE DESERVING SENIOR CITIZENS RESIDING IN THE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES. AND FOR THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO BUILDING DEPARTMENT. AS CALIFORNIA GRAPPLES WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING CORRECTING AN AGE OLD OVERSIGHT THROUGH LEGISLATION WITH FEW. IF ANY NEGATIVE OR FISCAL IMPACTS IS WHAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS DESERVE AND WHAT WE EXPECT. I URGE YOU TO HONOR AND SUPPORTER DESERVING SENIOR HOMEOWNERS BY APPROVING EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FORTY THREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT MISTER CHAIRMAN DAVID JONES A MAP THE CITY OF SAN MARCOS LIKE TO MAKE THE AUTHOR.

NOW WE KNOW THAT IF WERE ABLE TO CONVERT MOBILE HOMES FROM PERSONAL TO REAL PROPERTY THAT COULD PROVIDE BENEFITS TO THE HOMEOWNER INCLUDING BETTER ACCESS TO TRADITIONAL FORMS OF FINANCING. APPRECIATE YOUR WORK WITH MY STAFF AND FOR A TAKEN THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. AS I KNOW OUR STAFFS HAVE DISCUSSED I THINK THIS BILL PROBABLY MIGHT NEED A LITTLE MORE REFINING AS WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS TO GET IT. AT THE ISSUE YOU'RE TRYING TO TO DEAL WITH BUT I THINK I GIVEN THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR IT'S WORTHY OF US MOVING THIS FORWARD. TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE.

REPRESENTING A FORTY TWO AFFILIATES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WHERE THE SPONSOR OF THE MEASURE. AS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA REMAINS IN THE STATE OF CRISIS WHEN IT COMES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE SPECIFICALLY ARE THE LOWEST SINCE THE NINETEEN FORTIES AND TWELVE OF THE FIFTEEN MOST EXPENSIVE HOUSING MARKETS REMAIN IN CALIFORNIA. HABITAT FOR HUMANITY OTHER NONPROFIT HOME BUILDERS HAVE BEEN CREATING AFFORDABLE HOMEOWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORKING LOWER INCOME FAMILY STRUCTURE FOR ME FOR MANY YEARS. BUT REMAIN CONSULTATIONS BY THE RISING COST OF LAND AND CONSTRUCTION. IN SACRAMENTO AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE GREATEST HURDLE TO BUILDING MORE HOMES IS FINANCING AND THAT INCLUDES STATE LOCAL AND FEDERAL FUNDS BUT ALSO RAISING MONEY TO COVER AT THE GAP WITH PRIVATE SECTOR FUNDING. BETWEEN WHAT THE HOME COSTS AND WATER HABITAT FAMILIES ARE ABLE TO AFFORD TO PAY. HABITAT AFFILIATES ACROSS THE STATE BUILDING A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT WAYS MANY OF THEM HIGH DENSITY. UNITS I'M HERE IN SACRAMENTO SPECIFICALLY WE BUILT A HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO HOMES IN SACRAMENTO AND YOLO COUNTY. AND WE HAVE LANDS THAT HAS OVER FIVE ACRES BUT AM UNABLE TO BUILD ON% THAT LAND BECAUSE OF THE GAP IN FUNDING. TO AFFORD FOR INSTRUCTION THE COST OF HOUSING SO WELL WE COULD DEAFENING CREASE. THEIR HOUSES THAT WE BUILD TO MAKE A BIGGER IMPACT ON THE KNEE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING HERE IN OUR COMMUNITY FINANCING REMAINS ONE OF THE BIGGEST HURDLES. AND TO SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT A STORY OF A FAMILY WHO IS THAT THE TYPE OF FAMILIES THAT WE SERVE. AT A FILM IT WAS PROFILED ON NPR AND JUST RECENTLY AND THAT JIMMY AND PATTY GARRIDO THEY LIVE IN SOUTH LOS ANGELES AND THEY HAVE A FAMILY OF FOUR DAUGHTERS ALL OF WHOM WERE ON A ROLL STUDENTS. PATTY AND JIMMY BOTH WORK FULL TIME AS ASSISTANT MANAGERS AT A LOCAL RESTAURANT. AND SCRAPE BY AFFORDING THEIR. SIXTEEN HUNDRED DOLLAR. TWO BEDROOM. APARTMENT THAT THEY LIVE IN SUBSTANDARD CONDITIONS THE ENTIRE APARTMENT COMPLEXES OVERRUN WITH. INFESTATION OF OF. OF ROACHES AND SAD THE BUT RECENT STORMS OF BECAUSE HOLES IN THEIR DRY WHILE THEY PUT PICTURES UP TO COVER THE HOLES IN THE DRY WALL. AND THEIR RECENTLY TOLD THAT THEIR BUILDING HAD BEEN SOLD IN THE WOULD BE AFFECTED FROM THEIR HOUSE NAY BEEN OR THE APARTMENT LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO LIVE BUT THEY CAN'T FIND ANYTHING LESS THAN THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT NOW. MOVING SIXTY TO SEVENTY MILES AWAY FROM WHERE THEY LIVE WHICH TAKES THEM AWAY FROM THEIR SCHOOLS THEIR JOB THEIR DAUGHTERS AWAY FROM THE SCHOOLS WHETHER ALL HONOR STUDENTS. AND REALLY DISPLACES THEM AND. THIS IS THE TYPE OF FAMILY WE SERVE THEIR ON THE BRINK OF HOMELESSNESS THEY'RE WORKING VERY HARD TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE HOME THAT THEY HAVE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. BUT NEED A LEG UP IN PROVIDING AND THE AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR A FAMILY LIKE THIS SO THEY CAN STAY IN THERE. THEIR HOMES THEY CAN STAY IN THE COMMUNITIES TO THEIR CHILDREN ARE DISPLACED. THAT'S DOES THE TYPE OF THE FAMILIES THAT WORKS THAT WERE WORKING TO SERVE. I'M AND ONE INCREDIBLE STATISTIC THAT. ELECTED SHERIFF USE HALF OF ALL CALIFORNIANS BEEN MORE THAN THIRTY PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING EXPENSES AND ONE THIRD OF ALL HOUSEHOLDS SPEND MORE THAN FIFTY. PERCENT. AT THROUGH AS THE HOMEOWNERSHIP PROJECTS THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM ELIGIBILITY FROM THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM AND MINISTERED TO AT THROUGH THE TREASURER'S OFFICE IN THIS PROGRAM. WAS MODELED AFTER FLORIDA'S COMMUNICATIVE YUSHIN TAX CREDIT PROGRAM WHICH HELPS PROVIDE FINANCING TO TWENTY PERCENT OF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY'S BUILT IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA. WE HOPE TO REPLICATE THAT SAME FISCAL IMPACT AND FACILITATE THAT HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE PASSAGE OF AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY TWO TO PROVIDE MUCH NEED HOUSING FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES IN OUR STATE WITH AFFORDABLE. HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES AND WE HOPE TO GAIN YOUR SUPPORT NOT. THANK YOU LIKE SPEAKER. HOLLY FOR MANY I'M WITH WHITE HOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF HABITAT CALIFORNIA AND AGAIN I'M JUST HERE FOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT WE RESPECTFULLY ASK HER AYE VOTE. BREAK OTHER SUPPORTERS.

APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT EVERYONE'S DOWN ON IT. I DIDN'T WANT OUR COMMITTEE DID NOT ASK FOR AMENDMENTS BUT I WANNA POINT OUT ONE ASPECT OF THE ANALYSIS THAT I HOPE THAT YOU MAY CONSIDER FOR THE FUTURE. AND THAT IS POTENTIALLY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS IN FIVE YEARS OTHER TYPES OF TAX CREDITS HAVE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS SO THAT WE KNOW. FOR A TAX CREDIT HOW HOW MANY HOUSING UNITS WERE BUILT IN THE LOCATION OF THOSE UNITS IN THE. HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND REALLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT BOMB SO OUR HOPE IS THAT THAT IS AN AMENDMENT YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER TAKING AND FUTURE COMMITTEES I THINK WILL HELP IMPROVE THE BILL.

GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT. IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY EIGHT TODAY. AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY WILL PROVIDE THE COUNTY OF SAN MEDINA WITH AN ADDITIONAL MECHANISM TO DEVELOP OPERATE IN FINANCE MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING PROJECTS. WITH THIS LEGISLATION WE WILL GIVE INCENTIVES TO DEVELOPERS TO BUILD HOUSING PROJECTS FOR BOTH MIDDLE AND LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY OF SANTA DINO. THESE COMMUNITY SINCERE MEDINA COUNTY ARE LARGELY UNDERSERVED DUE TO THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS NECESSARY TO BUILD SUCH HOUSING. OUR SAY POLICIES OFTEN PREVENT LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS FROM CLIMB THE LADDER OUT OF POVERTY BECAUSE THEY MAKE TOO MUCH TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE. AND EVEN THEN PURE LOW INCOME HOUSING PROJECTS CAN PRODUCE UNINTENDED CYCLICAL AT FACTS OF FAMILIES LIVING IN HIGH POVERTY RESOURCE POOR AREAS. WE MUST TAKE IN ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH AND TACKLE THE HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA MAKING SURE THAT WE ADDRESS A GROWING MID IT MISSING MIDDLE THAT IS OFTEN FORGOTTEN POLICY DISCUSSIONS. ALLOWING THE COUNTY TO PRODUCE ADDITIONAL MIXED INCOME PROJECTS GIVES THEM THE FLEXIBILITY TO MAKE THE COST PENCIL OUT BY INCORPORATING MARKET RATE AND EVEN MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING TO HELP PAY FOR LOW OF THAT LOW INCOME. AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNDER THIS PROPOSAL EVERYONE IS GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED THIS LEGISLATION SPONSORED BY THE COUNTY OF SAN MEDINA WITH ME TODAY I UP GUS JOSLIN DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SAN MEDINA COUNTY HOUSING AUTHORITY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND TESTIFY. THE WITNESS GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN CHIU HONORABLE MEMBER MEMBERS OF THE OF THE COMMITTEE. I'M VERY HAPPY TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY EIGHT. AS A QUICK WAY BACK A BACKGROUND THE HOUSING AUTHORITY OF THE COUNTY OF SAN BERNARDINO ADMINISTERS THREE MAIN HOUSING PROGRAMS. THE HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER PROGRAM WHICH SERVES OVER TEN THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS. OF THESE UNITS ARE PRIVATELY OWNED WITH RENT SUBSIDIES PAID DIRECTLY TO THE LAND WHERE BY THE HOUSING AUTHORITY. THE PUBLIC HOUSING PROGRAM CURRENTLY SERVES FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY TWO HOUSEHOLDS THE USER UNITS THAT ARE OWNED AND MANAGED BY THE HOUSING AUTHORITY. BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED DIRECTLY BY THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT OR HUD. AND ARE RESTRICTED THE FAMILIES AT OR BELOW EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. GENERALLY THESE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS PAY APPROXIMATELY THIRTY PERCENT OF THEIR MONTHLY GROSS INCOME TOWARDS RENT. FINALLY THE HOW THE AGENCIES AUTHORITY OWN PORTFOLIO. IS A PROGRAM WHICH THE HOUSING AUTHORITY UNLIKE A LOT OF HOUSING AUTHORITIES. WE ARE. DEVELOPERS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND HAVE BEEN SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES UNDER UNDER THIS PROGRAM WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP OVER THE YEARS. OVER THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ALSO MIXED INCOME HOUSING. SOME MARKET RATE AT THAT WE CONTINUE TO OWN AND MANAGE. THE RENTAL REVENUES FROM THAT PROGRAM ARE FLEXIBLE. THEREFORE. WE WOULD. BE ABLE TO USE THIS FUNDING. UNDER. AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY EIGHT TO BEGIN TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES. WE CERTAINLY WILL NOT. TAKE AWAY FUNDING FROM OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS BUT. WITH THIS. PROGRAM UNDER SEVENTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WE WILL BE ABLE TO EXPAND OUR RESOURCES TO. BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF FOUR OF HOUSING FOR MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES. A A MAJORITY OF OF NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS BEING BUILT INTO THE LOW INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT PROGRAM. BECAUSE OF THEIR COMPETITIVE AND IT AND NATURE OF THAT PROGRAM THE MAJORITY OF THOSE HOUSING UNITS ARE BEING. BUILT. TO SUPPORT FAMILIES ADDED BELOW SIXTY PERCENT IN MY. ARE CONVERSELY THE RECENT STRONG ECONOMY HAS LED TO A SITUATION WHERE THE MAJORITY OF NEW MARKET RATE MULTI FAMILY CONSTRUCTION IS NOT AFFORDABLE FOR LOW. AND LOW TO MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES THE REALITY IS THAT THERE IS NO FUNDING. PROGRAM NO FUNDING SOURCE SPECIFICALLY FOR MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING. AND. THERE FOUR REALLY THERE IS NO. HOUSING BEING BUILT TODAY SPECIFICALLY FOR. THE WORKFORCE OR IN THE MIDDLE INCOME. AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY EIGHT ADDRESSES THIS DIRECTLY BY. ALLOWING A HOUSING AUTHORITY TO CREATE A NEW FUNDING STREAM. SPECIFICALLY TO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING FOR THE MIDDLE INCOME. AND. WITH THAT I URGE YOU DEVOID VOTE AYE ON AB SEVENTEEN SIXTY EIGHT. THANK YOU ARE THERE OTHER SUPPORTERS OF THE BILL. MARY ELLEN SHAKE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HOUSING AUTHORITIES WE WERE STRONG SUPPORTERS OF THE PILOT PROGRAM THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR. WERE VERY STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF HAVING YOU JOIN US IN THAT PILOT. GREAT. IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ANY DISCUSSION. MOTION WITH THE BILL THERE'S A SECOND. FOR CENTER THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. AS YOU'VE NOTED THIS IS AN EXPANSION OF WHAT WAS MEANT TO BE A PILOT PROGRAM IN SAN DIEGO AND SANTA CLARA AND AND TYPICALLY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I'D WANT US TO WAIT. TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WITH THAT PILOT PROGRAM IN THOSE TWO JURISDICTIONS. BUT. I AM WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY HAVE FOR A COUPLE REASONS ONE SAMBAR MEDINA WAS. A COUNTY THAT IS DIFFERENT FROM SAN DIEGO AND. SENT A CLEAR AND I THINK THAT IS WORTHY OF OUR CONSIDERATION AND. ALSO. I'M SYMPATHETIC TO THE FORMER VICE CHAIR OF THIS COMMITTEE PARTICULAR YOUR LAST YEAR FIGHTING FORCE AMBER MEDINA AND I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT THAT EXTENSION THE PILOT. THAT BEING SAID FOR OTHERS WHO MAY BE THINKING ABOUT THIS FOR THE FUTURE I DO WANT TO SEE THE DATA FROM THIS PILOT PROGRAM BEFORE WE CONTINUE WITH A MUCH LARGER EXPANSION SO I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT.

YOU BILLS OUT WAIT FOR OTHERS TO ADD ON THANK YOU. TWO MORE BILLS FROM OUR COMMITTEE DOCTOR WOULD. SO THE FILE ITEM NINE A. B. TWENTY NINE THIRTEEN. TO THE AUTHOR. MOTION MOVE IT FOR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ARE FIRST LIKE TO START BY THANKING THE COMMITTEES AND THEIR STAFF AND THE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION IS STILL EMERGING FROM THE WORST ECONOMIC DOWNTURN RECORDED IN THE LAST SIXTY YEARS. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO PRODUCE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND DWELLING UNITS EACH YEAR TO KEEP PACE WITH CURRENT DEMAND. SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIVE THERE'S BEEN A BUILDING DEFICIT. CURRENTLY WE HAVE ACCUMULATED A HOUSING DEFINITE DEFICIT OF ONE POINT TWO MILLION UNITS. WITH THE NUMBERS CONTINUING TO GROW. WHILE HOMEBUILDING CONTINUES THE MARKETABILITY OF HOME CONSTRUCTION WITHIN A REGION CAN CHANGE RAPIDLY PROMPTING PROJECTS TO TEMPORARILY SLOW DOWN. OR CEASE OPERATION FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. THERE ARE NUMBER REASONS FOR THESE DELAYS LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS COMMUNITY REACTIONS THE AVAILABILITY OF BUILDING MATERIALS AND EVEN LABOR. THESE ACTORS ARE EXASPERATED IN AREAS IMPACTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS SUCH AS FIRES AS THE FIRES OF STRUCK ON MY DISTRICT. HOWEVER THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE STATEWIDE. CURRENT LAWS ALLOW THESE BUILDING PERMITS APPLICATIONS TO BE VALID FOR EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY DAYS. WHILE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO EXTEND THESE PERMITS IS OFTEN DONE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS CREATING UNCERTAINTY TO THE LOCAL. TO THE LOCAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY SOME JURISDICTIONS HAVE TAKEN SPECIFIC ACTION TO PROVE PROHIBIT THE EXTENSION OF BUILDING PERMITS. AND REQUIRE THEM TO RESTART THE APPLICATION PROCESS AND PAY ADDITIONAL FEES. AB TWENTY NINE THIRTEEN WOULD PROVIDE THAT A PERMIT. REMAINS VALID IF THE WORK ON THE SITE IS AUTHORIZED BY PERMIT IS COMMENCED WITHIN THREE YEARS OF A PERMIT BEING ISSUED. HAVING TO PERMIT REMAIN VALID FOR THREE YEARS IS NOT UNPRECEDENTED. PERMITS FOR MANUFACTURED HOUSING REMAIN VALID FOR THREE YEARS. THE LONGSTANDING REASON FOR THIS IS TO PROMOTE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. RECOGNIZING THE GOING TO THE END OF THE LOCAL PERMIT LINE CREATES DELAYS AND ADDED COSTS. CALIFORNIA UPDATES AS BUILDING CODES EVERY EIGHTEEN MONTHS IN ISSUES NEW ADDITIONS OF OF THE CODE EVERY SIX MONTHS. WELL WELL INTENDED THIS CONSTANT CHANGE CAN INADVERTENTLY CREATED MINISTRY OF HURDLES FOR PROJECT WHICH IS DESIGNED TO ONE SET OF CODES ONLY TO FIND THEY MUST GO BACK AN INCORPORATE DESIGN UPGRADES. MANDATED BY THE CHANGING STATE BUILDING CODES. I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS NARROWING THE BILL RELATED TO. SPENDER ABANDONED WORK THAT STRIKES OUTLINES TWENTY THREE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE ON PAGE TWO. AND LINES FIVE TO EIGHT ON PAGE THREE. AND. TO SUNSET THE PROGRAM AFTER FIVE YEARS. HERE AT TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS IS SILVIO FERRARI. THE SECOND WRAPPED ITS. GREAT THANK YOU GOOD MORNING ESTAMOS THURMOND COMMITTEE MEMBERS SO AGAIN SILVIO PRIME HALF CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OF THE CBI GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE HAS THOROUGHLY REVIEWED DISCUSSED AND THEY HAVE FLAG THIS AS A HOUSING CREATOR. WE BELIEVE THIS IS IMPORTANT. I THINK WE'RE ALL WELL AWARE NAPRAVI DON'T NEED TO GO INTO GREAT DETAIL ABOUT JUST HOW. DIFFICULT IT IS AND IT TO BRING HOUSING TO THE MARKING CALIFORNIA ARM IT'S QUITE OFTEN IT TAKES YEARS YOU CAN TAKE DECADES TO BE IN A POSITION ON A PROJECT TO PUT YOUR VERY FIRST STICK IN THE GROUND. AND YOU WOULD THINK AFTER ALL THAT TIME ALL THAT EXPENSE ALL THAT EFFORTS. THAT YOUR PERMIT ONCE IT'S IN HAND WOULD NOT ONLY BE A VALID FOR SIX MONTHS THAT JUST KIND OF IS MIND BOGGLING THAT DOWN IT WOULD ONLY BE AVAILABLE TO YOU FOR SIX MONTHS BEFORE IT EXPIRES. WE HAVE EXISTING LAW ON THE BOOKS RIGHT NOW FOR MANUFACTURED HOUSING. THEIR PERMITS ARE VALID FOR THREE YEARS AT THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT HAS LONG SAID THAT THE REASON FOR THAT IS TO TRY TO PROMOTE HOUSING AFFORDABILITY. WE THINK THAT. SAME CONCERN SHOULD BE AFFORDED TO. RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION THAT I IS BUILT IN THE SITE THAT IS FAR MORE DIFFICULT FAR MORE COMPLEX AND. OFTEN A HAS FOR MORE ISSUES DURING THE ACTUAL TIME. GETTING TO THAT POINT. ARMS WE BELIEVE IT MAKES ALL THE SENSE THE WORLD TO EXTEND THIS TO ADD TO THAT SITE BILL CONSTRUCTION. ALSO. AS. MANY SIM AND JUST SAID YOU KNOW IT WOULD CREATE A LOT MORE CERTAINTY FOR US BECAUSE IT WOULD A LINE THREE YEAR PERMIT VALIDITY. TO BOB THE BUILDING CODE PROCESS SO WE WOULD NOT HAVE UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES COME UP THAT CAN ULTIMATELY DRIVE UP THE COST SAID A PROJECT BACK DOWN THE ROAD. SO AGAIN ARE WE REALLY BELIEVE THIS IS A SIMPLE A MODEST BILL HAVING HAVE TO REALLY POSITIVE IMPACT ON IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WHICH IS URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHER SUPPORTERS. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS YELLING AVERAGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JADWIGA SEVERE WITH A CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE IN SUPPORT. MICHAEL AND WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT. ONE MISTER CHAIRMAN JOHN CABOT TECH ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. CHERRY MEMBERS RJ SAMANTHA SOME BE HALF OF A CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATION A SPECIALTY CONTRACTORS IN SUPPORT. THAT'S OUR ASK IF THERE IS OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. JASON RILEY CALIFORNIA CITIES. WE POLICY OUT FORGET OR LATER IT WILL BE LATE DIDN'T HANDLE YESTERDAY. IT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MEASURE WAS GONNA BE A NARROW TO DO MORE THE DISASTER. AND IT YOU KNOW IT IT WE CERTAINLY SUPPORT THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS BUT I THINK THERE ARE TWO THINGS REALLY. AT ISSUE HERE ONE IS THE. YOU DON'T CHANGE YOU KNOW THE BUILDING CODES DURING A CERTAIN MY TIME IN THE PROVIDE SOME UNCERTAIN HELPERS. WE CERTAINLY SYMPATHIZE WITH THAT ISSUE THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE ARE MOST CONCERNED WITH IS THAT THREE YEAR DELAY ONCE THE PERMIT IS PULLED. AND IT SEEMS THAT THAT IS CONTRARY TO THE OF THE FIFTEEN BILL PACKAGE THAT WE CALL YOU NOTING DEBATED LAST YEAR. AND AB SEVENTY THREE THE THE CHAIRMAN'S BILL THAT STREAMLINED THE PROCESS SO BUILDER COULD ACTUALLY USE YOUR MEASURE TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS PULLED BUILDING FROM IT AND I'M BILL FOR THREE YEARS. AND IF WE ARE HOUSING CRISIS WHICH I THINK WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE WE THINK WE NEED TO BUILD AS MUCH AS WE CAN AS FAST AS WE CAN AND WE THINK THAT PROVISION ALONE. WILL DELAY IT FOR THREE OR SOME LITTLE UNSURE HOW DELAYING FOR THREE YEARS IS GOING TO LEAD TO MORE HOUSING AND WHAT HAVE YOU THE MEMBERS ARE EXCEPT IT WOULD CERTAINLY. TRUMP AUTOPSY. THANK YOU NEXT. OPPOSITION. CITY GEORGE HERBS AND AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION WE HAVE ISSUES SIMILAR TO THE LEAGUE. AND WE ALSO. DO WOULD SUPPORT ALL OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AS WELL BUT WE ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE. JUST FOR THAT DISASTER AREAS WHICH WE WOULD SUPPORT SO WE DO ALSO APOLOGIZE FOR MIKE IN THEIR LETTER IN. GOOD MORNING TRACY RYAN ROW KIND OF ABSENCE OF CALIFORNIA ALSO POSE LESS AMENDED FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED THINKING. GREAT LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE UP LET ME MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK THERE WAS A BIT OF CONFUSION AROUND THIS BILL. A LOT OF FOLKS HAD UNDERSTOOD THIS TO BE FOCUSED ON ON. DISASTER AREAS AND THAT ACTION IS NOT WHAT THE BILL WAS DRAFTED TO DO BUT I DO KNOW THERE WAS THAT. THAT WAS THERE WAS A PERCEPTION AND THAT. THE AMENDMENT THAT WE HAD SUGGESTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES THAT WE DO THAT IS ONE THAT. I STILL. THINK. WOULD MAKE SENSE THAT BEING SAID WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT. WITH A ON THE PREMISE THAT WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF AN INTENSE HOUSING CRISIS AND THAT WHILE WE HAVE DISASTER AREAS THAT HAVE A PARTICULAR EXACERBATED SITUATION. THAT CRISIS IS ALSO EXACERBATED OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE AND SO AT THIS TIME THAT AMENDMENT IS NOT GOING TO BE TAKEN BUT I DO THINK IT IS A WORTHY CONVERSATION THAT WE SHOULD. CONTINUE ON I DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S. ACCEPTANCE OF OTHER AMENDMENTS ARE TO ALLOW THE PERMIT TO REMAIN VALID FOR THREE YEARS FROM THE DATE THAT IT'S ISSUED BUT NOT TO ALLOW FOR AN EXTENSION OF AN ADDITIONAL THREE YEARS. IF WORK IS ABANDONED OR SUSPENDED. AS WAS NOTED IN THE ANNOUNCES THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING OFFICIALS WHO HAD OPPOSED THE BILL. HAD CONCERNS ABOUT WORK STONE'S AND CONSTRUCTION SITES BEEN ABANDONED FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. POTENTIAL MAKESHIFT SHELTERS FOR. THAT MIGHT CREATE HEALTH AND SAFETY HAZARDS THAT IS CONCERNED I'VE SHARED AS WELL AND THE AUTHOR AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT. AND I'D LOVE A LITTLE BIT OF CONVERSATION ON THAT I DO THINK THAT. THE AMENDMENTS NARROW OF THE LENGTH OF TIME AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED BUT. THERE IS A DISTANCE BETWEEN SIX MONTHS AND THREE YEARS. WE'D INITIALLY SUGGESTED A YEAR AND A HALF WHICH AGAIN I STILL THINK MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE. THIS IS AN ONGOING CONVERSATION BUT I WANTED TO MENTION WHERE THE MOMENTS OF LANDED. AND I DO. ALSO APPRECIATE A A SUNSET DATE ON THIS UP FOR FIVE YEARS. WE IT'S WE HAD SUPPORTED THREE. THE AUTHOR WOULD PREFER FOR THIS TO BE A DEFINITE. WE CAME TO FIVE. THAT DOES NOT GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS IS GOING TO GO SO THIS BILL HAS BEEN A BIT OF A WORK IN PROGRESS. WITH A NUMBER STAKEHOLDERS AND I DO HOPE AND I KNOW THAT THE AUTHOR WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION CERTAINLY NOW. THAT THERE'S MORE CLARITY ON EXACTLY WHAT THE BILL IS BUT. WANNA JUST TURN BACK TO THE AUTHOR IF YOU HAVE COMMENTS YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE BASED ON SOME OF THE FEEDBACK YOU'VE HEARD. WELL FIRST OF ALL. IT IS IT WHEN WE LOOK YOU LOOK AT OUR FACT SHEET ABOUT THIS BILL WE DO REFERENCE OF FIRES BUT WE ALSO REFERENCES TO THIS WE BELIEVE THIS IS A STATEWIDE ISSUE. SO WAS. MY DOOR'S BEEN OPEN ON THIS AND. IF THERE WAS CONFUSION ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS WELCOME TO COME AND TALK TO US BUT WE NEVER. EVER SAID THAT WE WERE GONNA LIMIT THIS JUST TO THE FIRE AREAS SO SO I WAS QUITE FRANKLY SURPRISED BY THE OPPOSITION A BASED UPON THAT. UP IT'S REALLY NOT IN THE INTEREST OF A BUILDER TO DELAY THERE ARE THINGS THAT HAPPEN HOWEVER THAT THAT CAUSED DELAYS. AND A WHAT BUILDERS REALLY WANT HIS CERTAINTY AND WHEN THAT WHEN A PERMIT EXPIRES AFTER SIX MONTHS AND THEN BUILDING CODES CHANGE AND THAT THEY HAVE TO RE APPLY ADDITIONAL FEES. THAT ISN'T HELPING OUR HOUSING CRISIS POINT AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS IS TO CREATE A SYSTEM WHERE WE ACTUALLY HAVE SOME CERTAINTY FOR BUILDERS. A UNIFORM STANDARD FOR BUILDERS AND TO GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT THEY DO BEST NOT TO BUILD HOUSES. IS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE RECOGNIZING THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES AT TIMES IN ACTUALLY GETTING THAT DONE NOBODY WANTS THAT NOBODY WANTS TO. IF YOU'RE A BILL TO EAT THE LAST THING YOU WANT IS TO LEAVE YOUR PROJECT ABANDONED. YOU WANT TO GET THAT DONE AS QUICKLY AND AS YOU CAN BECAUSE YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW. PAPER PAY FOR YOUR OWN BILLS AND MOVE ON WITH YOUR OWN FAMILY SO SO I I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH PEOPLE ON THIS BILL I ALWAYS DO AND. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO IT HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS SOME QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS DO YOU HAVE ANY. THAT I WAS GOING. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION. OKAY WANT ONE FINAL COMMENT ALL MAKE OUT. I A I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT IS SORT OF UNDERLINE THIS I DO THINK SIX MONTHS IS A BIT TOO SHORT. IS THREE YEARS THE RIGHT TIME FRAME I THINK THAT'S UP FOR DISCUSSION ARE I DO ON THE ONE HAND. UNDERSTAND THAT BUILDERS DO NOT HAVE. A BIG INCENTIVE TO DELAY PROJECTS YOU WANNA GET PROJECTS DONE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. OF BUT I ALSO WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS NOT BEING USED AS A WAY TO AVOID BUILDING STANDARD UPDATES THAT ARE IMPORTANT SIGNIFICANT. AND. AND WHILE IF THERE'S A WILDFIRE OR ANOTHER DISASTER TO BUILDERS NOT ABLE TO BILL BECAUSE OF THAT. THAT IS I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE VERY LEGITIMATE REASON FOR ALLOWING A PERMIT TO CONTINUE. IF ON THE OTHER HAND THERE'S A DELAY BECAUSE LABOR COSTS HAVE RISEN OR MATERIAL COSTS HAVE RISEN AND THAT IS WHY. WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE CONSTRUCTION. FOR A COUPLE YEARS THAT IS A LITTLE LESS PERSUASIVE TO ME SO I I DO THINK VERY MUCH THAT THIS IS A CONVERSATION THAT IS IN FLUX AND AND NEEDS TO HAPPEN. THAT WE OTHER COMMITTEES I THINK IT'S A WORTHY CONVERSATION BEFORE AND NOW SOMEONE TO. MOVE THIS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE WITH THE AMENDMENTS WE'VE JUST DISCUSSED BUT DON'T LOOK FOR THE FOR THE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS. AND WITHOUT HUMAN EMOTION. OKAY MOTION BY MISTER MAIENSCHEIN AND. WE NEED A SECOND SECOND BY MISTER GLORIA. AND. MADAM SECRETARY LET'S CALL THE ROLL. MOTION TO PASS AS AMENDED CHIU AYE TO AYE MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN NINE CHAU. CHOI. CHOI AYE GLORIA. GLORIA AYE LIMA. LIMA I. WOULD I WOULD I. RIGHT BILLS OUT. OF FINAL ITEM IS MINE AND I'M GONNA TURN THE GAVEL OVER TO OUR VICE CHAIR JEFF. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES THIS BILL WOULD GIVE A PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION FOR RENTAL HOUSING UNITS. DESIGNATED FOR MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS OTHERWISE KNOWN AS A SO CALLED MISSING MIDDLE IN HIGH COST AREAS OF THE STATE. THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE PLIGHT OF MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS DURING THE WORST HOUSING CRISIS OUR STATE HAS EVER EXPERIENCED. ARE IMPACTING THE SO CALLED MISSING MIDDLE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOUSEHOLDS THAT CAN'T AFFORD MARKET RATE HOUSING. BUT EARNED TOO MUCH TO QUALIFY FOR SUBSIDIZED LOW INCOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE MISSING MIDDLE INCLUDES TEACHERS FIREFIGHTERS EMERGENCY RESPONDERS HEALTHCARE WORKERS CHILDCARE RETAIL WORKERS ALL CRITICAL TO OUR COMMUNITIES. OFTEN COMMUNITY EXHAUSTING HOURS IN GRIDLOCK TRAFFIC EVERY WEEK FROM LOWER COST PARTS OF OUR STATE TO HIGHER COST JOBS CENTERS. AB THIRTY ONE FIFTY TO WOULD PROVIDE A PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION TO DEVELOPERS FOR RENTAL HOUSING FOR MODERATE INCOME HOUSING. THOSE MAKING BETWEEN EIGHTY AND HUNDRED TWENTY PERCENT AM I IN HIGH COST AREAS OF OUR STATE. THE SAVINGS FROM THE PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION WOULD BE USED TO REDUCE RENTS TO MODERATE INCOME LEVELS. DEVELOPERS WOULD ONLY BE ALLOWED ALLOWED TO CHARGE TENANTS THIRTY PERCENT OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME FOR RENT. AND THE RATE OF RENT WOULD BE TEN PERCENT BELOW THE FAIR MARKET RENT AS DETERMINED BY HUD. THE BILL WOULD NOT PROVIDE THAT WOULD NOT TAKE RESOURCES FROM LOWER INCOME UNITS THAT RECEIVE FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING. ARM AND AS WE ADDRESS OUR CRISIS I DO HOPE WOMAN FOR WITH INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS AND WE'RE. NOT PUTTING FORTH THIS IDEA TO ADDRESS WHAT HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT. MISSING COMPONENT OF OUR HOUSING STRATEGY WITH THAT LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR WITNESSES. AM GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS AMY CHAN FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO MAYOR'S OFFICE OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. AND ON BEHALF OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO I'M HERE TO TESTIFY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ARE HOW ARE CITY INCLUDING OTHER HIGH SCHOOL AND AND OTHER HIGH COST CITIES ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET THE HOUSING NEEDS OF MODERATE AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES. WE WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE OF THE MISSING METAL. WE'RE CURRENTLY SEEING THAT THE MARKET IS REALLY ONLY SERVING FAMILIES AT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PERCENT OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME IN ABOVE AND NOT MEETING THE. HOUSING NEEDS OF THE MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES AT EIGHTY TO HUNDRED TWENTY PERCENT OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME. AND JUST AS AN EXAMPLE IN SAN FRANCISCO AVERAGE TWO BEDROOM RENTS CAN BE AS HIGH AS FORTY TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS. WHERE IS A FAMILY OF THREE IN THE MODERATE INCOME BRACKET? I CAN ONLY AFFORD TO PAY BETWEEN TWO TO THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH SO THAT LEAVES IT AFFORDABILITY GAP OF A THOUSAND TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE SEEING. MODERATE AND MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES LEAVE THE CITY. AND TEACHERS ALSO LEAVING THE CITY. SO ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WHERE I'M STRUGGLING TO MEET THE HOUSING NEEDS. OF. OF MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES IS ALSO THAT THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION IS INCREDIBLY HIGH AND BECAUSE THERE ARE VERY FEW STATE AND FEDERAL SUBSIDIES. UMP FOR BUILDING. HIGH HOUSING FOR ADDED THESE FAMILIES. ARE SAN FRANCISCO'S ACTUALLY SUBSIDIZING MODERATE INCOME UNITS AT ROUGHLY A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER BY MORE PER UNIT FOR MODERATE INCOME UNITS. COMPARED TO A VERY LOW A LOW INCOME UNIT. AND THE CITY IS INVESTING FUNDS INTO BUILDING MORE. UNITS FOR MIDDLE INCOME FAMILIES AND THREE TWENTY FIFTEEN HOUSING BONDS SAN FRANCISCO'S INVESTING EMAIL HAS BEEN INVESTING EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A MODERATE INCOME PRODUCTION. BUT THESE FUNDS GENERATE ABOUT ONLY TWO HUNDRED UNITS TOTAL WHERE IS I'M OUR NEED FOR MODERATE INCOME UNITS IS. ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND UNITS. SOBRE IN DIRE NEED OF ME I DIRE NEED OF MORE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AND AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTION IS TO EXPAND THE WELFARE TAX EXEMPTION TO UNITS SERVING UP TO HUNDRED TWENTY PERCENT OF AND MY. AND THIS WOULD BE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO INCENTIVIZE. GREATER PRODUCTION BY REDUCING THE OPERATING COSTS OF THESE UNITS I'M WHICH WOULD IN TURN ALLOW HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE MORE DEBT TO PRODUCE THESE UNITS AND THEREBY ALSO. REDUCING THE SUBSIDY OF. THE CITY. FOR. FOR PRODUCTION AND THAT WOULD ALLOW OUR RESOURCES TO STRETCH A STRETCH FURTHER ON TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN OUR PIPELINE. AND WE JUST SEE A TREMENDOUS PUBLIC BENEFIT OF CREATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR OUR. MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES AND WE AYE AYE ORIGIN AYE VOTE FOR THE BILL THINK YOU. THE CHAIRMAN CHINA MEMBERS MICHAEL IN WITH THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION TO CALIFORNIA AND MORE AND MORE IS OUR IS OUR NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS APPEAR BEFORE PLANNING COMMISSIONS AND CITY COUNCILS. THEY'RE BEING ASKED TO TRY TO INCLUDE SOME THIS MISSING MIDDLE MODERATE INCOME HOUSING IN A LARGER LOWER INCOME HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AND TO DATE WE HAVE TO SAY I REALLY DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS THE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. THIS BILL REPRESENTS AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO BE ABLE TO HELP US MEET THOSE NEEDS AND RESPOND TO REQUESTS FROM CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS OF YOUR DRIVER. IF YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT HIS NAME ORGANIZATION ONLY PLEASE MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MARIN HIGGINS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CONSORTIUM WE ARE PLEASED TO COSPONSOR THIS BILL STRONG SUPPORT. HERE ALLEN SHAKE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HOUSING pFINANCE AGENCIES IN STRONG SUPPORT. THAT'LL HELP US GET THAT PILOT GOING. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AMBER'S MY NAME'S KEY CEO CARL LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR FOR BO WE VICE CHAIR FIONA MA STRONG SUPPORT THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. REBEKAH MARCUS REPRESENTING LEADING AGE CALIFORNIA AND SUPPORT. TIFFANY VAN WE HAVE TO BRIDGE HOUSING IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SEE NO OTHER WITNESSES AND SUPPORT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEN NOW HAD ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE. ALL MISTER TRUCK. YEAH BOTH OVER A. APPRECIATE OF FOR YOUR. BEARDED OUT TO ENCOURAGE A NEW. AFFORDABLE HOUSING THIS IS A CERTAINLY A GOOD INCENTIVE FOR. ONE OF THE. THE CONDITIONS USED TO TEN PERCENT OR MORE. BELOW MARKET RATE THE HOW. WOULD YOU DETERMINE THAT BECAUSE. THE IN DEPTH TONY SO ANTI OF TONY AVERAGE JOE YOU TALKING ABOUT DIE BECAUSE SAYS TO HOUSE TO HOUSE SO WHAT AREA THE. AVERAGE PRICE MAYBE. THERE WAS CRIED DETERMINE THAT DEALT WITH THAT THAT HAS QUALIFY TEMPERS. BELOW. SO WE WOULD BE DETERMINED BY THE FAIR MARKET RENT. SET BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE FEDERAL EPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT SO FEDERAL HIDE. THEIR SAID EVERY FIVE YEARS AND. THAT IS. THAT IS THE BEST WAY WE FIGURED OUT TO IT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT FOR MARKET RENT IS. SO THE IDEAS THAT WE PROVIDE A PROPERTY TAX BREAK TO DEVELOPERS AYE IN ORDER FOR THEM TO SET RENTS A BIT LOWER THAN. THEN THEN THE MARKET RENTS. SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS THIS PORTION OF THE MARKET AND TO THE POINT WHERE SPONSORS TO DO THIS MUCH MORE CHEAPLY. THAN IT WOULD COST US TO BUILD OTHER KINDS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO HOUSING DEVELOPERS MUST BE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS SO. DOES. IT PROFIT. PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS SO THIS IDEA ACTUALLY CAME TO ME FROM SOME FOR PROFIT DEVELOPERS WHO REALLY WANT TO ADDRESS THE CRISIS. OF THE HOLLOWING OUT OF MIDDLE CLASS RESIDENTS ARE IN SOME OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE AREAS IN CALIFORNIA. ARM AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THE HOUSING THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED. IS EITHER IS ONLY AFFORDABLE TO VERY WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS MARKET RATE HOUSING OR A. LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS QUALIFY FOR CURRENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT THE ENTIRE MIDDLE CLASS IS ESSENTIALLY SHUT OUT OF OF THE REGIONS SO. WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO AND SCENTED WITH THIS. WITH WITH WITH THIS SITE WITH THIS TAX INCENTIVE. HOW WOULD IT HURT IF YOU OPEN UP BUT ANY YOU KNOW? FOR PROFIT OR NONPROFIT THE IF THE MARKET RATE THAT THE CHARGES OF TEMPUS AND BELOW THAT IS SO GOOD WITH THE ENCOURAGEMENT FOR ANYONE TO. CONSTRUCT MORE AFFORDABLE HOMES. I AM SO I'M NOT SURE I FOLLOW YOUR QUESTION SO WHY WOULD YOU LIMIT ONLY TO NON PROFITS. THE CUT FORTUNATELY THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION REQUIRES THAT NON PROFITS BE INVOLVED BECAUSE THIS IS A PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION AND SO. UNDER THE CONSTITUTION IT'S REQUIRED IF THAT WASN'T THE CASE WE WILL WELL I I'D ACTUALLY ASSETS IN QUESTION TO MY STAFF. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT IS SO HOT THAT IS THE CASE I'LL JUST MENTION THIS BILL DID RECEIVE A STRONG BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. OF FROM THE READING TAX COMMITTEE I THINK THEY'RE MANY FOLKS AND. ON THE OTHER SIDE THE AISLE THAT APPRECIATED THE FACT THAT THIS WAS. REDUCING PROPERTY TAXES FOR DEVELOPERS TO AND SENT THEM TO DO A HOPEFULLY THE RIGHT THING IN THIS AREA. AND AGAIN WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I DO HAVE A MOTION. SAVE A MOTION A SECOND AT JUST REALLY BRIEFLY I'M. MISTER CHAIR THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR CONTINUED LEADERSHIP AND AS YOU HAVE ON ALL ISSUES AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE NOT I THINK THE TEXT.
