OTHER VIOLATIONS. AND IT ALSO

00:59:00.603 --> 00:59:03.006
PROTECTS RESIDENTS FROM USING

00:59:03.072 --> 00:59:04.173
THESE CAMERAS FROM CITIES WHO

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:06.242
WANT TO PAD THEIR GENERAL FUND.

00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:07.710
AND WE DESIGNED THE BILL SAYING

00:59:07.777 --> 00:59:09.545
THAT THAT MONEY CANNOT GO TO

00:59:09.612 --> 00:59:10.546

00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.755
MEANT TO IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES.

00:59:18.821 --> 00:59:20.390
AND LASTLY TO SHOW THAT WE'RE

00:59:20.456 --> 00:59:21.624
NOT ABOUT THE MONEY. IF THE

00:59:21.691 --> 00:59:23.660
SPEEDING IN THE AREA DOES NOT GO

00:59:23.726 --> 00:59:25.361
DOWN IN OTHER WORDS IF THE

00:59:25.428 --> 00:59:26.429
AMOUNT OF TICKETS THE CAMERA

00:59:26.496 --> 00:59:28.031
GENERATES DOES NOT GO DOWN. THE

00:59:28.097 --> 00:59:30.600

00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:33.169
THESE ARE CLEARLY USED AS A

00:59:33.236 --> 00:59:34.637

YOU VERY MUCH OF CHAIR OF MY

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:22.798
QUESTIONS FOR THE WITNESS IN IN

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:24.867
IN OPPOSITION- YOU POINTED OUT

01:13:24.933 --> 01:13:26.401
THAT BOTH THE CAMERAS HAVE A

01:13:26.468 --> 01:13:28.303
COST IN THE ROAD IMPROVEMENTS

01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:30.439
THAT YOU REFER TO AS A SOLUTION

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:32.274
A PROBLEM HAVE A COST. BUT IT

01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:33.375
SEEMS THAT THE ROAD IMPROVEMENTS

01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:35.711
ARE MUCH MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE FOR

01:13:35.778 --> 01:13:37.379
THE PUTTING IN MORE ROUNDABOUTS

01:13:37.446 --> 01:13:40.449
ETCETERA- THEN THE VICTIM THE

01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:46.155
CAMERA- SET UP- AND I. WE HAVE

01:13:46.221 --> 01:13:47.556
TO TWO FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS DO

01:13:47.623 --> 01:13:50.058
YOU THINK THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH-

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:51.426
ROAD IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE COULD

01:13:51.493 --> 01:13:53.962
MAKE THAT WOULD ACTUALLY REDUCE

01:13:54.029 --> 01:13:56.965
THE AMOUNT OF SPEEDING. IT TEARS

01:13:57.032 --> 01:13:59.201
UP TO THE LEVEL THAT WE HAD A

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:01.203
SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE NUMBER

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:04.006
OF PEDESTRIAN DEATHS. BUT REALLY

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:06.475
IS- I WOULD LOVE TO GET AN

01:14:06.542 --> 01:14:07.643
ANSWER BUT IT'S ACTUALLY YOUR

01:14:07.709 --> 01:14:09.845
CALL IS A LEGISLATOR YOU GOT TO

01:14:09.912 --> 01:14:11.079
DETERMINE HOW WE SPEND MONEY AS

01:14:11.146 --> 01:14:13.749
A STATE JUST LIKE THE LOCAL-

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:15.717
ELECTED WOULD HAVE DETERMINATION

01:14:15.784 --> 01:14:16.485
OVER HOW THEY SPEND MONEY IN

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:18.987
THEIR BUDGET. AND SO IT'S REALLY

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:21.890
IT'S NOT MY CALL TO MAKE OF

01:14:21.957 --> 01:14:22.991
WHETHER WE INVEST ENOUGH BUT I

01:14:23.058 --> 01:14:24.626
DO THINK THAT. IF THE-

01:14:24.693 --> 01:14:26.862
COMMITMENT WAS THERE TO INVEST

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:27.996
THE MONEY THAT YES IT IS

01:14:28.063 --> 01:14:30.799
POSSIBLE. TO BUILD THE ROADS AND

01:14:30.866 --> 01:14:32.634
IMPROVE THE ROADS SAID THAT

01:14:32.701 --> 01:14:34.536
SPEEDING IS NOT THERE BUT IT

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:36.572
WOULD BE MISSED. SUBSTANTIAL

01:14:36.638 --> 01:14:38.874
REDUCTION IN DEATHS. AFTER AND

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:40.008
THEN MY OTHER QUESTION FOR YOU

01:14:40.075 --> 01:14:43.579
YOUR- ORIGINAL STATEMENT WAS. OF

01:14:43.645 --> 01:14:44.646
THE NUMBER OF DEATHS DON'T JUST.

01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:48.750
HEY THIS. IN A PRIVACY- THE THAT

01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:50.619
YOU SEE WITH THIS AND- IS THERE

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:52.688
A LEVEL OF DEBT NUMBER OF DEATHS

01:14:52.754 --> 01:14:54.823
THAT DOES JUSTIFY. THE THAT

01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:57.593
INVASION. WHAT WOULD IT BE IS-

01:14:57.659 --> 01:14:59.661
IS IT IF IT WAS FIVE TIMES WORSE

01:14:59.728 --> 01:15:01.430
WITH THAT JUSTIFY. THAT WAS NOT

01:15:01.496 --> 01:15:03.198
ACTUALLY WHAT MY STATEMENT WAS

01:15:03.265 --> 01:15:04.766
MY STATEMENT WAS THAT THERE ARE

01:15:04.833 --> 01:15:07.202
OTHER METHODS TO GET TO THE

01:15:07.269 --> 01:15:09.171
POINT OF REDUCING DEATHS. THAT

01:15:09.238 --> 01:15:11.340
DON'T HAVE THE SAME PRIVACY AND

01:15:11.406 --> 01:15:12.941
EQUITY CONCERNS AND THAT THOSE

01:15:13.008 --> 01:15:16.879
ARE WHAT THE LEGISLATURE. SHOULD

01:15:16.945 --> 01:15:18.614
BE PURSUING THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:22.751
. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. THANK YOU AND

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:24.419
I WANNA AND COMMEND THE ALL FOR

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:26.121
HARD WORK ON THIS I THINK YOU

01:15:26.188 --> 01:15:27.956
CAN SEE IN THE LEGISLATION THAT

01:15:28.023 --> 01:15:28.790
SHE HAS SPENT SIGNIFICANT TIME

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:30.592
AND ENERGY MAKING SURE BELL A

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:32.160
NARROW IN ITS SCOPE BASED ON

01:15:32.227 --> 01:15:33.528
COMMUNITIES DISADVANTAGED

01:15:33.595 --> 01:15:34.263
COMMUNITIES NOT TARGETING THAT

01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:36.164
MAKES THAT ARE AT SO I GUESS

01:15:36.231 --> 01:15:37.799
GIVEN THE HARD WORK SHE'S DONE

01:15:37.866 --> 01:15:40.002
TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE

01:15:40.068 --> 01:15:40.535
HOPEFULLY EVERYBODY COULD

01:15:40.602 --> 01:15:41.770
SUPPORT IT- YOU ARE BALANCING

01:15:41.837 --> 01:15:43.272
THE PRIVACY INTEREST WITH I WAS

01:15:43.338 --> 01:15:46.475
BEING SAVED- I'M CURIOUS WHAT.

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:49.311
WHAT WOULD GET YOU TO THAT POINT

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:52.080
OR NOTHING I MEAN YOU JUST

01:15:52.147 --> 01:15:54.616
AGAINST ALL CAMERAS. I'M WE

01:15:54.683 --> 01:15:56.618
WOULD AT THE VERY LEAST NEED TO

01:15:56.685 --> 01:15:58.987
SEE IF OTHER METHODS EXPLORED

01:15:59.054 --> 01:16:00.188
THAT ARE NOT INCREASING

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:01.523
SURVEILLANCE BECAUSE WE KNOW

01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:04.192
THAT SURVEILLANCE COMES WITH ITS

01:16:04.259 --> 01:16:05.894
OWN SITE IS STILL VERY POPULAR

01:16:05.961 --> 01:16:08.630
TRYING. WHAT IS OUT THERE DOING

01:16:08.697 --> 01:16:15.938
A GREAT. GOING OVER YOUR- YEAH-

01:16:16.004 --> 01:16:17.306
BUT THAT THEY SURVEILLANCE COME

01:16:17.372 --> 01:16:19.608
WITH ITS OWN AND COSTS AS WELL.

01:16:19.675 --> 01:16:21.443
AS SO SHE NOT BE THE FIRST

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:23.211
PROPOSED SOLUTION THE OTHER

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:25.781
SOLUTIONS SHOULD BE EXAMINED

01:16:25.847 --> 01:16:27.015
ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE OTHER

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:30.185
VERY CLEAR SOLUTIONS THAT ARE

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:31.386
OUT THERE. THANK YOU ONE I KNOW

01:16:31.453 --> 01:16:32.621
IS CHAIR OF THIS POSITION

01:16:32.688 --> 01:16:33.989
COMMITTEE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT

01:16:34.056 --> 01:16:35.457
THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER IT'S BEEN

01:16:35.524 --> 01:16:36.625
INCREDIBLY FOCUSED ON IN THIS

01:16:36.692 --> 01:16:38.360
ISN'T THE ONLY MEANS SHE HAS

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:39.795
USED TO REDUCE DEATHS AND

01:16:39.861 --> 01:16:41.730
PROTECT LIVES AND COMMUNITIES-

01:16:41.797 --> 01:16:43.565
AND SO I THINK THIS IS A

01:16:43.632 --> 01:16:45.600
COMMITTEE HAVING SAT ON IT FOR

01:16:45.667 --> 01:16:46.601
YEARS. IT REALLY DOES VALUE THE

01:16:46.668 --> 01:16:48.737
PRIVACY OF OUR TEAM MEMBERS AND

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:50.672
AS I YOU KNOW LOOK AT THIS BILL

01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:54.643
AND THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAW THE

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:56.278
WAY IN WHICH SHE NARROWED THE

01:16:56.345 --> 01:16:58.113
RETENTION OF THE DATA THE DATA

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.681
THAT WAS BEING- I THINK SHE HAS

01:16:59.748 --> 01:17:00.916
DONE A GOOD JOB IN NARROWING-

01:17:00.983 --> 01:17:02.451
THE PRIVACY THAT IS BEING GIVEN

01:17:02.517 --> 01:17:04.486
UP HERE TO SAVE LIVES AND SO I

01:17:04.553 --> 01:17:05.554
REALLY WOULD URGE THE ACLU THAT

01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:08.090
IF THERE IS ADDITIONAL WAYS IN

01:17:08.156 --> 01:17:11.660
WHICH WE CAN PROTECT THE PRIVACY

01:17:11.727 --> 01:17:13.061
TO BRING THAT TO THE SOME

01:17:13.128 --> 01:17:15.063
AMERICANS I THINK HER. INTEREST

01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:15.931
IN DOING SO. IN THE CLEAR IN

01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:16.932
THE- NATION STANDS TODAY BECAUSE

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:18.734
I THINK WE DO HAVE TO. INTEREST

01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:20.268
BUT THE INTEREST AS SAWYER

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:21.236
BENNETT POINTED OUT OF SAVING

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:23.605
LIVES IS PARAMOUNT AND SO I'LL

01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:26.108
BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT. THANK

01:17:26.174 --> 01:17:28.043

CONCERNS ME THAT AND I FEEL LIKE

01:19:04.439 --> 01:19:06.341
THERE COULD BE SOME MORE WORK IN

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:08.009
THIS AREA TO ENSURE THAT OUR

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:47.549
SIGNIFICANT THING THE DATA

THAT'S RETAIN HAS TO BE EXPUNGED

01:19:49.818 --> 01:19:51.486

DATA THAT STORY INDEFINITELY.

01:19:59.928 --> 01:20:01.396
AND AS LONG AS THEY'RE FOLLOWING

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:02.964
THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL

MODEL COLOR OF YOUR VEHICLE AND

01:20:11.773 --> 01:20:12.641
YOUR VEHICLE LICENSE PLATE

01:20:12.707 --> 01:20:14.009
BECAUSE YOU DRIVE AROUND AND

01:20:14.075 --> 01:20:14.809
EVERYWHERE ANYBODY WANTS COULD

01:20:14.876 --> 01:20:17.145
TAKE A PICTURE OF YOU DRIVING IN

01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:18.246
THE CAR THERE REALLY ISN'T MUCH

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:20.982
TO DO ABOUT THAT. SO WHAT WHERE

01:20:21.049 --> 01:20:22.951
IS THE INVASION OF PRIVACY IS

01:20:23.018 --> 01:20:25.754

BUT IT IS ALSO NOT THE SOLE

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:34.496
CONCERN I KNOWS THE- PURVIEW OF

01:20:34.563 --> 01:20:37.065
THIS COMMITTEE BUT WE ALSO HAVE.

01:20:37.132 --> 01:20:38.200
TO PROCESS AN EQUITY CONCERNS AS

WELL OUR PRIVACY CONCERNS THERE

01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:42.871

01:20:42.938 --> 01:20:43.705
THAT YOU'RE INCREASING

01:20:43.772 --> 01:20:47.075
SURVEILLANCE YOU THAT IS. THEY

01:20:47.142 --> 01:20:49.144
CALL THE IMPACTS PRIVACY AND

01:20:49.211 --> 01:20:51.246
PROBLEMATIC WAYS THESE CAMERAS

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:53.315
WILL ALSO NOT JUST BE CAPTURING.

01:20:53.381 --> 01:20:55.350
YOUR LICENSE PLATE INFORMATION

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:04.859
WHERE YOU WERE AT A PARTICULAR

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:07.862
MOMENT IN TIME- AND DEPENDING ON

01:21:07.929 --> 01:21:09.931
WHERE THESE CAMERAS ARE SET UP

01:21:09.998 --> 01:21:12.000
THAT COULD REVEAL VERY SENSITIVE

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:15.470
INFORMATION ABOUT YOU BUT AT THE

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:17.772
VERY LEAST COULD REVEAL. YOUR

TRAVEL AND FOR ME. THAT EVENT

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:20.475
PERSONAL INFORMATION- SO THERE

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:22.644
IS A LOT WE ALSO OFTENTIMES SEE

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:25.347
THAT NO MATTER HOW TIGHTLY THE

01:21:25.413 --> 01:21:28.483
PROTECTIONS ARE. THAT ARE PUT IN

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:29.985
PLACE TO TRY AND PROTECT DATA

THAT DATA IS FREQUENTLY STILL.

01:21:33.822 --> 01:21:35.690

SHARED AND APPROPRIATELY AND WE

01:21:37.993 --> 01:21:39.894
CAUGHT MISSION CREEP AND THAT'S

01:21:39.961 --> 01:21:41.029
ANOTHER CONCERN HERE THAT WE

01:21:41.096 --> 01:21:43.431
HAVE SEEN MANY TIMES WHERE THERE

01:21:43.498 --> 01:21:46.101

01:21:47.068 --> 01:21:48.470
WHEN IT CAN'T GOING BACK TO THE

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:50.338
PREVIOUS BELL THAT WAS UP IN

01:21:50.405 --> 01:21:52.374
COMMITTEE FOR EXAMPLE ON ALE PR

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.476
INFORMATION THE LAW IS REALLY

01:21:54.542 --> 01:21:56.077

CANNOT SHARE ALE PR INFORMATION

01:21:58.446 --> 01:22:01.116
OUT OF STATE. OR WITH THE FEDS

01:22:01.182 --> 01:22:02.784
AND YET WE'VE SEEN MANY LAW

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:04.386
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES DOING THAT

01:22:04.452 --> 01:22:06.121
JUST THAT I MEAN ACLU AND

01:22:06.187 --> 01:22:08.123
ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION

01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:09.891
FOR EXAMPLE ARE CURRENTLY

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.326
LITIGATING. WITH MARIN COUNTY

01:22:11.393 --> 01:22:13.161
SHERIFF OVER THAT EVEN WHEN WE

01:22:13.228 --> 01:22:15.930
DO SEE IT AS A REALLY IMPORTANT

01:22:15.997 --> 01:22:18.566
PROTECTIONS AND I DO WANT TO

01:22:18.633 --> 01:22:20.502

SOME OF THOSE- PROTECTIONS AND

01:22:29.044 --> 01:22:30.745
SO IT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO

01:22:30.812 --> 01:22:33.315
CONSIDERATION. THE IMPACTS THE

01:22:33.381 --> 01:22:37.886

NEW TO THE AREA OF ONLINE

01:34:37.438 --> 01:34:39.640
REGULATION THE FIRST IS THAT IT

01:34:39.707 --> 01:34:41.308
DEFINES A CHILD AS A PERSON

01:34:41.375 --> 01:34:44.512

01:35:06.233 --> 01:35:08.369
ACTIONS FROM YOUNG USES THIS IS

01:35:08.436 --> 01:35:10.671
A PARADIGM SHIFT TOWARDS PRODUCT

01:35:10.738 --> 01:35:13.107

POSTING PHOTOS OF MYSELF I STOP

01:39:14.882 --> 01:39:16.684
AT HORRIBLE WHENEVER I WAS.

01:39:16.750 --> 01:39:17.885
UPSET MEDIA PLATFORM SO I

01:39:17.951 --> 01:39:19.953
DELETED THE APPS OFF MY PHONE.

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:21.021
BUT I STARTED BEING EXCLUDED

01:39:21.088 --> 01:39:22.990
FROM CONVERSATIONS AT SCHOOL. I

01:39:23.057 --> 01:39:24.625
WAS MEASURING MYSELF UP TO ALL

01:39:24.692 --> 01:39:26.827
OF MY PEERS ON THESE PLATFORMS

01:39:26.894 --> 01:39:28.929
AND I FELT LIKE I WAS LOSING. MY

01:39:28.996 --> 01:39:33.967
KNOW. THE DESIGN PURGING PEOPLE

01:39:34.034 --> 01:39:35.669
GO. BACK TO THE TOP SO

01:39:35.736 --> 01:39:36.503
COMPARISON. AND THEY KNOW WHAT.

01:39:36.570 --> 01:39:38.505
PEOPLE AS A DID ME. IT MAKES ME.

01:39:38.572 --> 01:39:40.207
DIZZY AS IF NOT WELCOME ARE NOT

01:39:40.274 --> 01:39:42.176
NEEDED. AND TO THINK THAT THIS

01:39:42.242 --> 01:39:43.210
IS A DESIGN FEATURE ON THESE

01:39:43.277 --> 01:39:47.881
PLATFORMS IS SICKENING. THIS

01:39:47.948 --> 01:39:49.116
WASN'T SOMETHING I COULD TALK TO

01:39:49.183 --> 01:39:50.718
MY PARENTS ABOUT. DIDIT HAVE

01:39:50.784 --> 01:39:51.652
ANY SIMILAR EXPERIENCES ON

01:39:51.719 --> 01:39:54.321
SOCIAL MEDIA GROWING UP SO THEY

01:39:54.388 --> 01:39:56.023
DID NOT CATCH ME WHEN I FELL. I

01:39:56.090 --> 01:39:57.691
FOUND MYSELF IN A POSITION WITH

01:39:57.758 --> 01:39:59.360
NO SUPPORT. BECAUSE THERE WAS NO

01:39:59.426 --> 01:40:00.928
ONE TO HELP ME. SOCIAL MEDIA

01:40:00.994 --> 01:40:02.596
PLATFORMS FACILITATE THIS HARM

01:40:02.663 --> 01:40:04.832
AND THEY REFUSED TO TAKE

01:40:04.898 --> 01:40:05.866
RESPONSIBILITY. INSTEAD OF

01:40:05.933 --> 01:40:07.668
FOCUSING ON MY GRADES MY MENTAL

01:40:07.735 --> 01:40:09.303
AND MY PHYSICAL HEALTH MY

01:40:09.370 --> 01:40:10.738
ATTENTION WAS ON OTHER GIRLS ON

01:40:10.804 --> 01:40:12.873
THE INTERNET. I FIXATED ON

01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:14.975
TRYING TO BE LIKE THEM. I HATED

01:40:15.042 --> 01:40:17.745
BEING ME. IT WAS NO LONGER ABOUT

01:40:17.811 --> 01:40:19.613
FITTING IN WITH MY CLASSMATES IT

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:23.517
WAS A PLEASING SOMEONE. AND HE-

01:40:23.584 --> 01:40:25.219
IT WASN'T UNTIL THE POPE

01:40:25.285 --> 01:40:25.919
NINETEEN KNOCKED DOWN THAT I

01:40:25.986 --> 01:40:27.454

WORLD. AND IT IS- IT HAS A LOT

01:53:24.831 --> 01:53:26.799
OF CASE LAW BEHIND IT AND IT IS

01:53:26.866 --> 01:53:27.800
SOMETHING THAT THE COURTS

01:53:27.867 --> 01:53:30.703
UNDERSTAND AS BEING A BALANCING

01:53:30.770 --> 01:53:33.106
ACT SO IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION IN

FRONT OF YOU AND IS IT IN THE

01:53:36.943 --> 01:53:38.111
BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD TO DO

01:53:38.178 --> 01:53:39.779
ABLE. THE INTERESTING THING

ENGINEERS AND THAT LIKE THAT

01:53:44.817 --> 01:53:47.153
STANDARD IS THERE YOU KNOW ACT

01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:49.222
CAN YOU OPTIMIZE FOR STICKINESS

01:53:49.289 --> 01:53:52.025
IS THAT A OR B. AS A SIMILAR

01:53:52.091 --> 01:53:53.927
QUESTION FOR THEM AS- CAN YOU

01:53:53.993 --> 01:53:55.995
ACT IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF A

01:53:56.062 --> 01:53:59.165
CHILD A. B. I WOULD SAY. THAT

01:53:59.232 --> 01:54:00.700
SIDE OF THE US AND HAVE A GREAT

01:54:00.767 --> 01:54:02.769
DEAL OF CANCEL BUT THE WAY THAT

01:54:02.835 --> 01:54:05.004
USUALLY HERE THAT- THAT FREEZE

01:54:05.071 --> 01:54:06.706
USES YOU'RE DEALING WITH LIKE A

01:54:06.773 --> 01:54:09.075
JUDGE WHOSE- DISCERNING THAT

01:54:09.142 --> 01:54:10.910
AFFECT A PARTICULAR CHILD IN A

01:54:10.977 --> 01:54:12.812
PARTICULAR SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES

01:54:12.879 --> 01:54:13.980
HERE WE'RE GONNA HAVE A

01:54:14.047 --> 01:54:15.448
CORPORATION SOMEHOW MAKE THAT

01:54:15.515 --> 01:54:18.218
JUDGMENT WITH RESPECT TO ALL

01:54:18.284 --> 01:54:19.319
CHILDREN I MEAN HOW DO YOU EVEN

01:54:19.385 --> 01:54:20.653
AND THAT SORT OF ANALYSIS WHEN I

01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:22.589
THINK YOU SEE HOW THEY HAVE BEEN

01:54:22.655 --> 01:54:24.824
DONE SO FOR EXAMPLE THEY HAVE

01:54:24.891 --> 01:54:26.392
DECIDED IT IS NOT IN THE BEST

01:54:26.459 --> 01:54:27.527
INTEREST OF CHILDREN TO

01:54:27.594 --> 01:54:29.629
CONTINUE. IN TO OUR STRANGE

01:54:29.696 --> 01:54:32.832
HEALTH TO DIRECT MESSAGE. AT

01:54:32.899 --> 01:54:35.335
UNDER AGE CHILDREN AND THAT IS

01:54:35.401 --> 01:54:37.070
ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT'S COME

01:54:37.136 --> 01:54:39.105
OUT OF THIS OF WHACK OUT OF THE

01:54:39.172 --> 01:54:42.342
CODE AND I THINK THAT UNTIL IT

01:54:42.408 --> 01:54:44.143
WAS IN THE INBOX TO CONSIDER

01:54:44.210 --> 01:54:46.879
CHILDREN HOW WOULD YOU DO IT

01:54:46.946 --> 01:54:47.547
DIFFERENTLY IF YOU KNEW THE END

01:54:47.614 --> 01:54:50.283
USER WAS A CHILD THEY WENT

01:54:50.350 --> 01:54:52.018
HOSKING THE QUESTION. IS WERE

01:54:52.085 --> 01:54:59.659
COMPLETE AC THE MAPS YOU'RE NOT. TO MAKE A SYSTEM THAT IS IN

01:54:59.726 --> 01:55:02.095
THE BEST INTEREST. OF CHILDREN.

01:55:02.161 --> 01:55:03.363
OKAY THAT SO YOU SAYING THAT

01:55:03.429 --> 01:55:04.530
THIS THIS HAS ACTUALLY APPLIED

01:55:04.597 --> 01:55:06.633
IN THE IN THE WAY THAT IT'S

01:55:06.699 --> 01:55:07.734
BEING APPLIED HERE ANOTHER

01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:09.636
ANOTHER- JUDICIAL SYSTEMS.

01:55:09.702 --> 01:55:11.371
INDEED INDEED I'M NOT AND I'M%

01:55:11.437 --> 01:55:13.006
NOT GOING TO PRETEND TO YOU THAT

01:55:13.072 --> 01:55:15.141
EVERY AND THAT THERE IS A BRIGHT

01:55:15.208 --> 01:55:17.243
LINE. YOU KNOW BETWEEN THE EVERY

01:55:17.310 --> 01:55:19.345
SINGLE DECISION THAT THE IN THE

01:55:19.412 --> 01:55:21.281
THAT A COMPANY CAN MAKE BUT THAT

01:55:21.347 --> 01:55:24.150
ALREADY IS NOT A BRIGHT LINE OF

01:55:24.217 --> 01:55:25.485
THE DECISIONS THAT MAKING SO I

01:55:25.551 --> 01:55:27.754
THINK THAT. THAT THIS IS A

01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:30.490
INTENT ON THE PRINCIPLES THAT

01:55:30.556 --> 01:55:33.159
THAT CODE SET TOP TWO. YEAH A

01:55:33.226 --> 01:55:34.961
VERY CLEARLY INTENTIONAL AND IT

01:55:35.028 --> 01:55:37.063
GIVES A LOT OF SPACE TO THE

01:55:37.130 --> 01:55:38.064
TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES TO

01:55:38.131 --> 01:55:41.067
INTERPRET THEM. AND MEET THE

01:55:41.134 --> 01:55:43.403
BOMB AND- YOU KNOW THAT WOULD BE

01:55:43.469 --> 01:55:46.372
ACTUALLY LAID DOWN IN MORE

01:55:46.439 --> 01:55:47.940
DETAIL SO THERE ARE SOME SAFE

01:55:48.007 --> 01:55:48.675
HARBORS WERE. EXCELLENT AND Z.

01:55:48.741 --> 01:55:50.543
THEN YOU'RE- NOT SUBJECT TO

01:55:50.610 --> 01:55:52.211
LITIGATION BASED ON THE BEST

01:55:52.278 --> 01:55:55.581
INTEREST OF THE CHILD STANDARD.

01:55:55.648 --> 01:55:57.317
THERE IS NOT. A SERGEANT YEAH I

01:55:57.383 --> 01:55:58.518
WAS JUST TO JUMP INTO YOU DON'T

01:55:58.584 --> 01:56:00.687
MIND. I JUST I JUST ONE FOR

01:56:00.753 --> 01:56:01.988
FIRMEST HAS BEEN- THIS THIS

01:56:02.055 --> 01:56:04.657
NOTION. THE WAY ABOUT THE BEST

01:56:04.724 --> 01:56:06.025
INTERESTS AND WE'VE CHANGED IT.

01:56:06.092 --> 01:56:07.593
IF IN THE AMENDMENTS EVERY TAKE

01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:08.895
ON THIS COMMITTEE TOTHE BEST

01:56:08.961 --> 01:56:09.696
INTERESTS OF CHILDREN AND MOVED

01:56:09.762 --> 01:56:11.464
INTO FINDING SOME DECORATIONS.

01:56:11.531 --> 01:56:14.200
SO THIS IS THE INTENT OF THE

01:56:14.267 --> 01:56:15.134
LEGISLATURE. THAT AS AS FOLKS

01:56:15.201 --> 01:56:16.736
ARE THINK ABOUT THIS A CALL IF A

01:56:16.803 --> 01:56:17.370
CONFLICT ARISES BETWEEN

01:56:17.437 --> 01:56:18.671
COMMERCIAL INTERESTS AND THE

01:56:18.738 --> 01:56:19.939
BEST INTERESTS OF CHILDREN

01:56:20.006 --> 01:56:21.107
COMPANIES SHOULD PRIORITIZE THE

01:56:21.174 --> 01:56:23.142
PRIVACY SAFETY. AND WELL BEING

01:56:23.209 --> 01:56:23.710
OF CHILDREN OVER COMMERCIAL

01:56:23.776 --> 01:56:25.611
INTERESTS THAT HAS BEEN MOVED

01:56:25.678 --> 01:56:26.846
INTO THE- SECTION THE FINDINGS

01:56:26.913 --> 01:56:29.015
OF DECORATION THE BEGINNING OF

01:56:29.082 --> 01:56:30.817
THE BILL. OKAY SO YOU'RE SAYING

01:56:30.883 --> 01:56:32.352
THAT THE AYE AYES ADS RIGHT NOW

01:56:32.418 --> 01:56:34.654
THAT WOULD NOT BE THE STANDARD

01:56:34.721 --> 01:56:35.755
ACCORDING WHICH LIABILITIES IF

01:56:35.822 --> 01:56:37.890
YOU COULD. WHAT CORRECT ALTHOUGH

01:56:37.957 --> 01:56:39.759
WE I WILL SAY NO A RESERVE THIS

01:56:39.826 --> 01:56:42.095
FOR MY TIME WHEN I SPEAK THERE I

01:56:42.161 --> 01:56:43.396
THINK WE DO NEED TO THERE NEED

01:56:43.463 --> 01:56:44.630
TO BE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THE

01:56:44.697 --> 01:56:46.366
REMEDY ISSUE I THINK ALL PARTIES

01:56:46.432 --> 01:56:47.700
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT- AND I THINK

01:56:47.767 --> 01:56:48.835
IT'S SUBJECT TO CONTINUING

01:56:48.901 --> 01:56:50.103
CONVERSATIONS BUT FOR RIGHT NOW

01:56:50.169 --> 01:56:51.337
THIS IS NOT THIS IS NOT

01:56:51.404 --> 01:56:52.772
OPERATIVE STATUTORY LANGUAGE ON

01:56:52.839 --> 01:56:54.607
WHICH A LIABILITY WOULD ATTACK.

01:56:54.674 --> 01:56:56.342
OKAY THAT'S GOOD I MEAN IT JUST

01:56:56.409 --> 01:56:57.944

DEBATES SORT OF YOU KNOW WITH

01:57:00.113 --> 01:57:00.780
SOME TRYING TO HAVE THE

01:57:00.847 --> 01:57:02.849
GOVERNMENT PLAY A ROLE IN THIS

01:57:02.915 --> 01:57:04.016
AND WHAT'S BEST FOR KIDS WHILE

01:57:04.083 --> 01:57:05.918
OTHERS YOU KNOW I'D BE ON THIS I

01:57:05.985 --> 01:57:06.819
GENERALLY SAY THEY SHOULD BE

01:57:06.886 --> 01:57:08.855
LEFT TO FAMILIES SEEMS LIKE

01:57:08.921 --> 01:57:09.756
HAVING THE CORPORATION MAKE THE

DECISIONS HAVE THE WORST OF ALL

01:57:12.024 --> 01:57:12.759

THEY'RE ASKING YOU TO DO IS JAM

03:29:05.566 --> 03:29:07.468
A BUILD ON THE CONSUMERS SO THAT

THEY DON'T WANT TO. HEAR THE

03:29:09.904 --> 03:29:11.238
GROUP. THE BILL. IN AMERICAN

COALITION. CIAU LUWAK. THESE ARE

03:29:20.014 --> 03:29:21.649
ALL OPPOSED TO THIS CONSUMER

03:29:21.715 --> 03:29:23.918
FRIENDLY BILL. THIS BILL DOES

03:29:23.984 --> 03:29:28.055
NOT DO WHAT IT SAYS WHAT. WOULD

03:29:28.122 --> 03:29:30.524
THEY TELL YOU IT DOES IT DOESN'T

03:29:30.591 --> 03:29:32.960
IT. FIFTEEN PAGE BILL BUT ONE OF

03:29:33.027 --> 03:29:34.461
THE MOST CONCERNING THAT THE

03:29:34.528 --> 03:29:36.797
PROMOTING IS. THE CONSUMER OR

03:29:36.864 --> 03:29:38.532
THE CSO IS SUPPOSED TO INDICATE

03:29:38.599 --> 03:29:41.201
WHICH ITEMS ARE TO BE REMOVED OR

03:29:41.268 --> 03:29:43.003
CHALLENGED. THAT IS NOT AT ALL.

03:29:43.070 --> 03:29:45.372
THE BURDEN OF THE CONSUMER THIS

03:29:45.439 --> 03:29:47.708
YET SO. IF YOU HAVE THE POWER TO

03:29:47.775 --> 03:29:49.576
RUIN SOME. HE SHOULD HAVE THE

03:29:49.643 --> 03:29:50.811
POWER TO JUSTIFY WHY YOU'RE

03:29:50.878 --> 03:29:52.279
DOING. SO FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES

03:29:52.346 --> 03:29:53.814
THAT WHEN A CONSUMER CHALLENGES

03:29:53.881 --> 03:29:55.549
SOMETHING OR ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT

03:29:55.616 --> 03:29:57.017
HIS OR HER CREDIT. IT'S THE

03:29:57.084 --> 03:29:59.086
FURNITURE THAT COLLECTED AT

03:29:59.153 --> 03:30:00.854
SUPPOSED TO JUSTIFY WHY THAT

03:30:00.921 --> 03:30:02.623
CREDIT REPORT. THE WAY THAT THE

03:30:02.690 --> 03:30:05.459
US WHAT THIS BILL IT WAS NOW

03:30:05.526 --> 03:30:06.927
CONSUMER SUPPOSED TO SAY. THIS

03:30:06.994 --> 03:30:08.429
IS NOT MINE THIS IS NOT MINE

03:30:08.495 --> 03:30:09.730
THIS IS NOT MINE THE PROBLEM

03:30:09.797 --> 03:30:11.999
WITH THAT IS OFTENTIMES

03:30:12.066 --> 03:30:14.101
BECKETT'S BOUGHT ANY CHANGES

03:30:14.168 --> 03:30:15.803

03:30:15.869 --> 03:30:17.738
YEARS AGO. ABOUT YOUR- YOU KNOW

03:30:17.805 --> 03:30:19.707
HAVE A REALLY LONG FOR CAPITAL

03:30:19.773 --> 03:30:21.175
YOU CAN'T SAY AWKWARD. I ON'T

03:30:21.241 --> 03:30:22.343
HAVE THIS DEBT THIS ISN'T MINE

03:30:22.409 --> 03:30:24.912
THEY WOULD KNOW. SO BY IF THIS

03:30:24.979 --> 03:30:26.413
BILL PASSES NOW THAT CONSUMERS

03:30:26.480 --> 03:30:27.915
SUPPOSED TO KNOW EVERYTHING

03:30:27.982 --> 03:30:29.750
THAT'S ON THE CREDIT REPORT AND

03:30:29.817 --> 03:30:30.985
THAT'S SIMPLY UNFAIR. FEDERAL

03:30:31.051 --> 03:30:33.487
LAW REQUIRES THAT SOMEBODY WHO

03:30:33.554 --> 03:30:34.922
REALLY EMBODIES CREDIT OR

03:30:34.989 --> 03:30:37.725
PROVIDE THAT ROUTE CRAP HAPPENS

03:30:37.791 --> 03:30:39.193
BY WHAT DOING. AND THIS WOULD

03:30:39.259 --> 03:30:41.195
PUT THAT ON ITS THAT'S A

03:30:41.261 --> 03:30:42.563
PROBLEM. IT'S A REAL PROBLEM

03:30:42.629 --> 03:30:45.466
CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA. THE

03:30:45.532 --> 03:30:48.035
OTHER ISSUE IS I KNOW A LOT OF

YOU CARE. VERY DEEPLY ABOUT FOR

03:30:50.237 --> 03:30:51.438
HOUSING. VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN

03:30:51.505 --> 03:30:52.773
THE STATE. CREDIT IS A HUGE AND
