GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT TO YOU THIS MORNING AB TWENTY THREE ZERO FIVE WHICH WILL ESTABLISH A COORDINATED HOUSING FINANCE COMMITTEE TO ALLOCATE STATE CAN. ROUTE SOURCE FOR AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING CALIFORNIA'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE SYSTEM IS COMPRISED OF FOUR SEPARATE ENTITIES WHICH ADMINISTER A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES INCLUDING LOANS TAX CREDITS TAX EXEMPT BONDS TO HOUSING DEVELOPERS WHO BUILD AND RITA. A FULL. LOWER INCOME HI. INTRO TWENTY THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT THE LACK OF COORDINATION AMONG THESE ENTITIES HAS REDUCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO OUR HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS. DEVELOPERS THEY WERE INTERVIEWED FOR THE AUDIT EXPRESS THE NEED FOR A SYSTEM THAT CONSOLIDATES AND COORDINATES MULTIPLE HOUSING RESOURCES INTO ONE CENTRALIZED PROCESS THE REPORT CONCLUDED THAT A STANDARD SET OF REQUIREMENTS. CONSISTENT DEADLINES AND A SINGLE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAMS WOULD NOT ONLY REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF DELAYS FOR APPLICANTS BUT IT WOULD ALSO BUT IT COULD ALSO INCREASE THE STATE'S SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE FINDINGS OF THE STATE AUDITOR HAVE SINCE. BEEN ECHOED IN NUMEROUS DIFFERENT. JUST THIS VERY MONTH THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION RELEASED A REPORT ON BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION WHICH FOUND THE CURRENT ARRANGEMENT QUOTE. IS INEFFICIENT RESULTING IN CONFUSION OVER RESPONSIBILITIES SERVICE GAPS AND A DISCONNECT BETWEEN STATE GOALS AND POLICIES ACT'S TWENTY TWENTY TWO STATEWIDE HOUSING PLANNED. THAT QUOTE THE BACKLOG OF PROJECTS THAT APPLIED FOR DID NOT RECEIVE PUBLIC FINANCING ASSISTANCE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS SHOWS US THAT WE MUST CAREFULLY MANAGE AFFORDABLE HOUSING INVESTMENTS. AND THAT THERE ARE PROBLEMATIC AREAS WITHIN HOUSING FINANCES. LAST FALL I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF EMBARKING HONEST WIDE HOUSING COMMITTEE AS A MATTER OF FACT THAT ALMOST EVERY STOP ON THE TOUR WE HEARD FROM AFFORDABLE DEVELOPERS THAT THE LACK OF COORDINATION BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. THE CALIFORNIA TAX OKAY MAYBE THE CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE AND THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY WAS A SERIOUS IMPEDIMENT TO THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN TO THE FOR WHAT WAS ON NEED FOR REFORM I HAVE INTRODUCED AB TWENTY THREE IS FIVE. THIS BILL WILL CREATE ORDER HOUSING FOR COMMITTEE WHICH WILL ALLOCATE STATE CONTROLLED RESOURCES FOR THE FINANCE OF AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING THROUGH A SINGLE PROCESS AN APPLICANT TO OBTAIN ALL NECESSARY SYSTEM AT ONE. WITH A APPLICATION IMPORTANTLY THE CREATION OF THE COMMITTEE WILL NOT ALTER OR TRANSFER ANY OF THE AUTHORITIES CURRENTLY ENJOYED BY THE FOR AGENCIES AND TO CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS WHO OVERSEE AFFORDABLE HOUSING POLICY THAT IS IN THE STATE. RATHER THE COMMITTEE WILL PROVIDE A FOCAL POINT FOR CONVERSATION AND COORDINATION AMONG THE VARIOUS ACTORS TO PARAPHRASE THE LATE WHO COMMISSIONS RATIONALE REFORM MY GOAL IS NOT TO CRITIQUE THE RELAY. BUT THE GOVERNOR AND THE STE TRY. IT SIMPLY WILL PROVE ON A DRUG BURKE IS CALL. BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCE. AS THE COME AS RIGHT.

TO MEET OUR ASPIRATION TO ADDRESS ALL OF OUR FORD WILL HOUSING NEEDS HERE IN CALIFORNIA NO ANSWER CONTROLLER I DO SERVICE BOARD MEMBER OF THE TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THE CALIFORNIA DEBT LIMIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE. HAVE SEEN FIRST HAND HOW WE ARE IN OUR OWN WAY WHEN IT COMES TO FUNDING AND BUILDING DESPERATELY NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN OUR STATE.

THIS DISJOINTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE STRUCTURE AS AN IMPEDIMENT TO MEETING THE STATE'S HOUSING SUPPLY GOALS.

AND I WOULD ALSO DO OR SAY A GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY. IN TWENTY. THE SUPPLY PRIVATE ACTIVITY BOND WERE PROCESS BECAME OVERSUBSCRIBED. WE BETTER COORDINATE OUR PROGRAMS TO MAKE THE MOST OF OUR LIMITED HOUSING OF SOURCES. MANY PROJECTS THAT HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING YOU SEE IF YOU THE FEW SEVEN OPEN OLD. US ARE STILL WAY ON SOME.

OF THE WINNIPEG TOWARDS THE DEMANDS OF THAT IS REQUIRED IN CALIFORNIA TO MEET ALL OF OUR NEEDS WE ARE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE- SO. WE HAVE- MAKE CRITICAL INVESTMENTS IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS BUT WITHOUT A MORE EFFICIENT ALLOCATION SYSTEM MUCH OF THIS THE FUNDING IS WASTED THREE DELAYS AND UNNECESSARY BUREAUCRACY.

GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES TODAY I PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT WHICH EXTENDS EXISTING EXPECTATIONS AND CODE ENFORCEMENT TO BUILDING USED FOR HUMAN HABITATION REGARDLESS OF ZONING AND IMPROVES TENANT PROTECTIONS WHEN BUILDINGS ARE DEEMED UNSAFE. CURRENT LAW PROVIDES THAT IF ANY DWELLING NOT UP TO STANDARDS. AND PUTS THE RESIDENT OR THE PUBLIC IN HARM'S WAY MUST COMPLY WITH CODE INSPECTIONS HOWEVER THERE IS AMBIGUITY IN THE LAW WHETHER THESE PROTECTIONS APPLY TO BUILDINGS NOT RESIDENTIALLY ZONED EVEN IF THEY ARE BEING INHABITED. AS WE KNOW SADLY THERE HAVE BEEN SOME DIRE CONSEQUENCES WITH PEOPLE LIVING AND BUILDINGS MAYBE NOT LEGALLY BUT THAT WERE NOT UP TO CODE AND HAVE ACTUALLY DIED. STE SUBSTANDARD CONDITIONS AND ASSOCIATED DANGERS DO NOT CEASE TO EXIST JUST BECAUSE OF ZONING FOR THE PAST DECADE CALIFORNIA HAS AND CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE A HOUSING SHORTAGE OF SIGNIFICANT PROPORTIONS PARTICULARLY IN THE FOR DOUBLE HOUSING SECTOR AND THE HOMELESS POPULATION HAS ALMOST DOUBLED SINCE THE PANDEMIC. INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO ARE UNABLE TO FIND AVAILABLE BEDS IN HOMELESS SHELTERS ARE SEEKING SHELTER FROM THE STREETS AND TAKING UP RESIDENCE AND BUILDINGS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ZONED RESIDENTIAL WHERE BOTH WAREHOUSES AND FACTORY SPACES ARE BEING CONVERTED TO RESIDENTIAL USE WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF LOCAL OFFICIALS AND WITHOUT THE BUILDING BEING HABITABLE DESPITE MANY PAIN THE OWNER RENT MANY WHO ARE PAYING THE OWNER TO RENT THE SPACE. MANY OF THESE WAREHOUSES FACTORIES AND BUILDINGS ARE NOT IN RESIDENTIAL ZONES AND THEREFORE HAVE EVADED MUCH NEEDED INSPECTION. IN DECEMBER TWENTY SIXTEEN AS I MENTIONED DEADLY FIRE IN OAKLAND WHERE HOUSE KNOWN AS THE GO SHIP THAT KILLED THIRTY SIX PEOPLE. THE HIGHEST DEATH TOLL FOR STRUCTURAL FIRE IN THE UNITED STATES IN OVER A DECADE. GO SHIP WAS A TWO STORY WAREHOUSETHAT WAS ILLEGALLY BEING LEASED TO ARTISTS WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THE BUILDING AND PERIODICALLY USING IT FOR EVEN. ZONED AS A WAREHOUSE NEITHER RESIDENTIAL NOR ASSEMBLY USES WERE PERMITTED BY THE CITY AND THE BUILDING WAS NOT DESIGNED OR BUILT FOR HUMAN HABITATION. UNFORTUNATELY THIS TRAGEDY IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT UNHEALTHY HOUSING HAS SERVED AS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS FOR TOO LONG. WHAT I'LL JUST ADD TO THIS IS THIS IS GOING TO INCREASE AS WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY MANY PEOPLE SEEKING HOUSING THERE ARE MANY. INDIVIDUALS THAT MAY OWN OR OPERATE THESE BUILDINGS AND ARE LOOKING FOR CREATIVE WAYS TO GET PEOPLE HOUSE SO WITH THAT I HAVE WITH ME MISTER MISTER MATTHEW SILVA WHO IS THE CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE COMMUTE BUT- COMMITTEE OF CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. AND THE SPONSOR OF AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX AND MISTER EDUARDO TORRES CALIFORNIA REGIONAL COORDINATOR FOR TENANTS TOGETHER HERE. TO SPEAK IN BEHALF OF THIS BILL. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS A LOT OF A TAURUS I AM THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL COORDINATOR FOR TENANTS TOGETHER A STATEWIDE COALITION OF MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS THAT IS DEDICATED TO DEFENDING AND ADVANCING RIGHTS OF CALIFORNIA TENANTS TO SAFE. AND DECENT AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING- TODAY TO GET MY TESTIMONY ABOUT SOME OF THE CONDITIONS THAT RENTERS ACROSS THE STATE FACED WHILE LIVING IN SLUMBER CONDITIONS. AS A REGIONAL COORDINATOR I HAVE WITNESSED SLUMLORDS OPERATE UNSAFE RENTALS WITHOUT ANY CONSEQUENCES. I WANT TO SHARE A QUICK STORY THOUGH ABOUT A BUILDING WHERE THE SLUM LORD DESPITE MULTIPLE CODE VIOLATIONS AND FORCE ACT MIGHT MULTIPLE CODE VIOLATION FOR SPENCE- REFUSED TO FIX HABITABILITY PROBLEMS. IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY THE TENANTS AT GLENBROOK GREEN WERE UNDER THE MERCY OF AN OWNER WHO WOULD NOT MAKE ANY REPAIRS THE TENANTS LIVE WITH MOLD BED BUGS COCKROACHES. HOLES IN THE ROOF BAD PLUMBING BROKEN HEATERS HOLES ON THE FLOOR BROKEN WINDOWS AND BROKEN SMOKE ALARMS REPAIRS HAVE BEEN MET WITH THREATS OF DISPLACEMENT. EVENTUALLY CODE ENFORCEMENT CITED THE OWNER FROM MULTIPLE CODE VIOLATIONS BUT AT THE END NOTHING HAS CHANGED AND TENANTS ARE STILL FORCED TO LIVE IN UNSAFE HOMES. STORIES LIKE THESE UNFORTUNATELY ARE VERY UNCOMMON IN CALIFORNIA CHILDREN ARE FORCED TO LIVE WITH BED BUGS PEOPLE ARE WITH RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS ARE FORCED TO LIVE WITH MOLD. FAMILIES ARE FORCED TO LIVE WITH COCKROACH AND RAT INFESTATIONS. THIS IS WHY AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR CALIFORNIA RENTERS. RECEIVERSHIP TAKE AWAY THESE INHABITABLE BUILDINGS. ARE FROM A RESPONSIBLE PROPERTY OWNERS WHO HAVE NOT INVESTCORP NOT INVESTED INTO RENTALS. CURRENTLY SLUMLORDS HAVE BENEFITTED FROM NOT PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE OF RELOCATION FEES THIS BILL IS MAKING SURE THAT RENTERS SAFETY IS PROTECTED SO THAT SO THEY DON'T BECOME HOUSELESS. THE CURRENT LAW IS INADEQUATE AND PUTS RENTERS WE'RE AT RISK. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY FOR RENTERS IF THEY ARE FORCED TO MOVE FIFTY SIX DOLLARS A DAY IS NOT ENOUGH. BUT NOW WILL HAVE A SOLUTIONS TO GET TO HELP. THIS BILL GIVES JUDGES A SOLUTION TO MAKE SURE THAT THE REMEDY IS ADEQUATE AND FAIR. THIS BILL ADDRESS A SERIOUS HEALTH CODE VIOLATIONS WHERE IT'S NOT SAFE FOR RENTERS TO BE PRESIDENT. WE DON'T WANT THE STATE TO SUBSTITUTE UNSAFE HOUSING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THANK YOU. BOARDING MY NAME IS MATTHEW SILVER IN FIRST OF ALL I LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU- SECONDLY I AM A CERTIFIED CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IN THE CHAIR OF THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE FOR THE TOP FORTIES. TEACHING A CODE ENFORCER LOBSTERS. VERY BRIEFLY A CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS- COULD FORCE OFFICERS ARE THE FRONT LINE IN ENFORCING A BUILDING CODES AND HOUSING CODES IN OUR CALIFORNIA IN OUR CALIFORNIA A STATE. WE DEAL WITH A WHOLE LITANY OF QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUES AND WE ARE OFTEN THE ONLY ONES IN FORCING THESE. SO DEALING WITH HOUSING ISSUES IN PARTICULAR SUB STANDARD HOUSING IS PART OF OUR EVERYDAY JOB. ACCORDING TO THE U. THAT U. S. CENSUS BUREAU OVER TWO MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE LIVING IN SUBSTANDARD HOUSING IN THE STATE. ALONE THIS INVOLVES THINGS SOME EXAMPLES WE TYPICALLY SEE LACK OF HOT WATER. LACK OF HEAT MOLD BED BUGS I CAN TELL YOU FROM FIRST PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. I WAS IN A PROPERTY IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY AND I WALKED IN AND A LITTLE CHILD STOOD UP COVERED HEAD TO TOE IN BED BUG. BITES THIS COULD NOT CONTINUE TO OCCUR IN CALIFORNIA. FORTUNATELY WE HAVE GOOD HOUSING LAWS THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE LOOPHOLES IN THESE LAWS. AND WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT SLUMLORDS OR DRIVING TRUCKS THROUGH THESE LOOPHOLES TO AVOID RESPONSIBILITY. TO REFUSE OR OR DELAYED ABATEMENT OTHER PROPERTIES AND TO DRIVE UP THE COST FOR COMPLIANCE. AS A RESULT OF THAT WE ARE SEEING TRAGEDIES OCCUR IN PROPERTIES LIKE THE GHOST SHIP FIRE. I KNOW GO SHIP OCCURRED A COUPLE YEARS AGO BUT I AM SAD TO SIT HERE BEFORE YOU AND TELL YOU WHAT THAT IS NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. THIS OCCURS AND I SEE IT ALL THE TIME IN CALIFORNIA. AS YOU THE THOUSANDS OF OUR CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER MEMBERS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WE CANNOT ALLOW SUB STANDARD HOUSING- TO BE EXCUSE FOR A HOUSING CRISIS. THIS BILL DOES THREE THINGS THESE THREE THINGS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO MAKE OUR LAWS MORE EFFECTIVE. EFFICIENT AND FAIR FROM THOSE SUFFERING AND SUBGENERA HOUSING. ONE IS A CLOSES A LOOPHOLE THAT MAKES CLEAR NOW WITH THIS BILL. THAT THIS LAW APPLIES TO ANY PROPERTY OCCUPIED REGARDLESS OF ZONING. MOLD BED BUGS FIRE HAZARDS ELECTRICAL HAZARDS THE DOES THESE ITEMS DON'T KNOW. A ZONING DISTRICTS THEY DON'T KNOW PROPERTY LINES. SO THEY DON'T CARE SO IS LIVING IN A WAREHOUSE OR NOT THEY'LL KILL THEM OR HURT THEM JUST THE SAME. SECONDLY IT GIVES A JUDGE DISCRETION. TO GIVE TENANT RELOCATION BENEFITS THAT ACTUALLY ARE EFFECTIVE I'VE SEEN CASES WHERE BECAUSE OF THE STRICT FORMULA IN THE LAW. THE RELOCATION BENEFITS ARE SO SMALL NO WE CAN ACTUALLY LIVE ANYWHERE WITH THAT THAT'S A REAL. CLEAR HERE. CURRENT LAW AND THIS LAW DOES NOT CHANGE THIS IS BILL NOT IT CURRENT LAW SAYS THE ONLY LAWFUL TENANTS ARE ENTITLED TO RELOCATION BENEFITS. THIS DOES NOT COVER AND WE DO NOT CHANGE THIS THIS DOES NOT COVER SQUATTERS OR TRUST PASSERS THIS IS ONLY PAYING TENANTS. WHO HAVE BEEN PAYING FOR THE INDIGNITY OF LIVING IN SUBSTANDARD HOUSING IN IF A COURT DETERMINES THAT THAT UNITIS SUB STANDARD AND NEEDS TO BE FIXED UP. THERE IS FOR SOMEONE TO LIVE IN IT WHILE THE OLDER OPEN WHILE LOGICAL ISSUES ARE BEING REPAIRED AWHILE KISSED BY HEAT IS NOT EVEN BEING PROVIDED THEY HAVE TO LIVE SOMEWHERE. ONLY IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE DOES THIS TENANT RELOCATION BENEFITS KICK IN AND THE ONLY THING THE BILL DOES. IS GIVE THE JUDGE DISCRETION TO SET OF VALUE THAT ACTUALLY WORKS FINALLY. THIS MAKES CLEAR THAT IF A SLUM LORD APPEALS THE ORDER WHICH IS THEIR RIGHT THIS IS NOT CHANGE THAT DUE PROCESS RIGHT. THAT THE MUST OBTAIN IN ORDER FROM THE COURT OF APPEAL TO STOP THE PROPERTY FOR BEING FIXED UP IN OTHER WORDS IF THEY USE A TWO OR THREE YEAR- PROCESS TO DRAG OUT A PEEL. IT CANNOT RESULT IN PEOPLE BEING FORCED FROM THAT PROPERTY WHILE THAT CONTINUES SO DOES NOT DIMINISH DUE PROCESS RIGHTS WHICH IS SACROSANCT. BUT IT DOES ENSURE THAT THE PROPERTY CAN BE FIXED UP WHILE SOMEONE DOES EXERCISE HIS DUE PROCESS RIGHTS. FINALLY A NOTE CODE ENFORCEMENT IS ONLY ABOUT COMPLIANCE THAT'S ALL WE'RE SEEKING THIS IS NOT A PROFESSION THAT ENGAGES IN PUNITIVE MEASURES WE'RE NOT GOING TO PUNISH ANYBODY ALL WE DO IS SEEK COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LAWS PASSED BY THIS LEGISLATURE AND BAR LOCAL OFFICIALS WHO ARE ALSO ELECTED SO I WOULD LIKE TO BE CLEAR THAT WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO TARGET PROPERTY OWNERS WERE SIMPLY LOOKING TO HOLD SLUMLORDS RESPONSIBLE IN ALL FINISHED WITH THIS. BEFORE WE EVEN GET TO THIS PROCESS IS LANDLORDS HAD BY MY COUNT AT LEAST SIX DIFFERENT NOTICES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO COMPLY EACH ONE OF THOSE WITH AN APPEAL WITHOUT I THINK YOU I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE WILL GO NOW TO ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IN THE ROOM FOUR AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT NAME AN ORGANIZATION.

UP ENFORCEMENT ON THE PANDEMIC SOME PORTIONS OF MIXED USE BUILDINGS WERE SHUT DOWN AS RETAIL OF COURSE WASN'T ABLE TO SURVIVE- WHILE OWNERS OF THESE GO TO SECURE THE SPACE IT WAS NOT UNCOMMON FOR INDIVIDUALS SEEKING COOLEY BREAK IN. AT SPACES WHAT THE OWNERS PERMISSION OR ASKING FOR IS A DEFINITION IN THE BILL THAT SAYS- THAT WOULD INCLUDE REFERENCE TO THE OWNER'S KNOWLEDGE- AND CONCERN- WITH ALL THAT SAID WE HAVE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE WE THANK- HER FOR THOSE MEETINGS.

THANK YOU WITH A QUICK DISCLOSURES WITH THIS ONE. ONE THOUSAND. ALL RIGHT AGAIN- GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY THREE- A. L. OUR STATE SURPLUS PROPERTIES BILL AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY THREE SIX THE SEEKS TO CODIFY AN EXECUTIVE ORDER. AND IMPLEMENT THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON STATE SURPLUS PROPERTIES IN ORDER TO ADD AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH ARE STATE IS DESPERATELY LACKING. AND TWENTY NINETEEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER N. ZERO SIX NINETEEN AND WHICH HE ORDERED THE DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL SERVICES AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY TO IDENTIFY AND PRIOR PRIORITIZE STATE SURPLUS PROPERTIES FOR COST EFFECTIVE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS. MANY OF US WERE HERE WHEN THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER CAME FORWARD AND WERE VERY I THINK EXCITED THAT THEIR WORST POSSIBLE HOUSING AHEAD. BUT LO AND BEHOLD- WE FOUND THAT WELL THE DEPARTMENTS WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY OVER FORTY FOUR. THOUSAND PARCELS I BELIEVE THAT WAS FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NOT FORTY FOUR THOUSAND SO I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR ONLY A FEW OF THE PARCELS WERE DEEMED SUITABLE FOR HOUSING AND IT WAS UNCLEAR WHAT THE PLANS WERE FOR MANY OF THEM HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED FOR AN AUDIT. THE STATE'S NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPACING ITS PRODUCTION WHICH IS NEXT NEGATIVELY AFFECTING CALIFORNIANS ACCORDING TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE REPORT BY THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP ONE POINT FOUR MILLION LOW INCOME. HOUSEHOLDS LACK TEST AFFORDABLE. DESPITE THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE STATE HAS FALLEN A HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITS SHORT ANNUALLY ON ITS GOAL FOR CREATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE RAPID CREATION OF FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS CRITICAL AND THE REAPERS PURPOSING OF STATE PROPERTIES IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY STEPS NECESSARY TO REACH THIS GOAL. AND AGAIN I WANT TO JUST ADD PERSONALLY I ASKED FOR THE SURPLUS OUT OF OUR AUDIT KNOWING THAT WE HAVE PARCELS OF LAND. THAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY MOVED FORWARD WITH SELLING OFF. TO OTHER INDIVIDUALS. DEV WE SHOULD BE. REAL FOLK. ON THESE. OF AS PART OUR PA TO COME THIS.

GOOD MORNING MARC STIVERS OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP AT THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER MAKING ACCESS STATE SITES AVAILABLE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS BEEN A RESOUNDING SUCCESS. AT TO DATE THE STATE IS OFFERED NINETEEN PROPERTIES. ALREADY IDENTIFIED SITES OF THE PROGRAM'S POTENTIAL TO CREATE THIRTY TWO THOUSAND ADDITIONAL HOMES TO ADDRESS CALIFORNIA'S UNPRECEDENTED HOUSING CHALLENGES. THE MAKING THE PROGRAM PERMANENT AND BY CODIFYING THE STATUTE AND INSTITUTIONALIZING THE STATE'S PROCEDURES ONLY MAGNIFY THE PROGRAM'S IMPACT. AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY THREE INSURERS AT THIS IMPORTANT PROGRAM WILL EXTEND BEYOND OUR CURRENT GOVERNOR. AND FURTHER PAN PERIODIC REVIEWS WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SITES AND HOMES THAT CAN BE BUILT. MEETING CALIFORNIA'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEEDS DEMANDS A LONG TERM COMMITMENT CONTINUALLY REASSESSING IN OFFERING EXISTE PROPERTIES FOR THIS PURPOSE IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THAT EFFORT WE ARE. STONE BUT WITH THE A CALIFORNIA APARTMENT THIS BILL- AB TWENTY TWO THIRDS OF PROVIDES A COMMONSENSE APPROACH- WE BELIEVE.

FOR THE FIRST. OKAY GREAT- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS LET ME START THINKING THE CHAIR SUGGESTED IS AN AMENDMENTS AND NOT THAT IS TO SAY THE ANGLE FOR HER WORK ON THE BILL AS WELL- WHILE PUBLIC ACQUISITION OF HOUSING CAN BE A BENEFICIAL TOOL TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE CURRENT USE OF THIS MODEL BY JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES AND FOR PROFIT PARTNERS FAILS TO GEARING TEEN PUBLIC BENEFIT COMMENSURATE WITH THE PUBLIC SUBSIDY. THE DOZENS OF TRANSACTIONS THAT OCCURRED TO DATE ARE NOT SUBJECT TO FIRM AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS OPERANDS THAT REMAIN ABOVE THE MARKET AVERAGE PAY OUT EXORBITANT FEES THAT ARE NOT ADEQUATELY MONITORED BY A PUBLIC ENTITY AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY WOULD SET MINIMUM STANDARDS OF OWNERSHIP FOR WHEN PUBLIC ENTITIES ACQUIRE MIDDLE INCOME HELPING TO ENSURE THAT FUTURE TRANSACTIONS ARE EQUITABLE FOR TENANTS THE LOCAL JURISDICTION IN OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO LOSE PROPERTY TAX REVENUES THIS WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW GPAS AND FOR PRIVATE FOR PROFIT INTEREST. TO ENTER INTO MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL AGREEMENTS THAT WILL SECURE AFFORDABLE AND MIDDLE INCOME HOUSING FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE CAN THIS NOT LIKE TO PRESENT MY WIN SUPPORT OF THE BILL MARK STIVERS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP AND EVEN DÍAS- REPRESENTING THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE MORNING OF MARCH DIVERS AGAIN WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP WE ALL SHARE AN INTEREST IN MEETING AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEEDS AT ALL INCOME LEVELS OF THIS BILL IS NOT ABOUT MIDDLE. LOW INCOME ABOUT ENSURING SORT OF ADEQUATE PUBLIC BENEFIT WHEN PUBLIC RESOURCES ARE USED. OPPONENTS OF THE BILL SO THAT THEY ARE PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO MIDDLE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WITH NO PUBLIC SUBSIDY. UNFORTUNATELY NEITHER OF THOSE IS TRUE. FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT THE SUBSIDY. BY DINT OF THE JOINT POWERS AGENCY OWNERSHIP THESE DEVELOPMENTS RECEIVE PROPERTY TAX BREAKS IN THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS PER YEAR. IN ADDITION THE BUYERS OF THE BONDS FINANCING THESE PURCHASES ARE NOT PAYING TAXES ON INTEREST. EARNINGS AFFORDABILITY OF THE LARGE MAJORITY OF CASES OF RENTS- THESE DEVELOPMENTS CHARGE REMAIN% WELL ABOVE HOW DETERMINED FAIR MARKET RENTS FOR THE PUBLIC BILLS IF CODE. KNOWN AS SMALL AREA FAIR MARKET RENTS. WHICH CONSIDERS ALL RENTAL UNITS OF THE TWENTY ONE GPA DEVELOPMENTS FOR WHICH WE HAVE RENT DATA THE WERE BELOW THE HUD BENCHMARK IN ONLY EIGHT DEVELOPMENTS. THE HEAD BENCHMARKING ONLY FIVE CASES AND ONLY THREE CASES WITH A HUNDRED AND 20% AM I RENTS BELOW THE BENCHMARK. THE RENT CALCULATION SHOULD I HANDED OUT TO ILLUSTRATE THIS OF UNAFFORDABILITY FOR PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT IN SANTA ROSA. THE RENT SAVINGS OPPONENTS CLAIM ARE IN COMPARISON ONLY TO CLASS A LUXURY APARTMENTS A VERY SMALL SUBSET OF THE OVERALL MARKET. THESE UNITS ARE NOT PARTICULAR AFFORDABLE IN THE GENERAL MARKET. WHEREAS WORKING FAMILIES NEED A SOLID CAMERA TO GET TO WORK- THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE OFFERING DISCOUNTS ON A FERRARI FOR PROFIT PROJECT ADMINISTRATORS ARE RECEIVING EXCESSIVE COMPENSATION ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE CONSIDERS THAT THEY ARE MERELY BUYING AND MANAGING EXISTING DEVELOPMENT. DEVELOPING SORELY NEEDED NEW HOUSING. THEY'RE RECEIVING UP FRONT FEES OF AS MUCH AS TWO MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE. THEY ARE ALSO GETTING AN ANNUAL ADMINISTRATIVE FEE IN THE SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR RANGE. AND BY WAY OF COMPARISON EIGHTY LIMITS ASSET MANAGER FEES AND TRUE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. LASTLY THERE HAD BEEN THEIR BENEFICIARIES OF A WHAT'S CALLED A B. BOND. A DEBT TO THE PROPERTY OFTEN A FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ACCRUING INTEREST AT 10% PER YEAR. THE SECOND DOCUMENT I HANDED OUT SHOWS THESE TO. SAMPLES OF THESE FEES. IN OUR VIEW OF THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO. PROVIDE A SUBSIDY THE PUBLIC SHOULD RECEIVE A COMMENSURATE PUBLIC BENEFIT. AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY ENSURES AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE AND ALSO ENSURES THE LONG TERM FEASIBILITY. ELEMENTS TECH BEGINS FEW. PLAINTIFFS L. SUPPORTS. OF MIDDLE. HOUSING WITH APPROPRIATE GUARDRAILS TO ENSURE THE TENANTS NOT JUST THE PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS RECEIVE ADEQUATE BENEFIT. THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING ONE OF THE POINTS WHICH WAS LIKELY TO TESTIFY TODAY. AND AMENABLE TO FURTHER OPENING UP THESE CONVERSATIONS TO ANY WHO ARE COMMITTED TO CONSTRUCTIVE SOLUTIONS. THERE'S GENERAL AGREEMENT THE GUARDRAILS ARE NEEDED FOR THE CURRENT FREE FOR ALL AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY WILL HELP US GET TO THAT. BALANCE SOLUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN FIFTY ON BEHALF OF THE NONPROFIT HOUSING ASSOCIATION OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. AB EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN CREWS RESPONSIBLE GUARDRAILS THAT ARE STANDARD IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUING WORLD AND APPROPRIATE AT ALL INCOME LEVELS. THE BILL REQUIRES THAT REGULATORY AGREEMENTS ENSURE AFFORDABILITY FOR FIFTY FIVE YEARS. OKAY AGREEMENT SIMPLY ARE THE PROJECT ADMINISTRATORS TO MAKE BEST EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED AFFORDABILITY AND ALLOW THE PROJECT TO CONVERT TO MARKET RATE AT ANY TIME THE PUBLIC ENTITY WISHES TO SELL. THIS IS NOT AN ADEQUATE GUARANTEED PUBLIC BENEFIT AND PUTS TENANTS OUR FUTURE RISK OF DISPLACEMENT. AS AMENDED THE BILL REQUIRES A CITY OR COUNTY ITSELF OR ITS CONTRACTORS TO MONITOR THE DEVELOPMENT FOR ON GOING COMPLIANCE USING T. TAX STANDARDS. IS A CONFLICT OF INTEREST FOR THE JPA TO MONITOR DEVELOPMENT IT OWNS AND DILIGENT MONITORING AS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC BENEFIT FORCE TO TAX ABATEMENT IS GIVEN IS ACTUALLY ACHIEVED. LASTLY THE BILL ENSURES LONG TERM FEASIBILITY BY REQUIRING THE USE OF RESPONSIBLE UNDERWRITING STANDARDS THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE CURRENTLY FUNDED WITH VERY RISKY FINANCING INCLUDING LOWER LOAN AMOUNTS HIGHLY EXCEEDING THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY AND INTEREST ONLY LOANS. OF GREATEST CONCERN IS THE FACT THAT DEVELOPMENTS ARE CREATING HUGE RESERVES JUST TO ME THEIR INTEREST OBLIGATIONS OVER THE FIRST FEW YEARS. COUNTY ON. THANK ROTH TO HIS OBLIGATIONS AND FUTURE AND HOPE IN THE RESERVES LAST LONG ENOUGH. BECAUSE A FOR CLOSURE VOIGTS ALL AFFORDABILITY REQUIREMENTS IT IS CRITICAL THAT WE SET THESE DEVELOPMENTS OUT FOR LONG TERM SUCCESS.

MOTIONS THIS IS THIS MORNING OR THIS IS THE AMERICA ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- MY NAME IS JORDAN LOS. I DON'T. THANK YOU AMERICA- THE ADDAMS MAYBE BRING A LITTLE CLOSER. I THINK IT'S ON OKAY AS A GOOD OKAY- GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS JORDAN LAWSON THE FOUNDER OF CATALYST HOUSING GROUP. THANK YOU TO THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY AND FOR YOUR STEADFAST COMMITMENT TO TACKLING OUR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS. CATALYST IS EQUALLY COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING TANGIBLE HOUSING SOLUTIONS OUR PRIMARY FOCUS AREA HAS BEEN CALIFORNIA'S ESSENTIAL MIDDLE INCOME WORKFORCE. WHOSE PAYCHECKS ARE INCREASINGLY CONSUMED BY RUNAWAY HOUSING COSTS. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS OUR FIRM'S INNOVATIONS HAVE EMPOWERED THE PRESERVATION. OF NEARLY FOURTEEN THOUSAND GOVERNMENTALLY OWNED RENT RESTRICTED HOUSING UNITS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. EACH TRANSACTION WAS APPROVED TO ENSURE THE DELIVERY OF IMPACTFUL PUBLIC BENEFITS. IN ADDITION TO IMMEDIATE RENT REDUCTIONS AND CAPS ON ANNUAL INCREASES ALL LONG TERM CONTROLS AN ECONOMICS HAVE BEEN GRANTED TO CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COUNTIES. ALL OF WHICH IS DOCUMENTED AND RECORDED MONITORED LEGAL AGREEMENTS. THIS IMPACTFUL MODEL HAS BECOME WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS ESSENTIAL HOUSING. CATALYST CURRENTLY OVERSEES NEARLY FORTY TWO HUNDRED GOVERNMENTALLY OWNED ESSENTIAL HOUSING UNITS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THIS PORTFOLIO ALREADY PROVIDE 16% DISCOUNTS THE MARKET RATE COMPETITORS AMOUNTED TO TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OF RENTAL SUBSIDIES. THOUSANDS OF OUR STATE'S ESSENTIAL WORKERS ARE FOR THE FIRST TIME FINDING PATHWAYS TO LIVE WORK AND THRIVE DIRECTLY WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. I APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY IN OPPOSITION OF AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY. WHILE WE APPLAUD THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING WOES THIS BILL FAILS TO CAPTURE THE NUANCE OF WHAT IT SEEKS TO LEGISLATE. IT INTRODUCES ARBITRARY REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL SLAM THE DOOR ON A PROVEN PRESERVATION TOOL A TIME WHEN SUCH CRITICAL SCALABLE SOLUTIONS ARE NEEDED MOST. WE ARE INCREDIBLY PROUD OF THE UNDENIABLE IMPACT ESSENTIAL HOUSING COMMUNITIES HAVE DELIVERED TO DATE. BUT ABOVE ALL WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON BEING MISSION DRIVEN HOUSING ADVOCATES. IF THIS COMMITTEE BELIEVES CHANGES TO THE BASELINE ESSENTIAL HOUSING MODELER CHOIR WE WILL HAPPILY RAISE OUR HAND TO ASSIST IN CRAFTING MORE THOUGHTFUL LEGISLATION. THAT SAID WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH PROPOSED GUARDRAIL SHOULD BE GROUNDED IN FACTS REALITY IN ALL OF THE REQUIRED NEW WANTS TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT I CENTRAL HOUSING IS AND AS IMPORTANT. IT IS NOT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I'LL BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN THE ROOM IN OPPOSITION. THEY WOULD LIKE TO ADD ON.

GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M JOHN STOKER REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL FINANCE AUTHORITY MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE SALMON FILET. THE SAME AFFAIRS A JOINT EXERCISE OF POWERS AUTHORITY MADE UP OF OVER THREE HUNDRED PLUS CITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE. THE SAME APPLIES BEEN WORKING ON ALLEVIATING THE HOUSING CRISIS FOR YEARS. CURRENTLY ACTIVELY WORKING TO FINANCE OVER A HUNDRED BEFORE THE HOUSING PROJECT. YOUR RECENT COMMITMENT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE SAME APPLIES SUBMITTED MORE APPLICATIONS SAID LACK. IN ALL OF THE OTHER ISSUES IN THE STATE'S COMBINED. HOWEVER WE'RE STILL LIMITED BY APPLAUDED CAPPED SAUTEED MORE PROJECT. GOV OUR INCOME RESIDENTS AFFORD MARKET RATE WITH OPTION THE LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS OF SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING FOR FOLKS IN THE MIDDLE ARE LEFT OUT IN COLD. THOSE HOUSEHOLDS ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO THE MISSING MIDDLE. THE MISSING MIDDLE INCLUDES WORKERS ARE CRITICAL TO THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND CRITICAL TO THE COMMUNITIES WE WORK. MISSING MIDDLE WORKERS PROVIDER EDUCATION OR HEALTH CARE PUBLIC SAFETY AND SERVICES PROGRAMS CAN PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED AFFORDABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THESE RESIDENTS AT A MUCH LOWER COST TO TAXPAYERS COMPARED TO PROGRAMS USING TAX CREDITS. WHICH PROVIDES HUGE SUBSIDIES OF ONLY SUBSIDIES THAT W HAVE USED ONE COME PROGRAM OUR PROPERTY TAX EXEMPTION. AND WE DO THIS PURPOSELY SO AS NOT TO COMPETE AGAINST OTHER AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS. THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION COMPLEX TAX CREDITS WITH OTHER FINANCING UNNECESSARILY STIFLE FOR KILL THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED. ESSENTIAL HOUSING THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES. CAROL SWEEPER GRANTORS THEY'RE DESPERATELY WAITING TO LIVE WHERE THEY WORK AT A MORE REASONABLE COST AND IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. BY AVOIDING LONG COMMUTES THE DAMAGE ON BARBARA.

THANK YOU POLICIES FOR THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES THERE- WE WILL BRING IT BACK TO. THE COMMITTEE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES ON THE BILL. MR GABRIEL. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR IN MY- MY COMPLIMENTS TO THE AUTHOR WHO I KNOW TO BE A REAL LEADER ON THESE ISSUES AND I THINK YOU OF- BROUGHT TO OUR ATTENTION A VERY IMPORTANT ONE- SOMEONE A COMPLIMENT YOU FOR THAT- THE I ALSO YOUR I'VE DISCUSSED THIS A LITTLE BIT AND I'VE HAD SOME HAD THE PLEASURE OF HAVING SOME CONVERSATIONS OFFLINE WITH MR STIVERS AS WELL I THINK IS ONE OF THE SHARPEST MINDS AROUND THE CAPITAL ON HOUSING ISSUES. I DID JUST WANT TO- SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS AND THEN ASK A FEW QUESTIONS- YOU KNOW I AM A BIG BELIEVER THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING I'M ALSO A BIG BELIEVER THAT WE NEED TO BE DOING ONE WORK FORCE HOUSING AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT AN OPINION THAT IS SHARED BY EVERYBODY- INSIDE. BY YOU KNOW I SEE THIS IN MY DISTRICT AND I. THAT I YOU KNOW I WANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR NURSES AND FIREFIGHTERS AND TEACHERS AND OTHER FOLKS ARE BEING PRICED OUT OF SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. TO LIVE IN MY COMMUNITY AND MANY OF THOSE FOLKS DON'T QUALIFY FOR. LOW INCOME. I DID RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE. THEY ARE BEING THEY'RE BEING PRICED OUT OF. BIG PARTS OF MY DISTRICT AT A VERY RAPID RATE SO I THINK THERE IS. A REAL PUBLIC POLICY CASE TO SUPPORT MISSING THAT'LL WORK FOR HOUSING. IT'S A GOOD USE OF TAXPAYER FUNDS TO DO THAT- AND SO TO ME I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS WORK MOVING THIS PROPOSAL FOR DOING SO- WITH A LOT OF NEW WANTS BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO OBJECTIVES HERE I THINK IT'S- EXCEPTIONALLY IMPORTANT WE ARE GOOD STEWARDS OF PUBLIC RESOURCES. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE THE THRUST OF YOUR BILL- BUT AT THE SAME TIME I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT'S GOING TO. INADVERTENTLY MAKE IT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT. OR CHALLENGING OR- A BALL TO DEVELOP MISSING THAT'LL WORK FOR HOUSING SO I THINK THE TRICK HERE IS TO. CRAFT THE GUARDRAILS IN A WAY THAT THEY ARE. NOT PROVIDING ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS BUT NOT MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE. TO DEVELOP THIS HOUSING AND SO. ON YOU KNOW I KNOW THAT YOU'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OPPOSITION. YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE MATERIALS THAT PER. THAT WERE PROVIDED THIS IS A- COMPLICATED TECHNICAL SUBJECT AND SO. THE CONVERSATIONS THAT YOU'RE HOT. YOU HAVE THEM. BUT BUT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME. YOU KNOW THE- HAD A BILL LAST YEAR ON MISSING MIDDLE WORK FORCE HOUSING THAT. THE GOVERNOR SIGNED INTO LAW THAT PASSED THE ASSEMBLY BY A VOTE OF SEVENTY NINE TWO ZERO SO I THINK THERE IS BROAD CONSENSUS HERE. IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT WORK FORCE HOUSING IS IMPORTANT SO I WANNA MAKE SURE AS WERE MOVING THIS AFTER FORWARD. WE'RE NOT CREATING. ADDITIONAL BARRIERS TO WORK FORCE HOUSING WHERE THEY WHERE THEY SHOULD BE PLACE BUT I KNOW THE AUTHOR TO BE. SUPER SHARP I KNOW THE PROPONENT TO BE. SUPER SHARP ON BOTH OF THE WITNESSES HERE. SOME CONFIDENT THAT IN YOUR CONVERSATIONS YOU GUYS ARE GONNA. FIND A WAY- THREAD THAT NEEDLE. I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD HERE WAS. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WERE RELATIVELY NEW. TERMS OF THE USE OF THESE J. P. AS- IN DO WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE ENOUGH DATA YET. TO BE ESTABLISHING. THESE GUARDRAILS AND REALLY YOU KNOW PUTTING SOMETHING INTO STATURE DO WE FIGHT WE NEED TO BE COLLECTING A LITTLE BIT MORE DATA BEFORE WE- START TO SET THE PARAMETERS OF THIS PROGRAM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT IN YOUR QUESTION- YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. HELPING TO INSURE THAT WE ARE DELIVERING ON THE WORK FORCE HOUSING THAT THE MIDDLE INCOME- BRANDS THAT WE ARE- TELLING BOTH LOCAL OFFICIALS AND THE- WOULD BE TENANTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO DELIVER ON- ACTUALLY I'M TRYING TO AND IN THE DEVELOPMENT PARTNERSHIP THAT IS GOING FORWARD- THERE ARE GOOD EXAMPLES I WANT THIS MODEL TO BE SUCCESSFUL BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY DELIVERING ON WHAT WE SAY. WE'RE GOING TO DO AND WHEN THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND YES THE DATA. ALAS MARC TO- COMMENTED THAT IN THE SECOND QUESTION- IS SHOWING SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THAT THAT'S WHY IT WAS NECESSARY TO COME IN AND SAY OKAY THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER CASES WERE YOU'RE USING PUBLIC SUBSIDY. AND IN THIS CASE FOR YOU ARE NOT ACQUIRING ANY- TAX AND PROPERTY TAX. BECAUSE USING PROPERTY TAX EXEMPT TEAM TAXES THAT BONDS. DOT IS IMPORTANT THEN FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THESE GUARANTEES ARE THERE PURDUE AND RENT OUT- THESE UNITS THAT NEED TO BE THERE FOR THE ONE HUNDRED THE ONE TWENTY IN MY CATEGORY- I KNOW THAT YOU PASSED OUT SOME DATA BUT MAYBE WANT TO ELABORATE ON THAT AS WELL AGAIN IT UNDERSCORES THE NEED FOR THIS BILL. HIS PRIVILEGE THERE ARE AT LEAST FORTY TWO OF THESE DEVELOPMENTS THAT I THINK THAT OCCURRED DURING. MR MAS MAY BE ABLE TO CONFIRM THAT BUT- WE'VE LOOKED AT DATA FOR TWENTY ONE OF THEM I THINK WE HAVE GOT. IT ON THE RENTS I THINK WE HAVE GOOD DATA ON WHAT THE FEES ARE THAT ARE BEING CHARGED. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'VE SORT OF DONE THE BAY AND WE HAD A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO. SAY YOU KNOW THE PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENTS GENTLY WORTH ABOUT. 10% AND IT SAVES ABOUT WHERE WE GET TO THIS FOR A 10% RATE SAVINGS IN THE BILL THAT WE'RE TRYING TO. ACHIEVE AND SO THAT'S- THAT'S- WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT DATA THERE COULD ALWAYS BE MORE BUT I THINK THAT'S A GOOD. START TO. GET INTO THIS FIELD BEFORE TO GET AWAY FROM US AND GUESTS TO BE- YOU KNOW. BUT A POTENTIAL. PURCHASE IT'S SOMETHING. IN ALL A HUGE AMOUNT. PROPERTY COULD BE TAKEN OFF THE PROPERTY TAX ROLLS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE DOING THAT RIGHT. FROM THE GET GO. IT JUST M. E. AWAY AS YOU LOOKED AT THOSE TWENTY ONE PROPERTIES I MEAN WAS THERE ARE. AND TRY TO THINK WHAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF RENTING WHERE THY PRETTY CLUSTERED AND- YOU KNOW. SORT OF SIMILAR MODELS AND ALL OF THEM OR WAS THERE. A VARIETY OF WAYS THAT. APPROACH THIS. I DO THINK THE VERY. A BIT- MISS. MAS MAY. L. S. B. TO THAT AS- BUT- THERE ARE USUALLY. UNITS AT EIGHTY PER. OF A- AGAIN THEY CAN. 84% IN AMERICA VERY DIFFERENT. WE DO IN THE TRADITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING WORLD. WE THINK OF AFFORDABILITY AS- THIRTY PERCENT. OF THE TARGET FAMILIES INCOME. THEY OFTEN USING 35% OF FAMILIES TARGET INCOME. BUT NONE THE LESS THEY ARE HAVING UNITS AT. ONE HUNDRED AND- TWENTY. THE ISSUE THOUGH IS THAT. THE AS A MAN IN A REMARKS THE HUNDRED AND 120% IN MY RENTS ARE OFTEN WAY ABOVE. JUST THE NORMAL MARKET. AND SO IT'S NOT. ME IT'S ONLY SORT F. AFFORDABLE IF YOU'RE COMPARING IT TO CLASSE LUXURY. PROPERTIES KNOCKED IT. IN THE MARKET- YEAH I GUESS I YOU KNOW I HESITATE TO USE THE WORD. I SO I. TEACH WHERE ABOUT. PRETTY GOOD ACTORS BUT OUR THEIR- EXAM. DON'T KNOW IF THE OPPOSITION. HAS ANYTHING TO ADD TO IT TO THE QUESTIONS I HAD ASKED. FOR I'D BE HAPPY TO THANK YOU. JUST GET THAT. UNIT COUNTER THE TRANSACTION COUNT. WE DID AN AUDIT OF THE ENTIRE. ESSENTIAL HOUSING SPACE- ALL OF THESE ARE OFFERED ALL OF THE INFORMATION IS FREE TO ANYONE WHO'S INTERESTED ON THE INTERNET- OUR ACCOUNT IS THAT THERE'S BEEN FORTY SIX TRANSACTIONS THOSE WOULD BE. BOND FINANCINGS SOME OF THOSE WERE SMALL PORTFOLIO SO THERE'S MORE THAN FIFTY ASSETS TOTAL. THAT'S ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND UNITS ACROSS THE STATE- THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS OF NOT EVERYTHING IS. SUPER HIGH END LUXURY BRAND NEW PRODUCT- WE PERSONALLY A CATALYST OVERSEE WHAT WE CALL VALUE ADDED. THE INDUSTRY OR NATURALLY OCCURRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING MUCH OLDER ASSETS WERE A LOT OF MONEY. IT'S CHUNK OF THE BOND PROCEEDS ARE ACTUALLY BE SPENT BEING SPENT ON UPGRADING SUBSTANTIALLY. THOSE THOSE PROPERTIES- I DO THINK THERE'S A LOT OF COMMON GROUND HERE 10% IF YOU WERE TO PICK A NUMBER AS TO. WHAT TYPE OF RENT REDUCTION- SHOULD BE HAD FOR A PRETTY TAX EXEMPTION TO PROVE THE PUBLIC BENEFITS BEEN CREATED ALL I CAN SPEAK TO IS CATALYST UNDERWRITING PRACTICES I CAN. SPEAK TO THE GRANULAR DETAIL ACROSS THE FOURTEEN ASSETS THAT WE CURRENTLY OVERSEE WHICH IS ABOUT FORTY TWO HUNDRED UNITS TOTAL WERE ABOUT A THIRD OF THIS TOTALLY CO SYSTEM- WE HAD A THIRD PARTY. MARKET STUDY DONE WE THOUGHT THAT THERE WOULD BE A BETTER EVALUATION OF WHAT CURRENT MARKET RENTS ARE. WITHIN ALL OF THE COMMUNITIES WHERE CATALYST OVERSEAS ASSETS ON BEHALF OF TWO DIFFERENT J. P. AS- IN COMPARISON TO OUR IN PLACE RENTS A WE SHIPPED OFF. THE RENT ROLLS AS OF A CERTAIN DATE. TO THIS THIRD PARTY MARKET PROVIDER SO THEY COULD SEE THE- THAT WERE BEING PAID THAT CAME UP WITH THEIR OWN CONCLUSION. THEY LANDED AT A 16% DISCOUNT IT RIGHT TODAY. AS MARKET RENTS ARE DETERMINED TODAY RENTS HAVE OBVIOUSLY BEEN CLIMBING SUBSTANTIALLY ESPECIALLY ON THE BACK OF CODE AND SOME OF THE TENANT PROTECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PEELED OFF. THAT AMOUNTS TO TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR. BILL SUBSIDY JUST AT ALL PROPERTIES AGAIN WE'RE ABOUT A THIRD OF THIS TOTALLY COOL SYSTEM. WE DO SHOOT WHEN WE UNDERWRITE THESE ASSETS FOR AT LEAST A 10% DISCOUNT TO MARKET RENTS. I THINK THE NEW WANTS TO USE THE WORDTHAT HAS COME UP A COUPLE TIMES HERE. IS IN HOW YOU CALCULATE MARKET RENTS- WE- CALCULATE RENTS YOU KNOW IT WAS REFERENCE THE THIRTY FIRST. PERCENT INCOME RATIO. BUT THE QUESTION AS TO WHAT YOU'RE MULTIPLYING THAT BY WE MULTIPLIED BY. COUNTY Y. T. CAC FIGURES THAT ARE USED IN TRADITIONAL CAPITAL A AFFORDABLE HOUSING. A LOT OF OUR PROPERTIES ARE ACTUALLY AT 30% A VERY MEDIAN INCOME. WERE AWARE OF THE FACT THAT SOME OTHERS OF USE 35% SOME OF OUR TRANSACTIONS WITH THIRTY FIVE PERCENT- BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THE METHODOLOGY THAT'S BEING USED IS NONSTANDARD. WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF A 10% MINIMUM DISCOUNT. THERE'S JUST A LOT OF NEW WANTS AROUND HOW YOU CALCULATE THAT. WHEN A PROPERTY IS HAD RAPIDLY ESCALATING RENTS AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN THE THIRD PARTY VALIDATED DATA THAT WE CAN PROVIDE TODAY. THAT WITH THE ROCK. RIGHT GROWTH THAT WE ARE SEEING AND UNFORTUNATELY EXPECT TO CONTINUE SEEING GIVEN HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO BUILD NEW SUPPLY IN THE STATE. THAT THIS IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A MASSIVELY VALUABLE PRESERVATION-TOOL AND OUR PRIMARY CONCERN. IS THAT WE QUICKLY LEGISLATE AWAY THE ONLY PRESERVATION TOOL THAT EXISTS TODAY FOR MIDDLE. EAST YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT I APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK- YOU KNOW BY. PROBABLY SPOKEN AND I THINK EVERYBODY IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT WHAT I'M HEARING AT LEAST IS THERE SOME THERE'S SOME BROAD PARAMETERS OF AGREEMENT HERE THERE'S SOME DETAILS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED OUT- I THINK WE'RE ALL GOING TO TRY TO AIM FOR THAT SWEET SPOT MY CONFIDENCE HE GUYS ARE GONNA DO IT SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY WITH THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COLLEAGUES. AND IS THERE A MOTION SOME OF THEM IN A SECOND. MISS QUIRK-SILVA OR SECOND THE BILL- SOUL AND ALL L. A. CLOSER TO SECOND BUT YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW THIS BILL DOES TRY TO SET SOME OF THOSE- PARAMETERS ON HOW GPAS AND THEIR PARTNERS CAN USE PUBLIC DOLLARS. AND THE FORMER PROPERTY TAXES AND TAX EXEMPT BONDS TO PURCHASE A MARKET HOUSING I THINK ALSO CRITICALLY THE BILL DOES THIS BY REQUIRING INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT RENTS TO BE MORE DEEPLY AFFORDABLE WHICH I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO GET OUT HERE AND I KNOW MY OFFICE WORKED WITH THE SPONSORS- TO CRAFT AMENDMENTS TO CREATE SOME ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY. AFTER THE GPAS AT USE THIS MODEL WALK WHILE CREATING MORE PUBLIC BENEFIT THROUGH LOWER RENTS I WOULD JUST ASK THAT THE- OPPOSITION REALLY COME TO THE TABLE TO TRY TO REALLY NEGOTIATED DEAL HERE THAT I THINK HOPEFULLY WE CAN LAND IN THAT SWEET SPOT AND- AS WELL TO GET YOU TO WORK WITH THE OFFICE- TOWARDS THAT END WHICH I KNOW MISTER BOARD YOU WILL DO. I'M CITIES YOU WANT TO GET IN PLACE FOR THIS CAN BE I THINK NECESSARY GUARDRAILS BUT DOES SO IN A WAY THAT STILL MABEL'S THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS TO MOVE FORWARD SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO. HELP MOVE THE BILL OUT OF THE COMMITTEES TODAY- AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AGAIN THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR COMMENTS AND OFFER COMMITTEE COMMENTS AS WELL WE COVER OUR STATE. THE TELL THE. EGGMAN ARE WE WILL. AND ALL THAT WILL BE IT DON'T WANT TO PASS OUT OF THE LEGISLATURE ARE LAW THAT ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO KILL- WHAT WHAT ARE OTHERWISE WOULD BE VERY DEALS TO PRODUCE UP WORK HOUSING SO WITHOUT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. A THANK YOU. MOTION IS TO AS A- WICKS I SEYARTO. NINE MAUREEN CARILLO- GABRIEL HI GABRIEL I KALRA KALRA AYE KILEY QUIRK-SILVA QUIRK-SILVA I WARD WAR DIE. FIFTY FOUR AND THAT BILLS OUT THANK YOU. WE WILL MOVE ON NOW TO- MR LEE HAS A MINOR TECHNICAL BILL. YOU KNOW ME WELL YEAH. READY WHEN YOU ARE MISTER LEE. THEN YOU KNOW HOW YOU GO AND THEN WE'LL HAVE YOU. YEAH. NO PROBLEM SIR. BUT. PAGE. I THINK THAT'S PRESENTING INFORMS. RIGHT YEAH MAYBE THAT'S IT. THIS IS INCREDIBLY. THE SECOND. LARA TWO ANALYSTS WHAT FUTURE. VETERANS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEAVE WHEN YOU'RE READY OKAY. SO I BROUGHT SOME PROPS FOR YOU TO VISUALIZE SUCCESS OF VISUALIZE WHAT WE ARE AIMING FOR I HAVE GREAT PLEASURE IN PRESENTING TODAY AB TWENTY FIFTY THREE THE SOCIAL HOUSING ACT FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE- COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND ALL THE PROPONENTS ON CRAFTING THIS BILL AS WELL AS A CHAIR- BUFFY WICKS FOR- CHANGES LET COMMITTEE ON SOCIAL HOUSING THE SOCIAL HOUSING ACT WILL PRODUCE A PRESERVE FOR THE HOUSING AND ALL OF CALIFORNIA. THROUGHOUT THROUGH THIS MODEL HOUSING WILL BE AFFORDABLE FOR ALL INCOME LEVELS BECAUSE LIKE DELEON UNION BELTS AND FINANCIALLY SELF SUSTAINING HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WITH HIGHER INCOMES WILL CROSS SUBSIDIZE LOWER INCOME UNITS THE RENT SOLIDARITY AND ALLOW HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS TO BE REVENUE NEUTRAL THIS MODEL SOCIAL HOUSING HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL BOTH INTERNATIONALLY AND OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY. SO HERE WE HAVE VIENNA WHICH IS THE POSTER CHILD OF SOCIAL HOUSING HAS HAD THEIR PROGRAM FOR WELL OVER A HUNDRED YEARS NOW. AND THIS IS THE MOST CITED EXAMPLE OF SOCIAL HOUSING IS NOT TYPICAL OF ALL SOCIAL HOUSING EVEN IN AUSTRIA. BUT 60% OF ALL VIENNESE RESIDENTS LIVE IN SOCIAL HOUSING AND MOST PAY THREE HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS PER MONTH AND RENTS. ARE SOCIAL HOUSING. DEVELOPMENTS NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE THIS ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY HIGH DEMAND EVEN IN AUSTRIA. AND THE US. IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY RIGHT HERE BEHIND ME. DO YOU THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES COMMISSION IN MARYLAND HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY BUILDING HOUSING INSPIRED BY SOCIAL HOUSING IN VIENNA. AND ELSEWHERE. THEY PLAN TO BUILD OVER FIVE THOUSAND UNITS USING A SIMILAR APPROACH pTO WHAT IS PROPOSED IN THIS BILL IN CALIFORNIA OVER 97% OF CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE NOT PRODUCED ENOUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AND MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE BURDENED BY HOUSING COSTS WITH ONE IN FIVE HOUSEHOLDS SPENDING OVER HALF. OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING SO IT'S CLEAR THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS ADDITIONAL TOOLS TO HELP SOLVE THE HOUSING SHORTAGE AND SOCIAL HOUSING IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF THAT. SOCIAL HOUSING GIVES US IN THE PUBLIC AS A STATE OF CALIFORNIA DIRECT TOOLS TO BUILD HOUSING THAT IS BADLY NEEDED WE HAVE A LOT OF INCENTIVES AND SIX IN CARE. THERE BUT WE DO NOT HAVE THE DIRECT TOOLS TO BUILD HOUSING OURSELVES AND IF WE ARE TO MEET THE MOMENT AND DEMAND THAT CALIFORNIA'S LEAD WE HAVE TO HAVE ALL THE TOOLS POSSIBLE. SO I LIKE TO CONCLUDE BY THANKING OUR SPONSORS THE BUILDING TRADES- CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION EAST BAY FOR EVERYONE CAN BE ACTION THE SJSU HUMAN RIGHTS INSTITUTE FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND ALL THE IN. CREDIBLE SUPPORTERS ON HERE. AND TODAY I AM JOINED HERE LIVE IN PERSON BY ALLIE SACRAMENT THE HOUSING ACTION COALITION.

SO I'LL HAVE YOUR FIRST. THANK YOU GO AHEAD INDIA. HI MY NAME IS ALLEY SAY BERMAN AND I'M SPEAKING IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB TWENTY FIFTY THREE I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSING ACTION COALITION A MEMBER SUPPORTED NONPROFIT THAT ADVOCATES FOR CREATING MORE HOUSING FOR RESIDENTS OF ALL INCOME LEVELS TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE BAY AREA ON CALIFORNIA'S HOW TO HOUSING SHORTAGE DISPLACEMENT AND AFFORDABILITY CRISIS I'M ALSO HERE AS SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN DIRECT IMPACT THEIR STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS. I MOVED TO THE BAY AREA FROM FLORIDA WHEN I WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD TO PURSUE THE FANTASTIC EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT CALIFORNIA HAS TO OFFER AND ALSO TO ESCAPE THE CONSERVATIVE A FLORIDA. CONSERVATISM OF FLORIDA. I QUICKLY LEARNED THAT THE BAY AREA HOUSING OPTIONS WERE DESIGNED FOR STUDENTS LIKE ME. IN ORDER TO BARELY AFFORD TO BE A STUDENT HERE I HAD TO WORK THREE JOBS AT A TIME TOTAL OF EIGHTY HOURS A WEEK. IN ADDITION TO MY SCHOOL COURSEWORK EVEN JUGGLING THREE JOBS MY RENTAL COSTS CONSUMED MORE THAN 75% OF MY INCOME. AND MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PAY FOR OTHER NECESSITIES LIKE HEALTHCARE. AND THE SCANT HOUSING OPTIONS I COULD AFFORD WERE LIMITED TO RENTING OUT A LIVING ROOM OR SHARING A TWO BEDROOM ONE BATH WITH SIX PEOPLE. DUE TO MY LIMITED HOUSING OPTIONS I FACE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HOMOPHOBIA AND TRANSPHOBIA IN MY HOME. AS A RESULT I MOVED TEN TIMES IN FOUR YEARS TO TRY TO FIND BETTER ALTERNATIVES. MEANWHILE WHILE STRUGGLING TO FIND ADEQUATE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING I WAS DEALING WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN MY WORKPLACE. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT TOXIC WORKPLACE FOR OVER A YEAR DO NOT HAVE A LAPSE OF INCOME. WHICH WITHOUT AN INCOME CUSHION WHAT RESULTED IN HOMELESSNESS. THIS IS FLAT OUT UNACCEPTABLE. MY STORY IS NOT UNUSUAL. IN FACT IT IS THE NORM FOR LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME FOLKS IN THE BAY AREA. WE NEED EVERY TOOL TO BE BUILDING HOUSING FOR EVERYONE AND SOCIAL HOUSING IS ANOTHER TOOL WE MUST SERIOUSLY EXPLORE. WE HAVE A SERIOUS HOUSING SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA OVER NINETY PERCENT. 90% OF CITIES AND- SEVEN UNABLE TO PRODUCE ENOUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SOCIAL HOUSING MAKES IT EASIER TO COMBAT THE HOUSING SHORTAGE AND AFFORDABILITY CRISIS PLEASE SUPPORT EIGHTY TWENTY FIFTY THREE SO PEOPLE LIKE ME HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE IN STRIVE. IN THE STATE WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS.

AB TWENTY FIFTY THREE CONCEIVES OF A MODEL OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT THAT PRODUCES MIXED FAMILIES MIXED INCOME FAMILY HOUSING WITH RELATIVE EASE. SOMETHING THAT EVEN THE BEST INTENTIONS NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER STRUGGLE TO DO BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF OUR CURRENT SYSTEMS WERE FINANCING HOUSING. IT INCORPORATES CRITICAL WORKER PROTECTIONS GUARANTEED THE USE OF CHILDREN TRAINED WORKFORCE AND PAYMENT OF PREVAILING WAGE TO CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ON THE PROJECTS CONTEMPLATED BY THE BILL. IT APPLIES A PROVEN SELF SUSTAINING MODEL FOR MAINTENANCE AND CAN YOU DEVELOPMENT IF THE SILICATES THE EMPOWERMENT AND SELF DETERMINATION OF THOSE RESIDING IN SOCIAL HOUSING COMMUNITIES ONCE BUILT. AND IT NEVER WORRIES WHETHER THERE'S ENOUGH PROFIT TO MAKE THE PROJECT PENCIL. IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE MAGIC A FAIRYTALE STORY THAT CAN'T POSSIBLY BE REAL THERE ARE MANY WITH STRONG PERSONAL MOTIVES THAT WILL WORK VERY HARD TO CONVINCE YOU THAT IT IS. BUT THE TRUTH IS IT'S A MODEL THAT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY PRODUCING HOUSING WITH THOSE POSITIVE CHARACTERISTICS AROUD THE WORLD FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY. HOUSING IS A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE NEXT UNITED NATIONS STATED RATHER THAN TREATING HOUSING AS A COMMODITY VALUE PRIMARILY AS AN ASSET FOR THE ACCUMULATION OF WEALTH. GOVERNMENTS MUST RECLAIM HOUSING AS A SOCIAL GOOD AND THOUSAND SURE THE HUMAN RIGHT TO A PLACE TO LIVE IN SECURITY AND DIGNITY. TAKE A MOMENT TO IMAGINE WHAT WE COULD ACCOMPLISH TOGETHER IF WE ALL AGREED THAT HOUSING IS A HUMAN RIGHT. THAT GOVERNMENT EXISTS TO PROTECT AND PROVIDE HUMAN RIGHTS THAT NO SHOULD PROFIT FROMPROVIDING WITH HOLDING A HUMAN RIGHT THAT THE PROVISION OF BASIC RIGHTS SHOULD NEVER DEPRIVE THOSE WHO GIVE THEIR LABOR TO PROVIDE AND PROTECT OUR ESSENTIAL DIGNITY AND HUMANITY. THESE THINGS MIGHT SOUND IDEALISTIC HOW CAN ANY OF US A BY ALLOWING THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TO BECOME THE PLACE WHERE HUMAN RIGHTS COME TO BE SOLD OFF FOR. AB TWENTY FIFTY THREE WILL CREATE SELF SUSTAINING HOUSING THAT WILL BE PERMANENTLY AFFORDABLE TO WORKING CALIFORNIANS OF ALL INCOME LEVELS IT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS BY DEVELOPING HOMES FOR THE SOCIAL BENEFIT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. RATHER THAN FOR THE PROFIT OF A FEW AND IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT. IT THE FIFTY EIGHT. DO YOU TO DO THE SAME TODAY THANK YOU.

MELCHER ONCE AGAIN THE KEY WAS CLEAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOT BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ROOM AND MISTER KALRA FELL BY MR WARD'S. YEAH NUMBER- I'MVERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS BILL LOOK FORWARD TO BE TENDED TO JOIN AND- ON THE BILL ITSELF BUT- IT'S GREAT TO SEE A COALITION COMING TOGETHER- CREATING CRITICALLY IMPORTANT HOUSING CREATING GREAT JOBS- AND CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY- FOR WHEN. AT TIMES I SALAS A LOT WHEN I WAS IN THE COUNCIL SAN JOSE AT TIMES WHEN IT CAN BE CHALLENGING TO FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO GET THEIR FINANCING ONLINE AND MAKE IT PENCIL OUT WHAT HAVE YOU THAT- THAT- PUBLIC- JURISDICTIONS CAN ON THEIR OWN. FIND A WAY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN- AND- WITHOUT RUNNING BUT THE PROFIT MOTIVE WORRYING ABOUT THE HOUSING- AND CREATING GREAT JOBS WHILE WE'RE AT IT SO- I THINK THIS IS- AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL OF US. TO GET BEHIND- AND I FIND IT YOU KNOW. RESPECTIVAS BUT I THINK PART OF THE ARGUMENT AS LITTLE. PECULIAR PARTICULARLY THE- LAW ON THE- PRODUCTION OF PROPERTY TAX LEVY IS WHEN I. THOUGHT THE VILLAGERS REALLY LIKED WHEN PROPERTY TO. A REDUCE MAYBE IF THEY CAN'T BENEFIT MAYBE THEY'LL SUPPORT AS MUCH BUT- AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS THE REALITY IS. B. BENEFIT A LOT MORE BY MAYBE REDUCING SOME OF THOSE LOCAL PROPERTY TAX REVENUES BUT WHAT WE GAIN ADDED CREATING. AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK IN SUCH A MEANINGFUL WAY SO I REALLY PREFER- AND- IT HAS BEEN REMOVED. AND HAPPY WITH BILL. GREAT WE HAVE A MOTION SECOND AND MISTER WARD. THANK YOU I REALLY WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR A LOT OF WORK YOU PUT INTO THIS ALL OF LAST YEAR- THROUGHOUT THE FALL RESEARCH PERIOD AND THEN OF COURSE. TO BRING THIS FORWARD AND SUCH AN AMAZING FORM HERE TODAY PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS I THINK IT REALLY. HELPS- WHAT EXISTS IN. PATRICK FORM ACROSS THE STATE BUT DEFINITELY NOT ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE ALL IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THIS MODEL- REALLY THANKFUL THAT YOU'RE BRINGING SUCH A WIDE. COALITION OF- OF GROUPS- INTO THIS PROCESS AND- I KNOW ONE THING I JUST WANT IT- LEE ON THE RECORD TO THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT- BECAUSE- THERE ARE FUNDING STREAMS TO EXISTING FOR SOME OF THE LOCAL NEWS FOR EXAMPLE. OUR HOUSING COMMISSION OR HOUSING AUTHORITY- IS ABLE TO ITS HOUSING DEVELOPERS. ARE ABLE TO DO THIS DIRECTLY- KITA- HERE IN SACRAMENTO ANOTHER KIND OF EXAMPLE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANYTHING THAT THE STATE IS DOING ISN'T GOING TO IMPEDE. ON THE ABILITY FOR DIRECT PASSWORD DIRECT FLOW TO SOME OF THOSE LOCAL ENTITIES THAT ARE ALREADY ABLE TO PRODUCE- EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE STATEWIDE SO THANK YOU FOR THIS. REALLY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY. QUIRK-SILVA. GOOD AFTERNOON BILL I THINK FOR A CLOSED UP NEWS- OKAY IT FEELS LIKE IT'S- I DO APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR THIS VISION AND THE GRAPHICS ARE INTERESTING TO ME- EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT WE'RE DID YOU SEE THESE GRAPHICS ARE FROM VIENNA THIS ONE IS VIENNA THIS ONE IS IN MARYLAND. OKAY MARYLAND YEAH. ZERO TWO TO ME IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT I'M INTERESTED IN MY MAJOR CONCERN ARE ALL FIRST OF ALL SETTING UP A NEW AUTHORITY AS I'VE ALREADY TALKED TO YOU ABOUT WE HAVE MULTIPLE AUTHORITIES UNDER THE HOUSING UMBRELLA AND WITH THOSE MULTIPLE AUTHORITIES WE STILL SEEM TO HAVE. AN ISSUE WITH BRINGING FORWARD MORE AND MORE LEGISLATION TO STREAMLINE TO REDUCE ALL OF THESE THINGS AND WE'RE KIND OF STUCK SO TO ADD YET ANOTHER AUTHORITY- BY THE WAY WE HAVE SO MANY AUTHORITIES IN CALIFORNIA I CAN'T EVEN COUNT A MALL UNDER MANY UMBRELLAS AND THIS CAUSES A LOT OF THIS BUREAUCRATIC ISSUE I MEAN RIGHT IT CHAIR. OF COMMUNICATION AND CONVEYANCING PULLING BROADBAND ACROSS THE STATE SOUNDS GREAT BROADBAND FOR ALL AND NOW WE'RE WORKING WITH MULTIPLE AUTHORITIES AND FINDING THAT IT'S NOT SO EASY WHEN YOU HAVE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS SO THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE FOR ME- JUST SETTING UP A NEW BOARD IN YOUR BILL THE FINANCING AND START UP COSTS THIS IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. IT SAYS THE BILL STATES THAT THE C. HA HE CALIFORNIA HOUSING AUTHORITY NEW AUTHORITY. SO NOT. WORKING WITH THE OTHER AUTHORITIES BUT THE NEW AUTHORITY OPERATE ACCORDING TO PRINCIPLES OF REVENUE NEUTRALITY THOUGH IT DOES NOT SPECIFY THE TIME PERIOD OVER WHICH REVENUE NEUTRALITY WOULD BE ACHIEVED- AND THAT OF COURSE YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE START UP CAPITAL. SO THE START UP CAPITAL MEANS WHERE YOU GET GETTING THE FUNDS TO START THIS NEW AUTHORITY AND IN THE BILL IT SAYS OBLIGATION BY. SO IN- GETTING THIS THEN YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE ANOTHER PIECE OF LEGISLATION FOR THESE OBLIGATION BONDS THAT WOULD REQUIRE A TWO THIRDS. VOTE SO AGAIN I'M JUST POINTING THIS OUT BECAUSE AS ATTRACTIVE AS THE SET THIS SEEMS AN AS MUCH OF A COALITION AS YOU HAVE ON BOARD CERTAINLY NOT SOMEBODY WHO'S TRYING TO GET IN THE WAY. OF THE- BUT WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO PEEL THE ONION BECAUSE- THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN HERE IN THE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE KEEP MAKING THESE BROAD ATTEMPTS. AND THEN WE HAVE YET ANOTHER AUTHORITY TO FUND. AND WHEN WE HAVE TO FUNDED AUTHORITY WITH THE NINE MEMBER PANEL PLUS THE EMPLOYEES AND ALL OF THE- ARTS THAT IT WOULD TAKE ONCE THE UNITS ARE BUILT THEY'RE NOT JUST BUILT THEY HAVE TO BE SUSTAINED. SO YOU'VE ADDRESSED THE WORK FORCE TO BUILD THEM BUT THEN THERE'S ALSO THE SUSTAINABILITY AND ALL TOO OFTEN AND PUBLIC HOUSING THAT WE'VE SEN ACROSS THE STATE OF CRIME CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE SOME DIRE IMAGES OF WHAT WE CALL PROJECTS. AND WHAT HAPPENED AND HE'S COUNTIES WHEN THEY WEREN'T SUSTAINED. SO THAT THAT'S MY CONCERN IS THAT I CERTAINLY WANT TO SEE OPPORTUNITIES AND YOU'VE HEARD MAYBE A BROKEN RECORD UP HERE I MEAN WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE NEED MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT- WHEN WE ADD ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES I MEAN I YEAH I THINK IN THIS AGENDA WE HAVE THREE TYPES OF AUTHORITIES THAT WE COULD BE APPROVING SO I'M JUST MAKING THOSE COMMENTS- BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT AS THIS MOVES FORWARD THOSE THINGS ARE SERIOUS. ISSUES THE FINANCING OF THE AUTHORITY THE BONDING OF THE STORY AND THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THESE UNITS- IF AND WHEN THEY GET BILLED BECAUSE HOPEFULLY THAT IS THE END RESULT THAT THERE ARE. MANY MANY HUNDREDS OF AFFORDABLE UNITS BUT LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT ANOTHER WE DON'T WANT TO JUST BUILD SOMETHING IF WE CAN'T SUSTAIN IT. BECAUSE WE DON'T SUSTAIN IT THEN WE HAVE- YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT THE FIRST YEAR IT'S BUILT BUT TEN YEARS DOWN TWENTY YEARS DOWN THIRTY YEARS WHAT IS THAT GOING TO LOOK LIKE SO THAT'S MY QUESTION THAT IS NOT REALLY QUESTION IT'S MOSTLY A COMMENT- BUT I DO APPLAUD YOU FOR YOUR- VISION I KNOW EVEN. IN TIRELESSLY ON THIS AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE. THAT ARE HOPING THAT THIS WILL MOVE FORWARD. MISS KOREA THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I DON'T THINK. THE AUTHOR CAN NOT A LACK OF I THANK THE AUTHOR FOR ALL THE WORK THAT HE'S DONE ON ON THIS BILL I LOOK AT THE GRAPHICS AND BY THE WAY BIG FAN BIG FAN OF PRESENTATION GRAPHICS WE GET TO WE GET TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE- TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE PLACES LIKE VIENNA IN WHICH THIS HAS BEEN A REALITY OR EVEN THE STATE OF MARYLAND OR THIS IS A REALITY- YOU KNOW I REPRESENT THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND- VERY UNIQUE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT SURROUND. IN THE URBAN CORE VALET THAT'S AROUND DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES PERCENT HISTORIC COMMUNITIES AND SADLY WE HAVE RUN OUT OF SPACE- THAT'S A BIG CONCERN- THAT WE JUST HAVE IN THE CITY AND NEIGHBORHOODS THAT I REPRESENT HOWEVER THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WITHIN L. A. COUNTY AND WITHIN OTHER PARTS OF LOS ANGELES THIS CAN BE A REALITY- YOU KNOW I THINK ABOUT ALL THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE AROUND TRANSPORTATION OPERADORES EXTENSION OF TRAINS AND TRANSIT SYSTEMS THE CONNECTIVITY OF OUR CITY THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND IN THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. HOW INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE IT'S BECOME TO LIVE IN MY OWN COMMUNITY I JUST HAD A HOMES A TWO BEDROOM SMALL LITTLE IT'S YOU KNOW HALF THE SIZE OF THIS COMMITTEE ROOM SELL FOR ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN THE COMMUNITY OF EL SERENO RIGHT NEXT TO WHERE I LIVE YOU KNOW I'M A STATE LEGISLATOR BUT CAN'T AFFORD A IN THE COMMUNITY THAT I REPRESENT MUCH MANY OF US BECAUSE IT'S JUST GOTTEN SO INCREDIBLY- EXPENSIVE IN THE CALIFORNIA DREAM OF HOMEOWNERSHIP JUST SEEMS INCREDIBLY OUT OF REACH. AND SO WHILE YOU KNOW I DO I CALL MY COLLEAGUES A CONCERN IN TERMS OF WILL HAVE THIS DONE HOW DO WE CREATE AN AGENCY HOW DO WE FIND IT HARD WHAT IS IT WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE THAT'S OUR JOB OUR JOB IS TO FIGURE THAT OUT- AND HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS I THINK IS PART OF THE SOLUTION I THINK INVOLVING VARIOUS DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS NOT ONLY IN HOUSING COMMITTEE- BUT ALSO AND BUDGET. TO INSURE THAT WE'RE DOING WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO CREE. THE NEW OPERA. THAT WE NEED TO SEE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SOCIAL HOUSING IS AN ANSWER TO THAT- I ENVY OTHER CITIES THAT HAVE MORE SPACE. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THAT'S PART OF THE CONVERSATION I GETS TO HAPPEN IN TERMS OF WHERE ARE THE POTENTIAL AND OPPORTUNITIES TO. MEET THIS- AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO TWO ONE BEING OF A PRINCIPAL JOINT AUTHORS TO THIS BILL- BUT ALSO SEEN THE CONVERSATIONS MOVE FORWARD IN COMMITTEE- NOT ONLY IN OUR HOUSE BUT IN THE SENATE AS WELL AND ENSURING THAT. HE KNOWS CLEARLY AS WE THINK ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE CLIMATE JUSTICE TRANSPORTATION. TRANSIT CORRIDORS HOUSING HOMELESSNESS. THE CONVERSATION AROUND REDUCING HOUSING PRICES YOU KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY DOES THAT WHEN YOU SEE BLIGHT IN OUR COMMUNITY. WHEN YOU SEE ENCAMPMENTS AND OUR COMMUNITY WHEN YOU SEE INDIVIDUALS THAT CLEARLY NEEDS. SERVICE IS NOT RECEIVE THEM- IN OUR COMMUNITY I KNOW IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE ACROSS OUR STATE. REGARDLESS OF INCOME REGARDLESS WHERE YOU COME FROM REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD LOOKS LIKE. WE AS A SOCIETY NEED TO FIGURE OUT A VERY REAL SOLUTION TO HOUSING HOMELESSNESS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES CLIMATE CHANGE TRANSIT AND IT'S ALL CONNECTED. BECAUSE PEOPLE FAMILY WORKING FAMILIES CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO LIVE IN MY DISTRICT THE ONLY FURTHER OUT. THEY DRIVE FURTHER IN. IT ONLY INCREASES IN OUR CARBON EMISSIONS AND SO IT'S ALL CONNECTED AND I THINK IT'S A MATTER OF JUST FIGURING OUT WHAT THAT SOLUTION IS SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE HARD WORK THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE DONE. ON THIS BILL FOR INCLUDING OF THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AROUND. EVERYTHING ALL OF THOSE WORKERS OR ANYTHING SHE SAID THAT MIKE DOWN- AND- AND ENSURING THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING COLLABORATIVELY TO SECURE SOLUTIONS FOR. IT'S ACROSS AND WELCOME TO FROM SAN DIEGO WELCOME TO THE SACRAMENTO I SAW YOUR TWEET THIS MORNING. CARS AND AN OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE- MUTE THE PHONE LINES WHEN WORD SPEAKING IN COMMITTEE THAT BE GREAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISCREANTS ROBBED. OF ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM FOLKS IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM. AND DO WE HAVE- YEAH. MY NAME IS FRANKLIN ANDRADE ALONG BRANDON'S RETURNED WORK ON ONE HIT CAN YOU PLEASE QUITE THE PHONE LINES. BUFFALO'S QUIET FRANCINE JUST POPPING UP IN THE GROUP AS A FULLY YOU'LL HAVE TO TURN ON THE MOMENT. WITH OUR PHONE OKAY THANK YOU- DID WAS STARTED WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. OKAY MISTER COLOR MOVE THE BILL MISCREANT- SECONDED THAT FINE OKAY. OKAY IT'S LIKE NINETEEN SEVENTIES TECHNOLOGY MEETS TWENTY TWENTY TWO TECHNOLOGY- WELL I JUST WANNA- REALLY APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR PUTTING OUT THIS- VISION OF A BILL AND HE AND I HAVE WORKED IN THE SPACE TOGETHER SINCE HE GOT HERE- IN THE ASSEMBLY AND- I THINK REALLY EXPLAIN THE CONCEPT OF SOCIAL HOUSING IS CRITICAL WE NEED NEW OR DIFFERENT BOLDER IDEAS- TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING CRISIS- I WELCOME THIS IDEA I'M EXCITED TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. OUT OF COMMITTEE AND BUT PLEDGE TO WORK WITH YOU AS IT GOES THROUGH THE PROCESS- AND YOU KNOW I THINK THERE ARE AYE AYE HERE I MISS QUIRK-SILVA AS CONCERNS AROUND THIS WHICH I THINK WE DO NEED TO ADDRESS IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION HOW THIS CAN LOOK BUT CERTAINLY WANT TO MOVE IT OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY SO THAT WE CAN KEEP HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND SO WITH THAT A LET YOU CLOSE. THANK YOU SO MUCH I APPRECIATE THE ROBUST CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS YOU KNOW I THINK. THIS SUMMER QUIRK-SILVA DOES BRING ABOUT CONCERNS ABOUT IT. AND THIS IS KIND OF THE GRAND VISION AND I THINK THE FIRST STEP IN ACHIEVING SOCIAL HOUSING IS WE HAVE TO CREATE THE FRAMEWORK FIRST. AND THEN IN THE LARGER STRATEGY DESCRIBING. ITSELF TO GO OUT FOR BOND AND HOPEFULLY GO OUT FOR ALL THESE OTHER MEASURES TO IT BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE SEVEN I'VE ALWAYS BEEN VERY TRANSPARENT THERE ONE THAT I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST. IN A SERIES OF ORDER OF OPERATIONS. AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE REPLICATE. NOT JUST SO WE SEE THE POSTER CHILD IN VIENNA AND IN EUROPE BUT ALSO LOOK AT ASIA WHICH WE DO INCORPORATE SOME OF THESE IN SINGAPORE AS WELL- BECAUSE THESE MODELS HAVE EXISTED- JUST AS LONG AS THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENT US PUBLIC HOUSING HAS EXISTED IF NOT LONGER. AND THERE IS A REASON PARTICULAR REASONS WHY WE IN THIS COUNTRY FAILED. AND HOW THAT'S RACISM. AND APART AND WHY YOU KNOW OTHER PLACES THEY SUCCEEDED WHICH IS JUST AS LONG. AND IF WE LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES THIS COUNTRY TO MAKE A SUSTAINABLE TO MAKE THEM BEAUTIFUL MAKE THE MIXING COMING NOT CONCENTRATION POVERTY AND MAKE THEM AS- OPPORTUNITIES FOR MY FOLKS. AND WE CAN BUILD MORE HOUSING THAT'S NOT JUST FOR PROFIT BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. IN OUR BEST INTENTIONS WE ONLY HAVE TO RELY ON THE PRIVATE MARKET AS THE MAJORITY WERE HOUSING AND THEY ALWAYS DO IT. WITH A PROFIT MARGIN AND THAT'S JUST THAT'S JUST NATURE OF THE GAME RIGHT. BUT IF WE CAN BUILD HOUSING IS A PUBLIC COULD. AND THAT MONEY GETS RECYCLED BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY TO OUR WORKERS ARE RESIDENTS. THAT'S HOW WE'RE GONNA CHIEF THIS. AND YOU KNOW I'VE I THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME BRING THESE POSTERS BUT I ALWAYS LIKE I SAID AT THE BEGINNING AS I DON'T. LIKE TO VISUALIZE SUCCESS. WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THINGS CAN LOOK SCARY SEEMS SCARY AND WE HAVE IDEAS ABOUT WHAT PROJECTS ARE. BUT THEY'RE CLEARLY EXAMPLES THAT IN THIS COUNTRY UNITED STATES OR IN EUROPE. THEY DO A FINE AGE OF BEAUTIFUL AND YOU TRAVEL THOUSANDS OF MILES GO LOOK AT THEM. AND YOU WANT TO LIVE IN THEM AND THERE'S NO REASON WE CAN'T THIS COUNTRY SO. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY AND THANK THE CHAIR FOR YOUR WORK ON THE SELECT COMMITTEE AS WELL. WITHOUT THE MOTIONS TO PASS THROUGH SOME LOOKED INTO PREPARATIONS. WICKS I WEEKS I'D SAY OCTOBER NOTES HERE TO KNOW CARILLO. I GABRIEL. GABRIEL I KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY QUIRKS SILVA. QUIRK-SILVA WARD. WART BY. THANK YOU. AND THAT BILL IS OUT. NEXT WE WILL HAVE MISTER GALLAGHER COME JOIN US PLEASE. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. YEAH YEAH WE NEED TO DO MY- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN CHAIRWOMAN SARAH TWENTY ONE THIRTY NINE. AND I WANT TO START OFF BY THINKING- THE CHAIRWOMAN AND HER STAFF FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THE AMENDMENTS TO THIS BILL. AND I AM ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY NINE WOULD HELP STREAMLINE THE REBUILD PROCESS IN AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY DISASTERS LIKE WILDFIRES- THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCE TOO MUCH HERE LATELY IN CALIFORNIA- THE CAMPFIRE AS YOU KNOW IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN DISPLAYS FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE AND DESTROYED ALMOST TWENTY THOUSAND STRUCTURES. IN AN EFFORT TO REBUILD THEIR pCOMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS LIKE REBUILD PARADISE HAVE CREATED A RESIDENTIAL FLOOR PLAN LIBRARY THAT CONTAINS TEMPLATE FLOOR PLANS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPROVED BY THE TOWN OF PARADISE AND BUTTE COUNTY. AND THE INCORPORATE THE MOST UPDATED BUILDING CODES- YOU KNOW ADDS THAT AT THE TIME AND I THINK THAT'S ONE THING IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS BILL AS YOU KNOW AS WERE AS WERE REBUILDING AND AN ENTIRE TOWN- BECAUSE PARADISE. YOU KNOW THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY. WHAT I LIKED OUT WE ARE WE ARE REBUILDING HEALTHCARE. UP TO THE YOU KNOW MOST. IN INCLUDING MOVIES STANDARDS- AND THESE TEMPLATES HELP ME THAT BUT THE THING IS THEY ACTUALLY REALLY HAVING THESE TEMPLATE FLOOR PLANS HELP SAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE REBUILDING ANYWHERE FROM 500-021-0000 DOLLARS- IN AN AVERAGE OF SIX MONTHS OF BUILDING TIME- SO FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DESPERATE TO GET BACK INTO A HOME. AND WHO NEED BEYOND WHO MEN HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES- YOU KNOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY STRUGGLING TO PUT TOGETHER- THE RESOURCES TO REBUILD AND YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THOSE STORIES AS WELL THIS IS JUST YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT CAN REALLY HELP AND IT WAS AN INNOVATIVE IDEA THAT WAS THAT WAS BROUGHT FORWARD- BY REBUILD PARADISE IN YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM THEM- DURING THIS. TESTIMONY TODAY- BUT THAT IS BUT THAT'S BEEN REALLY HELPFUL AND SO WE WANTED TO JUST PUT THAT IN THE CODE THAT WE CAN. BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THESE PLANS- AND THAT WE KNOW THE BUILDING CODE ALWAYS GETS UPDATED- AND THE PROBLEM IS WHEN THAT GETS UPDATED IN THESE THESE. THESE PLANS WILL BE OBSOLETE WELL WE'RE GOING TO BE BUILDING OVER THE NEXT TEN TO TWENTY YEARS- AND SO HAVING THESE YOU KNOW AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE. FOR A LONGER. PERIOD OF TIME WILL BE REALLY HELPFUL AND I'D ALSO NOTE THAT. PART OF WHAT IS BUILT INTO THE INTO THE- THE BILL WITH THE AMENDMENTS. IS IT NOW THAT- YOU KNOW LOCAL GOVERNMENT WOULD HAVE TO. CREATE A FINDING SAYING THAT THESE ARE CONSISTENT WITH. SAFETY STANDARDS AND WOULD NOT IMPACT. THE SAFETY YOU ABOVE BUT PROVING THESE PLANTS SO- I'D- REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF YOUR HELP IN MAKING THIS. A GREAT BILL AND I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A REALLY GREAT HELP- TO COMMUNITIES LIKE PARADISE AND OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY WILDFIRE. AND OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS SO I'D ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. ON AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY NINE. THANK YOU I'M CHEN GOOD LINE WITH THE REBUILD PARADISE FOUNDATION AND GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- HOPE IS BEING ABLE TO SEE THAT THERE IS LIGHT DESPITE ALL OF THE DARKNESS. I LIVE IN A TRAILER WITH MY FOUR CHILDREN AND HUSBAND AND PUPPY IN PARADISE CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE NO WASHING MACHINE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED POWER OUTAGES HAVE HAD MANY COLD NIGHTS TAKEN THREE MINUTE SHOWERS AND WE HOME SCHOOL OUR KIDS DURING CODED JUST LIKE THE REST OF YOU EXCEPT FOR IN A TRAILER. WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY OF OUR WATER IF WE CAN GET INSURANCE WHO'S GOING TO BUILD OUR HOUSE AND HOW THE HECK ARE WE GOING TO PAY FOR IT. WE'VE SPENT YEARS CLEANING DEAD TREES AND WEEDS FROM OUR PROPERTY. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED EVERY POSSIBLE HURDLE TO REBUILD. WE ARE NOT ALONE NOW. THIS IS THE STORY FOR MANY IN OUR COMMUNITY THOSE WHO LOST EVERYTHING WORKING TO REBUILD AND NOT GIVING UP. MY JOB IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE REBUILD PARADISE FOUNDATION IS TO ELIMINATE SOME OF THE HURDLES AND EXPENSES PEOPLE ARE FACING WHILE ALSO KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. WE HAVE DEVELOPED TWELVE MASTER FLOOR PLANS AND TO HELP REDUCE BOTH COST AND TIME FOR RESIDENTS. OUR PROGRAM HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL THAT TO NONPROFITS HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AND HOPE CRISIS RESPONSE NETWORK ARE USING THESE PLANS. OVER HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE PERMITS HAVE BEEN ISSUED FROM THESE MASTER PLANS WITH MANY OF THOSE HOMES BUILT TO COMPLETION. ON AVERAGE THIS IS SAVING PEOPLE FROM SEVEN TO TWELVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND SIX MONTHS OF TIME. CAN YOU IMAGINE SIX MONTHS LESS LIVING IN A TRAILER. THE UPCOMING BILLING CODE WILL BE ANOTHER STRAIN ON OUR COMMUNITY CAUSING EACH MASTER PLAN WE HAVE TO BE UPDATED BY THE DESIGN PROFESSIONALS THE TOWN OF PARADISE AND YOU COUNTY. THIS UPDATE WILL HAVE A RIPPLE EFFECT NOT ONLY WILL IT TAKE TIME MONEY AND THE USE OF OUR ALREADY DEPLETED RESOURCES. BUT THE UPDATE UPDATES ARE GOING TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL COSTS FOR THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY SCRAPING PENNIES TOGETHER TO REBUILD. I DO VALUE BUILDING CODE UPDATES AND KEEPING UP WITH INDUSTRY STANDARDS BUT THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS UPCOMING COULD CYCLE TO SAY THAT A HOUSE BILL THIS YEAR WILL BE ANY LESS SAFE AND ONE NEXT YEAR. IT WILL JUST BE MORE EXPENSIVE. STUDIES ALSO SHOW THAT MEDITATION AROUND HOME PLATE THE BIGGEST. IMPACT ON THE SURVIVAL IN A FIRE. AND IF SAFETY WAS TRULY CONCERNED. THEN MANUFACTURED HOMES WHICH MAKE UP ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR REBUILDS SHOULD HAVE TO LIVE UP TO THE SAME SAFETY STANDARDS. WE HAVE HAD THE STATE'S LARGEST AND MOST DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRE. FOLLOWED BY COVE IN NINETEEN AND SOARING BUILDING CRISIS. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY OR KEEPING OUR FOUNDATIONS PLANTS THIS ISN'T EVEN JUST ABOUT PARADISE. THIS IS ABOUT OUR COUNTY AND STATE HAVING AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WINDY YOU STATED THAT YOU DON'T HAVE A LAND WHERE YOU LIVE GUESS WHERE THERE'S LOTS OF LAND TO BUILD IN PARADISE. SO MUCH OPPORTUNITY THERE. ONE LESS HURDLE ONE AT LESS EXPENSE IS ALL THAT PEOPLE NEED TO COME HOME PLEASE SUPPORT AB TWO ONE. THREE NINE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

HIGHLIFE HIGHLAND HOMES IS A NATIONAL HOMEBUILDER SPECIALIZING IN STICK BUILT CONSTRUCTION IN THE NORTHWEST. ONE OF THE FOURTH PLANS THEY OFFER IS A MODEST TWELVE HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT SQUARE FOOT HOME. THE WASHINGTON IT WILL COST YOU A HUNDRED FORTY NINE DOLLARS PER SQUARE FOOT TO CONSTRUCT BACK HOME. IN IDAHO THE COST IS A HUNDRED AND SIXTY FOUR PER SQUARE FOOT. AN OREGON UNDER THE SEVENTY NINE AND CALIFORNIA THAT SAME HOME COST TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ONE DOLLARS A SQUARE FOOT TO CONSTRUCT. IT COSTS AT LEAST NINETY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE TO BUILD A MODEST SIZE HOME WITH THE SAME ENTRY LEVEL FINISHES IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF OUR BUILDING CODES. WE LIKE TO USE THE TERM ELECTRIFICATION CALIFORNIA'S WELL IN IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO ENERGY CODES ARE CERTAINLY PUSHING TOWARDS THAT. AND YOU COUNTY PARTICULARLY WHEN YOUR REBUILDING A HOME FOR CAMPFIRE SURVIVOR. YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW TOTAL DEPENDENCY ON THE GRID IN PG&amp;E HAS RECEIVED. MANY WANTING TO REBUILD THE SAME OR VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT THEY HAD BEFORE THE FIRE. MANY PREFERRED. PER FOR GAS APPLIANCES. TO DO THIS UNDER THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO CODES THEY WOULD NEED TO BUILD AS IF THEY WERE INSTALLING ELECTRIC APPLIANCES. IT'S MEANS NOT ONLY PULLING THE WIRE AND INSTALLING TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR. A TWO HUNDRED TWENTY WILL CONDUCT. CONDUCT CIRCUIT SORRY. BUT ALSO UPGRADING A HUNDRED AMP PANEL TO A TWO HUNDRED AMP PANEL WHICH ADDS SIGNIFICANT COSTS. REBUILDING A RULE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES. ALREADY HAS MANY COST BARRIERS INCLUDING REMOVAL OF BURNT TREES REPLACEMENT OF WELLS AND SEPTIC SYSTEMS. AND ENGINEERED FOUNDATIONS BEFORE WE CAN EVEN GET OUT OF THE GROUND. FOR MANY PRE APPROVED MASTER PLAN SO THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN AFFORD TO REBUILD. THE TOWN OF PARADISE HAS SIXTY FIVE APPROVED MASTER PLANS WITH NINE MORE CURRENTLY IN PLAN REVIEW. IT'S NOT ONLY THE COST TO UPDATE. AND CALIFORNIA'S BUILDING CODES ARE ALREADY THE SAFEST MOST ENERGY CONSCIOUS IN THE UNITED STATES BY FAR. PLEASE ALLOW AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY NINE TO MOVE FORWARD AND BECOME LAW. FOR MANY THESE EXCEPTIONS WILL BE THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN AFFORD TO REBUILD AND RETURN HOME. THANK YOU.

BUT YOU GET STUCK IN THE MORASS OF REGULATORY THINGS THAT WE'VE CREATED THAT IS CAUSING ARE HOMELESS ARE NOT ARE HOMELESS BUT OUR- AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS BECAUSE IT'S A SUPPLY AND DEMAND PROBLEM AND WE ARE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE IN THE SUPPLY SIDE AND NOW WE'VE TAKEN PEOPLE WHO HAD SUPPLY TAKING THEM OUT AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE THEM GO THROUGH THAT SAME PROCESS THAT HAS CREATED. THE DISASTER THAT IS CALIFORNIA HOUSING AND- ASIDE FROM ENSURING THAT. MAYBE WHEN IT THINGS A REBUILT- THAT. IT HAS MORE PROTECTIONS FROM BURNING DOWN AGAIN- YOU KNOW PEOPLE NEED TO BE ABLE DATE TO GET BACK INTO WHAT THEY HAD AND IT'S NOT FAIR FOR US IN A YOU KNOW THE GOVERNMENT TO IMPOSE REGULATIONS ON PEOPLE. WHEN THE WHEN THEY ALREADY HAD A HOUSE WHEN THEY WERE ALREADY LIVING THE WAY THEY WERE GOING TO LIVE AND- AND- IT YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID ASIDE FROM HAVING A FIRE COME THROUGH AGAIN- MAYBE YOU KNOW SOME HOME HARDENING IN AND CLEARANCE- BEING ADDED IN THE REST OF THE REGULATIONS NEED TO BE SET ASIDE- SO THAT PEOPLE CAN REGAIN WHAT THEY HAD BEFORE THEY STARTED. AND SO I APPLAUD THE EFFORTS ON YOUR PART TO HELP PEOPLE GET THROUGH THAT SO ARE THERE NOT MORE CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS. HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. THANK THANK YOU MISTER SERTOMA ESTHER WARD THE COMBINATION ON ON THIS WORK- PARTICULARLY AS IT- YOU KNOW HAS- SO- HORRIBLY AFFECTED YOUR COMMUNITIES AND YOUR DISTRICT- BIG FAN GENERALLY OF USING TEMPLATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR A VARIETY OF HOUSING SOLUTIONS SO- IT MAKES ALL THE SENSE IN THE WORLD THAT IT COULD BE APPLIED HERE- AND- I WOULD ALSO- HOPE THAT YOU'RE GIVEN THE STATE OF WHAT.

SHOULD YOU WORK IN THE SPACE MORE BROADLY I'D ALSO LOVE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR AND WOULD WANT TO BE HELPFUL IN ANY WAY SHAPE I CAN TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD THROUGHOUT THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY.

AND ENSURING PROTECTION FOR THOSE THOSE COMMUNITIES- BUT I THINK PROVIDING THIS TEMPLATE JUST GIVE IT IT STREAMLINES A LOT OF COST AND TIME. AND THAT'S REALLY HELPFUL AS WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE THE HOUSING CRISIS AND TRYING TO HELP COMMUNITIES LIKE PARADISE RECOVER SO THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOUR HELP MADAM CHAIR AND WILL CONTINUE TO. TO WORK ON THIS AND MANY OTHER ITEMS THANK YOU THANK YOU RANDY AND MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED. WICKS HI WICKS I SEYARTO C. R. DI KOREA. KOREA I GABRIEL. HI GABRIEL I KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY. QUIRK-SILVA WARD. I AND THAT BILL IS OUT THANK YOU THANK YOU. NOW WE HAVE MISTER BLOOM WHO HAS TWO BILLS IN FRONT OF US WHEN WE START WITH AB TWENTY TWO NINETY FIVE IS THAT RIGHT. YES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AND- OF COURSE MANAGER WANT TO THANK- YOUR STAFF FOR- THE- TYPICAL HIGH QUALITY OF THEIR WORK ON THE BILL AND- I WILL BE ACCEPTING ALL OF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THIS MORNING. CALIFORNIA'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IS EXACERBATING ANOTHER URGENT CRISIS TEACHER SHORTAGES RECENT DATA SHOWS THAT ONE IN TEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE LOSING- A QUARTER OF THEIR TEACHERS. SKYROCKETING HOUSING PRICES AND STAGNANT SALARIES OF MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR TEACHERS TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY TEACH FURTHERMORE TEACHER SALARIES OFTEN HOVER ABOVE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING MAKING THEM UNQUALIFIED FOR SUBSIDIZED HOUSING BUT- AT THE SAME TIME UNABLE TO COMPETE FOR MARKET RATE APARTMENTS. WE CAN DO BETTER. FORTY SIX OF THE LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE EXPRESSED INTEREST IN BUILDING EDUCATIONAL WORKFORCE HOUSING TO ADDRESS TEACHER SHORTAGES AND RETAIN STAFF AND I BELIEVE YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR AN ARM AND A MOMENT THAT THAT NUMBER IS ACTUALLY GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY UNFORTUNATELY LOCAL RESISTANCE COMPLICATED BUREAUCRATIC PROCESSES AND RESTRICTIVE ZONING HAVE ADDED CHALLENGES TO HOUSING CONSTRUCTION ON DISTRICT OWNED PROPERTIES THAT ARE OTHERWISE GOING UNUTILIZED. ONLY ARE UNDER UTILIZED AND ONLY TWO SCHOOL DISTRICTS SANTA CLARA UNIFIED IN LA UNIFIED HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY BUILD HOUSING PROJECTS ON PROPERTIES THAT THEY OWN IN SPITE OF THIS INTENSE INTEREST IN DOING SO. BOTH DISTRICTS REPORTED STRONG INTEREST IN THESE UNITS BY BOTH TEACHERS AND STAFF BUT ALSO REPORTED CHALLENGES AND DELAYS IN GETTING THEIR PROJECTS OFF THE GROUND AB TWENTY TWO NINETY FIVE WILL MOVE THE BARRIERS THAT HAVE HINDERED HOUSING PRODUCTION FOR TEACHERS. AND I AM THE ON THE SITES THE MEASURE WOULD MAKE HOUSING AND ALLOW- USED ALLOWABLE USE ON PROPERTIES SCHOOL DISTRICTS OWN IF THE PROJECTS MEET CERTAIN OBJECTIVE STANDARDS. AB TWENTY TWO NINETY FIVE REQUIRE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO PRIORITIZE TEACHERS AND SCHOOL STAFF FOR THESE UNITS AND ENSURES THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS WILL RETAIN THE PROPERTY. BY EASING THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND BUREAUCRATIC HURDLES AB TWENTY TWO NINETY FIVE WILL HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS CONSTRUCT ENOUGH HOUSING TO MEET THE CURRENT DEMAND ADDRESS TEACHING SHORTAGES AND HELP KEEP QUALITY TEACHERS AND STAFF IN THE CLASSROOM. IT'S A TRUE TRIPLE WIN WITH ME TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY IS DANA CUFF WHO IS THE DIRECTOR OF CITY LAB AT UCLA GO BRUINS. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY IN BLOOM- AND THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE AND YOUR STAFFS FOR ALL THE HELP THEY'VE GIVEN US AS WE SHAPE THIS BILL. I'M I'M A PROFESSOR OF ARCHITECTURE AND URBAN PLANNING AT UCLA AND I'M ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF THE DESIGN RESEARCH CENTER CALLED CITY LAB. IT'S IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR COLLEAGUES UP AT BERKELEY AND THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION WITH ITS ONE THOUSAND DISTRICTS THAT WE HAVE. BEEN STUDYING THE NEED FOR EDUCATION WORKFORCE HOUSING FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS. ON A PERSONAL NOTE I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M A PRODUCT OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS FROM KINDERGARTEN THROUGH MY PHD. AND I FEEL REAL COMMITMENT TO TRYING TO MAKE SURE OUR TEACHERS AND CAFETERIA WORKERS JANITORS ARE WELL HOUSE WHEN THEY'RE SERVING THE FUTURE OF THE STATE. I AM SURE ALL DAY YOU HEAR. MORE AND MORE STATISTICS ABOUT THE HOUSING CRISIS BUT LET ME ADD ONE MORE. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PRICES WENT UP TWELVE POINT THREE PERCENT. ALMOST DOUBLE THAT RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO WHICH IS SIMILAR TO OTHER SMALL METRO AREAS. BUT TEACHERS SALARIES BY CONTRAST WENT UP ONE POINT SIX PERCENT. THIS MEANS THAT THEY ARE INCREASINGLY UNABLE TO AFFORD THE HOUSING THEY NEED TO SERVE THEIR DISTRICTS AND TO LIVE NEAR THEIR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AND JOBS- THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION THEN IS AN INCREASINGLY SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH 75% OF CALIFORNIA DISTRICTS REPORTING PROBLEMS WITH RECRUITMENT. ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS THAT CALIFORNIA TEACHERS- GIVE FOR LEAVING OUR STATE IS THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING AND THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR ENTRY LEVEL TEACHERS AND IF IT'S TRUE FOR ENTRY LEVEL TEACHERS. YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW UNATTAINABLE HOUSING IS FOR THE CLASSIFIED STAFF WHO KEEP OUR SCHOOLS RUNNING JANITORS AIDES SECRETARIES AND CAFETERIA WORKERS. IN OUR RESEARCH WE FOUND THAT THERE ARE ELEVEN THOUSAND ALMOST DISTRICT OWNED PROPERTIES. THAT'S UP A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES AND EIGHTY THOUSAND OF THOSE ARE ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY DEVELOPER WILL LANDS- THAT'S TE SIZE OF SIX MANHATTAN'S AND WHEN WE LOOK FOR SPACE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THAT'S THE IMPORTANT RESOURCE THAT WE SHOULD BE TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION. AS ASSEMBLYMAN BLOOM SAID WILL BE TO DISTRICTS HAVE MANAGED TO DO THIS THUS FAR THEY BUILT FOR DEVELOPMENTS ALL TOGETHER THREE IN LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND ONE IN SANTA CLARA. AND ALL OF THOSE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS HAVE WAITING LISTS THERE TWO MORE UNDER WAY AT BERKELEY AND SAN JOSE. JUST THIS PAST WEEK AS WE'VE BEEN ORGANIZING OUT OF OUR BERKELEY AND UCLA CENTERS. OF THE WORKSHOPS TO TRAIN SCHOOL DISTRICTS HOW TO BUILD THESE WE RECEIVED. FIFTY ENQUIRIES WHEN WE WERE HOPING FOR FIVE SO THERE'S NEW DEMAND FOR THIS THAT'S REALLY OVERWHELMING AND- A LOT OF THIS COMES FROM THE FACT. THAT IT TAKES SEVEN TO NINE YEARS TO MOVE THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS THAT'S UP THREE SEPARATE SCHOOL BOARDS GIVEN THE TERMS THAT THEY SERVE. I'M FORTY SIX DISTRICTS HAVE TRIED TO BUILD THIS KIND OF HOUSING. OKAY I'M AND HAVE NOT YET BEEN SUCCESSFUL- AND SO THE AB TWENTY TWO NINETY FIVE WILL REMOVE THE BARRIERS WHILE KEEPING LOCAL OBJECTIVE PLANNING REVIEW AND TO COULD CUT THE TIME LINE VIRTUALLY IN HALF- UP WE'VE- WILL ALLOW BY PERMITS HOUSING ON ALL SCHOOL OWNED PROPERTY. AND OTHER TIME CONSUMING AND COMPLICATED PROCESS SEES WILL BE REMOVED 20% OF THE HOUSING WOULD BE AFFORDABLE AT MODERATE LEVELS COULD EXCEED THAT AS DISTRICTS CHOOSE WITH FIFTY FIVE YEARS GUARANTEED AFFORDABILITY. WITH THIS HOUSING CALIFORNIA'S EDUCATION STAFF AND CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN BASICALLY OUR FUTURE WILL BE STABILIZE AND QUALITY EDUCATION BETTER IN CHURCH THANK YOU.

GIVE THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO USE THEIR LAND IN A WAY THAT IS PRODUCTIVE AND HELPFUL- YOU KNOW IT WE HAVE TALKED A LOT ABOUT HOW WE NEED AND ALL OF THE ABOVE SOLUTION AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT EVERY UP POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY AND I THINK THIS IS FITS SQUARELY WITHIN NOT SO I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BEING A BILL FOR HAPPY TO SUPPORT DAY AND LOOK FOR TO TALKING WITH YOU ABOUT IT.

WELL YEAH GREAT SURE MR GABRIEL OKAY BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD FOR WORKING WITH UR STAFF FOR MAKING THIS BILL STRONG APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP IN THE SPACE IT'S OBVIOUSLY I THINK TOUCH ON A CRITICAL ISSUE I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY- SENSIBLY THE MOTION SECOND AND WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ABBOTT THANK YOU. GREAT THANK YOU AND THE BILL IS THE MOTION IS. YOU PASSAGE. DO PASSES AMENDED TO LOCAL GOV. WICKS I MEAN I ARE DON'T KNOW THEIR TO KNOW CARILLO. I GABRIEL HI GABRIEL I KALRA COLOR I KILEY QUIRK-SILVA WARD. WHAT BY. THAT BILLS OUT AND FEEL LIKE TO GO TO YOUR NEXT BILL THANK YOU AB TWENTY TWO THIRTY NINE EXACTLY CURRENT LAW REQUIRES- THAT JURISDICTION'S IDENTIFY AT LEAST ONE'S OWN WITHIN THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT WHERE EMERGENCY SHELTERS ARE PERMITTED BY RIGHT. THE LAW HOWEVER DOES NOT REQUIRE THE JURISDICTION TO DEMONSTRATE SITES WITHIN THAT ZONE ARE SUITABLE AND AVAILABLE FOR SHELTER DEVELOPMENT OR HAVE THE CAPACITY TO MEET THE NEED. AND THE RESULT IS THAT MANY JURISDICTIONS ARE NOT ADEQUATELY PLANNING FOR SHELTERS OR OTHER INTERIM HOUSING AND EVEN CREATING BARRIERS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF EMERGENCY SHELTERS FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. IN ADDITION CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT IF A JURISDICTION FAILED TO REZONE ENOUGH LAND TO MEET ITS RAINY AT ALL INCOME LEVELS DURING THE PRIOR HOUSING ELEMENT PERIOD IT MUST MAKE UP THIS ONLY SHORTFALL IN ITS SUBSEQUENT HOUSING ELEMENT. THE SITE'S REZONED TO MAKE UP THE SHORTFALL FROM THE PRIOR HOUSING ELEMENT ARE KNOWN AS CARRY OVER SITES. THERE IS SOME AMBIGUITY IN THE LAW AS TO WHETHER THE STATE'S NO NET LOSS ZONING LAW APPLIES TO BOTH CARRY OVER SITES AND SITES TO MEET THE CURRENT RENO OBLIGATION. AS A RESULT SOME LOCALITIES MAY NOT COMPLY WITH THE OBLIGATION TO REPLACE CARRY OVER SITES THAT ARE DEVELOPED WITHOUT HOUSING FOR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. FURTHER CONSTRAINING THE SUPPLY BADLY NEEDED SITES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AB TWENTY THREE THIRTY NINE WOULD STRENGTHEN HOUSING ELEMENT LAW TO ENSURE THAT ZONES IDENTIFIED AS LOCATIONS WHERE SHELTERS AND OTHER INTERIM HOUSING SOLUTIONS CAN BE BUILT BY RIGHT. ARE SUITABLE- AT AVAILABLE AND SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THE NEED FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. FINALLY THE BILL WOULD CLARIFY THAT NO NET LOSS LAW APPLIES TO BOTH CARRY OVER SITES AND SITES IDENTIFIED TO MEET THE CURRENT RAIN. THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND WITH ME TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY IS ON THE LAWLER REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION AND THE PUBLIC INTEREST LAW PROJECT. GOOD MORNING MY NUMBER IS ON THE ALERT AGAIN ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST LAW PROJECT IN THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION TO THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL- I THINK MR BLOOM COVERED IT WELL- WE LONG HAD A REQUIREMENT THAT. CITIES AND COUNTIES HAVE ZONE AS A ZONE OR ZONES WHERE MARGINS THE SHELTERS LIBRARY NAVIGATION SOLDIERS AND OTHER INTERIM HAVING USES CAN LOCATE BY RIGHT- AND FRANKLY MOST RESTRICTIONS ACTUALLY DO A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF COMPLYING WITH THIS LAW HOWEVER. THERE IS A SUBSET OF- IN JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE DESIGNATED SITES WHERE SOLDIERS CAN LOCATE BY RIGHT WHERE THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO SITES THAT ARE ADEQUATE OR AVAILABLE OR APPROPRIATE FOR LOOKING EMERGENCY SHELTER WHICH IS NOT REALLY COMPLYING WITH THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW WHICH IS REALLY INTENDED TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SHELTER DEVELOPMENT. FOR EXAMPLE DESIGNATED DESIGNATING A HEAVY INDUSTRIAL ZONE AS A PLACE FOR A SHELTER WHICH IS NOT APPROPRIATE- FOR HUMAN HABITATION FRANKLY SO WE'RE REALLY JUST TRYING TO ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE TEETH A LOT OF MAKE SURE WE GET ACTUAL SITES WHERE SOLDIERS CAN LOCATE- SO THAT WE CAN CREATE THESE IN TERM HOUSING SOLUTIONS THAT I THINK WE- ALL KNOW WE DESPERATELY NEED AND WITH THAT WE ARE TRY VOTE.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO- I'M SORRY- TO CLOSE AND AYE- AYE THIS MAY BE- AFTER TEN YEARS THE LAST TIME THAT I APPEAR IN THIS COMMITTEE- NO I'M SO SORRY MR BILLS EVERY YEAR FOR TEN YEARS AND WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS JUST EXPRESS MY ADMIRATION FOR THE- IMPORTANT WORK THAT'S DONE BY THIS COMMITTEE AND PARTICULARLY.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES I AM PLEASED TODAY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN SIXTY ONE- AS WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS COMMITTEE CALIFORNIA HAS A WELL DOCUMENTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS AND ONE OF THE PARTICULARLY UNFORTUNATE RESULTS OF THAT CRISIS IS THAT SO MANY OF OUR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS FACE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO FINDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING- THAT OFTEN MEANS A PROTECTIVE SENTENCE MIGHT SUBMIT PAPER APPLICATIONS FOR EACH UNIT THEY'RE APPLYING TO EVEN WHEN THEY ARE OWNED AND OPERATED BY THE SAME ENTITY. AS A RESULT OF THIS THEY CAN BE DIFFICULT AND TIME CONSUMING AND COSTLY FOR LOW INCOME TENANTS TO FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING THEY OFTEN HAVE TO FOREGO SCHOOL OR WORK AS PART OF THAT SEARCH AND SO IT SIMPLY BILL NINETEEN SIXTY ONE WOULD ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY REQUIRING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT HOUSING COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT TO CREATE AND IMPLEMENT A STATEWIDE DATABASE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING LISTINGS THIS PORTER WOULD BENEFIT LOW INCOME APPLICANTS IN PROPERTY MANAGERS IN MATH AND IT'S STREAMLINING LOCATIONS AND SCREENINGS AND PROVIDING AN UPDATED LIST OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. THIS PORTAL WOULD ENSURE THE TENANTS CAN VIEW AVAILABLE PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED AFFORDABLE HOUSING LISTING CEMENT RENTAL APPLICATIONS ELECTRONICALLY ACCESS THE DATABASE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES AND ALSO STORE THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR RE USE SO THAT THEY CAN APPLY FOR MULTIPLE LISTINGS IN A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT AND STREAMLINED FASHION WE'RE GOING TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY AND I ALSO WANT TO ADD MY- THANKS AND ECHO ALL THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE VERY VERY THOUGHTFUL DISTANCE OF THE STAFF- IN THE CHAIR IN THE COMMITTEE SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP THERE- AND WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME.

THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA JUST HOW CHALLENGING IT IS FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. INCLUDING PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TO AFFORD MODEST HOUSING. OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE MINISTRATION HAVE TAKEN MEASURABLE STEPS TO SPEED THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BY INCREASING FUNDING TO STATE PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT. BY IMPROVING ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES TO ENSURE JURISDICTIONS MEET THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEEDS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND BY STREAMLINING THE PROCESS FOR DEVELOPERS APPLYING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING JUST TO NAME A FEW. AND THE STRATEGIES WILL CONTINUE TO BE CRITICAL TO SOLVING OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS. AB NINETEEN SIXTY ONE AT ITS CORE REINFORCES THE GOOD WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES BY MAKING IT EASIER FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. TO FIND THE HOUSING THAT WE ARE WORKING SO HARD TO PRODUCE AND KEEP AFFORDABLE. THIS BILL PROPOSES TO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. DEPARTMENT TRANSFORMATION. DIGITAL TOOL THAT WILL ALLOW SOMEONE LOOKING FOR DEED RESTRICTED MULTI FAMILY AFFORDABLE HOUSING. TO CREATE A USER PROFILE THAT CENTRALIZES THEIR PERSONAL. YOU IN APPLY TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR BE PLACED ON A WAIT LIST ENTIRELY ONLINE.

AS YOU WILL HEAR FROM MISTER WILLIE STEVENS IN A MOMENT. WHEN IT COMES TO FINDING AND APPLYING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THE STATUS QUO IS TOO UNWIELDY AND TOO CUMBERSOME.

LOCAL AGENCIES OR OTHERS THAT ARE ALREADY DOING THIS WITH THEIR HOUSING STOCK ONE ON THAT AND THEY ARE RECEIVING THE FUNDING TO PROPERLY TRAIN YOUR BECOME FAMILIAR WITH- NEW PLATFORMS- INTO THAT THERE IS- AN ACTIVE WAY FOR. THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS TALK TO EACH OTHER THEY HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITIES TODAY TO MANAGE OR TO KNOW THEIR HOUSING STOCK TO ACCEPT THE APPLICATIONS IN JURISDICTIONS LIKE MINE YOU KNOW THAT'S ALREADY EIGHT TO TEN YEARS LONG- WHEN YOU DO QUALIFY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF HOUSING AND THEN YOU'RE YOU'RE WAITING THAT LONG TO ACTUALLY WE FOR THAT YOU NEED TO OPEN UP- I. WOULD HOPE THIS AYE AYE AYE UNDERTAKEN THERE'S VALUE HERE I HOPE THAT- WHAT WE NEED TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE NEED THIS DATABASE CERTAINLY TO GROW IN NUMBERS- BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF- YOU KNOW POTENTIAL RESIDENTS ARE GOING TO LOOK UP THAT THEY'RE GOING TO SUBMIT THE APPLICATION. AND REALIZE THAT THE NEAREST AVAILABLE PLACE MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO ARE MILES AWAY- BUT- YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS IS- HELPING US REALLY LOOK AT THE ENTIRE MAP- AND HELP AREAS AND HELP JURISDICTIONS THAT. ARE UP TO SPEED- LIKE MINE WITH THE- CATALOGING AND THE- AUTOMATION- THIS INFORMATION CAN BE REALLY HELPFUL SO THANK YOU.

GREAT THANK YOU AND THE MOTION IS THAT DO PASSED AS AMENDED TO THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. WICKS I WEEKS I SEYARTO HI I CORREO. HI GABRIEL HI GABRIEL I QUIRK-SILVA A WARD WARD BY. THE BILL OUT. AND I JUST WHEN REMIND FOLKS WE'VE GOT ONE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE SIX MORE BILLS AND WE HAVE TO BE OUT OF THIS ROOM AT ONE O'CLOCK SO IF- BILLS HAVE LESS CONTROVERSY LET'S MOVE RIGHT ALONG OKAY. MYSTERY THIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I WANT TO START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS AS DESCRIBED ON PAGE EIGHT OF THE ANALYSIS AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY FIVE BUILT OFF RECENT LEGISLATION PROMOTING SYSTEMS INTEGRATION TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS IN COMBATING HOMELESSNESS. THE BILL WILL ESTABLISH A DIRECTOR WILL BE TASKED WITH OVERSEEING ALL STATE HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE MANAGED BY EXISTING ENTITIES. ADDITIONALLY AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY FIVE WILL CREATE A FUNDING WORK GROUP WHICH WILL BE TASKED WITH ALIGNING DEFINITIONS AND STREAMLINING PROGRAMS WHERE POSSIBLE. CONNECTING INDIVIDUALS- EXITING STATE FUNDED INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS LIKE PRISONS HOSPITALS AND NURSING HOMES TO HOUSING. IMPLEMENTING A UNIVERSAL APPLICATION FOR SERVICE AND HOUSING PROVIDERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. HOMELESSNESS IS ONE OF IF NOT THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES FACING OUR STATE TODAY AND THAT PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED EXACERBATED THE CRISIS TO NEW DANGEROUS LEVELS. THE L. A. O. THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION AND AT THE STATE AUDITOR HAVE ALL REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION REGARDING THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS OUR CURRENT. APPROACH IS UNNECESSARILY FRAGMENTED SERVICE PROVIDERS AND LOCALITIES FACE TREMENDOUS ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS AND NAVIGATING AT LEAST TEN STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS ADMINISTERS ADMINISTRATING THIRTY OR MORE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS RELATED TO HOMELESSNESS. THE DIFFERENT AND OFTEN CONFLICTING HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS APPLICATIONS AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS ARE UNNECESSARILY COMPLICATED AND LEADS TO DELAYS RESULTING IN INDIVIDUALS FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS. WE HAVE INVESTED A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RESOURCES INTO COMBATTING HOMELESSNESS BUT FUNDING ALONE WILL NOT SOLVE THE SYSTEMIC ISSUES WE NEED POLICY SOLUTIONS THAT WILL STREAMLINE SERVICE DELIVERY AND BREAK DOWN THE EXISTING SILOS BETWEEN OUR DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES. FUNDING INVESTMENTS MUST BE COUPLED WITH SOLUTIONS TO OUR STRUCTURAL ISSUES AT THE STATE LEVEL. TODAY I HAVE WITH ME TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY MARI KISSED ALL THE SENIOR LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE ON HOMELESSNESS FROM HOUSING CALIFORNIA AND SHARON REPORT DIRECTOR OF CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. THANK YOU THANK YOU MEMBERS I MARKET STALL THE SENIOR LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE ON HOMELESSNESS IT HOUSING CALIFORNIA NONPROFIT ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO AND LISTEN IT'S AN ASSURING EVERYONE HAS AN AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE- AS A FAMILY MEMBER RIVAS MENTION HOMELESSNESS IS A- PRESSING CRISIS IN OUR STATE AND RECENT POLLING SHOWS THAT AS MANY AS TWO THIRDS OF VOTERS ARE DISSATISFIED WITH OUR STATE'S HOMELESS RESPONSE. AND ITS STAND ABOVE THE PUBLIC MAYBE CAN APPRECIATE THE STATE'S STRATEGY IT'S HARD EVEN FOR SERVICE PROVIDERS AND LOCALITY. THE THIRTY PLUS PROGRAMS TACKLING HOMELESSNESS SPENDING TEN STATE AGENCIES AND DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARD COORDINATION THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS IN DIFFERENT AGENCIES OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY FROM ONE ANOTHER AND THE COUNCIL HAS LIMITED AUTHORITY TO DIRECT AND COORDINATE ACROSS THOSE AGENCIES WHICH CREATES HUGE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDENS ON LOCALITIES TO NAVIGATE DIFFERENT AND OFTEN CONFLICTING FUNDING APPLICATIONS PROTOCOLS AND REPORTING FOR. US EIGHT TWENTY THREE TWENTY FIVE SIX TO BUILD ON RECENT EFFORTS BY CREATING A FUNDING WORK GROUP WITHIN THE INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS INCLUDING STAY. OF ALL STATE FUNDED HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS THE WORK GROW GROUP WOULD AS MENTIONED A LINE PROGRAMS AROUND A CORE SET OF EVIDENCE EVIDENCE BASED STANDARDS CREATE PROTOCOLS TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM EXITING STATE FUNDED INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS INTO HOMELESSNESS. ANALYZE CURRENT PROGRAMS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL AREAS OF OVERLAP OR DUPLICATION AND WORK TOWARD A SHARED FUNDING APPLICATION TO LOWER THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN ON LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS WERE GREATLY ENCOURAGED BY THE PROGRESS MADE- ON COORDINATING ARE HOMELESS RESPONSE THANKS IN NO SMALL PART TO THE TALENTED AND DEALT DEDICATED LEADERS AT THE INTERAGENCY COUNCIL. BUT ONE OF FURTHER BUILD ON THIS PROGRESS AND ENSURE FUNDING AND POLICY AROUND HOMELESSNESS IS COORDINATED STREAMLINED AND EFFECTIVE SO THAT EVERY TAXPAYER DOLLARS USED WISELY AND EVERY PROGRAM IS ADVANCING EVIDENCE BASED SOLUTIONS TO HOMELESSNESS. THANKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SHARON REPORT WITH THE CORPORATION FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING. OVER THE LAST TWENTY PLUS YEARS INDEPENDENT BODIES HAVE NOTED FLAWS IN THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS. THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION REPORTED THAT THE STATE HAS A SILENT RESPONSE FOR EACH AGENCY IMPLEMENTS THEIR OWN PROGRAMS WITH LITTLE OR NO COORDINATION OR COLLABORATION. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE SAID THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS IS FRAGMENTED AND LACKS VISION. THE STATE AUDITOR REPORTED THAT THE STATE'S RESPONSE TO HOMELESSNESS LACKS A COLLABORATIVE REPORT APPROACH. AND THE GOVERNOR'S TASK FORCE OF REGIONAL HOMELESS ADVISERS RECOMMENDED A SINGLE POINT OF AUTHORITY THAT REPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE GOVERNOR AND IS ANSWERABLE FOR OUTCOMES. MS BECAUSE STUDY WAS CORRECT THAT THE CALIFORNIA INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN REACHING OUT TO OTHER AGENCIES AND CREATING AN ACTION PLAN. LAST YEAR'S AB TWELVE TWENTY AT VANCE PROGRESS WITH ADDING THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AS ONE OF THE CHAIRS. HOWEVER MOST OF THAT WORK pCENTERS ON STEPS THE COUNCIL WILL DO RATHER THAN WHAT THE OTHER STATE AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS WILL DO TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY. IN FACT THE COUNSEL HAS NO AUTHORITY OF THE OTHER AGENCIES OR DEPARTMENTS OUTSIDE OF THE BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING AGENCY OR THE COUNCIL SETS. THE SECRETARY BCS AGE AND THE CALIFORNIA I. CH STAFF ARE DEDICATED. TO PROGRESS IN SOLVING HOMELESSNESS BUT THEY SIMPLY LACK AUTHORITY BOTH THEM BEING THE SINGLE LEAD IN THE STATE'S RESPONSE AND THEN MOVING OTHER AGENCIES AND DEPARTMENTS TO BREAK DOWN. THE SILOS THE FRAGMENTATION AND DUPLICATION OF EFFORT THAT HAS EXISTED FOR DECADES. TWENTY AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY FIVE WOULD EMPOWER THE CALIFORNIA I. CH BY MOVING IT TO AN OFFICE WITH THE DIRECTOR THAT REPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE GOVERNOR. THE DIRECTOR IN OFFICE WILL BE A SINGLE LEAD WITH BOTH AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY. IN THIS OFFICE WILL BE STAFFED BY CURRENT I C. H. STAFF SO TWENTY THREE TWENTY FIVE WOULD NOT CREATE A NEW PROGRAM OR ADD A REQUIRED TO HIRING OF ADDITIONAL STAFF. THIS APPROACH OF CREATING ACROSS AGENCY OFFICE HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST LIKE WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS ECONOMIC AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AND THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES- THIS APPROACH HAS ALSO WORKED WELL IN OTHER STATES LIKE MICHIGAN MINNESOTA NEW YORK AND ARIZONA. WE CANNOT MOVE THE NEEDLE ON HOMELESSNESS UNLESS THE STATE'S RESPONSE IS COORDINATED COLLABORATIVE AND AS EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE WITH A SINGLE POINT OF AUTHORITY NAVIGATING THE STATE'S RESPONSE AB TWENTY THREE TWENTY FIVE WOULD ACCOMPLISH THESE GOALS AND AYE ARCHER AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

NO OPPOSITION ON FILE WILL BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS. AND A MISS KOREA. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I THINK IT TO THE AUTHOR FOR THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE ON THE DRESSING ISSUES ON HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS I THINK WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF POSITIONS AND BILLS THAT CLEARLY INDICATE THAT HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS IS THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY THAT WE MUST ADDRESS- IS THE SINGLE MOST THING THAT COMES UP IN EVERY CONVERSATION- I YOU KNOW I'D I'D WANT TO TALK TO YOU AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING A DISCUSSION WITH ME- SEPARATELY ABOUT THIS- THIS INITIATIVE THAT YOU HAVE. SPECIFICALLY I WANNA I NEED SOME CLARIFICATION FROM YOU ON YOUR BILL- AB TWELVE TWENTY WHICH CREATED A PROCESS IN WHICH CAL I C. H. A WOULD BE THE LEAD ON HOMELESSNESS IN FACT WE HAD A HEARING ON MARCH EIGHTH OF THIS YEAR ALONE- IN WHICH WE DISCUSSED HOW HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AS WELL AS BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES IN IT AND HOUSING AGENCY SECRETARY AS- WITH SERVICE CODE. ERRORS ON THE COUNCIL AND HOW- BOTH SECRETARIES WERE NOW IN COLLABORATION TO ADDRESS ISSUES AND HOUSING AND WRAPAROUND SERVICES WHICH ARE OFTEN CONVERSATIONS THAT OCCURRENCE EYELESS. WHEN WE'RE IN BUDGET COMMITTEE ON HOUSING AND STUFF FOR. THERE'S ALWAYS A CONVERSATION ABOUT WELL WHAT ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH TAXES WHAT ABOUT WRAPAROUND SERVICES AT CETERA. IN CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD WITH MEMBERS. AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THERE'S ALWAYS A CONVERSATION OF LIKE WHAT ABOUT HOUSING AND HOW DOES IT WORK TOGETHER. SO MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT IN THE CREATION OF THIS COUNCIL IN THE CO CHAIRS WE ARE NOW BEGINNING A PROCESS IN WHICH- THESE TWO ENTITIES ARE NOT WORKING AT SILOS AND IN FACT ARE WORKING COLLABORATION. THE FIRST TIME SO I'M CURIOUS AS TO. IF THE IF THE CREATION OF CAL I C. H. AND CHANGING THE NAME OF THE ENTITY. WAS THE INTENT TO BE THE LEAD ON HOUSING ON ON ALMOST NIS. AND IT ALSO CREATED A PROCESS TO STRING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN HOUSING AND SERVICES A CONNECTION THAT IS MISSING WHEN THE TWO. AGENCIES OPERATE INDEPENDENTLY. WHY WOULD BE WHY WHEN WE JUST ESTABLISHED THAT AND WE JUST CODIFIED A PLAN TO MOVE THAT FORWARD. WHY INTRODUCED SOMETHING NOW WITHOUT ALONG THAT PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD INTO FOR US TO HAVE SOME KIND SOLUTION. AND WHAT IS THE INTENT OF CREATING A NEW POSITION. THAT DIRECTLY REPORTS TO THE GOVERNOR OR WHAT WOULD BE THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT- WITH THIS DEPOSITION. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISS CARILLO AND- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD YESTERDAY AND SOME MORE INFORMATION I SUBMITTED TO YOU THIS MORNING- THE- ALL THAT I. INTRODUCED IN THE WAS SIGNED LAST YEAR AB TWELVE TWENTY THAT YOU MENTIONED- IT RENAMED THE COUNCIL THIS COUNCIL WAS CREATED YEARS AGO BY A BILL BY ORMER SENATOR HOLLY MITCHELL IT WAS FORMALLY- NAME THE HOUSING FINANCING AND COORDINATING COUNCIL- AND WE RENAMED IT I'VE YOU KNOW THE ICY H. THE INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON HOMELESSNESS- AND IT'S MORE AFTER THE FEDERAL THE- AGENCY WHICH IS THE US INTO. A SALON HOMELESSNESS- WHERE THERE ARE THERE IS A CO CHAIR THE CUT THE CHAIR OF THE U. S. INTERAGENCY IS THE HUD SECRETARY- AND THE VICE CHAIR IS THE VETERAN AFFAIRS SECRETARY SO TWO CABINET MEMBERS- ARE YOU KNOW CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR- BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS OF THAT THIS INTER AGENCY AT THE LEVEL- IS AN ENTITY UNDER THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OUR AND HAS AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. AND THE IN AGENTS CAO IS ON THAT RIGHT WITH CULTURES THAT ARE STILL CABINET MEMBERS AND COLLABORATING ALONG WITH OTHER- A REPRESENTATIVES FROM OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES- AND SO THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ATTEMPTING TO DO TO CONTINUE RIGHT THAT COLLABORATION AND HAVE A DIRECTOR THAT WOULD BE. AT OUR EXECUTIVE LEVEL. AND HOW WILL THE DIRECTOR BE HIRED AND UNDER WHAT AGENCY OR ENTITY WITH THE DIRECTOR BE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE MEANING. WHAT THAT WHEN THE GOVERNOR WHEN THE GOVERNOR LEAVES IS THAT AN APPOINTED POSITION IS THAT- HIRED POSITION IS THAT A SECRETARY SECRETARY LEVEL CABINET POSITION RIGHT NOW IT'S A DIRECTOR SIMILAR TO THE DIRECTOR OF YES RIGHT THAT. THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES RIGHT WHICH IS UNDER OUR EGGS EXECUTIVE ADMINISTRATION- THE COUNCIL DOES HAVE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT FROM WHEN IT WAS CREATED YEARS AGO- THE INTER AGENCY COUNCIL. HAS TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE- IF I'M NOT SURE HOW OFTEN BUT IT WAS LAST IT LAST REPORTED TO US LAST YEAR. SO THAT WAS BUILT TEN FROM THE VERY BEGINNING FROM WHEN THIS COUNCIL WAS CREATING CREATED BEFORE IT WAS RENAMED. LAST YEAR UNDERSTAND HOW WE WOULD OPERATE WHETHER IT'S THE CREATION OF A NEW AGENCY A CREATION OF A NEW DEPARTMENT WHETHER IT'S THE SUBMERSION OF VARIOUS DIFFERENT AGENCIES TO REPORT TO ONE SINGLE INDIVIDUAL- IT DONE OFFICE. THE DIRECTOR WOULD SERVE AS A CORNER COORDINATOR AMONGST THESE AGENCIES THE PROGRAMS WOULD STILL BE PART OF THOSE AGENCIES AND ADMINISTERED BY THOSE AGENCIES SIMILAR TO WHAT LIKE I SAID BEFORE THAT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE IS WHICH- WE HAVE THE SAME NAME. AND I KNOW IT IT WAS INSPIRED BY THE FEDERAL AGENCY LAST YEAR FROM- YOU KNOW MY WORK ON IT LAST YEAR AND- THE SUGGESTIONS FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. BUT THE ONLY THING WE DIDN'T DO WAS STRUCTURE IT THE SAME AS THE FEDERAL- SIX AGENCY. ENDS AT UP AND WITH THE DIRECTOR WHO REPORTS. THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE WHO REPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE GOVERNOR HAVE WHAT IS THEIR ROLE WITH THE SECRETARIES OF THE DEPARTMENTS SO DO THEY HAVE WHAT THEY HAVE. IF THEY ARE IN CHARGE OF CREATE A PLAN AND LET THEY THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES HAS A DIFFERENT IDEA. THAN WHO WOULD WHO HOW WOULD THAT DECISION BE MADE WELL THE COUNCIL IS STILL CO CHAIRED BY THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THE SECRETARY OF BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING THE WAY IT'S STRUCTURED THE COUNCIL IS STILL THE SAME IT'S STILL FUNCTIONS THE SAME WAY THAT. WITH THE WAY IT WAS CREATED RIGHT- BUT DIRECTOR- IT AND IT'S NOT A REPORTING STRUCTURE THE SECRETARIES DO NOT REPORT TO THIS DIRECTOR. RIGHT SO I'M NOT SURE NO THE SATELLITE HERRIES THE SECRETARIES WORKING COLLABORATION WITH THE- BASED ON THE R. CHAIR OF. COUNTS THAT FALLS UNDER THIS PROPOSED OFFICE LED BY A DIRECTOR WHAT THAT'S WHAT MY QUESTION LIES SO MY QUESTION IS REALLY MORE ON OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY SO REPORTING AND YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WORK WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION ON A CABINET LEVEL. THEN WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE DIRECTOR AND WHO HAS OVERSIGHT OVER THE DIRECTOR'S PLAN OR ANY ACTION PLANS THAT GET IMPLEMENTED SO RIGHT NOW. THE PLAN FOR THE BILL THAT YOU WORKED ON TWENTY EIGHT TWELVE TWENTY IS MOVING FORWARD AND YOU KNOW BASED ON. CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD ITS- CODIFYING THE ACTION PLAN SO I'M I'M JUST TRY I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND YOUR VISION AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND LIKE HOW IT WOULD WORK AND WHAT WOULD BE THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT UNDER WHICH- WHERE WOULD FALL. LIKE I SAID BEFORE THE- THE COUNCIL DOES HAVE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT RIGHT THE COUNCIL THE COUNCIL DOES BUT WITH THE DIRECTOR HAVE OVERSIGHT. BECAUSE THE DIRECTOR NOW BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE SAID REPORTS TO THE GOVERNOR. BUT WE HAVE BEEN AS LEGISLATORS WE CREATE THE POLICIES RIGHT THERE THE STATE. DIRECTORS ARE AGENCIES IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS THAT WE CREATE WE DON'T RUN ANYTHING THEY DON'T REPORT TO US RIGHT BUT WE HAVE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT THROUGH BUDGET THE BUDGET PROCESS WE DECIDE HOW MUCH. WILL BE ALLOCATED FOR HOMELESSNESS EACH YEAR OR IF IT WILL BE MULTIPLE YEARS LIKE A LOT OF US HAVE ADVOCATED FOR- THAT IS HOW THE LEGISLATURE HAS OVERSIGHT. OVER ANY STATE AGENCY. RIGHT THEY DON'T REPORT TO US. BUT THEY DO IN TERMS OF REPORTING TO THE LEGISLATURE IF THE REQUIRED TO PLAY. IN SOME WAY. I GUESS I'M I GUESS I'M ARE YOU SAYING THAT IF THEY REPORT TO US LIKE. WELL WHEN A PLAN IS CREATED BY THE DIRECTOR IF THE GOAL IS TO HAVE THE DIRECTOR B. LIKE THE MAIN INDIVIDUAL- WORKING ON ISSUES RELATED TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS ACROSS THE STATE. BUT YET WE HAVE INDIVIDUAL EIGHT SEATS AND START. TO DO THAT SAME WORK I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT ALL COMES TOGETHER WHO CREATES THE PLAN WHO'S RESPONSIBLE. AT THE DIRECTOR REPORTS. THE CONVERSE WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE. AND THEN WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE LEGISLATURE IN. I'M NOT HEARING LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CREATE THE PLAN BECAUSE THAT WOULDN'T BE THE ROLE OF. THE LEGISLATURE IF YOU'RE CREATING A POSITION FOR A DIRECTOR TO DO THAT. SO I'M I'M I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT WOULD FUNCTION HOW IT WOULD WORK AND WHERE THE LEGISLATURE WHAT ULTIMATELY HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT SO I YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND LIKE. THE INCREDIBLE MAGNITUDE OF THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE ALL TRYING TO WORK TOGETHER TO RESOLVE. MY GOAL IN THE IN THE QUESTIONS BASED ON THE BASED ON THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE AND BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE FOUR ON STATE ADMINISTRATION ASSEMBLY WHERE DOES THE ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT OF THE LEGISLATURE FALL. AND ULTIMATELY LIKE WHAT IS THAT FRAMEWORK LOOK LIKE. SO IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT STILL LIKE IN DEVELOPMENT THAT'S OKAY TOO- I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS AGENCY I MEAN THAT THE COUNCIL THE INTERAGENCY COUNCIL. IT'S ALREADY PART OF THE FRAMEWORK ON HOLD LEGISLATIVE OVER YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT THAT THEY HAVE. RIGHT SO IT'S ALREADY PART OF THIS COUNCIL. BUT THE DIRECTOR ISN'T YOU'RE CREATING A NEW POSITION THE DIRECTOR THE REPORTS TO THE GOVERNOR IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ENTITY. SO THAT'S THAT'S WHERE IT'S DIFFERENT THAN THE COUNCIL. BUT THE DIRECTOR WOULD HAVE MORE OF POWER RIGHT TO COORDINATE BECAUSE CURRENTLY THERE'S A DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF HOMELESSNESS WITHIN THE- BUSINESS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HOUSING THAT REPORTS THE SECRETARY- AND THIS DIRECTOR WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO MORE OF THE OTHER AGENCIES RIGHT TO HELP COORDINATE. THE STATE IN TERMS OF OUR PROCESS PROGRAMS SERVE THE DIRECTOR THEN HAS ACCESS TO MORE AGENCIES THAT MAY BE FALL WITHIN VARIOUS DIFFERENT OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY SUBCOMMITTEES. THEN THE CONVERSATIONS CAN POTENTIALLY BE STILL IN SILOS IF YOU'RE WORKING WITH AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OR IF YOU'RE WORKING WITHIN. A STATE ADMINISTRATION ON HOUSING AND MAYBE. KEEP AND HAVE DOLLARS OR PROJECT ROOM KEY HOME KEY SOME I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AGAIN JUST SIMPLY WHERE THE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE IF THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL WOULD HAVE VARIOUS DIFFERENT ACCESS POINTS. SO AGAIN IT'S A GOOD. I'LL BE SUPPORTING YOUR BILL TODAY BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO CREATE A FRAMEWORK IN WHICH THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AND I HOPE THAT WITHIN THE POLICY DISCUSSIONS THAT CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. THERE'S A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AS TO THE FRAMEWORK AS WELL AS WHAT WILL ULTIMATELY ULTIMATELY BE. THE LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT TO A NEW DIRECTOR WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU- SOUNDS LIKE. REALLY FOR THEIR CONVERSATIONS NEED TO TAKE PLACE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. WITH EMOTION SECOND APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRING THE BILL FORWARD- HAVE YOU MOVED OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY WITH SOUNDS LIKE MORE WORK NEEDS TO BE DONE. WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANKS TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR QUESTIONS TODAY- YOU KNOW WE WERE ALL ELECTED TO COME TO SACRAMENTO AND ADDRESS. ISSUES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND HOMELESSNESS- AS MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HAVE EXPRESSED AND I'M SURE ALL OF US AGREE IS THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE. THAT IS ON THE TOP OF THE MIND OF ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS IN CALIFORNIA- THIS IS ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I COME HERE EVERY WEEK AND LEAVE HOME- IS WHAT. CAN THE STATE DO WHAT IS OUR ROLE IN SOLVING HOMELESSNESS IF WE ARE NOT STRUCTURED IF WITH TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE AT THE STATE LEVEL TO. COLLABORATE WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT WE'RE NOT DOING OUR JOB AND- YOU KNOW WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION. TO CONTINUE TO PUSH IN THESE AREAS THAT MIGHT MAKE OTHERS UNCOMFORTABLE INCLUDING ADMINISTRATION. BUT THAT IS OUR JOB WE ARE THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH WE HAVE A SAY TO AND HOW PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY. TO DO THAT THROUGH THIS BILL AND I WELCOME MORE CONVERSATIONS ON THIS AND MORE- IDEAS BUT WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH RIGHT NOW. HOMELESSNESS THE TOP POLICY THE TOP PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA IS BEING LED BY A COUNCIL. A COUNCIL THAT'S CO CHAIRED. BY TWO INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE FULL TIME JOBS AND THAT DO A GREAT JOB RUNNING THEIR pTHE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM WE'RE NOT PUTTING THE RESOURCES THAT IT NEEDS TO SOLVE IT AT THE STATE LEVEL. I'M AND THAT'S WHY- I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO PUSH TOWARDS CHANGING ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR STATE GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU IN THE MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED THE COMMUTE ASSEMBLY COMMITTED APPROPRIATIONS.

GOOD AFTERNOON TEREX- COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS TANYA CHOLESBURY NUMBER HALF THE STATE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA AND I'M HERE IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWO SIX FIVE SIX THE BILL AS AN ATTEMPT BY HOUSING DEVELOPERS INTEREST GROUPS TO EXPAND THE REACH OF RIGHTS THE PUBLIC AND THE DUTIES AFFORDED TO PUBLIC AGENCIES UNDERSEA QUEST. TO ADDRESS THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES- BEFORE PROJECTS ARE APPROVED THE BILL WOULD REDEFINE BASIC LAND USE LAWS BY CREATING A NEW DEFINITION OF PROJECT DISAPPROVAL THAT PROHIBITS AGENCY DECISION MAKERS FROM REQUIRING ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW WHEN THEY REASONABLY BELIEVE BASED ON THE RECORD BEFORE THEN THE PROJECT IS NOT EXEMPT OR IT REQUIRES FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IN MITIGATION. I'M EVEN THOUGH THESE ANALYSIS ARE NOT EVEN COMPLETE YET THIS BILL REDEFINES THOSE ACTIONS AS DISAPPROVAL- THIS IS CONTRARY TO SEE QUEST AND IT WOULD REQUIRE. AGENCY DECISION MAKERS TO WHICH WOULD REQUIRE AGENCY DECISION MAKER SMITH DO AN INDEPENDENT JUDGMENT ABOUT SEA QUEST- COMPLIANCE. THE BILL WOULD INTERRUPT THE SIGNAL PROCESSING PRESSURE LOCAL AGENCIES TO LIMIT THEIR REVIEW FOR HOUSING PROJECTS OR RISK COSTLY AND PUNITIVE LAWSUITS. THIS TO BE PREMATURELY CHALLENGING A SEQUEL EVALUATION IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PROCESS UNDER A DIFFERENT STATUTE THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT INSTEAD OF UNDERSEA QUEST. AB TWO SIX FIVE SIX WOULD INCREASE LITIGATION IT WOULD OPEN A NEW DOOR TO AGENCY IS BEING THREATENED BY DEVELOPERS A TURN TO PAY ATTORNEY'S FEES AND PAY FINES- SIMPLY FOR BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF A PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING MITIGATION FOR OUR COMMUNITY AS- IT WOULD. CAUSE A LONGER STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS THAT WILL ALLOW DEVELOPERS TO CHALLENGE AGENCY DECISIONS. ULTIMATELY IT IS JUST INCONSISTENT WITH SEQUINS MANDATES AND INCONSISTENT WITH THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OWN MANDATES THAT THE LOCAL AGENCY MUST COMPLY WITH C. QUOTE BEFORE INCURRING ANY LIABILITY FOR DENYING A- STUDIES HAVE. A SEAT IS NOT A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO NEW HOUSING.

GOT A MOTION A SECOND THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SEVENTY THREE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUPPLIER DIVERSITY ACT I WOULD LIKE TO START BY THANKING THIS COMMITTEE'S STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE. ON THIS ISSUE AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS WITH RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. I WILL BE ACCEPTING TO SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS IN THE NEXT POLICY COMMITTEE. CALIFORNIANS MAY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN RECENT YEARS UNFORTUNATELY THESE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY LIMITED TO DEVELOPERS THAT DO NOT REFLECT OUR STATE'S RICH RACIAL AND ETHNIC DIVERSITY. AS IT STANDS THE INDUSTRY BY AND LARGE HAS NOT MADE A CONSCIOUS EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT MORE DIVERSE AND WOMEN OWNED FIRMS HAVE ACCESS TO DEVELOPMENT RELATED CONTRACTS. ACCORDING TO A TWENTY TWENTY ONE SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THIS ON THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION NONPROFIT HOUSING THE MAJORITY NONPROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPERS DO NOT HAVE PROCUREMENT POLICIES IN PLACE TO ADDRESS SUPPLIER DIVERSITY. AB TWENTY SEVENTY THREE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE CALIFORNIA TOWARD GREATER DIVERSITY BY REQUIRING HOUSING SPONSORS THAT RECEIVE AN ALLOCATION OF LOW INCOME TAX CREDITS. FROM CALIFORNIA TAX CREDIT ALLOCATION COMMITTEE REPORT ON THE USE OF WOMEN MINORITIES DISABLED VETERAN AND LGBT. REPRESENTATIVES THIS BILL ALSO REQUIRES THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS GREAT AND SHARE DETAILED AND- VERIFIABLE PLANT INCREASED DIVERSE PROCUREMENT THROUGH AN ANNUAL REPORT. MEMBERS IN ORDER TO ADVANCE RACIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT INDUSTRY MOST INTENTIONALLY UPLIFT INVESTING FIRMS. LED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR. WOMEN DISABLED VETERANS IN LGBTQ PLUS INDIVIDUALS. THIS BILL IS ABOUT CREATING AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES WHO NEED IT MOST BY DIVERSE FIRMS THAT. MORE LIKELY- WE MORE LIKELY TO TAKE A PEOPLE CENTERED APPROACH THAT IS MY FOR HOW PROJECTS CAN. BENEFIT AND UPLIFT THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY I'M JOINED BY CO SPONSORS ADAM BRIANNA'S WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BUILDERS. AND CONSTANTINE HATCHER WITH CALIFORNIA YIMBY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU OUR GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS ADAM BRIANNA'S AND I'M CEO OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BUILDERS A NONPROFIT PUBLIC POLICY ORGANIZATION WORKING TO CLOSE THE RACIAL WEALTH GAP THROUGH HOUSING HOMEOWNERSHIP AND SMALL BUSINESS ENTREPRENEURSHIP. I'M HERE TODAY IS A BILL SPONSORED EXPRESSED MY STRONG SUPPORT FOR AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY THREE BEFORE I BEGIN MY REMARKS I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO CHAIR WICKS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF FOR BRINGING FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL. AS WELL AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER JONES SAWYER FOR BEING THIS LEGISLATIVE CHAMPION ON THIS BILL. AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY THREE WILL BRING TRANSPARENCY INCREASED ENHANCE DATA TO SUPPORT DIVERSE SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FIELD. CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY BUILDERS I SPENT A DECADE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCE DEVELOPMENT MOSTLY IN NEW YORK. WHILE THERE I HAD DIRECT INTERACTION WITH A SIMILAR PROGRAM TO WHAT AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY THREE IS PROPOSING. CALLED THE BUILDING- BUILDING OPPORTUNITY INITIATIVE. AS A PROJECT MANAGER FOR THE CITY OF NEW YORK AND IS A VICE PRESIDENT REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT AT AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER. I WAS THE ONE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT PAPERWORK RELATED TO WORKFORCE TRANSPARENCY WAS SUBMITTED FOR MY PROJECTS. THE IMPACT OF PROGRAMS LIKE THESE OF IT DEVELOPERS WHO ARE ALL WORKING ON TAXPAYER FINANCED PROJECTS. HAVE TO THINK JUST A LITTLE HARDER ABOUT WHO THEY INVITE TO BID FOR THEIR PROJECTS AND OFTEN CAST A WIDER BITNET BECAUSE OF IT. INTERN THESE PROGRAMS ALLOW DIVERSE CONTRACTORS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A TRACK RECORD IN THE MOST STABLE FIELD IN THE REAL ESTATE SECTOR. IT HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT WHEN MORE SUPPLIERS CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS ARE GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO BID ON WORK HE CREATES COMPETITION AND IMPROVE SERVICE DELIVERY FOR THE-INDUSTRY. I ALSO AGREE WITH THE ASSOCIATED GENERAL CONTRACTORS OF AMERICA WHO STATED THAT. MINORITY BUSINESSES ARE MORE LIKELY TO CREATE JOBS AND EMPLOY WORKERS AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES. SO THIS LEGISLATION COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE A WIDE RANGING AND POSITIVE IMPACT ON DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AT NO MATERIAL COSTS TO THE TAXPAYER. IN CLOSING LIKE TO SAY THAT THIS IS A SUNSHINE BILL THAT DOES NOT ESTABLISH QUOTAS TO REQUIRE ANY AFFORDABLE DEVELOPER. TO WORK WITH A FIRM THAT DOES NOT MEET THEIR STANDARDS. BASED ON EXAMPLE SET BY NEW YORK AS WELL AS OUR OWN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION SUPPLIER DIVERSITY PROGRAM. I BELIEVE THAT THIS COMMONSENSE BILL WILL CREATE THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO HAVE BETTER. DATA DRIVEN CONVERSATIONS RELATED TO SUPPORTING HARD WORKING SMALL BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. THANK YOU- GOOD. THANK YOU ESTEEMED CHAIR WICKS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THANK YOU SEE MEMBERS- JONES SAWYER PEER LEADERSHIP IN OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT BILL. ROSS SELECTED THANK BILL SPONSOR ALASKA FOR THE ADVOCACY A SCHOLARSHIP TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. HI MY NAME IS CONSTANTIN HATCHER SENIOR DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY IMPACT FOR CALIFORNIA YIMBY A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO MAKING OUR STATE AND AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE WORK AND RAISE A FAMILY- TO ALLEVIATE OUR CURRENT HOUSING CRISIS CALIFORNIA'S DELOYING AN UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN FACT DEVELOPER SPEND FIFTY TWO BILLION AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT BETWEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY WE ALSO KNOW CALIFORNIA NEEDS ABOUT THREE TIMES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE CONSTRUCTION WORK FORCE THAT HAS NOW CURRENTLY HOWEVER BUSINESSES OWNED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR AND OTHER MINORITIES HAVE NOT SHARED IN THESE DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES AT A RATE EQUIVALENT TO OUR STATE'S RICH DIVERSITY. OVER THE YEARS THIS IS LET EVERS FIRMS LOSING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN POTENTIAL CONTRACTS WHICH MEANS OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITIES MISSED OUT ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN WEALTH IN THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF LIFE CHANGING IF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY WAS AS DIVERSE AS CALIFORNIA'S POPULATION COMMUNITIES OF COLOR COULD EXPECT APPROXIMATELY THIRTY TWO POINT FOUR BILLION IN PAYROLL INVESTMENTS ALONE IMAGINE THE IMPACT THESE RESOURCE COULD HAVE ON SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES BUT JUST INCENTIVIZING MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUILDERS TO BE MORE INTENTIONAL ABOUT WHO THEY'RE HIRING. AB TWENTY EIGHT SEVENTY THREE IS A FIRST STEP IN ADDRESSING THIS TRAGIC INEQUITY AND GIVES THE OPPORTUNITY TO DRIVE FOR RACIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE AND PROMOTE TRANSPARENCY AROUND RACIAL INEQUITIES WITHIN THE INDUSTRY BY TRACKING SUPPLIER DIVERSITY BY DIVERSIFYING THE PIPELINE OF PEOPLE WHO SHARED THE REVENUE RESULTING FROM THE VITAL PUBLIC INVESTMENTS WE CAN INCREASE WEALTH THE MOST COMMUNITIES TYPICALLY EXCLUDED FROM SUCH A VALUABLE OPPORTUNITIES SIMULTANEOUSLY NURTURING TO BURSTYN'S CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT SUPPLY FIRMS WILL HELP INCREASE THE VOLUME UP THAT'S PRETTY NEAT CONSTRUCTION DESIGN ENGINEERING AND OTHER RELATED FIRMS OPERATING SUCCESSFULLY ACROSS THE STATE. IF THE DIVERSE FIRMS AND WORKING WILL HELP INCREASE THE ANNUAL NUMBER OF HOMES BUILT IN CALIFORNIA AND HELP FINANCIALLY EMPOWER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THAT HAVE LONG BEEN SHUT OUT OF PASS. TO UPWARD MOBILITY AND PROSPERITY. THIS HELPS GROW THE WORKFORCE IN A WAY THAT ENCOURAGES RACE EQUITY. HELPING SOLVE OVERALL SUPPLY SHORTAGE IN WITH ALSO ADVANCES GOOD JOBS FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN AND THOSE FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS. THIS IS WHY ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA YIMBY IN OUR TENS OF THOUSAND MEMBERS AND AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE.
