EVIDENT. THAT WE HAVE

AS WELL AS THOSE WHO WORK IN

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:43.426
THOSE FACILITIES- WE DID HEAR

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:44.527
THE HORROR STORIES WE HEARD

01:02:44.594 --> 01:02:46.195
THEM FROM THOSE INSIDE. WE

01:02:46.262 --> 01:02:48.564
HEARD THEM FROM FAMILY MEMBERS

01:02:48.631 --> 01:02:49.966
WE HEARD IN FROM CORRECTIONAL

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:51.334
OFFICERS WHO WERE FORCED TO

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.835
BASICALLY SLEEP IN THEIR OWN

01:02:52.902 --> 01:02:55.638
CARS OR IN THEIR GARAGES FOR

01:02:55.705 --> 01:03:02.145
FEAR OF BRINGING CALLED IT INTO.

01:03:02.211 --> 01:03:02.745
THEIR FAMILIES WHEN THEY WENT

01:03:02.812 --> 01:03:04.647
HOME. SO WE ALSO KNOW THE FACT

01:03:04.714 --> 01:03:06.449
THAT. INCORPORATE PEOPLE. HAVE

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:10.086
A HIGHER RATE OF THAT THE- OR-

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:12.021
HEALTH PROBLEMS MORE SO THAN

01:03:12.088 --> 01:03:14.056
THE GENERAL POPULATION. AND WE

01:03:14.123 --> 01:03:15.691
ALSO KNOW AND I'VE HAD A

01:03:15.758 --> 01:03:18.094
SUCCESSION WITH BOTH THE CDC

01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:21.697

MAIN CONDITION AND THAT'S

01:03:32.975 --> 01:03:33.809
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE

01:03:33.876 --> 01:03:36.879
BUILDINGS ARE ABOUT. THE AGE

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:39.916

THAT HAVE NOT BEEN UPGRADED I

01:03:41.951 --> 01:03:43.953
THOUGHT ALL OF THE THINGS LEAD

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.556
TO A VAST AMOUNT OF- INCREASING

01:03:46.622 --> 01:03:48.357

ALMOST ANYTHING ELSE. YET THEY

01:04:14.584 --> 01:04:17.720

01:06:26.415 --> 01:06:27.917
CRITICAL PRIORITY FOR THE

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.018
US BUT WE'RE WORKING REALLY

01:07:36.085 --> 01:07:38.854

SECOND PANEL YOU'D MENTIONED-

01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:04.747
FLU VACCINATIONS ARE THOSE

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:09.518
GOING TO BE REQUIRED. OKAY I

01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:11.654
WAS HAVING A LITTLE PTSD ABOUT

01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.856
THE SKI YEAR EXPERIMENT YES

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:15.424
ALRIGHT SO FLU VACCINATION IS

01:08:15.491 --> 01:08:17.827
NOT REQUIRED IT'S OFFERED AND

01:08:17.893 --> 01:08:20.696
WE HAVE- EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS

01:08:20.763 --> 01:08:24.266
AND CAMPAIGNS TO REALLY- TRY TO

01:08:24.333 --> 01:08:26.302
GET THE MESSAGE OUT THAT WITH

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:27.736
HOLDEN CIRCULATING AND

01:08:27.803 --> 01:08:29.338
INFLUENZA CIRCULATING AT THE

01:08:29.405 --> 01:08:32.141
SAME TIME WE NEED TO BE EXTRA

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:34.577
VIGILANT OUR FLU VACCINE UPTAKE

01:08:34.643 --> 01:08:38.113
IN OUR POPULATION IS AROUND 50%

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:41.851
HISTORICALLY WE ARE STRIVING

01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:44.386
465% IN THE GENERAL POPULATION

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:46.922
AND 75% AND THOSE OVER AGE

01:08:46.989 --> 01:08:48.724
SIXTY FIVE. AND SO WE HAVE SOME

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.493
GOALS WE'VE ALREADY STARTED

01:08:50.559 --> 01:08:52.428
VACCINE PROGRAMS MANY

01:08:52.495 --> 01:08:53.095
INSTITUTIONS HAVE ALREADY

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:55.664
STARTED- OFFERING THE VACCINES

01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:57.900
EDUCATING THE POPULATION AND

01:08:57.967 --> 01:09:00.002
PROMOTING INFLUENZA VACCINE BUT

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:02.304
IT IS NOT MANDATED OKAY AND

01:09:02.371 --> 01:09:04.773
THEN TO PIGGY BACK ON ASSEMBLY

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.641
MEMBER WALDRON'S QUESTION

01:09:05.708 --> 01:09:07.776
AROUND MENTAL HEALTH FOR FOLKS

01:09:07.843 --> 01:09:09.512
WHO ARE NOT INCARCERATED WHO

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:12.348
HAVE THE YOU ARE BLESSED ENOUGH

01:09:12.414 --> 01:09:14.550
TO WORK IN THEIR HOME AND- GO

01:09:14.617 --> 01:09:16.585
PERIODICALLY TO A PARK OR TO

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:19.021
THE GROCERY STORE- BUT ARE AT

01:09:19.088 --> 01:09:21.056
HOME WORKING OR YOU KNOW

01:09:21.123 --> 01:09:23.559
HELPING THEIR CHILDREN- GAIN

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:24.994
THEIR EDUCATION WE'RE SEEING

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.963
UPTICKS IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE

01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:32.334
AND IN MENTAL HEALTH- SUFFERING

01:09:32.401 --> 01:09:35.437
SO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE. THAT IT

01:09:35.504 --> 01:09:37.540
WOULD BE EXACERBATED FOR

01:09:37.606 --> 01:09:40.776
SOMEONE WHO'S INCARCERATED

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:43.012
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'VE STOPPED

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:48.651
VISITATION YOU SAID IT ENACTED-

01:09:48.717 --> 01:09:49.818
IMPLEMENTED TO SPATIAL

01:09:49.885 --> 01:09:51.420
DISTANCING PROTOCOLS AND THEN

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:55.491
REDUCED ACTIVITIES. SO CAN YOU

01:09:55.558 --> 01:09:57.092
JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE TO

01:09:57.159 --> 01:09:59.528
HOPEFULLY SOME OF THE ENHANCED

01:09:59.595 --> 01:10:01.564
MEASURES AROUND MENTAL HEALTH

01:10:01.630 --> 01:10:03.465
BECAUSE WE'VE ALSO HEARD ABOUT

01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:08.404
AN UP IN- SUICIDE INCIDENTS OR-

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:10.706
X. CENTER US SO I I'M

01:10:10.773 --> 01:10:13.375
CONCERNED. THAT WE'RE HOUSING

01:10:13.442 --> 01:10:15.811
FOLKS THERE'S A LACK OF

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:17.813
INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE FIND

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:21.850
CREDIBLE COMING TO ALL OF US-

01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:23.652
THERE'S A LACK OF ACCESS TO

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:26.622
PHONES I'VE HEARD THAT THE SOME

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:29.425
OF THE MAIL HAS BEEN CURTAILED-

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:31.927
SO WHAT I MEAN CAN YOU SPEAK TO

01:10:31.994 --> 01:10:33.796
SORT OF WHAT YOU'RE SEEING AND

01:10:33.862 --> 01:10:34.797
MAYBE ELEVATE SOME OF THE

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:36.332
CONCERNS THAT HAVE COME UP FROM

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:38.133
THE OTHER PANELISTS AROUND. THE

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:39.835
MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IN THEIR

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:42.471
PRISONS. YEAH HEY HERE YOU KNOW

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:44.673
I'VE IT'S BEEN CERTAINLY ON OUR

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.308
RADAR SINCE THE BEGINNING AND I

01:10:46.375 --> 01:10:47.910
THINK THE CONCERNS ABOUT TO

01:10:47.977 --> 01:10:50.512
QUARANTINE AND ISOLATION AND

01:10:50.579 --> 01:10:52.147
WHEN THERE ARE EVEN SMALL

01:10:52.214 --> 01:10:53.382
OUTBREAKS OFTEN THERE'S

01:10:53.449 --> 01:10:54.750
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

01:10:54.817 --> 01:10:55.985
IDENTIFIED AS POTENTIAL

01:10:56.051 --> 01:10:58.153
CONTACTS. WHO THEN HAVE TO GO

01:10:58.220 --> 01:10:59.855
INTO QUARANTINE AND QUARANTINE

01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:02.591
IS FOURTEEN DAYS WHICH IS A

01:11:02.658 --> 01:11:04.059
VERY LONG TIME TO BE IN

01:11:04.126 --> 01:11:05.494
QUARANTINE AND PARTICULARLY IN

01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:06.762
SOME OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

01:11:06.829 --> 01:11:09.098
WOULD THAT WERE DESCRIBED. SO I

01:11:09.164 --> 01:11:11.233
THINK- THERE IF THIS IS BEEN ON

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:12.768
THE RADAR AND UNDERSTOOD THAT

01:11:12.835 --> 01:11:14.637
THAT IS A SIGNIFICANT RISK IN

01:11:14.703 --> 01:11:16.405
NOT JUST THE PHYSICAL THREAT OF

01:11:16.472 --> 01:11:18.007
COVERT NINETEEN BUT ALSO THE

01:11:18.073 --> 01:11:19.908
MENTAL HEALTHCHALLENGES THAT

01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:21.677
AS YOU SAY ALL OF US ARE. ARE

01:11:21.744 --> 01:11:23.312
DEALING WITH BUT ESPECIALLY IN

01:11:23.379 --> 01:11:26.215
OUR PRISONS SO WE HAVE- WE HAVE

01:11:26.281 --> 01:11:27.650
A MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM AND I

01:11:27.716 --> 01:11:30.119
THINK THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING TO

01:11:30.185 --> 01:11:32.788
FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO PROVIDE

01:11:32.855 --> 01:11:34.857
THOSE SERVICES IF. PREVIOUSLY

01:11:34.923 --> 01:11:36.191
THERE WERE GROUPS OF PEOPLE IF

01:11:36.258 --> 01:11:37.526
THEY CAN'T SOCIALLY DISTANCE

01:11:37.593 --> 01:11:39.828
PEOPLE THEY CAN PROVIDE ONE ON

01:11:39.895 --> 01:11:42.431
ONE COUNSELING- AND SO WE HAVE

01:11:42.498 --> 01:11:44.700
TRIED SIMILAR TO THE COMMUNITY

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:46.235
TO ADAPT TO THE WAY THAT

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:48.437
SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. SO THAT

01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:50.806
THEY CAN BESAFE FROM AN

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:52.441
INFECTION CONTROL STANDPOINT

01:11:52.508 --> 01:11:55.577
THEY CAN BE SAFE FROM MICROBIT

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:56.945
NINETEEN STAFF JOINT I DON'T

01:11:57.012 --> 01:11:57.846

01:11:57.913 --> 01:11:59.214
FINGERTIPS ON THE MENTAL HEALTH

01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:00.849
PROGRAM BUT I WOULD BE HAPPY TO

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:03.652
ELEVATE THESE CONCERNS. AND GET

01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:04.153

OPTIONAL OKAY SO THIS YEAR IN

01:13:30.639 --> 01:13:31.240
THIS ROOM YESTERDAY WITH A

01:13:31.306 --> 01:13:33.675
MEETING- WITH PUBLIC HEALTH.

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:34.810
AND WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:36.044
THE- WITH SKILLED NURSING

01:13:36.111 --> 01:13:38.347
FACILITIES AND TWENTY PER CENT

01:13:38.413 --> 01:13:39.715
PERCENT THE STATE'S DEATH FROM

01:13:39.782 --> 01:13:40.949
COVERT CAME FROM SKILLED

01:13:41.016 --> 01:13:43.519
NURSING FACILITIES. AND YOU

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:45.020
KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THAT SO IS

01:13:45.087 --> 01:13:46.455
THERE ANY PLAN TO MAKE SURE

01:13:46.522 --> 01:13:48.023
SINCE THIS IS AN AT RISK GROUP

01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:49.691
WHEN THE VACCINE DOES COME OUT

01:13:49.758 --> 01:13:50.125
TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE

01:13:50.192 --> 01:13:52.661
PRIORITIZE. TO GET THE VACCINE

01:13:52.728 --> 01:13:54.329
FOR COLLUDED. PART FOR ONCE A

01:13:54.396 --> 01:13:58.100
COVERED VACCINE COMES OUT. YES

01:13:58.167 --> 01:14:00.536
YOU'RE ASKING YEAH. I WE WILL

01:14:00.602 --> 01:14:01.503
BE WILL BE WORK WITH THIS. AND

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:03.005
WITH THE CDC I BELIEVE THERE'S

01:14:03.071 --> 01:14:04.506
A TIERED APPROACH TO

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:05.641
PRIORITIZING CERTAIN

01:14:05.707 --> 01:14:07.276
INDIVIDUALS FOR THE PROBATE

01:14:07.342 --> 01:14:09.511
VACCINE. AND THAT'LL DEPEND ON

01:14:09.578 --> 01:14:10.846
THE TRIALS AND SORT OF WHO

01:14:10.913 --> 01:14:12.347
BENEFITS FROM THE VACCINE BUT I

01:14:12.414 --> 01:14:14.283
BELIEVE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS.

01:14:14.349 --> 01:14:17.452
ARE IN THAT TOP TIER. AND WE

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:19.588
ARE ADVOCATING STRONGLY THAT

01:14:19.655 --> 01:14:21.023
THERE'S CONSIDERATION FOR

01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:22.457
CUSTODY OFFICERS AND OTHER

01:14:22.524 --> 01:14:23.826
FOLKS WHO WORK IN HIGH RISK

01:14:23.892 --> 01:14:25.961
ENVIRONMENTS. BECAUSE NOT ONLY

01:14:26.028 --> 01:14:27.963
ARE THEY AT RISK OF. BRINGING

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:29.932
THE VIRUS INTO THE FACILITIES.

01:14:29.998 --> 01:14:31.466
BUT THEY ARE AT RISK OF GETTING

01:14:31.533 --> 01:14:33.635
INFECTED WHILE AT WORK AND SO

01:14:33.702 --> 01:14:35.504
WE ARE ADVOCATING STRONGLY THAT

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:37.105
THEY ARE ALSO PRIORITIZES TOP

01:14:37.172 --> 01:14:38.574
TIER AND THEN OF COURSE OUR

01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:41.210
PATIENTS OUR RESIDENTS- GIVEN

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:43.712
THEIR UNIQUE RISK. LIVING IN

01:14:43.779 --> 01:14:45.581
THIS CONGREGATE SETTINGS. NOT

01:14:45.647 --> 01:14:46.849
SURE ABOUT THE FACT THAT A LOT

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:48.684
OF FOLKS GET- DESPONDENT

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:50.719
BECAUSE- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S

01:14:50.786 --> 01:14:51.820

IMMEDIATELY ONCE I HAD BEEN.

01:41:19.807 --> 01:41:21.241
FOUND SUITABLE AND I UNDERSTAND

01:41:21.308 --> 01:41:22.876
THAT THE PROCEDURE IN OTHER

01:41:22.943 --> 01:41:24.845
STATES. PEOPLE ARE RELEASED

01:41:24.912 --> 01:41:25.946
WITHIN THREE DAYS AFTER BEING

01:41:26.013 --> 01:41:27.514
FOUND SUITABLE IN THE STATE WE

01:41:27.581 --> 01:41:29.783
HAVE TO WAIT A HUNDRED AND

01:41:29.850 --> 01:41:30.350
TWENTY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY

01:41:30.417 --> 01:41:31.652
DAYS FOR GOVERNOR'S RELEASE.

01:41:31.718 --> 01:41:32.920
WHICH MAKES NO SENSE TO ME

01:41:32.986 --> 01:41:34.588
ESPECIALLY WITH THIS CULVERT

01:41:34.655 --> 01:41:36.023
TAKING PLACE RIGHT NOW. THOSE

01:41:36.089 --> 01:41:37.191
THAT ARE BEING RELEASED ARE

01:41:37.257 --> 01:41:39.960
DOES THAT- HAVE SHORT TERMS

01:41:40.027 --> 01:41:41.562
WHICH WE UNDERSTAND BUT THERE

01:41:41.628 --> 01:41:42.763
ARE ALSO THOSE THAT HAVE LONG

01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:44.832
TERMS. THAT HAVE HIGH RISK

01:41:44.898 --> 01:41:45.799
MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT SHOULD

01:41:45.866 --> 01:41:48.302
BE CONSIDERED- RIGHT ALONG WITH

01:41:48.368 --> 01:41:50.871
THE REST OF POPULATION- ACTS

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:55.676
THAT YOU. IT LOOKS GOOD ON

01:41:55.742 --> 01:41:56.310
PAPER WITH WITH THE DOCTORS ARE

01:41:56.376 --> 01:41:57.678
SAYING HERE ARE WHAT. CITY R.

01:41:57.744 --> 01:41:58.779
CD C. R. STAYING HERE AOUT

01:41:58.846 --> 01:42:00.347
WHAT THEY DO TO PREVENT THE

01:42:00.414 --> 01:42:01.882
MATTERS OF IN MAYES CATCHING

01:42:01.949 --> 01:42:04.084
THE CULPRIT. BUT IN REALITY IN

01:42:04.151 --> 01:42:05.986
REALITY IT'S NOT HAPPENING THE

01:42:06.053 --> 01:42:07.454
WAY IT LOOKS ON PAPER. AND SO I

01:42:07.521 --> 01:42:08.755
BELIEVE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:42:08.822 --> 01:42:10.157
MORE ACTION TAKEN FROM THOSE

01:42:10.224 --> 01:42:12.226
THAT ARE IN POSITIONS TO. TO

01:42:12.292 --> 01:42:15.195
ACTIVATE- THE PROPER PROCEDURES

01:42:15.262 --> 01:42:16.497
THE STAFF SHOULD IT SHOULD BE

01:42:16.563 --> 01:42:18.098
PROPERLY TRAINED AND SHOULD BE

01:42:18.165 --> 01:42:19.867
HELD TO A HIGHER STANDARD. TO

01:42:19.933 --> 01:42:21.201
PROTECT THOSE THAT ARE INSIDE

01:42:21.268 --> 01:42:22.736
BECAUSE WE WERE NOT SENTENCED

01:42:22.803 --> 01:42:23.604

01:42:23.670 --> 01:42:25.372
SENTENCED TO DO OUR TIME. TO

01:42:25.439 --> 01:42:27.608
REHABILITATE OURSELVES INTENT

01:42:27.674 --> 01:42:28.609
THEN TO BE RELEASED INTO

01:42:28.675 --> 01:42:30.377
SOCIETY AS PRODUCTIVE CITIZENS

01:42:30.444 --> 01:42:32.646
OF SOCIETY. AND IF WE DO NOT

01:42:32.713 --> 01:42:34.515
HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT A

01:42:34.581 --> 01:42:36.083
PRODUCTIVE CITIZEN AS SOCIETY

01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:37.017
LOOKS LIKE THROUGH THE STAFF

01:42:37.084 --> 01:42:38.485
THAT WORK THERE. THEN HOW DO

01:42:38.552 --> 01:42:39.720

NEED TO BE MORE PERSISTENT IN

01:42:50.898 --> 01:42:51.932
MAKING SURE THAT THOSE THAT

01:42:51.999 --> 01:42:55.235
HAVE. CONTRACTED THE VIRUS FROM

01:42:55.302 --> 01:42:57.037
THE STAFF INSIDE THEY GET THE

01:42:57.104 --> 01:42:58.171
THINGS THAT THEY NEED BECAUSE

01:42:58.238 --> 01:42:59.473
EVERYBODY CANNOT BE PROVIDED

PROVIDING THOSE THINGS FOR US.

01:43:09.416 --> 01:43:12.819

01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:52.639
ARE HAND SANITIZERS READILY

01:46:52.706 --> 01:46:54.941
AVAILABLE OR ARE THOSE STILL

01:46:55.008 --> 01:46:57.544
CONSIDERED CONTRABAND- AND MOST

01:46:57.611 --> 01:47:01.782
IMPORTANTLY- PROTOCOL. DIFFER

01:47:01.848 --> 01:47:04.351
FROM PRISON TO PRISON FACILITY

01:47:04.417 --> 01:47:08.855
AND EACH WARRANT IS SETTING UP

01:47:08.922 --> 01:47:10.323
A LOT OF THE PROTOCOL FOR THEIR

01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:11.558
FACILITY AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE

01:47:11.625 --> 01:47:13.527
LEARNED IN DISCUSSIONS WITH CDC

01:47:13.593 --> 01:47:21.301
ARE OVER THE PAST FEW. MONTHS

01:47:21.368 --> 01:47:23.603
MERCEDES THE EACH FACILITY IS

01:47:23.670 --> 01:47:24.671
DIFFERENT. AND THEY ALL HAVE A

01:47:24.738 --> 01:47:28.308
DIFFERENT LAW OF LAUGHING. AND

01:47:28.375 --> 01:47:28.942
THAT'S VERY ONE OF TO ANOTHER

01:47:29.009 --> 01:47:30.043

01:47:30.110 --> 01:47:32.479
WITH FOR THEIR OWN FACILITY AND

01:47:32.546 --> 01:47:35.715
HOW THEY MEET THE STANDARDS. SO

01:47:35.782 --> 01:47:38.652

WOMEN CAN BE. PREGNANT AND. I

02:02:33.713 --> 02:02:35.481
KNOW THAT IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR

A BABY TO BE ABLE TO. TOUCH THE
