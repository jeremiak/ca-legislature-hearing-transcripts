00:14:37.076 --> 00:14:39.178
UNLICENSED PRACTICE DIRECTLY

00:14:39.245 --> 00:14:41.280
YOU COULD NEVER HAVE ENOUGH- I

00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:42.815
THINK WE DO A VERY GOOD JOB

00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:44.717
WITH THE RESOURCES WE HAVE. WE

00:14:44.783 --> 00:14:46.652
WOULD CERTAINLY TAKE MORE DOWN

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:48.020
THE ROAD I'M HAPPY TO LOOK AT

00:14:48.087 --> 00:14:49.855
WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE AND

00:14:49.922 --> 00:14:51.123
CIRCLE BACK TO YOU SO THE

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.057
PERHAPS THERE'S SOMETHING WE

00:14:52.124 --> 00:14:53.559
CAN WORK ON THROUGH. THE BUDGET

00:14:53.626 --> 00:14:55.527
PROCESS POTENTIALLY. AND DID I

00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:57.863
UNDERSTAND- YESTERDAY FROM OUR

00:14:57.930 --> 00:14:59.498
MEETING THAT THE FINES THAT ARE

00:14:59.565 --> 00:15:02.034
COLLECTED. AND I THINK IT MAXES

00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:03.435
OUT AT TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OR

00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:04.837
SOMETHING DID I UNDERSTAND THAT

00:15:04.903 --> 00:15:07.072
THEY DO NOT COME TO YOU. SO

00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:08.540
THERE'S NOT THIS FINANCIAL

00:15:08.607 --> 00:15:11.176
INCENTIVE FOR YOU. TO GO AFTER

00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:13.712
UNLICENSED ACTIVITY IS THAT

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:17.016
CORRECT. LET ME CLARIFY- I NEED

00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:18.617
TO VERIFY WHETHER FISCAL STAFF

00:15:18.684 --> 00:15:19.685
BUT IT'S BEEN MY UNDERSTANDING

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:21.553
TRADITIONALLY WITH LICENSING

00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:24.556
BOARDS THAT- THE PENALTIES THE

00:15:24.623 --> 00:15:26.258
MONETARY PENALTIES ARE INDEED

00:15:26.325 --> 00:15:28.127
DEPOSITED AND ARE FUND I THINK

00:15:28.193 --> 00:15:28.894
THE POINT I WAS TRYING TO

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:30.863
ARTICULATE. AND I APOLOGIZE IF

00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:33.499
I WASN'T CLEAR- WAS SIMPLY THAT

00:15:33.565 --> 00:15:35.467
CITATIONS AND THE PENALTIES

00:15:35.534 --> 00:15:37.102
ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. ARE

00:15:37.169 --> 00:15:39.071
REALLY NOT A COST RECOVERY

00:15:39.138 --> 00:15:40.472
MECHANISM SO WE CAN HAVE A

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:42.274
CITATION AGAINST UNLICENSED

00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:44.276
INDIVIDUAL. WITH A FIVE HUNDRED

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:46.345
DOLLAR PENALTY AND OUR OUR

00:15:46.412 --> 00:15:48.147
COSTS MORE ALL IN MIGHT BE.

00:15:48.213 --> 00:15:49.848
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THAT SO

00:15:49.915 --> 00:15:51.350
THEY'RE JUST. THEY'RE DESIGNED

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:52.951
TO BE A PENALTY AND IMPACTFUL

00:15:53.018 --> 00:15:54.753
BUT NOT NECESSARILY TO RECOVER

00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.322
FULL COVERAGE WOULD TODAY HAVE

00:15:56.388 --> 00:15:58.223
REALIZED ANY REVENUE FROM A

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:01.293
FALL SALE. OF IN A WAY THAT

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.295
THEY'RE ACTUALLY MAKING MORE%

00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:04.963
MONEY THAN THE COST OF THE

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:07.066
PENALTY FOR YOU JUST DEALING

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:08.467
WITH THEM ON ON THE LICENSED

00:16:08.534 --> 00:16:12.037
WITHOUT THEM ACTUALLY HAVING

00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:12.671
ENGAGED IN A TRANSACTION. WE'RE

00:16:12.738 --> 00:16:14.273
WE'RE DEALING ON THE ON THE ON

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.541
LICENSE THE OTHER REALM WHERE

00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:16.642
THAT WOULD BE ADDRESSABLE

00:16:16.709 --> 00:16:19.812
CRIMINAL OR CIVIL. AND THEN-

00:16:19.878 --> 00:16:22.214
LASTLY DO YOU THINK THE LEVEL

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:25.150
OF THE PENALTY IS INADEQUATE A

00:16:25.217 --> 00:16:26.385
DETERRENT YOU'RE NOT SEEING

00:16:26.452 --> 00:16:27.820
SOMEBODY COME BACK AROUND

00:16:27.886 --> 00:16:29.088
BECAUSE THE PENALTY ISN'T

00:16:29.154 --> 00:16:31.056
ENOUGH TO REALLY DO ANYTHING

00:16:31.123 --> 00:16:33.258
BUT PASSED AWAY IN ONE

00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:35.861
SITUATION. THE CENTER I THINK

00:16:35.928 --> 00:16:37.262
YOU COULD MAKE THE CASE THAT

00:16:37.329 --> 00:16:39.098
THE NUMBER COULD POTENTIALLY.

00:16:39.164 --> 00:16:40.466
BE HIGHER BUT THERE'S A COFFEE

00:16:40.532 --> 00:16:43.035
GUY IT'S TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

00:16:43.102 --> 00:16:44.803
DOLLARS BUT IT'S TWENTY FIVE

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:45.971
HUNDRED DOLLARS PER ACCOUNT SO

00:16:46.038 --> 00:16:48.240
IF I HAVE AN UNLICENSED. PERSON

00:16:48.307 --> 00:16:50.342
WHO DOES FIVE DONE DUMB

00:16:50.409 --> 00:16:52.177
UNSEEMLY THINGS WE CAN BRING

00:16:52.244 --> 00:16:54.947
THEM UP FOR FIVE CITATIONS AT.

00:16:55.013 --> 00:16:55.581
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED HOWEVER IF

00:16:55.647 --> 00:16:56.749
YOU HAVE A SITUATION WHERE IT

00:16:56.815 --> 00:16:58.384
WAS A SINGULAR COUNT THEN YOU

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.385
MIGHT WANT SOMETHING MORE

00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:01.353
IMPACTFUL THAN TWENTY FIVE

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.154
HUNDRED DOLLARS. AND THEN THE

00:17:02.221 --> 00:17:03.155
OTHER SIDE OF THE COIN IS

00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:04.289
ACTUALLY COLLECTING IT BECAUSE

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:06.091
THESE ARE LEGAL OPERATORS SO

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:07.626
THEY'RE GONNA. CLAIM

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:09.228
UNDERGROUND MAY BE DIFFICULT TO

00:17:09.294 --> 00:17:10.796
FIND WE DO HAVE SOME TOOLS WE

00:17:10.863 --> 00:17:12.264

HAVE. THE INTERCEPTOR OF RAM-

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.469
WITH THE TAX AGENCIES BUT IT

00:17:17.536 --> 00:17:19.004
CERTAINLY COULD BE SOMETHING TO

00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:19.905
LOOK AT WIH RESPECT TO THE

00:17:19.972 --> 00:17:22.207
DOLLAR AMOUNT. IT WAS SET AT

00:17:22.274 --> 00:17:22.741
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR

00:17:22.808 --> 00:17:24.476
SOMETIME AGO I WOULD I WOULD

THAT THERE'S AN APPROPRIATE WHY

REALLY ADDRESSING ANY LEVEL OF

00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:38.677

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:06.972
THINGS THAT WE COULD DO IS A

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:08.507
GOVERNMENT TO MAKE IT EASIER.

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:10.776
ON THE FOLKS THAT ARE SUBJECT

00:20:10.842 --> 00:20:11.910
TO THIS RATHER THAN JUST TO

HAND THEM SOME DOCUMENT DIDN'T

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:14.980
EVEN HAVE YOUR LOGO ON IT

KIND OF SLOPPY TOGETHER NINE I

CHALLENGING AND WE JUST THINK

00:20:22.154 --> 00:20:23.221

00:20:23.288 --> 00:20:24.723
DO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT WE

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.558
INTERFACE WITH THE PUBLIC. WE

00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:27.659
THINK ABOUT THEM WHEN THEY

00:20:27.726 --> 00:20:28.860
THINK ABOUT THEIR CONDITIONS

00:20:28.927 --> 00:20:29.795
AND THINK ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE

00:20:29.861 --> 00:20:31.129
WHEN THEY GET A DOCUMENT FOR A

00:20:31.196 --> 00:20:31.797
PIECE OF PAPER FROM THE

00:20:31.863 --> 00:20:33.532

AND SIMPLE ON THEM AS POSSIBLE

00:20:36.068 --> 00:20:37.436
AND GO THE EXTRA DISTANCE

00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:39.404
BEYOND JUST THE MINIMALIST

00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:40.539
APPROACH WHICH WAS DONE IN

00:20:40.606 --> 00:20:41.440

JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT ON

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:47.212
THE RECORD. IS THINK IT'S

00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:48.914
REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:20:48.981 --> 00:20:50.782
TAKE THE TIME AND DO THAT THE

00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:53.452
SECOND THING. WAS THE WAIT

00:20:53.518 --> 00:20:54.219
TIMES FOR PEOPLE WHEN THEY CALL

LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR AND I

00:48:57.067 --> 00:48:58.568

00:49:41.578 --> 00:49:42.612
LIKE FORTY FIVE STATES WHO HAVE

00:49:42.679 --> 00:49:44.548
THE CERTIFICATION BUT I THINK

00:49:44.614 --> 00:49:45.682
THE DEVIL IS ALWAYS IN THE

TO TRY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION

00:50:10.874 --> 00:50:12.976

00:50:13.043 --> 00:50:16.213
OF LEGISLATIVE- DISCUSSION THIS

00:50:16.279 --> 00:50:18.749

00:50:45.976 --> 00:50:47.043
THE DAY MUCH OF THE

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:49.045
INFRASTRUCTURE IS ALREADY THERE

00:50:49.112 --> 00:50:52.516
THROUGH. APPLE'S IMPLEMENTED.

00:50:52.582 --> 00:50:54.451

STRUCTURE ALREADY EXISTS. M. I

THINK COMMISSIONER ALONG IS

RIGHT ON THE MONEY I THINK THE

00:51:01.425 --> 00:51:02.359
ISSUE IS GOING TO BE THE

00:51:02.426 --> 00:51:04.094
DEVIL'S IN THE DETAILS AND HOW

00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:06.396
THE IMPLEMENTATION. AND HOW WE

00:51:06.463 --> 00:51:07.764
ACTUALLY GET TO A STRUCTURE

00:51:07.831 --> 00:51:09.766
THAT WORKS FOR ALL BUT I THINK

00:51:09.833 --> 00:51:11.835
THAT I WOULD JOIN PROBABLY ALL

00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:14.438

REALLY THE SCOPE OF POSTERS IN

00:52:08.358 --> 00:52:09.693
TWO THINGS TRAINING AND POLICE

00:52:09.759 --> 00:52:11.094
PRACTICES AND SELECTION

00:52:11.161 --> 00:52:12.896
STANDARDS AND I THINK MY

00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:14.197
COLLEAGUES HAVE DONE A GREAT

00:52:14.264 --> 00:52:15.765
JOB OF SORT OF GETTING INTO

00:52:15.832 --> 00:52:18.101
SOME OF THE ISSUES OF TRAINING

00:52:18.168 --> 00:52:20.604
AND POLICE ARE PRACTICES SO I

00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:22.839
HAD ONE QUESTION I THOUGHT I

00:52:22.906 --> 00:52:25.008
WOULD START WITH JEFF LONG AND

00:52:25.075 --> 00:52:26.510
THAT IS ON THE SELECTION

00:52:26.576 --> 00:52:29.613
STANDARDS I KNOW IN SOME WAYS

00:52:29.679 --> 00:52:31.848
IT AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS I

00:52:31.915 --> 00:52:33.783
KNOW IN SOME WAYS THEY'RE WROTE

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:35.418
OR THEY'RE OUT THERE BUT HOW DO

00:52:35.485 --> 00:52:37.487
YOU DEAL. WITH THE ISSUES OF

00:52:37.554 --> 00:52:40.690
DIVERSITY IN RECRUITMENT OF

00:52:40.757 --> 00:52:42.526
WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR

00:52:42.592 --> 00:52:44.494
AGAINST A SELECTION STANDARDS

00:52:44.561 --> 00:52:46.496
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU CAN DO

00:52:46.563 --> 00:52:48.598
THAT CAN FACILITATE THAT

00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:49.766
DIVERSITY OR THERE ARE THINGS

00:52:49.833 --> 00:52:51.835
YOU OF OBSERVE GENERATIONS THAT

00:52:51.902 --> 00:52:54.704
MIGHT BE IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S

00:52:54.771 --> 00:52:56.606
ARENA ON THAT. WELL THANK YOU

00:52:56.673 --> 00:52:59.476
CENTER LAYERED- I THINK

00:52:59.543 --> 00:53:01.511
SELECTION IS A HUGE ISSUE I

00:53:01.578 --> 00:53:03.079
THINK DIVERSITY IS A HUGE ISSUE

00:53:03.146 --> 00:53:04.848
IT IS NOT HERE TO FOR REALLY

00:53:04.915 --> 00:53:08.585
BEEN- AN ISSUE FOR POST BECAUSE

00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:09.953
THE SELECTION STANDARDS ARE

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:12.622
LARGELY STATUTORY IN POSTAL

00:53:12.689 --> 00:53:13.924
WE'RE ON SOME ADDITIONAL

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:15.458
STANDARDS MAYBE IN TERMS OF.

00:53:15.525 --> 00:53:19.195
EDUCATION OR OR- THINGS LIKE

00:53:19.262 --> 00:53:21.331
THAT AS VERY LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:53:21.398 --> 00:53:23.099
AGENCIES CARE ON TOP OF THAT

00:53:23.166 --> 00:53:25.101
BUT IN TERMS OF SELECTIONS

00:53:25.168 --> 00:53:26.536
ESPECIALLY REACHING OUT FOR

00:53:26.603 --> 00:53:28.805
DIVERSITY. IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE

00:53:28.872 --> 00:53:33.310
REALLY GOT TO LOOK AT. THE

00:53:33.376 --> 00:53:37.247
NUMBERS- THE NUMBERS ARE-

00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:39.215
THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT- PURCHASE

00:53:39.282 --> 00:53:41.284
OF THE- POPULATION IS WHITE YOU

00:53:41.351 --> 00:53:44.854
KNOW AND BUT 52% OF- POLICE

00:53:44.921 --> 00:53:46.723
OFFICERS OR WHAT THE BIGGEST BY

00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:49.326
FAR- DISCREPANCIES WITH WOMEN

00:53:49.392 --> 00:53:52.228
ONLY ABOUT 14% OF THE SOURCES

00:53:52.295 --> 00:53:54.397
OF. WITH OBVIOUSLY MORE THAN

00:53:54.464 --> 00:53:55.599
HALF OF THE POPULATION WELL AS

00:53:55.665 --> 00:53:57.434
SOMETHING THAT HAS GREAT

00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:59.102
RAMIFICATIONS FOR I THINK WHOSE

00:53:59.169 --> 00:54:01.237
LEGITIMACY AND- TRUST AND

00:54:01.304 --> 00:54:03.173
TRANSPARENCY AND SO FORTH SO.

00:54:03.239 --> 00:54:05.108
WE'VE GOT TO TRY TO ENGAGE IN A

00:54:05.175 --> 00:54:07.010
WAY TO ENCOURAGE MORE DIVERSITY

00:54:07.077 --> 00:54:08.411
IN TERMS OF HIRING THERE HAVE

00:54:08.478 --> 00:54:10.981
BEEN SOME SOME EFFORTS- THE

00:54:11.047 --> 00:54:13.516
EEOC SAID- DEAL J. AS IN

00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:18.855
ADVANCING. SURE DIVERSITY

00:54:18.922 --> 00:54:21.725
TRAINING IN AND- SELECTION AND

00:54:21.791 --> 00:54:23.326
RECRUITMENT. IT IS NOT

00:54:23.393 --> 00:54:24.227
SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE DUE FOR

00:54:24.294 --> 00:54:26.129
POSTERS REALLY ENGAGED AND I

00:54:26.196 --> 00:54:27.530
THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL

00:54:27.597 --> 00:54:31.735
BE TALKED ABOUT- COMING FOR

00:54:31.801 --> 00:54:32.535
WHETHER IT'S AS SIMPLE AS A

00:54:32.602 --> 00:54:34.070
SEPARATE STATEMENTS OF INTENT

00:54:34.137 --> 00:54:35.672
OR WHETHER IT'S TRYING TO MAYBE

00:54:35.739 --> 00:54:38.508
EVEN DO. SOME TYPE OF-

00:54:38.575 --> 00:54:39.109
CERTAINLY TO FIND OUT EXACTLY

00:54:39.175 --> 00:54:40.744
WHAT THE VARIOUS AGENCIES ARE

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:42.545
DOING AND WHAT IS WHAT IS NOT

00:54:42.612 --> 00:54:44.881
ORANGE FRUIT WELL I SEE THAT.

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:47.717
IT IS A MAN FROM WHAT YOU SAY

00:54:47.784 --> 00:54:49.719
POST DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF

00:54:49.786 --> 00:54:51.821
DISCRETION BUT PULSE. COLLECTS

00:54:51.888 --> 00:54:54.090
DISTANT THE STATISTICS AND

00:54:54.157 --> 00:54:55.825
MONITORS THE SITUATION IN A WAY

00:54:55.892 --> 00:54:57.894
THAT YOU CONNECT TO VIA. THE

00:54:57.961 --> 00:54:58.962
KNOWLEDGE THAT YOU JUST

00:54:59.029 --> 00:55:01.264
EXPRESSED IT MARKED REFLECT ON

00:55:01.331 --> 00:55:03.933
THIS I MEAN IS. IF FOR EXAMPLE

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.103
THERE'S ONE PROPOSAL. I DON'T

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:09.539
WANT TO GET. TO INTO. OUR

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:10.940
LEGISLATION BUT THERE'S ONE

00:55:11.007 --> 00:55:12.442
PROPOSAL THAT WOULD SORT OF

00:55:12.509 --> 00:55:15.912
LIFT THE AGE TO GO IN AND IT IN

00:55:15.979 --> 00:55:17.647
SOMETHING LIKE THAT BASED ON

00:55:17.714 --> 00:55:19.649
STATISTICS DO YOU HAVE SOME

00:55:19.716 --> 00:55:21.584
VIEW THAT THAT WOULD AFFECT

00:55:21.651 --> 00:55:23.420
DIVERSITY AND SOMEONE. OUR

00:55:23.486 --> 00:55:25.121
PERSONAL VIEW ON THAT A LITTLE

00:55:25.188 --> 00:55:26.189
BIT OF A CONCERN BUT I WOULD

00:55:26.256 --> 00:55:28.458
SAY THAT I DO AGREE WITH YOU

00:55:28.525 --> 00:55:29.592
CENTER THE POST IS IN

00:55:29.659 --> 00:55:31.695
POSSESSION OF STATISTICS AND

00:55:31.761 --> 00:55:33.329
WRITE AFFECTED THINKING APRIL.

00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:34.764
WHAT REPORT OUT THERE WILL

00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:36.733
BREAK DOWN THE ACADEMY'S- IN

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:38.668
TERMS OF DIVERSITY AND THAT

00:55:38.735 --> 00:55:39.936
WILL BE A VERY INTERESTING I

00:55:40.003 --> 00:55:41.071
THINK WE SHOULD GO FOR PERSONAL

00:55:41.137 --> 00:55:42.605
I THINK WE SHOULD GO FURTHER.

00:55:42.672 --> 00:55:44.407
AND LOOK AT DEPARTMENTS DO SOME

00:55:44.474 --> 00:55:45.775
ADDITIONAL REPORTING AND FIND

00:55:45.842 --> 00:55:47.210
OUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE VARIOUS

00:55:47.277 --> 00:55:48.478
BREAKDOWNS ARE AND WHAT'S

00:55:48.545 --> 00:55:50.714
WORKING IN TERMS OF THEIR-

00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:51.514
REACHING OUT IN TERMS OF

00:55:51.581 --> 00:55:54.384
DIVERSITY- IN TERMS OF RAISING

00:55:54.451 --> 00:55:56.686
THE AGE AS- RAGING EDUCATIONAL

00:55:56.753 --> 00:55:58.455
LEVEL. WELL THOSE ARE THOSE ARE

00:55:58.521 --> 00:55:59.489
THOSE ARE INTERESTING THINGS TO

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:00.724
TALK ABOUT I ALSO THINK WE HAVE

00:56:00.790 --> 00:56:03.059
TO BE CAREFUL BY MAYBE THE M.

00:56:03.126 --> 00:56:04.928
TEN CONSEQUENCES OF ACTUALLY

00:56:04.994 --> 00:56:06.396
MAKING NARROWING. THE

00:56:06.463 --> 00:56:08.798
POPULATIONS THAT WE ARE SEEKING

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:10.700
TO INCREASE TO THE EXTENT THAT

00:56:10.767 --> 00:56:12.902
WE DON'T ACCOMPANY SUCH THINGS

00:56:12.969 --> 00:56:14.971
AS- ADDITIONAL EDUCATION

00:56:15.038 --> 00:56:16.272
REQUIREMENTS SAY COLLEGE

00:56:16.339 --> 00:56:18.942
DEGREES OR ORIGINALLY AGE TO

00:56:19.008 --> 00:56:20.610
TWENTY FIVE WE DON'T. IF WE

00:56:20.677 --> 00:56:23.847
DON'T ATTACHED TO THOSE THINGS-

00:56:23.913 --> 00:56:24.481
DIFFERENT STANDARDS FOR

00:56:24.547 --> 00:56:26.816
REACHING OUT AND LOOKING AT THE

00:56:26.883 --> 00:56:28.218
POPULATIONS THAT WE'RE SEEKING

00:56:28.284 --> 00:56:29.586
IF WE DON'T TIE THOSE TWO

00:56:29.652 --> 00:56:30.186
THINGS TOGETHER I THINK THERE

00:56:30.253 --> 00:56:30.954
COULD BE UNINTENDED

00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:33.890
CONSEQUENCES. OF SUCH A BILL MY

00:56:33.957 --> 00:56:36.326
OWN JUST IN MY OWN OPINION TECH

00:56:36.392 --> 00:56:38.194
PARTNERSHIPS AT NIGHT. IF I

00:56:38.261 --> 00:56:39.529
HAVE TO RECOUNT A STORY AS

00:56:39.596 --> 00:56:41.698
USUAL AND- I WAS SPEAKING AT

00:56:41.765 --> 00:56:43.366
THE GRADUATION OF THE BATCH LAW

00:56:43.433 --> 00:56:45.168
ENFORCEMENT FOR PARK RANGERS

00:56:45.235 --> 00:56:45.969
AND I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:56:46.035 --> 00:56:47.804
DIVERSITY. AND THE FRONT THERE

00:56:47.871 --> 00:56:50.106
WERE FIFTY IN THE FRONT ROW THE

00:56:50.173 --> 00:56:51.107
SEVEN OF THEM WERE ALL WOMEN I

00:56:51.174 --> 00:56:52.642
WAS VERY EXCITED AND THEN I

00:56:52.709 --> 00:56:54.711
REALIZED. THAT THESE VERY

00:56:54.778 --> 00:57:02.986
SEATED. THEM IN ORDER OF THEIR

00:57:03.052 --> 00:57:03.820
HEIGHT. THERE WERE SEVEN WOMEN

00:57:03.887 --> 00:57:04.888
IN ENTIRE. THEY WERE IN THE ROW

00:57:04.954 --> 00:57:06.222
THEY WERE THE SHORTEST AND SO.

00:57:06.289 --> 00:57:08.458
THE SOME FOR DIVERSE. LET ME

00:57:08.525 --> 00:57:09.592
FLY CALL. AND I HATE TO DO THIS

00:57:09.659 --> 00:57:10.560
THE MAIL OF THE OTHER

00:57:10.627 --> 00:57:12.028
CANDIDATES BUT I KNOW THERE

00:57:12.095 --> 00:57:13.596
WERE OTHER PEOPLE THERE DID

00:57:13.663 --> 00:57:15.231
ANYBODY HAVE ANYTHING THEY WISH

00:57:15.298 --> 00:57:16.966
TO ADD ON THAT ISSUE BEFORE WE

00:57:17.033 --> 00:57:20.270
MOVE ON. BUT SENATOR I WOULD

00:57:20.336 --> 00:57:22.138
SLIDE LIBRARY. YES PLEASE GO

00:57:22.205 --> 00:57:24.974
AHEAD SIR. YES THANK YOU YEAH

00:57:25.041 --> 00:57:26.876
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE

00:57:26.943 --> 00:57:28.945
STRUGGLED WITH AS A PROFESSION

00:57:29.012 --> 00:57:30.079
FOR A VERY LONG TIME I MEAN

00:57:30.146 --> 00:57:33.283
EVEN. WHEN I STARTED IN-

00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.850
NINETEEN A CERTAIN A STUDENT

00:57:33.917 --> 00:57:35.752
TRAINEE ACTUALLY IN NINETEEN

00:57:35.819 --> 00:57:36.519
NINETY TWO I WAS ONLY NINETEEN

00:57:36.586 --> 00:57:38.421
YEARS OLD WHEN MY AGENCY

00:57:38.488 --> 00:57:39.556
RECRUITED ME FROM THE LOCAL

00:57:39.622 --> 00:57:43.660
COLLEGE- AND I MEAN I'VE WORKED

00:57:43.726 --> 00:57:44.694
IT YOU KNOW TO HELP OUR

00:57:44.761 --> 00:57:46.729
RECRUITING A UNIT FOR MANY MANY

00:57:46.796 --> 00:57:49.866
YEARS AND NOW WE STILL AREN'T

00:57:49.933 --> 00:57:50.767
AT THE LEVELS THAT WE WANT TO

00:57:50.834 --> 00:57:53.369
BE- BUT I THINK PART OF THAT.

00:57:53.436 --> 00:57:55.872
IS DUE TO SOME OF THE

00:57:55.939 --> 00:57:57.607
RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE WITH

00:57:57.674 --> 00:58:00.109
US SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES- IT

00:58:00.176 --> 00:58:02.545
IN OUR AREA I THINK THAT THAT.

00:58:02.612 --> 00:58:04.180
THAT'S THE SAME FOR A LOT OF

00:58:04.247 --> 00:58:05.148
THE COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE

00:58:05.215 --> 00:58:08.651
NATION- WE HAVE MADE A LOT OF

00:58:08.718 --> 00:58:10.687
EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE-

00:58:10.753 --> 00:58:13.089
RELATIONSHIPS IN ORDER TO BE

00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:16.025
ABLE TO- RECRUIT FROM WITHIN-

00:58:16.092 --> 00:58:19.495
SO. AS I DO UNDERSTAND THE NEED

00:58:19.562 --> 00:58:23.132
AND THE VALUE AND DIVERSITY

00:58:23.199 --> 00:58:24.400
BECAUSE I MEAN I'M HERE AND I

00:58:24.467 --> 00:58:25.768
UTILIZE MY AGE MY LANGUAGE

00:58:25.835 --> 00:58:27.670
SKILLS AND- EFFECTIVE A WOMAN

00:58:27.737 --> 00:58:29.205
ALL THE TIME. TO HELP ME BE

00:58:29.272 --> 00:58:31.374
SUCCESSFUL IN THIS JOB BUT I

00:58:31.441 --> 00:58:33.209
CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW

00:58:33.276 --> 00:58:36.246
IMPORTANT IT IS. TO CONCENTRATE

00:58:36.312 --> 00:58:39.816
ON HOW WE TREAT PEOPLE OVERALL-

00:58:39.883 --> 00:58:41.451
CONTINUING WITH THE PROCEDURAL

00:58:41.517 --> 00:58:44.787
JUSTICE THE- TRAINING SO THAT

00:58:44.854 --> 00:58:46.556
YOU KNOW PEOPLE FEEL LIKE THEY

00:58:46.623 --> 00:58:48.358
HAVE BEEN TREATED FAIRLY BY THE

00:58:48.424 --> 00:58:51.160
JUSTICE SYSTEM. THAT'S HOW WE

00:58:51.227 --> 00:58:54.530
GET PEOPLE TO. ON SHOULDN'T

00:58:54.597 --> 00:58:56.599
HAVE TRUST IN US AS POLICE

00:58:56.666 --> 00:58:58.368
OFFICERS AND IN THIS PROFESSION

00:58:58.434 --> 00:59:00.103
SO THAT THEY WOULD WANT TO COME

00:59:00.169 --> 00:59:03.039
AND WORK HERE- IT ONLY TAKES

00:59:03.106 --> 00:59:04.574
ONE PERSON AND NO MATTER THEIR

00:59:04.641 --> 00:59:07.010
WHITE BLACK ASIAN OR WHATEVER

00:59:07.076 --> 00:59:08.177
TO YOU KNOW DO SOMETHING

00:59:08.244 --> 00:59:09.646
INAPPROPRIATE TO CREATE

00:59:09.712 --> 00:59:11.414
MISTRUST OR TO DESTROY IT IN A

00:59:11.481 --> 00:59:13.650
COMMUNITY- AND SO REALLY IT

00:59:13.716 --> 00:59:15.318
DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR RACE

00:59:15.385 --> 00:59:16.786
IS OR WHAT YOUR GENDER IS I

00:59:16.853 --> 00:59:19.355
THINK IT'S THE OVER OVERALL WAY

00:59:19.422 --> 00:59:21.190
IN WHICH WE TREAT PEOPLE THAT

00:59:21.257 --> 00:59:23.660
MATTERS MOST AND I THINK WE

00:59:23.726 --> 00:59:24.193
NEED TO. MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:25.728
SHOULD FOCUS ON THAT. THANK YOU

00:59:25.795 --> 00:59:26.996
I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU AND

00:59:27.063 --> 00:59:29.632
I THINK- SERGEANT RAMIREZ

00:59:29.699 --> 00:59:33.703
WANTED TO ALSO COMMENT ON THIS.

00:59:33.770 --> 00:59:35.171
YES HI I WAS JUST GONNA SAY

00:59:35.238 --> 00:59:36.639
THAT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO

00:59:36.706 --> 00:59:39.976
A BETTER JOB OF RECRUITING-

00:59:40.043 --> 00:59:42.745
WOMEN. AND MINORITIES OUT BY

00:59:42.812 --> 00:59:43.880
GOING ON THE FIELD BUT I DON'T

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:45.148
THINK THAT'S ANYTHING THAT'S

00:59:45.214 --> 00:59:48.251
HOST REALLY. ARM CAN CONTROL I

00:59:48.318 --> 00:59:50.119
THINK IT'S MORE ON THE AGENCIES

00:59:50.186 --> 00:59:51.688
THEMSELVES THAT THEY NEED TO

00:59:51.754 --> 00:59:53.556
GET OUT IN THE MORE. ARE

00:59:53.623 --> 00:59:56.726
DIVERSE AREAS- BUT KIND OF ON

00:59:56.793 --> 00:59:57.794
WHAT LINE I SAID YOU KNOW IT

00:59:57.860 --> 00:59:59.262
ALSO DEPENDS ON THE

00:59:59.329 --> 01:00:00.129
RELATIONSHIP YOU HAVE WITH THE

01:00:00.196 --> 01:00:01.965
COMMUNITY WHETHER THEY WANT TO

01:00:02.031 --> 01:00:03.299
LET YOU AND THEY'RE TO DO

01:00:03.366 --> 01:00:04.901
THINGS OR NOT BUT YOU KNOW.

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:05.468
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:06.736
THINGS DIFFERENT AGENCIES YOU

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:09.272
CAN TRY. TO RECRUIT FEMALES AND

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:10.640
THAT'S YOU KNOW GOING TO ALL

01:00:10.707 --> 01:00:12.108
WOMEN EVENTS LIKE YOU KNOW ALL

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:13.710
WOMEN RUNS WELL WHEN BEFORE

01:00:13.776 --> 01:00:15.912
CALVET- BUT WE JUST NEED TO GET

01:00:15.979 --> 01:00:16.980
OUT THERE MORE AND I THINK WE

01:00:17.046 --> 01:00:18.214
NEED TO GET OUR WOMEN OUT THERE

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:20.783
MORE. SENDING MEN OUT TO THOSE-

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.652
TYPE OF EVENTS TO TRY TO QUIT-

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:24.420
RECRUIT WOMEN DOESN'T ALWAYS

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:26.556
WORK THE BEST SO I THINK THAT.

01:00:26.622 --> 01:00:27.523
WE HAVE TO PUT A LOT MORE ON

01:00:27.590 --> 01:00:29.158
THE AGENCIES INDIVIDUALLY TO GO

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:30.760
OUT AND I KNOW PERSONALLY OUR

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:32.195
AGENCY TRIED TO RECRUIT WOMEN

01:00:32.261 --> 01:00:33.262
AND I'VE BEEN IN INTERVIEWS

01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:34.564

I'M GOOD I DON'T. THIS REALLY

01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:38.601
ISN'T WHAT I WANT TO DO. HOW DO

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:40.570
THEY GO TO ALL. SO I THINK IT'S

01:00:40.636 --> 01:00:42.205
JUST- A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT

01:00:42.271 --> 01:00:43.740

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:45.241
THE IMAGE THAT WE KEEP AND-

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:47.143
MAKING WANTED. PEOPLE WANT TO

01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:48.711
DO THIS AND UNFORTUNATELY PRESS

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:50.179
RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A- STRANGE

01:00:50.246 --> 01:00:52.215
TIME WHERE WE'RE GETTING A LOT

TRY TO. TRY TWICE AS HARD NOW

01:01:04.227 --> 01:01:05.561
