ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION FOUR BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER CRISTINA GARCIA AN ACT RELATING RELATIVE TO THE BASEL CONVENTION. STERN FOR GEORGE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE TO PRESENT A J. R. FOUR WHICH CALLS FOR THE UNITED STATES RATIFICATION OF THE BASEL AGREEMENT A CRITICAL STEP IN PROPERLY REGULATING THE INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE A PLASTIC DUMPING ON DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE BASEL CONVENTION RESOLUTION ON THE CONTROL OF TRANSBOUNDARY MOVEMENTS OF HAZARDOUS WASTES AND THEIR DISPOSAL WAS SIGNED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE BUT IS NEVER ACTUALLY RATIFIED BY THE UNITED STATES. RATIFYING THIS AGREEMENT WILL SHOW THE U. S. WOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR ROLE IN THE PLASTICS CRISIS IN THAT WERE WILLING TO WORK TOWARDS SOLUTIONS WE KNOW THAT MANY MEMBERS IN THIS THIS LEGISLATURE INCLUDING SENATORS FROM SANTA MONICA AND FREMONT HAVE BEEN WORKING HARD ON THESE ISSUES BUT- THIS IS ALSO AN INTERNATIONAL ISSUE WHERE. PLASTIC IS FLOATING THE SIZE OF TEXAS AND THE PACIFIC OCEAN THERE'S AN ISLAND AND IT'S IMPACTING CLUTCHES OCEAN LIFE BUT MATERNITY HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE THROUGHOUT OUR REGION INCLUDING JAPAN THE PHILIPPINES AUSTRALIA PERU ALL THE WAY THE UNITED STATES NO ONE IS SPARED. THE UNITED STATES IS NOW ONE OF ONLY A FEW COUNTRIES THAT FAIL TO RATIFY THIS VITAL MULTINATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGREEMENT. TO PROTECT DEVELOPING COUNTRIES FROM THE EXPORT AND DUMPING OF WASTE FROM OUR RICHER INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES. IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE BASEL CONVENTION WAS AMENDED TO INCLUDE MIXED AND CONTAMINATED PLASTIC WASTE SHIPMENTS WITHIN ITS CONTROL PROCEDURE. YES THE PROBLEM OF PLASTIC WASTE COLLECTED FOR RECYCLING INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS AND SENT TO HIGHLY POLLUTING WRIST RECYCLING OPERATIONS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. IN THESE LOCATIONS THE PLASTIC WASTE IS OFTEN DUMPED AND BURNED RED AND SAFELY RECYCLE. AS OF JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE SUCH EXPORTS REQUIRE THE NOTIFICATION AND CONSENT OF RECEIVING COUNTRIES PRIOR TO EXPORT. HOWEVER THE UNITED STATES NOT BEING ABOUT THE PARTY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LEGALLY EXPORT WAYS WHICH ARE ILLEGAL FOR THE IMPORTING COUNTRY TO RECEIVE LEADING TO ILLEGAL TRAFFIC SEIZURES LAWSUITS AND WASTE REPATRIATION OFFENSE. AJ ARE FOR URGES THE BY DEMONSTRATION TO ACT IMMEDIATELY TO RATIFY THE BASEL CONVENTION WHICH ADDRESSES THE GROWING CONCERN ABOUT THIS CRISIS ALL THE SCIENTIFIC DATA SHOWS THAT PLASTIC WASTE POSES AN EXISTENTIAL. THREAT NOT JUST TO THE PLANET BUT TO EACH OTHER AND SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THIS ITEM. IN NINETEEN NINE MONTH SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ALAN.

ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE SIXTY NINE BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GRAYSON AN ACT RELATING TO CONTRACTORS INNER COPIER. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE TO PRESENT AB FIVE SIXTY NINE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAYSON. THIS BILL RAISES THE MAXIMUM CAP ON CIVIL PENALTY FEES FOR CONTRACTORS WHO VIOLATE CONTRACTOR LAW. ON AVERAGE ONLY ABOUT 3% OF CONTRACTORS VIOLATE THE CONTRACTOR LINER SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTY FEES EACH YEAR. BUT FOR THE FEW BAD ACTORS THAT EXIST CIVIL PENALTY FEES ARE AN IMPORTANT TOOL TO DETER VIOLATING A LAW HOWEVER THE CURRENT FEE CAPS ARE DECADES OUT OF DATE FOR MOST VIOLATIONS OF CONTRACTORS LAW THE MAXIMUM FEE THAT THE STATE CONTRACTORS LICENSE BOARD. CAN FIND A CONTRACTOR IS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH WAS SET OVER SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO FOR SPECIFIC VIOLATIONS CONSIDERED MUCH MORE EGREGIOUS CONTRACTORS CAN BE FINED UP TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THIS VIOLATION SPECIFIC MAXIMUM WAS ESTABLISHED TWENTY NINE YEARS AGO. IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO ADDITIONALLY WHEN A CONTRACTOR APPEAL THE CITATION IT NOW COSTS THE CSL BE AT LEAST TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO DEFEND IT IN COURT. PLUS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN EXPENSES FROM THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS. AB FIVE SIXTY NINE SOLVES THESE BY RAISING THE CAPS ON CIVIL PENALTY FEES TO BRING THEM IN LINE WITH THE CONCERN CURRENT CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FOR MOST VIOLATIONS OF CONTRACTORS LAW THE FEES WILL BE INCREASED TO A MAXIMUM OF EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND FOR MORE EGREGIOUS VIOLATIONS THE FEE WILL BE INCREASED TO UP TO THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS THIS MEASURE ALSO ALLOWS THE CSL BE TO ISSUE AN ADMONISHMENT LETTER. WHEN EDUCATION- PROOF OF COMPLIANCE IS DETERMINED TO BE A BETTER APPROACH THAN A CITATION SO THEY'RE THEY'RE THE FEET THE FINES WILL GO UP BUT THERE'S ALSO A WAY TO BE ABLE% TO GET A LETTER OF COMPLIANCE- AND- MANAGEMENT LETTER WHICH- WILL GUARANTEE COMPLIANCE AS WELL. A. B. FIVE SIXTY NINE WILL HELP OFFSET THE COSTS FACED BY THE CSL BE IN DEFENDING CITATIONS AGAINST BAD ACTORS AND ENSURE THE CIVIL PENALTY FEES REMAIN A VIABLE DETERRENT TO VIOLATING THE LAW. THIS COMMON SENSE APPROACH TO ALLOW THE CSL BE TO CONTINUE EFFECTIVELY REGULATING THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA.

HIS TRACK RECORD DISPLACES FERVENT DEVOTION TO ENSURING LGBTQ EQUALITY WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY AS WELL AS FIRM OPPOSITION TO THE WAR ON DRUGS CITING THE DISPROPORTIONATE DAMAGE TO INNER CITY COMMUNITIES.
