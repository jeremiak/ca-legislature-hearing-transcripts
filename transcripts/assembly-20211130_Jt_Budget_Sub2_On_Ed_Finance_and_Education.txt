EVERYBODY HERE IN ATTENDANCE- ALSO VIRTUALLY TO ROUTE FRTY TWO A TO THIS SPECIAL HEARING THIS MORNING WITH ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION FINANCE AS WELL AS THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE WHICH PROVIDES A SERVE ON AS WELL AS MR DONNELLY FROM A SECOND- I ALSO WANNA NOTE THIS IS OUR LAST TIME IN IN FORTY TWO A TO AN END OF AN ERA. IN THIS COMMITTEE ROOM ITSELF KIND OF EMOTIONAL FOR A LOT OF USHAVE BEEN HERE THE LAST THREE DECADES A LOT OF IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY HAS BEEN THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE ROOM BUT- THE SHOW WILL GO ON ACROSS THE STREET. THE MOVIE BACK HERE IN A FEW YEARS- THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY DURING THE FALL OF COURSE TO FOCUS ON OVERSIGHT. AND YOU KNOW THAT THE TOP ISSUE IN OUR STATE CONSTITUTION WE ALWAYS REMIND OURSELVES IS HIS PUBLIC EDUCATION AND THIS PANDEMIC REALLY HAS HAD AN IMPACT ON ALL OF US AND SO TODAY'S HEARING. WILL FOCUS ON EARLY SNAPSHOT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING RELATE TO STUDENT ENROLLMENT ATTENDANCE AND LEARNING RECOVERY AFTER THE RE OPENING OF OUR SCHOOLS. AFTER COVER NINETEEN I WILL NOTE THAT IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA OF HAD SOME HICCUPS WHAT I WAS AT A SCHOOL JUST YESTERDAY. AND THE PRINCIPAL REPORT THAT THE SUPERINTENDENT PRINCIPLE REPORTED THAT 95% OF THEIR KIDS ARE BACK AT IT LEARNING IN PERSON. ON TO THANK OUR FRONTLINE EDUCATORS. AT TODAY WE'LL HEAR. ABOUT DATA ON WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH OUR STUDENTS. AND CONSIDER- STATEWIDE ENROLLMENTS INTENDANTS TRENDS AND TAKE A- TAKE A SNAPSHOT WILL HAVE A DEEPER DIVE ON THIS LATER IN THE SPRING. OF THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING IS TO HEAR ABOUT THE TRANSIT IS BECAUSE THE IMPLICATIONS OF CALIFORNIANS CONTINUE STUDENT ENGAGEMENT CRISIS. NOT FOCUSING ON YOU KNOW THE FROM THE SCHOOL PERSPECTIVE ALWAYS WHICH WE WILL HEAR FROM THAT SUBCOMMITTEE PROCESS BUT HOW THIS IMPACTS OUR STUDENTS AND OUR FAMILIES AND FOCUSING ON. SENIOR RECOVERY- WITH A PANDEMIC THAT WE HAVE- RECEIVE TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN STABILIZATION FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WE NOW WITH OUR BOOMING ECONOMY WE HAVE THE STORY GROWTH AND PROP NINETY EIGHT. SO THE ISSUE FOCUS THE FOCUS I THINK THE ISSUE IS HOW WE WILL UTILIZE THESE WITH THESE RESOURCES TO. HELP STABILIZE SCHOOLS BUT ALSO MAKE SURE THAT NOT ONLY OUR SCHOOLS BUT OUR KIDS RECOVER THIS YEAR IN THE YEARS TO COME THE PREPARING ALL STUDENTS A TIP TIP TO US TO SUCCEED. SO WITH THAT WE HAVE A ROBUST- PANELS HERE THIS MORNING AS WELL AS OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT HE WAS HERE IN PERSON- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE STAY ON CONTRACT TODAY WITH. WITH OUR- AGENDA AND RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR CULTURE TODAY MISTER O'DONNELL COME BACK TO SOME- SOME HOUSEKEEPING ITEMS. I THINK THANK YOU- MISTER MCCARTY. AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY LEARN MORE. FROM OUR PRESENTERS TODAY AND I GUESS THIS IS OUR LAST TIME. IN THIS TERM SO- OR MOMENT WHAT THE IMPACT OF COVERT NINETEEN- THE COVER NINETEEN PANDEMIC CONTINUES TO PERMEATE EVERY ASPECT OF OUR DAILY LIVES. NO MORE SO THAN A PUBLIC EDUCATION IT'S FUNNY AROUND THE STATE MANY CITY HALLS ARE CLOSED. BUT SCHOOLS ARE OPEN SCHOOLS ARE OPEN AND SERVING CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN. THE PANDEMIC CREATES INNUMERABLE CHALLENGES FOR OUR K. TWELVE SYSTEM WHICH THE LEGISLATURE HAS MET HEAD ON WITH INCREASED FLEXIBILITIES AND MOST NOTABLY EXTORT INCREASES OF STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING. DESPITE THESE ACTIONS FROM SACRAMENTO IT IS CLEAR THAT OUR STUDENTS TEACHERS STAFF AND THE ENTIRE PUBLIC EDUCATION INFRASTRUCTURE THE STRUGGLING. DURING THIS PANDEMIC DAYS AS A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER YES I GO BACK IN THE CLASSROOM TEACHING MIDDLE SCHOOL- DAHLE FULL DAY OKAY THE REAL THING- MISTRAL DONNA WALKS CENTER PUTS HIS NAME ON THE BOARD AND TEACHERS ANY SUBJECT THAT MIGHT BE UP THAT DAY BECAUSE- WE HAD A SHORTAGE OF SUBSTITUTES SUBSTITUTES FOR SURE. AND SO IT'S ALWAYS INTERESTING TO GO BACK TO CLASS TO REALLY SEE WHAT'S GOING ON FIRST HAND I CAN TELL YOU IT'S EASIER TO SIT IN SACRAMENTO. AND TELL SCHOOLS TO OPEN. THAT IT IS TO OPEN A SCHOOL THAT IS TO OPERATE A SCHOOL DURING A PANDEMIC. SO I WILL RECOGNIZE THAT AND THANK OUR TEACHERS AND SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND CLASSIFIED STAFF ACROSS THE STATE. FOR ALL THEY'RE DOING TO SERVE CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN FROM MY OBSERVATION CLASS SIZES ARE TYPICALLY SMALL SMALLER BECAUSE- SOME STUDENTS ARE ABSENT FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS SOME OF THE COVERT RELATED I WOULD IMAGINE- BUT AGAIN IT'S AN INTERESTING MOMENT. SOME OF THE STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED STUDENTS INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAMS. SOME HAVE MOVED. SOME ARE NOT COMING TO SCHOOL ALL SUMMER ONLINE. SO THERE'S A VARIETY OF FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH SCHOOL ATTENDANCE. AND REMEMBER MANY OF THE STUDENTS LIVE IN MULTI GENERATIONAL HOUSEHOLDS RIGHT. HI SUMMER IS OUR STATE NOT SO PROBLEMS OTHERS ARE STATE VERY PREVALENT. AND SO THEY HAVE TO OFTENTIMES TAKE EXTRA CARE. NOT TO GIVE THE PEOPLE IN THE HOME ELEVEN COVERED BECAUSE THEY MIGHT BE ELDERLY THEY MIGHT BE HAVE ALL OF ORAL HEALTH STATUS. ALSO PEOPLE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT. TODAY I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FEAR OF MANY SCHOOL LEADERS THAT BECAUSE OF DECLINING ENROLLMENT AND CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM A PORTION. LEVELS WILL DROP. AND I THINK AT THE BUDGET LEVEL WE CAN WE CAN DO A LOT TO ADDRESS THAT. TO ENSURE THAT- CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FUNDING OVER HISTORIC NEXT YEAR WE WILL NOT SEE A DROP. JUST BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS ATTENDING CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS HAS DROPPED WE NEED TO KEEP CLIMBING- SO THAT WE CAN ADEQUATELY FUND OUR SCHOOLS IN FACT WE'RE STILL ONE OF THE LOWEST IN THE STATES ON A PER STUDENT. BASIS WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHANGE THAT. PLEASE PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT EVERY BUDGET PROJECTION FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO INCLUDES A SURPLUS THE L. A. O. ESTIMATES THAT NEARLY TWENTY BILLION. IS AVAILABLE TO ALLOCATE FOR SCHOOLS IN THE UPCOMING. BUDGET CYCLES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE AN URGENT STUDENT ENGAGEMENT CHALLENGE I WANT TO. ASSURE YOU THAT CALIFORNIA IS NOT FACING. A FUNDING CHALLENGE IN FACT WE HAVE A FUNDING OPPORTUNITY. WE KNOW THAT THE ISSUES FACING OUR L. A.'S ARE COMPLEX. OUR GOAL WITH TODAY'S JOINT HEARING IS TO UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE OF THE ISSUES LEARN ABOUT EFFORTS ALREADY UNDER WAY TO BRING STUDENTS. BACK INTO SCHOOL AND CONTEMPLATE WHAT ELSE OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM NEEDS TO HELP STUDENTS SUCCEED. IN THE CURRENT CONTEXT THE CURRENT SITUATION ANOTHER MAYBE OTHER MEMBERS- SOME OF A RAZOR MAJORITY LEADER DID YOU WISH TO SHARE ANY THOUGHTS. YES THANK YOU I WANT TO BEGIN BY THANKING OUR CHAIRS- RT MISTER DONALD. FOR CALLING THIS HEARING TODAY. AND ALSO WANT TO THANK THE STAFF OF SUB TWO AND THE ASSEMBLY EDUCATION COMMITTEE. I THINK THAT AS MENTIONED HOW WELL OUR STUDENTS HAVE RETURNED TO SCHOOL MOST OF THEM ANYWAY. THEY ARE STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES AND LEARNING LOSS RECOVERY AND CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM. AND WE RECOGNIZE FROM WHAT WE HAVE READ IT THAT THESE ISSUES ARE AFFECTING OUR BLACK AND LATINO STUDENTS ESPECIALLY AS WELL AS OUR FOSTERYOUTH AND STUDENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH HOMELESSNESS. THEY'RE THE ONES MOST AFFECTED AND I KNOW THAT WE'LL BE HEARING ABOUT THAT TODAY I THINK AS WE RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC OUR FOCUS MUST BE ON HOW WE CAN BEST SUPPORT. THE MENTAL HEALTH AND ENGAGEMENT OF OUR STUDENTS OUR TEACHERS AND OUR SCHOOL STAFF. I LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE. ESPECIALLY FROM OUR SUPERINTENDENT. TONY THURMOND. THE L. A. O. AND OTHER PRESENTERS WHO HAVE ANALYZE THE DATA THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN RECEIVED. AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING THE SUGGESTIONS ON HOW WE CAN BEST SUPPORT. THE RECOVERY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE LONG TERM. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUES ESPECIALLY. THE COMMENT ABOUT THE NEED TO ADEQUATELY FUND OUR SCHOOLS I AM HEARING FROM OUR SUPERINTENDENTS THEM THEY DO NOT THE ABSENTEEISM AND WANT TO BE SURE THAT THEY ARE PROPERLY FUNDED. SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS ESPECIALLY OUR SUPERINTENDENT- FOR THE PRESENTATIONS I KNOW THAT. IT'LL HELP US ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU WE WILL NOW PROCEED WITH THE HEARING I KNOW OUR SUPERINTENDENT. HAS A TIMELINE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE ARE HERE TO A SERVER THAT WE HAVE OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC INSTRUCTOR INSTRUCTION HERE- YOU KNOW NO STRANGER TO THIS CAPITAL NOR THIS ROOM HERE AT FORTY TWO A TO SELL. WELCOME AND AGAIN THIS WILL BE YOUR LAST TIME COMING TO THIS- THIS RUMORED FORTY TWO IT TOO SO. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AND YOU CAN ENLIGHTEN US ON SOME- ENROLLMENT TRENDS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND ISSUES TO CONSIDER AS WE MOVE FORWARD SUPERINTENDENT. I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MCCARTY CHAIRMAN ALL DONALD TO MAJORITY LEADERS TO THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO THE STAFF- TO EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS AND FAMILIES ALL ACROSS THE STATE- IT'S AN HONOR TO BE BEFORE YOU TONY THURMOND STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION- AS YOU'VE INDICATED- A ROOM THAT HAD A CHANCE TO BE IN MANY TIMES FOR EDUCATION HEARINGS AND HEALTH COMMITTEE HEARINGS. AND TO NOTE AS YOU HAVE INDICATED THAT THIS BUILDING IS TO BE DEMOLISHED TO BE BUILT BACK BETTER- AND WHILE IT'S SAD TO LEAVE THIS ROOM- I THINK THAT THE- THE METAPHOR OF BUILDING BACK IS SOMETHING FOR US TO THINK ABOUT- IN OUR SCHOOLS- YOU ALL HAVE FRAMED IT THIS IS- WITHOUT. QUESTION THE TOUGHEST TIME THAT ANY OF US IN THIS NATION HAVE EXPERIENCE AND OUR STUDENTS AND OUR FAMILIES THEY FEEL THE BRUNT OF THAT EVERY SINGLE MOMENT- I'VE HAD THE CHANCE SINCE SCHOOL STARTED EVEN SINCE BEFORE SCHOOL STARTED. SINCE AS EARLY AS JULY TO VISIT DOZENS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE AND OUR SCHOOLS ARE OPEN AND THEY ARE DOING THE IMPOSSIBLE UNDER WHAT FEELS LIKE IMPOSSIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES. THEY RECOGNIZE THAT WE'VE LOST LIVES TO THE PANDEMIC THEY RECOGNIZE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CHALLENGES RACIAL CHALLENGES AND SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES THEY RECOGNIZE THAT NINETEEN COUNTIES IN OUR STATE HAVE EXPERIENCE FIRE. SCHOOLS HAVE BURNED DOWN PEOPLE OF LOS THEIR HOMES THINGS HAVE BEEN A THE- AS YOU CAN IMAGINE. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THIS IS THE TOUGHEST TIME THAT WE WILL EXPERIENCE IN OUR LIFETIME- AND YOU CAN NAME ANY CHALLENGE THAT YOU WANT DOES ANYONE OF THEM COULD BE THE TOP. ISSUE STAFFING SHORTAGES- THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TODAY DECLINING ENROLLMENT. BUT I BELIEVE THAT OUR STUDENTS AND OUR SCHOOLS REPRESENT MORE THAN THE SUM OF OUR EXPERIENCES OUR STUDENTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED AN INCREDIBLE KIND OF RESILIENCE. OUR EDUCATORS CONTINUE TO LEAN IN TO GIVE THE BEST OUR FAMILIES CONTINUE TO LEAN IN TO GIVE THE BEST. TO OUR STUDENTS AND AS WE ARE IN THIS MOMENT. WE HAVE TO UTILIZE THIS MOMENT TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE WILL BUILD AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT IS BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE HAD BEFORE. IT HAS SPOTLIGHTED MANY INEQUITIES STARTING IN THE PANDEMIC AT THE BEGINNING OF IT. WHEN WE SAW THAT A MILLION STUDENTS DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO COMPUTING DEVICES AND ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. THIS LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR STEPPED IN AND MADE SURE THAT IMMEDIATELY THERE'D BE RESOURCES TO SUPPORT. THOSE STUDENTS TO BEGIN THE WORK TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE- THIS LEGISLATURE AND THIS GOVERNOR OFFICE OF ALL WORK TOGETHER ON THINGS TO ADDRESS. COLD MEDICATIONS DIRECTLY WITH COVERT TESTING ENOUGH VACCINES. BUT YET IN SPITE OF ALL OF THIS WE SEE THAT- THE PANDEMIC CONTINUES TO EVOLVE. EVEN AS WE SPEAK TODAY HEALTH EXPERTS ARE TALKING ABOUT A NEW CHALLENGE. A NEW VARIANT THAT REPRESENTS A NEW THREAT TO US TO OUR WAY OF LIFE NOT JUST TO OUR SCHOOLS BUT TO OUR ENTIRE WAY OF LIFE OUR ENTIRE WAY OF SURVIVAL. ARE SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT WE KNOW THAT OUR KIDS DESERVE IN MUST STILL GET AN EDUCATION. AND SO WHILE WE CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THE CHALLENGES THAT WE SEE IN OUR SCHOOLS WE KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO. TO BUILD SCHOOLS BETTER THAN WHAT THEY WERE BEFORE IN THIS LEGISLATURE AND THIS GOVERNOR WE'RE PROUD TO BE IMPLEMENTING MANY OF THOSE GREAT PROGRAMS. HAVE PROVIDED INCREDIBLE PROGRAMS FOR DOING THAT AND IT'LL BE IMPORTANT. WE TALK ABOUT UNIVERSAL T. K. IT WILL BE IMPORTANT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE BIG. ENROLLMENT TRENDS THEY TEN TO BE GREATEST. IN THE LOWER GRADES INDICATE THREE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. BUT HAVING UNIVERSAL TKA REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT FOR PROBABLY MOST OF OUR PROFESSIONAL CAREERS. AND THANK YOU SOME IN THE MCCARTY FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. OVER MANY MANY YEARS- AND FOR THIS LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR FOR MAKING THIS SOMETHING THAT IS A HALLMARK. IN OUR STATE BUDGET THAT WE WILL HAVE PROGRAMS READY FOR YOUR LAWN STATE. AND SO YES WHEN YOU TALK TO MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THEY WILL TELL YOU THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE FEELING AROUND THE CLIMBING IN ROME. THEY WILL TELL YOU THE CHALLENGES THEY FEEL AROUND- CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM AND STUDENTS WHO. HAVE NOT CHECKED IN AND WHO ARE NOT ATTENDING. EVERY PUBLIC SCHOOL TRADITIONAL. PUBLIC AND CHARTER PUBLIC WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY ARE EXPERIENCING. ISSUES AROUND ATTENDANCE AND THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THEIR CURRENT OPERATING. ABILITIES THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE FUTURE TO BORROW THE TERM. THAT YOU ALL HAVE USED IN THIS AGENDA THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS. FOR THE FISCAL CLIFF GOING FORWARD THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT- AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE HELP FROM STATE LEADERSHIP. NOT JUST TO ASK FOR FUNDING BUT THOUGHT PARTNERS TO THINK THROUGH HOW TO APPROACH THAT CLIFF. AND HOW TO THINK ABOUT INNOVATION AND HOW TO. THINK ABOUT ENGAGING FAMILIES IN THE STATE OUR SCHOOLS THAT ARE DEALING WITH THE CLIENT ENROLLMENT EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM. HAVE ACCELERATED THEIR EFFORTS AROUND NOT REACH TO SPEAK TO FAMILIES TO DO FAMILY ENGAGEMENT OUR OWN OFFICE WE CREATED OUR FIRST FAMILY ENGAGEMENT DIVISION. DURING THE PANDEMIC SO THAT WE CAN HELP SCHOOLS THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT HOW TO ENGAGE WITH FAMILIES. EVERY SINGLE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS THINKING HOW DO WE DO MORE OUTREACH HOW DO WE- HELP TO SEND A MESSAGE ABOUT WHAT WE HAVE TO OFFER. HOW DO WE- TALK ABOUT WHAT WE WILL DO TO ADDRESS LEARNING LOSS IN THE GAPS THAT EXIST. AND THIS YEAR'S THE BY PROVIDES OF THOSE INCREDIBLE RESOURCES THAT YOU KNOW. UNIVERSAL AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMMING SO THAT WE HAVE WAYS TO SUPPORT STUDENTS FROM THE TIME. FROM BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS TO THE AFTER SCHOOL TIME THAT WE CAN SUPPORT LEARNING ACCELERATION THAT WE HAVE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO SUPPORT PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. TO SUPPORT OUR EDUCATORS WHO ARE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH OUR STUDENTS THAT WE HAVE ACCESS TO UNIVERSAL MEALS SO THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. CAN GET A MEAL REGARDLESS OF THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION OR THEIR BACKGROUND IT'S NOT ABOUT PAPERWORK WE HAVE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THAT. SPEAKS TO THE CONCERNS ADDRESSED BY THE MAJORITY LEADER AT THAT OUR STUDENTS NEED TO HAVE ACCESS TO SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORTS AND WITH THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS INITIATIVE. OUR STUDENTS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE PROGRAMS I CAN PROVIDE. MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL HEALTH- SOCIAL SERVICES BUT MORE THAN THAT TRANSFORMATIVE SERVICES THAT WILL CHANGE WHAT ARE SCHOOL CLIMB IT LOOKS LIKE. THE CLIMATE OF OUR CAMPUSES IN THE SOFTENING OF OUR CAMPUSES IN THE ENDING OF THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE. AND CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE TRAJECTORY OF ALL OF OUR STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR BACKGROUND. AND SO WE HAVE THESE DIFFICULT CHALLENGES BUT WE ALSO HAVE. FOR MANY OF RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE IN UNIVERSAL. MEALS AND UNIVERSAL PRE K. AND- AND OF COURSE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS WILL BE TALKING ABOUT ALL THESE THINGS- AS WE TRY TO SUPPORT OUR SCHOOLS AS THEY- IS THE BILL BACK THEY- ARE SCHOOL LEADERS WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT. THEY ARE WORKING ON THESE ISSUES THEY APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT THAT HAVE COME FROM THE STATE. AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT THEY ARE TRYING TO MANAGE A CLIFF. THAT INVOLVES CALCULATING HOW TO USE WHAT ARE ESSENTIALLY ONE TIME DOLLARS FROM THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHILE THEY TRY TO THINK THROUGH STRUCTURAL CHALLENGES THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO ANSWER FROM BEFORE. THE PANDEMIC IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA AROUND IT DECLINING ENROLLMENT YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE'S BEEN POPULATION DECLINE FROM BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. THAT FEWER BIRTHS- FOLKS HAVE RELOCATED FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND LEFT OUR STATE- AND SO THAT WE SEEN. A SLOW GROWTH IN POPULATION AND IN SOME CASES JUST AN ACTUAL DECLINE. THAT THE CLIENT CLEARLY HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC. AND OUR SCHOOLS ARE WORKING HARD TO REACH THOSE FAMILIES WHEREVER THEY ARE- TO DETERMINE HOW TO BRING THEM BACK. IN SO THE MESSAGE THAT I'VE HEARD FROM OUR SCHOOL LEADERS IS THAT THEY WANT PARTNERSHIP AS ALWAYS WITH OUR STATE LEADERS. ON HOW TO THINK ABOUT THAT CLIFF ON HOW TO THINK ABOUT INNOVATION ON HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS CAN HAVE ACCESS. TO WORLD CLASS PROGRAMS THAT TEACH THEM A SECOND LANGUAGE BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT DUAL LANGUAGE PROGRAMS. ARE THE WAY TO ACCELERATE BRAIN DEVELOPMENT THAT SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS AND MAKE THEM GLOBAL CITIZENS OF THE WORLD ON STEAM EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES. TO PREPARE OUR STUDENTS FOR THE JOBS OF TOMORROW- FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR STUDENTS TO LEARN ABOUT CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND MAYBE EVEN GET A PAID INTERNSHIP. OUR SCHOOL LEADERS AR WARNING TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON HOW TO BRING FORWARD. THESE KINDS OF INNOVATIONS THAT SHOW THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A DIFFICULT MOMENT THIS IS THE MOMENT FOR US TO BUILD AN EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT'S BETTER THAN WHAT WE'VE HAD BEFORE. TO SERVE OUR SIX MILLION STUDENTS AND WE HOPE TO ALLOW THE WAY YOU'LL- OUR- AND WE DECLARE. THAT WE'RE GOING TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS LEARN TO READ BY THIRD GRADE. THAT WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON BY LITERACY GOALS THAT OUR STUDENTS LEARN TO READ AND WRITE MORE THAN ONE LANGUAGE. AND THAT WE LEARNING GAP ESPECIALLY THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE SEEN. AS IT RELATES TO BLACK STUDENT PERFORMANCE COMPARED TO THAT OF OTHER GROUPS AND THAT WE'VE NAMED A BLACK STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT TASK FORCE TO HELP OUR STUDENTS. MANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN A PART OF IT THANK YOU SO MEMBER BOSTON OTHERS WHO JOIN OUR EFFORTS. AROUND LITERACY AND OUR GOAL TO PROVIDE A MILLION BOOKS TO STUDENTS AND FAMILIES IN NEED WHO WHO NEED IT. AND TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO LIBRARY CARDS AND ACCESS TO LIBRARY SPACES IN JUST THE NEXT. SEVERAL MONTHS WE ANTICIPATE A HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE STUDENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE WILL GET ACCESS. TO A LIBRARY CARD AND SO WE SAY THIS TO SAY THAT WHILE WE EXPERIENCE THIS DECLINING ENROLLMENT WE ALSO SEE OPPORTUNITIES. TO BUILD FROM THESE CHALLENGES TO MOVE TOWARDS INNOVATION. IN OUR SCHOOLS HAD TO USE THE WONDERFUL TOOLS PROVIDED BY ALL OF YOU TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSAL T. K. AND UNIVERSAL MEALS- TO PROVIDE. A GREATER OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR STUDENTS AND- THEY ARE PREPARED TO SHARE ANY DATA THAT ANY IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT ANY OF THE DECLINES IN YOUR SPECIFIC DISTRICTS. WE DO HAVE THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TODAY- ARE DISTRICTS STAND BY TO WORK CLOSELY WITH YOU WE'VE EVEN ENGAGE SOME OF OUR DISTRICTS ON HOW THEY CAN MARKET DIFFERENTLY. TO OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITIES THEY WANT SCHOOL COMMUNITIES TO KNOW ALL THE GREAT OFFERINGS THAT THEY HAVE IN ALL OF THESE NEW PROGRAMS AND SO- WE STAND BY TODAY FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS IN YOUR SUGGESTIONS ON HOW WE CONTINUE THIS WORK THAT HAS BEGUN. TO ADDRESS AN OFFSET ISSUES AROUND THE CLIMBING ENROLLMENT. AND TO SHOW THAT ONCE AGAIN WE ARE ABLE TO BUILD AN EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM. THAT IS BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAD BEFORE. ON BEHALF OF. ALL OF OUR SIX POINT TWO MILLION STUDENTS. THANK YOU AND I SUBMITS ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MISTER. THANK YOU SUPERINTENDENT THAT I WANT TO JUST FOCUS BRIEFLY. ON THE BUDGET. PIECES IN THE FINANCES SO. OF COURSE WORK. HERE TO WITH THE- CA. AND IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE PANDEMIC IT'S REALLY ABOUT ITS IMPACT ON STUDENTS GETTING BACK IN SCHOOL AND PARENTS GETTING BACK TO WORK AND HAVING A FUNCTIONING ECONOMY WHICH- SCHOOLS ARE OPERATING AND HOW WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE- FOCUS ON STUDENTS WHO WERE FRANKLY BEHIND BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND YOU KNOW BUILD BACK. BETTER FOR IT FOR EVERYBODY. THE ISSUE THAT I THINK I'M HEARING MAYBE YOU CAN ENLIGHTEN US. IS THAT IT FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICTSJUST ON THE MONEY PIECE IT'S A DISCONNECT. BECAUSE WE SEE. THESE REPORTS AS FAR AS RECORD REVENUE COMING IN TO CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW AS WE KNOW THE WEALTHY ARE DOING VERY WELL. IN OUR STATE SPACE IS THE BEST LEAD AFTER THE PANDEMIC STARTED. RECORD AMOUNT OF MONEY COMING IN THE CAPITAL GAINS ONE TIME SO YOU LOOK AT THAT ONE TIME MONEY. WITH THE STATE MONEY LAST THE FEDERAL WE'RE TALKING FORTY BILLION DOLLARS WHICH YOU'RE RIGHT DISTRICTS CAN'T USE THAT FOR ON GOING AND THEY SAY THAT- WE CAN'T IS AN ON GOING BUT STILL WE HAVE WE HAVE NORTH OF TWENTY BILLION AND ONGOING JUST PUT IN PERSPECTIVE THREE YEARS AGO MR. ON THE TWENTY TWENTY TO BALLOT TO INCREASE TAXES ON THE HIGHEST EARNERS TO GET CALIFORNIA IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACK FOR PEOPLE FUNDING WELL THE LAST TWO YEARS THAT'S HAPPENED I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT THIS NEW AND IT'S HARDER BECAUSE TO PROJECT IN THAT TAKES AWHILE TO SEE IT BUT APPLES TO APPLES BUT- CALIFORNIA WE'RE NOW IN THE MIDDLE THE PACK SO. HOW DO YOU HOW DO YOU FOCUS ON THIS DISCONNECT THAT SOME DISTRICTS ARE LIKE THE SKY IS FALLING THROUGH IS THAT THERE IS THIS THE CLIFF AND WE'RE GOING TO GO OFF THE CLIFF IS I WANT TO MONEY WHEN WE HAVE. TWENTY BILLION A GENERATIONAL CHANGE AS FAR AS INVESTING IN OUR SCHOOLS WHAT WILL BE BUT THE VOTERS WERE PROMISED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHEN I WAS IN SCHOOL HERE AND SALAS TV COMMERCIALS FOR THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE PUBLIC SCHOOL FUNDING NOW WE'RE KIND OF THERE AND SO WE'RE HEARING THESE TWO THINGS AND SO HAVE YOU GO TO SCHOOLS LIKE I DID. I WAS AT A SCHOOL YESTERDAY IN OUR AND OUR SUPERINTENDENT SAID YOU KNOW WE HAVE SOME DECLINING ENROLLMENT HERE FOR JUST POPULATION DECLINES IN AS WE SING ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA NOT STABILIZATION IN SOME OF THESE NEIGHBORHOODS HE SAID 95% OF THE PARENTS ARE HAVE GONE BACK ABOUT. 5% ARE DOING INDEPENDENT STUDY BUT ARE STILL IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM SO THEY'RE NOT. SO HOW DO WE RECONCILE THESE TWO THINGS TONS OF NEW MONEY IN SOME DISTRICTS LIKE FREAKING OUT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST SAY I WOULD ASK YOU TO THINK ABOUT YOUR QUESTION IN THE CONTEXT OF TO SPECIFIC AREAS- STAFFING AND STAFFING SHORTAGES- AND IF WE JUST USE UNIVERSAL MEALS AS AN EXAMPLE- UNIVERSAL MEALS IS AN INCREDIBLE THING IS AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY. BUT RIGHT NOW THIS STATE JUST LIKE ALL OF THIS NATION IS EXPERIENCING A SHORTAGE IN SUPPLY IN ORDER FOR SCHOOLS TO IMPLEMENT UNIVERSAL MEALS THEIR COSTS ARE READY. UP ARE GOING UP AND WILL GO UP HIGHER IN SO THERE ARE COST CONSIDERATIONS MATTER FACT I WAS THINKING THE LAST TIME I SAT IN IT EDUCATION COMMITTEE HEARING PHYSICALLY IN THIS BUILDING WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT YOU IN TERMINAL DAHLE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. THAT OUR SCHOOLS WERE ALREADY FACING- LACK OF REVENUE NECESSARY TO OPERATE- TO PAY STAFF TO PROVIDE THE OPERATIONS FOR OUR CORE OPERATIONS IN OUR SCHOOLS AND SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED THE PANDEMIC HAS EXACERBATED ALL OF THAT. IN OUR SCHOOLS ARE APPRECIATIVE OF THE SUPPORT THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED IN THIS ONGOING ADA- BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC'S NOT OVER- SCHOOLS ARE SAYING HEY WE'RE APPROACHING THE CLIFF AND THEY'RE SAYING YOU KNOW HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO GET HELP GOING FORWARD BECAUSE THEY SEE THE CHALLENGES. OF YOU KNOW STUDENTS WHO WERE IN QUARANTINE STUDENTS WHOSE ATTENDANCE HAS BEEN- WHO HAD CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM YOU'LL HEAR FROM SOME DISTRICTS TODAY THAT WILL TALK ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES WE'RE EXCITED TO WORK CLOSELY WITH OAKLAND IN INGLEWOOD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICTS ON SOME PROGRAMS THAT WE THINK MIGHT HELP TO. COUNTER SOME OF THE DECLINING- OR THE CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM BUT- SCHOOLS ARE SAYING THAT OUR COSTS ARE HIGH THERE ARE SCHOOLS LIKE EVERY SECTOR IN THIS STATE IN THIS NATION ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING- IN AVAILABILITY OF STAFF TO HIRE TO HIRE NEW STAFF. AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SALARIES THAT SCHOOL STAFF GET PAID ON AVERAGE IT'S LOW AND WHEN SCHOOLS ARE LOOKING TO HIRE STAFF THEY EVEN SUBSTITUTES THEY'VE AT RATCHET UP. WHAT THEY PAY TO GET MORE STAFF AND EVEN THEN THEY CANNOT GET STAFF. BECAUSE OF A NATIONWIDE STAFFING SHORTAGE IN SO ONE TIME DOLLARS FOR PROGRAMS ARE HELPFUL TO SUPPORT PROGRAMMATIC NEEDS BUT DON'T BE QUITE. TO THE SAME NEED FOR ONGOING OPERATIONS THAT OUR SCHOOLS NEED TO HAVE YOU HERE THANK YOU FOR ME YOU'LL HEAR FROM DISTRICTS TODAY THAT YOU'VE ASSEMBLED TO GIVE YOUR TESTIMONY THEY'LL TELL YOU. THEY CANNOT HIGHER CLASSIFIED STAFF TEACHING STAFF SUBSTITUTES BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO OFFER WAGES THAT WILL OFFSET THE STAFFING SHORTAGE IN THIS STATE AND IN THIS NATION. AND ALSO INCREASE THE SALARIES OF THOSE THAT THEY CURRENTLY HAVE IN THERE IN THE CURRENT STAFFING ROLES AND SO I THINK THAT IF YOU JUST THINK OF THESE TWO EXAMPLES. THEY GIVEYOU A WAY TO THINK ABOUT WHY EVEN WITH THE INFLUX OF DOLLARS THAT ARE COMING- IT IS NOT. THE SAME AS HELPING THEIR OPERATIONAL NEEDS GOING FORWARD. OKAY THANK YOU. QUESTIONS MISTER O'DONNELL YEAH I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE PAYING APPROPRIATE PICTURE SCHOOLS ARE OPEN YES OKAY I'VE BEEN IN SCHOOLS. I GOT A DAUGHTER IN HIGH SCHOOL SHE GOES TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY. THE SCHOOL IS FULLY STAFFED YES SOMETIMES SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS ALL RIGHT CHALLENGE I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT I MEAN I. I HEARD OF ONE DISTURBING THESE PAY THERE'S PAYING A HUNDRED BUCKS A DAY THAT PROBABLY ENDS UP BEING LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE IF YOU DO A FULL DAY OF TEACHING RIGHT. WHICH IS CRAZY TO ME- NO WONDER GOTTA COMPENSATE PEOPLE ADEQUATELY. AND REMEMBER YOU'RE ALSO ASKING PEOPLE TO GO INTO A CLASSROOM WITH THE PROBABLY CULPRIT IN MANY CASES RIGHT. IT'S OUT THERE RIGHT SO YOU NEED TO BE WE NEED YOU KNOW ASKING THEM TO DO THAT AND AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO MY STATE WHERE IT'S ASIER FOR SACRAMENTO THEY OPEN THE SCHOOLS. IT'S MUCH HARDER TO DO IT AND YET THAT HAS BEEN DONE SO I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE PICTURE PAYING IS ADEQUATE SCHOOLS ARE OPEN KIDS GOING TO CLASS. HEY KIDS ARE THERE- WHAT DO WE HAVE SOME CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM YES WE DO. WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE THAT FURTHER AND SEE WHERE THEY WENT- SEE IF IT'S MORE INTERMITTENT. I DO THEY COME SOMETIME TODAY NOT COME THE TIMES BECAUSE A CO. IS BECAUSE OF FAMILY SO. WHICH IN SOME SOME SOME. SOME SOME SCHOOLS HAVE ALWAYS EXISTED. SO GUYS ONE MAKE SURE THAT THE PICTURE WE PAINT IT IS FAIR AND ADEQUATE. I'M VERY IMPRESSED WHEN I WALK INTO SCHOOL SITE SEE WHAT'S GOING ON. KIDS ARE THERE- ABSENT AMASSED QUITE FRANKLY THINGS LOOK PRETTY MUCH LIKE THEY DID BEFORE COAT- SIR THERE'S MORE PROTOCOLS IN PLACE. HANDWASHING ECCENTRIC- BUT AGAIN. YOU KNOW THE SCHOOLS ARE OPEN THEY'RE OPERATING. THANK YOU MISTER SUPERINTEND THANK YOU AYE I CONCUR WITH YOUR- ASSESSMENT- MISTER CHAIRMAN I'VE HAD THE CHANCE TO VISIT DOZENS OF SCHOOLS ON DAY ONE.

THEY'VE HAD TO LEARN HOW TO DO HEALTH RELATED- INTERVENTIONS ON THE FLY AND OFTEN DON'T HAVE NURSES OR- OTHER HEALTH STAFF. WHAT OUR SCHOOLS EDUCATORS STUDENTS AND FAMILIES ARE DOING.

CAPTAINS BLOCK GRANT DISTRICTS HAVE TO PICK USE FOR BECAUSE. ON THE NEXT PAGE ARE WE A TABLE THAT WALK THROUGH THE FUND I THINK. I WAS EARLIER. THERE WAS A- AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDING OF A- THROUGH THE VARIOUS READ. ALL PEOPLE JUST SHOWS THE LAW TWO FEDERAL FACT. REPORT AT. IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUT- FOR SCHOOL I WOULD BEEN CUT THE FIRST PIECE TO TWENTY BILLION. IN ONE TIME FOR- BACK BE USED FOR A VARIETY OF OUR- BUT THE INTENT TO ADDRESS EITHER COLD NINETEEN.

OKAY THANK YOU WE WILL TRY TO GET THE END. PANEL AND THEN TO. MEMBER QUESTIONS IN COMMENTS THE ENTIRE FOR PANEL AND THEN. HEAR FROM MEMBERS THE GO TO SET PANEL. SO NEXT WE- PARTICIPATE FROM ATTENDANCE WORKS. HETTY CHANG. HELLO I'M AND CAN I ASK THIS TO GIVE ME A HERE FUNCTION ON THE A SECOND CHANCE LOS. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE CAREQUALITY MCCARTY AND NATURAL DONALD- SO- I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND PROTECT WORKS WE WORK NATIONALLY BUT WE ARE BASED IN CALIFORNIA SO WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF COLLABORATING WITH THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT. NUMBER SCHOOL DISTRICTS HERE- I WANT TO GIVE JUST A QUICK OVERVIEW OF CHRONIC ABSENCE AND WHAT WE'RE STILL HAPPENING BOTH IN TERMS OF THE CHECK. WORKING CHALLENGED AND WHAT ARE THE KINDS OF STRATEGIES THAT CAN HELP TO ADDRESS IT JUST LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD REALLY QUICKLY WHEN I MEAN WHEN I SAY CHRONIC ABSENCE I MEAN MISSING. 10% OR MORE SCHOOL FOR ANY REASON THAT INCLUDES EXCUSE UNEXCUSED ABSENCES AND SUSPENSIONS. THAT'S SO WELL THAT EIGHTEEN GAVE OVER THE COURSE OF AN ENTIRE SCHOOL THAT'S TWO DAYS IN THE FIRST MONTH FOUR DAYS IN THE- SECOND SIX DAYS IN THE THIRD MONTH OF SCHOOL. DIFFERENT FROM JUST LOOKING AT TRANSLATE OR AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE BOTH OF WHICH CAN MASK HIGH LEVELS OF CHRONIC ABSENCE. LOOKING AT CHRONIC ABSENCE MATTERS BECAUSE CHRONIC ABSENCE IS A- PREDICTOR OF WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO READ AT GRADE LEVEL IN THE THIRD GRADE. WHAT HAVE EVEN ACHIEVEMENT IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. AND EVEN CONTINUAL. SECONDARY EDUCATION. HI CAPTAINS OF THE- AND- IT BECAUSE ANY. AND AT. YEAH EARLY YOU HEARD- I APPRECIATED THAT BOTH SUPER THERMAL AND- ASSEMBLY DONALD TALKED ABOUT THAT MOST OF OUR KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL AND THAT IS TRUE AND IF YOU BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATE AT THIS IS. A CHANGE CRISIS THANK. FROM THE CAPTAIN IN THE BEGINNING. OF A TWO NINETEEN TWENTY. WHAT ABSENCE WHICH IS K. THINGS PERCENT OF ALL BY THE UNITED AND TO ONE ONE AND THEN KIND OF GAP THE LEVELS OF KERR AFTER IN TWENTY ONE TO TWO. AND WHAT YOU ARE SEEING IS AND WHILE MISSING SO WHILE THE MEN OF KIDS ARE SHOWING UP TO SCHOOL AND LEARN TAUGHT. A YOU'RE SO OKAY. SIGNIFICANT GROWING NUMBER OF. WHO ARE TRYING UP. FROM A LAB THIRTY PERCENT. THIS FALL. THAT'S AN ENORMOUS INCREASE. AND LOOK AT IT BY GRADE LEVEL THE INCREASES ARE HAPPENING X. LORD MAYOR. IN KINDERGARTEN AND FIRST. ALSO VERY HIGH IN HIGH SCHOOL. WE ARE FACING AN ATTENDANCE CRISIS THAT EVERY GREAT. WITH SOME OF OUR TRANSITION GRADES MOST AFFECTED AFFECTING OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND WHILE IT WAS. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT MAKE IT WORSE LAST YEAR AND IT'S MUCH WORSE THIS CURRENT FALL. AND THIS IS DATA FROM SCHOOL INNOVATIONS AND ACHIEVEMENT THANK DRAW IT FROM THIRTY OF THEIR DISTRICTS WHICH HAVE ONGOING DATA THE STATE COLLECTED AT THE END OF THE YEAR TO STATEWIDE DATA I NOT YET AVAILABLE EVEN FOR LAST YEAR BUT THIS IS DATA ON OVER THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND KIDS IN CALIFORNIA. THE SURGE IN KOBE NINETEEN CASES IS DRAMATICALLY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF KIDS STUDENTS WHO ARE ABSENT WELL SOME OF THAT IS DUE TO FEARS AROUND HEALTH IT'S- QUARANTINE. ITS QUARANTINE TEN TO FOURTEEN DAYS THEY WERE TRYING TO IN PERSON SCHOOLING HAVE BEEN ENORMOUSLY CHALLENGING OF BOOKS BECAUSE KIDS ARE AT SCHOOL WHERE HE CAN REAL CHALLENGES AROUND SCHOOL CLIMATE AND MANY OLDER STUDENTS RESEARCHED TO BAN SCHOOL WITH GROWING FAMILY WORK RESPONSIBILITIES THESE CHRONIC ABSENCES IN THE FIRST MONTH OF SCHOOL ARE ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE LEARNING A SCAFFOLD ID WHEN YOU MISS OUT ON THIS MY SCHOOL THE BEGINNING OF THE- YEAR. IT MAKES IT HARD TO STAY IN SCHOOL FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SCHOOL YEAR BECAUSE YOU. IT'SHARD TO CATCH UP IT'S ALSO THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR WHEN YOU FOR INTERRELATIONSHIPS WITH MOVES AND WITH WITH YOUR PEERS AND WITH YOUR TEACHERS SO THAT YOU FEEL THOSE CONNECTIONS AND HAVE THE RESOURCE. FOR LOST LEARNING TIME IN THE CLASSROOM AND WE KNOW THAT CHRONIC ABSENCE IN THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR CAN CAN PREDICT CHRONIC ABSENCE. FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. IF IT'S NOT IN A ROW AND IT'S ALL. NOW WILL MEANS WE NOT BLAME ARE FOR BUT SHE WHAT. WHAT IS THE ABOUT- THE BERRY LIKE A HOUSING CHRONIC AND BUT YOU KNOW WE KNOW AND I'M CREATING BUT IT'S ALSO OF ACCESS TO CARE HEALTHCARE. WHAT IS IT ABOUT BURGEONING AND KIDS BEING PUSHED OUT WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE HAVE TO FULLY RE INVASION AND BUILD THAT CAR EDUCATION SYSTEM SO THAT EVEN IN VIRTUAL AND- IN IN PERSON IT'S MORE ENGAGING THAN EVER. AND HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE FACT THAT FAMILIES STILL MAY SUFFER SOME MISCONCEPTIONS BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHICH OF THESE REASONS ARE. HAPPENING SO WE CAN ACTUALLY COME UP WITH REAL SOLUTIONSFOR KIDS AND FAMILIES. WE KNOW THAT KIDS AND FAMILIES. STUDENTS GO TO SCHOOL WHEN THEY SEE POSITIVE CONDITIONS FOR LEARNING WHEN SCHOOL IS PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY HEALTHY AND SAFE. WHEN SCHOOL THE PLACE OF BELONGING CONNECTION SUPPORT WHEN THEY FEEL ACADEMIC CHALLENGING. AND THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY ADULTS AND PEERS WHEN YOU SEE A LARGE LEVELS OF CHRONIC ABSENCE. IT MEANS THAT WERE MISSING THESE CONDITIONS AND THAT ONE OF THE KEY THINGS THAT WERE HAVING TO PUT A BLAST. BACK IN PLACE HOW DO WE ENSURE THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. ESPECIALLY WHEN SO MANY KIDS HAVE BEEN OUT OF SCHOOL LAST YEAR AND ARE HAVING SPORADIC SCHOOL EXPENSES THIS YEAR. IT'S ABOUT PUTTING IN PLACE A TIERED SUPPORT SYSTEM. THAT WE USE DATA TO KIND OF IDENTIFY WHO NEEDS I DO SUPPORT. BUT WITH THIS HIGH LEVEL OF CHRONIC ABSENCE ABOUT IT'S ABOUT REPRIEVE REINVESTING IN OUR PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION. AND THE PLACES THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GAIN ATTENDANCE THIS YEAR ARE THOSE PLACES THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INVEST. IN THEIR PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION FOUNDATIONAL WHOLE SCHOOL SUPPORT. THAT I'VE BEEN. LOCKED IN. THE ARE AND- THE FOUNDATIONAL BUILDING BLOCKS ARE I THINK WE TO A HOT THIS AND SCHOOLS ACROSS HIS AGE ARE NEEDING TO TAKE A LOOK AT AND MAKES WE CAN KEEP KIDS ENGAGED AND CONNECTED. LAST ACT CHRONIC ABSENCE. CAN LEAD TO INCREASES IN THE DROP OUT RATE AND LOWER WRITTEN WRONG THAT WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO ENGAGE IN CHRONIC ABSENCE. ENSURING LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY DURING PORTANTINO IF WE WANT THIS YEAH ABSENTEEISM I DON'T EXPANSION NOW NOT NEXT YEAR. IF YEAR AND DURING THAT. PLEASE OUR DATA AGAIN A FIVE WHICH KILLED FIRST AFFECTED WITH SCHOOL GREAT AND WE HAVE TARGET OUR RESEARCH AND OUR IMPLEMENTING WE HAVE. THE QUESTION MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING THAT CONNECTION ENGAGEMENT NOT USING THE OPPORTUNITY OF OUR BUDGET SURPLUS TO SCALE INTO STOLEN EVIDENCE BASED STRATEGIES. AND WE NEED TO EXPAND THE ARRAY OF FOLKS INVOLVED YOUNG PEOPLE FAMILIES EXPANDED LEARNING PROVIDERS COMMUNITY PARTNERS PUBLIC AGENCIES SO THAT THEY CAN PARTNER WITH EDUCATORS COULD WE ARE HEARING LOOKED AND CLEAR ABOUT THE STAFF YEAH TO GET SPAM THE SET OF ALLIED WHO ARE THERE TO SUPPORT ARE CHRONICALLY ABSENT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND HAPPY TO ANSWER. QUESTIONS WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. OKAY THANK YOU WE WILL GO TO OUR NAY PRESENTER NOW COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATION EXCELLENCE. MORNING A CHAIR MCCARTY CHERO DONALD MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE EDUCATION COMMITTEE MY NAME'S NOT NOVEL I'M THE CURRENT MEDIA OF THE CCP. I THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TO SHARE SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE CURRENT L. A. PERCEPTIONS WITH REGARDS TO- ATTENDANCE AND- EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGES THEY ARE FACING. THE CHILDREN ARE REALLY APPRECIATE THE FOCUS ON OPPORTUNITIES AND I APPRECIATE THE STATE SUPERINTENDENTS FOCUS ON PARTNERSHIPS THAT'S WHAT OUR FOCUS OF THIS PRESENTATION WILL BE. AS A REMINDER THIS YOU SEE IS A STATEWIDE AGENCY STATUS TO BY THE CYST ALL ELEAZAR CHEATING THEIR GOALS SET FORTH IN THE LOCAL COUNT ABILITY- PLANS. AND IN PREPARATION FOR THIS HEARING BE PROVIDED ARE ELLIE AS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE US SURVEYS- BOTH WRITTEN AND IN PERSON TO MEETINGS AND CONVERSATIONS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CHALLENGES. AND PERSPECTIVES AND CURRENT ACCOUNTS ARE THEY ARE. MAKING IN ADDRESSING THOSE CHALLENGES- THE QUESTION WE WERE AT TO REALLY A WAS HOW DOES THE COMING IN ON THE CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM FACT EFFORTS TO ACCELERATE PROGRESS IN LEARNING AND I THINK IT'S NO SURPRISE WHEN WE SAY IT IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT- ELLIE AS HAVE EXPRESSED THAT NOT ONLY DOES IT DECLINING ENROLLMENT AND THE CHALLENGES ARE GREAT- WITH FUNDING BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THE CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM ISSUES THE ABILITY TO HAVE STUDENTS IN SCHOOL ON A REGULAR BASIS COMPOUND THEIR ABILITIES TO ADDRESS THE LITERACY ISSUES CHALLENGES THAT THEIR STUDENTS EIGHTEEN. SOME OF THE BEHAVIOR OF THE REGULATE AMPLIFIED. NEARLY PROGRAMS THAT BEING SAID MAYES THINGS ARE HAPPENING. ROSS THE STATE THAT WE FOUND THAT ARE BOTH- AT THE STATE LEGISLATIVE LEVEL TO THE ALLEY A LEVEL THERE'S AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF HARD WORK THAT'S BEING DONE BY OUR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES COUNTY OFFICES AND EDUCATIONAL LEADERS IN THE STATE AND I THINK IT WOULD BE REMISS IF WE DIDN'T JUST POTS AND TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIGHLIGHTING SOME OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES AND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. AND WHERE WE CAN LEARN FROM OTHERS ABOUT THE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE BEING MADE IN ADDRESSING SOME F THESE CHALLENGES. SO IT STATE LEGISLATIVE- PERSPECTIVE THERE ARE ONLY AS- COMMUNICATED FOUR MAIN THEMES THEY SAID YOU KNOW THEY THEY REALLY WOULD ALLOW. THINK ABOUT. PATIENT FOR THEM IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE CURRENT INITIATIVES AS THEY BECOME ESTABLISHED. AS YOU REFLECT BACK ON CURRENT OR PAST STATEWIDE INITIATIVES SUCH AS- THIS SCALING UP INTO OFFICE. WHEN WE PASS THAT BACK IN SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN WE ALLOCATED ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO THAT AS A RESULT OF THE SPECIAL EDUCATION TASK FORCE REPORT. IT TOOK ABOUT ONE AND A HALF TO TWO YEARS BEFORE THAT INITIATIVE REALLY. GAIN TRACTION AT THE L. A. LEVEL THAT WAS UNDER- DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OBVIOUSLY THE CURRENT CONDITIONS MAKE THOSE- CHALLENGES EVEN MORE OBVIOUS. BUT THEY WANTED GRAYSON PATIENTS WITH INITIATIVES BECOMING REALITY. THEY WANTED- THAT THE STATE LEGISLATURE I UNDERSTAND THE CURRENT. ISSUES ARE THAT THE CURRENT ISSUES. REQUIRED DEEP COLLABORATION PROBLEM SOLVING AMONGST STATE LEADERS AND EDUCATORS AND THAT TAKES. TIME AND COMMITMENT. THEY WANTED OUR STATE LEGISLATORS TO KNOW THAT SCHOOLS ARE OPEN THEY ARE THE TO CENTER OF DONALD'S POINT- WHEN THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO KEEP KIDS IN SCHOOL AND THEY'RE HAVING. SUCCESS IN A MYRIAD OF PLACES BUT THEY ARE CHALLENGED OBVIOUSLY- OBVIOUSLY THOSE CHALLENGES WILL BE TALKED ABOUT THROUGHOUT THE MORNING. AND THEN ALWAYS THINK ABOUT INITIATIVES FROM THE POINT OF EQUITY AND THE WAY THEY AFFECT SMALL AND RULED LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. SOMETIMES IT'S CHALLENGING AS THEY THINK ABOUT UNIVERSITY K&lt;c.cyan&gt; ACCESS.&lt;/c&gt; TO FACILITIES FOR PRE K. THE SCHOOLS EXPAND MY UP. DOES TO KEEP IN MIND. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT'S HAPPENING THE EDUCATION POLICY LEVEL ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO THINK ABOUT CAPACITY BUILDING AND BUILDING THE CAPACITY OF CAPACITY BUILDERS AND THE TIME TO IMPLEMENT AND SEE CURRENT RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS TAKE A FACT. THE FOCUS ON STAFF RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION US SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE THINKING ABOUT THAT I MEAN THOSE PARTNERSHIPS WITH THEIR INSTITUTES OF HIGHER ED I CAN THINK OF ONE EXAMPLE. FRESNO COUNTY OFFICE OF ED HAS AND IS PREPARING AN AFRICAN AMERICAN TEACHER PIPELINE THAT BEGINS IN KINDERGARTEN THAT'S INCREDIBLY INNOVATIVE- INCREDIBLY HEAVY LEFT AND INVOLVES A LOT OF PARTNERS BUT THEY'RE THINKING THAT FAR AHEAD. AND ALSO YOUR COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND EXPANDED LEARNING AND CHOP EARLY CHILDHOOD FUNDING INITIATIVES THOSE ARE PREDICATED ON WHOLE CHILD DESIGN PRINCIPLES AND THAT REQUIRES A RETHINKING FOR THEM WITH A FOCUS ON TEACHING AND LEARNING IN A DIFFERENT WAY. THAN THEY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST OF INVESTING IN SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING MENTAL HEALTH. ONE OF THE- HIGHLIGHTS WAS THE CAL HOPE PRODUCT PROJECT OUT OF- SACRAMENTO COUNTY OFFICE OF THAT. THAT INVOLVES ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY OFFICES AND AN APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR KELLY ACE. WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT. THE OF THE WAYS TO MITIGATE INSTRUCTIONAL BARRIERS FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WHEN IT COMES TO INTEGRATING SUPPORTS. FOR SOCIAL EMOTIONAL. AND MENTAL HEALTH. INTERVENTIONS YOU ALSO HAVE A FOCUS ON. FROM THE MERRY OUTOF ELEAZAR WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT DATA IN A DIFFERENT WAY. THEIR FOCUS ON THE LCF STUDENT GROUPS THAT ARE HAVING THE MOST DIFFICULTY ATTENDING SCHOOL E. I HEARD IT OUT FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER. YOUR HOMELESS AND FOSTER STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. STUDENTS OF COLOR SKIP UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE STUDENTS ARE KNOWING THAT THE TENSIONS THAT THEIR FAMILIES ARE FACING AND TRYING TO MITIGATE THOSE ISSUES ARE INCREDIBLE SUCCESSES. AND OBVIOUSLY AT THE L. E. A. LEVEL. AND THAT THE TEACHER AND LEARNING LEVEL. TEACHERS ARE HAPPY FEEL INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF PRESSURE. TO ACCELERATE PROGRESS AND I THINK THAT THE MESSAGE THAT WE'RE HEARING IS WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN. FOR USING THE INTENSIVE INTERVENTIONS AND SUPPORT STAFF THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO TUTOR OUR STUDENTS BEFORE. DURING LUNCH AND AFTER SCHOOL YOU HAVE- AND THE NUMBER OF THE--ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITH THE INSTITUTES OF HIGHER ED. IL TO STAPLE TEACHING FORCE USING THEIR STUDENT TEACHERS IN DIFFERENT WAYS. YOU HAVE A COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND MULTI AGE COMING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS SOCIAL MOTION. LEARNING AND MENTAL HEALTH. AND THEY ARE DE THINK ABOUT TO THE MITIGATE. KEEP THE STAFF THEY HAVE. AND READ AND RETAIN. OUR FUTURE STATE SO THAT THEY CAN FOR ON THE IN THE OF THEIR STUDENTS AS THEY GO FOR. SO WITH THAT BEING SAID I THINK THERE ARE JUST. FOUR RECOMMENDATIONS I WOULD THINK- AND PROVIDE THAT THE CCP WILL BE FOCUSED ON AS WE GO FORWARD. ONE IS HELPING ALLEY GATES THINK STRATEGICALLY ABOUT THE CURRENT INITIATIVES THAT ARE IN THE PIPELINE YOU HAVE SEVEN. STATEWIDE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING INITIATIVES THAT ARE HIGHLY FUNDED- REQUIRE INTENSIVE AMOUNT OF TIME TO THINK YOU KNOW LEARNING AROUND EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES AND INTERVENTIONS. OUR JOB IS TO HELP TRANSLATE THOSE FOR COUNTY OFFICES AND ELEAZAR THE WAY THAT'S MEANINGFUL. WE KEEP THE FOCUS ON LEARNING INSTRUCTION TEACHERS TO SUPPORT THEM. IN THE WAYS THAT TO YOU HOW TO USE. THE RESOURCES AND WE SUPPORT THE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT BY THINKING ABOUT HOW DO WE PROBLEM SOLVE AND HAVE SOLUTIONS. FOR THE USE OF ONE TIME FUNDS IN A WAY THAT ALLOWS THOSE INNOVATIVE PRACTICES THAT DEVELOP OTHERS ONE TIME FUNDS INTEL ON GOING FUNDING. IN A WAY THAT SUSTAINS THOSE INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THE WAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE GOVERNOR VISION. AND YES ARKAN TO FOCUS ON. ORDINANCE OF AND- WITH THE FOR ON THE ALTHEA STOOD GROUPS THAT ARE MOST IN NEED. AND MOST OFTEN ARE. HAVE STOMACH VARIOUS CHEATING. BOSS UP THERE AND- ALLOW FOR QUESTION SIR WE WILL COME BACK TO YOU NOW WE'LL HEAR FROM. AT KYLA JOHNSON SURE MEL FROM THE OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. SHARE DONALD J. R. MCCARTHY AN HONORABLE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE EDUCATION COMMITTEE MEMBER. MY NAME IS DR CARLA JOHNSON THE CROWDS TO. OPEN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE IN EDUCATION COMMITTEE WITH TRENT OF STUDENT ENROLLMENT ABSENTEEISM IN OUR DISTRICT. MICHAEL THIS MORNING IS THAT CLEARLY ILLUSTRATE THE COMPLEXITIES AND SUBSEQUENT EXPERIENCED BY MY DISTRICT IN MANY OTHER DISTRICTS ACROSS CALIFORNIA AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE CODE. NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. I DID UNIT DAY DOES PASSED BY AS WEALTHY HERE FULL OF DATA SUPPLY FACT DONE. MANY OF THE COMMENTS I WILL BE WITH YOU THIS MORE. OUR DISTRICT HAS LONG ACTED AS A SEARCH CAN BE SCHOOLS DISTRICT SINCE AROUND TWENTY FOUR. ENSURING ASKED HAVE CONSISTS ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY INSTRUCTION WELL FOCUSING ON THE WHOLE CHILD. THIS APPROACH HAS. SWELLED TO RESPOND TO THE COLE AND DINNER. IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY WHEN THE PHYSICAL DOORS ARE SCHOOL DISTRICT INDEFINITELY CLOSED WE PRIORITIZE OUR IMMEDIATE RESPONSE EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT EVERY STUDENT IN OUR DISTRICT ACCESS TO A LAPTOP. WHY FIVE AND TECH SUPPORT. WE PARTNERED WITH THE CITY COMMUNITY AND PHILANTHROPY TO LAUNCH OAKLAND AND DIVIDE IT AND INITIATIVE TO GET DEVICES AND INTERNET INTO THE HOMES THAT EVERY- USQ STUDENT AND NEAT. WE WENT FROM 12% 299% OF LOW INCOME STUDENTS QUIPPED WITH THEIR OWN LAPTOP. INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. WITHOUT THE EFFORT OF OUR WERE HAVE HAD AN OP TAX LEARNING YEAR- YOU SEE ALSO PROVIDED OVER FIFTEEN MILLION MEALS TO OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES DURING THE PANDEMIC BECOMING THE HUB OF FOOD SECURITY FOR THOUSANDS OF OPEN CHILDREN AND FAMILY. WE ALSO OPENED SEVERAL IN PERSON AND VIRTUAL LEARNING HELPS JUST SEARCH CARPETED STUDENT GROUPS ENHANCED ACADEMIC AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. WELL IT WAS HAS IN THE CAR ENROLLMENT THIS FROM TWO DECADES DUE TO A NUMBER OF LOCAL ACTORS. BLASTED NEARLY ELEVEN HUNDRED STUDENTS THIS CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR IS UNIQUE. AND SINCE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY WE HAVE DROPPED BY A TOTAL OF ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY NINE STUDENTS. ALARMINGLY NEARLY ELEVEN HUNDRED OF THOSE STUDENTS ARE IN GRADES TKA THROUGH THIRD GRADE. AND 91% OF OUR TOTAL ENROLLMENT LOSSES ACCOUNTED FOR BETWEEN ATK IN EIGHTH GRADE. A TOTAL OF ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN STUDENTS MEETING WE ARE WITNESSING A DISPROPORTIONATE. NUMBER OF EARLY LEARNERS. WELL I PROJECTIONS CONCERT AND WE LOST ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED MORE STUDENTS EXPECTED THIS IS A MAJOR LOSS FOR OUR INVOLVEMENT. CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM THIS YEAR HAS NEARLY DOUBLED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. AND THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY SCHOOL YEAR 71% OF OUR STUDENTS SATISFACTORY ATTENDANCE MEETING AT 210095% OF SCHEDULED SCHOOL DAYS FOR BETTER. AS OF THIS YEAR TO DATE ONLY 47% OF OUR STUDENTS NOT SATISFACTORY AND- DURING THAT SAME TWO YEAR PERIOD- CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM JUMPED FROM 17% TO NEARLY 30% MOREOVER CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM RATES FOR OUR TARGET GROUPS HAVE DOUBLED IN SOME CASES TRIPLED COMPARED TO OTHER PEER GROUPS ARE LATINO AFRICAN AMERICAN AND ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER SPECIFICALLY MAKE UP ABSENCES IN THE DISTRICT. WE KNOW THAT THE ROOT CAUSES OF CRIME ABOUT CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM ARE MANY AND COMPLEX AND THESE ISSUES WERE EXACERBATED AND CONTINUE TO DO SO DURING THE PANDEMIC. IN ADDITION TO THE EXTRAORDINARY WORK OF OUR SCHOOL SITE ATTENDANCE IN COORDINATION OF SERVICE TEAMS WE ALSO HAVE RECENTLY RELEASED A TWO MILLION PROPOSAL REQUESTS FOR PROPOSALS TO OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE THE EXPERTISE RELATIONAL NETWORKS AND CAPACITY TO LOCATE AND SUPPORT. OUTREACH AND RE ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS OF OUR STUDENTS. WE ARE NOT GETTING UP ON ANY CHILD WE PLAN TO DOUBLE DOWN ON PROVEN STRATEGIES PROGRAMS AND INCENTIVES TO IMPROVE ATTENDANCE- UST RE OPENED ITS DOORS TO INCREASE LEARNING LAST SPRING. WE WERE ALSO THE FIRST LARGE URBAN DISTRICTS TO BEGAN AND IT'S TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR. THE IMMEDIATELY PLANNED FOR BE EXPANDED LAUNCHED A SEARCH WARRANT ON TRUTH ECONOMY ARE INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAM EVEN WITH SOME CHALLENGES THAT THE TIMING AND LIMITATIONS EIGHTY ONE THIRTY. OVER ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD IN SG TEE ACADEMY MAKING. HIGHEST ENROLLED SCHOOL IN OUR DISTRICT. ATTENDANCE IS ULTIMATELY DETERMINED BY SUBMISSION OF COMPLETED COURSE WORK RESULTING IN INACCURATE EIGHTY EIGHT. THIS COMPLEXITY IS FURTHER COMPOUNDED FIRE DISTRICTS STUDENT VACCINE POLICY TAKING EFFECT ON JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TO. A POLICY REQUIRE ALL NON VACCINATED STUDENTS TO TRANSITION FROM ONE PERSON TO JOIN OUR TRUTH ONLINE PROGRAMMING. THIS IS THEN WILL CONTINUE TO BE ANOTHER CHALLENGES. CHALLENGE BUT WE OVERSAW. I ALSO SHARE THE INFO OF THIS ONCE IN A LIFETIME MOMENT WE ARE ALL EXPERIENCING WILL BE FELT FOR AN ENTIRE AREA CHASKA THE NEW REALITIES AT THIS POINT WHERE THERE ARE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSIDERATION TO ENSURE THE STRENGTH AND PROMISE OF CALIFORNIA'S K. TWELVE SYSTEM. MY FIRST SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS ARE TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL YEAR OF HOLD HARMLESS AS THE START OF A MULTI YEAR STOP READING APPROACH. TO INCREASE SPACE ALTHEA NINETEEN ALTERNATELY MOVED FROM EIGHTY EIGHT TO ENROLLMENT BASED FUNDING SYSTEM. THAT'S WHAT ENSURE FUNDING FOR OUTREACH ENGAGEMENT AND SUPPORT STUDENTS NEED TO ENROL AND REGULARLY ATTENDS SCHOOL. MY ARGUMENT INSTANCE BUT BASS MANY OTHER LARGE URBAN WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE LOCAL FLEXIBILITY FOR HOW WE COLLECT ABA WITH INDEPENDENT STUDY AND ULTIMATELY COLLECT REVENUE. YES I BELIEVE WE MUST BE FOCUSED ON BOTH MEDICATING OUR CURRENT CHALLENGES AND EXPLOITING THIS MOMENT DESTRUCTION TO REIMAGINE THE FUTURE OF SCHOOLING. WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A GROWING MARKET FOR K. TWELVE ONLINE LEARNING AND FOR MORE FLEXIBLE LEARNING MODELS THAT PROVIDE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR WITH MORE WORK BASED OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS APPRENTICESHIPS AND CAREER PATHWAYS THAT PREPARE THEM FOR THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. THIS IS A NATIONAL AREA AND TRUST HIGH SCHOOL REDESIGN AND CALIFORNIA CAN LEVERAGES MOMENT BY INCENTIVIZING REDESIGN NETWORKS AMONG SCHOOL DISTRICTS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. BACK IN LEAD THE SECTOR AND INNOVATION SUCH APPROACHES WILL HELP TO RE ENGAGE STUDENTS AND ULTIMATELY BOLSTER. IT IS. I RECKON BECAUSE A PROVISION THAT ON THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS MODEL AND PROVIDES INCENTIVES FOR DISTRICTS TO MAKE BAKER AND ARE UNDER UTILIZED. FACILITIES AVAILABLE TO ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDING ESSENTIAL SERVICES TO STUDENTS AND FAMILIES INCREASING DISTRICT REVENUE STRENGTHENING CROSSSECTOR COLLABORATION AND STREAMLINED AND INTEGRATED AND EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF SUPPORT AND SERVICES FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. IN CLOSING I WANT TO COMMEND OUR STATE FOR HISTORIC INVESTMENTS AND THE COMMUNITY SCHOOL STRATEGY MENTAL HEALTH AND UNIVERSAL PRE K. AND EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. ALL OF THESE ARE NEEDED MORE THAN EVER TO MAKE OUR STATE EDUCATION SYSTEM THE BEST IN THE COUNTRY TO SUPPORT OUR FUTURE CIVIC LEADERSHIP WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ECONOMIC EDGE AND QUALITY OF LIFE. YES THIS MOMENT TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS SHORT TERM AND FUNDAMENTAL LONG TERM CHANGES TO STRENGTHEN OUR SCHOOLS FOR ALL CHILDREN. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ALLOWING ME TO SHARE WITH YOU THIS MORNING IT'S BEEN A PRIVILEGE TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY SUPERINTENDENT- NOW. GO TO COMMITTEE MEMBERS IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR ANY OF THE FOUR. SPEAKERS ON THIS PANEL. THIS REF. THANK YOU- SUPERINTENDENT I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU THE FIRST QUESTION SINCE YOU'RE STILL UP ON OUR SCREEN. ONE OF THE LAST THINGS YOU YOU TALKED ABOUT- ON YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS ONE IS TO USE IN ROMANS TO THE ADA. HOW SPECIFICALLY DO WE GET TO THAT POINT HOW HOW CAN WITH THEM OW CAN WE USE IN ROMAN RATHER THAN A DA- HOW DO I MAKE THAT SWITCH. WHAT PART OF THE RECKONING. I THINK THAT THAT'S MORE OF A LONGER TERM CONVERSATION AND THAT'S NOT AN EASY I'M SYSTEM SWITCH TO MAKE- I DO THINK WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT TOLD ME THAT THIS CHANGE SHOWN SO ELOQUENTLY IN TERMS OF WHICH PARTICULAR DISTRICTS ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED. BY HOW WE FUND SCHOOLS TENDS TO BE OUR DISTRICTS TO SERVE OUR MOST VULNERABLE I'M I THINK BEING ABLE TO HAVE SOME SHORT TERM. AS STRATEGIES AROUND HOLD HARMLESS TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE TIME THAT THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE THAT. TRANSITION I WOULD BE MY RECOMMENDATION. THANK YOU ANOTHER YOU MEANT IS A SPECIAL PROVISION SO SCHOOLS CAN USE EMPTY BUILDINGS. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT EMPTY BUILDINGS WITHIN THE SCHOOL THE SCHOOL DISTRICT- EMPTY BUILDINGS. OUTSIDE IN THE CITY THE COUNTY OWNED. WHAT BUILDING. WHAT ME- SCHOOL DISTRICT I'M JUST SEEN THE LEVEL OF DECLINING ENROLLMENTS- AND NOW WE DON'T REALLY IN OUR DISTRICT- HAVE BEEN UNDER UTILIZED FACILITIES I'M BRINGING INNOVATION IN TERMS OF HOW DISTRICTS CAN BRING IN ADDITIONAL REVENUE AND THINK ABOUT MANY AT THE SERVICES AN ORGANIZATION PARTICULARLY WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF MOVING TOWARDS A COMMUNITY SCHOOL MODEL I'M REALLY THINKING ABOUT FULLY ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO DO THAT IS CRITICAL AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT HAVING THE SERVICES OF MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES I WENT PREVENTION- AND THEN BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAST DISTRICTS SPACE- THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE BECAUSE OF DECLINING ENROLLMENT IT'S A WAY DISTRICTS CAN BE REVENUE. AND MAKING SURE THOSE SERVICES ARE CLOSER PROXIMITY TO THE SCHOOLS. TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. THANK YOU AND I DON'T KNOW IF THIS CAR WOULD BE YOU OR- ONE OF OTHER- PRESENTERS. THE IT THE ABA IMPLICATIONS- THE DROP IN EIGHTY EIGHT- IT IS ARE CAUSING STEP FINANCIAL PROBLEMS IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITHOUT A WITHOUT A QUESTION WHAT ARE THE SHORT TERM FINANCIAL- IMPLICATIONS AND LONG TERM IMPLICATIONS AND HOW CAN WE ADJUST. THE LCF OF FORMULA TO SOFTEN THAT IMPACT DO YOU HAVE SUGGESTIONS ON THAT. MAYBE MR CABRAL FROM THE L. A. U. DISTRAUGHT I CAN I CAN TAKE THAT AND I THINK WE WILL TALK ABOUT. WE'LL TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT MORE IN OUR NEXT PANEL AS WELL BUT IF YOU THINK I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THE WAY THAT THAT. WORKS WITH THERE ISN'T IS BUILT IN A ONE YEAR HOLD HARMLESS IN THE WAY THAT ATTENDANCE ALREADY- AND HAS LONG BEEN USED SO FOR THIS SPECIFIC FISCAL YEAR- BUT WE DIDN'T COLLECT THE PAYMENT DATA IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE COLLECT IT WE DIDN'T DO THE SORT OF TYPICAL EIGHTY COLLECTED BECAUSE STUDENTS WERE NOT. IN THE CLASSROOM SO FOR THIS YEAR DISTRICTS ARE RECEIVING EITHER AT THE HIGHER EITHER WHAT THEY'RE ATTENDANCES THIS YEAR IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO OR OTHER TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY ATTENDANCE SO THEY'RE PREPARED TO MAKE A TENANTS LEVEL SO. BECAUSE OF THAT THERE IS NO SPECIFIC SORT OF COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC RELATED IMMEDIATE IMPACT TO SCHOOLS SCHOOL DISTRICTS THIS YEAR NEXT YEAR THOUGH WHEN WE GET TO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE NOW THAT YOU'LL BE IN A SITUATION WHERE THE TWO YEARS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO OR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE ARE NOW AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC AND IF ATTENDANCE IS NOT RECOVER IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO THEN THAT'S WHEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS WOULD START TO SEE SOME OF THE MAJOR REDUCTIONS SO THAT'S NOT. THAT'S GOING TO BE A PART RIGHT NOW WE DON'T EXPECT THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE IMMEDIATE EFFECT ON ANY- ANY DISTRICTS SPECIFIC HEALTH EFFECTS FUNDING AMOUNT- FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS IT DOESN'T AFFECT BECAUSE CHARTER SCHOOLS DO NOT HAVE THE WHEN YOUR WHOLE TIME WITH. I DON'T BUT- THAT'S MORE OF A MOVING FORWARD THIS REGION IN TERMS OF HOW DO I DO DO THE SOFT LANDING A TO GET AS- I MENTIONED EARLIER WE ARE PROJECTING THAT THERE WOULD BE. SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN PROPERTY FUNDING THERE'S A VARIETY OF THINGS THAT YOU COULD DO WITHOUT PROPERTY FUNDING IF YOU WANTED TO- TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDING FOR PROJECTS ONE IS TO JUST PROVIDE LARGER BASE INCREASES WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY PER STUDENT IS LARGER AND THAT HELPS EVERYBODY KIND OF SEAT INCREASES THE FUNDING EVEN AFTER THEIR. ATTENDANCE IS DECLINING. THANK YOU. I WILL IF I MIGHT JUST ADD A LITTLE NAP CON THERE ONLY AT SIX STATES THE COUNTRY THAT USED AVERAGE ATTENDANCE FOR AS THE BAY FOR ALLAH STAY FUNDING RESOURCES SCHOOL- CALIFORNIA KENTUCKY TEXAS- BEAT THERE IS A FEW- AND THERE ARE A ARE AMONG THEM THERE HAVE BEEN A PRESIDENT ILLINOIS- ACTUALLY WHEN TONY SMITH WHAT'S THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT SHIFTED FROM AVERAGE THAT THE TENANTS FUNDING TO ENROLLMENT BASED FUNDING. ARE ENROLLMENT BASED FUNDING IS BASED ON COUNTS TAKEN A COUPLE TIMES A YEAR AT THE POSTED DAILY ATTENDANCE THERE ARE SOME PROS AND CONS FROM THESE TWO DIFFERENT APPROACHES I WOULD ACTUALLY SUGGEST THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WORTH LOOKING AT BUT IT REQUIRES SOME RESEARCH ON IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO LEARN FOR EXAMPLE FROM THE EXPERIENCE ABOUT KNOWING. ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. AS THEY SHIFTED THEIR APPROACHES. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU WE HAVE MISTER KILEY AND THEN SOME MEMBERS BONTA IN O'DONNELL KILEY. I THANK YOU I JUST A QUICK QUESTION FOR MR CABRAL I YOU MENTIONED THE SCHOOL REOPENING GRANTS THAT WERE PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE'S DELEO DONE ANY ANALYSIS OF HOW EFFECTIVE THOSE WERE IN- ENCOURAGING OR ENABLING- DISTRICTS TO. RE OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. NUMBER PROBLEM WOULD LOOK THAT'S PERFECTLY I KNOW THAT- WE HAVE NOT SEEN THE FINAL AMOUNT SO I THINK I THINK GIRLS I'M NOT SURE NAY DEPARTED THE DEPARTMENT BUT- WE WERE TOURISTS. BUILT AN AUTHORED BY MY THIRD JUST SOME TIME. ENSURE THAT SORT OF THE IT IF- IF THERE NEED TO BE SOME. GRANT MONEY RECORD. THAT THEY'VE THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TO ENSURE THAT THAT'S THE CASE WHY I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S HAPPENED WITH ME THAT WE. CAN CONTINUE. YEAH BE GREAT IF WE CAN GET THAT SORT OF AN- OF WHAT THE FUNDS ARE. SIR OUT THE PURPOSE OF GET STUDENTS BACK IN THE CLASSROOM QUICKLY. OKAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA AT ANECDOTALLY SHARE AS- A PERSON WHO IS THE SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER FOR ALAMEDA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND A NONPROFIT PROVIDER IN OAKLAND WHERE ARE AMAZING SUPERINTENDENT KYLA JOHNSON TRAMMELL OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT I WAS OPERATING IN THAT COUNTY OF ALAMEDA- TO MAKE COLLEAGUE AT MISTER KILEY A 100% OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THAT COUNTY. I ENDED UP RETURNING TO SCHOOL IN THE SPRING BECAUSE OF THAT BECAUSE OF THE ACT GRANTS THAT WERE PROVIDED THROUGH THE STATE TO BE ABLE TO AND IN INCENTIVIZE SCHOOLS TO BE ABLE TO DO SO- I JUST WANTED TO BE ABLE TO JUST HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE TESTIMONY THAT WE HEARD FROM OUR- FROM OUR PANEL HERE TODAY AND ONE IS JUST TO RECOGNIZE AT PARTICULARLY AT A SUPERINTENDENT KYLA JOHNSON FROM AL- THE FACT THAT OUR SCHOOLS DURING COVE IT BECAME A HUB FOR FOOD SECURITY. A HUB FOR DIGITAL CONNECTIVITY AND ESSENTIALLY THE PUBLIC HEALTH HUB CONTACT TRACING PROVIDING VACCINATIONS AND TESTING FOR WHOLE COMMUNITIES AT THE IMPACT OF THAT A FROM AN IMPLEMENTATION STANDPOINT ON ON OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS OR SCHOOL SYSTEMS ARE TEACHERS ARE EDUCATORS OUR STUDENTS AND OUR PROVIDERS THAT IS SOMETHING I THINK THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO UNDERSTAND FULLY FOR YEARS TO COME. I AM ALSO INCREDIBLY STRUCK BY THE DATA PLANE PROVIDED IN THE C. C. E. REPORT THAT SAYS THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC ARE EXPECTED TO LAST NINE YEARS WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THAT A. B. THAT A LOT OF THE ISSUES RELATED TO DECLINING ENROLLMENT HAVE TO DO WITH OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO MEET OUR STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE IN THE MOMENT THAT THEY'RE IN RIGHT NOW WHICH BRINGS US TO REALLY THAT FINANCIAL PROPOSITION. THAT WERE PRESENTED WITH WHEN WE HAVE WHEN WE HAVE THE ISSUE OF OUR STUDENTS. AND OUR COMMUNITIES RELIANT OUR OUR SCHOOL. TO BE ABLE TO PRO CARE. SERVICES AND MENTAL HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH PHYSICAL HEALTH. AT THE END ACADEMICS WHILE ALSO FACING DOWN THE IMPACTS OF A PANDEMIC FOR WHICH WE ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW. AT OVER OVERTIME AT AND ALL OF THAT WE'RE PUTTING INTO THE SPACE OF. OF HAVING STUDENTS THAT. WERE COMING TO OUR SCHOOLS WITH INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES THAT MANY OF OUR STUDENTS I KNOW FOR INSTANCE IN OAKLAND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. ARE WORKING FULL TIME JOBS AS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHILE THEY'RE ALSO TRYING TO DEAL WITH AND GETTING THEMSELVES EDUCATED. AND AT AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO COMMEND AS SUPERINTENDENT JAMELLE IN PART IN PARTICULAR. I FOR YOUR WORK MISTER CHANG FOR YOUR CONTINUED AT FOCUS ON THE IMPACT OF CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM OVER TIME AND REALLY ASK MY COLLEAGUES TO. TAKE TO HEED THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT HAVE PUT FOR BEEN PUT FOR PARTICULARLY AROUND AT RECONSIDERING THE WAY IN WHICH WE- ARE PROVIDE OUR FUNDING RESOURCES BY CONSIDERING A MOVEMENT FROM EIGHTY EIGHT. MODEL TO ENROLLMENT MODELS AND ALSO JUST RECOGNIZING THAT AS WE DO NEED TO THINK CONSIDERABLY ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL YEAR. OF HOLD HARMLESS FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I KNOW THAT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT IN ALAMEDA UNIFIED OAKLAND AND SAN LEANDRO IN MY DISTRICT ARE COUNTING EVERY SINGLE PENNY. I OF ONGOING FUNDS THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS WHEN THEY ARE EXPERIENCING THE MOST INCREDIBLE- THAT IT. IMPACTS OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE COMING TO SCHOOL READY AND ABLE TO LEARN ON AN ONGOING BASIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO MEMBER OF DONALD- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRS WANT TO COMMENT ON A QUESTION A- A SUMMER REYES PROUD OF AND THAT HAD TO DO WITH THE FUNDING AND I THINK THE RESPONSE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WAS THE CORRECT ONE- FROM MR CABRAL THAT IS BUILD MORE MONEY INTO THE BASE. EVEN MORE MONEY ON GOING MONEY COMES IN DON'T SENATE IN NEW PROGRAMS DON'T RECREATE THE CRAB ROLLS CATEGORICAL BUILD IT INTO THE BASS ALLOCATION UNDER THE LCF IS THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE IN THIS- THE SITUATION IS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE HAVING FEWER CHILDREN. HEY THERE ARE GOING TO BE IF YOU WERE STUDENTS GOING TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS SCHOOLS BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE HAVING FEWER CHILDREN. AND THAT'S A VERY LONG TERM- SITUATION WHICH NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. SO WITH THAT COMING BACK TO YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU- I JUST WANT TO KNOW TO THAT AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE SNACKS AND MR CABRAL TALKED ABOUT THE STUDENT THAT CLIFF IS- IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT- EIGHTY EIGHT ENROLLMENT. WE JUST HAD A PARTICIPANT EARLIER FROM ATTENDANCE WORKS TALK ABOUT CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM ONE THING. EARLY OUR KIDS RELATE TO SCHOOL BLAME IT ON THAT. ROUGH MORNING. YES WE ALWAYS DO. AND I GOT A LITTLE NOTE SAYING FROM OUR SCHOOL YOUR KIDS ARE TURKEY SO TECHNOLOGY AT ITS BEST RIGHT. AND SO IN SOME DISTRICTS OF KIDS DON'T SHOW UP IN A CALL THE PARENTS SHOULD FOCUS AND GET THE KID IN SCHOOL ONE. BECAUSE THEY MAY LOSE RESOURCES BUT TO THAT CAN IS TO BE IN SCHOOL TO HELP THAT COULD DO WELL IN LIFE. SO IF YOU JUST FOCUS ON ENROLLMENT WILL DISTRICTS GO AND HUSTLE TO GET STUDENTS BACKIN SCHOOL. I DON'T KNOW I WOULD THINK THAT THEY THEY SHOULD AND THEY WOULD NOW THAT'S THE MORALLY APPROPRIATE THING TO DO FOR IT FOR EDUCATORS AND I KNOW THAT MOST DISTRICTS YES THEY DO USE IN ROME AND SO. AS WE THINK WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT GOING FORWARD MAYBE THERE'S A MIDDLE GROUND THERE SOMETHING- BUT- YES- WILL CONTINUE NOW WITH OUR NEXT- PANEL WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON THIS AND ROMAN CLEF WHICH AS MR O'DONNELL THAT. NOTED WAS IS JUST ARE YOU KNOW OUR BIRTH RATES IN CALIFORNIA- AS WELL AS- YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE PANDEMIC WHICH IS KIND OF AN ACUTE ISSUE RIGHT NOW BUT I THINK WE SHOULD FOCUS ON THIS FROM THE LARGE PERSPECTIVE SO WITH THAT- NEXT PANEL YOU KNOW PLEASE DON'T- DISRUPT THE HEARING SO- THE SERGEANTS CAN MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE PARTICIPANTS- YOU KNOW STOP THE HECKLING IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM SO WITH THAT LET'S PROCEED NOW WITH OUR PANELISTS AGAIN LMAO- THICK MAT CINEMA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND SAN DIEGO UNIFIED. I HAVE. EVER WHAT LEAD SINGER OF ANALYST'S OFFICE GET MAKE IT HAD A THANK HAND OUT. A VERY SHORT THAT'S CALLED. BASED FUNDING SCHOOLS THAT JUST A TWO PAGER THAT WE USED TO HAVE TO WALK THROUGH ON THE BASICS OF ATTENDANCE AND TALK TO OUR- WE APART FROM OUTLOOK ASSUMPTIONS. JUST AS A POINT OF TO START OFF THE CONVERSATION. I'M SO FIRST ON PAGE ONE WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- ATTENDANCE BASED FUNDING AND HOW IT WORKS IN CALIFORNIA- I THINK A LOT OF THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED SO I'LL KEEP IT BRIEF- BUT THE PRIMARY FUNDING FORMULAS. FOR STATE FUNDING FORMULA FOR SCHOOLS RELY ON ATTENDANCE OUT OF THE WAY TO ALLOCATE FUNDING SO THAT INCLUDES- PRIMARILY WORK MOST IMPORTANTLY THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. BUT ALSO OUR SPECIAL EDUCATION FUNDING FORMULA AS WELL. ARAMBULA THE PER STUDENT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PER STUDENT GRANTS IN IN OUR PERSON BASED CRIMINAL DEFENSE IT'S REALLY. BASED ON THE YOU KNOW PER AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE OR ONE UNIT ABOUT AVERAGE. DAILY ATTENDANCE AND- ON A STATEWIDE. AND WITH THEM. BUT FIVE PER OF STUDENTS WHO. ARE THERE'S A LOT OF NAY 5% ATTENDANCE RATE SO DISTRICTS AS THE- USUALLY 95% OF THAT AMOUNT ABOUT INDEPENDENT STUDY I MEAN- IN THE LAST YEAR BE OF THAT THE ABOUT PER. FOR FAMILIES WHO DO NOT WANT TO BACK TO THE CLASSROOM- I THINK- WITH MENTOR HERE THE HEARING BY THE THAT ATTENDANCE CALCULATED IS BY- THAT. TAKING THE ASSIGNMENT AND WORK OUR WORK AT. FINE STUDENTS AND CA THAT TO A TIE VALUE WORKS OF EXAMPLE- THERE'S AN IDEA. STEP BY WORTH WEEK WITH AND I STUDENTS SUBMIT THAT. THAT'S HOW THEY RECEIVE ON SO THERE'S A VERY DIFFERENT APPROACH BUT CONVERTED TO USE OF SOME OF EIGHTY EIGHT. I'M SO THAT THAT'S SCHOOL DISTRICTS I'M USUALLY GOES THROUGH. THE SPRINGTIME TYPICALLY IT'S LIKE APRIL FIFTEEN THIRTY ONE WHEN DISTRICTS STOP COLLECTING ITEMS FOR FUNDING PURPOSES AND THAT'S USED. TO DETERMINE YOUR ALLOCATION AMOUNTS. THE IS A ONE YEAR HOW MUCH OF I'M SURE YOU'RE PER SCHOOL. NOT FOR BECAUSE THE SCHOOL THIS IN THE WHOLE HARMLESS. I'M ESSENTIALLY A ONE YOU'RE OFFER IN CASE. I'M PARTY FUNDING OF THE- GIVES. AND ONE YEAR. TO PREPARE FOR THAT ARE. THEY THEY KNOW WHAT TENANTS. AND THEY CAN THEY CAN- START TO BUILD IN THERE BUT IT'S A PLAN FOR HOW THEY'RE GONNA TRUST THOSE REDUCTIONS IN FUNDING. DURING THE PANDEMIC THERE WERE SOME OF. TO ATTENDANCE. SO IN NINETEEN TWENTY. THAT THERE IS EMERGENCY LEGISLATION THAT WAS PASSED IN MARCH TO- TO ADDRESS WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE PANDEMIC. AND SO FOR THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. ATTENDANCE WAS COLLECTED FOR TWENTY PURPOSE ONLY THROUGH THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY. SO ANY NINETEEN TWENTY. EIGHTY MEMBERS ARE JUST USING THAT UP TO. THAT POINT- THERE WERE A FEW DAYS. AFTER IN IN THE MONTH OF MARCH WHEN STUDENTS WERE. NEVER STOP CLASSROOMS WERE OPEN I THINK THERE ARE TWO STUDENTS WERE. STAYING HOME SO THAT THAT DATA IS NOT CORPORATE SO TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY DATA- YEAH ONLY GOES THROUGH FEBRUARY. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THERE WAS NO TRADITIONAL EIGHTY EIGHT COLLECTED- BUT THERE WAS NO SPECIFIC REQUIREMENT THE INSTRUCTIONAL- TIME REQUIREMENTS WERE DIFFERENT DIED TWENTY ONE SO IT WAS NO. WE'RE NOT SORT OF COMPARABLE DATA FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. FOR FUNDING PURPOSES DISTRICTS ARE FUNDED BASED ON THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY A MONTH SO- SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT AND BEYOND FUNDING WE USE JUST TO TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY MONTHS TO DIRECT. OUR IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO OF THIS LAST PROJECT FIFTY DIFFERENT YOU RETURN BACK TO ITS PREVIOUS POLICY. OF USING- ARE YOUR CURRENT YOUR OF FUN TO DETER- YOU'RE A EIGHT- BECAUSE AGAIN THERE WAS NO CHEMICAL. INTO TWO ONE IT'S REALLY YOU'RE LOOKING AT TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY DATA FOR TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO DATA WHICHEVER IS HIGHER SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT DISTRICTS ARE BEING DECLINED PENDANTS THIS YEAR THAN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY IT'S GOING TO BE THE EIGHTY THAT'S USED TO DETERMINE FUNDING. ON THE SECOND PAGE WE HAVE- A CHART PICKED HAS OUR OUTLOOK ATTENDANCE PROJECTIONS AND I THINK WE USE THESE LOOK MAINLY AT THE STARTING POINT. FOR FURTHER CONVERSATION SO THAT. YOU HAVE A- YOU CAN VIEW OUR BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS ARE AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE MAJOR UNCERTAINTY AROUND THESE ARE RUN THESE AND WHAT KIND OF ISSUES WE'RE LOOKING AT MOVING FORWARD IT'S WORK. HI TRACKING WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE TENDONS. UNDER THREE MAJOR DRIVERS OF ABOUT- THE CHANGES IN ATTENDANCE IN OUR IN OUR OUTLOOK AND THOUGHT. IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO JUST WALK THROUGH ALL THE TALK ABOUT HOW THOSE AFFECT ATTENDANCE OVER THE LONG RUN. THE FIRST ADAM AS IT I THINK I'M- MISTER DONUT MENTIONED YEAH IT IS THE- DEMOGRAPHIC DECLINES IN THE SCHOOL AGE POPULATION THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. EXIST A PART OF. THE PANDEMIC THAT. YOU'RE IN AND IS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY BY A LOWER BIRTH THE CALIFORNIA I BELIEVE WE HAD- YOU KNOW DECLINES IN BIRTH. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN CALIFORNIA SO WE'VE SEEN A LONG STANDING TO CLIMB. IN IN A MOMENT SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF THAT. AND SO UNDER OUR OUR FORECAST WE- WE CONTINUE TO ASSUME THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A DECLINE IN THE SCHOOL AGE POPULATION. AND I WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION BY. TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX OF A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. THE FACT. COMPLY THAT IS MORE UNCERTAIN PEACE AND I THINK A BIG PART OF WHAT- EVERYONE IS TRYING TO. ON WHAT WHAT WHEN MEANS IN THE LONG RUN IS THE IF I. OF THE PANDEMIC ATTENDANCE- WHAT WE CALL ON PAN RELATED. IN THE- WE DO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW FOR TWENTY TWENTY WE DID NOT COLLECT EIGHTY EIGHT WE DON'T HAVE A- TWENTY TWENTY ONE A- DATA. WE ALSO- I KNOW THAT THE TIME TO WORK THINGS WERE. SOME FROM. THERE IS NO STATE. A DATA YET BUT THERE WILL BE SOME PRELIMINARY DATA. RIGHT RIGHT THE DEPARTMENT USUALLY MAKES PUBLIC. IN LATE FEBRUARY. EARLY MARCH. THAT WILL GIVE US A SENSE OF STATEWIDE- EIGHTY EIGHT BUT WE DON'T HAVE THAT YET WE ALSO DON'T HAVE- STATEWIDE ENROLLMENT OF PUBLICLY AVAILABLE- DISTRICT HAVE COLLECTED IT BECAUSE OCTOBER WITH THE FROM TO STATE- BUT THAT'S NOT BEEN. CLEANED UP BY THE DEPARTMENT AND IT MADE PUBLICSO WITHOUT THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC TWENTY ONE THIRTY TWO- INFORMATION. TO GET AND WE DIDN'T HAVE TWENTY TWENTY ONE EIGHTY EIGHTY THE ONLY THING WE HAVE IS. FROM THE PANDEMIC STATEWIDE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE IN MOMENT SO. LOOKING AT THE DATA WE DIDN'T SEE A TWO AND A HALF PERCENT DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT- WHICH IS MUCH BIGGER THAN. DEMOGRAPHICALLY DRIVEN DECLINES OF RECENT YEARS TYPICALLY HAVE BEEN MORE LIKE. YOU KNOW I TENTH OF A PERCENTAGE POINT DECLINE- SO. WHAT WE HAVE ASSUME THAT THAT IS A CRITICAL THE NINETEEN RELATED DECLINE AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT. THE IN HOME AND THE CLIENTS THEY ARE IN. ABOUT 40% OF THE DECLINE IN THE MOMENT. COMES FROM T. K. AND KINDERGARTEN. AND AGAIN THESE ARE STATEWIDE NUMBER SO IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT REFLECTING SORT OF STUDENTS. MOVING FROM ONE DISTRICT TO ANOTHER BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT WAS A SHOPPING DISTRICTS- ENROLLMENT AND NOT IN OTHERS. THE REFLECT THE OVERALL JUST FEWER STUDENTS IN THAT SYSTEM NOW. WE'VE ALSO LOOKED AT OTHER DATA LIKE- PRIVATE SCHOOL AND HOMESCHOOL ENROLLMENT- AND PUT. THE LITTLE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE ON MIGRATION- IN AND OUT OF THE STATE. NONE OF THOSE THINGS SUGGEST THAT EITHER OUR STUDENTS ARE FEELING THE PUBLIC SYSTEM. OR THEY ARE MORE OUT OF STATE. SO ARE SOME SENIORS THAT DOES. ARE PARENTS WHO DECIDE THAT THEY DON'T. TO PUT THEIR KIDS IN. A CAN OCCUR. WHEN THEY WERE GOING TO BE A PRIMARY- IN REMOTE. ON WE KNOW. THE OCTOBER MOMENT THERE THAT WE HAVE IS JUST. POINT TIME- DURING SOME THIS. COURT YOU MILITARY. YOU SEE HOW WHAT A MOMENT LOOKS BY THE END OF THE YEAR THAT THERE THAT WOULD. HEALTHCARE SO WE'RE NOT SURE HOW MUCH LISTED IN. CAME FOR ABOUT WHEN SOME SCHOOLS OPEN THE SPRING BUT THAT'S THE DAY THAT WE HAVE TO OUR ASSUMPTION THERE IS. THAT THOSE STUDENTS WHAT. ABOUT THE EVENTUALLY COME BACK OVER MULTIPLE YEARS HE WAS SORT OF THE ATTENDANCE. RECOVER AS THOSE STUDENTS COME BACK THERE IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION ABOUT HOW BOSTON'S COMEBACK AND WHAT. WHERE THEY ARE ARE THE STUDENTS WHO DIDN'T GO TO KINDERGARTEN. AND FIRST GRADE WHICH THAT MIGHT LEAD THEM SIGNIFICANTLY BEHIND OR THE COMING IN OF KINDERGARTNERS JUST. SORT OF UP. TO FIFTY ZERO. BUT OVER TIME OUR OUR ASSUMPTIONS HERE ARE THAT THOSE. THAT BUT THOSE SORT OF. LONG TERM DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS DO CONTINUE AND THAT'S WHAT DRIVES- EIGHTY EIGHT- BUT THE LAST PIECE HERE IS- IS. THAT WHICH IN OUR CHART HOUSE LIKE GREAT THERE'S LIKELY BART AMOUNTS TO REFLECT THAT IS THE- IMPLEMENTATION OF UNIVERSAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN SO. I'M AND. YOU CAN SEE FROM THE CHART YOU HAVE A- AS OVERTIME AT THE PRO. IS PRETTY THEN. AND IN TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. OUR PROJECTIONS TENANTS GET TO BE A- BIT. OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. THE PRE CONDEMNING ABOUT BUT THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU. CREATED IT IN. WE PROTECT AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS. IF THIS IS SO THE CARS. FROM OUR OVER. I'M A FUNCTIONS THERE ARE. CONTINUING BUT- THE DEMOCRATS DECLINES- A PERSON OVER SO YEARS- AGAIN IS WHAT. WITH A BUT I THINK WE HAVE TERMS OF WHAT WHAT WHAT CAN WE- OR ABOUT TO TWENTY ONE. ONE TWENTY TWO. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS INFORMATION ASAP- INFORMATION CHANGES WHEN WE DO OUR UPDATED OUTLOOK PROJECTIONS WILL MORE CORPORATE EFFECT. I'M GONNA STOP THERE AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS WANT BUT IT'S PROGRESS. SHE'S THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE A- LINDEN DR LINDA DARLING I SAW. MAYBE AN ICON OF HERS ON THAT SCREEN A SECOND AGO SO SHE MAY BE READY TO PRESENT. SHE HAD A HARD TIME OF ELEVEN THIRTY TWO PRESENTS SO OF. IF I DR LINDA DARLING HAMMOND IS ON YOU MAY PROCEED. SHE'S PRESIDENT STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU OUR LIVE- THAT'S TERRIFIC REGISTER HERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- GOOD MORNING- DONALD SURE REGARDING MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE IN EDUCATION COMMITTEE AS YOU SAID I'M LITERALLY HAVE A PRESENCE THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION- AND I APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. BOB CLEARLY WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION POINT. IN THE HISTORY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IN THE STATE AND WHILE IT IS A TIME OF ENORMOUS CHANGES AND STESSES IT'S ALSO A TIME OF GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO REAP THANK OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM SO TRULY MEETS THE NEEDS OF. CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN THE STATE- I WANTED TO START BY- NOTING THE LONG TERM TRAJECTORY IN THIS- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS YOU KNOW IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. CALIFORNIA WAS A LEADER IN THE NATION AND THE WORLD IN EDUCATION. R. A. LONG SLIDE FOLLOWED PROPOSITION THIRTEEN- JOHN MERROW THE FILMMAKER CALL THAT THE SLIDE FROM FIRST TO WORST AND BY THE- TIME WE GOT TO TWENTY TEN. A CALIFORNIA WAS YOU KNOW ONE OF THE LOWEST SPENDING ROSE TO CHEATING STATES IN THE NATION WITH ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF- UP SHE PULLS. HER ADMINISTRATOR TEACHER COUNSELOR- AND SO ON AND IT'S BEEN IN THE LAST TEN YEARS THAT THE LEGISLATURE. AND THE GOVERNOR'S AND THE FORMER FIRST GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN AND GOVERNOR- NEWSOME HAS REALLY BEEN CALLING THE STATE CRAFT. IN REMARKABLE WAYS AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE CAN OF THINK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE. USED TO BE WHERE ALL WE WANT TO GO ALL THE TOTAL FUNDING FOR EDUCATION FROM ALL SOURCES INCREASED FROM SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. IN TWENTY ELEVEN TWELVE TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR BILLION. IN. TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO NEARLY DOUBLING. IN JUST TEN YEARS OF THIS SIXTY BILLION WAS ADDED IN THE LAST THIRTY JUST THREE YEARS MOST OF IT- IN THE LAST YEAR- WITH THE IMPENDING CHILD CENTERED SUPPORTS. THAT OF THE LEGISLATURE ENACTED THAT WILL UNFOLD UNDER THE YEARS TO COME I YOU KNOW ABOUT THESE THERE WAS. YOU KNOW BILLION DOLLARS FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT THREE BILLION DOLLARS FOR COMMUNITY SCHOOLS FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FOR MENTAL HEALTH. SUPPORTS NEARLY TWO BILLION FOR AFTER SCHOOL AND SUMMER PROGRAMS ANOTHER BILLION DOLLARS IN SUPPORT FOR ADDITIONAL SET A STAFFING. FOR THE SIX HUNDRED MILLION FOR UNIVERSAL MEALS ON TOP OF THE SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN THE LCS FORMULA. I AND THE POINT I WANT TO MAKE SURE IS THAT WE HAVE YET TO IMPLEMENT. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE OR TO FEEL THEIR EFFECTS. IN OUR SCHOOLS SO IT'S GONNA BE CREDIT WE IMPORTANT. THE COMING YEAR AND THE YEAR TO COME THAT WE SPOKE ON ALL INPUT. THAT WE BRING THESE ARE. TO LIGHT WAYS THAT ARE SUPPORTER OF CHILL. FAMILIES EDUC AND SCHOOLS THAT WE REMOVE. BARRIERS THAT MIGHT STAND IN THE WAY OF SUCCESS AND WE ARE MAKING HEADWAY IN PROGRESS WE'RE BEGINNING TO BUILD BACK BETTER- SO WE WANT TO BE SRE THAT WE'RE- STRATEGIC IN HOW WE APPROACH. THIS YEAR ALL OF THE UNCERTAINTIES THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING THAT I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HEARING ABOUT- THE UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT ENROLLMENTS FOR EXAMPLE OR NATIONAL PHENOMENON- OF. FUNCTIONING CALIFORNIA DECLINING BIRTH RATES THAT WERE ALREADY UNDER WAY STATE MIGRATION TO THE COST OF HOUSING AS WELL AS THE PANDEMIC SOME HAD THE ABILITY GROUPS- BUT ALSO IN HOUSEHOLDS HIT WITH INCOME AND SECURITY. SOME YOUNG PEOPLE HAD TO GO TO WORK OR CARE FOR YOUNGER SIBLINGS SO THAT THEIR PARENTS COULD WORK. BUT AS WE SAW AT THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR MANY FAMILIES WANT TO RETURN TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT ARE SAFE. WELCOMING AND SUPPORTIVE SOMEONE TO RETURN VIRTUALLY BECAUSE THE REMOTE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT IS ACTUALLY WORKING WELL FOR THEIR CHILDREN. BUT THE NUMBERS ARE GOING TO DEPEND ON MANY VARIABLES INCLUDING OF BOTH THE COURSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH PUBLIC SCHOOL OPTIONS ARE MADE APPEALING. TO PARENTS AND FAMILIES. I JUST WANNA- AS I MENTIONED BEFORE POINTS ARE GOING TO MAKE- I WANT TO MENTION THAT ALSO THE BILL BACK BETTER ACT. WHICH HAS PASSED THE HOUSE. WELL IT IS COMING TO THE SENATE IN WASHINGTON DC I INCLUDES AN ADDITION TO OUR T. K. INVESTMENTS FOR THE COMING YEAR. FOUR HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN SUPPORT FOR STATES FOR CHILD CARE AND UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL FOR THREE AND FOUR YEAR OLDS SO AS WE THINK ABOUT HER MOMENTS WERE THINKING ON THE ONE HAND. ABOUT THE FLUCTUATIONS AND SOME TO CLIENTS BUT ALSO THE VERY SUBSTANTIAL ONRAMP. FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS AND UNIVERSAL TICE IN CALIFORNIA AND FOR THREE YEAR OLDS THAT WILL. BE SUPPORTED BY- FOR FUNDS. AS WELL AS THE STATE FUNDS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THIS TO. ALTHOUGH YOUNG PEOPLE SWELL WITH PRIDE LAST IN YOUR TO COME FACED TO LET AS YOU KNOW WITH THESE CHEN. TO ROMANS WEAR STAFF THAT MAKE. STAFF SO HARD TO FIND DO WE CLOSE SCHOOL BUILDINGS EVEN IF THAT EXACERBATES OUR MOMENT PROBLEMS. BECAUSE DISAPPOINTED PARENTS COULD LEAVE ENROLLMENTS TO FIND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE PROBLEM BOTH IN TERMS OF THE SHORT TERM ISSUES. OF THE DESTRUCTION AND THE LONG TRADITION. OF SUPPORTING LEARNING RECOVERY AND DEVELOPING A SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR ALL OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. SO THERE'S SEVERAL THINGS THAT. ARE ON THE AGENDA I THINK BUT TO DO FIRST IN TERMS OF SMOOTHING THE PATH. TO THE FUTURE- WE KNOW THAT- IT'S- UP TO STATES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ARE FINDING WAYS AS AS WE UNDOUBTEDLY WELL TO SMOOTH. THAT PATH OF OUR RECENT INVESTMENTS ARE PROVIDED A SHORT TERM QUESTION. A WHILE ENROLLMENT ADJUSTMENTS BECOME CLEARER AND FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE THE CAPACITY INFRASTRUCTURE IS SOMEONE I'VE TALKED TO A NUMBER OF. SUPERINTENDENTS OF LARGE DISTRICTS. WHO WOULD OF BE IN A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND PRESCHOOL PROGRAMMING EFFECTS INCENTIVIZED TO CREATE THAT EARLY ON RAMP TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS. I THINK THAT I THINK IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT TO USE TIME AND RESOURCES. STRATEGICALLY RIGHT. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO. USE THE HUGE OF ONE TIME. FOR THE FEDERAL. AS AS THE STATE TO ENABLE THE COHORT OF STUDENTS TO CATCH UP AND ACCELERATE. WE'RE ALREADY SEEING LEARNING GAINS OCCURRING THIS FALL IN MANY DISTRICTS- BUT IT WILL NOT WORK FOR MOST TEACHERS TO LOOK IT UP ALL THE GRADE LEVEL STANDARDS AND MARCH THROUGH THEM. WITH THE STRICT PACING GUIDE AND EXPECT THAT TO WORK FOR MOST OF THEIR STUDENTS. SO SEVERAL THINGS ARE GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR USING TIME STRATEGICALLY. A ONE IS TO REALLY FOCUS ON TEACHING THE BIG IDEAS AND THE CONTENT AREAS AND USING TECHNOLOGY TO LEVERAGE GREATER LEARNING. LAST YEAR WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT THE LEGISLATURE ASKED THE STATE BOARD TO DEVELOP GUIDANCE USING TECHNOLOGY EFFECTIVELY TO TEACH THE MOST CRITICAL STANDARDS AND LITERACY AND MATH. AND WE HAVE A JUST RECENTLY SENT AN INCREDIBLY HELPFUL THE SOURCE TO THE FIELD THAT DOES EXACTLY THAT OUTLINES THE BIG IDEAS IN THE CALIFORNIA STANDARDS OF RESOURCES FOR TEACHING THEM. AND DOCUMENTS THE BEST USES OF TECHNOLOGY TOOLS- AND I'M ALREADY GETTING FEEDBACK FROM EDUCATORS AROUND THE STATE OTHER THAT'S HELPING THEM THINK ABOUT HOW TO USE THEIR TIME. MORE EFFECTIVELY AND THEIR TOOLS MORE EFFECTIVELY. THE THING IS THAT WE CAN CREATE A SENSE OF INTERVENTION PROGRAMS. THAT MEET STUDENTS WHERE THEY ARE AND ACCELERATE THEIR PROGRESS OF THE BENEFITS OF HIGH INTENSITY DURING ONE TO ONE OR IN SMALL GROUPS ARE EXTREMELY LARGE ONE TUTORS ARE WELL TRAINED- AND THOSE CAN BE TEACHERS OR PARA PROFESSIONALS. THERE'S A BIG LITERATURE ON THIS NOW ON PAGE FOUR OF MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY THAT I HOPE YOU HAVE. IN FRONT OF YOU YOU CAN SEE THAT. WE HAVE VERY SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE OF HOW TO ACHIEVE LARGE GAINS ARE FOR STRUGGLING READERS OFF FOR STUDENTS WHO NEED TO CATCH UP IN MATHEMATICS- FOR EXAMPLE THE LAST TEN YEARS. EVERY DAY IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING DURING THIS LAST YEAR THE PANDEMIC FOUNDER STRUGGLING READERS DOUBLE THE GAINS I ALMOST FORGOT TO THE AVERAGE READER IN JUST A SEMESTER. OF FOCUSED ATTENTION- THERE'S A SPANISH SPEAKING. OF THAT PROGRAM TO BE HANDLED WRAPPED WHICH HAS HAD SO A PRESS GAINS. A. I. R. SAID THAT IT PRODUCED IN OF A MAN WHICH RARELY SEEN EDUCATE FROM. OF ANY LAST YEAR THE BUDGET. A TWO POINT PROFESSIONALS. FOR THE MORNING RECOVERY PROGRAM. I ENCOUNTERED A THAT UNIVERSE SO ALL JUST. CAN OUT HOW TO GET PARA PROFESSIONALS AND TEACHERS TRAINED UP TO VERY VERY PRECISELY. PICKUP WHERE STUDENTS ARE AN ACCELERATE THEIR PROGRESS- AND WE I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THAT SB- ENORMOUSLY SUCCESSFUL IN MANY DISTRICTS ARE DOING THAT. WHAT THEIR FEDERAL FUNDS AND WITH THE FUNDS THAT HAVE COME FROM WORKING RECOVERY FROM THE STATE. WE ALSO CAN BE INVESTING IN SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING IT SUPPORTS AS MANY DISTRICTS ARE DOING AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES- AND WE KNOW THAT THESE WILL IMPROVE BOTH BEHAVIOR AND ACHIEVEMENT. NOT ONLY IN THE MOMENT BUT OVER THE LONG HAUL OF FROM THE RESEARCH THAT'S BEEN DONE. AND SO WE- THAT'S A PLACE THAT WE CAN INVEST THAT WILL TRANSFORM LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS IN SCHOOLS. AND THE LIVES OF THE STUDENTS TO EXPERIENCE THOSE PROGRAMS AND VIOLATE TO INVEST INTENSELY. IN STAFF RECRUITMENT RETENTION AND TRAINING TO ELIMINATE TEACHER SHORTAGES SUPPORT LONG TERM EXPERTISE AND STABILITY. BOTH THE FEDERAL ARPA FUNDS AND THE MAJOR INVESTMENTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR. MADE LAST YEAR IN THE EDUCATOR WILL. CAN BE USED TO RECRUIT PREPARED FOR. PIPELINE FOR HIGH NEED FIELDS AND SCHOOLS TO BOOST CONFIDENCE THAT. RECRUITMENT RICHARD BONUS ARE. A CALL. WARTS TEACHER TO LOWER SCHOOL. WHERE THEY CAN OFFER EXPERTISE. AND ALSO MENTORING TO NOVICE TEACHERS SO THAT THEY BECOME EFFECTIVE THEY STAY. FOR THE LONG TERM AND WE FOUND AND JUST TO STUDY OF THIS PAST FALL THE LEARNING POLICY INSTITUTE THAT DISTRICTS THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STABILIZE STAFFING. HAVE USED ALL OF THESE TOOLS AND THEY'VE BEEN BUILDING UP THEIR OWN HIGH RETENTION TEACHER RESIDENCY PROGRAMS- AND SETTING THEMSELVES UP FOR SUCCESS IN THE LONG HAUL SO THAT THEY WON'T CONTINUALLY HAVE TO EXPERIENCE. THOSE KINDS OF SHORTAGES OF A NUMBER OF DISTRICTS ARE USING ALL OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND MY WRITTEN TESTIMONY I DESCRIBED THE- SENATE ACTIVITIES OF LONG BEACH UNIFIED. OF THAT HAVE PUT ALL OF THOSE ELEMENTS IN PLACE AND ARE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS. WITH THE STUDENTS THAT ARE COMING BACK AND THOSE THAT ARE PLANNING TO COME ON BOARD IN THE EARLY CHILDHOOD SPACE. AND FINALLY BEGIN YOU SPACE STRATEGICALLY- IN BOSTON THE QUESTION OF DO WE NEED TO CLOSE SCHOOL BUILDING BECAUSE OF DECLINING ENROLLMENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME. WE JUST PUT IN A LOT OF OUR FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY SCHOOLS THAT WILL UNFOLD OVER THE COMING YEARS A THIRD OF THE SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA WILL BE ELIGIBLE. FOR FUNDING THAT ALLOWS THEM TO CREATE WRAPAROUND SERVICES HEALTH CENTERS ON MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS SOCIAL SERVICE SUPPORT BEFORE AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS ADULT EDUCATION TO CREATE. A COMMUNITY. OF PUBLIC. ABOUT WOULD- BENEFIT FROM THE SCHOOLS BEING A TO LEASE ADDRESS. JUST COMMUNITY. ALLAH HELP PROVIDERS ANOTHER COMMITTEE. THAT ARE FINE THEMSELVES. OUT OF MANY MORE COMMERCIAL VENUES THE FOUR BILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED LAST YEAR TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WILL ALSO IDEALLY PLACED MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. ONSITE AT SCHOOLS. OFFERING GROUP AND INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING ADVISING FOR STAFF. THAT SPACE CAN BE WELL USED A LEASING SPACE TO MENTAL EALTH PROVIDERS COULD TRANSFORM ACCESS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. WHO REALLY STREETS DATEABLE BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT ARE STUDENT CENTERED- AND FINALLY REACH SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO SUPPORT THE LEARNING MODELS THAT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WATCHED. A LOT AND I JUST WOULD KNOW THAT WE CAN RECOGNIZE IN THIS MOMENT OF THAT IT'S TIME TO RETHINK THE FACTORY MODEL SCHOOL DESIGNS THAT WERE CREATED A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. AND USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT WILL LEARNING MODELS THAT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WANT OUR CURRENT SCHOOL MODELS WERE REATED DURING THE ERA WHEN HENRY FORD'S ASSEMBLY LINE. WAS THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY ONE BUREAUCRACY WAS THE MODERN FORM OF ORGANIZATION AND WHERE YOU EUGENICS DETERMINE HOW TEACHERS WERE TO BE TESTED. HOW CHILDREN WERE TO BE TESTED TRACKED AND TREATED. THEY WERE NOT PARTICULARLY DESIGNED FOR CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS FOR TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FORMS OF DEEP LEARNING FOR ALL CHILDREN. OR FOR EDUCATIONAL EQUITY AND OUR IRAQ EDUCATORS HAVE BEEN PUSHING ON THE EDGES OF THIS INHERITANCE SYSTEM. FOR A LONG TIME ABOUT THESE ASSUMPTIONS OF THE OLD MODELS ARE DEEPLY INGRAINED IN OUR SYSTEMS THAT WE'VE INHERITED. AND THEY DO INFLUENCE THINGS ABOUT HOW WE ORGANIZE CLASSROOMS STEPPING STEEP TIME TEACHING TEXTBOOKS AND TESTING. US SO WE'RE HEARING FROM A LOT OF DISRICTS THAT WANT TO REALLY REINVENT THE WAY THEY- OFFER SCHOOLS A USING CHECK. OF FOR. ALL ALL MORE AND MORE WHERE IT'S APPROACH. OF WHERE THEY- FOR EXAMPLE STOOD. BLENDING ALL OR WITH A JOKE COURSES- ALONGSIDE IN PERSON CLASSES AND OFFSITE APPRENTICESHIPS AND INTERNSHIPS ARE THEY MIGHT DO THOSE THINGS- IN ONE DAY OR IN SEVERAL DAYS OVER THE COURSE OF THE SCHOOL WEEK. OF APPLYING THEIR LEARNING IN MEANINGFUL WAYS CONNECTING WITH STUDENTS IN OTHER SCHOOLS ARE CONNECTED WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGE COURSES THAT ALLOW THEM TO GET A JUMP START ON THEIR COLLEGE CAREER- AND SO WE NEED TO THINK FLEXIBLY ABOUT THE USE OF TIME AND SPACE FOR LEARNING. SO WE DON'T INADVERTENTLY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR PARENTS OF STUDENTS TO GET WHAT THEY NEED FROM PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND WE GET ALSO AT THIS MOMENT. DEVELOP PATHWAYS TO THE FUTURE- AND EFFICIENCY. BY ALIGNING EXCITING AND EXPERIENCE ALL HIGH SCHOOL PATHWAYS OF DUAL CREDIT COURSES. OUT WITH CAREERS IN FIELDS THAT ARE IN HIGH DEMAND SUCH AS COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING GREEN TECHNOLOGIES ALL TEACHERS. INCLUDING OUR MUCH NEEDED PATHWAYS TO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION TO MEET THE NEEDS WE WILL HAVE. FORTY KIDS TEACHERS AND OF FOR THOSE THREE OR FOUR YEAR OLD PRESCHOOL DOLLARS THAT ARE COMING IN SO YOU CAN IMAGINE A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TAKING DUAL CREDIT COURSEWORK AT A PRACTICE YOUR PLACE BUT THAT EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. TO BE LEARNING AND EARNING WHILE GAINING AN INITIAL CHILD DEVELOPMENT PERMIT WHILE STILL IN SCHOOL ADDING ANOTHER PERMIT WELL IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE WORKING PART TIME AS A SUPERVISED TEACHERS THEY- EVENTUALLY WENT. HERE SHE IS READY TO PLANNING A CREDENTIAL THAT BUILDS ON THE STACKABLE PERMITS IN A WIDE UNIVERSITY PROGRAM. IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO PURSUE THEIR PASSIONS IN A WIDE RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND CREATE STRONG VIABLE PATHWAYS TO THE FUTURE. AND WE NEED TO USE THIS MOMENT IN PART TO MANAGING THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL SYSTEM A. THAT WILL ALLOW US TO MARSHALL ARE OUR- AND RESOURCES TO THAT EDUCATION FUTURE OUR CHILDREN. THAT IS SUPPORT AND SUCCESS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE DOCTOR LYNN DARLING FOR ALWAYS IN A FOR. TESTIMONY YOU VERY MUCH I WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO GO ON TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER. WHICH IS- MICHAEL PHYNO CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AFFECT MATT MISTER FIND YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE CHAIRS MAJORITY LEADER AND MEMBERS I'M MICHAEL FONG CEO THE STATE'S FISCAL CRISIS AND MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE. YEAH FACTUAL FORECASTED DECLINING ENROLLMENT IS THE GREATEST THIS FINANCIAL AND FISCAL- RISKS BUT LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES YOU'RE EXPERIENCING MOSTLY RELATED- AS WE DISCUSSED THIS MORNING IS THE TOPIC OF DECLINING AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE OR ADA HOWEVER ADA'S INFLUENCE IN TWO WAYS FIRST BY THE DECLINING ENROLLMENT IF YOU WERE STUDENTS OBVIOUSLY THE PEOPLE RADIATE SUCKING ARE YOU CALLING ATTENDANCE RATES SOMETIMES IS REFERRED TO AS YOUR- ALL MY COMMENTS WILL FOCUS DECLINE IN ROME. AS WHITES THE CLIENTS IN A TENER RATE THEMSELVES CAN BE GREAT LEGAL BY ALLEN I'M SURE THAT STILL ENROLL HER VEHICLE PROPERLY SIR MARC SAID AND EIGHTY ATS MARC. WE CAN EXPERIENCE IN THE CON A ROLE FOR NEXT PERIOD TOM DICK AND IS NOT NEW AS THE KNOW HIGHLIGHTED- EARLIER. AND IS NOW A ANTICIPATED. WHAT DO NEW IS IT APPEARS TANK HAS EXCEL. THE RATE OF. WE CAN'T GET MAKE IT 60% OF OUR WERE DECLINE BLAST YOU ALL ONE OF THE FIFTY EIGHT POUNDS IF THE STATE AUDIT DECLINE. IN IN ALL. LOWER BIRTH RATES APPEAR TO BE IN FACTOR AS THE CHAIN IN MY EARLIER COMMENT. BASED CAN BE THE L. DO NOT FOR ALL. THE QUOTE UNQUOTE MISSING STILL THAT WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THIS FALL. EARLY FALL TWO THOUSAND ONE ON A ROLLING DATA TRY APPEAR TO REFLECT ADDITIONAL. WELL EXPECTED LEVELS OF RECOVERY FROM LAST YEAR'S DRAMATIC IN MOMENT WE KNOW THIS FROM OUR SURVEY COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION FOR FIRST MONTH OF ATTENDANCE- SURVEY DISTRICTS AND TALK WITH HER. YEAH AS THE ELEMENT WE DON'T HAVE A IT. USING VIDEO AFTER ESTIMATES FOR THE NEXT DECADE THE STATUS BAR TO HAPPEN NOW BECAUSE OF CLOSE TO NINE. WITH NINETEEN COUNTY LOSING THAT ARE RIGHT. THAN THE STATE. OUR MOST POPULOUS COUNTY LOS ANGELES IS FORECASTED TO DROP BY APPROXIMATELY 20% IN SCHOOL AGED IN HOME. BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC CARE A. EIGHT HARMLESS. DISTRICTS WITH TWO CONSECUTIVE YEARS OF ROBERT KLEIN'S AND NOT YET FELT THE FISCAL IMPACT FEWER STUDENTS. IT WILL BE IMPACTED BY THE ACCUMULATED DECLINE NEXT FISCAL YEAR TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE. QUICKFIRE TWO YEARS OF DECLINE. WE CALL THIS THE FUNDING CLIP AND IT'S BEEN REFERRED TO EARLIER THIS MORNING. IN OTHER COMICS. I'M NOT AN ADVOCATE FOR SIMPLY DELAYING THE IMPACT BY ADDING ANOTHER YEAR HOLD HARMLESS BUT I AM AN ADVOCATE FOR CHANGING THE WORKERS TAKES ABOUT CLIP. LOOK MORE LIKE A GRADUAL SLOPE AND I THINK THAT CAN BE DONE RELATIVELY EASILY. ON THE SHORT TERM THERE ARE NOT FISCAL EQUITY FOR THIS RESULTING THE DECLINE IN ROME. WELL THE A. O. AND OF FINANCE CAN SPEAK TO THIS WITH MORE. THE STATE IS PART TO REMAIN A PROBLEM I EIGHT ONE. WE GUARANTEE IS NOW IN BY A DECREASE. IN CASE LOWER. AS SUCH MINIMUM CARE TO YOU GROW DESPITE THE DECREASING EIGHTY EIGHT. THIS PROVIDES THE ADMINISTRATION A LEGISLATURE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIND EIGHTY A HIGHER RATES OR INVESTING IN MITIGATION STRATEGY. THAT SUPPORTS A GRADUAL SLOPE. A FUNDING IMPACTED A LOCAL LEVEL. AS OPPOSED TO THE DEVASTATING CLIP IT'S FINALLY FORECAST. I'M A LONG TERM DEPENDING ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS IT'S POSSIBLE THAT EITHER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT TESTS TO OR THREE BIG GOVERNMENT GUARANTEE AND LOWER CASE WORLD WOULD BE A CONSIDERATION THE STATE LAW. THE FISCAL IMPLICATIONS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS EXPERIENCING DECLINES ARE SIGNIFICANT. BUT USE A SIMPLE SCENARIO TO ILLUSTRATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL REVENUE AND EXPENDITURES. IF AN ALLEY A HAS A DECLINE OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO K. THREE THREE STUDENTS HAVE A CLASS SIZE OF TWENTY FOUR TO ONE. THE LOST REVENUE APPROXIMATES. ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE MAXIMUM NUMBER TEACHERS TO LAYOFF WOULD BE FIVE. FOR A SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY. THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE THOUSAND. ADD A FEW DOLLARS PER STUDENT FOR SUPPLIES AND A POTENTIAL EXPENDITURE SAVINGS WOULD ONLY BE ROUGHLY FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY THOUSAND DOLLARS OR JUST THIRTY SIX CENTS FOR EACH DOLLAR OF RUBBING LOS. THIS SCENARIO SEEMS MAXIMUM THE BISHOP SAID BUT ALL A HUNDRED AND TWENTY STUDENTS ARE TO SAY GREAT SPACE YEAH AND AT THE SAME SCHOOL. MORE REALISTIC WOULD BE TO SPREAD THOSE HUNDRED TWENTY STUDENTS OUT OVER MULTIPLE BRAIDS AND MULTIPLE SCHOOLS AND WHEN YOU DO DOUBT THERE IS NO PRACTICAL IMPACT. ON TEACHERS STAFFING LEVELS BECAUSE THE LOSS OF ONE OR TWO STUDENTS PER GRADE SCHOOL DOESN'T SUPPORT. A REDUCTION IN TEACHERS RESULTING IN PAINTINGS ARE SAVINGS FOR EACH DOLLAR. OF REVENUE LOSS. IN THE SHORT TERM DISTRICTS WILL INCREASE THE DEFICIT SPENDING AND DEPLETE RESERVES ON THE LONG TERM REDUCTIONS IN SUPPORT ANCILLARY SERVICES WILL BE REQUIRED. IN ADDITION TO REDUCTIONS OF DIRECT SERVICE PROVIDERS SUCH AS TEACHERS INSTRUCTIONAL AIDES COUNSELORS SETTLE. AS YOU APPRECIATE THIS ILLUSTRATION. OUR OR SIMPLE PRODUCT BUT NONE THE LESS THIS ILLUSTRATION SHE WAS VERY CONTRARY TO THE FUNDING ENVIRONMENT WORKER WE HAD AND IT MAKES LEAVES IT MAKES CONFRONTING ARE THAT. IMPLICATIONS OF DECLINING ENROLLMENT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR OUR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. WHAT QUESTIONS SHOULD YOU S. POLICY MAKERS ASKED IF YOU CONSIDER SHORT TERM POLICY DECISIONS. I HAVE SEVERAL THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND THE FIRST IS THE QUESTION WHERE ARE THE MISSING STUDENTS. I'M HAVE WE SIMPLY RECAP OF THE CHAIRS ON THE DECK BOARDED A PANDEMIC FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED STUDENT ENROLLMENT. YOUR QUESTION IS WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO ANSWER YET WE CAN SEE FIRST LOOK AT THE DATA. THAT IS TALKING GOES ON AND A DEEPER DIVE- THEY'LL BUILD A DATA DEEPER DIVE ANALYSIS. THESE ARE DEFINITELY QUESTIONS YOU CAN ASK. AND ANSWERED. WHAT SHORT AND LONG TERM FROM. NINETEEN AND OTHER. WOULD SAFETY BURKE. THAT WE STILL HAVEN'T ON. POTENTIAL SEE OR BEEN CONFRONTED WITH. I DON'T THE MOMENT. TO A GRAD SLOW LONG TERM OF THE BILL STANDARD. PROVIDE HONDA UNDER THAT AND ARE TRY TO. ANNEX TEAM. OF UNIVERSAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN BEING AND- WHAT ARE THE ENROLLMENT TRENDS IN THE PRIMARY GRADES COMPARED TO OPERATE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY WE ARE DEFINITELY SEEING TRENDS VERY MEANING THESE DIFFERENT BRAIN SCANS. IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CELEBRATE UNIVERSAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN. RESETTLEMENT ARE FUNDED FOUR YEAR OLDS BEYOND THE CURRENT TWENTY. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR LOCAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN A PLACE IN OUR AREA AND CORRESPONDING ENROLLMENT DECLINE. WE HAVE THE ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ONCE APPROPRIATE EIGHT. I THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER FINE VERY INFORMATIVE AS ALWAYS WILL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT SPEAKER AND WE'LL TAKE QUESTIONS AFTER THIS- NEXT BIGGER AND OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MANDY CORBIN ASSOCIATE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE CINEMA COUNTY OFFICE. OF EDUCATION. GOOD MORNING MR MCCARTY MISTER DONILON COMMITTEE MEMBERS I KNOW THE CARBON HUH SO **** SUPERINTENDENT OF THE RURAL HEALTH AND SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES AT THE CINEMA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. I WAS ASKED TO TALK ABOUT THE SYSTEMS WE'RE IMPLEMENTING AND CINEMA COUNTY. TO SUPPORT STUDENT WELL BEING HOW THE SYSTEMS COLLECT DATA TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND HOW THIS INFORMATION MAY INFORM THE CHOICES. MADE REGARDING FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE WELL EING OF STUDENTS DURING THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES THAT WE FACED. DUE TO DECLINING ENROLLMENT. I BELIEVE I HAVE THE BILL TO SHARE. THANKS FOR BEING PATIENT- X. RAYS I'M GOING TO GO ACTUALLY- FAIRLY QUICKLY- MY SLIDES BECAUSE WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO SHOW ALL OF YOU IS ARE THE DATA THAT WE COLLECT- I DO WANT TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT- I KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU ARE AWARE OF THE SIGNIFICANCE- DISASTERS WE'VE HAD HERE IN CINEMA COUNTY MULTIPLE FIRES BLOOD COULD NINETEEN AND NOW DECLINING ENROLLMENT. HELLO WE EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. TO DECLINE JUST UNDER 17% AND- AND I BELIEVE IN THE LAST. TWO YEARS WE HAVE THEM. SECOND AND FOURTH IN DECLINING ENROLLMENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO WE WILL HAVE TO MAKE VERY CAREFUL CHOICES HERE IN CINEMA COUNTY TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS ALMOST FULL ON IT AND BEHAVIOR LEVINE. THAT IS THE KEY TO STUDENT SUCCESS AND OUR SCHOOLS- THIS CHEN TALKED ABOUT THAT QUITE A BIT EARLIER WELL WHAT ARE THE KEY INDICATORS FOR STUDENT SUCCESS LONG TERM AND I DO WANT TO MENTION ON THE SLIGHTEST IMAGINE I'M GONNA GO FAIRLY QUICKLY THROUGH THESE FIRST ONES ON AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PARTICULAR SLIDE THIS IS ACTUALLY DOES OZ SIX KEY TAKEAWAYS AND BEAMS ON FROM A STUDENT ENGAGEMENT SURVEY THAT WE DO IN OUR COUNTY WHICH I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT TOWARDS THE END OF MY PRESENTATION. WHICH IS YOUTH TRUTH- THIS IS USED IN OUR COUNTY AND TWENTY SIX OF THE FORTY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARM IT JUST UNDER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SCHOOL SITES. SO IT GIVES US A PRETTY GOOD- BROAD REPRESENTATION. OF WHAT OUR STUDENTS ARE THINKING FEELING AND EXPERIENCING ABOUT- ENGAGEMENT IN ATTENDANCE AND LEARNING IN THEIR SCHOOLS. JUST TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF DATA- YOUTH TRUTH SURVEY OF APRIL ARGENTINA REPORT CONSTRUCTS OFTEN OR ALL THE TIME. ARE OVER A HUNDRED- OBSERVER THOUSAND STUDENTS ON THAT IN OUR COUNTY REPORT SERIES WHICH IS THE GREEN SUICIDE. WE ARE MUCH THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF FOR BOTH OF US SO SUBTLE IDEATION AND ALSO VISITS TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR STUDENTS EXPERIENCING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. 34% OF CINEMA COUNTY STUDENTS BELIEVE THERE'S BETTER SCHOOL ARTS PROGRAMS OR SERVICES THAT CAN HELP IF THEY'RE FEELING STRESSED UPSET OR HAVING PROBLEMS- BUT ONLY 32% OF STUDENTS REPORT HAVING AN ADULT SCHOOL. ON THE A. PHILIP THAT THEY CAN TALK TO I'M SORRY FOR JUMPING AROUND HERE- THE OTHER. DATA INSTRUMENT BUT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT IT SO I START WHICH IS- AN ONGOING. YEAH I WAS TOLD WE USE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OUR STUDENTS- OFTEN THERE IS NOT ENOUGH. TO HELP US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OUR STUDENTS AND THEN WE ARE NOT ABLE TO MAKE INFORMED CHOICES ABOUT. EXPENSES I THINK REALLY THE REASON WHY I WAS INVITED TO TALK SOME ABOUT THIS TODAY IS THAT- SADLY I THINK WE'RE AHEAD OF THE CURVE HERE IN CINEMA COUNTY AND- STANDING HOW TO MEASURE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENED TO OUR STUDENTS. SWEETNESS I'M ACTUALLY JUST GONNA SKIP AHEAD TO EARN BECAUSE I WOULD REMARKABLE PEOPLE'S TIME LOOK- AND I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN SEE THE SLIDE- THIS IS A SLIDE- BASED ON SO I START INFORMATION THAT WAS COLLECTED SO I START IS A- TWENTY QUESTION- SCREENING DEVICE THAT ACTUALLY WE'RE NOW ELECTRONIC. ALL WE CAN SEE THE SAMPLES- IN THE WAKE OF A DISASTER OR ANYTIME WE WANT TO FAMILIES AND STUDENTS- AND GET THIS WITH THIS- SCREENER ANSWERED AND WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH OUR KIDS WE CAN. GET THE INFORMATION BY CLASSROOM SCHOOL SITE DISTRICT AND COUNTY WIDE- THIS IS BEEN PARTICULARLY HELPFUL FOR US- DURING ON. THE LAST PART OF THAT. SO IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE SLIDE- THIS ACTUALLY HAS ABOUT A THOUSAND RESPONDENTS- WE HAVE ABOUT 38% OF OUR KIDS WE CAN NO RIGH OFF THE BAT ESPECIALLY AS SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS. AND DIRECTING RESOURCES- AND MONEY- YEAH WE'VE GOT 38% OF THE KIDS THEY'RE THEY'RE DOING OKAY- BUT WE'VE GOT. HALF THE KIDS THAT ARE IN THE RED. AND SO THEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE PIE CHARTS DOWN BELOW WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR KIDS- WE'VE GOT YOU KNOW HERE JUST UNDER 5% OF KIDS ON THE RECORDING THAT IT HAD DEATH. OF FAMILY FRIENDS HERE'S- DEATH ABOUT PAT A WEIRD AND ALSO ABOUT 5% ALONE THE IS A AT THAT WE HAVE 20% OF THESE KIDS- ARE. ACTIVATED FELT TRAPPED EARNED SO THIS GIVES US GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO OUR KIDS. THIS IS ANOTHER CHART WAS DONE RECENTLY HI THIS IS A SMALLER GROUP OF STUDENTS FROM ONE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN WEST SENECA COUNTY AND THAT WAS IMPACTED BY BOTH FIRES AND FLOODS AND COOK AT NINETEEN. ON IN REGARDS TO COULD NINETEEN THIS PARTICULAR AYE TWENTY QUESTIONS I START WAS ADJUSTED TO INCLUDE THOSE QUESTIONS WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT- SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT. THE FIRST ONE TO THE STUDENTS ARE SCARED TO HELP LIST- DID YOU HAVE TO EVACUATE THIS PARTICULAR ON ELEMENTARY SCHOOL YOU CAN SEE THAT 70% OF THE CHILDREN WERE EVACUATED ON AND THIS AS I MENTIONED THE QUESTIONS OF THIS PARTICULAR SCREENER CAN BE ADJUSTED. TO WHAT'S GOING ON- WE COULD ADJUST THE QUESTIONS TO THINGS LIKE SCHOOL CLOSURE DECLINING ENROLLMENT WILL ALSO FEATURE- THERE WERE PARTICULARLY SCHOOL CLOSURES ULTIMATELY OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS TEACHER LAYOFFS. AND WHAT THIS WILL DO TO THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THE CHILDREN FEEL WITH THEIR SCHOOL SCHOOL CLIMATE SCHOOL CULTURE. SO THIS IS A VERY- MUCH SMALLER GROUP AGAIN AND WE CAN LOOK HERE THAT A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE STUDENTS ARE PARTICULARLY IMPACTED THIS HELPS US TO DIRECT OUR RESOURCES AGAIN- I WILL SHOW THIS PARTICULAR SLIDE DOWN FOCUS ON THIS. FROM THE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE. AND FOR ALL OF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT OUR ENTIRE STATE- AND WHAT'S HAPPENING TO OUR KIDS. SO THE SLIDES THAT I JUST SHOWED YOU- WEAKENED AND GEO MAP. THE DATA THAT WE- DRAWDOWN BASED ON THIS PARTICULAR INSTRUMENT. SO WE CAN SEE THAT OF THE SCHOOLS THAT ON THIS PARTICULAR SLIDE BASED ON. WE'VE GOT A 100% OF THE KIDS THAT HAVE SOME INDICATOR THAT SEND THE BREAD- WE CAN LOOK AT THE ONE SCHOOL AND I UP AND REMOVE THE SCHOOL NAMES- BUT- THE ONE A PARTICULAR CHURCH WHERE WE DO HAVE SOME STUDENTS THAT ARE FUNCTIONING AND AGREED- BUT IF WE WERE. DOING THE DATA FOR THE WHOLE COUNTY THEN FROM WILL COUNTY OFF PERSPECTIVE AND A PARTICULARLY FOR A LARGER DISTRICT ARE LARGEST DISTRICT OF SANTA ROSA CITY SCHOOLS ON THEIR SUPERINTENDENT AND OTHER FOLKS WOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AT WHICH SCHOOLS HAVE. THE HIGHEST INDICATORS OF NEED AND THEN THAT HELPS US TO DIRECT OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND COUNSELING SERVICES PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES AND THEN- THE PURPOSE FOR SHOWING YOU THE OTHER CHARTS EARLIER WAS TO LOOK AT THE QUESTIONS IN THE INDICATOR SO WHEN WE TALK TO OUR STAFF. ABOUT YOU KNOW FOR ASK QUESTIONS FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT TEACHER LAYOFFS WILL CLOSURE THAT WOULD HEP US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THAT JUST STUDENTS OF THE TRIAGE TOOL THOUGH I START TO GET USED FOR ADULTS- IT IS ALSO IT'S AN INSTRUMENT THAT'S BEEN USED BY FEMA OTHER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ON OTHER STATES- PLACES AFTER HURRICANES. SO IT GIVES US QUICK INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT DIRECTING OUR RESOURCES ALSO GIVES US LONGITUDINAL. INFORMATION ON. BUT I WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT USE TRUE- AS I MAY. THIS USED BY TWENTY THREE OF OUR FOR DESTROY IS THE YOUTH TRUTH DATA IN PART FROM TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY- OUR OFFICE OF EDUCATION IS USING. OF OUR- MONIES THAT YOU HAVE DIRECTED OUR WAY TO OFFSET THE COST OF THIS FOR ALL THE SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS AND CINNAMON. WANT TO USE THIS INSTRUMENT. THIS PARTICULAR YEAR OF. WE SURVEYED HI JUST UNDER TWELVE THOUSAND STUDENTS- SO THESE ARE THE HERE AGAIN THIS IS A INSTRUMENT THAT CAN. TO THE SITUATION- I DID WANNA TALK JUST BRIEFLY ABOUT A THREE SLIDES I WANT YOU TO ALSO KNOW THAT THIS DATA CAN BE. AGGREGATED AND THEN RE AGGREGATE BY A GRADE- ETHNICITY- SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS- SO THESE ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT WE USE WHEN WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS A PARTICULARLY AT THE COUNTY OFFICE LEVEL ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO DIRECT OUR RESOURCES TO ASSIST DISTRICTS- SEND PERSONNEL ON OUT INTO THE SCHOOLS TO SUPPORT THEM- SO THIS PARTICULAR SLIDE SHOWS- BASED ON CODE. HOW STUDENT CENTER COUNTY OF THOSE TWO THOUSAND OUR FEELING ABOUT- YOU KNOW THEIR LIFE AND HAVING THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE AS I MENTIONED ARE COUNTY IS VERY HIGH- STATISTICALLY COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL. AVERAGE OF STUDENTS. IN A LOT OF SIGNAL. DISTRESS RELATED- MENTAL HEALTH EMOTIONAL HEALTH SLIDE ON MEASURES FIRE IMPACT- STATE OR IS THAT- IF YOU LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS SLIDE HOLDEN- STUDENTS THAT ARE HAVING SIGNIFICANT THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE CASE BACK OVER THIS TWENTY PERCENT FIRE IMPACT NOT A LOT OF DIFFERENCE- CHILDREN HERE OUR COUNTY WE'RE GOING ON NOTE FOR FIVE YEARS NOW OF THINKING ABOUT FIRES. STUDENTS AND WESTERN CINEMA COUNTY FIRES FLOODING CO THAT BEING OUT OF SCHOOL ON AND NOW WE ARE FACING WE DID HAVE- TWO HIGH SCHOOLS MERGED. IN THE SUMMER COUNTY. HI A LOT ABOUT AND FEELINGS ABOUT THAT DURING DIFFERENT- TO EDGE THE- CLIMATE BRINGS TO GET. A LOT OF EMOTIONAL- OUR TEAM FROM THE COUNTY OFFICE PROVIDES A LOT OF SUPPORT AT THAT PARTICULAR SCHOOL ON BECAUSE- IT COUNSELING STAFF PEOPLE ARE HAVING TO BUILD INFRASTRUCTURE VERY QUICKLY- AND NOT STUDENTS. GO INSIDE THERE AND WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE FUNDING THAT YOU HAVE DIRECTED ON TO THESE SERVICES- I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF WRAP UP- WITH OBSTACLES TO LEARNING THAT STUDENTS HERE ARE IDENTIFYING. AGAIN WHEN WE ON THE OTHER. ON PRESENTATION WITH THE EARLIER PANEL TALKING ABOUT ATTENDANCE AND ENGAGEMENT AND WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS AND HAVING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIND OUT WHAT THOSE ARE AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OUR STUDENTS- THIS IS ANOTHER SLIDE FROM YOU'VE TRUTH THERE ARE THERE MANY DATA POINTS WITHIN YOU THE TRUTH- BUT THESE WERE THE ONES THAT I CHOSE TO SHOW YOU TODAY. ON YOU CAN SEE THAT ON. CINEMA COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ON COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. SURVEY DURING A SIMILAR TIME- FEELING ANXIOUS- YOU KNOW. CAUSES THEM TO HAVE DIFFICULTY WITH LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. AND 20% HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE- ACTUALLY DISTRACTIONS AT HOME OR LESS- THAT THIS WAS MORE SO I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT THAT JUST. THAT EXCITED THAT STUDENTS FEEL AND- I THINK JUSTIN'S THREE HERE IN SUMMIT COUNTY AGAIN. THINKING ABOUT THAT- IF AND MISTER FIND WITH KNOWS THE EXACT STATISTICS BUT I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE THE THIRD OR THE FOURTH HIGHEST. DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS AGAIN JUST UNDER SEVENTEEN PERCENT. IN SO BE MINDFUL. FOR HOW WE SPEND OUR DOLLARS. AND CONTINUING TO DIRECT THEM AT THOSE KEY INDICATORS THAT I START. BUT THE STUDENTS INDICATED WHICH HAD TO DO WITH- YOU KNOW FEELING BELONGINGNESS AND HAVING A RELATIONSHIP. WITH SOMEONE AT SCHOOL. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT HOW WE DIRECTOR DOLLARS AND- HAVING DATA. IS IMPORTANT DO THAT- JOHN ANDERSON WHAT ARE BARRIERS WATERS FEEL WORST EXPECT ALSO HOW THIS FITS EXACTLY FOR YOU- I WAS ASKED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT. AND HIGHER I APPRECIATE YOU LISTENING I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DATA- I BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL HAVE A- COPY OF THE ENTIRE. PRESENTATION TO ACTIVE ON THE ALWAYS HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT HOW ABOUT THE WORK BEING DONE HERE IN CINEMA COUNTY. REGARDING STUDENTS THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. I THANK YOU MISS CORBIN FOR YOUR DETAILS YOUR YOUR DATA- IN REALISTIC PICTURE OF WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE THANK YOU THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA GO ON TO OUR- OUR LAST SPEAKER FOR THIS PANEL THEN WE WILL TAKE QUESTIONS. IS LAMONT JACKSON INTERIM SUPERINTENDENT FOR THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. THANK YOU SO MUCH SIDE YEAH. YOU MAY PROCEED THERE ABOUT ALL. CHAIR MCCARTY I AM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AS MENTIONED- MY NAME IS DR LAMONT JACKSON. AND THE CROWD INTERIM SUPERINTENDENT. AT SPENDING A UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND I HAVE HELD MANY DIFFERENT ROLES IN OUR DISTRICT. I INCLUDING BEING A STUDENT OF OUR DISTRICT. ARE GRADUATE- ALONG WITH BEING A CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEE. A CERTIFICATED TEACHER A PRINCIPAL OUR CHIEF HUMAN RESOURCE OFFICER. AREA SUPERINTENDENT AND DIE. AND NOW THE MOST IMPORTANT- ROLE I WAS PASSED TO- LEAD OUR DISTRICT THROUGH- THIS AND DAMAGE- AS YOU KNOW THERE'S ANY UNIFIED'S DISTRICT IT'S THE SECOND LARGEST DISTRICT. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA A SERVING NEARLY ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS- OUR STUDENT POPULATION IS VERY DIVERSE- WITH UP ALMOST BOTH ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED- AND- TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDES LUMINARY. UPDATES IN TERMS OF THE IMPACT ON ON THE DAMAGE BUT I DO WANT TO START BY SAYING THANK YOU TO CHAIR MCCARTY. THERE ARE. DONALD R. AND STATE SUPERINTENDENT TONY BERMAN- UP BEING IN SCHOOLS. I WANT TO GET THANKS TO OUR LEADERS. WHO ARE TEACHERS ARE CLASS APTAMERS OUR STUDENTS AND OUR FAMILIES ARE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING DESPITE THIS INCREDIBLE CONTACTS THAT THAT WE ARE AND SO- I WANT TO SAY OUR STUDENTS ARE SHOWING UP AND SHOWING OUT. I THINK IN INCREDIBLE WAYS AND AS WE HAVE HEARD A TESTIMONY TODAY- WE HAVE A GREAT- JOURNEY AHEAD OF US- BUT I'M SO. HOPEFUL- IN IN THE SUB THAT THAT WERE FROM MY LIFE MUCH. IN TERMS OF OUR- DECLINING ENROLLMENT AND FISCAL IMPLICATIONS I WILL SAY THAT THIS IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM AND MR CABRAL MENTION THIS IT'S PAST MONEY. I'M THAT. THIS IS NOT NEW BY THE EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMIC. IN THE SEVEN YEARS PRIOR TO- THE PANDEMIC- STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE. WE SAW DECLINING ENROLLMENT- AND ON AVERAGE- WE WERE SAYING LESS THAN ONE PERCENT. IN TERMS OF AVERAGE DECLINE. WHEN WE COMPARE THAT TO OUR PROJECTED ENROLLMENT HOWEVER DURING THE PANDEMIC- WE HAVE YOU KNOW THIS PANDEMIC CHATS LED THIS A PRECIPITOUS DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT DURING THAT TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR- WE SAW ALMOST 3% TWO POINT AGAIN BAD MIRRORS WHY MR BRAWL MENTIONED THIS TRANSLATED INTO A LOSS OF ALMOST. THREE THOUSAND. ARE LESS THAN PROJECTED. THIS IS START THIS IS A STARK CONTRAST- TO OUR- YOU KNOW HALF A PERCENT DECLINE IN THE PREVIOUS YEARS. I AM NOT YOU KNOW AS WE SAW DECLINES ACROSS THE GRADES BANDS IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT WE DID SEE A GREATER WINDS IN OUR LOWER GRADE THAT WAS MENTIONED AS WELL AS EARLY TESTIMONY. OR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR- WE ANTICIPATE ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN PERCENT. DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT- WHICH WHILE THIS IMPROVES OUR- ARE MOVED FROM TWO POINT NINE ALMOST THREE PERCENT. IT IS LIKE NEVER GET AWAY HIGHER THAN OUR HISTORICAL AVERAGE OF THE. IN SUMMARY OF WHAT WE THINK ABOUT THAT THE PANDEMIC. I HAS RESET OUR ROMANCE- DECLINE SUBJECT THREE- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THIS IS WHY THAT THE- HELP ARE LESS. I DURING A PANDEMIC PROVIDED US WITH US IT'S VERY UP FISCAL. STABILITY TO CONTINUE SERVING OUR STUDENTS- AND EXPANDING THE THAT THE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. FOR STUDENTS TO NOT ONLY RETURN BY TO ENGAGE AND SELLER. SO FOR THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE SCHOOL YEAR- THE PHASING OUT OF THE HOLD HARMLESS THIS COULD MEAN I'M FOR OUR DISTRICT. ALMOST FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS- IN OUR BUDGET- AND WHILE THIS IS CERTAINLY IT MAY SEEM AN SIX AND BONTA CONSOLE- IN TERMS OF THE CONTEXT OF DISTRICTS BUDGET- THIS REALLY HAS AN IMPACT ON STAFF. IT'S WERE BENEFITTED FROM THESE A ONE TIME OUT. I WOULD ALSO ADD THAT SENDING A UNIFIED HAS CHOSEN TO IMPLEMENT MEDICATIONS- THAT W KNOW HAVE HELPED TO ENSURE OUR STUDENTS REMAIN HEALTHY. AND SAFE AND DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND NOW THESE ACTIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS REMAIN IN SCHOOL- WHICH IS WHY ARE WE ARE REQUIRING UNIVERSAL MASKING INDOORS AND OUTDOORS. I AS WELL AS- BAXEEN REQUIREMENT. THAT WILL BE COMING UP BY. STARTING OUR OUR SECOND SEMESTER. FOR ALL OF OURS AND STAFF ARE WE ABLE THAT THE ACTS ARE GOING TO MAKE OUR SCHOOLS SAFE- AND YOU KNOW REALLY GIVE FAMILY'S COMFORT. AS THEY LOOK TO RETURN TO OUR SCHOOLS. OUR NEXT I WANT TO FOCUS ON OUR- A DUPLICATE ACCOUNTS- IN THIS PANDEMIC AT CERTAINLY IMPACTED US I IN TERMS OF OUR UNDUPLICATED NUMBERS- AND THIS REALLY CAPTURES. OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE LOW INCOME ARE ENGLISH LEARNERS ARE FOSTER YOU. AND UNDER THE L. C. ABOUT A SCHOOL DISTRICTS MAY RECEIVE SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION GRANTS- WHEN THEY'RE- I'M DUPLICATE ACCOUNTS. ARE AT LEAST FIFTY FIVE PERCENT- LICORNE ROMAN UNFORTUNATELY ARE UNDUPLICATED COUNT IS AT STEADILY DECLINING. I DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR ARE UNDUPLICATED ACCOUNT STOOD AT FIFTY NINE PERCENT- FOR THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR WE ANTICIPATE- IT'S GONNA BE AROUND FIFTY FIVE POINT SIX PERCENT- THIS IS. WHAT THIS WILL MEAN FOR US IS LESS FUNDING. I TO SUPPORT OUR OUR GREATEST. NEED STUDENTS. AND DURING THE PANDEMIC- WE WORK TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS WORK BAD. AND UNIVERSAL A MEAL- PLANS- WERE IN. PLACE OUR GROCERIES MORE AVAILABLE AND- THIS IS WHY WE DID APPRECIATE THE UNIVERSAL- MEALS SCHOOL MALES- BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT OUR OUR COMMUNITY IS NEEDED S. AND WHILE THIS UNIVERSAL ASPECT- OF SCHOOL MEALS. MEANS THERE'S- NO LONGER AN INCENTIVE FOR FAMILIES TO SUBMIT THE FORMS NEEDED FOR US TO TRACK OUR AND DO DUPLICATE ACCOUNTS. WHICH IS CRITICAL TO OUR LCS ARE FINDING IT SO- I WANT TO ENCOURAGE US TO THINK ABOUT THIS- AND SO THIS IS CERTAINLY A TRADE OFF THAT WE FACE- AND- IT'S CERTAINLY. SHOULD BE COMMENDED- THAT WE HAVE THIS POLICY- WE CERTAINLY WANT TO URGE THE STATE TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO IDENTIFY- FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS- AND WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO THINK OF WAYS TO DO THIS SITE WE DON'T HAVE. ANY CONCRETE ACTIONS AT THIS TIME- IN OF OUR IN THIS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER AS WELL- THE DYNAMIC BUT I JUST MENTIONED- ARE THE CATALYST AND TO WATCH AND IT WHERE ARE OUR ART STUDENTS GOING- THIS IS VERY COMPLEX I THINK- AS AS BEEN MADE IN EARLIER TESTIMONY. IN THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO WE CAN POINT TO THE HOME VALUES AND THE COST OF LIVING INCREASES- AND THESE INCREASES HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL OUT WHICH MEANS THAT THERE ARE LESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND YOUNG PROFESSIONALS- TO LIVE IN THE CITY- BUT BEYOND THIS- I WOULD SUGGEST THAT SOME OF OUR- ANECDOTES AND PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS- THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES IN TERMS OF WHAT IS CONTRIBUTING TO OUR DECLINING ENROLLMENT- THE FIRST IS THE TRANSFERRED TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS- I THINK THIS IS A- YEAH. THAT WE FACE- PARTICULARLY- WHEN WE LOOK AT- THE MANDATES THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE. AGAINST BALI- TRANSFERS TO OUR- OTHER PRODUCTS ARE BETTER AND THEY THE SURROUNDING COUNTY. AND ALSO STUDENTS WHO ARE TRANSFERRING OUT OF THE STATE- ANY OF THESE- YVERDON AT EACH OF THE DEPARTMENT MOMENT YEAR OVER YEAR- THIS MEANS LESS FUNDING- AND AGAIN. IT'S GOING TO UP. FACE CHALLENGES ON US AS WE LOOK TO MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL PARTS OF THE- I'M FINALLY I WANT TO. TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR ROUTE RECOVERY PLAN AND- AT SOME OF THESE COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN MENTIONED EARLIER BUT- UP WE HAVE PRIORITIZE LEARNING ENRICHMENT- AND OUR INVESTMENT IN EARLY EDUCATION AND MENTAL HEALTH. ARE THE PAST THIS PAST SUMMER- WE HAVE PROVIDED OUR STUDENTS WITH THE DOORS LOCKED I'M- AND WEBER ERRING ADULTS- ARE. INTO A PROCESS THAT WE ALL LEVEL OF SAN DIEGO. LOVE LOVE SB A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH. TO LOOK AT- LEARNING SUMMER LEARNING AND ADDRESSING THE LEARNING LOSS THAT MANY PEOPLE TALK ABOUT AND THEN THE ENRICHMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO PREPARE STUDENTS ACADEMICALLY. AND SOCIALLY EMOTIONALLY I TO BE WITH YEARS- INCITING- OUTSIDE ACADEMICS AT THESE ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDED FORMING ARTS CAMPS. ASK BRYANT'S AMPS AND MANY STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN HOW TO STIR UP FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME. HI IN TOTAL WE SERVED UP ALMOST THIRTY THOUSAND OF OUR STUDENTS AND SAW A 15100% INCREASE IN ENROLLMENT OVER THE BOOK NUMBER. INSTEAD OF A UNIFIED I BUSINESS WAS ONLY THE BEGINNING. A KEY PRIORITY FOR US WAS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF UNIVERSAL TRANSITION- AND ARDEN- THIS UNIVERSAL TKA WAS. INCREDIBLE AND WE- THE WORK OF WITH THE LARGEST. EGGMAN AND THANK YOU TO WATCH YOUR MCCARTY UPPER COMING DOWN VISITING WITH US THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP TARGETS. IN BENDIGO- WE'VE BEEN PLANNING I'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTED A UT K. FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS. AND WE LAUNCH THIS PROGRAM AND WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS ALL OF OUR SLOTS AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS WERE ELEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY STUDENTS ENROLLED IN OUR A UNIVERSAL T. K. PROGRAM AND- CERTAINLY THIS HAS NOT- YOU KNOW REDUCED OR ELIMINATED OUR HIGH. AVERAGE THE IN STUDENT ENROLLMENT UP BUT IT'S CERTAINLY HAS- LINDA DARLING HAMMOND MENTIONED. IT PROVIDES AT THE ON RAMP UP OUR STUDENTS TO GET INTO OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM I HAD TO STAY IN OUR SCHOOLS. AND SO- WE CERTAINLY SEE A STRONG DEMAND IN EARLY- LEARNING IN OUR COMMUNITY AND DOES CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO EXPANDING TO. MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL OF THE STUDENTS ARE ARE FOUR YEAR OLDS AND THAT WITH FEDERAL FUNDS LIKE TO EXPAND YOUR THREE YEAR OLDS TO PROVIDE EARLY LEARNING TO ALL OF OUR STUDENTS WHO WANT TO BE IN OUR SCHOOLS- AND SO LOOKING FORWARD TO SUPPORTING AND MEETING THE GOAL OF OUR OUR STATE'S UTK GO. I'M FINALLY- AS MENTIONED EARLIER AND- THE SHORTAGE OF TEACHERS AND CLASSIFIED STAFF NEED TO BE. YOU TOO ARE RECOVERY- AND WE HAVE. ESTABLISHED ONLINE ACADEMY. WELL BEFORE I ENDEMIC. OUR TO FIND OPPORTUNITY FOR STUDENTS TO. MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF RECEIVING A DIPLOMA UP THROUGH A VIRTUAL ACADEMY AND- WE HAVE EXPANDED THAT TO BE THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS WHO WISH TO REMAIN- OFF CAMPUS OUT OR AT THE RETURN OF LEARNING- YELLING THIS TO AN ENTIRE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS BEEN CHALLENGED- AND WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR INDEPENDENT STUDY- ONGOING. I'M PARTICULAR WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR BACK THE BANDAID THERE THERE WILL BE A NEED. OUT THERE WILL BE AN- AGENT TRUMP AFFECT- AND SUPPORTING. THIS IDEA- I WOULD SAY I'M MUCH LIKE OTHER DISTRICTS- WE ARE HAVING IT ALLEN DEFINING. I AND LINDA DARLING HAMMOND MENTIONED- WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT I BLINDS WE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP WITH UCSD. ABWEHR WE LOOK TO- HEY FOR- AND INCENTIVIZE- OUR OUR STUDENTS TO BECOME EDUCATORS I TO ALLOW THEM TO GO TO A LOCAL UNIVERSITY- AND ACHIEVE THEIR GOAL OF BECOMING A TEACHER SO THE- ARE THEM. AND INCREASE THE NUMBERS OF A TEACHERS THAT WE CAN- FROM- THERE ARE SOME AREAS WHERE THE STATE AND IMPROVED IN EASE THE BURDEN- TO OFFER INDEPENDENT STUDY- WALLEM MAINTAINING HIGH STANDARDS AND QUALITY OF EDUCATION. AND ALSO- YOU KNOW FUNDING PROGRAMS UP OR PER TEACHER PIPELINES. I'M GONNA END BY- THAT AS YOU CONSIDER INVESTMENTS IN OUR CALIFORNIA'S THAT WE REALLY CONSIDER. ABILITY AT DANA BLOODY RIGHT IT'S THE PROGRAM THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE OR NOT- THIS SENTIMENT WHAT MADE. IT WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO TOP BUT THOSE DOLLARS IN OUR FAITH FUNDING- AND ALLOW US TO SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS OUT MENTAL HEALTH SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING I ACT- REAR. OP OP THANK YOU SO MUCH. BUT THANK YOU ARE SUPER JANET JACKSON VERY INFORMATIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WITH THAT WE'LL GO TO Q. AND A FOR THIS- LAST PANEL- FROM THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE I'M GONNA START OUT WITH ONE ANSWER IS FOR A MISTER FINE. ARE YOU STILL HERE MR FUND. YES CAMPUS SOME NOTES- BUT I CAN'T FIND THEM SO I'M JUST GONNA SHOOT OFF THE COVER. ARE YOU TALKED ABOUT THE CLIP TO MAKE TURNING THE CLIFF INTO A SLOPE. AS FAR AS- THE FISCAL CLIFF WITH REGARD TO- DECLINING ENROLLMENT- WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE. TO MAKE IT- TO CREATE A SLOPE INSTEAD OF A CLIFF. I IMAGINE. BUILDING UP THE BASE WOULD BE ONE OF THEM MAYBE YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT OR MAYBE SOME OTHER ALTERNATIVES. TO CREATING THAT SLOPE THAT YOU DISCUSSED. SURE WELL I. SO THERE ARE SPECIFIC TO THE TOPIC OF DECLINING ENROLLMENT- WELL ONE OF THE IDEAS THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSION WITH WITH- VERY STAFF- WOULD BE THE USE OF A- THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE. OR EIGHTY EIGHT. ARE FOR TEMPORARY PERIOD OF TIME SIX FIVE YEARS- SHOULD THE FORMULA WOULD LOOK MORE LONG- THE HIGHER AT THE CURRENT YEAR. SO THAT WE CAN HELP I CANNOT FOR GROWTH DISTRICTS. FOR THE PRIOR THREE YEARS. ROLLING AVERAGE ABA. FOR NEXT YEAR TWO TO THREE ABOUT- CHANGE THE CLIFF TO. GRADUAL SLOPE ARE BECAUSE THE PRIOR THREE YEARS WOULD BE. NINETEEN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AS A PROXY FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO S. AS MR BALL OUTLINED EARLIER IN THE COULD NOT PROCESS. THE REASON FOR THE THREE YEAR AVERAGE IS WE CURRENTLY USE THAT METHODOLOGY ARCTIC TO COMPUTE THE ARTICLE TODAY PEOPLE PERCENT EACH VISIT FOR YOU AVERAGE IN PART TO STABILIZE THE YEAR TO YEAR CHANGES IN THE NUMBER. IT'S ALSO CURRENTLY THE PROCESS BEING USED TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL I THINK THERE ARE MERGING SEA FUNDING ALLOCATION. I DON'T RECALL THE EXACT TITLE OF THE FORMULA BUT. IT IS ALSO. USING A YEAR AVERAGE. IS BEING ABLE TO AT ON. IN OUR- GOING TO CALL TO STAY. THEIR FUNDING THIS PERIOD TIME AS WELL. ALL IT DOES ACOSTA OKAY BUT AGAIN I'M TEST ONE OF PROP NINETY EIGHT WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IS LIKELY AFFORDABLE THE REASON FOR THE TEMPORARY COULD ALSO BE PART MORE PERMANENT BUT THE REASON FOR THE TEMPORARY WE WOULD SUGGEST MAYBE FIVE YEARS AFTER TWENTY SIX TWENTY SEVEN. ARE THE REASON FOR THAT IS IT WOULD BUT IF WE LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. YOUR FORECAST. AND IF WE AGREE THAT THE PANDEMIC IS XCELERATED GOT FORECAST- DAN. PROBABLY ACCELERATED BY WITH ROUGHLY HALF WHICH MEANS THAT OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. WE WOULD SHIP HELLO MARK- NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO DURING THAT SAME PERIOD OF TIME. IS THE IMPLEMENTATION. OR TRANSITIONAL CAN UNIVERSAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN ALWAYS BEGIN TO SEE THE BENEFITS- ON THE FINANCIAL SIDE IF YOU WILL OF THAT INTERPRETATION. SO THAT WOULD BE ONE IDEA WITHOUT CHANGING THE ALSO YEAH- WE ALSO HAVE. TO YOU KNOW HAS. VERY SWEET CAN TO IT BUT- BUT SUCH NEED COMPILE IS AVERAGE DAILY TO- ADVERSELY TO THAT- THE IDEA OF- NEED TO ROLL IT BASED ON WHO WITH ALL THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS- WHILE THAT'S WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION- THAT LONGER TERM. AND SIMPLY MOVING TO ENROLLMENT BASED DOESN'T SOLVE THE ISSUE BECAUSE- BECAUSE THE CLIP THE MAJORITY OF THE CLASS APPEARS TO BE A LOSS OF STUDENTS NOT A LOSS- ATTENDANCE- AND YES IT DOESN'T SOLVE THAT IMMEDIATE ISSUE SO THAT WOULD BE ONE IDEA- THAT- FOR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU. APPRECIATE THAT- AND THEN FOR A FIRM FOR MISTER JACKSON FROM SAN DIEGO UNIFIED COULD YOU JUST TALK TO US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR ONLINE SCHOOL HOW DOES THAT WORK AND STUDENTS- POP INTO THE ONLINE SCHOOL THEN GO BACK TO THEIR- TO THEIR QUOTE UNQUOTE REGULAR SCHOOL HOW DOES YOUR ON MY SCHOOL WORK IS A K. TWELVE. TO K. TWELVE QUEUES TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU ZERO DOWN OH I YEAH SO. I'M WE HAVE- BUMPERS AROUND WHEN STUDENTS CAN. ENTER AND EXIT- THE ONLINE- OR WHAT WE CALL A VIRTUAL ACADEMY. AND SO. I STUDENTS. WHO HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO RETURN BECAUSE OF- THE PANDEMIC- WHETHER THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT THE MEDICATIONS THAT ARE IN PLACE- OR WHATEVER THEIR THEIR FAMILIES DECISIONS ARE- WE HAVE STAFF. AT THIS SCHOOL. I'M WORKING WITH OUR OUR LABOR PARTNERS JUST LIKE WE WOULD STAFF- ARE IN PERSON SCHOOLS. AND THAT STUDENTS DO YOU HAVE- SOME ONLINE. I THERE ARE SOME- OPPORTUNITIES FOR. IN PERSON CHECK INS IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO. AND WHEN STUDENTS CHOOSE TO RETURN THAT THEY CAN RETURN TO THEIR- A SCHOOL OF RESIDENT. I HAVE NO QUESTIONS ASKED- THERE ARE STUDENTS TO- SOMETIMES MADE SHOES OR CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES MOVED INTO PARTS OKAY TO ME. I WOULD LOOK AT THOSE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS- BUT GENERALLY WE LOOK AT GRADING PERIOD SO THAT THERE IS- ENTRANCE. AND EXIT INK- IT HAS MOVED THEIR CAPACITY. THAN JUST POPPING IN AND OUT. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS REMAIN IN A COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF MR KILEY. I THANK YOU I HAVE A QUESTION FOR- THE- MS CORBIN- I WANT TO JUST GO BACK TO THESE SLIDES ON. THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE WITCHER ARE REALLY ALARMING AND- MAYBE LOOKING AT THE ONE THAT IS- IT CATEGORIZED BY COPE WITH THE FACT COULD YOU JUST EXPLAIN THE SIDE A LITTLE MORE LIKE WHAT WERE THE STUDENTS ASKED EXACTLY SURVEY AND WHAT IT ASKS IS- AS RELATED TO. MOBILITY HAVE YOU DURING THIS PAST YEAR OUR- SUICIDE- THERE IS. OBVIOUSLY IT'S OVER TIME AND THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT ARE YOU ACTIVELY- I THOUGHT SINCE THE SIDE THAT'S A DIFFERENT INDICATOR FOR US CLEARLY AND WE DO A THREAT ASSESSMENT THAT STUDENT- BUT THIS SAYS THAT YOU KNOW FOR YOUR OLDER JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO IDENTIFY. AFTER THEY HAD THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE AS IT RELATES TO COME THE NINETEENTH AND EARLY HELP FOR US IS TO LOOK NOT ONLY AT THE DATA PROVIDED BY USE TRUTH THAT IS DONE ANNUALLY BUT TO USE I START AT SCHOOLS THAT HAVE HAD SOME TYPE OF CRISIS- HAVE BEEN IMPACTED. BY DISASTER AND GIVES US ON IN VERY FAST INDICATORS ON BIG NOT SO WE DISAGGREGATE THAT DATA BY STUDENT. SO THEN WE CAN LOOK AT THIS QUESTION. THAT VEHICLE SERVICES I DON'T KNOW QUICKLY ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ON THAT SURE THE CONCERN AS OKAY SO STUDENT QUITS YES THEY CANNOT OUR THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE ON THERE AND JOHN HOW DO WE GET THEM IN SUPPORT OF GREAT. SO WE HAVE. MULTI TIERED SYSTEMS OF SUPPORT REALLY BUT WE HAVE A MULTI DIMENSIONAL WAY. STUDENTS ENTER THREAT ASSESSMENT. THANK YOU THAT'S HELPFUL AND JUST IN TERMS OF THE SORT OF SIGNIFICANTLY MODERATELY SOMEWHAT I MEAN HOW IS THIS ASKED LIKE WHERE THEY ASKED SHOULD WE BE ADDING UP 23% PLUS 12% PLUS 11% FOR THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO ABOUT ANY SORT OF THOUGHT OF IT OR IS. THAT YOU KNOW IS ONE SORT OF A INCLUSIVE OF THE OF THE LOWER DEGREES OF. CONSIDERATION WHAT IN SOME WAYS I DON'T DISAGREE WITH YOU WITH THE CONCEPT OF ADDING IT UP I MEAN WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE. IN FIVE AND SO IT'S REALLY HOW FREQUENTLY ALL SIX SUICIDE THIS PURPOSE. SO IS THAT TWELVE LIKE 12% DOES THE 23% INCLUDE THE TWELVE PERCENT- OR WERE THESE KIND OF ASKED TO SEPARATE QUESTIONS DO YOU SIGNIFICANT THEIR- RIGHT THEIR SEPARATE SO JUST LIKE ANY SURVEY THAT YOU WOULD TAKE WE'RE ASK YOU SOMETHING ON A SCALE OF. ONE TO FIVE- THIS THERE WILL BE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO SAY SOMEONE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE SAY MODERATELY. AND A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO STATE YOU KNOW SIGNIFICANTLY SO THOSE ARE UNDUPLICATED RESPONSES ACTUALLY. I SHOULD. THANK YOU AND THEN I'M JUST A QUESTION FOR. AS SUPERINTENDENT JACKSON WITH THE SAN DIEGO UNIFIED ARE YOU MENTIONED A FEW TIMES THAT YOU ONE OF THE CAUSES OF REDUCED ENROLLMENT IS- IS PARENTS WHO- HAVE AN ISSUE WITH SOME OF THE POLICIES THAT THE DISTRICT HAS ADOPTED. I THINK YOU MENTIONED ONE OF THE THAT STUDENTS ARE TRANSFERRING TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE MANDATES YOU HAVE WHAT MANDATES ARE YOUR FRIEND TO. SO WE LOOK AT OUR- ARE MEDICATIONS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE WHETHER IT BE- TESTING- WHETHER BE THE MASS MANDATE WHETHER BE- PUSHING AND ENCOURAGING. OF FOR VACCINE- WHAT WE NOTICE IS THAT A LARGE MAJORITY OF OUR FAMILIES. ARE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT GETTING SICK ON OUR CAMPUSES- AND TAKING THAT HOME. I TO- FAMILY MEMBERS OR L. AND SO. SOME SOME DISAGREE WITH- YOU KNOW THE MASKING THAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF. OUTDOOR MASCOT AND SO. THOSE COULD BE SOME REASONS WHY CHOOSING TO LEAVE. THANK YOU AND SINCE YOU BROUGHT UP IN WITH THE OUTCOME ASKING THAT ISN'T REQUIRED BY THE STATE AND ALL THE STUDIES I'VE SEEN SHOWN IT DOESN'T REALLY HELP WITH STOPPING TRANSMISSION OF THE VIRUS. BUT YET YOU'RE SAYING IT'S CAUSING. OFFICE FOR THE DISTRICT IS YOU HAVE THE POLICY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN WE LOOK AT- YOU KNOW CODE IN KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR NUMBERS COMPARED TO MANY OF THE DESERT STORM WE PAID ATTENTION. UP WE HAD YOUR- RATES OF INFECTION IN CASES- AND- THE SPREAD SO I THINK- THE MEDICATIONS THAT WE HAD IN PLACE- WE'RE DEFINITELY KEEPING OUR OUR KIDS SAFE AND I WOULD SAY. I MANY OF OUR FAMILIES MOST OF OUR FAMILIES WERE REALLY IMPRESSED WITH THAT I THINK IT TO YOUR POINT- SOME FOLKS TO SEND WHILE YOU'RE GOING BEYOND THAT- AND SO I DON'T I DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE HARD DATA YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE ANY SURVEYS AND SAY THAT. I'M I'M JUST MAKING. A NOTE THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY IN THAT COULD BE A CAUSE FOR PEOPLE TO MAKE A DECISION SHOULD CHECK OUT IT. I SEE AND I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK OF YOU AND EVERYONE IN THE DISTRICT AND- I'M ALWAYS LOOKING TO LEARN MORE THOSE DID YOU HAVE ANY INORMATION SHOWING THAT THE- OUTDOOR MASK POLICY IN PARTICULAR HAS LED TO LOWER- TRANSMISSION- I WOULD SAY. SUGGEST THAT IT'S NOT ONE- A MITIGATION STRATEGY BUT A COMPREHENSIVE MITIGATION STRATEGIES. SO I DON'TKNOW THAT WE COULD WE COULD PULL OUT ONE COMPONENT- AND SUGGESTS THAT. I WILL MAKE NOTE THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE PAYING CLOSE ATTENTION TO IS. ONE WE DO HAVE THE REDUCTION OF OUR OUR CASES. HOW DO WE- BACK SOME OF THE MEDICATION. AND MAYBE NOT HAVE. THE OUTDOOR MASKING SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO OR- WE'VE HAD- MASKING FOR OUR ATHLETIC PROGRAMS AND- THINGS OF THAT NATURE FOLLOWING. OUR PARTNERS- ARTS ARTS SCIENCE PARTNERS AND OUR MEDICAL PARTNERS. AT UCSD SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THESE- MITIGATION STRATEGIES TO SEE WHERE WE CAN- BACK FOR EXAMPLE THE COLT FORTY. I HAD OUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS- YOU KNOW IS THAT MANDATED NO BUT FOR CONTACT TRACING HAS BEEN VERY BENEFICIAL. AND I WOULD SAY IF WE LOOK AT OUR RATES- THERE IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AND WERE. YOU KNOW AS I SAID THE SECOND LARGEST IN IN THE STATE. OF THE LARGEST IN THE COUNTY- AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR RATES. I WOULD SAY COMPARATIVELY- THEY HAVE BEEN REDUCED- BUT I. AGAIN GOING BACK TO YOUR MAJOR POINT OF. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE GET ALL OUT ONE PARTICULAR MEDICATION I THINK IT'S MORE OF A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE. OF MITIGATION STRATEGIES. THANK YOU CHAIR I BELIEVE THIS IS A QUESTION FOR MR FINE AND JUST WANTED TO GO BACK TO YOUR HIGHLIGHTING OF THAT HAVE THE COST OF THE OTENTIAL COST SAVINGS I THINK YOU SAID THIRTY SIX SENSE. OF SAVINGS FOR EACH DOLLAR OF REVENUE LOST THAT IN AN OPTIMAL STAFFING SITUATION- MS PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR- AT OF FOR EACH DOLLAR REVENUE LOST- IN THAT KIND OF LIKELY MORE- REALISTIC PERSPECTIVE WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE THAT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS AT A LOST ACROSS SEVERAL GRADES JUST TRYING TO KIND OF SQUARE THAT- WITH ANY- SUGGESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE DEALING WITH THE EMINENCE NOTION OF NEEDING TO FOCUS IN ON SCHOOL CLOSURES. AS THEY'RE LOOKING AT IT DURING COLD ED AT AS THEY'RE LOOKING AT AND TRYING TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT BUDGET OUT LOSS IF THEY ARE GOING TO BE FACING OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS AT I THINK AT THE OUR SUPERINTENDENT FROM SAN DIEGO INDICATED THAT THERE ARE LIKELY GOING TO EXPERIENCE A FIFTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR BUDGET DEFICIT- I KNOW THAT- SUPERINTENDENT KYLA JOHNSON TRAMMELL THAT INDICATED THERE WAS PROBABLY ABOUT A FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR OR MORE BUDGET DEFICIT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE FACING SOUTH. THIS TRIED IF- SPEAKS IF YOU COULD SPEAKS. TO THE IDEA OF SCHOOL CLOSURES RIGHT NOW AT THE MIDST COALBED- IT GIVEN THE DECLINING ENROLLMENT THAT PEOPLE ARE LIKELY FACING IN OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND THE AT THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT A DOCTOR DARLING HAMMOND LAID OUT WHICH WHAT WE REALLY FOCUS ON MUCH MORE INTENSIVE INTERVENTIONS. FOR STUDENTS. NUMBER BONTA REPLIED CALIFORNIA TIME OUT LIKE A TEMPORARY CLOSURE DUE TO QUARANTINE OR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT- SUCH A REDUCTION IN STUDENTS AND LOCAL SCRIPTED BABY NO LONGER GOING TO OPERATE THAT PARTICULAR SCHOOL SITE GOING FORWARD. IN THE IMMEDIATE IN THE IMMEDIATE MOMENT LOOKING AT SCHOOL CLOSURE AS ONE AWAY TO BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THAT LIKELY AT DECLINE THE IMPACT. OF THE DECLINING ENROLLMENT OVER TIME. THANK YOU- ALL SO FIRST OFF I THINK ALREADY THAT ANY SCHOOL CLOSURE PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT DECISION BUT A GOVERNING BOARD HAS TO MAKE THE LOCAL DISTRICT- OUR SCHOOLS ARE CENTRAL TO THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS IN OUR COMMUNITIES- AND THAT'S JUST A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION RIGHT WE DON'T. WE DON'T LIKE TO MESS WITH BUS SCHEDULES AND BUS ROUTES AND WE DON'T LIKE TO MESS WITH HER SCHOOL BOUNDARIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT THOSE ARE ALL VERY DIFFICULT HIGHLY CHARGED ISSUES- LET ME SAY THIS I. IT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE DECLINE THAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW. BILLS IN AND OF ITSELF THE REASON TO GO CLOSEST SCHOOL ARE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD AND SHE CAN BE KIDS AROUND AND REDISTRIBUTE BACK. IT MAY BE THAT THIS DECLINE IS THE LAST. YOU'RE A TEN YEARS OF DECLINE- AND THAT WOULD BE THE CASE IN A NUMBER OF DISTRICTS AND THEREFORE IT MAKES FINALLY THE ISLAND IT'S PROBABLY THE PERIOD OF TIME WHICH PUSHES ON TO THAT CONSIDERATION- I. THERE'S AN IDEAL PROCESS WITH REGARD TO CLOSING SCHOOLS IF YOU GOT THAT NUMBER ONE- I THINK YOU JUST LOOK AT THE WHOLE DISTRICT COULD NOT. BE A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WOULD APPEAR TO BE. ARM ALL THE- TARGETED LACK OF BETTER WORD TARGETED CLOSER TO YOU LOOK AT THE WHOLE DISTRICT YOU ANALYZE THE HOME NEEDS OF THE DISTRICT INCLUDING- THE EXPANDED PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE BOARD PRESIDENT- SPOKE ABA COMMUNITY SCHOOLS AND OTHER THINGS OTHER TYPES OF PROGRAMS- POTENTIAL SPACE FOR- STAFF DEVELOPMENT- EIGHT AND OUR TEACHER CORPORATION I'M AT A LOCAL LEVEL- BITS OF TYPES OF PROGRAMS- OFTEN THEY'RE FIGHTING. FOR SPACE- YEAH THE OTHER THING THAT I IS A TO CONSIDER HERE IS WHEN YOU WHEN YOU. STUDENTS AND CAN CLOSE A GIVEN CLASSROOM. THAT PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY WELL PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY- TO FOR UNIVERSAL TKO AS WE ARE EMBARKING ON THE APP IT PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY FOR UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL WHICH ARM WRESTLING DARLING HAMMOND POINTED OUT- ON WITHOUT COMING OUR WAY. ATTENTION TO THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY FOR SPECIALTY PROGRAMS ATTRACTED PROGRAMS ARE STEM STEAM. ARE ALL TIGHT OUR DUAL LANGUAGE IMMERSION ALL TYPES OF ACADEMIC PROGRAMS THAT I'M COULD ACTUALLY ATTRACT ALL STUDENTS TO THAT SCHOOL AND SO I THINK THE LOWEST IS ALMOST IN LESS OF THE OPPORTUNITIES. THAT A FEW OPEN CLASSROOMS IN WHAT LIKELY BEING. ANY YEARS OF IMPACTED SPACE- GRACE TO A SCHOOL DISTRICT SOME OF THOSE WILL BE INCREASED EIGHTY EIGHT. SOME OF THOSE WILL INCREASE ENROLLMENT SOME OF THOSE WILL POSSIBLY PROVIDE A GREATER OPPORTUNITY FOR- LEARNING- AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR SERVICE- OUR FOR OUR STUDENTS. OUR CLOSING A SCHOOL YUP COSTS BECAUSE THE SCHOOL ARE RELATIVE MINOR SAY AN ELEMENT SCHOOL PROBABLY THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR RANGE BECAUSE THE BULK OF THE COST OF OPERATING THE SCHOOLS WITH YOUR TEACHING STAFF HERE STRUCTURAL AIDS AND YOUR VARIABLE STAFF ARMED AND THEY'RE GONNA MOVE A STUDENTS RIGHT IF YOU CLOSE GOAL EIGHT AND MAY HAVE SCHOOL AGE KIDS TO SCHOOL B. AND C. THEY'RE GONNA MOVE WITH THE KIDS TO SCHOOL BEING C. AREN'T ZERO ONLY SAVINGS IS OUR PRINCIPLE ON OFFICE MANAGER I HAD TO STILL BE ON THOSE ONE PER SAKE. FIX NO MATTER WHAT THE SIZE OF THE SCHOOL IS TYPE OF STAMPEDE SO IT'S RELATIVELY MINOR THE GREATEST REVENUE. POTENTIAL OF CLOSE IS ONE YOU ENTER IT INTO YOUR UP WHEN YOU. MANAGER ENTERED INTO LEASE RIGHT. ARE OR AND- SELL WITH SIGNS ON OPPOSITE THAT ONE TIME ONE TIME FUNDS WHICH ARE. LIMITED IN WHERE YOU CAN USE THAT WHICH ARE ARE WILL BE A GETTING STARTING ON. I BELIEVE NEXT YEAR WELL AFTER WE CATCHING REAL BOB ARMIES THAT SPOT. ALL SO I. HOPEFULLY I DON'T YOUR- NUMBER BONTA L. THANK YOU MISTER PRIME TO DIDN'T QUESTIONS YEAH MR MCCARTY YEAH I THINK MISTER FINE SPOKE ABOUT THIS BREWING BETWEEN GO BACK TO MR CABRAL WITH THE L. A. L. ARE YOU THERE AT YOUR- YEAH FROM HERE YEAH SO DO YOU HAVE ANY- RECOMMENDATIONS OR IDEAS HOW WE COULD LOOK AT HOW WE DO EIGHTY EIGHT IN CALIFORNIA. WITH ATTENDANCE ISSUES RELATED TO- ENROLLMENT AND ACTUAL ATTENDANCE AND YOU KNOW GOING FORWARD I KNOW YOU OF COURSE YOU MENTIONED THAT THE HOLD HARMLESS THAT WE'VE BEEN ZEROED IN ON FOCUSED ON DURING THIS PANDEMIC BUT GOING FORWARD. ANY SUGGESTIONS OR RECOMMENDATIONS YOU MAY HAVE FOR US. WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I WOULD HAVE MADE A FEW ISSUES THAT I THINK HAVE BEEN MENTIONED. I'M INCLUDING IT THE BIG ONE BY US OF A NUMBER OF MCCARTY I'M SO I DON'T WE I DON'T. I DO NOT RECALL A TIME WHEN THE STATE HOUSE- HAD IN ATTENDANCE BASED R. OR SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF AN ATTEMPTED STRUCTURE BUT ONE CHANGE THAT WE DID MAKE IN THE MID NINETIES WITH TO- WE USED TO ALLOW FOR IT. EXCUSED ABSENCES THAN DISTRICTS FOR GENERATE FUNDING FOR OUR KIDS WE MOVED AWAY FROM THAT- AND TOOK THE PARTS OF JUSTICE STUDENTS ARE NOT ACROSS FROM THERE ARE COMING I THINK. THE REASON WE HAVE OUR SYSTEM IS BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT WE DO NOT COLLECT PAYMENT DATA. BUT THERE IS THE THERE ARE OFTEN TIMES WHERE THERE'S LESS ATTENTION PLACED ON GETTING STUDENTS. ARE PREDICTIONS ARE OFTEN STRUGGLING AND MAYBE HAVE BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS OR OTHER CHALLENGES AND THERE'S A LOT OF COMMITMENTS CONSERVE OUR GATE KEEPING IN THE CLASSROOM SO I THINK THAT IS A- CONCERN THAT THAT THAT IT. WE HAVE WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHETHER TO MOVE TO ENROLL BASED MODEL BUT WE DO. HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT A LOT MORE MOVING AWAY AND WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS WOULD BE. THE OTHER THING THAT I BELIEVE WAS MENTIONED- IT IN THERE IT MIGHT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FROM- PRESERVATIVES WORKS IF THAT. ARE WE RIGHT NOW COLLECTS CENSUS WE HAVE EIGHT ONE DAY YEAR OCTOBER CENTERS BASED MODEL AND SO WE DEFINITELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THAT YOU MOVED TO AN ENROLLMENT BASED MODEL THAT. ONLY LOOKS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR ENROLLMENT AND PROVIDE FUNDING BASED ON MODERATE USE THAT CREATES AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE. THERE MAY BE IS AN INTEREST IN GETTING STUDENTS AND ALL THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR AND THEN NO INCENTIVEFOR THEM TO MAINTAIN STAY IN ROLE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR SO YOU WOULD NEED TO MAKE CHANGES. IN HOW YOU USE THAT ENROLLMENT DATA IN ORDER TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WOULD CONTINUE IT COULD NOT HAVE THE ARE SORT OF. A POTENTIAL THAT THERE'S CONCERN THROUGHOUT THE YEAR NOW THEN AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO HAVE MULTIPLE POINTS OF COLLECTION AND- THAT WILL BECOME MOREADMINISTRATIVELY. THE REQUIREMENTS FOR COLLECTING OVER THERE WILL BE A LITTLE BIT HIGHER PERHAPS WHEN YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW- BUT THAT WOULD HELP. OKAY ISSUES BUT I THINK I'M GONNA THE ISSUE- I- MISTER FINANCIAL- DIDN'T JUST HELP WITH THE WHO THE DISTRICTS WE HAVE HAD CHALLENGE WITH- PERSISTENT. AND ISSUES BY COULD HAVE BEEN CHANGED A LOT AFTER THAT WORK FIFTEEN IN WROTE ONE YOU USE THE VIDEO ONLY SEEING IS A KIND OF AND OF STUDENTS IN OUR SYSTEM. OKAY THANK YOU SO MAYBE A- DIRECTIVE YOU IS IF YOU COULD- WHY IF YOU COULD GIVE US MORE FOR ABOUT THAT NOW. EIGHTIES POLICY TO IN WHAT THE ISSUES BEHIND OR AND HAPPENED BUT I. THINK ABOUT ANY RECOMMENDATIONS YOU MAY WANT TO GIVE US RELATED TO- THE- ACTUAL ADA AND ROMAN GOING FORWARD SELF YOU CAN COME BACKTO US IN THE FUTURE. THEN I WANTED TO ASK I KNOW FIRST WHAT WE'RE TALKING A LOT ABOUT DISTRICTS AND FINANCES BUT I DON'T WANNA LOSE TRACK ON. TRACK AT WHAT THIS MEANS TO OUR- SO. NO KIDS IN OUR SCHOOLS. IN WHAT THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC AND- YOU KNOW AS MR O'DONNELL TALK ABOUT. I HAVE HERE AND I'M CERTAIN THE SPOT BONTA AS WELL WE HAVE KIDS WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THIS- SOME KIDS ARE DOING. BETTER THAN OTHERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA SO. WE KNOW WE KNOW THIS AND WE HEAR FROM OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SO WE DID. PUT A LOT OF MONEY TWO YEARS AGO. INTO A LEARNING LOS BLOCK GRANT TO HELP THESE STUDENTS WHETHER IT'S- GETTING OVER THIS IN SEVERAL MONTHS OR MAYBE SEVERAL YEARS FOR SUN. KIDS TO REALLY- BOUNCE BACK. AND SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BARRIERS IN ALL THIS MASSIVE AMOUNT OF ONE TIME MONEY WE'VE GIVEN TO DISTRICTS FOR EXAMPLE WE HEAR A LOT THAT DISTRICTS CAN'T USE ONE TIME MONEY FOR ONGOING PERSONNEL IS NOT GOOD BUDGETING TO HIRE PEOPLE WHEN YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE PEOPLE YOU'RE TWO DOWN THE ROAD. BUT IF WE'RE TALKING CPAS DOT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT LIKE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES- WHAT BARRIERS ARE THERE TO HAVE A DISTRICT LET'S SAY CONTRACT WITH SUTTER HEALTH OR KAISER SOME MENTAL HEALTH PRACTITIONER TO COME IN AND DO WORK FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AS OPPOSED TO HIRING MORE INDIVIDUALS- I I'M NOT SURE THAT WERE. THAT WERE REALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF. THEIR REVENUES THAT WE PUT ON THE TABLE FOR DISTRICTS TO DO THE WORK THAT WE WANTED TO DO TO MOST IMPORTANTLY. MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR KIDS. YES I THINK THAT OTHER IMPORTANT BECAUSE I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THAT THAT IS NOT. A BIG ISSUE OVERALL WHEN YOU SEE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING IN THE SYSTEM THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF MONEY A LOT OF IT IS ONE TIME FUNDING. I THINK I WOULD NOTE THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDING IN PARTICULAR IS HAS A THREE YEAR. WINDOW FOR SPENDING SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT DISTRICTS WITH A GUY THIS IS NOT WHICH ONE TIME FUNDING THAT'S NOT WE'RE GONNA USE ALL THIS MONEY IN ONE PARTICULAR YEAR WE WANT TO. SPREAD IT OUT TO THE DEGREE POSSIBLE. I'M M. I THINK YOU KNOW WE PUT A CLEAR PATH YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THOSE ARE THE COMPANY BE PROVIDED. A LOT OF STUDENTS WEREN'T EVEN IN THE CLASSROOM SO IT MAKES SENSE FOR YOU. FOR EXAMPLE. WE'RE GOING TO DEVELOP A LONG TERM PLAN FOR HOW TO. USE THAT FUNDING I THINK THE ISSUE THAT YOU KNOW YOU READING- ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY ABOUT HOW TO SPEND ONE TIME FUNDING OF THE CHALLENGING ONE THAT WE'VE GOT THAT TYPICALLY ABOUT THE GUIDANCE THE BEST PRACTICES DO NOT USE- ONE TIME FUNDING FOR. AMONG WORK PURPOSES DO NOT USE IT TO HIR. NEW STAFF- AND THAT DAVID DEFINITELY AN ISSUE WHERE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO EITHER WHAT HAPPENED EXPIRES YOU STOCK WHICH- MEANS THAT YOU HAVE A DECLINE IN YOUR PROGRAM AND- YOU MIGHT WANT TO. MAINTAIN THE STAFF FROM OVER THE LONG RUN TO ADDRESS ISSUES OR YOU CONTINUE TO KEEP THAT STAFF ARE ON AND YOU HAVE TO SCHOOL JONES IS THE RESULT. WITH THE VOLUME OF FEDERAL FUNDING AVAILABLE I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT DISTRICTS ARE FINDING TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES AND OTHER ONE TIME WE WRITE CONCRETE PIER ONE TIME ACTIVITY THAT CAN BE SPENT WITH ALL THE FEDERAL FUNDING. REALISTICALLY IF YOU WANT THEM TO DO TO HELP THEIR KIDS THEY'RE NEEDING TO HIRE- STOP OR THE NEED TO CONTRACT OUT WITH OTHERS SO THAT THE DOCTOR CHANDRA DILEMMA THAT THEY'RE FACING RIGHT NOW. I'M WE ARE IN OUR FISCAL OUTLOOK- A REPORT THAT WE PUT OUT WE DID MAKE A NUMBER OF SUGGESTIONS FOR WHAT THE LIST THAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK ABOUT MOVING FORWARD. ONE THING THAT WE THOUGHT WE. SUGGESTED IS- NEXT YEAR GIVE THE AMOUNT OF I JUST. ON WHAT. TO BUILD TO START SOME OF THAT. FIVE IS. AN OP. TO YOUPROPERTY THAT. ON IF DISTRICTS IF YOU WANT DISTRICTS TO SORT OF WRAP THESE PROGRAM. A FELLOW. AFTER THAT THEY- WILL FALL OFF A CLIFF IN THEIR FIRST. RUNS YOU COULD SAVE SOME OF THAT FOR TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIFTH. WHEN THAT FEDERAL- WILL HAVE EXPIRED THAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE USED TO HELP THAT. THAT MIGHT- DISTRICTS MORE CALM. THAT THEY SPEND SOME MONEY ON. IN THE BE. R. SOME FUN THERE. TO HELP. SORTS OFTEN APPLY. MEAN THEY WOULD BE ABLE ROUTE DOT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS A LOT OF MONEY IN THE SYSTEM WOULD PROBABLY MCCARTY. WILL MAINTAIN THAT. LARGE AMOUNT OF LEVELS. RUBBER MOVING FORWARD BUT- THAT THERE IS A WAY TO RAMP DOWN WITHOUT IT HAVING A- NEGATIVE. TO SCHOOL SACRAMENTO. MCCARTY OKAY. ABSOLUTELY SURE. AS WELL FOR YOUR- CARD. I YOUR ABSOLUTE CORRECT ARE NORMAL MESSAGE WHEN WE TRYOUR LOCAL LEADERS IT YOU DON'T YOU ONE TIME MONEY ON STAFF BECAUSE IT ULTIMATELY ON HOW YOU NOT GONNA BUT WHAT TO DO IT'S HOW FOR THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF THAT TAX NOT HONEST WITH REGARD YOU A PANDEMIC WE FUNDING- SPECIFIC AROUND LOSS MITIGATION LITIGATION SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING AND SUPPORT OUR BELIEF- BECAUSE WE DO- WE DO SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON NON FISCAL MATTERS AS WELL IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUT OUR BELIEF IS THAT YOU ABSOLUTELY NEED PEOPLE TO DELIVER SUPPORT. OFFICE STUDENTS THAT'S HOW WE MOST EFFECTIVELY THE RIVER THAT THAT THAT SUPPORT AND SO OUR ADVICE TO DISTRICTS USED TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOUR EXIT WILLIAMS- I'M NOT NOT DON'T USE THAT ONE MILLION PEOPLE WHAT WORK WEEK WEEK GUIDED AND THE FACT DO THAT BUT WHAT IS YOUR EXIT PLAN TWO YEARS THREE YEARS IS A GOOD POINT OUT THE YOU KNOW WHAT. SHE SAYS AND RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT MOST OF THE STATE FUNDING ON A LONG TRIP. SHE'S WELL ANSWER. YEAH SPOKE AFTER. YEAH THANKS PLAYING KNOW. BE. WILL BE CLEAR IN ORDER TO LOCAL FOR EXCEPT FOR IT DOES NOT MISTER NEED THAT YOU'RE GOING TO LIMON THE PRO YOU JUST. OKAY LAS VEGAS AND SO MUCH MORE IT MAY BE DOES YOUR BEST PROGRAM ARE SO YOU'RE AT PLAN MAY BE A PREVIOUS FOR. R. YEAH ARE THAT YOU'D BE TO TOLLCROSS FOR OUT SOME TYPE OF SAN AND UP FOR OUR PHONE IN THE WE BEEN DOING AND ONE NOT THE ONLY ONES MESSAGES THAT WAY WITHIN. WE COULDN'T GET- TO ME THEM TO USE THAT- IT'S STAFF THAT OTHERWISE WOULD LEAVE BECAUSE OF DECLINING ENROLLMENT DIRECT HATE MAP VERY QUALIFIED STAFF. TO NOW. SERVE IN OTHER ROLES.

PLEASE STAY ON TOPIC. I DO THAT I JUST LET ME KNOW IF YOU WANT ME TO GO TO THAT NEXT QUESTION. SO BUT I'LL DEFINITELY CUT AMOUNTS OF TO GET OUT OF CONTROL TODAY WILL COME FROM ONE THIRTY NINE. PLEASE GO AHEAD THIRTY NINE. THE NINE YEAR OPEN. OKAY HI SORRY I'M MY NAME IS CHRISTINE KRAUS I'M AN ADMINISTRATOR AND CO FOUNDER OF OUR CHARTER ACADMY LOCATED IN TIMBRE TO DINO. AND WE DID BY LIKE YOU KNOW THAT OUR SCHOOL IS A BIT STRUGGLING WHEN IT COMES TO MAINTAINING SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS DO THAT- COMING BACK FROM COBIT THIS YEAR OUR ATTENDANCE IS TRACKING ATTENDANCE ABOUT 324% LOWER THAN OUR AVERAGE ALONG WITH- A DROPPING ABOUT TWENTY TO THIRTY EIGHTY EIGHT- AND SO WE'RE JUST ASKING THAT YOU CONSIDER CHARTER SCHOOLS TO NOT- WE'RE BASICALLY WE'RE NOT HELD HARMLESS FOR THIS. HIGHLY UNPREDICTABLE ADA LOST. AND SO WE'RE ASKING. THAT- YOU GUYS CONSIDER SCHOOLS TO BE A PART OF RECEIVING THAT ONE YOUR PROTECTION LIKE DISTRICTS DO WHEN IT COMES TO EIGHTY EIGHT DECLINE. THANK YOU. DURING A SCHOLAR. YOU ARE LINE THIRTY SORROWS MUTED THERE FOR SECOND LINE THIRTY SEVEN YOUR OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THEY'RE NOT THE REPUBLIC ADVOCATES IT IMPLEMENTED WHILE THE THREE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN COMMUNITY SCHOOLS WILL HAVE PROFOUND SHORT AND LONG TERM IMPACT THAT ADDRESS MANY OF THE CONCERNS DISCUSSED TODAY. CREATING COMMUNITY SCHOOLS IS ABOUT MORE THAN EXPANDING SERVICES IS ABOUT CULTIVATING A RACIALLY JACK CULTURALLY SUSTAINING RELATIONSHIPS CENTERED EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT BUILDS ON THE STRENGTHS AND ADDS THAT THE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES. WHERE THEY ARE LEADERS IN SHARED DECISION MAKING WITH EDUCATORS ADMINISTRATORS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS. COMMUNITY SCHOOL CAN EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM AND ACCELERATE LEARNING RECOVERY IN STUDENT ENGAGEMENT THE STATE TO PROHIBIT THE USE A COMMUNITY SCHOOL RESOURCES FOR SCHOOL HARDENING PRACTICES LIKE HARSH DISCIPLINE SUSPENSION AND EXPULSION BUT HARM STUDENTS UNLIMITED SHE'D SPENT. AND INSTEAD PRIORITIZE RELATIONSHIPS AND WELL BEING SUCH AS IMPLEMENTING RESTORATIVE PRACTICES. A POSITIVE SCHOOL CLIMATE CREATES THE CONDITIONS FOR LEARNING BUT ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO ACADEMIC SUCCESS. LASTLY TO INCREASE STAFFING CAPACITY ON CAMPUSES COMMUNITY FLUSHING HIGHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS INCLUDING PARENTS AND COMMUNITY SCHOOL COORDINATOR AND SUPPORT TEACHER RESIDENCIES AND GREGOR ON PATHWAYS FOR STUDENTS FAMILIES. CLASSIFIED AN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM STAFF TO BECOME THE DIVERS PREPARED EDUCATORS WE NEED THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO OUR NEXT CALLER. THANK YOU NEXT WEEK GOING TO GO. ONE FOR YOUR- PLEASE GO AHEAD. FORTY NINE FORTY CAN YOU HARRIS. YES HI THIS IS KRISTIN BROWN THE CFT UNION OF EDUCATORS IN CLASS BUT PROFESSIONALS THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR YOUR COMMENTS TODAY- WE ARE EXTREMELY IN SUPPORT OF LOOKING INTO ENROLLMENT BASED FUNDING FOR THE NEAR AND LONG TERM TO HELP RAISE THE- LEVEL OF FUNDING TO RAISE ALL SHIPS IN OUR STATE. BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WE MUST INCENTIVIZE OUR FUNDING TOWARDS ENDING OUR STAFFING CRISIS HAVING ADEQUATE STAFF CAN HELP WITH SMALLER COBIT COHORTS- PROVIDE THE SPECIAL ATTENTION THAT PRESIDENT BIRMINGHAM AND WAS SPEAKING TO AND HELP PREVENT SOME OF THE TRIP BURNOUT THAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. SO TERROR DONALD BASE INCREASES ARE SOMETHING THAT THIS VEHICLE IS- INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE OF MENTORSHIP AND BONUSES ARE HELPFUL BUT WE NEED TO MAKE THE EDUCATION PROFESSION- INDUSTRY MORE DESIRABLE SO WE HOPE THAT WE CAN FOCUS ON THAT IN THE BUDGET TO COME. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR. NEXT WE ARE GOING TO GO TO LINE THIRTY FOR YOUR OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THERE MY NAME'S JAMIE AND I'M CALLING IN FROM THIS TEN STATE ASSEMBLY DISTRICT I AM A MOM OF TWO KIDS A SOLE PROPRIETOR TO BUSINESSES. AND I'M JOINED HERE ON THIS CALL WITH MY FIFTH GRADER TODAY THIS IS OUR CIVICS CLASS WHICH SO THE THING I'M CALLING ABOUT IS THE PARENT'S PERSPECTIVE ON THE ISSUE OF ENROLLMENT. MEANING THAT WE ARE ONE OF THOSE FAMILIES WHO DECIDED TO DESCEND ROLE FROM SCHOOLING AND GOING INTO HOME SCHOOLING THIS YEAR SO I JUST I APPRECIATE THAT THERE'S SOME LOOKING OUT WHY ARE PARENTS DECIDING TO PULL THEIR KIDS OUT AND EDUCATING THEM AT HOME I'M SEEING A SIGNIFICANT RISE IN MY COMMUNITY. I HAVE PARENTS THAT ARE JOINING ME IN THIS ENDEAVOR AND I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY GOOD SHAPE ACTUALLY ASK SOME OF THE PARENTS WHY THEY'RE CHOOSING NOT TO SEND THEIR KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL. AND CREATE A HOMESCHOOLING ENVIRONMENT INSTEAD I AM SEEING IT GROWING- IN MY COMMUNITY LIKE I SAID AND I'VE BEEN HOME SCHOOLING SINCE AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY ONE MY KIDS ARE IN FIFTH AND SEVENTH GRADE. AND PRIOR TO LAST SCHOOL YEAR I'VE NEVER PLAN TO HOME SCHOOL MY KIDS BUT DUE TO- THE MASKING REQUIREMENTS THAT VACCINE MANDATES AND MY MEANT THE MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS I DECIDED TO BRING MY KIDS HOME TO SCHOOL AS WAS MENTIONED BEFORE I FEEL LIKE THERE WASN'T A POSITIVE CONDITIONS FOR SENDING THEM TO SCHOOL- AND SO EVEN THOUGH I RUN TWO BUSINESSES I FELT LIKE I CAN PROVIDE MORE. OF THE POSITIVE CONDITIONS FOR LEARNING BETTER AT HOME- THE REASON BEING FOR THIS IS AT SCHOOL SO MUCH WAS LOCKED DOWN CANCELED FIELD TRIPS CANCEL COMMUNITY EVENTS CANCELLED STILL. PLAYS MUSIC PERFORMANCES THE LIMITATIONS ON SPORTS AND ALL OF THAT AT HOME I AM ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW- SHE EVEN WITHOUT A MASK ON FIELD TRIPS AND EXPERIENCE- PLAY GROUPS AND ALL OF THAT KIND OF STUFF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS BEEN REQUIRING. STUDENTS TO MASK. AT ALL TIMES EVEN OUTDOORS DURING SHE E. WHEN THEY WERE GLASS. ON THE TRACK PLEASE SOME NEED INCLUDES CAN PLACE. WAIT A MATH. THANK YOUNG SHORT I AM. WE'LL GO TO THE NAY OUR QUESTION ARE IN NEXT COM AND- ONE THIRTY TO YOUR OPEN. YOU TO PLEASE GO AHEAD. THIRTY TWO ONE MORE CHANCE- WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE YOUR COMMENT. THIS MAY TARA TOLD NINE THIRTY TWO. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD OKAY GIVE ME THE WRONG NUMBER SORRY ABOUT THAT- GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRS MEMBERS JOHN WHEN YOU'RE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU OF HER TODAY CO THAT CONTINUES TO HAPPEN AN UNEXPECTED UNPREDICTABLE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE ACROSS THE STATE. BACK IN JUNE WE ALL HOPE THAT THE SCHOOLS WOULD EXPERIENCE A MUCH MORE NORMAL YEAR BUT THE FACT IS THAT MOST DELEGATES ARE STRUGGLING WITH LOWER THAN EXPECTED EIGHTY EIGHT DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES LARGELY BEYOND THEIR CONTROL OUR PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE FACING THE SAME DIFFICULT CHALLENGES THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE HOWEVER UNLIKE TRADITIONAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE NOT HELD HARMLESS. FOR THIS HIGHLY UNPREDICTABLE EIGHTY EIGHT LOST A SIGNIFICANT DISPARITY IN THE LAW FUNDS CHARTER SCHOOLS BASED ONLY ON THEIR CURRENT ACTUAL ADA- WHERE DISTRICTS ARE PROTECTED FROM DECLINE IN THE CURRENT YEAR- PROTECTIONS ARE CRITICAL SO THAT ALL SCHOOLS MAY HAVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL OF SERVICE THROUGH THIS UNCERTAIN TIME IN THE STABILITY TO MAINTAIN THOSE SERVICES WHEN OPERATIONS STABILIZE. THIS INEQUITY IN THE LAW MUST BE ADDRESSED WE THEREFORE REQUEST THE CHARGE WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE SAME EIGHTY A LOST PROTECTIONS THAT ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS CURRENTLY RECEIVE DURING SOME. PRESIDENT TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU. NINE FIFTY YOUR- ASSEMBLY MEMBERS COUNTY TO CARE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION- I JUST WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET AS GOING FORWARD WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY TO BUDGET AND GIVEN THAT EDUCATION GROUPS ARE CURRENTLY PLAYING CATCH UP. REGARDING THE FOR. SIX BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS ALLOCATED TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY FOR THE YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER GOING FORWARD WITH ANY PROJECTED BUDGET SURPLUS DESIGNATED FOR STUDENT BEHAVIORAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH PROGRAMS. HOW TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S A MUCH MORE COLLABORATION COOPERATION AND A COKE HERE AND GO HE SAID PLAN FOR SPENDING THAT MONEY THAT HAS ALL THE WORK GROUP MEMBERS.

IS BAD TEACHERS NEED TO HAVE ACTING CHOICE SECOND COVERED NINETEEN VACCINE MANDATES TO ATTEND. IN PERSON K. TO TWELVE. PUBLIKUM SCHOOL WITHOUT EXEMPTION IS THE BILL WE NEED TO KEEP THE PERSONABLE BECAUSE FOR ALL VACCINES SEARCH HPV A MENINGITIS VACCINE MANDATES AND HAND. IN PERSON PUBLIC OR PRIVATE HIGH SCHOOL. WITHOUT A EXEMPTIONS IS A DANGEROUS BILL FOR ALLOWING TWELVE AN OVER MINERS TO CONSENT TO RECEIVE ACTED WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT HORRIBLE IDEA FOR MANY REASONS OKAY WHAT PROJECTS ADVOCACY OF SEVERAL GOOD BILLS WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO GET OFF THEIR FIRST RELIGIOUS CONSCIENTIOUS BELIEF EXEMPTIONS BILL ADLER JUST CONSCIENTIOUSLY CONVENTION- ALL THAT CLEAN PLACE DEVELOP BAD.

YEAH THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON- MY NAME IS JENSEN GRASS I'M- IN THE MINISTRY WITH IDA HIGH SCHOOL LOCATED IN LONG BEACH- WE'RE A HIGH PERFORMING CHARTER SCHOOL AND OUR STUDENTS ARE PERFORMS OUTPERFORMED LOCAL STATE AND NATIONAL AVERAGES ON EVERY TESTINGS ARE OPENING WE'VE DONE THAT WHILE SERVING A LONG BECAUSE MOST CHALLENGING BY A COMMUNITY. DESPITE THE FACT THAT- THE ATM AND ROMAN CHALLENGES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT SMALLER CHARTER SCHOOLS LIKE OURS PARTICULARLY HARD- FOR THREE REASONS ONE- WE'RE NOT LARGE AND TO OFFER INDEPENDENT STUDY IN THE DISTANCE LEARNING. THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY ARE OFFERED BY SOME OF THE LARGER DISTRICTS. THAT'S RESULTED BUT NOW THE MEDIA AT SIX PERCENT- HITS ARMAMENT DAVE FROM DAY ONE. AND THEN ARE YOU GOING TO WE HAVE- WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFFING TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE NEW INDEPENDENT STUDY REQUIREMENTS SPECIALLY FOR THE LONG TERM INDEPENDENT STUDY. I THINK THE ONE STUDENTS GOING TO QUARANTINE FOR WHATEVER REASON- THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL WE CALCULATED BY PERCENT. LOCK YEAH- AND SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT ARMS. TOTAL FROM EIGHTY EIGHT PRE CAN. HERE NOW WHEN YOU INCLUDE WE CAN'T DO THAT OUTRAGE THAT WOULD NORMALLY HAPPEN WE HAVE FALLEN- 20% IN TWO YEARS SO NOT THE 22% NOT THE APPEALING BUT THE TWENTY FIRST. THANK YOU SO. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN HE- HELD HARMLESS JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU TO OUR NEXT CALLER. GOOD AFTERNOON NICOLE BORNEMANN ON BEHALF OF THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH CENTERS ARE INTEGRAL TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. IN PARTICULAR PREVENTION AND EARLY IN FOR INTERVENTION OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING STUDENT SUCCESS. STUDENTS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING SOCIO EMOTIONAL BEHAVIORAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. WILL STRUGGLE TO ENGAGE WITH THE CURRICLUM AND MAINTAIN POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEERS AND ADULTS. IN SEVERAL STUDIES RESEARCHERS AND RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS SUCH AS DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY ARE RELATED TO SCHOOL IMPORTANT BEHAVIORS INCLUDING CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM AND CHILDREN REFUSING TO ATTEND SCHOOL. THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN BOTH THE CHILDREN AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE AND THE COMMUNITY SCHOOLS INITIATIVE WHICH SHOULD PROVIDE SCHOOLS THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO BUILD THEIR OWN CAPACITY TO SERVE STUDENTS WITH THE CLINICAL AND NON CLINICAL RESOURCES. THEY NEED TO LEARN AND CONTRIBUTE TO A POSITIVE SCHOOL CLIMATE WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR APPROVING S. B. TWO TWENTY FOUR THIS YEAR ENSURING THAT HEALTH EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS IN CALIFORNIA'S THANK YOU MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS CONTAIN INFORMATION. THANK YOU. THANKS MUCH FINE THIRTY PLEASE GO AHEAD. YES HELLO MY NAME IS TONY GOING OUT EVERY SUPER KIND OF INSPIRE PUBLIC SCHOOL IN THE CENTRAL MODESTO MCCARTY MCCONNELL AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANKS FOR LETTING ADDRESS YOU. J. AFFECT THE- FINDS. ABOUT FISCAL CLIFF- BEING PAID BY PUBLIC SCHOOLS ADDED HIGHLIGHT THAT THAT. PUBLICLY FUNDED INDEPENDENT CHARTERS ALREADY BEEN PUSHED OFF THAT CLIFF. UNLIKE A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE NOT PRESENTLY HELD HARMLESS FOR EIGHTY LAW. AND SO THE DISPARITY AS ALREADY BEGUN. WE CURRENTLY ARE 5210% BELOW IN OR ABA AS WELL AS LOWER IN ENROLLMENT AND WE'VE EXPERIENCED SIMILAR. LOSSES THERE WHICH IS GOING DIRECTLY TO OUR BOTTOM LINE CURRENTLY. BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE PREDICTABLE FUNDING IS ESSENTIAL FOR US TO PROVIDE HIGH LEVELS OF SERVICE IN THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING AND SOME OF THE OTHER INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS THAT DR- GUN CANNON MENTIONED. IS SOMETHING THAT ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS DESERVE AND SO WHAT WE ASK IS THAT WE UTILIZE THE HOLD HARMLESS AND ADDRESS THIS INEQUITY IN THE LAW. AND MAKE SURE THAT PUBLICLY FUNDED CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE EQUALLY HELD HARMLESS. I APPRECIATE A LOT OF THE SOLUTION HERE TODAY AND I HOPE THAT. PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE CONSIDERED- FOR A DATA POINT YOU CAN CONSIDER. 710% IS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER SCHOOL WHICH WOULD EQUATE TO ABOUT THREE TO FOUR FULL TIME EMPLOYEES THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO OUR NEXT CALLJUST TO CLARIFY- THAT'S NOT CO ALMOST. WAS IT TO DIFFERENT PEOPLE. RETURNERS CALLER PLEASE MY APOLOGIES THERE I FIND THIS ONE. BROKE IT.

FORTY TWO GOING BACK. HI THIS IS ROBERT MEMORIES FROM CHILDREN NOW- I WANTED TO TALK JUST BRIEFLY ABOUT THE UPSIDE OF DECLINING ENROLLMENT. AND THAT'S MAINLY THAT WITH PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BEING A TRICKS TOPIC GROUPS WITH THE GENERAL FUND AND LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES. AS WE HAVE DECLINING ENROLLMENT THAT MEANS THERE'S MORE MONEY AVAILABLE TO INVEST IN THE KIDS THAT ARE THERE. THAT MEANS THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME WE'RE SEEING ACCELERATION IN THE GROWTH IN PER PUPIL SPENDING. AND NOW WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MONEY IS USED TO SUPPORT- BETTER STAFFING RATIOS WE'VE HAD SOME OF THE WORST STAFFING RATIOS IN THE NATION. THIS OUR OPPORTUNITY IMPROVE THAT. IN PARTICULAR WE LIKE THIS MAKE SURE THAT THE THAT THAT SAVINGS- WHICH WILL BE UP TO ME TO BE AROUND SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT DECADE. IS USED TO SUPPORT BETTER STAFFING LEVELS AT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS SCHOOLS WE THINK YOU CAN BUILD ON. LINE YEAH- THE LAST BUDGET ACTION THAT INVESTED IN OUR IN STOPPING THE WILL TO BE SCHOOLS. AND ENSURE THAT TE KIDS WHO NEED IT MOST GET THE ATTENTION THAT THEY DESERVE- ONE OTHER AREA A RECOMMENDATION IS GIVING DISTRICTS GREATER FLEXIBILITY WITH. THEIR RESERVE REQUIREMENTS IN CARRYING MONEY OVER FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT WITH FORTY BILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME MONEY FLOATING AROUND IN THE SYSTEM. PROVIDING SOME FLEXIBILITY TO MOVE THAT MONEY ACROSS YEARS. WOULD ALLOW DISTRICTS TO USE THOSE FUNDS TO HIRE STAFF THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU AND I LISTEN I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT STAFFING LEVEL REALLY TO ME THAT MEANS CLASS SIZES. ARE CLASS SIZES ARE WAY TOO LARGE IN THIS STATE- THEY'RE STARTING TO COME DOWN A BIT- AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE MAGICAL. MORE MAGICAL CHANGE IN A CLASS AND THEN I HAVE A SMALLER CLASS SIZE IT JUST CREATES A MUCH MORE POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT. FOR STUDENT HEALTH AS WELL AS STUDENT ACADEMICS. SO WITH THAT TO OUR NEXT CALLER PLEASE. THANKS MUCH BETTER. ANNEX WE'RE GONNA GO LINE FOR SIX YOU ARE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ALLOW US TO SPEAK I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT AS A PARENT AND MY PERSPECTIVE IS THAT I'VE TAKEN OUT MY- THREE STUDENTS AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT. DUE TO IT ALL BEGAN WITH COLIN AND I ALSO REALIZED AS ANOTHER PARENT CALLER SAID THAT I CAN PROVIDE A HIGHER QUALITY EDUCATION. AND MY CHILDREN DON'T HAVE TO BE MASS MY CHILDREN DON'T HAVE TO. AND YOUR THIS TRAUMA THAT WE CALL THE PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I'M GLAD YOU GUYS ARE REVIEWING THE BUDGET- IF THE BUDGET INCLUDES- EMOTIONAL SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BECAUSE THAT'S HIGHLY NEEDED TO KOBE. THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I TOOK MY CHILDREN OUT BECAUSE THE CODE MANDATES AFFECTED THEIR MENTAL HEALTH THAT SIGNIFICANTLY. AND THAT'S IT THAT'S MY COMMENT THANK YOU AGAIN HAVE A GOOD ONE ARE THERE ANY MORE COLORS.

WONDERFULLY STICK TO THE TOPIC AT HAND. MARK ABSTAINED CALIFORNIAN FIREMEN OF TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION NETWORK- IS THAT ONE AS FAR AS WITH THE NEW FUNDING THAT IS AT LEAST ONE TIME FUNDING MAKE A RECOMMENDATION ABOUT SEVEN YEARS AGO I STARTED RECOMMENDING TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THAT THAT- DID TO DEVELOP LIBRARIES OF- VIDEO LESSONS ACROSS AS FAR LESSONS ACROSS THE CURRICULUM AND I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD BE ADVANTAGEOUS IN THE ONE TIME FUNDING IS PROVIDED GRANTS TO DISTRICTS TO CREATE LIBRARY OF- LICENSED VIDEO TO BE ACCESSED INTO A YOUTUBE CHANNEL BY THE DISTRICTS THIS HAS THE ADVANTAGE THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT STUDENTS THAT HAVE MULTIPLE DAY- ABSENCES CAN ACCESS AND IT HAS SECOND BENEFIT AS FAR AS HAVING A STUDENTS WHO DON'T GET SOMETHING IN THE CLASSROOM AS FAR AS- REMEDIAL INSTRUCTION THAT THEY CAN ACCESS THOSE LESSONS AND BE ABLE TO. STOP AND REWIND OF THINGS THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND ALSO AS FAR AS BEING HERE- ON THIS HEARING TODAY A LOT OF- ATTENTION WAS PLACED AS FAR AS ON THE ATTENDANCE OF STUDENTS IN SEATS AND TIME AND THAT WAS ALSO DEFICIENCY IN JUNE THE DISTANCE LEARNING WELL WE NEED TO DO IS LOOK AS FAR AS LEARNING ENGAGEMENT AND LOOKING AT A LARGER VARIETY OF HOW WE PROVIDE LEARNING ENGAGING FOR THE STUDENTS THANKS.

ONE IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK YOU MAY PROCEED ONE MINUTE PLEASE THANK YOU THANK YOU MY NAME IS NICOLE YANG I AM TO PLASTER COUNTY CHAPTER CHAIR OF MOMS FOR LIBERTY. WE HAVE SIX CHAPTERS IN CALIFORNIA AND WE ARE GROWING EVERY DAY OUR MAIN FOCUS AND MISSION RIGHT NOW. IS TO HELP FAMILIES UNENROLLED FROM THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM AS IT IS FAILING THEM WE ARE SETTING UP HOME SCHOOL PODS AND EVEN HAVE HAD MEMBERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE CREATE THEIR OWN SCHOOLS FREE OF GOVERNMENT INTRUSION. THE MANDATES THAT THESE HIGH AND LEGISLATORS ARE PASSING RIGHT NOW ARE CUTTING ENROLLMENT LOSS. SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE ENROLLMENT CLIFF NOT HAPPEN AN ENROLLMENT CLIFF NOT HAPPEN YOU WILL WALK BACK SOME OF THESE POLICIES. SUCH AS THE VACCINE MANDATE AND PLASTER COUNTY WE STAND TO LOSE A THIRD OF OUR TEACHERS AND ABOUT 20% OF OUR STUDENTS. THAT WILL DRASTICALLY AFFECT FUNDING AND THAT WILL DRASTICALLY AFFECT THE- LEVEL OF SCHOOLING THESE CHILDREN ARE GETTING. THANK YOU THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS SARAH AND I'M FROM CONTRA COSTA COUNTY I'M GONNA READ- I'VE BEEN KIND OF SURPRISED THAT NOBODY'S TALKING ABOUT THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM WHICH IS THE REASON FOR THE LACK OF ENROLLMENT. AND THAT IS THE VACCINE MANDATES FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TEACHER CRISIS. AND A LOSS OF ENROLLMENT AND IT'S REALLY JUST THAT SIMPLE- I JUST BEEN SURPRISE BECAUSE I'VE BEEN HEARING. DISCUSSION ABOUT SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL ISSUES AND MENTAL HEALTH ASPECTS AND ALL THAT BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD A SINGLE ONE OF THE EXPERTS. ADDRESS THE ACTUAL REASON NOT EVEN THE OAKLAND SUPERINTENDENT I MEAN IT'S KIND UNDERSTOOD THAT THE BLACK POPULATION IT'S LIKE NATIONWIDE A REFUSING TO BE VACCINATED AND SHOOTING BROACH THAT SUBJECT WHEN IT CAME TO HER KIDS. SO IT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME SO I'M HOPING THAT YOU GUYS HAVE.
