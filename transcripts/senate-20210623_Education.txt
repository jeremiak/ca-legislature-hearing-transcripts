B. NINETY TWO. ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAAS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. THERE PRESENT TO YOU AB NINETY TWO WHICH WILL CREATE AN EQUITABLE SLIDING SCALE FOR FAMILY FEES FOR CHILD CARE AND WILL ALLEVIATE THE BURDEN ON WORKING FAMILIES STRUGGLING TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES. CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE STATES FIRST PICK FOR PARENTS WHO NEED CHILD CARE SERVICES. WELL THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STATE AND FEDERALLY FUNDED PROGRAMS THAT HELP FAMILIES PAY FOR CHILD CARE. FAMILIES WHO NEED CARE MUST STILL PAY WHAT IS CALLED FAMILY FEES. THESE FEES GROW AS INCOME RISES AND CAN BE UP TO FOUR SIX HUNDRED FORTY FIVE DOLLARS PER MONTH. WHICH IS NOT AFFORDABLE FOR MANY WORKING FAMILIES. THE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS ONLY HEIGHTENED. THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE CHILD CARE ESPECIALLY FOR WORKING MOTHERS AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR OR A SIGNIFICANT PART OF CALIFORNIA'S ESSENTIAL WORKFORCE. AB NINETY TWO WILL ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BY CONVENING A WORKING GROUP OF PARENTS PROVIDERS AND CHILD CARE STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP AN EQUITABLE SLIDING SCALE FOR FAMILY FEES IT BETTER REFLECTS FAMILIES AND BUDGETS. THIS BILL WILL PROTECT CHILD CARE PROVIDERS BY ENSURING THEY DO NOT ABSORB THE COST OF A REDUCTION IN FAMILY TREES AND THAT THE NUMBER OF CHILD CARE SLOTS OR SPACES IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT REDUCED. FINALLY AB NINETY TWO WILL UTILIZE FEDERAL FUNDING TO TEMPORARILY WAIVE FAMILY FEES. FOR ALL FAMILIES UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY THREE TO REDUCE THE HARDSHIP OF COVERT NINETEEN ON CALIFORNIANS AND AS PERMITTED UNDER FEDERAL LAW. HERE TO TESTIFY IS MAKAYLA MODA A PARENTS PAYING HIGH FAMILY FEES FOR HER CHILD CARE AND LORI FURSTENFELD WITH A CHILD CARE LAWCENTER.

THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AB TWO THIRTY THREE SIXTEEN ASSURE THAT ALL STUDENTS APPLYING THE UNIT TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAVE A FAIR SHOT AT OF ADMISSION REGARDLESS OF THEIR WEALTH OR FAMILY CONNECTIONS WHEN YOU SEE CAMPUS STUFF WERE IMPLICATED IN THE FBI'S OPERATION VARSITY BLUES COLLEGE ADMISSIONS FRAUD INVESTIGATION THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE RESPONDED BY APPROVING AN AUDIT INTO UC ADMISSIONS PROCESS SEES. THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT SOME UC CAMPUSES STUFF EXPLOITED LOOPHOLES IN THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS TO OMIT UNDER QUALIFIED STUDENTS AS FAVORS THE STUDENTS SKEWED WEALTHY AND WHITE. APPLICANT'S CHANCES OF EMISSIONS WERE ALSO FOUND TO BE OVER DEPENDENT ON WHICH STAFF REVIEW THEIR APPLICATION. SPECIFICALLY AB TWO THIRTY THREE SIXTY ADDRESS THE INHERENT IN EQUITIES OF THE UC STUDENT ADMISSIONS PROCESS WHICH HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE STATE AUDITOR. TO SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE. CAMPUS STAFF TAKING ADVANTAGE OF WEAKNESSES IN ADMISSIONS PROCESS TO INAPPROPRIATELY AND MET STUDENTS AS FAVORS TO DONORS FAMILIES AND FRIENDS. CAMPUS IS LOCKING KEY CRITERIA AND STANDARDS TO SUPPORT THEIR ADMISSIONS DECISIONS. CAMPUSES FAILING TO ADEQUATELY ENSURE THAT REVIEWERS AND FACULTY CONSISTENTLY AND FAIRLY EVALUATE APPLICATIONS. AND THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT HAS NOT SAFEGUARDED THE UNIVERSITY'S ADMISSIONS PROCESS AB TWO THIRTY THREES ALONG WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND REQUESTSTHE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT. TO ESTABLISH POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO IMPLEMENT A FAIR AND CONSISTENT EMISSIONS PROCESS FOR ALL STUDENTS CODIFYING THESE RECOMMENDATIONS SUCH AS SUGGESTED BY THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE WILL IMPROVE ACCESS. PROVIDE CONSISTENT EMISSIONS KRITERIEN EACH CAMPUS REQUIRE REGULAR INTERNAL AUDITS ENSURE THAT EMISSIONS STAFF ARE PROPERLY TRAINED. THIS BILL IS NOT ONLY ABOUT THE WEALTHYAND WELL CONNECTED INFLUENCING EMISSIONS DECISIONS IT'S ABOUT SOME STUDENTS BEING DENIED EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO AN EDUCATION SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAD A DIFFERENT PERSON REVIEW THE APPLICATION. ANOTHER EQUALLY QUALIFIED STUDENT. THIS PRACTICE WOULD NOT BE ACCEPTABLE IN ANY INSTITUTION LET ALONE OUR TAXPAYER SUPPORTED PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY IS THAT MISTER BOB HARRIS FROM THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. TO SHARE THE AUDITORS FINDINGS RECOMMENDATIONS AND TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS BUT YOU MAY HAVE ON HOW FAR THE UC HAS COME IN IMPLEMENTING THE ORDERS REQUEST. WHAT THE GAP IS BETWEEN THAT AND WHERE WE NEED TO BE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN AND MISTERHARRIS WERE VERY EXCITED J. THINK YOU ARE FIRST TO LEAD SUPPORT OR ANYONE WHO'S HERE IN PERSON SO WELCOME YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BOB HARRISON WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND I WAS THE PROJECT MANAGER ON A REVIEW OF THE UNIVERSITY'S ADMISSIONS PRACTICES- BY WAY BACK IN OUR OFFICE DOESN'T TAKE A FORMAL. ON BUT TODAY I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT HOW AB TWO THIRTY THREE. ADOPT SEVERAL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE FOR IMPROVEMENTS WHERE WE SAW DEFICIENCIES IN THE UNIVERSITY'S ADMISSIONS PRACTICES. AND HOW THE UNIVERSITY STILL EVEN SIX MONTHS AFTER OUR AUDIT HAS BEEN COMPLETED HAS NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THOSE AREAS ON ITS OWN. NOW THE BILL DOES ADOPT SEVERAL OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IN A NUMBER OF AREAS I WANT TO FOCUS ON TO IN THE INTEREST OF TIME AND THEN TAKE QUESTIONS IF YOU HAVE THEM. THE FIRST IS IN THE% AREA OF APPLICANT ASSESSMENT SO EVERY APPLICANT IS ASSESSED BY A READER WHO REFUSE THAT APPLICATION AND SCORES IT AND THAT SCORE IS GENERALLY THE BASIS FOR WHETHER SOMEONE WILL END UP BEING COMPETITIVE FOR ADMISSION OR NOT. SIX MONTHS AFTER OUR REVIEW DOT WAS DONE THE UNIVERSITY STILL NOT IMPLEMENTED OUR RECOMMENDATION TO HAVE TWO KEY CONTROLS IN PLACE ONE. STANDARDS FOR HOW THEY KNOW THAT THEIR READERS HAVE BEEN POPERLY TRAINED WE CALL THOSE PROFICIENCY STANDARDS. THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THEIR READERS ARE. FULLY TRAINED TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW LIVE APPLICATIONS THEY DIDN'T HAVE THOSE AT THE TIME OF THE AUDIT. AND HALF OF THE CAMPUSES THAT USE READERS STILL DIDN'T HAVE THOSE PROFICIENCY STANDARDS IN PLACE AS OF APRIL OF THIS YEAR. FURTHER THEY NEED TO HAVE ONGOING MONITORING OF REACH READERS OF APPLICATIONS THROUGHOUT THE APPLICATION CYCLE TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT. STUDENTS ARE BEING TREATED FAIRLY. BUT NONE OF THE CAMPUSES THAT USE READERS AS OF APRIL HAD ADEQUATE FULLY FLESHED OUT MONITORING MECHANISMS IN PLACE. AGAIN THAT SIX MONTHS AFTER WE MET OUR RECOMMENDATION. THE SECONDARY I WANT TO COVER FOR YOU AND THEN TAKE QUESTIONS IS THE AREA OF APPLICANT SELECTION. SO ONCE APPLICATIONS ARE REVIEWED. THE UC THEN HAS TO MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS AMONGST A VERY COMPETITIVE POOL OF APPLICANTS. ABOUT WHICH- APPLICANTS GET ADMITTED AND WHICH ARE DENIED ADMISSION. AND TO DO THAT FAIRLY CONSISTENTLY AND WITH TRANSPARENCY IT REALLY NEEDS TO HAVE DOCUMENTED METHODOLOGIES FOR HOW IT'S GOING TO MAKE ITS DECISIONS. WE FOUND THE TWO CAMPUSES THE MOST SELECTIVE CAMPUSES UC BERKELEY AND UCLA. DIDN'T HAVE THOSE AT THE TIME OF OUR AUDIT. AND FURTHER IN APRIL WE FOUND SIX OF NINE CAMPUS UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES. STILL DIDN'T HAVE CLEARLY DOCUMNTED METHODOLOGIES. ABOUT HOW THEY WILL MAKE ADMITTEDLY HARD DECISIONS. TO CHOOSE BETWEEN VERY COMPETITIVE. POOLS OF APPLICANTS AND WITH THAT I'D HAVE TO BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MIGHT HAVE. MISTER HARRIS IF YOU CAN STICK AROUND THEY MAY HAVE QUESTIONS WE GET TO THAT POINT. WE WILL GO TO ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT HERE IN FORTY TWO OH THREE. SEEING NO ONE WILL GO TO ROOM TWENTY FORTY. ALSO SEEING NO ONE WE WILL GO TO THE PHONE LINES MAN MODERATORS OR ANYONE WHO ON THE LINE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB. TWO THIRTY THREE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO THIRTY THREE. PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AND THE OPERATOR WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH THE LINE NUMBER AND PLACE YOU BACK INTO Q. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWO THIRTY THREE. PRESS ONE THAN THEIR OWN NOW. MY NUMBER FORTY FOUR YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. IMMEDIACY WOULD NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AT THE TIME I'M SURE WE HAVE NO ONE I THINK YOU THINK ABOUT A MODERATOR WE WILL NOW GO TO OPPOSITION WE HAVE NO LEAD OPPOSITION LISTED IS THERE ANYONE BUT WE DO OH I'M SORRY I DIDN'T TURN MY PHONE ACTION SAYS NO LEAD OPPOSITION OKAY A LEAD OPPOSITION. YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES. PLEASE GO AHEAD. SURE I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THIS IS TYLER AYE YOU ARE ME HALF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THEN ACCOMPANIED BY UC'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS ON ME YOU AND WILL- WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AB TWO THIRTY THREE AND BEFORE ON THE MIXER REMARKS I WANT TO MENTION THAT YOU SEE IS ALREADY TAKEN SIGNIFICANT ACTION IN RESPONSE TO BOTH THE NATIONAL COLLEGE EMISSIONS SCANDAL WHICH OF COURSE AFFECTED COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND THE COUNTRY. AS WELL AS THE SUBSEQUENT CSA AUDIT FINDINGS RECOMMENDATIONS IN RESPONSE UC'S ETHICS COMPLIANCE AND AUDIT SERVICES BE INDEPENDENT- INVESTIGATIVE ARM OF YOU SEE THAT REPORTS DIRECTLY TO THE UC BOARD OF REGENTS COMPLETED A SYSTEM WIDE AUDIT OF UC ADMISSION AND AS A RESULT OF THE TO PHASE OUT IT UC CAMPUS IMPLEMENTED EXTENSIVE CHANGES ABOUT STRENGTHEN AND PROTECT. THE INTEGRITY OUR MISSIONS PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES THIS IS THIS UC PRESIDENT MICHAEL DRAKE SEND A LETTER TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OF THE NINE UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY DIRECTING THEM TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTIONS IN RESPONSE THE STATE AUDITOR'S. RECOMMENDATIONS ON YOU SEE IT AS AN- I THIS LETTER IS PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE AND IS A- IN. AS WELL. HELLO WELL INTENDED THE CONDITIONS WHINY JERRY TWO THIRTY THREE COULD HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR YOU SEE ENCOURAGE FUTURE STUDENT BODY. I WILL NOW ASK EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR YOON WOO TO SHARE SOME PERSPECTIVES ON THE IMPACT OF THIS LEGISLATION COULD HAVE ON YOU SEE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MICHIGAN WILLIAM TAYLOR IT'S ALSO. I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST STATE WITHOUT QUESTION THE UNIVERSITY SHOULD HAVE A ROBUST SYSTEM OF CONTROLS AGAINST ATTEMPTS TO INAPPROPRIATELY ILLEGALLY OR UNETHICALLY INFLUENCE THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS. ALL UC CAMPUSES HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO STRENGTHEN AND PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF ITS ADMISSIONS PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES. FOR IN THEIR SYSTEM WIDE GUIDELINES AND PROTOCOLS FOR EACH CAMPUS IDENTIFY AND RECORD THE RATIONALE FOR APPLICANTS ADMITTED. THAT MIGHT NOT MEETING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ELIGIBILITY OF THE LOUD BY THE REGION'S ADMISSION BY EXCEPTION POLICY. WE APPRECIATE THE LEGISLATURE'S ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE AND WE SHARE THE GOAL OF ENSURING A TRANSPARENT AND LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR EVERY APPLICANT. HOWEVER EASY IS CONCERNED THAT EIGHTY TWO THREE THREE COULD RESULT IN PRACTICES THAT FAVOR A LESS DIVERSE AND MORE SOCIO ECONOMICALLY ADVANTAGED GROUP OF APPLICANTS. THE COULD GAIN THEM. GIVEN THAT THEY ARE WELL RESOURCE. YOU SEE BELIEVES SPECIFICITY OF. A REQUIRED DOCUMENTS. WOULD LIKELY PROVIDE WELL RESEARCHED FAMILIES AS WELL AS THOSE IN THE COLLEGE CONSULTING BUSINESS. WITH THE SECRET FIVE HE WILL NEED TO MARKET AND SELL THEIR SERVICES TO GUARANTEE ADMISSION TO THE UC LIKELY AT A VERY HIGH COST. WHEN IN FACT THERE IS NO SUCH FIGURES ARE. MOREOVER YOU SEE IS CONCERNED THAT PRESSURE THIS PRESSURE A. B. GEN THREE THREE WORK TO BECOME LAW. WELL IN IN BURTON WE GIVE ALL OUR ADMISSION PROCESS INTO ONE THAT IS FORMULA DRIVEN RATHER THAN ONE. THAT EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE OF COMPREHENSIVE AND HOLISTIC REVIEW INCLUDING THE USE OF QUALITATIVE MEASURES OF ACHIEVEMENT. COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF WHAT MAKES YOU THINK UNIQUE IN ITS ABILITY TO ADMIT STUDENTS BEARING CHARACTERISTICS FROM ABROAD WHAT THE BACKGROUND. WE ASK THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSIDER THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION ALREADY TAKEN BY YOU SEE IN THE AREA OF ADMISSIONS I THOUGHT THE POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THE FOR LEGISLATION COULD HAVE ON YOU SEE IF IT WERE TO BE SIGNED INTO LAW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW NEW MOVED ANY LEAD OFF OR ANY OPPOSITION HERE IN FORTY TWO OH THREE. SEEING NONE WILL GO TO FORTY OR TWENTY FORTY SEEN MAN WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE PHONE LINES MATTER MODERATED WITH ANYBODY ON THE PHONE LINES WHO WISHES TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWO THIRTY THREE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF EIGHTY TWO THIRTY THREE. PRESS ONE ZERO. OPERATOR WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR LINE NUMBER AND PLACE BACK IN THE QUEUE. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWO THIRTY THREE. PRESS ONE THEN ZERO NOW. AND AT THE TIME ADAM HERE WE HAVE NO MONEY Q. THANK MADAM MODERATOR WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE TO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU SIR VERY MUCH- AND- APPRECIATE THE- TESTIMONY FROM BOTH THE- AUTHOR AND ALSO DIVERSITY CALIFORNIANS KNOW FRANKLY I WAS FACULTY MEMBER YOU THAT YOU SEE AND- WHAT WAS INVOLVED IN UNDERGRADUATE ADMISSIONS- WAS INVOLVED IN OTHER FORMS OF ADMISSIONS. AS WELL SO I AM VERY SENSITIVE TO WHAT THE- UC TESTIFIED TO YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO TRY TO CREATE A DIVERSE CLASS- YOU ACTUALLY. ACTUALLY KIND OF PUT THE CLASS TOGETHER EIGHT SO YOU DON'T EVERYONE TO LOOK THE SAME- AS WELL BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS A LOOK AT THIS BILL- I DON'T SEE PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE YOU TO SENSE THE USE ONE STANDARDIZED APPROACH TO DO THIS I MEAN THEIR STANDARDS THERE'S PIECES IN HERE TO SAY. THAT THE FOR ACCOUNTABILITY SO I GUESS MY QUESTION TO YOU SEE IS THAT- WHY ANDERSON YEAR THE CONCERN YOU EXPRESSED WHAT PROVISION IN THIS BILL ARE YOU PARTICULARLY WORRIED ABOUT THAT'S CONCRETE ESSENTIALLY A STANDARDIZED COOKIE CUTTER ADMISSION PROCESS THAT WOULD ONLY ALLOW. SO I DON'T REALLY SEE THAT IN THE BILL- SO. IN THE ACTUAL BILL LANGUAGE IN ORDER TO CONCERNS SO CAN CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT FOR ME. YES SIR THANK THEIR PENICILLIN TYLER ARE YOU ARRESTED IN THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA I'M ALL OUT ON THE- YOU LOSE A SORT OF ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT. ON WHY WE FEEL THAT THE PROVISION AND- THAT KIND OF ACCESS TO- DOUBLES WHAT THE METHODOLOGY IS- FOR SELECTION OF- THAT MISSION- WHY THAT. WE FEEL LIKE THAT COULD LEAD TO. YOU KNOW A MORE- SOCIO ECONOMICALLY ADVANTAGED GROUP OF STUDENTS IT'S HARDLY WANT TO- TAKE A STAB AT THAT. THANK YOU SO WE FEEL THAT AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE FEEDBACK THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED FROM THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE THE LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR IS REALLY ASKING FOR A FORMULA WHICH OUR ADMISSION PROCESS IN USE OF COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW THERE IS NO FORMULA CAMPUSES ARE TAKING INTO MULTIPLE FACTORS OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION BASED ON THEIR ACADEMIC. AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY HAVE HAD ACCESS TO OR NOT HAVE ACCESS TO AND SO- YOU KNOW WE CONTINUED TO RECEIVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WELL HOW MUCH WEIGHT IS GIVEN ACCESS OR HOW MUCH WEIGHT IS GIVEN TO Y. WHEN THOSE KINDS OF WEIGHTS ARE NEVER A WIDE THE ENTIRE APPLICATION PORTFOLIO IS LOOKED AT. AND THE STAFF IS MADE FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL SITUATION IS VERY UNIQUE- THE DOCUMENTATION THAT I BEING ASKED FOR SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE SELECTION METHODOLOGY. THE OTHER THING IS THAT. OKAY SO I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THE AUDITOR MIGHT GO ABOUT DOING THIS PERHAPS NOW. POSE A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR YOU'VE HEARD THE CONCERN FROM YOU SEE- DOES YOUR BILL ACTUALLY REQUIRES SUCH. THEY ALL WENT WHEN IT DOES- CALL ON ACTUALLY DOES REQUIRE YOU SEE A P. TO STEP OF SYSTEM WIDE PROTOCOLS. TO AND REQUIRED CAMPUSES UNIVERSITY TAKE THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS SO I GUESS THAT'S FOR INTERNAL BUT PART IS THAT THE NATURE OF THE- METHODOLOGY CAN USE- SO HOW HOW DETAILED METHODOLOGY ARE. YOU INTENDING AND IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL- GIVEN WHAT THE- LUCY'S CAN RAY CHARLES ARMS YES I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION THEN I'LL PASS IT OVER THE STATE ORDER OUR INTENTION WITH THIS IS THAT YOU HAVE A SET OF RULES WHEN YOU GET TO THAT COMPETITIVE SYSTEM A COMPETITIVE POOL. THAT YOU DECIDE IN EVERY CAMPUS CAN DO IT DIFFERENTLY RIGHT WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO IT TO THE SIDE WHO ARE YOU GONNA DO WHO ARE YOU GOING TO MET AND WHY WOULD HAVE LESS OBJECTIVELY LESS. QUALIFIED STUDENT BE OMITTED ALL WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO IS PUT THEIR OWN CRITERIA WE DO THAT FOR EVERYTHING. IT'S NOT UNREASONABLE TO ASK THAT THE CRITERIA. ARE OBJECTIVE AND LAID OUT AHEAD OF TIME. TO AVOID PREFERENCES THAT HAPPEN AND HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED THROUGH THE AUDIT TO HAVE HAPPENED. SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN OVER TO A PODCAST- AND THE POINTS ABOUT. HAVING A COOKIE CUTTER APPROACH ARE WELL TAKEN IT ISN'T THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS ALREADY COVERED THE BASIC GIST OF. OF WHY WE MADE THIS RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS THAT WHEN WE WENT TO THE CAMPUSES THAT WE VISITED DURING THIS ITEM WHICH WAS UCLA BERKELEY AND SAN DIEGO. AT UCLA AND UC BERKELEY. WHEN WE ASKED WHY WERE APPLICANTS THAT THROUGH THE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW PROCESS HAD BEEN ASSIGNED LOWER RATINGS. ADMITTED WHEN HIGHER RATED INDIVIDUALS HAD NOT BEEN. UNIVERSITY COULD NOT EXPLAIN TO US WHY. OKAY IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A REASON IT'S JUST THAT THERE WAS NO METHODOLOGY LAID OUT AHEAD OF TIME THAT THEY COULD POINT US TO SAY. WELL THIS IS HOW WE WERE BUILDING OUR CLASS THIS IS HOW WE WORK. PRIORITIZING CERTAIN OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE STUDENTS PROFILE TO. BUILD THE TYPE OF CLASS WE WANTED THIS YEAR THEY DIDN'T HAVE THAT METHODOLOGY AND JUST TO CLARIFY WHEN YOU SAY LOW RATED HIGH RATED WAS AT THE UNIVERSITY'S OWN RATING OR SEPARATING YOU ASSIGNED THAT IS THE UNIVERSITY'S OWN RATING GIVEN BY ITS APPLICATION REVIEWERS. OKAY ALL RIGHT- OKAY SO I GUESS I'D SAY IS THAT- I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT- I'M GOING CONVERSATION I NOTICED THE SECOND HOUSE TO I THINK PERHAPS SOME CLARITY ON WHAT IS MEANT BY METHODOLOGY I AGREE WITH THAT THE UNIVERSITY ITSELF IN ITS OWN RIGHT NOW I'D HAVE TO BE ALSO LITTLE CLASSES WE SAY REVEALED THAT AGAIN I WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT OF THE UNDERGRADUATE REVIEW PROCESS. THERE IS THERE IS A ROLE IN WHICH ANYONE SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INDIVIDUAL EVALUATION OF AN INDIVIDUAL CANDIDATE AND THEN USED SIR THINK ABOUT HOW YOU BUILD A CLASS SOMETIMES BUT I ALSO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WHEN THEY CAN'T JSTIFY WHAT YOU NEED TO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE EXPLAIN LIKE WHAT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS A SIDE BILL THE CLASS WITH A CERTAIN BALANCE AND SO WHAT WE DID IS WE HAD A GROUP OF STUDENTS HERE THAT SEEMED A LITTLE BIT WHAT'S UNDER FEEL WAITED IN TERMS OF THE CLASS DISTRIBUTION WE LOOKED AT ALL THE THING AND SO WE- TRIED IT MORE THE THEATER THAT. WITH THESE CHARACTERISTICS ETCETERA THAT- ALTHOUGH I THINK IT'S A LITTLE CHALLENGING ASSERTED AND THAT SORT OF QUOTE WEIGHTED DEL- PUT IT OUT IN ADVANCE OF THE OTHER AND FAIRLY BROAD TERMS- BUT- I PERHAPS THERE CAN BE SOME ADDITIONAL WORK DONE I'M JUST CLARIFYING WHAT YOU MEAN BY METHODOLOGY BECAUSE I ALSO THINK THAT IT'S ALSO DANGEROUS TO GO DOWN A PATH WHERE YOU KNOW WE TURN EVERYTHING INTO A NUMBER AND THEN WE SAY WE TRY TO BALANCE THAT OUT TOO BECAUSE I THINK- THAT ACTUALLY GOT TO BE DISADVANTAGES DISADVANTAGES TO. CERTAIN TYPES OF APPLICANTS. OPTICALLY ON. THOSE WITH FEWER OP. SO IT'S A UP A SCHOOL IN THE NUMBER OF EXTRACURRICULAR. ARE TYPES OF RIGHT WE SAW BE CAREFUL NOT DOING THAT KIND OF THING AS WELL- BUT CERTAIN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT- DISCUSSION TO CONTINUE FORWARD. HOPEFULLY PERHAPS WE CAN TRY TO. CLARIFIED ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF YOU SEE. ON THAT AND SO WITH THAT CERTAINLY I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL BUT HOPE YOU'LL WORK WITH YOU SEE PERHAPS JUST TO CLARIFY WHAT YOU MEAN BY METHODOLOGY IN A WAY THAT- DOESN'T OVERLY RESTRICT. THE ADMISSIONS. PROCESS BUT ALSO. AGAIN CALLED ON ACCOUNTABILITY THAT YEAR THAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND I WILL SAYS THE UC BERKELEY GRADUATE IN POLITICAL SCIENCE WE WERE TAUGHT BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE METHODS. SO I THINK METHODOLOGY JUST MEANS THAT THEY HAVE A PLAN AND THEY KNOW HOW THEY'RE BUILDING THAT CLASS. VERSUS NECESSARILY BEING A QUANTITATIVE FORMULA. THANK YOU ANY OTHER CUT SENATOR GLAZERS. THANK YOU- ON THE FIRST DAY ASSEMBLY WOMAN NOT BOERNER HORVATH THANK YOU FOR YOUR ENGAGED IN IN THE SPACE AND FEWER OVERSIGHT IN THE SPACE I MEAN CERTAINLY IT'S THAT. THE KIND OF ISSUE THAT'S PRICKLY AND MY COMMUNITY WHEN- SO MANY QUALIFIED STUDENTS- HAD SET THEIR GOAL TO ATTEND THE UC. AND THEN- STRUGGLE AND- WHEN THOSE RESULTS COMMAND AND THEY WONDER WHY- ONE CLASSMATE YES ONE CLASS RIGHT NOW I MEAN IT'S A STRESSFUL PLACE I KNOW IN THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW WE ARE SENSITIVE TO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIND. UC AND CSU MORE SO THERE'S MORE SLOTS AND THERE'S AN EFFORT IN OUR BUDGET PROPOSAL- THIS YEAR TO TRY TO BUY OUT SOME OF THE OUT OF STATE. STUDENTS SO THAT IT COULD BE GREATER IGNITION SO I KNOW THAT WE ALL SHARE TOGETHER- THE IN THE GOAL OF TRYING TO MAKE OUR UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IS ACCESSIBLE AS WE CAN DO AS MANY CALIFORNIANS SO. ALL THAT BEING SAID. I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS I WANTED YOU SEE TO RESPOND MORE DIRECTLY TO THE AUDITOR'S. OBSERVATIONS ABOUT NOT HAVING. AN APPLICANT ASSESSMENT PROGRAM TRAINING AND MONITORING IN PLACE NUMBER ONE. AND NUMBER TWO. ON THIS ISSUE A METHODOLOGY WHICH THE SENATOR FROM SACRAMENTO HAS RAISED. IT SEEMS THAT IN YOUR INNER CHANGE THAT THE ISSUE IS NOT THAT IT IS. A DISCLOSE METHODOLOGY BUT THAT THERE IS ON THE CAMPUS OF METHODOLOGY. THAT'S DOCUMENTED NOT TO BE THE SECRET SAUCE THAT GETS OUT TO- THE COLLEGE. ADMISSIONS MACHINE THAT CAN FAVOR FROM THE A WELL HEELED. FAMILIES BUT I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU SEE ON THOSE TWO POINTS IS TO- WITH THAT THAT THAT IS IT IS OCCURRING OR IS NOT OCCURRING AS THE AUTHOR SUGGESTS. PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU CENTER THIS IS TYLER- YOU HAVE TO USE THE- OFFERS TO DRESS- THE FIRST QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT- AND I GUESS I WOULD ASK THE HON ME TO SORT OF TALK ABOUT. SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE- TO STRENGTH THEN- THAT THAT FIRST QUESTION AND THEN. IF YOU COULD ALSO I JUST REPEAT THE SECOND QUESTION I MY PHONE BROKE UP A LITTLE BIT AS ONE MAKE SURE YOU'RE CORRECTLY- SO IF YOU COULD ON ME JUST ADDRESS THE FIRST QUESTION ON THE- QUESTION AND THEN THE FIRST QUESTION IS THE APPLICANT ASSESSMENT. FOR TRAINING AND MONITORING READER TRAINING AND MONITORING IS THAT NOT GOING ON. A THE AUDITOR SUGGESTS THAT IT HASN'T BEEN SUFFICIENT TO RESPOND TO THEIR ISSUE. THANK YOU THERE IS ABSOLUTELY. ANNUAL TRAINING EVERY READER HAS TO BE. CERTIFIED ANNUALLY THEY GO THROUGH EXTENSIVE TRAINING INCLUDING IN INCLUDING IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING. AND I BELIEVE THAT IN OUR LAB. TECHNICIAN TO THE STATE AUDITOR WE HAD IDENTIFIED THIS IS A RECOMMENDATION THAT WAS FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND YET. AND THE RESPONSE WE RECEIVED BACK WAS THAT IT WAS ONLY PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED. SO ALSO THE TIMING OF THE COMMISSION. WITH IN THE- WORLD LIKE IN THE VERY CHEAP THE ROAD OF THE ADMISSION SEASON AND SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT OUR CAMPUS IS TO- RESPOND IN A VERY THOROUGH WAY BECAUSE- THE BUSINESS OF. IN THERE THEY WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ADMISSION CYCLE. WHILE YOU'RE PREPARING TO ANSWER THE SECOND QUESTION LET ME JUST SEE IF I COULD NOT INSURE ASK THE AUDITOR TO RESPOND TO THAT THEY SAID THEY PROVIDED AT. A REVIEW- YOU FEEL IT WAS INCOMPLETE CAN YOU SPEAK ANY FURTHER ENLIGHTEN US ANY FURTHER ABOUT THAT. YES I CAN SO THEY DID SUBMIT DOCUMENTATION TO US. A LITTLE BIT THAT THEY CLAIM SUPPORTED THAT THEY HAD ESTABLISHED. THE PROCESSES FOR TRAINING AND MONITORING WE DIDN'T FIND THAT TO BE. THE CASE SO NOT AT ALL CAMPUSES ANYWAY. SO SOME OF THE CAMPUSES HAVE HALF OF THE CAMPUSES THAT USE READERS. HAVE ESTABLISHED A PROFICIENCY STANDARD FOR THOSE READERS MEANING A STANDARD BY WHICH THEY NOW. THE TRAINING WORKED- IT OFTEN WHAT WE SAW DURING THE AUDIT WAS THAT. THE PART OF THE TRAINING INVOLVES REVIEWING PRACTICE APPLICATIONS AND GIVING THEM SCORES AND GETTING. PEER INPUT ON WHETHER WE ALL SAW THIS SITUATION THE SAME WAY AND SCORED IT SIMILARLY AND WHATNOT WELL THE UC NEEDS TO KNOW. YOU KNOW WELL WHAT IS PROFICIENT PERFORMANCE DURING THAT TRAINING PERIOD SUCH THAT WE TRUST YOU TO GO OUT. AND READ REAL LIFE APPLICATIONS WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATELY TRANSFERRED. THE TRAINING INFORMATION FROM US TO YOU THE READERS AND NOW YOU CAN REVIEW REAL APPLICATIONS. ONLY HALF OF STANDARD. AND THEN NONE OF THE CAMPUSES HAVE AN ADEQUATE MONITORING SYSTEM IN PLACE. FOR REVIEWING IN REAL TIME THROUGHOUT THE APPLICATION CYCLE TO SEE OUR READERS DEVIATING FROM WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE. EACH CAMPUS KNOWS. THE GENERAL DISTRIBUTION OF COMPETITIVENESS THAT IT THAT IT USUALLY GETS FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT. THERE MAY BE SOME SLIGHT VARIATION BUT THEY KNOW IN GENERAL APPROXIMATELY EXT PERCENT ARE GOING TO FALL INTO AN UNQUALIFIED OR LESS QUALIFIED CATEGORY. APPROXIMATELY ACTS ARE GOING TO FALL INTO THIS AND THEN THIS IS SIX THE GENERAL. PERCENTAGE QUALIFIED APPLICANTS. NONE OF THE CAMPUSES OF ADEQUATE PROCESSES IN PLACE THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE TO US IN APRIL. FOR CHECKING IN REGULARLY IN THE AGGREGATE ARE WE ARE READERS GENERALLY TRENDING. IN THESE. IN AS EXPECTED IF THEY WARRANTED AND THAT COULD BE A SIGN. OF A COUPLE DIFFERENT THINGS BUT IT'S AT LEAST AN INTERVIEW. AN INTERVENTION POINT TO STEP IN AND SAY. DO WE THINK THAT THIS READERS PROBABLY NOT CALIBRATED WELL AND NEEDS FURTHER TRAINING IN ORDER. SUFFICIENTLY REVIEW UP AND NOW DO NOT. THE DOCUMENTATION IS SUFFICIENT THANK YOU MISTER HARRIS AND I WANNA GO BACK NOW DO YOU SEE AND GIVE THEM ONE LAST CHANCE THEY- THEY SAY YOU'RE NOT. ONLY HALF HAVE- STANDARDS IN PLACE. ON TRAINING AND THERE THERE'S VERY LITTLE MONITORING THAT UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA CAN YOU RESPOND AGAIN TO THAT. YOU SEE EUROPE. THANK YOU YES THE MONITORING ACTUALLY HAPPEN DOES HAPPEN LIVE IN THAT WHEN YOU HAVE MULTIPLE READERS. THE SECOND READER DOES NOT. SEE THE- SCORE OF THE FIRST READER. AND THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THE READER SCORES INDEPENDENTLY IT WILL BE VERY SIMILAR. WHEN WE FIND THAT THEY ARE DISSIMILAR THEY GO T A THIRD GREEN. AND THE CAMPUSES ARE MONITORING THE READERS TO SEE WHY IF THERE IS AN ABUNDANCE OF CASES WHERE I AM. FOR THIRTEEN ARE DISCREPANT THEN THAT DOES READERS WILL BE- I WORKED WITH AND HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN RE NORMED SQL AND THE NORMING PROCESS OCCURS THROUGHOUT THE READING SYSTEM. BUT THE AUDITOR CLAIMS THAT ONLY HALF OF YOUR CAMPUS IS SET STANDARDS IS THAT TRUE. NO I THINK I BELIEVE ALL THE CAMPUSES HAVE EVERY CAMPUS THAT YOU THE READER DOES HAVE STANDARDS. I BELIEVE THAT THE- WHAT WITH THE MINUTE BY THOSE TWO CAMPUSES MAY NOT HAVE MET THE EXPECTATIONS OF WHAT THE AUDITOR WANTED AND SO DURING THESE PAST. SEVERAL MONTHS WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CAMPUSES IN ORDER TO- CLOSE THE GAP. OKAY AND THEN THE SECOND INDICATION THAT WE WILL PROVIDE ALL RIGHT IT SOUNDS LIKE- YOU FEEL YOU'VE MET IT BUT YOU HAVEN'T PROVIDED THE DOCUMENTATION TO PROVE IT TO THE AUDITOR IS SOMETHING YOU HOPE TO ON AN ONGOING BASIS COMPLETE. AT THAT TO SUM IT ALL UP THERE. OKAY YES THAT'S CORRECT. SECOND QUESTION WAS. ABOUT THE- DOCUMENTED METHODOLOGY FOR APPLICANTS SELECTION- IT SEEMS IN THE CONVERSATION TODAY THAT. IT'S NOT THAT THERE HAS TO BE A COOKIE CUTTER THAT'S DISCLOSED AND REVEALED. BUT THERE NEEDS TO BE METHODOLOGY IN PLACE THE AUDITOR CLAIMS THAT SIX OF THE NINE CAMPUSES. DOES NOT HAVE ANY METHODOLOGY ON SELECTION AGAIN METHODOLOGY AS YOU DEFINE SO YOU SEE CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT SPECIFICALLY. YOU SEE. YEAH WE HAVE PROVIDED THE CAMPUS ALL PROVIDED THEIR PRINCIPLES AND VALUES ABOUT HOW THEY SELECT THEIR APPLICANTS. AND AGAIN THAT EXPECTATIONS- WAS NOT FROM THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE WAS NOT MET AND YET OUR FACULTY WHO DESIGN AND THE POLICIES FOR THEIR LOCAL CAMPUSES BELIEVE THAT THE LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY THAT WAS PROVIDED. DOES PROVIDE EIGHT THE ADDAMS. AGAIN THE PRINCIPLES AND THE METHODOLOGY FOR HOW THE CAMPUSES WILL BE SELECTING THEIR STUDENT. OKAY AND MISTER HARRIS YOUR VIEW IS THAT THEY THAT WHATEVER THEY PROVIDED TO YOU DOESN'T AND SIX OF THE NINE CAMPUSES DOESN'T DEFINE A METHODOLOGY AS YOU SEE IT. THAT'S CORRECT AND I WOULD HIGHLIGHT THAT THAT MEANS THREE OF THE CAMPUSES HAVE DONE THIS TO OUR SATISFACTION TWO OF THOSE. ARE VERY MATHEMATICALLY FORMULA DRIVEN BUT ONE IS NOT SO TO THE CONTENTION THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. WOULD RUN COUNTER TO WHAT THE UNIVERSITY IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE I JUST DON'T KNOW THAT. EVEN AT SOME CAMPUSES. HAVE REVEALED THAT DURING OUR AUDIT UC SAN DIEGO HAD A METHODOLOGY THAT WE TALK ABOUT NO REPORT THAT WE FELT LIKE WAS. PRETTY GOOD METHODOLOGY IT IS ACTUALLY SINCE REGRESSED IN APRIL WHEN WE DID OUR FOLLOW UP REVIEW THAT METHODOLOGY HAD DEGRADED IN DETAIL AND HAVE BEEN WATERED DOWN TO BE LESS SPECIFIC. BUT THERE IS STILL ONE UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUS THAT'S NOT FORMULA BASED ON THE WAY IT MAKES ITS DECISIONS. THAT PROVIDED US A METHODOLOGY IN APRIL THAT WE FEEL. YOU KNOW I MET WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR WHEN WE MADE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS SO THIS IS SOMETHING THE UNIVERSITY CAN DO. OKAY AND FINALLY IF I CAN APPRECIATE THE TIME TO THE AUTHOR- YOUR BILL SIMPLY REQUEST AT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIANS ASIAN A SENIOR AND YOU AND I ALL I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU KNOW WE CAN'T MANDATE- AND THAT THAT'S THE FORM IN WHICH YOUR BILL HAS BEEN PRESENTED. AT IT I GUESS THE QUESTION REALLY IS BECAUSE THIS IS LIKE A FIGHT AMONG FRIENDS WE LOVE OUR UNIVERSE YOU CALIFORNIA AS EVERYBODY PERFECT NOW I MEAN MISTAKES ARE MADE IN THEIR BIG CAMPUSES IN THEIR ADMITTING A LOT OF KIDS AND- IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A BLACK BOX WHAT'S FRUSTRATING FOR ALL OF US- AND WE TALKED TO FRIENDS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS ABOUT WHO GETS AND WHO DOESN'T SO IT'S A SENSITIVE POINT. IS THE REALLY DO FEEL AT THIS POINT IN TIME THE NEED FOR YOUR BILL IN YOUR BILL SOMETHING REQUEST CAN WE ARE YOU KNOW A SIX MONTH LAG TIME TO ME IS NOT VERY MUCH TIME TO GET THESE ISSUES TOGETHER. I'M WONDERING IF WE'RE JUST MOVING A LITTLE BIT TOO FAST COULD YOU SPEAK TO THAT SURE- I DISAGREE THAT WE'RE MOVING TOO FAST IF YOU'LL RECALL BACK WHEN WE DID REQUEST THE AUDIT WE ACTUALLY TIMED OUR STATE AUDIT. SO THAT THE UC COULD FINISH THEIR INTERNAL AUDIT FIRST IN THE ORDER COULD REVIEW THAT INFORMATION BEFORE PROCEEDING SO THE UC'S HAVE AMPLE TIME TO FIX THE PROBLEMS OF FAIRNESS AND THEIR ADMISSIONS PROCESS. AND I THINK US AS IN OUR OVERSIGHT CAPACITY HAVE TO STEP FORWARD THE HIGH STANDARDS THAT WE EXPECT FOR SOME OF THE MOST WONDERFUL PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS OF HGHER EDUCATION IN THE WORLD. AND IT IS NOT A IT SHOULD BE WITH IN OUR OVERSIGHT FUNCTION THAT WE SAY THIS STANDARD HAS NOT BEEN MET THIS IS THE STANDARD OF EXPECTATION THAT WE HAVE FOR BEST PRACTICES FOR FAIRNESS. I AM A PROUD UC BERKELEY ALARM I HAVE A GIANT CALIFORNIA MY OFFICE IF YOU COME IN. I WANT GENERATIONS OF CALIFORNIANS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT SAME PRIDE. AND IF WE DO NOT ENSURE THE FAIRNESS IN THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS ESPECIALLY THE TRAINING OF THE REVIEWERS. IT'S THE LEAST SEXY PART OF THE ENTIRE OF. BILLS BUT IT IS THE- BECAUSE DETERMINES. WHETHER OR NOT THESE EQUALLY QUALIFIED APPLICANTS HAVE A FAIR SHOT AND ALL WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO. IS FOLLOW OUR OWN RULES TELL US WHAT YOUR RULES ARE THEY CAN BE DIFFERENT FOR EACH CAMPUS. THAT'S NOT WE'RE NOT DICTATING ANY OF THOSE THINGS. AND AGAIN I WELCOME THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. TO COME BACK WITH. WHAT THEIR CONCERNS ARE THEY HAVE NOT REACHED OUT TO OUR OFFICE TO OFFER MOMENTS OF WHERE THEY CAN WORK ON THIS. BUT I WILL OFFER AGAIN THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. YOU ALL KNOW I ALWAYS MEET WITH EVERYBODY HAPPY TO DO THAT. BUT I THINK WE ARE MISSING AN OPPORTUNITY HERE. TO REALLY ENSURE AND SET THESE HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR THESE HIGH PERFORMING INSTITUTIONS. THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT AND LET ME BE CLEAR THAT I THINK THAT THE- THE ISSUES OF THE AUDITOR REYES ARE LEGITIMATE ISSUES AND I THINK THAT- THAT THEY SHOULD. BE RESOLVED AND I GUESS THE POINT THAT LEAVES ME A LITTLE PERPLEXES THAT I FEEL THAT. THE FEEDBACK FROM THE OF CALIFORNIA. IT SEEMS TO BE RESPONSIVE ALTHOUGH NOT COMPLETE. AND- I WISH THAT WE COULD GIVE THEM OF. THE TIME TO MAKE A COMPLETE AND MAKE THIS BILL REALLY UNNECESSARY THAT'S THE DILEMMA FOR ME THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME TO TOWN I APPRECIATE THAT. I WOULD SAY. IF I WERE. THE PERSON MAKING THE DECISION AND I SAW THE STATE AUDITOR REPORT. I WOULD IMPLEMENT THOSE THINGS AND FULL. AN I WOULD DO IT IMMEDIATELY. A SOME OF THE INFORMATION THAT CAME OUT IN THE AUTUMN WAS A GREGIS. AND THAT SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING AND SO I THINK WE HAVE GIVEN THEM THE LEAD TIME TO DO THEIR OWN ON IT FIRST BEFORE WE WENT IN. WE'VE GIVEN THEM A FEEDBACK OPTION TO SAY HEY IF YOU UPDATED LET US YOU HAVE GIVEN THEM TIME SO I DON'T THINK GIVING THEM MORE TIME. OR PRODUCE A BETTER OUTCOME WITHOUT SETTING UP WHAT A CLEAR STANDARD OF EXPECTATION IS THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU SOME THE WOMAN- CAN WE TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES- YES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A NIGHT OUT VERY GOOD WE HAVE A MOTION. THANK YOU. THE MOTION HAS BEEN MADE BY SENATOR- CHOI BOGUE MADAM CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM NUMBER TWO AB TWO THIRTY THREE THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS SENATOR LEYVA HI. LEYVA AYE OTOBO AYE BUT TROUBLED BY COURTESY. COURTESY I DALY. GLAZER GLAZER NOT VOTING MCGUIRE. PAN ALL RIGHT AND I. BELIEVE THAT BILL ON CALL ASSEMBLY WOMAN YOU HAVE ANOTHER BILL UP AB TWELVE FIFTEEN. PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER AND MEMBERS- MEDICARE REACHER MEMBERS. AB TWELVE FIFTEEN IS A COMPANION BILL TO AB TWO THIRTY THREE. AND TAKES THE NECESSARY COMMONSENSE STEPS TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TRANSPARENCY ACCOUNTABILITY. IN THE UC ADMISSIONS PROCESS. PROTEC IN ATHLETICS EMISSIONS WHICH ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO ABUSE. SPECIFICALLY AB TWELVE FIFTEEN ENSURES THAT DONATIONS AND PERSONAL CONNECTIONS ARE NOT CONSIDERED AN EMISSIONS DECISION THEY DON'T HAVE A PLACE WHERE. WE CHOIRS UC CAMPUSES TO REPORT ON THEIR ATHLETIC COMMISSIONS PROTOCOLS AND OUTCOMES TO PREVENT FRAUD. AND REQUIRES THE UC TO CONDUCT REGULAR INTERNAL AUDITS OF THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS AT UC CAMPUSES. THE TWENTY NINETEEN VARSITY BLUES COLLEGE EMISSIONS SCANDAL SUBSEQUENT STATE AUDIT OF THE UC EMISSION SYSTEM SHOW THAT EMISSIONS FRAUD REMAINS. A PREVALENT AND URGENT ISSUE RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. EVEN IN THE MIDST OF A GLOBAL COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC THE UC RECEIVED AN ALL TIME RECORD HIGH NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS FOR FALL TWENTY TWENTY ONE. EMISSIONS ESTIMATED AT NEARLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND APPLICANTS I INTRODUCED THIS BOTH MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY BECAUSE WE BELIEVE EACH ONE OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND APPLICANTS. DESERVES A FAIR SHOT. FOR EVERY STUDENT ADMITTED EXCHANGE FOR DONATIONS OR AS A FAVOR TO FRIENDS OR FAMILY A QUALIFIED STUDENT LOSES THEIR SPOT. UNLIKE EIGHTY TWO THIRTY THREE WHICH TACKLES THE OVERALL EMISSIONS PROCESS BY REQUIRING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT ENSURE A FAIR AND IMPARTIAL MISSIONS PROCESS. INCLUDING TRADING FOR THE APPLICANT APPLICATION REVIEWERS AND READERS ON THE CONSISTENT AND UNBIASED USE OF ADMISSIONS CRITERIA. AB TWENTY FIFTEEN AT TWELVE FIFTEEN REQUIRES A FIRE WALL BETWEEN THE EMISSIONS STUFF AT A CAMPUS IS FULL OF THE OF PHILANTHROPY STUFF. TO PREVENT PRESSURE TO ADMIT STUDENTS BECAUSE OF FAMILY CONNECTIONS I'M OF. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES EMISSIONS STUFF TO VERIFY STUDENT ATHLETES ATHLETIC ABILITY OR TALENT PRIOR. TO EMISSIONS AND FOLLOW UP AFTER EMISSIONS TO ENSURE STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN THAT. SPORT VERY COMMONSENSE. ALL THE UC STAFF THAT THE UNIVERSE SYSTEMS TAKEN STEPS TO IMPLEMENT THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION AS LEGISLATORS TO ENSURE. TAXPAYER FUNDS ARE USED AS INTENDED AND THAT DESERVING ELIGIBLE STUDENTS ARE NOT DISADVANTAGED BY FAMILIES WITH MONEY AND INFLUENCE. WHAT THE STATE AUDIT REVEALS IS THAT MORE SIGNIFICANT REFORMS ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE WORST OF THE ABUSES RELATIVE TO INFLUENCING EMISSIONS DECISIONS. AS WELL AS DEAL WITH INCONSISTENT AND UNFAIR ADMISSIONS PROCESS THESE OVERALL. AB TWELVE FIFTEEN TOGETHER WITH AB TWO THIRTY THREE WELL INCREASE THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY TO PREVENT FRAUD AND THE UC ADMISSIONS SYSTEM I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON AB. TWELVE FIFTEEN AND AGAIN WE HAVE. OUR STATE AUDITOR HERE AS ARE ARE WITNESSING TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN MISTER HARRIS PLEASE PROCEDURE OF TWO MORE MINUTES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AGAIN BY. STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND AS A REMINDER OUR OFFICE DOESN'T TAKE A POSITION ON BILLS BUT AGAIN I'LL PROVIDE YOU WITH AN OVERVIEW OF HOW AB TWELVE FIFTEEN ADOPTS MANY OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE MADE. TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS IN THE UNIVERSITY'S ADMISSIONS PRACTICES AND GIVE YOU A BRIEF UPDATE AS TO THE LACK OF PROGRESS THAT WE'VE SEEN AT THE UNIVERSITY CENTER ON ITS RELEASE. A COVER THREE AREAS VERY QUICKLY ONE IS THAT FIREWALL BETWEEN DEVELOPMENT OFFICE FUNDRAISING OFFICE STAFF TALKING TO ADMISSIONS STAFF ABOUT SPECIFIC APPLICANTS WE SAW THAT TYPE OF COMMUNICATION GOING ON DURING OUR AUDIT AND SOUGHT AND JULIAN INAPPROPRIATELY AFFECTING ADMISSIONS DECISIONS. THE UNIVERSITY NEEDS TO HAVE THAT FIREWALL IN PLACE PROHIBITING ALL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THOSE TWO STAFF OFFICES ABOUT ANY APPLICANT OR PROSPECTIVE APPLICANTS. BUT IN APRIL WHEN WE CHECK BACK IN WITH THE UNIVERSITY SIX OF THE NINE CAMPUSES STILL DO NOT HAVE AN ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION AGAINST COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN THOSE TWO OFFICES SO THAT REMAINS A PROBLEM. SECONDLY ATHLETICS ADMISSIONS IT'S AN AREA THAT WAS RIPE FOR ABUSE AND THAT WE SAW ABUSE I'VE LEADING TO TWENTY TWO INAPPROPRIATELY LIMITED STUDENT ATHLETES DURING THE PERIOD WE REVIEWED. STILL OF THE NINE CAMPUSES IN APRIL DON'T HAVE ADEQUATE PROCESSES ARE PLANS IN PLACE. TO FOLLOW UP AND MONITOR STUDENT ATHLETE PARTICIPATION IN SPORTS ONE OF THE KEY INDICATORS OF A POTENTIALLY PROBLEMATIC ADMISSIONS. DECISION IS THAT THE STUDENT ATHLETE DOESN'T ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE IN THAT SPORT. DO YOU SEE NEEDS TO. TRACK THAT AND THEN FOLLOW UP AFTER THE FACT TO CONFIRM THAT IN FACT THERE IS NO REASON TO BE CONCERNED OR- TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION AS NECESSARY SIX OF NINE CAMPUSES IN APRIL. STILL DIDN'T HAVE THOSE PLANS IN PLACE AND THEN FINALLY. THE AREA OF REGULAR ONGOING REVIEW BY THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AT EACH OF THE CAMPUSES TO ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS AS- IT'S A KEY CONTROL THAT THEY LACK AND THEY STILL HAVE NO ARTICULATED PLAN. ABOUT HOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO CONDUCT THOSE ONGOING REVIEWS OR THAT AGAIN I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER HARRIS IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN FORTY TWO OR THREE WHO WISHES TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT. FOR AB TWELVE FIFTEEN. SEEING THEN WILL GO TO ROOM TWENTY FORTY. SEEING NONE WILL NOT GO TO LINE'S MADAME MODERATOR DO WE HAVE ANYONE ON THE LINES WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWELVE FIFTEEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWELVE FIFTEEN. PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AN OPERATOR WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR LINE NUMBER AND PLACE YOU BACK IN THE QUEUE. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB TWELVE FIFTEEN. PLEASE PRESS ONE IN THEIR OWN NOW. AT THE TIME I'M SURE WE HAVE NO ONE IN Q. THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW GO TO OPPOSITION I BELIEVE WE HAVE THE SAME OPPOSITION AS IN THE FIRST BILL- WE HAVE. MS YUN WU AND MR THANK YOU ARE SO MISTER YOU ARE WOULD YOU LIKE TO START AS YOU DID LAST TIME. YES THANK YOU MANAGER I'LL BE BRIEF AS WELL AND I'LL JUST AND ALLOW ME TO GIVE HER REMARKS- I JUST. WANTED TO MENTION- YOU VERY QUICKLY THAT WE ARE ALSO OPPOSED AB TWELVE FIFTEEN- I DID WANT TO. MENTION THAT THE UC IS ALREADY TAKEN SIGNIFICANT ACTION- AND RELATE IN RELATION TO ATHLETIC COMMISSION SPECIAL TALENT- THERE IS A LOT LIKE VERIFICATION. ALLOW ME TO KIND OF GO INTO MORE DETAIL ABOUT- THOSE ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN- BUT WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED AB TWELVE FIFTEEN- AND- AND ECONOMY IF YOU WANT TO MAKE YOUR MARKS. GO AHEAD. THANK YOU. FIRST I'D LIKE TO STATE WITHOUT QUESTION AGAIN THAT THE UNIVERSITY SHOULD NOT CONSIDER AN APPLICANT'S AFFILIATION WITH ALUMNI DONORS. STAFF FACULTY OR OTHER EMPLOYEES OF THE UNIVERSITY DURING THE ADMISSION PROCESS. LONGSTANDING UC REGENT POLICY TWENTY TWO OH TWO AND RECENTLY REAFFIRMED THEIR ACADEMIC SENATE RESOLUTION YOU SEE FROM THIS LEGACY ADMISSIONS AND DOES NOT GRANT UNTIL IT MISSION TO THE CHILDREN OF ALUMNI OR DONORS. ALL UC CAMPUSES HAVE UNDERTAKEN AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF WORK. TO IMPROVE AND STRENGTHEN THE POLICIES THAT GOVERN UC'S ADMISSIONS PROCESS. AND ANY GAPS IDENTIFIED WITH OUR LAST ADMISSION TO THE- AUDITOR HAVE BEEN CLOSED. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION CAMPUSES HAVE IMPLEMENTED POLICIES TO PROHIBIT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE DEVELOPMENT AND ADMISSIONS OFFICERS REGARDING APPLICANTS AND PROSPECTIVE APPLICANTS. ATHLETIC TALENT OF RECRUIT STUDENT ATHLETES WILL BE VERIFIED BY AT LEAST YOU REVIEWERS INCLUDING SOMEONE OUTSIDE OF ATHLETICS. ADDITIONALLY THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ADMISSION OF A STUDENT ATHLETE WILL BE INVESTIGATED WHEN PARTICIPATION LAST FOR LESS THAN. ONE YEAR AND WITHOUT A VALID REASON. WE APPRECIATE ALLEGE. ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE AND WE SHARE THE GOAL OF AN THAT. AND LEVEL FEEL FOR EVERY CAN. YOU SEE RESPECTFULLY DISAGREES THAT CAMPUS INITIAL PROCESSES SHOULD BE CONSTRAINED BY STATUTE. MOST OF THE KEY PROVISIONS OF THE BILL HAVE ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED BY OUR CAMPUSES. AND WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THE SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS CAMPUS MADE THAT FAR WILL MINIMIZE THE RISK OF ADMISSION DECISIONS BASED ON INAPPROPRIATE INFLUENCE. WE AFTER THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERED THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION ALREADY TAKEN BY YOU SEE IN THE AREA OF ADMISSION AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THIS LEGISLATION COULD HAVE ON YOU SEE IF IT WERE TO BE SIGNED INTO LAW. WE ARE FIRMLY COMMITTED TO SAFEGUARDING THE FAIRNESS OF ADMISSION PRACTICES INTO MAINTAINING A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR EVERY APPLICATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND CONSIDERATION THIS CONCLUDES MY REMARKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL GO TO ROOM FORTY CHOI THREE FOR ANYONE IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NO ONE WILL GO TO ROOM TWENTY FORTY SEEN NO ONE WILL GO BACK TO THE PHONE LINES. MATTER MODERATED TO HAVE ANYONE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWELVE FIFTEEN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWELVE FIFTEEN PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AN OPERATOR WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH YOUR LINE NUMBER AND PUT YOU BACK INTO Q. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB ONE HE WON FIVE. PUSH PRESS ONE THEN THERE ARE NOW. AND AT THIS TIME I'M SURE WE HAVE NO ONE TO. THINK ABOUT A MODERATOR WE'RE GONNA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE TO HAVE ANYONE WITH ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS OR CONCERNS. CENTER CLOSER THAN SENATOR PAM. THANK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M LEFT A LITTLE CONFUSED AGAIN AFTER LISTENING TO THE TESTIMONY FROM BOTH SIDES AND I GUESS I WOULD GO TO UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIANS SAY THE AUDITORS MADE IT CLEAR THAT LET ME JUST BE CLEAR THAT EVERY AREA THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE AUDIT AND IN THIS BILL I SUPPORT. I SUPPORT I THINK THESE ARE IMPORTANT STANDARDS AND I AND- AMBER WAS LEFT ME CONFUSED IS THAT THE AUDITOR SAYS THAT ON FIREWALLS SIX OF NINE CAMPUSES DO NOT ON ATHLETICS ADMISSIONS SIX OF NINE DO NOT- AND THAT THERE IS AN ONGOING REVIEW BY THE OFFICE OF THE EACH OF THE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS TO ENSURE THE STANDARDS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED I RECOGNIZE THE LETTER FROM PRESIDENT DRAKE- IN NOVEMBER THAT REQUIRES THESE THINGS TO BE DONE BUT YOU SEE CAN YOU PLEASE SPEAK TO. WIDE THE AUDITOR WOULD NOT HAVE DOCUMENTATION THAT YOU ARE IN FULL COMPLIANCE IN THESE AREAS. THE PRODUCT IS PROBABLY WHAT YOU SEE I'M AN AFCON NEED TO FIRST ADDRESS THE QUESTION ABOUT- YES THAT WAS ONE OF THE BEST FIREWALL BETWEEN- DEVELOPMENT AND ADMISSIONS ON ME. THANK YOU. SO BUT I CAN'T IMPLEMENTED THE DEFINITION OF A PROSPECTIVE STUDENT INFO BROAD- A STUDENT WHO IS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL OR MIDDLE SCHOOL IS A PUSHED PROSPECTIVE STUDENT YOU SEE AT SOME POINT. AND SO THE DOCUMENTATION AND THE POLICIES OF THE CAMPUSES HAD SUBMITTED- pSTUDENT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED PROSPECTIVE HOWEVER THE AUDIT- RESPONSE. FROM THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE IT WAS TO REMOVE ALL THAT LANGUAGE INTO FROM THE TIME WHEN THE RESPONSE OF THE SCENE. INTELLIGENT UP UNTIL. LAST WEEK OR A FEW WEEKS AGO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH CAMPUS IS TO CLOSE THOSE GAPS AND THAT HAVE BEEN DONE AND TO ALL THE CAMPUS POLICIES- THAT WERE NOT. MEETING THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE STATE AUDITOR HAVE BEEN CLOSED AND WE HAVE OUR OUR NEXT SUBMISSION TO THE. STATE AUDITOR WILL BE IN SEPTEMBER. pTHE YOU'RE SAYING THIS IT'S GAP THAT WITH THE AUDITOR THEY RECEIVED IN APRIL. NOW IS OUT OF DATE AND YOU HAVE NOT PROVIDED THAT UPDATE YET TO THEM. THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY THEN I GUESS I'D GO BACK TO THE AUTHOR THAT AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR OVERSIGHT IN THIS ISSUE I AGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THE ANALYSIS FROM THE COMMITTEE SAYS QUOTE IT APPEARS AT THE UC HAS TAKEN STEPS TO CORRECT THE DEFICIENCIES- AND GOES THROUGH THE REASONS THAT THE EXAMPLES THAT- YOUR BILL SITES CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHY WHY IS THIS BILL NECESSARY WHEN IT SEEMS THAT THINGS ARE ON A GOOD TRACK THANK YOU FOR YOUR- ENGAGEMENT ON IT TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT IT IS. DO WE REALLY NEED THIS BILL SO YES WE NEED THIS BOOK IF THEY'RE COMPLYING THERE'S NO PROBLEM HAVING THE LEGISLATURE SAY THIS IS OUR EXPECTATION GOING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE THE REALITY IS THEY'VE HAD A YEAR AND A HALF TO DO SOMETHING THAT LET'S JUST BE FRANK IF NOT THAT DIFFICULT IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT TO LET YOU KNOW TO CHECK AND SEE IF THE ATHLETE THAT SUBMITTED FOR THAT PURPOSE IS. ACTUALLY PLAYING. THERE IS IF YOU DON'T A YEAR AND A HALF TO PUT THOSE POLICIES INTO PLACE. SO THE LAGGING IN THE LAGGING IN THE LACKING WITH THIS. IS SHOULD BE A CONCERN TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF US. THAT WE'RE NOW HEARING THE ONLY AFTER THE ORDER SAID. IT'S INSUFFICIENT THAT THEY ACTUALLY MOVE AGAIN. I THINK THAT ALL. THIS ENTIRE UP AGAIN- DISCUSSION. REALLY PROVES THE POINT THAT WE NEED TO BE FOR SAYING VERY CLEARLY FROM THE LEGISLATURE SIDE. THIS IS WHAT OUR EXPECTATIONS ARE. AND THEY IF THEIR INTENT IS TO FOLLOW THAT THEN THERE'S NO PROBLEM. WITH HAVING THE LEGISLATION TO THAT SETS OUT THE OVERSIGHT EXPECTATIONS. GOING FORWARD AND THAT NO MATTER WHO ELSE IS THE PRESIDENT NO UP NO MATTER WHO ELSE IS. THERE THE WE HAVE SAID FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE. WHAT THAT THE SENATE SHOULD BE IN WITH THAT ALTERNATE WITH THE AUDITOR FOR MORE SPECIFICS. RIGHT I CAN'T. I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHAT THE C. MIGHT DONE AFTER WE GAVE THEM OUR FEEDBACK IN APRIL I CAN SAY THAT IN APRIL WITH RESPECT TO THE FIREWALL SPECIFICALLY. THAT GRACE PACKER THAT PROVISIONAL PERIOD DURING WHICH COMMUNICATIONS WERE PROHIBITIVE WAS THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE APPLICATION CYCLE OPENED SO IT WAS A VERY NARROW WINDOW OF TIME. IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE US THEN AND OFF TO PREVENT SOMEBODY WHO IS SAVVY ENOUGH TO KNOW. ABOUT THAT POLICY FROM SKIRTING THAT POLICY BY JUST STARTING THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OFFICE IN THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE. YOU KNOW SIX MONTHS BEFORE THEIR CHILD WOULD APPLY TO THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM SO THAT'S WHY IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THAT PROHIBITION BE ABSOLUTE WE CANNOT THINK OF A TIME. WHERE THERE IS AN APPROPRIATE TIME FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OFFICE AND THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE TO BE DISCUSSING. IT AT ANY POINT IN TIME. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR GLAZERS CENTER PAM. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH AND- APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS FROM MY- GOOD FRIEND US ARE GLAZER- BUT I BUT SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT PROMPT SOME QUESTIONS FOR SOME ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS- SO FOR THE- SIX CALIFORNIA YOU'D MADE REFERENCE TO. THIS DEFINITION OF PROSPECTIVE APPLICANTS AND- I KNOW WE JUST HEARD FROM THE AUDITOR- THIS STATEMENT IN AN AND IT'S HARD TO DISAGREE THAT GâY AT WHAT POINT SHOULD DEVELOPMENT OFFICE ACTUALLY EVER BE IN CONTACT WITH THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE. THAT FOR ME THAT'S FOR YOU SEE OKAY- UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA SO- SO I AGREE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE YOU CAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS SOMEONE AS A CHILD SO FORTH AT WHAT POINT DOES THE DEVELOPMENT OFFICE. HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE DIRECTLY EVEN IF THEY WANT TO DONATE MONEY TO BUILD THE NEW OFFICE FOR THE NATION'S OFFICE THAT SHOULDN'T INVOLVE A CONVERSATION MISSIONS OFF DIRECTLY BUT PERHAPS ANOTHER BRANCH OF UC'S ON JUST TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE. IS YOU DID YOU YOU DID SAY YOU HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THAT SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO ME. WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR THE FUNDRAISING PEOPLE TO THEN TALK TO THE NATION'S PEOPLE. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR PAN. SO THERE ARE ALUMNI AND PARENT PROGRAMS THAT WORK OUT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OFFICE AND OFTEN THEY ARE HOSTING- EVENTS. IN ORDER TO BUILD A CLASS- AFTER STUDENTS HAVE BEEN ADMITTED PARENTS OF CURRENT STUDENTS OR FORMER STUDENTS ARE ADJUSTING ALONGSIDE THEMSELVES WILL HOST AN EVENT AT THEIR HOME IN ORDER TO- YOU KNOW ENTICE STUDENTS TO ACCEPT THEIR OFFERS OF ADMISSION- AND- ALTERNATE- ARE NOT OFTEN MENTIONED IT'S A SAFE BET. AND THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS CONTACT BETWEEN THE ADMISSION OFFICE AND THE DEVELOPMENT. I MEAN NOT BE ABOUT A SPECIFIC APPLICATION FOR PROSPECTIVE APPLICANT BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY. REASON FOR COMMUNICATION TO A CAR BUT NOW WE HAVE PUT THOSE POLICIES INTO PLACE WHERE COMMUNICATION. WILL NOT OCCUR BETWEEN OF JONATHAN. OKAY I'M STILL NOT SURE. AND MAYBE IT'S A BIT OF A MOOT POINT IS SINCE% YOU DON'T DO IT ANYMORE I'M NOT SURE WHY THE ADMISSIONS OFFICE STILL TALKING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OFFICE SO. I CAN IMAGINE DIVISIONS OUTSIDE CONVERSATION WITH ALUMNI OFFICE. ABOUT HEY WE WANT ALUMNI TO HELP YA PERSUADE APPLICANTS TO I GUESS I GUESS AT THIS POINT GOT ADMISSION TO ACTUALLY ACCEPT ADMISSION RIGHTS- BUT THAT'S NOT A FUNDRAISING FUNCTION. IS IT THE ONLY OFFICES GENERALLY WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENT- STRUCTURE. OKAY WITHIN THE ORGANIZATION OF DEVELOPMENT WELL YEAH- BRANDS AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE THERE OKAY WELL AID THAT SO FIRST OF ALL I GUESS I SHOULD BE HAPPY TO HEAR THAT YOU DO HAVE YOU STILL DECIDE TO HAVE A FIREWALL BUT- I DO I DO THINK YOU KNOW THIS YOU TALK ABOUT ETHICS AND SO FORTH- THE PERCEPTION THAT- THAT WOULD CONVEY THAT THERE'S A- LAKE BETWEEN DEVELOPMENTS AND INNOVATIONS. I THINK IT'S ESPECIALLY A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY WOULD BE CONCERNING ONE SO- SO HOPEFULLY AS- ONE LOOKS AT. THE POLICY THAT YOU SEE. THAT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO LINKED IN SOME WAY. BUT I DON'T KNOW BUT WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT. YES AN EXAMPLE. GO HEAD TO HEAD ON THE- I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM THAT THE CAMPUS BECAUSE YOU HAVE THAT POLICY IN PLACE THAT ARE ALL IN PLACE BETWEEN THOSE TWO AREAS OF THE UNIVERSITY YEAH WELL IN% ADDITION TO THE POLICY SO I HOPE YOU IS- THAT THAT SOMEONE IS IN CHARGE OF ADMISSIONS WOULD AGREE WITH ME THAT EVEN ETHICALLY THAT THEY'LL BE PROBLEMATIC. AND THAT OBVIOUSLY YOU DO HAVE SOME POLICIES IN PLACE BECAUSE THAT IS ADMISSIONS OFFICER AND LEADER OF ADMISSIONS THAT YOU SEE YOU WOULD AGREE WITH ME THAT. IN PRINCIPLE THAT'S ALSO PROBLEMATIC. IS THAT CORRECT. YES ABSOLUTELY OKAY I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT- V. OKAY- AND THEN ALL RIGHT AND THEN I DO SO YOU KNOW- ALL RIGHT WELL THANK THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH- YEAH I DID I DO. SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF- SENATE LEADERS QUESTION ABOUT. I GET THE FACT THAT THIS YOU KNOW MAYBE THEY'RE TAKING TOO LONG TO DO THINGS- BUT- ALSO YOU KNOW- EXACTLY WHERE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH THE BILL IF THEY'RE ON THE PATH- THE NEARLY I DON'T KNOW WITH THAT MAKES A MOVE ANY FASTER OR NOT- BUT I CERTAINLY CAN ALSO HEAR YOU WE SAY IT'S A- CLEAR DECLARATION OF THE LEGISLATORS. LEGISLATIVE ATTENDS- BUT THAT THAT APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR PAN CENTER CORTESE. THANK YOU MANAGER FOR ME IS QUESTION FOR MR HARRIS- DO YOU DO YOU HAVE A FULL AUDIT. HERB SCHEDULE ON THIS TOPIC OR ARE YOU DONE. SO WE FOLLOW UP ON ALL OF OUR AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS AT THREE DIFFERENT INTERVALS WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR SO TWO MONTHS AFTER SIX MONTHS AFTER AND THEN ON THE ANNIVERSARY DATE THOSE AT THE REGULAR INTERVALS AT WHICH WE FOLLOW UP ON ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ASSESS WHETHER THEY'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTED OR NOT. THERE'S AN ANNUAL FOLLOW UP PROCESS IF THERE ARE STILL RECOMMENDATIONS THAT AREN'T IMPLEMENTED WE FOLLOW UP ANNUALLY FOR FIVE MORE YEARS- WE ALSO DO HAVE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO CONDUCT FULL BLOWN FOLLOW UP ON IT WORK- SO THAT'S AN OPTION WE HAVE. FOR ANY OF THE AUDITS WE CONDUCT BUT ARE YOU GENERAL PROCESSES TO FOLLOW UP THREE TIMES WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR. IN THOSE IN THOSE FOUR PARTS ARE SHARED. WITH THE LEGISLATURE. CORRECTED EVERY WEEK AND IF WE SO WITH THE RECOMMENDATION ASSESSMENTS WE POST ALL OF THOSE PUBLICLY AND WE CERTAINLY BE HAPPY TO. FACILITATE GETTING ANYBODY IN THE LEGISLATURE WHO'S INTERESTED IN- THAT INFORMATION- SO WE POST ALL OF OUR ASSESSMENTS OF RECOMMENDATION STATUS TO OUR WEBSITE. AS THE AGENCIES SUBMIT. THEIR UPDATES TO US AND WE REVIEW THE DOCUMENTATION. DECIDE WHETHER WE AGREE WITH THEIR CLAIMS ABOUT PROGRESS AND THEN WE POST THAT PUBLICLY- AND THEN IF WE WERE TO CONDUCT A FULL BLOWN FOLLOW UP ON IT WE WOULD PUBLISH A REPORT PUBLICLY MAKE OURSELVES AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. WILL TAKE MEASURES. YOU KNOW THAT THAT HELPS ME. TO MAKE IT. A FINAL DECISION IN TERMS OF WHERE I'M AT ON ON THE BILL- I DON'T REALLY- SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON ISSUES LIKE THIS CONCERNING MYSELF WITH THE FACT THAT- IN THIS CASE YOU SEE IS ALREADY TAKEN STEPS TO CORRECT DEFICIENCIES IN THE PROCESS BECAUSE- IF NOTHING ELSE. YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING IMITATION IS THE GREATEST FORM OF FLATTERY IS HOW THEY SHOULD HOLD THIS I THINK AS AFFIRMING. OF THE STEPS THEY'VE ALREADY TAKEN IF THEY FEEL THAT THERE. ARE TWO PROTECTIVE IN ANY WAY- BUT I THINK THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN AS- IS AFFIRMATION THAT THE- THE DOING THE RIGHT THING BUT ALSO A CODIFICATION. OF WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE- IN A CODIFICATION OF A THINKCENTRE BENCHMARK AS THE AUDITOR COMES BACK. TO CHECK AND MAKE SURE THAT THOSE POLICIES HAVE- HAVE THAT STAYED IN PLACE AND ARE CONTINUING TO WORK. ALBEIT THE LEGISLATURE BUT WON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO MANDATE ON ON THE CONASAUGA STATION TO DO SOMETHING BUT THIS LEGISLATURE COULD FALL UPON THOSE AUDITS SERVE WITH LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS- IF HE AND OTHER METHODS. TO DRAW ANY CONTINUING PROBLEM AND I THINK AT THAT POINT BUT IT WILL BE A LOT EASIER. AGAIN THE BENCHMARK THOSE HEARINGS AS AS TO WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS ALREADY ACTED AND SAID THIS IS WHAT THE EXPECTATIONS ARE GOING TO BE A IN THE EVENT THE LEGISLATURE COMES BACK AND TAKES ANOTHER LOOK AT THIS AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE BE TWELVE FIFTEEN BECAUSE AND- I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS IN THAT REGARD I'M SPEAKING TO THE AUTHOR AT THIS POINT SO.

AND TO DIDN'T HAND A ONE SCHOOLS WERE HELD FOR THE 25% OF STUDENTS WHO LIVE BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE. NO ATTENDED HOW TO ONE SCHOOL. IT ALSO DOESN'T INDIVIDUALS AND COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. I DEMONSTRATED THERE ARE VERY MANY TIMES AT% SCHOOL WERE AND HOW DESTRUCTIVE TO MY LEARNING FROM HAVING TO GO HOME DUE TO LACK OF DIRECT ACCESSIBILITY TO NATURAL PRODUCTS. NOT ONLY HAVE I HAD THESE EXPERIENCES SO MANY OF MY PEERS HAVE ALSO HOW TO MAKE MAKE SURE IT'S NATURAL PRODUCTS OUT OF TWELVE PEOPLE IN SCHOOLS. THIS SHOULD BE THE CASE AFTER THREE MONTHS OF COLLEAGUES IN THE BASIC NEEDS IT SHOULD BE A HUMAN RIGHT AND IT'S TIME THAT WE START MAKING IT ONE OF THE READING. PRETTY MUCH A PART OF THE COUNTRY.

EVERY TIME I WOULD HEAR ONE OF THE STORIES MY HEART WOULD ACHE BECAUSE IT USUALLY RESULTED AND ADMINISTRATOR BEING FORCED TO USE AND PLANETARY MEAN MISSING EXCESSIVE CLASS TIME OR PRACTICE OR LEAVING SCHOOL ENTIRELY. MENSTRUATE IS LIKE EASE AND MYSELF LIVE AND BREATHE THAT STIGMA EVERY DAY THAT WE STEP INTO A PUBLIC BATHROOM THAT DOES NOT. HAVE FREE PERIOD PRODUCTS.

THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I RISE TODAY TO. PRESENT AB NINE FOUR FIVE TO HELP ENSURE THE NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS MAY EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO WEAR ITEMS OF SPIRITUAL OR CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE GRADUATION CEREMONIES. AB NINE FOUR FIVE ESTABLISHES A TEN MEMBER TASK FORCE OF CALIFORNIAN NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBAL MEMBERS AN APPOINTEE FROM THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION. THIS TASK FORCE WILL BE CHARGED WITH GATHERING INFORMATION ABOUT NON COMPLIANCE WITH THIS PROTECT IT RIGHT AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE IT WOULD ALSO BE CHARGED WITH RECOMMENDING BEST PRACTICES TO EIGHT SCHOOL AUTHORITIES IN ENSURING THE EXISTING PROTECTIONS OF STUDENTS. RIGHT TO WEAR TRADITIONAL TRIBAL REGALIA OUR RECOGNIZE OBJECTS OF RELIGIOUS OR CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE AS AN ADORNMENT AT SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONIES. IN TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN MY GOOD FRIEND TODD GLORIA WHO'S NOW THE MAYOR OF SAN DIEGO MOVED FORWARD ON A BILL BUT STILL WE SEE THROUGHOUT THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM THAT THERE'S NOT PARITY AND ALLOWING STUDENTS TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND SHOW PRIDE. IN THE REGALIA- OF NATIVE AMERICAN- AREAS CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO OVER SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS WHO IDENTIFY AS NATIVE AMERICANS REPRESENTING THE LARGEST STATEWIDE POPULATION OF NATIVE AMERICANS IN THE UNITED STATES. NATIVE AMERICAN GRADUATES WANT TO DEMONSTRATE PRIDE IN THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENTS TO THEIR FAMILY INTO THE TRIBE THAT THAT THEY REPRESENT. CULTURAL ITEMS OFTEN ARE GIFTED TO THOSE OF SOMETHING OF ACHIEVEMENT AND SOMEONE SOMEONE IS GRADUATING FROM SCHOOL THEY MADE THAT MARK IN IN THE INDIAN COMMUNITY THIS STILL IS THAT PARITY OF THOSE- GRADUATING FROM HIGH SCHOOL THAT'S STILL FAR BELOW THOSE OTHER GROUPS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WHEN THEY HAVE A MEAL AND THEY GO THEY'RE GIFTED THINGS OF EAGLE FEATHERS OF DIFFERENT REGALIA IT'S A PRIDE FOR THE FAMILY FOR THEM TO WEAR AND WALK A CROSS THAT'S- TO EARN THEIR DIPLOMA. THIS BILL ENSURES THAT THAT PRIDE THAT SUCCESS IS NOT DETERRED BY ANY POLICY THAT'S OUT THERE IS SPECIALLY WHEN IT'S ALREADY LAW. THIS BILL WOULD START TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT RIGHT IS EXERCISED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGHOUT OUR ACADEMIC.
