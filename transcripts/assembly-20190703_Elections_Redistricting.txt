WHENEVER YOU'RE READY SIR. I RECENTLY OBSERVED THE PURSUIT OF A REFERENDUM IN ONE OF MY CITIES WHERE A CLEVER BURDEN WAS IMPOSED. I FOUND IT TO BE ONEROUS AND OBSTRUCTIVE TO THE DEMOCRATIC FREEDOMS WE SHOULD ENJOY IN THIS STATE. WHEN A GROUP OF CITIZENS OPPOSE THE DECISION OF ITS CITY COUNCIL IF FILE TO COLLECT SIGNATURES? TO PUT A RESPONSE ON ITS BALLOT THE CITY COUNCIL. AUTHORIZED THE SIGNATURE GATHERING WITH ONE PROVISO ATTACH THE INFIRM ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT. TO THE PETITION. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT WAS SOMEONE THOUSAND PAGES AND CONSEQUENTLY VERY EXPENSIVE TO REPRODUCE. THERE'S EXHIBIT A THIS IS WHAT THE PETITION GATHERERS HAD TO CARRY AROUND. THE TO GET SAYS SIGNATURES FOR THE BALLOT MEASURE THIS THIS ENTERPRISES CITIZENS FROM PARTICIPATING IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND IT SHOULD BE AVOIDED. A SUMMARY OF THE E. I. R. SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAN ADEQUATE AND ALWAYS WHO'S GONNA WHO'S GONNA TODAY AND READ THE WHOLE E. I. R. BEFORE THEY SIGN A PETITION LET ALONE. MAYBE THEY COULD JUST GO TO A WEBSITE AND LOOK AT THE PERTINENCE. SB THREE FIFTY NINE TRIES TO FIND A COMPROMISE BETWEEN AND A MASK ON AND I'M A MASSIVE BOATING KERR. DOCUMENT AND NO PROJECT DETAILS AT ALL SURELY A TEN POUND DOCUMENT IS OVER KILL IN MORE WAYS THAN. ONE WASTE THE PAPER. THE PRINTING TOOK A NUMBER OF CIRCULATION DAYS AWAY FROM THE PETITIONERS. SO ATTACHING SPECIFIED DECORATIONS TO REFERENDUM PROTECTION SHOULD BE A REASON WHY POSITION AND NOT A CUMBERSOME OBSTACLE TO THE EXERCISE OF PARTICIPATORY GOVERNMENT I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST TONIGHT.

THE MOST IS TO PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN HI BERMAN I GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER AYE CALDERON CALDERON AYE LOW. MAYES. MAYES AYE MULLIN. WEBER I'VE WEBER ON THAT BILLS OUT ONLY WITH WITH FIVE VOTES WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THINK THE SENDER. AND I SEE CENTER AMBERG -- AS JOINED US WITH ITEM NUMBER NINE SB SIX NINETY SIX CHAIR ON BURKE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- HIM BEFORE YOU SB. SIX NINE SIX PURPOSE IS TO PREVENT MISLEADING VOTER REGISTRATION. THE IMPETUS OF THIS BILLS TO REDUCE VOTER CONFUSION AND TO EFFECTUATE VOTER INTENT CALIFORNIA TODAY. THE SECOND LARGEST GROUP OF VOTERS IN INDIVIDUALS ARE REGISTERED AS NO PARTY PREFERENCE. THIS GROUP IS MORE COMMONLY REFERRED TO IS INDEPENDENCE. YOU SEE THAT AND POLLING DATA YOU SEE THAT. AS REPORTED IN VARIOUS PUBLICATIONS THIS GROUP IS TWENTY EIGHT POINT 6% OF CALIFORNIA VOTING ELECTORATE. IS THE FASTEST GROWING SET OF ALL VOTERS IN FACT I THINK IT'S THE SECOND LARGEST IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. NOR REDUCE VOTER CONFUSION ESPECIALLY AMONGST VOTERS. WHO WISH TO NOT REGISTER WITH ANY PARTY AND STAY INDEPENDENT THE POLITICAL PARTIES? SB SIX NINE SIX WILL PROHIBIT THE NAME OF A POLITICAL PARTY FROM INCLUDING THE WORD INDEPENDENT. DECLINE TO STATE OR NO PARTY PREFERENCE OR ANY VARIATION OF THOSE WORDS. UNDER EXISTING LAW IT IS PROHIBITED FOR THE NAME OF A NEW PARTY TO BE SIMILAR TO AN EXISTING PARTY TO AVOID MISLEADING VOTERS. SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU COULDN'T FORMA PARTY THEY CALLED THE DEMOCRATS OR THE REPUBLICANS. UNFORTUNATELY THIS PROTECTION DOES NOT EXTEND INDEPENDENT VOTERS. CURRENTLY THE STATE OF WYOMING BANDS THE WORD INDEPENDENT IN THE NAME OF ANY NEW POLITICAL PARTY. TODAY THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY IS OVER A HALF MILLION REGISTERED MEMBERS MORE THAN ALL OF CALIFORNIANS OTHER MINOR PARTIES COMBINE. THE REASON FOR THIS LARGE AMOUNT OF REGISTERED. AMERICAN PEN PARTY MEMBERS IS THAT CALIFORNIA'S VOTER REGISTRATION CARD. LIST POSSIBLE PARTIES IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER. SO AS A RESULT THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY IS THE FIRST CHOICE. THAT FOLKSY -- AT THE ENVY FOR EXAMPLE. A POLL CONDUCTED BY THE LOS ANGELES TIMES FOUND THAT FEWER THAN 4%. A REGISTERED AMERICAN INDEPENDENT VOTER PARTY VOTERS. COULD CORRECTLY IDENTIFY THEIR OWN REGISTRATION IS A MEMBER OF A PARTICULAR PARTY THE AMERICAN. INDEPENDENT PARTY THE SAME POLL NOTED THAT MORE THAN 50%. A REGISTERED AMERICAN IN PENN PARTY MEMBERS WANT TO LEAVE THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY. ONCE THERE READ EXCERPTS OF THEIR PARTY'S PLATFORM. EVEN THE OF FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY MARK SEIDENBERG. ACKNOWLEDGES VOTER CONFUSION BY SAYING QUOTE THIS IS IN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES QUOTE. A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING WHEN THEY FILL OUT A FORM. END QUOTE MR SEIDENBERG WENT ON TO SAY THAT ONE REASON THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY. DOES NOT WANT TO CHANGE ITS NAME IS THAT THE PARTY WOULD BE FORCED TO QUOTE GET NEW VOTERS AND THAT'S EXPENSIVE. END QUOTE. UNLIKE REGISTERED VOTERS AS NO PARTY PREFERENCE THOSE ARE TRUE INDEPENDENCE. WHO ARE REGISTERED WITH THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY -- IF YOU'RE REGISTER WITH AMERICAN PEN BAR YOU CAN'T CAST YOUR VOTE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY. UNLESS PARTICULAR IMPORTANT AS IT IS THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL PRIME IS COMING UP NEXT MARCH -- THIS VOTER CONFUSION HAS REAL WORLD CONSEQUENCES IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY DISTRICT A SPEAR COURT JUDGE. ORDERED ALEXIAN OFFICIALS TO CHANGE AN INDIVIDUAL VOTERS REGISTRATION. TO NO PARTY PREFERENCE SO THAT HER BALLOTS COULD BE COUNTED IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY. AFTER SHE PETITIONS SAYING THAT SHE HAD MISTAKENLY REGISTER WITH THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY. A CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE -- NOT AT THE SUIT TO EXERCISE THEIR FRANCHISE WITH ME IS MISTER PAUL MITCHELL -- SACRAMENTO BASED ELECTIONS EXPERT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU PLEASE THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I FIRST OFF I WANT TO NOTE THAT THERE IS EXCELLENT COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT GOES THROUGH A LOT OF THESE DETAILS AND GIVES THE HISTORY -- I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW ABOUT MY PERSONAL HERE'S HISTORY WITH THIS AS SOMEBODY WHO'S WORKED IN ELECTIONS FOR THE LAST. THIRTY YEARS. I THE HISTORY MOSTLY HAS BEEN ANECDOTAL. OF FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS CAMPAIGNS KNEW THAT WHEN THEY SAW SOMEBODY WHEN THE PRECINCT WALKING OR TALK TO SOMEBODY ON THE PHONE WHO WAS AMERICAN INDEPENDENT. THAT THEY WERE VOTER PROBABLY WANTED TO REGISTER INDEPENDENT. AND AS WE BROUGHT THIS ISSUE UP THE FEEDBACK WE ALWAYS RECEIVED WAS THE YOU KNOW THIS IS JUST ANECDOTES. AND SO I WORKED WITH THE LA TIMES -- WITH DEMOCRATIC POLLSTER BEEN TOLD CHEN AND REPUBLICAN POLLSTERS SMITH JOHNSON RESEARCH TO ACTUALLY DO THE FIRST STUDY OF THESE VOTERS. AND WE CONTACTED. AS MANY AS VOTERS AS WE COULD FROM THAT POLITICAL PARTY TO TRY TO IDENTIFY NOT JUST POLICY STANCES BUT WHETHER THEY COULD IDENTIFY THEIR POLITICAL PARTY AND AND IF THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE BEING MISINFORMED. AND AS THE ANALYSIS SITES AND AS WAS NOTED BY THE SENATOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE. THAT WERE CONTACTED DID NOT KNOW THAT THEIR REGISTERED WITH THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY. IN FACT IN OUR MOST RECENT -- OPENED. UP IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A PART OF CALIFORNIA WEEKLY. ARE A CAPITAL WEEKLY -- WE'VE BEEN DOING SOME POLLING AND AS OF THIS MORNING. WE CONTINUE TO DO POLLING I'M GONNA READ YOU RESPONSES FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE NAMING THEIR POLITICAL PARTY IN A PULL THIS MORNING. THESE ARE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY VOTERS AND THE RESPONSES READ INDEPENDENT INDEPENDENT INDEPENDENT NON INDEPENDENT INDEPENDENT INDEPENDENT INDEPENDENT INDEPENDENT. NINE MOSTLY INDEPENDENT INDEPENDENT INDEPENDENT NO PARTY AFFILIATION INDEPENDENT INDEPENDENT YOU HAVE TO GO DOWN ABOUT A HUNDRED RESPONSES FROM PEOPLE. WHO ARE REGISTERED AMERICAN INDEPENDENT WHO WHEN POLLED AND ASKED WHAT IS YOUR POLITICAL PARTY? CAN PROPERLY IDENTIFY THAT THE REGISTERED AMERICAN INDEPENDENT. I SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS CONTINUED EVEN THOUGH WE'VE SHOWN A LIGHT ON IT WITH THE LA TIMES. IT'S SOMETHING THAT HAS CONTINUED I YOU KNOW EVEN AS THEIR OF AN ACTIVE CAMPAIGNS AND EFFORTS TO TRY TO INFORM VOTERS -- AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT AT THIS POINT I BELIEVE TALKING WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE AND WITH LEGISLATORS. THERE'S REALLY NO OTHER APPROPRIATE REMEDY TO TRY TO RESOLVE THIS. IT DOES BRING UP IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS SOME CONCERNS ABOUT. THE ISSUE OF IS THERE A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST AND MY ARGUMENT IS THAT VOTER INTENT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT YOU AS A COMMITTEE OR THE STATE AND MINISTERING ELECTIONS CAN. HOLD ON TO IS VOTER INTENT AND THERE'S CLEAR VOTER INTENT HERE FOR PEOPLE TO REGISTER AN AFFILIATE WITHOUT BEING A PART OF A POLITICAL PARTY BEING INDEPENDENT OR NO PARTY PREFERENCE. THE SECOND ISSUE IS FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION DOESN'T COUNT IF YOU'RE BEING MISLED OR TRACTOR UNAWARE OF WHAT YOUR ASSOCIATING WITH. AND WE HAVE A LOT OF EVIDENCE AND CONTINUE TO BUILD EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT PEOPLE REGISTERED AMERICAN INDEPENDENT. ARE NOT INTENDING TO BE A PART OF THIS POLITICAL PARTY I AM BE AFFILIATED WITH IT -- THEY ARE CHOOSING TO BE NO PARTY PREFERENCE AND I ALSO WANT TO BE DOWN ONE RUMOR. THAT IS THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT JUST HAPPENS TO LOW INFORMATION VOTERS. PEOPLE WHO JUST DON'T GET IT ACCIDENTALLY GET TRICKED INTO THIS -- THERE ARE TWO FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE OF INCUMBENT STATE LEGISLATORS WHO BEEN REGISTER AMERICAN INDEPENDENT. THERE IS STAFF MEMBER THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE AND THERE IS A MEMBER OF THIS CURRENT ADMINISTRATION. THAT HAVE BEEN REGISTERED AMERICAN INDEPENDENT INCORRECTLY. SOME VERY VERY VERY ENGAGED AND IN A COUPLE CASES ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY HAD INADVERTENTLY REGISTERED WITH A POLITICAL PARTY WITH VERY STRIDENT POLITICAL STANCES. AND IN FACT THEY THOUGHT THEY REGISTERED INDEPENDENT. AND AS WE GO TOWARDS THE PRIMARY WE START TO SEE WHERE THIS REALLY HAS AN ACT AN ACUTE HARM. IF SOMEBODY IS AMERICAN INDEPENDENT AND ALL THEIR IF THEY BELIEVE THEY'RE INDEPENDENT. AND THEY'RE READING IN THE PAPERS AND SEEING ON THE NEWS THAT THEY CAN VOTE AND THE OPEN PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARIES. THEY WOULD NOT BE. PLANNING ON DOING OTHER THING THAT JUST GETTING THEIR BALLOT AND SEEING THE OPPORTUNITY VOTE FOR THOSE PRIMARY CANDIDATES BUT IN FACT THEY CAN'T. AND AS WAS NOTED -- THERE WAS ONE INSTANCE WHERE A JUDGE INTERVENE -- SO. IT IS VERY SERVICES UNIT ISSUE AND I APPRECIATE THE TIME TO TALK ABOUT IT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IT IS NOTICES IN SUPPORT. I WANT TO GO WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PARKS ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. WE'RE SORRY THAT WE'RE TALKING WITH OUR LETTER WE ONLY MET JUST THIS LAST FRIDAY THOUGH BUT WE VOTED IN SUPPORT OF THIS THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. TIFFANY MARKHAM BEHALF OF THE SECRETARY STATES OFFICE WE ARE IN SUPPORT. ADDRESS FOR LACK OF A LETTER AT THIS POINT. WHEN IS IT IN SUPPORT THE SECOND. THE MEDICAL ROOM LOWERED. OKAY.

I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR FOR WHERE I COULD ACTUALLY SAY THIS SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME I'LL TRY TO STICK TO TWO MINUTES. FIRST OFF I WANT TO SAY -- I WANT TO BE HERE BECAUSE DONALD TRUMP IS GREAT AS PRESIDENT THAT WE PASSAGE GEORGE WASHINGTON. I DON'T TAKE NO BONES ABOUT THAT HE IS THE BEST AND MY NAME IS VINCE IN MAY. CHAIRMAN BERMAN ARE I'M WITH AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY HERE TO POSE BILLS. SIX NINE SIX AS MARINE FORMER LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER IT IS MY PRIVATE PRACTICE TO FOLLOW RULES AND REGULATIONS. BUT THE RULES PROPOSED BY SB SIX NINE SIX FRANKLY MAKES YOU WANT TO MUTINY. THIS BILL RE ECTS SUPPORTERS PARTISAN MOTIVES. IT SINGLES OUT FOR MANY AMOUNTS TO POLITICAL CAPITAL PUNISHMENT BUT BUT WHY. WHY ARE PARTY NOMINATION NOMINATED DONALD TRUMP? AND WE ARE IN AT JUST WHAT NORMALLY DONALD TRUMP. AND IF WE WERE TO POPULAR WE WERE NOT TO POP AT THE TIME. IN SOME QUARTERS BEFORE WE BECAME BEST DEBT DECIDEDLY LESS SO AS A RESULT MOREOVER SOME MISPLACED SUPPORTERS. OF A CERTAIN CANDID OF TWENTY SIXTEEN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION. WHO WE REGISTERED DISCOVERED THAT WE COULDN'T VOTE IN A FAVORABLE CANDIDATE? AS AND SINCE THE DAY AND SINCE THEY COULD ACCEPT COULD NOT ACCEPT. THE CONCLUSIONS THEY JUST WEREN'T TOO BRIGHT. WE HAVE THIS INTOLERABLE BAD REMEDY TO MAKE MINOR PROBLEM. WELL THIS MARINE HAS A STRAIGHTFORWARD SOLUTION AMOUNT TO A FRONTAL ASSAULT OF A MAJOR OBSTACLE. WHICH IS SIMPLER AND CHEAPER THAN WHAT WE DO NOW FOR PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY ELECTION PERIOD IS. JUST -- ALL THE CABINETS IN ONE PARTY REGISTRATION OR MID INDEPENDENT CANDIDATES WHO WOULD RUN IN GENERAL ACTIONSIS NOW. INTO A SINGLE BALLOT GROUP BY CANDIDATE PARTY AFFILIATION THE VOTERS PICKED A FAVORITE. AND AND THEIR JOB IS DONE THE VOTE IS BEING MADE IN A POLITICAL PRIMARY OF THE PRIMARY VEHICLE AND AND WHICH TO WHICH THE CANDIDATE IS AFFILIATED. IF YOU WANTED EMERGENCY LIKE THAT IF YOU WANT SOME EMERGED TO LEGISLATE LEGISLATE THAT SIR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. WITHIN TWO MINUTES THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YEAH AND GET YOUR NAME ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING IN YOUR POSITION ON THE BILL. I AM -- PHELPS HOBART. ON THE SACRAMENTO COUNTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE. THE CHAIRMAN OF FOR THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY [inaudible] OF IMAGES STATE ARE YOU AGREE WITH OUR CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR -- LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE DON'T CHANGE THE NAME THANK YOU. THAT'S WHEN THIS. MY NAME IS CITY WEBER SACRAMENTO HIGH NOT SPEAKING FOR ANY ORGANIZATION. I'M BASICALLY ASKING FOR A AN AMENDMENT. COUPLE YEARS AGO -- IT THANK YOU YEAH YOU WERE AT THE POINT OF OF NAME ORGANIZATION AND OPPOSITION OR SUPPORT OF THE BILL WE HAD THREE WITNESSES. SPEAK TO THE BILL -- GREATLY EXCEEDING THE TIME THAT WE USUALLY. PROVIDE BECAUSE OF MY MISTAKE ON THE FOR SIDE -- SO IF YOU WANT TO SUGGEST AMENDMENTS PLEASE SUBMIT THEM IN WRITING. I DID AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY LOOKED AT HIM OKAY THANK YOU SEE DO YOU LIKE IT. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRING ABOUT A COLLEAGUES FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS OF THE VICE CHAIR MISTER MAYES THAN ANYONE ELSE. STILL I MEAN FOR ME THIS BOILS DOWN TO A DISAPPEAR CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUE -- THIS IS A PARTY THAT'S HAD THAT NAME SINCE AS I UNDERSTAND IT. NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT THERE IS IT THAT THE FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION ISSUE IS IS ONE OF THE PARTIES. AND THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THE NAME THAT THEY'VE HAD FOR THE LAST. FIFTY PLUS YEARS -- AND FOR US TO COME IN AND SAY HEY WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE YOUR NAY ESSENTIALLY FORCE THEM. TO CHANGE THEIR NAME YOU KNOW THE YOU KIND OF IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE KIND OF CUT AROUND THE EDGES THIS YES FIRST YOU WOULD NEED A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST TO DO SO BECAUSE IT WOULD CLEARLY BE A FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUE. YOU NEED A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST IN HOW TO BE NARROWLY TAILORED. TO ACCOMPLISH THE PURPOSE. AND HERE I I DON'T KNOW THAT A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST IS THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE CONFUSED. AND ANYBODY COULD READ THEIR PLATFORM ANYBODY COULD GO ON AND LOOK AND SEE WHAT THEIR PARTY IS ABOUT AND DECIDE WHETHER NOT TO BE PART OF THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY OR NOT -- THE FACT THAT OUR ELECTORATE. YOU KNOW MAY NOT UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW WHAT THEY'RE VOTING FOR I MEAN AT I THINK THERE'S PEOPLE AROUND THIS ROOM WHO WOULD ARGUE THAT. YOU KNOW. PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT ELECTIONS ALL THE TIME THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY -- WELL INFORMED. IF YOU WILL -- BUT I DON'T KNOW THERE'S A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST AGO FORCE THEM. YOU KNOW -- TO TO CHANGE OF A PARTY NAME TO DO SO -- AND THEN YOU HAVE TO BE NARAL NARROWLY TAILORED I MEAN IF YOU WANTED TO GET OUT THAT ISSUE OF VOTER CONFUSION. THE STATE HAS RESOURCES TO EDUCATE PEOPLE IN FACT WE HAVE A BILL. MOVING THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW THAT WOULD REQUIRE THREE NOTICES TO GO OUT -- TO VOTERS BEFORE -- BEFORE THE PRIMARY ELECTION I BELIEVE IT IS -- JUST SO DON'T KNOW HEY ARE YOU SURE THIS IS THE PARTY YOU WANT TO BE REGISTERED WITH -- AND AND AND ALSO TO KNOW A IF YOU WANT IT WOULD. BE A A TRUE INDEPENDENT AND BILL IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY FOR INSTANCE -- YOU KNOW SO THAT THE STATE HAS ITS OWN RESOURCES TO GET INFORMATION OUT THERE TO VOTERS WHO MIGHT BE CONFUSED -- AND THAT WOULD BE A MUCH LESS. THAT WOULD BE A MORE NARROWLY TAILORED WAY OF GETTING OUT THAT PURPOSE THEN MAKING A PARTY THAT'S EXISTED FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS CHANGE ITS NAME -- AND SO I MEAN I THINK. EVEN IF YOU'RE ABLE TO GET THIS BILL PASSED IT'S GONNA GET STRUCK DOWN BY THE COURTS. AND TO ME I JUST. I THINK THERE'S OTHER THINGS WE COULD DO TO HELP BETTER EDUCATE. THE THE THE VOTING PUBLIC AND THAT'S KIND OF LARGE HOUSE LOOK AS NOT ANSWER THE GOVERNMENT'S JOB TO DO. IT'S I THINK ALL OF OUR JOBS TO DO IS TO HELP EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THEIR GOVERNMENT THAT'S PART OF WHAT I DO AS A REPRESENTATIVE. I THINK EVERYBODY AROUND THIS TABLE DOES THAT -- BUT THIS JUST SEEMS LIKE A VERY DRASTIC AND AT USING A HAMMER -- WHEN YOU COULD USE A SCALPEL -- APPROACH. BUT I UNDERSTAND THE THE REASON BEHIND IT AND THE MOTIVATION BEHIND IT. THE MEN'S RESTROOM IS. I THANK YOU SENATOR -- FOR FOR BRING THIS FORWARD -- I KNOW THAT. AT LEAST ON OUR SIDE THERE IS -- RECOMMENDATION IS IS AN OPPOSITION BUT I I UNDERSTAND THE NEED -- FOR IT BECAUSE OF THERE CERTAINLY IS NO DOUBT -- THAT OF VOTERS ARE CONFUSED WHEN THEY'RE REGISTERING TO VOTE AND A RIP BUT THEN THEY AND WHEN THEY REGISTER THAT THEY OFTEN TIMES -- THEY WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT AND SO THEY GO TO THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY -- THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT -- THERE'S THE REALLY THREE WORDS AND AN AMERICAN -- POLITICAL LEXICON IT'S YOUR DEMOCRATS YOUR REPUBLICAN OR YOU'RE NEITHER OF THEM YOU'RE AN INDEPENDENT AND OF COURSE THERE'S THE GREEN PARTY LIBERTARIAN PARTY. BUT WHEN PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY'RE INDEPENDENT. MAYBE THEY'RE INDEPENDENT SO THEY'RE GOING TO REGISTER TO VOTE AND THEY GO DOWN THE THE LIST OF OPTIONS THEY DON'T LOOK IT NO PARTY PREFERENCE THEY DON'T LOOK AT DECLINE TO STATE. BILL ACCORDS INDEPENDENT AT BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S WHO I WANT TO BE I WANT TO BE AN INDEPENDENT -- BUT NOT NECESSARILY ESTABLISHED WITH THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY I UNDERSTAND THAT -- I DO THINK THE BILL IS INCOMPLETE -- HOWEVER BECAUSE I FEEL AS THOUGH IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS THEN WE NEED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IF YOU'RE NEITHER A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN OR GO OR GREEN PARTY LIBERTARIAN. THE YOU ARE ACTUALLY AN INDEPENDENT YOU CAN CHECK A BOX IS INDEPENDENT I'M NOT DECLINE TO STATE AND NOTE FOR NOTE NO PARTY PREFERENCE AND I FEEL LIKE IF WE GO DOWN THIS ROAD WE SHOULD ADD THAT SO -- MAYBE WE CAN WORK ON THAT AND THE NEXT LEGISLATIVE SESSION -- BUT I THINK. THAT. USING THE TERM INDEPENDENT MAKES A MAKES SENSE -- AND THEN YOU KNOW TO THOSE WHO DON'T LIKE THE NAME CHANGE UNDERSTAND THE THE NAMES BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME BUT I'M LOOKING AT THE BILL -- ON PAGE. FOUR AND THEIR ONLINE -- SIX WILLIS DEADLINE FOR IT SAYS THE SECRETARY STATE SHALL NOTIFY EACH VOTER REGISTERED TO A PARTY DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION AS FOLLOWS. AND THEN IT SAYS IF THE PARTY LAWFULLY CHANGES ITS NAME AS PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION AND NOTICE SHALL BE SENT INFORMING THE VOTER OF THE PARTIES NEW NAME. THAT THE VOTER SHALL CONTINUE TO BE REGISTERED TO THE PARTY BUT UNDER THE NEW NAME. AND SO FOR THIS IDEA THAT SOME ALL MY GOSH PEOPLE AREN'T GOING TO REGISTER FROM THAT'S NOT TRUE PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY REGISTERED AS AN AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY THEY'LL CONTINUE. TO BE REGISTERED UNDER THE NEW NAME OF THE PARTY SO WON'T HARM HARM THEM NOW OF COURSE AFTERWARDS THEY LOOK AT IT AWAY I'M NOT REGISTERED TO THAT AND THEY CAN DECIDE. TO CHANGE SO I THINK THAT'S CRAFTED WELL I JUST THINK IT'S INCOMPLETE -- I THINK -- WE NEED TO TO TO BRING BACK THAT TERM INDEPENDENT HAS SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BE PART OF OF OF ANY OF THE OF THE PARTY. OR ANY OF THE PARTIES -- AND MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR I DON'T LIKE IN PP I DON'T LIKE THE T. S. IN THESE COULD BE NEEDS TO BE INDEPENDENT. THEY MUST MAYES CALDERON. THANK YOU AND I AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS MISTER MAYES WHEN IT COMES RESPECT OF THIS ISSUE I COME FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE -- AS A MILLENNIAL AND UNDERSTANDING -- THE IMPACT OF THIS COULD HAVE ON FUTURE GENERATIONS I I DON'T THINK THIS IS NECESSARILY ISSUE OF PICKING. WINNERS LOSERS BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT PARTY PLATFORMS AND SEE THIS IS A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED ISSUE BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE A PRESIDENT OR NOT THIS IS MORE ABOUT CREATING A SYSTEM THAT'S CLEAR AND CONCISE. I'M OF THE OPINION I DO NOT. I DON'T LIKE THAT YOU HAVE IT'S NOT CLEAR YOU HAVE NO PARTY PREFERENCE DECLINE TO STATE AMERICAN AND IT'S YEAH IT'S NOT. SET CLEARLY IF I'M AN INDEPENDENT VOTER WHAT'S DAHLE I DO I DO AND YOU HAVE AN ENTIRE GENERATION THAT IS. IT EITHER. BEGINNING TO REGISTER TO VOTE HAS BEEN REGISTERED TO VOTE -- THAT THEY'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHERE THEY FALL BUT WHAT THEY DO KNOW IS THAT THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY SIGNING UP TO BE A DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF BUYING ALL IN TO ONE PARTY. THEY DON'T WANT TO BE DEFINED BY HAVING A D. BY THEIR NAME OR BY HAVING AN ARE BY THEIR NAME BECAUSE THEY DON'T SUBSCRIBE ENTIRELY. TO WHAT EITHER OF THOSE PARTIES REPRESENT THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES. OKAY HERE'S A CANDIDATE THIS IS WHAT THEY STAND FOR THIS IS WHAT THEY REPRESENT AND THAT'S HOW THIS IS HOW IT ALIGNS WITH MY VALUES IS NOT THAT THEY'RE DEMOCRAT OR THE REPUBLICAN WHICH IS WHY I'M GONNA VOTE FOR THEM. IT'S WHO THEY ARE AS THE PRESENT PERSON WHAT THEY BRING TO GOVERNMENT THE KIND OF CHANGE IN THE IDEAS THAT THEY SUPPORT THAT I SUPPORT I WANT TO SUPPORT THAT INDIVIDUAL. AND SELL THEIR NEEDS IT NEEDS TO BE CLEAR. WHEN I SIGN UP AND I WANT TO BE AN INDEPENDENT? IT'S NOT CLEAR. BECAUSE I HAVE TOO MANY OPTIONS THE LABEL ME AN INDEPENDENT. BUT WHEN I TAUGHT WHEN I LISTEN TO REGARDLESS OF ITS FOX NEWS. CNN MSNBC ALL OF THEM THERE ARE THREE PARTIES THERE THERE ARE THREE CLASSIFICATIONS DEMOCRAT REPUBLICAN OR INDEPENDENT. THERE'S NOT DECLINE TO STATE NO PARTY PREFERENCE OR ANYBODY ELSE AND SO THERE NEED TO BE MORE CLARITY ON THIS ISSUE. SO THAT WE ARE NOT RUNNING INTO AN ISSUE WHERE WE ARE. OUR OUR HAVING PEOPLE THAT ARE SIGNING UP. FOR SPECIFIC PARTIES THAT HAVE CERTAIN PLATFORMS. REGARDLESS OF THIS BORDER NOT -- THAT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SIGNING UP FOR AND WHAT THE THEY THEY THINK IT'S ONE THING WHEN THEY'RE TIGHT WHAT WHEN THEY'RE THEY'RE SIGNING UP FOR SOMETHING ELSE. AND SO -- WHEN IT COMES OF THIS ISSUE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE CLARITY AND I I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON ON THAT ISSUE MAYBE WE ADD THAT IN -- AND CONTINUE TO IN A WORK WITH OPPOSITION ANYWAY THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN BUT AT THIS TIME I I DO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND I'M GONNA. MAKE A MOTION THANK YOU ALSO WILL BE A MOTION. IN VERSE SECOND. WE HAVE A SECOND THANK YOU IT'S JUST. AND JUST WANT. TO CLARIFY THAT THERE AMENDMENTS TO ADD AN URGENCY BECAUSE AND THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE DIESEL IN COMMON FOR ONE OF THE ANALYSIS. ANY DIGITAL FROM COLLEAGUES THAT WEBER. I WANT TO THANK. WITH SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- I ASKED A COUPLE PEOPLE THAT I KNOW WHO BELIEVE THEIR INDEPENDENT WHO SIGNED UP FOR THIS AND NONE OF THEM HAD EVER READ ANYTHING ABOUT IT IS A FAIRLY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE. AND WHEN THEY READ IT THEY SAID THIS IS NOT WHAT I STAND FOR IN TERMS OF A PARTY. AND I I WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY I THINK TO MAKE THINGS VERY CLEAR -- TO INDIVIDUALS AND NOT TO DECEIVE THEM WE'VE BEEN ON THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF TRANSPARENCY AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT -- THAT WE MAKE THINGS AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE SO PEOPLE CAN CHOOSE WHAT THEY REALLY BELIEVE. AND AND WHAT THEY REALLY WANT TO BE A PART OF AND SOME FOLKS WHO ARE VERY DISGUSTED WITH ALL PARTIES WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT. AND THEY THINK THEY ARE WHEN THEY SIGN UP FOR THIS THEY THEY THINK THEY ARE AND THEN THEY REPEAT WHAT THE PARTIES ABOUT AN OUT STARTED AND GEORGE WALLACE IN AUSTIN AGO GOD NO THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M ABOUT AND I SAID BUT THAT'S WHAT YOU SIGNED UP. FOR SO I THINK IT IT REALLY IS -- YOU KNOW IT SOUNDS DIFFICULT TO TO HAVE TO GO AND DO THIS BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU REALLY. JUST KNOWING HOW FOLKS ARE AND WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT YOU HEAR THE TERM INDEPENDENT AND AND AND AND MANY OF THEM AND WEEKS WE'VE OURSELVES OF CONFUSE PEOPLE WITH THIS OPEN PRIMARY THAT ISN'T REALLY OPEN. AND ALL THOSE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS THAT PEOPLE GET REALLY CONFUSED AND THEY THEN THEY GET FRUSTRATED WHEN THEY TRY TO VOTE. OF FOR PARTICULAR PARTY OR FILL OUT A FORM AND DISCOVER THAT THEY CAN'T VOTE BECAUSE THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT THEY DIDN'T THINK THEY WERE IN A PARTY BUT THEY WERE BEING INDEPENDENT AND THEY COULD VOTE REPUBLICAN A DEMOCRAT. IN THE PRIMARY NOW THEY CAN'T AND THEY'RE FRUSTRATED AS IF WE'VE CONDOM AND AS A RESULT THEY LOSE ALL KINDS OF INTEREST IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS. BECAUSE THEY FEEL DECEIVED SO I THINK IS IS MANY THINGS WE CAN DO TO TRY TO CREATE CLARITY FOR VOTERS TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THERE IS NO. UNDERLYING. MOTIVE IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS TO SHIP THEM INTO A CERTAIN DIRECTION THE BETTER WE ARE AND OF THE FEW PEOPLE I ASKED ABOUT THIS WHO. LOOKED AT IT IT AND FELT THAT THEY HAD BEEN TO SEE THAT THEY HAD SIGNED UP WITH SOMETHING THAT THEY TRULY WERE FAR FAR AWAY FROM. IN TERMS OF THEIR OWN POLITICS AND HAD NO IDEA THAT THERE REALLY WAS A PARTY THEY LOOK FOR INDEPENDENT THEY WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT AND THEY DID THAT. AND SO I THINK WE HAVE TO DO WHAT WE CAN TO CLARIFY TO MAKE SURE THAT VOTERS ACTUALLY SIGNING OF WHAT THEY WANT. AND AND DO THAT I THINK ALSO WE WE NEED TO MOVE ALSO IS POOR SOMEONE POINTED OUT TO A CATEGORY OF INDEPENDENT SO PEOPLE CAN JUST SEE THAT UP FRONT RATHER THAN HAVING. TO KIND OF WAIT THE WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF TO FIND IT BUT THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION -- I APPRECIATE THE RESEARCH HAS FINALLY BEEN DONE THAT MOST OF THIS KIND OF KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BUT IT'S NOW CODIFIED AND AND HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS REALLY CONFUSING. TO PEOPLE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU DOCTOR EVER DONE. CALDERON AND IT MADE MAYBE PART OF THE CONSIDERATION IS RATHER THAN TAKING PARTIES LIKE THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY ELIMINATING INDEPENDENT BECAUSE IT'S THE CAUSES CONFUSION IT'S JUST. GETTING RID OF NOT DECLINE TO STATE NO PARTY PREFERENCE IN CREATING AN INDEPENDENT PARTY. AND THEN IT WOULD STAND NEXT TO AMERICAN INDEPENDENT THAT'S JUST A SUGGESTION BUT I HOPE YOU CONSIDER. CHOOSE WHICHEVER BERMAN -- YES I APOLOGIZE SIR WE WE WE DON'T HAVE A A BACK AND FORTH WITH FOLKS YEAH IN LESS AND LESS THE QUESTION GETS ASKED THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM COLLEAGUES. WE GOT A COUPLE ALL RIGHT ROUND DO I WILL I WILL DECIDE AND HOW OLD IS AND YOU KNOW WITH. ASK YOURSELF THIS QUESTION HOW MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE REGISTERED RIGHT NOW AS REPUBLICAN OR DEMOCRAT. TRULY KNOW AND HAVE READ THE PLATFORM OF BOTH OF THOSE PARTIES. AND KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT IT AND AND AND MAYBE ONLY REGISTERED THAT WAY BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS ARE REGISTERED THAT WHERE FOR WHATEVER REASON -- DON'T TRULY HAVE AN INFORMED KNOWLEDGE OF WHY THEY'RE REGISTERED -- YOU KNOW THAT WAY HOW IS THAT ANY DIFFERENT. FROM THE SITUATION YOU KNOW OR THAT THINK THAT MAYBE DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEANS. I SUPPORT DEMOCRACY OR A REPUBLICAN PARTY MEANS I SUPPORT REPUBLICAN FORMER GOVERNOR YEAH I MEAN. YOU CAN MAKE THESE ARGUMENTS ABOUT ANY NUMBER OF THOSE THINGS AND SO. IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE ONLY YOU'RE ONLY PICKING ON ONE PARTY. AND AND EVENTUALLY LIKE THAT'S GONNA NOT PASS CONSTITUTIONAL MUSTER PERIOD HE WAS RIGHT THERE IN A MISTER MAYES AND THEN DOCTOR WEBER MOTHER HAD A FOLLOW UP. OR OR OR NOT OR OR MAYBE THEY'LL BE FOR AFTER THE HEARING I KNOW THAT THIS BILL IS IN ITS SECOND HOUSE SO IN REGARDS TO MENDING IT -- YOU KNOW SOMETIMES THE THAT THAT CAN BE DIFFICULT I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS GOING TO APPROPRIATIONS ORIFICE JUDGES COME TO COMING TO THE FLOOR BUT I WONDER IF THE SENATOR WOULD BE OPEN -- TO I THINK MISTER CALDERON RIGHT KIND OF ON THE SAME -- SABLE SAME WAVELENGTH HERE IN REGARDS TO THE LET'S LET'S CALL AN INDEPENDENT INDEPENDENT WHEN SOMEBODY GOES THE BAT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT WOULD BE A PARTY BUT IF THEY WANTED TO REGISTER AS AN INDEPENDENT. LET'S CALL IT -- THAT WOULD YOU WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO TO TO HAVING SOME CONVERSATIONS IN TRYING TO CREATE SOME SOME CLARITY SO. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MAYES AB AS MISTER JONES. A NOTED TO US THE OTHER DAY I HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS JUST RECENTLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND TWO THOUSAND SIX I HAVE A BILL DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU SUGGESTED -- IT FAILED -- BUT YOUR YOUR SUGGESTION IS WILL TAKE IT UP IN IN MY CLOTHES ALL ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE BUT NO I I THINK THAT'S RIGHT I THINK THAT. IT WOULD BE. A BETTER. TO HAVE DECLINED THE STATE'S REGISTER AS INDEPENDENCE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK THEY ARE -- INTO WHETHER IT GETS. INCORPORATED INTO THIS AWARE THAT'S ANOTHER SEPARATE EFFORT THAT SOMETHING WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER. IN AND THE BILL WILL GO TO APPROPRIATIONS AS FOR FOR CLARIFICATION. NOT MAYBE MISTER KALRA HAVE SOMETHING NEXT YEAR THEY ARE RARE. BILLS READY I MEAN WE JUST HAVE TO PULL OF THE ARCHIVES THE RIGHT. SET UP IT'S BEEN WRITTEN NEW MODEL NUMBER. THE I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAD ARCHIVES THAT BUT THANK YOU -- ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COLLEAGUES -- CENTER EMBER YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS IN AND LET ME -- INCORPORATING ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH THE WITH THE COMMENTS OF OF VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WITH RESPECT TO THE NEED FOR THE BILL HERE'S HERE'S WHAT WE NOW. WE KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE REGISTERED AS AN AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY MEMBER YOU CANNOT VOTE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY HOWEVER IF YOU ARE. A DECLINE TO STATE WHICH MOST PEOPLE TRADITIONALLY THINK OF AS AN INDEPENDENT YOU CAN'T WHETHER REPUBLICAN PARTY PERMITS THAT ARE NOT. THAT'S A SEPARATE QUESTION BUT THEY MAY WELL. ADOPT THE SAME RULES AS THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WHICH AGAIN WOULD PRECLUDE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY MEMBER FROM VOTING IN THE REPUBLICAN PRIMARY SO WE KNOW THAT. THAT EXISTS TODAY WE ALSO KNOW THE EVIDENCE IS OVERWHELMING THAT THOSE WHO ARE REGISTERED THE AS AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE -- IN LARGE PART OBVIOUSLY NOT ALL BUT LARGE PART REGISTERED BECAUSE THEY TRULY WANTED TO BE. INDEPENDENT OF THE QUESTION RAISED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER GALLAGHER IS TO WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST I OBVIOUSLY DO BELIEVE IT'S A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST I THINK THAT THE EVIDENCE WILL DEMONSTRATE THAT IT'S A COMPELLING. STATE INTEREST TO ENSURE THAT VOTERS ARE NOT DECEIVED IN SO THAT VOTERS CAN FULLY EXERCISE THEIR FRANCHISE -- IN IN THE UPCOMING ELECTION AND IN FUTURE ELECTIONS -- BUT I SUPPOSE REASONABLE MINDS MIGHT DIFFER -- AND IF IF IT DOES GO TO THE COURT HI I THINK THAT. ON BALANCE THE COURT WILL FIND THAT THERE IS A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST IN IN. PREVENTING SORT OF OF OBVIOUS AN INTENTIONAL VOTER CONFUSION. SO HAVING SAID THAT I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. THE CENTER -- WHILE AND WELL IT IS A SIGNIFICANT STEP TO REQUIRE POLITICAL PARTY TO CHANGES NAME. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF VOTERS WHO DO NOT WANT TO BE AFFILIATED WITH POLITICAL PARTIES ARE MISTAKENLY REGISTERING WITH THE AMERICAN INDEPENDENT PARTY. AND THAT MISTAKE CAN PREVENT VOTERS FROM BEING ABLE TO VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE OF THEIR CHOICE WHICH I AGREE IS A COMPELLING STATE INTEREST -- SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL WITH A PROPOSED AUTHORS AMENDMENTS THAT ADD AN URGENCY CLAUSE TO THE BILL MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN HI BERMAN AYE AYE GALLAGHER. GALLAGHER NO CALDERON. CALDERON I LOW. WELL I MAYES. MAYES ON A MULLIN. MULLIN AYE WEBER. THE BILL IS OUT WITH FIVE VOTES WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN TRAPS AND MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. GEN THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. I SEE CENTER WIENER IN THE CROWD YOU'VE GOT TO ITEM SIR ADAM FOUR ADAM. FIVE SB TWO SIXTY EIGHT IN TWO EIGHTY EIGHT WE ARE YOU GUYS SO [inaudible] YEAH -- WE HAVE A OKAY BUT WAY SHOULD OF AND SO -- FIRST I'M HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE TECHNICAL IN THE OR THE AMENDMENTS LISTED IN THE ANALYSIS -- IN ADDITION -- WE'VE REACHED A FURTHER -- AGREEMENT -- ANOTHER MOMENT THAT I WILL ACCEPT -- AND THAT WILL CHANGE IN THE BILL INSTEAD OF REQUIRING THAT THE BALLOT LABEL STATE QUOTE SEE VOTER GUIDE FOR INFORMATION. INSTEAD IT WILL STATE QUOTE SEE VOTER GUIDE FOR TAX RATES INFORMATION AND QUOTE SO -- THAT MEMINTA THE ANALYSIS AND DOT AMENDMENT WERE HAPPY -- TO EXCEPT AND AGAIN WE THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH US -- BECAUSE THIS SONG LEGISLATION IT ARISES OUT OF TWO PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED IN. TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN WITH THE STATED GOAL OF INCREASING TRANSPARENCY FOR BONDS AND PARCEL TAX MEASURES. REQUIRING THAT IN THE SEVENTY FIVE WORD OP BALLOT QUESTION ABOUT LABEL -- DIE CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT -- TAX RATES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE INCLUDED -- WHILE THIS APPROACH MAKES SENSE FOR A VERY SIMPLE TAXES SUCH AS SALES TAX OR A STRAIGHT UP -- PARCEL TAX WITH ONLY ONE RATE WITH NO EXEMPTIONS -- FOR BONDS OR FOR MORE COMPLICATED PARCEL TAXES -- IT DOESN'T WORK AND SO FOR EXAMPLE. HI OF RIGHT NOW I HAVE A PURE -- A MULTI TIER PARCEL TAX -- AND WE FREQUENTLY HAVE PARCEL TAXES WHERE FOR EXAMPLE COMMERCIAL MIGHT PAY MORE THAN RESIDENTIAL OR MIGHT BE TIERED BASED ON THE SIZE OF A PROPERTY OR THE VALUE OF PRO OR THE OR OTHER -- FACTORS OR YOU MIGHT HAVE A SENIOR EXEMPTION OR A LOW INCOME EXEMPTION -- AND UNDER THE LAW AS IT IS NOW FOR A PARCEL TAX IN THAT SEVENTY FIVE WORDS YOU HAVE. TO YOU HAVE TO DESCRIBE EVERY SINGLE TEAR -- AND WHEN YOU HAVE MORE THAN ONE TEAR. ON IT BECOMES PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIT IT WITH IN SEVENTY FIVE WORDS THIS IS ONE OF PARTICULAR -- PARTIAL TAX QUESTION. AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IS WE HAVE BEEN IN BLACK UP TO THOSE SEVENTY FIVE WORDS AND AFTER SEVENTY FIVE WORDS IT'S GREAT OUT. YOU CAN SEE THAT UNDER THE LAWS THAT WE PASS TWENTY FIFTEEN SEVENTEEN THIS PARCEL TAX WOULD EFFECTIVELY BECOME ILLEGAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND WEBELIEVE THE OVERWHELMINGLY TIERED PARCEL TAXES EVEN SIMPLE ONES OUT PROVIDE ONE OR TWO EXEMPTIONS TO SENIOR TO LOW INCOME PEOPLE. OUGHT WOULD EFFECTIVELY BE PROHIBITED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD AND FORCE US TO HAVE MORE REGRESSIVE TAXATION BECAUSE THE ONLY KIND OF PARCEL TAX YOU COULD EVER DO. IS A FLAT PARCEL TAX THAT EVERYONE PAYS THE SAME THE MATTER HOW RICH OR POOR WEATHER A BIG COMMERCIAL BUILDING OR A SINGLE FAMILY HOME. ALSO ON PARTS YOUR PARCEL TAXES THE THE THE LEGISLATION EFFECTIVELY BANS ON ONE BONDS -- THE IT ALSO CREATES SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS FIRST OF ALL IT REQUIRES A LOT OF ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE THAT TAKES AWAY FROM THE SEVENTY FIVE OR A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE BOND ACTUALLY DIES AND MAKES IT A LOT HARDER -- FOR CITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DESCRIBE WHAT THE BOND DOES AN ACCURATE WAY. IT ALSO CREATES SIGNIFICANT CONFUSION BECAUSE YOUR OUGHT WE KNOW THAT IN TERMS OF THE TAX IMPACT OF BONDS YOU CAN'T PREDICT WHAT IT IS WHEN YOU GO TO THE BALLOT. IT DEPENDS ON WHAT THE INTEREST RATE IS A TIME FOR EXAMPLE AND SO IT DEPENDS ON WHEN THE BOND IS SOLD IN A BOND CAN BE SOLD YEARS. AFTER THE VOTERS ACTUALLY AUTHORIZED THE BOND AND SO WHAT THAT FORCES AUG CITIES TO DO IS TO LIST EITHER A BLINDING OR AN AVERAGE -- RANGE AS VERY SPECULATIVE AND MISLEADING TO THE VOTERS THE GOAL HERE IS TRANSPARENCY. AT A AT A FORCES CITIES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE WILL PAY ON BONDS. THAT MAY NOT PERTAIN TO THAT PARTICULAR. PERSON THIS IS ALL WITHIN THE SEVENTY FIVE WORDS WE KNOW THAT IN -- TWENTY EIGHTEEN IN TERMS OF STATEWIDE THE PERCENTAGES ON THESE BONDS IMPARTIAL TAXES WENT DOWN AND WE BELIEVE IT WAS A REAL AS A RESULT OF OF THIS CHANGE WE MAKE IT EXCEPTIONALLY HARD. IN CALIFORNIA FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO RAISE REVENUE. WE THEY OVERWHELMINGLY HAVE TO GET A TWO THIRDS VOTE ON BONDS WITH THE EXCEPTION SCHOOL FACILITIES. A AND ON PARCEL TAXES TWO THIRDS VOTE IS A VERY VERY HIGH THRESHOLD ALREADY AND WE SEE THE CONSEQUENCES OF HEALTH HARDLY MAKE IT FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. IN THAT THE FUNDING OF LOCAL CRITICAL SERVICES THAT FIRE STATIONS THAT CLOSE LIBRARY THIS NUMBER OF CITIES OF SCALE BACK OR ELIMINATED THEIR LIBRARY SYSTEMS. ROAD PAVING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. THERE'S SO MUCH THAT WE EXPECT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND WE MADE IT HARD AND WE MADE IT MUCH. HARDER EVEN HARDER WITH THESE TWO LAWS -- SO WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO IS -- INSTEAD OF REQUIRE ALL THAT IN THE SEVENTY FIVE WORDS TO PUT IT INTO THE VOTER HANDBOOK WITHOUT INDICATION -- AS AMENDED PER -- OF THE GREEN WITH THE COMMITTEE SO THE VOTERS KNOW IF YOU WANT AND FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT TAX IMPACTS. WHEN YOU GO TO THE VOTER GUIDE? I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR OF THE TWENTY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN LAWS THAT CONSIDER HIM A FRIEND I RESPECT HIM GREATLY WE HAVE CO AUTHORED BILLS TOGETHER -- WE SAT DOWN WE TALKED ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR -- BILL AND IT'S NEVER COMFORTABLE -- TO TRY -- TO CHANGE -- REPEAL A BILL THAT A COLLEAGUE A RESPECTED COLLEAGUE -- HAS A AUTHORED BUT I THINK HERE -- WE NEED TO DO THIS US OF THAT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. CAN ACTUALLY OP FUND THEMSELVES -- AND I THINK THAT THE RESOLUTION REACH WITH THE COMMITTEE IS A GOOD ONE USES THE WORD TAX IT'S RIGHT AND THEIR IN ADDITION TO IT PROBABLY WILL BE LISTED AS A PARCEL TAX AT THE BEGINNING OF IT AS A PARCEL TAX. SO I THINK THAT THE TRANSPARENCY -- IS MAINTAINED -- AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE WITH ME TODAY ARTS HIS IDEAS FROM THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL OF REBEKAH CURLY FROM THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE ON ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING. AND ANTHONY TANNER HILL FROM THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION THANK YOU THE CENTER WITNESSES. AND AND JUST A QUICK REMINDER WE'RE GONNA ADD TWO MINUTES PER WITNESS. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS REBEKAH CURLY ON BEHALF OF THE COALITION FOR ADEQUATE SCHOOL HOUSING HERE TODAY AND SUPPORT. LOCAL BONDS ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF REVENUE TO CONSTRUCT REPAIR AND UPGRADE SCHOOL FACILITIES. EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA DESERVES A CLEAN SAFE SCHOOL PER OUR CONSTITUTION -- IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE COMMUNICATE CLEARLY AND ACCURATELY WITH OUR COMMUNITIES LOCAL BONDS ARE COVENANTS BETWEEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND OUR COMMUNITIES. AND ABSENT TRUST BETWEEN THESE TWO WE WON'T BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR BOND PROGRAMS AND TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF OUR COMMUNITIES. RECENT CHANGES TO THE ELECTIONS COULD MAKE IT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOLS ESPECIALLY LOW WEALTH DISTRACTS. TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS HOUSE STUDENTS WERE ESPECIALLY CONCERNED BY THE A FAX THAT THE RECENT CHANGES HAVE ON DISTRICTS ABOUT A DEMONSTRATED HISTORY OF SUPPORTING LOCAL BONDS. FOR LOCAL BONDS AS THE SENATOR DESCRIBED THE RATE CHARGED TO PAY PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS DOES CHANGE ANNUALLY BASED ON ECONOMIC FACTORS SUCH AS INTEREST RATES AND PROPERTY VALUES. IN ONE EXAMPLE WE HAD A SCHOOL WITH A RATE OF NINETEEN DOLLARS PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ASSESSED VALUATION IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE THEN THE GREAT RECESSION HIT OUR PROPERTY VALUES TANKS AND THEY HAD TO RAISE THAT RATE. TO SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS THE VERY NEXT YEAR AND TWENTY TIMES YOU CAN SEE IT'S A REALLY WIDE SPREAD AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE THOUGHT TO VOTERS. ON THE SEVENTY FIVE FOR A BALLOT STATEMENT. THE ABOUT THAT WE REYES ANNUALLY. THE AMOUNT OF THE DURATION WILL ALSO FLUCTUATE. THE BOTTOM LINE OF ALL OF THIS IS THAT THE INFORMATION DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR LOCAL BONDS AND WE DON'T HAVE SPACE ON THAT SEVENTY FIVE OR BALLOTS STATEMENT TO MAKE THE DETAILED EXPLANATION. THE COST OF THIS IS VOTER CONFUSION WHEN VOTERS ARE CONFUSED THE TO VOTE NOW AND EVEN IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE SUPPORTED WHEN THEY HAD BETTER INFORMATION REGARDING THEIR SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCE. LOCAL BONDS ALREADY PROVIDE DETAILED TAX RATE INFORMATION AND THE VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE IN THE REQUIRED TAX RATE STATEMENTS. THIS IS THE PLACE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY AN EXPLANATION REGARDING FACTORS SUCH AS WHY THE RATE MAY CHANGE PLEASE WRAP UP SB TWO SIXTY EIGHT AND HAVE SINCE TRANSPARENCY -- AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SURE MEMBER SAYS THAT IS ONLY HALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. OUR MEMBERS TO A BILL THAT MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE STATE BUT THERE BE SCHOOLS FOR FREEWAYS. OF PORTS I'M MORE OFTEN PARTNERS WITH OF THOSE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- OF TO PASS BONDS AND TO ADDRESS THEIR OF FINANCIAL NEEDS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE -- WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE BALLOT LABELS OF CURRENTLY ARE AFFECTING VOTER OF A GUIDANCE HERE ON THESE ISSUES. IN FACT I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE STATE ALLOCATION BOARD WHERE WE JUST APPROVED. A A SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT HAD GONE -- IT WAS BIG ACTUALLY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WOULD GONE TO THE BALLOT FOUR TIMES TO GET A LOCAL BOND MEASURE PASSED AND THEY WERE AFFECTED BY THE FIRE -- AND OF COURSE THIS STATE OCCASION BOARD WAS ABLE TO EXEMPT THE CURRENT REGULATIONS TO PROVIDE THEM THE NECESSARY FUNDING THAT THEY PROVIDED. BUT THEY HAD GONE OUT FOUR TIMES AND THEY RAN OUT AGAIN IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN OF THE VOTERS IN THAT AREA ARE VERY CONSERVATIVE -- THE BALLOT LABEL ALONE DID NOT ALLOW THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT ACTUALLY FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO THEIR TO THEIR STUDENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUT OF THE DEAL THAT HAS BEEN STRUCK THE BALANCE THE OLDER HAS BEEN STRUCK BY YOURSELF IN THE AND THE SENATOR AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT STILL ALLOWS VOTERS TO BE DIRECTED TO THE VOTER GUIDE I TO SEE INFORMATION THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE INFORMATION LIVES AND SHOULD BE. IT SHOULD NOT BE. AND THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE BECAUSE AND IT HINDERS THE ABILITY OF THAT VOTER TO ACTUALLY MAKING A GOOD AT A LOSS AS TO WHAT THE BALANCE NEED ARE FOR OR THE CRIME IS FOR THAT INFRASTRUCTURE -- NECESSITY SO FOR THOSE REASONS -- IN A WEEK WE DO WANT TO EXPRESS -- OUR REGRETS FOR MISSING. TWICE THE THAT MISTER OBERNOLTE IS BILL AND FULL OF TIP MY HAT OFF TO HIM BECAUSE IT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE THAT HE GOT THIS DONE BUT WE DO SEE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING ASSUMING BEFORE THE FOR THOSE REASONS WE URGE SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT ONE IS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE I ANTHONY TANNER HOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION. OUT WE HAVE WE HAVE OVER A THOUSAND MEMBERS OF PROVIDE. KEY LOCAL SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. RANGING FROM HEALTHCARE AND AND LIBRARIES AND CEMETERIES TO FIRES SUPPRESSION PROTECTION WATER AND OTHER SANITATION. AND WERE WERE EXCITED THAT THIS IS BEING A DRASTIC COMMAND ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS. FOR OUR AND AND THE COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIR. FOR PUTTING THOUGH THE WORKING TIME AND BECAUSE AS YOU'VE HEARD THIS IS CAUSED. SOME SOME DILEMMAS IN THE ABILITY TO TO TO FIND THE REVENUES AND RAISE THE FINANCES TO PROVIDE THESE. CRITICAL. HYPER LOCAL SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE -- YOU HEARD ABOUT THE THE TEAR TAX RATES. OF WHICH COULD BE. PREFERENTIAL FOR AN ENTERPRISE ZONE OR AGRICULTURAL LAND VERSUS RESIDENTIAL OR OTHER TYPES OF COMMERCIAL. AND WE JUST SIMPLY CAN'T FITTED ALMA. ON THE A BALLOT AS YOU SEE THERE WITH THE EXAMPLE. SO AS IT'S BEEN STATED -- BY BY MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE SENATOR -- THIS IS A GOOD MOVE FORWARD AND IT'S VITAL FOR US TO KEEP OUR OUR FINANCES STRAIGHT FOR LOCAL SERVICES. RIGHT THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF YOU PLEASE JUST GIVE YOUR NAME AND YOUR PHILLY ABSOLUTELY -- KEVIN FROM WORTH THE COP THE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. SEVENTY ONE WITH A CA YOU CALIFORNIA STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. NICCOLO DELUCA HERE BEHALF OF THE OAKLAND MAYOR AND STRONG SUPPORT AND NONPROFIT HOUSING OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT THANK YOU.

BART BROOME WITH SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT ALSO KNOWN AS VALLEY WATER IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. A STRANGE BE ON THE SIDE OF THE TABLE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THE LEGISLATION THAT THIS BILL SEEKS TO EXEMPTS THESE BOND ISSUANCES FROM WAS BUILT LEGISLATION THAT I AUTHORED IS AB EIGHT OH NINE ORIGINALLY AND THEN AB ONE NINETY FIVE SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE CLARIFIED. THAT THE TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS EXTENDED TO BOND ISSUANCES MY MOTIVATION FOR INTRODUCING THAT LEGISLATION WAS A STRONG FEELING THAT WE OUGHT TO BE TRANSPARENT WITH VOTERS WHEN THEY VOTE ON SOMETHING THAT INCREASES TAXES ON THE BALLOT. THAT IT IS INDEED A TAX INCREASE. AB ONE NINETY FIVE SEVERAL YEARS AGO PASSED UNANIMOUSLY IN BOTH CHAMBERS EVERY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE VOTED FOR IT. NOW I WILL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT THE LAST OF SOME OF THE CONCERNS OF BEEN RAISED BY THE SPONSOR HERE ARE COMPLETELY VALID -- I THINK THAT THE CHAIR TAX RATES FOR SOMETHING THAT SHOULD GO IN THE VOTER GUIDE -- I THINK THAT THE SAFE HAVEN THAT THEY PROPOSED FOR IF THEY'VE USED A GOOD FAITH ESTIMATE OF THINGS LIKE BONTA RATIONS -- BOND RATES THAT -- THEY OUGHT TO BE -- IS LONG AS THEY'VE ACTED IN GOOD FAITH IF THEY OUGHT TO BE -- PROTECTED AGAINST VALIDATION I WOULD AGREE WITH ALL OF THAT HOWEVER. I STILL THINK WE NEED TO TELL THE VOTERS THAT THEY'RE VOTING ON A TAX INCREASE AND THAT SEEMS TO BE WHAT THEY WANT TO AVOID DOING SO. IN THE YEARS SINCE AB ONE NINETY FIVE PASSED I HAVE TRIED TWICE TO WORK WITH THE SPONSOR. IN RECTIFYING THE SITUATION AND THEY HAVE OPPOSED MY LEGISLATION BOTH TIMES BECAUSE THE ONE THING I'M NOT WILLING TO DO. IS TO AVOID TELLING VOTERS THAT THEY'RE VOTING ON A TAX INCREASE. SO. I DON'T WANT TO VILIFY THE SPONSORS HERE REALIZE THAT THEY HAVE A JOB TO DO. AND THE THE REPRESENTING THEIR INTERESTS BUT WE HAVE A JOB TO DO TO IN OUR JOB IS TO BE THE FULCRUM BETWEEN SPECIAL INTERESTS ON ONE SIDE. AND TAXPAYER PROTECTION ON THE OTHER SIDE AND I DON'T THINK IT'S UNREASONABLE TO TELETEXT PLAYERS THAT THEY'RE VOTING ON A TAX INCREASE. SO TALKING ABOUT THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE OF THIS BILL. THIS BILL JUST REQUIRES THAT EVERYTHING GO IN THE VOTER GUIDE AND THAT THE ONLY THING ON THE BALLOT STATEMENT SAY AS AMENDED DOW. FIVE C.. VOTER GUIDE FOR TAX RATE INFORMATION RIGHT SO. YOU COULD SAY [inaudible] THIS MEASURE. IT REDUCES THE BOND THAT WERE CURE CANCER AND PROVIDE A FREE PUPPY FOR EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA. SEE VOTER GUIDE FOR TAX RATE INFORMATION I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S BEING TRANSPARENT. SOME SOLUTIONS THAT I HAVE OFFERED. WERE FIRST I OFFERED. I PUT EVERYTHING THE VOTER GUIDE AND LET'S SAY. THIS MEASURE INCREASES PROPERTY TAXES SEE VOTER GUIDE FOR INFORMATION. I WAS TOLD THAT NO YOU CAN'T SAY TAX INCREASE THAT THAT'S A NON STARTER. SO I SAID OKAY ABOUT THIS. THIS MEASURE AFFECTS TAX RATES SEE VOTER GUIDE FOR INFORMATION. AND THAT WAS REJECTED ALSO. YOU KNOW I THINK IT REALLY GOES TO THE MOTIVATION HERE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH UP. IF THIS SHOULD NOT PASSED TODAY AND I'M ASKING YOU TO EITHER VOTE NOR JUST TO LAY OFF A WE WORK THIS OUTI WILL PLEDGE TO TRY A THIRD TIME NEXT YEAR TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION THAT WILL ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE SPONSOR. BUT THE ONE THING THAT. I WILL NOT DO IS TO AGREE TO TRY AN OBSCURE FROM THE VOTER THE FACT THAT THERE ARE INDEED VOTING ON SOMETHING THAT WILL IN FACT. INCREASE TAXES AND I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD. TOO AND LASTLY I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP WHICH IS THE PERCEIVED DIFFICULTY OF PASSING. THESE BOND ISSUANCES ON THE BALLOT. THERE IS ANALYSIS HERE. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT YOU OF THAT -- YOU RECEIVED ON THIS BILL ALL OF THE MEASURES THAT WERE PROPOSED LAST YEAR. THAT PUT BOND INCREASES ON BALLOTS IN CALIFORNIA THERE WERE ALMOST FOUR HUNDRED OF THEM AND THE PASSAGERATE. WAS OVER 82%. SO I DON'T ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THIS IS PREVENTING OTHERWISE GOOD BOND ISSUANCES FROM PASSING AND IN FACT I THINK IF WE EVER GET TO A 100%. TAX PASSAGE RATE THAT THAT WOULD BE INDICATIVE OF A DIFFERENT PROBLEM SO I WOULD DOT URGE YOU TO EITHER VOTE NO OR LAY OFF AND GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK OUT SOMETHING THAT BALANCES THE NEED. TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITHIN RAISED WITH PROTECTION OF TAXPAYERS. THE MEASURE WANT OBERNOLTE. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS GOOD MORNING DAVID WILL FOR THE HOWARD JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION -- IN OPPOSITION AND FORTUNATELY DEBTS BE TWO SIXTY EIGHT MEMBERS OF MR WROTE -- OBERNOLTE MENTION WE DO HAVE A LONG AND STORIED HISTORY WITH THIS CODE SECTION WE WERE THE SPONSORS OF BOTH AB EIGHT OR NINE AND AB. ONE OH FIVE AND MEMBERS AS EVEN MISTER WERE NORTH YOU MENTION WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS INFORMATION CAN BE DIFFICULT TO LESS THAN A SEVENTY FIVE WORD ABOUT LABEL WE TO HAVE WORKED WITH CASH AND OTHERS. OVER MULTIPLE YEARS OUT OF RECOGNITION ON THIS PROBLEM TO TRY AND REACH SOME SORT OF AMENDMENT IN CONCLUSION THAT WOULD ACTUALLY WORK WHILE STILL PROVIDING INFORMATION TO TAXPAYERS AND AS MR WHEN OBERNOLTE MENTION OF COURSE -- THERE'S OVERTURES WERE REJECTED WE UNDERSTAND THINGS LIKE BONDS ARE SOLD IN SERIES AND AREN'T SOLD EVERY YEAR IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO GET THAT INFORMATION ON A SEVENTY FIVE OR A BALLOT LABEL. BUT AS THE ASSEMBLYMAN ALSO MENTIONED JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS DIFFICULT DOES NOT MEAN IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. CAL TAX -- AS THE SOME WOMEN MENTIONED NOTED THAT THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SEVEN OF THREE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT LOCAL TAX AND BOND MEASURES PLACED ON THE BALLOT IN THE LAST ELECTION CYCLE SINCE THESE BILLS A BAN IN PLACE WERE PROOF. THAT IS AN 82% PASSAGE RATE IT'S NOT AS IF THESE DON'T PASS WITH THAT REQUIRED TRANSPARENCY INFORMATION IN PLACE -- WE DO BELIEVE MEMBERS THAT THE INFORMATION SHOULD BE IN ABOUT LEVEL IN A MANNER THAT MAKES SENSE TO VOTERS. AND MAYBE LISTEN IF WE CAN EXPLAIN THE NUANCES OF A BOND MEASURE IN SEVENTY FIVE RATES MAYBE WE SHOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PORTS. MAYBE WE SHOULD LIMIT THE SEVENTY FIVE WORD BALLOT LABEL DIGEST THE RATE DURATION AND AMOUNT OF REVENUE TO BE RAISED AND SAVE ALL THE FLOWERY HEY THIS IS WHAT THE BINDING TAX GOES TO SUPPORT. PUT THAT SOMEWHERE ELSE. BECAUSE LISTEN THESE MEASURES ARE ON PROPERTY TAX BILLS THEY ARE INEFFECTIVE FOR ANYWHERE FROM TWENTY FIVE TO FORTY YEARS ALL OF YEAH ALL WE'RE SAYING IS THAT VOTERS DESERVE TO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE VOTING ON I ASK FOR NOVA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRING BACK TO COLLEAGUES FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS -- I'VE GOT MISTER MULLIN MISTER CALDERON. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR BRINGING THE BILL I KNOW YOU. HAVE HAD EXTENSIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH MISTER OBERNOLTE MISTER OBERNOLTE AND KNOW THAT YOU WILL HAVE A REAL PASSION FOR THIS ISSUE ROUND TRANSPARENCY AND DISCLOSURE. SO. AND YOU AND I WERE EXCHANGING INFORMATION LAST NIGHT AS A MATTER OF FACT BUT FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND. YOU'RE ADVOCATING. FOR LANGUAGE THAT SAYS THIS MEASURE AFFECTS TAX RATES SEE VOTER GUIDE FOR INFORMATION AND WE'VE LANDED ON SEE VOTER GUIDE FOR TAX RATE INFORMATION. I THINK THAT'S A REASONABLE. APPROXIMATION OF WHAT YOU'RE ADVOCATING FOR MY QUESTION IS AROUND. THE SUGGESTION THAT A VOTER WOULD NOT HAVE ANY SENSE THAT THEY'RE VOTING ON A PARCEL TAX AT ALL. IN THAT THE DESCRIPTION HERE WHICH TO ME LOOKS LIKE A FAIRLY COMMON DESCRIPTION IN THE DESCRIPTION ITSELF IT SAYS RENEW AN EXPIRING PARCEL TAX. I THINK JUST ON THE NATURAL THESE FISCAL MEASURES THAT GO BEFORE VOTERS WILL INDICATE THAT THERE IS A TAX IN PLAY. THAT THERE IS A QUESTION BEFORE THE VOTERS REGARDING A NEW TAX OR RENEWAL OF EXPIRING TAX. BUT FOR THAT DETAILED INFORMATION GO TO THE VOTER GUIDE. TO ME THAT MEETS THE THRESHOLD FOR TRANSPARENCY. AND DISCLOSURE THAT A VOTER IS IN FACT VOTING ON A TAX AND IF THEY WANT DETAILED INFORMATION TO GO TO THE VOTER GUIDE SO I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR ENGAGEMENT ON THIS I THINK IT'S A REASONABLE -- AMENDMENT -- THAT THE AUTHOR IS WILLING TO TAKE IN WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. I'M JUST CURIOUS. MR VERNAL TO SUGGESTION THIS MEASURE AFFECTS TAX RATES. WHY WAS UNACCEPTABLE? SO IT MAY OR MAY NOT BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU ARE RENEWING AN EXISTING PARCEL TAX AND NOT INCREASING AND MIGHT BE EXACTLY THE SAME OR COULD EVEN BE LOWER -- YOU'RE NOT A IT'S NOT A FACTOR BUT WELL IT'S LOWERING YES THAT AFFECTS OF BUT IF YOU'RE JUST RENEWING AN EXISTING ONE NOT CHANGE YET IT DOESN'T AFFECTED. IN ADDITION FOR BONDS. DIFFERENT CITIES HAVE DIFFERENT POLICIES FOR EXAMPLE -- IN SAN FRANCISCO WE HAVE A BINDING POLICY THAT WE DO NOT ISSUE. NEW EVEN IF VOTERS COMMEMORATIVE VOTERS APPROVE A BOND. THOSE BONDS DON'T EVER HAVE TO BE ISSUED RIGHT OF DID THE VOTER APPROVAL SIMPLY AUTHORIZES THE SALE OF THE BONDS AND THE BONDS ARE NEVER SOLD WHICH OCCASIONALLY DOES HAPPEN. THAN NOT BEEN THERE'S NO IMPACT ON ANYTHING SO SOMETIMES YOU HAVE A BOND IT'S AUTHORIZED AND THEN EITHER IT'S ONLY PARTIALLY SOLD OR NOT SOLD AT ALL. AND SOMETIMES I'LL EXAMINE CISCO WE HAVE A POLICY THAT WE DO NOT SELL AND ISSUE A NEW BOND. UNLESS WE ARE RETIRING AND EQUIVALENT BOND -- AND SO IT DOES NOT AFFECT PEOPLE'S TAX RATES AT ALL IN THE TO POLICY THE CITY I I'M I DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHER CITIES THAT DO THAT I BELIEVE THERE ARE -- SO THAT'S WHY -- USING THE WORD A FAX IT WE THINK IS MISLEADING. I THINK IT'S BETTER TO TO SAY FOR TAX INFORMATION AND MAKES IT CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT THE TAX APPLIES HERE -- TAX INFORMATION SEE THE VOTER HANDBOOK AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW THE ARGUMENT IS THAT WILL NOT EVERYONE GOES AND READ THE VOTER HANDBOOK BUT THE WHOLE POINT OF THE VOTER HABITATS WE PUT THE TAXED. OF OF BALLOT MEASURES WE PUT ALL SORTS OF INFORMATION IN THERE SO THE PEOPLE CAN ACCESS THAT INFORMATION WE CAN'T FORCE PEOPLE. TO DO IT BUT BUT THEY SAY THAT BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING TO READ THE HANDBOOK. WE SHOULD THEREFORE BE PUTTING ALL THIS INFORMATION IN THE SEVENTY FIVE WORDS IN EITHER CREATE AN OUTRAGEOUS SITUATION LIKE THIS OR A SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE JUST MAKING AN EXCEPTION HARD TO EVEN DESCRIBE A SIMPLE MEASURE. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S A SOLUTION I THINK THIS IS A GOOD ACCOMMODATION THE METAL. THANK YOU SENATE I'M AS MR OVER MULTI I'M JUST. I'M JUST CURIOUS YOU KNOW WHEN IT COMES -- TO WHEN MY COLLEAGUE MISTER MALL AND JUST SAID SEEMS LIKE THE COMPROMISE IS WORKED OUT BY THE CHAIR IN THIS COMMITTEE IS RELATIVELY CLOSE TO WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR SEE VOTER GUIDE FOR TAX RATE INFORMATION. AGAIN JUST GOING TO LOVE IT WHY IS THAT NOT SUFFICIENT WHY DOES IT HAVE TO INCREASE WISE HAVE TO BE AFFECTS WHAT YOU KNOW WHY IT WHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ISN'T CLEAR ENOUGH FOR VOTERS. TO REASONABLY DISCERN THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME TYPE OF IMPACT -- TO A TAX RATE OR TO TAXES BY BY THE PASSAGE OF THAT THAT OF THAT MEASURE. I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT THE VOTER RECOGNIZE THAT THERE'S GOOD AND BAD IN THE PROPOSITION. THE GOOD IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO ISSUE BONDS AND DO ALL OF THIS GOOD STUFF BUILT A FIRE STATION OR WHATEVER IT IS AND THE BAD IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO INCREASE PROPERTY TAXES TO DO IT. SO IF YOU JUST SAY SEE VOTER GUIDE FOR TAX RATE INFORMATION DOESN'T CONVEY THE IMPRESSION THAT THERE IS A PRICE TO BE PAID -- SO THAT'S WHY I DON'T THINK IT'S UNREASONABLE TO SAY AFFECTS TAX RATES. AND OF THE AUTHORED I HAD A DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS OF MY RESPONSE TO THE CRITICISM OF WELL SOME OF THEM DON'T. WAS WILL FIND THAT'S GREAT LET'S JUST PUT WILL SPLIT IT WILL SAY IF IT AFFECTS TAX RATE YOU SAY THIS MEASURE AFFECTS TAX RATES SEE VOTER GUIDE. AND IF IT DOESN'T YOU JUST SAFE YOU SEE VOTER GUIDE FOR INFORMATION HE'S EASILY SOLVED BUT THAT WAS ACCEPTABLE EITHER. AND AND JUST SO FOLKS KNOW I TRY TO WORK WITH -- MISTER WHEN ALL THE ON THIS -- IS MEASURE IT MAY AFFECT TAX RATES SEE VOTER GUIDE FOR INFORMATION AND AND THAT WAS. REJECTED -- SO WE WE TRIED ALSO SPEAK MORE TO THAT AT THE END -- BUT THIS IS THE THE FINAL RESULT THAT WE ENDED UP AT WELL I I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU TO INVESTIGATION AND OTHERS A LOT OF RESPECT BETWEEN YOU TWO AND AS A LOT OF RESPECT FROM THE MEMBERS ON THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE BOTH OF YOU -- YOU KNOW I I CITY WHERE -- LIVE COUNSEL AT THAT MAJORITY REPUBLICAN THREE REPUBLICANS TO DEMOCRATS AND THEY CAME TO ME VERY WORRIED -- THIS LAST YEAR THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE THE VOTES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED. TO PASS A MEASURE TO ALLOW THEM TO BE TO TO BUILD A NEW LIBRARY. ALSO THE AFTER MY SUPPORTERS I SUPPORTED IT AND YOU KNOW DID WHATEVER WE COULD TO TO GET THE INFORMATION OUT THERE BUT ULTIMATELY -- WHILE IT WAS SEEMINGLY PROMISING ON ELECTION NIGHT THE THE MEASURE ENDED UP FAILING -- TO REACH THE THRESHOLD AND NEEDED TO REACH OUT TO GET THE SUPPORT -- TO BUILD THE NEW LIBRARY -- INSEL. I I DO I DO FIND THAT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO A LOCAL ISSUE THAT THESE. THE VERBIAGE AND WHAT IS THERE AND WHAT IS NOT THERE REALLY TENS OF FACT AND IMPACT THE OUTCOME AND WE'RE ALL BUSY WE ALL OF A LOT OF THINGS TO DO -- I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR INFORMATION TO BE THERE BUT INFORMATION IS BE CLEAR NEEDS TO BE CONCISE BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE JUST GOING. TO REALLY KINDA HIT REAL QUICK AND MAKE A DECISION RIGHT THEN AND THERE IS THIS WHAT I WANT IS THIS WHEN I'M WILLING TO TO PAY FOR IT -- AS LONG AS IT'S REASONABLY CLEAR THAT THERE'S GONNA BE SOME TYPE OF AN IMPACT -- WHEN IT COMES TO TAX RATES I THINK IT'S? IT'S IMPORTANT I TO CLEAN THAT UP AS MUCH AS WE POSSIBLY CAN WHILE PROVIDING THE INFORMATION SO THAT PEOPLE. IF THEY ARE INTERESTED CAN UNDERSTAND HEY THIS IS WHAT THIS IS WHAT I'M IN FOR AND THIS IS HOW IT'S GONNA SPECIFICALLY IMPACT ME. YOU KNOW I I KNOW YOU KIND OF QUALIFIED TAX IS A BAD THING. YOU KNOW IF I COULD PAY TWENTY MORE DOLLARS -- YOU KNOW A MONTH TO BUILD A NEW LIBRARY OR CURE CANCER WHATEVER IT IS I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO DO THAT -- AND I DON'T NECESSARILY SEE THAT'S ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S ALL ON US TO PAY FOR THE TYPE OF SOCIETY THAT WE WANT TO LIVE IN. BUT IT SEEMS AT THIS POINT THAT. IT'S REASONABLE BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER GOT A LOT OF A LOT OF PRECIADO -- FOR WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND HOW WE'RE GOING ABOUT IT AND I AND I THINK THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO LOOK AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT EXAMPLES -- BUT IF THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE IN A SOMETHING WOULD LIKE TO SEE. THANK YOU. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND COLLEAGUES. I HAVE A MOTION AS FOR ME THE SECOND. I HAVE A SECOND -- CENTER WOULD YOU LIKE A CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND BECAUSE I PROCEEDED THE THOUGHTFUL CONVERSATION ON ON THIS ISSUE IT -- I DO JUST WANT A TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE THE AUTHOR AND I'VE ALREADY COMMITTED WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE. TO TO TO TALK AND SEE -- IF THERE IS A AWAY BUT I THINK ON A CAT CAN NEVER GUARANTEE RESULTS -- BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE THE CHAIR. PUSH US OUT OF OUR COMFORT ZONE. RIGHT AND THAT MEASURE THE TERRIBLE ATTACHED -- WE WERE INITIALLY VERY RESISTANT TO WHAT THE GENERAL MOTORING. HI CAN ATTEST AND THE CHECK. AND FOR THE CHAIR AND I WE WE WENT BACK AND FORTH AND WHAT I THINK WE CAME TO A GOOD. COMPROMISE AND I APPRECIATE THAT AND BY ONE OF THOSE A REFERENCE MADE TO SPECIAL INTERESTS AND I DON'T AS MUCH AS I LOVE THAT AND I'VE I'VE HAD MY DISAGREEMENTS WITH THOUGHT. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN CALIFORNIA PARTICULARLY AROUND THE ISSUE OF HOUSING. TIME TO TIME -- BUT BUT BUT BUT OUR CITIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS AND COUNTIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICT I WOULD NOT DO THEM A SPECIAL INTERESTS THESE ARE. PUBLIC ENTITIES THAT WE A LOCKED TO EDUCATE OUR KIDS. TO NOT PROVIDE WATER AND SEWER SERVICES TO KEEP THE LIBRARIES OPEN AND KEEP THE FIRE STATIONS OPEN -- AND SO I THINK THEY ARE PART OF OUR PUBLIC FAMILY AND I THINK THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO RAISE REVENUE AND IT'S ALREADY HARD ENOUGH. BOB WE SHOULDN'T BE MAKING IT HARDER -- AND I RESPECT WESTERN AGO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- AND AND THANK YOU TO TO THE FOLKS IN FAVOR THE FOLKS IN SUPPORT. OF THE CONVERSATION ALSO FROM COLLEAGUES WHEN -- I HEARD ABOUT THIS BILL AND I SPOKE WITH BOTH CENTER WIENER AND AND SOME NUMBER ONE ON THE AND ENCOURAGE THEM. TO TRY TO WORK OUT A COMPROMISE AND AND REALLY HOPE THAT THEY WOULD -- AND THEN THEY CAME TO ME A COUPLE OF DAYS SO CLOSE. AND THEY CAME TO ME A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO AND SAID WE JUST CAN'T GET THERE -- AND I KNEW THEN THAT I'D HAVE TO GUIDE GET MORE INVOLVED AND AND END UP COMING TO A RESULT THAT DISAPPOINTED EVERYBODY -- AND I THINK I'VE ACCOMPLISHED THAT. BUT I THINK I THINK IT'S IT'S THE RIGHT PLACE FOR THIS BILL -- YOU KNOW. I HAVE SO MUCH AFFINITY FOR THE EFFORT THAT GOES INTO PASSING PARCEL TAXES AND SCHOOL BONDS WERE THE FIRST THINGS I DID AT THE LOCAL LEVELS VOLUNTEER. AND TWO THOUSAND TEN ON A LOCAL PARCEL TAX OF THE YARD SIGN GUY THAT WAS THAT WAS WHAT I WAS IN CHARGE OF WHEN THEY WENT BACK TO RENEW THAT PARCEL TAX I WAS THEN ON THE CITY COUNCIL -- AND I CAN ENDORSE IT AND MAYBE WAS ON THE BALLOT -- AS A SIGNATORY I CAN'T RECALL AND THEN A COUPLE YEARS LATER WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY THEY CAME TO ME AND ASK FOR MY HELP IN SUPPORTING THE BOND MEASURE -- AND I'VE SEEN THE ENDLESS HOURS FROM VOLUNTEERS IN THE COMMUNITY WHO ARE TRYING TO IMPROVE THEIR COMMUNITY FOR THEIR KIDS FOR THEIR FAMILIES. FOR THE OTHER NEIGHBORS -- AND HOW DIFFICULT THAT IS WITH A LOT OF THESE EFFORTS WITH THE TWO THIRDS THRESHOLD THAT I THINK IS UNNECESSARILY HIGH -- AND THAT I FULLY SUPPORT LOWERING -- AND I FULLY SUPPORT A CA ONE THAT I KNOW HAS BEEN INTRODUCED TO DO THAT -- BUT WHILE THE THE THE THRESHOLD IS. UNNECESSARILY HIGH AND ALLOWS A STRONG MINORITY TO DEFEAT THE WILL OF A VERY STRONG MAJORITY. I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THE LANGUAGE THAT WE HAVE ON THE BALLOT AND AND THE FACT THAT -- PROVIDING VOTERS WITH WITH USEFUL AND TRANSPARENT ACCURATE INFORMATION IN THE VERY LIMITED SPACE THAT IS AVAILABLE IS INCREDIBLY CHALLENGING -- AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT THE INFORMATION. IS INCLUDED IN THE VOTER GUIDE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT TAKES A REMARKABLY COMPLICATED SITUATION. IT SAYS IT'S FULLY FLUSH THAT OUT IN THE VOTER GUIDE -- AND LET'S PROVIDE SOME OF THE HIGH LEVEL INFORMATION IN THE SEVENTY FIVE WORDS ON THE BALLOT THE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURESTHAT WILL APPEAR IN THE VOTER GUIDE UNDER THIS BILL PROVIDE USEFUL AND ACCURATE INFORMATION -- SO I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENT TO ENSURE THAT VOTERS ALSO KNOW THAT THERE IS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE TAX IMPLEMENT IMPLICATIONS. OF TAX AND BOND MEASURES IN THE VOTER GUIDE -- WITH THAT AMENDMENT IN THE TECHNICAL MOMENT OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS I'M RECOMMENDING SUPPORT OF THE BILL. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDD AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS BERMAN AYE BERMAN AYE GALLAGHER. CALDERON CALDERON HELLO. LOW NOT VOTING MAYES.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH I MISTER CHAIRMAN -- AND THANK YOU TO YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL -- AND WE ARE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHICH I JUST WANNA NUMERATOR THERE ARE THE MORE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS CONTAIN THE ANALYSIS AND WE ACCEPT THOSE -- IN ADDITION -- YEAH -- YOU AND I WERE ABLE TO WORK OUT ON A RESTRUCTURING OF THE BILL INCLUDING SOME INTENT LANGUAGE TO THAT WE CAN REFINE -- THE BILL OVER THE COMING MONTHS THEM WILL WORK TOGETHER WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THAT I JUST WANT -- TO WITH THIS YEAR'S MISSIONS AS READ PLACE BECAUSE IT'S RATHER BRIEF YEAH SO THE BILL WILL BE RESTRUCTURED TO READ AS FOLLOWS SECTION. ONE IT IS THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO ENACT LEGISLATION TO PERMIT A PERSON WHO IS NOT A UNITED STATES CITIZEN. TO BE ELECTED IN THE SERVICE A MEMBER OF A COUNTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY COMMA IF PERMITTED BY THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE. SECTION -- TWO READS SECTION SEVENTY TWO TEN IS ADDED TO ELECTIONS CODE TO READ -- NOTWITHSTANDING SECTION SEVEN TWO OH NINE A PERSON WHO IS NOT REGISTERED AS AFFILIATED WITH THIS PARTY IS ELIGIBLE FOR APPOINTMENT TO A COMMITTEE OF SUCH AN APPOINTMENT AS PERMITTED BY THE BY LAWS OF THE COMMITTEE -- AND THAT FIRST SECTION AGAIN IS INTENT LANGUAGE AND WILL BE WORKING TOGETHER TO TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ADDRESSING ALL THE SPECIFIC DETAILS TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE'RE DOING THIS IN EXACTLY THE RIGHT WAY AND I CAN APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE WORKING WITH US AND WE DO ACCEPT THAT AMENDMENT IN ADDITION TO THE MOMENT STATED IN THE ANALYSIS GREAT THANKS. HUN SO -- MY COLLEAGUES I THIS -- THE GOAL OF SB TWO EIGHTY EIGHT IS TO ENSURE THAT ARE DREAMERS AND OTHER IMMIGRANTS IN CALIFORNIA ARE ABLE TO FULLY PARTICIPATE. IN OUR DEMOCRATIC PARTY. ARE WE ARE IN A A PARTY -- THAT HAS EMBRACED OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES HAS ENGAGE OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES -- AT OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES ARE ALREADY DEEPLY INVOLVED I IN THE WORK OF OUR PARTY. BUT THEY CAN NOT SERVED US SERVE IN LEADERSHIP ROLES AND WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR COMMUNITIES NOT JUST TO HAVE OTHER PEOPLE SPEAKING FOR THEM BUT TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES AND TO BE ABLE TO LEAD. A AND I THIS ISSUE WHICH IS OUR WE KNOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS INDICATED -- THAT LATER THIS YEAR IT WILL BE TAKING UP RULE CHANGES IN TERMS OF ALLOWING -- IT NON CITIZENS TO SERVE AS DELEGATES OF THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT IS ALREADY UNDER DISCUSSION AND IN PROCESS -- AND I BELIEVE IT MAY BE TAKEN UP AT THE BOARD MEETING -- IN AUGUST. AND THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY WILL THAT THERE -- FOR POTENTIALLY BE CHANGING ITS OWN RULES. I IN ORDER FOR DOT TO APPLY AT THE COUNTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE LEVEL ON A REVISION TO THE ELECTIONS CODE. IS REQUIRED BECAUSE ELECTION CODE CURRENTLY ON REQUIRED THAT A PERSON BE REGISTERED TO VOTE IN ORDER TO SERVE ON A COUNTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE IN THIS BILL. WILL ALLOW CENTRAL COMMITTEE IF THEY CHOOSE IN THIS OP FORCE THEM TO DO IT BUT IF THEY CHOOSE. TO ALLOW NON CITIZENS -- INCLUDING DREAMERS TO RUN FOR CENTRAL COMMITTEE OR TO BE APPOINTED -- TO SERVICE I THIS ISSUE -- IS ACTUALLY QUITE CURRENT -- IN SAN FRANCISCO WERE EARLIER THIS YEAR -- THE CHAIR OF THE SAN FRANCISCO DEMOCRATIC COUNTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED APPOINTED SERWIS WHO SAW WHO IS SITTING. WITH ME TODAY -- WHO IS A DREAMER -- POINTED HER -- TO FILL A VACANCY -- CREATED BY RESIGNATION ON THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE. SHE IS SERVING AND DOING A GREAT JOB ON OUR CENTRAL COMMITTEE. SHE CANNOT RUN FOR REELECTION. AND AND AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- IMMIGRANTS TWO ALREADY PLAY SUCH A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. ARE ABLE TO ACTUALLY SERVE -- AND LEAD -- I UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS SENSITIVITIES AROUND THESE ISSUES BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE CLEAR. THAT -- WE ALREADY HAVE SITUATIONS WHERE CITIES -- I'M NOT SAN FRANCISCO DOES IT WITH RESPECT TO SCHOOL BOARD -- AND THERE ARE OTHER CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE DONE IT CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY HAVE AUTHORIZED. NON CITIZENS WHO ARE RESIDENTS OF THAT CITY TO VOTE IN LOCAL ELECTIONS. AND THEY CREATE SYSTEMS WHERE -- IN A NON CITIZEN WHO IS A RESIDENT CASH AND BY AFFIDAVIT -- CONFIRM THAT THEY ARE RESIDENT WHERE THEY LIVE AND THEY'RE THERE FOR ELIGIBLE A TO VOTE SO IT'S NOT UNPRECEDENTED. TO ALLOW NON CITIZENS TO PARTICIPATE FORMALLY IN OUR POLITICAL PROCESS AND HERE WE'RE NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. AND THE QUESTION IS SHOULD THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY BE ABLE TO MAKE ITS OWN DECISION. ABOUT WHETHER OR WHETHER WHETHER OR NOT. TO ALLOW. IMMIGRANTS. TO PARTICIPATE AT THIS LEVEL I THINK THEY SHOULD I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE THE PART OF THE FLEXIBILITY WE ARE NOT FORCING THE PARTY TO DO ANYTHING -- SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE -- WITH ME HERE TESTIFIED TODAY ARE AS A MENTION SERVICE TO SO -- WHO IS -- WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO LATINO DEMOCRATIC CLUB ADDED APPOINTED MEMBER CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND THE SAID -- SERRANO OF YOUNG LATINOS A SPIRE.

I SAW THE THE POINT IS HERE YES OF APPOINTMENTS THAT IS STATUTORY AND THEN THEY'LL TEN LANGUAGE TO DO SO THAT WE CONTINUE TO WORK OUT. THERE'S SOME COMPLICATED DETAILS THEN YOU'D BE WORKED OUT OKAY SO BASICALLY THIS DOES IS GO TO THE FLOOR THIS IS JUST INTENT LÏNG WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS THIS WILL GO TO THE FLOOR BUT CENTER IN PLACE. YEAH IT THE MOTION THE MOTION I BELIEVE IS TO THE FLOOR IT'S NOT A AND IS NO FISCAL IMPACT BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE TAKING IT UP UNTIL WE WORK EVERYTHING OUT WITH THE COMMITTEE. SO -- SO IT'LL BE AWHILE BEFORE IT ACTUALLY WOULD BE THE END OF THE COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THAT IS OUR INTENT THEIR INTENTION OUR INTENTION OKAY YEAH BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED AND YOUNG HAS POINTED UP IS A LOT OF AND WE HAD. A CONVERSATION LAST NIGHT IS A LOT OF CONFUSING ELEMENTS OF IT -- I DON'T SEEM LIKE IF WE CAN IF THE DEMS DO THE REPUBLICANS OUGHT TO DO IT LIKE LAST -- BUT IS THAT JUST AN AWFUL LOT OF ISSUESABOUT MEMBERSHIP ON COMMITTEES AND DELEGATES IN VOTING FOR NOMINEES AND PRESIDENTS AND ALL THOSE OTHER KINDS OF THINGS THAT HAPPEN WHEN YOU ON THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE. AND YOUR DELEGATE AND SO -- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT BECAUSE WE JUST WENT THROUGH THIS WHOLE THING WITH THE NETWORK. THE RUSSIANS SHOULD BE INVOLVED IN OUR LOCATIONS YES AND WE'VE HAD CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND SENEGAL FROM OUTSIDE PEOPLE AND IT JUST GETS REAL COMPLICATED AND SO I I I WOULD LIKE SOME CLARITY ON ALL OF THOSE THINGS BECAUSE THEY BEGIN TO SOME OUT OF THE CONFLICT WITH THE VALUES. THE PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVEN'T ONE LEVEL BUT NOT AT THE NOT THE LEVEL SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT THAT WOULD BE IN. FACT WE SHOULD THAT THING OUT WEBER. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE DID I HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. LOOKING FOR A MOTION AND A SECOND I BELIEVE INTENT LANGUAGES WITH EMOTION THE AND THAT'S THE INTENT LANGUAGE PLUS THE THE OTHER THE OTHER BIT YEAH. SO SECOND I'M GONNA MOTION -- AND A SECOND -- THANK YOU TO THE CENTER -- FOR BRING THE BILL FOR IN MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR THEIR COMMENTS IF WE'RE GOING TO AMEND STATE LAW TO ALLOW PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT U. S. CITIZENS TO RUN FOR DEMOCRATIC CENTRAL COMMITTEE -- ON MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL IS WORKABLE FOR ELECTIONS OFFICIALS AND COUNTY CENTRAL COMMITTEES AND DOES NOT CREATE UNACCEPTABLE RISKS FOR CANDIDATES. WHO MIGHT RUN FOR CENTRAL COMMITTEE IF THE LAW IS CHANGED I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE? TO ARRIVE AND THEM AND SO THIS BILL THAT ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS -- AND I ANTICIPATE THAT THE AUTHOR WILL BE ABLE TO WORK WITH RELEVANT STAKEHOLDERS TO COME UP WITH A WORKABLE PROCESS. THAT ALLOWS PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT U. S. CITIZENS TO RUN FOR COUNTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT THE OPPOSITION. YOU SAID WILL PEOPLE SHOULD ASSIMILATE AND VOLUNTEER IT'S A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP AND THESE PEOPLE YOU KNOW THE THE WITNESSES. HAVE BEEN VOLUNTEERING -- AT BUT CURRENTLY THERE IS NO PATH TO CITIZENSHIP AND THAT'S A PROBLEM AND THAT'S A PROBLEM AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL OVER BUT WE DO HAVE CONTROL OVER THIS -- AND AND I THINK THAT FOLKS THAT HAVE GONE INVOLVED AND YOU CAN'T JUST WALK ONTO A CENTRAL COMMITTEE YOU HAVE TO VOLUNTEER FIRST YES ARM PEOPLE'S TRUST YOU HAVE TO YOU KNOW BE IN THE TRENCHES -- AND SO I I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD TIME TO WORK OUT THE DETAILS WHICH IS WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE BILL TODAY -- LOOK FOR TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE SENATOR ON THIS AND WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING I I RECOMMEND SUPPORT THE BILL. MA'AM SECONDARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THE MOST IS TO PASS AS AMENDED BERMAN HI BERMAN I GALLAGHER CALDERON. CALDERON I KNOW. MAYES. MAYES NOT VOTING MULLIN. MULLIN AYE WEBER HI WEBER AVE. THAT IS OUT WITH -- FOR VOTES WILL KEEP THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU CENTER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CALLER. THANK YOU. IN THE MIDDLE. I SEE SENATOR STERN. IN THE AUDIENCE ITEM NUMBER. EIGHT SB [inaudible] SIX THIRTY SIX YEAH. MORNING MORNING SENATOR. WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANKS SIR THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS -- IN THIS DAY AND AGE IT'S HARDER AND HARDER TO CUT THROUGH THE NOISE IN OUR POLITICS. WHEN YOU ARRIVE AT THAT BALLOT BOX? THE HOPE IS YOU'VE DONE ALL YOUR HOMEWORK -- WHAT HOMEWORK IN TALES NOWADAYS ON TWITTER OR FACEBOOK CORD TELEVISION -- IS TRICKY AND PART OF THE INTENT OF THIS MEASURE IS [inaudible] TO BRING USEFUL BUT CONSOLIDATED INFORMATION OF VOTERS TO HELP THEM MAKE DECISIONS -- I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A HEALTHY DEBATE TO BE HAD ABOUT. WHAT IS THATKIND OF SIGNAL YOU NEED AT THE BALLOT BOX TO REALLY MAKE A DECISION ABOUT A BALLOT INITIATIVE COMING YOUR WAY? AND WE THINK THE PREMISE THIS BILL IS WHO'S BEHIND THAT MEASURE SAYS A LOT ABOUT. THE CONTENT AND QUALITY OF THAT BUT YOU HERE TODAY ABOUT SOME ISSUES AROUND MECHANICS AND AND COST STORYLINES IN SORT OF THE BALLOT BEING TOO CONFUSING. AND THAT THINGS BELONGING TO VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE. I DON'T WANT -- TO CASTIGATE. THE VOTER INFORMATION GUIDE IS THAT UNUSUAL RESOURCE BUT IT WAS OVER A HUNDRED PAGES THE LAST ELECTIONS LIKE WE ABOUT TWELVE INITIATIVE. AND THERE THE SUPER DILIGENT VOTERS OUT THERE WHO WHO REVIEW IT -- BUT THERE ARE MANY OF US WHO LOOK FOR SHORT CUTS AND WHO SIMPLY DIDN'T DO ALL THAT HOMEWORK AND SHOP I DON'T ON ELECTION DAY AND WANT TO CAST THEIR VOTE. OR EVEN IT VOTE BY MAIL THEY JUST PICK UP ABOUT THEY WANT TO WORK THROUGH IT SO THE GOAL HERE IS TO ON THAT BALLOT. TO SEE BELOW WHATEVER THE INITIATIVE IS THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE VOTING ON WHO THE TOP THREE SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS ARE. I WE THINK THIS GIVES ROOM -- FOR ALL KINDS OF INTERESTS RIGHT LEFT MIDDLE NOT EVEN ON THE SPECTRUM -- BUT WE THINK THAT THIS IS USEFUL INFORMATION FOR VOTERS AND THAT IT'LL HOPEFULLY EMPOWER PEOPLE THE BALLOT BOX MORE AND LESS SO. TO THE IMPACT OF THE NOISE OUT THERE IN OUR POLITICS THESE DAYS -- HAPPEN ANSWER QUESTIONS IN DIGGING FURTHER I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES ANALYSIS AND I II'M I'M HOPING THE STATE CULTURE HERE FROM OUR ELECTION OFFICIALS BECAUSE I THINK WE WOULD HAVE BEEN A PRETTY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION SO. WITH THAT'LL JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AT THE CENTER YEAH. ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT THAT'S THAT TRENT LYING -- PRESIDENT CALIFORNIA MONEY CAMPAIGN PROUD TO SPONSOR SB SIX THIRTY SIX REALLY THANK. THE AUTHOR FOR HIS WORK AND AND THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS -- COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK. AS WE WORKED ON THE THE CALIFORNIA DISCLOSE ACT OVER THE YEARS WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT -- BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE WANT TO KNOW THE MOST ARE WHO IS BEHIND INITIATIVES. WHO'S WHO'S PAYING FOR INITIATIVES AND PEOPLE ALSO WON'T WANT TO KNOW WHO IS SUPPORTING AND OPPOSING INITIATIVES WITH THE DISCLOSE ACT ON POLITICAL ADS WE CAN'T REQUIRE THEM TO PUT. HERE'S YOUR AT IT NOW YOU HAVE TO LIST YOUR OPPONENTS ABOUT THAT WOULD NOT BE A RECALL REASONABLE THING TO DO FOR POLITICAL ADS. BUT WE CAN PROVIDE THAT WE DO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION AND THE BALLOT PAMPHLET. AND WE COULD PROVIDE IT ON THE BALLOT ITSELF THE BALLOT ITSELF IT IS CURRENTLY THE SEVENTY FIVE WORDS ON THE BALLOT IS A U. USEFUL CONDENSED SUMMARY. OF JUST THE THE THAT THREE OR FOUR PAGE -- OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS AND THEN THE ONE OR TWO PAGE FISCAL IMPACT STATE A STATEMENT BUT IT'S A VERY VERY CONDENSER SUMMARY THAT REALLY DOESN'T GIVE VOTERS JUST KIND OF GIVES. A REMINDER PERHAPS OB BUT THE BALLOT BUT ALSO HAS THE OTHER CRUCIAL INFORMATION OF THOSE ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST AND MOST IMPORTANTLY -- WHO IS SIGNING THEM PEOPLE THAT PEOPLE TRUST ONE WAY OR THE OTHER SO WE THINK THAT IS? REALLY CRUCIAL CRUCIAL INFORMATION FOR VOTERS. I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF CONFUSION IN THE BILL ABOUT. THE AMOUNT OF SPACE THAT IT REQUIRES -- AND I CAN ACTUALLY SEE IN THE LANGUAGE. OF OF THE BILL THAT IT COULD BE CLARIFIED TO TO TO TO MAKE THIS CLEAR. THE THE CLERKS WERE CONCERNED THAT COULD THAT EACH OF THE FUND SUPPORTERS AND OPPONENTS HAD TO BE LISTED ON SEPARATE LINES. THAT IS NOT THE INTENT OF THE BILL. THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS TO GIVE FIFTEEN WORDS DESCRIBING THE SUPPORTERS FIFTEEN WORDS DESPITE DESCRIBING THE OPPONENT SO TOTAL THIRTY TWO WORDS. ON THE SEVENTY TWO WE MARK THAT UP AND THAT MEANS A MODE IN MANY CASES IT'S JUST TO ADDED LINES. AND IN MOST AND AND THE WORST WE EVER SEEN WAS THREE ADDED LINES ON IN LA COUNTY A BALLOT THAT WE ACTUALLY MOCKED UP ON SO -- INITIATIVES AN AVERAGE OF TWO OR THREE LINES IT WOULD BE AT MOST THIRTY ADDITIONAL LINES. IN FACT IN MANY OF THOSE THERE'S EXTRA BLANK SPACE AT THE END SO THERE'S A VERY GOOD CHANCE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO PRINT ANY EXTRA PAPER AT ALL -- IN THIS CASE WHERE THEY MIGHT HAVE TO PRINT ONE EXTRA PAGE WE THINK THIS IS INFORMATION THAT BE. VERY VERY USEFUL TO TO THE PUBLIC THANK AND HAPPY TO WORK ON THAT AND RESPONSE PRESS RUBBER THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

GOOD MORNING EVERYBODY CHAIR BERMAN MEMBERS -- RYAN RUN CO -- PLASTIC ANY COURT REPORTER REGISTER VOTERS AND LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE CO CHAIR -- FOR THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COURSE IN ELECTIONS OFFICIALS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK CENTER STERN HE IS RIGHT WE HAVE BEEN HAVING VERY HEALTHY AND ENGAGE DIALOGUE ON THIS AND WE APPRECIATE ALL HIS HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. I REGRETTABLY WE FIND OURSELVES OPPOSED TO SB SIX THIRTY SIX WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. THE AMOUNT OF SPACE THESE EXTRA WORDS WILL TAKE UP ON THE BALLOT IN JUST A POINT ON THAT -- WE HAVE CAN'T WORDS BASED ON ELECTION CODE SECTION NINE WHICH SAYS THAT PROPER NOUNS ARE CONSIDERED ONE WORD SO. EVERY NAME -- MOST OF A TITLE. EVEN IF IT'S MADE UP OF MULTIPLE WORDS WOULD YOU CONSIDER ONE WORD UNDER THAT SO. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIRTY WORDS ARE THIRTY SHE WORDS MIGHT NOT BE THIRTY TWO WORDS. AT THE ADDED COST APPROVING TRANSLATING ADDITIONAL TEXT. WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRINTING MORE BALLOT CARDS IF THE ADDITIONAL TAX CREATES A NEED FOR MORE BALLOT CARDS. WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT MAILING VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS BOTH MAILING TO THE VOTERS. AND OF COURSE NOW THE POSTAGE PAID RETURN COSTS OF RECEIVING BALLOTS BACK FROM VOTERS IF THE ADDITIONAL TAX CREATES THE NEED FOR MORE ABOUT CARDS. AND WE HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THE BILL MIGHT POLITICIZE THE BALLOT. HOW VOTERS MIGHT BE CONFUSED AS TO WHY THIS DOESN'T EXTEND TO LOCAL MEASURES? AND THE NEED FOR SPECIFICITY ON THE NAY ALLEN HOW THE NAME SHOULD BE PRESENTED ON THE BALLOT IF THIS WERE TO PASS. BUT BECAUSE STATE ELECTIONS ARE NOT REIMBURSABLE ELECTIONS MANDATES HAVE NOT BEEN FUNDED FOR SOMETIME. WE'RE FEARFUL THAT THE CASA SENATOR ASSISTED WITH SIX AT THIRTY SIX WILL BE BORNE BY THE COUNTIES. HOWEVER WE HAVE AS I SAID BEEN IN CONVERSATION WITH CENTER STERN WE THANK HIM FOR ACKNOWLEDGING OUR CONCERNS AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING HOW WE MIGHT MITIGATE OR ELIMINATE ALL OF THESE ISSUES. I THANK YOU IN A PREPARED ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THIS WITNESS. HOW COALING BRITAIN WITH ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA -- I'D PASSED OUT A SHEET WITH OUR OUR CONCERNS OF MAINLY WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD. INCREASE VOTING LINES AND MAKE THE TIMES IN THE POLLS LONGER WHICH WOULD CREATE EVEN MORE LINE LONG LINES BECAUSE OF THE LENGTH OF OF THE BALLOT AND PEOPLE TRYING TO READ ALL THE DETAILS OF THINGS THEY PROBABLY. SHOULD HAVE READ BEFORE THEY CAME IN. BUT IT'LL BE A CREATE MORE CONFUSION OF DURING THE ELECTION. DAY. AND OF IN. TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN R. OBSERVERS UP UP. OBSERVED THAT THE THE ENLARGED TO CARD BALLOT CREATED A LOT OF CONFUSION BETWEEN WITH THE POLL WORKERS AND THE VOTERS. AND WITH OUR CONSOLIDATE ELECTIONS THE BALLOTS GET LONGER EVERY YEAR AND THIS WOULD COMPOUND THAT PROBLEM SO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ABOUT A COLLEAGUES FOR ANY C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> ARE ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SING ON BRING ABOUT A COLLEAGUES FOR ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS MOTIONS SECONDS. QUESTION OR COMMENTS MISTER CALDERON. YEAH THAT THANK YOU SENATOR -- WE HAD A CONVERSATION EARLIER TODAY AND I APPRECIATE THE TIME -- I'M JUST. I'M STRUGGLING TO UNDERSTAND THE NECESSITY FOR THE BILL -- CAN YOU TALK TO ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT. THE PHYSICS FIFTEEN WORDS YES. SO IS THAT. DOES THAT REPRESENT I'M A SUPPORTER AND THIS IS WHY I THINK YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR THE BILL OR IS THAT. HERE WHO ARE WHO WHAT WHAT IS THAT REPRESENT ONE OF THE FIFTEEN WERE DROPPED WHAT AM I GONNA LEARN FROM THIS FIFTEEN WORDS WHO ARE THOSE SUPPORTERS I MEAN SAID THAT TO THE WEIGHT STRUCTURE RIGHT NOW IS IT IT IS THIS. WE WE TALKED -- THERE WE VERIFIES THE SIGNATORIES ON THE BALLOT STATEMENT. SO IT. THE WHOEVER WAS ON A YOU KNOW THE CAMPAIGN NAY DATE SELECT -- THEIR SIGNATORIES ON THAT BALLOT STATEMENT AND THEN THAT WOULD AUTOMATICALLY THEN BE TRANSFERRED BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE SO IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT THE FUNDERS PER SE SO THERE'S A FAIR ARE GOING TO SAY WELL IF IT'S NOT EXACTLY YOU KNOW WHO THE TOP THREE FUNDERS ARTS. IT'S NOT GOING TO BE -- THAT THAT'S NOT CAN BE OBVIOUS BUT HOPEFULLY THROUGH THE OTHER DISCLOSE ACT MEASURE YOU'VE GOT WE SORT OF TAKE CARE THE FUNDING PEACE BUT YEAH IT'S IT'S WHOEVER THAT CAMPAIGN SELECTS TO BE -- THE SIGNATORIES ON ON THE BALLOT STATEMENT SO IF I'M RUNNING PRO PROPOSITION. SEVEN OR WHATEVER. I HAVE A LIST OF PEOPLE THAT SUPPORT THAT PROPOSITION NOW BASICALLY THIS FIFTIES FIFTEEN WORDS REPRESENT. WHO AMONG THOSE GROUPS? RIGHT WE WE WE CHOOSE TO THE SUPPORTERS ARE YES SO. I CAN ACTUALLY MIGHT BE HELPFUL WE HAD A MOCK UP OF WHAT LA IS WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE HE MIGHT IF I AS CHAIR TO MINE DISEASE JUST TAKE. A VACATION THAT'S GREAT -- THIS IS SO. THEY ARE GIVE ME ONE SEC. TO SEE ALL CAN GET YOUR HEADS AROUND IT REJECT -- AND REASONABLE MINDS MAY DIFFER SO. I APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION EARLIER IN. SO YOU'RE LOOKING PICK -- ONE I DON'T KNOW SIXTY ONE OR SIXTY I MEAN GOD. THOSE ARE ALL THE SIGNATORIES. AND SO YOU YOU'D SORT OF WE WE MARK THIS UP BASED ON WHAT WE THINK YOU KNOW. BASED ON WHO THAT THE THE SUPPORTERS WERE EXPRESSLY BY THAT CAMPAIGN AND THIS IS THE SECOND PAGES HOW WOULD LOOK AT THE BILL PASSED. AND THE FIRST PAGES HOW IT LOOKED TO VOTERS. LAST CYCLE CURRENTLY SO CURRENTLY THIS INFORMATION JUST IN THE PHOTOGRAPH. THAT'S IT. ANYONE PUT ON THE BALLOT THAT'S IT [inaudible] OKAY -- YEAH I JUST [inaudible] I'M IN. DO I THINK IT'S COULD BE POTENTIALLY HELPFUL MAY BE I THINK IT'S NECESSARY I DON'T NOW -- IF IT'S IT WOULD NECESSARILY SWAY ANYBODY'S VOTES -- ONE WAY OR THE OTHER I I CAN SIR I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ADDING ANY MORE INFORMATION TO AN ALREADY LIKE THE BALLOT -- AND YOU KNOW I THINK. YOU KNOW IT'S GOOD IN THE SENSE THAT PEOPLE WANT TO GET THAT INFORMATION BUT THAT INFORMATION. SHOULD BE DIRECTLY ON THE BALLOT OR SHOULD THAT INFORMATION. JUST BE IN THE VOTER GUIDE AND GET THE INFORMATION OUT OF VOTER GUIDES BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE WE SHOULD EXPECT THAT INFORMATION. TO BE AND IF IT'S IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR ME. TO KNOW WHO SUPPORTERS IN THE APPEARANCE OPPONENTS ARE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAKE THE TIME TO GET THAT INFORMATION ON THE VOTER GUIDE BECAUSE THAT'S WITH THAT INFORMATION. CURRENTLY ALREADY. EXISTS. SO I JUST. I MEAN I DON'T. I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I SEVERELY GIPSON IT'S NECESSARY TO BE SPECIFICALLY IN THAT. ON THAT BALLOT JUST BECAUSE I MEAN IT'S AYE AYE AYE I BELIEVE IN MORE INFORMATION IS BEING BETTER BUT THEN ALSO LOOK AT WHAT SOCIAL MEDIA IS DONE THE POLITICAL DISCOURSE. IS TOO MUCH INFORMATION AND YOU KNOW WHAT I WHAT I WHAT POINT. AT WHAT POINT YOU KNOW DO WE HAD TOO MUCH IN THERE'S JUST DO WE START CREATING MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONFUSION. AND YOU KNOW WHAT STANDARD I MEAN I'M ARBITRARILY GONNA CHOOSES. THE SUPPORTERS OF A SPECIFIC BALLOT MEASURE HAVE NO NECESSARILY NOT NECESSARILY HAVE A PROCESS BY WHICH OF CHOOSING A SUPPORTERS WERE JUST KIND OF CHERRY PICKING WHAT SUPPORTERS WOULD WANT WHICH MIGHT NOT US. BUT WHICH MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY ALWAYS BE -- INDICATIVE OR TRUTHFUL WHEN IT COMES TO WHO THOSE GROUPS ACTUALLY ARE I MEAN IF I HAVE. YOU KNOW THE ALLIANCE FOR RESPONSIBLE. BUSINESS OWNERS I COULD USE THEM AS A SUPPORTER. BUT THAT COULD BE REPRESENTED BY A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THAT MAYBE AREN'T RESPONSIBLE BUSINESSES. I MEAN ARE THERE ANY DIFFERENTIATION IN THE BILL. THAT WOULD. SAY OKAY IF YOU'RE GONNA PUT THIS GROUP. THIS GROUP OF SUPPORTING THIS MEASURE. WHAT ABOUT WHO READY TO SIGN UP GROUPS YEAH WHO'S REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT GROUP AND IS THERE ANY DIFFERENTIATION AND IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO DETERMINE WHO THAT THAT IT WOULD THEY NOT QUALIFY BECAUSE THAT GROUP IS REPRESENTATIVE OF A BUNCH OF OTHER DIFFERENT? RIGHT OPPONENTS ARE SUPPORTED THE BILL IS NOT DOESN'T TRY TO GET INTO THE NITTY GRITTY OF THAT AND I I GET THAT CONCERN. I MEAN. MY THOUGHT IS -- TIGHT. IN A CONCISE INFORMATION IS MORE USEFUL I I MEAN I'M JUST SITTING HERE READING LIKE PROP SIXTY THREE FIREARMS AMMUNITION SALES INITIATIVE STATUTE REQUIRES BACKGROUND CHECK AND DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AUTHORIZATION. TO PURCHASE AMMUNITION PRIVATE. I LIKE I'M ALREADY. LIKE MY ADD HAS KICKED IN BY LINE. THREE I'LL JUST ADMIT IT RIGHT AND I'M A LEGISLATOR BUT I THEN YOU START READING THROUGH THE FISCAL IMPACT AND YOU HOPE YOU HOPE THAT THAT'S THAT TELLS THE WHOLE STORY. WHETHER THAT NEXT LINE YOU DROP DOWN TO SUPPORTING SAY LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM FEINSTEIN. LAWCENTER TO PROTECT YOU KNOW SO AND THEN COMPARE THAT TO SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION PEACE OFFICERS LIKE. ARE THOSE USEFUL SIGNALS IN THAT CASE I SAY YES BUT YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS PROBABLY A SCENARIO WHERE YOU COULD HAVE A YOU KNOW -- CALIFORNIANS FOR PUPPIES SUPPORT THIS YOU KNOW THE EVIL ALEC RUNNING A RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERS THEY ARE NINE ARE A AND WHATEVER ELSE THERE ARE THE LINE THERE YOU HAVE IT SO -- I THINK YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE ALREADY SOME LEGAL PARAMETERS IN PLACE FOR SIGNATORIES OF A BALLOT SO YOU YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T BE A FALSE ORGANIZATION I MEAN IT IT HAS TO ACTUALLY BE BUT AS WE KNOW -- YOU CAN SET UP FIVE OH ONE C. THREE YOU SEE FOR SO IT'S SOMETHING ACTUALLY I'M OPEN. TO WORKING ON REFINING I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU. YOU SORT OF CUT THAT LINE -- BUT YEAH I'M I'M OPEN TO SOME REFINEMENT THERE I I GUESS MY THOUGHT IS WHOEVER THE PROPONENTS ARE. OR THE OPPONENT'S WRENCH I PUT THEIR BEST FOOT FORWARD. AND YOU THERE'S GOT TO BE A LITTLE BIT OF TRUST AND THAT SORT OF THAT HEALTHY OPPOSITION THAT'S GONNA BEAR ITSELF OUT THAT. YOU KNOW EVEN IF OKAY THE SENIOR ADVOCATES LEAGUE IS IS GOING UP AGAINST THE CALIFORNIA AGAINST WASTE LIKE AND YOU DON'T KNOW ARE YOU MY FOR SENIORS ARE MY AGAINST WASTE MORE. AT LEAST THAT HELPS MORE THAN. REALLY DETAILED LEGALESE SO I'M WE'RE TRYING TO SORT OF FIND WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO CUT THROUGH. EVEN THE WELL CRAFTED NO OFFENSE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE FOLKS WHO SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING THROUGH THESE PUT OUT STATEMENT. BUT THERE'D IT'S IT'S HARD SOMETIMES TO ACTION JUST A MECHANIC SO THIS OUR BEST SHOT AT A SIMPLE PROXY BUT I I TOTALLY RESPECT THE CONCERNED BECAUSE IT'S A DANGEROUS POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT. AND I WORRY ABOUT THAT SOCIAL MEDIA AND THAT SORT OF NOISE INFLUENCE TO I JUST I THINK THAT THIS IS A BETTER WAY TO CUT OUT THE NOISE SO I I ALSO UNDERSTAND YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO SIT IN THAT BALLOT BOX. FOREVER. BUT I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY GONNA MAKE MY DECISION MAKING QUICKER BECAUSE I'M GOING TO SEE THAT. ALRIGHT YOU KNOW GAVIN NEWSOM IN DIANNE FEINSTEIN LIKE. I I TRUST THEM ON FIREARMS LIKE THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME IN OKAY YOU KNOW I HAVE. YOU KNOW LEADERS THE SHERIFFS AND I UNDERSTAND BUT IN THIS CASE SO. WOULD YOU YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR OWN JUDGMENT CALL WHETHER YOU THINK THAT KIND OF PROXY. DISCUSSION IS HEALTHY OR IF IF WE ACTUALLY SHOULD BE ENCOURAGING VOTERS TO GO READ THE VACANT SO THE SENATE ON I APPRECIATE I MEAN I I JUST FUNNY. FOR ME MY APPROACH IS I I I TEND TO BE PRETTY LINEAR WHEN IT COMES MY POLICY IN THEIR CREATIVE WHEN IT COMES MY POLITICS AND YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S JUST WHEN IT COMES TO VALIDATE JUST. I LIKE OKAY HERE'S THE INFORMATION HAS THE CHOICE THAT I NEED TO MAKE AND THEN HERE'S THE OTHER OTHER PIECE IN A BOOKLET. LET THE HAS ALL THE INFORMATION THAT I NEED IN ORDER TO MAKE THE DECISIONS ON HERE SO THAT I'M NOT CREATING ANY CONFUSION ON THIS PIECE. THAT WAY IT'S ALL SEPARATE IT'S NOT IT'S JUST. BECAUSE THERE'S JUST A LOT. EXIST ALREADY THERE GOT NO OBJECTION L. AS JUST THERE'S JUST A LOT SO -- YEAH I MEAN I I CAN APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO A MAYBE THIS IS THE WAY TO DO IT MAYBE IT'S IT'S NOT -- I DO HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THE FRONT GROUPS AND AND WHETHER OR NOT THOSE THEY WOULD QUALIFY AS A AS A LEGITIMATE YEAH. ENTITY TO BE IN SUPPORT ON OPPOSITION OF A SPECIFIC BALLOT MEASURE MEANING. IT'S A MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO CRAFT SOMETHING THERE WHERE THERE'S A THRESHOLD THAT YOU HAVE TO MEET OF A MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION A CERTAIN KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT. COULD QUALIFY. I DON'T LOOK AT THEM NO I APPRECIATE THAT EMILY OFF TODAY -- BUT IF. COMES BACK TO FOR SOME DIFFERENT CHANGES OKAY -- HAPPY HAVE CONVERSATIONS IN A CONVERSATION THEY AFFECT THEM IS GONNA DISMISS -- THEY GIVE US CHAIR -- SENATOR RIGHT. BECAUSE OF MY DEEP RESPECT FOR YOU -- START OFF NEUTRAL ON THIS -- TODAY -- AND BUT I BECAUSE WHAT I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED THIS -- INTEL I SAW THIS -- AND AND AND GROWING IT DIDN'T ALWAYS. THE FEINSTEIN IN A NEW SAID THEN YEAH AND THEN YOU STARTED WITH THE WRONG YOU STARTED TALKING SO I'M ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THIS IS THE LOS. THAT NOTHING GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY OKAY -- I THINK IT WITH OUR STATE MEASURES. IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT -- THAT THE ELECTORATE READ THEM. STUDY THEM AND THEN VOTE ON THEIR CONSCIENCE -- BECAUSE WE ARE INUNDATED WITH INFORMATION. SOME OF US -- AND TO BE FAIR -- SOME OF US IN THIS HOUSE GET VERY LAZY -- IN IN IN THE WAY THAT WE WE VOTE -- AS YOU KNOW -- WE HAVE HERE IN THIS BUILDING -- WITH OUR ANALYSIS SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION. AND OFTEN TIMES -- WE HAVE -- IF HIS WE HAVE HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF BILLS THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT AND WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO TO GO DIG INTO THEM -- AND OFTENTIMES WILL GO THE ALL MY FRIENDS ARE SUPPORTIVE I MUST BE SUPPORT OF MY OPPONENTS -- OUR OUR SUPPORT IF I'M GONNA OPPOSE RIGHT WITH THIS IS WHAT WE WE WE DO NOT EVEN HERE WHEN AND WHERE YOU WE GET PAID TO DO THIS BECAUSE WE WERE IN A DAY WITH TIME. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE STATEWIDE INITIATIVE EVEN LOCAL MEASURES IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR ELECTED TO GO AND DIG AND FIND OUT AS MUCH INFORMATION AS THEY CAN. THE BILL TO MAKE A DECISION AND OFTEN TIMES -- IF YOU GO AND LOOK AND JUST GO WELL MY MY THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE SUPPORTED ARE SUPPORTING US WITHOUT ACTUALLY DIGGING INTO IT. NINE I CAN THINK OF A AND A STATEWIDE INITIATIVE THAT I WAS -- AND AUTHOR OF HERE THEY GOT ON THE BALLOT IN NAM AND THE CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN PARTY OPPOSED IT AND MADE ABSOLUTELY ZERO SENSE TO ME -- AND IF. IF IF THIS HAD GONE STATEWIDE IT WOULD HAVE GONE ON WERE MOST REPUBLICANS WOULD HAVE SUPPORTED BUT SOME IN THE PARTY DECIDED THEY WANTED -- TO TO TO TO GET BACK AT ME AND SO THEY SAID NO WE'RE GOING TO OPPOSE THIS MEASURE WITHOUT THE ELECTORATE WITHOUT REPUBLICANS LOOKING AT SING YOU KNOW THIS IS IMPORTANT. SO I THINK BY LISTING NAMES HERE ACTUALLY WILL SKEW -- WHAT THE ACTUAL INITIATIVE WHAT THE THE LEGISLATION PROPOSED MEASURE IS GOING TO DO? FOR THAT REASON -- AS CHAIR AND I'M TO TO MY OF MY FRIEND -- I'M NOT GONNA BE OPPOSING TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OR MOTIONS OR SECONDS. I'M ON A MAKE A MOTION. WE HAVE A MOTION. ANY SECONDS. SO WHAT WE WILL KEEP THE THAT -- CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE A SECOND WE'LL KEEP IT OPEN -- FOR FOLKS WEREN'T HERE YET -- TO POSSIBLY MAKE THAT SECOND BREAK THANK YOU YEAH IF I CLOSE DOUBLY I APOLOGIZE AND ONE OF THESE CLOTHES NO I ONLY TAKE ONE MORE SHOT T MISTER CHAIR AND LEASE TREADER DO YOU. FOR THE FOR THE RECORD OF TO TO MY GOOD FRIEND FROM [inaudible] HOME DESERT. THE ELECTRIC DID TAKE A LOOK AT THE INITIATIVE IN A QUITE LIKE TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY MAY NOT HAVE BUT ON THE WHOLE PEOPLE ACTUALLY AGREED WITH YOU -- THE BILL IS NOT ABOUT. HOW WE WISH IT WAS IN DEMOCRACY? IT'S HOW IT IS. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING TO VOTE ON AND IT'S A IT'S A THE TOUGH CONCESSION TO MAKE. THAT. WE NEED SHORT CUTS -- BUT TO TRY TO FIND AUTHENTIC MEANINGFUL. WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO GET TIGHT -- TRUST WORTHY INFORMATION IS EVERYTHING SO RELYING ON THE ADVERTISING WORLD OR TELEVISION OR SOCIAL MEDIA TO ME IS DANGEROUS. SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A TRUST WORTHY SAFE AND USEFUL PROXY TO ACTUALLY MAKE DECISIONS. I UNDERSTAND THE THE CONCERNS BUT WE'RE GONNA KEEP CHIPPING AWAY AT THIS SO I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO CONVINCE YOU ALL GOING FORWARD THAT THIS MAKES SENSE AND I I REALLY DON'T WANT TO ADD CONFUSION OF THAT BALLOT. IN REGARDS WHERE THIS LANDS -- I THINK WE CAN ON THAT SECTION NINE ISSUE CAN DEAL WITH IT. ON THE ORGANIZATIONAL THRESHOLD THEY BEGIN DEAL WITH THAT SO I JUST APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION YOUR TIME AND I'LL STOP TALKING -- OR MAYBE RIGHT IF I TALK MORE THE MORE I TALK ME WILL COME ALL THE WAY AROUND I MEAN. THANK YOU YES DR THANK YOU CENTER AND AND I'VE I'VE BEEN CORRECTED BY MY MY CHIEF CONSULTANT -- THAT WAS SO WANTED TO DISPENSE WITH THE MOTION.

A RAINY HICKS OF CALIFORNIA DISABILITY RIGHTS IN SUPPORT THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT SEEING NONE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SAVE YOUR CENTER STERN CALLING BRITAIN ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA. ARE WE OPPOSE THIS BILL -- BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT IT IT -- MARGINALIZES CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE. UNDER THE CURRENT LAW THERE'S A LOGICAL PROCESS OF VOTE COUNTING IN THAT PROCESS. THE INTEGRITY OF THE PROCESS AND ATTEMPTS TO ENSURE THAT ALL VOTES WILL BE COUNTED. AND THE ONES CAST BIOLAGE BY LEGITIMATE VOTERS ALL IN PERSON AND VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS MUST BE PROCESSED. AND COUNTED AND VOTER HISTORIES UPDATED PRIOR TO BEGINNING OF PROCESSING. A PROVISIONAL BALLOTS WITH THE WITH THIS PROJECTED EXTENSION THE PROCESSING OF PROVISIONAL BALLOTS WOULD INEVITABLY OVERLAP THE PROCESSING OF VOTE BY MAIL BALLOTS. EVEN NOW WITH THE CURRENT EIGHT DAY KERR CURING PROCESS THE OVERLAP IS OCCURRING. WHEN ASKED HOW DECISIONS REGARDING THE BALLOT ACCEPTANCE ARE MADE ONE REGISTER SIMPLY REPLIED THAT THEY CAN'T WHICHEVER BALLOT THEY ENCOUNTER FIRST? IN DOING SO ALL CHECKS AND BALANCES ARE GONE TO THE WIND SO WE BELIEVE THAT. FIVE TWENTY THREE JUST EXACERBATES THAT PROBLEM THROWING LEGITIMATE VOTE PROCESSING INTO CHAOS AND WHILE IT'S VITAL TO TAKE ALL REASONABLE STEPS TO ENSURE THAT NO LEGITIMATE VOTER IS DISENFRANCHISED ALL INTENDED IT CONSEQUENCES MUST BE ANTICIPATED WAITED.

FOR EXAMPLE MISMATCHING SIGNATURE TO THE DA TO BE ABLE TO PROSECUTE YEP SO THAT IS STILL IN PLACE IN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE -- FOURTEEN THOUSAND BALLOTS THAT ARE TOSSED. THEIR REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS AND GREENS AND DECLINED TO STATE AND POLITICAL AFFILIATIONS ALL THROUGHOUT. WHY WOULD WE WANT THOSE VOTES NOT TO COUNT? WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AGREE 2000% SEND THEIR AYE -- WE WANTED TO RUN THIS BY MYSELF BUT YOU IT DID.

THEY DO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND OKAY SO VERY BRIEFLY ONE EXCEPT THE TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS -- THIS BASICALLY JUST AUTHORIZES GENERAL LAW CITIES ACCOUNTING SCHOOL DISTRICT TO UTILIZE THE SAME FUNCTIONS THAT CHARTER CITIES ARE CURRENTLY HAVE -- TO ALLOW THEIR VOTERS TO LOOK AT MAJORITY WINNING VOTE METHODS FOR LOCAL ELECTIONS LIKE TOP TWO PRIMARIES IN. A RANK CHOICE VOTING WITH ME AB TEST FIND SUPPORT PAGER ANAND IS FROM FAIR VOTE CALIFORNIA AND DOOR ROSE FROM LEGAL WOMEN VOTERS. THEY'LL BE MORE ARTICULATE THAN MYSELF SO I WOULD JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK. THE YOU CENTER THE BILL HAS A MOTION AND A SECOND PLEASE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I RECOMMENDATION FROM THE CHAIR I MIGHT ADD. GOOD ALMOST AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN. BERMAN AND VERSE -- BUT IN FAVOR AND THAT'S ON THAT SENIOR POLICY DIRECTOR AT SEVERAL CALIFORNIA SEVERAL CALIFORNIA BELIEVES. THAT A HEALTHY LONG LASTING DEMOCRACY RELIES ON EVERY CITIZEN HAVE A RIGHT TO VOTE THE CAN TRULY CONTRIBUTE TO MEANINGFUL REPRESENTATION -- CURRENTLY GENERAL LAW CITIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN ONLY HOLD PLURALITY WINNER ELECTIONS IN WHICH THE CANADA WITH MOST MOST VOTES WINS EVEN IF MAJORITY DID NOT VOTE FOR THAT CANDIDATE -- IN TWENTY SIXTEEN COPPER COMING COST REPORTED THAT BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX AND 200014402% OF WINNING CANDIDATES IN SINGLE SEAT ELECTIONS WERE ELECTED WITH LESS THAN A MAJORITY WENT THREE OR MORE CANDIDATES RAND. ELECTING CANDIDATES WITHOUT MAJORITY SUPPORT CAN UNDERMINE VOTER CONFIDENCE IN ELECTIONS IN GOVERNMENT. SEVERAL BELIEVES THAT CALIFORNIA JURISDICTION TO NOT BE PRECLUDED FROM ADOPTING BUTTON AT THAT THAT'LL OPERABLE REPRESENT MORE REPRESENTATIVE OUTCOMES -- ONLY UNDER CURRENT LAW ONLY CHARTER CITIES AND COUNTIES MAY USE RUN OFF ELECTIONS OF RANK CHOICE VOTING IN THEIR LOCAL ELECTIONS. THIS MEANS ROUGHLY 75% OF CALIFORNIA CITIES DO NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO USE THESE METHODS. CITIES USING TOP TWO RUN OFFS INCLUDE TO THE BEST SAN DIEGO -- SAN FRANCISCO OAKLAND BERKELEY SANTANDER USE RANK TWICE VOTING -- IN RECENTLY IT RANKS WITH READING WITH A ADOPTED STATEWIDE WOULD GIVE GENERAL LAW CITIES COUNTIES AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE ABILITY TO ADOPT TOP TWO AND RANGE WHICH VOTING FOR LOCAL ELECTIONS THIS BILL IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADOPT. AN ELECTION AT THAT SUITS LOCAL NEEDS AND LEAD TO A DEMOCRATS DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT WORKS BETTER FOR EVERYONE. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY AND FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION WE URGE IN A BOAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS LEGAL VOTERS A CALIFORNIA DOOR ROSE IN STRONG SUPPORT I'M GONNA SKIP ALL OF THE BUT POLICY ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE. BUT I DID WANT TO TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF ONE OF OUR BAY AREA LEAGUES THAT WHICH ADVOCATED FOR THE ADOPTION OF RIGHT CHOICE VOTING. BECAUSE I THINK IT HELPS BRING SOME OF THIS TO LIFE THE CITY HAS HAD DISTRICT ELECTIONS FOR MANY YEARS RIGHT. DISTRICT ELECTIONS PRIOR TO ADOPTING WRENCHES VOTING USE A SYSTEM OF PRIMARY RUN A FOR ALL CITY ELECTIONS MAYOR CITY COUNCIL CITY AUDITOR. THE ELECTIONS WERE CONSOLIDATED WITH STATE ELECTIONS TO THE PRIMARY WAS IN EITHER JUNE OR MARCH OF THE CANDIDATE RECEIVED A SIMPLE MAJORITY VOTE IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION. THEY WERE DECLARED THE WINNER AND THERE IS NO RUN OFF IN NOVEMBER. CANDIDATES WORKED REALLY HARD IN THOSE PRIMARY ELECTIONS IN ORDER TO AVOID HAVING TO PAY FOR AND RUN. CAMPAIGNS IN TWO ELECTIONS SO THE RESULT WAS THAT ELECTIONS WERE OFTEN DECIDED BY A SMALL VERY ON REPRESENTATIVE PRIMARY ELECTORATE CANDIDATES WERE ELECTED IN JUNE. BUT DIDN'T TAKE OFFICE UNTIL THE NEXT JANUARY SO HUGE GAP ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS THE CITY CHOSE TO ADOPT RANGE WAS VOTING WAS TO ENSURE THAT CITY IN SCHOOL DISTRICT OFFICIALS. WOULD BE ELECTED AT THE GENERAL ELECTION IF THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE -- PEOPLE ELECTED IN ONE SINGLE ELECTION THEY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ELECTION HAD THE BROADEST REPRESENTATION POSSIBLE THEY ALSO WANTED TO ENSURE THAT ELECTIONS WERE DECIDED BY MAJORITY VOTE. CITIES ELECTIONS FREQUENTLY OF A LARGE NUMBER OF CANDIDATES FOR ANY GIVEN OFFICE EVEN THE EVEN. UNLESS THERE'S AN INCUMBENT RUNNING [inaudible] SO. USING A SYSTEM IN WHICH THE TOP VOTE GETTER WINS IN A SINGLE ELECTION COULD LEAD TO ELECTED OFFICIALS CHOSEN BY RELATIVELY FEW SMALL NUMBER OF VOTERS. RANKED CHOICE VOTING WAS A SOLUTION TO BOTH THOSE CONCERNS RIGHT HAVING ELECTIONS DECIDED OF THE GENERAL ELECTION AND ALSO ENSURING THAT THOSE ELECTED. SICK WERE SELECTED BY MAJORITY VOTE. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS IS THAT PEOPLE HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY DON'T FEEL THE NEED TO VOTE FOR DEFAULT CANDIDATE WHO CAN WIN THAT THEY DON'T REALLY WANT OF A FOUR BUT THEY CAN WIN. NOT AS THEIR FIRST CHOICE BUT ANYWAY THEY CAN BOTH THEIR HEART AS THEIR FIRST CHOICE VOTE. AND THEN THEY CAN BE MORE PRAGMATIC WITH SECOND AND THIRD CHOICES FINALLY. THE LEAGUE FOUND THAT THERE'S LESS NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING IT HASN'T DISAPPEARED BUT IT'S REALLY HARD FOR CANDIDATES TO DISPARAGE OTHERS RUNNING FOR THE SAME OFFICE WHEN YOU'RE ASKING FOR SECOND AND THIRD CHOICE VOTES PLEASE. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

FORTY SEVEN I LIKE HOW -- SENATOR I'LL BECOME SENATOR STERN BECOMES. SEVEN ONE SAID THAT IT'S A NEW TRANSITION ON THIS BILL -- BUT YEAH MEMBERS LISTEN WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO TRANSPARENCY WE LOVE TRANSPARENCY BUT WERE OPPOSED TO THIS BILL FOR TWO REASONS NUMBER ONE WE DO BELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO PLACE EXPENSIVE BURDENS. ON PETITIONER GATHERS EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE ONLY UPDATED UPDATING THE LISTING OF THE TOP FUNDERS EVERY MONTH -- THERE'S STILL THE THREAT OF CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR FAILING TO COMPLY WHICH WILL BE EXPENSIVE AND YOU STILL NEED TO UPDATE AND REPRINT THE PETITIONS EVERY MONTH WHICH WILL ALSO BE EXPENSIVE. FURTHER WE THINK THE BILL IS A LITTLE BIT REDUNDANT -- THE FUNDING OYSTERS ALREADY AVAILABLE ON THE FCC'S WEBSITE -- AND ALSO THE SECRETARY OF STATE'S WEBSITE AND GOVERNOR BROWN TO VETO A SIMILAR BILL BACK IN TWENTY FOURTEEN A. B. FOUR HUNDRED BY THEN ASSEMBLYMAN FONG -- AGAIN MAINLY ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE BILL WAS REDUNDANT SO MAYBE THE CHAIR OR SUBSTITUTE AUTHOR CAN SPEAK TO THAT AND ASK FOR NOVA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE BRING BACK TO BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COLLEAGUES SEEING NONE -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT GREAT -- THIS BILL WILL HELP WILL HELP VOTERS MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT REQUIRING THAT VOTERS BE PROVIDED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE TOP FUNDERS A BALLOT MEASURE CAMPAIGNS OF THE TIME THAT THEY ARE ASKED TO SIGN THE PETITION.
