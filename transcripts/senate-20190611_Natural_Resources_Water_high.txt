COMMERCIAL OR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES AND PROHIBIT THE SALE OF RAW FOR IN CALIFORNIA. FOR TRAPPING CALIFORNIA'S DONE AN EXTREMELY SMALL SCALE TODAY IN HIS BROUGHT IN VERY LITTLE INCOME INTO THE STATE WHICH WAS ONLY ABOUT FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS LAST YEAR. HOWEVER CONTINUES BE INHERENTLY CRUEL AND INHUMANE PRACTICE FOR THE ANIMALS TRAPPED IN CAN HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES SUCH AS KILLING PETS AND PROTECTED WILDLIFE. DESPITE REQUIREMENTS IN STATE LAW FOR THE TRAPPING PROGRAM TO COVERED SOME COST TRAPPING LICENSE FEES NOT COVER THE ACTUAL COST OF IMPLEMENTING STATE -- TRAPPING PROGRAM. AB TWO SEVENTY THREE WOULD END THE USE OF TAXPAYER FUNDS TO SUBSIDIZE FOR TRAPPING AND PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S NATIVE WILDLIFE FROM CRUEL AN OUTDATED PRACTICES. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THIS BILL WILL NOT AFFECT THE TRAPPING FOR PEST CONTROL DEPREDATION OR PROPERTY PROTECTION IT WOULD MAINTAIN THE ABILITY TO TRAP IN ORDER TO MANAGE WILDLIFE. WHICH MAY BE ENTERING CROPS OR PROPERTY WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NINE ABOUT VERY GOOD THANK YOU -- WE HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT MORNING. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS NICHOLAS PSYCHIC DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS FOR SOCIAL COMPASSION LEGISLATION AND PROD CO SPONSOR BABY. TWO SEVEN THREE I'LL KEEP IT SHORT. NOT REITERATE SOME OF THE POINTS. THAT THE AUTHOR MADE BUT I WILL SAY THAT -- TRAPPING IS HORRENDOUSLY CRUEL AS CONSUMERS ARE LEARNING VIA SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHER OUTLETS. SHOWING TERRIFIED ANIMALS CROUCHING IN FEAR TRYING DESPERATELY TO ESCAPE THE IMMINENT THE NOT ONLY DO TARGET MAMMALS FEEL THIS PAIN BUT SO DO MANY OTHER NON TARGET ANIMALS. TRAPS DO NOT DISCRIMINATE SO IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR TRAPPERS TO FIND HOUSEHOLD PETS BIRDS. ENDANGERED IN RED LISTED SPECIES ANOTHER ANIMALS DYING OR DEAD IN THEIR TRAPS. WITH THAT I'LL PASS THE MIKE TO OUR OTHER WITNESS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MORNING MORNING I'M JENNY KEATING WITH THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION WITH MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS IN CALIFORNIA. A FIVE YEARS AGO A SINGLE TRAPPER OPERATING ALONG THE BOUNDARY OF JOSHUA TREE NATIONAL PARK KILLED ENOUGH BOBCATS IN ONE SEASON TO SEVERELY DEPLETE THE LOCAL POPULATION OF THE SPECIES. TURNING ANIMAL FREQUENTLY OBSERVED IN APPRECIATED BY TOURISTS AND LOCALS ALIKE INTO A SPECIES NOW FIVE YEARS LATER THAT IS STILL RARELY SEEN. IN RESPONSE CALIFORNIA WISELY BAND BOBCAT TRAPPING IN THE STATE THE PROBLEM ISN'T LIMITED BOBCATS AS APPROXIMATELY A DOZEN NATIVE SPECIES ARE STILL TARGETED FOR THEIR FOR LAST YEAR A SINGLE TRAPPER OPERATING IN AND AROUND THE RECENTLY DESIGNATED SAN GABRIEL MOUNTAINS NATIONAL MONUMENT COURT KILLED MORE THAN A HUNDRED GRAY. FOXES IT'S SAN GABRIEL MONUMENT WAS DECLARED BY PRESIDENT OBAMA IN SIGNIFICANT PART TO PROTECT WILDLIFE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWS A SINGLE FUR TRAPPER TO SYSTEMATICALLY DEPLETE THE WILDLIFE IN THIS AREA TO THE DEPTH DETRIMENT OF NATURAL ECOSYSTEMS AND THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO VISIT THE MONUMENT ANNUALLY. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY'RE MORE FOXES IN. OTHER REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA AND REGULATED TRAPPING THAT OCCURS UNDER CURRENT LAW CAN HAVE REAL IMPACTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AFFECTING WILDLIFE CONSERVATION EFFORTS AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN RECREATION. IN THE AREA. BY PROHIBITING COMMERCIAL FOR TRAPPING IN CALIFORNIA AB TWO SEVENTY THREE WILL PROTECT NOT JUST THE WILDLIFE AND ECOLOGY OF THE STATE BUT ALSO THE TOURISM DEPENDENT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE TIED TO HEALTHY WILDLIFE POPULATIONS. OUTDOOR INDUSTRY FOUNDATION ESTIMATES THAT MORE THAN FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS ENGAGING WILDLIFE VIEWING IN SOME MANNER CONTRIBUTING OVER THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS THE STATE'S ECONOMY. IN SOME WAY THE LOOK AT ECOLOGICALLY ECONOMICALLY OR ETHICALLY ENDING FOR TRAPPING IN CALIFORNIA IS LONG OVERDUE I RESPECTFULLY URGE A YES VOTE ON THIS BILL.

HI AND THEN AT WHEELER AND I AM THE PRESIDENT FOUNDER OF CONNECTION EARTH AND WE WORK GLOBALLY TO SAVE. ENDANGERED WILDLIFE AND WE ARE IN FULL SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND WE REPRESENT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND CONSTITUENTS. HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU. I THEIR HARRISON ROBERT OF FROM -- OAKLAND AND I SUPPORT -- THERE BEAR DELAWARE FROM NEWPORT BEACH NAY SUPPORT. DICK WOULD SACRAMENTO IN SUPPORT YOU. HELEN DILLINGER HUMANITARIAN IN SUPPORT [inaudible] BUT ORGANIZATION. ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT. IN NINETEEN DO YOU HAVE ANY IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] MORNING. MY MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS NOEL CREAMERS. FROM YOUR FEDERATION WELL A PRE SHEET THAT THE BILL CONTINUES TO ALLOW FOR TRAPPING TO TO PROTECT LIVESTOCK AND DEAL WITH PROPERTY DAMAGE AND LOSS. WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE BAN. ON RECREATIONAL TRAPPING. AND HERE'S WHY. OUR MEMBERS DO ALLOW TRAPPERS ACCESS TO THEIR LANDS. TWO RECREATIONALLY TRAP THE REASON HEY DO THIS IS BECAUSE THAT THEN REDUCES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT AND LOSS IN THE FUTURE SO THAT THEY DON'T NEED. TO CAN USE TRAPPERS HOPEFULLY OR THEY REDUCE THE NEED TO HAVE THOSE TRAPPERS AFTER A LOSS OCCURS SO THEY CAN GET THAT CAN ALLOW TRAPPERS TO COME OUT AND PREVENTATIVE WE WORK. SO THEY DON'T NEED IT LATER. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT. THERE'S A BIT OF A DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE POTENTIAL COSTS THAT THIS BILL. THAT THE TRAPPING PROGRAM CREATES FOR THE STATE TO THERE WAS AN ANALYSIS A COUPLE YEARS AGO BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. THAT ESTIMATES THAT THE TOTAL COST OF OPERATING THE TRAPPING PROGRAM IS A LITTLE OVER SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. WHICH MEANS TO COVER THAT COST. WITH THE LOW LEVEL OF TRAPPING THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. LICENSE COSTS NEED TO BE A HUNDRED AND SEVEN DOLLARS. CURRENTLY THERE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS SO THE FEES ARE COVERING THE COST OF OPERATING THAT PROGRAM. I THINK WHERE THE DISAGREEMENT OCCURS IS THE PROPONENTS OF THE BILL BELIEVE THAT. THOSE COSTS SHOULD ALSO COVER THE COST OF ENFORCEMENT. HOWEVER. IF TRAPPING IS BEYOND. THAT DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE NEED TO HAVE WARDENS OUT. TO ENFORCE AND MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE AREN'T TRAPPING. SO THAT ENFORCEMENT COST REMAINS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE A TRAPPING PROGRAM. I'VE HEARD WARDEN SAY HAVING LICENSE TRAPPERS OUT THERE IS HELPFUL. BECAUSE IT CAN BE EYES AND EARS TO THE WARDENS. TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE AREN'T ACTING ILLEGALLY THEY CAN I'M PROVIDE TIPS TO THE WARDEN'S SO YOU ACTUALLY LOSE THAT WHEN YOU BANNED TRAPPING. THE MINUTES FOR THOSE REASONS THAT WE OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I MISTER CHAIRMAN RESERVE THE COMMITTEE MARKEDLY WITH CALIFORNIA WATERFOWL ASSOCIATION. ARE -- MEMBERS AND OUR ORGANIZATION MANAGE LANDS UP AND DOWN THE STATE WETLAND PROPERTIES. AND WE CURRENTLY RECEIVE TRAPPING SERVICES FOR FOR FOR FREE FROM RECREATIONAL TRAPPERS -- TO CONTROL THINGS LIKE SKUNKS RACCOONS POSSUMS WHICH PREY ON WATER FOUND S. -- THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE WATER FELL MANAGERS TO NOW BASICALLY PAY FOR THOSE SERVICES. AND USE PASS CONTROL OPERATORS WHO AREN'T NECESSARILY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROPERTIES AND YOU KNOW THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY FACE OUT THERE. WELL WHEN BUDGETS AS YOU ALL KNOW ARE VERY LIMITED -- AND ADDING THESE COSTS ON THERE IS DEFINITELY GONNA FACT OTHER WETLAND MAINTENANCE AND OTHER ACTIVITIES CONSERVATION ACTIVITIES SO. CAN BE LESS MONEY AND AND RESOURCES FOR THOSE SERVICES. ONE THING THAT REALLY IS -- TROUBLING FOR US IS IS THE PRESIDENT ALSO THAT THIS BILL SETS I'M YOU'RE BASICALLY BANNING A METHOD OF TAKE FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES. AND I'D REMIND THE COMMITTEE THAT HUNTING AND FISHING TO ARE DOWN AT TIMES FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSES SO WE MAY HAVE PEOPLE COME BACK AND ASK. WHY AREN'T THOSE -- ACTIVITIES AFFECTED AS WELL. IS YOU KNOW TO TRAPPING IS ALREADY HIGHLY REGULATED BY THE CALIFORNIAFISH AND GAME COMMISSION. AND WE FEEL ARE HONESTLY THAT THAT'S THE APPROPRIATE VENUE FOR THIS DISCUSSION IF. THERE NEEDS TO BE AN ANALYSIS OF ANY NEW RESTRICTIONS ON TRAPPING THAT'S WERE THAT DISCUSSION SHOULD TAKE PLACE FIRST. SO WE WOULD -- JACK YOUR OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE COME FORWARD. YOUR CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BILL GAMES TO A REP. KAMALA NOT FOUNDATION THE CALIFORNIA DEAR ASSOCIATION THE WILD SHEEP FOUNDATION. THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FOR CONFIRMATION AND THE CALIFORNIA BERMAN UNDERSTATE ARCHERY SOCIAIS XIN IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL [inaudible] ANY OTHERS [inaudible] ONE NOT. AS A HEAD FAKE. OKAY VERY GOOD WILL BRING IT BACK -- QUESTIONS. I WISH TO OPERATE IS SUBCOMMITTEE SO. NEW QUORUM YET. WELL I WANT. TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'M JUST. THIS TERM RECREATIONAL TRAPPING -- NEW HELP SHED LIGHT ON WHAT. MOTIVATES RECREATIONAL TRAPPING INTERNAL OPPONENTS WOULD ONE ADDRESS THAT AS WELL BUT THERE BE A COMMERCIAL. MOTIVE FOR WHAT'S CALLED RECREATIONAL TRAPPING. ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK IF -- FOLKS ARE INVITING PEOPLE ONTO LAND FOR RECREATIONAL TRAPPING -- AND THEN THERE ARESUBSEQUENTLY SELLING THAT FOR THAT THERE PROBABLY STE. ACTUALLY. OPERATE OUTSIDE OF THE LAW NOW ANYWAY THE IDEA I SUPPOSE I I CAN'T SHED LIGHT ON WHY SOMEBODY WOULD RECREATIONALLY. TRAP AN ANIMAL -- OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A VALUE PROPOSITION THAT DOESN'T -- MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME -- BUT I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED BY THAT THAT'S A LITTLE. CHANGE OF OF COURSE THAT THE OPPOSITION IS USING -- HOWEVER IF SOMEBODY REALLY LIKES TO TRAP ANIMALS AND YOU HAVE A PEST PROBLEM ON YOUR PROPERTY -- I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING AND CURRENT LAW THAT WULD REQUIRE YOU YOURSELF TO SET THE TRAP YOU COULD HAVE A FRIEND COME OUT AND SET THE TRAP. TO DEFEND YOUR PROPERTY AND WILDLIFE AGAINST -- JURORS ARE INVASIVE SPECIES AND SO AS I I THINK THERE WOULD BE AN AVENUE. FOR SOMEBODY WHO GETS A THRILL OUT OF TRAPPING SMALL ANIMALS. AND I DO NOTICE THAT. TRAPPING FOR DEPREDATION PURPOSES TO A RADIC HE PASSED. IS STILL PROTECTED. UNDER YOUR BILL ABSOLUTELY WE KNOW WE HAVE A NEW CHAIR PROBLEM IN THE STATE AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT STOPS PEOPLE FROM TRAPPING -- NEW CHAIR OTHER INVASIVE SPECIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER. VERY GOOD. CAN I AM. I RECOGNIZE SOME OF THE CONCERNS MAYBE FROM OUR WEST LINN RESTORATION FOLKS BUT THERE MAY BE NEW BUSINESSES NOW THAT EMERGED. AMONG OUR YOU KNOW WETLANDS COMMUNITY TO SAY. HOW CAN WE MAYBE? YOU KNOW QUE IN THE CONSIDERATION. ALBUMS YOUR NUTRIA PROBLEMS AND A I KNOW A LOT OF THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN AND APPROPRIATIONS DISCUSSION WHICH ISN'T REALLY THE PURVIEW OF THIS COMMITTEE BUT FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME WE OF ALL. STATE LAW HERE AND THERE IS ROOM. PEOPLE ARE STILL GONNA RECREATIONALLY HUNT IN THIS STATE BUT THIS FORM OF PRACTICES -- BARBARIC IN MANY CASES AND IT'S IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE LOOK AT THE DEFINITION OF USING A STEEL JAWED LEG HOLD TRAP. OR SOUGHT TO STORE SPIKE JAWS TO DO SOME OF HIS WORK AND YEAH. HAD YOU BROUGHT FORWARD -- THE IMPACT ON THE FUNDS SEEMS MINIMAL FROM THE ANALYSIS SO. DID YOU GUYS HAVE ANY OTHER FURTHER RESPONSES BEFORE MOVED ON WE WERE HAPPY TO LEAVE THE BILL ON HOLDEN AND VOTE WHEN WE HAVE. ALL COMMITTEE HERE BUT ANY FURTHER RESPONSES FROM. I'M WELL I JUST LIKE TO CLARIFY BUT AT THAT AS FAR AS THE RECREATIONAL AND COMMERCIAL TRAPPING FOR LICENSING PURPOSES THOSE ARE ESSENTIAL. THANKS AND THERE WERE ONLY THERE ARE A TOTAL OF SIXTY EIGHT SUCCESSFUL. COMMERCIAL SLASH RECREATIONAL TRAPPERS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN IT IS A VERY LOW NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND THE IDEA THAT THIS IS -- THAT THOSE FOLKS ARE CONTRIBUTING IN ANY WAY SIGNIFICANTLY TO PASS CONTROL ON AGRICULTURAL LANDS IS. A BIT -- A BIT HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND AS THE ASSEMBLY WOMAN MENTIONED -- PRODUCERS ARE ALLOWING COMMERCIAL FOR TRAPPERS WHO DON'T HAVE A PEST CONTROL LICENSE ONTO THEIR LAND SPECIFICALLY TO TRAP ANIMALS THAT ARE CAUSING DAMAGE TO CROPS. THERE SUB THE AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY SELLING OUT FOR THEY ARE. SUBVERTING THE POLICY PURPOSES OF EXISTING LAW AND POTENTIALLY VIOLATING IT. SO -- AND AS FAR AS I CAN SEE HERE THE LICENSE SALES FOR TRAPPERS GENERATED ABOUT. FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS SO. IT SEEMS LIKE A GAP WE CAN MEET -- ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE IF YOU'RE OAK SORRY AND COVER YOUR WILL. ANDRES FOR GETTING HERE LIMIT LATE BUT I I AM THANK YOU FOR THE EXPLANATION IN TERMS OF AG -- ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT -- THE ABILITY. TO PROTECT FOOD SAFETY AND ANIMAL PRETTY AND PREDATION ON ON THE FARM OBVIOUSLY IS A IS A CHALLENGE BUT I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING HERE IN REGARDS TO NATIVE AMERICAN TRADITIONS AND STUFF IS IT. IT HAS THAT COME UP AS AN ISSUE AT ALL. ACTUALLY WHEN I FIRST INTRODUCED A THAT WAS ONE OF THE THE QUESTIONS I HAD AND NEED AMERICANS DO NOT NEED A A LICENSE TO TRAP FOR CULTURAL PURPOSES. RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WE FOR ANYONE TWENTY ONE MORE. ALL RIGHT ALLOW YOU TO CLOSE AN WILL LEAVE THE BILL ON THANK YOU -- I THINK YOU KNOW AND AND I'VE OBVIOUSLY I'VE THOUGHT A LOT ABOUT IN AND ALTHOUGH I MAY HAVE PERSONAL THING FEELINGS ABOUT RECREATIONAL HUNTING THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS -- I IT MAY HAVE PERSONAL FEELINGS ABOUT RECREATIONAL. KILLING THEM AND BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS IT'S SPECIFIC TO TRAPPING AND WE KNOW THAT -- TRAPPING IS CRUEL AND AND CAN HAVE -- UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR ANIMALS THAT WEREN'T MEANT TO BE TROUT ESPECIALLY WHEN BEING DONE FOR FOR COMMERCIAL RECREATIONAL PURPOSES -- WITH NO BENEFIT REALLY YOU KNOW IT'S NOT AS IF IF -- THESE LICENSES ARE IN ORDER TO ADD TO STOP THE NUTRIA WE'RE ALL FOR THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ABOUT -- IT'S OF A SITUATION I THINK WE HAVE EVOLVED TO AND I HOPE THAT AS A VALUE STATEMENT THAT WE CAN STOP IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A COMMITTEE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SUMMER. ALL RIGHT WE'LL LEAVE THAT -- WE HAVE A QUORUM AND I'M DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER. OKAY SO ASSEMBLY MURMURED SU CHI WELL IN LINE HERE. FILE ITEM NUMBER.

THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S PLANS TO FRACKING DRILL AND SOME OF OUR MOST BEAUTIFUL FEDERAL PROTECTED LANDS AND NATIONAL MONUMENTS [inaudible] THIS BILL. IS A CONTINUATION OF THE GREAT IDEA TO THE CENTER JACKSON. A PROPOSED -- IN THE LAST -- SESSION THAT I SUPPORTED ON THE ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE. BOB THIS TIME -- NOT TO FIGHT THE OUR TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S PLANS TO EXPAND OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING.

TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR TO REVIEW TWENTY SEVEN NATIONAL MONUMENTS INCLUDING SEVEN MONUMENTS LOCATED WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S BORDERS. A FEDERAL PROTECTED LANDS LIKE BEARS YEARS -- IN UTAH HAVE ALREADY BEEN OPEN UP TO OIL DEVELOPMENT. AND THIS YEAR OR LAST YEAR HERE IN CALIFORNIA. THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT HAS AUTHORIZED THE DRILLING OF NEW WELL AND IS THE INSTALLATION OF NEW PIPELINE INSIDE THE WILD FIRE OF FLOUR RICH CARISSA PLANE NATIONAL MONUMENT. NEAR SAN LUIS OBISPO. AND OF COURSE EARLIER THIS MONTH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OPEN UP MORE THAN A MILLION ACRES OF FEDERAL PROTECTED LANDS WITHIN OUR STATE BORDERS TO POTENTIAL FRACKING AND DRILLING.

MEMBERS QUESTIONS SENATE JACKSON CENTER YES I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL I THINK THE APPROACH THAT WE HAVE BEEN TAKING IS BEEN. AN APPROPRIATE ONE I CANNOT IMAGINE WHY WE WOULD WANT TO START DRILLING IN OUR MOST PRISTINE AREAS. SO I WILL BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL AND I NOTE THAT I'M NOT INCLUDED AS A CO AUTHOR SO IF THERE IS AN AMENDMENT TO BE TAKEN PLEASE ADD ME AS A CO AUTHOR OF TO THEM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- YEAH I I GUESS MY QUESTION IS. AS I WAS READING THIS IS I I THOUGHT THAT WE HAD ALREADY DEALT WITH THIS WHOLE ISSUE BEFORE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY WE NEED ANOTHER VALVE. I THOUGHT THAT THE THE WHOLE ISSUE OF OF NOT ALLOWING US ACCESS TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAS WAS ESTABLISHED. FOR THE OF THE THANK YOU SENATOR THAT WAS THE BILL THAT CENTER JACKSON. HI AND I HAD WORKED ON LAST YEAR TO DEAL WITH THE THE STATE WATERS THE DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF OFFSHORE OIL DRILLING IN FEDERAL WATERS BUT THIS BILL IS SEEKING TO EXTEND THAT BASIC CONCEPT. TO FIGHT OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S PLANS NOW IN THE FEDERAL PROTECTIVE -- LANDS ON LAND RATHER THAN OFF SHORE. THE LASHES BILL WAS FOR OFF SHORE. THIS YEAR'S BILLS FOR LAND THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU SOME MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS FOR I JUST WANTED I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU ABOUT [inaudible] SCOPE HERE. I'M GLAD WE'RE GOING INLAND AND NOT JUST STAYING OFF SHORE. ENTER COUNTIES AT RISK AND BARBARA COUNTIES AT RISK LA COUNTY IS A RISK LOT OF THIS RIGHT NOW OUR BACKYARDS OR INCREDIBLY SENSE VERY SO. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP NOT JUST ON THIS ISSUE BUT IN GENERAL FUND ADDING THE HARD FIGHTS HERE TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR NATURAL LANDS -- TWO QUESTIONS THOUGH. WHY NOT ALL FEDERAL LANDS THE WIDEST FEDERALLY PROTECTED AND THE OTHER IS ABOUT? MAINTENANCE OF INFRASTRUCTURE IF THEY COULD POTENTIALLY SLIP IN TO SOMEBODY'S PROTECTED LANDS UNDER THE UNDER THE AUSPICES OF MAINTENANCE AND GET AROUND. YOUR INTENT HERE SAID YOU MIND COMMENTING ON THOSE ISSUES THEIR LANE SO -- I I KNOW THAT -- THE CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY AMONG OTHERS HAVE EXPRESSED -- IN INTERESTED IN EXPANDING INTO A NOT JUST FROM HER FEATHER PROTECTED LANDS BUT TO ALL OF FEDERAL LANDS. ON IT -- TO WAS OUR ASSESSMENT THAT. TO THAT THE THE MOST -- URGENT -- THREAD HERE IS WITH OUR PROTECTED LANDS OUR NATIONAL MONUMENTS. WE WANT TO START THEIR ARM. WELL WE DO WE DO -- WE DID WE DID NOTE THAT THERE WAS -- A SIGNIFICANT -- EXISTING -- OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT ON ON FEDERAL LANDS ON AND SAID THAT WOULD -- TO PROBABLY RAISES SIGNIFICANTLY -- INCREASED LEVEL OF OPPOSITION -- TO OUR EFFORT -- IF WE EXPANDED TO ALL FEDERAL LANDS ALSO AT THIS POINT -- WE WE ARE. THAT WE ARE PRIORITIZE A TRYING TO PROTECT OUR FEATHER PROTECTED LANDS. IN MY CONCERN IS THAT. WE OVER PROMISE AND THEN. EIGHT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MOVES INTO. OUR BACKYARD. AND CONTINUES TO DRILL IN THE PUBLIC SAYS WELL I THOUGHT YOU. PUT YOU KNOW I'M [inaudible] IN. PROTECTIONS IN PLACE AND THEN. WE END UP IN A SITUATION WHERE. THOUSANDS OF ACRES -- OPENED UP THAT -- THEY ARE INCREDIBLY VULNERABLE -- THERE MAY BE OPPOSITION. I I RECOGNIZE THIS THE BILL BEFORE US TODAY BUT YEAH I I WOULD CERTAINLY BE IN SUPPORT OF AN EXPANSION HERE AND MAY BE FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AS YOU GO FORWARD BUT LOOKING AT THIS MAINTENANCE PROVISION. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENS. IS THAT THEY'LL PHRACK FIELDS. YES TO MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO CLEAN OUT THE PIPES. REPAIR TO MAINTAIN SAFETY. BUT IN SO DOING THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF EXTRACTION THAT OCCURS AT THE SAME TIME [inaudible] SO -- I DON'T KNOW HOW WE TAKE IN THAT PIECE OF IT UP -- BUT I GUESS I I WOULD JUST BE CURIOUS WHAT WHAT LANDS THANK. YOU GUYS HAVE A MAP OF WHAT THIS WOULD ACTUALLY ENTAIL LIKE WHAT WHAT WOULD BE ME MISSING HERE IN TERMS OF FEDERAL LANDS IN THE STATE BY NOT INCLUDING THOSE. ISLAM IS IT IS IT PRETTY LIKELY THAT A LOT OF VENTURA COUNTY IN LA. COUNTY IN SANTA BARBARA. BUT THEY'RE NOT IN A NATIONAL MONUMENT AREA THOSE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE STILL. I WOULD TO HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT DAY ALL RIGHT. YEAH THERE MIGHT. THANK YOU MAY BE ALONG THE LINES THAT THE CHAIRS ASKING I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS. FOR THE ANNOUNCES SHE MAKES REFERENCE TO CREE SO PLANES NATIONAL MONUMENT WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY. IN A REFERENCE IS THERE THAT IN. TWENTY EIGHTEEN YOUR OF LAND MANAGEMENT APPROVED THE DRILLING OF A NEW WELL IN THE INSTALLATION OF A NEW PIPELINE INSIDE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE MONUMENT. IF THIS WERE TO BECOME LAW WOULD THERE BE WHAT WOULD BE THE IMPACT OF THAT ON DISTILLING IT'S APPARENTLY ALREADY BEEN APPROVED WITHIN THE NATIONAL MONUMENT. YOU KNOW HOW IT WOULD. AFFECT SENT [inaudible] SO -- CLEARLY YOU KNOW THE THE THE CHALLENGE THAT WERE FACING IS THAT WE WE CAN'T JUST SHUT DOWN -- WELL WHAT'S HAPPENING ON FEDERAL LANDS AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT. WE WERE TRYING TO DISINCENTIVE EYES -- ANY ANY NEW OIL AND AND GAS. TO THE EXTENT THAT. THAT DOES IT IS THERE -- IS A YOU KNOW ALREADY ACTIVITY TAKING PLACE TO DEVELOP -- THE OIL AND GAS DEVELOPMENT ON CARISSA PLANES -- AGAIN WE ALL WE CAN DO WITH THE INTENT OF THE BILL AS IT IS TO TRY TO DENY THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THAT. MOVING ONWARD RIGHT -- MOVING FORWARD AND AGAIN JUST TO BE CLEAR -- FOCUS OF MY QUESTION NOT NECESSARILY. TO PROTECT THAT EXISTING OIL DRILLING INFRASTRUCTURE BUT I I WOULD THINK. EXTENT THERE'S BEEN INVESTMENT -- PERMITTING. IT WOULD RAISE AN ISSUE INCREASE SO PLAIN. IS ALSO THE SITE OF TWO MASSIVE. THOUSAND ACRE PLUS SOLAR FIELDS IT WENT THROUGH. MASSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT MITIGATION -- TO REACH THE POINT WHERE THEY ARE NOW. EATING INTO THE GRID THAT COMES OUT OF THE OUTLOOK CANYON SO. THERE'S BEEN A HUGE INVESTMENT -- SAFE RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION IN THE CREASE SO PLAIN AND THAT'S THE DIRECTION I THINK WE SHOULD BE GOING NOT. EXPLOITING PREVIOUSLY UNTAPPED -- COMPLETELY AGREE CENTER. BEGIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR EFFORTS WHEN WE HAVE A CORPSMAN LED TO BE SUPPORTIVE. THANKS THANK YOU.

WELCOME AND GOOD MORNING. THANK YOU CHAIR AND A SENATORS IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE THIS IS MY FIRST SENATE COMMITTEE MEETING SO. I'M VERY EXCITED TO BE PRESENTING EIGHTY FOUR SIXTY SEVEN TODAY. AB FOR SIXTY SEVEN WILL REQUIRE EQUAL PRIZE PAY FOR BOTH MEN AND WOMEN ATHLETES. WHEN COMPETING ON STATE PROPERTY IS FOR RECREATION? THE SPORTS WORLD HAS HISTORICALLY ENGAGED IN THE PRACTICE OF PAYING WOMEN MARKEDLY LESS THAN MEN. ACROSS THE SPORTS SECTOR PAYS DISPARITIES STILL EXIST FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY TEN X. GAMES THE FIRST PLACE PRIZE FOR THE FEMALE CATEGORY WHICH IS A SKATEBOARDING COMPETITION DISSIDENT NOW. THE FIRST PLACE PART PRICE FOR THE FEMALE CATEGORY TO COME TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. WELL HER MALE COUNTERPART TO CALM FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE US WOMEN'S SOCCER TEAM IS ANOTHER GREAT EXAMPLE OF A MAN AVERAGE 40% LESS THAN THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS ALTHOUGH THEY WERE THE WORLD CHAMPION. AND THE MELTING DIDN'T EVEN QUALIFY -- NO PLACE ELSE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO WE ACCEPT PAY INEQUITIES. IT'S ESSENTIAL THAT OUR STATE LANDS REFLECT OUR VALUES OF EQUALITY AND EQUITY. AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION ALONG WITH THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD ONLY LEAST PUBLIC BEACH FOR THE MAVERICKS OF COMPETITION. IF EQUAL PRIZE COMPENSATION WAS GUARANTEED TO BOTH THE MALE AND FEMALE CHAMPIONS. AB FOR SIXTY SEVEN CODIFIES THIS DECISION MADE BY THE COSTA COMMISSION OF THE STATE LANDS DECISION. A COMMISSION TO GRANT. ONLY IF THE PERSON PRICE FOR BOTH MALE AND FEMALE CATEGORIES ARTICLE. EIGHTY FOUR SIXTY SEVEN ALSO CODIFIED IN PERPETUITY THE GROUNDWORK LAID BY COUNTLESS FEMALE ATHLETES THAT HAVE BEEN ALSO STRONG AND POWERFUL ADVOCATES FOR PAY EQUITY. INCLUDING THE TO INSPIRING WOMEN SITTING HERE WITH ME TODAY. OUR STATE GOAL IS TO PROMOTE EQUALITY AND EQUITY ACROSS ALL SECTORS EIGHTY FOUR SIXTY SEVEN ENSURES THAT REGARDLESS OF YOUR WORKPLACE WOMEN ARE ENTITLED TO EQUAL PAY. AND WITH ME THEY F. CAM WOOZY AND CASTING BETWEEN WILL INTRODUCE THEMSELVES AMAZING ATHLETES JOINING US HERE IN THE SENATE CHAMBERS KIM. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. LEADER I AM THE CO FOUNDER OF THE WOMEN'S SKATEBOARDING ALLIANCE A GLOBAL CONSULTING AND SPUR ORGANIZING AGENCY -- WE HELP TO CREATE PRIZE PURSE PARITY AFTER THAT X. GAMES THAT TASHA REFERRED -- TO WE ALSO REPRESENT A COMMUNITY PROFESSIONAL AND AMATEUR FEMALE SKATEBOARDERS AROUND THE WORLD AND OVER THE PAST DECADE WE'VE BEEN WORKING TO INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN TO PURSUE SKATEBOARDING AS A PROFESSIONAL CAREER. I'M ALSO A CO FOUNDER OF SKI LIKE A GIRL A FIVE OH ONE C.. THREE I DIRECT THE BAY AREA CHAPTER AND WE PROVIDE FREE AND ACCESSIBLE PROGRAMMING AT PUBLIC SKATEPARKS IN IN SCHOOLS IN OUR MISSION IS TO CREATE AN INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE ENVIRONMENT. FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN MARGINALIZED IN BOTH THE STATE CULTURE AND SOCIETY WHICH INCLUDES YOUTH WOMEN TRANS WHERE. GENDER NON CONFORMING PEOPLE. THEIR SKATEBOARDING WE TEACH RESILIENCE CONFIDENCE LEADERSHIP AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE ADVISORY BOARD AT THE CENTER FOR SPORTS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY EAST BAY. AND THE CENTER IS COMMITTED TO INCLUDE IT CREATING EQUITY AND PROMOTING SOCIALLY JOSS INCLUSIVE SPORTS THROUGH RESEARCH AND EDUCATION. SO WITH FEW BARRIERS AND VERY. HIGH ACCESSIBILITY RATE SKATEBOARDING IS A SOCIAL MOVEMENT THAT'S EXPLODING AROUND THE WORLD. IT'S ONE OF THE FEW SPORTS WHERE PARTICIPANTS GET TO LEARN AND ENGAGE IN A PUBLIC SETTING. INTERSECTING AGE CLASS RACE AND GENDER DEPORTING TEACHES SELF ADVOCACY RESILIENT SELF EXPRESSION AND COMMUNITY BUILDING. SKATEPARKS HAVE BECOME A RADICAL VEHICLE OR SKATEBOARDS HAVE BECOME A RADICAL VEHICLE VEHICLE FOR TRANSFORMATION FOR MANY MARGINALIZED GROUPS INCLUDING WOMEN AND SKATE PARKS ARE MICROCOSM FOR SOCIETY. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT DISTINGUISH EQUITY VERSUS A QUALITY HERE. IS STARKLY SKATEBOARDING. IN SKATEBOARDING WOMEN HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED OBJECTIFIED AND TREATED UNEQUALLY AND HAVING SPENT THE PAST DECADE EFFECTIVELY ELEVATING WOMEN -- EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE FOR THE SPACE FOR WOMEN'S ONLY EVENTS BRANDS AND ORGANIZATIONS. AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR WOMEN TO CONTINUE BEING HEARD SPOT. SPOTLIGHTED AND PRIORITIZED AND THE CREATION OF EQUITY FOR WOMEN STARTING FROM THE PAY LEVEL IS A FOUNDATION OF ACHIEVING GENDER. EQUALITY THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. WELCOME. HELLO MY NAME IS KATHERINE ROUTINE I AM A RETIRED PROFESSIONAL CYCLIST AND FORMER COLUMNIST FOR ESPN. I NOW RUN THE HOME STRETCH FOUNDATION IN TUCSON ARIZONA THE NONPROFIT WHICH PROVIDES FEMALE PROFESSIONAL CYCLISTS. WITH. HE'S A WITH FREE HOUSING WHAT WE COMBAT THE GENDER PAY GAP. THAT IS GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES AND DISMANTLING THE ANTIQUATED RULES OF CYCLING'S GOVERNING BODY. WE WON A MAJOR VICTORY WHERE IN TWENTY TWENTY FEMALE PRO CYCLISTS WILL FINALLY RECEIVE A MANDATORY BASE SALARY AT THE WORLD TOUR LEVEL. BUT WE STILL CONTINUE TO FALL THROUGH THE LOOPHOLES OF PROGRESS AND EQUALITY. IN TWENTY NINETEEN WOMEN PROFESSIONAL CYCLISTS STILL DO NOT RECEIVE EQUAL ACCESS TO RACES. CALIFORNIA HAS THE MOST PRO BICYCLE RACE SAYS AND THE UNITED STATES. AND THE TOUR OF CALIFORNIA IS THE BIGGEST RACE. IN AMERICA AND IT CONTINUES UNFORTUNATELY TO HOLD WOMEN BACK THIS RACE HAS BEEN AROUND FOR FOURTEEN YEARS AND THE MANNER GIVEN SEVEN DAYS TO RACE AND WOMEN ARE ONLY GIVEN. THREE AND THAT'S TOKENISM IT'S UNACCEPTABLE AND IT SEEMS ALSO VERY ON CALIFORNIA IN. BUT THAT'S WHERE AB FOR SIXTY SEVEN COMES IN. HAVING EQUAL ACCESS TO THE ROADS AND HIGHWAYS IN CALIFORNIA WOULD SPECIFICALLY IMPACT CYCLING BY ALLOWING MEN AND WOMEN TO HAVE EQUAL REYES STAYS EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL PLAY. IDENTICAL COMPENSATION ACROSS EQUAL DAYS OF RACING IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IN. TWENTY NINETEEN EQUAL ACCESS NEEDS TO BE A GIVEN BY THIS POINT. AND CALIFORNIA CAN BE THE GAME CHANGING STATE THAT STEPS UP AND MAKES A QUALITY HAPPEN FOR WOMEN IN PRO CYCLING AND MANY OTHER SPORTS. UNLIKE THE US BIG BOX SPORTS THAT WERE USED TO THAT TAKE PLACE ON FIELDS AND COURTS AND RANKS. CYCLING AND ALSO SURFING REVOLVE AROUND ROADWAYS AND OCEANS AND TO DENY WOMEN ACCESS IN ANY SPORT IS WRONG BUT IT'S EVEN WORSE I THINK TO SAY THAT WOMEN DON'T DESERVE THE SAME ACCESS. FOR USING LAND AND WATER. I THINK THAT WE CAN CHANGE THIS TODAY BY BY PASSING A BEFORE. SIXTY SEVEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. YOU MISTER TIMBRES MICHAEL YOSHIHARA BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN LAWYERS ASSOCIATION FIGHTING FOR EQUAL PAY IN STRONG SUPPORT. SHERRI PEMBERTON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE LANDS COMMISSION IN SUPPORT. IN A SECOND THOUGHTS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE PARKS FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I FIND IT INTERESTING IN. APPLIED THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION IN THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION. BOTH. FOCUSED ON THE MAVERICKS -- PERMITTING AS A WAY. TO ADVANCE. THIS OBJECTIVE OF A QUALITY. IS THE FATHER OF TWO DAUGHTERS AND NOW THE FATHER OF GRANDFATHER OF TWO GRANDDAUGHTERS. TITLE NINE HAS BEEN A BIG COMPONENT IN OUR LIVES BUT IT'S NOT FULLY IMPLEMENT IN MY VIEW INTEL THERE'S A QUALITY AND ACCESS IN PRICES. FROM. IS A HISTORICAL FOOTNOTE I WAS A MEMBER OF THE KOBE SKATEBOARD TEAM IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AS AN EIGHTH GRADER. BUT IT WAS ALL GUYS -- BUT ON THE SIDEWALK WHEN WE MADE OUR OWN SKATEBOARDS. IT WAS GIRLS AND BOYS THAT CODE EACH OTHER BEHIND OUR BICYCLES IN HIT THOSE CRACKS IN THE SIDEWALKS. BUT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD AND IT PUTS A SPOTLIGHT AND I THINK ON THE AMGEN TOUR. IN THE NEXUS OF USING OUR STATE HIGHWAYS AND PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE. IT'S IT'S A GOOD PLACE TO FOCUS. THIS ADVANCE SO. THANK YOU AND WHEN WE HAVE A QUORUM I'D BE HONORED. TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD I THINK WE DO SO WHAT WOULD SICK ONE QUICK MOMENT I'LL COME TO YOU AND WILL ESTABLISH A QUORUM IF YOU DON'T MIND. OTHER OF INNER STRENGTH HERE HERE A JONES.

I WAS A SKATEBOARDER BUT IT NEVER WORKED FOR ME I I NEEDED MORE LESSONS BUT I DO WANT TO SAY -- THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR -- IN A PART OF THE CHALLENGE IS TO BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THIS RIGHT AND I THINK YOU'VE NARROWLY TAILORED THE BILL -- AND AND I THINK IT'LL WORK REALLY WELL I'M I'M I'M GONNA IS PRETTY TODAY AND ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF WE CAN GET IT LIKE A GIRL TO COME TO THIS. SAID THE CENTRAL VALLEY THERE'S LOTS OF SKATEBOARD PARKS AND I SEE NO GIRLS OUT THERE SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN. MAKE IT A SPORT WHERE A GIRL SEE THEMSELVES AND THEY SEE THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO LEARN A SKILL -- THE I THINK THE MORE MORE IMPORTANT I MEAN THE MORE WE CAN MAKE IT IMPORTANT TO THEM AND AND GIVE THEM SOMETHING TO LOOK FORWARD TO AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY APPRECIATE BOTH OF YOU. I I WOULD CAN KERR I I LOOK FOR THE WHEN. AB FOR SIXTY SEVEN IS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. WE CAN GO ON A STATE WIDE TOUR. BY BIKE. A BOARD BY SURFBOARD VERY RARE IN THIS COMMITTEE WE GET THE OPPORTUNITY.

DOZENS OF WELLS AND REMOVE THE PLATFORM. AB FIVE FOUR EIGHT FIVE EIGHTY FIVE CONTINUES LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE THE TAXPAYERS FUTURE FINANCIAL LIABILITY FOR DECOMMISSIONING OIL AND GAS INFRASTRUCTURE. SPECIFICALLY ASSEMBLY BILL FIVE EIGHTY FIVE CODIFIES EXISTING CRITERIA. THAT CALIFORNIA STATE LANDS COMMISSION ALREADY USES REVIEW APPLICATIONS TO TRANSFER A LEASE FROM ONE ENTITY TO ANOTHER FOR OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION. THIS BILL ALSO CLARIFIES CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS THAT A LEASE SEES A CREATE A CRUISE THE COMMISSION OBLIGATIONS WHEN THE LEASE IS TRANSFERRED. AND THAT WHEN THE LEASE ENDS THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY CLAIMS LIABILITY AND STARTS DE COMMISSIONING WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME FRAME. FINALLY AB FIVE EIGHTY FIVE CLARIFIES THAT WHEN A STATE AGENCY UNDERTAKES A DE COMMISSIONING OPERATION. TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY IT IS DOING SO UNDER THEIR EXISTING POLICE POWERS I WORK WITH OPPOSITION AND CAN REPORT THAT THEY ARE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL. THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR PARTICIPATING IN STAKEHOLDERS MEETINGS I HAVE WITH ME TODAY AS SHERRY PEMBERTON WITH THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL.

I'LL JUST START JUST QUICK QUESTIONS A MEMBER NOW I'LL COME OVER TO THEIR HERTZBERG SO -- APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK YOU PUT IN. THANK YOU ALSO TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON IT. SHE'S SHE'S WALKING ME THROUGH WHAT YOU'RE ANTICIPATING NOW IN TERMS OF THE TWEAK. TO CAN YOU JUST WALK ME THROUGH IT IN REAL TIME HERE FOR YEAH AND WE AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE COPIES OF MEMBERS WANT TO SEE A COPY OF THE AMENDMENTS AND THAT WE HOPE WILL BE TAKEN UP. AT NINE IN THE WILL PASS THOSE OUT IF. TO THE BRINK. OF THE STRIP THANK YOU. SO DO YOU WANT ME TO READ THE WHOLE THING. SHE MIGHT MY STAFF IS SAYING IT'S JUST -- IS THERE ARE THEY EXPENSIVE I THOUGHT THAT THIS IS -- YES SO IT'S UNDER AT ITEM BE. ONE ON ONE SECOND THAT WOULD WOULD YOU MIND JUST WE GET THAT DISTRIBUTED WHATEVER SHE'S GOT THERE THANK YOU. ART INTERRUPT YOUR THESE ARE MINOR IN TECHNICAL AMENDMENT UNDERSTOOD. WHAT IS BEING [inaudible] PERSNICKETY. YES BUT THAT MY STAFF IS THAT THEY ARE TECHNICAL IN NATURE SO JUST WANNA. THANK YOU SO MUCH. ALL RIGHT VERY GOOD. YES I'M SAYING IT'S IN BE -- ONE ANY ANY OTHER PARTY AND CRIER IN LIKE. RIGHT. SO PRIOR IS BEING STRAIGHT OUT AND THEN. UNDER ITEM BE ONE EIGHTY AND UNDER BE ONE SEE ANY OTHER PARTY THAT IS. TAKEN OUT AND NOW SAYS OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY [inaudible] VERY GOOD -- MEMBERS QUESTIONS. HERTZBERG LIKE YES LANCE COMMISSION WHY IS THIS BILL NECESSARY IN VIEW OF ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN ONE ADDITIONAL FACTORS. JUST HAVE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A BOND ANY ANYBODY'S INSURANCE COMPANIES GOING TO LOOK AT THESE OF CONSIDERATIONS IT SEEMS TO ME YOU'RE PUT IN SUSPENDERS ON ON A WITH WITH WITH THE BELT. I JUST CURIOUS. THANK YOU SENATOR THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK THAT THE SPELL IS COMPLEMENTARY AND GOES HAND IN HAD WITH SB AT ELEVEN FORTY SEVEN IT DOESN'T FOCUS SO MUCH ON INCREASING THE BONDS WHEN THERE'S A POTENTIAL LEASE ASSIGNMENT OR TRANSFER. BUT IT FOCUSES ON LOOKING AT THAT THAT POTENTIAL NEW LASSIE AND WHETHER THEY HAVE A GOOD RECORD. ARE FINANCIALLY ABLE TO FULFILL THE TERMS IN THE LEASE AND THEN IT HAS A NUMBER OF OTHER PROVISIONS THAT ALSO PROVIDES MORE TRANSPARENCY BY REQUIRING THAT ANY ASSIGNMENT IS RECORDED IN THE COUNTY WHERE THE LANDS ARE. AND IT IS MORE. SPECIFIC ABOUT WHEN DE COMMISSIONING A LIABILITY OR COME ON THE INSURANCE COMPANY REQUIRE THAT NOBODY'S GONNA WRITE A BOND. IT'S GONNA ACT THEY CAN ASK EVERYONE THESE QUESTIONS IS THERE CONCERN ABOUT THE REST. THEY'RE GONNA MAKE SURE I GET IT BUT THE METS WHITES BUT BUILT AS SPENDERS THAT ARE YOU REALLY SOLVING THE PROBLEM IF I'M AN INSURANCE COMPANY I'M GONNA NO ONE KNOW WHAT THOSE WAS. I'M GONNA HAVE TO ENSURE AGAINST THEM AND I'M GONNA WANNA EVERYONE OF THESE FACTORS ARE I JUST SIMPLY RESTATING WHAT ADDRESS COMPANIES ALREADY DONE NOTHING MINUTES NOT A WRONG THING TO DO BUT I DON'T. IS BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT SAYING IT BUT NOBODY WILL TAKE ON A WRIST. OR BOND WE HAD THIS PROBLEM PLATFORM HOLLY WE DEALT WITH THAT. AND THE QUESTION IS I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NATIONAL FACTORS THAT WOULD HAPPEN THAT MAY BE BUT EVEN STATUTES VERSES OPERATION Là BUT BY BUT BY OPERATION OF OUR INSURANCE COMPANIES WORK. NOBODY IS GOING TO GO OUT AND TAKE ON A RISK UNLESS THEY MAKING SURE THAT THESE PROBLEMS ARE TAKING CARE OF YEAH YEAH A BIG PORTION OF THIS BILL APPLIES TO THE POTENTIAL FOR A EXISTING LESSEE TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY AND LEAVE THE STATE RESPONSIBLE. AND IN THAT CASE EVEN IF THERE IS A BOND IT WOULD FALL SHORT OF WHAT'S REQUIRED FOR THE FULL DE COMMISSIONING. SO THIS BILL TRIES TO SET OUT I TOOK TO PROVIDE TOOLS AND PROTECT THE COMMISSION IN THE EVENT THAT. THERE IS A BANKRUPTCY FIVE BEST A FINE WHEN A LIABILITY. STARTS IF THERE IS A LEASE TRANSFER AND THEN ALSO PROVIDING A COUPLE DIFFERENT OPTIONS IF THERE'S A POTENTIAL TRANSFER AND THE COMMISSION HAS THE AUTHORITY TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE STATE. THERE IS THE OPTION FOR THE POTENTIAL LESSEE. TO PUT UP FRONT A 100% OF THE SECURITY FOR THE FULL COST OF DECOMMISSIONING TO REMOVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN ABANDON ALL THE WELLS SO WE HAVE THAT MONEY IN. IN IN OUR HANDS RATHER THAN THE POTENTIAL SCENARIO OF BANKRUPTCY. IT IT IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN JUST JUST THE BOND MECHANISM WITH. BUT AS A SUPER AT CHALLENGING ISSUE IN THE CONTEXT OF OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASES BUT IT'S REALLY BROADER AND PROVIDES THE STATE WITH MORE TOOLS. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF ENUMERATION HERE OF POWERS POSTED JUST RELYING ON PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE -- THAT CODIFICATION SEEMS SIGNIFICANT ESPECIALLY BASED ON THE DALLAS PROCEEDING I BELIEVE THERE'S JUST A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING IN TEXAS I'M NOT MISTAKEN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO SOME OF THESE BILLS. OR SUSPENDERS WHATEVER MAY BE CENTER CABALLERO. STILL BACK INTO THAT THE BELTS AND SUSPENDERS THE MAY FIRST QUESTION WAS WHY IS THE BILL NEEDED IN THE SECOND ONE IS. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE BECAUSE IF YOU'VE ALREADY. BEEN DOING THIS. THEN THE QUESTION BECOMES WHAT DO WE GAIN BY CODIFYING IT THAT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ALREADY AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF YOU SET UP A PROCESS. THAT YOU GOT THE AUTHORITY. TO MAKE THAT PROCESS SIX FIVE AS FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE AND ONCE WE CODIFY IT THAT'S IT THERE'S NO OTHER OPTIONS IN TERMS OF THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT TOM. TURNED TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO SOLVE IT. YEAH A COUPLE THINGS -- WE ARE WE ARE. ESSENTIALLY CODIFYING AND THE FIRST PART OF THE BILL WHAT OUR CURRENT PRACTICES WHEN WE CONSIDER WHETHER TO APPROVE A LEASE TRANSFER OR ASSIGNMENT -- BUT THE BILL IS IS. IT JUST TRIES TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT THOSE FACTORS WOULD BE AN BILL IS IS ALSO IN RESPONSE TO WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN IN RECENT YEARS AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN VENN ECHO A MAJOR. LET'S SEE OFF SHORE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY AND LEFT THE STATE RESPONSIBLE. FOR ALL OF THAT I REMEDIATION AND FINANCIAL COST FOR THE PLATFORM AND ALL THE WELLS AND IT'S A REALLY IMMENSE COST AND AN UNDERTAKING. AND SO WHEN WE'VE REFLECTED BACK ON ON THAT SCENARIO AND ALSO RINCON ISLAND ANOTHER MAJOR. OFF SHORE LET'S SEE WHO FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY WE REALIZE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY WE SHOULD GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE STATUTE AND LOOK AT WAYS. AND IT CAN BE UPDATED SO IN THE FUTURE IF WE ARE IN A IN A POSITION WHERE THERE'S A MAJOR LESSEE WHO'S POTENTIALLY TERMINATING OR QUICK CLAIMING ARE FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY WE HAVE MORE TOOLS. WE REALLY WANT TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE SO THE STATE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FINANCIAL LIABILITY. OR FOR PROTECTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY IN AN ENVIRONMENT IF A MAJOR. OR MINOR OFFICER OPERATOR FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY. SO I AGREE WITH EVERYTHING YOU SAID THE WHAT ARE THE NEW TOOLS AND THE NEW YEAH THE NEW -- AB ABILITIES THAT. ME AND AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT I I SUPPORT EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT. I GET WORRIED ABOUT GIVING AUTHORITY AWAY IN IN CERTAIN INSTANCES WITHOUT THEN TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT. WHAT ARE WE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IS THE AUTHORITY THAT WERE GRANTING? IT DOESN'T HAVE TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE OR THAT JUST PUT IT ON AUTOMATIC PILOT SO I JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THAT. YEAH THANK YOU -- IT IS IN PART CLARIFYING OUR EXISTING PRACTICE SO AND IN THAT SENSE JUST RELATED TO A CONSIDERING WHETHER TO APPROVE A TRANSFER. IT'S IT'S NOT PROVIDING ANY ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY IT'S JUST CODIFYING THOSE THOSE FACTORS WHICH IS IMPORTANT IT'S ALSO PROVIDING MORE TRANSPARENCY BY REQUIRING THAT AT LEAST THAT'S ASSIGNED OR TRANSFERRED AS RECORDED IN THE COUNTY WHERE THE LANDS ARE. IT ALSO PROVIDES MORE SPECIFICITY ABOUT WHEN THE LIABILITY OBLIGATIONS A CREW FOR DECOMMISSIONING. SO IT'S VERY SPECIFIC WITH IF THERE IS A LEASE ASSIGNMENTS BUT THE COMMISSION APPROVES. THIS BILL CLARIFIES IN LAW WHEN THE LIABILITY -- STARTS AND AT THE PRIOR OPERATOR IS NOT. ABSOLVED FROM THEIR LIABILITY OBLIGATIONS IT ALSO I CLARIFIES THAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS LIKE WITH AN ECHO AND THE STATE HAS TO STEP IN. BECAUSE THERE'S A PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AN ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARD BECAUSE THE OPERATOR -- LET'S SEE ABANDONED THE FACILITIES BUT THE STATE'S DOING NOT IN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR POLICE POWERS. AND SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT'S ALSO IN RESPONSE TO WHAT WE LEARNED AFTER -- THE FENNICA BANKRUPTCY. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. TINO FURTHER CALL CHINS -- REMEMBER LATER CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU -- PLEASE CALL HELLO ACTUALLY WE NEED A MOTION -- COVER YOUR MOVESTHE BILL THE THE MOTION IS TO PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS THE AMENDMENTS DISCUSSED IT WILL BE ADOPTED IN APPROPRIATIONS.

I AM HERE TO PRESENT AB FIVE FIVE SIX WHICH WILL HELP PROVIDE OUTDOOR EXPERIENCES. TO DISADVANTAGED YOUTH AND IMPROVE THEIR OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL BEING. THIS IS SIMILAR TO THE BILL WE RAN LAST YEAR AB TWENTY SIX FOURTEEN WHICH ENJOYED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK -- AND SO HERE WE ARE AGAIN. THAT MANY YOUNG PEOPLE FROM URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE LITTLE TO NO ACCESS TO OUTDOOR EXPERIENCES. EVEN WHEN THEY LIVE MINUTES AWAY FROM THE SPACES. THE LACK OF ACCESS IS LARGELY DUE TO EXCESSIVE TRANSPORTATION AND ACCOMMODATION COSTS. EXTENDED TIME OUTDOORS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO DRAMATICALLY IMPROVE INDIVIDUALS MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH PARTICULARLY FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS CAN ENCOURAGE GREATER CIVIC ENGAGEMENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES THAT ARE CURRENTLY AT HAND. AND CAN HELP FOSTER FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP THIS IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT I KNOW QUITE WELL. AS A YOUNG PERSON. THAT WENT THROUGH SIMILAR PROGRAMS WHEN I WAS YOUNG AND NOW HERE I AM ADVOCATING FOR THE SAME PROGRAM STATEWIDE. AB FIVE THIRTY SIX WILL TASK THE NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCY WITH CREATING COMMUNITY ACCESS PROGRAM. TO ENABLE ALL CALIFORNIANS TO REACHING UTILIZED NATURAL EDUCATIONAL RECREATIONAL RESOURCES. THE BILL ALSO ALLOW FOR THE CREATION OF A GRANT PROGRAM PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR INNOVATIVE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS TO FOSTER MORE ACCESS. FOR THOSE WHO ARE OFTEN DENIED THESE EXPERIENCES -- WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS JOSE GONZALEZ FOUNDER OF LATINO OUTDOORS ONE OF THEM IT ON ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR OF THE POLICY FOR THE AUDUBON CALIFORNIA.

FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE FOCUS ON FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES WITH WHOM -- CAN BENEFIT KNOWING THAT. KIND OF THE PRESENT AND FUTURE CONSERVATION STEWART'S AND LEADERS OF OUR STATE ALL RIGHT HERE AND I GET TO BE AN EXAMPLE OF THAT AS WELL. ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS IN NATURE KIND OF SEEMS LIKE IT'S A BIRTHRIGHT FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS I THINK AT TIMES HE WOULD TAKE IT FOR GRANTED TO ME YOU SEE THE PAINTING RIGHT BEHIND YOU. IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE PROUD OF AS A STATE AND TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S EQUITABLE ACCESS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS THAT THINKING WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO DO WELL. I DO THIS RIGHT AND DO RIGHT BY A LOT OF OUR COMMUNITIES -- WHO DON'T HAVE THESE THESE OPPORTUNITIES I WAS ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM INTRODUCTORY OUTDOOR EXPERIENCES AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL STUDENTS ASIDE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT? AND THEN EVEN AS A COLLEGE STUDENT IN ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WAS TRANSPORTATION AXIS ONE OF THOSE TO KEEP THINGS AS BEING ABLE TO GO. NOT JUST ON SCHOOL SPONSORED BUT ALSO COMMUNITY SPONSORED AND JUST MY OWN FAMILY FINDING THEIR WAY TO SOME OF THESE NATURAL RESOURCES AND THAT'S WHAT'S PART KIND OF THIS THE EXCITEMENT AND LOVE FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS WORK. WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IS BE ABLE TO SAY. PHONE IS FOR THIS TO BE PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE OUTDOORS AND IT'S A CRITICAL REQUIREMENT THAT ALL DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES ON UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE NATURAL RESOURCE AGENCY HAVE THIS. IS A DIRECTIVE SO FOR THESE REASONS AND MORE WHICH WILL BE ABLE TO SHARE AFTER THE SHOW MORE ABOUT.

I'M PLACES ON THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE MANY KIDS IN SALINAS AND I'VE NEVER SEEN THE BEACH AND IT'S PROP MILES FROM THE OCEAN AS THE CROW FLIES. I'M IN AND SO -- ONE OF THAT ONE OF THE BUGS I WANT TO PUT IN YOUR BECAUSE I'M I'M I THINK THAT THERE'S A REAL NEED TO LOOK AT THIS AS WELL AS THAT. YOU KNOW BACK WHEN THERE WAS A FISCAL CRISIS AND THE STATE WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO WITH OUR STATE PARKS -- AN INVENTORY OF THE PARKS WAS REALLY ILLUSTRATIVE AND THEN WE GOT DATA ON HOW MANY VISITS. TO THE PARKS AND THE PARKS THAT WORD NOT. AS BUSY IN OTHER WORDS COLLECT MUCH MONEY WORD SLATED FOR CLOSURE AND THAT ULTIMATELY WAS STOPPED BECAUSE FRANKLY MOST OF THOSE WERE IN WERE IN RURAL COMMUNITIES WHERE -- THERE IT'S NOT THAT NATURAL IT'S A DIFFERENT NATURAL BEAUTY THAN THAN THAT THE STATE PARK ON THE BEACH WHICH GET A LOT OF ATTENTION AND SO. I'M I THINK THERE'S A REAL NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE FIND OUT HOW. HOW ARE STATE PARKS ARE? DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND I A I A REPRESENT AN AREA WHERE THERE VERY FEW STATE PARKS AND WHERE IF THERE'S A STATE PARK THE IVESTMENT IN THAT PARK IS VERY. LOW I'M BY THE STATE BECAUSE WELL. FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS BUT I I WANNA APPLIED YOU FOR THE IDEA OF TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE A STATE PARK OPEN. BUT TRANSPORTATION OTHER PARKS AS WELL IS REALLY IMPORTANT -- AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT LIMITS PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO GET TO SOME OF THESE PARKS -- BUT BUT THERE'S ALSO I THINK WE NEED TO BUILD AND MAYBEIT'S THROUGH THE NONPROFIT TO AS WELL THIS IS THIS CAPACITY FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THERE ARE PLACES THAT THEY CAN GO THAT THEY FELT. ARC THAT THEIR CULTURALLY COMPETENT TYPES OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE PARK AND THEY FEEL COMFORTABLE GOING AS WELL SO AND THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY IMPORTANT WHEN APPLIED YOUR WORK ON THIS I'M IT IT SOME. REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK WE'LL GET IT TO THIS GOVERNOR AND I THINK I'LL HAVE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT APPROACH TO IT BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR AND THANK YOU FOR TO THE NONPROFIT FOR YOUR WORK AS WELL IT IT IS -- THAT. MOST RECENT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT IT'S NOT JUST THE PHYSICAL. HEALTH IMPROVEMENT THAT IT'S THE MENTAL HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS THAT -- THAT THE SPACES CREATE AND SO THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE PEOPLE WALKING IN NATURE AND THE FEEL THE SERENITY IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO SOME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER CENTER BORDERS. WASN'T PLANNING ON SPEAKING BUT CENTER HERTZBERG ANSWER CABALLERO INSPIRED ME. I TOO WANTED TO COMMEND YOU FOR THIS [inaudible] I WAS. I WAS A I SERVED AS CHAIR OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER CONSERVANCY OFFER A NUMBER OF YEARS. AND THERE WAS A DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY ONLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED METERS. FROM RIVER ACCESS. FOR THE LIFE OF ME I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHY. IT WAS NOT MORE INTERACTION BETWEEN THAT COMMUNITY AND BEAUTIFUL NATURAL RESOURCES. IN REPRESENTING THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH INCLUDE SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAIN RANGES SO ON AND SO FORTH. WHY INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT ENJOYING IN USING? THESE AMENITIES MORE OFTEN IS STRIKING BUT YOU HAVE TO CREATE THE OPPORTUNITIES THE PLATFORMS WITH TRANSPORTATION FOR THE AWARENESS -- SO I COMMEND YOU FOR THIS DEFINITELY HAPPY TO SUPPORT. THANKS THEIR BORDERS I'M. THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS BACK. SECOND TIME'S GOING TO BE A CHARM. BUT I HAVE A QUESTION THAT'S% SOMEWHAT TECHNICAL BUT ALSO -- RATHER TIMELY. I WANT WE NEED TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS A POLICY FRAMEWORK AND I I LARGER WOULD LOVE TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL MOVES THROUGH WHEN I WANT RESOURCE TO GET MOVING ON THIS PROGRAM BUT WHEN FIGHTING ALL. YEAR TRY TO GET COMMUNITY ACCESS ELEVATED. AND IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD RIGHT NOW LOOKS LIKE -- BUDGET HEARING IN TINKERING AROUND NUANCES TO BOND LAW -- HAS ONCE AGAIN STALLED OUT OUR EFFORTS TO ACTUALLY GET TRANSPORTATION SERVICES YES LOW COST ACCOMMODATIONS MATTER YES NEW ACQUISITIONS MATTER BUT IF KNOWING GET TO THESE ACCOMMODATIONS OR ENTITIES NEW LANDS. THAT WERE WERE LAWSUIT DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK FOR US MISTER ADDED ON THOUGH ON THE STATE OF PLAY IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'VE ACTUALLY GOT IN THE PIPELINE TO MAKE. THIS PROGRAM WORK OR WHAT MORE WE NEED TO DO. NOT REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT OF A LITTLE KNOWN BEHALF OF LATINO ADORES PROCEED QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS FROM ALL THE THE SENATORS. SO -- AS AS IS MENTIONED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS -- THE QUESTION OF FUNDING HAS BEEN THE THORNY ISSUE ON ON THESE PROPOSALS. WE IN THE VETO MESSAGE THE GOVERNOR POINTED TO PROP SIXTY EIGHT AS THE REASON WHY THIS IS ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF BUT IT REALLY -- THAT THE VETO MESSAGE FOCUSED ON TWO AND SEVEN SEVEN MILLION FROM PROP SIXTY EIGHT THAT IS REALLY DIFFERENT YOU KNOW WHAT THOSE THOSE DOLLARS ARE GOING TO BUILD PARKS AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES USING THE AB THIRTY ONE FRAMEWORK. WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AS AS WE JUST HEARD IS BRINGING FOLKS OUT TO THESE PLACES AND NOT JUST A PARKS EITHER IN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT -- WETLANDS ANOTHER PRESERVES ARE ALSO IN CENTRAL VALLEY WHERE WHERE FOLKS CAN ACCESS -- NATURE -- THROUGH THOSE VENUES AS WELL -- AND MANY OTHERS -- THROUGH DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS DFW AND WHILE THE CONSERVATION BOARD SERRA -- SPECIFICALLY TO THE QUESTION OF FUNDING FOR THIS YEAR WE ARE AWARE THAT THE ASSEMBLY PUT FORWARD A PROPOSAL TO TO MAKE SOME FUNDING AVAILABLE IN THE BUDGET -- IN COORDINATION WITH -- PROPOSALS ARE MOVING TO A LEGISLATURE INCLUDING -- ASSUMING RECOVERY IS. FIVE FIVE SIX SOME AND I THINK THAT THEY'RE STILL POTENTIALLY AN OPPORTUNITY THERE SO IF THERE IS AN URGENCY IF THERE IS A DESIRE ON THE SENATE SIDE. I THINK WE COULD -- WE COULD PROBABLY MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN THIS YEAR -- THROUGH THROUGH A FLEXIBLE FUND SOURCES LIKE THE UMBRELLA LICENSE PLATE FUNDRAISER SPECIAL FUNDS SOURCES ARE OUT THERE SO WOULD LOVE TO TO COORDINATE A COME BACK TO HAVE A CONVERSATION.
